00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:26.780 align:start position:0%
9 30 on uh June
 
00:05:31.249 --> 00:05:31.259 align:start position:0%
27th I'd like to call to order the work
 
00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:36.060 align:start position:0%
session on the special committee on uh
 
00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:38.580 align:start position:0%
the Family Division
 
00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:39.950 align:start position:0%
the Family Division
uh

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:39.960 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:45.180 align:start position:0%
as you see in the calendar and what we
 
00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:47.100 align:start position:0%
talked about when we last met two weeks
 
00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:50.100 align:start position:0%
ago this is a work session
 
00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:54.380 align:start position:0%
um we're not taking testimony today
 
00:05:57.230 --> 00:05:57.240 align:start position:0%
we are
 
00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:01.160 align:start position:0%
meeting in order to assess
 
00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:06.000 align:start position:0%
what areas committee members might
 
00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:10.440 align:start position:0%
be working on in the next few months
 
00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:12.720 align:start position:0%
because the committee
 
00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:13.909 align:start position:0%
because the committee
under

00:06:13.909 --> 00:06:13.919 align:start position:0%
under
 
00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:17.340 align:start position:0%
house rules will not be meeting again as
 
00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:19.860 align:start position:0%
a committee until September
 
00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:23.400 align:start position:0%
so that gives us time to go through a
 
00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:25.560 align:start position:0%
lot of materials that have been
 
00:06:28.969 --> 00:06:28.979 align:start position:0%
submitted to us and also materials that
 
00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:31.340 align:start position:0%
we would like to read
 
00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:34.440 align:start position:0%
so that we can come back in the fall
 
00:06:37.129 --> 00:06:37.139 align:start position:0%
again ready to
 
00:06:37.139 --> 00:06:38.450 align:start position:0%
again ready to
um

00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:38.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:06:43.029 --> 00:06:43.039 align:start position:0%
move forward on on what will be a report
 
00:06:47.629 --> 00:06:47.639 align:start position:0%
that we file and the expectation is that
 
00:06:50.409 --> 00:06:50.419 align:start position:0%
that will be sometime
 
00:06:52.749 --> 00:06:52.759 align:start position:0%
before November
 
00:06:57.550 --> 00:06:57.560 align:start position:0%
and there are obviously two major
 
00:07:02.629 --> 00:07:02.639 align:start position:0%
avenues that we can pursue one of them
 
00:07:04.969 --> 00:07:04.979 align:start position:0%
um would be
 
00:07:08.529 --> 00:07:08.539 align:start position:0%
um once we get past our general
 
00:07:12.469 --> 00:07:12.479 align:start position:0%
comments would be a suggestion of
 
00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:17.240 align:start position:0%
legislation that we think could help the
 
00:07:22.670 --> 00:07:22.680 align:start position:0%
family uh courts better meet the needs
 
00:07:25.309 --> 00:07:25.319 align:start position:0%
of the citizens of the state and another
 
00:07:27.129 --> 00:07:27.139 align:start position:0%
would be
 
00:07:27.139 --> 00:07:28.850 align:start position:0%
would be
suggestions

00:07:28.850 --> 00:07:28.860 align:start position:0%
suggestions
 
00:07:32.089 --> 00:07:32.099 align:start position:0%
to the um
 
00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:35.940 align:start position:0%
to the separate branch of the um the
 
00:07:37.969 --> 00:07:37.979 align:start position:0%
judicial branch which is of course
 
00:07:40.570 --> 00:07:40.580 align:start position:0%
separated from the legislative branch
 
00:07:44.870 --> 00:07:44.880 align:start position:0%
about areas that they might look into
 
00:07:47.390 --> 00:07:47.400 align:start position:0%
where we think
 
00:07:49.490 --> 00:07:49.500 align:start position:0%
there could be things that they could do
 
00:07:52.189 --> 00:07:52.199 align:start position:0%
in their jurisdiction that would again
 
00:07:56.089 --> 00:07:56.099 align:start position:0%
make the family courts best meet the
 
00:07:59.510 --> 00:07:59.520 align:start position:0%
needs of the citizens of the state so
 
00:08:02.469 --> 00:08:02.479 align:start position:0%
that's our general plan I want to repeat
 
00:08:05.870 --> 00:08:05.880 align:start position:0%
yet again something that has been said
 
00:08:08.870 --> 00:08:08.880 align:start position:0%
any number of times but when people
 
00:08:11.270 --> 00:08:11.280 align:start position:0%
feel deeply about things they don't
 
00:08:14.390 --> 00:08:14.400 align:start position:0%
necessarily listen because they're
 
00:08:16.850 --> 00:08:16.860 align:start position:0%
waiting to say what they want to say and
 
00:08:19.550 --> 00:08:19.560 align:start position:0%
I want to repeat once again under no
 
00:08:22.249 --> 00:08:22.259 align:start position:0%
circumstances and never was it
 
00:08:24.469 --> 00:08:24.479 align:start position:0%
considered nor will it be considered
 
00:08:28.670 --> 00:08:28.680 align:start position:0%
that this committee will act as if it
 
00:08:31.570 --> 00:08:31.580 align:start position:0%
were a trial or Appellate Court
 
00:08:36.529 --> 00:08:36.539 align:start position:0%
to to take any action on specific cases
 
00:08:39.829 --> 00:08:39.839 align:start position:0%
that have been filed and have been acted
 
00:08:45.110 --> 00:08:45.120 align:start position:0%
on and under no circumstances
 
00:08:47.930 --> 00:08:47.940 align:start position:0%
um will we be
 
00:08:47.940 --> 00:08:49.790 align:start position:0%
um will we be
um

00:08:49.790 --> 00:08:49.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:52.210 --> 00:08:52.220 align:start position:0%
uh changing
 
00:08:56.810 --> 00:08:56.820 align:start position:0%
any decisions that have been made by the
 
00:08:56.820 --> 00:08:57.590 align:start position:0%
any decisions that have been made by the
core

00:08:57.590 --> 00:08:57.600 align:start position:0%
core
 
00:09:01.790 --> 00:09:01.800 align:start position:0%
those actions must be taken by the
 
00:09:04.250 --> 00:09:04.260 align:start position:0%
judicial branch if the judicial branch
 
00:09:07.610 --> 00:09:07.620 align:start position:0%
chooses to do so the legislative branch
 
00:09:10.310 --> 00:09:10.320 align:start position:0%
is separate from the judicial branch and
 
00:09:13.610 --> 00:09:13.620 align:start position:0%
we will do what we can to fulfill our
 
00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:15.710 align:start position:0%
we will do what we can to fulfill our
obligations

00:09:15.710 --> 00:09:15.720 align:start position:0%
obligations
 
00:09:21.590 --> 00:09:21.600 align:start position:0%
um in in terms of creating policy and so
 
00:09:24.290 --> 00:09:24.300 align:start position:0%
um I know that no matter how many times
 
00:09:26.889 --> 00:09:26.899 align:start position:0%
we've said this
 
00:09:30.550 --> 00:09:30.560 align:start position:0%
people who are feeling deeply concerned
 
00:09:33.710 --> 00:09:33.720 align:start position:0%
still want to
 
00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:35.210 align:start position:0%
still want to
uh

00:09:35.210 --> 00:09:35.220 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:09:38.930 --> 00:09:38.940 align:start position:0%
I still are hoping that somehow
 
00:09:41.509 --> 00:09:41.519 align:start position:0%
magic will fall from the sky and the
 
00:09:44.150 --> 00:09:44.160 align:start position:0%
judicial branch will take on
 
00:09:45.949 --> 00:09:45.959 align:start position:0%
um well the legislature will take on
 
00:09:47.930 --> 00:09:47.940 align:start position:0%
judicial responsibilities and we will
 
00:09:50.870 --> 00:09:50.880 align:start position:0%
not do that we respect the separation of
 
00:09:53.269 --> 00:09:53.279 align:start position:0%
powers and so I want everybody to be
 
00:09:56.990 --> 00:09:57.000 align:start position:0%
clear about that however we have heard a
 
00:10:01.190 --> 00:10:01.200 align:start position:0%
lot of testimony up until now from a
 
00:10:04.490 --> 00:10:04.500 align:start position:0%
range of witnesses from people who are
 
00:10:06.590 --> 00:10:06.600 align:start position:0%
Advocates people who have professional
 
00:10:08.930 --> 00:10:08.940 align:start position:0%
responsibilities and people who have
 
00:10:12.490 --> 00:10:12.500 align:start position:0%
felt that the courts have not met their
 
00:10:17.389 --> 00:10:17.399 align:start position:0%
their concerns and all of that we will
 
00:10:19.670 --> 00:10:19.680 align:start position:0%
now have some time over the summer to
 
00:10:21.650 --> 00:10:21.660 align:start position:0%
review and to think about and to learn
 
00:10:24.829 --> 00:10:24.839 align:start position:0%
from people's experiences but I I do
 
00:10:26.090 --> 00:10:26.100 align:start position:0%
want to repeat
 
00:10:29.449 --> 00:10:29.459 align:start position:0%
for what's probably the 30th time we are
 
00:10:32.090 --> 00:10:32.100 align:start position:0%
not an appellate court we are not a
 
00:10:37.910 --> 00:10:37.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:41.930 --> 00:10:41.940 align:start position:0%
be involved through this body in any
 
00:10:45.290 --> 00:10:45.300 align:start position:0%
review of judicial actions that would
 
00:10:47.449 --> 00:10:47.459 align:start position:0%
you know would appear to be
 
00:10:47.459 --> 00:10:48.550 align:start position:0%
you know would appear to be
um

00:10:48.550 --> 00:10:48.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:51.949 --> 00:10:51.959 align:start position:0%
appealing or retrying cases that have
 
00:10:53.810 --> 00:10:53.820 align:start position:0%
been heard before the judicial branch
 
00:10:56.750 --> 00:10:56.760 align:start position:0%
and um does anyone on the committee have
 
00:10:59.710 --> 00:10:59.720 align:start position:0%
anything they'd like to add to that
 
00:11:04.069 --> 00:11:04.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:06.410 --> 00:11:06.420 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair so uh yeah I was
 
00:11:08.509 --> 00:11:08.519 align:start position:0%
looking for a report but
 
00:11:10.490 --> 00:11:10.500 align:start position:0%
this special committee is not reporting
 
00:11:13.190 --> 00:11:13.200 align:start position:0%
out we're just recommending uh
 
00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:15.769 align:start position:0%
out we're just recommending uh
legislation

00:11:15.769 --> 00:11:15.779 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:11:15.779 --> 00:11:16.910 align:start position:0%
legislation
so

00:11:16.910 --> 00:11:16.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:11:18.710 --> 00:11:18.720 align:start position:0%
it's not even a report that we're giving
 
00:11:19.790 --> 00:11:19.800 align:start position:0%
out it's
 
00:11:21.590 --> 00:11:21.600 align:start position:0%
our charge is just to recommend
 
00:11:24.710 --> 00:11:24.720 align:start position:0%
legislation if we see fit I I think
 
00:11:26.990 --> 00:11:27.000 align:start position:0%
that's absolutely true but as we all
 
00:11:28.910 --> 00:11:28.920 align:start position:0%
know it might come to pass in the
 
00:11:31.250 --> 00:11:31.260 align:start position:0%
fullness of time that as we see how
 
00:11:33.889 --> 00:11:33.899 align:start position:0%
things have unfold unfolded it might be
 
00:11:37.430 --> 00:11:37.440 align:start position:0%
appropriate for us to set a context
 
00:11:40.310 --> 00:11:40.320 align:start position:0%
for what we're going to do
 
00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:41.030 align:start position:0%
for what we're going to do
um

00:11:41.030 --> 00:11:41.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:11:44.569 --> 00:11:44.579 align:start position:0%
but I I appreciate your comment and it
 
00:11:46.250 --> 00:11:46.260 align:start position:0%
does you know remind us that there are
 
00:11:49.069 --> 00:11:49.079 align:start position:0%
limits to all that we do or that we can
 
00:11:53.630 --> 00:11:53.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:55.790 align:start position:0%
 
no

00:11:55.790 --> 00:11:55.800 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:57.710 align:start position:0%
no
okay

00:11:57.710 --> 00:11:57.720 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:11:57.720 --> 00:11:58.370 align:start position:0%
okay
um

00:11:58.370 --> 00:11:58.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:03.769 --> 00:12:03.779 align:start position:0%
since we last met two weeks ago we were
 
00:12:05.750 --> 00:12:05.760 align:start position:0%
not permitted by the speaker to meet
 
00:12:08.509 --> 00:12:08.519 align:start position:0%
last week because during Committee of
 
00:12:12.470 --> 00:12:12.480 align:start position:0%
conference week there are so many things
 
00:12:17.150 --> 00:12:17.160 align:start position:0%
going on the staff is is so involved and
 
00:12:19.370 --> 00:12:19.380 align:start position:0%
even the committee rooms
 
00:12:22.370 --> 00:12:22.380 align:start position:0%
are involved so that regular committees
 
00:12:24.829 --> 00:12:24.839 align:start position:0%
can or special committees cannot meet
 
00:12:29.750 --> 00:12:29.760 align:start position:0%
during that week and so we did meet
 
00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:30.829 align:start position:0%
during that week and so we did meet
um

00:12:30.829 --> 00:12:30.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:30.839 --> 00:12:32.269 align:start position:0%
um
uh

00:12:32.269 --> 00:12:32.279 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:12:34.069 --> 00:12:34.079 align:start position:0%
uh we did not have a committee meeting
 
00:12:36.650 --> 00:12:36.660 align:start position:0%
but those of us who had scheduling
 
00:12:39.710 --> 00:12:39.720 align:start position:0%
flexibilities were some of us were able
 
00:12:40.810 --> 00:12:40.820 align:start position:0%
to visit
 
00:12:43.910 --> 00:12:43.920 align:start position:0%
family courts in three different
 
00:12:49.069 --> 00:12:49.079 align:start position:0%
locations Nashua Concord and Laconia and
 
00:12:52.069 --> 00:12:52.079 align:start position:0%
I believe everyone found the visits to
 
00:12:53.629 --> 00:12:53.639 align:start position:0%
be instructive
 
00:12:57.730 --> 00:12:57.740 align:start position:0%
um and it is always helpful to see
 
00:13:00.110 --> 00:13:00.120 align:start position:0%
for ourselves what
 
00:13:02.449 --> 00:13:02.459 align:start position:0%
the physical facilities look like what
 
00:13:04.310 --> 00:13:04.320 align:start position:0%
the tone is
 
00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:05.030 align:start position:0%
the tone is
um

00:13:05.030 --> 00:13:05.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:08.750 --> 00:13:08.760 align:start position:0%
and and we all observed
 
00:13:11.090 --> 00:13:11.100 align:start position:0%
any number of cases some of us as many
 
00:13:13.430 --> 00:13:13.440 align:start position:0%
as five or six some of us two or three
 
00:13:16.790 --> 00:13:16.800 align:start position:0%
but I think everybody found that to be
 
00:13:19.129 --> 00:13:19.139 align:start position:0%
quite instructive
 
00:13:19.139 --> 00:13:20.269 align:start position:0%
quite instructive
um

00:13:20.269 --> 00:13:20.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:22.970 --> 00:13:22.980 align:start position:0%
so here we are now
 
00:13:26.629 --> 00:13:26.639 align:start position:0%
um and the task before us today is to
 
00:13:28.870 --> 00:13:28.880 align:start position:0%
try to determine
 
00:13:32.030 --> 00:13:32.040 align:start position:0%
where and we would like
 
00:13:35.990 --> 00:13:36.000 align:start position:0%
to spend our energies over the next
 
00:13:39.590 --> 00:13:39.600 align:start position:0%
couple of months individually
 
00:13:41.690 --> 00:13:41.700 align:start position:0%
um or perhaps a couple of people from in
 
00:13:44.629 --> 00:13:44.639 align:start position:0%
the committee working together but never
 
00:13:46.370 --> 00:13:46.380 align:start position:0%
more than that
 
00:13:46.380 --> 00:13:46.970 align:start position:0%
more than that
um

00:13:46.970 --> 00:13:46.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:51.590 --> 00:13:51.600 align:start position:0%
because all our work uh is done under
 
00:13:53.930 --> 00:13:53.940 align:start position:0%
right to know so that
 
00:13:55.970 --> 00:13:55.980 align:start position:0%
um you know the full committee would
 
00:13:57.350 --> 00:13:57.360 align:start position:0%
never meet
 
00:13:59.090 --> 00:13:59.100 align:start position:0%
um or even the subcommittee would never
 
00:14:03.650 --> 00:14:03.660 align:start position:0%
meet in any venue that wasn't posted in
 
00:14:04.690 --> 00:14:04.700 align:start position:0%
the calendar
 
00:14:08.329 --> 00:14:08.339 align:start position:0%
but there is a lot of research that we
 
00:14:10.310 --> 00:14:10.320 align:start position:0%
want to do in a lot of areas we want to
 
00:14:14.449 --> 00:14:14.459 align:start position:0%
pursue and so I would like to know from
 
00:14:16.850 --> 00:14:16.860 align:start position:0%
my colleagues what they're thinking
 
00:14:16.860 --> 00:14:18.490 align:start position:0%
my colleagues what they're thinking
about

00:14:18.490 --> 00:14:18.500 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:14:20.569 --> 00:14:20.579 align:start position:0%
representative Greg
 
00:14:22.970 --> 00:14:22.980 align:start position:0%
so what you're asking what we would like
 
00:14:24.949 --> 00:14:24.959 align:start position:0%
to focus on to work on each individual
 
00:14:28.610 --> 00:14:28.620 align:start position:0%
so I the gal is a big thing for me the
 
00:14:30.470 --> 00:14:30.480 align:start position:0%
guardian ad litem I think that we have
 
00:14:32.509 --> 00:14:32.519 align:start position:0%
some work we can definitely do within
 
00:14:34.190 --> 00:14:34.200 align:start position:0%
that space and I'd like to look further
 
00:14:35.290 --> 00:14:35.300 align:start position:0%
into that
 
00:14:37.610 --> 00:14:37.620 align:start position:0%
is there something that you want do you
 
00:14:40.129 --> 00:14:40.139 align:start position:0%
want to develop that idea now or do you
 
00:14:42.290 --> 00:14:42.300 align:start position:0%
want to wait and
 
00:14:43.910 --> 00:14:43.920 align:start position:0%
wait well I think
 
00:14:43.920 --> 00:14:44.509 align:start position:0%
wait well I think
um

00:14:44.509 --> 00:14:44.519 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:47.329 --> 00:14:47.339 align:start position:0%
I think while you know there's a couple
 
00:14:49.490 --> 00:14:49.500 align:start position:0%
things that it's you know that we don't
 
00:14:51.829 --> 00:14:51.839 align:start position:0%
fund it anymore so that people you know
 
00:14:55.129 --> 00:14:55.139 align:start position:0%
who have need to do it cannot get it you
 
00:14:56.689 --> 00:14:56.699 align:start position:0%
know it's only for people who can afford
 
00:14:58.430 --> 00:14:58.440 align:start position:0%
it which sets up kind of an unfair
 
00:15:01.009 --> 00:15:01.019 align:start position:0%
system in that but also just looking at
 
00:15:05.150 --> 00:15:05.160 align:start position:0%
the gala as far as you know what their
 
00:15:06.769 --> 00:15:06.779 align:start position:0%
you know they're not supposed to be
 
00:15:08.689 --> 00:15:08.699 align:start position:0%
giving recommendations right now and
 
00:15:11.090 --> 00:15:11.100 align:start position:0%
they are lawyers I would like to see you
 
00:15:12.470 --> 00:15:12.480 align:start position:0%
know I've seen in other states where
 
00:15:14.750 --> 00:15:14.760 align:start position:0%
they expand that to have people with you
 
00:15:17.389 --> 00:15:17.399 align:start position:0%
know psychological you know degrees and
 
00:15:19.250 --> 00:15:19.260 align:start position:0%
backgrounds that are able to really look
 
00:15:21.110 --> 00:15:21.120 align:start position:0%
at situations especially when we get
 
00:15:22.970 --> 00:15:22.980 align:start position:0%
into like domestic violence situations
 
00:15:25.730 --> 00:15:25.740 align:start position:0%
and be able to be a little bit more
 
00:15:27.650 --> 00:15:27.660 align:start position:0%
knowledgeable as far as to all the
 
00:15:28.970 --> 00:15:28.980 align:start position:0%
psychology that goes into those
 
00:15:30.829 --> 00:15:30.839 align:start position:0%
situations so I'd like to see if there's
 
00:15:33.170 --> 00:15:33.180 align:start position:0%
something we can you know tweak within
 
00:15:34.970 --> 00:15:34.980 align:start position:0%
that to help the situation because I
 
00:15:37.069 --> 00:15:37.079 align:start position:0%
think you know a lot of times it seems
 
00:15:38.990 --> 00:15:39.000 align:start position:0%
to be what we're looking at in these
 
00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:40.970 align:start position:0%
to be what we're looking at in these
situations

00:15:40.970 --> 00:15:40.980 align:start position:0%
situations
 
00:15:43.610 --> 00:15:43.620 align:start position:0%
thank you representative GAO certainly
 
00:15:48.590 --> 00:15:48.600 align:start position:0%
has been an issue that has come up in a
 
00:15:51.590 --> 00:15:51.600 align:start position:0%
number of different Avenues does anybody
 
00:15:56.449 --> 00:15:56.459 align:start position:0%
else have any feelings about that yes
 
00:15:56.459 --> 00:15:59.350 align:start position:0%
else have any feelings about that yes
foreign

00:15:59.350 --> 00:15:59.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:04.449 --> 00:16:04.459 align:start position:0%
thank you uh chairwoman so
 
00:16:07.490 --> 00:16:07.500 align:start position:0%
I agree that there you know the gal
 
00:16:09.350 --> 00:16:09.360 align:start position:0%
issue does need to be looked into I
 
00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:10.850 align:start position:0%
issue does need to be looked into I
think

00:16:10.850 --> 00:16:10.860 align:start position:0%
think
 
00:16:13.189 --> 00:16:13.199 align:start position:0%
we should expand it perhaps or consider
 
00:16:15.710 --> 00:16:15.720 align:start position:0%
expanding it also into
 
00:16:19.370 --> 00:16:19.380 align:start position:0%
making sure that the qualifications of
 
00:16:21.290 --> 00:16:21.300 align:start position:0%
the gals are really there and that there
 
00:16:23.650 --> 00:16:23.660 align:start position:0%
is some sort of training to not have
 
00:16:26.449 --> 00:16:26.459 align:start position:0%
bias like everybody inherently is going
 
00:16:29.389 --> 00:16:29.399 align:start position:0%
to have some sort of bias either way and
 
00:16:31.730 --> 00:16:31.740 align:start position:0%
we want to make sure that if gals are
 
00:16:33.410 --> 00:16:33.420 align:start position:0%
going to be looking into cases like this
 
00:16:35.629 --> 00:16:35.639 align:start position:0%
that you know we've heard lots of
 
00:16:37.430 --> 00:16:37.440 align:start position:0%
testimony about
 
00:16:40.310 --> 00:16:40.320 align:start position:0%
you know people feeling that the gals
 
00:16:43.009 --> 00:16:43.019 align:start position:0%
were unfair and I think in order to
 
00:16:45.230 --> 00:16:45.240 align:start position:0%
you know mitigate that there needs to be
 
00:16:47.689 --> 00:16:47.699 align:start position:0%
some sort of guidelines and training if
 
00:16:49.490 --> 00:16:49.500 align:start position:0%
we're going to involve gals more to make
 
00:16:51.530 --> 00:16:51.540 align:start position:0%
sure that they're not going to be just
 
00:16:53.329 --> 00:16:53.339 align:start position:0%
coming in and we're using them more and
 
00:16:54.889 --> 00:16:54.899 align:start position:0%
we're having more and more people feel
 
00:16:58.189 --> 00:16:58.199 align:start position:0%
that there was a bias against them
 
00:17:00.170 --> 00:17:00.180 align:start position:0%
um and I'm not sure exactly how we do
 
00:17:01.850 --> 00:17:01.860 align:start position:0%
that I do
 
00:17:04.669 --> 00:17:04.679 align:start position:0%
have a little bit of a concern with
 
00:17:04.679 --> 00:17:05.590 align:start position:0%
have a little bit of a concern with
um

00:17:05.590 --> 00:17:05.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:17:09.350 --> 00:17:09.360 align:start position:0%
as well with the gals that in the
 
00:17:10.970 --> 00:17:10.980 align:start position:0%
majority of the cases that I saw when a
 
00:17:13.010 --> 00:17:13.020 align:start position:0%
gal was hired they were ordering a
 
00:17:16.250 --> 00:17:16.260 align:start position:0%
mental health evaluation and to me that
 
00:17:19.309 --> 00:17:19.319 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be the standard of care so to
 
00:17:20.809 --> 00:17:20.819 align:start position:0%
speak that we're automatically ordering
 
00:17:23.030 --> 00:17:23.040 align:start position:0%
a mental health evaluation yes parents
 
00:17:24.289 --> 00:17:24.299 align:start position:0%
are coming in they're emotional about
 
00:17:26.030 --> 00:17:26.040 align:start position:0%
their children of course they are it's
 
00:17:27.949 --> 00:17:27.959 align:start position:0%
their kids their babies but that doesn't
 
00:17:30.950 --> 00:17:30.960 align:start position:0%
mean that they're mentally ill and it I
 
00:17:32.870 --> 00:17:32.880 align:start position:0%
feel like there's this presumption that
 
00:17:35.210 --> 00:17:35.220 align:start position:0%
we need to rule out if they are or are
 
00:17:37.070 --> 00:17:37.080 align:start position:0%
not mentally ill and I just those are
 
00:17:39.590 --> 00:17:39.600 align:start position:0%
expensive evaluations that that people
 
00:17:41.270 --> 00:17:41.280 align:start position:0%
are subject to and when you think about
 
00:17:43.010 --> 00:17:43.020 align:start position:0%
it you know when I was looking through
 
00:17:44.990 --> 00:17:45.000 align:start position:0%
some of the data because it's not
 
00:17:46.610 --> 00:17:46.620 align:start position:0%
medically necessary it's not covered by
 
00:17:47.990 --> 00:17:48.000 align:start position:0%
health insurance people are paying for
 
00:17:51.590 --> 00:17:51.600 align:start position:0%
these out of their own pockets and it's
 
00:17:53.150 --> 00:17:53.160 align:start position:0%
like at an expensive four thousand
 
00:17:55.250 --> 00:17:55.260 align:start position:0%
dollars when you consider that there's a
 
00:17:56.570 --> 00:17:56.580 align:start position:0%
decent amount of people that only make
 
00:17:58.610 --> 00:17:58.620 align:start position:0%
forty thousand dollars a year that's ten
 
00:18:00.409 --> 00:18:00.419 align:start position:0%
percent of their yearly salary to pay
 
00:18:03.950 --> 00:18:03.960 align:start position:0%
for this mental health evaluation that's
 
00:18:06.770 --> 00:18:06.780 align:start position:0%
very much so probably unnecessary you
 
00:18:09.010 --> 00:18:09.020 align:start position:0%
know unless there's an actual evidence
 
00:18:11.090 --> 00:18:11.100 align:start position:0%
presented I don't think that that should
 
00:18:12.950 --> 00:18:12.960 align:start position:0%
be a standard that's just ordered we're
 
00:18:14.029 --> 00:18:14.039 align:start position:0%
going to order this mental health
 
00:18:16.070 --> 00:18:16.080 align:start position:0%
evaluation to rule it out unless there's
 
00:18:19.250 --> 00:18:19.260 align:start position:0%
actual evidence that somebody has
 
00:18:21.049 --> 00:18:21.059 align:start position:0%
some sort of issue that needs to be
 
00:18:23.750 --> 00:18:23.760 align:start position:0%
further explored I just I do have great
 
00:18:26.750 --> 00:18:26.760 align:start position:0%
concern about that area of it as well
 
00:18:28.510 --> 00:18:28.520 align:start position:0%
not sure your thoughts on that
 
00:18:31.130 --> 00:18:31.140 align:start position:0%
representative if I could just for a
 
00:18:33.049 --> 00:18:33.059 align:start position:0%
moment representative McBeth we're
 
00:18:37.130 --> 00:18:37.140 align:start position:0%
starting by talking about areas that we
 
00:18:40.210 --> 00:18:40.220 align:start position:0%
think we would like to focus some energy
 
00:18:44.630 --> 00:18:44.640 align:start position:0%
over the next focused uh energy over the
 
00:18:47.450 --> 00:18:47.460 align:start position:0%
next few months trying to go through the
 
00:18:50.870 --> 00:18:50.880 align:start position:0%
the Myriad documents that we have and
 
00:18:53.570 --> 00:18:53.580 align:start position:0%
figure out ways that we might help
 
00:18:53.580 --> 00:18:55.850 align:start position:0%
figure out ways that we might help
um

00:18:55.850 --> 00:18:55.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:58.070 --> 00:18:58.080 align:start position:0%
make sure that we have the best possible
 
00:18:59.930 --> 00:18:59.940 align:start position:0%
system and that's what we're talking
 
00:19:04.130 --> 00:19:04.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:06.590 --> 00:19:06.600 align:start position:0%
hi thank you I guess people didn't hear
 
00:19:07.970 --> 00:19:07.980 align:start position:0%
me earlier with what I was saying
 
00:19:09.350 --> 00:19:09.360 align:start position:0%
because I was talking sideways sorry
 
00:19:12.350 --> 00:19:12.360 align:start position:0%
learning curve so what I was saying is
 
00:19:13.970 --> 00:19:13.980 align:start position:0%
is I would like to say this and then
 
00:19:16.310 --> 00:19:16.320 align:start position:0%
I'll respond to um
 
00:19:19.909 --> 00:19:19.919 align:start position:0%
to my colleague but that I on the gal
 
00:19:21.770 --> 00:19:21.780 align:start position:0%
system I'd like to look into that
 
00:19:23.150 --> 00:19:23.160 align:start position:0%
because I know there's other states
 
00:19:25.730 --> 00:19:25.740 align:start position:0%
where they employ rather than just
 
00:19:27.710 --> 00:19:27.720 align:start position:0%
lawyers or people with legal backgrounds
 
00:19:28.970 --> 00:19:28.980 align:start position:0%
people that have psychological
 
00:19:31.130 --> 00:19:31.140 align:start position:0%
backgrounds to do this kind of work so
 
00:19:33.409 --> 00:19:33.419 align:start position:0%
that the complications of domestic
 
00:19:35.990 --> 00:19:36.000 align:start position:0%
violence and stuff are a little
 
00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:36.710 align:start position:0%
violence and stuff are a little
um

00:19:36.710 --> 00:19:36.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:39.770 --> 00:19:39.780 align:start position:0%
you know it's not so uh obscure or
 
00:19:41.330 --> 00:19:41.340 align:start position:0%
whatever they can actually they have a
 
00:19:42.710 --> 00:19:42.720 align:start position:0%
background they have knowledge to what
 
00:19:44.810 --> 00:19:44.820 align:start position:0%
this looks like because there's many
 
00:19:48.470 --> 00:19:48.480 align:start position:0%
times when you know it it could be the
 
00:19:50.750 --> 00:19:50.760 align:start position:0%
actual abuser claiming to be a victim
 
00:19:52.070 --> 00:19:52.080 align:start position:0%
and stuff there's a lot of complications
 
00:19:55.909 --> 00:19:55.919 align:start position:0%
when it comes to domestic violence so um
 
00:19:57.590 --> 00:19:57.600 align:start position:0%
as to what
 
00:19:58.970 --> 00:19:58.980 align:start position:0%
you know ordering mental health
 
00:20:01.010 --> 00:20:01.020 align:start position:0%
evaluations I think that's part of kind
 
00:20:02.690 --> 00:20:02.700 align:start position:0%
of goes into this that's one of those
 
00:20:04.310 --> 00:20:04.320 align:start position:0%
things I don't think it's necessarily
 
00:20:06.710 --> 00:20:06.720 align:start position:0%
that they're always in the cases that I
 
00:20:09.110 --> 00:20:09.120 align:start position:0%
looked at uh doing it because they think
 
00:20:10.970 --> 00:20:10.980 align:start position:0%
somebody's mentally ill it's that
 
00:20:12.230 --> 00:20:12.240 align:start position:0%
they're trying to understand a
 
00:20:14.450 --> 00:20:14.460 align:start position:0%
background I know a lot of when there
 
00:20:15.950 --> 00:20:15.960 align:start position:0%
are domestic violence and there's a
 
00:20:17.570 --> 00:20:17.580 align:start position:0%
parental rights evaluation or whatever
 
00:20:19.789 --> 00:20:19.799 align:start position:0%
they'll look at they'll do like an
 
00:20:21.710 --> 00:20:21.720 align:start position:0%
evaluation of both parents because
 
00:20:24.169 --> 00:20:24.179 align:start position:0%
that's kind of how you work to tell not
 
00:20:28.130 --> 00:20:28.140 align:start position:0%
if somebody's mentally ill but if what
 
00:20:30.169 --> 00:20:30.179 align:start position:0%
the underlying issues are so that they
 
00:20:31.850 --> 00:20:31.860 align:start position:0%
can best evaluate like what's going on
 
00:20:34.070 --> 00:20:34.080 align:start position:0%
with the kids and stuff but once again I
 
00:20:34.080 --> 00:20:34.909 align:start position:0%
with the kids and stuff but once again I
think

00:20:34.909 --> 00:20:34.919 align:start position:0%
think
 
00:20:37.450 --> 00:20:37.460 align:start position:0%
that's one of those things with this gal
 
00:20:40.970 --> 00:20:40.980 align:start position:0%
that's a little more specific than what
 
00:20:43.310 --> 00:20:43.320 align:start position:0%
they're really necessarily designed to
 
00:20:45.950 --> 00:20:45.960 align:start position:0%
do at this time so I do agree that
 
00:20:47.630 --> 00:20:47.640 align:start position:0%
that's something that we kind of need to
 
00:20:49.730 --> 00:20:49.740 align:start position:0%
look into as to how they're doing that
 
00:20:51.230 --> 00:20:51.240 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Macbeth I don't
 
00:20:53.210 --> 00:20:53.220 align:start position:0%
want to put you on the spot and you can
 
00:20:56.270 --> 00:20:56.280 align:start position:0%
say no but I um
 
00:20:58.970 --> 00:20:58.980 align:start position:0%
um I seem to recall that you have given
 
00:21:01.250 --> 00:21:01.260 align:start position:0%
us the clearest
 
00:21:01.260 --> 00:21:01.909 align:start position:0%
us the clearest
um

00:21:01.909 --> 00:21:01.919 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:04.690 --> 00:21:04.700 align:start position:0%
uh definition of the two different
 
00:21:08.029 --> 00:21:08.039 align:start position:0%
tracts of gal
 
00:21:10.610 --> 00:21:10.620 align:start position:0%
um that exist in the state
 
00:21:13.909 --> 00:21:13.919 align:start position:0%
um is that something that
 
00:21:16.250 --> 00:21:16.260 align:start position:0%
you're prepared to share with us now or
 
00:21:18.529 --> 00:21:18.539 align:start position:0%
would you rather not
 
00:21:20.630 --> 00:21:20.640 align:start position:0%
thank you and I would like to just
 
00:21:24.110 --> 00:21:24.120 align:start position:0%
mention I think that I think the gal
 
00:21:27.470 --> 00:21:27.480 align:start position:0%
process what I think what thank you what
 
00:21:29.149 --> 00:21:29.159 align:start position:0%
representative Smith is talking about is
 
00:21:30.950 --> 00:21:30.960 align:start position:0%
the different tracks between the
 
00:21:32.690 --> 00:21:32.700 align:start position:0%
guardian of the items that are certified
 
00:21:37.029 --> 00:21:37.039 align:start position:0%
through the licensure office office of
 
00:21:41.830 --> 00:21:41.840 align:start position:0%
licensure and the gals that are Casa
 
00:21:45.169 --> 00:21:45.179 align:start position:0%
volunteers so I don't know much about
 
00:21:47.630 --> 00:21:47.640 align:start position:0%
the casa volunteers prior to about 10
 
00:21:50.450 --> 00:21:50.460 align:start position:0%
years ago the majority of the Guardian
 
00:21:52.130 --> 00:21:52.140 align:start position:0%
ad items in New Hampshire were those
 
00:21:53.690 --> 00:21:53.700 align:start position:0%
ones certified by the state going
 
00:21:56.210 --> 00:21:56.220 align:start position:0%
through that training and um and I
 
00:21:58.909 --> 00:21:58.919 align:start position:0%
understand there is a connection between
 
00:22:01.669 --> 00:22:01.679 align:start position:0%
the two and some separations as far as
 
00:22:04.370 --> 00:22:04.380 align:start position:0%
how they're disciplined or but anyway
 
00:22:06.250 --> 00:22:06.260 align:start position:0%
um but when the state stopped funding
 
00:22:10.370 --> 00:22:10.380 align:start position:0%
Guardian ad items for family cases where
 
00:22:13.549 --> 00:22:13.559 align:start position:0%
the clients were at some percentage of
 
00:22:15.529 --> 00:22:15.539 align:start position:0%
poverty level or whatever that's when
 
00:22:18.049 --> 00:22:18.059 align:start position:0%
the state then relied much more heavily
 
00:22:21.130 --> 00:22:21.140 align:start position:0%
and there was the this more you know and
 
00:22:24.710 --> 00:22:24.720 align:start position:0%
more leaning on the volunteer causes the
 
00:22:27.110 --> 00:22:27.120 align:start position:0%
um and uh what are they like children
 
00:22:29.750 --> 00:22:29.760 align:start position:0%
their children Advocates I do see some
 
00:22:31.669 --> 00:22:31.679 align:start position:0%
differences in the groups and I I want
 
00:22:33.890 --> 00:22:33.900 align:start position:0%
to become more educated about that but I
 
00:22:35.510 --> 00:22:35.520 align:start position:0%
know as a guardian ad litem and I'm one
 
00:22:37.669 --> 00:22:37.679 align:start position:0%
certified by the state and in the family
 
00:22:39.230 --> 00:22:39.240 align:start position:0%
court and the superior court and Probate
 
00:22:42.470 --> 00:22:42.480 align:start position:0%
Court my job my role is a fact finder
 
00:22:44.390 --> 00:22:44.400 align:start position:0%
for the court
 
00:22:46.669 --> 00:22:46.679 align:start position:0%
um I know that I hear when Casa
 
00:22:49.130 --> 00:22:49.140 align:start position:0%
volunteers talk about their role they're
 
00:22:51.289 --> 00:22:51.299 align:start position:0%
a voice for the child so there's a
 
00:22:53.630 --> 00:22:53.640 align:start position:0%
little bit difference in that and I'm
 
00:22:55.430 --> 00:22:55.440 align:start position:0%
not sure how much they co-mingle and if
 
00:22:57.529 --> 00:22:57.539 align:start position:0%
our language is just different but I
 
00:23:00.830 --> 00:23:00.840 align:start position:0%
know that um of course the the miners
 
00:23:00.840 --> 00:23:01.970 align:start position:0%
know that um of course the the miners
um

00:23:01.970 --> 00:23:01.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:04.310 --> 00:23:04.320 align:start position:0%
welfare and best interest is both of
 
00:23:06.409 --> 00:23:06.419 align:start position:0%
ours number one concern but depending on
 
00:23:08.510 --> 00:23:08.520 align:start position:0%
the age of the child and also some of
 
00:23:10.310 --> 00:23:10.320 align:start position:0%
the psychological why they may if they
 
00:23:11.810 --> 00:23:11.820 align:start position:0%
may be influenced to say one thing or
 
00:23:14.149 --> 00:23:14.159 align:start position:0%
another their opinion while if it's
 
00:23:15.649 --> 00:23:15.659 align:start position:0%
obtained it's generally shared with the
 
00:23:19.490 --> 00:23:19.500 align:start position:0%
court it's not the end all you know I
 
00:23:20.750 --> 00:23:20.760 align:start position:0%
just want to say
 
00:23:22.430 --> 00:23:22.440 align:start position:0%
um and I'm interested in some of the
 
00:23:24.169 --> 00:23:24.179 align:start position:0%
documentation that uh representative
 
00:23:25.850 --> 00:23:25.860 align:start position:0%
data that you've looked at could talk
 
00:23:28.490 --> 00:23:28.500 align:start position:0%
about the mental health evaluations
 
00:23:30.890 --> 00:23:30.900 align:start position:0%
um my experiences when you get an
 
00:23:32.390 --> 00:23:32.400 align:start position:0%
appointment to be a guardian of the
 
00:23:35.210 --> 00:23:35.220 align:start position:0%
Litem the judge has to court has signs
 
00:23:38.149 --> 00:23:38.159 align:start position:0%
off and checks very specifically what if
 
00:23:40.070 --> 00:23:40.080 align:start position:0%
you're a guardian ad litem and I believe
 
00:23:42.169 --> 00:23:42.179 align:start position:0%
it's for Casa as well what you can look
 
00:23:45.350 --> 00:23:45.360 align:start position:0%
at so my appointment I can only address
 
00:23:47.750 --> 00:23:47.760 align:start position:0%
or I'm to only address those issues that
 
00:23:51.049 --> 00:23:51.059 align:start position:0%
the court has checked off and in my you
 
00:23:52.490 --> 00:23:52.500 align:start position:0%
know again we're talking I don't know
 
00:23:53.870 --> 00:23:53.880 align:start position:0%
what the percentage is but only a small
 
00:23:56.029 --> 00:23:56.039 align:start position:0%
percentage of marital cases have
 
00:23:58.430 --> 00:23:58.440 align:start position:0%
guardianed items or I I don't know if
 
00:23:59.630 --> 00:23:59.640 align:start position:0%
you know what it is I don't but I know
 
00:24:01.909 --> 00:24:01.919 align:start position:0%
it's not the majority and they're also
 
00:24:03.830 --> 00:24:03.840 align:start position:0%
so when I get them they're very usually
 
00:24:05.690 --> 00:24:05.700 align:start position:0%
very difficult cases that have gone on
 
00:24:07.789 --> 00:24:07.799 align:start position:0%
for a long time and I wouldn't I would
 
00:24:09.890 --> 00:24:09.900 align:start position:0%
say just maybe in half of those does the
 
00:24:12.169 --> 00:24:12.179 align:start position:0%
court suggest that I make a
 
00:24:13.490 --> 00:24:13.500 align:start position:0%
recommendation or look into the
 
00:24:14.990 --> 00:24:15.000 align:start position:0%
possibility of whether a psychological
 
00:24:17.930 --> 00:24:17.940 align:start position:0%
evaluation was important they are very
 
00:24:20.090 --> 00:24:20.100 align:start position:0%
expensive and sometimes people can't get
 
00:24:21.890 --> 00:24:21.900 align:start position:0%
them because they're not indicated and I
 
00:24:22.909 --> 00:24:22.919 align:start position:0%
think that's something we need to talk
 
00:24:25.130 --> 00:24:25.140 align:start position:0%
about Judges if they are
 
00:24:27.230 --> 00:24:27.240 align:start position:0%
um you know but if if they are checked
 
00:24:29.090 --> 00:24:29.100 align:start position:0%
off on that form and I'd like to know
 
00:24:30.649 --> 00:24:30.659 align:start position:0%
how frequently they are because my
 
00:24:33.409 --> 00:24:33.419 align:start position:0%
experience my experience which is just
 
00:24:36.710 --> 00:24:36.720 align:start position:0%
me is that they're not rarely checked
 
00:24:38.210 --> 00:24:38.220 align:start position:0%
off and even if I have some background
 
00:24:40.549 --> 00:24:40.559 align:start position:0%
the the judge always you know does not
 
00:24:42.289 --> 00:24:42.299 align:start position:0%
is free not to take my recommendations
 
00:24:44.690 --> 00:24:44.700 align:start position:0%
or my my you know I don't again I'm
 
00:24:46.370 --> 00:24:46.380 align:start position:0%
supposed to be a fact finder so I list
 
00:24:48.590 --> 00:24:48.600 align:start position:0%
facts why it might be appropriate for
 
00:24:50.270 --> 00:24:50.280 align:start position:0%
the court to recommend this I generally
 
00:24:52.610 --> 00:24:52.620 align:start position:0%
don't say this parent needs one if
 
00:24:54.169 --> 00:24:54.179 align:start position:0%
that's what the court and then the court
 
00:24:55.669 --> 00:24:55.679 align:start position:0%
weighs that
 
00:24:59.029 --> 00:24:59.039 align:start position:0%
um but uh I think the other issue is
 
00:25:01.130 --> 00:25:01.140 align:start position:0%
someone you know mental illness is a
 
00:25:03.049 --> 00:25:03.059 align:start position:0%
pretty big umbrella and I think that
 
00:25:06.169 --> 00:25:06.179 align:start position:0%
having that evaluation is critical for
 
00:25:07.850 --> 00:25:07.860 align:start position:0%
the background it doesn't mean that
 
00:25:09.590 --> 00:25:09.600 align:start position:0%
you're you can't be a parent it just
 
00:25:11.990 --> 00:25:12.000 align:start position:0%
means are you being treated and um
 
00:25:13.789 --> 00:25:13.799 align:start position:0%
because I think the majority I don't
 
00:25:14.870 --> 00:25:14.880 align:start position:0%
know I would
 
00:25:16.430 --> 00:25:16.440 align:start position:0%
certainly in my family more than half
 
00:25:19.310 --> 00:25:19.320 align:start position:0%
people have mental illnesses so at one
 
00:25:20.810 --> 00:25:20.820 align:start position:0%
time or another so I don't think that's
 
00:25:22.549 --> 00:25:22.559 align:start position:0%
a I think what we're looking for is not
 
00:25:24.169 --> 00:25:24.179 align:start position:0%
necessarily A Mental Illness but maybe
 
00:25:26.390 --> 00:25:26.400 align:start position:0%
some I mean that as well but I think
 
00:25:27.890 --> 00:25:27.900 align:start position:0%
it's a broader just terms the
 
00:25:29.630 --> 00:25:29.640 align:start position:0%
psychological makeup that might be
 
00:25:31.669 --> 00:25:31.679 align:start position:0%
causing some reactivity or conflict or
 
00:25:33.830 --> 00:25:33.840 align:start position:0%
something like that but I just I guess I
 
00:25:36.230 --> 00:25:36.240 align:start position:0%
just want to just put that in my my
 
00:25:39.230 --> 00:25:39.240 align:start position:0%
experience that someone having a label
 
00:25:40.669 --> 00:25:40.679 align:start position:0%
of a mental illness which can be
 
00:25:43.190 --> 00:25:43.200 align:start position:0%
depression add I mean I'm taking all
 
00:25:44.510 --> 00:25:44.520 align:start position:0%
that stuff
 
00:25:47.210 --> 00:25:47.220 align:start position:0%
um that doesn't preclude you from being
 
00:25:49.909 --> 00:25:49.919 align:start position:0%
um uh you know having parenting rights
 
00:25:52.789 --> 00:25:52.799 align:start position:0%
in my experience if it's an untreated
 
00:25:54.649 --> 00:25:54.659 align:start position:0%
um you know if you have a some type of
 
00:25:56.630 --> 00:25:56.640 align:start position:0%
schizophrenia something that's untreated
 
00:25:58.430 --> 00:25:58.440 align:start position:0%
or even add maybe that's untreated and
 
00:25:59.570 --> 00:25:59.580 align:start position:0%
you never show up for parenting or
 
00:26:00.830 --> 00:26:00.840 align:start position:0%
whatever I'm not saying but I think
 
00:26:02.210 --> 00:26:02.220 align:start position:0%
that's what the court is looking like is
 
00:26:04.190 --> 00:26:04.200 align:start position:0%
this person following through on the
 
00:26:05.510 --> 00:26:05.520 align:start position:0%
treatment plan you know are they going
 
00:26:07.549 --> 00:26:07.559 align:start position:0%
to appointments that type of stuff so I
 
00:26:09.710 --> 00:26:09.720 align:start position:0%
just don't want to give mental illness a
 
00:26:13.730 --> 00:26:13.740 align:start position:0%
kind of a bad name and um but um I I
 
00:26:15.830 --> 00:26:15.840 align:start position:0%
again and I'm sorry to come in late and
 
00:26:18.110 --> 00:26:18.120 align:start position:0%
then but I I would really like more
 
00:26:19.789 --> 00:26:19.799 align:start position:0%
education and I think
 
00:26:21.470 --> 00:26:21.480 align:start position:0%
um parents need more education in the
 
00:26:23.510 --> 00:26:23.520 align:start position:0%
courts on these two different tracks of
 
00:26:23.520 --> 00:26:25.810 align:start position:0%
courts on these two different tracks of
of

00:26:25.810 --> 00:26:25.820 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:26:28.250 --> 00:26:28.260 align:start position:0%
gals and I I think they're really we
 
00:26:30.350 --> 00:26:30.360 align:start position:0%
should have the same type platform and
 
00:26:33.230 --> 00:26:33.240 align:start position:0%
Education and Training and also
 
00:26:34.909 --> 00:26:34.919 align:start position:0%
expectations of what we're going to
 
00:26:36.950 --> 00:26:36.960 align:start position:0%
provide to the court and I'm I'm not
 
00:26:38.390 --> 00:26:38.400 align:start position:0%
clear that that's always true and I
 
00:26:39.769 --> 00:26:39.779 align:start position:0%
think that would be critical to give
 
00:26:43.250 --> 00:26:43.260 align:start position:0%
families a more transparent and
 
00:26:46.430 --> 00:26:46.440 align:start position:0%
consistent experience
 
00:26:49.310 --> 00:26:49.320 align:start position:0%
um because when again I I see there is a
 
00:26:51.890 --> 00:26:51.900 align:start position:0%
dichotomy in my limited space and not
 
00:26:53.750 --> 00:26:53.760 align:start position:0%
better or worse different and I think
 
00:26:53.760 --> 00:26:54.950 align:start position:0%
better or worse different and I think
that

00:26:54.950 --> 00:26:54.960 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:26:56.990 --> 00:26:57.000 align:start position:0%
um then makes the experience different
 
00:26:59.990 --> 00:27:00.000 align:start position:0%
and again I think the big thing about
 
00:27:01.909 --> 00:27:01.919 align:start position:0%
Family Court is managing expectations
 
00:27:03.890 --> 00:27:03.900 align:start position:0%
and if people have an expectation of
 
00:27:05.570 --> 00:27:05.580 align:start position:0%
their attorney or the judge or the gal
 
00:27:08.750 --> 00:27:08.760 align:start position:0%
and it's you know it's not what's
 
00:27:11.269 --> 00:27:11.279 align:start position:0%
happening I I what I've heard from the
 
00:27:13.130 --> 00:27:13.140 align:start position:0%
testimony that's generally what causes a
 
00:27:14.750 --> 00:27:14.760 align:start position:0%
lot of problems people are expecting one
 
00:27:17.870 --> 00:27:17.880 align:start position:0%
thing and yet another or so I I do agree
 
00:27:20.390 --> 00:27:20.400 align:start position:0%
I think this is something to look at I
 
00:27:22.610 --> 00:27:22.620 align:start position:0%
I also the issue of I don't know if
 
00:27:24.110 --> 00:27:24.120 align:start position:0%
you've mentioned it but the issue of one
 
00:27:26.510 --> 00:27:26.520 align:start position:0%
parent paying and the other one not
 
00:27:29.090 --> 00:27:29.100 align:start position:0%
um that that's an issue I I mean I I'm
 
00:27:31.430 --> 00:27:31.440 align:start position:0%
not sure why but State decided to stop
 
00:27:34.250 --> 00:27:34.260 align:start position:0%
funding these in the family court now it
 
00:27:37.549 --> 00:27:37.559 align:start position:0%
still finds funds gals Guardian Adel
 
00:27:40.310 --> 00:27:40.320 align:start position:0%
items in the probate court and in the
 
00:27:41.810 --> 00:27:41.820 align:start position:0%
Superior Court to a certain extent again
 
00:27:44.750 --> 00:27:44.760 align:start position:0%
to um financially
 
00:27:46.970 --> 00:27:46.980 align:start position:0%
um needy people so
 
00:27:49.490 --> 00:27:49.500 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:27:53.149 --> 00:27:53.159 align:start position:0%
um yes representative Lancer
 
00:27:56.149 --> 00:27:56.159 align:start position:0%
so um not only do
 
00:27:57.830 --> 00:27:57.840 align:start position:0%
um let's say
 
00:28:00.230 --> 00:28:00.240 align:start position:0%
um after visiting the court
 
00:28:02.210 --> 00:28:02.220 align:start position:0%
um in uh Concord
 
00:28:05.090 --> 00:28:05.100 align:start position:0%
um the parenting visitation centers I
 
00:28:08.450 --> 00:28:08.460 align:start position:0%
feel like somehow they need to
 
00:28:11.029 --> 00:28:11.039 align:start position:0%
um I guess we've closed a lot of the
 
00:28:13.909 --> 00:28:13.919 align:start position:0%
centers throughout the state and I think
 
00:28:17.810 --> 00:28:17.820 align:start position:0%
somehow those need to be possibly looked
 
00:28:20.750 --> 00:28:20.760 align:start position:0%
at and figured out if there's a better
 
00:28:24.110 --> 00:28:24.120 align:start position:0%
way so that parents have the right to
 
00:28:28.490 --> 00:28:28.500 align:start position:0%
see their children when they're able to
 
00:28:33.289 --> 00:28:33.299 align:start position:0%
um and um and in you know in supervision
 
00:28:35.090 --> 00:28:35.100 align:start position:0%
um representative line so do you know
 
00:28:37.029 --> 00:28:37.039 align:start position:0%
who um
 
00:28:42.409 --> 00:28:42.419 align:start position:0%
uh who paid for the parenting centers
 
00:28:46.549 --> 00:28:46.559 align:start position:0%
um I no I do not was that in part of the
 
00:28:48.529 --> 00:28:48.539 align:start position:0%
because I'm not familiar with that and
 
00:28:50.090 --> 00:28:50.100 align:start position:0%
part of the
 
00:28:52.490 --> 00:28:52.500 align:start position:0%
um the judicial branch budget
 
00:28:56.269 --> 00:28:56.279 align:start position:0%
or or is it part of DH
 
00:28:58.430 --> 00:28:58.440 align:start position:0%
so my understanding is they were
 
00:28:59.990 --> 00:29:00.000 align:start position:0%
independently owned I don't know if they
 
00:29:02.510 --> 00:29:02.520 align:start position:0%
were licensed by the state but the the
 
00:29:04.970 --> 00:29:04.980 align:start position:0%
visiting parent had to pay and that was
 
00:29:08.029 --> 00:29:08.039 align:start position:0%
also a a high
 
00:29:10.789 --> 00:29:10.799 align:start position:0%
you know it was expensive for people I
 
00:29:12.049 --> 00:29:12.059 align:start position:0%
don't know what the state ever did run
 
00:29:13.669 --> 00:29:13.679 align:start position:0%
any I know that they've closed down I
 
00:29:15.049 --> 00:29:15.059 align:start position:0%
know there was one in Portsmouth that
 
00:29:17.510 --> 00:29:17.520 align:start position:0%
was operated by a guardian ad litem and
 
00:29:19.549 --> 00:29:19.559 align:start position:0%
an attorney and it closed down to I mean
 
00:29:20.990 --> 00:29:21.000 align:start position:0%
two years ago or three I mean they're
 
00:29:23.269 --> 00:29:23.279 align:start position:0%
just I think they were very expensive to
 
00:29:24.289 --> 00:29:24.299 align:start position:0%
have you know you had to have two
 
00:29:26.269 --> 00:29:26.279 align:start position:0%
entrances at entrance for
 
00:29:28.130 --> 00:29:28.140 align:start position:0%
um the child to come in with the one
 
00:29:29.450 --> 00:29:29.460 align:start position:0%
parent in a waiting room you had to have
 
00:29:31.490 --> 00:29:31.500 align:start position:0%
the entrance for the um other the parent
 
00:29:33.529 --> 00:29:33.539 align:start position:0%
that was being supervised you had to
 
00:29:35.810 --> 00:29:35.820 align:start position:0%
have you know a play area for them you
 
00:29:37.789 --> 00:29:37.799 align:start position:0%
know too and you had to have a glass
 
00:29:39.350 --> 00:29:39.360 align:start position:0%
window that was you know so somebody
 
00:29:41.389 --> 00:29:41.399 align:start position:0%
could be supervising and also audio so
 
00:29:43.490 --> 00:29:43.500 align:start position:0%
they could hear what was going on and
 
00:29:44.810 --> 00:29:44.820 align:start position:0%
sometimes you had to have an individual
 
00:29:46.190 --> 00:29:46.200 align:start position:0%
in the room so it's an expensive
 
00:29:48.110 --> 00:29:48.120 align:start position:0%
Endeavor and I don't believe they were
 
00:29:49.430 --> 00:29:49.440 align:start position:0%
state funded there may have been some
 
00:29:50.990 --> 00:29:51.000 align:start position:0%
money but from my understanding they
 
00:29:57.350 --> 00:29:57.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:59.149 --> 00:29:59.159 align:start position:0%
and we I think we all know historically
 
00:30:01.610 --> 00:30:01.620 align:start position:0%
that there was an incident
 
00:30:04.070 --> 00:30:04.080 align:start position:0%
so I don't didn't know a lot about it
 
00:30:06.830 --> 00:30:06.840 align:start position:0%
but what I'm um heard from a lot of the
 
00:30:09.289 --> 00:30:09.299 align:start position:0%
parents is just that it seems like
 
00:30:11.690 --> 00:30:11.700 align:start position:0%
they're having difficulty
 
00:30:11.700 --> 00:30:12.289 align:start position:0%
they're having difficulty
um

00:30:12.289 --> 00:30:12.299 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:15.230 --> 00:30:15.240 align:start position:0%
finding it a place that they can
 
00:30:18.769 --> 00:30:18.779 align:start position:0%
actually change off even with
 
00:30:21.409 --> 00:30:21.419 align:start position:0%
transporting a child into the other
 
00:30:21.419 --> 00:30:22.750 align:start position:0%
transporting a child into the other
parent

00:30:22.750 --> 00:30:22.760 align:start position:0%
parent
 
00:30:26.570 --> 00:30:26.580 align:start position:0%
and then also having needing a
 
00:30:29.810 --> 00:30:29.820 align:start position:0%
supervision and sometimes they'd have to
 
00:30:33.049 --> 00:30:33.059 align:start position:0%
go to a police station with the child
 
00:30:35.690 --> 00:30:35.700 align:start position:0%
and I don't know if that's the most
 
00:30:38.090 --> 00:30:38.100 align:start position:0%
appropriate place for the children to
 
00:30:41.750 --> 00:30:41.760 align:start position:0%
each time have to have that happen so I
 
00:30:44.769 --> 00:30:44.779 align:start position:0%
was just thinking for the children
 
00:30:46.789 --> 00:30:46.799 align:start position:0%
as well so
 
00:30:49.250 --> 00:30:49.260 align:start position:0%
you know what troubles me about this is
 
00:30:52.970 --> 00:30:52.980 align:start position:0%
is this something that
 
00:30:56.210 --> 00:30:56.220 align:start position:0%
the the concern is legitimate is the
 
00:31:00.830 --> 00:31:00.840 align:start position:0%
solution something that belongs to
 
00:31:03.529 --> 00:31:03.539 align:start position:0%
the judicial branch
 
00:31:03.539 --> 00:31:05.570 align:start position:0%
the judicial branch
um

00:31:05.570 --> 00:31:05.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:31:08.269 --> 00:31:08.279 align:start position:0%
and and I don't know the answer I mean I
 
00:31:09.590 --> 00:31:09.600 align:start position:0%
you know I don't know the answer
 
00:31:09.600 --> 00:31:12.350 align:start position:0%
you know I don't know the answer
representative

00:31:12.350 --> 00:31:12.360 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:31:15.950 --> 00:31:15.960 align:start position:0%
so I'm not sure about that but I I do I
 
00:31:17.990 --> 00:31:18.000 align:start position:0%
do have a lot of concern about expanding
 
00:31:19.610 --> 00:31:19.620 align:start position:0%
the visitation centers because I do
 
00:31:22.850 --> 00:31:22.860 align:start position:0%
think in general that if a family member
 
00:31:25.070 --> 00:31:25.080 align:start position:0%
can supervise you know if there's a
 
00:31:27.350 --> 00:31:27.360 align:start position:0%
parent that you know there is actual
 
00:31:29.990 --> 00:31:30.000 align:start position:0%
evidence that they may be of you know
 
00:31:33.350 --> 00:31:33.360 align:start position:0%
harm potential harm to the child I think
 
00:31:35.570 --> 00:31:35.580 align:start position:0%
that that the least restrictive
 
00:31:37.730 --> 00:31:37.740 align:start position:0%
environment for that parent to visit
 
00:31:40.430 --> 00:31:40.440 align:start position:0%
with the child is ultimately what's in
 
00:31:41.870 --> 00:31:41.880 align:start position:0%
the best interest of everybody and if
 
00:31:44.570 --> 00:31:44.580 align:start position:0%
that means having you know a grandparent
 
00:31:47.090 --> 00:31:47.100 align:start position:0%
of the child supervising the visitation
 
00:31:48.889 --> 00:31:48.899 align:start position:0%
or whatnot somebody that's familiar to
 
00:31:50.510 --> 00:31:50.520 align:start position:0%
the child in a familiar environment I
 
00:31:53.049 --> 00:31:53.059 align:start position:0%
think that that's much
 
00:31:56.570 --> 00:31:56.580 align:start position:0%
better for the child to be you know with
 
00:32:00.169 --> 00:32:00.179 align:start position:0%
known people than for
 
00:32:03.110 --> 00:32:03.120 align:start position:0%
and I and regarding like the exchange
 
00:32:04.669 --> 00:32:04.679 align:start position:0%
off I hear you're concern about the
 
00:32:06.649 --> 00:32:06.659 align:start position:0%
police station I've always you know
 
00:32:08.330 --> 00:32:08.340 align:start position:0%
taught my kids you know never to be
 
00:32:09.950 --> 00:32:09.960 align:start position:0%
afraid of the police or the firemen or
 
00:32:11.090 --> 00:32:11.100 align:start position:0%
whatnot because I want them to know that
 
00:32:12.889 --> 00:32:12.899 align:start position:0%
they can go somewhere for help yeah no
 
00:32:15.409 --> 00:32:15.419 align:start position:0%
but I in the sense of I don't associate
 
00:32:17.029 --> 00:32:17.039 align:start position:0%
like going to the police station with
 
00:32:19.250 --> 00:32:19.260 align:start position:0%
trouble I just associate it with you
 
00:32:21.529 --> 00:32:21.539 align:start position:0%
know they help people so in that regard
 
00:32:23.810 --> 00:32:23.820 align:start position:0%
I don't necessarily think that it has a
 
00:32:25.610 --> 00:32:25.620 align:start position:0%
bad connotation of exchanging there I
 
00:32:28.549 --> 00:32:28.559 align:start position:0%
know a lot of parents who do Exchange in
 
00:32:29.810 --> 00:32:29.820 align:start position:0%
the beginning of their divorce at the
 
00:32:30.950 --> 00:32:30.960 align:start position:0%
police station just because they're high
 
00:32:32.450 --> 00:32:32.460 align:start position:0%
conflict and they like that there's
 
00:32:34.130 --> 00:32:34.140 align:start position:0%
security cameras outside of the police
 
00:32:36.470 --> 00:32:36.480 align:start position:0%
station and if there were to be some
 
00:32:37.789 --> 00:32:37.799 align:start position:0%
disagreement that they know that there's
 
00:32:39.470 --> 00:32:39.480 align:start position:0%
a police officer inside and I've asked
 
00:32:41.990 --> 00:32:42.000 align:start position:0%
at least in my town if the police
 
00:32:43.490 --> 00:32:43.500 align:start position:0%
station minds and they don't mind at all
 
00:32:44.930 --> 00:32:44.940 align:start position:0%
if somebody feels you know more
 
00:32:46.789 --> 00:32:46.799 align:start position:0%
comfortable exchanging in their parking
 
00:32:48.649 --> 00:32:48.659 align:start position:0%
lot they're perfectly fine with it they
 
00:32:50.029 --> 00:32:50.039 align:start position:0%
don't have any issues with it the
 
00:32:51.110 --> 00:32:51.120 align:start position:0%
parents aren't actually going inside
 
00:32:52.490 --> 00:32:52.500 align:start position:0%
they're usually just exchanging the
 
00:32:54.529 --> 00:32:54.539 align:start position:0%
kiddos in the parking lot
 
00:32:56.870 --> 00:32:56.880 align:start position:0%
um so I would kind of be more in favor
 
00:32:56.880 --> 00:32:59.090 align:start position:0%
um so I would kind of be more in favor
of

00:32:59.090 --> 00:32:59.100 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:33:01.430 --> 00:33:01.440 align:start position:0%
not necessarily going I think I think
 
00:33:04.610 --> 00:33:04.620 align:start position:0%
the you know the visitation centers
 
00:33:07.010 --> 00:33:07.020 align:start position:0%
take away from the parenting that the
 
00:33:08.630 --> 00:33:08.640 align:start position:0%
parents actually can do because they're
 
00:33:10.130 --> 00:33:10.140 align:start position:0%
in you know this
 
00:33:12.350 --> 00:33:12.360 align:start position:0%
kind of sterile room so to speak with
 
00:33:14.149 --> 00:33:14.159 align:start position:0%
their kiddos and it's not is that really
 
00:33:17.450 --> 00:33:17.460 align:start position:0%
great parenting time with their child
 
00:33:20.870 --> 00:33:20.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:23.570 --> 00:33:23.580 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair uh so
 
00:33:25.789 --> 00:33:25.799 align:start position:0%
representative Macbeth and I witnessed
 
00:33:29.630 --> 00:33:29.640 align:start position:0%
the case where in the final decree the
 
00:33:32.029 --> 00:33:32.039 align:start position:0%
uh one of the parents was to have a laid
 
00:33:33.370 --> 00:33:33.380 align:start position:0%
act evaluation
 
00:33:36.710 --> 00:33:36.720 align:start position:0%
and the the party said I didn't even
 
00:33:39.590 --> 00:33:39.600 align:start position:0%
look at my final degree now the other
 
00:33:41.630 --> 00:33:41.640 align:start position:0%
party was concerned about visitations
 
00:33:44.389 --> 00:33:44.399 align:start position:0%
because of the drinking and that what
 
00:33:48.230 --> 00:33:48.240 align:start position:0%
why they separated and and the party was
 
00:33:50.210 --> 00:33:50.220 align:start position:0%
still concerned about the drinking and
 
00:33:50.220 --> 00:33:51.350 align:start position:0%
still concerned about the drinking and
and

00:33:51.350 --> 00:33:51.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:33:53.389 --> 00:33:53.399 align:start position:0%
you know three weeks three months have
 
00:33:57.110 --> 00:33:57.120 align:start position:0%
gone by and you know the children have
 
00:33:59.870 --> 00:33:59.880 align:start position:0%
told stories of what's happening when
 
00:34:02.149 --> 00:34:02.159 align:start position:0%
this party is drinking
 
00:34:04.970 --> 00:34:04.980 align:start position:0%
um so that there there was no really no
 
00:34:08.270 --> 00:34:08.280 align:start position:0%
fix I mean a supervised visitation could
 
00:34:10.849 --> 00:34:10.859 align:start position:0%
have been a fix because now
 
00:34:12.889 --> 00:34:12.899 align:start position:0%
you know the judge recommended that you
 
00:34:16.129 --> 00:34:16.139 align:start position:0%
get a laid act evaluation ASAP so in the
 
00:34:18.290 --> 00:34:18.300 align:start position:0%
meantime until the next hearing
 
00:34:20.629 --> 00:34:20.639 align:start position:0%
the children got to go to the other
 
00:34:20.639 --> 00:34:22.190 align:start position:0%
the children got to go to the other
party

00:34:22.190 --> 00:34:22.200 align:start position:0%
party
 
00:34:26.030 --> 00:34:26.040 align:start position:0%
with the other parent being concerned of
 
00:34:27.349 --> 00:34:27.359 align:start position:0%
the drinking
 
00:34:29.030 --> 00:34:29.040 align:start position:0%
um so it's so I think and then and I
 
00:34:30.710 --> 00:34:30.720 align:start position:0%
know in Manchester
 
00:34:30.720 --> 00:34:31.909 align:start position:0%
know in Manchester
um

00:34:31.909 --> 00:34:31.919 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:33.950 --> 00:34:33.960 align:start position:0%
the Manchester Police Department is
 
00:34:35.990 --> 00:34:36.000 align:start position:0%
called often if they're gonna If the
 
00:34:37.369 --> 00:34:37.379 align:start position:0%
parents are gonna meet in the parking
 
00:34:37.379 --> 00:34:38.089 align:start position:0%
parents are gonna meet in the parking
lot

00:34:38.089 --> 00:34:38.099 align:start position:0%
lot
 
00:34:40.190 --> 00:34:40.200 align:start position:0%
uh they call uh they call the police
 
00:34:42.470 --> 00:34:42.480 align:start position:0%
department and they ask for somebody to
 
00:34:44.210 --> 00:34:44.220 align:start position:0%
be there and they'll if they have
 
00:34:45.770 --> 00:34:45.780 align:start position:0%
somebody available they'll have them
 
00:34:48.829 --> 00:34:48.839 align:start position:0%
there and that has gone you know instead
 
00:34:50.169 --> 00:34:50.179 align:start position:0%
of having to meet at the police station
 
00:34:52.609 --> 00:34:52.619 align:start position:0%
so they have also have done that and I'm
 
00:34:54.770 --> 00:34:54.780 align:start position:0%
wondering on um
 
00:34:57.470 --> 00:34:57.480 align:start position:0%
on mental health evaluations is is that
 
00:34:59.510 --> 00:34:59.520 align:start position:0%
always a
 
00:35:02.270 --> 00:35:02.280 align:start position:0%
a clinical clinician that's doing those
 
00:35:05.329 --> 00:35:05.339 align:start position:0%
evaluations always it's not okay so
 
00:35:07.190 --> 00:35:07.200 align:start position:0%
there's no other way so it's always a
 
00:35:10.730 --> 00:35:10.740 align:start position:0%
because uh because the laidac
 
00:35:10.740 --> 00:35:12.609 align:start position:0%
because uh because the laidac
um

00:35:12.609 --> 00:35:12.619 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:15.109 --> 00:35:15.119 align:start position:0%
I don't believe they're clinicians I
 
00:35:17.089 --> 00:35:17.099 align:start position:0%
think latex they're
 
00:35:19.910 --> 00:35:19.920 align:start position:0%
I don't know I don't know what a layback
 
00:35:23.829 --> 00:35:23.839 align:start position:0%
is I'm licensed alcohol and drug okay
 
00:35:27.710 --> 00:35:27.720 align:start position:0%
if somebody hasn't actually been found
 
00:35:30.530 --> 00:35:30.540 align:start position:0%
to have like had an alcohol problem in
 
00:35:32.030 --> 00:35:32.040 align:start position:0%
terms of they don't have like a previous
 
00:35:35.150 --> 00:35:35.160 align:start position:0%
DUI or something like that
 
00:35:36.950 --> 00:35:36.960 align:start position:0%
I do have a little bit of a concern
 
00:35:38.750 --> 00:35:38.760 align:start position:0%
about how much presumption we're taking
 
00:35:41.150 --> 00:35:41.160 align:start position:0%
that they can't see their kids you know
 
00:35:43.250 --> 00:35:43.260 align:start position:0%
like and I and I do know of cases where
 
00:35:44.990 --> 00:35:45.000 align:start position:0%
they're ha you know I have been
 
00:35:47.930 --> 00:35:47.940 align:start position:0%
alcoholic parents where they had
 
00:35:49.490 --> 00:35:49.500 align:start position:0%
supervised visitation by grandparents
 
00:35:50.810 --> 00:35:50.820 align:start position:0%
the grandparents slept over at their
 
00:35:52.550 --> 00:35:52.560 align:start position:0%
house for the night and supervised
 
00:35:55.190 --> 00:35:55.200 align:start position:0%
transporting the child back and forth
 
00:35:57.290 --> 00:35:57.300 align:start position:0%
um so I think even in those cases it's
 
00:35:58.790 --> 00:35:58.800 align:start position:0%
still the supervision still could be
 
00:36:01.310 --> 00:36:01.320 align:start position:0%
done you know in a less restrictive
 
00:36:04.370 --> 00:36:04.380 align:start position:0%
environment than in a supervised
 
00:36:06.290 --> 00:36:06.300 align:start position:0%
Center but I mean I guess to your point
 
00:36:09.109 --> 00:36:09.119 align:start position:0%
if if a police officers are willing to
 
00:36:10.670 --> 00:36:10.680 align:start position:0%
meet in a parking lot they're standing
 
00:36:12.410 --> 00:36:12.420 align:start position:0%
there I mean a police officer is trained
 
00:36:14.150 --> 00:36:14.160 align:start position:0%
to know if somebody is intoxicated or
 
00:36:18.349 --> 00:36:18.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:20.270 --> 00:36:20.280 align:start position:0%
obviously there's there's a lot of
 
00:36:22.010 --> 00:36:22.020 align:start position:0%
questions about that oh representative
 
00:36:22.020 --> 00:36:23.329 align:start position:0%
questions about that oh representative
Paul

00:36:23.329 --> 00:36:23.339 align:start position:0%
Paul
 
00:36:25.130 --> 00:36:25.140 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chairman
 
00:36:26.930 --> 00:36:26.940 align:start position:0%
um so I just wanted to kind of go back
 
00:36:31.069 --> 00:36:31.079 align:start position:0%
Circle back to the casa I was trained as
 
00:36:34.250 --> 00:36:34.260 align:start position:0%
a casa it was many years ago and now
 
00:36:35.810 --> 00:36:35.820 align:start position:0%
coming forward to the conversation we're
 
00:36:38.690 --> 00:36:38.700 align:start position:0%
having now the child
 
00:36:42.290 --> 00:36:42.300 align:start position:0%
um that was removed from the parent
 
00:36:44.450 --> 00:36:44.460 align:start position:0%
um was removed because drugs were found
 
00:36:47.030 --> 00:36:47.040 align:start position:0%
next to the crib or another time because
 
00:36:49.210 --> 00:36:49.220 align:start position:0%
drugs were found next to his car seat
 
00:36:52.069 --> 00:36:52.079 align:start position:0%
however because the ten-year-old sister
 
00:36:54.170 --> 00:36:54.180 align:start position:0%
was not in the house when the drugs were
 
00:36:55.730 --> 00:36:55.740 align:start position:0%
found and was not in the car when the
 
00:36:57.710 --> 00:36:57.720 align:start position:0%
drugs were found she was not removed
 
00:36:58.790 --> 00:36:58.800 align:start position:0%
from the parent
 
00:37:02.930 --> 00:37:02.940 align:start position:0%
so it's interesting that in this case
 
00:37:05.150 --> 00:37:05.160 align:start position:0%
when you have a parent who's drinking
 
00:37:07.490 --> 00:37:07.500 align:start position:0%
but there's been no allegations of them
 
00:37:09.530 --> 00:37:09.540 align:start position:0%
driving with the child or putting the
 
00:37:11.990 --> 00:37:12.000 align:start position:0%
Child In Harm's Way
 
00:37:13.790 --> 00:37:13.800 align:start position:0%
um we're going to use that as a reason
 
00:37:17.870 --> 00:37:17.880 align:start position:0%
to lessen their visitation or require a
 
00:37:19.670 --> 00:37:19.680 align:start position:0%
stronger visitation when yet when we're
 
00:37:22.069 --> 00:37:22.079 align:start position:0%
looking at the other court that's not a
 
00:37:23.690 --> 00:37:23.700 align:start position:0%
reason to remove that child from the
 
00:37:26.329 --> 00:37:26.339 align:start position:0%
home or from the parent and then just to
 
00:37:29.089 --> 00:37:29.099 align:start position:0%
go back Casa is at least one and it
 
00:37:30.650 --> 00:37:30.660 align:start position:0%
could have changed over the years but
 
00:37:33.109 --> 00:37:33.119 align:start position:0%
when I was trained I was to be a voice
 
00:37:35.930 --> 00:37:35.940 align:start position:0%
for the child and I went to all the
 
00:37:38.150 --> 00:37:38.160 align:start position:0%
meetings and I I went to the house and I
 
00:37:39.890 --> 00:37:39.900 align:start position:0%
looked at the house for make sure it was
 
00:37:39.900 --> 00:37:41.030 align:start position:0%
looked at the house for make sure it was
safe

00:37:41.030 --> 00:37:41.040 align:start position:0%
safe
 
00:37:41.040 --> 00:37:41.750 align:start position:0%
safe
um

00:37:41.750 --> 00:37:41.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:45.109 --> 00:37:45.119 align:start position:0%
but I didn't give any opinions although
 
00:37:47.089 --> 00:37:47.099 align:start position:0%
I was asked what you know is a child
 
00:37:49.250 --> 00:37:49.260 align:start position:0%
safe and whatever but I just wanted to
 
00:37:52.250 --> 00:37:52.260 align:start position:0%
clarify that thank you
 
00:37:54.589 --> 00:37:54.599 align:start position:0%
representative Macbeth thank you so one
 
00:37:56.150 --> 00:37:56.160 align:start position:0%
thing I'm really struck by is the
 
00:37:58.490 --> 00:37:58.500 align:start position:0%
overlap of we've got the police and
 
00:38:00.170 --> 00:38:00.180 align:start position:0%
we've got dcyf because as far as
 
00:38:01.790 --> 00:38:01.800 align:start position:0%
removing a child and just removing one
 
00:38:03.589 --> 00:38:03.599 align:start position:0%
that would have been not the quartz that
 
00:38:05.630 --> 00:38:05.640 align:start position:0%
would have been dcyf I believe we've got
 
00:38:07.550 --> 00:38:07.560 align:start position:0%
you know the office of licensure and
 
00:38:10.609 --> 00:38:10.619 align:start position:0%
gals we've got the judicial uh and
 
00:38:12.950 --> 00:38:12.960 align:start position:0%
they're I think some communication I
 
00:38:15.050 --> 00:38:15.060 align:start position:0%
think that looking at the 10 000 foot
 
00:38:15.060 --> 00:38:15.950 align:start position:0%
think that looking at the 10 000 foot
View

00:38:15.950 --> 00:38:15.960 align:start position:0%
View
 
00:38:18.050 --> 00:38:18.060 align:start position:0%
some type of coordination and best
 
00:38:18.060 --> 00:38:19.810 align:start position:0%
some type of coordination and best
practices

00:38:19.810 --> 00:38:19.820 align:start position:0%
practices
 
00:38:23.150 --> 00:38:23.160 align:start position:0%
and really talking one of the things I'm
 
00:38:24.770 --> 00:38:24.780 align:start position:0%
struck by with some of the antidotes
 
00:38:26.390 --> 00:38:26.400 align:start position:0%
that we've got here and again and I I
 
00:38:28.430 --> 00:38:28.440 align:start position:0%
really resist antidotes but the thing
 
00:38:30.290 --> 00:38:30.300 align:start position:0%
about the police station I've had some
 
00:38:31.790 --> 00:38:31.800 align:start position:0%
parents I mean they say it's just like
 
00:38:33.950 --> 00:38:33.960 align:start position:0%
going to school the the police off they
 
00:38:35.990 --> 00:38:36.000 align:start position:0%
have a drop-off Lane you can either do
 
00:38:38.750 --> 00:38:38.760 align:start position:0%
it for kids or Amazon you know not
 
00:38:40.849 --> 00:38:40.859 align:start position:0%
Amazon but Facebook or I mean I don't
 
00:38:42.170 --> 00:38:42.180 align:start position:0%
mean to put I don't mean to make light
 
00:38:43.609 --> 00:38:43.619 align:start position:0%
of it but it is something that is
 
00:38:45.230 --> 00:38:45.240 align:start position:0%
monitored it's a lane that monitored the
 
00:38:47.150 --> 00:38:47.160 align:start position:0%
police you don't necessarily call in you
 
00:38:48.470 --> 00:38:48.480 align:start position:0%
know it's just something you know that
 
00:38:50.329 --> 00:38:50.339 align:start position:0%
that safety is there for you someone's
 
00:38:51.410 --> 00:38:51.420 align:start position:0%
going to be watching you know the
 
00:38:52.490 --> 00:38:52.500 align:start position:0%
windows there
 
00:38:55.310 --> 00:38:55.320 align:start position:0%
versus places where you pick the police
 
00:38:56.810 --> 00:38:56.820 align:start position:0%
station but you don't know whether they
 
00:38:58.849 --> 00:38:58.859 align:start position:0%
have cameras where you're parked or
 
00:39:00.650 --> 00:39:00.660 align:start position:0%
whatever so I think that that's what I'm
 
00:39:02.089 --> 00:39:02.099 align:start position:0%
talking about maybe coordinating this
 
00:39:04.490 --> 00:39:04.500 align:start position:0%
because I know as far as um and the
 
00:39:07.730 --> 00:39:07.740 align:start position:0%
courts when I do a parenting plan I ask
 
00:39:09.230 --> 00:39:09.240 align:start position:0%
the parents what time is good and if
 
00:39:10.550 --> 00:39:10.560 align:start position:0%
they don't know then I just pick a time
 
00:39:11.810 --> 00:39:11.820 align:start position:0%
you know what would be good for me on
 
00:39:13.130 --> 00:39:13.140 align:start position:0%
Friday night to change or Sunday night
 
00:39:15.290 --> 00:39:15.300 align:start position:0%
to change I just thought wouldn't it be
 
00:39:16.730 --> 00:39:16.740 align:start position:0%
great and then the court looks at the
 
00:39:17.930 --> 00:39:17.940 align:start position:0%
parenting plan and you know makes a
 
00:39:19.310 --> 00:39:19.320 align:start position:0%
decision but wouldn't it be great if we
 
00:39:20.810 --> 00:39:20.820 align:start position:0%
talked to police stations if that's what
 
00:39:22.370 --> 00:39:22.380 align:start position:0%
we're going to be suggesting people do a
 
00:39:23.990 --> 00:39:24.000 align:start position:0%
transfer at and say you know what time
 
00:39:25.550 --> 00:39:25.560 align:start position:0%
of day is good for you I mean it still
 
00:39:26.870 --> 00:39:26.880 align:start position:0%
has to be good for the family I'm not
 
00:39:29.210 --> 00:39:29.220 align:start position:0%
saying that but the other thing I wanted
 
00:39:31.730 --> 00:39:31.740 align:start position:0%
to again this is my experience I'm
 
00:39:33.109 --> 00:39:33.119 align:start position:0%
representative qatab and I'd be
 
00:39:34.250 --> 00:39:34.260 align:start position:0%
interested because it sounds like you
 
00:39:36.109 --> 00:39:36.119 align:start position:0%
had some data as far as what guardian
 
00:39:37.550 --> 00:39:37.560 align:start position:0%
and items we're recommending and stuff
 
00:39:40.250 --> 00:39:40.260 align:start position:0%
it is only in the most severe cases that
 
00:39:43.190 --> 00:39:43.200 align:start position:0%
these um supervised parenting centers
 
00:39:45.050 --> 00:39:45.060 align:start position:0%
are being used and I'm talking about
 
00:39:47.810 --> 00:39:47.820 align:start position:0%
when uh you know I mean you know you've
 
00:39:50.470 --> 00:39:50.480 align:start position:0%
got several different parents involved
 
00:39:53.210 --> 00:39:53.220 align:start position:0%
parents maybe a biological parent that's
 
00:39:55.490 --> 00:39:55.500 align:start position:0%
now lost their a bit but
 
00:39:58.069 --> 00:39:58.079 align:start position:0%
addiction children people that okay I'm
 
00:40:00.170 --> 00:40:00.180 align:start position:0%
just gonna say people parents that have
 
00:40:01.970 --> 00:40:01.980 align:start position:0%
tried to commit suicide with their
 
00:40:03.890 --> 00:40:03.900 align:start position:0%
children in bed with them people that
 
00:40:06.230 --> 00:40:06.240 align:start position:0%
are have been convicted of assaulting
 
00:40:09.650 --> 00:40:09.660 align:start position:0%
their child and breaking a bone
 
00:40:11.810 --> 00:40:11.820 align:start position:0%
um and then people that are in active
 
00:40:14.569 --> 00:40:14.579 align:start position:0%
addiction trying to get help but they
 
00:40:17.510 --> 00:40:17.520 align:start position:0%
can't and so having the drugs that were
 
00:40:19.310 --> 00:40:19.320 align:start position:0%
mentioned here and we have so much of
 
00:40:22.250 --> 00:40:22.260 align:start position:0%
that and grandparents a lot of times
 
00:40:24.710 --> 00:40:24.720 align:start position:0%
family have already done that hands off
 
00:40:26.630 --> 00:40:26.640 align:start position:0%
until you're in treatment so you don't
 
00:40:30.170 --> 00:40:30.180 align:start position:0%
have family members that can and you
 
00:40:32.870 --> 00:40:32.880 align:start position:0%
know the the bottom line is what a lot
 
00:40:34.730 --> 00:40:34.740 align:start position:0%
of counselors and people know is that if
 
00:40:37.130 --> 00:40:37.140 align:start position:0%
a child loses all contact with a
 
00:40:39.109 --> 00:40:39.119 align:start position:0%
significant adult a parent or
 
00:40:40.430 --> 00:40:40.440 align:start position:0%
grandparent that has been in their life
 
00:40:42.710 --> 00:40:42.720 align:start position:0%
they can suffer significant you know
 
00:40:45.829 --> 00:40:45.839 align:start position:0%
issues later on so it's not just this
 
00:40:47.870 --> 00:40:47.880 align:start position:0%
parents right it's really the child's
 
00:40:51.470 --> 00:40:51.480 align:start position:0%
right too to not have that withdrawal or
 
00:40:53.450 --> 00:40:53.460 align:start position:0%
that um you know alienation that does
 
00:40:56.089 --> 00:40:56.099 align:start position:0%
happen that so I mean and I do support
 
00:40:57.650 --> 00:40:57.660 align:start position:0%
the parenting rights I just want to say
 
00:40:59.089 --> 00:40:59.099 align:start position:0%
I also
 
00:41:00.349 --> 00:41:00.359 align:start position:0%
um as a guardian light and look at
 
00:41:02.270 --> 00:41:02.280 align:start position:0%
everybody's rights I mean and and it is
 
00:41:05.030 --> 00:41:05.040 align:start position:0%
the child's right to to have some still
 
00:41:06.770 --> 00:41:06.780 align:start position:0%
maintain that contact in a safe place
 
00:41:08.270 --> 00:41:08.280 align:start position:0%
and it can only be every two or three
 
00:41:11.210 --> 00:41:11.220 align:start position:0%
you know whatever they can work out so
 
00:41:12.770 --> 00:41:12.780 align:start position:0%
um but I would be interested and I don't
 
00:41:14.510 --> 00:41:14.520 align:start position:0%
know if there are data because it sounds
 
00:41:15.829 --> 00:41:15.839 align:start position:0%
like you might have had some about the
 
00:41:17.329 --> 00:41:17.339 align:start position:0%
mental health recommendations and these
 
00:41:19.250 --> 00:41:19.260 align:start position:0%
but again
 
00:41:22.790 --> 00:41:22.800 align:start position:0%
and to representative long I I don't
 
00:41:23.930 --> 00:41:23.940 align:start position:0%
know who would have represented somebody
 
00:41:25.370 --> 00:41:25.380 align:start position:0%
but I had someone that didn't do their
 
00:41:27.349 --> 00:41:27.359 align:start position:0%
laidac and you know they they kept
 
00:41:28.790 --> 00:41:28.800 align:start position:0%
telling me they would but it's like six
 
00:41:30.589 --> 00:41:30.599 align:start position:0%
months a year to get them not only the
 
00:41:33.170 --> 00:41:33.180 align:start position:0%
cost and so they went online and got one
 
00:41:35.390 --> 00:41:35.400 align:start position:0%
and it was uh someone that had I think
 
00:41:37.670 --> 00:41:37.680 align:start position:0%
they I don't know if it's a PhD or it's
 
00:41:39.829 --> 00:41:39.839 align:start position:0%
a it's a higher level I'm not sure
 
00:41:42.109 --> 00:41:42.119 align:start position:0%
exactly it's a mental health degree
 
00:41:43.730 --> 00:41:43.740 align:start position:0%
um and they were able to get it online
 
00:41:45.650 --> 00:41:45.660 align:start position:0%
and I was impressed that it was thorough
 
00:41:47.510 --> 00:41:47.520 align:start position:0%
but again it was
 
00:41:49.010 --> 00:41:49.020 align:start position:0%
um you know two thousand dollars out of
 
00:41:50.630 --> 00:41:50.640 align:start position:0%
their pocket so
 
00:41:52.010 --> 00:41:52.020 align:start position:0%
I don't think courts are over
 
00:41:53.450 --> 00:41:53.460 align:start position:0%
recommending it in my experience it's
 
00:41:55.370 --> 00:41:55.380 align:start position:0%
always beneficial because I think that
 
00:41:56.930 --> 00:41:56.940 align:start position:0%
you can see what basically we're looking
 
00:41:58.910 --> 00:41:58.920 align:start position:0%
for untreated things are you treating
 
00:42:00.589 --> 00:42:00.599 align:start position:0%
you know you we take people as they are
 
00:42:03.290 --> 00:42:03.300 align:start position:0%
but are you doing the best so that you
 
00:42:04.910 --> 00:42:04.920 align:start position:0%
can have the parenting skills you need
 
00:42:06.170 --> 00:42:06.180 align:start position:0%
to keep a child safe and meet their
 
00:42:06.180 --> 00:42:07.490 align:start position:0%
to keep a child safe and meet their
needs

00:42:07.490 --> 00:42:07.500 align:start position:0%
needs
 
00:42:09.710 --> 00:42:09.720 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Macbeth
 
00:42:09.720 --> 00:42:11.390 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Macbeth
um

00:42:11.390 --> 00:42:11.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:11.400 --> 00:42:12.890 align:start position:0%
um
I

00:42:12.890 --> 00:42:12.900 align:start position:0%
I
 
00:42:17.030 --> 00:42:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:20.930 --> 00:42:20.940 align:start position:0%
we are living in a world
 
00:42:20.940 --> 00:42:22.069 align:start position:0%
we are living in a world
um

00:42:22.069 --> 00:42:22.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:22.079 --> 00:42:25.810 align:start position:0%
um
where

00:42:25.810 --> 00:42:25.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:29.230 --> 00:42:29.240 align:start position:0%
there there is a great deal of
 
00:42:33.890 --> 00:42:33.900 align:start position:0%
Misfortune a great deal of of tension a
 
00:42:36.290 --> 00:42:36.300 align:start position:0%
great deal of
 
00:42:43.370 --> 00:42:43.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:44.890 --> 00:42:44.900 align:start position:0%
the the the
 
00:42:48.589 --> 00:42:48.599 align:start position:0%
arena is huge
 
00:42:51.770 --> 00:42:51.780 align:start position:0%
but here we are
 
00:42:55.370 --> 00:42:55.380 align:start position:0%
trying to look just at
 
00:42:58.250 --> 00:42:58.260 align:start position:0%
the family court
 
00:43:00.230 --> 00:43:00.240 align:start position:0%
the family court
 
00:43:03.170 --> 00:43:03.180 align:start position:0%
can't possibly solve
 
00:43:05.089 --> 00:43:05.099 align:start position:0%
all the problems
 
00:43:08.030 --> 00:43:08.040 align:start position:0%
that that families
 
00:43:12.230 --> 00:43:12.240 align:start position:0%
are experiencing across the country
 
00:43:12.240 --> 00:43:13.010 align:start position:0%
are experiencing across the country
um

00:43:13.010 --> 00:43:13.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:16.790 --> 00:43:16.800 align:start position:0%
and yet just in the examples that we've
 
00:43:18.130 --> 00:43:18.140 align:start position:0%
talked about
 
00:43:22.190 --> 00:43:22.200 align:start position:0%
we have the family court we have dcyf we
 
00:43:24.349 --> 00:43:24.359 align:start position:0%
have Health and Human Services we have
 
00:43:26.390 --> 00:43:26.400 align:start position:0%
the police
 
00:43:26.400 --> 00:43:27.250 align:start position:0%
the police
um

00:43:27.250 --> 00:43:27.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:31.910 --> 00:43:31.920 align:start position:0%
we have uh trained professionals I mean
 
00:43:38.510 --> 00:43:38.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:38.520 --> 00:43:40.130 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:43:40.130 --> 00:43:40.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:43.550 --> 00:43:43.560 align:start position:0%
certainly the Court's decisions can't
 
00:43:45.670 --> 00:43:45.680 align:start position:0%
make everyone happy
 
00:43:49.150 --> 00:43:49.160 align:start position:0%
although by and large
 
00:43:51.849 --> 00:43:51.859 align:start position:0%
they do
 
00:43:57.050 --> 00:43:57.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:00.050 --> 00:44:00.060 align:start position:0%
manage the majority of cases not all the
 
00:44:02.510 --> 00:44:02.520 align:start position:0%
cases by any means but certainly the
 
00:44:04.849 --> 00:44:04.859 align:start position:0%
majority of cases
 
00:44:04.859 --> 00:44:05.809 align:start position:0%
majority of cases
um

00:44:05.809 --> 00:44:05.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:07.670 --> 00:44:07.680 align:start position:0%
we will never
 
00:44:09.829 --> 00:44:09.839 align:start position:0%
we could struggle to create a more
 
00:44:13.190 --> 00:44:13.200 align:start position:0%
perfect union but we're not likely to
 
00:44:14.870 --> 00:44:14.880 align:start position:0%
achieve that
 
00:44:17.270 --> 00:44:17.280 align:start position:0%
so what I want
 
00:44:22.910 --> 00:44:22.920 align:start position:0%
help with is what can we focus on
 
00:44:28.010 --> 00:44:28.020 align:start position:0%
that involves the family court
 
00:44:31.730 --> 00:44:31.740 align:start position:0%
where we can focus our energy and part
 
00:44:35.690 --> 00:44:35.700 align:start position:0%
of that might very well be to make clear
 
00:44:38.809 --> 00:44:38.819 align:start position:0%
that it isn't the family Court's
 
00:44:41.150 --> 00:44:41.160 align:start position:0%
responsibility to act as if they would
 
00:44:45.710 --> 00:44:45.720 align:start position:0%
dcyf for example or as if they were
 
00:44:45.720 --> 00:44:50.329 align:start position:0%
dcyf for example or as if they were
um uh

00:44:50.329 --> 00:44:50.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:54.010 --> 00:44:54.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:56.390 --> 00:44:56.400 align:start position:0%
institutions it attempts to you know
 
00:44:58.430 --> 00:44:58.440 align:start position:0%
address drug issues
 
00:44:58.440 --> 00:44:59.890 align:start position:0%
address drug issues
um

00:44:59.890 --> 00:44:59.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:03.770 --> 00:45:03.780 align:start position:0%
they have to engage obviously with all
 
00:45:05.569 --> 00:45:05.579 align:start position:0%
these other factors in the society but
 
00:45:08.569 --> 00:45:08.579 align:start position:0%
what can we focus on
 
00:45:11.690 --> 00:45:11.700 align:start position:0%
it's the family court where their piece
 
00:45:14.450 --> 00:45:14.460 align:start position:0%
of the action so to speak
 
00:45:18.290 --> 00:45:18.300 align:start position:0%
is given all the due regard that it
 
00:45:21.109 --> 00:45:21.119 align:start position:0%
deserves and the support
 
00:45:22.790 --> 00:45:22.800 align:start position:0%
that it
 
00:45:22.800 --> 00:45:24.829 align:start position:0%
that it
um

00:45:24.829 --> 00:45:24.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:29.569 --> 00:45:29.579 align:start position:0%
that the state is obliged to provide
 
00:45:31.790 --> 00:45:31.800 align:start position:0%
because we have
 
00:45:34.130 --> 00:45:34.140 align:start position:0%
an obligation
 
00:45:36.050 --> 00:45:36.060 align:start position:0%
representative ball and then represents
 
00:45:37.309 --> 00:45:37.319 align:start position:0%
caught up
 
00:45:39.589 --> 00:45:39.599 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman uh chairwoman I'm
 
00:45:40.970 --> 00:45:40.980 align:start position:0%
sorry it's okay
 
00:45:43.849 --> 00:45:43.859 align:start position:0%
um I respectfully agree with everything
 
00:45:47.930 --> 00:45:47.940 align:start position:0%
that you just stated and I
 
00:45:49.849 --> 00:45:49.859 align:start position:0%
humbly put forward the recommendation
 
00:45:52.190 --> 00:45:52.200 align:start position:0%
that we start
 
00:45:54.230 --> 00:45:54.240 align:start position:0%
um in the middle
 
00:45:56.569 --> 00:45:56.579 align:start position:0%
kind of where everything is going right
 
00:45:59.329 --> 00:45:59.339 align:start position:0%
and we have two fit parents and we take
 
00:46:01.609 --> 00:46:01.619 align:start position:0%
the lead of six other states that have
 
00:46:04.609 --> 00:46:04.619 align:start position:0%
put forward equal parenting
 
00:46:07.910 --> 00:46:07.920 align:start position:0%
um and we look at that as a serious way
 
00:46:11.150 --> 00:46:11.160 align:start position:0%
of addressing at least that portion
 
00:46:13.309 --> 00:46:13.319 align:start position:0%
everything else that starts moving to
 
00:46:16.069 --> 00:46:16.079 align:start position:0%
the outskirts has to be dealt with but
 
00:46:18.170 --> 00:46:18.180 align:start position:0%
we need to start with the presumption
 
00:46:21.130 --> 00:46:21.140 align:start position:0%
that we're going to have 50 50 parenting
 
00:46:25.250 --> 00:46:25.260 align:start position:0%
when both parents are fit parents and I
 
00:46:27.410 --> 00:46:27.420 align:start position:0%
think that would help alleviate a lot of
 
00:46:29.450 --> 00:46:29.460 align:start position:0%
the animosities that tends to come into
 
00:46:31.510 --> 00:46:31.520 align:start position:0%
the courtroom when people are very
 
00:46:34.309 --> 00:46:34.319 align:start position:0%
afraid of losing their children access
 
00:46:37.790 --> 00:46:37.800 align:start position:0%
to their children but um respectfully I
 
00:46:40.130 --> 00:46:40.140 align:start position:0%
I would love to see a start at a center
 
00:46:42.230 --> 00:46:42.240 align:start position:0%
point and then start moving away but I
 
00:46:43.730 --> 00:46:43.740 align:start position:0%
do agree with you that the family court
 
00:46:45.650 --> 00:46:45.660 align:start position:0%
is responsible
 
00:46:48.470 --> 00:46:48.480 align:start position:0%
um for that portion and the other thing
 
00:46:51.710 --> 00:46:51.720 align:start position:0%
should be moved out to other agencies
 
00:46:57.770 --> 00:46:57.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:02.450 --> 00:47:02.460 align:start position:0%
we do now have 50 50 parenting is what
 
00:47:06.890 --> 00:47:06.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:11.990 --> 00:47:12.000 align:start position:0%
Marissa actually we have a try to make
 
00:47:14.930 --> 00:47:14.940 align:start position:0%
it as equal as possible and but it is
 
00:47:18.470 --> 00:47:18.480 align:start position:0%
not necessarily 50 50 and my experience
 
00:47:19.849 --> 00:47:19.859 align:start position:0%
has been
 
00:47:19.859 --> 00:47:20.990 align:start position:0%
has been
um

00:47:20.990 --> 00:47:21.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:24.650 --> 00:47:24.660 align:start position:0%
that in some courts it happens and in
 
00:47:26.809 --> 00:47:26.819 align:start position:0%
other courts it does not but it is not a
 
00:47:28.490 --> 00:47:28.500 align:start position:0%
guarantee that we start with a
 
00:47:31.309 --> 00:47:31.319 align:start position:0%
presumption of 50 50.
 
00:47:33.410 --> 00:47:33.420 align:start position:0%
so I actually asked that when we were in
 
00:47:35.329 --> 00:47:35.339 align:start position:0%
the Nashua Court specifically directly
 
00:47:37.609 --> 00:47:37.619 align:start position:0%
to the judges and they did state that
 
00:47:39.950 --> 00:47:39.960 align:start position:0%
typically they try and they consider
 
00:47:42.190 --> 00:47:42.200 align:start position:0%
what's in the best interest of the child
 
00:47:44.990 --> 00:47:45.000 align:start position:0%
and if you look at what the RSA is and
 
00:47:46.430 --> 00:47:46.440 align:start position:0%
they specifically said that they do not
 
00:47:48.290 --> 00:47:48.300 align:start position:0%
start with a presumption of 50 50 and
 
00:47:50.270 --> 00:47:50.280 align:start position:0%
this is directly from three judges at
 
00:47:52.130 --> 00:47:52.140 align:start position:0%
the Nashua court so if you look at the
 
00:47:53.930 --> 00:47:53.940 align:start position:0%
RSA it says in determining parental
 
00:47:55.790 --> 00:47:55.800 align:start position:0%
rights and responsibilities the the
 
00:47:57.290 --> 00:47:57.300 align:start position:0%
court shall be guided by the best
 
00:48:00.170 --> 00:48:00.180 align:start position:0%
interests of the child and when it goes
 
00:48:02.089 --> 00:48:02.099 align:start position:0%
into its it does say that like each
 
00:48:02.099 --> 00:48:03.589 align:start position:0%
into its it does say that like each
parent

00:48:03.589 --> 00:48:03.599 align:start position:0%
parent
 
00:48:03.599 --> 00:48:04.750 align:start position:0%
parent
um

00:48:04.750 --> 00:48:04.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:48:07.190 --> 00:48:07.200 align:start position:0%
shall have contact with they should
 
00:48:10.130 --> 00:48:10.140 align:start position:0%
promote allowing contact with each
 
00:48:11.690 --> 00:48:11.700 align:start position:0%
parent but it doesn't say anything about
 
00:48:14.329 --> 00:48:14.339 align:start position:0%
equal so I do think that there is a key
 
00:48:16.849 --> 00:48:16.859 align:start position:0%
difference in actually a presumption of
 
00:48:19.790 --> 00:48:19.800 align:start position:0%
equal Parenting Time versus just
 
00:48:21.950 --> 00:48:21.960 align:start position:0%
continued contact with each parent you
 
00:48:24.109 --> 00:48:24.119 align:start position:0%
know like an actual are we going to try
 
00:48:26.210 --> 00:48:26.220 align:start position:0%
and as reasonably as possible do 50 50
 
00:48:28.849 --> 00:48:28.859 align:start position:0%
verse is it just
 
00:48:30.650 --> 00:48:30.660 align:start position:0%
time with each parent I think there's a
 
00:48:32.630 --> 00:48:32.640 align:start position:0%
huge difference between that
 
00:48:37.630 --> 00:48:37.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:44.450 --> 00:48:44.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:45.890 --> 00:48:45.900 align:start position:0%
you should think I stand corrected what
 
00:48:48.829 --> 00:48:48.839 align:start position:0%
I what I think is I tell my I think what
 
00:48:50.829 --> 00:48:50.839 align:start position:0%
the court is is both parents are equally
 
00:48:53.870 --> 00:48:53.880 align:start position:0%
considered for being their parenting it
 
00:48:55.250 --> 00:48:55.260 align:start position:0%
doesn't start off so I think that you're
 
00:48:56.569 --> 00:48:56.579 align:start position:0%
right when the judges said no we don't
 
00:48:59.089 --> 00:48:59.099 align:start position:0%
start off at 50 50. we start with a flat
 
00:49:01.609 --> 00:49:01.619 align:start position:0%
flat slate and then we go but there's
 
00:49:04.250 --> 00:49:04.260 align:start position:0%
not a a bias that it should be anything
 
00:49:06.109 --> 00:49:06.119 align:start position:0%
but I I do think the presumption is both
 
00:49:09.069 --> 00:49:09.079 align:start position:0%
parents start out as equally fit to be
 
00:49:12.589 --> 00:49:12.599 align:start position:0%
parents so I think I probably overstated
 
00:49:15.050 --> 00:49:15.060 align:start position:0%
the 50 50 but
 
00:49:17.270 --> 00:49:17.280 align:start position:0%
representative Greg
 
00:49:19.010 --> 00:49:19.020 align:start position:0%
so that's one of those complications
 
00:49:20.569 --> 00:49:20.579 align:start position:0%
that we've talked oh sorry thank you
 
00:49:22.790 --> 00:49:22.800 align:start position:0%
madam chairman I always appreciate you
 
00:49:25.190 --> 00:49:25.200 align:start position:0%
sorry if you forget to say it
 
00:49:26.510 --> 00:49:26.520 align:start position:0%
um you know it's one of those things
 
00:49:28.490 --> 00:49:28.500 align:start position:0%
we've talked about a lot in children and
 
00:49:29.990 --> 00:49:30.000 align:start position:0%
family law because
 
00:49:32.150 --> 00:49:32.160 align:start position:0%
um it's it's something that certainly
 
00:49:34.190 --> 00:49:34.200 align:start position:0%
comes up the the dilemmas that we
 
00:49:35.690 --> 00:49:35.700 align:start position:0%
continue to hit is for a hundred
 
00:49:37.430 --> 00:49:37.440 align:start position:0%
families we have a hundred fluid
 
00:49:37.440 --> 00:49:39.050 align:start position:0%
families we have a hundred fluid
situations

00:49:39.050 --> 00:49:39.060 align:start position:0%
situations
 
00:49:41.329 --> 00:49:41.339 align:start position:0%
so to say that we're going to start with
 
00:49:43.370 --> 00:49:43.380 align:start position:0%
having this particular part of the
 
00:49:44.450 --> 00:49:44.460 align:start position:0%
puzzle we're going to try to throw
 
00:49:45.950 --> 00:49:45.960 align:start position:0%
everybody in this
 
00:49:48.349 --> 00:49:48.359 align:start position:0%
is complicated especially when there are
 
00:49:52.430 --> 00:49:52.440 align:start position:0%
so many things underlying in situations
 
00:49:53.630 --> 00:49:53.640 align:start position:0%
um you know I'm going to go back to
 
00:49:55.609 --> 00:49:55.619 align:start position:0%
abusive situations because we do have a
 
00:49:57.349 --> 00:49:57.359 align:start position:0%
high population that have domestic
 
00:50:00.290 --> 00:50:00.300 align:start position:0%
violence in our particular State and so
 
00:50:02.270 --> 00:50:02.280 align:start position:0%
you know when you go into things like
 
00:50:04.250 --> 00:50:04.260 align:start position:0%
that to say we're going to start with
 
00:50:04.260 --> 00:50:05.569 align:start position:0%
that to say we're going to start with
this

00:50:05.569 --> 00:50:05.579 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:50:07.370 --> 00:50:07.380 align:start position:0%
leads to a lot of different things we've
 
00:50:09.349 --> 00:50:09.359 align:start position:0%
heard from you know Waypoint we've heard
 
00:50:11.390 --> 00:50:11.400 align:start position:0%
from other things that that will
 
00:50:14.210 --> 00:50:14.220 align:start position:0%
actually keep some
 
00:50:16.190 --> 00:50:16.200 align:start position:0%
domestic violence victims in their
 
00:50:19.130 --> 00:50:19.140 align:start position:0%
situation thinking that well if this is
 
00:50:21.550 --> 00:50:21.560 align:start position:0%
on the books that it's 50 50 immediately
 
00:50:25.730 --> 00:50:25.740 align:start position:0%
and by the way I I've not come across
 
00:50:30.230 --> 00:50:30.240 align:start position:0%
one Survivor that doesn't think that you
 
00:50:31.250 --> 00:50:31.260 align:start position:0%
know they're going to lose their kids
 
00:50:32.510 --> 00:50:32.520 align:start position:0%
because they've been told that the
 
00:50:35.030 --> 00:50:35.040 align:start position:0%
entire time as soon as you go or that
 
00:50:36.770 --> 00:50:36.780 align:start position:0%
doesn't think I'm managing this at home
 
00:50:38.630 --> 00:50:38.640 align:start position:0%
right now as soon as they the other
 
00:50:40.490 --> 00:50:40.500 align:start position:0%
person can have the child without
 
00:50:42.829 --> 00:50:42.839 align:start position:0%
supervision what that does so that's
 
00:50:45.230 --> 00:50:45.240 align:start position:0%
just one complication representative
 
00:50:47.450 --> 00:50:47.460 align:start position:0%
long has brought up a really good point
 
00:50:50.329 --> 00:50:50.339 align:start position:0%
too when we start 50 50 what what does
 
00:50:52.250 --> 00:50:52.260 align:start position:0%
that look like equal parenting you know
 
00:50:54.049 --> 00:50:54.059 align:start position:0%
a lot of times the court says okay well
 
00:50:56.390 --> 00:50:56.400 align:start position:0%
it makes sense for them to be with you
 
00:50:58.910 --> 00:50:58.920 align:start position:0%
know one parent during the week because
 
00:51:00.950 --> 00:51:00.960 align:start position:0%
you know they're at school this is you
 
00:51:02.870 --> 00:51:02.880 align:start position:0%
know their routine and stuff so what
 
00:51:05.210 --> 00:51:05.220 align:start position:0%
would that look like 50 50 like three
 
00:51:06.950 --> 00:51:06.960 align:start position:0%
and a half days and all of a sudden they
 
00:51:08.750 --> 00:51:08.760 align:start position:0%
split it's just a it's one of those
 
00:51:10.849 --> 00:51:10.859 align:start position:0%
things that I think it sounds really
 
00:51:13.609 --> 00:51:13.619 align:start position:0%
good and we want parents especially well
 
00:51:16.069 --> 00:51:16.079 align:start position:0%
parents to have as much visitation as
 
00:51:19.130 --> 00:51:19.140 align:start position:0%
possible and I understand the reason to
 
00:51:20.870 --> 00:51:20.880 align:start position:0%
say it is because there are parents who
 
00:51:24.589 --> 00:51:24.599 align:start position:0%
have not had any contact but saying
 
00:51:26.450 --> 00:51:26.460 align:start position:0%
automatically like we have to do equal
 
00:51:28.970 --> 00:51:28.980 align:start position:0%
parenting mainly doesn't work in
 
00:51:30.650 --> 00:51:30.660 align:start position:0%
actuality because then you've got a
 
00:51:32.329 --> 00:51:32.339 align:start position:0%
parent that maybe goes to work at five
 
00:51:33.950 --> 00:51:33.960 align:start position:0%
in the morning so what does that mean
 
00:51:35.930 --> 00:51:35.940 align:start position:0%
the child has to get up because it's 50
 
00:51:38.809 --> 00:51:38.819 align:start position:0%
50 we have to have 50 50 then that child
 
00:51:40.970 --> 00:51:40.980 align:start position:0%
gets up it's just complicated like it's
 
00:51:43.069 --> 00:51:43.079 align:start position:0%
one of those things that I think by
 
00:51:46.849 --> 00:51:46.859 align:start position:0%
fixing a few situations we can make a
 
00:51:46.859 --> 00:51:47.809 align:start position:0%
fixing a few situations we can make a
massive

00:51:47.809 --> 00:51:47.819 align:start position:0%
massive
 
00:51:47.819 --> 00:51:48.650 align:start position:0%
massive
um

00:51:48.650 --> 00:51:48.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:51:51.710 --> 00:51:51.720 align:start position:0%
uh we would we would regress on other
 
00:51:54.049 --> 00:51:54.059 align:start position:0%
situations because it because it sets
 
00:51:56.329 --> 00:51:56.339 align:start position:0%
set up there so it's just very
 
00:51:58.130 --> 00:51:58.140 align:start position:0%
complicated to put something that black
 
00:52:01.430 --> 00:52:01.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:01.440 --> 00:52:04.309 align:start position:0%
 
representative

00:52:04.309 --> 00:52:04.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:06.589 --> 00:52:06.599 align:start position:0%
thank you so I wanted to kind of go
 
00:52:08.030 --> 00:52:08.040 align:start position:0%
through like a list of ideas that I had
 
00:52:10.309 --> 00:52:10.319 align:start position:0%
and I do want to circling back to the 50
 
00:52:12.530 --> 00:52:12.540 align:start position:0%
50 custody thing I do think that if the
 
00:52:13.790 --> 00:52:13.800 align:start position:0%
presumption was that it was going to be
 
00:52:15.890 --> 00:52:15.900 align:start position:0%
50 50 unless the parents agreed
 
00:52:18.829 --> 00:52:18.839 align:start position:0%
otherwise I do think that there are a
 
00:52:20.390 --> 00:52:20.400 align:start position:0%
multitude of different situations and
 
00:52:21.770 --> 00:52:21.780 align:start position:0%
there would be parents that would come
 
00:52:23.569 --> 00:52:23.579 align:start position:0%
into it with an open mind that okay we
 
00:52:25.069 --> 00:52:25.079 align:start position:0%
need to do what's best for our kiddos
 
00:52:26.690 --> 00:52:26.700 align:start position:0%
because we know that the presumption is
 
00:52:29.390 --> 00:52:29.400 align:start position:0%
going to be equal parenting time but I
 
00:52:32.690 --> 00:52:32.700 align:start position:0%
have you know an a
 
00:52:36.109 --> 00:52:36.119 align:start position:0%
a 3 to 11 shift and the other parent has
 
00:52:37.790 --> 00:52:37.800 align:start position:0%
some other shift I think that they would
 
00:52:39.530 --> 00:52:39.540 align:start position:0%
come up to what works and makes sense
 
00:52:41.270 --> 00:52:41.280 align:start position:0%
for their own family I really think that
 
00:52:43.490 --> 00:52:43.500 align:start position:0%
there would be more people that would
 
00:52:45.710 --> 00:52:45.720 align:start position:0%
come together to figure out what would
 
00:52:48.410 --> 00:52:48.420 align:start position:0%
work for their family if it wasn't so
 
00:52:50.870 --> 00:52:50.880 align:start position:0%
much of just fighting to get any time
 
00:52:52.670 --> 00:52:52.680 align:start position:0%
but it was okay we're so we're gonna
 
00:52:54.290 --> 00:52:54.300 align:start position:0%
have equal time how can we actually make
 
00:52:56.150 --> 00:52:56.160 align:start position:0%
this work with our work schedules so I
 
00:52:58.190 --> 00:52:58.200 align:start position:0%
do think a presumption of equal time
 
00:53:00.490 --> 00:53:00.500 align:start position:0%
would actually lead to the parents
 
00:53:04.849 --> 00:53:04.859 align:start position:0%
working through things more I also think
 
00:53:07.430 --> 00:53:07.440 align:start position:0%
um if the child support were to be fixed
 
00:53:09.230 --> 00:53:09.240 align:start position:0%
that that would be really helpful right
 
00:53:12.470 --> 00:53:12.480 align:start position:0%
now there can't be like any kind of the
 
00:53:14.390 --> 00:53:14.400 align:start position:0%
guidelines are not really
 
00:53:17.450 --> 00:53:17.460 align:start position:0%
in a way that's workable so I think if
 
00:53:21.230 --> 00:53:21.240 align:start position:0%
if if one parent is being ordered to pay
 
00:53:22.970 --> 00:53:22.980 align:start position:0%
more you can't just because there's more
 
00:53:24.470 --> 00:53:24.480 align:start position:0%
parenting time even with another parent
 
00:53:25.790 --> 00:53:25.800 align:start position:0%
it doesn't mean that that other parent
 
00:53:29.270 --> 00:53:29.280 align:start position:0%
has to pay less I think to me what would
 
00:53:30.890 --> 00:53:30.900 align:start position:0%
be fair is when you do up these child
 
00:53:33.770 --> 00:53:33.780 align:start position:0%
support worksheets if Say What You Know
 
00:53:35.990 --> 00:53:36.000 align:start position:0%
parent a it says the cost to raise a
 
00:53:37.370 --> 00:53:37.380 align:start position:0%
child is three thousand dollars and
 
00:53:39.230 --> 00:53:39.240 align:start position:0%
parent B the cost to raise a child is
 
00:53:40.849 --> 00:53:40.859 align:start position:0%
one thousand dollars you take the
 
00:53:42.950 --> 00:53:42.960 align:start position:0%
difference and you split it in half so
 
00:53:44.690 --> 00:53:44.700 align:start position:0%
that means that each parent is now going
 
00:53:46.190 --> 00:53:46.200 align:start position:0%
to have two thousand dollars to raise
 
00:53:47.510 --> 00:53:47.520 align:start position:0%
the child
 
00:53:49.730 --> 00:53:49.740 align:start position:0%
if you just take the difference and you
 
00:53:51.530 --> 00:53:51.540 align:start position:0%
say Okay parent a is three thousand
 
00:53:54.290 --> 00:53:54.300 align:start position:0%
parent B is 1000 and you take the two
 
00:53:55.970 --> 00:53:55.980 align:start position:0%
thousand then you've got parent B having
 
00:53:58.069 --> 00:53:58.079 align:start position:0%
three thousand in parent a now only has
 
00:53:59.630 --> 00:53:59.640 align:start position:0%
one thousand so I think we do need to
 
00:54:02.750 --> 00:54:02.760 align:start position:0%
consider those guidelines I think
 
00:54:04.790 --> 00:54:04.800 align:start position:0%
um also we sh another area that we
 
00:54:06.230 --> 00:54:06.240 align:start position:0%
should really take a look at is
 
00:54:08.450 --> 00:54:08.460 align:start position:0%
timelines so we have timelines for some
 
00:54:10.790 --> 00:54:10.800 align:start position:0%
things and not timelines for others and
 
00:54:12.410 --> 00:54:12.420 align:start position:0%
I think if we had a more clear picture
 
00:54:15.710 --> 00:54:15.720 align:start position:0%
of of having timelines for things
 
00:54:17.750 --> 00:54:17.760 align:start position:0%
it would be better I know we just
 
00:54:23.329 --> 00:54:23.339 align:start position:0%
expanded under SB 180 is it 189 or 129
 
00:54:26.990 --> 00:54:27.000 align:start position:0%
um mediation for those who can't afford
 
00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:28.130 align:start position:0%
um mediation for those who can't afford
it

00:54:28.130 --> 00:54:28.140 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:54:31.549 --> 00:54:31.559 align:start position:0%
um and I do think if we had kind of some
 
00:54:34.490 --> 00:54:34.500 align:start position:0%
better timelines in place
 
00:54:36.290 --> 00:54:36.300 align:start position:0%
we might be able to work through things
 
00:54:38.750 --> 00:54:38.760 align:start position:0%
the other thing that might be nice for
 
00:54:40.549 --> 00:54:40.559 align:start position:0%
us to look into a little bit is is
 
00:54:42.829 --> 00:54:42.839 align:start position:0%
expanding the neutral case evaluation I
 
00:54:44.690 --> 00:54:44.700 align:start position:0%
know that's currently only offered in
 
00:54:47.690 --> 00:54:47.700 align:start position:0%
Concord I think if it were offered a bit
 
00:54:50.270 --> 00:54:50.280 align:start position:0%
in a bit wider net again like I think
 
00:54:52.370 --> 00:54:52.380 align:start position:0%
nobody knows what's best for your family
 
00:54:54.290 --> 00:54:54.300 align:start position:0%
than your own family you know what's
 
00:54:56.270 --> 00:54:56.280 align:start position:0%
what your children do what activities
 
00:54:58.309 --> 00:54:58.319 align:start position:0%
that you have what schedules that the
 
00:55:00.530 --> 00:55:00.540 align:start position:0%
parents have and so if they knew like
 
00:55:00.540 --> 00:55:02.510 align:start position:0%
parents have and so if they knew like
hey

00:55:02.510 --> 00:55:02.520 align:start position:0%
hey
 
00:55:04.370 --> 00:55:04.380 align:start position:0%
if if you're going to go to court then
 
00:55:06.410 --> 00:55:06.420 align:start position:0%
the the judge is going to decide and
 
00:55:07.970 --> 00:55:07.980 align:start position:0%
nobody's going to be a winner because he
 
00:55:09.650 --> 00:55:09.660 align:start position:0%
doesn't know all these intricate details
 
00:55:11.150 --> 00:55:11.160 align:start position:0%
of your family let's try and work this
 
00:55:12.410 --> 00:55:12.420 align:start position:0%
out and you've kind of got the neutral
 
00:55:14.690 --> 00:55:14.700 align:start position:0%
case evaluator saying well if you go to
 
00:55:16.430 --> 00:55:16.440 align:start position:0%
court like no you're not going to get
 
00:55:17.750 --> 00:55:17.760 align:start position:0%
your whole list and you're not going to
 
00:55:19.309 --> 00:55:19.319 align:start position:0%
get it either and it might be bits and
 
00:55:20.990 --> 00:55:21.000 align:start position:0%
pieces that weren't even priorities for
 
00:55:22.490 --> 00:55:22.500 align:start position:0%
either of you so let's just try and work
 
00:55:25.069 --> 00:55:25.079 align:start position:0%
it out together so I think you know that
 
00:55:27.109 --> 00:55:27.119 align:start position:0%
is one piece that I'd also like to look
 
00:55:27.119 --> 00:55:28.670 align:start position:0%
is one piece that I'd also like to look
into

00:55:28.670 --> 00:55:28.680 align:start position:0%
into
 
00:55:31.309 --> 00:55:31.319 align:start position:0%
um and then I'd also within the the
 
00:55:33.049 --> 00:55:33.059 align:start position:0%
timelines as well like kind of circling
 
00:55:34.849 --> 00:55:34.859 align:start position:0%
back with that like I think if there
 
00:55:37.069 --> 00:55:37.079 align:start position:0%
were if we did go back to that one judge
 
00:55:39.890 --> 00:55:39.900 align:start position:0%
one family that it really would
 
00:55:43.069 --> 00:55:43.079 align:start position:0%
help a lot I think where the timelines
 
00:55:45.410 --> 00:55:45.420 align:start position:0%
are so spread out right now where you
 
00:55:46.609 --> 00:55:46.619 align:start position:0%
know we've got some things that are
 
00:55:47.809 --> 00:55:47.819 align:start position:0%
required to be done with a certain
 
00:55:49.250 --> 00:55:49.260 align:start position:0%
amount of time and then some that just
 
00:55:52.190 --> 00:55:52.200 align:start position:0%
have no end date in sight that
 
00:55:54.530 --> 00:55:54.540 align:start position:0%
judges are retiring or moving on to
 
00:55:57.890 --> 00:55:57.900 align:start position:0%
another office and then we've got a new
 
00:55:59.630 --> 00:55:59.640 align:start position:0%
judge coming in that is completely
 
00:56:01.490 --> 00:56:01.500 align:start position:0%
unfamiliar with what's going on with the
 
00:56:04.430 --> 00:56:04.440 align:start position:0%
case and
 
00:56:06.410 --> 00:56:06.420 align:start position:0%
trying to read back through think about
 
00:56:08.450 --> 00:56:08.460 align:start position:0%
some of these families have gone in from
 
00:56:09.829 --> 00:56:09.839 align:start position:0%
motion after motion hearing after
 
00:56:12.290 --> 00:56:12.300 align:start position:0%
hearing to try and read through all that
 
00:56:13.910 --> 00:56:13.920 align:start position:0%
testimony and whatnot it's just not
 
00:56:15.589 --> 00:56:15.599 align:start position:0%
efficient for a judge to have to kind of
 
00:56:17.930 --> 00:56:17.940 align:start position:0%
read reread through all that so those
 
00:56:20.030 --> 00:56:20.040 align:start position:0%
would kind of really be my key areas
 
00:56:22.430 --> 00:56:22.440 align:start position:0%
that I would like to suggest
 
00:56:24.890 --> 00:56:24.900 align:start position:0%
thank you let me ask you a question
 
00:56:26.510 --> 00:56:26.520 align:start position:0%
about this
 
00:56:28.690 --> 00:56:28.700 align:start position:0%
um one judge one family
 
00:56:32.030 --> 00:56:32.040 align:start position:0%
one of the issues that
 
00:56:32.040 --> 00:56:33.410 align:start position:0%
one of the issues that
I

00:56:33.410 --> 00:56:33.420 align:start position:0%
I
 
00:56:37.569 --> 00:56:37.579 align:start position:0%
heard again and again as we listened to
 
00:56:42.890 --> 00:56:42.900 align:start position:0%
Witnesses was what seemed to me to be
 
00:56:42.900 --> 00:56:43.790 align:start position:0%
Witnesses was what seemed to me to be
um

00:56:43.790 --> 00:56:43.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:56:46.190 --> 00:56:46.200 align:start position:0%
a confusion
 
00:56:46.200 --> 00:56:48.470 align:start position:0%
a confusion
between

00:56:48.470 --> 00:56:48.480 align:start position:0%
between
 
00:56:48.480 --> 00:56:50.210 align:start position:0%
between
um

00:56:50.210 --> 00:56:50.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:56:54.950 --> 00:56:54.960 align:start position:0%
the domestic violence issues
 
00:56:57.950 --> 00:56:57.960 align:start position:0%
and those other issues that get you into
 
00:57:01.430 --> 00:57:01.440 align:start position:0%
Family Court we had people testifying
 
00:57:06.770 --> 00:57:06.780 align:start position:0%
who expressed their distress
 
00:57:08.270 --> 00:57:08.280 align:start position:0%
um about
 
00:57:08.280 --> 00:57:10.490 align:start position:0%
um about
uh

00:57:10.490 --> 00:57:10.500 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:57:14.390 --> 00:57:14.400 align:start position:0%
a decision that a judge made and then
 
00:57:18.230 --> 00:57:18.240 align:start position:0%
I realized it had nothing to do with the
 
00:57:21.650 --> 00:57:21.660 align:start position:0%
divorce proceedings it had to do with
 
00:57:27.010 --> 00:57:27.020 align:start position:0%
domestic violence and that the primary
 
00:57:27.020 --> 00:57:28.670 align:start position:0%
domestic violence and that the primary
participants

00:57:28.670 --> 00:57:28.680 align:start position:0%
participants
 
00:57:33.470 --> 00:57:33.480 align:start position:0%
didn't seem to understand the concept of
 
00:57:35.210 --> 00:57:35.220 align:start position:0%
the difference
 
00:57:38.930 --> 00:57:38.940 align:start position:0%
and jurisdiction and in responsibility
 
00:57:44.109 --> 00:57:44.119 align:start position:0%
between those two Avenues of the
 
00:57:47.089 --> 00:57:47.099 align:start position:0%
components of the judicial system
 
00:57:50.750 --> 00:57:50.760 align:start position:0%
so when you have
 
00:57:54.650 --> 00:57:54.660 align:start position:0%
um a particular family with issues of
 
00:57:57.650 --> 00:57:57.660 align:start position:0%
custody issues of
 
00:58:00.890 --> 00:58:00.900 align:start position:0%
of uh parenting issues of domestic
 
00:58:00.900 --> 00:58:02.410 align:start position:0%
of uh parenting issues of domestic
violence

00:58:02.410 --> 00:58:02.420 align:start position:0%
violence
 
00:58:08.809 --> 00:58:08.819 align:start position:0%
who's the lead judge and what is the um
 
00:58:12.829 --> 00:58:12.839 align:start position:0%
uh the determination about who
 
00:58:12.839 --> 00:58:14.870 align:start position:0%
uh the determination about who
follows

00:58:14.870 --> 00:58:14.880 align:start position:0%
follows
 
00:58:18.609 --> 00:58:18.619 align:start position:0%
given also the fact that the judges act
 
00:58:22.010 --> 00:58:22.020 align:start position:0%
not necessarily regularly but certainly
 
00:58:23.930 --> 00:58:23.940 align:start position:0%
do act as if they were circuit judges
 
00:58:27.530 --> 00:58:27.540 align:start position:0%
and so they moved from one Court to
 
00:58:27.540 --> 00:58:29.270 align:start position:0%
and so they moved from one Court to
another

00:58:29.270 --> 00:58:29.280 align:start position:0%
another
 
00:58:29.280 --> 00:58:30.950 align:start position:0%
another
um

00:58:30.950 --> 00:58:30.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:35.809 --> 00:58:35.819 align:start position:0%
so the ideal might be one judge
 
00:58:37.490 --> 00:58:37.500 align:start position:0%
one family
 
00:58:40.970 --> 00:58:40.980 align:start position:0%
but can that work in order for that to
 
00:58:43.069 --> 00:58:43.079 align:start position:0%
work in practice
 
00:58:46.370 --> 00:58:46.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:49.970 --> 00:58:49.980 align:start position:0%
by legislative action or do the courts
 
00:58:52.970 --> 00:58:52.980 align:start position:0%
have to change by judicial action
 
00:58:55.130 --> 00:58:55.140 align:start position:0%
the way
 
00:58:57.829 --> 00:58:57.839 align:start position:0%
um cases are assigned the way judges are
 
00:58:57.839 --> 00:58:59.630 align:start position:0%
um cases are assigned the way judges are
assigned

00:58:59.630 --> 00:58:59.640 align:start position:0%
assigned
 
00:59:03.530 --> 00:59:03.540 align:start position:0%
how do we how do we find our way into
 
00:59:05.750 --> 00:59:05.760 align:start position:0%
that gordian knot
 
00:59:07.490 --> 00:59:07.500 align:start position:0%
so I hear what you're saying
 
00:59:09.890 --> 00:59:09.900 align:start position:0%
representative and I think
 
00:59:11.569 --> 00:59:11.579 align:start position:0%
in theory
 
00:59:13.490 --> 00:59:13.500 align:start position:0%
it's terrific
 
00:59:17.329 --> 00:59:17.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:20.210 --> 00:59:20.220 align:start position:0%
so while we did hear about a lot of
 
00:59:22.910 --> 00:59:22.920 align:start position:0%
domestic violence cases here I think
 
00:59:25.849 --> 00:59:25.859 align:start position:0%
that the percentage that we heard from
 
00:59:28.190 --> 00:59:28.200 align:start position:0%
relating to is is much higher than what
 
00:59:31.250 --> 00:59:31.260 align:start position:0%
is actually in the court so I'm going to
 
00:59:32.569 --> 00:59:32.579 align:start position:0%
look to you if you remember off the top
 
00:59:35.450 --> 00:59:35.460 align:start position:0%
of your head attorney Pratt but I
 
00:59:36.530 --> 00:59:36.540 align:start position:0%
believe we were told that there was
 
00:59:41.930 --> 00:59:41.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:44.210 --> 00:59:44.220 align:start position:0%
I'm pretty sure it's roughly 30 000 and
 
00:59:46.970 --> 00:59:46.980 align:start position:0%
the number of divorce the domestic
 
00:59:48.829 --> 00:59:48.839 align:start position:0%
violence and stalking petitions that are
 
00:59:50.089 --> 00:59:50.099 align:start position:0%
filed per year
 
00:59:53.510 --> 00:59:53.520 align:start position:0%
is just shy of um six thousand and so
 
00:59:57.170 --> 00:59:57.180 align:start position:0%
even if all of those 6 000 were part of
 
00:59:58.849 --> 00:59:58.859 align:start position:0%
these thirty thousand divorce cases
 
01:00:02.690 --> 01:00:02.700 align:start position:0%
that's 20 and realistically not all of
 
01:00:04.370 --> 01:00:04.380 align:start position:0%
these are obviously part of divorce
 
01:00:05.990 --> 01:00:06.000 align:start position:0%
cases some of these are people that were
 
01:00:08.390 --> 01:00:08.400 align:start position:0%
not married and do not have children so
 
01:00:10.490 --> 01:00:10.500 align:start position:0%
while we did hear a great portion in
 
01:00:12.950 --> 01:00:12.960 align:start position:0%
here I think it's important to note that
 
01:00:15.609 --> 01:00:15.619 align:start position:0%
the majority of the cases don't involve
 
01:00:17.690 --> 01:00:17.700 align:start position:0%
domestic violence
 
01:00:20.809 --> 01:00:20.819 align:start position:0%
in them and I that and so from that
 
01:00:23.210 --> 01:00:23.220 align:start position:0%
perspective I just I do want to caution
 
01:00:25.430 --> 01:00:25.440 align:start position:0%
us on not although we've we've heard
 
01:00:27.230 --> 01:00:27.240 align:start position:0%
from a high percentage in this
 
01:00:28.730 --> 01:00:28.740 align:start position:0%
particular committee I do want to
 
01:00:30.410 --> 01:00:30.420 align:start position:0%
caution that I don't think that that's
 
01:00:32.870 --> 01:00:32.880 align:start position:0%
the general percentage and you may know
 
01:00:34.789 --> 01:00:34.799 align:start position:0%
better Macbeth
 
01:00:36.589 --> 01:00:36.599 align:start position:0%
actually I had a question for you uh
 
01:00:38.990 --> 01:00:39.000 align:start position:0%
representative catawb so what percentage
 
01:00:41.870 --> 01:00:41.880 align:start position:0%
of cases are not one case one judge
 
01:00:43.970 --> 01:00:43.980 align:start position:0%
because we've heard that here but again
 
01:00:45.829 --> 01:00:45.839 align:start position:0%
that isn't my experience my experience
 
01:00:47.210 --> 01:00:47.220 align:start position:0%
is the reason we have a different judge
 
01:00:48.230 --> 01:00:48.240 align:start position:0%
is because someone comes in with an
 
01:00:50.390 --> 01:00:50.400 align:start position:0%
emergency motion generally they are but
 
01:00:52.670 --> 01:00:52.680 align:start position:0%
I don't represent it I don't so do you
 
01:00:55.309 --> 01:00:55.319 align:start position:0%
have do you have statistics on how many
 
01:00:57.230 --> 01:00:57.240 align:start position:0%
people don't have one judge are we
 
01:00:58.370 --> 01:00:58.380 align:start position:0%
talking about the people that we've the
 
01:00:59.750 --> 01:00:59.760 align:start position:0%
witnesses we've heard from here
 
01:01:01.549 --> 01:01:01.559 align:start position:0%
certainly we've heard that here and I
 
01:01:04.549 --> 01:01:04.559 align:start position:0%
have two I'm not challenging that so I
 
01:01:05.990 --> 01:01:06.000 align:start position:0%
asked for some of that data there's a
 
01:01:07.430 --> 01:01:07.440 align:start position:0%
little bit of trouble with getting some
 
01:01:08.510 --> 01:01:08.520 align:start position:0%
of the data because some of the data
 
01:01:10.849 --> 01:01:10.859 align:start position:0%
they just don't have I did reach out to
 
01:01:12.650 --> 01:01:12.660 align:start position:0%
a few different family law attorneys
 
01:01:15.589 --> 01:01:15.599 align:start position:0%
that just are are friends of friends
 
01:01:17.510 --> 01:01:17.520 align:start position:0%
um and they did tell me that they've had
 
01:01:19.430 --> 01:01:19.440 align:start position:0%
quite a bit of turn off with going from
 
01:01:21.710 --> 01:01:21.720 align:start position:0%
with judges switching different
 
01:01:24.109 --> 01:01:24.119 align:start position:0%
um locations and with getting different
 
01:01:26.329 --> 01:01:26.339 align:start position:0%
judges they said that they would say
 
01:01:27.890 --> 01:01:27.900 align:start position:0%
even in about half of their cases
 
01:01:29.210 --> 01:01:29.220 align:start position:0%
they've ended up with a with a different
 
01:01:31.609 --> 01:01:31.619 align:start position:0%
judge pretty high percentage I don't
 
01:01:33.410 --> 01:01:33.420 align:start position:0%
know if you've maybe lucked out in one
 
01:01:35.329 --> 01:01:35.339 align:start position:0%
area where they didn't or and I'm
 
01:01:37.670 --> 01:01:37.680 align:start position:0%
wondering so I think that's that's very
 
01:01:38.690 --> 01:01:38.700 align:start position:0%
interesting so I think it'd be
 
01:01:42.230 --> 01:01:42.240 align:start position:0%
interesting to know if these um the why
 
01:01:44.630 --> 01:01:44.640 align:start position:0%
judges changed were they moved by the
 
01:01:46.970 --> 01:01:46.980 align:start position:0%
court because I know they reassigned or
 
01:01:50.329 --> 01:01:50.339 align:start position:0%
did they retire or or or was it just
 
01:01:52.910 --> 01:01:52.920 align:start position:0%
that's not the priority of that area and
 
01:01:54.770 --> 01:01:54.780 align:start position:0%
it would might also be interesting to
 
01:01:57.289 --> 01:01:57.299 align:start position:0%
know which areas are having problems
 
01:01:59.089 --> 01:01:59.099 align:start position:0%
with that because we they are
 
01:02:00.890 --> 01:02:00.900 align:start position:0%
um you know they're very close to the
 
01:02:02.390 --> 01:02:02.400 align:start position:0%
ground so they're very sensitive to
 
01:02:03.470 --> 01:02:03.480 align:start position:0%
what's their neighborhood their
 
01:02:05.270 --> 01:02:05.280 align:start position:0%
community so it would be interesting to
 
01:02:06.770 --> 01:02:06.780 align:start position:0%
know if there are certain you know if
 
01:02:09.049 --> 01:02:09.059 align:start position:0%
it's not happening in some places
 
01:02:11.089 --> 01:02:11.099 align:start position:0%
and how do we how do we change it is it
 
01:02:13.609 --> 01:02:13.619 align:start position:0%
more judges I mean we we talked to a
 
01:02:15.049 --> 01:02:15.059 align:start position:0%
judge and they're you know they don't
 
01:02:16.910 --> 01:02:16.920 align:start position:0%
have any writing time you know they're
 
01:02:20.809 --> 01:02:20.819 align:start position:0%
it's it's so you know for for them to
 
01:02:22.430 --> 01:02:22.440 align:start position:0%
get off the bench to rule on some cases
 
01:02:23.630 --> 01:02:23.640 align:start position:0%
you know if they're scheduled for things
 
01:02:25.730 --> 01:02:25.740 align:start position:0%
I mean it's just interesting how busy
 
01:02:27.410 --> 01:02:27.420 align:start position:0%
they are I don't know if you talk to
 
01:02:30.349 --> 01:02:30.359 align:start position:0%
your judges so is in order to have one
 
01:02:32.390 --> 01:02:32.400 align:start position:0%
job the one judge one case is it that we
 
01:02:34.849 --> 01:02:34.859 align:start position:0%
need to have the judges in the court
 
01:02:38.030 --> 01:02:38.040 align:start position:0%
house more time so that that judge is
 
01:02:41.270 --> 01:02:41.280 align:start position:0%
available when that case comes forward
 
01:02:43.370 --> 01:02:43.380 align:start position:0%
because that's generally my experience I
 
01:02:45.289 --> 01:02:45.299 align:start position:0%
have had cases that have had but
 
01:02:47.030 --> 01:02:47.040 align:start position:0%
generally it's when we didn't want to
 
01:02:49.130 --> 01:02:49.140 align:start position:0%
wait for them to get off vacation or you
 
01:02:55.569 --> 01:02:55.579 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:58.130 --> 01:02:58.140 align:start position:0%
the questions that you asked in the
 
01:02:59.750 --> 01:02:59.760 align:start position:0%
Family Division
 
01:03:04.630 --> 01:03:04.640 align:start position:0%
um in 22 2022 they had
 
01:03:08.990 --> 01:03:09.000 align:start position:0%
7054 divorce and parenting cases
 
01:03:13.430 --> 01:03:13.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:17.089 --> 01:03:17.099 align:start position:0%
domestic violence cases
 
01:03:19.569 --> 01:03:19.579 align:start position:0%
um then you know the the juvenile
 
01:03:23.150 --> 01:03:23.160 align:start position:0%
delinquency chins cases abuse and
 
01:03:23.160 --> 01:03:24.470 align:start position:0%
delinquency chins cases abuse and
neglect

01:03:24.470 --> 01:03:24.480 align:start position:0%
neglect
 
01:03:24.480 --> 01:03:25.130 align:start position:0%
neglect
um

01:03:25.130 --> 01:03:25.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:03:28.010 --> 01:03:28.020 align:start position:0%
uh guardianship of minors
 
01:03:31.010 --> 01:03:31.020 align:start position:0%
and the termination of parental rights
 
01:03:34.670 --> 01:03:34.680 align:start position:0%
the termination of parental rights is uh
 
01:03:34.680 --> 01:03:37.490 align:start position:0%
the termination of parental rights is uh
560

01:03:37.490 --> 01:03:37.500 align:start position:0%
560
 
01:03:37.500 --> 01:03:38.870 align:start position:0%
560
um

01:03:38.870 --> 01:03:38.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:03:38.880 --> 01:03:41.990 align:start position:0%
um
which

01:03:41.990 --> 01:03:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:47.030 --> 01:03:47.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:50.030 --> 01:03:50.040 align:start position:0%
that that that's a few
 
01:03:54.349 --> 01:03:54.359 align:start position:0%
cases of the most difficult and that are
 
01:03:56.630 --> 01:03:56.640 align:start position:0%
the most difficult
 
01:03:56.640 --> 01:03:58.010 align:start position:0%
the most difficult
um

01:03:58.010 --> 01:03:58.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:03:58.020 --> 01:03:59.990 align:start position:0%
um
but

01:03:59.990 --> 01:04:00.000 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:04:03.530 --> 01:04:03.540 align:start position:0%
one of the things that struck me is
 
01:04:03.540 --> 01:04:04.789 align:start position:0%
one of the things that struck me is
while

01:04:04.789 --> 01:04:04.799 align:start position:0%
while
 
01:04:08.930 --> 01:04:08.940 align:start position:0%
the budget that we just passed provides
 
01:04:12.109 --> 01:04:12.119 align:start position:0%
significant additional money
 
01:04:17.329 --> 01:04:17.339 align:start position:0%
for the courts that nonetheless
 
01:04:21.829 --> 01:04:21.839 align:start position:0%
um the uh the courts have
 
01:04:23.930 --> 01:04:23.940 align:start position:0%
um I think it's close to Ford or about
 
01:04:28.970 --> 01:04:28.980 align:start position:0%
40 positions now that are unfilled
 
01:04:28.980 --> 01:04:30.410 align:start position:0%
40 positions now that are unfilled
so

01:04:30.410 --> 01:04:30.420 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:04:30.420 --> 01:04:31.370 align:start position:0%
so
um

01:04:31.370 --> 01:04:31.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:04:33.829 --> 01:04:33.839 align:start position:0%
if if those positions alone were
 
01:04:37.010 --> 01:04:37.020 align:start position:0%
unfilled without the additional money
 
01:04:40.849 --> 01:04:40.859 align:start position:0%
it would make a significant difference
 
01:04:40.859 --> 01:04:41.510 align:start position:0%
it would make a significant difference
um

01:04:41.510 --> 01:04:41.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:04:45.190 --> 01:04:45.200 align:start position:0%
and certainly with the additional money
 
01:04:48.650 --> 01:04:48.660 align:start position:0%
it might mean that
 
01:04:48.660 --> 01:04:50.450 align:start position:0%
it might mean that
um

01:04:50.450 --> 01:04:50.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:04:53.270 --> 01:04:53.280 align:start position:0%
that some of the problems will have been
 
01:04:53.280 --> 01:04:55.030 align:start position:0%
that some of the problems will have been
addressed

01:04:55.030 --> 01:04:55.040 align:start position:0%
addressed
 
01:04:59.270 --> 01:04:59.280 align:start position:0%
I want to go back to something about
 
01:04:59.280 --> 01:05:03.170 align:start position:0%
I want to go back to something about
training

01:05:03.170 --> 01:05:03.180 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:06.049 --> 01:05:06.059 align:start position:0%
and supervision
 
01:05:09.289 --> 01:05:09.299 align:start position:0%
and accountability
 
01:05:09.299 --> 01:05:13.130 align:start position:0%
and accountability
um

01:05:13.130 --> 01:05:13.140 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:17.270 --> 01:05:17.280 align:start position:0%
the training that is offered uh
 
01:05:21.490 --> 01:05:21.500 align:start position:0%
is once a year there's access to very
 
01:05:25.730 --> 01:05:25.740 align:start position:0%
solid National Training
 
01:05:25.740 --> 01:05:27.410 align:start position:0%
solid National Training
um

01:05:27.410 --> 01:05:27.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:05:30.950 --> 01:05:30.960 align:start position:0%
but when you look at the judges who are
 
01:05:30.960 --> 01:05:33.710 align:start position:0%
but when you look at the judges who are
appointed

01:05:33.710 --> 01:05:33.720 align:start position:0%
appointed
 
01:05:37.609 --> 01:05:37.619 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:41.750 --> 01:05:41.760 align:start position:0%
have had experience in the family court
 
01:05:46.370 --> 01:05:46.380 align:start position:0%
they have had experience in other
 
01:05:50.210 --> 01:05:50.220 align:start position:0%
other in other courts Perhaps Perhaps
 
01:05:53.329 --> 01:05:53.339 align:start position:0%
not some people get appointed having had
 
01:05:55.309 --> 01:05:55.319 align:start position:0%
no experience in any courts at all
 
01:05:58.789 --> 01:05:58.799 align:start position:0%
because most of the work that lawyers do
 
01:06:01.250 --> 01:06:01.260 align:start position:0%
doesn't involve courts although we don't
 
01:06:03.349 --> 01:06:03.359 align:start position:0%
think of that because we just think of
 
01:06:06.049 --> 01:06:06.059 align:start position:0%
how things are shown on television
 
01:06:06.059 --> 01:06:06.950 align:start position:0%
how things are shown on television
um

01:06:06.950 --> 01:06:06.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:09.950 --> 01:06:09.960 align:start position:0%
so you get somebody who has no
 
01:06:12.829 --> 01:06:12.839 align:start position:0%
experience with family court we all know
 
01:06:15.109 --> 01:06:15.119 align:start position:0%
how we struggle with how complex the
 
01:06:18.130 --> 01:06:18.140 align:start position:0%
laws are how they change
 
01:06:21.230 --> 01:06:21.240 align:start position:0%
how they're interpreted
 
01:06:22.970 --> 01:06:22.980 align:start position:0%
um uh
 
01:06:26.809 --> 01:06:26.819 align:start position:0%
if they have a a week
 
01:06:28.849 --> 01:06:28.859 align:start position:0%
of training
 
01:06:30.650 --> 01:06:30.660 align:start position:0%
and then there
 
01:06:34.970 --> 01:06:34.980 align:start position:0%
dropped in a court with a long
 
01:06:34.980 --> 01:06:37.910 align:start position:0%
dropped in a court with a long
caseload

01:06:37.910 --> 01:06:37.920 align:start position:0%
caseload
 
01:06:40.190 --> 01:06:40.200 align:start position:0%
what do we expect
 
01:06:41.710 --> 01:06:41.720 align:start position:0%
I mean
 
01:06:44.569 --> 01:06:44.579 align:start position:0%
what what do we expect of somebody who's
 
01:06:46.970 --> 01:06:46.980 align:start position:0%
dropped in an alien culture and doesn't
 
01:06:48.770 --> 01:06:48.780 align:start position:0%
speak the language
 
01:06:50.569 --> 01:06:50.579 align:start position:0%
uh and
 
01:06:54.289 --> 01:06:54.299 align:start position:0%
that is something that is a real concern
 
01:06:56.809 --> 01:06:56.819 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:59.210 --> 01:06:59.220 align:start position:0%
the executive branch is the branch
 
01:07:00.670 --> 01:07:00.680 align:start position:0%
that's involved
 
01:07:03.710 --> 01:07:03.720 align:start position:0%
in the appointment and we haven't talked
 
01:07:05.569 --> 01:07:05.579 align:start position:0%
about the executive Branch's role in
 
01:07:08.569 --> 01:07:08.579 align:start position:0%
this at all but that is obviously
 
01:07:11.029 --> 01:07:11.039 align:start position:0%
they're at the Starting Gate they they
 
01:07:13.490 --> 01:07:13.500 align:start position:0%
are at the Starting Gate for who in fact
 
01:07:15.589 --> 01:07:15.599 align:start position:0%
sits on the bench
 
01:07:19.910 --> 01:07:19.920 align:start position:0%
and then we put these
 
01:07:22.849 --> 01:07:22.859 align:start position:0%
Earnest capable
 
01:07:25.789 --> 01:07:25.799 align:start position:0%
committed people in the court
 
01:07:28.670 --> 01:07:28.680 align:start position:0%
who who don't speak the language
 
01:07:31.190 --> 01:07:31.200 align:start position:0%
what do we do then how do we train them
 
01:07:35.410 --> 01:07:35.420 align:start position:0%
how to how do we provide
 
01:07:38.770 --> 01:07:38.780 align:start position:0%
supervision how do we provide
 
01:07:43.089 --> 01:07:43.099 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:47.210 --> 01:07:47.220 align:start position:0%
that whole piece is something that to me
 
01:07:50.329 --> 01:07:50.339 align:start position:0%
is very important did I see your hand
 
01:07:52.010 --> 01:07:52.020 align:start position:0%
represented long because you're more
 
01:07:54.349 --> 01:07:54.359 align:start position:0%
knowledgeable than I am about this no I
 
01:07:56.089 --> 01:07:56.099 align:start position:0%
I actually that is one of the questions
 
01:07:57.950 --> 01:07:57.960 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair that is one of the
 
01:08:00.109 --> 01:08:00.119 align:start position:0%
questions I ask
 
01:08:00.119 --> 01:08:00.950 align:start position:0%
questions I ask
um

01:08:00.950 --> 01:08:00.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:03.650 --> 01:08:03.660 align:start position:0%
um you know and I saw the two people
 
01:08:06.289 --> 01:08:06.299 align:start position:0%
that I've asked the question two faces
 
01:08:08.809 --> 01:08:08.819 align:start position:0%
get uncomfortable uh because I said that
 
01:08:11.270 --> 01:08:11.280 align:start position:0%
it you know is at political appointments
 
01:08:13.730 --> 01:08:13.740 align:start position:0%
is that the issue you know I'm just
 
01:08:15.829 --> 01:08:15.839 align:start position:0%
trying to get to the bottom line of why
 
01:08:18.590 --> 01:08:18.600 align:start position:0%
this is all happening
 
01:08:18.600 --> 01:08:19.490 align:start position:0%
this is all happening
um

01:08:19.490 --> 01:08:19.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:23.570 --> 01:08:23.580 align:start position:0%
there is training by a for a week
 
01:08:27.709 --> 01:08:27.719 align:start position:0%
by a National Association somewhere in
 
01:08:30.410 --> 01:08:30.420 align:start position:0%
the country okay
 
01:08:33.530 --> 01:08:33.540 align:start position:0%
um if they all could make it so
 
01:08:36.829 --> 01:08:36.839 align:start position:0%
they they don't all make it uh so so
 
01:08:39.050 --> 01:08:39.060 align:start position:0%
that was one of the issues um but but
 
01:08:40.970 --> 01:08:40.980 align:start position:0%
with all this discussion
 
01:08:43.490 --> 01:08:43.500 align:start position:0%
what I look for is
 
01:08:46.130 --> 01:08:46.140 align:start position:0%
um a reducing Conflict for example the
 
01:08:48.590 --> 01:08:48.600 align:start position:0%
presumption of equal parenting that'll
 
01:08:51.890 --> 01:08:51.900 align:start position:0%
clearly reduce conflict because I'm not
 
01:08:54.829 --> 01:08:54.839 align:start position:0%
fighting to see my child to how much I'm
 
01:08:57.829 --> 01:08:57.839 align:start position:0%
not gonna pay you know I mean is is it
 
01:09:00.050 --> 01:09:00.060 align:start position:0%
complicated absolutely is because I
 
01:09:02.930 --> 01:09:02.940 align:start position:0%
could see people fighting over yeah I
 
01:09:04.370 --> 01:09:04.380 align:start position:0%
want equal parenting because I'm going
 
01:09:05.450 --> 01:09:05.460 align:start position:0%
to pay less
 
01:09:09.349 --> 01:09:09.359 align:start position:0%
right uh it's not you know we hear we
 
01:09:12.110 --> 01:09:12.120 align:start position:0%
heard a lot of testimony
 
01:09:14.689 --> 01:09:14.699 align:start position:0%
um that they felt like winners or losers
 
01:09:16.789 --> 01:09:16.799 align:start position:0%
you know and we got to turn that into
 
01:09:19.550 --> 01:09:19.560 align:start position:0%
the child you know is the child the
 
01:09:22.189 --> 01:09:22.199 align:start position:0%
winner or loser so reducing conflict
 
01:09:24.110 --> 01:09:24.120 align:start position:0%
when I had children of family law when I
 
01:09:26.689 --> 01:09:26.699 align:start position:0%
look at a bill I look for that I look to
 
01:09:29.990 --> 01:09:30.000 align:start position:0%
see if this will reduce or add conflict
 
01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:30.890 align:start position:0%
see if this will reduce or add conflict
um

01:09:30.890 --> 01:09:30.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:09:33.169 --> 01:09:33.179 align:start position:0%
so these are all equal parenting is
 
01:09:33.179 --> 01:09:34.189 align:start position:0%
so these are all equal parenting is
great

01:09:34.189 --> 01:09:34.199 align:start position:0%
great
 
01:09:37.070 --> 01:09:37.080 align:start position:0%
um you know the the timeline I think is
 
01:09:40.490 --> 01:09:40.500 align:start position:0%
is fantastic knowing that
 
01:09:43.490 --> 01:09:43.500 align:start position:0%
you know my ex can't drag this on
 
01:09:43.500 --> 01:09:44.630 align:start position:0%
you know my ex can't drag this on
forever

01:09:44.630 --> 01:09:44.640 align:start position:0%
forever
 
01:09:46.610 --> 01:09:46.620 align:start position:0%
you know I gotta stop paying for an
 
01:09:49.610 --> 01:09:49.620 align:start position:0%
attorney and go pro se
 
01:09:51.470 --> 01:09:51.480 align:start position:0%
um I I'd like the neutral case
 
01:09:51.480 --> 01:09:52.689 align:start position:0%
um I I'd like the neutral case
evaluation

01:09:52.689 --> 01:09:52.699 align:start position:0%
evaluation
 
01:09:56.030 --> 01:09:56.040 align:start position:0%
uh everything we do is going to be
 
01:09:58.610 --> 01:09:58.620 align:start position:0%
complicated you know but we need to do
 
01:10:01.910 --> 01:10:01.920 align:start position:0%
something and then work on you know
 
01:10:05.090 --> 01:10:05.100 align:start position:0%
because these the conflict cases are
 
01:10:08.330 --> 01:10:08.340 align:start position:0%
are smaller than you know there's I
 
01:10:10.430 --> 01:10:10.440 align:start position:0%
don't know 70 percent of the cases that
 
01:10:12.890 --> 01:10:12.900 align:start position:0%
come through where you could get in
 
01:10:16.070 --> 01:10:16.080 align:start position:0%
agreement with both parties uh is
 
01:10:18.110 --> 01:10:18.120 align:start position:0%
what I remember
 
01:10:21.410 --> 01:10:21.420 align:start position:0%
um you know so then you address the the
 
01:10:24.050 --> 01:10:24.060 align:start position:0%
complicated cases I remember judge uh
 
01:10:25.850 --> 01:10:25.860 align:start position:0%
Foley coming before Children and
 
01:10:27.229 --> 01:10:27.239 align:start position:0%
Families saying
 
01:10:30.830 --> 01:10:30.840 align:start position:0%
whenever I get a uh a conflict case
 
01:10:33.410 --> 01:10:33.420 align:start position:0%
I said what I said with the two parties
 
01:10:34.729 --> 01:10:34.739 align:start position:0%
and I say
 
01:10:37.669 --> 01:10:37.679 align:start position:0%
um you do realize that because you can't
 
01:10:41.030 --> 01:10:41.040 align:start position:0%
agree on something I'm gonna have to
 
01:10:42.649 --> 01:10:42.659 align:start position:0%
make that choice and want to use not
 
01:10:44.149 --> 01:10:44.159 align:start position:0%
gonna like that choice
 
01:10:47.149 --> 01:10:47.159 align:start position:0%
you know and I thought that that was
 
01:10:49.130 --> 01:10:49.140 align:start position:0%
good you know the more
 
01:10:52.070 --> 01:10:52.080 align:start position:0%
parents could get together with the best
 
01:10:54.410 --> 01:10:54.420 align:start position:0%
interests of the child and not
 
01:10:56.450 --> 01:10:56.460 align:start position:0%
one-up each other
 
01:10:59.330 --> 01:10:59.340 align:start position:0%
you know that's that's what we look for
 
01:11:01.610 --> 01:11:01.620 align:start position:0%
um and I and I think all of these in
 
01:11:05.750 --> 01:11:05.760 align:start position:0%
some form need need to be uh you know
 
01:11:08.870 --> 01:11:08.880 align:start position:0%
need to needs to come to the surface and
 
01:11:11.450 --> 01:11:11.460 align:start position:0%
then work on addressing the
 
01:11:11.460 --> 01:11:13.430 align:start position:0%
then work on addressing the
complications

01:11:13.430 --> 01:11:13.440 align:start position:0%
complications
 
01:11:13.440 --> 01:11:14.149 align:start position:0%
complications
um

01:11:14.149 --> 01:11:14.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:11:14.159 --> 01:11:16.430 align:start position:0%
um
uh

01:11:16.430 --> 01:11:16.440 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:11:18.890 --> 01:11:18.900 align:start position:0%
yeah you know and the same with
 
01:11:20.870 --> 01:11:20.880 align:start position:0%
supervised visitation I I think
 
01:11:23.570 --> 01:11:23.580 align:start position:0%
representative Macbeth said it best that
 
01:11:26.030 --> 01:11:26.040 align:start position:0%
these supervised visitations are
 
01:11:28.189 --> 01:11:28.199 align:start position:0%
testimony that we heard of parents not
 
01:11:30.169 --> 01:11:30.179 align:start position:0%
seeing their child for a year or two
 
01:11:32.030 --> 01:11:32.040 align:start position:0%
years six months
 
01:11:33.950 --> 01:11:33.960 align:start position:0%
why because
 
01:11:37.550 --> 01:11:37.560 align:start position:0%
they had a Dewey and the other parents
 
01:11:39.590 --> 01:11:39.600 align:start position:0%
saying when I drop them off he looks
 
01:11:42.350 --> 01:11:42.360 align:start position:0%
like he's drunk so as a judge and you
 
01:11:44.330 --> 01:11:44.340 align:start position:0%
know you're thinking okay that's a
 
01:11:46.669 --> 01:11:46.679 align:start position:0%
liability for me if I allow that child
 
01:11:48.130 --> 01:11:48.140 align:start position:0%
to visit
 
01:11:50.870 --> 01:11:50.880 align:start position:0%
knowing that the person is an active
 
01:11:50.880 --> 01:11:52.370 align:start position:0%
knowing that the person is an active
Drinker

01:11:52.370 --> 01:11:52.380 align:start position:0%
Drinker
 
01:11:54.290 --> 01:11:54.300 align:start position:0%
um so these supervised visitations
 
01:11:56.390 --> 01:11:56.400 align:start position:0%
during that period where they're trying
 
01:11:58.370 --> 01:11:58.380 align:start position:0%
to figure that stuff out
 
01:12:01.430 --> 01:12:01.440 align:start position:0%
this is where these are used you know so
 
01:12:02.630 --> 01:12:02.640 align:start position:0%
they don't
 
01:12:05.270 --> 01:12:05.280 align:start position:0%
so they don't stop for a year or two
 
01:12:08.750 --> 01:12:08.760 align:start position:0%
years or longer
 
01:12:11.209 --> 01:12:11.219 align:start position:0%
so I think everything that has been
 
01:12:13.370 --> 01:12:13.380 align:start position:0%
brought to the table
 
01:12:13.380 --> 01:12:14.510 align:start position:0%
brought to the table
um

01:12:14.510 --> 01:12:14.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:12:16.910 --> 01:12:16.920 align:start position:0%
is quite a bit for the summer friends to
 
01:12:19.310 --> 01:12:19.320 align:start position:0%
be working on I just I just also wanted
 
01:12:23.330 --> 01:12:23.340 align:start position:0%
to say uh the staff issue I I was blown
 
01:12:26.990 --> 01:12:27.000 align:start position:0%
away by visiting Laconia I was blown
 
01:12:31.189 --> 01:12:31.199 align:start position:0%
away by the lack of employees you know I
 
01:12:33.709 --> 01:12:33.719 align:start position:0%
mean the seven judges may help
 
01:12:35.630 --> 01:12:35.640 align:start position:0%
but you know they're staff workers
 
01:12:38.930 --> 01:12:38.940 align:start position:0%
they're making 16 an hour with Stacks
 
01:12:41.030 --> 01:12:41.040 align:start position:0%
and stacks of cases that they gotta
 
01:12:43.070 --> 01:12:43.080 align:start position:0%
review type up
 
01:12:46.130 --> 01:12:46.140 align:start position:0%
I'm like how does this happen so so I
 
01:12:48.590 --> 01:12:48.600 align:start position:0%
could see a bottleneck
 
01:12:51.169 --> 01:12:51.179 align:start position:0%
um that complicates that creates more
 
01:12:53.510 --> 01:12:53.520 align:start position:0%
conflict I think
 
01:12:56.810 --> 01:12:56.820 align:start position:0%
um so you know a serious look at
 
01:12:59.390 --> 01:12:59.400 align:start position:0%
the financial standings of the judicial
 
01:13:07.010 --> 01:13:07.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:07.020 --> 01:13:09.590 align:start position:0%
 
representative

01:13:09.590 --> 01:13:09.600 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:13:12.709 --> 01:13:12.719 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry one issue that is dovetails
 
01:13:14.030 --> 01:13:14.040 align:start position:0%
into this but that I really see
 
01:13:15.890 --> 01:13:15.900 align:start position:0%
significant is the number and the
 
01:13:18.290 --> 01:13:18.300 align:start position:0%
increasing number of pro se parties and
 
01:13:20.450 --> 01:13:20.460 align:start position:0%
that ties in also I think with the lack
 
01:13:22.970 --> 01:13:22.980 align:start position:0%
of staff at the window to provide
 
01:13:22.980 --> 01:13:24.649 align:start position:0%
of staff at the window to provide
adequate

01:13:24.649 --> 01:13:24.659 align:start position:0%
adequate
 
01:13:26.450 --> 01:13:26.460 align:start position:0%
um again they're not allowed to provide
 
01:13:29.270 --> 01:13:29.280 align:start position:0%
legal that's what I know but but just
 
01:13:30.950 --> 01:13:30.960 align:start position:0%
that they're not so overwhelmed that
 
01:13:33.050 --> 01:13:33.060 align:start position:0%
they can't provide the forms or the list
 
01:13:34.850 --> 01:13:34.860 align:start position:0%
I know that the courts we saw they have
 
01:13:36.350 --> 01:13:36.360 align:start position:0%
you know really good this is these are
 
01:13:38.030 --> 01:13:38.040 align:start position:0%
the forms you need you know you need to
 
01:13:40.010 --> 01:13:40.020 align:start position:0%
feel these out but you know a financial
 
01:13:41.990 --> 01:13:42.000 align:start position:0%
affidavit is fairly hard to fill out if
 
01:13:44.030 --> 01:13:44.040 align:start position:0%
you don't have some support and I'm not
 
01:13:46.189 --> 01:13:46.199 align:start position:0%
sure that we have the staff that can
 
01:13:48.169 --> 01:13:48.179 align:start position:0%
really provide
 
01:13:50.390 --> 01:13:50.400 align:start position:0%
um the support that may be necessary for
 
01:13:52.729 --> 01:13:52.739 align:start position:0%
the amount of pro se people we have one
 
01:13:54.110 --> 01:13:54.120 align:start position:0%
thing that I'm shocked about and I think
 
01:13:56.149 --> 01:13:56.159 align:start position:0%
there was some we had provided some
 
01:13:58.669 --> 01:13:58.679 align:start position:0%
testimony and one of one of the
 
01:14:00.950 --> 01:14:00.960 align:start position:0%
witnesses they had been defaulted on an
 
01:14:02.330 --> 01:14:02.340 align:start position:0%
issue and they kept trying to go back
 
01:14:03.890 --> 01:14:03.900 align:start position:0%
they were so upset about it but I think
 
01:14:05.570 --> 01:14:05.580 align:start position:0%
also Pro Se people don't realize that
 
01:14:07.250 --> 01:14:07.260 align:start position:0%
it's not the doctor's office you don't
 
01:14:09.110 --> 01:14:09.120 align:start position:0%
call up and say the day before two days
 
01:14:11.330 --> 01:14:11.340 align:start position:0%
before I want to change the state or I
 
01:14:13.130 --> 01:14:13.140 align:start position:0%
don't feel well I'm not coming in I mean
 
01:14:15.590 --> 01:14:15.600 align:start position:0%
if you don't show up at court you you
 
01:14:17.750 --> 01:14:17.760 align:start position:0%
can be defaulted and if you are that
 
01:14:20.149 --> 01:14:20.159 align:start position:0%
that issue has been resolved and we do
 
01:14:21.649 --> 01:14:21.659 align:start position:0%
that to protect our courts from having
 
01:14:23.149 --> 01:14:23.159 align:start position:0%
people just come back and come back and
 
01:14:24.709 --> 01:14:24.719 align:start position:0%
come back and again that's a small thing
 
01:14:26.990 --> 01:14:27.000 align:start position:0%
but I think managing the expectation and
 
01:14:29.330 --> 01:14:29.340 align:start position:0%
the needs of our citizens that are pro
 
01:14:32.149 --> 01:14:32.159 align:start position:0%
se is important and I think that also
 
01:14:33.709 --> 01:14:33.719 align:start position:0%
protects our judges because I think
 
01:14:36.110 --> 01:14:36.120 align:start position:0%
people have testified well there's this
 
01:14:37.669 --> 01:14:37.679 align:start position:0%
law and it would have changed my child
 
01:14:39.709 --> 01:14:39.719 align:start position:0%
support or changed my parent but it's
 
01:14:41.390 --> 01:14:41.400 align:start position:0%
not for the judge to bring it forward
 
01:14:43.610 --> 01:14:43.620 align:start position:0%
and when that individual has showed me
 
01:14:45.890 --> 01:14:45.900 align:start position:0%
what they've done they've never brought
 
01:14:47.689 --> 01:14:47.699 align:start position:0%
forward there is a statute you know we
 
01:14:49.310 --> 01:14:49.320 align:start position:0%
have a statute that would have changed
 
01:14:50.390 --> 01:14:50.400 align:start position:0%
their child support or would have
 
01:14:52.310 --> 01:14:52.320 align:start position:0%
changed their maybe their parenting
 
01:14:54.649 --> 01:14:54.659 align:start position:0%
responsibilities but they didn't bring
 
01:14:57.770 --> 01:14:57.780 align:start position:0%
it forward and it you know we can't so
 
01:14:59.810 --> 01:14:59.820 align:start position:0%
we do need training the training for the
 
01:15:01.250 --> 01:15:01.260 align:start position:0%
judges it's completely but I'm going
 
01:15:03.169 --> 01:15:03.179 align:start position:0%
back to the number of pro se people we
 
01:15:05.030 --> 01:15:05.040 align:start position:0%
have how to manage their expectation
 
01:15:08.030 --> 01:15:08.040 align:start position:0%
educate them appropriately I think the
 
01:15:10.750 --> 01:15:10.760 align:start position:0%
neutral case evaluation is critical
 
01:15:14.870 --> 01:15:14.880 align:start position:0%
mediation as I understand it it's what I
 
01:15:16.310 --> 01:15:16.320 align:start position:0%
like when I'm in a case is somebody to
 
01:15:18.169 --> 01:15:18.179 align:start position:0%
tell me this is what's fair you know a
 
01:15:20.090 --> 01:15:20.100 align:start position:0%
neutral person mediation really is just
 
01:15:22.070 --> 01:15:22.080 align:start position:0%
getting people to agree the mediator
 
01:15:23.570 --> 01:15:23.580 align:start position:0%
isn't supposed to give a lot of dialogue
 
01:15:24.950 --> 01:15:24.960 align:start position:0%
on this is fair or this is what the
 
01:15:26.270 --> 01:15:26.280 align:start position:0%
court of this is you know this is how
 
01:15:27.470 --> 01:15:27.480 align:start position:0%
the case has come out they're really
 
01:15:29.209 --> 01:15:29.219 align:start position:0%
just supposed to get you to yes I mean
 
01:15:31.850 --> 01:15:31.860 align:start position:0%
again I know it's too simplified but
 
01:15:33.649 --> 01:15:33.659 align:start position:0%
that's why the neutral case evaluation
 
01:15:36.229 --> 01:15:36.239 align:start position:0%
is so good because they can actually say
 
01:15:39.050 --> 01:15:39.060 align:start position:0%
you know what this I think you know here
 
01:15:41.510 --> 01:15:41.520 align:start position:0%
uh the you're at zero and you need to
 
01:15:43.189 --> 01:15:43.199 align:start position:0%
get over here to some you know five or
 
01:15:45.950 --> 01:15:45.960 align:start position:0%
six or and and that's really some
 
01:15:48.110 --> 01:15:48.120 align:start position:0%
mediators do do that but as I understand
 
01:15:49.910 --> 01:15:49.920 align:start position:0%
it really they're supposed to get you to
 
01:15:49.920 --> 01:15:51.290 align:start position:0%
it really they're supposed to get you to
Yes

01:15:51.290 --> 01:15:51.300 align:start position:0%
Yes
 
01:15:53.870 --> 01:15:53.880 align:start position:0%
um which you know is and I'm not
 
01:15:55.430 --> 01:15:55.440 align:start position:0%
belittling that it is still very good to
 
01:15:56.750 --> 01:15:56.760 align:start position:0%
get people to yes because some people
 
01:15:59.450 --> 01:15:59.460 align:start position:0%
are reasonable and they expectations and
 
01:16:00.890 --> 01:16:00.900 align:start position:0%
that might work in a lot of cases but
 
01:16:02.870 --> 01:16:02.880 align:start position:0%
when you have somebody that really isn't
 
01:16:05.450 --> 01:16:05.460 align:start position:0%
reasonable then they're not it's not for
 
01:16:07.610 --> 01:16:07.620 align:start position:0%
the mediator to tell them you know Bob
 
01:16:09.709 --> 01:16:09.719 align:start position:0%
that's not going to go I mean that's
 
01:16:11.510 --> 01:16:11.520 align:start position:0%
what I understand anyway Pro Se people
 
01:16:13.010 --> 01:16:13.020 align:start position:0%
really concern me judges being there
 
01:16:14.390 --> 01:16:14.400 align:start position:0%
that want to and that are trained and
 
01:16:17.030 --> 01:16:17.040 align:start position:0%
pro se people having the information and
 
01:16:18.169 --> 01:16:18.179 align:start position:0%
the staff they need to give them
 
01:16:21.649 --> 01:16:21.659 align:start position:0%
information so the Staffing isn't is an
 
01:16:25.430 --> 01:16:25.440 align:start position:0%
issue and the dependence in the courts
 
01:16:30.890 --> 01:16:30.900 align:start position:0%
on uh or the prevalence of pro se
 
01:16:30.900 --> 01:16:31.689 align:start position:0%
on uh or the prevalence of pro se
um

01:16:31.689 --> 01:16:31.699 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:16:36.530 --> 01:16:36.540 align:start position:0%
individuals uh does create problems I
 
01:16:40.130 --> 01:16:40.140 align:start position:0%
know in the cases we observed in Concord
 
01:16:41.649 --> 01:16:41.659 align:start position:0%
last week
 
01:16:45.290 --> 01:16:45.300 align:start position:0%
there was an attorney only I think in
 
01:16:48.470 --> 01:16:48.480 align:start position:0%
one in one case
 
01:16:51.410 --> 01:16:51.420 align:start position:0%
um and and that was all
 
01:16:51.420 --> 01:16:52.570 align:start position:0%
um and and that was all
um

01:16:52.570 --> 01:16:52.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:16:58.430 --> 01:16:58.440 align:start position:0%
I also was surprised to learn that there
 
01:17:02.930 --> 01:17:02.940 align:start position:0%
are about a dozen different forms
 
01:17:06.530 --> 01:17:06.540 align:start position:0%
um having to do with divorce
 
01:17:09.290 --> 01:17:09.300 align:start position:0%
legal separation petitions with minor
 
01:17:09.300 --> 01:17:11.090 align:start position:0%
legal separation petitions with minor
children

01:17:11.090 --> 01:17:11.100 align:start position:0%
children
 
01:17:12.770 --> 01:17:12.780 align:start position:0%
um parenting
 
01:17:12.780 --> 01:17:14.810 align:start position:0%
um parenting
and

01:17:14.810 --> 01:17:14.820 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:17:14.820 --> 01:17:15.890 align:start position:0%
and
um

01:17:15.890 --> 01:17:15.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:17:18.530 --> 01:17:18.540 align:start position:0%
they're complicated
 
01:17:18.540 --> 01:17:20.450 align:start position:0%
they're complicated
and

01:17:20.450 --> 01:17:20.460 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:17:23.570 --> 01:17:23.580 align:start position:0%
it is my understanding that at least
 
01:17:26.630 --> 01:17:26.640 align:start position:0%
some of those forms come from
 
01:17:29.450 --> 01:17:29.460 align:start position:0%
legislative action is that correct
 
01:17:31.010 --> 01:17:31.020 align:start position:0%
representative wall
 
01:17:33.950 --> 01:17:33.960 align:start position:0%
uh I don't believe so I believe it's the
 
01:17:36.229 --> 01:17:36.239 align:start position:0%
courts that
 
01:17:39.310 --> 01:17:39.320 align:start position:0%
make those ones I I don't recall ever
 
01:17:41.209 --> 01:17:41.219 align:start position:0%
oops I'm sorry
 
01:17:44.030 --> 01:17:44.040 align:start position:0%
yeah I don't recall ever voting on a
 
01:17:47.570 --> 01:17:47.580 align:start position:0%
ever having a bill of a forum coming in
 
01:17:51.050 --> 01:17:51.060 align:start position:0%
before okay so not the child's not any
 
01:17:54.709 --> 01:17:54.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:01.970 --> 01:18:01.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:05.990 --> 01:18:06.000 align:start position:0%
um yeah well I know I know we did form
 
01:18:08.810 --> 01:18:08.820 align:start position:0%
formulas but as far as the form was left
 
01:18:12.010 --> 01:18:12.020 align:start position:0%
okay so it would be the form of the UN
 
01:18:14.689 --> 01:18:14.699 align:start position:0%
underlying principles right that then
 
01:18:17.390 --> 01:18:17.400 align:start position:0%
are applied by the court right
 
01:18:19.490 --> 01:18:19.500 align:start position:0%
um uh
 
01:18:22.310 --> 01:18:22.320 align:start position:0%
excuse me
 
01:18:24.229 --> 01:18:24.239 align:start position:0%
yeah that's
 
01:18:26.990 --> 01:18:27.000 align:start position:0%
that's what I'm I'm curious about that
 
01:18:28.850 --> 01:18:28.860 align:start position:0%
in fact that you know
 
01:18:33.110 --> 01:18:33.120 align:start position:0%
how much of those forms are based on any
 
01:18:36.709 --> 01:18:36.719 align:start position:0%
rsas and I'm not embarrassed to say I
 
01:18:39.470 --> 01:18:39.480 align:start position:0%
don't know I mean because
 
01:18:41.750 --> 01:18:41.760 align:start position:0%
we all know just a tiny bit of all this
 
01:18:43.910 --> 01:18:43.920 align:start position:0%
it's so complicated
 
01:18:46.610 --> 01:18:46.620 align:start position:0%
um I did hear a comment from one of the
 
01:18:48.169 --> 01:18:48.179 align:start position:0%
clerks that I thought was quite
 
01:18:51.770 --> 01:18:51.780 align:start position:0%
interesting having to do with
 
01:18:54.970 --> 01:18:54.980 align:start position:0%
um the financial forms
 
01:18:59.149 --> 01:18:59.159 align:start position:0%
and the comment was that the forms all
 
01:19:02.510 --> 01:19:02.520 align:start position:0%
had to do with income
 
01:19:07.490 --> 01:19:07.500 align:start position:0%
money coming in from whatever source
 
01:19:11.990 --> 01:19:12.000 align:start position:0%
but none of the forms addressed the
 
01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:14.330 align:start position:0%
but none of the forms addressed the
costs

01:19:14.330 --> 01:19:14.340 align:start position:0%
costs
 
01:19:18.470 --> 01:19:18.480 align:start position:0%
um particular to that family of raising
 
01:19:21.950 --> 01:19:21.960 align:start position:0%
a child whether there are specific costs
 
01:19:24.410 --> 01:19:24.420 align:start position:0%
that aren't covered by health insurance
 
01:19:28.490 --> 01:19:28.500 align:start position:0%
for example or whether the child is you
 
01:19:32.770 --> 01:19:32.780 align:start position:0%
know going to be an Olympic skier and
 
01:19:38.030 --> 01:19:38.040 align:start position:0%
whatever but are those costs in some
 
01:19:38.040 --> 01:19:39.189 align:start position:0%
whatever but are those costs in some
ways

01:19:39.189 --> 01:19:39.199 align:start position:0%
ways
 
01:19:45.890 --> 01:19:45.900 align:start position:0%
born more by one party or another based
 
01:19:45.900 --> 01:19:48.430 align:start position:0%
born more by one party or another based
on

01:19:48.430 --> 01:19:48.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:51.290 --> 01:19:51.300 align:start position:0%
when the child is with
 
01:19:54.350 --> 01:19:54.360 align:start position:0%
that party and
 
01:19:54.360 --> 01:19:56.930 align:start position:0%
that party and
that

01:19:56.930 --> 01:19:56.940 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:19:59.930 --> 01:19:59.940 align:start position:0%
occurred to me that it it that might be
 
01:20:02.510 --> 01:20:02.520 align:start position:0%
a legitimate question
 
01:20:02.520 --> 01:20:04.430 align:start position:0%
a legitimate question
um

01:20:04.430 --> 01:20:04.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:08.270 --> 01:20:08.280 align:start position:0%
and that's why I want to know whether
 
01:20:11.209 --> 01:20:11.219 align:start position:0%
what role the legislature
 
01:20:11.219 --> 01:20:13.130 align:start position:0%
what role the legislature
plays

01:20:13.130 --> 01:20:13.140 align:start position:0%
plays
 
01:20:15.470 --> 01:20:15.480 align:start position:0%
um in that and I'm sure people who are
 
01:20:17.209 --> 01:20:17.219 align:start position:0%
more knowledgeable than I am would know
 
01:20:20.030 --> 01:20:20.040 align:start position:0%
the answer to that
 
01:20:21.950 --> 01:20:21.960 align:start position:0%
so I just want to respond that the
 
01:20:23.390 --> 01:20:23.400 align:start position:0%
financial affidavit in the Family Court
 
01:20:27.110 --> 01:20:27.120 align:start position:0%
the third page is all what that fan that
 
01:20:29.390 --> 01:20:29.400 align:start position:0%
parent and that household's costs are
 
01:20:31.910 --> 01:20:31.920 align:start position:0%
and that is why I have asked for it from
 
01:20:33.530 --> 01:20:33.540 align:start position:0%
some of the people that have asked for
 
01:20:35.390 --> 01:20:35.400 align:start position:0%
the child support guidelines to be
 
01:20:36.669 --> 01:20:36.679 align:start position:0%
changed for different reasons because
 
01:20:40.130 --> 01:20:40.140 align:start position:0%
judges look at that and they they do
 
01:20:41.270 --> 01:20:41.280 align:start position:0%
determine whether they're going to
 
01:20:42.890 --> 01:20:42.900 align:start position:0%
deviate if you've asked for a deviation
 
01:20:45.770 --> 01:20:45.780 align:start position:0%
based on the maybe extraordinary housing
 
01:20:48.169 --> 01:20:48.179 align:start position:0%
costs some parent has or uninsured
 
01:20:51.290 --> 01:20:51.300 align:start position:0%
Health that type of thing so I don't I
 
01:20:53.450 --> 01:20:53.460 align:start position:0%
just want to say I do think the judicial
 
01:20:54.709 --> 01:20:54.719 align:start position:0%
brand you're not saying they don't but
 
01:20:56.870 --> 01:20:56.880 align:start position:0%
that that form is that's definitely
 
01:20:58.610 --> 01:20:58.620 align:start position:0%
there and it's definitely why I've asked
 
01:21:00.830 --> 01:21:00.840 align:start position:0%
for it from folks and as of yet I
 
01:21:02.390 --> 01:21:02.400 align:start position:0%
haven't gotten it from that gentleman
 
01:21:02.400 --> 01:21:03.290 align:start position:0%
haven't gotten it from that gentleman
but

01:21:03.290 --> 01:21:03.300 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:21:05.990 --> 01:21:06.000 align:start position:0%
um that is what judges do look at and
 
01:21:07.490 --> 01:21:07.500 align:start position:0%
one reason why I think our guidelines
 
01:21:09.410 --> 01:21:09.420 align:start position:0%
are good I don't I'm not sure
 
01:21:11.090 --> 01:21:11.100 align:start position:0%
specifically what the guidelines want to
 
01:21:14.090 --> 01:21:14.100 align:start position:0%
change but we do give judges the
 
01:21:14.100 --> 01:21:15.290 align:start position:0%
change but we do give judges the
um

01:21:15.290 --> 01:21:15.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:21:16.910 --> 01:21:16.920 align:start position:0%
the discretion to look at that and also
 
01:21:18.470 --> 01:21:18.480 align:start position:0%
to look at is somebody voluntarily
 
01:21:20.630 --> 01:21:20.640 align:start position:0%
putting one-third of their income into
 
01:21:22.850 --> 01:21:22.860 align:start position:0%
retirement or some type
 
01:21:25.790 --> 01:21:25.800 align:start position:0%
you know so we can double check but I I
 
01:21:28.430 --> 01:21:28.440 align:start position:0%
that is there and one of the things that
 
01:21:30.229 --> 01:21:30.239 align:start position:0%
happens with Pro Se I mean that form is
 
01:21:31.970 --> 01:21:31.980 align:start position:0%
supposed to be submitted at every family
 
01:21:33.530 --> 01:21:33.540 align:start position:0%
hearing it's supposed to be updated and
 
01:21:35.270 --> 01:21:35.280 align:start position:0%
submitted at every family hearing and
 
01:21:36.709 --> 01:21:36.719 align:start position:0%
that's another thing about expectations
 
01:21:38.750 --> 01:21:38.760 align:start position:0%
I think if you're Pro Se I mean the
 
01:21:40.189 --> 01:21:40.199 align:start position:0%
rules are difficult for me and I haven't
 
01:21:41.330 --> 01:21:41.340 align:start position:0%
gone to a hearing that I haven't
 
01:21:44.390 --> 01:21:44.400 align:start position:0%
accidentally missed something but when
 
01:21:47.209 --> 01:21:47.219 align:start position:0%
that isn't provided every time then we
 
01:21:51.649 --> 01:21:51.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:51.659 --> 01:21:52.790 align:start position:0%
 
but

01:21:52.790 --> 01:21:52.800 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:21:54.770 --> 01:21:54.780 align:start position:0%
representative McMahon I don't want to
 
01:22:00.410 --> 01:22:00.420 align:start position:0%
put you on the spot but I wonder if you
 
01:22:04.130 --> 01:22:04.140 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:06.050 --> 01:22:06.060 align:start position:0%
what your thinking is if you have
 
01:22:07.610 --> 01:22:07.620 align:start position:0%
anything that you want to share now you
 
01:22:08.510 --> 01:22:08.520 align:start position:0%
might not
 
01:22:11.030 --> 01:22:11.040 align:start position:0%
um about where you would like to see us
 
01:22:14.270 --> 01:22:14.280 align:start position:0%
go I just value your opinion do you want
 
01:22:17.570 --> 01:22:17.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:21.470 --> 01:22:21.480 align:start position:0%
um I am I hope I'm honorable but I don't
 
01:22:24.470 --> 01:22:24.480 align:start position:0%
deserve the title your honor
 
01:22:24.480 --> 01:22:32.689 align:start position:0%
deserve the title your honor
here

01:22:32.689 --> 01:22:32.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:34.910 --> 01:22:34.920 align:start position:0%
um and listening to my colleagues and
 
01:22:36.649 --> 01:22:36.659 align:start position:0%
also uh what's going through the
 
01:22:39.649 --> 01:22:39.659 align:start position:0%
database that I have myself
 
01:22:42.110 --> 01:22:42.120 align:start position:0%
um on the meetings that we've taken
 
01:22:45.169 --> 01:22:45.179 align:start position:0%
um one issue and hearing today there's a
 
01:22:47.870 --> 01:22:47.880 align:start position:0%
a process that we've learned here again
 
01:22:49.790 --> 01:22:49.800 align:start position:0%
specific to Family Court
 
01:22:52.490 --> 01:22:52.500 align:start position:0%
and is where have violations of the
 
01:22:54.290 --> 01:22:54.300 align:start position:0%
quote process or the interpretation of
 
01:22:57.229 --> 01:22:57.239 align:start position:0%
process uh taking place and then need
 
01:22:58.970 --> 01:22:58.980 align:start position:0%
the dressing and one of them was Rules
 
01:23:03.950 --> 01:23:03.960 align:start position:0%
of Evidence and what has come in my view
 
01:23:05.630 --> 01:23:05.640 align:start position:0%
of this is something for us to consider
 
01:23:06.890 --> 01:23:06.900 align:start position:0%
and work on
 
01:23:09.770 --> 01:23:09.780 align:start position:0%
was uh when when a court case comes
 
01:23:12.169 --> 01:23:12.179 align:start position:0%
before the
 
01:23:16.070 --> 01:23:16.080 align:start position:0%
the Battleground if you will uh then
 
01:23:19.030 --> 01:23:19.040 align:start position:0%
it's uh are each uh
 
01:23:22.250 --> 01:23:22.260 align:start position:0%
defendant and uh petitioner
 
01:23:24.649 --> 01:23:24.659 align:start position:0%
are they fully loaded with with evidence
 
01:23:26.689 --> 01:23:26.699 align:start position:0%
and when the job when I've seen and
 
01:23:29.209 --> 01:23:29.219 align:start position:0%
tested seen read and heard in testimony
 
01:23:33.410 --> 01:23:33.420 align:start position:0%
is that uh judges have a specific
 
01:23:33.420 --> 01:23:35.450 align:start position:0%
is that uh judges have a specific
interpretive

01:23:35.450 --> 01:23:35.460 align:start position:0%
interpretive
 
01:23:38.149 --> 01:23:38.159 align:start position:0%
uh intent of what they consider
 
01:23:41.090 --> 01:23:41.100 align:start position:0%
legitimate or not which is an opinion
 
01:23:43.610 --> 01:23:43.620 align:start position:0%
and not based on law but whether they
 
01:23:46.430 --> 01:23:46.440 align:start position:0%
what they consider as as evidence or
 
01:23:48.110 --> 01:23:48.120 align:start position:0%
something that is pertinent to the
 
01:23:50.750 --> 01:23:50.760 align:start position:0%
adjudication of the of the action in
 
01:23:54.590 --> 01:23:54.600 align:start position:0%
place and so and so what I saw here in
 
01:23:57.169 --> 01:23:57.179 align:start position:0%
this was that the a rules rules of
 
01:23:57.179 --> 01:23:58.370 align:start position:0%
this was that the a rules rules of
evidence

01:23:58.370 --> 01:23:58.380 align:start position:0%
evidence
 
01:24:00.830 --> 01:24:00.840 align:start position:0%
need to be need to be addressed as part
 
01:24:03.910 --> 01:24:03.920 align:start position:0%
of enhancing the family court experience
 
01:24:06.590 --> 01:24:06.600 align:start position:0%
based on what has been discussed here is
 
01:24:09.709 --> 01:24:09.719 align:start position:0%
that it's um not uh followed and it's
 
01:24:11.390 --> 01:24:11.400 align:start position:0%
interesting we just had something else
 
01:24:14.209 --> 01:24:14.219 align:start position:0%
passed to us right now and it's and it
 
01:24:16.729 --> 01:24:16.739 align:start position:0%
says right in here it says uh
 
01:24:19.430 --> 01:24:19.440 align:start position:0%
um you'll see it on page four of nine
 
01:24:22.430 --> 01:24:22.440 align:start position:0%
it happened January of 2023 and this
 
01:24:25.430 --> 01:24:25.440 align:start position:0%
fourth proceeding where it says the
 
01:24:27.590 --> 01:24:27.600 align:start position:0%
court does when I say the court I don't
 
01:24:29.209 --> 01:24:29.219 align:start position:0%
know who wrote this whether it's a clerk
 
01:24:32.330 --> 01:24:32.340 align:start position:0%
or the judge him or herself but it says
 
01:24:33.950 --> 01:24:33.960 align:start position:0%
Rules of Evidence are not technically or
 
01:24:35.750 --> 01:24:35.760 align:start position:0%
strictly applicable
 
01:24:38.390 --> 01:24:38.400 align:start position:0%
and the court const when they're cooked
 
01:24:40.370 --> 01:24:40.380 align:start position:0%
in schools a motion for reconsideration
 
01:24:41.870 --> 01:24:41.880 align:start position:0%
that's what's Happening Here
 
01:24:44.930 --> 01:24:44.940 align:start position:0%
that's when I have learned uh in my
 
01:24:46.189 --> 01:24:46.199 align:start position:0%
perception and curious what other
 
01:24:50.870 --> 01:24:50.880 align:start position:0%
members feel is when the petitioners
 
01:24:52.790 --> 01:24:52.800 align:start position:0%
do not feel they're being heard is
 
01:24:55.910 --> 01:24:55.920 align:start position:0%
because evidence is not being not
 
01:24:58.189 --> 01:24:58.199 align:start position:0%
allowed to be presented or if it is
 
01:25:00.530 --> 01:25:00.540 align:start position:0%
allowed it can be just discounted based
 
01:25:02.570 --> 01:25:02.580 align:start position:0%
on the opinion of of the Court the court
 
01:25:03.950 --> 01:25:03.960 align:start position:0%
meaning the judge
 
01:25:06.830 --> 01:25:06.840 align:start position:0%
uh in the in the promulgation of the of
 
01:25:08.750 --> 01:25:08.760 align:start position:0%
the court case itself
 
01:25:11.090 --> 01:25:11.100 align:start position:0%
so that's that's what I
 
01:25:12.470 --> 01:25:12.480 align:start position:0%
that's what I've learned on all this and
 
01:25:14.330 --> 01:25:14.340 align:start position:0%
then what happens when there's the when
 
01:25:17.270 --> 01:25:17.280 align:start position:0%
you want to the playing field that your
 
01:25:19.250 --> 01:25:19.260 align:start position:0%
your evidence will be heard
 
01:25:21.410 --> 01:25:21.420 align:start position:0%
then we go in go into then what takes
 
01:25:23.689 --> 01:25:23.699 align:start position:0%
place on action uh like oatmeal
 
01:25:25.669 --> 01:25:25.679 align:start position:0%
co-parenting and so on based on what's
 
01:25:27.910 --> 01:25:27.920 align:start position:0%
the evidence before I decide on
 
01:25:30.709 --> 01:25:30.719 align:start position:0%
co-parenting not that there's a de facto
 
01:25:34.189 --> 01:25:34.199 align:start position:0%
uh predetermined result it's what's the
 
01:25:36.590 --> 01:25:36.600 align:start position:0%
evidence that then says okay to 50 50.
 
01:25:39.169 --> 01:25:39.179 align:start position:0%
to me that makes intrinsic sense but but
 
01:25:41.030 --> 01:25:41.040 align:start position:0%
it's based on what
 
01:25:43.850 --> 01:25:43.860 align:start position:0%
and uh when what's just interesting when
 
01:25:46.729 --> 01:25:46.739 align:start position:0%
I see evidence is not does not play a
 
01:25:46.739 --> 01:25:47.570 align:start position:0%
I see evidence is not does not play a
role

01:25:47.570 --> 01:25:47.580 align:start position:0%
role
 
01:25:50.510 --> 01:25:50.520 align:start position:0%
but then and then when uh compounded by
 
01:25:52.790 --> 01:25:52.800 align:start position:0%
professional attorneys also can afford
 
01:25:55.430 --> 01:25:55.440 align:start position:0%
them versus Pro Se and that's uh I went
 
01:25:57.890 --> 01:25:57.900 align:start position:0%
to the the team of us went to the
 
01:26:00.050 --> 01:26:00.060 align:start position:0%
National court system and out of the
 
01:26:02.990 --> 01:26:03.000 align:start position:0%
five has either five cases on a five out
 
01:26:06.290 --> 01:26:06.300 align:start position:0%
of six one didn't show up but five
 
01:26:08.870 --> 01:26:08.880 align:start position:0%
um four were per se and one had an
 
01:26:10.790 --> 01:26:10.800 align:start position:0%
attorney and and the only attorney was
 
01:26:13.490 --> 01:26:13.500 align:start position:0%
doing was observing uh what I saw it was
 
01:26:15.530 --> 01:26:15.540 align:start position:0%
sitting at the table but it was a judge
 
01:26:18.410 --> 01:26:18.420 align:start position:0%
asking you know directly the but the um
 
01:26:20.450 --> 01:26:20.460 align:start position:0%
the individual
 
01:26:22.910 --> 01:26:22.920 align:start position:0%
but but anyway my point The Madam chair
 
01:26:25.790 --> 01:26:25.800 align:start position:0%
was uh Rules of Evidence playing a role
 
01:26:28.370 --> 01:26:28.380 align:start position:0%
in what I um and as representative
 
01:26:28.380 --> 01:26:29.810 align:start position:0%
in what I um and as representative
uh

01:26:29.810 --> 01:26:29.820 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:26:31.850 --> 01:26:31.860 align:start position:0%
is obviously representative stated was
 
01:26:36.050 --> 01:26:36.060 align:start position:0%
that what we recommend as uh laws to be
 
01:26:36.060 --> 01:26:37.370 align:start position:0%
that what we recommend as uh laws to be
passed

01:26:37.370 --> 01:26:37.380 align:start position:0%
passed
 
01:26:39.830 --> 01:26:39.840 align:start position:0%
as to consider for you know for the
 
01:26:40.970 --> 01:26:40.980 align:start position:0%
court system
 
01:26:42.950 --> 01:26:42.960 align:start position:0%
not not saying what the rules are but
 
01:26:46.490 --> 01:26:46.500 align:start position:0%
what's the law to to for the for us as
 
01:26:48.890 --> 01:26:48.900 align:start position:0%
representatives to recommend for Passage
 
01:26:50.510 --> 01:26:50.520 align:start position:0%
through the I would imagine the
 
01:26:54.590 --> 01:26:54.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:54.600 --> 01:26:56.689 align:start position:0%
 
well

01:26:56.689 --> 01:26:56.699 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:26:58.910 --> 01:26:58.920 align:start position:0%
for that comment so the issue of Rules
 
01:27:01.790 --> 01:27:01.800 align:start position:0%
of Evidence we did hear a lot about
 
01:27:06.770 --> 01:27:06.780 align:start position:0%
um uh from people who have testified and
 
01:27:11.629 --> 01:27:11.639 align:start position:0%
what to me came was most clear and and
 
01:27:14.149 --> 01:27:14.159 align:start position:0%
in a way I think you know you supported
 
01:27:16.970 --> 01:27:16.980 align:start position:0%
that is that
 
01:27:20.330 --> 01:27:20.340 align:start position:0%
um pro se litigants
 
01:27:22.390 --> 01:27:22.400 align:start position:0%
don't understand
 
01:27:28.910 --> 01:27:28.920 align:start position:0%
the role that Rules of Evidence could or
 
01:27:28.920 --> 01:27:29.870 align:start position:0%
the role that Rules of Evidence could or
should

01:27:29.870 --> 01:27:29.880 align:start position:0%
should
 
01:27:35.870 --> 01:27:35.880 align:start position:0%
play in in court procedures and what are
 
01:27:38.629 --> 01:27:38.639 align:start position:0%
the rules of evidence I mean it's not as
 
01:27:41.149 --> 01:27:41.159 align:start position:0%
if it's the Ten Commandments and even
 
01:27:43.669 --> 01:27:43.679 align:start position:0%
then we have differences of opinion we
 
01:27:45.410 --> 01:27:45.420 align:start position:0%
certainly have differences of opinion on
 
01:27:48.350 --> 01:27:48.360 align:start position:0%
what Rules of Evidence are and so the
 
01:27:50.510 --> 01:27:50.520 align:start position:0%
question that that you raise I think is
 
01:27:53.330 --> 01:27:53.340 align:start position:0%
a legitimate question and the answer
 
01:27:57.110 --> 01:27:57.120 align:start position:0%
might be very complicated or it might be
 
01:28:02.530 --> 01:28:02.540 align:start position:0%
as simple as finding a way to have a
 
01:28:07.729 --> 01:28:07.739 align:start position:0%
uh Pro Se uh litigants understand the
 
01:28:10.910 --> 01:28:10.920 align:start position:0%
roles of Rules of Evidence or it might
 
01:28:12.770 --> 01:28:12.780 align:start position:0%
be something much more specific than
 
01:28:14.570 --> 01:28:14.580 align:start position:0%
that so I think that certainly is a
 
01:28:16.310 --> 01:28:16.320 align:start position:0%
legitimate issue
 
01:28:18.850 --> 01:28:18.860 align:start position:0%
having been raised a lot
 
01:28:21.830 --> 01:28:21.840 align:start position:0%
in our hearings to go on our list of
 
01:28:25.129 --> 01:28:25.139 align:start position:0%
things we might want to look into yes I
 
01:28:27.110 --> 01:28:27.120 align:start position:0%
mean thank you for adding that well
 
01:28:29.390 --> 01:28:29.400 align:start position:0%
Madam chair that's your guidance on on
 
01:28:33.229 --> 01:28:33.239 align:start position:0%
this one on and and any other uh esteem
 
01:28:37.669 --> 01:28:37.679 align:start position:0%
members is uh and that's I want to make
 
01:28:39.470 --> 01:28:39.480 align:start position:0%
sure I say it in my context
 
01:28:42.050 --> 01:28:42.060 align:start position:0%
there's been there has been comments of
 
01:28:44.149 --> 01:28:44.159 align:start position:0%
implication that the the judges
 
01:28:44.159 --> 01:28:45.410 align:start position:0%
implication that the the judges
themselves

01:28:45.410 --> 01:28:45.420 align:start position:0%
themselves
 
01:28:47.149 --> 01:28:47.159 align:start position:0%
aren't competent
 
01:28:50.570 --> 01:28:50.580 align:start position:0%
and and making their decisions and this
 
01:28:52.490 --> 01:28:52.500 align:start position:0%
is where you get to the training not and
 
01:28:54.470 --> 01:28:54.480 align:start position:0%
confident in terms of dealing in the
 
01:28:57.290 --> 01:28:57.300 align:start position:0%
uniqueness of in the Family Court uh as
 
01:28:58.729 --> 01:28:58.739 align:start position:0%
opposed to a criminal case we haven't
 
01:29:01.430 --> 01:29:01.440 align:start position:0%
dealing with family issues and and you
 
01:29:03.709 --> 01:29:03.719 align:start position:0%
know it will stipulate what what we've
 
01:29:05.629 --> 01:29:05.639 align:start position:0%
heard already
 
01:29:08.030 --> 01:29:08.040 align:start position:0%
um is there uh
 
01:29:10.669 --> 01:29:10.679 align:start position:0%
from a training standpoint
 
01:29:12.830 --> 01:29:12.840 align:start position:0%
is that is that something no that's
 
01:29:13.910 --> 01:29:13.920 align:start position:0%
something that's come up here that we
 
01:29:16.070 --> 01:29:16.080 align:start position:0%
should make also part of law that has
 
01:29:19.310 --> 01:29:19.320 align:start position:0%
been suggested here for those uh and
 
01:29:23.450 --> 01:29:23.460 align:start position:0%
then the enhanced uh how they're paid as
 
01:29:25.550 --> 01:29:25.560 align:start position:0%
well for folks to take on these cases
 
01:29:26.930 --> 01:29:26.940 align:start position:0%
which uh
 
01:29:28.970 --> 01:29:28.980 align:start position:0%
there's as we said there's hundreds
 
01:29:30.470 --> 01:29:30.480 align:start position:0%
thousands of them
 
01:29:32.689 --> 01:29:32.699 align:start position:0%
but who's willing to take on to who's
 
01:29:34.669 --> 01:29:34.679 align:start position:0%
like a judge in the system and the staff
 
01:29:36.350 --> 01:29:36.360 align:start position:0%
by the way you have the staff there that
 
01:29:38.030 --> 01:29:38.040 align:start position:0%
really does a heck of a job
 
01:29:40.970 --> 01:29:40.980 align:start position:0%
uh along with the judge's work on
 
01:29:43.430 --> 01:29:43.440 align:start position:0%
meeting these these uh these Court
 
01:29:45.470 --> 01:29:45.480 align:start position:0%
challenges and if we don't have the
 
01:29:45.480 --> 01:29:46.610 align:start position:0%
challenges and if we don't have the
resources

01:29:46.610 --> 01:29:46.620 align:start position:0%
resources
 
01:29:49.189 --> 01:29:49.199 align:start position:0%
then that what I've been reading when
 
01:29:51.050 --> 01:29:51.060 align:start position:0%
I've been reading what we've been
 
01:29:54.050 --> 01:29:54.060 align:start position:0%
provided is that there appears to be a
 
01:29:55.910 --> 01:29:55.920 align:start position:0%
facilitation to move things faster
 
01:29:55.920 --> 01:29:57.110 align:start position:0%
facilitation to move things faster
through

01:29:57.110 --> 01:29:57.120 align:start position:0%
through
 
01:29:59.149 --> 01:29:59.159 align:start position:0%
so that the cases are handled quicker
 
01:30:00.830 --> 01:30:00.840 align:start position:0%
and not necessarily to the best interest
 
01:30:03.770 --> 01:30:03.780 align:start position:0%
of either party
 
01:30:06.470 --> 01:30:06.480 align:start position:0%
uh um I hear what you're saying and I'm
 
01:30:09.169 --> 01:30:09.179 align:start position:0%
sure there are people who who believe
 
01:30:11.570 --> 01:30:11.580 align:start position:0%
that just as I'm sure they're people who
 
01:30:11.580 --> 01:30:13.189 align:start position:0%
that just as I'm sure they're people who
believe

01:30:13.189 --> 01:30:13.199 align:start position:0%
believe
 
01:30:16.250 --> 01:30:16.260 align:start position:0%
um contrary to that
 
01:30:19.149 --> 01:30:19.159 align:start position:0%
um you know this
 
01:30:24.010 --> 01:30:24.020 align:start position:0%
it isn't we're a litigious country and
 
01:30:27.890 --> 01:30:27.900 align:start position:0%
these systems are adversarial we would
 
01:30:30.050 --> 01:30:30.060 align:start position:0%
like not to see them adversarial when
 
01:30:32.030 --> 01:30:32.040 align:start position:0%
they involve children in the well-being
 
01:30:35.030 --> 01:30:35.040 align:start position:0%
of families but
 
01:30:37.910 --> 01:30:37.920 align:start position:0%
um we tend to set things up with winners
 
01:30:40.930 --> 01:30:40.940 align:start position:0%
and losers and and all those things that
 
01:30:43.310 --> 01:30:43.320 align:start position:0%
make it hard to just be nice to
 
01:30:43.320 --> 01:30:44.530 align:start position:0%
make it hard to just be nice to
everybody

01:30:44.530 --> 01:30:44.540 align:start position:0%
everybody
 
01:30:47.689 --> 01:30:47.699 align:start position:0%
but we also have to I think remember
 
01:30:50.470 --> 01:30:50.480 align:start position:0%
that the people who have been diligent
 
01:30:54.229 --> 01:30:54.239 align:start position:0%
in coming to speak before us
 
01:30:54.239 --> 01:30:54.830 align:start position:0%
in coming to speak before us
um

01:30:54.830 --> 01:30:54.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:30:57.910 --> 01:30:57.920 align:start position:0%
are uh are
 
01:31:01.189 --> 01:31:01.199 align:start position:0%
very distressed very very distressed
 
01:31:04.370 --> 01:31:04.380 align:start position:0%
about what their experiences have been
 
01:31:07.850 --> 01:31:07.860 align:start position:0%
and we also have to remember that as
 
01:31:10.189 --> 01:31:10.199 align:start position:0%
important as their experiences are and
 
01:31:13.910 --> 01:31:13.920 align:start position:0%
we don't want to minimize that they also
 
01:31:17.030 --> 01:31:17.040 align:start position:0%
um are a very small minority
 
01:31:22.010 --> 01:31:22.020 align:start position:0%
of all of the cases that are heard and
 
01:31:22.020 --> 01:31:23.390 align:start position:0%
of all of the cases that are heard and
um

01:31:23.390 --> 01:31:23.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:31:26.770 --> 01:31:26.780 align:start position:0%
that go through and people are
 
01:31:29.689 --> 01:31:29.699 align:start position:0%
reasonably satisfied understanding that
 
01:31:32.689 --> 01:31:32.699 align:start position:0%
the world isn't perfect so we also have
 
01:31:37.070 --> 01:31:37.080 align:start position:0%
to be careful not to be swayed by
 
01:31:37.080 --> 01:31:37.970 align:start position:0%
to be careful not to be swayed by
um

01:31:37.970 --> 01:31:37.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:31:40.729 --> 01:31:40.739 align:start position:0%
information that might be taken out of
 
01:31:44.390 --> 01:31:44.400 align:start position:0%
context but I go back again to the one
 
01:31:47.290 --> 01:31:47.300 align:start position:0%
of my major concerns and that is
 
01:31:51.950 --> 01:31:51.960 align:start position:0%
recruitment training supervision and
 
01:31:54.890 --> 01:31:54.900 align:start position:0%
accountability and some of that is the
 
01:31:56.689 --> 01:31:56.699 align:start position:0%
responsibility of the executive branch
 
01:31:58.970 --> 01:31:58.980 align:start position:0%
so if it's the responsibility of the
 
01:32:00.649 --> 01:32:00.659 align:start position:0%
legislative and some of it's the
 
01:32:02.629 --> 01:32:02.639 align:start position:0%
responsibility of the judicial branch
 
01:32:06.050 --> 01:32:06.060 align:start position:0%
and how this committee handles that I
 
01:32:07.970 --> 01:32:07.980 align:start position:0%
don't know but
 
01:32:07.980 --> 01:32:08.990 align:start position:0%
don't know but
um

01:32:08.990 --> 01:32:09.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:32:13.550 --> 01:32:13.560 align:start position:0%
that's why I'm so pleased that chairman
 
01:32:15.350 --> 01:32:15.360 align:start position:0%
Pearson who was very sorry that he
 
01:32:17.510 --> 01:32:17.520 align:start position:0%
couldn't be here today but is involved
 
01:32:18.410 --> 01:32:18.420 align:start position:0%
in other
 
01:32:21.250 --> 01:32:21.260 align:start position:0%
important business out of state
 
01:32:24.110 --> 01:32:24.120 align:start position:0%
agreed that this session would be a work
 
01:32:27.229 --> 01:32:27.239 align:start position:0%
session so that before we go into the
 
01:32:30.290 --> 01:32:30.300 align:start position:0%
summer recess we could begin to identify
 
01:32:33.890 --> 01:32:33.900 align:start position:0%
Myriad issues that we'd like to look at
 
01:32:36.910 --> 01:32:36.920 align:start position:0%
more deeply and
 
01:32:39.649 --> 01:32:39.659 align:start position:0%
and I think you raised some some
 
01:32:43.790 --> 01:32:43.800 align:start position:0%
important some important issues and uh
 
01:32:45.709 --> 01:32:45.719 align:start position:0%
how we
 
01:32:49.189 --> 01:32:49.199 align:start position:0%
determine what is in fact the
 
01:32:51.410 --> 01:32:51.420 align:start position:0%
legislative responsibility or the
 
01:32:52.669 --> 01:32:52.679 align:start position:0%
responsibility of one of the other
 
01:32:55.149 --> 01:32:55.159 align:start position:0%
branches is going to be Central to this
 
01:32:57.770 --> 01:32:57.780 align:start position:0%
representative bull
 
01:32:59.810 --> 01:32:59.820 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chairman
 
01:33:01.610 --> 01:33:01.620 align:start position:0%
um the one thing and I do agree with
 
01:33:03.410 --> 01:33:03.420 align:start position:0%
everything that you're saying
 
01:33:05.930 --> 01:33:05.940 align:start position:0%
um the one observation a couple actually
 
01:33:08.689 --> 01:33:08.699 align:start position:0%
a couple of observation we had some very
 
01:33:10.790 --> 01:33:10.800 align:start position:0%
brave people come to testify before us
 
01:33:12.709 --> 01:33:12.719 align:start position:0%
but I do believe there are a lot of
 
01:33:15.410 --> 01:33:15.420 align:start position:0%
other families out there that are
 
01:33:17.570 --> 01:33:17.580 align:start position:0%
struggling but they do not want to bring
 
01:33:19.129 --> 01:33:19.139 align:start position:0%
their case forwards because they're
 
01:33:21.290 --> 01:33:21.300 align:start position:0%
afraid there could be a retaliation or
 
01:33:23.689 --> 01:33:23.699 align:start position:0%
it be used against them if they have to
 
01:33:25.490 --> 01:33:25.500 align:start position:0%
go back to court so they're trying to
 
01:33:27.950 --> 01:33:27.960 align:start position:0%
keep it a private matter that would be
 
01:33:30.169 --> 01:33:30.179 align:start position:0%
one the other is when we talk about
 
01:33:32.270 --> 01:33:32.280 align:start position:0%
domestic violence I think that we need
 
01:33:35.330 --> 01:33:35.340 align:start position:0%
to be sure that we're separating how
 
01:33:39.229 --> 01:33:39.239 align:start position:0%
many cases were actually dropped and how
 
01:33:41.689 --> 01:33:41.699 align:start position:0%
many are actually convicted I think
 
01:33:41.699 --> 01:33:44.330 align:start position:0%
many are actually convicted I think
unfortunately

01:33:44.330 --> 01:33:44.340 align:start position:0%
unfortunately
 
01:33:46.490 --> 01:33:46.500 align:start position:0%
people involved in this can become very
 
01:33:48.830 --> 01:33:48.840 align:start position:0%
emotional and they can be somewhat I
 
01:33:50.570 --> 01:33:50.580 align:start position:0%
hate to use the word unscrupulous but
 
01:33:52.850 --> 01:33:52.860 align:start position:0%
they will use the court in order to get
 
01:33:54.830 --> 01:33:54.840 align:start position:0%
what they want against another parent
 
01:33:58.550 --> 01:33:58.560 align:start position:0%
and I'm afraid that that tends to be
 
01:33:58.560 --> 01:34:00.110 align:start position:0%
and I'm afraid that that tends to be
um

01:34:00.110 --> 01:34:00.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:34:04.970 --> 01:34:04.980 align:start position:0%
a little easy to do and in the system
 
01:34:06.890 --> 01:34:06.900 align:start position:0%
and I'm not saying it happens a lot I'm
 
01:34:08.750 --> 01:34:08.760 align:start position:0%
just saying that it there is a means for
 
01:34:10.490 --> 01:34:10.500 align:start position:0%
that to happen and I I think we need to
 
01:34:12.169 --> 01:34:12.179 align:start position:0%
somehow figure out how to close that
 
01:34:12.179 --> 01:34:13.610 align:start position:0%
somehow figure out how to close that
loophole

01:34:13.610 --> 01:34:13.620 align:start position:0%
loophole
 
01:34:15.050 --> 01:34:15.060 align:start position:0%
um one of the things that was brought up
 
01:34:17.209 --> 01:34:17.219 align:start position:0%
when we went to the Nashua court and I
 
01:34:20.030 --> 01:34:20.040 align:start position:0%
was quite shocked by is two of the cases
 
01:34:22.669 --> 01:34:22.679 align:start position:0%
that we listened to
 
01:34:22.679 --> 01:34:24.350 align:start position:0%
that we listened to
both

01:34:24.350 --> 01:34:24.360 align:start position:0%
both
 
01:34:26.689 --> 01:34:26.699 align:start position:0%
um times the children were allowed to be
 
01:34:29.090 --> 01:34:29.100 align:start position:0%
taken out of state
 
01:34:31.729 --> 01:34:31.739 align:start position:0%
um but there didn't and in both cases
 
01:34:34.669 --> 01:34:34.679 align:start position:0%
there didn't seem to be a mechanism to
 
01:34:36.169 --> 01:34:36.179 align:start position:0%
get them back into the state for
 
01:34:39.530 --> 01:34:39.540 align:start position:0%
visitations and I I was confused by that
 
01:34:42.229 --> 01:34:42.239 align:start position:0%
and and very concerned
 
01:34:44.629 --> 01:34:44.639 align:start position:0%
um that that was happening and I'm sure
 
01:34:46.970 --> 01:34:46.980 align:start position:0%
there was a reason for it but I do think
 
01:34:49.490 --> 01:34:49.500 align:start position:0%
that's something that also if we are
 
01:34:51.350 --> 01:34:51.360 align:start position:0%
going to allow children out of state we
 
01:34:52.910 --> 01:34:52.920 align:start position:0%
do need to make sure we're setting up a
 
01:34:55.490 --> 01:34:55.500 align:start position:0%
way so that the parent who is still here
 
01:34:58.129 --> 01:34:58.139 align:start position:0%
is not incurring Financial hardships in
 
01:35:00.770 --> 01:35:00.780 align:start position:0%
order to try and get visitation with
 
01:35:03.770 --> 01:35:03.780 align:start position:0%
their children thank you
 
01:35:03.780 --> 01:35:05.810 align:start position:0%
their children thank you
representative

01:35:05.810 --> 01:35:05.820 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:35:07.430 --> 01:35:07.440 align:start position:0%
um I have a question from my colleague
 
01:35:09.770 --> 01:35:09.780 align:start position:0%
um representative McMahon when people
 
01:35:11.689 --> 01:35:11.699 align:start position:0%
are bringing or your own interest in
 
01:35:13.189 --> 01:35:13.199 align:start position:0%
having the Rules of Evidence in the
 
01:35:14.450 --> 01:35:14.460 align:start position:0%
Family Court are they specifically
 
01:35:17.390 --> 01:35:17.400 align:start position:0%
mentioning which rules they feel are are
 
01:35:21.169 --> 01:35:21.179 align:start position:0%
not adequately applied
 
01:35:23.629 --> 01:35:23.639 align:start position:0%
uh no weapons
 
01:35:26.090 --> 01:35:26.100 align:start position:0%
not that I on the reading I've done and
 
01:35:28.250 --> 01:35:28.260 align:start position:0%
the observations uh don't even asked
 
01:35:29.629 --> 01:35:29.639 align:start position:0%
that's a question on that there's not
 
01:35:32.090 --> 01:35:32.100 align:start position:0%
been a specificity it's just the the
 
01:35:34.790 --> 01:35:34.800 align:start position:0%
global statement that Rules of Evidence
 
01:35:38.450 --> 01:35:38.460 align:start position:0%
are not applicable in Family Court
 
01:35:40.729 --> 01:35:40.739 align:start position:0%
so I'm wondering and of course chair
 
01:35:43.370 --> 01:35:43.380 align:start position:0%
Pierre would be personal part that one
 
01:35:46.070 --> 01:35:46.080 align:start position:0%
might be a good role play for us
 
01:35:50.209 --> 01:35:50.219 align:start position:0%
um to be in court and see if we being
 
01:35:51.830 --> 01:35:51.840 align:start position:0%
pro se
 
01:35:53.510 --> 01:35:53.520 align:start position:0%
um could get a document in like a
 
01:35:57.229 --> 01:35:57.239 align:start position:0%
screenshot of uh your partner saying I
 
01:35:58.790 --> 01:35:58.800 align:start position:0%
don't care I'm going to drive them drunk
 
01:36:02.330 --> 01:36:02.340 align:start position:0%
because uh it doesn't matter because you
 
01:36:04.189 --> 01:36:04.199 align:start position:0%
don't you know I I can do whatever I
 
01:36:06.410 --> 01:36:06.420 align:start position:0%
want and I'm driving I'm driving so you
 
01:36:07.610 --> 01:36:07.620 align:start position:0%
know if you had that screenshot and you
 
01:36:09.830 --> 01:36:09.840 align:start position:0%
brought it into court I would be
 
01:36:11.689 --> 01:36:11.699 align:start position:0%
surprised if we had the Rules of
 
01:36:14.870 --> 01:36:14.880 align:start position:0%
Evidence in in effect if a pro se person
 
01:36:17.149 --> 01:36:17.159 align:start position:0%
would be able to easily authenticate
 
01:36:19.310 --> 01:36:19.320 align:start position:0%
that document and get it accepted what
 
01:36:21.169 --> 01:36:21.179 align:start position:0%
we have now with the Rules of Evidence
 
01:36:23.390 --> 01:36:23.400 align:start position:0%
don't don't strictly apply they do apply
 
01:36:24.890 --> 01:36:24.900 align:start position:0%
I mean I I it's amazing because
 
01:36:27.110 --> 01:36:27.120 align:start position:0%
generally they are applying but not in
 
01:36:28.850 --> 01:36:28.860 align:start position:0%
the strictest sense but if you had that
 
01:36:31.370 --> 01:36:31.380 align:start position:0%
screenshot the judge might if they want
 
01:36:33.410 --> 01:36:33.420 align:start position:0%
you could say do you do you recognize
 
01:36:35.209 --> 01:36:35.219 align:start position:0%
this does this a text you did is this
 
01:36:36.830 --> 01:36:36.840 align:start position:0%
you know is this something you know do
 
01:36:38.390 --> 01:36:38.400 align:start position:0%
you uh do you uh you know authenticated
 
01:36:40.129 --> 01:36:40.139 align:start position:0%
that way instead of having to either
 
01:36:42.530 --> 01:36:42.540 align:start position:0%
have you know phone records or
 
01:36:44.689 --> 01:36:44.699 align:start position:0%
certification or just the whole line of
 
01:36:46.010 --> 01:36:46.020 align:start position:0%
questioning you know have time and date
 
01:36:48.590 --> 01:36:48.600 align:start position:0%
so I think we heard from some some of
 
01:36:50.750 --> 01:36:50.760 align:start position:0%
the judicial some of the officers saying
 
01:36:52.790 --> 01:36:52.800 align:start position:0%
that I do it so people can get stuff
 
01:36:55.010 --> 01:36:55.020 align:start position:0%
like that in so that's why I'm wondering
 
01:36:57.050 --> 01:36:57.060 align:start position:0%
what rules you know are people upset
 
01:36:59.149 --> 01:36:59.159 align:start position:0%
about the other thing is when you you
 
01:37:01.729 --> 01:37:01.739 align:start position:0%
know if you hearsay I mean can you not
 
01:37:04.129 --> 01:37:04.139 align:start position:0%
say you know my 10 year old told me you
 
01:37:07.310 --> 01:37:07.320 align:start position:0%
know her mother put an iron on her you
 
01:37:08.870 --> 01:37:08.880 align:start position:0%
know well no you can't because that you
 
01:37:10.129 --> 01:37:10.139 align:start position:0%
know what I mean that's the Rules of
 
01:37:11.629 --> 01:37:11.639 align:start position:0%
Evidence are going to apply that's you
 
01:37:13.610 --> 01:37:13.620 align:start position:0%
know hearsay you can't bring it in so I
 
01:37:15.169 --> 01:37:15.179 align:start position:0%
think that's why we in New Hampshire
 
01:37:17.510 --> 01:37:17.520 align:start position:0%
have allowed them to be lacks not
 
01:37:19.310 --> 01:37:19.320 align:start position:0%
strictly or technically applied because
 
01:37:22.010 --> 01:37:22.020 align:start position:0%
they do apply but I I really that's why
 
01:37:24.169 --> 01:37:24.179 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering what what rules
 
01:37:26.390 --> 01:37:26.400 align:start position:0%
all of them or some of them and what
 
01:37:28.370 --> 01:37:28.380 align:start position:0%
would really be the impact and I know
 
01:37:31.070 --> 01:37:31.080 align:start position:0%
that for me it as a practitioner I I
 
01:37:32.750 --> 01:37:32.760 align:start position:0%
don't get stuff in because I don't know
 
01:37:33.950 --> 01:37:33.960 align:start position:0%
the rules well enough of evidence
 
01:37:33.960 --> 01:37:35.270 align:start position:0%
the rules well enough of evidence
sometimes

01:37:35.270 --> 01:37:35.280 align:start position:0%
sometimes
 
01:37:36.649 --> 01:37:36.659 align:start position:0%
um so
 
01:37:38.629 --> 01:37:38.639 align:start position:0%
um I'm just I would be concerned with
 
01:37:40.910 --> 01:37:40.920 align:start position:0%
the amount of pro se people we have but
 
01:37:42.830 --> 01:37:42.840 align:start position:0%
if you if people are specifically
 
01:37:44.209 --> 01:37:44.219 align:start position:0%
talking about certain rules that they
 
01:37:45.890 --> 01:37:45.900 align:start position:0%
have a problem with I would like to know
 
01:37:47.450 --> 01:37:47.460 align:start position:0%
that and that would be helpful I think
 
01:37:49.310 --> 01:37:49.320 align:start position:0%
and that also goes back to maybe
 
01:37:51.530 --> 01:37:51.540 align:start position:0%
educating people that are pro se in the
 
01:37:54.169 --> 01:37:54.179 align:start position:0%
front end you know this is you know
 
01:37:55.669 --> 01:37:55.679 align:start position:0%
you're going to be held to this level of
 
01:37:57.350 --> 01:37:57.360 align:start position:0%
performance or you're not going to be
 
01:37:59.510 --> 01:37:59.520 align:start position:0%
able to bring in stuff that
 
01:38:01.610 --> 01:38:01.620 align:start position:0%
um you know so you can't bring in a
 
01:38:02.990 --> 01:38:03.000 align:start position:0%
doctor's report that's just a copy of
 
01:38:04.310 --> 01:38:04.320 align:start position:0%
what they've given you you know that
 
01:38:06.229 --> 01:38:06.239 align:start position:0%
that's not going to be okay can't bring
 
01:38:07.970 --> 01:38:07.980 align:start position:0%
in attendance forever that's just a copy
 
01:38:09.530 --> 01:38:09.540 align:start position:0%
I mean you'd have to if the Rules of
 
01:38:11.450 --> 01:38:11.460 align:start position:0%
Evidence applied you know it's got to be
 
01:38:13.129 --> 01:38:13.139 align:start position:0%
authenticated properly a proper
 
01:38:14.510 --> 01:38:14.520 align:start position:0%
Foundation laid
 
01:38:14.520 --> 01:38:15.729 align:start position:0%
Foundation laid
so

01:38:15.729 --> 01:38:15.739 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:38:18.490 --> 01:38:18.500 align:start position:0%
excuse me
 
01:38:22.850 --> 01:38:22.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:25.850 --> 01:38:25.860 align:start position:0%
okay go I'll if I may offer something to
 
01:38:29.270 --> 01:38:29.280 align:start position:0%
that uh I'll uh I understand what you're
 
01:38:31.310 --> 01:38:31.320 align:start position:0%
saying as part of the uh considered part
 
01:38:33.350 --> 01:38:33.360 align:start position:0%
of our narrative that we've heard here
 
01:38:35.270 --> 01:38:35.280 align:start position:0%
as our committee and one thing I've
 
01:38:38.090 --> 01:38:38.100 align:start position:0%
learned here before getting to where the
 
01:38:41.870 --> 01:38:41.880 align:start position:0%
the judge is making this uh decisions on
 
01:38:44.870 --> 01:38:44.880 align:start position:0%
what has been heard we have the two
 
01:38:46.669 --> 01:38:46.679 align:start position:0%
other two other avenues which is you
 
01:38:48.229 --> 01:38:48.239 align:start position:0%
know mediation and then the new one that
 
01:38:49.669 --> 01:38:49.679 align:start position:0%
I've learned I think with other members
 
01:38:52.310 --> 01:38:52.320 align:start position:0%
was the neutral case evaluation uh
 
01:38:55.310 --> 01:38:55.320 align:start position:0%
alternative before or hopefully not
 
01:38:57.830 --> 01:38:57.840 align:start position:0%
needing to go to the authority having
 
01:39:00.110 --> 01:39:00.120 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction being the judge
 
01:39:03.350 --> 01:39:03.360 align:start position:0%
but notwithstanding uh that Avenue and
 
01:39:05.030 --> 01:39:05.040 align:start position:0%
where and that's where Pro Se I would
 
01:39:07.790 --> 01:39:07.800 align:start position:0%
say has much more influence
 
01:39:09.709 --> 01:39:09.719 align:start position:0%
um because they're on an even playing
 
01:39:12.290 --> 01:39:12.300 align:start position:0%
field you know in terms of trying to
 
01:39:13.729 --> 01:39:13.739 align:start position:0%
come to a Cooperative collaboration to
 
01:39:16.790 --> 01:39:16.800 align:start position:0%
achieve consensus but before the uh
 
01:39:19.669 --> 01:39:19.679 align:start position:0%
going before uh before the the judge it
 
01:39:19.679 --> 01:39:20.570 align:start position:0%
going before uh before the the judge it
was

01:39:20.570 --> 01:39:20.580 align:start position:0%
was
 
01:39:23.810 --> 01:39:23.820 align:start position:0%
been uh and I'm not in front I'm in
 
01:39:25.310 --> 01:39:25.320 align:start position:0%
front of the judge I'll stipulate that
 
01:39:26.750 --> 01:39:26.760 align:start position:0%
that has not been the case I'm happy to
 
01:39:29.750 --> 01:39:29.760 align:start position:0%
tell you but the uh fact is it's either
 
01:39:31.910 --> 01:39:31.920 align:start position:0%
you're a dog or a cat and do you do the
 
01:39:33.410 --> 01:39:33.420 align:start position:0%
Rules of Evidence allowed the answer is
 
01:39:36.229 --> 01:39:36.239 align:start position:0%
no by allowed meaning they're not a
 
01:39:38.750 --> 01:39:38.760 align:start position:0%
pursuant to family court cases and
 
01:39:40.490 --> 01:39:40.500 align:start position:0%
should we and when I'm suggesting we
 
01:39:42.590 --> 01:39:42.600 align:start position:0%
consider in our discussions cross that
 
01:39:44.750 --> 01:39:44.760 align:start position:0%
bridge to say Rules of Evidence shall
 
01:39:46.910 --> 01:39:46.920 align:start position:0%
apply and here what they here's what the
 
01:39:49.490 --> 01:39:49.500 align:start position:0%
Rules of Evidence specifically are so
 
01:39:52.070 --> 01:39:52.080 align:start position:0%
there's no misinterpretation of intent
 
01:39:53.510 --> 01:39:53.520 align:start position:0%
and that's just what I've that's what
 
01:39:54.890 --> 01:39:54.900 align:start position:0%
I've known here when and then to hear
 
01:39:56.629 --> 01:39:56.639 align:start position:0%
this case we're just going to cop copy
 
01:39:59.629 --> 01:39:59.639 align:start position:0%
of that says it doesn't apply
 
01:40:01.490 --> 01:40:01.500 align:start position:0%
and uh and so if I go in there am I
 
01:40:04.310 --> 01:40:04.320 align:start position:0%
fully armed in my particular case or is
 
01:40:07.010 --> 01:40:07.020 align:start position:0%
it based on if the if the authority uh
 
01:40:08.810 --> 01:40:08.820 align:start position:0%
likes me that day or did I tell the
 
01:40:10.910 --> 01:40:10.920 align:start position:0%
right word that day not dealing with
 
01:40:13.729 --> 01:40:13.739 align:start position:0%
evidence but how I present the case one
 
01:40:17.090 --> 01:40:17.100 align:start position:0%
on either side on on in Family Court
 
01:40:20.149 --> 01:40:20.159 align:start position:0%
and that's why I find to be to be uh of
 
01:40:22.129 --> 01:40:22.139 align:start position:0%
how do you um not level the playing
 
01:40:25.129 --> 01:40:25.139 align:start position:0%
field but can we get on the field with
 
01:40:27.890 --> 01:40:27.900 align:start position:0%
the equal access to the tools
 
01:40:32.090 --> 01:40:32.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:32.100 --> 01:40:34.070 align:start position:0%
 
representative

01:40:34.070 --> 01:40:34.080 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:40:34.080 --> 01:40:35.810 align:start position:0%
representative
so

01:40:35.810 --> 01:40:35.820 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:40:37.850 --> 01:40:37.860 align:start position:0%
um following up on that I think one of
 
01:40:39.709 --> 01:40:39.719 align:start position:0%
the things that we did here regarding
 
01:40:41.330 --> 01:40:41.340 align:start position:0%
the Rules of Evidence
 
01:40:41.340 --> 01:40:42.770 align:start position:0%
the Rules of Evidence
um

01:40:42.770 --> 01:40:42.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:40:45.770 --> 01:40:45.780 align:start position:0%
was really people wanting to have the
 
01:40:48.169 --> 01:40:48.179 align:start position:0%
discovery regulations enforced so that
 
01:40:49.850 --> 01:40:49.860 align:start position:0%
somebody couldn't spring evidence on
 
01:40:51.290 --> 01:40:51.300 align:start position:0%
somebody that they hadn't previously
 
01:40:53.689 --> 01:40:53.699 align:start position:0%
seen and it seemed like
 
01:40:55.490 --> 01:40:55.500 align:start position:0%
and I did actually hear this and I I
 
01:40:57.110 --> 01:40:57.120 align:start position:0%
don't know Macbeth if you've experienced
 
01:40:59.450 --> 01:40:59.460 align:start position:0%
this but I've heard from some attorneys
 
01:41:01.610 --> 01:41:01.620 align:start position:0%
as well that you know sometimes the
 
01:41:05.209 --> 01:41:05.219 align:start position:0%
judges are are very strict on
 
01:41:07.490 --> 01:41:07.500 align:start position:0%
that you needed to meet the timeline to
 
01:41:09.410 --> 01:41:09.420 align:start position:0%
to give your Discovery but then
 
01:41:10.850 --> 01:41:10.860 align:start position:0%
sometimes they're more lacks about it
 
01:41:12.830 --> 01:41:12.840 align:start position:0%
where if it was due 10 days before and
 
01:41:14.930 --> 01:41:14.940 align:start position:0%
you gave it the day before
 
01:41:14.940 --> 01:41:15.770 align:start position:0%
you gave it the day before
um

01:41:15.770 --> 01:41:15.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:41:17.030 --> 01:41:17.040 align:start position:0%
you're going to be in trouble for that
 
01:41:19.010 --> 01:41:19.020 align:start position:0%
verse sometimes they just ignore it and
 
01:41:20.930 --> 01:41:20.940 align:start position:0%
it depends on the the day it's not even
 
01:41:22.729 --> 01:41:22.739 align:start position:0%
necessarily the judge
 
01:41:24.890 --> 01:41:24.900 align:start position:0%
um have you experienced that because I
 
01:41:26.689 --> 01:41:26.699 align:start position:0%
that is something that I also heard as
 
01:41:29.090 --> 01:41:29.100 align:start position:0%
well like with an issue
 
01:41:31.129 --> 01:41:31.139 align:start position:0%
I don't I don't think I've experienced
 
01:41:33.410 --> 01:41:33.420 align:start position:0%
that wild swing but I think that's I've
 
01:41:36.169 --> 01:41:36.179 align:start position:0%
heard complaints about from testimony
 
01:41:37.910 --> 01:41:37.920 align:start position:0%
people not being allowed to provide
 
01:41:39.590 --> 01:41:39.600 align:start position:0%
their you know make their argument or
 
01:41:40.970 --> 01:41:40.980 align:start position:0%
whatever they were cut off by the judge
 
01:41:43.729 --> 01:41:43.739 align:start position:0%
but they didn't bring it before so I
 
01:41:45.950 --> 01:41:45.960 align:start position:0%
mean what's the what's the and I think
 
01:41:47.990 --> 01:41:48.000 align:start position:0%
also that's a good thing about one judge
 
01:41:49.490 --> 01:41:49.500 align:start position:0%
one case I mean if you've got they've
 
01:41:51.050 --> 01:41:51.060 align:start position:0%
been working together and they know that
 
01:41:52.669 --> 01:41:52.679 align:start position:0%
this guy's all or This Woman's always a
 
01:41:54.830 --> 01:41:54.840 align:start position:0%
little bit late you know like I was I'm
 
01:41:55.910 --> 01:41:55.920 align:start position:0%
always late I don't know what's wrong
 
01:41:58.010 --> 01:41:58.020 align:start position:0%
and it's this phase of my you know they
 
01:42:00.410 --> 01:42:00.420 align:start position:0%
may I I mean they have the flexibility
 
01:42:02.990 --> 01:42:03.000 align:start position:0%
to work with that but no I don't I don't
 
01:42:04.970 --> 01:42:04.980 align:start position:0%
see the wild swings that
 
01:42:06.470 --> 01:42:06.480 align:start position:0%
um I think they're pretty consistent and
 
01:42:08.390 --> 01:42:08.400 align:start position:0%
I think what they generally do is try to
 
01:42:10.430 --> 01:42:10.440 align:start position:0%
like the parties you know if it's nine
 
01:42:12.410 --> 01:42:12.420 align:start position:0%
days or the day before they've both done
 
01:42:14.030 --> 01:42:14.040 align:start position:0%
it like that that one person hasn't had
 
01:42:16.490 --> 01:42:16.500 align:start position:0%
a none but and you can always if you
 
01:42:18.470 --> 01:42:18.480 align:start position:0%
know you can always request a
 
01:42:19.850 --> 01:42:19.860 align:start position:0%
continuance because you haven't been
 
01:42:22.430 --> 01:42:22.440 align:start position:0%
able to provide that information but you
 
01:42:24.530 --> 01:42:24.540 align:start position:0%
may not know how to articulate that if
 
01:42:26.510 --> 01:42:26.520 align:start position:0%
you're Pro Se and you may not also know
 
01:42:28.370 --> 01:42:28.380 align:start position:0%
that they've got to hold it 10 days
 
01:42:29.750 --> 01:42:29.760 align:start position:0%
unless you get the other parties are
 
01:42:31.609 --> 01:42:31.619 align:start position:0%
sent and they you know so there's all
 
01:42:33.530 --> 01:42:33.540 align:start position:0%
those things and I just want to say I am
 
01:42:36.290 --> 01:42:36.300 align:start position:0%
going to bring Rules of Evidence I mean
 
01:42:39.169 --> 01:42:39.179 align:start position:0%
it is it is not a one-pager you know
 
01:42:41.030 --> 01:42:41.040 align:start position:0%
they might have it at Kinkos at one page
 
01:42:42.950 --> 01:42:42.960 align:start position:0%
you know the rules of evidence but it
 
01:42:42.960 --> 01:42:43.910 align:start position:0%
you know the rules of evidence but it
it's

01:42:43.910 --> 01:42:43.920 align:start position:0%
it's
 
01:42:47.330 --> 01:42:47.340 align:start position:0%
it's a significant document that has
 
01:42:50.090 --> 01:42:50.100 align:start position:0%
been interpreted by you know practice
 
01:42:53.629 --> 01:42:53.639 align:start position:0%
and by a case law so
 
01:43:00.669 --> 01:43:00.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:02.810 --> 01:43:02.820 align:start position:0%
first representative one we haven't
 
01:43:04.330 --> 01:43:04.340 align:start position:0%
heard from you in a while and then
 
01:43:06.590 --> 01:43:06.600 align:start position:0%
representative Greg
 
01:43:09.410 --> 01:43:09.420 align:start position:0%
I think I'm Madam chair I sold the uh we
 
01:43:12.890 --> 01:43:12.900 align:start position:0%
we have heard uh specifics on evidence
 
01:43:14.990 --> 01:43:15.000 align:start position:0%
that wasn't allowed
 
01:43:18.050 --> 01:43:18.060 align:start position:0%
um however it's hard for myself to
 
01:43:21.290 --> 01:43:21.300 align:start position:0%
determine why the judge ruled in that
 
01:43:21.300 --> 01:43:22.790 align:start position:0%
determine why the judge ruled in that
case

01:43:22.790 --> 01:43:22.800 align:start position:0%
case
 
01:43:22.800 --> 01:43:23.390 align:start position:0%
case
um

01:43:23.390 --> 01:43:23.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:43:25.430 --> 01:43:25.440 align:start position:0%
the fact that judges are interpreting
 
01:43:28.129 --> 01:43:28.139 align:start position:0%
differently was an issue and that's a
 
01:43:31.310 --> 01:43:31.320 align:start position:0%
question I asked whether there's any
 
01:43:34.370 --> 01:43:34.380 align:start position:0%
um Career Training after three years
 
01:43:36.590 --> 01:43:36.600 align:start position:0%
four years seven years of being a judge
 
01:43:38.689 --> 01:43:38.699 align:start position:0%
and there isn't any
 
01:43:40.910 --> 01:43:40.920 align:start position:0%
um and I know in children and family law
 
01:43:44.870 --> 01:43:44.880 align:start position:0%
for years we've asked judges to attempt
 
01:43:47.750 --> 01:43:47.760 align:start position:0%
to get on the same page on bills that
 
01:43:50.330 --> 01:43:50.340 align:start position:0%
we've been hearing and that has really
 
01:43:52.790 --> 01:43:52.800 align:start position:0%
never come to fruition
 
01:43:52.800 --> 01:43:53.990 align:start position:0%
never come to fruition
um

01:43:53.990 --> 01:43:54.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:43:56.750 --> 01:43:56.760 align:start position:0%
because we we hear a lot of this that
 
01:43:59.990 --> 01:44:00.000 align:start position:0%
judge said X and on the same type of
 
01:44:01.490 --> 01:44:01.500 align:start position:0%
case this
 
01:44:03.590 --> 01:44:03.600 align:start position:0%
judge said see
 
01:44:05.689 --> 01:44:05.699 align:start position:0%
um so I
 
01:44:08.330 --> 01:44:08.340 align:start position:0%
again it's again it's training and
 
01:44:11.570 --> 01:44:11.580 align:start position:0%
continue continue training
 
01:44:13.430 --> 01:44:13.440 align:start position:0%
um thank you representative brick
 
01:44:16.129 --> 01:44:16.139 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair so you know then
 
01:44:18.169 --> 01:44:18.179 align:start position:0%
and just sitting here listening you know
 
01:44:20.330 --> 01:44:20.340 align:start position:0%
I'm contemplating this is so complicated
 
01:44:22.370 --> 01:44:22.380 align:start position:0%
family case it's even one case is
 
01:44:24.410 --> 01:44:24.420 align:start position:0%
incredibly complicated but the common
 
01:44:27.770 --> 01:44:27.780 align:start position:0%
denominator that keeps coming up when we
 
01:44:30.890 --> 01:44:30.900 align:start position:0%
have issues with cases is the pro se
 
01:44:33.470 --> 01:44:33.480 align:start position:0%
obviously we can't expect you know this
 
01:44:35.330 --> 01:44:35.340 align:start position:0%
is why in Criminal Court you know you
 
01:44:37.070 --> 01:44:37.080 align:start position:0%
have attorneys assigned we can't do that
 
01:44:39.229 --> 01:44:39.239 align:start position:0%
in family court it's not practical
 
01:44:41.390 --> 01:44:41.400 align:start position:0%
so I think one of the things we can do
 
01:44:43.430 --> 01:44:43.440 align:start position:0%
and you know is
 
01:44:45.649 --> 01:44:45.659 align:start position:0%
you know we can just recommend obviously
 
01:44:47.689 --> 01:44:47.699 align:start position:0%
we're not the judicial branch Branch I
 
01:44:49.070 --> 01:44:49.080 align:start position:0%
have a great respect for the judicial
 
01:44:50.570 --> 01:44:50.580 align:start position:0%
branch and all this work that they have
 
01:44:51.530 --> 01:44:51.540 align:start position:0%
to do
 
01:44:54.649 --> 01:44:54.659 align:start position:0%
but um is looking at there and I did not
 
01:44:56.450 --> 01:44:56.460 align:start position:0%
take the time that day to look down and
 
01:44:58.010 --> 01:44:58.020 align:start position:0%
if we're pro se we saw the computer
 
01:45:00.050 --> 01:45:00.060 align:start position:0%
where they can log in and do all the
 
01:45:02.030 --> 01:45:02.040 align:start position:0%
things to see what that is you know
 
01:45:04.970 --> 01:45:04.980 align:start position:0%
there are National recommendations on
 
01:45:07.310 --> 01:45:07.320 align:start position:0%
that kind of stuff like as to for the
 
01:45:08.990 --> 01:45:09.000 align:start position:0%
court systems as to what you could do as
 
01:45:11.149 --> 01:45:11.159 align:start position:0%
pro se but there is a certain level of
 
01:45:13.850 --> 01:45:13.860 align:start position:0%
personal responsibility
 
01:45:16.850 --> 01:45:16.860 align:start position:0%
um that that we can't fix you know the
 
01:45:18.530 --> 01:45:18.540 align:start position:0%
pro se because there's a lot of you know
 
01:45:20.870 --> 01:45:20.880 align:start position:0%
judges are trained years and years and
 
01:45:22.490 --> 01:45:22.500 align:start position:0%
years if somebody decides they're going
 
01:45:23.990 --> 01:45:24.000 align:start position:0%
to handle their own divorce case they
 
01:45:26.149 --> 01:45:26.159 align:start position:0%
maybe looked at Google you know for a
 
01:45:28.250 --> 01:45:28.260 align:start position:0%
few months or whatever and it's just
 
01:45:31.609 --> 01:45:31.619 align:start position:0%
very very different but I I from what we
 
01:45:34.370 --> 01:45:34.380 align:start position:0%
saw the judge was incredibly Fair we saw
 
01:45:38.410 --> 01:45:38.420 align:start position:0%
a lot of pro se you know very
 
01:45:41.090 --> 01:45:41.100 align:start position:0%
explanatory as far as okay you can't
 
01:45:43.970 --> 01:45:43.980 align:start position:0%
present this or you can or you have to
 
01:45:45.770 --> 01:45:45.780 align:start position:0%
make sure that the other person has this
 
01:45:48.290 --> 01:45:48.300 align:start position:0%
document too and and even you know
 
01:45:49.850 --> 01:45:49.860 align:start position:0%
making sure that they have at least a
 
01:45:52.550 --> 01:45:52.560 align:start position:0%
few minutes to look at it and stuff
 
01:45:55.250 --> 01:45:55.260 align:start position:0%
um but the pro se is really what we
 
01:45:57.350 --> 01:45:57.360 align:start position:0%
that's the common denominator is as far
 
01:46:00.109 --> 01:46:00.119 align:start position:0%
and I could stand corrected on this but
 
01:46:02.270 --> 01:46:02.280 align:start position:0%
almost every situation it's the pro se
 
01:46:04.970 --> 01:46:04.980 align:start position:0%
so what we can do is you know maybe make
 
01:46:06.229 --> 01:46:06.239 align:start position:0%
that recommendation there are certain
 
01:46:09.470 --> 01:46:09.480 align:start position:0%
things within gal or other things but to
 
01:46:11.450 --> 01:46:11.460 align:start position:0%
make sure that they have an easy to read
 
01:46:14.149 --> 01:46:14.159 align:start position:0%
system that's easily accessible you know
 
01:46:15.530 --> 01:46:15.540 align:start position:0%
where people can look this up and
 
01:46:17.149 --> 01:46:17.159 align:start position:0%
they're not relying on Google that maybe
 
01:46:19.189 --> 01:46:19.199 align:start position:0%
has information for other states or
 
01:46:21.590 --> 01:46:21.600 align:start position:0%
something that we have some direct thing
 
01:46:23.689 --> 01:46:23.699 align:start position:0%
that they can look at but then we can't
 
01:46:25.790 --> 01:46:25.800 align:start position:0%
negate personal responsibility once
 
01:46:27.229 --> 01:46:27.239 align:start position:0%
that's out there but we can take a
 
01:46:29.990 --> 01:46:30.000 align:start position:0%
better look at what what are we giving
 
01:46:33.770 --> 01:46:33.780 align:start position:0%
people who are either by choice or by
 
01:46:38.149 --> 01:46:38.159 align:start position:0%
economics doing the pro se situation and
 
01:46:39.830 --> 01:46:39.840 align:start position:0%
because that really seems like the
 
01:46:41.270 --> 01:46:41.280 align:start position:0%
common denominator
 
01:46:41.280 --> 01:46:42.229 align:start position:0%
common denominator
so

01:46:42.229 --> 01:46:42.239 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:46:45.590 --> 01:46:45.600 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representable
 
01:46:47.570 --> 01:46:47.580 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chairman
 
01:46:49.189 --> 01:46:49.199 align:start position:0%
um I do want to just bring up that
 
01:46:52.490 --> 01:46:52.500 align:start position:0%
attorney had told us that 80 percent of
 
01:46:54.109 --> 01:46:54.119 align:start position:0%
the cases
 
01:46:56.930 --> 01:46:56.940 align:start position:0%
um were pro-sag that wasn't here that
 
01:46:59.090 --> 01:46:59.100 align:start position:0%
was on the children children and family
 
01:47:01.310 --> 01:47:01.320 align:start position:0%
court so it is quite large
 
01:47:02.870 --> 01:47:02.880 align:start position:0%
um and it also was brought to our
 
01:47:04.430 --> 01:47:04.440 align:start position:0%
attention when we were in the Nashua
 
01:47:07.450 --> 01:47:07.460 align:start position:0%
court that the
 
01:47:08.750 --> 01:47:08.760 align:start position:0%
courts.newhampshire.gov has
 
01:47:11.629 --> 01:47:11.639 align:start position:0%
informational videos
 
01:47:15.410 --> 01:47:15.420 align:start position:0%
that are available to the general public
 
01:47:17.750 --> 01:47:17.760 align:start position:0%
to go on and learn things legal
 
01:47:20.270 --> 01:47:20.280 align:start position:0%
definitions what to expect in a court
 
01:47:22.729 --> 01:47:22.739 align:start position:0%
hearing what is an alternative to
 
01:47:24.649 --> 01:47:24.659 align:start position:0%
dispute resolution so there's quite an
 
01:47:26.930 --> 01:47:26.940 align:start position:0%
and access to legal assistance in New
 
01:47:28.250 --> 01:47:28.260 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so there's quite a bit that
 
01:47:30.470 --> 01:47:30.480 align:start position:0%
the court does offer the public and it
 
01:47:32.810 --> 01:47:32.820 align:start position:0%
might just be that perhaps we need to do
 
01:47:34.550 --> 01:47:34.560 align:start position:0%
a better job in making sure that people
 
01:47:36.109 --> 01:47:36.119 align:start position:0%
know that this is available to them
 
01:47:37.910 --> 01:47:37.920 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for that I think
 
01:47:37.920 --> 01:47:38.810 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for that I think
that

01:47:38.810 --> 01:47:38.820 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:47:41.450 --> 01:47:41.460 align:start position:0%
um that's a good follow-up of a
 
01:47:46.129 --> 01:47:46.139 align:start position:0%
representative Greg's comments that the
 
01:47:50.209 --> 01:47:50.219 align:start position:0%
issue of pro se is really a significant
 
01:47:52.609 --> 01:47:52.619 align:start position:0%
issue in terms of what works and what
 
01:47:56.870 --> 01:47:56.880 align:start position:0%
doesn't work in in the family court and
 
01:48:01.270 --> 01:48:01.280 align:start position:0%
add to that is her additional point that
 
01:48:03.950 --> 01:48:03.960 align:start position:0%
individuals nonetheless do have a
 
01:48:07.790 --> 01:48:07.800 align:start position:0%
personal obligation to to do the best
 
01:48:10.189 --> 01:48:10.199 align:start position:0%
that they can to find the information
 
01:48:13.129 --> 01:48:13.139 align:start position:0%
that they need when they make the
 
01:48:16.669 --> 01:48:16.679 align:start position:0%
decision to proceed Pro Se
 
01:48:20.090 --> 01:48:20.100 align:start position:0%
um I do want to I know that we are
 
01:48:23.390 --> 01:48:23.400 align:start position:0%
um if you're like me you are drowning in
 
01:48:25.250 --> 01:48:25.260 align:start position:0%
all of the paperwork that we have
 
01:48:27.770 --> 01:48:27.780 align:start position:0%
including some that
 
01:48:29.890 --> 01:48:29.900 align:start position:0%
um I did I looked at my little home
 
01:48:35.090 --> 01:48:35.100 align:start position:0%
printer and decided that the 385 page
 
01:48:39.430 --> 01:48:39.440 align:start position:0%
report was not going to be printed out
 
01:48:43.490 --> 01:48:43.500 align:start position:0%
even though I am so old-fashioned that
 
01:48:45.109 --> 01:48:45.119 align:start position:0%
to me the only way you should read
 
01:48:47.570 --> 01:48:47.580 align:start position:0%
something is to have it in your hands I
 
01:48:50.390 --> 01:48:50.400 align:start position:0%
I just don't like all this all this
 
01:48:52.370 --> 01:48:52.380 align:start position:0%
electronic stuff
 
01:48:55.550 --> 01:48:55.560 align:start position:0%
um but and I know that as diligent as
 
01:48:57.290 --> 01:48:57.300 align:start position:0%
each member of the committee has been
 
01:48:59.570 --> 01:48:59.580 align:start position:0%
you haven't been able to read everything
 
01:49:02.870 --> 01:49:02.880 align:start position:0%
but there have been some materials that
 
01:49:05.450 --> 01:49:05.460 align:start position:0%
have come to us over time that are quite
 
01:49:08.209 --> 01:49:08.219 align:start position:0%
relevant for example
 
01:49:12.229 --> 01:49:12.239 align:start position:0%
um Christian Grant had uh has sent to us
 
01:49:15.649 --> 01:49:15.659 align:start position:0%
something dated June 16th on the
 
01:49:17.689 --> 01:49:17.699 align:start position:0%
application of the Rules of Evidence in
 
01:49:19.609 --> 01:49:19.619 align:start position:0%
the Family Division of the circuit core
 
01:49:23.350 --> 01:49:23.360 align:start position:0%
and it is just a few pages long but
 
01:49:27.470 --> 01:49:27.480 align:start position:0%
summarizes the major cases that have
 
01:49:30.649 --> 01:49:30.659 align:start position:0%
been heard over over the years that
 
01:49:30.659 --> 01:49:32.689 align:start position:0%
been heard over over the years that
demonstrate

01:49:32.689 --> 01:49:32.699 align:start position:0%
demonstrate
 
01:49:32.699 --> 01:49:33.310 align:start position:0%
demonstrate
um

01:49:33.310 --> 01:49:33.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:49:36.109 --> 01:49:36.119 align:start position:0%
uh uh
 
01:49:39.050 --> 01:49:39.060 align:start position:0%
uh how the rules of evidence do or do
 
01:49:44.330 --> 01:49:44.340 align:start position:0%
not uh relate in in the court and
 
01:49:44.340 --> 01:49:45.350 align:start position:0%
not uh relate in in the court and
um

01:49:45.350 --> 01:49:45.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:49:48.410 --> 01:49:48.420 align:start position:0%
I mean the one paragraph that I just for
 
01:49:50.390 --> 01:49:50.400 align:start position:0%
the purposes of those who are listening
 
01:49:53.149 --> 01:49:53.159 align:start position:0%
to today that I would like to read is
 
01:49:55.490 --> 01:49:55.500 align:start position:0%
trial courts are afforded broad
 
01:49:57.770 --> 01:49:57.780 align:start position:0%
discretion in divorce matters and we
 
01:49:59.990 --> 01:50:00.000 align:start position:0%
will not overturn the trial Court's
 
01:50:02.750 --> 01:50:02.760 align:start position:0%
rulings regarding property settlement
 
01:50:06.410 --> 01:50:06.420 align:start position:0%
absent and abusive discretion or error
 
01:50:09.109 --> 01:50:09.119 align:start position:0%
of law to show an abusive distraction
 
01:50:11.629 --> 01:50:11.639 align:start position:0%
the petitioner must demonstrate that the
 
01:50:14.149 --> 01:50:14.159 align:start position:0%
Court's ruling was clearly untenable or
 
01:50:16.850 --> 01:50:16.860 align:start position:0%
unreasonable to the Prejudice of the
 
01:50:19.129 --> 01:50:19.139 align:start position:0%
case if there is some support in the
 
01:50:20.689 --> 01:50:20.699 align:start position:0%
record for the trial Court's
 
01:50:23.750 --> 01:50:23.760 align:start position:0%
determination we will uphold it and I
 
01:50:26.270 --> 01:50:26.280 align:start position:0%
think that reflects the need to
 
01:50:30.590 --> 01:50:30.600 align:start position:0%
understand with each case being unique
 
01:50:33.649 --> 01:50:33.659 align:start position:0%
certainly to the petitioners but also to
 
01:50:36.169 --> 01:50:36.179 align:start position:0%
all the other cases that there has to be
 
01:50:38.390 --> 01:50:38.400 align:start position:0%
some flexibility in the application of
 
01:50:41.149 --> 01:50:41.159 align:start position:0%
the rules of evidence and so I just
 
01:50:43.189 --> 01:50:43.199 align:start position:0%
point this out as an example of
 
01:50:45.950 --> 01:50:45.960 align:start position:0%
something of one of many of of the
 
01:50:47.750 --> 01:50:47.760 align:start position:0%
documents that you have that you'll be
 
01:50:50.930 --> 01:50:50.940 align:start position:0%
able to spend some time reading it's now
 
01:50:53.450 --> 01:50:53.460 align:start position:0%
looking at the at the clock I want to
 
01:50:56.990 --> 01:50:57.000 align:start position:0%
say to you all how very much I
 
01:50:57.000 --> 01:50:58.189 align:start position:0%
say to you all how very much I
appreciate

01:50:58.189 --> 01:50:58.199 align:start position:0%
appreciate
 
01:51:00.530 --> 01:51:00.540 align:start position:0%
the time that you've put in
 
01:51:03.169 --> 01:51:03.179 align:start position:0%
all these weeks up until now and this
 
01:51:07.149 --> 01:51:07.159 align:start position:0%
morning and I liked it from now until
 
01:51:10.370 --> 01:51:10.380 align:start position:0%
the end of this morning session see if
 
01:51:16.689 --> 01:51:16.699 align:start position:0%
we can identify just a few major
 
01:51:19.129 --> 01:51:19.139 align:start position:0%
components um
 
01:51:23.030 --> 01:51:23.040 align:start position:0%
of our discussion that we might want to
 
01:51:26.570 --> 01:51:26.580 align:start position:0%
do some digging into between now and
 
01:51:26.580 --> 01:51:28.070 align:start position:0%
do some digging into between now and
September

01:51:28.070 --> 01:51:28.080 align:start position:0%
September
 
01:51:31.129 --> 01:51:31.139 align:start position:0%
um representative kotek so if I may
 
01:51:34.490 --> 01:51:34.500 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair one I I did break
 
01:51:37.010 --> 01:51:37.020 align:start position:0%
up kind of what everybody said into two
 
01:51:39.169 --> 01:51:39.179 align:start position:0%
pages one being legislative changes and
 
01:51:40.790 --> 01:51:40.800 align:start position:0%
one being possibly like things that we
 
01:51:42.649 --> 01:51:42.659 align:start position:0%
might be able to work with the with the
 
01:51:44.750 --> 01:51:44.760 align:start position:0%
court for you know kind of best more
 
01:51:46.729 --> 01:51:46.739 align:start position:0%
best practices it might be Court things
 
01:51:49.010 --> 01:51:49.020 align:start position:0%
but not necessarily legislative changes
 
01:51:50.990 --> 01:51:51.000 align:start position:0%
so I kind of wrote them all down and I
 
01:51:53.209 --> 01:51:53.219 align:start position:0%
wonder if I can maybe go by topic and we
 
01:51:54.950 --> 01:51:54.960 align:start position:0%
could say if we do want to move forward
 
01:51:56.750 --> 01:51:56.760 align:start position:0%
with it and if so like who maybe wants
 
01:51:58.310 --> 01:51:58.320 align:start position:0%
to work on that would that work sounds
 
01:52:00.830 --> 01:52:00.840 align:start position:0%
like a great idea okay so the first one
 
01:52:04.129 --> 01:52:04.139 align:start position:0%
that was raised was gal and the role of
 
01:52:07.430 --> 01:52:07.440 align:start position:0%
gal and I know that you had raised that
 
01:52:10.070 --> 01:52:10.080 align:start position:0%
um Greg so I don't if we still want to
 
01:52:11.810 --> 01:52:11.820 align:start position:0%
look into that if there's those who
 
01:52:12.830 --> 01:52:12.840 align:start position:0%
might wanna
 
01:52:14.810 --> 01:52:14.820 align:start position:0%
could could I ask could you read them
 
01:52:16.910 --> 01:52:16.920 align:start position:0%
all first I'm I'm so visual I mean I'd
 
01:52:18.169 --> 01:52:18.179 align:start position:0%
like to know what how many I mean or
 
01:52:19.729 --> 01:52:19.739 align:start position:0%
just give me are there like 12 on each
 
01:52:21.530 --> 01:52:21.540 align:start position:0%
side or whatever so for legislative
 
01:52:23.390 --> 01:52:23.400 align:start position:0%
changes this is what I have so the role
 
01:52:24.530 --> 01:52:24.540 align:start position:0%
of gal
 
01:52:26.390 --> 01:52:26.400 align:start position:0%
um the neutral case evaluation possible
 
01:52:28.070 --> 01:52:28.080 align:start position:0%
expansion of it
 
01:52:31.250 --> 01:52:31.260 align:start position:0%
um Family Law training slash continuing
 
01:52:34.129 --> 01:52:34.139 align:start position:0%
education for judges
 
01:52:37.910 --> 01:52:37.920 align:start position:0%
um the presumption of shared parenting
 
01:52:41.570 --> 01:52:41.580 align:start position:0%
um Child Support guideline fixes
 
01:52:45.169 --> 01:52:45.179 align:start position:0%
um timelines for cases and then
 
01:52:48.770 --> 01:52:48.780 align:start position:0%
visitation for at-risk kids and um then
 
01:52:50.689 --> 01:52:50.699 align:start position:0%
on the court rules side slash best
 
01:52:52.910 --> 01:52:52.920 align:start position:0%
practices side I have
 
01:52:54.410 --> 01:52:54.420 align:start position:0%
um looking into potentially staff
 
01:52:57.770 --> 01:52:57.780 align:start position:0%
helping with forms and pro se parties
 
01:53:00.229 --> 01:53:00.239 align:start position:0%
um the one judge one family being
 
01:53:00.239 --> 01:53:01.970 align:start position:0%
um the one judge one family being
enforced

01:53:01.970 --> 01:53:01.980 align:start position:0%
enforced
 
01:53:04.189 --> 01:53:04.199 align:start position:0%
um you had mentioned broadly just kind
 
01:53:07.310 --> 01:53:07.320 align:start position:0%
of best practice guidelines and and that
 
01:53:10.430 --> 01:53:10.440 align:start position:0%
being explored and then
 
01:53:13.010 --> 01:53:13.020 align:start position:0%
Rules of Evidence slash Discovery
 
01:53:13.020 --> 01:53:14.629 align:start position:0%
Rules of Evidence slash Discovery
regulations

01:53:14.629 --> 01:53:14.639 align:start position:0%
regulations
 
01:53:16.129 --> 01:53:16.139 align:start position:0%
um you know
 
01:53:19.129 --> 01:53:19.139 align:start position:0%
being enforced and um
 
01:53:21.290 --> 01:53:21.300 align:start position:0%
more widely available so that's kind of
 
01:53:22.910 --> 01:53:22.920 align:start position:0%
what I have on both sides of the list
 
01:53:27.169 --> 01:53:27.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:29.810 --> 01:53:29.820 align:start position:0%
just looking at the oh sorry can I talk
 
01:53:31.609 --> 01:53:31.619 align:start position:0%
go ahead thank you madam chair just
 
01:53:33.709 --> 01:53:33.719 align:start position:0%
looking at that um I don't know if that
 
01:53:35.689 --> 01:53:35.699 align:start position:0%
falls into the forms or whatever but
 
01:53:37.310 --> 01:53:37.320 align:start position:0%
kind of looking at the system they have
 
01:53:39.169 --> 01:53:39.179 align:start position:0%
because there is a national like um
 
01:53:41.629 --> 01:53:41.639 align:start position:0%
recommendation for uh family courts and
 
01:53:43.669 --> 01:53:43.679 align:start position:0%
stuff as far as
 
01:53:45.350 --> 01:53:45.360 align:start position:0%
um what kind of information they help
 
01:53:47.390 --> 01:53:47.400 align:start position:0%
for like Pro Se litigant so that would
 
01:53:48.590 --> 01:53:48.600 align:start position:0%
be something I don't guess that would be
 
01:53:50.390 --> 01:53:50.400 align:start position:0%
a best practices does that fill in with
 
01:53:52.370 --> 01:53:52.380 align:start position:0%
your are you doing that as part of Staff
 
01:53:55.250 --> 01:53:55.260 align:start position:0%
helping yeah so that was on the first
 
01:53:57.169 --> 01:53:57.179 align:start position:0%
thing like with with the forms and the
 
01:53:58.970 --> 01:53:58.980 align:start position:0%
pro se parties that is on the first
 
01:54:01.129 --> 01:54:01.139 align:start position:0%
that's the first item on the the court
 
01:54:05.290 --> 01:54:05.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:08.090 --> 01:54:08.100 align:start position:0%
thank you so one one question I have
 
01:54:09.950 --> 01:54:09.960 align:start position:0%
about the topics listed and I didn't get
 
01:54:11.810 --> 01:54:11.820 align:start position:0%
them all written down is some of them
 
01:54:13.189 --> 01:54:13.199 align:start position:0%
were mentioned here and they are
 
01:54:15.530 --> 01:54:15.540 align:start position:0%
important policy issues but they're not
 
01:54:17.810 --> 01:54:17.820 align:start position:0%
to our charge to look at specifically
 
01:54:20.450 --> 01:54:20.460 align:start position:0%
the Family Division so I think those
 
01:54:22.850 --> 01:54:22.860 align:start position:0%
things I mean I I actually would kind of
 
01:54:24.350 --> 01:54:24.360 align:start position:0%
like to look at them all I mean like
 
01:54:26.390 --> 01:54:26.400 align:start position:0%
reviewing child support guidelines that
 
01:54:28.850 --> 01:54:28.860 align:start position:0%
is a huge thing and that's not the
 
01:54:30.290 --> 01:54:30.300 align:start position:0%
that's not the
 
01:54:34.209 --> 01:54:34.219 align:start position:0%
um family port division that's the
 
01:54:36.709 --> 01:54:36.719 align:start position:0%
legislation I mean that's policy you
 
01:54:38.570 --> 01:54:38.580 align:start position:0%
know somewhere beyond that so I'm I'm
 
01:54:40.910 --> 01:54:40.920 align:start position:0%
not sure well that's this side is
 
01:54:42.709 --> 01:54:42.719 align:start position:0%
legislative changes so these are like
 
01:54:44.750 --> 01:54:44.760 align:start position:0%
possible policy changes that we would
 
01:54:47.209 --> 01:54:47.219 align:start position:0%
make with bells versus more just
 
01:54:50.330 --> 01:54:50.340 align:start position:0%
recommendations for the court that we
 
01:54:51.950 --> 01:54:51.960 align:start position:0%
might recommend to them but we're not
 
01:54:53.750 --> 01:54:53.760 align:start position:0%
going to put this into legislation so I
 
01:54:55.790 --> 01:54:55.800 align:start position:0%
do agree like this this is the side with
 
01:54:57.770 --> 01:54:57.780 align:start position:0%
that may be fixed with a bell verse this
 
01:55:01.010 --> 01:55:01.020 align:start position:0%
is not going to have legislation with it
 
01:55:04.729 --> 01:55:04.739 align:start position:0%
so could you um so there's seven things
 
01:55:06.410 --> 01:55:06.420 align:start position:0%
on the legislative side and then there
 
01:55:08.270 --> 01:55:08.280 align:start position:0%
was four main areas on the Court rule
 
01:55:10.070 --> 01:55:10.080 align:start position:0%
side so we're looking at like 11 things
 
01:55:12.050 --> 01:55:12.060 align:start position:0%
here so let's go back to the legislative
 
01:55:14.990 --> 01:55:15.000 align:start position:0%
forms one judge one case best practice
 
01:55:16.370 --> 01:55:16.380 align:start position:0%
and what was the fourth Rules of
 
01:55:19.850 --> 01:55:19.860 align:start position:0%
Evidence okay so slash Discovery
 
01:55:22.729 --> 01:55:22.739 align:start position:0%
regulations oh yeah okay and the other
 
01:55:22.739 --> 01:55:23.570 align:start position:0%
regulations oh yeah okay and the other
list

01:55:23.570 --> 01:55:23.580 align:start position:0%
list
 
01:55:27.229 --> 01:55:27.239 align:start position:0%
s um the other list was the gal role the
 
01:55:28.850 --> 01:55:28.860 align:start position:0%
neutral case evaluation expense
 
01:55:28.860 --> 01:55:30.830 align:start position:0%
neutral case evaluation expense
expansion

01:55:30.830 --> 01:55:30.840 align:start position:0%
expansion
 
01:55:33.530 --> 01:55:33.540 align:start position:0%
um Family Law training slash education
 
01:55:35.810 --> 01:55:35.820 align:start position:0%
slash you know continuing education for
 
01:55:37.729 --> 01:55:37.739 align:start position:0%
for judges
 
01:55:42.109 --> 01:55:42.119 align:start position:0%
um the presumption of the equal custody
 
01:55:44.750 --> 01:55:44.760 align:start position:0%
child support guidelines
 
01:55:48.050 --> 01:55:48.060 align:start position:0%
timelines for cases and visitation for
 
01:55:50.149 --> 01:55:50.159 align:start position:0%
at-risk kids
 
01:55:52.850 --> 01:55:52.860 align:start position:0%
so several of those excuse me several of
 
01:55:54.530 --> 01:55:54.540 align:start position:0%
those are things like the gal World
 
01:55:56.450 --> 01:55:56.460 align:start position:0%
expansion events those are really I
 
01:55:58.010 --> 01:55:58.020 align:start position:0%
would put those on things that we could
 
01:55:59.390 --> 01:55:59.400 align:start position:0%
talk about because they have to do with
 
01:56:00.830 --> 01:56:00.840 align:start position:0%
staff and
 
01:56:00.840 --> 01:56:02.090 align:start position:0%
staff and
um

01:56:02.090 --> 01:56:02.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:56:06.050 --> 01:56:06.060 align:start position:0%
the um and also the role of the GAO
 
01:56:06.060 --> 01:56:07.850 align:start position:0%
the um and also the role of the GAO
I

01:56:07.850 --> 01:56:07.860 align:start position:0%
I
 
01:56:10.910 --> 01:56:10.920 align:start position:0%
anyway I went to a case it doesn't their
 
01:56:12.770 --> 01:56:12.780 align:start position:0%
parents that really need Guardian items
 
01:56:14.030 --> 01:56:14.040 align:start position:0%
that are not getting them because they
 
01:56:17.510 --> 01:56:17.520 align:start position:0%
can't afford them and children that are
 
01:56:20.689 --> 01:56:20.699 align:start position:0%
in insecure and in stable places because
 
01:56:24.109 --> 01:56:24.119 align:start position:0%
of that and I think that judges don't
 
01:56:26.149 --> 01:56:26.159 align:start position:0%
have you know by seeing people I mean
 
01:56:28.729 --> 01:56:28.739 align:start position:0%
they really do would benefit from that
 
01:56:28.739 --> 01:56:29.390 align:start position:0%
they really do would benefit from that
um

01:56:29.390 --> 01:56:29.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:56:32.930 --> 01:56:32.940 align:start position:0%
outside of Court you know view so I mean
 
01:56:34.490 --> 01:56:34.500 align:start position:0%
that's something but again so but things
 
01:56:35.990 --> 01:56:36.000 align:start position:0%
like child support guidelines I mean we
 
01:56:37.310 --> 01:56:37.320 align:start position:0%
probably need to narrow that more if
 
01:56:39.109 --> 01:56:39.119 align:start position:0%
we're talking about legislative but that
 
01:56:41.570 --> 01:56:41.580 align:start position:0%
that is a big big thing they are big and
 
01:56:43.250 --> 01:56:43.260 align:start position:0%
I was looking to see like if we want to
 
01:56:44.870 --> 01:56:44.880 align:start position:0%
take on like some people that want to
 
01:56:46.729 --> 01:56:46.739 align:start position:0%
talk about some people that want to take
 
01:56:48.590 --> 01:56:48.600 align:start position:0%
these on so we can kind of out of our
 
01:56:50.570 --> 01:56:50.580 align:start position:0%
subcommittee like who wants to take on
 
01:56:53.629 --> 01:56:53.639 align:start position:0%
which piece and I think you know the gal
 
01:56:55.850 --> 01:56:55.860 align:start position:0%
piece certainly can be legislative
 
01:56:57.530 --> 01:56:57.540 align:start position:0%
because we did just have legislation
 
01:56:59.390 --> 01:56:59.400 align:start position:0%
that had passed through our committee it
 
01:57:01.070 --> 01:57:01.080 align:start position:0%
was a Senate bill but that was giving
 
01:57:02.950 --> 01:57:02.960 align:start position:0%
the the um
 
01:57:02.960 --> 01:57:04.490 align:start position:0%
the the um
Indigent

01:57:04.490 --> 01:57:04.500 align:start position:0%
Indigent
 
01:57:06.950 --> 01:57:06.960 align:start position:0%
um folks access to mediation services
 
01:57:09.229 --> 01:57:09.239 align:start position:0%
without having to repay them so that can
 
01:57:10.609 --> 01:57:10.619 align:start position:0%
certainly be something that's added
 
01:57:14.570 --> 01:57:14.580 align:start position:0%
legislatively legislatively gal wise
 
01:57:17.089 --> 01:57:17.099 align:start position:0%
that those that that could be paid
 
01:57:18.649 --> 01:57:18.659 align:start position:0%
um and that could could be something
 
01:57:21.229 --> 01:57:21.239 align:start position:0%
that's in statute that that is paid so I
 
01:57:22.490 --> 01:57:22.500 align:start position:0%
do think that that
 
01:57:24.229 --> 01:57:24.239 align:start position:0%
are you saying that that doesn't belong
 
01:57:26.209 --> 01:57:26.219 align:start position:0%
on the legislative side I was saying
 
01:57:28.010 --> 01:57:28.020 align:start position:0%
that's a big issue but I can see when we
 
01:57:29.570 --> 01:57:29.580 align:start position:0%
break it down underneath there are other
 
01:57:32.270 --> 01:57:32.280 align:start position:0%
there there are issues that I think the
 
01:57:35.270 --> 01:57:35.280 align:start position:0%
legislature is the appropriate okay but
 
01:57:37.250 --> 01:57:37.260 align:start position:0%
but yeah so do we want to go through the
 
01:57:39.050 --> 01:57:39.060 align:start position:0%
list since people say like which one
 
01:57:42.109 --> 01:57:42.119 align:start position:0%
they want to be um okay g-a-l
 
01:57:44.350 --> 01:57:44.360 align:start position:0%
who would like to
 
01:57:48.589 --> 01:57:48.599 align:start position:0%
not surprisingly representative Greg and
 
01:57:51.530 --> 01:57:51.540 align:start position:0%
representative long
 
01:57:54.709 --> 01:57:54.719 align:start position:0%
um have indicated that they really want
 
01:57:54.719 --> 01:57:55.370 align:start position:0%
um have indicated that they really want
to

01:57:55.370 --> 01:57:55.380 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:57:58.430 --> 01:57:58.440 align:start position:0%
look in all aspects
 
01:58:00.709 --> 01:58:00.719 align:start position:0%
of gal
 
01:58:05.149 --> 01:58:05.159 align:start position:0%
um and here we have to remember that the
 
01:58:07.629 --> 01:58:07.639 align:start position:0%
reason it's on the legislative side
 
01:58:11.870 --> 01:58:11.880 align:start position:0%
isn't just policy
 
01:58:14.589 --> 01:58:14.599 align:start position:0%
um it's dollars
 
01:58:20.089 --> 01:58:20.099 align:start position:0%
and we had for many years paid for this
 
01:58:24.410 --> 01:58:24.420 align:start position:0%
and when we stopped paying for it we
 
01:58:27.470 --> 01:58:27.480 align:start position:0%
um if you think of this as a seesaw
 
01:58:29.930 --> 01:58:29.940 align:start position:0%
um one person on the end of the Seesaw
 
01:58:31.970 --> 01:58:31.980 align:start position:0%
fell off
 
01:58:34.790 --> 01:58:34.800 align:start position:0%
um and so it very definitely is a
 
01:58:34.800 --> 01:58:36.129 align:start position:0%
um and so it very definitely is a
legislative

01:58:36.129 --> 01:58:36.139 align:start position:0%
legislative
 
01:58:42.890 --> 01:58:42.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:46.490 --> 01:58:46.500 align:start position:0%
hey it probably comes down to some
 
01:58:49.250 --> 01:58:49.260 align:start position:0%
different problems including people who
 
01:58:51.770 --> 01:58:51.780 align:start position:0%
would who would carry it out
 
01:58:54.290 --> 01:58:54.300 align:start position:0%
but I could see it as a legislative
 
01:58:56.930 --> 01:58:56.940 align:start position:0%
issue if we were
 
01:58:59.870 --> 01:58:59.880 align:start position:0%
to um in some ways
 
01:59:02.450 --> 01:59:02.460 align:start position:0%
without violating
 
01:59:04.970 --> 01:59:04.980 align:start position:0%
the separation of powers recognize the
 
01:59:07.129 --> 01:59:07.139 align:start position:0%
important role that it could play
 
01:59:09.290 --> 01:59:09.300 align:start position:0%
is this something that anybody would
 
01:59:13.129 --> 01:59:13.139 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:16.490 --> 01:59:16.500 align:start position:0%
and of course all of us can pursue all
 
01:59:18.229 --> 01:59:18.239 align:start position:0%
of these in anything else because we'll
 
01:59:20.689 --> 01:59:20.699 align:start position:0%
come together in the fall and compare
 
01:59:22.490 --> 01:59:22.500 align:start position:0%
notes and see where we are and what we
 
01:59:23.930 --> 01:59:23.940 align:start position:0%
want to do and where we're going to go
 
01:59:26.149 --> 01:59:26.159 align:start position:0%
so none of this is restrictive in any
 
01:59:28.490 --> 01:59:28.500 align:start position:0%
way so yeah I think I'd like to reserve
 
01:59:30.050 --> 01:59:30.060 align:start position:0%
and think about it and tell you what I
 
01:59:31.609 --> 01:59:31.619 align:start position:0%
specifically like
 
01:59:35.390 --> 01:59:35.400 align:start position:0%
when I when we get to the training
 
01:59:35.400 --> 01:59:38.209 align:start position:0%
when I when we get to the training
I

01:59:38.209 --> 01:59:38.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:41.030 --> 01:59:41.040 align:start position:0%
I wonder why you put that on the
 
01:59:44.510 --> 01:59:44.520 align:start position:0%
legislative side rather than on the
 
01:59:47.209 --> 01:59:47.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:49.550 --> 01:59:49.560 align:start position:0%
so I need to think I need to look back
 
01:59:51.770 --> 01:59:51.780 align:start position:0%
but I and and see if it's on the oplc
 
01:59:54.050 --> 01:59:54.060 align:start position:0%
side or if it is legislative but I do
 
01:59:56.089 --> 01:59:56.099 align:start position:0%
know like for for doctors they have a
 
01:59:57.530 --> 01:59:57.540 align:start position:0%
requirement for continuing medical
 
01:59:59.450 --> 01:59:59.460 align:start position:0%
education and they can't re-get their
 
02:00:01.070 --> 02:00:01.080 align:start position:0%
certification unless they've done that
 
02:00:02.570 --> 02:00:02.580 align:start position:0%
so I would think that there it could be
 
02:00:04.490 --> 02:00:04.500 align:start position:0%
a same thing for judges where they have
 
02:00:07.550 --> 02:00:07.560 align:start position:0%
a continuing law training but I do need
 
02:00:10.970 --> 02:00:10.980 align:start position:0%
to see something so because
 
02:00:12.649 --> 02:00:12.659 align:start position:0%
um we're looking at the three branches
 
02:00:14.330 --> 02:00:14.340 align:start position:0%
of government we're looking at the
 
02:00:16.129 --> 02:00:16.139 align:start position:0%
judicial branch it's a different branch
 
02:00:19.850 --> 02:00:19.860 align:start position:0%
the legislature does not play a role in
 
02:00:24.169 --> 02:00:24.179 align:start position:0%
determining who is going to be appointed
 
02:00:27.770 --> 02:00:27.780 align:start position:0%
to the courts and
 
02:00:29.570 --> 02:00:29.580 align:start position:0%
um it is
 
02:00:32.750 --> 02:00:32.760 align:start position:0%
um the judicial Council and other
 
02:00:35.149 --> 02:00:35.159 align:start position:0%
institutions I would think that are
 
02:00:38.149 --> 02:00:38.159 align:start position:0%
responsible for the training for
 
02:00:41.930 --> 02:00:41.940 align:start position:0%
education and certainly for supervision
 
02:00:44.750 --> 02:00:44.760 align:start position:0%
and accountability
 
02:00:49.370 --> 02:00:49.380 align:start position:0%
um we do know in cases where judges
 
02:00:49.380 --> 02:00:50.209 align:start position:0%
um we do know in cases where judges
um

02:00:50.209 --> 02:00:50.219 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:00:52.850 --> 02:00:52.860 align:start position:0%
who have behaved inappropriately have
 
02:00:54.550 --> 02:00:54.560 align:start position:0%
been removed
 
02:01:00.109 --> 02:01:00.119 align:start position:0%
they were removed because it was someone
 
02:01:04.010 --> 02:01:04.020 align:start position:0%
in the judicial branch who uh brought
 
02:01:06.410 --> 02:01:06.420 align:start position:0%
forward a complaint That Was Then heard
 
02:01:07.970 --> 02:01:07.980 align:start position:0%
by the judicial conduct committee
 
02:01:11.629 --> 02:01:11.639 align:start position:0%
enacted on on whatever so I guess
 
02:01:14.750 --> 02:01:14.760 align:start position:0%
I'd have to be convinced that that
 
02:01:17.510 --> 02:01:17.520 align:start position:0%
belongs on the legislative side and if
 
02:01:19.729 --> 02:01:19.739 align:start position:0%
somebody disagrees with me I would I
 
02:01:21.410 --> 02:01:21.420 align:start position:0%
would welcome the disagreement because
 
02:01:24.290 --> 02:01:24.300 align:start position:0%
these are all so complicated I moved it
 
02:01:25.490 --> 02:01:25.500 align:start position:0%
over I agree with you after you've
 
02:01:30.109 --> 02:01:30.119 align:start position:0%
spoken thank you so representative this
 
02:01:31.910 --> 02:01:31.920 align:start position:0%
is on the training you moved it back to
 
02:01:35.870 --> 02:01:35.880 align:start position:0%
the uh the import side so with respect
 
02:01:39.370 --> 02:01:39.380 align:start position:0%
to uh attorneys having to get
 
02:01:41.570 --> 02:01:41.580 align:start position:0%
attorneys are not licensed by the
 
02:01:42.709 --> 02:01:42.719 align:start position:0%
government by the state government
 
02:01:46.129 --> 02:01:46.139 align:start position:0%
they're licensed and disciplined and
 
02:01:48.169 --> 02:01:48.179 align:start position:0%
their education requirements are the New
 
02:01:50.209 --> 02:01:50.219 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Bar Association okay so that's
 
02:01:52.729 --> 02:01:52.739 align:start position:0%
that's not okay then like Physicians and
 
02:01:54.229 --> 02:01:54.239 align:start position:0%
nurses I mean they might be the medical
 
02:01:56.450 --> 02:01:56.460 align:start position:0%
association and they do and the Bar
 
02:01:56.460 --> 02:01:59.149 align:start position:0%
association and they do and the Bar
Association

02:01:59.149 --> 02:01:59.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:03.169 --> 02:02:03.179 align:start position:0%
I think part of the judicial branch it
 
02:02:05.810 --> 02:02:05.820 align:start position:0%
is not an independent body as it is in
 
02:02:08.390 --> 02:02:08.400 align:start position:0%
some states so so legislator would only
 
02:02:10.370 --> 02:02:10.380 align:start position:0%
have say in whether we were going to
 
02:02:12.290 --> 02:02:12.300 align:start position:0%
elect our judges or nominate an
 
02:02:14.689 --> 02:02:14.699 align:start position:0%
appointee right however
 
02:02:17.810 --> 02:02:17.820 align:start position:0%
their qualifications is not in our hands
 
02:02:21.050 --> 02:02:21.060 align:start position:0%
and and that's right and okay
 
02:02:21.060 --> 02:02:21.770 align:start position:0%
and and that's right and okay
um

02:02:21.770 --> 02:02:21.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:02:24.890 --> 02:02:24.900 align:start position:0%
uh I don't think there's anybody on the
 
02:02:27.050 --> 02:02:27.060 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court now who has ever had any
 
02:02:29.629 --> 02:02:29.639 align:start position:0%
experience in family core there are some
 
02:02:31.729 --> 02:02:31.739 align:start position:0%
people on the Supreme Court who haven't
 
02:02:35.270 --> 02:02:35.280 align:start position:0%
had any experience in court
 
02:02:39.169 --> 02:02:39.179 align:start position:0%
um there are and in Family Court
 
02:02:40.850 --> 02:02:40.860 align:start position:0%
judge Marconi had
 
02:02:45.109 --> 02:02:45.119 align:start position:0%
fall experience baby baby
 
02:02:45.119 --> 02:02:48.050 align:start position:0%
fall experience baby baby
um

02:02:48.050 --> 02:02:48.060 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:50.870 --> 02:02:50.880 align:start position:0%
training is on the judicial I would I
 
02:02:54.490 --> 02:02:54.500 align:start position:0%
would say and and accountability
 
02:02:59.689 --> 02:02:59.699 align:start position:0%
I mean unless I mean unless the
 
02:03:02.510 --> 02:03:02.520 align:start position:0%
legislature were to move
 
02:03:02.520 --> 02:03:04.209 align:start position:0%
legislature were to move
to

02:03:04.209 --> 02:03:04.219 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:03:08.750 --> 02:03:08.760 align:start position:0%
impeach to charge a judge in the the
 
02:03:11.330 --> 02:03:11.340 align:start position:0%
house would do and then the Senate to
 
02:03:13.669 --> 02:03:13.679 align:start position:0%
try the judge
 
02:03:15.649 --> 02:03:15.659 align:start position:0%
um the legislature would have no
 
02:03:17.870 --> 02:03:17.880 align:start position:0%
involvement it's the Constitution gives
 
02:03:21.050 --> 02:03:21.060 align:start position:0%
us that responsibility and in my 25
 
02:03:24.410 --> 02:03:24.420 align:start position:0%
years that basically happened once
 
02:03:24.420 --> 02:03:25.370 align:start position:0%
years that basically happened once
um

02:03:25.370 --> 02:03:25.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:03:25.380 --> 02:03:27.729 align:start position:0%
um
uh

02:03:27.729 --> 02:03:27.739 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:03:32.510 --> 02:03:32.520 align:start position:0%
and uh so in terms of removal of of a
 
02:03:35.870 --> 02:03:35.880 align:start position:0%
judge uh generally the judges are who
 
02:03:37.189 --> 02:03:37.199 align:start position:0%
are removed have been removed through
 
02:03:39.470 --> 02:03:39.480 align:start position:0%
the judicial conduct committee
 
02:03:42.290 --> 02:03:42.300 align:start position:0%
I I may just be being defensive for the
 
02:03:44.089 --> 02:03:44.099 align:start position:0%
profession but I I can't remember which
 
02:03:46.129 --> 02:03:46.139 align:start position:0%
Governor it was I believe it was 15 or
 
02:03:48.950 --> 02:03:48.960 align:start position:0%
20 years ago I but whatever government
 
02:03:51.050 --> 02:03:51.060 align:start position:0%
was did give up considerable political
 
02:03:53.390 --> 02:03:53.400 align:start position:0%
power when there was established it was
 
02:03:55.729 --> 02:03:55.739 align:start position:0%
a judge
 
02:03:58.790 --> 02:03:58.800 align:start position:0%
screening process nomination process low
 
02:04:00.290 --> 02:04:00.300 align:start position:0%
level and goes through different
 
02:04:02.089 --> 02:04:02.099 align:start position:0%
committees and then those
 
02:04:04.189 --> 02:04:04.199 align:start position:0%
recommendations are brought forward to
 
02:04:06.649 --> 02:04:06.659 align:start position:0%
the executive Council so I'm not saying
 
02:04:08.870 --> 02:04:08.880 align:start position:0%
that politics politics is plays a part
 
02:04:11.089 --> 02:04:11.099 align:start position:0%
in everything
 
02:04:14.470 --> 02:04:14.480 align:start position:0%
um but I I I think that there has been a
 
02:04:17.570 --> 02:04:17.580 align:start position:0%
more recent a contemporary change to
 
02:04:20.030 --> 02:04:20.040 align:start position:0%
limit the way politics plays and how and
 
02:04:21.709 --> 02:04:21.719 align:start position:0%
how or maybe how many people can play
 
02:04:25.010 --> 02:04:25.020 align:start position:0%
into it but um I I I don't we should
 
02:04:26.689 --> 02:04:26.699 align:start position:0%
educate ourselves on that we should stay
 
02:04:28.490 --> 02:04:28.500 align:start position:0%
away from it but
 
02:04:31.970 --> 02:04:31.980 align:start position:0%
um I don't feel like politics is is a
 
02:04:34.450 --> 02:04:34.460 align:start position:0%
significant factor in
 
02:04:37.070 --> 02:04:37.080 align:start position:0%
dissatification the dissatification with
 
02:04:38.689 --> 02:04:38.699 align:start position:0%
judges that we've or the judicial
 
02:04:39.950 --> 02:04:39.960 align:start position:0%
decisions that we've been hearing from
 
02:04:41.750 --> 02:04:41.760 align:start position:0%
thank you representative I haven't heard
 
02:04:44.030 --> 02:04:44.040 align:start position:0%
anybody suggest that it was politics I
 
02:04:46.250 --> 02:04:46.260 align:start position:0%
will point out that you're absolutely
 
02:04:49.270 --> 02:04:49.280 align:start position:0%
right that there was a governor who
 
02:04:52.970 --> 02:04:52.980 align:start position:0%
insisted that um we use a system more
 
02:04:54.950 --> 02:04:54.960 align:start position:0%
parallel to what the federal government
 
02:04:58.430 --> 02:04:58.440 align:start position:0%
does in having a screening process but
 
02:05:01.370 --> 02:05:01.380 align:start position:0%
um the the incumbent Governor has
 
02:05:05.089 --> 02:05:05.099 align:start position:0%
changed that and is does not rely on
 
02:05:07.250 --> 02:05:07.260 align:start position:0%
an independent
 
02:05:10.970 --> 02:05:10.980 align:start position:0%
um advisory body for nominations it's a
 
02:05:14.270 --> 02:05:14.280 align:start position:0%
different system uh so um that you know
 
02:05:15.770 --> 02:05:15.780 align:start position:0%
that does change
 
02:05:17.629 --> 02:05:17.639 align:start position:0%
um which is not to say that it's
 
02:05:19.490 --> 02:05:19.500 align:start position:0%
partisan political
 
02:05:20.930 --> 02:05:20.940 align:start position:0%
um it's just to say that it's a
 
02:05:22.850 --> 02:05:22.860 align:start position:0%
different system
 
02:05:25.310 --> 02:05:25.320 align:start position:0%
um okay next
 
02:05:28.189 --> 02:05:28.199 align:start position:0%
what what are we up to on your list
 
02:05:30.770 --> 02:05:30.780 align:start position:0%
um the equal slash shared cost
 
02:05:34.490 --> 02:05:34.500 align:start position:0%
equal shared custody okay now here's my
 
02:05:36.770 --> 02:05:36.780 align:start position:0%
question what there is a retained bill
 
02:05:38.689 --> 02:05:38.699 align:start position:0%
on that I know in the family law
 
02:05:40.189 --> 02:05:40.199 align:start position:0%
committee so I'm not sure if there's
 
02:05:46.609 --> 02:05:46.619 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:48.550 --> 02:05:48.560 align:start position:0%
with the subcommittee so I would put it
 
02:05:52.970 --> 02:05:52.980 align:start position:0%
so well so the the Shared Parenting the
 
02:05:54.709 --> 02:05:54.719 align:start position:0%
Shared Parenting
 
02:05:54.719 --> 02:05:57.229 align:start position:0%
Shared Parenting
um

02:05:57.229 --> 02:05:57.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:59.270 --> 02:05:59.280 align:start position:0%
is a policy of the children and family
 
02:06:00.709 --> 02:06:00.719 align:start position:0%
would go to the children family law
 
02:06:02.450 --> 02:06:02.460 align:start position:0%
committee so that shouldn't be
 
02:06:07.010 --> 02:06:07.020 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:09.589 --> 02:06:09.599 align:start position:0%
actually they have uh we were just
 
02:06:15.350 --> 02:06:15.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:17.149 --> 02:06:17.159 align:start position:0%
um I don't even see it now now I'm
 
02:06:17.159 --> 02:06:18.109 align:start position:0%
um I don't even see it now now I'm
looking

02:06:18.109 --> 02:06:18.119 align:start position:0%
looking
 
02:06:22.129 --> 02:06:22.139 align:start position:0%
but I know it's Pearson ball is that the
 
02:06:24.470 --> 02:06:24.480 align:start position:0%
one we're all in
 
02:06:27.109 --> 02:06:27.119 align:start position:0%
we're talking about
 
02:06:28.910 --> 02:06:28.920 align:start position:0%
survive Senate ball who's who's working
 
02:06:30.290 --> 02:06:30.300 align:start position:0%
on that with you
 
02:06:30.300 --> 02:06:38.390 align:start position:0%
on that with you
actually

02:06:38.390 --> 02:06:38.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:38.400 --> 02:06:39.950 align:start position:0%
 
oh

02:06:39.950 --> 02:06:39.960 align:start position:0%
oh
 
02:06:48.709 --> 02:06:48.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:53.030 --> 02:06:53.040 align:start position:0%
okay so the Shared Parenting is Pearson
 
02:06:53.040 --> 02:06:55.070 align:start position:0%
okay so the Shared Parenting is Pearson
ball

02:06:55.070 --> 02:06:55.080 align:start position:0%
ball
 
02:06:55.080 --> 02:06:56.870 align:start position:0%
ball
Greg

02:06:56.870 --> 02:06:56.880 align:start position:0%
Greg
 
02:06:56.880 --> 02:06:58.490 align:start position:0%
Greg
long

02:06:58.490 --> 02:06:58.500 align:start position:0%
long
 
02:07:01.070 --> 02:07:01.080 align:start position:0%
and McMahon
 
02:07:01.080 --> 02:07:02.629 align:start position:0%
and McMahon
okay

02:07:02.629 --> 02:07:02.639 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:07:05.270 --> 02:07:05.280 align:start position:0%
one two three okay so that's sheer
 
02:07:06.709 --> 02:07:06.719 align:start position:0%
parenting and so that I think that
 
02:07:08.510 --> 02:07:08.520 align:start position:0%
that's handled by children and family
 
02:07:12.050 --> 02:07:12.060 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:14.270 --> 02:07:14.280 align:start position:0%
I believe that that's House Bill 185
 
02:07:17.030 --> 02:07:17.040 align:start position:0%
yeah so you have long Moulton Levesque
 
02:07:21.530 --> 02:07:21.540 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:24.109 --> 02:07:24.119 align:start position:0%
okay next
 
02:07:26.450 --> 02:07:26.460 align:start position:0%
um so I would move shared parenting if
 
02:07:28.910 --> 02:07:28.920 align:start position:0%
if everybody agrees that that belongs
 
02:07:31.490 --> 02:07:31.500 align:start position:0%
with Children and Family
 
02:07:34.250 --> 02:07:34.260 align:start position:0%
given the existing bill
 
02:07:37.370 --> 02:07:37.380 align:start position:0%
yes everybody talked about that anybody
 
02:07:39.709 --> 02:07:39.719 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable with that so I guess I
 
02:07:41.149 --> 02:07:41.159 align:start position:0%
would say I think they kind of overlap
 
02:07:42.770 --> 02:07:42.780 align:start position:0%
because I do think it still belongs here
 
02:07:44.629 --> 02:07:44.639 align:start position:0%
and I know other special committees have
 
02:07:46.729 --> 02:07:46.739 align:start position:0%
then take kind of taken over a bill and
 
02:07:47.990 --> 02:07:48.000 align:start position:0%
I'm fine with that bill staying in there
 
02:07:49.370 --> 02:07:49.380 align:start position:0%
I just think we should keep a watch on
 
02:07:50.390 --> 02:07:50.400 align:start position:0%
it because I do think it's very
 
02:07:51.649 --> 02:07:51.659 align:start position:0%
important to what we're doing so I think
 
02:07:52.970 --> 02:07:52.980 align:start position:0%
I'm okay with them doing it but I think
 
02:07:54.950 --> 02:07:54.960 align:start position:0%
we should just I think that's a very
 
02:07:57.410 --> 02:07:57.420 align:start position:0%
good point and I think in in our
 
02:07:59.750 --> 02:07:59.760 align:start position:0%
summations we should identify this as an
 
02:08:02.629 --> 02:08:02.639 align:start position:0%
important area that is being pursued by
 
02:08:04.430 --> 02:08:04.440 align:start position:0%
children and family law does that make
 
02:08:06.890 --> 02:08:06.900 align:start position:0%
sense to you I was thinking that the
 
02:08:09.350 --> 02:08:09.360 align:start position:0%
children and family law members of this
 
02:08:12.470 --> 02:08:12.480 align:start position:0%
committee would be right seeing that
 
02:08:15.709 --> 02:08:15.719 align:start position:0%
just okay judicial may have other things
 
02:08:15.719 --> 02:08:18.350 align:start position:0%
just okay judicial may have other things
okay

02:08:18.350 --> 02:08:18.360 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:08:21.290 --> 02:08:21.300 align:start position:0%
um next so regarding the rules I did
 
02:08:24.350 --> 02:08:24.360 align:start position:0%
actually just pull up RSA 49f colon six
 
02:08:27.109 --> 02:08:27.119 align:start position:0%
and it does actually have in here that
 
02:08:29.089 --> 02:08:29.099 align:start position:0%
judges assigned to the family court
 
02:08:31.010 --> 02:08:31.020 align:start position:0%
shall be subject to the following
 
02:08:32.689 --> 02:08:32.699 align:start position:0%
considerations the knowledge commitment
 
02:08:34.490 --> 02:08:34.500 align:start position:0%
to an expertise of the judge in the
 
02:08:35.810 --> 02:08:35.820 align:start position:0%
subject matter of the particular
 
02:08:37.729 --> 02:08:37.739 align:start position:0%
division which the judge is assigned so
 
02:08:40.910 --> 02:08:40.920 align:start position:0%
there are actually there is legislative
 
02:08:43.070 --> 02:08:43.080 align:start position:0%
statute about requirements for judges so
 
02:08:45.830 --> 02:08:45.840 align:start position:0%
I don't think that having the training
 
02:08:49.189 --> 02:08:49.199 align:start position:0%
for the judges is completely out of the
 
02:08:54.410 --> 02:08:54.420 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:57.709 --> 02:08:57.719 align:start position:0%
okay let's see what happens as long as
 
02:08:59.890 --> 02:08:59.900 align:start position:0%
you have a what is the RSA
 
02:09:05.209 --> 02:09:05.219 align:start position:0%
490 Dash F colon six F yeah f is in
 
02:09:07.129 --> 02:09:07.139 align:start position:0%
Frank okay
 
02:09:08.810 --> 02:09:08.820 align:start position:0%
um so we can we can look into that after
 
02:09:10.250 --> 02:09:10.260 align:start position:0%
I'll go to I can go on to the next one
 
02:09:11.870 --> 02:09:11.880 align:start position:0%
so the next one was child support which
 
02:09:12.950 --> 02:09:12.960 align:start position:0%
I think is going to be the same
 
02:09:14.510 --> 02:09:14.520 align:start position:0%
situation where we'll watch that bill
 
02:09:16.729 --> 02:09:16.739 align:start position:0%
because there is a bill in the Family
 
02:09:19.669 --> 02:09:19.679 align:start position:0%
Court committee that they retained right
 
02:09:21.470 --> 02:09:21.480 align:start position:0%
children family you have a child support
 
02:09:21.480 --> 02:09:25.189 align:start position:0%
children family you have a child support
bill

02:09:25.189 --> 02:09:25.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:27.770 --> 02:09:27.780 align:start position:0%
what we did
 
02:09:30.229 --> 02:09:30.239 align:start position:0%
okay so then maybe we should maybe we
 
02:09:31.669 --> 02:09:31.679 align:start position:0%
should look into that separately then
 
02:09:33.410 --> 02:09:33.420 align:start position:0%
instead of the wage guard let's let's do
 
02:09:34.790 --> 02:09:34.800 align:start position:0%
that separately
 
02:09:37.189 --> 02:09:37.199 align:start position:0%
so wage garnishment would be the
 
02:09:39.649 --> 02:09:39.659 align:start position:0%
children and family law but I think we
 
02:09:40.850 --> 02:09:40.860 align:start position:0%
should look separately into the area
 
02:09:42.109 --> 02:09:42.119 align:start position:0%
because I think it's much wider than
 
02:09:44.990 --> 02:09:45.000 align:start position:0%
just that that would be House Bill 618.
 
02:09:48.250 --> 02:09:48.260 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I didn't hear House Bill 618
 
02:09:50.510 --> 02:09:50.520 align:start position:0%
thank you garnishment so I think we
 
02:09:52.010 --> 02:09:52.020 align:start position:0%
might need an additional bill in
 
02:09:57.530 --> 02:09:57.540 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:00.229 --> 02:10:00.239 align:start position:0%
um timelines for cases
 
02:10:03.290 --> 02:10:03.300 align:start position:0%
okay and we do have statue on some
 
02:10:05.089 --> 02:10:05.099 align:start position:0%
timelines and then there's some that do
 
02:10:07.010 --> 02:10:07.020 align:start position:0%
not have any statue associated with it
 
02:10:08.330 --> 02:10:08.340 align:start position:0%
so I think that that's overall something
 
02:10:10.010 --> 02:10:10.020 align:start position:0%
that we can look at what does currently
 
02:10:11.870 --> 02:10:11.880 align:start position:0%
have statue and then
 
02:10:14.270 --> 02:10:14.280 align:start position:0%
maybe what needs to have statues so that
 
02:10:16.070 --> 02:10:16.080 align:start position:0%
we're making sure that
 
02:10:18.589 --> 02:10:18.599 align:start position:0%
you know these cases are resolved within
 
02:10:19.550 --> 02:10:19.560 align:start position:0%
a certain amount of time or at least
 
02:10:21.350 --> 02:10:21.360 align:start position:0%
that there's a within a certain amount
 
02:10:24.169 --> 02:10:24.179 align:start position:0%
of time that there's a uh parenting plan
 
02:10:25.970 --> 02:10:25.980 align:start position:0%
established that that's making sure that
 
02:10:30.950 --> 02:10:30.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:30.960 --> 02:10:31.850 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:10:31.850 --> 02:10:31.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:10:31.860 --> 02:10:34.669 align:start position:0%
um
well

02:10:34.669 --> 02:10:34.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:36.950 --> 02:10:36.960 align:start position:0%
I don't know I mean
 
02:10:38.270 --> 02:10:38.280 align:start position:0%
I think at the moment it's this
 
02:10:39.950 --> 02:10:39.960 align:start position:0%
committee and then we can you know
 
02:10:42.290 --> 02:10:42.300 align:start position:0%
there's certainly nothing that I'm aware
 
02:10:43.930 --> 02:10:43.940 align:start position:0%
of that's in the
 
02:10:47.990 --> 02:10:48.000 align:start position:0%
Judiciary Committee that would uh deal
 
02:10:50.450 --> 02:10:50.460 align:start position:0%
with that so I think it's it's it's this
 
02:10:54.229 --> 02:10:54.239 align:start position:0%
committee um I'm one of the things that
 
02:10:56.450 --> 02:10:56.460 align:start position:0%
one of the things that I'm interested in
 
02:11:00.109 --> 02:11:00.119 align:start position:0%
about these timelines issue is
 
02:11:00.119 --> 02:11:04.250 align:start position:0%
about these timelines issue is
um

02:11:04.250 --> 02:11:04.260 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:10.070 --> 02:11:10.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:14.109 --> 02:11:14.119 align:start position:0%
the process within the judicial branch
 
02:11:17.689 --> 02:11:17.699 align:start position:0%
where individuals
 
02:11:20.629 --> 02:11:20.639 align:start position:0%
file a complaint and then file I'm using
 
02:11:23.209 --> 02:11:23.219 align:start position:0%
the word complaint generically not as a
 
02:11:26.629 --> 02:11:26.639 align:start position:0%
as a legal term and then file a
 
02:11:28.370 --> 02:11:28.380 align:start position:0%
complaint and then file a complaint and
 
02:11:30.830 --> 02:11:30.840 align:start position:0%
then file a complaint and then file a
 
02:11:30.840 --> 02:11:32.149 align:start position:0%
then file a complaint and then file a
complaint

02:11:32.149 --> 02:11:32.159 align:start position:0%
complaint
 
02:11:36.550 --> 02:11:36.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:39.890 --> 02:11:39.900 align:start position:0%
you do not want to limit the number of
 
02:11:41.750 --> 02:11:41.760 align:start position:0%
complaints that someone could file if
 
02:11:43.070 --> 02:11:43.080 align:start position:0%
there's a legitimate reason for somebody
 
02:11:45.890 --> 02:11:45.900 align:start position:0%
to complain but
 
02:11:48.830 --> 02:11:48.840 align:start position:0%
what then happens with the timelines
 
02:11:48.840 --> 02:11:51.229 align:start position:0%
what then happens with the timelines
and

02:11:51.229 --> 02:11:51.239 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:11:53.629 --> 02:11:53.639 align:start position:0%
and how does that get handled and Who
 
02:11:54.589 --> 02:11:54.599 align:start position:0%
was Ruth
 
02:11:58.250 --> 02:11:58.260 align:start position:0%
responsible then for what is
 
02:12:00.530 --> 02:12:00.540 align:start position:0%
what could be
 
02:12:00.540 --> 02:12:01.669 align:start position:0%
what could be
um

02:12:01.669 --> 02:12:01.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:12:04.070 --> 02:12:04.080 align:start position:0%
would someone in a bad mood in the
 
02:12:10.070 --> 02:12:10.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:14.629 --> 02:12:14.639 align:start position:0%
the issue is what we heard is the um the
 
02:12:17.390 --> 02:12:17.400 align:start position:0%
docket it's very complicating in the
 
02:12:20.390 --> 02:12:20.400 align:start position:0%
dockets set up so every time there's for
 
02:12:23.930 --> 02:12:23.940 align:start position:0%
example we went to a case where that had
 
02:12:26.030 --> 02:12:26.040 align:start position:0%
the attorney that the other that again
 
02:12:28.790 --> 02:12:28.800 align:start position:0%
didn't show up so there was 20 minutes
 
02:12:30.950 --> 02:12:30.960 align:start position:0%
spent there and they had to redo it so
 
02:12:32.149 --> 02:12:32.159 align:start position:0%
there's another
 
02:12:33.410 --> 02:12:33.420 align:start position:0%
you know they're looking for another
 
02:12:37.250 --> 02:12:37.260 align:start position:0%
spot on another docket and setting a
 
02:12:40.430 --> 02:12:40.440 align:start position:0%
timeline if those timelines aren't met
 
02:12:40.440 --> 02:12:42.050 align:start position:0%
timeline if those timelines aren't met
it's

02:12:42.050 --> 02:12:42.060 align:start position:0%
it's
 
02:12:45.169 --> 02:12:45.179 align:start position:0%
um it's it's complicated setting up the
 
02:12:47.390 --> 02:12:47.400 align:start position:0%
docket because you
 
02:12:49.370 --> 02:12:49.380 align:start position:0%
um you got the docket set up
 
02:12:51.290 --> 02:12:51.300 align:start position:0%
I don't know a week or two weeks or
 
02:12:54.050 --> 02:12:54.060 align:start position:0%
longer in advance and trying to fit
 
02:12:56.149 --> 02:12:56.159 align:start position:0%
somebody in to meet this timeline would
 
02:12:58.609 --> 02:12:58.619 align:start position:0%
it's what's complicated so I mean I
 
02:13:00.589 --> 02:13:00.599 align:start position:0%
guess at least especially for ensuring
 
02:13:02.270 --> 02:13:02.280 align:start position:0%
that a parenting plan is established
 
02:13:03.770 --> 02:13:03.780 align:start position:0%
within a certain amount of time maybe
 
02:13:06.169 --> 02:13:06.179 align:start position:0%
the whole case isn't closed but I I
 
02:13:07.790 --> 02:13:07.800 align:start position:0%
would like to make sure that within some
 
02:13:09.770 --> 02:13:09.780 align:start position:0%
amount of time we're making sure that
 
02:13:14.050 --> 02:13:14.060 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:14.060 --> 02:13:15.589 align:start position:0%
 
so

02:13:15.589 --> 02:13:15.599 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:13:17.450 --> 02:13:17.460 align:start position:0%
um so I'm agreeing with the conversation
 
02:13:18.830 --> 02:13:18.840 align:start position:0%
one thing that's making me uncomfortable
 
02:13:21.470 --> 02:13:21.480 align:start position:0%
though is we're identified issues and I
 
02:13:23.390 --> 02:13:23.400 align:start position:0%
I don't see these subcommittee groups
 
02:13:26.270 --> 02:13:26.280 align:start position:0%
going off to find the answer I I'm I'm
 
02:13:27.770 --> 02:13:27.780 align:start position:0%
wanting them to bring back more
 
02:13:30.109 --> 02:13:30.119 align:start position:0%
information so that we can then address
 
02:13:32.390 --> 02:13:32.400 align:start position:0%
them you know so we've if we say
 
02:13:34.430 --> 02:13:34.440 align:start position:0%
timelines are an issue I don't know that
 
02:13:36.290 --> 02:13:36.300 align:start position:0%
it's for us to create the timeline it's
 
02:13:38.510 --> 02:13:38.520 align:start position:0%
to really look are they an issue which
 
02:13:38.520 --> 02:13:39.830 align:start position:0%
to really look are they an issue which
cases

02:13:39.830 --> 02:13:39.840 align:start position:0%
cases
 
02:13:41.330 --> 02:13:41.340 align:start position:0%
um you know what's already established
 
02:13:43.129 --> 02:13:43.139 align:start position:0%
why is it what's already established
 
02:13:45.350 --> 02:13:45.360 align:start position:0%
working do we need to do more and bring
 
02:13:46.550 --> 02:13:46.560 align:start position:0%
that back
 
02:13:48.950 --> 02:13:48.960 align:start position:0%
um so I think I think we all agree with
 
02:13:50.990 --> 02:13:51.000 align:start position:0%
it I don't think anybody's going out and
 
02:13:53.030 --> 02:13:53.040 align:start position:0%
out of search for the Holy Grail we're
 
02:13:54.770 --> 02:13:54.780 align:start position:0%
going out to say okay here are areas
 
02:13:56.750 --> 02:13:56.760 align:start position:0%
that we've identified as problems what
 
02:13:58.430 --> 02:13:58.440 align:start position:0%
in fact are the problems how do we
 
02:14:01.370 --> 02:14:01.380 align:start position:0%
Define the problems do we have balanced
 
02:14:04.310 --> 02:14:04.320 align:start position:0%
information that we're collecting
 
02:14:06.950 --> 02:14:06.960 align:start position:0%
um uh so that's I think on the one hand
 
02:14:09.290 --> 02:14:09.300 align:start position:0%
this on the other hand yeah because the
 
02:14:11.870 --> 02:14:11.880 align:start position:0%
timelines we we may have ideal timelines
 
02:14:13.790 --> 02:14:13.800 align:start position:0%
but if we can't get the legislature or
 
02:14:16.129 --> 02:14:16.139 align:start position:0%
if it happens to be Staffing then that's
 
02:14:18.169 --> 02:14:18.179 align:start position:0%
our issue so I I mean so I will work on
 
02:14:19.609 --> 02:14:19.619 align:start position:0%
timelines but again I'm not looking at
 
02:14:21.470 --> 02:14:21.480 align:start position:0%
this as well I think the best I mean I
 
02:14:23.450 --> 02:14:23.460 align:start position:0%
think the best timeline is today well
 
02:14:24.830 --> 02:14:24.840 align:start position:0%
you know I have my clients generally say
 
02:14:26.030 --> 02:14:26.040 align:start position:0%
well why didn't they rule From the Bench
 
02:14:28.430 --> 02:14:28.440 align:start position:0%
why didn't they tell me today so
 
02:14:30.530 --> 02:14:30.540 align:start position:0%
um I mean I just hope that everybody is
 
02:14:32.930 --> 02:14:32.940 align:start position:0%
when we look at shared parenting again
 
02:14:34.850 --> 02:14:34.860 align:start position:0%
and that's an issue that
 
02:14:37.609 --> 02:14:37.619 align:start position:0%
um I I don't I I think both parents
 
02:14:39.770 --> 02:14:39.780 align:start position:0%
should be treated equally but I I want
 
02:14:41.750 --> 02:14:41.760 align:start position:0%
to know why do you want to establish the
 
02:14:43.490 --> 02:14:43.500 align:start position:0%
bar why is it best to establish the bar
 
02:14:45.890 --> 02:14:45.900 align:start position:0%
if you are 50 50 or what does shared
 
02:14:47.990 --> 02:14:48.000 align:start position:0%
parenting mean that that's going to okay
 
02:14:49.810 --> 02:14:49.820 align:start position:0%
so I'm just hoping people come back
 
02:14:52.970 --> 02:14:52.980 align:start position:0%
which has a bill okay all right okay so
 
02:14:56.089 --> 02:14:56.099 align:start position:0%
timely to fall thank you
 
02:14:57.890 --> 02:14:57.900 align:start position:0%
um Madam chairman
 
02:15:00.890 --> 02:15:00.900 align:start position:0%
another bill that we do have is um house
 
02:15:00.900 --> 02:15:01.850 align:start position:0%
another bill that we do have is um house
bill

02:15:01.850 --> 02:15:01.860 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:15:01.860 --> 02:15:03.410 align:start position:0%
bill
uh

02:15:03.410 --> 02:15:03.420 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:15:05.930 --> 02:15:05.940 align:start position:0%
where did I just lose it to
 
02:15:05.940 --> 02:15:06.950 align:start position:0%
where did I just lose it to
um

02:15:06.950 --> 02:15:06.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:15:09.770 --> 02:15:09.780 align:start position:0%
oh I think this is one representative
 
02:15:12.109 --> 02:15:12.119 align:start position:0%
long was referring to House Bill 471
 
02:15:14.270 --> 02:15:14.280 align:start position:0%
which was establishing the final
 
02:15:16.250 --> 02:15:16.260 align:start position:0%
disposition for the divorce case and
 
02:15:18.290 --> 02:15:18.300 align:start position:0%
that goes into the timeline and I think
 
02:15:19.910 --> 02:15:19.920 align:start position:0%
what people what they were coming
 
02:15:22.550 --> 02:15:22.560 align:start position:0%
forward and telling us is that
 
02:15:24.709 --> 02:15:24.719 align:start position:0%
when they went for their temporary
 
02:15:26.450 --> 02:15:26.460 align:start position:0%
hearing they wanted something scheduled
 
02:15:29.089 --> 02:15:29.099 align:start position:0%
a year out and put in the docket so that
 
02:15:30.950 --> 02:15:30.960 align:start position:0%
they would know they were in the queue
 
02:15:33.410 --> 02:15:33.420 align:start position:0%
because what they were saying is they
 
02:15:35.689 --> 02:15:35.699 align:start position:0%
would spend lots of time
 
02:15:35.699 --> 02:15:37.370 align:start position:0%
would spend lots of time
um

02:15:37.370 --> 02:15:37.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:15:38.990 --> 02:15:39.000 align:start position:0%
um negotiating with each other and
 
02:15:40.850 --> 02:15:40.860 align:start position:0%
coming up with an agreement and then
 
02:15:42.589 --> 02:15:42.599 align:start position:0%
when they went to set the time in the
 
02:15:44.149 --> 02:15:44.159 align:start position:0%
court it was like a whole another year
 
02:15:46.609 --> 02:15:46.619 align:start position:0%
away and so that allowed a whole another
 
02:15:48.589 --> 02:15:48.599 align:start position:0%
year for now things to Bubble Up and now
 
02:15:49.729 --> 02:15:49.739 align:start position:0%
people are going to go after each other
 
02:15:51.470 --> 02:15:51.480 align:start position:0%
that was my understanding I could be
 
02:15:53.450 --> 02:15:53.460 align:start position:0%
wrong but that was something that the um
 
02:15:55.850 --> 02:15:55.860 align:start position:0%
children and family law was looking at
 
02:15:57.950 --> 02:15:57.960 align:start position:0%
me thank you
 
02:15:59.990 --> 02:16:00.000 align:start position:0%
okay what else
 
02:16:04.370 --> 02:16:04.380 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:06.050 --> 02:16:06.060 align:start position:0%
um I know that rep blanza had raised out
 
02:16:18.649 --> 02:16:18.659 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:22.550 --> 02:16:22.560 align:start position:0%
um and then the next are the uh
 
02:16:25.129 --> 02:16:25.139 align:start position:0%
potentially the court rules so
 
02:16:25.139 --> 02:16:26.030 align:start position:0%
potentially the court rules so
um

02:16:26.030 --> 02:16:26.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:16:29.810 --> 02:16:29.820 align:start position:0%
looking at staff and ways to help uh Pro
 
02:16:34.669 --> 02:16:34.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:37.969 --> 02:16:37.979 align:start position:0%
I mean prep Greg and rep McBeth
 
02:16:40.070 --> 02:16:40.080 align:start position:0%
who said they wanted
 
02:16:40.080 --> 02:16:44.929 align:start position:0%
who said they wanted
Macbeth

02:16:44.929 --> 02:16:44.939 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:50.629 --> 02:16:50.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:53.089 --> 02:16:53.099 align:start position:0%
the the next one was one judge one
 
02:16:53.099 --> 02:16:55.190 align:start position:0%
the the next one was one judge one
family

02:16:55.190 --> 02:16:55.200 align:start position:0%
family
 
02:16:57.889 --> 02:16:57.899 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to help kind of look into that
 
02:16:59.690 --> 02:16:59.700 align:start position:0%
one does anybody else want to join us to
 
02:17:03.290 --> 02:17:03.300 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:03.300 --> 02:17:04.009 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:17:04.009 --> 02:17:04.019 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:17:05.990 --> 02:17:06.000 align:start position:0%
best practice guidelines that was
 
02:17:07.310 --> 02:17:07.320 align:start position:0%
something that you had raised Brett
 
02:17:07.320 --> 02:17:12.110 align:start position:0%
something that you had raised Brett
Macbeth

02:17:12.110 --> 02:17:12.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:13.790 --> 02:17:13.800 align:start position:0%
um and I think I was talking about
 
02:17:15.830 --> 02:17:15.840 align:start position:0%
coordinating all the different wasn't
 
02:17:22.129 --> 02:17:22.139 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:24.530 --> 02:17:24.540 align:start position:0%
okay I mean
 
02:17:26.450 --> 02:17:26.460 align:start position:0%
oh was it I think was it related to Pro
 
02:17:28.009 --> 02:17:28.019 align:start position:0%
Se because if so I can take that one off
 
02:17:29.389 --> 02:17:29.399 align:start position:0%
if that's going to be related to the
 
02:17:31.969 --> 02:17:31.979 align:start position:0%
other one we already have I think
 
02:17:33.650 --> 02:17:33.660 align:start position:0%
I think we should all be looking at best
 
02:17:35.089 --> 02:17:35.099 align:start position:0%
practice in whatever area because I
 
02:17:36.230 --> 02:17:36.240 align:start position:0%
think I was mentioning it we were
 
02:17:37.969 --> 02:17:37.979 align:start position:0%
talking about police station drop-offs
 
02:17:37.979 --> 02:17:39.230 align:start position:0%
talking about police station drop-offs
or

02:17:39.230 --> 02:17:39.240 align:start position:0%
or
 
02:17:39.240 --> 02:17:40.490 align:start position:0%
or
um

02:17:40.490 --> 02:17:40.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:17:43.190 --> 02:17:43.200 align:start position:0%
even the the guardian ad litems how you
 
02:17:45.469 --> 02:17:45.479 align:start position:0%
know meshing them making sure they're on
 
02:17:46.730 --> 02:17:46.740 align:start position:0%
the same page
 
02:17:46.740 --> 02:17:48.410 align:start position:0%
the same page
um

02:17:48.410 --> 02:17:48.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:17:49.669 --> 02:17:49.679 align:start position:0%
and I think it was also we were talking
 
02:17:52.310 --> 02:17:52.320 align:start position:0%
about a training as well so yeah I don't
 
02:17:54.049 --> 02:17:54.059 align:start position:0%
I think that can be removed as far as
 
02:17:55.549 --> 02:17:55.559 align:start position:0%
any individual
 
02:17:55.559 --> 02:17:57.230 align:start position:0%
any individual
um

02:17:57.230 --> 02:17:57.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:17:59.810 --> 02:17:59.820 align:start position:0%
okay the next one is Rules of Evidence
 
02:18:01.730 --> 02:18:01.740 align:start position:0%
slash Discovery
 
02:18:05.030 --> 02:18:05.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:09.530 --> 02:18:09.540 align:start position:0%
and we do have that um June 16th memo
 
02:18:12.410 --> 02:18:12.420 align:start position:0%
that um
 
02:18:15.969 --> 02:18:15.979 align:start position:0%
researcher Grant had put together for us
 
02:18:20.089 --> 02:18:20.099 align:start position:0%
that does explain what the
 
02:18:24.290 --> 02:18:24.300 align:start position:0%
how the court has the Supreme Court has
 
02:18:27.889 --> 02:18:27.899 align:start position:0%
um ruled up until now on of course the
 
02:18:30.530 --> 02:18:30.540 align:start position:0%
legislature could
 
02:18:34.070 --> 02:18:34.080 align:start position:0%
um involve itself and so there is a bell
 
02:18:35.810 --> 02:18:35.820 align:start position:0%
rep ball it's raising your hand there's
 
02:18:39.230 --> 02:18:39.240 align:start position:0%
a bill in fam Court already HP 4.99 and
 
02:18:41.030 --> 02:18:41.040 align:start position:0%
what is that
 
02:18:43.549 --> 02:18:43.559 align:start position:0%
House Bill 495 is Rules of Evidence in
 
02:18:45.469 --> 02:18:45.479 align:start position:0%
the family court and that is in this
 
02:18:47.230 --> 02:18:47.240 align:start position:0%
Committee in in
 
02:18:50.030 --> 02:18:50.040 align:start position:0%
commit it's 4.99 you have on there not
 
02:18:54.709 --> 02:18:54.719 align:start position:0%
4.95. 4.99 yeah 4.99 okay and then in
 
02:18:58.549 --> 02:18:58.559 align:start position:0%
the children family law okay
 
02:18:58.559 --> 02:18:59.870 align:start position:0%
the children family law okay
um

02:18:59.870 --> 02:18:59.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:19:01.610 --> 02:19:01.620 align:start position:0%
I mean I think we I would like to look
 
02:19:02.750 --> 02:19:02.760 align:start position:0%
into that even if it's in children
 
02:19:04.370 --> 02:19:04.380 align:start position:0%
family mall it's still specifically
 
02:19:05.990 --> 02:19:06.000 align:start position:0%
related to the functioning of the family
 
02:19:13.549 --> 02:19:13.559 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:15.650 --> 02:19:15.660 align:start position:0%
all right and then the final piece is
 
02:19:17.509 --> 02:19:17.519 align:start position:0%
the family law training slash continuing
 
02:19:20.089 --> 02:19:20.099 align:start position:0%
ad for judges which
 
02:19:21.950 --> 02:19:21.960 align:start position:0%
I think can be explored either way
 
02:19:23.870 --> 02:19:23.880 align:start position:0%
because there is that there is under
 
02:19:26.330 --> 02:19:26.340 align:start position:0%
statue something now so I do think that
 
02:19:27.589 --> 02:19:27.599 align:start position:0%
is something that we could potentially
 
02:19:29.570 --> 02:19:29.580 align:start position:0%
you know look at and see which area we
 
02:19:31.669 --> 02:19:31.679 align:start position:0%
want to put it into and I'd I would like
 
02:19:35.330 --> 02:19:35.340 align:start position:0%
to look at that um I would too so me too
 
02:19:38.750 --> 02:19:38.760 align:start position:0%
okay so that's okay
 
02:19:40.490 --> 02:19:40.500 align:start position:0%
very good
 
02:19:42.469 --> 02:19:42.479 align:start position:0%
Madam chairman yes
 
02:19:43.910 --> 02:19:43.920 align:start position:0%
um also there's I don't know if I
 
02:19:48.049 --> 02:19:48.059 align:start position:0%
mentioned it um House Bill 475 and that
 
02:19:50.389 --> 02:19:50.399 align:start position:0%
also has to do with the right to submit
 
02:19:52.010 --> 02:19:52.020 align:start position:0%
evidence testimony and family court
 
02:19:54.110 --> 02:19:54.120 align:start position:0%
proceedings and that's also in children
 
02:19:57.889 --> 02:19:57.899 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:57.899 --> 02:19:59.750 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:19:59.750 --> 02:19:59.760 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:20:02.030 --> 02:20:02.040 align:start position:0%
well clearly there's going to be a lot
 
02:20:03.889 --> 02:20:03.899 align:start position:0%
of overlap between the work that
 
02:20:05.690 --> 02:20:05.700 align:start position:0%
children and family law committee is
 
02:20:07.670 --> 02:20:07.680 align:start position:0%
doing and
 
02:20:07.680 --> 02:20:08.330 align:start position:0%
doing and
um

02:20:08.330 --> 02:20:08.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:20:11.210 --> 02:20:11.220 align:start position:0%
there's no need for this committee to
 
02:20:13.310 --> 02:20:13.320 align:start position:0%
reinvent the wheel but the reason that
 
02:20:15.230 --> 02:20:15.240 align:start position:0%
there are five members from children
 
02:20:17.210 --> 02:20:17.220 align:start position:0%
family law and five members from
 
02:20:20.630 --> 02:20:20.640 align:start position:0%
Judiciary is for you know is
 
02:20:22.550 --> 02:20:22.560 align:start position:0%
demonstrated in in the fact that there
 
02:20:25.550 --> 02:20:25.560 align:start position:0%
are these bills that are are pending in
 
02:20:28.370 --> 02:20:28.380 align:start position:0%
children and family law any number of
 
02:20:31.429 --> 02:20:31.439 align:start position:0%
which bills were part of the impetus to
 
02:20:35.210 --> 02:20:35.220 align:start position:0%
create this special committee so we want
 
02:20:37.310 --> 02:20:37.320 align:start position:0%
children and family law to do their due
 
02:20:38.929 --> 02:20:38.939 align:start position:0%
diligence but they're also clearly
 
02:20:41.990 --> 02:20:42.000 align:start position:0%
there's a role for this committee to be
 
02:20:42.000 --> 02:20:43.730 align:start position:0%
there's a role for this committee to be
involved

02:20:43.730 --> 02:20:43.740 align:start position:0%
involved
 
02:20:43.740 --> 02:20:44.570 align:start position:0%
involved
um

02:20:44.570 --> 02:20:44.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:20:47.030 --> 02:20:47.040 align:start position:0%
representative long so uh thank you
 
02:20:49.969 --> 02:20:49.979 align:start position:0%
madam chair so the timeline is on what
 
02:20:51.590 --> 02:20:51.600 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at
 
02:20:51.600 --> 02:20:53.210 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at
um I

02:20:53.210 --> 02:20:53.220 align:start position:0%
um I
 
02:20:54.889 --> 02:20:54.899 align:start position:0%
I wouldn't advise children and family
 
02:20:57.110 --> 02:20:57.120 align:start position:0%
law to come up with Solutions
 
02:20:57.120 --> 02:20:59.450 align:start position:0%
law to come up with Solutions
that

02:20:59.450 --> 02:20:59.460 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:21:03.710 --> 02:21:03.720 align:start position:0%
in this in this committee come up with
 
02:21:05.630 --> 02:21:05.640 align:start position:0%
different solutions
 
02:21:07.550 --> 02:21:07.560 align:start position:0%
you know what I mean so what's that
 
02:21:09.110 --> 02:21:09.120 align:start position:0%
timeline I know we're looking in
 
02:21:10.849 --> 02:21:10.859 align:start position:0%
September to
 
02:21:10.859 --> 02:21:11.510 align:start position:0%
September to
um

02:21:11.510 --> 02:21:11.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:21:14.030 --> 02:21:14.040 align:start position:0%
to start subcommittee work
 
02:21:15.770 --> 02:21:15.780 align:start position:0%
on our bills yeah according to the email
 
02:21:18.410 --> 02:21:18.420 align:start position:0%
that I received it was going to be
 
02:21:20.469 --> 02:21:20.479 align:start position:0%
chairman Pearson myself
 
02:21:23.030 --> 02:21:23.040 align:start position:0%
representative McMahon representative
 
02:21:26.210 --> 02:21:26.220 align:start position:0%
Greg and you that we're going on those
 
02:21:31.370 --> 02:21:31.380 align:start position:0%
particular 475 499 and what 471. okay so
 
02:21:33.170 --> 02:21:33.180 align:start position:0%
so I'm looking for the timeline as to
 
02:21:34.490 --> 02:21:34.500 align:start position:0%
when we're going to start discussing
 
02:21:36.530 --> 02:21:36.540 align:start position:0%
those and children and family law and
 
02:21:38.389 --> 02:21:38.399 align:start position:0%
what is this committee going to come
 
02:21:42.309 --> 02:21:42.319 align:start position:0%
with some discussion and suggestions
 
02:21:44.090 --> 02:21:44.100 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I was just going to say
 
02:21:45.410 --> 02:21:45.420 align:start position:0%
according to the email it said the
 
02:21:48.290 --> 02:21:48.300 align:start position:0%
groups will formally meet in the fall
 
02:21:50.270 --> 02:21:50.280 align:start position:0%
so I think for us though we can
 
02:21:52.790 --> 02:21:52.800 align:start position:0%
informally kind of take on some of this
 
02:21:54.710 --> 02:21:54.720 align:start position:0%
work in the summer to look into stuff
 
02:21:56.750 --> 02:21:56.760 align:start position:0%
and maybe come up with some solutions to
 
02:21:59.809 --> 02:21:59.819 align:start position:0%
present to the committee in the fall but
 
02:22:01.790 --> 02:22:01.800 align:start position:0%
that we're not actually doing any work
 
02:22:04.250 --> 02:22:04.260 align:start position:0%
because we can't July oh we may or may
 
02:22:06.410 --> 02:22:06.420 align:start position:0%
not come up with Solutions but we may
 
02:22:08.150 --> 02:22:08.160 align:start position:0%
come up with
 
02:22:10.849 --> 02:22:10.859 align:start position:0%
um a clearer
 
02:22:15.110 --> 02:22:15.120 align:start position:0%
um uh description or definition of the
 
02:22:20.450 --> 02:22:20.460 align:start position:0%
problem that might need Solutions and
 
02:22:24.650 --> 02:22:24.660 align:start position:0%
that we shouldn't Begin by assuming that
 
02:22:27.410 --> 02:22:27.420 align:start position:0%
we know everything there is to know and
 
02:22:28.730 --> 02:22:28.740 align:start position:0%
that we know
 
02:22:32.230 --> 02:22:32.240 align:start position:0%
X is right and Y is well wrong because
 
02:22:36.469 --> 02:22:36.479 align:start position:0%
there's just a lot of complexity in all
 
02:22:39.889 --> 02:22:39.899 align:start position:0%
of these issues I also know that there
 
02:22:43.610 --> 02:22:43.620 align:start position:0%
are a number of national
 
02:22:43.620 --> 02:22:45.230 align:start position:0%
are a number of national
um

02:22:45.230 --> 02:22:45.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:22:48.950 --> 02:22:48.960 align:start position:0%
institutions which have looked at these
 
02:22:51.590 --> 02:22:51.600 align:start position:0%
issues have evaluated what's going on in
 
02:22:53.110 --> 02:22:53.120 align:start position:0%
in different states I know
 
02:22:55.250 --> 02:22:55.260 align:start position:0%
representative Greg has mentioned
 
02:22:57.290 --> 02:22:57.300 align:start position:0%
several of them I have looked at some of
 
02:22:58.969 --> 02:22:58.979 align:start position:0%
them I'm sure some of the rest of you
 
02:23:02.090 --> 02:23:02.100 align:start position:0%
have also and I would hope that during
 
02:23:03.710 --> 02:23:03.720 align:start position:0%
the summer
 
02:23:07.429 --> 02:23:07.439 align:start position:0%
um when you're not sitting in a in a
 
02:23:09.830 --> 02:23:09.840 align:start position:0%
lounge chair eating chocolate bon bons
 
02:23:13.550 --> 02:23:13.560 align:start position:0%
and reading mystery stories that you
 
02:23:17.330 --> 02:23:17.340 align:start position:0%
might want to look at what
 
02:23:21.889 --> 02:23:21.899 align:start position:0%
what some of the national resources have
 
02:23:24.950 --> 02:23:24.960 align:start position:0%
suggested about these issues and
 
02:23:26.830 --> 02:23:26.840 align:start position:0%
recognizing that sometimes a national
 
02:23:29.750 --> 02:23:29.760 align:start position:0%
suggestion or solution doesn't apply in
 
02:23:32.690 --> 02:23:32.700 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire we know we we tend to
 
02:23:34.969 --> 02:23:34.979 align:start position:0%
march to our own drummers sometimes with
 
02:23:36.530 --> 02:23:36.540 align:start position:0%
good reasons sometimes without good
 
02:23:38.330 --> 02:23:38.340 align:start position:0%
reason but I don't think we should
 
02:23:41.389 --> 02:23:41.399 align:start position:0%
assume that we know the outcome now or
 
02:23:43.130 --> 02:23:43.140 align:start position:0%
at least I would hope that we don't
 
02:23:45.410 --> 02:23:45.420 align:start position:0%
assume we know the outcome that all we
 
02:23:48.230 --> 02:23:48.240 align:start position:0%
know is that these are are problems that
 
02:23:50.150 --> 02:23:50.160 align:start position:0%
that bear
 
02:23:53.510 --> 02:23:53.520 align:start position:0%
looking into is that is that a fair
 
02:23:53.520 --> 02:23:55.010 align:start position:0%
looking into is that is that a fair
assessment

02:23:55.010 --> 02:23:55.020 align:start position:0%
assessment
 
02:23:58.010 --> 02:23:58.020 align:start position:0%
and um of course chairman Pearson's
 
02:24:00.010 --> 02:24:00.020 align:start position:0%
going to want to
 
02:24:03.410 --> 02:24:03.420 align:start position:0%
be involved and and exert his leadership
 
02:24:05.330 --> 02:24:05.340 align:start position:0%
role in this
 
02:24:07.790 --> 02:24:07.800 align:start position:0%
um but that will not happen until until
 
02:24:09.190 --> 02:24:09.200 align:start position:0%
the fall
 
02:24:11.030 --> 02:24:11.040 align:start position:0%
we will
 
02:24:14.030 --> 02:24:14.040 align:start position:0%
um give him he'll be able to watch this
 
02:24:16.610 --> 02:24:16.620 align:start position:0%
if he isn't watching it at the moment
 
02:24:19.550 --> 02:24:19.560 align:start position:0%
um and we'll give him a very detailed
 
02:24:22.670 --> 02:24:22.680 align:start position:0%
report of what we talked about but
 
02:24:25.190 --> 02:24:25.200 align:start position:0%
understanding that it's just
 
02:24:25.200 --> 02:24:25.809 align:start position:0%
understanding that it's just
um

02:24:25.809 --> 02:24:25.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:24:29.570 --> 02:24:29.580 align:start position:0%
giving us uh giving us an opportunity to
 
02:24:31.550 --> 02:24:31.560 align:start position:0%
come back in September and say what we
 
02:24:34.610 --> 02:24:34.620 align:start position:0%
did with our summer vacation
 
02:24:37.190 --> 02:24:37.200 align:start position:0%
uh can we Circle back to a few that
 
02:24:38.750 --> 02:24:38.760 align:start position:0%
didn't really have many people like
 
02:24:40.309 --> 02:24:40.319 align:start position:0%
working on them and see if anybody else
 
02:24:41.690 --> 02:24:41.700 align:start position:0%
was interested now that we've gone
 
02:24:43.250 --> 02:24:43.260 align:start position:0%
through everything so the neutral case
 
02:24:44.990 --> 02:24:45.000 align:start position:0%
evaluation expansion I was the only one
 
02:24:46.190 --> 02:24:46.200 align:start position:0%
who had interest on that one does
 
02:24:47.809 --> 02:24:47.819 align:start position:0%
anybody else want to I'm I'm interested
 
02:24:51.230 --> 02:24:51.240 align:start position:0%
in that representative Macbeth okay
 
02:24:53.750 --> 02:24:53.760 align:start position:0%
um so ball and Macbeth
 
02:24:55.790 --> 02:24:55.800 align:start position:0%
um and then what about child support
 
02:24:57.230 --> 02:24:57.240 align:start position:0%
because I think that's going to be
 
02:24:59.389 --> 02:24:59.399 align:start position:0%
another really big one you'd like to
 
02:25:01.910 --> 02:25:01.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:04.550 --> 02:25:04.560 align:start position:0%
um and I think everything else oh so the
 
02:25:08.150 --> 02:25:08.160 align:start position:0%
the child support uh
 
02:25:09.469 --> 02:25:09.479 align:start position:0%
um I think the only other one that there
 
02:25:10.670 --> 02:25:10.680 align:start position:0%
was nobody else was the Rules of
 
02:25:12.349 --> 02:25:12.359 align:start position:0%
Evidence slash Discovery regulations I
 
02:25:13.610 --> 02:25:13.620 align:start position:0%
know there were some retained Bells
 
02:25:15.530 --> 02:25:15.540 align:start position:0%
Rhett McBeth you indicated that you'd
 
02:25:17.270 --> 02:25:17.280 align:start position:0%
also like to be a part of that is there
 
02:25:19.429 --> 02:25:19.439 align:start position:0%
somebody that's on all of that in
 
02:25:19.439 --> 02:25:20.450 align:start position:0%
somebody that's on all of that in
addition

02:25:20.450 --> 02:25:20.460 align:start position:0%
addition
 
02:25:24.889 --> 02:25:24.899 align:start position:0%
oh rep Greg rep long and yourself okay
 
02:25:27.050 --> 02:25:27.060 align:start position:0%
I I believe what I heard representative
 
02:25:30.170 --> 02:25:30.180 align:start position:0%
balls say is that on those bills that
 
02:25:32.210 --> 02:25:32.220 align:start position:0%
relate to the work here
 
02:25:35.450 --> 02:25:35.460 align:start position:0%
all of the children and family law
 
02:25:37.429 --> 02:25:37.439 align:start position:0%
members of this committee are on those
 
02:25:37.439 --> 02:25:38.389 align:start position:0%
members of this committee are on those
bills

02:25:38.389 --> 02:25:38.399 align:start position:0%
bills
 
02:25:38.399 --> 02:25:42.650 align:start position:0%
bills
okay

02:25:42.650 --> 02:25:42.660 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:42.660 --> 02:25:44.210 align:start position:0%
 
representation

02:25:44.210 --> 02:25:44.220 align:start position:0%
representation
 
02:25:44.220 --> 02:25:46.010 align:start position:0%
representation
right

02:25:46.010 --> 02:25:46.020 align:start position:0%
right
 
02:25:46.020 --> 02:25:46.969 align:start position:0%
right
um

02:25:46.969 --> 02:25:46.979 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:25:48.830 --> 02:25:48.840 align:start position:0%
yeah um
 
02:25:52.130 --> 02:25:52.140 align:start position:0%
I I we've just been told that the LSR
 
02:25:55.370 --> 02:25:55.380 align:start position:0%
filing dates are September 11th and 15th
 
02:25:57.950 --> 02:25:57.960 align:start position:0%
but um I don't that doesn't apply to
 
02:26:01.010 --> 02:26:01.020 align:start position:0%
this committee's special committees can
 
02:26:03.490 --> 02:26:03.500 align:start position:0%
um ask the rules committee at any time
 
02:26:07.250 --> 02:26:07.260 align:start position:0%
uh for bills it does apply if you know
 
02:26:09.710 --> 02:26:09.720 align:start position:0%
for anybody who on their own want to
 
02:26:13.190 --> 02:26:13.200 align:start position:0%
come in with uh their own legislation on
 
02:26:14.750 --> 02:26:14.760 align:start position:0%
these bills
 
02:26:16.969 --> 02:26:16.979 align:start position:0%
um the bills that are retained have to
 
02:26:19.670 --> 02:26:19.680 align:start position:0%
be out by November 17th and that would
 
02:26:23.150 --> 02:26:23.160 align:start position:0%
be about the time that we would want to
 
02:26:26.270 --> 02:26:26.280 align:start position:0%
have a a final report
 
02:26:28.849 --> 02:26:28.859 align:start position:0%
anything else for the good of the group
 
02:26:32.030 --> 02:26:32.040 align:start position:0%
that we should talk about now
 
02:26:37.010 --> 02:26:37.020 align:start position:0%
um I I really am incredibly
 
02:26:40.070 --> 02:26:40.080 align:start position:0%
appreciative of all the time that people
 
02:26:42.770 --> 02:26:42.780 align:start position:0%
have have put into this I think everyone
 
02:26:45.349 --> 02:26:45.359 align:start position:0%
on this committee has taken it seriously
 
02:26:48.230 --> 02:26:48.240 align:start position:0%
it's a complicated issue there are no
 
02:26:50.450 --> 02:26:50.460 align:start position:0%
easy answers
 
02:26:55.370 --> 02:26:55.380 align:start position:0%
um and uh we will come back in the fall
 
02:26:57.530 --> 02:26:57.540 align:start position:0%
obviously some of us will will chat
 
02:26:57.540 --> 02:26:59.530 align:start position:0%
obviously some of us will will chat
informally

02:26:59.530 --> 02:26:59.540 align:start position:0%
informally
 
02:27:04.570 --> 02:27:04.580 align:start position:0%
with each other but in no way that um
 
02:27:08.210 --> 02:27:08.220 align:start position:0%
that conflicts with our commitment to
 
02:27:08.220 --> 02:27:09.849 align:start position:0%
that conflicts with our commitment to
91a

02:27:09.849 --> 02:27:09.859 align:start position:0%
91a
 
02:27:13.429 --> 02:27:13.439 align:start position:0%
so we will not be you know
 
02:27:15.230 --> 02:27:15.240 align:start position:0%
conducting business we might be talking
 
02:27:16.730 --> 02:27:16.740 align:start position:0%
about scheduling you might be talking
 
02:27:19.130 --> 02:27:19.140 align:start position:0%
about other kinds of things
 
02:27:23.210 --> 02:27:23.220 align:start position:0%
um and we will meet again at the
 
02:27:25.429 --> 02:27:25.439 align:start position:0%
chairman Pearsons
 
02:27:25.439 --> 02:27:26.630 align:start position:0%
chairman Pearsons
um

02:27:26.630 --> 02:27:26.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:27:26.640 --> 02:27:27.889 align:start position:0%
um
uh

02:27:27.889 --> 02:27:27.899 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:27:30.530 --> 02:27:30.540 align:start position:0%
control when he announces what our first
 
02:27:33.349 --> 02:27:33.359 align:start position:0%
meeting in September would be
 
02:27:37.070 --> 02:27:37.080 align:start position:0%
um but if there's nothing else I'd like
 
02:27:39.950 --> 02:27:39.960 align:start position:0%
to again thank everybody and
 
02:27:43.429 --> 02:27:43.439 align:start position:0%

02:27:45.889 --> 02:27:45.899 align:start position:0%
understand how complicated the issues
 
02:27:47.990 --> 02:27:48.000 align:start position:0%
are how many problems
 
02:27:50.210 --> 02:27:50.220 align:start position:0%
there are out there for which they're
 
02:27:53.870 --> 02:27:53.880 align:start position:0%
likely not easy answers and
 
02:27:57.610 --> 02:27:57.620 align:start position:0%
um that we will return
 
02:28:02.330 --> 02:28:02.340 align:start position:0%
and we are during
 
02:28:02.340 --> 02:28:08.330 align:start position:0%
and we are during
okay

02:28:08.330 --> 02:28:08.340 align:start position:0%
