Raymond thank you Mr
 
00:17:55.270 --> 00:17:55.280 align:start position:0%
Speaker good morning currently the
 
00:17:58.390 --> 00:17:58.400 align:start position:0%
statute requires that judges in custody
 
00:18:01.350 --> 00:18:01.360 align:start position:0%
cases consider the best interest of the
 
00:18:04.950 --> 00:18:04.960 align:start position:0%
child when deciding parenting plans this
 
00:18:07.149 --> 00:18:07.159 align:start position:0%
bill would change that language to
 
00:18:09.909 --> 00:18:09.919 align:start position:0%
requiring the court to use approximately
 
00:18:13.070 --> 00:18:13.080 align:start position:0%
equal parenting time this change in
 
00:18:15.870 --> 00:18:15.880 align:start position:0%
language removes the focus on child's
 
00:18:18.350 --> 00:18:18.360 align:start position:0%
needs and creates a one siiz fits-all
 
00:18:21.909 --> 00:18:21.919 align:start position:0%
solution that actually fits very few fam
 
00:18:26.230 --> 00:18:26.240 align:start position:0%
situations currently 85% of families are
 
00:18:28.950 --> 00:18:28.960 align:start position:0%
able to come to agreement without the
 
00:18:31.190 --> 00:18:31.200 align:start position:0%
judge having to make an order that they
 
00:18:34.310 --> 00:18:34.320 align:start position:0%
have to comply with only about 15% of
 
00:18:37.590 --> 00:18:37.600 align:start position:0%
high conflict divorce cases uh involve
 
00:18:40.149 --> 00:18:40.159 align:start position:0%
parents who cannot get on the same page
 
00:18:42.390 --> 00:18:42.400 align:start position:0%
and create a parenting plan on their
 
00:18:47.270 --> 00:18:47.280 align:start position:0%
own this new language ignores the child
 
00:18:49.870 --> 00:18:49.880 align:start position:0%
in the conversation about parenting
 
00:18:53.230 --> 00:18:53.240 align:start position:0%
plans it ignores children's activities
 
00:18:56.110 --> 00:18:56.120 align:start position:0%
and schedules for example children who
 
00:18:59.470 --> 00:18:59.480 align:start position:0%
play sports children who are in count
 
00:19:02.190 --> 00:19:02.200 align:start position:0%
um scouting children who have part-time
 
00:19:05.149 --> 00:19:05.159 align:start position:0%
jobs because remember from the age of
 
00:19:07.669 --> 00:19:07.679 align:start position:0%
three or four until 18 which is the
 
00:19:10.710 --> 00:19:10.720 align:start position:0%
majority of childhood our kids are doing
 
00:19:12.950 --> 00:19:12.960 align:start position:0%
things and when you don't look at what
 
00:19:15.190 --> 00:19:15.200 align:start position:0%
the child is doing and you only look at
 
00:19:17.669 --> 00:19:17.679 align:start position:0%
the parents and say half and half you're
 
00:19:20.590 --> 00:19:20.600 align:start position:0%
ignoring what's best for those
 
00:19:24.230 --> 00:19:24.240 align:start position:0%
kids this language also ignores the
 
00:19:26.750 --> 00:19:26.760 align:start position:0%
realities of the complex family living
 
00:19:29.149 --> 00:19:29.159 align:start position:0%
situations that we have today for
 
00:19:31.310 --> 00:19:31.320 align:start position:0%
example how does one achieve
 
00:19:33.630 --> 00:19:33.640 align:start position:0%
approximately equal parenting time when
 
00:19:35.430 --> 00:19:35.440 align:start position:0%
parents live in two different school
 
00:19:40.270 --> 00:19:40.280 align:start position:0%
districts again for 12 years most kids
 
00:19:43.110 --> 00:19:43.120 align:start position:0%
are in school how do families manage
 
00:19:45.029 --> 00:19:45.039 align:start position:0%
that how do they manage when they live
 
00:19:46.990 --> 00:19:47.000 align:start position:0%
far apart and they need to arrange two
 
00:19:48.950 --> 00:19:48.960 align:start position:0%
different daycare providers for their
 
00:19:53.350 --> 00:19:53.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:56.830 --> 00:19:56.840 align:start position:0%
time this language treats children as
 
00:19:59.990 --> 00:20:00.000 align:start position:0%
marital property to be div divided up
 
00:20:03.870 --> 00:20:03.880 align:start position:0%
when marriages fail that's not good for
 
00:20:07.830 --> 00:20:07.840 align:start position:0%
kids we should not be making divorce
 
00:20:11.270 --> 00:20:11.280 align:start position:0%
harder on children we should be allowing
 
00:20:14.789 --> 00:20:14.799 align:start position:0%
our courts to put the focus on what's
 
00:20:16.870 --> 00:20:16.880 align:start position:0%
best for kids when they are going
 
00:20:20.230 --> 00:20:20.240 align:start position:0%
through these difficult family events so
 
00:20:23.310 --> 00:20:23.320 align:start position:0%
I agree that the current language is not
 
00:20:26.669 --> 00:20:26.679 align:start position:0%
perfect however it works for the vast
 
00:20:29.990 --> 00:20:30.000 align:start position:0%
majority of families and this language
 
00:20:32.230 --> 00:20:32.240 align:start position:0%
will hurt all families going through
 
00:20:35.110 --> 00:20:35.120 align:start position:0%
divorce so I ask everyone to non-c
 
00:20:38.470 --> 00:20:38.480 align:start position:0%
Concur and I ask for a division
 
00:20:44.950 --> 00:20:44.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:47.470 --> 00:20:47.480 align:start position:0%
Pearson in my opinion it was not a bad
 
00:20:49.630 --> 00:20:49.640 align:start position:0%
Bill to start with but the Senate added
 
00:20:54.149 --> 00:20:54.159 align:start position:0%
the phrase the best interests of the
 
00:20:57.270 --> 00:20:57.280 align:start position:0%
child and to me that's an important
 
00:20:57.280 --> 00:20:59.750 align:start position:0%
child and to me that's an important
Improvement

00:20:59.750 --> 00:20:59.760 align:start position:0%
Improvement
 
00:21:02.750 --> 00:21:02.760 align:start position:0%
and my hearing not being what it is if a
 
00:21:04.510 --> 00:21:04.520 align:start position:0%
division wasn't called for I would like
 
00:21:09.190 --> 00:21:09.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:11.630 --> 00:21:11.640 align:start position:0%

substantial and material to one sentence
 
00:25:16.350 --> 00:25:16.360 align:start position:0%
here are the two versions our version
 
00:25:20.310 --> 00:25:20.320 align:start position:0%
read upon finding by the court pursuant
 
00:25:23.470 --> 00:25:23.480 align:start position:0%
to a motion for Family Access order or a
 
00:25:25.950 --> 00:25:25.960 align:start position:0%
motion for contempt that its order for

parenting time has not been complied
 
00:25:32.830 --> 00:25:32.840 align:start position:0%
with their version reads parenting time
 
00:25:36.990 --> 00:25:37.000 align:start position:0%
has been substantially and materially
 
00:25:39.870 --> 00:25:39.880 align:start position:0%
violated I'm a co-sponsor of this bill I
 
00:25:41.789 --> 00:25:41.799 align:start position:0%
believe the Senate version makes it
 
00:25:44.870 --> 00:25:44.880 align:start position:0%
clear the court will not take action if
 
00:25:49.149 --> 00:25:49.159 align:start position:0%
somebody is once in violation in a very
 
00:25:51.990 --> 00:25:52.000 align:start position:0%
minor way that was a concern of some
 
00:25:54.350 --> 00:25:54.360 align:start position:0%
folks the Senate addressed that that it
 
00:25:56.110 --> 00:25:56.120 align:start position:0%
would have to be substantial and
 
00:25:59.470 --> 00:25:59.480 align:start position:0%
material violations I comfortable with
 
00:26:02.630 --> 00:26:02.640 align:start position:0%
that I ask that we concur with the
 
00:26:05.269 --> 00:26:05.279 align:start position:0%

colleagues um this bill like so many
 
00:36:44.390 --> 00:36:44.400 align:start position:0%
others has expanded Beyond its original
 
00:36:47.069 --> 00:36:47.079 align:start position:0%
intent and now includes language from s
 
00:36:49.430 --> 00:36:49.440 align:start position:0%
sp504 which is a bill on a completely
 
00:36:51.829 --> 00:36:51.839 align:start position:0%
different topic as I'm sure many of you
 
00:36:54.230 --> 00:36:54.240 align:start position:0%
know in New Hampshire unless private
 
00:36:56.190 --> 00:36:56.200 align:start position:0%
property is posted with no trespassing
 
00:36:58.470 --> 00:36:58.480 align:start position:0%
signs folks in New sure are welcome to
 
00:37:00.390 --> 00:37:00.400 align:start position:0%
do recreational activity on that
 
00:37:03.069 --> 00:37:03.079 align:start position:0%
property this includes skiing hiking
 
00:37:06.109 --> 00:37:06.119 align:start position:0%
snowshoeing Etc Property Owners receive
 
00:37:07.829 --> 00:37:07.839 align:start position:0%
a tax break for leaving their property
 
00:37:10.390 --> 00:37:10.400 align:start position:0%
open to the public the language that has
 
00:37:12.470 --> 00:37:12.480 align:start position:0%
been inserted into this bill seeks to
 
00:37:14.349 --> 00:37:14.359 align:start position:0%
allow Property Owners to post no
 
00:37:16.950 --> 00:37:16.960 align:start position:0%
trespassing except for a specific list
 
00:37:19.030 --> 00:37:19.040 align:start position:0%
of recreational activities and then
 
00:37:21.630 --> 00:37:21.640 align:start position:0%
still receive the tax credit when the
 
00:37:23.230 --> 00:37:23.240 align:start position:0%
bill was introduced in our committee
 
00:37:25.109 --> 00:37:25.119 align:start position:0%
originally the prime sponsor explained
 
00:37:26.630 --> 00:37:26.640 align:start position:0%
that the intention was to allow law
 
00:37:28.630 --> 00:37:28.640 align:start position:0%
enforcement officials to go onto these
 
00:37:30.910 --> 00:37:30.920 align:start position:0%
properties and arrest individuals for
 
00:37:33.470 --> 00:37:33.480 align:start position:0%
trespassing as a way to address
 
00:37:35.550 --> 00:37:35.560 align:start position:0%
theoretical border crossings in Northern
 
00:37:38.069 --> 00:37:38.079 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire I asked in committee how
 
00:37:39.309 --> 00:37:39.319 align:start position:0%
law enforcement would tell the
 
00:37:40.990 --> 00:37:41.000 align:start position:0%
difference between someone backpacking
 
00:37:43.069 --> 00:37:43.079 align:start position:0%
or hiking and someone who is supposedly
 
00:37:46.030 --> 00:37:46.040 align:start position:0%
trespassing on these public lands there
 
00:37:48.550 --> 00:37:48.560 align:start position:0%
was no answer to that question we also
 
00:37:50.190 --> 00:37:50.200 align:start position:0%
asked what kind of impact this bill
 
00:37:52.069 --> 00:37:52.079 align:start position:0%
would have on actually stopping illegal
 
00:37:53.710 --> 00:37:53.720 align:start position:0%
border crossings and the sponsor
 
00:37:56.270 --> 00:37:56.280 align:start position:0%
admitted that it would be very minimal
 
00:37:58.230 --> 00:37:58.240 align:start position:0%
in my eyes it is very clear that this
 
00:37:59.710 --> 00:37:59.720 align:start position:0%
bill would inevitably lead to the
 
00:38:01.710 --> 00:38:01.720 align:start position:0%
unnecessary stops of black and brown
 
00:38:03.270 --> 00:38:03.280 align:start position:0%
people who participate in these
 
00:38:06.150 --> 00:38:06.160 align:start position:0%
recreational activities as it is many
 
00:38:07.910 --> 00:38:07.920 align:start position:0%
members of my Latino Community are
 
00:38:09.710 --> 00:38:09.720 align:start position:0%
detained and forced to show proof of
 
00:38:11.790 --> 00:38:11.800 align:start position:0%
citizenship when simply traveling up
 
00:38:14.069 --> 00:38:14.079 align:start position:0%
north these racially motivated
 
00:38:15.990 --> 00:38:16.000 align:start position:0%
detainments are unconstitutional
 
00:38:17.910 --> 00:38:17.920 align:start position:0%
dangerous and discourage granted Staters
 
00:38:20.069 --> 00:38:20.079 align:start position:0%
from participating in everything our
 
00:38:22.309 --> 00:38:22.319 align:start position:0%
state has to offer the freedoms that we
 
00:38:24.430 --> 00:38:24.440 align:start position:0%
all have a right to I would urge you all
 
00:38:25.990 --> 00:38:26.000 align:start position:0%
to vote against this motion so a better
 
00:38:28.470 --> 00:38:28.480 align:start position:0%
motion can be made thank you
 
00:38:35.270 --> 00:38:35.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:38.069 --> 00:38:38.079 align:start position:0%
hunt uh thank you Mr Speaker uh the
 
00:38:39.950 --> 00:38:39.960 align:start position:0%
underlying bill is a pretty important
 
00:38:41.870 --> 00:38:41.880 align:start position:0%
bill to the Commerce Committee it has a
 
00:38:44.750 --> 00:38:44.760 align:start position:0%
bunch of series of issues um that we
 
00:38:47.510 --> 00:38:47.520 align:start position:0%
were working on including uh addressing
 
00:38:49.190 --> 00:38:49.200 align:start position:0%
the uh issue of
 
00:38:53.190 --> 00:38:53.200 align:start position:0%
hookas um so when I I got this uh
 
00:38:56.550 --> 00:38:56.560 align:start position:0%
amendment I called up the chair uh
 
00:38:58.150 --> 00:38:58.160 align:start position:0%
criminal justice and and asked him I
 
00:38:59.589 --> 00:38:59.599 align:start position:0%
said what's what happened what's the
 
00:39:02.589 --> 00:39:02.599 align:start position:0%
story with this issue and he said um
 
00:39:04.470 --> 00:39:04.480 align:start position:0%
that the committee overwhelmingly
 
00:39:07.309 --> 00:39:07.319 align:start position:0%
supported it nobody called me and told
 
00:39:09.109 --> 00:39:09.119 align:start position:0%
me there was a problem with this bill
 
00:39:11.270 --> 00:39:11.280 align:start position:0%
this amendment I had not heard anything
 
00:39:13.150 --> 00:39:13.160 align:start position:0%
and believe me I was making a lot of
 
00:39:15.630 --> 00:39:15.640 align:start position:0%
phone calls to let everybody know that I
 
00:39:17.990 --> 00:39:18.000 align:start position:0%
would want to hear if there's anything I
 
00:39:20.309 --> 00:39:20.319 align:start position:0%
should know and I did not hear anything
 
00:39:22.870 --> 00:39:22.880 align:start position:0%
so this is all a surprise to me and I
 
00:39:25.630 --> 00:39:25.640 align:start position:0%
would hope you to uh support this motion
 
00:39:28.829 --> 00:39:28.839 align:start position:0%
so we can actually get these uh this
 
00:39:31.710 --> 00:39:31.720 align:start position:0%

inquiry thank you Mr Speaker if I know
 
00:40:59.870 --> 00:40:59.880 align:start position:0%
that the underlying Bill 1018 was
 
00:41:02.550 --> 00:41:02.560 align:start position:0%
overwhelmingly passed by both bodies and
 
00:41:04.390 --> 00:41:04.400 align:start position:0%
if I know that the bill attached by the
 
00:41:07.510 --> 00:41:07.520 align:start position:0%
body over the wall is a dangerous one
 
00:41:09.630 --> 00:41:09.640 align:start position:0%
that makes assumptions about trespassers
 
00:41:11.910 --> 00:41:11.920 align:start position:0%
on our land and if I know that the
 
00:41:13.910 --> 00:41:13.920 align:start position:0%
attached bill would make it nearly
 
00:41:16.150 --> 00:41:16.160 align:start position:0%
impossible for law enforcement to
 
00:41:17.990 --> 00:41:18.000 align:start position:0%

as amended by the
 
01:04:00.670 --> 01:04:00.680 align:start position:0%
Senate HB 1633 is something that
 
01:04:02.349 --> 01:04:02.359 align:start position:0%
everybody in this body should be proud
 
01:04:04.349 --> 01:04:04.359 align:start position:0%
of it's something that people on both
 
01:04:06.829 --> 01:04:06.839 align:start position:0%
sides of the aisle many stakeholders
 
01:04:08.309 --> 01:04:08.319 align:start position:0%
worked together to come up with
 
01:04:11.470 --> 01:04:11.480 align:start position:0%
compromise and acted in good faith I
 
01:04:13.789 --> 01:04:13.799 align:start position:0%
myself worked with my friend from Derry
 
01:04:15.630 --> 01:04:15.640 align:start position:0%
multiple times had multiple lunches
 
01:04:17.269 --> 01:04:17.279 align:start position:0%
talking about different concerns as we
 
01:04:19.589 --> 01:04:19.599 align:start position:0%
worked through this bill throughout this
 
01:04:22.190 --> 01:04:22.200 align:start position:0%
process this is an great example that
 
01:04:24.309 --> 01:04:24.319 align:start position:0%
this body can be proud of of passing a
 
01:04:26.589 --> 01:04:26.599 align:start position:0%
strong bipartisan bill
 
01:04:29.069 --> 01:04:29.079 align:start position:0%
that was done in good faith to solve
 
01:04:30.390 --> 01:04:30.400 align:start position:0%
problems that the majority of the people
 
01:04:32.430 --> 01:04:32.440 align:start position:0%
in this state want solved that's the
 
01:04:33.990 --> 01:04:34.000 align:start position:0%
type of government that we were hired
 
01:04:36.510 --> 01:04:36.520 align:start position:0%
and sent here to do
 
01:04:38.510 --> 01:04:38.520 align:start position:0%
unfortunately the members on the other
 
01:04:41.150 --> 01:04:41.160 align:start position:0%
body decided to gut all of that good
 
01:04:43.269 --> 01:04:43.279 align:start position:0%
work and replace it with what is
 
01:04:47.510 --> 01:04:47.520 align:start position:0%
objectively a deeply flawed profoundly
 
01:04:49.190 --> 01:04:49.200 align:start position:0%
bad bill when it comes to the goal of
 
01:04:52.309 --> 01:04:52.319 align:start position:0%
legalizing cannabis sales in New
 
01:04:54.630 --> 01:04:54.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the benefits of
 
01:04:56.510 --> 01:04:56.520 align:start position:0%
legalization are
 
01:04:59.069 --> 01:04:59.079 align:start position:0%
many we hear people talk about Revenue
 
01:05:02.309 --> 01:05:02.319 align:start position:0%
increases we hear about um allowing
 
01:05:05.029 --> 01:05:05.039 align:start position:0%
people more freedom civil liberties but
 
01:05:07.230 --> 01:05:07.240 align:start position:0%
the most important one for me standing
 
01:05:09.950 --> 01:05:09.960 align:start position:0%
here today is to stop arresting people
 
01:05:11.269 --> 01:05:11.279 align:start position:0%
for things that by and large the
 
01:05:13.349 --> 01:05:13.359 align:start position:0%
majority in society no longer view as
 
01:05:14.870 --> 01:05:14.880 align:start position:0%
something particularly serious that need
 
01:05:17.470 --> 01:05:17.480 align:start position:0%
to ruin people's lives through through
 
01:05:20.230 --> 01:05:20.240 align:start position:0%
arresting while this does theoretically
 
01:05:23.670 --> 01:05:23.680 align:start position:0%
do that it doesn't do it until
 
01:05:26.190 --> 01:05:26.200 align:start position:0%
2026 which is kind of saying that we
 
01:05:28.390 --> 01:05:28.400 align:start position:0%
would sign a bill that then it doesn't
 
01:05:30.750 --> 01:05:30.760 align:start position:0%
do the most important part of it for
 
01:05:33.190 --> 01:05:33.200 align:start position:0%
over a year we could come back next year
 
01:05:34.630 --> 01:05:34.640 align:start position:0%
and pass a bill that could do it six
 
01:05:36.910 --> 01:05:36.920 align:start position:0%
months earlier than if we pass this bill
 
01:05:39.589 --> 01:05:39.599 align:start position:0%
today second if you're concerned about
 
01:05:41.109 --> 01:05:41.119 align:start position:0%
civil liberties are you really
 
01:05:43.789 --> 01:05:43.799 align:start position:0%
comfortable with the idea of growing the
 
01:05:47.309 --> 01:05:47.319 align:start position:0%
The Liquor Commission into a new police
 
01:05:48.950 --> 01:05:48.960 align:start position:0%
organization that can come into your
 
01:05:50.910 --> 01:05:50.920 align:start position:0%
home because home grow is not allowed
 
01:05:52.870 --> 01:05:52.880 align:start position:0%
and supervise what you're doing there
 
01:05:55.390 --> 01:05:55.400 align:start position:0%
and actually bust people who potentially
 
01:05:58.670 --> 01:05:58.680 align:start position:0%
have a few homeg grow plants going on
 
01:06:00.950 --> 01:06:00.960 align:start position:0%
and and it also criminalizes behavior
 
01:06:03.309 --> 01:06:03.319 align:start position:0%
that is currently legal in New Hampshire
 
01:06:04.750 --> 01:06:04.760 align:start position:0%
yes let me say that again for those of
 
01:06:06.430 --> 01:06:06.440 align:start position:0%
you who didn't hear it the first time
 
01:06:08.510 --> 01:06:08.520 align:start position:0%
there are behaviors in this state right
 
01:06:10.710 --> 01:06:10.720 align:start position:0%
now that are currently legal for example
 
01:06:12.190 --> 01:06:12.200 align:start position:0%
if you have a medical card and you
 
01:06:14.309 --> 01:06:14.319 align:start position:0%
consume a gummy and you are riding in a
 
01:06:16.630 --> 01:06:16.640 align:start position:0%
car that is acceptable that will become
 
01:06:18.789 --> 01:06:18.799 align:start position:0%
illegal under this new bill if it
 
01:06:21.069 --> 01:06:21.079 align:start position:0%
becomes law this should concern
 
01:06:22.549 --> 01:06:22.559 align:start position:0%
everybody who concerns about who is
 
01:06:24.789 --> 01:06:24.799 align:start position:0%
concerned about civil liberties as I am
 
01:06:27.470 --> 01:06:27.480 align:start position:0%
we can do better than
 
01:06:27.480 --> 01:06:29.470 align:start position:0%
we can do better than
this

01:06:29.470 --> 01:06:29.480 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:06:32.390 --> 01:06:32.400 align:start position:0%
second the second big thing is is is
 
01:06:35.230 --> 01:06:35.240 align:start position:0%
revenue in in scope this I just talked
 
01:06:39.390 --> 01:06:39.400 align:start position:0%
about legalization but this is a 36 page
 
01:06:41.950 --> 01:06:41.960 align:start position:0%
bill of which only a few lines talk
 
01:06:44.230 --> 01:06:44.240 align:start position:0%
about legalization the rest of the
 
01:06:46.390 --> 01:06:46.400 align:start position:0%
language goes to the structure of how
 
01:06:48.870 --> 01:06:48.880 align:start position:0%
we're going to sell marijuana and that
 
01:06:52.230 --> 01:06:52.240 align:start position:0%
structure is really bad like really bad
 
01:06:54.430 --> 01:06:54.440 align:start position:0%
honestly it doesn't consider small
 
01:06:55.829 --> 01:06:55.839 align:start position:0%
businesses it doesn't consider the
 
01:06:57.309 --> 01:06:57.319 align:start position:0%
businesses that are already operating
 
01:06:59.150 --> 01:06:59.160 align:start position:0%
under the medical system that we
 
01:07:02.910 --> 01:07:02.920 align:start position:0%
currently have it will give a franchise
 
01:07:05.750 --> 01:07:05.760 align:start position:0%
model run by the state which despite
 
01:07:09.069 --> 01:07:09.079 align:start position:0%
what supporters say does put the state
 
01:07:10.789 --> 01:07:10.799 align:start position:0%
at risk because it is still illegal
 
01:07:12.549 --> 01:07:12.559 align:start position:0%
federally so if this if we have a
 
01:07:14.470 --> 01:07:14.480 align:start position:0%
different administration at the federal
 
01:07:15.950 --> 01:07:15.960 align:start position:0%
level that wants to crack down on
 
01:07:18.829 --> 01:07:18.839 align:start position:0%
marijuana sales New Hampshire as a state
 
01:07:22.069 --> 01:07:22.079 align:start position:0%
will be at some level potentially liable
 
01:07:24.430 --> 01:07:24.440 align:start position:0%
being being the franchise or renting it
 
01:07:26.789 --> 01:07:26.799 align:start position:0%
out to franchisees also puts a state at
 
01:07:28.829 --> 01:07:28.839 align:start position:0%
risk because think about it if you go in
 
01:07:30.470 --> 01:07:30.480 align:start position:0%
with McDonald's and something happens to
 
01:07:32.309 --> 01:07:32.319 align:start position:0%
you you don't just Sue that that
 
01:07:34.710 --> 01:07:34.720 align:start position:0%
franchisee you you sue McDonald's as
 
01:07:37.750 --> 01:07:37.760 align:start position:0%
well New Hampshire is the McDonald's in
 
01:07:39.349 --> 01:07:39.359 align:start position:0%
this scenario they're not just the
 
01:07:43.430 --> 01:07:43.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:45.990 --> 01:07:46.000 align:start position:0%
risk I personally have I've been up here
 
01:07:47.630 --> 01:07:47.640 align:start position:0%
and spoken every time I've come up here
 
01:07:50.109 --> 01:07:50.119 align:start position:0%
I've spoken on bills that are generally
 
01:07:52.829 --> 01:07:52.839 align:start position:0%
pro- free market pro- free enterprise
 
01:07:54.789 --> 01:07:54.799 align:start position:0%
this build does the opposite this
 
01:07:57.589 --> 01:07:57.599 align:start position:0%
expands government it take allows
 
01:07:59.750 --> 01:07:59.760 align:start position:0%
government to take full entire control
 
01:08:02.390 --> 01:08:02.400 align:start position:0%
of an entire new industry taking away
 
01:08:05.309 --> 01:08:05.319 align:start position:0%
the ability of free enterprise to allow
 
01:08:08.870 --> 01:08:08.880 align:start position:0%
for innovation in a new industry
 
01:08:10.349 --> 01:08:10.359 align:start position:0%
Innovation is going to be key because we
 
01:08:11.309 --> 01:08:11.319 align:start position:0%
don't know what this is going to look
 
01:08:13.910 --> 01:08:13.920 align:start position:0%
like in 20 years from now what I do know
 
01:08:15.589 --> 01:08:15.599 align:start position:0%
is that if the if the government is the
 
01:08:17.709 --> 01:08:17.719 align:start position:0%
one calling the shots and running it
 
01:08:19.030 --> 01:08:19.040 align:start position:0%
they're not going to be the ones at the
 
01:08:22.030 --> 01:08:22.040 align:start position:0%
Forefront of innovation because when is
 
01:08:23.630 --> 01:08:23.640 align:start position:0%
the government the one at the Forefront
 
01:08:25.229 --> 01:08:25.239 align:start position:0%
of innovation like I think the majority
 
01:08:28.470 --> 01:08:28.480 align:start position:0%
of in here can agree I urge everybody in
 
01:08:31.149 --> 01:08:31.159 align:start position:0%
this body who's concerned about this
 
01:08:33.709 --> 01:08:33.719 align:start position:0%
bill and who really does in good faith
 
01:08:36.149 --> 01:08:36.159 align:start position:0%
want to legalize cannabis consumption
 
01:08:38.870 --> 01:08:38.880 align:start position:0%
and sales in the state to vote non-c
 
01:08:40.430 --> 01:08:40.440 align:start position:0%
concur to vote against this motion to
 
01:08:43.430 --> 01:08:43.440 align:start position:0%
concur because we can do better and we
 
01:08:45.189 --> 01:08:45.199 align:start position:0%
should do better and the idea that this
 
01:08:47.870 --> 01:08:47.880 align:start position:0%
we can somehow fix this deeply deeply
 
01:08:50.630 --> 01:08:50.640 align:start position:0%
flawed Bill suggest that we acknowledge
 
01:08:53.030 --> 01:08:53.040 align:start position:0%
it's deeply deeply flawed and we can
 
01:08:55.829 --> 01:08:55.839 align:start position:0%
somehow fix it next year despite
 
01:08:57.309 --> 01:08:57.319 align:start position:0%
whatever whoever is serving in the
 
01:08:58.910 --> 01:08:58.920 align:start position:0%
corner office or serving on the other
 
01:09:00.950 --> 01:09:00.960 align:start position:0%
side of this wall if you can't pass a
 
01:09:02.630 --> 01:09:02.640 align:start position:0%
good bill next year we probably are not
 
01:09:04.870 --> 01:09:04.880 align:start position:0%
going to be able to pass improvements to
 
01:09:07.950 --> 01:09:07.960 align:start position:0%
this deeply flawed bill please join me
 
01:09:09.990 --> 01:09:10.000 align:start position:0%
in voting against this motion to concur
 
01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:10.870 align:start position:0%
in voting against this motion to concur
thank

01:09:10.870 --> 01:09:10.880 align:start position:0%
thank
 
01:09:18.550 --> 01:09:18.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:21.749 --> 01:09:21.759 align:start position:0%
verville thank you Mr speaker thank you
 
01:09:24.110 --> 01:09:24.120 align:start position:0%
colleagues so I don't think it's any
 
01:09:26.309 --> 01:09:26.319 align:start position:0%
Secret in this room
 
01:09:28.550 --> 01:09:28.560 align:start position:0%
I am staunchly in
 
01:09:32.669 --> 01:09:32.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:35.430 --> 01:09:35.440 align:start position:0%
decriminalization and I've held that
 
01:09:39.189 --> 01:09:39.199 align:start position:0%
position since a teenager so in 40 some
 
01:09:42.189 --> 01:09:42.199 align:start position:0%
odd years that position has not wavered
 
01:09:42.199 --> 01:09:43.709 align:start position:0%
odd years that position has not wavered
for

01:09:43.709 --> 01:09:43.719 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:09:47.070 --> 01:09:47.080 align:start position:0%
me but this is not the New Hampshire
 
01:09:50.149 --> 01:09:50.159 align:start position:0%
solution this bill is not what we're
 
01:09:50.159 --> 01:09:51.309 align:start position:0%
solution this bill is not what we're
looking

01:09:51.309 --> 01:09:51.319 align:start position:0%
looking
 
01:09:55.630 --> 01:09:55.640 align:start position:0%
for and what I hear from proponents
 
01:09:58.669 --> 01:09:58.679 align:start position:0%
is this drummed up sense of
 
01:10:01.430 --> 01:10:01.440 align:start position:0%
urgency that we have to do something we
 
01:10:03.669 --> 01:10:03.679 align:start position:0%
have to do something now if we don't do
 
01:10:07.709 --> 01:10:07.719 align:start position:0%
something now then who knows when we're
 
01:10:12.030 --> 01:10:12.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:14.149 --> 01:10:14.159 align:start position:0%
something who knows who knows when we
 
01:10:16.030 --> 01:10:16.040 align:start position:0%
won't be able to do
 
01:10:20.149 --> 01:10:20.159 align:start position:0%
something I do not subscribe to the
 
01:10:22.709 --> 01:10:22.719 align:start position:0%
premise that something is better than
 
01:10:24.669 --> 01:10:24.679 align:start position:0%
nothing we have to do something doing
 
01:10:26.630 --> 01:10:26.640 align:start position:0%
something is better than doing nothing
 
01:10:29.870 --> 01:10:29.880 align:start position:0%
not in this casee not in this case in
 
01:10:32.390 --> 01:10:32.400 align:start position:0%
this case doing something is worse than
 
01:10:34.229 --> 01:10:34.239 align:start position:0%
the status quo and that's why I'm going
 
01:10:36.149 --> 01:10:36.159 align:start position:0%
to vote against the motion of
 
01:10:39.070 --> 01:10:39.080 align:start position:0%
concurrence on this on this
 
01:10:42.350 --> 01:10:42.360 align:start position:0%
bill as the previous speaker said this
 
01:10:47.470 --> 01:10:47.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:50.110 --> 01:10:50.120 align:start position:0%
government and and stop me if you've
 
01:10:52.110 --> 01:10:52.120 align:start position:0%
stop me if you've heard this one before
 
01:10:52.120 --> 01:10:53.790 align:start position:0%
stop me if you've heard this one before
Mr

01:10:53.790 --> 01:10:53.800 align:start position:0%
Mr
 
01:10:55.910 --> 01:10:55.920 align:start position:0%
Speaker pass it
 
01:10:59.709 --> 01:10:59.719 align:start position:0%
today and we'll fix it
 
01:11:03.310 --> 01:11:03.320 align:start position:0%
later I never hear
 
01:11:05.590 --> 01:11:05.600 align:start position:0%
anything thank you Mr
 
01:11:08.590 --> 01:11:08.600 align:start position:0%
Speaker I've served in this body for
 
01:11:08.600 --> 01:11:09.550 align:start position:0%
Speaker I've served in this body for
eight

01:11:09.550 --> 01:11:09.560 align:start position:0%
eight
 
01:11:11.910 --> 01:11:11.920 align:start position:0%
years eight
 
01:11:16.310 --> 01:11:16.320 align:start position:0%
years how many things did we come back
 
01:11:19.270 --> 01:11:19.280 align:start position:0%
and fix later in the course of my 8
 
01:11:20.470 --> 01:11:20.480 align:start position:0%
years of
 
01:11:23.229 --> 01:11:23.239 align:start position:0%
service and I asked I asked colleagues
 
01:11:24.510 --> 01:11:24.520 align:start position:0%
this morning you know we're Milling
 
01:11:26.709 --> 01:11:26.719 align:start position:0%
around Chi chatting fix it
 
01:11:29.510 --> 01:11:29.520 align:start position:0%
later and nobody could give me an
 
01:11:32.750 --> 01:11:32.760 align:start position:0%
example of something that we fixed later
 
01:11:35.030 --> 01:11:35.040 align:start position:0%
so fix later is is for me as a
 
01:11:37.669 --> 01:11:37.679 align:start position:0%
non-starter it will not be fixed later
 
01:11:40.790 --> 01:11:40.800 align:start position:0%
this this sort of mirrors our Spirits
 
01:11:43.870 --> 01:11:43.880 align:start position:0%
laws our liquor laws our liquor laws
 
01:11:47.350 --> 01:11:47.360 align:start position:0%
were passed shortly after the repeal of
 
01:11:50.270 --> 01:11:50.280 align:start position:0%
prohibition and they've basically uh
 
01:11:53.149 --> 01:11:53.159 align:start position:0%
remained more abound since then so what
 
01:11:57.070 --> 01:11:57.080 align:start position:0%
100 years give or take and so if we pass
 
01:11:59.550 --> 01:11:59.560 align:start position:0%
this today you're looking at at a 100
 
01:12:02.189 --> 01:12:02.199 align:start position:0%
years of this being
 
01:12:05.350 --> 01:12:05.360 align:start position:0%
law I'm not looking forward to
 
01:12:08.590 --> 01:12:08.600 align:start position:0%
that if I'm lucky enough to get
 
01:12:11.189 --> 01:12:11.199 align:start position:0%
reelected I'm going to come in with a
 
01:12:15.629 --> 01:12:15.639 align:start position:0%
slew of um peac meal repeal bills that I
 
01:12:18.430 --> 01:12:18.440 align:start position:0%
don't think most of you want to spend
 
01:12:22.030 --> 01:12:22.040 align:start position:0%
time listening to the opponents as to
 
01:12:24.030 --> 01:12:24.040 align:start position:0%
why these are bad ideas to try and fix
 
01:12:27.270 --> 01:12:27.280 align:start position:0%
it even though it won't get won't get
 
01:12:31.470 --> 01:12:31.480 align:start position:0%
fixed this bill is big pot the only
 
01:12:34.270 --> 01:12:34.280 align:start position:0%
Communications that I got in favor of
 
01:12:38.229 --> 01:12:38.239 align:start position:0%
this bill was from by was from big pot
 
01:12:41.350 --> 01:12:41.360 align:start position:0%
big pot loves this bill and if I was big
 
01:12:43.390 --> 01:12:43.400 align:start position:0%
pot I would love this bill too but I'm
 
01:12:45.189 --> 01:12:45.199 align:start position:0%
not big pot I'm little
 
01:12:48.750 --> 01:12:48.760 align:start position:0%
pot and little pot is Mom and Pops and
 
01:12:51.870 --> 01:12:51.880 align:start position:0%
there's no Mom and Pops in this this is
 
01:12:53.990 --> 01:12:54.000 align:start position:0%
not free market this is Government
 
01:12:56.149 --> 01:12:56.159 align:start position:0%
monopoly the government has been telling
 
01:13:00.229 --> 01:13:00.239 align:start position:0%
me if you do that and I catch you I will
 
01:13:03.189 --> 01:13:03.199 align:start position:0%
prosecute you I will find you and I will
 
01:13:05.669 --> 01:13:05.679 align:start position:0%
try to throw you in
 
01:13:08.270 --> 01:13:08.280 align:start position:0%
jail and now all of a sudden the state
 
01:13:10.229 --> 01:13:10.239 align:start position:0%
wants to be the pot
 
01:13:13.590 --> 01:13:13.600 align:start position:0%
dealer for almost eight years from
 
01:13:16.030 --> 01:13:16.040 align:start position:0%
another section of this building we've
 
01:13:18.350 --> 01:13:18.360 align:start position:0%
heard how legalized cannabis is not
 
01:13:20.149 --> 01:13:20.159 align:start position:0%
right for New Hampshire it is not right
 
01:13:22.070 --> 01:13:22.080 align:start position:0%
for New Hampshire children it is not
 
01:13:23.629 --> 01:13:23.639 align:start position:0%
right for New Hampshire families it is
 
01:13:25.550 --> 01:13:25.560 align:start position:0%
not right for New Hampshire well I
 
01:13:27.270 --> 01:13:27.280 align:start position:0%
disagree with that except for the part
 
01:13:30.030 --> 01:13:30.040 align:start position:0%
for the children all of a sudden there's
 
01:13:32.310 --> 01:13:32.320 align:start position:0%
a there's a change of heart over there
 
01:13:35.030 --> 01:13:35.040 align:start position:0%
in the in the corner of the
 
01:13:37.189 --> 01:13:37.199 align:start position:0%
building that doesn't move me that
 
01:13:39.510 --> 01:13:39.520 align:start position:0%
doesn't make this better it doesn't give
 
01:13:42.350 --> 01:13:42.360 align:start position:0%
me a sense of urgency so I ask you uh
 
01:13:44.430 --> 01:13:44.440 align:start position:0%
again to to to vote no there's no
 
01:13:47.229 --> 01:13:47.239 align:start position:0%
homegrown in
 
01:13:49.709 --> 01:13:49.719 align:start position:0%
this you want to you want to hear the
 
01:13:52.750 --> 01:13:52.760 align:start position:0%
worst part right is I know I know the
 
01:13:54.590 --> 01:13:54.600 align:start position:0%
vast majority of my constituents want
 
01:13:56.669 --> 01:13:56.679 align:start position:0%
legal cannabis and they want it in New
 
01:13:58.070 --> 01:13:58.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and they want it sooner than
 
01:14:00.350 --> 01:14:00.360 align:start position:0%
later but this is not the right solution
 
01:14:02.910 --> 01:14:02.920 align:start position:0%
for us for that reason I'm asking you to
 
01:14:04.990 --> 01:14:05.000 align:start position:0%
press the red button on
 
01:14:07.950 --> 01:14:07.960 align:start position:0%
concurrence so that a motion of non-c
 
01:14:10.350 --> 01:14:10.360 align:start position:0%
concurrence can be made so that we can
 
01:14:12.750 --> 01:14:12.760 align:start position:0%
just dispose of this nonsense and move
 
01:14:15.590 --> 01:14:15.600 align:start position:0%
on with the business of to of today and
 
01:14:18.229 --> 01:14:18.239 align:start position:0%
try again next year thank you Mr Speaker
 
01:14:27.790 --> 01:14:27.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:29.470 --> 01:14:29.480 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr
 
01:14:31.910 --> 01:14:31.920 align:start position:0%
Speaker this bill accomplishes my major
 
01:14:33.669 --> 01:14:33.679 align:start position:0%
goals for cus
 
01:14:35.550 --> 01:14:35.560 align:start position:0%
legalization I share many of the
 
01:14:37.229 --> 01:14:37.239 align:start position:0%
concerns others have voiced about the
 
01:14:38.470 --> 01:14:38.480 align:start position:0%
market it
 
01:14:40.510 --> 01:14:40.520 align:start position:0%
creates however the system it creates
 
01:14:42.470 --> 01:14:42.480 align:start position:0%
will either work and be better than
 
01:14:45.270 --> 01:14:45.280 align:start position:0%
driving to any of our neighbors or I
 
01:14:46.790 --> 01:14:46.800 align:start position:0%
have confidence there will be the
 
01:14:48.750 --> 01:14:48.760 align:start position:0%
political will to fix it in the fut in a
 
01:14:51.950 --> 01:14:51.960 align:start position:0%
future term but legalization will never
 
01:14:53.709 --> 01:14:53.719 align:start position:0%
be repealed once
 
01:14:55.910 --> 01:14:55.920 align:start position:0%
pasted please please join me in pressing
 
01:14:57.629 --> 01:14:57.639 align:start position:0%
the green button and make New Hampshire
 
01:15:01.310 --> 01:15:01.320 align:start position:0%
the 25th state to legalize weed and
 
01:15:03.669 --> 01:15:03.679 align:start position:0%
change the national discussion thank you
 
01:15:11.910 --> 01:15:11.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:13.950 --> 01:15:13.960 align:start position:0%
Howard thank you Mr Speaker and
 
01:15:13.960 --> 01:15:15.189 align:start position:0%
Howard thank you Mr Speaker and
honorable

01:15:15.189 --> 01:15:15.199 align:start position:0%
honorable
 
01:15:17.270 --> 01:15:17.280 align:start position:0%
Representatives uh today I'm speaking
 
01:15:19.990 --> 01:15:20.000 align:start position:0%
against concurrence of HB
 
01:15:22.750 --> 01:15:22.760 align:start position:0%
1633 and if you know me that's kind of a
 
01:15:24.990 --> 01:15:25.000 align:start position:0%
surprise because I'm a big supporter of
 
01:15:27.189 --> 01:15:27.199 align:start position:0%
cannabis legalization and I myself am
 
01:15:29.830 --> 01:15:29.840 align:start position:0%
also a medical patient in fact this
 
01:15:32.149 --> 01:15:32.159 align:start position:0%
cycle I submitted five Pro cannabis
 
01:15:34.629 --> 01:15:34.639 align:start position:0%
bills however the bill in front of us
 
01:15:34.639 --> 01:15:36.550 align:start position:0%
bills however the bill in front of us
today

01:15:36.550 --> 01:15:36.560 align:start position:0%
today
 
01:15:39.430 --> 01:15:39.440 align:start position:0%
is regarding cannabis legalization is
 
01:15:41.790 --> 01:15:41.800 align:start position:0%
extremely flawed and it's not what's
 
01:15:43.310 --> 01:15:43.320 align:start position:0%
best for the people of New Hampshire
 
01:15:45.189 --> 01:15:45.199 align:start position:0%
because it throws medical patients
 
01:15:47.189 --> 01:15:47.199 align:start position:0%
alternative treatment centers and
 
01:15:49.629 --> 01:15:49.639 align:start position:0%
recreational users under the bus instead
 
01:15:51.550 --> 01:15:51.560 align:start position:0%
of building on the success of our
 
01:15:53.510 --> 01:15:53.520 align:start position:0%
state's successful therapeutic cannabis
 
01:15:56.350 --> 01:15:56.360 align:start position:0%
program this bill would
 
01:15:59.510 --> 01:15:59.520 align:start position:0%
completely separate the two systems uh
 
01:16:01.669 --> 01:16:01.679 align:start position:0%
that would put our current system in
 
01:16:05.110 --> 01:16:05.120 align:start position:0%
serious Jeopardy in addition potential
 
01:16:06.870 --> 01:16:06.880 align:start position:0%
harming uh the to the potential harming
 
01:16:09.270 --> 01:16:09.280 align:start position:0%
of patients ability to access adequate
 
01:16:12.030 --> 01:16:12.040 align:start position:0%
care this bill also creates two new
 
01:16:14.149 --> 01:16:14.159 align:start position:0%
Criminal penalties one for second
 
01:16:17.669 --> 01:16:17.679 align:start position:0%
offense public smoking or vaping and one
 
01:16:20.629 --> 01:16:20.639 align:start position:0%
for consuming in Motor Vehicles even if
 
01:16:21.550 --> 01:16:21.560 align:start position:0%
you're a
 
01:16:24.229 --> 01:16:24.239 align:start position:0%
passenger we know that cannabis laws
 
01:16:26.510 --> 01:16:26.520 align:start position:0%
have been dis proportionately enforced
 
01:16:29.510 --> 01:16:29.520 align:start position:0%
against marginalized communities so we
 
01:16:31.750 --> 01:16:31.760 align:start position:0%
ought to recognize that these new
 
01:16:33.310 --> 01:16:33.320 align:start position:0%
Criminal penalties would be
 
01:16:35.430 --> 01:16:35.440 align:start position:0%
disproportionately enforced as
 
01:16:38.310 --> 01:16:38.320 align:start position:0%
well but let's focus for a moment on the
 
01:16:40.430 --> 01:16:40.440 align:start position:0%
alternative treatment centers and our
 
01:16:42.990 --> 01:16:43.000 align:start position:0%
our therapeutic cannabis program I've
 
01:16:44.790 --> 01:16:44.800 align:start position:0%
been to dispensaries in other New
 
01:16:47.110 --> 01:16:47.120 align:start position:0%
England states and there's one huge
 
01:16:49.310 --> 01:16:49.320 align:start position:0%
difference between New Hampshire and the
 
01:16:52.629 --> 01:16:52.639 align:start position:0%
others it is the educational services
 
01:16:57.070 --> 01:16:57.080 align:start position:0%
available at each dispensary in New
 
01:16:59.590 --> 01:16:59.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire in New Hampshire you can walk
 
01:17:02.430 --> 01:17:02.440 align:start position:0%
right in and have a far more in-depth
 
01:17:04.270 --> 01:17:04.280 align:start position:0%
level of patient care that is not
 
01:17:06.110 --> 01:17:06.120 align:start position:0%
matched by other states and you can
 
01:17:08.310 --> 01:17:08.320 align:start position:0%
easily see this by walking into any
 
01:17:11.870 --> 01:17:11.880 align:start position:0%
dispensary as I said before you are even
 
01:17:14.350 --> 01:17:14.360 align:start position:0%
able to see cannabis you are given
 
01:17:16.870 --> 01:17:16.880 align:start position:0%
several forms to assess each patient's
 
01:17:19.189 --> 01:17:19.199 align:start position:0%
needs and there are always experts
 
01:17:21.030 --> 01:17:21.040 align:start position:0%
available for a one-on-one
 
01:17:23.110 --> 01:17:23.120 align:start position:0%
consultation I've been to other states
 
01:17:27.149 --> 01:17:27.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:29.149 --> 01:17:29.159 align:start position:0%
this provides not only great resources
 
01:17:31.430 --> 01:17:31.440 align:start position:0%
to new patients but is a great harm
 
01:17:33.870 --> 01:17:33.880 align:start position:0%
reduction method as well because we can
 
01:17:36.950 --> 01:17:36.960 align:start position:0%
actually educate patients and users as
 
01:17:41.390 --> 01:17:41.400 align:start position:0%
to how to properly use cannabis without
 
01:17:45.070 --> 01:17:45.080 align:start position:0%
creating a situation for
 
01:17:48.910 --> 01:17:48.920 align:start position:0%
abuse this the bill before us today
 
01:17:51.870 --> 01:17:51.880 align:start position:0%
envisions a franchise retail store that
 
01:17:53.750 --> 01:17:53.760 align:start position:0%
could sell therapeutic cannabis products
 
01:17:55.790 --> 01:17:55.800 align:start position:0%
to patients but without anywhere near
 
01:17:57.149 --> 01:17:57.159 align:start position:0%
the same level of
 
01:18:00.750 --> 01:18:00.760 align:start position:0%
education and with a 15% tax slapped up
 
01:18:03.189 --> 01:18:03.199 align:start position:0%
on top of that this is insulting to
 
01:18:06.950 --> 01:18:06.960 align:start position:0%
patients like myself who if you go to
 
01:18:11.590 --> 01:18:11.600 align:start position:0%
other states pay less or pay no tax on
 
01:18:14.110 --> 01:18:14.120 align:start position:0%
top of that New Hampshire doesn't tax
 
01:18:15.990 --> 01:18:16.000 align:start position:0%
other medications so why do we think
 
01:18:18.110 --> 01:18:18.120 align:start position:0%
it's okay to tax therapeutic cannabis
 
01:18:20.149 --> 01:18:20.159 align:start position:0%
are we trying to delegitimize the needs
 
01:18:22.070 --> 01:18:22.080 align:start position:0%
of real patients and eliminate
 
01:18:23.950 --> 01:18:23.960 align:start position:0%
incentives for people to register for
 
01:18:26.629 --> 01:18:26.639 align:start position:0%
the therapeutic cannabis program we know
 
01:18:30.149 --> 01:18:30.159 align:start position:0%
other states uh that have had medical
 
01:18:31.550 --> 01:18:31.560 align:start position:0%
programs where they introduced
 
01:18:34.550 --> 01:18:34.560 align:start position:0%
recreational uh programs that
 
01:18:36.629 --> 01:18:36.639 align:start position:0%
participation in the medical cannabis
 
01:18:39.350 --> 01:18:39.360 align:start position:0%
programs declined
 
01:18:41.669 --> 01:18:41.679 align:start position:0%
drastically the same thing will happen
 
01:18:43.950 --> 01:18:43.960 align:start position:0%
here especially if we don't exemp
 
01:18:46.629 --> 01:18:46.639 align:start position:0%
patients from the 15% tax and we
 
01:18:48.910 --> 01:18:48.920 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be surprised if our medical
 
01:18:50.950 --> 01:18:50.960 align:start position:0%
dispensaries uh are medical only
 
01:18:52.590 --> 01:18:52.600 align:start position:0%
dispensaries are forced to close their
 
01:18:54.990 --> 01:18:55.000 align:start position:0%
doors within a few years this this would
 
01:18:57.270 --> 01:18:57.280 align:start position:0%
be terrible for patients and it
 
01:18:59.310 --> 01:18:59.320 align:start position:0%
certainly wouldn't be consistent with
 
01:19:01.910 --> 01:19:01.920 align:start position:0%
the harm reduction approach to
 
01:19:04.110 --> 01:19:04.120 align:start position:0%
legalization Most states that legalize
 
01:19:06.510 --> 01:19:06.520 align:start position:0%
cannabis have seen fit to integrate
 
01:19:08.990 --> 01:19:09.000 align:start position:0%
their existing medical programs with
 
01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:10.149 align:start position:0%
their existing medical programs with
adult

01:19:10.149 --> 01:19:10.159 align:start position:0%
adult
 
01:19:13.270 --> 01:19:13.280 align:start position:0%
use improving access for patients while
 
01:19:16.350 --> 01:19:16.360 align:start position:0%
creating legal access for non-patients
 
01:19:19.229 --> 01:19:19.239 align:start position:0%
dual use retail stores serve both types
 
01:19:21.709 --> 01:19:21.719 align:start position:0%
of customers and are common in other
 
01:19:24.110 --> 01:19:24.120 align:start position:0%
states but they would be prohibited
 
01:19:27.270 --> 01:19:27.280 align:start position:0%
under this bill Bill instead the bill
 
01:19:29.830 --> 01:19:29.840 align:start position:0%
would give the same preference to any
 
01:19:32.550 --> 01:19:32.560 align:start position:0%
cannabis business regardless of where
 
01:19:35.030 --> 01:19:35.040 align:start position:0%
they are coming from so businesses that
 
01:19:36.870 --> 01:19:36.880 align:start position:0%
have been here in New Hampshire are not
 
01:19:39.709 --> 01:19:39.719 align:start position:0%
going to be considered uh as a major
 
01:19:42.870 --> 01:19:42.880 align:start position:0%
criteria for licensing the other chamber
 
01:19:46.189 --> 01:19:46.199 align:start position:0%
removed that uh and as a result this
 
01:19:49.350 --> 01:19:49.360 align:start position:0%
current bill uh seems to be intended to
 
01:19:50.830 --> 01:19:50.840 align:start position:0%
exclude the alternative treatment
 
01:19:54.310 --> 01:19:54.320 align:start position:0%
centers from being able to become dual
 
01:20:01.189 --> 01:20:01.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:03.550 --> 01:20:03.560 align:start position:0%
facility I think we need to be focusing
 
01:20:05.350 --> 01:20:05.360 align:start position:0%
on keeping the existing companies who've
 
01:20:07.310 --> 01:20:07.320 align:start position:0%
been operating employing and serving
 
01:20:09.910 --> 01:20:09.920 align:start position:0%
Granite State Staters for seven years a
 
01:20:11.950 --> 01:20:11.960 align:start position:0%
single retail license which is all the
 
01:20:15.189 --> 01:20:15.199 align:start position:0%
atcs have been asking for and before
 
01:20:17.510 --> 01:20:17.520 align:start position:0%
giving away these licenses to Big
 
01:20:19.910 --> 01:20:19.920 align:start position:0%
cannabis companies
 
01:20:23.030 --> 01:20:23.040 align:start position:0%
DHHS has stated that the atc's are an
 
01:20:25.149 --> 01:20:25.159 align:start position:0%
essential partner in providing care to
 
01:20:27.430 --> 01:20:27.440 align:start position:0%
the 15,000 plus patients currently in
 
01:20:29.950 --> 01:20:29.960 align:start position:0%
the program these companies employ over
 
01:20:32.790 --> 01:20:32.800 align:start position:0%
a 100 granite sters and we should
 
01:20:34.669 --> 01:20:34.679 align:start position:0%
include them in the future of New
 
01:20:37.830 --> 01:20:37.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire cannabis not shut them out
 
01:20:39.870 --> 01:20:39.880 align:start position:0%
recreational consumers are also going to
 
01:20:42.030 --> 01:20:42.040 align:start position:0%
get a bad deal too because New Hampshire
 
01:20:43.830 --> 01:20:43.840 align:start position:0%
is surrounded in all directions by
 
01:20:46.070 --> 01:20:46.080 align:start position:0%
states with flourishing cannabis markets
 
01:20:48.030 --> 01:20:48.040 align:start position:0%
does anybody really believe that this
 
01:20:50.510 --> 01:20:50.520 align:start position:0%
state controlled franchise approach will
 
01:20:52.790 --> 01:20:52.800 align:start position:0%
serve consumers better than craft
 
01:20:54.149 --> 01:20:54.159 align:start position:0%
cannabis markets that have been
 
01:20:56.790 --> 01:20:56.800 align:start position:0%
developing in other states our state as
 
01:21:00.510 --> 01:21:00.520 align:start position:0%
I said would have a higher tax rate than
 
01:21:03.030 --> 01:21:03.040 align:start position:0%
all of our neighbors which is the exact
 
01:21:05.030 --> 01:21:05.040 align:start position:0%
opposite strategy that we use for our
 
01:21:05.040 --> 01:21:05.910 align:start position:0%
opposite strategy that we use for our
liquor

01:21:05.910 --> 01:21:05.920 align:start position:0%
liquor
 
01:21:08.990 --> 01:21:09.000 align:start position:0%
stores these stores likely won't open
 
01:21:12.430 --> 01:21:12.440 align:start position:0%
for years and we will likely be unable
 
01:21:15.110 --> 01:21:15.120 align:start position:0%
to expand it from the 15 locations
 
01:21:17.510 --> 01:21:17.520 align:start position:0%
meaning that we will be limited people
 
01:21:19.629 --> 01:21:19.639 align:start position:0%
are going to continue using out ofate
 
01:21:22.550 --> 01:21:22.560 align:start position:0%
dispensaries to purchase uh or purchase
 
01:21:24.950 --> 01:21:24.960 align:start position:0%
on the black market because it's cheaper
 
01:21:28.550 --> 01:21:28.560 align:start position:0%
and it's closer to home finally I think
 
01:21:30.550 --> 01:21:30.560 align:start position:0%
we need to seriously consider the
 
01:21:32.669 --> 01:21:32.679 align:start position:0%
possibility that this bill will create
 
01:21:35.669 --> 01:21:35.679 align:start position:0%
an unworkable boond doggle no state has
 
01:21:37.830 --> 01:21:37.840 align:start position:0%
ever legally involved itself in the
 
01:21:39.629 --> 01:21:39.639 align:start position:0%
Cannabis industry before so the
 
01:21:42.790 --> 01:21:42.800 align:start position:0%
franchise model is legally risky and
 
01:21:45.590 --> 01:21:45.600 align:start position:0%
could expose our state to unforeseen
 
01:21:48.870 --> 01:21:48.880 align:start position:0%
liabilities also the other chamber added
 
01:21:51.030 --> 01:21:51.040 align:start position:0%
a new cannabis Control
 
01:21:53.430 --> 01:21:53.440 align:start position:0%
Commission that could easily become a
 
01:21:55.830 --> 01:21:55.840 align:start position:0%
roadblock to implementation
 
01:21:57.950 --> 01:21:57.960 align:start position:0%
this new commission would not actually
 
01:22:00.709 --> 01:22:00.719 align:start position:0%
regulate cannabis but it would have veto
 
01:22:03.830 --> 01:22:03.840 align:start position:0%
authority over all rules and the Liquor
 
01:22:06.030 --> 01:22:06.040 align:start position:0%
Commission could not present rules to
 
01:22:08.790 --> 01:22:08.800 align:start position:0%
jail car for approval unless the rules
 
01:22:10.870 --> 01:22:10.880 align:start position:0%
were first approved by the Cannabis
 
01:22:13.590 --> 01:22:13.600 align:start position:0%
Control Commission so who would be on
 
01:22:16.470 --> 01:22:16.480 align:start position:0%
this commission unlike The house's
 
01:22:19.070 --> 01:22:19.080 align:start position:0%
balanced Advisory Board the commission
 
01:22:22.350 --> 01:22:22.360 align:start position:0%
appears likely stacked with opponents of
 
01:22:25.229 --> 01:22:25.239 align:start position:0%
legalization only one of of the 13
 
01:22:27.189 --> 01:22:27.199 align:start position:0%
members would actually represent the
 
01:22:29.709 --> 01:22:29.719 align:start position:0%
Cannabis industry and the commission
 
01:22:31.669 --> 01:22:31.679 align:start position:0%
would also include the president of the
 
01:22:34.189 --> 01:22:34.199 align:start position:0%
police Chiefs Association the current
 
01:22:35.750 --> 01:22:35.760 align:start position:0%
commissioner of the AG uh the
 
01:22:37.950 --> 01:22:37.960 align:start position:0%
Commissioner of Agriculture who strongly
 
01:22:41.189 --> 01:22:41.199 align:start position:0%
opposes legalization and other likely
 
01:22:43.830 --> 01:22:43.840 align:start position:0%
opponents how can the Liquor Commission
 
01:22:45.950 --> 01:22:45.960 align:start position:0%
expect to create a viable Market if
 
01:22:48.189 --> 01:22:48.199 align:start position:0%
opponents of legalization are able to
 
01:22:50.189 --> 01:22:50.199 align:start position:0%
block the rulemaking
 
01:22:52.990 --> 01:22:53.000 align:start position:0%
process even the advocates for
 
01:22:55.430 --> 01:22:55.440 align:start position:0%
concurrence admit the bill is seriously
 
01:22:58.310 --> 01:22:58.320 align:start position:0%
flawed they say we need to pass it now
 
01:23:00.629 --> 01:23:00.639 align:start position:0%
and fix it in the future well if we do
 
01:23:02.990 --> 01:23:03.000 align:start position:0%
pass it I think we are going to be
 
01:23:05.910 --> 01:23:05.920 align:start position:0%
creating a lot of problems so many that
 
01:23:08.790 --> 01:23:08.800 align:start position:0%
many PE uh that many not be possible for
 
01:23:10.950 --> 01:23:10.960 align:start position:0%
us to fix in the future instead of
 
01:23:13.390 --> 01:23:13.400 align:start position:0%
rushing to pass a bill that we all know
 
01:23:16.550 --> 01:23:16.560 align:start position:0%
is flawed a bill that would not even
 
01:23:18.470 --> 01:23:18.480 align:start position:0%
eliminate position uh possession
 
01:23:20.110 --> 01:23:20.120 align:start position:0%
penalties until
 
01:23:22.830 --> 01:23:22.840 align:start position:0%
2026 let's reject this amendment and
 
01:23:26.310 --> 01:23:26.320 align:start position:0%
insist on making better policies for our
 
01:23:29.350 --> 01:23:29.360 align:start position:0%
constituents we will only get one chance
 
01:23:31.510 --> 01:23:31.520 align:start position:0%
to create a well-regulated market for
 
01:23:33.550 --> 01:23:33.560 align:start position:0%
adult ed cannabis and it's important we
 
01:23:39.110 --> 01:23:39.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:41.950 --> 01:23:41.960 align:start position:0%
right Mr Speaker this bill is
 
01:23:44.149 --> 01:23:44.159 align:start position:0%
inconsistent with New Hampshire values
 
01:23:46.189 --> 01:23:46.199 align:start position:0%
we cannot afford to ignore these
 
01:23:49.270 --> 01:23:49.280 align:start position:0%
important policy details in our rush to
 
01:23:51.750 --> 01:23:51.760 align:start position:0%
do something yes our constituents want
 
01:23:55.270 --> 01:23:55.280 align:start position:0%
legal legalization and so do I but as a
 
01:23:57.189 --> 01:23:57.199 align:start position:0%
Representatives I believe we have an
 
01:24:00.070 --> 01:24:00.080 align:start position:0%
obligation to insist on better policies
 
01:24:02.430 --> 01:24:02.440 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr member he other other
 
01:24:05.390 --> 01:24:05.400 align:start position:0%
questions no member does not
 
01:24:21.470 --> 01:24:21.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:26.470 --> 01:24:26.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:29.270 --> 01:24:29.280 align:start position:0%
speaker Mr
 
01:24:32.669 --> 01:24:32.679 align:start position:0%
Speaker I do have a prepared speech but
 
01:24:36.390 --> 01:24:36.400 align:start position:0%
I feel really compelled to respond to
 
01:24:38.510 --> 01:24:38.520 align:start position:0%
what was just
 
01:24:43.030 --> 01:24:43.040 align:start position:0%
said the atcs are absolutely totally
 
01:24:45.790 --> 01:24:45.800 align:start position:0%
unaffected by this legislation and as a
 
01:24:48.189 --> 01:24:48.199 align:start position:0%
matter of fact the reason they're
 
01:24:51.750 --> 01:24:51.760 align:start position:0%
unaffected is because they pay no
 
01:24:54.470 --> 01:24:54.480 align:start position:0%
tax do you really think we should have
 
01:24:57.550 --> 01:24:57.560 align:start position:0%
have a location where some people pay
 
01:24:59.830 --> 01:24:59.840 align:start position:0%
taxes and some
 
01:25:03.030 --> 01:25:03.040 align:start position:0%
don't if that is what the atc's want
 
01:25:06.270 --> 01:25:06.280 align:start position:0%
they could certainly convert and be a
 
01:25:06.280 --> 01:25:07.870 align:start position:0%
they could certainly convert and be a
full

01:25:07.870 --> 01:25:07.880 align:start position:0%
full
 
01:25:10.550 --> 01:25:10.560 align:start position:0%
franchise there was nothing in here that
 
01:25:13.790 --> 01:25:13.800 align:start position:0%
stops them from continuing as they are
 
01:25:13.800 --> 01:25:17.109 align:start position:0%
stops them from continuing as they are
now

01:25:17.109 --> 01:25:17.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:19.750 --> 01:25:19.760 align:start position:0%
taxfree this
 
01:25:22.229 --> 01:25:22.239 align:start position:0%
commission this commission was what was
 
01:25:22.239 --> 01:25:25.750 align:start position:0%
commission this commission was what was
requested

01:25:25.750 --> 01:25:25.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:30.550 --> 01:25:30.560 align:start position:0%
by the those who were opposed to this
 
01:25:34.350 --> 01:25:34.360 align:start position:0%
legislation who are they well new
 
01:25:36.950 --> 01:25:36.960 align:start position:0%
Futures and the chief of
 
01:25:40.950 --> 01:25:40.960 align:start position:0%
police but the funny thing is if you ask
 
01:25:43.189 --> 01:25:43.199 align:start position:0%
new Futures and chief of police about
 
01:25:45.149 --> 01:25:45.159 align:start position:0%
this amendment that's coming
 
01:25:47.270 --> 01:25:47.280 align:start position:0%
over they're going to tell you they
 
01:25:50.750 --> 01:25:50.760 align:start position:0%
could never get anything better than
 
01:25:53.629 --> 01:25:53.639 align:start position:0%
this so you could say as well the
 
01:25:55.750 --> 01:25:55.760 align:start position:0%
opposition said this can't be
 
01:25:59.550 --> 01:25:59.560 align:start position:0%
good that's the whole point of what the
 
01:25:59.560 --> 01:26:01.470 align:start position:0%
good that's the whole point of what the
Senate

01:26:01.470 --> 01:26:01.480 align:start position:0%
Senate
 
01:26:07.270 --> 01:26:07.280 align:start position:0%
did the Senate made this bill the
 
01:26:10.109 --> 01:26:10.119 align:start position:0%
ugliest most government
 
01:26:13.149 --> 01:26:13.159 align:start position:0%
intrusive most overregulation
 
01:26:16.790 --> 01:26:16.800 align:start position:0%
marijuana statute they could mend at the
 
01:26:16.800 --> 01:26:18.430 align:start position:0%
marijuana statute they could mend at the
Midnight

01:26:18.430 --> 01:26:18.440 align:start position:0%
Midnight
 
01:26:22.189 --> 01:26:22.199 align:start position:0%
Hour for One Singular
 
01:26:25.669 --> 01:26:25.679 align:start position:0%
purpose for you to vote no
 
01:26:29.870 --> 01:26:29.880 align:start position:0%
if you vote no they won they got what
 
01:26:32.629 --> 01:26:32.639 align:start position:0%
they wanted was to kill this bill to
 
01:26:32.639 --> 01:26:34.070 align:start position:0%
they wanted was to kill this bill to
kill

01:26:34.070 --> 01:26:34.080 align:start position:0%
kill
 
01:26:36.629 --> 01:26:36.639 align:start position:0%
cannabis they're just dreaming of the
 
01:26:41.310 --> 01:26:41.320 align:start position:0%
day when cannabis will not be passed for
 
01:26:46.390 --> 01:26:46.400 align:start position:0%
two four five who knows if it'll ever be
 
01:26:48.870 --> 01:26:48.880 align:start position:0%
passed as long as the Senate knows that
 
01:26:50.830 --> 01:26:50.840 align:start position:0%
they can just throw a bunch of crap into
 
01:26:56.390 --> 01:26:56.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:58.990 --> 01:26:59.000 align:start position:0%
that is the number one reason why you
 
01:27:03.910 --> 01:27:03.920 align:start position:0%
must vote today and you must vote Yes
 
01:27:05.590 --> 01:27:05.600 align:start position:0%
because we are not going to get caught
 
01:27:08.830 --> 01:27:08.840 align:start position:0%
in that Ploy we are going to get
 
01:27:12.109 --> 01:27:12.119 align:start position:0%
marijuana off the block we've got to get
 
01:27:12.119 --> 01:27:13.030 align:start position:0%
marijuana off the block we've got to get
it

01:27:13.030 --> 01:27:13.040 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:27:16.510 --> 01:27:16.520 align:start position:0%
going the reality is it's going to take
 
01:27:16.520 --> 01:27:18.030 align:start position:0%
going the reality is it's going to take
two

01:27:18.030 --> 01:27:18.040 align:start position:0%
two
 
01:27:20.950 --> 01:27:20.960 align:start position:0%
years two years even before the first
 
01:27:24.910 --> 01:27:24.920 align:start position:0%
bud is sold in this state we we'll have
 
01:27:28.149 --> 01:27:28.159 align:start position:0%
two not one two legislative
 
01:27:31.189 --> 01:27:31.199 align:start position:0%
sessions plenty of opportunities to work
 
01:27:33.550 --> 01:27:33.560 align:start position:0%
on this piece of well I don't want to
 
01:27:36.709 --> 01:27:36.719 align:start position:0%
call it what it is but that's call a
 
01:27:40.350 --> 01:27:40.360 align:start position:0%
enabling legislation for us to begin the
 
01:27:42.629 --> 01:27:42.639 align:start position:0%
conversation on how we are going to
 
01:27:46.830 --> 01:27:46.840 align:start position:0%
allow cannabis to be sold in this
 
01:27:50.950 --> 01:27:50.960 align:start position:0%
state now to the question of let's fix
 
01:27:54.270 --> 01:27:54.280 align:start position:0%
it later I've never heard of that well
 
01:27:56.149 --> 01:27:56.159 align:start position:0%
well why don't you come and visit the
 
01:27:56.159 --> 01:27:57.709 align:start position:0%
well why don't you come and visit the
Commerce

01:27:57.709 --> 01:27:57.719 align:start position:0%
Commerce
 
01:27:59.950 --> 01:27:59.960 align:start position:0%
Committee the Commerce Committee has
 
01:28:04.550 --> 01:28:04.560 align:start position:0%
been fixing the liquor law every single
 
01:28:08.470 --> 01:28:08.480 align:start position:0%
session we had Direct shipping we have
 
01:28:11.390 --> 01:28:11.400 align:start position:0%
self-distribute we today this
 
01:28:13.830 --> 01:28:13.840 align:start position:0%
year we're dealing with the Homegrown
 
01:28:16.950 --> 01:28:16.960 align:start position:0%
issue this year we're passing
 
01:28:18.629 --> 01:28:18.639 align:start position:0%
legislation and
 
01:28:24.750 --> 01:28:24.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:26.669 --> 01:28:26.679 align:start position:0%
that's something
 
01:28:29.270 --> 01:28:29.280 align:start position:0%
new if you want to grow a homegrown
 
01:28:31.790 --> 01:28:31.800 align:start position:0%
there is nothing in this bill that says
 
01:28:34.590 --> 01:28:34.600 align:start position:0%
you can't grow
 
01:28:36.950 --> 01:28:36.960 align:start position:0%
home unfortunately when it comes to
 
01:28:38.470 --> 01:28:38.480 align:start position:0%
these type of laws these are what we
 
01:28:41.709 --> 01:28:41.719 align:start position:0%
call Mother mayi laws it seems like if
 
01:28:43.470 --> 01:28:43.480 align:start position:0%
you don't say you can do it that means
 
01:28:46.350 --> 01:28:46.360 align:start position:0%
you can't do it but I can assure you
 
01:28:47.830 --> 01:28:47.840 align:start position:0%
that the Liquor Commission never
 
01:28:50.950 --> 01:28:50.960 align:start position:0%
arrested anybody for distilling in New
 
01:28:53.229 --> 01:28:53.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and the Liquor Commission is
 
01:28:56.229 --> 01:28:56.239 align:start position:0%
never going to go to anybody's
 
01:28:59.430 --> 01:28:59.440 align:start position:0%
home that is not their job their job is
 
01:29:01.790 --> 01:29:01.800 align:start position:0%
to look at the
 
01:29:04.189 --> 01:29:04.199 align:start position:0%
licenses that's their job they are not
 
01:29:06.709 --> 01:29:06.719 align:start position:0%
going after New Hampshire
 
01:29:09.270 --> 01:29:09.280 align:start position:0%
citizens so yes if you want to grow at
 
01:29:13.870 --> 01:29:13.880 align:start position:0%
home have at it nobody's stopping you
 
01:29:16.590 --> 01:29:16.600 align:start position:0%
local police might do
 
01:29:20.709 --> 01:29:20.719 align:start position:0%
that but we can get rid of that if you
 
01:29:24.830 --> 01:29:24.840 align:start position:0%
pass this bill now
 
01:29:28.870 --> 01:29:28.880 align:start position:0%

inquiry thank you Mr Speaker if I know
 
01:32:19.830 --> 01:32:19.840 align:start position:0%
that the amended bill before us re Bears
 
01:32:21.870 --> 01:32:21.880 align:start position:0%
very little resemblance to the very good
 
01:32:24.390 --> 01:32:24.400 align:start position:0%
bill that this bill passed by a wide
 
01:32:26.750 --> 01:32:26.760 align:start position:0%
margin in the house and if I know that
 
01:32:29.030 --> 01:32:29.040 align:start position:0%
this bill does not take effect until
 
01:32:32.109 --> 01:32:32.119 align:start position:0%
January of 2026 and will continue to
 
01:32:34.350 --> 01:32:34.360 align:start position:0%
encourage the conga line of cars that
 
01:32:36.830 --> 01:32:36.840 align:start position:0%
are heading out of state to buy products
 
01:32:38.910 --> 01:32:38.920 align:start position:0%
leaving as much as $60
 
01:32:41.149 --> 01:32:41.159 align:start position:0%
million off the table that could be
 
01:32:43.270 --> 01:32:43.280 align:start position:0%
coming um to us in the state of New
 
01:32:46.310 --> 01:32:46.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire in revenue and risking having
 
01:32:48.870 --> 01:32:48.880 align:start position:0%
dangerous products appear on the market
 
01:32:51.590 --> 01:32:51.600 align:start position:0%
and continuing criminalization of those
 
01:32:54.629 --> 01:32:54.639 align:start position:0%
who use cannabis and if I know that the
 
01:32:56.390 --> 01:32:56.400 align:start position:0%
belief that this new version of the
 
01:32:58.870 --> 01:32:58.880 align:start position:0%
Cannabis bills bill can simply be fixed
 
01:33:00.910 --> 01:33:00.920 align:start position:0%
next term is a
 
01:33:03.270 --> 01:33:03.280 align:start position:0%
fallacy and though I agree with my
 
01:33:05.629 --> 01:33:05.639 align:start position:0%
esteemed colleague from the castle Down
 
01:33:08.430 --> 01:33:08.440 align:start position:0%
Yonder that Commerce is an incredible
 
01:33:10.669 --> 01:33:10.679 align:start position:0%
committee and we do work on a partisan
 
01:33:12.990 --> 01:33:13.000 align:start position:0%
basis I do not feel that this is fixable
 
01:33:15.390 --> 01:33:15.400 align:start position:0%
next term and I also agree with my
 
01:33:18.550 --> 01:33:18.560 align:start position:0%
esteemed colleague that a gummy before
 
01:33:20.430 --> 01:33:20.440 align:start position:0%
going to bed would be better than a
 
01:33:22.830 --> 01:33:22.840 align:start position:0%
drink because I don't I only drink on
 
01:33:28.229 --> 01:33:28.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:31.910 --> 01:33:31.920 align:start position:0%

one um so in this particular bill um
 
01:40:10.310 --> 01:40:10.320 align:start position:0%
which is obviously controversial pasas
 
01:40:13.030 --> 01:40:13.040 align:start position:0%
but um I think it's been a real showing
 
01:40:16.030 --> 01:40:16.040 align:start position:0%
of our bipartisan work to get this right
 
01:40:18.350 --> 01:40:18.360 align:start position:0%
uh the Senate did uh kind of loosen up
 
01:40:20.229 --> 01:40:20.239 align:start position:0%
on the definition a little bit but I
 
01:40:22.189 --> 01:40:22.199 align:start position:0%
talked to the sponsor and she was okay
 
01:40:25.270 --> 01:40:25.280 align:start position:0%

when this bill originally came to our
 
01:45:05.310 --> 01:45:05.320 align:start position:0%
committee uh myself and I think
 
01:45:07.229 --> 01:45:07.239 align:start position:0%
everybody else that was there that day
 
01:45:09.189 --> 01:45:09.199 align:start position:0%
thought that we actually uh were handed
 
01:45:12.109 --> 01:45:12.119 align:start position:0%
a published novel and we were all a
 
01:45:13.550 --> 01:45:13.560 align:start position:0%
little bit confused a little bit
 
01:45:16.589 --> 01:45:16.599 align:start position:0%
overwhelmed what we were looking at and
 
01:45:18.350 --> 01:45:18.360 align:start position:0%
after we thought maybe it would be best
 
01:45:20.950 --> 01:45:20.960 align:start position:0%
to interim study this particular Bill we
 
01:45:22.390 --> 01:45:22.400 align:start position:0%
thought that that actually wasn't very
 
01:45:24.390 --> 01:45:24.400 align:start position:0%
fair that you know we really didn't
 
01:45:26.030 --> 01:45:26.040 align:start position:0%
understand all of the content it was
 
01:45:26.040 --> 01:45:26.790 align:start position:0%
understand all of the content it was
very

01:45:26.790 --> 01:45:26.800 align:start position:0%
very
 
01:45:29.189 --> 01:45:29.199 align:start position:0%
overwhelming and fortunately for us we
 
01:45:31.030 --> 01:45:31.040 align:start position:0%
had the opportunity to have the
 
01:45:33.070 --> 01:45:33.080 align:start position:0%
honorable retired Supreme Court Justice
 
01:45:34.430 --> 01:45:34.440 align:start position:0%

01:45:40.229 --> 01:45:40.239 align:start position:0%
further discussion we decided
 
01:45:43.589 --> 01:45:43.599 align:start position:0%

01:45:48.830 --> 01:45:48.840 align:start position:0%

to uh a juvenile justice study committee
 
01:48:24.470 --> 01:48:24.480 align:start position:0%
and there was really nothing
 
01:48:26.510 --> 01:48:26.520 align:start position:0%
substantially added to that other than
 
01:48:30.470 --> 01:48:30.480 align:start position:0%

with HB
 
01:49:29.550 --> 01:49:29.560 align:start position:0%

be used in New Hampshire as amended by

primary purpose of a business these

fraudulent the gun and ammunition store
 
01:50:29.310 --> 01:50:29.320 align:start position:0%
code in question allows Banks and credit
 
01:50:31.750 --> 01:50:31.760 align:start position:0%
card companies to develop rules-based
 
01:50:34.310 --> 01:50:34.320 align:start position:0%
transaction monitoring systems without
 
01:50:36.950 --> 01:50:36.960 align:start position:0%
drastically altering their internal
 
01:50:39.589 --> 01:50:39.599 align:start position:0%
systems for coding and processing

ammunition re retailers into the payment
 
01:50:47.270 --> 01:50:47.280 align:start position:0%
system would do is pretty simple it
 
01:50:49.310 --> 01:50:49.320 align:start position:0%
would allow banks that provide services
 
01:50:52.109 --> 01:50:52.119 align:start position:0%
to firearm Merchants uh and payment
 
01:50:54.589 --> 01:50:54.599 align:start position:0%

01:50:59.709 --> 01:50:59.719 align:start position:0%

enforcement for follow-up investigation
 
01:51:01.800 --> 01:51:02.910 align:start position:0%
enforcement for follow-up investigation
and

01:51:02.910 --> 01:51:02.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:51:05.470 --> 01:51:05.480 align:start position:0%
intervention as someone who's had his
 
01:51:08.350 --> 01:51:08.360 align:start position:0%
credit card information stolen multiple
 
01:51:11.069 --> 01:51:11.079 align:start position:0%
times over the years I don't consider
 
01:51:12.990 --> 01:51:13.000 align:start position:0%
things that Banks and credit card
 
01:51:15.229 --> 01:51:15.239 align:start position:0%
companies do to detect fraud and
 
01:51:18.189 --> 01:51:18.199 align:start position:0%
suspicious activity to be a violation of
 
01:51:18.199 --> 01:51:19.030 align:start position:0%
suspicious activity to be a violation of
my

01:51:19.030 --> 01:51:19.040 align:start position:0%
my
 
01:51:22.149 --> 01:51:22.159 align:start position:0%
privacy what I do consider them to be is
 
01:51:23.830 --> 01:51:23.840 align:start position:0%
an essential part of their
 
01:51:26.510 --> 01:51:26.520 align:start position:0%
responsibility to help me avoid being
 
01:51:28.109 --> 01:51:28.119 align:start position:0%
the victim of a
 
01:51:30.470 --> 01:51:30.480 align:start position:0%
crime something else that's worth noting
 
01:51:34.350 --> 01:51:34.360 align:start position:0%
is that these codes uh all they do is
 
01:51:36.350 --> 01:51:36.360 align:start position:0%
really list the category that the
 
01:51:38.790 --> 01:51:38.800 align:start position:0%
purchase falls into so in the case of
 
01:51:41.189 --> 01:51:41.199 align:start position:0%
the Firearms Merchants code all it will
 
01:51:43.350 --> 01:51:43.360 align:start position:0%
tell you is that something was purchased
 
01:51:45.149 --> 01:51:45.159 align:start position:0%
from a merchant who has assigned this
 
01:51:48.589 --> 01:51:48.599 align:start position:0%
code it won't tell you how many guns
 
01:51:50.990 --> 01:51:51.000 align:start position:0%
what type of guns how long you've wanted
 
01:51:53.550 --> 01:51:53.560 align:start position:0%
to own that particular gun or how much
 
01:51:55.229 --> 01:51:55.239 align:start position:0%
ammunition you
 
01:51:57.470 --> 01:51:57.480 align:start position:0%
purchased it also won't tell you if the
 
01:52:01.189 --> 01:52:01.199 align:start position:0%
gun was new or used or if it was an AR15
 
01:52:05.310 --> 01:52:05.320 align:start position:0%
or a daringer the bottom line is that
 
01:52:08.229 --> 01:52:08.239 align:start position:0%
the bottom line is that if this is a gun
 
01:52:11.189 --> 01:52:11.199 align:start position:0%
registry which supporters of the bill
 
01:52:15.030 --> 01:52:15.040 align:start position:0%
claim it would be the most useless gun
 
01:52:15.040 --> 01:52:16.709 align:start position:0%
claim it would be the most useless gun
registry

01:52:16.709 --> 01:52:16.719 align:start position:0%
registry
 
01:52:20.030 --> 01:52:20.040 align:start position:0%
ever the bill is not about protecting
 
01:52:22.709 --> 01:52:22.719 align:start position:0%
privacy it's about protecting the
 
01:52:25.109 --> 01:52:25.119 align:start position:0%
entitlement of an entire industry to
 
01:52:26.990 --> 01:52:27.000 align:start position:0%
operate without a trace of
 
01:52:30.229 --> 01:52:30.239 align:start position:0%
accountability for any form of Public
 
01:52:32.669 --> 01:52:32.679 align:start position:0%
Safety this is a bill that will make it
 
01:52:35.229 --> 01:52:35.239 align:start position:0%
easier for gun traffickers potential
 
01:52:38.470 --> 01:52:38.480 align:start position:0%
Mass Shooters illegal straw purchasers
 
01:52:40.629 --> 01:52:40.639 align:start position:0%
and criminals who fraudulently run up
 
01:52:43.069 --> 01:52:43.079 align:start position:0%
charges on other people's credit cards
 
01:52:46.310 --> 01:52:46.320 align:start position:0%
to commit crimes it is also a bill that
 
01:52:48.870 --> 01:52:48.880 align:start position:0%
the Department of Justice tells us will
 
01:52:50.870 --> 01:52:50.880 align:start position:0%
require an additional part-time
 
01:52:53.950 --> 01:52:53.960 align:start position:0%
investigator and a part time attorney to
 
01:52:57.069 --> 01:52:57.079 align:start position:0%
implement at a cost of approximately
 
01:53:00.910 --> 01:53:00.920 align:start position:0%

01:53:12.390 --> 01:53:12.400 align:start position:0%
Roy thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker I I
 
01:53:14.430 --> 01:53:14.440 align:start position:0%
am really sorry that my friend from Port
 
01:53:16.109 --> 01:53:16.119 align:start position:0%
Smith's credit card information was
 
01:53:18.229 --> 01:53:18.239 align:start position:0%
stolen but I can guarantee you it wasn't
 
01:53:20.870 --> 01:53:20.880 align:start position:0%
for purchasing a firearm
 
01:53:23.270 --> 01:53:23.280 align:start position:0%
um I would
 
01:53:25.470 --> 01:53:25.480 align:start position:0%
point out that this is not about
 
01:53:27.629 --> 01:53:27.639 align:start position:0%
Firearms only think about this for a
 
01:53:29.790 --> 01:53:29.800 align:start position:0%
second they're not doing this to track
 
01:53:31.709 --> 01:53:31.719 align:start position:0%
fish and rods they're not doing it to
 
01:53:33.750 --> 01:53:33.760 align:start position:0%
track tents they're not doing it to
 
01:53:37.109 --> 01:53:37.119 align:start position:0%
track cars bicycles basketballs only
 
01:53:40.109 --> 01:53:40.119 align:start position:0%
Firearms now we just got into a little
 
01:53:43.589 --> 01:53:43.599 align:start position:0%
thing here about marijuana now what if
 
01:53:45.430 --> 01:53:45.440 align:start position:0%
the federal government started putting a
 
01:53:48.229 --> 01:53:48.239 align:start position:0%
code on your purchases for marijuana
 
01:53:50.030 --> 01:53:50.040 align:start position:0%
what if they started putting codes on
 
01:53:51.669 --> 01:53:51.679 align:start position:0%
other things that the federal government
 
01:53:53.189 --> 01:53:53.199 align:start position:0%
decide they didn't let like and they
 
01:53:55.109 --> 01:53:55.119 align:start position:0%
could track who purchased it and who had
 
01:53:57.629 --> 01:53:57.639 align:start position:0%
it a lot of bad things could happen with
 
01:53:59.870 --> 01:53:59.880 align:start position:0%
that if you happen to have a CDL license
 
01:54:01.750 --> 01:54:01.760 align:start position:0%
and you drive a truck when you go out
 
01:54:04.189 --> 01:54:04.199 align:start position:0%
and you purchase our legal marijuana
 
01:54:05.990 --> 01:54:06.000 align:start position:0%
guess what that little code can lead
 
01:54:08.430 --> 01:54:08.440 align:start position:0%
back to your CDL license being revoked
 
01:54:10.470 --> 01:54:10.480 align:start position:0%
and that goes on and on for many many
 
01:54:14.550 --> 01:54:14.560 align:start position:0%
things this is about Firearms yet first
 
01:54:16.510 --> 01:54:16.520 align:start position:0%
you know my friend said well it's really
 
01:54:18.790 --> 01:54:18.800 align:start position:0%
about um credit card safety but then he
 
01:54:21.189 --> 01:54:21.199 align:start position:0%
went on to say it's about Public Safety
 
01:54:23.669 --> 01:54:23.679 align:start position:0%
which is it it's not about that it's
 
01:54:26.030 --> 01:54:26.040 align:start position:0%
about the federal government tracking
 
01:54:29.830 --> 01:54:29.840 align:start position:0%
what we do on a microscopic level and we
 
01:54:32.270 --> 01:54:32.280 align:start position:0%
at a state where we very rarely have
 
01:54:34.390 --> 01:54:34.400 align:start position:0%
control over things like this have an
 
01:54:36.870 --> 01:54:36.880 align:start position:0%
opportunity to say no not in New
 
01:54:38.830 --> 01:54:38.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I would ask you to concur
 
01:54:38.840 --> 01:54:41.709 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I would ask you to concur
thank

01:55:25.440 --> 01:55:56.149 align:start position:0%
 
was

01:55:56.149 --> 01:55:56.159 align:start position:0%

01:56:04.109 --> 01:56:04.119 align:start position:0%
chair recognized representative Harriet
 
01:56:09.430 --> 01:56:09.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:12.870 --> 01:56:12.880 align:start position:0%
inquiry thank you Mr Speaker if I know
 
01:56:15.350 --> 01:56:15.360 align:start position:0%
this bill is not about protecting
 
01:56:18.470 --> 01:56:18.480 align:start position:0%
privacy and if I know it's definitely
 
01:56:21.870 --> 01:56:21.880 align:start position:0%
not about protecting Public Safety and

Lane thank you Mr
 
03:27:09.830 --> 03:27:09.840 align:start position:0%
Speaker well so here we are again those
 
03:27:13.750 --> 03:27:13.760 align:start position:0%
who want a June primary are definitely
 
03:27:16.830 --> 03:27:16.840 align:start position:0%
persistent we have already voted down a
 
03:27:21.710 --> 03:27:21.720 align:start position:0%
June primary on the second Tuesday twice
 
03:27:25.110 --> 03:27:25.120 align:start position:0%
once in January and once in
 
03:27:27.870 --> 03:27:27.880 align:start position:0%
May and now we need to vote down the
 
03:27:31.630 --> 03:27:31.640 align:start position:0%
third Tuesday in June changing the date
 
03:27:34.990 --> 03:27:35.000 align:start position:0%
by one week in order to avoid the
 
03:27:38.469 --> 03:27:38.479 align:start position:0%
indefinite postponement vote on May 2nd
 
03:27:41.950 --> 03:27:41.960 align:start position:0%
makes no difference to those of us who
 
03:27:46.630 --> 03:27:46.640 align:start position:0%
voted against a June primary June
 
03:27:49.750 --> 03:27:49.760 align:start position:0%
is June we want
 
03:27:53.389 --> 03:27:53.399 align:start position:0%
August let me remind you why we have
 
03:27:56.870 --> 03:27:56.880 align:start position:0%
overwhelmingly killed a June primary
 
03:27:58.510 --> 03:27:58.520 align:start position:0%
twice this
 
03:28:02.229 --> 03:28:02.239 align:start position:0%
year it means yearlong campaigning for
 
03:28:05.269 --> 03:28:05.279 align:start position:0%
our constituents to endure and frankly
 
03:28:06.790 --> 03:28:06.800 align:start position:0%
for us to
 
03:28:10.870 --> 03:28:10.880 align:start position:0%
endure we start in January with the town
 
03:28:15.229 --> 03:28:15.239 align:start position:0%
offices you register you run for three
 
03:28:17.750 --> 03:28:17.760 align:start position:0%
months then in March you if you're going
 
03:28:20.229 --> 03:28:20.239 align:start position:0%
to be a State Rep or a state senator you
 
03:28:22.630 --> 03:28:22.640 align:start position:0%
have to register and then run for that
 
03:28:26.150 --> 03:28:26.160 align:start position:0%
office too when you're done in June
 
03:28:27.790 --> 03:28:27.800 align:start position:0%
which means that we would all be
 
03:28:29.510 --> 03:28:29.520 align:start position:0%
campaigning right
 
03:28:32.269 --> 03:28:32.279 align:start position:0%
now when you're done in June then you
 
03:28:34.790 --> 03:28:34.800 align:start position:0%
get to campaign to
 
03:28:37.630 --> 03:28:37.640 align:start position:0%
November frankly I'm glad I live in a
 
03:28:40.429 --> 03:28:40.439 align:start position:0%
city and not a town because we vote in
 
03:28:44.510 --> 03:28:44.520 align:start position:0%
different years but we will have both
 
03:28:48.189 --> 03:28:48.199 align:start position:0%
constituent and candidate fatigue if
 
03:28:50.349 --> 03:28:50.359 align:start position:0%
anything it may discourage people from
 
03:28:52.750 --> 03:28:52.760 align:start position:0%
running for state
 
03:28:55.590 --> 03:28:55.600 align:start position:0%
representative also this will increase
 
03:28:59.389 --> 03:28:59.399 align:start position:0%
campaign costs longer time to campaign
 
03:29:01.510 --> 03:29:01.520 align:start position:0%
means you're going to be spending more
 
03:29:04.590 --> 03:29:04.600 align:start position:0%
money making it even more expensive to
 
03:29:07.110 --> 03:29:07.120 align:start position:0%
run for State Rep than it is
 
03:29:10.790 --> 03:29:10.800 align:start position:0%
now again this house has spoken twice on
 
03:29:10.800 --> 03:29:12.110 align:start position:0%
now again this house has spoken twice on
this

03:29:12.110 --> 03:29:12.120 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:29:15.269 --> 03:29:15.279 align:start position:0%
issue Let the Body on the other side of
 
03:29:16.590 --> 03:29:16.600 align:start position:0%
the wall know
 
03:29:19.750 --> 03:29:19.760 align:start position:0%
that we are determined so please send
 
03:29:23.070 --> 03:29:23.080 align:start position:0%
them a message for the third time that
 
03:29:26.590 --> 03:29:26.600 align:start position:0%
we do not want a June primary no matter
 
03:29:30.710 --> 03:29:30.720 align:start position:0%
which Tuesday in June it is thank
 
03:29:32.910 --> 03:29:32.920 align:start position:0%
you chair recognize Representative
 
03:29:35.469 --> 03:29:35.479 align:start position:0%
Steven Smith Mr
 
03:29:37.870 --> 03:29:37.880 align:start position:0%
Speaker I'm sorry I wanted to request a
 
03:29:44.269 --> 03:29:44.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:47.030 --> 03:29:47.040 align:start position:0%
you thank you Mr Speaker
 
03:29:48.790 --> 03:29:48.800 align:start position:0%
speaker we we've heard all these
 
03:29:50.670 --> 03:29:50.680 align:start position:0%
arguments and I'm not going to rehash it
 
03:29:52.229 --> 03:29:52.239 align:start position:0%
yeah so now it's a different day in June
 
03:29:54.389 --> 03:29:54.399 align:start position:0%
that's what's before you but I do want
 
03:29:56.670 --> 03:29:56.680 align:start position:0%
to address one thing I I think we
 
03:29:59.830 --> 03:29:59.840 align:start position:0%
campaign differently so when we're not
 
03:30:02.269 --> 03:30:02.279 align:start position:0%
in campaign mode I still go in my
 
03:30:04.830 --> 03:30:04.840 align:start position:0%
district and take care of local issues I
 
03:30:06.550 --> 03:30:06.560 align:start position:0%
still go to a select board meeting when
 
03:30:09.710 --> 03:30:09.720 align:start position:0%
I'm asked to I just handled an issue
 
03:30:13.790 --> 03:30:13.800 align:start position:0%
with a bridge in my town I go places I
 
03:30:16.189 --> 03:30:16.199 align:start position:0%
experience what the people experience I
 
03:30:19.309 --> 03:30:19.319 align:start position:0%
don't have to wait until July to do that
 
03:30:22.429 --> 03:30:22.439 align:start position:0%
I know that in my district the best subs
 
03:30:24.670 --> 03:30:24.680 align:start position:0%
are of course at Corona's Market often
 
03:30:27.830 --> 03:30:27.840 align:start position:0%
imitated never equals if you if you
 
03:30:29.830 --> 03:30:29.840 align:start position:0%
don't know that you're going to have
 
03:30:31.670 --> 03:30:31.680 align:start position:0%
trouble running in Newport and you don't
 
03:30:33.590 --> 03:30:33.600 align:start position:0%
have to wait till July to go there I
 
03:30:35.550 --> 03:30:35.560 align:start position:0%
know which of the two pizza places in
 
03:30:37.389 --> 03:30:37.399 align:start position:0%
that town you go to if you want the
 
03:30:40.429 --> 03:30:40.439 align:start position:0%
pizza or the calzone I go to veterans
 
03:30:43.790 --> 03:30:43.800 align:start position:0%
events I don't ever stop doing those
 
03:30:46.710 --> 03:30:46.720 align:start position:0%
things because I don't ever stop stop
 
03:30:48.990 --> 03:30:49.000 align:start position:0%
being the representative it doesn't cost
 
03:30:51.269 --> 03:30:51.279 align:start position:0%
a lot of money that's how I do it I
 
03:30:53.110 --> 03:30:53.120 align:start position:0%
don't know what you guys are spending on
 
03:30:55.070 --> 03:30:55.080 align:start position:0%
but if you're blowing thousands of
 
03:30:57.710 --> 03:30:57.720 align:start position:0%
dollars on mailers maybe just get out a
 
03:31:00.269 --> 03:31:00.279 align:start position:0%
little more so anyway I hope you can
 
03:31:02.349 --> 03:31:02.359 align:start position:0%
support the motion to
 
03:31:05.110 --> 03:31:05.120 align:start position:0%

03:32:11.670 --> 03:32:11.680 align:start position:0%
inquiry thank you Mr
 
03:32:15.389 --> 03:32:15.399 align:start position:0%
Speaker Mr Speaker if I know that hb15
 
03:32:19.269 --> 03:32:19.279 align:start position:0%
came from this body with a 70% vote for
 
03:32:22.269 --> 03:32:22.279 align:start position:0%
the primary to be in August and should
 
03:32:25.309 --> 03:32:25.319 align:start position:0%
be law now and if I know that we
 
03:32:28.750 --> 03:32:28.760 align:start position:0%
indefinitely postponed sp sp 380 and
 
03:32:31.269 --> 03:32:31.279 align:start position:0%
this amendment amended bill is only
 
03:32:34.309 --> 03:32:34.319 align:start position:0%
about one word different from that bill
 
03:32:36.429 --> 03:32:36.439 align:start position:0%
and if I know that I believe in State's
 
03:32:38.630 --> 03:32:38.640 align:start position:0%
rights and as such we should not be
 
03:32:42.110 --> 03:32:42.120 align:start position:0%
mandated by a National Organization of
 
03:32:45.030 --> 03:32:45.040 align:start position:0%
what they want and if I know that the
 
03:32:48.670 --> 03:32:48.680 align:start position:0%
current law does not benefit
 
03:32:50.990 --> 03:32:51.000 align:start position:0%
incumbents if so then why aren't

03:43:51.070 --> 03:43:51.080 align:start position:0%

03:44:55.910 --> 03:44:55.920 align:start position:0%
Bill 1310 this is a division vote chair
 
03:44:57.189 --> 03:44:57.199 align:start position:0%
recognized represent Ward for
 
03:44:57.199 --> 03:45:00.950 align:start position:0%

03:45:00.950 --> 03:45:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:03.110 --> 03:45:03.120 align:start position:0%
inquiry thank you Mr
 
03:45:05.870 --> 03:45:05.880 align:start position:0%
Speaker Mr Speaker if I know that this
 
03:45:07.510 --> 03:45:07.520 align:start position:0%
bill requires meetings of the
 
03:45:09.429 --> 03:45:09.439 align:start position:0%
supervisors of the checklist to occur
 
03:45:12.910 --> 03:45:12.920 align:start position:0%
every 90 days a mandate that somehow is
 
03:45:15.269 --> 03:45:15.279 align:start position:0%
redundant on the one hand and un needed
 
03:45:17.830 --> 03:45:17.840 align:start position:0%
on the other because if I also know that
 
03:45:19.630 --> 03:45:19.640 align:start position:0%
in most cities the supervisors and
 
03:45:22.469 --> 03:45:22.479 align:start position:0%
registrars already meet more than that
 
03:45:24.910 --> 03:45:24.920 align:start position:0%
at least once a month in my city but if
 
03:45:26.750 --> 03:45:26.760 align:start position:0%
I also know that in many towns there is
 
03:45:28.590 --> 03:45:28.600 align:start position:0%
absolutely no need to meet so often
 
03:45:31.149 --> 03:45:31.159 align:start position:0%
given the small voter pool and thus this
 
03:45:33.229 --> 03:45:33.239 align:start position:0%
bill places an unnecessary burden on
 
03:45:35.790 --> 03:45:35.800 align:start position:0%
those public servants and if I know in
 
03:45:37.469 --> 03:45:37.479 align:start position:0%
addition that the supervisors are
 
03:45:39.389 --> 03:45:39.399 align:start position:0%
already required by law to meet at
 
03:45:42.070 --> 03:45:42.080 align:start position:0%
several important times dictated by the
 
03:45:44.550 --> 03:45:44.560 align:start position:0%
election calendar and also at the
 
03:45:47.269 --> 03:45:47.279 align:start position:0%
request of the secretary of state but I
 
03:45:49.110 --> 03:45:49.120 align:start position:0%
then press the red button to overturn
 
03:45:51.590 --> 03:45:51.600 align:start position:0%
this attempt at micromanagement that in
 
03:45:53.990 --> 03:45:54.000 align:start position:0%
truth serves no useful purpose thank you
 
03:45:56.710 --> 03:45:56.720 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker chair recognize quy for a
 
03:45:56.720 --> 03:46:00.469 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker chair recognize quy for a
parliamentary

03:46:00.469 --> 03:46:00.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:04.070 --> 03:46:04.080 align:start position:0%
inquiry thank you Mr Speaker if I know
 
03:46:07.550 --> 03:46:07.560 align:start position:0%
that this bill as passed by the house
 
03:46:07.560 --> 03:46:08.630 align:start position:0%
that this bill as passed by the house
ensures

03:46:08.630 --> 03:46:08.640 align:start position:0%
ensures
 
03:46:11.389 --> 03:46:11.399 align:start position:0%
that supervisors of the checklist beat
 
03:46:14.309 --> 03:46:14.319 align:start position:0%
on a regular basis to keep the checklist
 
03:46:15.790 --> 03:46:15.800 align:start position:0%
up to date
 
03:46:19.149 --> 03:46:19.159 align:start position:0%
but that it also included an exemption
 
03:46:22.349 --> 03:46:22.359 align:start position:0%
from public notice if
 
03:46:24.630 --> 03:46:24.640 align:start position:0%
reconvening an already adjourned meeting
 
03:46:26.510 --> 03:46:26.520 align:start position:0%
of the supervisor of the checklist and
 
03:46:28.830 --> 03:46:28.840 align:start position:0%
that the only difference between the
 
03:46:30.670 --> 03:46:30.680 align:start position:0%
position of the house and the position
 
03:46:33.910 --> 03:46:33.920 align:start position:0%
of the Senate is that the Senate removed
 
03:46:36.550 --> 03:46:36.560 align:start position:0%
that exemption from public notice for
 
03:46:38.870 --> 03:46:38.880 align:start position:0%
reconvening an adjourned meeting and
 
03:46:40.910 --> 03:46:40.920 align:start position:0%
furthermore if I know that in the
 
03:46:43.790 --> 03:46:43.800 align:start position:0%
interest of uh transparency in public
 
03:46:45.630 --> 03:46:45.640 align:start position:0%
knowledge of when
 
03:46:47.070 --> 03:46:47.080 align:start position:0%
meetings of the supervisors of the
 
03:46:48.349 --> 03:46:48.359 align:start position:0%
checklist occurred that this is a
 
03:46:49.670 --> 03:46:49.680 align:start position:0%
reasonable change on the part of the
 
03:46:51.870 --> 03:46:51.880 align:start position:0%
Senate would I then press the green

inquiry thank you Mr
 
04:02:10.550 --> 04:02:10.560 align:start position:0%
Speaker if I know that physician
 
04:02:12.830 --> 04:02:12.840 align:start position:0%
assistants are important and valued
 
04:02:15.030 --> 04:02:15.040 align:start position:0%
members of healthcare teams whose
 
04:02:16.750 --> 04:02:16.760 align:start position:0%
current training does not prepare them
 
04:02:20.269 --> 04:02:20.279 align:start position:0%
for independent practice even with 8,000
 
04:02:23.110 --> 04:02:23.120 align:start position:0%
hours of unsupervised collaborative
 
04:02:25.990 --> 04:02:26.000 align:start position:0%
practice and that this bill fails to
 
04:02:28.469 --> 04:02:28.479 align:start position:0%
address key dimensions for quality and
 
04:02:31.229 --> 04:02:31.239 align:start position:0%
safety specifically determination of
 
04:02:33.990 --> 04:02:34.000 align:start position:0%
competence and scope of practice and if
 
04:02:37.630 --> 04:02:37.640 align:start position:0%
I know that HB 1222 needs further work
 
04:02:40.110 --> 04:02:40.120 align:start position:0%
and should not be rushed as this is a
 
04:02:42.630 --> 04:02:42.640 align:start position:0%
complex issue that requires thoughtful
 
04:02:45.269 --> 04:02:45.279 align:start position:0%
study then then would I now press the
 
04:02:49.309 --> 04:02:49.319 align:start position:0%
green t green button to table this bill
 
04:02:51.550 --> 04:02:51.560 align:start position:0%
and I ask for a division vote chair
 
04:02:52.950 --> 04:02:52.960 align:start position:0%

04:03:06.670 --> 04:03:06.680 align:start position:0%
we had subcommittee hearings and we

04:03:11.510 --> 04:03:11.520 align:start position:0%
thoroughly and we voted and we presented
 
04:03:14.910 --> 04:03:14.920 align:start position:0%
a house floor amendment that that led to
 
04:03:18.670 --> 04:03:18.680 align:start position:0%
a Voice vote that passed this house and
 
04:03:22.189 --> 04:03:22.199 align:start position:0%
if I know that the Senate added further
 
04:03:25.630 --> 04:03:25.640 align:start position:0%
restrictions to physician assistance in
 
04:03:29.110 --> 04:03:29.120 align:start position:0%

Speaker physician assistants are
 
04:05:24.550 --> 04:05:24.560 align:start position:0%
important and valued members of
 
04:05:26.110 --> 04:05:26.120 align:start position:0%
healthcare teams across the state and
 
04:05:28.269 --> 04:05:28.279 align:start position:0%
have provided excellent care to my
 
04:05:31.469 --> 04:05:31.479 align:start position:0%
family an independent practice is a
 
04:05:35.389 --> 04:05:35.399 align:start position:0%
understandable good goal and HP 1222
 
04:05:37.269 --> 04:05:37.279 align:start position:0%
needs further work it should not be
 
04:05:40.149 --> 04:05:40.159 align:start position:0%
rushed through I'm a trained Health
 
04:05:41.990 --> 04:05:42.000 align:start position:0%
Services researcher and have spent my
 
04:05:44.429 --> 04:05:44.439 align:start position:0%
whole professional life working to
 
04:05:48.269 --> 04:05:48.279 align:start position:0%
increase access to and quality of Health
 
04:05:50.710 --> 04:05:50.720 align:start position:0%
Care especially for the most vulnerable
 
04:05:53.590 --> 04:05:53.600 align:start position:0%
and underserved thus I understand the
 
04:05:55.389 --> 04:05:55.399 align:start position:0%
motivation for this bill to address
 
04:05:59.670 --> 04:05:59.680 align:start position:0%
Workforce shortages in our state however
 
04:06:01.510 --> 04:06:01.520 align:start position:0%
this bill needs further work and should
 
04:06:04.830 --> 04:06:04.840 align:start position:0%
not be rushed this is a complex issue
 
04:06:07.670 --> 04:06:07.680 align:start position:0%
and this bill fails to address quality
 
04:06:10.070 --> 04:06:10.080 align:start position:0%
and safety issues related to competence
 
04:06:11.429 --> 04:06:11.439 align:start position:0%
and scope of
 
04:06:15.030 --> 04:06:15.040 align:start position:0%
practice to contrast Physicians MDS and
 
04:06:18.349 --> 04:06:18.359 align:start position:0%
Do's and nurse practitioners must
 
04:06:21.189 --> 04:06:21.199 align:start position:0%
demonstrate competence within a scope of
 
04:06:23.670 --> 04:06:23.680 align:start position:0%
practice prior to practicing
 
04:06:25.830 --> 04:06:25.840 align:start position:0%
independently physician assistants who
 
04:06:27.950 --> 04:06:27.960 align:start position:0%
have significantly less training should
 
04:06:29.750 --> 04:06:29.760 align:start position:0%
be held to the same standard for
 
04:06:29.760 --> 04:06:31.229 align:start position:0%
be held to the same standard for
assuring

04:06:31.229 --> 04:06:31.239 align:start position:0%
assuring
 
04:06:33.670 --> 04:06:33.680 align:start position:0%
competence as it stands this bill
 
04:06:35.990 --> 04:06:36.000 align:start position:0%
essentially grants special status to
 
04:06:38.389 --> 04:06:38.399 align:start position:0%
physician assistant first by not
 
04:06:40.950 --> 04:06:40.960 align:start position:0%
requiring them to demonstrate competence
 
04:06:43.110 --> 04:06:43.120 align:start position:0%
with a certification exam and assessment
 
04:06:45.590 --> 04:06:45.600 align:start position:0%
process after completing the proposed
 
04:06:49.389 --> 04:06:49.399 align:start position:0%
8,000 hours of unsupervised practice and
 
04:06:51.830 --> 04:06:51.840 align:start position:0%
second by not delineating a scope of
 
04:06:54.070 --> 04:06:54.080 align:start position:0%
practice meaning someone who completed
 
04:06:57.269 --> 04:06:57.279 align:start position:0%
8,000 hours such as in Urgent Care could
 
04:06:59.870 --> 04:06:59.880 align:start position:0%
open a practice in a different area such
 
04:07:03.189 --> 04:07:03.199 align:start position:0%
as neurology or surgery or Primary Care
 
04:07:07.229 --> 04:07:07.239 align:start position:0%
thus this issue Merit thoughtful study
 
04:07:09.469 --> 04:07:09.479 align:start position:0%
independent practice is very complicated
 
04:07:12.269 --> 04:07:12.279 align:start position:0%
and must be appropriately studied before
 
04:07:15.309 --> 04:07:15.319 align:start position:0%
expanding inde dependent practice so we
 
04:07:17.510 --> 04:07:17.520 align:start position:0%
can take the necessary time to
 
04:07:19.670 --> 04:07:19.680 align:start position:0%
understand all the implications and make
 
04:07:22.830 --> 04:07:22.840 align:start position:0%
sure we get it right I urge you to vote
 
04:07:25.790 --> 04:07:25.800 align:start position:0%
against concurrence and Mr Speaker I ask
 
04:07:28.870 --> 04:07:28.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:35.710 --> 04:07:35.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:38.070 --> 04:07:38.080 align:start position:0%
Simon thank you Mr Speaker I we haveed
 
04:07:40.510 --> 04:07:40.520 align:start position:0%
off and here I am back again um I'm
 
04:07:42.990 --> 04:07:43.000 align:start position:0%
hoping that the tabling motion vote uh
 
04:07:44.550 --> 04:07:44.560 align:start position:0%
is what we're basically looking at I
 
04:07:46.189 --> 04:07:46.199 align:start position:0%
don't want to take up tooo much time on
 
04:07:48.149 --> 04:07:48.159 align:start position:0%
this particular bill um but the Senate
 
04:07:50.950 --> 04:07:50.960 align:start position:0%
Amendment adds an 8,000 hour um
 
04:07:52.630 --> 04:07:52.640 align:start position:0%
requirement so that they'll have to put
 
04:07:55.030 --> 04:07:55.040 align:start position:0%
in 8 8,000 hours of practice before they
 
04:07:57.389 --> 04:07:57.399 align:start position:0%
can ask for a waiver from the Board of
 
04:07:59.670 --> 04:07:59.680 align:start position:0%
Medicine to practice independently
 
04:08:01.229 --> 04:08:01.239 align:start position:0%
whatever um they're going to be
 
04:08:02.469 --> 04:08:02.479 align:start position:0%
practicing the Board of Medicine is
 
04:08:04.469 --> 04:08:04.479 align:start position:0%
going to have to approve that uh so it's
 
04:08:05.990 --> 04:08:06.000 align:start position:0%
not like it's a free-for-all they do
 
04:08:07.590 --> 04:08:07.600 align:start position:0%
their 8,000 hours and then they can just
 
04:08:09.750 --> 04:08:09.760 align:start position:0%
practice independently um they will have
 
04:08:11.349 --> 04:08:11.359 align:start position:0%
to ask for a waiver from the Board of
 
04:08:12.790 --> 04:08:12.800 align:start position:0%
Medicine the Board of Medicine is going
 
04:08:14.229 --> 04:08:14.239 align:start position:0%
to have to look at each individual
 
04:08:16.349 --> 04:08:16.359 align:start position:0%
person who's applying for that waiver um
 
04:08:18.349 --> 04:08:18.359 align:start position:0%
review their credentials whether or not
 
04:08:20.189 --> 04:08:20.199 align:start position:0%
um they are qualified to to work
 
04:08:21.870 --> 04:08:21.880 align:start position:0%
independently and then approve it what
 
04:08:23.910 --> 04:08:23.920 align:start position:0%
we have right now is just um a
 
04:08:25.349 --> 04:08:25.359 align:start position:0%
collaboration agreement that every
 
04:08:27.870 --> 04:08:27.880 align:start position:0%
Physician's assist assistant has to sign
 
04:08:30.870 --> 04:08:30.880 align:start position:0%
um with a physician in order to practice
 
04:08:32.790 --> 04:08:32.800 align:start position:0%
many times those Physicians are nowhere
 
04:08:34.309 --> 04:08:34.319 align:start position:0%
in the building they may not even be in
 
04:08:36.309 --> 04:08:36.319 align:start position:0%
the state um it's a piece of paper
 
04:08:37.790 --> 04:08:37.800 align:start position:0%
that's signed I have a physician
 
04:08:39.510 --> 04:08:39.520 align:start position:0%
assistant uh who's been practicing for
 
04:08:41.429 --> 04:08:41.439 align:start position:0%
over 20 years in Littleton who has to
 
04:08:44.469 --> 04:08:44.479 align:start position:0%
pay $20,000 a year for that signed piece
 
04:08:46.109 --> 04:08:46.119 align:start position:0%
of paper uh
 
04:08:48.830 --> 04:08:48.840 align:start position:0%
$20,000 in order to have that uh we have
 
04:08:50.389 --> 04:08:50.399 align:start position:0%
doctors who are now opening up
 
04:08:52.630 --> 04:08:52.640 align:start position:0%
businesses just to sign these
 
04:08:54.349 --> 04:08:54.359 align:start position:0%
collaboration agreements because there's
 
04:08:57.309 --> 04:08:57.319 align:start position:0%
so much money in it um and so for those
 
04:08:58.990 --> 04:08:59.000 align:start position:0%
reasons uh I would ask that you would
 
04:09:00.790 --> 04:09:00.800 align:start position:0%
allow physici assistance to work within
 
04:09:02.830 --> 04:09:02.840 align:start position:0%

inquiry thank you Mr Mr Speaker if I
 
04:18:16.670 --> 04:18:16.680 align:start position:0%
know everything that I knew when I made
 
04:18:20.229 --> 04:18:20.239 align:start position:0%
the motion on Senate 440 which we
 
04:18:22.670 --> 04:18:22.680 align:start position:0%
discussed two weeks ago a motion that
 
04:18:24.950 --> 04:18:24.960 align:start position:0%
passed 224 to
 
04:18:28.469 --> 04:18:28.479 align:start position:0%
137 which is now present in House Bill
 
04:18:30.870 --> 04:18:30.880 align:start position:0%
1420 and if I know that the current
 
04:18:34.750 --> 04:18:34.760 align:start position:0%
before us bill before us is lacking in
 
04:18:37.550 --> 04:18:37.560 align:start position:0%
subjective legislative or stakeholder
 
04:18:40.429 --> 04:18:40.439 align:start position:0%
review and if I know that this bill
 
04:18:42.790 --> 04:18:42.800 align:start position:0%
Beyond suggesting who has the right to
 
04:18:45.030 --> 04:18:45.040 align:start position:0%
to perform eye surgery has the
 
04:18:47.349 --> 04:18:47.359 align:start position:0%
unintended consequence of creating a
 
04:18:49.870 --> 04:18:49.880 align:start position:0%
paradigm shift in who can perform
 
04:18:52.070 --> 04:18:52.080 align:start position:0%
surgery of any type in effect that has
 
04:18:56.030 --> 04:18:56.040 align:start position:0%
not been discussed or considered finally
 
04:18:58.149 --> 04:18:58.159 align:start position:0%
that may be why I know that legislation
 
04:19:01.109 --> 04:19:01.119 align:start position:0%
allowing optometrist to practice surgery
 
04:19:04.550 --> 04:19:04.560 align:start position:0%
such as we are discussing now has failed
 
04:19:06.990 --> 04:19:07.000 align:start position:0%
112 times since
 
04:19:09.910 --> 04:19:09.920 align:start position:0%
2012 and no state in the Northeast
 
04:19:12.469 --> 04:19:12.479 align:start position:0%

on House Bill
 
04:21:46.870 --> 04:21:46.880 align:start position:0%
1413 are you ready for the
 
04:21:49.910 --> 04:21:49.920 align:start position:0%
question and recognize this I recognize

Maguire thank you Mr Speaker on House
 
04:21:59.550 --> 04:21:59.560 align:start position:0%
Bill 13 1413 the Senate added a study
 
04:22:02.510 --> 04:22:02.520 align:start position:0%
committee on barriers to Mental Health
 
04:22:05.469 --> 04:22:05.479 align:start position:0%
Access now normally I'm not a fan of
 
04:22:08.630 --> 04:22:08.640 align:start position:0%
study committees and and I'm very glad
 
04:22:10.109 --> 04:22:10.119 align:start position:0%
that this one does not include a
 
04:22:13.429 --> 04:22:13.439 align:start position:0%
mandatory member from Edna but when we
 
04:22:17.229 --> 04:22:17.239 align:start position:0%
were hearing this bill we found out that
 
04:22:20.670 --> 04:22:20.680 align:start position:0%
the statutes were being read differently
 
04:22:23.469 --> 04:22:23.479 align:start position:0%
by different people that what the
 
04:22:25.950 --> 04:22:25.960 align:start position:0%
insurance companies interpreted wasn't
 
04:22:28.750 --> 04:22:28.760 align:start position:0%
always what the board interpreted and
 
04:22:30.550 --> 04:22:30.560 align:start position:0%
what or what the professionals
 
04:22:33.309 --> 04:22:33.319 align:start position:0%
interpreted so I think this is an area
 
04:22:36.630 --> 04:22:36.640 align:start position:0%
that could actually use some study and I
 
04:22:39.630 --> 04:22:39.640 align:start position:0%
hope that you all agree and they made no
 
04:22:42.590 --> 04:22:42.600 align:start position:0%
changes to the rest of the bill just add
 
04:22:45.149 --> 04:22:45.159 align:start position:0%
of the study
 
04:22:47.870 --> 04:22:47.880 align:start position:0%
committee motion before us is to concur

motion thank you Mr Speaker other than
 
04:23:39.109 --> 04:23:39.119 align:start position:0%
some minor language changes the main
 
04:23:41.469 --> 04:23:41.479 align:start position:0%
difference to the that the Senate made
 
04:23:43.349 --> 04:23:43.359 align:start position:0%
to this bill was
 
04:23:46.550 --> 04:23:46.560 align:start position:0%
to extend the terms of the board of tax
 
04:23:49.149 --> 04:23:49.159 align:start position:0%
and land appeals to five years which
 
04:23:51.469 --> 04:23:51.479 align:start position:0%
they used to be rather than the current
 
04:23:53.630 --> 04:23:53.640 align:start position:0%
three years that's something we
 
04:23:56.910 --> 04:23:56.920 align:start position:0%
discussed in committee but I have to say
 
04:23:58.590 --> 04:23:58.600 align:start position:0%
nobody thought it was important enough
 
04:24:00.870 --> 04:24:00.880 align:start position:0%
to actually write an amendment so we
 
04:24:03.429 --> 04:24:03.439 align:start position:0%
didn't pass it the Senate thought
 
04:24:05.950 --> 04:24:05.960 align:start position:0%
differently but we can't argue with that
 
04:24:09.309 --> 04:24:09.319 align:start position:0%
position and I hope you will support it
 
04:24:11.550 --> 04:24:11.560 align:start position:0%

membership of this this uh commission
 
04:24:59.670 --> 04:24:59.680 align:start position:0%
and uh expanded their scope a bit and
 
04:25:02.309 --> 04:25:02.319 align:start position:0%
fixed the Quorum because the commission
 
04:25:04.910 --> 04:25:04.920 align:start position:0%
has been unable to meet effectively for
 
04:25:07.790 --> 04:25:07.800 align:start position:0%
years because they haven't been able to
 
04:25:09.910 --> 04:25:09.920 align:start position:0%
get a proper Quorum there aren't enough
 
04:25:09.920 --> 04:25:10.990 align:start position:0%

appointed and in place to have a meeting
 
04:25:17.149 --> 04:25:17.159 align:start position:0%
so the Senate instead of just killing
 
04:25:19.550 --> 04:25:19.560 align:start position:0%
this bill which was their first choice
 
04:25:22.109 --> 04:25:22.119 align:start position:0%
decided to remove everything except the
 
04:25:26.710 --> 04:25:26.720 align:start position:0%
Quorum fix so all this bill does now is
 
04:25:29.469 --> 04:25:29.479 align:start position:0%
give this commission an effective Quorum
 
04:25:32.109 --> 04:25:32.119 align:start position:0%

04:25:34.670 --> 04:25:34.680 align:start position:0%

gayos they attempted similar legislation
 
04:39:48.750 --> 04:39:48.760 align:start position:0%
last year and another attempt will be
 
04:39:51.990 --> 04:39:52.000 align:start position:0%
voted on again this July the impetus for
 
04:39:54.670 --> 04:39:54.680 align:start position:0%
the similar New Mexico bill was a baby
 
04:39:57.628 --> 04:39:57.638 align:start position:0%
who had been discovered in a dumpster
 
04:40:01.310 --> 04:40:01.320 align:start position:0%
the baby's mother bagged the child put
 
04:40:03.670 --> 04:40:03.680 align:start position:0%
it in a trash bag and covered it with
 
04:40:05.910 --> 04:40:05.920 align:start position:0%
and it was tossed into the dumpster and
 
04:40:09.270 --> 04:40:09.280 align:start position:0%
covered with more trash a dumpster diver
 
04:40:11.708 --> 04:40:11.718 align:start position:0%
heard the infant cry and called the the
 
04:40:15.628 --> 04:40:15.638 align:start position:0%
police that baby is still alive today
 
04:40:17.350 --> 04:40:17.360 align:start position:0%
how much more Humane would it have been
 
04:40:19.310 --> 04:40:19.320 align:start position:0%
for that baby to be deposited in an
 
04:40:22.110 --> 04:40:22.120 align:start position:0%
infant safety device it is a miracle
 
04:40:24.350 --> 04:40:24.360 align:start position:0%
that that baby was discovered at all let
 
04:40:27.430 --> 04:40:27.440 align:start position:0%
alone recovered alive if we continue to
 
04:40:29.110 --> 04:40:29.120 align:start position:0%
deter and block parents from
 
04:40:30.948 --> 04:40:30.958 align:start position:0%
surrendering their babies
 
04:40:34.270 --> 04:40:34.280 align:start position:0%
alive babies like this this one will
 
04:40:36.670 --> 04:40:36.680 align:start position:0%
simply disappear we will have more
 
04:40:38.310 --> 04:40:38.320 align:start position:0%
babies like the Eckersley baby in
 
04:40:40.590 --> 04:40:40.600 align:start position:0%
Manchester more babies like meline
 
04:40:42.868 --> 04:40:42.878 align:start position:0%
kitner and sorth who was suffocated in a
 
04:40:45.788 --> 04:40:45.798 align:start position:0%
meth Den not one opponent of the
 
04:40:47.670 --> 04:40:47.680 align:start position:0%
exclusionary rule will answer the
 
04:40:50.030 --> 04:40:50.040 align:start position:0%
question of what will
 
04:40:53.510 --> 04:40:53.520 align:start position:0%
happen to the next doofan baby when his
 
04:40:56.390 --> 04:40:56.400 align:start position:0%
parents cannot safely surrender
 
04:41:00.030 --> 04:41:00.040 align:start position:0%
him the answer is really
 
04:41:02.070 --> 04:41:02.080 align:start position:0%
unspeakable infants are the most
 
04:41:04.750 --> 04:41:04.760 align:start position:0%
vulnerable people in our society if we
 
04:41:06.628 --> 04:41:06.638 align:start position:0%
continue to hunt down and prosecute
 
04:41:09.070 --> 04:41:09.080 align:start position:0%
parents who use our safe havens these
 
04:41:10.868 --> 04:41:10.878 align:start position:0%
babies cannot get up and go to another
 
04:41:13.990 --> 04:41:14.000 align:start position:0%
state with better safe haven laws all of
 
04:41:17.070 --> 04:41:17.080 align:start position:0%
us in this room are their last and only
 
04:41:20.350 --> 04:41:20.360 align:start position:0%
line of defense an exclusionary rule is
 
04:41:22.550 --> 04:41:22.560 align:start position:0%
the only way to allow this our safe
 
04:41:25.230 --> 04:41:25.240 align:start position:0%
haven law to work other states are
 
04:41:27.788 --> 04:41:27.798 align:start position:0%
coming to grips with the same issue and
 
04:41:30.430 --> 04:41:30.440 align:start position:0%
New Mexico is looking to New Hampshire
 
04:41:33.150 --> 04:41:33.160 align:start position:0%
to lead the way in protecting the mother
 
04:41:35.990 --> 04:41:36.000 align:start position:0%

04:41:52.910 --> 04:41:52.920 align:start position:0%
Speaker I'm just going to try to address
 
04:41:54.948 --> 04:41:54.958 align:start position:0%
a number of the questions and concerns
 
04:41:57.830 --> 04:41:57.840 align:start position:0%
that have been expressed about hp67
 
04:42:00.110 --> 04:42:00.120 align:start position:0%
during its journey through the house and
 
04:42:03.030 --> 04:42:03.040 align:start position:0%
the Senate uh as as as it's been
 
04:42:05.910 --> 04:42:05.920 align:start position:0%
indicated House Bill 16007 expand Safe
 
04:42:07.990 --> 04:42:08.000 align:start position:0%
Haven surrender protections for infants
 
04:42:10.190 --> 04:42:10.200 align:start position:0%
by number one allowing the use of an
 
04:42:12.230 --> 04:42:12.240 align:start position:0%
infant safety device for surrender of a
 
04:42:15.430 --> 04:42:15.440 align:start position:0%
child number two expanding the age from
 
04:42:18.230 --> 04:42:18.240 align:start position:0%
up to seven days from up to seven days
 
04:42:21.510 --> 04:42:21.520 align:start position:0%
to up to 61 days of age and number three
 
04:42:23.070 --> 04:42:23.080 align:start position:0%
clarifying protections for the
 
04:42:26.390 --> 04:42:26.400 align:start position:0%
surrendering individual to preclude any
 
04:42:28.350 --> 04:42:28.360 align:start position:0%
using any information directly gained
 
04:42:31.750 --> 04:42:31.760 align:start position:0%
from the act of the a child surrender to
 
04:42:34.670 --> 04:42:34.680 align:start position:0%
be used as evidence of a crime or
 
04:42:36.788 --> 04:42:36.798 align:start position:0%
wrongdoing questions been asked why is
 
04:42:38.788 --> 04:42:38.798 align:start position:0%
such a bill needed our current
 
04:42:41.190 --> 04:42:41.200 align:start position:0%
legislation is two decades old and needs
 
04:42:43.708 --> 04:42:43.718 align:start position:0%
to be updated specifically to expand the
 
04:42:46.430 --> 04:42:46.440 align:start position:0%
age limit in line with other states and
 
04:42:48.230 --> 04:42:48.240 align:start position:0%
to promote the anonymous surrender of
 
04:42:50.030 --> 04:42:50.040 align:start position:0%
children to ensure their highest and
 
04:42:52.990 --> 04:42:53.000 align:start position:0%
best chance of survival now the question
 
04:42:54.868 --> 04:42:54.878 align:start position:0%
is does this method of surrender
 
04:42:57.830 --> 04:42:57.840 align:start position:0%
actually save lives and the answer is
 
04:43:00.350 --> 04:43:00.360 align:start position:0%
yes while it is difficult to know how
 
04:43:02.390 --> 04:43:02.400 align:start position:0%
many because of a lack of official
 
04:43:05.190 --> 04:43:05.200 align:start position:0%
statistics and confidentiality rules
 
04:43:06.910 --> 04:43:06.920 align:start position:0%
there have been some notable examples
 
04:43:08.910 --> 04:43:08.920 align:start position:0%
that were covered in local and National
 
04:43:11.350 --> 04:43:11.360 align:start position:0%
media what we do know is that by
 
04:43:13.510 --> 04:43:13.520 align:start position:0%
reinforcing the protections and widening
 
04:43:16.430 --> 04:43:16.440 align:start position:0%
eligibility criteria even more children
 
04:43:19.510 --> 04:43:19.520 align:start position:0%
would likely be saved now the question
 
04:43:22.110 --> 04:43:22.120 align:start position:0%
why aren't we letting criminals Go free
 
04:43:24.230 --> 04:43:24.240 align:start position:0%
by not investigating and pursuing
 
04:43:26.150 --> 04:43:26.160 align:start position:0%
prosecution for wrongdoing and I know
 
04:43:28.190 --> 04:43:28.200 align:start position:0%
this is a huge concern and probably the
 
04:43:30.590 --> 04:43:30.600 align:start position:0%
biggest this is a matter of weighing a
 
04:43:32.590 --> 04:43:32.600 align:start position:0%
child's life against the single Avenue
 
04:43:35.550 --> 04:43:35.560 align:start position:0%
of evidence this concept is routinely
 
04:43:37.868 --> 04:43:37.878 align:start position:0%
applied in the law to ensure needed
 
04:43:41.310 --> 04:43:41.320 align:start position:0%
protections are in place yes it is a tra
 
04:43:43.070 --> 04:43:43.080 align:start position:0%
off but the life of a child is well
 
04:43:45.430 --> 04:43:45.440 align:start position:0%
worth it we only need to look at the
 
04:43:48.430 --> 04:43:48.440 align:start position:0%
case of Danielle Doan an abusive mother
 
04:43:50.430 --> 04:43:50.440 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire who was arrested as a
 
04:43:52.868 --> 04:43:52.878 align:start position:0%
result of a child surrender to
 
04:43:53.830 --> 04:43:53.840 align:start position:0%
understand the value of this
 
04:43:56.310 --> 04:43:56.320 align:start position:0%
exclusionary rule she used the safe
 
04:43:58.110 --> 04:43:58.120 align:start position:0%
haven law because she thought she could
 
04:44:00.990 --> 04:44:01.000 align:start position:0%
do it anonymously the resulting
 
04:44:02.590 --> 04:44:02.600 align:start position:0%
prosecutions and a very different
 
04:44:04.750 --> 04:44:04.760 align:start position:0%
message that could very well disway the
 
04:44:07.470 --> 04:44:07.480 align:start position:0%
next ofan a unless we act to protect
 
04:44:07.480 --> 04:44:08.470 align:start position:0%
next ofan a unless we act to protect
these

04:44:08.470 --> 04:44:08.480 align:start position:0%
these
 
04:44:10.670 --> 04:44:10.680 align:start position:0%
children notably the New Hampshire
 
04:44:12.430 --> 04:44:12.440 align:start position:0%
associ assciation of criminal defense
 
04:44:14.750 --> 04:44:14.760 align:start position:0%
attorneys supports the exclusionary
 
04:44:17.708 --> 04:44:17.718 align:start position:0%
provision as an effective harm reduction
 
04:44:19.948 --> 04:44:19.958 align:start position:0%
measure they have also clarify the
 
04:44:22.708 --> 04:44:22.718 align:start position:0%
exclusionary provision does not preclude
 
04:44:25.030 --> 04:44:25.040 align:start position:0%
prosecution what it does is restrict
 
04:44:26.868 --> 04:44:26.878 align:start position:0%
prosecutors from using the specific
 
04:44:29.470 --> 04:44:29.480 align:start position:0%
Avenue for evidence and requires them to
 
04:44:32.750 --> 04:44:32.760 align:start position:0%
use other evidentiary sources and tools
 
04:44:34.708 --> 04:44:34.718 align:start position:0%
in their February 29th letter to the
 
04:44:36.230 --> 04:44:36.240 align:start position:0%
house Health and Human Services and
 
04:44:38.350 --> 04:44:38.360 align:start position:0%
elderly Affairs committee the
 
04:44:41.670 --> 04:44:41.680 align:start position:0%
association stated and I quote the safe
 
04:44:44.430 --> 04:44:44.440 align:start position:0%
haven exclusionary rule proposed here is
 
04:44:46.230 --> 04:44:46.240 align:start position:0%
similar to the drug overdose Good
 
04:44:48.788 --> 04:44:48.798 align:start position:0%
Samaritan law that was enacted in
 
04:44:51.470 --> 04:44:51.480 align:start position:0%
2015 that protects both the victim of an
 
04:44:54.110 --> 04:44:54.120 align:start position:0%
overdose and a witness who requests
 
04:44:56.550 --> 04:44:56.560 align:start position:0%
medical assistance the goal of the
 
04:45:00.030 --> 04:45:00.040 align:start position:0%
exclusionary rule proposed in hb67 is
 
04:45:03.470 --> 04:45:03.480 align:start position:0%
simple to incentivize Medical Care and
 
04:45:06.070 --> 04:45:06.080 align:start position:0%
intervention rather than prosecution
 
04:45:08.788 --> 04:45:08.798 align:start position:0%
harm reduction is sound Humane public
 
04:45:11.590 --> 04:45:11.600 align:start position:0%
policy end quote
 
04:45:13.070 --> 04:45:13.080 align:start position:0%
another question is the surrender
 
04:45:16.470 --> 04:45:16.480 align:start position:0%
process safe previously our stfe our
 
04:45:18.628 --> 04:45:18.638 align:start position:0%
safe haven law allowed only for direct
 
04:45:21.150 --> 04:45:21.160 align:start position:0%
surrender to an individual by
 
04:45:23.110 --> 04:45:23.120 align:start position:0%
introducing the option of an infant
 
04:45:25.550 --> 04:45:25.560 align:start position:0%
safety device sometimes called a baby
 
04:45:28.270 --> 04:45:28.280 align:start position:0%
box parents may be encouraged by the
 
04:45:31.110 --> 04:45:31.120 align:start position:0%
extra layer of anonymity the infant
 
04:45:33.670 --> 04:45:33.680 align:start position:0%
safety device is a rigorously tested
 
04:45:36.788 --> 04:45:36.798 align:start position:0%
mechanism that is designed specifically
 
04:45:40.110 --> 04:45:40.120 align:start position:0%
to safely accept delivery of a child is
 
04:45:42.110 --> 04:45:42.120 align:start position:0%
located in inside a facility that is
 
04:45:45.628 --> 04:45:45.638 align:start position:0%
staffed 24 hours a day such as a fire
 
04:45:48.030 --> 04:45:48.040 align:start position:0%
station or a hospital and it's equipped
 
04:45:50.030 --> 04:45:50.040 align:start position:0%
with an alarm that promptly notifies
 
04:45:52.070 --> 04:45:52.080 align:start position:0%
Personnel that a child has been
 
04:45:54.190 --> 04:45:54.200 align:start position:0%
surrendered these devices have been in
 
04:45:57.190 --> 04:45:57.200 align:start position:0%
use across the country since 2016 with
 
04:46:00.708 --> 04:46:00.718 align:start position:0%
no issues no infant safety device in any
 
04:46:03.030 --> 04:46:03.040 align:start position:0%
state in America has ever harmed a child
 
04:46:05.788 --> 04:46:05.798 align:start position:0%
in any way and finally what is the
 
04:46:08.590 --> 04:46:08.600 align:start position:0%
threat pictured for children in New
 
04:46:10.628 --> 04:46:10.638 align:start position:0%
Hampshire each year in New Hampshire
 
04:46:12.590 --> 04:46:12.600 align:start position:0%
there are are thousands of cases related
 
04:46:15.270 --> 04:46:15.280 align:start position:0%
to child abuse or neglect and these are
 
04:46:17.948 --> 04:46:17.958 align:start position:0%
just a percentage of the true picture
 
04:46:19.948 --> 04:46:19.958 align:start position:0%
many of these cases are fueled by drug
 
04:46:22.550 --> 04:46:22.560 align:start position:0%
and alcohol abuse New Hampshire ranks
 
04:46:24.270 --> 04:46:24.280 align:start position:0%
among the highest in both drug and
 
04:46:26.948 --> 04:46:26.958 align:start position:0%
alcohol use children are often the
 
04:46:29.350 --> 04:46:29.360 align:start position:0%
Forgotten victims many living in
 
04:46:32.230 --> 04:46:32.240 align:start position:0%
seriously degraded and neglectful
 
04:46:34.430 --> 04:46:34.440 align:start position:0%
circumstances giving parents a wider
 
04:46:36.910 --> 04:46:36.920 align:start position:0%
window and removing every potential
 
04:46:38.708 --> 04:46:38.718 align:start position:0%
barrier to surrendering unwanted
 
04:46:40.990 --> 04:46:41.000 align:start position:0%
children could provide desperately
 
04:46:42.868 --> 04:46:42.878 align:start position:0%
needed safety and protection for
 
04:46:45.910 --> 04:46:45.920 align:start position:0%
children unable to speak or care for
 
04:46:48.110 --> 04:46:48.120 align:start position:0%
themselves and for this reason we ask
 
04:46:50.150 --> 04:46:50.160 align:start position:0%
that you
 
04:46:52.270 --> 04:46:52.280 align:start position:0%
concur representative Seth Kings
 
04:46:58.548 --> 04:46:58.558 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:00.670 --> 04:47:00.680 align:start position:0%
recommendation one moment
 
04:47:02.830 --> 04:47:02.840 align:start position:0%
please representative McDonald does a
 
04:47:05.750 --> 04:47:05.760 align:start position:0%
member yield for a question yes the
 
04:47:11.230 --> 04:47:11.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:13.948 --> 04:47:13.958 align:start position:0%
thank you representative um we have
 
04:47:17.070 --> 04:47:17.080 align:start position:0%
heard that uh there is no other state in
 
04:47:21.030 --> 04:47:21.040 align:start position:0%
the nation that has a language such as
 
04:47:22.990 --> 04:47:23.000 align:start position:0%
in the Senate Amendment for the
 
04:47:26.030 --> 04:47:26.040 align:start position:0%
exclusionary rule as you put it do you
 
04:47:31.270 --> 04:47:31.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:33.708 --> 04:47:33.718 align:start position:0%
case I think at least one reason for
 
04:47:35.868 --> 04:47:35.878 align:start position:0%
that is the fact that no other state has
 
04:47:38.510 --> 04:47:38.520 align:start position:0%
used police to investigate and prosecute
 
04:47:41.110 --> 04:47:41.120 align:start position:0%
a parent surrendering a baby but we have
 
04:47:42.910 --> 04:47:42.920 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire and this is the reason
 
04:47:45.350 --> 04:47:45.360 align:start position:0%
we need to concur with the Senate we
 
04:47:48.270 --> 04:47:48.280 align:start position:0%
need to encourage parents in crisis to
 
04:47:50.708 --> 04:47:50.718 align:start position:0%
safely surrender their baby and this can
 
04:47:52.788 --> 04:47:52.798 align:start position:0%
literally save
 
04:47:55.030 --> 04:47:55.040 align:start position:0%
lives sorry about that representative
 
04:47:57.470 --> 04:47:57.480 align:start position:0%
King you're
 
04:47:59.948 --> 04:47:59.958 align:start position:0%
up thank you Mr Speaker esteemed
 
04:48:01.990 --> 04:48:02.000 align:start position:0%
colleagues uh a lot of time has already
 
04:48:04.150 --> 04:48:04.160 align:start position:0%
been spent on trying to sell us on the
 
04:48:07.270 --> 04:48:07.280 align:start position:0%
baby box idea uh we're already sold on
 
04:48:09.548 --> 04:48:09.558 align:start position:0%
the baby box idea when this came before
 
04:48:11.548 --> 04:48:11.558 align:start position:0%
us a couple months ago split the bill in
 
04:48:16.190 --> 04:48:16.200 align:start position:0%
two we voted on the baby box 373 to1 uh
 
04:48:17.910 --> 04:48:17.920 align:start position:0%
overwhelmingly support it's the
 
04:48:20.070 --> 04:48:20.080 align:start position:0%
exclusionary role that was extremely
 
04:48:23.750 --> 04:48:23.760 align:start position:0%
divisive uh we killed it here I spoke
 
04:48:25.830 --> 04:48:25.840 align:start position:0%
before the Judiciary Committee on the
 
04:48:28.948 --> 04:48:28.958 align:start position:0%
other body uh against the adding the
 
04:48:30.990 --> 04:48:31.000 align:start position:0%
exclusionary rule we had uh
 
04:48:32.548 --> 04:48:32.558 align:start position:0%
representatives from the Departments of
 
04:48:34.548 --> 04:48:34.558 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services and Justice
 
04:48:36.350 --> 04:48:36.360 align:start position:0%
speaking against adding the exclusionary
 
04:48:39.470 --> 04:48:39.480 align:start position:0%
rule unfortunately it was added in a
 
04:48:41.868 --> 04:48:41.878 align:start position:0%
strictly partisan manner
 
04:48:44.110 --> 04:48:44.120 align:start position:0%
uh and then when it went before the
 
04:48:46.590 --> 04:48:46.600 align:start position:0%
entire body it was also passed on in a
 
04:48:48.910 --> 04:48:48.920 align:start position:0%
strictly partisan manner so you might be
 
04:48:51.670 --> 04:48:51.680 align:start position:0%
asking Seth why are you going against
 
04:48:53.910 --> 04:48:53.920 align:start position:0%
your party on this issue and I would say
 
04:48:55.590 --> 04:48:55.600 align:start position:0%
I'm not going against my party on this
 
04:48:57.830 --> 04:48:57.840 align:start position:0%
issue I'm standing with all of the other
 
04:49:00.230 --> 04:49:00.240 align:start position:0%
Republicans around the country who have
 
04:49:02.670 --> 04:49:02.680 align:start position:0%
passed Safe Haven laws and did not add
 
04:49:05.990 --> 04:49:06.000 align:start position:0%
an exclusionary rule okay there are 2 22
 
04:49:07.470 --> 04:49:07.480 align:start position:0%
states that have passed the safe the
 
04:49:09.868 --> 04:49:09.878 align:start position:0%
safe haven boxes all right we've got a
 
04:49:11.430 --> 04:49:11.440 align:start position:0%
few blue States like like Maryland and
 
04:49:13.070 --> 04:49:13.080 align:start position:0%
New Mexico we've got some purple States
 
04:49:14.788 --> 04:49:14.798 align:start position:0%
like Maine and Montana but the
 
04:49:16.868 --> 04:49:16.878 align:start position:0%
overwhelming majority of them are deep
 
04:49:18.708 --> 04:49:18.718 align:start position:0%
red States we're talking Alabama
 
04:49:22.430 --> 04:49:22.440 align:start position:0%
Missouri Mississippi Arkansas okay the
 
04:49:24.750 --> 04:49:24.760 align:start position:0%
Republicans in those States could have
 
04:49:26.670 --> 04:49:26.680 align:start position:0%
easily passed an exclusionary rule
 
04:49:28.310 --> 04:49:28.320 align:start position:0%
without any help from the Democrats so
 
04:49:29.910 --> 04:49:29.920 align:start position:0%
we can't blame the Democrats on killing
 
04:49:31.750 --> 04:49:31.760 align:start position:0%
the exclusionary rule the Republicans
 
04:49:34.470 --> 04:49:34.480 align:start position:0%
around the country have decided that
 
04:49:37.070 --> 04:49:37.080 align:start position:0%
they did not need to add an exclusionary
 
04:49:39.070 --> 04:49:39.080 align:start position:0%
rule in order to get the benefits of the
 
04:49:41.830 --> 04:49:41.840 align:start position:0%
baby boxes okay it's the New Hampshire
 
04:49:43.430 --> 04:49:43.440 align:start position:0%
Republicans that have decided to add
 
04:49:46.110 --> 04:49:46.120 align:start position:0%
this language much to my sugrin because
 
04:49:48.750 --> 04:49:48.760 align:start position:0%
I also supported the baby box idea so
 
04:49:51.708 --> 04:49:51.718 align:start position:0%
what I recommend is this year we do not
 
04:49:54.708 --> 04:49:54.718 align:start position:0%
concur in six months the sponsors of the
 
04:49:56.990 --> 04:49:57.000 align:start position:0%
bill can bring back the baby box Bill
 
04:50:00.110 --> 04:50:00.120 align:start position:0%
hopefully they will not include the that
 
04:50:02.390 --> 04:50:02.400 align:start position:0%
extra part of the exclusionary rule and
 
04:50:04.110 --> 04:50:04.120 align:start position:0%
it'll sail through both bodies get
 
04:50:05.868 --> 04:50:05.878 align:start position:0%
signed in the corner office and we can
 
04:50:07.948 --> 04:50:07.958 align:start position:0%
all go our merry way but but this
 
04:50:10.868 --> 04:50:10.878 align:start position:0%
exclusionary rule is just it's just way
 
04:50:13.430 --> 04:50:13.440 align:start position:0%
too far uh I cannot support and I know
 
04:50:15.510 --> 04:50:15.520 align:start position:0%
there are many New Hampshire citizens
 
04:50:17.910 --> 04:50:17.920 align:start position:0%
who would feel very uncomfortable about
 
04:50:21.830 --> 04:50:21.840 align:start position:0%
giving deao immunity to Baby rapists so
 
04:50:25.230 --> 04:50:25.240 align:start position:0%
please vote to not concur thank you does
 
04:50:27.948 --> 04:50:27.958 align:start position:0%
the member yield for a question member
 
04:50:29.590 --> 04:50:29.600 align:start position:0%
does not yield representative Mark
 
04:50:33.390 --> 04:50:33.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:35.548 --> 04:50:35.558 align:start position:0%
recommendation thank you Mr Speaker and
 
04:50:38.310 --> 04:50:38.320 align:start position:0%
I will keep my remarks only on the
 
04:50:41.270 --> 04:50:41.280 align:start position:0%
subject of the exclusionary rule
 
04:50:42.628 --> 04:50:42.638 align:start position:0%
consider two
 
04:50:45.510 --> 04:50:45.520 align:start position:0%
parallels a police officer believes in a
 
04:50:48.430 --> 04:50:48.440 align:start position:0%
particular dwelling there are items
 
04:50:51.990 --> 04:50:52.000 align:start position:0%
proving the bad guy is a bad guy so the
 
04:50:54.310 --> 04:50:54.320 align:start position:0%
police officer goes in there takes those
 
04:50:57.030 --> 04:50:57.040 align:start position:0%
items the judge throws them out because
 
04:50:58.270 --> 04:50:58.280 align:start position:0%
there was no
 
04:51:01.670 --> 04:51:01.680 align:start position:0%
warrant Well we'd like to pin it on the
 
04:51:04.390 --> 04:51:04.400 align:start position:0%
bad guy but I think we realize the
 
04:51:07.788 --> 04:51:07.798 align:start position:0%
sanctity of our homes from unwarranted
 
04:51:07.798 --> 04:51:09.548 align:start position:0%
sanctity of our homes from unwarranted
police

04:51:09.548 --> 04:51:09.558 align:start position:0%
police
 
04:51:12.030 --> 04:51:12.040 align:start position:0%
invasion overrules this I think it's a
 
04:51:15.430 --> 04:51:15.440 align:start position:0%
freedom issue and secondly a court case
 
04:51:18.948 --> 04:51:18.958 align:start position:0%
in this state a judge demanded a physici
 
04:51:21.390 --> 04:51:21.400 align:start position:0%
violate the doctor patient
 
04:51:24.750 --> 04:51:24.760 align:start position:0%
confidentiality to obtain needed
 
04:51:28.590 --> 04:51:28.600 align:start position:0%
information and if you like me are a fan
 
04:51:31.190 --> 04:51:31.200 align:start position:0%
of reading through Rules of Evidence
 
04:51:34.230 --> 04:51:34.240 align:start position:0%
you'll discover in 502 in the
 
04:51:37.150 --> 04:51:37.160 align:start position:0%
footnote it was reversed upon appeal
 
04:51:39.590 --> 04:51:39.600 align:start position:0%
because the state had not done due
 
04:51:42.030 --> 04:51:42.040 align:start position:0%
diligence to get the information they
 
04:51:46.110 --> 04:51:46.120 align:start position:0%
needed in ways other than violating Dr
 
04:51:46.120 --> 04:51:47.548 align:start position:0%
needed in ways other than violating Dr
patient

04:51:47.548 --> 04:51:47.558 align:start position:0%
patient
 
04:51:49.548 --> 04:51:49.558 align:start position:0%
confidentiality and again to me this is
 
04:51:53.390 --> 04:51:53.400 align:start position:0%
a freedom issue so what we have is the
 
04:51:57.390 --> 04:51:57.400 align:start position:0%
greater good of that baby being spared
 
04:52:01.670 --> 04:52:01.680 align:start position:0%
over one way of pinning things on the
 
04:52:04.788 --> 04:52:04.798 align:start position:0%
bad guys things that the States state
 
04:52:08.708 --> 04:52:08.718 align:start position:0%
can do with a rigorous policing action
 
04:52:11.548 --> 04:52:11.558 align:start position:0%
so please vote Yes vote vote green vote
 
04:52:13.350 --> 04:52:13.360 align:start position:0%
for the
 
04:52:15.590 --> 04:52:15.600 align:start position:0%

P questions on the motion to Concur and
 
04:54:07.270 --> 04:54:07.280 align:start position:0%
House Bill 16007 representative Weber is
 
04:54:11.270 --> 04:54:11.280 align:start position:0%
recognized for parliamentary inquiry
 
04:54:14.548 --> 04:54:14.558 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker if I know that
 
04:54:17.830 --> 04:54:17.840 align:start position:0%
parents May safely surrender a baby
 
04:54:21.350 --> 04:54:21.360 align:start position:0%
today in a number of different
 
04:54:26.070 --> 04:54:26.080 align:start position:0%
ways and if I know that I do not want to
 
04:54:31.750 --> 04:54:31.760 align:start position:0%
potentially allow 61 days of child abuse
 
04:54:35.350 --> 04:54:35.360 align:start position:0%
and then giving a get out of jail free
 
04:54:39.830 --> 04:54:39.840 align:start position:0%
pass to that abuser would I now vote no
 
04:54:41.750 --> 04:54:41.760 align:start position:0%
on the incur
 
04:54:44.070 --> 04:54:44.080 align:start position:0%
motion representative lind's recognized
 
04:54:47.830 --> 04:54:47.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:50.548 --> 04:54:50.558 align:start position:0%
inquiry thank you Mr Speaker if I know
 
04:54:52.510 --> 04:54:52.520 align:start position:0%
that parents to willing to leave their
 
04:54:55.670 --> 04:54:55.680 align:start position:0%
babies with a stranger or in a box are
 
04:54:57.628 --> 04:54:57.638 align:start position:0%
very likely involved in criminal
 
04:55:00.390 --> 04:55:00.400 align:start position:0%
activity against their child and if I
 
04:55:03.070 --> 04:55:03.080 align:start position:0%
know that right now such parents who use
 
04:55:05.948 --> 04:55:05.958 align:start position:0%
our safe haven law can expect to be
 
04:55:07.868 --> 04:55:07.878 align:start position:0%
arrested as a result of surrendering
 
04:55:10.470 --> 04:55:10.480 align:start position:0%
their baby and if I know that unless
 
04:55:13.110 --> 04:55:13.120 align:start position:0%
this changes there is no real incentive
 
04:55:16.030 --> 04:55:16.040 align:start position:0%
to use the safe haven law and if I know
 
04:55:20.788 --> 04:55:20.798 align:start position:0%
that hp67 grants use immunity only and
 
04:55:22.390 --> 04:55:22.400 align:start position:0%
does not Grant what's called
 
04:55:24.430 --> 04:55:24.440 align:start position:0%
transactional immunity that is somebody
 
04:55:27.030 --> 04:55:27.040 align:start position:0%
that surrenders their baby can still be
 
04:55:29.270 --> 04:55:29.280 align:start position:0%
prosecuted if they've if they've abused
 
04:55:32.030 --> 04:55:32.040 align:start position:0%
the child based on evidence independent
 
04:55:35.190 --> 04:55:35.200 align:start position:0%
of the surrender um and finally if I
 
04:55:37.628 --> 04:55:37.638 align:start position:0%
know that forcing a violent abusive
 
04:55:40.830 --> 04:55:40.840 align:start position:0%
parent to keep his or her baby
 
04:55:43.990 --> 04:55:44.000 align:start position:0%
uh will will result in very bad outcomes
 
04:55:46.390 --> 04:55:46.400 align:start position:0%
for the child then would I now press the
 
04:55:48.948 --> 04:55:48.958 align:start position:0%
green button to pass this life saving
 
04:55:50.548 --> 04:55:50.558 align:start position:0%

data for use in marital applications the
 
04:59:58.948 --> 04:59:58.958 align:start position:0%
Senate did not change this part of the
 
05:00:01.310 --> 05:00:01.320 align:start position:0%
bill but it added to the bill language
 
05:00:04.548 --> 05:00:04.558 align:start position:0%
amending the Privacy Bill uh we passed
 
05:00:06.830 --> 05:00:06.840 align:start position:0%
earlier this year that is Senate Bill
 
05:00:10.708 --> 05:00:10.718 align:start position:0%
255 that bill as it passed both bodies
 
05:00:13.750 --> 05:00:13.760 align:start position:0%
uh was signed into law uh as it was
 
05:00:15.628 --> 05:00:15.638 align:start position:0%
signed into law required the Secretary
 
05:00:18.310 --> 05:00:18.320 align:start position:0%
of State to establish certain standards
 
05:00:20.948 --> 05:00:20.958 align:start position:0%
for privacy notices and for the methods
 
05:00:23.708 --> 05:00:23.718 align:start position:0%
by which uh a consumer could exercise a
 
05:00:27.150 --> 05:00:27.160 align:start position:0%
right to opt out of uh the uh Provisions
 
05:00:28.590 --> 05:00:28.600 align:start position:0%
uh that would allow his his or her
 
05:00:30.708 --> 05:00:30.718 align:start position:0%
private information to be sold the
 
05:00:33.350 --> 05:00:33.360 align:start position:0%
Senate Amendment eliminates the role of
 
05:00:36.030 --> 05:00:36.040 align:start position:0%
the Secretary of State but ads language
 
05:00:38.350 --> 05:00:38.360 align:start position:0%
requiring the notice that notices be
 
05:00:41.110 --> 05:00:41.120 align:start position:0%
available online on a mobile app or
 
05:00:43.788 --> 05:00:43.798 align:start position:0%
other on other devices regularly used by
 
05:00:46.750 --> 05:00:46.760 align:start position:0%
the consumer to interact with uh the
 
05:00:49.030 --> 05:00:49.040 align:start position:0%
company that's covered by the statute
 
05:00:50.990 --> 05:00:51.000 align:start position:0%
the Secretary of State wanted it to be
 
05:00:53.670 --> 05:00:53.680 align:start position:0%
removed wanted to be removed from having
 
05:00:56.150 --> 05:00:56.160 align:start position:0%
a role in this bill because he correctly
 
05:00:57.910 --> 05:00:57.920 align:start position:0%
points out that his office has no
 
05:01:01.230 --> 05:01:01.240 align:start position:0%
particular expertise in privacy matters
 
05:01:04.430 --> 05:01:04.440 align:start position:0%
although the Judiciary Committee is not
 
05:01:06.910 --> 05:01:06.920 align:start position:0%
thrilled with what the Senate did they
 
05:01:08.310 --> 05:01:08.320 align:start position:0%
perhaps there could have been a better
 
05:01:10.868 --> 05:01:10.878 align:start position:0%
job done um what would need to be
 
05:01:13.270 --> 05:01:13.280 align:start position:0%
changed is not is more complicated than
 
05:01:15.310 --> 05:01:15.320 align:start position:0%
could be accomplished in a committee of
 
05:01:17.310 --> 05:01:17.320 align:start position:0%
conference and on balance what the
 
05:01:19.590 --> 05:01:19.600 align:start position:0%
Senate did what the Senate did is
 
05:01:21.628 --> 05:01:21.638 align:start position:0%
acceptable and it is particularly
 
05:01:23.190 --> 05:01:23.200 align:start position:0%
important because the other aspect of
 
05:01:25.070 --> 05:01:25.080 align:start position:0%
the bill dealing with the with the
 
05:01:27.110 --> 05:01:27.120 align:start position:0%
elimination of of the rational and
 
05:01:30.110 --> 05:01:30.120 align:start position:0%
educational uh uh collection of data in
 
05:01:32.150 --> 05:01:32.160 align:start position:0%
the marriage applications is is very
 
05:01:34.390 --> 05:01:34.400 align:start position:0%
important and had strong bipartisan
 
05:01:36.430 --> 05:01:36.440 align:start position:0%
support from this body so for those
 
05:01:38.830 --> 05:01:38.840 align:start position:0%
reasons I ask that you
 
05:01:41.190 --> 05:01:41.200 align:start position:0%

05:02:00.230 --> 05:02:00.240 align:start position:0%
Senate has to concurrence to the house
 
05:02:03.190 --> 05:02:03.200 align:start position:0%
house bill 1245 relative to release of
 
05:02:04.670 --> 05:02:04.680 align:start position:0%
confidential records of a person
 
05:02:06.948 --> 05:02:06.958 align:start position:0%
appointed a guardian and relative to
 
05:02:08.830 --> 05:02:08.840 align:start position:0%

records representative Lynn moves at the
 
05:02:13.590 --> 05:02:13.600 align:start position:0%
house concur representative Nagel is
 
05:02:20.390 --> 05:02:20.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:23.510 --> 05:02:23.520 align:start position:0%
recommendation thank you Mr Speaker um
 
05:02:25.990 --> 05:02:26.000 align:start position:0%
I'm only going to be addressing the uh
 
05:02:28.470 --> 05:02:28.480 align:start position:0%
previously known Senate Bill 400 portion
 
05:02:30.910 --> 05:02:30.920 align:start position:0%
of this bill which was amended into
 
05:02:33.670 --> 05:02:33.680 align:start position:0%
1245 before I start I have a a
 
05:02:35.948 --> 05:02:35.958 align:start position:0%
confession to make I'm part of the
 
05:02:38.628 --> 05:02:38.638 align:start position:0%
problem I make a strong recommendation
 
05:02:41.628 --> 05:02:41.638 align:start position:0%
to every one of my patients that it is
 
05:02:43.670 --> 05:02:43.680 align:start position:0%
their right and their responsibility to
 
05:02:45.628 --> 05:02:45.638 align:start position:0%
get a copy of their medical records and
 
05:02:47.110 --> 05:02:47.120 align:start position:0%
that should be given to them at a
 
05:02:49.670 --> 05:02:49.680 align:start position:0%
reasonable price I think that's
 
05:02:51.868 --> 05:02:51.878 align:start position:0%
important and that's what the original
 
05:02:54.990 --> 05:02:55.000 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 400 actually said and that's
 
05:02:57.670 --> 05:02:57.680 align:start position:0%
was really exciting to me and then it
 
05:02:59.310 --> 05:02:59.320 align:start position:0%
got amended and that's when things
 
05:03:02.310 --> 05:03:02.320 align:start position:0%
started to change so the first thing
 
05:03:04.070 --> 05:03:04.080 align:start position:0%
that was done in the amendment was they
 
05:03:05.708 --> 05:03:05.718 align:start position:0%
made a change that said that the
 
05:03:07.708 --> 05:03:07.718 align:start position:0%
requestor was not just the patient or
 
05:03:10.910 --> 05:03:10.920 align:start position:0%
their estate but was also their attorney
 
05:03:12.670 --> 05:03:12.680 align:start position:0%
superficially I wasn't sure what I
 
05:03:14.110 --> 05:03:14.120 align:start position:0%
thought about that but when I thought
 
05:03:16.390 --> 05:03:16.400 align:start position:0%
more about it I realized that attorneys
 
05:03:18.590 --> 05:03:18.600 align:start position:0%
asked for these records for all sorts of
 
05:03:20.910 --> 05:03:20.920 align:start position:0%
reasons some of which are really I don't
 
05:03:22.270 --> 05:03:22.280 align:start position:0%
want to use the word honorable because
 
05:03:23.750 --> 05:03:23.760 align:start position:0%
they're all honorable but they're you
 
05:03:26.070 --> 05:03:26.080 align:start position:0%
know interested the protecting the
 
05:03:27.670 --> 05:03:27.680 align:start position:0%
patient where others of them are looking
 
05:03:29.510 --> 05:03:29.520 align:start position:0%
more for personal injury things like
 
05:03:31.470 --> 05:03:31.480 align:start position:0%
that and all of a sudden we realized
 
05:03:33.470 --> 05:03:33.480 align:start position:0%
well that needs to be discussed a lot
 
05:03:36.110 --> 05:03:36.120 align:start position:0%
more the second thing was is that they
 
05:03:38.190 --> 05:03:38.200 align:start position:0%
put in a limit to how much you could
 
05:03:40.990 --> 05:03:41.000 align:start position:0%
charge that third party for for that and
 
05:03:42.868 --> 05:03:42.878 align:start position:0%
that number was awfully low it was like
 
05:03:45.390 --> 05:03:45.400 align:start position:0%
$50 and we started thinking well maybe
 
05:03:49.070 --> 05:03:49.080 align:start position:0%
that's a problem too so we at HHS
 
05:03:51.390 --> 05:03:51.400 align:start position:0%
EA came to the conclusion that we really
 
05:03:53.390 --> 05:03:53.400 align:start position:0%
need to sit down and discuss this that
 
05:03:55.948 --> 05:03:55.958 align:start position:0%
this is not ready for prime time so we
 
05:03:58.868 --> 05:03:58.878 align:start position:0%
voted 18-2 to send this to interim study
 
05:04:01.948 --> 05:04:01.958 align:start position:0%
and You by Voice vote agreed with that
 
05:04:04.430 --> 05:04:04.440 align:start position:0%
when it went back over to the other
 
05:04:05.830 --> 05:04:05.840 align:start position:0%
whatever you want to call it on the
 
05:04:09.948 --> 05:04:09.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:14.750 --> 05:04:14.760 align:start position:0%
that thing body that thing so thank you
 
05:04:16.350 --> 05:04:16.360 align:start position:0%
when I went over there they actually did
 
05:04:18.430 --> 05:04:18.440 align:start position:0%
something really neat they they actually
 
05:04:20.270 --> 05:04:20.280 align:start position:0%
put in the sliding scale that I
 
05:04:22.430 --> 05:04:22.440 align:start position:0%
requested and I was always I was really
 
05:04:24.628 --> 05:04:24.638 align:start position:0%
excited about that but they left in the
 
05:04:26.628 --> 05:04:26.638 align:start position:0%
definition of the requester and they
 
05:04:31.990 --> 05:04:32.000 align:start position:0%
also CA the fees for um uh the for
 
05:04:35.070 --> 05:04:35.080 align:start position:0%
electronic records at $50 still and that
 
05:04:37.190 --> 05:04:37.200 align:start position:0%
that seemed problematic to me so what I
 
05:04:39.390 --> 05:04:39.400 align:start position:0%
did yesterday when I had nothing better
 
05:04:43.390 --> 05:04:43.400 align:start position:0%
to do I I live I run a I used to own a a
 
05:04:45.190 --> 05:04:45.200 align:start position:0%
very busy Medical Practice I was a
 
05:04:47.070 --> 05:04:47.080 align:start position:0%
partner in it for 34 years which I gave
 
05:04:50.430 --> 05:04:50.440 align:start position:0%
up to join all of you I went over yeah I
 
05:04:52.788 --> 05:04:52.798 align:start position:0%
when I went over there I I decided I'm
 
05:04:54.270 --> 05:04:54.280 align:start position:0%
going to spend time with the folks in
 
05:04:55.868 --> 05:04:55.878 align:start position:0%
medical records because I want to find
 
05:04:57.868 --> 05:04:57.878 align:start position:0%
out what they really do because you know
 
05:05:00.190 --> 05:05:00.200 align:start position:0%
where I do I don't have a clue so I
 
05:05:01.830 --> 05:05:01.840 align:start position:0%
spent the afternoon with them and I
 
05:05:04.030 --> 05:05:04.040 align:start position:0%
found out what was involved for them to
 
05:05:06.750 --> 05:05:06.760 align:start position:0%
satisfy these requests for records
 
05:05:08.990 --> 05:05:09.000 align:start position:0%
number one they said the number of
 
05:05:11.350 --> 05:05:11.360 align:start position:0%
record requests they get as overwhelming
 
05:05:13.830 --> 05:05:13.840 align:start position:0%
I did not know that secondly the most
 
05:05:16.030 --> 05:05:16.040 align:start position:0%
common requestor does come from third
 
05:05:19.190 --> 05:05:19.200 align:start position:0%
parties specifically attorneys third
 
05:05:21.830 --> 05:05:21.840 align:start position:0%
they need to be hippot trained before
 
05:05:23.590 --> 05:05:23.600 align:start position:0%
they can even do this job because if
 
05:05:26.350 --> 05:05:26.360 align:start position:0%
they make a mistake we get in trouble
 
05:05:29.670 --> 05:05:29.680 align:start position:0%
fourth every page that they sent has to
 
05:05:31.310 --> 05:05:31.320 align:start position:0%
be reviewed to make sure that it's
 
05:05:33.670 --> 05:05:33.680 align:start position:0%
hippoc client before they press that
 
05:05:36.390 --> 05:05:36.400 align:start position:0%
button send and that and then all of a
 
05:05:38.788 --> 05:05:38.798 align:start position:0%
sudden I started realizing this is not a
 
05:05:40.270 --> 05:05:40.280 align:start position:0%
cheap process
 
05:05:42.110 --> 05:05:42.120 align:start position:0%
so then I talked to a couple practice
 
05:05:44.750 --> 05:05:44.760 align:start position:0%
managers I said do you think this $50 is
 
05:05:47.788 --> 05:05:47.798 align:start position:0%
enough every one of them said no and I
 
05:05:49.670 --> 05:05:49.680 align:start position:0%
said well what number is enough they
 
05:05:49.680 --> 05:05:50.670 align:start position:0%
said well what number is enough they
said

05:05:50.670 --> 05:05:50.680 align:start position:0%
said
 
05:05:53.310 --> 05:05:53.320 align:start position:0%
$125 would be more reasonable and I said
 
05:05:55.270 --> 05:05:55.280 align:start position:0%
well that sounds pretty cheap to me too
 
05:05:57.548 --> 05:05:57.558 align:start position:0%
for the requests that are being put in
 
05:05:59.470 --> 05:05:59.480 align:start position:0%
so basically at this point the reason
 
05:06:01.948 --> 05:06:01.958 align:start position:0%
why I oppose the 400 section of it is we
 
05:06:04.150 --> 05:06:04.160 align:start position:0%
really need to sit down and decide what
 
05:06:06.628 --> 05:06:06.638 align:start position:0%
that attorney part of the requestor
 
05:06:08.788 --> 05:06:08.798 align:start position:0%
means should it be considered as
 
05:06:10.110 --> 05:06:10.120 align:start position:0%
separate legisl
 
05:06:12.510 --> 05:06:12.520 align:start position:0%
or should it be part of this process and
 
05:06:14.150 --> 05:06:14.160 align:start position:0%
secondly we really need to seriously
 
05:06:15.628 --> 05:06:15.638 align:start position:0%
look down and see what that dollar
 
05:06:18.270 --> 05:06:18.280 align:start position:0%
amount was until those things are done I
 
05:06:20.150 --> 05:06:20.160 align:start position:0%
really don't think this this bill is
 
05:06:22.190 --> 05:06:22.200 align:start position:0%
ready for prime time and therefore I ask
 
05:06:25.590 --> 05:06:25.600 align:start position:0%
you to not concur thank
 
05:06:28.070 --> 05:06:28.080 align:start position:0%
you representative Linds recognized to
 
05:06:32.430 --> 05:06:32.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:34.990 --> 05:06:35.000 align:start position:0%
recommendation thank you Mr Speaker uh
 
05:06:36.990 --> 05:06:37.000 align:start position:0%
colleagues just for let me just address
 
05:06:39.868 --> 05:06:39.878 align:start position:0%
what the just very briefly the non sort
 
05:06:42.990 --> 05:06:43.000 align:start position:0%
of in dispute part of this bill um that
 
05:06:44.750 --> 05:06:44.760 align:start position:0%
was the original bill that came out of
 
05:06:48.548 --> 05:06:48.558 align:start position:0%
the house it it basically extends
 
05:06:51.190 --> 05:06:51.200 align:start position:0%
further rights to somebody that's
 
05:06:53.470 --> 05:06:53.480 align:start position:0%
subject to a a guardianship that is the
 
05:06:56.990 --> 05:06:57.000 align:start position:0%
ward and it basically says that the ward
 
05:07:00.670 --> 05:07:00.680 align:start position:0%
is entitled to get his or her own uh
 
05:07:03.270 --> 05:07:03.280 align:start position:0%
records including medical records unless
 
05:07:06.470 --> 05:07:06.480 align:start position:0%
a court has specifically said that that
 
05:07:08.350 --> 05:07:08.360 align:start position:0%
would not be in the best interest of the
 
05:07:10.708 --> 05:07:10.718 align:start position:0%
ward right now now under the law that is
 
05:07:13.310 --> 05:07:13.320 align:start position:0%
not it award does not have that right
 
05:07:15.948 --> 05:07:15.958 align:start position:0%
and it's and and uh we said as we sent
 
05:07:18.230 --> 05:07:18.240 align:start position:0%
this bill to the Senate that they should
 
05:07:20.830 --> 05:07:20.840 align:start position:0%
have with regard to the issue of
 
05:07:24.110 --> 05:07:24.120 align:start position:0%
generally the Avail being able to get
 
05:07:26.590 --> 05:07:26.600 align:start position:0%
medical records which the prior speaker
 
05:07:30.350 --> 05:07:30.360 align:start position:0%
talked about I would agree with
 
05:07:33.470 --> 05:07:33.480 align:start position:0%
everything the prior speaker said if it
 
05:07:35.788 --> 05:07:35.798 align:start position:0%
weren't for one thing which I think is
 
05:07:39.548 --> 05:07:39.558 align:start position:0%
critically important and that is under
 
05:07:43.548 --> 05:07:43.558 align:start position:0%
federal law under Hippa if you are the
 
05:07:47.230 --> 05:07:47.240 align:start position:0%
patient you can get all your records all
 
05:07:50.110 --> 05:07:50.120 align:start position:0%
your medical records including all the
 
05:07:51.910 --> 05:07:51.920 align:start position:0%
work that has to be done in gathering
 
05:07:56.310 --> 05:07:56.320 align:start position:0%
that for zero for free you are entitled
 
05:07:59.910 --> 05:07:59.920 align:start position:0%
to get all your records for free and so
 
05:08:02.310 --> 05:08:02.320 align:start position:0%
the problem that I have with this whole
 
05:08:03.948 --> 05:08:03.958 align:start position:0%
and the reason that I support what the
 
05:08:05.470 --> 05:08:05.480 align:start position:0%
Senate has done
 
05:08:08.548 --> 05:08:08.558 align:start position:0%
is if you can get all your records for
 
05:08:12.430 --> 05:08:12.440 align:start position:0%
free and if you have to authorize you
 
05:08:14.310 --> 05:08:14.320 align:start position:0%
the person who's you're the patient
 
05:08:16.390 --> 05:08:16.400 align:start position:0%
anyone else including your attorney to
 
05:08:19.030 --> 05:08:19.040 align:start position:0%
be able to get the records on your
 
05:08:22.030 --> 05:08:22.040 align:start position:0%
behalf why is there any reason I I think
 
05:08:23.510 --> 05:08:23.520 align:start position:0%
an argument could be made why is there
 
05:08:26.910 --> 05:08:26.920 align:start position:0%
any reason why your agent gets charged
 
05:08:29.910 --> 05:08:29.920 align:start position:0%
at all for those records if you under
 
05:08:31.548 --> 05:08:31.558 align:start position:0%
federal law are entitled to get them for
 
05:08:34.390 --> 05:08:34.400 align:start position:0%
free but I'll put that aside let's
 
05:08:36.470 --> 05:08:36.480 align:start position:0%
assume that there's some maybe there's
 
05:08:38.590 --> 05:08:38.600 align:start position:0%
some reason for allowing some charge it
 
05:08:41.510 --> 05:08:41.520 align:start position:0%
seems to me that the that the charge
 
05:08:43.230 --> 05:08:43.240 align:start position:0%
that the charges that the Senate has
 
05:08:45.350 --> 05:08:45.360 align:start position:0%
allowed in in its proposal which are
 
05:08:47.230 --> 05:08:47.240 align:start position:0%
relatively nominal I they're not not a
 
05:08:49.830 --> 05:08:49.840 align:start position:0%
great deal of money makes perfect sense
 
05:08:52.708 --> 05:08:52.718 align:start position:0%
given that if the patient himself or
 
05:08:54.830 --> 05:08:54.840 align:start position:0%
herself wants the records there's no
 
05:08:57.150 --> 05:08:57.160 align:start position:0%
charge at all what I have to say
 
05:08:59.390 --> 05:08:59.400 align:start position:0%
honestly the flavor that you get when
 
05:09:02.230 --> 05:09:02.240 align:start position:0%
you if you think about this carefully is
 
05:09:04.548 --> 05:09:04.558 align:start position:0%
that you know if it's if it's the
 
05:09:06.788 --> 05:09:06.798 align:start position:0%
patient that wants to get their records
 
05:09:08.750 --> 05:09:08.760 align:start position:0%
then there's no problem because the
 
05:09:10.510 --> 05:09:10.520 align:start position:0%
patient you know is sort of excuse my
 
05:09:11.788 --> 05:09:11.798 align:start position:0%
language but he's sort of fat dumb and
 
05:09:12.990 --> 05:09:13.000 align:start position:0%
happy we don't really have to worry
 
05:09:16.470 --> 05:09:16.480 align:start position:0%
about the patient but if the patient is
 
05:09:19.548 --> 05:09:19.558 align:start position:0%
smart enough to get a lawyer and maybe
 
05:09:21.470 --> 05:09:21.480 align:start position:0%
the law you know there's a concern that
 
05:09:23.070 --> 05:09:23.080 align:start position:0%
somehow there might be a lawsuit then
 
05:09:26.510 --> 05:09:26.520 align:start position:0%
it's okay to discourage that by charging
 
05:09:28.030 --> 05:09:28.040 align:start position:0%
that doesn't make sense to me it just
 
05:09:30.750 --> 05:09:30.760 align:start position:0%
seems to me it's unfair and and the
 
05:09:32.948 --> 05:09:32.958 align:start position:0%
Senate what the Senate has done will
 
05:09:35.350 --> 05:09:35.360 align:start position:0%
amarate that to a great extent so that's
 
05:09:38.070 --> 05:09:38.080 align:start position:0%
why I uh move to Concur and I ask you to
 
05:09:39.990 --> 05:09:40.000 align:start position:0%
support what the Senate has done thank
 
05:09:42.190 --> 05:09:42.200 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr
 
05:11:47.030 --> 05:11:47.040 align:start position:0%
Speaker Mr Speaker if I know that the
 
05:11:49.310 --> 05:11:49.320 align:start position:0%
federal Hippa law guarantees that a
 
05:11:51.390 --> 05:11:51.400 align:start position:0%
patient can get their own medical record
 
05:11:54.708 --> 05:11:54.718 align:start position:0%
for a nominal fee not to exceed
 
05:11:57.070 --> 05:11:57.080 align:start position:0%
$6.50 and if I know that the federal
 
05:11:59.310 --> 05:11:59.320 align:start position:0%
Hippa law leads it up to the
 
05:12:01.670 --> 05:12:01.680 align:start position:0%
states to decide what
 
05:12:04.590 --> 05:12:04.600 align:start position:0%
fees can be charged by Third parties
 
05:12:06.708 --> 05:12:06.718 align:start position:0%
requesting a patient's medical
 
05:12:09.708 --> 05:12:09.718 align:start position:0%
record and if I know the body Health and
 
05:12:11.788 --> 05:12:11.798 align:start position:0%
Human Services and elderly Affairs
 
05:12:13.670 --> 05:12:13.680 align:start position:0%
committee spent a lot of time trying to
 
05:12:16.948 --> 05:12:16.958 align:start position:0%
find a reasonable Fair cap to apply to
 
05:12:18.390 --> 05:12:18.400 align:start position:0%

05:12:20.830 --> 05:12:20.840 align:start position:0%

Voice vote just last week and if I know
 
05:12:35.110 --> 05:12:35.120 align:start position:0%
the Senate added House Bill
 
05:12:37.830 --> 05:12:37.840 align:start position:0%
1265 would simply shift cost to other
 
05:12:39.670 --> 05:12:39.680 align:start position:0%
requesters and medical providers and not
 
05:12:41.670 --> 05:12:41.680 align:start position:0%
come out of settlement fees from the
 
05:12:41.680 --> 05:12:43.110 align:start position:0%
come out of settlement fees from the
plaintiff's

05:12:43.110 --> 05:12:43.120 align:start position:0%

fairness for the very reasons I stated
 
05:13:08.230 --> 05:13:08.240 align:start position:0%
before dealing with the the ability of
 
05:13:10.910 --> 05:13:10.920 align:start position:0%
the patient himself to get the records
 
05:13:12.548 --> 05:13:12.558 align:start position:0%

uh the Senate made very minor changes in
 
05:16:33.788 --> 05:16:33.798 align:start position:0%
in terms of uh uh Chang some language
 
05:16:35.868 --> 05:16:35.878 align:start position:0%
from uh to to make it clear that the
 
05:16:37.868 --> 05:16:37.878 align:start position:0%
chief Jus that duties that were assigned
 
05:16:39.910 --> 05:16:39.920 align:start position:0%

those duties uh the other thing other
 
05:16:46.750 --> 05:16:46.760 align:start position:0%
thing that the Senate did is they

extended the effective date of this bill
 
05:16:53.750 --> 05:16:53.760 align:start position:0%
from January of 2025 to July of 2025 and

$163,000 appropriation in as it came out
 
05:17:05.548 --> 05:17:05.558 align:start position:0%
of the house the Senate took that out by
 
05:17:07.670 --> 05:17:07.680 align:start position:0%
extending it just to the next bium other
 
05:17:09.670 --> 05:17:09.680 align:start position:0%

wholeheartedly and made a couple of
 
05:18:10.470 --> 05:18:10.480 align:start position:0%
minor changes um for the example we
 
05:18:12.910 --> 05:18:12.920 align:start position:0%
suggested at least temporarily narrowing
 
05:18:15.910 --> 05:18:15.920 align:start position:0%
the statutory committees the council
 
05:18:18.708 --> 05:18:18.718 align:start position:0%
would work with the other body preferred
 
05:18:21.830 --> 05:18:21.840 align:start position:0%
to add the phrase primary focus instead
 
05:18:25.110 --> 05:18:25.120 align:start position:0%
of just our word Focus which gives the
 
05:18:26.990 --> 05:18:27.000 align:start position:0%
members more latitude in finding
 
05:18:29.510 --> 05:18:29.520 align:start position:0%

05:19:23.510 --> 05:19:23.520 align:start position:0%
H thank you Mr
 
05:19:26.470 --> 05:19:26.480 align:start position:0%
Speaker the bill before you has been
 
05:19:28.190 --> 05:19:28.200 align:start position:0%
attempted in this house multiple times
 
05:19:30.270 --> 05:19:30.280 align:start position:0%
over the past couple of years this is
 
05:19:32.948 --> 05:19:32.958 align:start position:0%
relative to when a legislator should
 
05:19:35.590 --> 05:19:35.600 align:start position:0%
recuse themselves on
 
05:19:38.470 --> 05:19:38.480 align:start position:0%
legislation now I I there are people in
 
05:19:40.830 --> 05:19:40.840 align:start position:0%
this chamber potentially and I know
 
05:19:42.868 --> 05:19:42.878 align:start position:0%
there were former members of the House
 
05:19:45.948 --> 05:19:45.958 align:start position:0%
and Senate who may have violated our
 
05:19:49.510 --> 05:19:49.520 align:start position:0%
current ethics rules and while I
 
05:19:51.430 --> 05:19:51.440 align:start position:0%
potentially disagree with those members
 
05:19:53.708 --> 05:19:53.718 align:start position:0%
on the subject matter I do believe they
 
05:19:57.990 --> 05:19:58.000 align:start position:0%
have a right to talk to to discuss to
 
05:19:59.708 --> 05:19:59.718 align:start position:0%
participate in the
 
05:20:02.150 --> 05:20:02.160 align:start position:0%
legislation our ethics guidelines today
 
05:20:05.030 --> 05:20:05.040 align:start position:0%
are very clear and I want to read a a
 
05:20:07.430 --> 05:20:07.440 align:start position:0%
couple of sections of this it defines
 
05:20:09.270 --> 05:20:09.280 align:start position:0%
conflict of interest is the condition in
 
05:20:10.788 --> 05:20:10.798 align:start position:0%
which a legislator has a special
 
05:20:13.470 --> 05:20:13.480 align:start position:0%
interest in any matter and could
 
05:20:15.030 --> 05:20:15.040 align:start position:0%
directly or indirectly affect the
 
05:20:16.510 --> 05:20:16.520 align:start position:0%
influence and performance of that
 
05:20:16.520 --> 05:20:19.190 align:start position:0%
influence and performance of that
legislator's

05:20:19.190 --> 05:20:19.200 align:start position:0%
legislator's
 
05:20:22.310 --> 05:20:22.320 align:start position:0%
activities it also defines the purpose
 
05:20:24.750 --> 05:20:24.760 align:start position:0%
of this this ethics guidelines
 
05:20:26.788 --> 05:20:26.798 align:start position:0%
legislators shall treat their office as
 
05:20:29.350 --> 05:20:29.360 align:start position:0%
a public trust using only powers and
 
05:20:31.030 --> 05:20:31.040 align:start position:0%
resources of the public office to
 
05:20:33.190 --> 05:20:33.200 align:start position:0%
advance public interest and not to
 
05:20:35.310 --> 05:20:35.320 align:start position:0%
attain personal benefits or to pursue
 
05:20:37.670 --> 05:20:37.680 align:start position:0%
any other private interest incompatible
 
05:20:40.910 --> 05:20:40.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:43.390 --> 05:20:43.400 align:start position:0%
the bill before you doesn't prohibit
 
05:20:46.868 --> 05:20:46.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:49.788 --> 05:20:49.798 align:start position:0%
participation it doesn't it doesn't stop
 
05:20:52.470 --> 05:20:52.480 align:start position:0%
at the mere thing of preventing filing
 
05:20:53.590 --> 05:20:53.600 align:start position:0%
of a
 
05:20:57.110 --> 05:20:57.120 align:start position:0%
bill preventing voting on a bill this
 
05:20:59.548 --> 05:20:59.558 align:start position:0%
goes much further and the issue with
 
05:21:01.548 --> 05:21:01.558 align:start position:0%
this is it's going to handcuff our
 
05:21:03.868 --> 05:21:03.878 align:start position:0%
legislators in their ability to
 
05:21:05.270 --> 05:21:05.280 align:start position:0%
represent their
 
05:21:07.548 --> 05:21:07.558 align:start position:0%
constituents let me give you a couple of
 
05:21:10.390 --> 05:21:10.400 align:start position:0%
examples there's some doctors in here
 
05:21:12.708 --> 05:21:12.718 align:start position:0%
they may have small medical
 
05:21:15.070 --> 05:21:15.080 align:start position:0%
practices they meet the
 
05:21:18.150 --> 05:21:18.160 align:start position:0%
exclusionary section of this proposed
 
05:21:21.750 --> 05:21:21.760 align:start position:0%
bill they are in fact renumerated
 
05:21:23.110 --> 05:21:23.120 align:start position:0%
presumably if they're a small business
 
05:21:25.830 --> 05:21:25.840 align:start position:0%
owner they want to actually get a
 
05:21:28.350 --> 05:21:28.360 align:start position:0%
paycheck they hold the position to
 
05:21:32.510 --> 05:21:32.520 align:start position:0%
exercise substantial influence over the
 
05:21:34.990 --> 05:21:35.000 align:start position:0%
organization and if that organization or
 
05:21:36.948 --> 05:21:36.958 align:start position:0%
that office has ever lobbied testified
 
05:21:38.910 --> 05:21:38.920 align:start position:0%
or otherwise attempted to influence the
 
05:21:41.548 --> 05:21:41.558 align:start position:0%
outcome of official legislative activity
 
05:21:44.670 --> 05:21:44.680 align:start position:0%
they now are triggered from Full
 
05:21:48.310 --> 05:21:48.320 align:start position:0%
recusal in partic in in participation
 
05:21:51.990 --> 05:21:52.000 align:start position:0%
not just voting on drafting a bunch of
 
05:21:54.230 --> 05:21:54.240 align:start position:0%
other things this means they can't even
 
05:21:55.910 --> 05:21:55.920 align:start position:0%
be part of the discussion about whether
 
05:21:58.430 --> 05:21:58.440 align:start position:0%
the bill is a good idea or not even
 
05:22:00.310 --> 05:22:00.320 align:start position:0%
though they have the technical expertise
 
05:22:02.430 --> 05:22:02.440 align:start position:0%
to weigh in on the subject matter now
 
05:22:03.670 --> 05:22:03.680 align:start position:0%
this applies to people who have
 
05:22:05.150 --> 05:22:05.160 align:start position:0%
insurance companies this applies to
 
05:22:07.030 --> 05:22:07.040 align:start position:0%
doctors this applies to Engineers this
 
05:22:08.510 --> 05:22:08.520 align:start position:0%
applies to everybody who is a tech
 
05:22:12.190 --> 05:22:12.200 align:start position:0%
technical expert who owns a small
 
05:22:14.708 --> 05:22:14.718 align:start position:0%
company there is an issue I agree we
 
05:22:17.830 --> 05:22:17.840 align:start position:0%
need to fix our ethics guidelines this
 
05:22:19.390 --> 05:22:19.400 align:start position:0%
goes a step too
 
05:22:22.430 --> 05:22:22.440 align:start position:0%
far what the Senate did when they or the
 
05:22:24.110 --> 05:22:24.120 align:start position:0%
me the body behind us did when they
 
05:22:26.948 --> 05:22:26.958 align:start position:0%

inquiry thank you Mr Speaker if I know

that legislators are already prohibited

from our guidelines in introducing
 
05:25:30.270 --> 05:25:30.280 align:start position:0%
legislation testifying before a
 
05:25:32.310 --> 05:25:32.320 align:start position:0%
legislative committee voting in a

when they have a defined conflict of
 
05:25:39.470 --> 05:25:39.480 align:start position:0%
interest if I know that they have to

announce that conflict of interest if it
 
05:25:43.708 --> 05:25:43.718 align:start position:0%
meets the ethics
 
05:25:46.030 --> 05:25:46.040 align:start position:0%
guidelines if I further know that this
 
05:25:48.390 --> 05:25:48.400 align:start position:0%
bill will handcuff future legislators
 
05:25:51.510 --> 05:25:51.520 align:start position:0%

Mr Speaker if I know our citizen
 
05:26:28.590 --> 05:26:28.600 align:start position:0%
legislators need to be continually
 
05:26:30.788 --> 05:26:30.798 align:start position:0%
concerned with the topic of conflicts of

05:48:24.708 --> 05:48:24.718 align:start position:0%
other body completely changed the bill
 
05:48:27.110 --> 05:48:27.120 align:start position:0%
the bill was requested by the community
 
05:48:29.830 --> 05:48:29.840 align:start position:0%
power Coalition of New Hampshire just to
 
05:48:31.910 --> 05:48:31.920 align:start position:0%
remind everybody the community power
 
05:48:34.190 --> 05:48:34.200 align:start position:0%
Coalition provides a market-based
 
05:48:37.230 --> 05:48:37.240 align:start position:0%
approach to our electric supply and it
 
05:48:40.670 --> 05:48:40.680 align:start position:0%
reduces costs for Granite State
 
05:48:44.750 --> 05:48:44.760 align:start position:0%
customers the bill that we sent allows
 
05:48:47.030 --> 05:48:47.040 align:start position:0%
Community power to use en the member
 
05:48:47.040 --> 05:48:48.990 align:start position:0%
Community power to use en the member
will

05:48:48.990 --> 05:48:49.000 align:start position:0%
will
 
05:48:51.390 --> 05:48:51.400 align:start position:0%
suspend the noise in the chamber is
 
05:48:52.628 --> 05:48:52.638 align:start position:0%
getting to be
 
05:48:55.070 --> 05:48:55.080 align:start position:0%
deafening a member has a right to be
 
05:48:56.868 --> 05:48:56.878 align:start position:0%
heard if you need to take have a
 
05:48:59.390 --> 05:48:59.400 align:start position:0%
conversation take it out in the back
 
05:49:02.190 --> 05:49:02.200 align:start position:0%
room remember may continue thank you
 
05:49:05.030 --> 05:49:05.040 align:start position:0%
very much Mr Speaker I appreciate that
 
05:49:07.390 --> 05:49:07.400 align:start position:0%
the bill that we sent excuse me the bill
 
05:49:10.230 --> 05:49:10.240 align:start position:0%
that we sent allows Community power to
 
05:49:13.390 --> 05:49:13.400 align:start position:0%
use energy that's created locally to
 
05:49:16.030 --> 05:49:16.040 align:start position:0%
lower prices for Community power
 
05:49:18.510 --> 05:49:18.520 align:start position:0%
customers they can already do this for
 
05:49:21.628 --> 05:49:21.638 align:start position:0%
power that is at most one megawatt and
 
05:49:24.110 --> 05:49:24.120 align:start position:0%
all this bill does is increases the
 
05:49:28.750 --> 05:49:28.760 align:start position:0%
range to up to 5 megawatts there is no
 
05:49:32.868 --> 05:49:32.878 align:start position:0%
cost shift to utility rate payers again
 
05:49:36.830 --> 05:49:36.840 align:start position:0%
no cost shift to utility rate payers it
 
05:49:39.190 --> 05:49:39.200 align:start position:0%
helps Community power we want to help
 
05:49:41.030 --> 05:49:41.040 align:start position:0%
Community power we want to remove
 
05:49:42.990 --> 05:49:43.000 align:start position:0%
roadblocks and there are several
 
05:49:46.628 --> 05:49:46.638 align:start position:0%
projects ready to go right now and just
 
05:49:48.948 --> 05:49:48.958 align:start position:0%
also to remind you community power is
 
05:49:52.830 --> 05:49:52.840 align:start position:0%
already serving towns representing about
 
05:49:56.270 --> 05:49:56.280 align:start position:0%
35% of the state's population uh
 
05:49:58.270 --> 05:49:58.280 align:start position:0%
including the town of eping from which
 
05:50:01.628 --> 05:50:01.638 align:start position:0%
my good friend uh uh is the
 
05:50:03.510 --> 05:50:03.520 align:start position:0%
representative now what did the other
 
05:50:06.190 --> 05:50:06.200 align:start position:0%
body do they turned this bill into a
 
05:50:06.200 --> 05:50:07.190 align:start position:0%
body do they turned this bill into a
committee

05:50:07.190 --> 05:50:07.200 align:start position:0%
committee
 
05:50:10.548 --> 05:50:10.558 align:start position:0%
to study Community power so I believe we
 
05:50:13.150 --> 05:50:13.160 align:start position:0%
should non-c Concur and request a
 
05:50:15.628 --> 05:50:15.638 align:start position:0%
committee of conference and actually the
 
05:50:19.270 --> 05:50:19.280 align:start position:0%
other body actually wants us to do this
 
05:50:20.430 --> 05:50:20.440 align:start position:0%
let me
 
05:50:23.910 --> 05:50:23.920 align:start position:0%
explain during the hearing in the house
 
05:50:26.948 --> 05:50:26.958 align:start position:0%
science technology and energy committee
 
05:50:29.230 --> 05:50:29.240 align:start position:0%
the department of energy testified that
 
05:50:31.350 --> 05:50:31.360 align:start position:0%
they were neutral on this
 
05:50:34.708 --> 05:50:34.718 align:start position:0%
bill and it passed our committee
 
05:50:38.230 --> 05:50:38.240 align:start position:0%
unanimously and passed this body on
 
05:50:40.750 --> 05:50:40.760 align:start position:0%
consent then it went over to the other
 
05:50:43.230 --> 05:50:43.240 align:start position:0%
body where the energy and natural
 
05:50:45.708 --> 05:50:45.718 align:start position:0%
resources committee heard it and the
 
05:50:49.030 --> 05:50:49.040 align:start position:0%
department of energy again testified
 
05:50:51.910 --> 05:50:51.920 align:start position:0%
that they were neutral on the
 
05:50:55.350 --> 05:50:55.360 align:start position:0%
bill weeks later just before the energy
 
05:50:57.190 --> 05:50:57.200 align:start position:0%
and natural resources Committee of the
 
05:51:00.430 --> 05:51:00.440 align:start position:0%
other body was about to exec the bill
 
05:51:02.830 --> 05:51:02.840 align:start position:0%
the department of energy sent a letter
 
05:51:04.430 --> 05:51:04.440 align:start position:0%
to the committee
 
05:51:07.070 --> 05:51:07.080 align:start position:0%
chair changing its position
 
05:51:09.590 --> 05:51:09.600 align:start position:0%
opposing the
 
05:51:13.150 --> 05:51:13.160 align:start position:0%
bill the letter listed some concerns and
 
05:51:16.030 --> 05:51:16.040 align:start position:0%
the community power Coalition responded
 
05:51:19.948 --> 05:51:19.958 align:start position:0%
in detail to every one of those concerns
 
05:51:19.958 --> 05:51:20.990 align:start position:0%
in detail to every one of those concerns
in

05:51:20.990 --> 05:51:21.000 align:start position:0%
in
 
05:51:26.788 --> 05:51:26.798 align:start position:0%
detail the letter also raised unintended
 
05:51:28.910 --> 05:51:28.920 align:start position:0%
consequences Mr
 
05:51:32.628 --> 05:51:32.638 align:start position:0%
Speaker any bill could have unintended
 
05:51:34.868 --> 05:51:34.878 align:start position:0%
consequences but you got to say what
 
05:51:37.070 --> 05:51:37.080 align:start position:0%
they are otherwise
 
05:51:39.708 --> 05:51:39.718 align:start position:0%
frankly you're just blowing
 
05:51:42.310 --> 05:51:42.320 align:start position:0%
smoke so what happened was that the
 
05:51:44.628 --> 05:51:44.638 align:start position:0%
president of the other body who is a
 
05:51:46.510 --> 05:51:46.520 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor of this bill and would like
 
05:51:49.430 --> 05:51:49.440 align:start position:0%
to see it get through offered an
 
05:51:52.310 --> 05:51:52.320 align:start position:0%
amendment to create the study commission
 
05:51:55.628 --> 05:51:55.638 align:start position:0%
why would he do that was to buy time for
 
05:51:57.750 --> 05:51:57.760 align:start position:0%
further negotiation with the Department
 
05:52:00.868 --> 05:52:00.878 align:start position:0%
of energy which so far has really been
 
05:52:03.468 --> 05:52:03.478 align:start position:0%
unwilling to engage with the community
 
05:52:07.590 --> 05:52:07.600 align:start position:0%
power Coalition so this amendment that
 
05:52:10.468 --> 05:52:10.478 align:start position:0%
we are being asked to concur with is
 
05:52:14.468 --> 05:52:14.478 align:start position:0%
merely a placeholder it is there just to
 
05:52:18.510 --> 05:52:18.520 align:start position:0%
resolve differences in the committee of
 
05:52:20.708 --> 05:52:20.718 align:start position:0%
conference the president of the other
 
05:52:22.750 --> 05:52:22.760 align:start position:0%
body wants this bill he wants a
 
05:52:25.150 --> 05:52:25.160 align:start position:0%
committee of conference to get us there
 
05:52:28.868 --> 05:52:28.878 align:start position:0%
I would like the same we do not need a
 
05:52:32.468 --> 05:52:32.478 align:start position:0%
study committee to study Community power
 
05:52:34.390 --> 05:52:34.400 align:start position:0%
it's already happening we don't need to
 
05:52:37.750 --> 05:52:37.760 align:start position:0%
study it so I ask you to please vote
 
05:52:40.990 --> 05:52:41.000 align:start position:0%
against the concur motion with this
 
05:52:43.910 --> 05:52:43.920 align:start position:0%
placeholder Amendment so that we can
 
05:52:46.548 --> 05:52:46.558 align:start position:0%
have a motion to non-c Concur and
 
05:52:49.868 --> 05:52:49.878 align:start position:0%
request a committee of conference and Mr
 
05:52:52.708 --> 05:52:52.718 align:start position:0%
Speaker I request a division vote do a
 
05:52:54.948 --> 05:52:54.958 align:start position:0%
member yield the questions I do not
 
05:52:57.190 --> 05:52:57.200 align:start position:0%
member does not yield chair recognize
 
05:52:57.200 --> 05:52:58.990 align:start position:0%
member does not yield chair recognize
representative

05:52:58.990 --> 05:52:59.000 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:53:02.788 --> 05:53:02.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:05.190 --> 05:53:05.200 align:start position:0%
Speaker as my esteemed colleague from
 
05:53:07.230 --> 05:53:07.240 align:start position:0%
Lebanon just pointed out
 
05:53:10.070 --> 05:53:10.080 align:start position:0%
out during the Committee hearing on this
 
05:53:12.628 --> 05:53:12.638 align:start position:0%
bill the department of energy said that
 
05:53:15.468 --> 05:53:15.478 align:start position:0%
they were neutral on the policy aspect
 
05:53:16.350 --> 05:53:16.360 align:start position:0%
of the
 
05:53:18.628 --> 05:53:18.638 align:start position:0%
bill but they did point out that they
 
05:53:21.110 --> 05:53:21.120 align:start position:0%
had some concerns about
 
05:53:25.070 --> 05:53:25.080 align:start position:0%
it they were unable to articulate those
 
05:53:28.350 --> 05:53:28.360 align:start position:0%
concerns before the committee so we
 
05:53:31.590 --> 05:53:31.600 align:start position:0%
passed the bill thinking that they were
 
05:53:34.788 --> 05:53:34.798 align:start position:0%
okay with it when the bill got to the
 
05:53:37.030 --> 05:53:37.040 align:start position:0%
Senate they
 
05:53:39.230 --> 05:53:39.240 align:start position:0%
once again testified that they were
 
05:53:40.670 --> 05:53:40.680 align:start position:0%
neutral on the
 
05:53:43.230 --> 05:53:43.240 align:start position:0%
policy but that they had some concerns
 
05:53:45.390 --> 05:53:45.400 align:start position:0%
with it when they were pressed to
 
05:53:47.310 --> 05:53:47.320 align:start position:0%
express those concerns they eventually
 
05:53:50.910 --> 05:53:50.920 align:start position:0%
sent a letter to Senate
 
05:53:54.270 --> 05:53:54.280 align:start position:0%
enr and they asked some serious
 
05:53:57.868 --> 05:53:57.878 align:start position:0%
questions questions like who will ensure
 
05:53:59.990 --> 05:54:00.000 align:start position:0%
and how will it be determined that the
 
05:54:01.830 --> 05:54:01.840 align:start position:0%
group load will be greater than the
 
05:54:04.990 --> 05:54:05.000 align:start position:0%
community supplier what happens if it
 
05:54:07.628 --> 05:54:07.638 align:start position:0%
isn't what will the registration process
 
05:54:09.708 --> 05:54:09.718 align:start position:0%
and requirements look like for Community
 
05:54:12.390 --> 05:54:12.400 align:start position:0%
suppliers and how will these entities be
 
05:54:14.670 --> 05:54:14.680 align:start position:0%
monitored to ensure requirements are
 
05:54:14.680 --> 05:54:16.030 align:start position:0%
monitored to ensure requirements are
being

05:54:16.030 --> 05:54:16.040 align:start position:0%
being
 
05:54:18.910 --> 05:54:18.920 align:start position:0%
met what will be the oversight mechanism
 
05:54:21.430 --> 05:54:21.440 align:start position:0%
to ensure Community suppliers are in
 
05:54:24.548 --> 05:54:24.558 align:start position:0%
ongoing compliance with applicable
 
05:54:27.510 --> 05:54:27.520 align:start position:0%
statutes and pu rules will this
 
05:54:29.708 --> 05:54:29.718 align:start position:0%
oversight require involvement from the
 
05:54:32.708 --> 05:54:32.718 align:start position:0%
community aggregator the department and
 
05:54:34.708 --> 05:54:34.718 align:start position:0%
the distribution
 
05:54:37.230 --> 05:54:37.240 align:start position:0%
utility will community the aggregators
 
05:54:39.310 --> 05:54:39.320 align:start position:0%
in towns served by more than one
 
05:54:42.868 --> 05:54:42.878 align:start position:0%
distribution utility complicate
 
05:54:45.430 --> 05:54:45.440 align:start position:0%
oversight who will provide oversight to
 
05:54:48.110 --> 05:54:48.120 align:start position:0%
ensure the statute is being applied
 
05:54:52.468 --> 05:54:52.478 align:start position:0%
consistently across Community
 
05:54:54.350 --> 05:54:54.360 align:start position:0%
aggregations the department also
 
05:54:56.070 --> 05:54:56.080 align:start position:0%
indicated that time is needed to Think
 
05:54:59.430 --> 05:54:59.440 align:start position:0%
Through the unintended consequence
 
05:55:01.670 --> 05:55:01.680 align:start position:0%
scenarios to ensure that there are guard
 
05:55:04.788 --> 05:55:04.798 align:start position:0%
rails in place these consequences may
 
05:55:06.990 --> 05:55:07.000 align:start position:0%
leave the department and the legislature
 
05:55:11.270 --> 05:55:11.280 align:start position:0%
to deal to deal with some unresolved
 
05:55:13.708 --> 05:55:13.718 align:start position:0%
issues and finally they pointed out that
 
05:55:13.718 --> 05:55:15.390 align:start position:0%
issues and finally they pointed out that
issues

05:55:15.390 --> 05:55:15.400 align:start position:0%
issues
 
05:55:17.670 --> 05:55:17.680 align:start position:0%
concerning net metering are under
 
05:55:20.070 --> 05:55:20.080 align:start position:0%
consideration in a department of energy
 
05:55:20.080 --> 05:55:22.110 align:start position:0%
consideration in a department of energy
docket

05:55:22.110 --> 05:55:22.120 align:start position:0%
docket
 
05:55:24.590 --> 05:55:24.600 align:start position:0%
23063 and the question of the reduction
 
05:55:26.110 --> 05:55:26.120 align:start position:0%
of wholesale load
 
05:55:28.670 --> 05:55:28.680 align:start position:0%
obligations both still need to be
 
05:55:34.670 --> 05:55:34.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:37.070 --> 05:55:37.080 align:start position:0%
practice now these
 
05:55:40.670 --> 05:55:40.680 align:start position:0%
concerns that the department has
 
05:55:43.350 --> 05:55:43.360 align:start position:0%
certainly are sufficient to Warrant a
 
05:55:43.360 --> 05:55:44.350 align:start position:0%
certainly are sufficient to Warrant a
study

05:55:44.350 --> 05:55:44.360 align:start position:0%
study
 
05:55:47.190 --> 05:55:47.200 align:start position:0%
committee so the Senate decided that
 
05:55:50.350 --> 05:55:50.360 align:start position:0%
that was an effective way to deal with
 
05:55:53.628 --> 05:55:53.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:56.110 --> 05:55:56.120 align:start position:0%
uncertainties none of us is real happy
 
05:55:58.150 --> 05:55:58.160 align:start position:0%
with creating a study committee in the

tkart thank you Mr Speaker good
 
06:07:46.430 --> 06:07:46.440 align:start position:0%
afternoon again I want to make it clear
 
06:07:48.310 --> 06:07:48.320 align:start position:0%
that there are two parts to this bill
 
06:07:50.788 --> 06:07:50.798 align:start position:0%
the original language and an amendment
 
06:07:53.350 --> 06:07:53.360 align:start position:0%
that was added by the Senate which has
 
06:07:56.510 --> 06:07:56.520 align:start position:0%
uh been known as now the uh Hampton
 
06:08:00.548 --> 06:08:00.558 align:start position:0%
discontinua Road Amendment I'm speaking
 
06:08:04.548 --> 06:08:04.558 align:start position:0%
only to the second part and that is the
 
06:08:06.628 --> 06:08:06.638 align:start position:0%
new Amendment
 
06:08:09.468 --> 06:08:09.478 align:start position:0%
the amendment to this uh hb1 1215 would
 
06:08:12.390 --> 06:08:12.400 align:start position:0%
allow the board of Selectmen in Hampton
 
06:08:15.070 --> 06:08:15.080 align:start position:0%
to discontinue a road a Town Road in the
 
06:08:18.070 --> 06:08:18.080 align:start position:0%
beach area bypassing our ex our existing
 
06:08:20.910 --> 06:08:20.920 align:start position:0%
laws then rent out that road for up to
 
06:08:24.230 --> 06:08:24.240 align:start position:0%
99 years to some unknown private
 
06:08:26.868 --> 06:08:26.878 align:start position:0%
business this is not a class six Road
 
06:08:28.548 --> 06:08:28.558 align:start position:0%
like you'd find out in the woods that
 
06:08:31.350 --> 06:08:31.360 align:start position:0%
they're discontinuing this is a uh a
 
06:08:34.190 --> 06:08:34.200 align:start position:0%
road in the middle of the downtown
 
06:08:36.030 --> 06:08:36.040 align:start position:0%
business and residential District of
 
06:08:39.070 --> 06:08:39.080 align:start position:0%
Hampton Beach known as Avenue D any of
 
06:08:40.430 --> 06:08:40.440 align:start position:0%
you who've been down in Hampton Beach
 
06:08:42.190 --> 06:08:42.200 align:start position:0%
you know how the Avenues work they go
 
06:08:46.150 --> 06:08:46.160 align:start position:0%
from Ash Ashworth AB all the way down to
 
06:08:46.160 --> 06:08:48.708 align:start position:0%
from Ash Ashworth AB all the way down to
Route

06:08:48.708 --> 06:08:48.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:51.590 --> 06:08:51.600 align:start position:0%
1A so this would bypass the normal
 
06:08:53.390 --> 06:08:53.400 align:start position:0%
process where the town votes on whether
 
06:08:55.548 --> 06:08:55.558 align:start position:0%
to allow such an action at either a
 
06:08:58.548 --> 06:08:58.558 align:start position:0%
regular or special town meeting special
 
06:09:00.548 --> 06:09:00.558 align:start position:0%
Town meetings can be called by either
 
06:09:03.310 --> 06:09:03.320 align:start position:0%
the Selectmen or the town citizens and a
 
06:09:06.590 --> 06:09:06.600 align:start position:0%
Butters only require 14 days notice this
 
06:09:08.868 --> 06:09:08.878 align:start position:0%
is less than a couple of months it would
 
06:09:12.788 --> 06:09:12.798 align:start position:0%
take to uh go through the normal process
 
06:09:15.548 --> 06:09:15.558 align:start position:0%
so one has to ask why why the rush and
 
06:09:17.548 --> 06:09:17.558 align:start position:0%
why a special carve out that ends up in
 
06:09:18.990 --> 06:09:19.000 align:start position:0%
our rsas
 
06:09:21.190 --> 06:09:21.200 align:start position:0%
permanently New Hampshire law is very
 
06:09:23.110 --> 06:09:23.120 align:start position:0%
specific that town residents are the
 
06:09:25.390 --> 06:09:25.400 align:start position:0%
local legislative body empowered to
 
06:09:28.468 --> 06:09:28.478 align:start position:0%
discontinue roads not the Selectmen this
 
06:09:30.270 --> 06:09:30.280 align:start position:0%
takes away the H the residents of
 
06:09:35.070 --> 06:09:35.080 align:start position:0%
Hampton's right to vote on this issue I
 
06:09:37.070 --> 06:09:37.080 align:start position:0%
want enough bill for a special project
 
06:09:39.830 --> 06:09:39.840 align:start position:0%
sets a terrible precedent if this passes
 
06:09:42.190 --> 06:09:42.200 align:start position:0%
we we will then see repeated and
 
06:09:44.750 --> 06:09:44.760 align:start position:0%
frequent attempts to use this precedent
 
06:09:46.670 --> 06:09:46.680 align:start position:0%
if you think about it this would be very
 
06:09:48.910 --> 06:09:48.920 align:start position:0%
similar to or actually worse in a lot
 
06:09:52.310 --> 06:09:52.320 align:start position:0%
worse than taking Land by eminent Don uh
 
06:09:55.070 --> 06:09:55.080 align:start position:0%
eminent domain what about the abutters
 
06:09:56.990 --> 06:09:57.000 align:start position:0%
property rights here could this be
 
06:09:59.350 --> 06:09:59.360 align:start position:0%
construed as the use of eminent uh
 
06:10:01.990 --> 06:10:02.000 align:start position:0%
domain by a town to benefit a private
 
06:10:04.830 --> 06:10:04.840 align:start position:0%
entity or whoever that may be I want to
 
06:10:07.548 --> 06:10:07.558 align:start position:0%
read you something something in 2006 New
 
06:10:09.750 --> 06:10:09.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Senate Bill 287 was signed
 
06:10:12.830 --> 06:10:12.840 align:start position:0%
into law after a US US Supreme Court
 
06:10:15.270 --> 06:10:15.280 align:start position:0%
decision case that allowed a Connecticut
 
06:10:17.310 --> 06:10:17.320 align:start position:0%
town to take private property for
 
06:10:17.320 --> 06:10:18.990 align:start position:0%
town to take private property for
commercial

06:10:18.990 --> 06:10:19.000 align:start position:0%
commercial
 
06:10:21.270 --> 06:10:21.280 align:start position:0%
development it was signed into law by
 
06:10:22.750 --> 06:10:22.760 align:start position:0%
the governor at the time and that law
 
06:10:25.670 --> 06:10:25.680 align:start position:0%
stated public use shall not include the
 
06:10:27.910 --> 06:10:27.920 align:start position:0%
public benefits resulting from private
 
06:10:30.230 --> 06:10:30.240 align:start position:0%
Economic Development and private
 
06:10:32.468 --> 06:10:32.478 align:start position:0%
commercial Enterprise including
 
06:10:34.868 --> 06:10:34.878 align:start position:0%
increased tax revenues and increased
 
06:10:37.350 --> 06:10:37.360 align:start position:0%
employment and opportunities If This
 
06:10:40.070 --> 06:10:40.080 align:start position:0%
Were to go through you're going to see a
 
06:10:40.080 --> 06:10:41.548 align:start position:0%
Were to go through you're going to see a
large

06:10:41.548 --> 06:10:41.558 align:start position:0%
large
 
06:10:44.670 --> 06:10:44.680 align:start position:0%
amount several law suits that going to
 
06:10:46.430 --> 06:10:46.440 align:start position:0%
be filed and it's actually going to take
 
06:10:48.150 --> 06:10:48.160 align:start position:0%
longer to get through the lawsuit
 
06:10:50.670 --> 06:10:50.680 align:start position:0%
process than you are to go ahead and
 
06:10:54.430 --> 06:10:54.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:56.868 --> 06:10:56.878 align:start position:0%
meeting this is about property rights of
 
06:11:00.230 --> 06:11:00.240 align:start position:0%
the abuts and the town citizens this is
 
06:11:03.270 --> 06:11:03.280 align:start position:0%
about this body not setting a bad
 
06:11:04.708 --> 06:11:04.718 align:start position:0%
precedent that could affect many
 
06:11:06.590 --> 06:11:06.600 align:start position:0%
property Property Owners throughout our
 
06:11:08.990 --> 06:11:09.000 align:start position:0%
state in the future by allowing The
 
06:11:11.670 --> 06:11:11.680 align:start position:0%
Taking of property by adverse
 
06:11:14.190 --> 06:11:14.200 align:start position:0%
possession above all this is about
 
06:11:17.310 --> 06:11:17.320 align:start position:0%
consistency versus arbitrariness I know
 
06:11:19.230 --> 06:11:19.240 align:start position:0%
in our committee we try to remain
 
06:11:22.590 --> 06:11:22.600 align:start position:0%
consistent no one-offs no special
 
06:11:25.548 --> 06:11:25.558 align:start position:0%
dispensations placed into the
 
06:11:28.830 --> 06:11:28.840 align:start position:0%
rsas I've been authorized by the uh HRA
 
06:11:30.628 --> 06:11:30.638 align:start position:0%
to repeat what I said in caucus this
 
06:11:32.390 --> 06:11:32.400 align:start position:0%
morning and that is the pink sheet is
 
06:11:34.830 --> 06:11:34.840 align:start position:0%
incorrect it was supposed to agree with
 
06:11:36.910 --> 06:11:36.920 align:start position:0%
what I'm trying to get you here and that
 
06:11:40.948 --> 06:11:40.958 align:start position:0%
is vote against the motion to concur so
 
06:11:44.750 --> 06:11:44.760 align:start position:0%
we can send this over to a committee
 
06:11:47.948 --> 06:11:47.958 align:start position:0%
conference and remove this
 
06:11:51.468 --> 06:11:51.478 align:start position:0%
added um the added Amendment from the
 
06:11:53.990 --> 06:11:54.000 align:start position:0%
Senate again I'm only speaking to that
 
06:11:56.310 --> 06:11:56.320 align:start position:0%
Amendment I'm not speaking to the
 
06:11:58.468 --> 06:11:58.478 align:start position:0%
original language even though some
 
06:12:01.190 --> 06:12:01.200 align:start position:0%
people may have something to say about
 
06:12:03.948 --> 06:12:03.958 align:start position:0%
that so I'll ask you to vote red on the
 
06:12:06.230 --> 06:12:06.240 align:start position:0%

can be made thank you Mr Speaker J

06:12:53.830 --> 06:12:53.840 align:start position:0%
a um rule suspension for that particular
 
06:12:56.150 --> 06:12:56.160 align:start position:0%
purpose of allowing the town of Hampton
 
06:12:58.708 --> 06:12:58.718 align:start position:0%
to enter into a lease agreement of one
 
06:13:01.468 --> 06:13:01.478 align:start position:0%
and only one clearly identified Road
 
06:13:04.270 --> 06:13:04.280 align:start position:0%
only after two public hearings are held
 
06:13:06.150 --> 06:13:06.160 align:start position:0%
for the purposes of of redeveloping the
 
06:13:08.270 --> 06:13:08.280 align:start position:0%
casino ballroom I don't know if you've
 
06:13:09.628 --> 06:13:09.638 align:start position:0%
been there recently I think it's a great
 
06:13:11.270 --> 06:13:11.280 align:start position:0%
area but I think we could use some a
 
06:13:13.190 --> 06:13:13.200 align:start position:0%
little bit of economic revitalization
 
06:13:15.548 --> 06:13:15.558 align:start position:0%
there um with significant fire and
 
06:13:17.948 --> 06:13:17.958 align:start position:0%
safety issues into a vibrant multi-use
 
06:13:19.990 --> 06:13:20.000 align:start position:0%
facility that will bring in much tax
 
06:13:22.708 --> 06:13:22.718 align:start position:0%
revenue for the state and um tourism and
 
06:13:26.150 --> 06:13:26.160 align:start position:0%
hopefully a lot more money and many jobs
 
06:13:27.868 --> 06:13:27.878 align:start position:0%
the silver lining of this renovation
 
06:13:29.468 --> 06:13:29.478 align:start position:0%
project is that the decline of Hampton
 
06:13:30.948 --> 06:13:30.958 align:start position:0%
Beach has been experiencing over the
 
06:13:33.708 --> 06:13:33.718 align:start position:0%
last decade will reverse and the entire
 
06:13:35.830 --> 06:13:35.840 align:start position:0%
Beach area will improve in safety and
 
06:13:38.190 --> 06:13:38.200 align:start position:0%
prosperity um so very important that
 
06:13:41.190 --> 06:13:41.200 align:start position:0%
section 8 repeals section 6 and 7 so
 
06:13:42.628 --> 06:13:42.638 align:start position:0%
it's closing the door on this rule
 
06:13:45.510 --> 06:13:45.520 align:start position:0%
suspension this is a one-time suspension
 
06:13:47.468 --> 06:13:47.478 align:start position:0%
of this to allow Hampton to do this
 
06:13:49.468 --> 06:13:49.478 align:start position:0%
project um the people of Hampton are
 
06:13:50.830 --> 06:13:50.840 align:start position:0%
asking for it and they also have
 
06:13:52.708 --> 06:13:52.718 align:start position:0%
opportunity for public hearing so this
 
06:13:54.708 --> 06:13:54.718 align:start position:0%
is still a local control issue thank you
 
06:13:54.718 --> 06:13:56.468 align:start position:0%
is still a local control issue thank you
please

06:13:56.468 --> 06:13:56.478 align:start position:0%

06:15:51.110 --> 06:15:51.120 align:start position:0%
inquiry thank you Mr
 
06:15:54.430 --> 06:15:54.440 align:start position:0%
Speaker Mr Speaker if I know that hb1
 
06:15:56.990 --> 06:15:57.000 align:start position:0%
1215 now includes this puzzling
 
06:15:59.628 --> 06:15:59.638 align:start position:0%
amendment that restates what the town of
 
06:16:01.788 --> 06:16:01.798 align:start position:0%
Hampton's governing body and planning
 
06:16:05.270 --> 06:16:05.280 align:start position:0%
board can already do and if I know that
 
06:16:07.990 --> 06:16:08.000 align:start position:0%
the underlying Bill meant to alleviate
 
06:16:10.708 --> 06:16:10.718 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's acute housing shortage
 
06:16:13.708 --> 06:16:13.718 align:start position:0%
will only perpetuate that shortage by
 
06:16:17.150 --> 06:16:17.160 align:start position:0%
doubling from 5 to 10 years the time a
 
06:16:19.670 --> 06:16:19.680 align:start position:0%
developer can be Exempted from changes
 
06:16:23.350 --> 06:16:23.360 align:start position:0%
in safety codes and other Municipal
 
06:16:26.310 --> 06:16:26.320 align:start position:0%
ordinances if I further know that if
 
06:16:29.670 --> 06:16:29.680 align:start position:0%
after 5 years a developer has not made
 
06:16:32.190 --> 06:16:32.200 align:start position:0%
significant progress then something is
 
06:16:35.390 --> 06:16:35.400 align:start position:0%
going very wrong would I now press the
 
06:16:38.468 --> 06:16:38.478 align:start position:0%
red button to vote non-c concur on
 
06:16:41.628 --> 06:16:41.638 align:start position:0%

06:16:43.868 --> 06:16:43.878 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker chair recognized C
 
06:16:48.548 --> 06:16:48.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:50.708 --> 06:16:50.718 align:start position:0%
inquiry thank you Mr
 
06:16:53.230 --> 06:16:53.240 align:start position:0%
Speaker if I know that the Hampton Beach
 
06:16:55.430 --> 06:16:55.440 align:start position:0%
Casino ballroom has been an engine that
 
06:16:58.030 --> 06:16:58.040 align:start position:0%
has driven economic activity on the Sea
 
06:17:02.510 --> 06:17:02.520 align:start position:0%
Coast and our entire state for 125 years
 
06:17:04.468 --> 06:17:04.478 align:start position:0%
and if I know that the ballroom is has
 
06:17:07.270 --> 06:17:07.280 align:start position:0%
now reached the end of its useful life
 
06:17:09.628 --> 06:17:09.638 align:start position:0%
and if you like me are thrilled that the
 
06:17:12.070 --> 06:17:12.080 align:start position:0%
current owners of the ballroom have
 
06:17:14.548 --> 06:17:14.558 align:start position:0%
committed to redevelop the property at
 
06:17:15.868 --> 06:17:15.878 align:start position:0%
their own
 
06:17:18.548 --> 06:17:18.558 align:start position:0%
expense and that as part of that project
 
06:17:21.190 --> 06:17:21.200 align:start position:0%
the owners wish to integrate property
 
06:17:24.110 --> 06:17:24.120 align:start position:0%
they own on both sides of D Street into
 
06:17:24.120 --> 06:17:24.868 align:start position:0%
they own on both sides of D Street into
their

06:17:24.868 --> 06:17:24.878 align:start position:0%
their
 
06:17:28.190 --> 06:17:28.200 align:start position:0%
design and Mr Speaker if I know that in
 
06:17:30.830 --> 06:17:30.840 align:start position:0%
order to move forward the owners of the
 
06:17:33.350 --> 06:17:33.360 align:start position:0%
ballroom would like Clarity on the
 
06:17:36.350 --> 06:17:36.360 align:start position:0%
disposition of D Street Street and if I
 
06:17:39.548 --> 06:17:39.558 align:start position:0%
know that D Street is a 500t stretch of
 
06:17:42.830 --> 06:17:42.840 align:start position:0%
roadway with very little traffic and no
 
06:17:45.150 --> 06:17:45.160 align:start position:0%
abutters other other than the ballrooms
 
06:17:49.110 --> 06:17:49.120 align:start position:0%
owners and finally Mr Speaker if I know
 
06:17:51.628 --> 06:17:51.638 align:start position:0%
that nothing we do here today should be
 
06:17:54.468 --> 06:17:54.478 align:start position:0%
interpreted as implying approval of the
 
06:17:56.788 --> 06:17:56.798 align:start position:0%
proposed Redevelopment project which
 
06:17:58.788 --> 06:17:58.798 align:start position:0%
will still need to be reviewed by the
 
06:18:00.868 --> 06:18:00.878 align:start position:0%
appropriate local boards before it can
 
06:18:03.310 --> 06:18:03.320 align:start position:0%
proceed would I now press the green
 
06:18:06.350 --> 06:18:06.360 align:start position:0%
button to give the select board the
 
06:18:09.190 --> 06:18:09.200 align:start position:0%
option if they wish to exercise it or
 
06:18:14.070 --> 06:18:14.080 align:start position:0%
not to close that 500t roadway but only
 
06:18:17.190 --> 06:18:17.200 align:start position:0%
after holding five public hearings five
 
06:18:19.190 --> 06:18:19.200 align:start position:0%

toilet um the Senate version part two of
 
06:32:26.590 --> 06:32:26.600 align:start position:0%
this bill uh is a new paragraph with
 
06:32:28.788 --> 06:32:28.798 align:start position:0%
language regarding policies governing a
 
06:32:30.990 --> 06:32:31.000 align:start position:0%

Library at

vague subjective and
 
06:32:43.468 --> 06:32:43.478 align:start position:0%
inconsistent and the importance of this
 
06:32:45.670 --> 06:32:45.680 align:start position:0%
is that it does require proper hearing
 
06:32:49.788 --> 06:32:49.798 align:start position:0%
which has not had so uh this bill if it
 
06:32:52.628 --> 06:32:52.638 align:start position:0%
were to pass with this in uh is
 
06:32:55.070 --> 06:32:55.080 align:start position:0%
unacceptable uh there's terms such as in
 
06:32:57.868 --> 06:32:57.878 align:start position:0%
one place uh you have to report within
 
06:32:59.750 --> 06:32:59.760 align:start position:0%
30 days another place where it says

report within 30 calendar days it's
 
06:33:05.150 --> 06:33:05.160 align:start position:0%

recounts when things go wrong as we know
 
06:34:01.270 --> 06:34:01.280 align:start position:0%
from recent history they do and there
 
06:34:02.708 --> 06:34:02.718 align:start position:0%
was controversy about whether they're
 
06:34:04.708 --> 06:34:04.718 align:start position:0%
even allowed to do a second recount when
 
06:34:07.150 --> 06:34:07.160 align:start position:0%
they knew there was a problem so what we
 
06:34:10.230 --> 06:34:10.240 align:start position:0%
sent over was the fix for that part of
 
06:34:12.948 --> 06:34:12.958 align:start position:0%

06:38:34.150 --> 06:38:34.160 align:start position:0%
Speaker Mr Speaker this bill is a
 
06:38:37.270 --> 06:38:37.280 align:start position:0%
bipartisan Common Sense Bill requiring
 
06:38:39.548 --> 06:38:39.558 align:start position:0%
the disclosure of the use of artificial
 
06:38:42.150 --> 06:38:42.160 align:start position:0%
intelligence as it relates to
 
06:38:46.990 --> 06:38:47.000 align:start position:0%
elections candidates and now election
 
06:38:49.750 --> 06:38:49.760 align:start position:0%
officials this bill passed the house on
 
06:38:52.670 --> 06:38:52.680 align:start position:0%
a Voice vote so strong that we didn't
 
06:38:56.628 --> 06:38:56.638 align:start position:0%
even have to do a division vote for
 
06:38:59.830 --> 06:38:59.840 align:start position:0%
clarification HB 1596 passed the other
 
06:39:03.590 --> 06:39:03.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:39:05.510 --> 06:39:05.520 align:start position:0%
we know the breakdown on the other side
 
06:39:08.070 --> 06:39:08.080 align:start position:0%
of the wall so to pass something
 
06:39:11.510 --> 06:39:11.520 align:start position:0%
unanimously is kind of a big
 
06:39:14.750 --> 06:39:14.760 align:start position:0%
deal there's very minor change to this
 
06:39:17.628 --> 06:39:17.638 align:start position:0%
bill made by the other
 
06:39:21.750 --> 06:39:21.760 align:start position:0%
body it is done by the request of and
 
06:39:25.830 --> 06:39:25.840 align:start position:0%
with the approval of the Secretary of
 
06:39:30.350 --> 06:39:30.360 align:start position:0%
State this bill has enthusiastic support
 
06:39:32.670 --> 06:39:32.680 align:start position:0%
from the Secretary of State and is a
 
06:39:37.070 --> 06:39:37.080 align:start position:0%
high priority Bill the minor changes do
 
06:39:44.030 --> 06:39:44.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:39:47.070 --> 06:39:47.080 align:start position:0%
substantively I I'll keep it
 
06:39:52.230 --> 06:39:52.240 align:start position:0%
brief and just urge the body to vote no
 
06:39:55.230 --> 06:39:55.240 align:start position:0%
on the motion to nonc concur so that
 
06:39:59.110 --> 06:39:59.120 align:start position:0%
another better motion may be made on
 
06:40:03.350 --> 06:40:03.360 align:start position:0%
this Common Sense bipartisan bill that
 
06:40:06.830 --> 06:40:06.840 align:start position:0%
allows voters to know if they are being
 
06:40:10.430 --> 06:40:10.440 align:start position:0%
deceived and manipulated by artificial
 
06:40:13.548 --> 06:40:13.558 align:start position:0%
intelligence technology thank
 
06:40:15.708 --> 06:40:15.718 align:start position:0%
you chair recognize Representative
 
06:40:15.718 --> 06:40:18.868 align:start position:0%
you chair recognize Representative
Steven

06:40:18.868 --> 06:40:18.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:40:21.830 --> 06:40:21.840 align:start position:0%
Smith thank you Mr
 
06:40:28.310 --> 06:40:28.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:40:30.548 --> 06:40:30.558 align:start position:0%
room not nearly
 
06:40:33.150 --> 06:40:33.160 align:start position:0%
enough so here's what happened we send
 
06:40:35.270 --> 06:40:35.280 align:start position:0%
the bill over to the Senate and they
 
06:40:38.310 --> 06:40:38.320 align:start position:0%
made a language change and it was really
 
06:40:40.910 --> 06:40:40.920 align:start position:0%
critical so let's say if somebody does a
 
06:40:43.350 --> 06:40:43.360 align:start position:0%
deep fake you guys might be looking at
 
06:40:45.030 --> 06:40:45.040 align:start position:0%
political ads or be serve them I don't
 
06:40:48.150 --> 06:40:48.160 align:start position:0%
know just a guess and you go oh my God
 
06:40:50.070 --> 06:40:50.080 align:start position:0%
look at this this information is
 
06:40:53.310 --> 06:40:53.320 align:start position:0%
terrible I'm going to repost that you
 
06:40:55.030 --> 06:40:55.040 align:start position:0%
know what you just did with your finger
 
06:40:56.548 --> 06:40:56.558 align:start position:0%
with the language that we got back from
 
06:40:58.750 --> 06:40:58.760 align:start position:0%
the Senate probably exposed yourself to
 
06:41:01.190 --> 06:41:01.200 align:start position:0%
lawsuits penalties why should you be
 
06:41:02.670 --> 06:41:02.680 align:start position:0%
liable you're not even the one that
 
06:41:04.430 --> 06:41:04.440 align:start position:0%
created it
 
06:41:07.070 --> 06:41:07.080 align:start position:0%
now why wouldn't I just go to a
 
06:41:08.990 --> 06:41:09.000 align:start position:0%
committee of conference and argue my
 
06:41:11.990 --> 06:41:12.000 align:start position:0%
case here's the real problem very smart
 
06:41:14.190 --> 06:41:14.200 align:start position:0%
people who know about it and I do know a
 
06:41:18.788 --> 06:41:18.798 align:start position:0%
few lawyers judges tech people they have
 
06:41:21.150 --> 06:41:21.160 align:start position:0%
differing opinions on whether or not the
 
06:41:23.868 --> 06:41:23.878 align:start position:0%
language actually does that I don't know
 
06:41:26.110 --> 06:41:26.120 align:start position:0%
who I have to get in the room to figure
 
06:41:27.910 --> 06:41:27.920 align:start position:0%
this out but I do not believe that I can
 
06:41:29.910 --> 06:41:29.920 align:start position:0%
do it in the what six days that we have
 
06:41:33.830 --> 06:41:33.840 align:start position:0%
left so we already passed some
 
06:41:36.430 --> 06:41:36.440 align:start position:0%
this one I'm unwilling to vote for it
 
06:41:39.628 --> 06:41:39.638 align:start position:0%
knowing whether or not for sure I am
 
06:41:41.990 --> 06:41:42.000 align:start position:0%
putting regular people who have no clue
 
06:41:45.468 --> 06:41:45.478 align:start position:0%
at risk just because their finger got
 
06:41:48.868 --> 06:41:48.878 align:start position:0%
them sued so I'm not going to say what I
 
06:41:50.468 --> 06:41:50.478 align:start position:0%
really want to say there I'm urging you
 
06:41:54.750 --> 06:41:54.760 align:start position:0%
to support the non-c Concur and not put
 
06:41:58.190 --> 06:41:58.200 align:start position:0%
those people at risk thank you Mr
 
06:42:00.868 --> 06:42:00.878 align:start position:0%

Speaker if I know that only those who

create the Deep fake are liable under
 
06:43:33.910 --> 06:43:33.920 align:start position:0%
this bill and not those who use their
 
06:43:36.948 --> 06:43:36.958 align:start position:0%
finger to post something on Facebook and
 
06:43:40.030 --> 06:43:40.040 align:start position:0%
if I know that the SOS supports this
 
06:43:43.510 --> 06:43:43.520 align:start position:0%
bill and it was the result of a barish
 
06:43:47.510 --> 06:43:47.520 align:start position:0%
bipartisan effort and if I know that we
 
06:43:51.628 --> 06:43:51.638 align:start position:0%
voted on this very same bill with varies
 
06:43:55.628 --> 06:43:55.638 align:start position:0%
minor CH this same bill essentially
 
06:43:58.788 --> 06:43:58.798 align:start position:0%
weeks ago then would I not then would I

that in the protections that were put in
 
06:44:28.468 --> 06:44:28.478 align:start position:0%
the bill the Senate carved out the word

users that's you and your constituents
 
06:44:34.628 --> 06:44:34.638 align:start position:0%
and Mr Speaker if I I have trepidation
 
06:44:37.270 --> 06:44:37.280 align:start position:0%
about whether or not striking that out
 
06:44:40.510 --> 06:44:40.520 align:start position:0%

provision into our state constitution we
 
06:49:38.708 --> 06:49:38.718 align:start position:0%
are all naturally interested in in fully
 
06:49:42.030 --> 06:49:42.040 align:start position:0%
vetting this measure cacr 13's original
 
06:49:44.670 --> 06:49:44.680 align:start position:0%
language sought to prohibit not only
 
06:49:48.868 --> 06:49:48.878 align:start position:0%
slavery but also quote involuntary
 
06:49:48.878 --> 06:49:50.548 align:start position:0%
slavery but also quote involuntary
servitude

06:49:50.548 --> 06:49:50.558 align:start position:0%
servitude
 
06:49:53.788 --> 06:49:53.798 align:start position:0%
unquote now our us Constitution's 13th
 
06:49:57.468 --> 06:49:57.478 align:start position:0%
Amendment is as you all know should know
 
06:50:01.548 --> 06:50:01.558 align:start position:0%
already abolished involuntary servitude
 
06:50:01.558 --> 06:50:03.070 align:start position:0%
already abolished involuntary servitude
except

06:50:03.070 --> 06:50:03.080 align:start position:0%
except
 
06:50:06.910 --> 06:50:06.920 align:start position:0%
except as quote a punishment for a crime
 
06:50:08.990 --> 06:50:09.000 align:start position:0%
whereof the party shall have been duly
 
06:50:09.000 --> 06:50:10.310 align:start position:0%
whereof the party shall have been duly
convicted

06:50:10.310 --> 06:50:10.320 align:start position:0%
convicted
 
06:50:14.948 --> 06:50:14.958 align:start position:0%
unquote ca ca cacr 13's language would
 
06:50:17.150 --> 06:50:17.160 align:start position:0%
do away with the 13th amendment's
 
06:50:19.110 --> 06:50:19.120 align:start position:0%
involuntary servitude
 
06:50:21.830 --> 06:50:21.840 align:start position:0%
language for New
 
06:50:24.350 --> 06:50:24.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and this was problematical for
 
06:50:27.910 --> 06:50:27.920 align:start position:0%
some folks uh so in that if we amend our
 
06:50:30.510 --> 06:50:30.520 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Constitution to preclude
 
06:50:33.830 --> 06:50:33.840 align:start position:0%
the work mandates for the incarcerated
 
06:50:36.510 --> 06:50:36.520 align:start position:0%
would would be opening a Pandora's box
 
06:50:37.788 --> 06:50:37.798 align:start position:0%
of potential
 
06:50:40.510 --> 06:50:40.520 align:start position:0%
lawsuits against the state on behalf of
 
06:50:43.830 --> 06:50:43.840 align:start position:0%
incarcerated persons For Whom the state
 
06:50:46.430 --> 06:50:46.440 align:start position:0%
might have certain work requirements as
 
06:50:49.788 --> 06:50:49.798 align:start position:0%
part of Rehabilitation process processes
 
06:50:52.868 --> 06:50:52.878 align:start position:0%
so our committee put things on hold
 
06:50:54.750 --> 06:50:54.760 align:start position:0%
until we could communicate with the
 
06:50:56.150 --> 06:50:56.160 align:start position:0%
commissioner of
 
06:50:58.070 --> 06:50:58.080 align:start position:0%
Corrections who better than the
 
06:51:01.110 --> 06:51:01.120 align:start position:0%
commissioner of Corrections to to to go
 
06:51:03.788 --> 06:51:03.798 align:start position:0%
to on this we laid things out for the
 
06:51:06.350 --> 06:51:06.360 align:start position:0%
commissioner and requested a response
 
06:51:08.830 --> 06:51:08.840 align:start position:0%
she wrote back and stated that she was
 
06:51:12.310 --> 06:51:12.320 align:start position:0%
okay with the language of cacr
 
06:51:15.350 --> 06:51:15.360 align:start position:0%
13 that meant a lot so given that input
 
06:51:16.788 --> 06:51:16.798 align:start position:0%
from the corrections commissioner our
 
06:51:19.548 --> 06:51:19.558 align:start position:0%
committee proceeded to recommend uh to
 
06:51:23.030 --> 06:51:23.040 align:start position:0%
pass regarding C cacr
 
06:51:25.750 --> 06:51:25.760 align:start position:0%
13 the Full House this Full House did
 
06:51:27.310 --> 06:51:27.320 align:start position:0%
also did likewise and the measure went
 
06:51:28.628 --> 06:51:28.638 align:start position:0%
on to the other
 
06:51:31.548 --> 06:51:31.558 align:start position:0%
body however during the other bod's
 
06:51:33.070 --> 06:51:33.080 align:start position:0%
subsequent Eda
 
06:51:36.350 --> 06:51:36.360 align:start position:0%
Edna hearings on cacr 13 there were
 
06:51:39.628 --> 06:51:39.638 align:start position:0%
significant blowback lots of testimony
 
06:51:43.070 --> 06:51:43.080 align:start position:0%
indicating serious concern again on how
 
06:51:44.910 --> 06:51:44.920 align:start position:0%
the elimination of the prison work
 
06:51:47.628 --> 06:51:47.638 align:start position:0%
requirement could be problematical
 
06:51:50.110 --> 06:51:50.120 align:start position:0%
indeed uh this went back to our earlier
 
06:51:52.310 --> 06:51:52.320 align:start position:0%
concerns that the corre corrections
 
06:51:56.150 --> 06:51:56.160 align:start position:0%
commissioner addressed for us so again
 
06:51:58.350 --> 06:51:58.360 align:start position:0%
the question was would this put our New
 
06:52:00.230 --> 06:52:00.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Constitution at odds with our
 
06:52:03.510 --> 06:52:03.520 align:start position:0%
Federal Constitution V Visa a v
 
06:52:03.520 --> 06:52:05.590 align:start position:0%
Federal Constitution V Visa a v
involuntary

06:52:05.590 --> 06:52:05.600 align:start position:0%
involuntary
 
06:52:09.110 --> 06:52:09.120 align:start position:0%
servitude now so the what the Senate
 
06:52:13.430 --> 06:52:13.440 align:start position:0%
recommended was to Simply amend cacr 13
 
06:52:16.868 --> 06:52:16.878 align:start position:0%
and have it emulate and use the exact
 
06:52:19.150 --> 06:52:19.160 align:start position:0%
same language that's in the 13th amend
 
06:52:21.750 --> 06:52:21.760 align:start position:0%
Amendment to the Federal Constitution so
 
06:52:24.190 --> 06:52:24.200 align:start position:0%
initially that was something that I was
 
06:52:28.150 --> 06:52:28.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:52:31.910 --> 06:52:31.920 align:start position:0%
member but the measures sponsors and
 
06:52:34.590 --> 06:52:34.600 align:start position:0%
stakehold olders made it very clear that
 
06:52:36.910 --> 06:52:36.920 align:start position:0%
the Senate language was unacceptable to
 
06:52:39.430 --> 06:52:39.440 align:start position:0%
them and a majority of our committee
 
06:52:39.440 --> 06:52:42.070 align:start position:0%
them and a majority of our committee
members

06:52:42.070 --> 06:52:42.080 align:start position:0%
members
 
06:52:45.270 --> 06:52:45.280 align:start position:0%
agreed so instead of a concur
 
06:52:47.310 --> 06:52:47.320 align:start position:0%
recommendation we considered we
 
06:52:49.388 --> 06:52:49.398 align:start position:0%
considered a non-c concur with a request
 
06:52:52.830 --> 06:52:52.840 align:start position:0%
for a committee of conference but
 
06:52:54.990 --> 06:52:55.000 align:start position:0%
subsequent communication made it clear
 
06:52:57.548 --> 06:52:57.558 align:start position:0%
that the other body was unlikely to
 
06:53:00.270 --> 06:53:00.280 align:start position:0%
yield to any further compromised
 
06:53:02.510 --> 06:53:02.520 align:start position:0%
language and the sponsors in
 
06:53:06.430 --> 06:53:06.440 align:start position:0%
stakeholders also made it quite clear
 
06:53:08.868 --> 06:53:08.878 align:start position:0%
that they were also unlikely to yield to
 
06:53:10.868 --> 06:53:10.878 align:start position:0%
any language
 
06:53:14.190 --> 06:53:14.200 align:start position:0%
changes so it was quite apparent that a
 
06:53:16.910 --> 06:53:16.920 align:start position:0%
committee of conference would be likely
 
06:53:18.750 --> 06:53:18.760 align:start position:0%
fruitless so this leaves us with this
 
06:53:20.628 --> 06:53:20.638 align:start position:0%
recommendation to non-c concur with the
 
06:53:22.788 --> 06:53:22.798 align:start position:0%
other bod's amending language which
 
06:53:24.948 --> 06:53:24.958 align:start position:0%
would effective this would effectively
 
06:53:27.868 --> 06:53:27.878 align:start position:0%
kill this measure for this term the ca
 
06:53:30.670 --> 06:53:30.680 align:start position:0%
cacr supporters understand that they're
 
06:53:32.110 --> 06:53:32.120 align:start position:0%
aware of this and we understand that
 
06:53:34.388 --> 06:53:34.398 align:start position:0%
they very well may try again next term
 
06:53:37.070 --> 06:53:37.080 align:start position:0%
with the language with which they are
 
06:53:39.310 --> 06:53:39.320 align:start position:0%
committed to so all that said I would
 
06:53:41.750 --> 06:53:41.760 align:start position:0%
encourage my colleagues to support our
 
06:53:46.070 --> 06:53:46.080 align:start position:0%
non-c concur recommendation thank you Mr
 
06:53:48.230 --> 06:53:48.240 align:start position:0%
Speaker the question is whether to non-c
 
06:53:50.830 --> 06:53:50.840 align:start position:0%
concur on cacr 13 are you ready for the
 
06:53:54.110 --> 06:53:54.120 align:start position:0%
question all those in favor say I I all
 
06:53:57.110 --> 06:53:57.120 align:start position:0%

adoption of the amendment to the
 
06:54:08.150 --> 06:54:08.160 align:start position:0%
following title bill from sent up from
 
06:54:10.990 --> 06:54:11.000 align:start position:0%
the house Senate Bill 249 establishing
 
06:54:12.708 --> 06:54:12.718 align:start position:0%
magistrates in relative to release of
 
06:54:14.670 --> 06:54:14.680 align:start position:0%
persons pending resolution of criminal
 
06:54:16.548 --> 06:54:16.558 align:start position:0%
charges and request a committee of
 
06:54:18.070 --> 06:54:18.080 align:start position:0%
conference the president on the part of
 
06:54:19.628 --> 06:54:19.638 align:start position:0%
the Senate has appointed as members of
 
06:54:21.830 --> 06:54:21.840 align:start position:0%

Susi representative rhs
 
06:54:42.150 --> 06:54:42.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:54:44.948 --> 06:54:44.958 align:start position:0%
speak thank you Mr
 
06:54:47.590 --> 06:54:47.600 align:start position:0%
Speaker Mr Speaker
 
06:54:51.910 --> 06:54:51.920 align:start position:0%
uh this bill is the one of the many many
 
06:54:53.670 --> 06:54:53.680 align:start position:0%
bail bills that we heard in our
 
06:54:57.150 --> 06:54:57.160 align:start position:0%
committee and we have already asked for
 
06:54:59.948 --> 06:54:59.958 align:start position:0%
a committee of conference for that
 
06:55:02.270 --> 06:55:02.280 align:start position:0%
plethora of bail bills this particular
 
06:55:05.670 --> 06:55:05.680 align:start position:0%
ular bail bill um has to do with
 
06:55:09.310 --> 06:55:09.320 align:start position:0%
magistrates and the big old bill that we
 
06:55:12.190 --> 06:55:12.200 align:start position:0%
sent over to the senate had magistrates
 
06:55:14.110 --> 06:55:14.120 align:start position:0%
in there and they sent it back to us and
 
06:55:17.468 --> 06:55:17.478 align:start position:0%
said no magistrates for you so then we
 
06:55:20.030 --> 06:55:20.040 align:start position:0%
went and said look you got to do better
 
06:55:21.628 --> 06:55:21.638 align:start position:0%
so they did they gave us three
 
06:55:23.948 --> 06:55:23.958 align:start position:0%
magistrates so I don't really see the
 
06:55:26.388 --> 06:55:26.398 align:start position:0%
point of going to another Committee of
 
06:55:28.270 --> 06:55:28.280 align:start position:0%
conference and we already have one that
 
06:55:29.510 --> 06:55:29.520 align:start position:0%
we're going to get this thing hammered
 
06:55:33.628 --> 06:55:33.638 align:start position:0%
out so please let's just done with
 
06:55:35.788 --> 06:55:35.798 align:start position:0%
it the question is whether the house
 
06:55:38.388 --> 06:55:38.398 align:start position:0%
will refuse to exceed on Senate Bill 249
 
06:55:40.388 --> 06:55:40.398 align:start position:0%
you ready for the question all those in
 
06:55:44.468 --> 06:55:44.478 align:start position:0%
favor say I I all those oppos nay eyes
 
06:55:47.468 --> 06:55:47.478 align:start position:0%
have it and the motion's adopted chair
 
06:55:49.230 --> 06:55:49.240 align:start position:0%
recognizes the clerk for further Senate
 
06:55:51.430 --> 06:55:51.440 align:start position:0%
messages Mr Speaker the Senate refuses
 
06:55:53.030 --> 06:55:53.040 align:start position:0%
to concur with the house in the adoption
 
06:55:54.388 --> 06:55:54.398 align:start position:0%
of the amendment to the following title
 
06:55:56.030 --> 06:55:56.040 align:start position:0%
bill sent up from the house Senate Bill

to
 
06:56:19.990 --> 06:56:20.000 align:start position:0%
speak thank you Mr
 
06:56:24.868 --> 06:56:24.878 align:start position:0%
Speaker Senate Bill 460 came to us
 
06:56:28.910 --> 06:56:28.920 align:start position:0%
and trying to regulate and make some
 
06:56:32.388 --> 06:56:32.398 align:start position:0%
some changes around the drones and they
 
06:56:35.110 --> 06:56:35.120 align:start position:0%
started with misdemeanor so it went
 
06:56:38.350 --> 06:56:38.360 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor misdemeanor felony felony we
 
06:56:40.510 --> 06:56:40.520 align:start position:0%
said that seems a little bit harsh
 
06:56:42.510 --> 06:56:42.520 align:start position:0%
didn't change the underlining bill at
 
06:56:44.830 --> 06:56:44.840 align:start position:0%
all left everything in there instead of
 
06:56:47.110 --> 06:56:47.120 align:start position:0%
going from a misdemeanor or straight to
 
06:56:48.670 --> 06:56:48.680 align:start position:0%
a misdemeanor straight to a felony we
 
06:56:51.230 --> 06:56:51.240 align:start position:0%
said hey how about a violation and then
 
06:56:53.788 --> 06:56:53.798 align:start position:0%
maybe a misdemeanor and then a felony
 
06:56:55.670 --> 06:56:55.680 align:start position:0%
they said no that's too egregious so I

members of said committee Senators
 
06:57:46.868 --> 06:57:46.878 align:start position:0%

representative RADS moves that the house

06:57:58.190 --> 06:57:58.200 align:start position:0%
speak thank you Mr Speaker and we also
 
06:58:02.110 --> 06:58:02.120 align:start position:0%
refuse to agree with the Senate um
 
06:58:04.430 --> 06:58:04.440 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 504 is the bill that we
 
06:58:06.868 --> 06:58:06.878 align:start position:0%
started out with this morning and the
 
06:58:10.150 --> 06:58:10.160 align:start position:0%
house voted to not concur not to
 
06:58:12.388 --> 06:58:12.398 align:start position:0%
anything that bill is dead the other
 
06:58:14.350 --> 06:58:14.360 align:start position:0%
bill that they decided attach to it came
 
06:58:16.670 --> 06:58:16.680 align:start position:0%
out of Municipal and came out with an
 
06:58:18.948 --> 06:58:18.958 align:start position:0%
itl recommendation that passed this
 
06:58:21.548 --> 06:58:21.558 align:start position:0%
house so now I have two bills that
 
06:58:23.788 --> 06:58:23.798 align:start position:0%
neither one passed the house so I don't
 
06:58:25.750 --> 06:58:25.760 align:start position:0%
really imagine what magic trick we're
 
06:58:26.948 --> 06:58:26.958 align:start position:0%
supposed to pull out of our hat at a
 
06:58:28.708 --> 06:58:28.718 align:start position:0%
committee of conference but my
 
06:58:29.750 --> 06:58:29.760 align:start position:0%
understanding the rules say we don't
 
06:58:31.788 --> 06:58:31.798 align:start position:0%
want that bill so let's not go to a
 
06:58:34.708 --> 06:58:34.718 align:start position:0%
committee conference on that
 
06:58:36.750 --> 06:58:36.760 align:start position:0%
either the motion is that the house
 
06:58:39.230 --> 06:58:39.240 align:start position:0%

that
 
07:21:29.468 --> 07:21:29.478 align:start position:0%
day I was asked by two reps if I
 
07:21:36.590 --> 07:21:36.600 align:start position:0%
 
07:21:39.110 --> 07:21:39.120 align:start position:0%
let's keep in mind that back then it was
 
07:21:42.868 --> 07:21:42.878 align:start position:0%
around 2008 2009 and my carpentry
 
07:21:47.830 --> 07:21:47.840 align:start position:0%
business just died due to the banking
 
07:21:50.150 --> 07:21:50.160 align:start position:0%
crash also my bank was about to
 
07:21:53.350 --> 07:21:53.360 align:start position:0%
foreclose on my home and these reps were
 
07:21:56.070 --> 07:21:56.080 align:start position:0%
asking me if I wanted to take a job for
 
07:22:00.788 --> 07:22:00.798 align:start position:0%
$100 a year yeah right
 
07:22:03.030 --> 07:22:03.040 align:start position:0%
instead I learned how to drive big rigs
 
07:22:06.548 --> 07:22:06.558 align:start position:0%
and drove Long Haul for 5 years driving
 
07:22:08.670 --> 07:22:08.680 align:start position:0%
over 550,000
 
07:22:11.750 --> 07:22:11.760 align:start position:0%
miles during that time I thought a lot
 
07:22:15.230 --> 07:22:15.240 align:start position:0%
about the idea of running for
 
07:22:18.830 --> 07:22:18.840 align:start position:0%
office after driving for five years I
 
07:22:21.628 --> 07:22:21.638 align:start position:0%
settled in the city of summersworth I
 
07:22:23.708 --> 07:22:23.718 align:start position:0%

07:22:27.948 --> 07:22:27.958 align:start position:0%
