for your committee on legislative
 
00:09:59.839 --> 00:10:01.030 align:start position:0%
for your committee on legislative
continuity

00:10:01.030 --> 00:10:01.040 align:start position:0%
continuity
 
00:10:02.710 --> 00:10:02.720 align:start position:0%
the duties of the committee were to
 
00:10:04.630 --> 00:10:04.640 align:start position:0%
investigate any necessary
 
00:10:07.910 --> 00:10:07.920 align:start position:0%
legislation change in house rules or
 
00:10:10.310 --> 00:10:10.320 align:start position:0%
possible constitutional amendment
 
00:10:12.550 --> 00:10:12.560 align:start position:0%
the committee met once briefly over the
 
00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:13.350 align:start position:0%
the committee met once briefly over the
phone

00:10:13.350 --> 00:10:13.360 align:start position:0%
phone
 
00:10:15.590 --> 00:10:15.600 align:start position:0%
a subsequent meeting was canceled and no
 
00:10:17.030 --> 00:10:17.040 align:start position:0%
other meetings
 
00:10:18.790 --> 00:10:18.800 align:start position:0%
of the continuity committee have
 
00:10:21.590 --> 00:10:21.600 align:start position:0%
occurred we had a chance to meet work on
 
00:10:22.310 --> 00:10:22.320 align:start position:0%
these issues
 
00:10:25.110 --> 00:10:25.120 align:start position:0%
identify priorities and build consensus
 
00:10:27.350 --> 00:10:27.360 align:start position:0%
within our respective caucuses
 
00:10:30.310 --> 00:10:30.320 align:start position:0%
based on the committee's bipartisan work
 
00:10:31.350 --> 00:10:31.360 align:start position:0%
it appears
 
00:10:33.910 --> 00:10:33.920 align:start position:0%
as if the process was abandoned and you
 
00:10:36.069 --> 00:10:36.079 align:start position:0%
made decisions exclusively with your
 
00:10:37.350 --> 00:10:37.360 align:start position:0%
leadership team
 
00:10:39.350 --> 00:10:39.360 align:start position:0%
and told us what you decided to do or
 
00:10:41.990 --> 00:10:42.000 align:start position:0%
not to after those decisions had already
 
00:10:42.949 --> 00:10:42.959 align:start position:0%
been made
 
00:10:45.030 --> 00:10:45.040 align:start position:0%
this was not how this was supposed to
 
00:10:47.509 --> 00:10:47.519 align:start position:0%
work when republicans supported the
 
00:10:48.470 --> 00:10:48.480 align:start position:0%
change to
 
00:10:51.190 --> 00:10:51.200 align:start position:0%
to rule 65b it was with the
 
00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:52.310 align:start position:0%
to rule 65b it was with the
understanding

00:10:52.310 --> 00:10:52.320 align:start position:0%
understanding
 
00:10:54.790 --> 00:10:54.800 align:start position:0%
that you were acting in good faith and
 
00:10:56.310 --> 00:10:56.320 align:start position:0%
would include republicans
 
00:10:59.190 --> 00:10:59.200 align:start position:0%
in this crisis response process it was
 
00:10:59.670 --> 00:10:59.680 align:start position:0%
with the
 
00:11:02.069 --> 00:11:02.079 align:start position:0%
understand that understanding that you
 
00:11:03.829 --> 00:11:03.839 align:start position:0%
would proactively seek
 
00:11:05.509 --> 00:11:05.519 align:start position:0%
republican input to achieve the
 
00:11:07.190 --> 00:11:07.200 align:start position:0%
concurrence required
 
00:11:10.710 --> 00:11:10.720 align:start position:0%
in 65 d we have seen very little attempt
 
00:11:13.350 --> 00:11:13.360 align:start position:0%
at seeking republican input via the
 
00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:13.990 align:start position:0%
at seeking republican input via the
community

00:11:13.990 --> 00:11:14.000 align:start position:0%
community
 
00:11:16.550 --> 00:11:16.560 align:start position:0%
committee and rather than work within
 
00:11:17.269 --> 00:11:17.279 align:start position:0%
the terms
 
00:11:20.870 --> 00:11:20.880 align:start position:0%
of 65b we now cnn run around it by
 
00:11:22.670 --> 00:11:22.680 align:start position:0%
proposing this amendment
 
00:11:25.670 --> 00:11:25.680 align:start position:0%
65a mr speaker we have a number
 
00:11:28.069 --> 00:11:28.079 align:start position:0%
concerned about the proposed schedule
 
00:11:31.190 --> 00:11:31.200 align:start position:0%
in your 65a amendment it sets forth a
 
00:11:32.069 --> 00:11:32.079 align:start position:0%
very quick time
 
00:11:34.470 --> 00:11:34.480 align:start position:0%
frame for public hearings we are not
 
00:11:36.389 --> 00:11:36.399 align:start position:0%
fully briefed on how these hearings will
 
00:11:36.399 --> 00:11:37.190 align:start position:0%
fully briefed on how these hearings will
occur

00:11:37.190 --> 00:11:37.200 align:start position:0%
occur
 
00:11:39.350 --> 00:11:39.360 align:start position:0%
but we can only assume at this point
 
00:11:40.949 --> 00:11:40.959 align:start position:0%
they will be remote
 
00:11:43.110 --> 00:11:43.120 align:start position:0%
as we all know the house held its first
 
00:11:44.630 --> 00:11:44.640 align:start position:0%
remote public hearing
 
00:11:46.710 --> 00:11:46.720 align:start position:0%
on a bill yesterday and there were
 
00:11:49.030 --> 00:11:49.040 align:start position:0%
several concerns brought to my attention
 
00:11:51.829 --> 00:11:51.839 align:start position:0%
about its extended time to complete
 
00:11:51.839 --> 00:11:52.389 align:start position:0%
about its extended time to complete
function

00:11:52.389 --> 00:11:52.399 align:start position:0%
function
 
00:11:55.269 --> 00:11:55.279 align:start position:0%
and execution how can we reliably
 
00:11:56.790 --> 00:11:56.800 align:start position:0%
administer dozens
 
00:12:00.150 --> 00:12:00.160 align:start position:0%
of these hearings in a short time frame
 
00:12:02.150 --> 00:12:02.160 align:start position:0%
republicans have a road map forward we
 
00:12:04.389 --> 00:12:04.399 align:start position:0%
have a realistic and comprehensive
 
00:12:06.629 --> 00:12:06.639 align:start position:0%
set of dates for deadlines that we
 
00:12:08.470 --> 00:12:08.480 align:start position:0%
believe meets the needs of a thorough
 
00:12:10.310 --> 00:12:10.320 align:start position:0%
legislative process
 
00:12:12.790 --> 00:12:12.800 align:start position:0%
we are not here to obstruct we agree
 
00:12:14.389 --> 00:12:14.399 align:start position:0%
that the people's work needs to be
 
00:12:14.399 --> 00:12:15.350 align:start position:0%
that the people's work needs to be
addressed

00:12:15.350 --> 00:12:15.360 align:start position:0%
addressed
 
00:12:18.150 --> 00:12:18.160 align:start position:0%
but we are here to ensure the spirit of
 
00:12:20.230 --> 00:12:20.240 align:start position:0%
bipartisan cooperation
 
00:12:24.310 --> 00:12:24.320 align:start position:0%
the spirit of 65b is not pushed aside
 
00:12:27.509 --> 00:12:27.519 align:start position:0%
during this pandemic i think we all know
 
00:12:29.509 --> 00:12:29.519 align:start position:0%
where this is going mr speaker
 
00:12:31.509 --> 00:12:31.519 align:start position:0%
perhaps if the continuity committee
 
00:12:33.829 --> 00:12:33.839 align:start position:0%
meets sometime in the future
 
00:12:35.829 --> 00:12:35.839 align:start position:0%
we can work these things out rather than
 
00:12:36.870 --> 00:12:36.880 align:start position:0%
be presented
 
00:12:39.110 --> 00:12:39.120 align:start position:0%
with an all-or-nothing vote on one
 
00:12:40.949 --> 00:12:40.959 align:start position:0%
party's proposed dates
 
00:12:43.269 --> 00:12:43.279 align:start position:0%

some comments
 
00:13:41.670 --> 00:13:41.680 align:start position:0%
um in response to my colleagues comments
 
00:13:43.350 --> 00:13:43.360 align:start position:0%
my understanding of the legislative
 
00:13:44.949 --> 00:13:44.959 align:start position:0%
continuity committee
 
00:13:47.030 --> 00:13:47.040 align:start position:0%
uh was that the legislative continuity
 
00:13:48.230 --> 00:13:48.240 align:start position:0%
committee was to
 
00:13:51.269 --> 00:13:51.279 align:start position:0%
deal with long-range issues involving
 
00:13:53.829 --> 00:13:53.839 align:start position:0%
uh processes of the house in particular
 
00:13:55.590 --> 00:13:55.600 align:start position:0%
uh things such as constitutional
 
00:13:57.350 --> 00:13:57.360 align:start position:0%
amendments etc
 
00:13:59.750 --> 00:13:59.760 align:start position:0%
there was never any understanding that
 
00:14:01.590 --> 00:14:01.600 align:start position:0%
the legislative continuity committee was
 
00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:01.990 align:start position:0%
the legislative continuity committee was
actually

00:14:01.990 --> 00:14:02.000 align:start position:0%
actually
 
00:14:04.389 --> 00:14:04.399 align:start position:0%
a committee to arrange bipartisan
 
00:14:06.310 --> 00:14:06.320 align:start position:0%
agreement on policy issues
 
00:14:07.750 --> 00:14:07.760 align:start position:0%
that was not the intent of that
 
00:14:09.509 --> 00:14:09.519 align:start position:0%
committee and actually in the letter
 
00:14:10.230 --> 00:14:10.240 align:start position:0%
that um
 
00:14:12.230 --> 00:14:12.240 align:start position:0%
or in the email that the uh my good
 
00:14:13.350 --> 00:14:13.360 align:start position:0%
friend just read
 
00:14:15.829 --> 00:14:15.839 align:start position:0%
there's no mention of any sort of uh
 
00:14:17.910 --> 00:14:17.920 align:start position:0%
policy issues to be discussed
 
00:14:20.069 --> 00:14:20.079 align:start position:0%
nor was there on the floor of the house
 
00:14:23.750 --> 00:14:23.760 align:start position:0%
um at the time nor is there in rule 65b
 
00:14:26.389 --> 00:14:26.399 align:start position:0%
having said that um there was con
 
00:14:27.990 --> 00:14:28.000 align:start position:0%
consultation with
 
00:14:32.069 --> 00:14:32.079 align:start position:0%
um members of of of my good friends uh
 
00:14:34.790 --> 00:14:34.800 align:start position:0%
uh party um and i would just simply note
 
00:14:35.509 --> 00:14:35.519 align:start position:0%
that um
 
00:14:38.710 --> 00:14:38.720 align:start position:0%
of the fifth of the 20 uh policy
 
00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:39.750 align:start position:0%
of the fifth of the 20 uh policy
committees

00:14:39.750 --> 00:14:39.760 align:start position:0%
committees
 
00:14:44.069 --> 00:14:44.079 align:start position:0%
that um uh i i would consider here
 
00:14:47.030 --> 00:14:47.040 align:start position:0%
two made no recommendations in terms of
 
00:14:48.870 --> 00:14:48.880 align:start position:0%
bills but of the remaining
 
00:14:52.069 --> 00:14:52.079 align:start position:0%
uh 18 uh three committees
 
00:14:53.990 --> 00:14:54.000 align:start position:0%
okay did not there did not seem to be
 
00:14:56.310 --> 00:14:56.320 align:start position:0%
much consultation but that means and
 
00:14:59.509 --> 00:14:59.519 align:start position:0%
15 of the 20 committees there was
 
00:15:01.430 --> 00:15:01.440 align:start position:0%
consultation between the committee chair
 
00:15:03.030 --> 00:15:03.040 align:start position:0%
committee vice chair and the ranking
 
00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:03.829 align:start position:0%
committee vice chair and the ranking
member

00:15:03.829 --> 00:15:03.839 align:start position:0%
member
 
00:15:05.509 --> 00:15:05.519 align:start position:0%
and on eight of those committees there
 
00:15:06.870 --> 00:15:06.880 align:start position:0%
was extensive
 
00:15:09.110 --> 00:15:09.120 align:start position:0%
uh communication between the ranking
 
00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:09.910 align:start position:0%
uh communication between the ranking
member

00:15:09.910 --> 00:15:09.920 align:start position:0%
member
 
00:15:12.710 --> 00:15:12.720 align:start position:0%
and the committee chair so much so that
 
00:15:14.629 --> 00:15:14.639 align:start position:0%
the ranking member contributed to
 
00:15:16.949 --> 00:15:16.959 align:start position:0%
in many cases the completion and the
 
00:15:18.949 --> 00:15:18.959 align:start position:0%
development of the so-called priority
 
00:15:19.829 --> 00:15:19.839 align:start position:0%
bill list
 
00:15:21.430 --> 00:15:21.440 align:start position:0%
so the notion that there's been no
 
00:15:23.990 --> 00:15:24.000 align:start position:0%
consultation is a false claim
 
00:15:25.670 --> 00:15:25.680 align:start position:0%
to also claim that there has been no
 
00:15:27.269 --> 00:15:27.279 align:start position:0%
communication between
 
00:15:29.829 --> 00:15:29.839 align:start position:0%
uh the democratic leadership and my
 
00:15:30.710 --> 00:15:30.720 align:start position:0%
friend's uh
 
00:15:32.790 --> 00:15:32.800 align:start position:0%
leadership as well is also a false claim
 
00:15:34.470 --> 00:15:34.480 align:start position:0%
i would i think or at least a mistaken
 
00:15:36.150 --> 00:15:36.160 align:start position:0%
claim i will say that i i take back it
 
00:15:38.310 --> 00:15:38.320 align:start position:0%
is not a false claim it is mistaken
 
00:15:40.389 --> 00:15:40.399 align:start position:0%
um because i believe that there has been
 
00:15:42.310 --> 00:15:42.320 align:start position:0%
uh repeated communication between the
 
00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:43.110 align:start position:0%
uh repeated communication between the
speaker

00:15:43.110 --> 00:15:43.120 align:start position:0%
speaker
 
00:15:45.350 --> 00:15:45.360 align:start position:0%
um and members of my good friend's
 
00:15:46.629 --> 00:15:46.639 align:start position:0%
leadership team
 
00:15:49.269 --> 00:15:49.279 align:start position:0%
so to make these sorts of accusations
 
00:15:51.350 --> 00:15:51.360 align:start position:0%
and claims is simply uh
 
00:15:53.829 --> 00:15:53.839 align:start position:0%
an error i believe um which i hope my
 
00:15:54.710 --> 00:15:54.720 align:start position:0%
friend will correct
 
00:15:58.389 --> 00:15:58.399 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative lay
 
00:16:02.150 --> 00:16:02.160 align:start position:0%

00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:04.629 align:start position:0%
um further discussion uh representative
hinge

00:16:04.629 --> 00:16:04.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:07.350 --> 00:16:07.360 align:start position:0%
thank you um i would i don't want to get
 
00:16:08.949 --> 00:16:08.959 align:start position:0%
into a debate on this that's not going
 
00:16:10.949 --> 00:16:10.959 align:start position:0%
to be productive at all for us
 
00:16:13.350 --> 00:16:13.360 align:start position:0%
but i would call uh representative lay's
 
00:16:14.550 --> 00:16:14.560 align:start position:0%
attention to the
 
00:16:18.230 --> 00:16:18.240 align:start position:0%
exact verbiage of house rule 65
 
00:16:20.710 --> 00:16:20.720 align:start position:0%
that talks specifically about the
 
00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:21.590 align:start position:0%
that talks specifically about the
deadlines

00:16:21.590 --> 00:16:21.600 align:start position:0%
deadlines
 
00:16:24.870 --> 00:16:24.880 align:start position:0%
listed below will be reasonably amended
 
00:16:26.230 --> 00:16:26.240 align:start position:0%
by the speaker
 
00:16:28.949 --> 00:16:28.959 align:start position:0%
with the concurrence of the democratic
 
00:16:30.550 --> 00:16:30.560 align:start position:0%
and republican leaders
 
00:16:33.670 --> 00:16:33.680 align:start position:0%
we are here talking right now about
 
00:16:37.269 --> 00:16:37.279 align:start position:0%
deadlines scheduling and that's exactly
 
00:16:39.030 --> 00:16:39.040 align:start position:0%

discussion

00:16:56.629 --> 00:16:56.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:59.829 --> 00:16:59.839 align:start position:0%
see no further discussion um i will ask
 
00:17:03.350 --> 00:17:03.360 align:start position:0%

00:17:46.070 --> 00:17:46.080 align:start position:0%
uh mr mr clerk just for the record uh is
 
00:17:47.110 --> 00:17:47.120 align:start position:0%
the person
 
00:17:49.590 --> 00:17:49.600 align:start position:0%
presenting the motion not entitled to
 
00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:51.190 align:start position:0%
presenting the motion not entitled to
speak

00:17:51.190 --> 00:17:51.200 align:start position:0%
speak
 
00:17:54.470 --> 00:17:54.480 align:start position:0%
not your vote rather mr chairman um as
 
00:17:56.950 --> 00:17:56.960 align:start position:0%
as is your policy when when a member is
 
00:17:58.230 --> 00:17:58.240 align:start position:0%
presenting something before the
 
00:17:58.240 --> 00:17:59.430 align:start position:0%
presenting something before the
committee

00:17:59.430 --> 00:17:59.440 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:18:02.390 --> 00:18:02.400 align:start position:0%
and they are uh the person presenting
 
00:18:03.590 --> 00:18:03.600 align:start position:0%
they typically do not
 
00:18:06.310 --> 00:18:06.320 align:start position:0%
participate in the vote um if if you'd
 
00:18:07.350 --> 00:18:07.360 align:start position:0%
like to change that
 
00:18:09.510 --> 00:18:09.520 align:start position:0%
we can we can certainly no that's fine i
 
00:18:11.750 --> 00:18:11.760 align:start position:0%
just want to put it on the record why
 
00:18:14.950 --> 00:18:14.960 align:start position:0%
could i represent weber seems to have a
 
00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:17.830 align:start position:0%
could i represent weber seems to have a
question

00:18:17.830 --> 00:18:17.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:20.950 --> 00:18:20.960 align:start position:0%
in our policy committees
 
00:18:24.390 --> 00:18:24.400 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that that has never
 
00:18:28.230 --> 00:18:28.240 align:start position:0%
been the rule um and i don't know of any
 
00:18:30.630 --> 00:18:30.640 align:start position:0%
policy committee that has operated that
 
00:18:30.640 --> 00:18:31.430 align:start position:0%
policy committee that has operated that
way

00:18:31.430 --> 00:18:31.440 align:start position:0%
way
 
00:18:34.710 --> 00:18:34.720 align:start position:0%
it has always been the procedure ever
 
00:18:36.950 --> 00:18:36.960 align:start position:0%
since i started here
 
00:18:40.070 --> 00:18:40.080 align:start position:0%
uh that the committee
 
00:18:43.830 --> 00:18:43.840 align:start position:0%
chair stepped down from presiding
 
00:18:46.950 --> 00:18:46.960 align:start position:0%
when they were presenting a bill and the
 
00:18:49.990 --> 00:18:50.000 align:start position:0%
vice chair or another member presided
 
00:18:53.190 --> 00:18:53.200 align:start position:0%
but no one has ever to my knowledge
 
00:18:56.870 --> 00:18:56.880 align:start position:0%
lost their vote for presenting a bill
 
00:19:00.070 --> 00:19:00.080 align:start position:0%
and i think if we this is representative
 
00:19:02.870 --> 00:19:02.880 align:start position:0%
weber is correct mr speaker uh i think
 
00:19:05.270 --> 00:19:05.280 align:start position:0%
that's a very dangerous precedent so
 
00:19:07.669 --> 00:19:07.679 align:start position:0%
i hope that we will not observe it now
 
00:19:09.270 --> 00:19:09.280 align:start position:0%
and i hope we will not observe it going
 
00:19:10.470 --> 00:19:10.480 align:start position:0%
forward because it's a complete
 
00:19:12.950 --> 00:19:12.960 align:start position:0%
misstatement of what we've been doing
 
00:19:15.270 --> 00:19:15.280 align:start position:0%
the representative weber's is correct mr
 
00:19:16.710 --> 00:19:16.720 align:start position:0%
speaker i i misspoke
 
00:19:19.190 --> 00:19:19.200 align:start position:0%
on that when we spoke yesterday i was
 
00:19:20.470 --> 00:19:20.480 align:start position:0%
under the impression that you
 
00:19:23.270 --> 00:19:23.280 align:start position:0%
uh were stepping aside from the vote but
 
00:19:25.110 --> 00:19:25.120 align:start position:0%
uh um certainly if you
 
00:19:27.909 --> 00:19:27.919 align:start position:0%
uh want to vote then by all means uh i
 
00:19:29.270 --> 00:19:29.280 align:start position:0%
have not stated the
 
00:19:32.950 --> 00:19:32.960 align:start position:0%
uh the vote total yet so um
 
00:19:36.230 --> 00:19:36.240 align:start position:0%
would you i'll pass on this vote
 
00:19:39.270 --> 00:19:39.280 align:start position:0%
mr clerk but any other future votes uh
 
00:19:40.710 --> 00:19:40.720 align:start position:0%
i think i'm introducing one of the
 
00:19:42.789 --> 00:19:42.799 align:start position:0%
motion and i would request a vote on

00:21:04.149 --> 00:21:04.159 align:start position:0%
trying to finish up on business in the
 
00:21:05.669 --> 00:21:05.679 align:start position:0%
new hampshire house
 
00:21:07.590 --> 00:21:07.600 align:start position:0%
as well as the senate by a normal
 
00:21:09.909 --> 00:21:09.919 align:start position:0%
deadline of june 30th
 
00:21:13.510 --> 00:21:13.520 align:start position:0%
because of the pandemic we're trying to
 
00:21:16.390 --> 00:21:16.400 align:start position:0%
reduce meetings as much as we can i'm
 
00:21:17.990 --> 00:21:18.000 align:start position:0%
very proud of the new hampshire house we
 
00:21:20.149 --> 00:21:20.159 align:start position:0%
have had over a dozen committee meetings
 
00:21:20.789 --> 00:21:20.799 align:start position:0%
that have
 
00:21:23.990 --> 00:21:24.000 align:start position:0%
exact over 30 bills but we all know
 
00:21:27.990 --> 00:21:28.000 align:start position:0%
the uh tremendous workload it puts on
 
00:21:29.669 --> 00:21:29.679 align:start position:0%
our outstanding
 
00:21:34.070 --> 00:21:34.080 align:start position:0%
house staff as well as members
 
00:21:35.750 --> 00:21:35.760 align:start position:0%
in an agreement with the senate
 
00:21:37.190 --> 00:21:37.200 align:start position:0%
president to
 
00:21:41.110 --> 00:21:41.120 align:start position:0%
expedite the finishing of our business
 
00:21:43.669 --> 00:21:43.679 align:start position:0%
we are requesting that we not entered
 
00:21:46.149 --> 00:21:46.159 align:start position:0%
any committees a conference
 
00:21:47.830 --> 00:21:47.840 align:start position:0%
because of the pandemic and the
 
00:21:49.669 --> 00:21:49.679 align:start position:0%
emergency orders which we are all
 
00:21:52.310 --> 00:21:52.320 align:start position:0%
operating under in an order for us to
 
00:21:53.110 --> 00:21:53.120 align:start position:0%
finish our
 
00:21:56.630 --> 00:21:56.640 align:start position:0%
session by the june 30th deadline
 
00:21:58.789 --> 00:21:58.799 align:start position:0%
that's the best i can do and if the
 
00:22:00.310 --> 00:22:00.320 align:start position:0%
member has a follow-up i'd be glad to
 
00:22:01.750 --> 00:22:01.760 align:start position:0%
answer it if i can
 
00:22:04.470 --> 00:22:04.480 align:start position:0%
i do have a phone the reason why this
 
00:22:06.070 --> 00:22:06.080 align:start position:0%
virtual stuff like i'll give you an
 
00:22:07.909 --> 00:22:07.919 align:start position:0%
example yesterday
 
00:22:10.789 --> 00:22:10.799 align:start position:0%
we had veterans call in but because they
 
00:22:12.230 --> 00:22:12.240 align:start position:0%
didn't get the calendar
 
00:22:14.710 --> 00:22:14.720 align:start position:0%
and they didn't have the information to
 
00:22:16.310 --> 00:22:16.320 align:start position:0%
uh register
 
00:22:18.390 --> 00:22:18.400 align:start position:0%
they couldn't speak now if they were in
 
00:22:19.350 --> 00:22:19.360 align:start position:0%
a room
 
00:22:21.190 --> 00:22:21.200 align:start position:0%
they could have put the gut up and
 
00:22:23.510 --> 00:22:23.520 align:start position:0%
filled out a card and submitted it
 
00:22:25.510 --> 00:22:25.520 align:start position:0%
so and then i homeless veterans on the
 
00:22:28.470 --> 00:22:28.480 align:start position:0%
phone no way of raising their hand
 
00:22:29.990 --> 00:22:30.000 align:start position:0%
uh then all of a sudden near the end
 
00:22:32.149 --> 00:22:32.159 align:start position:0%
they said press star nine
 
00:22:34.070 --> 00:22:34.080 align:start position:0%
but they already got aggravated and hung
 
00:22:36.630 --> 00:22:36.640 align:start position:0%
up so this virtual thing would
 
00:22:39.590 --> 00:22:39.600 align:start position:0%
we're stepping on the private on the
 
00:22:40.950 --> 00:22:40.960 align:start position:0%
citizens right
 
00:22:44.230 --> 00:22:44.240 align:start position:0%
to speak because not everyone has email
 
00:22:47.350 --> 00:22:47.360 align:start position:0%
nobody sees the calendar and i'm hoping
 
00:22:48.470 --> 00:22:48.480 align:start position:0%
we can get this
 
00:22:50.230 --> 00:22:50.240 align:start position:0%
corrected and that's why i was shocked
 
00:22:52.789 --> 00:22:52.799 align:start position:0%
about the comedic conferences also
 
00:22:55.590 --> 00:22:55.600 align:start position:0%
with the excuse that we're in a pandemic
 
00:22:55.600 --> 00:22:56.310 align:start position:0%
with the excuse that we're in a pandemic
when

00:22:56.310 --> 00:22:56.320 align:start position:0%
when
 
00:22:57.830 --> 00:22:57.840 align:start position:0%
people are meeting all over the place
 
00:22:59.590 --> 00:22:59.600 align:start position:0%
out there meeting on the streets
 
00:23:03.750 --> 00:23:03.760 align:start position:0%
why yes as legislators are scared
 
00:23:08.549 --> 00:23:08.559 align:start position:0%
well i if i may madam chain yes follow
 
00:23:10.390 --> 00:23:10.400 align:start position:0%
i thank the member for his comment i
 
00:23:12.710 --> 00:23:12.720 align:start position:0%

he did in conducting uh that committee
 
00:23:23.110 --> 00:23:23.120 align:start position:0%
hearing yesterday at public hearing it's
 
00:23:25.350 --> 00:23:25.360 align:start position:0%
my understanding over 15 people had an
 
00:23:27.029 --> 00:23:27.039 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak
 
00:23:28.950 --> 00:23:28.960 align:start position:0%
uh in support of the bill that
 
00:23:30.950 --> 00:23:30.960 align:start position:0%
representative baldassaro
 
00:23:34.710 --> 00:23:34.720 align:start position:0%
um introduced that being a late bill
 
00:23:37.830 --> 00:23:37.840 align:start position:0%
but a bill that remember felt had merit
 
00:23:39.990 --> 00:23:40.000 align:start position:0%
and a reason for its lateness
 
00:23:43.430 --> 00:23:43.440 align:start position:0%
um we are operating uh
 
00:23:46.070 --> 00:23:46.080 align:start position:0%
our house staff is operating as is the
 
00:23:48.230 --> 00:23:48.240 align:start position:0%

complaint that i've heard of anybody not
 
00:24:00.950 --> 00:24:00.960 align:start position:0%

in mind the security of the link itself

renovations but at that meeting the

make an amendment to the constitution
 
00:30:43.269 --> 00:30:43.279 align:start position:0%
it should be done with a very
 
00:30:47.269 --> 00:30:47.279 align:start position:0%
very vigorous vetting and
 
00:30:50.149 --> 00:30:50.159 align:start position:0%

rushed through without a good
 
00:31:06.870 --> 00:31:06.880 align:start position:0%
thorough public hearing the constitution
 
00:31:09.990 --> 00:31:10.000 align:start position:0%
is one of the most if not the most uh
 
00:31:12.070 --> 00:31:12.080 align:start position:0%
critical documents that we have in front
 
00:31:15.029 --> 00:31:15.039 align:start position:0%

00:31:18.230 --> 00:31:18.240 align:start position:0%
just to make it to the november ballot

if we do nothing and the trigger is
 
00:35:08.710 --> 00:35:08.720 align:start position:0%
activated the bet
 
00:35:11.829 --> 00:35:11.839 align:start position:0%

00:35:22.790 --> 00:35:22.800 align:start position:0%
it is critical that we alleviate this
 
00:35:24.310 --> 00:35:24.320 align:start position:0%
future burden
 
00:35:26.470 --> 00:35:26.480 align:start position:0%
now i've read the news and i've heard it
 
00:35:27.990 --> 00:35:28.000 align:start position:0%
direct from the speaker
 
00:35:29.990 --> 00:35:30.000 align:start position:0%
and the majority leader that they
 
00:35:31.910 --> 00:35:31.920 align:start position:0%
believe this is not urgent
 
00:35:35.589 --> 00:35:35.599 align:start position:0%
and can wait until 2021. my message
 
00:35:38.710 --> 00:35:38.720 align:start position:0%
is that we cannot wait our businesses
 
00:35:39.990 --> 00:35:40.000 align:start position:0%
cannot wait
 
00:35:42.550 --> 00:35:42.560 align:start position:0%
the rate uh is scheduled to change on
 
00:35:43.990 --> 00:35:44.000 align:start position:0%
january 1st
 
00:35:45.910 --> 00:35:45.920 align:start position:0%
well before legislation could be
 
00:35:47.910 --> 00:35:47.920 align:start position:0%
fast-tracked through the house and
 
00:35:47.920 --> 00:35:48.790 align:start position:0%
fast-tracked through the house and
senate

00:35:48.790 --> 00:35:48.800 align:start position:0%
senate
 
00:35:51.670 --> 00:35:51.680 align:start position:0%
businesses are making decisions now and
 
00:35:53.829 --> 00:35:53.839 align:start position:0%
will be through the rest of the year
 
00:35:55.990 --> 00:35:56.000 align:start position:0%
based on the prospect of that rate
 
00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:56.870 align:start position:0%
based on the prospect of that rate
change

00:35:56.870 --> 00:35:56.880 align:start position:0%
change
 
00:35:59.589 --> 00:35:59.599 align:start position:0%
this affects their hiring decisions this
 
00:35:59.599 --> 00:36:00.310 align:start position:0%
this affects their hiring decisions this
year

00:36:00.310 --> 00:36:00.320 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:36:02.790 --> 00:36:02.800 align:start position:0%
this affects their ability to purchase
 
00:36:04.310 --> 00:36:04.320 align:start position:0%
capital equipment
 
00:36:08.470 --> 00:36:08.480 align:start position:0%
this year etc to ask businesses to wait
 
00:36:11.910 --> 00:36:11.920 align:start position:0%
and see quote unquote if the legislature
 
00:36:13.109 --> 00:36:13.119 align:start position:0%
does something
 
00:36:15.829 --> 00:36:15.839 align:start position:0%
in six months does not seem to make
 
00:36:15.839 --> 00:36:16.710 align:start position:0%
in six months does not seem to make
sense

00:36:16.710 --> 00:36:16.720 align:start position:0%
sense
 
00:36:19.589 --> 00:36:19.599 align:start position:0%
the january rate tax rate is already
 
00:36:22.230 --> 00:36:22.240 align:start position:0%
affecting the decision-making now
 
00:36:25.270 --> 00:36:25.280 align:start position:0%
not allowing this simple modification to
 
00:36:27.030 --> 00:36:27.040 align:start position:0%
have an up or down vote
 
00:36:29.510 --> 00:36:29.520 align:start position:0%
by the house is the same thing as as
 
00:36:31.270 --> 00:36:31.280 align:start position:0%
saying you are okay
 
00:36:34.390 --> 00:36:34.400 align:start position:0%
with increased taxes on our struggling
 
00:36:36.870 --> 00:36:36.880 align:start position:0%
small businesses during a global
 
00:36:36.880 --> 00:36:37.990 align:start position:0%
small businesses during a global
pandemic

00:36:37.990 --> 00:36:38.000 align:start position:0%
pandemic
 
00:36:41.109 --> 00:36:41.119 align:start position:0%
and economic recovery this is not
 
00:36:43.750 --> 00:36:43.760 align:start position:0%
a dramatic change in policy this would
 
00:36:45.510 --> 00:36:45.520 align:start position:0%
simply keep the rates
 
00:36:48.470 --> 00:36:48.480 align:start position:0%
where they are now into the new year
 
00:36:50.470 --> 00:36:50.480 align:start position:0%
this is not rocket science
 
00:36:52.390 --> 00:36:52.400 align:start position:0%
it's a way to demonstrate that the
 
00:36:54.390 --> 00:36:54.400 align:start position:0%
legislature is focused
 
00:36:57.510 --> 00:36:57.520 align:start position:0%
on jobs and the economy and we want to
 
00:36:57.520 --> 00:36:57.910 align:start position:0%
on jobs and the economy and we want to
help

00:36:57.910 --> 00:36:57.920 align:start position:0%
help
 
00:37:01.030 --> 00:37:01.040 align:start position:0%
our small businesses rise out of this
 
00:37:04.470 --> 00:37:04.480 align:start position:0%
pandemic the time is now to act on this
 
00:37:06.950 --> 00:37:06.960 align:start position:0%
urgent need for our businesses to know
 
00:37:08.069 --> 00:37:08.079 align:start position:0%
their taxes
 
00:37:11.030 --> 00:37:11.040 align:start position:0%
will not go up and they can get our
 
00:37:13.270 --> 00:37:13.280 align:start position:0%
citizens back to work
 
00:37:16.870 --> 00:37:16.880 align:start position:0%

00:38:27.750 --> 00:38:27.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:36.630 --> 00:38:36.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:39.990 --> 00:38:40.000 align:start position:0%
unmute okay can you hear me now yeah
 
00:38:42.069 --> 00:38:42.079 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry about that your record thank
 
00:38:44.950 --> 00:38:44.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:48.390 --> 00:38:48.400 align:start position:0%
when i think about the late drafting
 
00:38:52.310 --> 00:38:52.320 align:start position:0%
i always try to consider whether or not
 
00:38:55.109 --> 00:38:55.119 align:start position:0%
uh the drafting uh pertains to
 
00:38:56.630 --> 00:38:56.640 align:start position:0%
information that is
 
00:39:00.069 --> 00:39:00.079 align:start position:0%
completely new to the situation
 
00:39:02.950 --> 00:39:02.960 align:start position:0%
and actually the triggers have been in
 
00:39:03.589 --> 00:39:03.599 align:start position:0%
the budget
 
00:39:06.230 --> 00:39:06.240 align:start position:0%
since we passed it in september so we
 
00:39:06.870 --> 00:39:06.880 align:start position:0%
were all
 
00:39:10.390 --> 00:39:10.400 align:start position:0%
we've all been aware of the um
 
00:39:12.230 --> 00:39:12.240 align:start position:0%
the triggers that were in the budget and
 
00:39:13.990 --> 00:39:14.000 align:start position:0%
how those triggers work
 
00:39:17.510 --> 00:39:17.520 align:start position:0%
we're now in june so we've had a lot of
 
00:39:18.950 --> 00:39:18.960 align:start position:0%
time to think about them
 
00:39:21.750 --> 00:39:21.760 align:start position:0%
and to have uh brought forth in the
 
00:39:21.760 --> 00:39:22.790 align:start position:0%
and to have uh brought forth in the
regular

00:39:22.790 --> 00:39:22.800 align:start position:0%
regular
 
00:39:25.349 --> 00:39:25.359 align:start position:0%
um session we could have brought forth
 
00:39:27.190 --> 00:39:27.200 align:start position:0%
legislation to change those
 
00:39:30.230 --> 00:39:30.240 align:start position:0%
those triggers so um for me
 
00:39:33.750 --> 00:39:33.760 align:start position:0%
it does not feel like um this is the
 
00:39:33.760 --> 00:39:34.230 align:start position:0%
it does not feel like um this is the
time

00:39:34.230 --> 00:39:34.240 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:39:37.270 --> 00:39:37.280 align:start position:0%
for us to be changing um
 
00:39:39.510 --> 00:39:39.520 align:start position:0%
what we voted on in the budget in
 
00:39:39.520 --> 00:39:40.870 align:start position:0%
what we voted on in the budget in
september

00:39:40.870 --> 00:39:40.880 align:start position:0%
september
 
00:39:43.990 --> 00:39:44.000 align:start position:0%
and um as
 
00:39:47.190 --> 00:39:47.200 align:start position:0%
all of you know the governor has
 
00:39:50.870 --> 00:39:50.880 align:start position:0%
um allowed businesses to pay taxes
 
00:39:53.430 --> 00:39:53.440 align:start position:0%
that were due in april they will be in
 
00:39:55.430 --> 00:39:55.440 align:start position:0%
um the date has been
 
00:39:58.470 --> 00:39:58.480 align:start position:0%
pushed up to june 15th which was a
 
00:40:01.270 --> 00:40:01.280 align:start position:0%
i think a good a good good choice to
 
00:40:03.589 --> 00:40:03.599 align:start position:0%
push that data
 
00:40:06.150 --> 00:40:06.160 align:start position:0%
but at this point we don't really have
 
00:40:08.069 --> 00:40:08.079 align:start position:0%
the kind of information we need
 
00:40:10.870 --> 00:40:10.880 align:start position:0%
to make this kind of a decision so uh
 
00:40:12.309 --> 00:40:12.319 align:start position:0%
for me i'll be voting no
 
00:40:15.829 --> 00:40:15.839 align:start position:0%
on the motion um for uh late drafting
 
00:40:17.829 --> 00:40:17.839 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker representative
 
00:40:19.190 --> 00:40:19.200 align:start position:0%
hinch had his hand up and then
 
00:40:21.270 --> 00:40:21.280 align:start position:0%
representative hosel
 
00:40:23.829 --> 00:40:23.839 align:start position:0%
representative hinch is recognized thank
 
00:40:25.510 --> 00:40:25.520 align:start position:0%
you mr speaker i would just like to
 
00:40:27.829 --> 00:40:27.839 align:start position:0%
remind everybody that is participating
 
00:40:28.870 --> 00:40:28.880 align:start position:0%
here today
 
00:40:32.069 --> 00:40:32.079 align:start position:0%
that the pandemic occurred during
 
00:40:35.349 --> 00:40:35.359 align:start position:0%
uh the month of march and this is urgent
 
00:40:37.670 --> 00:40:37.680 align:start position:0%
and compelling at this time was
 
00:40:39.270 --> 00:40:39.280 align:start position:0%
unforeseen at the time
 
00:40:41.270 --> 00:40:41.280 align:start position:0%
that the budget was negotiated and
 
00:40:43.430 --> 00:40:43.440 align:start position:0%
passed and put into law
 
00:40:47.109 --> 00:40:47.119 align:start position:0%
so this is this is something to address
 
00:40:50.309 --> 00:40:50.319 align:start position:0%
the pandemic and to help the businesses
 
00:40:51.910 --> 00:40:51.920 align:start position:0%
that are suffering and going out of
 
00:40:54.230 --> 00:40:54.240 align:start position:0%
business this is not something
 
00:40:56.390 --> 00:40:56.400 align:start position:0%
that could have been foreseen back in
 
00:40:56.400 --> 00:40:57.829 align:start position:0%
that could have been foreseen back in
december

00:40:57.829 --> 00:40:57.839 align:start position:0%
december
 
00:41:00.309 --> 00:41:00.319 align:start position:0%
or earlier when we did the budget thank
 
00:41:00.319 --> 00:41:01.829 align:start position:0%
or earlier when we did the budget thank
you

00:41:01.829 --> 00:41:01.839 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:41:06.710 --> 00:41:06.720 align:start position:0%
representative holzel is recognized
 
00:41:10.150 --> 00:41:10.160 align:start position:0%
thank you uh i guess i would
 
00:41:13.750 --> 00:41:13.760 align:start position:0%
repeat exactly what representative hinch
 
00:41:17.750 --> 00:41:17.760 align:start position:0%
just said but also i'm from a community
 
00:41:21.990 --> 00:41:22.000 align:start position:0%
that the business all of the businesses
 
00:41:25.109 --> 00:41:25.119 align:start position:0%
are struggling at this point and
 
00:41:28.230 --> 00:41:28.240 align:start position:0%
i've heard from many of them
 
00:41:34.069 --> 00:41:34.079 align:start position:0%
i cannot vote uh in favor of this
 
00:41:37.030 --> 00:41:37.040 align:start position:0%
thank you uh any other questions
 
00:41:39.109 --> 00:41:39.119 align:start position:0%
representative lay mr speaker
 
00:41:41.349 --> 00:41:41.359 align:start position:0%
representative lay is recognized i think
 
00:41:42.710 --> 00:41:42.720 align:start position:0%
representative weber had her hand up
 
00:41:43.670 --> 00:41:43.680 align:start position:0%
before him
 
00:41:45.349 --> 00:41:45.359 align:start position:0%
uh actually you did because you went to
 
00:41:47.510 --> 00:41:47.520 align:start position:0%
the top of the list
 
00:41:47.520 --> 00:41:51.109 align:start position:0%
the top of the list
okay

00:41:51.109 --> 00:41:51.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:53.270 --> 00:41:53.280 align:start position:0%
well thank you mr speaker um i would
 
00:41:55.190 --> 00:41:55.200 align:start position:0%
just point out that um
 
00:41:58.309 --> 00:41:58.319 align:start position:0%
while the pandemic began in march um
 
00:41:59.910 --> 00:41:59.920 align:start position:0%
this trigger was put in place in
 
00:42:01.750 --> 00:42:01.760 align:start position:0%
september and it was certainly
 
00:42:03.670 --> 00:42:03.680 align:start position:0%
understood by everybody including the
 
00:42:06.470 --> 00:42:06.480 align:start position:0%
governor who proposed the trigger
 
00:42:08.150 --> 00:42:08.160 align:start position:0%
it was certainly understood that the
 
00:42:09.910 --> 00:42:09.920 align:start position:0%
only way this trigger would come into
 
00:42:10.950 --> 00:42:10.960 align:start position:0%
effect would be
 
00:42:14.790 --> 00:42:14.800 align:start position:0%
in a serious circumstances
 
00:42:16.630 --> 00:42:16.640 align:start position:0%
those circumstances have arisen so
 
00:42:19.190 --> 00:42:19.200 align:start position:0%
therefore there is nothing new here
 
00:42:22.390 --> 00:42:22.400 align:start position:0%
um except that it has
 
00:42:25.589 --> 00:42:25.599 align:start position:0%
actually has come to pass so
 
00:42:27.990 --> 00:42:28.000 align:start position:0%
i don't see anything new that is
 
00:42:29.589 --> 00:42:29.599 align:start position:0%
developed here
 
00:42:32.230 --> 00:42:32.240 align:start position:0%
more to the point in what i did state
 
00:42:34.950 --> 00:42:34.960 align:start position:0%
the other day
 
00:42:36.790 --> 00:42:36.800 align:start position:0%
right now we do not know what the
 
00:42:38.630 --> 00:42:38.640 align:start position:0%
state's revenues will be
 
00:42:41.510 --> 00:42:41.520 align:start position:0%
for the fiscal year we also don't know
 
00:42:43.430 --> 00:42:43.440 align:start position:0%
what the business tax revenues will be
 
00:42:44.710 --> 00:42:44.720 align:start position:0%
for the fiscal year
 
00:42:48.150 --> 00:42:48.160 align:start position:0%
and this will be determined as stated in
 
00:42:49.910 --> 00:42:49.920 align:start position:0%
the budget agreement
 
00:42:53.589 --> 00:42:53.599 align:start position:0%
ultimately by the kafir which comes out
 
00:42:57.030 --> 00:42:57.040 align:start position:0%
in december of 2020
 
00:42:58.790 --> 00:42:58.800 align:start position:0%
at that point we would have much more
 
00:43:00.470 --> 00:43:00.480 align:start position:0%
information in terms of
 
00:43:03.510 --> 00:43:03.520 align:start position:0%
the overall status of state
 
00:43:06.069 --> 00:43:06.079 align:start position:0%
budgetary revenues and we would also
 
00:43:07.990 --> 00:43:08.000 align:start position:0%
have much more information
 
00:43:11.430 --> 00:43:11.440 align:start position:0%
obviously upon the state of business tax
 
00:43:13.910 --> 00:43:13.920 align:start position:0%
revenues and i think that on something
 
00:43:15.270 --> 00:43:15.280 align:start position:0%
such as this
 
00:43:17.349 --> 00:43:17.359 align:start position:0%
because it'll have a major impact on the
 
00:43:19.190 --> 00:43:19.200 align:start position:0%
second year second fiscal year of the
 
00:43:20.710 --> 00:43:20.720 align:start position:0%
biennium and also
 
00:43:23.349 --> 00:43:23.359 align:start position:0%
on future budgets and future bienniums
 
00:43:24.870 --> 00:43:24.880 align:start position:0%
that it simply makes sense
 
00:43:28.630 --> 00:43:28.640 align:start position:0%
to wait until we have the full
 
00:43:31.829 --> 00:43:31.839 align:start position:0%
information at hand right now we do not
 
00:43:33.430 --> 00:43:33.440 align:start position:0%
have it
 
00:43:36.790 --> 00:43:36.800 align:start position:0%
and so to make fiscal policy
 
00:43:39.829 --> 00:43:39.839 align:start position:0%
without adequate fiscal and financial
 
00:43:43.349 --> 00:43:43.359 align:start position:0%
information is akin to planning on the
 
00:43:44.470 --> 00:43:44.480 align:start position:0%
back of a napkin
 
00:43:46.630 --> 00:43:46.640 align:start position:0%
and we should not be engaging in that
 
00:43:47.670 --> 00:43:47.680 align:start position:0%
sort of planning
 
00:43:51.910 --> 00:43:51.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:55.030 --> 00:43:55.040 align:start position:0%
i must vote against the proposal
 
00:43:56.790 --> 00:43:56.800 align:start position:0%
offered by my friend representative
 
00:43:58.550 --> 00:43:58.560 align:start position:0%
hinch thank you
 
00:44:00.390 --> 00:44:00.400 align:start position:0%
thank you representative weber mr
 
00:44:01.750 --> 00:44:01.760 align:start position:0%
speaker representative webb is
 
00:44:01.760 --> 00:44:02.950 align:start position:0%
speaker representative webb is
recognized

00:44:02.950 --> 00:44:02.960 align:start position:0%
recognized
 
00:44:07.270 --> 00:44:07.280 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker i
 
00:44:09.270 --> 00:44:09.280 align:start position:0%
much of what i was going to say has
 
00:44:11.030 --> 00:44:11.040 align:start position:0%
already been stated
 
00:44:13.510 --> 00:44:13.520 align:start position:0%
by representative lay so i won't restate
 
00:44:15.349 --> 00:44:15.359 align:start position:0%
it except to say that although we did
 
00:44:15.359 --> 00:44:15.990 align:start position:0%
it except to say that although we did
not

00:44:15.990 --> 00:44:16.000 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:44:20.150 --> 00:44:20.160 align:start position:0%
anticipate a pandemic this particular
 
00:44:23.190 --> 00:44:23.200 align:start position:0%
catastrophe we certainly did
 
00:44:25.190 --> 00:44:25.200 align:start position:0%
and have for years when we've been
 
00:44:26.950 --> 00:44:26.960 align:start position:0%
discussing triggers
 
00:44:29.190 --> 00:44:29.200 align:start position:0%
recognized that one of the things that
 
00:44:29.990 --> 00:44:30.000 align:start position:0%
might happen
 
00:44:33.190 --> 00:44:33.200 align:start position:0%
is a significant economic disruption
 
00:44:35.510 --> 00:44:35.520 align:start position:0%
and that's what we're looking at now i
 
00:44:36.790 --> 00:44:36.800 align:start position:0%
also want to make it
 
00:44:41.109 --> 00:44:41.119 align:start position:0%
clear from my perspective that
 
00:44:43.670 --> 00:44:43.680 align:start position:0%
i absolutely agree that we have many
 
00:44:45.829 --> 00:44:45.839 align:start position:0%
many businesses that are in terrible
 
00:44:48.150 --> 00:44:48.160 align:start position:0%
dire straits
 
00:44:52.630 --> 00:44:52.640 align:start position:0%
but i think it very unlikely that for
 
00:44:55.190 --> 00:44:55.200 align:start position:0%
those businesses in dire straits that
 
00:44:56.870 --> 00:44:56.880 align:start position:0%
the change in the business
 
00:45:00.870 --> 00:45:00.880 align:start position:0%
tax rates that we are talking about here
 
00:45:02.790 --> 00:45:02.800 align:start position:0%
is going to make a material difference
 
00:45:04.390 --> 00:45:04.400 align:start position:0%
to whether they stay open
 
00:45:07.349 --> 00:45:07.359 align:start position:0%
or not because there are so many other
 
00:45:07.359 --> 00:45:08.470 align:start position:0%
or not because there are so many other
stressors

00:45:08.470 --> 00:45:08.480 align:start position:0%
stressors
 
00:45:11.270 --> 00:45:11.280 align:start position:0%
that are so much more dire for those
 
00:45:11.280 --> 00:45:12.630 align:start position:0%
that are so much more dire for those
businesses

00:45:12.630 --> 00:45:12.640 align:start position:0%
businesses
 
00:45:15.670 --> 00:45:15.680 align:start position:0%
and i also want to remind all of us that
 
00:45:16.150 --> 00:45:16.160 align:start position:0%
there are
 
00:45:22.550 --> 00:45:22.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:25.190 --> 00:45:25.200 align:start position:0%
do i need to stop sir uh just just for a
 
00:45:26.950 --> 00:45:26.960 align:start position:0%
moment i'm not sure why the recording
 
00:45:31.430 --> 00:45:31.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:37.510 --> 00:45:37.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:40.950 --> 00:45:40.960 align:start position:0%
okay good uh my last point was just that
 
00:45:41.670 --> 00:45:41.680 align:start position:0%
we have
 
00:45:44.870 --> 00:45:44.880 align:start position:0%
many large out-of-state corporations who
 
00:45:47.109 --> 00:45:47.119 align:start position:0%
as a result of this pandemic are doing
 
00:45:48.630 --> 00:45:48.640 align:start position:0%
far better than they have ever done
 
00:45:50.230 --> 00:45:50.240 align:start position:0%
before and
 
00:45:53.270 --> 00:45:53.280 align:start position:0%
as representative lay said it is
 
00:45:56.309 --> 00:45:56.319 align:start position:0%
important for us to understand
 
00:46:00.550 --> 00:46:00.560 align:start position:0%
exactly who is benefiting and who is
 
00:46:03.910 --> 00:46:03.920 align:start position:0%
who is going to actually be affected in
 
00:46:06.150 --> 00:46:06.160 align:start position:0%
their business plans by the rate change
 
00:46:08.150 --> 00:46:08.160 align:start position:0%
so i thank you very much for the
 
00:46:10.470 --> 00:46:10.480 align:start position:0%
opportunity to comment
 
00:46:12.309 --> 00:46:12.319 align:start position:0%
mr speaker representative holzel has her
 
00:46:13.589 --> 00:46:13.599 align:start position:0%

exactly what the
 
00:46:30.710 --> 00:46:30.720 align:start position:0%
motion would be but i am
 
00:46:33.990 --> 00:46:34.000 align:start position:0%
fully in favor of this motion
 
00:46:36.550 --> 00:46:36.560 align:start position:0%
and i think it will help the little
 
00:46:36.560 --> 00:46:37.670 align:start position:0%
and i think it will help the little
business

00:46:37.670 --> 00:46:37.680 align:start position:0%
business
 
00:46:40.870 --> 00:46:40.880 align:start position:0%

any other questions or comments
 
00:46:48.710 --> 00:46:48.720 align:start position:0%
mr speaker representative hinch had his
 
00:46:50.630 --> 00:46:50.640 align:start position:0%
hand up and then representative butler
 
00:46:52.950 --> 00:46:52.960 align:start position:0%
and i would just make a quick mention mr
 
00:46:55.270 --> 00:46:55.280 align:start position:0%
speaker one of the members accidentally
 
00:46:58.550 --> 00:46:58.560 align:start position:0%
hit um on their computer or tablet the
 
00:47:00.790 --> 00:47:00.800 align:start position:0%
um pause recording button and that's uh
 
00:47:02.309 --> 00:47:02.319 align:start position:0%
what caused the interruption so
 
00:47:08.550 --> 00:47:08.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:11.910 --> 00:47:11.920 align:start position:0%
no comment um
 
00:47:15.030 --> 00:47:15.040 align:start position:0%
representative uh i'm sorry mr clerk uh
 
00:47:16.390 --> 00:47:16.400 align:start position:0%
i know representative butler
 
00:47:18.230 --> 00:47:18.240 align:start position:0%
you mentioned it was before
 
00:47:20.390 --> 00:47:20.400 align:start position:0%
representative hinch uh
 
00:47:21.510 --> 00:47:21.520 align:start position:0%
representative that's what i thought
 
00:47:23.829 --> 00:47:23.839 align:start position:0%
representative hinch was
 
00:47:25.990 --> 00:47:26.000 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you mr speaker and not i'm mo
 
00:47:27.589 --> 00:47:27.599 align:start position:0%
prolong this because i know where the
 
00:47:28.950 --> 00:47:28.960 align:start position:0%
vote's going to go
 
00:47:31.670 --> 00:47:31.680 align:start position:0%
but in um conclusion i would just like
 
00:47:32.630 --> 00:47:32.640 align:start position:0%
to point out
 
00:47:35.670 --> 00:47:35.680 align:start position:0%
that this proposal is absolutely not
 
00:47:36.630 --> 00:47:36.640 align:start position:0%
being done
 
00:47:39.589 --> 00:47:39.599 align:start position:0%
on the back of a napkin but failure to
 
00:47:40.549 --> 00:47:40.559 align:start position:0%
act on this
 
00:47:43.030 --> 00:47:43.040 align:start position:0%
will be on the backs of the businesses
 
00:47:45.190 --> 00:47:45.200 align:start position:0%
that will definitely go out of business
 
00:47:47.910 --> 00:47:47.920 align:start position:0%
from our lack of action on this so thank
 
00:47:47.920 --> 00:47:48.790 align:start position:0%
from our lack of action on this so thank
you

00:47:48.790 --> 00:47:48.800 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:47:51.270 --> 00:47:51.280 align:start position:0%
thank you representative butler is
 
00:47:51.280 --> 00:47:54.790 align:start position:0%
thank you representative butler is
recognized

00:47:54.790 --> 00:47:54.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:57.990 --> 00:47:58.000 align:start position:0%
a small business owner i just want to
 
00:48:01.270 --> 00:48:01.280 align:start position:0%
reinforce uh what uh especially
 
00:48:04.309 --> 00:48:04.319 align:start position:0%
representative weber said um the impact
 
00:48:08.630 --> 00:48:08.640 align:start position:0%
of this tax
 
00:48:12.230 --> 00:48:12.240 align:start position:0%
will be minimal if felt at all
 
00:48:14.230 --> 00:48:14.240 align:start position:0%
by my business and many other small
 
00:48:14.240 --> 00:48:15.270 align:start position:0%
by my business and many other small
businesses

00:48:15.270 --> 00:48:15.280 align:start position:0%
businesses
 
00:48:17.349 --> 00:48:17.359 align:start position:0%
and having all of the information
 
00:48:17.359 --> 00:48:19.190 align:start position:0%
and having all of the information
necessary

00:48:19.190 --> 00:48:19.200 align:start position:0%
necessary
 
00:48:21.829 --> 00:48:21.839 align:start position:0%
to understand the impact i think is
 
00:48:23.349 --> 00:48:23.359 align:start position:0%
critically important
 
00:48:25.990 --> 00:48:26.000 align:start position:0%
and so therefore i will not be
 
00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:26.630 align:start position:0%
and so therefore i will not be
supporting

00:48:26.630 --> 00:48:26.640 align:start position:0%
supporting
 
00:48:29.670 --> 00:48:29.680 align:start position:0%

of hudson and pelham
 
00:52:56.309 --> 00:52:56.319 align:start position:0%
back in march i coordinated the issuance
 
00:52:58.069 --> 00:52:58.079 align:start position:0%
of a press release by a bipartisan group
 
00:52:59.430 --> 00:52:59.440 align:start position:0%
of legislators calling on the governor
 
00:53:01.190 --> 00:53:01.200 align:start position:0%
to temporary allow bars and restaurants
 
00:53:03.030 --> 00:53:03.040 align:start position:0%
to be allowed to fill growlers
 
00:53:05.430 --> 00:53:05.440 align:start position:0%
during the state of emergency growlers
 
00:53:07.190 --> 00:53:07.200 align:start position:0%
are a refillable beer container
 
00:53:08.790 --> 00:53:08.800 align:start position:0%
usually made of glass and are very
 
00:53:11.349 --> 00:53:11.359 align:start position:0%
common in the craft brewing industry
 
00:53:12.950 --> 00:53:12.960 align:start position:0%
they are refilled from beer tabs very
 
00:53:14.549 --> 00:53:14.559 align:start position:0%
similar to pouring a pint for immediate
 
00:53:14.559 --> 00:53:15.589 align:start position:0%
similar to pouring a pint for immediate
consumption

00:53:15.589 --> 00:53:15.599 align:start position:0%
consumption
 
00:53:18.549 --> 00:53:18.559 align:start position:0%
but are then sealed and transported the
 
00:53:19.829 --> 00:53:19.839 align:start position:0%
filling of growlers
 
00:53:21.430 --> 00:53:21.440 align:start position:0%
breweries has continued unaffected
 
00:53:23.349 --> 00:53:23.359 align:start position:0%
throughout the shutdown
 
00:53:25.670 --> 00:53:25.680 align:start position:0%
this request was made in the hopes that
 
00:53:28.309 --> 00:53:28.319 align:start position:0%
to solve a looming problem
 
00:53:30.790 --> 00:53:30.800 align:start position:0%
draft beer in kegs has a very short
 
00:53:31.829 --> 00:53:31.839 align:start position:0%
shelf life
 
00:53:33.750 --> 00:53:33.760 align:start position:0%
unlike bottle or canned beer domestic
 
00:53:36.470 --> 00:53:36.480 align:start position:0%
cake beer is mostly unpasteurized
 
00:53:39.190 --> 00:53:39.200 align:start position:0%
the problem identified back in march is
 
00:53:41.030 --> 00:53:41.040 align:start position:0%
that if the restaurant shutdown lasted
 
00:53:41.990 --> 00:53:42.000 align:start position:0%
any significant period
 
00:53:43.990 --> 00:53:44.000 align:start position:0%
of time the beer and kegs already in
 
00:53:46.870 --> 00:53:46.880 align:start position:0%
restaurant inventory would spoil
 
00:53:48.390 --> 00:53:48.400 align:start position:0%
in this press release i promised to do
 
00:53:49.510 --> 00:53:49.520 align:start position:0%
whatever i could to prevent this
 
00:53:50.950 --> 00:53:50.960 align:start position:0%
including late introduction into the
 
00:53:51.990 --> 00:53:52.000 align:start position:0%
current term
 
00:53:55.190 --> 00:53:55.200 align:start position:0%
and so here we are unfortunately it's
 
00:53:56.390 --> 00:53:56.400 align:start position:0%
been a while since march
 
00:53:57.910 --> 00:53:57.920 align:start position:0%
the beer in inventory back then has
 
00:53:59.510 --> 00:53:59.520 align:start position:0%
spoiled by now
 
00:54:01.430 --> 00:54:01.440 align:start position:0%
i've heard from one restaurant owner of
 
00:54:02.950 --> 00:54:02.960 align:start position:0%
a five-figure losses from
 
00:54:05.109 --> 00:54:05.119 align:start position:0%
spoiled beer and that's even before
 
00:54:06.710 --> 00:54:06.720 align:start position:0%
disposal fees
 
00:54:08.630 --> 00:54:08.640 align:start position:0%
spoiled beer cannot simply pour down the
 
00:54:10.470 --> 00:54:10.480 align:start position:0%
drain in such volumes without
 
00:54:12.470 --> 00:54:12.480 align:start position:0%
negatively affecting septic systems or
 
00:54:14.069 --> 00:54:14.079 align:start position:0%
sewage treatment plants
 
00:54:15.910 --> 00:54:15.920 align:start position:0%
so the disposal itself has become a
 
00:54:18.390 --> 00:54:18.400 align:start position:0%
challenge as well
 
00:54:20.230 --> 00:54:20.240 align:start position:0%
however i still want to file the bill
 
00:54:21.910 --> 00:54:21.920 align:start position:0%
while i sincerely hope it does not
 
00:54:23.589 --> 00:54:23.599 align:start position:0%
happen many experts are concerned about
 
00:54:25.270 --> 00:54:25.280 align:start position:0%
a seasonal resurgence of
 
00:54:28.069 --> 00:54:28.079 align:start position:0%
the kovic 19 virus in the fall if that
 
00:54:29.670 --> 00:54:29.680 align:start position:0%
happens i want allowances to be in place
 
00:54:31.109 --> 00:54:31.119 align:start position:0%
for restaurants to be allowed to sell
 
00:54:32.630 --> 00:54:32.640 align:start position:0%
their existing inventory
 
00:54:34.790 --> 00:54:34.800 align:start position:0%
of keg beer if there's a new shutdown
 
00:54:38.069 --> 00:54:38.079 align:start position:0%
order or on in-person dining the
 
00:54:39.510 --> 00:54:39.520 align:start position:0%
language i envisioned for this bill
 
00:54:41.270 --> 00:54:41.280 align:start position:0%
would do two things
 
00:54:43.109 --> 00:54:43.119 align:start position:0%
permit filling of growers with labels
 
00:54:45.109 --> 00:54:45.119 align:start position:0%
not matching the product within them
 
00:54:46.630 --> 00:54:46.640 align:start position:0%
this is currently prohibited as a
 
00:54:48.470 --> 00:54:48.480 align:start position:0%
misbranding of beer
 
00:54:50.230 --> 00:54:50.240 align:start position:0%
however this is not a major concern in
 
00:54:52.390 --> 00:54:52.400 align:start position:0%
this context the growler owner
 
00:54:54.069 --> 00:54:54.079 align:start position:0%
the caller is owned by the consumer they
 
00:54:55.510 --> 00:54:55.520 align:start position:0%
bring it in and request to be filled
 
00:54:57.750 --> 00:54:57.760 align:start position:0%
with a specific product on the spot
 
00:54:59.510 --> 00:54:59.520 align:start position:0%
the selling of pre-filled growlers is
 
00:55:01.589 --> 00:55:01.599 align:start position:0%
just not done
 
00:55:03.030 --> 00:55:03.040 align:start position:0%
additionally most established students
 
00:55:05.109 --> 00:55:05.119 align:start position:0%
are prepared to fix a temporary label or
 
00:55:05.119 --> 00:55:05.589 align:start position:0%
are prepared to fix a temporary label or
tag

00:55:05.589 --> 00:55:05.599 align:start position:0%
tag
 
00:55:08.390 --> 00:55:08.400 align:start position:0%
on during each fill and the second thing
 
00:55:09.109 --> 00:55:09.119 align:start position:0%
is permit
 
00:55:11.670 --> 00:55:11.680 align:start position:0%
on-premise license holders facing a
 
00:55:13.670 --> 00:55:13.680 align:start position:0%
shutdown or significant drop in volume
 
00:55:15.190 --> 00:55:15.200 align:start position:0%
due to a state of emergency
 
00:55:17.670 --> 00:55:17.680 align:start position:0%
to sell their existing inventory of keg
 
00:55:17.680 --> 00:55:18.230 align:start position:0%
to sell their existing inventory of keg
beer

00:55:18.230 --> 00:55:18.240 align:start position:0%
beer
 
00:55:19.910 --> 00:55:19.920 align:start position:0%
in refillable containers under the same
 
00:55:22.710 --> 00:55:22.720 align:start position:0%
regulations as breweries
 
00:55:24.710 --> 00:55:24.720 align:start position:0%
these two points go hand in hand as most
 
00:55:26.069 --> 00:55:26.079 align:start position:0%
breweries sell
 
00:55:27.829 --> 00:55:27.839 align:start position:0%
separately empty growlers with their
 
00:55:29.990 --> 00:55:30.000 align:start position:0%
brand logo i cannot expect
 
00:55:31.589 --> 00:55:31.599 align:start position:0%
restaurants to do the same just in case
 
00:55:33.430 --> 00:55:33.440 align:start position:0%
of a shutdown
 
00:55:35.190 --> 00:55:35.200 align:start position:0%

trying to find creative ways to dispose
 
00:56:39.109 --> 00:56:39.119 align:start position:0%
of it to turn it in
 
00:56:41.270 --> 00:56:41.280 align:start position:0%
to reprocess it into animal feed or hand
 
00:56:43.270 --> 00:56:43.280 align:start position:0%
sanitizer or do something with it
 
00:56:45.030 --> 00:56:45.040 align:start position:0%
like i said it's actually quite a
 
00:56:46.630 --> 00:56:46.640 align:start position:0%
challenge to dispose of it in that
 
00:56:46.640 --> 00:56:47.349 align:start position:0%

this only be
 
00:57:29.990 --> 00:57:30.000 align:start position:0%
during the period of the uh emergency
 
00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:32.069 align:start position:0%
during the period of the uh emergency
order

00:57:32.069 --> 00:57:32.079 align:start position:0%
order
 
00:57:33.910 --> 00:57:33.920 align:start position:0%
so the language i envisioned uh point
 
00:57:36.230 --> 00:57:36.240 align:start position:0%
one of permitting the
 
00:57:38.950 --> 00:57:38.960 align:start position:0%
growlers to be filled contrary to their
 
00:57:39.990 --> 00:57:40.000 align:start position:0%
the printed logo
 
00:57:42.630 --> 00:57:42.640 align:start position:0%
on them that i had a vision just being a
 
00:57:43.829 --> 00:57:43.839 align:start position:0%
permanent thing because
 
00:57:47.109 --> 00:57:47.119 align:start position:0%
it's uh it hasn't been something that
 
00:57:48.470 --> 00:57:48.480 align:start position:0%
has made a whole lot of sense because as
 
00:57:50.150 --> 00:57:50.160 align:start position:0%
i said the growlers normally owned by
 
00:57:50.950 --> 00:57:50.960 align:start position:0%
the consumer
 
00:57:53.510 --> 00:57:53.520 align:start position:0%
they walk into a brewery currently and
 
00:57:55.270 --> 00:57:55.280 align:start position:0%
requested to be filled with a specific
 
00:57:55.280 --> 00:57:56.150 align:start position:0%
requested to be filled with a specific
product

00:57:56.150 --> 00:57:56.160 align:start position:0%
product
 
00:57:57.589 --> 00:57:57.599 align:start position:0%
the fact that it's prohibited under our
 
00:57:59.990 --> 00:58:00.000 align:start position:0%
current law for as a misbranding
 
00:58:01.670 --> 00:58:01.680 align:start position:0%
to protect consumers a consumer
 
00:58:03.829 --> 00:58:03.839 align:start position:0%
protection accident hasn't made a whole
 
00:58:05.190 --> 00:58:05.200 align:start position:0%
lot of sense to
 
00:58:07.030 --> 00:58:07.040 align:start position:0%
anyone who's looked at that i've spoken
 
00:58:09.589 --> 00:58:09.599 align:start position:0%
to the second point would only be during
 
00:58:11.190 --> 00:58:11.200 align:start position:0%
a state of emergency
 
00:58:13.510 --> 00:58:13.520 align:start position:0%
that either does a complete shutdown or
 
00:58:13.520 --> 00:58:14.390 align:start position:0%
that either does a complete shutdown or
significant

00:58:14.390 --> 00:58:14.400 align:start position:0%
significant
 
00:58:17.430 --> 00:58:17.440 align:start position:0%
reduction in volume to
 
00:58:20.230 --> 00:58:20.240 align:start position:0%
the uh the sale of beer and so that they
 
00:58:21.190 --> 00:58:21.200 align:start position:0%
could sell it in an
 
00:58:24.390 --> 00:58:24.400 align:start position:0%
alternative manner in growlers
 
00:58:26.390 --> 00:58:26.400 align:start position:0%
in representative butler did you have a
 
00:58:28.069 --> 00:58:28.079 align:start position:0%
follow-up question
 
00:58:31.589 --> 00:58:31.599 align:start position:0%
i do thank you um relative to the
 
00:58:32.950 --> 00:58:32.960 align:start position:0%
labeling issue
 
00:58:37.349 --> 00:58:37.359 align:start position:0%
um as you know the commerce committees
 
00:58:40.950 --> 00:58:40.960 align:start position:0%
at least in the house deal with the
 
00:58:44.630 --> 00:58:44.640 align:start position:0%
issue of our alcohol bills and
 
00:58:48.069 --> 00:58:48.079 align:start position:0%
statutes and we have looked at and dealt
 
00:58:49.030 --> 00:58:49.040 align:start position:0%
with growler
 
00:58:52.549 --> 00:58:52.559 align:start position:0%
issues over the past few years
 
00:58:55.349 --> 00:58:55.359 align:start position:0%
and the house indeed has supported the
 
00:58:55.359 --> 00:58:55.990 align:start position:0%
and the house indeed has supported the
use

00:58:55.990 --> 00:58:56.000 align:start position:0%
use
 
00:58:59.349 --> 00:58:59.359 align:start position:0%
of growlers and extension of growlers
 
00:59:02.390 --> 00:59:02.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:04.789 --> 00:59:04.799 align:start position:0%
will be consistent with how the liquor
 
00:59:04.799 --> 00:59:05.670 align:start position:0%
will be consistent with how the liquor
commission

00:59:05.670 --> 00:59:05.680 align:start position:0%
commission
 
00:59:09.430 --> 00:59:09.440 align:start position:0%
um is uh willing and able to support it
 
00:59:11.270 --> 00:59:11.280 align:start position:0%
so i'm concerned about the labeling
 
00:59:12.470 --> 00:59:12.480 align:start position:0%
issue um
 
00:59:15.910 --> 00:59:15.920 align:start position:0%
and uh i would want to see that
 
00:59:19.750 --> 00:59:19.760 align:start position:0%
uh come before the legislative body
 
00:59:21.910 --> 00:59:21.920 align:start position:0%
and to determine how to deal with that
 
00:59:23.109 --> 00:59:23.119 align:start position:0%
rather than
 
00:59:26.390 --> 00:59:26.400 align:start position:0%
uh make a decision relative uh to that
 
00:59:26.400 --> 00:59:27.349 align:start position:0%
uh make a decision relative uh to that
piece

00:59:27.349 --> 00:59:27.359 align:start position:0%
piece
 
00:59:30.549 --> 00:59:30.559 align:start position:0%
um with a late drafting
 
00:59:33.349 --> 00:59:33.359 align:start position:0%
bill that hasn't had a chance to really
 
00:59:35.030 --> 00:59:35.040 align:start position:0%
be vetted
 
00:59:37.750 --> 00:59:37.760 align:start position:0%
so that concerns me the rest of the bill
 
00:59:42.309 --> 00:59:42.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:44.829 --> 00:59:44.839 align:start position:0%
representative prout did you wish to
 
00:59:44.839 --> 00:59:46.470 align:start position:0%
representative prout did you wish to
comment

00:59:46.470 --> 00:59:46.480 align:start position:0%
comment
 
00:59:49.829 --> 00:59:49.839 align:start position:0%
certainly uh i mean i was trying to be
 
00:59:51.990 --> 00:59:52.000 align:start position:0%
the most expedient if it uh
 
00:59:53.910 --> 00:59:53.920 align:start position:0%
would uh make the committee more
 
00:59:55.510 --> 00:59:55.520 align:start position:0%
favorable to build i certainly could add
 
00:59:57.270 --> 00:59:57.280 align:start position:0%
attach the state of emergency language
 
00:59:59.109 --> 00:59:59.119 align:start position:0%
to that aspect of the
 
01:00:01.190 --> 01:00:01.200 align:start position:0%
point number one of what i was proposing
 
01:00:03.109 --> 01:00:03.119 align:start position:0%
as well
 
01:00:04.950 --> 01:00:04.960 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representatives for
 
01:00:07.349 --> 01:00:07.359 align:start position:0%
other questions and representatives
 
01:00:09.190 --> 01:00:09.200 align:start position:0%
and representative have their hands on
 
01:00:10.630 --> 01:00:10.640 align:start position:0%
mr speaker
 
01:00:12.870 --> 01:00:12.880 align:start position:0%
representative lee is recognized thank
 
01:00:14.710 --> 01:00:14.720 align:start position:0%
you mr speaker um
 
01:00:17.109 --> 01:00:17.119 align:start position:0%
i just had a uh actually two questions
 
01:00:18.710 --> 01:00:18.720 align:start position:0%
one for the representative and one for
 
01:00:20.789 --> 01:00:20.799 align:start position:0%
the uh the chair for the speaker
 
01:00:24.390 --> 01:00:24.400 align:start position:0%
uh representative prout
 
01:00:26.230 --> 01:00:26.240 align:start position:0%
i i think if i heard you correctly you
 
01:00:27.510 --> 01:00:27.520 align:start position:0%
said this would take
 
01:00:30.549 --> 01:00:30.559 align:start position:0%
effect or this is to be effective in a
 
01:00:32.309 --> 01:00:32.319 align:start position:0%
state of emergency
 
01:00:34.150 --> 01:00:34.160 align:start position:0%
and then i i thought i heard you say or
 
01:00:36.069 --> 01:00:36.079 align:start position:0%
at a time when there is a significant
 
01:00:36.079 --> 01:00:36.870 align:start position:0%
at a time when there is a significant
reduction

01:00:36.870 --> 01:00:36.880 align:start position:0%
reduction
 
01:00:41.670 --> 01:00:41.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:43.750 --> 01:00:43.760 align:start position:0%
i i'm just trying to i may have misheard
 
01:00:45.430 --> 01:00:45.440 align:start position:0%
you on that i'm just trying to clarify
 
01:00:46.630 --> 01:00:46.640 align:start position:0%
for myself here what
 
01:00:49.349 --> 01:00:49.359 align:start position:0%
when what would be the circumstances
 
01:00:50.870 --> 01:00:50.880 align:start position:0%
that you envisioned that this would take
 
01:00:50.880 --> 01:00:51.670 align:start position:0%
that you envisioned that this would take
effect

01:00:51.670 --> 01:00:51.680 align:start position:0%
effect
 
01:00:54.870 --> 01:00:54.880 align:start position:0%
um or that this would be in effect
 
01:00:57.190 --> 01:00:57.200 align:start position:0%
you criteria two criteria the criteria
 
01:00:59.349 --> 01:00:59.359 align:start position:0%
one is this there's a state of emergency
 
01:01:00.950 --> 01:01:00.960 align:start position:0%
and criteria two that that state of
 
01:01:02.870 --> 01:01:02.880 align:start position:0%
emergency has either caused a complete
 
01:01:02.880 --> 01:01:03.510 align:start position:0%
emergency has either caused a complete
closure

01:01:03.510 --> 01:01:03.520 align:start position:0%
closure
 
01:01:05.510 --> 01:01:05.520 align:start position:0%
or a significant reduction of volume
 
01:01:07.349 --> 01:01:07.359 align:start position:0%
okay so the reduction in volume
 
01:01:10.710 --> 01:01:10.720 align:start position:0%
uh in your uh proposal would be due to
 
01:01:11.990 --> 01:01:12.000 align:start position:0%
the state of emergency
 
01:01:14.549 --> 01:01:14.559 align:start position:0%
not just for example the fact that
 
01:01:16.470 --> 01:01:16.480 align:start position:0%
people just don't want to drink
 
01:01:18.950 --> 01:01:18.960 align:start position:0%
x brand any longer and just don't feel
 
01:01:20.230 --> 01:01:20.240 align:start position:0%
like buying it
 
01:01:21.910 --> 01:01:21.920 align:start position:0%
correct what i'm thinking here is if
 
01:01:23.589 --> 01:01:23.599 align:start position:0%
restaurants are open for
 
01:01:26.309 --> 01:01:26.319 align:start position:0%
25 of normal capacity clearly they won't
 
01:01:28.710 --> 01:01:28.720 align:start position:0%
be able to sell the same volume of beer
 
01:01:32.470 --> 01:01:32.480 align:start position:0%
okay thank you um and then mr speaker
 
01:01:36.150 --> 01:01:36.160 align:start position:0%
under the current rules as they stand
 
01:01:38.390 --> 01:01:38.400 align:start position:0%
could the house consider an act on this
 
01:01:38.400 --> 01:01:39.750 align:start position:0%
could the house consider an act on this
bill

01:01:39.750 --> 01:01:39.760 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:01:41.829 --> 01:01:41.839 align:start position:0%
um given that the current rules state
 
01:01:43.990 --> 01:01:44.000 align:start position:0%
that um all house bills need to be acted
 
01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:44.870 align:start position:0%
that um all house bills need to be acted
on

01:01:44.870 --> 01:01:44.880 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:01:47.349 --> 01:01:47.359 align:start position:0%
by i think uh uh well second committee
 
01:01:48.870 --> 01:01:48.880 align:start position:0%
bills needed to be acted on by
 
01:01:52.150 --> 01:01:52.160 align:start position:0%
a date set in march
 
01:01:54.069 --> 01:01:54.079 align:start position:0%
well that's somewhat of a catch-22 let
 
01:01:57.589 --> 01:01:57.599 align:start position:0%
me ask the clerk
 
01:02:00.630 --> 01:02:00.640 align:start position:0%
mr clerk if we do not have the deadlines
 
01:02:01.910 --> 01:02:01.920 align:start position:0%
in place could this
 
01:02:05.589 --> 01:02:05.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:07.670 --> 01:02:07.680 align:start position:0%
the the short answer is is yes mr
 
01:02:10.470 --> 01:02:10.480 align:start position:0%
speaker uh similar to your cacr
 
01:02:13.589 --> 01:02:13.599 align:start position:0%
um situation is that uh
 
01:02:16.710 --> 01:02:16.720 align:start position:0%
your um your committee today can allow
 
01:02:18.549 --> 01:02:18.559 align:start position:0%
for late drafting and introduction only
 
01:02:19.270 --> 01:02:19.280 align:start position:0%
it cannot
 
01:02:21.829 --> 01:02:21.839 align:start position:0%
supersede um the other rules of the
 
01:02:21.839 --> 01:02:22.390 align:start position:0%
supersede um the other rules of the
house

01:02:22.390 --> 01:02:22.400 align:start position:0%
house
 
01:02:25.829 --> 01:02:25.839 align:start position:0%
so in order to act on them when the full
 
01:02:27.430 --> 01:02:27.440 align:start position:0%
house comes together it would still
 
01:02:29.589 --> 01:02:29.599 align:start position:0%
require two-thirds suspension
 
01:02:32.150 --> 01:02:32.160 align:start position:0%
um for all of the other rules regarding
 
01:02:33.190 --> 01:02:33.200 align:start position:0%
public hearings
 
01:02:36.470 --> 01:02:36.480 align:start position:0%
referral committee etc etc um
 
01:02:40.230 --> 01:02:40.240 align:start position:0%
but um it's that is still possible um
 
01:02:43.670 --> 01:02:43.680 align:start position:0%
under under those scenarios uh we can um
 
01:02:46.069 --> 01:02:46.079 align:start position:0%
you know we could when the house comes
 
01:02:47.510 --> 01:02:47.520 align:start position:0%
together on the 11th
 
01:02:50.230 --> 01:02:50.240 align:start position:0%
um take up every piece of legislation
 
01:02:51.990 --> 01:02:52.000 align:start position:0%
with a two-thirds suspension
 
01:02:55.510 --> 01:02:55.520 align:start position:0%
minus um uh deadlines to do that
 
01:02:59.510 --> 01:02:59.520 align:start position:0%
yeah good thanks a brief follow-up
 
01:03:02.630 --> 01:03:02.640 align:start position:0%
mr speaker so if
 
01:03:05.270 --> 01:03:05.280 align:start position:0%
for example on this bill um the house
 
01:03:07.670 --> 01:03:07.680 align:start position:0%
voted by a two-thirds margin to suspend
 
01:03:10.549 --> 01:03:10.559 align:start position:0%
the rules to allow
 
01:03:19.349 --> 01:03:19.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:22.870 --> 01:03:22.880 align:start position:0%
okay thank you uh
 
01:03:25.430 --> 01:03:25.440 align:start position:0%
so if um the house were to take up this
 
01:03:27.349 --> 01:03:27.359 align:start position:0%
bill vote to suspend rules to take up
 
01:03:28.069 --> 01:03:28.079 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:03:29.750 --> 01:03:29.760 align:start position:0%
does the bill need to pass by a
 
01:03:31.510 --> 01:03:31.520 align:start position:0%
two-thirds vote or is it a simple
 
01:03:32.870 --> 01:03:32.880 align:start position:0%
majority then
 
01:03:35.190 --> 01:03:35.200 align:start position:0%
so so if we suspend all rules uh
 
01:03:36.230 --> 01:03:36.240 align:start position:0%
regarding um
 
01:03:39.430 --> 01:03:39.440 align:start position:0%
everything to get to this point um then
