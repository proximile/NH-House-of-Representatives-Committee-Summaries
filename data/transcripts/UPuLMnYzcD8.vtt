00:10:55.949 --> 00:10:55.959 align:start position:0%

00:11:02.230 --> 00:11:02.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:09.160 align:start position:0%
 
each

00:11:09.170 --> 00:11:10.910 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

00:11:10.910 --> 00:11:10.920 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:11:13.829 --> 00:11:13.839 align:start position:0%
okay all right I think we have our
 
00:11:16.430 --> 00:11:16.440 align:start position:0%
attendance squared away here so we'll
 
00:11:17.990 --> 00:11:18.000 align:start position:0%
get started on our
 
00:11:22.110 --> 00:11:22.120 align:start position:0%
business um as everyone I'm sure knows
 
00:11:25.190 --> 00:11:25.200 align:start position:0%
we have four bills that we voted to
 
00:11:28.629 --> 00:11:28.639 align:start position:0%
interim study and now we're here to
 
00:11:31.230 --> 00:11:31.240 align:start position:0%
address those bills uh just so
 
00:11:32.949 --> 00:11:32.959 align:start position:0%
everyone's clear on what we're doing
 
00:11:36.230 --> 00:11:36.240 align:start position:0%
today our vote today will be either to
 
00:11:38.870 --> 00:11:38.880 align:start position:0%
recommend for future legislation or to
 
00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:39.710 align:start position:0%
recommend for future legislation or to
not

00:11:39.710 --> 00:11:39.720 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:42.310 align:start position:0%
not
recommend

00:11:42.310 --> 00:11:42.320 align:start position:0%
recommend
 
00:11:46.509 --> 00:11:46.519 align:start position:0%
um unlike a bill during the regular
 
00:11:49.310 --> 00:11:49.320 align:start position:0%
session this isn't a minority majority
 
00:11:53.910 --> 00:11:53.920 align:start position:0%
report what whichever we vote to do um
 
00:11:57.430 --> 00:11:57.440 align:start position:0%
we will write a a blurb for the calendar
 
00:12:01.550 --> 00:12:01.560 align:start position:0%
that explains why we voted the way we
 
00:12:05.990 --> 00:12:06.000 align:start position:0%
did um I was reminded by our committee
 
00:12:09.350 --> 00:12:09.360 align:start position:0%
assistant that we close to the due date
 
00:12:11.430 --> 00:12:11.440 align:start position:0%
for the calendar so whoever makes the
 
00:12:15.030 --> 00:12:15.040 align:start position:0%
motion and writes the blurb I'd ask you
 
00:12:17.629 --> 00:12:17.639 align:start position:0%
uh if you're going to handw write
 
00:12:20.230 --> 00:12:20.240 align:start position:0%
something if you could do it before you
 
00:12:22.710 --> 00:12:22.720 align:start position:0%
leave if you want to send in something
 
00:12:26.310 --> 00:12:26.320 align:start position:0%
electronically please um send it to me
 
00:12:29.829 --> 00:12:29.839 align:start position:0%
as soon as possible um
 
00:12:32.590 --> 00:12:32.600 align:start position:0%
I guess if you do want to go home and
 
00:12:34.629 --> 00:12:34.639 align:start position:0%
work on it at night if you can have it
 
00:12:38.110 --> 00:12:38.120 align:start position:0%
to me by noon tomorrow that would really
 
00:12:41.470 --> 00:12:41.480 align:start position:0%
be helpful um to make our
 
00:12:44.150 --> 00:12:44.160 align:start position:0%
deadlines so with that said we'll move
 
00:12:47.629 --> 00:12:47.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:50.870 --> 00:12:50.880 align:start position:0%
hb17 um this is relative to the notice
 
00:12:53.230 --> 00:12:53.240 align:start position:0%
of terms and conditions of remote work
 
00:12:55.670 --> 00:12:55.680 align:start position:0%
Arrangements uh representative Prout you
 
00:12:58.310 --> 00:12:58.320 align:start position:0%
have a motion I move to not recommend
 
00:13:00.670 --> 00:13:00.680 align:start position:0%
for future legisl
 
00:13:04.470 --> 00:13:04.480 align:start position:0%
is there a second second I'm going
 
00:13:07.069 --> 00:13:07.079 align:start position:0%
to have a
 
00:13:10.230 --> 00:13:10.240 align:start position:0%
bipartisan uh a representation here and
 
00:13:13.670 --> 00:13:13.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:17.230 --> 00:13:17.240 align:start position:0%
seconded the um so this is
 
00:13:19.069 --> 00:13:19.079 align:start position:0%
representative Prout and we'll make this
 
00:13:19.079 --> 00:13:20.629 align:start position:0%
representative Prout and we'll make this
K

00:13:20.629 --> 00:13:20.639 align:start position:0%
K
 
00:13:22.870 --> 00:13:22.880 align:start position:0%
kill and representative proud if you'd
 
00:13:26.389 --> 00:13:26.399 align:start position:0%
like to speak to your motion thank you
 
00:13:27.629 --> 00:13:27.639 align:start position:0%
uh I don't really see the need for this
 
00:13:29.870 --> 00:13:29.880 align:start position:0%
bill or really what what this bill will
 
00:13:31.590 --> 00:13:31.600 align:start position:0%
accomplish um there's no prohibition
 
00:13:33.110 --> 00:13:33.120 align:start position:0%
against an employer or an employee
 
00:13:34.629 --> 00:13:34.639 align:start position:0%
entering into a written agreement for
 
00:13:36.790 --> 00:13:36.800 align:start position:0%
regarding remote work now uh there's
 
00:13:38.590 --> 00:13:38.600 align:start position:0%
also no prohibition against in this bill
 
00:13:40.430 --> 00:13:40.440 align:start position:0%
or otherwise against an employer
 
00:13:42.110 --> 00:13:42.120 align:start position:0%
changing or revoking a remote work
 
00:13:43.990 --> 00:13:44.000 align:start position:0%
agreement and this bill doesn't limit
 
00:13:45.550 --> 00:13:45.560 align:start position:0%
that either not that I would like it if
 
00:13:48.829 --> 00:13:48.839 align:start position:0%
it did um by forcing an agreement to be
 
00:13:50.749 --> 00:13:50.759 align:start position:0%
made and written down it kind of locks
 
00:13:52.670 --> 00:13:52.680 align:start position:0%
in all parties which may not be
 
00:13:54.990 --> 00:13:55.000 align:start position:0%
desirable um you know part of the
 
00:13:57.269 --> 00:13:57.279 align:start position:0%
benefits of remote work is flexibility
 
00:13:59.110 --> 00:13:59.120 align:start position:0%
see I have a laptop in front of me
 
00:14:00.430 --> 00:14:00.440 align:start position:0%
before the hearing gabbled in I was
 
00:14:03.189 --> 00:14:03.199 align:start position:0%
doing some work this is just how life is
 
00:14:05.670 --> 00:14:05.680 align:start position:0%
becoming these days
 
00:14:07.790 --> 00:14:07.800 align:start position:0%
um and if something comes up that's
 
00:14:09.550 --> 00:14:09.560 align:start position:0%
outside the agreement now it has to be
 
00:14:11.629 --> 00:14:11.639 align:start position:0%
edited and reapproved through whatever
 
00:14:14.430 --> 00:14:14.440 align:start position:0%
process or it's invalid or you're
 
00:14:16.870 --> 00:14:16.880 align:start position:0%
just the status quo doesn't match their
 
00:14:18.470 --> 00:14:18.480 align:start position:0%
agreement which can bring in its own
 
00:14:20.590 --> 00:14:20.600 align:start position:0%
problems and that's just all adding a
 
00:14:22.870 --> 00:14:22.880 align:start position:0%
lot of work without I don't think an
 
00:14:25.189 --> 00:14:25.199 align:start position:0%
identified benefit um and so that's a
 
00:14:28.430 --> 00:14:28.440 align:start position:0%
reason at least uh with what's been
 
00:14:29.910 --> 00:14:29.920 align:start position:0%
discussed so far we GR in this bill
 
00:14:31.230 --> 00:14:31.240 align:start position:0%
what's in this bill what been discussed
 
00:14:32.990 --> 00:14:33.000 align:start position:0%
I don't see why it would be a good thing
 
00:14:35.430 --> 00:14:35.440 align:start position:0%
to recommend for future legislation
 
00:14:37.670 --> 00:14:37.680 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
00:14:41.189 --> 00:14:41.199 align:start position:0%
kahill thank you Mr chair and and as uh
 
00:14:44.189 --> 00:14:44.199 align:start position:0%
my colleague Mr Prout acknowledged uh
 
00:14:46.030 --> 00:14:46.040 align:start position:0%
and as we had in the hearing way back in
 
00:14:48.710 --> 00:14:48.720 align:start position:0%
January this is a the thing today so
 
00:14:51.069 --> 00:14:51.079 align:start position:0%
many people are working remotely and it
 
00:14:53.710 --> 00:14:53.720 align:start position:0%
is best practices to have an
 
00:14:55.870 --> 00:14:55.880 align:start position:0%
understanding with flexibility you know
 
00:14:57.310 --> 00:14:57.320 align:start position:0%
between the employer and the and the
 
00:14:59.590 --> 00:14:59.600 align:start position:0%
employee that this is what with what
 
00:15:01.430 --> 00:15:01.440 align:start position:0%
we're doing now and it could change
 
00:15:04.189 --> 00:15:04.199 align:start position:0%
because this happens or that happens but
 
00:15:05.710 --> 00:15:05.720 align:start position:0%
it's it's a good thing to talk about but
 
00:15:08.790 --> 00:15:08.800 align:start position:0%
I don't think we need to legislate it
 
00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:09.670 align:start position:0%
I don't think we need to legislate it
thank

00:15:09.670 --> 00:15:09.680 align:start position:0%
thank
 
00:15:12.470 --> 00:15:12.480 align:start position:0%
you representative buudy thank you Mr
 
00:15:15.430 --> 00:15:15.440 align:start position:0%
chairman um people have been working
 
00:15:19.590 --> 00:15:19.600 align:start position:0%
remote for a lot longer than we think um
 
00:15:21.509 --> 00:15:21.519 align:start position:0%
a young lady friend of mine has been
 
00:15:24.110 --> 00:15:24.120 align:start position:0%
doing it for 15 years for the hospital
 
00:15:26.670 --> 00:15:26.680 align:start position:0%
she's got a pretty big job and she works
 
00:15:29.829 --> 00:15:29.839 align:start position:0%
from home never had a problem
 
00:15:32.910 --> 00:15:32.920 align:start position:0%
my son does work with people all around
 
00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:33.710 align:start position:0%
my son does work with people all around
the

00:15:33.710 --> 00:15:33.720 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:15:36.350 --> 00:15:36.360 align:start position:0%
country he's he's working from home
 
00:15:38.829 --> 00:15:38.839 align:start position:0%
without a problem his employer just
 
00:15:42.230 --> 00:15:42.240 align:start position:0%
offered him a a new contract uh and it's
 
00:15:45.550 --> 00:15:45.560 align:start position:0%
unbelievable so I think when you work
 
00:15:48.949 --> 00:15:48.959 align:start position:0%
from home is performance Bas either you
 
00:15:51.710 --> 00:15:51.720 align:start position:0%
do the job or you don't and it's not
 
00:15:53.710 --> 00:15:53.720 align:start position:0%
like working we all have to work
 
00:15:56.189 --> 00:15:56.199 align:start position:0%
together and get along and play nice I
 
00:15:58.150 --> 00:15:58.160 align:start position:0%
think that when you're on your own
 
00:15:59.910 --> 00:15:59.920 align:start position:0%
you're on your own to either sink or
 
00:16:03.189 --> 00:16:03.199 align:start position:0%
swim you either do the job or you don't
 
00:16:05.590 --> 00:16:05.600 align:start position:0%
and um I don't see a need for
 
00:16:08.309 --> 00:16:08.319 align:start position:0%
legislation on this we're seeing a lot
 
00:16:11.350 --> 00:16:11.360 align:start position:0%
more of it and maybe down the road we'll
 
00:16:12.910 --> 00:16:12.920 align:start position:0%
have to do something but I don't think
 
00:16:14.550 --> 00:16:14.560 align:start position:0%
Now's the
 
00:16:19.110 --> 00:16:19.120 align:start position:0%

was easy let's move along um next up HB
 
00:17:51.990 --> 00:17:52.000 align:start position:0%
1023 which is relative to requiring
 
00:17:54.070 --> 00:17:54.080 align:start position:0%
employers to provide notice of resources
 
00:17:55.990 --> 00:17:56.000 align:start position:0%
available to support veterans with
 
00:17:59.110 --> 00:17:59.120 align:start position:0%
post-traumatic stress disorder
 
00:18:01.990 --> 00:18:02.000 align:start position:0%
um and I'll start this off by looking
 
00:18:04.990 --> 00:18:05.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:08.149 --> 00:18:08.159 align:start position:0%
motion Mr chairman I move not to
 
00:18:13.750 --> 00:18:13.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:18.310 --> 00:18:18.320 align:start position:0%
second uh representative Drago
 
00:18:23.310 --> 00:18:23.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:25.990 --> 00:18:26.000 align:start position:0%
okay for the last day I think I'll try
 
00:18:29.789 --> 00:18:29.799 align:start position:0%
to get it right um do you want me to
 
00:18:31.350 --> 00:18:31.360 align:start position:0%
comment on this or would you like to
 
00:18:33.669 --> 00:18:33.679 align:start position:0%
speak it's completely up to the chairman
 
00:18:36.190 --> 00:18:36.200 align:start position:0%
all right I I will uh introduce this and
 
00:18:38.470 --> 00:18:38.480 align:start position:0%
if you have something to add
 
00:18:43.310 --> 00:18:43.320 align:start position:0%
so we held this bill if if uh the
 
00:18:45.669 --> 00:18:45.679 align:start position:0%
members of the Comm committee remember
 
00:18:49.310 --> 00:18:49.320 align:start position:0%
because the sponsored submitted two
 
00:18:51.149 --> 00:18:51.159 align:start position:0%
versions of the bill one in the Senate
 
00:18:53.990 --> 00:18:54.000 align:start position:0%
one in the house and it was their
 
00:18:57.110 --> 00:18:57.120 align:start position:0%
preference that they focus on the the
 
00:19:00.590 --> 00:19:00.600 align:start position:0%
Senate version and and since we hadn't
 
00:19:03.029 --> 00:19:03.039 align:start position:0%
gotten that yet we thought it prudent
 
00:19:06.350 --> 00:19:06.360 align:start position:0%
rather than to itl the bill and con
 
00:19:08.830 --> 00:19:08.840 align:start position:0%
create some kind of confusing message
 
00:19:11.190 --> 00:19:11.200 align:start position:0%
that we'd interim study it with the
 
00:19:12.909 --> 00:19:12.919 align:start position:0%
intention that we'd work on the Senate
 
00:19:15.669 --> 00:19:15.679 align:start position:0%
Bill we did indeed get the Senate Bill
 
00:19:18.750 --> 00:19:18.760 align:start position:0%
we passed it it has been signed by the
 
00:19:24.350 --> 00:19:24.360 align:start position:0%
governor um so the reason that I think
 
00:19:27.190 --> 00:19:27.200 align:start position:0%
we want to not recommend this bill is
 
00:19:30.110 --> 00:19:30.120 align:start position:0%
that it's already in law and is not
 
00:19:32.630 --> 00:19:32.640 align:start position:0%
necessary representative avalani if you
 
00:19:34.830 --> 00:19:34.840 align:start position:0%
have any further is Fantastic Mr
 
00:19:36.510 --> 00:19:36.520 align:start position:0%
chairman any other
 
00:19:39.110 --> 00:19:39.120 align:start position:0%
comments represent Broody thank you Mr
 
00:19:40.950 --> 00:19:40.960 align:start position:0%
chairman I
 
00:19:44.110 --> 00:19:44.120 align:start position:0%
um I don't remember what was passed by
 
00:19:46.710 --> 00:19:46.720 align:start position:0%
the senate i
 
00:19:49.190 --> 00:19:49.200 align:start position:0%
i it's like a couple years
 
00:19:52.990 --> 00:19:53.000 align:start position:0%
ago as far as I'm thinking but I I
 
00:19:56.710 --> 00:19:56.720 align:start position:0%
um I um I'm a very active member with
 
00:19:58.710 --> 00:19:58.720 align:start position:0%
the legion and I know that they were
 
00:20:01.590 --> 00:20:01.600 align:start position:0%
watching this and um I already told them
 
00:20:03.350 --> 00:20:03.360 align:start position:0%
that I was going to further recommend
 
00:20:06.350 --> 00:20:06.360 align:start position:0%
something so I'm going to go that route
 
00:20:08.190 --> 00:20:08.200 align:start position:0%
um when it comes to Veterans and
 
00:20:09.950 --> 00:20:09.960 align:start position:0%
especially uh
 
00:20:13.909 --> 00:20:13.919 align:start position:0%
PTSD um we have some members that have
 
00:20:17.310 --> 00:20:17.320 align:start position:0%
it and it's always worth looking at as
 
00:20:19.070 --> 00:20:19.080 align:start position:0%
far as I'm
 
00:20:22.149 --> 00:20:22.159 align:start position:0%
concerned so the Senate bill to answer
 
00:20:25.110 --> 00:20:25.120 align:start position:0%
your question was Senate Bill
 
00:20:30.630 --> 00:20:30.640 align:start position:0%
588 um I what I am not I did not check
 
00:20:33.070 --> 00:20:33.080 align:start position:0%
word for word to see if it was the two
 
00:20:34.430 --> 00:20:34.440 align:start position:0%
versions were
 
00:20:37.789 --> 00:20:37.799 align:start position:0%
identical um I I recall they were
 
00:20:40.750 --> 00:20:40.760 align:start position:0%
substantially the same at least if not
 
00:20:41.750 --> 00:20:41.760 align:start position:0%
the same
 
00:20:45.630 --> 00:20:45.640 align:start position:0%
bill and again
 
00:20:48.870 --> 00:20:48.880 align:start position:0%
the I think the key Point here is that
 
00:20:53.190 --> 00:20:53.200 align:start position:0%
we did pass this language in this term
 
00:20:55.430 --> 00:20:55.440 align:start position:0%
and it has been signed by the governor
 
00:21:00.830 --> 00:21:00.840 align:start position:0%
and it is law um I understand and your
 
00:21:03.909 --> 00:21:03.919 align:start position:0%
comment that we can
 
00:21:06.950 --> 00:21:06.960 align:start position:0%
always look to see if we have further
 
00:21:09.350 --> 00:21:09.360 align:start position:0%
deficiencies in how we're taking care of
 
00:21:09.360 --> 00:21:10.230 align:start position:0%
deficiencies in how we're taking care of
our

00:21:10.230 --> 00:21:10.240 align:start position:0%
our
 
00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:13.549 align:start position:0%
our
veterans

00:21:13.549 --> 00:21:13.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:17.870 --> 00:21:17.880 align:start position:0%
um but in terms of this specific
 
00:21:21.830 --> 00:21:21.840 align:start position:0%
bill I think the the house has taken
 
00:21:24.350 --> 00:21:24.360 align:start position:0%
care of it by passing the Senate
 
00:21:27.510 --> 00:21:27.520 align:start position:0%
version other members of the committee
 
00:21:29.350 --> 00:21:29.360 align:start position:0%
uh representative paral
 
00:21:30.950 --> 00:21:30.960 align:start position:0%
thank you so much I do see the Senate
 
00:21:34.789 --> 00:21:34.799 align:start position:0%
version was amended and many of my uh
 
00:21:36.549 --> 00:21:36.559 align:start position:0%
concerns about the house bill The Way It
 
00:21:37.909 --> 00:21:37.919 align:start position:0%
Was Written seem to be answered in the
 
00:21:42.990 --> 00:21:43.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:48.110 --> 00:21:48.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:51.149 --> 00:21:51.159 align:start position:0%
you um I don't know if it would be
 
00:21:54.350 --> 00:21:54.360 align:start position:0%
helpful to any of the members
 
00:21:58.350 --> 00:21:58.360 align:start position:0%
to go into a a bit of detail on on what
 
00:22:00.710 --> 00:22:00.720 align:start position:0%
was was in the Senate bill and what was
 
00:22:03.350 --> 00:22:03.360 align:start position:0%
improved about it if I don't want to put
 
00:22:05.350 --> 00:22:05.360 align:start position:0%
you on the spot but if you have a
 
00:22:07.310 --> 00:22:07.320 align:start position:0%
further comment members might find it
 
00:22:09.269 --> 00:22:09.279 align:start position:0%
helpful one particular aspect of it is
 
00:22:11.350 --> 00:22:11.360 align:start position:0%
that the Labor Commissioner in
 
00:22:13.190 --> 00:22:13.200 align:start position:0%
consultation with the Department of
 
00:22:15.110 --> 00:22:15.120 align:start position:0%
Business and economic Affairs and the
 
00:22:17.549 --> 00:22:17.559 align:start position:0%
office of Workforce opportunity shall
 
00:22:19.350 --> 00:22:19.360 align:start position:0%
create and distribute to employees a
 
00:22:21.350 --> 00:22:21.360 align:start position:0%
veterans Benefit Service notice or
 
00:22:25.149 --> 00:22:25.159 align:start position:0%
poster and the in the house version that
 
00:22:27.870 --> 00:22:27.880 align:start position:0%
say one would be created here there have
 
00:22:29.430 --> 00:22:29.440 align:start position:0%
an actual clear path of who's
 
00:22:32.990 --> 00:22:33.000 align:start position:0%
responsible for that um I don't know I'm
 
00:22:35.510 --> 00:22:35.520 align:start position:0%
still concerned about posting it uh the
 
00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:37.549 align:start position:0%
still concerned about posting it uh the
uh

00:22:37.549 --> 00:22:37.559 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:22:43.350 --> 00:22:43.360 align:start position:0%
um the penalty for non-compliance I uh I
 
00:22:44.789 --> 00:22:44.799 align:start position:0%
think probably most your noncompliance
 
00:22:46.350 --> 00:22:46.360 align:start position:0%
is going to come from this ignorance not
 
00:22:49.630 --> 00:22:49.640 align:start position:0%
from willful um neglect so I'm really
 
00:22:50.789 --> 00:22:50.799 align:start position:0%
questioning whether or not we need a
 
00:22:52.630 --> 00:22:52.640 align:start position:0%
warning system before we start finding
 
00:22:55.110 --> 00:22:55.120 align:start position:0%
people but this does but I can I'm very
 
00:22:56.510 --> 00:22:56.520 align:start position:0%
happy with this particular
 
00:22:59.310 --> 00:22:59.320 align:start position:0%
situation and I will respond to that
 
00:23:01.870 --> 00:23:01.880 align:start position:0%
members of this committee especially
 
00:23:03.430 --> 00:23:03.440 align:start position:0%
those of us that have been here a number
 
00:23:07.710 --> 00:23:07.720 align:start position:0%
of terms recall that in fact uh we
 
00:23:09.470 --> 00:23:09.480 align:start position:0%
modify the
 
00:23:13.669 --> 00:23:13.679 align:start position:0%
way labor penalties and the fines apply
 
00:23:17.830 --> 00:23:17.840 align:start position:0%
so that in the exception of generally
 
00:23:22.230 --> 00:23:22.240 align:start position:0%
failure to pay wages um any
 
00:23:25.470 --> 00:23:25.480 align:start position:0%
non-compliance is first addressed with a
 
00:23:28.870 --> 00:23:28.880 align:start position:0%
warning and only on repeated offense
 
00:23:31.110 --> 00:23:31.120 align:start position:0%
does it go to a fine sounds reasonable
 
00:23:35.070 --> 00:23:35.080 align:start position:0%
thank you further
 
00:23:37.590 --> 00:23:37.600 align:start position:0%
comments representative Susi thank you
 
00:23:39.870 --> 00:23:39.880 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman um someone who's actually
 
00:23:42.110 --> 00:23:42.120 align:start position:0%
now serving on the um commission to
 
00:23:43.990 --> 00:23:44.000 align:start position:0%
study PTSD for First
 
00:23:48.190 --> 00:23:48.200 align:start position:0%
Responders um I have to agree with um
 
00:23:49.669 --> 00:23:49.679 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman that I think the
 
00:23:51.029 --> 00:23:51.039 align:start position:0%
legislation at this point if it's
 
00:23:52.789 --> 00:23:52.799 align:start position:0%
already been signed into law I think if
 
00:23:54.510 --> 00:23:54.520 align:start position:0%
there is an issue later on the bill can
 
00:23:56.070 --> 00:23:56.080 align:start position:0%
be looked at again the legislation can
 
00:23:57.390 --> 00:23:57.400 align:start position:0%
be looked at again and it can be tweaked
 
00:23:58.750 --> 00:23:58.760 align:start position:0%
somewhere but I'm happy happy with the
 
00:24:00.310 --> 00:24:00.320 align:start position:0%
way it is so I'll be voting in favor
 
00:24:00.320 --> 00:24:02.710 align:start position:0%
way it is so I'll be voting in favor

motion thank you Mr chairman I move to
 
00:25:23.669 --> 00:25:23.679 align:start position:0%
not recommend this future
 
00:25:26.470 --> 00:25:26.480 align:start position:0%
legislation thank you is there a
 
00:25:29.269 --> 00:25:29.279 align:start position:0%
second representative proud his second
 
00:25:33.350 --> 00:25:33.360 align:start position:0%
is um would you again like me to start
 
00:25:35.630 --> 00:25:35.640 align:start position:0%
out by refreshing the committee's me
 
00:25:38.190 --> 00:25:38.200 align:start position:0%
memory with what this is that would be
 
00:25:41.990 --> 00:25:42.000 align:start position:0%
um this was a bill that was submitted to
 
00:25:44.630 --> 00:25:44.640 align:start position:0%
address the situation of what the bill
 
00:25:46.870 --> 00:25:46.880 align:start position:0%
called freelance
 
00:25:51.789 --> 00:25:51.799 align:start position:0%
employees um and wanted to extend
 
00:25:57.149 --> 00:25:57.159 align:start position:0%
to this class of of worker some
 
00:25:59.029 --> 00:25:59.039 align:start position:0%
protections that
 
00:26:01.710 --> 00:26:01.720 align:start position:0%
doe statutory
 
00:26:07.389 --> 00:26:07.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:10.549 --> 00:26:10.559 align:start position:0%
time I think the
 
00:26:12.870 --> 00:26:12.880 align:start position:0%
committee certainly a majority of the
 
00:26:15.110 --> 00:26:15.120 align:start position:0%
committee Mo I don't know if it was
 
00:26:18.190 --> 00:26:18.200 align:start position:0%
everyone um but was not in favor of the
 
00:26:21.950 --> 00:26:21.960 align:start position:0%
bill to me the the simplest explanation
 
00:26:24.389 --> 00:26:24.399 align:start position:0%
is that
 
00:26:27.149 --> 00:26:27.159 align:start position:0%
Freelancers are not employees they're
 
00:26:29.230 --> 00:26:29.240 align:start position:0%
independent contractors
 
00:26:32.630 --> 00:26:32.640 align:start position:0%
if a freelancer wants the protection do
 
00:26:35.950 --> 00:26:35.960 align:start position:0%
an employee they should seek employment
 
00:26:38.750 --> 00:26:38.760 align:start position:0%
and and then the law covers them I think
 
00:26:41.669 --> 00:26:41.679 align:start position:0%
there's a concern that if we start to
 
00:26:45.070 --> 00:26:45.080 align:start position:0%
blur that distinction between an
 
00:26:47.669 --> 00:26:47.679 align:start position:0%
independent contractor and employee
 
00:26:50.190 --> 00:26:50.200 align:start position:0%
we're going to
 
00:26:53.149 --> 00:26:53.159 align:start position:0%
recreate the problems that we've spent
 
00:26:56.389 --> 00:26:56.399 align:start position:0%
years trying to fix with employee
 
00:26:58.590 --> 00:26:58.600 align:start position:0%
misclassification the reason we didn't
 
00:27:01.950 --> 00:27:01.960 align:start position:0%
simply itl this bill is that the
 
00:27:06.789 --> 00:27:06.799 align:start position:0%
sponsor was asked to work with the
 
00:27:07.950 --> 00:27:07.960 align:start position:0%
Department of
 
00:27:11.789 --> 00:27:11.799 align:start position:0%
Labor um to see what in the
 
00:27:15.269 --> 00:27:15.279 align:start position:0%
existing laws and rules might apply to
 
00:27:18.350 --> 00:27:18.360 align:start position:0%
the situation and help the individuals
 
00:27:22.110 --> 00:27:22.120 align:start position:0%
that the the law sought to benefit I
 
00:27:25.070 --> 00:27:25.080 align:start position:0%
have not heard that meetings took place
 
00:27:27.389 --> 00:27:27.399 align:start position:0%
but we wanted to have an interim study
 
00:27:30.149 --> 00:27:30.159 align:start position:0%
to be a a forum if
 
00:27:30.159 --> 00:27:32.230 align:start position:0%
to be a a forum if
necessary

00:27:32.230 --> 00:27:32.240 align:start position:0%
necessary
 
00:27:36.590 --> 00:27:36.600 align:start position:0%
um so for that reason I think we didn't
 
00:27:39.310 --> 00:27:39.320 align:start position:0%
support this bill back in the the spring
 
00:27:42.430 --> 00:27:42.440 align:start position:0%
when we first had it I think for the
 
00:27:44.230 --> 00:27:44.240 align:start position:0%
reasons that I just stated it makes
 
00:27:46.950 --> 00:27:46.960 align:start position:0%
sense to not recommend a future version
 
00:27:48.669 --> 00:27:48.679 align:start position:0%
representative Susi thank you Mr
 
00:27:51.990 --> 00:27:52.000 align:start position:0%
chairman so representative Soloman um
 
00:27:54.630 --> 00:27:54.640 align:start position:0%
advised us that he's talked to the prime
 
00:27:56.870 --> 00:27:56.880 align:start position:0%
sponsor and there really hasn't been
 
00:27:59.750 --> 00:27:59.760 align:start position:0%
much work on it so the prime spot pretty
 
00:28:01.389 --> 00:28:01.399 align:start position:0%
much says that it's not ready for prime
 
00:28:03.710 --> 00:28:03.720 align:start position:0%
time so we'd support the no further
 
00:28:05.909 --> 00:28:05.919 align:start position:0%
legislation thank
 
00:28:10.350 --> 00:28:10.360 align:start position:0%

a favorite of mine this term HB 1597
 
00:29:35.190 --> 00:29:35.200 align:start position:0%
relative to the maximum weekly
 
00:29:37.750 --> 00:29:37.760 align:start position:0%
unemployment benefit
 
00:29:40.190 --> 00:29:40.200 align:start position:0%
amount representative aana you have a
 
00:29:42.990 --> 00:29:43.000 align:start position:0%
motion thank you Mr chairman I move to
 
00:29:46.830 --> 00:29:46.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:50.710 --> 00:29:50.720 align:start position:0%
time um is there a
 
00:29:53.750 --> 00:29:53.760 align:start position:0%
second represent of kahill has
 
00:29:55.909 --> 00:29:55.919 align:start position:0%
seconded you want to do you want me do
 
00:29:58.789 --> 00:29:58.799 align:start position:0%
it why don't you say your piece and then
 
00:30:00.470 --> 00:30:00.480 align:start position:0%
I'll jump thank you Mr chairman turn
 
00:30:02.669 --> 00:30:02.679 align:start position:0%
your mic on thank you Mr chairman um as
 
00:30:05.470 --> 00:30:05.480 align:start position:0%
everybody has known um this only deals
 
00:30:08.269 --> 00:30:08.279 align:start position:0%
with the parttime benefit um that would
 
00:30:12.230 --> 00:30:12.240 align:start position:0%
allow part-time work before um uh
 
00:30:15.269 --> 00:30:15.279 align:start position:0%
unemployment wages are reduced uh as we
 
00:30:16.630 --> 00:30:16.640 align:start position:0%
were looking through the year we had two
 
00:30:17.950 --> 00:30:17.960 align:start position:0%
bills coming over that were going to
 
00:30:21.230 --> 00:30:21.240 align:start position:0%
overhaul the unemployment
 
00:30:24.269 --> 00:30:24.279 align:start position:0%
system and change their ratios and
 
00:30:26.590 --> 00:30:26.600 align:start position:0%
numbers and we were looking at this
 
00:30:27.990 --> 00:30:28.000 align:start position:0%
prior to that happening which we
 
00:30:30.070 --> 00:30:30.080 align:start position:0%
couldn't get the numbers for because we
 
00:30:32.230 --> 00:30:32.240 align:start position:0%
everything was in flux um I think it
 
00:30:34.070 --> 00:30:34.080 align:start position:0%
should be looked at together down the
 
00:30:36.149 --> 00:30:36.159 align:start position:0%
road when we're making changes to the
 
00:30:37.870 --> 00:30:37.880 align:start position:0%
full unemployment system and then look
 
00:30:39.430 --> 00:30:39.440 align:start position:0%
at the part-time unemployment system
 
00:30:41.669 --> 00:30:41.679 align:start position:0%
that way the numbers will work in a very
 
00:30:44.630 --> 00:30:44.640 align:start position:0%
cohesive manner thank you Mr chairman
 
00:30:48.350 --> 00:30:48.360 align:start position:0%
thank you and um I will agree with
 
00:30:50.509 --> 00:30:50.519 align:start position:0%
everything the representative
 
00:30:54.990 --> 00:30:55.000 align:start position:0%
said I think the to me the motion to not
 
00:30:59.710 --> 00:30:59.720 align:start position:0%
recommend is not a
 
00:31:04.029 --> 00:31:04.039 align:start position:0%
um we're not saying that this is not
 
00:31:08.149 --> 00:31:08.159 align:start position:0%
some not something to be looked at um as
 
00:31:10.669 --> 00:31:10.679 align:start position:0%
some of the members know I did spend a
 
00:31:13.909 --> 00:31:13.919 align:start position:0%
lot of time with this I like the concept
 
00:31:17.470 --> 00:31:17.480 align:start position:0%
but the majority of the committee found
 
00:31:20.389 --> 00:31:20.399 align:start position:0%
the original concept which was to have
 
00:31:24.070 --> 00:31:24.080 align:start position:0%
some kind of partial sharing between uh
 
00:31:26.509 --> 00:31:26.519 align:start position:0%
what the employee keeps from part-time
 
00:31:30.269 --> 00:31:30.279 align:start position:0%
work and what comes out out of your uh
 
00:31:33.269 --> 00:31:33.279 align:start position:0%
unemployment benefits check was too
 
00:31:36.190 --> 00:31:36.200 align:start position:0%
complicated and when we get
 
00:31:40.350 --> 00:31:40.360 align:start position:0%
complicated we might incentivize things
 
00:31:42.950 --> 00:31:42.960 align:start position:0%
that we didn't intend to Cen incentivize
 
00:31:42.960 --> 00:31:44.269 align:start position:0%
that we didn't intend to Cen incentivize
so

00:31:44.269 --> 00:31:44.279 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:31:47.549 --> 00:31:47.559 align:start position:0%
they committee several of the members
 
00:31:50.070 --> 00:31:50.080 align:start position:0%
had some simpler ideas that might work
 
00:31:52.830 --> 00:31:52.840 align:start position:0%
but as uh the representative
 
00:31:55.190 --> 00:31:55.200 align:start position:0%
explained I don't think it makes sense
 
00:31:58.590 --> 00:31:58.600 align:start position:0%
to do this outside of addressing
 
00:32:03.029 --> 00:32:03.039 align:start position:0%
the unemployment benefit as a whole um
 
00:32:06.149 --> 00:32:06.159 align:start position:0%
because if you make changes to one but
 
00:32:07.389 --> 00:32:07.399 align:start position:0%
you don't know what the changes are
 
00:32:09.350 --> 00:32:09.360 align:start position:0%
going to be to the other then you can't
 
00:32:13.590 --> 00:32:13.600 align:start position:0%
predict the effect um so in writing this
 
00:32:16.070 --> 00:32:16.080 align:start position:0%
up I think we want to explain that that
 
00:32:18.590 --> 00:32:18.600 align:start position:0%
the the concept is worth looking at but
 
00:32:21.950 --> 00:32:21.960 align:start position:0%
in the context of the bigger picture of
 
00:32:25.909 --> 00:32:25.919 align:start position:0%
and to put it simply we haven't updated
 
00:32:30.549 --> 00:32:30.559 align:start position:0%
the um the tables that specify how much
 
00:32:34.110 --> 00:32:34.120 align:start position:0%
unemployment benefit you get for I think
 
00:32:36.750 --> 00:32:36.760 align:start position:0%
18 years was the number that I remember
 
00:32:40.070 --> 00:32:40.080 align:start position:0%
and um it really needs to
 
00:32:44.750 --> 00:32:44.760 align:start position:0%
be looked at again in light of uh what
 
00:32:46.149 --> 00:32:46.159 align:start position:0%
inflation has
 
00:32:48.870 --> 00:32:48.880 align:start position:0%
done I think when we sent this to
 
00:32:51.509 --> 00:32:51.519 align:start position:0%
interim study we fully expected that
 
00:32:53.950 --> 00:32:53.960 align:start position:0%
there was a bipartisan version that was
 
00:32:56.549 --> 00:32:56.559 align:start position:0%
going to come through that didn't happen
 
00:32:59.789 --> 00:32:59.799 align:start position:0%
uh but I certainly expect to see that
 
00:33:02.990 --> 00:33:03.000 align:start position:0%
work continue in the next
 
00:33:09.950 --> 00:33:09.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:13.470 --> 00:33:13.480 align:start position:0%

completed our business today in near
 
00:33:57.950 --> 00:33:57.960 align:start position:0%
record time is very exciting um I want
 
00:34:01.509 --> 00:34:01.519 align:start position:0%
to make one announcement uh before we
 
00:34:04.830 --> 00:34:04.840 align:start position:0%
all leave for the term as some of you
 
00:34:07.710 --> 00:34:07.720 align:start position:0%
know I am the representative from the
 
00:34:10.589 --> 00:34:10.599 align:start position:0%
house to the workers compensation
 
00:34:13.470 --> 00:34:13.480 align:start position:0%
advisory Council and one of the things
 
00:34:15.470 --> 00:34:15.480 align:start position:0%
that was discussed during our last
 
00:34:18.829 --> 00:34:18.839 align:start position:0%
meeting a couple weeks ago now is that
 
00:34:22.629 --> 00:34:22.639 align:start position:0%
the workers compensation rules are up
 
00:34:24.430 --> 00:34:24.440 align:start position:0%
for Renewal they they've hit their
 
00:34:27.869 --> 00:34:27.879 align:start position:0%
5-year period so the department is going
 
00:34:31.030 --> 00:34:31.040 align:start position:0%
to be working on those uh looking for
 
00:34:33.669 --> 00:34:33.679 align:start position:0%
things that need to be changed redraft
 
00:34:36.270 --> 00:34:36.280 align:start position:0%
them um it will then go through a
 
00:34:38.510 --> 00:34:38.520 align:start position:0%
process once once they come up with
 
00:34:40.990 --> 00:34:41.000 align:start position:0%
their draft but just a heads up for
 
00:34:43.990 --> 00:34:44.000 align:start position:0%
anyone here who might be interested in
 
00:34:47.270 --> 00:34:47.280 align:start position:0%
things um just a reminder that the rules
 
00:34:49.470 --> 00:34:49.480 align:start position:0%
are derived from
 
00:34:54.190 --> 00:34:54.200 align:start position:0%
our the laws that we pass so we haven't
 
00:34:56.790 --> 00:34:56.800 align:start position:0%
made any recent changes to workers comp
 
00:35:00.150 --> 00:35:00.160 align:start position:0%
so the department doesn't see anything
 
00:35:02.030 --> 00:35:02.040 align:start position:0%
major that they need to address but
 
00:35:04.109 --> 00:35:04.119 align:start position:0%
they're going to go through everything
 
00:35:07.750 --> 00:35:07.760 align:start position:0%
um and clean up any issues that they've
 
00:35:07.760 --> 00:35:09.870 align:start position:0%
um and clean up any issues that they've
seen

00:35:09.870 --> 00:35:09.880 align:start position:0%
seen
 
00:35:13.390 --> 00:35:13.400 align:start position:0%
um so with that it
 
00:35:16.069 --> 00:35:16.079 align:start position:0%
if nobody else has any other
 
00:35:18.230 --> 00:35:18.240 align:start position:0%
announcements or or business to bring
 
00:35:20.230 --> 00:35:20.240 align:start position:0%
forward I'm curious to see who's not
 
00:35:22.990 --> 00:35:23.000 align:start position:0%
running again just so we can say fa well
 
00:35:25.670 --> 00:35:25.680 align:start position:0%

00:35:28.790 --> 00:35:28.800 align:start position:0%
