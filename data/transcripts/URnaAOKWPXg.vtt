00:09:26.310 --> 00:09:26.320 align:start position:0%
is this a long
 
00:09:27.910 --> 00:09:27.920 align:start position:0%
thing on your
 
00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:29.430 align:start position:0%

00:09:39.990 --> 00:09:40.000 align:start position:0%
we'll start with item 7 the board of
 
00:09:45.269 --> 00:09:45.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:47.990 --> 00:09:48.000 align:start position:0%
mr chairman this is an emergency rule
 
00:09:50.870 --> 00:09:50.880 align:start position:0%
from the board of dental examiners
 
00:09:54.870 --> 00:09:54.880 align:start position:0%
what this rule does is currently by rule
 
00:09:57.509 --> 00:09:57.519 align:start position:0%
only 40 percent of
 
00:10:00.230 --> 00:10:00.240 align:start position:0%
continuing education units
 
00:10:02.710 --> 00:10:02.720 align:start position:0%
for dentists can be done by
 
00:10:05.910 --> 00:10:05.920 align:start position:0%
online by webinars
 
00:10:08.870 --> 00:10:08.880 align:start position:0%
given that there right now is
 
00:10:12.550 --> 00:10:12.560 align:start position:0%
very limited access to such in-person
 
00:10:15.670 --> 00:10:15.680 align:start position:0%
seminars to live seminars
 
00:10:18.389 --> 00:10:18.399 align:start position:0%
the board is put forth this emergency
 
00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:21.360 align:start position:0%
rule that would for 180 days
 
00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:22.310 align:start position:0%
rule that would for 180 days
allow

00:10:22.310 --> 00:10:22.320 align:start position:0%
allow
 
00:10:26.470 --> 00:10:26.480 align:start position:0%
100 percent online women live webinars
 
00:10:28.949 --> 00:10:28.959 align:start position:0%
to be used for credits the concern is
 
00:10:30.710 --> 00:10:30.720 align:start position:0%
that dentists are not going to be able
 
00:10:32.949 --> 00:10:32.959 align:start position:0%
to meet their requirements
 
00:10:34.870 --> 00:10:34.880 align:start position:0%
to renew their licenses
 
00:10:36.790 --> 00:10:36.800 align:start position:0%
and it's going to reduce the number of
 
00:10:38.710 --> 00:10:38.720 align:start position:0%
dentists available
 
00:10:40.790 --> 00:10:40.800 align:start position:0%
plus cause economic harm to those
 
00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:43.269 align:start position:0%
plus cause economic harm to those
dentists

00:10:43.269 --> 00:10:43.279 align:start position:0%
dentists
 
00:10:44.870 --> 00:10:44.880 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
00:10:46.790 --> 00:10:46.800 align:start position:0%
there was a similar rule by one of the
 
00:10:54.710 --> 00:10:54.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:56.470 --> 00:10:56.480 align:start position:0%
any discussion
 
00:11:05.829 --> 00:11:05.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:08.389 --> 00:11:08.399 align:start position:0%
i don't believe so they had asked staff
 
00:11:15.750 --> 00:11:15.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:18.230 --> 00:11:18.240 align:start position:0%
good morning i'm tina kelly i'm here to
 
00:11:20.710 --> 00:11:20.720 align:start position:0%
represent the board of dental examiners
 
00:11:21.750 --> 00:11:21.760 align:start position:0%

program specialist with oplc and i'll be
 
00:11:25.670 --> 00:11:25.680 align:start position:0%
glad to ask any ques answer any
 
00:11:27.670 --> 00:11:27.680 align:start position:0%
questions you might have
 
00:11:30.389 --> 00:11:30.399 align:start position:0%
can we expect this situation to be
 
00:11:34.150 --> 00:11:34.160 align:start position:0%
corrected in the near future
 
00:11:36.150 --> 00:11:36.160 align:start position:0%
it's anticipated this this will be the
 
00:11:37.990 --> 00:11:38.000 align:start position:0%
only time this emergency role will be
 
00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:38.870 align:start position:0%
only time this emergency role will be
needed

00:11:38.870 --> 00:11:38.880 align:start position:0%
needed
 
00:11:41.670 --> 00:11:41.680 align:start position:0%
at the present time they're not doing
 
00:11:43.590 --> 00:11:43.600 align:start position:0%
live courses but they will be going back
 
00:11:46.710 --> 00:11:46.720 align:start position:0%
to those so i anticipate that this will
 
00:11:49.190 --> 00:11:49.200 align:start position:0%
rectify them rectify itself
 
00:11:51.990 --> 00:11:52.000 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:53.350 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
yes

00:11:53.350 --> 00:11:53.360 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:54.949 align:start position:0%
yes
yes

00:11:54.949 --> 00:11:54.959 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:11:56.710 --> 00:11:56.720 align:start position:0%
i just have a quick question i don't
 
00:12:01.509 --> 00:12:01.519 align:start position:0%
know if miss kelly knows but proximantis
 
00:12:05.350 --> 00:12:05.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:07.269 --> 00:12:07.279 align:start position:0%
this would probably and i don't know the
 
00:12:09.030 --> 00:12:09.040 align:start position:0%
number of dentists there are licensed in
 
00:12:11.590 --> 00:12:11.600 align:start position:0%
the state but it is my anticipation that
 
00:12:13.910 --> 00:12:13.920 align:start position:0%
this changing this rule or not changing
 
00:12:16.230 --> 00:12:16.240 align:start position:0%
this rule would affect all the dentists
 
00:12:17.670 --> 00:12:17.680 align:start position:0%
because they have to get a certain
 
00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:18.870 align:start position:0%
because they have to get a certain
number

00:12:18.870 --> 00:12:18.880 align:start position:0%
number
 
00:12:22.710 --> 00:12:22.720 align:start position:0%
through live courses thank you
 
00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:26.949 align:start position:0%
through live courses thank you

and um the committee staff no longer
 
00:13:47.189 --> 00:13:47.199 align:start position:0%
have any comments the the agency did a
 
00:13:48.629 --> 00:13:48.639 align:start position:0%
great job of
 
00:13:51.430 --> 00:13:51.440 align:start position:0%
eliminating the unclear comments with
 
00:13:54.150 --> 00:13:54.160 align:start position:0%
the forms from previously i just have a
 
00:13:56.710 --> 00:13:56.720 align:start position:0%
note to gelcar because originally there
 
00:13:58.310 --> 00:13:58.320 align:start position:0%
was an inadequate
 
00:14:00.230 --> 00:14:00.240 align:start position:0%
fiscal impact statement
 
00:14:03.189 --> 00:14:03.199 align:start position:0%
this was because in between the ip and
 
00:14:04.389 --> 00:14:04.399 align:start position:0%
the fp
 
00:14:08.230 --> 00:14:08.240 align:start position:0%
the um fees for these licenses changed
 
00:14:10.150 --> 00:14:10.160 align:start position:0%
and there wasn't an updated fiscal
 
00:14:12.150 --> 00:14:12.160 align:start position:0%
impact statement there is now and that
 
00:14:14.629 --> 00:14:14.639 align:start position:0%
is attached in your packet so um
 
00:14:16.389 --> 00:14:16.399 align:start position:0%
everything has been
 
00:14:18.069 --> 00:14:18.079 align:start position:0%
or all concerns of committee staff have
 
00:14:21.590 --> 00:14:21.600 align:start position:0%

00:14:37.199 --> 00:14:40.310 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:14:40.310 --> 00:14:40.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:43.670 --> 00:14:43.680 align:start position:0%

comments

00:14:55.110 --> 00:14:55.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:56.629 --> 00:14:56.639 align:start position:0%
i think it's it's on the agenda because
 
00:14:59.509 --> 00:14:59.519 align:start position:0%
we were anticipating
 
00:15:01.750 --> 00:15:01.760 align:start position:0%
public testimony
 
00:15:03.829 --> 00:15:03.839 align:start position:0%
one section of the rule deals with
 
00:15:06.069 --> 00:15:06.079 align:start position:0%
remote education there's a general
 
00:15:08.949 --> 00:15:08.959 align:start position:0%
prohibition with some limited exceptions
 
00:15:11.030 --> 00:15:11.040 align:start position:0%
and we didn't know if that would cause
 
00:15:13.189 --> 00:15:13.199 align:start position:0%
any public testimony or not
 
00:15:14.310 --> 00:15:14.320 align:start position:0%
otherwise it would have been on the
 
00:15:16.150 --> 00:15:16.160 align:start position:0%
consent item

mr chairman before we start to discuss
 
00:16:01.670 --> 00:16:01.680 align:start position:0%
this rule we need to take a preliminary
 
00:16:04.069 --> 00:16:04.079 align:start position:0%
procedural vote
 
00:16:04.079 --> 00:16:05.269 align:start position:0%
procedural vote
when

00:16:05.269 --> 00:16:05.279 align:start position:0%
when
 
00:16:07.110 --> 00:16:07.120 align:start position:0%
our office received the conditional
 
00:16:08.550 --> 00:16:08.560 align:start position:0%
approval request
 
00:16:11.189 --> 00:16:11.199 align:start position:0%
it was less than the seven day
 
00:16:13.509 --> 00:16:13.519 align:start position:0%
required by statute
 
00:16:15.910 --> 00:16:15.920 align:start position:0%
in that instance the department can
 
00:16:17.990 --> 00:16:18.000 align:start position:0%
request the committee to still take up
 
00:16:20.230 --> 00:16:20.240 align:start position:0%
the conditional approval response
 
00:16:22.470 --> 00:16:22.480 align:start position:0%
and i have to say it was by no fault of
 
00:16:24.310 --> 00:16:24.320 align:start position:0%
the department that the conditional
 
00:16:26.069 --> 00:16:26.079 align:start position:0%
approval was late
 
00:16:27.910 --> 00:16:27.920 align:start position:0%
they received our final proposal
 
00:16:30.550 --> 00:16:30.560 align:start position:0%
comments quite late and simply did not
 
00:16:32.790 --> 00:16:32.800 align:start position:0%
have the time to fashion a conditional
 
00:16:35.110 --> 00:16:35.120 align:start position:0%
approval response before the seven day
 
00:16:38.150 --> 00:16:38.160 align:start position:0%
limit passed okay we need a motion to
 
00:16:39.829 --> 00:16:39.839 align:start position:0%

we don't have a specific concern with

the language of
 
00:18:49.750 --> 00:18:49.760 align:start position:0%
this paragraph it just we felt was the
 
00:18:51.430 --> 00:18:51.440 align:start position:0%
appropriate place to
 
00:18:53.350 --> 00:18:53.360 align:start position:0%
put the comment below
 
00:18:54.830 --> 00:18:54.840 align:start position:0%
which was a

f2 2 lists
 
00:19:10.549 --> 00:19:10.559 align:start position:0%
the items that can be educational

scholarship organization
 
00:19:17.590 --> 00:19:17.600 align:start position:0%
the paragraph o is a catch-all that says
 
00:19:19.990 --> 00:19:20.000 align:start position:0%
any other educational expense approved
 
00:19:23.110 --> 00:19:23.120 align:start position:0%
by the scholarship organization
 
00:19:25.270 --> 00:19:25.280 align:start position:0%
we're concerned that a lack of criteria
 
00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:26.150 align:start position:0%
we're concerned that a lack of criteria
here

00:19:26.150 --> 00:19:26.160 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:19:27.669 --> 00:19:27.679 align:start position:0%
would allow
 
00:19:31.750 --> 00:19:31.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:34.150 --> 00:19:34.160 align:start position:0%
scholarship organization to approve or
 
00:19:38.789 --> 00:19:38.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:40.070 --> 00:19:40.080 align:start position:0%
the board
 
00:19:42.070 --> 00:19:42.080 align:start position:0%
the department's position is that you
 
00:19:45.029 --> 00:19:45.039 align:start position:0%
know this is legislative intent this
 
00:19:47.190 --> 00:19:47.200 align:start position:0%
statute authorizes the scholarship
 
00:19:49.190 --> 00:19:49.200 align:start position:0%
organization to do this
 
00:19:51.750 --> 00:19:51.760 align:start position:0%
but we're concerned that
 
00:19:54.310 --> 00:19:54.320 align:start position:0%
the scholarship organization is actually
 
00:19:56.470 --> 00:19:56.480 align:start position:0%
a vendor for the state
 
00:19:57.909 --> 00:19:57.919 align:start position:0%
and is
 
00:20:00.470 --> 00:20:00.480 align:start position:0%
spending state money without
 
00:20:01.990 --> 00:20:02.000 align:start position:0%
adequate direction
 
00:20:04.310 --> 00:20:04.320 align:start position:0%
there is no criteria about
 
00:20:08.310 --> 00:20:08.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:10.149 --> 00:20:10.159 align:start position:0%
i presume the committee would like
 
00:20:13.270 --> 00:20:13.280 align:start position:0%
us to take these one at a time
 
00:20:20.230 --> 00:20:20.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:22.310 --> 00:20:22.320 align:start position:0%
great thank you for that um so one
 
00:20:24.789 --> 00:20:24.799 align:start position:0%
clarification um so
 
00:20:26.870 --> 00:20:26.880 align:start position:0%
as the comment was summarized there's an
 
00:20:28.789 --> 00:20:28.799 align:start position:0%
indication that there is no criteria for
 
00:20:30.470 --> 00:20:30.480 align:start position:0%
the scholarship organization to be able
 
00:20:32.710 --> 00:20:32.720 align:start position:0%
to adjudicate whether or not a
 
00:20:34.310 --> 00:20:34.320 align:start position:0%
expense through the education freedom
 
00:20:36.549 --> 00:20:36.559 align:start position:0%
account is eligible or not and we would
 
00:20:38.549 --> 00:20:38.559 align:start position:0%
assert that there is criteria in the
 
00:20:40.070 --> 00:20:40.080 align:start position:0%
statute as it was crafted by the
 
00:20:42.710 --> 00:20:42.720 align:start position:0%
legislature and that comes across in a
 
00:20:44.390 --> 00:20:44.400 align:start position:0%
couple of different ways
 
00:20:47.510 --> 00:20:47.520 align:start position:0%
first there is an enumerated list
 
00:20:51.190 --> 00:20:51.200 align:start position:0%
of expenses it's a through o o being the
 
00:20:53.750 --> 00:20:53.760 align:start position:0%
last item and if you see in our response
 
00:20:55.270 --> 00:20:55.280 align:start position:0%
we've quoted
 
00:20:57.590 --> 00:20:57.600 align:start position:0%
some case law on this that
 
00:20:59.830 --> 00:20:59.840 align:start position:0%
o can't be taken out of the context of
 
00:21:01.750 --> 00:21:01.760 align:start position:0%
being part of a list and say like when
 
00:21:03.830 --> 00:21:03.840 align:start position:0%
it says any other eligible expenses it
 
00:21:05.110 --> 00:21:05.120 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean they can just or any other
 
00:21:06.390 --> 00:21:06.400 align:start position:0%
expenses they can just go out and spend
 
00:21:08.710 --> 00:21:08.720 align:start position:0%
it on anything they want they have to be
 
00:21:11.270 --> 00:21:11.280 align:start position:0%
in the context of that list
 
00:21:13.990 --> 00:21:14.000 align:start position:0%
and then if you go and you look at um
 
00:21:15.750 --> 00:21:15.760 align:start position:0%
you know the reference in
 
00:21:17.909 --> 00:21:17.919 align:start position:0%
194 f22
 
00:21:21.590 --> 00:21:21.600 align:start position:0%
it is enumerated in their what are types
 
00:21:23.270 --> 00:21:23.280 align:start position:0%
of eligible expenses what are we
 
00:21:24.630 --> 00:21:24.640 align:start position:0%
supposed to be spending it says to
 
00:21:26.230 --> 00:21:26.240 align:start position:0%
provide an education for an eligible
 
00:21:27.990 --> 00:21:28.000 align:start position:0%
student in the core knowledge domains
 
00:21:29.350 --> 00:21:29.360 align:start position:0%
that include science mathematics
 
00:21:30.950 --> 00:21:30.960 align:start position:0%
language government history health
 
00:21:34.149 --> 00:21:34.159 align:start position:0%
readings uh writing spelling uh history
 
00:21:35.590 --> 00:21:35.600 align:start position:0%
of the constitutions of new hampshire in
 
00:21:37.029 --> 00:21:37.039 align:start position:0%
the united states and exposure to
 
00:21:38.950 --> 00:21:38.960 align:start position:0%
appreciation of the arts and music so
 
00:21:40.789 --> 00:21:40.799 align:start position:0%
for example if a particular student said
 
00:21:42.870 --> 00:21:42.880 align:start position:0%
well i want to spend money on how to
 
00:21:44.710 --> 00:21:44.720 align:start position:0%
become an airline pilot well i don't see
 
00:21:46.630 --> 00:21:46.640 align:start position:0%
that fitting into these categories here
 
00:21:48.950 --> 00:21:48.960 align:start position:0%
so we think that there is appropriate
 
00:21:51.110 --> 00:21:51.120 align:start position:0%
constraining language
 
00:21:51.120 --> 00:21:52.149 align:start position:0%
constraining language
for

00:21:52.149 --> 00:21:52.159 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:21:54.390 --> 00:21:54.400 align:start position:0%
the scholarship organization to be able
 
00:21:57.990 --> 00:21:58.000 align:start position:0%
to have criteria to apply this as we go
 
00:22:00.149 --> 00:22:00.159 align:start position:0%
forward and then the final point that i
 
00:22:02.230 --> 00:22:02.240 align:start position:0%
will make is that the department also
 
00:22:04.149 --> 00:22:04.159 align:start position:0%
has a programmatic monitoring so we will
 
00:22:07.110 --> 00:22:07.120 align:start position:0%
be reviewing expenses at the back end of
 
00:22:09.110 --> 00:22:09.120 align:start position:0%
this and auditing to make sure that they
 
00:22:11.430 --> 00:22:11.440 align:start position:0%
are eligible expenses so i believe that
 
00:22:14.070 --> 00:22:14.080 align:start position:0%
there are plenty of constraints in place
 
00:22:15.350 --> 00:22:15.360 align:start position:0%
and that
 
00:22:16.870 --> 00:22:16.880 align:start position:0%
you know the legislature by creating
 
00:22:19.669 --> 00:22:19.679 align:start position:0%
that o category is acknowledging that
 
00:22:21.830 --> 00:22:21.840 align:start position:0%
it's not possible to enumerate every
 
00:22:24.630 --> 00:22:24.640 align:start position:0%
expense that some student may use
 
00:22:27.510 --> 00:22:27.520 align:start position:0%
eligibly on educational expenses so
 
00:22:29.990 --> 00:22:30.000 align:start position:0%
there's this catch-all rather than us
 
00:22:31.350 --> 00:22:31.360 align:start position:0%
trying to enumerate it and i don't
 
00:22:33.350 --> 00:22:33.360 align:start position:0%
believe it was the legislature's intent
 
00:22:36.630 --> 00:22:36.640 align:start position:0%
for an agency to narrow down what those
 
00:22:39.430 --> 00:22:39.440 align:start position:0%
expenses might be by us coming up with
 
00:22:41.270 --> 00:22:41.280 align:start position:0%
our own determination of what other
 
00:22:44.789 --> 00:22:44.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:50.149 --> 00:22:50.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:53.669 --> 00:22:53.679 align:start position:0%
so is is the middle ground
 
00:22:56.230 --> 00:22:56.240 align:start position:0%
adding to the sentence
 
00:22:57.270 --> 00:22:57.280 align:start position:0%
some of the
 
00:23:00.149 --> 00:23:00.159 align:start position:0%
items that the commissioner uh suggested
 
00:23:02.549 --> 00:23:02.559 align:start position:0%
in there and giving other expenses
 
00:23:05.270 --> 00:23:05.280 align:start position:0%
consistent with and then adding
 
00:23:06.390 --> 00:23:06.400 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:23:08.710 --> 00:23:08.720 align:start position:0%
at least a brief or or a reference to
 
00:23:10.390 --> 00:23:10.400 align:start position:0%
the language
 
00:23:12.710 --> 00:23:12.720 align:start position:0%
well so we would assert that that
 
00:23:14.310 --> 00:23:14.320 align:start position:0%
broader language is already part of i
 
00:23:16.149 --> 00:23:16.159 align:start position:0%
mean again it's got a long list of
 
00:23:17.830 --> 00:23:17.840 align:start position:0%
expenses to begin with it starts a day
 
00:23:19.669 --> 00:23:19.679 align:start position:0%
and goes all the way through a so it's
 
00:23:21.430 --> 00:23:21.440 align:start position:0%
defining a lot of different types of
 
00:23:24.950 --> 00:23:24.960 align:start position:0%
expenses that are eligible so us trying
 
00:23:27.590 --> 00:23:27.600 align:start position:0%
to add to a list that goes from a
 
00:23:29.669 --> 00:23:29.679 align:start position:0%
you know through o already i don't think
 
00:23:31.750 --> 00:23:31.760 align:start position:0%
is going to add clarity
 
00:23:33.350 --> 00:23:33.360 align:start position:0%
what we really need to understand is
 
00:23:33.360 --> 00:23:34.230 align:start position:0%
what we really need to understand is
that

00:23:34.230 --> 00:23:34.240 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:23:35.830 --> 00:23:35.840 align:start position:0%
they have to be educate you know
 
00:23:38.470 --> 00:23:38.480 align:start position:0%
eligible education expenses but i'm not
 
00:23:40.470 --> 00:23:40.480 align:start position:0%
sure and then is your question that we
 
00:23:42.310 --> 00:23:42.320 align:start position:0%
should should put a negation here's
 
00:23:44.230 --> 00:23:44.240 align:start position:0%
what's not allowed
 
00:23:47.430 --> 00:23:47.440 align:start position:0%
if i mean mr chair
 
00:23:49.750 --> 00:23:49.760 align:start position:0%
you read a statement that the education
 
00:23:52.230 --> 00:23:52.240 align:start position:0%
expenses should be consistent with
 
00:23:54.070 --> 00:23:54.080 align:start position:0%
and then you've read the statement yep i
 
00:23:55.590 --> 00:23:55.600 align:start position:0%
said i read the law
 
00:23:58.390 --> 00:23:58.400 align:start position:0%
what i'm suggesting is that instead of
 
00:24:00.630 --> 00:24:00.640 align:start position:0%
just say other expenses that say other
 
00:24:03.029 --> 00:24:03.039 align:start position:0%
expenses consistent with
 
00:24:05.110 --> 00:24:05.120 align:start position:0%
and then put that statement that you
 
00:24:06.789 --> 00:24:06.799 align:start position:0%
read either in
 
00:24:09.590 --> 00:24:09.600 align:start position:0%
you know the words in or put a reference
 
00:24:10.950 --> 00:24:10.960 align:start position:0%
to it in
 
00:24:13.750 --> 00:24:13.760 align:start position:0%
and therefore you get what you want
 
00:24:16.630 --> 00:24:16.640 align:start position:0%
he gets what he wants and we've crafted
 
00:24:18.710 --> 00:24:18.720 align:start position:0%
that win-win that we're always seeking
 
00:24:21.269 --> 00:24:21.279 align:start position:0%
right yeah um so i mean you know
 
00:24:23.590 --> 00:24:23.600 align:start position:0%
certainly delcar can do what they want
 
00:24:25.029 --> 00:24:25.039 align:start position:0%
if they think that's necessary i think
 
00:24:27.269 --> 00:24:27.279 align:start position:0%
that that's already clear in the statute
 
00:24:29.510 --> 00:24:29.520 align:start position:0%
and in the law we would basically what
 
00:24:31.750 --> 00:24:31.760 align:start position:0%
would be happening is we would take rsa
 
00:24:34.390 --> 00:24:34.400 align:start position:0%
192 f2 2
 
00:24:38.710 --> 00:24:38.720 align:start position:0%
and restate the exact same language into
 
00:24:42.390 --> 00:24:42.400 align:start position:0%
uh rsa 192 f22o so in other words like
 
00:24:44.470 --> 00:24:44.480 align:start position:0%
so it's already in its contact site it
 
00:24:46.149 --> 00:24:46.159 align:start position:0%
says here's the introductory here's the
 
00:24:47.830 --> 00:24:47.840 align:start position:0%
broad categories of expenses and then
 
00:24:49.990 --> 00:24:50.000 align:start position:0%
you've got enumerated lists of expenses
 
00:24:51.830 --> 00:24:51.840 align:start position:0%
and so we would just take that paragraph
 
00:24:54.149 --> 00:24:54.159 align:start position:0%
and reiterate the exact same paragraph
 
00:24:56.710 --> 00:24:56.720 align:start position:0%
over again um so i'm not sure that that
 
00:24:58.630 --> 00:24:58.640 align:start position:0%
it adds clarity per se
 
00:25:01.350 --> 00:25:01.360 align:start position:0%
representative mcguire thank you
 
00:25:03.190 --> 00:25:03.200 align:start position:0%
mr chair i don't think this is the right
 
00:25:05.669 --> 00:25:05.679 align:start position:0%
place to put it in any case because this
 
00:25:05.679 --> 00:25:07.029 align:start position:0%
place to put it in any case because this
paragraph

00:25:07.029 --> 00:25:07.039 align:start position:0%
paragraph
 
00:25:09.430 --> 00:25:09.440 align:start position:0%
i is dealing with the
 
00:25:12.070 --> 00:25:12.080 align:start position:0%
parent and education server provider
 
00:25:14.870 --> 00:25:14.880 align:start position:0%
advisory commission which is responsible
 
00:25:16.310 --> 00:25:16.320 align:start position:0%
for appeals
 
00:25:20.070 --> 00:25:20.080 align:start position:0%
for denials and other expenses so
 
00:25:22.149 --> 00:25:22.159 align:start position:0%
as long as there is anything that is not
 
00:25:25.029 --> 00:25:25.039 align:start position:0%
specifically enumerated this paragraph
 
00:25:28.470 --> 00:25:28.480 align:start position:0%
says there is a advisory commission
 
00:25:31.430 --> 00:25:31.440 align:start position:0%
set up set up in statute which
 
00:25:34.870 --> 00:25:34.880 align:start position:0%
deals with appeals and whether other
 
00:25:37.350 --> 00:25:37.360 align:start position:0%
expenses are appropriate
 
00:25:39.750 --> 00:25:39.760 align:start position:0%
so i think we don't need to say
 
00:25:39.760 --> 00:25:40.710 align:start position:0%
so i think we don't need to say
here

00:25:40.710 --> 00:25:40.720 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:25:42.470 --> 00:25:42.480 align:start position:0%
that they have to be in accordance with
 
00:25:42.480 --> 00:25:46.870 align:start position:0%
that they have to be in accordance with
anything

00:25:46.870 --> 00:25:46.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:49.350 --> 00:25:49.360 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you mr chair
 
00:25:50.950 --> 00:25:50.960 align:start position:0%
perhaps uh we could do it a little
 
00:25:52.630 --> 00:25:52.640 align:start position:0%
different we could you know instead of
 
00:25:54.390 --> 00:25:54.400 align:start position:0%
enumerating everything in the rule we
 
00:25:56.789 --> 00:25:56.799 align:start position:0%
could just say something like um you
 
00:25:58.789 --> 00:25:58.799 align:start position:0%
know that the expenses are limited to
 
00:26:00.870 --> 00:26:00.880 align:start position:0%
those areas specifically in the statute
 
00:26:02.149 --> 00:26:02.159 align:start position:0%
and then inside the statute would you
 
00:26:04.950 --> 00:26:04.960 align:start position:0%
would you object to that
 
00:26:07.110 --> 00:26:07.120 align:start position:0%
i i don't have an objection to that
 
00:26:09.190 --> 00:26:09.200 align:start position:0%
because again you all can do
 
00:26:11.269 --> 00:26:11.279 align:start position:0%
as you see fit but i think that
 
00:26:13.669 --> 00:26:13.679 align:start position:0%
that's already in the statute it says
 
00:26:15.269 --> 00:26:15.279 align:start position:0%
that these are the only things that you
 
00:26:17.669 --> 00:26:17.679 align:start position:0%
can do with it and so we're reiterating
 
00:26:19.190 --> 00:26:19.200 align:start position:0%
that's not my question so the reference
 
00:26:21.430 --> 00:26:21.440 align:start position:0%
would be
 
00:26:23.110 --> 00:26:23.120 align:start position:0%
you know that the expenses are limited
 
00:26:25.350 --> 00:26:25.360 align:start position:0%
to those in the statute so it's a
 
00:26:27.430 --> 00:26:27.440 align:start position:0%
limitation to what's in what you're just
 
00:26:29.110 --> 00:26:29.120 align:start position:0%
saying what's listed in the statute yeah
 
00:26:30.789 --> 00:26:30.799 align:start position:0%
so i think we already have that language
 
00:26:32.230 --> 00:26:32.240 align:start position:0%
in there that we're saying you can only
 
00:26:34.789 --> 00:26:34.799 align:start position:0%
spend it on these eligible expenses so
 
00:26:36.549 --> 00:26:36.559 align:start position:0%
we are saying that i think that you
 
00:26:37.669 --> 00:26:37.679 align:start position:0%
wouldn't object that putting that into
 
00:26:39.190 --> 00:26:39.200 align:start position:0%
the rule then
 
00:26:40.950 --> 00:26:40.960 align:start position:0%
i think it's already in the role
 
00:26:42.870 --> 00:26:42.880 align:start position:0%
and i disagree okay
 
00:26:44.630 --> 00:26:44.640 align:start position:0%
it's not in this location it may be
 
00:26:47.350 --> 00:26:47.360 align:start position:0%
somewhere else senator
 
00:26:47.360 --> 00:26:48.470 align:start position:0%
somewhere else senator
mike

00:26:48.470 --> 00:26:48.480 align:start position:0%
mike
 
00:26:50.950 --> 00:26:50.960 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure that that senator whitley's
 
00:26:53.669 --> 00:26:53.679 align:start position:0%
suggestion would clarify the problem
 
00:26:55.430 --> 00:26:55.440 align:start position:0%
because if you just require compliance
 
00:26:58.310 --> 00:26:58.320 align:start position:0%
with the statute well o in the statute
 
00:27:01.350 --> 00:27:01.360 align:start position:0%
has that catch-all that's very broad i
 
00:27:04.310 --> 00:27:04.320 align:start position:0%
mean the purpose of rules is to clarify
 
00:27:07.430 --> 00:27:07.440 align:start position:0%
and implement statute
 
00:27:10.549 --> 00:27:10.559 align:start position:0%
so that catch-all in the statute
 
00:27:12.149 --> 00:27:12.159 align:start position:0%
hopefully would be fleshed out in the
 
00:27:14.390 --> 00:27:14.400 align:start position:0%
rule i think senator gray had a pretty
 
00:27:16.630 --> 00:27:16.640 align:start position:0%
good suggestion i'm not sure exactly
 
00:27:18.870 --> 00:27:18.880 align:start position:0%
where it would go in the rules but to
 
00:27:21.510 --> 00:27:21.520 align:start position:0%
say uh for the catch all in the rule to
 
00:27:23.590 --> 00:27:23.600 align:start position:0%
say consistent with the
 
00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:24.870 align:start position:0%
say consistent with the
items

00:27:24.870 --> 00:27:24.880 align:start position:0%
items
 
00:27:26.789 --> 00:27:26.799 align:start position:0%
listed in a
 
00:27:29.110 --> 00:27:29.120 align:start position:0%
above perhaps you should we should look
 
00:27:33.269 --> 00:27:33.279 align:start position:0%
at on page 11 qualifying efa expenses
 
00:27:36.149 --> 00:27:36.159 align:start position:0%
where it limits some of the items
 
00:27:38.230 --> 00:27:38.240 align:start position:0%
and it goes on to say
 
00:27:40.149 --> 00:27:40.159 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:27:42.389 --> 00:27:42.399 align:start position:0%
d under there which is at the top of
 
00:27:45.350 --> 00:27:45.360 align:start position:0%
page 12 says a scholarship organization
 
00:27:47.750 --> 00:27:47.760 align:start position:0%
shall publish on its website a policy
 
00:27:49.590 --> 00:27:49.600 align:start position:0%
for pre-approval of qualifying
 
00:27:53.190 --> 00:27:53.200 align:start position:0%
educational expenses consistent with
 
00:27:53.200 --> 00:27:55.269 align:start position:0%
educational expenses consistent with
f2

00:27:55.269 --> 00:27:55.279 align:start position:0%
f2
 
00:27:57.909 --> 00:27:57.919 align:start position:0%
oh and this section so that they would
 
00:27:59.830 --> 00:27:59.840 align:start position:0%
list out
 
00:28:01.830 --> 00:28:01.840 align:start position:0%
once people identify
 
00:28:04.789 --> 00:28:04.799 align:start position:0%
other expen other qualifying expenses
 
00:28:07.990 --> 00:28:08.000 align:start position:0%
they list them and say this is not
 
00:28:09.909 --> 00:28:09.919 align:start position:0%
specifically enumerated but it's
 
00:28:09.919 --> 00:28:12.710 align:start position:0%
specifically enumerated but it's
appropriate

00:28:12.710 --> 00:28:12.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:14.230 --> 00:28:14.240 align:start position:0%
so so i think i agree with the
 
00:28:17.590 --> 00:28:17.600 align:start position:0%
commissioner that it's already there
 
00:28:19.029 --> 00:28:19.039 align:start position:0%
so just reflecting that's what i'm
 
00:28:20.789 --> 00:28:20.799 align:start position:0%
saying is like i feel like we've already
 
00:28:22.549 --> 00:28:22.559 align:start position:0%
pulled that into here and so you can
 
00:28:26.149 --> 00:28:26.159 align:start position:0%
only do the things that are enumerated
 
00:28:27.909 --> 00:28:27.919 align:start position:0%
i also just wanted to point out um ols
 
00:28:31.269 --> 00:28:31.279 align:start position:0%
staff noted that the um the state is in
 
00:28:32.950 --> 00:28:32.960 align:start position:0%
contractual privity with the scholarship
 
00:28:34.789 --> 00:28:34.799 align:start position:0%
organization so we do the department
 
00:28:37.590 --> 00:28:37.600 align:start position:0%
does have oversight through its contract
 
00:28:40.149 --> 00:28:40.159 align:start position:0%
and um you know agencies don't manage
 
00:28:41.590 --> 00:28:41.600 align:start position:0%
their contracts through administrative
 
00:28:43.750 --> 00:28:43.760 align:start position:0%
rules so
 
00:28:46.389 --> 00:28:46.399 align:start position:0%
scholarship organization is in constant
 
00:28:47.990 --> 00:28:48.000 align:start position:0%
contact with the department over issues
 
00:28:49.909 --> 00:28:49.919 align:start position:0%
like this and it is the department's
 
00:28:51.750 --> 00:28:51.760 align:start position:0%
understanding that the
 
00:28:53.110 --> 00:28:53.120 align:start position:0%
uh the
 
00:28:55.590 --> 00:28:55.600 align:start position:0%
the list is limited that the catch-all i
 
00:28:56.870 --> 00:28:56.880 align:start position:0%
mean the department's understanding is
 
00:28:59.510 --> 00:28:59.520 align:start position:0%
that the as the commissioner said
 
00:28:59.520 --> 00:29:01.350 align:start position:0%
that the as the commissioner said
the

00:29:01.350 --> 00:29:01.360 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:29:03.830 --> 00:29:03.840 align:start position:0%
uh the legislature
 
00:29:05.190 --> 00:29:05.200 align:start position:0%
believed that there were it was
 
00:29:07.350 --> 00:29:07.360 align:start position:0%
impossible to enumerate every
 
00:29:07.360 --> 00:29:08.710 align:start position:0%
impossible to enumerate every
conceivable

00:29:08.710 --> 00:29:08.720 align:start position:0%
conceivable
 
00:29:10.710 --> 00:29:10.720 align:start position:0%
uh educational expense that could be
 
00:29:13.110 --> 00:29:13.120 align:start position:0%
consistent with the the core uh
 
00:29:15.029 --> 00:29:15.039 align:start position:0%
provisions that are set forth and the
 
00:29:16.549 --> 00:29:16.559 align:start position:0%
department would have the same problem
 
00:29:19.350 --> 00:29:19.360 align:start position:0%
in limiting it there's a there's a
 
00:29:21.750 --> 00:29:21.760 align:start position:0%
essential case-by-case nature of looking
 
00:29:24.070 --> 00:29:24.080 align:start position:0%
at a lot of these and the department
 
00:29:25.430 --> 00:29:25.440 align:start position:0%
thinks it would be contrary to the
 
00:29:27.669 --> 00:29:27.679 align:start position:0%
legislative intent to somehow limit that
 
00:29:31.029 --> 00:29:31.039 align:start position:0%
by uh constraining it but we we do have
 
00:29:32.470 --> 00:29:32.480 align:start position:0%
this contractual privity and the
 
00:29:33.830 --> 00:29:33.840 align:start position:0%
relationship with the scholarship
 
00:29:37.110 --> 00:29:37.120 align:start position:0%
organization um so that the department's
 
00:29:39.669 --> 00:29:39.679 align:start position:0%
understanding here will effectively be
 
00:29:41.110 --> 00:29:41.120 align:start position:0%
the way the scholarship organization
 
00:29:45.909 --> 00:29:45.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:47.830 --> 00:29:47.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
00:29:49.269 --> 00:29:49.279 align:start position:0%
so i understand that you know there's
 
00:29:51.350 --> 00:29:51.360 align:start position:0%
that contractual relationship with the
 
00:29:53.269 --> 00:29:53.279 align:start position:0%
department and
 
00:29:55.430 --> 00:29:55.440 align:start position:0%
a scholarship organization but would you
 
00:29:57.190 --> 00:29:57.200 align:start position:0%
agree that you know the legislature has
 
00:29:59.350 --> 00:29:59.360 align:start position:0%
a very important role and gialcar is a
 
00:30:01.029 --> 00:30:01.039 align:start position:0%
very important role in
 
00:30:02.870 --> 00:30:02.880 align:start position:0%
understanding how public funds are going
 
00:30:04.230 --> 00:30:04.240 align:start position:0%
to be
 
00:30:07.990 --> 00:30:08.000 align:start position:0%
spent and i'm particularly uncomfortable
 
00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:08.710 align:start position:0%
spent and i'm particularly uncomfortable
with

00:30:08.710 --> 00:30:08.720 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:30:10.950 --> 00:30:10.960 align:start position:0%
such a broad catch-all that we would
 
00:30:12.789 --> 00:30:12.799 align:start position:0%
have that were writing a blank check
 
00:30:14.549 --> 00:30:14.559 align:start position:0%
essentially wouldn't you agree that the
 
00:30:16.310 --> 00:30:16.320 align:start position:0%
legislature has an important role in
 
00:30:18.310 --> 00:30:18.320 align:start position:0%
managing public funds
 
00:30:20.789 --> 00:30:20.799 align:start position:0%
i would emphasize that the legislature
 
00:30:23.750 --> 00:30:23.760 align:start position:0%
has the premier role in educating
 
00:30:26.070 --> 00:30:26.080 align:start position:0%
managing those funds and our role is to
 
00:30:28.070 --> 00:30:28.080 align:start position:0%
administer the laws that you've given us
 
00:30:30.310 --> 00:30:30.320 align:start position:0%
so there is that category oh that says
 
00:30:32.470 --> 00:30:32.480 align:start position:0%
other educational expenses because the
 
00:30:32.480 --> 00:30:34.070 align:start position:0%
other educational expenses because the
legislature

00:30:34.070 --> 00:30:34.080 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
00:30:36.149 --> 00:30:36.159 align:start position:0%
it appears determined that there's this
 
00:30:38.310 --> 00:30:38.320 align:start position:0%
long list of a through o
 
00:30:40.310 --> 00:30:40.320 align:start position:0%
o being we don't know what else might
 
00:30:42.149 --> 00:30:42.159 align:start position:0%
come up but it has to fit into the
 
00:30:43.830 --> 00:30:43.840 align:start position:0%
categories the broad categories of
 
00:30:45.430 --> 00:30:45.440 align:start position:0%
eligible expenses that we've defined in
 
00:30:46.630 --> 00:30:46.640 align:start position:0%
this law
 
00:30:49.669 --> 00:30:49.679 align:start position:0%
and so what i'm trying to avoid is the
 
00:30:52.310 --> 00:30:52.320 align:start position:0%
agency taking over the responsibility
 
00:30:54.230 --> 00:30:54.240 align:start position:0%
that the legislature
 
00:30:56.630 --> 00:30:56.640 align:start position:0%
acknowledges that there's this catch-all
 
00:30:58.630 --> 00:30:58.640 align:start position:0%
required to administer this program
 
00:31:00.230 --> 00:31:00.240 align:start position:0%
because all of a sudden then i'm sitting
 
00:31:02.470 --> 00:31:02.480 align:start position:0%
in the seat of a legislator trying to
 
00:31:04.870 --> 00:31:04.880 align:start position:0%
enumerate what those other categories
 
00:31:07.430 --> 00:31:07.440 align:start position:0%
might be when the legislature clearly
 
00:31:09.269 --> 00:31:09.279 align:start position:0%
had the intent of trying to enumerate as
 
00:31:10.710 --> 00:31:10.720 align:start position:0%
much as they could come up with and then
 
00:31:12.950 --> 00:31:12.960 align:start position:0%
adding another category so i i would say
 
00:31:14.789 --> 00:31:14.799 align:start position:0%
that the actions of the agency are
 
00:31:17.509 --> 00:31:17.519 align:start position:0%
deferring to the supremacy of the
 
00:31:19.110 --> 00:31:19.120 align:start position:0%
legislature and trying to decide this
 
00:31:19.120 --> 00:31:20.549 align:start position:0%
legislature and trying to decide this
follow-up

00:31:20.549 --> 00:31:20.559 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
00:31:21.590 --> 00:31:21.600 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:31:24.230 --> 00:31:24.240 align:start position:0%
so right so we have this catch-all it
 
00:31:26.230 --> 00:31:26.240 align:start position:0%
you know as the agency can you
 
00:31:28.630 --> 00:31:28.640 align:start position:0%
provide some information about what what
 
00:31:31.190 --> 00:31:31.200 align:start position:0%
the department would consider uh
 
00:31:32.710 --> 00:31:32.720 align:start position:0%
applicable to those
 
00:31:34.710 --> 00:31:34.720 align:start position:0%
that catch all what expenses would fit
 
00:31:37.190 --> 00:31:37.200 align:start position:0%
into that sure so anything that fits in
 
00:31:39.669 --> 00:31:39.679 align:start position:0%
the categories a through you know up to
 
00:31:42.149 --> 00:31:42.159 align:start position:0%
o lmnop
 
00:31:44.070 --> 00:31:44.080 align:start position:0%
uh you know would would qualify right
 
00:31:45.509 --> 00:31:45.519 align:start position:0%
and those you the legislature has
 
00:31:48.950 --> 00:31:48.960 align:start position:0%
enumerated all of those um but there are
 
00:31:48.960 --> 00:31:49.990 align:start position:0%
enumerated all of those um but there are
today

00:31:49.990 --> 00:31:50.000 align:start position:0%
today
 
00:31:52.789 --> 00:31:52.799 align:start position:0%
parents who are applying for expenses
 
00:31:55.269 --> 00:31:55.279 align:start position:0%
and those are being rejected by the
 
00:31:57.110 --> 00:31:57.120 align:start position:0%
scholarship organization those
 
00:31:58.870 --> 00:31:58.880 align:start position:0%
rejections have the ability to go on
 
00:32:01.590 --> 00:32:01.600 align:start position:0%
appeal to this commission that would
 
00:32:04.470 --> 00:32:04.480 align:start position:0%
oversee those so there is a a mechanism
 
00:32:06.789 --> 00:32:06.799 align:start position:0%
for re-looking at those but some of the
 
00:32:09.350 --> 00:32:09.360 align:start position:0%
types of expenses that may be excluded
 
00:32:11.269 --> 00:32:11.279 align:start position:0%
if somebody came along and said well i
 
00:32:13.750 --> 00:32:13.760 align:start position:0%
would like to buy furniture
 
00:32:16.630 --> 00:32:16.640 align:start position:0%
for my home so that my child can do
 
00:32:18.230 --> 00:32:18.240 align:start position:0%
um you know their homework more
 
00:32:20.070 --> 00:32:20.080 align:start position:0%
comfortably or and and therefore they
 
00:32:21.430 --> 00:32:21.440 align:start position:0%
might even make the assertion that my my
 
00:32:22.630 --> 00:32:22.640 align:start position:0%
child could be more effective at their
 
00:32:25.029 --> 00:32:25.039 align:start position:0%
homework that wouldn't i've got my list
 
00:32:26.310 --> 00:32:26.320 align:start position:0%
of a through
 
00:32:28.710 --> 00:32:28.720 align:start position:0%
o uh that would not fit through a
 
00:32:30.230 --> 00:32:30.240 align:start position:0%
through m
 
00:32:32.310 --> 00:32:32.320 align:start position:0%
um n
 
00:32:35.029 --> 00:32:35.039 align:start position:0%
and uh and so then it may so a parent
 
00:32:37.029 --> 00:32:37.039 align:start position:0%
may try to fit it into category o but
 
00:32:38.950 --> 00:32:38.960 align:start position:0%
then we would look to the statute which
 
00:32:42.310 --> 00:32:42.320 align:start position:0%
says is this you know science math
 
00:32:44.389 --> 00:32:44.399 align:start position:0%
language and we would adjudicate and say
 
00:32:46.149 --> 00:32:46.159 align:start position:0%
like that's not an eligible expense
 
00:32:47.590 --> 00:32:47.600 align:start position:0%
because it doesn't fit into the
 
00:32:49.190 --> 00:32:49.200 align:start position:0%
categories that the legislature has
 
00:32:52.070 --> 00:32:52.080 align:start position:0%
given us and so it would be rejected
 
00:32:54.549 --> 00:32:54.559 align:start position:0%
and it hasn't been that difficult to
 
00:32:56.630 --> 00:32:56.640 align:start position:0%
determine you know i start with my list
 
00:32:57.990 --> 00:32:58.000 align:start position:0%
if i don't see it on the list and it
 
00:32:59.590 --> 00:32:59.600 align:start position:0%
falls into oh i go to my broader
 
00:33:01.509 --> 00:33:01.519 align:start position:0%
categories does it fit into these broad
 
00:33:02.950 --> 00:33:02.960 align:start position:0%
categories that the legislature has
 
00:33:05.190 --> 00:33:05.200 align:start position:0%
given us if it does not it's not an
 
00:33:06.630 --> 00:33:06.640 align:start position:0%
eligible expense yeah so i don't think
 
00:33:07.990 --> 00:33:08.000 align:start position:0%
you answered my question because you
 
00:33:09.909 --> 00:33:09.919 align:start position:0%
have that enumerated list and then you
 
00:33:12.549 --> 00:33:12.559 align:start position:0%
have a catch-all which is very broad so
 
00:33:14.870 --> 00:33:14.880 align:start position:0%
you have indicated some areas that would
 
00:33:17.669 --> 00:33:17.679 align:start position:0%
be excluded right but you haven't said
 
00:33:18.710 --> 00:33:18.720 align:start position:0%
what are those areas that aren't
 
00:33:20.549 --> 00:33:20.559 align:start position:0%
enumerated that might be caught up in
 
00:33:22.310 --> 00:33:22.320 align:start position:0%
the catch-all what i'm concerned is the
 
00:33:24.630 --> 00:33:24.640 align:start position:0%
breadth and the scope of the catch-all
 
00:33:26.230 --> 00:33:26.240 align:start position:0%
and i think that's exactly what the job
 
00:33:28.149 --> 00:33:28.159 align:start position:0%
car staff is telling us and so that's
 
00:33:29.269 --> 00:33:29.279 align:start position:0%
the area that i haven't heard you've
 
00:33:31.269 --> 00:33:31.279 align:start position:0%
said number of times enumerated that's
 
00:33:32.710 --> 00:33:32.720 align:start position:0%
clear we're talking about the catch-all
 
00:33:34.950 --> 00:33:34.960 align:start position:0%
here and in the rule
 
00:33:37.509 --> 00:33:37.519 align:start position:0%
i believe that we need more clarity on
 
00:33:39.110 --> 00:33:39.120 align:start position:0%
what would be included and what would
 
00:33:41.590 --> 00:33:41.600 align:start position:0%
not be included in that very very broad
 
00:33:44.230 --> 00:33:44.240 align:start position:0%
catch-all yeah so then i would just um
 
00:33:46.710 --> 00:33:46.720 align:start position:0%
again reiterate we are trying not to sit
 
00:33:48.710 --> 00:33:48.720 align:start position:0%
and usurp in any way the legislative
 
00:33:48.720 --> 00:33:49.830 align:start position:0%
and usurp in any way the legislative
power

00:33:49.830 --> 00:33:49.840 align:start position:0%
power
 
00:33:51.190 --> 00:33:51.200 align:start position:0%
which was very clear in terms of their
 
00:33:53.750 --> 00:33:53.760 align:start position:0%
enumeration and so for the agency to
 
00:33:56.389 --> 00:33:56.399 align:start position:0%
then step in and make adjudications and
 
00:33:58.870 --> 00:33:58.880 align:start position:0%
determine you know that
 
00:34:01.110 --> 00:34:01.120 align:start position:0%
beyond the fact that you've given us
 
00:34:03.990 --> 00:34:04.000 align:start position:0%
further guidance for o which is science
 
00:34:07.110 --> 00:34:07.120 align:start position:0%
math language and etc right so that is
 
00:34:09.030 --> 00:34:09.040 align:start position:0%
the frame through which we can look at
 
00:34:11.190 --> 00:34:11.200 align:start position:0%
anything that wants to pass through o
 
00:34:13.750 --> 00:34:13.760 align:start position:0%
has to meet that criteria and that's how
 
00:34:16.149 --> 00:34:16.159 align:start position:0%
we understand that legislator that
 
00:34:19.750 --> 00:34:19.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:22.230 --> 00:34:22.240 align:start position:0%
senator gray um
 
00:34:24.550 --> 00:34:24.560 align:start position:0%
i don't agree with some of the things
 
00:34:26.629 --> 00:34:26.639 align:start position:0%
that senator whitley has said
 
00:34:29.510 --> 00:34:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:33.270 --> 00:34:33.280 align:start position:0%
our job here in jail car is to
 
00:34:35.589 --> 00:34:35.599 align:start position:0%
take what the legislature did and i
 
00:34:37.430 --> 00:34:37.440 align:start position:0%
supported that bill i voted for that
 
00:34:37.440 --> 00:34:38.550 align:start position:0%
supported that bill i voted for that
bill

00:34:38.550 --> 00:34:38.560 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:34:38.560 --> 00:34:39.750 align:start position:0%
bill
and

00:34:39.750 --> 00:34:39.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:34:41.829 --> 00:34:41.839 align:start position:0%
put the rules together okay
 
00:34:44.310 --> 00:34:44.320 align:start position:0%
we put that catch all in there
 
00:34:44.320 --> 00:34:45.349 align:start position:0%
we put that catch all in there
okay

00:34:45.349 --> 00:34:45.359 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:34:47.829 --> 00:34:47.839 align:start position:0%
and if we want to slightly give them
 
00:34:49.510 --> 00:34:49.520 align:start position:0%
some more guidance
 
00:34:51.270 --> 00:34:51.280 align:start position:0%
in this rule
 
00:34:54.310 --> 00:34:54.320 align:start position:0%
similar to what i had said before is in
 
00:34:57.670 --> 00:34:57.680 align:start position:0%
the proper place say consistent with the
 
00:34:59.829 --> 00:34:59.839 align:start position:0%
other things that are in the bill that
 
00:35:01.109 --> 00:35:01.119 align:start position:0%
makes sense
 
00:35:04.950 --> 00:35:04.960 align:start position:0%
but to try and define it down to
 
00:35:07.829 --> 00:35:07.839 align:start position:0%
a very fine point does not make sense
 
00:35:10.790 --> 00:35:10.800 align:start position:0%
and it is in my opinion not consistent
 
00:35:13.030 --> 00:35:13.040 align:start position:0%
with what we're supposed to do
 
00:35:15.109 --> 00:35:15.119 align:start position:0%
in the rules committee thank you
 
00:35:17.030 --> 00:35:17.040 align:start position:0%
representative mcguire
 
00:35:18.470 --> 00:35:18.480 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:35:20.150 --> 00:35:20.160 align:start position:0%
i'd like to ask the commissioner whether
 
00:35:22.069 --> 00:35:22.079 align:start position:0%
or not he knows
 
00:35:24.390 --> 00:35:24.400 align:start position:0%
whether the scholarship organization has
 
00:35:24.400 --> 00:35:25.510 align:start position:0%
whether the scholarship organization has
published

00:35:25.510 --> 00:35:25.520 align:start position:0%
published
 
00:35:27.990 --> 00:35:28.000 align:start position:0%
any qualifying expenses consistent with
 
00:35:29.430 --> 00:35:29.440 align:start position:0%
paragraph o
 
00:35:31.349 --> 00:35:31.359 align:start position:0%
which they're required to do by this
 
00:35:31.359 --> 00:35:33.109 align:start position:0%
which they're required to do by this
rule

00:35:33.109 --> 00:35:33.119 align:start position:0%
rule
 
00:35:34.710 --> 00:35:34.720 align:start position:0%
yes i don't believe that that has been
 
00:35:36.069 --> 00:35:36.079 align:start position:0%
published at this point in time so i
 
00:35:38.230 --> 00:35:38.240 align:start position:0%
can't i don't know the answer to that
 
00:35:39.990 --> 00:35:40.000 align:start position:0%
but i think but we will be publishing
 
00:35:42.470 --> 00:35:42.480 align:start position:0%
that as it comes to i think that that
 
00:35:46.069 --> 00:35:46.079 align:start position:0%
by publishing what qualifying expenses
 
00:35:48.470 --> 00:35:48.480 align:start position:0%
have been considered to fall under that
 
00:35:48.480 --> 00:35:49.589 align:start position:0%
have been considered to fall under that
catch-all

00:35:49.589 --> 00:35:49.599 align:start position:0%
catch-all
 
00:35:51.829 --> 00:35:51.839 align:start position:0%
we will be able to determine if that's
 
00:35:54.470 --> 00:35:54.480 align:start position:0%
too broad or not broad enough
 
00:35:57.349 --> 00:35:57.359 align:start position:0%
because right now we don't have the data
 
00:35:59.510 --> 00:35:59.520 align:start position:0%
we've just the program has just barely
 
00:35:59.520 --> 00:36:00.950 align:start position:0%
we've just the program has just barely
started

00:36:00.950 --> 00:36:00.960 align:start position:0%
started
 
00:36:02.950 --> 00:36:02.960 align:start position:0%
and so i think that by
 
00:36:02.960 --> 00:36:04.069 align:start position:0%
and so i think that by
showing

00:36:04.069 --> 00:36:04.079 align:start position:0%
showing
 
00:36:07.190 --> 00:36:07.200 align:start position:0%
that what rules are excuse me what types
 
00:36:09.030 --> 00:36:09.040 align:start position:0%
of things qualify
 
00:36:11.030 --> 00:36:11.040 align:start position:0%
for that section o
 
00:36:13.109 --> 00:36:13.119 align:start position:0%
we will be able to answer senator
 
00:36:15.030 --> 00:36:15.040 align:start position:0%
whitley's question and narrow it in
 
00:36:17.829 --> 00:36:17.839 align:start position:0%
legislation if necessary
 
00:36:19.829 --> 00:36:19.839 align:start position:0%
senator whitney thank you thank you so
 
00:36:21.670 --> 00:36:21.680 align:start position:0%
um thank you for that clarification but
 
00:36:21.680 --> 00:36:22.550 align:start position:0%
um thank you for that clarification but
wouldn't

00:36:22.550 --> 00:36:22.560 align:start position:0%
wouldn't
 
00:36:24.390 --> 00:36:24.400 align:start position:0%
my concern and i think it's the concern
 
00:36:26.390 --> 00:36:26.400 align:start position:0%
of the jail car staff is that you know
 
00:36:28.470 --> 00:36:28.480 align:start position:0%
letting the scholarship organization
 
00:36:30.630 --> 00:36:30.640 align:start position:0%
determine that scope would be sort of an
 
00:36:33.030 --> 00:36:33.040 align:start position:0%
information impermissible delegation of
 
00:36:34.630 --> 00:36:34.640 align:start position:0%
authority by the department of education
 
00:36:37.270 --> 00:36:37.280 align:start position:0%
wouldn't you agree
 
00:36:38.710 --> 00:36:38.720 align:start position:0%
actually the law specifically says that
 
00:36:40.150 --> 00:36:40.160 align:start position:0%
the scholarship organization is
 
00:36:41.750 --> 00:36:41.760 align:start position:0%
determining whether those are eligible
 
00:36:43.589 --> 00:36:43.599 align:start position:0%
expenses you did not delegate that power
 
00:36:45.430 --> 00:36:45.440 align:start position:0%
to us we do have oversight
 
00:36:47.270 --> 00:36:47.280 align:start position:0%
responsibility so we can go in and do
 
00:36:49.670 --> 00:36:49.680 align:start position:0%
programmatic monitoring um but in fact
 
00:36:50.790 --> 00:36:50.800 align:start position:0%
we're trying to follow the law as
 
00:36:53.030 --> 00:36:53.040 align:start position:0%
closely as possible with this
 
00:36:54.630 --> 00:36:54.640 align:start position:0%
mr chair
 
00:36:57.270 --> 00:36:57.280 align:start position:0%
representative representative thank you
 
00:36:59.750 --> 00:36:59.760 align:start position:0%
i'm just trying to gather it all back in
 
00:36:59.760 --> 00:37:00.710 align:start position:0%
i'm just trying to gather it all back in
so

00:37:00.710 --> 00:37:00.720 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:37:03.109 --> 00:37:03.119 align:start position:0%
the way i read this section d on here is
 
00:37:04.950 --> 00:37:04.960 align:start position:0%
that it took section o which was
 
00:37:06.630 --> 00:37:06.640 align:start position:0%
basically we didn't want to create a non
 
00:37:09.030 --> 00:37:09.040 align:start position:0%
an exhaustive list we said here's a list
 
00:37:10.310 --> 00:37:10.320 align:start position:0%
and then
 
00:37:11.670 --> 00:37:11.680 align:start position:0%
here's if there's anything else that you
 
00:37:13.030 --> 00:37:13.040 align:start position:0%
find that falls in because we didn't
 
00:37:15.510 --> 00:37:15.520 align:start position:0%
think of it it goes on the category oh
 
00:37:17.109 --> 00:37:17.119 align:start position:0%
is that the first am i getting that
 
00:37:18.790 --> 00:37:18.800 align:start position:0%
first section right this is how we
 
00:37:20.470 --> 00:37:20.480 align:start position:0%
understand the legislature having passed
 
00:37:22.390 --> 00:37:22.400 align:start position:0%
it to us thank you follow up mr chair
 
00:37:25.270 --> 00:37:25.280 align:start position:0%
follow up so and then what you've done
 
00:37:26.790 --> 00:37:26.800 align:start position:0%
is taking that that direction from the
 
00:37:29.190 --> 00:37:29.200 align:start position:0%
legislature that says there's here's our
 
00:37:30.870 --> 00:37:30.880 align:start position:0%
you know we have a non-exhaustive list
 
00:37:33.349 --> 00:37:33.359 align:start position:0%
here and get gave you the catch-all is
 
00:37:36.550 --> 00:37:36.560 align:start position:0%
the scholarship organization will think
 
00:37:37.910 --> 00:37:37.920 align:start position:0%
of the things that we didn't think of
 
00:37:39.829 --> 00:37:39.839 align:start position:0%
and with the number of parents we have
 
00:37:42.069 --> 00:37:42.079 align:start position:0%
uh out there that may come up with an
 
00:37:44.630 --> 00:37:44.640 align:start position:0%
innovative idea it allows you to be able
 
00:37:46.069 --> 00:37:46.079 align:start position:0%
to take that innovative idea decide
 
00:37:47.670 --> 00:37:47.680 align:start position:0%
whether it falls within the education or
 
00:37:49.670 --> 00:37:49.680 align:start position:0%
the scholarship program decide whether
 
00:37:51.430 --> 00:37:51.440 align:start position:0%
it's an educational benefit to the child
 
00:37:53.030 --> 00:37:53.040 align:start position:0%
and if it is it can be added under the
 
00:37:55.349 --> 00:37:55.359 align:start position:0%
category of oh it'll then be published
 
00:37:56.950 --> 00:37:56.960 align:start position:0%
to the website so any other parent who
 
00:37:58.470 --> 00:37:58.480 align:start position:0%
want to think think about that same
 
00:37:59.910 --> 00:37:59.920 align:start position:0%
thing will also be able to see oh that's
 
00:38:02.310 --> 00:38:02.320 align:start position:0%
an allowed expense i can do that
 
00:38:04.069 --> 00:38:04.079 align:start position:0%
is that and then that list will
 
00:38:05.510 --> 00:38:05.520 align:start position:0%
ultimately grow
 
00:38:07.750 --> 00:38:07.760 align:start position:0%
to so parents will be clear what what
 
00:38:09.910 --> 00:38:09.920 align:start position:0%
things that the legislature didn't agree
 
00:38:12.230 --> 00:38:12.240 align:start position:0%
with or didn't think of and put into the
 
00:38:12.240 --> 00:38:12.950 align:start position:0%
with or didn't think of and put into the
the

00:38:12.950 --> 00:38:12.960 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:38:12.960 --> 00:38:13.829 align:start position:0%
the
list

00:38:13.829 --> 00:38:13.839 align:start position:0%
list
 
00:38:17.109 --> 00:38:17.119 align:start position:0%
uh that are eligible and also what's not
 
00:38:18.470 --> 00:38:18.480 align:start position:0%
right they can choose if it's not a list
 
00:38:20.310 --> 00:38:20.320 align:start position:0%
they can still apply and maybe add it or
 
00:38:22.230 --> 00:38:22.240 align:start position:0%
not is that is that
 
00:38:23.670 --> 00:38:23.680 align:start position:0%
the way you're anticipating is going to
 
00:38:25.510 --> 00:38:25.520 align:start position:0%
flow i do and the only constraining
 
00:38:26.950 --> 00:38:26.960 align:start position:0%
factor i have is just because a parent
 
00:38:29.349 --> 00:38:29.359 align:start position:0%
brings something to us under o doesn't
 
00:38:31.430 --> 00:38:31.440 align:start position:0%
mean that it's another eligible expense
 
00:38:33.349 --> 00:38:33.359 align:start position:0%
is that eligibility adjudication takes
 
00:38:35.030 --> 00:38:35.040 align:start position:0%
place when i go back to
 
00:38:38.630 --> 00:38:38.640 align:start position:0%
194 f3 3d1 you know which is science
 
00:38:40.069 --> 00:38:40.079 align:start position:0%
math and stuff like that right so if
 
00:38:41.349 --> 00:38:41.359 align:start position:0%
they bring us something that doesn't fit
 
00:38:42.790 --> 00:38:42.800 align:start position:0%
into these categories that you've given
 
00:38:44.390 --> 00:38:44.400 align:start position:0%
to us then we would adjudicate that as
 
00:38:48.150 --> 00:38:48.160 align:start position:0%
uneligible one last follow-up mr chair
 
00:38:50.550 --> 00:38:50.560 align:start position:0%
and then lastly i i would i would
 
00:38:52.790 --> 00:38:52.800 align:start position:0%
anticipate that your reviewing is part
 
00:38:54.230 --> 00:38:54.240 align:start position:0%
of contract management all those things
 
00:38:55.510 --> 00:38:55.520 align:start position:0%
that have been approved and if you see
 
00:38:57.430 --> 00:38:57.440 align:start position:0%
something you disagree with you can you
 
00:38:58.790 --> 00:38:58.800 align:start position:0%
can challenge that with the with a
 
00:39:00.470 --> 00:39:00.480 align:start position:0%
scholarship organization or if a
 
00:39:00.480 --> 00:39:01.990 align:start position:0%
scholarship organization or if a
legislator

00:39:01.990 --> 00:39:02.000 align:start position:0%
legislator
 
00:39:03.270 --> 00:39:03.280 align:start position:0%
sees something on that list that
 
00:39:05.750 --> 00:39:05.760 align:start position:0%
disagrees with we can put a bill in and
 
00:39:08.069 --> 00:39:08.079 align:start position:0%
and deal with that again adding
 
00:39:11.270 --> 00:39:11.280 align:start position:0%
lmnop you know another item on the list
 
00:39:13.030 --> 00:39:13.040 align:start position:0%
and and exclude something if we think
 
00:39:15.109 --> 00:39:15.119 align:start position:0%
it's inappropriate is that how we see
 
00:39:17.589 --> 00:39:17.599 align:start position:0%
this slowly rolling out and working
 
00:39:19.670 --> 00:39:19.680 align:start position:0%
correct and as well then parents also
 
00:39:21.750 --> 00:39:21.760 align:start position:0%
have a valve relief if they don't
 
00:39:23.430 --> 00:39:23.440 align:start position:0%
believe it's correct then they have this
 
00:39:24.950 --> 00:39:24.960 align:start position:0%
commission to be able to go and have
 
00:39:27.030 --> 00:39:27.040 align:start position:0%
that evaluated and adjudicated as well
 
00:39:33.910 --> 00:39:33.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:35.430 --> 00:39:35.440 align:start position:0%
go ahead mike
 
00:39:40.710 --> 00:39:40.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:40.720 --> 00:39:43.510 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:39:43.510 --> 00:39:43.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:46.230 --> 00:39:46.240 align:start position:0%
kim had a large comment here um i've
 
00:39:48.950 --> 00:39:48.960 align:start position:0%
read the department's response
 
00:39:50.790 --> 00:39:50.800 align:start position:0%
i have to agree with them regarding
 
00:39:54.230 --> 00:39:54.240 align:start position:0%
ferpa and much of what this says but
 
00:39:56.230 --> 00:39:56.240 align:start position:0%
i have great concern with the intro
 
00:39:58.710 --> 00:39:58.720 align:start position:0%
intro language to g
 
00:40:00.470 --> 00:40:00.480 align:start position:0%
saying the scholarship organization
 
00:40:02.470 --> 00:40:02.480 align:start position:0%
shall have access to confidential
 
00:40:03.990 --> 00:40:04.000 align:start position:0%
student information
 
00:40:06.309 --> 00:40:06.319 align:start position:0%
that doesn't say how the department has
 
00:40:08.150 --> 00:40:08.160 align:start position:0%
indicated that that is going to be
 
00:40:10.470 --> 00:40:10.480 align:start position:0%
requested on the application form that's
 
00:40:14.790 --> 00:40:14.800 align:start position:0%
created by the scholarship organization
 
00:40:16.870 --> 00:40:16.880 align:start position:0%
but as this is worded there's nothing to
 
00:40:19.589 --> 00:40:19.599 align:start position:0%
prevent the scholarship organization
 
00:40:21.589 --> 00:40:21.599 align:start position:0%
from going to a public school and saying
 
00:40:27.109 --> 00:40:27.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:28.790 --> 00:40:28.800 align:start position:0%
so happy to respond to that so we have a
 
00:40:31.109 --> 00:40:31.119 align:start position:0%
myriad of other laws that restrict the
 
00:40:34.069 --> 00:40:34.079 align:start position:0%
ability of both leas as well as the sea
 
00:40:37.270 --> 00:40:37.280 align:start position:0%
to disclose information even with
 
00:40:39.670 --> 00:40:39.680 align:start position:0%
regulatory authority for the scholarship
 
00:40:42.630 --> 00:40:42.640 align:start position:0%
organization to uh if if in fact that's
 
00:40:43.829 --> 00:40:43.839 align:start position:0%
what you believe that they would be
 
00:40:45.589 --> 00:40:45.599 align:start position:0%
asking for this confidential student
 
00:40:48.790 --> 00:40:48.800 align:start position:0%
information um the body that control who
 
00:40:50.390 --> 00:40:50.400 align:start position:0%
controls that information doesn't have
 
00:40:54.550 --> 00:40:54.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:55.990 --> 00:40:56.000 align:start position:0%
that's right but
 
00:40:58.230 --> 00:40:58.240 align:start position:0%
as the word rule is worded it could an
 
00:41:00.550 --> 00:41:00.560 align:start position:0%
attempt could be made it also would seem
 
00:41:00.560 --> 00:41:01.829 align:start position:0%
attempt could be made it also would seem
to

00:41:01.829 --> 00:41:01.839 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:41:03.910 --> 00:41:03.920 align:start position:0%
indicate that scholarship organization
 
00:41:03.920 --> 00:41:04.790 align:start position:0%
indicate that scholarship organization
could

00:41:04.790 --> 00:41:04.800 align:start position:0%
could
 
00:41:07.349 --> 00:41:07.359 align:start position:0%
try to try to compel the parent to
 
00:41:09.750 --> 00:41:09.760 align:start position:0%
provide this information
 
00:41:11.990 --> 00:41:12.000 align:start position:0%
well when the when the department noted
 
00:41:14.390 --> 00:41:14.400 align:start position:0%
in its response that
 
00:41:16.150 --> 00:41:16.160 align:start position:0%
the scholarship organization will have
 
00:41:18.150 --> 00:41:18.160 align:start position:0%
access to confidential information from
 
00:41:19.349 --> 00:41:19.359 align:start position:0%
the parent
 
00:41:22.470 --> 00:41:22.480 align:start position:0%
it it was simply trying to
 
00:41:24.950 --> 00:41:24.960 align:start position:0%
articulate that when an application is
 
00:41:26.790 --> 00:41:26.800 align:start position:0%
received the simple
 
00:41:28.710 --> 00:41:28.720 align:start position:0%
biographical data of the applicant the
 
00:41:31.270 --> 00:41:31.280 align:start position:0%
name the date of birth the address
 
00:41:32.790 --> 00:41:32.800 align:start position:0%
that's all information that would be
 
00:41:34.630 --> 00:41:34.640 align:start position:0%
considered confidential information if a
 
00:41:37.430 --> 00:41:37.440 align:start position:0%
school held it under ferpa so just as a
 
00:41:39.109 --> 00:41:39.119 align:start position:0%
matter of course if someone wants to
 
00:41:41.270 --> 00:41:41.280 align:start position:0%
fill out their child's name put it on a
 
00:41:42.470 --> 00:41:42.480 align:start position:0%
piece of paper and give it to the
 
00:41:44.069 --> 00:41:44.079 align:start position:0%
scholarship organization that's
 
00:41:45.750 --> 00:41:45.760 align:start position:0%
information that if a school had it they
 
00:41:47.510 --> 00:41:47.520 align:start position:0%
would have to treat as a ferpa record
 
00:41:48.710 --> 00:41:48.720 align:start position:0%
that's what we're trying to capture
 
00:41:50.710 --> 00:41:50.720 align:start position:0%
we're not we weren't trying to
 
00:41:52.309 --> 00:41:52.319 align:start position:0%
give any authority to the scholarship
 
00:41:54.470 --> 00:41:54.480 align:start position:0%
organization to ask for anything
 
00:41:57.510 --> 00:41:57.520 align:start position:0%
other than what was uh is is necessary
 
00:42:00.550 --> 00:42:00.560 align:start position:0%
for their application to enroll a child
 
00:42:03.430 --> 00:42:03.440 align:start position:0%
i i certainly understand and not trying
 
00:42:05.190 --> 00:42:05.200 align:start position:0%
to suggest that
 
00:42:07.589 --> 00:42:07.599 align:start position:0%
eligibility for uh the pro to
 
00:42:10.390 --> 00:42:10.400 align:start position:0%
participate in the program um by
 
00:42:12.470 --> 00:42:12.480 align:start position:0%
granting them the ability to do that it
 
00:42:15.109 --> 00:42:15.119 align:start position:0%
does not then grant them the ability to
 
00:42:16.950 --> 00:42:16.960 align:start position:0%
go anywhere they want and seek
 
00:42:19.190 --> 00:42:19.200 align:start position:0%
confidential information
 
00:42:19.200 --> 00:42:20.630 align:start position:0%
confidential information
from

00:42:20.630 --> 00:42:20.640 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:42:23.829 --> 00:42:23.839 align:start position:0%
you know participants in the program and
 
00:42:23.839 --> 00:42:24.710 align:start position:0%
you know participants in the program and
we

00:42:24.710 --> 00:42:24.720 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:42:25.990 --> 00:42:26.000 align:start position:0%
do have
 
00:42:28.710 --> 00:42:28.720 align:start position:0%
the ability to influence the application
 
00:42:30.470 --> 00:42:30.480 align:start position:0%
and would not
 
00:42:32.230 --> 00:42:32.240 align:start position:0%
allow an application with parents to go
 
00:42:33.750 --> 00:42:33.760 align:start position:0%
forward that would be collecting
 
00:42:36.230 --> 00:42:36.240 align:start position:0%
superfluous or unnecessary information
 
00:42:37.750 --> 00:42:37.760 align:start position:0%
needed for a simple adjudication of
 
00:42:44.230 --> 00:42:44.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:48.309 --> 00:42:48.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:51.430 --> 00:42:51.440 align:start position:0%
on the next page page 10
 
00:42:53.510 --> 00:42:53.520 align:start position:0%
paragraph i
 
00:42:54.950 --> 00:42:54.960 align:start position:0%
again we're dealing with other
 
00:42:56.630 --> 00:42:56.640 align:start position:0%
educational expenses approved by the
 
00:42:59.109 --> 00:42:59.119 align:start position:0%
scholarship organization
 
00:43:04.069 --> 00:43:04.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:06.550 --> 00:43:06.560 align:start position:0%
the issue raised by the aclu and
 
00:43:09.030 --> 00:43:09.040 align:start position:0%
attorneys ellen regarding this being so
 
00:43:11.190 --> 00:43:11.200 align:start position:0%
broad that
 
00:43:12.950 --> 00:43:12.960 align:start position:0%
religious instruction
 
00:43:15.910 --> 00:43:15.920 align:start position:0%
might fall under this and uh
 
00:43:17.670 --> 00:43:17.680 align:start position:0%
i i know that we disagree with the
 
00:43:21.109 --> 00:43:21.119 align:start position:0%
department but uh we feel that
 
00:43:23.589 --> 00:43:23.599 align:start position:0%
any allowing of paying for religious
 
00:43:25.349 --> 00:43:25.359 align:start position:0%
instruction by the state would violate
 
00:43:30.390 --> 00:43:30.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:31.750 --> 00:43:31.760 align:start position:0%
i know that's going to be discussed
 
00:43:33.910 --> 00:43:33.920 align:start position:0%
further so
 
00:43:36.309 --> 00:43:36.319 align:start position:0%
yeah so um and i i would like to allow
 
00:43:37.910 --> 00:43:37.920 align:start position:0%
attorney bond to do this but it falls
 
00:43:40.790 --> 00:43:40.800 align:start position:0%
back to the conversation relative to oh
 
00:43:42.870 --> 00:43:42.880 align:start position:0%
you know the rule and the law are quite
 
00:43:44.550 --> 00:43:44.560 align:start position:0%
clear that of what is an allowable
 
00:43:46.950 --> 00:43:46.960 align:start position:0%
expense what is not an allowable expense
 
00:43:50.630 --> 00:43:50.640 align:start position:0%
so just as religious instruction as
 
00:43:53.030 --> 00:43:53.040 align:start position:0%
the jail card attorney has pointed out
 
00:43:54.550 --> 00:43:54.560 align:start position:0%
would be ineligible it would be
 
00:43:55.510 --> 00:43:55.520 align:start position:0%
ineligible because it would be
 
00:43:58.069 --> 00:43:58.079 align:start position:0%
non-constitutional right and so we don't
 
00:44:00.150 --> 00:44:00.160 align:start position:0%
enumerate everything in this rule that
 
00:44:02.390 --> 00:44:02.400 align:start position:0%
would be non-constitutional um there are
 
00:44:05.190 --> 00:44:05.200 align:start position:0%
other expenses that would be not allowed
 
00:44:07.750 --> 00:44:07.760 align:start position:0%
and so not only could you not you know
 
00:44:09.990 --> 00:44:10.000 align:start position:0%
in this catch-all of oh wrap up
 
00:44:11.430 --> 00:44:11.440 align:start position:0%
religious instruction because that would
 
00:44:14.069 --> 00:44:14.079 align:start position:0%
become ineligible you would also not be
 
00:44:17.030 --> 00:44:17.040 align:start position:0%
able to wrap up uh you know instruction
 
00:44:18.550 --> 00:44:18.560 align:start position:0%
for i think we would mention a student
 
00:44:20.790 --> 00:44:20.800 align:start position:0%
to become you know an airline pilot
 
00:44:22.230 --> 00:44:22.240 align:start position:0%
right because that doesn't fit into the
 
00:44:23.910 --> 00:44:23.920 align:start position:0%
category of oh
 
00:44:26.069 --> 00:44:26.079 align:start position:0%
and then i'd like to attorney bond to
 
00:44:27.510 --> 00:44:27.520 align:start position:0%
weigh in really on some of the legal
 
00:44:28.309 --> 00:44:28.319 align:start position:0%
aspects relative to the
 
00:44:28.319 --> 00:44:31.349 align:start position:0%
aspects relative to the
constitutionality

00:44:31.349 --> 00:44:31.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:33.510 --> 00:44:33.520 align:start position:0%
thank you so um
 
00:44:35.829 --> 00:44:35.839 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to clarify with the ols
 
00:44:37.109 --> 00:44:37.119 align:start position:0%
comment that
 
00:44:38.390 --> 00:44:38.400 align:start position:0%
that they know they disagree with the
 
00:44:40.390 --> 00:44:40.400 align:start position:0%
department about the
 
00:44:40.400 --> 00:44:41.670 align:start position:0%
department about the
um

00:44:41.670 --> 00:44:41.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:43.349 --> 00:44:43.359 align:start position:0%
application of funds for religious
 
00:44:44.630 --> 00:44:44.640 align:start position:0%
instruction i don't think there actually
 
00:44:48.950 --> 00:44:48.960 align:start position:0%
is a disagreement so i i reviewed um
 
00:44:51.109 --> 00:44:51.119 align:start position:0%
the aclu's letter that they sent to the
 
00:44:52.390 --> 00:44:52.400 align:start position:0%
committee yesterday or at least the
 
00:44:54.150 --> 00:44:54.160 align:start position:0%
department received it yesterday
 
00:44:54.160 --> 00:44:55.270 align:start position:0%
department received it yesterday
um

00:44:55.270 --> 00:44:55.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:56.790 --> 00:44:56.800 align:start position:0%
and i don't think i think we're a lot
 
00:45:00.390 --> 00:45:00.400 align:start position:0%
closer uh than that letter indicates so
 
00:45:00.400 --> 00:45:01.829 align:start position:0%
closer uh than that letter indicates so
the

00:45:01.829 --> 00:45:01.839 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:45:03.910 --> 00:45:03.920 align:start position:0%
the department agrees that it would be
 
00:45:05.990 --> 00:45:06.000 align:start position:0%
impermissible to spend the funds on
 
00:45:07.829 --> 00:45:07.839 align:start position:0%
religious instruction um we're aware
 
00:45:09.270 --> 00:45:09.280 align:start position:0%
that where the
 
00:45:11.270 --> 00:45:11.280 align:start position:0%
we agree we do agree with that point
 
00:45:13.670 --> 00:45:13.680 align:start position:0%
where we disagree is this issue with the
 
00:45:15.190 --> 00:45:15.200 align:start position:0%
catch-all language so i'd refer the
 
00:45:17.109 --> 00:45:17.119 align:start position:0%
committee again to our letter of
 
00:45:19.829 --> 00:45:19.839 align:start position:0%
february 15th page six where we list the
 
00:45:22.950 --> 00:45:22.960 align:start position:0%
case law um numerous course uh cases
 
00:45:24.390 --> 00:45:24.400 align:start position:0%
from new hampshire supreme court where
 
00:45:26.550 --> 00:45:26.560 align:start position:0%
when there's a list with broad language
 
00:45:27.829 --> 00:45:27.839 align:start position:0%
there's a common rule of general
 
00:45:31.109 --> 00:45:31.119 align:start position:0%
statutory construction that those other
 
00:45:32.710 --> 00:45:32.720 align:start position:0%
instances must be comparable to the
 
00:45:34.390 --> 00:45:34.400 align:start position:0%
specific examples in the list so because
 
00:45:36.069 --> 00:45:36.079 align:start position:0%
of that because there's nothing that
 
00:45:37.670 --> 00:45:37.680 align:start position:0%
implies religious instruction in that
 
00:45:39.990 --> 00:45:40.000 align:start position:0%
list we don't believe that religious
 
00:45:41.510 --> 00:45:41.520 align:start position:0%
instruction is implied
 
00:45:43.190 --> 00:45:43.200 align:start position:0%
um nevertheless
 
00:45:44.710 --> 00:45:44.720 align:start position:0%
even if someone were to read the statute
 
00:45:45.990 --> 00:45:46.000 align:start position:0%
that way it would be clearly
 
00:45:48.550 --> 00:45:48.560 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional in our view um so we
 
00:45:51.030 --> 00:45:51.040 align:start position:0%
would in our contractual relationship
 
00:45:52.630 --> 00:45:52.640 align:start position:0%
with the vendor in this program the
 
00:45:54.950 --> 00:45:54.960 align:start position:0%
scholarship organization that they
 
00:45:56.309 --> 00:45:56.319 align:start position:0%
certainly understand that that's our
 
00:45:57.670 --> 00:45:57.680 align:start position:0%
understanding that that's not a
 
00:45:59.910 --> 00:45:59.920 align:start position:0%
permissible use of these funds
 
00:46:01.990 --> 00:46:02.000 align:start position:0%
and as the commissioner said
 
00:46:03.190 --> 00:46:03.200 align:start position:0%
it goes without saying that the
 
00:46:05.990 --> 00:46:06.000 align:start position:0%
constitution is part of the
 
00:46:07.910 --> 00:46:07.920 align:start position:0%
of the law of the land it doesn't need
 
00:46:09.589 --> 00:46:09.599 align:start position:0%
to be that particular constitutional
 
00:46:12.309 --> 00:46:12.319 align:start position:0%
provision need not be specified here and
 
00:46:15.109 --> 00:46:15.119 align:start position:0%
at the exclusion of others and also
 
00:46:17.829 --> 00:46:17.839 align:start position:0%
because we have this this list if we if
 
00:46:19.750 --> 00:46:19.760 align:start position:0%
we with the broad catch-all that's
 
00:46:21.670 --> 00:46:21.680 align:start position:0%
supposed to be read in the way that or
 
00:46:22.870 --> 00:46:22.880 align:start position:0%
that we believe is supposed to be read
 
00:46:24.870 --> 00:46:24.880 align:start position:0%
in the way we've described in our letter
 
00:46:26.630 --> 00:46:26.640 align:start position:0%
if we start enumerating items that
 
00:46:29.109 --> 00:46:29.119 align:start position:0%
specifically funds can't be used for our
 
00:46:30.870 --> 00:46:30.880 align:start position:0%
concern is that other things that the
 
00:46:33.349 --> 00:46:33.359 align:start position:0%
funds clearly can't be used for will by
 
00:46:35.670 --> 00:46:35.680 align:start position:0%
implication there be be acceptable and
 
00:46:36.950 --> 00:46:36.960 align:start position:0%
we think that will be confusing for
 
00:46:39.829 --> 00:46:39.839 align:start position:0%
members of the public so we we agree
 
00:46:42.630 --> 00:46:42.640 align:start position:0%
that a reuse of religious funds
 
00:46:44.470 --> 00:46:44.480 align:start position:0%
our use of funds for religious
 
00:46:47.270 --> 00:46:47.280 align:start position:0%
instruction would be unconstitutional um
 
00:46:50.470 --> 00:46:50.480 align:start position:0%
and we think it it uh is such an obvious
 
00:46:52.790 --> 00:46:52.800 align:start position:0%
point that it need not be articulated in
 
00:46:53.990 --> 00:46:54.000 align:start position:0%
the rule to the exclusion of other
 
00:46:56.069 --> 00:46:56.079 align:start position:0%
things that would also be impermissible
 
00:46:57.990 --> 00:46:58.000 align:start position:0%
and then there's other factors too
 
00:46:58.000 --> 00:46:59.109 align:start position:0%
and then there's other factors too
um

00:46:59.109 --> 00:46:59.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:01.349 --> 00:47:01.359 align:start position:0%
you know the department in in navigating
 
00:47:03.349 --> 00:47:03.359 align:start position:0%
this we have to be mindful of the
 
00:47:04.870 --> 00:47:04.880 align:start position:0%
constitutional requirements under both
 
00:47:06.790 --> 00:47:06.800 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire and the state and the
 
00:47:08.630 --> 00:47:08.640 align:start position:0%
federal constitutions
 
00:47:08.640 --> 00:47:11.030 align:start position:0%
federal constitutions
and

00:47:11.030 --> 00:47:11.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:47:12.630 --> 00:47:12.640 align:start position:0%
under the federal constitution there's
 
00:47:14.390 --> 00:47:14.400 align:start position:0%
both an establishment
 
00:47:17.430 --> 00:47:17.440 align:start position:0%
clause and a free exercise clause that
 
00:47:19.670 --> 00:47:19.680 align:start position:0%
we have to balance those
 
00:47:22.150 --> 00:47:22.160 align:start position:0%
to to to spell out one part of it which
 
00:47:23.510 --> 00:47:23.520 align:start position:0%
this would be like an establishment
 
00:47:25.190 --> 00:47:25.200 align:start position:0%
clause problem
 
00:47:27.349 --> 00:47:27.359 align:start position:0%
that we'd be addressing in the rule to
 
00:47:30.230 --> 00:47:30.240 align:start position:0%
do that and not also weigh in on free
 
00:47:31.829 --> 00:47:31.839 align:start position:0%
exercise issues that may come up in the
 
00:47:34.230 --> 00:47:34.240 align:start position:0%
adjudications it it just seems
 
00:47:36.790 --> 00:47:36.800 align:start position:0%
inappropriate to the department to have
 
00:47:38.470 --> 00:47:38.480 align:start position:0%
essentially a treatise on constitutional
 
00:47:42.230 --> 00:47:42.240 align:start position:0%
law in the rules when the it so it is
 
00:47:44.630 --> 00:47:44.640 align:start position:0%
true we know and correct me if i'm wrong
 
00:47:46.309 --> 00:47:46.319 align:start position:0%
funds are going to religious schools
 
00:47:46.319 --> 00:47:47.349 align:start position:0%
funds are going to religious schools
correct

00:47:47.349 --> 00:47:47.359 align:start position:0%
correct
 
00:47:49.510 --> 00:47:49.520 align:start position:0%
right and so
 
00:47:51.270 --> 00:47:51.280 align:start position:0%
those schools
 
00:47:54.069 --> 00:47:54.079 align:start position:0%
okay we're they are not constitutional
 
00:47:55.829 --> 00:47:55.839 align:start position:0%
scholars i'm a lawyer i don't know the
 
00:47:58.870 --> 00:47:58.880 align:start position:0%
law in every every single area
 
00:48:01.030 --> 00:48:01.040 align:start position:0%
if you agree that that that use is
 
00:48:03.109 --> 00:48:03.119 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional then why wouldn't you
 
00:48:05.190 --> 00:48:05.200 align:start position:0%
put why wouldn't you put that
 
00:48:07.750 --> 00:48:07.760 align:start position:0%
in the stat in the rule i don't i guess
 
00:48:09.750 --> 00:48:09.760 align:start position:0%
i'm not understanding the objection
 
00:48:11.430 --> 00:48:11.440 align:start position:0%
because it's such a clear violation of
 
00:48:13.829 --> 00:48:13.839 align:start position:0%
the constitution right
 
00:48:15.990 --> 00:48:16.000 align:start position:0%
why and right so it's not in the statute
 
00:48:17.829 --> 00:48:17.839 align:start position:0%
they can't go to the statute i i don't
 
00:48:19.349 --> 00:48:19.359 align:start position:0%
understand the objection to actually
 
00:48:21.910 --> 00:48:21.920 align:start position:0%
putting that in the rule to provide
 
00:48:24.710 --> 00:48:24.720 align:start position:0%
clear guidance to our taxpayers to
 
00:48:27.990 --> 00:48:28.000 align:start position:0%
provide clear guidance to the
 
00:48:29.589 --> 00:48:29.599 align:start position:0%
organizations that are receiving this
 
00:48:31.589 --> 00:48:31.599 align:start position:0%
money that this is not permissible you
 
00:48:33.270 --> 00:48:33.280 align:start position:0%
know the money is going to religious
 
00:48:36.309 --> 00:48:36.319 align:start position:0%
schools how do i know as a taxpayer that
 
00:48:37.670 --> 00:48:37.680 align:start position:0%
they're not going to use that money for
 
00:48:39.430 --> 00:48:39.440 align:start position:0%
religious instruction how do i know that
 
00:48:40.950 --> 00:48:40.960 align:start position:0%
yeah so as a taxpayer i would hope that
 
00:48:42.470 --> 00:48:42.480 align:start position:0%
you would know the u.s constitution and
 
00:48:43.510 --> 00:48:43.520 align:start position:0%
you would know that that would be a
 
00:48:45.430 --> 00:48:45.440 align:start position:0%
prohibited activity and therefore would
 
00:48:47.589 --> 00:48:47.599 align:start position:0%
be unallowed but just to your first
 
00:48:47.599 --> 00:48:48.390 align:start position:0%
be unallowed but just to your first
point

00:48:48.390 --> 00:48:48.400 align:start position:0%
point
 
00:48:50.230 --> 00:48:50.240 align:start position:0%
we believe that by including one
 
00:48:53.510 --> 00:48:53.520 align:start position:0%
exclusion will confuse the law because
 
00:48:55.270 --> 00:48:55.280 align:start position:0%
by a numerous what you're not allowed to
 
00:48:58.549 --> 00:48:58.559 align:start position:0%
spend it on by default then parents
 
00:49:00.309 --> 00:49:00.319 align:start position:0%
might say well they didn't call out be
 
00:49:01.589 --> 00:49:01.599 align:start position:0%
training to be an airline pilot
 
00:49:02.950 --> 00:49:02.960 align:start position:0%
therefore that must be an allowable
 
00:49:05.430 --> 00:49:05.440 align:start position:0%
expense right and so we go back to the
 
00:49:07.109 --> 00:49:07.119 align:start position:0%
law and the statute which clearly
 
00:49:09.589 --> 00:49:09.599 align:start position:0%
enumerates and says here's what you can
 
00:49:11.829 --> 00:49:11.839 align:start position:0%
spend it on as opposed to trying to
 
00:49:13.510 --> 00:49:13.520 align:start position:0%
enumerate all the things you can't spend
 
00:49:15.910 --> 00:49:15.920 align:start position:0%
it on and so in that affirmative
 
00:49:18.309 --> 00:49:18.319 align:start position:0%
argument we provide clarity to
 
00:49:20.309 --> 00:49:20.319 align:start position:0%
um you know all of our constituents who
 
00:49:21.750 --> 00:49:21.760 align:start position:0%
are going to have to apply this does it
 
00:49:23.270 --> 00:49:23.280 align:start position:0%
fit into one of these categories on the
 
00:49:24.870 --> 00:49:24.880 align:start position:0%
list if so then you're all set and
 
00:49:27.829 --> 00:49:27.839 align:start position:0%
you're good to go and so we think that
 
00:49:30.069 --> 00:49:30.079 align:start position:0%
picking one item that would be
 
00:49:32.230 --> 00:49:32.240 align:start position:0%
disallowed and quite frankly an item
 
00:49:33.910 --> 00:49:33.920 align:start position:0%
that's disallowed and fairly
 
00:49:36.230 --> 00:49:36.240 align:start position:0%
ubiquitously understood is you know
 
00:49:38.309 --> 00:49:38.319 align:start position:0%
through the constitutional uh activities
 
00:49:39.829 --> 00:49:39.839 align:start position:0%
that have taken place that we create
 
00:49:42.069 --> 00:49:42.079 align:start position:0%
confusion for those same families rather
 
00:49:43.190 --> 00:49:43.200 align:start position:0%
than saying here's what you
 
00:49:44.470 --> 00:49:44.480 align:start position:0%
affirmatively can
 
00:49:46.150 --> 00:49:46.160 align:start position:0%
adopt i would i would just agree that
 
00:49:47.990 --> 00:49:48.000 align:start position:0%
it's ubiquitously understood by the
 
00:49:50.710 --> 00:49:50.720 align:start position:0%
public attorney moral and um
 
00:49:52.069 --> 00:49:52.079 align:start position:0%
i don't think this requires an
 
00:49:55.750 --> 00:49:55.760 align:start position:0%
exhaustive list or a treaty treatise on
 
00:49:58.390 --> 00:49:58.400 align:start position:0%
what cannot be included i mean
 
00:50:02.390 --> 00:50:02.400 align:start position:0%
if you look at not just o in 194 f2 but
 
00:50:04.390 --> 00:50:04.400 align:start position:0%
all of 194
 
00:50:04.400 --> 00:50:05.270 align:start position:0%
all of 194
f

00:50:05.270 --> 00:50:05.280 align:start position:0%
f
 
00:50:07.510 --> 00:50:07.520 align:start position:0%
2 a through o
 
00:50:08.950 --> 00:50:08.960 align:start position:0%
you can look at things that says
 
00:50:12.069 --> 00:50:12.079 align:start position:0%
curricular instructional materials
 
00:50:12.079 --> 00:50:14.150 align:start position:0%
curricular instructional materials
programs

00:50:14.150 --> 00:50:14.160 align:start position:0%
programs
 
00:50:16.549 --> 00:50:16.559 align:start position:0%
and we know that the large majority of
 
00:50:18.710 --> 00:50:18.720 align:start position:0%
the funds the education no not the funds
 
00:50:21.270 --> 00:50:21.280 align:start position:0%
but the educational providers our
 
00:50:22.790 --> 00:50:22.800 align:start position:0%
religious schools
 
00:50:24.870 --> 00:50:24.880 align:start position:0%
so reading that list
 
00:50:26.950 --> 00:50:26.960 align:start position:0%
and not being a lawyer there's no reason
 
00:50:29.750 --> 00:50:29.760 align:start position:0%
that they wouldn't think that they could
 
00:50:31.750 --> 00:50:31.760 align:start position:0%
use the funds towards educational
 
00:50:31.760 --> 00:50:33.109 align:start position:0%
use the funds towards educational
instruction

00:50:33.109 --> 00:50:33.119 align:start position:0%
instruction
 
00:50:35.349 --> 00:50:35.359 align:start position:0%
it would be a very simple fix and i
 
00:50:37.030 --> 00:50:37.040 align:start position:0%
don't think it's going to open pandora's
 
00:50:40.390 --> 00:50:40.400 align:start position:0%
box to well you didn't say this so we
 
00:50:44.150 --> 00:50:44.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:45.990 --> 00:50:46.000 align:start position:0%
so if i might just respond to that and
 
00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:47.589 align:start position:0%
so if i might just respond to that and
then

00:50:47.589 --> 00:50:47.599 align:start position:0%
then
 
00:50:48.470 --> 00:50:48.480 align:start position:0%
you know the other thing that you have
 
00:50:50.710 --> 00:50:50.720 align:start position:0%
to consider is the application of that
 
00:50:52.470 --> 00:50:52.480 align:start position:0%
too because these
 
00:50:56.069 --> 00:50:56.079 align:start position:0%
funds are prohibited from
 
00:50:58.950 --> 00:50:58.960 align:start position:0%
being used for religious instruction
 
00:51:01.030 --> 00:51:01.040 align:start position:0%
so i have many of my public schools
 
00:51:03.109 --> 00:51:03.119 align:start position:0%
today who offer world religion classes
 
00:51:04.549 --> 00:51:04.559 align:start position:0%
right and they're studying hinduism and
 
00:51:07.589 --> 00:51:07.599 align:start position:0%
buddhism christianity and judaism and so
 
00:51:09.829 --> 00:51:09.839 align:start position:0%
that is that to be considered religious
 
00:51:12.150 --> 00:51:12.160 align:start position:0%
instruction because they have uh looked
 
00:51:14.390 --> 00:51:14.400 align:start position:0%
at that no and so one of the and i think
 
00:51:16.390 --> 00:51:16.400 align:start position:0%
we would all readily agree on that and
 
00:51:19.109 --> 00:51:19.119 align:start position:0%
so again we are very clear in terms of
 
00:51:20.950 --> 00:51:20.960 align:start position:0%
what's enumerated in terms of what's
 
00:51:22.950 --> 00:51:22.960 align:start position:0%
permissible and
 
00:51:25.670 --> 00:51:25.680 align:start position:0%
religious instruction is prohibited and
 
00:51:27.349 --> 00:51:27.359 align:start position:0%
that's prohibited by the constitution so
 
00:51:30.309 --> 00:51:30.319 align:start position:0%
that's how we see that
 
00:51:33.030 --> 00:51:33.040 align:start position:0%
representative ruler thank you
 
00:51:34.549 --> 00:51:34.559 align:start position:0%
well i happen to agree with the two
 
00:51:37.190 --> 00:51:37.200 align:start position:0%
people sitting on either side of me
 
00:51:39.910 --> 00:51:39.920 align:start position:0%
i do not think that there is a problem
 
00:51:41.670 --> 00:51:41.680 align:start position:0%
being very clear
 
00:51:43.990 --> 00:51:44.000 align:start position:0%
when there is an issue
 
00:51:45.990 --> 00:51:46.000 align:start position:0%
even here in this room
 
00:51:47.430 --> 00:51:47.440 align:start position:0%
that is
 
00:51:49.510 --> 00:51:49.520 align:start position:0%
religious in nature
 
00:51:51.990 --> 00:51:52.000 align:start position:0%
we can make it because we all are
 
00:51:53.670 --> 00:51:53.680 align:start position:0%
wardsmiths here
 
00:51:55.910 --> 00:51:55.920 align:start position:0%
so that it is very clear
 
00:51:58.950 --> 00:51:58.960 align:start position:0%
that religious instruction
 
00:52:00.710 --> 00:52:00.720 align:start position:0%
is prohibited
 
00:52:02.710 --> 00:52:02.720 align:start position:0%
now we can define
 
00:52:05.030 --> 00:52:05.040 align:start position:0%
instruction if you'd like
 
00:52:06.710 --> 00:52:06.720 align:start position:0%
but i agree that we need to have
 
00:52:09.349 --> 00:52:09.359 align:start position:0%
something put in here because i'm a
 
00:52:13.109 --> 00:52:13.119 align:start position:0%
lawyer and i don't know what that is so
 
00:52:15.430 --> 00:52:15.440 align:start position:0%
i don't think it's as clear in all due
 
00:52:15.440 --> 00:52:16.870 align:start position:0%
i don't think it's as clear in all due
respect

00:52:16.870 --> 00:52:16.880 align:start position:0%
respect
 
00:52:21.190 --> 00:52:21.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:23.510 --> 00:52:23.520 align:start position:0%
well you know senator whitley asked for
 
00:52:25.190 --> 00:52:25.200 align:start position:0%
a clarification of whether funds are
 
00:52:27.190 --> 00:52:27.200 align:start position:0%
going to religious schools right now
 
00:52:30.390 --> 00:52:30.400 align:start position:0%
it would be unconstitutional if school
 
00:52:32.230 --> 00:52:32.240 align:start position:0%
if we were to if the department were to
 
00:52:33.430 --> 00:52:33.440 align:start position:0%
have taken this law and said well we
 
00:52:34.790 --> 00:52:34.800 align:start position:0%
aren't going to let any of these funds
 
00:52:36.870 --> 00:52:36.880 align:start position:0%
go to religious schools
 
00:52:36.880 --> 00:52:37.670 align:start position:0%
go to religious schools
that

00:52:37.670 --> 00:52:37.680 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:52:40.230 --> 00:52:40.240 align:start position:0%
itself would be unconstitutional so
 
00:52:42.309 --> 00:52:42.319 align:start position:0%
there are the constitutional
 
00:52:45.109 --> 00:52:45.119 align:start position:0%
issues here are fairly complex there and
 
00:52:47.990 --> 00:52:48.000 align:start position:0%
the the case law that uh the aclu relied
 
00:52:49.670 --> 00:52:49.680 align:start position:0%
on in their letter the carson case
 
00:52:51.190 --> 00:52:51.200 align:start position:0%
that's currently in front of the supreme
 
00:52:53.670 --> 00:52:53.680 align:start position:0%
court the this you know has the
 
00:52:55.190 --> 00:52:55.200 align:start position:0%
potential to be a somewhat changing
 
00:52:58.390 --> 00:52:58.400 align:start position:0%
landscape and uh the issues are complex
 
00:53:00.549 --> 00:53:00.559 align:start position:0%
enough that it's not
 
00:53:03.030 --> 00:53:03.040 align:start position:0%
in the department's view it's not
 
00:53:05.670 --> 00:53:05.680 align:start position:0%
simple to to simply
 
00:53:07.589 --> 00:53:07.599 align:start position:0%
make a categorical
 
00:53:07.599 --> 00:53:08.390 align:start position:0%
make a categorical
uh

00:53:08.390 --> 00:53:08.400 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:53:11.109 --> 00:53:11.119 align:start position:0%
uh constitutional explanation in there
 
00:53:13.750 --> 00:53:13.760 align:start position:0%
given the case-by-case nature of these
 
00:53:15.349 --> 00:53:15.359 align:start position:0%
expenditures like for example the
 
00:53:17.109 --> 00:53:17.119 align:start position:0%
commissioner was leaning into world lang
 
00:53:19.190 --> 00:53:19.200 align:start position:0%
world religion classes that maybe teach
 
00:53:20.390 --> 00:53:20.400 align:start position:0%
about a religion which would not
 
00:53:22.390 --> 00:53:22.400 align:start position:0%
constitute religious instruction
 
00:53:24.230 --> 00:53:24.240 align:start position:0%
as we've talked about with the neces the
 
00:53:25.589 --> 00:53:25.599 align:start position:0%
necessity of the catch-all that the
 
00:53:27.510 --> 00:53:27.520 align:start position:0%
legislature decided was needed to
 
00:53:29.670 --> 00:53:29.680 align:start position:0%
implement this
 
00:53:32.309 --> 00:53:32.319 align:start position:0%
there could be circumstances that come
 
00:53:34.150 --> 00:53:34.160 align:start position:0%
before the scholarship committee or the
 
00:53:36.230 --> 00:53:36.240 align:start position:0%
scholarship organization
 
00:53:38.230 --> 00:53:38.240 align:start position:0%
that straddle these lines these free
 
00:53:40.870 --> 00:53:40.880 align:start position:0%
exercise and um
 
00:53:42.870 --> 00:53:42.880 align:start position:0%
establishment clause lines that are
 
00:53:45.109 --> 00:53:45.119 align:start position:0%
still still in some cases emerging and
 
00:53:46.549 --> 00:53:46.559 align:start position:0%
sometimes very complicated you've got
 
00:53:49.109 --> 00:53:49.119 align:start position:0%
cases like lock versus davie and the
 
00:53:51.510 --> 00:53:51.520 align:start position:0%
carson case and the espinoza case and
 
00:53:54.309 --> 00:53:54.319 align:start position:0%
you know it's just it
 
00:53:56.230 --> 00:53:56.240 align:start position:0%
given that the department is clear is
 
00:53:57.829 --> 00:53:57.839 align:start position:0%
clear with a scholarship organization
 
00:53:59.430 --> 00:53:59.440 align:start position:0%
that funds cannot be used for religious
 
00:54:02.230 --> 00:54:02.240 align:start position:0%
instruction we think it would uh it's
 
00:54:03.990 --> 00:54:04.000 align:start position:0%
unnecessarily redundant to include that
 
00:54:05.829 --> 00:54:05.839 align:start position:0%
language in here and if we were to
 
00:54:07.910 --> 00:54:07.920 align:start position:0%
include it it could cause confusion in
 
00:54:09.349 --> 00:54:09.359 align:start position:0%
the other direction it could it could
 
00:54:11.190 --> 00:54:11.200 align:start position:0%
cause people to think well i can't use
 
00:54:12.950 --> 00:54:12.960 align:start position:0%
this fund for a religious in at a
 
00:54:15.030 --> 00:54:15.040 align:start position:0%
religious institution um and that would
 
00:54:16.230 --> 00:54:16.240 align:start position:0%
have its own constitutional
 
00:54:18.150 --> 00:54:18.160 align:start position:0%
ramifications so we just think there's
 
00:54:20.710 --> 00:54:20.720 align:start position:0%
the potential to create more confusion
 
00:54:22.309 --> 00:54:22.319 align:start position:0%
and i guess i would just like add one
 
00:54:25.030 --> 00:54:25.040 align:start position:0%
more thing to that is that we have not
 
00:54:27.430 --> 00:54:27.440 align:start position:0%
mitigated by not including that language
 
00:54:29.910 --> 00:54:29.920 align:start position:0%
in this law the aclu or anyone else's
 
00:54:32.309 --> 00:54:32.319 align:start position:0%
opportunity if they believe that
 
00:54:34.230 --> 00:54:34.240 align:start position:0%
uh you know for example a religious
 
00:54:35.750 --> 00:54:35.760 align:start position:0%
school that's receiving funds from this
 
00:54:37.990 --> 00:54:38.000 align:start position:0%
is violating the constitution by using
 
00:54:39.670 --> 00:54:39.680 align:start position:0%
these funds for
 
00:54:41.670 --> 00:54:41.680 align:start position:0%
uh you know religious instruction they
 
00:54:44.309 --> 00:54:44.319 align:start position:0%
have the ability to uh pursue that
 
00:54:46.150 --> 00:54:46.160 align:start position:0%
constitutional claim against that entity
 
00:54:47.430 --> 00:54:47.440 align:start position:0%
so we you know
 
00:54:50.069 --> 00:54:50.079 align:start position:0%
to to attorney bond's point you know
 
00:54:51.349 --> 00:54:51.359 align:start position:0%
this is
 
00:54:54.150 --> 00:54:54.160 align:start position:0%
as as word smithy as we can be it's not
 
00:54:56.470 --> 00:54:56.480 align:start position:0%
a clear-cut thing and it is a dynamic
 
00:54:58.150 --> 00:54:58.160 align:start position:0%
landscape and so we have to be careful
 
00:54:59.750 --> 00:54:59.760 align:start position:0%
that we don't set ourselves up to create
 
00:55:02.950 --> 00:55:02.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:05.270 --> 00:55:05.280 align:start position:0%
representative mcguire yes thank you i'd
 
00:55:07.829 --> 00:55:07.839 align:start position:0%
like to move to approve this rule
 
00:55:09.829 --> 00:55:09.839 align:start position:0%
with the
 
00:55:12.789 --> 00:55:12.799 align:start position:0%
request that the department work with
 
00:55:15.030 --> 00:55:15.040 align:start position:0%
the legislature regarding
 
00:55:16.870 --> 00:55:16.880 align:start position:0%
the legislative issues that have that
 
00:55:18.630 --> 00:55:18.640 align:start position:0%
have been noted
 
00:55:21.190 --> 00:55:21.200 align:start position:0%
and also the large number of bills in in
 
00:55:23.829 --> 00:55:23.839 align:start position:0%
process and also that the department
 
00:55:23.839 --> 00:55:24.950 align:start position:0%
process and also that the department
report

00:55:24.950 --> 00:55:24.960 align:start position:0%
report
 
00:55:26.069 --> 00:55:26.079 align:start position:0%
to the
 
00:55:28.390 --> 00:55:28.400 align:start position:0%
edge to the legislature
 
00:55:28.400 --> 00:55:29.349 align:start position:0%
edge to the legislature
on

00:55:29.349 --> 00:55:29.359 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:55:33.270 --> 00:55:33.280 align:start position:0%
in more detail on the issue of
 
00:55:35.829 --> 00:55:35.839 align:start position:0%
religious instruction because
 
00:55:38.549 --> 00:55:38.559 align:start position:0%
i don't unlike representative roulard i
 
00:55:40.549 --> 00:55:40.559 align:start position:0%
don't think we can
 
00:55:43.510 --> 00:55:43.520 align:start position:0%
today give you a
 
00:55:45.430 --> 00:55:45.440 align:start position:0%
some language that you could insert into
 
00:55:49.750 --> 00:55:49.760 align:start position:0%
the rule um i'll second that motion
 
00:55:53.510 --> 00:55:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:55.190 --> 00:55:55.200 align:start position:0%
representative lang to speak to the
 
00:55:55.200 --> 00:55:56.470 align:start position:0%
representative lang to speak to the
motion

00:55:56.470 --> 00:55:56.480 align:start position:0%
motion
 
00:55:57.349 --> 00:55:57.359 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:55:58.950 --> 00:55:58.960 align:start position:0%
just to speak to the religious aspect i
 
00:56:01.270 --> 00:56:01.280 align:start position:0%
i agree i think for me you're gonna
 
00:56:03.589 --> 00:56:03.599 align:start position:0%
catch 22. i think if you put down
 
00:56:05.109 --> 00:56:05.119 align:start position:0%
something about religious instruction
 
00:56:06.390 --> 00:56:06.400 align:start position:0%
then people are going to automatically
 
00:56:07.910 --> 00:56:07.920 align:start position:0%
assume you can't go to religious school
 
00:56:10.150 --> 00:56:10.160 align:start position:0%
without understanding what that law
 
00:56:11.589 --> 00:56:11.599 align:start position:0%
particularly means when you use that
 
00:56:14.069 --> 00:56:14.079 align:start position:0%
phrase religious instruction so i think
 
00:56:15.510 --> 00:56:15.520 align:start position:0%
you're in a really tough spot to try to
 
00:56:17.430 --> 00:56:17.440 align:start position:0%
define that but i probably need to make
 
00:56:19.109 --> 00:56:19.119 align:start position:0%
a best guess effort and see try to do
 
00:56:20.309 --> 00:56:20.319 align:start position:0%
something like that
 
00:56:22.309 --> 00:56:22.319 align:start position:0%
i just think we're confusing the idea of
 
00:56:23.750 --> 00:56:23.760 align:start position:0%
religious schools with religious
 
00:56:25.510 --> 00:56:25.520 align:start position:0%
instruction and those are getting
 
00:56:27.829 --> 00:56:27.839 align:start position:0%
complicated together and we allow the
 
00:56:29.430 --> 00:56:29.440 align:start position:0%
use for religious schools we don't allow
 
00:56:30.870 --> 00:56:30.880 align:start position:0%
the use of religious instruction and
 
00:56:34.230 --> 00:56:34.240 align:start position:0%
trying to define that's a great try but
 
00:56:36.069 --> 00:56:36.079 align:start position:0%
i agree that the rules should be adopted
 
00:56:37.510 --> 00:56:37.520 align:start position:0%
as it's written now and you should work
 
00:56:38.630 --> 00:56:38.640 align:start position:0%
with the legislature to see if there's
 
00:56:40.309 --> 00:56:40.319 align:start position:0%
something we can do to clarify that in
 
00:56:42.390 --> 00:56:42.400 align:start position:0%
the future
 
00:56:45.829 --> 00:56:45.839 align:start position:0%
okay we have a motion to
 
00:56:48.069 --> 00:56:48.079 align:start position:0%
conditionally approve the discussion
 
00:56:51.589 --> 00:56:51.599 align:start position:0%
representative tucker thank you i served
 
00:56:53.670 --> 00:56:53.680 align:start position:0%
nine years on the wellesley
 
00:56:55.990 --> 00:56:56.000 align:start position:0%
massachusetts school board
 
00:56:57.990 --> 00:56:58.000 align:start position:0%
my children most of the time attended
 
00:56:59.589 --> 00:56:59.599 align:start position:0%
that public school
 
00:57:01.349 --> 00:57:01.359 align:start position:0%
so i am very familiar with the
 
00:57:01.359 --> 00:57:02.710 align:start position:0%
so i am very familiar with the
difficulties

00:57:02.710 --> 00:57:02.720 align:start position:0%
difficulties
 
00:57:05.589 --> 00:57:05.599 align:start position:0%
of coming up with
 
00:57:08.230 --> 00:57:08.240 align:start position:0%
how to deal with this whole topic
 
00:57:10.549 --> 00:57:10.559 align:start position:0%
and in wellesley
 
00:57:12.309 --> 00:57:12.319 align:start position:0%
they had a two-year course social
 
00:57:14.870 --> 00:57:14.880 align:start position:0%
studies course which i called the roots
 
00:57:17.510 --> 00:57:17.520 align:start position:0%
of western civilization
 
00:57:21.270 --> 00:57:21.280 align:start position:0%
and it had some other bland name
 
00:57:23.670 --> 00:57:23.680 align:start position:0%
and we skipped that we went from greece
 
00:57:25.910 --> 00:57:25.920 align:start position:0%
and rome egypt you know the ancient
 
00:57:25.920 --> 00:57:27.829 align:start position:0%
and rome egypt you know the ancient
civilizations

00:57:27.829 --> 00:57:27.839 align:start position:0%
civilizations
 
00:57:30.230 --> 00:57:30.240 align:start position:0%
right through
 
00:57:32.230 --> 00:57:32.240 align:start position:0%
the dark ages
 
00:57:34.549 --> 00:57:34.559 align:start position:0%
and then we skipped the reformation and
 
00:57:35.990 --> 00:57:36.000 align:start position:0%
the renaissance
 
00:57:37.829 --> 00:57:37.839 align:start position:0%
and they picked up at the french
 
00:57:37.839 --> 00:57:39.510 align:start position:0%
and they picked up at the french
revolution

00:57:39.510 --> 00:57:39.520 align:start position:0%
revolution
 
00:57:39.520 --> 00:57:40.630 align:start position:0%
revolution
because

00:57:40.630 --> 00:57:40.640 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:57:42.630 --> 00:57:42.640 align:start position:0%
the town was
 
00:57:44.870 --> 00:57:44.880 align:start position:0%
primarily christian but
 
00:57:47.750 --> 00:57:47.760 align:start position:0%
many were roman catholic many were not
 
00:57:50.470 --> 00:57:50.480 align:start position:0%
and so this whole topic
 
00:57:53.589 --> 00:57:53.599 align:start position:0%
of study versus instruction
 
00:57:56.870 --> 00:57:56.880 align:start position:0%
i think really does need to be worked on
 
00:57:59.030 --> 00:57:59.040 align:start position:0%
because it affects
 
00:58:01.190 --> 00:58:01.200 align:start position:0%
what is included
 
00:58:01.200 --> 00:58:02.630 align:start position:0%
what is included
in

00:58:02.630 --> 00:58:02.640 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:58:05.270 --> 00:58:05.280 align:start position:0%
the curriculum
 
00:58:07.670 --> 00:58:07.680 align:start position:0%
those children who left out a thousand
 
00:58:07.680 --> 00:58:09.190 align:start position:0%
those children who left out a thousand
years

00:58:09.190 --> 00:58:09.200 align:start position:0%
years
 
00:58:11.270 --> 00:58:11.280 align:start position:0%
of western civilization
 
00:58:13.670 --> 00:58:13.680 align:start position:0%
were not as educated as they should have
 
00:58:13.680 --> 00:58:14.630 align:start position:0%
were not as educated as they should have
been

00:58:14.630 --> 00:58:14.640 align:start position:0%
been
 
00:58:17.829 --> 00:58:17.839 align:start position:0%
so i think it is i'm happy to support
 
00:58:17.839 --> 00:58:18.870 align:start position:0%
so i think it is i'm happy to support
your

00:58:18.870 --> 00:58:18.880 align:start position:0%
your
 
00:58:20.870 --> 00:58:20.880 align:start position:0%
emotions if
 
00:58:22.549 --> 00:58:22.559 align:start position:0%
when you repeat it
 
00:58:24.230 --> 00:58:24.240 align:start position:0%
can make sure that it includes a
 
00:58:27.270 --> 00:58:27.280 align:start position:0%
definition or instruction or work on
 
00:58:33.349 --> 00:58:33.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:35.030 --> 00:58:35.040 align:start position:0%
senator whitley
 
00:58:37.910 --> 00:58:37.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i certainly cannot
 
00:58:40.630 --> 00:58:40.640 align:start position:0%
support that motion i think that you
 
00:58:43.349 --> 00:58:43.359 align:start position:0%
know we joker has an obligation
 
00:58:45.349 --> 00:58:45.359 align:start position:0%
in reviewing
 
00:58:48.150 --> 00:58:48.160 align:start position:0%
in reviewing these rules um
 
00:58:48.160 --> 00:58:48.950 align:start position:0%
in reviewing these rules um
to

00:58:48.950 --> 00:58:48.960 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:58:49.910 --> 00:58:49.920 align:start position:0%
i think
 
00:58:52.309 --> 00:58:52.319 align:start position:0%
importantly make sure that we don't
 
00:58:55.270 --> 00:58:55.280 align:start position:0%
violate the public's trust by allowing
 
00:58:58.230 --> 00:58:58.240 align:start position:0%
uh a program with so many questions to
 
00:59:00.390 --> 00:59:00.400 align:start position:0%
be implemented particularly when it
 
00:59:03.349 --> 00:59:03.359 align:start position:0%
comes to our scarce and precious
 
00:59:05.349 --> 00:59:05.359 align:start position:0%
taxpayer dollars
 
00:59:07.109 --> 00:59:07.119 align:start position:0%
you know the committee can you know
 
00:59:08.870 --> 00:59:08.880 align:start position:0%
looking at the potential objections in
 
00:59:13.030 --> 00:59:13.040 align:start position:0%
rsa 541 a 13-4 there are four bases for
 
00:59:15.510 --> 00:59:15.520 align:start position:0%
objection and i think we have
 
00:59:17.589 --> 00:59:17.599 align:start position:0%
heard ample testimony from what we've
 
00:59:19.990 --> 00:59:20.000 align:start position:0%
received from the aclu from drum and
 
00:59:22.789 --> 00:59:22.799 align:start position:0%
woodson from a whole host of other folks
 
00:59:25.750 --> 00:59:25.760 align:start position:0%
from the jalcar staff you know i
 
00:59:29.109 --> 00:59:29.119 align:start position:0%
i believe that the gel car staff
 
00:59:32.230 --> 00:59:32.240 align:start position:0%
take an impartial look at every rule and
 
00:59:34.470 --> 00:59:34.480 align:start position:0%
i and i respect them deeply and they
 
00:59:37.109 --> 00:59:37.119 align:start position:0%
have pointed out to us a whole host of
 
00:59:39.990 --> 00:59:40.000 align:start position:0%
concerns and so i think there are four
 
00:59:42.789 --> 00:59:42.799 align:start position:0%
bases for an objection for this rule you
 
00:59:44.390 --> 00:59:44.400 align:start position:0%
know and i think of course you know we
 
00:59:45.829 --> 00:59:45.839 align:start position:0%
talk about this a lot in gel car
 
00:59:47.910 --> 00:59:47.920 align:start position:0%
regardless of your policy position on
 
00:59:50.390 --> 00:59:50.400 align:start position:0%
the actual program we're done with that
 
00:59:52.230 --> 00:59:52.240 align:start position:0%
but we have an obligation
 
00:59:53.430 --> 00:59:53.440 align:start position:0%
right to
 
00:59:55.990 --> 00:59:56.000 align:start position:0%
to look at at this rule making make sure
 
00:59:57.430 --> 00:59:57.440 align:start position:0%
that it complies
 
00:59:59.990 --> 01:00:00.000 align:start position:0%
uh right that's not in um that it
 
01:00:01.349 --> 01:00:01.359 align:start position:0%
doesn't violate public interest that
 
01:00:02.789 --> 01:00:02.799 align:start position:0%
it's not contrary to the intent of the
 
01:00:04.309 --> 01:00:04.319 align:start position:0%
legislature that it's beyond the scope
 
01:00:06.870 --> 01:00:06.880 align:start position:0%
of the agency and on that latter point
 
01:00:08.630 --> 01:00:08.640 align:start position:0%
beyond the scope beyond the authority of
 
01:00:10.549 --> 01:00:10.559 align:start position:0%
the scope of the agency we heard from
 
01:00:13.990 --> 01:00:14.000 align:start position:0%
jal carr staff right that there is not
 
01:00:15.910 --> 01:00:15.920 align:start position:0%
adequate criteria for the scholarship
 
01:00:17.910 --> 01:00:17.920 align:start position:0%
organization to adjudicate where the
 
01:00:19.670 --> 01:00:19.680 align:start position:0%
expense is eligible i mean i think this
 
01:00:22.470 --> 01:00:22.480 align:start position:0%
is this raises a significant question
 
01:00:23.750 --> 01:00:23.760 align:start position:0%
about the breadth and scope of the
 
01:00:25.430 --> 01:00:25.440 align:start position:0%
scholarships role and authority to
 
01:00:27.670 --> 01:00:27.680 align:start position:0%
manage public funds and that the
 
01:00:29.750 --> 01:00:29.760 align:start position:0%
delegation of authority to the
 
01:00:32.630 --> 01:00:32.640 align:start position:0%
scholarship organization is very
 
01:00:35.349 --> 01:00:35.359 align:start position:0%
problematic and then i think the
 
01:00:37.430 --> 01:00:37.440 align:start position:0%
not adding a simple sentence into the
 
01:00:39.270 --> 01:00:39.280 align:start position:0%
rule that funds received by a school
 
01:00:41.589 --> 01:00:41.599 align:start position:0%
under this program shall not be used for
 
01:00:44.390 --> 01:00:44.400 align:start position:0%
religious instruction a very simple
 
01:00:47.190 --> 01:00:47.200 align:start position:0%
sentence to clarify how public funds are
 
01:00:48.630 --> 01:00:48.640 align:start position:0%
going to be used to
 
01:00:50.789 --> 01:00:50.799 align:start position:0%
to show the public that we are doing our
 
01:00:52.470 --> 01:00:52.480 align:start position:0%
due diligence to not violate the
 
01:00:55.670 --> 01:00:55.680 align:start position:0%
constitution that is a simple fix and
 
01:00:57.109 --> 01:00:57.119 align:start position:0%
you know without that there's no way
 
01:00:58.630 --> 01:00:58.640 align:start position:0%
that i could support an approval thank
 
01:00:58.640 --> 01:01:02.309 align:start position:0%
that i could support an approval thank
you

01:01:02.309 --> 01:01:02.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:02.319 --> 01:01:03.750 align:start position:0%
 
diane

01:01:03.750 --> 01:01:03.760 align:start position:0%
diane
 
01:01:05.829 --> 01:01:05.839 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um
 
01:01:08.150 --> 01:01:08.160 align:start position:0%
i basically agree with representative
 
01:01:10.950 --> 01:01:10.960 align:start position:0%
ruriart and senator whitley i i don't
 
01:01:12.710 --> 01:01:12.720 align:start position:0%
feel that i can support this at this
 
01:01:15.270 --> 01:01:15.280 align:start position:0%
time i think it still needs work thank
 
01:01:15.280 --> 01:01:16.390 align:start position:0%
time i think it still needs work thank
you

01:01:16.390 --> 01:01:16.400 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:01:19.910 --> 01:01:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:21.589 --> 01:01:21.599 align:start position:0%
mike can you give us tell us what the
 
01:01:25.990 --> 01:01:26.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:28.069 --> 01:01:28.079 align:start position:0%
approval with recommendation that the
 
01:01:29.670 --> 01:01:29.680 align:start position:0%
agency work with the
 
01:01:29.680 --> 01:01:31.589 align:start position:0%
agency work with the
legislature

01:01:31.589 --> 01:01:31.599 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
01:01:34.230 --> 01:01:34.240 align:start position:0%
to resolve issues and to work on the
 
01:01:36.789 --> 01:01:36.799 align:start position:0%
outstanding legislation
 
01:01:38.870 --> 01:01:38.880 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure if i captured that entirely
 
01:01:38.880 --> 01:01:40.309 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure if i captured that entirely
or

01:01:40.309 --> 01:01:40.319 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:01:42.150 --> 01:01:42.160 align:start position:0%
there was also the caveat that they
 
01:01:43.670 --> 01:01:43.680 align:start position:0%
report to us
 
01:01:45.750 --> 01:01:45.760 align:start position:0%
on how they implement
 
01:01:47.750 --> 01:01:47.760 align:start position:0%
the constitutional requirement to not
 
01:01:49.750 --> 01:01:49.760 align:start position:0%
fund religious instruction
 
01:01:49.760 --> 01:01:51.670 align:start position:0%

yes

01:02:38.549 --> 01:02:38.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:45.829 --> 01:02:45.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:47.910 --> 01:02:47.920 align:start position:0%
and we have the item removed from the
 
01:02:54.230 --> 01:02:54.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:57.510 --> 01:02:57.520 align:start position:0%
this is uh 2021-117
 
01:02:57.520 --> 01:02:58.309 align:start position:0%
this is uh 2021-117
yes

01:02:58.309 --> 01:02:58.319 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:02:59.589 --> 01:02:59.599 align:start position:0%
it is
 
01:02:59.599 --> 01:03:00.950 align:start position:0%
it is
regarding

01:03:00.950 --> 01:03:00.960 align:start position:0%
regarding
 
01:03:03.349 --> 01:03:03.359 align:start position:0%
disbursement of child support payments
 
01:03:07.910 --> 01:03:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:10.630 --> 01:03:10.640 align:start position:0%
yes i pulled this for consent
 
01:03:13.750 --> 01:03:13.760 align:start position:0%
because when i read the cover letter
 
01:03:15.270 --> 01:03:15.280 align:start position:0%
it says
 
01:03:15.280 --> 01:03:16.549 align:start position:0%
it says
that

01:03:16.549 --> 01:03:16.559 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:03:19.109 --> 01:03:19.119 align:start position:0%
the provision is explicitly detailed in
 
01:03:21.589 --> 01:03:21.599 align:start position:0%
federal laws the department elected to
 
01:03:23.750 --> 01:03:23.760 align:start position:0%
remove this provision from the rule as
 
01:03:25.270 --> 01:03:25.280 align:start position:0%
it would prevent the department from
 
01:03:27.029 --> 01:03:27.039 align:start position:0%
having the ability to act on an
 
01:03:29.349 --> 01:03:29.359 align:start position:0%
immediate federal law or regulation
 
01:03:32.390 --> 01:03:32.400 align:start position:0%
change or waiver
 
01:03:34.870 --> 01:03:34.880 align:start position:0%
i have no objection to them implementing
 
01:03:36.789 --> 01:03:36.799 align:start position:0%
federal laws
 
01:03:38.549 --> 01:03:38.559 align:start position:0%
but we are
 
01:03:41.029 --> 01:03:41.039 align:start position:0%
we are constitutionally forbidden from
 
01:03:42.829 --> 01:03:42.839 align:start position:0%
accepting a
 
01:03:47.270 --> 01:03:47.280 align:start position:0%
change a federal rule without explicit
 
01:03:49.670 --> 01:03:49.680 align:start position:0%
vote of an elected body
 
01:03:51.109 --> 01:03:51.119 align:start position:0%
so therefore i
 
01:03:58.549 --> 01:03:58.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:00.230 --> 01:04:00.240 align:start position:0%
good morning um allison zeno
 
01:04:01.910 --> 01:04:01.920 align:start position:0%
administrator of the administrative
 
01:04:03.910 --> 01:04:03.920 align:start position:0%
rules units for the department of health
 
01:04:05.430 --> 01:04:05.440 align:start position:0%
and human services
 
01:04:07.750 --> 01:04:07.760 align:start position:0%
um i apologize the program experts are
 
01:04:10.069 --> 01:04:10.079 align:start position:0%
not here we did not expect this to be
 
01:04:13.190 --> 01:04:13.200 align:start position:0%
pulled off the consent calendar however
 
01:04:16.870 --> 01:04:16.880 align:start position:0%
i was able to speak with someone in the
 
01:04:17.990 --> 01:04:18.000 align:start position:0%
the unit
 
01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:19.270 align:start position:0%
the unit
and

01:04:19.270 --> 01:04:19.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:04:23.990 --> 01:04:24.000 align:start position:0%
if we add back in the federal regulation
 
01:04:25.829 --> 01:04:25.839 align:start position:0%
that explicitly
 
01:04:28.549 --> 01:04:28.559 align:start position:0%
allows the department to
 
01:04:31.029 --> 01:04:31.039 align:start position:0%
um hold this monies
 
01:04:36.230 --> 01:04:36.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:39.430 --> 01:04:39.440 align:start position:0%
yes that way we would be voting on a an
 
01:04:41.109 --> 01:04:41.119 align:start position:0%
explicit rule
 
01:04:44.549 --> 01:04:44.559 align:start position:0%
and not leaving it open for
 
01:04:46.630 --> 01:04:46.640 align:start position:0%
cms or whomever it is that writes this
 
01:04:49.750 --> 01:04:49.760 align:start position:0%
rule to change it without our approval
 
01:04:52.150 --> 01:04:52.160 align:start position:0%
which is what we don't allow
 
01:04:54.870 --> 01:04:54.880 align:start position:0%
which we do not have the authority to do
 
01:04:54.880 --> 01:04:56.069 align:start position:0%
which we do not have the authority to do
um

01:04:56.069 --> 01:04:56.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:04:57.670 --> 01:04:57.680 align:start position:0%
so my suggestion
 
01:04:59.430 --> 01:04:59.440 align:start position:0%
then would be
 
01:05:03.430 --> 01:05:03.440 align:start position:0%
to add back in an eye
 
01:05:04.630 --> 01:05:04.640 align:start position:0%
and then
 
01:05:06.390 --> 01:05:06.400 align:start position:0%
it would read something of the sorts
 
01:05:08.710 --> 01:05:08.720 align:start position:0%
intercepted federal tax refunds made to
 
01:05:08.720 --> 01:05:09.829 align:start position:0%
intercepted federal tax refunds made to
satisfy

01:05:09.829 --> 01:05:09.839 align:start position:0%
satisfy
 
01:05:12.710 --> 01:05:12.720 align:start position:0%
a non-for a debt that are associated
 
01:05:15.349 --> 01:05:15.359 align:start position:0%
with a joint tax return shall be held in
 
01:05:18.069 --> 01:05:18.079 align:start position:0%
accordance with 42 usc
 
01:05:18.079 --> 01:05:20.829 align:start position:0%
accordance with 42 usc
664

01:05:20.829 --> 01:05:20.839 align:start position:0%
664
 
01:05:23.990 --> 01:05:24.000 align:start position:0%
a3b we need a date
 
01:05:26.710 --> 01:05:26.720 align:start position:0%
we need a specific version of that that
 
01:05:30.069 --> 01:05:30.079 align:start position:0%
rule in order to approve it
 
01:05:31.670 --> 01:05:31.680 align:start position:0%
mike um
 
01:05:34.390 --> 01:05:34.400 align:start position:0%
i would have to say that depends if they
 
01:05:37.990 --> 01:05:38.000 align:start position:0%
are compelled to uh comply with a cfr
 
01:05:40.230 --> 01:05:40.240 align:start position:0%
like des for a lot of things
 
01:05:42.710 --> 01:05:42.720 align:start position:0%
then a data is not needed if they are
 
01:05:44.870 --> 01:05:44.880 align:start position:0%
choosing to comply with a cfr on their
 
01:05:49.349 --> 01:05:49.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:51.750 --> 01:05:51.760 align:start position:0%
the department is required um
 
01:05:53.750 --> 01:05:53.760 align:start position:0%
is required to abide by that and our
 
01:05:55.510 --> 01:05:55.520 align:start position:0%
rule actually stated
 
01:05:59.190 --> 01:05:59.200 align:start position:0%
that the department was required to hold
 
01:06:01.750 --> 01:06:01.760 align:start position:0%
for six months but the actual the
 
01:06:05.349 --> 01:06:05.359 align:start position:0%
federal regulation had changed and it's
 
01:06:07.990 --> 01:06:08.000 align:start position:0%
not to exceed six months
 
01:06:11.029 --> 01:06:11.039 align:start position:0%
the unit then opted to
 
01:06:13.270 --> 01:06:13.280 align:start position:0%
just try to remove that from their rule
 
01:06:16.470 --> 01:06:16.480 align:start position:0%
altogether that way it would just
 
01:06:19.190 --> 01:06:19.200 align:start position:0%
default to the federal regulation
 
01:06:19.200 --> 01:06:20.309 align:start position:0%
default to the federal regulation
however

01:06:20.309 --> 01:06:20.319 align:start position:0%
however
 
01:06:23.349 --> 01:06:23.359 align:start position:0%
we i have authority to allow
 
01:06:26.390 --> 01:06:26.400 align:start position:0%
to put that back into the rule
 
01:06:26.400 --> 01:06:28.069 align:start position:0%
to put that back into the rule
mr

01:06:28.069 --> 01:06:28.079 align:start position:0%
mr
 
01:06:30.470 --> 01:06:30.480 align:start position:0%
but notwithstanding what i said if
 
01:06:31.990 --> 01:06:32.000 align:start position:0%
representative mcguire would like that
 
01:06:34.150 --> 01:06:34.160 align:start position:0%
language in there then
 
01:06:39.349 --> 01:06:39.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:41.990 --> 01:06:42.000 align:start position:0%
i would like to have it explicit and not
 
01:06:43.349 --> 01:06:43.359 align:start position:0%
leave it hanging
 
01:06:43.359 --> 01:06:44.710 align:start position:0%
leave it hanging
because

01:06:44.710 --> 01:06:44.720 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:06:46.789 --> 01:06:46.799 align:start position:0%
whether we're required to follow federal
 
01:06:49.430 --> 01:06:49.440 align:start position:0%
regulations or not
 
01:06:51.109 --> 01:06:51.119 align:start position:0%
they're not
 
01:06:56.549 --> 01:06:56.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:58.870 --> 01:06:58.880 align:start position:0%
allison could you send us that exact
 
01:07:03.910 --> 01:07:03.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:05.910 --> 01:07:05.920 align:start position:0%
so that would be an a conditional
 
01:07:08.390 --> 01:07:08.400 align:start position:0%
approval including that language
 
01:07:08.400 --> 01:07:10.630 align:start position:0%
approval including that language
correct

01:07:10.630 --> 01:07:10.640 align:start position:0%
correct
 
01:07:12.069 --> 01:07:12.079 align:start position:0%
so you've heard the motion any
 
01:07:15.349 --> 01:07:15.359 align:start position:0%
discussion from the committee
 
01:07:17.270 --> 01:07:17.280 align:start position:0%
seeing on all those in favor
 
01:07:17.280 --> 01:07:18.309 align:start position:0%
seeing on all those in favor
aye

01:07:18.309 --> 01:07:18.319 align:start position:0%
aye
 
01:07:18.319 --> 01:07:19.589 align:start position:0%
aye
opposed

01:07:19.589 --> 01:07:19.599 align:start position:0%
opposed
 
01:07:22.710 --> 01:07:22.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:24.069 --> 01:07:24.079 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry who made the motion and
 
01:07:24.079 --> 01:07:27.589 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry who made the motion and
seconded

01:07:27.589 --> 01:07:27.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:28.630 --> 01:07:28.640 align:start position:0%
i think
 
01:07:30.150 --> 01:07:30.160 align:start position:0%
i'll second it but i think carol made
 
01:07:34.069 --> 01:07:34.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:35.270 --> 01:07:35.280 align:start position:0%
so we'll try that again i'll make the
 
01:07:36.950 --> 01:07:36.960 align:start position:0%
motion mr chair that we are
 
01:07:38.789 --> 01:07:38.799 align:start position:0%
conditionally approved with the language
 
01:07:40.789 --> 01:07:40.799 align:start position:0%
uh as provided by the agency entered
 
01:07:44.549 --> 01:07:44.559 align:start position:0%
into the rule motion by lang second by
 
01:07:44.559 --> 01:07:50.309 align:start position:0%
into the rule motion by lang second by
gray

01:07:50.309 --> 01:07:50.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:53.750 --> 01:07:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:55.510 --> 01:07:55.520 align:start position:0%
so that was a motion to conditionally
 
01:07:57.430 --> 01:07:57.440 align:start position:0%
approve by lange to
 
01:07:59.910 --> 01:07:59.920 align:start position:0%
include a language from the agency and
 
01:08:02.789 --> 01:08:02.799 align:start position:0%
the second by grade
 
01:08:04.789 --> 01:08:04.799 align:start position:0%
you've heard the motion again
 
01:08:07.029 --> 01:08:07.039 align:start position:0%
all those in favor aye
 
01:08:07.039 --> 01:08:08.710 align:start position:0%
all those in favor aye
opposed

01:08:08.710 --> 01:08:08.720 align:start position:0%
opposed
 
01:08:12.069 --> 01:08:12.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:14.390 --> 01:08:14.400 align:start position:0%
is that all our business today
 
01:08:14.400 --> 01:08:15.510 align:start position:0%
is that all our business today
um

01:08:15.510 --> 01:08:15.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:17.030 --> 01:08:17.040 align:start position:0%
if you could hang on for a moment there
 
01:08:18.470 --> 01:08:18.480 align:start position:0%
are a couple things i'd like to bring up
 
01:08:20.470 --> 01:08:20.480 align:start position:0%
under other business
 
01:08:23.030 --> 01:08:23.040 align:start position:0%
okay we'll cancel a continue meeting
 
01:08:23.040 --> 01:08:26.309 align:start position:0%
okay we'll cancel a continue meeting
yeah

01:08:26.309 --> 01:08:26.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:28.070 --> 01:08:28.080 align:start position:0%
for the committee members
 
01:08:29.749 --> 01:08:29.759 align:start position:0%
on tuesday
 
01:08:32.390 --> 01:08:32.400 align:start position:0%
i staff met with
 
01:08:34.550 --> 01:08:34.560 align:start position:0%
the chair and the vice chair we do that
 
01:08:36.630 --> 01:08:36.640 align:start position:0%
every month before the jail car meeting
 
01:08:39.110 --> 01:08:39.120 align:start position:0%
to go over the agenda
 
01:08:41.349 --> 01:08:41.359 align:start position:0%
one of the items we discussed is a
 
01:08:44.070 --> 01:08:44.080 align:start position:0%
concern that over the last two years
 
01:08:45.590 --> 01:08:45.600 align:start position:0%
certainly since
 
01:08:49.749 --> 01:08:49.759 align:start position:0%
code started there has been almost a 50
 
01:08:52.630 --> 01:08:52.640 align:start position:0%
reduction in rule making
 
01:08:54.229 --> 01:08:54.239 align:start position:0%
that was probably understandable for a
 
01:08:57.990 --> 01:08:58.000 align:start position:0%
while but it seems to can be continuing
 
01:08:59.590 --> 01:08:59.600 align:start position:0%
and the chair and vice chair expressed a
 
01:08:59.600 --> 01:09:00.789 align:start position:0%
and the chair and vice chair expressed a
concern

01:09:00.789 --> 01:09:00.799 align:start position:0%
concern
 
01:09:02.550 --> 01:09:02.560 align:start position:0%
and we have
 
01:09:05.269 --> 01:09:05.279 align:start position:0%
just late yesterday gotten a report from
 
01:09:08.870 --> 01:09:08.880 align:start position:0%
it indicating what rules are expiring
 
01:09:12.709 --> 01:09:12.719 align:start position:0%
from 21 through 23. the reason being is
 
01:09:15.910 --> 01:09:15.920 align:start position:0%
in the fall of 2011 the law changed to
 
01:09:17.990 --> 01:09:18.000 align:start position:0%
make rules go from eight years to 10
 
01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:19.189 align:start position:0%
make rules go from eight years to 10
years

01:09:19.189 --> 01:09:19.199 align:start position:0%
years
 
01:09:20.709 --> 01:09:20.719 align:start position:0%
subsequent to that there was a lot of
 
01:09:22.149 --> 01:09:22.159 align:start position:0%
rule making over the next couple of
 
01:09:25.669 --> 01:09:25.679 align:start position:0%
years to get 10 10-year rules in place
 
01:09:26.870 --> 01:09:26.880 align:start position:0%
and a lot of those are going to be
 
01:09:26.880 --> 01:09:28.229 align:start position:0%
and a lot of those are going to be
expiring

01:09:28.229 --> 01:09:28.239 align:start position:0%
expiring
 
01:09:31.590 --> 01:09:31.600 align:start position:0%
this year and next year and the agencies
 
01:09:33.349 --> 01:09:33.359 align:start position:0%
do not seem to be
 
01:09:36.070 --> 01:09:36.080 align:start position:0%
picking up to take care of that so we
 
01:09:38.149 --> 01:09:38.159 align:start position:0%
are going to send out a letter after
 
01:09:40.229 --> 01:09:40.239 align:start position:0%
it's reviewed by the chair and vice
 
01:09:40.239 --> 01:09:41.510 align:start position:0%
it's reviewed by the chair and vice
chair

01:09:41.510 --> 01:09:41.520 align:start position:0%
chair
 
01:09:44.630 --> 01:09:44.640 align:start position:0%
to let people know about that
 
01:09:45.829 --> 01:09:45.839 align:start position:0%
the other thing
 
01:09:47.269 --> 01:09:47.279 align:start position:0%
i probably shouldn't have to mention
 
01:09:49.990 --> 01:09:50.000 align:start position:0%
maybe i don't but i will mention
 
01:09:51.590 --> 01:09:51.600 align:start position:0%
you've obviously all known that
 
01:09:53.590 --> 01:09:53.600 align:start position:0%
committee staff at every meeting is
 
01:09:55.990 --> 01:09:56.000 align:start position:0%
wearing face masks i just want to assure
 
01:09:57.590 --> 01:09:57.600 align:start position:0%
everybody that is not a political
 
01:09:59.990 --> 01:10:00.000 align:start position:0%
situation all three of the staff members
 
01:10:01.990 --> 01:10:02.000 align:start position:0%
staff lawyers have chronic medical
 
01:10:04.550 --> 01:10:04.560 align:start position:0%
conditions and it would make it to a
 
01:10:07.270 --> 01:10:07.280 align:start position:0%
various situation if serious situation
 
01:10:11.030 --> 01:10:11.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:15.750 --> 01:10:15.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:17.590 --> 01:10:17.600 align:start position:0%
any other items
 
01:10:20.950 --> 01:10:20.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:22.310 --> 01:10:22.320 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
01:10:22.320 --> 01:10:24.149 align:start position:0%
go ahead
so

01:10:24.149 --> 01:10:24.159 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:10:26.070 --> 01:10:26.080 align:start position:0%
maybe we ought to be thinking
 
01:10:27.350 --> 01:10:27.360 align:start position:0%
as a committee
 
01:10:29.270 --> 01:10:29.280 align:start position:0%
it's embarrassing for me as an alternate
 
01:10:31.669 --> 01:10:31.679 align:start position:0%
to be the one recommending it but some
 
01:10:33.510 --> 01:10:33.520 align:start position:0%
kind of extensions
 
01:10:34.950 --> 01:10:34.960 align:start position:0%
for certain
 
01:10:37.750 --> 01:10:37.760 align:start position:0%
agencies that are falling behind on
 
01:10:39.910 --> 01:10:39.920 align:start position:0%
getting things renewed there's process
 
01:10:42.310 --> 01:10:42.320 align:start position:0%
in place because what i understand
 
01:10:45.830 --> 01:10:45.840 align:start position:0%
sitting on ways and means we're hearing
 
01:10:47.990 --> 01:10:48.000 align:start position:0%
about bills
 
01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:49.669 align:start position:0%
about bills
where

01:10:49.669 --> 01:10:49.679 align:start position:0%
where
 
01:10:52.070 --> 01:10:52.080 align:start position:0%
apparently rules have not been able to
 
01:10:54.070 --> 01:10:54.080 align:start position:0%
keep up quickly
 
01:10:54.080 --> 01:10:54.950 align:start position:0%
keep up quickly
with

01:10:54.950 --> 01:10:54.960 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:10:57.189 --> 01:10:57.199 align:start position:0%
changing situations
 
01:10:59.830 --> 01:10:59.840 align:start position:0%
and and that i think comes first and the
 
01:11:02.229 --> 01:11:02.239 align:start position:0%
one i'm thinking of particularly
 
01:11:04.550 --> 01:11:04.560 align:start position:0%
has to do with
 
01:11:08.149 --> 01:11:08.159 align:start position:0%
allocations of
 
01:11:10.790 --> 01:11:10.800 align:start position:0%
monies received from
 
01:11:10.800 --> 01:11:12.870 align:start position:0%
monies received from
opioid

01:11:12.870 --> 01:11:12.880 align:start position:0%
opioid
 
01:11:16.229 --> 01:11:16.239 align:start position:0%
adjudications and settlements
 
01:11:16.239 --> 01:11:18.950 align:start position:0%
adjudications and settlements
and

01:11:18.950 --> 01:11:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:18.960 --> 01:11:19.830 align:start position:0%
 
it

01:11:19.830 --> 01:11:19.840 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:11:22.390 --> 01:11:22.400 align:start position:0%
is spoken of as you know money is
 
01:11:25.030 --> 01:11:25.040 align:start position:0%
sitting that could be used
 
01:11:27.189 --> 01:11:27.199 align:start position:0%
but the rules aren't
 
01:11:28.550 --> 01:11:28.560 align:start position:0%
haven't been
 
01:11:29.910 --> 01:11:29.920 align:start position:0%
worked out
 
01:11:31.830 --> 01:11:31.840 align:start position:0%
and and that's come up on a couple of
 
01:11:32.790 --> 01:11:32.800 align:start position:0%
others that
 
01:11:34.470 --> 01:11:34.480 align:start position:0%
offhand i can't
 
01:11:36.870 --> 01:11:36.880 align:start position:0%
think of what they were but
 
01:11:39.669 --> 01:11:39.679 align:start position:0%
as someone who's even associated as an
 
01:11:42.709 --> 01:11:42.719 align:start position:0%
alternate i don't like hearing this i
 
01:11:44.149 --> 01:11:44.159 align:start position:0%
think that
 
01:11:46.149 --> 01:11:46.159 align:start position:0%
new materials
 
01:11:49.669 --> 01:11:49.679 align:start position:0%
always should come before extensions
 
01:11:52.870 --> 01:11:52.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:55.110 --> 01:11:55.120 align:start position:0%
well all the rules have
 
01:11:56.630 --> 01:11:56.640 align:start position:0%
uh unless there had been a final
 
01:11:58.709 --> 01:11:58.719 align:start position:0%
objection have uh
 
01:11:58.719 --> 01:11:59.510 align:start position:0%
objection have uh
the

01:11:59.510 --> 01:11:59.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:12:01.189 --> 01:12:01.199 align:start position:0%
value of a law
 
01:12:05.350 --> 01:12:05.360 align:start position:0%
they're presumed legal and valid and
 
01:12:06.870 --> 01:12:06.880 align:start position:0%
you must comply
 
01:12:08.709 --> 01:12:08.719 align:start position:0%
regardless of whether it's a brand new
 
01:12:11.189 --> 01:12:11.199 align:start position:0%
rule or one that has been in place for
 
01:12:13.189 --> 01:12:13.199 align:start position:0%
10 years and now the agency wants to
 
01:12:14.950 --> 01:12:14.960 align:start position:0%
extend it
 
01:12:16.950 --> 01:12:16.960 align:start position:0%
if those rules go out of effect
 
01:12:18.630 --> 01:12:18.640 align:start position:0%
it's the same whether it's a new rule or
 
01:12:19.830 --> 01:12:19.840 align:start position:0%
an old rule
 
01:12:22.630 --> 01:12:22.640 align:start position:0%
you can no longer enforce those rules
 
01:12:25.750 --> 01:12:25.760 align:start position:0%
and we do have mechanisms in 541a
 
01:12:29.510 --> 01:12:29.520 align:start position:0%
to allow agencies to take some variants
 
01:12:32.070 --> 01:12:32.080 align:start position:0%
like adopting an interim rule for six
 
01:12:33.990 --> 01:12:34.000 align:start position:0%
months because an agency's rule is about
 
01:12:36.070 --> 01:12:36.080 align:start position:0%
to expire
 
01:12:37.110 --> 01:12:37.120 align:start position:0%
you can
 
01:12:37.120 --> 01:12:38.149 align:start position:0%
you can
there

01:12:38.149 --> 01:12:38.159 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:12:40.550 --> 01:12:40.560 align:start position:0%
you can start a rule even before a
 
01:12:42.229 --> 01:12:42.239 align:start position:0%
statute goes into effect if you know
 
01:12:44.070 --> 01:12:44.080 align:start position:0%
there's going to be a new law as long as
 
01:12:45.990 --> 01:12:46.000 align:start position:0%
the rule does not go into effect before
 
01:12:48.070 --> 01:12:48.080 align:start position:0%
the law
 
01:12:51.110 --> 01:12:51.120 align:start position:0%
so there are some measures in place
 
01:12:53.189 --> 01:12:53.199 align:start position:0%
representative mcguire
 
01:12:55.750 --> 01:12:55.760 align:start position:0%
yes thank you i hate to drag this out
 
01:12:55.760 --> 01:12:56.790 align:start position:0%
yes thank you i hate to drag this out
but

01:12:56.790 --> 01:12:56.800 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:12:59.350 --> 01:12:59.360 align:start position:0%
the rules are valid for 10 years and
 
01:13:00.950 --> 01:13:00.960 align:start position:0%
then they expire
 
01:13:02.630 --> 01:13:02.640 align:start position:0%
and we have seen
 
01:13:05.270 --> 01:13:05.280 align:start position:0%
so many cases where the agency comes in
 
01:13:07.750 --> 01:13:07.760 align:start position:0%
and says oh god our rules expired two
 
01:13:08.790 --> 01:13:08.800 align:start position:0%
years ago
 
01:13:11.510 --> 01:13:11.520 align:start position:0%
and we haven't done anything on it what
 
01:13:14.070 --> 01:13:14.080 align:start position:0%
i believe the staff memo is intended to
 
01:13:16.630 --> 01:13:16.640 align:start position:0%
do is to say here's your rules are going
 
01:13:16.640 --> 01:13:17.830 align:start position:0%
do is to say here's your rules are going
to

01:13:17.830 --> 01:13:17.840 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:13:19.830 --> 01:13:19.840 align:start position:0%
expire shortly
 
01:13:21.750 --> 01:13:21.760 align:start position:0%
if you need to change them then start
 
01:13:23.590 --> 01:13:23.600 align:start position:0%
rulemaking if you think they're pretty
 
01:13:25.990 --> 01:13:26.000 align:start position:0%
good already then just
 
01:13:27.830 --> 01:13:27.840 align:start position:0%
renew them as is
 
01:13:29.910 --> 01:13:29.920 align:start position:0%
and i think that that's what we need to
 
01:13:31.830 --> 01:13:31.840 align:start position:0%
do is have them think about the fact
 
01:13:34.550 --> 01:13:34.560 align:start position:0%
their rules are expiring because
 
01:13:36.229 --> 01:13:36.239 align:start position:0%
if they don't they're going to end up
 
01:13:37.910 --> 01:13:37.920 align:start position:0%
with expired rules that they can't
 
01:13:37.920 --> 01:13:43.350 align:start position:0%
with expired rules that they can't
enforce

01:13:43.350 --> 01:13:43.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:44.709 --> 01:13:44.719 align:start position:0%
yes and
 
01:13:46.229 --> 01:13:46.239 align:start position:0%
the reason for us running that report
 
01:13:47.750 --> 01:13:47.760 align:start position:0%
was specifically to do that to let some
 
01:13:49.990 --> 01:13:50.000 align:start position:0%
of these agencies know this is happening
 
01:13:51.590 --> 01:13:51.600 align:start position:0%
one of our problems is that our database
 
01:13:54.229 --> 01:13:54.239 align:start position:0%
doesn't allow us to kind of pull this
 
01:13:55.830 --> 01:13:55.840 align:start position:0%
information easily
 
01:13:57.270 --> 01:13:57.280 align:start position:0%
and to keep track of it and that is
 
01:13:58.709 --> 01:13:58.719 align:start position:0%
something that we're moving forward with
 
01:14:00.550 --> 01:14:00.560 align:start position:0%
with it to fix that problem in the
 
01:14:02.709 --> 01:14:02.719 align:start position:0%
future so in the future we'll be able to
 
01:14:05.270 --> 01:14:05.280 align:start position:0%
kind of ping an agency maybe a year out
 
01:14:06.870 --> 01:14:06.880 align:start position:0%
of an expiration and let them know so
 
01:14:08.070 --> 01:14:08.080 align:start position:0%
hopefully that will eventually be
 
01:14:09.510 --> 01:14:09.520 align:start position:0%
resolved but for now we're doing it
 
01:14:09.520 --> 01:14:13.189 align:start position:0%
resolved but for now we're doing it
manually

01:14:13.189 --> 01:14:13.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:13.199 --> 01:14:14.390 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:14:14.390 --> 01:14:14.400 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:14:29.910 --> 01:14:29.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:49.700 --> 01:14:49.710 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:49.710 --> 01:14:52.070 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

01:14:52.070 --> 01:14:52.080 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:14:53.990 --> 01:14:54.000 align:start position:0%
i think i did see a notice come through
 
01:14:55.590 --> 01:14:55.600 align:start position:0%
i'm assuming it's going to be an exact
 
01:14:55.600 --> 01:14:56.390 align:start position:0%
i'm assuming it's going to be an exact
session

01:14:56.390 --> 01:14:56.400 align:start position:0%
session
 
01:14:57.510 --> 01:14:57.520 align:start position:0%
because we've heard all the public
 
01:14:59.750 --> 01:14:59.760 align:start position:0%
hearings right oh well we
 
01:15:01.189 --> 01:15:01.199 align:start position:0%
might have i know we wouldn't make
 
01:22:33.430 --> 01:22:33.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:33.440 --> 01:22:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
you
