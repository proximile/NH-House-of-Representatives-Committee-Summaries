00:13:27.990 --> 00:13:28.000 align:start position:0%
everyone all right so uh for our last
 
00:13:31.150 --> 00:13:31.160 align:start position:0%
day as a committee for
 
00:13:33.990 --> 00:13:34.000 align:start position:0%
the 23 24
 
00:13:38.829 --> 00:13:38.839 align:start position:0%
session um we only have what 33 30 some
 
00:13:40.910 --> 00:13:40.920 align:start position:0%
bills to have to get through here but
 
00:13:42.470 --> 00:13:42.480 align:start position:0%
since we all know what we're going to do
 
00:13:45.509 --> 00:13:45.519 align:start position:0%
here um my biggest interest in each one
 
00:13:47.230 --> 00:13:47.240 align:start position:0%
we get is who's going to be willing to
 
00:13:49.509 --> 00:13:49.519 align:start position:0%
write the committee report and I'm
 
00:13:51.389 --> 00:13:51.399 align:start position:0%
hoping I get volunteers because I hate
 
00:13:56.230 --> 00:13:56.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:59.189 --> 00:13:59.199 align:start position:0%
all so
 
00:14:00.829 --> 00:14:00.839 align:start position:0%
could just be simply that the committee
 
00:14:03.030 --> 00:14:03.040 align:start position:0%
said yeah you say the committee is voted
 
00:14:04.829 --> 00:14:04.839 align:start position:0%
because the language of the bill in its
 
00:14:10.030 --> 00:14:10.040 align:start position:0%
current form is not workable and that uh
 
00:14:11.790 --> 00:14:11.800 align:start position:0%
would and if you want to if you want to
 
00:14:14.550 --> 00:14:14.560 align:start position:0%
say something positive to if you really
 
00:14:16.230 --> 00:14:16.240 align:start position:0%
kind of wanted the bill the pass you can
 
00:14:19.110 --> 00:14:19.120 align:start position:0%
say that uh that you can find an issue
 
00:14:21.030 --> 00:14:21.040 align:start position:0%
where you think we have some agreement
 
00:14:23.910 --> 00:14:23.920 align:start position:0%
on what we could agree on and say if the
 
00:14:26.430 --> 00:14:26.440 align:start position:0%
bill focusing on that issue then then uh
 
00:14:27.629 --> 00:14:27.639 align:start position:0%
if it you know it's could be
 
00:14:29.910 --> 00:14:29.920 align:start position:0%
reintroduced uh it should be narrowed
 
00:14:32.350 --> 00:14:32.360 align:start position:0%
just simply say it should be narrowed
 
00:14:33.790 --> 00:14:33.800 align:start position:0%

00:41:03.510 --> 00:41:03.520 align:start position:0%
be a different bill that's going to be
 
00:41:05.670 --> 00:41:05.680 align:start position:0%
introduced it's going to be a new bill
 
00:41:15.109 --> 00:41:15.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:17.470 --> 00:41:17.480 align:start position:0%
bill no we're we're saying not
 
00:41:19.750 --> 00:41:19.760 align:start position:0%
recommended because we the bill in its
 
00:41:22.470 --> 00:41:22.480 align:start position:0%
current form is not recommended but that
 
00:41:25.470 --> 00:41:25.480 align:start position:0%
we're recommending that if someone were
 
00:41:28.030 --> 00:41:28.040 align:start position:0%
to other words that that language of
 
00:41:30.430 --> 00:41:30.440 align:start position:0%
recommending is in the blurb of saying
 
00:41:33.670 --> 00:41:33.680 align:start position:0%
if somebody were to put this bill
 
00:41:36.710 --> 00:41:36.720 align:start position:0%
in represent you don't like it that way
 
00:41:38.510 --> 00:41:38.520 align:start position:0%
I I I I disagree I think what we're
 
00:41:40.109 --> 00:41:40.119 align:start position:0%
saying here is that it's recommended for
 
00:41:41.790 --> 00:41:41.800 align:start position:0%
further legislation it doesn't have to
 
00:41:43.630 --> 00:41:43.640 align:start position:0%
be the exact wording of the bill right
 
00:41:45.550 --> 00:41:45.560 align:start position:0%
it can be a different bill but what
 
00:41:47.390 --> 00:41:47.400 align:start position:0%
we're recommending is that they're we're
 
00:41:49.470 --> 00:41:49.480 align:start position:0%
we're basically putting our support
 
00:41:52.309 --> 00:41:52.319 align:start position:0%
again behind anyone who was who wants to
 
00:41:53.630 --> 00:41:53.640 align:start position:0%
resubmit this bill but we're
 
00:41:55.750 --> 00:41:55.760 align:start position:0%
recommending it for future legislation
 
00:41:57.349 --> 00:41:57.359 align:start position:0%
and and I think that it says that that
 
00:41:59.069 --> 00:41:59.079 align:start position:0%
we encourage someone to come forward
 
00:42:00.710 --> 00:42:00.720 align:start position:0%
with a bill doesn't require us to do any
 
00:42:03.430 --> 00:42:03.440 align:start position:0%
more rather than not requiring it and if
 
00:42:05.309 --> 00:42:05.319 align:start position:0%
if you if if you're intending to have a
 
00:42:06.870 --> 00:42:06.880 align:start position:0%
motion to say that this is not
 
00:42:09.390 --> 00:42:09.400 align:start position:0%
recommended I will vote no right okay
 
00:42:12.150 --> 00:42:12.160 align:start position:0%
well that's that's fine we can do that
 
00:42:15.710 --> 00:42:15.720 align:start position:0%
but the my intent was always that to is
 
00:42:19.549 --> 00:42:19.559 align:start position:0%
is not to have the next legislature who
 
00:42:21.990 --> 00:42:22.000 align:start position:0%
takes this bill come in and have to go
 
00:42:23.670 --> 00:42:23.680 align:start position:0%
back and look and see what we did or
 
00:42:25.710 --> 00:42:25.720 align:start position:0%
what we thought or where we were at it
 
00:42:28.630 --> 00:42:28.640 align:start position:0%
but that they they have have that as as
 
00:42:30.270 --> 00:42:30.280 align:start position:0%
something that the subcommittee can work
 
00:42:32.549 --> 00:42:32.559 align:start position:0%
with but that at the end of the day that
 
00:42:34.510 --> 00:42:34.520 align:start position:0%
bill as is being introduced will be the
 
00:42:36.349 --> 00:42:36.359 align:start position:0%
new new bill it'll be a new subject what
 
00:42:37.750 --> 00:42:37.760 align:start position:0%
they will do Mr chairman they will look
 
00:42:38.910 --> 00:42:38.920 align:start position:0%
back at what we did here in this
 
00:42:40.670 --> 00:42:40.680 align:start position:0%
legislation and our recommendation that
 
00:42:42.910 --> 00:42:42.920 align:start position:0%
we encourage further legislation right
 
00:42:45.349 --> 00:42:45.359 align:start position:0%
so and I think if we vote no they would
 
00:42:47.190 --> 00:42:47.200 align:start position:0%
look back at this committee saying that
 
00:42:48.390 --> 00:42:48.400 align:start position:0%
well the committee didn't think it was
 
00:42:50.030 --> 00:42:50.040 align:start position:0%
important or think this was a good
 
00:42:51.790 --> 00:42:51.800 align:start position:0%
enough bill so therefore maybe we
 
00:42:54.069 --> 00:42:54.079 align:start position:0%
shouldn't introduce something or maybe
 
00:42:55.670 --> 00:42:55.680 align:start position:0%
people will look at this and saying we
 
00:42:56.829 --> 00:42:56.839 align:start position:0%
shouldn't support this in the future
 
00:42:58.870 --> 00:42:58.880 align:start position:0%
where say if we say yes it is
 
00:43:00.630 --> 00:43:00.640 align:start position:0%
recommended for future legislation we're
 
00:43:02.390 --> 00:43:02.400 align:start position:0%
supporting efforts to move forward and
 
00:43:03.549 --> 00:43:03.559 align:start position:0%
people going to look back that this
 
00:43:06.309 --> 00:43:06.319 align:start position:0%
committee supports this effort and I
 
00:43:08.510 --> 00:43:08.520 align:start position:0%
think that's what the seemed to be that
 
00:43:10.670 --> 00:43:10.680 align:start position:0%
we supported this effort and we support
 
00:43:12.030 --> 00:43:12.040 align:start position:0%
it in the future and we want to see it
 
00:43:13.790 --> 00:43:13.800 align:start position:0%
come back voting no would be contrary to
 
00:43:16.230 --> 00:43:16.240 align:start position:0%
that y I agree me voting saying not
 
00:43:18.270 --> 00:43:18.280 align:start position:0%
recommended would be contrary all right
 
00:43:18.280 --> 00:43:19.510 align:start position:0%
recommended would be contrary all right
representative

00:43:19.510 --> 00:43:19.520 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:43:22.589 --> 00:43:22.599 align:start position:0%
m m Mr chairman can I ask you just a
 
00:43:25.150 --> 00:43:25.160 align:start position:0%
question I thought that we're discussing
 
00:43:27.950 --> 00:43:27.960 align:start position:0%
the bill in its basically exact current
 
00:43:31.670 --> 00:43:31.680 align:start position:0%
form so if we supported this
 
00:43:35.950 --> 00:43:35.960 align:start position:0%
bill in let me just let me just me just
 
00:43:40.150 --> 00:43:40.160 align:start position:0%
finish if that's what I said my
 
00:43:42.549 --> 00:43:42.559 align:start position:0%
understanding is if we supported this
 
00:43:45.069 --> 00:43:45.079 align:start position:0%
bill in its current form like I'm I'm
 
00:43:47.589 --> 00:43:47.599 align:start position:0%
going to speak for my own bill because I
 
00:43:48.750 --> 00:43:48.760 align:start position:0%
would have liked to have seen it pass
 
00:43:50.710 --> 00:43:50.720 align:start position:0%
too and I'm writing a blurb saying it's
 
00:43:52.390 --> 00:43:52.400 align:start position:0%
not recommended for future legislation
 
00:43:53.990 --> 00:43:54.000 align:start position:0%
because I understood through the process
 
00:43:55.109 --> 00:43:55.119 align:start position:0%
and aerm
 
00:43:57.790 --> 00:43:57.800 align:start position:0%
study that it's not like there were
 
00:44:00.309 --> 00:44:00.319 align:start position:0%
enough issues with it and so I wrote the
 
00:44:02.510 --> 00:44:02.520 align:start position:0%
blur not recommended for my own bill
 
00:44:03.910 --> 00:44:03.920 align:start position:0%
that it's not recommended for future
 
00:44:06.430 --> 00:44:06.440 align:start position:0%
legislation however I think there's
 
00:44:09.230 --> 00:44:09.240 align:start position:0%
enough issues with it you know safety
 
00:44:12.790 --> 00:44:12.800 align:start position:0%
and affordability of of uh prescription
 
00:44:14.990 --> 00:44:15.000 align:start position:0%
drugs I think we all think that we ought
 
00:44:16.910 --> 00:44:16.920 align:start position:0%
to study you know we ought to address
 
00:44:18.950 --> 00:44:18.960 align:start position:0%
the issue of affordability and pricing
 
00:44:21.069 --> 00:44:21.079 align:start position:0%
of prescription drugs I think that's
 
00:44:24.349 --> 00:44:24.359 align:start position:0%
very bipartisan everybody agrees that
 
00:44:25.710 --> 00:44:25.720 align:start position:0%
drugs are expensive and we should look
 
00:44:28.230 --> 00:44:28.240 align:start position:0%
at those issues so so we should continue
 
00:44:29.870 --> 00:44:29.880 align:start position:0%
to look at those issues but it wasn't
 
00:44:32.710 --> 00:44:32.720 align:start position:0%
that bill and I think it's we pretty we
 
00:44:34.470 --> 00:44:34.480 align:start position:0%
also pretty much agree in the case of
 
00:44:38.309 --> 00:44:38.319 align:start position:0%
this one um coverage for glucometer
 
00:44:40.270 --> 00:44:40.280 align:start position:0%
monitoring I hear it all the time I use
 
00:44:42.790 --> 00:44:42.800 align:start position:0%
it myself we ought to look at it but if
 
00:44:45.430 --> 00:44:45.440 align:start position:0%
somebody brought back this this bill
 
00:44:48.190 --> 00:44:48.200 align:start position:0%
unamended this language we wouldn't
 
00:44:50.270 --> 00:44:50.280 align:start position:0%
recommend it because we didn't before or
 
00:44:51.990 --> 00:44:52.000 align:start position:0%
we would have passed it except that
 
00:44:55.430 --> 00:44:55.440 align:start position:0%
we're writing in here why what needs to
 
00:44:58.390 --> 00:44:58.400 align:start position:0%
change what yes agreed and that's and
 
00:45:01.069 --> 00:45:01.079 align:start position:0%
that's good we we should Pro I believe I
 
00:45:03.069 --> 00:45:03.079 align:start position:0%
believe we should probably do that but
 
00:45:03.079 --> 00:45:04.069 align:start position:0%
believe we should probably do that but
this

00:45:04.069 --> 00:45:04.079 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:45:06.390 --> 00:45:06.400 align:start position:0%
bill this bill and it is a little bit of
 
00:45:08.150 --> 00:45:08.160 align:start position:0%
semantics but this bill is not
 
00:45:12.030 --> 00:45:12.040 align:start position:0%
recommended and like my own bill 5 513 I
 
00:45:14.349 --> 00:45:14.359 align:start position:0%
think it was I'm not
 
00:45:16.349 --> 00:45:16.359 align:start position:0%
recommending so we're not recommending
 
00:45:18.549 --> 00:45:18.559 align:start position:0%
any of these bills then what's the words
 
00:45:21.270 --> 00:45:21.280 align:start position:0%
future legislation mean okay so what I
 
00:45:23.870 --> 00:45:23.880 align:start position:0%
what I'm saying to you right that we
 
00:45:25.430 --> 00:45:25.440 align:start position:0%
used to
 
00:45:28.710 --> 00:45:28.720 align:start position:0%
have not recom mended recommended or
 
00:45:31.430 --> 00:45:31.440 align:start position:0%
recommended with
 
00:45:34.109 --> 00:45:34.119 align:start position:0%
Amendment they took that motion away
 
00:45:34.119 --> 00:45:36.030 align:start position:0%
Amendment they took that motion away
from

00:45:36.030 --> 00:45:36.040 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:45:39.069 --> 00:45:39.079 align:start position:0%
us okay under the rules that motion was
 
00:45:41.990 --> 00:45:42.000 align:start position:0%
taken away so here's the point the point
 
00:45:45.069 --> 00:45:45.079 align:start position:0%
being is to say is would we really
 
00:45:48.910 --> 00:45:48.920 align:start position:0%
recommend a bill that it it doesn't
 
00:45:50.710 --> 00:45:50.720 align:start position:0%
matter whether you're pre-diabetic or
 
00:45:53.230 --> 00:45:53.240 align:start position:0%
diabetic or not diabetic at all that we
 
00:45:54.790 --> 00:45:54.800 align:start position:0%
are going to do a health insurance
 
00:45:56.510 --> 00:45:56.520 align:start position:0%
mandate then anybody can get one of
 
00:45:59.109 --> 00:45:59.119 align:start position:0%
these glut close monitoring things well
 
00:46:02.309 --> 00:46:02.319 align:start position:0%
no okay so that's why I will let you
 
00:46:04.950 --> 00:46:04.960 align:start position:0%
speak I'll let you speak okay so that's
 
00:46:08.390 --> 00:46:08.400 align:start position:0%
why the the issue is that what I thought
 
00:46:11.870 --> 00:46:11.880 align:start position:0%
I sent out in my email to everybody is
 
00:46:15.589 --> 00:46:15.599 align:start position:0%
all B bills are not recommended but that
 
00:46:17.790 --> 00:46:17.800 align:start position:0%
if you really do want the issue if you
 
00:46:19.990 --> 00:46:20.000 align:start position:0%
really do want that bill that you really
 
00:46:22.790 --> 00:46:22.800 align:start position:0%
like the issue then I wanted you to
 
00:46:27.030 --> 00:46:27.040 align:start position:0%
write the blurb and say that even though
 
00:46:28.309 --> 00:46:28.319 align:start position:0%
the committee is not recommending
 
00:46:31.510 --> 00:46:31.520 align:start position:0%
legislation we think that a bill that
 
00:46:36.309 --> 00:46:36.319 align:start position:0%
says this is does that then that would
 
00:46:38.270 --> 00:46:38.280 align:start position:0%
that that's your recommendation but
 
00:46:40.230 --> 00:46:40.240 align:start position:0%
you're writing that recommendation in
 
00:46:42.910 --> 00:46:42.920 align:start position:0%
the committee report as a recommendation
 
00:46:45.510 --> 00:46:45.520 align:start position:0%
for the future legislature the future
 
00:46:47.710 --> 00:46:47.720 align:start position:0%
committee the for future sponsor so my
 
00:46:48.990 --> 00:46:49.000 align:start position:0%
question is do I have to change what do
 
00:46:51.349 --> 00:46:51.359 align:start position:0%
I change here I'll worry about
 
00:46:55.230 --> 00:46:55.240 align:start position:0%
that okay then are you willing to make
 
00:46:58.390 --> 00:46:58.400 align:start position:0%
the motion not for legislation knowing
 
00:46:59.750 --> 00:46:59.760 align:start position:0%
that your blurb is not going to be
 
00:47:02.549 --> 00:47:02.559 align:start position:0%
changed too much yeah I'll vote for that
 
00:47:07.589 --> 00:47:07.599 align:start position:0%
okay too much okay so anybody else would
 
00:47:09.270 --> 00:47:09.280 align:start position:0%
like to represent
 
00:47:11.790 --> 00:47:11.800 align:start position:0%
a I mean is it possible to say something
 
00:47:14.589 --> 00:47:14.599 align:start position:0%
like not recommended with its current
 
00:47:17.589 --> 00:47:17.599 align:start position:0%
wording but unfortunately we need yes
 
00:47:18.790 --> 00:47:18.800 align:start position:0%
you could write that that's exactly in
 
00:47:21.349 --> 00:47:21.359 align:start position:0%
the blur exactly but not but not in the
 
00:47:22.829 --> 00:47:22.839 align:start position:0%
you can't write cuz they took that
 
00:47:25.230 --> 00:47:25.240 align:start position:0%
recommendation got it it's not
 
00:47:27.549 --> 00:47:27.559 align:start position:0%
recommended in as it's didn't that you
 
00:47:30.109 --> 00:47:30.119 align:start position:0%
know that but that you know that uh the
 
00:47:32.670 --> 00:47:32.680 align:start position:0%
committee absolutely uh has been working
 
00:47:34.990 --> 00:47:35.000 align:start position:0%
and thinking about this issue and if you
 
00:47:36.950 --> 00:47:36.960 align:start position:0%
narrow it down and to what you would
 
00:47:38.910 --> 00:47:38.920 align:start position:0%
wrote in your blurb you know narrowing
 
00:47:42.230 --> 00:47:42.240 align:start position:0%
it down then you know then yeah as long
 
00:47:43.990 --> 00:47:44.000 align:start position:0%
if if you're willing to just make a
 
00:47:46.790 --> 00:47:46.800 align:start position:0%
change to the to the top part uh not
 
00:47:48.829 --> 00:47:48.839 align:start position:0%
recommended then and if you leave the
 
00:47:50.390 --> 00:47:50.400 align:start position:0%
rest of it the way it is then I'm fine
 
00:47:52.069 --> 00:47:52.079 align:start position:0%
with that that's what that's what I plan
 
00:47:54.470 --> 00:47:54.480 align:start position:0%
to do I guess I I missed that when I at
 
00:47:57.309 --> 00:47:57.319 align:start position:0%
the top it was the capital letters it
 
00:47:59.030 --> 00:47:59.040 align:start position:0%
was in
 
00:48:02.470 --> 00:48:02.480 align:start position:0%
caps maybe that's why I didn't read
 
00:48:04.230 --> 00:48:04.240 align:start position:0%
it I don't like it when anybody's
 
00:48:07.190 --> 00:48:07.200 align:start position:0%
yelling at me so I I didn't read the
 
00:48:10.750 --> 00:48:10.760 align:start position:0%
blur the uh report but for clarification
 
00:48:13.230 --> 00:48:13.240 align:start position:0%
even though we support the concept the
 
00:48:16.870 --> 00:48:16.880 align:start position:0%
bill in its current form is what we're
 
00:48:18.990 --> 00:48:19.000 align:start position:0%
saying that we
 
00:48:22.190 --> 00:48:22.200 align:start position:0%
want worked on at a future point so the
 
00:48:24.510 --> 00:48:24.520 align:start position:0%
bill could be improved exactly and
 
00:48:27.150 --> 00:48:27.160 align:start position:0%
that's what your write up will refle
 
00:48:29.589 --> 00:48:29.599 align:start position:0%
even though we support it in concept you
 
00:48:32.630 --> 00:48:32.640 align:start position:0%
don't pass Concepts you pass bills and
 
00:48:34.470 --> 00:48:34.480 align:start position:0%
laws thank

grasson okay represent
 
00:49:04.430 --> 00:49:04.440 align:start position:0%
Gibs thank you Mr chairman so just for
 
00:49:07.549 --> 00:49:07.559 align:start position:0%
clarity this is a purely technical
 
00:49:09.630 --> 00:49:09.640 align:start position:0%
recommendation that we don't recommend
 
00:49:11.190 --> 00:49:11.200 align:start position:0%
this particular bill with this
 
00:49:13.870 --> 00:49:13.880 align:start position:0%
particular wording correct but it's not
 
00:49:17.670 --> 00:49:17.680 align:start position:0%
a statement that this is unimportant or
 
00:49:19.950 --> 00:49:19.960 align:start position:0%
that we don't like the idea only that we
 
00:49:21.390 --> 00:49:21.400 align:start position:0%
don't want to go forward with this
 
00:49:24.549 --> 00:49:24.559 align:start position:0%
particular wording um and the person
 
00:49:26.990 --> 00:49:27.000 align:start position:0%
writing the blurb could include
 
00:49:28.630 --> 00:49:28.640 align:start position:0%
something about the importance of the
 
00:49:32.230 --> 00:49:32.240 align:start position:0%
concept exactly thank you should I read
 
00:49:34.950 --> 00:49:34.960 align:start position:0%
my blur don't know it's all right okay
 
00:49:36.589 --> 00:49:36.599 align:start position:0%
because I don't like why do we even have
 
00:49:38.270 --> 00:49:38.280 align:start position:0%
a session if
 
00:49:41.789 --> 00:49:41.799 align:start position:0%
we're often wonder that because of the
 
00:49:44.630 --> 00:49:44.640 align:start position:0%
blurs that are going to go out going to
 
00:49:48.270 --> 00:49:48.280 align:start position:0%
clarify our motion uh my thinking was
 
00:49:51.069 --> 00:49:51.079 align:start position:0%
that we retain the bill for the purpose
 
00:49:53.510 --> 00:49:53.520 align:start position:0%
so that we can talk about it and we can
 
00:49:55.710 --> 00:49:55.720 align:start position:0%
think about it so that when it does come
 
00:49:57.710 --> 00:49:57.720 align:start position:0%
time to write those committee reports
 
00:49:59.750 --> 00:49:59.760 align:start position:0%
the these committee reports that we can
 
00:50:03.270 --> 00:50:03.280 align:start position:0%
state in them what what the issues were
 
00:50:05.829 --> 00:50:05.839 align:start position:0%
of what was wrong with this this one and
 
00:50:08.910 --> 00:50:08.920 align:start position:0%
what we think should occur in any future
 
00:50:12.190 --> 00:50:12.200 align:start position:0%
legislation if we voted um to recommend
 
00:50:14.870 --> 00:50:14.880 align:start position:0%
couldn't the blurb say the same
 
00:50:17.510 --> 00:50:17.520 align:start position:0%
thing or the report it could it could
 
00:50:20.829 --> 00:50:20.839 align:start position:0%
say it could yes you you well you say is
 
00:50:24.470 --> 00:50:24.480 align:start position:0%
we recommend it but boy it need to be
 
00:50:27.470 --> 00:50:27.480 align:start position:0%
amended okay no I was trying to keep it
 
00:50:30.870 --> 00:50:30.880 align:start position:0%
simple and just say at this point this
 
00:50:33.190 --> 00:50:33.200 align:start position:0%
bill in its current form and here's the
 
00:50:34.990 --> 00:50:35.000 align:start position:0%
reason why we don't recommend it should
 
00:50:37.109 --> 00:50:37.119 align:start position:0%
I read the reason and and you state the
 
00:50:38.630 --> 00:50:38.640 align:start position:0%
reasons like you know it was to should I
 
00:50:42.750 --> 00:50:42.760 align:start position:0%
read them sure why don't you read the
 
00:50:45.430 --> 00:50:45.440 align:start position:0%
blur excuse me this bill requires Health
 
00:50:47.349 --> 00:50:47.359 align:start position:0%
carriers to cover the cost of continuous
 
00:50:49.390 --> 00:50:49.400 align:start position:0%
glucose monitoring equipment for anyone
 
00:50:51.589 --> 00:50:51.599 align:start position:0%
with any type of diabetes or
 
00:50:53.309 --> 00:50:53.319 align:start position:0%
hypoglycemia the bill includes
 
00:50:54.990 --> 00:50:55.000 align:start position:0%
Provisions detailing the requirements
 
00:50:57.190 --> 00:50:57.200 align:start position:0%
for qualifications caps on out of pocket
 
00:50:59.309 --> 00:50:59.319 align:start position:0%
expenses and coverage under Medicaid as
 
00:51:01.390 --> 00:51:01.400 align:start position:0%
it exists the bill is too broad in scope
 
00:51:03.470 --> 00:51:03.480 align:start position:0%
with no way to bound the cost it is
 
00:51:05.190 --> 00:51:05.200 align:start position:0%
recommended that the bill be Rewritten
 
00:51:07.309 --> 00:51:07.319 align:start position:0%
to only include persons diagnosed with
 
00:51:09.950 --> 00:51:09.960 align:start position:0%
type 2 diabetes on therapies other than
 
00:51:12.349 --> 00:51:12.359 align:start position:0%
insulin glucose monitoring is already
 
00:51:14.349 --> 00:51:14.359 align:start position:0%
provided for those on insulin and
 
00:51:17.030 --> 00:51:17.040 align:start position:0%
covered fully under fully insured plans
 
00:51:18.390 --> 00:51:18.400 align:start position:0%
in the New Hampshire large and small
 
00:51:20.950 --> 00:51:20.960 align:start position:0%
group markets requirements for Medicaid
 
00:51:22.430 --> 00:51:22.440 align:start position:0%
recipients should be handled in a
 
00:51:24.789 --> 00:51:24.799 align:start position:0%
separate bill caps should be eliminated
 
00:51:26.990 --> 00:51:27.000 align:start position:0%
data shows that caps often drive up cost
 
00:51:29.430 --> 00:51:29.440 align:start position:0%
of medical devices paid for insurance
 
00:51:31.309 --> 00:51:31.319 align:start position:0%
carriers Based on data received from the
 
00:51:32.990 --> 00:51:33.000 align:start position:0%
insurance department across type 1
 
00:51:35.309 --> 00:51:35.319 align:start position:0%
diabetes there is very little C sharing
 
00:51:37.030 --> 00:51:37.040 align:start position:0%
with respect to continuous glucose
 
00:51:39.270 --> 00:51:39.280 align:start position:0%
monitoring equipment again based on the
 
00:51:41.270 --> 00:51:41.280 align:start position:0%
findings from data received on type 1
 
00:51:43.349 --> 00:51:43.359 align:start position:0%
patients presented by the insurance
 
00:51:44.670 --> 00:51:44.680 align:start position:0%
department and their assumptions
 
00:51:46.109 --> 00:51:46.119 align:start position:0%
regarding the number of type two
 
00:51:47.549 --> 00:51:47.559 align:start position:0%
patients willing to accept such
 
00:51:49.789 --> 00:51:49.799 align:start position:0%
monitoring equipment the expected impact
 
00:51:51.390 --> 00:51:51.400 align:start position:0%
to insurance cost would be fairly low
 
00:51:52.829 --> 00:51:52.839 align:start position:0%
and I have the detailed numbers if
 
00:51:55.510 --> 00:51:55.520 align:start position:0%
anybody cares however these costs would
 
00:51:57.190 --> 00:51:57.200 align:start position:0%
be mitigated by a reduction in the
 
00:51:58.990 --> 00:51:59.000 align:start position:0%
severe often critical outcomes of
 
00:52:00.910 --> 00:52:00.920 align:start position:0%
diabetes on patients who do not
 
00:52:04.150 --> 00:52:04.160 align:start position:0%
correctly monitor their glucose
 
00:52:07.190 --> 00:52:07.200 align:start position:0%
levels I approve that that thank
 
00:52:10.349 --> 00:52:10.359 align:start position:0%
you so now we are going to recommend no
 
00:52:12.109 --> 00:52:12.119 align:start position:0%
we're not recommending for future
 
00:52:15.190 --> 00:52:15.200 align:start position:0%
legislation but she's TI she's in there
 
00:52:18.789 --> 00:52:18.799 align:start position:0%

00:56:57.950 --> 00:56:57.960 align:start position:0%
okay but you can write in support she
 
00:57:00.270 --> 00:57:00.280 align:start position:0%
could write in it that you know that if

the way if they could do something to

address some of the issues that are in
 
00:57:04.079 --> 00:57:05.510 align:start position:0%
address some of the issues that are in

00:57:05.510 --> 00:57:05.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:57:08.069 --> 00:57:08.079 align:start position:0%
bill you know that that why we're not
 
00:57:09.910 --> 00:57:09.920 align:start position:0%
we're not recommending it because it's
 
00:57:12.630 --> 00:57:12.640 align:start position:0%
you know way it's written but if she
 
00:57:15.910 --> 00:57:15.920 align:start position:0%
could say in it that if the bill did
 
00:57:18.870 --> 00:57:18.880 align:start position:0%
this or that you know then then would
 
00:57:21.430 --> 00:57:21.440 align:start position:0%
there would be more sympathy for it
 
00:57:23.510 --> 00:57:23.520 align:start position:0%
represent basically I'd be saying that
 
00:57:25.190 --> 00:57:25.200 align:start position:0%
we're not recommending it because the
 
00:57:27.789 --> 00:57:27.799 align:start position:0%
system in the bill was overly
 
00:57:30.670 --> 00:57:30.680 align:start position:0%
complex and that if another bill with
 
00:57:32.309 --> 00:57:32.319 align:start position:0%
the same purpose were to be brought
 
00:57:35.309 --> 00:57:35.319 align:start position:0%

future legislation but has
 
01:06:40.589 --> 01:06:40.599 align:start position:0%
a has a committee report maybe you want
 
01:06:43.029 --> 01:06:43.039 align:start position:0%
to read your committee report this bill
 
01:06:45.109 --> 01:06:45.119 align:start position:0%
seeks to add Down syndrome to the list
 
01:06:48.109 --> 01:06:48.119 align:start position:0%
of biologically based mental illnesses
 
01:06:52.430 --> 01:06:52.440 align:start position:0%
listed in RSA 4 uh 17e in order to gain
 
01:06:54.750 --> 01:06:54.760 align:start position:0%
access to certain behavioral therapies
 
01:06:57.069 --> 01:06:57.079 align:start position:0%
however down syndrome itself is not a
 
01:06:59.269 --> 01:06:59.279 align:start position:0%
mental disorder and I think that needs
 
01:07:02.870 --> 01:07:02.880 align:start position:0%
to be very clear it is a genetic
 
01:07:04.750 --> 01:07:04.760 align:start position:0%
condition that includes intellectual
 
01:07:07.430 --> 01:07:07.440 align:start position:0%
disability Down syndrome individuals
 
01:07:09.549 --> 01:07:09.559 align:start position:0%
have some form of autis uh excuse me
 
01:07:11.870 --> 01:07:11.880 align:start position:0%
down syndrome individuals can certainly
 
01:07:14.190 --> 01:07:14.200 align:start position:0%
have accompanying mental disorders for
 
01:07:15.870 --> 01:07:15.880 align:start position:0%
example it is estimated that
 
01:07:19.109 --> 01:07:19.119 align:start position:0%
approximately 20% also have some form of
 
01:07:21.750 --> 01:07:21.760 align:start position:0%
autism spectrum disorder based on
 
01:07:23.390 --> 01:07:23.400 align:start position:0%
discussions with medical director of the
 
01:07:25.109 --> 01:07:25.119 align:start position:0%
largest health insurance provider and
 
01:07:26.630 --> 01:07:26.640 align:start position:0%
the fully insured Market in New
 
01:07:29.230 --> 01:07:29.240 align:start position:0%

01:07:31.430 --> 01:07:31.440 align:start position:0%
diagnosed with exhibiting symptoms of
 
01:07:33.990 --> 01:07:34.000 align:start position:0%
autism and who are correctly coded as
 
01:07:36.069 --> 01:07:36.079 align:start position:0%
such by their doctor have full access to
 
01:07:38.390 --> 01:07:38.400 align:start position:0%

01:07:39.829 --> 01:07:39.839 align:start position:0%
organizations including the New
 
01:07:41.470 --> 01:07:41.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire insurance department were
 
01:07:43.390 --> 01:07:43.400 align:start position:0%
asked if there were any records of
 
01:07:45.349 --> 01:07:45.359 align:start position:0%
complaints or individuals being turned
 
01:07:47.870 --> 01:07:47.880 align:start position:0%
down for treatment while one person did
 
01:07:49.870 --> 01:07:49.880 align:start position:0%
come forward they were recovered under a
 
01:07:51.950 --> 01:07:51.960 align:start position:0%
self-insured plan over which the
 
01:07:54.990 --> 01:07:55.000 align:start position:0%
legislature has no control the concern
 
01:07:56.990 --> 01:07:57.000 align:start position:0%
is that the those patients that may need
 
01:08:00.349 --> 01:08:00.359 align:start position:0%
help are not seeking it and while 353 is
 
01:08:02.190 --> 01:08:02.200 align:start position:0%
problematic as written a better written
 
01:08:04.510 --> 01:08:04.520 align:start position:0%
Bill accompanied by actionable data
 
01:08:07.390 --> 01:08:07.400 align:start position:0%

01:09:18.470 --> 01:09:18.480 align:start position:0%

yes Michael Timothy came in yes and we

13 1380 I guess it was yes
 
01:20:27.550 --> 01:20:27.560 align:start position:0%
they came back with a letter that
 
01:20:29.910 --> 01:20:29.920 align:start position:0%
indicated the wrong one got passed
 
01:20:31.390 --> 01:20:31.400 align:start position:0%
correct and I will be putting in the
 
01:20:32.790 --> 01:20:32.800 align:start position:0%
bill in to correct that that's what I
 
01:20:36.709 --> 01:20:36.719 align:start position:0%
wanted to know okay good so for now no
 
01:20:39.790 --> 01:20:39.800 align:start position:0%
it's a nonissue now but it there was
 
01:20:41.229 --> 01:20:41.239 align:start position:0%
there was some tension whether the
 
01:20:42.910 --> 01:20:42.920 align:start position:0%
governor should veto the whole thing
 
01:20:45.550 --> 01:20:45.560 align:start position:0%
which we didn't want them to do so we
 
01:20:48.310 --> 01:20:48.320 align:start position:0%
the the the what actually ironically
 
01:20:52.709 --> 01:20:52.719 align:start position:0%
what we passed pass is actually statute
 
01:20:55.070 --> 01:20:55.080 align:start position:0%
and that we will we will amend it uh I
 
01:20:57.629 --> 01:20:57.639 align:start position:0%
will I'll will amend it for next session
 
01:21:00.070 --> 01:21:00.080 align:start position:0%
okay it's back to the compromise
 
01:21:03.229 --> 01:21:03.239 align:start position:0%
