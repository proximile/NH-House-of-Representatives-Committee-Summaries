the bill first comes to this committee
 
00:28:41.190 --> 00:28:41.200 align:start position:0%
which is called the fish and game
 
00:28:44.230 --> 00:28:44.240 align:start position:0%
committee and we invite people to come
 
00:28:45.909 --> 00:28:45.919 align:start position:0%
and testify
 
00:28:48.710 --> 00:28:48.720 align:start position:0%
either for or against that bill
 
00:28:50.870 --> 00:28:50.880 align:start position:0%
and then we make a decision as to
 
00:28:52.870 --> 00:28:52.880 align:start position:0%
whether we um
 
00:28:55.269 --> 00:28:55.279 align:start position:0%
want to go forward with the bill or
 
00:28:57.430 --> 00:28:57.440 align:start position:0%
rather it should just die right here in
 
00:28:59.990 --> 00:29:00.000 align:start position:0%
the committee if it goes forward
 
00:29:02.149 --> 00:29:02.159 align:start position:0%
then it goes to the
 
00:29:04.789 --> 00:29:04.799 align:start position:0%
everybody that's in the house all 400 of
 
00:29:06.310 --> 00:29:06.320 align:start position:0%
the people who
 
00:29:08.789 --> 00:29:08.799 align:start position:0%
were elected to be in the house
 
00:29:11.029 --> 00:29:11.039 align:start position:0%
we say that it's going to the floor
 
00:29:13.430 --> 00:29:13.440 align:start position:0%
and again it's debated on the floor and
 
00:29:15.750 --> 00:29:15.760 align:start position:0%
they make up their mind as to whether
 
00:29:17.669 --> 00:29:17.679 align:start position:0%
it's a good bill or
 
00:29:19.510 --> 00:29:19.520 align:start position:0%
a bill that should be
 
00:29:21.269 --> 00:29:21.279 align:start position:0%
killed right then and there
 
00:29:22.710 --> 00:29:22.720 align:start position:0%
from there
 
00:29:25.350 --> 00:29:25.360 align:start position:0%
it is passed over to the other body
 
00:29:27.110 --> 00:29:27.120 align:start position:0%
which is called the senate
 
00:29:28.470 --> 00:29:28.480 align:start position:0%
and the senate
 
00:29:31.269 --> 00:29:31.279 align:start position:0%
hears the same bill in their committee
 
00:29:33.590 --> 00:29:33.600 align:start position:0%
that corresponds to a fishing game
 
00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:34.630 align:start position:0%
that corresponds to a fishing game
and

00:29:34.630 --> 00:29:34.640 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:29:36.310 --> 00:29:36.320 align:start position:0%
again decides if it should come to the
 
00:29:38.630 --> 00:29:38.640 align:start position:0%
floor of the senate and if it does come
 
00:29:40.149 --> 00:29:40.159 align:start position:0%
to the floor of the senate then they
 
00:29:44.149 --> 00:29:44.159 align:start position:0%
vote so it's a long process of
 
00:29:47.029 --> 00:29:47.039 align:start position:0%
review which is good because we don't
 
00:29:49.350 --> 00:29:49.360 align:start position:0%
want to just pass laws willy-nilly we
 
00:29:51.430 --> 00:29:51.440 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that they really are
 
00:29:55.430 --> 00:29:55.440 align:start position:0%
the best for our state and so it's a
 
00:29:57.510 --> 00:29:57.520 align:start position:0%
long process it takes a year
 
00:30:00.149 --> 00:30:00.159 align:start position:0%
and if it finally passes all of those
 
00:30:00.159 --> 00:30:01.110 align:start position:0%
and if it finally passes all of those
steps

00:30:01.110 --> 00:30:01.120 align:start position:0%
steps
 
00:30:03.510 --> 00:30:03.520 align:start position:0%
then the governor has the final say-so
 
00:30:05.909 --> 00:30:05.919 align:start position:0%
and he can either sign the bill at which
 
00:30:09.269 --> 00:30:09.279 align:start position:0%
point it becomes law or he can veto it
 
00:30:09.279 --> 00:30:11.510 align:start position:0%
point it becomes law or he can veto it
so

00:30:11.510 --> 00:30:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:11.520 --> 00:30:12.230 align:start position:0%
 
we

00:30:12.230 --> 00:30:12.240 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:30:12.240 --> 00:30:13.430 align:start position:0%
we
we

00:30:13.430 --> 00:30:13.440 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:30:15.830 --> 00:30:15.840 align:start position:0%
our committee is just the first step of
 
00:30:23.669 --> 00:30:23.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:25.510 --> 00:30:25.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:30:27.830 --> 00:30:27.840 align:start position:0%
representative laflam once again i just
 
00:30:31.269 --> 00:30:31.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:33.269 --> 00:30:33.279 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire fish and game
 
00:30:33.279 --> 00:30:34.710 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire fish and game
department

00:30:34.710 --> 00:30:34.720 align:start position:0%
department
 
00:30:36.950 --> 00:30:36.960 align:start position:0%
rules and regulations and there are
 
00:30:39.350 --> 00:30:39.360 align:start position:0%
there are applicable laws as well
 
00:30:41.190 --> 00:30:41.200 align:start position:0%
the executive director
 
00:30:44.070 --> 00:30:44.080 align:start position:0%
um and the fish and game commission
 
00:30:46.389 --> 00:30:46.399 align:start position:0%
um are responsible for making various
 
00:30:48.310 --> 00:30:48.320 align:start position:0%
rules and regulations
 
00:30:51.830 --> 00:30:51.840 align:start position:0%
but i just wanted to impress upon you
 
00:30:54.630 --> 00:30:54.640 align:start position:0%
this is every year this this new book
 
00:30:57.029 --> 00:30:57.039 align:start position:0%
comes out and this is all the new
 
00:30:59.990 --> 00:31:00.000 align:start position:0%
hampshire laws and rules and regulations
 
00:31:02.950 --> 00:31:02.960 align:start position:0%
that involve fish and game so it's just
 
00:31:05.029 --> 00:31:05.039 align:start position:0%
there's a lot more work
 
00:31:08.230 --> 00:31:08.240 align:start position:0%
involved and um we pretty much pretty
 
00:31:10.470 --> 00:31:10.480 align:start position:0%
much change something pretty much every
 
00:31:10.480 --> 00:31:12.389 align:start position:0%
much change something pretty much every
year

00:31:12.389 --> 00:31:12.399 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:31:13.990 --> 00:31:14.000 align:start position:0%
and like i say we
 
00:31:17.350 --> 00:31:17.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:19.669 --> 00:31:19.679 align:start position:0%
is responsible for
 
00:31:22.149 --> 00:31:22.159 align:start position:0%
um fish and game laws
 
00:31:25.029 --> 00:31:25.039 align:start position:0%
and under those laws um
 
00:31:27.190 --> 00:31:27.200 align:start position:0%
and i'm trying to segue over to the
 
00:31:29.830 --> 00:31:29.840 align:start position:0%
executive director
 
00:31:30.950 --> 00:31:30.960 align:start position:0%
we give
 
00:31:32.950 --> 00:31:32.960 align:start position:0%
the executive director
 
00:31:34.789 --> 00:31:34.799 align:start position:0%
the power to make
 
00:31:37.909 --> 00:31:37.919 align:start position:0%
different rules and regulations um
 
00:31:40.549 --> 00:31:40.559 align:start position:0%
that may change we only meet every we
 
00:31:42.470 --> 00:31:42.480 align:start position:0%
have a two-year session
 
00:31:45.509 --> 00:31:45.519 align:start position:0%
so rules and regulations um
 
00:31:47.269 --> 00:31:47.279 align:start position:0%
like for example
 
00:31:48.870 --> 00:31:48.880 align:start position:0%
we don't
 
00:31:51.190 --> 00:31:51.200 align:start position:0%
tell the fish and game department
 
00:31:52.470 --> 00:31:52.480 align:start position:0%
how many
 
00:31:55.669 --> 00:31:55.679 align:start position:0%
of a specific species of fish
 
00:31:58.070 --> 00:31:58.080 align:start position:0%
someone can possess
 
00:31:59.830 --> 00:31:59.840 align:start position:0%
the fish and game department and the
 
00:32:02.070 --> 00:32:02.080 align:start position:0%
executive director takes care of those
 
00:32:04.310 --> 00:32:04.320 align:start position:0%
various rules and regulations
 
00:32:04.320 --> 00:32:05.029 align:start position:0%
various rules and regulations
but

00:32:05.029 --> 00:32:05.039 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:32:07.430 --> 00:32:07.440 align:start position:0%
like i say the volume is pretty pretty
 
00:32:07.440 --> 00:32:08.710 align:start position:0%
like i say the volume is pretty pretty
extensive

00:32:08.710 --> 00:32:08.720 align:start position:0%
extensive
 
00:32:10.310 --> 00:32:10.320 align:start position:0%
so but i
 
00:32:13.190 --> 00:32:13.200 align:start position:0%
swing that that way
 
00:32:15.590 --> 00:32:15.600 align:start position:0%
thank you guys so again just just to
 
00:32:18.070 --> 00:32:18.080 align:start position:0%
kind of reiterate that the idea behind
 
00:32:19.669 --> 00:32:19.679 align:start position:0%
is you drove here you saw the lines on
 
00:32:22.149 --> 00:32:22.159 align:start position:0%
the road so the legislature's job is to
 
00:32:23.990 --> 00:32:24.000 align:start position:0%
paint the lines on either side of the
 
00:32:26.950 --> 00:32:26.960 align:start position:0%
road it's the executives rules over here
 
00:32:29.110 --> 00:32:29.120 align:start position:0%
to stay between those lines and set the
 
00:32:31.669 --> 00:32:31.679 align:start position:0%
rules so we say that they have the right
 
00:32:32.870 --> 00:32:32.880 align:start position:0%
to manage
 
00:32:35.110 --> 00:32:35.120 align:start position:0%
to use the representatives example
 
00:32:36.710 --> 00:32:36.720 align:start position:0%
fish species and how many you can
 
00:32:38.549 --> 00:32:38.559 align:start position:0%
possess we don't tell them how much we
 
00:32:40.149 --> 00:32:40.159 align:start position:0%
just tell them you guys need to regulate
 
00:32:42.070 --> 00:32:42.080 align:start position:0%
it and then they in speaking with the
 
00:32:44.630 --> 00:32:44.640 align:start position:0%
biologists um decide
 
00:32:47.029 --> 00:32:47.039 align:start position:0%
what that looks like um and so i'll turn
 
00:32:49.110 --> 00:32:49.120 align:start position:0%
over to scott mason who's the executive
 
00:32:50.870 --> 00:32:50.880 align:start position:0%
director of the fish and game who again
 
00:32:52.070 --> 00:32:52.080 align:start position:0%
is the
 
00:32:53.430 --> 00:32:53.440 align:start position:0%
person chiefly responsible for the
 
00:32:55.350 --> 00:32:55.360 align:start position:0%
regulatory aspect versus the legal
 
00:32:55.360 --> 00:32:57.509 align:start position:0%
regulatory aspect versus the legal
aspect

00:32:57.509 --> 00:32:57.519 align:start position:0%
aspect
 
00:32:57.519 --> 00:32:58.950 align:start position:0%
aspect
so

00:32:58.950 --> 00:32:58.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:33:01.190 --> 00:33:01.200 align:start position:0%
we have basically two bodies of
 
00:33:01.200 --> 00:33:04.389 align:start position:0%
we have basically two bodies of
governing

00:33:04.389 --> 00:33:04.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:07.590 --> 00:33:07.600 align:start position:0%
rules one would be the laws which is
 
00:33:09.509 --> 00:33:09.519 align:start position:0%
what the legislature passes we call them
 
00:33:12.070 --> 00:33:12.080 align:start position:0%
rsas in new hampshire
 
00:33:13.430 --> 00:33:13.440 align:start position:0%
and then the second
 
00:33:15.909 --> 00:33:15.919 align:start position:0%
are the rules and
 
00:33:19.029 --> 00:33:19.039 align:start position:0%
in order for me to write a rule
 
00:33:20.870 --> 00:33:20.880 align:start position:0%
or for well
 
00:33:22.310 --> 00:33:22.320 align:start position:0%
almost all the rules come come out of
 
00:33:24.470 --> 00:33:24.480 align:start position:0%
the direct executive director's office
 
00:33:26.230 --> 00:33:26.240 align:start position:0%
for me to write a rule
 
00:33:27.830 --> 00:33:27.840 align:start position:0%
i need to have the authority from the
 
00:33:30.070 --> 00:33:30.080 align:start position:0%
legislature to write a rule on that
 
00:33:32.950 --> 00:33:32.960 align:start position:0%
particular subject matter
 
00:33:34.789 --> 00:33:34.799 align:start position:0%
and then we go through a process a
 
00:33:37.350 --> 00:33:37.360 align:start position:0%
hearing process so that we can get input
 
00:33:40.310 --> 00:33:40.320 align:start position:0%
from different stakeholders out there so
 
00:33:42.470 --> 00:33:42.480 align:start position:0%
for example this year
 
00:33:42.480 --> 00:33:43.430 align:start position:0%
for example this year
um

00:33:43.430 --> 00:33:43.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:46.149 --> 00:33:46.159 align:start position:0%
one of our commercial
 
00:33:46.159 --> 00:33:47.190 align:start position:0%
one of our commercial
um

00:33:47.190 --> 00:33:47.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:49.430 --> 00:33:49.440 align:start position:0%
fishermen's it's it's a it's a co-op
 
00:33:51.509 --> 00:33:51.519 align:start position:0%
down on our seacoast
 
00:33:55.029 --> 00:33:55.039 align:start position:0%
wanted to institute tuna tournaments
 
00:33:57.509 --> 00:33:57.519 align:start position:0%
and under new hampshire law we have a
 
00:33:57.519 --> 00:33:58.710 align:start position:0%
and under new hampshire law we have a
very

00:33:58.710 --> 00:33:58.720 align:start position:0%
very
 
00:34:01.350 --> 00:34:01.360 align:start position:0%
expensive permit for an artist for a
 
00:34:03.269 --> 00:34:03.279 align:start position:0%
person from a different state to land a
 
00:34:04.830 --> 00:34:04.840 align:start position:0%
tuna in new
 
00:34:07.350 --> 00:34:07.360 align:start position:0%
hampshire so they've asked for a reduced
 
00:34:09.349 --> 00:34:09.359 align:start position:0%
rate if that person is involved in their
 
00:34:11.349 --> 00:34:11.359 align:start position:0%
tuna tournament
 
00:34:14.069 --> 00:34:14.079 align:start position:0%
it doesn't impact the resource so for us
 
00:34:16.470 --> 00:34:16.480 align:start position:0%
it doesn't it's not a problem but now
 
00:34:18.790 --> 00:34:18.800 align:start position:0%
we've got to go through the process
 
00:34:20.790 --> 00:34:20.800 align:start position:0%
this particular process is probably
 
00:34:22.629 --> 00:34:22.639 align:start position:0%
going to come back to the legislature
 
00:34:25.589 --> 00:34:25.599 align:start position:0%
first to authorize a tuna tournament
 
00:34:27.510 --> 00:34:27.520 align:start position:0%
license or request for a tuna tournament
 
00:34:29.270 --> 00:34:29.280 align:start position:0%
license and then
 
00:34:32.310 --> 00:34:32.320 align:start position:0%
we'll go um to the
 
00:34:33.589 --> 00:34:33.599 align:start position:0%
then we'll go through the rule-making
 
00:34:33.599 --> 00:34:34.389 align:start position:0%
then we'll go through the rule-making
process

00:34:34.389 --> 00:34:34.399 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:34:36.389 --> 00:34:36.399 align:start position:0%
at gelcar which is a com a different
 
00:34:38.069 --> 00:34:38.079 align:start position:0%
committee at legislature to approve the
 
00:34:38.079 --> 00:34:39.030 align:start position:0%
committee at legislature to approve the
process

00:34:39.030 --> 00:34:39.040 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:34:41.030 --> 00:34:41.040 align:start position:0%
so the idea comes up
 
00:34:44.389 --> 00:34:44.399 align:start position:0%
we'll um we'll hold hearings on it
 
00:34:46.950 --> 00:34:46.960 align:start position:0%
um and then we'll write we'll write the
 
00:34:48.550 --> 00:34:48.560 align:start position:0%
rules based off of what we're hearing
 
00:34:50.149 --> 00:34:50.159 align:start position:0%
you know feedback from that
 
00:34:51.750 --> 00:34:51.760 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry we'll start with a written
 
00:34:54.069 --> 00:34:54.079 align:start position:0%
suggested rule and then after the after
 
00:34:56.629 --> 00:34:56.639 align:start position:0%
the hearings we will tweak that rule
 
00:34:58.390 --> 00:34:58.400 align:start position:0%
before we go through the final process
 
00:35:07.510 --> 00:35:07.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:09.270 --> 00:35:09.280 align:start position:0%
and as you can imagine
 
00:35:10.950 --> 00:35:10.960 align:start position:0%
our role in the law enforcement division
 
00:35:12.550 --> 00:35:12.560 align:start position:0%
is to enforce the laws and the
 
00:35:14.790 --> 00:35:14.800 align:start position:0%
administrative rules that are created
 
00:35:17.030 --> 00:35:17.040 align:start position:0%
in the united states new hampshire and
 
00:35:19.030 --> 00:35:19.040 align:start position:0%
the united states the first three miles
 
00:35:21.349 --> 00:35:21.359 align:start position:0%
out in the ocean are state waters so the
 
00:35:24.230 --> 00:35:24.240 align:start position:0%
state laws in the rules would apply when
 
00:35:26.630 --> 00:35:26.640 align:start position:0%
you go beyond three miles it's federal
 
00:35:26.640 --> 00:35:27.750 align:start position:0%
you go beyond three miles it's federal
waters

00:35:27.750 --> 00:35:27.760 align:start position:0%
waters
 
00:35:29.670 --> 00:35:29.680 align:start position:0%
those laws and rules are created by the
 
00:35:31.349 --> 00:35:31.359 align:start position:0%
national marine fisheries service
 
00:35:33.190 --> 00:35:33.200 align:start position:0%
however they don't really have much of
 
00:35:35.109 --> 00:35:35.119 align:start position:0%
an enforcement arm so they deputize us
 
00:35:37.510 --> 00:35:37.520 align:start position:0%
and we also enforce those laws
 
00:35:40.790 --> 00:35:40.800 align:start position:0%
so we're authorized to do both
 
00:35:42.390 --> 00:35:42.400 align:start position:0%
it's probably a little different than
 
00:35:45.430 --> 00:35:45.440 align:start position:0%
than what you have because each country
 
00:35:47.510 --> 00:35:47.520 align:start position:0%
probably has their own waters i imagine
 
00:35:49.270 --> 00:35:49.280 align:start position:0%
so it's a little bit different but the
 
00:35:51.349 --> 00:35:51.359 align:start position:0%
national marine fisheries service will
 
00:35:54.069 --> 00:35:54.079 align:start position:0%
will create the laws for all the federal
 
00:35:56.470 --> 00:35:56.480 align:start position:0%
waters in the united states and then
 
00:35:58.310 --> 00:35:58.320 align:start position:0%
it's our job to help them enforce that
 
00:36:02.390 --> 00:36:02.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:05.030 --> 00:36:05.040 align:start position:0%
thank you and major you have
 
00:36:06.630 --> 00:36:06.640 align:start position:0%
so do you have in your department you
 
00:36:08.950 --> 00:36:08.960 align:start position:0%
have coastal waters enforcement officers
 
00:36:10.630 --> 00:36:10.640 align:start position:0%
as well as inland enforcement officers
 
00:36:13.190 --> 00:36:13.200 align:start position:0%
for lakes as compared to the ocean
 
00:36:15.349 --> 00:36:15.359 align:start position:0%
so good question we have a total of 44
 
00:36:17.589 --> 00:36:17.599 align:start position:0%
officers we have four assigned to our
 
00:36:18.950 --> 00:36:18.960 align:start position:0%
seacoast our seacoast new hampshire is
 
00:36:21.670 --> 00:36:21.680 align:start position:0%
very small it's 18 miles long
 
00:36:24.310 --> 00:36:24.320 align:start position:0%
so we have four officers but because
 
00:36:25.430 --> 00:36:25.440 align:start position:0%
especially during seasons when the
 
00:36:27.750 --> 00:36:27.760 align:start position:0%
commercial fishing is very busy we will
 
00:36:29.510 --> 00:36:29.520 align:start position:0%
also bring officers from all over the
 
00:36:30.950 --> 00:36:30.960 align:start position:0%
state they're all required to know the
 
00:36:32.870 --> 00:36:32.880 align:start position:0%
laws and to be familiar with the coastal
 
00:36:34.710 --> 00:36:34.720 align:start position:0%
laws so we'll ship them down there for a
 
00:36:37.030 --> 00:36:37.040 align:start position:0%
day or multiple days to help those four
 
00:36:38.790 --> 00:36:38.800 align:start position:0%
officers patrol
 
00:36:41.190 --> 00:36:41.200 align:start position:0%
we have a lot of lobstering going on as
 
00:36:43.589 --> 00:36:43.599 align:start position:0%
well as commercial fishing so
 
00:36:45.030 --> 00:36:45.040 align:start position:0%
sometimes we need more offices down
 
00:36:46.470 --> 00:36:46.480 align:start position:0%
there than what what's assigned to that
 
00:36:46.480 --> 00:36:48.870 align:start position:0%
there than what what's assigned to that
area

00:36:48.870 --> 00:36:48.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:50.630 --> 00:36:50.640 align:start position:0%
thank you major
 
00:36:54.710 --> 00:36:54.720 align:start position:0%
so i guess at this point we'll um
 
00:36:57.349 --> 00:36:57.359 align:start position:0%
open up for questions and discussion
 
00:36:57.359 --> 00:36:58.390 align:start position:0%
open up for questions and discussion
so

00:36:58.390 --> 00:36:58.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:37:00.710 --> 00:37:00.720 align:start position:0%
again i tried to give an outline of the
 
00:37:04.390 --> 00:37:04.400 align:start position:0%
regulatory bodies the legal law bodies
 
00:37:06.230 --> 00:37:06.240 align:start position:0%
and how they work together
 
00:37:07.910 --> 00:37:07.920 align:start position:0%
probably most of your questions may be
 
00:37:09.829 --> 00:37:09.839 align:start position:0%
directed towards the major over there
 
00:37:11.990 --> 00:37:12.000 align:start position:0%
about uh enforcement
 
00:37:14.069 --> 00:37:14.079 align:start position:0%
process of what goes on
 
00:37:15.589 --> 00:37:15.599 align:start position:0%
um so
 
00:37:17.510 --> 00:37:17.520 align:start position:0%
let's have a conversation
 
00:37:18.630 --> 00:37:18.640 align:start position:0%
i got
 
00:37:18.640 --> 00:37:21.589 align:start position:0%
i got
me

00:37:21.589 --> 00:37:21.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:22.950 --> 00:37:22.960 align:start position:0%
thank you nali
 
00:37:26.390 --> 00:37:26.400 align:start position:0%
um first of all
 
00:37:28.550 --> 00:37:28.560 align:start position:0%
ladies and gentlemen thank you very much
 
00:37:30.470 --> 00:37:30.480 align:start position:0%
for your timing
 
00:37:33.349 --> 00:37:33.359 align:start position:0%
uh it is really amazing to have find
 
00:37:35.829 --> 00:37:35.839 align:start position:0%
some time in your agendas to give us
 
00:37:38.230 --> 00:37:38.240 align:start position:0%
this chance to to make some questions
 
00:37:39.829 --> 00:37:39.839 align:start position:0%
and so to
 
00:37:42.069 --> 00:37:42.079 align:start position:0%
to try to make some conversation
 
00:37:44.950 --> 00:37:44.960 align:start position:0%
um i just want to know that in cape
 
00:37:47.030 --> 00:37:47.040 align:start position:0%
verde we have a fisher agreement with
 
00:37:48.710 --> 00:37:48.720 align:start position:0%
europe for example
 
00:37:52.069 --> 00:37:52.079 align:start position:0%
that we we are facing for the last 15
 
00:37:52.079 --> 00:37:53.109 align:start position:0%
that we we are facing for the last 15
years

00:37:53.109 --> 00:37:53.119 align:start position:0%
years
 
00:37:53.119 --> 00:37:54.230 align:start position:0%
years
and

00:37:54.230 --> 00:37:54.240 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:37:57.510 --> 00:37:57.520 align:start position:0%
to have an idea it's they give us uh one
 
00:37:59.829 --> 00:37:59.839 align:start position:0%
million dollars for a year
 
00:38:02.390 --> 00:38:02.400 align:start position:0%
to have license for 35
 
00:38:06.230 --> 00:38:06.240 align:start position:0%
giant uh fishing vessels so it's nothing
 
00:38:08.630 --> 00:38:08.640 align:start position:0%
so we have been discussing for example
 
00:38:11.109 --> 00:38:11.119 align:start position:0%
the cape verde for the third consecutive
 
00:38:11.119 --> 00:38:12.150 align:start position:0%
the cape verde for the third consecutive
year

00:38:12.150 --> 00:38:12.160 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:38:14.550 --> 00:38:14.560 align:start position:0%
we have the world record for black
 
00:38:17.750 --> 00:38:17.760 align:start position:0%
swordfish it animals between ten to
 
00:38:19.750 --> 00:38:19.760 align:start position:0%
twelve hundred pounds
 
00:38:23.030 --> 00:38:23.040 align:start position:0%
so uh it and we have the record for the
 
00:38:26.069 --> 00:38:26.079 align:start position:0%
last three years so imagine if cambered
 
00:38:29.910 --> 00:38:29.920 align:start position:0%
can just con direct uh some
 
00:38:29.920 --> 00:38:30.870 align:start position:0%
can just con direct uh some
some

00:38:30.870 --> 00:38:30.880 align:start position:0%
some
 
00:38:34.150 --> 00:38:34.160 align:start position:0%
motivation i said to develop this kind
 
00:38:36.470 --> 00:38:36.480 align:start position:0%
of big game fishing we have 12 vessels
 
00:38:38.870 --> 00:38:38.880 align:start position:0%
of began fishing just in cape verde if
 
00:38:41.109 --> 00:38:41.119 align:start position:0%
you want to make an appointment it take
 
00:38:43.190 --> 00:38:43.200 align:start position:0%
you six months because they are really
 
00:38:45.589 --> 00:38:45.599 align:start position:0%
completely full of course
 
00:38:49.109 --> 00:38:49.119 align:start position:0%
so in my view if the governments promote
 
00:38:51.910 --> 00:38:51.920 align:start position:0%
this kind of fishery that it's more like
 
00:38:55.670 --> 00:38:55.680 align:start position:0%
sustainable because it's catch release
 
00:38:59.030 --> 00:38:59.040 align:start position:0%
then i quite believe we will get more
 
00:39:02.069 --> 00:39:02.079 align:start position:0%
money from this sustainable activity
 
00:39:04.390 --> 00:39:04.400 align:start position:0%
than to make fisher agreements that is
 
00:39:07.349 --> 00:39:07.359 align:start position:0%
just depleting our waters in change of
 
00:39:11.910 --> 00:39:11.920 align:start position:0%
coins okay so for you i re it really
 
00:39:15.109 --> 00:39:15.119 align:start position:0%
helpful if i can get for your site some
 
00:39:15.119 --> 00:39:16.150 align:start position:0%
helpful if i can get for your site some
numbers

00:39:16.150 --> 00:39:16.160 align:start position:0%
numbers
 
00:39:17.190 --> 00:39:17.200 align:start position:0%
here in
 
00:39:20.950 --> 00:39:20.960 align:start position:0%
new hampshire how much money you get it
 
00:39:23.510 --> 00:39:23.520 align:start position:0%
with the fishing games
 
00:39:25.829 --> 00:39:25.839 align:start position:0%
because we have here a representative of
 
00:39:27.910 --> 00:39:27.920 align:start position:0%
the government of cape verde and me and
 
00:39:30.550 --> 00:39:30.560 align:start position:0%
her we can bring these numbers to cape
 
00:39:33.109 --> 00:39:33.119 align:start position:0%
verde's desk to show that it's a huge
 
00:39:35.910 --> 00:39:35.920 align:start position:0%
possibility to have more profitable and
 
00:39:38.470 --> 00:39:38.480 align:start position:0%
sustainable activity than to keep going
 
00:39:40.230 --> 00:39:40.240 align:start position:0%
with the fisher agreements for example
 
00:39:46.550 --> 00:39:46.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:48.870 --> 00:39:48.880 align:start position:0%
when you ask about numbers um how much
 
00:39:50.310 --> 00:39:50.320 align:start position:0%
money the federal government gives us
 
00:39:52.950 --> 00:39:52.960 align:start position:0%
for enforcement or how much uh is the in
 
00:39:54.790 --> 00:39:54.800 align:start position:0%
the economy for fishing yes the
 
00:39:58.710 --> 00:39:58.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:58.720 --> 00:40:00.390 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:40:00.390 --> 00:40:00.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:01.829 --> 00:40:01.839 align:start position:0%
i don't have the numbers off the top of
 
00:40:03.430 --> 00:40:03.440 align:start position:0%
my head but i'd be happy to share what
 
00:40:04.870 --> 00:40:04.880 align:start position:0%
we do have
 
00:40:04.880 --> 00:40:05.910 align:start position:0%
we do have
um

00:40:05.910 --> 00:40:05.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:07.750 --> 00:40:07.760 align:start position:0%
i think
 
00:40:10.390 --> 00:40:10.400 align:start position:0%
let me back up just a one step
 
00:40:10.400 --> 00:40:11.990 align:start position:0%
let me back up just a one step
um

00:40:11.990 --> 00:40:12.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:14.630 --> 00:40:14.640 align:start position:0%
all of our inland water fishing is sport
 
00:40:14.640 --> 00:40:16.230 align:start position:0%
all of our inland water fishing is sport
fishing

00:40:16.230 --> 00:40:16.240 align:start position:0%
fishing
 
00:40:18.069 --> 00:40:18.079 align:start position:0%
we have no commercial fishing on inland
 
00:40:20.630 --> 00:40:20.640 align:start position:0%
waters in new hampshire
 
00:40:21.990 --> 00:40:22.000 align:start position:0%
we do have
 
00:40:24.710 --> 00:40:24.720 align:start position:0%
commercial fishing on our seacoast
 
00:40:29.190 --> 00:40:29.200 align:start position:0%
uh the number one species dollar wise is
 
00:40:31.190 --> 00:40:31.200 align:start position:0%
lobster fishing
 
00:40:33.190 --> 00:40:33.200 align:start position:0%
um we have
 
00:40:35.510 --> 00:40:35.520 align:start position:0%
over time we we we used to have a lot
 
00:40:38.870 --> 00:40:38.880 align:start position:0%
more um um
 
00:40:38.880 --> 00:40:40.069 align:start position:0%
more um um
uh

00:40:40.069 --> 00:40:40.079 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:40:42.150 --> 00:40:42.160 align:start position:0%
commercial fin fishermen that we don't
 
00:40:44.150 --> 00:40:44.160 align:start position:0%
have as many as what historically we
 
00:40:46.470 --> 00:40:46.480 align:start position:0%
used to have so those numbers have have
 
00:40:50.150 --> 00:40:50.160 align:start position:0%
dwindled um that not so much from uh
 
00:40:51.670 --> 00:40:51.680 align:start position:0%
well two things number one is from the
 
00:40:53.510 --> 00:40:53.520 align:start position:0%
changes in regulations that
 
00:40:55.750 --> 00:40:55.760 align:start position:0%
that have come through for trying to
 
00:40:57.829 --> 00:40:57.839 align:start position:0%
improve sustainability of the resource
 
00:41:00.470 --> 00:41:00.480 align:start position:0%
but also just the economics uh impact of
 
00:41:02.470 --> 00:41:02.480 align:start position:0%
of commercial fishing
 
00:41:02.480 --> 00:41:04.790 align:start position:0%
of commercial fishing
um

00:41:04.790 --> 00:41:04.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:41:07.190 --> 00:41:07.200 align:start position:0%
the sport fishing the the
 
00:41:10.550 --> 00:41:10.560 align:start position:0%
inland fisheries i believe that's over
 
00:41:10.560 --> 00:41:11.510 align:start position:0%
inland fisheries i believe that's over
uh

00:41:11.510 --> 00:41:11.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:41:13.589 --> 00:41:13.599 align:start position:0%
180 million a year
 
00:41:16.470 --> 00:41:16.480 align:start position:0%
is a total um economic impact of new
 
00:41:18.829 --> 00:41:18.839 align:start position:0%
hampshire's economy
 
00:41:18.839 --> 00:41:20.390 align:start position:0%
hampshire's economy
um

00:41:20.390 --> 00:41:20.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:41:22.309 --> 00:41:22.319 align:start position:0%
on an annual basis we sell about six
 
00:41:24.870 --> 00:41:24.880 align:start position:0%
million dollars in sport licenses but
 
00:41:26.470 --> 00:41:26.480 align:start position:0%
that would include people coming to
 
00:41:27.990 --> 00:41:28.000 align:start position:0%
state um
 
00:41:30.790 --> 00:41:30.800 align:start position:0%
you know hotels restaurants buying
 
00:41:30.800 --> 00:41:31.990 align:start position:0%
you know hotels restaurants buying
equipment

00:41:31.990 --> 00:41:32.000 align:start position:0%
equipment
 
00:41:35.030 --> 00:41:35.040 align:start position:0%
paying for guides um in case what you're
 
00:41:36.550 --> 00:41:36.560 align:start position:0%
talking about you're hiring the boat
 
00:41:39.510 --> 00:41:39.520 align:start position:0%
that kind of stuff i don't have a number
 
00:41:41.750 --> 00:41:41.760 align:start position:0%
for a specific number for our sport
 
00:41:43.349 --> 00:41:43.359 align:start position:0%
marine fishing
 
00:41:43.359 --> 00:41:44.309 align:start position:0%
marine fishing
um

00:41:44.309 --> 00:41:44.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:41:46.309 --> 00:41:46.319 align:start position:0%
but going back to that tuna tournament
 
00:41:48.790 --> 00:41:48.800 align:start position:0%
uh that i was talking about i do know
 
00:41:50.390 --> 00:41:50.400 align:start position:0%
talking with them they have 70 boats
 
00:41:52.950 --> 00:41:52.960 align:start position:0%
lined up to compete in that this summer
 
00:41:52.960 --> 00:41:53.750 align:start position:0%
lined up to compete in that this summer
yeah

00:41:53.750 --> 00:41:53.760 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:41:56.550 --> 00:41:56.560 align:start position:0%
so it is a big and that that's kind of i
 
00:41:58.630 --> 00:41:58.640 align:start position:0%
think would be our equivalent to what
 
00:42:01.829 --> 00:42:01.839 align:start position:0%
you're talking about would be um sport
 
00:42:03.670 --> 00:42:03.680 align:start position:0%
fishing for tuna here would be you're
 
00:42:06.230 --> 00:42:06.240 align:start position:0%
trying to develop a sport fishing for uh
 
00:42:08.550 --> 00:42:08.560 align:start position:0%
what i apologize was it marlin black
 
00:42:08.560 --> 00:42:09.589 align:start position:0%
what i apologize was it marlin black
marlin

00:42:09.589 --> 00:42:09.599 align:start position:0%
marlin
 
00:42:09.599 --> 00:42:11.910 align:start position:0%
marlin
yeah

00:42:11.910 --> 00:42:11.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:14.710 --> 00:42:14.720 align:start position:0%
okay so i just looked real quick um
 
00:42:17.430 --> 00:42:17.440 align:start position:0%
on the commercial side of things um new
 
00:42:19.510 --> 00:42:19.520 align:start position:0%
hampshire's economy they
 
00:42:21.349 --> 00:42:21.359 align:start position:0%
are the the commercial species the
 
00:42:24.069 --> 00:42:24.079 align:start position:0%
economic values is about 17 million and
 
00:42:25.510 --> 00:42:25.520 align:start position:0%
70 percent of that is made up of
 
00:42:27.670 --> 00:42:27.680 align:start position:0%
lobsters but from the sport fish side i
 
00:42:33.750 --> 00:42:33.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:35.349 --> 00:42:35.359 align:start position:0%
thank you i think you had a question as
 
00:42:35.359 --> 00:42:36.230 align:start position:0%
thank you i think you had a question as
well

00:42:36.230 --> 00:42:36.240 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:42:38.230 --> 00:42:38.240 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you i i'm
 
00:42:40.150 --> 00:42:40.160 align:start position:0%
just not the
 
00:42:43.430 --> 00:42:43.440 align:start position:0%
question so like a chair of a question
 
00:42:46.390 --> 00:42:46.400 align:start position:0%
so please right now
 
00:42:51.990 --> 00:42:52.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:56.390 --> 00:42:56.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:58.470 --> 00:42:58.480 align:start position:0%
so my question is for representative
 
00:42:58.480 --> 00:42:59.670 align:start position:0%
so my question is for representative
harvey

00:42:59.670 --> 00:42:59.680 align:start position:0%
harvey
 
00:42:59.680 --> 00:43:02.490 align:start position:0%
harvey
consultation

00:43:02.490 --> 00:43:02.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:02.500 --> 00:43:05.750 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

00:43:05.750 --> 00:43:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:07.670 --> 00:43:07.680 align:start position:0%
so each time you have a hearing with the
 
00:43:11.030 --> 00:43:11.040 align:start position:0%
public to discuss the bills to to to be
 
00:43:20.550 --> 00:43:20.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:23.430 --> 00:43:23.440 align:start position:0%
is it only does it only take place here
 
00:43:25.829 --> 00:43:25.839 align:start position:0%
or do you go to different towns and
 
00:43:28.309 --> 00:43:28.319 align:start position:0%
cities throughout the state to hear what
 
00:43:38.069 --> 00:43:38.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:40.309 --> 00:43:40.319 align:start position:0%
and how do you help the executive
 
00:43:42.950 --> 00:43:42.960 align:start position:0%
director and the police to fight against
 
00:43:47.349 --> 00:43:47.359 align:start position:0%
illegal fishing in your area
 
00:43:47.359 --> 00:43:48.950 align:start position:0%
illegal fishing in your area
messy

00:43:48.950 --> 00:43:48.960 align:start position:0%
messy
 
00:43:52.630 --> 00:43:52.640 align:start position:0%
so yes the uh hearings are all held here
 
00:43:55.190 --> 00:43:55.200 align:start position:0%
in fact this is the exact room that
 
00:43:58.309 --> 00:43:58.319 align:start position:0%
they're held in we don't go around the
 
00:43:58.319 --> 00:43:59.990 align:start position:0%
they're held in we don't go around the
state

00:43:59.990 --> 00:44:00.000 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:44:03.270 --> 00:44:03.280 align:start position:0%
to hear people's opinions
 
00:44:05.190 --> 00:44:05.200 align:start position:0%
they either come to us
 
00:44:06.390 --> 00:44:06.400 align:start position:0%
in person
 
00:44:08.950 --> 00:44:08.960 align:start position:0%
they can email us testimony written
 
00:44:11.349 --> 00:44:11.359 align:start position:0%
testimony if they can't get here and so
 
00:44:14.950 --> 00:44:14.960 align:start position:0%
forth but this is where it's held um i
 
00:44:16.710 --> 00:44:16.720 align:start position:0%
will say during covid
 
00:44:19.510 --> 00:44:19.520 align:start position:0%
we did have zoom participation but uh
 
00:44:22.550 --> 00:44:22.560 align:start position:0%
now that covet is on the decline that's
 
00:44:24.069 --> 00:44:24.079 align:start position:0%
that's not an option they're all in
 
00:44:24.079 --> 00:44:25.030 align:start position:0%
that's not an option they're all in
person

00:44:25.030 --> 00:44:25.040 align:start position:0%
person
 
00:44:25.040 --> 00:44:26.309 align:start position:0%
person
um

00:44:26.309 --> 00:44:26.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:29.270 --> 00:44:29.280 align:start position:0%
as to how we help um
 
00:44:31.349 --> 00:44:31.359 align:start position:0%
the law enforcement
 
00:44:34.790 --> 00:44:34.800 align:start position:0%
we we don't really um
 
00:44:38.710 --> 00:44:38.720 align:start position:0%
we're not really in charge of um
 
00:44:41.670 --> 00:44:41.680 align:start position:0%
law enforcement ours ours is to pass the
 
00:44:44.870 --> 00:44:44.880 align:start position:0%
bills that allow the law enforcement to
 
00:44:46.950 --> 00:44:46.960 align:start position:0%
do what they need to do
 
00:44:49.270 --> 00:44:49.280 align:start position:0%
so um we don't
 
00:44:52.150 --> 00:44:52.160 align:start position:0%
take part in the actual law enforcement
 
00:44:54.790 --> 00:44:54.800 align:start position:0%
in and of itself now
 
00:44:57.990 --> 00:44:58.000 align:start position:0%
we could if law enforcement felt that
 
00:45:00.230 --> 00:45:00.240 align:start position:0%
they were not able to do their job
 
00:45:00.240 --> 00:45:01.270 align:start position:0%
they were not able to do their job
because

00:45:01.270 --> 00:45:01.280 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:45:03.510 --> 00:45:03.520 align:start position:0%
of a certain bill
 
00:45:05.349 --> 00:45:05.359 align:start position:0%
or they needed
 
00:45:06.950 --> 00:45:06.960 align:start position:0%
a bill clarified or they needed
 
00:45:10.069 --> 00:45:10.079 align:start position:0%
something else added to our our book
 
00:45:12.550 --> 00:45:12.560 align:start position:0%
there then they could certainly approach
 
00:45:15.109 --> 00:45:15.119 align:start position:0%
a representative to introduce that bill
 
00:45:17.190 --> 00:45:17.200 align:start position:0%
and that would help them it to do their
 
00:45:19.829 --> 00:45:19.839 align:start position:0%
job but we don't physically go out and
 
00:45:22.550 --> 00:45:22.560 align:start position:0%
and and do any law enforcement ourselves
 
00:45:23.990 --> 00:45:24.000 align:start position:0%
i'm sure
 
00:45:26.069 --> 00:45:26.079 align:start position:0%
as private citizens
 
00:45:28.790 --> 00:45:28.800 align:start position:0%
if we hear of um
 
00:45:31.270 --> 00:45:31.280 align:start position:0%
an act that is taking place that goes
 
00:45:34.309 --> 00:45:34.319 align:start position:0%
against our um rsas
 
00:45:37.030 --> 00:45:37.040 align:start position:0%
we could report it i personally have
 
00:45:40.069 --> 00:45:40.079 align:start position:0%
reported um deer that have been poached
 
00:45:42.550 --> 00:45:42.560 align:start position:0%
um to to fish and game and so forth and
 
00:45:44.870 --> 00:45:44.880 align:start position:0%
they they have investigated that but but
 
00:45:46.790 --> 00:45:46.800 align:start position:0%
that's just me doing it personally it's
 
00:45:49.510 --> 00:45:49.520 align:start position:0%
not me doing it as a member of fish and
 
00:45:52.150 --> 00:45:52.160 align:start position:0%
game committee or as a legislator i just
 
00:45:53.510 --> 00:45:53.520 align:start position:0%
knew that something happened in my
 
00:45:56.309 --> 00:45:56.319 align:start position:0%
community that was wrong
 
00:45:58.870 --> 00:45:58.880 align:start position:0%
and i took it upon myself to report it
 
00:45:58.880 --> 00:46:07.190 align:start position:0%
and i took it upon myself to report it
so

00:46:07.190 --> 00:46:07.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:09.670 --> 00:46:09.680 align:start position:0%
so just just so we're clear they're
 
00:46:11.910 --> 00:46:11.920 align:start position:0%
generally as a state representative or a
 
00:46:13.990 --> 00:46:14.000 align:start position:0%
state senator
 
00:46:15.990 --> 00:46:16.000 align:start position:0%
there are two ways a bill generally
 
00:46:18.870 --> 00:46:18.880 align:start position:0%
comes to us and a bill is just a request
 
00:46:22.309 --> 00:46:22.319 align:start position:0%
for a change in law it could be because
 
00:46:24.230 --> 00:46:24.240 align:start position:0%
the law was written 50 years ago and
 
00:46:25.829 --> 00:46:25.839 align:start position:0%
needs updating
 
00:46:29.349 --> 00:46:29.359 align:start position:0%
or it could be because um so for various
 
00:46:31.430 --> 00:46:31.440 align:start position:0%
reasons so generally we have citizens
 
00:46:32.950 --> 00:46:32.960 align:start position:0%
that'll bring us bills and say hey i
 
00:46:35.430 --> 00:46:35.440 align:start position:0%
tried to do this and i was told no
 
00:46:38.230 --> 00:46:38.240 align:start position:0%
and so we research that we decide
 
00:46:40.230 --> 00:46:40.240 align:start position:0%
whether or not we think that's worthy of
 
00:46:41.670 --> 00:46:41.680 align:start position:0%
a change in law
 
00:46:44.150 --> 00:46:44.160 align:start position:0%
and then we'll again submit a bill
 
00:46:47.030 --> 00:46:47.040 align:start position:0%
uh or request for for a law
 
00:46:49.349 --> 00:46:49.359 align:start position:0%
and then we hold public hearings on that
 
00:46:51.750 --> 00:46:51.760 align:start position:0%
the other way and the more common way we
 
00:46:54.870 --> 00:46:54.880 align:start position:0%
get um bills is from the agency in and
 
00:46:57.829 --> 00:46:57.839 align:start position:0%
of itself so again the agency recognizes
 
00:47:00.309 --> 00:47:00.319 align:start position:0%
there's an outdated law or a law that
 
00:47:02.470 --> 00:47:02.480 align:start position:0%
needs changes in order to help them with
 
00:47:02.480 --> 00:47:03.750 align:start position:0%
needs changes in order to help them with
enforcement

00:47:03.750 --> 00:47:03.760 align:start position:0%
enforcement
 
00:47:05.750 --> 00:47:05.760 align:start position:0%
and so they'll submit a request to us to
 
00:47:07.430 --> 00:47:07.440 align:start position:0%
one of the committee members
 
00:47:09.430 --> 00:47:09.440 align:start position:0%
or any state representative
 
00:47:11.589 --> 00:47:11.599 align:start position:0%
and say hey this
 
00:47:14.230 --> 00:47:14.240 align:start position:0%
current law is hindering us from doing
 
00:47:16.870 --> 00:47:16.880 align:start position:0%
this and if the committee member feels
 
00:47:18.630 --> 00:47:18.640 align:start position:0%
it's appropriate then we will submit a
 
00:47:21.270 --> 00:47:21.280 align:start position:0%
bill uh and and and have a public
 
00:47:23.750 --> 00:47:23.760 align:start position:0%
hearing on that change in law that'll
 
00:47:25.589 --> 00:47:25.599 align:start position:0%
allow them to further
 
00:47:27.750 --> 00:47:27.760 align:start position:0%
enforce and there's
 
00:47:29.910 --> 00:47:29.920 align:start position:0%
three steps basically in our our bill
 
00:47:32.069 --> 00:47:32.079 align:start position:0%
process the house of representatives
 
00:47:34.470 --> 00:47:34.480 align:start position:0%
which is the uh the ones they call the
 
00:47:35.670 --> 00:47:35.680 align:start position:0%
lower house
 
00:47:39.349 --> 00:47:39.359 align:start position:0%
first has a hearing here and then if we
 
00:47:41.430 --> 00:47:41.440 align:start position:0%
pass it we decide it's a good idea and
 
00:47:43.829 --> 00:47:43.839 align:start position:0%
we pass it it goes over to what's called
 
00:47:46.470 --> 00:47:46.480 align:start position:0%
the senate and the senate will then hear
 
00:47:47.670 --> 00:47:47.680 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
00:47:49.430 --> 00:47:49.440 align:start position:0%
if they think it's a good law they'll
 
00:47:50.630 --> 00:47:50.640 align:start position:0%
pass it
 
00:47:52.470 --> 00:47:52.480 align:start position:0%
then it goes to the governor of our
 
00:47:55.910 --> 00:47:55.920 align:start position:0%
state who then will sign it into law
 
00:47:57.829 --> 00:47:57.839 align:start position:0%
and then we'll allow the
 
00:47:59.750 --> 00:47:59.760 align:start position:0%
executive branch agency the fish and
 
00:48:01.990 --> 00:48:02.000 align:start position:0%
game division to be able to act on that
 
00:48:04.630 --> 00:48:04.640 align:start position:0%
law change the rules and regulations so
 
00:48:06.390 --> 00:48:06.400 align:start position:0%
just understand there's two there's a
 
00:48:08.390 --> 00:48:08.400 align:start position:0%
there's a public side or where the
 
00:48:11.589 --> 00:48:11.599 align:start position:0%
civilians can ask us for law changes and
 
00:48:13.349 --> 00:48:13.359 align:start position:0%
it's not uncommon for an agent the
 
00:48:15.510 --> 00:48:15.520 align:start position:0%
agency the enforcement agency to ask us
 
00:48:17.750 --> 00:48:17.760 align:start position:0%
for a change in law as well
 
00:48:20.230 --> 00:48:20.240 align:start position:0%
because they can't act and it may be
 
00:48:22.150 --> 00:48:22.160 align:start position:0%
something about a sp species that's
 
00:48:23.910 --> 00:48:23.920 align:start position:0%
changed and so therefore we need a law
 
00:48:26.150 --> 00:48:26.160 align:start position:0%
change it could be uh just again a
 
00:48:28.150 --> 00:48:28.160 align:start position:0%
modernization of an old law that they're
 
00:48:32.309 --> 00:48:32.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:34.950 --> 00:48:34.960 align:start position:0%
further questions we had the opportunity
 
00:48:37.510 --> 00:48:37.520 align:start position:0%
uh shortly after i came into office
 
00:48:41.510 --> 00:48:41.520 align:start position:0%
uh to modify a law that was set in 18
 
00:48:44.790 --> 00:48:44.800 align:start position:0%
was it 97 the bear damage
 
00:48:47.349 --> 00:48:47.359 align:start position:0%
yeah so we so we actually got to change
 
00:48:49.829 --> 00:48:49.839 align:start position:0%
a law that was written in the early or
 
00:48:52.870 --> 00:48:52.880 align:start position:0%
the late 1890s so that been around for a
 
00:48:54.630 --> 00:48:54.640 align:start position:0%
long time and it it
 
00:48:54.640 --> 00:48:55.750 align:start position:0%
long time and it it
it

00:48:55.750 --> 00:48:55.760 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:48:56.950 --> 00:48:56.960 align:start position:0%
somewhere along the line it was no
 
00:48:58.870 --> 00:48:58.880 align:start position:0%
longer being enforced the way that it
 
00:49:00.630 --> 00:49:00.640 align:start position:0%
was written in the law book
 
00:49:03.270 --> 00:49:03.280 align:start position:0%
so when we took a closer look at it um
 
00:49:03.280 --> 00:49:04.150 align:start position:0%
so when we took a closer look at it um
they

00:49:04.150 --> 00:49:04.160 align:start position:0%
they
 
00:49:06.230 --> 00:49:06.240 align:start position:0%
they put it into a bill and and changed
 
00:49:12.150 --> 00:49:12.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:15.030 --> 00:49:15.040 align:start position:0%
yes thanks uh folks so
 
00:49:18.230 --> 00:49:18.240 align:start position:0%
for the question me shushi samsudin and
 
00:49:20.549 --> 00:49:20.559 align:start position:0%
them uh elena
 
00:49:22.870 --> 00:49:22.880 align:start position:0%
uh my question is uh
 
00:49:24.950 --> 00:49:24.960 align:start position:0%
with regard to the
 
00:49:27.270 --> 00:49:27.280 align:start position:0%
this consultation
 
00:49:31.349 --> 00:49:31.359 align:start position:0%
who who is involved in this consultation
 
00:49:34.150 --> 00:49:34.160 align:start position:0%
does it require uh
 
00:49:36.309 --> 00:49:36.319 align:start position:0%
as it is a law
 
00:49:38.950 --> 00:49:38.960 align:start position:0%
in link with natural resource management
 
00:49:41.270 --> 00:49:41.280 align:start position:0%
does it require the involvement of
 
00:49:45.670 --> 00:49:45.680 align:start position:0%
university or researcher before it is
 
00:49:47.510 --> 00:49:47.520 align:start position:0%
before it will be presented to our
 
00:49:47.520 --> 00:49:49.270 align:start position:0%
before it will be presented to our
representative

00:49:49.270 --> 00:49:49.280 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:49:52.069 --> 00:49:52.079 align:start position:0%
and once uh accepted
 
00:49:52.079 --> 00:49:53.589 align:start position:0%
and once uh accepted
uh

00:49:53.589 --> 00:49:53.599 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:49:56.549 --> 00:49:56.559 align:start position:0%
who decided and how
 
00:49:59.910 --> 00:49:59.920 align:start position:0%
those law will be uh funded
 
00:50:02.790 --> 00:50:02.800 align:start position:0%
forever for the for their investment on
 
00:50:04.150 --> 00:50:04.160 align:start position:0%
the ground
 
00:50:07.190 --> 00:50:07.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:07.200 --> 00:50:09.589 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:50:09.589 --> 00:50:09.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:11.109 --> 00:50:11.119 align:start position:0%
we only brought one of our divisions
 
00:50:12.630 --> 00:50:12.640 align:start position:0%
today which is our law enforcement
 
00:50:15.030 --> 00:50:15.040 align:start position:0%
division but we do have a marine
 
00:50:17.589 --> 00:50:17.599 align:start position:0%
biologist a marine division we have an
 
00:50:18.950 --> 00:50:18.960 align:start position:0%
inland fisheries division with
 
00:50:21.190 --> 00:50:21.200 align:start position:0%
biologists and we also have a wildlife
 
00:50:23.510 --> 00:50:23.520 align:start position:0%
division with biologists and then a
 
00:50:26.790 --> 00:50:26.800 align:start position:0%
subsection of the wildlife division um
 
00:50:29.510 --> 00:50:29.520 align:start position:0%
it splits into two directions one being
 
00:50:31.670 --> 00:50:31.680 align:start position:0%
game animals animals we hunt and then
 
00:50:34.230 --> 00:50:34.240 align:start position:0%
the other one being non-game animals
 
00:50:35.990 --> 00:50:36.000 align:start position:0%
animals that we don't
 
00:50:37.910 --> 00:50:37.920 align:start position:0%
you know hunt and eat
 
00:50:37.920 --> 00:50:40.069 align:start position:0%
you know hunt and eat
um

00:50:40.069 --> 00:50:40.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:41.750 --> 00:50:41.760 align:start position:0%
so we have our internal
 
00:50:43.270 --> 00:50:43.280 align:start position:0%
biologists within the department
 
00:50:45.829 --> 00:50:45.839 align:start position:0%
themselves that do research monitor
 
00:50:48.390 --> 00:50:48.400 align:start position:0%
other research that's going on obviously
 
00:50:50.549 --> 00:50:50.559 align:start position:0%
you know a research project in vermont
 
00:50:53.430 --> 00:50:53.440 align:start position:0%
is going to end up with fairly similar
 
00:50:55.270 --> 00:50:55.280 align:start position:0%
results the one in new hampshire so our
 
00:50:57.190 --> 00:50:57.200 align:start position:0%
neighboring state
 
00:50:59.430 --> 00:50:59.440 align:start position:0%
so the research would probably be fairly
 
00:51:00.950 --> 00:51:00.960 align:start position:0%
similar you know the animals are
 
00:51:03.109 --> 00:51:03.119 align:start position:0%
traveling back and forth across state
 
00:51:04.710 --> 00:51:04.720 align:start position:0%
lines all the time
 
00:51:06.790 --> 00:51:06.800 align:start position:0%
um if you know and the fisheries are
 
00:51:09.910 --> 00:51:09.920 align:start position:0%
fairly similar um
 
00:51:12.069 --> 00:51:12.079 align:start position:0%
and then the third structure you talked
 
00:51:15.270 --> 00:51:15.280 align:start position:0%
about is our university system and we do
 
00:51:16.710 --> 00:51:16.720 align:start position:0%
quite often
 
00:51:19.190 --> 00:51:19.200 align:start position:0%
we cooperate with the university on a
 
00:51:23.349 --> 00:51:23.359 align:start position:0%
research project for example um we're
 
00:51:26.630 --> 00:51:26.640 align:start position:0%
changing our method of monitoring uh
 
00:51:26.640 --> 00:51:27.910 align:start position:0%
changing our method of monitoring uh
furbearers

00:51:27.910 --> 00:51:27.920 align:start position:0%
furbearers
 
00:51:30.630 --> 00:51:30.640 align:start position:0%
we've always looked at
 
00:51:32.470 --> 00:51:32.480 align:start position:0%
to try to decide what the current
 
00:51:34.309 --> 00:51:34.319 align:start position:0%
population of furbearers are we've
 
00:51:36.470 --> 00:51:36.480 align:start position:0%
always looked at the trapper
 
00:51:38.069 --> 00:51:38.079 align:start position:0%
effort uh
 
00:51:38.079 --> 00:51:40.069 align:start position:0%
effort uh
take

00:51:40.069 --> 00:51:40.079 align:start position:0%
take
 
00:51:40.079 --> 00:51:44.309 align:start position:0%
take
furbearers

00:51:44.309 --> 00:51:44.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:44.319 --> 00:51:45.349 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

00:51:45.349 --> 00:51:45.359 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:51:49.670 --> 00:51:49.680 align:start position:0%
sorry so like mink um muskrats those you
 
00:51:51.829 --> 00:51:51.839 align:start position:0%
know things that you would you'd turn
 
00:51:55.109 --> 00:51:55.119 align:start position:0%
into a fox or or whatnot
 
00:51:55.119 --> 00:51:56.630 align:start position:0%
into a fox or or whatnot
um

00:51:56.630 --> 00:51:56.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:51:59.190 --> 00:51:59.200 align:start position:0%
so traditionally what we had done is we
 
00:52:02.790 --> 00:52:02.800 align:start position:0%
had done surveys surveys of our trappers
 
00:52:04.710 --> 00:52:04.720 align:start position:0%
taking the hours that they were trapping
 
00:52:07.030 --> 00:52:07.040 align:start position:0%
versus what their take was to come up
 
00:52:10.309 --> 00:52:10.319 align:start position:0%
with and use that ratio to to try to
 
00:52:12.549 --> 00:52:12.559 align:start position:0%
predict what the population of the wild
 
00:52:14.710 --> 00:52:14.720 align:start position:0%
animal is in the in the field
 
00:52:17.030 --> 00:52:17.040 align:start position:0%
well recently we've started a program
 
00:52:18.790 --> 00:52:18.800 align:start position:0%
with the university of new hampshire
 
00:52:20.790 --> 00:52:20.800 align:start position:0%
where we're doing research on what they
 
00:52:23.910 --> 00:52:23.920 align:start position:0%
call camera traps using game cameras
 
00:52:26.309 --> 00:52:26.319 align:start position:0%
and and then
 
00:52:28.950 --> 00:52:28.960 align:start position:0%
a statistical analysis
 
00:52:31.109 --> 00:52:31.119 align:start position:0%
of putting these cameras out
 
00:52:33.510 --> 00:52:33.520 align:start position:0%
as randomly as possible and then coming
 
00:52:35.270 --> 00:52:35.280 align:start position:0%
back and trying to make predictions off
 
00:52:37.510 --> 00:52:37.520 align:start position:0%
the population obviously this will take
 
00:52:40.230 --> 00:52:40.240 align:start position:0%
multiple years to compare you know to
 
00:52:42.150 --> 00:52:42.160 align:start position:0%
compare numbers back and forth to try to
 
00:52:43.829 --> 00:52:43.839 align:start position:0%
come up and see if this is a
 
00:52:45.990 --> 00:52:46.000 align:start position:0%
reasonable way to
 
00:52:48.470 --> 00:52:48.480 align:start position:0%
predict the the population of the of the
 
00:52:48.480 --> 00:52:51.750 align:start position:0%
predict the the population of the of the
furbearers

00:52:51.750 --> 00:52:51.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:51.760 --> 00:52:52.630 align:start position:0%
 
in

00:52:52.630 --> 00:52:52.640 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:52:56.230 --> 00:52:56.240 align:start position:0%
during the uh sorry just coming so it is
 
00:52:59.030 --> 00:52:59.040 align:start position:0%
it is more science by science based
 
00:53:02.630 --> 00:53:02.640 align:start position:0%
decision or economic based decision
 
00:53:02.640 --> 00:53:04.150 align:start position:0%
decision or economic based decision
um

00:53:04.150 --> 00:53:04.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:04.160 --> 00:53:06.230 align:start position:0%
um
because

00:53:06.230 --> 00:53:06.240 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:53:08.150 --> 00:53:08.160 align:start position:0%
you know like our hunting
 
00:53:08.160 --> 00:53:09.829 align:start position:0%
you know like our hunting
um

00:53:09.829 --> 00:53:09.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:11.270 --> 00:53:11.280 align:start position:0%
all of our hunting in all of our inland
 
00:53:11.280 --> 00:53:12.549 align:start position:0%
all of our hunting in all of our inland
fisheries

00:53:12.549 --> 00:53:12.559 align:start position:0%
fisheries
 
00:53:15.750 --> 00:53:15.760 align:start position:0%
is is sport based so it's recreational
 
00:53:15.760 --> 00:53:16.710 align:start position:0%
is is sport based so it's recreational
based

00:53:16.710 --> 00:53:16.720 align:start position:0%
based
 
00:53:19.270 --> 00:53:19.280 align:start position:0%
so it's not the economics that that lead
 
00:53:21.030 --> 00:53:21.040 align:start position:0%
the decision it is the science and the
 
00:53:23.270 --> 00:53:23.280 align:start position:0%
conservation that leads the decision
 
00:53:25.589 --> 00:53:25.599 align:start position:0%
um when we get involved and we've
 
00:53:28.950 --> 00:53:28.960 align:start position:0%
carried that forth into the commercial
 
00:53:28.960 --> 00:53:31.430 align:start position:0%
carried that forth into the commercial
um

00:53:31.430 --> 00:53:31.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:33.270 --> 00:53:33.280 align:start position:0%
activities that go on which would be
 
00:53:34.950 --> 00:53:34.960 align:start position:0%
trapping because trappers are allowed to
 
00:53:37.589 --> 00:53:37.599 align:start position:0%
sell the furs as well as our
 
00:53:39.589 --> 00:53:39.599 align:start position:0%
offshore fishing
 
00:53:41.510 --> 00:53:41.520 align:start position:0%
conservation still leads the decision
 
00:53:42.710 --> 00:53:42.720 align:start position:0%
there too
 
00:53:42.720 --> 00:53:44.150 align:start position:0%
there too
um

00:53:44.150 --> 00:53:44.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:46.790 --> 00:53:46.800 align:start position:0%
but obviously
 
00:53:48.950 --> 00:53:48.960 align:start position:0%
you you you know dealing with the folks
 
00:53:50.870 --> 00:53:50.880 align:start position:0%
that are involved in this
 
00:53:50.880 --> 00:53:52.150 align:start position:0%
that are involved in this
um

00:53:52.150 --> 00:53:52.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:54.630 --> 00:53:54.640 align:start position:0%
well let me back up for a minute um
 
00:53:56.309 --> 00:53:56.319 align:start position:0%
give you a little family history my
 
00:53:57.670 --> 00:53:57.680 align:start position:0%
father was
 
00:54:00.309 --> 00:54:00.319 align:start position:0%
the second warden
 
00:54:02.390 --> 00:54:02.400 align:start position:0%
on the seacoast after we shut down
 
00:54:04.790 --> 00:54:04.800 align:start position:0%
commercial clamming
 
00:54:07.270 --> 00:54:07.280 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire so back in the 40s
 
00:54:09.910 --> 00:54:09.920 align:start position:0%
prior prior to i mean i think about 48
 
00:54:11.589 --> 00:54:11.599 align:start position:0%
is when they shut it down
 
00:54:12.790 --> 00:54:12.800 align:start position:0%
you had
 
00:54:14.950 --> 00:54:14.960 align:start position:0%
a lot of people on our seacoast that
 
00:54:17.589 --> 00:54:17.599 align:start position:0%
supported their family off of digging
 
00:54:17.599 --> 00:54:18.710 align:start position:0%
supported their family off of digging
clams

00:54:18.710 --> 00:54:18.720 align:start position:0%
clams
 
00:54:20.710 --> 00:54:20.720 align:start position:0%
and then shucking clams and selling
 
00:54:22.870 --> 00:54:22.880 align:start position:0%
canned clams all over the world
 
00:54:26.069 --> 00:54:26.079 align:start position:0%
and that market got shut down and
 
00:54:26.079 --> 00:54:26.870 align:start position:0%
and that market got shut down and
for

00:54:26.870 --> 00:54:26.880 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:54:29.750 --> 00:54:29.760 align:start position:0%
quite a period in the 40s and 50s that
 
00:54:31.349 --> 00:54:31.359 align:start position:0%
was a very contentious thing you had
 
00:54:32.710 --> 00:54:32.720 align:start position:0%
these these folks that have been
 
00:54:34.710 --> 00:54:34.720 align:start position:0%
involved with it for generations
 
00:54:37.109 --> 00:54:37.119 align:start position:0%
still illegally harvesting clams for
 
00:54:39.510 --> 00:54:39.520 align:start position:0%
sale so you go down to massachusetts and
 
00:54:42.150 --> 00:54:42.160 align:start position:0%
and dig clams and sell them uh so it's
 
00:54:44.950 --> 00:54:44.960 align:start position:0%
it's easy to sell the product um
 
00:54:46.390 --> 00:54:46.400 align:start position:0%
and it was a long you know it was a long
 
00:54:48.630 --> 00:54:48.640 align:start position:0%
going fight an ongoing fight that
 
00:54:51.750 --> 00:54:51.760 align:start position:0%
probably took 10 or 15 years to curb
 
00:54:53.349 --> 00:54:53.359 align:start position:0%
this um
 
00:54:55.270 --> 00:54:55.280 align:start position:0%
issue within within that that group of
 
00:54:55.280 --> 00:54:56.950 align:start position:0%
issue within within that that group of
folks

00:54:56.950 --> 00:54:56.960 align:start position:0%
folks
 
00:54:58.549 --> 00:54:58.559 align:start position:0%
and obviously
 
00:54:58.559 --> 00:54:59.670 align:start position:0%
and obviously
dealing

00:54:59.670 --> 00:54:59.680 align:start position:0%
dealing
 
00:55:01.670 --> 00:55:01.680 align:start position:0%
with the economic impacts of
 
00:55:01.680 --> 00:55:03.109 align:start position:0%
with the economic impacts of
conservation

00:55:03.109 --> 00:55:03.119 align:start position:0%
conservation
 
00:55:05.589 --> 00:55:05.599 align:start position:0%
you can't ignore that as you're trying
 
00:55:07.990 --> 00:55:08.000 align:start position:0%
to implement your new policies
 
00:55:09.430 --> 00:55:09.440 align:start position:0%
and trying to work with these people and
 
00:55:11.750 --> 00:55:11.760 align:start position:0%
getting past getting past that and
 
00:55:14.309 --> 00:55:14.319 align:start position:0%
giving them other alternatives for
 
00:55:16.309 --> 00:55:16.319 align:start position:0%
uh making a living other than
 
00:55:18.470 --> 00:55:18.480 align:start position:0%
the activity that they used to do is a
 
00:55:20.710 --> 00:55:20.720 align:start position:0%
very important part of that
 
00:55:23.589 --> 00:55:23.599 align:start position:0%
and i you know i i don't mean to pick on
 
00:55:25.270 --> 00:55:25.280 align:start position:0%
my major here but you know some of the
 
00:55:27.349 --> 00:55:27.359 align:start position:0%
stories my father used to tell
 
00:55:27.359 --> 00:55:29.349 align:start position:0%
stories my father used to tell
um

00:55:29.349 --> 00:55:29.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:55:31.190 --> 00:55:31.200 align:start position:0%
they would be involved in fist fights my
 
00:55:32.710 --> 00:55:32.720 align:start position:0%
father's been threatened with guns my
 
00:55:34.230 --> 00:55:34.240 align:start position:0%
father's been threatened with knives
 
00:55:34.240 --> 00:55:35.030 align:start position:0%
father's been threatened with knives
over

00:55:35.030 --> 00:55:35.040 align:start position:0%
over
 
00:55:36.870 --> 00:55:36.880 align:start position:0%
a bucket of clams
 
00:55:36.880 --> 00:55:38.390 align:start position:0%
a bucket of clams
so

00:55:38.390 --> 00:55:38.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:55:40.230 --> 00:55:40.240 align:start position:0%
what was that been back then
 
00:55:43.670 --> 00:55:43.680 align:start position:0%
less than a dollar it's worth a claim
 
00:55:44.789 --> 00:55:44.799 align:start position:0%
so it
 
00:55:45.750 --> 00:55:45.760 align:start position:0%
but it
 
00:55:47.829 --> 00:55:47.839 align:start position:0%
because of that history they took it
 
00:55:50.789 --> 00:55:50.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:53.109 --> 00:55:53.119 align:start position:0%
so one of the things i will say
 
00:55:55.349 --> 00:55:55.359 align:start position:0%
uh relative to this conversation is
 
00:55:55.359 --> 00:55:56.549 align:start position:0%
uh relative to this conversation is
around

00:55:56.549 --> 00:55:56.559 align:start position:0%
around
 
00:55:58.710 --> 00:55:58.720 align:start position:0%
conservation versus commercialization
 
00:56:01.349 --> 00:56:01.359 align:start position:0%
and that balance
 
00:56:03.190 --> 00:56:03.200 align:start position:0%
in the case of laws
 
00:56:05.750 --> 00:56:05.760 align:start position:0%
we have a when we have a public hearing
 
00:56:07.030 --> 00:56:07.040 align:start position:0%
for a law
 
00:56:08.710 --> 00:56:08.720 align:start position:0%
um citizens are more than welcome to
 
00:56:10.630 --> 00:56:10.640 align:start position:0%
come we have a gentleman from guilford
 
00:56:13.750 --> 00:56:13.760 align:start position:0%
who's a retired biologist and he attends
 
00:56:15.510 --> 00:56:15.520 align:start position:0%
on a regular basis and he's he's a
 
00:56:17.589 --> 00:56:17.599 align:start position:0%
conservationist he very much believes in
 
00:56:20.150 --> 00:56:20.160 align:start position:0%
conservation of of wildlife
 
00:56:20.160 --> 00:56:21.030 align:start position:0%
conservation of of wildlife
um

00:56:21.030 --> 00:56:21.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:56:22.789 --> 00:56:22.799 align:start position:0%
and they're all given equal say to have
 
00:56:25.109 --> 00:56:25.119 align:start position:0%
a conversation we've had to depart
 
00:56:26.710 --> 00:56:26.720 align:start position:0%
again the university system come in and
 
00:56:28.390 --> 00:56:28.400 align:start position:0%
speak at a public hearing on a law
 
00:56:28.400 --> 00:56:29.829 align:start position:0%
speak at a public hearing on a law
change

00:56:29.829 --> 00:56:29.839 align:start position:0%
change
 
00:56:30.789 --> 00:56:30.799 align:start position:0%
we have
 
00:56:32.789 --> 00:56:32.799 align:start position:0%
citizens come in on for various reasons
 
00:56:34.630 --> 00:56:34.640 align:start position:0%
to come in and speak in favor or opposed
 
00:56:36.470 --> 00:56:36.480 align:start position:0%
to a law change so it goes through a
 
00:56:39.190 --> 00:56:39.200 align:start position:0%
very deep vetting process in both the
 
00:56:41.430 --> 00:56:41.440 align:start position:0%
house and the senate
 
00:56:44.069 --> 00:56:44.079 align:start position:0%
but even with the agency over here on
 
00:56:45.910 --> 00:56:45.920 align:start position:0%
the regulatory side when they create
 
00:56:48.069 --> 00:56:48.079 align:start position:0%
regulations before they can change the
 
00:56:50.309 --> 00:56:50.319 align:start position:0%
regulation they're required also to have
 
00:56:52.630 --> 00:56:52.640 align:start position:0%
a public hearing and to have citizens
 
00:56:54.470 --> 00:56:54.480 align:start position:0%
come in and people who are involved
 
00:56:56.390 --> 00:56:56.400 align:start position:0%
either the industry
 
00:56:58.150 --> 00:56:58.160 align:start position:0%
or just a private citizen come in and
 
00:57:00.309 --> 00:57:00.319 align:start position:0%
speak to them about what the impact of
 
00:57:02.230 --> 00:57:02.240 align:start position:0%
that regulatory change is going to mean
 
00:57:04.630 --> 00:57:04.640 align:start position:0%
to them and then it's their job to
 
00:57:07.750 --> 00:57:07.760 align:start position:0%
balance and weigh that prof uh the the
 
00:57:09.910 --> 00:57:09.920 align:start position:0%
different versions of what people want
 
00:57:11.430 --> 00:57:11.440 align:start position:0%
and come out with what's best for new
 
00:57:13.829 --> 00:57:13.839 align:start position:0%
hampshire again i'll say that they
 
00:57:15.109 --> 00:57:15.119 align:start position:0%
generally always lean on the
 
00:57:17.190 --> 00:57:17.200 align:start position:0%
conservation side which is good to
 
00:57:19.430 --> 00:57:19.440 align:start position:0%
preserve our our uh wildlife and
 
00:57:21.190 --> 00:57:21.200 align:start position:0%
fisheries management to make sure we
 
00:57:22.870 --> 00:57:22.880 align:start position:0%
have a sustainable program that'll go
 
00:57:24.630 --> 00:57:24.640 align:start position:0%
forward and not just deplete it for the
 
00:57:27.190 --> 00:57:27.200 align:start position:0%
short term money so they've done a great
 
00:57:34.870 --> 00:57:34.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:37.270 --> 00:57:37.280 align:start position:0%
any further questions or comments or
 
00:57:42.549 --> 00:57:42.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:44.870 --> 00:57:44.880 align:start position:0%
yes um
 
00:57:47.430 --> 00:57:47.440 align:start position:0%
i am really enjoying the discussions we
 
00:57:47.440 --> 00:57:48.470 align:start position:0%
i am really enjoying the discussions we
haven't

00:57:48.470 --> 00:57:48.480 align:start position:0%
haven't
 
00:57:51.910 --> 00:57:51.920 align:start position:0%
yeah but then my simple question is
 
00:57:55.190 --> 00:57:55.200 align:start position:0%
um i want to know if the regulators
 
00:57:58.549 --> 00:57:58.559 align:start position:0%
they do have fisheries background
 
00:58:00.549 --> 00:58:00.559 align:start position:0%
either maybe master's degree in
 
00:58:00.559 --> 00:58:01.670 align:start position:0%
either maybe master's degree in
fisheries

00:58:01.670 --> 00:58:01.680 align:start position:0%
fisheries
 
00:58:04.309 --> 00:58:04.319 align:start position:0%
undergraduate studies or any kind of
 
00:58:07.510 --> 00:58:07.520 align:start position:0%
you know fisheries program
 
00:58:11.109 --> 00:58:11.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:13.109 --> 00:58:13.119 align:start position:0%
let me let me come again the background
 
00:58:14.950 --> 00:58:14.960 align:start position:0%
of the biologist not the background of
 
00:58:16.630 --> 00:58:16.640 align:start position:0%
the regulators
 
00:58:18.950 --> 00:58:18.960 align:start position:0%
of the regulators exactly
 
00:58:20.390 --> 00:58:20.400 align:start position:0%
do they have some kind of history's
 
00:58:20.400 --> 00:58:23.190 align:start position:0%
do they have some kind of history's
background

00:58:23.190 --> 00:58:23.200 align:start position:0%
background
 
00:58:25.750 --> 00:58:25.760 align:start position:0%
not necessarily with the law enforcement
 
00:58:27.910 --> 00:58:27.920 align:start position:0%
no not with law enforcement um we are
 
00:58:29.510 --> 00:58:29.520 align:start position:0%
required to have either a degree or
 
00:58:31.430 --> 00:58:31.440 align:start position:0%
experience in law enforcement it's
 
00:58:33.349 --> 00:58:33.359 align:start position:0%
recommended we have something either
 
00:58:34.789 --> 00:58:34.799 align:start position:0%
official wildlife but it's not a
 
00:58:36.470 --> 00:58:36.480 align:start position:0%
mandatory but to be a fisheries
 
00:58:38.069 --> 00:58:38.079 align:start position:0%
biologist they have to have a master's
 
00:58:39.750 --> 00:58:39.760 align:start position:0%
degree in fisheries
 
00:58:41.670 --> 00:58:41.680 align:start position:0%
uh to be a wildlife biologist they have
 
00:58:44.470 --> 00:58:44.480 align:start position:0%
to have a master's degree in in biology
 
00:58:47.030 --> 00:58:47.040 align:start position:0%
or wildlife management um let me but
 
00:58:49.589 --> 00:58:49.599 align:start position:0%
it's not a mandatory for the regulators
 
00:58:49.599 --> 00:58:50.789 align:start position:0%
it's not a mandatory for the regulators
right

00:58:50.789 --> 00:58:50.799 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:58:52.549 --> 00:58:52.559 align:start position:0%
for enforcement no enforcement and
 
00:58:55.349 --> 00:58:55.359 align:start position:0%
regulators uh or the legislature
 
00:58:57.349 --> 00:58:57.359 align:start position:0%
legislature yeah no not really a
 
00:58:59.750 --> 00:58:59.760 align:start position:0%
mandatory okay and again i want to know
 
00:58:59.760 --> 00:59:00.710 align:start position:0%
mandatory okay and again i want to know
if

00:59:00.710 --> 00:59:00.720 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:59:02.630 --> 00:59:02.640 align:start position:0%
what what approach
 
00:59:04.870 --> 00:59:04.880 align:start position:0%
do you in most cases use
 
00:59:07.430 --> 00:59:07.440 align:start position:0%
do you use the top bottom approach or
 
00:59:07.440 --> 00:59:08.470 align:start position:0%
do you use the top bottom approach or
the

00:59:08.470 --> 00:59:08.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:59:11.510 --> 00:59:11.520 align:start position:0%
um bottom top approach
 
00:59:13.349 --> 00:59:13.359 align:start position:0%
in trying to execute you know some of
 
00:59:13.359 --> 00:59:14.230 align:start position:0%
in trying to execute you know some of
these

00:59:14.230 --> 00:59:14.240 align:start position:0%
these
 
00:59:17.349 --> 00:59:17.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:19.109 --> 00:59:19.119 align:start position:0%
so if i get again
 
00:59:21.910 --> 00:59:21.920 align:start position:0%
a lot of the times our law and our
 
00:59:24.390 --> 00:59:24.400 align:start position:0%
regulatory happens because a citizen
 
00:59:25.990 --> 00:59:26.000 align:start position:0%
bubbled up an issue
 
00:59:27.829 --> 00:59:27.839 align:start position:0%
right they had a problem they had they
 
00:59:29.589 --> 00:59:29.599 align:start position:0%
saw something they didn't like
 
00:59:32.630 --> 00:59:32.640 align:start position:0%
or were involved themselves in something
 
00:59:34.710 --> 00:59:34.720 align:start position:0%
um so i'll give you an example scott
 
00:59:37.109 --> 00:59:37.119 align:start position:0%
won't like this one the director but
 
00:59:39.589 --> 00:59:39.599 align:start position:0%
so this year we had a citizen come
 
00:59:41.990 --> 00:59:42.000 align:start position:0%
forward with a had a problem with
 
00:59:44.470 --> 00:59:44.480 align:start position:0%
dealing with the agency and there was no
 
00:59:46.870 --> 00:59:46.880 align:start position:0%
appeals process for the ruling
 
00:59:48.390 --> 00:59:48.400 align:start position:0%
of the agency
 
00:59:49.829 --> 00:59:49.839 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:59:51.270 --> 00:59:51.280 align:start position:0%
they brought the bill to me they brought
 
00:59:54.069 --> 00:59:54.079 align:start position:0%
it to me and so i put a bill in saying
 
00:59:55.589 --> 00:59:55.599 align:start position:0%
every citizen should have the right to
 
00:59:57.349 --> 00:59:57.359 align:start position:0%
an appeal and administrative decision if
 
00:59:59.030 --> 00:59:59.040 align:start position:0%
someone makes a ruling you can't let it
 
01:00:00.470 --> 01:00:00.480 align:start position:0%
just stop there
 
01:00:03.030 --> 01:00:03.040 align:start position:0%
so we put a bill together and we should
 
01:00:04.630 --> 01:00:04.640 align:start position:0%
vote on it and it should become law
 
01:00:06.390 --> 01:00:06.400 align:start position:0%
hopefully soon
 
01:00:09.670 --> 01:00:09.680 align:start position:0%
and it was just that it just created
 
01:00:11.589 --> 01:00:11.599 align:start position:0%
an appeals process from a regulatory
 
01:00:14.309 --> 01:00:14.319 align:start position:0%
decision and allow that process to occur
 
01:00:15.589 --> 01:00:15.599 align:start position:0%
because that was what was in the best
 
01:00:17.510 --> 01:00:17.520 align:start position:0%
interest of the citizen so there was a
 
01:00:19.670 --> 01:00:19.680 align:start position:0%
case of a bottom-up bubble bubbling up
 
01:00:26.710 --> 01:00:26.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:26.720 --> 01:00:30.549 align:start position:0%
 
good

01:00:30.549 --> 01:00:30.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:32.150 --> 01:00:32.160 align:start position:0%
first thank you
 
01:00:33.750 --> 01:00:33.760 align:start position:0%
uh so
 
01:00:33.760 --> 01:00:34.630 align:start position:0%
uh so
um

01:00:34.630 --> 01:00:34.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:00:36.950 --> 01:00:36.960 align:start position:0%
when you talk about the experience level
 
01:00:36.960 --> 01:00:38.470 align:start position:0%
when you talk about the experience level
of

01:00:38.470 --> 01:00:38.480 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:00:40.829 --> 01:00:40.839 align:start position:0%
either law enforcement or the
 
01:00:44.870 --> 01:00:44.880 align:start position:0%
legislators we see bills on all kinds of
 
01:00:47.349 --> 01:00:47.359 align:start position:0%
different subjects in the house
 
01:00:49.510 --> 01:00:49.520 align:start position:0%
here in the here in the committee we see
 
01:00:51.270 --> 01:00:51.280 align:start position:0%
fish and game bills but in the house we
 
01:00:54.150 --> 01:00:54.160 align:start position:0%
see all kinds of bills so
 
01:00:56.390 --> 01:00:56.400 align:start position:0%
no we don't have experience
 
01:00:59.190 --> 01:00:59.200 align:start position:0%
in all of the topics that are brought
 
01:01:01.589 --> 01:01:01.599 align:start position:0%
forward to us but that's why
 
01:01:03.829 --> 01:01:03.839 align:start position:0%
the um hearings in the committee room
 
01:01:06.150 --> 01:01:06.160 align:start position:0%
are so very important and we really
 
01:01:08.630 --> 01:01:08.640 align:start position:0%
encourage people to come and talk to us
 
01:01:10.870 --> 01:01:10.880 align:start position:0%
because they're the ones that
 
01:01:12.870 --> 01:01:12.880 align:start position:0%
do have the experience and so we listen
 
01:01:16.150 --> 01:01:16.160 align:start position:0%
not just to um citizens we listen to
 
01:01:18.789 --> 01:01:18.799 align:start position:0%
lobbyists we encourage um you know
 
01:01:21.030 --> 01:01:21.040 align:start position:0%
people to reach out to us in in any way
 
01:01:23.430 --> 01:01:23.440 align:start position:0%
rather phone calls or whatever if we're
 
01:01:26.549 --> 01:01:26.559 align:start position:0%
having a a particularly uh contentious
 
01:01:29.030 --> 01:01:29.040 align:start position:0%
build one that people feel very strongly
 
01:01:31.910 --> 01:01:31.920 align:start position:0%
about one way or the other i will get as
 
01:01:34.390 --> 01:01:34.400 align:start position:0%
many as 300 emails a day
 
01:01:35.750 --> 01:01:35.760 align:start position:0%
so um
 
01:01:37.109 --> 01:01:37.119 align:start position:0%
so that's
 
01:01:40.549 --> 01:01:40.559 align:start position:0%
and and i like that you know i i do
 
01:01:42.309 --> 01:01:42.319 align:start position:0%
because it it tells me what the people
 
01:01:43.510 --> 01:01:43.520 align:start position:0%
are thinking
 
01:01:47.270 --> 01:01:47.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:49.270 --> 01:01:49.280 align:start position:0%
so again
 
01:01:51.670 --> 01:01:51.680 align:start position:0%
my background's in technology i'm an i.t
 
01:01:53.349 --> 01:01:53.359 align:start position:0%
manager for a living that's what i do
 
01:01:54.870 --> 01:01:54.880 align:start position:0%
but i'm the chair of the house fish and
 
01:01:57.029 --> 01:01:57.039 align:start position:0%
game committee um
 
01:01:57.039 --> 01:01:57.990 align:start position:0%
game committee um
so

01:01:57.990 --> 01:01:58.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:01:59.589 --> 01:01:59.599 align:start position:0%
in the case of the other going the other
 
01:02:01.430 --> 01:02:01.440 align:start position:0%
direction is one of the things we
 
01:02:04.549 --> 01:02:04.559 align:start position:0%
learned in our in our hunting season for
 
01:02:06.710 --> 01:02:06.720 align:start position:0%
our recreational hunting um there were
 
01:02:10.069 --> 01:02:10.079 align:start position:0%
some rules that were just problematic um
 
01:02:12.789 --> 01:02:12.799 align:start position:0%
i'll use one of i use the pistol is my
 
01:02:14.950 --> 01:02:14.960 align:start position:0%
favorite one right so we had a rule that
 
01:02:15.990 --> 01:02:16.000 align:start position:0%
said that
 
01:02:17.510 --> 01:02:17.520 align:start position:0%
if you were hunting and carrying a
 
01:02:19.349 --> 01:02:19.359 align:start position:0%
handgun a pistol
 
01:02:21.670 --> 01:02:21.680 align:start position:0%
for the purposes of self-defense
 
01:02:24.470 --> 01:02:24.480 align:start position:0%
you could have six rounds of the gun
 
01:02:24.480 --> 01:02:25.670 align:start position:0%
you could have six rounds of the gun
however

01:02:25.670 --> 01:02:25.680 align:start position:0%
however
 
01:02:27.270 --> 01:02:27.280 align:start position:0%
if you were
 
01:02:29.430 --> 01:02:29.440 align:start position:0%
hunting with a pistol you were only
 
01:02:31.829 --> 01:02:31.839 align:start position:0%
allowed to have five rounds in the gun
 
01:02:34.549 --> 01:02:34.559 align:start position:0%
didn't make sense right so so this was
 
01:02:36.230 --> 01:02:36.240 align:start position:0%
an agency kind of came to us we had a
 
01:02:38.309 --> 01:02:38.319 align:start position:0%
conversation and we said let's make this
 
01:02:40.870 --> 01:02:40.880 align:start position:0%
more uniform right and so we we
 
01:02:43.029 --> 01:02:43.039 align:start position:0%
we set everything at six so it was clean
 
01:02:44.870 --> 01:02:44.880 align:start position:0%
but for some reason back whenever they
 
01:02:47.109 --> 01:02:47.119 align:start position:0%
said it that was the way they said it
 
01:02:48.870 --> 01:02:48.880 align:start position:0%
but we recognized that it created a
 
01:02:50.870 --> 01:02:50.880 align:start position:0%
problem for our law enforcement officers
 
01:02:52.870 --> 01:02:52.880 align:start position:0%
enforcing that because how do you tell
 
01:02:54.549 --> 01:02:54.559 align:start position:0%
whether the gun on a hip is being used
 
01:02:55.829 --> 01:02:55.839 align:start position:0%
for hunting you're being used for
 
01:02:57.829 --> 01:02:57.839 align:start position:0%
protection so are you
 
01:02:59.349 --> 01:02:59.359 align:start position:0%
what do you do with that right so there
 
01:03:01.829 --> 01:03:01.839 align:start position:0%
was a case where we cleaned law up and
 
01:03:03.910 --> 01:03:03.920 align:start position:0%
made it more uniform to make it easier
 
01:03:05.910 --> 01:03:05.920 align:start position:0%
for citizens to follow the law and not
 
01:03:14.470 --> 01:03:14.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:17.270 --> 01:03:17.280 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and the members for
 
01:03:19.349 --> 01:03:19.359 align:start position:0%
giving us this
 
01:03:21.670 --> 01:03:21.680 align:start position:0%
time to exchange with you
 
01:03:21.680 --> 01:03:22.950 align:start position:0%
time to exchange with you
so

01:03:22.950 --> 01:03:22.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:03:25.270 --> 01:03:25.280 align:start position:0%
my question will go
 
01:03:26.870 --> 01:03:26.880 align:start position:0%
i would like to know
 
01:03:29.670 --> 01:03:29.680 align:start position:0%
a little more about
 
01:03:29.680 --> 01:03:30.710 align:start position:0%
a little more about
how

01:03:30.710 --> 01:03:30.720 align:start position:0%
how
 
01:03:33.589 --> 01:03:33.599 align:start position:0%
is fishing works in your states uh and
 
01:03:36.630 --> 01:03:36.640 align:start position:0%
what kind of support you are giving to
 
01:03:39.109 --> 01:03:39.119 align:start position:0%
the community having said this because
 
01:03:39.119 --> 01:03:39.910 align:start position:0%
the community having said this because
uh

01:03:39.910 --> 01:03:39.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:03:43.430 --> 01:03:43.440 align:start position:0%
i haven't i have been working with the
 
01:03:45.670 --> 01:03:45.680 align:start position:0%
fishing communities and through my
 
01:03:48.950 --> 01:03:48.960 align:start position:0%
companies i have been provided
 
01:03:51.910 --> 01:03:51.920 align:start position:0%
community buildings and uh
 
01:03:56.150 --> 01:03:56.160 align:start position:0%
boats and fishing gears and equipments
 
01:03:58.390 --> 01:03:58.400 align:start position:0%
but at the end uh
 
01:03:58.400 --> 01:03:59.190 align:start position:0%
but at the end uh
uh

01:03:59.190 --> 01:03:59.200 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:04:02.309 --> 01:04:02.319 align:start position:0%
50 of 50 percent of them they are not
 
01:04:04.390 --> 01:04:04.400 align:start position:0%
they are not happy
 
01:04:05.829 --> 01:04:05.839 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
01:04:05.839 --> 01:04:07.029 align:start position:0%
and uh
sometime

01:04:07.029 --> 01:04:07.039 align:start position:0%
sometime
 
01:04:09.190 --> 01:04:09.200 align:start position:0%
i had the fighting
 
01:04:11.670 --> 01:04:11.680 align:start position:0%
with them so i would like to understand
 
01:04:13.270 --> 01:04:13.280 align:start position:0%
how it works
 
01:04:15.349 --> 01:04:15.359 align:start position:0%
what is the approach with
 
01:04:18.150 --> 01:04:18.160 align:start position:0%
you you have with your your fishing
 
01:04:20.470 --> 01:04:20.480 align:start position:0%
communities in order to get
 
01:04:20.480 --> 01:04:21.190 align:start position:0%
communities in order to get
uh

01:04:21.190 --> 01:04:21.200 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:04:25.029 --> 01:04:25.039 align:start position:0%
some information to implement to my my
 
01:04:27.190 --> 01:04:27.200 align:start position:0%
community because i'm working with the
 
01:04:31.670 --> 01:04:31.680 align:start position:0%
nine communities uh village and uh uh
 
01:04:34.390 --> 01:04:34.400 align:start position:0%
the total number is 150 fishermen that
 
01:04:35.990 --> 01:04:36.000 align:start position:0%
i'm working with them
 
01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:36.950 align:start position:0%
i'm working with them
so

01:04:36.950 --> 01:04:36.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:04:39.109 --> 01:04:39.119 align:start position:0%
the boats the fishing gears the
 
01:04:41.430 --> 01:04:41.440 align:start position:0%
equipments the committee buildings that
 
01:04:43.990 --> 01:04:44.000 align:start position:0%
is was free for them so it belongs to
 
01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:44.789 align:start position:0%
is was free for them so it belongs to
them

01:04:44.789 --> 01:04:44.799 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:04:46.950 --> 01:04:46.960 align:start position:0%
from the company but
 
01:04:48.630 --> 01:04:48.640 align:start position:0%
once they go for fishing the the
 
01:04:51.430 --> 01:04:51.440 align:start position:0%
condition was that once you come from
 
01:04:55.109 --> 01:04:55.119 align:start position:0%
there they see 60 of the harvest
 
01:04:57.190 --> 01:04:57.200 align:start position:0%
has to be
 
01:05:00.150 --> 01:05:00.160 align:start position:0%
bought by the company for a low price
 
01:05:03.510 --> 01:05:03.520 align:start position:0%
then the 4.4 40 percent you can either
 
01:05:05.829 --> 01:05:05.839 align:start position:0%
sell to the company or you can
 
01:05:06.710 --> 01:05:06.720 align:start position:0%
go to
 
01:05:09.750 --> 01:05:09.760 align:start position:0%
eat on your home or sell to your your
 
01:05:12.230 --> 01:05:12.240 align:start position:0%
your communities but they have never
 
01:05:12.240 --> 01:05:13.029 align:start position:0%
your communities but they have never
beat

01:05:13.029 --> 01:05:13.039 align:start position:0%
beat
 
01:05:14.470 --> 01:05:14.480 align:start position:0%
uh or
 
01:05:15.910 --> 01:05:15.920 align:start position:0%
miss uh
 
01:05:18.309 --> 01:05:18.319 align:start position:0%
traceability between them uh between
 
01:05:20.230 --> 01:05:20.240 align:start position:0%
them sometimes they come they say we
 
01:05:23.510 --> 01:05:23.520 align:start position:0%
don't have we didn't catch anything but
 
01:05:25.910 --> 01:05:25.920 align:start position:0%
uh back in formation we find that they
 
01:05:29.430 --> 01:05:29.440 align:start position:0%
got some catch so i had facing all these
 
01:05:31.750 --> 01:05:31.760 align:start position:0%
issues then
 
01:05:33.910 --> 01:05:33.920 align:start position:0%
i'm very happy to be
 
01:05:36.390 --> 01:05:36.400 align:start position:0%
with you and get some advice regarding
 
01:05:41.829 --> 01:05:41.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:41.839 --> 01:05:44.309 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:05:44.309 --> 01:05:44.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:44.319 --> 01:05:44.550 align:start position:0%
 
we

01:05:44.550 --> 01:05:44.560 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:05:44.560 --> 01:05:46.230 align:start position:0%
we
[Music]

01:05:46.230 --> 01:05:46.240 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:05:48.870 --> 01:05:48.880 align:start position:0%
we actually don't get involved in that
 
01:05:51.589 --> 01:05:51.599 align:start position:0%
part of it as far as the business side
 
01:05:54.069 --> 01:05:54.079 align:start position:0%
of of the commercial fishing
 
01:05:54.079 --> 01:05:55.109 align:start position:0%
of of the commercial fishing
um

01:05:55.109 --> 01:05:55.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:05:57.510 --> 01:05:57.520 align:start position:0%
we would be we just enforce the rules
 
01:05:59.349 --> 01:05:59.359 align:start position:0%
like like on a lobster you know your
 
01:06:00.950 --> 01:06:00.960 align:start position:0%
lobster has to be
 
01:06:02.470 --> 01:06:02.480 align:start position:0%
the body of the lobster has to be so
 
01:06:04.549 --> 01:06:04.559 align:start position:0%
long before you can keep it so we will
 
01:06:06.230 --> 01:06:06.240 align:start position:0%
go on the boats making sure that the
 
01:06:08.470 --> 01:06:08.480 align:start position:0%
catch is legal that that kind of
 
01:06:08.480 --> 01:06:11.349 align:start position:0%
catch is legal that that kind of
activity

01:06:11.349 --> 01:06:11.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:13.430 --> 01:06:13.440 align:start position:0%
in general
 
01:06:15.430 --> 01:06:15.440 align:start position:0%
i would dare say that most of our
 
01:06:17.349 --> 01:06:17.359 align:start position:0%
fishermen are small independent
 
01:06:19.510 --> 01:06:19.520 align:start position:0%
businessmen themselves they they've
 
01:06:21.510 --> 01:06:21.520 align:start position:0%
bought the boat themselves
 
01:06:21.520 --> 01:06:22.549 align:start position:0%
bought the boat themselves
um

01:06:22.549 --> 01:06:22.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:25.430 --> 01:06:25.440 align:start position:0%
the docks tend to be municipal owned
 
01:06:27.190 --> 01:06:27.200 align:start position:0%
would that be right correct
 
01:06:29.510 --> 01:06:29.520 align:start position:0%
um so they're owned by the local town
 
01:06:29.520 --> 01:06:31.029 align:start position:0%
um so they're owned by the local town
there

01:06:31.029 --> 01:06:31.039 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:06:33.750 --> 01:06:33.760 align:start position:0%
sometimes like in seabrook that was a
 
01:06:36.069 --> 01:06:36.079 align:start position:0%
that dock or that pier
 
01:06:38.309 --> 01:06:38.319 align:start position:0%
is owned by the town but it's rented to
 
01:06:41.589 --> 01:06:41.599 align:start position:0%
a local fisherman's co-op so they they
 
01:06:43.430 --> 01:06:43.440 align:start position:0%
come together as these small independent
 
01:06:45.750 --> 01:06:45.760 align:start position:0%
businessmen come together into a co-op
 
01:06:48.390 --> 01:06:48.400 align:start position:0%
and they manage that doc they manage the
 
01:06:50.549 --> 01:06:50.559 align:start position:0%
facilities there
 
01:06:52.870 --> 01:06:52.880 align:start position:0%
as things have progressed in the
 
01:06:55.190 --> 01:06:55.200 align:start position:0%
marketing they've actually developed a
 
01:06:57.109 --> 01:06:57.119 align:start position:0%
local retail market
 
01:06:59.190 --> 01:06:59.200 align:start position:0%
so the co-op
 
01:07:01.430 --> 01:07:01.440 align:start position:0%
supplies the dock
 
01:07:03.750 --> 01:07:03.760 align:start position:0%
as a member you you kind of pay in and
 
01:07:06.390 --> 01:07:06.400 align:start position:0%
buy into the ownership of that
 
01:07:08.549 --> 01:07:08.559 align:start position:0%
but they supply the dock they also
 
01:07:11.670 --> 01:07:11.680 align:start position:0%
supply marketing for your catch but
 
01:07:13.670 --> 01:07:13.680 align:start position:0%
you as a member of the co-op you don't
 
01:07:16.069 --> 01:07:16.079 align:start position:0%
have to sell your catch to them you can
 
01:07:17.349 --> 01:07:17.359 align:start position:0%
you know i was talking to a gentleman
 
01:07:19.270 --> 01:07:19.280 align:start position:0%
the other day he loads his catch every
 
01:07:20.870 --> 01:07:20.880 align:start position:0%
time he comes in he loads it on a truck
 
01:07:22.950 --> 01:07:22.960 align:start position:0%
and takes it to massachusetts and sells
 
01:07:24.230 --> 01:07:24.240 align:start position:0%
it down there because he doesn't believe
 
01:07:26.870 --> 01:07:26.880 align:start position:0%
he can get a good price in new hampshire
 
01:07:28.870 --> 01:07:28.880 align:start position:0%
so that type of activity happens but
 
01:07:31.430 --> 01:07:31.440 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a little different as far as
 
01:07:33.109 --> 01:07:33.119 align:start position:0%
how we manage
 
01:07:33.119 --> 01:07:34.549 align:start position:0%
how we manage
um

01:07:34.549 --> 01:07:34.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:07:36.150 --> 01:07:36.160 align:start position:0%
our interaction with uh with the
 
01:07:37.750 --> 01:07:37.760 align:start position:0%
fishermen we don't actually manage the
 
01:07:39.829 --> 01:07:39.839 align:start position:0%
economic side of it
 
01:07:41.670 --> 01:07:41.680 align:start position:0%
and i would add just add to that the
 
01:07:43.670 --> 01:07:43.680 align:start position:0%
director talked about how they're
 
01:07:46.870 --> 01:07:46.880 align:start position:0%
independent businessmen each boat and
 
01:07:48.230 --> 01:07:48.240 align:start position:0%
if there's a problem with somebody
 
01:07:50.230 --> 01:07:50.240 align:start position:0%
committing a violation on the commercial
 
01:07:51.829 --> 01:07:51.839 align:start position:0%
side of things
 
01:07:54.390 --> 01:07:54.400 align:start position:0%
the other fishermen view that as
 
01:07:56.470 --> 01:07:56.480 align:start position:0%
they're stealing from them so we're the
 
01:07:58.150 --> 01:07:58.160 align:start position:0%
last person to find out about it they
 
01:07:59.990 --> 01:08:00.000 align:start position:0%
kind of take care of things on their own
 
01:08:01.670 --> 01:08:01.680 align:start position:0%
and when they can't do that that's when
 
01:08:04.710 --> 01:08:04.720 align:start position:0%
they come to us it is not unusual well
 
01:08:07.349 --> 01:08:07.359 align:start position:0%
it is unusual but it's not unheard of
 
01:08:09.349 --> 01:08:09.359 align:start position:0%
for a boat to burn
 
01:08:10.549 --> 01:08:10.559 align:start position:0%
over the night
 
01:08:13.029 --> 01:08:13.039 align:start position:0%
and that usually is someone that has
 
01:08:14.789 --> 01:08:14.799 align:start position:0%
been stealing lobsters or committing
 
01:08:16.550 --> 01:08:16.560 align:start position:0%
lobster violations
 
01:08:18.630 --> 01:08:18.640 align:start position:0%
and some fisherman was fed up with it
 
01:08:19.829 --> 01:08:19.839 align:start position:0%
because he looked at it as they're
 
01:08:21.669 --> 01:08:21.679 align:start position:0%
taking money out of his pocket so
 
01:08:23.430 --> 01:08:23.440 align:start position:0%
usually we're the last ones that they
 
01:08:24.870 --> 01:08:24.880 align:start position:0%
complain to they try to take care of
 
01:08:26.470 --> 01:08:26.480 align:start position:0%
things on their own because it's they're
 
01:08:28.709 --> 01:08:28.719 align:start position:0%
losing money as well
 
01:08:28.719 --> 01:08:35.349 align:start position:0%
losing money as well
so

01:08:35.349 --> 01:08:35.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:38.550 --> 01:08:38.560 align:start position:0%
so i i will also say that there's in the
 
01:08:40.309 --> 01:08:40.319 align:start position:0%
united states with multiple states that
 
01:08:42.950 --> 01:08:42.960 align:start position:0%
we have uh on the atlantic seaboard
 
01:08:46.550 --> 01:08:46.560 align:start position:0%
there is um a group called and scott you
 
01:08:49.189 --> 01:08:49.199 align:start position:0%
can help me with this it's the uh the
 
01:08:51.349 --> 01:08:51.359 align:start position:0%
atlantic states marine fisheries
 
01:08:53.590 --> 01:08:53.600 align:start position:0%
commission which helps set catch limits
 
01:08:56.709 --> 01:08:56.719 align:start position:0%
if i'm not mistaken for the region so
 
01:08:59.110 --> 01:08:59.120 align:start position:0%
um we helped report the catch you know
 
01:09:01.349 --> 01:09:01.359 align:start position:0%
the the cooperatives that they were
 
01:09:03.510 --> 01:09:03.520 align:start position:0%
talking about private industry reports
 
01:09:06.229 --> 01:09:06.239 align:start position:0%
back to the in the uh the state and this
 
01:09:08.229 --> 01:09:08.239 align:start position:0%
helps us maintain sustainability across
 
01:09:10.630 --> 01:09:10.640 align:start position:0%
the entire eastern seaboard to make sure
 
01:09:12.550 --> 01:09:12.560 align:start position:0%
that new hampshire isn't you know just
 
01:09:15.110 --> 01:09:15.120 align:start position:0%
going to be a black hole no fish right
 
01:09:15.120 --> 01:09:15.829 align:start position:0%
going to be a black hole no fish right
so

01:09:15.829 --> 01:09:15.839 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:09:18.229 --> 01:09:18.239 align:start position:0%
again we we participate in regional
 
01:09:20.390 --> 01:09:20.400 align:start position:0%
cooperatives regional uh commissions
 
01:09:23.030 --> 01:09:23.040 align:start position:0%
that help set catch limits and then it's
 
01:09:25.110 --> 01:09:25.120 align:start position:0%
a self-reporting for the for the various
 
01:09:26.950 --> 01:09:26.960 align:start position:0%
fish cooperatives to report back to
 
01:09:29.110 --> 01:09:29.120 align:start position:0%
those to that um
 
01:09:31.910 --> 01:09:31.920 align:start position:0%
regulatory body that'll help maintain so
 
01:09:32.789 --> 01:09:32.799 align:start position:0%
if we
 
01:09:34.950 --> 01:09:34.960 align:start position:0%
over catch your lobster we'll use a good
 
01:09:36.870 --> 01:09:36.880 align:start position:0%
example they may pull back and say okay
 
01:09:38.470 --> 01:09:38.480 align:start position:0%
once you reach this limit you got to
 
01:09:39.590 --> 01:09:39.600 align:start position:0%
stop catching
 
01:09:41.189 --> 01:09:41.199 align:start position:0%
lobster and so they'll help maintain
 
01:09:43.349 --> 01:09:43.359 align:start position:0%
sustainability in the industry so it's
 
01:09:46.630 --> 01:09:46.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:49.349 --> 01:09:49.359 align:start position:0%
each state has its own quota
 
01:09:51.269 --> 01:09:51.279 align:start position:0%
so what happens sometimes if it's a fish
 
01:09:52.470 --> 01:09:52.480 align:start position:0%
that's not
 
01:09:52.480 --> 01:09:53.829 align:start position:0%
that's not
um

01:09:53.829 --> 01:09:53.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:09:55.030 --> 01:09:55.040 align:start position:0%
something that our fishermen aren't
 
01:09:57.270 --> 01:09:57.280 align:start position:0%
catching we will trade quotas off with
 
01:10:00.630 --> 01:10:00.640 align:start position:0%
other states to make sure that that
 
01:10:02.870 --> 01:10:02.880 align:start position:0%
that we you know our fishermen do get
 
01:10:05.110 --> 01:10:05.120 align:start position:0%
the the best ability to you know make a
 
01:10:08.149 --> 01:10:08.159 align:start position:0%
living without harming the resource
 
01:10:08.159 --> 01:10:14.390 align:start position:0%
living without harming the resource
so

01:10:14.390 --> 01:10:14.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:14.400 --> 01:10:15.430 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:10:15.430 --> 01:10:15.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:10:15.440 --> 01:10:16.709 align:start position:0%
um
hello

01:10:16.709 --> 01:10:16.719 align:start position:0%
hello
 
01:10:19.350 --> 01:10:19.360 align:start position:0%
ileana from uh calvert
 
01:10:19.360 --> 01:10:21.750 align:start position:0%
ileana from uh calvert
um

01:10:21.750 --> 01:10:21.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:10:21.760 --> 01:10:24.470 align:start position:0%
um
okay

01:10:24.470 --> 01:10:24.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:25.830 --> 01:10:25.840 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:10:27.590 --> 01:10:27.600 align:start position:0%
like tommy said
 
01:10:27.600 --> 01:10:28.630 align:start position:0%
like tommy said
um

01:10:28.630 --> 01:10:28.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:10:31.189 --> 01:10:31.199 align:start position:0%
we can promote the fishing games back
 
01:10:34.229 --> 01:10:34.239 align:start position:0%
home and i truly believe that
 
01:10:37.030 --> 01:10:37.040 align:start position:0%
we have all the condition conditions to
 
01:10:38.630 --> 01:10:38.640 align:start position:0%
to do that so
 
01:10:42.310 --> 01:10:42.320 align:start position:0%
uh i want to to know um
 
01:10:45.270 --> 01:10:45.280 align:start position:0%
how do you start the big games here in
 
01:10:48.390 --> 01:10:48.400 align:start position:0%
new hampshire and what were the the
 
01:10:48.400 --> 01:10:49.510 align:start position:0%
new hampshire and what were the the
steps

01:10:49.510 --> 01:10:49.520 align:start position:0%
steps
 
01:10:53.750 --> 01:10:53.760 align:start position:0%
you you you took to be where you are now
 
01:10:56.229 --> 01:10:56.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:57.590 --> 01:10:57.600 align:start position:0%
can you repeat the beginning of that
 
01:10:59.270 --> 01:10:59.280 align:start position:0%
question i apologize i'm a little hard
 
01:11:02.630 --> 01:11:02.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:05.270 --> 01:11:05.280 align:start position:0%
now i said that uh
 
01:11:07.189 --> 01:11:07.199 align:start position:0%
back in home in cabo verde we can
 
01:11:10.550 --> 01:11:10.560 align:start position:0%
promote fishing games uh fishing games
 
01:11:13.189 --> 01:11:13.199 align:start position:0%
and uh i think we have all the condition
 
01:11:15.030 --> 01:11:15.040 align:start position:0%
conditions to do that
 
01:11:18.790 --> 01:11:18.800 align:start position:0%
so my question is uh to know how do you
 
01:11:21.110 --> 01:11:21.120 align:start position:0%
start the fishing games here
 
01:11:23.270 --> 01:11:23.280 align:start position:0%
uh what are you talking about games
 
01:11:33.030 --> 01:11:33.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:34.790 --> 01:11:34.800 align:start position:0%
yeah okay now i i
 
01:11:37.350 --> 01:11:37.360 align:start position:0%
how do we get people to do sport hunting
 
01:11:39.189 --> 01:11:39.199 align:start position:0%
and fishing instead of commercial
 
01:11:42.070 --> 01:11:42.080 align:start position:0%
hunting and fishing yes okay thank you
 
01:11:46.550 --> 01:11:46.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:48.550 --> 01:11:48.560 align:start position:0%
our history
 
01:11:50.870 --> 01:11:50.880 align:start position:0%
fishing game is we just celebrated 150
 
01:11:53.590 --> 01:11:53.600 align:start position:0%
years in new hampshire so we our agency
 
01:11:56.070 --> 01:11:56.080 align:start position:0%
started over 150 years ago
 
01:11:56.080 --> 01:11:57.830 align:start position:0%
started over 150 years ago
um

01:11:57.830 --> 01:11:57.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:12:00.229 --> 01:12:00.239 align:start position:0%
what happened was is our
 
01:12:02.630 --> 01:12:02.640 align:start position:0%
uh resources you know
 
01:12:02.640 --> 01:12:04.070 align:start position:0%
uh resources you know
um

01:12:04.070 --> 01:12:04.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:12:06.149 --> 01:12:06.159 align:start position:0%
our rivers used to run black with salmon
 
01:12:07.830 --> 01:12:07.840 align:start position:0%
for example you know coming you know
 
01:12:09.830 --> 01:12:09.840 align:start position:0%
coming up the rivers to spawn
 
01:12:11.830 --> 01:12:11.840 align:start position:0%
and they were commercially harvested to
 
01:12:14.390 --> 01:12:14.400 align:start position:0%
the point where we've lost that resource
 
01:12:16.950 --> 01:12:16.960 align:start position:0%
as well as impacts to the habitat you
 
01:12:20.830 --> 01:12:20.840 align:start position:0%
know dams were built on these rivers
 
01:12:24.070 --> 01:12:24.080 align:start position:0%
um environmental impacts pollution to
 
01:12:25.990 --> 01:12:26.000 align:start position:0%
the rivers and whatnot like that so we
 
01:12:27.990 --> 01:12:28.000 align:start position:0%
lost our resources
 
01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:29.350 align:start position:0%
lost our resources
um

01:12:29.350 --> 01:12:29.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:12:32.390 --> 01:12:32.400 align:start position:0%
on like fisheries uh hunting you know
 
01:12:34.709 --> 01:12:34.719 align:start position:0%
the um
 
01:12:37.510 --> 01:12:37.520 align:start position:0%
partially do a combination of over
 
01:12:39.030 --> 01:12:39.040 align:start position:0%
hunting because you used to have market
 
01:12:40.709 --> 01:12:40.719 align:start position:0%
hunting we used to be able to go shoot
 
01:12:44.470 --> 01:12:44.480 align:start position:0%
ducks and sell ducks that you shot uh
 
01:12:44.480 --> 01:12:46.390 align:start position:0%
ducks and sell ducks that you shot uh
our

01:12:46.390 --> 01:12:46.400 align:start position:0%
our
 
01:12:48.630 --> 01:12:48.640 align:start position:0%
forest industry in the old days you
 
01:12:48.640 --> 01:12:49.350 align:start position:0%
forest industry in the old days you
would

01:12:49.350 --> 01:12:49.360 align:start position:0%
would
 
01:12:52.390 --> 01:12:52.400 align:start position:0%
have men go back into the woods and live
 
01:12:52.400 --> 01:12:53.030 align:start position:0%
have men go back into the woods and live
at

01:12:53.030 --> 01:12:53.040 align:start position:0%
at
 
01:12:54.630 --> 01:12:54.640 align:start position:0%
you know lumber camp and they would live
 
01:12:56.070 --> 01:12:56.080 align:start position:0%
up there all winter the trees were cut
 
01:12:58.950 --> 01:12:58.960 align:start position:0%
in the winter they were um you know sent
 
01:13:00.709 --> 01:13:00.719 align:start position:0%
to the rivers and swished down you know
 
01:13:03.590 --> 01:13:03.600 align:start position:0%
the sawmills further further
 
01:13:03.600 --> 01:13:04.950 align:start position:0%
the sawmills further further
um

01:13:04.950 --> 01:13:04.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:13:07.430 --> 01:13:07.440 align:start position:0%
and those camps were fed with venison
 
01:13:09.510 --> 01:13:09.520 align:start position:0%
fed with moose
 
01:13:11.750 --> 01:13:11.760 align:start position:0%
and and some of those species
 
01:13:13.830 --> 01:13:13.840 align:start position:0%
we had some issues with
 
01:13:16.870 --> 01:13:16.880 align:start position:0%
so by the time we got involved it was
 
01:13:19.110 --> 01:13:19.120 align:start position:0%
actually to save some of these species
 
01:13:20.709 --> 01:13:20.719 align:start position:0%
there were very few deer left in the
 
01:13:22.229 --> 01:13:22.239 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire when fish and
 
01:13:24.630 --> 01:13:24.640 align:start position:0%
game became involved in it
 
01:13:24.640 --> 01:13:27.510 align:start position:0%
game became involved in it
um

01:13:27.510 --> 01:13:27.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:27.520 --> 01:13:28.390 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:13:28.390 --> 01:13:28.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:13:30.550 --> 01:13:30.560 align:start position:0%
that was one of our early you know early
 
01:13:32.950 --> 01:13:32.960 align:start position:0%
steps where to shut down commercial
 
01:13:35.669 --> 01:13:35.679 align:start position:0%
the sale of wildlife other than as they
 
01:13:37.669 --> 01:13:37.679 align:start position:0%
say fur bears and and and some of the
 
01:13:37.679 --> 01:13:38.950 align:start position:0%
say fur bears and and and some of the
commercial

01:13:38.950 --> 01:13:38.960 align:start position:0%
commercial
 
01:13:41.030 --> 01:13:41.040 align:start position:0%
uh salt water fishing
 
01:13:41.040 --> 01:13:43.910 align:start position:0%
uh salt water fishing
um

01:13:43.910 --> 01:13:43.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:45.990 --> 01:13:46.000 align:start position:0%
i would dare say we probably waited too
 
01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:46.950 align:start position:0%
i would dare say we probably waited too
long

01:13:46.950 --> 01:13:46.960 align:start position:0%
long
 
01:13:47.990 --> 01:13:48.000 align:start position:0%
and and
 
01:13:49.750 --> 01:13:49.760 align:start position:0%
it's a combination of hunting pressure
 
01:13:51.510 --> 01:13:51.520 align:start position:0%
fishing pressure as well as habitat
 
01:13:53.350 --> 01:13:53.360 align:start position:0%
pressure environmental pressure on the
 
01:13:56.709 --> 01:13:56.719 align:start position:0%
habitat and and we waited too long to to
 
01:14:02.149 --> 01:14:02.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:04.310 --> 01:14:04.320 align:start position:0%
new hampshire you look around today and
 
01:14:06.390 --> 01:14:06.400 align:start position:0%
you see trees everywhere well if you
 
01:14:08.790 --> 01:14:08.800 align:start position:0%
were here in the 1820s you wouldn't see
 
01:14:10.870 --> 01:14:10.880 align:start position:0%
hardly a tree
 
01:14:12.870 --> 01:14:12.880 align:start position:0%
this was you know we used to grow all of
 
01:14:15.350 --> 01:14:15.360 align:start position:0%
our own food here and then as the west
 
01:14:18.310 --> 01:14:18.320 align:start position:0%
opened up you know people moved out west
 
01:14:20.149 --> 01:14:20.159 align:start position:0%
so those farms you know some of the
 
01:14:23.350 --> 01:14:23.360 align:start position:0%
farms were kept in production um sheep
 
01:14:26.070 --> 01:14:26.080 align:start position:0%
we had the amisk woolen mills excuse me
 
01:14:28.390 --> 01:14:28.400 align:start position:0%
down in manchester those are the largest
 
01:14:29.830 --> 01:14:29.840 align:start position:0%
at the time they were the largest woolen
 
01:14:31.430 --> 01:14:31.440 align:start position:0%
mills in the world
 
01:14:33.350 --> 01:14:33.360 align:start position:0%
so when you looked around new hampshire
 
01:14:34.870 --> 01:14:34.880 align:start position:0%
you used to see nothing but sheep they
 
01:14:37.590 --> 01:14:37.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:40.229 --> 01:14:40.239 align:start position:0%
and as time went on these markets
 
01:14:42.470 --> 01:14:42.480 align:start position:0%
changed and that land
 
01:14:45.189 --> 01:14:45.199 align:start position:0%
stopped being farmed and started growing
 
01:14:47.189 --> 01:14:47.199 align:start position:0%
back up and that's
 
01:14:49.110 --> 01:14:49.120 align:start position:0%
that was partially what happened to
 
01:14:51.110 --> 01:14:51.120 align:start position:0%
return some of our wildlife species that
 
01:14:53.669 --> 01:14:53.679 align:start position:0%
we that had been here back in the 1700s
 
01:14:56.470 --> 01:14:56.480 align:start position:0%
or the 1600s when folks first got here
 
01:14:59.110 --> 01:14:59.120 align:start position:0%
um and that's been you know that plus
 
01:15:01.510 --> 01:15:01.520 align:start position:0%
the work we do i think is has led to a
 
01:15:04.390 --> 01:15:04.400 align:start position:0%
you know a major change in in what what
 
01:15:05.750 --> 01:15:05.760 align:start position:0%
we now see
 
01:15:05.760 --> 01:15:07.270 align:start position:0%
we now see
um

01:15:07.270 --> 01:15:07.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:15:09.830 --> 01:15:09.840 align:start position:0%
i you know i grew up
 
01:15:11.910 --> 01:15:11.920 align:start position:0%
probably about 10 miles from here as a
 
01:15:11.920 --> 01:15:12.709 align:start position:0%
probably about 10 miles from here as a
kid

01:15:12.709 --> 01:15:12.719 align:start position:0%
kid
 
01:15:14.790 --> 01:15:14.800 align:start position:0%
we never saw a black bear in town oh you
 
01:15:15.990 --> 01:15:16.000 align:start position:0%
know my whole you know until i was in
 
01:15:17.750 --> 01:15:17.760 align:start position:0%
college never never saw a black bear in
 
01:15:17.760 --> 01:15:18.630 align:start position:0%
college never never saw a black bear in
town

01:15:18.630 --> 01:15:18.640 align:start position:0%
town
 
01:15:20.390 --> 01:15:20.400 align:start position:0%
uh now it's pretty regularly that they
 
01:15:22.149 --> 01:15:22.159 align:start position:0%
see black bears down here
 
01:15:24.229 --> 01:15:24.239 align:start position:0%
um same with moose we didn't use to see
 
01:15:26.310 --> 01:15:26.320 align:start position:0%
moose in southern new hampshire now
 
01:15:27.990 --> 01:15:28.000 align:start position:0%
well now it's starting to go the other
 
01:15:30.070 --> 01:15:30.080 align:start position:0%
way but uh you know now we have moose
 
01:15:32.390 --> 01:15:32.400 align:start position:0%
spread out across the state
 
01:15:33.510 --> 01:15:33.520 align:start position:0%
as far as
 
01:15:37.750 --> 01:15:37.760 align:start position:0%
how to make those changes i i go back to
 
01:15:39.910 --> 01:15:39.920 align:start position:0%
my father's stories that he told me when
 
01:15:41.590 --> 01:15:41.600 align:start position:0%
i was a child
 
01:15:43.590 --> 01:15:43.600 align:start position:0%
i think part of it is you've got to give
 
01:15:45.430 --> 01:15:45.440 align:start position:0%
these folks an opportunity to do
 
01:15:46.709 --> 01:15:46.719 align:start position:0%
something else
 
01:15:50.229 --> 01:15:50.239 align:start position:0%
um you know another economic pathway to
 
01:15:51.910 --> 01:15:51.920 align:start position:0%
their own personal success because at
 
01:15:53.350 --> 01:15:53.360 align:start position:0%
the end of the day they're they're just
 
01:15:54.790 --> 01:15:54.800 align:start position:0%
trying to feed their family and and
 
01:15:56.870 --> 01:15:56.880 align:start position:0%
they're doing it through harvesting wild
 
01:15:56.880 --> 01:15:57.910 align:start position:0%
they're doing it through harvesting wild
game

01:15:57.910 --> 01:15:57.920 align:start position:0%
game
 
01:16:00.709 --> 01:16:00.719 align:start position:0%
um so giving them opportunities in life
 
01:16:02.310 --> 01:16:02.320 align:start position:0%
becomes a crucial part of being
 
01:16:02.320 --> 01:16:03.510 align:start position:0%
becomes a crucial part of being
successful

01:16:03.510 --> 01:16:03.520 align:start position:0%
successful
 
01:16:07.510 --> 01:16:07.520 align:start position:0%
being fair with these folks
 
01:16:09.430 --> 01:16:09.440 align:start position:0%
i think sometimes
 
01:16:09.440 --> 01:16:12.229 align:start position:0%
i think sometimes
and

01:16:12.229 --> 01:16:12.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:14.870 --> 01:16:14.880 align:start position:0%
we concentrate on the goal
 
01:16:17.430 --> 01:16:17.440 align:start position:0%
and we can sometimes forget the impact
 
01:16:19.990 --> 01:16:20.000 align:start position:0%
that that goal has on people and i think
 
01:16:21.669 --> 01:16:21.679 align:start position:0%
you know you need to be fair with with
 
01:16:21.679 --> 01:16:22.630 align:start position:0%
you know you need to be fair with with
folks

01:16:22.630 --> 01:16:22.640 align:start position:0%
folks
 
01:16:24.630 --> 01:16:24.640 align:start position:0%
honest you need to bring them into the
 
01:16:24.640 --> 01:16:26.470 align:start position:0%
honest you need to bring them into the
solution

01:16:26.470 --> 01:16:26.480 align:start position:0%
solution
 
01:16:28.950 --> 01:16:28.960 align:start position:0%
give them a voice in how the solution
 
01:16:31.669 --> 01:16:31.679 align:start position:0%
will impact them
 
01:16:33.510 --> 01:16:33.520 align:start position:0%
right now we're going through some major
 
01:16:35.510 --> 01:16:35.520 align:start position:0%
changes on the seacoast with our lobster
 
01:16:38.070 --> 01:16:38.080 align:start position:0%
industry we're trying to protect
 
01:16:38.080 --> 01:16:39.350 align:start position:0%
industry we're trying to protect
whales

01:16:39.350 --> 01:16:39.360 align:start position:0%
whales
 
01:16:42.950 --> 01:16:42.960 align:start position:0%
right whales seem to have a hard time on
 
01:16:45.189 --> 01:16:45.199 align:start position:0%
navigating around
 
01:16:48.790 --> 01:16:48.800 align:start position:0%
lines in the water so as i assume
 
01:16:50.790 --> 01:16:50.800 align:start position:0%
lobster traps are sitting on the bottom
 
01:16:52.950 --> 01:16:52.960 align:start position:0%
of the ocean and they're you know we
 
01:16:55.110 --> 01:16:55.120 align:start position:0%
have like 10 or 20 of them tied together
 
01:16:56.709 --> 01:16:56.719 align:start position:0%
and then you have a line going up to a
 
01:16:59.830 --> 01:16:59.840 align:start position:0%
buoy on top at the surface and sometimes
 
01:17:02.310 --> 01:17:02.320 align:start position:0%
if a whale swims by they can get tangled
 
01:17:05.910 --> 01:17:05.920 align:start position:0%
in these lines and with the
 
01:17:05.920 --> 01:17:07.270 align:start position:0%
in these lines and with the
the

01:17:07.270 --> 01:17:07.280 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:17:10.070 --> 01:17:10.080 align:start position:0%
the way the right whale
 
01:17:12.310 --> 01:17:12.320 align:start position:0%
responds when he comes in contact with
 
01:17:14.470 --> 01:17:14.480 align:start position:0%
one of these lines makes them much more
 
01:17:17.750 --> 01:17:17.760 align:start position:0%
susceptible to getting entangled and and
 
01:17:18.870 --> 01:17:18.880 align:start position:0%
being hurt
 
01:17:20.790 --> 01:17:20.800 align:start position:0%
and they are an endangered species so
 
01:17:22.630 --> 01:17:22.640 align:start position:0%
we're we're right now going through a
 
01:17:25.270 --> 01:17:25.280 align:start position:0%
process of having breakaway lines so
 
01:17:27.189 --> 01:17:27.199 align:start position:0%
that there's a weak link in that line so
 
01:17:30.470 --> 01:17:30.480 align:start position:0%
if a whale gets tangled in the line um
 
01:17:32.390 --> 01:17:32.400 align:start position:0%
it'll break away and hopefully save the
 
01:17:34.790 --> 01:17:34.800 align:start position:0%
whale so these are new regulations
 
01:17:34.800 --> 01:17:35.669 align:start position:0%
whale so these are new regulations
um

01:17:35.669 --> 01:17:35.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:17:37.430 --> 01:17:37.440 align:start position:0%
our lobstermen are concerned about the
 
01:17:39.189 --> 01:17:39.199 align:start position:0%
cost they're concerned about you know
 
01:17:41.110 --> 01:17:41.120 align:start position:0%
having to recover traps after the line
 
01:17:42.630 --> 01:17:42.640 align:start position:0%
gets broken
 
01:17:42.640 --> 01:17:45.350 align:start position:0%
gets broken
um

01:17:45.350 --> 01:17:45.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:17:47.750 --> 01:17:47.760 align:start position:0%
a bunch of issues but as i say working
 
01:17:49.669 --> 01:17:49.679 align:start position:0%
with the lobstermen and trying to get
 
01:17:51.910 --> 01:17:51.920 align:start position:0%
buy-in becomes a very a very important
 
01:17:54.229 --> 01:17:54.239 align:start position:0%
part of that
 
01:17:56.470 --> 01:17:56.480 align:start position:0%
does that answer your question
 
01:17:58.790 --> 01:17:58.800 align:start position:0%
and then the other part of it is i think
 
01:18:02.310 --> 01:18:02.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:04.310 --> 01:18:04.320 align:start position:0%
let us go back to new hampshire at the
 
01:18:05.750 --> 01:18:05.760 align:start position:0%
turn of the century in you know the
 
01:18:07.990 --> 01:18:08.000 align:start position:0%
1890s 1880s
 
01:18:09.990 --> 01:18:10.000 align:start position:0%
um you know
 
01:18:12.310 --> 01:18:12.320 align:start position:0%
is getting tourists to come and hunt and
 
01:18:14.870 --> 01:18:14.880 align:start position:0%
fish and pay for those licenses and and
 
01:18:14.880 --> 01:18:16.950 align:start position:0%
fish and pay for those licenses and and
pay

01:18:16.950 --> 01:18:16.960 align:start position:0%
pay
 
01:18:19.750 --> 01:18:19.760 align:start position:0%
into the economy to create jobs for some
 
01:18:21.270 --> 01:18:21.280 align:start position:0%
of those folks so
 
01:18:21.280 --> 01:18:22.790 align:start position:0%
of those folks so
um

01:18:22.790 --> 01:18:22.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:18:24.790 --> 01:18:24.800 align:start position:0%
i come i live now i live at the northern
 
01:18:26.390 --> 01:18:26.400 align:start position:0%
end of the state and
 
01:18:28.470 --> 01:18:28.480 align:start position:0%
that's kind of where a lot of our
 
01:18:31.350 --> 01:18:31.360 align:start position:0%
our guides work out of so we have quite
 
01:18:32.790 --> 01:18:32.800 align:start position:0%
an economy
 
01:18:35.430 --> 01:18:35.440 align:start position:0%
up there uh during hunting season where
 
01:18:37.110 --> 01:18:37.120 align:start position:0%
people come and stay
 
01:18:39.350 --> 01:18:39.360 align:start position:0%
you have restaurants you have hotels you
 
01:18:42.550 --> 01:18:42.560 align:start position:0%
have guides that all make a living off
 
01:18:45.350 --> 01:18:45.360 align:start position:0%
of um we use the word sport but you know
 
01:18:46.709 --> 01:18:46.719 align:start position:0%
a tourist
 
01:18:48.709 --> 01:18:48.719 align:start position:0%
hunter or angler that comes up that
 
01:18:50.550 --> 01:18:50.560 align:start position:0%
wants to experience this
 
01:18:52.070 --> 01:18:52.080 align:start position:0%
one of the things
 
01:18:55.750 --> 01:18:55.760 align:start position:0%
we've seen that um you know i i grew up
 
01:18:57.590 --> 01:18:57.600 align:start position:0%
poor i grew up you know not a lot of
 
01:18:59.830 --> 01:18:59.840 align:start position:0%
money so it never really i didn't
 
01:19:01.430 --> 01:19:01.440 align:start position:0%
understand it until i had an opportunity
 
01:19:03.910 --> 01:19:03.920 align:start position:0%
to work with one of our fortune 500
 
01:19:06.149 --> 01:19:06.159 align:start position:0%
corporations here in the united states
 
01:19:08.630 --> 01:19:08.640 align:start position:0%
and you know you get these um um
 
01:19:10.870 --> 01:19:10.880 align:start position:0%
executives from these large companies
 
01:19:10.880 --> 01:19:11.910 align:start position:0%
executives from these large companies
and

01:19:11.910 --> 01:19:11.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:19:14.229 --> 01:19:14.239 align:start position:0%
they want to experience
 
01:19:16.550 --> 01:19:16.560 align:start position:0%
catching the big fish or or catching the
 
01:19:19.030 --> 01:19:19.040 align:start position:0%
big deer or or whatever
 
01:19:21.110 --> 01:19:21.120 align:start position:0%
and they have very limited time to do it
 
01:19:22.550 --> 01:19:22.560 align:start position:0%
which means they're willing to spend a
 
01:19:24.310 --> 01:19:24.320 align:start position:0%
lot of money for the right people to get
 
01:19:26.470 --> 01:19:26.480 align:start position:0%
them to where they want to go
 
01:19:26.480 --> 01:19:28.229 align:start position:0%
them to where they want to go
and

01:19:28.229 --> 01:19:28.239 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:19:29.830 --> 01:19:29.840 align:start position:0%
in our case here we deal with tourism
 
01:19:31.750 --> 01:19:31.760 align:start position:0%
from outside of new hampshire
 
01:19:33.350 --> 01:19:33.360 align:start position:0%
on your case you may need to deal with
 
01:19:34.870 --> 01:19:34.880 align:start position:0%
tourists outside of your country trying
 
01:19:36.630 --> 01:19:36.640 align:start position:0%
to attract folks into the country to to
 
01:19:40.070 --> 01:19:40.080 align:start position:0%
come and fish that kind of stuff
 
01:19:42.790 --> 01:19:42.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:45.030 --> 01:19:45.040 align:start position:0%
so one of the last i'll say just to tack
 
01:19:46.470 --> 01:19:46.480 align:start position:0%
on to that for the executive jacket one
 
01:19:49.030 --> 01:19:49.040 align:start position:0%
of the big things the agency does is
 
01:19:49.040 --> 01:19:50.550 align:start position:0%
of the big things the agency does is
education

01:19:50.550 --> 01:19:50.560 align:start position:0%
education
 
01:19:52.229 --> 01:19:52.239 align:start position:0%
working with
 
01:19:53.830 --> 01:19:53.840 align:start position:0%
all the different partners whether it's
 
01:19:55.830 --> 01:19:55.840 align:start position:0%
the general public for the sport fishing
 
01:19:58.470 --> 01:19:58.480 align:start position:0%
the inland fishing and working with them
 
01:19:59.990 --> 01:20:00.000 align:start position:0%
they provide
 
01:20:01.669 --> 01:20:01.679 align:start position:0%
hunter safety and hunter education
 
01:20:01.679 --> 01:20:03.270 align:start position:0%
hunter safety and hunter education
courses

01:20:03.270 --> 01:20:03.280 align:start position:0%
courses
 
01:20:04.630 --> 01:20:04.640 align:start position:0%
they work with the as you just heard
 
01:20:06.070 --> 01:20:06.080 align:start position:0%
with the fisheries dealing with the
 
01:20:08.709 --> 01:20:08.719 align:start position:0%
breakaway lines for them right
 
01:20:10.870 --> 01:20:10.880 align:start position:0%
so again it's the cooperative effort
 
01:20:13.750 --> 01:20:13.760 align:start position:0%
between the agency not using a hammer to
 
01:20:14.950 --> 01:20:14.960 align:start position:0%
force stuff
 
01:20:14.960 --> 01:20:15.750 align:start position:0%
force stuff
but

01:20:15.750 --> 01:20:15.760 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:20:17.750 --> 01:20:17.760 align:start position:0%
doing the soft cell and working with it
 
01:20:19.910 --> 01:20:19.920 align:start position:0%
to find a common ground that that works
 
01:20:19.920 --> 01:20:21.430 align:start position:0%
to find a common ground that that works
together

01:20:21.430 --> 01:20:21.440 align:start position:0%
together
 
01:20:23.350 --> 01:20:23.360 align:start position:0%
on a regular basis for the sports
 
01:20:25.510 --> 01:20:25.520 align:start position:0%
fishing in new hampshire we have like
 
01:20:26.950 --> 01:20:26.960 align:start position:0%
open days for fishing where you don't
 
01:20:28.550 --> 01:20:28.560 align:start position:0%
have to own a license you can just go
 
01:20:30.229 --> 01:20:30.239 align:start position:0%
and fish so to try to get people
 
01:20:32.310 --> 01:20:32.320 align:start position:0%
interested in doing inland sports
 
01:20:32.320 --> 01:20:33.350 align:start position:0%
interested in doing inland sports
fishing

01:20:33.350 --> 01:20:33.360 align:start position:0%
fishing
 
01:20:35.110 --> 01:20:35.120 align:start position:0%
without a cost right they can just go
 
01:20:36.470 --> 01:20:36.480 align:start position:0%
out on a saturday afternoon and go
 
01:20:38.390 --> 01:20:38.400 align:start position:0%
fishing no don't not have a license and
 
01:20:39.750 --> 01:20:39.760 align:start position:0%
if they enjoy it then they'll go buy a
 
01:20:41.270 --> 01:20:41.280 align:start position:0%
license and they'll do it again which
 
01:20:43.669 --> 01:20:43.679 align:start position:0%
helps promote the system helps promote
 
01:20:46.149 --> 01:20:46.159 align:start position:0%
the guides that the executive director
 
01:20:47.830 --> 01:20:47.840 align:start position:0%
was talking about that's a big piece in
 
01:20:49.910 --> 01:20:49.920 align:start position:0%
new hampshire uh because again we don't
 
01:20:51.750 --> 01:20:51.760 align:start position:0%
have commercial hunting you know for the
 
01:20:53.830 --> 01:20:53.840 align:start position:0%
most part we have corbyn park but i
 
01:20:56.310 --> 01:20:56.320 align:start position:0%
think other than that we have generally
 
01:20:58.870 --> 01:20:58.880 align:start position:0%
limited uh commercial hunting and we
 
01:21:01.430 --> 01:21:01.440 align:start position:0%
don't have any inland commercial fishing
 
01:21:03.750 --> 01:21:03.760 align:start position:0%
except for with guides and so that's a
 
01:21:05.430 --> 01:21:05.440 align:start position:0%
big aspect of what what the executive
 
01:21:07.189 --> 01:21:07.199 align:start position:0%
director was talking about so promoting
 
01:21:07.199 --> 01:21:07.990 align:start position:0%
director was talking about so promoting
those

01:21:07.990 --> 01:21:08.000 align:start position:0%
those
 
01:21:09.590 --> 01:21:09.600 align:start position:0%
tourism activities promoting those
 
01:21:11.990 --> 01:21:12.000 align:start position:0%
recreational activities help sustain
 
01:21:16.390 --> 01:21:16.400 align:start position:0%
they have a pretty large um hatchery
 
01:21:19.350 --> 01:21:19.360 align:start position:0%
program to stock our inland fisheries to
 
01:21:21.350 --> 01:21:21.360 align:start position:0%
stock our lakes and to stock our streams
 
01:21:23.590 --> 01:21:23.600 align:start position:0%
with fish so that whenever you go out to
 
01:21:25.189 --> 01:21:25.199 align:start position:0%
do recreational fishing there's actually
 
01:21:27.030 --> 01:21:27.040 align:start position:0%
a fish for you to catch
 
01:21:30.229 --> 01:21:30.239 align:start position:0%
to keep that to keep that happening so
 
01:21:32.070 --> 01:21:32.080 align:start position:0%
again i think education
 
01:21:33.910 --> 01:21:33.920 align:start position:0%
and sustainability programs that the
 
01:21:36.229 --> 01:21:36.239 align:start position:0%
agency's done has been phenomenal and
 
01:21:39.110 --> 01:21:39.120 align:start position:0%
helped new hampshire in keeping the our
 
01:21:41.110 --> 01:21:41.120 align:start position:0%
program i scott if i'm not mistaken last
 
01:21:43.430 --> 01:21:43.440 align:start position:0%
year was the largest year in record for
 
01:21:44.709 --> 01:21:44.719 align:start position:0%
revenues for the fish and game
 
01:21:44.719 --> 01:21:45.830 align:start position:0%
revenues for the fish and game
department

01:21:45.830 --> 01:21:45.840 align:start position:0%
department
 
01:21:45.840 --> 01:21:47.590 align:start position:0%
department
um

01:21:47.590 --> 01:21:47.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:21:50.629 --> 01:21:50.639 align:start position:0%
yep so again last year due to the advent
 
01:21:52.229 --> 01:21:52.239 align:start position:0%
of covet everybody wanted to be outside
 
01:21:54.470 --> 01:21:54.480 align:start position:0%
nobody wanted to be inside but fish and
 
01:21:57.350 --> 01:21:57.360 align:start position:0%
game was able to capitalize on that and
 
01:21:59.430 --> 01:21:59.440 align:start position:0%
we sold more fishing license we sold
 
01:22:01.590 --> 01:22:01.600 align:start position:0%
more hunting licenses things outdoor
 
01:22:04.149 --> 01:22:04.159 align:start position:0%
activities were highly promoted um
 
01:22:06.229 --> 01:22:06.239 align:start position:0%
because nobody wanted to be inside so it
 
01:22:07.990 --> 01:22:08.000 align:start position:0%
rate increased the revenue for the
 
01:22:10.310 --> 01:22:10.320 align:start position:0%
agency that agency is one of the few
 
01:22:11.750 --> 01:22:11.760 align:start position:0%
agencies in our state that's
 
01:22:14.390 --> 01:22:14.400 align:start position:0%
self-funding so all the revenue they
 
01:22:15.910 --> 01:22:15.920 align:start position:0%
make they keep and they use for their
 
01:22:17.990 --> 01:22:18.000 align:start position:0%
own agency um
 
01:22:21.350 --> 01:22:21.360 align:start position:0%
and so uh it's it's when we have places
 
01:22:23.110 --> 01:22:23.120 align:start position:0%
like this where we can increase revenue
 
01:22:25.350 --> 01:22:25.360 align:start position:0%
and be self-sustaining it helps a on the
 
01:22:27.750 --> 01:22:27.760 align:start position:0%
tax rate for our local citizens and and
 
01:22:30.310 --> 01:22:30.320 align:start position:0%
helps get people more people involved in
 
01:22:34.229 --> 01:22:34.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:34.239 --> 01:22:35.030 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

01:22:35.030 --> 01:22:35.040 align:start position:0%

01:22:56.310 --> 01:22:56.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:58.950 --> 01:22:58.960 align:start position:0%
well um i would like to know
 
01:23:00.709 --> 01:23:00.719 align:start position:0%
if it's possible
 
01:23:03.830 --> 01:23:03.840 align:start position:0%
to have depend on legislation
 
01:23:03.840 --> 01:23:04.830 align:start position:0%
to have depend on legislation
in

01:23:04.830 --> 01:23:04.840 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:23:07.590 --> 01:23:07.600 align:start position:0%
force the penalties
 
01:23:07.600 --> 01:23:11.189 align:start position:0%
force the penalties
legislation

01:23:11.189 --> 01:23:11.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:11.199 --> 01:23:15.189 align:start position:0%
 
legislation

01:23:15.189 --> 01:23:15.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:18.950 --> 01:23:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:18.960 --> 01:23:21.669 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

01:23:21.669 --> 01:23:21.679 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:23:24.550 --> 01:23:24.560 align:start position:0%
yes but i i i know i know that uh you
 
01:23:27.510 --> 01:23:27.520 align:start position:0%
have um uh different and several
 
01:23:30.229 --> 01:23:30.239 align:start position:0%
legislations i would like to have only
 
01:23:32.629 --> 01:23:32.639 align:start position:0%
the panel legislation
 
01:23:35.590 --> 01:23:35.600 align:start position:0%
that we can find translations that we
 
01:23:38.470 --> 01:23:38.480 align:start position:0%
can find the crisis
 
01:23:42.550 --> 01:23:42.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:43.590 --> 01:23:43.600 align:start position:0%
i think the two things you're looking
 
01:23:45.110 --> 01:23:45.120 align:start position:0%
for you're looking for some of the state
 
01:23:47.750 --> 01:23:47.760 align:start position:0%
regulatory aspect from the agency itself
 
01:23:49.270 --> 01:23:49.280 align:start position:0%
as well as maybe we can see about
 
01:23:50.870 --> 01:23:50.880 align:start position:0%
getting you guys copies of our state
 
01:23:52.629 --> 01:23:52.639 align:start position:0%
laws i'll see if i can get those two
 
01:23:57.110 --> 01:23:57.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:58.709 --> 01:23:58.719 align:start position:0%
so the major major will help us get the
 
01:24:00.550 --> 01:24:00.560 align:start position:0%
information i'll give it to a niece and
 
01:24:03.990 --> 01:24:04.000 align:start position:0%
she can get it out to you guys okay okay
 
01:24:05.750 --> 01:24:05.760 align:start position:0%
okay because uh
 
01:24:08.790 --> 01:24:08.800 align:start position:0%
in angola i'm from angola yes because in
 
01:24:08.800 --> 01:24:09.910 align:start position:0%
in angola i'm from angola yes because in
angola

01:24:09.910 --> 01:24:09.920 align:start position:0%
angola
 
01:24:13.350 --> 01:24:13.360 align:start position:0%
our legislations um
 
01:24:16.950 --> 01:24:16.960 align:start position:0%
some conducts we consider that is crime
 
01:24:19.350 --> 01:24:19.360 align:start position:0%
and another another conduct we consider
 
01:24:21.030 --> 01:24:21.040 align:start position:0%
that is transgressions
 
01:24:22.870 --> 01:24:22.880 align:start position:0%
you know transgression
 
01:24:25.430 --> 01:24:25.440 align:start position:0%
on which we apply
 
01:24:25.440 --> 01:24:26.709 align:start position:0%
on which we apply
fines

01:24:26.709 --> 01:24:26.719 align:start position:0%
fines
 
01:24:29.110 --> 01:24:29.120 align:start position:0%
and on crime is that
 
01:24:31.590 --> 01:24:31.600 align:start position:0%
we can arrest
 
01:24:33.430 --> 01:24:33.440 align:start position:0%
arrest the proprietors
 
01:24:36.870 --> 01:24:36.880 align:start position:0%
and in the codes
 
01:24:36.880 --> 01:24:39.669 align:start position:0%
and in the codes
judges

01:24:39.669 --> 01:24:39.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:42.149 --> 01:24:42.159 align:start position:0%
in occurrence of the law
 
01:24:42.159 --> 01:24:43.110 align:start position:0%
in occurrence of the law
yes

01:24:43.110 --> 01:24:43.120 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:24:45.270 --> 01:24:45.280 align:start position:0%
and i would like to study it you have to
 
01:24:47.590 --> 01:24:47.600 align:start position:0%
make a difference to compare
 
01:24:52.950 --> 01:24:52.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:55.189 --> 01:24:55.199 align:start position:0%
most of ours are violations which is a
 
01:24:56.790 --> 01:24:56.800 align:start position:0%
fine um
 
01:24:57.910 --> 01:24:57.920 align:start position:0%
some of the more serious ones are
 
01:24:59.430 --> 01:24:59.440 align:start position:0%
misdemeanors and there's very few
 
01:24:59.440 --> 01:25:00.470 align:start position:0%
misdemeanors and there's very few
felonies

01:25:00.470 --> 01:25:00.480 align:start position:0%
felonies
 
01:25:01.669 --> 01:25:01.679 align:start position:0%
but i think
 
01:25:01.679 --> 01:25:02.550 align:start position:0%
but i think
uh

01:25:02.550 --> 01:25:02.560 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:25:05.750 --> 01:25:05.760 align:start position:0%
and i'm speculating here in angola if if
 
01:25:07.750 --> 01:25:07.760 align:start position:0%
if you have a large game species that's
 
01:25:09.910 --> 01:25:09.920 align:start position:0%
endangered that's probably a very
 
01:25:13.189 --> 01:25:13.199 align:start position:0%
serious offense we don't have a um well
 
01:25:14.709 --> 01:25:14.719 align:start position:0%
nobody can hunt or take an endangered
 
01:25:16.870 --> 01:25:16.880 align:start position:0%
species and we don't have a lot
 
01:25:16.880 --> 01:25:17.669 align:start position:0%
species and we don't have a lot
so

01:25:17.669 --> 01:25:17.679 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:25:19.590 --> 01:25:19.600 align:start position:0%
most of our violations occur with game
 
01:25:21.750 --> 01:25:21.760 align:start position:0%
species so you may be able to shoot a
 
01:25:24.310 --> 01:25:24.320 align:start position:0%
deer but you can't do it in may and that
 
01:25:26.870 --> 01:25:26.880 align:start position:0%
would be you know a misdemeanor which
 
01:25:29.430 --> 01:25:29.440 align:start position:0%
they could arrest but uh we don't
 
01:25:31.350 --> 01:25:31.360 align:start position:0%
typically see the very large fines and
 
01:25:33.830 --> 01:25:33.840 align:start position:0%
the very large penalties unless it's a
 
01:25:36.790 --> 01:25:36.800 align:start position:0%
repeat offender over and over again um
 
01:25:39.510 --> 01:25:39.520 align:start position:0%
so there are a lot of differences but um
 
01:25:41.030 --> 01:25:41.040 align:start position:0%
i could try to get get you some
 
01:25:44.550 --> 01:25:44.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:47.430 --> 01:25:47.440 align:start position:0%
probably the most serious
 
01:25:49.350 --> 01:25:49.360 align:start position:0%
infraction or i won't say infraction but
 
01:25:51.910 --> 01:25:51.920 align:start position:0%
penalty is taking away the license for a
 
01:25:53.590 --> 01:25:53.600 align:start position:0%
period of time so a lot of times you
 
01:25:56.149 --> 01:25:56.159 align:start position:0%
will re if it's a multiple offender or a
 
01:25:57.669 --> 01:25:57.679 align:start position:0%
serious offense
 
01:25:59.590 --> 01:25:59.600 align:start position:0%
will take away a person's right to have
 
01:26:01.510 --> 01:26:01.520 align:start position:0%
a hunting license or a phishing license
 
01:26:04.070 --> 01:26:04.080 align:start position:0%
for a period of time a year five years
 
01:26:05.910 --> 01:26:05.920 align:start position:0%
to say you know we've given you three
 
01:26:07.350 --> 01:26:07.360 align:start position:0%
chances and you keep doing the same
 
01:26:08.950 --> 01:26:08.960 align:start position:0%
violation so now
 
01:26:10.870 --> 01:26:10.880 align:start position:0%
it's just illegal you can't have a
 
01:26:13.030 --> 01:26:13.040 align:start position:0%
license ever or for a period of time i
 
01:26:14.470 --> 01:26:14.480 align:start position:0%
should say
 
01:26:15.990 --> 01:26:16.000 align:start position:0%
and that's one of the most the biggest
 
01:26:18.229 --> 01:26:18.239 align:start position:0%
deterrents with all the fish and game is
 
01:26:20.790 --> 01:26:20.800 align:start position:0%
if you lose your ability to do it and
 
01:26:22.550 --> 01:26:22.560 align:start position:0%
with the commercial phishing side
 
01:26:24.470 --> 01:26:24.480 align:start position:0%
if you have so many violations and you
 
01:26:26.709 --> 01:26:26.719 align:start position:0%
lose your commercial license you lose
 
01:26:29.030 --> 01:26:29.040 align:start position:0%
your livelihood so it's something they
 
01:26:34.830 --> 01:26:34.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:38.149 --> 01:26:38.159 align:start position:0%
okay uh thank you sir uh
 
01:26:40.870 --> 01:26:40.880 align:start position:0%
it's finished uh
 
01:26:43.189 --> 01:26:43.199 align:start position:0%
can we have time it's done it's done
 
01:26:43.199 --> 01:26:44.470 align:start position:0%
can we have time it's done it's done
yeah

01:26:44.470 --> 01:26:44.480 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:26:46.950 --> 01:26:46.960 align:start position:0%
we are running out of time so
 
01:26:50.310 --> 01:26:50.320 align:start position:0%
if you have maybe something one is one
 
01:26:53.830 --> 01:26:53.840 align:start position:0%
question or a general uh comment for for
 
01:26:55.990 --> 01:26:56.000 align:start position:0%
us it's nice and then we can take a
 
01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:57.830 align:start position:0%
