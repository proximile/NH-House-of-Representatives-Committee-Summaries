i'm here to introduce house bill 1007
 
00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 align:start position:0%
relative to qualifications for office
 
00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:05.519 align:start position:0%
since the ratification of the 14th
 
00:03:06.869 --> 00:03:06.879 align:start position:0%
amendment to the united states
 
00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:09.680 align:start position:0%
constitution in 1867
 
00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:11.680 align:start position:0%
it has been established law that people
 
00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 align:start position:0%
who engage in insurrection or rebellion
 
00:03:16.149 --> 00:03:16.159 align:start position:0%
are ineligible to serve in public office
 
00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:18.640 align:start position:0%
anywhere in the united states unless
 
00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:22.080 align:start position:0%
excused by a super majority of congress
 
00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:24.400 align:start position:0%
whether or not house bill 1007
 
00:03:26.229 --> 00:03:26.239 align:start position:0%
eventually becomes law
 
00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:28.480 align:start position:0%
this prohibition will continue to be
 
00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:30.239 align:start position:0%
established law
 
00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400 align:start position:0%
for your information i just emailed the
 
00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:35.000 align:start position:0%
committee a document from
 
00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:37.280 align:start position:0%
congratulate research services on the
 
00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:38.720 align:start position:0%
14th amendment
 
00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 align:start position:0%
and i particularly call your attention
 
00:03:44.229 --> 00:03:44.239 align:start position:0%
to the discussion on definitions
 
00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:47.120 align:start position:0%
so what does house bill 1007 do and what
 
00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680 align:start position:0%
problem does it solve
 
00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 align:start position:0%
under existing law the general court has
 
00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680 align:start position:0%
no authority to declare an office vacant
 
00:03:58.149 --> 00:03:58.159 align:start position:0%
and call for a special election if an
 
00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:00.239 align:start position:0%
individual is elected to office who is
 
00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:03.680 align:start position:0%
disqualified by the 14th amendment
 
00:04:06.789 --> 00:04:06.799 align:start position:0%
house bill 1007 simply adds this to the
 
00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:09.040 align:start position:0%
list of reasons we can declare an office
 
00:04:12.149 --> 00:04:12.159 align:start position:0%
vacant and call a special election
 
00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:14.640 align:start position:0%
without house bill 1007
 
00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:16.720 align:start position:0%
it isn't entirely possible certain
 
00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:19.359 align:start position:0%
citizens would be unrepresented for an
 
00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:21.600 align:start position:0%
entire legislative session if an
 
00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:25.919 align:start position:0%
unqualified person were elected
 
00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:28.080 align:start position:0%
are the definitions in section 2 of this
 
00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:30.240 align:start position:0%
bill appropriate
 
00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:31.720 align:start position:0%
the 14th amendment and its
 
00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:34.000 align:start position:0%
disqualification clause were adopted to
 
00:04:37.189 --> 00:04:37.199 align:start position:0%
disqualify confederate politicians from
 
00:04:39.189 --> 00:04:39.199 align:start position:0%
holding office
 
00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:41.280 align:start position:0%
any office
 
00:04:45.189 --> 00:04:45.199 align:start position:0%
on december 20th 1860 the south carolina
 
00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:47.840 align:start position:0%
convention unanimously adopted an
 
00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:48.950 align:start position:0%
convention unanimously adopted an
ordinance

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:48.960 align:start position:0%
ordinance
 
00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:51.440 align:start position:0%
peacefully separating itself
 
00:04:53.749 --> 00:04:53.759 align:start position:0%
from the union
 
00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:56.400 align:start position:0%
i believe the definitions as drafted
 
00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:57.510 align:start position:0%
i believe the definitions as drafted
actually

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:57.520 align:start position:0%
actually
 
00:04:59.510 --> 00:04:59.520 align:start position:0%
accurately reflect the original intent
 
00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:01.280 align:start position:0%
of the 14th amendment
 
00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:05.520 align:start position:0%
to disqualify those politicians
 
00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:06.680 align:start position:0%
i would like to clear up some
 
00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:09.120 align:start position:0%
misunderstandings specifically some
 
00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:12.400 align:start position:0%
things that this bill does not do
 
00:05:15.749 --> 00:05:15.759 align:start position:0%
house bill 1007 does not make secession
 
00:05:15.759 --> 00:05:17.270 align:start position:0%
house bill 1007 does not make secession
illegal

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:17.280 align:start position:0%
illegal
 
00:05:20.469 --> 00:05:20.479 align:start position:0%
that is already established law
 
00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:24.240 align:start position:0%
on january 16 1833 president jackson
 
00:05:25.749 --> 00:05:25.759 align:start position:0%
advised congress
 
00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:27.600 align:start position:0%
the right of the people of a single
 
00:05:29.749 --> 00:05:29.759 align:start position:0%
state to absolve themselves at will and
 
00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:32.240 align:start position:0%
without the consent of the other states
 
00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:34.080 align:start position:0%
from their most solemn obligations and
 
00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:35.840 align:start position:0%
hazard the liberties and happiness of
 
00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:36.550 align:start position:0%
hazard the liberties and happiness of
them

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:36.560 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:41.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:43.280 align:start position:0%
president buchanan repeated and
 
00:05:46.469 --> 00:05:46.479 align:start position:0%
elaborate on that statement in his 1860
 
00:05:49.189 --> 00:05:49.199 align:start position:0%
state of the union address
 
00:05:51.189 --> 00:05:51.199 align:start position:0%
and if there was any doubt approximately
 
00:05:53.909 --> 00:05:53.919 align:start position:0%
700 000 soldiers and an unknown number
 
00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:56.560 align:start position:0%
of civilians died in our civil war
 
00:05:58.629 --> 00:05:58.639 align:start position:0%
establishing that the united states was
 
00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:01.280 align:start position:0%
intended to be perpetual and that no
 
00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:04.240 align:start position:0%
state has the right to secede
 
00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:06.560 align:start position:0%
the united states supreme court was late
 
00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:10.160 align:start position:0%
to the party but the 1869 decision texas
 
00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:11.440 align:start position:0%
first fight
 
00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:15.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:18.240 align:start position:0%
house bill 1007 would not prohibit
 
00:06:19.909 --> 00:06:19.919 align:start position:0%
certain individuals from serving in
 
00:06:22.629 --> 00:06:22.639 align:start position:0%
public office because they are already
 
00:06:24.469 --> 00:06:24.479 align:start position:0%
so prohibited
 
00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:26.720 align:start position:0%
the disqualification clause of the 14th
 
00:06:29.189 --> 00:06:29.199 align:start position:0%
amendment will remain in effect whether
 
00:06:33.029 --> 00:06:33.039 align:start position:0%
or not house bill 1007 becomes law
 
00:06:35.029 --> 00:06:35.039 align:start position:0%
again this bill simply allows us to
 
00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:37.680 align:start position:0%
declare a seat vacant
 
00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:40.560 align:start position:0%
neither does house bill 1007 confer for
 
00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:42.560 align:start position:0%
upon the house or senate the ability to
 
00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:46.400 align:start position:0%
kick certain individuals out of office
 
00:06:49.029 --> 00:06:49.039 align:start position:0%
part two article 14 and article 29 of
 
00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:50.880 align:start position:0%
our state constitution clearly
 
00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:52.800 align:start position:0%
established that our house and senate is
 
00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:54.000 align:start position:0%
the final authority on the
 
00:06:57.029 --> 00:06:57.039 align:start position:0%
qualifications of their members
 
00:06:58.950 --> 00:06:58.960 align:start position:0%
the house and the senate already have
 
00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:01.440 align:start position:0%
constitutional authority to disqualify
 
00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:04.080 align:start position:0%
members at any time
 
00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:06.000 align:start position:0%
that will continue to be the case
 
00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:08.400 align:start position:0%
whether or not house bill 1007
 
00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:11.280 align:start position:0%
eventually becomes law
 
00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:14.000 align:start position:0%
without house bill 1007 a legislative
 
00:07:15.589 --> 00:07:15.599 align:start position:0%
seat would remain vacant following
 
00:07:18.309 --> 00:07:18.319 align:start position:0%
disqualification by the 14th amendment
 
00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:20.880 align:start position:0%
leaving citizens unrepresented
 
00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:22.880 align:start position:0%
i do believe all of our citizens are
 
00:07:25.189 --> 00:07:25.199 align:start position:0%
entitled to representation and that is
 
00:07:27.029 --> 00:07:27.039 align:start position:0%
why i ask you recommend this bill ought
 
00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:29.120 align:start position:0%
to pass thank you and i'll be happy to
 
00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:30.400 align:start position:0%
take questions
 
00:07:34.309 --> 00:07:34.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:36.629 --> 00:07:36.639 align:start position:0%
yes we have one question from
 
00:07:37.749 --> 00:07:37.759 align:start position:0%
our clerk
 
00:07:39.189 --> 00:07:39.199 align:start position:0%
i'm just wondering if you were going to
 
00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:41.520 align:start position:0%

00:07:43.270 --> 00:07:43.280 align:start position:0%

00:07:49.350 --> 00:07:49.360 align:start position:0%
further questions representative simon

00:07:52.790 --> 00:07:52.800 align:start position:0%
taking my question um in the last
 
00:07:56.070 --> 00:07:56.080 align:start position:0%
paragraph lines 21 through 24 you say
 
00:07:57.510 --> 00:07:57.520 align:start position:0%
for this for the purposes of this
 
00:07:59.270 --> 00:07:59.280 align:start position:0%
subparagraph insurrectional rebellion
 
00:08:00.629 --> 00:08:00.639 align:start position:0%
shall include any action intended to
 
00:08:02.070 --> 00:08:02.080 align:start position:0%
separate new hampshire from the united
 
00:08:04.629 --> 00:08:04.639 align:start position:0%
states and aid or comfort shall be uh
 
00:08:06.230 --> 00:08:06.240 align:start position:0%
shall include any action facilitating
 
00:08:07.749 --> 00:08:07.759 align:start position:0%
such intent
 
00:08:08.950 --> 00:08:08.960 align:start position:0%
um you made the statement that
 
00:08:10.950 --> 00:08:10.960 align:start position:0%
regardless of whether or not this passes
 
00:08:13.670 --> 00:08:13.680 align:start position:0%
into law article 14 section 3 of the us
 
00:08:16.790 --> 00:08:16.800 align:start position:0%
constitution already makes it illegal um
 
00:08:18.309 --> 00:08:18.319 align:start position:0%
to hold office if you've been part of an
 
00:08:20.710 --> 00:08:20.720 align:start position:0%
interaction or rebellion does article 14
 
00:08:21.749 --> 00:08:21.759 align:start position:0%
section 3 of the united states
 
00:08:25.430 --> 00:08:25.440 align:start position:0%
constitution include that language
 
00:08:27.350 --> 00:08:27.360 align:start position:0%
uh to the answer that question i would
 
00:08:29.110 --> 00:08:29.120 align:start position:0%
call your attention to the document i
 
00:08:30.710 --> 00:08:30.720 align:start position:0%
sent you from congressional research
 
00:08:32.149 --> 00:08:32.159 align:start position:0%
services and the discussion of
 
00:08:36.949 --> 00:08:36.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:39.670 --> 00:08:39.680 align:start position:0%
but the short answer is yes i believe
 
00:08:41.190 --> 00:08:41.200 align:start position:0%
the original intent of the 14th
 
00:08:43.829 --> 00:08:43.839 align:start position:0%
amendment was to disqualify confederate
 
00:08:46.470 --> 00:08:46.480 align:start position:0%
politicians from office whether or not
 
00:08:48.710 --> 00:08:48.720 align:start position:0%
they actually engaged in in physical
 
00:08:51.509 --> 00:08:51.519 align:start position:0%
violence as part of the army or not
 
00:08:51.519 --> 00:08:52.829 align:start position:0%
violence as part of the army or not
quick

00:08:52.829 --> 00:08:52.839 align:start position:0%
quick
 
00:08:54.949 --> 00:08:54.959 align:start position:0%
follow-up so
 
00:08:57.430 --> 00:08:57.440 align:start position:0%
assuming that it it doesn't just for a
 
00:08:59.110 --> 00:08:59.120 align:start position:0%
moment i understand you you say that you
 
00:09:00.710 --> 00:09:00.720 align:start position:0%
believe the intent of it is to
 
00:09:02.710 --> 00:09:02.720 align:start position:0%
communicate that but to say say for
 
00:09:04.389 --> 00:09:04.399 align:start position:0%
example that it doesn't include this
 
00:09:06.389 --> 00:09:06.399 align:start position:0%
language specifically
 
00:09:06.399 --> 00:09:07.269 align:start position:0%
language specifically
then

00:09:07.269 --> 00:09:07.279 align:start position:0%
then
 
00:09:09.990 --> 00:09:10.000 align:start position:0%
we would be disqualifying somebody under
 
00:09:11.430 --> 00:09:11.440 align:start position:0%
this law
 
00:09:14.310 --> 00:09:14.320 align:start position:0%
that isn't disqualified under article 14
 
00:09:16.630 --> 00:09:16.640 align:start position:0%
section 3 of the us constitution
 
00:09:18.870 --> 00:09:18.880 align:start position:0%
if we pass this and this language isn't
 
00:09:21.990 --> 00:09:22.000 align:start position:0%
specifically made in in article 14. well
 
00:09:23.990 --> 00:09:24.000 align:start position:0%
since i think your assumption is wrong i
 
00:09:26.389 --> 00:09:26.399 align:start position:0%
i think the question doesn't pertain
 
00:09:30.550 --> 00:09:30.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:33.590 --> 00:09:33.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:34.949 --> 00:09:34.959 align:start position:0%
i have one
 
00:09:34.959 --> 00:09:36.790 align:start position:0%
i have one
um

00:09:36.790 --> 00:09:36.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:37.750 align:start position:0%
um
why

00:09:37.750 --> 00:09:37.760 align:start position:0%
why
 
00:09:41.190 --> 00:09:41.200 align:start position:0%
this fashion and not a cacr
 
00:09:43.190 --> 00:09:43.200 align:start position:0%
i don't believe we need to amend our
 
00:09:45.829 --> 00:09:45.839 align:start position:0%
constitution in order to
 
00:09:47.509 --> 00:09:47.519 align:start position:0%
implement provision of the united states
 
00:09:47.519 --> 00:09:49.670 align:start position:0%
implement provision of the united states
constitution

00:09:49.670 --> 00:09:49.680 align:start position:0%
constitution
 
00:09:51.430 --> 00:09:51.440 align:start position:0%
i thank you for your
 
00:09:53.190 --> 00:09:53.200 align:start position:0%
your answer um
 
00:09:56.949 --> 00:09:56.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:58.949 --> 00:09:58.959 align:start position:0%
in in layman's terms
 
00:09:58.959 --> 00:09:59.990 align:start position:0%
in in layman's terms
would

00:09:59.990 --> 00:10:00.000 align:start position:0%
would
 
00:10:01.590 --> 00:10:01.600 align:start position:0%
your definition
 
00:10:03.509 --> 00:10:03.519 align:start position:0%
shown here
 
00:10:06.069 --> 00:10:06.079 align:start position:0%
be violated if
 
00:10:08.870 --> 00:10:08.880 align:start position:0%
a representative were to submit
 
00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:10.389 align:start position:0%
a representative were to submit
legislation

00:10:10.389 --> 00:10:10.399 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:10:10.399 --> 00:10:11.190 align:start position:0%
legislation
or

00:10:11.190 --> 00:10:11.200 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:10:14.069 --> 00:10:14.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:15.829 --> 00:10:15.839 align:start position:0%
in violation
 
00:10:18.870 --> 00:10:18.880 align:start position:0%
if the if the legislation were passed
 
00:10:21.269 --> 00:10:21.279 align:start position:0%
where is the defining line
 
00:10:23.509 --> 00:10:23.519 align:start position:0%
the defining line is the house would
 
00:10:25.590 --> 00:10:25.600 align:start position:0%
have to vote as to whether someone had
 
00:10:28.310 --> 00:10:28.320 align:start position:0%
violated the 14th amendment and that is
 
00:10:30.310 --> 00:10:30.320 align:start position:0%
well beyond my personal decision-making
 
00:10:32.949 --> 00:10:32.959 align:start position:0%
to make
 
00:10:35.110 --> 00:10:35.120 align:start position:0%
thank you so um
 
00:10:36.949 --> 00:10:36.959 align:start position:0%
so you're not saying
 
00:10:36.959 --> 00:10:37.829 align:start position:0%
so you're not saying
that

00:10:37.829 --> 00:10:37.839 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:10:40.470 --> 00:10:40.480 align:start position:0%
merely the act of discussing
 
00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:41.829 align:start position:0%
merely the act of discussing
or

00:10:41.829 --> 00:10:41.839 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:10:43.910 --> 00:10:43.920 align:start position:0%
submitting legislation
 
00:10:46.870 --> 00:10:46.880 align:start position:0%
would be the disqualifying factor
 
00:10:49.829 --> 00:10:49.839 align:start position:0%
uh mr chairman if i wanted to submit a
 
00:10:51.829 --> 00:10:51.839 align:start position:0%

00:10:55.509 --> 00:10:55.519 align:start position:0%
activities from office i could have
 
00:10:57.190 --> 00:10:57.200 align:start position:0%

00:10:59.350 --> 00:10:59.360 align:start position:0%
effect and i did not

any government entity to take the
 
00:32:02.950 --> 00:32:02.960 align:start position:0%
people's money and use it to lobby their

00:32:06.789 --> 00:32:06.799 align:start position:0%
let me be clear
 
00:32:09.430 --> 00:32:09.440 align:start position:0%
when we talk about government funds
 
00:32:11.350 --> 00:32:11.360 align:start position:0%

estimate that public school
 
00:33:32.630 --> 00:33:32.640 align:start position:0%
entity lobbying
 
00:33:35.110 --> 00:33:35.120 align:start position:0%
reached 102 million dollars in the
 
00:33:35.120 --> 00:33:36.870 align:start position:0%
reached 102 million dollars in the
country

00:33:36.870 --> 00:33:36.880 align:start position:0%
country
 
00:33:39.430 --> 00:33:39.440 align:start position:0%
it has been argued that this legislation
 
00:33:42.230 --> 00:33:42.240 align:start position:0%
would prohibit elected officials or
 
00:33:44.710 --> 00:33:44.720 align:start position:0%
employees from counties or towns or
 
00:33:44.720 --> 00:33:46.070 align:start position:0%
employees from counties or towns or
schools

00:33:46.070 --> 00:33:46.080 align:start position:0%
schools
 
00:33:48.789 --> 00:33:48.799 align:start position:0%
being prevented from testifying or even
 
00:33:52.389 --> 00:33:52.399 align:start position:0%
discussing issues with legislators
 
00:33:54.549 --> 00:33:54.559 align:start position:0%
that is incorrect
 
00:33:56.310 --> 00:33:56.320 align:start position:0%
none of these people would be considered
 
00:33:59.029 --> 00:33:59.039 align:start position:0%
lobbyists under our statutes
 
00:34:01.110 --> 00:34:01.120 align:start position:0%
and the definitions in statute in
 
00:34:03.909 --> 00:34:03.919 align:start position:0%
chapter 15 currently
 
00:34:06.070 --> 00:34:06.080 align:start position:0%
none of them would be required to
 
00:34:08.950 --> 00:34:08.960 align:start position:0%
register as lobbyists and therefore this
 
00:34:13.109 --> 00:34:13.119 align:start position:0%
legislation would not apply to them
 
00:34:16.550 --> 00:34:16.560 align:start position:0%
let me point however out however that
 
00:34:18.710 --> 00:34:18.720 align:start position:0%
just as currently stated in statute
 
00:34:21.829 --> 00:34:21.839 align:start position:0%
regarding state county municipal school
 
00:34:24.230 --> 00:34:24.240 align:start position:0%
district fund recipients
 
00:34:25.909 --> 00:34:25.919 align:start position:0%
could segregate
 
00:34:28.790 --> 00:34:28.800 align:start position:0%
government funds from the taxpayers and
 
00:34:30.869 --> 00:34:30.879 align:start position:0%
use other funds
 
00:34:32.829 --> 00:34:32.839 align:start position:0%
for any of these lobbying
 
00:34:36.230 --> 00:34:36.240 align:start position:0%
activities so the issue is not a
 
00:34:38.629 --> 00:34:38.639 align:start position:0%
prohibition of lobbying
 
00:34:42.950 --> 00:34:42.960 align:start position:0%
just the prohibition of the use of
 
00:34:45.829 --> 00:34:45.839 align:start position:0%
state county municipal school district
 
00:34:47.990 --> 00:34:48.000 align:start position:0%
funds funds that have come from our
 
00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:49.669 align:start position:0%
funds funds that have come from our
constituents

00:34:49.669 --> 00:34:49.679 align:start position:0%
constituents
 
00:34:51.270 --> 00:34:51.280 align:start position:0%
the taxpayers
 
00:34:53.430 --> 00:34:53.440 align:start position:0%
those funds to be used
 
00:34:55.190 --> 00:34:55.200 align:start position:0%
for lobbying
 
00:34:57.190 --> 00:34:57.200 align:start position:0%

probably in districts that i'm not as
 
00:35:38.470 --> 00:35:38.480 align:start position:0%
familiar with but taxpayer funds are
 
00:35:40.790 --> 00:35:40.800 align:start position:0%
being used to pay
 
00:35:42.950 --> 00:35:42.960 align:start position:0%
groups that lobby
 
00:35:45.030 --> 00:35:45.040 align:start position:0%

um thank you for coming in today the
 
00:36:08.069 --> 00:36:08.079 align:start position:0%
question i have is when we have school
 
00:36:09.589 --> 00:36:09.599 align:start position:0%
districts village districts
 
00:36:09.599 --> 00:36:11.190 align:start position:0%
districts village districts
municipalities

00:36:11.190 --> 00:36:11.200 align:start position:0%
municipalities
 
00:36:13.430 --> 00:36:13.440 align:start position:0%
paying salaries
 
00:36:17.430 --> 00:36:17.440 align:start position:0%
to individuals such as
 
00:36:19.910 --> 00:36:19.920 align:start position:0%
teachers firefighters people that are
 
00:36:21.670 --> 00:36:21.680 align:start position:0%
members of unions
 
00:36:24.470 --> 00:36:24.480 align:start position:0%
and they pay union dues
 
00:36:26.470 --> 00:36:26.480 align:start position:0%
how do we separate
 
00:36:29.109 --> 00:36:29.119 align:start position:0%
the salary that is being paid to the
 
00:36:32.470 --> 00:36:32.480 align:start position:0%
teachers and the firefighters and say
 
00:36:34.550 --> 00:36:34.560 align:start position:0%
that money came from counties towns
 
00:36:37.270 --> 00:36:37.280 align:start position:0%
municipalities so that
 
00:36:40.150 --> 00:36:40.160 align:start position:0%
teachers and firefighters are unable to
 
00:36:42.390 --> 00:36:42.400 align:start position:0%
support a candidate that they would like
 
00:36:47.030 --> 00:36:47.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:48.230 --> 00:36:48.240 align:start position:0%
i think
 
00:36:51.030 --> 00:36:51.040 align:start position:0%
the focus of what's in statute
 
00:36:51.040 --> 00:36:53.349 align:start position:0%
the focus of what's in statute
now

00:36:53.349 --> 00:36:53.359 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:36:54.950 --> 00:36:54.960 align:start position:0%
is centered on
 
00:36:56.950 --> 00:36:56.960 align:start position:0%
lobbying and
 
00:36:56.960 --> 00:36:58.150 align:start position:0%
lobbying and
influencing

00:36:58.150 --> 00:36:58.160 align:start position:0%
influencing
 
00:36:58.160 --> 00:36:59.990 align:start position:0%
influencing
state

00:36:59.990 --> 00:37:00.000 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:37:02.950 --> 00:37:02.960 align:start position:0%
or local actions
 
00:37:06.150 --> 00:37:06.160 align:start position:0%
in terms of political activity
 
00:37:06.160 --> 00:37:06.530 align:start position:0%
in terms of political activity
um

00:37:06.530 --> 00:37:06.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:06.540 --> 00:37:07.750 align:start position:0%
um
[Music]

00:37:07.750 --> 00:37:07.760 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:37:10.790 --> 00:37:10.800 align:start position:0%
i i think there you have other statutes
 
00:37:13.750 --> 00:37:13.760 align:start position:0%
that relate to whether they're
 
00:37:13.760 --> 00:37:15.510 align:start position:0%
that relate to whether they're
exercising

00:37:15.510 --> 00:37:15.520 align:start position:0%
exercising
 
00:37:15.520 --> 00:37:16.710 align:start position:0%
exercising
political

00:37:16.710 --> 00:37:16.720 align:start position:0%
political
 
00:37:20.790 --> 00:37:20.800 align:start position:0%
uh or performing political activities on
 
00:37:23.190 --> 00:37:23.200 align:start position:0%
the uh time in which that they're
 
00:37:25.910 --> 00:37:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:28.870 --> 00:37:28.880 align:start position:0%
working for those entities be it the
 
00:37:31.109 --> 00:37:31.119 align:start position:0%
school or the the town i think there are
 
00:37:34.150 --> 00:37:34.160 align:start position:0%
other statutes that come into play um in
 
00:37:37.990 --> 00:37:38.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:39.270 --> 00:37:39.280 align:start position:0%
thank you but i don't think that really
 
00:37:41.589 --> 00:37:41.599 align:start position:0%
answered my question i'm sorry um don't
 
00:37:45.109 --> 00:37:45.119 align:start position:0%
be sorry maybe i asked a bad question um
 
00:37:47.910 --> 00:37:47.920 align:start position:0%
the question is if funds are being paid
 
00:37:47.920 --> 00:37:48.829 align:start position:0%
the question is if funds are being paid
to

00:37:48.829 --> 00:37:48.839 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:37:52.790 --> 00:37:52.800 align:start position:0%
individuals at a state county level city
 
00:37:54.950 --> 00:37:54.960 align:start position:0%
level town level
 
00:37:56.950 --> 00:37:56.960 align:start position:0%

00:38:00.630 --> 00:38:00.640 align:start position:0%
paid by county town municipality tax
 
00:38:00.640 --> 00:38:01.589 align:start position:0%
paid by county town municipality tax
dollars

00:38:01.589 --> 00:38:01.599 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:38:03.270 --> 00:38:03.280 align:start position:0%
they come from
 
00:38:04.550 --> 00:38:04.560 align:start position:0%
tax dollars
 
00:38:07.990 --> 00:38:08.000 align:start position:0%
how do we say because we pay you a
 
00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:09.670 align:start position:0%
how do we say because we pay you a
salary

00:38:09.670 --> 00:38:09.680 align:start position:0%
salary
 
00:38:11.430 --> 00:38:11.440 align:start position:0%
how do we say
 
00:38:15.910 --> 00:38:15.920 align:start position:0%
you cannot contribute to a lobbyist
 
00:38:18.630 --> 00:38:18.640 align:start position:0%
to go to concord and lobby for a
 
00:38:21.349 --> 00:38:21.359 align:start position:0%
position because it's coming from
 
00:38:25.030 --> 00:38:25.040 align:start position:0%
money from the towns how do we do that
 
00:38:25.040 --> 00:38:27.030 align:start position:0%
money from the towns how do we do that
um

00:38:27.030 --> 00:38:27.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:28.950 --> 00:38:28.960 align:start position:0%
i'll speak more
 
00:38:28.960 --> 00:38:29.829 align:start position:0%
i'll speak more
maybe

00:38:29.829 --> 00:38:29.839 align:start position:0%
maybe
 
00:38:32.230 --> 00:38:32.240 align:start position:0%
from the county side i'm a little bit
 
00:38:35.349 --> 00:38:35.359 align:start position:0%
familiar with with that in that
 
00:38:37.750 --> 00:38:37.760 align:start position:0%
taxpayer funds
 
00:38:39.349 --> 00:38:39.359 align:start position:0%
go to
 
00:38:41.109 --> 00:38:41.119 align:start position:0%
fund the
 
00:38:43.990 --> 00:38:44.000 align:start position:0%
county operations
 
00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:45.030 align:start position:0%
county operations
for

00:38:45.030 --> 00:38:45.040 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:38:46.550 --> 00:38:46.560 align:start position:0%
county government
 
00:38:49.510 --> 00:38:49.520 align:start position:0%
to then turn around and use those funds
 
00:38:51.190 --> 00:38:51.200 align:start position:0%
from the taxpayers
 
00:38:53.430 --> 00:38:53.440 align:start position:0%
to pay for a lobbyist
 
00:38:53.440 --> 00:38:54.390 align:start position:0%
to pay for a lobbyist
to

00:38:54.390 --> 00:38:54.400 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:38:56.470 --> 00:38:56.480 align:start position:0%
have them come here and lobby on their
 
00:38:56.480 --> 00:38:57.990 align:start position:0%
have them come here and lobby on their
behalf

00:38:57.990 --> 00:38:58.000 align:start position:0%
behalf
 
00:39:02.470 --> 00:39:02.480 align:start position:0%
i think that's the intended
 
00:39:06.470 --> 00:39:06.480 align:start position:0%
focus of this legislation and similar
 
00:39:06.480 --> 00:39:07.670 align:start position:0%
focus of this legislation and similar
existing

00:39:07.670 --> 00:39:07.680 align:start position:0%
existing
 
00:39:12.829 --> 00:39:12.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:12.839 --> 00:39:14.470 align:start position:0%
 
if

00:39:14.470 --> 00:39:14.480 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:39:17.589 --> 00:39:17.599 align:start position:0%
if members in that county or school or
 
00:39:20.630 --> 00:39:20.640 align:start position:0%
municipality are paying
 
00:39:23.349 --> 00:39:23.359 align:start position:0%
their own funds to be a member of the
 
00:39:23.359 --> 00:39:24.550 align:start position:0%
their own funds to be a member of the
union

00:39:24.550 --> 00:39:24.560 align:start position:0%
union
 
00:39:26.710 --> 00:39:26.720 align:start position:0%
and the union then
 
00:39:28.390 --> 00:39:28.400 align:start position:0%
comes down here
 
00:39:30.950 --> 00:39:30.960 align:start position:0%
i do not think that that would apply in
 
00:39:30.960 --> 00:39:31.829 align:start position:0%
i do not think that that would apply in
this

00:39:31.829 --> 00:39:31.839 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:39:34.150 --> 00:39:34.160 align:start position:0%
in this legislation
 
00:39:38.790 --> 00:39:38.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:40.390 --> 00:39:40.400 align:start position:0%
one further question so i just want to
 
00:39:40.400 --> 00:39:41.349 align:start position:0%
one further question so i just want to
make

00:39:41.349 --> 00:39:41.359 align:start position:0%
make
 
00:39:45.030 --> 00:39:45.040 align:start position:0%
it clear to me yes that this would in in
 
00:39:47.670 --> 00:39:47.680 align:start position:0%
your opinion not affect
 
00:39:50.230 --> 00:39:50.240 align:start position:0%
salaries that are paid
 
00:39:53.910 --> 00:39:53.920 align:start position:0%
to public employees with town or county
 
00:39:53.920 --> 00:39:55.510 align:start position:0%
to public employees with town or county
money

00:39:55.510 --> 00:39:55.520 align:start position:0%
money
 
00:39:59.109 --> 00:39:59.119 align:start position:0%
for their salary or for benefits
 
00:40:03.510 --> 00:40:03.520 align:start position:0%
from that salary or benefits being
 
00:40:06.069 --> 00:40:06.079 align:start position:0%
sent to a lobbyist that
 
00:40:09.030 --> 00:40:09.040 align:start position:0%
they support for their position so it
 
00:40:11.190 --> 00:40:11.200 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean salary that's paid by the
 
00:40:13.910 --> 00:40:13.920 align:start position:0%
municipality or the village district it
 
00:40:16.710 --> 00:40:16.720 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean salary it's anything over
 
00:40:19.109 --> 00:40:19.119 align:start position:0%
and above directly from the school
 
00:40:21.510 --> 00:40:21.520 align:start position:0%
department directly from the village
 
00:40:21.520 --> 00:40:22.630 align:start position:0%
department directly from the village
precinct

00:40:22.630 --> 00:40:22.640 align:start position:0%
precinct
 
00:40:25.109 --> 00:40:25.119 align:start position:0%
to a lobbyist not the salaries paid to
 
00:40:27.270 --> 00:40:27.280 align:start position:0%
the employees is that what you're saying
 
00:40:29.990 --> 00:40:30.000 align:start position:0%
yes for instance um
 
00:40:33.750 --> 00:40:33.760 align:start position:0%
let's say a selectmen or a
 
00:40:35.510 --> 00:40:35.520 align:start position:0%
county commissioner
 
00:40:37.990 --> 00:40:38.000 align:start position:0%
their salaries are
 
00:40:39.750 --> 00:40:39.760 align:start position:0%
paid from
 
00:40:43.829 --> 00:40:43.839 align:start position:0%
tax dollars but it is then their money
 
00:40:44.790 --> 00:40:44.800 align:start position:0%
they have
 
00:40:46.309 --> 00:40:46.319 align:start position:0%
earned or
 
00:40:48.710 --> 00:40:48.720 align:start position:0%
presumably are earning their
 
00:40:51.349 --> 00:40:51.359 align:start position:0%
salary and what they do with their own
 
00:40:53.109 --> 00:40:53.119 align:start position:0%
funds whether it's contributing to a
 
00:40:54.870 --> 00:40:54.880 align:start position:0%
union or whatever
 
00:40:56.390 --> 00:40:56.400 align:start position:0%
is their own
 
00:40:56.400 --> 00:40:57.510 align:start position:0%
is their own
choice

00:40:57.510 --> 00:40:57.520 align:start position:0%
choice
 
00:40:59.750 --> 00:40:59.760 align:start position:0%
and would not
 
00:41:02.710 --> 00:41:02.720 align:start position:0%
be impacted by this legislation those
 
00:41:05.750 --> 00:41:05.760 align:start position:0%
elected officials are not required under
 
00:41:05.760 --> 00:41:06.390 align:start position:0%
elected officials are not required under
law

00:41:06.390 --> 00:41:06.400 align:start position:0%
law
 
00:41:08.390 --> 00:41:08.400 align:start position:0%
to be registered to register as
 
00:41:11.349 --> 00:41:11.359 align:start position:0%
lobbyists and therefore um would not be
 
00:41:13.829 --> 00:41:13.839 align:start position:0%
impacted by this legislation
 
00:41:17.910 --> 00:41:17.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:21.750 --> 00:41:21.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:21.760 --> 00:41:23.109 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:41:23.109 --> 00:41:23.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:41:25.510 --> 00:41:25.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um so just to clarify
 
00:41:27.349 --> 00:41:27.359 align:start position:0%
that point um in paragraph one it says
 
00:41:29.750 --> 00:41:29.760 align:start position:0%
no recipient of a grant or appropriation
 
00:41:31.670 --> 00:41:31.680 align:start position:0%
so salary wouldn't fall under the
 
00:41:33.430 --> 00:41:33.440 align:start position:0%
purview of a grant or an appropriation
 
00:41:35.990 --> 00:41:36.000 align:start position:0%
it would be packed correct okay my other
 
00:41:37.829 --> 00:41:37.839 align:start position:0%
question is pretty simple one um when
 
00:41:39.670 --> 00:41:39.680 align:start position:0%
you say physically and financially
 
00:41:43.349 --> 00:41:43.359 align:start position:0%
separate um down on line 12
 
00:41:45.270 --> 00:41:45.280 align:start position:0%
um what what
 
00:41:46.870 --> 00:41:46.880 align:start position:0%
what is the scope of that are we talking
 
00:41:48.550 --> 00:41:48.560 align:start position:0%
just separate bank accounts at the same
 
00:41:50.230 --> 00:41:50.240 align:start position:0%
bank institution are we talking about
 
00:41:51.829 --> 00:41:51.839 align:start position:0%
needing completely separate facilities
 
00:41:54.069 --> 00:41:54.079 align:start position:0%
what's the physical separation right
 
00:41:56.069 --> 00:41:56.079 align:start position:0%
i think as currently
 
00:41:58.470 --> 00:41:58.480 align:start position:0%
in statute in that chapter 15
 
00:42:00.550 --> 00:42:00.560 align:start position:0%
regarding state funds
 
00:42:02.790 --> 00:42:02.800 align:start position:0%
you cannot just
 
00:42:06.630 --> 00:42:06.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:10.150 --> 00:42:10.160 align:start position:0%
entry to say that those state funds or
 
00:42:14.150 --> 00:42:14.160 align:start position:0%
now county funds or whatever
 
00:42:16.710 --> 00:42:16.720 align:start position:0%
are kept in a separate account
 
00:42:16.720 --> 00:42:17.829 align:start position:0%
are kept in a separate account
um

00:42:17.829 --> 00:42:17.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:20.150 --> 00:42:20.160 align:start position:0%
those funds that have come from the
 
00:42:24.230 --> 00:42:24.240 align:start position:0%
taxpayers cannot be used for
 
00:42:26.710 --> 00:42:26.720 align:start position:0%
payment to a lobbyist so it's not just a
 
00:42:26.720 --> 00:42:28.829 align:start position:0%
payment to a lobbyist so it's not just a
bookkeeping

00:42:28.829 --> 00:42:28.839 align:start position:0%
bookkeeping
 
00:42:30.069 --> 00:42:30.079 align:start position:0%
um uh
 
00:42:33.270 --> 00:42:33.280 align:start position:0%
entry that um could be used but it has
 
00:42:35.990 --> 00:42:36.000 align:start position:0%
to be actually separate funds separate
 
00:42:38.950 --> 00:42:38.960 align:start position:0%
physical funds to pay for that um
 
00:42:38.960 --> 00:42:40.630 align:start position:0%
physical funds to pay for that um
lobbyist

00:42:40.630 --> 00:42:40.640 align:start position:0%
lobbyist
 
00:42:41.910 --> 00:42:41.920 align:start position:0%
follow-up i'm sorry i didn't ask for a
 
00:42:43.030 --> 00:42:43.040 align:start position:0%
follow-up before
 
00:42:43.040 --> 00:42:44.550 align:start position:0%
follow-up before
um

00:42:44.550 --> 00:42:44.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:44.560 --> 00:42:45.510 align:start position:0%
um
so

00:42:45.510 --> 00:42:45.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:42:48.630 --> 00:42:48.640 align:start position:0%
is this just a more complicated
 
00:42:48.640 --> 00:42:49.589 align:start position:0%
is this just a more complicated
um

00:42:49.589 --> 00:42:49.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:52.390 --> 00:42:52.400 align:start position:0%
way of essentially just keeping separate
 
00:42:54.710 --> 00:42:54.720 align:start position:0%
books it's the same it's the same
 
00:42:54.720 --> 00:42:56.870 align:start position:0%
books it's the same it's the same
organization

00:42:56.870 --> 00:42:56.880 align:start position:0%
organization
 
00:42:59.910 --> 00:42:59.920 align:start position:0%
of uh assumably the same accountants
 
00:43:02.309 --> 00:43:02.319 align:start position:0%
handling it um
 
00:43:04.150 --> 00:43:04.160 align:start position:0%
what how are you
 
00:43:05.190 --> 00:43:05.200 align:start position:0%
accomplishing what you want to
 
00:43:06.790 --> 00:43:06.800 align:start position:0%
accomplish with this bill
 
00:43:06.800 --> 00:43:07.910 align:start position:0%
accomplish with this bill
um

00:43:07.910 --> 00:43:07.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:10.150 --> 00:43:10.160 align:start position:0%
those taxpayer funds
 
00:43:12.870 --> 00:43:12.880 align:start position:0%
um cannot just be put into
 
00:43:16.069 --> 00:43:16.079 align:start position:0%
account 100 and account 200 let's say
 
00:43:19.270 --> 00:43:19.280 align:start position:0%
and 200 is the account from which
 
00:43:22.390 --> 00:43:22.400 align:start position:0%
payments are made to the lobbying firm
 
00:43:24.230 --> 00:43:24.240 align:start position:0%
um it has to be
 
00:43:27.030 --> 00:43:27.040 align:start position:0%
actual separate funds um
 
00:43:30.630 --> 00:43:30.640 align:start position:0%
whether they're raised from um
 
00:43:31.990 --> 00:43:32.000 align:start position:0%
basically they're raised from other
 
00:43:35.829 --> 00:43:35.839 align:start position:0%
sources other than taxpayer
 
00:43:38.150 --> 00:43:38.160 align:start position:0%
that would have to be used for the
 
00:43:40.150 --> 00:43:40.160 align:start position:0%
lobbying purpose
 
00:43:42.390 --> 00:43:42.400 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:43:44.230 --> 00:43:44.240 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
00:43:46.069 --> 00:43:46.079 align:start position:0%
i have a couple
 
00:43:49.190 --> 00:43:49.200 align:start position:0%
go anywhere great don't go anywhere so
 
00:43:50.710 --> 00:43:50.720 align:start position:0%
it's helpful to this committee in the
 
00:43:53.349 --> 00:43:53.359 align:start position:0%
past um when we were dealing with ethics
 
00:43:56.069 --> 00:43:56.079 align:start position:0%
and and some of those issues to have
 
00:43:57.670 --> 00:43:57.680 align:start position:0%
actual examples
 
00:43:57.680 --> 00:43:58.470 align:start position:0%
actual examples
so

00:43:58.470 --> 00:43:58.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:43:58.480 --> 00:43:59.910 align:start position:0%
so
so

00:43:59.910 --> 00:43:59.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:44:01.990 --> 00:44:02.000 align:start position:0%
just to follow up i think on on
 
00:44:05.349 --> 00:44:05.359 align:start position:0%
representative roulard's questioning um
 
00:44:11.109 --> 00:44:11.119 align:start position:0%
if we had um selectmen that wanted to
 
00:44:12.870 --> 00:44:12.880 align:start position:0%
let the legis
 
00:44:15.750 --> 00:44:15.760 align:start position:0%
committee in the state house
 
00:44:18.069 --> 00:44:18.079 align:start position:0%
be aware of an issue
 
00:44:21.349 --> 00:44:21.359 align:start position:0%
that is affecting their town
 
00:44:24.390 --> 00:44:24.400 align:start position:0%
and they asked their town administrator
 
00:44:27.349 --> 00:44:27.359 align:start position:0%
to come and talk to that committee
 
00:44:28.550 --> 00:44:28.560 align:start position:0%
would that be
 
00:44:32.150 --> 00:44:32.160 align:start position:0%
a violation under this no
 
00:44:32.160 --> 00:44:33.090 align:start position:0%
a violation under this no
if

00:44:33.090 --> 00:44:33.100 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:44:33.100 --> 00:44:35.270 align:start position:0%
if
[Music]

00:44:35.270 --> 00:44:35.280 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:44:37.829 --> 00:44:37.839 align:start position:0%
if a county saw
 
00:44:37.839 --> 00:44:39.430 align:start position:0%
if a county saw
um

00:44:39.430 --> 00:44:39.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:41.750 --> 00:44:41.760 align:start position:0%
a committee in here dealing with uh
 
00:44:46.069 --> 00:44:46.079 align:start position:0%
finances and and they needed
 
00:44:48.870 --> 00:44:48.880 align:start position:0%
the committee to know about situations
 
00:44:51.670 --> 00:44:51.680 align:start position:0%
going on in a county nursing home
 
00:44:51.680 --> 00:44:53.030 align:start position:0%
going on in a county nursing home
um

00:44:53.030 --> 00:44:53.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:55.589 --> 00:44:55.599 align:start position:0%
would would
 
00:44:58.390 --> 00:44:58.400 align:start position:0%
an official from the county coming to
 
00:45:01.670 --> 00:45:01.680 align:start position:0%
the committee would that violate
 
00:45:02.870 --> 00:45:02.880 align:start position:0%
this rule
 
00:45:06.230 --> 00:45:06.240 align:start position:0%
no um or i've run into the situation uh
 
00:45:06.240 --> 00:45:07.670 align:start position:0%
no um or i've run into the situation uh
selectmen

00:45:07.670 --> 00:45:07.680 align:start position:0%
selectmen
 
00:45:11.349 --> 00:45:11.359 align:start position:0%
talking to me in church about
 
00:45:14.230 --> 00:45:14.240 align:start position:0%
legislation uh coming before
 
00:45:15.270 --> 00:45:15.280 align:start position:0%
the house
 
00:45:16.390 --> 00:45:16.400 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
00:45:18.630 --> 00:45:18.640 align:start position:0%
there would be no problem in that either
 
00:45:18.640 --> 00:45:19.510 align:start position:0%
there would be no problem in that either
well

00:45:19.510 --> 00:45:19.520 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:45:21.829 --> 00:45:21.839 align:start position:0%
i think you may get in trouble with some
 
00:45:23.430 --> 00:45:23.440 align:start position:0%
of the people running the church but
 
00:45:25.270 --> 00:45:25.280 align:start position:0%
that um
 
00:45:29.190 --> 00:45:29.200 align:start position:0%
it is um it was after the sermon okay
 
00:45:29.200 --> 00:45:31.270 align:start position:0%
it is um it was after the sermon okay
um

00:45:31.270 --> 00:45:31.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:32.550 --> 00:45:32.560 align:start position:0%
is um
 
00:45:35.750 --> 00:45:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:38.550 --> 00:45:38.560 align:start position:0%
where do you see the line being crossed
 
00:45:41.349 --> 00:45:41.359 align:start position:0%
um is it is it the
 
00:45:43.270 --> 00:45:43.280 align:start position:0%
it's not salary
 
00:45:44.870 --> 00:45:44.880 align:start position:0%
that that
 
00:45:46.470 --> 00:45:46.480 align:start position:0%
meets the definition of grant and
 
00:45:50.870 --> 00:45:50.880 align:start position:0%
appropriation and it's not necessarily
 
00:45:52.630 --> 00:45:52.640 align:start position:0%
someone who is
 
00:45:52.640 --> 00:45:53.990 align:start position:0%
someone who is
defined

00:45:53.990 --> 00:45:54.000 align:start position:0%
defined
 
00:45:58.390 --> 00:45:58.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:58.400 --> 00:45:59.190 align:start position:0%
 
but

00:45:59.190 --> 00:45:59.200 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:46:01.030 --> 00:46:01.040 align:start position:0%
where does that
 
00:46:03.030 --> 00:46:03.040 align:start position:0%
where does that issue
 
00:46:05.910 --> 00:46:05.920 align:start position:0%
arise um
 
00:46:07.910 --> 00:46:07.920 align:start position:0%
again i'll go back to counties i know
 
00:46:09.510 --> 00:46:09.520 align:start position:0%
for many years
 
00:46:09.520 --> 00:46:10.950 align:start position:0%
for many years
um

00:46:10.950 --> 00:46:10.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:13.270 --> 00:46:13.280 align:start position:0%
counties contributed to the county
 
00:46:13.280 --> 00:46:15.030 align:start position:0%
counties contributed to the county
association

00:46:15.030 --> 00:46:15.040 align:start position:0%
association
 
00:46:17.349 --> 00:46:17.359 align:start position:0%
the county association
 
00:46:18.550 --> 00:46:18.560 align:start position:0%
did not
 
00:46:21.030 --> 00:46:21.040 align:start position:0%
pay any lobbying firms
 
00:46:24.309 --> 00:46:24.319 align:start position:0%
that is a fairly recent
 
00:46:24.319 --> 00:46:25.670 align:start position:0%
that is a fairly recent
occurrence

00:46:25.670 --> 00:46:25.680 align:start position:0%
occurrence
 
00:46:27.349 --> 00:46:27.359 align:start position:0%
to my understanding
 
00:46:30.870 --> 00:46:30.880 align:start position:0%
so the county uh paying
 
00:46:33.670 --> 00:46:33.680 align:start position:0%
association dues
 
00:46:35.670 --> 00:46:35.680 align:start position:0%
is is not an issue
 
00:46:39.030 --> 00:46:39.040 align:start position:0%
but when that money then is paid
 
00:46:39.040 --> 00:46:39.910 align:start position:0%
but when that money then is paid
for

00:46:39.910 --> 00:46:39.920 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:46:39.920 --> 00:46:41.750 align:start position:0%
for
someone

00:46:41.750 --> 00:46:41.760 align:start position:0%
someone
 
00:46:44.470 --> 00:46:44.480 align:start position:0%
hired as a lobbyist to lobby the
 
00:46:46.950 --> 00:46:46.960 align:start position:0%
legislature that's where the problem
 
00:46:46.960 --> 00:46:49.430 align:start position:0%
legislature that's where the problem
happens

00:46:49.430 --> 00:46:49.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:52.470 --> 00:46:52.480 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
00:46:54.230 --> 00:46:54.240 align:start position:0%
one further question
 
00:46:56.069 --> 00:46:56.079 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman following up on
 
00:46:58.790 --> 00:46:58.800 align:start position:0%
your question um
 
00:47:01.349 --> 00:47:01.359 align:start position:0%
isn't it typical for an organization to
 
00:47:04.550 --> 00:47:04.560 align:start position:0%
hire a lobbyist on their behalf to come
 
00:47:04.560 --> 00:47:06.309 align:start position:0%
hire a lobbyist on their behalf to come
in

00:47:06.309 --> 00:47:06.319 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:47:08.710 --> 00:47:08.720 align:start position:0%
um thank you for the question um i'm
 
00:47:10.870 --> 00:47:10.880 align:start position:0%
sure many do
 
00:47:10.880 --> 00:47:11.750 align:start position:0%
sure many do
and

00:47:11.750 --> 00:47:11.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:47:13.190 --> 00:47:13.200 align:start position:0%
they would not
 
00:47:15.349 --> 00:47:15.359 align:start position:0%
be prohibited from
 
00:47:17.430 --> 00:47:17.440 align:start position:0%
doing that it's just that they would
 
00:47:20.950 --> 00:47:20.960 align:start position:0%
have to use funds other than
 
00:47:23.670 --> 00:47:23.680 align:start position:0%
taxpayer originated funds in order for
 
00:47:23.680 --> 00:47:25.190 align:start position:0%
taxpayer originated funds in order for
that

00:47:25.190 --> 00:47:25.200 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:47:28.309 --> 00:47:28.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:28.319 --> 00:47:29.829 align:start position:0%
 
follow-up

00:47:29.829 --> 00:47:29.839 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
00:47:32.309 --> 00:47:32.319 align:start position:0%
okay so going back to the county issue
 
00:47:34.069 --> 00:47:34.079 align:start position:0%
we're paying into the accounting
 
00:47:37.030 --> 00:47:37.040 align:start position:0%
organization and the county
 
00:47:39.030 --> 00:47:39.040 align:start position:0%
hire a lobbyist to come on their behalf
 
00:47:41.190 --> 00:47:41.200 align:start position:0%
on perhaps the nursing home or the jail
 
00:47:42.390 --> 00:47:42.400 align:start position:0%
or something
 
00:47:45.750 --> 00:47:45.760 align:start position:0%
that's taxpayer money that's used now
 
00:47:48.069 --> 00:47:48.079 align:start position:0%
isn't it
 
00:47:50.150 --> 00:47:50.160 align:start position:0%
uh taxpayer money
 
00:47:50.160 --> 00:47:51.109 align:start position:0%
uh taxpayer money
now

00:47:51.109 --> 00:47:51.119 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:47:51.119 --> 00:47:52.710 align:start position:0%
now
um

00:47:52.710 --> 00:47:52.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:54.710 --> 00:47:54.720 align:start position:0%
be going to that
 
00:47:54.720 --> 00:47:56.069 align:start position:0%
be going to that
organization

00:47:56.069 --> 00:47:56.079 align:start position:0%
organization
 
00:47:56.079 --> 00:47:57.030 align:start position:0%
organization
yes

00:47:57.030 --> 00:47:57.040 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:48:00.309 --> 00:48:00.319 align:start position:0%
the the issue would arise when
 
00:48:02.870 --> 00:48:02.880 align:start position:0%
the organization then turns around and
 
00:48:04.829 --> 00:48:04.839 align:start position:0%
uses those
 
00:48:07.030 --> 00:48:07.040 align:start position:0%
funds because they originated with the
 
00:48:07.040 --> 00:48:08.390 align:start position:0%
funds because they originated with the
taxpayer

00:48:08.390 --> 00:48:08.400 align:start position:0%
taxpayer
 
00:48:12.309 --> 00:48:12.319 align:start position:0%
to hire someone to lobby the legislature
 
00:48:13.829 --> 00:48:13.839 align:start position:0%
if they use
 
00:48:16.470 --> 00:48:16.480 align:start position:0%
they could go out and
 
00:48:18.230 --> 00:48:18.240 align:start position:0%
do a bake sale
 
00:48:19.990 --> 00:48:20.000 align:start position:0%
and use those funds to pay for the
 
00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:21.109 align:start position:0%
and use those funds to pay for the
lobbyists

00:48:21.109 --> 00:48:21.119 align:start position:0%
lobbyists
 
00:48:22.630 --> 00:48:22.640 align:start position:0%
or funds
 
00:48:24.710 --> 00:48:24.720 align:start position:0%
from any other source other than the
 
00:48:24.720 --> 00:48:26.549 align:start position:0%
from any other source other than the
taxpayer

00:48:26.549 --> 00:48:26.559 align:start position:0%
taxpayer
 
00:48:29.030 --> 00:48:29.040 align:start position:0%

representative
questions

00:48:31.750 --> 00:48:31.760 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:48:34.470 --> 00:48:34.480 align:start position:0%
so these organizations are paid by tax
 
00:48:36.230 --> 00:48:36.240 align:start position:0%
dollars that is how they make their
 
00:48:37.990 --> 00:48:38.000 align:start position:0%
money so if they
 
00:48:40.790 --> 00:48:40.800 align:start position:0%
need to hire a lobbyist for one of their
 
00:48:40.800 --> 00:48:42.710 align:start position:0%
need to hire a lobbyist for one of their
issues

00:48:42.710 --> 00:48:42.720 align:start position:0%
issues
 
00:48:44.950 --> 00:48:44.960 align:start position:0%
doesn't the money naturally come from
 
00:48:47.030 --> 00:48:47.040 align:start position:0%
their source

uh
 
00:48:54.069 --> 00:48:54.079 align:start position:0%

of income
 
00:48:57.589 --> 00:48:57.599 align:start position:0%

instead i'll go with
my

00:50:11.670 --> 00:50:11.680 align:start position:0%
my
 
00:50:13.990 --> 00:50:14.000 align:start position:0%
experiences with the county
 
00:50:16.870 --> 00:50:16.880 align:start position:0%
so legislative advocacy on our end um
 
00:50:19.430 --> 00:50:19.440 align:start position:0%
has been it's very important on
 
00:50:21.190 --> 00:50:21.200 align:start position:0%
any any group
 
00:50:24.390 --> 00:50:24.400 align:start position:0%
there are 1200 bills plus a year that to
 
00:50:26.390 --> 00:50:26.400 align:start position:0%
keep track of that you're asking
 
00:50:28.150 --> 00:50:28.160 align:start position:0%
department head like me iran rockham
 
00:50:30.870 --> 00:50:30.880 align:start position:0%
county jail to try to keep track of and
 
00:50:32.790 --> 00:50:32.800 align:start position:0%
know what's going on and be here all the
 
00:50:35.349 --> 00:50:35.359 align:start position:0%
time where advocacy can be here track
 
00:50:38.230 --> 00:50:38.240 align:start position:0%
the bills for us and also make our
 
00:50:39.430 --> 00:50:39.440 align:start position:0%
voices known
 
00:50:41.750 --> 00:50:41.760 align:start position:0%
we have found that actually it's
 
00:50:44.950 --> 00:50:44.960 align:start position:0%
a much better mechanism of our time and
 
00:50:44.960 --> 00:50:46.309 align:start position:0%
a much better mechanism of our time and
money-wise

00:50:46.309 --> 00:50:46.319 align:start position:0%
money-wise
 
00:50:47.910 --> 00:50:47.920 align:start position:0%
the representative talked about the
 
00:50:50.390 --> 00:50:50.400 align:start position:0%
association of counties and money going
 
00:50:52.549 --> 00:50:52.559 align:start position:0%
to them and then to a lobbyist firm
 
00:50:54.390 --> 00:50:54.400 align:start position:0%
so in the past just to give us past
 
00:50:56.309 --> 00:50:56.319 align:start position:0%
history the association county had a
 
00:50:57.829 --> 00:50:57.839 align:start position:0%
full-time attorney
 
00:50:59.990 --> 00:51:00.000 align:start position:0%
which actually cost us more money than
 
00:51:02.470 --> 00:51:02.480 align:start position:0%
what we're doing now to be down here on
 
00:51:04.390 --> 00:51:04.400 align:start position:0%
behalf of lobbying for us
 
00:51:06.230 --> 00:51:06.240 align:start position:0%
and being here our eyes and ears and we
 
00:51:08.150 --> 00:51:08.160 align:start position:0%
would still come down and testify as
 
00:51:10.230 --> 00:51:10.240 align:start position:0%
subject matter experts
 
00:51:12.630 --> 00:51:12.640 align:start position:0%
as we needed and contact but limit our
 
00:51:14.230 --> 00:51:14.240 align:start position:0%
time so we have found that has saved
 
00:51:16.549 --> 00:51:16.559 align:start position:0%
time and money there in my tenure i've
 
00:51:18.069 --> 00:51:18.079 align:start position:0%
also found
 
00:51:21.190 --> 00:51:21.200 align:start position:0%
well some bills are put in in good faith
 
00:51:23.829 --> 00:51:23.839 align:start position:0%
um one bill is counterintuitive to
 
00:51:26.470 --> 00:51:26.480 align:start position:0%
another bill one bill affects another
 
00:51:28.150 --> 00:51:28.160 align:start position:0%
bill and if we didn't have some sort of
 
00:51:28.160 --> 00:51:29.589 align:start position:0%
bill and if we didn't have some sort of
representation

00:51:29.589 --> 00:51:29.599 align:start position:0%
representation
 
00:51:31.829 --> 00:51:31.839 align:start position:0%
that could keep track of these things
 
00:51:33.589 --> 00:51:33.599 align:start position:0%
i have personally seen the amount of
 
00:51:35.910 --> 00:51:35.920 align:start position:0%
money that we have saved counties and i
 
00:51:37.589 --> 00:51:37.599 align:start position:0%
also sit on the school board as well and
 
00:51:39.829 --> 00:51:39.839 align:start position:0%
school board the money that we've saved
 
00:51:41.270 --> 00:51:41.280 align:start position:0%
and not because of ill will somebody
 
00:51:42.549 --> 00:51:42.559 align:start position:0%
putting something in it just doesn't
 
00:51:44.630 --> 00:51:44.640 align:start position:0%
understand how it affects something else
 
00:51:46.870 --> 00:51:46.880 align:start position:0%
and having our voices heard but to be
 
00:51:49.349 --> 00:51:49.359 align:start position:0%
here all the time and representing that
 
00:51:50.390 --> 00:51:50.400 align:start position:0%
all the time
 
00:51:51.589 --> 00:51:51.599 align:start position:0%
it's still going to be going to be a
 
00:51:53.030 --> 00:51:53.040 align:start position:0%
full-time position at
 
00:51:54.950 --> 00:51:54.960 align:start position:0%
some level somewhere so pulling our
 
00:51:56.710 --> 00:51:56.720 align:start position:0%
money together and having an
 
00:51:59.910 --> 00:51:59.920 align:start position:0%
organization help us is very beneficial
 
00:52:02.790 --> 00:52:02.800 align:start position:0%
and very financially responsible because
 
00:52:04.150 --> 00:52:04.160 align:start position:0%
it costs a lot less than the amount of
 
00:52:05.349 --> 00:52:05.359 align:start position:0%
money that we've saved throughout the
 
00:52:05.359 --> 00:52:06.710 align:start position:0%
money that we've saved throughout the
years

00:52:06.710 --> 00:52:06.720 align:start position:0%
years
 
00:52:07.750 --> 00:52:07.760 align:start position:0%
and i'll leave it there because you do
 
00:52:08.870 --> 00:52:08.880 align:start position:0%
have my do have the letter from
 
00:52:10.390 --> 00:52:10.400 align:start position:0%
association accounting
 
00:52:12.790 --> 00:52:12.800 align:start position:0%
thank you um are you willing to take
 
00:52:15.589 --> 00:52:15.599 align:start position:0%
questions if we have any yes sir
 
00:52:18.630 --> 00:52:18.640 align:start position:0%
we have one representative expedia
 
00:52:19.910 --> 00:52:19.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question thank
 
00:52:21.670 --> 00:52:21.680 align:start position:0%
you mr chair um
 
00:52:23.510 --> 00:52:23.520 align:start position:0%
so would you say that the times that we
 
00:52:25.750 --> 00:52:25.760 align:start position:0%
as a legislature meet are kind of
 
00:52:27.670 --> 00:52:27.680 align:start position:0%
inconvenient because you're out there
 
00:52:29.430 --> 00:52:29.440 align:start position:0%
doing stuff during the day would you
 
00:52:31.109 --> 00:52:31.119 align:start position:0%
find it a little inconvenient to have to
 
00:52:33.990 --> 00:52:34.000 align:start position:0%
come in yeah so
 
00:52:35.510 --> 00:52:35.520 align:start position:0%
i have a full-time job running running
 
00:52:37.750 --> 00:52:37.760 align:start position:0%
at jail so yes it's for different people
 
00:52:39.750 --> 00:52:39.760 align:start position:0%
different days and the multitude of
 
00:52:41.349 --> 00:52:41.359 align:start position:0%
bills that
 
00:52:42.950 --> 00:52:42.960 align:start position:0%
that we that we'd have to take a look at
 
00:52:44.150 --> 00:52:44.160 align:start position:0%
is very um
 
00:52:46.710 --> 00:52:46.720 align:start position:0%
cumbersome yes
 
00:52:51.349 --> 00:52:51.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:54.309 --> 00:52:54.319 align:start position:0%

00:53:15.750 --> 00:53:15.760 align:start position:0%
welcome to legislative administration
 
00:53:18.549 --> 00:53:18.559 align:start position:0%

all right good morning thank you
 
00:53:21.910 --> 00:53:21.920 align:start position:0%
everyone my name is margaret burns i'm
 
00:53:23.349 --> 00:53:23.359 align:start position:0%
the executive director of the new
 
00:53:25.670 --> 00:53:25.680 align:start position:0%
hampshire municipal association and we
 
00:53:27.510 --> 00:53:27.520 align:start position:0%
are here this morning in opposition to
 
00:53:29.670 --> 00:53:29.680 align:start position:0%
house bill 1033
 
00:53:31.910 --> 00:53:31.920 align:start position:0%
house bill 1033 seeks to affect the
 
00:53:34.390 --> 00:53:34.400 align:start position:0%
ability of local officials to engage in
 
00:53:36.309 --> 00:53:36.319 align:start position:0%
the legislative process and to lobby
 
00:53:38.790 --> 00:53:38.800 align:start position:0%
their legislators this legislation
 
00:53:41.589 --> 00:53:41.599 align:start position:0%
affects many different organizations in
 
00:53:43.910 --> 00:53:43.920 align:start position:0%
new hampshire the association of police
 
00:53:45.910 --> 00:53:45.920 align:start position:0%
chiefs the new hampshire association of
 
00:53:48.549 --> 00:53:48.559 align:start position:0%
counties the water works association the
 
00:53:50.230 --> 00:53:50.240 align:start position:0%
assessing officials the building
 
00:53:53.190 --> 00:53:53.200 align:start position:0%
officials and the list goes on and on
 
00:53:55.910 --> 00:53:55.920 align:start position:0%
it is also incredibly far-reaching in
 
00:53:59.109 --> 00:53:59.119 align:start position:0%
its application the legislation says no
 
00:54:02.309 --> 00:54:02.319 align:start position:0%
recipient of a grant or appropriation
 
00:54:04.549 --> 00:54:04.559 align:start position:0%
this could mean that it would apply not
 
00:54:06.790 --> 00:54:06.800 align:start position:0%
only to organizations like the assessing
 
00:54:08.870 --> 00:54:08.880 align:start position:0%
officials and the building officials but
 
00:54:11.270 --> 00:54:11.280 align:start position:0%
it could also apply simply to non-profit
 
00:54:13.109 --> 00:54:13.119 align:start position:0%
organizations that receive
 
00:54:15.589 --> 00:54:15.599 align:start position:0%
appropriations from local governments
 
00:54:17.270 --> 00:54:17.280 align:start position:0%
which is pretty common at the local
 
00:54:19.670 --> 00:54:19.680 align:start position:0%
government level it could also be even
 
00:54:22.150 --> 00:54:22.160 align:start position:0%
applied to businesses that receive funds
 
00:54:24.790 --> 00:54:24.800 align:start position:0%
or contract with municipalities because
 
00:54:26.710 --> 00:54:26.720 align:start position:0%
that could count as an appropriation
 
00:54:29.349 --> 00:54:29.359 align:start position:0%
received from a local government
 
00:54:31.829 --> 00:54:31.839 align:start position:0%
proponents of this legislation may argue
 
00:54:34.309 --> 00:54:34.319 align:start position:0%
that paragraph two creates a sufficient
 
00:54:34.319 --> 00:54:35.510 align:start position:0%
that paragraph two creates a sufficient
exemption

00:54:35.510 --> 00:54:35.520 align:start position:0%
exemption
 
00:54:37.430 --> 00:54:37.440 align:start position:0%
it states that the funds must be
 
00:54:39.349 --> 00:54:39.359 align:start position:0%
physically and
 
00:54:42.230 --> 00:54:42.240 align:start position:0%
financially separated in order for the
 
00:54:45.510 --> 00:54:45.520 align:start position:0%
for the organization to be able to lobby
 
00:54:47.829 --> 00:54:47.839 align:start position:0%
however this physical and financial
 
00:54:50.150 --> 00:54:50.160 align:start position:0%
separation creates an administrative
 
00:54:52.789 --> 00:54:52.799 align:start position:0%
burden for very small organizations that
 
00:54:54.950 --> 00:54:54.960 align:start position:0%
not only provide education and training
 
00:54:58.069 --> 00:54:58.079 align:start position:0%
for local officials but may also provide
 
00:54:59.910 --> 00:54:59.920 align:start position:0%
lobbying services as part of their
 
00:54:59.920 --> 00:55:01.430 align:start position:0%
lobbying services as part of their
organization

00:55:01.430 --> 00:55:01.440 align:start position:0%
organization
 
00:55:03.829 --> 00:55:03.839 align:start position:0%
financially separated may be a clear
 
00:55:06.789 --> 00:55:06.799 align:start position:0%
distinction separating in bank accounts
 
00:55:08.549 --> 00:55:08.559 align:start position:0%
but the question of what it means to
 
00:55:10.630 --> 00:55:10.640 align:start position:0%
physically separate these funds in order
 
00:55:13.030 --> 00:55:13.040 align:start position:0%
to comply with the statute is extremely
 
00:55:13.040 --> 00:55:14.230 align:start position:0%
to comply with the statute is extremely
unclear

00:55:14.230 --> 00:55:14.240 align:start position:0%
unclear
 
00:55:16.150 --> 00:55:16.160 align:start position:0%
when local governments pay dues to
 
00:55:18.789 --> 00:55:18.799 align:start position:0%
organizations like an hma like the
 
00:55:20.390 --> 00:55:20.400 align:start position:0%
building officials like the tax
 
00:55:23.030 --> 00:55:23.040 align:start position:0%
collectors association they are aware
 
00:55:25.349 --> 00:55:25.359 align:start position:0%
that as part of the package they are not
 
00:55:27.750 --> 00:55:27.760 align:start position:0%
only getting the training the resources
 
00:55:30.150 --> 00:55:30.160 align:start position:0%
the publications and the other support
 
00:55:32.230 --> 00:55:32.240 align:start position:0%
that are provided but they may also be
 
00:55:34.549 --> 00:55:34.559 align:start position:0%
getting lobbying and advocacy services
 
00:55:39.270 --> 00:55:39.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:40.870 --> 00:55:40.880 align:start position:0%
there was
 
00:55:44.150 --> 00:55:44.160 align:start position:0%
testimony earlier as well that i wanted
 
00:55:46.710 --> 00:55:46.720 align:start position:0%
to address one of the items brought up
 
00:55:49.190 --> 00:55:49.200 align:start position:0%
was that it is not known or that it is
 
00:55:52.549 --> 00:55:52.559 align:start position:0%
unclear how much money is spent on you
 
00:55:54.710 --> 00:55:54.720 align:start position:0%
know how much taxpayer money is spent at
 
00:55:57.030 --> 00:55:57.040 align:start position:0%
the local level on lobbying
 
00:55:58.950 --> 00:55:58.960 align:start position:0%
speaking for nhma
 
00:56:01.030 --> 00:56:01.040 align:start position:0%
i'm a registered lobbyist and executive
 
00:56:03.190 --> 00:56:03.200 align:start position:0%
director of the organization we have two
 
00:56:05.589 --> 00:56:05.599 align:start position:0%
other registered lobbyists
 
00:56:08.789 --> 00:56:08.799 align:start position:0%
as required by law we report quarterly
 
00:56:11.190 --> 00:56:11.200 align:start position:0%
how much is expended and how much on
 
00:56:13.990 --> 00:56:14.000 align:start position:0%
revenue is used on lobbying services we
 
00:56:15.829 --> 00:56:15.839 align:start position:0%
report that to the secretary of state's
 
00:56:18.390 --> 00:56:18.400 align:start position:0%
office and that information is publicly
 
00:56:20.470 --> 00:56:20.480 align:start position:0%
available and that is already required
 
00:56:23.190 --> 00:56:23.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:23.200 --> 00:56:25.349 align:start position:0%
 
finally

00:56:25.349 --> 00:56:25.359 align:start position:0%
finally
 
00:56:27.349 --> 00:56:27.359 align:start position:0%
there were some questions asked earlier
 
00:56:29.030 --> 00:56:29.040 align:start position:0%
good questions about how this
 
00:56:31.750 --> 00:56:31.760 align:start position:0%
legislation would affect for example a
 
00:56:33.990 --> 00:56:34.000 align:start position:0%
local official a town administrator or a
 
00:56:36.150 --> 00:56:36.160 align:start position:0%
select board member who wishes to come
 
00:56:38.150 --> 00:56:38.160 align:start position:0%
and speak to a committee
 
00:56:39.910 --> 00:56:39.920 align:start position:0%
and provide a position
 
00:56:41.670 --> 00:56:41.680 align:start position:0%
or wishes to send a letter to that
 
00:56:44.069 --> 00:56:44.079 align:start position:0%
committee and if this legislation
 
00:56:46.150 --> 00:56:46.160 align:start position:0%
doesn't affect that why is this
 
00:56:48.549 --> 00:56:48.559 align:start position:0%
legislation so problematic and i'd like
 
00:56:49.990 --> 00:56:50.000 align:start position:0%
to address that
 
00:56:52.870 --> 00:56:52.880 align:start position:0%
there are approximately 300 bills and
 
00:56:54.870 --> 00:56:54.880 align:start position:0%
i'm just speaking from the new hampshire
 
00:56:57.270 --> 00:56:57.280 align:start position:0%
municipal association's perspective
 
00:57:00.630 --> 00:57:00.640 align:start position:0%
there are about 300 bills a session
 
00:57:03.309 --> 00:57:03.319 align:start position:0%
that affect local government
 
00:57:06.230 --> 00:57:06.240 align:start position:0%
municipalities have realized that it is
 
00:57:08.789 --> 00:57:08.799 align:start position:0%
more cost effective for them to be a
 
00:57:11.750 --> 00:57:11.760 align:start position:0%
member of an organization that not only
 
00:57:14.150 --> 00:57:14.160 align:start position:0%
follows those bills keeps them up to
 
00:57:16.789 --> 00:57:16.799 align:start position:0%
date on those bills but also goes to the
 
00:57:19.270 --> 00:57:19.280 align:start position:0%
legislature on their behalf to speak to
 
00:57:21.589 --> 00:57:21.599 align:start position:0%
committees about what bills are positive
 
00:57:23.510 --> 00:57:23.520 align:start position:0%
for local government what bills are
 
00:57:25.670 --> 00:57:25.680 align:start position:0%
negative for local government and also
 
00:57:27.910 --> 00:57:27.920 align:start position:0%
to simply work with legislators and
 
00:57:30.870 --> 00:57:30.880 align:start position:0%
committees to understand how the bills
 
00:57:33.589 --> 00:57:33.599 align:start position:0%
impact local government and so for that
 
00:57:35.829 --> 00:57:35.839 align:start position:0%
reason municipalities have seen this as
 
00:57:38.549 --> 00:57:38.559 align:start position:0%
a more cost effective way to be engaged
 
00:57:40.789 --> 00:57:40.799 align:start position:0%
in their legislative process rather than
 
00:57:43.670 --> 00:57:43.680 align:start position:0%
to send every to every hearing to send
 
00:57:46.150 --> 00:57:46.160 align:start position:0%
local officials elected or appointed to
 
00:57:48.549 --> 00:57:48.559 align:start position:0%
be part of that hearing and to testify
 
00:57:50.870 --> 00:57:50.880 align:start position:0%
so that is one of the primary reasons
 
00:57:53.190 --> 00:57:53.200 align:start position:0%
that municipalities see the value and
 
00:57:54.950 --> 00:57:54.960 align:start position:0%
the cost benefit in being part of
 
00:57:56.710 --> 00:57:56.720 align:start position:0%
organizations like the new hampshire
 
00:57:59.030 --> 00:57:59.040 align:start position:0%
municipal association and the many other
 
00:58:00.470 --> 00:58:00.480 align:start position:0%
organizations that come before
 
00:58:02.549 --> 00:58:02.559 align:start position:0%
legislative committees on municipal
 
00:58:02.559 --> 00:58:04.150 align:start position:0%
legislative committees on municipal
issues

00:58:04.150 --> 00:58:04.160 align:start position:0%
issues
 
00:58:05.910 --> 00:58:05.920 align:start position:0%
that concludes my testimony and i am
 
00:58:07.990 --> 00:58:08.000 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions thank you
 
00:58:09.829 --> 00:58:09.839 align:start position:0%
for your testimony are there further
 
00:58:11.990 --> 00:58:12.000 align:start position:0%
questions i see one representative
 
00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:14.950 align:start position:0%
questions i see one representative
roulard

00:58:14.950 --> 00:58:14.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:18.549 --> 00:58:18.559 align:start position:0%
thank you for coming today uh i think
 
00:58:20.549 --> 00:58:20.559 align:start position:0%
and correct me if i'm wrong
 
00:58:23.829 --> 00:58:23.839 align:start position:0%
the gist of your testimony today
 
00:58:25.510 --> 00:58:25.520 align:start position:0%
is that
 
00:58:27.430 --> 00:58:27.440 align:start position:0%
we really should leave this to the towns
 
00:58:29.670 --> 00:58:29.680 align:start position:0%
you municipalities to deal with what is
 
00:58:31.750 --> 00:58:31.760 align:start position:0%
most cost effective and efficient for
 
00:58:31.760 --> 00:58:32.710 align:start position:0%
most cost effective and efficient for
them

00:58:32.710 --> 00:58:32.720 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:58:35.190 --> 00:58:35.200 align:start position:0%
and not pass statewide legislation am i
 
00:58:37.270 --> 00:58:37.280 align:start position:0%
right on that i don't think i could have
 
00:58:39.670 --> 00:58:39.680 align:start position:0%
said it any better yes that is correct
 
00:58:41.910 --> 00:58:41.920 align:start position:0%
and indeed the spending of funds on
 
00:58:43.430 --> 00:58:43.440 align:start position:0%
being a membership a member of an
 
00:58:45.510 --> 00:58:45.520 align:start position:0%
organization like nhma or any other
 
00:58:45.520 --> 00:58:46.789 align:start position:0%
organization like nhma or any other
organization

00:58:46.789 --> 00:58:46.799 align:start position:0%
organization
 
00:58:49.109 --> 00:58:49.119 align:start position:0%
is part of the budget and in most of our
 
00:58:51.109 --> 00:58:51.119 align:start position:0%
municipalities that budget is passed by
 
00:58:52.630 --> 00:58:52.640 align:start position:0%
the voters at town meeting because
 
00:58:54.870 --> 00:58:54.880 align:start position:0%
that's our primary form of government
 
00:58:57.030 --> 00:58:57.040 align:start position:0%
and indeed the decision not only should
 
00:58:58.870 --> 00:58:58.880 align:start position:0%
be left at the local level for
 
00:59:01.109 --> 00:59:01.119 align:start position:0%
municipalities but it should be left at
 
00:59:03.190 --> 00:59:03.200 align:start position:0%
the state level for the state and the
 
00:59:05.190 --> 00:59:05.200 align:start position:0%
state has been in
 
00:59:07.430 --> 00:59:07.440 align:start position:0%
prior years and and i believe in current
 
00:59:09.829 --> 00:59:09.839 align:start position:0%
times the state has seen fit to be part
 
00:59:11.270 --> 00:59:11.280 align:start position:0%
of the national conference of state
 
00:59:14.150 --> 00:59:14.160 align:start position:0%
legislatures which is a bipartisan
 
00:59:15.910 --> 00:59:15.920 align:start position:0%
lobbying organization that many
 
00:59:17.670 --> 00:59:17.680 align:start position:0%
legislators legislatures around the
 
00:59:17.680 --> 00:59:18.470 align:start position:0%
legislators legislatures around the
country

00:59:18.470 --> 00:59:18.480 align:start position:0%
country
 
00:59:20.150 --> 00:59:20.160 align:start position:0%
are members of because they see the
 
00:59:23.109 --> 00:59:23.119 align:start position:0%
value and having advocacy at the federal
 
00:59:23.119 --> 00:59:25.030 align:start position:0%
value and having advocacy at the federal
level

00:59:25.030 --> 00:59:25.040 align:start position:0%
level
 
00:59:27.349 --> 00:59:27.359 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:59:31.190 --> 00:59:31.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:34.230 --> 00:59:34.240 align:start position:0%
um we currently have in statute section
 
00:59:36.470 --> 00:59:36.480 align:start position:0%
15 colon 5.
 
00:59:38.789 --> 00:59:38.799 align:start position:0%
that says
 
00:59:41.510 --> 00:59:41.520 align:start position:0%
no recipient of a grant or appropriation
 
00:59:45.030 --> 00:59:45.040 align:start position:0%
of state funds may use the state funds
 
00:59:47.190 --> 00:59:47.200 align:start position:0%
to lobby or attempt to influence
 
00:59:49.510 --> 00:59:49.520 align:start position:0%
legislation participate in political
 
00:59:51.990 --> 00:59:52.000 align:start position:0%
activity or contribute funds to any
 
00:59:52.000 --> 00:59:53.109 align:start position:0%
activity or contribute funds to any
entity

00:59:53.109 --> 00:59:53.119 align:start position:0%
entity
 
00:59:55.990 --> 00:59:56.000 align:start position:0%
engaged in these activities
 
00:59:57.670 --> 00:59:57.680 align:start position:0%
i'm assuming
 
00:59:58.710 --> 00:59:58.720 align:start position:0%
and and
 
01:00:00.230 --> 01:00:00.240 align:start position:0%
you've correctly pointed out that the
 
01:00:00.240 --> 01:00:01.030 align:start position:0%
you've correctly pointed out that the
way

01:00:01.030 --> 01:00:01.040 align:start position:0%
way
 
01:00:03.750 --> 01:00:03.760 align:start position:0%
they circumvent or
 
01:00:05.430 --> 01:00:05.440 align:start position:0%
work with that
 
01:00:08.470 --> 01:00:08.480 align:start position:0%
provision is to physically separate the
 
01:00:11.349 --> 01:00:11.359 align:start position:0%
funds so they're they're not using state
 
01:00:14.470 --> 01:00:14.480 align:start position:0%
funds in order to pay for those lobbying
 
01:00:14.480 --> 01:00:15.910 align:start position:0%
funds in order to pay for those lobbying
activities

01:00:15.910 --> 01:00:15.920 align:start position:0%
activities
 
01:00:15.920 --> 01:00:16.710 align:start position:0%
activities
so

01:00:16.710 --> 01:00:16.720 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:00:20.390 --> 01:00:20.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:23.109 --> 01:00:23.119 align:start position:0%
where the goal is to not
 
01:00:23.119 --> 01:00:23.910 align:start position:0%
where the goal is to not
have

01:00:23.910 --> 01:00:23.920 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:00:25.510 --> 01:00:25.520 align:start position:0%
state funds
 
01:00:27.030 --> 01:00:27.040 align:start position:0%
pay for
 
01:00:27.040 --> 01:00:28.549 align:start position:0%
pay for
influencing

01:00:28.549 --> 01:00:28.559 align:start position:0%
influencing
 
01:00:33.190 --> 01:00:33.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:36.390 --> 01:00:36.400 align:start position:0%
what would be wrong than with
 
01:00:37.990 --> 01:00:38.000 align:start position:0%
any of the other entities that are
 
01:00:39.910 --> 01:00:39.920 align:start position:0%
mentioned in the bill county municipal
 
01:00:42.230 --> 01:00:42.240 align:start position:0%
school district to also be able to
 
01:00:45.430 --> 01:00:45.440 align:start position:0%
separate or segregate what are state
 
01:00:47.510 --> 01:00:47.520 align:start position:0%
funds and what are funds from the
 
01:00:50.710 --> 01:00:50.720 align:start position:0%
taxpayers of those other entities
 
01:00:52.549 --> 01:00:52.559 align:start position:0%
to to do the same thing that we're
 
01:00:55.109 --> 01:00:55.119 align:start position:0%
currently doing with just state funds
 
01:00:57.670 --> 01:00:57.680 align:start position:0%
thank you i appreciate that question i
 
01:01:00.870 --> 01:01:00.880 align:start position:0%
can't speak to what the state is doing
 
01:01:03.270 --> 01:01:03.280 align:start position:0%
with in the means of separating its
 
01:01:05.430 --> 01:01:05.440 align:start position:0%
funds for the purpose of lobbying i i
 
01:01:07.510 --> 01:01:07.520 align:start position:0%
can't speak to the state's own physical
 
01:01:10.150 --> 01:01:10.160 align:start position:0%
and financial separation of state funds
 
01:01:11.589 --> 01:01:11.599 align:start position:0%
for that purpose
 
01:01:13.910 --> 01:01:13.920 align:start position:0%
what i can speak to is the
 
01:01:16.230 --> 01:01:16.240 align:start position:0%
administrative burden that it would put
 
01:01:19.349 --> 01:01:19.359 align:start position:0%
on the many different small local
 
01:01:21.990 --> 01:01:22.000 align:start position:0%
government related organizations that
 
01:01:23.670 --> 01:01:23.680 align:start position:0%
would be affected and that would be
 
01:01:26.309 --> 01:01:26.319 align:start position:0%
required to financially and physically
 
01:01:29.510 --> 01:01:29.520 align:start position:0%
separate their funds again financially
 
01:01:32.150 --> 01:01:32.160 align:start position:0%
separate i assume means separate bank
 
01:01:34.950 --> 01:01:34.960 align:start position:0%
accounts i think we can all get behind
 
01:01:36.710 --> 01:01:36.720 align:start position:0%
that definition and we know the
 
01:01:38.470 --> 01:01:38.480 align:start position:0%
difference between a mere bookkeeping
 
01:01:40.870 --> 01:01:40.880 align:start position:0%
entry and an actual separate bank
 
01:01:40.880 --> 01:01:42.150 align:start position:0%
entry and an actual separate bank
account

01:01:42.150 --> 01:01:42.160 align:start position:0%
account
 
01:01:44.390 --> 01:01:44.400 align:start position:0%
uh physically separate is something that
 
01:01:47.109 --> 01:01:47.119 align:start position:0%
is less clear to me what is meant by
 
01:01:49.109 --> 01:01:49.119 align:start position:0%
that and so when i think about the
 
01:01:51.910 --> 01:01:51.920 align:start position:0%
dozens of local government entities
 
01:01:53.829 --> 01:01:53.839 align:start position:0%
local government organizations across
 
01:01:56.630 --> 01:01:56.640 align:start position:0%
the state tiny organizations putting
 
01:01:59.510 --> 01:01:59.520 align:start position:0%
nhma aside tiny organizations that are
 
01:02:02.309 --> 01:02:02.319 align:start position:0%
run by municipal officials who volunteer
 
01:02:04.789 --> 01:02:04.799 align:start position:0%
their time to run organizations that
 
01:02:07.270 --> 01:02:07.280 align:start position:0%
provide training that provide workshops
 
01:02:09.910 --> 01:02:09.920 align:start position:0%
and that also may lobby
 
01:02:12.470 --> 01:02:12.480 align:start position:0%
that burden on them to do the financial
 
01:02:15.670 --> 01:02:15.680 align:start position:0%
and physical separation of
 
01:02:17.029 --> 01:02:17.039 align:start position:0%
revenue that comes in from
 
01:02:20.230 --> 01:02:20.240 align:start position:0%
municipalities is going to effectively
 
01:02:21.990 --> 01:02:22.000 align:start position:0%
shut them down because the ability to
 
01:02:24.710 --> 01:02:24.720 align:start position:0%
comply with that um is simply an
 
01:02:27.029 --> 01:02:27.039 align:start position:0%
administrative burden that seeks to shut
 
01:02:28.549 --> 01:02:28.559 align:start position:0%
them down and to stop them from doing
 
01:02:30.870 --> 01:02:30.880 align:start position:0%
what they're doing
 
01:02:32.630 --> 01:02:32.640 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for your
 
01:02:35.829 --> 01:02:35.839 align:start position:0%
answer i i'm not sure
 
01:02:35.839 --> 01:02:38.069 align:start position:0%
answer i i'm not sure
um

01:02:38.069 --> 01:02:38.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:02:41.029 --> 01:02:41.039 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure i understand completely
 
01:02:42.390 --> 01:02:42.400 align:start position:0%
it's not
 
01:02:44.069 --> 01:02:44.079 align:start position:0%
it's my understanding
 
01:02:44.079 --> 01:02:45.029 align:start position:0%
it's my understanding
that

01:02:45.029 --> 01:02:45.039 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:02:47.510 --> 01:02:47.520 align:start position:0%
it's not how the state separates their
 
01:02:47.520 --> 01:02:48.470 align:start position:0%
it's not how the state separates their
funding

01:02:48.470 --> 01:02:48.480 align:start position:0%
funding
 
01:02:50.549 --> 01:02:50.559 align:start position:0%
it's how these entities that receive
 
01:02:52.950 --> 01:02:52.960 align:start position:0%
state funding currently
 
01:02:55.270 --> 01:02:55.280 align:start position:0%
cannot use those funds
 
01:02:57.349 --> 01:02:57.359 align:start position:0%
for lobbying
 
01:02:59.430 --> 01:02:59.440 align:start position:0%
activities so
 
01:03:01.910 --> 01:03:01.920 align:start position:0%
a school department if they receive
 
01:03:03.510 --> 01:03:03.520 align:start position:0%
state money
 
01:03:06.549 --> 01:03:06.559 align:start position:0%
they must physically have that money in
 
01:03:08.549 --> 01:03:08.559 align:start position:0%
a separate checking account
 
01:03:11.990 --> 01:03:12.000 align:start position:0%
and can't use those dollars to pay
 
01:03:14.069 --> 01:03:14.079 align:start position:0%
for lobbying activities back to the
 
01:03:14.079 --> 01:03:15.109 align:start position:0%
for lobbying activities back to the
state

01:03:15.109 --> 01:03:15.119 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:03:17.029 --> 01:03:17.039 align:start position:0%
that's how it that's how it's currently
 
01:03:17.039 --> 01:03:18.069 align:start position:0%
that's how it that's how it's currently
understood

01:03:18.069 --> 01:03:18.079 align:start position:0%
understood
 
01:03:19.589 --> 01:03:19.599 align:start position:0%
by me
 
01:03:19.599 --> 01:03:21.349 align:start position:0%
by me
um

01:03:21.349 --> 01:03:21.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:03:23.910 --> 01:03:23.920 align:start position:0%
and that's my reading of this
 
01:03:23.920 --> 01:03:25.190 align:start position:0%
and that's my reading of this
so

01:03:25.190 --> 01:03:25.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:03:26.710 --> 01:03:26.720 align:start position:0%
i guess
 
01:03:29.589 --> 01:03:29.599 align:start position:0%
to to restate my question
 
01:03:29.599 --> 01:03:30.470 align:start position:0%
to to restate my question
if

01:03:30.470 --> 01:03:30.480 align:start position:0%
if
 
01:03:33.109 --> 01:03:33.119 align:start position:0%
if those entities currently are are
 
01:03:35.349 --> 01:03:35.359 align:start position:0%
having to separate or segregate
 
01:03:35.359 --> 01:03:36.950 align:start position:0%
having to separate or segregate
physically

01:03:36.950 --> 01:03:36.960 align:start position:0%
physically
 
01:03:39.270 --> 01:03:39.280 align:start position:0%
state funds to do that
 
01:03:41.510 --> 01:03:41.520 align:start position:0%
why would they not why would these other
 
01:03:41.520 --> 01:03:42.470 align:start position:0%
why would they not why would these other
four

01:03:42.470 --> 01:03:42.480 align:start position:0%
four
 
01:03:45.510 --> 01:03:45.520 align:start position:0%
entities not also be able to segregate
 
01:03:48.710 --> 01:03:48.720 align:start position:0%
the funds that come from
 
01:03:51.670 --> 01:03:51.680 align:start position:0%
those entities in order to pay for that
 
01:03:54.309 --> 01:03:54.319 align:start position:0%
that lobbying elsewhere thank you i i
 
01:03:56.950 --> 01:03:56.960 align:start position:0%
understand um your question that is not
 
01:03:58.710 --> 01:03:58.720 align:start position:0%
my understanding of current law and of
 
01:04:00.789 --> 01:04:00.799 align:start position:0%
course i do not represent school
 
01:04:02.549 --> 01:04:02.559 align:start position:0%
districts so i can't speak to that
 
01:04:04.470 --> 01:04:04.480 align:start position:0%
particular scenario that you're giving
 
01:04:07.270 --> 01:04:07.280 align:start position:0%
me so i apologize to that um but my
 
01:04:09.670 --> 01:04:09.680 align:start position:0%
second point that applies somewhat to
 
01:04:11.589 --> 01:04:11.599 align:start position:0%
your question when i think about the
 
01:04:13.430 --> 01:04:13.440 align:start position:0%
other organizations in the state that
 
01:04:15.670 --> 01:04:15.680 align:start position:0%
would be affected like assessing
 
01:04:17.750 --> 01:04:17.760 align:start position:0%
officials building officials they
 
01:04:17.760 --> 01:04:19.029 align:start position:0%
officials building officials they
receive

01:04:19.029 --> 01:04:19.039 align:start position:0%
receive
 
01:04:22.710 --> 01:04:22.720 align:start position:0%
all most if not all of the dues that
 
01:04:25.190 --> 01:04:25.200 align:start position:0%
they receive in order to be functioning
 
01:04:25.200 --> 01:04:26.470 align:start position:0%
they receive in order to be functioning
organizations

01:04:26.470 --> 01:04:26.480 align:start position:0%
organizations
 
01:04:28.549 --> 01:04:28.559 align:start position:0%
they are entirely
 
01:04:31.430 --> 01:04:31.440 align:start position:0%
from municipalities they are entirely
 
01:04:34.309 --> 01:04:34.319 align:start position:0%
municipal funds that go to those tiny
 
01:04:36.950 --> 01:04:36.960 align:start position:0%
organizations to allow them to exist and
 
01:04:39.510 --> 01:04:39.520 align:start position:0%
to do what they do so in scenarios like
 
01:04:39.520 --> 01:04:40.549 align:start position:0%
to do what they do so in scenarios like
that

01:04:40.549 --> 01:04:40.559 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:04:43.349 --> 01:04:43.359 align:start position:0%
it is not possible for them to separate
 
01:04:47.190 --> 01:04:47.200 align:start position:0%
out municipal or taxpayer funds in order
 
01:04:50.150 --> 01:04:50.160 align:start position:0%
to lobby they would simply be unable to
 
01:04:50.160 --> 01:04:51.589 align:start position:0%
to lobby they would simply be unable to
lobby

01:04:51.589 --> 01:04:51.599 align:start position:0%
lobby
 
01:04:54.150 --> 01:04:54.160 align:start position:0%
and that means simply be unable to send
 
01:04:56.549 --> 01:04:56.559 align:start position:0%
someone on behalf of the organization
 
01:04:58.069 --> 01:04:58.079 align:start position:0%
and the municipal officials that are
 
01:05:00.069 --> 01:05:00.079 align:start position:0%
part of that organization to the
 
01:05:02.549 --> 01:05:02.559 align:start position:0%
legislature to do exactly what i'm doing
 
01:05:05.029 --> 01:05:05.039 align:start position:0%
here to talk about legislation with the
 
01:05:07.109 --> 01:05:07.119 align:start position:0%
committees to talk about how it could be
 
01:05:08.950 --> 01:05:08.960 align:start position:0%
fixed to have a better impact on local
 
01:05:11.190 --> 01:05:11.200 align:start position:0%
government so so that's how it would
 
01:05:13.190 --> 01:05:13.200 align:start position:0%
affect the many organizations in the
 
01:05:14.710 --> 01:05:14.720 align:start position:0%
state like that
 
01:05:16.470 --> 01:05:16.480 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for your answer and i do
 
01:05:16.480 --> 01:05:17.829 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for your answer and i do
understand

01:05:17.829 --> 01:05:17.839 align:start position:0%
understand
 
01:05:21.510 --> 01:05:21.520 align:start position:0%
they still would be able to
 
01:05:24.470 --> 01:05:24.480 align:start position:0%
directly influence
 
01:05:26.789 --> 01:05:26.799 align:start position:0%
themselves they just wouldn't be able to
 
01:05:29.349 --> 01:05:29.359 align:start position:0%
use utilize the funds
 
01:05:32.630 --> 01:05:32.640 align:start position:0%
to hire a firm to speak for them is that
 
01:05:35.109 --> 01:05:35.119 align:start position:0%
fair to say i believe that's correct and
 
01:05:37.190 --> 01:05:37.200 align:start position:0%
in many circumstances that is the most
 
01:05:39.190 --> 01:05:39.200 align:start position:0%
cost effective way for them to have
 
01:05:42.470 --> 01:05:42.480 align:start position:0%
their voice heard thank you thank you
 
01:05:42.480 --> 01:05:43.349 align:start position:0%
their voice heard thank you thank you
uh

01:05:43.349 --> 01:05:43.359 align:start position:0%

uh
 
01:06:02.630 --> 01:06:02.640 align:start position:0%
committee members for allowing me to
 
01:06:04.789 --> 01:06:04.799 align:start position:0%
speak here today
 
01:06:07.270 --> 01:06:07.280 align:start position:0%
um my name is ken robinshaw i spent 19
 
01:06:08.309 --> 01:06:08.319 align:start position:0%
years in
 
01:06:10.710 --> 01:06:10.720 align:start position:0%
in the county operations and i spent the
 
01:06:13.990 --> 01:06:14.000 align:start position:0%
last two years in a town operation so
 
01:06:16.390 --> 01:06:16.400 align:start position:0%
i know both sides of the operations
 
01:06:17.829 --> 01:06:17.839 align:start position:0%
but i'm here to testify today in
 
01:06:20.870 --> 01:06:20.880 align:start position:0%
opposition of house bill 1033
 
01:06:22.710 --> 01:06:22.720 align:start position:0%
this bill in its entirety is wrong and
 
01:06:24.390 --> 01:06:24.400 align:start position:0%
goes against all that new hampshire
 
01:06:26.950 --> 01:06:26.960 align:start position:0%
towns stand for and represent
 
01:06:28.630 --> 01:06:28.640 align:start position:0%
each town in new hampshire is unique and
 
01:06:30.549 --> 01:06:30.559 align:start position:0%
each town has its own strengths and its
 
01:06:33.270 --> 01:06:33.280 align:start position:0%
own weaknesses
 
01:06:34.870 --> 01:06:34.880 align:start position:0%
the town of northfield is no different
 
01:06:37.750 --> 01:06:37.760 align:start position:0%
than an ordinary new hampshire town
 
01:06:39.589 --> 01:06:39.599 align:start position:0%
the town of northfield has a budget
 
01:06:39.599 --> 01:06:40.630 align:start position:0%
the town of northfield has a budget
committee

01:06:40.630 --> 01:06:40.640 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:06:42.789 --> 01:06:42.799 align:start position:0%
that scrutinizes each appropriation in
 
01:06:44.549 --> 01:06:44.559 align:start position:0%
each expenditure
 
01:06:45.990 --> 01:06:46.000 align:start position:0%
the town on lower field has three
 
01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:47.270 align:start position:0%
the town on lower field has three
selectmen

01:06:47.270 --> 01:06:47.280 align:start position:0%
selectmen
 
01:06:49.990 --> 01:06:50.000 align:start position:0%
that review each appropriation and each
 
01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:51.510 align:start position:0%
that review each appropriation and each
expenditure

01:06:51.510 --> 01:06:51.520 align:start position:0%
expenditure
 
01:06:54.390 --> 01:06:54.400 align:start position:0%
the town of norfield has a town meeting
 
01:06:56.789 --> 01:06:56.799 align:start position:0%
each march and at that time meeting the
 
01:06:59.270 --> 01:06:59.280 align:start position:0%
residents vote for all appropriations
 
01:07:00.950 --> 01:07:00.960 align:start position:0%
and establish a budget
 
01:07:03.349 --> 01:07:03.359 align:start position:0%
that the town must live within
 
01:07:05.349 --> 01:07:05.359 align:start position:0%
these are the people that should decide
 
01:07:07.029 --> 01:07:07.039 align:start position:0%
how their tax dollars are spent in their
 
01:07:07.039 --> 01:07:08.309 align:start position:0%
how their tax dollars are spent in their
towns

01:07:08.309 --> 01:07:08.319 align:start position:0%
towns
 
01:07:12.390 --> 01:07:12.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:12.400 --> 01:07:13.349 align:start position:0%
 
the

01:07:13.349 --> 01:07:13.359 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:07:14.710 --> 01:07:14.720 align:start position:0%
the selectmen
 
01:07:19.670 --> 01:07:19.680 align:start position:0%
uh have voted in opposition of hb 1033
 
01:07:21.510 --> 01:07:21.520 align:start position:0%
as we believe this legislation will
 
01:07:24.470 --> 01:07:24.480 align:start position:0%
place an undue burden on towns
 
01:07:26.309 --> 01:07:26.319 align:start position:0%
as it was stated today there were over
 
01:07:28.630 --> 01:07:28.640 align:start position:0%
300 bills that that
 
01:07:30.309 --> 01:07:30.319 align:start position:0%
are monitored
 
01:07:33.029 --> 01:07:33.039 align:start position:0%
the town of northfield utilizes new
 
01:07:35.029 --> 01:07:35.039 align:start position:0%
hampshire and missile association to
 
01:07:37.029 --> 01:07:37.039 align:start position:0%
advocate on behalf of the town of
 
01:07:39.990 --> 01:07:40.000 align:start position:0%
norfield which saves us time and also
 
01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:41.430 align:start position:0%
norfield which saves us time and also
money

01:07:41.430 --> 01:07:41.440 align:start position:0%
money
 
01:07:43.910 --> 01:07:43.920 align:start position:0%
the town of norfolk also believes that
 
01:07:43.920 --> 01:07:44.950 align:start position:0%
the town of norfolk also believes that
through

01:07:44.950 --> 01:07:44.960 align:start position:0%
through
 
01:07:44.960 --> 01:07:45.990 align:start position:0%
through
through

01:07:45.990 --> 01:07:46.000 align:start position:0%
through
 
01:07:47.990 --> 01:07:48.000 align:start position:0%
through the budget process
 
01:07:50.309 --> 01:07:50.319 align:start position:0%
that if the town did not want to spend
 
01:07:52.870 --> 01:07:52.880 align:start position:0%
the money on on association then they
 
01:07:53.829 --> 01:07:53.839 align:start position:0%
wouldn't spend the money on the
 
01:07:53.839 --> 01:07:55.670 align:start position:0%
wouldn't spend the money on the
association

01:07:55.670 --> 01:07:55.680 align:start position:0%
association
 
01:07:57.349 --> 01:07:57.359 align:start position:0%
most of this stuff has already been said
 
01:07:57.359 --> 01:07:59.190 align:start position:0%
most of this stuff has already been said
today

01:07:59.190 --> 01:07:59.200 align:start position:0%
today
 
01:08:00.309 --> 01:08:00.319 align:start position:0%
i don't like being last because
 
01:08:02.309 --> 01:08:02.319 align:start position:0%
everything else has been said so
 
01:08:02.319 --> 01:08:03.190 align:start position:0%
everything else has been said so
um

01:08:03.190 --> 01:08:03.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:07.510 --> 01:08:07.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:09.750 --> 01:08:09.760 align:start position:0%
northfield's a small town
 
01:08:11.349 --> 01:08:11.359 align:start position:0%

it's hard to uh to follow each bill
 
01:08:19.829 --> 01:08:19.839 align:start position:0%
um we use the new hampshire municipal
 
01:08:22.149 --> 01:08:22.159 align:start position:0%
association to help us with that and
 
01:08:25.669 --> 01:08:25.679 align:start position:0%

01:08:55.749 --> 01:08:55.759 align:start position:0%
smaller towns would more particularly be
 
01:08:57.590 --> 01:08:57.600 align:start position:0%
affected by this
 
01:08:59.829 --> 01:08:59.839 align:start position:0%
because they would have to figure out
 
01:09:01.110 --> 01:09:01.120 align:start position:0%
another way
 
01:09:03.189 --> 01:09:03.199 align:start position:0%
to get the information
 
01:09:05.829 --> 01:09:05.839 align:start position:0%
that larger towns or cities would be
 
01:09:07.990 --> 01:09:08.000 align:start position:0%
able to get because they have maybe
 
01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:09.349 align:start position:0%
able to get because they have maybe
financial

01:09:09.349 --> 01:09:09.359 align:start position:0%
financial
 
01:09:11.749 --> 01:09:11.759 align:start position:0%
means or donations or whatever it is
 
01:09:13.430 --> 01:09:13.440 align:start position:0%
that can come into them
 
01:09:15.910 --> 01:09:15.920 align:start position:0%
are you saying that in order for small
 
01:09:18.390 --> 01:09:18.400 align:start position:0%
towns to be able to understand what's
 
01:09:20.550 --> 01:09:20.560 align:start position:0%
going on at the state level they would
 
01:09:22.950 --> 01:09:22.960 align:start position:0%
have to hire somebody independently to
 
01:09:25.510 --> 01:09:25.520 align:start position:0%
do that where now they pull their funds
 
01:09:27.189 --> 01:09:27.199 align:start position:0%
and they have those funds
 
01:09:29.030 --> 01:09:29.040 align:start position:0%
distributed to individuals that are in
 
01:09:31.110 --> 01:09:31.120 align:start position:0%
fact lobbyists to provide information to
 
01:09:32.829 --> 01:09:32.839 align:start position:0%
them on how they should govern their
 
01:09:36.309 --> 01:09:36.319 align:start position:0%
towns that is that that's a good example
 
01:09:39.590 --> 01:09:39.600 align:start position:0%
and um i think that town of northfield i
 
01:09:41.189 --> 01:09:41.199 align:start position:0%
mean we have
 
01:09:43.189 --> 01:09:43.199 align:start position:0%
limited staff and it's getting harder
 
01:09:45.269 --> 01:09:45.279 align:start position:0%
and harder to fill our positions
 
01:09:45.279 --> 01:09:46.149 align:start position:0%
and harder to fill our positions
um

01:09:46.149 --> 01:09:46.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:09:47.669 --> 01:09:47.679 align:start position:0%
i think that
 
01:09:49.590 --> 01:09:49.600 align:start position:0%
the municipal association provides more
 
01:09:50.870 --> 01:09:50.880 align:start position:0%
than just lobbying they provide
 
01:09:52.550 --> 01:09:52.560 align:start position:0%
education they provide conferencing they
 
01:09:54.229 --> 01:09:54.239 align:start position:0%
provide training
 
01:09:54.239 --> 01:09:55.590 align:start position:0%
provide training
um

01:09:55.590 --> 01:09:55.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:09:56.950 --> 01:09:56.960 align:start position:0%
and so
 
01:09:59.189 --> 01:09:59.199 align:start position:0%
i i utilized that organization quite
 
01:09:59.199 --> 01:10:01.110 align:start position:0%
i i utilized that organization quite
frequently

01:10:01.110 --> 01:10:01.120 align:start position:0%
frequently
 
01:10:02.229 --> 01:10:02.239 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
01:10:04.709 --> 01:10:04.719 align:start position:0%
you know we have in my town
 
01:10:06.310 --> 01:10:06.320 align:start position:0%
um goffstown
 
01:10:08.149 --> 01:10:08.159 align:start position:0%
uh we have a lot of different volunteers
 
01:10:09.990 --> 01:10:10.000 align:start position:0%
and a lot of them are attorneys me
 
01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:11.030 align:start position:0%
and a lot of them are attorneys me
included

01:10:11.030 --> 01:10:11.040 align:start position:0%
included
 
01:10:14.870 --> 01:10:14.880 align:start position:0%
and we do volunteer our expertise and
 
01:10:18.310 --> 01:10:18.320 align:start position:0%
our time so i although i can appreciate
 
01:10:21.189 --> 01:10:21.199 align:start position:0%
that small towns may have to go out and
 
01:10:23.270 --> 01:10:23.280 align:start position:0%
hire people to help them
 
01:10:25.590 --> 01:10:25.600 align:start position:0%
um a lot of times there are volunteers
 
01:10:28.790 --> 01:10:28.800 align:start position:0%
that are able to do that so i i do
 
01:10:30.790 --> 01:10:30.800 align:start position:0%
understand what everybody is saying
 
01:10:32.550 --> 01:10:32.560 align:start position:0%
about pooling their funds and i can
 
01:10:35.189 --> 01:10:35.199 align:start position:0%
appreciate that but i just wonder if the
 
01:10:37.270 --> 01:10:37.280 align:start position:0%
small towns especially the borders the
 
01:10:39.990 --> 01:10:40.000 align:start position:0%
selectmen the group that you're um part
 
01:10:42.630 --> 01:10:42.640 align:start position:0%
of if they have actually thought about
 
01:10:44.709 --> 01:10:44.719 align:start position:0%
perhaps getting volunteers in their town
 
01:10:47.590 --> 01:10:47.600 align:start position:0%
to help them and advise on that
 
01:10:50.390 --> 01:10:50.400 align:start position:0%
um we currently have um
 
01:10:53.830 --> 01:10:53.840 align:start position:0%
openings on on all our boards
 
01:10:53.840 --> 01:10:54.790 align:start position:0%
openings on on all our boards
we

01:10:54.790 --> 01:10:54.800 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:10:56.470 --> 01:10:56.480 align:start position:0%
didn't have enough for a cip committee
 
01:10:58.709 --> 01:10:58.719 align:start position:0%
this year so you know volunteerism is
 
01:11:00.790 --> 01:11:00.800 align:start position:0%
not what it used to be
 
01:11:03.510 --> 01:11:03.520 align:start position:0%
in town northfield anyways true thank
 
01:11:03.520 --> 01:11:04.709 align:start position:0%
in town northfield anyways true thank
you

01:11:04.709 --> 01:11:04.719 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:11:06.550 --> 01:11:06.560 align:start position:0%
thank you any further questions
 
01:11:08.470 --> 01:11:08.480 align:start position:0%
representative simon
 
01:11:08.480 --> 01:11:09.430 align:start position:0%
representative simon
um

01:11:09.430 --> 01:11:09.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:11:11.910 --> 01:11:11.920 align:start position:0%
so i i realize that this information on
 
01:11:13.910 --> 01:11:13.920 align:start position:0%
the whole has to be um given to the
 
01:11:15.030 --> 01:11:15.040 align:start position:0%
secretary of state report to the
 
01:11:17.430 --> 01:11:17.440 align:start position:0%
secretary of state um but i would find
 
01:11:20.390 --> 01:11:20.400 align:start position:0%
it helpful to know if you know what your
 
01:11:23.669 --> 01:11:23.679 align:start position:0%
town pays the lobbying service for their
 
01:11:23.679 --> 01:11:24.630 align:start position:0%
town pays the lobbying service for their
service

01:11:24.630 --> 01:11:24.640 align:start position:0%
service
 
01:11:26.229 --> 01:11:26.239 align:start position:0%
a lot of the testimony is i think
 
01:11:27.990 --> 01:11:28.000 align:start position:0%
rightfully so that you know it's placing
 
01:11:29.430 --> 01:11:29.440 align:start position:0%
a burden on small towns that makes it
 
01:11:31.590 --> 01:11:31.600 align:start position:0%
difficult and it would be helpful to
 
01:11:31.600 --> 01:11:32.390 align:start position:0%
difficult and it would be helpful to
know

01:11:32.390 --> 01:11:32.400 align:start position:0%
know
 
01:11:33.669 --> 01:11:33.679 align:start position:0%
financially what kind of numbers we're
 
01:11:35.030 --> 01:11:35.040 align:start position:0%
looking at how much does it cost you for
 
01:11:36.390 --> 01:11:36.400 align:start position:0%
that service you know
 
01:11:37.430 --> 01:11:37.440 align:start position:0%
for the new hampshire municipal
 
01:11:39.750 --> 01:11:39.760 align:start position:0%
association it's about 5 000 a year
 
01:11:42.950 --> 01:11:42.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:45.189 --> 01:11:45.199 align:start position:0%
no further questions i have one
 
01:11:48.470 --> 01:11:48.480 align:start position:0%
um does northfield i say this as a
 
01:11:50.630 --> 01:11:50.640 align:start position:0%
resident of northfield
 
01:11:53.270 --> 01:11:53.280 align:start position:0%
does northfield have
 
01:11:55.830 --> 01:11:55.840 align:start position:0%
sources of income that are not
 
01:12:01.110 --> 01:12:01.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:02.870 --> 01:12:02.880 align:start position:0%
um as i was
 
01:12:04.149 --> 01:12:04.159 align:start position:0%
i was sitting here listening and trying
 
01:12:06.830 --> 01:12:06.840 align:start position:0%
to think and i can't think of any really
 
01:12:06.840 --> 01:12:08.390 align:start position:0%
to think and i can't think of any really
um

01:12:08.390 --> 01:12:08.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:12:09.990 --> 01:12:10.000 align:start position:0%
i mean we
 
01:12:13.910 --> 01:12:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:17.910 --> 01:12:17.920 align:start position:0%
there are there are uh funds that um
 
01:12:20.310 --> 01:12:20.320 align:start position:0%
other towns have mentioned in the past
 
01:12:23.350 --> 01:12:23.360 align:start position:0%
that come from
 
01:12:27.669 --> 01:12:27.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:28.950 --> 01:12:28.960 align:start position:0%
even from
 
01:12:31.189 --> 01:12:31.199 align:start position:0%
interest income that comes from cemetery
 
01:12:33.590 --> 01:12:33.600 align:start position:0%
fund anything like that it's my
 
01:12:35.990 --> 01:12:36.000 align:start position:0%
understanding and i'm i'm wondering if
 
01:12:38.470 --> 01:12:38.480 align:start position:0%
it's your understanding if that money by
 
01:12:41.270 --> 01:12:41.280 align:start position:0%
definition from this law if this were to
 
01:12:41.280 --> 01:12:42.229 align:start position:0%
definition from this law if this were to
pass

01:12:42.229 --> 01:12:42.239 align:start position:0%
pass
 
01:12:44.790 --> 01:12:44.800 align:start position:0%
that money could be placed into a
 
01:12:44.800 --> 01:12:46.709 align:start position:0%
that money could be placed into a
separate

01:12:46.709 --> 01:12:46.719 align:start position:0%
separate
 
01:12:49.189 --> 01:12:49.199 align:start position:0%
distinct checking account and that money
 
01:12:50.550 --> 01:12:50.560 align:start position:0%
could provide
 
01:12:53.030 --> 01:12:53.040 align:start position:0%
the five thousand dollars that uh was
 
01:12:54.310 --> 01:12:54.320 align:start position:0%
just stated
 
01:12:54.320 --> 01:12:55.430 align:start position:0%
just stated
as

01:12:55.430 --> 01:12:55.440 align:start position:0%
as
 
01:12:58.790 --> 01:12:58.800 align:start position:0%
the dues for a municipal association
 
01:13:01.510 --> 01:13:01.520 align:start position:0%
and and none of this would then apply
 
01:13:04.550 --> 01:13:04.560 align:start position:0%
everything would stay the same or
 
01:13:06.070 --> 01:13:06.080 align:start position:0%
and i'm not sure if
 
01:13:07.750 --> 01:13:07.760 align:start position:0%
maybe you know if
 
01:13:09.510 --> 01:13:09.520 align:start position:0%
if new hampshire and i should have asked
 
01:13:11.270 --> 01:13:11.280 align:start position:0%
new hampshire municipal association
 
01:13:11.280 --> 01:13:12.630 align:start position:0%
new hampshire municipal association
representative

01:13:12.630 --> 01:13:12.640 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:13:15.350 --> 01:13:15.360 align:start position:0%
or executive director if
 
01:13:18.550 --> 01:13:18.560 align:start position:0%
if there is a line item for lobbying so
 
01:13:21.430 --> 01:13:21.440 align:start position:0%
that a town could purchase
 
01:13:23.110 --> 01:13:23.120 align:start position:0%
all of the other services that you
 
01:13:25.910 --> 01:13:25.920 align:start position:0%
mentioned that northfield uses other
 
01:13:29.270 --> 01:13:29.280 align:start position:0%
than lobbying i don't know if that's
 
01:13:32.630 --> 01:13:32.640 align:start position:0%
an option but but i'm wondering if
 
01:13:34.149 --> 01:13:34.159 align:start position:0%
if there is a way
 
01:13:36.790 --> 01:13:36.800 align:start position:0%
that you could work with this law by
 
01:13:39.189 --> 01:13:39.199 align:start position:0%
segregating those funds that came from
 
01:13:42.310 --> 01:13:42.320 align:start position:0%
other sources other than direct taxation
 
01:13:43.430 --> 01:13:43.440 align:start position:0%
um i don't want to answer for the
 
01:13:45.669 --> 01:13:45.679 align:start position:0%
association so i'm not gonna answer that
 
01:13:47.910 --> 01:13:47.920 align:start position:0%
other question um but as far as our fees
 
01:13:50.790 --> 01:13:50.800 align:start position:0%
you know it's very small i mean interest
 
01:13:52.950 --> 01:13:52.960 align:start position:0%
on on our checking accounts you know ten
 
01:13:55.030 --> 01:13:55.040 align:start position:0%
dollars i mean so it's not a lot of
 
01:13:55.040 --> 01:13:55.990 align:start position:0%
dollars i mean so it's not a lot of
money

01:13:55.990 --> 01:13:56.000 align:start position:0%
money
 
01:13:58.709 --> 01:13:58.719 align:start position:0%
uh most of our most of our income is you
 
01:14:01.430 --> 01:14:01.440 align:start position:0%
know driven by taxes so
 
01:14:06.390 --> 01:14:06.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:06.400 --> 01:14:07.350 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

01:14:07.350 --> 01:14:07.360 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:14:08.950 --> 01:14:08.960 align:start position:0%
i'm going to follow up on something our
 
01:14:10.950 --> 01:14:10.960 align:start position:0%
here just asked you he talked about a
 
01:14:12.870 --> 01:14:12.880 align:start position:0%
little bit about lobbying and what was
 
01:14:14.630 --> 01:14:14.640 align:start position:0%
paid and whether there was a line item
 
01:14:16.709 --> 01:14:16.719 align:start position:0%
for that with regard to the new
 
01:14:18.950 --> 01:14:18.960 align:start position:0%
hampshire municipal association
 
01:14:20.870 --> 01:14:20.880 align:start position:0%
you pay them about five thousand dollars
 
01:14:22.149 --> 01:14:22.159 align:start position:0%
a year
 
01:14:24.310 --> 01:14:24.320 align:start position:0%
for their services does that also
 
01:14:28.630 --> 01:14:28.640 align:start position:0%
include individual legal services to
 
01:14:31.270 --> 01:14:31.280 align:start position:0%
you versus lobbying
 
01:14:32.870 --> 01:14:32.880 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i don't follow your question
 
01:14:34.310 --> 01:14:34.320 align:start position:0%
the money that you pay new hampshire
 
01:14:36.310 --> 01:14:36.320 align:start position:0%
municipal association like five thousand
 
01:14:37.510 --> 01:14:37.520 align:start position:0%
give or take
 
01:14:40.149 --> 01:14:40.159 align:start position:0%
is that five thousand solely for

01:15:38.630 --> 01:15:38.640 align:start position:0%
sort of their counterpart on the uh on
 
01:15:40.310 --> 01:15:40.320 align:start position:0%
the school side we're a voluntary
 
01:15:43.189 --> 01:15:43.199 align:start position:0%
organization we have about 161
 
01:15:45.350 --> 01:15:45.360 align:start position:0%
school boards that pay dues across the
 
01:15:47.350 --> 01:15:47.360 align:start position:0%
uh from across the state that pay dues
 
01:15:49.110 --> 01:15:49.120 align:start position:0%
to nhsba
 
01:15:51.830 --> 01:15:51.840 align:start position:0%
i don't have a lot to add i think most
 
01:15:53.270 --> 01:15:53.280 align:start position:0%
of my testimonies are already been
 
01:15:55.830 --> 01:15:55.840 align:start position:0%
covered by the by the previous speakers
 
01:15:58.229 --> 01:15:58.239 align:start position:0%
um just a couple points that i that i do
 
01:16:01.110 --> 01:16:01.120 align:start position:0%
would would like to make though um i did
 
01:16:04.310 --> 01:16:04.320 align:start position:0%
some legislative history of rsa 15 5 in
 
01:16:05.910 --> 01:16:05.920 align:start position:0%
its current form i believe it was from
 
01:16:08.790 --> 01:16:08.800 align:start position:0%
2006 when the current iteration of this
 
01:16:11.110 --> 01:16:11.120 align:start position:0%
bill um
 
01:16:13.189 --> 01:16:13.199 align:start position:0%
ran through the legislative process the
 
01:16:15.510 --> 01:16:15.520 align:start position:0%
legislative history is is not helpful
 
01:16:17.590 --> 01:16:17.600 align:start position:0%
it's not conclusive by any means this
 
01:16:20.470 --> 01:16:20.480 align:start position:0%
language in rsa 15 5. seems to be
 
01:16:23.110 --> 01:16:23.120 align:start position:0%
included in a very comprehensive bill
 
01:16:26.149 --> 01:16:26.159 align:start position:0%
that i think started out with like um
 
01:16:30.550 --> 01:16:30.560 align:start position:0%
ethical standards for the um the um
 
01:16:32.390 --> 01:16:32.400 align:start position:0%
the governor's branch of office or the
 
01:16:34.149 --> 01:16:34.159 align:start position:0%
governor's office things of that nature
 
01:16:36.950 --> 01:16:36.960 align:start position:0%
so that's not very instructive but um i
 
01:16:38.790 --> 01:16:38.800 align:start position:0%
think it isn't instructed for what the
 
01:16:41.110 --> 01:16:41.120 align:start position:0%
intent of the statute really is intended
 
01:16:42.870 --> 01:16:42.880 align:start position:0%
to mean though but i think it is helpful
 
01:16:45.030 --> 01:16:45.040 align:start position:0%
that when this statute became law in
 
01:16:45.040 --> 01:16:46.709 align:start position:0%
that when this statute became law in
2006

01:16:46.709 --> 01:16:46.719 align:start position:0%
2006
 
01:16:49.189 --> 01:16:49.199 align:start position:0%
organizations such as nhma and the
 
01:16:50.870 --> 01:16:50.880 align:start position:0%
school boards association the counties
 
01:16:50.880 --> 01:16:52.630 align:start position:0%
school boards association the counties
association

01:16:52.630 --> 01:16:52.640 align:start position:0%
association
 
01:16:55.030 --> 01:16:55.040 align:start position:0%
we were not tracked as being followed
 
01:16:56.709 --> 01:16:56.719 align:start position:0%
under this law i think if the intent of
 
01:16:59.510 --> 01:16:59.520 align:start position:0%
this law was to include or nonprofit
 
01:17:01.910 --> 01:17:01.920 align:start position:0%
organizations such as nhsba the
 
01:17:03.430 --> 01:17:03.440 align:start position:0%
municipal association some of the other
 
01:17:05.590 --> 01:17:05.600 align:start position:0%
associations whoever put that language
 
01:17:07.350 --> 01:17:07.360 align:start position:0%
in the bill would have been on top of
 
01:17:09.110 --> 01:17:09.120 align:start position:0%
these sorts of associations to make sure
 
01:17:10.550 --> 01:17:10.560 align:start position:0%
that we were following these provisions
 
01:17:12.470 --> 01:17:12.480 align:start position:0%
in terms of segregating funds and things
 
01:17:14.310 --> 01:17:14.320 align:start position:0%
of that nature
 
01:17:15.830 --> 01:17:15.840 align:start position:0%
the other aspect that i would like to
 
01:17:18.630 --> 01:17:18.640 align:start position:0%
make as well too and i believe ms burns
 
01:17:19.750 --> 01:17:19.760 align:start position:0%
made this
 
01:17:23.430 --> 01:17:23.440 align:start position:0%
we have to be very mindful um that
 
01:17:26.310 --> 01:17:26.320 align:start position:0%
public bodies engage with
 
01:17:28.870 --> 01:17:28.880 align:start position:0%
for-profit businesses
 
01:17:31.669 --> 01:17:31.679 align:start position:0%
trash removal electrical services
 
01:17:34.470 --> 01:17:34.480 align:start position:0%
internet uh it's my assumption that some
 
01:17:36.310 --> 01:17:36.320 align:start position:0%
of those organs though some of those
 
01:17:38.229 --> 01:17:38.239 align:start position:0%
private companies also engage in
 
01:17:39.990 --> 01:17:40.000 align:start position:0%
lobbying so
 
01:17:43.110 --> 01:17:43.120 align:start position:0%
what percentage of of of your cable bill
 
01:17:45.510 --> 01:17:45.520 align:start position:0%
or your electric bill that you're paying
 
01:17:47.990 --> 01:17:48.000 align:start position:0%
to a company is being used for lobbying
 
01:17:49.510 --> 01:17:49.520 align:start position:0%
services in front of this body when
 
01:17:50.870 --> 01:17:50.880 align:start position:0%
you're paying that bill with public
 
01:17:52.550 --> 01:17:52.560 align:start position:0%
money i think would also be very
 
01:17:52.560 --> 01:17:54.310 align:start position:0%
money i think would also be very
confusing

01:17:54.310 --> 01:17:54.320 align:start position:0%
confusing
 
01:17:56.630 --> 01:17:56.640 align:start position:0%
uh relative to um
 
01:18:00.070 --> 01:18:00.080 align:start position:0%
sort of the the sharing of services and
 
01:18:02.630 --> 01:18:02.640 align:start position:0%
and and having uh individual public
 
01:18:04.229 --> 01:18:04.239 align:start position:0%
bodies be able to have a voice here at
 
01:18:07.030 --> 01:18:07.040 align:start position:0%
the legislature there are currently 100
 
01:18:10.310 --> 01:18:10.320 align:start position:0%
bills in house education alone um it
 
01:18:12.870 --> 01:18:12.880 align:start position:0%
would be unreasonable to ask school
 
01:18:15.110 --> 01:18:15.120 align:start position:0%
board members to
 
01:18:17.350 --> 01:18:17.360 align:start position:0%
find time to come down to speak on every
 
01:18:17.360 --> 01:18:18.390 align:start position:0%
find time to come down to speak on every
bill

01:18:18.390 --> 01:18:18.400 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:18:20.390 --> 01:18:20.400 align:start position:0%
to have the expertise or knowledge to
 
01:18:22.229 --> 01:18:22.239 align:start position:0%
speak on every bill
 
01:18:23.830 --> 01:18:23.840 align:start position:0%
how many times do we have a bill
 
01:18:26.550 --> 01:18:26.560 align:start position:0%
scheduled at 10 30 and it's noon before
 
01:18:28.709 --> 01:18:28.719 align:start position:0%
we finally get to it these are people
 
01:18:31.430 --> 01:18:31.440 align:start position:0%
with jobs and families and kids and
 
01:18:33.270 --> 01:18:33.280 align:start position:0%
child care and all those sort of all
 
01:18:35.990 --> 01:18:36.000 align:start position:0%
those other issues so it
 
01:18:37.750 --> 01:18:37.760 align:start position:0%
makes sense to pay a professional
 
01:18:39.750 --> 01:18:39.760 align:start position:0%
organization who has the background and
 
01:18:42.790 --> 01:18:42.800 align:start position:0%
information and knowledge and history
 
01:18:45.590 --> 01:18:45.600 align:start position:0%
and expertise to be able to speak to the
 
01:18:45.600 --> 01:18:47.110 align:start position:0%
and expertise to be able to speak to the
legislature

01:18:47.110 --> 01:18:47.120 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
01:18:49.350 --> 01:18:49.360 align:start position:0%
on the on on behalf of the public body
 
01:18:51.270 --> 01:18:51.280 align:start position:0%
or on behalf of a certain entity or
 
01:18:51.280 --> 01:18:53.430 align:start position:0%
or on behalf of a certain entity or
organization

01:18:53.430 --> 01:18:53.440 align:start position:0%
organization
 
01:18:55.750 --> 01:18:55.760 align:start position:0%
i think those are all the the questions
 
01:18:57.430 --> 01:18:57.440 align:start position:0%
i have um to address some of the
 
01:19:00.390 --> 01:19:00.400 align:start position:0%
questions um that this body may have had
 
01:19:02.950 --> 01:19:02.960 align:start position:0%
representative roulard i believe you
 
01:19:05.270 --> 01:19:05.280 align:start position:0%
asked the individual from from
 
01:19:08.149 --> 01:19:08.159 align:start position:0%
northfield about the dues to nhma and
 
01:19:10.390 --> 01:19:10.400 align:start position:0%
how much of those dues are particularly
 
01:19:13.590 --> 01:19:13.600 align:start position:0%
used for quote unquote lobbying um
 
01:19:16.870 --> 01:19:16.880 align:start position:0%
so again a school board will pay nhsba
 
01:19:19.030 --> 01:19:19.040 align:start position:0%
a certain a certain fee and just for
 
01:19:20.470 --> 01:19:20.480 align:start position:0%
your own background
 
01:19:22.870 --> 01:19:22.880 align:start position:0%
high is manchester their dues are about
 
01:19:25.990 --> 01:19:26.000 align:start position:0%
7 200 hours per year and our low is
 
01:19:28.709 --> 01:19:28.719 align:start position:0%
probably 800 to 1 000 a year for maybe
 
01:19:30.790 --> 01:19:30.800 align:start position:0%
like waterville valley or ellsworth with
 
01:19:33.030 --> 01:19:33.040 align:start position:0%
with very few students just to give you
 
01:19:34.149 --> 01:19:34.159 align:start position:0%
a range
 
01:19:36.470 --> 01:19:36.480 align:start position:0%
um so the dues
 
01:19:39.750 --> 01:19:39.760 align:start position:0%
don't pay for lobbying per se it's
 
01:19:42.950 --> 01:19:42.960 align:start position:0%
bundled packages we provide
 
01:19:44.870 --> 01:19:44.880 align:start position:0%
legal advice we have a staff attorney
 
01:19:46.709 --> 01:19:46.719 align:start position:0%
who answers legal questions from school
 
01:19:48.390 --> 01:19:48.400 align:start position:0%
board members and superintendents all
 
01:19:51.030 --> 01:19:51.040 align:start position:0%
day works with policy policy work right
 
01:19:53.030 --> 01:19:53.040 align:start position:0%
to no law questions things of that
 
01:19:53.040 --> 01:19:54.070 align:start position:0%
to no law questions things of that
nature

01:19:54.070 --> 01:19:54.080 align:start position:0%
nature
 
01:19:57.189 --> 01:19:57.199 align:start position:0%
um we uh um other services that we
 
01:20:00.229 --> 01:20:00.239 align:start position:0%
provide trainings um we do probably 12
 
01:20:03.270 --> 01:20:03.280 align:start position:0%
to 15 webinars a year and then we do
 
01:20:06.070 --> 01:20:06.080 align:start position:0%
probably 50 to 80 individual trainings
 
01:20:07.830 --> 01:20:07.840 align:start position:0%
every year where myself or my staff
 
01:20:09.830 --> 01:20:09.840 align:start position:0%
attorney will visit a local school
 
01:20:11.910 --> 01:20:11.920 align:start position:0%
district and do a training on roles and
 
01:20:13.669 --> 01:20:13.679 align:start position:0%
responsibilities right to no law
 
01:20:15.910 --> 01:20:15.920 align:start position:0%
collective bargaining budget process
 
01:20:18.950 --> 01:20:18.960 align:start position:0%
evaluating your superintendent and then
 
01:20:21.189 --> 01:20:21.199 align:start position:0%
you know there is a portion that is used
 
01:20:23.110 --> 01:20:23.120 align:start position:0%
for lobbying we do report to the
 
01:20:25.830 --> 01:20:25.840 align:start position:0%
secretary of state on a quarterly basis
 
01:20:28.149 --> 01:20:28.159 align:start position:0%
um i will tell you um
 
01:20:31.590 --> 01:20:31.600 align:start position:0%
organization wide our lobbying efforts
 
01:20:33.430 --> 01:20:33.440 align:start position:0%
come in anywhere between about five to
 
01:20:35.750 --> 01:20:35.760 align:start position:0%
seven percent of our total operating
 
01:20:37.590 --> 01:20:37.600 align:start position:0%
budget in any given year depending on
 
01:20:39.030 --> 01:20:39.040 align:start position:0%
the number of bills
 
01:20:41.030 --> 01:20:41.040 align:start position:0%
that's going to fluctuate this year it's
 
01:20:42.470 --> 01:20:42.480 align:start position:0%
going to be higher because as i said
 
01:20:43.910 --> 01:20:43.920 align:start position:0%
there are already 100 bills in house
 
01:20:47.590 --> 01:20:47.600 align:start position:0%
education that nhsba is is tracking um

labor relations act to employees of the
 
01:22:37.510 --> 01:22:37.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:39.669 --> 01:22:39.679 align:start position:0%
i did provide a handout it's more of a
 
01:22:40.790 --> 01:22:40.800 align:start position:0%
summary of
 
01:22:41.990 --> 01:22:42.000 align:start position:0%
certain things that have happened over
 
01:22:43.270 --> 01:22:43.280 align:start position:0%
the years
 
01:22:46.229 --> 01:22:46.239 align:start position:0%
and to basically uh state what this bill
 
01:22:49.030 --> 01:22:49.040 align:start position:0%
who would cover
 
01:22:51.189 --> 01:22:51.199 align:start position:0%
the bill establishes a legislature as a
 
01:22:52.950 --> 01:22:52.960 align:start position:0%
public employer under the public
 
01:22:52.960 --> 01:22:53.990 align:start position:0%
public employer under the public
employee

01:22:53.990 --> 01:22:54.000 align:start position:0%
employee
 
01:22:56.470 --> 01:22:56.480 align:start position:0%
labor relations act and establishes
 
01:22:58.790 --> 01:22:58.800 align:start position:0%
procedures for collective bargaining by
 
01:23:01.510 --> 01:23:01.520 align:start position:0%
nonpartisan employees
 
01:23:03.590 --> 01:23:03.600 align:start position:0%
the legislature would join the judicial
 
01:23:05.750 --> 01:23:05.760 align:start position:0%
branch and other state agencies which
 
01:23:08.629 --> 01:23:08.639 align:start position:0%
already have in place a working program
 
01:23:11.430 --> 01:23:11.440 align:start position:0%
as public employees under the public
 
01:23:14.629 --> 01:23:14.639 align:start position:0%
employee labor relations act
 
01:23:17.030 --> 01:23:17.040 align:start position:0%
this arrangement has worked well
 
01:23:18.830 --> 01:23:18.840 align:start position:0%
in these other government
 
01:23:22.149 --> 01:23:22.159 align:start position:0%
entities employees are given the choice
 
01:23:24.950 --> 01:23:24.960 align:start position:0%
as to whether or not to form a union
 
01:23:24.960 --> 01:23:26.149 align:start position:0%
as to whether or not to form a union
basically

01:23:26.149 --> 01:23:26.159 align:start position:0%
basically
 
01:23:28.790 --> 01:23:28.800 align:start position:0%
existing job action and striking laws
 
01:23:30.790 --> 01:23:30.800 align:start position:0%
would apply as they do now
 
01:23:33.350 --> 01:23:33.360 align:start position:0%
to the other groups that already have
 
01:23:35.990 --> 01:23:36.000 align:start position:0%
had this right
 
01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:37.830 align:start position:0%
had this right
uh

01:23:37.830 --> 01:23:37.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:23:39.590 --> 01:23:39.600 align:start position:0%
the following is a brief history of some
 
01:23:41.510 --> 01:23:41.520 align:start position:0%
of the similar past builds i put it in
 
01:23:43.910 --> 01:23:43.920 align:start position:0%
here because this obviously has been in
 
01:23:46.149 --> 01:23:46.159 align:start position:0%
front of this this committee met many
 
01:23:47.750 --> 01:23:47.760 align:start position:0%
times and many of you wherever and many
 
01:23:51.189 --> 01:23:51.199 align:start position:0%
of you have voted on this before
 
01:23:51.199 --> 01:23:53.189 align:start position:0%
of you have voted on this before
um

01:23:53.189 --> 01:23:53.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:23:54.950 --> 01:23:54.960 align:start position:0%
i won't go into a lot of details with
 
01:23:56.550 --> 01:23:56.560 align:start position:0%
them but basically there were five bills
 
01:23:58.310 --> 01:23:58.320 align:start position:0%
that i could find before this you go
 
01:23:59.910 --> 01:23:59.920 align:start position:0%
back any further and the computer
 
01:24:01.350 --> 01:24:01.360 align:start position:0%
doesn't tell you
 
01:24:03.030 --> 01:24:03.040 align:start position:0%
give you the information if there are
 
01:24:04.950 --> 01:24:04.960 align:start position:0%
any it's interested in trying to use
 
01:24:06.950 --> 01:24:06.960 align:start position:0%
that sometimes
 
01:24:08.149 --> 01:24:08.159 align:start position:0%
but the
 
01:24:10.229 --> 01:24:10.239 align:start position:0%
you know starting out in uh
 
01:24:12.629 --> 01:24:12.639 align:start position:0%
in 1998
 
01:24:16.470 --> 01:24:16.480 align:start position:0%
there was a hb you know 1405.
 
01:24:16.480 --> 01:24:18.070 align:start position:0%
there was a hb you know 1405.
um

01:24:18.070 --> 01:24:18.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:24:19.629 --> 01:24:19.639 align:start position:0%
and then in
 
01:24:19.639 --> 01:24:21.430 align:start position:0%
and then in
2016

01:24:21.430 --> 01:24:21.440 align:start position:0%
2016
 
01:24:26.070 --> 01:24:26.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:28.790 --> 01:24:28.800 align:start position:0%
then at 18 it was hb
 
01:24:28.800 --> 01:24:31.990 align:start position:0%
then at 18 it was hb
1301

01:24:31.990 --> 01:24:32.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:38.070 --> 01:24:38.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:39.590 --> 01:24:39.600 align:start position:0%
and then
 
01:24:42.229 --> 01:24:42.239 align:start position:0%
just right here in uh depending on which
 
01:24:44.390 --> 01:24:44.400 align:start position:0%
teacher used
 
01:24:49.510 --> 01:24:49.520 align:start position:0%
in in 20 finally there was hb 363.
 
01:24:49.520 --> 01:24:50.950 align:start position:0%
in in 20 finally there was hb 363.
um

01:24:50.950 --> 01:24:50.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:24:53.350 --> 01:24:53.360 align:start position:0%
now i think one point of when you lay
 
01:24:54.950 --> 01:24:54.960 align:start position:0%
these builds out and look at them all at
 
01:24:54.960 --> 01:24:57.510 align:start position:0%
these builds out and look at them all at
once

01:24:57.510 --> 01:24:57.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:01.990 --> 01:25:02.000 align:start position:0%
if uh in sb 249
 
01:25:04.790 --> 01:25:04.800 align:start position:0%
uh the senate passed it
 
01:25:06.390 --> 01:25:06.400 align:start position:0%
in uh
 
01:25:09.030 --> 01:25:09.040 align:start position:0%
hb 363
 
01:25:10.790 --> 01:25:10.800 align:start position:0%
uh the house passed it
 
01:25:12.070 --> 01:25:12.080 align:start position:0%
now if we just could have got them
 
01:25:14.149 --> 01:25:14.159 align:start position:0%
together at the same time
 
01:25:16.229 --> 01:25:16.239 align:start position:0%
we we wouldn't be here discussing this
 
01:25:17.350 --> 01:25:17.360 align:start position:0%
right now
 
01:25:19.270 --> 01:25:19.280 align:start position:0%
it would have already passed
 
01:25:20.790 --> 01:25:20.800 align:start position:0%
but it didn't so that that's why i'm
 
01:25:20.800 --> 01:25:22.310 align:start position:0%
but it didn't so that that's why i'm
here

01:25:22.310 --> 01:25:22.320 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:25:22.320 --> 01:25:23.189 align:start position:0%
here
um

01:25:23.189 --> 01:25:23.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:25:24.790 --> 01:25:24.800 align:start position:0%
and of course this is the bill you know
 
01:25:24.800 --> 01:25:25.510 align:start position:0%
and of course this is the bill you know
the

01:25:25.510 --> 01:25:25.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:25:28.070 --> 01:25:28.080 align:start position:0%
hb 1041 which is which is here now and
 
01:25:30.709 --> 01:25:30.719 align:start position:0%
why i'm talking
 
01:25:30.719 --> 01:25:32.149 align:start position:0%
why i'm talking
but

01:25:32.149 --> 01:25:32.159 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:25:33.990 --> 01:25:34.000 align:start position:0%
almost in summary uh
 
01:25:35.510 --> 01:25:35.520 align:start position:0%
one of the big things is is to mention
 
01:25:38.070 --> 01:25:38.080 align:start position:0%
what a non-partisan employee means and
 
01:25:40.390 --> 01:25:40.400 align:start position:0%
who this would affect it means an
 
01:25:42.790 --> 01:25:42.800 align:start position:0%
employee whose purpose is to serve
 
01:25:45.030 --> 01:25:45.040 align:start position:0%
the institution of the general court
 
01:25:46.550 --> 01:25:46.560 align:start position:0%
rather than to shape or implement
 
01:25:49.189 --> 01:25:49.199 align:start position:0%

01:25:51.110 --> 01:25:51.120 align:start position:0%

01:26:50.470 --> 01:26:50.480 align:start position:0%
surprised when i read through it again
 
01:26:52.709 --> 01:26:52.719 align:start position:0%
and how long it took to read it
 
01:26:53.910 --> 01:26:53.920 align:start position:0%
but the
 
01:26:55.669 --> 01:26:55.679 align:start position:0%
main thing i'd like to say is please
 
01:26:57.350 --> 01:26:57.360 align:start position:0%

on this handout that you gave us
 
01:27:27.669 --> 01:27:27.679 align:start position:0%
expressed a need or an interest in

forming a union
 
01:27:31.669 --> 01:27:31.679 align:start position:0%
i would have to say that i haven't done
 
01:27:33.189 --> 01:27:33.199 align:start position:0%
a comprehensive list especially not
 
01:27:34.870 --> 01:27:34.880 align:start position:0%
knowing that all these all these groups
 
01:27:37.430 --> 01:27:37.440 align:start position:0%
actually uh you know the bill would be
 
01:27:39.669 --> 01:27:39.679 align:start position:0%
against them or affect them i have
 
01:27:41.510 --> 01:27:41.520 align:start position:0%
talked to a couple people and and they
 
01:27:43.669 --> 01:27:43.679 align:start position:0%
obviously are interested in this but
 
01:27:45.910 --> 01:27:45.920 align:start position:0%
um i'm sure that they were like other
 
01:27:47.669 --> 01:27:47.679 align:start position:0%
things there would be some that
 
01:27:49.590 --> 01:27:49.600 align:start position:0%
there wouldn't be but that's
 
01:27:51.110 --> 01:27:51.120 align:start position:0%
the whole thing is to give them the
 
01:27:54.229 --> 01:27:54.239 align:start position:0%
opportunity to make a choice
 
01:27:55.350 --> 01:27:55.360 align:start position:0%

welcome to the legislative
 
01:31:02.870 --> 01:31:02.880 align:start position:0%
administration thank you mr chair and
 
01:31:04.470 --> 01:31:04.480 align:start position:0%
again thank you honorable members of the
 
01:31:06.310 --> 01:31:06.320 align:start position:0%
committee for welcoming me
 
01:31:08.790 --> 01:31:08.800 align:start position:0%
um so i think this is going to be like
 
01:31:11.270 --> 01:31:11.280 align:start position:0%
the funnest one today because i'm pretty
 
01:31:12.470 --> 01:31:12.480 align:start position:0%
sure it's the only one where the prime
 
01:31:14.470 --> 01:31:14.480 align:start position:0%
sponsor is going to say you can i t all
 
01:31:16.870 --> 01:31:16.880 align:start position:0%
this with my blessing
 
01:31:19.910 --> 01:31:19.920 align:start position:0%
so the history of this is that right
 
01:31:22.790 --> 01:31:22.800 align:start position:0%
after i got elected in 2017 i had 30 40
 
01:31:25.030 --> 01:31:25.040 align:start position:0%
people who wanted to support me and get
 
01:31:27.669 --> 01:31:27.679 align:start position:0%
active on bills and i had to tell them
 
01:31:29.910 --> 01:31:29.920 align:start position:0%
you have to go check the website on
 
01:31:31.990 --> 01:31:32.000 align:start position:0%
thursdays after the house calendar is
 
01:31:34.070 --> 01:31:34.080 align:start position:0%
available and you have to remember to do
 
01:31:35.990 --> 01:31:36.000 align:start position:0%
this and if you forget until say sunday
 
01:31:37.990 --> 01:31:38.000 align:start position:0%
night or monday it might sneak up on you
 
01:31:40.149 --> 01:31:40.159 align:start position:0%
and you might have a hearing on tuesday
 
01:31:41.669 --> 01:31:41.679 align:start position:0%
bills that you care about and you know
 
01:31:45.030 --> 01:31:45.040 align:start position:0%
people have kids and football games and
 
01:31:46.709 --> 01:31:46.719 align:start position:0%
barbecues or whatever and i felt like it
 
01:31:48.870 --> 01:31:48.880 align:start position:0%
was really unfair that while we
 
01:31:51.270 --> 01:31:51.280 align:start position:0%
legislators get emails whenever that
 
01:31:52.790 --> 01:31:52.800 align:start position:0%
house calendar comes out so we can
 
01:31:54.790 --> 01:31:54.800 align:start position:0%
immediately go oh yes i need to check i
 
01:31:57.030 --> 01:31:57.040 align:start position:0%
need to see if my bills are up
 
01:31:59.110 --> 01:31:59.120 align:start position:0%
the the public doesn't the public you
 
01:32:01.830 --> 01:32:01.840 align:start position:0%
know can understandably be allowed to
 
01:32:04.229 --> 01:32:04.239 align:start position:0%
have more of a life outside this this
 
01:32:06.229 --> 01:32:06.239 align:start position:0%
building than we are so i felt like this
 
01:32:08.550 --> 01:32:08.560 align:start position:0%
is a very simple uh thing
 
01:32:10.149 --> 01:32:10.159 align:start position:0%
i uh
 
01:32:11.910 --> 01:32:11.920 align:start position:0%
i have worked in non-profits and it was
 
01:32:14.149 --> 01:32:14.159 align:start position:0%
a matter of in the system which is not
 
01:32:15.189 --> 01:32:15.199 align:start position:0%
the state house system but in the
 
01:32:16.629 --> 01:32:16.639 align:start position:0%
systems i've worked in at non-profits
 
01:32:18.470 --> 01:32:18.480 align:start position:0%
it's a five-minute thing to just put up
 
01:32:20.870 --> 01:32:20.880 align:start position:0%
a subscription field so people can put
 
01:32:22.950 --> 01:32:22.960 align:start position:0%
their email address in and automatically
 
01:32:24.229 --> 01:32:24.239 align:start position:0%
receive newsletters you may have seen
 
01:32:25.430 --> 01:32:25.440 align:start position:0%
this on
 
01:32:27.590 --> 01:32:27.600 align:start position:0%
dunkin donuts website or you know the
 
01:32:29.430 --> 01:32:29.440 align:start position:0%
red cross website or you name it very
 
01:32:31.430 --> 01:32:31.440 align:start position:0%
very easy you don't collect any personal
 
01:32:33.270 --> 01:32:33.280 align:start position:0%
identifiable information
 
01:32:35.750 --> 01:32:35.760 align:start position:0%
it's very it's self uh maintained and
 
01:32:37.189 --> 01:32:37.199 align:start position:0%
that people add themselves and they
 
01:32:40.070 --> 01:32:40.080 align:start position:0%
unsubscribe themselves extremely easy no
 
01:32:42.709 --> 01:32:42.719 align:start position:0%
money no manpower required
 
01:32:42.719 --> 01:32:43.510 align:start position:0%
money no manpower required
so

01:32:43.510 --> 01:32:43.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:32:45.350 --> 01:32:45.360 align:start position:0%
i went to the technical department that
 
01:32:47.990 --> 01:32:48.000 align:start position:0%
day in 2017 and i said hey can we please
 
01:32:49.910 --> 01:32:49.920 align:start position:0%
do this it's a really easy thing scott
 
01:32:52.070 --> 01:32:52.080 align:start position:0%
roop who was the director agreed with me
 
01:32:54.149 --> 01:32:54.159 align:start position:0%
but he said well it's actually because
 
01:32:55.510 --> 01:32:55.520 align:start position:0%
the clerk's office i went to the clerk
 
01:32:56.629 --> 01:32:56.639 align:start position:0%
and they said it was the technical
 
01:32:58.310 --> 01:32:58.320 align:start position:0%
office and so i kept bouncing back and
 
01:32:59.910 --> 01:32:59.920 align:start position:0%
forth for about six months until i kind
 
01:33:02.229 --> 01:33:02.239 align:start position:0%
of got fed up and said i'm not above
 
01:33:04.149 --> 01:33:04.159 align:start position:0%
legislating this
 
01:33:06.790 --> 01:33:06.800 align:start position:0%
and that was 2017 so in 2018 i had this
 
01:33:06.800 --> 01:33:07.830 align:start position:0%
and that was 2017 so in 2018 i had this
bill

01:33:07.830 --> 01:33:07.840 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:33:10.310 --> 01:33:10.320 align:start position:0%
and that bill was before this committee
 
01:33:12.550 --> 01:33:12.560 align:start position:0%
um and the chair was the honorable dick
 
01:33:15.830 --> 01:33:15.840 align:start position:0%
hench and out of that hearing it was otp
 
01:33:18.149 --> 01:33:18.159 align:start position:0%
unanimous on the consent calendar went
 
01:33:20.229 --> 01:33:20.239 align:start position:0%
over to the senate and in the senate the
 
01:33:22.310 --> 01:33:22.320 align:start position:0%
senate heard testimony from staff saying
 
01:33:24.390 --> 01:33:24.400 align:start position:0%
you don't have to legislate this
 
01:33:26.070 --> 01:33:26.080 align:start position:0%
we're going to do it we're going to do
 
01:33:27.669 --> 01:33:27.679 align:start position:0%
it on our own
 
01:33:29.270 --> 01:33:29.280 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
01:33:31.189 --> 01:33:31.199 align:start position:0%
they didn't so the senate killed it but
 
01:33:33.189 --> 01:33:33.199 align:start position:0%
they didn't do it and so three years go
 
01:33:33.199 --> 01:33:34.470 align:start position:0%
they didn't do it and so three years go
by

01:33:34.470 --> 01:33:34.480 align:start position:0%
by
 
01:33:37.030 --> 01:33:37.040 align:start position:0%
and now i was uh knowing last year i was
 
01:33:39.270 --> 01:33:39.280 align:start position:0%
putting in bills in september i started
 
01:33:41.030 --> 01:33:41.040 align:start position:0%
going to the technical department i said
 
01:33:43.270 --> 01:33:43.280 align:start position:0%
hey can you just get this done because
 
01:33:44.390 --> 01:33:44.400 align:start position:0%

01:33:45.830 --> 01:33:45.840 align:start position:0%
ago this got done
 
01:33:47.830 --> 01:33:47.840 align:start position:0%
and i was promised it would be done and
 
01:33:48.870 --> 01:33:48.880 align:start position:0%
they killed the bill because they
 
01:33:50.470 --> 01:33:50.480 align:start position:0%
promised it would be done and it wasn't
 
01:33:52.149 --> 01:33:52.159 align:start position:0%
gonna it never was done
 
01:33:54.229 --> 01:33:54.239 align:start position:0%
and i said if you don't do it i'm gonna
 
01:33:55.750 --> 01:33:55.760 align:start position:0%
have to put in a bill
 
01:33:57.990 --> 01:33:58.000 align:start position:0%
so they didn't do it and i put in a bill
 
01:33:59.830 --> 01:33:59.840 align:start position:0%
having said that we're arriving at the
 
01:34:02.070 --> 01:34:02.080 align:start position:0%
fun conclusion which is just last week
 
01:34:03.669 --> 01:34:03.679 align:start position:0%
the honorable clerk brought me into his
 
01:34:05.350 --> 01:34:05.360 align:start position:0%
office and said look we're doing it and
 
01:34:07.189 --> 01:34:07.199 align:start position:0%
he showed me and i believe he's here to
 
01:34:08.709 --> 01:34:08.719 align:start position:0%
show you today
 
01:34:11.270 --> 01:34:11.280 align:start position:0%
so i would say i'm happy for this not to
 
01:34:13.830 --> 01:34:13.840 align:start position:0%
be legislated i'm happy for
 
01:34:15.910 --> 01:34:15.920 align:start position:0%
the the departments that exist to
 
01:34:17.590 --> 01:34:17.600 align:start position:0%
actually do this correctly and just get
 
01:34:19.030 --> 01:34:19.040 align:start position:0%
it done
 
01:34:21.110 --> 01:34:21.120 align:start position:0%
because transparency is really important
 
01:34:23.669 --> 01:34:23.679 align:start position:0%
and this costs us nothing
 
01:34:25.430 --> 01:34:25.440 align:start position:0%
having said that i would just simply
 
01:34:27.189 --> 01:34:27.199 align:start position:0%
request that this committee hold off on
 
01:34:30.149 --> 01:34:30.159 align:start position:0%
exacting until that is actually up and
 
01:34:32.390 --> 01:34:32.400 align:start position:0%
uh up on the website and available to
 
01:34:33.990 --> 01:34:34.000 align:start position:0%
the public but that's all
 
01:34:35.270 --> 01:34:35.280 align:start position:0%
that's all i have
 
01:34:37.590 --> 01:34:37.600 align:start position:0%
great thank you uh would you accept
 
01:34:37.600 --> 01:34:41.189 align:start position:0%
great thank you uh would you accept
questions

01:34:41.189 --> 01:34:41.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:43.430 --> 01:34:43.440 align:start position:0%
i think you're off the hook i think so
 
01:34:44.950 --> 01:34:44.960 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your testimony
 
01:34:50.870 --> 01:34:50.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:50.880 --> 01:34:51.750 align:start position:0%
 
i

01:34:51.750 --> 01:34:51.760 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:34:55.350 --> 01:34:55.360 align:start position:0%
have no other pink cards but perhaps the
 
01:35:01.830 --> 01:35:01.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:03.910 --> 01:35:03.920 align:start position:0%
perhaps the
 
01:35:05.910 --> 01:35:05.920 align:start position:0%
house clerk would like to use his pink
 
01:35:08.790 --> 01:35:08.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:10.790 --> 01:35:10.800 align:start position:0%
come to the microphone thank you very
 
01:35:13.189 --> 01:35:13.199 align:start position:0%
much well good morning mr chairman and
 
01:35:15.590 --> 01:35:15.600 align:start position:0%
honorable members of the best committee
 
01:35:16.870 --> 01:35:16.880 align:start position:0%
in the new hampshire house of
 
01:35:19.030 --> 01:35:19.040 align:start position:0%
representatives uh my name for the
 
01:35:20.790 --> 01:35:20.800 align:start position:0%
record is paul smith i am the clerk of
 
01:35:23.910 --> 01:35:23.920 align:start position:0%
the house um so just a little bit of
 
01:35:25.750 --> 01:35:25.760 align:start position:0%
history not to conflict with my
 
01:35:27.510 --> 01:35:27.520 align:start position:0%
honorable friend uh the member from
 
01:35:27.520 --> 01:35:28.390 align:start position:0%
honorable friend uh the member from
newmarket

01:35:28.390 --> 01:35:28.400 align:start position:0%
newmarket
 
01:35:28.400 --> 01:35:29.189 align:start position:0%
newmarket
um

01:35:29.189 --> 01:35:29.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:35:30.950 --> 01:35:30.960 align:start position:0%
that being said you know obviously
 
01:35:33.109 --> 01:35:33.119 align:start position:0%
legislation was killed in the past uh
 
01:35:34.870 --> 01:35:34.880 align:start position:0%
we've had this little pesky thing called
 
01:35:38.390 --> 01:35:38.400 align:start position:0%
the pandemic for the past almost two
 
01:35:40.629 --> 01:35:40.639 align:start position:0%
years now that have put a significant
 
01:35:42.390 --> 01:35:42.400 align:start position:0%
damper on things
 
01:35:45.590 --> 01:35:45.600 align:start position:0%
one was the rollout of the new website
 
01:35:47.350 --> 01:35:47.360 align:start position:0%
the the new website was rolled out on
 
01:35:50.070 --> 01:35:50.080 align:start position:0%
november 1st and many upgrades uh came
 
01:35:51.830 --> 01:35:51.840 align:start position:0%
along with that including one that i
 
01:35:54.149 --> 01:35:54.159 align:start position:0%
testified in in behalf of this committee
 
01:35:55.669 --> 01:35:55.679 align:start position:0%
last year
 
01:35:57.669 --> 01:35:57.679 align:start position:0%
in legislation dealing with putting
 
01:35:59.750 --> 01:35:59.760 align:start position:0%
amendments on the website if you go onto
 
01:36:01.590 --> 01:36:01.600 align:start position:0%
the website now and you look on the
 
01:36:04.149 --> 01:36:04.159 align:start position:0%
various bill dockets you will see all
 
01:36:05.590 --> 01:36:05.600 align:start position:0%
amendments that have been offered on
 
01:36:06.950 --> 01:36:06.960 align:start position:0%
that bill
 
01:36:08.790 --> 01:36:08.800 align:start position:0%
so again
 
01:36:10.070 --> 01:36:10.080 align:start position:0%
the there's the question about
 
01:36:13.270 --> 01:36:13.280 align:start position:0%
legislating policy uh for internal
 
01:36:16.149 --> 01:36:16.159 align:start position:0%
workings versus um you know legislating
 
01:36:18.070 --> 01:36:18.080 align:start position:0%
important things like you know education
 
01:36:20.709 --> 01:36:20.719 align:start position:0%
funding um so i i would just note that
 
01:36:23.830 --> 01:36:23.840 align:start position:0%
that yes we are rolling things out i
 
01:36:26.709 --> 01:36:26.719 align:start position:0%
actually do have the subscription
 
01:36:27.990 --> 01:36:28.000 align:start position:0%
link page
 
01:36:29.830 --> 01:36:29.840 align:start position:0%
to show you i was going to just walk
 
01:36:31.270 --> 01:36:31.280 align:start position:0%
around and show you that briefly mr
 
01:36:31.280 --> 01:36:32.390 align:start position:0%
around and show you that briefly mr
chairman

01:36:32.390 --> 01:36:32.400 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
01:36:36.550 --> 01:36:36.560 align:start position:0%
if if that is okay with the committee
 
01:36:39.030 --> 01:36:39.040 align:start position:0%
in it is part of a larger project
 
01:36:40.870 --> 01:36:40.880 align:start position:0%
it is part of a larger project that has
 
01:36:42.950 --> 01:36:42.960 align:start position:0%
been ongoing for several years and that
 
01:36:45.510 --> 01:36:45.520 align:start position:0%
is to create a portal for members of the
 
01:36:48.310 --> 01:36:48.320 align:start position:0%
public to log in and be able to track
 
01:36:51.189 --> 01:36:51.199 align:start position:0%
multiple things including legislation
 
01:36:52.550 --> 01:36:52.560 align:start position:0%
that's important to them so that they
 
01:36:54.629 --> 01:36:54.639 align:start position:0%
can get text alerts they can get sms
 
01:36:57.669 --> 01:36:57.679 align:start position:0%
updates etc uh the the point is we do
 
01:36:57.679 --> 01:36:59.030 align:start position:0%
updates etc uh the the point is we do
want

01:36:59.030 --> 01:36:59.040 align:start position:0%
want
 
01:37:01.030 --> 01:37:01.040 align:start position:0%
people to be aware of what's happening
 
01:37:03.669 --> 01:37:03.679 align:start position:0%
here we do want uh people to know what's
 
01:37:06.470 --> 01:37:06.480 align:start position:0%
going on so they can be involved so this
 
01:37:09.189 --> 01:37:09.199 align:start position:0%
is part of a of a larger process
 
01:37:09.199 --> 01:37:09.910 align:start position:0%
is part of a of a larger process
to

01:37:09.910 --> 01:37:09.920 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:37:11.910 --> 01:37:11.920 align:start position:0%
increase accountability for our members
 
01:37:15.189 --> 01:37:15.199 align:start position:0%
and accessibility for the public so uh i
 
01:37:17.590 --> 01:37:17.600 align:start position:0%
do i'll just quickly show you this if
 
01:37:19.030 --> 01:37:19.040 align:start position:0%
you do yes
 
01:37:21.189 --> 01:37:21.199 align:start position:0%
are we up and running with that larger
 
01:37:24.070 --> 01:37:24.080 align:start position:0%
project or is that oh this is it it's
 
01:37:25.750 --> 01:37:25.760 align:start position:0%
part of a project that's being worked on
 
01:37:27.270 --> 01:37:27.280 align:start position:0%
now but it has been
 
01:37:29.270 --> 01:37:29.280 align:start position:0%
it's been certainly a long-term goal of
 
01:37:32.390 --> 01:37:32.400 align:start position:0%
mine um to have the ability for
 
01:37:34.070 --> 01:37:34.080 align:start position:0%
for the public to be able to log into
 
01:37:37.109 --> 01:37:37.119 align:start position:0%
their own portal uh you you know uh for
 
01:37:39.270 --> 01:37:39.280 align:start position:0%
for all of the members um you know that
 
01:37:41.990 --> 01:37:42.000 align:start position:0%
we switched to a legislative portal for
 
01:37:44.390 --> 01:37:44.400 align:start position:0%
members this year uh in terms of
 
01:37:46.629 --> 01:37:46.639 align:start position:0%
collecting your data for
 
01:37:49.910 --> 01:37:49.920 align:start position:0%
um the work that we do internally uh and
 
01:37:51.750 --> 01:37:51.760 align:start position:0%
and we're hoping to utilize some of the
 
01:37:54.149 --> 01:37:54.159 align:start position:0%
same sort of structure so that people
 
01:37:56.550 --> 01:37:56.560 align:start position:0%
can get those alerts and and that sort
 
01:37:59.189 --> 01:37:59.199 align:start position:0%
of thing for legislation upcoming
 
01:38:01.590 --> 01:38:01.600 align:start position:0%
um rollout date
 
01:38:03.270 --> 01:38:03.280 align:start position:0%
is it next year or is it i can't tell
 
01:38:05.350 --> 01:38:05.360 align:start position:0%
you that i'm not a developer i'm i'm
 
01:38:09.030 --> 01:38:09.040 align:start position:0%
just part of a smattering process now it
 
01:38:11.510 --> 01:38:11.520 align:start position:0%
is part of the project yes sir
 
01:38:14.550 --> 01:38:14.560 align:start position:0%

01:38:22.390 --> 01:38:22.400 align:start position:0%
not sure how others feel
 
01:38:24.229 --> 01:38:24.239 align:start position:0%
that'd be great i think we're all set
 
01:38:27.430 --> 01:38:27.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:29.750 --> 01:38:29.760 align:start position:0%
actually with that no other pink cards
 
01:38:30.950 --> 01:38:30.960 align:start position:0%
no other
 
01:38:32.470 --> 01:38:32.480 align:start position:0%
representative weiler doesn't want to
 
01:38:34.950 --> 01:38:34.960 align:start position:0%
speak on this bill
 
01:38:37.590 --> 01:38:37.600 align:start position:0%

01:38:40.470 --> 01:38:40.480 align:start position:0%
house bill 1083
 
01:38:42.470 --> 01:38:42.480 align:start position:0%
with the suggestion that we will hold
 
01:38:49.109 --> 01:38:49.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:24.709 --> 01:46:24.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:27.750 --> 01:46:27.760 align:start position:0%

01:46:33.600 --> 01:46:35.590 align:start position:0%
open the hearing on
1084

01:46:35.590 --> 01:46:35.600 align:start position:0%
1084
 
01:46:38.390 --> 01:46:38.400 align:start position:0%
and represent and recognize the prime
 
01:46:41.510 --> 01:46:41.520 align:start position:0%
sponsor representative reed thank you mr
 
01:46:43.030 --> 01:46:43.040 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you honorable members
 
01:46:45.350 --> 01:46:45.360 align:start position:0%
once again again for the record my name
 
01:46:47.590 --> 01:46:47.600 align:start position:0%
is ellen reed i represent rockingham 17
 
01:46:49.910 --> 01:46:49.920 align:start position:0%
new market and new fields
 
01:46:52.709 --> 01:46:52.719 align:start position:0%
so this is a kind of a transparency and
 
01:46:55.270 --> 01:46:55.280 align:start position:0%
government bill that
 
01:46:58.870 --> 01:46:58.880 align:start position:0%
that costs really nothing
 
01:47:01.430 --> 01:47:01.440 align:start position:0%
and operates much the same way that we
 
01:47:02.950 --> 01:47:02.960 align:start position:0%
currently operate things like for
 
01:47:05.590 --> 01:47:05.600 align:start position:0%
example money you know you know gifts
 
01:47:07.590 --> 01:47:07.600 align:start position:0%
from organizations the only difference
 
01:47:07.600 --> 01:47:08.390 align:start position:0%
from organizations the only difference
here

01:47:08.390 --> 01:47:08.400 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:47:10.870 --> 01:47:10.880 align:start position:0%
is that in essence if a legislator
 
01:47:13.030 --> 01:47:13.040 align:start position:0%
receives model legislation
 
01:47:15.270 --> 01:47:15.280 align:start position:0%
from an organization that they simply
 
01:47:18.390 --> 01:47:18.400 align:start position:0%
have to tell ols that they received it
 
01:47:20.310 --> 01:47:20.320 align:start position:0%
from this organization and that the name
 
01:47:21.590 --> 01:47:21.600 align:start position:0%
of that organization would then appear
 
01:47:23.030 --> 01:47:23.040 align:start position:0%
on the bill
 
01:47:24.790 --> 01:47:24.800 align:start position:0%
it's kind of the honor system if they
 
01:47:28.629 --> 01:47:28.639 align:start position:0%
don't do that and someone later on says
 
01:47:31.030 --> 01:47:31.040 align:start position:0%
hey this bill is exactly identical to
 
01:47:32.629 --> 01:47:32.639 align:start position:0%
this organization's bill that they're
 
01:47:35.109 --> 01:47:35.119 align:start position:0%
proposing then it's up to the chair of
 
01:47:36.790 --> 01:47:36.800 align:start position:0%
that committee to determine whether or
 
01:47:39.669 --> 01:47:39.679 align:start position:0%
not the bill should have a little line
 
01:47:40.950 --> 01:47:40.960 align:start position:0%
that says this is from whatever
 
01:47:43.189 --> 01:47:43.199 align:start position:0%
organization and the chair has 10 days
 
01:47:44.870 --> 01:47:44.880 align:start position:0%
to make that determination it's as
 
01:47:46.790 --> 01:47:46.800 align:start position:0%
simple as that
 
01:47:48.790 --> 01:47:48.800 align:start position:0%
the idea of the bill
 
01:47:50.629 --> 01:47:50.639 align:start position:0%
and certainly i think and i know i've
 
01:47:52.310 --> 01:47:52.320 align:start position:0%
put in bills from organizations so this
 
01:47:54.629 --> 01:47:54.639 align:start position:0%
is not at all like an anti you can't
 
01:47:57.350 --> 01:47:57.360 align:start position:0%
work with organizations of course we can
 
01:47:59.030 --> 01:47:59.040 align:start position:0%
organizations do a lot of the heavy
 
01:48:01.830 --> 01:48:01.840 align:start position:0%
lifting um they can pay lawyers and
 
01:48:04.229 --> 01:48:04.239 align:start position:0%
obviously i can't pay anyone to do work
 
01:48:06.790 --> 01:48:06.800 align:start position:0%
for me so that's fine but it's up the
 
01:48:08.629 --> 01:48:08.639 align:start position:0%
public should know the public should
 
01:48:08.639 --> 01:48:09.510 align:start position:0%
public should know the public should
know

01:48:09.510 --> 01:48:09.520 align:start position:0%
know
 
01:48:11.750 --> 01:48:11.760 align:start position:0%
if a particular piece of legislation has
 
01:48:14.149 --> 01:48:14.159 align:start position:0%
come from an organization or not uh in
 
01:48:16.550 --> 01:48:16.560 align:start position:0%
this and by the way this was my
 
01:48:18.709 --> 01:48:18.719 align:start position:0%
predecessor marsha moody's
 
01:48:20.709 --> 01:48:20.719 align:start position:0%
bill but this has gone through many many
 
01:48:22.629 --> 01:48:22.639 align:start position:0%
iterations she had kind of like this big
 
01:48:22.639 --> 01:48:23.910 align:start position:0%
iterations she had kind of like this big
complex

01:48:23.910 --> 01:48:23.920 align:start position:0%
complex
 
01:48:25.590 --> 01:48:25.600 align:start position:0%
you know confusing thing and this is
 
01:48:28.550 --> 01:48:28.560 align:start position:0%
just a very very simple disclosure thing
 
01:48:31.910 --> 01:48:31.920 align:start position:0%
um in this particular version of this i
 
01:48:31.920 --> 01:48:33.270 align:start position:0%
um in this particular version of this i
have

01:48:33.270 --> 01:48:33.280 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:48:35.830 --> 01:48:35.840 align:start position:0%
done basically the most conservative by
 
01:48:37.669 --> 01:48:37.679 align:start position:0%
saying it only applies
 
01:48:40.149 --> 01:48:40.159 align:start position:0%
to organizations that
 
01:48:42.310 --> 01:48:42.320 align:start position:0%
interact with elected officials
 
01:48:44.390 --> 01:48:44.400 align:start position:0%
in more than one state
 
01:48:46.310 --> 01:48:46.320 align:start position:0%
so if this committee wanted to extend
 
01:48:48.149 --> 01:48:48.159 align:start position:0%
that to organizations within the state
 
01:48:49.830 --> 01:48:49.840 align:start position:0%
that only deal with
 
01:48:51.750 --> 01:48:51.760 align:start position:0%
people in the state then that would be
 
01:48:53.590 --> 01:48:53.600 align:start position:0%
totally something i would support but
 
01:48:55.910 --> 01:48:55.920 align:start position:0%
i'm being as conservative as possible by
 
01:48:58.870 --> 01:48:58.880 align:start position:0%
saying this right now it only applies if
 
01:49:00.390 --> 01:49:00.400 align:start position:0%
an organization has put out model
 
01:49:02.470 --> 01:49:02.480 align:start position:0%
legislation and is
 
01:49:04.629 --> 01:49:04.639 align:start position:0%
interacting or asking legislators from
 
01:49:06.229 --> 01:49:06.239 align:start position:0%
more than one state to adopt that
 
01:49:06.239 --> 01:49:07.990 align:start position:0%
more than one state to adopt that
legislation

01:49:07.990 --> 01:49:08.000 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
01:49:10.790 --> 01:49:10.800 align:start position:0%
but that's basically it i think i've
 
01:49:12.709 --> 01:49:12.719 align:start position:0%
explained it and the purpose behind it
 
01:49:14.149 --> 01:49:14.159 align:start position:0%
and just a transparency thing and i'm
 
01:49:15.910 --> 01:49:15.920 align:start position:0%
happy to take questions
 
01:49:19.510 --> 01:49:19.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony um
 
01:49:21.830 --> 01:49:21.840 align:start position:0%
i see one question from representative
 
01:49:21.840 --> 01:49:23.669 align:start position:0%
i see one question from representative
green

01:49:23.669 --> 01:49:23.679 align:start position:0%
green
 
01:49:25.270 --> 01:49:25.280 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
01:49:26.790 --> 01:49:26.800 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
01:49:28.790 --> 01:49:28.800 align:start position:0%
where i've come to the understanding of
 
01:49:30.870 --> 01:49:30.880 align:start position:0%
recently is that
 
01:49:32.550 --> 01:49:32.560 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of instances where a
 
01:49:35.030 --> 01:49:35.040 align:start position:0%
legislate a legislator will go to an
 
01:49:37.350 --> 01:49:37.360 align:start position:0%
organization and discuss an idea for a
 
01:49:40.310 --> 01:49:40.320 align:start position:0%
bill which results in model legislation
 
01:49:40.320 --> 01:49:41.669 align:start position:0%
bill which results in model legislation
so

01:49:41.669 --> 01:49:41.679 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:49:44.070 --> 01:49:44.080 align:start position:0%
i wonder if we're kind of getting into a
 
01:49:46.070 --> 01:49:46.080 align:start position:0%
chicken versus the egg thing as to
 
01:49:47.910 --> 01:49:47.920 align:start position:0%
origin i mean is it truly from our
 
01:49:51.109 --> 01:49:51.119 align:start position:0%
organization or did they get their idea
 
01:49:53.270 --> 01:49:53.280 align:start position:0%
was the impetus from a legislator who
 
01:49:55.109 --> 01:49:55.119 align:start position:0%
talked to that organization so what do
 
01:49:57.030 --> 01:49:57.040 align:start position:0%
we do about this sort of thing thank you
 
01:49:58.229 --> 01:49:58.239 align:start position:0%
so much for that question because that's
 
01:49:59.669 --> 01:49:59.679 align:start position:0%
the part that i didn't actually go into
 
01:50:01.030 --> 01:50:01.040 align:start position:0%
on the on the bill so this is
 
01:50:04.390 --> 01:50:04.400 align:start position:0%
specifically only if the organization as
 
01:50:07.189 --> 01:50:07.199 align:start position:0%
an organization has voted to adopt that
 
01:50:08.950 --> 01:50:08.960 align:start position:0%
model legislation so if i go to
 
01:50:10.550 --> 01:50:10.560 align:start position:0%
organization and say hey do you have
 
01:50:12.070 --> 01:50:12.080 align:start position:0%
some information or can i borrow your
 
01:50:14.310 --> 01:50:14.320 align:start position:0%
lawyer or can i pick your brains for
 
01:50:15.830 --> 01:50:15.840 align:start position:0%
this information and what what do you
 
01:50:17.270 --> 01:50:17.280 align:start position:0%
think you would support and they go you
 
01:50:19.030 --> 01:50:19.040 align:start position:0%
know we would like this language that's
 
01:50:20.790 --> 01:50:20.800 align:start position:0%
fine that doesn't need any disclosure
 
01:50:22.470 --> 01:50:22.480 align:start position:0%
but if an organization has officially
 
01:50:25.510 --> 01:50:25.520 align:start position:0%
adopted yes we support this bill
 
01:50:28.070 --> 01:50:28.080 align:start position:0%
and then you put in that bill or someone
 
01:50:30.070 --> 01:50:30.080 align:start position:0%
substantively the same
 
01:50:31.669 --> 01:50:31.679 align:start position:0%
then you would just simply as a
 
01:50:33.830 --> 01:50:33.840 align:start position:0%
legislator have to tell ols actually i
 
01:50:35.270 --> 01:50:35.280 align:start position:0%
got this from
 
01:50:37.990 --> 01:50:38.000 align:start position:0%
you know america is great you know pac
 
01:50:39.830 --> 01:50:39.840 align:start position:0%
or whatever you know whatever
 
01:50:39.840 --> 01:50:41.189 align:start position:0%
or whatever you know whatever
organization

01:50:41.189 --> 01:50:41.199 align:start position:0%
organization
 
01:50:41.199 --> 01:50:41.990 align:start position:0%
organization
so

01:50:41.990 --> 01:50:42.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:50:44.629 --> 01:50:44.639 align:start position:0%
uh that's it's only limited to again
 
01:50:46.149 --> 01:50:46.159 align:start position:0%
organizations operate in more than one
 
01:50:48.470 --> 01:50:48.480 align:start position:0%
state and again if only if they've
 
01:50:50.470 --> 01:50:50.480 align:start position:0%
officially like the board has officially
 
01:50:53.030 --> 01:50:53.040 align:start position:0%
voted to adopt that stance on that
 
01:50:58.629 --> 01:50:58.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:58.639 --> 01:51:01.669 align:start position:0%
 
representative

01:51:01.669 --> 01:51:01.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:03.030 --> 01:51:03.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you
 
01:51:04.709 --> 01:51:04.719 align:start position:0%
representative for your testimony and
 
01:51:06.550 --> 01:51:06.560 align:start position:0%
for your work on this
 
01:51:09.589 --> 01:51:09.599 align:start position:0%
i'm looking at lines 14 15
 
01:51:09.599 --> 01:51:10.550 align:start position:0%
i'm looking at lines 14 15
and

01:51:10.550 --> 01:51:10.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:51:13.669 --> 01:51:13.679 align:start position:0%
i see that a written request would be
 
01:51:15.910 --> 01:51:15.920 align:start position:0%
made to the chairperson of the committee
 
01:51:17.030 --> 01:51:17.040 align:start position:0%
to where the
 
01:51:19.189 --> 01:51:19.199 align:start position:0%
which the bill is assigned
 
01:51:21.350 --> 01:51:21.360 align:start position:0%
then it says the chairperson shall issue
 
01:51:24.790 --> 01:51:24.800 align:start position:0%
a ruling within 10 business days
 
01:51:26.629 --> 01:51:26.639 align:start position:0%
it doesn't say that the chairperson will
 
01:51:28.470 --> 01:51:28.480 align:start position:0%
be working with the committees puts a
 
01:51:31.830 --> 01:51:31.840 align:start position:0%
burden on the chairperson apparently
 
01:51:32.950 --> 01:51:32.960 align:start position:0%
all that's
 
01:51:35.430 --> 01:51:35.440 align:start position:0%
thank you and following that just so
 
01:51:38.470 --> 01:51:38.480 align:start position:0%
your answer can include both please
 
01:51:40.870 --> 01:51:40.880 align:start position:0%
decisions of the committee chairperson
 
01:51:43.270 --> 01:51:43.280 align:start position:0%
may be appealed is this all on the
 
01:51:43.280 --> 01:51:44.790 align:start position:0%
may be appealed is this all on the
chairperson

01:51:44.790 --> 01:51:44.800 align:start position:0%
chairperson
 
01:51:46.310 --> 01:51:46.320 align:start position:0%
um so
 
01:51:48.229 --> 01:51:48.239 align:start position:0%
literally all that has to happen for the
 
01:51:50.470 --> 01:51:50.480 align:start position:0%
chair to make their decision is to look
 
01:51:52.229 --> 01:51:52.239 align:start position:0%
at the model legislation that the person
 
01:51:53.589 --> 01:51:53.599 align:start position:0%
says hey it looks just like this
 
01:51:55.189 --> 01:51:55.199 align:start position:0%
organization's bill
 
01:51:56.950 --> 01:51:56.960 align:start position:0%
and then the bill and go
 
01:51:59.750 --> 01:51:59.760 align:start position:0%
yeah they look the same or no they're
 
01:52:01.830 --> 01:52:01.840 align:start position:0%
too far apart if we put it up to the
 
01:52:04.229 --> 01:52:04.239 align:start position:0%
entire committee that would require a
 
01:52:06.149 --> 01:52:06.159 align:start position:0%
meeting of the committee so that would
 
01:52:09.270 --> 01:52:09.280 align:start position:0%
be far too much i think burden um and
 
01:52:11.109 --> 01:52:11.119 align:start position:0%
it's easier for a chair at home to just
 
01:52:18.790 --> 01:52:18.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:21.589 --> 01:52:21.599 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question um
 
01:52:24.629 --> 01:52:24.639 align:start position:0%
a lot of times committee members when
 
01:52:27.109 --> 01:52:27.119 align:start position:0%
bills are introduced
 
01:52:29.750 --> 01:52:29.760 align:start position:0%
will ask whether it is model legislation
 
01:52:31.750 --> 01:52:31.760 align:start position:0%
and how they
 
01:52:33.910 --> 01:52:33.920 align:start position:0%
how they got the legislation that
 
01:52:36.229 --> 01:52:36.239 align:start position:0%
they're putting in or the person that is
 
01:52:37.910 --> 01:52:37.920 align:start position:0%
testifying that's admitting the bill or
 
01:52:39.750 --> 01:52:39.760 align:start position:0%
coming in later says it's model
 
01:52:42.629 --> 01:52:42.639 align:start position:0%
legislation from wherever it is
 
01:52:45.830 --> 01:52:45.840 align:start position:0%
we're i think we're doing that now
 
01:52:48.550 --> 01:52:48.560 align:start position:0%
but it's actually not put in the bill
 
01:52:49.430 --> 01:52:49.440 align:start position:0%
and so
 
01:52:52.149 --> 01:52:52.159 align:start position:0%
you would like to see it put in the bill
 
01:52:54.310 --> 01:52:54.320 align:start position:0%
right and if it's not put in the bill
 
01:52:56.149 --> 01:52:56.159 align:start position:0%
then the chairperson has to make a
 
01:52:57.910 --> 01:52:57.920 align:start position:0%
decision that it should be put in the
 
01:52:59.430 --> 01:52:59.440 align:start position:0%
bill and an amendment would have to come
 
01:52:59.440 --> 01:53:01.510 align:start position:0%
bill and an amendment would have to come
forward

01:53:01.510 --> 01:53:01.520 align:start position:0%
forward
 
01:53:03.750 --> 01:53:03.760 align:start position:0%
an amendment to the bill to add the
 
01:53:05.589 --> 01:53:05.599 align:start position:0%
model legislation no it's not an
 
01:53:07.750 --> 01:53:07.760 align:start position:0%
amendment so this is like not part of
 
01:53:11.350 --> 01:53:11.360 align:start position:0%
the actual bill itself the actual
 
01:53:13.589 --> 01:53:13.599 align:start position:0%
um part of the bill that changes rsa
 
01:53:15.910 --> 01:53:15.920 align:start position:0%
stays the same whatever that is but the
 
01:53:18.149 --> 01:53:18.159 align:start position:0%
front here all of that proceeding
 
01:53:20.070 --> 01:53:20.080 align:start position:0%
information where it says with the title
 
01:53:22.470 --> 01:53:22.480 align:start position:0%
who the sponsors the committee and the
 
01:53:24.790 --> 01:53:24.800 align:start position:0%
analysis what the bill does
 
01:53:26.550 --> 01:53:26.560 align:start position:0%
that part would just continue to have
 
01:53:29.270 --> 01:53:29.280 align:start position:0%
one it would have another line that says
 
01:53:30.950 --> 01:53:30.960 align:start position:0%
associated with what other whatever
 
01:53:33.109 --> 01:53:33.119 align:start position:0%
organization so it would just be a note
 
01:53:34.790 --> 01:53:34.800 align:start position:0%
at the header of the bill so there
 
01:53:36.870 --> 01:53:36.880 align:start position:0%
doesn't need to be an amendment and the
 
01:53:39.990 --> 01:53:40.000 align:start position:0%
chair only makes a ruling if the sponsor
 
01:53:41.750 --> 01:53:41.760 align:start position:0%
did not disclose that it was model
 
01:53:44.149 --> 01:53:44.159 align:start position:0%
legislation and someone from the public
 
01:53:46.229 --> 01:53:46.239 align:start position:0%
says this looks just like this model
 
01:53:48.229 --> 01:53:48.239 align:start position:0%
legislation so
 
01:53:50.390 --> 01:53:50.400 align:start position:0%
there's no penalty for the legislator
 
01:53:52.229 --> 01:53:52.239 align:start position:0%
it's you know it could have been done
 
01:53:53.990 --> 01:53:54.000 align:start position:0%
accidentally it could have been whatever
 
01:53:56.070 --> 01:53:56.080 align:start position:0%
there's no like ethical issue there it's
 
01:53:58.149 --> 01:53:58.159 align:start position:0%
just simply if a member of the public
 
01:54:00.149 --> 01:54:00.159 align:start position:0%
says hey this looks exactly like this
 
01:54:02.229 --> 01:54:02.239 align:start position:0%
organization's bill then the chair can
 
01:54:04.790 --> 01:54:04.800 align:start position:0%
go yeah let's add that disclosure line
 
01:54:06.830 --> 01:54:06.840 align:start position:0%
in the heading of the
 
01:54:08.950 --> 01:54:08.960 align:start position:0%
bill follow up
 
01:54:08.960 --> 01:54:09.910 align:start position:0%
bill follow up
um

01:54:09.910 --> 01:54:09.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:54:11.589 --> 01:54:11.599 align:start position:0%
i'm having a hard time understanding why
 
01:54:13.750 --> 01:54:13.760 align:start position:0%
this is necessary
 
01:54:16.550 --> 01:54:16.560 align:start position:0%
thank you um because and you're correct
 
01:54:18.310 --> 01:54:18.320 align:start position:0%
on some bills certainly not all i
 
01:54:19.430 --> 01:54:19.440 align:start position:0%
wouldn't even say necessarily the
 
01:54:21.910 --> 01:54:21.920 align:start position:0%
majority but on some bills legislators
 
01:54:23.990 --> 01:54:24.000 align:start position:0%
do say i'm putting this in for whatever
 
01:54:25.750 --> 01:54:25.760 align:start position:0%
organization or sometimes they're asked
 
01:54:27.510 --> 01:54:27.520 align:start position:0%
by a committee member but all of that
 
01:54:29.750 --> 01:54:29.760 align:start position:0%
information is deep deep within the
 
01:54:31.830 --> 01:54:31.840 align:start position:0%
committee records so if somebody had the
 
01:54:33.990 --> 01:54:34.000 align:start position:0%
wherewithal and the time and the energy
 
01:54:36.470 --> 01:54:36.480 align:start position:0%
to search that and hopefully the issue
 
01:54:38.709 --> 01:54:38.719 align:start position:0%
was brought up by either the sponsor or
 
01:54:40.550 --> 01:54:40.560 align:start position:0%
a committee member then they might be
 
01:54:42.390 --> 01:54:42.400 align:start position:0%
able to find that information by
 
01:54:44.550 --> 01:54:44.560 align:start position:0%
searching committee records but those
 
01:54:46.550 --> 01:54:46.560 align:start position:0%
are not as easily found
 
01:54:49.109 --> 01:54:49.119 align:start position:0%
as the bill itself so having a little
 
01:54:51.669 --> 01:54:51.679 align:start position:0%
tiny line just a one line saying
 
01:54:52.790 --> 01:54:52.800 align:start position:0%
this is a
 
01:54:54.070 --> 01:54:54.080 align:start position:0%
you know this has been disclosed as
 
01:54:55.750 --> 01:54:55.760 align:start position:0%
being from this organization
 
01:54:58.070 --> 01:54:58.080 align:start position:0%
is is all it takes much more accessible
 
01:54:59.830 --> 01:54:59.840 align:start position:0%
to the public and much more uniform
 
01:55:01.270 --> 01:55:01.280 align:start position:0%
because it's not up to whether or not
 
01:55:03.350 --> 01:55:03.360 align:start position:0%
the sponsor happened to bring it up or
 
01:55:04.870 --> 01:55:04.880 align:start position:0%
whether or not a member of the committee
 
01:55:08.709 --> 01:55:08.719 align:start position:0%
happened to ask them thank you thank you
 
01:55:10.070 --> 01:55:10.080 align:start position:0%
i thought for sure there was going to be
 
01:55:13.189 --> 01:55:13.199 align:start position:0%
a follow-up representative expedia
 
01:55:14.870 --> 01:55:14.880 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you i'm
 
01:55:15.830 --> 01:55:15.840 align:start position:0%
sorry it was a little late to your
 
01:55:17.430 --> 01:55:17.440 align:start position:0%
testimony i
 
01:55:20.149 --> 01:55:20.159 align:start position:0%
i i like the a lot of a lot of the ideas
 
01:55:21.350 --> 01:55:21.360 align:start position:0%
of this so
 
01:55:22.709 --> 01:55:22.719 align:start position:0%
you know they wouldn't be penal they
 
01:55:25.669 --> 01:55:25.679 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be penalized and it's more of
 
01:55:27.750 --> 01:55:27.760 align:start position:0%
awareness for not just us on the
 
01:55:29.990 --> 01:55:30.000 align:start position:0%
committee but also for the public
 
01:55:30.000 --> 01:55:31.350 align:start position:0%
committee but also for the public
um

01:55:31.350 --> 01:55:31.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:55:34.550 --> 01:55:34.560 align:start position:0%
have you have you see
 
01:55:35.910 --> 01:55:35.920 align:start position:0%
now i'm asking i was like have you seen
 
01:55:37.589 --> 01:55:37.599 align:start position:0%
any kinds of bills like this anywhere
 
01:55:39.510 --> 01:55:39.520 align:start position:0%
else across the country of like where
 
01:55:42.070 --> 01:55:42.080 align:start position:0%
you know model legislation is is
 
01:55:42.080 --> 01:55:43.270 align:start position:0%
you know model legislation is is
disclosed

01:55:43.270 --> 01:55:43.280 align:start position:0%
disclosed
 
01:55:45.910 --> 01:55:45.920 align:start position:0%
i do know i can't give you exact states
 
01:55:47.910 --> 01:55:47.920 align:start position:0%
but i do happen to know from the work
 
01:55:49.589 --> 01:55:49.599 align:start position:0%
that my predecessor in my district
 
01:55:52.229 --> 01:55:52.239 align:start position:0%
before she passed away and i filled her
 
01:55:55.030 --> 01:55:55.040 align:start position:0%
seat um the work that she did was based
 
01:55:57.830 --> 01:55:57.840 align:start position:0%
on other states bills so i do know other
 
01:55:59.589 --> 01:55:59.599 align:start position:0%
states have worked on this
 
01:56:00.870 --> 01:56:00.880 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:56:02.070 --> 01:56:02.080 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:56:03.750 --> 01:56:03.760 align:start position:0%
representative simon
 
01:56:05.430 --> 01:56:05.440 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
01:56:07.510 --> 01:56:07.520 align:start position:0%
this may be a question out of
 
01:56:09.430 --> 01:56:09.440 align:start position:0%
youth little legislative ignorance i
 
01:56:11.189 --> 01:56:11.199 align:start position:0%
don't know
 
01:56:12.550 --> 01:56:12.560 align:start position:0%
but my understanding is when a
 
01:56:15.030 --> 01:56:15.040 align:start position:0%
legislator brings a bill forward it's
 
01:56:17.430 --> 01:56:17.440 align:start position:0%
technically their bill at this point
 
01:56:20.070 --> 01:56:20.080 align:start position:0%
um what is the importance of disclosing
 
01:56:22.229 --> 01:56:22.239 align:start position:0%
that it's come from another source if
 
01:56:23.750 --> 01:56:23.760 align:start position:0%
the bill is good then the bill is good
 
01:56:25.589 --> 01:56:25.599 align:start position:0%
if the bill is bad excuse me the bill's
 
01:56:27.669 --> 01:56:27.679 align:start position:0%
bad um and we vote on it according to
 
01:56:29.270 --> 01:56:29.280 align:start position:0%
its merits from your perspective what is
 
01:56:30.550 --> 01:56:30.560 align:start position:0%
the importance of knowing where it came
 
01:56:33.350 --> 01:56:33.360 align:start position:0%
from all of that is correct it is the
 
01:56:35.030 --> 01:56:35.040 align:start position:0%
legislators bill and technically i guess
 
01:56:36.390 --> 01:56:36.400 align:start position:0%
it's actually the committee's bill as
 
01:56:38.709 --> 01:56:38.719 align:start position:0%
soon as it's assigned to a committee um
 
01:56:41.030 --> 01:56:41.040 align:start position:0%
and it is voted on its merits nothing in
 
01:56:44.070 --> 01:56:44.080 align:start position:0%
that changes but understanding which
 
01:56:46.470 --> 01:56:46.480 align:start position:0%
organizations um are influencing that
 
01:56:51.750 --> 01:56:51.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:51.760 --> 01:56:52.470 align:start position:0%
 
just

01:56:52.470 --> 01:56:52.480 align:start position:0%
just
 
01:56:54.310 --> 01:56:54.320 align:start position:0%
from your perspective why is that
 
01:56:54.320 --> 01:56:56.149 align:start position:0%
from your perspective why is that
important

01:56:56.149 --> 01:56:56.159 align:start position:0%
important
 
01:56:59.430 --> 01:56:59.440 align:start position:0%
i i that seems so obvious to me that i
 
01:57:01.189 --> 01:57:01.199 align:start position:0%
guess i would say why isn't it i think
 
01:57:03.669 --> 01:57:03.679 align:start position:0%
that i it as a matter of philosophy i
 
01:57:05.430 --> 01:57:05.440 align:start position:0%
think that the public has a right to
 
01:57:07.750 --> 01:57:07.760 align:start position:0%
know pretty much everything that their
 
01:57:09.270 --> 01:57:09.280 align:start position:0%
legislators do
 
01:57:11.589 --> 01:57:11.599 align:start position:0%
in terms of legislating
 
01:57:13.350 --> 01:57:13.360 align:start position:0%
not personal lives but everything they
 
01:57:15.589 --> 01:57:15.599 align:start position:0%
do in terms of legislating all the work
 
01:57:17.510 --> 01:57:17.520 align:start position:0%
that we do up here should be 100 percent
 
01:57:17.520 --> 01:57:19.189 align:start position:0%
that we do up here should be 100 percent
transparent

01:57:19.189 --> 01:57:19.199 align:start position:0%
transparent
 
01:57:20.229 --> 01:57:20.239 align:start position:0%
one more
 
01:57:21.910 --> 01:57:21.920 align:start position:0%
so sorry i'm just trying to understand
 
01:57:24.070 --> 01:57:24.080 align:start position:0%
it from that perspective
 
01:57:27.189 --> 01:57:27.199 align:start position:0%
so if i were to bring a bill forward
 
01:57:27.199 --> 01:57:28.310 align:start position:0%
so if i were to bring a bill forward
and

01:57:28.310 --> 01:57:28.320 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:57:29.510 --> 01:57:29.520 align:start position:0%
the public thought that it was a good
 
01:57:31.430 --> 01:57:31.440 align:start position:0%
bill let's say because of course that
 
01:57:33.510 --> 01:57:33.520 align:start position:0%
would be the case
 
01:57:35.189 --> 01:57:35.199 align:start position:0%
but then they discovered
 
01:57:37.189 --> 01:57:37.199 align:start position:0%
that some organization
 
01:57:40.310 --> 01:57:40.320 align:start position:0%
actually propose this this bill
 
01:57:41.589 --> 01:57:41.599 align:start position:0%
is the assumption that it might
 
01:57:43.750 --> 01:57:43.760 align:start position:0%
potentially change somebody's opinion of
 
01:57:44.870 --> 01:57:44.880 align:start position:0%
the bill because they know where it's
 
01:57:46.149 --> 01:57:46.159 align:start position:0%
come from and that's why it's important
 
01:57:50.390 --> 01:57:50.400 align:start position:0%
for them to to know its origin like
 
01:57:52.390 --> 01:57:52.400 align:start position:0%
once again the the the contents of the
 
01:57:53.830 --> 01:57:53.840 align:start position:0%
bill is completely public already they
 
01:57:55.189 --> 01:57:55.199 align:start position:0%
can read the bill and determine on its
 
01:57:58.229 --> 01:57:58.239 align:start position:0%
merits whether it's good or not um i
 
01:58:00.070 --> 01:58:00.080 align:start position:0%
just wonder if it's important whether
 
01:58:02.629 --> 01:58:02.639 align:start position:0%
they know if representative wall brought
 
01:58:03.990 --> 01:58:04.000 align:start position:0%
it forward because she's maybe of a
 
01:58:06.229 --> 01:58:06.239 align:start position:0%
different opinion you know in general
 
01:58:07.510 --> 01:58:07.520 align:start position:0%
than i am
 
01:58:09.350 --> 01:58:09.360 align:start position:0%
is that going to affect their
 
01:58:11.270 --> 01:58:11.280 align:start position:0%
decision making or opinion in that
 
01:58:13.669 --> 01:58:13.679 align:start position:0%
fashion well in general i would say that
 
01:58:14.870 --> 01:58:14.880 align:start position:0%
if it's a good bill and the public
 
01:58:16.390 --> 01:58:16.400 align:start position:0%
supports it that in general they
 
01:58:19.109 --> 01:58:19.119 align:start position:0%
shouldn't care but what if for example a
 
01:58:21.830 --> 01:58:21.840 align:start position:0%
bill was brought forward that said
 
01:58:24.229 --> 01:58:24.239 align:start position:0%
and i'm going to fail to reach a
 
01:58:26.790 --> 01:58:26.800 align:start position:0%
specific example but that said we should
 
01:58:29.430 --> 01:58:29.440 align:start position:0%
treat certain organizations in this way
 
01:58:30.709 --> 01:58:30.719 align:start position:0%
and doesn't this make sense because
 
01:58:32.229 --> 01:58:32.239 align:start position:0%
these organizations over here are doing
 
01:58:34.390 --> 01:58:34.400 align:start position:0%
this and everybody says well that sounds
 
01:58:35.830 --> 01:58:35.840 align:start position:0%
right but then you find out that was
 
01:58:38.149 --> 01:58:38.159 align:start position:0%
actually put in or asked for by an
 
01:58:40.629 --> 01:58:40.639 align:start position:0%
organization that that would affect
 
01:58:43.910 --> 01:58:43.920 align:start position:0%
for example so i keep going back to
 
01:58:43.920 --> 01:58:45.510 align:start position:0%
for example so i keep going back to
if

01:58:45.510 --> 01:58:45.520 align:start position:0%
if
 
01:58:48.229 --> 01:58:48.239 align:start position:0%
if it's something that the public would
 
01:58:50.390 --> 01:58:50.400 align:start position:0%
feel anything about then they have a
 
01:58:51.510 --> 01:58:51.520 align:start position:0%
right to know because they have a right
 
01:58:53.350 --> 01:58:53.360 align:start position:0%
to know everything that goes on up here
 
01:58:56.229 --> 01:58:56.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:57.589 --> 01:58:57.599 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
01:58:59.350 --> 01:58:59.360 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much for your
 
01:59:01.990 --> 01:59:02.000 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you so much
 
01:59:06.470 --> 01:59:06.480 align:start position:0%
i see no other pink cards on
 
01:59:06.480 --> 01:59:07.350 align:start position:0%
i see no other pink cards on
up

01:59:07.350 --> 01:59:07.360 align:start position:0%
up
 
01:59:10.229 --> 01:59:10.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:12.390 --> 01:59:12.400 align:start position:0%
representative you can do that after
 
01:59:14.070 --> 01:59:14.080 align:start position:0%
this if you'd like
 
01:59:17.109 --> 01:59:17.119 align:start position:0%
a minute yep you've got it our
 
01:59:19.510 --> 01:59:19.520 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes
 
01:59:21.589 --> 01:59:21.599 align:start position:0%
representative weiler thank you mr
 
01:59:23.109 --> 01:59:23.119 align:start position:0%
chairman representative weiler
 
01:59:25.669 --> 01:59:25.679 align:start position:0%
rockingham district 13. i have put in
 
01:59:27.350 --> 01:59:27.360 align:start position:0%
many model bills
 
01:59:27.360 --> 01:59:28.229 align:start position:0%
many model bills
and

01:59:28.229 --> 01:59:28.239 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:59:29.430 --> 01:59:29.440 align:start position:0%
some of them
 
01:59:31.270 --> 01:59:31.280 align:start position:0%
i go to i've been a member of alec for
 
01:59:33.270 --> 01:59:33.280 align:start position:0%
25 plus years
 
01:59:36.070 --> 01:59:36.080 align:start position:0%
and sometimes you see a bill and
 
01:59:37.990 --> 01:59:38.000 align:start position:0%
and it's presented before us and it said
 
01:59:39.990 --> 01:59:40.000 align:start position:0%
here's what they did in ohio
 
01:59:41.589 --> 01:59:41.599 align:start position:0%
and you look at the bill and say wow
 
01:59:43.030 --> 01:59:43.040 align:start position:0%
that's a good idea
 
01:59:46.070 --> 01:59:46.080 align:start position:0%
and i remember one from kansas where
 
01:59:47.990 --> 01:59:48.000 align:start position:0%
a big law firm put up a lot of money to
 
01:59:49.910 --> 01:59:49.920 align:start position:0%
get one of their members elected as
 
01:59:51.430 --> 01:59:51.440 align:start position:0%
attorney general
 
01:59:53.669 --> 01:59:53.679 align:start position:0%
and then she turned around and she gave
 
01:59:56.709 --> 01:59:56.719 align:start position:0%
her law firm a contract for the
 
01:59:58.790 --> 01:59:58.800 align:start position:0%
tobacco settlement
 
02:00:01.750 --> 02:00:01.760 align:start position:0%
that all they had to do was take some 20
 
02:00:03.669 --> 02:00:03.679 align:start position:0%
pages change the name
 
02:00:05.510 --> 02:00:05.520 align:start position:0%
to kansas
 
02:00:08.149 --> 02:00:08.159 align:start position:0%
and collect 22 million dollars
 
02:00:10.310 --> 02:00:10.320 align:start position:0%
and wait a minute this doesn't seem
 
02:00:10.320 --> 02:00:11.430 align:start position:0%
and wait a minute this doesn't seem
right

02:00:11.430 --> 02:00:11.440 align:start position:0%
right
 
02:00:13.510 --> 02:00:13.520 align:start position:0%
so i put in a model bill so that that
 
02:00:14.950 --> 02:00:14.960 align:start position:0%
would not happen
 
02:00:17.430 --> 02:00:17.440 align:start position:0%
and quite often when i put in a model
 
02:00:19.030 --> 02:00:19.040 align:start position:0%
bill there's a certain member of the
 
02:00:21.270 --> 02:00:21.280 align:start position:0%
other party that always this is an alec
 
02:00:21.280 --> 02:00:22.070 align:start position:0%
other party that always this is an alec
bill

02:00:22.070 --> 02:00:22.080 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:00:24.470 --> 02:00:24.480 align:start position:0%
like ooh
 
02:00:27.189 --> 02:00:27.199 align:start position:0%
you know so
 
02:00:29.270 --> 02:00:29.280 align:start position:0%
i i don't like that inference because
 
02:00:32.229 --> 02:00:32.239 align:start position:0%
alec is a very good organization it is
 
02:00:32.239 --> 02:00:33.669 align:start position:0%
alec is a very good organization it is
nonpartisan

02:00:33.669 --> 02:00:33.679 align:start position:0%
nonpartisan
 
02:00:35.910 --> 02:00:35.920 align:start position:0%
and the issues that they come up that
 
02:00:37.910 --> 02:00:37.920 align:start position:0%
when you say it's a model bill
 
02:00:41.910 --> 02:00:41.920 align:start position:0%
that's the key that this has withstood
 
02:00:43.830 --> 02:00:43.840 align:start position:0%
court challenges
 
02:00:46.310 --> 02:00:46.320 align:start position:0%
in maybe three or four states
 
02:00:47.430 --> 02:00:47.440 align:start position:0%
and so
 
02:00:47.440 --> 02:00:48.629 align:start position:0%
and so
if

02:00:48.629 --> 02:00:48.639 align:start position:0%
if
 
02:00:50.550 --> 02:00:50.560 align:start position:0%
states are similar enough if it's been
 
02:00:52.950 --> 02:00:52.960 align:start position:0%
challenged in four or five states and
 
02:00:55.350 --> 02:00:55.360 align:start position:0%
always prevails i guess we shouldn't
 
02:00:57.030 --> 02:00:57.040 align:start position:0%
have to worry too much about it being
 
02:00:58.629 --> 02:00:58.639 align:start position:0%
challenged if we pass it in new
 
02:01:00.709 --> 02:01:00.719 align:start position:0%
hampshire so i think
 
02:01:02.790 --> 02:01:02.800 align:start position:0%
model builds quite often are a good
 
02:01:04.950 --> 02:01:04.960 align:start position:0%
thing i don't mind telling it's a model
 
02:01:07.109 --> 02:01:07.119 align:start position:0%
built and i wouldn't even mind saying if
 
02:01:08.629 --> 02:01:08.639 align:start position:0%
it came from alec although there are
 
02:01:10.390 --> 02:01:10.400 align:start position:0%
some people that that's an automatic oh
 
02:01:12.629 --> 02:01:12.639 align:start position:0%
i'm voting against it so
 
02:01:14.390 --> 02:01:14.400 align:start position:0%
just my comment here's the pink sheet
 
02:01:15.189 --> 02:01:15.199 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:01:17.990 --> 02:01:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:21.350 --> 02:01:21.360 align:start position:0%
would you accept any questions
 
02:01:23.910 --> 02:01:23.920 align:start position:0%
i think we have one
 
02:01:25.350 --> 02:01:25.360 align:start position:0%
if i'm
 
02:01:25.360 --> 02:01:26.470 align:start position:0%
if i'm
yeah

02:01:26.470 --> 02:01:26.480 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
02:01:27.910 --> 02:01:27.920 align:start position:0%
i'm gonna wait for you to get back to
 
02:01:32.149 --> 02:01:32.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:35.589 --> 02:01:35.599 align:start position:0%
and thank you for sitting back down um
 
02:01:37.589 --> 02:01:37.599 align:start position:0%
so i didn't really get are you opposed
 
02:01:39.350 --> 02:01:39.360 align:start position:0%
to this bill or are you
 
02:01:40.629 --> 02:01:40.639 align:start position:0%
in favor of it
 
02:01:43.030 --> 02:01:43.040 align:start position:0%
i'm opposed that you know it has it has
 
02:01:45.910 --> 02:01:45.920 align:start position:0%
to be made a big deal out of it
 
02:01:49.189 --> 02:01:49.199 align:start position:0%
if it's appropriate for the bill to say
 
02:01:53.030 --> 02:01:53.040 align:start position:0%
yes this has stood the challenges
 
02:01:54.790 --> 02:01:54.800 align:start position:0%
in five other states
 
02:01:57.830 --> 02:01:57.840 align:start position:0%
and so i'm bringing the same model that
 
02:01:59.669 --> 02:01:59.679 align:start position:0%
was originally introduced in such and
 
02:02:02.709 --> 02:02:02.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:02.719 --> 02:02:03.589 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:02:03.589 --> 02:02:03.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:02:06.390 --> 02:02:06.400 align:start position:0%
which brings me to my next question you
 
02:02:08.070 --> 02:02:08.080 align:start position:0%
said that
 
02:02:10.149 --> 02:02:10.159 align:start position:0%
court challenges in four to five other
 
02:02:10.159 --> 02:02:11.189 align:start position:0%
court challenges in four to five other
states

02:02:11.189 --> 02:02:11.199 align:start position:0%
states
 
02:02:14.229 --> 02:02:14.239 align:start position:0%
court challenges to what whether or not
 
02:02:16.070 --> 02:02:16.080 align:start position:0%
they have to put that it's model
 
02:02:18.790 --> 02:02:18.800 align:start position:0%
legislation on legislation or the bill
 
02:02:21.109 --> 02:02:21.119 align:start position:0%
itself has withstood
 
02:02:22.709 --> 02:02:22.719 align:start position:0%
challenges the bill i would be
 
02:02:22.719 --> 02:02:24.470 align:start position:0%
challenges the bill i would be
introducing

02:02:24.470 --> 02:02:24.480 align:start position:0%
introducing
 
02:02:26.550 --> 02:02:26.560 align:start position:0%
i'd say this bill was introduced first
 
02:02:27.669 --> 02:02:27.679 align:start position:0%
in ohio
 
02:02:30.310 --> 02:02:30.320 align:start position:0%
it was challenged in court
 
02:02:32.629 --> 02:02:32.639 align:start position:0%
several other states decided to copy it
 
02:02:34.390 --> 02:02:34.400 align:start position:0%
as a model
 
02:02:36.070 --> 02:02:36.080 align:start position:0%
and it's been challenged in four other
 
02:02:36.080 --> 02:02:37.030 align:start position:0%
and it's been challenged in four other
states

02:02:37.030 --> 02:02:37.040 align:start position:0%
states
 
02:02:38.870 --> 02:02:38.880 align:start position:0%
and it's always prevailed
 
02:02:40.790 --> 02:02:40.800 align:start position:0%
so therefore i'm fairly confident that
 
02:02:42.550 --> 02:02:42.560 align:start position:0%
introducing it in new hampshire is
 
02:02:44.229 --> 02:02:44.239 align:start position:0%
somewhat bulletproof
 
02:02:46.470 --> 02:02:46.480 align:start position:0%
and not not to say
 
02:02:47.990 --> 02:02:48.000 align:start position:0%
challenge whether or not we have to say
 
02:02:50.310 --> 02:02:50.320 align:start position:0%
it's a model legislation but if it's
 
02:02:53.030 --> 02:02:53.040 align:start position:0%
appropriate to the context
 
02:02:56.310 --> 02:02:56.320 align:start position:0%
then i see no harm in introducing why
 
02:02:58.629 --> 02:02:58.639 align:start position:0%
it's a model bill and why it has stood
 
02:03:00.950 --> 02:03:00.960 align:start position:0%
the challenges
 
02:03:02.709 --> 02:03:02.719 align:start position:0%
but i don't think we need to force
 
02:03:04.310 --> 02:03:04.320 align:start position:0%
someone to say because
 
02:03:06.310 --> 02:03:06.320 align:start position:0%
you'll say well i got it from a
 
02:03:08.149 --> 02:03:08.159 align:start position:0%
colleague in ohio
 
02:03:12.550 --> 02:03:12.560 align:start position:0%
yes but what is a model a bill from alec
 
02:03:14.629 --> 02:03:14.639 align:start position:0%
so what
 
02:03:16.550 --> 02:03:16.560 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:03:18.390 --> 02:03:18.400 align:start position:0%
thank you for the questions
 
02:03:19.669 --> 02:03:19.679 align:start position:0%
seeing none
 
02:03:21.589 --> 02:03:21.599 align:start position:0%
you might as well just stay there all
 
02:03:23.270 --> 02:03:23.280 align:start position:0%

department of state
 
02:04:12.870 --> 02:04:12.880 align:start position:0%
so you'll need a copy of the audit and a
 
02:04:15.109 --> 02:04:15.119 align:start position:0%
copy of my testimony
 
02:04:27.589 --> 02:04:27.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:41.430 --> 02:04:41.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:43.430 --> 02:04:43.440 align:start position:0%
i think we're set
 
02:04:45.589 --> 02:04:45.599 align:start position:0%
when you are i'll direct your attention
 
02:04:48.390 --> 02:04:48.400 align:start position:0%
to the table of contents
 
02:04:48.400 --> 02:04:49.510 align:start position:0%
to the table of contents
on

02:04:49.510 --> 02:04:49.520 align:start position:0%
on
 
02:04:54.870 --> 02:04:54.880 align:start position:0%
the page there um lower case i twice
 
02:04:56.709 --> 02:04:56.719 align:start position:0%
and you'll see
 
02:04:58.870 --> 02:04:58.880 align:start position:0%
compliance comments significant
 
02:05:01.350 --> 02:05:01.360 align:start position:0%

02:05:06.390 --> 02:05:06.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:08.790 --> 02:05:08.800 align:start position:0%
layout to the way the audits come to us
 
02:05:11.030 --> 02:05:11.040 align:start position:0%
on the fiscal committee
 
02:05:13.669 --> 02:05:13.679 align:start position:0%
and you'll see number 10 has an asterisk
 
02:05:16.709 --> 02:05:16.719 align:start position:0%
and number 13 has an asterisk and you go
 
02:05:19.109 --> 02:05:19.119 align:start position:0%
to the next bottom the next page
 
02:05:21.750 --> 02:05:21.760 align:start position:0%
where it says audit comment suggests
 
02:05:24.870 --> 02:05:24.880 align:start position:0%
legislative action may be required
 
02:05:26.310 --> 02:05:26.320 align:start position:0%
i'm letting the
 
02:05:28.870 --> 02:05:28.880 align:start position:0%
secretary of state go through number 10
 
02:05:31.030 --> 02:05:31.040 align:start position:0%
with gel car
 
02:05:33.910 --> 02:05:33.920 align:start position:0%
but for you and i we have to go to page
 
02:05:33.920 --> 02:05:40.790 align:start position:0%
but for you and i we have to go to page
21.

02:05:40.790 --> 02:05:40.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:42.950 --> 02:05:42.960 align:start position:0%
where we see
 
02:05:45.669 --> 02:05:45.679 align:start position:0%
a fairly minor comment
 
02:05:47.350 --> 02:05:47.360 align:start position:0%
the department has not kept current
 
02:05:49.430 --> 02:05:49.440 align:start position:0%
certain statutes under purview based on
 
02:05:53.350 --> 02:05:53.360 align:start position:0%
changing conditions described below
 
02:05:55.510 --> 02:05:55.520 align:start position:0%
and then it goes commission
 
02:05:58.550 --> 02:05:58.560 align:start position:0%

02:06:00.709 --> 02:06:00.719 align:start position:0%

02:06:02.390 --> 02:06:02.400 align:start position:0%
two of the three entries listed in the
 
02:06:04.069 --> 02:06:04.079 align:start position:0%

02:06:05.510 --> 02:06:05.520 align:start position:0%
commission and the joint board of
 
02:06:07.910 --> 02:06:07.920 align:start position:0%

entity
 
02:06:14.310 --> 02:06:14.320 align:start position:0%
but then
 
02:06:17.830 --> 02:06:17.840 align:start position:0%
the amendment they gave me
 
02:06:20.149 --> 02:06:20.159 align:start position:0%
when i read it it still has
 
02:06:20.159 --> 02:06:21.189 align:start position:0%

not

the original bill rather not the

02:06:24.229 --> 02:06:24.239 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
02:06:27.350 --> 02:06:27.360 align:start position:0%

02:06:32.390 --> 02:06:32.400 align:start position:0%
attachment
 
02:06:32.400 --> 02:06:35.109 align:start position:0%
attachment
um

02:06:35.109 --> 02:06:35.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:37.830 --> 02:06:37.840 align:start position:0%
okay here it is 1102.
 
02:06:43.750 --> 02:06:43.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:43.760 --> 02:06:45.510 align:start position:0%
 
attached

02:06:45.510 --> 02:06:45.520 align:start position:0%
attached
 
02:06:45.520 --> 02:06:46.629 align:start position:0%
attached
which

02:06:46.629 --> 02:06:46.639 align:start position:0%
which
 
02:06:49.270 --> 02:06:49.280 align:start position:0%
this section says they're not
 
02:06:52.870 --> 02:06:52.880 align:start position:0%
so the amendment removes them
 
02:06:54.629 --> 02:06:54.639 align:start position:0%
uh from
 
02:06:56.790 --> 02:06:56.800 align:start position:0%
that section of
 
02:06:56.800 --> 02:06:59.430 align:start position:0%
that section of
1102.

02:06:59.430 --> 02:06:59.440 align:start position:0%
1102.
 
02:07:01.430 --> 02:07:01.440 align:start position:0%
and it gives a little more information
 
02:07:02.870 --> 02:07:02.880 align:start position:0%
boxing and wrestling commission
 
02:07:05.830 --> 02:07:05.840 align:start position:0%
interestingly enough
 
02:07:07.270 --> 02:07:07.280 align:start position:0%
when we've
 
02:07:09.990 --> 02:07:10.000 align:start position:0%
talked to them briefly in
 
02:07:10.000 --> 02:07:11.350 align:start position:0%
talked to them briefly in
in

02:07:11.350 --> 02:07:11.360 align:start position:0%
in
 
02:07:11.360 --> 02:07:13.430 align:start position:0%
in
budgeting

02:07:13.430 --> 02:07:13.440 align:start position:0%
budgeting
 
02:07:15.030 --> 02:07:15.040 align:start position:0%
they don't have a they don't have any
 
02:07:17.030 --> 02:07:17.040 align:start position:0%
general funds
 
02:07:20.629 --> 02:07:20.639 align:start position:0%
they exist on filing fees
 
02:07:23.510 --> 02:07:23.520 align:start position:0%
and my son is a big boxing
 
02:07:26.310 --> 02:07:26.320 align:start position:0%
fan he'll send me occasional listings
 
02:07:27.910 --> 02:07:27.920 align:start position:0%
that there's going to be a boxing match
 
02:07:29.589 --> 02:07:29.599 align:start position:0%
in manchester
 
02:07:30.950 --> 02:07:30.960 align:start position:0%
there's probably three or four of those
 
02:07:31.990 --> 02:07:32.000 align:start position:0%
a year
 
02:07:33.350 --> 02:07:33.360 align:start position:0%
so the the
 
02:07:35.350 --> 02:07:35.360 align:start position:0%
people that arrange for that have to
 
02:07:38.830 --> 02:07:38.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:41.510 --> 02:07:41.520 align:start position:0%
um a permit from the boxing and
 
02:07:42.870 --> 02:07:42.880 align:start position:0%
wrestling commission and make all the
 
02:07:44.709 --> 02:07:44.719 align:start position:0%
arrangements and of course have the the
 
02:07:44.719 --> 02:07:46.790 align:start position:0%
arrangements and of course have the the
proper

02:07:46.790 --> 02:07:46.800 align:start position:0%
proper
 
02:07:49.669 --> 02:07:49.679 align:start position:0%
agencies that are sponsoring so
 
02:07:51.830 --> 02:07:51.840 align:start position:0%
they take care of that and then we don't
 
02:07:54.149 --> 02:07:54.159 align:start position:0%
need to worry much about it but there's
 
02:07:55.430 --> 02:07:55.440 align:start position:0%
no reason to have them attached to the
 
02:07:57.270 --> 02:07:57.280 align:start position:0%
secretary of state so
 
02:07:59.189 --> 02:07:59.199 align:start position:0%
we've cleaned up the language that was
 
02:08:00.950 --> 02:08:00.960 align:start position:0%
in the original
 
02:08:03.430 --> 02:08:03.440 align:start position:0%
1102 with this amendment
 
02:08:03.440 --> 02:08:05.189 align:start position:0%
1102 with this amendment
and

02:08:05.189 --> 02:08:05.199 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:08:06.629 --> 02:08:06.639 align:start position:0%
the rest of it
 
02:08:09.430 --> 02:08:09.440 align:start position:0%
appears to be
 
02:08:12.229 --> 02:08:12.239 align:start position:0%
accurate especially where we read them
 
02:08:15.830 --> 02:08:15.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:17.830 --> 02:08:17.840 align:start position:0%
grants review committee
 
02:08:20.149 --> 02:08:20.159 align:start position:0%
and i read the detail on that i had all
 
02:08:21.750 --> 02:08:21.760 align:start position:0%
sorts of people that were appointed by
 
02:08:23.589 --> 02:08:23.599 align:start position:0%
this agency that agency this and so and
 
02:08:23.599 --> 02:08:24.310 align:start position:0%
this agency that agency this and so and
so

02:08:24.310 --> 02:08:24.320 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:08:25.510 --> 02:08:25.520 align:start position:0%
then it says
 
02:08:28.069 --> 02:08:28.079 align:start position:0%
the legislature never funded the program
 
02:08:29.750 --> 02:08:29.760 align:start position:0%
and the grants review committee doesn't
 
02:08:29.760 --> 02:08:31.669 align:start position:0%
and the grants review committee doesn't
exist

02:08:31.669 --> 02:08:31.679 align:start position:0%
exist
 
02:08:31.679 --> 02:08:32.950 align:start position:0%
exist
so

02:08:32.950 --> 02:08:32.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:08:34.790 --> 02:08:34.800 align:start position:0%
why even have it in the law
 
02:08:37.910 --> 02:08:37.920 align:start position:0%
so that's another reason to remove it
 
02:08:37.920 --> 02:08:39.189 align:start position:0%
so that's another reason to remove it
um

02:08:39.189 --> 02:08:39.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:08:40.950 --> 02:08:40.960 align:start position:0%
along with some of these other things
 
02:08:40.960 --> 02:08:41.990 align:start position:0%
along with some of these other things
that

02:08:41.990 --> 02:08:42.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:08:43.830 --> 02:08:43.840 align:start position:0%
as a result there are no filings and no
 
02:08:45.430 --> 02:08:45.440 align:start position:0%
fees collected
 
02:08:46.950 --> 02:08:46.960 align:start position:0%
so why even have them on the books so
 
02:08:48.950 --> 02:08:48.960 align:start position:0%
this is kind of a nitpicky house pick
 
02:08:48.960 --> 02:08:50.790 align:start position:0%
this is kind of a nitpicky house pick
house

02:08:50.790 --> 02:08:50.800 align:start position:0%
house
 
02:08:52.390 --> 02:08:52.400 align:start position:0%
keeping thing to
 
02:08:55.589 --> 02:08:55.599 align:start position:0%
to pass 1102 as amended
 
02:08:55.599 --> 02:08:56.790 align:start position:0%
to pass 1102 as amended
and

02:08:56.790 --> 02:08:56.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:08:58.950 --> 02:08:58.960 align:start position:0%
the next time they do a
 
02:09:02.229 --> 02:09:02.239 align:start position:0%
but a audit of the
 
02:09:04.069 --> 02:09:04.079 align:start position:0%
department of state they will be happy
 
02:09:04.079 --> 02:09:04.870 align:start position:0%
department of state they will be happy
that

02:09:04.870 --> 02:09:04.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:09:06.790 --> 02:09:06.800 align:start position:0%
these have been cleaned up
 
02:09:06.800 --> 02:09:07.830 align:start position:0%
these have been cleaned up
so

02:09:07.830 --> 02:09:07.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:09:10.149 --> 02:09:10.159 align:start position:0%
that's my testimony and i'm happy to
 
02:09:12.310 --> 02:09:12.320 align:start position:0%
answer any questions and if you want to
 
02:09:14.470 --> 02:09:14.480 align:start position:0%
take some time describe some of this
 
02:09:14.480 --> 02:09:15.669 align:start position:0%
take some time describe some of this
process

02:09:15.669 --> 02:09:15.679 align:start position:0%
process
 
02:09:17.910 --> 02:09:17.920 align:start position:0%
representative um we have a question
 
02:09:19.990 --> 02:09:20.000 align:start position:0%
from representative roulard thank you
 
02:09:22.069 --> 02:09:22.079 align:start position:0%

hi thanks for taking my question i'm
 
02:09:27.189 --> 02:09:27.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:31.750 --> 02:09:31.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:33.669 --> 02:09:33.679 align:start position:0%
the question the the statement begins on
 
02:09:36.149 --> 02:09:36.159 align:start position:0%
line five the ballot law commission
 
02:09:38.069 --> 02:09:38.079 align:start position:0%
shall each function
 
02:09:41.189 --> 02:09:41.199 align:start position:0%
should the word each be removed there
 
02:09:41.199 --> 02:09:42.149 align:start position:0%
should the word each be removed there
yes

02:09:42.149 --> 02:09:42.159 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:09:42.159 --> 02:09:44.069 align:start position:0%
yes
okay

02:09:44.069 --> 02:09:44.079 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:09:47.030 --> 02:09:47.040 align:start position:0%
yep we don't need each in there
 
02:09:49.510 --> 02:09:49.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for catching that
 
02:09:52.550 --> 02:09:52.560 align:start position:0%
hopefully uh that'll go to the drafting
 
02:09:57.109 --> 02:09:57.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:58.830 --> 02:09:58.840 align:start position:0%
that's it
 
02:10:02.709 --> 02:10:02.719 align:start position:0%
um for other questions i have one
 
02:10:06.149 --> 02:10:06.159 align:start position:0%
so my question is um on the original and
 
02:10:07.750 --> 02:10:07.760 align:start position:0%
the amendment
 
02:10:12.069 --> 02:10:12.079 align:start position:0%
um but on the amendment it's line 18
 
02:10:15.910 --> 02:10:15.920 align:start position:0%
and it talks about rsa 652-24
 
02:10:17.750 --> 02:10:17.760 align:start position:0%
relative to voter identification
 
02:10:20.149 --> 02:10:20.159 align:start position:0%
advisory committee
 
02:10:24.229 --> 02:10:24.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:26.550 --> 02:10:26.560 align:start position:0%
in the lba
 
02:10:26.560 --> 02:10:27.589 align:start position:0%
in the lba
report

02:10:27.589 --> 02:10:27.599 align:start position:0%
report
 
02:10:29.109 --> 02:10:29.119 align:start position:0%
or how do i
 
02:10:30.950 --> 02:10:30.960 align:start position:0%
why is that on there i guess is my
 
02:10:30.960 --> 02:10:37.270 align:start position:0%
why is that on there i guess is my
question

02:10:37.270 --> 02:10:37.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:40.310 --> 02:10:40.320 align:start position:0%
i understand the boxing and wrestling
 
02:10:46.550 --> 02:10:46.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:48.390 --> 02:10:48.400 align:start position:0%
why are we repealing the voter
 
02:10:57.270 --> 02:10:57.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:00.629 --> 02:11:00.639 align:start position:0%
unless when i went to see the drafter
 
02:11:03.669 --> 02:11:03.679 align:start position:0%
she went back through it and discovered
 
02:11:05.830 --> 02:11:05.840 align:start position:0%
something else that
 
02:11:11.510 --> 02:11:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:13.189 --> 02:11:13.199 align:start position:0%
maybe she had a conversation with
 
02:11:15.510 --> 02:11:15.520 align:start position:0%
department of state
 
02:11:15.520 --> 02:11:16.709 align:start position:0%
department of state
but

02:11:16.709 --> 02:11:16.719 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:11:18.470 --> 02:11:18.480 align:start position:0%
i didn't know if that was attached to
 
02:11:20.069 --> 02:11:20.079 align:start position:0%
that when you were saying you were
 
02:11:22.470 --> 02:11:22.480 align:start position:0%
allowing the
 
02:11:24.069 --> 02:11:24.079 align:start position:0%
the secretary of state to change some
 
02:11:25.589 --> 02:11:25.599 align:start position:0%
things through rules i didn't know if
 
02:11:29.109 --> 02:11:29.119 align:start position:0%
that was part of this or
 
02:11:33.589 --> 02:11:33.599 align:start position:0%
because there are three repeals shown
 
02:11:36.149 --> 02:11:36.159 align:start position:0%
and they all three carry forward onto
 
02:11:38.870 --> 02:11:38.880 align:start position:0%
the amendment
 
02:11:41.270 --> 02:11:41.280 align:start position:0%
but i'm not sure
 
02:11:43.109 --> 02:11:43.119 align:start position:0%
i'm not actually sure where the real
 
02:11:51.510 --> 02:11:51.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:54.310 --> 02:11:54.320 align:start position:0%
would you be able to follow up with the
 
02:11:58.390 --> 02:11:58.400 align:start position:0%
committee i will do that thank you
 
02:12:03.270 --> 02:12:03.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:05.350 --> 02:12:05.360 align:start position:0%
um would you
 
02:12:08.870 --> 02:12:08.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:11.270 --> 02:12:11.280 align:start position:0%
five minutes um
 
02:12:13.430 --> 02:12:13.440 align:start position:0%
if you would be able to give us a quick
 
02:12:18.149 --> 02:12:18.159 align:start position:0%
overview of the process perhaps
 
02:12:20.390 --> 02:12:20.400 align:start position:0%
sorry new information coming from
 
02:12:20.400 --> 02:12:24.229 align:start position:0%
sorry new information coming from
outside

02:12:24.229 --> 02:12:24.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:24.239 --> 02:12:27.910 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:12:27.910 --> 02:12:27.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:31.030 --> 02:12:31.040 align:start position:0%
eliminating the voter identification oh
 
02:12:31.040 --> 02:12:31.990 align:start position:0%
eliminating the voter identification oh
okay

02:12:31.990 --> 02:12:32.000 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:12:35.589 --> 02:12:35.599 align:start position:0%
we're looking at house bill 1269
 
02:12:37.510 --> 02:12:37.520 align:start position:0%
which is relative to certain legislative
 
02:12:39.750 --> 02:12:39.760 align:start position:0%
study committees which also eliminates
 
02:12:42.550 --> 02:12:42.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:44.790 --> 02:12:44.800 align:start position:0%
roman eight absolutely voter
 
02:12:48.470 --> 02:12:48.480 align:start position:0%
identification advisory board so one way
 
02:12:49.589 --> 02:12:49.599 align:start position:0%
or the other
 
02:12:51.910 --> 02:12:51.920 align:start position:0%
it's coming it's going to be eliminated
 
02:12:53.910 --> 02:12:53.920 align:start position:0%
so maybe that's why the draft to put it
 
02:12:56.149 --> 02:12:56.159 align:start position:0%
in you want me to follow up or just
 
02:12:56.159 --> 02:12:57.430 align:start position:0%
in you want me to follow up or just
um

02:12:57.430 --> 02:12:57.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:12:59.990 --> 02:13:00.000 align:start position:0%
now that we know where it also exists
 
02:13:04.870 --> 02:13:04.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:07.109 --> 02:13:07.119 align:start position:0%
who is who's bringing that bill forward
 
02:13:09.669 --> 02:13:09.679 align:start position:0%
you aren't are they
 
02:13:11.270 --> 02:13:11.280 align:start position:0%
oh karen
 
02:13:14.709 --> 02:13:14.719 align:start position:0%
um okay we'll ask that
 
02:13:18.790 --> 02:13:18.800 align:start position:0%
okay just uh we'll ask at that time
 
02:13:20.709 --> 02:13:20.719 align:start position:0%
maybe it's just a way of doing it i
 
02:13:22.550 --> 02:13:22.560 align:start position:0%
don't know why would it be added to this
 
02:13:23.990 --> 02:13:24.000 align:start position:0%
amendment and not
 
02:13:25.830 --> 02:13:25.840 align:start position:0%
and that would be rafter might have just
 
02:13:28.870 --> 02:13:28.880 align:start position:0%
worked on that recently yeah okay
 
02:13:32.470 --> 02:13:32.480 align:start position:0%
um yes but as far as the audit goes
 
02:13:34.950 --> 02:13:34.960 align:start position:0%
that's before us
 
02:13:37.030 --> 02:13:37.040 align:start position:0%
truthfully the only thing that this
 
02:13:39.030 --> 02:13:39.040 align:start position:0%
pertains to is
 
02:13:39.040 --> 02:13:40.709 align:start position:0%
pertains to is
um

02:13:40.709 --> 02:13:40.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:13:42.470 --> 02:13:42.480 align:start position:0%
is the repeal
 
02:13:47.510 --> 02:13:47.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:47.520 --> 02:13:48.390 align:start position:0%
 
yes

02:13:48.390 --> 02:13:48.400 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:13:50.310 --> 02:13:50.320 align:start position:0%
plus it it takes the boxing and
 
02:13:52.229 --> 02:13:52.239 align:start position:0%
wrestling commission and the
 
02:13:56.310 --> 02:13:56.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:00.310 --> 02:14:00.320 align:start position:0%
right we're not actually repealing
 
02:14:01.750 --> 02:14:01.760 align:start position:0%
that they're just saying they're no
 
02:14:05.189 --> 02:14:05.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:06.229 --> 02:14:06.239 align:start position:0%
they're not
 
02:14:08.790 --> 02:14:08.800 align:start position:0%
they're no longer attached to the
 
02:14:11.109 --> 02:14:11.119 align:start position:0%
secretary of state's office
 
02:14:12.870 --> 02:14:12.880 align:start position:0%
and where are they are they placed
 
02:14:15.189 --> 02:14:15.199 align:start position:0%
somewhere else removal of the joint
 
02:14:17.990 --> 02:14:18.000 align:start position:0%
board of licensure and certification but
 
02:14:18.000 --> 02:14:19.430 align:start position:0%
board of licensure and certification but
where

02:14:19.430 --> 02:14:19.440 align:start position:0%
where
 
02:14:21.109 --> 02:14:21.119 align:start position:0%
where did the boxing and wrestling
 
02:14:22.950 --> 02:14:22.960 align:start position:0%
commission go if they're not attached to
 
02:14:25.990 --> 02:14:26.000 align:start position:0%
the secretary of state's office rsa 285
 
02:14:30.149 --> 02:14:30.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:32.149 --> 02:14:32.159 align:start position:0%
okay i i
 
02:14:33.830 --> 02:14:33.840 align:start position:0%
should have looked at the amendment an
 
02:14:36.709 --> 02:14:36.719 align:start position:0%
independent commission at that point
 
02:14:36.719 --> 02:14:37.990 align:start position:0%
independent commission at that point
okay

02:14:37.990 --> 02:14:38.000 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:14:39.830 --> 02:14:39.840 align:start position:0%
it makes our work easier we don't have
 
02:14:41.990 --> 02:14:42.000 align:start position:0%
to fund them we don't have to
 
02:14:44.390 --> 02:14:44.400 align:start position:0%
worry about who appoints them or any of
 
02:14:45.830 --> 02:14:45.840 align:start position:0%
that stuff so
 
02:14:48.790 --> 02:14:48.800 align:start position:0%
got it anyway to get back to
 
02:14:51.189 --> 02:14:51.199 align:start position:0%
um we have piles of these
 
02:14:51.199 --> 02:14:53.030 align:start position:0%
um we have piles of these
audits

02:14:53.030 --> 02:14:53.040 align:start position:0%
audits
 
02:14:54.550 --> 02:14:54.560 align:start position:0%
we have
 
02:14:54.560 --> 02:14:56.310 align:start position:0%
we have
within

02:14:56.310 --> 02:14:56.320 align:start position:0%
within
 
02:14:56.320 --> 02:14:57.990 align:start position:0%
within
um

02:14:57.990 --> 02:14:58.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:14:59.990 --> 02:15:00.000 align:start position:0%
the legislative
 
02:15:02.069 --> 02:15:02.079 align:start position:0%
offices there is a legislative budget
 
02:15:02.079 --> 02:15:03.990 align:start position:0%
offices there is a legislative budget
assistance

02:15:03.990 --> 02:15:04.000 align:start position:0%
assistance
 
02:15:05.669 --> 02:15:05.679 align:start position:0%
that person works
 
02:15:05.679 --> 02:15:06.790 align:start position:0%
that person works
technically

02:15:06.790 --> 02:15:06.800 align:start position:0%
technically
 
02:15:08.790 --> 02:15:08.800 align:start position:0%
for the fiscal committee
 
02:15:10.470 --> 02:15:10.480 align:start position:0%
and the fiscal committee appoints a
 
02:15:13.669 --> 02:15:13.679 align:start position:0%
legislative budget assistant one person
 
02:15:15.109 --> 02:15:15.119 align:start position:0%
who then appoints
 
02:15:16.629 --> 02:15:16.639 align:start position:0%
staff members
 
02:15:19.189 --> 02:15:19.199 align:start position:0%
there's about eight of them that work
 
02:15:21.750 --> 02:15:21.760 align:start position:0%
with us on the budget they also work
 
02:15:24.709 --> 02:15:24.719 align:start position:0%
with public works and ways and means
 
02:15:24.719 --> 02:15:25.589 align:start position:0%
with public works and ways and means
and

02:15:25.589 --> 02:15:25.599 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:15:30.069 --> 02:15:30.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:32.310 --> 02:15:32.320 align:start position:0%
very good accountants
 
02:15:33.910 --> 02:15:33.920 align:start position:0%
they also have
 
02:15:36.390 --> 02:15:36.400 align:start position:0%
an audit division which is down the
 
02:15:36.400 --> 02:15:37.430 align:start position:0%
an audit division which is down the
street

02:15:37.430 --> 02:15:37.440 align:start position:0%
street
 
02:15:38.950 --> 02:15:38.960 align:start position:0%
you usually only see them when they come
 
02:15:40.550 --> 02:15:40.560 align:start position:0%
in and deliver an audit to the fiscal
 
02:15:40.560 --> 02:15:41.990 align:start position:0%
in and deliver an audit to the fiscal
committee

02:15:41.990 --> 02:15:42.000 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:15:44.069 --> 02:15:44.079 align:start position:0%
those on the fiscal committee may decide
 
02:15:46.229 --> 02:15:46.239 align:start position:0%
well this is worth sending to some other
 
02:15:47.910 --> 02:15:47.920 align:start position:0%
committee if it's like fish and game
 
02:15:48.870 --> 02:15:48.880 align:start position:0%
yeah we ought to send it to fish
 
02:15:50.629 --> 02:15:50.639 align:start position:0%
efficient game let the members of that
 
02:15:52.629 --> 02:15:52.639 align:start position:0%
committee read all about what they found
 
02:15:53.830 --> 02:15:53.840 align:start position:0%
in the audit
 
02:15:57.030 --> 02:15:57.040 align:start position:0%
they do both financial audits and
 
02:15:58.870 --> 02:15:58.880 align:start position:0%
they do those trying to do those on a
 
02:16:01.350 --> 02:16:01.360 align:start position:0%
rotating five-year basis
 
02:16:03.830 --> 02:16:03.840 align:start position:0%
and they also do performance audits and
 
02:16:05.910 --> 02:16:05.920 align:start position:0%
there is a subcommittee of the
 
02:16:07.910 --> 02:16:07.920 align:start position:0%
legislature that is a legislative
 
02:16:10.390 --> 02:16:10.400 align:start position:0%
performance audit oversight committee
 
02:16:12.629 --> 02:16:12.639 align:start position:0%
and those eight people or so i think
 
02:16:15.109 --> 02:16:15.119 align:start position:0%
it's four house and four senate
 
02:16:17.430 --> 02:16:17.440 align:start position:0%
get together occasionally and say
 
02:16:19.030 --> 02:16:19.040 align:start position:0%
you know we need to do a performance
 
02:16:20.470 --> 02:16:20.480 align:start position:0%
audit on such and such because
 
02:16:22.550 --> 02:16:22.560 align:start position:0%
something's come up to say
 
02:16:25.510 --> 02:16:25.520 align:start position:0%
oh look at all the abuses in
 
02:16:28.470 --> 02:16:28.480 align:start position:0%
in the department of children and youth
 
02:16:31.030 --> 02:16:31.040 align:start position:0%
let's do a performance audit over there
 
02:16:32.150 --> 02:16:32.160 align:start position:0%
and they'll come in and they'll do a
 
02:16:33.509 --> 02:16:33.519 align:start position:0%
very thorough one they'll look at the
 
02:16:35.190 --> 02:16:35.200 align:start position:0%
way things are done in other states
 
02:16:36.709 --> 02:16:36.719 align:start position:0%
they'll look at what the best management
 
02:16:39.030 --> 02:16:39.040 align:start position:0%
practices are they'll likely publish
 
02:16:40.629 --> 02:16:40.639 align:start position:0%
them they'll probably put some history
 
02:16:43.190 --> 02:16:43.200 align:start position:0%
in there and so on and so forth and it's
 
02:16:44.549 --> 02:16:44.559 align:start position:0%
a very thorough thing and there's a
 
02:16:47.110 --> 02:16:47.120 align:start position:0%
different group that works on
 
02:16:49.190 --> 02:16:49.200 align:start position:0%
performance audits and they have mbas
 
02:16:51.110 --> 02:16:51.120 align:start position:0%
versus cpas
 
02:16:51.990 --> 02:16:52.000 align:start position:0%
and so
 
02:16:55.030 --> 02:16:55.040 align:start position:0%
it's uh it's very instructive when you
 
02:16:57.270 --> 02:16:57.280 align:start position:0%
want to find out something about
 
02:16:59.030 --> 02:16:59.040 align:start position:0%
a particular function of state
 
02:17:00.709 --> 02:17:00.719 align:start position:0%
government and it
 
02:17:02.389 --> 02:17:02.399 align:start position:0%
is always very enlightening when i read
 
02:17:04.790 --> 02:17:04.800 align:start position:0%
those things and sometimes it
 
02:17:07.110 --> 02:17:07.120 align:start position:0%
again has little asterisks or sometimes
 
02:17:08.230 --> 02:17:08.240 align:start position:0%
they have a
 
02:17:09.589 --> 02:17:09.599 align:start position:0%
they do it in a different format
 
02:17:11.750 --> 02:17:11.760 align:start position:0%
depending who the auditor is sometimes
 
02:17:13.830 --> 02:17:13.840 align:start position:0%
you'll see it in a table format and
 
02:17:16.950 --> 02:17:16.960 align:start position:0%
they'll say legislative needed yes no
 
02:17:18.709 --> 02:17:18.719 align:start position:0%
you go down that and so
 
02:17:20.709 --> 02:17:20.719 align:start position:0%
we take that as a guideline on fiscal
 
02:17:20.719 --> 02:17:22.389 align:start position:0%
we take that as a guideline on fiscal
committee

02:17:22.389 --> 02:17:22.399 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:17:25.669 --> 02:17:25.679 align:start position:0%
what should we put in as legislation so
 
02:17:27.669 --> 02:17:27.679 align:start position:0%
it became more complicated than i
 
02:17:29.429 --> 02:17:29.439 align:start position:0%
realized because
 
02:17:32.230 --> 02:17:32.240 align:start position:0%
someone didn't read it exactly right
 
02:17:34.230 --> 02:17:34.240 align:start position:0%
we have a question would you take a
 
02:17:36.070 --> 02:17:36.080 align:start position:0%
question from representative roulard of
 
02:17:36.080 --> 02:17:37.429 align:start position:0%
question from representative roulard of
course

02:17:37.429 --> 02:17:37.439 align:start position:0%
course
 
02:17:38.950 --> 02:17:38.960 align:start position:0%
sometimes it takes me a bit to read it
 
02:17:41.349 --> 02:17:41.359 align:start position:0%
before i can come up with my questions
 
02:17:43.030 --> 02:17:43.040 align:start position:0%
your amendment
 
02:17:46.230 --> 02:17:46.240 align:start position:0%
actually does
 
02:17:46.240 --> 02:17:47.349 align:start position:0%
actually does
keep

02:17:47.349 --> 02:17:47.359 align:start position:0%
keep
 
02:17:49.110 --> 02:17:49.120 align:start position:0%
the establishment of the commission for
 
02:17:52.230 --> 02:17:52.240 align:start position:0%
boxing and wrestling under 285
 
02:17:56.469 --> 02:17:56.479 align:start position:0%
i don't see an end date to that so will
 
02:17:59.190 --> 02:17:59.200 align:start position:0%
that commission go on
 
02:17:59.200 --> 02:18:01.830 align:start position:0%
that commission go on
forever

02:18:01.830 --> 02:18:01.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:03.270 --> 02:18:03.280 align:start position:0%
i would assume so
 
02:18:05.270 --> 02:18:05.280 align:start position:0%
if we don't show an end date and and you
 
02:18:06.629 --> 02:18:06.639 align:start position:0%
think that that's an appropriate thing
 
02:18:08.950 --> 02:18:08.960 align:start position:0%
that it should go on forever
 
02:18:10.709 --> 02:18:10.719 align:start position:0%
as long as people are willing to pay
 
02:18:12.389 --> 02:18:12.399 align:start position:0%
money to go and watch boxing and
 
02:18:12.399 --> 02:18:13.509 align:start position:0%
money to go and watch boxing and
wrestling

02:18:13.509 --> 02:18:13.519 align:start position:0%
wrestling
 
02:18:14.790 --> 02:18:14.800 align:start position:0%
we're going to have to have somebody
 
02:18:16.629 --> 02:18:16.639 align:start position:0%
that's going to certify them and allow
 
02:18:18.309 --> 02:18:18.319 align:start position:0%
it and
 
02:18:19.589 --> 02:18:19.599 align:start position:0%
permit it
 
02:18:20.870 --> 02:18:20.880 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
02:18:22.309 --> 02:18:22.319 align:start position:0%
so the commission
 
02:18:26.230 --> 02:18:26.240 align:start position:0%
is actually a certifying
 
02:18:26.240 --> 02:18:27.830 align:start position:0%
is actually a certifying
board

02:18:27.830 --> 02:18:27.840 align:start position:0%
board
 
02:18:27.840 --> 02:18:28.629 align:start position:0%
board
yeah

02:18:28.629 --> 02:18:28.639 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
02:18:30.309 --> 02:18:30.319 align:start position:0%
you couldn't just have anybody come in
 
02:18:32.070 --> 02:18:32.080 align:start position:0%
and say hey i got two guys they want to
 
02:18:35.030 --> 02:18:35.040 align:start position:0%
start boxing and and uh you know i've
 
02:18:36.230 --> 02:18:36.240 align:start position:0%
got the
 
02:18:38.230 --> 02:18:38.240 align:start position:0%
space reserved and i'm selling tickets
 
02:18:40.070 --> 02:18:40.080 align:start position:0%
and so on so wait a minute
 
02:18:42.070 --> 02:18:42.080 align:start position:0%
who's the uh
 
02:18:44.469 --> 02:18:44.479 align:start position:0%
who's the overall
 
02:18:45.830 --> 02:18:45.840 align:start position:0%
group that's
 
02:18:47.190 --> 02:18:47.200 align:start position:0%
sanctioning them
 
02:18:48.150 --> 02:18:48.160 align:start position:0%
is there
 
02:18:49.830 --> 02:18:49.840 align:start position:0%
a definite group
 
02:18:52.230 --> 02:18:52.240 align:start position:0%
that will recognize who gets the belt or
 
02:18:54.469 --> 02:18:54.479 align:start position:0%
the championship or whatever
 
02:18:56.309 --> 02:18:56.319 align:start position:0%
you don't just have
 
02:18:59.349 --> 02:18:59.359 align:start position:0%
a boxing club decides to put on a match
 
02:19:01.509 --> 02:19:01.519 align:start position:0%
you need some sanctioning from some
 
02:19:02.950 --> 02:19:02.960 align:start position:0%
official body
 
02:19:04.230 --> 02:19:04.240 align:start position:0%
that this
 
02:19:05.990 --> 02:19:06.000 align:start position:0%
boxing and wrestling commission we'll
 
02:19:08.790 --> 02:19:08.800 align:start position:0%
keep track of that
 
02:19:10.389 --> 02:19:10.399 align:start position:0%
follow-up so that question came from
 
02:19:12.070 --> 02:19:12.080 align:start position:0%
somebody that doesn't watch boxing or
 
02:19:16.150 --> 02:19:16.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:19.750 --> 02:19:19.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:21.830 --> 02:19:21.840 align:start position:0%
let's do that
 
02:19:23.509 --> 02:19:23.519 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your testimony i
 
02:19:26.309 --> 02:19:26.319 align:start position:0%
think we're all set okay thank you
 
02:19:26.319 --> 02:19:27.190 align:start position:0%
think we're all set okay thank you
um

02:19:27.190 --> 02:19:27.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:19:28.870 --> 02:19:28.880 align:start position:0%
so i guess we don't need to further them
 
02:19:30.309 --> 02:19:30.319 align:start position:0%
in we'll just
 
02:19:32.709 --> 02:19:32.719 align:start position:0%
i think i think we're set the only thing
 
02:19:36.629 --> 02:19:36.639 align:start position:0%
is that word each but um
 
02:19:39.190 --> 02:19:39.200 align:start position:0%
we can we can touch that up before we
 
02:19:43.910 --> 02:19:43.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:43.920 --> 02:19:44.870 align:start position:0%
 
yes

02:19:44.870 --> 02:19:44.880 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:19:46.870 --> 02:19:46.880 align:start position:0%
representative berger pointed out where
 
02:19:48.790 --> 02:19:48.800 align:start position:0%
it'll be taken care of
 
02:19:50.550 --> 02:19:50.560 align:start position:0%
later today right
 
02:19:50.560 --> 02:19:51.670 align:start position:0%
later today right
yes

02:19:51.670 --> 02:19:51.680 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:19:51.680 --> 02:19:53.429 align:start position:0%
yes
theoretically

02:19:53.429 --> 02:19:53.439 align:start position:0%
theoretically
 
02:19:56.870 --> 02:19:56.880 align:start position:0%
thank you all all right thank you
 
02:20:02.309 --> 02:20:02.319 align:start position:0%

02:20:02.319 --> 02:20:04.550 align:start position:0%
uh with that i will close the hearing on

this bill is
 
02:20:56.590 --> 02:20:56.600 align:start position:0%
well it was somewhat duplicated by hb
 
02:20:59.910 --> 02:20:59.920 align:start position:0%
1650 which we uh
 
02:21:02.070 --> 02:21:02.080 align:start position:0%
which they fast-tracked was one of the
 
02:21:04.870 --> 02:21:04.880 align:start position:0%
first things we voted on when we had our
 
02:21:07.670 --> 02:21:07.680 align:start position:0%
two-day session at the doubletree hotel
 
02:21:07.680 --> 02:21:09.510 align:start position:0%
two-day session at the doubletree hotel
i

02:21:09.510 --> 02:21:09.520 align:start position:0%
i
 
02:21:11.590 --> 02:21:11.600 align:start position:0%
i asked for this bill drafted uh long
 
02:21:13.429 --> 02:21:13.439 align:start position:0%
before i knew we'd be meeting in january
 
02:21:15.590 --> 02:21:15.600 align:start position:0%
at the doubletree hotel although i was
 
02:21:17.190 --> 02:21:17.200 align:start position:0%
not surprised that we're meeting or
 
02:21:19.190 --> 02:21:19.200 align:start position:0%
convening somewhere other than the state
 
02:21:22.230 --> 02:21:22.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:23.910 --> 02:21:23.920 align:start position:0%
the main difference between what i
 
02:21:26.389 --> 02:21:26.399 align:start position:0%
proposed was first of all i didn't
 
02:21:27.910 --> 02:21:27.920 align:start position:0%
get into
 
02:21:27.920 --> 02:21:28.870 align:start position:0%
get into
uh

02:21:28.870 --> 02:21:28.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:21:30.950 --> 02:21:30.960 align:start position:0%
they also amended a couple of uh
 
02:21:32.950 --> 02:21:32.960 align:start position:0%
paragraphs that came after the main part
 
02:21:36.550 --> 02:21:36.560 align:start position:0%
that my bill my bill amended
 
02:21:38.309 --> 02:21:38.319 align:start position:0%
about uh
 
02:21:38.319 --> 02:21:39.429 align:start position:0%
about uh
submitting

02:21:39.429 --> 02:21:39.439 align:start position:0%
submitting
 
02:21:41.429 --> 02:21:41.439 align:start position:0%
we're officially even though like they
 
02:21:42.950 --> 02:21:42.960 align:start position:0%
do the computations for us we're
 
02:21:45.190 --> 02:21:45.200 align:start position:0%
officially supposed to like
 
02:21:46.630 --> 02:21:46.640 align:start position:0%
the log time implies we're supposed to
 
02:21:48.230 --> 02:21:48.240 align:start position:0%
calculate ourselves and then submit a
 
02:21:51.670 --> 02:21:51.680 align:start position:0%
report and then they approve it but um
 
02:21:54.230 --> 02:21:54.240 align:start position:0%
and then also the verb i used is my
 
02:21:57.750 --> 02:21:57.760 align:start position:0%
build uses difference i talk about
 
02:21:59.830 --> 02:21:59.840 align:start position:0%
any other location where the house
 
02:22:01.750 --> 02:22:01.760 align:start position:0%
senator both bodies in the joint session
 
02:22:03.190 --> 02:22:03.200 align:start position:0%
are meeting
 
02:22:04.870 --> 02:22:04.880 align:start position:0%
and then this one says
 
02:22:04.880 --> 02:22:06.630 align:start position:0%
and then this one says
where

02:22:06.630 --> 02:22:06.640 align:start position:0%
where
 
02:22:08.230 --> 02:22:08.240 align:start position:0%
the phrase they use in the same places
 
02:22:10.950 --> 02:22:10.960 align:start position:0%
as of january 1st 2022
 
02:22:12.950 --> 02:22:12.960 align:start position:0%
any location where the member bodies
 
02:22:16.309 --> 02:22:16.319 align:start position:0%
convened and um
 
02:22:17.990 --> 02:22:18.000 align:start position:0%
i was an english major in college even
 
02:22:19.510 --> 02:22:19.520 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure the exact difference
 
02:22:21.429 --> 02:22:21.439 align:start position:0%
between meeting and convening is
 
02:22:23.670 --> 02:22:23.680 align:start position:0%
although it seems to me
 
02:22:26.630 --> 02:22:26.640 align:start position:0%
in january 5th through 6th we were
 
02:22:28.630 --> 02:22:28.640 align:start position:0%
the state legislature was probably still
 
02:22:30.550 --> 02:22:30.560 align:start position:0%
convened at the state house that was
 
02:22:32.230 --> 02:22:32.240 align:start position:0%
where the that's where the speaker's
 
02:22:33.990 --> 02:22:34.000 align:start position:0%
office is and the clerk's office located
 
02:22:35.670 --> 02:22:35.680 align:start position:0%
we were just meeting
 
02:22:37.670 --> 02:22:37.680 align:start position:0%
we were just assembling off-site so
 
02:22:38.870 --> 02:22:38.880 align:start position:0%
whether we're
 
02:22:40.230 --> 02:22:40.240 align:start position:0%
whether we actually convened in
 
02:22:41.990 --> 02:22:42.000 align:start position:0%
manchester those two days just you know
 
02:22:43.510 --> 02:22:43.520 align:start position:0%
you can kind of quibble with that but
 
02:22:45.349 --> 02:22:45.359 align:start position:0%
either um
 
02:22:47.110 --> 02:22:47.120 align:start position:0%
probably like uh
 
02:22:50.710 --> 02:22:50.720 align:start position:0%
either one either phrase serves to uh
 
02:22:52.870 --> 02:22:52.880 align:start position:0%
first authorize uh what we actually did
 
02:22:54.710 --> 02:22:54.720 align:start position:0%
which was to pay pay us all for our
 
02:22:57.270 --> 02:22:57.280 align:start position:0%
mileage from our homes to the doubletree
 
02:23:00.469 --> 02:23:00.479 align:start position:0%
hotel or in the past unh or the sports
 
02:23:00.479 --> 02:23:02.150 align:start position:0%
hotel or in the past unh or the sports
dome

02:23:02.150 --> 02:23:02.160 align:start position:0%
dome
 
02:23:02.160 --> 02:23:02.830 align:start position:0%
dome
and

02:23:02.830 --> 02:23:02.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:23:02.840 --> 02:23:04.550 align:start position:0%
and
um

02:23:04.550 --> 02:23:04.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:23:06.150 --> 02:23:06.160 align:start position:0%
and uh actually probably there's a
 
02:23:07.270 --> 02:23:07.280 align:start position:0%
little bit of ambiguity in the law
 
02:23:09.590 --> 02:23:09.600 align:start position:0%
because certainly having uh committee
 
02:23:11.670 --> 02:23:11.680 align:start position:0%
hearings off-site is not entirely
 
02:23:13.429 --> 02:23:13.439 align:start position:0%
unheard of like the budget committee
 
02:23:15.030 --> 02:23:15.040 align:start position:0%
well they didn't do it this budget cycle
 
02:23:16.389 --> 02:23:16.399 align:start position:0%
but past budget cycles they've
 
02:23:18.870 --> 02:23:18.880 align:start position:0%
traditionally had a few uh
 
02:23:20.469 --> 02:23:20.479 align:start position:0%
meetings at various locations on the
 
02:23:21.830 --> 02:23:21.840 align:start position:0%
stage and we've always been paying them
 
02:23:24.150 --> 02:23:24.160 align:start position:0%
the mileage
 
02:23:26.630 --> 02:23:26.640 align:start position:0%
the committee members and other
 
02:23:29.670 --> 02:23:29.680 align:start position:0%
other reps who show out the mileage from
 
02:23:31.750 --> 02:23:31.760 align:start position:0%
where they live to the location not to
 
02:23:33.910 --> 02:23:33.920 align:start position:0%
conquered and
 
02:23:35.590 --> 02:23:35.600 align:start position:0%
then one really
 
02:23:37.429 --> 02:23:37.439 align:start position:0%
nitpicky thing
 
02:23:40.230 --> 02:23:40.240 align:start position:0%
is that i notice here that if
 
02:23:42.389 --> 02:23:42.399 align:start position:0%
one legislative chamber is convening or
 
02:23:44.070 --> 02:23:44.080 align:start position:0%
meeting depending how looking the other
 
02:23:44.080 --> 02:23:45.349 align:start position:0%
meeting depending how looking the other
isn't

02:23:45.349 --> 02:23:45.359 align:start position:0%
isn't
 
02:23:47.190 --> 02:23:47.200 align:start position:0%
according to my proposal if a member of
 
02:23:49.590 --> 02:23:49.600 align:start position:0%
the body that's not convened or not
 
02:23:52.070 --> 02:23:52.080 align:start position:0%
meeting chooses a drive to the session
 
02:23:53.670 --> 02:23:53.680 align:start position:0%
day to observe or for whatever other
 
02:23:55.429 --> 02:23:55.439 align:start position:0%
reason they might want to go they would
 
02:23:57.030 --> 02:23:57.040 align:start position:0%
still automatically get the mileage
 
02:23:58.950 --> 02:23:58.960 align:start position:0%
whereas uh
 
02:24:01.910 --> 02:24:01.920 align:start position:0%
in the proposal hb 1650 which we
 
02:24:03.670 --> 02:24:03.680 align:start position:0%
actually passed in the law
 
02:24:05.670 --> 02:24:05.680 align:start position:0%
a couple weeks ago uh
 
02:24:07.830 --> 02:24:07.840 align:start position:0%
you can only get paid mileage for
 
02:24:09.270 --> 02:24:09.280 align:start position:0%
going to your
 
02:24:12.070 --> 02:24:12.080 align:start position:0%
going to see for attending a session of
 
02:24:15.110 --> 02:24:15.120 align:start position:0%
your own body so like say if a senator
 
02:24:17.590 --> 02:24:17.600 align:start position:0%
i don't know if any did but i guess my
 
02:24:19.030 --> 02:24:19.040 align:start position:0%
bill passed like safer meeting you know
 
02:24:20.870 --> 02:24:20.880 align:start position:0%
it's a sports dome if the senate was a
 
02:24:22.710 --> 02:24:22.720 align:start position:0%
meeting they could drive down and sit in
 
02:24:24.230 --> 02:24:24.240 align:start position:0%
that little uh
 
02:24:26.389 --> 02:24:26.399 align:start position:0%
sit in that little uh balcony or
 
02:24:28.150 --> 02:24:28.160 align:start position:0%
mezzanine type area over the entrance
 
02:24:29.830 --> 02:24:29.840 align:start position:0%
and watch us and still get their mileage
 
02:24:31.670 --> 02:24:31.680 align:start position:0%
and they
 
02:24:33.190 --> 02:24:33.200 align:start position:0%
probably could have gotten their mileage
 
02:24:34.710 --> 02:24:34.720 align:start position:0%
anyway but
 
02:24:36.230 --> 02:24:36.240 align:start position:0%
so that's um
 
02:24:38.469 --> 02:24:38.479 align:start position:0%
anyway so that that's my bill it's uh
 
02:24:41.590 --> 02:24:41.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:43.830 --> 02:24:43.840 align:start position:0%
so if you see some value to using my
 
02:24:45.349 --> 02:24:45.359 align:start position:0%
wording i would be
 
02:24:47.030 --> 02:24:47.040 align:start position:0%
delighted that i can certainly i can
 
02:24:48.230 --> 02:24:48.240 align:start position:0%
certainly understand if you don't want
 
02:24:51.910 --> 02:24:51.920 align:start position:0%
to bother with this at all so um that's
 
02:24:52.950 --> 02:24:52.960 align:start position:0%
and um
 
02:24:55.510 --> 02:24:55.520 align:start position:0%
and as also as i said obviously i passed
 
02:24:57.590 --> 02:24:57.600 align:start position:0%
this long before the decision to meet at
 
02:25:01.110 --> 02:25:01.120 align:start position:0%
the doubletree was was was made
 
02:25:02.230 --> 02:25:02.240 align:start position:0%
so thank you thank you very much for
 
02:25:04.870 --> 02:25:04.880 align:start position:0%
your time thank you um would you be
 
02:25:07.270 --> 02:25:07.280 align:start position:0%
willing to take questions sure kevin
 
02:25:11.910 --> 02:25:11.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:14.950 --> 02:25:14.960 align:start position:0%
one oh i'm in trouble
 
02:25:16.870 --> 02:25:16.880 align:start position:0%
i guess it's my day today
 
02:25:16.880 --> 02:25:17.670 align:start position:0%
i guess it's my day today
um

02:25:17.670 --> 02:25:17.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:25:21.670 --> 02:25:21.680 align:start position:0%
i just had a question um on lines 15 and
 
02:25:21.680 --> 02:25:23.670 align:start position:0%
i just had a question um on lines 15 and
16

02:25:23.670 --> 02:25:23.680 align:start position:0%
16
 
02:25:26.150 --> 02:25:26.160 align:start position:0%
it appears as though a representative
 
02:25:27.510 --> 02:25:27.520 align:start position:0%
that is
 
02:25:30.150 --> 02:25:30.160 align:start position:0%
traveling for 45 miles gets a certain
 
02:25:31.750 --> 02:25:31.760 align:start position:0%
percentage per mile
 
02:25:34.309 --> 02:25:34.319 align:start position:0%
and for all miles in excess of that 45
 
02:25:36.950 --> 02:25:36.960 align:start position:0%
miles they get 19. i know that's current
 
02:25:39.590 --> 02:25:39.600 align:start position:0%
law but was that looked at when you were
 
02:25:40.870 --> 02:25:40.880 align:start position:0%
doing this
 
02:25:44.150 --> 02:25:44.160 align:start position:0%
well looked at a little bit that's a
 
02:25:46.950 --> 02:25:46.960 align:start position:0%
um the origins of
 
02:25:49.429 --> 02:25:49.439 align:start position:0%
the origin of that go way back about 60
 
02:25:50.870 --> 02:25:50.880 align:start position:0%
years when
 
02:25:52.550 --> 02:25:52.560 align:start position:0%
there was some couple of court cases
 
02:25:54.070 --> 02:25:54.080 align:start position:0%
about mileage before that i think we
 
02:25:55.270 --> 02:25:55.280 align:start position:0%
could just set our own mileage and
 
02:25:57.910 --> 02:25:57.920 align:start position:0%
anything we wanted and uh
 
02:25:59.590 --> 02:25:59.600 align:start position:0%
the payments i think were medications
 
02:26:02.469 --> 02:26:02.479 align:start position:0%
much higher than they are now but um
 
02:26:04.469 --> 02:26:04.479 align:start position:0%
this is something called the uh
 
02:26:05.670 --> 02:26:05.680 align:start position:0%
this is something called the federal
 
02:26:07.510 --> 02:26:07.520 align:start position:0%
plan which only a handful of members
 
02:26:10.870 --> 02:26:10.880 align:start position:0%
still sign up for because um
 
02:26:12.550 --> 02:26:12.560 align:start position:0%
it's less attractive in most cases
 
02:26:14.630 --> 02:26:14.640 align:start position:0%
because it's taxable income but some do
 
02:26:17.510 --> 02:26:17.520 align:start position:0%
choose to sign up for it for uh
 
02:26:19.510 --> 02:26:19.520 align:start position:0%
reasons of their own like for example i
 
02:26:21.190 --> 02:26:21.200 align:start position:0%
think some signed up for it in order to
 
02:26:23.429 --> 02:26:23.439 align:start position:0%
get credit towards social security so
 
02:26:25.190 --> 02:26:25.200 align:start position:0%
that's i mean that's something maybe
 
02:26:26.469 --> 02:26:26.479 align:start position:0%
should be looked at at some point but
 
02:26:28.790 --> 02:26:28.800 align:start position:0%
that's kind of a relic
 
02:26:31.670 --> 02:26:31.680 align:start position:0%
from several decades ago and has stayed
 
02:26:35.110 --> 02:26:35.120 align:start position:0%
in the law and um maybe some merit to
 
02:26:37.349 --> 02:26:37.359 align:start position:0%
eliminating that or changing changing
 
02:26:38.710 --> 02:26:38.720 align:start position:0%
the rate to the current rate but i was
 
02:26:39.670 --> 02:26:39.680 align:start position:0%
just taking something that's been
 
02:26:41.110 --> 02:26:41.120 align:start position:0%
sitting in the law books for really for
 
02:26:41.120 --> 02:26:44.389 align:start position:0%
sitting in the law books for really for
decades

02:26:44.389 --> 02:26:44.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:45.910 --> 02:26:45.920 align:start position:0%
one last follow-up and the reason i
 
02:26:49.110 --> 02:26:49.120 align:start position:0%
asked that is on line 19 it talks about
 
02:26:50.469 --> 02:26:50.479 align:start position:0%
if we paid at the maximum rate
 
02:26:52.070 --> 02:26:52.080 align:start position:0%
established by the internal revenue code
 
02:26:53.190 --> 02:26:53.200 align:start position:0%
so i just wondered if there was a
 
02:26:55.990 --> 02:26:56.000 align:start position:0%
conflict there and whether or not lines
 
02:26:57.830 --> 02:26:57.840 align:start position:0%
15 and 16 should have been removed from
 
02:26:59.270 --> 02:26:59.280 align:start position:0%
the statute
 
02:26:59.280 --> 02:27:00.830 align:start position:0%
the statute
uh

02:27:00.830 --> 02:27:00.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:27:03.670 --> 02:27:03.680 align:start position:0%
i i don't know you're you're very good
 
02:27:05.190 --> 02:27:05.200 align:start position:0%
i'm not a lawyer you're a very you're a
 
02:27:06.710 --> 02:27:06.720 align:start position:0%
lawyer and a very good one from what i
 
02:27:09.910 --> 02:27:09.920 align:start position:0%
stand and um i don't don't really don't
 
02:27:11.510 --> 02:27:11.520 align:start position:0%
really have a uh don't really have an
 
02:27:13.190 --> 02:27:13.200 align:start position:0%
answer off the top of my head head for
 
02:27:14.790 --> 02:27:14.800 align:start position:0%
that um that's all this is also a
 
02:27:16.630 --> 02:27:16.640 align:start position:0%
language that's been in there for a long
 
02:27:18.070 --> 02:27:18.080 align:start position:0%
time we're just
 
02:27:20.309 --> 02:27:20.319 align:start position:0%
both cases the aim of both this bill and
 
02:27:22.950 --> 02:27:22.960 align:start position:0%
the other one was just to add this uh
 
02:27:24.630 --> 02:27:24.640 align:start position:0%
it's just authorized ourselves to pay us
 
02:27:27.429 --> 02:27:27.439 align:start position:0%
for off-site uh sessions all right thank
 
02:27:28.830 --> 02:27:28.840 align:start position:0%
you very
 
02:27:31.670 --> 02:27:31.680 align:start position:0%
much further questions
 
02:27:31.680 --> 02:27:33.030 align:start position:0%
much further questions
um

02:27:33.030 --> 02:27:33.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:27:34.309 --> 02:27:34.319 align:start position:0%
i have one
 
02:27:37.270 --> 02:27:37.280 align:start position:0%
if you don't mind um so my my question
 
02:27:37.280 --> 02:27:38.389 align:start position:0%
if you don't mind um so my my question
is

02:27:38.389 --> 02:27:38.399 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:27:42.309 --> 02:27:42.319 align:start position:0%
everything that this bill of yours does
 
02:27:45.510 --> 02:27:45.520 align:start position:0%
is currently being done by um a simple
 
02:27:45.520 --> 02:27:46.790 align:start position:0%
is currently being done by um a simple
vote

02:27:46.790 --> 02:27:46.800 align:start position:0%
vote
 
02:27:49.110 --> 02:27:49.120 align:start position:0%
taken at the beginning of session
 
02:27:52.550 --> 02:27:52.560 align:start position:0%
um when we were not in the emergency but
 
02:27:54.389 --> 02:27:54.399 align:start position:0%
everyone um
 
02:27:56.469 --> 02:27:56.479 align:start position:0%
suspended the rules in order to make
 
02:27:58.950 --> 02:27:58.960 align:start position:0%
sure that we were all paid is that is
 
02:28:00.710 --> 02:28:00.720 align:start position:0%
that essentially correct that we are
 
02:28:00.720 --> 02:28:01.750 align:start position:0%
that essentially correct that we are
just

02:28:01.750 --> 02:28:01.760 align:start position:0%
just
 
02:28:04.550 --> 02:28:04.560 align:start position:0%
um this this bypasses the suspension of
 
02:28:07.750 --> 02:28:07.760 align:start position:0%
the rules um necessitated
 
02:28:10.309 --> 02:28:10.319 align:start position:0%
to pay from a separate location
 
02:28:12.550 --> 02:28:12.560 align:start position:0%
all right kind of as i understood the
 
02:28:14.550 --> 02:28:14.560 align:start position:0%
separate the suspension rule this is
 
02:28:17.429 --> 02:28:17.439 align:start position:0%
actually bill so it's been permanently
 
02:28:21.270 --> 02:28:21.280 align:start position:0%
on those uh rsa 1415a and
 
02:28:22.950 --> 02:28:22.960 align:start position:0%
one two they've been permanently changed
 
02:28:24.630 --> 02:28:24.640 align:start position:0%
by the bill so it wasn't just a one-time
 
02:28:26.950 --> 02:28:26.960 align:start position:0%
resolution to for that one week but that
 
02:28:26.960 --> 02:28:27.670 align:start position:0%
resolution to for that one week but that
was

02:28:27.670 --> 02:28:27.680 align:start position:0%
was
 
02:28:29.750 --> 02:28:29.760 align:start position:0%
a bill which
 
02:28:31.270 --> 02:28:31.280 align:start position:0%
was introduced in the rules committee
 
02:28:33.190 --> 02:28:33.200 align:start position:0%
and they gave themselves permission to
 
02:28:35.750 --> 02:28:35.760 align:start position:0%
uh you know drafted suspend the
 
02:28:37.910 --> 02:28:37.920 align:start position:0%
deadlines and then the full house gave
 
02:28:40.070 --> 02:28:40.080 align:start position:0%
them permission to draft the deadlines
 
02:28:41.429 --> 02:28:41.439 align:start position:0%
and we sent it to the senate and they
 
02:28:43.990 --> 02:28:44.000 align:start position:0%
passed it so that's uh yep thank you
 
02:28:45.510 --> 02:28:45.520 align:start position:0%
very much it's been permanently changed
 
02:28:48.870 --> 02:28:48.880 align:start position:0%
so yes thanks appreciate it
 
02:28:48.880 --> 02:28:50.710 align:start position:0%
so yes thanks appreciate it
um

02:28:50.710 --> 02:28:50.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:28:52.950 --> 02:28:52.960 align:start position:0%
we were getting a
 
02:28:55.190 --> 02:28:55.200 align:start position:0%
nod that the uh honorable house clerk
 
02:28:56.389 --> 02:28:56.399 align:start position:0%
would like to
 
02:28:58.710 --> 02:28:58.720 align:start position:0%
comment briefly on this
 
02:29:00.950 --> 02:29:00.960 align:start position:0%
and help us with very briefly mr
 
02:29:03.030 --> 02:29:03.040 align:start position:0%

02:29:04.550 --> 02:29:04.560 align:start position:0%
house uh thank you for
 
02:29:06.389 --> 02:29:06.399 align:start position:0%
recognizing me um
 
02:29:08.790 --> 02:29:08.800 align:start position:0%
so just just a quick clarification
 
02:29:12.389 --> 02:29:12.399 align:start position:0%
uh there's nothing and again i testify
 
02:29:14.230 --> 02:29:14.240 align:start position:0%
neither in support of nor in opposition
 
02:29:17.429 --> 02:29:17.439 align:start position:0%
to legislation um the situation
 
02:29:19.910 --> 02:29:19.920 align:start position:0%
regarding representative horgan's bill
 
02:29:22.710 --> 02:29:22.720 align:start position:0%
and the reason why new legislation was
 
02:29:22.720 --> 02:29:23.910 align:start position:0%
and the reason why new legislation was
filed

02:29:23.910 --> 02:29:23.920 align:start position:0%
filed
 
02:29:26.150 --> 02:29:26.160 align:start position:0%
for the emergency purposes we have to go
 
02:29:27.750 --> 02:29:27.760 align:start position:0%
back to the pandemic
 
02:29:29.590 --> 02:29:29.600 align:start position:0%
during the pandemic when we were meeting
 
02:29:31.750 --> 02:29:31.760 align:start position:0%
off-site and we were under the state of
 
02:29:33.750 --> 02:29:33.760 align:start position:0%
emergency the governor issued an
 
02:29:36.070 --> 02:29:36.080 align:start position:0%
executive order which allowed for the
 
02:29:38.150 --> 02:29:38.160 align:start position:0%
legislature to be paid in an off-site
 
02:29:38.160 --> 02:29:39.190 align:start position:0%
legislature to be paid in an off-site
manner

02:29:39.190 --> 02:29:39.200 align:start position:0%
manner
 
02:29:41.030 --> 02:29:41.040 align:start position:0%
that was part of one of the executive
 
02:29:42.550 --> 02:29:42.560 align:start position:0%
orders that was
 
02:29:44.790 --> 02:29:44.800 align:start position:0%
issued and that's how we were able to
 
02:29:46.389 --> 02:29:46.399 align:start position:0%
pay you while we were meeting at the
 
02:29:48.790 --> 02:29:48.800 align:start position:0%
whitmore center at
 
02:29:50.230 --> 02:29:50.240 align:start position:0%
the field hockey pitch outside the
 
02:29:51.910 --> 02:29:51.920 align:start position:0%
woodwork center at the parking lot and
 
02:29:54.870 --> 02:29:54.880 align:start position:0%
then at the sports plex
 
02:29:57.349 --> 02:29:57.359 align:start position:0%
the situation is that
 
02:30:00.389 --> 02:30:00.399 align:start position:0%
we had to fix something
 
02:30:01.830 --> 02:30:01.840 align:start position:0%
on the fly
 
02:30:03.349 --> 02:30:03.359 align:start position:0%
in order to make
 
02:30:05.510 --> 02:30:05.520 align:start position:0%
the doubletree work
 
02:30:07.910 --> 02:30:07.920 align:start position:0%
and we had to do it in a manner that was
 
02:30:10.790 --> 02:30:10.800 align:start position:0%
specific to that and that was why
 
02:30:13.510 --> 02:30:13.520 align:start position:0%
legislation was filed that wasn't there
 
02:30:15.190 --> 02:30:15.200 align:start position:0%
was there was nothing against
 
02:30:17.030 --> 02:30:17.040 align:start position:0%
representative horrigan's bill nobody
 
02:30:20.230 --> 02:30:20.240 align:start position:0%
was against the concept it was specific
 
02:30:20.240 --> 02:30:20.950 align:start position:0%
was against the concept it was specific
to

02:30:20.950 --> 02:30:20.960 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:30:23.429 --> 02:30:23.439 align:start position:0%
needing to carve out that exemption for
 
02:30:26.150 --> 02:30:26.160 align:start position:0%
the doubletree for those first convening
 
02:30:30.070 --> 02:30:30.080 align:start position:0%
days of 2022 sessions so that was the
 
02:30:31.270 --> 02:30:31.280 align:start position:0%
whole purpose
 
02:30:32.790 --> 02:30:32.800 align:start position:0%
in that emergency
 
02:30:34.950 --> 02:30:34.960 align:start position:0%
you know suspension of the rules and
 
02:30:37.429 --> 02:30:37.439 align:start position:0%
getting things done but it was but uh
 
02:30:39.349 --> 02:30:39.359 align:start position:0%
the doubletree was not
 
02:30:41.590 --> 02:30:41.600 align:start position:0%
we were out of the the emergency period
 
02:30:42.550 --> 02:30:42.560 align:start position:0%
that's correct
 
02:30:44.469 --> 02:30:44.479 align:start position:0%
that's correct and that is why we needed
 
02:30:46.950 --> 02:30:46.960 align:start position:0%
legislation because uh without that
 
02:30:48.550 --> 02:30:48.560 align:start position:0%
legislation and
 
02:30:50.070 --> 02:30:50.080 align:start position:0%
and and unfortunately representative
 
02:30:51.910 --> 02:30:51.920 align:start position:0%
horgan's bill didn't address
 
02:30:54.469 --> 02:30:54.479 align:start position:0%
that meeting off site at that point what
 
02:30:56.870 --> 02:30:56.880 align:start position:0%
it didn't have that immediate effect um
 
02:30:59.670 --> 02:30:59.680 align:start position:0%
and so that was why uh it was
 
02:31:02.550 --> 02:31:02.560 align:start position:0%
literally rushed through and we it was
 
02:31:04.150 --> 02:31:04.160 align:start position:0%
signed into law the very day that we
 
02:31:05.750 --> 02:31:05.760 align:start position:0%
passed it which is
 
02:31:08.469 --> 02:31:08.479 align:start position:0%
extremely unusual as as most of you know
 
02:31:08.479 --> 02:31:09.270 align:start position:0%
extremely unusual as as most of you know
um

02:31:09.270 --> 02:31:09.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:31:11.670 --> 02:31:11.680 align:start position:0%
that being said uh representative yard
 
02:31:13.190 --> 02:31:13.200 align:start position:0%
asked questions about the mileage i
 
02:31:15.349 --> 02:31:15.359 align:start position:0%
would just note that we have two mileage
 
02:31:17.030 --> 02:31:17.040 align:start position:0%
rates we have a federal rate and a state
 
02:31:19.190 --> 02:31:19.200 align:start position:0%
rate the federal rate is
 
02:31:22.070 --> 02:31:22.080 align:start position:0%
what the irs computes the state rate is
 
02:31:23.110 --> 02:31:23.120 align:start position:0%
a different
 
02:31:25.270 --> 02:31:25.280 align:start position:0%
effect and that's why you see different
 
02:31:27.349 --> 02:31:27.359 align:start position:0%
references within the statute
 
02:31:28.550 --> 02:31:28.560 align:start position:0%
so i would just
 
02:31:30.309 --> 02:31:30.319 align:start position:0%
that that's sort of the the background
 
02:31:31.429 --> 02:31:31.439 align:start position:0%
on that
 
02:31:33.910 --> 02:31:33.920 align:start position:0%
great um further questions
 
02:31:33.920 --> 02:31:34.790 align:start position:0%
great um further questions
yes

02:31:34.790 --> 02:31:34.800 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:31:38.230 --> 02:31:38.240 align:start position:0%
i knew there would be one yes he knew it
 
02:31:40.469 --> 02:31:40.479 align:start position:0%
the question wasn't quite so much that
 
02:31:42.790 --> 02:31:42.800 align:start position:0%
the state versus the federal rate it's
 
02:31:45.030 --> 02:31:45.040 align:start position:0%
for the first 45 miles you get a certain
 
02:31:47.190 --> 02:31:47.200 align:start position:0%
amount and for all miles after that you
 
02:31:49.830 --> 02:31:49.840 align:start position:0%
get another
 
02:31:51.910 --> 02:31:51.920 align:start position:0%
i i think if representative i think if
 
02:31:53.349 --> 02:31:53.359 align:start position:0%
you want to study that issue that would
 
02:31:55.270 --> 02:31:55.280 align:start position:0%
be a perfect example of
 
02:31:56.870 --> 02:31:56.880 align:start position:0%
of utilizing the ad hoc committee
 
02:31:58.309 --> 02:31:58.319 align:start position:0%
process for
 
02:32:00.630 --> 02:32:00.640 align:start position:0%
for an in-depth study
 
02:32:02.870 --> 02:32:02.880 align:start position:0%
on why it is we do the things we do was
 
02:32:04.469 --> 02:32:04.479 align:start position:0%
that a volunteer
 
02:32:06.550 --> 02:32:06.560 align:start position:0%
so follow up on this question
 
02:32:09.510 --> 02:32:09.520 align:start position:0%
the question is then a statement perhaps
 
02:32:13.670 --> 02:32:13.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:16.469 --> 02:32:16.479 align:start position:0%
it's not good for them i i would i would
 
02:32:18.870 --> 02:32:18.880 align:start position:0%
note that it depends on the mileage rate
 
02:32:20.150 --> 02:32:20.160 align:start position:0%
that you're taking
 
02:32:21.910 --> 02:32:21.920 align:start position:0%
because if you're taking one mileage
 
02:32:23.990 --> 02:32:24.000 align:start position:0%
versus a different one you are you are
 
02:32:25.750 --> 02:32:25.760 align:start position:0%
going to be compensated differently but
 
02:32:27.270 --> 02:32:27.280 align:start position:0%
you also have to remember too that
 
02:32:29.349 --> 02:32:29.359 align:start position:0%
somebody potentially driving from
 
02:32:32.230 --> 02:32:32.240 align:start position:0%
pittsburgh uh may likely be staying over
 
02:32:33.590 --> 02:32:33.600 align:start position:0%
and isn't entitled to the federal
 
02:32:33.600 --> 02:32:34.870 align:start position:0%
and isn't entitled to the federal
mileagery

02:32:34.870 --> 02:32:34.880 align:start position:0%
mileagery
 
02:32:36.870 --> 02:32:36.880 align:start position:0%
because they stay over
 
02:32:38.630 --> 02:32:38.640 align:start position:0%
and and you have to take you have to
 
02:32:40.389 --> 02:32:40.399 align:start position:0%
swear an affidavit every time you come
 
02:32:42.469 --> 02:32:42.479 align:start position:0%
down that you've traveled that full
 
02:32:44.630 --> 02:32:44.640 align:start position:0%
mileage so correct
 
02:32:47.590 --> 02:32:47.600 align:start position:0%
thank you of course anytime
 
02:32:49.349 --> 02:32:49.359 align:start position:0%
i think we're set
 
02:32:50.950 --> 02:32:50.960 align:start position:0%
great thank you
 
02:32:54.550 --> 02:32:54.560 align:start position:0%

02:34:48.870 --> 02:34:48.880 align:start position:0%
committee of the general court so this
 
02:34:50.950 --> 02:34:50.960 align:start position:0%
bill was filed by representative cushing
 
02:34:53.270 --> 02:34:53.280 align:start position:0%
to ensure proportional partisan
 
02:34:54.950 --> 02:34:54.960 align:start position:0%
representation on the joint fiscal
 
02:34:54.960 --> 02:34:55.910 align:start position:0%
representation on the joint fiscal
committee

02:34:55.910 --> 02:34:55.920 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:34:57.670 --> 02:34:57.680 align:start position:0%
the fiscal committee is one of the many
 
02:34:59.349 --> 02:34:59.359 align:start position:0%
statutory committees established in
 
02:35:02.150 --> 02:35:02.160 align:start position:0%
title one of new hampshire's rsas most
 
02:35:03.750 --> 02:35:03.760 align:start position:0%
statutory committees contain
 
02:35:05.830 --> 02:35:05.840 align:start position:0%
requirements in the law for minority
 
02:35:08.389 --> 02:35:08.399 align:start position:0%
party participation or representation
 
02:35:10.790 --> 02:35:10.800 align:start position:0%
sorry so for instance
 
02:35:12.790 --> 02:35:12.800 align:start position:0%
joint facilities committee
 
02:35:14.550 --> 02:35:14.560 align:start position:0%
requires a minority leader or doesn't
 
02:35:15.990 --> 02:35:16.000 align:start position:0%
need to be appointed the joint
 
02:35:17.750 --> 02:35:17.760 align:start position:0%
legislative historical committee
 
02:35:20.550 --> 02:35:20.560 align:start position:0%

and the long-range planning commission
 
02:35:25.670 --> 02:35:25.680 align:start position:0%
appoints four house members no more than
 
02:35:27.990 --> 02:35:28.000 align:start position:0%
three from any political party
 
02:35:29.910 --> 02:35:29.920 align:start position:0%
the fiscal committee differs
 
02:35:31.510 --> 02:35:31.520 align:start position:0%
from these in that it contains no
 
02:35:34.230 --> 02:35:34.240 align:start position:0%
requirement for minority party
 
02:35:34.240 --> 02:35:35.349 align:start position:0%
requirement for minority party
appointment

02:35:35.349 --> 02:35:35.359 align:start position:0%
appointment
 
02:35:37.270 --> 02:35:37.280 align:start position:0%
under the current statutory construction
 
02:35:38.710 --> 02:35:38.720 align:start position:0%
the fiscal committee consists of the
 
02:35:40.550 --> 02:35:40.560 align:start position:0%
finance chair two members appointed by
 
02:35:42.070 --> 02:35:42.080 align:start position:0%
the finance chair and two members
 
02:35:43.590 --> 02:35:43.600 align:start position:0%
appointed by the speaker
 
02:35:45.429 --> 02:35:45.439 align:start position:0%
this means that under current law there
 
02:35:47.830 --> 02:35:47.840 align:start position:0%
is no guarantee of minority party
 
02:35:50.150 --> 02:35:50.160 align:start position:0%
representation on the fiscal committee
 
02:35:51.590 --> 02:35:51.600 align:start position:0%
the speaker and finance chair are
 
02:35:54.070 --> 02:35:54.080 align:start position:0%
allowed to appoint an unproportional
 
02:35:55.990 --> 02:35:56.000 align:start position:0%
membership even zero members of the
 
02:35:57.990 --> 02:35:58.000 align:start position:0%
minority party to the fiscal committee
 
02:35:59.590 --> 02:35:59.600 align:start position:0%
if they desire
 
02:36:01.030 --> 02:36:01.040 align:start position:0%
this term even though the house
 
02:36:02.870 --> 02:36:02.880 align:start position:0%
membership between two parties is even
 
02:36:02.880 --> 02:36:03.990 align:start position:0%
membership between two parties is even
more

02:36:03.990 --> 02:36:04.000 align:start position:0%
more
 
02:36:05.750 --> 02:36:05.760 align:start position:0%
than ever before
 
02:36:07.429 --> 02:36:07.439 align:start position:0%
the speaker chose to appoint four
 
02:36:09.510 --> 02:36:09.520 align:start position:0%
members of the majority party and only
 
02:36:11.190 --> 02:36:11.200 align:start position:0%
one member of the minority party to
 
02:36:11.200 --> 02:36:12.309 align:start position:0%
one member of the minority party to
fiscal

02:36:12.309 --> 02:36:12.319 align:start position:0%
fiscal
 
02:36:14.230 --> 02:36:14.240 align:start position:0%
this bill will align
 
02:36:16.309 --> 02:36:16.319 align:start position:0%
the fiscal committee statute with other
 
02:36:18.230 --> 02:36:18.240 align:start position:0%
statutes establishing statutory
 
02:36:20.870 --> 02:36:20.880 align:start position:0%
committees which require minority party
 
02:36:20.880 --> 02:36:22.950 align:start position:0%
committees which require minority party
representation

02:36:22.950 --> 02:36:22.960 align:start position:0%
representation
 
02:36:24.630 --> 02:36:24.640 align:start position:0%
though the method outlined in the bill
 
02:36:26.230 --> 02:36:26.240 align:start position:0%
the fiscal committee will be three
 
02:36:28.790 --> 02:36:28.800 align:start position:0%
members for the majority party at 60
 
02:36:31.110 --> 02:36:31.120 align:start position:0%
percent and two members 40 for the
 
02:36:33.670 --> 02:36:33.680 align:start position:0%
minority party and this aligns with the
 
02:36:35.349 --> 02:36:35.359 align:start position:0%
common common practice that most
 
02:36:37.110 --> 02:36:37.120 align:start position:0%
speakers appoint three majority members
 
02:36:39.270 --> 02:36:39.280 align:start position:0%
and two minority members and with voter
 
02:36:39.280 --> 02:36:40.630 align:start position:0%
and two minority members and with voter
sentiment

02:36:40.630 --> 02:36:40.640 align:start position:0%
sentiment
 
02:36:42.150 --> 02:36:42.160 align:start position:0%
and um
 
02:36:44.469 --> 02:36:44.479 align:start position:0%
i would also make it so that the
 
02:36:46.070 --> 02:36:46.080 align:start position:0%
the person chosen would be done by the
 
02:36:48.550 --> 02:36:48.560 align:start position:0%
minority leader rather than uh the
 
02:36:52.070 --> 02:36:52.080 align:start position:0%
speaker um so you know just some other
 
02:36:55.030 --> 02:36:55.040 align:start position:0%
ideas to consider it i mean the prime
 
02:36:56.870 --> 02:36:56.880 align:start position:0%
sponsor is open to any amendments on it
 
02:36:56.880 --> 02:36:57.590 align:start position:0%
sponsor is open to any amendments on it
but

02:36:57.590 --> 02:36:57.600 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:36:59.750 --> 02:36:59.760 align:start position:0%
um was open to the idea of amendments
 
02:37:01.750 --> 02:37:01.760 align:start position:0%
but you know you can change the language
 
02:37:03.349 --> 02:37:03.359 align:start position:0%
in-house rules on standing committee
 
02:37:05.190 --> 02:37:05.200 align:start position:0%
representation requiring that fiscal
 
02:37:06.550 --> 02:37:06.560 align:start position:0%
committee membership
 
02:37:09.030 --> 02:37:09.040 align:start position:0%
uh be divided into two major political
 
02:37:10.950 --> 02:37:10.960 align:start position:0%
parties in the same proportion
 
02:37:13.349 --> 02:37:13.359 align:start position:0%
uh as the house membership of the
 
02:37:15.270 --> 02:37:15.280 align:start position:0%
majority party and
 
02:37:16.469 --> 02:37:16.479 align:start position:0%
the house membership of the minority
 
02:37:19.429 --> 02:37:19.439 align:start position:0%
party um or you can change it to like i
 
02:37:21.270 --> 02:37:21.280 align:start position:0%
said the commission the long range
 
02:37:22.870 --> 02:37:22.880 align:start position:0%
planning commission of no more than
 
02:37:25.429 --> 02:37:25.439 align:start position:0%
three members of the same party of the
 
02:37:28.070 --> 02:37:28.080 align:start position:0%
four members that it requires so
 
02:37:30.710 --> 02:37:30.720 align:start position:0%
with that um you know i'm open to taking
 
02:37:32.870 --> 02:37:32.880 align:start position:0%
any questions and uh conclude my
 
02:37:32.880 --> 02:37:34.790 align:start position:0%
any questions and uh conclude my
testimony

02:37:34.790 --> 02:37:34.800 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
02:37:37.110 --> 02:37:37.120 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony um i do
 
02:37:39.110 --> 02:37:39.120 align:start position:0%
have a question understand that this is
 
02:37:39.120 --> 02:37:40.150 align:start position:0%
have a question understand that this is
not

02:37:40.150 --> 02:37:40.160 align:start position:0%
not
 
02:37:41.990 --> 02:37:42.000 align:start position:0%
the representative's
 
02:37:44.309 --> 02:37:44.319 align:start position:0%
bill you understand that so
 
02:37:46.710 --> 02:37:46.720 align:start position:0%
okay fine pretty cool respond i didn't
 
02:37:49.670 --> 02:37:49.680 align:start position:0%
want you to be um saddled with technical
 
02:37:50.950 --> 02:37:50.960 align:start position:0%
questions when
 
02:37:52.950 --> 02:37:52.960 align:start position:0%
you didn't put it together well it might
 
02:37:54.230 --> 02:37:54.240 align:start position:0%
actually be a question that the clerk
 
02:37:56.309 --> 02:37:56.319 align:start position:0%
can answer better to be honest but uh
 
02:37:58.309 --> 02:37:58.319 align:start position:0%
this bill pertains to
 
02:38:01.750 --> 02:38:01.760 align:start position:0%
uh what the senate can do and cannot do
 
02:38:04.469 --> 02:38:04.479 align:start position:0%
are we authorized to
 
02:38:08.309 --> 02:38:08.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:10.550 --> 02:38:10.560 align:start position:0%
ask away
 
02:38:11.830 --> 02:38:11.840 align:start position:0%
i mean this bill is also going before
 
02:38:13.670 --> 02:38:13.680 align:start position:0%
the senate so they they'll have a chance
 
02:38:16.309 --> 02:38:16.319 align:start position:0%
to to also make any changes if they
 
02:38:17.750 --> 02:38:17.760 align:start position:0%
believe that they want to make any
 
02:38:19.750 --> 02:38:19.760 align:start position:0%
changes to their their side of it so it
 
02:38:21.830 --> 02:38:21.840 align:start position:0%
will go to both committees yeah both
 
02:38:24.150 --> 02:38:24.160 align:start position:0%
sides okay yeah i was just curious
 
02:38:25.750 --> 02:38:25.760 align:start position:0%
because where we would actually be
 
02:38:28.150 --> 02:38:28.160 align:start position:0%
voting on what they are can and cannot
 
02:38:29.510 --> 02:38:29.520 align:start position:0%
do so i just wasn't sure if that was
 
02:38:31.110 --> 02:38:31.120 align:start position:0%
appropriate or not that was all right
 
02:38:33.110 --> 02:38:33.120 align:start position:0%
and they would vote on what we
 
02:38:35.030 --> 02:38:35.040 align:start position:0%
what we could do and what we can't do as
 
02:38:37.750 --> 02:38:37.760 align:start position:0%
well as if it went over to their side
 
02:38:39.510 --> 02:38:39.520 align:start position:0%
if it did pass the house once again
 
02:38:41.270 --> 02:38:41.280 align:start position:0%
first year i'm just
 
02:38:42.550 --> 02:38:42.560 align:start position:0%
asking questions that i don't know
 
02:38:44.870 --> 02:38:44.880 align:start position:0%
answers to it helps me too so don't
 
02:38:44.880 --> 02:38:47.670 align:start position:0%
answers to it helps me too so don't
worry

02:38:47.670 --> 02:38:47.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:50.230 --> 02:38:50.240 align:start position:0%
okay thanks think we're all set no
 
02:38:52.230 --> 02:38:52.240 align:start position:0%
further questions thank you
 
02:38:54.150 --> 02:38:54.160 align:start position:0%

02:38:54.160 --> 02:38:55.030 align:start position:0%
i do have another pink card however from
a

02:38:55.030 --> 02:38:55.040 align:start position:0%

long time
 
02:38:58.950 --> 02:38:58.960 align:start position:0%

as you say i've been on
 
02:39:15.990 --> 02:39:16.000 align:start position:0%
i think i've been on fiscal committee
 
02:39:18.950 --> 02:39:18.960 align:start position:0%
longer than anyone else at this point
 
02:39:18.960 --> 02:39:20.790 align:start position:0%

um
 
02:39:22.550 --> 02:39:22.560 align:start position:0%
when i was
 
02:39:24.710 --> 02:39:24.720 align:start position:0%
first on it and
 
02:39:28.230 --> 02:39:28.240 align:start position:0%
first cheering it in i think 2012
 
02:39:28.240 --> 02:39:29.349 align:start position:0%
first cheering it in i think 2012
and

02:39:29.349 --> 02:39:29.359 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:39:31.429 --> 02:39:31.439 align:start position:0%
and i went and saw the speaker and said
 
02:39:33.190 --> 02:39:33.200 align:start position:0%
okay i get two appointments and you get
 
02:39:34.550 --> 02:39:34.560 align:start position:0%
two appointments
 
02:39:36.550 --> 02:39:36.560 align:start position:0%
traditionally we've had
 
02:39:38.630 --> 02:39:38.640 align:start position:0%
uh three members of the majority party
 
02:39:41.190 --> 02:39:41.200 align:start position:0%
and two members of the minority party
 
02:39:43.110 --> 02:39:43.120 align:start position:0%
and he says well i'm appointing this
 
02:39:44.630 --> 02:39:44.640 align:start position:0%
person and this person i said you're not
 
02:39:46.389 --> 02:39:46.399 align:start position:0%
appointing a democrat
 
02:39:48.710 --> 02:39:48.720 align:start position:0%
he said no you want any democrats on it
 
02:39:49.990 --> 02:39:50.000 align:start position:0%
you've got to appoint them so i
 
02:39:52.950 --> 02:39:52.960 align:start position:0%
appointed to democrats but we
 
02:39:55.510 --> 02:39:55.520 align:start position:0%
traditionally stuck with that
 
02:39:57.190 --> 02:39:57.200 align:start position:0%
most of the time before i was on the
 
02:39:59.270 --> 02:39:59.280 align:start position:0%
fiscal committee when rep
 
02:40:02.070 --> 02:40:02.080 align:start position:0%
representative scitec was the speaker
 
02:40:04.550 --> 02:40:04.560 align:start position:0%
i remember at one point she decided that
 
02:40:06.790 --> 02:40:06.800 align:start position:0%
she needed more control on this on the
 
02:40:08.309 --> 02:40:08.319 align:start position:0%
fiscal committee
 
02:40:09.910 --> 02:40:09.920 align:start position:0%
and so she put on
 
02:40:11.910 --> 02:40:11.920 align:start position:0%
her two appointments one of them was i
 
02:40:13.990 --> 02:40:14.000 align:start position:0%
think the majority leader and the other
 
02:40:15.030 --> 02:40:15.040 align:start position:0%
one was
 
02:40:17.670 --> 02:40:17.680 align:start position:0%
the chairman of ways and means
 
02:40:17.680 --> 02:40:19.030 align:start position:0%
the chairman of ways and means
and

02:40:19.030 --> 02:40:19.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:40:20.790 --> 02:40:20.800 align:start position:0%
speaking with those people i was on the
 
02:40:22.630 --> 02:40:22.640 align:start position:0%
finance committee at the time but not on
 
02:40:24.630 --> 02:40:24.640 align:start position:0%
the fiscal committee speaking with those
 
02:40:27.110 --> 02:40:27.120 align:start position:0%
people later they said
 
02:40:29.510 --> 02:40:29.520 align:start position:0%
i don't know what i'm doing here
 
02:40:31.349 --> 02:40:31.359 align:start position:0%
basically all the issues that come
 
02:40:34.309 --> 02:40:34.319 align:start position:0%
before fiscal committee are budgetary
 
02:40:35.830 --> 02:40:35.840 align:start position:0%
also those
 
02:40:37.670 --> 02:40:37.680 align:start position:0%
things i just pointed out with all of
 
02:40:39.990 --> 02:40:40.000 align:start position:0%
the reports that we get from
 
02:40:42.070 --> 02:40:42.080 align:start position:0%
the lba
 
02:40:43.590 --> 02:40:43.600 align:start position:0%
audit division
 
02:40:46.389 --> 02:40:46.399 align:start position:0%
we read audits we accept grants we
 
02:40:48.389 --> 02:40:48.399 align:start position:0%
approve transfers from this
 
02:40:50.550 --> 02:40:50.560 align:start position:0%
line to that line very much budget
 
02:40:50.560 --> 02:40:51.670 align:start position:0%
line to that line very much budget
related

02:40:51.670 --> 02:40:51.680 align:start position:0%
related
 
02:40:53.269 --> 02:40:53.279 align:start position:0%
so what's happening to this budget that
 
02:40:54.309 --> 02:40:54.319 align:start position:0%
we're putting the money from here to
 
02:40:56.469 --> 02:40:56.479 align:start position:0%
there and also keeps it in mind for the
 
02:40:58.070 --> 02:40:58.080 align:start position:0%
next time we do the budget why did you
 
02:40:59.670 --> 02:40:59.680 align:start position:0%
have to move so much money from here to
 
02:41:02.389 --> 02:41:02.399 align:start position:0%
there tell me what happened
 
02:41:04.950 --> 02:41:04.960 align:start position:0%
whatever it's a it's an insight into
 
02:41:06.710 --> 02:41:06.720 align:start position:0%
what's happening in the next budget or
 
02:41:08.389 --> 02:41:08.399 align:start position:0%
in the present budget
 
02:41:08.399 --> 02:41:09.349 align:start position:0%
in the present budget
so

02:41:09.349 --> 02:41:09.359 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:41:12.070 --> 02:41:12.080 align:start position:0%
all the stuff is budgetary
 
02:41:13.990 --> 02:41:14.000 align:start position:0%
so at one point
 
02:41:14.000 --> 02:41:15.750 align:start position:0%
so at one point
uh

02:41:15.750 --> 02:41:15.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:41:15.760 --> 02:41:15.990 align:start position:0%
uh
the

02:41:15.990 --> 02:41:16.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:41:16.000 --> 02:41:17.190 align:start position:0%
the
[Music]

02:41:17.190 --> 02:41:17.200 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:41:17.200 --> 02:41:18.710 align:start position:0%
[Music]
house

02:41:18.710 --> 02:41:18.720 align:start position:0%
house
 
02:41:21.910 --> 02:41:21.920 align:start position:0%
had a majority democrats and the senate
 
02:41:25.030 --> 02:41:25.040 align:start position:0%
head majority republicans
 
02:41:26.870 --> 02:41:26.880 align:start position:0%
the senate appointed
 
02:41:28.469 --> 02:41:28.479 align:start position:0%
one democrat
 
02:41:31.110 --> 02:41:31.120 align:start position:0%
and four republicans
 
02:41:33.830 --> 02:41:33.840 align:start position:0%
so the house said oh
 
02:41:35.910 --> 02:41:35.920 align:start position:0%
you're not going to get away with that
 
02:41:38.389 --> 02:41:38.399 align:start position:0%
we'll appoint four democrats
 
02:41:41.190 --> 02:41:41.200 align:start position:0%
and one republican which was me
 
02:41:42.790 --> 02:41:42.800 align:start position:0%
because i was the only one willing to be
 
02:41:45.030 --> 02:41:45.040 align:start position:0%
the clerk
 
02:41:47.590 --> 02:41:47.600 align:start position:0%
nobody else wanted the job
 
02:41:49.670 --> 02:41:49.680 align:start position:0%
i think that had more to do with it
 
02:41:49.680 --> 02:41:50.550 align:start position:0%
i think that had more to do with it
than

02:41:50.550 --> 02:41:50.560 align:start position:0%
than
 
02:41:53.349 --> 02:41:53.359 align:start position:0%
than my actual party
 
02:41:55.429 --> 02:41:55.439 align:start position:0%
and i had been the clerk a few terms
 
02:41:57.110 --> 02:41:57.120 align:start position:0%
before that so
 
02:42:01.190 --> 02:42:01.200 align:start position:0%
um yes so it ended up with four and one
 
02:42:03.590 --> 02:42:03.600 align:start position:0%
and then uh
 
02:42:04.790 --> 02:42:04.800 align:start position:0%
after that
 
02:42:06.389 --> 02:42:06.399 align:start position:0%
the presence
 
02:42:06.399 --> 02:42:07.190 align:start position:0%
the presence
well

02:42:07.190 --> 02:42:07.200 align:start position:0%
well
 
02:42:08.870 --> 02:42:08.880 align:start position:0%
dick hinch said
 
02:42:10.710 --> 02:42:10.720 align:start position:0%
okay we only need one democrat on
 
02:42:12.150 --> 02:42:12.160 align:start position:0%
they've done that to us in the past
 
02:42:14.550 --> 02:42:14.560 align:start position:0%
where we only had one republican so we
 
02:42:16.469 --> 02:42:16.479 align:start position:0%
don't need more than one
 
02:42:19.349 --> 02:42:19.359 align:start position:0%
and okay that was his appointment so
 
02:42:19.359 --> 02:42:20.389 align:start position:0%
and okay that was his appointment so
that's

02:42:20.389 --> 02:42:20.399 align:start position:0%
that's
 
02:42:24.230 --> 02:42:24.240 align:start position:0%
that's the way it's been now for
 
02:42:25.590 --> 02:42:25.600 align:start position:0%
a year or more
 
02:42:25.600 --> 02:42:27.110 align:start position:0%
a year or more
so

02:42:27.110 --> 02:42:27.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:42:27.120 --> 02:42:28.230 align:start position:0%
so
but

02:42:28.230 --> 02:42:28.240 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:42:30.469 --> 02:42:30.479 align:start position:0%
when we take this thing and make the
 
02:42:33.590 --> 02:42:33.600 align:start position:0%
minority leader be the appointee i'm
 
02:42:35.110 --> 02:42:35.120 align:start position:0%
fearful that it's going to be the
 
02:42:37.750 --> 02:42:37.760 align:start position:0%
minority leader and and maybe somebody
 
02:42:39.190 --> 02:42:39.200 align:start position:0%
else that
 
02:42:40.630 --> 02:42:40.640 align:start position:0%
as i
 
02:42:42.950 --> 02:42:42.960 align:start position:0%
experienced in the past when
 
02:42:45.269 --> 02:42:45.279 align:start position:0%
speaker scitec did this these people say
 
02:42:47.269 --> 02:42:47.279 align:start position:0%
i don't know what i'm doing here
 
02:42:48.950 --> 02:42:48.960 align:start position:0%
because the issues that came before you
 
02:42:50.710 --> 02:42:50.720 align:start position:0%
wait a minute i don't i didn't look at
 
02:42:52.070 --> 02:42:52.080 align:start position:0%
that budget i don't know what happened
 
02:42:53.750 --> 02:42:53.760 align:start position:0%
there i don't know whether this is a
 
02:42:55.349 --> 02:42:55.359 align:start position:0%
good transfer a bad transfer i don't
 
02:42:57.830 --> 02:42:57.840 align:start position:0%
know whether it's worthy or not uh and
 
02:43:00.309 --> 02:43:00.319 align:start position:0%
i've never read audits before and so on
 
02:43:01.750 --> 02:43:01.760 align:start position:0%
and so forth and
 
02:43:04.309 --> 02:43:04.319 align:start position:0%
and i think they tried to get off of it
 
02:43:05.750 --> 02:43:05.760 align:start position:0%
the people that had been appointed who
 
02:43:07.990 --> 02:43:08.000 align:start position:0%
were not members of the finance
 
02:43:09.590 --> 02:43:09.600 align:start position:0%
committee either of the house or the
 
02:43:09.600 --> 02:43:10.630 align:start position:0%
committee either of the house or the
senate

02:43:10.630 --> 02:43:10.640 align:start position:0%
senate
 
02:43:12.710 --> 02:43:12.720 align:start position:0%
very important that you have that budget
 
02:43:14.710 --> 02:43:14.720 align:start position:0%
experience when you sit on the fiscal
 
02:43:15.990 --> 02:43:16.000 align:start position:0%
committee because
 
02:43:18.630 --> 02:43:18.640 align:start position:0%
by law the fiscal committee
 
02:43:20.870 --> 02:43:20.880 align:start position:0%
is a
 
02:43:24.309 --> 02:43:24.319 align:start position:0%
creation of the house and the senate
 
02:43:26.230 --> 02:43:26.240 align:start position:0%
to take care of issues when the house
 
02:43:28.950 --> 02:43:28.960 align:start position:0%
and senate are not in session
 
02:43:30.550 --> 02:43:30.560 align:start position:0%
these are bills that would normally come
 
02:43:32.950 --> 02:43:32.960 align:start position:0%
before those two committees
 
02:43:32.960 --> 02:43:34.150 align:start position:0%
before those two committees
so

02:43:34.150 --> 02:43:34.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:43:35.990 --> 02:43:36.000 align:start position:0%
since those two committees are not in
 
02:43:37.429 --> 02:43:37.439 align:start position:0%
session like in
 
02:43:40.469 --> 02:43:40.479 align:start position:0%
june july august september and so on
 
02:43:42.469 --> 02:43:42.479 align:start position:0%
fiscal committee will still meet
 
02:43:45.110 --> 02:43:45.120 align:start position:0%
and so somebody wants to accept a grant
 
02:43:47.349 --> 02:43:47.359 align:start position:0%
they can't spend that money
 
02:43:47.359 --> 02:43:48.550 align:start position:0%
they can't spend that money
unless

02:43:48.550 --> 02:43:48.560 align:start position:0%
unless
 
02:43:51.190 --> 02:43:51.200 align:start position:0%
the legislature appropriates it
 
02:43:51.200 --> 02:43:52.389 align:start position:0%
the legislature appropriates it
so

02:43:52.389 --> 02:43:52.399 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:43:53.910 --> 02:43:53.920 align:start position:0%
the fiscal committee serves as the
 
02:43:56.870 --> 02:43:56.880 align:start position:0%
appropriating body by the law that sets
 
02:43:57.990 --> 02:43:58.000 align:start position:0%
them up
 
02:44:00.950 --> 02:44:00.960 align:start position:0%
so it kind of gives it a little bit of
 
02:44:02.790 --> 02:44:02.800 align:start position:0%
leeway over what would normally be the
 
02:44:02.800 --> 02:44:03.670 align:start position:0%
leeway over what would normally be the
case

02:44:03.670 --> 02:44:03.680 align:start position:0%
case
 
02:44:05.190 --> 02:44:05.200 align:start position:0%
money can't be spent unless it's
 
02:44:05.200 --> 02:44:06.469 align:start position:0%
money can't be spent unless it's
appropriated

02:44:06.469 --> 02:44:06.479 align:start position:0%
appropriated
 
02:44:07.670 --> 02:44:07.680 align:start position:0%
the appropriating body is the
 
02:44:09.830 --> 02:44:09.840 align:start position:0%
legislature so
 
02:44:13.030 --> 02:44:13.040 align:start position:0%
we are kind of the designees for that
 
02:44:15.030 --> 02:44:15.040 align:start position:0%
particular those particular months and
 
02:44:18.309 --> 02:44:18.319 align:start position:0%
even some of the intervening months so
 
02:44:20.230 --> 02:44:20.240 align:start position:0%
i i don't want to get
 
02:44:23.190 --> 02:44:23.200 align:start position:0%
it to become too political
 
02:44:25.910 --> 02:44:25.920 align:start position:0%
and i i see the bill as doing that
 
02:44:27.990 --> 02:44:28.000 align:start position:0%
and i think it will
 
02:44:28.000 --> 02:44:30.070 align:start position:0%
and i think it will
maybe

02:44:30.070 --> 02:44:30.080 align:start position:0%
maybe
 
02:44:31.990 --> 02:44:32.000 align:start position:0%
make it more difficult for the committee
 
02:44:34.870 --> 02:44:34.880 align:start position:0%
to function if they don't have
 
02:44:37.510 --> 02:44:37.520 align:start position:0%
all 10 people familiar with the budget
 
02:44:37.520 --> 02:44:38.630 align:start position:0%
all 10 people familiar with the budget
so

02:44:38.630 --> 02:44:38.640 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:44:41.190 --> 02:44:41.200 align:start position:0%
that's why i oppose the bill thank you
 
02:44:42.710 --> 02:44:42.720 align:start position:0%
thank you for any questions
 
02:44:45.349 --> 02:44:45.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:48.230 --> 02:44:48.240 align:start position:0%
you may guess that there is one question
 
02:44:50.309 --> 02:44:50.319 align:start position:0%
at this at least i always appreciate it
 
02:44:53.670 --> 02:44:53.680 align:start position:0%
that is inquiring minds wanted
 
02:44:55.349 --> 02:44:55.359 align:start position:0%
representative roulard thank you for
 
02:44:58.870 --> 02:44:58.880 align:start position:0%
taking my question of course um
 
02:45:00.950 --> 02:45:00.960 align:start position:0%
i i appreciate your testimony because
 
02:45:02.870 --> 02:45:02.880 align:start position:0%
when i was reading this i was thinking
 
02:45:04.790 --> 02:45:04.800 align:start position:0%
the same thing we need to have people
 
02:45:04.800 --> 02:45:05.670 align:start position:0%
the same thing we need to have people
that

02:45:05.670 --> 02:45:05.680 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:45:07.349 --> 02:45:07.359 align:start position:0%
know what finance is all about and what
 
02:45:09.190 --> 02:45:09.200 align:start position:0%
we're dealing with
 
02:45:11.670 --> 02:45:11.680 align:start position:0%
but also thinking that at some point the
 
02:45:14.150 --> 02:45:14.160 align:start position:0%
party that i'm in now maybe the minority
 
02:45:16.309 --> 02:45:16.319 align:start position:0%
party at one point
 
02:45:18.309 --> 02:45:18.319 align:start position:0%
um which is a way i have a tendency to
 
02:45:19.429 --> 02:45:19.439 align:start position:0%
look at things
 
02:45:19.439 --> 02:45:20.710 align:start position:0%
look at things
so

02:45:20.710 --> 02:45:20.720 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:45:22.309 --> 02:45:22.319 align:start position:0%
wouldn't it be
 
02:45:25.670 --> 02:45:25.680 align:start position:0%
fair to have the chairperson of finance
 
02:45:28.389 --> 02:45:28.399 align:start position:0%
a point because the them they're on it
 
02:45:30.870 --> 02:45:30.880 align:start position:0%
already appoint two members of minority
 
02:45:33.750 --> 02:45:33.760 align:start position:0%
and two members of a majority
 
02:45:35.030 --> 02:45:35.040 align:start position:0%
and they have the senate do the same
 
02:45:35.040 --> 02:45:38.469 align:start position:0%
and they have the senate do the same
thing

02:45:38.469 --> 02:45:38.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:39.750 --> 02:45:39.760 align:start position:0%
i think you take away some of the
 
02:45:42.230 --> 02:45:42.240 align:start position:0%
flexibility there might be people you're
 
02:45:44.070 --> 02:45:44.080 align:start position:0%
familiar with all the people and if
 
02:45:45.429 --> 02:45:45.439 align:start position:0%
you're the chairman of financial they're
 
02:45:47.030 --> 02:45:47.040 align:start position:0%
familiar with all the people there and
 
02:45:47.040 --> 02:45:47.910 align:start position:0%
familiar with all the people there and
some

02:45:47.910 --> 02:45:47.920 align:start position:0%
some
 
02:45:49.269 --> 02:45:49.279 align:start position:0%
some are in deep thought some are
 
02:45:52.630 --> 02:45:52.640 align:start position:0%
filling a seat and you say okay uh
 
02:45:53.590 --> 02:45:53.600 align:start position:0%
you know
 
02:45:55.750 --> 02:45:55.760 align:start position:0%
who's who's gonna function best on this
 
02:45:55.760 --> 02:45:56.550 align:start position:0%
who's who's gonna function best on this
or

02:45:56.550 --> 02:45:56.560 align:start position:0%
or
 
02:45:58.469 --> 02:45:58.479 align:start position:0%
there might be people that have poor
 
02:45:58.479 --> 02:46:00.469 align:start position:0%
there might be people that have poor
attendance

02:46:00.469 --> 02:46:00.479 align:start position:0%
attendance
 
02:46:02.469 --> 02:46:02.479 align:start position:0%
at even your regular committee why would
 
02:46:04.070 --> 02:46:04.080 align:start position:0%
why would i want to put that person
 
02:46:05.830 --> 02:46:05.840 align:start position:0%
there when i'm always having to fill in
 
02:46:07.590 --> 02:46:07.600 align:start position:0%
for them and they're not and they're not
 
02:46:09.190 --> 02:46:09.200 align:start position:0%
reading the material they're not keeping
 
02:46:10.790 --> 02:46:10.800 align:start position:0%
up because there's sometimes there's a
 
02:46:12.630 --> 02:46:12.640 align:start position:0%
pile of stuff like this
 
02:46:14.710 --> 02:46:14.720 align:start position:0%
that you have to read you get it a week
 
02:46:16.150 --> 02:46:16.160 align:start position:0%
in advance
 
02:46:18.630 --> 02:46:18.640 align:start position:0%
so you're familiar with who really gets
 
02:46:20.950 --> 02:46:20.960 align:start position:0%
into the material and who just kind of
 
02:46:23.830 --> 02:46:23.840 align:start position:0%
says yeah okay i got it here somewhere
 
02:46:26.230 --> 02:46:26.240 align:start position:0%
i can't find it you know so
 
02:46:27.990 --> 02:46:28.000 align:start position:0%
i'm looking at people that really do the
 
02:46:29.910 --> 02:46:29.920 align:start position:0%
job rather than
 
02:46:32.150 --> 02:46:32.160 align:start position:0%
and and i would appoint democrats that i
 
02:46:32.160 --> 02:46:33.429 align:start position:0%
and and i would appoint democrats that i
knew

02:46:33.429 --> 02:46:33.439 align:start position:0%
knew
 
02:46:34.630 --> 02:46:34.640 align:start position:0%
did a study
 
02:46:34.640 --> 02:46:35.349 align:start position:0%
did a study
and

02:46:35.349 --> 02:46:35.359 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:46:37.110 --> 02:46:37.120 align:start position:0%
were right up on the on the budget and
 
02:46:39.910 --> 02:46:39.920 align:start position:0%
had had been working hard and had had
 
02:46:41.429 --> 02:46:41.439 align:start position:0%
that way of
 
02:46:42.950 --> 02:46:42.960 align:start position:0%
keeping up with
 
02:46:44.710 --> 02:46:44.720 align:start position:0%
not only the budget but the changes to
 
02:46:46.870 --> 02:46:46.880 align:start position:0%
it and the reasons why we do what we do
 
02:46:46.880 --> 02:46:47.590 align:start position:0%
it and the reasons why we do what we do
and

02:46:47.590 --> 02:46:47.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:46:49.670 --> 02:46:49.680 align:start position:0%
i'd always appreciate experience that
 
02:46:52.630 --> 02:46:52.640 align:start position:0%
had people that had been on the fiscal
 
02:46:54.870 --> 02:46:54.880 align:start position:0%
committee with before
 
02:46:56.710 --> 02:46:56.720 align:start position:0%
and had seen them operate
 
02:46:59.110 --> 02:46:59.120 align:start position:0%
but if you just kind of make it you've
 
02:47:02.230 --> 02:47:02.240 align:start position:0%
got a point two minority two majority
 
02:47:03.590 --> 02:47:03.600 align:start position:0%
i think it it
 
02:47:05.910 --> 02:47:05.920 align:start position:0%
takes away some flexibility from the
 
02:47:08.150 --> 02:47:08.160 align:start position:0%
person who want to know
 
02:47:10.630 --> 02:47:10.640 align:start position:0%
of the 20 people i'm looking at
 
02:47:13.429 --> 02:47:13.439 align:start position:0%
which ones are going to work thank you
 
02:47:15.510 --> 02:47:15.520 align:start position:0%
thank you uh question representative
 
02:47:18.389 --> 02:47:18.399 align:start position:0%
simon thank you mr chair um in that same
 
02:47:19.990 --> 02:47:20.000 align:start position:0%
vein would it make more sense than to
 
02:47:21.429 --> 02:47:21.439 align:start position:0%
have the committee chair choose two
 
02:47:23.750 --> 02:47:23.760 align:start position:0%
people and the ranking member choose two
 
02:47:25.830 --> 02:47:25.840 align:start position:0%
people that way the person of the
 
02:47:27.910 --> 02:47:27.920 align:start position:0%
minority party would be well acquainted
 
02:47:29.510 --> 02:47:29.520 align:start position:0%
with everything that's going on and able
 
02:47:33.110 --> 02:47:33.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:35.110 --> 02:47:35.120 align:start position:0%
again it comes down to sometimes the
 
02:47:36.790 --> 02:47:36.800 align:start position:0%
ranking member
 
02:47:38.870 --> 02:47:38.880 align:start position:0%
is not the the busiest person on the
 
02:47:40.870 --> 02:47:40.880 align:start position:0%
committee they're not
 
02:47:42.469 --> 02:47:42.479 align:start position:0%
they're there because they're they've
 
02:47:44.150 --> 02:47:44.160 align:start position:0%
been there longer than anybody else and
 
02:47:46.150 --> 02:47:46.160 align:start position:0%
they're kind of losing it
 
02:47:49.269 --> 02:47:49.279 align:start position:0%
but hey there's nobody senior to me i i
 
02:47:50.389 --> 02:47:50.399 align:start position:0%
deserve it
 
02:47:52.790 --> 02:47:52.800 align:start position:0%
and like i say i'm i'm i would be
 
02:47:55.349 --> 02:47:55.359 align:start position:0%
looking for people that i know would
 
02:47:57.349 --> 02:47:57.359 align:start position:0%
go through that in a week
 
02:47:57.359 --> 02:47:58.550 align:start position:0%
go through that in a week
and

02:47:58.550 --> 02:47:58.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:48:00.469 --> 02:48:00.479 align:start position:0%
be ready to ask questions and be ready
 
02:48:02.469 --> 02:48:02.479 align:start position:0%
to to
 
02:48:05.110 --> 02:48:05.120 align:start position:0%
contribute in a thoughtful way of what
 
02:48:07.190 --> 02:48:07.200 align:start position:0%
we ought to do with this so
 
02:48:09.830 --> 02:48:09.840 align:start position:0%
it i think it it's worked fine the way
 
02:48:10.870 --> 02:48:10.880 align:start position:0%
it is
 
02:48:10.880 --> 02:48:13.110 align:start position:0%
it is
uh

02:48:13.110 --> 02:48:13.120 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:48:14.790 --> 02:48:14.800 align:start position:0%
next time i would try to go back to
 
02:48:16.710 --> 02:48:16.720 align:start position:0%
three and two again
 
02:48:18.950 --> 02:48:18.960 align:start position:0%
but you know that was kind of okay they
 
02:48:20.870 --> 02:48:20.880 align:start position:0%
did that the last time we'll do it this
 
02:48:23.030 --> 02:48:23.040 align:start position:0%
uh i don't want to get into that
 
02:48:23.040 --> 02:48:24.389 align:start position:0%
uh i don't want to get into that
but

02:48:24.389 --> 02:48:24.399 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:48:25.750 --> 02:48:25.760 align:start position:0%
i know that there's
 
02:48:25.760 --> 02:48:26.790 align:start position:0%
i know that there's
there's

02:48:26.790 --> 02:48:26.800 align:start position:0%
there's
 
02:48:28.389 --> 02:48:28.399 align:start position:0%
two members of the minority party that i
 
02:48:30.469 --> 02:48:30.479 align:start position:0%
would in an instance say yes those
 
02:48:33.510 --> 02:48:33.520 align:start position:0%
people do the work they do the study
 
02:48:35.910 --> 02:48:35.920 align:start position:0%
let's have them on there because
 
02:48:37.670 --> 02:48:37.680 align:start position:0%
it's not always partisan
 
02:48:39.110 --> 02:48:39.120 align:start position:0%
there's lots of things that you have to
 
02:48:40.230 --> 02:48:40.240 align:start position:0%
figure out
 
02:48:42.150 --> 02:48:42.160 align:start position:0%
why do we want this grant what's the
 
02:48:43.429 --> 02:48:43.439 align:start position:0%
effect of it
 
02:48:45.269 --> 02:48:45.279 align:start position:0%
and you know like
 
02:48:47.510 --> 02:48:47.520 align:start position:0%
the hassle i got into because
 
02:48:49.269 --> 02:48:49.279 align:start position:0%
it was this money
 
02:48:51.670 --> 02:48:51.680 align:start position:0%
i i thought everybody that wanted a shot
 
02:48:53.110 --> 02:48:53.120 align:start position:0%
could get one
 
02:48:55.190 --> 02:48:55.200 align:start position:0%
and all of a sudden were offered two
 
02:48:57.830 --> 02:48:57.840 align:start position:0%
different grants the total 27 million
 
02:49:00.309 --> 02:49:00.319 align:start position:0%
but we got to hire 15 more people
 
02:49:00.319 --> 02:49:01.349 align:start position:0%
but we got to hire 15 more people
and

02:49:01.349 --> 02:49:01.359 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:49:03.110 --> 02:49:03.120 align:start position:0%
one of the things that i didn't want to
 
02:49:04.550 --> 02:49:04.560 align:start position:0%
give up the sovereignty of the state
 
02:49:04.560 --> 02:49:05.590 align:start position:0%
give up the sovereignty of the state
said

02:49:05.590 --> 02:49:05.600 align:start position:0%
said
 
02:49:08.630 --> 02:49:08.640 align:start position:0%
you will comply with all federal health
 
02:49:11.750 --> 02:49:11.760 align:start position:0%
and human stat health and human services
 
02:49:11.760 --> 02:49:13.670 align:start position:0%
and human stat health and human services
rules

02:49:13.670 --> 02:49:13.680 align:start position:0%
rules
 
02:49:17.190 --> 02:49:17.200 align:start position:0%
that are present now or in the future
 
02:49:19.110 --> 02:49:19.120 align:start position:0%
and also you will have
 
02:49:19.120 --> 02:49:20.230 align:start position:0%
and also you will have
state

02:49:20.230 --> 02:49:20.240 align:start position:0%
state
 
02:49:22.070 --> 02:49:22.080 align:start position:0%
enforcement people
 
02:49:24.790 --> 02:49:24.800 align:start position:0%
cooperate with federal agents who might
 
02:49:27.269 --> 02:49:27.279 align:start position:0%
want to isolate people or quarantine
 
02:49:30.150 --> 02:49:30.160 align:start position:0%
people wait a minute
 
02:49:32.150 --> 02:49:32.160 align:start position:0%
if if the federal government says to us
 
02:49:33.429 --> 02:49:33.439 align:start position:0%
we're going to go out and arrest
 
02:49:34.950 --> 02:49:34.960 align:start position:0%
everybody that hasn't had the shot and
 
02:49:36.469 --> 02:49:36.479 align:start position:0%
put him in a camp
 
02:49:39.349 --> 02:49:39.359 align:start position:0%
like australia
 
02:49:41.349 --> 02:49:41.359 align:start position:0%
that's not something live free or die
 
02:49:43.190 --> 02:49:43.200 align:start position:0%
state would ever put up with
 
02:49:43.200 --> 02:49:43.910 align:start position:0%
state would ever put up with
but

02:49:43.910 --> 02:49:43.920 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:49:45.830 --> 02:49:45.840 align:start position:0%
if you took this money you're more or
 
02:49:45.840 --> 02:49:46.870 align:start position:0%
if you took this money you're more or
less

02:49:46.870 --> 02:49:46.880 align:start position:0%
less
 
02:49:49.190 --> 02:49:49.200 align:start position:0%
saying you're going to help them
 
02:49:49.200 --> 02:49:49.990 align:start position:0%
saying you're going to help them
and

02:49:49.990 --> 02:49:50.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:49:52.070 --> 02:49:52.080 align:start position:0%
i said no i don't think we should give
 
02:49:54.469 --> 02:49:54.479 align:start position:0%
up our sovereignty and most of the
 
02:49:56.870 --> 02:49:56.880 align:start position:0%
committee agreed with that so
 
02:49:58.230 --> 02:49:58.240 align:start position:0%
there are things that you have to read
 
02:50:01.110 --> 02:50:01.120 align:start position:0%
the fine print of what goes along with
 
02:50:03.910 --> 02:50:03.920 align:start position:0%
you know like sometimes it was like okay
 
02:50:06.309 --> 02:50:06.319 align:start position:0%
if you take this highway money then we
 
02:50:07.990 --> 02:50:08.000 align:start position:0%
will tell you what the speed limit will
 
02:50:08.000 --> 02:50:09.429 align:start position:0%
will tell you what the speed limit will
be

02:50:09.429 --> 02:50:09.439 align:start position:0%
be
 
02:50:11.750 --> 02:50:11.760 align:start position:0%
do we want to give that over to the feds
 
02:50:12.950 --> 02:50:12.960 align:start position:0%
i don't know
 
02:50:15.590 --> 02:50:15.600 align:start position:0%
we've done it but
 
02:50:17.269 --> 02:50:17.279 align:start position:0%
you know there is something
 
02:50:19.670 --> 02:50:19.680 align:start position:0%
nothing comes without strings
 
02:50:19.680 --> 02:50:20.630 align:start position:0%
nothing comes without strings
so

02:50:20.630 --> 02:50:20.640 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:50:22.389 --> 02:50:22.399 align:start position:0%
you have to do the study and see what's
 
02:50:23.990 --> 02:50:24.000 align:start position:0%
going to happen if we take this grant
 
02:50:26.389 --> 02:50:26.399 align:start position:0%
and and if if the committee members have
 
02:50:28.790 --> 02:50:28.800 align:start position:0%
not done the study because there might
 
02:50:31.349 --> 02:50:31.359 align:start position:0%
be 100 items
 
02:50:31.359 --> 02:50:32.309 align:start position:0%
be 100 items
and

02:50:32.309 --> 02:50:32.319 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:50:33.670 --> 02:50:33.680 align:start position:0%
you don't want to overlook anything
 
02:50:35.510 --> 02:50:35.520 align:start position:0%
important like that so
 
02:50:35.520 --> 02:50:36.790 align:start position:0%
important like that so
i

02:50:36.790 --> 02:50:36.800 align:start position:0%
i
 
02:50:38.389 --> 02:50:38.399 align:start position:0%
try to rule with people that i know will
 
02:50:40.870 --> 02:50:40.880 align:start position:0%
do this study thank you
 
02:50:41.990 --> 02:50:42.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:50:44.070 --> 02:50:44.080 align:start position:0%
no further questions i think we're all
 
02:50:46.309 --> 02:50:46.319 align:start position:0%
set thank you very much representative
 
02:50:46.319 --> 02:50:47.590 align:start position:0%
set thank you very much representative
weiler

02:50:47.590 --> 02:50:47.600 align:start position:0%
weiler
 
02:50:49.269 --> 02:50:49.279 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:50:53.429 --> 02:50:53.439 align:start position:0%
with that i will close the hearing on
 
02:50:55.910 --> 02:50:55.920 align:start position:0%
11 29
 
02:50:55.920 --> 02:50:57.750 align:start position:0%
11 29
and

02:50:57.750 --> 02:50:57.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:50:59.349 --> 02:50:59.359 align:start position:0%
i don't
 
02:51:03.429 --> 02:51:03.439 align:start position:0%
know if we have anyone to introduce
 
02:51:08.870 --> 02:51:08.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:12.070 --> 02:51:12.080 align:start position:0%
so do we take an early lunch
 
02:51:16.469 --> 02:51:16.479 align:start position:0%
and hope that they show up after lunch
 
02:51:18.070 --> 02:51:18.080 align:start position:0%
that would be the courteous thing to do
 
02:51:19.670 --> 02:51:19.680 align:start position:0%
would it not
 
02:51:23.030 --> 02:51:23.040 align:start position:0%
are you um no one is here for 11 54
 
02:51:23.040 --> 02:51:23.910 align:start position:0%
are you um no one is here for 11 54

paul smith house clerk uh not testifying
 
02:53:04.469 --> 02:53:04.479 align:start position:0%
in support or opposition i just wanted
 
02:53:06.070 --> 02:53:06.080 align:start position:0%
to point a couple of quick things out
 
02:53:06.080 --> 02:53:06.950 align:start position:0%
to point a couple of quick things out
one

02:53:06.950 --> 02:53:06.960 align:start position:0%
one
 
02:53:06.960 --> 02:53:08.230 align:start position:0%
one
um

02:53:08.230 --> 02:53:08.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:53:10.950 --> 02:53:10.960 align:start position:0%
the focus of this uh this particular
 
02:53:12.550 --> 02:53:12.560 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation is also addressed
 
02:53:15.269 --> 02:53:15.279 align:start position:0%
in upcoming legislation but this is much
 
02:53:17.590 --> 02:53:17.600 align:start position:0%
more restrictive and i would only note
 
02:53:17.600 --> 02:53:18.389 align:start position:0%
more restrictive and i would only note
that

02:53:18.389 --> 02:53:18.399 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:53:21.349 --> 02:53:21.359 align:start position:0%
um some of the language of this
 
02:53:22.790 --> 02:53:22.800 align:start position:0%
we have to keep in mind that the
 
02:53:24.710 --> 02:53:24.720 align:start position:0%
pandemic is going on and has been going
 
02:53:26.469 --> 02:53:26.479 align:start position:0%
on for the last two years and some of
 
02:53:29.110 --> 02:53:29.120 align:start position:0%
our committees and commissions that have
 
02:53:32.230 --> 02:53:32.240 align:start position:0%
been historically active in the past
 
02:53:35.110 --> 02:53:35.120 align:start position:0%
and i see representative barry coming in
 
02:53:37.510 --> 02:53:37.520 align:start position:0%
some of our his some of our commissions
 
02:53:38.790 --> 02:53:38.800 align:start position:0%
and committees that have been very
 
02:53:40.870 --> 02:53:40.880 align:start position:0%
active historically because of the
 
02:53:43.429 --> 02:53:43.439 align:start position:0%
pandemic have not been as
 
02:53:46.469 --> 02:53:46.479 align:start position:0%
uh active in this past year and a half
 
02:53:48.309 --> 02:53:48.319 align:start position:0%
and i would just note that a look back
 
02:53:50.870 --> 02:53:50.880 align:start position:0%
of only one year um
 
02:53:53.590 --> 02:53:53.600 align:start position:0%
in in measuring the multitude of
 
02:53:55.670 --> 02:53:55.680 align:start position:0%
committees and commissions we have may
 
02:53:57.750 --> 02:53:57.760 align:start position:0%
be a little bit on the short-sighted
 
02:54:00.710 --> 02:54:00.720 align:start position:0%
aspect and that's why um again the the
 
02:54:02.630 --> 02:54:02.640 align:start position:0%
this this subject matter is addressed a
 
02:54:04.469 --> 02:54:04.479 align:start position:0%
little bit later in house bill 1269
 
02:54:06.150 --> 02:54:06.160 align:start position:0%
which i think
 
02:54:07.830 --> 02:54:07.840 align:start position:0%
does do a little bit further of a look
 
02:54:10.710 --> 02:54:10.720 align:start position:0%
back and actually puts a time limit on
 
02:54:12.070 --> 02:54:12.080 align:start position:0%
on committees and commissions as well
 
02:54:14.389 --> 02:54:14.399 align:start position:0%
which i think is a very good thing so i
 
02:54:15.830 --> 02:54:15.840 align:start position:0%
just wanted to throw that in there for
 
02:54:17.349 --> 02:54:17.359 align:start position:0%
consideration thank you
 
02:54:21.429 --> 02:54:21.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:26.150 --> 02:54:26.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:28.710 --> 02:54:28.720 align:start position:0%
oh look we have the prime sponsor i'm

legislative committees um
 
02:55:01.190 --> 02:55:01.200 align:start position:0%
um but the bill is not ready for prime
 
02:55:03.030 --> 02:55:03.040 align:start position:0%
time unfortunately i ran out of time to
 
02:55:05.190 --> 02:55:05.200 align:start position:0%
really get to where i needed to go
 
02:55:06.309 --> 02:55:06.319 align:start position:0%
it's a vehicle that's obviously
 
02:55:07.590 --> 02:55:07.600 align:start position:0%
available for the committee should you
 
02:55:10.150 --> 02:55:10.160 align:start position:0%
use it my intent in filing it
 
02:55:12.230 --> 02:55:12.240 align:start position:0%
was we have if you ever look at the the
 
02:55:13.670 --> 02:55:13.680 align:start position:0%
house calendar that the wonderful clerk
 
02:55:16.150 --> 02:55:16.160 align:start position:0%
cover puts together we have umpteen
 
02:55:18.550 --> 02:55:18.560 align:start position:0%
billion um study committees and this
 
02:55:20.710 --> 02:55:20.720 align:start position:0%
committee and that committee um a lot of
 
02:55:22.309 --> 02:55:22.319 align:start position:0%
them don't even meet anymore the
 
02:55:23.990 --> 02:55:24.000 align:start position:0%
speaker's office then has to fill these
 
02:55:24.000 --> 02:55:25.429 align:start position:0%
speaker's office then has to fill these
commissions

02:55:25.429 --> 02:55:25.439 align:start position:0%
commissions
 
02:55:26.950 --> 02:55:26.960 align:start position:0%
so it was not a
 
02:55:28.710 --> 02:55:28.720 align:start position:0%
there was a
 
02:55:31.190 --> 02:55:31.200 align:start position:0%
admittedly an issue
 
02:55:33.110 --> 02:55:33.120 align:start position:0%
when when i thought of the idea that i
 
02:55:34.710 --> 02:55:34.720 align:start position:0%
didn't fully think it out of which is i
 
02:55:36.070 --> 02:55:36.080 align:start position:0%
wanted to be forward-looking but you
 
02:55:37.190 --> 02:55:37.200 align:start position:0%
can't make legislation that's
 
02:55:38.790 --> 02:55:38.800 align:start position:0%
forward-looking on other legislation on
 
02:55:41.510 --> 02:55:41.520 align:start position:0%
other future committees so um when i
 
02:55:44.230 --> 02:55:44.240 align:start position:0%
when i realized i had done that horrible
 
02:55:44.240 --> 02:55:45.110 align:start position:0%
when i realized i had done that horrible
uh

02:55:45.110 --> 02:55:45.120 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:55:45.120 --> 02:55:45.990 align:start position:0%
uh
uh

02:55:45.990 --> 02:55:46.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:55:47.590 --> 02:55:47.600 align:start position:0%
assault on the constitution if you will
 
02:55:49.910 --> 02:55:49.920 align:start position:0%
and i went oh well this is uh this idea
 
02:55:52.070 --> 02:55:52.080 align:start position:0%
will needs more thinking i said i ran
 
02:55:54.389 --> 02:55:54.399 align:start position:0%
out of time so the the vehicle exists
 
02:55:56.790 --> 02:55:56.800 align:start position:0%
that was my intent um but um anybody who
 
02:55:57.990 --> 02:55:58.000 align:start position:0%
speaks after me is probably wasting
 
02:55:59.349 --> 02:55:59.359 align:start position:0%
their time because if this goes on the
 
02:56:01.110 --> 02:56:01.120 align:start position:0%
consent calendar to die
 
02:56:04.950 --> 02:56:04.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:06.870 --> 02:56:06.880 align:start position:0%

04:01:22.630 --> 04:01:22.640 align:start position:0%
to your own committee
 
04:01:24.070 --> 04:01:24.080 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and members of the
 
04:01:25.750 --> 04:01:25.760 align:start position:0%
committee for the record uh my name is
 
04:01:27.590 --> 04:01:27.600 align:start position:0%
representative scott wallace i represent
 
04:01:29.670 --> 04:01:29.680 align:start position:0%
the town of danville rockingham county
 
04:01:32.389 --> 04:01:32.399 align:start position:0%
district 12.
 
04:01:35.110 --> 04:01:35.120 align:start position:0%
i'm introducing house bill 1170
 
04:01:36.790 --> 04:01:36.800 align:start position:0%
this bill would establish procedure for
 
04:01:38.870 --> 04:01:38.880 align:start position:0%
the selection of delegates to
 
04:01:41.590 --> 04:01:41.600 align:start position:0%
article 5 and interstate conventions
 
04:01:44.309 --> 04:01:44.319 align:start position:0%
policy making conventions that is
 
04:01:47.590 --> 04:01:47.600 align:start position:0%
absent this particular bill there are no
 
04:01:50.790 --> 04:01:50.800 align:start position:0%
methods of disciplining or reining in a
 
04:01:53.189 --> 04:01:53.199 align:start position:0%
rogue delegate um
 
04:01:55.030 --> 04:01:55.040 align:start position:0%
at one of these conventions um
 
04:01:57.110 --> 04:01:57.120 align:start position:0%
historically we found that
 
04:01:59.030 --> 04:01:59.040 align:start position:0%
we seem to be reluctant to move forward
 
04:02:01.349 --> 04:02:01.359 align:start position:0%
with any of these conventions absent
 
04:02:04.870 --> 04:02:04.880 align:start position:0%
ground rules for the delegates
 
04:02:07.510 --> 04:02:07.520 align:start position:0%
this particular bill is
 
04:02:09.429 --> 04:02:09.439 align:start position:0%
not quite verbatim but very close to
 
04:02:12.389 --> 04:02:12.399 align:start position:0%
house bill 148 that passed both the
 
04:02:16.070 --> 04:02:16.080 align:start position:0%
house and the senate back in 2015
 
04:02:17.750 --> 04:02:17.760 align:start position:0%
it was actually on the consent calendar
 
04:02:19.110 --> 04:02:19.120 align:start position:0%
on the house floor
 
04:02:20.870 --> 04:02:20.880 align:start position:0%
was pulled off consent by representative
 
04:02:24.469 --> 04:02:24.479 align:start position:0%
horrigan but subsequently passed with a
 
04:02:24.479 --> 04:02:25.309 align:start position:0%
horrigan but subsequently passed with a
a

04:02:25.309 --> 04:02:25.319 align:start position:0%
a
 
04:02:28.950 --> 04:02:28.960 align:start position:0%
233-76 vote again passed the senate on a
 
04:02:30.550 --> 04:02:30.560 align:start position:0%
voice vote consent calendar and was
 
04:02:32.070 --> 04:02:32.080 align:start position:0%
subsequently vetoed by the governor at
 
04:02:33.910 --> 04:02:33.920 align:start position:0%
that point in time
 
04:02:38.229 --> 04:02:38.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:40.790 --> 04:02:40.800 align:start position:0%
and is we're getting closer to an
 
04:02:43.030 --> 04:02:43.040 align:start position:0%
article 5 call nationally
 
04:02:45.030 --> 04:02:45.040 align:start position:0%
presently there are approximately 27 or
 
04:02:45.040 --> 04:02:46.229 align:start position:0%
presently there are approximately 27 or
28

04:02:46.229 --> 04:02:46.239 align:start position:0%
28
 
04:02:49.030 --> 04:02:49.040 align:start position:0%
states that have a concurrent resolution
 
04:02:50.790 --> 04:02:50.800 align:start position:0%
for proposing a
 
04:02:52.389 --> 04:02:52.399 align:start position:0%
balanced budget amendment to the u.s
 
04:02:52.399 --> 04:02:53.670 align:start position:0%
balanced budget amendment to the u.s
constitution

04:02:53.670 --> 04:02:53.680 align:start position:0%
constitution
 
04:02:56.309 --> 04:02:56.319 align:start position:0%
uh there are at least four or five
 
04:02:58.710 --> 04:02:58.720 align:start position:0%
states pending presently so
 
04:03:00.150 --> 04:03:00.160 align:start position:0%
if those states would have these
 
04:03:02.309 --> 04:03:02.319 align:start position:0%
concurrent resolutions passed this year
 
04:03:04.469 --> 04:03:04.479 align:start position:0%
um the convention would be called and we
 
04:03:05.910 --> 04:03:05.920 align:start position:0%
would need to have these ground rules in
 
04:03:08.150 --> 04:03:08.160 align:start position:0%
place for the delegates that we select
 
04:03:10.150 --> 04:03:10.160 align:start position:0%
to represent our interest at the
 
04:03:11.830 --> 04:03:11.840 align:start position:0%
national convention
 
04:03:11.840 --> 04:03:12.710 align:start position:0%
national convention
um

04:03:12.710 --> 04:03:12.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:03:13.830 --> 04:03:13.840 align:start position:0%
that being said it's pretty
 
04:03:16.550 --> 04:03:16.560 align:start position:0%
straightforward uh again it
 
04:03:19.670 --> 04:03:19.680 align:start position:0%
was debated quite extensively uh
 
04:03:22.389 --> 04:03:22.399 align:start position:0%
six or seven years ago and uh
 
04:03:24.150 --> 04:03:24.160 align:start position:0%
made it through the house and senate but
 
04:03:26.229 --> 04:03:26.239 align:start position:0%
was vetoed by the governor so that's
 
04:03:27.990 --> 04:03:28.000 align:start position:0%
where at this point in time i'd be more
 
04:03:29.990 --> 04:03:30.000 align:start position:0%
than happy to take any questions thank
 
04:03:31.750 --> 04:03:31.760 align:start position:0%

04:03:34.630 --> 04:03:34.640 align:start position:0%
one quick request by the chair um
 
04:03:36.389 --> 04:03:36.399 align:start position:0%

04:03:39.590 --> 04:03:39.600 align:start position:0%
to the committee the veto message um
 
04:03:42.710 --> 04:03:42.720 align:start position:0%
that came from house bill 148
 
04:03:44.229 --> 04:03:44.239 align:start position:0%
i will get that
 
04:03:45.990 --> 04:03:46.000 align:start position:0%

hudson and pelham
 
04:04:33.349 --> 04:04:33.359 align:start position:0%
interestingly enough new hampshire has
 
04:04:35.110 --> 04:04:35.120 align:start position:0%
already attended a convention of the
 
04:04:35.120 --> 04:04:36.630 align:start position:0%
already attended a convention of the
states

04:04:36.630 --> 04:04:36.640 align:start position:0%
states
 
04:04:38.950 --> 04:04:38.960 align:start position:0%
this was the phoenix
 
04:04:38.960 --> 04:04:40.229 align:start position:0%
this was the phoenix
meeting

04:04:40.229 --> 04:04:40.239 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
04:04:43.349 --> 04:04:43.359 align:start position:0%
several years ago and where rules for an
 
04:04:45.910 --> 04:04:45.920 align:start position:0%
article 5 convention were
 
04:04:45.920 --> 04:04:47.110 align:start position:0%
article 5 convention were
devised

04:04:47.110 --> 04:04:47.120 align:start position:0%
devised
 
04:04:48.710 --> 04:04:48.720 align:start position:0%
both the speaker and the president of
 
04:04:50.389 --> 04:04:50.399 align:start position:0%
the house at the time selected
 
04:04:52.070 --> 04:04:52.080 align:start position:0%
individuals to go i was one of the
 
04:04:54.309 --> 04:04:54.319 align:start position:0%
individuals selected to go
 
04:04:55.710 --> 04:04:55.720 align:start position:0%
it was interesting
 
04:04:58.950 --> 04:04:58.960 align:start position:0%
130 degrees in the shade
 
04:05:02.389 --> 04:05:02.399 align:start position:0%
because they did it in august dry heat
 
04:05:05.189 --> 04:05:05.199 align:start position:0%
it was warm
 
04:05:05.199 --> 04:05:06.550 align:start position:0%
it was warm
the

04:05:06.550 --> 04:05:06.560 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:05:09.030 --> 04:05:09.040 align:start position:0%
per the need for this is as was
 
04:05:10.950 --> 04:05:10.960 align:start position:0%
indicated there are some 28 states that
 
04:05:13.510 --> 04:05:13.520 align:start position:0%
have got a complete package done under
 
04:05:16.630 --> 04:05:16.640 align:start position:0%
the balanced budget amendment
 
04:05:20.150 --> 04:05:20.160 align:start position:0%
there are another five or so
 
04:05:23.189 --> 04:05:23.199 align:start position:0%
states that are
 
04:05:23.199 --> 04:05:24.790 align:start position:0%
states that are
considering

04:05:24.790 --> 04:05:24.800 align:start position:0%
considering
 
04:05:26.550 --> 04:05:26.560 align:start position:0%
a balanced budget amendment and there's
 
04:05:28.790 --> 04:05:28.800 align:start position:0%
a couple that have
 
04:05:30.469 --> 04:05:30.479 align:start position:0%
substantially the same language but
 
04:05:33.349 --> 04:05:33.359 align:start position:0%
inclusive of some other language
 
04:05:35.030 --> 04:05:35.040 align:start position:0%
under the what they call the convention
 
04:05:37.349 --> 04:05:37.359 align:start position:0%
of states language
 
04:05:39.110 --> 04:05:39.120 align:start position:0%
it depends upon
 
04:05:42.309 --> 04:05:42.319 align:start position:0%
the congress but they could accept those
 
04:05:44.710 --> 04:05:44.720 align:start position:0%
as well and the convention would be
 
04:05:44.720 --> 04:05:45.990 align:start position:0%
as well and the convention would be
called

04:05:45.990 --> 04:05:46.000 align:start position:0%
called
 
04:05:49.990 --> 04:05:50.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:51.269 --> 04:05:51.279 align:start position:0%
then we're
 
04:05:52.870 --> 04:05:52.880 align:start position:0%
ready to go
 
04:05:54.710 --> 04:05:54.720 align:start position:0%
and once we're ready to go we don't have
 
04:05:56.229 --> 04:05:56.239 align:start position:0%
to wait for the other states to get
 
04:05:58.309 --> 04:05:58.319 align:start position:0%
their act together we can go down there
 
04:05:59.429 --> 04:05:59.439 align:start position:0%
and say
 
04:06:01.590 --> 04:06:01.600 align:start position:0%
we're here where are you
 
04:06:03.990 --> 04:06:04.000 align:start position:0%
and puts you know from a little bit of a
 
04:06:05.590 --> 04:06:05.600 align:start position:0%
pride position
 
04:06:08.710 --> 04:06:08.720 align:start position:0%
we can set up and say we're ready to go
 
04:06:11.510 --> 04:06:11.520 align:start position:0%
it also serves as a guide for other
 
04:06:14.150 --> 04:06:14.160 align:start position:0%
states although i believe indiana has
 
04:06:16.790 --> 04:06:16.800 align:start position:0%
this similar type of legislation already
 
04:06:18.469 --> 04:06:18.479 align:start position:0%
in place
 
04:06:20.309 --> 04:06:20.319 align:start position:0%
but what it does is it just makes it
 
04:06:20.319 --> 04:06:22.389 align:start position:0%
but what it does is it just makes it
easier

04:06:22.389 --> 04:06:22.399 align:start position:0%
easier
 
04:06:25.990 --> 04:06:26.000 align:start position:0%
and we can just go forward from here
 
04:06:27.590 --> 04:06:27.600 align:start position:0%
with it
 
04:06:28.950 --> 04:06:28.960 align:start position:0%
so that uh
 
04:06:31.510 --> 04:06:31.520 align:start position:0%
indicate that somebody's afraid of a
 
04:06:33.030 --> 04:06:33.040 align:start position:0%
runaway convention
 
04:06:35.030 --> 04:06:35.040 align:start position:0%
not in new hampshire we've got rules in
 
04:06:37.110 --> 04:06:37.120 align:start position:0%
place to say if you don't fall if you
 
04:06:39.830 --> 04:06:39.840 align:start position:0%
don't vote only on this
 
04:06:39.840 --> 04:06:41.990 align:start position:0%
don't vote only on this
material

04:06:41.990 --> 04:06:42.000 align:start position:0%
material
 
04:06:45.030 --> 04:06:45.040 align:start position:0%
come home we don't want you there
 
04:06:45.040 --> 04:06:46.469 align:start position:0%
come home we don't want you there
so

04:06:46.469 --> 04:06:46.479 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:06:47.990 --> 04:06:48.000 align:start position:0%
that's why it's there and i'll be happy
 
04:06:50.469 --> 04:06:50.479 align:start position:0%
to answer any questions regarding that
 
04:06:52.229 --> 04:06:52.239 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony i will
 
04:06:55.269 --> 04:06:55.279 align:start position:0%
check to see if there are any questions
 
04:06:59.030 --> 04:06:59.040 align:start position:0%
there is one representative roulade
 
04:07:00.469 --> 04:07:00.479 align:start position:0%
i just did that so i didn't have to ask
 
04:07:02.550 --> 04:07:02.560 align:start position:0%
my friend scott questions but i think
 
04:07:04.469 --> 04:07:04.479 align:start position:0%
you know the answers as well i'm looking
 
04:07:07.349 --> 04:07:07.359 align:start position:0%
at page one and page two of uh house
 
04:07:11.590 --> 04:07:11.600 align:start position:0%
bill 1170 specifically on page one
 
04:07:15.030 --> 04:07:15.040 align:start position:0%
lines 25 through 31
 
04:07:18.790 --> 04:07:18.800 align:start position:0%
and on page two lines one through six
 
04:07:21.590 --> 04:07:21.600 align:start position:0%
and it talks about how folks are
 
04:07:21.600 --> 04:07:22.870 align:start position:0%
and it talks about how folks are
appointed

04:07:22.870 --> 04:07:22.880 align:start position:0%
appointed
 
04:07:24.950 --> 04:07:24.960 align:start position:0%
by the new hampshire senate
 
04:07:24.960 --> 04:07:26.150 align:start position:0%
by the new hampshire senate
is

04:07:26.150 --> 04:07:26.160 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:07:28.070 --> 04:07:28.080 align:start position:0%
and the questions that i have is that is
 
04:07:29.830 --> 04:07:29.840 align:start position:0%
that appointment done
 
04:07:32.469 --> 04:07:32.479 align:start position:0%
by majority vote or by an individual in
 
04:07:33.910 --> 04:07:33.920 align:start position:0%
the senate
 
04:07:35.670 --> 04:07:35.680 align:start position:0%
i don't know
 
04:07:38.070 --> 04:07:38.080 align:start position:0%
then you probably also don't know how
 
04:07:40.870 --> 04:07:40.880 align:start position:0%
they are appointed from the house
 
04:07:43.030 --> 04:07:43.040 align:start position:0%
i know how they were appointed from the
 
04:07:44.469 --> 04:07:44.479 align:start position:0%
house in the senate in the previous
 
04:07:46.469 --> 04:07:46.479 align:start position:0%
event that's not the question i know
 
04:07:56.149 --> 04:07:56.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:59.590 --> 04:07:59.600 align:start position:0%
so the process by which we have in place
 
04:07:59.600 --> 04:08:00.710 align:start position:0%
so the process by which we have in place
here

04:08:00.710 --> 04:08:00.720 align:start position:0%
here
 
04:08:02.950 --> 04:08:02.960 align:start position:0%
at the very premise on how folks are
 
04:08:04.870 --> 04:08:04.880 align:start position:0%
appointed seems to have something that
 
04:08:06.870 --> 04:08:06.880 align:start position:0%
needs clarification
 
04:08:09.189 --> 04:08:09.199 align:start position:0%
it may very well and i would recommend
 
04:08:12.389 --> 04:08:12.399 align:start position:0%
that that be either by appointment uh
 
04:08:13.830 --> 04:08:13.840 align:start position:0%
by the speaker
 
04:08:15.670 --> 04:08:15.680 align:start position:0%
slice president
 
04:08:19.349 --> 04:08:19.359 align:start position:0%
or it would be by a majority vote of the
 
04:08:19.359 --> 04:08:24.550 align:start position:0%
or it would be by a majority vote of the
body

04:08:24.550 --> 04:08:24.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:26.229 --> 04:08:26.239 align:start position:0%
so is there somebody going to be doing
 
04:08:28.550 --> 04:08:28.560 align:start position:0%
an amendment on that section of this
 
04:08:30.950 --> 04:08:30.960 align:start position:0%
bill for us do you know
 
04:08:33.670 --> 04:08:33.680 align:start position:0%
yes i do know
 
04:08:35.750 --> 04:08:35.760 align:start position:0%
and the answer would be yes
 
04:08:37.189 --> 04:08:37.199 align:start position:0%
he would be here
 
04:08:38.870 --> 04:08:38.880 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:08:41.910 --> 04:08:41.920 align:start position:0%
thank you uh before you go um i also
 
04:08:44.469 --> 04:08:44.479 align:start position:0%
have a question is this um
 
04:08:47.910 --> 04:08:47.920 align:start position:0%
identical or substantially the same or
 
04:08:49.830 --> 04:08:49.840 align:start position:0%
do you know
 
04:08:49.840 --> 04:08:50.950 align:start position:0%
do you know
um

04:08:50.950 --> 04:08:50.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:08:54.229 --> 04:08:54.239 align:start position:0%
to house bill 148 that was passed prior
 
04:08:57.030 --> 04:08:57.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:57.040 --> 04:08:58.229 align:start position:0%
 
yes

04:08:58.229 --> 04:08:58.239 align:start position:0%
yes
 
04:08:59.910 --> 04:08:59.920 align:start position:0%
it's substantially the same it is not
 
04:09:01.990 --> 04:09:02.000 align:start position:0%
verbatim okay
 
04:09:05.189 --> 04:09:05.199 align:start position:0%
99 and 44 100 identical would you would
 
04:09:07.510 --> 04:09:07.520 align:start position:0%
you be able to provide
 
04:09:09.429 --> 04:09:09.439 align:start position:0%
the differences um
 
04:09:12.070 --> 04:09:12.080 align:start position:0%
if you're going to tell us that this
 
04:09:14.229 --> 04:09:14.239 align:start position:0%
passed in 2015
 
04:09:16.550 --> 04:09:16.560 align:start position:0%
i want to know what what past versus
 
04:09:19.429 --> 04:09:19.439 align:start position:0%
what we have in front of us now
 
04:09:21.590 --> 04:09:21.600 align:start position:0%
thank you in reviewing that it appears
 
04:09:24.149 --> 04:09:24.159 align:start position:0%
to be mostly linguistics and the
 
04:09:26.070 --> 04:09:26.080 align:start position:0%
inclusion of some
 
04:09:26.080 --> 04:09:27.750 align:start position:0%
inclusion of some
better

04:09:27.750 --> 04:09:27.760 align:start position:0%
better
 
04:09:31.910 --> 04:09:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:34.309 --> 04:09:34.319 align:start position:0%
language in its definitions the new
 
04:09:35.990 --> 04:09:36.000 align:start position:0%
hampshire is already a member of several
 
04:09:36.000 --> 04:09:37.269 align:start position:0%
hampshire is already a member of several
interstate

04:09:37.269 --> 04:09:37.279 align:start position:0%
interstate
 
04:09:37.279 --> 04:09:39.910 align:start position:0%
interstate
entities

04:09:39.910 --> 04:09:39.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:41.990 --> 04:09:42.000 align:start position:0%
and conventions including several
 
04:09:44.149 --> 04:09:44.159 align:start position:0%
compacts most notably the connecticut
 
04:09:46.469 --> 04:09:46.479 align:start position:0%
valley compact
 
04:09:48.550 --> 04:09:48.560 align:start position:0%
and the uniform law commission
 
04:09:50.469 --> 04:09:50.479 align:start position:0%
and yes that's the other one
 
04:09:52.309 --> 04:09:52.319 align:start position:0%
so my other question
 
04:09:54.229 --> 04:09:54.239 align:start position:0%
and i have to confess i heard this on a
 
04:09:56.389 --> 04:09:56.399 align:start position:0%
late night radio program one
 
04:09:58.309 --> 04:09:58.319 align:start position:0%
time going along
 
04:10:01.110 --> 04:10:01.120 align:start position:0%
did you see any no no no
 
04:10:02.870 --> 04:10:02.880 align:start position:0%
did um
 
04:10:05.429 --> 04:10:05.439 align:start position:0%
is is why
 
04:10:07.990 --> 04:10:08.000 align:start position:0%
could this be done on an ad hoc basis i
 
04:10:09.590 --> 04:10:09.600 align:start position:0%
think you almost touched on that a
 
04:10:11.750 --> 04:10:11.760 align:start position:0%
little bit and just said that you know
 
04:10:13.429 --> 04:10:13.439 align:start position:0%
we could just show up
 
04:10:13.439 --> 04:10:14.550 align:start position:0%
we could just show up
but

04:10:14.550 --> 04:10:14.560 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:10:17.750 --> 04:10:17.760 align:start position:0%
but is there any is that possible in
 
04:10:20.790 --> 04:10:20.800 align:start position:0%
your in your understanding and and is
 
04:10:20.800 --> 04:10:21.990 align:start position:0%
your in your understanding and and is
that

04:10:21.990 --> 04:10:22.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:10:25.189 --> 04:10:25.199 align:start position:0%
something that
 
04:10:28.389 --> 04:10:28.399 align:start position:0%
would be seriously considered
 
04:10:30.950 --> 04:10:30.960 align:start position:0%
when i spoke to the uh regarding the
 
04:10:33.030 --> 04:10:33.040 align:start position:0%
phoenix assembly meeting
 
04:10:33.040 --> 04:10:33.910 align:start position:0%
phoenix assembly meeting
uh

04:10:33.910 --> 04:10:33.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:10:36.309 --> 04:10:36.319 align:start position:0%
if you remember we were appointed
 
04:10:39.510 --> 04:10:39.520 align:start position:0%
by the speaker by and the senate was
 
04:10:42.149 --> 04:10:42.159 align:start position:0%
appointed by the senate upon receipt of
 
04:10:44.469 --> 04:10:44.479 align:start position:0%
a request from
 
04:10:47.910 --> 04:10:47.920 align:start position:0%
the legislature of arizona to establish
 
04:10:49.349 --> 04:10:49.359 align:start position:0%
such an event
 
04:10:52.070 --> 04:10:52.080 align:start position:0%
um the then speaker of the house in
 
04:10:54.550 --> 04:10:54.560 align:start position:0%
arizona is now a member of congress
 
04:10:54.560 --> 04:10:55.750 align:start position:0%
arizona is now a member of congress
um

04:10:55.750 --> 04:10:55.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:10:59.030 --> 04:10:59.040 align:start position:0%
but that i think when
 
04:11:01.750 --> 04:11:01.760 align:start position:0%
some 32 states responded affirmatively
 
04:11:04.870 --> 04:11:04.880 align:start position:0%
and then a hurricane hit
 
04:11:07.189 --> 04:11:07.199 align:start position:0%
for new hampshire to send delegates to
 
04:11:07.199 --> 04:11:09.030 align:start position:0%
for new hampshire to send delegates to
that

04:11:09.030 --> 04:11:09.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:11:13.429 --> 04:11:13.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:15.910 --> 04:11:15.920 align:start position:0%
it was a little sketchy there were no
 
04:11:18.389 --> 04:11:18.399 align:start position:0%
rules we were told to do the best we
 
04:11:18.399 --> 04:11:19.429 align:start position:0%
rules we were told to do the best we
could

04:11:19.429 --> 04:11:19.439 align:start position:0%
could
 
04:11:19.439 --> 04:11:20.469 align:start position:0%
could
and

04:11:20.469 --> 04:11:20.479 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:11:22.389 --> 04:11:22.399 align:start position:0%
there was no guidance as to what we
 
04:11:24.550 --> 04:11:24.560 align:start position:0%
could or couldn't do
 
04:11:24.560 --> 04:11:25.429 align:start position:0%
could or couldn't do
by

04:11:25.429 --> 04:11:25.439 align:start position:0%
by
 
04:11:27.590 --> 04:11:27.600 align:start position:0%
this legislation
 
04:11:31.030 --> 04:11:31.040 align:start position:0%
you get who's going to be appointed
 
04:11:33.429 --> 04:11:33.439 align:start position:0%
and as was pointed out by representing
 
04:11:35.349 --> 04:11:35.359 align:start position:0%
the roulard how they're going to be
 
04:11:37.110 --> 04:11:37.120 align:start position:0%
appointed thank you ma'am
 
04:11:37.120 --> 04:11:38.070 align:start position:0%
appointed thank you ma'am
uh

04:11:38.070 --> 04:11:38.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:11:41.189 --> 04:11:41.199 align:start position:0%
and what they can and cannot do and what
 
04:11:43.830 --> 04:11:43.840 align:start position:0%
happens when they screw up
 
04:11:43.840 --> 04:11:44.790 align:start position:0%
happens when they screw up
so

04:11:44.790 --> 04:11:44.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:11:46.550 --> 04:11:46.560 align:start position:0%
it just gives a little more guidance to
 
04:11:50.149 --> 04:11:50.159 align:start position:0%
whomsoever is appointed as a delegate
 
04:11:51.590 --> 04:11:51.600 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:11:51.600 --> 04:11:53.030 align:start position:0%
thank you
anyone

04:11:53.030 --> 04:11:53.040 align:start position:0%
anyone
 
04:11:53.040 --> 04:11:53.910 align:start position:0%
anyone
no

04:11:53.910 --> 04:11:53.920 align:start position:0%
no
 
04:11:56.950 --> 04:11:56.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:58.710 --> 04:11:58.720 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:12:01.590 --> 04:12:01.600 align:start position:0%
as long as we are looking at things and
 
04:12:03.670 --> 04:12:03.680 align:start position:0%
cleaning things up on page two of this
 
04:12:03.680 --> 04:12:04.550 align:start position:0%
cleaning things up on page two of this
bill

04:12:04.550 --> 04:12:04.560 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:12:06.229 --> 04:12:06.239 align:start position:0%
it talks about the expenses of the
 
04:12:09.030 --> 04:12:09.040 align:start position:0%
delegates that we send to the convention
 
04:12:11.189 --> 04:12:11.199 align:start position:0%
and we're paying them the same per diem
 
04:12:13.030 --> 04:12:13.040 align:start position:0%
rate as received by members of the
 
04:12:17.030 --> 04:12:17.040 align:start position:0%
general court what would that be
 
04:12:19.510 --> 04:12:19.520 align:start position:0%
that would be there's no per diem right
 
04:12:20.950 --> 04:12:20.960 align:start position:0%
received by the members of the general
 
04:12:23.189 --> 04:12:23.199 align:start position:0%
court there is no per diem rate right so
 
04:12:25.830 --> 04:12:25.840 align:start position:0%
that sentence then should be um taken
 
04:12:31.429 --> 04:12:31.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:33.590 --> 04:12:33.600 align:start position:0%
so how follow up
 
04:12:35.590 --> 04:12:35.600 align:start position:0%
yes so how will the delegates get paid
 
04:12:35.600 --> 04:12:37.269 align:start position:0%
yes so how will the delegates get paid
then

04:12:37.269 --> 04:12:37.279 align:start position:0%
then
 
04:12:40.469 --> 04:12:40.479 align:start position:0%
they would be uh provided room and board
 
04:12:42.149 --> 04:12:42.159 align:start position:0%
so there's going to be something like
 
04:12:44.389 --> 04:12:44.399 align:start position:0%
that follow up and an amendment that's
 
04:12:48.950 --> 04:12:48.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:51.510 --> 04:12:51.520 align:start position:0%
and one follow one more question
 
04:12:54.149 --> 04:12:54.159 align:start position:0%
if we go down to on page two and we talk
 
04:12:56.790 --> 04:12:56.800 align:start position:0%
about on line 17 it says the delegates
 
04:12:59.189 --> 04:12:59.199 align:start position:0%
from new hampshire to an interstate uh
 
04:13:01.510 --> 04:13:01.520 align:start position:0%
convention shall not have the authority
 
04:13:04.149 --> 04:13:04.159 align:start position:0%
to allow considerations for approved of
 
04:13:06.790 --> 04:13:06.800 align:start position:0%
an unauthorized amendment how is that
 
04:13:06.800 --> 04:13:08.149 align:start position:0%
an unauthorized amendment how is that
defined

04:13:08.149 --> 04:13:08.159 align:start position:0%
defined
 
04:13:09.750 --> 04:13:09.760 align:start position:0%
that would be something
 
04:13:12.630 --> 04:13:12.640 align:start position:0%
exactly as using common
 
04:13:15.670 --> 04:13:15.680 align:start position:0%
law if it's not authorized
 
04:13:17.750 --> 04:13:17.760 align:start position:0%
for their purpose of their appointment
 
04:13:19.750 --> 04:13:19.760 align:start position:0%
by their commission
 
04:13:21.910 --> 04:13:21.920 align:start position:0%
then it would be unauthorized so if
 
04:13:23.750 --> 04:13:23.760 align:start position:0%
they're appointed to a balanced budget
 
04:13:23.760 --> 04:13:25.349 align:start position:0%

they couldn't talk about
um

04:13:32.070 --> 04:13:32.080 align:start position:0%

follow up follow-up so when they're
 
04:13:40.950 --> 04:13:40.960 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
04:13:40.960 --> 04:13:42.550 align:start position:0%
talking about
um

04:13:42.550 --> 04:13:42.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:13:45.510 --> 04:13:45.520 align:start position:0%
authorized balanced budget if there is
 
04:13:48.229 --> 04:13:48.239 align:start position:0%
an amendment that's not been authorized
 
04:13:50.149 --> 04:13:50.159 align:start position:0%
by whomever it is
 
04:13:52.870 --> 04:13:52.880 align:start position:0%
um on the balanced budget would that be
 
04:13:56.950 --> 04:13:56.960 align:start position:0%
considered then an authorized amendment
 
04:13:56.960 --> 04:13:58.469 align:start position:0%
considered then an authorized amendment
what

04:13:58.469 --> 04:13:58.479 align:start position:0%
what
 
04:13:58.479 --> 04:13:59.269 align:start position:0%
what
yeah

04:13:59.269 --> 04:13:59.279 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:14:01.349 --> 04:14:01.359 align:start position:0%
okay no one can understand me i'm trying
 
04:14:04.710 --> 04:14:04.720 align:start position:0%
to hone in on what you said about if
 
04:14:07.429 --> 04:14:07.439 align:start position:0%
it's an amendment on some other subject
 
04:14:09.830 --> 04:14:09.840 align:start position:0%
if it's an amendment on the subject that
 
04:14:11.910 --> 04:14:11.920 align:start position:0%
they're voting on
 
04:14:13.510 --> 04:14:13.520 align:start position:0%
is that considered an authorized
 
04:14:17.429 --> 04:14:17.439 align:start position:0%
amendment yes if it's okay if for a case
 
04:14:19.910 --> 04:14:19.920 align:start position:0%
in point
 
04:14:21.750 --> 04:14:21.760 align:start position:0%
individuals are sent down for a balanced
 
04:14:23.990 --> 04:14:24.000 align:start position:0%
budget amendment convention
 
04:14:25.910 --> 04:14:25.920 align:start position:0%
the only topic they're going to talk
 
04:14:29.590 --> 04:14:29.600 align:start position:0%
about is a balanced budget amendment
 
04:14:32.309 --> 04:14:32.319 align:start position:0%
substantially to the language of their
 
04:14:34.309 --> 04:14:34.319 align:start position:0%
application or their petition
 
04:14:34.319 --> 04:14:35.269 align:start position:0%
application or their petition
to

04:14:35.269 --> 04:14:35.279 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:14:36.950 --> 04:14:36.960 align:start position:0%
congress for
 
04:14:39.110 --> 04:14:39.120 align:start position:0%
such a convention
 
04:14:41.189 --> 04:14:41.199 align:start position:0%
so that they're limited to that
 
04:14:41.199 --> 04:14:42.550 align:start position:0%
so that they're limited to that
information

04:14:42.550 --> 04:14:42.560 align:start position:0%
information
 
04:14:45.590 --> 04:14:45.600 align:start position:0%
okay and nothing else
 
04:14:47.110 --> 04:14:47.120 align:start position:0%
follow up and i'm assuming that that's
 
04:14:48.309 --> 04:14:48.319 align:start position:0%
going to be something that's put in the
 
04:14:49.910 --> 04:14:49.920 align:start position:0%
amendment as well so we can define that
 
04:14:51.830 --> 04:14:51.840 align:start position:0%
in some fashion that i think is already
 
04:14:53.670 --> 04:14:53.680 align:start position:0%
in there pretty well because it's well
 
04:14:55.990 --> 04:14:56.000 align:start position:0%
it's not you're not reading it but
 
04:14:58.469 --> 04:14:58.479 align:start position:0%
okay thank you i did thank you
 
04:14:58.479 --> 04:15:00.710 align:start position:0%
okay thank you i did thank you
further

04:15:00.710 --> 04:15:00.720 align:start position:0%
further
 
04:15:03.030 --> 04:15:03.040 align:start position:0%
so my quick question as a follow-up on
 
04:15:04.950 --> 04:15:04.960 align:start position:0%
that is
 
04:15:06.710 --> 04:15:06.720 align:start position:0%
at one point we heard from the prime
 
04:15:08.309 --> 04:15:08.319 align:start position:0%
sponsor saying that there was no
 
04:15:12.229 --> 04:15:12.239 align:start position:0%
restriction on a runaway quote-unquote
 
04:15:12.239 --> 04:15:14.149 align:start position:0%
restriction on a runaway quote-unquote
convention

04:15:14.149 --> 04:15:14.159 align:start position:0%
convention
 
04:15:16.630 --> 04:15:16.640 align:start position:0%
but it would seem to me
 
04:15:18.870 --> 04:15:18.880 align:start position:0%
that this would prohibit
 
04:15:21.990 --> 04:15:22.000 align:start position:0%
new hampshire from
 
04:15:25.510 --> 04:15:25.520 align:start position:0%
considering or supporting or approving
 
04:15:27.349 --> 04:15:27.359 align:start position:0%
anything that would
 
04:15:27.359 --> 04:15:28.469 align:start position:0%
anything that would
be

04:15:28.469 --> 04:15:28.479 align:start position:0%
be
 
04:15:31.110 --> 04:15:31.120 align:start position:0%
considered as a runaway is that right
 
04:15:33.349 --> 04:15:33.359 align:start position:0%
that's correct and let me go back to the
 
04:15:35.030 --> 04:15:35.040 align:start position:0%
uh original
 
04:15:37.750 --> 04:15:37.760 align:start position:0%
convention call to revise the articles
 
04:15:40.550 --> 04:15:40.560 align:start position:0%
of confederation
 
04:15:42.309 --> 04:15:42.319 align:start position:0%
new hampshire delegates were sent down
 
04:15:42.319 --> 04:15:44.149 align:start position:0%
new hampshire delegates were sent down
there

04:15:44.149 --> 04:15:44.159 align:start position:0%
there
 
04:15:45.830 --> 04:15:45.840 align:start position:0%
they got down there and realized that
 
04:15:48.630 --> 04:15:48.640 align:start position:0%
they were talking about not revising the
 
04:15:50.790 --> 04:15:50.800 align:start position:0%
articles of confederation
 
04:15:53.269 --> 04:15:53.279 align:start position:0%
but establishing an entirely new system
 
04:15:56.550 --> 04:15:56.560 align:start position:0%
of government they came home
 
04:15:58.389 --> 04:15:58.399 align:start position:0%
then they went back down with the
 
04:16:01.590 --> 04:16:01.600 align:start position:0%
approval of the legislature
 
04:16:03.110 --> 04:16:03.120 align:start position:0%
full authority
 
04:16:06.710 --> 04:16:06.720 align:start position:0%
to do whatever was necessary to create
 
04:16:08.550 --> 04:16:08.560 align:start position:0%
a new form of government because the
 
04:16:10.870 --> 04:16:10.880 align:start position:0%
article you know it was just that a new
 
04:16:14.550 --> 04:16:14.560 align:start position:0%
president every six months that he's
 
04:16:16.229 --> 04:16:16.239 align:start position:0%
you know if you know your history you
 
04:16:17.910 --> 04:16:17.920 align:start position:0%
know it worked about as well as dropping
 
04:16:19.830 --> 04:16:19.840 align:start position:0%
a rock and water and hoping that it
 
04:16:21.110 --> 04:16:21.120 align:start position:0%
would float
 
04:16:21.120 --> 04:16:22.790 align:start position:0%
would float
um

04:16:22.790 --> 04:16:22.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:16:25.429 --> 04:16:25.439 align:start position:0%
you know so that's
 
04:16:25.439 --> 04:16:26.389 align:start position:0%
you know so that's
okay

04:16:26.389 --> 04:16:26.399 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:16:29.590 --> 04:16:29.600 align:start position:0%

i'm here to introduce hb 1269
 
04:21:12.790 --> 04:21:12.800 align:start position:0%
a bill that would

repeal or amend certain
 
04:21:20.149 --> 04:21:20.159 align:start position:0%
statutory commissions and also
 
04:21:22.870 --> 04:21:22.880 align:start position:0%
include the creation of a review
 
04:21:25.429 --> 04:21:25.439 align:start position:0%
committee and many other things that i
 
04:21:27.670 --> 04:21:27.680 align:start position:0%
will describe
 
04:21:27.680 --> 04:21:28.870 align:start position:0%
will describe
so

04:21:28.870 --> 04:21:28.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:21:31.990 --> 04:21:32.000 align:start position:0%
as you know since you've heard this tale
 
04:21:34.389 --> 04:21:34.399 align:start position:0%
several times
 
04:21:37.349 --> 04:21:37.359 align:start position:0%
when i first became deputy speaker i was
 
04:21:39.349 --> 04:21:39.359 align:start position:0%
pretty shocked to find out that
 
04:21:41.990 --> 04:21:42.000 align:start position:0%
approximately 300 appointments had to be
 
04:21:45.670 --> 04:21:45.680 align:start position:0%
made to approximately 240
 
04:21:48.870 --> 04:21:48.880 align:start position:0%
statutory commissions in fairly short
 
04:21:52.149 --> 04:21:52.159 align:start position:0%
order and it was quite amazing to me
 
04:21:55.030 --> 04:21:55.040 align:start position:0%
that we had as many commissions as we
 
04:21:55.040 --> 04:21:56.550 align:start position:0%
that we had as many commissions as we
did

04:21:56.550 --> 04:21:56.560 align:start position:0%
did
 
04:22:00.630 --> 04:22:00.640 align:start position:0%
it had been 10 years since neil kirk and
 
04:22:03.510 --> 04:22:03.520 align:start position:0%
lori harding had done a complete review
 
04:22:05.429 --> 04:22:05.439 align:start position:0%
of all the existing statutory
 
04:22:05.439 --> 04:22:06.630 align:start position:0%
of all the existing statutory
commissions

04:22:06.630 --> 04:22:06.640 align:start position:0%
commissions
 
04:22:08.950 --> 04:22:08.960 align:start position:0%
and we determined at that time that it
 
04:22:11.110 --> 04:22:11.120 align:start position:0%
was high time to do another review of
 
04:22:11.120 --> 04:22:11.990 align:start position:0%
was high time to do another review of
them

04:22:11.990 --> 04:22:12.000 align:start position:0%
them
 
04:22:13.830 --> 04:22:13.840 align:start position:0%
so what we did
 
04:22:16.950 --> 04:22:16.960 align:start position:0%
over the course of two years we did a
 
04:22:19.189 --> 04:22:19.199 align:start position:0%
complete um
 
04:22:21.269 --> 04:22:21.279 align:start position:0%
cataloging of all the existing
 
04:22:23.990 --> 04:22:24.000 align:start position:0%
commissions we figured out and i worked
 
04:22:26.309 --> 04:22:26.319 align:start position:0%
with pam smarling of house committee
 
04:22:28.870 --> 04:22:28.880 align:start position:0%
services she looked at you know when
 
04:22:31.349 --> 04:22:31.359 align:start position:0%
they had met and all that sort of thing
 
04:22:34.229 --> 04:22:34.239 align:start position:0%
and then we created a procedure where
 
04:22:38.469 --> 04:22:38.479 align:start position:0%
we reviewed every single commission um
 
04:22:39.750 --> 04:22:39.760 align:start position:0%
with the
 
04:22:42.389 --> 04:22:42.399 align:start position:0%
age the administrative agency that it
 
04:22:46.070 --> 04:22:46.080 align:start position:0%
was attached to to assess its further
 
04:22:46.080 --> 04:22:47.349 align:start position:0%
was attached to to assess its further
usefulness

04:22:47.349 --> 04:22:47.359 align:start position:0%
usefulness
 
04:22:49.269 --> 04:22:49.279 align:start position:0%
the other thing we did is we went
 
04:22:52.149 --> 04:22:52.159 align:start position:0%
through every single
 
04:22:54.469 --> 04:22:54.479 align:start position:0%
executive order from the governor and
 
04:22:55.990 --> 04:22:56.000 align:start position:0%
looked at every commission that was
 
04:22:59.110 --> 04:22:59.120 align:start position:0%
created pursuant to those orders and we
 
04:23:01.830 --> 04:23:01.840 align:start position:0%
made recommendations on that basis and
 
04:23:04.870 --> 04:23:04.880 align:start position:0%
that resulted in a series of
 
04:23:06.229 --> 04:23:06.239 align:start position:0%
bills to
 
04:23:08.550 --> 04:23:08.560 align:start position:0%
basically embody the bipartisan
 
04:23:10.790 --> 04:23:10.800 align:start position:0%
recommendation of the
 
04:23:13.269 --> 04:23:13.279 align:start position:0%
committee on committees
 
04:23:15.030 --> 04:23:15.040 align:start position:0%
so what you have
 
04:23:20.950 --> 04:23:20.960 align:start position:0%
here today is hb 1269 hb 1269
 
04:23:20.960 --> 04:23:22.389 align:start position:0%
here today is hb 1269 hb 1269
is

04:23:22.389 --> 04:23:22.399 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:23:24.149 --> 04:23:24.159 align:start position:0%
important in part
 
04:23:27.429 --> 04:23:27.439 align:start position:0%
identical to the bill that you folks saw
 
04:23:31.750 --> 04:23:31.760 align:start position:0%
and passed through um hb 186
 
04:23:33.349 --> 04:23:33.359 align:start position:0%
last term
 
04:23:34.790 --> 04:23:34.800 align:start position:0%
and as you know it failed in the
 
04:23:37.429 --> 04:23:37.439 align:start position:0%
committee of conference so i'm i'm back
 
04:23:40.630 --> 04:23:40.640 align:start position:0%
here and that and so you see the first
 
04:23:42.870 --> 04:23:42.880 align:start position:0%
part of the of the bill does have the
 
04:23:46.710 --> 04:23:46.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:49.910 --> 04:23:49.920 align:start position:0%
i had been in conversations with speaker
 
04:23:52.149 --> 04:23:52.159 align:start position:0%
packard's office who had similar
 
04:23:52.159 --> 04:23:53.750 align:start position:0%
packard's office who had similar
concerns

04:23:53.750 --> 04:23:53.760 align:start position:0%
concerns
 
04:23:55.830 --> 04:23:55.840 align:start position:0%
to speaker shirtless about the
 
04:23:58.389 --> 04:23:58.399 align:start position:0%
proliferation of these commissions and
 
04:24:01.189 --> 04:24:01.199 align:start position:0%
he really wanted to
 
04:24:01.199 --> 04:24:02.309 align:start position:0%
he really wanted to
work

04:24:02.309 --> 04:24:02.319 align:start position:0%
work
 
04:24:02.319 --> 04:24:03.349 align:start position:0%
work
toward

04:24:03.349 --> 04:24:03.359 align:start position:0%
toward
 
04:24:05.750 --> 04:24:05.760 align:start position:0%
putting some procedures into place to
 
04:24:09.189 --> 04:24:09.199 align:start position:0%
see if we couldn't winnow them and also
 
04:24:11.910 --> 04:24:11.920 align:start position:0%
put in sort of a re routine review
 
04:24:11.920 --> 04:24:13.189 align:start position:0%
put in sort of a re routine review
process

04:24:13.189 --> 04:24:13.199 align:start position:0%
process
 
04:24:16.149 --> 04:24:16.159 align:start position:0%
and representative um umberger was also
 
04:24:19.349 --> 04:24:19.359 align:start position:0%
tasked by the speaker to work with me in
 
04:24:23.349 --> 04:24:23.359 align:start position:0%
development of um some of these concepts
 
04:24:23.359 --> 04:24:24.870 align:start position:0%
development of um some of these concepts
so

04:24:24.870 --> 04:24:24.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:24:24.880 --> 04:24:25.830 align:start position:0%
so
um

04:24:25.830 --> 04:24:25.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:24:29.390 --> 04:24:29.400 align:start position:0%
just jumping ahead to that section of it
 
04:24:29.400 --> 04:24:30.550 align:start position:0%
just jumping ahead to that section of it
[Music]

04:24:30.550 --> 04:24:30.560 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:24:33.189 --> 04:24:33.199 align:start position:0%
the other thing in working with house
 
04:24:35.590 --> 04:24:35.600 align:start position:0%
counsel jim cianci
 
04:24:38.630 --> 04:24:38.640 align:start position:0%
we realized that there really wasn't a
 
04:24:42.550 --> 04:24:42.560 align:start position:0%
distinction in statute made between
 
04:24:44.630 --> 04:24:44.640 align:start position:0%
legislative study committees that are
 
04:24:44.640 --> 04:24:46.070 align:start position:0%
legislative study committees that are
only

04:24:46.070 --> 04:24:46.080 align:start position:0%
only
 
04:24:48.950 --> 04:24:48.960 align:start position:0%
members of the legislature and those are
 
04:24:53.429 --> 04:24:53.439 align:start position:0%
set forth in chapter law and codified
 
04:24:55.910 --> 04:24:55.920 align:start position:0%
statutory committees which is what we
 
04:24:59.269 --> 04:24:59.279 align:start position:0%
around here call them which includes not
 
04:24:59.279 --> 04:25:00.469 align:start position:0%
around here call them which includes not
only

04:25:00.469 --> 04:25:00.479 align:start position:0%
only
 
04:25:03.189 --> 04:25:03.199 align:start position:0%
legislative members but members of the
 
04:25:05.269 --> 04:25:05.279 align:start position:0%
public lobby you know lobbyists
 
04:25:06.710 --> 04:25:06.720 align:start position:0%
representatives of different
 
04:25:06.720 --> 04:25:08.149 align:start position:0%
representatives of different
organizations

04:25:08.149 --> 04:25:08.159 align:start position:0%
organizations
 
04:25:10.469 --> 04:25:10.479 align:start position:0%
so what we tried to do here
 
04:25:13.110 --> 04:25:13.120 align:start position:0%
is very clearly distinguished between
 
04:25:14.630 --> 04:25:14.640 align:start position:0%
the two of them
 
04:25:18.070 --> 04:25:18.080 align:start position:0%
now um when i mentioned originally about
 
04:25:20.550 --> 04:25:20.560 align:start position:0%
having to make 300 appointments to
 
04:25:23.429 --> 04:25:23.439 align:start position:0%
approximately 240 statutory commission
 
04:25:25.830 --> 04:25:25.840 align:start position:0%
they are statutory commissions those
 
04:25:29.030 --> 04:25:29.040 align:start position:0%
aren't the member only chapter law
 
04:25:29.040 --> 04:25:30.630 align:start position:0%
aren't the member only chapter law
committees

04:25:30.630 --> 04:25:30.640 align:start position:0%
committees
 
04:25:30.640 --> 04:25:31.349 align:start position:0%
committees
so

04:25:31.349 --> 04:25:31.359 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:25:33.349 --> 04:25:33.359 align:start position:0%
um one of the recommendations of the
 
04:25:36.550 --> 04:25:36.560 align:start position:0%
committee on committees was that
 
04:25:38.870 --> 04:25:38.880 align:start position:0%
there be a routine review of these
 
04:25:40.630 --> 04:25:40.640 align:start position:0%
commissions so you didn't wake up one
 
04:25:43.269 --> 04:25:43.279 align:start position:0%
day after 10 years and realize that you
 
04:25:45.510 --> 04:25:45.520 align:start position:0%
know the roof was caving in because we
 
04:25:47.590 --> 04:25:47.600 align:start position:0%
had so many and working with
 
04:25:49.590 --> 04:25:49.600 align:start position:0%
representative umberger who had
 
04:25:51.830 --> 04:25:51.840 align:start position:0%
experience on the joint committee on
 
04:25:53.510 --> 04:25:53.520 align:start position:0%
dedicated funds
 
04:25:55.030 --> 04:25:55.040 align:start position:0%
we put together
 
04:25:58.630 --> 04:25:58.640 align:start position:0%
a committee that would review
 
04:26:01.510 --> 04:26:01.520 align:start position:0%
the existing statutory committees on a
 
04:26:03.590 --> 04:26:03.600 align:start position:0%
revolving basis
 
04:26:03.600 --> 04:26:04.389 align:start position:0%
revolving basis
and

04:26:04.389 --> 04:26:04.399 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:26:04.399 --> 04:26:05.750 align:start position:0%
and
and

04:26:05.750 --> 04:26:05.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:26:06.950 --> 04:26:06.960 align:start position:0%
i feel
 
04:26:09.110 --> 04:26:09.120 align:start position:0%
that by putting this sort i mean i've
 
04:26:10.950 --> 04:26:10.960 align:start position:0%
talked to some people they they think
 
04:26:13.030 --> 04:26:13.040 align:start position:0%
it's sort of counterintuitive to create
 
04:26:16.070 --> 04:26:16.080 align:start position:0%
a committee to review committees but i
 
04:26:18.630 --> 04:26:18.640 align:start position:0%
sincerely believe that unless we have
 
04:26:21.510 --> 04:26:21.520 align:start position:0%
some sort of routine in place to review
 
04:26:23.990 --> 04:26:24.000 align:start position:0%
these things way goes on to way
 
04:26:25.670 --> 04:26:25.680 align:start position:0%
and they will just continue to
 
04:26:25.680 --> 04:26:27.030 align:start position:0%
and they will just continue to
proliferate

04:26:27.030 --> 04:26:27.040 align:start position:0%
proliferate
 
04:26:28.790 --> 04:26:28.800 align:start position:0%
in fact i was driving down here this
 
04:26:30.309 --> 04:26:30.319 align:start position:0%
morning and i was thinking okay this is
 
04:26:33.110 --> 04:26:33.120 align:start position:0%
like a lawn and if you ignore it you
 
04:26:34.870 --> 04:26:34.880 align:start position:0%
know the grass just keeps growing and
 
04:26:36.550 --> 04:26:36.560 align:start position:0%
growing and growing and pretty soon you
 
04:26:37.429 --> 04:26:37.439 align:start position:0%
have a
 
04:26:39.510 --> 04:26:39.520 align:start position:0%
forest and then it's really a whole lot
 
04:26:42.149 --> 04:26:42.159 align:start position:0%
of work to cut it back down to uh lawn
 
04:26:44.229 --> 04:26:44.239 align:start position:0%
again so i think we really have to work
 
04:26:47.990 --> 04:26:48.000 align:start position:0%
on that the other thing that um
 
04:26:50.870 --> 04:26:50.880 align:start position:0%
that was recommended by our committee on
 
04:26:53.269 --> 04:26:53.279 align:start position:0%
committees was that you build in a
 
04:26:56.149 --> 04:26:56.159 align:start position:0%
repeal date by law for every single
 
04:26:58.870 --> 04:26:58.880 align:start position:0%
statutory commission that is passed and
 
04:27:01.910 --> 04:27:01.920 align:start position:0%
what we have in here is five years so
 
04:27:03.910 --> 04:27:03.920 align:start position:0%
that it will be clear that these things
 
04:27:07.510 --> 04:27:07.520 align:start position:0%
have to repeal at a minimum
 
04:27:10.550 --> 04:27:10.560 align:start position:0%
or at a maximum after five years and if
 
04:27:12.309 --> 04:27:12.319 align:start position:0%
they want to continue then somebody's
 
04:27:14.790 --> 04:27:14.800 align:start position:0%
got to introduce a bill to have them
 
04:27:17.670 --> 04:27:17.680 align:start position:0%
continue and then the other thing that
 
04:27:19.590 --> 04:27:19.600 align:start position:0%
we all really felt strongly about is
 
04:27:21.189 --> 04:27:21.199 align:start position:0%
that you had to cap the number of
 
04:27:22.870 --> 04:27:22.880 align:start position:0%
members because some of these things can
 
04:27:26.070 --> 04:27:26.080 align:start position:0%
have 20 30 40 members and it creates an
 
04:27:27.910 --> 04:27:27.920 align:start position:0%
unbelievable burden on the
 
04:27:27.920 --> 04:27:29.590 align:start position:0%
unbelievable burden on the
administrative

04:27:29.590 --> 04:27:29.600 align:start position:0%
administrative
 
04:27:31.590 --> 04:27:31.600 align:start position:0%
and legislative staff
 
04:27:32.790 --> 04:27:32.800 align:start position:0%
to try to
 
04:27:35.030 --> 04:27:35.040 align:start position:0%
manage that sort of thing so we capped
 
04:27:37.670 --> 04:27:37.680 align:start position:0%
it at 15.
 
04:27:40.790 --> 04:27:40.800 align:start position:0%
the other thing that we did in here is
 
04:27:43.429 --> 04:27:43.439 align:start position:0%
we put in in the law
 
04:27:47.189 --> 04:27:47.199 align:start position:0%
that the reports from these statutory
 
04:27:49.830 --> 04:27:49.840 align:start position:0%
commissions which we're calling codified
 
04:27:52.870 --> 04:27:52.880 align:start position:0%
study committees in here have to be sent
 
04:27:54.790 --> 04:27:54.800 align:start position:0%
to the standing committees with the
 
04:27:57.990 --> 04:27:58.000 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction over the subject matter
 
04:28:00.149 --> 04:28:00.159 align:start position:0%
that the study committees have because
 
04:28:03.429 --> 04:28:03.439 align:start position:0%
the other thing that i found is that
 
04:28:05.349 --> 04:28:05.359 align:start position:0%
although it was nice that all these
 
04:28:07.830 --> 04:28:07.840 align:start position:0%
reports were going to the clerk and to
 
04:28:09.510 --> 04:28:09.520 align:start position:0%
the senate president and the house
 
04:28:12.070 --> 04:28:12.080 align:start position:0%
speaker in many cases they weren't going
 
04:28:15.349 --> 04:28:15.359 align:start position:0%
to the committees that really should be
 
04:28:17.429 --> 04:28:17.439 align:start position:0%
up to speed on what these things were
 
04:28:17.439 --> 04:28:18.790 align:start position:0%
up to speed on what these things were
studying

04:28:18.790 --> 04:28:18.800 align:start position:0%
studying
 
04:28:20.950 --> 04:28:20.960 align:start position:0%
so we have that in there and we also
 
04:28:22.550 --> 04:28:22.560 align:start position:0%
have in here that
 
04:28:24.469 --> 04:28:24.479 align:start position:0%
we want to make sure that the study
 
04:28:24.479 --> 04:28:25.510 align:start position:0%
we want to make sure that the study
committee

04:28:25.510 --> 04:28:25.520 align:start position:0%
committee
 
04:28:28.389 --> 04:28:28.399 align:start position:0%
the codified study committee reports go
 
04:28:30.950 --> 04:28:30.960 align:start position:0%
on the general court website so they're
 
04:28:35.349 --> 04:28:35.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:38.710 --> 04:28:38.720 align:start position:0%
and i think that's just about it uh
 
04:28:41.670 --> 04:28:41.680 align:start position:0%
and i'd be happy to take any questions
 
04:28:43.269 --> 04:28:43.279 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you for your
 
04:28:45.189 --> 04:28:45.199 align:start position:0%
testimony um
 
04:28:51.429 --> 04:28:51.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:53.590 --> 04:28:53.600 align:start position:0%
um i have one okay
 
04:28:56.790 --> 04:28:56.800 align:start position:0%
just to warm it up um my
 
04:29:00.550 --> 04:29:00.560 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm reading your testimony and um in
 
04:29:02.389 --> 04:29:02.399 align:start position:0%
the last four
 
04:29:04.710 --> 04:29:04.720 align:start position:0%
words on the first page were
 
04:29:06.630 --> 04:29:06.640 align:start position:0%
but with some additions
 
04:29:08.870 --> 04:29:08.880 align:start position:0%
um i'm wondering
 
04:29:10.389 --> 04:29:10.399 align:start position:0%
if you can
 
04:29:12.870 --> 04:29:12.880 align:start position:0%
quickly in
 
04:29:14.309 --> 04:29:14.319 align:start position:0%
tell me
 
04:29:16.550 --> 04:29:16.560 align:start position:0%
everything that you've just testified is
 
04:29:19.830 --> 04:29:19.840 align:start position:0%
that considered those some additions yes
 
04:29:21.349 --> 04:29:21.359 align:start position:0%
sorry if that was unclear in the
 
04:29:23.349 --> 04:29:23.359 align:start position:0%
testimony no i'm just clarifying yeah
 
04:29:24.630 --> 04:29:24.640 align:start position:0%
that's it
 
04:29:26.950 --> 04:29:26.960 align:start position:0%
so um
 
04:29:29.750 --> 04:29:29.760 align:start position:0%
you've added these features that you've
 
04:29:31.189 --> 04:29:31.199 align:start position:0%
talked about
 
04:29:33.349 --> 04:29:33.359 align:start position:0%
for which we've taken notes
 
04:29:33.359 --> 04:29:34.309 align:start position:0%
for which we've taken notes
um

04:29:34.309 --> 04:29:34.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:29:37.590 --> 04:29:37.600 align:start position:0%
under the the
 
04:29:39.510 --> 04:29:39.520 align:start position:0%
under the old
 
04:29:39.520 --> 04:29:40.550 align:start position:0%
under the old
um

04:29:40.550 --> 04:29:40.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:29:43.429 --> 04:29:43.439 align:start position:0%
statute i guess for that that created
 
04:29:45.269 --> 04:29:45.279 align:start position:0%
your organization right
 
04:29:49.110 --> 04:29:49.120 align:start position:0%
so how does your organization go away
 
04:29:51.830 --> 04:29:51.840 align:start position:0%
it's gone it doesn't exist anymore so
 
04:29:54.149 --> 04:29:54.159 align:start position:0%
november was the last
 
04:29:56.389 --> 04:29:56.399 align:start position:0%
filing right the final filing that's
 
04:29:58.550 --> 04:29:58.560 align:start position:0%
correct okay it was automatically
 
04:29:58.560 --> 04:29:59.670 align:start position:0%
correct okay it was automatically
repealed

04:29:59.670 --> 04:29:59.680 align:start position:0%
repealed
 
04:29:59.680 --> 04:30:00.630 align:start position:0%
repealed
okay

04:30:00.630 --> 04:30:00.640 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:30:00.640 --> 04:30:01.590 align:start position:0%
okay
um

04:30:01.590 --> 04:30:01.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:30:03.910 --> 04:30:03.920 align:start position:0%
we had some
 
04:30:06.469 --> 04:30:06.479 align:start position:0%
concern and i and it may be that
 
04:30:08.469 --> 04:30:08.479 align:start position:0%
representative umberger can explain it
 
04:30:09.750 --> 04:30:09.760 align:start position:0%
to us
 
04:30:12.389 --> 04:30:12.399 align:start position:0%
from a prior bill that we had today that
 
04:30:12.399 --> 04:30:13.429 align:start position:0%
from a prior bill that we had today that
had

04:30:13.429 --> 04:30:13.439 align:start position:0%
had
 
04:30:14.950 --> 04:30:14.960 align:start position:0%
two or three
 
04:30:17.990 --> 04:30:18.000 align:start position:0%
extra repeals added to it
 
04:30:20.710 --> 04:30:20.720 align:start position:0%
that comes from this bill i believe
 
04:30:23.189 --> 04:30:23.199 align:start position:0%
i i'm i'm not sure i'm aware of that
 
04:30:25.590 --> 04:30:25.600 align:start position:0%
bill and and thank i i thank
 
04:30:27.590 --> 04:30:27.600 align:start position:0%
representative umberger for making me
 
04:30:29.510 --> 04:30:29.520 align:start position:0%
aware of it
 
04:30:31.590 --> 04:30:31.600 align:start position:0%
i think it was the bill that was
 
04:30:34.309 --> 04:30:34.319 align:start position:0%
introduced by representative weiler
 
04:30:35.750 --> 04:30:35.760 align:start position:0%
there were three
 
04:30:37.750 --> 04:30:37.760 align:start position:0%
commissions on there were three things
 
04:30:39.830 --> 04:30:39.840 align:start position:0%
on there i double checked them two of
 
04:30:41.670 --> 04:30:41.680 align:start position:0%
them are in my bill
 
04:30:45.189 --> 04:30:45.199 align:start position:0%
but one of them i think um
 
04:30:47.670 --> 04:30:47.680 align:start position:0%
and and she can talk more to this but i
 
04:30:50.309 --> 04:30:50.319 align:start position:0%
think one of them um you know time
 
04:30:52.630 --> 04:30:52.640 align:start position:0%
marches on we did our review a year and
 
04:30:55.429 --> 04:30:55.439 align:start position:0%
a half or so ago this one apparently has
 
04:30:57.510 --> 04:30:57.520 align:start position:0%
also been recommended for repeal that's
 
04:30:59.990 --> 04:31:00.000 align:start position:0%
in that other i mean at the time we
 
04:31:01.750 --> 04:31:01.760 align:start position:0%
didn't but that doesn't mean it isn't
 
04:31:04.070 --> 04:31:04.080 align:start position:0%
deserving to be repealed
 
04:31:04.080 --> 04:31:05.030 align:start position:0%
deserving to be repealed
um

04:31:05.030 --> 04:31:05.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:31:08.149 --> 04:31:08.159 align:start position:0%
thank you for your response i i also
 
04:31:11.349 --> 04:31:11.359 align:start position:0%
recall and i had in my notes from the
 
04:31:13.990 --> 04:31:14.000 align:start position:0%
prior years that we looked at this
 
04:31:16.630 --> 04:31:16.640 align:start position:0%
that there were issues with weights and
 
04:31:20.149 --> 04:31:20.159 align:start position:0%
measures that we dealt with um or and
 
04:31:22.309 --> 04:31:22.319 align:start position:0%
i'm and i'm not sure
 
04:31:25.349 --> 04:31:25.359 align:start position:0%
the disposition of that problem and we
 
04:31:29.189 --> 04:31:29.199 align:start position:0%
also had an issue with um
 
04:31:32.950 --> 04:31:32.960 align:start position:0%
a membership of a seacoast organization
 
04:31:36.309 --> 04:31:36.319 align:start position:0%
so what i what i did uh representative
 
04:31:40.070 --> 04:31:40.080 align:start position:0%
hill is that i went ahead and i used for
 
04:31:43.110 --> 04:31:43.120 align:start position:0%
this bill the version of the bill as it
 
04:31:45.510 --> 04:31:45.520 align:start position:0%
was passed in the senate
 
04:31:48.149 --> 04:31:48.159 align:start position:0%
and the senate actually removed the
 
04:31:48.159 --> 04:31:49.189 align:start position:0%
and the senate actually removed the
section

04:31:49.189 --> 04:31:49.199 align:start position:0%
section
 
04:31:51.750 --> 04:31:51.760 align:start position:0%
on fish and game for the reasons that we
 
04:31:53.670 --> 04:31:53.680 align:start position:0%
discussed during our you know the
 
04:31:57.030 --> 04:31:57.040 align:start position:0%
hearing when i was here before um
 
04:31:57.040 --> 04:31:58.469 align:start position:0%
hearing when i was here before um
uh

04:31:58.469 --> 04:31:58.479 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:32:01.189 --> 04:32:01.199 align:start position:0%
they got testimony and they decided at
 
04:32:03.510 --> 04:32:03.520 align:start position:0%
that point that it was advisable to
 
04:32:05.990 --> 04:32:06.000 align:start position:0%
remove it from from our version of the
 
04:32:09.269 --> 04:32:09.279 align:start position:0%
bill and then um the other thing was
 
04:32:11.269 --> 04:32:11.279 align:start position:0%
that i remember um
 
04:32:14.229 --> 04:32:14.239 align:start position:0%
commissioner uh jasper had communicated
 
04:32:16.229 --> 04:32:16.239 align:start position:0%
that he wanted to get rid of the weights
 
04:32:18.710 --> 04:32:18.720 align:start position:0%
and measures and they included that in
 
04:32:21.030 --> 04:32:21.040 align:start position:0%
the senate version of the bill
 
04:32:23.990 --> 04:32:24.000 align:start position:0%
okay so that part was taken care of yeah
 
04:32:25.990 --> 04:32:26.000 align:start position:0%
the last part that i recall was
 
04:32:28.309 --> 04:32:28.319 align:start position:0%
something through the department of
 
04:32:28.319 --> 04:32:30.309 align:start position:0%
something through the department of
insurance

04:32:30.309 --> 04:32:30.319 align:start position:0%
insurance
 
04:32:32.229 --> 04:32:32.239 align:start position:0%
that they had a
 
04:32:32.239 --> 04:32:33.510 align:start position:0%
that they had a
um

04:32:33.510 --> 04:32:33.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:32:34.870 --> 04:32:34.880 align:start position:0%
a repeal
 
04:32:38.149 --> 04:32:38.159 align:start position:0%
or they no they um
 
04:32:40.389 --> 04:32:40.399 align:start position:0%
objected to something that was being
 
04:32:42.630 --> 04:32:42.640 align:start position:0%
repealed they thought was
 
04:32:45.269 --> 04:32:45.279 align:start position:0%
incorrect does that i'm i'm not
 
04:32:48.550 --> 04:32:48.560 align:start position:0%
remembering that but all the arguments
 
04:32:50.630 --> 04:32:50.640 align:start position:0%
that um
 
04:32:52.790 --> 04:32:52.800 align:start position:0%
that were made i
 
04:32:55.189 --> 04:32:55.199 align:start position:0%
sent senator carson and her committee
 
04:32:57.750 --> 04:32:57.760 align:start position:0%
basically took care of and that's why i
 
04:33:00.389 --> 04:33:00.399 align:start position:0%
thought it made a lot of sense to just
 
04:33:02.389 --> 04:33:02.399 align:start position:0%
start with the bill the way it was
 
04:33:04.709 --> 04:33:04.719 align:start position:0%
passed by the senate and use that as our
 
04:33:04.719 --> 04:33:07.269 align:start position:0%
passed by the senate and use that as our
model

04:33:07.269 --> 04:33:07.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:07.279 --> 04:33:09.910 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:33:09.910 --> 04:33:09.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:12.949 --> 04:33:12.959 align:start position:0%
i'm done anyone
 
04:33:12.959 --> 04:33:20.070 align:start position:0%
i'm done anyone
no

04:33:20.070 --> 04:33:20.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:22.070 --> 04:33:22.080 align:start position:0%
thanks for coming i it's not that i have
 
04:33:23.750 --> 04:33:23.760 align:start position:0%
an additional question it's really to
 
04:33:25.189 --> 04:33:25.199 align:start position:0%
kind of
 
04:33:27.429 --> 04:33:27.439 align:start position:0%
have my notes that i have i think from
 
04:33:29.510 --> 04:33:29.520 align:start position:0%
the last hearing we had as well
 
04:33:32.789 --> 04:33:32.799 align:start position:0%
and i think that there was
 
04:33:36.629 --> 04:33:36.639 align:start position:0%
something to do with insurance oversight
 
04:33:36.639 --> 04:33:37.910 align:start position:0%
something to do with insurance oversight
and

04:33:37.910 --> 04:33:37.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:33:39.990 --> 04:33:40.000 align:start position:0%
that was in there ten years ago
 
04:33:41.189 --> 04:33:41.199 align:start position:0%
i think that must be what you were
 
04:33:42.551 --> 04:33:42.561 align:start position:0%
talking about with the insurance
 
04:33:42.561 --> 04:33:43.750 align:start position:0%
talking about with the insurance
department

04:33:43.750 --> 04:33:43.760 align:start position:0%
department
 
04:33:45.750 --> 04:33:45.760 align:start position:0%
and there was also some joint health
 
04:33:45.760 --> 04:33:46.869 align:start position:0%
and there was also some joint health
care

04:33:46.869 --> 04:33:46.879 align:start position:0%
care
 
04:33:49.590 --> 04:33:49.600 align:start position:0%
issues that were repealed as well so
 
04:33:51.590 --> 04:33:51.600 align:start position:0%
that's no longer in this bill that we
 
04:33:53.670 --> 04:33:53.680 align:start position:0%
have in front of us
 
04:33:55.750 --> 04:33:55.760 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i just i don't i'm not
 
04:33:57.750 --> 04:33:57.760 align:start position:0%
remembering the department of insurance
 
04:34:00.949 --> 04:34:00.959 align:start position:0%
section though the one that's in here
 
04:34:03.109 --> 04:34:03.119 align:start position:0%
is the um
 
04:34:06.709 --> 04:34:06.719 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:09.029 --> 04:34:09.039 align:start position:0%
of the one that had to do with uh
 
04:34:11.910 --> 04:34:11.920 align:start position:0%
medicaid implementation in in new
 
04:34:14.070 --> 04:34:14.080 align:start position:0%
hampshire and
 
04:34:17.269 --> 04:34:17.279 align:start position:0%
the the role of that commission
 
04:34:20.869 --> 04:34:20.879 align:start position:0%
elapsed and nobody had any uh thought
 
04:34:23.349 --> 04:34:23.359 align:start position:0%
that that needed to continue so what the
 
04:34:26.629 --> 04:34:26.639 align:start position:0%
bill has is its repeal and a lot of the
 
04:34:30.150 --> 04:34:30.160 align:start position:0%
verbiage that you see in here is ols did
 
04:34:32.470 --> 04:34:32.480 align:start position:0%
a really good job they had to go back
 
04:34:34.949 --> 04:34:34.959 align:start position:0%
through existing statutes and just cross
 
04:34:37.510 --> 04:34:37.520 align:start position:0%
out any references to a lot of these
 
04:34:39.269 --> 04:34:39.279 align:start position:0%
commissions because
 
04:34:41.269 --> 04:34:41.279 align:start position:0%
they weave their way in all over the
 
04:34:43.269 --> 04:34:43.279 align:start position:0%
place so i know that there's some
 
04:34:45.590 --> 04:34:45.600 align:start position:0%
language in here where that was removed
 
04:34:48.869 --> 04:34:48.879 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:48.879 --> 04:34:49.750 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:34:49.750 --> 04:34:49.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:34:52.230 --> 04:34:52.240 align:start position:0%
there was also a section on the
 
04:34:54.470 --> 04:34:54.480 align:start position:0%
legislative youth advisory council did
 
04:34:54.480 --> 04:34:56.310 align:start position:0%
legislative youth advisory council did
that

04:34:56.310 --> 04:34:56.320 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:34:58.310 --> 04:34:58.320 align:start position:0%
i had spoken with representative
 
04:35:00.230 --> 04:35:00.240 align:start position:0%
umberger about that we spoke to
 
04:35:02.390 --> 04:35:02.400 align:start position:0%
representative walls i think she spoke
 
04:35:04.390 --> 04:35:04.400 align:start position:0%
to representative edwards there was just
 
04:35:07.269 --> 04:35:07.279 align:start position:0%
some language that just didn't make
 
04:35:09.349 --> 04:35:09.359 align:start position:0%
sense with the way things are currently
 
04:35:11.670 --> 04:35:11.680 align:start position:0%
operating so that was just
 
04:35:14.070 --> 04:35:14.080 align:start position:0%
gotten rid of yeah
 
04:35:15.590 --> 04:35:15.600 align:start position:0%
no there was nobody standing up
 
04:35:19.910 --> 04:35:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:22.789 --> 04:35:22.799 align:start position:0%
all right i think i'm set um thank you
 
04:35:24.310 --> 04:35:24.320 align:start position:0%
very much for your testimony we
 
04:35:28.230 --> 04:35:28.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:30.070 --> 04:35:30.080 align:start position:0%
i think uh
 
04:35:32.230 --> 04:35:32.240 align:start position:0%
we're good to go okay
 
04:35:33.750 --> 04:35:33.760 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry to did you have a question
 
04:35:35.429 --> 04:35:35.439 align:start position:0%
about the voter
 
04:35:38.230 --> 04:35:38.240 align:start position:0%
id advisory panel i thought that was
 
04:35:40.390 --> 04:35:40.400 align:start position:0%
coming up in oh okay
 
04:35:42.310 --> 04:35:42.320 align:start position:0%
well i actually she mentioned it to me
 
04:35:46.310 --> 04:35:46.320 align:start position:0%
and i did research on it so um
 
04:35:47.910 --> 04:35:47.920 align:start position:0%
i went back
 
04:35:51.750 --> 04:35:51.760 align:start position:0%
into our minutes that panel was created
 
04:35:54.390 --> 04:35:54.400 align:start position:0%
in 2012 in connection with the adoption
 
04:35:56.310 --> 04:35:56.320 align:start position:0%
of a voter id
 
04:35:56.320 --> 04:35:57.189 align:start position:0%
of a voter id
law

04:35:57.189 --> 04:35:57.199 align:start position:0%
law
 
04:35:57.199 --> 04:35:58.230 align:start position:0%
law
and

04:35:58.230 --> 04:35:58.240 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:35:58.240 --> 04:35:59.429 align:start position:0%
and
we

04:35:59.429 --> 04:35:59.439 align:start position:0%
we
 
04:36:02.709 --> 04:36:02.719 align:start position:0%
repealed it at the recommendation of
 
04:36:05.429 --> 04:36:05.439 align:start position:0%
secretary of state dave scanlon
 
04:36:08.629 --> 04:36:08.639 align:start position:0%
and i called the secretary of state i
 
04:36:10.390 --> 04:36:10.400 align:start position:0%
got off the phone with him maybe 20
 
04:36:11.670 --> 04:36:11.680 align:start position:0%
minutes ago
 
04:36:15.349 --> 04:36:15.359 align:start position:0%
and he said well the first point is that
 
04:36:15.359 --> 04:36:16.629 align:start position:0%
and he said well the first point is that
the

04:36:16.629 --> 04:36:16.639 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:36:20.150 --> 04:36:20.160 align:start position:0%
committee is only convened at the call
 
04:36:22.230 --> 04:36:22.240 align:start position:0%
of the secretary of state
 
04:36:24.390 --> 04:36:24.400 align:start position:0%
and since
 
04:36:26.470 --> 04:36:26.480 align:start position:0%
i mean almost since its creation they
 
04:36:29.910 --> 04:36:29.920 align:start position:0%
haven't seen the need to call it and he
 
04:36:31.830 --> 04:36:31.840 align:start position:0%
said the only reason that he would do it
 
04:36:33.830 --> 04:36:33.840 align:start position:0%
is if there were voter id
 
04:36:36.150 --> 04:36:36.160 align:start position:0%
problems at the polls and he said there
 
04:36:38.470 --> 04:36:38.480 align:start position:0%
really haven't been i know there's a lot
 
04:36:41.670 --> 04:36:41.680 align:start position:0%
of discussion about voter ids but the he
 
04:36:43.590 --> 04:36:43.600 align:start position:0%
said for the most part people present
 
04:36:45.590 --> 04:36:45.600 align:start position:0%
them and there really hasn't been any
 
04:36:48.070 --> 04:36:48.080 align:start position:0%
need to call that panel and it was his
 
04:36:50.310 --> 04:36:50.320 align:start position:0%
strong recommendation that we go ahead
 
04:36:52.470 --> 04:36:52.480 align:start position:0%
and repeal it i mean the only other
 
04:36:55.029 --> 04:36:55.039 align:start position:0%
thing that i would add is that you don't
 
04:36:56.230 --> 04:36:56.240 align:start position:0%
need a
 
04:36:59.189 --> 04:36:59.199 align:start position:0%
voter id advisory panel for the
 
04:37:01.269 --> 04:37:01.279 align:start position:0%
secretary of state to look into the
 
04:37:03.990 --> 04:37:04.000 align:start position:0%
issue it doesn't have to be codified in
 
04:37:06.230 --> 04:37:06.240 align:start position:0%
law so if he wanted to look at it he
 
04:37:09.510 --> 04:37:09.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:12.070 --> 04:37:12.080 align:start position:0%
as he testified to us when we had our
 
04:37:14.470 --> 04:37:14.480 align:start position:0%
committee hearings he reiterated that he
 
04:37:16.230 --> 04:37:16.240 align:start position:0%
thought it would be fine for it to be
 
04:37:18.551 --> 04:37:18.561 align:start position:0%
repealed and he recommended it
 
04:37:21.029 --> 04:37:21.039 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much sure thanks for
 
04:37:23.750 --> 04:37:23.760 align:start position:0%
clarification on that point
 
04:37:23.760 --> 04:37:25.429 align:start position:0%
clarification on that point
um

04:37:25.429 --> 04:37:25.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:37:29.269 --> 04:37:29.279 align:start position:0%
i will grab the pink card here from
 
04:37:31.990 --> 04:37:32.000 align:start position:0%
representative umberger
 
04:37:34.551 --> 04:37:34.561 align:start position:0%
and ask
 
04:37:36.551 --> 04:37:36.561 align:start position:0%

04:37:38.629 --> 04:37:38.639 align:start position:0%
minutes she's speaking in support of the
 
04:37:38.639 --> 04:37:40.949 align:start position:0%
minutes she's speaking in support of the
bill

04:37:40.949 --> 04:37:40.959 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:43.029 --> 04:37:43.039 align:start position:0%
welcome to legislative administration
 
04:37:43.039 --> 04:37:43.830 align:start position:0%

thank you very much uh for the record i
 
04:37:48.949 --> 04:37:48.959 align:start position:0%
am uh representative karen umberger
 
04:37:51.910 --> 04:37:51.920 align:start position:0%
i'm from the conway area
 
04:37:53.590 --> 04:37:53.600 align:start position:0%
and um
 
04:37:57.109 --> 04:37:57.119 align:start position:0%
i am very interested in
 
04:37:58.629 --> 04:37:58.639 align:start position:0%
making sure
 
04:38:00.230 --> 04:38:00.240 align:start position:0%
that we
 
04:38:03.590 --> 04:38:03.600 align:start position:0%
have some sort of review
 
04:38:03.600 --> 04:38:04.470 align:start position:0%
have some sort of review
over

04:38:04.470 --> 04:38:04.480 align:start position:0%
over
 
04:38:09.029 --> 04:38:09.039 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:11.990 --> 04:38:12.000 align:start position:0%
i believe that leadership the
 
04:38:13.670 --> 04:38:13.680 align:start position:0%
the speaker
 
04:38:16.789 --> 04:38:16.799 align:start position:0%
in in particular and deborah childs
 
04:38:16.799 --> 04:38:17.590 align:start position:0%
in in particular and deborah childs
um

04:38:17.590 --> 04:38:17.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:38:19.349 --> 04:38:19.359 align:start position:0%
because of all the work that she has to
 
04:38:19.359 --> 04:38:21.109 align:start position:0%
because of all the work that she has to
do

04:38:21.109 --> 04:38:21.119 align:start position:0%
do
 
04:38:22.789 --> 04:38:22.799 align:start position:0%
believe that
 
04:38:26.230 --> 04:38:26.240 align:start position:0%
somehow or other we have lost our way
 
04:38:27.990 --> 04:38:28.000 align:start position:0%
and that
 
04:38:30.150 --> 04:38:30.160 align:start position:0%
every single item
 
04:38:33.189 --> 04:38:33.199 align:start position:0%
that has the least bit of
 
04:38:33.199 --> 04:38:34.470 align:start position:0%
that has the least bit of
controversy

04:38:34.470 --> 04:38:34.480 align:start position:0%
controversy
 
04:38:38.310 --> 04:38:38.320 align:start position:0%
we create a study committee for
 
04:38:38.320 --> 04:38:39.990 align:start position:0%
we create a study committee for
and

04:38:39.990 --> 04:38:40.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:38:44.949 --> 04:38:44.959 align:start position:0%
the result is this huge proliferation
 
04:38:44.959 --> 04:38:46.470 align:start position:0%
the result is this huge proliferation
of

04:38:46.470 --> 04:38:46.480 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:38:51.269 --> 04:38:51.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:55.269 --> 04:38:55.279 align:start position:0%
deborah's book is about this thick
 
04:38:55.279 --> 04:38:56.230 align:start position:0%
deborah's book is about this thick
with

04:38:56.230 --> 04:38:56.240 align:start position:0%
with
 
04:38:59.189 --> 04:38:59.199 align:start position:0%
all of these committees and commissions
 
04:39:01.670 --> 04:39:01.680 align:start position:0%
and everything else
 
04:39:04.310 --> 04:39:04.320 align:start position:0%
and it has gotten to the point
 
04:39:04.320 --> 04:39:05.429 align:start position:0%
and it has gotten to the point
where

04:39:05.429 --> 04:39:05.439 align:start position:0%
where
 
04:39:08.629 --> 04:39:08.639 align:start position:0%
she can't in many cases can't find
 
04:39:08.639 --> 04:39:09.910 align:start position:0%
she can't in many cases can't find
anyone

04:39:09.910 --> 04:39:09.920 align:start position:0%
anyone
 
04:39:11.910 --> 04:39:11.920 align:start position:0%
doesn't matter whether you're
 
04:39:14.390 --> 04:39:14.400 align:start position:0%
in the majority or the minority
 
04:39:17.750 --> 04:39:17.760 align:start position:0%
she just can't find anyone to serve
 
04:39:20.789 --> 04:39:20.799 align:start position:0%
on many of the committees
 
04:39:24.470 --> 04:39:24.480 align:start position:0%
and so my recommendation to her was
 
04:39:27.269 --> 04:39:27.279 align:start position:0%
whatever person
 
04:39:29.189 --> 04:39:29.199 align:start position:0%
put this bill in
 
04:39:31.109 --> 04:39:31.119 align:start position:0%
is the one that should be in charge of
 
04:39:33.670 --> 04:39:33.680 align:start position:0%
that committee and of course
 
04:39:35.750 --> 04:39:35.760 align:start position:0%
they don't you know the
 
04:39:37.510 --> 04:39:37.520 align:start position:0%
person that put the bill in is not
 
04:39:39.910 --> 04:39:39.920 align:start position:0%
excited about that they want everybody
 
04:39:39.920 --> 04:39:41.190 align:start position:0%
excited about that they want everybody
else

04:39:41.190 --> 04:39:41.200 align:start position:0%
else
 
04:39:45.350 --> 04:39:45.360 align:start position:0%
in the house to uh take care of that
 
04:39:48.070 --> 04:39:48.080 align:start position:0%
but uh representative ebel had done a
 
04:39:50.150 --> 04:39:50.160 align:start position:0%
tremendous amount of work
 
04:39:53.350 --> 04:39:53.360 align:start position:0%
on trying to get
 
04:39:53.360 --> 04:39:54.788 align:start position:0%
on trying to get
control

04:39:54.788 --> 04:39:54.798 align:start position:0%
control
 
04:39:57.990 --> 04:39:58.000 align:start position:0%
of what was going on and i think as she
 
04:39:58.000 --> 04:40:00.868 align:start position:0%
of what was going on and i think as she
explained

04:40:00.868 --> 04:40:00.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:05.350 --> 04:40:05.360 align:start position:0%
because of the problems and the
 
04:40:09.590 --> 04:40:09.600 align:start position:0%
covet problems in the 18 to 20 session
 
04:40:11.030 --> 04:40:11.040 align:start position:0%
that um
 
04:40:13.190 --> 04:40:13.200 align:start position:0%
a lot of bills and this happened to be
 
04:40:17.430 --> 04:40:17.440 align:start position:0%
one of them that really um never got its
 
04:40:19.670 --> 04:40:19.680 align:start position:0%
its full due
 
04:40:23.110 --> 04:40:23.120 align:start position:0%
so when we were talking about it
 
04:40:25.510 --> 04:40:25.520 align:start position:0%
um i guess it was actually five years
 
04:40:25.520 --> 04:40:26.708 align:start position:0%
um i guess it was actually five years
ago

04:40:26.708 --> 04:40:26.718 align:start position:0%
ago
 
04:40:30.788 --> 04:40:30.798 align:start position:0%
uh representative almi and i had worked
 
04:40:30.798 --> 04:40:32.390 align:start position:0%
uh representative almi and i had worked
together

04:40:32.390 --> 04:40:32.400 align:start position:0%
together
 
04:40:32.400 --> 04:40:33.510 align:start position:0%
together
to

04:40:33.510 --> 04:40:33.520 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:40:36.070 --> 04:40:36.080 align:start position:0%
establish a group
 
04:40:37.910 --> 04:40:37.920 align:start position:0%
a committee
 
04:40:40.868 --> 04:40:40.878 align:start position:0%
to review the dedicated funds
 
04:40:44.310 --> 04:40:44.320 align:start position:0%
because dedicated funds were
 
04:40:44.320 --> 04:40:45.990 align:start position:0%
because dedicated funds were
proliferating

04:40:45.990 --> 04:40:46.000 align:start position:0%
proliferating
 
04:40:47.750 --> 04:40:47.760 align:start position:0%
in the same way
 
04:40:47.760 --> 04:40:48.788 align:start position:0%
in the same way
that

04:40:48.788 --> 04:40:48.798 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:40:50.948 --> 04:40:50.958 align:start position:0%
committees commissions councils you name
 
04:40:52.550 --> 04:40:52.560 align:start position:0%
it are
 
04:40:55.110 --> 04:40:55.120 align:start position:0%
continuing to proliferate
 
04:40:56.310 --> 04:40:56.320 align:start position:0%
and so
 
04:40:58.550 --> 04:40:58.560 align:start position:0%
what the bill did and what the committee
 
04:40:58.560 --> 04:40:59.510 align:start position:0%
what the bill did and what the committee
did

04:40:59.510 --> 04:40:59.520 align:start position:0%
did
 
04:41:03.030 --> 04:41:03.040 align:start position:0%
is that over the course of five years
 
04:41:05.590 --> 04:41:05.600 align:start position:0%
we have reviewed
 
04:41:09.350 --> 04:41:09.360 align:start position:0%
every single dedicated fund
 
04:41:13.510 --> 04:41:13.520 align:start position:0%
and many of them have been eliminated
 
04:41:13.520 --> 04:41:15.110 align:start position:0%
and many of them have been eliminated
because

04:41:15.110 --> 04:41:15.120 align:start position:0%
because
 
04:41:17.750 --> 04:41:17.760 align:start position:0%
a they had no money in them
 
04:41:21.670 --> 04:41:21.680 align:start position:0%
or b they had no purpose
 
04:41:24.150 --> 04:41:24.160 align:start position:0%
and as a matter of fact there is a bill
 
04:41:24.160 --> 04:41:25.510 align:start position:0%
and as a matter of fact there is a bill
that

04:41:25.510 --> 04:41:25.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:41:26.440 --> 04:41:26.450 align:start position:0%
we put together
 
04:41:26.450 --> 04:41:27.590 align:start position:0%
we put together
[Music]

04:41:27.590 --> 04:41:27.600 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:41:29.670 --> 04:41:29.680 align:start position:0%
this year for the
 
04:41:31.350 --> 04:41:31.360 align:start position:0%
decade of funds that are going to be
 
04:41:32.628 --> 04:41:32.638 align:start position:0%
going away
 
04:41:36.390 --> 04:41:36.400 align:start position:0%
and being kept and so on so that will be
 
04:41:38.628 --> 04:41:38.638 align:start position:0%
coming up someplace soon
 
04:41:41.430 --> 04:41:41.440 align:start position:0%
but i feel very strongly
 
04:41:43.830 --> 04:41:43.840 align:start position:0%
and i believe representative abel does
 
04:41:44.948 --> 04:41:44.958 align:start position:0%
as well
 
04:41:48.070 --> 04:41:48.080 align:start position:0%
that if we don't follow through
 
04:41:49.990 --> 04:41:50.000 align:start position:0%
and keep track
 
04:41:53.110 --> 04:41:53.120 align:start position:0%
of what's going on with these committees
 
04:41:55.910 --> 04:41:55.920 align:start position:0%
we are never going to get a handle on
 
04:41:58.150 --> 04:41:58.160 align:start position:0%
and it doesn't ma and you know the the
 
04:42:00.310 --> 04:42:00.320 align:start position:0%
other half of the problem
 
04:42:04.230 --> 04:42:04.240 align:start position:0%
is that when the legislature changes
 
04:42:07.110 --> 04:42:07.120 align:start position:0%
from republican to democrat or democrat
 
04:42:09.350 --> 04:42:09.360 align:start position:0%
to republican
 
04:42:11.910 --> 04:42:11.920 align:start position:0%
everything that has occurred
 
04:42:14.470 --> 04:42:14.480 align:start position:0%
over the last two or four years or
 
04:42:17.430 --> 04:42:17.440 align:start position:0%
however long it is kind of gets lost in
 
04:42:19.190 --> 04:42:19.200 align:start position:0%
that transition
 
04:42:22.708 --> 04:42:22.718 align:start position:0%
and so with this
 
04:42:24.628 --> 04:42:24.638 align:start position:0%
with this committee on committees if
 
04:42:24.638 --> 04:42:25.750 align:start position:0%
with this committee on committees if
that's

04:42:25.750 --> 04:42:25.760 align:start position:0%
that's
 
04:42:28.310 --> 04:42:28.320 align:start position:0%
to go through everything every five
 
04:42:28.320 --> 04:42:29.430 align:start position:0%
to go through everything every five
years

04:42:29.430 --> 04:42:29.440 align:start position:0%
years
 
04:42:30.948 --> 04:42:30.958 align:start position:0%
it won't matter
 
04:42:33.350 --> 04:42:33.360 align:start position:0%
who is in charge of the legislature
 
04:42:36.150 --> 04:42:36.160 align:start position:0%
because this committee will continue so
 
04:42:39.110 --> 04:42:39.120 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you um
 
04:42:40.230 --> 04:42:40.240 align:start position:0%
are you
 
04:42:42.550 --> 04:42:42.560 align:start position:0%
willing to answer entertain any
 
04:42:42.560 --> 04:42:44.150 align:start position:0%
willing to answer entertain any
questions

04:42:44.150 --> 04:42:44.160 align:start position:0%
questions
 
04:42:47.830 --> 04:42:47.840 align:start position:0%
uh i can entertain questions on some of
 
04:42:49.030 --> 04:42:49.040 align:start position:0%
this but
 
04:42:52.470 --> 04:42:52.480 align:start position:0%
most of the uh the bill dealing with
 
04:42:54.550 --> 04:42:54.560 align:start position:0%
the things that have been repealed
 
04:42:54.560 --> 04:42:55.670 align:start position:0%
the things that have been repealed
occurred

04:42:55.670 --> 04:42:55.680 align:start position:0%
occurred
 
04:42:58.708 --> 04:42:58.718 align:start position:0%
while i was not in the legislature right
 
04:42:58.718 --> 04:43:00.390 align:start position:0%
while i was not in the legislature right
um

04:43:00.390 --> 04:43:00.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:43:02.150 --> 04:43:02.160 align:start position:0%
question i think from representative
 
04:43:02.160 --> 04:43:02.948 align:start position:0%
question i think from representative
greene

04:43:02.948 --> 04:43:02.958 align:start position:0%
greene
 
04:43:05.830 --> 04:43:05.840 align:start position:0%
yes uh are there dedicated funds
 
04:43:05.840 --> 04:43:07.190 align:start position:0%
yes uh are there dedicated funds
mentioned

04:43:07.190 --> 04:43:07.200 align:start position:0%
mentioned
 
04:43:09.030 --> 04:43:09.040 align:start position:0%
in this bill
 
04:43:11.430 --> 04:43:11.440 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry no they're not
 
04:43:14.470 --> 04:43:14.480 align:start position:0%
no because we have a separate
 
04:43:16.150 --> 04:43:16.160 align:start position:0%
there's a separate committee that
 
04:43:19.670 --> 04:43:19.680 align:start position:0%
reviews those it was just the model
 
04:43:23.030 --> 04:43:23.040 align:start position:0%
that we use to come up with with this
 
04:43:23.040 --> 04:43:24.470 align:start position:0%
that we use to come up with with this
okay

04:43:24.470 --> 04:43:24.480 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:43:31.590 --> 04:43:31.600 align:start position:0%

04:43:45.958 --> 04:43:47.910 align:start position:0%
with that i will close the hearing on
1269

gordon
 
04:44:27.910 --> 04:44:27.920 align:start position:0%
and i'm not the prime sponsor of this
 
04:44:29.190 --> 04:44:29.200 align:start position:0%
bill that's
 
04:44:30.788 --> 04:44:30.798 align:start position:0%
uh representative wolf representative
 
04:44:30.798 --> 04:44:31.990 align:start position:0%
uh representative wolf representative
wolf

04:44:31.990 --> 04:44:32.000 align:start position:0%
wolf
 
04:44:33.670 --> 04:44:33.680 align:start position:0%
uh unfortunately
 
04:44:36.390 --> 04:44:36.400 align:start position:0%
uh had a medical issue today
 
04:44:38.708 --> 04:44:38.718 align:start position:0%
isn't able to be here and he asked if i
 
04:44:40.788 --> 04:44:40.798 align:start position:0%
would come and speak
 
04:44:43.110 --> 04:44:43.120 align:start position:0%
about the bill on his behalf
 
04:44:43.120 --> 04:44:44.230 align:start position:0%
about the bill on his behalf
the

04:44:44.230 --> 04:44:44.240 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:44:46.948 --> 04:44:46.958 align:start position:0%
the bill is very simple and purpose
 
04:44:48.470 --> 04:44:48.480 align:start position:0%
and that is to
 
04:44:51.030 --> 04:44:51.040 align:start position:0%
look at what might constitute an
 
04:44:52.550 --> 04:44:52.560 align:start position:0%
adequate hearing
 
04:44:54.550 --> 04:44:54.560 align:start position:0%
for the trailer bill
 
04:44:58.310 --> 04:44:58.320 align:start position:0%
and from the genesis of this bill comes
 
04:45:00.708 --> 04:45:00.718 align:start position:0%
through representative wolf but his
 
04:45:03.590 --> 04:45:03.600 align:start position:0%
concern at least anecdotally that things
 
04:45:06.470 --> 04:45:06.480 align:start position:0%
tend to appear in the trailer bill
 
04:45:06.480 --> 04:45:07.830 align:start position:0%
tend to appear in the trailer bill
and

04:45:07.830 --> 04:45:07.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:45:11.350 --> 04:45:11.360 align:start position:0%
sometimes somewhat surprisingly as to
 
04:45:13.670 --> 04:45:13.680 align:start position:0%
its content and the question is whether
 
04:45:15.350 --> 04:45:15.360 align:start position:0%
or not it's been
 
04:45:17.030 --> 04:45:17.040 align:start position:0%
properly vetted
 
04:45:19.910 --> 04:45:19.920 align:start position:0%
and properly heard particularly in the
 
04:45:19.920 --> 04:45:21.350 align:start position:0%
and properly heard particularly in the
house

04:45:21.350 --> 04:45:21.360 align:start position:0%
house
 
04:45:22.708 --> 04:45:22.718 align:start position:0%
we all
 
04:45:25.590 --> 04:45:25.600 align:start position:0%
we all i think venerate
 
04:45:27.590 --> 04:45:27.600 align:start position:0%
the idea that
 
04:45:30.470 --> 04:45:30.480 align:start position:0%
the public should be able to have input
 
04:45:33.510 --> 04:45:33.520 align:start position:0%
at uh on all all bills
 
04:45:35.270 --> 04:45:35.280 align:start position:0%
and so
 
04:45:38.070 --> 04:45:38.080 align:start position:0%
he put forward the idea and again this
 
04:45:40.628 --> 04:45:40.638 align:start position:0%
just a follow-up following the exact
 
04:45:42.868 --> 04:45:42.878 align:start position:0%
wrong bill to follow today but this is a
 
04:45:45.270 --> 04:45:45.280 align:start position:0%
study committee
 
04:45:46.550 --> 04:45:46.560 align:start position:0%
it would kind of create a study
 
04:45:48.230 --> 04:45:48.240 align:start position:0%
committee i think the clerk just pointed
 
04:45:50.550 --> 04:45:50.560 align:start position:0%
out to me that the study committee
 
04:45:52.948 --> 04:45:52.958 align:start position:0%
has proposed is made up of house members
 
04:45:54.470 --> 04:45:54.480 align:start position:0%
and senators and it doesn't seem
 
04:45:56.788 --> 04:45:56.798 align:start position:0%
appropriate at all to have senators on a
 
04:45:59.430 --> 04:45:59.440 align:start position:0%
bill with regard to looking at house
 
04:45:59.440 --> 04:46:00.470 align:start position:0%
bill with regard to looking at house
rules

04:46:00.470 --> 04:46:00.480 align:start position:0%
rules
 
04:46:02.550 --> 04:46:02.560 align:start position:0%
and so i think
 
04:46:06.150 --> 04:46:06.160 align:start position:0%
a much better approach would be to
 
04:46:08.470 --> 04:46:08.480 align:start position:0%
have a committee perhaps of five members
 
04:46:10.788 --> 04:46:10.798 align:start position:0%
of the house as opposed to members of
 
04:46:12.390 --> 04:46:12.400 align:start position:0%
the house and senate looking at house
 
04:46:12.400 --> 04:46:15.830 align:start position:0%
the house and senate looking at house
rules

04:46:15.830 --> 04:46:15.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:18.070 --> 04:46:18.080 align:start position:0%
i think that pretty much
 
04:46:21.910 --> 04:46:21.920 align:start position:0%
does my two minutes in terms of a speech
 
04:46:24.868 --> 04:46:24.878 align:start position:0%
i think the question uh it's very just
 
04:46:27.110 --> 04:46:27.120 align:start position:0%
simply a question and that is is it
 
04:46:29.430 --> 04:46:29.440 align:start position:0%
appropriate for us to look at what
 
04:46:32.550 --> 04:46:32.560 align:start position:0%
constitutes appropriate public hearing
 
04:46:35.190 --> 04:46:35.200 align:start position:0%
on the trailer bill
 
04:46:35.200 --> 04:46:36.150 align:start position:0%
on the trailer bill
and

04:46:36.150 --> 04:46:36.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:46:37.910 --> 04:46:37.920 align:start position:0%
that's my testimony
 
04:46:40.070 --> 04:46:40.080 align:start position:0%
thank you are you willing to entertain
 
04:46:42.310 --> 04:46:42.320 align:start position:0%
questions sure sure i'm not sure i can
 
04:46:43.590 --> 04:46:43.600 align:start position:0%
answer them but i'll be happy to
 
04:46:47.430 --> 04:46:47.440 align:start position:0%
entertain them not sure we have any um
 
04:46:50.150 --> 04:46:50.160 align:start position:0%
i don't see any hands up but i do have
 
04:46:51.830 --> 04:46:51.840 align:start position:0%
one um
 
04:46:54.310 --> 04:46:54.320 align:start position:0%
so is it your belief
 
04:46:56.470 --> 04:46:56.480 align:start position:0%
now that
 
04:46:56.480 --> 04:46:59.030 align:start position:0%
now that
um

04:46:59.030 --> 04:46:59.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:01.270 --> 04:47:01.280 align:start position:0%
revisions made to
 
04:47:05.830 --> 04:47:05.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:08.788 --> 04:47:08.798 align:start position:0%
are inappropriate unappropriate because
 
04:47:10.868 --> 04:47:10.878 align:start position:0%
they have
 
04:47:12.628 --> 04:47:12.638 align:start position:0%
they have not had
 
04:47:13.590 --> 04:47:13.600 align:start position:0%
is that
 
04:47:15.350 --> 04:47:15.360 align:start position:0%
your contention
 
04:47:19.430 --> 04:47:19.440 align:start position:0%
no i think my con my contention would be
 
04:47:20.948 --> 04:47:20.958 align:start position:0%
uh that
 
04:47:22.628 --> 04:47:22.638 align:start position:0%
the trailer bill should have adequate
 
04:47:24.868 --> 04:47:24.878 align:start position:0%
public hearing and i'm not sure i know
 
04:47:26.868 --> 04:47:26.878 align:start position:0%
what an adequate public hearing that is
 
04:47:29.270 --> 04:47:29.280 align:start position:0%
where my next question and therefore i
 
04:47:32.470 --> 04:47:32.480 align:start position:0%
think it would be nice for us to define
 
04:47:34.310 --> 04:47:34.320 align:start position:0%
what would be an adequate public hearing
 
04:47:35.990 --> 04:47:36.000 align:start position:0%
and i think that would in essence is the
 
04:47:39.030 --> 04:47:39.040 align:start position:0%
purpose of the study committee
 
04:47:41.990 --> 04:47:42.000 align:start position:0%
um thank you for your answer you're
 
04:47:43.350 --> 04:47:43.360 align:start position:0%
you're not
 
04:47:43.360 --> 04:47:45.350 align:start position:0%
you're not
indicating

04:47:45.350 --> 04:47:45.360 align:start position:0%
indicating
 
04:47:48.150 --> 04:47:48.160 align:start position:0%
here that
 
04:47:51.030 --> 04:47:51.040 align:start position:0%
house rules would be put into statute as
 
04:47:53.270 --> 04:47:53.280 align:start position:0%
a result of this this would
 
04:47:55.910 --> 04:47:55.920 align:start position:0%
merely be
 
04:47:58.310 --> 04:47:58.320 align:start position:0%
looking into it it's a committee that
 
04:48:00.708 --> 04:48:00.718 align:start position:0%
would make a recommendation like other
 
04:48:00.718 --> 04:48:03.830 align:start position:0%
would make a recommendation like other
committees

04:48:03.830 --> 04:48:03.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:06.470 --> 04:48:06.480 align:start position:0%
to back to
 
04:48:06.480 --> 04:48:07.350 align:start position:0%
to back to
no

04:48:07.350 --> 04:48:07.360 align:start position:0%
no
 
04:48:10.230 --> 04:48:10.240 align:start position:0%
does it say report shall we findings for
 
04:48:12.230 --> 04:48:12.240 align:start position:0%
proposed legislation for the speaker
 
04:48:13.910 --> 04:48:13.920 align:start position:0%
president of the senate
 
04:48:15.270 --> 04:48:15.280 align:start position:0%
house clerk
 
04:48:17.510 --> 04:48:17.520 align:start position:0%
presumably you would be changing that as
 
04:48:17.520 --> 04:48:18.788 align:start position:0%
presumably you would be changing that as
well

04:48:18.788 --> 04:48:18.798 align:start position:0%
well
 
04:48:20.150 --> 04:48:20.160 align:start position:0%
um yes
 
04:48:23.350 --> 04:48:23.360 align:start position:0%
that would have to change as well okay
 
04:48:26.628 --> 04:48:26.638 align:start position:0%
um will you be taking up the amendment
 
04:48:29.430 --> 04:48:29.440 align:start position:0%
i will advise representative wolf that
 
04:48:32.390 --> 04:48:32.400 align:start position:0%
an amendment is needed okay
 
04:48:34.628 --> 04:48:34.638 align:start position:0%
thank you very much i don't see any
 
04:48:37.670 --> 04:48:37.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:39.270 --> 04:48:39.280 align:start position:0%
sorry just uh just that i understand
 
04:48:39.280 --> 04:48:40.628 align:start position:0%
sorry just uh just that i understand
things

04:48:40.628 --> 04:48:40.638 align:start position:0%
things
 
04:48:40.638 --> 04:48:41.510 align:start position:0%
things
um

04:48:41.510 --> 04:48:41.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:48:44.788 --> 04:48:44.798 align:start position:0%
so presently the rules committee would
 
04:48:46.948 --> 04:48:46.958 align:start position:0%
oversee how the budget trailer is
 
04:48:46.958 --> 04:48:48.550 align:start position:0%
oversee how the budget trailer is
handled

04:48:48.550 --> 04:48:48.560 align:start position:0%
handled
 
04:48:50.628 --> 04:48:50.638 align:start position:0%
who would who would do that
 
04:48:53.430 --> 04:48:53.440 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure that i'm not sure that's
 
04:48:55.190 --> 04:48:55.200 align:start position:0%
correct in the sense that it oversees
 
04:48:57.030 --> 04:48:57.040 align:start position:0%
how it's handled
 
04:48:58.708 --> 04:48:58.718 align:start position:0%
the rules committee
 
04:49:01.190 --> 04:49:01.200 align:start position:0%
ultimately will make a recommendation as
 
04:49:03.030 --> 04:49:03.040 align:start position:0%
to what rules should be adopted by the
 
04:49:06.230 --> 04:49:06.240 align:start position:0%
house okay thank you
 
04:49:06.240 --> 04:49:07.190 align:start position:0%
house okay thank you
good

04:49:07.190 --> 04:49:07.200 align:start position:0%
good
 
04:49:08.868 --> 04:49:08.878 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative
 
04:49:12.230 --> 04:49:12.240 align:start position:0%
gordon thank you for your courtesy
 
04:49:12.240 --> 04:49:13.750 align:start position:0%
gordon thank you for your courtesy

04:49:16.958 --> 04:49:18.510 align:start position:0%
do have a pink card
from

04:49:18.510 --> 04:49:18.520 align:start position:0%
from
 
04:49:20.948 --> 04:49:20.958 align:start position:0%
representable uh
 
04:49:23.270 --> 04:49:23.280 align:start position:0%
house clerk
 
04:49:25.670 --> 04:49:25.680 align:start position:0%
paul smith
 
04:49:26.948 --> 04:49:26.958 align:start position:0%
welcome again
 
04:49:28.948 --> 04:49:28.958 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chairman and members of
 
04:49:31.670 --> 04:49:31.680 align:start position:0%
the committee uh as as always i'm not
 
04:49:34.550 --> 04:49:34.560 align:start position:0%
testifying in either support
 
04:49:37.830 --> 04:49:37.840 align:start position:0%
or opposed to this legislation
 
04:49:39.670 --> 04:49:39.680 align:start position:0%
i did discuss with one of the
 
04:49:41.350 --> 04:49:41.360 align:start position:0%
co-sponsors representative gordon my
 
04:49:41.360 --> 04:49:42.628 align:start position:0%
co-sponsors representative gordon my
concern

04:49:42.628 --> 04:49:42.638 align:start position:0%
concern
 
04:49:44.788 --> 04:49:44.798 align:start position:0%
uh initially with the drafting of this
 
04:49:46.628 --> 04:49:46.638 align:start position:0%
bill that a study committee about house
 
04:49:48.830 --> 04:49:48.840 align:start position:0%
rules would include members of the other
 
04:49:48.840 --> 04:49:50.788 align:start position:0%
rules would include members of the other
place

04:49:50.788 --> 04:49:50.798 align:start position:0%
place
 
04:49:52.550 --> 04:49:52.560 align:start position:0%
as you know
 
04:49:54.708 --> 04:49:54.718 align:start position:0%
in the legislative process every bill
 
04:49:56.470 --> 04:49:56.480 align:start position:0%
has a hearing
 
04:49:57.670 --> 04:49:57.680 align:start position:0%
the budget
 
04:49:57.680 --> 04:49:58.390 align:start position:0%
the budget
and

04:49:58.390 --> 04:49:58.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:50:00.550 --> 04:50:00.560 align:start position:0%
coincidentally the capital budget and
 
04:50:02.310 --> 04:50:02.320 align:start position:0%
10-year plan
 
04:50:04.310 --> 04:50:04.320 align:start position:0%
tend to change significantly from the
 
04:50:06.708 --> 04:50:06.718 align:start position:0%
time of the initial public hearing
 
04:50:09.750 --> 04:50:09.760 align:start position:0%
to the time of it being exported to the
 
04:50:09.760 --> 04:50:11.110 align:start position:0%
to the time of it being exported to the
body

04:50:11.110 --> 04:50:11.120 align:start position:0%
body
 
04:50:12.788 --> 04:50:12.798 align:start position:0%
uh i would note that our rules do
 
04:50:15.350 --> 04:50:15.360 align:start position:0%
stipulate that before any action can
 
04:50:15.360 --> 04:50:16.150 align:start position:0%
stipulate that before any action can
come

04:50:16.150 --> 04:50:16.160 align:start position:0%
come
 
04:50:16.160 --> 04:50:16.948 align:start position:0%
come
on

04:50:16.948 --> 04:50:16.958 align:start position:0%
on
 
04:50:19.110 --> 04:50:19.120 align:start position:0%
a final vote of the budget or trailer
 
04:50:20.868 --> 04:50:20.878 align:start position:0%
bill a full
 
04:50:23.030 --> 04:50:23.040 align:start position:0%
presentation has to happen to all house
 
04:50:23.040 --> 04:50:25.350 align:start position:0%
presentation has to happen to all house
members

04:50:25.350 --> 04:50:25.360 align:start position:0%
members
 
04:50:25.360 --> 04:50:26.628 align:start position:0%
members
um

04:50:26.628 --> 04:50:26.638 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:50:28.550 --> 04:50:28.560 align:start position:0%
i would note that
 
04:50:28.560 --> 04:50:30.708 align:start position:0%
i would note that
historically

04:50:30.708 --> 04:50:30.718 align:start position:0%
historically
 
04:50:32.628 --> 04:50:32.638 align:start position:0%
the house
 
04:50:35.190 --> 04:50:35.200 align:start position:0%
tends to not place
 
04:50:35.200 --> 04:50:36.830 align:start position:0%
tends to not place
mainly

04:50:36.830 --> 04:50:36.840 align:start position:0%
mainly
 
04:50:38.868 --> 04:50:38.878 align:start position:0%
non-budgetary items
 
04:50:38.878 --> 04:50:40.070 align:start position:0%
non-budgetary items
in

04:50:40.070 --> 04:50:40.080 align:start position:0%
in
 
04:50:41.670 --> 04:50:41.680 align:start position:0%
the trailer bill
 
04:50:44.390 --> 04:50:44.400 align:start position:0%
that tends to happen as most of you know
 
04:50:47.270 --> 04:50:47.280 align:start position:0%
in the aforementioned other place
 
04:50:49.830 --> 04:50:49.840 align:start position:0%
uh it's not anything new it's been
 
04:50:51.670 --> 04:50:51.680 align:start position:0%
happening for years
 
04:50:51.680 --> 04:50:52.868 align:start position:0%
happening for years
um

04:50:52.868 --> 04:50:52.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:50:55.110 --> 04:50:55.120 align:start position:0%
and i would just note that
 
04:50:58.070 --> 04:50:58.080 align:start position:0%
uh i i think that
 
04:51:00.788 --> 04:51:00.798 align:start position:0%
you you really need to consider
 
04:51:03.190 --> 04:51:03.200 align:start position:0%
what can and can't come
 
04:51:03.200 --> 04:51:04.310 align:start position:0%
what can and can't come
from

04:51:04.310 --> 04:51:04.320 align:start position:0%
from
 
04:51:06.628 --> 04:51:06.638 align:start position:0%
this type of discussion uh the fact of
 
04:51:08.868 --> 04:51:08.878 align:start position:0%
the matter is we can't control the other
 
04:51:10.230 --> 04:51:10.240 align:start position:0%
place's rules
 
04:51:13.190 --> 04:51:13.200 align:start position:0%
nor fortunately can they control ours
 
04:51:15.910 --> 04:51:15.920 align:start position:0%
though sometimes they try
 
04:51:17.830 --> 04:51:17.840 align:start position:0%
i would also note
 
04:51:19.830 --> 04:51:19.840 align:start position:0%
that for those of you who work with
 
04:51:21.510 --> 04:51:21.520 align:start position:0%
house rules or have worked with house
 
04:51:21.520 --> 04:51:23.350 align:start position:0%
house rules or have worked with house
rules

04:51:23.350 --> 04:51:23.360 align:start position:0%
rules
 
04:51:25.750 --> 04:51:25.760 align:start position:0%
historically the
 
04:51:27.030 --> 04:51:27.040 align:start position:0%
any member
 
04:51:28.868 --> 04:51:28.878 align:start position:0%
will approach the clerk and have a
 
04:51:28.878 --> 04:51:29.990 align:start position:0%
will approach the clerk and have a
discussion

04:51:29.990 --> 04:51:30.000 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
04:51:32.708 --> 04:51:32.718 align:start position:0%
about rules and i work with all members
 
04:51:34.550 --> 04:51:34.560 align:start position:0%
regarding rules and rules proposals
 
04:51:36.628 --> 04:51:36.638 align:start position:0%
whether or not i think they are a good
 
04:51:38.788 --> 04:51:38.798 align:start position:0%
idea or not
 
04:51:41.590 --> 04:51:41.600 align:start position:0%
it is my job to work with members in
 
04:51:43.350 --> 04:51:43.360 align:start position:0%
implementing their ideas so that they
 
04:51:44.708 --> 04:51:44.718 align:start position:0%
can present them before the rules
 
04:51:46.470 --> 04:51:46.480 align:start position:0%
committee and ultimately
 
04:51:48.470 --> 04:51:48.480 align:start position:0%
whether the committee agrees with those
 
04:51:50.070 --> 04:51:50.080 align:start position:0%
proposals or not
 
04:51:51.510 --> 04:51:51.520 align:start position:0%
and makes that recommendation to the
 
04:51:51.520 --> 04:51:53.190 align:start position:0%
and makes that recommendation to the
floor

04:51:53.190 --> 04:51:53.200 align:start position:0%
floor
 
04:51:55.590 --> 04:51:55.600 align:start position:0%
so i would simply note that
 
04:51:58.470 --> 04:51:58.480 align:start position:0%
i think a study committee to study
 
04:52:01.670 --> 04:52:01.680 align:start position:0%
amending the house rules
 
04:52:04.310 --> 04:52:04.320 align:start position:0%
if you want to amend the house rules
 
04:52:06.230 --> 04:52:06.240 align:start position:0%
amend the house rules
 
04:52:08.708 --> 04:52:08.718 align:start position:0%
i don't again as as we've discussed
 
04:52:11.510 --> 04:52:11.520 align:start position:0%
before about legislating
 
04:52:14.310 --> 04:52:14.320 align:start position:0%
legislative process
 
04:52:16.868 --> 04:52:16.878 align:start position:0%
in policy i think that there's a means
 
04:52:18.550 --> 04:52:18.560 align:start position:0%
to handle that within the existing
 
04:52:21.990 --> 04:52:22.000 align:start position:0%
frameworks of the legislative process
 
04:52:23.750 --> 04:52:23.760 align:start position:0%
so i would just note that
 
04:52:26.470 --> 04:52:26.480 align:start position:0%
i think in the in these circumstances
 
04:52:28.550 --> 04:52:28.560 align:start position:0%
because we cannot control the other body
 
04:52:30.470 --> 04:52:30.480 align:start position:0%
that nor can they control us
 
04:52:31.830 --> 04:52:31.840 align:start position:0%
um that
 
04:52:34.788 --> 04:52:34.798 align:start position:0%
a if until a full and fair discussion
 
04:52:37.110 --> 04:52:37.120 align:start position:0%
happens regarding rules and whether or
 
04:52:39.670 --> 04:52:39.680 align:start position:0%
not that includes returning to the idea
 
04:52:41.750 --> 04:52:41.760 align:start position:0%
of joint rules
 
04:52:44.230 --> 04:52:44.240 align:start position:0%
which we have adopted in the past but we
 
04:52:49.030 --> 04:52:49.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:51.350 --> 04:52:51.360 align:start position:0%
that the odds of of changing the
 
04:52:53.030 --> 04:52:53.040 align:start position:0%
fundamental process
 
04:52:55.750 --> 04:52:55.760 align:start position:0%
of of the hearing and the disposition of
 
04:52:58.070 --> 04:52:58.080 align:start position:0%
those bills i'm not sure how to
 
04:52:59.830 --> 04:52:59.840 align:start position:0%
accomplish that uh
 
04:53:02.310 --> 04:53:02.320 align:start position:0%
in in that kind of conversation
 
04:53:02.320 --> 04:53:03.430 align:start position:0%
in in that kind of conversation
so

04:53:03.430 --> 04:53:03.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:53:04.830 --> 04:53:04.840 align:start position:0%

05:02:01.750 --> 05:02:01.760 align:start position:0%
we just know
 
05:02:03.910 --> 05:02:03.920 align:start position:0%
that the ethics committee has received
 
05:02:07.190 --> 05:02:07.200 align:start position:0%
more complaints in 2021 than any other
 
05:02:08.948 --> 05:02:08.958 align:start position:0%
year in its
 
05:02:08.958 --> 05:02:11.190 align:start position:0%
year in its
existence

05:02:11.190 --> 05:02:11.200 align:start position:0%
existence
 
05:02:11.200 --> 05:02:13.750 align:start position:0%
existence
marketing

05:02:13.750 --> 05:02:13.760 align:start position:0%
marketing
 
05:02:15.990 --> 05:02:16.000 align:start position:0%
yeah we i guess we have to stop
 
05:02:18.230 --> 05:02:18.240 align:start position:0%
advertising yeah
 
05:02:20.390 --> 05:02:20.400 align:start position:0%
unfortunately many of them involve the
 
05:02:21.670 --> 05:02:21.680 align:start position:0%
internet or
 
05:02:24.390 --> 05:02:24.400 align:start position:0%
or social media but
 
05:02:27.990 --> 05:02:28.000 align:start position:0%
um it's not our job really to police and
 
05:02:30.470 --> 05:02:30.480 align:start position:0%
we don't do that but our job is to hear
 
05:02:32.470 --> 05:02:32.480 align:start position:0%
complaints when they are brought to us
 
05:02:35.270 --> 05:02:35.280 align:start position:0%
and we do address them
 
05:02:37.750 --> 05:02:37.760 align:start position:0%
one of one of the issues that we've
 
05:02:39.190 --> 05:02:39.200 align:start position:0%
discovered as
 
05:02:42.310 --> 05:02:42.320 align:start position:0%
we've addressed those issues
 
05:02:44.070 --> 05:02:44.080 align:start position:0%
is that
 
05:02:44.080 --> 05:02:46.390 align:start position:0%
is that
our

05:02:46.390 --> 05:02:46.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:49.430 --> 05:02:49.440 align:start position:0%
statutory format and our ethics
 
05:02:49.440 --> 05:02:51.030 align:start position:0%
statutory format and our ethics
guidelines

05:02:51.030 --> 05:02:51.040 align:start position:0%
guidelines
 
05:02:53.190 --> 05:02:53.200 align:start position:0%
do not address the issue of recusal at
 
05:02:53.200 --> 05:02:54.550 align:start position:0%
do not address the issue of recusal at
all

05:02:54.550 --> 05:02:54.560 align:start position:0%
all
 
05:02:54.560 --> 05:02:57.190 align:start position:0%
all
and

05:02:57.190 --> 05:02:57.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:59.910 --> 05:02:59.920 align:start position:0%
i sent out or i had sent out this
 
05:03:02.788 --> 05:03:02.798 align:start position:0%
morning a copy of this which is research
 
05:03:05.030 --> 05:03:05.040 align:start position:0%
that was done and with
 
05:03:05.040 --> 05:03:05.990 align:start position:0%
that was done and with
the

05:03:05.990 --> 05:03:06.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:03:07.830 --> 05:03:07.840 align:start position:0%
the law which applies to all of the
 
05:03:10.390 --> 05:03:10.400 align:start position:0%
other states and virtually all of those
 
05:03:13.110 --> 05:03:13.120 align:start position:0%
other states have provisions with regard
 
05:03:13.120 --> 05:03:14.070 align:start position:0%
other states have provisions with regard
to

05:03:14.070 --> 05:03:14.080 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:03:16.628 --> 05:03:16.638 align:start position:0%
legislative recusal when people are
 
05:03:18.310 --> 05:03:18.320 align:start position:0%
involved in issues in which they may
 
05:03:22.948 --> 05:03:22.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:24.470 --> 05:03:24.480 align:start position:0%
and i'll address that a little bit
 
05:03:24.480 --> 05:03:25.830 align:start position:0%
and i'll address that a little bit
further

05:03:25.830 --> 05:03:25.840 align:start position:0%
further
 
05:03:25.840 --> 05:03:26.628 align:start position:0%
further
our

05:03:26.628 --> 05:03:26.638 align:start position:0%
our
 
05:03:29.430 --> 05:03:29.440 align:start position:0%
statute our guidelines
 
05:03:32.230 --> 05:03:32.240 align:start position:0%
do not address recusal at all
 
05:03:32.240 --> 05:03:34.868 align:start position:0%
do not address recusal at all
and

05:03:34.868 --> 05:03:34.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:37.270 --> 05:03:37.280 align:start position:0%
if you you were if you if you were to
 
05:03:38.708 --> 05:03:38.718 align:start position:0%
read them you would believe that there
 
05:03:40.470 --> 05:03:40.480 align:start position:0%
would know that there wouldn't be any
 
05:03:42.628 --> 05:03:42.638 align:start position:0%
circumstance where you'd be required to
 
05:03:44.150 --> 05:03:44.160 align:start position:0%
recuse yourself
 
05:03:45.830 --> 05:03:45.840 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
05:03:48.470 --> 05:03:48.480 align:start position:0%
in the past has found that there are
 
05:03:50.948 --> 05:03:50.958 align:start position:0%
circumstances where recusal is
 
05:03:50.958 --> 05:03:52.150 align:start position:0%
circumstances where recusal is
appropriate

05:03:52.150 --> 05:03:52.160 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
05:03:53.990 --> 05:03:54.000 align:start position:0%
where people may have some direct
 
05:03:56.708 --> 05:03:56.718 align:start position:0%
benefit or work for an employer that has
 
05:03:59.830 --> 05:03:59.840 align:start position:0%
some direct benefit but there are times
 
05:03:59.840 --> 05:04:00.628 align:start position:0%
some direct benefit but there are times
when

05:04:00.628 --> 05:04:00.638 align:start position:0%
when
 
05:04:02.788 --> 05:04:02.798 align:start position:0%
recusal is an appropriate outcome and
 
05:04:04.470 --> 05:04:04.480 align:start position:0%
the committee has found that
 
05:04:07.270 --> 05:04:07.280 align:start position:0%
and indicated that to people who have
 
05:04:09.590 --> 05:04:09.600 align:start position:0%
inquired or have had complaints in the
 
05:04:09.600 --> 05:04:10.628 align:start position:0%
inquired or have had complaints in the
past

05:04:10.628 --> 05:04:10.638 align:start position:0%
past
 
05:04:10.638 --> 05:04:11.830 align:start position:0%
past
so

05:04:11.830 --> 05:04:11.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:04:13.990 --> 05:04:14.000 align:start position:0%
the question is how to go about dealing
 
05:04:15.350 --> 05:04:15.360 align:start position:0%
with that
 
05:04:15.360 --> 05:04:16.628 align:start position:0%
with that
and

05:04:16.628 --> 05:04:16.638 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:04:19.430 --> 05:04:19.440 align:start position:0%
we think that we need to uh and just
 
05:04:22.070 --> 05:04:22.080 align:start position:0%
just in terms of background
 
05:04:22.080 --> 05:04:24.470 align:start position:0%
just in terms of background
uh

05:04:24.470 --> 05:04:24.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:25.990 --> 05:04:26.000 align:start position:0%
we uh our
 
05:04:27.830 --> 05:04:27.840 align:start position:0%
our ethics guidelines were brought about
 
05:04:30.550 --> 05:04:30.560 align:start position:0%
because we had a an issue here in the
 
05:04:32.390 --> 05:04:32.400 align:start position:0%
house in particular
 
05:04:35.430 --> 05:04:35.440 align:start position:0%
was somebody who was involved with
 
05:04:37.510 --> 05:04:37.520 align:start position:0%
financially with someone and then
 
05:04:41.190 --> 05:04:41.200 align:start position:0%
advocating for that party legislatively
 
05:04:43.110 --> 05:04:43.120 align:start position:0%
and as a result of that the ethics
 
05:04:46.390 --> 05:04:46.400 align:start position:0%
guidelines were promoted and our ethics
 
05:04:49.430 --> 05:04:49.440 align:start position:0%
guidelines deal primarily with financial
 
05:04:49.440 --> 05:04:50.948 align:start position:0%
guidelines deal primarily with financial
interests

05:04:50.948 --> 05:04:50.958 align:start position:0%
interests
 
05:04:54.948 --> 05:04:54.958 align:start position:0%
they don't generally deal with just
 
05:04:57.030 --> 05:04:57.040 align:start position:0%
issues of behavior
 
05:04:59.350 --> 05:04:59.360 align:start position:0%
although the house
 
05:05:01.270 --> 05:05:01.280 align:start position:0%
at least the legislative facilities
 
05:05:03.510 --> 05:05:03.520 align:start position:0%
committee has adopted a harassment
 
05:05:05.830 --> 05:05:05.840 align:start position:0%
policy and discrimination policy and
 
05:05:07.750 --> 05:05:07.760 align:start position:0%
told us that we're to reinforce that and
 
05:05:09.270 --> 05:05:09.280 align:start position:0%
we have been doing that but for the most
 
05:05:11.430 --> 05:05:11.440 align:start position:0%
part our ethics guidelines deal with
 
05:05:14.708 --> 05:05:14.718 align:start position:0%
finding financial matters
 
05:05:17.350 --> 05:05:17.360 align:start position:0%
but again there's no provision for
 
05:05:19.670 --> 05:05:19.680 align:start position:0%
recusal so that what this bill tries to
 
05:05:19.680 --> 05:05:20.550 align:start position:0%
recusal so that what this bill tries to
do

05:05:20.550 --> 05:05:20.560 align:start position:0%
do
 
05:05:21.590 --> 05:05:21.600 align:start position:0%
is to
 
05:05:21.600 --> 05:05:23.350 align:start position:0%
is to
uh

05:05:23.350 --> 05:05:23.360 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:05:26.310 --> 05:05:26.320 align:start position:0%
identify the circumstances where recusal
 
05:05:29.030 --> 05:05:29.040 align:start position:0%
would be appropriate i might add that
 
05:05:31.430 --> 05:05:31.440 align:start position:0%
our constitution provides
 
05:05:31.440 --> 05:05:32.230 align:start position:0%
our constitution provides
for

05:05:32.230 --> 05:05:32.240 align:start position:0%
for
 
05:05:32.240 --> 05:05:34.628 align:start position:0%
for
recusal

05:05:34.628 --> 05:05:34.638 align:start position:0%
recusal
 
05:05:34.638 --> 05:05:35.350 align:start position:0%
recusal
in

05:05:35.350 --> 05:05:35.360 align:start position:0%
in
 
05:05:37.510 --> 05:05:37.520 align:start position:0%
part 2 article 7
 
05:05:39.030 --> 05:05:39.040 align:start position:0%
it indicates that no member of the
 
05:05:40.868 --> 05:05:40.878 align:start position:0%
general court shall take fees be of
 
05:05:43.190 --> 05:05:43.200 align:start position:0%
counsel or act as an advocate in any
 
05:05:44.788 --> 05:05:44.798 align:start position:0%
cause before either branch of the
 
05:05:47.670 --> 05:05:47.680 align:start position:0%
legislature and upon due proof such
 
05:05:49.590 --> 05:05:49.600 align:start position:0%
members shall forfeit his seat in the
 
05:05:49.600 --> 05:05:51.350 align:start position:0%
members shall forfeit his seat in the
legislature

05:05:51.350 --> 05:05:51.360 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
05:05:55.830 --> 05:05:55.840 align:start position:0%
so even as early as the late 1700s
 
05:05:58.510 --> 05:05:58.520 align:start position:0%
there was a concern with regard to
 
05:05:58.520 --> 05:06:00.390 align:start position:0%
there was a concern with regard to
[Music]

05:06:00.390 --> 05:06:00.400 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
05:06:04.150 --> 05:06:04.160 align:start position:0%
people having conflicts of interest
 
05:06:07.110 --> 05:06:07.120 align:start position:0%
so this particular bill sets forth for
 
05:06:09.190 --> 05:06:09.200 align:start position:0%
circumstances where it would be
 
05:06:11.670 --> 05:06:11.680 align:start position:0%
appropriate for someone
 
05:06:14.628 --> 05:06:14.638 align:start position:0%
to recuse themselves the first if they
 
05:06:16.868 --> 05:06:16.878 align:start position:0%
have a special interest in an official
 
05:06:19.190 --> 05:06:19.200 align:start position:0%
legislative activity
 
05:06:21.510 --> 05:06:21.520 align:start position:0%
and special interest is later defined
 
05:06:23.670 --> 05:06:23.680 align:start position:0%
but a special interest is something
 
05:06:23.680 --> 05:06:24.788 align:start position:0%
but a special interest is something
where

05:06:24.788 --> 05:06:24.798 align:start position:0%
where
 
05:06:24.798 --> 05:06:25.670 align:start position:0%
where
you

05:06:25.670 --> 05:06:25.680 align:start position:0%
you
 
05:06:28.150 --> 05:06:28.160 align:start position:0%
would get a greater benefit than the
 
05:06:30.788 --> 05:06:30.798 align:start position:0%
public in general a substantially a
 
05:06:32.550 --> 05:06:32.560 align:start position:0%
substantially greater benefit than the
 
05:06:35.270 --> 05:06:35.280 align:start position:0%
public in general
 
05:06:38.708 --> 05:06:38.718 align:start position:0%
it's not intended to exclude everybody
 
05:06:40.708 --> 05:06:40.718 align:start position:0%
right now if you have a conflict in this
 
05:06:42.310 --> 05:06:42.320 align:start position:0%
state you just declare a conflict of
 
05:06:46.948 --> 05:06:46.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:48.628 --> 05:06:48.638 align:start position:0%
indicating that you have a conflict and
 
05:06:50.070 --> 05:06:50.080 align:start position:0%
then you choose whether to participate
 
05:06:52.788 --> 05:06:52.798 align:start position:0%
or not to participate well there are
 
05:06:54.230 --> 05:06:54.240 align:start position:0%
circumstances where you shouldn't be
 
05:06:55.510 --> 05:06:55.520 align:start position:0%
participating and that's when you're
 
05:06:57.110 --> 05:06:57.120 align:start position:0%
going to get a substantial financial
 
05:06:58.948 --> 05:06:58.958 align:start position:0%
benefit as a result of that or your
 
05:07:01.190 --> 05:07:01.200 align:start position:0%
employer is
 
05:07:01.200 --> 05:07:02.708 align:start position:0%
employer is
and

05:07:02.708 --> 05:07:02.718 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:07:02.718 --> 05:07:03.670 align:start position:0%
and
it

05:07:03.670 --> 05:07:03.680 align:start position:0%
it
 
05:07:05.910 --> 05:07:05.920 align:start position:0%
there may be circumstances and we've
 
05:07:07.670 --> 05:07:07.680 align:start position:0%
discussed like current use right now we
 
05:07:09.430 --> 05:07:09.440 align:start position:0%
have an issue with regard to current use
 
05:07:11.750 --> 05:07:11.760 align:start position:0%
if you have property and current use
 
05:07:14.310 --> 05:07:14.320 align:start position:0%
you may get a differential benefit but
 
05:07:15.750 --> 05:07:15.760 align:start position:0%
it's not really
 
05:07:18.230 --> 05:07:18.240 align:start position:0%
larger than anybody else who has
 
05:07:20.708 --> 05:07:20.718 align:start position:0%
current use in the state and therefore
 
05:07:23.270 --> 05:07:23.280 align:start position:0%
you probably need to declare a conflict
 
05:07:24.868 --> 05:07:24.878 align:start position:0%
but you probably don't need to recuse
 
05:07:27.110 --> 05:07:27.120 align:start position:0%
yourself for that
 
05:07:29.270 --> 05:07:29.280 align:start position:0%
but if you were
 
05:07:31.590 --> 05:07:31.600 align:start position:0%
to get some type of special award from
 
05:07:33.750 --> 05:07:33.760 align:start position:0%
the state and that would be directly
 
05:07:36.070 --> 05:07:36.080 align:start position:0%
paid to you or a household member
 
05:07:38.070 --> 05:07:38.080 align:start position:0%
then you probably should be recusing
 
05:07:38.080 --> 05:07:41.030 align:start position:0%
then you probably should be recusing
yourself

05:07:41.030 --> 05:07:41.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:43.030 --> 05:07:43.040 align:start position:0%
so if you have if an individual has a
 
05:07:44.868 --> 05:07:44.878 align:start position:0%
special interest in official legislative
 
05:07:44.878 --> 05:07:47.030 align:start position:0%
special interest in official legislative
activity

05:07:47.030 --> 05:07:47.040 align:start position:0%
activity
 
05:07:48.948 --> 05:07:48.958 align:start position:0%
if receiving remuneration from an
 
05:07:51.270 --> 05:07:51.280 align:start position:0%
employer which has special
 
05:07:53.750 --> 05:07:53.760 align:start position:0%
uh activity we had a
 
05:07:53.760 --> 05:07:54.788 align:start position:0%
uh activity we had a
case

05:07:54.788 --> 05:07:54.798 align:start position:0%
case
 
05:07:57.590 --> 05:07:57.600 align:start position:0%
uh involving exactly that circumstance
 
05:08:00.708 --> 05:08:00.718 align:start position:0%
and uh involved and god
 
05:08:03.030 --> 05:08:03.040 align:start position:0%
may rest in peace douglas
 
05:08:04.868 --> 05:08:04.878 align:start position:0%
which was published
 
05:08:06.788 --> 05:08:06.798 align:start position:0%
where he was working for employer
 
05:08:09.030 --> 05:08:09.040 align:start position:0%
basically being played and paid and
 
05:08:11.910 --> 05:08:11.920 align:start position:0%
advocating for legislation and the
 
05:08:13.270 --> 05:08:13.280 align:start position:0%
committee found that recusal was
 
05:08:16.150 --> 05:08:16.160 align:start position:0%
appropriate in those circumstances
 
05:08:19.430 --> 05:08:19.440 align:start position:0%
and that's basically what generated this
 
05:08:19.440 --> 05:08:21.270 align:start position:0%
and that's basically what generated this
legislation

05:08:21.270 --> 05:08:21.280 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
05:08:23.590 --> 05:08:23.600 align:start position:0%
or if you're acting as counsel or
 
05:08:25.430 --> 05:08:25.440 align:start position:0%
serving as an attorney for any party
 
05:08:27.910 --> 05:08:27.920 align:start position:0%
which has a spencer special interest in
 
05:08:30.470 --> 05:08:30.480 align:start position:0%
official legislation
 
05:08:33.110 --> 05:08:33.120 align:start position:0%
so if you're acting for an attorney if
 
05:08:35.030 --> 05:08:35.040 align:start position:0%
you're an attorney
 
05:08:37.510 --> 05:08:37.520 align:start position:0%
you still have attorney-client privilege
 
05:08:38.948 --> 05:08:38.958 align:start position:0%
but if you're acting as an attorney for
 
05:08:40.550 --> 05:08:40.560 align:start position:0%
someone and they have a special interest
 
05:08:43.270 --> 05:08:43.280 align:start position:0%
here you really shouldn't be voting on
 
05:08:43.280 --> 05:08:44.310 align:start position:0%
here you really shouldn't be voting on
there

05:08:44.310 --> 05:08:44.320 align:start position:0%
there
 
05:08:45.750 --> 05:08:45.760 align:start position:0%
on things that are going to affect them
 
05:08:45.760 --> 05:08:47.110 align:start position:0%
on things that are going to affect them
directly

05:08:47.110 --> 05:08:47.120 align:start position:0%
directly
 
05:08:49.430 --> 05:08:49.440 align:start position:0%
and finally if you're someone who serves
 
05:08:51.030 --> 05:08:51.040 align:start position:0%
in an official capacity in an
 
05:08:51.040 --> 05:08:52.470 align:start position:0%
in an official capacity in an
organization

05:08:52.470 --> 05:08:52.480 align:start position:0%
organization
 
05:08:54.470 --> 05:08:54.480 align:start position:0%
whether non-profit or for-profit which
 
05:08:56.310 --> 05:08:56.320 align:start position:0%
is a subject of official
 
05:08:59.270 --> 05:08:59.280 align:start position:0%
and that would be uh
 
05:09:01.990 --> 05:09:02.000 align:start position:0%
which is typically being on a hospital
 
05:09:02.000 --> 05:09:03.670 align:start position:0%
which is typically being on a hospital
board

05:09:03.670 --> 05:09:03.680 align:start position:0%
board
 
05:09:03.680 --> 05:09:04.788 align:start position:0%
board
and

05:09:04.788 --> 05:09:04.798 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:09:05.830 --> 05:09:05.840 align:start position:0%
and all of a sudden there's a
 
05:09:08.070 --> 05:09:08.080 align:start position:0%
legislation piece of legislation that
 
05:09:11.030 --> 05:09:11.040 align:start position:0%
involves specifically merger of that
 
05:09:13.270 --> 05:09:13.280 align:start position:0%
hospital with another hospital
 
05:09:14.868 --> 05:09:14.878 align:start position:0%
should you should recuse yourself on
 
05:09:14.878 --> 05:09:17.110 align:start position:0%
should you should recuse yourself on
that

05:09:17.110 --> 05:09:17.120 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:09:17.120 --> 05:09:18.550 align:start position:0%
that
so

05:09:18.550 --> 05:09:18.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:09:18.560 --> 05:09:19.270 align:start position:0%
so
and

05:09:19.270 --> 05:09:19.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:09:21.430 --> 05:09:21.440 align:start position:0%
the bill is intended to deal with those
 
05:09:23.190 --> 05:09:23.200 align:start position:0%
types of conflicts the types of
 
05:09:25.190 --> 05:09:25.200 align:start position:0%
conflicts where somebody
 
05:09:27.750 --> 05:09:27.760 align:start position:0%
or the person that they work for is
 
05:09:29.750 --> 05:09:29.760 align:start position:0%
going to receive some type of
 
05:09:32.070 --> 05:09:32.080 align:start position:0%
substantial benefit beyond what other
 
05:09:33.590 --> 05:09:33.600 align:start position:0%
people would receive or what the public
 
05:09:35.590 --> 05:09:35.600 align:start position:0%
would receive and they should recuse
 
05:09:37.990 --> 05:09:38.000 align:start position:0%
themselves i sent this
 
05:09:40.230 --> 05:09:40.240 align:start position:0%
out today
 
05:09:41.990 --> 05:09:42.000 align:start position:0%
this is research that was done on
 
05:09:44.150 --> 05:09:44.160 align:start position:0%
recusal provisions
 
05:09:47.830 --> 05:09:47.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:50.470 --> 05:09:50.480 align:start position:0%
is probably unlike most of the others in
 
05:09:52.390 --> 05:09:52.400 align:start position:0%
that most other states
 
05:09:54.310 --> 05:09:54.320 align:start position:0%
almost all the other states have recusal
 
05:09:54.320 --> 05:09:55.670 align:start position:0%
almost all the other states have recusal
provisions

05:09:55.670 --> 05:09:55.680 align:start position:0%
provisions
 
05:09:56.788 --> 05:09:56.798 align:start position:0%
but they're
 
05:09:59.750 --> 05:09:59.760 align:start position:0%
like they're so broad they're
 
05:09:59.760 --> 05:10:00.708 align:start position:0%
like they're so broad they're
uh

05:10:00.708 --> 05:10:00.718 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:10:03.190 --> 05:10:03.200 align:start position:0%
if you read through them
 
05:10:03.200 --> 05:10:05.030 align:start position:0%
if you read through them
uh

05:10:05.030 --> 05:10:05.040 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:10:07.110 --> 05:10:07.120 align:start position:0%
if uh
 
05:10:09.830 --> 05:10:09.840 align:start position:0%
a member uh where he accused himself
 
05:10:11.350 --> 05:10:11.360 align:start position:0%
this is in kentucky if they have a
 
05:10:12.948 --> 05:10:12.958 align:start position:0%
personal or private interest in any
 
05:10:17.270 --> 05:10:17.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:18.708 --> 05:10:18.718 align:start position:0%
we'd have a lot of people recusing
 
05:10:20.150 --> 05:10:20.160 align:start position:0%
themselves a lot of the time in this
 
05:10:20.160 --> 05:10:22.310 align:start position:0%
themselves a lot of the time in this
legislature

05:10:22.310 --> 05:10:22.320 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
05:10:25.030 --> 05:10:25.040 align:start position:0%
in maryland it's uh if someone has an
 
05:10:26.628 --> 05:10:26.638 align:start position:0%
immediate personal
 
05:10:29.830 --> 05:10:29.840 align:start position:0%
or financial interest
 
05:10:31.990 --> 05:10:32.000 align:start position:0%
in massachusetts if it will
 
05:10:33.990 --> 05:10:34.000 align:start position:0%
substantially impair their independence
 
05:10:35.910 --> 05:10:35.920 align:start position:0%
of judgment they need to recuse
 
05:10:35.920 --> 05:10:38.310 align:start position:0%
of judgment they need to recuse
themselves

05:10:38.310 --> 05:10:38.320 align:start position:0%
themselves
 
05:10:39.590 --> 05:10:39.600 align:start position:0%
in michigan
 
05:10:41.750 --> 05:10:41.760 align:start position:0%
a senator having personal private or
 
05:10:43.670 --> 05:10:43.680 align:start position:0%
professional interest in a bill or
 
05:10:46.230 --> 05:10:46.240 align:start position:0%
alternative measure
 
05:10:48.310 --> 05:10:48.320 align:start position:0%
has to recuse themselves
 
05:10:50.310 --> 05:10:50.320 align:start position:0%
in mississippi no senator shall be
 
05:10:51.830 --> 05:10:51.840 align:start position:0%
permitted to act
 
05:10:54.708 --> 05:10:54.718 align:start position:0%
on any question in his pri which in his
 
05:10:56.230 --> 05:10:56.240 align:start position:0%
question in his private interest
 
05:10:58.788 --> 05:10:58.798 align:start position:0%
distinct from the public interest
 
05:11:00.948 --> 05:11:00.958 align:start position:0%
so you can see uh
 
05:11:03.430 --> 05:11:03.440 align:start position:0%
as you go around the country they
 
05:11:05.510 --> 05:11:05.520 align:start position:0%
virtually all estates have them and
 
05:11:07.110 --> 05:11:07.120 align:start position:0%
they're very broad and what we've tried
 
05:11:08.628 --> 05:11:08.638 align:start position:0%
to do in this bill is try to make it as
 
05:11:09.910 --> 05:11:09.920 align:start position:0%
narrow as
 
05:11:11.590 --> 05:11:11.600 align:start position:0%
we possibly can
 
05:11:11.600 --> 05:11:12.550 align:start position:0%
we possibly can
because

05:11:12.550 --> 05:11:12.560 align:start position:0%
because
 
05:11:14.390 --> 05:11:14.400 align:start position:0%
we realize that there are lots of people
 
05:11:15.990 --> 05:11:16.000 align:start position:0%
that have interests in various types of
 
05:11:16.000 --> 05:11:17.510 align:start position:0%
that have interests in various types of
businesses

05:11:17.510 --> 05:11:17.520 align:start position:0%
businesses
 
05:11:19.510 --> 05:11:19.520 align:start position:0%
that can afford to be here
 
05:11:21.910 --> 05:11:21.920 align:start position:0%
if you work for an insurance
 
05:11:23.750 --> 05:11:23.760 align:start position:0%
business for example
 
05:11:25.590 --> 05:11:25.600 align:start position:0%
there are questions involving insurance
 
05:11:27.030 --> 05:11:27.040 align:start position:0%
and unless you're going to get a direct
 
05:11:28.310 --> 05:11:28.320 align:start position:0%
benefit from them you shouldn't have to
 
05:11:30.708 --> 05:11:30.718 align:start position:0%
recuse yourself about insurance
 
05:11:33.190 --> 05:11:33.200 align:start position:0%
but if it means that you're going to be
 
05:11:35.190 --> 05:11:35.200 align:start position:0%
paid a substantial amount of money as a
 
05:11:37.190 --> 05:11:37.200 align:start position:0%
result of some increase in premiums
 
05:11:40.070 --> 05:11:40.080 align:start position:0%
maybe you should recuse yourself and
 
05:11:42.390 --> 05:11:42.400 align:start position:0%
and so there is a difference so long in
 
05:11:43.430 --> 05:11:43.440 align:start position:0%
the short
 
05:11:46.230 --> 05:11:46.240 align:start position:0%
i think it's time that we put in some
 
05:11:49.110 --> 05:11:49.120 align:start position:0%
type of recusal provision in our
 
05:11:50.868 --> 05:11:50.878 align:start position:0%
first of all we've recognized already
 
05:11:53.110 --> 05:11:53.120 align:start position:0%
that recusal is an appropriate outcome
 
05:11:55.670 --> 05:11:55.680 align:start position:0%
for legislators in new hampshire
 
05:11:57.990 --> 05:11:58.000 align:start position:0%
and i think there needs to be some
 
05:12:00.230 --> 05:12:00.240 align:start position:0%
notice put in our guidelines as to when
 
05:12:01.670 --> 05:12:01.680 align:start position:0%
you need to do that
 
05:12:04.150 --> 05:12:04.160 align:start position:0%
that's my testimony great thank you very
 
05:12:06.550 --> 05:12:06.560 align:start position:0%
much for your
 
05:12:10.070 --> 05:12:10.080 align:start position:0%
complete testimony um will you entertain
 
05:12:13.110 --> 05:12:13.120 align:start position:0%
questions certainly
 
05:12:15.910 --> 05:12:15.920 align:start position:0%
representative simon
 
05:12:17.590 --> 05:12:17.600 align:start position:0%
uh so just looking over this what is the
 
05:12:20.070 --> 05:12:20.080 align:start position:0%
threshold or the kind of the limiting
 
05:12:22.390 --> 05:12:22.400 align:start position:0%
factor for when somebody should recuse
 
05:12:23.590 --> 05:12:23.600 align:start position:0%
themselves or shouldn't recuse
 
05:12:23.600 --> 05:12:24.628 align:start position:0%
themselves or shouldn't recuse
themselves

05:12:24.628 --> 05:12:24.638 align:start position:0%
themselves
 
05:12:27.110 --> 05:12:27.120 align:start position:0%
like is that for the ethics committee to
 
05:12:29.030 --> 05:12:29.040 align:start position:0%
determine or
 
05:12:30.390 --> 05:12:30.400 align:start position:0%
who would determine that kind of
 
05:12:33.190 --> 05:12:33.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:35.110 --> 05:12:35.120 align:start position:0%
well i think
 
05:12:36.550 --> 05:12:36.560 align:start position:0%
i i
 
05:12:37.590 --> 05:12:37.600 align:start position:0%
just like
 
05:12:39.110 --> 05:12:39.120 align:start position:0%
i couldn't find in any of the states
 
05:12:41.510 --> 05:12:41.520 align:start position:0%
where they have a specific threshold
 
05:12:44.230 --> 05:12:44.240 align:start position:0%
standard like that right and
 
05:12:45.910 --> 05:12:45.920 align:start position:0%
so ultimately
 
05:12:45.920 --> 05:12:48.868 align:start position:0%
so ultimately
uh

05:12:48.868 --> 05:12:48.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:50.868 --> 05:12:50.878 align:start position:0%
ultimately i guess if somebody has to
 
05:12:52.948 --> 05:12:52.958 align:start position:0%
make that determination it would be the
 
05:12:55.030 --> 05:12:55.040 align:start position:0%
ethics committee and the way things
 
05:12:56.708 --> 05:12:56.718 align:start position:0%
currently operate
 
05:12:58.310 --> 05:12:58.320 align:start position:0%
and i don't think the as i said the
 
05:13:01.510 --> 05:13:01.520 align:start position:0%
ethics committee isn't looking to
 
05:13:02.788 --> 05:13:02.798 align:start position:0%
the ethics committee our ethics
 
05:13:05.030 --> 05:13:05.040 align:start position:0%
committee isn't a punitive committee
 
05:13:07.990 --> 05:13:08.000 align:start position:0%
what we try to do is is
 
05:13:10.948 --> 05:13:10.958 align:start position:0%
educate legislators as best we can
 
05:13:10.958 --> 05:13:11.990 align:start position:0%
educate legislators as best we can
and

05:13:11.990 --> 05:13:12.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:13:13.910 --> 05:13:13.920 align:start position:0%
there are times when it could be
 
05:13:15.510 --> 05:13:15.520 align:start position:0%
punitive and
 
05:13:17.750 --> 05:13:17.760 align:start position:0%
when it's totally appropriate to be so
 
05:13:20.390 --> 05:13:20.400 align:start position:0%
but we try to avoid that all together
 
05:13:21.670 --> 05:13:21.680 align:start position:0%
if we can
 
05:13:21.680 --> 05:13:23.430 align:start position:0%
if we can
because

05:13:23.430 --> 05:13:23.440 align:start position:0%
because
 
05:13:24.628 --> 05:13:24.638 align:start position:0%
we know
 
05:13:26.708 --> 05:13:26.718 align:start position:0%
the legislators here
 
05:13:28.708 --> 05:13:28.718 align:start position:0%
are here because
 
05:13:30.070 --> 05:13:30.080 align:start position:0%
they're not because they're making a lot
 
05:13:32.230 --> 05:13:32.240 align:start position:0%
of money they're here because they're
 
05:13:34.628 --> 05:13:34.638 align:start position:0%
dedicated and they're working hard and
 
05:13:37.750 --> 05:13:37.760 align:start position:0%
they want to do the best job they can
 
05:13:39.030 --> 05:13:39.040 align:start position:0%
and so
 
05:13:41.030 --> 05:13:41.040 align:start position:0%
i think the la if it actually came down
 
05:13:43.110 --> 05:13:43.120 align:start position:0%
to that as to what is a substantial
 
05:13:44.550 --> 05:13:44.560 align:start position:0%
outcome i think
 
05:13:46.788 --> 05:13:46.798 align:start position:0%
would give an advisory opinion from the
 
05:13:52.550 --> 05:13:52.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:53.670 --> 05:13:53.680 align:start position:0%
if somebody
 
05:13:55.110 --> 05:13:55.120 align:start position:0%
should have recused themselves or it
 
05:13:56.948 --> 05:13:56.958 align:start position:0%
came into question over whether somebody
 
05:13:58.550 --> 05:13:58.560 align:start position:0%
should have recused themselves and they
 
05:14:01.110 --> 05:14:01.120 align:start position:0%
did not recuse themselves that would i
 
05:14:02.550 --> 05:14:02.560 align:start position:0%
would assume go before the ethics
 
05:14:04.150 --> 05:14:04.160 align:start position:0%
committee and then the ethics committee
 
05:14:05.430 --> 05:14:05.440 align:start position:0%
could or could not depending on the
 
05:14:05.440 --> 05:14:07.750 align:start position:0%
could or could not depending on the
circumstance

05:14:07.750 --> 05:14:07.760 align:start position:0%
circumstance
 
05:14:09.190 --> 05:14:09.200 align:start position:0%
come up with some punitive action
 
05:14:11.110 --> 05:14:11.120 align:start position:0%
against against the member depending on
 
05:14:13.830 --> 05:14:13.840 align:start position:0%
how egregious it was or right if if it
 
05:14:16.310 --> 05:14:16.320 align:start position:0%
was some if it was something obvious
 
05:14:16.320 --> 05:14:17.270 align:start position:0%
was some if it was something obvious
you

05:14:17.270 --> 05:14:17.280 align:start position:0%
you
 
05:14:18.788 --> 05:14:18.798 align:start position:0%
you might
 
05:14:18.798 --> 05:14:19.590 align:start position:0%
you might
and

05:14:19.590 --> 05:14:19.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:14:22.948 --> 05:14:22.958 align:start position:0%
and for and they had notice
 
05:14:25.030 --> 05:14:25.040 align:start position:0%
that there was a problem
 
05:14:28.070 --> 05:14:28.080 align:start position:0%
and they went forward and did it anyway
 
05:14:30.788 --> 05:14:30.798 align:start position:0%
um then i'm sure you know punitive
 
05:14:32.868 --> 05:14:32.878 align:start position:0%
measures might be appropriate
 
05:14:34.390 --> 05:14:34.400 align:start position:0%
i would say that the ethics committee
 
05:14:36.310 --> 05:14:36.320 align:start position:0%
doesn't punish anybody
 
05:14:37.750 --> 05:14:37.760 align:start position:0%
the only thing the ethics committee can
 
05:14:39.990 --> 05:14:40.000 align:start position:0%
do is make recommendations
 
05:14:42.230 --> 05:14:42.240 align:start position:0%
so we can recommend a censure or
 
05:14:44.708 --> 05:14:44.718 align:start position:0%
reprimand or removal
 
05:14:46.470 --> 05:14:46.480 align:start position:0%
but the legislature has to vote on that
 
05:14:46.480 --> 05:14:47.990 align:start position:0%
but the legislature has to vote on that
okay

05:14:47.990 --> 05:14:48.000 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:14:48.000 --> 05:14:48.868 align:start position:0%
okay
and

05:14:48.868 --> 05:14:48.878 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:14:50.708 --> 05:14:50.718 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
05:14:53.750 --> 05:14:53.760 align:start position:0%
in that particular case generally if
 
05:14:55.750 --> 05:14:55.760 align:start position:0%
somebody violated and they didn't do it
 
05:14:58.390 --> 05:14:58.400 align:start position:0%
intentionally we probably would address
 
05:15:00.390 --> 05:15:00.400 align:start position:0%
it appropriately without some type of
 
05:15:02.550 --> 05:15:02.560 align:start position:0%
punitive measure if we thought somebody
 
05:15:04.948 --> 05:15:04.958 align:start position:0%
violated it and they knew better at the
 
05:15:06.470 --> 05:15:06.480 align:start position:0%
time and did it then
 
05:15:08.070 --> 05:15:08.080 align:start position:0%
some type of punitive measure might be
 
05:15:08.080 --> 05:15:09.350 align:start position:0%
some type of punitive measure might be
recommended

05:15:09.350 --> 05:15:09.360 align:start position:0%
recommended
 
05:15:10.628 --> 05:15:10.638 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:15:11.990 --> 05:15:12.000 align:start position:0%
and i suspect that's how it works in
 
05:15:16.230 --> 05:15:16.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:16.240 --> 05:15:18.470 align:start position:0%
 
roulade

05:15:18.470 --> 05:15:18.480 align:start position:0%
roulade
 
05:15:20.628 --> 05:15:20.638 align:start position:0%
hi thanks for taking my question
 
05:15:20.638 --> 05:15:22.390 align:start position:0%
hi thanks for taking my question
um

05:15:22.390 --> 05:15:22.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:15:24.470 --> 05:15:24.480 align:start position:0%
my question actually
 
05:15:26.948 --> 05:15:26.958 align:start position:0%
is taken from page two
 
05:15:29.990 --> 05:15:30.000 align:start position:0%
section five special interests
 
05:15:32.310 --> 05:15:32.320 align:start position:0%
and it's the non-financial personal
 
05:15:34.070 --> 05:15:34.080 align:start position:0%
interests that i'm going to ask you
 
05:15:34.080 --> 05:15:36.390 align:start position:0%
interests that i'm going to ask you
about

05:15:36.390 --> 05:15:36.400 align:start position:0%
about
 
05:15:36.400 --> 05:15:37.830 align:start position:0%
about
so

05:15:37.830 --> 05:15:37.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:15:40.550 --> 05:15:40.560 align:start position:0%
we as legislators
 
05:15:42.628 --> 05:15:42.638 align:start position:0%
have an awful lot of folks that contact
 
05:15:45.190 --> 05:15:45.200 align:start position:0%
us that are considered lobbyists
 
05:15:48.470 --> 05:15:48.480 align:start position:0%
that want us to vote a certain way
 
05:15:51.510 --> 05:15:51.520 align:start position:0%
in exchange for
 
05:15:54.310 --> 05:15:54.320 align:start position:0%
perhaps non-financial gain
 
05:15:56.470 --> 05:15:56.480 align:start position:0%
promote supporting sending flyers on
 
05:15:57.750 --> 05:15:57.760 align:start position:0%
your behalf
 
05:15:59.910 --> 05:15:59.920 align:start position:0%
lobbying to get you elected
 
05:16:01.910 --> 05:16:01.920 align:start position:0%
if you vote a certain way
 
05:16:06.150 --> 05:16:06.160 align:start position:0%
on whatever it is is that considered
 
05:16:10.830 --> 05:16:10.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:10.840 --> 05:16:12.470 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:16:12.470 --> 05:16:12.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:16:14.628 --> 05:16:14.638 align:start position:0%
to the detriment or the benefit direct
 
05:16:18.868 --> 05:16:18.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:23.030 --> 05:16:23.040 align:start position:0%
i that may very well be a violation of
 
05:16:25.510 --> 05:16:25.520 align:start position:0%
the current ethics guidelines
 
05:16:30.150 --> 05:16:30.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:30.160 --> 05:16:31.510 align:start position:0%
 
are

05:16:31.510 --> 05:16:31.520 align:start position:0%
are
 
05:16:31.520 --> 05:16:33.750 align:start position:0%
are
voting

05:16:33.750 --> 05:16:33.760 align:start position:0%
voting
 
05:16:36.150 --> 05:16:36.160 align:start position:0%
if you have if somebody is calling you
 
05:16:39.190 --> 05:16:39.200 align:start position:0%
up and saying i'm going to
 
05:16:41.590 --> 05:16:41.600 align:start position:0%
send out a flyer on your behalf because
 
05:16:45.270 --> 05:16:45.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:47.510 --> 05:16:47.520 align:start position:0%
in hopes that you will vote this
 
05:16:51.270 --> 05:16:51.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:53.510 --> 05:16:53.520 align:start position:0%
that may have
 
05:16:55.510 --> 05:16:55.520 align:start position:0%
implications that go beyond simple
 
05:17:00.550 --> 05:17:00.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:03.030 --> 05:17:03.040 align:start position:0%
follow up yeah follow up not necessarily
 
05:17:04.628 --> 05:17:04.638 align:start position:0%
on that particular question but it
 
05:17:08.310 --> 05:17:08.320 align:start position:0%
brings a lot of things to mind not only
 
05:17:09.830 --> 05:17:09.840 align:start position:0%
with lobbyists but with other
 
05:17:11.670 --> 05:17:11.680 align:start position:0%
individuals that
 
05:17:13.910 --> 05:17:13.920 align:start position:0%
are requesting that you vote a certain
 
05:17:13.920 --> 05:17:14.788 align:start position:0%
are requesting that you vote a certain
way

05:17:14.788 --> 05:17:14.798 align:start position:0%
way
 
05:17:16.550 --> 05:17:16.560 align:start position:0%
or there'll be
 
05:17:20.628 --> 05:17:20.638 align:start position:0%
some issues that you have to deal with
 
05:17:22.628 --> 05:17:22.638 align:start position:0%
is that
 
05:17:25.830 --> 05:17:25.840 align:start position:0%
and you do vote that way is that
 
05:17:29.830 --> 05:17:29.840 align:start position:0%
a violation of the ethics
 
05:17:31.110 --> 05:17:31.120 align:start position:0%
rules that we're putting forward here
 
05:17:34.230 --> 05:17:34.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:34.240 --> 05:17:35.110 align:start position:0%
 
well

05:17:35.110 --> 05:17:35.120 align:start position:0%
well
 
05:17:35.120 --> 05:17:37.830 align:start position:0%
well
they're

05:17:37.830 --> 05:17:37.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:43.750 --> 05:17:43.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:46.230 --> 05:17:46.240 align:start position:0%
this isn't meant to stump you yeah no no
 
05:17:48.310 --> 05:17:48.320 align:start position:0%
no it's great i'm just trying to figure
 
05:17:50.868 --> 05:17:50.878 align:start position:0%
out some of the things that happen that
 
05:17:52.230 --> 05:17:52.240 align:start position:0%
you see
 
05:17:55.030 --> 05:17:55.040 align:start position:0%
and now looking at the rules as written
 
05:17:57.670 --> 05:17:57.680 align:start position:0%
could there be a
 
05:17:57.680 --> 05:17:59.350 align:start position:0%
could there be a
violation

05:17:59.350 --> 05:17:59.360 align:start position:0%
violation
 
05:18:00.470 --> 05:18:00.480 align:start position:0%
per se
 
05:18:03.110 --> 05:18:03.120 align:start position:0%
well if there's a quid pro quo i think
 
05:18:05.510 --> 05:18:05.520 align:start position:0%
there's a violation so
 
05:18:07.350 --> 05:18:07.360 align:start position:0%
if you're voting in exchange for some
 
05:18:10.150 --> 05:18:10.160 align:start position:0%
type of benefit then you have a problem
 
05:18:10.160 --> 05:18:11.750 align:start position:0%
type of benefit then you have a problem
if

05:18:11.750 --> 05:18:11.760 align:start position:0%
if
 
05:18:14.390 --> 05:18:14.400 align:start position:0%
if you are
 
05:18:16.390 --> 05:18:16.400 align:start position:0%
you know typically lobbyists contribute
 
05:18:19.430 --> 05:18:19.440 align:start position:0%
to campaigns they do that
 
05:18:21.830 --> 05:18:21.840 align:start position:0%
they may talk to you about legislation
 
05:18:25.270 --> 05:18:25.280 align:start position:0%
and and the benefits of legislation
 
05:18:28.310 --> 05:18:28.320 align:start position:0%
and there's no quid pro quo
 
05:18:31.110 --> 05:18:31.120 align:start position:0%
but if somebody is suggesting that you
 
05:18:33.350 --> 05:18:33.360 align:start position:0%
vote in a particular way in exchange for
 
05:18:35.510 --> 05:18:35.520 align:start position:0%
some remuneration
 
05:18:37.670 --> 05:18:37.680 align:start position:0%
whether it be financial or otherwise i
 
05:18:41.430 --> 05:18:41.440 align:start position:0%
think that's problematic thank you
 
05:18:44.788 --> 05:18:44.798 align:start position:0%
further questions i have a couple
 
05:18:48.390 --> 05:18:48.400 align:start position:0%
one is do we have a special
 
05:18:50.788 --> 05:18:50.798 align:start position:0%
problem here um in new hampshire i'll
 
05:18:52.550 --> 05:18:52.560 align:start position:0%
call it a problem or maybe it's an
 
05:18:54.150 --> 05:18:54.160 align:start position:0%
opportunity depending on your point of
 
05:18:57.670 --> 05:18:57.680 align:start position:0%
view um a special problem because we are
 
05:19:00.948 --> 05:19:00.958 align:start position:0%
truly a citizen legislature we are
 
05:19:04.868 --> 05:19:04.878 align:start position:0%
typically working in in another field
 
05:19:04.878 --> 05:19:05.670 align:start position:0%
typically working in in another field
than

05:19:05.670 --> 05:19:05.680 align:start position:0%
than
 
05:19:08.868 --> 05:19:08.878 align:start position:0%
maybe other places that have dedicated
 
05:19:10.708 --> 05:19:10.718 align:start position:0%
legislators is that
 
05:19:13.190 --> 05:19:13.200 align:start position:0%
part of our issue or part of our problem
 
05:19:13.200 --> 05:19:15.590 align:start position:0%
part of our issue or part of our problem
yeah

05:19:15.590 --> 05:19:15.600 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:19:18.070 --> 05:19:18.080 align:start position:0%
i i don't um
 
05:19:19.270 --> 05:19:19.280 align:start position:0%
frankly i'm not sure that we have a
 
05:19:20.788 --> 05:19:20.798 align:start position:0%
problem you know
 
05:19:22.868 --> 05:19:22.878 align:start position:0%
so well we have more complaints this
 
05:19:25.510 --> 05:19:25.520 align:start position:0%
year than ever so yeah well i think
 
05:19:27.670 --> 05:19:27.680 align:start position:0%
anywhere i guess i'm saying do we have a
 
05:19:29.110 --> 05:19:29.120 align:start position:0%
more of a
 
05:19:29.120 --> 05:19:31.270 align:start position:0%
more of a
um

05:19:31.270 --> 05:19:31.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:19:34.788 --> 05:19:34.798 align:start position:0%
more of a difficulty in drafting
 
05:19:37.590 --> 05:19:37.600 align:start position:0%
these types of when you shouldn't when
 
05:19:40.788 --> 05:19:40.798 align:start position:0%
you shouldn't because we are in
 
05:19:43.590 --> 05:19:43.600 align:start position:0%
businesses and and industries and every
 
05:19:45.270 --> 05:19:45.280 align:start position:0%
other thing that
 
05:19:46.470 --> 05:19:46.480 align:start position:0%
that touch
 
05:19:48.470 --> 05:19:48.480 align:start position:0%
the legislation that we're working with
 
05:19:49.990 --> 05:19:50.000 align:start position:0%
maybe that's a better way to say yeah i
 
05:19:51.830 --> 05:19:51.840 align:start position:0%
think uh yeah and i and i think that's
 
05:19:52.948 --> 05:19:52.958 align:start position:0%
right i think
 
05:19:54.470 --> 05:19:54.480 align:start position:0%
that's why we might want to be more
 
05:19:56.868 --> 05:19:56.878 align:start position:0%
specific as to when you have to recuse
 
05:19:58.230 --> 05:19:58.240 align:start position:0%
yourself than a lot of these other
 
05:19:59.430 --> 05:19:59.440 align:start position:0%
people who just say if you have a
 
05:20:01.190 --> 05:20:01.200 align:start position:0%
personal interest in it right you have
 
05:20:03.110 --> 05:20:03.120 align:start position:0%
to recuse yourself if we did that in our
 
05:20:03.120 --> 05:20:04.390 align:start position:0%
to recuse yourself if we did that in our
legislature

05:20:04.390 --> 05:20:04.400 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
05:20:06.150 --> 05:20:06.160 align:start position:0%
we'd have half the body walking out
 
05:20:08.470 --> 05:20:08.480 align:start position:0%
sometimes so um
 
05:20:11.590 --> 05:20:11.600 align:start position:0%
so yeah i think that that probably
 
05:20:11.600 --> 05:20:12.788 align:start position:0%
so yeah i think that that probably
has

05:20:12.788 --> 05:20:12.798 align:start position:0%
has
 
05:20:16.550 --> 05:20:16.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:18.390 --> 05:20:18.400 align:start position:0%
and i can't see how it's possible would
 
05:20:21.910 --> 05:20:21.920 align:start position:0%
we ever get to a a time in place where
 
05:20:21.920 --> 05:20:23.030 align:start position:0%
we ever get to a a time in place where
um

05:20:23.030 --> 05:20:23.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:20:24.948 --> 05:20:24.958 align:start position:0%
representatives at the beginning of the
 
05:20:26.548 --> 05:20:26.558 align:start position:0%
session are handed
 
05:20:26.558 --> 05:20:27.350 align:start position:0%
session are handed
um

05:20:27.350 --> 05:20:27.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:20:29.670 --> 05:20:29.680 align:start position:0%
these are your recusal
 
05:20:29.680 --> 05:20:30.708 align:start position:0%
these are your recusal
um

05:20:30.708 --> 05:20:30.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:20:32.788 --> 05:20:32.798 align:start position:0%
opportunities and these are your declare
 
05:20:35.910 --> 05:20:35.920 align:start position:0%
conflict opportunities i i can't see how
 
05:20:39.110 --> 05:20:39.120 align:start position:0%
because it seems that every situation
 
05:20:41.590 --> 05:20:41.600 align:start position:0%
as you just saw with
 
05:20:42.948 --> 05:20:42.958 align:start position:0%
the discussion with representative
 
05:20:42.958 --> 05:20:44.150 align:start position:0%
the discussion with representative
roulard

05:20:44.150 --> 05:20:44.160 align:start position:0%
roulard
 
05:20:47.670 --> 05:20:47.680 align:start position:0%
every situation has nuances and
 
05:20:52.150 --> 05:20:52.160 align:start position:0%
and are subject to well it depends um
 
05:20:53.990 --> 05:20:54.000 align:start position:0%
statements so
 
05:20:56.948 --> 05:20:56.958 align:start position:0%
i i'm not sure that this is it's kind of
 
05:20:59.910 --> 05:20:59.920 align:start position:0%
defining a cloud you know
 
05:21:02.868 --> 05:21:02.878 align:start position:0%
it depends on
 
05:21:05.750 --> 05:21:05.760 align:start position:0%
what we see at the time yeah
 
05:21:05.760 --> 05:21:06.548 align:start position:0%
what we see at the time yeah
i

05:21:06.548 --> 05:21:06.558 align:start position:0%
i
 
05:21:08.628 --> 05:21:08.638 align:start position:0%
frankly as as as far as i'm concerned
 
05:21:10.470 --> 05:21:10.480 align:start position:0%
it's sort of like the law
 
05:21:12.708 --> 05:21:12.718 align:start position:0%
you know we pass all these laws here but
 
05:21:13.910 --> 05:21:13.920 align:start position:0%
you get up in the morning you don't have
 
05:21:15.110 --> 05:21:15.120 align:start position:0%
to read the law book to know what you're
 
05:21:17.030 --> 05:21:17.040 align:start position:0%
supposed to do that day because you know
 
05:21:18.548 --> 05:21:18.558 align:start position:0%
right from wrong
 
05:21:18.558 --> 05:21:20.070 align:start position:0%
right from wrong
and

05:21:20.070 --> 05:21:20.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:21:21.910 --> 05:21:21.920 align:start position:0%
and as long as you
 
05:21:23.750 --> 05:21:23.760 align:start position:0%
act right you
 
05:21:25.270 --> 05:21:25.280 align:start position:0%
don't have to be concerned about getting
 
05:21:27.510 --> 05:21:27.520 align:start position:0%
arrested or violating the law
 
05:21:27.520 --> 05:21:28.548 align:start position:0%
arrested or violating the law
and

05:21:28.548 --> 05:21:28.558 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:21:30.548 --> 05:21:30.558 align:start position:0%
i think that's true with the ethics
 
05:21:33.510 --> 05:21:33.520 align:start position:0%
guidelines as well i think
 
05:21:36.310 --> 05:21:36.320 align:start position:0%
if you have some concern
 
05:21:38.708 --> 05:21:38.718 align:start position:0%
then you ought to qualify that and we do
 
05:21:39.990 --> 05:21:40.000 align:start position:0%
get calls
 
05:21:43.270 --> 05:21:43.280 align:start position:0%
questions all the time as to
 
05:21:44.948 --> 05:21:44.958 align:start position:0%
whether that people should do this or
 
05:21:47.430 --> 05:21:47.440 align:start position:0%
that recuse themselves or
 
05:21:49.590 --> 05:21:49.600 align:start position:0%
or participate or
 
05:21:51.750 --> 05:21:51.760 align:start position:0%
file the declaration forms
 
05:21:53.590 --> 05:21:53.600 align:start position:0%
i can tell you
 
05:21:54.948 --> 05:21:54.958 align:start position:0%
there are so many times when people
 
05:21:57.190 --> 05:21:57.200 align:start position:0%
should be filing the declaration forms
 
05:21:59.510 --> 05:21:59.520 align:start position:0%
they don't file the declaration forms
 
05:22:01.590 --> 05:22:01.600 align:start position:0%
but we're not out looking for those p
 
05:22:04.070 --> 05:22:04.080 align:start position:0%
we're not out looking for those people
 
05:22:06.470 --> 05:22:06.480 align:start position:0%
um if somebody wanted to make an issue
 
05:22:08.230 --> 05:22:08.240 align:start position:0%
potentially they could
 
05:22:10.310 --> 05:22:10.320 align:start position:0%
but again we're not a police force
 
05:22:13.190 --> 05:22:13.200 align:start position:0%
that's not our intention uh no but a tap
 
05:22:14.948 --> 05:22:14.958 align:start position:0%
on a shoulder every once in a while and
 
05:22:17.110 --> 05:22:17.120 align:start position:0%
say have you thought of this
 
05:22:20.310 --> 05:22:20.320 align:start position:0%
may go a long way i mean i i i truly
 
05:22:22.628 --> 05:22:22.638 align:start position:0%
believe in new hampshire and this may be
 
05:22:24.788 --> 05:22:24.798 align:start position:0%
more on my soapbox than anything else
 
05:22:27.430 --> 05:22:27.440 align:start position:0%
but i i truly believe
 
05:22:27.440 --> 05:22:28.230 align:start position:0%
but i i truly believe
it's

05:22:28.230 --> 05:22:28.240 align:start position:0%
it's
 
05:22:31.110 --> 05:22:31.120 align:start position:0%
it's omission rather than commission i
 
05:22:33.190 --> 05:22:33.200 align:start position:0%
think we i think we're just
 
05:22:33.200 --> 05:22:34.310 align:start position:0%
think we i think we're just
um

05:22:34.310 --> 05:22:34.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:22:36.310 --> 05:22:36.320 align:start position:0%
thinking we're doing all right and we
 
05:22:38.470 --> 05:22:38.480 align:start position:0%
never gave it a thought i bet would be
 
05:22:40.470 --> 05:22:40.480 align:start position:0%
the comment that most people
 
05:22:42.628 --> 05:22:42.638 align:start position:0%
um when it's pointed out to them would
 
05:22:44.548 --> 05:22:44.558 align:start position:0%
be saying oh gee i never even thought of
 
05:22:44.558 --> 05:22:46.150 align:start position:0%
be saying oh gee i never even thought of
that

05:22:46.150 --> 05:22:46.160 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:22:47.750 --> 05:22:47.760 align:start position:0%
it is um
 
05:22:49.350 --> 05:22:49.360 align:start position:0%
and i think it all comes back to this
 
05:22:50.948 --> 05:22:50.958 align:start position:0%
fact that we have
 
05:22:53.030 --> 05:22:53.040 align:start position:0%
our lives that are touched in so many
 
05:22:55.670 --> 05:22:55.680 align:start position:0%
other places because we're still working
 
05:22:57.590 --> 05:22:57.600 align:start position:0%
and we're still doing all of those other
 
05:22:59.510 --> 05:22:59.520 align:start position:0%
things that
 
05:23:01.510 --> 05:23:01.520 align:start position:0%
we're not just dedicated citizens
 
05:23:01.520 --> 05:23:03.350 align:start position:0%
we're not just dedicated citizens
legislators

05:23:03.350 --> 05:23:03.360 align:start position:0%
legislators
 
05:23:03.360 --> 05:23:04.070 align:start position:0%
legislators
and

05:23:04.070 --> 05:23:04.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:23:05.990 --> 05:23:06.000 align:start position:0%
i can tell you that
 
05:23:08.948 --> 05:23:08.958 align:start position:0%
of the complaints that we've received
 
05:23:11.510 --> 05:23:11.520 align:start position:0%
this year
 
05:23:12.470 --> 05:23:12.480 align:start position:0%
i don't
 
05:23:14.470 --> 05:23:14.480 align:start position:0%
know that we received one single
 
05:23:14.480 --> 05:23:15.670 align:start position:0%
know that we received one single
complaint

05:23:15.670 --> 05:23:15.680 align:start position:0%
complaint
 
05:23:18.708 --> 05:23:18.718 align:start position:0%
that was specifically involving

05:23:27.350 --> 05:23:27.360 align:start position:0%
most of the complaints have involved
 
05:23:31.350 --> 05:23:31.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:33.670 --> 05:23:33.680 align:start position:0%

and i have
 
05:24:09.190 --> 05:24:09.200 align:start position:0%

05:25:17.270 --> 05:25:17.280 align:start position:0%
uh left undone from just before the
 
05:25:19.350 --> 05:25:19.360 align:start position:0%
start of the pandemic
 
05:25:21.670 --> 05:25:21.680 align:start position:0%
colleagues i'm here today to introduce
 
05:25:25.430 --> 05:25:25.440 align:start position:0%
house bill 1370 which would establish a
 
05:25:27.670 --> 05:25:27.680 align:start position:0%
committee to study child care options
 
05:25:29.990 --> 05:25:30.000 align:start position:0%
for new hampshire legislators
 
05:25:33.270 --> 05:25:33.280 align:start position:0%
a quick google search surfaced a 2008
 
05:25:33.280 --> 05:25:34.628 align:start position:0%
a quick google search surfaced a 2008
interview

05:25:34.628 --> 05:25:34.638 align:start position:0%
interview
 
05:25:36.150 --> 05:25:36.160 align:start position:0%
in the national conference of state
 
05:25:38.788 --> 05:25:38.798 align:start position:0%
legislatures magazine
 
05:25:40.628 --> 05:25:40.638 align:start position:0%
featuring the oldest and the youngest
 
05:25:42.788 --> 05:25:42.798 align:start position:0%
state legislators in the country
 
05:25:45.190 --> 05:25:45.200 align:start position:0%
perhaps unsurprisingly both were from
 
05:25:46.390 --> 05:25:46.400 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
05:25:48.788 --> 05:25:48.798 align:start position:0%
representative jeff fontes and then he
 
05:25:51.350 --> 05:25:51.360 align:start position:0%
was then 21 years old and representative
 
05:25:52.948 --> 05:25:52.958 align:start position:0%
angie kopka
 
05:25:55.270 --> 05:25:55.280 align:start position:0%
then 92 years young
 
05:25:57.590 --> 05:25:57.600 align:start position:0%
14 years later the new hampshire house
 
05:25:59.350 --> 05:25:59.360 align:start position:0%
may very well continue to be home to the
 
05:26:00.948 --> 05:26:00.958 align:start position:0%
oldest and the youngest legislators in
 
05:26:02.230 --> 05:26:02.240 align:start position:0%
the country
 
05:26:04.788 --> 05:26:04.798 align:start position:0%
according to the house clerk who can
 
05:26:06.230 --> 05:26:06.240 align:start position:0%
correct me
 
05:26:08.310 --> 05:26:08.320 align:start position:0%
if any of this is inaccurate at the
 
05:26:09.548 --> 05:26:09.558 align:start position:0%
start of the
 
05:26:12.070 --> 05:26:12.080 align:start position:0%
2021-2022 biennium the oldest house
 
05:26:15.270 --> 05:26:15.280 align:start position:0%
member was 94 and the youngest was 19.
 
05:26:16.948 --> 05:26:16.958 align:start position:0%
it's an impressive spread between the
 
05:26:18.310 --> 05:26:18.320 align:start position:0%
oldest and youngest
 
05:26:20.070 --> 05:26:20.080 align:start position:0%
and should be a source of pride for our
 
05:26:21.750 --> 05:26:21.760 align:start position:0%
citizen legislature
 
05:26:23.750 --> 05:26:23.760 align:start position:0%
we are consistent on that front and
 
05:26:25.670 --> 05:26:25.680 align:start position:0%
definitely unique among legislative
 
05:26:27.670 --> 05:26:27.680 align:start position:0%
chambers in the united states
 
05:26:30.948 --> 05:26:30.958 align:start position:0%
but it doesn't tell the entire story
 
05:26:32.708 --> 05:26:32.718 align:start position:0%
according to the house clerk with only
 
05:26:35.190 --> 05:26:35.200 align:start position:0%
five members not reporting the average
 
05:26:36.948 --> 05:26:36.958 align:start position:0%
age of the new hampshire house at the
 
05:26:40.230 --> 05:26:40.240 align:start position:0%
start of the biennium was 61 years old
 
05:26:43.190 --> 05:26:43.200 align:start position:0%
that's the same as last term
 
05:26:45.110 --> 05:26:45.120 align:start position:0%
when you break legislator age down
 
05:26:45.120 --> 05:26:46.230 align:start position:0%
when you break legislator age down
further

05:26:46.230 --> 05:26:46.240 align:start position:0%
further
 
05:26:47.910 --> 05:26:47.920 align:start position:0%
the decade
 
05:26:49.910 --> 05:26:49.920 align:start position:0%
with the most members
 
05:26:54.948 --> 05:26:54.958 align:start position:0%
is legislators 60 to 69 years old
 
05:26:57.430 --> 05:26:57.440 align:start position:0%
a total of 78 percent that's nearly 4
 
05:27:00.548 --> 05:27:00.558 align:start position:0%
out of 5 members are over the age of 50.
 
05:27:02.470 --> 05:27:02.480 align:start position:0%
to be very clear
 
05:27:04.390 --> 05:27:04.400 align:start position:0%
i think there is a lot of wisdom and
 
05:27:06.470 --> 05:27:06.480 align:start position:0%
life experience
 
05:27:09.030 --> 05:27:09.040 align:start position:0%
in our chamber i know i've benefited
 
05:27:10.390 --> 05:27:10.400 align:start position:0%
personally and professionally from the
 
05:27:11.910 --> 05:27:11.920 align:start position:0%
guidance and mentorship
 
05:27:13.510 --> 05:27:13.520 align:start position:0%
of our more seasoned house colleagues
 
05:27:15.430 --> 05:27:15.440 align:start position:0%
including some of you here
 
05:27:17.670 --> 05:27:17.680 align:start position:0%
just as i have gained valuable insight
 
05:27:21.590 --> 05:27:21.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:23.510 --> 05:27:23.520 align:start position:0%
but when the median age of our chamber
 
05:27:25.350 --> 05:27:25.360 align:start position:0%
consistently ranks at the very top of
 
05:27:27.190 --> 05:27:27.200 align:start position:0%
the charts nationally
 
05:27:29.590 --> 05:27:29.600 align:start position:0%
i do think it's important for us to be
 
05:27:31.350 --> 05:27:31.360 align:start position:0%
honest about areas where we could do
 
05:27:33.030 --> 05:27:33.040 align:start position:0%
better so that our state citizen
 
05:27:35.350 --> 05:27:35.360 align:start position:0%
legislature lives up to its promise
 
05:27:37.990 --> 05:27:38.000 align:start position:0%
of being truly representative of our
 
05:27:40.310 --> 05:27:40.320 align:start position:0%
state's population
 
05:27:42.548 --> 05:27:42.558 align:start position:0%
when i first visited the state house as
 
05:27:43.830 --> 05:27:43.840 align:start position:0%
a fourth grader
 
05:27:45.590 --> 05:27:45.600 align:start position:0%
i remember looking down from the gallery
 
05:27:47.830 --> 05:27:47.840 align:start position:0%
and thinking to myself i'd like to serve
 
05:27:49.510 --> 05:27:49.520 align:start position:0%
in the new hampshire house when i'm
 
05:27:49.520 --> 05:27:51.190 align:start position:0%
in the new hampshire house when i'm
retired

05:27:51.190 --> 05:27:51.200 align:start position:0%
retired
 
05:27:52.788 --> 05:27:52.798 align:start position:0%
but one of the main reasons that i made
 
05:27:54.470 --> 05:27:54.480 align:start position:0%
the choice to first run for the house in
 
05:27:54.480 --> 05:27:55.750 align:start position:0%
the choice to first run for the house in
2018

05:27:55.750 --> 05:27:55.760 align:start position:0%
2018
 
05:27:58.390 --> 05:27:58.400 align:start position:0%
as a 36 year old with two young children
 
05:27:59.910 --> 05:27:59.920 align:start position:0%
was that i felt like parents of young
 
05:28:02.628 --> 05:28:02.638 align:start position:0%
kids were underrepresented in our state
 
05:28:05.430 --> 05:28:05.440 align:start position:0%
legislature with our 100 annual salary
 
05:28:07.670 --> 05:28:07.680 align:start position:0%
it makes sense
 
05:28:09.670 --> 05:28:09.680 align:start position:0%
i also think about the challenges facing
 
05:28:12.070 --> 05:28:12.080 align:start position:0%
new hampshire families health care
 
05:28:12.080 --> 05:28:13.430 align:start position:0%
new hampshire families health care
education

05:28:13.430 --> 05:28:13.440 align:start position:0%
education
 
05:28:15.430 --> 05:28:15.440 align:start position:0%
housing child care
 
05:28:17.510 --> 05:28:17.520 align:start position:0%
just to name a few
 
05:28:20.310 --> 05:28:20.320 align:start position:0%
i also think about the challenges facing
 
05:28:22.788 --> 05:28:22.798 align:start position:0%
new hampshire employers
 
05:28:25.110 --> 05:28:25.120 align:start position:0%
workforce attraction and retention
 
05:28:27.670 --> 05:28:27.680 align:start position:0%
student debt and again housing
 
05:28:30.150 --> 05:28:30.160 align:start position:0%
education and child care
 
05:28:31.830 --> 05:28:31.840 align:start position:0%
and so for being honest
 
05:28:33.590 --> 05:28:33.600 align:start position:0%
about where our citizen legislature may
 
05:28:35.350 --> 05:28:35.360 align:start position:0%
be falling a bit short
 
05:28:37.190 --> 05:28:37.200 align:start position:0%
i think it's important to acknowledge
 
05:28:39.270 --> 05:28:39.280 align:start position:0%
that a barrier to public service for
 
05:28:41.750 --> 05:28:41.760 align:start position:0%
parents of young children who would make
 
05:28:41.760 --> 05:28:43.750 align:start position:0%
parents of young children who would make
extraordinary

05:28:43.750 --> 05:28:43.760 align:start position:0%
extraordinary
 
05:28:45.830 --> 05:28:45.840 align:start position:0%
legislators is the lack of affordable
 
05:28:47.830 --> 05:28:47.840 align:start position:0%
and dependable child care
 
05:28:50.150 --> 05:28:50.160 align:start position:0%
recognizing some of the challenge that i
 
05:28:51.750 --> 05:28:51.760 align:start position:0%
just outlined
 
05:28:53.110 --> 05:28:53.120 align:start position:0%
facing new hampshire families and
 
05:28:55.670 --> 05:28:55.680 align:start position:0%
employers i believe it would be smart
 
05:28:58.070 --> 05:28:58.080 align:start position:0%
planning and good public policy for us
 
05:28:59.670 --> 05:28:59.680 align:start position:0%
to do something to address this unique
 
05:29:01.910 --> 05:29:01.920 align:start position:0%
barrier to public service in hopes of
 
05:29:04.150 --> 05:29:04.160 align:start position:0%
increasing representation
 
05:29:05.910 --> 05:29:05.920 align:start position:0%
of granite state parents the bulk of
 
05:29:09.910 --> 05:29:09.920 align:start position:0%
whom are in their 20s 30s and 40s whose
 
05:29:11.830 --> 05:29:11.840 align:start position:0%
lived experience is currently
 
05:29:13.110 --> 05:29:13.120 align:start position:0%
underrepresented in the new hampshire
 
05:29:15.190 --> 05:29:15.200 align:start position:0%
house of representatives
 
05:29:17.590 --> 05:29:17.600 align:start position:0%
in 2020 the honorable samantha fox
 
05:29:20.070 --> 05:29:20.080 align:start position:0%
introduced house bill
 
05:29:23.590 --> 05:29:23.600 align:start position:0%
uh 1227 to turn the smoking lounge into
 
05:29:25.270 --> 05:29:25.280 align:start position:0%
a child care lounge
 
05:29:26.868 --> 05:29:26.878 align:start position:0%
and of course the child care piece was
 
05:29:29.030 --> 05:29:29.040 align:start position:0%
somewhat tongue-in-cheek but it served
 
05:29:31.190 --> 05:29:31.200 align:start position:0%
as a vehicle to drive a conversation
 
05:29:32.708 --> 05:29:32.718 align:start position:0%
about the kinds of support that our
 
05:29:35.430 --> 05:29:35.440 align:start position:0%
citizen legislature offers its members
 
05:29:37.750 --> 05:29:37.760 align:start position:0%
in the 21st century
 
05:29:39.110 --> 05:29:39.120 align:start position:0%
but in the days leading up to the
 
05:29:42.070 --> 05:29:42.080 align:start position:0%
committee vote on house bill 1227 the
 
05:29:43.350 --> 05:29:43.360 align:start position:0%
joint committee on legislative
 
05:29:45.590 --> 05:29:45.600 align:start position:0%
facilities closed the smoking lounge
 
05:29:47.750 --> 05:29:47.760 align:start position:0%
instead of recommending the bill itl
 
05:29:50.788 --> 05:29:50.798 align:start position:0%
this committee voted to amend the bill
 
05:29:53.510 --> 05:29:53.520 align:start position:0%
to establish a study committee to look
 
05:29:55.990 --> 05:29:56.000 align:start position:0%
into child care options for lawmakers at
 
05:29:58.150 --> 05:29:58.160 align:start position:0%
the state house which is essentially the
 
05:30:00.310 --> 05:30:00.320 align:start position:0%
legislation before you today in house
 
05:30:02.628 --> 05:30:02.638 align:start position:0%
bill 1370.
 
05:30:05.190 --> 05:30:05.200 align:start position:0%
in the same way that installing the
 
05:30:05.200 --> 05:30:06.548 align:start position:0%
in the same way that installing the
mamava

05:30:06.548 --> 05:30:06.558 align:start position:0%
mamava
 
05:30:08.628 --> 05:30:08.638 align:start position:0%
pod the pod for new mothers to

breastfeed in private in the basement of
 
05:30:12.788 --> 05:30:12.798 align:start position:0%
the legislative office building
 
05:30:14.390 --> 05:30:14.400 align:start position:0%
it's a long overdue step in the right
 
05:30:16.628 --> 05:30:16.638 align:start position:0%
direction towards supporting legislators
 
05:30:18.070 --> 05:30:18.080 align:start position:0%
staff lobbyists and members of the
 
05:30:20.788 --> 05:30:20.798 align:start position:0%
public with babies house bill 1370 is
 
05:30:23.510 --> 05:30:23.520 align:start position:0%
another step in expanding opportunity to
 
05:30:25.270 --> 05:30:25.280 align:start position:0%
the next generation of citizen
 
05:30:25.280 --> 05:30:26.788 align:start position:0%
the next generation of citizen
legislators

05:30:26.788 --> 05:30:26.798 align:start position:0%
legislators
 
05:30:28.788 --> 05:30:28.798 align:start position:0%
on monday we honored the life and legacy
 
05:30:31.350 --> 05:30:31.360 align:start position:0%
of dr martin luther king jr which made
 
05:30:33.670 --> 05:30:33.680 align:start position:0%
me revisit one of my favorite sermons
 
05:30:35.990 --> 05:30:36.000 align:start position:0%
the drum major instinct
 
05:30:38.390 --> 05:30:38.400 align:start position:0%
if you want to be important wonderful if
 
05:30:41.350 --> 05:30:41.360 align:start position:0%
you want to be recognized wonderful
 
05:30:44.070 --> 05:30:44.080 align:start position:0%
if you want to be great wonderful
 
05:30:45.910 --> 05:30:45.920 align:start position:0%
but recognize that he who is greatest
 
05:30:48.070 --> 05:30:48.080 align:start position:0%
among you shall be your servant that's a
 
05:30:50.230 --> 05:30:50.240 align:start position:0%
new definition of greatness by giving
 
05:30:52.150 --> 05:30:52.160 align:start position:0%
that definition of greatness
 
05:30:53.990 --> 05:30:54.000 align:start position:0%
it means that everybody can be great
 
05:30:57.270 --> 05:30:57.280 align:start position:0%
because everyone can serve
 
05:30:59.110 --> 05:30:59.120 align:start position:0%
it goes on a little bit
 
05:31:00.948 --> 05:31:00.958 align:start position:0%
but that last line is the one that i
 
05:31:03.750 --> 05:31:03.760 align:start position:0%
love the most everybody can be great
 
05:31:06.390 --> 05:31:06.400 align:start position:0%
because everybody can serve
 
05:31:08.548 --> 05:31:08.558 align:start position:0%
sadly not everyone can serve in our
 
05:31:12.150 --> 05:31:12.160 align:start position:0%
state's 424-member citizen legislature
 
05:31:13.990 --> 05:31:14.000 align:start position:0%
raising a young child
 
05:31:16.150 --> 05:31:16.160 align:start position:0%
should be a benefit not a barrier to
 
05:31:18.230 --> 05:31:18.240 align:start position:0%
public service in new hampshire
 
05:31:19.750 --> 05:31:19.760 align:start position:0%
our constitutionally mandated
 
05:31:21.430 --> 05:31:21.440 align:start position:0%
legislative salary
 
05:31:23.990 --> 05:31:24.000 align:start position:0%
of one hundred dollars per year forces
 
05:31:25.990 --> 05:31:26.000 align:start position:0%
countless granite staters to pass on the
 
05:31:28.390 --> 05:31:28.400 align:start position:0%
opportunity to run for office
 
05:31:30.628 --> 05:31:30.638 align:start position:0%
for parents with child care needs
 
05:31:32.150 --> 05:31:32.160 align:start position:0%
it can be all that more daunting to
 
05:31:34.310 --> 05:31:34.320 align:start position:0%
figure out how to make it all work
 
05:31:36.548 --> 05:31:36.558 align:start position:0%
as a consequence we miss out on their
 
05:31:39.110 --> 05:31:39.120 align:start position:0%
unique perspective and lived experience
 
05:31:40.788 --> 05:31:40.798 align:start position:0%
on a number of issues critical to new
 
05:31:42.548 --> 05:31:42.558 align:start position:0%
hampshire employers and new hampshire
 
05:31:42.558 --> 05:31:43.990 align:start position:0%

colleagues i urge you to send house bill
 
05:31:48.310 --> 05:31:48.320 align:start position:0%
1370 to the floor with a strong
 
05:31:49.990 --> 05:31:50.000 align:start position:0%
bipartisan recommendation of ought to
 
05:31:50.000 --> 05:31:50.868 align:start position:0%
bipartisan recommendation of ought to
pass

05:31:50.868 --> 05:31:50.878 align:start position:0%
pass
 
05:31:53.110 --> 05:31:53.120 align:start position:0%
so we can begin the important work of
 
05:31:54.708 --> 05:31:54.718 align:start position:0%
better understanding the child care
 
05:31:57.190 --> 05:31:57.200 align:start position:0%
challenges faced by parent legislators
 
05:31:58.708 --> 05:31:58.718 align:start position:0%
and make recommendations to remove
 
05:32:00.708 --> 05:32:00.718 align:start position:0%
barriers to their public service and the
 
05:32:02.310 --> 05:32:02.320 align:start position:0%
service of other parents

whole family to make it work for me to
 
05:32:38.628 --> 05:32:38.638 align:start position:0%

question uh yes
 
05:32:54.470 --> 05:32:54.480 align:start position:0%
uh i would absolutely believe that that
 
05:32:56.390 --> 05:32:56.400 align:start position:0%
is the case and i also believe that
 
05:32:58.230 --> 05:32:58.240 align:start position:0%
you're you're lucky and that you've been
 
05:32:59.590 --> 05:32:59.600 align:start position:0%
able to figure out how to juggle and
 
05:33:01.030 --> 05:33:01.040 align:start position:0%
make it all work and i know it probably
 
05:33:02.868 --> 05:33:02.878 align:start position:0%
looks a little bit different each time
 
05:33:03.990 --> 05:33:04.000 align:start position:0%
you come here
 
05:33:08.070 --> 05:33:08.080 align:start position:0%

05:33:43.190 --> 05:33:43.200 align:start position:0%
question uh i do not have that
 
05:33:45.270 --> 05:33:45.280 align:start position:0%
information um
 
05:33:45.280 --> 05:33:46.150 align:start position:0%
information um
but

05:33:46.150 --> 05:33:46.160 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:33:48.390 --> 05:33:48.400 align:start position:0%
in doing some some research to prepare
 
05:33:50.548 --> 05:33:50.558 align:start position:0%
for this you know i learned a lot in
 
05:33:52.310 --> 05:33:52.320 align:start position:0%
doing some some digging
 
05:33:54.070 --> 05:33:54.080 align:start position:0%
and um
 
05:33:55.510 --> 05:33:55.520 align:start position:0%
i'm happy to look into that a little bit
 
05:33:59.590 --> 05:33:59.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:01.270 --> 05:34:01.280 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
05:34:03.110 --> 05:34:03.120 align:start position:0%
thank you and i yeah definitely
 
05:34:04.788 --> 05:34:04.798 align:start position:0%
understand if you don't know because i i
 
05:34:07.910 --> 05:34:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:10.150 --> 05:34:10.160 align:start position:0%
would you believe that there is probably
 
05:34:11.670 --> 05:34:11.680 align:start position:0%
a discrepancy
 
05:34:13.990 --> 05:34:14.000 align:start position:0%
between the number you know
 
05:34:16.390 --> 05:34:16.400 align:start position:0%
the number of people who serve versus
 
05:34:21.190 --> 05:34:21.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:23.270 --> 05:34:23.280 align:start position:0%
thanks for the follow-up uh i would not
 
05:34:26.548 --> 05:34:26.558 align:start position:0%
be surprised if that was the case
 
05:34:29.670 --> 05:34:29.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:31.190 --> 05:34:31.200 align:start position:0%
i have one
 
05:34:31.200 --> 05:34:32.310 align:start position:0%
i have one
um

05:34:32.310 --> 05:34:32.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:34:34.628 --> 05:34:34.638 align:start position:0%
my question is uh
 
05:34:36.868 --> 05:34:36.878 align:start position:0%
since the last time that we filed this
 
05:34:36.878 --> 05:34:38.310 align:start position:0%
since the last time that we filed this
bill

05:34:38.310 --> 05:34:38.320 align:start position:0%
bill
 
05:34:40.788 --> 05:34:40.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:42.830 --> 05:34:42.840 align:start position:0%
garnered any evidence of
 
05:34:44.788 --> 05:34:44.798 align:start position:0%
underrepresentation due to the lack of
 
05:34:46.548 --> 05:34:46.558 align:start position:0%
child care do you
 
05:34:49.910 --> 05:34:49.920 align:start position:0%
do you think that there are issues that
 
05:34:51.350 --> 05:34:51.360 align:start position:0%
have not been addressed by the
 
05:34:51.360 --> 05:34:53.030 align:start position:0%
have not been addressed by the
legislature

05:34:53.030 --> 05:34:53.040 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
05:34:55.510 --> 05:34:55.520 align:start position:0%
as a result direct result of not having
 
05:34:57.430 --> 05:34:57.440 align:start position:0%
child care
 
05:34:59.350 --> 05:34:59.360 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman for the question
 
05:35:01.350 --> 05:35:01.360 align:start position:0%
i think it's a really good question i
 
05:35:04.070 --> 05:35:04.080 align:start position:0%
think that
 
05:35:07.190 --> 05:35:07.200 align:start position:0%
because of the underrepresentation
 
05:35:07.200 --> 05:35:08.230 align:start position:0%
because of the underrepresentation
of

05:35:08.230 --> 05:35:08.240 align:start position:0%
of
 
05:35:10.708 --> 05:35:10.718 align:start position:0%
folks that are in their late 20s 30s 40s
 
05:35:12.708 --> 05:35:12.718 align:start position:0%
and i think that the data that the
 
05:35:14.628 --> 05:35:14.638 align:start position:0%
clerk's office has has pulled together
 
05:35:15.910 --> 05:35:15.920 align:start position:0%
and pulls together at the beginning of
 
05:35:17.110 --> 05:35:17.120 align:start position:0%
each term
 
05:35:18.868 --> 05:35:18.878 align:start position:0%
i think if you look at
 
05:35:20.868 --> 05:35:20.878 align:start position:0%
how those decades are slightly
 
05:35:20.878 --> 05:35:22.310 align:start position:0%
how those decades are slightly
underrepresented

05:35:22.310 --> 05:35:22.320 align:start position:0%
underrepresented
 
05:35:25.670 --> 05:35:25.680 align:start position:0%
uh and you think about the
 
05:35:25.680 --> 05:35:27.270 align:start position:0%
uh and you think about the
uh

05:35:27.270 --> 05:35:27.280 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:35:30.150 --> 05:35:30.160 align:start position:0%
the pressure then that
 
05:35:32.390 --> 05:35:32.400 align:start position:0%
uh representatives
 
05:35:34.390 --> 05:35:34.400 align:start position:0%
including some of whom are in this room
 
05:35:35.510 --> 05:35:35.520 align:start position:0%
who are
 
05:35:37.510 --> 05:35:37.520 align:start position:0%
doing that work of juggling
 
05:35:39.350 --> 05:35:39.360 align:start position:0%
child care along with
 
05:35:40.628 --> 05:35:40.638 align:start position:0%
working with
 
05:35:42.390 --> 05:35:42.400 align:start position:0%
serving in the legislature i think it
 
05:35:44.230 --> 05:35:44.240 align:start position:0%
puts a lot of pressure on those
 
05:35:45.830 --> 05:35:45.840 align:start position:0%
individuals to
 
05:35:48.230 --> 05:35:48.240 align:start position:0%
fully represent the the challenges that
 
05:35:51.990 --> 05:35:52.000 align:start position:0%
are faced by those folks so i mean i i i
 
05:35:53.990 --> 05:35:54.000 align:start position:0%
think there's anecdotal evidence you
 
05:35:54.948 --> 05:35:54.958 align:start position:0%
know i think there's through
 
05:35:56.788 --> 05:35:56.798 align:start position:0%
conversations that you know i've had
 
05:35:58.708 --> 05:35:58.718 align:start position:0%
with folks um
 
05:36:01.430 --> 05:36:01.440 align:start position:0%
you know this this makes sense to them
 
05:36:02.548 --> 05:36:02.558 align:start position:0%
that we
 
05:36:04.548 --> 05:36:04.558 align:start position:0%
you know pursue developing strategies
 
05:36:06.470 --> 05:36:06.480 align:start position:0%
which could be a combination of public
 
05:36:08.868 --> 05:36:08.878 align:start position:0%
private non-profit options that could be
 
05:36:10.470 --> 05:36:10.480 align:start position:0%
on site here at the state house complex
 
05:36:11.830 --> 05:36:11.840 align:start position:0%
or off-site
 
05:36:11.840 --> 05:36:13.030 align:start position:0%
or off-site
um

05:36:13.030 --> 05:36:13.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:36:15.190 --> 05:36:15.200 align:start position:0%
but i think it's it's worth pursuing so
 
05:36:15.200 --> 05:36:16.948 align:start position:0%
but i think it's it's worth pursuing so
that

05:36:16.948 --> 05:36:16.958 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:36:18.628 --> 05:36:18.638 align:start position:0%
you know those who do raise their hand
 
05:36:20.788 --> 05:36:20.798 align:start position:0%
and say i'm ready and willing to serve
 
05:36:22.788 --> 05:36:22.798 align:start position:0%
who are in this demographic who are
 
05:36:24.230 --> 05:36:24.240 align:start position:0%
raising children don't have the
 
05:36:25.910 --> 05:36:25.920 align:start position:0%
additional burden of
 
05:36:25.920 --> 05:36:26.788 align:start position:0%
additional burden of
uh

05:36:26.788 --> 05:36:26.798 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:36:26.798 --> 05:36:27.830 align:start position:0%
uh
of

05:36:27.830 --> 05:36:27.840 align:start position:0%
of
 
05:36:29.910 --> 05:36:29.920 align:start position:0%
trying to represent the issues faced by
 
05:36:32.470 --> 05:36:32.480 align:start position:0%
working families
 
05:36:34.230 --> 05:36:34.240 align:start position:0%
across the state
 
05:36:37.190 --> 05:36:37.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:41.270 --> 05:36:41.280 align:start position:0%
i guess i have two questions one is
 
05:36:43.750 --> 05:36:43.760 align:start position:0%
comes from my experience serving on on
 
05:36:45.590 --> 05:36:45.600 align:start position:0%
house education
 
05:36:47.990 --> 05:36:48.000 align:start position:0%
where any number of times if i happen to
 
05:36:49.990 --> 05:36:50.000 align:start position:0%
leave the room i would have to step over
 
05:36:51.510 --> 05:36:51.520 align:start position:0%
three or four
 
05:36:51.520 --> 05:36:52.548 align:start position:0%
three or four
um

05:36:52.548 --> 05:36:52.558 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:36:53.830 --> 05:36:53.840 align:start position:0%
i don't even know what they're called
 
05:36:55.910 --> 05:36:55.920 align:start position:0%
anymore child carriers i guess or
 
05:36:58.548 --> 05:36:58.558 align:start position:0%
something like that um
 
05:37:02.230 --> 05:37:02.240 align:start position:0%
so so i guess i'm i'm leaning from the
 
05:37:03.990 --> 05:37:04.000 align:start position:0%
standpoint of
 
05:37:04.000 --> 05:37:05.670 align:start position:0%
standpoint of
um

05:37:05.670 --> 05:37:05.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:37:08.310 --> 05:37:08.320 align:start position:0%
you don't have to be in this place
 
05:37:11.190 --> 05:37:11.200 align:start position:0%
you don't have to be a representative
 
05:37:14.230 --> 05:37:14.240 align:start position:0%
to get representation
 
05:37:16.230 --> 05:37:16.240 align:start position:0%
in fact i've told a couple people that
 
05:37:18.788 --> 05:37:18.798 align:start position:0%
have lost elections i actually think you
 
05:37:21.590 --> 05:37:21.600 align:start position:0%
can be more influential not being in the
 
05:37:23.190 --> 05:37:23.200 align:start position:0%
state house than being in the state
 
05:37:26.470 --> 05:37:26.480 align:start position:0%
house because you can focus on
 
05:37:28.868 --> 05:37:28.878 align:start position:0%
any issue or several issues
 
05:37:30.948 --> 05:37:30.958 align:start position:0%
and not have to deal with
 
05:37:32.390 --> 05:37:32.400 align:start position:0%
other things
 
05:37:34.470 --> 05:37:34.480 align:start position:0%
the other point that i'd like to make is
 
05:37:35.910 --> 05:37:35.920 align:start position:0%
that it
 
05:37:38.628 --> 05:37:38.638 align:start position:0%
it seems
 
05:37:41.270 --> 05:37:41.280 align:start position:0%
a misnomer at least to me
 
05:37:41.280 --> 05:37:42.868 align:start position:0%
a misnomer at least to me
um

05:37:42.868 --> 05:37:42.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:37:44.230 --> 05:37:44.240 align:start position:0%
i that
 
05:37:46.310 --> 05:37:46.320 align:start position:0%
because of my age and
 
05:37:48.070 --> 05:37:48.080 align:start position:0%
early 60s
 
05:37:50.230 --> 05:37:50.240 align:start position:0%
i don't just deal with issues that are
 
05:37:53.030 --> 05:37:53.040 align:start position:0%
relating to 60 year olds
 
05:37:55.030 --> 05:37:55.040 align:start position:0%
i submitted a bill for
 
05:37:55.040 --> 05:37:55.830 align:start position:0%
i submitted a bill for
um

05:37:55.830 --> 05:37:55.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:37:55.840 --> 05:37:57.270 align:start position:0%
um
uh

05:37:57.270 --> 05:37:57.280 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:37:58.788 --> 05:37:58.798 align:start position:0%
people that
 
05:38:00.868 --> 05:38:00.878 align:start position:0%
were unable to to
 
05:38:03.430 --> 05:38:03.440 align:start position:0%
drive standard but were
 
05:38:06.470 --> 05:38:06.480 align:start position:0%
driving alcohol for their older brother
 
05:38:08.868 --> 05:38:08.878 align:start position:0%
or something like that i mean so those
 
05:38:11.430 --> 05:38:11.440 align:start position:0%
are 15 and 16 year olds so i guess i'm
 
05:38:13.110 --> 05:38:13.120 align:start position:0%
i'm saying i don't know
 
05:38:16.390 --> 05:38:16.400 align:start position:0%
if there's a direct connection to
 
05:38:19.030 --> 05:38:19.040 align:start position:0%
the age of the representative and the
 
05:38:21.270 --> 05:38:21.280 align:start position:0%
issues that the representative is is
 
05:38:21.280 --> 05:38:22.390 align:start position:0%
issues that the representative is is
handling

05:38:22.390 --> 05:38:22.400 align:start position:0%
handling
 
05:38:22.400 --> 05:38:23.430 align:start position:0%
handling
so

05:38:23.430 --> 05:38:23.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:38:25.110 --> 05:38:25.120 align:start position:0%
i'm not trying to put this in the
 
05:38:27.670 --> 05:38:27.680 align:start position:0%
category of would you believe i'm trying
 
05:38:29.830 --> 05:38:29.840 align:start position:0%
to say
 
05:38:33.110 --> 05:38:33.120 align:start position:0%
is it necessary in your belief
 
05:38:33.120 --> 05:38:34.150 align:start position:0%
is it necessary in your belief
that

05:38:34.150 --> 05:38:34.160 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:38:36.548 --> 05:38:36.558 align:start position:0%
representation is a direct
 
05:38:39.270 --> 05:38:39.280 align:start position:0%
relation to the age of the of the
 
05:38:39.280 --> 05:38:43.750 align:start position:0%
relation to the age of the of the
representative

05:38:43.750 --> 05:38:43.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:45.990 --> 05:38:46.000 align:start position:0%
uh thank you chairman for a question and
 
05:38:48.868 --> 05:38:48.878 align:start position:0%
i want to try and tackle both of those
 
05:38:50.948 --> 05:38:50.958 align:start position:0%
situations um
 
05:38:52.788 --> 05:38:52.798 align:start position:0%
to answer your
 
05:38:55.110 --> 05:38:55.120 align:start position:0%
i'll start with number two first
 
05:38:56.390 --> 05:38:56.400 align:start position:0%
i think
 
05:38:57.510 --> 05:38:57.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:38:57.520 --> 05:38:59.110 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

05:38:59.110 --> 05:38:59.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:39:01.990 --> 05:39:02.000 align:start position:0%
you know i think the ability to speak to
 
05:39:04.868 --> 05:39:04.878 align:start position:0%
one's lived experience can be incredibly
 
05:39:07.110 --> 05:39:07.120 align:start position:0%
powerful and one of the
 
05:39:08.948 --> 05:39:08.958 align:start position:0%
things that i've benefited the most from
 
05:39:10.788 --> 05:39:10.798 align:start position:0%
while serving in the house
 
05:39:14.788 --> 05:39:14.798 align:start position:0%
is hearing from a diversity of
 
05:39:17.350 --> 05:39:17.360 align:start position:0%
granite stater's experience both in
 
05:39:19.350 --> 05:39:19.360 align:start position:0%
in public testimony you know members of
 
05:39:20.470 --> 05:39:20.480 align:start position:0%
the public
 
05:39:23.030 --> 05:39:23.040 align:start position:0%
and through really thoughtful questions
 
05:39:25.670 --> 05:39:25.680 align:start position:0%
being asked by members of
 
05:39:26.948 --> 05:39:26.958 align:start position:0%
each committee
 
05:39:31.110 --> 05:39:31.120 align:start position:0%
and um i just started buttering us up
 
05:39:33.190 --> 05:39:33.200 align:start position:0%
no but i just i don't want to understate
 
05:39:35.670 --> 05:39:35.680 align:start position:0%
that because i think that the ability to
 
05:39:37.670 --> 05:39:37.680 align:start position:0%
tap into your lived experience can be
 
05:39:39.750 --> 05:39:39.760 align:start position:0%
really helpful and if you just
 
05:39:41.350 --> 05:39:41.360 align:start position:0%
experienced something
 
05:39:44.628 --> 05:39:44.638 align:start position:0%
earlier that day or in a previous month
 
05:39:48.230 --> 05:39:48.240 align:start position:0%
uh in in raising children you know that
 
05:39:50.310 --> 05:39:50.320 align:start position:0%
that can be uh
 
05:39:51.990 --> 05:39:52.000 align:start position:0%
it can be really powerful question or
 
05:39:53.990 --> 05:39:54.000 align:start position:0%
powerful testimony being shared
 
05:39:56.070 --> 05:39:56.080 align:start position:0%
to answer the and not that it was a
 
05:39:58.470 --> 05:39:58.480 align:start position:0%
question but your first point
 
05:40:01.110 --> 05:40:01.120 align:start position:0%
um i would even encourage
 
05:40:03.110 --> 05:40:03.120 align:start position:0%
the committee to consider an amendment
 
05:40:04.868 --> 05:40:04.878 align:start position:0%
to broaden
 
05:40:06.948 --> 05:40:06.958 align:start position:0%
the scope of
 
05:40:10.150 --> 05:40:10.160 align:start position:0%
the bill to be beyond legislators to to
 
05:40:12.390 --> 05:40:12.400 align:start position:0%
also think about members of the public
 
05:40:15.030 --> 05:40:15.040 align:start position:0%
and the challenges that they might face
 
05:40:15.040 --> 05:40:15.990 align:start position:0%
and the challenges that they might face
in

05:40:15.990 --> 05:40:16.000 align:start position:0%
in
 
05:40:18.310 --> 05:40:18.320 align:start position:0%
uh showing up here if they've got
 
05:40:21.030 --> 05:40:21.040 align:start position:0%
children um and and i don't i don't know
 
05:40:22.310 --> 05:40:22.320 align:start position:0%
what it looks like what i'm not going to
 
05:40:24.230 --> 05:40:24.240 align:start position:0%
do is pretend that i know what the
 
05:40:26.390 --> 05:40:26.400 align:start position:0%
outcomes or what the recommendations
 
05:40:30.070 --> 05:40:30.080 align:start position:0%
of this study committee uh would be
 
05:40:33.750 --> 05:40:33.760 align:start position:0%
however i do know that uh traveling to
 
05:40:33.760 --> 05:40:34.868 align:start position:0%
however i do know that uh traveling to
concord

05:40:34.868 --> 05:40:34.878 align:start position:0%
concord
 
05:40:34.878 --> 05:40:36.070 align:start position:0%
concord
uh

05:40:36.070 --> 05:40:36.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:40:38.070 --> 05:40:38.080 align:start position:0%
you know outside of work and child care
 
05:40:39.030 --> 05:40:39.040 align:start position:0%
and other
 
05:40:40.948 --> 05:40:40.958 align:start position:0%
other factors can be can be challenging
 
05:40:42.868 --> 05:40:42.878 align:start position:0%
for some folks i'm lucky i live 20
 
05:40:44.708 --> 05:40:44.718 align:start position:0%
minutes down the road but i know some
 
05:40:46.948 --> 05:40:46.958 align:start position:0%
other people have to make arrangements
 
05:40:48.230 --> 05:40:48.240 align:start position:0%
you know
 
05:40:50.150 --> 05:40:50.160 align:start position:0%
a week or two in advance so that it
 
05:40:51.830 --> 05:40:51.840 align:start position:0%
aligns with the work schedule whatever
 
05:40:53.350 --> 05:40:53.360 align:start position:0%
we can be doing to remove bears because
 
05:40:55.510 --> 05:40:55.520 align:start position:0%
i think that what exists here in the new
 
05:40:57.830 --> 05:40:57.840 align:start position:0%
hampshire house is just so powerful
 
05:40:59.350 --> 05:40:59.360 align:start position:0%
where every
 
05:41:01.190 --> 05:41:01.200 align:start position:0%
every you know representative can
 
05:41:02.868 --> 05:41:02.878 align:start position:0%
introduce as much legislation as they
 
05:41:02.878 --> 05:41:03.670 align:start position:0%
introduce as much legislation as they
want

05:41:03.670 --> 05:41:03.680 align:start position:0%
want
 
05:41:05.590 --> 05:41:05.600 align:start position:0%
every bill gets a public hearing every
 
05:41:07.270 --> 05:41:07.280 align:start position:0%
bill gets a vote i mean
 
05:41:08.708 --> 05:41:08.718 align:start position:0%
our legislative administration you know
 
05:41:11.030 --> 05:41:11.040 align:start position:0%
how it works
 
05:41:13.270 --> 05:41:13.280 align:start position:0%
but whatever we can do to encourage more
 
05:41:15.030 --> 05:41:15.040 align:start position:0%
members of the public to participate in
 
05:41:16.390 --> 05:41:16.400 align:start position:0%
that process i think is a really
 
05:41:21.190 --> 05:41:21.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:23.750 --> 05:41:23.760 align:start position:0%
one one by representative one last
 
05:41:25.590 --> 05:41:25.600 align:start position:0%
question it's an easy one i i you don't
 
05:41:28.230 --> 05:41:28.240 align:start position:0%
have to think too much
 
05:41:31.510 --> 05:41:31.520 align:start position:0%
this uh requires a finding and a report
 
05:41:34.548 --> 05:41:34.558 align:start position:0%
by november 1st 2022 is that also the
 
05:41:35.910 --> 05:41:35.920 align:start position:0%

welcome thank you mr chair my new
 
05:42:25.830 --> 05:42:25.840 align:start position:0%

05:42:31.990 --> 05:42:32.000 align:start position:0%
i want to start
 
05:42:33.830 --> 05:42:33.840 align:start position:0%
uh introducing this built for the record
 
05:42:35.030 --> 05:42:35.040 align:start position:0%
my name is ellen reed i represent
 
05:42:37.350 --> 05:42:37.360 align:start position:0%
rockingham 17 new market in newfields i
 
05:42:39.510 --> 05:42:39.520 align:start position:0%
wanted to start by talking about
 
05:42:41.350 --> 05:42:41.360 align:start position:0%
how proud we are of having a citizen
 
05:42:43.830 --> 05:42:43.840 align:start position:0%
legislature and i honestly cannot do
 
05:42:46.150 --> 05:42:46.160 align:start position:0%
nearly as good a job as representative
 
05:42:49.190 --> 05:42:49.200 align:start position:0%
wilhelm did he was very eloquent in the
 
05:42:51.830 --> 05:42:51.840 align:start position:0%
importance of a citizen legislature and
 
05:42:54.230 --> 05:42:54.240 align:start position:0%
what that means and and to reference the
 
05:42:56.708 --> 05:42:56.718 align:start position:0%
question that the chair asked him
 
05:42:56.718 --> 05:42:57.750 align:start position:0%
question that the chair asked him
about

05:42:57.750 --> 05:42:57.760 align:start position:0%
about
 
05:43:00.310 --> 05:43:00.320 align:start position:0%
well does someone need to be able to be
 
05:43:03.030 --> 05:43:03.040 align:start position:0%
a legislator in order to be represented
 
05:43:04.628 --> 05:43:04.638 align:start position:0%
and what does it mean because we deal
 
05:43:06.948 --> 05:43:06.958 align:start position:0%
with all kinds of issues here
 
05:43:06.958 --> 05:43:07.910 align:start position:0%
with all kinds of issues here
um

05:43:07.910 --> 05:43:07.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:43:10.708 --> 05:43:10.718 align:start position:0%
my answer to that and this of course has
 
05:43:13.350 --> 05:43:13.360 align:start position:0%
to do with the topic of this bill
 
05:43:16.788 --> 05:43:16.798 align:start position:0%
is no you you may personally not be able
 
05:43:19.110 --> 05:43:19.120 align:start position:0%
or even interested in in
 
05:43:20.868 --> 05:43:20.878 align:start position:0%
becoming a representative in order to be
 
05:43:22.628 --> 05:43:22.638 align:start position:0%
represented that's why it's why we have
 
05:43:23.830 --> 05:43:23.840 align:start position:0%
a republic it's why we have a
 
05:43:25.750 --> 05:43:25.760 align:start position:0%
representative democracy but what's
 
05:43:27.750 --> 05:43:27.760 align:start position:0%
important is that someone who
 
05:43:30.788 --> 05:43:30.798 align:start position:0%
understands your issues is able to get
 
05:43:33.030 --> 05:43:33.040 align:start position:0%
represented and if no one who
 
05:43:35.270 --> 05:43:35.280 align:start position:0%
understands your issues is able to even
 
05:43:37.750 --> 05:43:37.760 align:start position:0%
be be a representative that's where you
 
05:43:41.190 --> 05:43:41.200 align:start position:0%
do not have a citizen legislature
 
05:43:43.030 --> 05:43:43.040 align:start position:0%
for example i serve on fish and game a
 
05:43:46.310 --> 05:43:46.320 align:start position:0%
certain percentage of this house hunts
 
05:43:49.430 --> 05:43:49.440 align:start position:0%
fishes understands those issues
 
05:43:51.270 --> 05:43:51.280 align:start position:0%
a certain percentage that
 
05:43:52.788 --> 05:43:52.798 align:start position:0%
hopefully looks something like the
 
05:43:55.590 --> 05:43:55.600 align:start position:0%
general public right
 
05:43:57.430 --> 05:43:57.440 align:start position:0%
and in terms of being able to vote on
 
05:43:58.868 --> 05:43:58.878 align:start position:0%
all the issues that are before us and
 
05:44:00.230 --> 05:44:00.240 align:start position:0%
yes all the issues they're before us
 
05:44:01.350 --> 05:44:01.360 align:start position:0%
there's a
 
05:44:03.030 --> 05:44:03.040 align:start position:0%
panoply of issues before us that affect
 
05:44:04.548 --> 05:44:04.558 align:start position:0%
a whole bunch of different people but
 
05:44:06.390 --> 05:44:06.400 align:start position:0%
it's not that we take up those issues
 
05:44:09.030 --> 05:44:09.040 align:start position:0%
it's how we understand those issues and
 
05:44:12.390 --> 05:44:12.400 align:start position:0%
if we do not understand the average
 
05:44:14.470 --> 05:44:14.480 align:start position:0%
experience of the regular citizen out
 
05:44:16.628 --> 05:44:16.638 align:start position:0%
there if we don't have certain parts of
 
05:44:19.430 --> 05:44:19.440 align:start position:0%
those that knowledge that experience
 
05:44:20.868 --> 05:44:20.878 align:start position:0%
then we cannot be that citizen
 
05:44:22.628 --> 05:44:22.638 align:start position:0%
legislature because we cannot accurately
 
05:44:24.548 --> 05:44:24.558 align:start position:0%
vote on those issues it's not what do we
 
05:44:26.070 --> 05:44:26.080 align:start position:0%
take up it's how do we understand and
 
05:44:27.750 --> 05:44:27.760 align:start position:0%
how do we vote
 
05:44:29.590 --> 05:44:29.600 align:start position:0%
so we are very proud of the citizen
 
05:44:29.600 --> 05:44:32.390 align:start position:0%
so we are very proud of the citizen
legislature

05:44:32.390 --> 05:44:32.400 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
05:44:35.030 --> 05:44:35.040 align:start position:0%
and we want citizens regular citizens to
 
05:44:36.788 --> 05:44:36.798 align:start position:0%
be here and and
 
05:44:38.788 --> 05:44:38.798 align:start position:0%
we talk a lot about it but
 
05:44:42.948 --> 05:44:42.958 align:start position:0%
we get paid 100 a year 200 per term and
 
05:44:44.548 --> 05:44:44.558 align:start position:0%
this has had an impact on the
 
05:44:44.558 --> 05:44:45.990 align:start position:0%
this has had an impact on the
citizenness

05:44:45.990 --> 05:44:46.000 align:start position:0%
citizenness
 
05:44:48.548 --> 05:44:48.558 align:start position:0%
of our legislature because what we've
 
05:44:49.990 --> 05:44:50.000 align:start position:0%
ended up doing
 
05:44:51.670 --> 05:44:51.680 align:start position:0%
is excluding
 
05:44:55.030 --> 05:44:55.040 align:start position:0%
a huge portion a majority in fact of the
 
05:44:57.910 --> 05:44:57.920 align:start position:0%
citizenry from being able to run and
 
05:45:00.390 --> 05:45:00.400 align:start position:0%
that portion all have one experience in
 
05:45:03.270 --> 05:45:03.280 align:start position:0%
common which is they cannot afford
 
05:45:04.948 --> 05:45:04.958 align:start position:0%
to run for office
 
05:45:06.708 --> 05:45:06.718 align:start position:0%
so all the working class people out
 
05:45:09.510 --> 05:45:09.520 align:start position:0%
there who have to work to pay the bills
 
05:45:12.230 --> 05:45:12.240 align:start position:0%
they are this this method of getting
 
05:45:14.628 --> 05:45:14.638 align:start position:0%
represented is shut down to them
 
05:45:16.390 --> 05:45:16.400 align:start position:0%
now yes the people here have already
 
05:45:18.310 --> 05:45:18.320 align:start position:0%
worked in the past and and have those
 
05:45:20.070 --> 05:45:20.080 align:start position:0%
but i'm talking about the experience
 
05:45:22.390 --> 05:45:22.400 align:start position:0%
right now today these years the year
 
05:45:25.110 --> 05:45:25.120 align:start position:0%
2022 what it's like to be a working
 
05:45:27.590 --> 05:45:27.600 align:start position:0%
person in new hampshire and we have very
 
05:45:29.750 --> 05:45:29.760 align:start position:0%
few people who are able to do that who
 
05:45:31.830 --> 05:45:31.840 align:start position:0%
are able to run and represent that
 
05:45:31.840 --> 05:45:33.510 align:start position:0%
are able to run and represent that
understanding

05:45:33.510 --> 05:45:33.520 align:start position:0%
understanding
 
05:45:35.990 --> 05:45:36.000 align:start position:0%
i put it like this if i were to come to
 
05:45:38.390 --> 05:45:38.400 align:start position:0%
new hampshire and start a business and i
 
05:45:40.708 --> 05:45:40.718 align:start position:0%
want to hire 400 of the best and
 
05:45:42.470 --> 05:45:42.480 align:start position:0%
brightest and most capable people in
 
05:45:43.910 --> 05:45:43.920 align:start position:0%
this state and i say i can pay you a
 
05:45:46.390 --> 05:45:46.400 align:start position:0%
competitive wage i would have a huge
 
05:45:47.830 --> 05:45:47.840 align:start position:0%
pool of options
 
05:45:50.628 --> 05:45:50.638 align:start position:0%
a huge pool of applicants to choose from
 
05:45:51.830 --> 05:45:51.840 align:start position:0%
and i could choose the best and
 
05:45:51.840 --> 05:45:53.030 align:start position:0%
and i could choose the best and
brightest

05:45:53.030 --> 05:45:53.040 align:start position:0%
brightest
 
05:45:55.670 --> 05:45:55.680 align:start position:0%
but if i come to a state and say i want
 
05:45:57.670 --> 05:45:57.680 align:start position:0%
to start this awesome business i need to
 
05:45:59.830 --> 05:45:59.840 align:start position:0%
hire 400 of the best and brightest and i
 
05:46:02.470 --> 05:46:02.480 align:start position:0%
can pay you 100 a year all of a sudden
 
05:46:04.070 --> 05:46:04.080 align:start position:0%
that applicant pool has gotten really
 
05:46:06.310 --> 05:46:06.320 align:start position:0%
really small and i may not be able to
 
05:46:07.990 --> 05:46:08.000 align:start position:0%
find people who are the best and
 
05:46:09.750 --> 05:46:09.760 align:start position:0%
brightest and can really do the job the
 
05:46:13.750 --> 05:46:13.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:16.070 --> 05:46:16.080 align:start position:0%
and the effect that that has had is like
 
05:46:18.948 --> 05:46:18.958 align:start position:0%
i said is it it's not representative in
 
05:46:20.390 --> 05:46:20.400 align:start position:0%
it's not just not representative in the
 
05:46:22.310 --> 05:46:22.320 align:start position:0%
experience but then you see that play
 
05:46:24.548 --> 05:46:24.558 align:start position:0%
out in other ways for example
 
05:46:26.070 --> 05:46:26.080 align:start position:0%
um as of a couple of years ago the
 
05:46:27.990 --> 05:46:28.000 align:start position:0%
average age of the the legislative body
 
05:46:30.788 --> 05:46:30.798 align:start position:0%
is 66 the average age of the state is
 
05:46:34.788 --> 05:46:34.798 align:start position:0%
43. it's just a different experience
 
05:46:36.708 --> 05:46:36.718 align:start position:0%
there are other ways in which this body
 
05:46:38.708 --> 05:46:38.718 align:start position:0%
looks different but let me bring you to
 
05:46:41.750 --> 05:46:41.760 align:start position:0%
the original intent of that 200
 
05:46:44.830 --> 05:46:44.840 align:start position:0%
that 200 that's in the
 
05:46:48.350 --> 05:46:48.360 align:start position:0%
constitution that was put in 1784. in
 
05:46:48.360 --> 05:46:50.070 align:start position:0%
constitution that was put in 1784. in
1784

05:46:50.070 --> 05:46:50.080 align:start position:0%
1784
 
05:46:53.030 --> 05:46:53.040 align:start position:0%
the cost of one acre of improved land
 
05:46:55.350 --> 05:46:55.360 align:start position:0%
having a structure built on it at one
 
05:46:58.390 --> 05:46:58.400 align:start position:0%
acre was thirty dollars
 
05:47:00.948 --> 05:47:00.958 align:start position:0%
thirty dollars is all it took to buy one
 
05:47:03.190 --> 05:47:03.200 align:start position:0%
acre of improved land
 
05:47:04.788 --> 05:47:04.798 align:start position:0%
you could take that two hundred dollars
 
05:47:08.310 --> 05:47:08.320 align:start position:0%
and buy a six acre uh six acre farm most
 
05:47:09.910 --> 05:47:09.920 align:start position:0%
people were farmers
 
05:47:11.030 --> 05:47:11.040 align:start position:0%
or you could
 
05:47:12.548 --> 05:47:12.558 align:start position:0%
live off that two hundred dollars but
 
05:47:14.390 --> 05:47:14.400 align:start position:0%
the point is the intent of the
 
05:47:15.910 --> 05:47:15.920 align:start position:0%
legislature the intent of the
 
05:47:17.670 --> 05:47:17.680 align:start position:0%
constitution the people who framed the
 
05:47:19.990 --> 05:47:20.000 align:start position:0%
new hampshire constitution was to in
 
05:47:20.000 --> 05:47:20.868 align:start position:0%
new hampshire constitution was to in
fact

05:47:20.868 --> 05:47:20.878 align:start position:0%
fact
 
05:47:23.190 --> 05:47:23.200 align:start position:0%
as the bible says pay the worker the
 
05:47:25.590 --> 05:47:25.600 align:start position:0%
worker is worth his wages pay us enough
 
05:47:27.830 --> 05:47:27.840 align:start position:0%
not an exorbitant amount not an opulent
 
05:47:27.840 --> 05:47:28.708 align:start position:0%
not an exorbitant amount not an opulent
amount

05:47:28.708 --> 05:47:28.718 align:start position:0%
amount
 
05:47:30.708 --> 05:47:30.718 align:start position:0%
but a livable amount
 
05:47:32.948 --> 05:47:32.958 align:start position:0%
to pay us for our time that we spend
 
05:47:37.030 --> 05:47:37.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:38.948 --> 05:47:38.958 align:start position:0%
so as you know it's in the constitution
 
05:47:40.150 --> 05:47:40.160 align:start position:0%
and it's in the constitution the
 
05:47:42.868 --> 05:47:42.878 align:start position:0%
compensation will be in full 200 per
 
05:47:42.878 --> 05:47:44.948 align:start position:0%
compensation will be in full 200 per
biennium

05:47:44.948 --> 05:47:44.958 align:start position:0%
biennium
 
05:47:46.948 --> 05:47:46.958 align:start position:0%
and this was put in the constitution
 
05:47:48.070 --> 05:47:48.080 align:start position:0%
before there was widespread
 
05:47:50.548 --> 05:47:50.558 align:start position:0%
understanding of inflation so
 
05:47:52.628 --> 05:47:52.638 align:start position:0%
i think it's fairly obvious that the
 
05:47:55.190 --> 05:47:55.200 align:start position:0%
people who put this in didn't understand
 
05:47:58.868 --> 05:47:58.878 align:start position:0%
that an acre of improved land in 2022
 
05:48:01.910 --> 05:48:01.920 align:start position:0%
would certainly not be thirty dollars
 
05:48:03.910 --> 05:48:03.920 align:start position:0%
in fact i don't think you can get it for
 
05:48:05.270 --> 05:48:05.280 align:start position:0%
you probably pay more like three hundred
 
05:48:07.350 --> 05:48:07.360 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars for an acre with with a
 
05:48:09.590 --> 05:48:09.600 align:start position:0%
house on it right
 
05:48:12.390 --> 05:48:12.400 align:start position:0%
so because that phrase in full it means
 
05:48:14.070 --> 05:48:14.080 align:start position:0%
we either need a constitutional amend
 
05:48:15.830 --> 05:48:15.840 align:start position:0%
well we need a constitutional amendment
 
05:48:18.230 --> 05:48:18.240 align:start position:0%
we can't even put in legislation that
 
05:48:20.470 --> 05:48:20.480 align:start position:0%
says okay we'll pay you the 200 but then
 
05:48:22.310 --> 05:48:22.320 align:start position:0%
there's an additional amount that we can
 
05:48:24.868 --> 05:48:24.878 align:start position:0%
adjust as the years go by for what makes
 
05:48:26.868 --> 05:48:26.878 align:start position:0%
sense we can't do that because of that
 
05:48:30.310 --> 05:48:30.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:32.230 --> 05:48:32.240 align:start position:0%
so some people have suggested in order
 
05:48:32.240 --> 05:48:33.350 align:start position:0%
so some people have suggested in order
to

05:48:33.350 --> 05:48:33.360 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:48:36.470 --> 05:48:36.480 align:start position:0%
afford i guess payment or compensation
 
05:48:38.708 --> 05:48:38.718 align:start position:0%
and change constitution that we have a
 
05:48:40.948 --> 05:48:40.958 align:start position:0%
smaller body and i absolutely disagree
 
05:48:43.350 --> 05:48:43.360 align:start position:0%
with that i think that is the key to
 
05:48:45.030 --> 05:48:45.040 align:start position:0%
citizen legislature the fact that i
 
05:48:48.628 --> 05:48:48.638 align:start position:0%
represent only 3 400 people
 
05:48:49.990 --> 05:48:50.000 align:start position:0%
there was previous discussion on the
 
05:48:52.868 --> 05:48:52.878 align:start position:0%
previous bill about how
 
05:48:55.830 --> 05:48:55.840 align:start position:0%
we many of us have to work multiple jobs
 
05:48:57.830 --> 05:48:57.840 align:start position:0%
or try to make ends meet to make this
 
05:49:00.470 --> 05:49:00.480 align:start position:0%
job work out i at any given time i'm
 
05:49:02.310 --> 05:49:02.320 align:start position:0%
working several of
 
05:49:04.548 --> 05:49:04.558 align:start position:0%
four jobs i balance four different jobs
 
05:49:06.948 --> 05:49:06.958 align:start position:0%
in order to make this one work
 
05:49:09.830 --> 05:49:09.840 align:start position:0%
i teach adjunct american government at a
 
05:49:11.830 --> 05:49:11.840 align:start position:0%
community college i also drive for
 
05:49:13.670 --> 05:49:13.680 align:start position:0%
boston duck tours
 
05:49:15.430 --> 05:49:15.440 align:start position:0%
so i i
 
05:49:17.670 --> 05:49:17.680 align:start position:0%
i talk a lot about the ideas of
 
05:49:19.270 --> 05:49:19.280 align:start position:0%
constitution and government and good
 
05:49:19.280 --> 05:49:20.628 align:start position:0%
constitution and government and good
governance

05:49:20.628 --> 05:49:20.638 align:start position:0%
governance
 
05:49:23.830 --> 05:49:23.840 align:start position:0%
but we balance these jobs
 
05:49:26.230 --> 05:49:26.240 align:start position:0%
but that means that i'm accessible i'm
 
05:49:27.830 --> 05:49:27.840 align:start position:0%
in the workforce i'm talking to people
 
05:49:29.590 --> 05:49:29.600 align:start position:0%
every day i'm driving when i used to
 
05:49:31.350 --> 05:49:31.360 align:start position:0%
drive for public transit i have people
 
05:49:33.430 --> 05:49:33.440 align:start position:0%
getting on my bus i hear the things they
 
05:49:34.708 --> 05:49:34.718 align:start position:0%
say about their jobs and their
 
05:49:37.750 --> 05:49:37.760 align:start position:0%
experiences i am accessible
 
05:49:39.910 --> 05:49:39.920 align:start position:0%
that is citizen legislature
 
05:49:41.350 --> 05:49:41.360 align:start position:0%
right that's not
 
05:49:43.430 --> 05:49:43.440 align:start position:0%
you work for free because if you work
 
05:49:45.110 --> 05:49:45.120 align:start position:0%
for free all that means is the only
 
05:49:46.470 --> 05:49:46.480 align:start position:0%
people who can run are the people who
 
05:49:48.788 --> 05:49:48.798 align:start position:0%
don't need the money that's not
 
05:49:50.708 --> 05:49:50.718 align:start position:0%
representative but being out in the
 
05:49:52.628 --> 05:49:52.638 align:start position:0%
public being accessible that is the
 
05:49:56.310 --> 05:49:56.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:58.788 --> 05:49:58.798 align:start position:0%
but i want to kind of focus on the idea
 
05:50:00.548 --> 05:50:00.558 align:start position:0%
of compensation because the thing is is
 
05:50:03.310 --> 05:50:03.320 align:start position:0%
we don't need compensation we don't need
 
05:50:05.670 --> 05:50:05.680 align:start position:0%
compensation it says compensation in
 
05:50:08.150 --> 05:50:08.160 align:start position:0%
full in order to overcome this problem
 
05:50:10.628 --> 05:50:10.638 align:start position:0%
of we don't have a representative body
 
05:50:12.948 --> 05:50:12.958 align:start position:0%
what we need is to enable the part of
 
05:50:15.670 --> 05:50:15.680 align:start position:0%
the the citizenry that doesn't have
 
05:50:18.230 --> 05:50:18.240 align:start position:0%
access to run we need to enable them to
 
05:50:18.240 --> 05:50:19.190 align:start position:0%
access to run we need to enable them to
run

05:50:19.190 --> 05:50:19.200 align:start position:0%
run
 
05:50:21.110 --> 05:50:21.120 align:start position:0%
so rather than try to adjust the
 
05:50:23.270 --> 05:50:23.280 align:start position:0%
compensation by a constitutional
 
05:50:26.070 --> 05:50:26.080 align:start position:0%
amendment or an unconstitutional
 
05:50:29.110 --> 05:50:29.120 align:start position:0%
increase in our compensation
 
05:50:32.390 --> 05:50:32.400 align:start position:0%
i have before you this bill
 
05:50:35.430 --> 05:50:35.440 align:start position:0%
so how this works is this is a financial
 
05:50:38.230 --> 05:50:38.240 align:start position:0%
assistance program that you qualify for
 
05:50:40.788 --> 05:50:40.798 align:start position:0%
by being both low income and serving for
 
05:50:43.110 --> 05:50:43.120 align:start position:0%
one year in the legislature
 
05:50:44.390 --> 05:50:44.400 align:start position:0%
that is how you qualify for this
 
05:50:47.190 --> 05:50:47.200 align:start position:0%
financial assistance program
 
05:50:49.590 --> 05:50:49.600 align:start position:0%
it works by saying whatever the previous
 
05:50:52.310 --> 05:50:52.320 align:start position:0%
year's uh average household income in
 
05:50:54.548 --> 05:50:54.558 align:start position:0%
new hampshire was for any person who
 
05:50:57.030 --> 05:50:57.040 align:start position:0%
served that year that full year if your
 
05:50:58.788 --> 05:50:58.798 align:start position:0%
household income and it's important it's
 
05:51:02.390 --> 05:51:02.400 align:start position:0%
household is underneath that average
 
05:51:04.470 --> 05:51:04.480 align:start position:0%
you will qualify for a stipend the
 
05:51:06.948 --> 05:51:06.958 align:start position:0%
amount of the stipend is either the
 
05:51:08.948 --> 05:51:08.958 align:start position:0%
difference between your household income
 
05:51:11.110 --> 05:51:11.120 align:start position:0%
and the average or a quarter of the
 
05:51:13.190 --> 05:51:13.200 align:start position:0%
average whichever is less
 
05:51:15.350 --> 05:51:15.360 align:start position:0%
so for example if the average income in
 
05:51:17.110 --> 05:51:17.120 align:start position:0%
new hampshire for the household and the
 
05:51:19.190 --> 05:51:19.200 align:start position:0%
reason it's important it's household is
 
05:51:21.030 --> 05:51:21.040 align:start position:0%
i don't want to
 
05:51:23.510 --> 05:51:23.520 align:start position:0%
pay you know an 18 year old who's living
 
05:51:25.430 --> 05:51:25.440 align:start position:0%
off their parents right their parents
 
05:51:27.110 --> 05:51:27.120 align:start position:0%
are doing well that's not the point of
 
05:51:29.590 --> 05:51:29.600 align:start position:0%
this or you know
 
05:51:30.948 --> 05:51:30.958 align:start position:0%
someone who's staying at home while
 
05:51:33.030 --> 05:51:33.040 align:start position:0%
their their spouse is is doing quite
 
05:51:33.040 --> 05:51:33.910 align:start position:0%
their their spouse is is doing quite
well

05:51:33.910 --> 05:51:33.920 align:start position:0%
well
 
05:51:35.510 --> 05:51:35.520 align:start position:0%
that's not the point the point is to
 
05:51:39.110 --> 05:51:39.120 align:start position:0%
enable people who can't otherwise come
 
05:51:40.230 --> 05:51:40.240 align:start position:0%
so that's why it's important it's
 
05:51:42.230 --> 05:51:42.240 align:start position:0%
household it's also important it's based
 
05:51:43.670 --> 05:51:43.680 align:start position:0%
on the previous years so that we're not
 
05:51:45.510 --> 05:51:45.520 align:start position:0%
projecting what estimates of what
 
05:51:47.190 --> 05:51:47.200 align:start position:0%
someone might make in the future years
 
05:51:48.628 --> 05:51:48.638 align:start position:0%
so this requires that they have served
 
05:51:50.070 --> 05:51:50.080 align:start position:0%
the year and it's based on the previous
 
05:51:51.990 --> 05:51:52.000 align:start position:0%
year but i digress how it work i
 
05:51:54.150 --> 05:51:54.160 align:start position:0%
explained how it works so for example if
 
05:51:55.590 --> 05:51:55.600 align:start position:0%
the average household income in new
 
05:51:57.990 --> 05:51:58.000 align:start position:0%
hampshire is sixty thousand and your
 
05:52:00.070 --> 05:52:00.080 align:start position:0%
household as a legislator made forty
 
05:52:01.990 --> 05:52:02.000 align:start position:0%
thousand the difference is twenty
 
05:52:04.548 --> 05:52:04.558 align:start position:0%
thousand but a quarter of sixty is
 
05:52:06.230 --> 05:52:06.240 align:start position:0%
fifteen so you would get fifteen
 
05:52:09.430 --> 05:52:09.440 align:start position:0%
thousand because 15 is less than 20. 15
 
05:52:11.030 --> 05:52:11.040 align:start position:0%
in that case would be the maximum anyone
 
05:52:13.510 --> 05:52:13.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:13.520 --> 05:52:15.030 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:52:15.030 --> 05:52:15.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:52:16.868 --> 05:52:16.878 align:start position:0%
so the whole point is for the body to
 
05:52:18.788 --> 05:52:18.798 align:start position:0%
become a representative slice and if
 
05:52:20.868 --> 05:52:20.878 align:start position:0%
that is successful if this were to be
 
05:52:22.628 --> 05:52:22.638 align:start position:0%
implemented and became successful and
 
05:52:22.638 --> 05:52:23.750 align:start position:0%
implemented and became successful and
truly

05:52:23.750 --> 05:52:23.760 align:start position:0%
truly
 
05:52:27.190 --> 05:52:27.200 align:start position:0%
this body started to represent or look
 
05:52:29.830 --> 05:52:29.840 align:start position:0%
like in terms of ability in terms of you
 
05:52:29.840 --> 05:52:30.628 align:start position:0%
like in terms of ability in terms of you
know

05:52:30.628 --> 05:52:30.638 align:start position:0%
know
 
05:52:32.310 --> 05:52:32.320 align:start position:0%
your life and how you deal with work and
 
05:52:34.470 --> 05:52:34.480 align:start position:0%
everything if we actually got to that
 
05:52:37.750 --> 05:52:37.760 align:start position:0%
kind of parody then you would see
 
05:52:39.830 --> 05:52:39.840 align:start position:0%
the income distribution in the house
 
05:52:42.788 --> 05:52:42.798 align:start position:0%
mirror what it is in new hampshire and
 
05:52:44.788 --> 05:52:44.798 align:start position:0%
based on that see i the fi the fiscal
 
05:52:46.628 --> 05:52:46.638 align:start position:0%
note was indeterminate because they said
 
05:52:47.910 --> 05:52:47.920 align:start position:0%
they couldn't
 
05:52:47.920 --> 05:52:49.030 align:start position:0%
they couldn't
predict

05:52:49.030 --> 05:52:49.040 align:start position:0%
predict
 
05:52:51.350 --> 05:52:51.360 align:start position:0%
who would in the in the legislature
 
05:52:53.670 --> 05:52:53.680 align:start position:0%
would qualify but i'm saying if we get
 
05:52:55.510 --> 05:52:55.520 align:start position:0%
to that parity we can predict because it
 
05:52:57.350 --> 05:52:57.360 align:start position:0%
would look just like
 
05:52:58.708 --> 05:52:58.718 align:start position:0%
the public
 
05:53:01.670 --> 05:53:01.680 align:start position:0%
and so based on that and based on um
 
05:53:03.830 --> 05:53:03.840 align:start position:0%
the percentiles that i got off of
 
05:53:06.230 --> 05:53:06.240 align:start position:0%
statistic atlas actually on the
 
05:53:07.990 --> 05:53:08.000 align:start position:0%
different household incomes in new
 
05:53:09.430 --> 05:53:09.440 align:start position:0%
hampshire and it's just an estimate i've
 
05:53:11.270 --> 05:53:11.280 align:start position:0%
actually i'm coming up with my own
 
05:53:13.750 --> 05:53:13.760 align:start position:0%
fiscal note for this which it's not
 
05:53:16.628 --> 05:53:16.638 align:start position:0%
cheap right but based on if
 
05:53:18.548 --> 05:53:18.558 align:start position:0%
we look like the rest of the public in
 
05:53:19.830 --> 05:53:19.840 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
05:53:22.948 --> 05:53:22.958 align:start position:0%
you would have 212 senate and body
 
05:53:25.590 --> 05:53:25.600 align:start position:0%
seven in-house you would have 212 people
 
05:53:28.628 --> 05:53:28.638 align:start position:0%
who apply for some level of
 
05:53:30.868 --> 05:53:30.878 align:start position:0%
of stipend some of those stipends would
 
05:53:33.590 --> 05:53:33.600 align:start position:0%
be quite small like a thousand dollars
 
05:53:36.150 --> 05:53:36.160 align:start position:0%
and based on those really rough um
 
05:53:37.830 --> 05:53:37.840 align:start position:0%
income brackets
 
05:53:39.830 --> 05:53:39.840 align:start position:0%
the total would be about two to three
 
05:53:41.990 --> 05:53:42.000 align:start position:0%
million dollars a year so
 
05:53:44.070 --> 05:53:44.080 align:start position:0%
not cheap not big in the grand scheme of
 
05:53:46.868 --> 05:53:46.878 align:start position:0%
things but not cheap but i felt like i
 
05:53:47.910 --> 05:53:47.920 align:start position:0%
should let you know that because they
 
05:53:49.510 --> 05:53:49.520 align:start position:0%
didn't do their job and coming up with a
 
05:53:49.520 --> 05:53:50.548 align:start position:0%
didn't do their job and coming up with a
number

05:53:50.548 --> 05:53:50.558 align:start position:0%
number
 
05:53:51.750 --> 05:53:51.760 align:start position:0%
i didn't mean they didn't do their job
 
05:53:53.510 --> 05:53:53.520 align:start position:0%
but you know what i'm saying i feel like
 
05:53:55.990 --> 05:53:56.000 align:start position:0%
we can sort of sort of give an estimate
 
05:53:58.150 --> 05:53:58.160 align:start position:0%
that's a worst case scenario maybe we
 
05:54:00.390 --> 05:54:00.400 align:start position:0%
never get to parody i don't know
 
05:54:00.400 --> 05:54:01.190 align:start position:0%
never get to parody i don't know
but

05:54:01.190 --> 05:54:01.200 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:54:03.590 --> 05:54:03.600 align:start position:0%
more to the point like in my
 
05:54:03.600 --> 05:54:04.788 align:start position:0%
more to the point like in my
company

05:54:04.788 --> 05:54:04.798 align:start position:0%
company
 
05:54:07.030 --> 05:54:07.040 align:start position:0%
analogy that i gave
 
05:54:09.750 --> 05:54:09.760 align:start position:0%
this i can understand people's reticence
 
05:54:12.150 --> 05:54:12.160 align:start position:0%
in in supporting this as legislators
 
05:54:13.750 --> 05:54:13.760 align:start position:0%
because what this means ultimately is
 
05:54:15.510 --> 05:54:15.520 align:start position:0%
you're going to have more competition
 
05:54:17.430 --> 05:54:17.440 align:start position:0%
people who cannot run for office would
 
05:54:20.150 --> 05:54:20.160 align:start position:0%
be enabled to run for office and that
 
05:54:21.990 --> 05:54:22.000 align:start position:0%
kind of sucks is sitting legislators
 
05:54:25.350 --> 05:54:25.360 align:start position:0%
right like that kind of not the best
 
05:54:27.110 --> 05:54:27.120 align:start position:0%
you'll have more competition but that's
 
05:54:28.948 --> 05:54:28.958 align:start position:0%
how it's supposed to work
 
05:54:30.548 --> 05:54:30.558 align:start position:0%
that's how we're supposed to operate
 
05:54:30.558 --> 05:54:32.390 align:start position:0%
that's how we're supposed to operate
democracy

05:54:32.390 --> 05:54:32.400 align:start position:0%
democracy
 
05:54:32.400 --> 05:54:33.430 align:start position:0%
democracy
so

05:54:33.430 --> 05:54:33.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:54:35.110 --> 05:54:35.120 align:start position:0%
i guess with that i'm happy to take
 
05:54:37.430 --> 05:54:37.440 align:start position:0%
questions that's the the points that i
 
05:54:39.590 --> 05:54:39.600 align:start position:0%
have to make i know that you know i put
 
05:54:41.830 --> 05:54:41.840 align:start position:0%
this in knowing that there would be a
 
05:54:44.070 --> 05:54:44.080 align:start position:0%
push back but i felt like i needed to
 
05:54:45.430 --> 05:54:45.440 align:start position:0%
say those things
 
05:54:45.440 --> 05:54:46.310 align:start position:0%
say those things
great

05:54:46.310 --> 05:54:46.320 align:start position:0%
great
 
05:54:48.070 --> 05:54:48.080 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your testimony
 
05:54:49.990 --> 05:54:50.000 align:start position:0%
and i applaud you for actually making
 
05:54:51.590 --> 05:54:51.600 align:start position:0%
your own fiscal note
 
05:54:55.670 --> 05:54:55.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:57.110 --> 05:54:57.120 align:start position:0%
i uh
 
05:54:59.830 --> 05:54:59.840 align:start position:0%
you are willing to take questions i'm
 
05:55:02.948 --> 05:55:02.958 align:start position:0%
looking at representative expedia
 
05:55:04.230 --> 05:55:04.240 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you
 
05:55:06.230 --> 05:55:06.240 align:start position:0%
representative reed for uh their
 
05:55:09.190 --> 05:55:09.200 align:start position:0%
testimony do you think you know
 
05:55:11.350 --> 05:55:11.360 align:start position:0%
do you think this would help in
 
05:55:13.750 --> 05:55:13.760 align:start position:0%
also helping you know
 
05:55:16.150 --> 05:55:16.160 align:start position:0%
get help helping the new hampshire house
 
05:55:18.310 --> 05:55:18.320 align:start position:0%
become much more and
 
05:55:22.628 --> 05:55:22.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:25.750 --> 05:55:25.760 align:start position:0%
so diverse in terms of sex and race and
 
05:55:29.510 --> 05:55:29.520 align:start position:0%
things like that i do because um the
 
05:55:30.868 --> 05:55:30.878 align:start position:0%
percentages and these are just
 
05:55:33.910 --> 05:55:33.920 align:start position:0%
statistics that women on average make
 
05:55:36.470 --> 05:55:36.480 align:start position:0%
less money than men uh most racial
 
05:55:38.548 --> 05:55:38.558 align:start position:0%
minorities on average make less money
 
05:55:41.910 --> 05:55:41.920 align:start position:0%
than whites we are as a body
 
05:55:44.548 --> 05:55:44.558 align:start position:0%
and i apologize in advance but we are
 
05:55:45.990 --> 05:55:46.000 align:start position:0%
wider and
 
05:55:47.350 --> 05:55:47.360 align:start position:0%
more male
 
05:55:49.270 --> 05:55:49.280 align:start position:0%
as well as older than the general
 
05:55:53.110 --> 05:55:53.120 align:start position:0%
population if we uh if we really looked
 
05:55:55.510 --> 05:55:55.520 align:start position:0%
like the population in terms of race
 
05:55:57.190 --> 05:55:57.200 align:start position:0%
then you would have about 20
 
05:55:59.750 --> 05:55:59.760 align:start position:0%
representatives who were people of color
 
05:56:02.948 --> 05:56:02.958 align:start position:0%
and we don't have anywhere near that um
 
05:56:05.110 --> 05:56:05.120 align:start position:0%
that's five percent of the population
 
05:56:06.628 --> 05:56:06.638 align:start position:0%
five percent of the body
 
05:56:06.638 --> 05:56:07.590 align:start position:0%
five percent of the body
but

05:56:07.590 --> 05:56:07.600 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:56:09.590 --> 05:56:09.600 align:start position:0%
um naturally
 
05:56:11.510 --> 05:56:11.520 align:start position:0%
so this is not and also of course parody
 
05:56:13.510 --> 05:56:13.520 align:start position:0%
for women we we'd have half the body and
 
05:56:15.270 --> 05:56:15.280 align:start position:0%
i'm still hoping for that regardless of
 
05:56:17.750 --> 05:56:17.760 align:start position:0%
the outcome of this bill but
 
05:56:19.670 --> 05:56:19.680 align:start position:0%
um the point here is this is obviously
 
05:56:21.670 --> 05:56:21.680 align:start position:0%
not directed at race or sex or anything
 
05:56:23.830 --> 05:56:23.840 align:start position:0%
else i think you would naturally get
 
05:56:25.750 --> 05:56:25.760 align:start position:0%
parody in all of those other categories
 
05:56:29.190 --> 05:56:29.200 align:start position:0%
whatever they are if you enable everyone
 
05:56:32.070 --> 05:56:32.080 align:start position:0%
to uh to serve if they have the skills
 
05:56:37.590 --> 05:56:37.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:37.600 --> 05:56:39.750 align:start position:0%
 
good

05:56:39.750 --> 05:56:39.760 align:start position:0%
good
 
05:56:39.760 --> 05:56:42.708 align:start position:0%
good
yes

05:56:42.708 --> 05:56:42.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:44.310 --> 05:56:44.320 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for your
 
05:56:46.708 --> 05:56:46.718 align:start position:0%
testimony today representative
 
05:56:48.628 --> 05:56:48.638 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering with the department of
 
05:56:50.788 --> 05:56:50.798 align:start position:0%
health and human services
 
05:56:53.110 --> 05:56:53.120 align:start position:0%
who establishes the programs for
 
05:56:55.590 --> 05:56:55.600 align:start position:0%
something like this is it done by the
 
05:56:57.190 --> 05:56:57.200 align:start position:0%
federal government or does new hampshire
 
05:56:59.270 --> 05:56:59.280 align:start position:0%
have the right to do it on their own new
 
05:57:00.708 --> 05:57:00.718 align:start position:0%
hampshire has their own department of
 
05:57:02.070 --> 05:57:02.080 align:start position:0%
health and human services in fact
 
05:57:04.230 --> 05:57:04.240 align:start position:0%
they're here to testify that this would
 
05:57:05.430 --> 05:57:05.440 align:start position:0%
be a lot of work for them and they would
 
05:57:08.628 --> 05:57:08.638 align:start position:0%
really like you not to do this
 
05:57:08.638 --> 05:57:09.350 align:start position:0%
really like you not to do this
so

05:57:09.350 --> 05:57:09.360 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:57:11.750 --> 05:57:11.760 align:start position:0%
and i understand that
 
05:57:14.230 --> 05:57:14.240 align:start position:0%
and i've actually worked with
 
05:57:17.270 --> 05:57:17.280 align:start position:0%
the the official who's here today on
 
05:57:18.708 --> 05:57:18.718 align:start position:0%
other bills in the past and he's lovely
 
05:57:20.390 --> 05:57:20.400 align:start position:0%
to work with so i won't take it
 
05:57:22.470 --> 05:57:22.480 align:start position:0%
personally but now we have the ability
 
05:57:24.788 --> 05:57:24.798 align:start position:0%
in my understanding to to establish this
 
05:57:26.390 --> 05:57:26.400 align:start position:0%
through our own department and they
 
05:57:27.590 --> 05:57:27.600 align:start position:0%
would run it
 
05:57:29.910 --> 05:57:29.920 align:start position:0%
much the way that they run everything
 
05:57:32.310 --> 05:57:32.320 align:start position:0%
else i will say that i do understand it
 
05:57:34.548 --> 05:57:34.558 align:start position:0%
is extra work and everything we do here
 
05:57:35.910 --> 05:57:35.920 align:start position:0%
means extra work for a department
 
05:57:38.708 --> 05:57:38.718 align:start position:0%
somewhere um but this would be 212
 
05:57:42.070 --> 05:57:42.080 align:start position:0%
applications so it is if we reach that
 
05:57:49.030 --> 05:57:49.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:52.150 --> 05:57:52.160 align:start position:0%
uh yes representative simon sorry
 
05:57:53.270 --> 05:57:53.280 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you
 
05:57:55.590 --> 05:57:55.600 align:start position:0%
representative um
 
05:57:55.600 --> 05:57:56.948 align:start position:0%
representative um
so

05:57:56.948 --> 05:57:56.958 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:57:58.548 --> 05:57:58.558 align:start position:0%
not just yourself i feel like i've heard
 
05:58:00.948 --> 05:58:00.958 align:start position:0%
it insinuated a few times um so i think
 
05:58:02.310 --> 05:58:02.320 align:start position:0%
it's probably an important question a
 
05:58:04.070 --> 05:58:04.080 align:start position:0%
pertinent question to ask
 
05:58:07.590 --> 05:58:07.600 align:start position:0%
at this juncture um
 
05:58:09.270 --> 05:58:09.280 align:start position:0%
well let me rephrase rephrase the way
 
05:58:11.670 --> 05:58:11.680 align:start position:0%
that i was going to say it
 
05:58:13.670 --> 05:58:13.680 align:start position:0%
one of the arguments that you made was
 
05:58:15.590 --> 05:58:15.600 align:start position:0%
that people are unable to participate
 
05:58:17.190 --> 05:58:17.200 align:start position:0%
because they have a lot of other
 
05:58:19.350 --> 05:58:19.360 align:start position:0%
responsibilities that make them a part
 
05:58:21.270 --> 05:58:21.280 align:start position:0%
of the community so for example yourself
 
05:58:24.310 --> 05:58:24.320 align:start position:0%
you work duct tours and you um you know
 
05:58:25.910 --> 05:58:25.920 align:start position:0%
teach adjunct and you're in those
 
05:58:27.830 --> 05:58:27.840 align:start position:0%
positions because you're trying to make
 
05:58:29.510 --> 05:58:29.520 align:start position:0%
this job work
 
05:58:30.628 --> 05:58:30.638 align:start position:0%
if we were
 
05:58:33.590 --> 05:58:33.600 align:start position:0%
to find a way to pay you more money
 
05:58:34.948 --> 05:58:34.958 align:start position:0%
would that that
 
05:58:37.030 --> 05:58:37.040 align:start position:0%
allow you i feel like the assumption is
 
05:58:38.788 --> 05:58:38.798 align:start position:0%
that would allow you to not do those
 
05:58:40.708 --> 05:58:40.718 align:start position:0%
other things so that you could focus
 
05:58:42.948 --> 05:58:42.958 align:start position:0%
more here so would that then take you
 
05:58:44.788 --> 05:58:44.798 align:start position:0%
out of the realm of rubbing elbows with
 
05:58:46.548 --> 05:58:46.558 align:start position:0%
all of those people and make you less of
 
05:58:47.590 --> 05:58:47.600 align:start position:0%
a citizen
 
05:58:47.600 --> 05:58:48.948 align:start position:0%
a citizen
legislator

05:58:48.948 --> 05:58:48.958 align:start position:0%
legislator
 
05:58:52.310 --> 05:58:52.320 align:start position:0%
well only if i mean so no i don't i
 
05:58:53.910 --> 05:58:53.920 align:start position:0%
don't believe that because first of all
 
05:58:55.430 --> 05:58:55.440 align:start position:0%
seventeen thousand as
 
05:58:57.030 --> 05:58:57.040 align:start position:0%
based on the current median household
 
05:58:58.628 --> 05:58:58.638 align:start position:0%
median in new hampshire
 
05:58:59.990 --> 05:59:00.000 align:start position:0%
the maximum i could get would be
 
05:59:01.510 --> 05:59:01.520 align:start position:0%
seventeen thousand a year so that
 
05:59:03.750 --> 05:59:03.760 align:start position:0%
definitely does not put me in the i'm
 
05:59:05.510 --> 05:59:05.520 align:start position:0%
independently well off and don't have to
 
05:59:08.310 --> 05:59:08.320 align:start position:0%
work another job category so i'm still
 
05:59:08.320 --> 05:59:09.430 align:start position:0%
work another job category so i'm still
working

05:59:09.430 --> 05:59:09.440 align:start position:0%
working
 
05:59:11.430 --> 05:59:11.440 align:start position:0%
and all my jobs are seasonal duct tours
 
05:59:13.510 --> 05:59:13.520 align:start position:0%
teaching all of that so i'm i'm trying
 
05:59:15.510 --> 05:59:15.520 align:start position:0%
to do things you know to make this
 
05:59:17.430 --> 05:59:17.440 align:start position:0%
particular work so i'm always working
 
05:59:19.910 --> 05:59:19.920 align:start position:0%
but i would say the people currently who
 
05:59:21.670 --> 05:59:21.680 align:start position:0%
are not out there working by that
 
05:59:23.910 --> 05:59:23.920 align:start position:0%
argument that you use are also not in
 
05:59:25.430 --> 05:59:25.440 align:start position:0%
touch with the legislative with the
 
05:59:27.750 --> 05:59:27.760 align:start position:0%
people so
 
05:59:32.788 --> 05:59:32.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:35.990 --> 05:59:36.000 align:start position:0%
so take my my position for example i i
 
05:59:38.390 --> 05:59:38.400 align:start position:0%
own a business i i work
 
05:59:40.548 --> 05:59:40.558 align:start position:0%
at least 60 hours a week as well as
 
05:59:42.390 --> 05:59:42.400 align:start position:0%
doing my work here i have children i
 
05:59:43.590 --> 05:59:43.600 align:start position:0%
have a wife
 
05:59:43.600 --> 05:59:46.470 align:start position:0%
have a wife
um

05:59:46.470 --> 05:59:46.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:48.868 --> 05:59:48.878 align:start position:0%
and i have enough money presently i
 
05:59:50.470 --> 05:59:50.480 align:start position:0%
haven't always but i have enough money
 
05:59:52.788 --> 05:59:52.798 align:start position:0%
presently to be able to support myself
 
05:59:52.798 --> 05:59:54.868 align:start position:0%
presently to be able to support myself
um

05:59:54.868 --> 05:59:54.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:59:57.030 --> 05:59:57.040 align:start position:0%
but i'm still having to do all of that
 
06:00:00.470 --> 06:00:00.480 align:start position:0%
work outside of here and be able to make
 
06:00:00.480 --> 06:00:01.910 align:start position:0%
work outside of here and be able to make
time

06:00:01.910 --> 06:00:01.920 align:start position:0%
time
 
06:00:03.510 --> 06:00:03.520 align:start position:0%
so what's the difference in that
 
06:00:06.230 --> 06:00:06.240 align:start position:0%
scenario between me say and and somebody
 
06:00:07.910 --> 06:00:07.920 align:start position:0%
who finds themselves in a situation like
 
06:00:09.990 --> 06:00:10.000 align:start position:0%
yours for example once again i guess the
 
06:00:11.750 --> 06:00:11.760 align:start position:0%
point that i'm trying to drive out a
 
06:00:12.628 --> 06:00:12.638 align:start position:0%
little bit
 
06:00:12.638 --> 06:00:13.990 align:start position:0%
little bit
is

06:00:13.990 --> 06:00:14.000 align:start position:0%
is
 
06:00:16.708 --> 06:00:16.718 align:start position:0%
if you were to make more money
 
06:00:20.070 --> 06:00:20.080 align:start position:0%
and that doesn't alleviate your
 
06:00:22.230 --> 06:00:22.240 align:start position:0%
needs to be a part of these other things
 
06:00:23.750 --> 06:00:23.760 align:start position:0%
what have we accomplished in making your
 
06:00:25.350 --> 06:00:25.360 align:start position:0%
life easier other than just getting you
 
06:00:27.350 --> 06:00:27.360 align:start position:0%
more money oh sorry i
 
06:00:29.590 --> 06:00:29.600 align:start position:0%
yeah i think i see where you're going so
 
06:00:31.670 --> 06:00:31.680 align:start position:0%
it's it's not just simply the money it's
 
06:00:35.590 --> 06:00:35.600 align:start position:0%
the it's the money spent for those hours
 
06:00:37.670 --> 06:00:37.680 align:start position:0%
right so if i'm working a nine to five
 
06:00:39.670 --> 06:00:39.680 align:start position:0%
if i am a normal nine-to-five worker i
 
06:00:42.230 --> 06:00:42.240 align:start position:0%
cannot do this job everything we do
 
06:00:43.910 --> 06:00:43.920 align:start position:0%
happens on a weekday in between the
 
06:00:45.510 --> 06:00:45.520 align:start position:0%
hours of basically in between the hours
 
06:00:48.548 --> 06:00:48.558 align:start position:0%
of nine to five it takes people who have
 
06:00:51.430 --> 06:00:51.440 align:start position:0%
kind of creative or different or unusual
 
06:00:53.270 --> 06:00:53.280 align:start position:0%
sources of income to be able to make
 
06:00:55.030 --> 06:00:55.040 align:start position:0%
that work and yes sometimes at 60 hours
 
06:00:57.910 --> 06:00:57.920 align:start position:0%
sometimes it's nothing but they can make
 
06:01:00.070 --> 06:01:00.080 align:start position:0%
it work like i have all this kind of
 
06:01:02.548 --> 06:01:02.558 align:start position:0%
little patchwork of of
 
06:01:05.510 --> 06:01:05.520 align:start position:0%
seasonal part-time jobs you have your
 
06:01:07.430 --> 06:01:07.440 align:start position:0%
own business so you can move your hours
 
06:01:10.070 --> 06:01:10.080 align:start position:0%
around when you have to be here um other
 
06:01:12.548 --> 06:01:12.558 align:start position:0%
people have other creative solutions
 
06:01:14.708 --> 06:01:14.718 align:start position:0%
but the point is it's the hours
 
06:01:16.470 --> 06:01:16.480 align:start position:0%
and if you are a nine-to-five worker
 
06:01:18.948 --> 06:01:18.958 align:start position:0%
like most people a lot of working-class
 
06:01:18.958 --> 06:01:19.910 align:start position:0%
like most people a lot of working-class
people

06:01:19.910 --> 06:01:19.920 align:start position:0%
people
 
06:01:23.990 --> 06:01:24.000 align:start position:0%
then you cannot spend those hours here
 
06:01:26.310 --> 06:01:26.320 align:start position:0%
one more
 
06:01:28.390 --> 06:01:28.400 align:start position:0%
so to that point though
 
06:01:30.788 --> 06:01:30.798 align:start position:0%
would this bill allow a person who's
 
06:01:32.548 --> 06:01:32.558 align:start position:0%
working a nine to five
 
06:01:34.788 --> 06:01:34.798 align:start position:0%
to give up their nine to five to be here
 
06:01:35.910 --> 06:01:35.920 align:start position:0%
in your estimation that's what you're
 
06:01:37.110 --> 06:01:37.120 align:start position:0%
saying it would allow them to give up
 
06:01:39.590 --> 06:01:39.600 align:start position:0%
the nine to five because they would be
 
06:01:39.600 --> 06:01:40.708 align:start position:0%
the nine to five because they would be
making

06:01:40.708 --> 06:01:40.718 align:start position:0%
making
 
06:01:43.830 --> 06:01:43.840 align:start position:0%
less than 17 000 now or
 
06:01:46.470 --> 06:01:46.480 align:start position:0%
they can live on 17 000. this is
 
06:01:47.830 --> 06:01:47.840 align:start position:0%
just trying to be clear yeah no it
 
06:01:49.670 --> 06:01:49.680 align:start position:0%
allows them to go part-time okay
 
06:01:51.990 --> 06:01:52.000 align:start position:0%
part-time okay thank you
 
06:01:52.000 --> 06:01:53.830 align:start position:0%
part-time okay thank you
okay

06:01:53.830 --> 06:01:53.840 align:start position:0%
okay
 
06:01:57.510 --> 06:01:57.520 align:start position:0%
um one quick question um
 
06:02:00.628 --> 06:02:00.638 align:start position:0%
what happens to those that are
 
06:02:00.638 --> 06:02:02.150 align:start position:0%
what happens to those that are
generating

06:02:02.150 --> 06:02:02.160 align:start position:0%
generating
 
06:02:04.470 --> 06:02:04.480 align:start position:0%
their livelihood or their income
 
06:02:04.480 --> 06:02:05.990 align:start position:0%
their livelihood or their income
by

06:02:05.990 --> 06:02:06.000 align:start position:0%
by
 
06:02:08.830 --> 06:02:08.840 align:start position:0%
municipal bonds or non-taxable
 
06:02:11.590 --> 06:02:11.600 align:start position:0%
income i i guess i don't what are you
 
06:02:13.030 --> 06:02:13.040 align:start position:0%
saying that doesn't fall under the
 
06:02:16.310 --> 06:02:16.320 align:start position:0%
category of of their income right
 
06:02:18.470 --> 06:02:18.480 align:start position:0%
i i
 
06:02:18.480 --> 06:02:19.910 align:start position:0%
i i
i

06:02:19.910 --> 06:02:19.920 align:start position:0%
i
 
06:02:21.510 --> 06:02:21.520 align:start position:0%
don't think i think it does fall under
 
06:02:21.520 --> 06:02:22.948 align:start position:0%
don't think i think it does fall under
the

06:02:22.948 --> 06:02:22.958 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:02:24.708 --> 06:02:24.718 align:start position:0%
have to ask category why do you think
 
06:02:26.628 --> 06:02:26.638 align:start position:0%
that is an income
 
06:02:26.638 --> 06:02:27.510 align:start position:0%
that is an income
um

06:02:27.510 --> 06:02:27.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:02:29.910 --> 06:02:29.920 align:start position:0%
because it's non-taxable income so there
 
06:02:32.230 --> 06:02:32.240 align:start position:0%
there may be represent if there are let
 
06:02:33.990 --> 06:02:34.000 align:start position:0%
me put it this way if there are
 
06:02:34.000 --> 06:02:35.510 align:start position:0%
me put it this way if there are
representatives

06:02:35.510 --> 06:02:35.520 align:start position:0%
representatives
 
06:02:35.520 --> 06:02:36.628 align:start position:0%
representatives
that

06:02:36.628 --> 06:02:36.638 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:02:39.750 --> 06:02:39.760 align:start position:0%
would qualify for
 
06:02:39.760 --> 06:02:42.708 align:start position:0%
would qualify for
this

06:02:42.708 --> 06:02:42.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:42.718 --> 06:02:44.628 align:start position:0%
 
financially

06:02:44.628 --> 06:02:44.638 align:start position:0%
financially
 
06:02:47.270 --> 06:02:47.280 align:start position:0%
only because of the the
 
06:02:50.830 --> 06:02:50.840 align:start position:0%
portfolio that they've put together
 
06:02:54.390 --> 06:02:54.400 align:start position:0%
um wouldn't that be a problem i guess i
 
06:02:56.868 --> 06:02:56.878 align:start position:0%
don't see where it stipulates it has to
 
06:02:59.030 --> 06:02:59.040 align:start position:0%
be taxable income
 
06:03:01.030 --> 06:03:01.040 align:start position:0%
um certainly if you put that on your
 
06:03:03.110 --> 06:03:03.120 align:start position:0%
your income taxes and say this is
 
06:03:06.070 --> 06:03:06.080 align:start position:0%
non-taxable income it's included in your
 
06:03:08.628 --> 06:03:08.638 align:start position:0%
total income but it's not taxed right
 
06:03:11.350 --> 06:03:11.360 align:start position:0%
it's it's not the portion that's taxed i
 
06:03:13.190 --> 06:03:13.200 align:start position:0%
just wondered if you had thought of it
 
06:03:15.190 --> 06:03:15.200 align:start position:0%
no i i honestly you're correct i haven't
 
06:03:17.030 --> 06:03:17.040 align:start position:0%
i had not thought of that particular
 
06:03:18.948 --> 06:03:18.958 align:start position:0%
problem but if you're in support of the
 
06:03:20.788 --> 06:03:20.798 align:start position:0%
concept i'm happy to put a clarifying
 
06:03:22.868 --> 06:03:22.878 align:start position:0%
amendment in
 
06:03:25.110 --> 06:03:25.120 align:start position:0%
i just wondered if there was a thought
 
06:03:28.948 --> 06:03:28.958 align:start position:0%
towards those that have the ability to
 
06:03:31.510 --> 06:03:31.520 align:start position:0%
do things with their income
 
06:03:32.830 --> 06:03:32.840 align:start position:0%
along the way i
 
06:03:36.070 --> 06:03:36.080 align:start position:0%
absolutely uh do not want this to be
 
06:03:38.628 --> 06:03:38.638 align:start position:0%
abused by people who have uh independent
 
06:03:42.628 --> 06:03:42.638 align:start position:0%
ability to for living expenses thank you
 
06:03:43.990 --> 06:03:44.000 align:start position:0%
all set
 
06:03:48.470 --> 06:03:48.480 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:51.830 --> 06:03:51.840 align:start position:0%
no other pink cards on this bill
 
06:03:56.310 --> 06:03:56.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:00.708 --> 06:04:00.718 align:start position:0%
i thought um i thought this was just
 
06:04:02.390 --> 06:04:02.400 align:start position:0%
in case they were
 
06:04:05.270 --> 06:04:05.280 align:start position:0%
um providing information okay
 
06:04:08.948 --> 06:04:08.958 align:start position:0%
um yep speaking nuts not in support or
 
06:04:11.270 --> 06:04:11.280 align:start position:0%
opposing but providing information so i
 
06:04:13.510 --> 06:04:13.520 align:start position:0%
thought you were just here if we needed
 
06:04:13.520 --> 06:04:14.230 align:start position:0%
thought you were just here if we needed
you

06:04:14.230 --> 06:04:14.240 align:start position:0%

06:04:26.788 --> 06:04:26.798 align:start position:0%

services uh and i was expecting with me
 
06:04:30.868 --> 06:04:30.878 align:start position:0%

06:04:42.548 --> 06:04:42.558 align:start position:0%
representative reed she does a great job
 
06:04:44.390 --> 06:04:44.400 align:start position:0%
i'd love to go on one of her duck boat
 
06:04:46.390 --> 06:04:46.400 align:start position:0%
tours she's certainly i think we're all
 
06:04:48.470 --> 06:04:48.480 align:start position:0%
signing up for that yeah and the fact
 
06:04:50.788 --> 06:04:50.798 align:start position:0%
that she could distill my ethics problem
 
06:04:52.948 --> 06:04:52.958 align:start position:0%
now though i think we've got so this is
 
06:04:54.548 --> 06:04:54.558 align:start position:0%
the problem
 
06:04:56.150 --> 06:04:56.160 align:start position:0%
and the fact that you could distill my
 
06:04:57.990 --> 06:04:58.000 align:start position:0%
my commentary to the committee down to
 
06:04:59.990 --> 06:05:00.000 align:start position:0%
two sentences i i applaud that that was
 
06:05:02.230 --> 06:05:02.240 align:start position:0%
wonderful so with that said we actually
 
06:05:04.628 --> 06:05:04.638 align:start position:0%
did a very thorough financial analysis
 
06:05:06.628 --> 06:05:06.638 align:start position:0%
and one of the things that did obviously
 
06:05:08.470 --> 06:05:08.480 align:start position:0%
not make its way into the bill which we
 
06:05:11.030 --> 06:05:11.040 align:start position:0%
identified as part of our review was
 
06:05:13.350 --> 06:05:13.360 align:start position:0%
that the average household income by the
 
06:05:15.110 --> 06:05:15.120 align:start position:0%
u.s census bureau we went directly to
 
06:05:16.230 --> 06:05:16.240 align:start position:0%
the census bureau to get this
 
06:05:19.670 --> 06:05:19.680 align:start position:0%
information from 2019 was 70 of the
 
06:05:21.910 --> 06:05:21.920 align:start position:0%
average or rather the medium average
 
06:05:24.548 --> 06:05:24.558 align:start position:0%
medium household income in new hampshire
 
06:05:27.110 --> 06:05:27.120 align:start position:0%
is 77 thousand nine hundred thirty three
 
06:05:28.948 --> 06:05:28.958 align:start position:0%
dollars so around seventy eight thousand
 
06:05:30.948 --> 06:05:30.958 align:start position:0%
dollars so i think that would be helpful
 
06:05:33.030 --> 06:05:33.040 align:start position:0%
in looking at the calculations
 
06:05:35.430 --> 06:05:35.440 align:start position:0%
when we said that it was indeterminable
 
06:05:37.270 --> 06:05:37.280 align:start position:0%
we have no knowledge i know uh like
 
06:05:39.430 --> 06:05:39.440 align:start position:0%
myself i'm required to file a 15a
 
06:05:39.440 --> 06:05:40.390 align:start position:0%
myself i'm required to file a 15a
disclosure

06:05:40.390 --> 06:05:40.400 align:start position:0%
disclosure
 
06:05:41.990 --> 06:05:42.000 align:start position:0%
with the secretary of state's office i
 
06:05:43.910 --> 06:05:43.920 align:start position:0%
know the legislature also has a similar
 
06:05:46.070 --> 06:05:46.080 align:start position:0%
requirement to filing that as well but
 
06:05:48.070 --> 06:05:48.080 align:start position:0%
it doesn't give us a basis of what you
 
06:05:50.470 --> 06:05:50.480 align:start position:0%
actually make in terms of your income so
 
06:05:52.390 --> 06:05:52.400 align:start position:0%
for us to say it's indeterminable i have
 
06:05:53.990 --> 06:05:54.000 align:start position:0%
no idea as i'm looking at each of you in
 
06:05:55.830 --> 06:05:55.840 align:start position:0%
this room i am i'm hoping you all do
 
06:05:57.670 --> 06:05:57.680 align:start position:0%
well but i have no idea what you
 
06:05:59.270 --> 06:05:59.280 align:start position:0%
actually make in terms of she does
 
06:06:01.030 --> 06:06:01.040 align:start position:0%
really well
 
06:06:02.948 --> 06:06:02.958 align:start position:0%
those attorney types tend to do that yes
 
06:06:05.910 --> 06:06:05.920 align:start position:0%
they do so um as part of our financial
 
06:06:08.470 --> 06:06:08.480 align:start position:0%
analysis we it is true that this bill
 
06:06:11.030 --> 06:06:11.040 align:start position:0%
provides no appropriation whatsoever and
 
06:06:12.948 --> 06:06:12.958 align:start position:0%
that raises all sorts of questions not
 
06:06:15.030 --> 06:06:15.040 align:start position:0%
only because of the fact we can only
 
06:06:17.590 --> 06:06:17.600 align:start position:0%
provide what you give us money to do and
 
06:06:19.910 --> 06:06:19.920 align:start position:0%
this provides us with no money it raises
 
06:06:21.750 --> 06:06:21.760 align:start position:0%
some constitutional level questions and
 
06:06:23.510 --> 06:06:23.520 align:start position:0%
one of the things i would recommend and
 
06:06:26.070 --> 06:06:26.080 align:start position:0%
it was part of our commentary in our
 
06:06:28.070 --> 06:06:28.080 align:start position:0%
fiscal analysis on the bill but i would
 
06:06:29.510 --> 06:06:29.520 align:start position:0%
agree with the legislative budget
 
06:06:31.030 --> 06:06:31.040 align:start position:0%
assistance office that typically
 
06:06:32.868 --> 06:06:32.878 align:start position:0%
constitutional issues aren't included in
 
06:06:34.868 --> 06:06:34.878 align:start position:0%
their financial analysis so i think they
 
06:06:36.708 --> 06:06:36.718 align:start position:0%
intended for us to come before your
 
06:06:38.868 --> 06:06:38.878 align:start position:0%
committee to express what those concerns
 
06:06:39.830 --> 06:06:39.840 align:start position:0%
might be
 
06:06:41.670 --> 06:06:41.680 align:start position:0%
because in the current configuration of
 
06:06:44.310 --> 06:06:44.320 align:start position:0%
this this stipend essentially would be a
 
06:06:46.310 --> 06:06:46.320 align:start position:0%
payment from an executive branch agency
 
06:06:48.070 --> 06:06:48.080 align:start position:0%
to a legislative branch it's not coming
 
06:06:50.788 --> 06:06:50.798 align:start position:0%
from your budget i truly actually love
 
06:06:52.150 --> 06:06:52.160 align:start position:0%
working with you folks and if there
 
06:06:53.990 --> 06:06:54.000 align:start position:0%
wasn't a limitation i think you deserve
 
06:06:55.590 --> 06:06:55.600 align:start position:0%
to be paid for what you do that's a
 
06:06:57.030 --> 06:06:57.040 align:start position:0%
personal comment not a departmental
 
06:06:58.708 --> 06:06:58.718 align:start position:0%
comment uh because i've worked with you
 
06:07:01.270 --> 06:07:01.280 align:start position:0%
for many years and you do great work and
 
06:07:03.670 --> 06:07:03.680 align:start position:0%
you deserve something more than dollars
 
06:07:05.910 --> 06:07:05.920 align:start position:0%
but this is not the vehicle to establish
 
06:07:08.230 --> 06:07:08.240 align:start position:0%
that and and the reasons why are as
 
06:07:10.150 --> 06:07:10.160 align:start position:0%
follows when you think about the
 
06:07:12.070 --> 06:07:12.080 align:start position:0%
relationship between the stipend and
 
06:07:14.390 --> 06:07:14.400 align:start position:0%
giving money over to those people who
 
06:07:16.548 --> 06:07:16.558 align:start position:0%
would those legislators and both house
 
06:07:17.910 --> 06:07:17.920 align:start position:0%
members and senate members so this is
 
06:07:20.628 --> 06:07:20.638 align:start position:0%
425 that we're talking about we would
 
06:07:23.030 --> 06:07:23.040 align:start position:0%
have to do a financial review of their
 
06:07:24.868 --> 06:07:24.878 align:start position:0%
their background and then you know issue
 
06:07:27.030 --> 06:07:27.040 align:start position:0%
a stipend assuming that their median
 
06:07:29.910 --> 06:07:29.920 align:start position:0%
income was less than the 78 000
 
06:07:31.830 --> 06:07:31.840 align:start position:0%
for that prior year payment as explained
 
06:07:33.590 --> 06:07:33.600 align:start position:0%
by representative reed
 
06:07:35.270 --> 06:07:35.280 align:start position:0%
you would essentially
 
06:07:37.270 --> 06:07:37.280 align:start position:0%
potentially be considered an employee
 
06:07:39.110 --> 06:07:39.120 align:start position:0%
employer relationship with an executive
 
06:07:41.350 --> 06:07:41.360 align:start position:0%
branch agency so i would suggest looking
 
06:07:43.590 --> 06:07:43.600 align:start position:0%
to your your house legal counsel and i'd
 
06:07:45.030 --> 06:07:45.040 align:start position:0%
make the same recommendation to the
 
06:07:47.430 --> 06:07:47.440 align:start position:0%
senate if it passed over to that body
 
06:07:50.868 --> 06:07:50.878 align:start position:0%
that in terms of the constitutionality
 
06:07:52.150 --> 06:07:52.160 align:start position:0%
of a
 
06:07:54.548 --> 06:07:54.558 align:start position:0%
executive branch paying the legislature
 
06:07:56.470 --> 06:07:56.480 align:start position:0%
particularly since i come before you to
 
06:07:59.270 --> 06:07:59.280 align:start position:0%
testify does on its surface doesn't feel
 
06:08:00.708 --> 06:08:00.718 align:start position:0%
right and if it doesn't feel right you
 
06:08:02.628 --> 06:08:02.638 align:start position:0%
should examine why that doesn't feel
 
06:08:05.190 --> 06:08:05.200 align:start position:0%
right the other concern that we have
 
06:08:08.310 --> 06:08:08.320 align:start position:0%
here is public impression you have held
 
06:08:09.910 --> 06:08:09.920 align:start position:0%
very high the standard of being of all
 
06:08:11.990 --> 06:08:12.000 align:start position:0%
volunteer legislators and you do a great
 
06:08:13.350 --> 06:08:13.360 align:start position:0%
job with that
 
06:08:16.230 --> 06:08:16.240 align:start position:0%
we have people who come to our agency
 
06:08:18.070 --> 06:08:18.080 align:start position:0%
and there's no limitations you can be a
 
06:08:20.310 --> 06:08:20.320 align:start position:0%
legislator if you meet certain financial
 
06:08:22.708 --> 06:08:22.718 align:start position:0%
or clinical eligibility you are entitled
 
06:08:24.470 --> 06:08:24.480 align:start position:0%
to receiving certain public assistance
 
06:08:26.948 --> 06:08:26.958 align:start position:0%
from the department whether in terms of
 
06:08:28.470 --> 06:08:28.480 align:start position:0%
temporary assistance for needy family
 
06:08:30.470 --> 06:08:30.480 align:start position:0%
old age assistance snap benefits
 
06:08:32.470 --> 06:08:32.480 align:start position:0%
otherwise food stamps and other kind of
 
06:08:34.310 --> 06:08:34.320 align:start position:0%
resources you can apply for those as a
 
06:08:36.150 --> 06:08:36.160 align:start position:0%
citizen of the state of new hampshire so
 
06:08:37.830 --> 06:08:37.840 align:start position:0%
those benefits are out there they're
 
06:08:39.750 --> 06:08:39.760 align:start position:0%
available to
 
06:08:41.670 --> 06:08:41.680 align:start position:0%
the legislature as they are to all of
 
06:08:43.590 --> 06:08:43.600 align:start position:0%
our citizens and
 
06:08:45.430 --> 06:08:45.440 align:start position:0%
we have a funding mechanism for that we
 
06:08:47.510 --> 06:08:47.520 align:start position:0%
receive partial funding sometimes from
 
06:08:48.868 --> 06:08:48.878 align:start position:0%
the state partial funding from the
 
06:08:50.390 --> 06:08:50.400 align:start position:0%
federal government but it meets with
 
06:08:52.868 --> 06:08:52.878 align:start position:0%
with the federal constitutional muster
 
06:08:53.990 --> 06:08:54.000 align:start position:0%
so to say
 
06:08:56.310 --> 06:08:56.320 align:start position:0%
this would require i would imagine some
 
06:08:57.830 --> 06:08:57.840 align:start position:0%
type of leveraging of general fund
 
06:09:00.628 --> 06:09:00.638 align:start position:0%
dollars for us to be able to pay a
 
06:09:02.788 --> 06:09:02.798 align:start position:0%
stipend to legislature where there is
 
06:09:04.628 --> 06:09:04.638 align:start position:0%
nothing in federal law that would allow
 
06:09:06.230 --> 06:09:06.240 align:start position:0%
us to leverage any federal dollar
 
06:09:08.150 --> 06:09:08.160 align:start position:0%
matches for purposes of trying to
 
06:09:10.548 --> 06:09:10.558 align:start position:0%
implement this particular bill
 
06:09:12.548 --> 06:09:12.558 align:start position:0%
so i that really kind of concludes my
 
06:09:14.548 --> 06:09:14.558 align:start position:0%
commentary over the concerns i would
 
06:09:17.030 --> 06:09:17.040 align:start position:0%
just strongly recommend uh that you have
 
06:09:18.948 --> 06:09:18.958 align:start position:0%
this reviewed by your house legal
 
06:09:21.430 --> 06:09:21.440 align:start position:0%
counsel and if if there is any question
 
06:09:22.948 --> 06:09:22.958 align:start position:0%
please put at least a severability
 
06:09:24.948 --> 06:09:24.958 align:start position:0%
clause in the bill so if it is found
 
06:09:26.548 --> 06:09:26.558 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional that there's a
 
06:09:30.230 --> 06:09:30.240 align:start position:0%
mechanism to dealing with that um on the
 
06:09:32.150 --> 06:09:32.160 align:start position:0%
other hand i'd also say if you think
 
06:09:34.150 --> 06:09:34.160 align:start position:0%
this is constitutional you need to fund
 
06:09:36.390 --> 06:09:36.400 align:start position:0%
this to be able to make this happen so i
 
06:09:37.830 --> 06:09:37.840 align:start position:0%
think new hampshire does a great job i
 
06:09:39.590 --> 06:09:39.600 align:start position:0%
do applaud the efforts of representative
 
06:09:41.590 --> 06:09:41.600 align:start position:0%
reed she did a much better job with her
 
06:09:43.910 --> 06:09:43.920 align:start position:0%
two sentences saying too much work
 
06:09:45.670 --> 06:09:45.680 align:start position:0%
and it is true we would have to create
 
06:09:48.310 --> 06:09:48.320 align:start position:0%
an i.t system new staff and we don't
 
06:09:50.070 --> 06:09:50.080 align:start position:0%
have the resources not about not wanting
 
06:09:51.910 --> 06:09:51.920 align:start position:0%
to do the work we don't have the people
 
06:09:53.750 --> 06:09:53.760 align:start position:0%
to do this additional work that would be
 
06:09:56.150 --> 06:09:56.160 align:start position:0%
required under this legislation so for
 
06:09:57.270 --> 06:09:57.280 align:start position:0%
those of you who've heard from me in the
 
06:09:58.628 --> 06:09:58.638 align:start position:0%
past i want to thank you for your
 
06:10:01.350 --> 06:10:01.360 align:start position:0%
indulgence today and uh and i will take
 
06:10:03.510 --> 06:10:03.520 align:start position:0%
any questions if you have any energy
 
06:10:05.030 --> 06:10:05.040 align:start position:0%
this late in the day on your last bill
 
06:10:07.110 --> 06:10:07.120 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony appreciate
 
06:10:10.708 --> 06:10:10.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:12.548 --> 06:10:12.558 align:start position:0%
you were looking at me i know you were
 
06:10:12.558 --> 06:10:14.150 align:start position:0%
you were looking at me i know you were
um

06:10:14.150 --> 06:10:14.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:10:16.230 --> 06:10:16.240 align:start position:0%
i was thinking when we were listening to
 
06:10:18.708 --> 06:10:18.718 align:start position:0%
the testimony of the sponsor that we
 
06:10:20.628 --> 06:10:20.638 align:start position:0%
were looking at an employer employee
 
06:10:20.638 --> 06:10:22.470 align:start position:0%
were looking at an employer employee
relationship

06:10:22.470 --> 06:10:22.480 align:start position:0%
relationship
 
06:10:22.480 --> 06:10:23.590 align:start position:0%
relationship
and

06:10:23.590 --> 06:10:23.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:10:26.230 --> 06:10:26.240 align:start position:0%
as such we would probably also be
 
06:10:27.910 --> 06:10:27.920 align:start position:0%
looking at all sorts of workers
 
06:10:27.920 --> 06:10:29.270 align:start position:0%
looking at all sorts of workers

06:10:33.190 --> 06:10:33.200 align:start position:0%
perhaps depending on
 
06:10:36.150 --> 06:10:36.160 align:start position:0%
what else was categorized medical
 
06:10:36.160 --> 06:10:37.830 align:start position:0%
what else was categorized medical

06:10:37.830 --> 06:10:37.840 align:start position:0%
issues
 
06:10:39.670 --> 06:10:39.680 align:start position:0%
i don't know if they would be qualifying
 
06:10:39.680 --> 06:10:40.390 align:start position:0%
i don't know if they would be qualifying
for

06:10:40.390 --> 06:10:40.400 align:start position:0%
for
 
06:10:42.230 --> 06:10:42.240 align:start position:0%
any kind of pension state pension or
 
06:10:44.070 --> 06:10:44.080 align:start position:0%
whatever it would be i mean it's all
 
06:10:45.510 --> 06:10:45.520 align:start position:0%
questions that were up in the air so i
 
06:10:47.670 --> 06:10:47.680 align:start position:0%
was thinking of that before you sat down
 
06:10:49.350 --> 06:10:49.360 align:start position:0%
in that chair
 
06:10:52.230 --> 06:10:52.240 align:start position:0%
but i do appreciate you coming in
 
06:10:53.750 --> 06:10:53.760 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
06:10:55.350 --> 06:10:55.360 align:start position:0%
public impression
 
06:10:57.590 --> 06:10:57.600 align:start position:0%
i think that that is very important and
 
06:10:59.750 --> 06:10:59.760 align:start position:0%
importantly i think that it is the
 
06:11:02.470 --> 06:11:02.480 align:start position:0%
system the i.t system needed are you
 
06:11:03.990 --> 06:11:04.000 align:start position:0%
saying that you would also need
 
06:11:07.430 --> 06:11:07.440 align:start position:0%
additional employees to handle that
 
06:11:11.430 --> 06:11:11.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:12.948 --> 06:11:12.958 align:start position:0%
and of course i'd be looking to my
 
06:11:14.310 --> 06:11:14.320 align:start position:0%
financial manager who couldn't make her
 
06:11:16.150 --> 06:11:16.160 align:start position:0%
way here today but it would not be more
 
06:11:17.590 --> 06:11:17.600 align:start position:0%
than one staff but i can certainly get
 
06:11:17.600 --> 06:11:19.350 align:start position:0%
than one staff but i can certainly get
20.

06:11:19.350 --> 06:11:19.360 align:start position:0%
20.
 
06:11:21.430 --> 06:11:21.440 align:start position:0%
she is not here um but my understanding
 
06:11:23.190 --> 06:11:23.200 align:start position:0%
was it would not be more than one staff
 
06:11:25.190 --> 06:11:25.200 align:start position:0%
to be able to do this but there would be
 
06:11:27.190 --> 06:11:27.200 align:start position:0%
systems related changes and again no
 
06:11:29.510 --> 06:11:29.520 align:start position:0%
funding to doing this the other thing to
 
06:11:31.110 --> 06:11:31.120 align:start position:0%
mention going back to represent hilt and
 
06:11:33.910 --> 06:11:33.920 align:start position:0%
it's related to your question is one of
 
06:11:35.750 --> 06:11:35.760 align:start position:0%
the things we identified is whether this
 
06:11:37.430 --> 06:11:37.440 align:start position:0%
is taxable i mean these are really
 
06:11:39.510 --> 06:11:39.520 align:start position:0%
significant questions and to assume that
 
06:11:41.990 --> 06:11:42.000 align:start position:0%
this stipend wouldn't be taxable
 
06:11:44.390 --> 06:11:44.400 align:start position:0%
i would suggest not only um seeking
 
06:11:45.910 --> 06:11:45.920 align:start position:0%
house counsel but you may want to seek
 
06:11:48.390 --> 06:11:48.400 align:start position:0%
counsel uh from your tax attorney as
 
06:11:48.400 --> 06:11:49.750 align:start position:0%
counsel uh from your tax attorney as
well

06:11:49.750 --> 06:11:49.760 align:start position:0%

thank you
 
06:11:53.030 --> 06:11:53.040 align:start position:0%
and there was a follow-up question um uh
 
06:11:54.948 --> 06:11:54.958 align:start position:0%
chairman hill but i interrupted
 
06:11:54.958 --> 06:11:56.628 align:start position:0%

06:14:42.708 --> 06:14:42.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:45.030 --> 06:14:45.040 align:start position:0%
nobody in newmarket
 
06:14:46.948 --> 06:14:46.958 align:start position:0%
in the in the 20th century had really
 
06:14:50.708 --> 06:14:50.718 align:start position:0%
heard about him and about his legacy
 
06:14:53.830 --> 06:14:53.840 align:start position:0%
fast forward to about 1990 a gentleman
 
06:14:56.708 --> 06:14:56.718 align:start position:0%
by the name of richard alperin who was a
 
06:14:59.110 --> 06:14:59.120 align:start position:0%
resident of new market was living on elm
 
06:15:01.430 --> 06:15:01.440 align:start position:0%
street across from the
 
06:15:01.440 --> 06:15:02.310 align:start position:0%
street across from the
um

06:15:02.310 --> 06:15:02.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:15:04.390 --> 06:15:04.400 align:start position:0%
riverside cemetery in new market and he
 
06:15:06.788 --> 06:15:06.798 align:start position:0%
noticed a sort of like a family burial
 
06:15:09.430 --> 06:15:09.440 align:start position:0%
plot and it was a chess will plot and so
 
06:15:12.390 --> 06:15:12.400 align:start position:0%
mr alfred became very curious about who
 
06:15:15.510 --> 06:15:15.520 align:start position:0%
the chess wills were and he
 
06:15:18.390 --> 06:15:18.400 align:start position:0%
started doing research on wentworth and
 
06:15:20.788 --> 06:15:20.798 align:start position:0%
wrote an article in the newspaper about
 
06:15:22.150 --> 06:15:22.160 align:start position:0%
you know mr
 
06:15:25.190 --> 06:15:25.200 align:start position:0%
caswell um a couple of years later
 
06:15:27.510 --> 06:15:27.520 align:start position:0%
mr albrin and his family
 
06:15:30.548 --> 06:15:30.558 align:start position:0%
bought a home on elm street i mean on
 
06:15:32.788 --> 06:15:32.798 align:start position:0%
south main street in new market and
 
06:15:34.948 --> 06:15:34.958 align:start position:0%
again right next to his building that he
 
06:15:37.910 --> 06:15:37.920 align:start position:0%
bought there was this family burial plot
 
06:15:39.670 --> 06:15:39.680 align:start position:0%
and that happened to be the chessville
 
06:15:42.628 --> 06:15:42.638 align:start position:0%
cemetery which intrigued um
 
06:15:45.830 --> 06:15:45.840 align:start position:0%
mr alperin even more and so he started
 
06:15:47.510 --> 06:15:47.520 align:start position:0%
researching um
 
06:15:52.628 --> 06:15:52.638 align:start position:0%
wentworth had a roadside marker put
 
06:15:57.110 --> 06:15:57.120 align:start position:0%
next to the cemetery and from there um
 
06:16:01.430 --> 06:16:01.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:02.788 --> 06:16:02.798 align:start position:0%
there's been research on his life
 
06:16:06.070 --> 06:16:06.080 align:start position:0%
through unh students
 
06:16:06.080 --> 06:16:08.830 align:start position:0%
through unh students
and

06:16:08.830 --> 06:16:08.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:11.750 --> 06:16:11.760 align:start position:0%
about maybe about 10 or 15 years ago a
 
06:16:13.910 --> 06:16:13.920 align:start position:0%
fellow by the name of john herman who
 
06:16:15.990 --> 06:16:16.000 align:start position:0%
moved to newmarket and he was very
 
06:16:19.830 --> 06:16:19.840 align:start position:0%
curious about the cemetery and we formed
 
06:16:21.030 --> 06:16:21.040 align:start position:0%
a couple years ago we formed the
 
06:16:22.548 --> 06:16:22.558 align:start position:0%
wentworth chessbill
 
06:16:25.910 --> 06:16:25.920 align:start position:0%
appreciation society because all of us
 
06:16:28.788 --> 06:16:28.798 align:start position:0%
in town or many of us in town 196
 
06:16:31.190 --> 06:16:31.200 align:start position:0%
members of the society realize that they
 
06:16:33.750 --> 06:16:33.760 align:start position:0%
wanted to learn about learn more about
 
06:16:36.390 --> 06:16:36.400 align:start position:0%
this hidden figure and to honor his um
 
06:16:38.628 --> 06:16:38.638 align:start position:0%
contributions and so
 
06:16:41.430 --> 06:16:41.440 align:start position:0%
we are working on having a monument
 
06:16:43.190 --> 06:16:43.200 align:start position:0%
built we're going to it's going to be
 
06:16:45.190 --> 06:16:45.200 align:start position:0%
funded by the group a monument to one
 
06:16:47.590 --> 06:16:47.600 align:start position:0%
earth chess well built in town
 
06:16:49.670 --> 06:16:49.680 align:start position:0%
now i think that the important lesson
 
06:16:52.788 --> 06:16:52.798 align:start position:0%
about mr cheswell is that

business in a town um
 
06:17:22.470 --> 06:17:22.480 align:start position:0%

taking my
 
06:17:49.910 --> 06:17:49.920 align:start position:0%
in the bill uh the appropriation line it
 
06:17:52.230 --> 06:17:52.240 align:start position:0%
says the sum necessary for the biennium
 
06:17:54.868 --> 06:17:54.878 align:start position:0%
can we have a little more specifics as
 
06:17:57.030 --> 06:17:57.040 align:start position:0%
to that i mean we're talking
 
06:18:00.628 --> 06:18:00.638 align:start position:0%
i don't 20 000 we're talking 200 i mean

folks who
 
06:18:09.590 --> 06:18:09.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:11.990 --> 06:18:12.000 align:start position:0%
doing the portraits would have a budget
 
06:18:14.150 --> 06:18:14.160 align:start position:0%
you know based on comparables to what's
 
06:18:19.270 --> 06:18:19.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:20.628 --> 06:18:20.638 align:start position:0%

06:18:40.230 --> 06:18:40.240 align:start position:0%
historical committee to acquire and
 
06:18:42.548 --> 06:18:42.558 align:start position:0%
display the likeness of wentworth to as
 
06:18:42.558 --> 06:18:44.548 align:start position:0%
display the likeness of wentworth to as
well

06:18:44.548 --> 06:18:44.558 align:start position:0%
well
 
06:18:46.788 --> 06:18:46.798 align:start position:0%
i am on that committee
 
06:18:47.910 --> 06:18:47.920 align:start position:0%
we don't
 
06:18:47.920 --> 06:18:49.270 align:start position:0%
we don't
acquire

06:18:49.270 --> 06:18:49.280 align:start position:0%
acquire
 
06:18:51.350 --> 06:18:51.360 align:start position:0%
uh we don't pay for these portraits or
 
06:18:51.360 --> 06:18:52.310 align:start position:0%
uh we don't pay for these portraits or
anything

06:18:52.310 --> 06:18:52.320 align:start position:0%
anything
 
06:18:54.468 --> 06:18:54.478 align:start position:0%
are you familiar with how portraits are
 
06:18:54.478 --> 06:18:55.670 align:start position:0%
are you familiar with how portraits are
acquired

06:18:55.670 --> 06:18:55.680 align:start position:0%
acquired
 
06:18:57.350 --> 06:18:57.360 align:start position:0%
for the state i mean
 
06:18:59.270 --> 06:18:59.280 align:start position:0%
i guess what i could say is the
 
06:18:59.280 --> 06:19:00.468 align:start position:0%
i guess what i could say is the
committee

06:19:00.468 --> 06:19:00.478 align:start position:0%
committee
 
06:19:03.190 --> 06:19:03.200 align:start position:0%
could accept it to present
 
06:19:05.270 --> 06:19:05.280 align:start position:0%
in the process that they have to put
 
06:19:08.310 --> 06:19:08.320 align:start position:0%
before the executive council to accept
 
06:19:11.030 --> 06:19:11.040 align:start position:0%
it but what would be your first step
 
06:19:13.990 --> 06:19:14.000 align:start position:0%
i don't know the mechanism i believe
 
06:19:16.310 --> 06:19:16.320 align:start position:0%
that the governor would be able to draw
 
06:19:19.190 --> 06:19:19.200 align:start position:0%
a warrant and then that warrant would be
 
06:19:21.350 --> 06:19:21.360 align:start position:0%
approved but approved or disapproved by
 
06:19:23.670 --> 06:19:23.680 align:start position:0%
the executive council
 
06:19:25.270 --> 06:19:25.280 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:19:27.110 --> 06:19:27.120 align:start position:0%
representative expedia
 
06:19:28.548 --> 06:19:28.558 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:19:30.708 --> 06:19:30.718 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you
 
06:19:31.990 --> 06:19:32.000 align:start position:0%
representative dilorenzo for your
 
06:19:33.350 --> 06:19:33.360 align:start position:0%
testimony i
 
06:19:33.360 --> 06:19:34.390 align:start position:0%
testimony i
um

06:19:34.390 --> 06:19:34.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:19:36.548 --> 06:19:36.558 align:start position:0%
do we have any i'm just i'm curious do
 
06:19:38.628 --> 06:19:38.638 align:start position:0%
we have any other
 
06:19:41.110 --> 06:19:41.120 align:start position:0%
any other portraits of people of color
 
06:19:42.868 --> 06:19:42.878 align:start position:0%
in the state house
 
06:19:45.110 --> 06:19:45.120 align:start position:0%
not that i'm aware of
 
06:19:47.830 --> 06:19:47.840 align:start position:0%
i can't say that there aren't because
 
06:19:47.840 --> 06:19:48.788 align:start position:0%
i can't say that there aren't because
again

06:19:48.788 --> 06:19:48.798 align:start position:0%
again
 
06:19:51.510 --> 06:19:51.520 align:start position:0%
there are many hidden figures in
 
06:19:53.590 --> 06:19:53.600 align:start position:0%
you know in this state and in this
 
06:19:53.600 --> 06:19:54.708 align:start position:0%
you know in this state and in this
country

06:19:54.708 --> 06:19:54.718 align:start position:0%
country
 
06:19:56.628 --> 06:19:56.638 align:start position:0%
so it's possible that someone hanging in
 
06:19:59.350 --> 06:19:59.360 align:start position:0%
the um hall right now could could be a
 
06:20:01.990 --> 06:20:02.000 align:start position:0%
person of color that we don't know about
 
06:20:04.948 --> 06:20:04.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:07.830 --> 06:20:07.840 align:start position:0%
i have one or two
 
06:20:09.670 --> 06:20:09.680 align:start position:0%
we actually have
 
06:20:11.830 --> 06:20:11.840 align:start position:0%
a picture and and know what he looks
 
06:20:11.840 --> 06:20:13.510 align:start position:0%
a picture and and know what he looks
like

06:20:13.510 --> 06:20:13.520 align:start position:0%
like
 
06:20:17.270 --> 06:20:17.280 align:start position:0%
very good you know we have this i i
 
06:20:19.110 --> 06:20:19.120 align:start position:0%
i don't think they want a portrait of
 
06:20:20.830 --> 06:20:20.840 align:start position:0%
this you know
 
06:20:24.230 --> 06:20:24.240 align:start position:0%
um so so how would
 
06:20:27.830 --> 06:20:27.840 align:start position:0%
this portrait be acquired if um
 
06:20:29.830 --> 06:20:29.840 align:start position:0%
it would have to be a composite i don't
 
06:20:31.710 --> 06:20:31.720 align:start position:0%
think it would look like turtleman here
 
06:20:31.720 --> 06:20:33.030 align:start position:0%
think it would look like turtleman here
[Laughter]

06:20:33.030 --> 06:20:33.040 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
06:20:35.190 --> 06:20:35.200 align:start position:0%
i know that there are 40 right now there
 
06:20:37.270 --> 06:20:37.280 align:start position:0%
are about 40 um descendants of mr
 
06:20:39.830 --> 06:20:39.840 align:start position:0%
chessville in in new hampshire and
 
06:20:42.230 --> 06:20:42.240 align:start position:0%
i think that
 
06:20:44.150 --> 06:20:44.160 align:start position:0%
the right artist could probably do a
 
06:20:46.390 --> 06:20:46.400 align:start position:0%
composite of um
 
06:20:48.788 --> 06:20:48.798 align:start position:0%
a painting okay okay
 
06:20:51.670 --> 06:20:51.680 align:start position:0%
second question i have is i this
 
06:20:54.868 --> 06:20:54.878 align:start position:0%
the bill reads almost exactly like
 
06:20:57.350 --> 06:20:57.360 align:start position:0%
the um
 
06:20:59.830 --> 06:20:59.840 align:start position:0%
the day that was created um by the
 
06:21:04.788 --> 06:21:04.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:07.670 --> 06:21:07.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:10.390 --> 06:21:10.400 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure whether most people most
 
06:21:13.190 --> 06:21:13.200 align:start position:0%
reps voted for that day
 
06:21:16.230 --> 06:21:16.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:19.510 --> 06:21:19.520 align:start position:0%
as a salute to a revolutionary war um
 
06:21:24.070 --> 06:21:24.080 align:start position:0%
person um or as a african-american or as
 
06:21:26.310 --> 06:21:26.320 align:start position:0%
a town crier or a town clerk this is the
 
06:21:27.830 --> 06:21:27.840 align:start position:0%
first time i've heard about the town
 
06:21:29.750 --> 06:21:29.760 align:start position:0%
crier and town clerk
 
06:21:33.270 --> 06:21:33.280 align:start position:0%
is there any record of him being a
 
06:21:35.270 --> 06:21:35.280 align:start position:0%
state figure
 
06:21:36.948 --> 06:21:36.958 align:start position:0%
because i'm not sure
 
06:21:40.548 --> 06:21:40.558 align:start position:0%
quite frankly whether there are
 
06:21:43.030 --> 06:21:43.040 align:start position:0%
portraits in the state house of people
 
06:21:46.548 --> 06:21:46.558 align:start position:0%
that were primarily town elected
 
06:21:48.628 --> 06:21:48.638 align:start position:0%
versus state elected i don't know if
 
06:21:51.750 --> 06:21:51.760 align:start position:0%
that's a criteria i have no idea i'm not
 
06:21:53.830 --> 06:21:53.840 align:start position:0%
sure about a state experience i do know
 
06:21:55.350 --> 06:21:55.360 align:start position:0%
that he was a veteran of the
 
06:21:57.750 --> 06:21:57.760 align:start position:0%
revolutionary war right
 
06:21:57.760 --> 06:21:59.030 align:start position:0%
revolutionary war right
um

06:21:59.030 --> 06:21:59.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:22:01.670 --> 06:22:01.680 align:start position:0%
you mentioned his business he was um he
 
06:22:04.150 --> 06:22:04.160 align:start position:0%

06:22:06.628 --> 06:22:06.638 align:start position:0%

06:22:08.548 --> 06:22:08.558 align:start position:0%
well um
 
06:22:11.270 --> 06:22:11.280 align:start position:0%
he owned he owned um
 
06:22:14.548 --> 06:22:14.558 align:start position:0%
property in new market um the chessboard
 
06:22:16.548 --> 06:22:16.558 align:start position:0%

downtown
 
06:22:17.760 --> 06:22:18.708 align:start position:0%
downtown
um

06:22:18.708 --> 06:22:18.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:22:20.788 --> 06:22:20.798 align:start position:0%
and then as far as his day-to-day work
 
06:22:23.190 --> 06:22:23.200 align:start position:0%
he was a teacher
 
06:22:26.390 --> 06:22:26.400 align:start position:0%
day to day he was a teacher yes i see
 
06:22:26.400 --> 06:22:29.030 align:start position:0%
day to day he was a teacher yes i see
um

06:22:29.030 --> 06:22:29.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:22:31.350 --> 06:22:31.360 align:start position:0%
and and the monument that's being worked
 
06:22:34.788 --> 06:22:34.798 align:start position:0%
on currently that is a town-funded uh
 
06:22:37.190 --> 06:22:37.200 align:start position:0%
new market funded no it'll be privately
 
06:22:37.200 --> 06:22:38.150 align:start position:0%
new market funded no it'll be privately
funded

06:22:38.150 --> 06:22:38.160 align:start position:0%
funded
 
06:22:41.670 --> 06:22:41.680 align:start position:0%
privately funded for the library that he
 
06:22:44.468 --> 06:22:44.478 align:start position:0%
donated to or
 
06:22:46.468 --> 06:22:46.478 align:start position:0%
well the library um
 
06:22:49.030 --> 06:22:49.040 align:start position:0%
that he donated to um i don't believe
 
06:22:51.830 --> 06:22:51.840 align:start position:0%
exists anymore um because i mean that
 
06:22:54.070 --> 06:22:54.080 align:start position:0%
was in like
 
06:22:56.788 --> 06:22:56.798 align:start position:0%
17 something i read somewhere that he
 
06:22:58.708 --> 06:22:58.718 align:start position:0%
had donated books to that do we know
 
06:23:00.708 --> 06:23:00.718 align:start position:0%
that do we know what those
 
06:23:02.868 --> 06:23:02.878 align:start position:0%
whether they were historical

good afternoon members of the committee
 
06:24:12.548 --> 06:24:12.558 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is paul smith i
 
06:24:15.270 --> 06:24:15.280 align:start position:0%
have taken a half hour off to be here as
 
06:24:17.270 --> 06:24:17.280 align:start position:0%
a private citizen
 
06:24:19.510 --> 06:24:19.520 align:start position:0%
to support this legislation
 
06:24:22.868 --> 06:24:22.878 align:start position:0%
um the reason i am doing so is uh among
 
06:24:25.110 --> 06:24:25.120 align:start position:0%
the many myriad of things and there are
 
06:24:27.590 --> 06:24:27.600 align:start position:0%
a couple things that you uh may may not
 
06:24:30.868 --> 06:24:30.878 align:start position:0%
have known um mr brother cheswell was
 
06:24:34.070 --> 06:24:34.080 align:start position:0%
also elected to be a drafter of the new
 
06:24:35.830 --> 06:24:35.840 align:start position:0%
hampshire state constitution although he
 
06:24:38.310 --> 06:24:38.320 align:start position:0%
was unable to serve
 
06:24:40.310 --> 06:24:40.320 align:start position:0%
the fact of the matter is
 
06:24:41.670 --> 06:24:41.680 align:start position:0%
he was
 
06:24:43.110 --> 06:24:43.120 align:start position:0%
a freemason
 
06:24:44.948 --> 06:24:44.958 align:start position:0%
and i am an active freemason in the
 
06:24:46.390 --> 06:24:46.400 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire i've
 
06:24:47.430 --> 06:24:47.440 align:start position:0%
served in the grand lodge of new
 
06:24:49.110 --> 06:24:49.120 align:start position:0%
hampshire for several years
 
06:24:50.628 --> 06:24:50.638 align:start position:0%
the grand lodge of new hampshire i've
 
06:24:53.030 --> 06:24:53.040 align:start position:0%
just spoken with the grand master
 
06:24:54.948 --> 06:24:54.958 align:start position:0%
we fully support
 
06:24:57.110 --> 06:24:57.120 align:start position:0%
uh this this notion
 
06:24:59.350 --> 06:24:59.360 align:start position:0%
on top of according to george mason
 
06:25:02.230 --> 06:25:02.240 align:start position:0%
university brother cheswell is the first
 
06:25:04.468 --> 06:25:04.478 align:start position:0%
elected african-american in the united
 
06:25:04.478 --> 06:25:05.750 align:start position:0%
elected african-american in the united
states

06:25:05.750 --> 06:25:05.760 align:start position:0%
states
 
06:25:07.350 --> 06:25:07.360 align:start position:0%
and that is
 
06:25:09.350 --> 06:25:09.360 align:start position:0%
that achievement can't be taken away
 
06:25:11.190 --> 06:25:11.200 align:start position:0%
from any place
 
06:25:13.350 --> 06:25:13.360 align:start position:0%
he was not only was he an active
 
06:25:16.948 --> 06:25:16.958 align:start position:0%
freemason in his lifetime he was a right
 
06:25:19.030 --> 06:25:19.040 align:start position:0%
worshipful brother meaning he was the
 
06:25:20.948 --> 06:25:20.958 align:start position:0%
master of his lodge and served in grand
 
06:25:23.030 --> 06:25:23.040 align:start position:0%
lodge capacity as well
 
06:25:26.390 --> 06:25:26.400 align:start position:0%
this was unheard of my friends even at
 
06:25:27.510 --> 06:25:27.520 align:start position:0%
the time
 
06:25:29.110 --> 06:25:29.120 align:start position:0%
if you if you hear anything about
 
06:25:31.190 --> 06:25:31.200 align:start position:0%
freemasonry especially
 
06:25:32.628 --> 06:25:32.638 align:start position:0%
you've heard of the term prince hall
 
06:25:34.948 --> 06:25:34.958 align:start position:0%
freemasonry historically there had been
 
06:25:37.590 --> 06:25:37.600 align:start position:0%
a bit of a black and white freemasonry
 
06:25:40.070 --> 06:25:40.080 align:start position:0%
and and it's an unfortunate thing
 
06:25:43.190 --> 06:25:43.200 align:start position:0%
and it's it's been resolved in in recent
 
06:25:44.390 --> 06:25:44.400 align:start position:0%
years as with
 
06:25:45.750 --> 06:25:45.760 align:start position:0%
many things
 
06:25:45.760 --> 06:25:46.708 align:start position:0%
many things
but

06:25:46.708 --> 06:25:46.718 align:start position:0%
but
 
06:25:46.718 --> 06:25:47.750 align:start position:0%
but
but

06:25:47.750 --> 06:25:47.760 align:start position:0%
but
 
06:25:49.910 --> 06:25:49.920 align:start position:0%
brother cheswell was
 
06:25:52.548 --> 06:25:52.558 align:start position:0%
a member of the regular grand lodge
 
06:25:54.548 --> 06:25:54.558 align:start position:0%
there was no schism in new hampshire we
 
06:25:57.110 --> 06:25:57.120 align:start position:0%
didn't have separate freemasons in new
 
06:25:58.948 --> 06:25:58.958 align:start position:0%
hampshire we've always just had the
 
06:26:01.350 --> 06:26:01.360 align:start position:0%
grand lodge of new hampshire
 
06:26:02.868 --> 06:26:02.878 align:start position:0%
i want to address the appropriation
 
06:26:04.150 --> 06:26:04.160 align:start position:0%
issue for a moment
 
06:26:05.990 --> 06:26:06.000 align:start position:0%
the grand lodge of new hampshire is
 
06:26:08.708 --> 06:26:08.718 align:start position:0%
willing to fund this portrait
 
06:26:11.110 --> 06:26:11.120 align:start position:0%
we are willing to cover it entirely and
 
06:26:14.868 --> 06:26:14.878 align:start position:0%
have one of our artists
 
06:26:17.430 --> 06:26:17.440 align:start position:0%
i i would just mention that there is a
 
06:26:18.868 --> 06:26:18.878 align:start position:0%
brother who lives in the town of
 
06:26:21.510 --> 06:26:21.520 align:start position:0%
merrimack his name is ryan flynn
 
06:26:24.788 --> 06:26:24.798 align:start position:0%
and he was commissioned and he actually
 
06:26:26.788 --> 06:26:26.798 align:start position:0%
just painted a portrait for the grand
 
06:26:29.350 --> 06:26:29.360 align:start position:0%
lodge of south carolina of brother
 
06:26:31.670 --> 06:26:31.680 align:start position:0%
prince hall in massachusetts and they
 
06:26:35.030 --> 06:26:35.040 align:start position:0%
took uh period documentation um
 
06:26:38.310 --> 06:26:38.320 align:start position:0%
from from his likenesses uh from uh
 
06:26:40.310 --> 06:26:40.320 align:start position:0%
every every component of his of his
 
06:26:43.350 --> 06:26:43.360 align:start position:0%
dress and i'm happy to share a picture
 
06:26:46.948 --> 06:26:46.958 align:start position:0%
of that um portrait with you uh but i i
 
06:26:49.430 --> 06:26:49.440 align:start position:0%
think it's extremely important to know
 
06:26:51.990 --> 06:26:52.000 align:start position:0%
that this brother was an officer in the
 
06:26:55.430 --> 06:26:55.440 align:start position:0%
revolutionary army this brother was uh
 
06:26:57.270 --> 06:26:57.280 align:start position:0%
exceptional he was the first elected
 
06:26:58.868 --> 06:26:58.878 align:start position:0%
african-american in the history of the
 
06:27:00.390 --> 06:27:00.400 align:start position:0%
united states
 
06:27:02.628 --> 06:27:02.638 align:start position:0%
and his portrait
 
06:27:04.708 --> 06:27:04.718 align:start position:0%
belongs on the wall of the state house
 
06:27:07.270 --> 06:27:07.280 align:start position:0%
there are there are portraits
 
06:27:08.948 --> 06:27:08.958 align:start position:0%
and and some of you who are familiar
 
06:27:10.628 --> 06:27:10.638 align:start position:0%
with the portraits in the states house
 
06:27:12.150 --> 06:27:12.160 align:start position:0%
there's one in particular that's really
 
06:27:15.030 --> 06:27:15.040 align:start position:0%
bothersome to many people and that's a a
 
06:27:17.750 --> 06:27:17.760 align:start position:0%
certain person who who just donated his
 
06:27:19.750 --> 06:27:19.760 align:start position:0%
picture and they hung it up and it's
 
06:27:21.430 --> 06:27:21.440 align:start position:0%
still there on the first floor and i
 
06:27:23.030 --> 06:27:23.040 align:start position:0%
know representative wall knows which one
 
06:27:24.310 --> 06:27:24.320 align:start position:0%
that is because she's on the joint
 
06:27:26.948 --> 06:27:26.958 align:start position:0%
legislative historical committee
 
06:27:29.350 --> 06:27:29.360 align:start position:0%
um but i would just i would just note uh
 
06:27:32.070 --> 06:27:32.080 align:start position:0%
that um you know the
 
06:27:34.868 --> 06:27:34.878 align:start position:0%
the most recent uh portrait that was was
 
06:27:37.030 --> 06:27:37.040 align:start position:0%
commissioned and hung up with us uh
 
06:27:39.990 --> 06:27:40.000 align:start position:0%
marilla um oh gosh
 
06:27:42.788 --> 06:27:42.798 align:start position:0%
right marilla ricker and uh that was uh
 
06:27:46.070 --> 06:27:46.080 align:start position:0%
that was done by private funds and uh i
 
06:27:48.230 --> 06:27:48.240 align:start position:0%
will note that the grand lodge of new
 
06:27:50.868 --> 06:27:50.878 align:start position:0%
hampshire of of masons is willing to to
 
06:27:52.708 --> 06:27:52.718 align:start position:0%
cover the cost of
 
06:27:54.628 --> 06:27:54.638 align:start position:0%
of this type of portrait and we think
 
06:27:56.868 --> 06:27:56.878 align:start position:0%
it's important it's a important part of
 
06:27:58.390 --> 06:27:58.400 align:start position:0%
new hampshire history it's important
 
06:28:01.350 --> 06:28:01.360 align:start position:0%
part of national history and i
 
06:28:03.190 --> 06:28:03.200 align:start position:0%
again i i thought it was important
 
06:28:05.590 --> 06:28:05.600 align:start position:0%
enough that i'd uh take time off
 
06:28:08.150 --> 06:28:08.160 align:start position:0%

06:28:09.590 --> 06:28:09.600 align:start position:0%

that wentworth cheswell called home
 
06:29:32.150 --> 06:29:32.160 align:start position:0%
the first african-american elected to
 
06:29:34.150 --> 06:29:34.160 align:start position:0%
public office in this country and now we
 
06:29:36.628 --> 06:29:36.638 align:start position:0%

06:29:38.948 --> 06:29:38.958 align:start position:0%
new hampshire constitution and the whole
 
06:29:41.350 --> 06:29:41.360 align:start position:0%
litany of accomplishments and i just
 
06:29:44.468 --> 06:29:44.478 align:start position:0%
want to end with saying that um if if
 
06:29:46.468 --> 06:29:46.478 align:start position:0%
the our idea of the american dream is
 
06:29:48.150 --> 06:29:48.160 align:start position:0%
that no matter who you are no matter
 
06:29:49.830 --> 06:29:49.840 align:start position:0%
what odds you might face that if you
 
06:29:51.830 --> 06:29:51.840 align:start position:0%
work really hard and do the right things
 
06:29:53.830 --> 06:29:53.840 align:start position:0%
that you can not just make it but
 
06:29:55.430 --> 06:29:55.440 align:start position:0%
influence the world around you in good
 
06:29:58.788 --> 06:29:58.798 align:start position:0%
ways then there is no person we should
 
06:30:01.510 --> 06:30:01.520 align:start position:0%
honor more than him really because he
 
06:30:03.750 --> 06:30:03.760 align:start position:0%
embodies that um
 
06:30:06.628 --> 06:30:06.638 align:start position:0%
not just success on his own even just to
 
06:30:07.750 --> 06:30:07.760 align:start position:0%
succeed would have been an
 
06:30:10.788 --> 06:30:10.798 align:start position:0%
accomplishment but he changed the world
 
06:30:13.030 --> 06:30:13.040 align:start position:0%
around him and helped form our state and
 
06:30:15.510 --> 06:30:15.520 align:start position:0%
our country and i i can't i can't
 
06:30:17.430 --> 06:30:17.440 align:start position:0%

district six the towns of durham and
 
06:33:08.150 --> 06:33:08.160 align:start position:0%
madbury and actually
 
06:33:09.590 --> 06:33:09.600 align:start position:0%
um i'm in favor of the song it's
 
06:33:11.030 --> 06:33:11.040 align:start position:0%
actually a nice little song and it's
 
06:33:12.628 --> 06:33:12.638 align:start position:0%
representative wallace correctly noticed
 
06:33:14.788 --> 06:33:14.798 align:start position:0%
it is on youtube
 
06:33:14.798 --> 06:33:15.510 align:start position:0%
it is on youtube
and

06:33:15.510 --> 06:33:15.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:33:15.520 --> 06:33:16.628 align:start position:0%
and
my

06:33:16.628 --> 06:33:16.638 align:start position:0%
my
 
06:33:17.990 --> 06:33:18.000 align:start position:0%
i've signed the pink card opposition
 
06:33:20.548 --> 06:33:20.558 align:start position:0%
mostly i feel this is the wrong solution
 
06:33:22.310 --> 06:33:22.320 align:start position:0%
to the problem that made the resolution
 
06:33:24.150 --> 06:33:24.160 align:start position:0%
necessary and that's an issue that's
 
06:33:24.160 --> 06:33:25.430 align:start position:0%
necessary and that's an issue that's
endemic

06:33:25.430 --> 06:33:25.440 align:start position:0%
endemic
 
06:33:27.350 --> 06:33:27.360 align:start position:0%
to our citizen legislature where we have
 
06:33:28.230 --> 06:33:28.240 align:start position:0%
to work
 
06:33:30.708 --> 06:33:30.718 align:start position:0%
do a lot of quick and dirty work with um
 
06:33:31.750 --> 06:33:31.760 align:start position:0%
you know
 
06:33:33.990 --> 06:33:34.000 align:start position:0%
with limited resources so this was uh
 
06:33:35.750 --> 06:33:35.760 align:start position:0%
came as part of a senate omnibus bill
 
06:33:37.590 --> 06:33:37.600 align:start position:0%
with several other rights maybe just two
 
06:33:40.230 --> 06:33:40.240 align:start position:0%
other observances and
 
06:33:42.948 --> 06:33:42.958 align:start position:0%
they were adding her song to the list of
 
06:33:44.708 --> 06:33:44.718 align:start position:0%
state songs i think there's about 10 of
 
06:33:46.708 --> 06:33:46.718 align:start position:0%
them the most recent one was it was
 
06:33:47.670 --> 06:33:47.680 align:start position:0%
actually written by one of our
 
06:33:49.670 --> 06:33:49.680 align:start position:0%
colleagues barry represent barry palmer
 
06:33:51.990 --> 06:33:52.000 align:start position:0%
from nashua
 
06:33:52.000 --> 06:33:53.350 align:start position:0%
from nashua
and

06:33:53.350 --> 06:33:53.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:33:54.948 --> 06:33:54.958 align:start position:0%
these have never been controversial in
 
06:33:56.628 --> 06:33:56.638 align:start position:0%
the past but they began worrying about
 
06:33:58.548 --> 06:33:58.558 align:start position:0%
the copyright and some members of the
 
06:34:00.070 --> 06:34:00.080 align:start position:0%
committee were upset that she might be
 
06:34:01.670 --> 06:34:01.680 align:start position:0%
making royalties off it even though
 
06:34:03.510 --> 06:34:03.520 align:start position:0%
those are oh she's a professional
 
06:34:05.030 --> 06:34:05.040 align:start position:0%
songwriter that is how she makes her
 
06:34:06.548 --> 06:34:06.558 align:start position:0%
living but
 
06:34:06.558 --> 06:34:07.510 align:start position:0%
living but
the

06:34:07.510 --> 06:34:07.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:34:09.030 --> 06:34:09.040 align:start position:0%
i didn't see a problem with they're
 
06:34:10.628 --> 06:34:10.638 align:start position:0%
getting the royalties i just felt like
 
06:34:11.750 --> 06:34:11.760 align:start position:0%
the correct
 
06:34:13.430 --> 06:34:13.440 align:start position:0%
the correct way to deal with this would
 
06:34:15.110 --> 06:34:15.120 align:start position:0%
have been to introduce another bill
 
06:34:16.948 --> 06:34:16.958 align:start position:0%
making it adding it to the list of state
 
06:34:19.670 --> 06:34:19.680 align:start position:0%
songs rather than um
 
06:34:21.510 --> 06:34:21.520 align:start position:0%
rather than as resolutions although i
 
06:34:22.868 --> 06:34:22.878 align:start position:0%
can't necessarily guarantee i won't
 
06:34:24.230 --> 06:34:24.240 align:start position:0%
change my mind the resolution because
 
06:34:26.708 --> 06:34:26.718 align:start position:0%
italians are making the floor because
 
06:34:29.110 --> 06:34:29.120 align:start position:0%
um represent representative nicole knox
 
06:34:30.708 --> 06:34:30.718 align:start position:0%
murphy is she's a very talented
 
06:34:32.150 --> 06:34:32.160 align:start position:0%
singer-songwriter as far as to know
 
06:34:33.910 --> 06:34:33.920 align:start position:0%
she's a very nice person
 
06:34:35.270 --> 06:34:35.280 align:start position:0%
and she would
 
06:34:36.868 --> 06:34:36.878 align:start position:0%
place in a rather awkward position by
 
06:34:38.708 --> 06:34:38.718 align:start position:0%
this hearing they're supposed to be uh
 
06:34:40.070 --> 06:34:40.080 align:start position:0%
you know routine and suddenly they're
 
06:34:42.070 --> 06:34:42.080 align:start position:0%
arguing about like her making money off
 
06:34:43.750 --> 06:34:43.760 align:start position:0%
the song and the copyright and all kinds
 
06:34:45.510 --> 06:34:45.520 align:start position:0%
of really
 
06:34:45.520 --> 06:34:46.390 align:start position:0%
of really
um

06:34:46.390 --> 06:34:46.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:34:48.390 --> 06:34:48.400 align:start position:0%
i just felt like they should have uh
 
06:34:49.590 --> 06:34:49.600 align:start position:0%
they should have probably recessed that
 
06:34:51.830 --> 06:34:51.840 align:start position:0%
particular hearing and done more uh done
 
06:34:53.670 --> 06:34:53.680 align:start position:0%
more research on it and this was in
 
06:34:54.868 --> 06:34:54.878 align:start position:0%
another committee that you were not
 
06:34:55.910 --> 06:34:55.920 align:start position:0%
sharing so i'm sure you would have
 
06:34:57.750 --> 06:34:57.760 align:start position:0%
handled it differently mr chair so
 
06:34:59.350 --> 06:34:59.360 align:start position:0%
that's uh
 
06:35:01.030 --> 06:35:01.040 align:start position:0%
basically why i checked it off i
 
06:35:02.468 --> 06:35:02.478 align:start position:0%
certainly have nothing against the uh
 
06:35:04.070 --> 06:35:04.080 align:start position:0%
the song itself if you look it up on
 
06:35:05.750 --> 06:35:05.760 align:start position:0%
youtube it's it's as i said it's a very
 
06:35:07.510 --> 06:35:07.520 align:start position:0%
catchy song it's a lovely tribute to the
 
06:35:09.110 --> 06:35:09.120 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire and i'm sure
 
06:35:12.708 --> 06:35:12.718 align:start position:0%
everyone on the committee will enjoy it
 
06:35:12.718 --> 06:35:14.150 align:start position:0%
everyone on the committee will enjoy it
so

06:35:14.150 --> 06:35:14.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:35:16.868 --> 06:35:16.878 align:start position:0%
all set yes um will you accept a
 
06:35:16.878 --> 06:35:17.750 align:start position:0%
all set yes um will you accept a
question

06:35:17.750 --> 06:35:17.760 align:start position:0%
question
 
06:35:20.868 --> 06:35:20.878 align:start position:0%
no okay um i have one question yeah this
 
06:35:23.350 --> 06:35:23.360 align:start position:0%
this um so you if i understood you
 
06:35:25.830 --> 06:35:25.840 align:start position:0%
correctly you're saying that the correct
 
06:35:25.840 --> 06:35:27.030 align:start position:0%
correctly you're saying that the correct
way

06:35:27.030 --> 06:35:27.040 align:start position:0%
way
 
06:35:28.788 --> 06:35:28.798 align:start position:0%
rather than doing a concurrent
 
06:35:30.708 --> 06:35:30.718 align:start position:0%
resolution is
 
06:35:32.868 --> 06:35:32.878 align:start position:0%
or is it a concurrent resolution still
 
06:35:35.350 --> 06:35:35.360 align:start position:0%
to be able to add this
 
06:35:35.360 --> 06:35:36.230 align:start position:0%
to be able to add this
to

06:35:36.230 --> 06:35:36.240 align:start position:0%
to
 
06:35:39.110 --> 06:35:39.120 align:start position:0%
um one of this official state songs is
 
06:35:40.628 --> 06:35:40.638 align:start position:0%
that what you're saying i don't know
 
06:35:42.548 --> 06:35:42.558 align:start position:0%
whether we could i mean
 
06:35:44.230 --> 06:35:44.240 align:start position:0%
you could speak is that what you said i
 
06:35:45.510 --> 06:35:45.520 align:start position:0%
think you're just to put words in your
 
06:35:46.948 --> 06:35:46.958 align:start position:0%
mouth i think just expressing your
 
06:35:49.510 --> 06:35:49.520 align:start position:0%
appreciation so i'm not sure whether hcr
 
06:35:50.948 --> 06:35:50.958 align:start position:0%
would be the way to add her to the list
 
06:35:53.030 --> 06:35:53.040 align:start position:0%
of state songs which i think it deserves
 
06:35:54.788 --> 06:35:54.798 align:start position:0%
to be on um
 
06:35:56.948 --> 06:35:56.958 align:start position:0%
i mean you can try yeah you can try
 
06:35:59.030 --> 06:35:59.040 align:start position:0%
writing it that way and see see if the
 
06:36:01.190 --> 06:36:01.200 align:start position:0%
clerk and everybody else involves
 
06:36:02.628 --> 06:36:02.638 align:start position:0%
if it passes muster with them but i
 
06:36:02.638 --> 06:36:03.830 align:start position:0%
if it passes muster with them but i
think

06:36:03.830 --> 06:36:03.840 align:start position:0%
think
 
06:36:05.430 --> 06:36:05.440 align:start position:0%
house bill should have been introduced
 
06:36:07.510 --> 06:36:07.520 align:start position:0%
to correct the error or so
 
06:36:11.350 --> 06:36:11.360 align:start position:0%
and fine i'm set anyone
 
06:36:12.868 --> 06:36:12.878 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your testimony
 
06:36:14.230 --> 06:36:14.240 align:start position:0%
making a big fuss over nothing but
 
06:36:16.230 --> 06:36:16.240 align:start position:0%
thanks for giving me like two minutes so
 
06:36:24.628 --> 06:36:24.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:36:29.070 --> 06:36:29.080 align:start position:0%
with that i will close the hearing on
 
06:36:29.080 --> 06:36:30.788 align:start position:0%
with that i will close the hearing on
hcr9

hcr9
 
06:36:30.798 --> 06:36:31.830 align:start position:0%
hcr9
and

06:36:31.830 --> 06:36:31.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:36:34.310 --> 06:36:34.320 align:start position:0%
i think we're done
 
06:36:36.708 --> 06:36:36.718 align:start position:0%
we went through i think we have now the
 
06:36:36.718 --> 06:36:38.150 align:start position:0%
we went through i think we have now the
record

06:36:38.150 --> 06:36:38.160 align:start position:0%
record
 
06:36:40.830 --> 06:36:40.840 align:start position:0%
we went through 17 bills
 
06:36:45.510 --> 06:36:45.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:36:47.030 --> 06:36:47.040 align:start position:0%
thank you for everything
 
06:36:50.548 --> 06:36:50.558 align:start position:0%
folks um as far as my understanding my
 
06:36:52.070 --> 06:36:52.080 align:start position:0%
intention here
 
06:36:52.080 --> 06:36:58.548 align:start position:0%
intention here
um

06:36:58.548 --> 06:36:58.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:37:01.430 --> 06:37:01.440 align:start position:0%
my intention is to um
 
06:37:04.548 --> 06:37:04.558 align:start position:0%
begin the process of executing
 
06:37:07.270 --> 06:37:07.280 align:start position:0%
these bills plus the cacrs
 
06:37:07.280 --> 06:37:08.468 align:start position:0%
these bills plus the cacrs
um

06:37:08.468 --> 06:37:08.478 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:37:12.150 --> 06:37:12.160 align:start position:0%
i'm hopeful that we have
 
06:37:14.548 --> 06:37:14.558 align:start position:0%
more than just uh one two
 
06:37:17.750 --> 06:37:17.760 align:start position:0%
seven of us um doing the lion's share of
 
06:37:20.070 --> 06:37:20.080 align:start position:0%
the work here um
 
06:37:23.510 --> 06:37:23.520 align:start position:0%
i'm hopeful that um we are able to split
 
06:37:26.070 --> 06:37:26.080 align:start position:0%
the workload and so you know we're not
 
06:37:26.080 --> 06:37:27.670 align:start position:0%
the workload and so you know we're not
doing

06:37:27.670 --> 06:37:27.680 align:start position:0%
doing
 
06:37:27.680 --> 06:37:29.110 align:start position:0%
doing
multiple

06:37:29.110 --> 06:37:29.120 align:start position:0%
multiple
 
06:37:32.868 --> 06:37:32.878 align:start position:0%
committee reports as we go
 
06:37:34.628 --> 06:37:34.638 align:start position:0%
the ranking member and i will have a
 
06:37:36.628 --> 06:37:36.638 align:start position:0%
conversation i'm sure in the next few
 
06:37:39.350 --> 06:37:39.360 align:start position:0%
days about where we stand on on some of
 
06:37:41.590 --> 06:37:41.600 align:start position:0%
these and whether we can
 
06:37:43.910 --> 06:37:43.920 align:start position:0%
i'm sure there's a number of these that
 
06:37:47.510 --> 06:37:47.520 align:start position:0%
will be on consent one way or the other
 
06:37:49.270 --> 06:37:49.280 align:start position:0%
but i um
 
06:37:53.190 --> 06:37:53.200 align:start position:0%
i'm looking again at next wednesday
 
06:37:53.200 --> 06:37:54.230 align:start position:0%
i'm looking again at next wednesday
for

06:37:54.230 --> 06:37:54.240 align:start position:0%
for
 
06:37:56.548 --> 06:37:56.558 align:start position:0%
a morning
 
06:37:59.190 --> 06:37:59.200 align:start position:0%
sorry about that um
 
06:38:01.110 --> 06:38:01.120 align:start position:0%
for a morning you have hearings next
 
06:38:02.468 --> 06:38:02.478 align:start position:0%
month next
 
06:38:02.478 --> 06:38:12.868 align:start position:0%
month next
wednesday

06:38:12.868 --> 06:38:12.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:38:16.390 --> 06:38:16.400 align:start position:0%
there isn't any really other day
 
06:38:20.230 --> 06:38:20.240 align:start position:0%
that i know of that would work
 
06:38:20.240 --> 06:38:21.350 align:start position:0%
that i know of that would work
um

06:38:21.350 --> 06:38:21.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:38:23.750 --> 06:38:23.760 align:start position:0%
so i'm going to suggest that we probably
 
06:38:25.830 --> 06:38:25.840 align:start position:0%
will start seeing um
 
06:38:27.830 --> 06:38:27.840 align:start position:0%
look in the calendar i'm going to try to
 
06:38:30.628 --> 06:38:30.638 align:start position:0%
get it in for next week for
 
06:38:32.468 --> 06:38:32.478 align:start position:0%
again nine o'clock
 
06:38:34.548 --> 06:38:34.558 align:start position:0%
i don't know how long it'll take but i
 
06:38:36.548 --> 06:38:36.558 align:start position:0%
think we should be able to knock it off
 
06:38:38.628 --> 06:38:38.638 align:start position:0%
and then we'll be done um until
 
06:38:38.638 --> 06:38:40.310 align:start position:0%
and then we'll be done um until
crossover

06:38:40.310 --> 06:38:40.320 align:start position:0%
crossover
 
06:38:44.150 --> 06:38:44.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:38:56.150 --> 06:38:56.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:38:58.548 --> 06:38:58.558 align:start position:0%
well before you get there we only we
 
06:38:58.558 --> 06:38:59.590 align:start position:0%
well before you get there we only we
don't

06:38:59.590 --> 06:38:59.600 align:start position:0%
don't
 
06:39:02.230 --> 06:39:02.240 align:start position:0%
we don't own this room
 
06:39:05.110 --> 06:39:05.120 align:start position:0%
we share this with municipal and county
 
06:39:06.948 --> 06:39:06.958 align:start position:0%
and and
 
06:39:08.708 --> 06:39:08.718 align:start position:0%
environment and ag
 
06:39:11.590 --> 06:39:11.600 align:start position:0%
i don't know whether
 
06:39:13.030 --> 06:39:13.040 align:start position:0%
i would have to talk with the other
 
06:39:13.040 --> 06:39:14.708 align:start position:0%
i would have to talk with the other
chairs

06:39:14.708 --> 06:39:14.718 align:start position:0%
chairs
 
06:39:18.070 --> 06:39:18.080 align:start position:0%
i don't know have you spoken to your
 
06:39:19.430 --> 06:39:19.440 align:start position:0%
caucus whether
 
06:39:21.990 --> 06:39:22.000 align:start position:0%
even another day other than wednesday is
 
06:39:22.000 --> 06:39:24.230 align:start position:0%
even another day other than wednesday is
possible

06:39:24.230 --> 06:39:24.240 align:start position:0%
possible
 
06:39:27.430 --> 06:39:27.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:39:36.230 --> 06:39:36.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:39:36.240 --> 06:39:37.270 align:start position:0%
 
okay

now we wouldn't be able to he's in the
