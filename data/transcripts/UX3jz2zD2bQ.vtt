Good morning, everyone.

14
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:38.500
We've reached the lonely time of the year when many people are around still trying to put finishing touches on pieces of what's going on.

15
00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:43.000
So you notice that the table is remarkably empty.

16
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Thank heavens, Representative Umberger didn't want me to be alone.

LBA came up.

They didn't want me to be alone.

20
00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:08.500
We are going to take a break, and I would ask LBA to post that until 11 o'clock this morning.

Are we recording?

314
00:12:00.500 --> 00:12:02.500
Excellent.

315
00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:08.500
Welcome to the committee conference on House Bill 2 one more time.

316
00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:20.000
Would LBA passed out amendment number 2 0 2 1 dash 2 0 4 1 H in the name of Representative Packard, please.

317
00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.500
Okay, just now on the other side.

318
00:12:23.500 --> 00:12:26.500
I know we're doing this first.

319
00:12:26.500 --> 00:12:28.500
Mr.

320
00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:32.000
Speaker, how would you like to proceed?

321
00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:40.500
Do you want LBA to run through the changes or would you like to do that, sir?

322
00:12:40.500 --> 00:12:46.000
LBA, can you run through the changes in this amendment, please?

323
00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000
Sure.

324
00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:59.500
Amendment number 2041H is similar to an amendment that was adopted by the committee yesterday relative to emergency powers with two main changes.

325
00:12:59.500 --> 00:13:06.500
On page one on row 21, you will see a reference to subparagraph D.

326
00:13:06.500 --> 00:13:10.000
Everything prior to that is the same.

327
00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:21.000
Everything on the bottom of page one from lines 25 through 32 continued over through page two, row three are the same.

328
00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:39.500
What is new is on beginning on page four, sorry, Beginning on page two, line four, subparagraph D, which is a new subsection, which states 90 days from the date of declaration of a state of emergency.

329
00:13:39.500 --> 00:14:03.500
And every 90 days thereafter, the governor shall call pursuant to part two, article 50 of the New Hampshire Constitution, and address a joint session of the General Court and shall provide a written copy of the address to all members of both chambers within five business days.

330
00:14:03.500 --> 00:14:20.500
At such joint session, the legislature shall either affirm the renewal or terminate the state of emergency by concurrent resolution adopted by a simple majority of both chambers acting separately on the following question.

331
00:14:20.500 --> 00:14:24.500
Shall the current state of emergency be continued?

332
00:14:24.500 --> 00:14:33.500
For purposes of this section, simple majority means a majority of members presenting voting, yay, in both chambers.

333
00:14:33.500 --> 00:14:50.000
Note, and then we get to line 13, that is the relative to the fiscal committee, approval and accept and expands, as well as the exemption of the legislature to conduct their business.

334
00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:55.000
No changes for yesterday's amendment from lines 13 through 28.

335
00:14:55.000 --> 00:15:02.500
There is also no changes from yesterday's amendment on line 29, section 461 through 33.

336
00:15:02.500 --> 00:15:05.500
On line 34, this is new.

337
00:15:05.500 --> 00:15:35.500
This is a severability section, which states, beginning on line 34 on page 2, if any provision of RSA 445 as amended by this Act is declared unconstitutional or the applicability thereof to any person or circumstances held invalid, The constitutionality of the remainder RSA 445 and the applicability thereof to other persons in circumstances shall not be affected thereby.

338
00:15:35.500 --> 00:15:47.000
And then the effective date on page three has just been adjusted accordingly to take into account the new section which was added.

339
00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.000
Thank you, Mr.

340
00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.000
King.

341
00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:57.000
I will say the House position, which is quite a strong position.

342
00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:04.000
We had this in a bill we had on the floor in the House.

343
00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:10.500
And we had approximately 350 people vote in the affirmative to this language.

344
00:16:10.500 --> 00:16:35.000
it was not partisan language it was bipartisan we strongly supported this language mr speaker would you like to speak in favor of your amendment no is there is there any discussion on the amendment we're in a time crunch do we have a motion motion on the amendment.

345
00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:46.000
Representative umberger moves the adoption of amendment to zero to one dash to zero for one H represent Weiler seconds that motion.

346
00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.000
See no hands up.

347
00:16:48.000 --> 00:17:10.000
If the House is in favor favor would they please raise their hands for adopting the amendment we voted unanimously mr senate president senator favor senator the post the vote on this adoption is five to three one to zero Well, one to zero.

348
00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:12.500
We should get one vote.

349
00:17:12.500 --> 00:17:14.500
Thank you.

350
00:17:14.500 --> 00:17:17.000
I've been calling the vote.

351
00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:19.000
one to zero.

352
00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:21.000
Well, one to zero.

353
00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:23.500
We should get one vote.

354
00:17:23.500 --> 00:17:25.500
Thank you.

355
00:17:25.500 --> 00:17:30.000
I've been calling the votes wrong for three days.

356
00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.500
Okay, it only matters today.

357
00:17:32.500 --> 00:17:34.500
Senator Bradley.

358
00:17:34.500 --> 00:17:36.500
Yes.

359
00:17:36.500 --> 00:17:38.500
Thank you, Mickey.

360
00:17:38.500 --> 00:17:45.000
Would you like to speak to your amendment or would you like Mr.

361
00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:47.000
Kane?

362
00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:49.000
Okay.

363
00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:51.000
Senator Bradley.

364
00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:53.500
So everybody got this amendment.

365
00:17:53.500 --> 00:18:03.000
Okay, so this builds upon the language that speaker Packard just gave us, but let me walk through it.

366
00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:11.000
There is a change on the first page of the amendment in lines 17 and 18.

367
00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:42.000
the duration of the state of emergency would be set back to the statutory construct right now 21 days as opposed to 30 days so we're going we're shrinking the duration back to 21 days I believe this was something that uh representative Edwards brought to me this morning and I think it is sent it's meant to constrain a governor's authority.

368
00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:44.000
What line was that?

369
00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:54.500
That was page one, starts on 17, where it said 30 days, now 21 days, 18, 30 days, now 21 days.

370
00:18:54.500 --> 00:19:01.500
30 days was a change, 21 days existing language is that correct that's correct.

371
00:19:01.500 --> 00:19:03.500
We.

372
00:19:03.500 --> 00:19:15.000
I am proposing on line three through 11 to incorporate virtually all of the speakers land I think we're on page two now.

373
00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:20.000
Yes, I'm sorry ma'am page to line three through 11.

374
00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:22.000
Thank you.

375
00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:25.000
virtually all of the speakers language.

376
00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:28.500
I think we're on page two now.

377
00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:30.500
Yes, I'm sorry, ma'am.

378
00:19:30.500 --> 00:19:33.500
Page two, line three through 11.

379
00:19:33.500 --> 00:20:02.500
The change drops the words in the speaker's amendment shall affirm on line seven shall either affirm the renewal or terminate the state of emergency and substitutes the legislature shall vote on whether to terminate the state of emergency so i think some i think what both myself and the speaker are trying to accomplish is the following.

380
00:20:02.500 --> 00:20:21.500
If there's a state of emergency in the state of New Hampshire, within 90 days, a governor would have to come before a joint session under Part 2, Article 50, and address both chambers in a joint session.

381
00:20:21.500 --> 00:20:27.500
That is intended to provide transparency and accountability of an emergency order.

382
00:20:27.500 --> 00:20:34.000
And then the legislature under this language shall vote on whether to terminate.

383
00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:57.000
The rationale behind voting to terminate as opposed to affirm or terminate is the constitutional check and balance that we have in the state of New Hampshire under our Constitution, that one body of the legislature, either the House or the Senate, cannot override by itself.

384
00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:02.000
And those are the traditional and constitutional checks and balances.

385
00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:15.000
So if we have, as proposed on line seven, there has to be an affirmative vote and it has to be on whether it will terminate.

386
00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:30.000
And that is, I hope the rationale and an acceptable way forward that provides the kind of transparency and accountability that I think all eight of us feel is necessary.

387
00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:34.500
And it maintains our traditional constitutional checks and balances.

388
00:21:34.500 --> 00:21:48.500
And lastly, the only, and it's really not a change, but it's a change from our amendment of yesterday, the severability clause at the bottom of the page.

389
00:21:48.500 --> 00:21:51.500
And that's there for obvious reasons.

390
00:21:51.500 --> 00:21:54.000
So thank you, Madam Chair.

391
00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:56.000
You're welcome.

392
00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:58.000
Seeing no discussion.

393
00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:00.000
Is there a motion?

394
00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:02.500
I will move the amendment.

395
00:22:02.500 --> 00:22:09.000
Senator Bradley moves amendment 2 0 2 1 2 0 4 2 S.

396
00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:11.500
Senator Morse seconds that motion.

397
00:22:11.500 --> 00:22:16.500
The House, if you're in favor, please raise your hands.

398
00:22:16.500 --> 00:22:19.000
We are not in favor.

399
00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:22.500
Senator Morse, how does the Senate vote?

400
00:22:22.500 --> 00:22:28.000
As I've just learned, the vote now is zero to one.

401
00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:30.000
Is that correct?

402
00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:44.000
It's two, which is exactly what this language that Senator Bradley presents would accomplish, because in the language the Speaker presented, one body can overrule the other body.

403
00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:48.500
We will be, by vote, going with Amendment 2-0-2-1-2-0-4-1-H.

404
00:22:48.500 --> 00:22:51.000
I have one more item.

405
00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:53.000
Mr.

406
00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:57.500
Cain, I'm on page 299 of the compare report.

407
00:22:57.500 --> 00:23:03.500
And I have what I think is going to be 299 correct?

408
00:23:03.500 --> 00:23:08.000
I said 299 I hope did I say 299?

409
00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:10.000
I believe it.

410
00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:12.000
Okay, now it's 299.

411
00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:15.000
No matter what I said before.

412
00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:19.000
In the bottom paragraph on section 356, Mr.

413
00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:26.000
Kane, yesterday, I believe we moved that LBA could provide technical and maintenance corrections.

414
00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:35.000
We would like the first date of January 1, 2022 to be moved to be March 31, 2022.

415
00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:37.000
299 represent Bumberger.

416
00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:41.000
We're in section 21 dash I colon 108.

417
00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:45.000
The second date, which is October 1st, 2022.

418
00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:49.500
We would like that moved to January 1st, 2023.

419
00:23:49.500 --> 00:24:32.500
And I believe representative Edwards is going to be moving to the table in favor of representative Turcotte is that correct mr speaker this is a technical change does someone in the house move this technical change second representative umberger moves the approval of those two dates as read represent weiler seconds that motion second sooner or more seconds the motion we're going to put the vote with the House, please vote if you are in favor of having LBA make those technical changes for us.

420
00:24:32.500 --> 00:24:34.500
We are unanimous.

421
00:24:34.500 --> 00:24:43.000
This vote would be two to nothing now that I've correctly learned how to call the vote.

422
00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:46.500
See, old dogs can learn new tricks.

423
00:24:46.500 --> 00:24:49.000
I am a cat person.

424
00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:51.000
Definitely.

425
00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:54.500
Old cats can learn new tricks too.

426
00:24:54.500 --> 00:25:01.500
At this point in time, we have concluded the work we're going to do.

427
00:25:01.500 --> 00:25:05.500
Senator Morris, would you like to say something?

428
00:25:05.500 --> 00:25:37.000
Well, i think the senate and lba wants to clarify where we are on the two no votes we just had and what's in the budget yes just to clarify based on the actions taken by the the two bodies on the two amendments offered today and the emergency orders And there was not a reconsideration of the vote on 2017 from yesterday.

429
00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:39.500
We're going to maintain 2017.

430
00:25:39.500 --> 00:25:45.000
We just wanted to make sure that the committee understands that.

431
00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:47.000
Is that correct?

432
00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:49.000
No, I'm sorry, Mike.

433
00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:51.000
Okay.

434
00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:54.500
I thought that 2041 actually says replace.

435
00:25:54.500 --> 00:26:01.500
So that may be my fault because the OLS had replaced at the top.

436
00:26:01.500 --> 00:26:07.500
So we are actually is there a motion to to reconsider 217.

437
00:26:07.500 --> 00:26:09.500
2041 did not pass.

438
00:26:09.500 --> 00:26:11.500
So that was why.

439
00:26:11.500 --> 00:26:13.500
According to the clerk.

440
00:26:13.500 --> 00:26:19.000
The chair can say if it will go into the report.

441
00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:21.000
Okay.

442
00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:23.000
Okay.

443
00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:25.000
So we'll put 204.1.H.

444
00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:28.500
I've had a parliamentary lesson today also.

445
00:26:28.500 --> 00:26:31.500
More than I wanted to have.

446
00:26:31.500 --> 00:26:33.500
Thank you.

447
00:26:33.500 --> 00:26:35.500
Okay, sure.

448
00:26:35.500 --> 00:26:38.000
The Senate asking for recess.

449
00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:40.000
A break.

450
00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:42.000
Right.

451
00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:44.000
Right.

452
00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:46.000
Recess.

453
00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:50.000
We're going to take a 10 minute recess.

454
00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:52.000
I'm sorry.

455
00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:54.000
Break.

456
00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:56.500
I repeated Senator Morrison's words.

457
00:26:56.500 --> 00:26:58.500
Thank you.

458
00:26:58.500 --> 00:27:00.500
Thank you.

459
00:27:00.500 --> 00:27:02.500
Thank you.

460
00:27:02.500 --> 00:27:04.500
Thank you.

461
00:27:04.500 --> 00:27:06.500
Thank you.

462
00:27:06.500 --> 00:27:08.500
Thank you.

463
00:27:08.500 --> 00:27:10.500
Thank you.

464
00:27:10.500 --> 00:27:12.500
Thank you.

465
00:27:12.500 --> 00:27:14.500
Thank you.

466
00:27:14.500 --> 00:27:29.500
I think the record has been actually called out on another thing and we're going to ask Representative Emmerich who is one of our assigned alternates to sitting with us.

467
00:27:29.500 --> 00:27:43.500
Senator Morris, when you raised your hand, I thought you were going to ask me if the House was acceding to the Senate on sections 356 to 361.

468
00:27:43.500 --> 00:27:50.500
I'd be happy to ask you if the House is acceding to the Senate.

469
00:27:50.500 --> 00:27:56.000
If the House is acceding, would you please raise your hand?

470
00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:58.000
Yes, sir, we are.

471
00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:00.000
Thank you.

472
00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:02.000
You're welcome.

473
00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:06.000
And I'm sorry I thought you were not.

474
00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:13.500
I didn't realize you were still too back I wanted to finish that particular thing.

475
00:28:13.500 --> 00:28:42.000
Senator Bradley, the House, if you don't mind, would like to ask that you re that we reconsider your amendment 2042 and ask you a couple of questions would that be acceptable absolutely um one of the things that got changed and i'm not certain i understand why is line nine the current state of emergency question.

476
00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:55.500
And can you just explain that to me in the hall when I ask you, but could you explain to all of us again why that changed?

477
00:28:55.500 --> 00:28:57.500
To line nine?

478
00:28:57.500 --> 00:29:00.500
Page two, line nine, yes, sir.

479
00:29:00.500 --> 00:29:29.000
So because of the way that the construct is that in line seven, the legislature shall vote on whether to terminate, the question has to be, shall the current state of emergency be terminated to keep it consistent with, as I said before, the checks and balances and the constitutional requirement that both bodies take an action.

480
00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:32.500
And the action would be to terminate.

481
00:29:32.500 --> 00:29:43.000
So that actually gives us the affirmative vote we were looking to ask and we misunderstood what was in your amendment?

482
00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:46.000
To terminate an emergency order, yes.

483
00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:48.000
Okay.

484
00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:50.500
Thank you for that explanation.

485
00:29:50.500 --> 00:30:17.500
I'll move to adopt amendment 2042 representative weiler moves to adopt amendment 2021-2042s senator daniels seconds okay now i wrote the vote on here before any more discussion seeing none is the House in favor of the motion to adopt to zero to one dash to oh four to West please raise your hand.

486
00:30:17.500 --> 00:30:21.500
Okay, we had different outcome when we understood.

487
00:30:21.500 --> 00:30:23.500
All right, Mr.

488
00:30:23.500 --> 00:30:25.500
Cain.

489
00:30:25.500 --> 00:30:32.000
I think now we understand we should have had a little more discussion.

490
00:30:32.000 --> 00:31:20.000
We have now adopted 2021-2042s yes we do not want to have the motion the amendment we had yesterday do we have to move to reconsider both that down or can you take it out and because again this says replace we will replace what you did yesterday and this will replace it in its entirety okay and that's acceptable yes Mr alakonis will bring over the sign-off sheet so we can sign it off right here ah service with a smile we normally get a complete version of house bill 2 with everything in it.

491
00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:23.500
However, we've made a couple of changes.

492
00:31:23.500 --> 00:31:34.500
Is the committee comfortable allowing LBA to add that amendment, make the changes, and for us to vote off at this time?

493
00:31:34.500 --> 00:31:36.500
I am, yes.

494
00:31:36.500 --> 00:31:42.500
Do we have a motion to adopt House Bill 202 as amended?

495
00:31:42.500 --> 00:31:44.500
So moved.

496
00:31:44.500 --> 00:31:46.500
Second.

497
00:31:46.500 --> 00:31:56.000
Representative Weiler moves, so no more seconds to adopt House Bill 2 as amended by this Committee of Conference.

498
00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:01.000
If this House is in favor, please raise your hand.

499
00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:31.500
Is the Senate in oh yippee two to nothing now that i've learned to call the vote correctly she she could have told me the first day you know i could have done that right all along um i guess mr kane we have arrived at the end i can tell you that this has been hard for all of us.

500
00:32:31.500 --> 00:32:33.500
It takes a village.

501
00:32:33.500 --> 00:32:37.000
It started in March for the House.

502
00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:43.500
Division one would not have made it without Mike Hoffman and Nancy Levinas.

503
00:32:43.500 --> 00:32:46.000
We had over 100 amendments.

504
00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:48.500
We wouldn't have made it.

505
00:32:48.500 --> 00:32:53.500
But I know Karen speaks the same way about Mickey.

506
00:32:53.500 --> 00:33:01.000
And Kevin Ripple used to work with Division I before he went to Division III.

507
00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:05.500
And Jess Edwards quickly learned how valuable he was.

508
00:33:05.500 --> 00:33:07.500
Mr.

509
00:33:07.500 --> 00:33:09.500
Cain and Mr.

510
00:33:09.500 --> 00:33:12.500
Shea, your team has been wonderful.

511
00:33:12.500 --> 00:33:19.500
And I would like to give you a standing ovation from all of us.

512
00:33:19.500 --> 00:33:23.500
We always wanted to thank people from OLS.

513
00:33:23.500 --> 00:33:29.500
Janet Klayman, our secretary, we almost have to put shackles on her.

514
00:33:29.500 --> 00:33:31.500
Is she in there?

515
00:33:31.500 --> 00:33:33.500
No, she's left.

516
00:33:33.500 --> 00:33:37.500
She does this to us all the time.

517
00:33:37.500 --> 00:33:40.500
She hates to have the knowledge.

518
00:33:40.500 --> 00:33:46.500
She doesn't want to have her hand in here, but I can.

519
00:33:46.500 --> 00:33:48.500
Janet.

520
00:33:48.500 --> 00:33:50.500
Okay, Janet.

521
00:33:50.500 --> 00:34:00.000
from a house perspective and i have a feeling Senator Morris would and Senator Daniels would concur with this.

522
00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:06.500
We had a great deal of help from the budget director, Matt Malou.

523
00:34:06.500 --> 00:34:13.500
He was just instrumental, answered technical questions, helped with wording when we had questions.

524
00:34:13.500 --> 00:34:15.500
Chris Elm came over.

525
00:34:15.500 --> 00:34:22.000
We had committee chairman from many of the standing committees in the House.

526
00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:26.500
It really takes a village to get this done.

527
00:34:26.500 --> 00:34:45.500
Aaron Goulet, our chief of staff, I know Deb Vanderbeek, the Senate chief of staff, and Josh Elliott, the deputy on the Senate, Deborah Childs, the deputy on our side, helped in innumerable ways that you cannot imagine.

528
00:34:45.500 --> 00:34:48.500
We've done a fiscally balanced budget.

529
00:34:48.500 --> 00:34:53.000
We have a lot of positive things in here.

530
00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:56.000
We had more agreement than disagreement.

531
00:34:56.000 --> 00:35:02.000
And we have managed, ladies and gentlemen, to reach the end successfully.

532
00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:04.000
Thank you.

533
00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:06.000
more agreement than disagreement.

534
00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:12.000
And we have managed, ladies and gentlemen, to reach the end successfully.

535
00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:14.000
So thank you.

536
00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:16.000
Thank you.

537
00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:38.000
Before we sign off, I just want to make it clear that the chairman of this committee, and I called and told her this, done an unbelievable job of keeping us in line and running a committee that had a lot to go over.

538
00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:42.000

543
00:35:52.000 --> 00:36:06.000
I think it's really important to cite Representative and all our House colleagues, but Representative Ober, for the honesty, the integrity, the attention to detail that you've brought.

544
00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:19.000

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:50.000
We are done.

548
00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:55.000
We are expecting OLS to come with the sign-off sheet.

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:08.000
Kane, committee conference members may want to have a copy of HB2.

552
00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:10.500
When might that be available?

553

00:37:14.500 --> 00:37:20.000
