00:07:15.430 --> 00:07:15.440 align:start position:0%
this morning it is my intention
 
00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:19.440 align:start position:0%
that we go through both the
 
00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:22.880 align:start position:0%
capital budget compare report the one
 
00:07:23.749 --> 00:07:23.759 align:start position:0%
that is
 
00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:27.360 align:start position:0%
dated 318 21
 
00:07:29.909 --> 00:07:29.919 align:start position:0%
as well as the draft amendment to house
 
00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:32.560 align:start position:0%
bill 25a
 
00:07:34.950 --> 00:07:34.960 align:start position:0%
it is my intention that we finish that
 
00:07:36.710 --> 00:07:36.720 align:start position:0%
work today
 
00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:39.840 align:start position:0%
um so that the drafters and the lba
 
00:07:43.909 --> 00:07:43.919 align:start position:0%
can finish whatever changes we make to
 
00:07:46.469 --> 00:07:46.479 align:start position:0%
the draft amendment
 
00:07:50.230 --> 00:07:50.240 align:start position:0%
to the bill and that on thursday morning
 
00:07:53.110 --> 00:07:53.120 align:start position:0%
we will have the executive session on

house bill 25a
 
00:07:58.309 --> 00:07:58.319 align:start position:0%
so it is imperative that we get this
 
00:07:59.909 --> 00:07:59.919 align:start position:0%
done in order to give
 
00:08:03.270 --> 00:08:03.280 align:start position:0%
uh legislative services and the lba the
 
00:08:04.950 --> 00:08:04.960 align:start position:0%
necessary time
 
00:08:08.550 --> 00:08:08.560 align:start position:0%
to um finalize
 
00:08:12.150 --> 00:08:12.160 align:start position:0%
uh the amendment to this bill
 
00:08:15.350 --> 00:08:15.360 align:start position:0%
because it has to be reported out next
 
00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:16.070 align:start position:0%
because it has to be reported out next
week

00:08:16.070 --> 00:08:16.080 align:start position:0%
week
 
00:08:17.830 --> 00:08:17.840 align:start position:0%
and i don't want to be here monday or
 
00:08:19.909 --> 00:08:19.919 align:start position:0%
tuesday trying to do it
 
00:08:23.029 --> 00:08:23.039 align:start position:0%

to the speaker so with that said
 
00:08:33.350 --> 00:08:33.360 align:start position:0%
um i think that what i would like to do
 
00:08:37.269 --> 00:08:37.279 align:start position:0%
is go through the the compare sheet
 
00:08:40.469 --> 00:08:40.479 align:start position:0%
you all should have had uh gotten a copy
 
00:08:43.829 --> 00:08:43.839 align:start position:0%
if you have not quickly email or
 
00:08:47.590 --> 00:08:47.600 align:start position:0%
something not me but um
 
00:08:50.230 --> 00:08:50.240 align:start position:0%
let it be known now we can get a copy
 
00:08:53.110 --> 00:08:53.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:55.430 --> 00:08:55.440 align:start position:0%
if if i could have a copy sent to me sir
 
00:08:57.110 --> 00:08:57.120 align:start position:0%
i i have not been able to find it it's
 
00:09:00.150 --> 00:09:00.160 align:start position:0%

mr shea can you do that i will i'll do
 
00:09:04.150 --> 00:09:04.160 align:start position:0%
it right now is there anybody else who

00:09:07.670 --> 00:09:07.680 align:start position:0%
out to the entire committee
 
00:09:11.030 --> 00:09:11.040 align:start position:0%

go ahead and send it to all
 
00:09:17.670 --> 00:09:17.680 align:start position:0%
but make sure that uh representative
 
00:09:20.790 --> 00:09:20.800 align:start position:0%
grassy is included because he's not
 
00:09:23.110 --> 00:09:23.120 align:start position:0%
he's become a full-time member but he's
 
00:09:30.389 --> 00:09:30.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:31.910 --> 00:09:31.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for that consideration mr
 
00:09:34.790 --> 00:09:34.800 align:start position:0%
chairman nice community
 
00:09:38.070 --> 00:09:38.080 align:start position:0%
this is one of the disadvantages of
 
00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:38.790 align:start position:0%
this is one of the disadvantages of
meeting

00:09:38.790 --> 00:09:38.800 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
00:09:42.470 --> 00:09:42.480 align:start position:0%
um either by a zoom or in a hybrid
 
00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:43.350 align:start position:0%
um either by a zoom or in a hybrid
setting

00:09:43.350 --> 00:09:43.360 align:start position:0%
setting
 
00:09:45.269 --> 00:09:45.279 align:start position:0%
is you have to make sure that the paper
 
00:09:46.790 --> 00:09:46.800 align:start position:0%
is to everybody
 
00:09:49.509 --> 00:09:49.519 align:start position:0%
at least electronically so that we're
 
00:09:52.550 --> 00:09:52.560 align:start position:0%
all talking off of the same piece of
 
00:09:58.389 --> 00:09:58.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:01.750 --> 00:10:01.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:04.870 --> 00:10:04.880 align:start position:0%
what we tentatively agreed to at our
 
00:10:06.310 --> 00:10:06.320 align:start position:0%
last work sessions
 
00:10:08.790 --> 00:10:08.800 align:start position:0%
so i think that it is important that we
 
00:10:10.389 --> 00:10:10.399 align:start position:0%
go through it again
 
00:10:13.750 --> 00:10:13.760 align:start position:0%
and then go through the
 
00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:21.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:25.269 --> 00:10:25.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:27.269 --> 00:10:27.279 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure how fast everybody's
 
00:10:28.389 --> 00:10:28.399 align:start position:0%
internet is
 
00:10:31.110 --> 00:10:31.120 align:start position:0%
so wait a minute i know in mind it
 
00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:31.750 align:start position:0%
so wait a minute i know in mind it
sometimes

00:10:31.750 --> 00:10:31.760 align:start position:0%
sometimes
 
00:10:35.910 --> 00:10:35.920 align:start position:0%
takes a moment or two for it to
 
00:10:48.870 --> 00:10:48.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:52.310 --> 00:10:52.320 align:start position:0%
okay um
 
00:10:56.630 --> 00:10:56.640 align:start position:0%
we shall proceed working off of
 
00:10:59.990 --> 00:11:00.000 align:start position:0%
the uh the compare report um
 
00:11:03.910 --> 00:11:03.920 align:start position:0%
on for date of 318 2021
 
00:11:06.310 --> 00:11:06.320 align:start position:0%
and i believe for those who are in
 
00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:07.990 align:start position:0%
and i believe for those who are in
attendance

00:11:07.990 --> 00:11:08.000 align:start position:0%
attendance
 
00:11:11.430 --> 00:11:11.440 align:start position:0%
um mr shea this is on uh your
 
00:11:17.110 --> 00:11:17.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:19.910 --> 00:11:19.920 align:start position:0%
yes it should be out there okay thank
 
00:11:21.590 --> 00:11:21.600 align:start position:0%

all right department of admin services
 
00:11:29.190 --> 00:11:29.200 align:start position:0%
the only change that we have made to
 
00:11:31.509 --> 00:11:31.519 align:start position:0%
that request from the governor is to
 
00:11:31.519 --> 00:11:32.710 align:start position:0%
that request from the governor is to
reduce

00:11:32.710 --> 00:11:32.720 align:start position:0%
reduce
 
00:11:35.750 --> 00:11:35.760 align:start position:0%
statewide emergency fund by one uh half
 
00:11:37.509 --> 00:11:37.519 align:start position:0%
a million dollars
 
00:11:40.870 --> 00:11:40.880 align:start position:0%
but they also in the the lapses we
 
00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:41.590 align:start position:0%
but they also in the the lapses we
extend

00:11:41.590 --> 00:11:41.600 align:start position:0%
extend
 
00:11:44.710 --> 00:11:44.720 align:start position:0%
a 670 000 laps
 
00:11:48.150 --> 00:11:48.160 align:start position:0%
so that they have 1.67 million
 
00:11:51.350 --> 00:11:51.360 align:start position:0%
in statewide emergency fund overall
 
00:11:56.230 --> 00:11:56.240 align:start position:0%
any questions about admin services
 
00:11:59.990 --> 00:12:00.000 align:start position:0%
we also agreed uh on page one
 
00:12:02.629 --> 00:12:02.639 align:start position:0%
to department of agriculture markets and
 
00:12:02.639 --> 00:12:03.509 align:start position:0%

for the big our building at the big e
 
00:12:15.750 --> 00:12:15.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:18.949 --> 00:12:18.959 align:start position:0%
next um department
 
00:12:22.389 --> 00:12:22.399 align:start position:0%
of corrections
 
00:12:25.910 --> 00:12:25.920 align:start position:0%
um we made two changes to
 
00:12:29.190 --> 00:12:29.200 align:start position:0%
to the department at our last one um
 
00:12:32.629 --> 00:12:32.639 align:start position:0%
the first is the state prison
 
00:12:35.030 --> 00:12:35.040 align:start position:0%
men's state prison and concord a door
 
00:12:36.150 --> 00:12:36.160 align:start position:0%
replacement which
 
00:12:39.190 --> 00:12:39.200 align:start position:0%
is one of their high priority
 
00:12:43.110 --> 00:12:43.120 align:start position:0%
for 200 000 and on the compare report
 
00:12:46.389 --> 00:12:46.399 align:start position:0%
it shows the men's prison
 
00:12:49.269 --> 00:12:49.279 align:start position:0%
ceiling and door replace repair in the
 
00:12:49.279 --> 00:12:49.670 align:start position:0%
ceiling and door replace repair in the
close

00:12:49.670 --> 00:12:49.680 align:start position:0%
close
 
00:12:52.870 --> 00:12:52.880 align:start position:0%
custody unit at zero dollars that is
 
00:12:55.350 --> 00:12:55.360 align:start position:0%
because we are using money
 
00:12:58.310 --> 00:12:58.320 align:start position:0%
from lapses to cover their requests is
 
00:13:03.190 --> 00:13:03.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:05.430 --> 00:13:05.440 align:start position:0%
mr shea is that i'm sorry i didn't know
 
00:13:06.949 --> 00:13:06.959 align:start position:0%

00:13:16.710 --> 00:13:16.720 align:start position:0%
decisions that were made last week where
 
00:13:19.430 --> 00:13:19.440 align:start position:0%
you split between um
 
00:13:21.670 --> 00:13:21.680 align:start position:0%
the repurposed funds and and new funds
 
00:13:23.750 --> 00:13:23.760 align:start position:0%

and after discussions with um represent
graham

00:13:24.710 --> 00:13:24.720 align:start position:0%
graham
 
00:13:26.550 --> 00:13:26.560 align:start position:0%
and trying to minimize some confusion on
 
00:13:28.389 --> 00:13:28.399 align:start position:0%
what the committee was actually funding
 
00:13:28.399 --> 00:13:29.110 align:start position:0%
what the committee was actually funding
we

00:13:29.110 --> 00:13:29.120 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:13:31.990 --> 00:13:32.000 align:start position:0%
tried to move projects totally over the
 
00:13:33.030 --> 00:13:33.040 align:start position:0%
repurposed area
 
00:13:35.190 --> 00:13:35.200 align:start position:0%
and fully fund them or into the new
 
00:13:36.949 --> 00:13:36.959 align:start position:0%
appropriation area and stay within the
 
00:13:36.959 --> 00:13:38.470 align:start position:0%
appropriation area and stay within the
limitations

00:13:38.470 --> 00:13:38.480 align:start position:0%
limitations
 
00:13:41.910 --> 00:13:41.920 align:start position:0%
of um the amount that you had agreed to
 
00:13:44.870 --> 00:13:44.880 align:start position:0%
so the the door replacement was a
 
00:13:46.550 --> 00:13:46.560 align:start position:0%
project you had originally split we
 
00:13:48.470 --> 00:13:48.480 align:start position:0%
brought that back into
 
00:13:50.710 --> 00:13:50.720 align:start position:0%
house bill 25 as a new appropriation and
 
00:13:52.790 --> 00:13:52.800 align:start position:0%
then put the closed custody unit
 
00:13:54.870 --> 00:13:54.880 align:start position:0%
as repurposed dollars of 300 thousand
 
00:13:54.880 --> 00:13:57.910 align:start position:0%
as repurposed dollars of 300 thousand
dollars

00:13:57.910 --> 00:13:57.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:01.110 --> 00:14:01.120 align:start position:0%
so it will be funded that the reason we
 
00:14:01.750 --> 00:14:01.760 align:start position:0%
did that
 
00:14:03.670 --> 00:14:03.680 align:start position:0%
is it's just easier to follow the
 
00:14:05.030 --> 00:14:05.040 align:start position:0%
bouncing ball
 
00:14:08.710 --> 00:14:08.720 align:start position:0%
um for future legislators and for
 
00:14:10.629 --> 00:14:10.639 align:start position:0%
everybody else involved with trying to
 
00:14:12.069 --> 00:14:12.079 align:start position:0%
figure out with the money
 
00:14:14.470 --> 00:14:14.480 align:start position:0%
it became readily apparent um when we
 
00:14:16.870 --> 00:14:16.880 align:start position:0%
get to it under the
 
00:14:19.030 --> 00:14:19.040 align:start position:0%
the adjutant general where we were
 
00:14:20.230 --> 00:14:20.240 align:start position:0%
trying to
 
00:14:22.470 --> 00:14:22.480 align:start position:0%
match federal funds and it wasn't clear
 
00:14:23.590 --> 00:14:23.600 align:start position:0%
where that
 
00:14:26.550 --> 00:14:26.560 align:start position:0%
complete match was coming from so in our
 
00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:27.430 align:start position:0%
complete match was coming from so in our
discussions

00:14:27.430 --> 00:14:27.440 align:start position:0%
discussions
 
00:14:31.750 --> 00:14:31.760 align:start position:0%
we um did that as as you recall
 
00:14:34.389 --> 00:14:34.399 align:start position:0%
at the end of our last work session
 
00:14:36.069 --> 00:14:36.079 align:start position:0%
representative jack
 
00:14:38.870 --> 00:14:38.880 align:start position:0%
i'm starting to make a motion that i'd
 
00:14:40.790 --> 00:14:40.800 align:start position:0%
be allowed to do that in conjunction
 
00:14:42.069 --> 00:14:42.079 align:start position:0%
with the lba
 
00:14:44.150 --> 00:14:44.160 align:start position:0%
and i said something to the words that
 
00:14:45.750 --> 00:14:45.760 align:start position:0%
without objection that's the way we're
 
00:14:46.870 --> 00:14:46.880 align:start position:0%
going to do it
 
00:14:49.030 --> 00:14:49.040 align:start position:0%
and i heard no objections so we did it
 
00:14:50.790 --> 00:14:50.800 align:start position:0%
that way
 
00:14:53.829 --> 00:14:53.839 align:start position:0%
but the dollar amount doesn't change
 
00:14:57.590 --> 00:14:57.600 align:start position:0%
the bottom line of the budget
 
00:15:00.550 --> 00:15:00.560 align:start position:0%
new money doesn't change which is for me
 
00:15:02.470 --> 00:15:02.480 align:start position:0%
was the key thing
 
00:15:04.310 --> 00:15:04.320 align:start position:0%
so anything about department of
 
00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:09.189 align:start position:0%
so anything about department of
corrections

00:15:09.189 --> 00:15:09.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:12.470 --> 00:15:12.480 align:start position:0%
all right department of education we
 
00:15:15.509 --> 00:15:15.519 align:start position:0%
had bathroom renovations
 
00:15:18.870 --> 00:15:18.880 align:start position:0%
we had tentatively agreed to six hundred
 
00:15:18.880 --> 00:15:20.389 align:start position:0%
we had tentatively agreed to six hundred
thousand

00:15:20.389 --> 00:15:20.399 align:start position:0%
thousand
 
00:15:25.189 --> 00:15:25.199 align:start position:0%
yesterday i spoke with um
 
00:15:27.750 --> 00:15:27.760 align:start position:0%
communicated with i didn't speak with
 
00:15:29.749 --> 00:15:29.759 align:start position:0%
the commissioner of education
 
00:15:32.470 --> 00:15:32.480 align:start position:0%
about these projects six hundred
 
00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:33.189 align:start position:0%
about these projects six hundred
thousand

00:15:33.189 --> 00:15:33.199 align:start position:0%
thousand
 
00:15:36.310 --> 00:15:36.320 align:start position:0%
is for six bathrooms two
 
00:15:39.350 --> 00:15:39.360 align:start position:0%
on each floor of his building he only
 
00:15:41.670 --> 00:15:41.680 align:start position:0%
requested that we do
 
00:15:46.150 --> 00:15:46.160 align:start position:0%
the the first floor which is where
 
00:15:48.310 --> 00:15:48.320 align:start position:0%
um the visitors come and where he really
 
00:15:50.870 --> 00:15:50.880 align:start position:0%
would like like to get it done
 
00:15:54.069 --> 00:15:54.079 align:start position:0%
so i would entertain a motion that
 
00:15:57.590 --> 00:15:57.600 align:start position:0%
we reduce that 600 000 to
 
00:16:01.990 --> 00:16:02.000 align:start position:0%
200 000 and it'd be for modifications
 
00:16:05.189 --> 00:16:05.199 align:start position:0%
um on the first floor and that
 
00:16:08.550 --> 00:16:08.560 align:start position:0%
um that 200 000
 
00:16:12.150 --> 00:16:12.160 align:start position:0%
of that would then be applied to
 
00:16:15.430 --> 00:16:15.440 align:start position:0%
um national cultural resources roofs and
 
00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:16.389 align:start position:0%
um national cultural resources roofs and
repair

00:16:16.389 --> 00:16:16.399 align:start position:0%
repair
 
00:16:18.230 --> 00:16:18.240 align:start position:0%
and we'll talk about that when we get
 
00:16:20.150 --> 00:16:20.160 align:start position:0%
there but i would entertain
 
00:16:24.150 --> 00:16:24.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:27.910 --> 00:16:27.920 align:start position:0%
go ahead and get it second okay
 
00:16:31.269 --> 00:16:31.279 align:start position:0%
all right um as i said
 
00:16:34.550 --> 00:16:34.560 align:start position:0%
we have motion to reduce that to 200 000
 
00:16:36.470 --> 00:16:36.480 align:start position:0%
which will do the first floor
 
00:16:38.710 --> 00:16:38.720 align:start position:0%
which is where the public is concerned
 
00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:39.509 align:start position:0%
which is where the public is concerned
obviously

00:16:39.509 --> 00:16:39.519 align:start position:0%
obviously
 
00:16:40.790 --> 00:16:40.800 align:start position:0%
in the future we're going to have to
 
00:16:44.470 --> 00:16:44.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:47.430 --> 00:16:47.440 align:start position:0%
but right now the commissioner is is
 
00:16:49.189 --> 00:16:49.199 align:start position:0%
truly concerned about
 
00:16:51.749 --> 00:16:51.759 align:start position:0%
public perception of when he goes when
 
00:16:53.749 --> 00:16:53.759 align:start position:0%
people visit his building
 
00:16:56.629 --> 00:16:56.639 align:start position:0%
and so i told him if at all possible we
 
00:16:58.629 --> 00:16:58.639 align:start position:0%
would work money into this budget for
 
00:16:58.639 --> 00:17:00.230 align:start position:0%
would work money into this budget for
that

00:17:00.230 --> 00:17:00.240 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:17:01.509 --> 00:17:01.519 align:start position:0%
but it is up to the will of the
 
00:17:05.510 --> 00:17:05.520 align:start position:0%
committee anybody else have
 
00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:08.710 align:start position:0%
committee anybody else have
um

00:17:08.710 --> 00:17:08.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:11.990 --> 00:17:12.000 align:start position:0%

was the worst part of that building uh
 
00:17:24.870 --> 00:17:24.880 align:start position:0%
yes we did and it's on the first floor
 
00:17:26.870 --> 00:17:26.880 align:start position:0%

the coastal flooding model and there is
a

00:22:25.029 --> 00:22:25.039 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:22:27.669 --> 00:22:27.679 align:start position:0%
lapse extension that we will repurpose
 
00:22:27.679 --> 00:22:28.549 align:start position:0%
lapse extension that we will repurpose
money

00:22:28.549 --> 00:22:28.559 align:start position:0%
money
 
00:22:30.870 --> 00:22:30.880 align:start position:0%
to bring that up to the total that they
 
00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:31.750 align:start position:0%
to bring that up to the total that they
need

00:22:31.750 --> 00:22:31.760 align:start position:0%
need
 
00:22:35.270 --> 00:22:35.280 align:start position:0%
for the coastal flooding model any
 
00:22:38.830 --> 00:22:38.840 align:start position:0%
questions or comments about those
 
00:22:38.840 --> 00:22:41.510 align:start position:0%
questions or comments about those
changes

00:22:41.510 --> 00:22:41.520 align:start position:0%
changes
 
00:22:44.710 --> 00:22:44.720 align:start position:0%
okay fish and game commission
 
00:22:47.909 --> 00:22:47.919 align:start position:0%
um we did not make any changes
 
00:22:51.510 --> 00:22:51.520 align:start position:0%
um the powder mill fish hatchery
 
00:22:56.149 --> 00:22:56.159 align:start position:0%
uh for 4.6 million
 
00:22:59.190 --> 00:22:59.200 align:start position:0%
moving on to whatever
 
00:23:02.789 --> 00:23:02.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:04.870 --> 00:23:04.880 align:start position:0%
which is the department of health and
 
00:23:06.710 --> 00:23:06.720 align:start position:0%
human services
 
00:23:11.270 --> 00:23:11.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:14.230 --> 00:23:14.240 align:start position:0%
on this we added the demolitions of the
 
00:23:15.990 --> 00:23:16.000 align:start position:0%
wilkins building
 
00:23:19.270 --> 00:23:19.280 align:start position:0%
uh 750 000
 
00:23:21.990 --> 00:23:22.000 align:start position:0%
because that is an attractive nuisance
 
00:23:23.750 --> 00:23:23.760 align:start position:0%
it's an abandoned building that has
 
00:23:23.760 --> 00:23:24.789 align:start position:0%
it's an abandoned building that has
burnt

00:23:24.789 --> 00:23:24.799 align:start position:0%
burnt
 
00:23:31.270 --> 00:23:31.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:34.789 --> 00:23:34.799 align:start position:0%
and i believe that that was the only
 
00:23:35.669 --> 00:23:35.679 align:start position:0%
change that
 
00:23:39.270 --> 00:23:39.280 align:start position:0%
that added money into this
 
00:23:46.549 --> 00:23:46.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:53.909 --> 00:23:53.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:56.950 --> 00:23:56.960 align:start position:0%
page four we made no
 
00:24:05.110 --> 00:24:05.120 align:start position:0%
changes to the liquor commission
 
00:24:08.310 --> 00:24:08.320 align:start position:0%
military affairs and veterans services
 
00:24:12.390 --> 00:24:12.400 align:start position:0%
this is where it became obvious that um
 
00:24:14.950 --> 00:24:14.960 align:start position:0%
to lba and myself that we needed to make
 
00:24:16.390 --> 00:24:16.400 align:start position:0%
that the changes on
 
00:24:18.950 --> 00:24:18.960 align:start position:0%
on how we were repurposing money if
 
00:24:20.149 --> 00:24:20.159 align:start position:0%
you'll note in
 
00:24:23.430 --> 00:24:23.440 align:start position:0%
green where it says readiness center
 
00:24:26.390 --> 00:24:26.400 align:start position:0%
renovations statewide six hundred
 
00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:27.350 align:start position:0%
renovations statewide six hundred
thousand

00:24:27.350 --> 00:24:27.360 align:start position:0%
thousand
 
00:24:30.470 --> 00:24:30.480 align:start position:0%
and six hundred thousand new funding
 
00:24:33.110 --> 00:24:33.120 align:start position:0%
that is to match 600 000 of federal
 
00:24:33.120 --> 00:24:34.070 align:start position:0%
that is to match 600 000 of federal
dollars

00:24:34.070 --> 00:24:34.080 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:24:37.590 --> 00:24:37.600 align:start position:0%
uh that belong below that um
 
00:24:41.029 --> 00:24:41.039 align:start position:0%
what we had proposed was taking
 
00:24:44.710 --> 00:24:44.720 align:start position:0%
uh from the line above it 415
 
00:24:48.630 --> 00:24:48.640 align:start position:0%
000 taking some money from um a lapse in
 
00:24:51.750 --> 00:24:51.760 align:start position:0%
and admin services combining them but it
 
00:24:53.750 --> 00:24:53.760 align:start position:0%
was hard to follow
 
00:24:56.870 --> 00:24:56.880 align:start position:0%
especially to the federal government um
 
00:24:59.430 --> 00:24:59.440 align:start position:0%
where the match was going to be coming
 
00:25:00.549 --> 00:25:00.559 align:start position:0%
from so it's just
 
00:25:03.430 --> 00:25:03.440 align:start position:0%
easier to do this and use the repurposed
 
00:25:03.440 --> 00:25:04.149 align:start position:0%
easier to do this and use the repurposed
money

00:25:04.149 --> 00:25:04.159 align:start position:0%
money
 
00:25:08.310 --> 00:25:08.320 align:start position:0%
uh further down um and we'll get to that
 
00:25:10.870 --> 00:25:10.880 align:start position:0%
and that was the changes doesn't change
 
00:25:12.230 --> 00:25:12.240 align:start position:0%
the bottom line
 
00:25:14.789 --> 00:25:14.799 align:start position:0%
but it makes the where the money comes
 
00:25:17.750 --> 00:25:17.760 align:start position:0%
from a little clearer
 
00:25:20.950 --> 00:25:20.960 align:start position:0%
any comments questions
 
00:25:25.269 --> 00:25:25.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:29.669 --> 00:25:29.679 align:start position:0%
i a couple of laughs all right um
 
00:25:36.310 --> 00:25:36.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:39.110 --> 00:25:39.120 align:start position:0%
roofing and repair under natural and
 
00:25:41.029 --> 00:25:41.039 align:start position:0%
cultural resources
 
00:25:43.430 --> 00:25:43.440 align:start position:0%
we had added a hundred and fifty
 
00:25:44.950 --> 00:25:44.960 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars
 
00:25:48.230 --> 00:25:48.240 align:start position:0%
um um
 
00:25:50.789 --> 00:25:50.799 align:start position:0%
i think uh representative mcconkey wants
 
00:25:51.750 --> 00:25:51.760 align:start position:0%
to take
 
00:25:54.149 --> 00:25:54.159 align:start position:0%
some of the money we saved from doe and
 
00:25:57.269 --> 00:25:57.279 align:start position:0%
move into there
 
00:25:59.029 --> 00:25:59.039 align:start position:0%
representative cloudy you have your hand
 
00:26:00.390 --> 00:26:00.400 align:start position:0%
up yes
 
00:26:02.549 --> 00:26:02.559 align:start position:0%
mr chairman i i don't mean to go back
 
00:26:04.789 --> 00:26:04.799 align:start position:0%
but i noticed the top of page four the
 
00:26:05.909 --> 00:26:05.919 align:start position:0%
judicial branches
 
00:26:08.470 --> 00:26:08.480 align:start position:0%
e courts i assume we're okay with that i
 
00:26:09.990 --> 00:26:10.000 align:start position:0%
didn't hear you talk about that
 
00:26:14.390 --> 00:26:14.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:16.950 --> 00:26:16.960 align:start position:0%
okay e court yeah we're okay with that i
 
00:26:18.470 --> 00:26:18.480 align:start position:0%
just want to be sure we skipped that
 
00:26:20.789 --> 00:26:20.799 align:start position:0%
over there
 
00:26:24.789 --> 00:26:24.799 align:start position:0%
thank you i had you while my cuckoo
 
00:26:25.990 --> 00:26:26.000 align:start position:0%
clock went off
 
00:26:29.110 --> 00:26:29.120 align:start position:0%
oh okay all right but i just you know
 
00:26:31.669 --> 00:26:31.679 align:start position:0%
so i think we're all set with e-coil
 
00:26:32.230 --> 00:26:32.240 align:start position:0%
okay good
 
00:26:35.029 --> 00:26:35.039 align:start position:0%
thank you another disadvantage from
 
00:26:36.830 --> 00:26:36.840 align:start position:0%
doing things at home
 
00:26:41.350 --> 00:26:41.360 align:start position:0%
uh representative mcconkey
 
00:26:44.230 --> 00:26:44.240 align:start position:0%
um thank you mr chairman uh with the
 
00:26:47.830 --> 00:26:47.840 align:start position:0%
savings uh realized over in d.o.e

um i would like to move 200
 
00:26:54.310 --> 00:26:54.320 align:start position:0%
000 and added an additional
 
00:26:58.149 --> 00:26:58.159 align:start position:0%
into roof repairs mainly for the state
 
00:26:59.669 --> 00:26:59.679 align:start position:0%
park system
 
00:27:01.590 --> 00:27:01.600 align:start position:0%
and if we can get an agreement on that
 
00:27:03.750 --> 00:27:03.760 align:start position:0%
then i know the chairman is going to
 
00:27:06.149 --> 00:27:06.159 align:start position:0%
speak later of accountability
 
00:27:09.190 --> 00:27:09.200 align:start position:0%
and having um and having those folks
 
00:27:10.710 --> 00:27:10.720 align:start position:0%
come before

capital budget overview as we go forward
 
00:27:15.029 --> 00:27:15.039 align:start position:0%
to make sure that
 
00:27:17.669 --> 00:27:17.679 align:start position:0%
that money is being spent as we direct

that money is being spent as we direct
it

00:27:18.149 --> 00:27:18.159 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:27:21.110 --> 00:27:21.120 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i'd like to second
 
00:27:23.029 --> 00:27:23.039 align:start position:0%

00:27:25.029 --> 00:27:25.039 align:start position:0%
uh thank you it's been moved and
 
00:27:27.190 --> 00:27:27.200 align:start position:0%
seconded that we increase
 
00:27:30.389 --> 00:27:30.399 align:start position:0%
the line item for roofing and repair
 
00:27:33.110 --> 00:27:33.120 align:start position:0%
by on under natural and cultural
 
00:27:33.120 --> 00:27:34.630 align:start position:0%
by on under natural and cultural
resources

00:27:34.630 --> 00:27:34.640 align:start position:0%
resources
 
00:27:37.750 --> 00:27:37.760 align:start position:0%
by 200 000 which would bring it
 
00:27:42.430 --> 00:27:42.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:42.440 --> 00:27:44.870 align:start position:0%
 
1.5

00:27:44.870 --> 00:27:44.880 align:start position:0%
1.5
 
00:27:49.510 --> 00:27:49.520 align:start position:0%
5 million as opposed to 1.35 that is
 
00:27:49.520 --> 00:27:50.149 align:start position:0%
5 million as opposed to 1.35 that is
there

00:27:50.149 --> 00:27:50.159 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:27:53.830 --> 00:27:53.840 align:start position:0%
if i could do the math of my head um
 
00:27:57.350 --> 00:27:57.360 align:start position:0%
and you want to talk to that motion
 
00:28:00.470 --> 00:28:00.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:04.310 --> 00:28:04.320 align:start position:0%
um thank you uh mr chairman um
 
00:28:06.789 --> 00:28:06.799 align:start position:0%
the uh park service and mentioned this
 
00:28:08.710 --> 00:28:08.720 align:start position:0%
previously and another day the park
 
00:28:10.310 --> 00:28:10.320 align:start position:0%
service is uh getting
 
00:28:13.909 --> 00:28:13.919 align:start position:0%
uh tremendous volumes of uh
 
00:28:17.990 --> 00:28:18.000 align:start position:0%
traffic uh don't see that discontinuing
 
00:28:22.149 --> 00:28:22.159 align:start position:0%
we have so many parks and so many sites
 
00:28:22.159 --> 00:28:23.350 align:start position:0%
we have so many parks and so many sites
that

00:28:23.350 --> 00:28:23.360 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:28:26.950 --> 00:28:26.960 align:start position:0%
that need upgrade this is a
 
00:28:28.870 --> 00:28:28.880 align:start position:0%
an entry point for a lot of people to
 
00:28:30.470 --> 00:28:30.480 align:start position:0%
enjoy our state
 
00:28:32.710 --> 00:28:32.720 align:start position:0%
and with sufficient oversight i think
 
00:28:34.630 --> 00:28:34.640 align:start position:0%
it's money well spent and it's been a
 
00:28:36.789 --> 00:28:36.799 align:start position:0%
long tradition of this
 
00:28:39.029 --> 00:28:39.039 align:start position:0%
committee that when we can find a little
 
00:28:40.950 --> 00:28:40.960 align:start position:0%
extra money
 
00:28:43.430 --> 00:28:43.440 align:start position:0%
we tend to send it to the state parks
 
00:28:46.630 --> 00:28:46.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:49.909 --> 00:28:49.919 align:start position:0%
thank you any other comments about
 
00:28:55.990 --> 00:28:56.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:59.110 --> 00:28:59.120 align:start position:0%
see representative edgar uh
 
00:29:02.710 --> 00:29:02.720 align:start position:0%
yeah thanks john um i was wondering
 
00:29:04.710 --> 00:29:04.720 align:start position:0%
i wasn't sure what was the total now
 
00:29:06.549 --> 00:29:06.559 align:start position:0%
going to be uh
 
00:29:10.470 --> 00:29:10.480 align:start position:0%
in this line item for the house for
 
00:29:13.909 --> 00:29:13.919 align:start position:0%
for this item yeah is it's going to be 1
 
00:29:15.350 --> 00:29:15.360 align:start position:0%
million something is it
 
00:29:18.630 --> 00:29:18.640 align:start position:0%
yeah 1.
 
00:29:21.830 --> 00:29:21.840 align:start position:0%
5 5 million um
 
00:29:24.230 --> 00:29:24.240 align:start position:0%
it went up from the 1.2 that the
 
00:29:26.710 --> 00:29:26.720 align:start position:0%
governor had proposed we had already
 
00:29:30.870 --> 00:29:30.880 align:start position:0%
um agreed to going up 150 so we go up
 
00:29:30.880 --> 00:29:31.510 align:start position:0%
um agreed to going up 150 so we go up
another

00:29:31.510 --> 00:29:31.520 align:start position:0%
another
 
00:29:35.269 --> 00:29:35.279 align:start position:0%
200 so it's a total of 350 over what the
 
00:29:35.279 --> 00:29:36.630 align:start position:0%
200 so it's a total of 350 over what the
governor

00:29:36.630 --> 00:29:36.640 align:start position:0%
governor
 
00:29:39.750 --> 00:29:39.760 align:start position:0%
proposed and if you look at their list
 
00:29:42.950 --> 00:29:42.960 align:start position:0%
that they provided of repairs and roofs
 
00:29:45.590 --> 00:29:45.600 align:start position:0%
throughout all of our state parks it's
 
00:29:47.110 --> 00:29:47.120 align:start position:0%
well worth it
 
00:29:50.549 --> 00:29:50.559 align:start position:0%
and i know over the last couple of
 
00:29:54.389 --> 00:29:54.399 align:start position:0%

we had made no changes to the governor's
 
00:32:53.279 --> 00:32:54.470 align:start position:0%
we had made no changes to the governor's
request

00:32:54.470 --> 00:32:54.480 align:start position:0%
request
 
00:32:58.149 --> 00:32:58.159 align:start position:0%
for that agency
 
00:33:01.509 --> 00:33:01.519 align:start position:0%
the veterans home we made
 
00:33:08.470 --> 00:33:08.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:11.750 --> 00:33:11.760 align:start position:0%
see no hands uh community college system
 
00:33:13.430 --> 00:33:13.440 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire
 
00:33:16.710 --> 00:33:16.720 align:start position:0%
um we added
 
00:33:19.190 --> 00:33:19.200 align:start position:0%
one million dollars of critical
 
00:33:19.200 --> 00:33:20.389 align:start position:0%
one million dollars of critical
maintenance

00:33:20.389 --> 00:33:20.399 align:start position:0%
maintenance
 
00:33:23.590 --> 00:33:23.600 align:start position:0%
to the um
 
00:33:26.870 --> 00:33:26.880 align:start position:0%
community college system now on your
 
00:33:30.430 --> 00:33:30.440 align:start position:0%
compare sheet it shows 828
 
00:33:34.230 --> 00:33:34.240 align:start position:0%
773 the remainder of the 1 million will
 
00:33:34.240 --> 00:33:34.789 align:start position:0%
773 the remainder of the 1 million will
be

00:33:34.789 --> 00:33:34.799 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:33:37.350 --> 00:33:37.360 align:start position:0%
paid for with repurposed funds from
 
00:33:39.110 --> 00:33:39.120 align:start position:0%
lapse extensions
 
00:33:43.029 --> 00:33:43.039 align:start position:0%
so they do have a full million dollars
 
00:33:45.029 --> 00:33:45.039 align:start position:0%
it's only about half of what they asked
 
00:33:47.029 --> 00:33:47.039 align:start position:0%
for in critical maintenance
 
00:33:49.590 --> 00:33:49.600 align:start position:0%
but they did kindly break it up into two
 
00:33:49.600 --> 00:33:50.630 align:start position:0%
but they did kindly break it up into two
sections

00:33:50.630 --> 00:33:50.640 align:start position:0%
sections
 
00:33:52.789 --> 00:33:52.799 align:start position:0%
and the first section came out right at
 
00:33:54.310 --> 00:33:54.320 align:start position:0%
1 million dollars
 
00:33:56.470 --> 00:33:56.480 align:start position:0%
plus or minus a little bit uh over a
 
00:33:57.590 --> 00:33:57.600 align:start position:0%
little bit
 
00:34:01.029 --> 00:34:01.039 align:start position:0%
um so i think that that works well for
 
00:34:04.549 --> 00:34:04.559 align:start position:0%
them any questions about why that number
 
00:34:10.310 --> 00:34:10.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:12.869 --> 00:34:12.879 align:start position:0%
department of safety we made no changes
 
00:34:17.109 --> 00:34:17.119 align:start position:0%

d.o.t we made no changes to the

requests on there we did add
 
00:34:29.430 --> 00:34:29.440 align:start position:0%
two um rail improvement
 
00:34:33.109 --> 00:34:33.119 align:start position:0%

on the compare that they have to report
 
00:34:44.869 --> 00:34:44.879 align:start position:0%
and it is
 
00:34:48.629 --> 00:34:48.639 align:start position:0%
um match dollar for dollar

and 250 000 to stratford and county rail
improvements

00:35:00.710 --> 00:35:00.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:03.750 --> 00:35:03.760 align:start position:0%
see no comments
 
00:35:06.150 --> 00:35:06.160 align:start position:0%
i will say that this is the quietest the
 
00:35:07.990 --> 00:35:08.000 align:start position:0%
committee has ever been
 
00:35:10.630 --> 00:35:10.640 align:start position:0%
because i think it's because we are on
 
00:35:10.640 --> 00:35:11.030 align:start position:0%
because i think it's because we are on
uh

00:35:11.030 --> 00:35:11.040 align:start position:0%

drafted and we approved
 
00:35:32.710 --> 00:35:32.720 align:start position:0%
and it shows here in the replacement
 
00:35:37.670 --> 00:35:37.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:42.230 --> 00:35:42.240 align:start position:0%

and then delayed projects um
 
00:35:49.109 --> 00:35:49.119 align:start position:0%
we added uh 2.15
 
00:35:53.670 --> 00:35:53.680 align:start position:0%
million um with a net change of 1.15
 
00:35:53.680 --> 00:35:54.470 align:start position:0%

00:36:05.349 --> 00:36:05.359 align:start position:0%
this budget so that was the changes
 
00:36:07.910 --> 00:36:07.920 align:start position:0%
and that was at the what the department
 
00:36:09.750 --> 00:36:09.760 align:start position:0%
actually requested
 
00:36:13.349 --> 00:36:13.359 align:start position:0%
um so we go from there and we made no
 
00:36:13.359 --> 00:36:14.710 align:start position:0%
um so we go from there and we made no
changes

00:36:14.710 --> 00:36:14.720 align:start position:0%
changes
 
00:36:17.670 --> 00:36:17.680 align:start position:0%

happy with what they were getting so
 
00:36:25.910 --> 00:36:25.920 align:start position:0%
we have that that is the compare report
 
00:36:28.150 --> 00:36:28.160 align:start position:0%
with the couple changes
 
00:36:30.950 --> 00:36:30.960 align:start position:0%
and i'm not going to do the math but we
 
00:36:33.109 --> 00:36:33.119 align:start position:0%
are going to come up
 
00:36:36.230 --> 00:36:36.240 align:start position:0%
with very close within
 
00:36:38.150 --> 00:36:38.160 align:start position:0%

beginning
 
00:36:51.990 --> 00:36:52.000 align:start position:0%

the bonding authority because
 
00:37:32.310 --> 00:37:32.320 align:start position:0%
it means that the as a percentage of
 
00:37:33.910 --> 00:37:33.920 align:start position:0%
unrestricted revenue goes
 
00:37:37.349 --> 00:37:37.359 align:start position:0%
up so that means the uh the ratio goes
 
00:37:37.359 --> 00:37:38.390 align:start position:0%
up so that means the uh the ratio goes
down

00:37:38.390 --> 00:37:38.400 align:start position:0%
down
 
00:37:41.030 --> 00:37:41.040 align:start position:0%
so that makes the uh that makes the
 
00:37:42.630 --> 00:37:42.640 align:start position:0%
amount that we're bonding even more
 
00:37:42.640 --> 00:37:44.390 align:start position:0%
amount that we're bonding even more
affordable

00:37:44.390 --> 00:37:44.400 align:start position:0%
affordable
 
00:37:48.069 --> 00:37:48.079 align:start position:0%
than it was that is correct and we shall
 
00:37:48.079 --> 00:37:49.190 align:start position:0%
than it was that is correct and we shall
see

00:37:49.190 --> 00:37:49.200 align:start position:0%
see
 
00:37:52.630 --> 00:37:52.640 align:start position:0%
what their future they are continuing to
 
00:37:52.640 --> 00:37:53.190 align:start position:0%
what their future they are continuing to
refine

00:37:53.190 --> 00:37:53.200 align:start position:0%
refine
 
00:37:56.550 --> 00:37:56.560 align:start position:0%
some of those numbers and they will
 
00:37:57.589 --> 00:37:57.599 align:start position:0%
refine them
 
00:38:01.990 --> 00:38:02.000 align:start position:0%
and the senate also then gets more
 
00:38:06.550 --> 00:38:06.560 align:start position:0%
updated figures so that they use
 
00:38:10.790 --> 00:38:10.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:12.390 --> 00:38:12.400 align:start position:0%
they sometimes
 
00:38:12.400 --> 00:38:14.069 align:start position:0%
they sometimes
[Music]

00:38:14.069 --> 00:38:14.079 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:38:17.109 --> 00:38:17.119 align:start position:0%
change things shall we say and this year
 
00:38:17.990 --> 00:38:18.000 align:start position:0%
hopefully we will
 
00:38:19.589 --> 00:38:19.599 align:start position:0%
have committees at conference
 
00:38:22.069 --> 00:38:22.079 align:start position:0%
representative philadelphia
 
00:38:26.150 --> 00:38:26.160 align:start position:0%
yeah i just i just want to comment
 
00:38:27.750 --> 00:38:27.760 align:start position:0%
that was it was good to hear you say
 
00:38:29.430 --> 00:38:29.440 align:start position:0%
that we're going to be very close to the
 
00:38:29.440 --> 00:38:30.230 align:start position:0%
that we're going to be very close to the
governor's

00:38:30.230 --> 00:38:30.240 align:start position:0%
governor's
 
00:38:34.630 --> 00:38:34.640 align:start position:0%
estimate i always prefer to go with
 
00:38:37.990 --> 00:38:38.000 align:start position:0%
the governor's estimates whether they're
 
00:38:39.670 --> 00:38:39.680 align:start position:0%
democrat or republican
 
00:38:41.430 --> 00:38:41.440 align:start position:0%
because a whole lot more people voted
 
00:38:43.990 --> 00:38:44.000 align:start position:0%
for them than voted for me
 
00:38:45.910 --> 00:38:45.920 align:start position:0%
and and they're the one and and they're
 
00:38:47.670 --> 00:38:47.680 align:start position:0%
the ones gonna have to bear the brunt of
 
00:38:48.790 --> 00:38:48.800 align:start position:0%
criticism from the
 
00:38:52.630 --> 00:38:52.640 align:start position:0%
general public so i'm i'm happy to hear
 
00:38:53.510 --> 00:38:53.520 align:start position:0%
you say
 
00:38:56.150 --> 00:38:56.160 align:start position:0%
that we're very close i you know and all
 
00:38:57.430 --> 00:38:57.440 align:start position:0%
the zooming and
 
00:39:01.109 --> 00:39:01.119 align:start position:0%
stuff i can't keep up with the
 
00:39:04.310 --> 00:39:04.320 align:start position:0%
the numbers and whatnot but i was happy
 
00:39:05.990 --> 00:39:06.000 align:start position:0%
to hear you say that and i know the
 
00:39:07.589 --> 00:39:07.599 align:start position:0%
leadership of both parties
 
00:39:10.710 --> 00:39:10.720 align:start position:0%
on the committee do get together
 
00:39:13.990 --> 00:39:14.000 align:start position:0%
and i trust them both so i'm
 
00:39:17.510 --> 00:39:17.520 align:start position:0%
very happy to hear that and and
 
00:39:20.630 --> 00:39:20.640 align:start position:0%
thank you for that um you know it does
 
00:39:21.990 --> 00:39:22.000 align:start position:0%
make a difference if
 
00:39:25.109 --> 00:39:25.119 align:start position:0%
if um as i said with
 
00:39:27.589 --> 00:39:27.599 align:start position:0%
our very first meeting we work
 
00:39:27.599 --> 00:39:28.710 align:start position:0%
our very first meeting we work
collegially

00:39:28.710 --> 00:39:28.720 align:start position:0%
collegially
 
00:39:32.310 --> 00:39:32.320 align:start position:0%
to get our results and i'm glad to see
 
00:39:34.230 --> 00:39:34.240 align:start position:0%
that that is continuing
 
00:39:37.030 --> 00:39:37.040 align:start position:0%
we sometimes disagree about things like
 
00:39:38.230 --> 00:39:38.240 align:start position:0%
coastal flooded
 
00:39:41.589 --> 00:39:41.599 align:start position:0%
moderate flood modeling
 
00:39:45.270 --> 00:39:45.280 align:start position:0%
but we come together at the end
 
00:39:48.670 --> 00:39:48.680 align:start position:0%
um the house bill
 
00:39:51.990 --> 00:39:52.000 align:start position:0%
25a you have
 
00:39:55.589 --> 00:39:55.599 align:start position:0%
my draft amendment a couple of the
 
00:39:56.550 --> 00:39:56.560 align:start position:0%
numbers will
 
00:40:00.470 --> 00:40:00.480 align:start position:0%
change in that um so that this will have
 
00:40:02.310 --> 00:40:02.320 align:start position:0%
to be redone
 
00:40:06.309 --> 00:40:06.319 align:start position:0%
but i would ask that um
 
00:40:12.309 --> 00:40:12.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:16.550 --> 00:40:16.560 align:start position:0%
um line five on page nine
 
00:40:20.470 --> 00:40:20.480 align:start position:0%
begins priority projects list
 
00:40:22.630 --> 00:40:22.640 align:start position:0%
if federal funds become available from
 
00:40:23.990 --> 00:40:24.000 align:start position:0%
the american rescue plan
 
00:40:27.829 --> 00:40:27.839 align:start position:0%
act of 2021 the following project should
 
00:40:28.950 --> 00:40:28.960 align:start position:0%
be identified
 
00:40:31.589 --> 00:40:31.599 align:start position:0%
identified as priority projects for
 
00:40:32.790 --> 00:40:32.800 align:start position:0%
funding and it's
 
00:40:36.710 --> 00:40:36.720 align:start position:0%
blank last time i did ask
 
00:40:40.710 --> 00:40:40.720 align:start position:0%
everybody to submit um what they thought
 
00:40:44.150 --> 00:40:44.160 align:start position:0%
one time high dollar
 
00:40:48.230 --> 00:40:48.240 align:start position:0%
ticket items for for one-time projects
 
00:40:51.349 --> 00:40:51.359 align:start position:0%
should be we came up with a list
 
00:40:56.630 --> 00:40:56.640 align:start position:0%
of about um that total about 41 million
 
00:40:59.109 --> 00:40:59.119 align:start position:0%
um which i would like to include does
 
00:41:01.270 --> 00:41:01.280 align:start position:0%
everybody have that
 
00:41:06.550 --> 00:41:06.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:09.430 --> 00:41:09.440 align:start position:0%
the first one is the forensic
 
00:41:11.430 --> 00:41:11.440 align:start position:0%
psychiatric hospital
 
00:41:14.950 --> 00:41:14.960 align:start position:0%
for 17 million 250 000
 
00:41:18.069 --> 00:41:18.079 align:start position:0%
uh dollars that is currently in house
 
00:41:18.079 --> 00:41:18.470 align:start position:0%
uh dollars that is currently in house
bill

00:41:18.470 --> 00:41:18.480 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:41:21.510 --> 00:41:21.520 align:start position:0%
2. mr shea you had a question
 
00:41:23.589 --> 00:41:23.599 align:start position:0%
i just was raised to say i didn't have a
 
00:41:24.550 --> 00:41:24.560 align:start position:0%
copy of the list
 
00:41:26.390 --> 00:41:26.400 align:start position:0%
so at the end if you could provide it to
 
00:41:26.400 --> 00:41:27.670 align:start position:0%
so at the end if you could provide it to
me

00:41:27.670 --> 00:41:27.680 align:start position:0%
me
 
00:41:30.069 --> 00:41:30.079 align:start position:0%
oh i thought you would get it when it
 
00:41:33.190 --> 00:41:33.200 align:start position:0%
went to every i will send it
 
00:41:36.950 --> 00:41:36.960 align:start position:0%
momentarily thank you yeah
 
00:41:40.630 --> 00:41:40.640 align:start position:0%
um as i started to say the the forensic
 
00:41:40.640 --> 00:41:41.430 align:start position:0%
um as i started to say the the forensic
hospital

00:41:41.430 --> 00:41:41.440 align:start position:0%
hospital
 
00:41:45.030 --> 00:41:45.040 align:start position:0%
is in house bill 2 with the
 
00:41:47.349 --> 00:41:47.359 align:start position:0%
statement that said it should if federal
 
00:41:49.190 --> 00:41:49.200 align:start position:0%
funds become available
 
00:41:51.910 --> 00:41:51.920 align:start position:0%
use that money otherwise it's bonded i
 
00:41:53.829 --> 00:41:53.839 align:start position:0%
want to reinforce that they should use
 
00:41:55.670 --> 00:41:55.680 align:start position:0%
the federal funds for this
 
00:41:58.550 --> 00:41:58.560 align:start position:0%
and not bond another 17 million dollars
 
00:41:58.560 --> 00:41:59.270 align:start position:0%
and not bond another 17 million dollars
for

00:41:59.270 --> 00:41:59.280 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:42:03.109 --> 00:42:03.119 align:start position:0%
for this several of
 
00:42:06.790 --> 00:42:06.800 align:start position:0%
of the committee uh recommended that we
 
00:42:10.390 --> 00:42:10.400 align:start position:0%
uh include uh the canon tramway
 
00:42:10.400 --> 00:42:11.589 align:start position:0%
uh include uh the canon tramway
replacement

00:42:11.589 --> 00:42:11.599 align:start position:0%
replacement
 
00:42:14.630 --> 00:42:14.640 align:start position:0%
for 6.5 million dollars
 
00:42:17.190 --> 00:42:17.200 align:start position:0%
which is a pretty close estimate it may
 
00:42:18.870 --> 00:42:18.880 align:start position:0%
come in a little less i know
 
00:42:21.270 --> 00:42:21.280 align:start position:0%
representative abbott was trying to
 
00:42:23.190 --> 00:42:23.200 align:start position:0%
fine-tune that number
 
00:42:25.750 --> 00:42:25.760 align:start position:0%
but at this point where it's a
 
00:42:27.750 --> 00:42:27.760 align:start position:0%
recommended priority list i think we
 
00:42:30.550 --> 00:42:30.560 align:start position:0%
should go with the figure that
 
00:42:33.829 --> 00:42:33.839 align:start position:0%
the agency has come up with
 
00:42:35.829 --> 00:42:35.839 align:start position:0%
representative abbott you have your hand
 
00:42:35.839 --> 00:42:38.390 align:start position:0%
representative abbott you have your hand
up

00:42:38.390 --> 00:42:38.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:41.670 --> 00:42:41.680 align:start position:0%
yes thank you mr chairman i the question
 
00:42:42.230 --> 00:42:42.240 align:start position:0%
i had
 
00:42:45.510 --> 00:42:45.520 align:start position:0%
do we have any idea what
 
00:42:48.069 --> 00:42:48.079 align:start position:0%
is in this really fact for capital
 
00:42:48.079 --> 00:42:50.550 align:start position:0%
is in this really fact for capital
projects

00:42:50.550 --> 00:42:50.560 align:start position:0%
projects
 
00:42:53.910 --> 00:42:53.920 align:start position:0%
um my understanding
 
00:42:58.230 --> 00:42:58.240 align:start position:0%
is that within the the
 
00:43:01.910 --> 00:43:01.920 align:start position:0%
recovery plan act there's 122 million
 
00:43:01.920 --> 00:43:03.750 align:start position:0%
recovery plan act there's 122 million
dollars

00:43:03.750 --> 00:43:03.760 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:43:07.030 --> 00:43:07.040 align:start position:0%
allegedly coming to the state
 
00:43:10.069 --> 00:43:10.079 align:start position:0%
for state capital improvement
 
00:43:13.190 --> 00:43:13.200 align:start position:0%
projects what the strings are on that
 
00:43:15.910 --> 00:43:15.920 align:start position:0%
what the guidance on that are nobody has
 
00:43:17.589 --> 00:43:17.599 align:start position:0%
at the moment
 
00:43:20.710 --> 00:43:20.720 align:start position:0%
i know that the governor has stated
 
00:43:24.230 --> 00:43:24.240 align:start position:0%
that he wants to use all of the money
 
00:43:26.790 --> 00:43:26.800 align:start position:0%
that is coming in for one-time
 
00:43:30.630 --> 00:43:30.640 align:start position:0%
projects if if possible
 
00:43:34.630 --> 00:43:34.640 align:start position:0%
he has formed a small working group
 
00:43:37.180 --> 00:43:37.190 align:start position:0%
to advise him on
 
00:43:37.190 --> 00:43:38.550 align:start position:0%
to advise him on
[Music]

00:43:38.550 --> 00:43:38.560 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:43:42.069 --> 00:43:42.079 align:start position:0%
this money that may be coming in
 
00:43:45.430 --> 00:43:45.440 align:start position:0%
i have input to that small working group
 
00:43:47.829 --> 00:43:47.839 align:start position:0%
because the speaker is on that
 
00:43:51.109 --> 00:43:51.119 align:start position:0%
um and the speaker did ask me
 
00:43:53.990 --> 00:43:54.000 align:start position:0%
for a list like this to talk with the
 
00:43:55.589 --> 00:43:55.599 align:start position:0%
governor about it
 
00:43:58.630 --> 00:43:58.640 align:start position:0%
but until we get
 
00:44:02.390 --> 00:44:02.400 align:start position:0%
all of the guidance and
 
00:44:04.069 --> 00:44:04.079 align:start position:0%
from the federal government which will
 
00:44:05.510 --> 00:44:05.520 align:start position:0%
not be until mid
 
00:44:08.550 --> 00:44:08.560 align:start position:0%
to late april at this point
 
00:44:11.270 --> 00:44:11.280 align:start position:0%
our best guess is to put these projects
 
00:44:11.280 --> 00:44:11.829 align:start position:0%
our best guess is to put these projects
down

00:44:11.829 --> 00:44:11.839 align:start position:0%
down
 
00:44:15.349 --> 00:44:15.359 align:start position:0%
as what we would like to do with
 
00:44:18.390 --> 00:44:18.400 align:start position:0%
with the money and continue
 
00:44:21.109 --> 00:44:21.119 align:start position:0%
to press both the senate and the
 
00:44:22.470 --> 00:44:22.480 align:start position:0%
governor's office
 
00:44:25.829 --> 00:44:25.839 align:start position:0%
to find a way to do some
 
00:44:30.150 --> 00:44:30.160 align:start position:0%
or all of that the third project
 
00:44:33.430 --> 00:44:33.440 align:start position:0%
which of again several members wanted to
 
00:44:33.440 --> 00:44:34.309 align:start position:0%
which of again several members wanted to
do

you will remember that that is leaking
 
00:44:57.670 --> 00:44:57.680 align:start position:0%
and they are um
 
00:45:00.630 --> 00:45:00.640 align:start position:0%
patching it and the same with the men's
 
00:45:00.640 --> 00:45:01.190 align:start position:0%
patching it and the same with the men's
prison

00:45:01.190 --> 00:45:01.200 align:start position:0%

00:45:20.240 --> 00:45:21.190 align:start position:0%
glencliff came up a couple of times from
people

00:45:21.190 --> 00:45:21.200 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:45:25.510 --> 00:45:25.520 align:start position:0%
the roof at um the lamont building
 
00:45:29.109 --> 00:45:29.119 align:start position:0%
for uh 500 000
 
00:45:31.349 --> 00:45:31.359 align:start position:0%
and then the waste water treatment
 
00:45:35.270 --> 00:45:35.280 align:start position:0%
system for 1.2 million
 
00:45:38.390 --> 00:45:38.400 align:start position:0%

improvement projects
 
00:45:49.589 --> 00:45:49.599 align:start position:0%
for 2 million which does have a
 
00:45:53.109 --> 00:45:53.119 align:start position:0%
cost saving and payback over over time
 
00:45:55.670 --> 00:45:55.680 align:start position:0%
and that's under administrative services
 
00:45:59.589 --> 00:45:59.599 align:start position:0%
so the total of that comes to 41 350
 
00:45:59.599 --> 00:46:03.430 align:start position:0%
so the total of that comes to 41 350
000

00:46:03.430 --> 00:46:03.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:06.550 --> 00:46:06.560 align:start position:0%
i think it is a good list most of them
 
00:46:09.430 --> 00:46:09.440 align:start position:0%
are one-time things that we're going to
 
00:46:12.710 --> 00:46:12.720 align:start position:0%
have to do at some point
 
00:46:16.710 --> 00:46:16.720 align:start position:0%
the way it will read uh is priority
 
00:46:19.190 --> 00:46:19.200 align:start position:0%
projects list if federal funds become
 
00:46:21.510 --> 00:46:21.520 align:start position:0%
available from the american rescue plan
 
00:46:21.520 --> 00:46:22.309 align:start position:0%
available from the american rescue plan
act

00:46:22.309 --> 00:46:22.319 align:start position:0%
act
 
00:46:24.550 --> 00:46:24.560 align:start position:0%
the following capital project should
 
00:46:26.790 --> 00:46:26.800 align:start position:0%
shall be identified as priority
 
00:46:29.030 --> 00:46:29.040 align:start position:0%
for funding and and then there's the
 
00:46:29.040 --> 00:46:29.990 align:start position:0%
for funding and and then there's the
list

00:46:29.990 --> 00:46:30.000 align:start position:0%
list
 
00:46:32.630 --> 00:46:32.640 align:start position:0%
as i've said i've already provided this
 
00:46:32.640 --> 00:46:33.190 align:start position:0%
as i've said i've already provided this
this

00:46:33.190 --> 00:46:33.200 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:46:35.349 --> 00:46:35.359 align:start position:0%
tentative list to the speaker for his
 
00:46:39.430 --> 00:46:39.440 align:start position:0%
youth in discussions with the governor
 
00:46:41.670 --> 00:46:41.680 align:start position:0%
i have not received any feedback those
 
00:46:43.190 --> 00:46:43.200 align:start position:0%
discussions are just
 
00:46:45.430 --> 00:46:45.440 align:start position:0%
starting because right now everybody is
 
00:46:47.190 --> 00:46:47.200 align:start position:0%
more concerned about
 
00:46:52.309 --> 00:46:52.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:54.790 --> 00:46:54.800 align:start position:0%
representative jack i see your hand up
 
00:46:54.800 --> 00:46:55.510 align:start position:0%
representative jack i see your hand up
and

00:46:55.510 --> 00:46:55.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:46:57.430 --> 00:46:57.440 align:start position:0%
you're not recognized for a motion but
 
00:46:58.790 --> 00:46:58.800 align:start position:0%
you can speak
 
00:47:02.309 --> 00:47:02.319 align:start position:0%
all right i i wanted to uh
 
00:47:03.829 --> 00:47:03.839 align:start position:0%
i wanted to just point out to everyone
 
00:47:06.470 --> 00:47:06.480 align:start position:0%
there's still 82 million dollars
 
00:47:09.510 --> 00:47:09.520 align:start position:0%
uh that if we get that 122
 
00:47:11.430 --> 00:47:11.440 align:start position:0%
that are not covered by that so there's
 
00:47:12.790 --> 00:47:12.800 align:start position:0%
plenty of money
 
00:47:15.829 --> 00:47:15.839 align:start position:0%
to do other things that there
 
00:47:20.950 --> 00:47:20.960 align:start position:0%
is and i know that the governor
 
00:47:23.109 --> 00:47:23.119 align:start position:0%
understands that there are lots of pent
 
00:47:24.470 --> 00:47:24.480 align:start position:0%
up projects
 
00:47:27.430 --> 00:47:27.440 align:start position:0%
i mean i would like to go with with our
 
00:47:29.430 --> 00:47:29.440 align:start position:0%
list of what we have heard what we have
 
00:47:29.440 --> 00:47:30.390 align:start position:0%
list of what we have heard what we have
heard

00:47:30.390 --> 00:47:30.400 align:start position:0%
heard
 
00:47:33.510 --> 00:47:33.520 align:start position:0%
over the last month or so with what the
 
00:47:35.030 --> 00:47:35.040 align:start position:0%
agencies need for
 
00:47:37.430 --> 00:47:37.440 align:start position:0%
for bigger projects that we can't fund
 
00:47:38.950 --> 00:47:38.960 align:start position:0%
at this point
 
00:47:41.990 --> 00:47:42.000 align:start position:0%
um i am sure that the agencies
 
00:47:43.589 --> 00:47:43.599 align:start position:0%
every single one of them once they
 
00:47:45.990 --> 00:47:46.000 align:start position:0%
figure this out are going to be beating
 
00:47:47.349 --> 00:47:47.359 align:start position:0%
on his door
 
00:47:50.790 --> 00:47:50.800 align:start position:0%
um asking for their pet projects
 
00:47:53.910 --> 00:47:53.920 align:start position:0%
um but when i look at the top three of
 
00:47:53.920 --> 00:47:55.510 align:start position:0%
um but when i look at the top three of
ours

00:47:55.510 --> 00:47:55.520 align:start position:0%
ours
 
00:47:58.549 --> 00:47:58.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:00.710 --> 00:48:00.720 align:start position:0%
the forensic hospital will probably get
 
00:48:03.030 --> 00:48:03.040 align:start position:0%
funded out of this
 
00:48:06.230 --> 00:48:06.240 align:start position:0%
the psychiatric hospital i know that
 
00:48:07.829 --> 00:48:07.839 align:start position:0%
there is enough
 
00:48:10.230 --> 00:48:10.240 align:start position:0%
groundswell within certain segments of
 
00:48:11.829 --> 00:48:11.839 align:start position:0%
the population
 
00:48:16.150 --> 00:48:16.160 align:start position:0%
to do the expansion in littleton
 
00:48:18.309 --> 00:48:18.319 align:start position:0%
that they will be beating on his door if
 
00:48:20.790 --> 00:48:20.800 align:start position:0%
the community college system is not
 
00:48:26.150 --> 00:48:26.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:29.190 --> 00:48:29.200 align:start position:0%
the department and others that we need
 
00:48:31.430 --> 00:48:31.440 align:start position:0%
to begin
 
00:48:33.030 --> 00:48:33.040 align:start position:0%
spending the money to replace the
 
00:48:34.950 --> 00:48:34.960 align:start position:0%
tramway at
 
00:48:38.870 --> 00:48:38.880 align:start position:0%
cannon um that is used year-round
 
00:48:41.910 --> 00:48:41.920 align:start position:0%
um i know many of us have gone up in the
 
00:48:41.920 --> 00:48:42.630 align:start position:0%
um i know many of us have gone up in the
fall

00:48:42.630 --> 00:48:42.640 align:start position:0%
fall
 
00:48:45.829 --> 00:48:45.839 align:start position:0%
in the summer it is a big tourist
 
00:48:45.839 --> 00:48:46.950 align:start position:0%
in the summer it is a big tourist
attraction

00:48:46.950 --> 00:48:46.960 align:start position:0%
attraction
 
00:48:49.030 --> 00:48:49.040 align:start position:0%
so that is the list that i would like to
 
00:48:50.390 --> 00:48:50.400 align:start position:0%
include in this
 
00:48:54.549 --> 00:48:54.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:58.069 --> 00:48:58.079 align:start position:0%
and it gives us if not a seat at the
 
00:48:58.079 --> 00:48:58.630 align:start position:0%
and it gives us if not a seat at the
table

00:48:58.630 --> 00:48:58.640 align:start position:0%
table
 
00:49:01.750 --> 00:49:01.760 align:start position:0%
at least a say in what we think is
 
00:49:08.309 --> 00:49:08.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:11.430 --> 00:49:11.440 align:start position:0%
yes mr chairman excuse my ignorance
 
00:49:14.710 --> 00:49:14.720 align:start position:0%
but uh is there a time frame for when
 
00:49:16.790 --> 00:49:16.800 align:start position:0%
this relief bill will be
 
00:49:19.910 --> 00:49:19.920 align:start position:0%
expired uh
 
00:49:22.870 --> 00:49:22.880 align:start position:0%
well it's in law right now and the
 
00:49:24.390 --> 00:49:24.400 align:start position:0%
treasury department had
 
00:49:27.510 --> 00:49:27.520 align:start position:0%
60 days from date of signing to provide
 
00:49:29.510 --> 00:49:29.520 align:start position:0%
the guidance to the states
 
00:49:32.870 --> 00:49:32.880 align:start position:0%
on how the money can be spent so
 
00:49:36.790 --> 00:49:36.800 align:start position:0%
it is going to be another
 
00:49:39.910 --> 00:49:39.920 align:start position:0%
three or four weeks before that comes
 
00:49:39.920 --> 00:49:40.710 align:start position:0%
three or four weeks before that comes
out

00:49:40.710 --> 00:49:40.720 align:start position:0%
out
 
00:49:42.470 --> 00:49:42.480 align:start position:0%
and then it will take all of the
 
00:49:44.470 --> 00:49:44.480 align:start position:0%
departments and lawyers
 
00:49:47.670 --> 00:49:47.680 align:start position:0%
and everybody else at the in the
 
00:49:50.549 --> 00:49:50.559 align:start position:0%
executive branch to try to figure out
 
00:49:54.150 --> 00:49:54.160 align:start position:0%
what the arcane guidance from
 
00:49:56.309 --> 00:49:56.319 align:start position:0%
u.s treasury means about how they can
 
00:49:57.510 --> 00:49:57.520 align:start position:0%
actually spend
 
00:50:00.230 --> 00:50:00.240 align:start position:0%
not just the capital portion but the
 
00:50:00.240 --> 00:50:00.870 align:start position:0%
not just the capital portion but the
other

00:50:00.870 --> 00:50:00.880 align:start position:0%
other
 
00:50:04.230 --> 00:50:04.240 align:start position:0%
uh billion dollars a little less that
 
00:50:07.589 --> 00:50:07.599 align:start position:0%
will be coming to the state so
 
00:50:10.309 --> 00:50:10.319 align:start position:0%
we will not have a handle on that before
 
00:50:15.190 --> 00:50:15.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:18.309 --> 00:50:18.319 align:start position:0%
representative newman yes
 
00:50:21.270 --> 00:50:21.280 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and and i'll plead
 
00:50:22.309 --> 00:50:22.319 align:start position:0%
some ignorance
 
00:50:26.230 --> 00:50:26.240 align:start position:0%
also on the on the roof um
 
00:50:29.270 --> 00:50:29.280 align:start position:0%
for the prison roof replacement at the
 
00:50:31.349 --> 00:50:31.359 align:start position:0%
concord men's prison
 
00:50:33.829 --> 00:50:33.839 align:start position:0%
in the blue book the the number had been
 
00:50:34.630 --> 00:50:34.640 align:start position:0%
a million
 
00:50:38.309 --> 00:50:38.319 align:start position:0%
nine hundred and twenty thousand so um
 
00:50:40.309 --> 00:50:40.319 align:start position:0%
maybe i missed something where the extra
 
00:50:42.790 --> 00:50:42.800 align:start position:0%
20 000 was going to be
 
00:50:45.990 --> 00:50:46.000 align:start position:0%
i rounded numbers i mean this
 
00:50:49.270 --> 00:50:49.280 align:start position:0%
is just a priority list
 
00:50:52.790 --> 00:50:52.800 align:start position:0%
if the project is picked um and i'm not
 
00:50:55.270 --> 00:50:55.280 align:start position:0%
even sure um
 
00:50:58.549 --> 00:50:58.559 align:start position:0%
um and maybe mr shea can answer whether
 
00:50:59.349 --> 00:50:59.359 align:start position:0%
when we put
 
00:51:02.230 --> 00:51:02.240 align:start position:0%
a priority project list if we even have
 
00:51:03.990 --> 00:51:04.000 align:start position:0%
to include dollar amounts
 
00:51:05.990 --> 00:51:06.000 align:start position:0%
i i would think that we have to come up
 
00:51:07.670 --> 00:51:07.680 align:start position:0%
with an approximation
 
00:51:11.750 --> 00:51:11.760 align:start position:0%
so people know what we're talking about
 
00:51:14.549 --> 00:51:14.559 align:start position:0%
all right all right and could i just ask
 
00:51:15.990 --> 00:51:16.000 align:start position:0%
another question of you
 
00:51:18.309 --> 00:51:18.319 align:start position:0%
let me get that one answered by mr shea
 
00:51:18.319 --> 00:51:19.190 align:start position:0%
let me get that one answered by mr shea
first

00:51:19.190 --> 00:51:19.200 align:start position:0%
first
 
00:51:21.349 --> 00:51:21.359 align:start position:0%
okay thank you thank you represent
 
00:51:21.359 --> 00:51:22.230 align:start position:0%
okay thank you thank you represent
graham

00:51:22.230 --> 00:51:22.240 align:start position:0%
graham
 
00:51:23.510 --> 00:51:23.520 align:start position:0%
no you don't have to put the dollar
 
00:51:26.390 --> 00:51:26.400 align:start position:0%
amount in but i think to your point
 
00:51:28.150 --> 00:51:28.160 align:start position:0%
to show your priority list it's probably
 
00:51:30.230 --> 00:51:30.240 align:start position:0%
good to let others see what the cost
 
00:51:32.069 --> 00:51:32.079 align:start position:0%
might be associated with the project
 
00:51:34.150 --> 00:51:34.160 align:start position:0%
yeah thinking about trying to divvy up a
 
00:51:35.670 --> 00:51:35.680 align:start position:0%
potential pot of money that's coming to
 
00:51:36.710 --> 00:51:36.720 align:start position:0%
the state
 
00:51:39.589 --> 00:51:39.599 align:start position:0%
yeah and as you noted if a project is
 
00:51:39.599 --> 00:51:40.150 align:start position:0%
yeah and as you noted if a project is
chosen

00:51:40.150 --> 00:51:40.160 align:start position:0%
chosen
 
00:51:42.069 --> 00:51:42.079 align:start position:0%
it would get reviewed again in terms of
 
00:51:44.390 --> 00:51:44.400 align:start position:0%
the cost
 
00:51:46.390 --> 00:51:46.400 align:start position:0%
okay thank you all right representative
 
00:51:48.549 --> 00:51:48.559 align:start position:0%
newman you had another question
 
00:51:50.950 --> 00:51:50.960 align:start position:0%
i do and and this is one i struggled
 
00:51:52.309 --> 00:51:52.319 align:start position:0%
with when i was trying to
 
00:51:54.549 --> 00:51:54.559 align:start position:0%
follow your directions to come up with
 
00:51:55.829 --> 00:51:55.839 align:start position:0%
one project
 
00:51:59.510 --> 00:51:59.520 align:start position:0%
um the land the land the five hundred
 
00:52:01.030 --> 00:52:01.040 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars that the adjutant
 
00:52:03.589 --> 00:52:03.599 align:start position:0%
general had asked for
 
00:52:05.910 --> 00:52:05.920 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to make sure he had
 
00:52:05.920 --> 00:52:06.710 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to make sure he had
something

00:52:06.710 --> 00:52:06.720 align:start position:0%
something
 
00:52:08.630 --> 00:52:08.640 align:start position:0%
and and i just didn't seem to be a
 
00:52:10.390 --> 00:52:10.400 align:start position:0%
project it seemed to be a request for
 
00:52:11.910 --> 00:52:11.920 align:start position:0%
dollar amount so
 
00:52:14.790 --> 00:52:14.800 align:start position:0%
um i was struggling with that because i
 
00:52:16.069 --> 00:52:16.079 align:start position:0%
saw a need for it
 
00:52:19.349 --> 00:52:19.359 align:start position:0%
for him to be able to have it
 
00:52:22.309 --> 00:52:22.319 align:start position:0%
my understanding of that is he just
 
00:52:22.319 --> 00:52:23.430 align:start position:0%
my understanding of that is he just
wanted

00:52:23.430 --> 00:52:23.440 align:start position:0%
wanted
 
00:52:26.230 --> 00:52:26.240 align:start position:0%
money in the bag in case he found a
 
00:52:28.630 --> 00:52:28.640 align:start position:0%
piece of land he wanted to put a deposit
 
00:52:28.640 --> 00:52:29.510 align:start position:0%
piece of land he wanted to put a deposit
on

00:52:29.510 --> 00:52:29.520 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:52:35.109 --> 00:52:35.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:38.870 --> 00:52:38.880 align:start position:0%
enough money to fix my roof but uh
 
00:52:43.270 --> 00:52:43.280 align:start position:0%
without having to go to the bank but um
 
00:52:46.630 --> 00:52:46.640 align:start position:0%
um there is nothing on the horizon
 
00:52:49.829 --> 00:52:49.839 align:start position:0%
that he spoke about where there's a need
 
00:52:52.150 --> 00:52:52.160 align:start position:0%
for him to have that money
 
00:52:55.589 --> 00:52:55.599 align:start position:0%
uh set aside and tying up
 
00:53:00.150 --> 00:53:00.160 align:start position:0%
uh bonding if something came up
 
00:53:05.190 --> 00:53:05.200 align:start position:0%
um i am sure that he could make the case
 
00:53:07.670 --> 00:53:07.680 align:start position:0%
uh to either the senate or to the
 
00:53:07.680 --> 00:53:09.270 align:start position:0%
uh to either the senate or to the
governor

00:53:09.270 --> 00:53:09.280 align:start position:0%
governor
 
00:53:11.750 --> 00:53:11.760 align:start position:0%
that he needed to do it but nothing that
 
00:53:13.510 --> 00:53:13.520 align:start position:0%
i i heard
 
00:53:16.950 --> 00:53:16.960 align:start position:0%
in the next two years i mean it's just
 
00:53:19.750 --> 00:53:19.760 align:start position:0%
you know he's got his hands filled with
 
00:53:22.069 --> 00:53:22.079 align:start position:0%
doing the other things that he's got on
 
00:53:22.079 --> 00:53:22.950 align:start position:0%
doing the other things that he's got on
there

00:53:22.950 --> 00:53:22.960 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:53:27.190 --> 00:53:27.200 align:start position:0%
um as well as some other things
 
00:53:30.549 --> 00:53:30.559 align:start position:0%
okay and i i yeah i would just add i
 
00:53:32.230 --> 00:53:32.240 align:start position:0%
think he made
 
00:53:33.910 --> 00:53:33.920 align:start position:0%
i think he made the case that his
 
00:53:35.270 --> 00:53:35.280 align:start position:0%
armories were
 
00:53:38.710 --> 00:53:38.720 align:start position:0%
um i mean that they were at capacity and
 
00:53:41.109 --> 00:53:41.119 align:start position:0%
they were fully utilized right now well
 
00:53:42.870 --> 00:53:42.880 align:start position:0%
they they are but he can't recruit
 
00:53:44.710 --> 00:53:44.720 align:start position:0%
enough to fill them
 
00:53:47.190 --> 00:53:47.200 align:start position:0%
um okay that was that problem
 
00:53:49.270 --> 00:53:49.280 align:start position:0%
representative jack
 
00:53:51.190 --> 00:53:51.200 align:start position:0%
uh thank you there is a lapse extension
 
00:53:52.710 --> 00:53:52.720 align:start position:0%
for land acquisition i don't know how
 
00:53:54.390 --> 00:53:54.400 align:start position:0%
much money is in the account but he does
 
00:53:55.589 --> 00:53:55.599 align:start position:0%
have some money
 
00:53:59.190 --> 00:53:59.200 align:start position:0%
yeah and you know it's
 
00:54:02.230 --> 00:54:02.240 align:start position:0%
it's there if he had a project like for
 
00:54:04.230 --> 00:54:04.240 align:start position:0%
the members who've been here a while
 
00:54:07.349 --> 00:54:07.359 align:start position:0%
he he did come in a couple of times with
 
00:54:10.790 --> 00:54:10.800 align:start position:0%
um for the the new
 
00:54:13.349 --> 00:54:13.359 align:start position:0%
center that that has been built uh and
 
00:54:15.430 --> 00:54:15.440 align:start position:0%
they needed to purchase the land before
 
00:54:17.670 --> 00:54:17.680 align:start position:0%
the federal government would build the
 
00:54:20.150 --> 00:54:20.160 align:start position:0%
the new training center and and we
 
00:54:21.829 --> 00:54:21.839 align:start position:0%
appropriated that money but
 
00:54:23.990 --> 00:54:24.000 align:start position:0%
we knew where it was going ahead of time
 
00:54:26.790 --> 00:54:26.800 align:start position:0%
so it just made some sense
 
00:54:30.069 --> 00:54:30.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:33.109 --> 00:54:33.119 align:start position:0%
any other comments about the priority
 
00:54:33.119 --> 00:54:37.270 align:start position:0%
any other comments about the priority
list

00:54:37.270 --> 00:54:37.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:40.549 --> 00:54:40.559 align:start position:0%
seeing none it will go into
 
00:54:44.710 --> 00:54:44.720 align:start position:0%
um house bill 25 with the dollar amounts
 
00:54:48.390 --> 00:54:48.400 align:start position:0%
as uh mr shea said if if
 
00:54:52.069 --> 00:54:52.079 align:start position:0%
they get picked in the future um
 
00:54:55.270 --> 00:54:55.280 align:start position:0%
and i will be lobbying uh the executive
 
00:54:57.030 --> 00:54:57.040 align:start position:0%
branch and the senate
 
00:55:00.069 --> 00:55:00.079 align:start position:0%
um to to keep that list in there
 
00:55:03.670 --> 00:55:03.680 align:start position:0%
and to do it we'll do it mr shea
 
00:55:05.270 --> 00:55:05.280 align:start position:0%
thank you represent graham and when we
 
00:55:08.390 --> 00:55:08.400 align:start position:0%
included in the house bill 25
 
00:55:11.349 --> 00:55:11.359 align:start position:0%
i'll put estimated cost over the dollar
 
00:55:12.630 --> 00:55:12.640 align:start position:0%
value versus yeah
 
00:55:16.549 --> 00:55:16.559 align:start position:0%
that way there's no question thank you
 
00:55:19.990 --> 00:55:20.000 align:start position:0%
um but i think that by doing this
 
00:55:23.270 --> 00:55:23.280 align:start position:0%
we do get a virtual seat
 
00:55:26.950 --> 00:55:26.960 align:start position:0%
at the at the table if not a real one um
 
00:55:29.670 --> 00:55:29.680 align:start position:0%
but you know i i get along well enough
 
00:55:32.150 --> 00:55:32.160 align:start position:0%
with the governor's office and with
 
00:55:34.549 --> 00:55:34.559 align:start position:0%
uh the speaker and the senate president
 
00:55:34.559 --> 00:55:35.349 align:start position:0%
uh the speaker and the senate president
that

00:55:35.349 --> 00:55:35.359 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:55:38.150 --> 00:55:38.160 align:start position:0%
i think i can make our desires known
 
00:55:40.309 --> 00:55:40.319 align:start position:0%
representative philadelphia
 
00:55:43.510 --> 00:55:43.520 align:start position:0%
yes so i understand that this is going
 
00:55:45.990 --> 00:55:46.000 align:start position:0%
to be part of 25a
 
00:55:49.750 --> 00:55:49.760 align:start position:0%
yes it it if funds
 
00:55:52.630 --> 00:55:52.640 align:start position:0%
if federal funds become available so
 
00:55:53.349 --> 00:55:53.359 align:start position:0%
that'll be
 
00:55:56.870 --> 00:55:56.880 align:start position:0%
that'll be stipulated in 25a
 
00:56:01.030 --> 00:56:01.040 align:start position:0%
excuse me so it'll be stipulated in it
 
00:56:03.670 --> 00:56:03.680 align:start position:0%
and when you rewrite this that those
 
00:56:03.680 --> 00:56:04.309 align:start position:0%
and when you rewrite this that those
projects

00:56:04.309 --> 00:56:04.319 align:start position:0%
projects
 
00:56:09.910 --> 00:56:09.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:14.829 --> 00:56:14.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:17.990 --> 00:56:18.000 align:start position:0%
is uh this section
 
00:56:21.109 --> 00:56:21.119 align:start position:0%
on page nine priority projects list
 
00:56:23.990 --> 00:56:24.000 align:start position:0%
if federal funds become available from
 
00:56:24.870 --> 00:56:24.880 align:start position:0%
the american
 
00:56:28.309 --> 00:56:28.319 align:start position:0%
rescue plan act of 2021
 
00:56:31.030 --> 00:56:31.040 align:start position:0%
the following capital project shall be
 
00:56:32.309 --> 00:56:32.319 align:start position:0%
identified as
 
00:56:35.510 --> 00:56:35.520 align:start position:0%
priority projects for funding
 
00:56:37.750 --> 00:56:37.760 align:start position:0%
whether or not they all get funded or
 
00:56:38.870 --> 00:56:38.880 align:start position:0%
not is
 
00:56:41.510 --> 00:56:41.520 align:start position:0%
is something else mr shea you have your
 
00:56:43.109 --> 00:56:43.119 align:start position:0%
hand up
 
00:56:44.710 --> 00:56:44.720 align:start position:0%
i was just going to piggyback on your
 
00:56:46.549 --> 00:56:46.559 align:start position:0%
comments representative graham and that
 
00:56:48.950 --> 00:56:48.960 align:start position:0%
this list is not binding in any way what
 
00:56:50.870 --> 00:56:50.880 align:start position:0%
it is is a way for the house to put its
 
00:56:50.880 --> 00:56:51.430 align:start position:0%
it is is a way for the house to put its
position

00:56:51.430 --> 00:56:51.440 align:start position:0%
position
 
00:56:53.510 --> 00:56:53.520 align:start position:0%
out there but they would like to see
 
00:56:55.270 --> 00:56:55.280 align:start position:0%
funded for projects if money were to
 
00:56:55.280 --> 00:56:55.829 align:start position:0%
funded for projects if money were to
come

00:56:55.829 --> 00:56:55.839 align:start position:0%
come
 
00:56:58.870 --> 00:56:58.880 align:start position:0%
become available so that that's the
 
00:56:59.990 --> 00:57:00.000 align:start position:0%
whole purpose of the
 
00:57:02.069 --> 00:57:02.079 align:start position:0%
uh section as you see it in the build
 
00:57:02.079 --> 00:57:03.190 align:start position:0%
uh section as you see it in the build
now

00:57:03.190 --> 00:57:03.200 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:57:05.510 --> 00:57:05.520 align:start position:0%
so it doesn't have to do these projects
 
00:57:07.510 --> 00:57:07.520 align:start position:0%
or it does
 
00:57:09.670 --> 00:57:09.680 align:start position:0%
doesn't commit any money to it per se
 
00:57:12.390 --> 00:57:12.400 align:start position:0%
but if money does become available
 
00:57:14.630 --> 00:57:14.640 align:start position:0%
then you then the house has its list out
 
00:57:17.030 --> 00:57:17.040 align:start position:0%
there that it wants to have considered
 
00:57:20.630 --> 00:57:20.640 align:start position:0%
yeah and and if you ever
 
00:57:23.910 --> 00:57:23.920 align:start position:0%
read through house bill 2 there are
 
00:57:25.270 --> 00:57:25.280 align:start position:0%
other sections where
 
00:57:27.430 --> 00:57:27.440 align:start position:0%
if federal funds become available this
 
00:57:29.270 --> 00:57:29.280 align:start position:0%
is what we would like to do
 
00:57:31.589 --> 00:57:31.599 align:start position:0%
we're just taking that a step further
 
00:57:32.549 --> 00:57:32.559 align:start position:0%
and putting it
 
00:57:35.750 --> 00:57:35.760 align:start position:0%
also in the house bill 25 it's probably
 
00:57:37.670 --> 00:57:37.680 align:start position:0%
the first time we've done this
 
00:57:41.510 --> 00:57:41.520 align:start position:0%
but we also know that this is an unusual
 
00:57:43.589 --> 00:57:43.599 align:start position:0%
biennium in the fact that there is going
 
00:57:45.589 --> 00:57:45.599 align:start position:0%
to be some federal money available for
 
00:57:45.599 --> 00:57:46.630 align:start position:0%
to be some federal money available for
projects

00:57:46.630 --> 00:57:46.640 align:start position:0%
projects
 
00:57:49.670 --> 00:57:49.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:52.829 --> 00:57:52.839 align:start position:0%
some comments on on how it should be
 
00:57:52.839 --> 00:57:56.150 align:start position:0%
some comments on on how it should be
spent

00:57:56.150 --> 00:57:56.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:01.910 --> 00:58:01.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:06.069 --> 00:58:06.079 align:start position:0%

yeah i was just going to get to that
okay

00:58:41.270 --> 00:58:41.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:44.549 --> 00:58:44.559 align:start position:0%
representative mcconkey talked
 
00:58:48.870 --> 00:58:48.880 align:start position:0%
earlier about our desire to make sure
 
00:58:51.190 --> 00:58:51.200 align:start position:0%
that the agencies
 
00:58:53.190 --> 00:58:53.200 align:start position:0%
are actually spending the money and
 
00:58:54.390 --> 00:58:54.400 align:start position:0%
spending it
 
00:58:57.589 --> 00:58:57.599 align:start position:0%
the way we want i had
 
00:59:02.829 --> 00:59:02.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:02.839 --> 00:59:04.470 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:59:04.470 --> 00:59:04.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:07.270 --> 00:59:07.280 align:start position:0%
um something along the lines of having a
 
00:59:10.950 --> 00:59:10.960 align:start position:0%
footnote have everybody come in
 
00:59:14.309 --> 00:59:14.319 align:start position:0%
to capital budget overview committee
 
00:59:19.270 --> 00:59:19.280 align:start position:0%
he pointed out that rsa 17-j
 
00:59:23.430 --> 00:59:23.440 align:start position:0%
colon 4 states that each state agency
 
00:59:25.349 --> 00:59:25.359 align:start position:0%
with a capital budget
 
00:59:27.510 --> 00:59:27.520 align:start position:0%
project shall report to the department
 
00:59:30.710 --> 00:59:30.720 align:start position:0%
of administrative services
 
00:59:33.670 --> 00:59:33.680 align:start position:0%
in the format um prescribed for the
 
00:59:35.910 --> 00:59:35.920 align:start position:0%
quarters ending september 30th
 
00:59:40.309 --> 00:59:40.319 align:start position:0%
december 31st march 31st and june 30th
 
00:59:42.710 --> 00:59:42.720 align:start position:0%
all of the agencies are already required
 
00:59:46.150 --> 00:59:46.160 align:start position:0%
to come in quarterly and report
 
00:59:49.349 --> 00:59:49.359 align:start position:0%
what they are doing with our money
 
00:59:51.829 --> 00:59:51.839 align:start position:0%
so there's no need to have an additional
 
00:59:51.839 --> 00:59:53.589 align:start position:0%
so there's no need to have an additional
footnote

00:59:53.589 --> 00:59:53.599 align:start position:0%
footnote
 
00:59:56.390 --> 00:59:56.400 align:start position:0%
as far as having the agencies come in
 
00:59:57.349 --> 00:59:57.359 align:start position:0%
and report
 
00:59:59.670 --> 00:59:59.680 align:start position:0%
if they do not then we can call them in
 
01:00:01.030 --> 01:00:01.040 align:start position:0%
front of
 
01:00:03.430 --> 01:00:03.440 align:start position:0%
the committee to to do that capital
 
01:00:05.270 --> 01:00:05.280 align:start position:0%
budget overview committee
 
01:00:08.870 --> 01:00:08.880 align:start position:0%
which i think i'm the chair um
 
01:00:12.230 --> 01:00:12.240 align:start position:0%
but there is that um there was also
 
01:00:18.150 --> 01:00:18.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:21.190 --> 01:00:21.200 align:start position:0%
commissioner goulet of doit about the
 
01:00:27.750 --> 01:00:27.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:31.750 --> 01:00:31.760 align:start position:0%
reid uh retained in house bill 25 that
 
01:00:33.270 --> 01:00:33.280 align:start position:0%
had been there the last couple of
 
01:00:33.280 --> 01:00:34.470 align:start position:0%
had been there the last couple of
bienniums

01:00:34.470 --> 01:00:34.480 align:start position:0%
bienniums
 
01:00:37.349 --> 01:00:37.359 align:start position:0%
um they authorized him to reallocate
 
01:00:39.190 --> 01:00:39.200 align:start position:0%
funds among the projects
 
01:00:42.390 --> 01:00:42.400 align:start position:0%
within his department um
 
01:00:45.430 --> 01:00:45.440 align:start position:0%
unless somebody has an objection to that
 
01:00:47.670 --> 01:00:47.680 align:start position:0%
it's long-standing if he can move money
 
01:00:50.309 --> 01:00:50.319 align:start position:0%
from cyber security to something else or
 
01:00:52.390 --> 01:00:52.400 align:start position:0%
vice versa
 
01:00:55.430 --> 01:00:55.440 align:start position:0%
he should be able to do that within his
 
01:00:55.440 --> 01:00:58.069 align:start position:0%
he should be able to do that within his
own

01:00:58.069 --> 01:00:58.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:00.470 --> 01:01:00.480 align:start position:0%
department is there any objection to
 
01:01:06.230 --> 01:01:06.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:09.430 --> 01:01:09.440 align:start position:0%
mr chairman i've just got a call on you
 
01:01:13.349 --> 01:01:13.359 align:start position:0%
mark okay thank thank you john
 
01:01:16.230 --> 01:01:16.240 align:start position:0%
um i just want to revisit uh what mr
 
01:01:17.589 --> 01:01:17.599 align:start position:0%
shane said about that
 
01:01:21.030 --> 01:01:21.040 align:start position:0%
footnote and make another repeal here
 
01:01:24.710 --> 01:01:24.720 align:start position:0%
um there have been plenty of times
 
01:01:27.829 --> 01:01:27.839 align:start position:0%
certain agencies more than others uh
 
01:01:29.910 --> 01:01:29.920 align:start position:0%
that they have a reporting requirement
 
01:01:31.190 --> 01:01:31.200 align:start position:0%
and those reports
 
01:01:33.030 --> 01:01:33.040 align:start position:0%
don't end up making their way there i
 
01:01:34.549 --> 01:01:34.559 align:start position:0%
know everybody's doing their best
 
01:01:34.559 --> 01:01:35.589 align:start position:0%
know everybody's doing their best
efforts

01:01:35.589 --> 01:01:35.599 align:start position:0%
efforts
 
01:01:37.349 --> 01:01:37.359 align:start position:0%
is there a harm to still having a
 
01:01:38.950 --> 01:01:38.960 align:start position:0%
footnote in there
 
01:01:41.430 --> 01:01:41.440 align:start position:0%
that those agencies on those i.t
 
01:01:45.030 --> 01:01:45.040 align:start position:0%
projects whether it's des or the others
 
01:01:48.549 --> 01:01:48.559 align:start position:0%
send a report portally to
 
01:01:50.630 --> 01:01:50.640 align:start position:0%
to us directly so that you can
 
01:01:53.109 --> 01:01:53.119 align:start position:0%
distribute that to the
 
01:01:55.589 --> 01:01:55.599 align:start position:0%
to the rest of the capital budget
 
01:01:57.430 --> 01:01:57.440 align:start position:0%
overview committee so that we can see
 
01:01:59.270 --> 01:01:59.280 align:start position:0%
what's happening
 
01:02:01.990 --> 01:02:02.000 align:start position:0%
um you want a separate report from
 
01:02:03.270 --> 01:02:03.280 align:start position:0%
agencies that
 
01:02:08.230 --> 01:02:08.240 align:start position:0%
have i.t um reports are coming quarterly
 
01:02:12.470 --> 01:02:12.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:14.309 --> 01:02:14.319 align:start position:0%
yes i i believe if i followed the
 
01:02:17.109 --> 01:02:17.119 align:start position:0%
conversation from mr shea
 
01:02:19.750 --> 01:02:19.760 align:start position:0%
that they already have to turn that into
 
01:02:19.760 --> 01:02:21.349 align:start position:0%
that they already have to turn that into
public

01:02:21.349 --> 01:02:21.359 align:start position:0%
public
 
01:02:23.829 --> 01:02:23.839 align:start position:0%
in into public works already for that
 
01:02:26.549 --> 01:02:26.559 align:start position:0%
but i think we should be sent a copy and
 
01:02:29.349 --> 01:02:29.359 align:start position:0%
lots as long as it's a footnote on there
 
01:02:31.910 --> 01:02:31.920 align:start position:0%
whether it conflicts or not
 
01:02:34.789 --> 01:02:34.799 align:start position:0%
i i think it allows us also then to go
 
01:02:36.630 --> 01:02:36.640 align:start position:0%
back to the agencies
 
01:02:38.549 --> 01:02:38.559 align:start position:0%
uh when we want and ask for a copy of
 
01:02:40.470 --> 01:02:40.480 align:start position:0%
that report
 
01:02:43.589 --> 01:02:43.599 align:start position:0%
i think mr shea
 
01:02:45.029 --> 01:02:45.039 align:start position:0%
thank you representative graham just a
 
01:02:47.990 --> 01:02:48.000 align:start position:0%
response to represent mcconaughey uh
 
01:02:49.990 --> 01:02:50.000 align:start position:0%
the court of the reports come to capital
 
01:02:51.750 --> 01:02:51.760 align:start position:0%
budget overview
 
01:02:53.190 --> 01:02:53.200 align:start position:0%
so the department of administrative
 
01:02:55.829 --> 01:02:55.839 align:start position:0%
services gets all the information from
 
01:02:58.069 --> 01:02:58.079 align:start position:0%
all agencies that have an appropriation
 
01:02:59.670 --> 01:02:59.680 align:start position:0%
in the capital budget
 
01:03:01.349 --> 01:03:01.359 align:start position:0%
not just the one you're passing now but
 
01:03:03.750 --> 01:03:03.760 align:start position:0%
any open capital projects they have
 
01:03:06.789 --> 01:03:06.799 align:start position:0%
which does include the i.t projects so
 
01:03:08.549 --> 01:03:08.559 align:start position:0%
anything from doit
 
01:03:11.829 --> 01:03:11.839 align:start position:0%
from health and human services um dra
 
01:03:13.910 --> 01:03:13.920 align:start position:0%
for their rims so those are all in that
 
01:03:16.710 --> 01:03:16.720 align:start position:0%
that um spreadsheet that's provided to
 
01:03:18.150 --> 01:03:18.160 align:start position:0%
the capital budget overview on a
 
01:03:19.750 --> 01:03:19.760 align:start position:0%
quarterly basis
 
01:03:22.710 --> 01:03:22.720 align:start position:0%
that report shows you the appropriation
 
01:03:23.990 --> 01:03:24.000 align:start position:0%
the amount that's
 
01:03:25.829 --> 01:03:25.839 align:start position:0%
been spent encumbered the amount
 
01:03:27.270 --> 01:03:27.280 align:start position:0%
remaining and then the status of the
 
01:03:27.280 --> 01:03:28.870 align:start position:0%
remaining and then the status of the
project

01:03:28.870 --> 01:03:28.880 align:start position:0%
project
 
01:03:30.069 --> 01:03:30.079 align:start position:0%
so i don't know if you want something
 
01:03:32.309 --> 01:03:32.319 align:start position:0%
more than that i think to the point that
 
01:03:34.470 --> 01:03:34.480 align:start position:0%
if if there are questions of a certain
 
01:03:35.990 --> 01:03:36.000 align:start position:0%
project the capital budget overview
 
01:03:37.109 --> 01:03:37.119 align:start position:0%
committee has
 
01:03:39.190 --> 01:03:39.200 align:start position:0%
the ability to bring agencies in at any
 
01:03:41.109 --> 01:03:41.119 align:start position:0%
point or to ask them to provide updated
 
01:03:41.119 --> 01:03:42.710 align:start position:0%
point or to ask them to provide updated
information

01:03:42.710 --> 01:03:42.720 align:start position:0%
information
 
01:03:44.069 --> 01:03:44.079 align:start position:0%
that is part of the purview of the
 
01:03:45.750 --> 01:03:45.760 align:start position:0%
committee is to kind of oversee what's
 
01:03:48.309 --> 01:03:48.319 align:start position:0%
going on with a capital project
 
01:03:50.870 --> 01:03:50.880 align:start position:0%
i think that if you put a note in if you
 
01:03:52.630 --> 01:03:52.640 align:start position:0%
put a note in the budget itself i think
 
01:03:54.150 --> 01:03:54.160 align:start position:0%
it may create some confusion because you
 
01:03:56.069 --> 01:03:56.079 align:start position:0%
already have a statutory requirement an
 
01:03:57.589 --> 01:03:57.599 align:start position:0%
agency will be like why are you asking
 
01:03:59.270 --> 01:03:59.280 align:start position:0%
us to do it again
 
01:04:01.670 --> 01:04:01.680 align:start position:0%
um but if you wanted a specific note on
 
01:04:02.789 --> 01:04:02.799 align:start position:0%
an agency
 
01:04:05.109 --> 01:04:05.119 align:start position:0%
for instance the the the roof projects
 
01:04:06.470 --> 01:04:06.480 align:start position:0%
for the parks
 
01:04:07.750 --> 01:04:07.760 align:start position:0%
because you wanted to see what this
 
01:04:09.349 --> 01:04:09.359 align:start position:0%
means very specifically and you wanted
 
01:04:11.349 --> 01:04:11.359 align:start position:0%
them before capital budget overview
 
01:04:13.510 --> 01:04:13.520 align:start position:0%
a note could be uh appropriate for that
 
01:04:16.870 --> 01:04:16.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:19.029 --> 01:04:19.039 align:start position:0%
but okay uh mr williams at the will of
 
01:04:20.630 --> 01:04:20.640 align:start position:0%
the committee we can do whatever you
 
01:04:24.789 --> 01:04:24.799 align:start position:0%
ask us to do thank you mr shave mr
 
01:04:24.799 --> 01:04:25.829 align:start position:0%
ask us to do thank you mr shave mr
chairman

01:04:25.829 --> 01:04:25.839 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
01:04:28.390 --> 01:04:28.400 align:start position:0%
could i ask that uh specifically on on
 
01:04:30.069 --> 01:04:30.079 align:start position:0%
the roof projects
 
01:04:33.510 --> 01:04:33.520 align:start position:0%
and uh des on the on the one-stop
 
01:04:36.230 --> 01:04:36.240 align:start position:0%
project that we get such an update sent
 
01:04:39.029 --> 01:04:39.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:41.670 --> 01:04:41.680 align:start position:0%
can we do that if we if we could do that
 
01:04:42.950 --> 01:04:42.960 align:start position:0%
mr shea
 
01:04:44.870 --> 01:04:44.880 align:start position:0%
especially since we've increased the
 
01:04:46.230 --> 01:04:46.240 align:start position:0%
money for
 
01:04:50.069 --> 01:04:50.079 align:start position:0%
um natural cultural resources for
 
01:04:53.029 --> 01:04:53.039 align:start position:0%
uh repairs and roofing that if they
 
01:04:54.870 --> 01:04:54.880 align:start position:0%
could provide a separate list of what
 
01:04:56.549 --> 01:04:56.559 align:start position:0%
they are
 
01:04:59.589 --> 01:04:59.599 align:start position:0%
are doing with that money
 
01:05:01.270 --> 01:05:01.280 align:start position:0%
yeah we can we can certainly put a note
 
01:05:03.349 --> 01:05:03.359 align:start position:0%
in and um do you want it on a quarterly
 
01:05:05.349 --> 01:05:05.359 align:start position:0%
basis or a six-month
 
01:05:07.109 --> 01:05:07.119 align:start position:0%
so you could put a note similar to what
 
01:05:08.549 --> 01:05:08.559 align:start position:0%
you have on the rails
 
01:05:10.630 --> 01:05:10.640 align:start position:0%
yeah six months i think capital budget
 
01:05:12.470 --> 01:05:12.480 align:start position:0%
overview every six months
 
01:05:15.750 --> 01:05:15.760 align:start position:0%
yeah and then if you want them
 
01:05:17.430 --> 01:05:17.440 align:start position:0%
sooner than that you can you can put a
 
01:05:19.750 --> 01:05:19.760 align:start position:0%
request in for that
 
01:05:22.630 --> 01:05:22.640 align:start position:0%
yeah there's no point having somewhat
 
01:05:22.640 --> 01:05:23.190 align:start position:0%
yeah there's no point having somewhat
yeah

01:05:23.190 --> 01:05:23.200 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:05:26.630 --> 01:05:26.640 align:start position:0%
six months let's do it that way
 
01:05:31.990 --> 01:05:32.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:34.470 --> 01:05:34.480 align:start position:0%
mr chairman yeah just just just to
 
01:05:35.990 --> 01:05:36.000 align:start position:0%
finish up i wanted to make sure
 
01:05:39.109 --> 01:05:39.119 align:start position:0%
that uh des with the one stop project
 
01:05:40.549 --> 01:05:40.559 align:start position:0%
was treated the same way
 
01:05:43.190 --> 01:05:43.200 align:start position:0%
that's a that's a monster project that's
 
01:05:45.190 --> 01:05:45.200 align:start position:0%
been worked on for years and years i'd
 
01:05:46.789 --> 01:05:46.799 align:start position:0%
just like to make sure it's moving in
 
01:05:49.829 --> 01:05:49.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:52.230 --> 01:05:52.240 align:start position:0%
we could do that as well mr schneiderlin
 
01:05:54.549 --> 01:05:54.559 align:start position:0%
my understanding is you want to know the
 
01:05:55.990 --> 01:05:56.000 align:start position:0%
committee would like to know
 
01:05:59.029 --> 01:05:59.039 align:start position:0%

01:06:02.870 --> 01:06:02.880 align:start position:0%
excuse me in the one stop
 
01:06:07.270 --> 01:06:07.280 align:start position:0%

01:07:55.510 --> 01:07:55.520 align:start position:0%
been scheduled our first
 
01:07:57.750 --> 01:07:57.760 align:start position:0%

early
 
01:08:02.789 --> 01:08:02.799 align:start position:0%
right members of the committee who are
 
01:08:04.549 --> 01:08:04.559 align:start position:0%

and just watch us
 
01:08:09.990 --> 01:08:10.000 align:start position:0%

i just want to put that plug in for the
 
01:08:13.029 --> 01:08:13.039 align:start position:0%
capital which is very important
 
01:08:13.039 --> 01:08:15.270 align:start position:0%
capital which is very important
committee

01:08:15.270 --> 01:08:15.280 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:08:18.709 --> 01:08:18.719 align:start position:0%
that in long range that right yes
 
01:08:21.669 --> 01:08:21.679 align:start position:0%
meeting that early is to get the
 
01:08:21.679 --> 01:08:22.829 align:start position:0%

senators
 
01:08:26.630 --> 01:08:26.640 align:start position:0%
there and since we're different i assume
 
01:08:29.669 --> 01:08:29.679 align:start position:0%
representative abbott yes thank you mr
 
01:08:30.470 --> 01:08:30.480 align:start position:0%
chairman i'd
 
01:08:33.910 --> 01:08:33.920 align:start position:0%
i'd just like to uh second
 
01:08:38.229 --> 01:08:38.239 align:start position:0%
with representative mcconkie's said
 
01:08:38.239 --> 01:08:38.709 align:start position:0%
with representative mcconkie's said
about

01:08:38.709 --> 01:08:38.719 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:08:41.910 --> 01:08:41.920 align:start position:0%
the recording schedule and i i think
 
01:08:44.870 --> 01:08:44.880 align:start position:0%
if we know that you're going to be on
 
01:08:46.870 --> 01:08:46.880 align:start position:0%
the oversight committee
 
01:08:49.269 --> 01:08:49.279 align:start position:0%
uh that shouldn't be a problem but i
 
01:08:50.870 --> 01:08:50.880 align:start position:0%
just yeah
 
01:08:53.910 --> 01:08:53.920 align:start position:0%
let me look put it this way myself
 
01:08:56.550 --> 01:08:56.560 align:start position:0%
representative mcconkey representative
 
01:08:56.560 --> 01:08:57.510 align:start position:0%
representative mcconkey representative
clutier

01:08:57.510 --> 01:08:57.520 align:start position:0%
clutier
 
01:09:00.309 --> 01:09:00.319 align:start position:0%
our members and representative mills is
 
01:09:01.349 --> 01:09:01.359 align:start position:0%
an alternate
 
01:09:04.709 --> 01:09:04.719 align:start position:0%
so we have half of the house members on
 
01:09:08.229 --> 01:09:08.239 align:start position:0%
that committee the other half come from
 
01:09:10.789 --> 01:09:10.799 align:start position:0%
um if i remember correct i have to look
 
01:09:12.709 --> 01:09:12.719 align:start position:0%
i think it's all finance but
 
01:09:16.709 --> 01:09:16.719 align:start position:0%
um we are uh well represented
 
01:09:20.229 --> 01:09:20.239 align:start position:0%
and uh the chair is always on
 
01:09:23.349 --> 01:09:23.359 align:start position:0%
on that committee so um that's the only
 
01:09:24.070 --> 01:09:24.080 align:start position:0%
reason i knew
 
01:09:28.390 --> 01:09:28.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:31.669 --> 01:09:31.679 align:start position:0%
any other questions um
 
01:09:36.630 --> 01:09:36.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:39.910 --> 01:09:39.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:42.950 --> 01:09:42.960 align:start position:0%

other than you should be using it to
check

01:10:00.390 --> 01:10:00.400 align:start position:0%

representative include here uh yes mr
 
01:15:39.910 --> 01:15:39.920 align:start position:0%
chairman and
 
01:15:41.669 --> 01:15:41.679 align:start position:0%
uh representative mills gray's is a good
 
01:15:43.030 --> 01:15:43.040 align:start position:0%
point but should we just
 
01:15:45.669 --> 01:15:45.679 align:start position:0%
maybe make sure christie is he's working
 
01:15:46.790 --> 01:15:46.800 align:start position:0%
on the amendment so
 
01:15:48.630 --> 01:15:48.640 align:start position:0%
if we someone spots an amendment make
 
01:15:50.790 --> 01:15:50.800 align:start position:0%
sure he's included on the email to
 
01:15:51.990 --> 01:15:52.000 align:start position:0%
either one that would be
 
01:15:55.030 --> 01:15:55.040 align:start position:0%
my only suggestion great point because
 
01:15:57.830 --> 01:15:57.840 align:start position:0%
if it's a dollar amount difference if
 
01:15:58.950 --> 01:15:58.960 align:start position:0%
somehow the
 
01:16:04.070 --> 01:16:04.080 align:start position:0%
it something just doesn't look right
 
01:16:07.350 --> 01:16:07.360 align:start position:0%
it would be useful but make sure
 
01:16:11.750 --> 01:16:11.760 align:start position:0%
that um if you're doing that um
 
01:16:14.950 --> 01:16:14.960 align:start position:0%
that at least i know so i i
 
01:16:17.590 --> 01:16:17.600 align:start position:0%
i hate being surprised i think every
 
01:16:19.189 --> 01:16:19.199 align:start position:0%
everyone does
 
01:16:22.229 --> 01:16:22.239 align:start position:0%
uh not like that um but
 
01:16:23.750 --> 01:16:23.760 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you representative mills
 
01:16:25.510 --> 01:16:25.520 align:start position:0%
that's a good point thank you and
 
01:16:29.110 --> 01:16:29.120 align:start position:0%
and the thing is i will say
 
01:16:31.189 --> 01:16:31.199 align:start position:0%
that what representative mills said is
 
01:16:33.990 --> 01:16:34.000 align:start position:0%
right if we come in thursday
 
01:16:36.709 --> 01:16:36.719 align:start position:0%
and we have to get a new amendment done
 
01:16:37.750 --> 01:16:37.760 align:start position:0%
which is what it
 
01:16:41.510 --> 01:16:41.520 align:start position:0%
will take we will um
 
01:16:44.870 --> 01:16:44.880 align:start position:0%
recess until that new one is done
 
01:16:47.110 --> 01:16:47.120 align:start position:0%

01:16:48.870 --> 01:16:48.880 align:start position:0%

01:18:41.189 --> 01:18:41.199 align:start position:0%
we will you will see a new one mr shea i
 
01:18:43.350 --> 01:18:43.360 align:start position:0%
think we can send out a new one
 
01:18:45.830 --> 01:18:45.840 align:start position:0%
based on the couple changes from today
 
01:18:47.430 --> 01:18:47.440 align:start position:0%
to the committee
 
01:18:50.950 --> 01:18:50.960 align:start position:0%
um we will see one yes
 
01:18:52.310 --> 01:18:52.320 align:start position:0%
i think one thing would be helpful is to
 
01:18:54.709 --> 01:18:54.719 align:start position:0%
see the uh the allocation of the lapse
 
01:18:57.750 --> 01:18:57.760 align:start position:0%
funds on the same or the next line
 
01:19:00.709 --> 01:19:00.719 align:start position:0%
if if we have it split especially just
 
01:19:02.470 --> 01:19:02.480 align:start position:0%
so we can we can see the whole project
 
01:19:02.480 --> 01:19:02.870 align:start position:0%
so we can we can see the whole project
uh

01:19:02.870 --> 01:19:02.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:19:06.229 --> 01:19:06.239 align:start position:0%
together uh you know
 
01:19:08.630 --> 01:19:08.640 align:start position:0%
list the bond the general bond funds on
 
01:19:10.310 --> 01:19:10.320 align:start position:0%
one line and list the
 
01:19:14.310 --> 01:19:14.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:17.750 --> 01:19:17.760 align:start position:0%
okay i'll talk with mr shea about about
 
01:19:20.229 --> 01:19:20.239 align:start position:0%
something like that but as far as what
 
01:19:21.430 --> 01:19:21.440 align:start position:0%
the senate does
 
01:19:23.590 --> 01:19:23.600 align:start position:0%
we won't see that compare report until
 
01:19:25.110 --> 01:19:25.120 align:start position:0%
the senate
 
01:19:27.030 --> 01:19:27.040 align:start position:0%
is finished and we're headed towards a
 
01:19:28.149 --> 01:19:28.159 align:start position:0%
committee conference
 
01:19:30.870 --> 01:19:30.880 align:start position:0%
mr shea thank you representative graham
 
01:19:33.750 --> 01:19:33.760 align:start position:0%
what i could do on the compare report is
 
01:19:36.310 --> 01:19:36.320 align:start position:0%
um after the project in on the same line
 
01:19:37.910 --> 01:19:37.920 align:start position:0%
that the project's named if it's
 
01:19:40.550 --> 01:19:40.560 align:start position:0%
there's money in the um lapsed
 
01:19:41.910 --> 01:19:41.920 align:start position:0%
repurposed money
 
01:19:43.590 --> 01:19:43.600 align:start position:0%
i can just put a note to say the amount
 
01:19:45.030 --> 01:19:45.040 align:start position:0%
so for instance the uh
 
01:19:48.390 --> 01:19:48.400 align:start position:0%
the flood modeling project
 
01:19:52.149 --> 01:19:52.159 align:start position:0%
note after that to say that there's 189
 
01:19:54.149 --> 01:19:54.159 align:start position:0%
000 or whatever the amount was that's
 
01:19:56.390 --> 01:19:56.400 align:start position:0%
under the repurposed section
 
01:19:59.510 --> 01:19:59.520 align:start position:0%
and give you the section number
 
01:20:01.270 --> 01:20:01.280 align:start position:0%
that that will work i think that's
 
01:20:01.280 --> 01:20:03.510 align:start position:0%
that that will work i think that's
helpful

01:20:03.510 --> 01:20:03.520 align:start position:0%
helpful
 
01:20:06.550 --> 01:20:06.560 align:start position:0%
representative jack uh yeah the one item
 
01:20:07.189 --> 01:20:07.199 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
01:20:08.629 --> 01:20:08.639 align:start position:0%
doesn't show up at all in the compare
 
01:20:11.110 --> 01:20:11.120 align:start position:0%
report that's uh big is the turning
 
01:20:11.120 --> 01:20:11.669 align:start position:0%
report that's uh big is the turning
basin

01:20:11.669 --> 01:20:11.679 align:start position:0%
basin
 
01:20:13.270 --> 01:20:13.280 align:start position:0%
and we didn't even discuss it this
 
01:20:13.280 --> 01:20:15.830 align:start position:0%
and we didn't even discuss it this
morning

01:20:15.830 --> 01:20:15.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:20.390 --> 01:20:20.400 align:start position:0%
um that shows up in the back
 
01:20:23.590 --> 01:20:23.600 align:start position:0%
it is fully funded through
 
01:20:27.669 --> 01:20:27.679 align:start position:0%
um um repurposing money
 
01:20:30.470 --> 01:20:30.480 align:start position:0%
and from lapses yeah it shows up back
 
01:20:30.480 --> 01:20:31.350 align:start position:0%
and from lapses yeah it shows up back
there

01:20:31.350 --> 01:20:31.360 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:20:34.629 --> 01:20:34.639 align:start position:0%
um and so
 
01:20:38.229 --> 01:20:38.239 align:start position:0%
it it would not show up in a compare
 
01:20:38.239 --> 01:20:39.030 align:start position:0%
it it would not show up in a compare
report
