would everybody be good with just
 
00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:38.240 align:start position:0%
starting off with the original bill 1661
 
00:06:40.629 --> 00:06:40.639 align:start position:0%
see if we can agree with that
 
00:06:40.639 --> 00:06:41.510 align:start position:0%
see if we can agree with that
and

00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:41.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:43.280 align:start position:0%
there is an amendment
 
00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:46.080 align:start position:0%
uh which uh parallels that what happened
 
00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:48.000 align:start position:0%
is that when we approved this in
 
00:06:49.749 --> 00:06:49.759 align:start position:0%
education committee in the house it was
 
00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:51.520 align:start position:0%
approved 19-0
 
00:06:53.589 --> 00:06:53.599 align:start position:0%
went to the house floor
 
00:06:53.599 --> 00:06:54.870 align:start position:0%
went to the house floor
was

00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:54.880 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:06:57.270 --> 00:06:57.280 align:start position:0%
approved on consent calendar no
 
00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:00.400 align:start position:0%
objections to the cte bill cte bill has
 
00:07:02.629 --> 00:07:02.639 align:start position:0%
several purposes one
 
00:07:02.639 --> 00:07:03.510 align:start position:0%
several purposes one
it

00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:03.520 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:05.520 align:start position:0%
aligns scheduling between the sending
 
00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:08.000 align:start position:0%
schools and the receiving center
 
00:07:09.909 --> 00:07:09.919 align:start position:0%
we have students missing a lot of days
 
00:07:11.909 --> 00:07:11.919 align:start position:0%
because calendars are not aligned and we
 
00:07:13.670 --> 00:07:13.680 align:start position:0%
finally have gotten something together
 
00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:16.160 align:start position:0%
here to try to help that out and
 
00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:18.720 align:start position:0%
secondly it allows
 
00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:21.840 align:start position:0%
students to get pupils to get credit for
 
00:07:24.790 --> 00:07:24.800 align:start position:0%
the graduation credit through the cte
 
00:07:27.589 --> 00:07:27.599 align:start position:0%
course or program which they are taking
 
00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:29.840 align:start position:0%
this has restricted some from
 
00:07:31.909 --> 00:07:31.919 align:start position:0%
participating in these skill pathways
 
00:07:33.749 --> 00:07:33.759 align:start position:0%
they have to remain behind in the
 
00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:36.240 align:start position:0%
sending high school to receive that one
 
00:07:38.309 --> 00:07:38.319 align:start position:0%
credit they need for carnegie unit to
 
00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:40.080 align:start position:0%
get out of the school
 
00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:41.840 align:start position:0%
now they can it's it's going to be
 
00:07:44.629 --> 00:07:44.639 align:start position:0%
embedded in as a competency in a course
 
00:07:46.869 --> 00:07:46.879 align:start position:0%
or through that cte program
 
00:07:49.110 --> 00:07:49.120 align:start position:0%
the amendment which you see there
 
00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:50.469 align:start position:0%
the amendment which you see there
clarifies

00:07:50.469 --> 00:07:50.479 align:start position:0%
clarifies
 
00:07:51.670 --> 00:07:51.680 align:start position:0%
how that
 
00:07:53.990 --> 00:07:54.000 align:start position:0%
competency is to be approved
 
00:07:56.469 --> 00:07:56.479 align:start position:0%
we had initially that could be done by
 
00:07:58.230 --> 00:07:58.240 align:start position:0%
the state board of education as well
 
00:08:01.029 --> 00:08:01.039 align:start position:0%
that state board is out of this it's up
 
00:08:03.189 --> 00:08:03.199 align:start position:0%
to the local school district school
 
00:08:06.790 --> 00:08:06.800 align:start position:0%
board who who approves the graduation
 
00:08:09.589 --> 00:08:09.599 align:start position:0%
credits for that school district and the
 
00:08:12.869 --> 00:08:12.879 align:start position:0%
receiving center through the rctea the
 
00:08:15.110 --> 00:08:15.120 align:start position:0%
agreement to work out
 
00:08:17.350 --> 00:08:17.360 align:start position:0%
the competencies how they're going to be
 
00:08:21.029 --> 00:08:21.039 align:start position:0%
uh dealt with that at the center
 
00:08:22.469 --> 00:08:22.479 align:start position:0%
it's something that's really needed we
 
00:08:24.550 --> 00:08:24.560 align:start position:0%
worked with the directors they all
 
00:08:27.189 --> 00:08:27.199 align:start position:0%
were good with that and um
 
00:08:30.830 --> 00:08:30.840 align:start position:0%

00:08:33.990 --> 00:08:34.000 align:start position:0%

legislative parking garage
 
00:09:56.150 --> 00:09:56.160 align:start position:0%
edition which also came out of the the
 
00:09:59.030 --> 00:09:59.040 align:start position:0%
house finance and approved by the house
 
00:10:01.509 --> 00:10:01.519 align:start position:0%
um any discussion on that
 
00:10:03.750 --> 00:10:03.760 align:start position:0%
i would move that the house asceed to
 
00:10:09.990 --> 00:10:10.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:12.310 --> 00:10:12.320 align:start position:0%

00:10:14.710 --> 00:10:14.720 align:start position:0%
we support the parking garage i want to
 
00:10:17.190 --> 00:10:17.200 align:start position:0%
make it clear but i think that
 
00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:18.870 align:start position:0%
make it clear but i think that
discussion

00:10:18.870 --> 00:10:18.880 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:22.790 align:start position:0%
discussion
um

00:10:22.790 --> 00:10:22.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:25.030 --> 00:10:25.040 align:start position:0%
we may want to talk about
 
00:10:30.550 --> 00:10:30.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:34.470 --> 00:10:34.480 align:start position:0%
if i go ahead if i might um
 
00:10:36.790 --> 00:10:36.800 align:start position:0%
i believe that the uh
 
00:10:39.590 --> 00:10:39.600 align:start position:0%
the house thinks that uh
 
00:10:42.230 --> 00:10:42.240 align:start position:0%
we will have time
 
00:10:44.870 --> 00:10:44.880 align:start position:0%
uh after the engineering study is
 
00:10:47.990 --> 00:10:48.000 align:start position:0%
completed and the um
 
00:10:50.710 --> 00:10:50.720 align:start position:0%
and the work is uh
 
00:10:52.389 --> 00:10:52.399 align:start position:0%
you know that we're ready to start
 
00:10:52.399 --> 00:10:53.590 align:start position:0%
you know that we're ready to start
building

00:10:53.590 --> 00:10:53.600 align:start position:0%
building
 
00:10:56.470 --> 00:10:56.480 align:start position:0%
that there will be ample time
 
00:10:58.949 --> 00:10:58.959 align:start position:0%
and dollars available
 
00:10:58.959 --> 00:11:00.630 align:start position:0%
and dollars available
to

00:11:00.630 --> 00:11:00.640 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:11:04.870 --> 00:11:04.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:08.069 --> 00:11:08.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:12.310 --> 00:11:12.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:18.310 --> 00:11:18.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:19.350 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:11:19.350 --> 00:11:19.360 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:20.310 align:start position:0%
okay
so

00:11:20.310 --> 00:11:20.320 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:11:22.069 --> 00:11:22.079 align:start position:0%
we're we're good to deferring it and
 
00:11:24.310 --> 00:11:24.320 align:start position:0%
it's so we were at the place where we're
 
00:11:26.470 --> 00:11:26.480 align:start position:0%
all accepting of the
 
00:11:28.470 --> 00:11:28.480 align:start position:0%
i think the the question is is there
 
00:11:31.509 --> 00:11:31.519 align:start position:0%
some other number the 9.3
 
00:11:37.190 --> 00:11:37.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:39.269 --> 00:11:39.279 align:start position:0%
so then let's let's move beyond this now
 
00:11:41.990 --> 00:11:42.000 align:start position:0%
and get into the remainder of the bills
 
00:11:43.750 --> 00:11:43.760 align:start position:0%
senator bradley knows where there's some
 
00:11:49.269 --> 00:11:49.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:51.750 --> 00:11:51.760 align:start position:0%
if if i could mr chairman starting on
 
00:11:54.389 --> 00:11:54.399 align:start position:0%
section 8
 
00:11:55.750 --> 00:11:55.760 align:start position:0%
that is
 
00:11:58.629 --> 00:11:58.639 align:start position:0%
my bill senate bill 430
 
00:12:01.829 --> 00:12:01.839 align:start position:0%
um it is as the
 
00:12:04.150 --> 00:12:04.160 align:start position:0%
senate passed it
 
00:12:07.750 --> 00:12:07.760 align:start position:0%
i have spoken with mr williams um

00:12:13.430 --> 00:12:13.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:15.670 --> 00:12:15.680 align:start position:0%

amendment but i believe
 
00:12:29.829 --> 00:12:29.839 align:start position:0%

00:12:38.150 --> 00:12:38.160 align:start position:0%
nope not section 29 which is the section
 
00:12:43.829 --> 00:12:43.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:47.350 --> 00:12:47.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:48.949 --> 00:12:48.959 align:start position:0%
this for the
 
00:12:53.190 --> 00:12:53.200 align:start position:0%
this this meeting is being streamed
 
00:12:57.509 --> 00:12:57.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:03.110 --> 00:13:03.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:04.230 align:start position:0%

thank you
 
00:13:08.069 --> 00:13:08.079 align:start position:0%
um so yes the the department uh
 
00:13:10.949 --> 00:13:10.959 align:start position:0%
certainly um is fine with the provisions
 
00:13:12.389 --> 00:13:12.399 align:start position:0%
as passed by the house by both the
 
00:13:14.790 --> 00:13:14.800 align:start position:0%
policy committee as well as the house
 
00:13:17.670 --> 00:13:17.680 align:start position:0%
finance committee uh recommendations
 
00:13:19.509 --> 00:13:19.519 align:start position:0%
however there was a provision with the
 
00:13:19.519 --> 00:13:20.550 align:start position:0%
however there was a provision with the
caveat

00:13:20.550 --> 00:13:20.560 align:start position:0%
caveat
 
00:13:22.710 --> 00:13:22.720 align:start position:0%
there was a provision in the bill as
 
00:13:25.509 --> 00:13:25.519 align:start position:0%
passed by the policy committee initially
 
00:13:27.910 --> 00:13:27.920 align:start position:0%
that dealt with the confidentiality of
 
00:13:30.389 --> 00:13:30.399 align:start position:0%
information at child protection actions
 
00:13:32.710 --> 00:13:32.720 align:start position:0%
in court proceedings and under current
 
00:13:34.550 --> 00:13:34.560 align:start position:0%
law it's a misdemeanor provision for
 
00:13:37.910 --> 00:13:37.920 align:start position:0%
violating that provision and the house
 
00:13:39.910 --> 00:13:39.920 align:start position:0%
uh presented an amendment that would
 
00:13:41.670 --> 00:13:41.680 align:start position:0%
change that to a violation that was the
 
00:13:44.310 --> 00:13:44.320 align:start position:0%
only item that we were hoping your
 
00:13:47.829 --> 00:13:47.839 align:start position:0%
consideration as conferees
 
00:13:50.389 --> 00:13:50.399 align:start position:0%
great uh which section was that john i
 
00:13:53.910 --> 00:13:53.920 align:start position:0%
believe if you go to the house it's page
 
00:13:57.509 --> 00:13:57.519 align:start position:0%
17 and section 62 at least as it came
 
00:14:01.430 --> 00:14:01.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:05.509 --> 00:14:05.519 align:start position:0%
if you look at the bill it's on page 17
 
00:14:10.949 --> 00:14:10.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:14.150 --> 00:14:14.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:16.710 --> 00:14:16.720 align:start position:0%
and that was section 62 that senator
 
00:14:38.870 --> 00:14:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:41.829 --> 00:14:41.839 align:start position:0%

00:14:56.629 --> 00:14:56.639 align:start position:0%

00:15:48.550 --> 00:15:48.560 align:start position:0%
and non-concurred hat it didn't contain
 
00:15:49.590 --> 00:15:49.600 align:start position:0%
a uh
 
00:15:50.949 --> 00:15:50.959 align:start position:0%
floor amendment

that he wants are you in the side by
 
00:16:03.350 --> 00:16:03.360 align:start position:0%
side right now
 
00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:04.230 align:start position:0%
side right now
so

00:16:04.230 --> 00:16:04.240 align:start position:0%

00:16:07.269 --> 00:16:07.279 align:start position:0%
i'm on page 26 on that
 
00:16:07.279 --> 00:16:08.710 align:start position:0%
i'm on page 26 on that
um

00:16:08.710 --> 00:16:08.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:10.710 --> 00:16:10.720 align:start position:0%
if you were talking about
 
00:16:12.790 --> 00:16:12.800 align:start position:0%
if we were talking about section 62
 
00:16:15.990 --> 00:16:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:17.509 align:start position:0%
 
no

00:16:17.509 --> 00:16:17.519 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:16:19.749 --> 00:16:19.759 align:start position:0%
that's not the section okay that's not
 
00:16:26.949 --> 00:16:26.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:31.030 --> 00:16:31.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:33.350 --> 00:16:33.360 align:start position:0%
i think we have copies of the
 
00:16:37.509 --> 00:16:37.519 align:start position:0%
version as passed by the house that
 
00:16:55.829 --> 00:16:55.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:00.069 --> 00:17:00.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:03.430 --> 00:17:03.440 align:start position:0%
believe it's page 24.
 
00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:22.230 align:start position:0%
believe it's page 24.
okay

00:17:22.230 --> 00:17:22.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:24.150 --> 00:17:24.160 align:start position:0%
so i'm looking at a side by side you'll
 
00:17:26.390 --> 00:17:26.400 align:start position:0%
be looking at page 24
 
00:17:29.110 --> 00:17:29.120 align:start position:0%
at the top of that page
 
00:17:30.789 --> 00:17:30.799 align:start position:0%
a house version
 
00:17:32.950 --> 00:17:32.960 align:start position:0%
section 62
 
00:17:35.909 --> 00:17:35.919 align:start position:0%
which deals with uh shall be guilty of a
 
00:17:35.919 --> 00:17:43.669 align:start position:0%
which deals with uh shall be guilty of a
violation

00:17:43.669 --> 00:17:43.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:43.679 --> 00:17:44.470 align:start position:0%
 
yes

00:17:44.470 --> 00:17:44.480 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:17:47.190 --> 00:17:47.200 align:start position:0%
that is correct it in the center pass
 
00:17:49.190 --> 00:17:49.200 align:start position:0%
version with all the amendments it's a
 
00:17:51.350 --> 00:17:51.360 align:start position:0%
different section that's all but
 
00:17:53.190 --> 00:17:53.200 align:start position:0%
this is the one where there is a
 
00:17:55.350 --> 00:17:55.360 align:start position:0%
question from the department
 
00:17:57.110 --> 00:17:57.120 align:start position:0%
they would prefer to keep it at
 
00:17:57.120 --> 00:18:01.990 align:start position:0%
they would prefer to keep it at
misdemeanor

00:18:01.990 --> 00:18:02.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:04.310 --> 00:18:04.320 align:start position:0%
further discussion from the community
 
00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:05.270 align:start position:0%
further discussion from the community
conference

00:18:05.270 --> 00:18:05.280 align:start position:0%
conference
 
00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:07.190 align:start position:0%
conference
members

00:18:07.190 --> 00:18:07.200 align:start position:0%
members
 
00:18:09.590 --> 00:18:09.600 align:start position:0%
go ahead thank you mr chair um to uh
 
00:18:12.549 --> 00:18:12.559 align:start position:0%
senator hennessy's question on the
 
00:18:15.029 --> 00:18:15.039 align:start position:0%
paper that was just passed out
 
00:18:17.110 --> 00:18:17.120 align:start position:0%
it would be on page 18 down at the
 
00:18:19.830 --> 00:18:19.840 align:start position:0%
bottom and again i'm i haven't had the
 
00:18:21.750 --> 00:18:21.760 align:start position:0%
time to look at the entire side by side
 
00:18:23.990 --> 00:18:24.000 align:start position:0%
i do believe we need more time for that
 
00:18:26.549 --> 00:18:26.559 align:start position:0%
but at the bottom of page 18 uh section
 
00:18:30.230 --> 00:18:30.240 align:start position:0%
64 is the amen floor amendment that
 
00:18:32.310 --> 00:18:32.320 align:start position:0%
the house added and that was the one
 
00:18:35.430 --> 00:18:35.440 align:start position:0%
sent over to the senate and it was a
 
00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:37.750 align:start position:0%
sent over to the senate and it was a
non-concur

00:18:37.750 --> 00:18:37.760 align:start position:0%
non-concur
 
00:18:42.950 --> 00:18:42.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:45.029 --> 00:18:45.039 align:start position:0%
it appears that we would like to have
 
00:18:47.510 --> 00:18:47.520 align:start position:0%
more may i think yeah
 
00:18:48.549 --> 00:18:48.559 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:18:48.559 --> 00:18:53.350 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

00:18:53.350 --> 00:18:53.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:57.669 --> 00:18:57.679 align:start position:0%
i guess i'm confused about why
 
00:19:00.310 --> 00:19:00.320 align:start position:0%
we would want that to be a
 
00:19:04.310 --> 00:19:04.320 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor rather than a violation
 
00:19:06.630 --> 00:19:06.640 align:start position:0%
i is
 
00:19:09.590 --> 00:19:09.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:11.430 --> 00:19:11.440 align:start position:0%
does the department have a response to
 
00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:19.270 align:start position:0%
does the department have a response to
that

00:19:19.270 --> 00:19:19.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:20.710 --> 00:19:20.720 align:start position:0%
chairman ladd in response to
 
00:19:22.789 --> 00:19:22.799 align:start position:0%
representative umberger's question the
 
00:19:24.310 --> 00:19:24.320 align:start position:0%
current law does provide for a
 
00:19:26.310 --> 00:19:26.320 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor provision it's been in place
 
00:19:28.630 --> 00:19:28.640 align:start position:0%
for several years
 
00:19:30.070 --> 00:19:30.080 align:start position:0%
and it's worked quite well to protect
 
00:19:32.950 --> 00:19:32.960 align:start position:0%
the confidentiality of the matters
 
00:19:35.270 --> 00:19:35.280 align:start position:0%
involving abuse and neglect or child
 
00:19:37.190 --> 00:19:37.200 align:start position:0%
protection matters before
 
00:19:39.909 --> 00:19:39.919 align:start position:0%
the court it protects the privacy of the
 
00:19:39.919 --> 00:19:40.870 align:start position:0%
the court it protects the privacy of the
child

00:19:40.870 --> 00:19:40.880 align:start position:0%
child
 
00:19:42.950 --> 00:19:42.960 align:start position:0%
the privacy of the family and it's
 
00:19:45.350 --> 00:19:45.360 align:start position:0%
something that we feel should still
 
00:19:46.950 --> 00:19:46.960 align:start position:0%
continue to be in place
 
00:19:49.830 --> 00:19:49.840 align:start position:0%
although it was provided as an amendment
 
00:19:51.750 --> 00:19:51.760 align:start position:0%
at the house policy committee it never
 
00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:52.549 align:start position:0%
at the house policy committee it never
had

00:19:52.549 --> 00:19:52.559 align:start position:0%
had
 
00:19:53.909 --> 00:19:53.919 align:start position:0%
a full hearing on it because it was
 
00:19:55.190 --> 00:19:55.200 align:start position:0%
determined it was germaine to the
 
00:19:57.190 --> 00:19:57.200 align:start position:0%
underlying bill and perhaps a more
 
00:19:59.590 --> 00:19:59.600 align:start position:0%
robust conversation to review
 
00:20:01.510 --> 00:20:01.520 align:start position:0%
what the consequences could be relative
 
00:20:03.029 --> 00:20:03.039 align:start position:0%
to changing it from a misdemeanor to a
 
00:20:04.870 --> 00:20:04.880 align:start position:0%
violation might include
 
00:20:06.390 --> 00:20:06.400 align:start position:0%
i do recall that there was some
 
00:20:08.230 --> 00:20:08.240 align:start position:0%
commentary or perhaps confusion that the
 
00:20:10.470 --> 00:20:10.480 align:start position:0%
application of that statute would only
 
00:20:13.750 --> 00:20:13.760 align:start position:0%
uh be to either parents or parties to
 
00:20:15.990 --> 00:20:16.000 align:start position:0%
the action and and not the department
 
00:20:18.390 --> 00:20:18.400 align:start position:0%
and if you actually have it reviewed by
 
00:20:21.110 --> 00:20:21.120 align:start position:0%
attorney four you'll see that it applies
 
00:20:22.870 --> 00:20:22.880 align:start position:0%
to all individuals who are involved in
 
00:20:24.630 --> 00:20:24.640 align:start position:0%
those actions including the department
 
00:20:26.070 --> 00:20:26.080 align:start position:0%
of health and services so there was some
 
00:20:27.590 --> 00:20:27.600 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding in terms of the scope
 
00:20:29.350 --> 00:20:29.360 align:start position:0%
of this application
 
00:20:31.350 --> 00:20:31.360 align:start position:0%
also for clarity uh the department as
 
00:20:33.510 --> 00:20:33.520 align:start position:0%
they stated was fine with the bill as it
 
00:20:35.990 --> 00:20:36.000 align:start position:0%
was passed by the house policy committee
 
00:20:39.190 --> 00:20:39.200 align:start position:0%
as well as the house finance i think to
 
00:20:41.029 --> 00:20:41.039 align:start position:0%
the point of representative turcotte
 
00:20:43.190 --> 00:20:43.200 align:start position:0%
that there are still some uh issues
 
00:20:45.350 --> 00:20:45.360 align:start position:0%
concerns around the floor amendment that
 
00:20:46.630 --> 00:20:46.640 align:start position:0%
was passed in the bill but i'll leave
 
00:20:49.590 --> 00:20:49.600 align:start position:0%
that to the conferees to discuss that
 
00:20:52.230 --> 00:20:52.240 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
00:20:54.710 --> 00:20:54.720 align:start position:0%
i don't think that answered my question
 
00:20:54.720 --> 00:20:56.549 align:start position:0%
i don't think that answered my question
if

00:20:56.549 --> 00:20:56.559 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:21:00.390 --> 00:21:00.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:02.789 --> 00:21:02.799 align:start position:0%
uh yes i do
 
00:21:05.190 --> 00:21:05.200 align:start position:0%
go for it yeah
 
00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:05.990 align:start position:0%
go for it yeah
so

00:21:05.990 --> 00:21:06.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:21:08.470 --> 00:21:08.480 align:start position:0%
the department thinks that
 
00:21:10.230 --> 00:21:10.240 align:start position:0%
a misdemeanor
 
00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:13.750 align:start position:0%
a misdemeanor
will

00:21:13.750 --> 00:21:13.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:15.669 --> 00:21:15.679 align:start position:0%
change people's
 
00:21:18.630 --> 00:21:18.640 align:start position:0%
attitude versus a violation is that
 
00:21:21.909 --> 00:21:21.919 align:start position:0%
is that what you're basically saying
 
00:21:23.909 --> 00:21:23.919 align:start position:0%
so uh for the record uh john williams
 
00:21:25.430 --> 00:21:25.440 align:start position:0%
the legislative director for health
 
00:21:28.710 --> 00:21:28.720 align:start position:0%
immune services and uh the mis the
 
00:21:30.390 --> 00:21:30.400 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor provisions have been in law
 
00:21:32.390 --> 00:21:32.400 align:start position:0%
for some period of time and seems to
 
00:21:34.870 --> 00:21:34.880 align:start position:0%
serve and seem to be serving very well
 
00:21:36.070 --> 00:21:36.080 align:start position:0%
in terms of protecting the
 
00:21:38.230 --> 00:21:38.240 align:start position:0%
confidentiality of those proceedings the
 
00:21:40.230 --> 00:21:40.240 align:start position:0%
concern is if you back off from a
 
00:21:42.310 --> 00:21:42.320 align:start position:0%
criminal level misdemeanor offense to a
 
00:21:44.230 --> 00:21:44.240 align:start position:0%
violation which is the equivalent could
 
00:21:46.870 --> 00:21:46.880 align:start position:0%
be of a parking violation that it would
 
00:21:48.950 --> 00:21:48.960 align:start position:0%
therefore erode the protections around
 
00:21:50.549 --> 00:21:50.559 align:start position:0%
the confidentiality for those
 
00:21:50.559 --> 00:21:55.110 align:start position:0%
the confidentiality for those
proceedings

00:21:55.110 --> 00:21:55.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:56.710 --> 00:21:56.720 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:21:59.350 --> 00:21:59.360 align:start position:0%
answer quencher question no but that's
 
00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:00.390 align:start position:0%
answer quencher question no but that's
okay

00:22:00.390 --> 00:22:00.400 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:03.110 align:start position:0%
okay
okay

00:22:03.110 --> 00:22:03.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:04.710 --> 00:22:04.720 align:start position:0%
represent bradley
 
00:22:07.270 --> 00:22:07.280 align:start position:0%
so is it safe to say
 
00:22:07.280 --> 00:22:09.029 align:start position:0%
so is it safe to say
on

00:22:09.029 --> 00:22:09.039 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:22:13.270 --> 00:22:13.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:16.789 --> 00:22:16.799 align:start position:0%
um dealing with senate bill 430 with the
 
00:22:18.710 --> 00:22:18.720 align:start position:0%
exception of
 
00:22:21.430 --> 00:22:21.440 align:start position:0%
section 62
 
00:22:24.149 --> 00:22:24.159 align:start position:0%
in the side by side we are at least
 
00:22:28.149 --> 00:22:28.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:28.159 --> 00:22:31.029 align:start position:0%
 
representative

00:22:31.029 --> 00:22:31.039 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:22:33.430 --> 00:22:33.440 align:start position:0%
i can't answer that completely but uh
 
00:22:36.950 --> 00:22:36.960 align:start position:0%
that is still leaving out section 64
 
00:22:36.960 --> 00:22:40.070 align:start position:0%
that is still leaving out section 64
of

00:22:40.070 --> 00:22:40.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:41.830 --> 00:22:41.840 align:start position:0%
of our fl
 
00:22:43.110 --> 00:22:43.120 align:start position:0%
which would have been our floor
 
00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:44.870 align:start position:0%
which would have been our floor
amendment

00:22:44.870 --> 00:22:44.880 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:22:48.070 --> 00:22:48.080 align:start position:0%
and section 64 was i think it was house
 
00:22:48.080 --> 00:22:48.870 align:start position:0%
and section 64 was i think it was house
bill

00:22:48.870 --> 00:22:48.880 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:50.630 align:start position:0%
bill
1044

00:22:50.630 --> 00:22:50.640 align:start position:0%
1044
 
00:22:53.510 --> 00:22:53.520 align:start position:0%
i don't recall off the top of my head
 
00:22:55.830 --> 00:22:55.840 align:start position:0%
senator but it's uh it's not like i say
 
00:22:58.710 --> 00:22:58.720 align:start position:0%
it's on page 18 there starting 64
 
00:23:00.789 --> 00:23:00.799 align:start position:0%
residential care and health facility
 
00:23:00.799 --> 00:23:02.390 align:start position:0%
residential care and health facility
licensing

00:23:02.390 --> 00:23:02.400 align:start position:0%
licensing
 
00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:03.350 align:start position:0%
licensing
and

00:23:03.350 --> 00:23:03.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:23:05.110 --> 00:23:05.120 align:start position:0%
talks about the
 
00:23:07.350 --> 00:23:07.360 align:start position:0%
facility operating as a membership based
 
00:23:07.360 --> 00:23:08.390 align:start position:0%
facility operating as a membership based
business

00:23:08.390 --> 00:23:08.400 align:start position:0%
business
 
00:23:10.789 --> 00:23:10.799 align:start position:0%
that's the paragraph excuse me
 
00:23:12.710 --> 00:23:12.720 align:start position:0%
and the senate
 
00:23:15.669 --> 00:23:15.679 align:start position:0%
um killed that bill so we would have an
 
00:23:17.430 --> 00:23:17.440 align:start position:0%
issue with that
 
00:23:22.789 --> 00:23:22.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:24.630 --> 00:23:24.640 align:start position:0%
further discussion from committee
 
00:23:24.640 --> 00:23:26.549 align:start position:0%
further discussion from committee
members

00:23:26.549 --> 00:23:26.559 align:start position:0%
members
 
00:23:29.190 --> 00:23:29.200 align:start position:0%
so it appears that we are not ready to
 
00:23:31.909 --> 00:23:31.919 align:start position:0%
resolve this issue right now the
 
00:23:33.750 --> 00:23:33.760 align:start position:0%
the house is looking at the position as
 
00:23:35.270 --> 00:23:35.280 align:start position:0%
stated within
 
00:23:35.280 --> 00:23:36.470 align:start position:0%
stated within
the

00:23:36.470 --> 00:23:36.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:23:40.230 --> 00:23:40.240 align:start position:0%
bill as amended by the house on page
 
00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:41.750 align:start position:0%
bill as amended by the house on page
18

00:23:41.750 --> 00:23:41.760 align:start position:0%
18
 
00:23:44.950 --> 00:23:44.960 align:start position:0%
and it appears that the senate's not
 
00:23:52.710 --> 00:23:52.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:55.750 --> 00:23:55.760 align:start position:0%
what about uh going back to the page on
 
00:23:58.070 --> 00:23:58.080 align:start position:0%
the side by side which is on page 24
 
00:23:59.750 --> 00:23:59.760 align:start position:0%
dealing with uh misdemeanor verse
 
00:24:02.830 --> 00:24:02.840 align:start position:0%
violation where do we stand on that
 
00:24:05.830 --> 00:24:05.840 align:start position:0%
issue i think we would prefer to stay
 
00:24:07.510 --> 00:24:07.520 align:start position:0%
with a current law
 
00:24:10.710 --> 00:24:10.720 align:start position:0%
which is a misdemeanor
 
00:24:12.190 --> 00:24:12.200 align:start position:0%
if there's a violation of
 
00:24:14.549 --> 00:24:14.559 align:start position:0%
confidentiality that there need to be
 
00:24:14.559 --> 00:24:15.430 align:start position:0%
confidentiality that there need to be
some

00:24:15.430 --> 00:24:15.440 align:start position:0%
some
 
00:24:15.440 --> 00:24:16.830 align:start position:0%
some
level

00:24:16.830 --> 00:24:16.840 align:start position:0%
level
 
00:24:23.190 --> 00:24:23.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:28.230 --> 00:24:28.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:33.909 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:24:33.909 --> 00:24:33.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:47.269 --> 00:24:47.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:48.710 --> 00:24:48.720 align:start position:0%
what i would say on that i think we're
 
00:24:50.870 --> 00:24:50.880 align:start position:0%
going to be probably
 
00:24:53.110 --> 00:24:53.120 align:start position:0%
recessing till a date in the future to
 
00:24:54.549 --> 00:24:54.559 align:start position:0%
go over some of these others maybe
 
00:24:56.310 --> 00:24:56.320 align:start position:0%
that's one
 
00:24:58.149 --> 00:24:58.159 align:start position:0%
if representative umberger still hasn't
 
00:25:01.510 --> 00:25:01.520 align:start position:0%
gotten a satisfactory answer on maybe
 
00:25:04.390 --> 00:25:04.400 align:start position:0%
we can discuss that one within committee
 
00:25:11.110 --> 00:25:11.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:12.149 --> 00:25:12.159 align:start position:0%
are there
 
00:25:14.630 --> 00:25:14.640 align:start position:0%
okay if is there any more discussion on
 
00:25:17.269 --> 00:25:17.279 align:start position:0%
this part of 1661
 
00:25:19.669 --> 00:25:19.679 align:start position:0%
may i ask one more question yes mr
 
00:25:19.679 --> 00:25:22.549 align:start position:0%
may i ask one more question yes mr
chairman

00:25:22.549 --> 00:25:22.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:25.269 --> 00:25:25.279 align:start position:0%
this is for uh hhs
 
00:25:26.870 --> 00:25:26.880 align:start position:0%
do you have any idea how many
 
00:25:26.880 --> 00:25:28.870 align:start position:0%
do you have any idea how many
misdemeanors

00:25:28.870 --> 00:25:28.880 align:start position:0%
misdemeanors
 
00:25:34.470 --> 00:25:34.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:37.909 --> 00:25:37.919 align:start position:0%
not protecting the uh confidentiality
 
00:25:39.750 --> 00:25:39.760 align:start position:0%
that that is very good question i'm i do
 
00:25:41.430 --> 00:25:41.440 align:start position:0%
not have an answer for it but i will
 
00:25:43.350 --> 00:25:43.360 align:start position:0%
endeavor to get you an answer
 
00:25:49.029 --> 00:25:49.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:49.039 --> 00:25:59.029 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:25:59.029 --> 00:25:59.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:01.669 --> 00:26:01.679 align:start position:0%
right um
 
00:26:03.269 --> 00:26:03.279 align:start position:0%
i guess we are
 
00:26:05.990 --> 00:26:06.000 align:start position:0%
jumping down to any other areas within
 
00:26:08.789 --> 00:26:08.799 align:start position:0%
that building next areas which
 
00:26:10.149 --> 00:26:10.159 align:start position:0%
i don't have that bill in front of me i
 
00:26:14.390 --> 00:26:14.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:18.230 --> 00:26:18.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:18.240 --> 00:26:19.350 align:start position:0%
 
yes

00:26:19.350 --> 00:26:19.360 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:26:20.870 --> 00:26:20.880 align:start position:0%
i'd just like to confirm with the senate
 
00:26:22.549 --> 00:26:22.559 align:start position:0%
just to make sure we are all on the same
 
00:26:26.710 --> 00:26:26.720 align:start position:0%
page that hp 1476 and sb 420 have their
 
00:26:28.549 --> 00:26:28.559 align:start position:0%
own separate con committees of
 
00:26:33.830 --> 00:26:33.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:37.430 --> 00:26:37.440 align:start position:0%
senate bill 6420 has its own separate
 
00:26:38.570 --> 00:26:38.580 align:start position:0%
committee of conference
 
00:26:38.580 --> 00:26:39.830 align:start position:0%
committee of conference
[Music]

00:26:39.830 --> 00:26:39.840 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:26:39.840 --> 00:26:41.590 align:start position:0%
[Music]
1476

00:26:41.590 --> 00:26:41.600 align:start position:0%
1476
 
00:26:44.470 --> 00:26:44.480 align:start position:0%
please remind me what that is
 
00:26:44.480 --> 00:26:45.350 align:start position:0%
please remind me what that is
yes

00:26:45.350 --> 00:26:45.360 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:26:46.950 --> 00:26:46.960 align:start position:0%
we'll get to bail in a minute i think
 
00:26:48.549 --> 00:26:48.559 align:start position:0%
right right
 
00:26:50.230 --> 00:26:50.240 align:start position:0%
but it has its own separate committee
 
00:26:51.830 --> 00:26:51.840 align:start position:0%
conference that's i just want to confirm
 
00:26:53.269 --> 00:26:53.279 align:start position:0%
that so that was not part of this
 
00:26:55.510 --> 00:26:55.520 align:start position:0%
conversation thank you
 
00:26:57.669 --> 00:26:57.679 align:start position:0%
let's have some conversation
 
00:26:59.909 --> 00:26:59.919 align:start position:0%
go ahead represent senator
 
00:27:03.110 --> 00:27:03.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:05.110 --> 00:27:05.120 align:start position:0%
i would just ask mr chair we will be
 
00:27:07.990 --> 00:27:08.000 align:start position:0%
discussing those because they're in here
 
00:27:10.310 --> 00:27:10.320 align:start position:0%
we will get to 420. yeah thank you
 
00:27:12.310 --> 00:27:12.320 align:start position:0%
that's where you want to go right
 
00:27:17.110 --> 00:27:17.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:18.310 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:27:18.310 --> 00:27:18.320 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:27:19.830 --> 00:27:19.840 align:start position:0%
senator turcotte just under senator
 
00:27:21.190 --> 00:27:21.200 align:start position:0%
representative turcotte just mentioned
 
00:27:23.350 --> 00:27:23.360 align:start position:0%
that we do have 420
 
00:27:25.510 --> 00:27:25.520 align:start position:0%
and that is a bill which deals with
 
00:27:27.510 --> 00:27:27.520 align:start position:0%
exactly what we have here
 
00:27:29.909 --> 00:27:29.919 align:start position:0%
the house is really of the opinion right
 
00:27:32.310 --> 00:27:32.320 align:start position:0%
now that we should not be addressing 420
 
00:27:34.950 --> 00:27:34.960 align:start position:0%
in 1661 but dealing with it in the
 
00:27:38.389 --> 00:27:38.399 align:start position:0%
community conference on 420.
 
00:27:41.990 --> 00:27:42.000 align:start position:0%
mr chairman just for senator hennessey's
 
00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:44.389 align:start position:0%
mr chairman just for senator hennessey's
clarity

00:27:44.389 --> 00:27:44.399 align:start position:0%
clarity
 
00:27:46.470 --> 00:27:46.480 align:start position:0%
sb 420
 
00:27:48.470 --> 00:27:48.480 align:start position:0%
has its own committee of conference
 
00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:49.590 align:start position:0%
has its own committee of conference
schedule

00:27:49.590 --> 00:27:49.600 align:start position:0%
schedule
 
00:27:51.669 --> 00:27:51.679 align:start position:0%
so we our position would be we don't
 
00:27:52.789 --> 00:27:52.799 align:start position:0%
want to make that part of this
 
00:27:56.710 --> 00:27:56.720 align:start position:0%
discussion and also hb 1476 has its own
 
00:27:59.190 --> 00:27:59.200 align:start position:0%
committee of conference so that
 
00:28:01.650 --> 00:28:01.660 align:start position:0%
even though the original
 
00:28:01.660 --> 00:28:02.870 align:start position:0%
even though the original
[Music]

00:28:02.870 --> 00:28:02.880 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:28:05.510 --> 00:28:05.520 align:start position:0%
your amendment including those since
 
00:28:06.789 --> 00:28:06.799 align:start position:0%
they have their own committees of
 
00:28:08.149 --> 00:28:08.159 align:start position:0%
conference they they aren't going to be
 
00:28:09.830 --> 00:28:09.840 align:start position:0%
a subject of
 
00:28:15.430 --> 00:28:15.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:18.870 --> 00:28:18.880 align:start position:0%
senator bradley so if i can jump in here
 
00:28:21.669 --> 00:28:21.679 align:start position:0%
um i had a conversation with the speaker
 
00:28:23.750 --> 00:28:23.760 align:start position:0%
a couple of days ago
 
00:28:26.630 --> 00:28:26.640 align:start position:0%
and indicated that i thought the
 
00:28:30.470 --> 00:28:30.480 align:start position:0%
best place to have a discussion about
 
00:28:33.110 --> 00:28:33.120 align:start position:0%
bail issues was in the committee of
 
00:28:34.669 --> 00:28:34.679 align:start position:0%
conference on
 
00:28:38.389 --> 00:28:38.399 align:start position:0%
1476 so i believe the senate could agree
 
00:28:42.070 --> 00:28:42.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:46.149 --> 00:28:46.159 align:start position:0%
basically take sections
 
00:28:47.750 --> 00:28:47.760 align:start position:0%
um well it's
 
00:28:50.630 --> 00:28:50.640 align:start position:0%
um the top of page 24 in the
 
00:28:53.590 --> 00:28:53.600 align:start position:0%
um senate fast version starts on section
 
00:28:53.600 --> 00:28:54.710 align:start position:0%
um senate fast version starts on section
80.

00:28:54.710 --> 00:28:54.720 align:start position:0%
80.
 
00:28:56.149 --> 00:28:56.159 align:start position:0%
out of
 
00:28:57.750 --> 00:28:57.760 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
00:29:00.230 --> 00:29:00.240 align:start position:0%
knowing that their the focus is going to
 
00:29:02.310 --> 00:29:02.320 align:start position:0%
be on the other committee of conference
 
00:29:02.320 --> 00:29:03.510 align:start position:0%
be on the other committee of conference
and

00:29:03.510 --> 00:29:03.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:29:04.950 --> 00:29:04.960 align:start position:0%
i think the senate would have cede to
 
00:29:04.960 --> 00:29:06.870 align:start position:0%
i think the senate would have cede to
that

00:29:06.870 --> 00:29:06.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:29:09.750 --> 00:29:09.760 align:start position:0%
off right off the bat so
 
00:29:13.430 --> 00:29:13.440 align:start position:0%
but i think in terms of senate bill 420
 
00:29:15.590 --> 00:29:15.600 align:start position:0%
we want to make sure that
 
00:29:18.070 --> 00:29:18.080 align:start position:0%
uh the underlying bill the
 
00:29:20.950 --> 00:29:20.960 align:start position:0%
extraordinary grants is
 
00:29:23.510 --> 00:29:23.520 align:start position:0%
whether it's in this bill or it's in
 
00:29:25.110 --> 00:29:25.120 align:start position:0%
senator hennessey's bill we want to make
 
00:29:27.350 --> 00:29:27.360 align:start position:0%
sure that that moves forward in a way
 
00:29:33.029 --> 00:29:33.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:35.350 --> 00:29:35.360 align:start position:0%
i think that in in terms of addressing
 
00:29:37.669 --> 00:29:37.679 align:start position:0%
for senate bill 420 through that
 
00:29:40.789 --> 00:29:40.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:42.470 --> 00:29:42.480 align:start position:0%
we are i don't want to get into the
 
00:29:44.070 --> 00:29:44.080 align:start position:0%
discussion on that bill right here now
 
00:29:46.070 --> 00:29:46.080 align:start position:0%
but we are supportive
 
00:29:47.990 --> 00:29:48.000 align:start position:0%
of the
 
00:29:50.149 --> 00:29:50.159 align:start position:0%
extraordinary needs grant
 
00:29:52.230 --> 00:29:52.240 align:start position:0%
but would prefer to discuss that and
 
00:29:55.830 --> 00:29:55.840 align:start position:0%
take action on that in sb 420 committee
 
00:29:57.110 --> 00:29:57.120 align:start position:0%
a conference
 
00:30:00.389 --> 00:30:00.399 align:start position:0%
we we see that there may be a need to
 
00:30:03.110 --> 00:30:03.120 align:start position:0%
make a minor adjustment to it
 
00:30:04.710 --> 00:30:04.720 align:start position:0%
uh we can address that in terms of
 
00:30:04.720 --> 00:30:06.149 align:start position:0%
uh we can address that in terms of
accountability

00:30:06.149 --> 00:30:06.159 align:start position:0%
accountability
 
00:30:07.750 --> 00:30:07.760 align:start position:0%
which i think i've also spoken to
 
00:30:10.549 --> 00:30:10.559 align:start position:0%
previously about senator hennessy
 
00:30:14.630 --> 00:30:14.640 align:start position:0%
that we had discussed way back in 2018
 
00:30:17.110 --> 00:30:17.120 align:start position:0%
we weren't on board then when we had the
 
00:30:19.430 --> 00:30:19.440 align:start position:0%
task force led by the representative to
 
00:30:23.590 --> 00:30:23.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:25.430 --> 00:30:25.440 align:start position:0%
and and i would just since we're
 
00:30:27.590 --> 00:30:27.600 align:start position:0%
discussing it um
 
00:30:29.990 --> 00:30:30.000 align:start position:0%
indicate that the problematic subject
 
00:30:31.789 --> 00:30:31.799 align:start position:0%
matter whether it's in
 
00:30:34.549 --> 00:30:34.559 align:start position:0%
1661 or 420
 
00:30:37.029 --> 00:30:37.039 align:start position:0%
is the education tax credit piece moving
 
00:30:39.269 --> 00:30:39.279 align:start position:0%
to 500 percent of the federal poverty
 
00:30:41.990 --> 00:30:42.000 align:start position:0%
levels so just so we're all clear
 
00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:43.110 align:start position:0%
levels so just so we're all clear
where

00:30:43.110 --> 00:30:43.120 align:start position:0%
where
 
00:30:43.120 --> 00:30:44.950 align:start position:0%
where
the

00:30:44.950 --> 00:30:44.960 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:30:46.950 --> 00:30:46.960 align:start position:0%
concern is
 
00:30:49.990 --> 00:30:50.000 align:start position:0%
i we've also discussed that too and i
 
00:30:52.310 --> 00:30:52.320 align:start position:0%
think the house is prepared to
 
00:30:54.950 --> 00:30:54.960 align:start position:0%
look at the education tax credit which
 
00:30:57.190 --> 00:30:57.200 align:start position:0%
is not part of the you know
 
00:30:58.549 --> 00:30:58.559 align:start position:0%
of the
 
00:31:00.630 --> 00:31:00.640 align:start position:0%
uh education freedom account it's not
 
00:31:02.310 --> 00:31:02.320 align:start position:0%
anything to do with that that where we
 
00:31:04.149 --> 00:31:04.159 align:start position:0%
would prefer to maybe look at that
 
00:31:09.430 --> 00:31:09.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:09.440 --> 00:31:10.470 align:start position:0%
 
then

00:31:10.470 --> 00:31:10.480 align:start position:0%
then
 
00:31:12.950 --> 00:31:12.960 align:start position:0%
my recommendation would be we just
 
00:31:15.430 --> 00:31:15.440 align:start position:0%
defer any further discussion on 420
 
00:31:16.549 --> 00:31:16.559 align:start position:0%
knowing that you're going to have a
 
00:31:19.990 --> 00:31:20.000 align:start position:0%
committee a conference and it seems like
 
00:31:23.590 --> 00:31:23.600 align:start position:0%
that's the right place just like 1476 is
 
00:31:26.310 --> 00:31:26.320 align:start position:0%
the right place for bail
 
00:31:28.470 --> 00:31:28.480 align:start position:0%
to have those discussions i think we
 
00:31:30.549 --> 00:31:30.559 align:start position:0%
probably can all agree on that
 
00:31:32.789 --> 00:31:32.799 align:start position:0%
i think we we agree on that correct
 
00:31:32.799 --> 00:31:33.750 align:start position:0%
i think we we agree on that correct
everybody

00:31:33.750 --> 00:31:33.760 align:start position:0%
everybody
 
00:31:37.269 --> 00:31:37.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:37.279 --> 00:31:38.310 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:31:38.310 --> 00:31:38.320 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:31:41.350 --> 00:31:41.360 align:start position:0%
so we're taking out of this
 
00:31:41.360 --> 00:31:42.710 align:start position:0%
so we're taking out of this
amendment

00:31:42.710 --> 00:31:42.720 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:31:42.720 --> 00:31:44.149 align:start position:0%
amendment
bail

00:31:44.149 --> 00:31:44.159 align:start position:0%
bail
 
00:31:44.159 --> 00:31:45.750 align:start position:0%
bail
and

00:31:45.750 --> 00:31:45.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:31:49.509 --> 00:31:49.519 align:start position:0%
those need uh exceptional need grants
 
00:31:52.310 --> 00:31:52.320 align:start position:0%
is that right assuming we can come to
 
00:31:55.029 --> 00:31:55.039 align:start position:0%
conclusion on
 
00:31:58.389 --> 00:31:58.399 align:start position:0%
the committee or conference in 420
 
00:32:00.310 --> 00:32:00.320 align:start position:0%
the fail situation is a little different
 
00:32:03.750 --> 00:32:03.760 align:start position:0%
i promised the speaker that we'd have an
 
00:32:06.590 --> 00:32:06.600 align:start position:0%
up or down committee a conference on
 
00:32:09.430 --> 00:32:09.440 align:start position:0%
1476 the bail committee conference so
 
00:32:11.590 --> 00:32:11.600 align:start position:0%
we're prepared to
 
00:32:17.509 --> 00:32:17.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:19.750 --> 00:32:19.760 align:start position:0%
an accurate summation of our of our
 
00:32:19.760 --> 00:32:22.549 align:start position:0%
an accurate summation of our of our
conversation

00:32:22.549 --> 00:32:22.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:25.669 --> 00:32:25.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:27.190 --> 00:32:27.200 align:start position:0%
we have a number of the conferees are
 
00:32:29.909 --> 00:32:29.919 align:start position:0%
going to be on 420 sitting at this table
 
00:32:31.430 --> 00:32:31.440 align:start position:0%
right now
 
00:32:33.750 --> 00:32:33.760 align:start position:0%
and i can see that for the conferees
 
00:32:35.509 --> 00:32:35.519 align:start position:0%
that are sitting from the house side we
 
00:32:37.990 --> 00:32:38.000 align:start position:0%
are prepared to move forward with
 
00:32:40.830 --> 00:32:40.840 align:start position:0%
sb 420 the education
 
00:32:44.870 --> 00:32:44.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:48.070 --> 00:32:48.080 align:start position:0%
with what we have is we do have a
 
00:32:48.080 --> 00:32:49.509 align:start position:0%
with what we have is we do have a
proposed

00:32:49.509 --> 00:32:49.519 align:start position:0%
proposed
 
00:32:52.070 --> 00:32:52.080 align:start position:0%
amendment that provides accountability
 
00:32:54.789 --> 00:32:54.799 align:start position:0%
you receive this as the school district
 
00:32:56.389 --> 00:32:56.399 align:start position:0%
inform the department
 
00:32:58.710 --> 00:32:58.720 align:start position:0%
what you're going to do with the money
 
00:33:00.070 --> 00:33:00.080 align:start position:0%
is this the
 
00:33:01.669 --> 00:33:01.679 align:start position:0%
that's right that's some burger
 
00:33:01.679 --> 00:33:04.070 align:start position:0%
that's right that's some burger
amendment

00:33:04.070 --> 00:33:04.080 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:33:06.310 --> 00:33:06.320 align:start position:0%
you passed out senator hennessy
 
00:33:07.590 --> 00:33:07.600 align:start position:0%
mr chair
 
00:33:07.600 --> 00:33:09.269 align:start position:0%
mr chair
yes

00:33:09.269 --> 00:33:09.279 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:33:11.350 --> 00:33:11.360 align:start position:0%
so the amendment that i passed out was
 
00:33:13.110 --> 00:33:13.120 align:start position:0%
the amendment that representative
 
00:33:15.909 --> 00:33:15.919 align:start position:0%
umberger had added on the house side
 
00:33:17.669 --> 00:33:17.679 align:start position:0%
it's a technical fix
 
00:33:21.509 --> 00:33:21.519 align:start position:0%
versus the accountability fix
 
00:33:27.350 --> 00:33:27.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:30.710 --> 00:33:30.720 align:start position:0%
when we added 420 but we should have
 
00:33:32.710 --> 00:33:32.720 align:start position:0%
the other piece
 
00:33:35.909 --> 00:33:35.919 align:start position:0%
of 420 the accountability piece that you
 
00:33:41.269 --> 00:33:41.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:43.269 --> 00:33:43.279 align:start position:0%
i i'm familiar with the
 
00:33:44.870 --> 00:33:44.880 align:start position:0%
this one right here the umberger
 
00:33:46.789 --> 00:33:46.799 align:start position:0%
amendment dealing with the definition of
 
00:33:49.430 --> 00:33:49.440 align:start position:0%
equalized valuation per pupil based upon
 
00:33:51.830 --> 00:33:51.840 align:start position:0%
the free and reduced
 
00:33:54.310 --> 00:33:54.320 align:start position:0%
we got that and we under we in fact i
 
00:33:56.549 --> 00:33:56.559 align:start position:0%
believe came out of initially from the
 
00:33:58.070 --> 00:33:58.080 align:start position:0%
policy side
 
00:33:59.830 --> 00:33:59.840 align:start position:0%
here in the house okay we're good with
 
00:34:01.110 --> 00:34:01.120 align:start position:0%
that okay
 
00:34:03.669 --> 00:34:03.679 align:start position:0%
that what i'm talking about is a another
 
00:34:06.549 --> 00:34:06.559 align:start position:0%
amendment which we have an ied
 
00:34:08.310 --> 00:34:08.320 align:start position:0%
i don't believe i have that because we
 
00:34:13.589 --> 00:34:13.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:15.750 --> 00:34:15.760 align:start position:0%
the the other piece i believe you're
 
00:34:18.950 --> 00:34:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:20.550 --> 00:34:20.560 align:start position:0%
when a school district receives the
 
00:34:22.470 --> 00:34:22.480 align:start position:0%
grant they have to
 
00:34:24.550 --> 00:34:24.560 align:start position:0%
show that um
 
00:34:26.069 --> 00:34:26.079 align:start position:0%
what they're going to use the grant for
 
00:34:28.230 --> 00:34:28.240 align:start position:0%
and that they've made improvements
 
00:34:28.240 --> 00:34:29.270 align:start position:0%
and that they've made improvements
senator

00:34:29.270 --> 00:34:29.280 align:start position:0%
senator
 
00:34:31.589 --> 00:34:31.599 align:start position:0%
would you like me to speak at that about
 
00:34:33.829 --> 00:34:33.839 align:start position:0%
that mr chairman
 
00:34:36.069 --> 00:34:36.079 align:start position:0%
i would once again ask that we hold any
 
00:34:38.470 --> 00:34:38.480 align:start position:0%
discussions on 420 until that committee
 
00:34:41.349 --> 00:34:41.359 align:start position:0%
of conference i've just passed out the
 
00:34:44.710 --> 00:34:44.720 align:start position:0%
language which has been we will be
 
00:34:47.430 --> 00:34:47.440 align:start position:0%
asking that to be part of 420
 
00:34:50.069 --> 00:34:50.079 align:start position:0%
to you uh it's uh
 
00:34:53.030 --> 00:34:53.040 align:start position:0%
on this amendment right here which is is
 
00:34:54.790 --> 00:34:54.800 align:start position:0%
just the language which we stripped out
 
00:34:57.510 --> 00:34:57.520 align:start position:0%
of what we already had the past as a
 
00:34:57.520 --> 00:34:59.109 align:start position:0%
of what we already had the past as a
house

00:34:59.109 --> 00:34:59.119 align:start position:0%
house
 
00:35:01.030 --> 00:35:01.040 align:start position:0%
um and somewhere along the way it got
 
00:35:04.550 --> 00:35:04.560 align:start position:0%
lost or didn't get pasted in or added on
 
00:35:07.430 --> 00:35:07.440 align:start position:0%
it's a part roman 2 going down there on
 
00:35:11.910 --> 00:35:11.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:13.829 --> 00:35:13.839 align:start position:0%
that was designed if we were going to
 
00:35:16.630 --> 00:35:16.640 align:start position:0%
add it in 1661 which we are not going to
 
00:35:16.640 --> 00:35:18.069 align:start position:0%
add it in 1661 which we are not going to
do

00:35:18.069 --> 00:35:18.079 align:start position:0%
do
 
00:35:21.270 --> 00:35:21.280 align:start position:0%
so it would just be from line 17 to 32
 
00:35:23.109 --> 00:35:23.119 align:start position:0%
on that that would be the accountability
 
00:35:23.119 --> 00:35:24.550 align:start position:0%
on that that would be the accountability
section

00:35:24.550 --> 00:35:24.560 align:start position:0%
section
 
00:35:27.030 --> 00:35:27.040 align:start position:0%
mr chairman yes um
 
00:35:28.870 --> 00:35:28.880 align:start position:0%
from what i heard earlier
 
00:35:31.109 --> 00:35:31.119 align:start position:0%
my understanding was that
 
00:35:34.069 --> 00:35:34.079 align:start position:0%
we were in agreement on 1476
 
00:35:35.670 --> 00:35:35.680 align:start position:0%
bail not being part of this but a
 
00:35:38.069 --> 00:35:38.079 align:start position:0%
separate committee of conference but any
 
00:35:41.270 --> 00:35:41.280 align:start position:0%
discussion of the um
 
00:35:44.710 --> 00:35:44.720 align:start position:0%
sb 420 section of 1661
 
00:35:47.270 --> 00:35:47.280 align:start position:0%
would be on hold and we would first
 
00:35:49.510 --> 00:35:49.520 align:start position:0%
address um the committee of conference
 
00:35:49.520 --> 00:35:50.230 align:start position:0%
address um the committee of conference
for

00:35:50.230 --> 00:35:50.240 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:35:51.910 --> 00:35:51.920 align:start position:0%
sb 420
 
00:35:55.670 --> 00:35:55.680 align:start position:0%
itself is is that that's correct okay i
 
00:35:58.150 --> 00:35:58.160 align:start position:0%
think we agree to that we that's been
 
00:35:59.670 --> 00:35:59.680 align:start position:0%
agreed upon okay
 
00:36:01.349 --> 00:36:01.359 align:start position:0%
we will be dealing with everything
 
00:36:02.790 --> 00:36:02.800 align:start position:0%
dealing with the extraordinary needs
 
00:36:05.430 --> 00:36:05.440 align:start position:0%
grant in the committee conference for
 
00:36:08.790 --> 00:36:08.800 align:start position:0%
420 this was just explaining so that the
 
00:36:11.670 --> 00:36:11.680 align:start position:0%
senators here would be aware that that's
 
00:36:13.270 --> 00:36:13.280 align:start position:0%
we're going so we can make a decision on
 
00:36:13.280 --> 00:36:14.870 align:start position:0%
we're going so we can make a decision on
1661

00:36:14.870 --> 00:36:14.880 align:start position:0%
1661
 
00:36:17.990 --> 00:36:18.000 align:start position:0%
as to where we're going to go on that
 
00:36:20.870 --> 00:36:20.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:23.670 --> 00:36:23.680 align:start position:0%

00:36:25.430 --> 00:36:25.440 align:start position:0%
senator bradley
 
00:36:27.670 --> 00:36:27.680 align:start position:0%
that they want according what i'm
 
00:36:29.910 --> 00:36:29.920 align:start position:0%
hearing from the senate side is that
 
00:36:32.310 --> 00:36:32.320 align:start position:0%

yeah i guess they match here
 
00:39:39.030 --> 00:39:39.040 align:start position:0%
um so
 
00:39:41.750 --> 00:39:41.760 align:start position:0%
going through the bill from start to
 
00:39:41.760 --> 00:39:44.069 align:start position:0%
going through the bill from start to
finish

00:39:44.069 --> 00:39:44.079 align:start position:0%
finish
 
00:39:46.390 --> 00:39:46.400 align:start position:0%
starting on section 81
 
00:39:48.630 --> 00:39:48.640 align:start position:0%
where it talks about the training
 
00:39:49.670 --> 00:39:49.680 align:start position:0%
we are
 
00:39:51.430 --> 00:39:51.440 align:start position:0%
good with that
 
00:39:54.550 --> 00:39:54.560 align:start position:0%
section 82
 
00:39:57.349 --> 00:39:57.359 align:start position:0%
which talks about the local use board
 
00:39:59.030 --> 00:39:59.040 align:start position:0%
staff finance
 
00:40:01.510 --> 00:40:01.520 align:start position:0%
it's another section that we
 
00:40:04.470 --> 00:40:04.480 align:start position:0%
are okay with
 
00:40:07.030 --> 00:40:07.040 align:start position:0%
um except for
 
00:40:10.150 --> 00:40:10.160 align:start position:0%
section four
 
00:40:13.510 --> 00:40:13.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:16.069 --> 00:40:16.079 align:start position:0%
beginning with if a municipality allows
 
00:40:17.910 --> 00:40:17.920 align:start position:0%
that we
 
00:40:20.630 --> 00:40:20.640 align:start position:0%
we would like to see out
 
00:40:28.870 --> 00:40:28.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:32.870 --> 00:40:32.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:35.510 --> 00:40:35.520 align:start position:0%
we are okay with it we'd like to hear
 
00:40:37.109 --> 00:40:37.119 align:start position:0%
the senate's
 
00:40:39.829 --> 00:40:39.839 align:start position:0%
take on the 90 days
 
00:40:41.990 --> 00:40:42.000 align:start position:0%
whether that's adequate too much too
 
00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:44.069 align:start position:0%
whether that's adequate too much too
little

00:40:44.069 --> 00:40:44.079 align:start position:0%
little
 
00:40:46.390 --> 00:40:46.400 align:start position:0%
going down you're in section 85 now
 
00:40:49.030 --> 00:40:49.040 align:start position:0%
correct i was yes okay
 
00:40:51.349 --> 00:40:51.359 align:start position:0%
is there any reaction to the from the
 
00:40:56.470 --> 00:40:56.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:59.510 --> 00:40:59.520 align:start position:0%
you said you're in section 85 page 30
 
00:41:00.630 --> 00:41:00.640 align:start position:0%
that's correct
 
00:41:06.550 --> 00:41:06.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:09.030 --> 00:41:09.040 align:start position:0%
i heard you say you're okay with that 84
 
00:41:09.040 --> 00:41:25.190 align:start position:0%
i heard you say you're okay with that 84
yes

00:41:25.190 --> 00:41:25.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:26.550 --> 00:41:26.560 align:start position:0%
so anyway you can think about that one
 
00:41:28.309 --> 00:41:28.319 align:start position:0%
i'm going to continue real quick here
 
00:41:30.069 --> 00:41:30.079 align:start position:0%
okay you can go back to that 90 day
 
00:41:30.079 --> 00:41:30.950 align:start position:0%
okay you can go back to that 90 day
question

00:41:30.950 --> 00:41:30.960 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:41:30.960 --> 00:41:32.829 align:start position:0%
question
86

00:41:32.829 --> 00:41:32.839 align:start position:0%
86
 
00:41:32.839 --> 00:41:34.710 align:start position:0%
86
uh

00:41:34.710 --> 00:41:34.720 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:41:37.750 --> 00:41:37.760 align:start position:0%
there's a single change in that uh
 
00:41:40.630 --> 00:41:40.640 align:start position:0%
talking about subject to age restriction
 
00:41:47.750 --> 00:41:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:47.760 --> 00:41:49.750 align:start position:0%
 
87

00:41:49.750 --> 00:41:49.760 align:start position:0%
87
 
00:41:55.829 --> 00:41:55.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:02.230 --> 00:42:02.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:05.750 --> 00:42:05.760 align:start position:0%
section 88
 
00:42:10.309 --> 00:42:10.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:15.430 --> 00:42:15.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:15.440 --> 00:42:19.750 align:start position:0%
 
90

00:42:19.750 --> 00:42:19.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:21.349 --> 00:42:21.359 align:start position:0%
we are not
 
00:42:21.359 --> 00:42:22.470 align:start position:0%
we are not
uh

00:42:22.470 --> 00:42:22.480 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:42:24.309 --> 00:42:24.319 align:start position:0%
we would like to see out only because
 
00:42:26.230 --> 00:42:26.240 align:start position:0%
what there is a uh
 
00:42:29.589 --> 00:42:29.599 align:start position:0%
a bill in interim study that we believe
 
00:42:32.150 --> 00:42:32.160 align:start position:0%
is a better place
 
00:42:34.870 --> 00:42:34.880 align:start position:0%
to work that section of it i don't have
 
00:42:37.030 --> 00:42:37.040 align:start position:0%
the uh the bill number on that interim
 
00:42:39.109 --> 00:42:39.119 align:start position:0%
study but there is one that exists you
 
00:42:45.430 --> 00:42:45.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:49.109 --> 00:42:49.119 align:start position:0%
going over to the next section 91
 
00:42:51.030 --> 00:42:51.040 align:start position:0%
well what about 90. did i miss one you
 
00:42:52.430 --> 00:42:52.440 align:start position:0%
jumped over 90
 
00:42:52.440 --> 00:42:54.230 align:start position:0%
jumped over 90
90.

00:42:54.230 --> 00:42:54.240 align:start position:0%
90.
 
00:43:02.790 --> 00:43:02.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:04.790 --> 00:43:04.800 align:start position:0%
yeah i that uh
 
00:43:09.670 --> 00:43:09.680 align:start position:0%
89 and 90 are both contained in that uh
 
00:43:11.829 --> 00:43:11.839 align:start position:0%
the interim study bill so that would
 
00:43:13.670 --> 00:43:13.680 align:start position:0%
also be a no
 
00:43:15.190 --> 00:43:15.200 align:start position:0%
do you have the you said you didn't have
 
00:43:17.349 --> 00:43:17.359 align:start position:0%
the interim study i don't i can get it
 
00:43:19.430 --> 00:43:19.440 align:start position:0%
for you okay
 
00:43:23.349 --> 00:43:23.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:27.270 --> 00:43:27.280 align:start position:0%
uh section 91
 
00:43:28.870 --> 00:43:28.880 align:start position:0%
we are okay with
 
00:43:28.880 --> 00:43:31.829 align:start position:0%
we are okay with
okay

00:43:31.829 --> 00:43:31.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:31.839 --> 00:43:34.710 align:start position:0%
 
and

00:43:34.710 --> 00:43:34.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:34.720 --> 00:43:37.030 align:start position:0%
 
92

00:43:37.030 --> 00:43:37.040 align:start position:0%
92
 
00:43:37.040 --> 00:43:41.589 align:start position:0%
92
93

00:43:41.589 --> 00:43:41.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:46.790 --> 00:43:46.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:50.069 --> 00:43:50.079 align:start position:0%
dessert and 94 is also known within 92
 
00:43:54.230 --> 00:43:54.240 align:start position:0%
and 93 other specifics that or it's just
 
00:43:57.589 --> 00:43:57.599 align:start position:0%
the sections okay go ahead 92 93 and 94
 
00:44:00.630 --> 00:44:00.640 align:start position:0%
and then that gets us to the end
 
00:44:00.640 --> 00:44:06.390 align:start position:0%
and then that gets us to the end
okay

00:44:06.390 --> 00:44:06.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:06.400 --> 00:44:09.990 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:44:09.990 --> 00:44:10.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:11.349 --> 00:44:11.359 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
00:44:12.390 --> 00:44:12.400 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:44:16.309 --> 00:44:16.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:18.550 --> 00:44:18.560 align:start position:0%
would the senate like to discuss any of
 
00:44:21.109 --> 00:44:21.119 align:start position:0%
those areas that we have just walked
 
00:44:25.910 --> 00:44:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:25.920 --> 00:44:30.870 align:start position:0%
 
difference

00:44:30.870 --> 00:44:30.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:32.790 --> 00:44:32.800 align:start position:0%
or do you need time
 
00:44:32.800 --> 00:44:36.309 align:start position:0%
or do you need time
um

00:44:36.309 --> 00:44:36.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:38.309 --> 00:44:38.319 align:start position:0%
all right so why don't we start at the
 
00:44:40.150 --> 00:44:40.160 align:start position:0%
top which would be
 
00:44:42.710 --> 00:44:42.720 align:start position:0%
section 85
 
00:44:42.720 --> 00:44:43.670 align:start position:0%
section 85
um

00:44:43.670 --> 00:44:43.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:47.910 --> 00:44:47.920 align:start position:0%
is there an alternative proposal to 90
 
00:44:47.920 --> 00:44:56.069 align:start position:0%
is there an alternative proposal to 90
days

00:44:56.069 --> 00:44:56.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:57.829 --> 00:44:57.839 align:start position:0%
not looking so much for a proposal we
 
00:44:59.270 --> 00:44:59.280 align:start position:0%
were just trying to get your
 
00:45:01.670 --> 00:45:01.680 align:start position:0%
understanding of why 90 what rather than
 
00:45:03.589 --> 00:45:03.599 align:start position:0%
60 or 120 just
 
00:45:05.349 --> 00:45:05.359 align:start position:0%
an explanation i don't think we're
 
00:45:05.359 --> 00:45:07.670 align:start position:0%
an explanation i don't think we're
really

00:45:07.670 --> 00:45:07.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:09.990 --> 00:45:10.000 align:start position:0%
hung up on it i think the proponents of
 
00:45:11.990 --> 00:45:12.000 align:start position:0%
the bill felt that it was workable
 
00:45:16.309 --> 00:45:16.319 align:start position:0%
within a 90-day time frame to
 
00:45:18.870 --> 00:45:18.880 align:start position:0%
begin formal consideration and approve
 
00:45:22.150 --> 00:45:22.160 align:start position:0%
or disapprove i mean obviously the
 
00:45:24.309 --> 00:45:24.319 align:start position:0%
point is to try to move through the
 
00:45:28.710 --> 00:45:28.720 align:start position:0%
process for workforce housing so
 
00:45:30.309 --> 00:45:30.319 align:start position:0%
90 days was
 
00:45:34.150 --> 00:45:34.160 align:start position:0%
the way um it was proposed to us by the
 
00:45:41.510 --> 00:45:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:44.630 --> 00:45:44.640 align:start position:0%
i don't think we'd be be opposed to that
 
00:45:44.640 --> 00:45:47.030 align:start position:0%
i don't think we'd be be opposed to that
right

00:45:47.030 --> 00:45:47.040 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:45:49.910 --> 00:45:49.920 align:start position:0%
so the next section
 
00:45:53.109 --> 00:45:53.119 align:start position:0%
uh the workforce housing definition hang
 
00:45:55.430 --> 00:45:55.440 align:start position:0%
on let me
 
00:46:00.550 --> 00:46:00.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:00.560 --> 00:46:35.109 align:start position:0%
 
here

00:46:35.109 --> 00:46:35.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:36.550 --> 00:46:36.560 align:start position:0%
uh representative
 
00:46:40.829 --> 00:46:40.839 align:start position:0%
can i just ask a question on the side by
 
00:46:42.710 --> 00:46:42.720 align:start position:0%
side um
 
00:46:45.589 --> 00:46:45.599 align:start position:0%
where is the section
 
00:46:48.710 --> 00:46:48.720 align:start position:0%
maybe i'm missing something that
 
00:46:48.720 --> 00:46:50.870 align:start position:0%
maybe i'm missing something that
um

00:46:50.870 --> 00:46:50.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:50.880 --> 00:46:52.150 align:start position:0%
um
equates

00:46:52.150 --> 00:46:52.160 align:start position:0%
equates
 
00:46:55.030 --> 00:46:55.040 align:start position:0%
uh workforce housing to
 
00:46:59.109 --> 00:46:59.119 align:start position:0%
incentives for elderly housing
 
00:47:01.990 --> 00:47:02.000 align:start position:0%
i in the senate version of the bill it's
 
00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:04.950 align:start position:0%
i in the senate version of the bill it's
section

00:47:04.950 --> 00:47:04.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:17.349 --> 00:47:17.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:22.230 --> 00:47:22.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:24.549 --> 00:47:24.559 align:start position:0%
yes i have it in
 
00:47:24.559 --> 00:47:26.710 align:start position:0%
yes i have it in
okay

00:47:26.710 --> 00:47:26.720 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:47:26.720 --> 00:47:27.990 align:start position:0%
okay
so

00:47:27.990 --> 00:47:28.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:47:33.030 --> 00:47:33.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:35.190 --> 00:47:35.200 align:start position:0%
uh representative turcotte
 
00:47:38.630 --> 00:47:38.640 align:start position:0%
you want that deleted
 
00:47:40.549 --> 00:47:40.559 align:start position:0%
because i think from our point of view
 
00:47:41.510 --> 00:47:41.520 align:start position:0%
this is
 
00:47:44.630 --> 00:47:44.640 align:start position:0%
one of the most important pieces of
 
00:47:50.230 --> 00:47:50.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:53.190 --> 00:47:53.200 align:start position:0%
yeah i i believe uh under that paragraph
 
00:47:55.430 --> 00:47:55.440 align:start position:0%
senator that um
 
00:47:57.829 --> 00:47:57.839 align:start position:0%
the definition is amended
 
00:48:00.630 --> 00:48:00.640 align:start position:0%
not that whole section removed
 
00:48:02.309 --> 00:48:02.319 align:start position:0%
and it's
 
00:48:05.589 --> 00:48:05.599 align:start position:0%
uh it was only to the
 
00:48:08.069 --> 00:48:08.079 align:start position:0%
subject to age restriction that that we
 
00:48:11.109 --> 00:48:11.119 align:start position:0%
had the issue with uh with
 
00:48:11.119 --> 00:48:15.510 align:start position:0%
had the issue with uh with
and

00:48:15.510 --> 00:48:15.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:32.870 --> 00:48:32.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:34.870 --> 00:48:34.880 align:start position:0%
i will is is that the part you were
 
00:48:36.710 --> 00:48:36.720 align:start position:0%
asked about this the age restriction
 
00:48:36.720 --> 00:48:38.549 align:start position:0%
asked about this the age restriction
itself

00:48:38.549 --> 00:48:38.559 align:start position:0%
itself
 
00:48:41.030 --> 00:48:41.040 align:start position:0%
if so i'm gonna have to get back to you
 
00:48:43.430 --> 00:48:43.440 align:start position:0%
when we reconvene to give you the exact
 
00:48:45.589 --> 00:48:45.599 align:start position:0%
response as to why i think it was
 
00:48:45.599 --> 00:48:54.790 align:start position:0%
response as to why i think it was
section

00:48:54.790 --> 00:48:54.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:58.790 --> 00:48:58.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:11.270 --> 00:49:11.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:13.190 --> 00:49:13.200 align:start position:0%
and that's what you want out and that's
 
00:49:21.030 --> 00:49:21.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:32.870 --> 00:49:32.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:35.190 --> 00:49:35.200 align:start position:0%
representative you thinking that that we
 
00:49:36.790 --> 00:49:36.800 align:start position:0%
need to get back on that
 
00:49:38.069 --> 00:49:38.079 align:start position:0%
yeah that's what i said before yeah i'm
 
00:49:39.109 --> 00:49:39.119 align:start position:0%
going to have to get back to you on that
 
00:49:43.990 --> 00:49:44.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:46.630 --> 00:49:46.640 align:start position:0%
senator d'alessandro did you have
 
00:49:49.990 --> 00:49:50.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:18.150 --> 00:50:18.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:18.160 --> 00:50:19.750 align:start position:0%
 
age

00:50:19.750 --> 00:50:19.760 align:start position:0%
age
 
00:50:21.510 --> 00:50:21.520 align:start position:0%
page 42
 
00:50:23.829 --> 00:50:23.839 align:start position:0%
is the next one that's where i am yeah
 
00:50:26.230 --> 00:50:26.240 align:start position:0%
so we're at right now the top page 42
 
00:50:28.309 --> 00:50:28.319 align:start position:0%
and the side by side here
 
00:50:28.319 --> 00:50:31.349 align:start position:0%
and the side by side here
um

00:50:31.349 --> 00:50:31.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:33.670 --> 00:50:33.680 align:start position:0%
we're that's being done by interim study
 
00:50:35.990 --> 00:50:36.000 align:start position:0%
now you said representative
 
00:50:38.230 --> 00:50:38.240 align:start position:0%
yes uh representative cordelli found the
 
00:50:39.950 --> 00:50:39.960 align:start position:0%
bill that's actually hb
 
00:50:43.510 --> 00:50:43.520 align:start position:0%
1389 and it was a bill entitled superior
 
00:50:45.510 --> 00:50:45.520 align:start position:0%
court land review
 
00:50:47.829 --> 00:50:47.839 align:start position:0%
and that entire section
 
00:50:49.750 --> 00:50:49.760 align:start position:0%
according to house majority leader
 
00:50:51.349 --> 00:50:51.359 align:start position:0%
osborne is
 
00:50:54.470 --> 00:50:54.480 align:start position:0%
who's also a co-sponsor of 1389
 
00:50:56.630 --> 00:50:56.640 align:start position:0%
we believe that is better handled in in
 
00:50:58.790 --> 00:50:58.800 align:start position:0%
that bill
 
00:51:08.309 --> 00:51:08.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:11.750 --> 00:51:11.760 align:start position:0%
and that's applicable to part 92
 
00:51:15.109 --> 00:51:15.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:17.030 --> 00:51:17.040 align:start position:0%
so uh if i could ask your question
 
00:51:19.430 --> 00:51:19.440 align:start position:0%
representative turcotte i think you said
 
00:51:21.349 --> 00:51:21.359 align:start position:0%
you're okay with
 
00:51:29.349 --> 00:51:29.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:32.230 --> 00:51:32.240 align:start position:0%
and you're okay i believe with section
 
00:51:43.990 --> 00:51:44.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:47.109 --> 00:51:47.119 align:start position:0%
all right and then we get to section 89
 
00:51:47.119 --> 00:51:47.910 align:start position:0%
all right and then we get to section 89
which

00:51:47.910 --> 00:51:47.920 align:start position:0%
which
 
00:51:50.630 --> 00:51:50.640 align:start position:0%
i think is pretty important section
 
00:51:52.950 --> 00:51:52.960 align:start position:0%
for expedited review in the courts i
 
00:51:55.430 --> 00:51:55.440 align:start position:0%
mean obviously
 
00:51:55.440 --> 00:51:56.549 align:start position:0%
mean obviously
um

00:51:56.549 --> 00:51:56.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:51:59.990 --> 00:52:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:02.470 --> 00:52:02.480 align:start position:0%
done and accomplished
 
00:52:04.309 --> 00:52:04.319 align:start position:0%
is there
 
00:52:04.319 --> 00:52:08.870 align:start position:0%
is there
um

00:52:08.870 --> 00:52:08.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:10.870 --> 00:52:10.880 align:start position:0%
maybe some common ground that we could
 
00:52:12.230 --> 00:52:12.240 align:start position:0%
get to with
 
00:52:15.910 --> 00:52:15.920 align:start position:0%
slightly longer timeline on this
 
00:52:18.790 --> 00:52:18.800 align:start position:0%
again senator that that section there is
 
00:52:18.800 --> 00:52:20.069 align:start position:0%
again senator that that section there is
uh

00:52:20.069 --> 00:52:20.079 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:52:22.230 --> 00:52:22.240 align:start position:0%
the section i referred to in uh house
 
00:52:24.710 --> 00:52:24.720 align:start position:0%
bill 1389
 
00:52:24.720 --> 00:52:25.750 align:start position:0%
bill 1389
um

00:52:25.750 --> 00:52:25.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:28.470 --> 00:52:28.480 align:start position:0%
and representative osborne does believe
 
00:52:28.480 --> 00:52:29.270 align:start position:0%
and representative osborne does believe
that

00:52:29.270 --> 00:52:29.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:52:31.510 --> 00:52:31.520 align:start position:0%
we could handle that section 18 section
 
00:52:33.990 --> 00:52:34.000 align:start position:0%
89 and 90 better
 
00:52:39.270 --> 00:52:39.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:41.589 --> 00:52:41.599 align:start position:0%
so you're seeing the next biennium
 
00:52:41.599 --> 00:52:49.270 align:start position:0%
so you're seeing the next biennium
exactly

00:52:49.270 --> 00:52:49.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:49.280 --> 00:53:04.630 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:53:04.630 --> 00:53:04.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:07.270 --> 00:53:07.280 align:start position:0%
again i guess i'd ask the same question
 
00:53:21.910 --> 00:53:21.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:22.950 --> 00:53:22.960 align:start position:0%
i think
 
00:53:23.829 --> 00:53:23.839 align:start position:0%
if i
 
00:53:25.910 --> 00:53:25.920 align:start position:0%
wrote it down correctly that that was a
 
00:53:25.920 --> 00:53:27.109 align:start position:0%
wrote it down correctly that that was a
section

00:53:27.109 --> 00:53:27.119 align:start position:0%
section
 
00:53:30.069 --> 00:53:30.079 align:start position:0%
you're proposed to striking
 
00:53:34.950 --> 00:53:34.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:44.710 --> 00:53:44.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:44.720 --> 00:53:45.750 align:start position:0%
 
yes

00:53:45.750 --> 00:53:45.760 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:53:45.760 --> 00:53:46.790 align:start position:0%
yes
92

00:53:46.790 --> 00:53:46.800 align:start position:0%
92
 
00:54:06.069 --> 00:54:06.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:19.670 --> 00:54:19.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:21.030 --> 00:54:21.040 align:start position:0%
anything else
 
00:54:23.190 --> 00:54:23.200 align:start position:0%
i would just say i think going back it
 
00:54:26.150 --> 00:54:26.160 align:start position:0%
was section 83
 
00:54:28.309 --> 00:54:28.319 align:start position:0%
um obviously you're going to get back to
 
00:54:31.589 --> 00:54:31.599 align:start position:0%
us but i would just highlight that that
 
00:54:34.150 --> 00:54:34.160 align:start position:0%
the workforce housing and the elderly
 
00:54:36.309 --> 00:54:36.319 align:start position:0%
housing that is
 
00:54:40.950 --> 00:54:40.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:43.910 --> 00:54:43.920 align:start position:0%
myself and i think all the senators too
 
00:54:43.920 --> 00:54:45.829 align:start position:0%
myself and i think all the senators too
um

00:54:45.829 --> 00:54:45.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:54:48.069 --> 00:54:48.079 align:start position:0%
so hopefully we can find a way maybe
 
00:54:49.910 --> 00:54:49.920 align:start position:0%
some of these other sections are of
 
00:54:52.309 --> 00:54:52.319 align:start position:0%
lesser importance but that one is very
 
00:54:58.549 --> 00:54:58.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:00.230 --> 00:55:00.240 align:start position:0%
83 was that
 
00:55:02.150 --> 00:55:02.160 align:start position:0%
yeah senator
 
00:55:04.230 --> 00:55:04.240 align:start position:0%
we're talking section 83 right now it's
 
00:55:16.309 --> 00:55:16.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:17.990 --> 00:55:18.000 align:start position:0%
are there further comments on this
 
00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:22.230 align:start position:0%
are there further comments on this
representative

00:55:22.230 --> 00:55:22.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:27.750 --> 00:55:27.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:31.349 --> 00:55:31.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:34.710 --> 00:55:34.720 align:start position:0%
it seems to me we should you know think
 
00:55:38.150 --> 00:55:38.160 align:start position:0%
about this over over the weekend and
 
00:55:39.750 --> 00:55:39.760 align:start position:0%
talk amongst
 
00:55:39.760 --> 00:55:43.829 align:start position:0%
talk amongst
ourselves

00:55:43.829 --> 00:55:43.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:45.750 --> 00:55:45.760 align:start position:0%
and i would concur with the senator and
 
00:55:49.910 --> 00:55:49.920 align:start position:0%
i would i would also add um
 
00:55:52.150 --> 00:55:52.160 align:start position:0%
and i can't remember the sections in the
 
00:55:54.630 --> 00:55:54.640 align:start position:0%
original bill i think it was section 4
 
00:55:58.549 --> 00:55:58.559 align:start position:0%
and 16 of senate bill 400
 
00:56:01.910 --> 00:56:01.920 align:start position:0%
um that dealt with inclusionary zoning
 
00:56:03.990 --> 00:56:04.000 align:start position:0%
and the champion award
 
00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:05.349 align:start position:0%
and the champion award
um

00:56:05.349 --> 00:56:05.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:56:07.910 --> 00:56:07.920 align:start position:0%
understanding i think we had heard
 
00:56:10.309 --> 00:56:10.319 align:start position:0%
that there was opposition on your side
 
00:56:11.510 --> 00:56:11.520 align:start position:0%
to that
 
00:56:14.230 --> 00:56:14.240 align:start position:0%
and there was some opposition from
 
00:56:16.470 --> 00:56:16.480 align:start position:0%
the municipal association
 
00:56:18.470 --> 00:56:18.480 align:start position:0%
to those two sections senate dropped
 
00:56:19.829 --> 00:56:19.839 align:start position:0%
those already
 
00:56:22.150 --> 00:56:22.160 align:start position:0%
so they're not in
 
00:56:24.390 --> 00:56:24.400 align:start position:0%
the senate version of
 
00:56:35.349 --> 00:56:35.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:40.309 --> 00:56:40.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:42.309 --> 00:56:42.319 align:start position:0%
on this right now what we need to do is
 
00:56:43.670 --> 00:56:43.680 align:start position:0%
identify the time which we're going to
 
00:56:45.670 --> 00:56:45.680 align:start position:0%
come back together and meet
 
00:56:51.829 --> 00:56:51.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:54.230 --> 00:56:54.240 align:start position:0%
thank you go ahead represent ambergris
 
00:56:58.069 --> 00:56:58.079 align:start position:0%
yeah the only question that i have is on
 
00:56:58.079 --> 00:56:59.990 align:start position:0%
yeah the only question that i have is on
um

00:56:59.990 --> 00:57:00.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:57:03.829 --> 00:57:03.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:03.839 --> 00:57:05.430 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:57:05.430 --> 00:57:05.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:57:07.990 --> 00:57:08.000 align:start position:0%
they had said that they wanted to go
 
00:57:10.630 --> 00:57:10.640 align:start position:0%
back to misdemeanor
 
00:57:10.640 --> 00:57:11.510 align:start position:0%
back to misdemeanor
um

00:57:11.510 --> 00:57:11.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:57:11.520 --> 00:57:12.390 align:start position:0%
um
and

00:57:12.390 --> 00:57:12.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:57:15.109 --> 00:57:15.119 align:start position:0%
i was just asking why i don't have any
 
00:57:17.430 --> 00:57:17.440 align:start position:0%
problem with that change
 
00:57:19.510 --> 00:57:19.520 align:start position:0%
i don't know if
 
00:57:28.230 --> 00:57:28.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:28.240 --> 00:57:29.910 align:start position:0%
 
oh

00:57:29.910 --> 00:57:29.920 align:start position:0%

00:57:32.950 --> 00:57:32.960 align:start position:0%
i just said the the the uh
 
00:57:37.430 --> 00:57:37.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:39.750 --> 00:57:39.760 align:start position:0%
that i had i had no problem with that i
 
00:57:40.870 --> 00:57:40.880 align:start position:0%

misdemeanor
 
00:57:48.069 --> 00:57:48.079 align:start position:0%
issues that had been
 
00:57:48.079 --> 00:57:51.349 align:start position:0%
issues that had been
found

00:57:51.349 --> 00:57:51.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:53.349 --> 00:57:53.359 align:start position:0%
well that was true
 
00:57:57.750 --> 00:57:57.760 align:start position:0%
okay i think mr williams may have more
 
00:58:01.349 --> 00:58:01.359 align:start position:0%
you're you're welcome to come up again
 
00:58:03.510 --> 00:58:03.520 align:start position:0%
we never see you in education but i see
 
00:58:06.069 --> 00:58:06.079 align:start position:0%
in the hallways
 
00:58:08.710 --> 00:58:08.720 align:start position:0%
thank you very much um so with some some
 
00:58:11.030 --> 00:58:11.040 align:start position:0%
assistance uh because it also involves
 
00:58:13.190 --> 00:58:13.200 align:start position:0%
us looking uh at
 
00:58:15.670 --> 00:58:15.680 align:start position:0%
it also involves us looking uh working
 
00:58:17.750 --> 00:58:17.760 align:start position:0%
with uh collaboratively with others uh
 
00:58:19.349 --> 00:58:19.359 align:start position:0%
the information i've been provided is
 
00:58:21.670 --> 00:58:21.680 align:start position:0%
that they're uh within approximately the
 
00:58:25.109 --> 00:58:25.119 align:start position:0%
last decade there were two incidents
 
00:58:26.950 --> 00:58:26.960 align:start position:0%
where there was at least primarily a
 
00:58:29.349 --> 00:58:29.359 align:start position:0%
charge arising from that statute it was
 
00:58:31.829 --> 00:58:31.839 align:start position:0%
converted to another charge eventually
 
00:58:34.470 --> 00:58:34.480 align:start position:0%
uh but both of the two uh charges that
 
00:58:36.549 --> 00:58:36.559 align:start position:0%
were brought forward under it uh
 
00:58:39.670 --> 00:58:39.680 align:start position:0%
died a uh um in the process they were
 
00:58:41.990 --> 00:58:42.000 align:start position:0%
either uh no proster they did not make
 
00:58:44.390 --> 00:58:44.400 align:start position:0%
their way to an actual conviction so uh
 
00:58:46.950 --> 00:58:46.960 align:start position:0%
the numbers were two charges apparently
 
00:58:49.349 --> 00:58:49.359 align:start position:0%
and then um none of them resulted in
 
00:58:49.359 --> 00:58:55.589 align:start position:0%
and then um none of them resulted in
conviction

00:58:55.589 --> 00:58:55.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:57.349 --> 00:58:57.359 align:start position:0%
which which may speak volumes of the
 
00:58:59.030 --> 00:58:59.040 align:start position:0%
fact because it is a criminal offense
 
00:59:00.710 --> 00:59:00.720 align:start position:0%
and it shows the importance of
 
00:59:02.549 --> 00:59:02.559 align:start position:0%
confidentiality relative to child
 
00:59:02.559 --> 00:59:03.750 align:start position:0%
confidentiality relative to child
protection

00:59:03.750 --> 00:59:03.760 align:start position:0%
protection
 
00:59:05.750 --> 00:59:05.760 align:start position:0%
cases if you are to reduce it to a
 
00:59:07.109 --> 00:59:07.119 align:start position:0%
violation it's just something for the
 
00:59:09.829 --> 00:59:09.839 align:start position:0%
committee to consider in terms of it
 
00:59:11.510 --> 00:59:11.520 align:start position:0%
seems that the law is working currently
 
00:59:13.750 --> 00:59:13.760 align:start position:0%
in terms of at least charge violate
 
00:59:15.990 --> 00:59:16.000 align:start position:0%
charge offenses for that as a
 
00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:22.710 align:start position:0%
charge offenses for that as a
misdemeanor

00:59:22.710 --> 00:59:22.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:26.549 --> 00:59:26.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:27.750 --> 00:59:27.760 align:start position:0%
certainly we'll take that into
 
00:59:27.760 --> 00:59:38.230 align:start position:0%
certainly we'll take that into
consideration

00:59:38.230 --> 00:59:38.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:38.240 --> 00:59:41.750 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:59:41.750 --> 00:59:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:44.870 --> 00:59:44.880 align:start position:0%
any further discussion on 1661 now
 
00:59:47.510 --> 00:59:47.520 align:start position:0%
before we
 
00:59:49.589 --> 00:59:49.599 align:start position:0%
represent hennessy do you have days
 
00:59:53.030 --> 00:59:53.040 align:start position:0%
which are good for you or to meet
 
00:59:55.430 --> 00:59:55.440 align:start position:0%
let's try and get something here
 
00:59:57.349 --> 00:59:57.359 align:start position:0%
it took me an hour today just trying to
 
01:00:00.549 --> 01:00:00.559 align:start position:0%
schedule one meeting
 
01:00:02.549 --> 01:00:02.559 align:start position:0%

01:00:11.510 --> 01:00:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:13.270 --> 01:00:13.280 align:start position:0%
you should be done your education
 
01:00:15.349 --> 01:00:15.359 align:start position:0%
meetings by
 
01:00:17.510 --> 01:00:17.520 align:start position:0%
they're going half hour in lengths
 
01:00:24.549 --> 01:00:24.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:27.270 --> 01:00:27.280 align:start position:0%
is monday
 
01:00:37.109 --> 01:00:37.119 align:start position:0%

11 30 is the new proposal
 
01:00:39.690 --> 01:00:43.910 align:start position:0%
11 30 is the new proposal
[Laughter]

01:00:43.910 --> 01:00:43.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:46.230 --> 01:00:46.240 align:start position:0%
11 looks good for me
 
01:00:50.870 --> 01:00:50.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:57.270 --> 01:00:57.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:03.109 --> 01:01:03.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:03.119 --> 01:01:04.150 align:start position:0%
 
any

01:01:20.470 --> 01:01:20.480 align:start position:0%
okay we will we'll set the next one for

hopefully we'll have air conditioning by

01:01:27.990 --> 01:01:28.000 align:start position:0%
then
 
01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:31.430 align:start position:0%
then
hope

01:01:31.430 --> 01:01:31.440 align:start position:0%

burger

01:01:34.390 --> 01:01:34.400 align:start position:0%
burger
 
01:01:36.630 --> 01:01:36.640 align:start position:0%
yes let's just be clear
 
01:01:36.640 --> 01:01:37.510 align:start position:0%
yes let's just be clear
what

01:01:37.510 --> 01:01:37.520 align:start position:0%
what
 
01:01:40.630 --> 01:01:40.640 align:start position:0%
we need to come back on monday for okay
 
01:01:40.640 --> 01:01:41.910 align:start position:0%
we need to come back on monday for okay
okay

01:01:41.910 --> 01:01:41.920 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:01:47.510 --> 01:01:47.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:47.520 --> 01:01:50.309 align:start position:0%
 
400

01:01:50.309 --> 01:01:50.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:51.829 --> 01:01:51.839 align:start position:0%
which is
 
01:01:53.829 --> 01:01:53.839 align:start position:0%
all of that
 
01:01:53.839 --> 01:01:56.630 align:start position:0%
all of that
um

01:01:56.630 --> 01:01:56.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:56.640 --> 01:01:59.430 align:start position:0%
 
on

01:01:59.430 --> 01:01:59.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:01.029 --> 01:02:01.039 align:start position:0%
all of the
 
01:02:04.549 --> 01:02:04.559 align:start position:0%
stuff for hhs
 
01:02:08.870 --> 01:02:08.880 align:start position:0%
we had one problem there
 
01:02:08.880 --> 01:02:09.990 align:start position:0%
we had one problem there
the

01:02:09.990 --> 01:02:10.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:02:14.150 --> 01:02:14.160 align:start position:0%
senate had a seated to the house
 
01:02:16.069 --> 01:02:16.079 align:start position:0%
but we still need to solve that problem
 
01:02:18.950 --> 01:02:18.960 align:start position:0%
is that correct i think
 
01:02:21.750 --> 01:02:21.760 align:start position:0%
that we just need an amendment
 
01:02:23.670 --> 01:02:23.680 align:start position:0%
to reflect the
 
01:02:25.510 --> 01:02:25.520 align:start position:0%
house version
 
01:02:28.069 --> 01:02:28.079 align:start position:0%
from your committee and representative
 
01:02:29.670 --> 01:02:29.680 align:start position:0%
pearson's committee
 
01:02:31.510 --> 01:02:31.520 align:start position:0%
which the department has agreed to so i
 
01:02:35.029 --> 01:02:35.039 align:start position:0%
think on 400 the only issue
 
01:02:37.270 --> 01:02:37.280 align:start position:0%
is whether we're going to change to a
 
01:02:42.069 --> 01:02:42.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:44.630 --> 01:02:44.640 align:start position:0%
i believe that's the only issue
 
01:02:46.710 --> 01:02:46.720 align:start position:0%
for us
 
01:02:49.270 --> 01:02:49.280 align:start position:0%
and will accede to
 
01:02:49.280 --> 01:02:50.390 align:start position:0%
and will accede to
everything

01:02:50.390 --> 01:02:50.400 align:start position:0%
everything
 
01:02:52.549 --> 01:02:52.559 align:start position:0%
representative umberger that the house
 
01:02:54.390 --> 01:02:54.400 align:start position:0%
did and then
 
01:02:57.349 --> 01:02:57.359 align:start position:0%
just try to iron out that one issue of
 
01:03:03.190 --> 01:03:03.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:05.750 --> 01:03:05.760 align:start position:0%
okay yeah if
 
01:03:08.549 --> 01:03:08.559 align:start position:0%
if i i also understand
 
01:03:12.150 --> 01:03:12.160 align:start position:0%
i know you basically um
 
01:03:13.270 --> 01:03:13.280 align:start position:0%
i tl
 
01:03:14.829 --> 01:03:14.839 align:start position:0%
the house
 
01:03:18.150 --> 01:03:18.160 align:start position:0%
position uh
 
01:03:20.390 --> 01:03:20.400 align:start position:0%
is that right or wrong yeah
 
01:03:22.069 --> 01:03:22.079 align:start position:0%
except i don't know
 
01:03:24.710 --> 01:03:24.720 align:start position:0%
but anyhow um
 
01:03:28.470 --> 01:03:28.480 align:start position:0%
we did have an additional
 
01:03:30.390 --> 01:03:30.400 align:start position:0%
amendment that was
 
01:03:33.750 --> 01:03:33.760 align:start position:0%
uh part of the um
 
01:03:33.760 --> 01:03:34.630 align:start position:0%
uh part of the um
house

01:03:34.630 --> 01:03:34.640 align:start position:0%
house
 
01:03:34.640 --> 01:03:36.789 align:start position:0%
house
position

01:03:36.789 --> 01:03:36.799 align:start position:0%
position
 
01:03:39.589 --> 01:03:39.599 align:start position:0%
and did you want to go over that
 
01:03:41.510 --> 01:03:41.520 align:start position:0%
uh representative
 
01:03:43.589 --> 01:03:43.599 align:start position:0%
no we already spoke about that a little
 
01:03:45.430 --> 01:03:45.440 align:start position:0%
earlier and uh
 
01:03:46.950 --> 01:03:46.960 align:start position:0%
senator bradley mentioned that he
 
01:03:49.430 --> 01:03:49.440 align:start position:0%
thought they were
 
01:03:50.789 --> 01:03:50.799 align:start position:0%
unable to
 
01:03:53.670 --> 01:03:53.680 align:start position:0%
go with that that is the amendment like
 
01:03:55.829 --> 01:03:55.839 align:start position:0%
we talked about before
 
01:04:00.470 --> 01:04:00.480 align:start position:0%
um hb430 we sent uh sb430 sorry
 
01:04:02.950 --> 01:04:02.960 align:start position:0%
uh that we sent to the senate and that
 
01:04:06.789 --> 01:04:06.799 align:start position:0%
was non-concurred and that's how the 430
 
01:04:09.349 --> 01:04:09.359 align:start position:0%
ended up attached to 1661 the senate
 
01:04:12.230 --> 01:04:12.240 align:start position:0%
version okay so i apologize but i can't
 
01:04:16.549 --> 01:04:16.559 align:start position:0%
remember what that bill was 10 40
 
01:04:19.190 --> 01:04:19.200 align:start position:0%
10 44
 
01:04:21.750 --> 01:04:21.760 align:start position:0%
10 44 yes that's what we non-concurred
 
01:04:30.710 --> 01:04:30.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:32.069 --> 01:04:32.079 align:start position:0%
you have all the information you need
 
01:04:36.950 --> 01:04:36.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:40.549 --> 01:04:40.559 align:start position:0%
that we can get today
 
01:04:43.270 --> 01:04:43.280 align:start position:0%
and we're going to um
 
01:04:45.190 --> 01:04:45.200 align:start position:0%
we're holding on the parking garage if
 
01:04:48.230 --> 01:04:48.240 align:start position:0%
i'm not mistaken so
 
01:04:50.309 --> 01:04:50.319 align:start position:0%
we need to uh
 
01:04:56.950 --> 01:04:56.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:58.870 --> 01:04:58.880 align:start position:0%
is there any
 
01:05:00.789 --> 01:05:00.799 align:start position:0%
issue with the parking garage
 
01:05:02.390 --> 01:05:02.400 align:start position:0%
i didn't hear there was any issues
 
01:05:05.109 --> 01:05:05.119 align:start position:0%
regarding the parking garage there isn't
 
01:05:07.109 --> 01:05:07.119 align:start position:0%
it's the dollars associated with the
 
01:05:10.549 --> 01:05:10.559 align:start position:0%
parking garage as i understand it
 
01:05:10.559 --> 01:05:12.230 align:start position:0%
parking garage as i understand it
and

01:05:12.230 --> 01:05:12.240 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:05:13.349 --> 01:05:13.359 align:start position:0%
that's a
 
01:05:13.359 --> 01:05:15.190 align:start position:0%
that's a
discussion

01:05:15.190 --> 01:05:15.200 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
01:05:16.789 --> 01:05:16.799 align:start position:0%
i think representative albert and i
 
01:05:18.150 --> 01:05:18.160 align:start position:0%
might want to have an offline
 
01:05:20.950 --> 01:05:20.960 align:start position:0%
conversation about this
 
01:05:22.950 --> 01:05:22.960 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah
 
01:05:25.750 --> 01:05:25.760 align:start position:0%
we have 9.35 million there in in that
 
01:05:25.760 --> 01:05:27.270 align:start position:0%
we have 9.35 million there in in that
bill

01:05:27.270 --> 01:05:27.280 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:05:29.430 --> 01:05:29.440 align:start position:0%
so that's where we'll leave it for today
 
01:05:30.789 --> 01:05:30.799 align:start position:0%
and you can have that discussion
 
01:05:32.710 --> 01:05:32.720 align:start position:0%
represent amberger with uh senator
 
01:05:37.430 --> 01:05:37.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:37.440 --> 01:05:38.549 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:05:38.549 --> 01:05:38.559 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:05:39.829 --> 01:05:39.839 align:start position:0%
so we've got
 
01:05:43.029 --> 01:05:43.039 align:start position:0%
what one amendment to do
 
01:05:45.270 --> 01:05:45.280 align:start position:0%
on hhs
 
01:05:51.349 --> 01:05:51.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:52.789 --> 01:05:52.799 align:start position:0%
i think what
 
01:05:55.270 --> 01:05:55.280 align:start position:0%
maybe the easiest way to
 
01:05:58.630 --> 01:05:58.640 align:start position:0%
resolve this is if you're a very able
 
01:05:58.640 --> 01:05:59.910 align:start position:0%
resolve this is if you're a very able
committee

01:05:59.910 --> 01:05:59.920 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:05:59.920 --> 01:06:00.789 align:start position:0%
committee
um

01:06:00.789 --> 01:06:00.799 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:03.750 --> 01:06:03.760 align:start position:0%
assistant researcher researcher comes in
 
01:06:06.549 --> 01:06:06.559 align:start position:0%
with an amendment that reflects
 
01:06:09.510 --> 01:06:09.520 align:start position:0%
the house version of
 
01:06:09.520 --> 01:06:11.910 align:start position:0%
the house version of
um

01:06:11.910 --> 01:06:11.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:15.910 --> 01:06:15.920 align:start position:0%
senate bill 430 as approved by both the
 
01:06:18.710 --> 01:06:18.720 align:start position:0%
house hhs committee and representative
 
01:06:20.870 --> 01:06:20.880 align:start position:0%
umberger's committee
 
01:06:22.630 --> 01:06:22.640 align:start position:0%
then will
 
01:06:26.230 --> 01:06:26.240 align:start position:0%
decide on violation or misdemeanor but i
 
01:06:29.190 --> 01:06:29.200 align:start position:0%
think everything else is good to go
 
01:06:31.829 --> 01:06:31.839 align:start position:0%
so if we had that amendment we should be
 
01:06:32.950 --> 01:06:32.960 align:start position:0%
able to
 
01:06:38.789 --> 01:06:38.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:41.109 --> 01:06:41.119 align:start position:0%
so you'd fold in this amendment right
 
01:06:44.230 --> 01:06:44.240 align:start position:0%
here regarding the cte
 
01:06:53.349 --> 01:06:53.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:55.670 --> 01:06:55.680 align:start position:0%
okay yes sir
 
01:06:57.029 --> 01:06:57.039 align:start position:0%

01:07:25.039 --> 01:07:38.789 align:start position:0%
 
is

01:07:38.789 --> 01:07:38.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:54.829 --> 01:07:54.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:54.839 --> 01:07:56.630 align:start position:0%

01:07:58.789 --> 01:07:58.799 align:start position:0%
