00:03:21.649 --> 00:03:21.659 align:start position:0%
one and two uh very large documents so
 
00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:24.300 align:start position:0%
just want to thank them before you you
 
00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:26.700 align:start position:0%
have three documents you have a surplus
 
00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:34.280 align:start position:0%
and you have Amendment
 
00:03:37.009 --> 00:03:37.019 align:start position:0%
1244h which is an amendment to House
 
00:03:41.089 --> 00:03:41.099 align:start position:0%
Bill 1A that's your operating budget and
 
00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:42.560 align:start position:0%
then you have an amendment
 
00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:45.239 align:start position:0%
1247h which is your amendment to House
 
00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:47.580 align:start position:0%
Bill 2 uh when I say your Amendment
 
00:03:49.369 --> 00:03:49.379 align:start position:0%
based on all the actions you've taken to
 
00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:50.890 align:start position:0%
based on all the actions you've taken to
date

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:50.900 align:start position:0%
date
 
00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:53.340 align:start position:0%
quickly just on House Bill one you'll
 
00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:55.260 align:start position:0%
notice it's pretty small this is in a
 
00:03:58.309 --> 00:03:58.319 align:start position:0%
format it's a strikeout insert format uh
 
00:04:00.289 --> 00:04:00.299 align:start position:0%
pretty hard to read the clerks do like
 
00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:01.680 align:start position:0%
this they don't have to print the whole
 
00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:04.680 align:start position:0%
800 page document but just so you know
 
00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:06.840 align:start position:0%
once this is approved by the committee
 
00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:08.940 align:start position:0%
on our website we will put up a compare
 
00:04:10.729 --> 00:04:10.739 align:start position:0%
report which is easier for the members
 
00:04:12.649 --> 00:04:12.659 align:start position:0%
and the public to read and to see the
 
00:04:14.809 --> 00:04:14.819 align:start position:0%
differences between the governor on in
 
00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:16.500 align:start position:0%
the house finance position
 
00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:17.750 align:start position:0%
the house finance position
up

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:17.760 align:start position:0%
up
 
00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:20.280 align:start position:0%
so just to get right into the Surplus
 
00:04:23.629 --> 00:04:23.639 align:start position:0%
statement you are balanced this based on
 
00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:25.560 align:start position:0%
all the actions uh taken in the house
 
00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:27.120 align:start position:0%
finance committee the combined General
 
00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:29.820 align:start position:0%
and education trust fund is a balanced
 
00:04:34.249 --> 00:04:34.259 align:start position:0%
spending plan right now uh 23
 
00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:37.080 align:start position:0%
you can see that house finance ends with
 
00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:40.500 align:start position:0%
a balance of about 44 million dollars in
 
00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:42.840 align:start position:0%
the general fund which based on statute
 
00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:44.340 align:start position:0%
would be transferred into their any day
 
00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:47.580 align:start position:0%
fund bringing the balance to about 203.9
 
00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:50.340 align:start position:0%
million as we sit here today the rainy
 
00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:53.280 align:start position:0%
day fund balance is 159.9 so you'd bring
 
00:04:55.189 --> 00:04:55.199 align:start position:0%
it up over 200 million with your
 
00:04:55.199 --> 00:04:57.409 align:start position:0%
it up over 200 million with your
proposals

00:04:57.409 --> 00:04:57.419 align:start position:0%
proposals
 
00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:02.160 align:start position:0%
an FY 2024 for house finance
 
00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:04.800 align:start position:0%
you do end with a balance after transfer
 
00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:05.780 align:start position:0%
of about
 
00:05:08.629 --> 00:05:08.639 align:start position:0%
164.7 million dollars since that is the
 
00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:11.460 align:start position:0%
middle year of the biennium anything
 
00:05:14.629 --> 00:05:14.639 align:start position:0%
carries forward into Row one on the top
 
00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:16.440 align:start position:0%
of um
 
00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:19.500 align:start position:0%
under 25 so that's your beginning
 
00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:20.940 align:start position:0%
balance as you combined beginning
 
00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:22.800 align:start position:0%
balance for General and education trust
 
00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:24.960 align:start position:0%
fund and I'll get into the various funds
 
00:05:28.249 --> 00:05:28.259 align:start position:0%
as we move forward uh based on the uh
 
00:05:31.129 --> 00:05:31.139 align:start position:0%
the revenues as adopted by house Ways
 
00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:33.060 align:start position:0%
and Means or proposed by house waste
 
00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:35.580 align:start position:0%
means and house resolution 17 as well as
 
00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:37.320 align:start position:0%
the revenue adjustments and the
 
00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:40.500 align:start position:0%
Amendments contained in house bill 2.
 
00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:42.660 align:start position:0%
you have about 3.1 billion dollars in
 
00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:45.900 align:start position:0%
Revenue offset by about 3.2 million
 
00:05:48.129 --> 00:05:48.139 align:start position:0%
billion dollars in expenditures
 
00:05:50.629 --> 00:05:50.639 align:start position:0%
resulting in a cumulative ending balance
 
00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:53.460 align:start position:0%
with that balance forward of about 52.2
 
00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:56.940 align:start position:0%
million dollars at the end of 25. again
 
00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:00.120 align:start position:0%
based on statute any balance remaining
 
00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:01.680 align:start position:0%
in the general fund at the end of the
 
00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:03.060 align:start position:0%
biennium would be transferred to the
 
00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:05.820 align:start position:0%
rainy day fund that 52.2 million would
 
00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:07.440 align:start position:0%
be transferred to the rainy day fund
 
00:06:09.409 --> 00:06:09.419 align:start position:0%
resulting in a balanced estimated
 
00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:13.020 align:start position:0%
balance at the end of 25 of about 256
 
00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:17.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:19.129 --> 00:06:19.139 align:start position:0%
if we go I'm just going to not go
 
00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:20.940 align:start position:0%
through all the pages of the Surplus
 
00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:22.969 align:start position:0%
through all the pages of the Surplus
statement

00:06:22.969 --> 00:06:22.979 align:start position:0%
statement
 
00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:24.720 align:start position:0%
just high level
 
00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:26.880 align:start position:0%
how does the general fund
 
00:06:29.689 --> 00:06:29.699 align:start position:0%
um compare to where the governor came
 
00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:32.400 align:start position:0%
you'll see two large
 
00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:34.560 align:start position:0%
differences between the governor as you
 
00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:37.380 align:start position:0%
know you had a discussion relative to
 
00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:40.680 align:start position:0%
revenue that goes into the general fund
 
00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:42.600 align:start position:0%
and education trust fund the house did
 
00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:46.020 align:start position:0%
propose to move an additional
 
00:06:47.809 --> 00:06:47.819 align:start position:0%
um I think it was almost 300 million
 
00:06:49.909 --> 00:06:49.919 align:start position:0%
dollars in education trust and revenue
 
00:06:51.890 --> 00:06:51.900 align:start position:0%
to the general fund the reason for that
 
00:06:55.969 --> 00:06:55.979 align:start position:0%
was to fund to also move the School
 
00:06:57.710 --> 00:06:57.720 align:start position:0%
building Aid and a couple other programs
 
00:07:00.409 --> 00:07:00.419 align:start position:0%
but then to allow for available funds to
 
00:07:01.730 --> 00:07:01.740 align:start position:0%
fund other
 
00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:02.570 align:start position:0%
fund other
um

00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:02.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:07:04.309 --> 00:07:04.319 align:start position:0%
requests in your other divisions
 
00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:06.780 align:start position:0%
division three had a almost a 70 million
 
00:07:08.629 --> 00:07:08.639 align:start position:0%
dollar increase for Medicaid rates that
 
00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:11.100 align:start position:0%
they needed to fund so when you look on
 
00:07:13.249 --> 00:07:13.259 align:start position:0%
your line six review total revenues you
 
00:07:15.170 --> 00:07:15.180 align:start position:0%
can see 23 is the same that's based on
 
00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:16.380 align:start position:0%
current law but you can see the
 
00:07:18.469 --> 00:07:18.479 align:start position:0%
difference between the revenues between
 
00:07:20.809 --> 00:07:20.819 align:start position:0%
the governor and the house after you
 
00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:22.860 align:start position:0%
account for all the adjustments house
 
00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:24.840 align:start position:0%
about almost 2.1 billion dollars in
 
00:07:28.309 --> 00:07:28.319 align:start position:0%
Revenue versus 1.9 for the governor in
 
00:07:32.450 --> 00:07:32.460 align:start position:0%
24 about 2.1 in 25 versus the governors
 
00:07:35.570 --> 00:07:35.580 align:start position:0%
of 1.9 and 25.
 
00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:38.340 align:start position:0%
offset by expenditures about two billion
 
00:07:40.029 --> 00:07:40.039 align:start position:0%
dollars in house finance and 24
 
00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:42.180 align:start position:0%
resulting in an ending balance of about
 
00:07:45.770 --> 00:07:45.780 align:start position:0%
86 million dollars uh in 24. that
 
00:07:48.529 --> 00:07:48.539 align:start position:0%
carries forward onto Row one and then if
 
00:07:50.749 --> 00:07:50.759 align:start position:0%
you go through the uh the sheet again it
 
00:07:52.370 --> 00:07:52.380 align:start position:0%
will bring you down to a positive
 
00:07:56.570 --> 00:07:56.580 align:start position:0%
balance of 94.7 it does uh the proposed
 
00:07:58.550 --> 00:07:58.560 align:start position:0%
plan does require a transfer to the
 
00:08:01.689 --> 00:08:01.699 align:start position:0%
education trust fund of 42.5 million
 
00:08:04.670 --> 00:08:04.680 align:start position:0%
resulting in an ending balance of 52.2
 
00:08:08.510 --> 00:08:08.520 align:start position:0%
which again goes into the general fund
 
00:08:10.850 --> 00:08:10.860 align:start position:0%
page three is just your base Revenue
 
00:08:12.650 --> 00:08:12.660 align:start position:0%
estimates you remember that discussion
 
00:08:14.330 --> 00:08:14.340 align:start position:0%
on the house floor the house ways means
 
00:08:15.890 --> 00:08:15.900 align:start position:0%
presented their revenue estimates this
 
00:08:17.689 --> 00:08:17.699 align:start position:0%
is just your base Revenue estimates and
 
00:08:19.070 --> 00:08:19.080 align:start position:0%
you can see where the differences are
 
00:08:21.770 --> 00:08:21.780 align:start position:0%
there for the journal fund
 
00:08:24.950 --> 00:08:24.960 align:start position:0%
page four beginning on page four is what
 
00:08:27.050 --> 00:08:27.060 align:start position:0%
we call our schedule two we pay a lot of
 
00:08:28.670 --> 00:08:28.680 align:start position:0%
attention to this a lot of the updates
 
00:08:31.189 --> 00:08:31.199 align:start position:0%
we've been providing throughout the um
 
00:08:33.829 --> 00:08:33.839 align:start position:0%
your discussions have used a lot of
 
00:08:35.949 --> 00:08:35.959 align:start position:0%
these adjustments your swim split
 
00:08:39.010 --> 00:08:39.020 align:start position:0%
communication Services tax
 
00:08:42.310 --> 00:08:42.320 align:start position:0%
decisions interests and dividends taxes
 
00:08:45.350 --> 00:08:45.360 align:start position:0%
multi-state Auditors and then some uh
 
00:08:47.630 --> 00:08:47.640 align:start position:0%
yes I have a question over here sure
 
00:08:49.850 --> 00:08:49.860 align:start position:0%
some Edwards
 
00:08:52.250 --> 00:08:52.260 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chair I I'm just looking
 
00:08:56.389 --> 00:08:56.399 align:start position:0%
at uh page three on uh line seven for
 
00:08:59.509 --> 00:08:59.519 align:start position:0%
interest in dividends tax I'm going over
 
00:09:03.530 --> 00:09:03.540 align:start position:0%
to the right where it says fy25 yep uh
 
00:09:06.250 --> 00:09:06.260 align:start position:0%
both the governor and the house finance
 
00:09:09.590 --> 00:09:09.600 align:start position:0%
uh is is using the same Revenue
 
00:09:13.910 --> 00:09:13.920 align:start position:0%
projection of 89.4 million yes and and I
 
00:09:16.130 --> 00:09:16.140 align:start position:0%
unders I thought I understood that one
 
00:09:18.889 --> 00:09:18.899 align:start position:0%
of the effects of an hb2 item related to
 
00:09:23.329 --> 00:09:23.339 align:start position:0%
the IND tax might influence this number
 
00:09:26.030 --> 00:09:26.040 align:start position:0%
yes these are the base Revenue estimates
 
00:09:28.370 --> 00:09:28.380 align:start position:0%
based on current law what if you return
 
00:09:32.810 --> 00:09:32.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:36.290 --> 00:09:36.300 align:start position:0%
and on row five
 
00:09:38.930 --> 00:09:38.940 align:start position:0%
all the way over to the left hand right
 
00:09:41.170 --> 00:09:41.180 align:start position:0%
hand side you can see a reduction of
 
00:09:44.870 --> 00:09:44.880 align:start position:0%
17.4 million dollars so that has been
 
00:09:46.850 --> 00:09:46.860 align:start position:0%
taken out of those estimates we keep the
 
00:09:50.030 --> 00:09:50.040 align:start position:0%
estimates on the schedule one identical
 
00:09:53.449 --> 00:09:53.459 align:start position:0%
to base thank you so much sure
 
00:09:56.090 --> 00:09:56.100 align:start position:0%
and then your appropriation adjustments
 
00:09:57.889 --> 00:09:57.899 align:start position:0%
I'll just go over a few there are many
 
00:10:00.530 --> 00:10:00.540 align:start position:0%
pages of appropriation adjustments
 
00:10:01.910 --> 00:10:01.920 align:start position:0%
um the first one I just want to point
 
00:10:05.150 --> 00:10:05.160 align:start position:0%
out is 23 if you look on row 11 your
 
00:10:07.009 --> 00:10:07.019 align:start position:0%
statutory fiscal governor and Council
 
00:10:08.930 --> 00:10:08.940 align:start position:0%
estimated Appropriations when the
 
00:10:11.030 --> 00:10:11.040 align:start position:0%
governor had released his budget in
 
00:10:13.490 --> 00:10:13.500 align:start position:0%
February there are about 15.9 million
 
00:10:16.370 --> 00:10:16.380 align:start position:0%
dollars of Appropriations based on
 
00:10:18.230 --> 00:10:18.240 align:start position:0%
actions of fiscal and actions through
 
00:10:20.690 --> 00:10:20.700 align:start position:0%
statute with these open warrants there
 
00:10:23.389 --> 00:10:23.399 align:start position:0%
was about 25.7 million dollars so that
 
00:10:25.430 --> 00:10:25.440 align:start position:0%
was almost a 9 million dollar hit that
 
00:10:28.009 --> 00:10:28.019 align:start position:0%
the um almost a 10 million hit that the
 
00:10:29.810 --> 00:10:29.820 align:start position:0%
house finance committee needed to take
 
00:10:31.790 --> 00:10:31.800 align:start position:0%
this is a number that will change
 
00:10:33.410 --> 00:10:33.420 align:start position:0%
throughout the process it will change
 
00:10:35.150 --> 00:10:35.160 align:start position:0%
from the Senate process it will change
 
00:10:37.370 --> 00:10:37.380 align:start position:0%
prior to the close of the fiscal year in
 
00:10:39.530 --> 00:10:39.540 align:start position:0%
June so that's just a number that you
 
00:10:41.530 --> 00:10:41.540 align:start position:0%
had to account for
 
00:10:44.870 --> 00:10:44.880 align:start position:0%
legislative Specialists from 2022 the
 
00:10:46.430 --> 00:10:46.440 align:start position:0%
governor in the house have the same
 
00:10:47.889 --> 00:10:47.899 align:start position:0%
numbers at about
 
00:10:51.829 --> 00:10:51.839 align:start position:0%
265.2 and then you have individual
 
00:10:51.839 --> 00:10:52.730 align:start position:0%
265.2 and then you have individual
um

00:10:52.730 --> 00:10:52.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:55.670 --> 00:10:55.680 align:start position:0%
individual pieces of legislation on row
 
00:10:58.250 --> 00:10:58.260 align:start position:0%
14 15 and 16 you have Senate bill one
 
00:11:00.889 --> 00:11:00.899 align:start position:0%
which is your new Services Center you
 
00:11:02.810 --> 00:11:02.820 align:start position:0%
have House Bill 384 which is the
 
00:11:05.269 --> 00:11:05.279 align:start position:0%
legislative parking garage which was
 
00:11:07.610 --> 00:11:07.620 align:start position:0%
22.5 million which was offset with
 
00:11:09.590 --> 00:11:09.600 align:start position:0%
you'll see a schedule 2 adjustment down
 
00:11:11.930 --> 00:11:11.940 align:start position:0%
below because the governor had initially
 
00:11:14.090 --> 00:11:14.100 align:start position:0%
proposed to fund that in his budget and
 
00:11:15.829 --> 00:11:15.839 align:start position:0%
then the adult parole board was about a
 
00:11:17.690 --> 00:11:17.700 align:start position:0%
hundred and three thousand dollars
 
00:11:21.590 --> 00:11:21.600 align:start position:0%
what we did is from rows 18 down we put
 
00:11:23.449 --> 00:11:23.459 align:start position:0%
it in Department we combine them by
 
00:11:25.069 --> 00:11:25.079 align:start position:0%
department so you can see for the
 
00:11:27.230 --> 00:11:27.240 align:start position:0%
various departments what was provided
 
00:11:29.389 --> 00:11:29.399 align:start position:0%
with Appropriations if there's a zero
 
00:11:31.130 --> 00:11:31.140 align:start position:0%
next to the governor's amount that means
 
00:11:34.370 --> 00:11:34.380 align:start position:0%
that the house took it out so that in 23
 
00:11:36.410 --> 00:11:36.420 align:start position:0%
if we turn to page I believe it's page
 
00:11:36.420 --> 00:11:40.430 align:start position:0%
if we turn to page I believe it's page
six

00:11:40.430 --> 00:11:40.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:43.870 --> 00:11:43.880 align:start position:0%
in total house finance uh appropriation
 
00:11:46.569 --> 00:11:46.579 align:start position:0%
adjustments totaled about
 
00:11:49.490 --> 00:11:49.500 align:start position:0%
529.7 million dollars as compared to the
 
00:11:51.490 --> 00:11:51.500 align:start position:0%
governors of about
 
00:11:55.130 --> 00:11:55.140 align:start position:0%
505.6 one of the largest appropriation
 
00:11:57.050 --> 00:11:57.060 align:start position:0%
adjustments the house took was 50
 
00:11:58.670 --> 00:11:58.680 align:start position:0%
million dollar appropriation towards the
 
00:12:00.949 --> 00:12:00.959 align:start position:0%
unfunded accrue liability in 23 and
 
00:12:02.870 --> 00:12:02.880 align:start position:0%
that's why you see uh partial of that
 
00:12:04.430 --> 00:12:04.440 align:start position:0%
difference you'll know as you went
 
00:12:06.110 --> 00:12:06.120 align:start position:0%
through divisions how you reduce some
 
00:12:08.150 --> 00:12:08.160 align:start position:0%
Appropriations in 23 and that helped to
 
00:12:11.389 --> 00:12:11.399 align:start position:0%
offset that impact of that I'm going to
 
00:12:14.090 --> 00:12:14.100 align:start position:0%
stay on page six and just go through the
 
00:12:16.730 --> 00:12:16.740 align:start position:0%
governor had about 133.9 million of
 
00:12:19.130 --> 00:12:19.140 align:start position:0%
appropriation adjustments in 24 versus
 
00:12:20.530 --> 00:12:20.540 align:start position:0%
the house of
 
00:12:23.389 --> 00:12:23.399 align:start position:0%
135.6 again the divisions we're going
 
00:12:25.670 --> 00:12:25.680 align:start position:0%
through as they were developing their
 
00:12:27.710 --> 00:12:27.720 align:start position:0%
budget trying to offset any additions
 
00:12:30.170 --> 00:12:30.180 align:start position:0%
with corresponding reductions another
 
00:12:32.930 --> 00:12:32.940 align:start position:0%
question sure because I'm Emerick
 
00:12:35.509 --> 00:12:35.519 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
00:12:37.850 --> 00:12:37.860 align:start position:0%
taking the question is there any way in
 
00:12:40.730 --> 00:12:40.740 align:start position:0%
here that reflects the pay raises or is
 
00:12:49.310 --> 00:12:49.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:51.410 --> 00:12:51.420 align:start position:0%
we haven't got to it yet then don't
 
00:12:53.930 --> 00:12:53.940 align:start position:0%
worry about it it's in there uh it could
 
00:12:58.910 --> 00:12:58.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:02.150 --> 00:13:02.160 align:start position:0%
on row 21 you'll remember the governor
 
00:13:04.190 --> 00:13:04.200 align:start position:0%
appropriated in general funds to sell
 
00:13:07.129 --> 00:13:07.139 align:start position:0%
all General funds 44.9 million dollars
 
00:13:08.470 --> 00:13:08.480 align:start position:0%
and 24
 
00:13:11.569 --> 00:13:11.579 align:start position:0%
54.7 million and 25 the house maintained
 
00:13:13.250 --> 00:13:13.260 align:start position:0%
those Appropriations so you can see the
 
00:13:15.050 --> 00:13:15.060 align:start position:0%
corresponding numbers under the house
 
00:13:17.150 --> 00:13:17.160 align:start position:0%
column as well thank you sure so it's
 
00:13:23.470 --> 00:13:23.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:26.449 --> 00:13:26.459 align:start position:0%
thank you uh Mr chair and thank you Mr
 
00:13:30.050 --> 00:13:30.060 align:start position:0%
Kane so so they're on schedule two on
 
00:13:33.110 --> 00:13:33.120 align:start position:0%
page four line 21.
 
00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:33.710 align:start position:0%
page four line 21.
um

00:13:33.710 --> 00:13:33.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:36.470 --> 00:13:36.480 align:start position:0%
do these do these numbers that are
 
00:13:40.610 --> 00:13:40.620 align:start position:0%
reflected there end up in hb1 or do they
 
00:13:43.970 --> 00:13:43.980 align:start position:0%
just live here in hb2 at what point in
 
00:13:46.690 --> 00:13:46.700 align:start position:0%
other words what point do do these 10
 
00:13:50.269 --> 00:13:50.279 align:start position:0%
affect the salary line in hb1 could
 
00:13:53.150 --> 00:13:53.160 align:start position:0%
could you go through that sure uh so
 
00:13:54.889 --> 00:13:54.899 align:start position:0%
typically these will remain in House
 
00:13:57.889 --> 00:13:57.899 align:start position:0%
Bill 2 as the block Appropriations when
 
00:14:01.670 --> 00:14:01.680 align:start position:0%
the budget is passed at the end of June
 
00:14:03.889 --> 00:14:03.899 align:start position:0%
administrative services in the executive
 
00:14:05.990 --> 00:14:06.000 align:start position:0%
branch then start to roll these figures
 
00:14:08.449 --> 00:14:08.459 align:start position:0%
up into house bill one or the operating
 
00:14:11.810 --> 00:14:11.820 align:start position:0%
budget so you'll on that date so in July
 
00:14:14.030 --> 00:14:14.040 align:start position:0%
right in on July 1 those figures will be
 
00:14:15.410 --> 00:14:15.420 align:start position:0%
rolled up to all the individual
 
00:14:17.690 --> 00:14:17.700 align:start position:0%
departments uh what they do is they draw
 
00:14:20.210 --> 00:14:20.220 align:start position:0%
warrants which is basically allocations
 
00:14:22.610 --> 00:14:22.620 align:start position:0%
to each department on what their share
 
00:14:27.050 --> 00:14:27.060 align:start position:0%
is when you in 26 and 27 when you look
 
00:14:28.850 --> 00:14:28.860 align:start position:0%
at the budget they will be in house bill
 
00:14:30.710 --> 00:14:30.720 align:start position:0%
one any pay raises will be in household
 
00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:31.730 align:start position:0%
one any pay raises will be in household
one

00:14:31.730 --> 00:14:31.740 align:start position:0%
one
 
00:14:33.829 --> 00:14:33.839 align:start position:0%
thank you sure
 
00:14:35.629 --> 00:14:35.639 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman
 
00:14:38.030 --> 00:14:38.040 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire thank you Mr
 
00:14:41.150 --> 00:14:41.160 align:start position:0%
chairman so this is only General funds
 
00:14:43.790 --> 00:14:43.800 align:start position:0%
but I believe there's roughly 150
 
00:14:46.670 --> 00:14:46.680 align:start position:0%
million similar in other and federal
 
00:14:46.680 --> 00:14:48.949 align:start position:0%
million similar in other and federal
funds

00:14:48.949 --> 00:14:48.959 align:start position:0%
funds
 
00:14:52.250 --> 00:14:52.260 align:start position:0%
of pay raises and my colleague is giving
 
00:14:54.769 --> 00:14:54.779 align:start position:0%
me a picture
 
00:14:57.290 --> 00:14:57.300 align:start position:0%
yeah yes so so
 
00:15:00.290 --> 00:15:00.300 align:start position:0%
um because a lot of employees are paid
 
00:15:03.590 --> 00:15:03.600 align:start position:0%
you know like in HHS there's 50 50s and
 
00:15:05.689 --> 00:15:05.699 align:start position:0%
things like that so the total amount of
 
00:15:08.509 --> 00:15:08.519 align:start position:0%
pay raises is more like 250 million or
 
00:15:10.850 --> 00:15:10.860 align:start position:0%
something in that bumper
 
00:15:10.860 --> 00:15:12.050 align:start position:0%
something in that bumper
foreign

00:15:12.050 --> 00:15:12.060 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
00:15:14.990 --> 00:15:15.000 align:start position:0%
yes there's all those dot employees paid
 
00:15:17.389 --> 00:15:17.399 align:start position:0%
out of the highway fund
 
00:15:20.210 --> 00:15:20.220 align:start position:0%
yes and on page 72 on your Amendment you
 
00:15:21.470 --> 00:15:21.480 align:start position:0%
don't have to go there if you unless you
 
00:15:23.689 --> 00:15:23.699 align:start position:0%
want to but in total the pay raises are
 
00:15:27.290 --> 00:15:27.300 align:start position:0%
about 101.5 million all funds in 24 and
 
00:15:31.490 --> 00:15:31.500 align:start position:0%
about 124 million in 25 so about 225
 
00:15:33.350 --> 00:15:33.360 align:start position:0%
million in total funds of which the
 
00:15:35.210 --> 00:15:35.220 align:start position:0%
journal fund has about 100 million of
 
00:15:35.220 --> 00:15:39.530 align:start position:0%
journal fund has about 100 million of
that

00:15:39.530 --> 00:15:39.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:39.540 --> 00:15:43.250 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:15:43.250 --> 00:15:43.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:45.590 --> 00:15:45.600 align:start position:0%
so those are your adjustments which all
 
00:15:48.949 --> 00:15:48.959 align:start position:0%
been reflected on page one and page two
 
00:15:50.930 --> 00:15:50.940 align:start position:0%
if you turn to page seven this is the
 
00:15:55.670 --> 00:15:55.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:59.449 --> 00:15:59.459 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:03.949 --> 00:16:03.959 align:start position:0%
so in 23 uh the the only differences uh
 
00:16:06.290 --> 00:16:06.300 align:start position:0%
between the governor and the house
 
00:16:07.970 --> 00:16:07.980 align:start position:0%
finance committee proposal are really
 
00:16:09.230 --> 00:16:09.240 align:start position:0%
your house Ways and Means Revenue
 
00:16:11.750 --> 00:16:11.760 align:start position:0%
estimates you can see on our Row 4 your
 
00:16:13.850 --> 00:16:13.860 align:start position:0%
estimated revenues Governor had about
 
00:16:18.410 --> 00:16:18.420 align:start position:0%
100 1.2 billion dollars whereas house
 
00:16:21.430 --> 00:16:21.440 align:start position:0%
finance or house ways it means had about
 
00:16:23.930 --> 00:16:23.940 align:start position:0%
1.17 so it was about a 30 million dollar
 
00:16:26.629 --> 00:16:26.639 align:start position:0%
difference in revenues you can see the
 
00:16:28.790 --> 00:16:28.800 align:start position:0%
Appropriations were about the same but
 
00:16:30.650 --> 00:16:30.660 align:start position:0%
that Revenue did result in a change to
 
00:16:31.910 --> 00:16:31.920 align:start position:0%
the current year balance and your
 
00:16:33.769 --> 00:16:33.779 align:start position:0%
cumulative ending balance so the
 
00:16:35.689 --> 00:16:35.699 align:start position:0%
governors based on his Revenue estimates
 
00:16:37.850 --> 00:16:37.860 align:start position:0%
had the education trust fund ending 23
 
00:16:40.069 --> 00:16:40.079 align:start position:0%
and beginning 24 since the education
 
00:16:42.350 --> 00:16:42.360 align:start position:0%
trust fund isn't a non-lapsing
 
00:16:45.889 --> 00:16:45.899 align:start position:0%
in at the end of 23 at 221 million the
 
00:16:48.949 --> 00:16:48.959 align:start position:0%
house finance had 183.8 million dollars
 
00:16:51.829 --> 00:16:51.839 align:start position:0%
and that was just related to the revenue
 
00:16:53.509 --> 00:16:53.519 align:start position:0%
estimates and again that will change as
 
00:16:56.150 --> 00:16:56.160 align:start position:0%
we go through the process
 
00:16:58.910 --> 00:16:58.920 align:start position:0%
if we go into fy24 you can see on Row
 
00:17:00.769 --> 00:17:00.779 align:start position:0%
one the beginning balances how there is
 
00:17:02.930 --> 00:17:02.940 align:start position:0%
a difference because of those initial
 
00:17:05.630 --> 00:17:05.640 align:start position:0%
Revenue estimates and then you have your
 
00:17:07.549 --> 00:17:07.559 align:start position:0%
estimated revenues
 
00:17:10.069 --> 00:17:10.079 align:start position:0%
um another on row four between the house
 
00:17:11.990 --> 00:17:12.000 align:start position:0%
ways means and the governor another 30
 
00:17:14.210 --> 00:17:14.220 align:start position:0%
or so million dollar uh below the
 
00:17:16.250 --> 00:17:16.260 align:start position:0%
governor your schedule for adjustments
 
00:17:18.409 --> 00:17:18.419 align:start position:0%
are where you see your adjustments to
 
00:17:21.110 --> 00:17:21.120 align:start position:0%
your general fund and education trust
 
00:17:22.970 --> 00:17:22.980 align:start position:0%
fund tax splits for the business taxes
 
00:17:25.730 --> 00:17:25.740 align:start position:0%
Governor initially had 75 million
 
00:17:28.069 --> 00:17:28.079 align:start position:0%
dollars which was based on his 65 35
 
00:17:32.510 --> 00:17:32.520 align:start position:0%
split house finance has a 77.5 22.5
 
00:17:34.250 --> 00:17:34.260 align:start position:0%
split between the general education
 
00:17:36.230 --> 00:17:36.240 align:start position:0%
trust fund so that's a negative
 
00:17:39.590 --> 00:17:39.600 align:start position:0%
adjustment of 223 million dollars so
 
00:17:41.930 --> 00:17:41.940 align:start position:0%
your total revenue for house finance a
 
00:17:44.090 --> 00:17:44.100 align:start position:0%
little over a billion dollars
 
00:17:47.990 --> 00:17:48.000 align:start position:0%
uh budget Appropriations on line nine
 
00:17:52.250 --> 00:17:52.260 align:start position:0%
in 24 the governor had about 1.2 billion
 
00:17:53.930 --> 00:17:53.940 align:start position:0%
dollars of Education trust fund
 
00:17:56.390 --> 00:17:56.400 align:start position:0%
expenditures you can see the house has
 
00:17:59.690 --> 00:17:59.700 align:start position:0%
about 1.1 billion dollars for Education
 
00:18:02.750 --> 00:18:02.760 align:start position:0%
trust fund expenditures uh reason for
 
00:18:04.909 --> 00:18:04.919 align:start position:0%
that is because with the general fund
 
00:18:07.310 --> 00:18:07.320 align:start position:0%
move that Revenue also went School
 
00:18:09.350 --> 00:18:09.360 align:start position:0%
building Aid and other programs that
 
00:18:11.870 --> 00:18:11.880 align:start position:0%
weren't related to adequacy Charter
 
00:18:14.630 --> 00:18:14.640 align:start position:0%
Schools or education Freedom accounts
 
00:18:17.029 --> 00:18:17.039 align:start position:0%
so in the end the cumulative ending
 
00:18:20.029 --> 00:18:20.039 align:start position:0%
balance if you count the 183.7 million
 
00:18:22.970 --> 00:18:22.980 align:start position:0%
dollars coming forward from 23 uh you
 
00:18:24.350 --> 00:18:24.360 align:start position:0%
offset it against a negative current
 
00:18:27.049 --> 00:18:27.059 align:start position:0%
year balance of about 105. still have a
 
00:18:28.549 --> 00:18:28.559 align:start position:0%
positive balance the education trust
 
00:18:30.830 --> 00:18:30.840 align:start position:0%
funded about 78.4 and that's after
 
00:18:32.750 --> 00:18:32.760 align:start position:0%
moving all the revenue and it's some
 
00:18:32.760 --> 00:18:34.250 align:start position:0%
moving all the revenue and it's some
expenditures

00:18:34.250 --> 00:18:34.260 align:start position:0%
expenditures
 
00:18:37.010 --> 00:18:37.020 align:start position:0%
that's 78.4 carries forward into the
 
00:18:39.770 --> 00:18:39.780 align:start position:0%
beginning of 25 and then you can see the
 
00:18:41.930 --> 00:18:41.940 align:start position:0%
adjustments as well on row five in the
 
00:18:43.870 --> 00:18:43.880 align:start position:0%
far right about
 
00:18:46.490 --> 00:18:46.500 align:start position:0%
224.8 for the house finance committee
 
00:18:48.909 --> 00:18:48.919 align:start position:0%
compared to the governor's 74.8
 
00:18:51.370 --> 00:18:51.380 align:start position:0%
resulting in total revenues of about
 
00:18:55.990 --> 00:18:56.000 align:start position:0%
1.048 billion dollars offset on row nine
 
00:18:59.090 --> 00:18:59.100 align:start position:0%
by about 1.1 million dollars in
 
00:18:59.100 --> 00:19:00.890 align:start position:0%
by about 1.1 million dollars in
expenditures

00:19:00.890 --> 00:19:00.900 align:start position:0%
expenditures
 
00:19:02.930 --> 00:19:02.940 align:start position:0%
um and then you can see on 10 the big
 
00:19:05.510 --> 00:19:05.520 align:start position:0%
change in fiscal year 25s the governor
 
00:19:08.150 --> 00:19:08.160 align:start position:0%
initially had a 75 million uh dollar
 
00:19:10.130 --> 00:19:10.140 align:start position:0%
appropriation to school building aid
 
00:19:12.289 --> 00:19:12.299 align:start position:0%
from the education trust fund on June
 
00:19:14.090 --> 00:19:14.100 align:start position:0%
30th 25 so it wouldn't be until the end
 
00:19:16.490 --> 00:19:16.500 align:start position:0%
of biennium based on the house finance
 
00:19:18.230 --> 00:19:18.240 align:start position:0%
actions they had removed that additional
 
00:19:21.289 --> 00:19:21.299 align:start position:0%
75 million but you can see a 20 million
 
00:19:22.669 --> 00:19:22.679 align:start position:0%
dollar adjustment and you can see that
 
00:19:25.430 --> 00:19:25.440 align:start position:0%
on the fall on I believe it's on page
 
00:19:27.830 --> 00:19:27.840 align:start position:0%
nine but just to stay on page seven for
 
00:19:31.070 --> 00:19:31.080 align:start position:0%
now that 20 million and the 10 million
 
00:19:34.010 --> 00:19:34.020 align:start position:0%
in 24 has to do with an adjustment that
 
00:19:36.350 --> 00:19:36.360 align:start position:0%
division two felt prudent to make into
 
00:19:38.750 --> 00:19:38.760 align:start position:0%
account for set aside for the increased
 
00:19:40.669 --> 00:19:40.679 align:start position:0%
free and reduced population based on an
 
00:19:42.830 --> 00:19:42.840 align:start position:0%
action taken by fiscal committee uh
 
00:19:44.450 --> 00:19:44.460 align:start position:0%
earlier this year where it increased
 
00:19:46.490 --> 00:19:46.500 align:start position:0%
your free and reduced lunch eligibility
 
00:19:48.590 --> 00:19:48.600 align:start position:0%
was not accounted for in the governor's
 
00:19:51.710 --> 00:19:51.720 align:start position:0%
proposal it is just an it's a set aside
 
00:19:53.510 --> 00:19:53.520 align:start position:0%
or accounting for that potential impact
 
00:19:56.570 --> 00:19:56.580 align:start position:0%
act from the house the house finance
 
00:19:57.830 --> 00:19:57.840 align:start position:0%
committee's budget
 
00:20:00.350 --> 00:20:00.360 align:start position:0%
so in the end with the change in the
 
00:20:03.049 --> 00:20:03.059 align:start position:0%
revenues the Appropriations Uh current
 
00:20:05.330 --> 00:20:05.340 align:start position:0%
year balance of a negative 121 it does
 
00:20:07.730 --> 00:20:07.740 align:start position:0%
require transfer from the general fund
 
00:20:10.610 --> 00:20:10.620 align:start position:0%
of about 42.5 million dollars to bring
 
00:20:14.750 --> 00:20:14.760 align:start position:0%
the balance to zero at the end of 25.
 
00:20:16.789 --> 00:20:16.799 align:start position:0%
and then your car your page eight and
 
00:20:18.049 --> 00:20:18.059 align:start position:0%
nine are really just uh they're
 
00:20:20.810 --> 00:20:20.820 align:start position:0%
mimicking your your general fund
 
00:20:22.669 --> 00:20:22.679 align:start position:0%
um kind of your order and your detail
 
00:20:23.930 --> 00:20:23.940 align:start position:0%
where you have your revenues and then
 
00:20:26.690 --> 00:20:26.700 align:start position:0%
you have your adjustments uh so
 
00:20:29.450 --> 00:20:29.460 align:start position:0%
this is a balanced uh spending plan for
 
00:20:32.029 --> 00:20:32.039 align:start position:0%
that's house finance right now has uh
 
00:20:34.070 --> 00:20:34.080 align:start position:0%
based on this and I can answer any
 
00:20:36.890 --> 00:20:36.900 align:start position:0%
questions that anyone has
 
00:20:38.750 --> 00:20:38.760 align:start position:0%
any questions from committee members
 
00:20:40.850 --> 00:20:40.860 align:start position:0%
push the red light if you have a
 
00:20:40.860 --> 00:20:43.549 align:start position:0%
push the red light if you have a
question

00:20:43.549 --> 00:20:43.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:45.650 --> 00:20:45.660 align:start position:0%
a lot of back and forth on all these
 
00:20:47.570 --> 00:20:47.580 align:start position:0%
schedules a lot of busy work to make
 
00:20:52.490 --> 00:20:52.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:55.789 --> 00:20:55.799 align:start position:0%
no questions okay thank you on please
 
00:20:57.230 --> 00:20:57.240 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:20:59.270 --> 00:20:59.280 align:start position:0%
um so that's all I have for my
 
00:21:01.850 --> 00:21:01.860 align:start position:0%
presentation and then we will be I'll
 
00:21:03.169 --> 00:21:03.179 align:start position:0%
still be here as you have your
 
00:21:05.390 --> 00:21:05.400 align:start position:0%
conversations if there are any um
 
00:21:08.750 --> 00:21:08.760 align:start position:0%
additional detail that you need from me
 
00:21:10.610 --> 00:21:10.620 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman I'll ask a question
 
00:21:13.070 --> 00:21:13.080 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire thank you will
 
00:21:14.630 --> 00:21:14.640 align:start position:0%
you have a surplus statement for the
 
00:21:19.070 --> 00:21:19.080 align:start position:0%
highway fund and others yes thanks uh
 
00:21:20.210 --> 00:21:20.220 align:start position:0%
thank you for asking representative
 
00:21:23.029 --> 00:21:23.039 align:start position:0%
McGuire so we will post a surplus
 
00:21:24.950 --> 00:21:24.960 align:start position:0%
statement for the highway fund and the
 
00:21:26.510 --> 00:21:26.520 align:start position:0%
Fish and Game fund which are one pagers
 
00:21:28.070 --> 00:21:28.080 align:start position:0%
so you'll probably enjoy reading those
 
00:21:30.529 --> 00:21:30.539 align:start position:0%
more uh just to give you kind of as far
 
00:21:32.210 --> 00:21:32.220 align:start position:0%
as a balanced Highway and Fish and Game
 
00:21:34.010 --> 00:21:34.020 align:start position:0%
Highway fund ends with a balance of
 
00:21:36.890 --> 00:21:36.900 align:start position:0%
about 7.2 million dollars I think the
 
00:21:38.630 --> 00:21:38.640 align:start position:0%
governor was about 13 but you'll
 
00:21:40.370 --> 00:21:40.380 align:start position:0%
remember in fiscal you just had to give
 
00:21:42.830 --> 00:21:42.840 align:start position:0%
6 million towards winter maintenance
 
00:21:44.690 --> 00:21:44.700 align:start position:0%
um and then the fish and game fund ends
 
00:21:46.549 --> 00:21:46.559 align:start position:0%
almost identical to where the governor
 
00:21:49.190 --> 00:21:49.200 align:start position:0%
was about 4.5 million dollars at the end
 
00:21:52.310 --> 00:21:52.320 align:start position:0%
of um 25 and we will post those to our
 
00:22:00.470 --> 00:22:00.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:05.930 --> 00:22:05.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:08.390 --> 00:22:08.400 align:start position:0%
okay I guess you're going to brief HP
 
00:22:09.950 --> 00:22:09.960 align:start position:0%
one or hb2 or some of the other people
 
00:22:12.289 --> 00:22:12.299 align:start position:0%
going to do that that's all I have for
 
00:22:13.970 --> 00:22:13.980 align:start position:0%
my presentation now
 
00:22:13.980 --> 00:22:18.590 align:start position:0%
my presentation now
so

00:22:18.590 --> 00:22:18.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:22.070 --> 00:22:22.080 align:start position:0%
um these other packets those that
 
00:22:26.690 --> 00:22:26.700 align:start position:0%
sure sorry so the other packets 12 4 4H
 
00:22:29.029 --> 00:22:29.039 align:start position:0%
are your house bill one amendments so
 
00:22:30.590 --> 00:22:30.600 align:start position:0%
that's your big operating budget
 
00:22:32.930 --> 00:22:32.940 align:start position:0%
document uh so if adopted those will be
 
00:22:35.270 --> 00:22:35.280 align:start position:0%
folded into the budget system
 
00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:36.710 align:start position:0%
folded into the budget system
um

00:22:36.710 --> 00:22:36.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:22:39.890 --> 00:22:39.900 align:start position:0%
it's kind of a hard document to read
 
00:22:42.110 --> 00:22:42.120 align:start position:0%
as far as being user friendly we will
 
00:22:43.909 --> 00:22:43.919 align:start position:0%
post a compare report which is a
 
00:22:45.529 --> 00:22:45.539 align:start position:0%
document that I think the legislature
 
00:22:47.630 --> 00:22:47.640 align:start position:0%
and the public find more useful but this
 
00:22:50.450 --> 00:22:50.460 align:start position:0%
is the actual the the legislation or the
 
00:22:54.070 --> 00:22:54.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:56.810 --> 00:22:56.820 align:start position:0%
hb2 has been shortened up considerably
 
00:22:59.450 --> 00:22:59.460 align:start position:0%
it has we're able to staple it so you
 
00:23:02.210 --> 00:23:02.220 align:start position:0%
remember when you received yeah when you
 
00:23:05.930 --> 00:23:05.940 align:start position:0%
when you received House Bill 2 we had to
 
00:23:09.409 --> 00:23:09.419 align:start position:0%
staple it was over 200 pages in our
 
00:23:12.169 --> 00:23:12.179 align:start position:0%
copier can staple up to 100 so it didn't
 
00:23:12.179 --> 00:23:13.130 align:start position:0%
copier can staple up to 100 so it didn't
work

00:23:13.130 --> 00:23:13.140 align:start position:0%
work
 
00:23:15.049 --> 00:23:15.059 align:start position:0%
um you have brought this down to close
 
00:23:17.450 --> 00:23:17.460 align:start position:0%
to 140 Pages the big one of the big
 
00:23:19.130 --> 00:23:19.140 align:start position:0%
changes you made was in division one
 
00:23:21.950 --> 00:23:21.960 align:start position:0%
relative to some of the oplc changes uh
 
00:23:23.570 --> 00:23:23.580 align:start position:0%
that removed
 
00:23:27.470 --> 00:23:27.480 align:start position:0%
a considerable amount of uh paper so yes
 
00:23:30.110 --> 00:23:30.120 align:start position:0%
so in House Bill 2 this reflects all
 
00:23:31.789 --> 00:23:31.799 align:start position:0%
your changes that were adopted in your
 
00:23:33.529 --> 00:23:33.539 align:start position:0%
individual House Bill two Amendment
 
00:23:35.090 --> 00:23:35.100 align:start position:0%
packets that you've taken over the past
 
00:23:37.850 --> 00:23:37.860 align:start position:0%
couple of days we did look over this
 
00:23:40.490 --> 00:23:40.500 align:start position:0%
with OLS and our staff to ensure that we
 
00:23:42.590 --> 00:23:42.600 align:start position:0%
did catch everything and we're confident
 
00:23:44.810 --> 00:23:44.820 align:start position:0%
that everything is reflected here as
 
00:23:46.909 --> 00:23:46.919 align:start position:0%
well as any Appropriations are captured
 
00:23:48.409 --> 00:23:48.419 align:start position:0%
on the Surplus statement on our schedule
 
00:23:52.070 --> 00:23:52.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:52.080 --> 00:23:55.789 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:23:55.789 --> 00:23:55.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:58.850 --> 00:23:58.860 align:start position:0%
so this is the end of all the LBA
 
00:24:01.130 --> 00:24:01.140 align:start position:0%
presentations it is yes
 
00:24:04.070 --> 00:24:04.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:07.250 --> 00:24:07.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:09.110 --> 00:24:09.120 align:start position:0%
so we do we need another vote on
 
00:24:11.930 --> 00:24:11.940 align:start position:0%
accepting the uh
 
00:24:14.870 --> 00:24:14.880 align:start position:0%
Surplus statement Surplus statement will
 
00:24:17.029 --> 00:24:17.039 align:start position:0%
just reflect the intent uh how the
 
00:24:18.169 --> 00:24:18.179 align:start position:0%
committee votes so you don't need to
 
00:24:20.210 --> 00:24:20.220 align:start position:0%
take a vote on that uh the committee
 
00:24:23.690 --> 00:24:23.700 align:start position:0%
would need to vote on 1244 H first which
 
00:24:25.250 --> 00:24:25.260 align:start position:0%
is the amendment to house will one
 
00:24:27.130 --> 00:24:27.140 align:start position:0%
followed by
 
00:24:29.690 --> 00:24:29.700 align:start position:0%
1247h which is the amendment to house
 
00:24:33.529 --> 00:24:33.539 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:37.190 --> 00:24:37.200 align:start position:0%
okay the clerk will call a roll on House
 
00:24:44.690 --> 00:24:44.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:44.700 --> 00:24:47.870 align:start position:0%
 
onest

00:24:47.870 --> 00:24:47.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:49.789 --> 00:24:49.799 align:start position:0%
representative Heath thank you Mr chair
 
00:24:52.970 --> 00:24:52.980 align:start position:0%
are you calling for a vote on the
 
00:24:54.950 --> 00:24:54.960 align:start position:0%
amended HP one
 
00:24:56.390 --> 00:24:56.400 align:start position:0%
I am
 
00:24:59.090 --> 00:24:59.100 align:start position:0%
um could I make a comment first of
 
00:25:01.070 --> 00:25:01.080 align:start position:0%
course thank you
 
00:25:01.080 --> 00:25:02.270 align:start position:0%
course thank you
um

00:25:02.270 --> 00:25:02.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:04.610 --> 00:25:04.620 align:start position:0%
Mr chair
 
00:25:06.230 --> 00:25:06.240 align:start position:0%
there are lots of good things in this
 
00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:07.250 align:start position:0%
there are lots of good things in this
budget

00:25:07.250 --> 00:25:07.260 align:start position:0%
budget
 
00:25:09.230 --> 00:25:09.240 align:start position:0%
lots of good things
 
00:25:12.350 --> 00:25:12.360 align:start position:0%
and it deeply
 
00:25:14.090 --> 00:25:14.100 align:start position:0%
bothers me
 
00:25:17.330 --> 00:25:17.340 align:start position:0%
not to be able to vote for this budget
 
00:25:19.250 --> 00:25:19.260 align:start position:0%
I was hoping that we could reach some
 
00:25:19.260 --> 00:25:21.230 align:start position:0%
I was hoping that we could reach some
compromises

00:25:21.230 --> 00:25:21.240 align:start position:0%
compromises
 
00:25:23.870 --> 00:25:23.880 align:start position:0%
but one of my reasons is building Aid I
 
00:25:25.390 --> 00:25:25.400 align:start position:0%
wish we could find
 
00:25:28.610 --> 00:25:28.620 align:start position:0%
more funding for that yesterday I tried
 
00:25:31.190 --> 00:25:31.200 align:start position:0%
to get more funding for adult education
 
00:25:33.710 --> 00:25:33.720 align:start position:0%
one of my bigger concerns is the amount
 
00:25:36.289 --> 00:25:36.299 align:start position:0%
of money going into the afas
 
00:25:39.649 --> 00:25:39.659 align:start position:0%
last year we spent 14.6 million
 
00:25:43.250 --> 00:25:43.260 align:start position:0%
in this biennium budget you have 29.8
 
00:25:45.010 --> 00:25:45.020 align:start position:0%
and 24
 
00:25:48.169 --> 00:25:48.179 align:start position:0%
29.25 to the f8
 
00:25:51.049 --> 00:25:51.059 align:start position:0%
oh EFA efas
 
00:25:51.059 --> 00:25:52.730 align:start position:0%
oh EFA efas
um

00:25:52.730 --> 00:25:52.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:55.070 --> 00:25:55.080 align:start position:0%
I've continually asked that the
 
00:25:57.049 --> 00:25:57.059 align:start position:0%
oversight for these go to the Department
 
00:26:00.409 --> 00:26:00.419 align:start position:0%
of Ed even if they RFP it out to the
 
00:26:02.210 --> 00:26:02.220 align:start position:0%
current agency
 
00:26:04.730 --> 00:26:04.740 align:start position:0%
I'm deeply concerned that's over almost
 
00:26:07.669 --> 00:26:07.679 align:start position:0%
60 million dollars going out
 
00:26:09.890 --> 00:26:09.900 align:start position:0%
I'm pleased with the increase in tuition
 
00:26:12.769 --> 00:26:12.779 align:start position:0%
and transportation that's wonderful
 
00:26:15.769 --> 00:26:15.779 align:start position:0%
but but Mr chair
 
00:26:18.049 --> 00:26:18.059 align:start position:0%
there were just some things in this
 
00:26:20.210 --> 00:26:20.220 align:start position:0%
budget that right now
 
00:26:22.549 --> 00:26:22.559 align:start position:0%
if we could come to a compromise I would
 
00:26:25.010 --> 00:26:25.020 align:start position:0%
feel so much better about some of these
 
00:26:25.020 --> 00:26:26.029 align:start position:0%
feel so much better about some of these
items

00:26:26.029 --> 00:26:26.039 align:start position:0%
items
 
00:26:28.250 --> 00:26:28.260 align:start position:0%
that at this point in time I just can't
 
00:26:31.310 --> 00:26:31.320 align:start position:0%
vote on this budget as much as I want to
 
00:26:34.610 --> 00:26:34.620 align:start position:0%
I mean the raises for our state workers
 
00:26:38.450 --> 00:26:38.460 align:start position:0%
are critical and it is intensely painful
 
00:26:40.850 --> 00:26:40.860 align:start position:0%
for me not to step forward and vote for
 
00:26:40.860 --> 00:26:41.870 align:start position:0%
for me not to step forward and vote for
that

00:26:41.870 --> 00:26:41.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:26:45.350 --> 00:26:45.360 align:start position:0%
so Mr a chair if there's any way that we
 
00:26:47.149 --> 00:26:47.159 align:start position:0%
could delay the vote
 
00:26:50.630 --> 00:26:50.640 align:start position:0%
um to do some further negotiations I
 
00:26:53.390 --> 00:26:53.400 align:start position:0%
would ask for that option if it is all
 
00:26:53.400 --> 00:26:54.769 align:start position:0%
would ask for that option if it is all
possible

00:26:54.769 --> 00:26:54.779 align:start position:0%
possible
 
00:27:00.169 --> 00:27:00.179 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:02.090 --> 00:27:02.100 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards
 
00:27:04.610 --> 00:27:04.620 align:start position:0%
I I I don't know if this is for for you
 
00:27:08.450 --> 00:27:08.460 align:start position:0%
Mr chair or for Mr Kane but if we ended
 
00:27:11.510 --> 00:27:11.520 align:start position:0%
up with the legislature unable to agree
 
00:27:14.269 --> 00:27:14.279 align:start position:0%
to a budget this year and we had to go
 
00:27:17.090 --> 00:27:17.100 align:start position:0%
into a continuing resolution what what
 
00:27:21.230 --> 00:27:21.240 align:start position:0%
happens to hb2 does this does this just
 
00:27:22.970 --> 00:27:22.980 align:start position:0%
get set aside and not go into effect
 
00:27:26.330 --> 00:27:26.340 align:start position:0%
what I mean what what happens in a
 
00:27:33.289 --> 00:27:33.299 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:35.450 --> 00:27:35.460 align:start position:0%
it depends uh the continuing resolution
 
00:27:37.430 --> 00:27:37.440 align:start position:0%
at the end of the process is really a
 
00:27:39.350 --> 00:27:39.360 align:start position:0%
negotiation that comes between house
 
00:27:40.909 --> 00:27:40.919 align:start position:0%
senate House and Senate leadership and
 
00:27:43.310 --> 00:27:43.320 align:start position:0%
the governor and both a majority and
 
00:27:46.730 --> 00:27:46.740 align:start position:0%
minority parties uh there's no
 
00:27:46.740 --> 00:27:47.750 align:start position:0%
minority parties uh there's no
um

00:27:47.750 --> 00:27:47.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:49.909 --> 00:27:49.919 align:start position:0%
one answer on what the continuing
 
00:27:51.950 --> 00:27:51.960 align:start position:0%
resolution can do it can appropriate the
 
00:27:53.690 --> 00:27:53.700 align:start position:0%
same level of funds received last year
 
00:27:56.090 --> 00:27:56.100 align:start position:0%
it could include Provisions uh
 
00:27:58.010 --> 00:27:58.020 align:start position:0%
potentially Provisions related in-house
 
00:28:00.049 --> 00:28:00.059 align:start position:0%
Bill 2 but typically historically since
 
00:28:01.909 --> 00:28:01.919 align:start position:0%
I have been here it has not included any
 
00:28:04.250 --> 00:28:04.260 align:start position:0%
provisions that are included in House
 
00:28:06.350 --> 00:28:06.360 align:start position:0%
Bill too but again that's something that
 
00:28:08.870 --> 00:28:08.880 align:start position:0%
will be discussed with leadership as we
 
00:28:11.690 --> 00:28:11.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:13.490 --> 00:28:13.500 align:start position:0%
Mr chair
 
00:28:16.430 --> 00:28:16.440 align:start position:0%
I would request if I may
 
00:28:19.010 --> 00:28:19.020 align:start position:0%
I would request that we recess
 
00:28:23.630 --> 00:28:23.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:25.549 --> 00:28:25.559 align:start position:0%
I know there are further negotiations
 
00:28:29.930 --> 00:28:29.940 align:start position:0%
going on between the two parties so
 
00:28:33.769 --> 00:28:33.779 align:start position:0%
I will uh exceed to your request and
 
00:28:35.149 --> 00:28:35.159 align:start position:0%
otherwise we'll have to come back
 
00:28:35.159 --> 00:28:37.010 align:start position:0%
otherwise we'll have to come back
tomorrow

00:28:37.010 --> 00:28:37.020 align:start position:0%
tomorrow
 
00:28:39.230 --> 00:28:39.240 align:start position:0%
if we can't come to an agreement
 
00:28:39.240 --> 00:28:44.110 align:start position:0%
if we can't come to an agreement
so

00:28:44.110 --> 00:28:44.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:47.529 --> 00:28:47.539 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:51.049 --> 00:28:51.059 align:start position:0%
well that's a suggestion too if we
 
00:28:52.789 --> 00:28:52.799 align:start position:0%
have a suggestion
 
00:28:54.830 --> 00:28:54.840 align:start position:0%
we come back tomorrow because otherwise
 
00:28:57.430 --> 00:28:57.440 align:start position:0%
we all sit here waiting for some results
 
00:29:00.110 --> 00:29:00.120 align:start position:0%
from negotiations
 
00:29:02.750 --> 00:29:02.760 align:start position:0%
and I tie up your whole day
 
00:29:07.250 --> 00:29:07.260 align:start position:0%
which may go beyond one o'clock so
 
00:29:09.289 --> 00:29:09.299 align:start position:0%
and I don't think I don't think there
 
00:29:10.610 --> 00:29:10.620 align:start position:0%
will be any
 
00:29:13.669 --> 00:29:13.679 align:start position:0%
movement and negotiations I think that
 
00:29:18.110 --> 00:29:18.120 align:start position:0%
some of the requests are intractable
 
00:29:22.370 --> 00:29:22.380 align:start position:0%
representative thank you Mr chair
 
00:29:24.409 --> 00:29:24.419 align:start position:0%
um I just wanted to suggest that
 
00:29:26.750 --> 00:29:26.760 align:start position:0%
personally I already kind of assumed
 
00:29:29.269 --> 00:29:29.279 align:start position:0%
I'll be here all day today but I
 
00:29:30.950 --> 00:29:30.960 align:start position:0%
definitely did not assume I'll be here
 
00:29:32.990 --> 00:29:33.000 align:start position:0%
tomorrow I will be here tomorrow of
 
00:29:35.090 --> 00:29:35.100 align:start position:0%
course if needed but if there is any way
 
00:29:37.370 --> 00:29:37.380 align:start position:0%
in which this can get uh
 
00:29:41.570 --> 00:29:41.580 align:start position:0%
dealt with today uh I think that it
 
00:29:43.850 --> 00:29:43.860 align:start position:0%
would be ideal but as I said whatever
 
00:29:50.470 --> 00:29:50.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:52.549 --> 00:29:52.559 align:start position:0%
representative Edward
 
00:29:57.230 --> 00:29:57.240 align:start position:0%
um you know it seems to me uh given how
 
00:29:58.970 --> 00:29:58.980 align:start position:0%
little progress there was made yesterday
 
00:30:01.970 --> 00:30:01.980 align:start position:0%
in the negotiations that uh today could
 
00:30:03.710 --> 00:30:03.720 align:start position:0%
really take a long time just to have
 
00:30:07.010 --> 00:30:07.020 align:start position:0%
those discussions and uh in order to
 
00:30:10.010 --> 00:30:10.020 align:start position:0%
allow for the the folks in the crowd and
 
00:30:11.990 --> 00:30:12.000 align:start position:0%
the rest of us to figure out what we're
 
00:30:14.810 --> 00:30:14.820 align:start position:0%
doing I I do I do think the idea to
 
00:30:18.470 --> 00:30:18.480 align:start position:0%
recess until tomorrow morning has a
 
00:30:22.070 --> 00:30:22.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:26.690 --> 00:30:26.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:28.850 --> 00:30:28.860 align:start position:0%
representative Griffin
 
00:30:33.110 --> 00:30:33.120 align:start position:0%
yeah I I just like to say that I listen
 
00:30:35.750 --> 00:30:35.760 align:start position:0%
carefully to Representatives he's
 
00:30:40.310 --> 00:30:40.320 align:start position:0%
Remax and I suspect that all of us in
 
00:30:42.169 --> 00:30:42.179 align:start position:0%
this room
 
00:30:46.850 --> 00:30:46.860 align:start position:0%
have areas of these budget documents
 
00:30:49.610 --> 00:30:49.620 align:start position:0%
that we're unhappy about
 
00:30:52.789 --> 00:30:52.799 align:start position:0%
but I think overall I think it's a
 
00:30:54.669 --> 00:30:54.679 align:start position:0%
wonderful budget
 
00:30:58.250 --> 00:30:58.260 align:start position:0%
there's a compromises in there everybody
 
00:31:01.070 --> 00:31:01.080 align:start position:0%
gave a little bit
 
00:31:03.950 --> 00:31:03.960 align:start position:0%
um and I I see no
 
00:31:06.649 --> 00:31:06.659 align:start position:0%
representative emmerich
 
00:31:08.570 --> 00:31:08.580 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
00:31:10.490 --> 00:31:10.500 align:start position:0%

00:31:10.500 --> 00:31:11.690 align:start position:0%
I'm of the opinion that Finance should
vote

00:31:11.690 --> 00:31:11.700 align:start position:0%

00:31:13.850 --> 00:31:13.860 align:start position:0%

00:31:16.430 --> 00:31:16.440 align:start position:0%
anything it goes to the house as a floor
 
00:31:16.440 --> 00:31:17.570 align:start position:0%

Amendment

00:31:17.570 --> 00:31:17.580 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
00:31:22.490 --> 00:31:22.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:24.769 --> 00:31:24.779 align:start position:0%
we have one member absent
 
00:31:26.930 --> 00:31:26.940 align:start position:0%
so if if he's better
 
00:31:30.529 --> 00:31:30.539 align:start position:0%
maybe we have a full committee tomorrow
 
00:31:33.889 --> 00:31:33.899 align:start position:0%
when we come back so
 
00:31:36.470 --> 00:31:36.480 align:start position:0%

00:32:35.810 --> 00:32:35.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:01.570 --> 00:33:01.580 align:start position:0%
