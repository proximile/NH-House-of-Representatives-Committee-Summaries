that we we're going to do at this point
 
00:12:02.389 --> 00:12:02.399 align:start position:0%
is let's review the process we're going
 
00:12:04.629 --> 00:12:04.639 align:start position:0%
to revoke
 
00:12:08.790 --> 00:12:08.800 align:start position:0%
the itl motion originally made
 
00:12:10.470 --> 00:12:10.480 align:start position:0%
and then we'll look at further motions
 
00:12:12.710 --> 00:12:12.720 align:start position:0%
down the road if that if that
 
00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:14.230 align:start position:0%
down the road if that if that
passes

00:12:14.230 --> 00:12:14.240 align:start position:0%
passes
 
00:12:17.829 --> 00:12:17.839 align:start position:0%
mr chair yes don't we have to first vote
 
00:12:20.790 --> 00:12:20.800 align:start position:0%
on the motion to reconsider yes we do
 
00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:21.670 align:start position:0%

okay

00:12:21.670 --> 00:12:21.680 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:12:22.629 --> 00:12:22.639 align:start position:0%
and then
 
00:12:24.150 --> 00:12:24.160 align:start position:0%
as we go through each one of these i
 
00:12:25.430 --> 00:12:25.440 align:start position:0%
think there'll be about two or three
 
00:12:27.110 --> 00:12:27.120 align:start position:0%
votes on each
 
00:12:30.069 --> 00:12:30.079 align:start position:0%

we're now going to vote on the ito yes
 
00:14:18.230 --> 00:14:18.240 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry
 
00:14:19.670 --> 00:14:19.680 align:start position:0%
our first
 
00:14:22.389 --> 00:14:22.399 align:start position:0%
vote was to reconsider
 
00:14:23.430 --> 00:14:23.440 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
00:14:24.790 --> 00:14:24.800 align:start position:0%
now that it's
 
00:14:26.870 --> 00:14:26.880 align:start position:0%
been authorized to reconsider we're
 
00:14:28.470 --> 00:14:28.480 align:start position:0%
going to look at the motions that were
 
00:14:31.110 --> 00:14:31.120 align:start position:0%
made are on the original bill and that
 
00:14:32.790 --> 00:14:32.800 align:start position:0%
bill had
 
00:14:36.230 --> 00:14:36.240 align:start position:0%
passed an itl at that point
 
00:14:37.829 --> 00:14:37.839 align:start position:0%
so now the
 
00:14:39.509 --> 00:14:39.519 align:start position:0%
the motion i'm sorry for that confusion
 
00:14:41.910 --> 00:14:41.920 align:start position:0%
the motion is whether to maintain the
 
00:14:46.949 --> 00:14:46.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:46.959 --> 00:14:48.470 align:start position:0%
 
and

00:14:48.470 --> 00:14:48.480 align:start position:0%

uh may i speak sure thank you
 
00:15:17.430 --> 00:15:17.440 align:start position:0%
um just as we voted on this the other
 
00:15:20.710 --> 00:15:20.720 align:start position:0%
day i'm i support the itl
 
00:15:22.629 --> 00:15:22.639 align:start position:0%
i don't think there's any hope for this
 
00:15:25.509 --> 00:15:25.519 align:start position:0%
bill even if we go to interim study the
 
00:15:27.670 --> 00:15:27.680 align:start position:0%
fact that it's removing someone from
 
00:15:31.110 --> 00:15:31.120 align:start position:0%
elected office just for two absences
 
00:15:34.550 --> 00:15:34.560 align:start position:0%
regardless as if they're excused or not
 
00:15:37.509 --> 00:15:37.519 align:start position:0%
i can look around this room and already
 
00:15:40.310 --> 00:15:40.320 align:start position:0%
count how many people would be removed
 
00:15:41.670 --> 00:15:41.680 align:start position:0%
from their office as state
 
00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:42.949 align:start position:0%
from their office as state
representative

00:15:42.949 --> 00:15:42.959 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:15:45.430 --> 00:15:45.440 align:start position:0%
if the standard of this bill was applied
 
00:15:46.790 --> 00:15:46.800 align:start position:0%
to the house
 
00:15:49.269 --> 00:15:49.279 align:start position:0%
i think it's an irresponsible bill it's
 
00:15:50.790 --> 00:15:50.800 align:start position:0%
vague it's
 
00:15:53.269 --> 00:15:53.279 align:start position:0%
contrary to what's already existing in
 
00:15:55.990 --> 00:15:56.000 align:start position:0%
law and in local ordinances
 
00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:57.269 align:start position:0%
law and in local ordinances
and

00:15:57.269 --> 00:15:57.279 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:16:00.790 --> 00:16:00.800 align:start position:0%
it's it's it's it's a travesty if we
 
00:16:04.550 --> 00:16:04.560 align:start position:0%
can't just put this bill to die a death
 
00:16:06.949 --> 00:16:06.959 align:start position:0%
and just ask yourselves
 
00:16:06.959 --> 00:16:07.749 align:start position:0%
and just ask yourselves
if

00:16:07.749 --> 00:16:07.759 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:16:10.470 --> 00:16:10.480 align:start position:0%
you would be willing to leave your
 
00:16:13.829 --> 00:16:13.839 align:start position:0%
representation upon two excused absences
 
00:16:17.030 --> 00:16:17.040 align:start position:0%
if you're ill hospitalized or whatever
 
00:16:18.949 --> 00:16:18.959 align:start position:0%
i think um
 
00:16:20.870 --> 00:16:20.880 align:start position:0%
if if we can't live up to the standard
 
00:16:22.629 --> 00:16:22.639 align:start position:0%
of this bill we shouldn't expect anybody
 
00:16:26.550 --> 00:16:26.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:28.790 --> 00:16:28.800 align:start position:0%
yes thank you yes uh
 
00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:29.990 align:start position:0%
yes thank you yes uh

gilman
 
00:16:31.670 --> 00:16:31.680 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
00:16:33.990 --> 00:16:34.000 align:start position:0%
first i'd like to
 
00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:35.189 align:start position:0%
first i'd like to
remind

00:16:35.189 --> 00:16:35.199 align:start position:0%
remind
 
00:16:36.470 --> 00:16:36.480 align:start position:0%
members that
 
00:16:39.269 --> 00:16:39.279 align:start position:0%
when we heard the bill originally we had
 
00:16:41.590 --> 00:16:41.600 align:start position:0%
12 people signed up opposed to this
 
00:16:45.030 --> 00:16:45.040 align:start position:0%
legislation and only five in support
 
00:16:46.550 --> 00:16:46.560 align:start position:0%
and the other thing i'd like to point
 
00:16:49.110 --> 00:16:49.120 align:start position:0%
out is we already have an rsa a state
 
00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:50.870 align:start position:0%
out is we already have an rsa a state
law

00:16:50.870 --> 00:16:50.880 align:start position:0%
law
 
00:16:53.670 --> 00:16:53.680 align:start position:0%
for missing four meetings
 
00:16:56.230 --> 00:16:56.240 align:start position:0%
so i'm not i'm not in favor of change
 
00:16:57.910 --> 00:16:57.920 align:start position:0%
lowering it down to two i think that's
 
00:16:57.920 --> 00:16:59.910 align:start position:0%
lowering it down to two i think that's
impractical

00:16:59.910 --> 00:16:59.920 align:start position:0%
impractical
 
00:17:02.710 --> 00:17:02.720 align:start position:0%
thank you representative klee
 
00:17:04.789 --> 00:17:04.799 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um if i remember
 
00:17:06.870 --> 00:17:06.880 align:start position:0%
correctly based on my notes
 
00:17:09.350 --> 00:17:09.360 align:start position:0%
there were um a couple of um
 
00:17:11.189 --> 00:17:11.199 align:start position:0%
issues that got brought up um and one
 
00:17:13.750 --> 00:17:13.760 align:start position:0%
was that it conflicted with rsa and i've
 
00:17:15.110 --> 00:17:15.120 align:start position:0%
written this down i have not double
 
00:17:18.270 --> 00:17:18.280 align:start position:0%
checked it myself so i apologize rsa
 
00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:19.909 align:start position:0%
checked it myself so i apologize rsa
32-15

00:17:19.909 --> 00:17:19.919 align:start position:0%
32-15
 
00:17:22.789 --> 00:17:22.799 align:start position:0%
roman numeral six i believe is what i've
 
00:17:25.189 --> 00:17:25.199 align:start position:0%
written down as well as
 
00:17:27.590 --> 00:17:27.600 align:start position:0%
there was um a couple of comments that
 
00:17:30.630 --> 00:17:30.640 align:start position:0%
we needed to amend the 25 percent to 75
 
00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:31.750 align:start position:0%
we needed to amend the 25 percent to 75
percent

00:17:31.750 --> 00:17:31.760 align:start position:0%
percent
 
00:17:32.950 --> 00:17:32.960 align:start position:0%
basically we're saying if you've missed
 
00:17:35.190 --> 00:17:35.200 align:start position:0%
25 percent of the meetings
 
00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:36.310 align:start position:0%
25 percent of the meetings
um

00:17:36.310 --> 00:17:36.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:17:37.909 --> 00:17:37.919 align:start position:0%
you could be removed
 
00:17:39.990 --> 00:17:40.000 align:start position:0%
that seems like a very low bar
 
00:17:41.830 --> 00:17:41.840 align:start position:0%
to remove someone
 
00:17:43.990 --> 00:17:44.000 align:start position:0%
from a meeting
 
00:17:45.029 --> 00:17:45.039 align:start position:0%
so i
 
00:17:47.029 --> 00:17:47.039 align:start position:0%
i am worried that we're going to pass
 
00:17:49.590 --> 00:17:49.600 align:start position:0%
this without having made these changes
 
00:17:50.950 --> 00:17:50.960 align:start position:0%
and i think that was one of the reasons
 
00:17:52.950 --> 00:17:52.960 align:start position:0%
for the itl was that it just wasn't
 
00:17:55.350 --> 00:17:55.360 align:start position:0%
quite ready for as often too often said
 
00:17:57.669 --> 00:17:57.679 align:start position:0%
ready for prime time thank you
 
00:18:00.789 --> 00:18:00.799 align:start position:0%
thank you representative lasallus yes i
 
00:18:03.590 --> 00:18:03.600 align:start position:0%
i think that the comments of
 
00:18:06.390 --> 00:18:06.400 align:start position:0%
my esteemed colleagues
 
00:18:09.350 --> 00:18:09.360 align:start position:0%
with respect to the problems with with
 
00:18:10.310 --> 00:18:10.320 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
00:18:13.750 --> 00:18:13.760 align:start position:0%
kind of makes the argument for not to
 
00:18:18.070 --> 00:18:18.080 align:start position:0%
otp yet but to study it more attendance
 
00:18:19.350 --> 00:18:19.360 align:start position:0%
at these
 
00:18:22.470 --> 00:18:22.480 align:start position:0%
meetings is very important and people
 
00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:23.510 align:start position:0%
meetings is very important and people
who

00:18:23.510 --> 00:18:23.520 align:start position:0%
who
 
00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:24.549 align:start position:0%
who
uh

00:18:24.549 --> 00:18:24.559 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:18:26.070 --> 00:18:26.080 align:start position:0%
and the
 
00:18:29.190 --> 00:18:29.200 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
00:18:32.710 --> 00:18:32.720 align:start position:0%
does make provisions for people who have
 
00:18:35.590 --> 00:18:35.600 align:start position:0%
an excused absence so
 
00:18:38.390 --> 00:18:38.400 align:start position:0%
what what i'm proposing
 
00:18:40.789 --> 00:18:40.799 align:start position:0%
is that we do an interim study on this
 
00:18:43.190 --> 00:18:43.200 align:start position:0%
bill but we first have to vote down the
 
00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:45.190 align:start position:0%
bill but we first have to vote down the
itl

00:18:45.190 --> 00:18:45.200 align:start position:0%
itl
 
00:18:48.070 --> 00:18:48.080 align:start position:0%
thank you any further yes representative

00:18:50.870 --> 00:18:50.880 align:start position:0%
i have a question from my friend from

for interim study
second

00:22:01.830 --> 00:22:01.840 align:start position:0%
second
 
00:22:03.590 --> 00:22:03.600 align:start position:0%
made and seconded is there any
 
00:22:05.270 --> 00:22:05.280 align:start position:0%
discussion at this point
 
00:22:06.549 --> 00:22:06.559 align:start position:0%
on the bill
 
00:22:08.950 --> 00:22:08.960 align:start position:0%
representative wrong
 
00:22:10.870 --> 00:22:10.880 align:start position:0%
i really don't think interim study is
 
00:22:12.549 --> 00:22:12.559 align:start position:0%
going to fix this i think it just needs
 
00:22:14.470 --> 00:22:14.480 align:start position:0%
to be redrafted
 
00:22:16.470 --> 00:22:16.480 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor didn't even speak to
 
00:22:18.310 --> 00:22:18.320 align:start position:0%
this the person that spoke to it was
 
00:22:20.630 --> 00:22:20.640 align:start position:0%
someone who has a personal grudge
 
00:22:22.390 --> 00:22:22.400 align:start position:0%
against somebody on the merrimack school
 
00:22:24.310 --> 00:22:24.320 align:start position:0%
district budget committee
 
00:22:26.470 --> 00:22:26.480 align:start position:0%
i think this is just a political
 
00:22:28.149 --> 00:22:28.159 align:start position:0%
marching order vote
 
00:22:30.390 --> 00:22:30.400 align:start position:0%
um this is a bad bill
 
00:22:33.029 --> 00:22:33.039 align:start position:0%
if if we held ourselves to this more
 
00:22:34.630 --> 00:22:34.640 align:start position:0%
than half of us in the house wouldn't
 
00:22:36.789 --> 00:22:36.799 align:start position:0%
even be holding our seats
 
00:22:36.799 --> 00:22:37.909 align:start position:0%
even be holding our seats
so

00:22:37.909 --> 00:22:37.919 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:22:40.149 --> 00:22:40.159 align:start position:0%
i'm disappointed in my colleagues for
 
00:22:42.789 --> 00:22:42.799 align:start position:0%
even bringing this bill up again
 
00:22:45.029 --> 00:22:45.039 align:start position:0%
but i'm going to vote
 
00:22:47.669 --> 00:22:47.679 align:start position:0%
against the interim study
 
00:22:51.029 --> 00:22:51.039 align:start position:0%

00:23:00.149 --> 00:23:00.159 align:start position:0%
will be considering the at least
 
00:23:03.750 --> 00:23:03.760 align:start position:0%
one two three four other statutes which
 
00:23:06.710 --> 00:23:06.720 align:start position:0%
will have to be amended in order to
 
00:23:09.430 --> 00:23:09.440 align:start position:0%
accomplish what this bill may try to
 
00:23:09.440 --> 00:23:10.710 align:start position:0%
accomplish what this bill may try to
accomplish

00:23:10.710 --> 00:23:10.720 align:start position:0%

00:23:13.190 --> 00:23:13.200 align:start position:0%

asking if someone would like to

representative melvin second
 
00:28:56.389 --> 00:28:56.399 align:start position:0%
now that the motion has been made in
 
00:28:58.310 --> 00:28:58.320 align:start position:0%
second representative davis the floor is
 
00:28:58.320 --> 00:29:03.510 align:start position:0%
second representative davis the floor is
yours

00:29:03.510 --> 00:29:03.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:06.470 --> 00:29:06.480 align:start position:0%
my question has to do with how the
 
00:29:08.549 --> 00:29:08.559 align:start position:0%
author of the amendment
 
00:29:11.029 --> 00:29:11.039 align:start position:0%
feels that the amended version differs
 
00:29:13.110 --> 00:29:13.120 align:start position:0%
from the existing law
 
00:29:15.269 --> 00:29:15.279 align:start position:0%
what is the substantive change being
 
00:29:16.710 --> 00:29:16.720 align:start position:0%
made here
 
00:29:19.190 --> 00:29:19.200 align:start position:0%
that justifies
 
00:29:36.310 --> 00:29:36.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:39.029 --> 00:29:39.039 align:start position:0%
there was a question do you want to
 
00:29:42.149 --> 00:29:42.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:47.830 --> 00:29:47.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:51.510 --> 00:29:51.520 align:start position:0%
did did you see the portion of the
 
00:29:54.230 --> 00:29:54.240 align:start position:0%
amendment that was struck and then the
 
00:29:57.590 --> 00:29:57.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:59.590 --> 00:29:59.600 align:start position:0%
i didn't write that
 
00:30:03.190 --> 00:30:03.200 align:start position:0%
so i don't have a comment on it
 
00:30:05.350 --> 00:30:05.360 align:start position:0%
so you're offering an amendment that you
 
00:30:06.470 --> 00:30:06.480 align:start position:0%
really don't
 
00:30:08.870 --> 00:30:08.880 align:start position:0%
know why we should support
 
00:30:11.269 --> 00:30:11.279 align:start position:0%
i just think the language is better
 
00:30:14.230 --> 00:30:14.240 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
00:30:15.590 --> 00:30:15.600 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i'd like to know from
 
00:30:18.870 --> 00:30:18.880 align:start position:0%
the author how striking
 
00:30:20.870 --> 00:30:20.880 align:start position:0%
such other regulations related to the
 
00:30:23.190 --> 00:30:23.200 align:start position:0%
public health
 
00:30:24.870 --> 00:30:24.880 align:start position:0%
as in their judgment the health and
 
00:30:28.149 --> 00:30:28.159 align:start position:0%
safety of the people require
 
00:30:30.950 --> 00:30:30.960 align:start position:0%
is improved by unsanitary living
 
00:30:33.269 --> 00:30:33.279 align:start position:0%
conditions can the can the author of the
 
00:30:35.110 --> 00:30:35.120 align:start position:0%
amendment please explain that piece to
 
00:30:35.120 --> 00:30:36.470 align:start position:0%
amendment please explain that piece to
me

00:30:36.470 --> 00:30:36.480 align:start position:0%
me
 
00:30:37.990 --> 00:30:38.000 align:start position:0%
again that's what
 
00:30:39.750 --> 00:30:39.760 align:start position:0%
it's your option to take the question or
 
00:30:39.760 --> 00:30:49.190 align:start position:0%
it's your option to take the question or
not

00:30:49.190 --> 00:30:49.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:51.669 --> 00:30:51.679 align:start position:0%
since we don't have the author present
 
00:30:51.679 --> 00:30:52.870 align:start position:0%
since we don't have the author present
yeah

00:30:52.870 --> 00:30:52.880 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:30:54.630 --> 00:30:54.640 align:start position:0%
in my opinion
 
00:30:54.640 --> 00:30:56.070 align:start position:0%
in my opinion
the

00:30:56.070 --> 00:30:56.080 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:31:01.190 --> 00:31:01.200 align:start position:0%
new language makes it more explicit
 
00:31:03.509 --> 00:31:03.519 align:start position:0%
yes representatives davis
 
00:31:05.750 --> 00:31:05.760 align:start position:0%
in my opinion it makes it very similar
 
00:31:08.310 --> 00:31:08.320 align:start position:0%
to existing law
 
00:31:10.230 --> 00:31:10.240 align:start position:0%
which leads me back to my original
 
00:31:13.830 --> 00:31:13.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:16.310 --> 00:31:16.320 align:start position:0%
representative power
 
00:31:18.710 --> 00:31:18.720 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um if i remember
 
00:31:21.509 --> 00:31:21.519 align:start position:0%
correctly the prime sponsor of this bill
 
00:31:23.350 --> 00:31:23.360 align:start position:0%
came to this committee with an amendment
 
00:31:26.389 --> 00:31:26.399 align:start position:0%
in hand and as a result of the hearing
 
00:31:30.789 --> 00:31:30.799 align:start position:0%
and the feedback that the prime received
 
00:31:32.789 --> 00:31:32.799 align:start position:0%
we have this amendment that's before us
 
00:31:32.799 --> 00:31:33.750 align:start position:0%
we have this amendment that's before us
today

00:31:33.750 --> 00:31:33.760 align:start position:0%
today
 
00:31:36.549 --> 00:31:36.559 align:start position:0%
so based on my recollection
 
00:31:39.190 --> 00:31:39.200 align:start position:0%
there was some concern with um the
 
00:31:41.830 --> 00:31:41.840 align:start position:0%
phrase be repugnant to the constitution
 
00:31:46.070 --> 00:31:46.080 align:start position:0%
and the prime was willing to remove that
 
00:31:46.080 --> 00:31:47.669 align:start position:0%
and the prime was willing to remove that
additionally

00:31:47.669 --> 00:31:47.679 align:start position:0%
additionally
 
00:31:53.590 --> 00:31:53.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:56.149 --> 00:31:56.159 align:start position:0%
that was not supposed to be in there and
 
00:31:57.909 --> 00:31:57.919 align:start position:0%
according to my notes
 
00:32:00.630 --> 00:32:00.640 align:start position:0%
and ols
 
00:32:00.640 --> 00:32:01.590 align:start position:0%
and ols
did

00:32:01.590 --> 00:32:01.600 align:start position:0%
did
 
00:32:03.830 --> 00:32:03.840 align:start position:0%
that was an oversight by ols so that's
 
00:32:05.909 --> 00:32:05.919 align:start position:0%
why that was removed
 
00:32:07.669 --> 00:32:07.679 align:start position:0%
and then um
 
00:32:07.679 --> 00:32:09.029 align:start position:0%
and then um
again

00:32:09.029 --> 00:32:09.039 align:start position:0%
again
 
00:32:11.830 --> 00:32:11.840 align:start position:0%
lines 17 through 30 of the amendment
 
00:32:14.230 --> 00:32:14.240 align:start position:0%
that came to this committee during the
 
00:32:14.240 --> 00:32:15.350 align:start position:0%
that came to this committee during the
hearing

00:32:15.350 --> 00:32:15.360 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
00:32:16.950 --> 00:32:16.960 align:start position:0%
the note was that that was taken
 
00:32:19.350 --> 00:32:19.360 align:start position:0%
directly from vermont
 
00:32:19.360 --> 00:32:20.630 align:start position:0%
directly from vermont
statute

00:32:20.630 --> 00:32:20.640 align:start position:0%
statute
 
00:32:25.269 --> 00:32:25.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:28.310 --> 00:32:28.320 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor decided also to remove
 
00:32:31.190 --> 00:32:31.200 align:start position:0%
that in order to make um the bill more
 
00:32:31.200 --> 00:32:32.230 align:start position:0%
that in order to make um the bill more
clear

00:32:32.230 --> 00:32:32.240 align:start position:0%
clear
 
00:32:32.240 --> 00:32:33.269 align:start position:0%
clear
and

00:32:33.269 --> 00:32:33.279 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:32:35.669 --> 00:32:35.679 align:start position:0%
finally i would would say that with
 
00:32:39.190 --> 00:32:39.200 align:start position:0%
regard to the the questions with regards
 
00:32:41.029 --> 00:32:41.039 align:start position:0%
to how is this amendment different than
 
00:32:44.149 --> 00:32:44.159 align:start position:0%
current statute i would offer that
 
00:32:47.590 --> 00:32:47.600 align:start position:0%
it makes it more focused and more clear
 
00:32:49.190 --> 00:32:49.200 align:start position:0%
and and less
 
00:32:49.200 --> 00:32:50.789 align:start position:0%
and and less
nebulous

00:32:50.789 --> 00:32:50.799 align:start position:0%
nebulous
 
00:32:53.029 --> 00:32:53.039 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative any
 
00:32:55.590 --> 00:32:55.600 align:start position:0%
further comments yes representative ron
 
00:32:57.590 --> 00:32:57.600 align:start position:0%
yeah i support the amendment i think the
 
00:33:00.549 --> 00:33:00.559 align:start position:0%
bill that we voted on yesterday was
 
00:33:03.269 --> 00:33:03.279 align:start position:0%
really flawed it was as i mentioned in
 
00:33:05.430 --> 00:33:05.440 align:start position:0%
my comments yesterday
 
00:33:08.389 --> 00:33:08.399 align:start position:0%
the fact that the word repugnant is so
 
00:33:10.549 --> 00:33:10.559 align:start position:0%
subjective it would be very difficult to
 
00:33:13.430 --> 00:33:13.440 align:start position:0%
give a specific example
 
00:33:14.950 --> 00:33:14.960 align:start position:0%
also the
 
00:33:16.870 --> 00:33:16.880 align:start position:0%
10 days
 
00:33:18.070 --> 00:33:18.080 align:start position:0%
i felt
 
00:33:18.080 --> 00:33:19.430 align:start position:0%
i felt
was

00:33:19.430 --> 00:33:19.440 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:33:19.440 --> 00:33:22.470 align:start position:0%
was
just

00:33:22.470 --> 00:33:22.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:24.389 --> 00:33:24.399 align:start position:0%
it was just a number pulled out of a hat
 
00:33:25.909 --> 00:33:25.919 align:start position:0%
because there are some
 
00:33:28.070 --> 00:33:28.080 align:start position:0%
things that can affect
 
00:33:30.230 --> 00:33:30.240 align:start position:0%
a community that lasts a lot longer than
 
00:33:33.190 --> 00:33:33.200 align:start position:0%
10 days and i cited coliform
 
00:33:36.950 --> 00:33:36.960 align:start position:0%
contamination of public water and also
 
00:33:39.509 --> 00:33:39.519 align:start position:0%
uh cyanobacteria blooms
 
00:33:42.789 --> 00:33:42.799 align:start position:0%
and i but i i do agree with um
 
00:33:44.870 --> 00:33:44.880 align:start position:0%
representatives davis's thing i don't
 
00:33:46.710 --> 00:33:46.720 align:start position:0%
even though i support the amendment i
 
00:33:48.470 --> 00:33:48.480 align:start position:0%
don't really see how it differs much
 
00:33:50.950 --> 00:33:50.960 align:start position:0%
from the uh statute
 
00:33:53.509 --> 00:33:53.519 align:start position:0%
i think nuisances i mean there are some
 
00:33:55.750 --> 00:33:55.760 align:start position:0%
examples given but
 
00:33:56.630 --> 00:33:56.640 align:start position:0%
i think
 
00:33:59.830 --> 00:33:59.840 align:start position:0%
nuisance could apply to a lot of things
 
00:34:02.630 --> 00:34:02.640 align:start position:0%
um that are already covered
 
00:34:04.389 --> 00:34:04.399 align:start position:0%
you know that i think the the sponsor is
 
00:34:07.190 --> 00:34:07.200 align:start position:0%
trying to narrow down but i still think
 
00:34:09.430 --> 00:34:09.440 align:start position:0%
having the word nuisance in
 
00:34:11.430 --> 00:34:11.440 align:start position:0%
makes this equivalent to the original
 
00:34:13.750 --> 00:34:13.760 align:start position:0%
bill but i will support the amendment
 
00:34:14.629 --> 00:34:14.639 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:34:16.470 --> 00:34:16.480 align:start position:0%
any other
 
00:34:21.750 --> 00:34:21.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:23.909 --> 00:34:23.919 align:start position:0%
okay this is a little confusing so i
 
00:34:26.069 --> 00:34:26.079 align:start position:0%
just i'm going to try to go slow to make
 
00:34:27.829 --> 00:34:27.839 align:start position:0%
sure everybody's following us including
 
00:34:27.839 --> 00:34:29.669 align:start position:0%
sure everybody's following us including
me

00:34:29.669 --> 00:34:29.679 align:start position:0%
me
 
00:34:33.190 --> 00:34:33.200 align:start position:0%
we have in front of us house bill 1272
 
00:34:35.909 --> 00:34:35.919 align:start position:0%
we've taken a vote to reconsider it
 
00:34:38.389 --> 00:34:38.399 align:start position:0%
and now at this point it's it's clear
 
00:34:40.629 --> 00:34:40.639 align:start position:0%
that there is an amendment that needs to
 
00:34:42.310 --> 00:34:42.320 align:start position:0%
be offered
 
00:34:46.230 --> 00:34:46.240 align:start position:0%
and once that's been offered then we'll
 
00:34:47.909 --> 00:34:47.919 align:start position:0%
we'll look what next step it is
 
00:34:50.389 --> 00:34:50.399 align:start position:0%
depending on how the the amendment is
 
00:34:53.669 --> 00:34:53.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:56.230 --> 00:34:56.240 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
00:34:59.750 --> 00:34:59.760 align:start position:0%
we did we we do have uh
 
00:35:03.750 --> 00:35:03.760 align:start position:0%

vote on the amendment
 
00:42:14.790 --> 00:42:14.800 align:start position:0%
that's been proposed
 
00:42:29.109 --> 00:42:29.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:31.430 --> 00:42:31.440 align:start position:0%
out available of the city and including
 
00:42:33.910 --> 00:42:33.920 align:start position:0%
enjoyment of property please explain
 
00:42:36.069 --> 00:42:36.079 align:start position:0%
those two definitions to me i would ask
 
00:42:38.390 --> 00:42:38.400 align:start position:0%
for that but i won't get it so i will
 
00:42:40.470 --> 00:42:40.480 align:start position:0%
say that this does nothing to improve it
 
00:42:41.670 --> 00:42:41.680 align:start position:0%
it keeps it
 
00:42:43.589 --> 00:42:43.599 align:start position:0%
benign to say the least and i will vote
 
00:42:44.630 --> 00:42:44.640 align:start position:0%
for it
 
00:42:47.190 --> 00:42:47.200 align:start position:0%
okay yes
 
00:42:49.910 --> 00:42:49.920 align:start position:0%
everything else save us
 
00:42:51.750 --> 00:42:51.760 align:start position:0%
i would second the comments of my
 
00:42:53.990 --> 00:42:54.000 align:start position:0%
colleague representative majori
 
00:42:56.230 --> 00:42:56.240 align:start position:0%
and i would also ask a question i know
 
00:42:58.470 --> 00:42:58.480 align:start position:0%
i'm not going to get an answer just what
 
00:43:01.430 --> 00:43:01.440 align:start position:0%
is repugnant to the constitution
 
00:43:03.430 --> 00:43:03.440 align:start position:0%
can you provide me with a list of things
 
00:43:12.950 --> 00:43:12.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:16.150 --> 00:43:16.160 align:start position:0%
before you answer that that i think uh
 
00:43:18.069 --> 00:43:18.079 align:start position:0%
research will show that that's current
 
00:43:21.910 --> 00:43:21.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:21.920 --> 00:43:23.750 align:start position:0%
 
yes

00:43:23.750 --> 00:43:23.760 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:43:28.230 --> 00:43:28.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:31.750 --> 00:43:31.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:35.430 --> 00:43:35.440 align:start position:0%
the definition of the word repugnant
 
00:43:38.309 --> 00:43:38.319 align:start position:0%
i will i recall
 
00:43:41.430 --> 00:43:41.440 align:start position:0%
when there was a discussion in congress
 
00:43:42.790 --> 00:43:42.800 align:start position:0%
of the
 
00:43:45.430 --> 00:43:45.440 align:start position:0%
subject of pornography
 
00:43:45.440 --> 00:43:46.470 align:start position:0%
subject of pornography
the

00:43:46.470 --> 00:43:46.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:43:48.790 --> 00:43:48.800 align:start position:0%
esteemed senator
 
00:43:50.550 --> 00:43:50.560 align:start position:0%
suggested that he didn't have a
 
00:43:53.349 --> 00:43:53.359 align:start position:0%
definition of it but he knew it when he
 
00:43:58.630 --> 00:43:58.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:00.390 --> 00:44:00.400 align:start position:0%
how's that
 
00:44:04.309 --> 00:44:04.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:07.750 --> 00:44:07.760 align:start position:0%
uh yes representative clee
 
00:44:10.710 --> 00:44:10.720 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um i guess
 
00:44:12.630 --> 00:44:12.640 align:start position:0%
i have some concerns and worries that
 
00:44:14.309 --> 00:44:14.319 align:start position:0%
we're um
 
00:44:15.589 --> 00:44:15.599 align:start position:0%
truly tying the hands of our
 
00:44:15.599 --> 00:44:17.990 align:start position:0%
truly tying the hands of our
municipalities

00:44:17.990 --> 00:44:18.000 align:start position:0%
municipalities
 
00:44:20.150 --> 00:44:20.160 align:start position:0%
one of the questions that i asked when
 
00:44:23.030 --> 00:44:23.040 align:start position:0%
this originally came up was um
 
00:44:25.349 --> 00:44:25.359 align:start position:0%
if we were to pass this and some type of
 
00:44:27.829 --> 00:44:27.839 align:start position:0%
emergency were to happen
 
00:44:31.430 --> 00:44:31.440 align:start position:0%
that um the municipality would need to
 
00:44:33.510 --> 00:44:33.520 align:start position:0%
be able to do that we would have to get
 
00:44:36.630 --> 00:44:36.640 align:start position:0%
more or less permission from those that
 
00:44:36.640 --> 00:44:37.510 align:start position:0%
more or less permission from those that
were

00:44:37.510 --> 00:44:37.520 align:start position:0%
were
 
00:44:39.589 --> 00:44:39.599 align:start position:0%
currently in office meaning the house
 
00:44:42.550 --> 00:44:42.560 align:start position:0%
and the senate collectively and i asked
 
00:44:44.309 --> 00:44:44.319 align:start position:0%
very specifically if something like this
 
00:44:46.230 --> 00:44:46.240 align:start position:0%
were to happen in november
 
00:44:49.190 --> 00:44:49.200 align:start position:0%
when we're technically not in session
 
00:44:51.430 --> 00:44:51.440 align:start position:0%
would we have to call them
 
00:44:53.349 --> 00:44:53.359 align:start position:0%
in in order to be able to take care of
 
00:44:55.270 --> 00:44:55.280 align:start position:0%
this emergency
 
00:44:57.270 --> 00:44:57.280 align:start position:0%
which is why the well-being of the city
 
00:44:59.910 --> 00:44:59.920 align:start position:0%
was put in and i believe the author very
 
00:45:01.670 --> 00:45:01.680 align:start position:0%
specifically said to me
 
00:45:03.109 --> 00:45:03.119 align:start position:0%
we would never
 
00:45:05.109 --> 00:45:05.119 align:start position:0%
call them in
 
00:45:07.589 --> 00:45:07.599 align:start position:0%
which truly concerned me
 
00:45:08.870 --> 00:45:08.880 align:start position:0%
basically we would be letting our
 
00:45:11.510 --> 00:45:11.520 align:start position:0%
municipalities kind of hang out to dry
 
00:45:13.589 --> 00:45:13.599 align:start position:0%
and i just don't think it and i think
 
00:45:15.990 --> 00:45:16.000 align:start position:0%
that the authors that originally put
 
00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:17.030 align:start position:0%
that the authors that originally put
this

00:45:17.030 --> 00:45:17.040 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:45:17.040 --> 00:45:18.390 align:start position:0%
this
rsa

00:45:18.390 --> 00:45:18.400 align:start position:0%
rsa
 
00:45:20.150 --> 00:45:20.160 align:start position:0%
rsa through
 
00:45:22.230 --> 00:45:22.240 align:start position:0%
specifically put that statement which
 
00:45:24.069 --> 00:45:24.079 align:start position:0%
may seem for the well-being of the city
 
00:45:27.190 --> 00:45:27.200 align:start position:0%
because they knew it would be impossible
 
00:45:29.670 --> 00:45:29.680 align:start position:0%
to think of every type of situation that
 
00:45:30.710 --> 00:45:30.720 align:start position:0%
could happen
 
00:45:33.349 --> 00:45:33.359 align:start position:0%
and i'm concerned that by being specific
 
00:45:35.109 --> 00:45:35.119 align:start position:0%
as we are by basically saying
 
00:45:37.589 --> 00:45:37.599 align:start position:0%
only for the enjoyment of your property
 
00:45:39.349 --> 00:45:39.359 align:start position:0%
we're not taking actually into the
 
00:45:39.359 --> 00:45:40.470 align:start position:0%
we're not taking actually into the
health

00:45:40.470 --> 00:45:40.480 align:start position:0%
health
 
00:45:43.910 --> 00:45:43.920 align:start position:0%
of our citizens and i think that um
 
00:45:45.510 --> 00:45:45.520 align:start position:0%
this is just a bad precedent we're
 
00:45:47.990 --> 00:45:48.000 align:start position:0%
setting i'm very concerned what we're
 
00:45:49.910 --> 00:45:49.920 align:start position:0%
doing to our cities um and for this
 
00:45:53.430 --> 00:45:53.440 align:start position:0%
reason i i will not be voting for this i
 
00:45:54.950 --> 00:45:54.960 align:start position:0%
would i tell this bill thank you
 
00:45:57.430 --> 00:45:57.440 align:start position:0%
representatives davis
 
00:45:59.270 --> 00:45:59.280 align:start position:0%
yeah my
 
00:46:01.270 --> 00:46:01.280 align:start position:0%
sorry i was god to that representative
 
00:46:01.280 --> 00:46:03.190 align:start position:0%

gallagher

00:46:03.190 --> 00:46:03.200 align:start position:0%
gallagher
 
00:46:03.200 --> 00:46:04.150 align:start position:0%
gallagher
um

00:46:04.150 --> 00:46:04.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:05.510 --> 00:46:05.520 align:start position:0%
yeah i
 
00:46:07.990 --> 00:46:08.000 align:start position:0%
want to echo representative clee's
 
00:46:10.950 --> 00:46:10.960 align:start position:0%
comments um i think the amendment makes
 
00:46:12.950 --> 00:46:12.960 align:start position:0%
the bill worse
 
00:46:15.510 --> 00:46:15.520 align:start position:0%
i think enjoyment of property
 
00:46:15.520 --> 00:46:17.270 align:start position:0%
i think enjoyment of property
is

00:46:17.270 --> 00:46:17.280 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:46:19.349 --> 00:46:19.359 align:start position:0%
not something we should be prioritizing
 
00:46:21.829 --> 00:46:21.839 align:start position:0%
over the well-being of the city and so
 
00:46:25.670 --> 00:46:25.680 align:start position:0%
i'll be voting against the amendment too
 
00:46:27.670 --> 00:46:27.680 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:46:30.390 --> 00:46:30.400 align:start position:0%
yes representative ron
 
00:46:32.390 --> 00:46:32.400 align:start position:0%
i guess um i
 
00:46:34.870 --> 00:46:34.880 align:start position:0%
like the amendment better than the bill
 
00:46:36.390 --> 00:46:36.400 align:start position:0%
and i'm also
 
00:46:39.270 --> 00:46:39.280 align:start position:0%
i guess it's up for interpretation but i
 
00:46:40.950 --> 00:46:40.960 align:start position:0%
would consider
 
00:46:42.390 --> 00:46:42.400 align:start position:0%
getting very sick
 
00:46:44.950 --> 00:46:44.960 align:start position:0%
possibly dying to be a nuisance that
 
00:46:47.670 --> 00:46:47.680 align:start position:0%
would prohibit me from or interfere with
 
00:46:50.150 --> 00:46:50.160 align:start position:0%
my use and enjoyment of property so i'm
 
00:46:51.990 --> 00:46:52.000 align:start position:0%
going to support this because getting
 
00:46:54.550 --> 00:46:54.560 align:start position:0%
sick is definitely a nuisance
 
00:46:57.270 --> 00:46:57.280 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative gilman
 
00:46:59.349 --> 00:46:59.359 align:start position:0%

excuse me
 
00:47:11.190 --> 00:47:11.200 align:start position:0%
uh line 19 and 20
 
00:47:13.670 --> 00:47:13.680 align:start position:0%
any ordinance shall be in effect uh from
 
00:47:15.910 --> 00:47:15.920 align:start position:0%

and any other authority is not defined

select board
 
00:50:30.230 --> 00:50:30.240 align:start position:0%
it's going to be a challenge for our

council and costly for our council
 
00:50:35.829 --> 00:50:35.839 align:start position:0%

out
 
00:50:39.109 --> 00:50:39.119 align:start position:0%
how to define
 
00:50:41.510 --> 00:50:41.520 align:start position:0%
what the enjoyment of the property is
 
00:50:43.670 --> 00:50:43.680 align:start position:0%
i i cannot imagine what your legal costs
 
00:50:46.150 --> 00:50:46.160 align:start position:0%
are going to be to defend that i cannot
 
00:50:48.790 --> 00:50:48.800 align:start position:0%
imagine how many different uh uh

00:51:07.829 --> 00:51:07.839 align:start position:0%
who sets not on a select board but on an
 
00:51:09.990 --> 00:51:10.000 align:start position:0%
all dramatic board
 
00:51:11.510 --> 00:51:11.520 align:start position:0%
i can tell you that
 
00:51:13.829 --> 00:51:13.839 align:start position:0%
many lawsuits are brought forward when
 
00:51:15.670 --> 00:51:15.680 align:start position:0%
citizens are not happy with something
 
00:51:17.510 --> 00:51:17.520 align:start position:0%
that we've done
 
00:51:17.520 --> 00:51:18.710 align:start position:0%

00:51:20.870 --> 00:51:20.880 align:start position:0%
whether i think we would lose win or
 
00:51:22.390 --> 00:51:22.400 align:start position:0%
lose i think this is just going to
 
00:51:24.230 --> 00:51:24.240 align:start position:0%
create more chaos
 
00:51:24.240 --> 00:51:24.950 align:start position:0%
create more chaos
in

um at the beginning of the meeting i i

handed out a um
 
01:06:30.309 --> 01:06:30.319 align:start position:0%
a document which is a um
 
01:06:33.750 --> 01:06:33.760 align:start position:0%
a supreme court um ruling
 
01:06:37.750 --> 01:06:37.760 align:start position:0%
um for a citizen of nashua versus um
 
01:06:40.230 --> 01:06:40.240 align:start position:0%
yeah versus the city of nashua as well
 
01:06:41.510 --> 01:06:41.520 align:start position:0%
as a um
 
01:06:45.430 --> 01:06:45.440 align:start position:0%
at that point i believe he was a um
 
01:06:49.349 --> 01:06:49.359 align:start position:0%
an alderman at the time versus um the
 
01:06:52.069 --> 01:06:52.079 align:start position:0%
the city of uh nashua or specifically
 
01:06:53.270 --> 01:06:53.280 align:start position:0%
the mayor
 
01:06:54.549 --> 01:06:54.559 align:start position:0%
of nashua
 
01:06:57.270 --> 01:06:57.280 align:start position:0%
um and i'd like to bring you to page 10
 
01:06:59.029 --> 01:06:59.039 align:start position:0%
of that document one of the
 
01:07:00.549 --> 01:07:00.559 align:start position:0%
conversations that we've had and the
 
01:07:02.150 --> 01:07:02.160 align:start position:0%
reason for this
 
01:07:04.150 --> 01:07:04.160 align:start position:0%
bill to come forward was that
 
01:07:07.510 --> 01:07:07.520 align:start position:0%
nashua and nashua alone does not have an
 
01:07:09.990 --> 01:07:10.000 align:start position:0%
override provision so if you look down
 
01:07:12.950 --> 01:07:12.960 align:start position:0%
towards the bottom of that page
 
01:07:14.870 --> 01:07:14.880 align:start position:0%
you will see
 
01:07:16.390 --> 01:07:16.400 align:start position:0%
item number two whether the city
 
01:07:18.309 --> 01:07:18.319 align:start position:0%
spending cap contains an override
 
01:07:18.319 --> 01:07:19.349 align:start position:0%
spending cap contains an override

01:07:19.349 --> 01:07:19.359 align:start position:0%

01:07:22.309 --> 01:07:22.319 align:start position:0%
the court the court very clearly says
 
01:07:23.750 --> 01:07:23.760 align:start position:0%
we agree with the trial this is the
 
01:07:25.910 --> 01:07:25.920 align:start position:0%
supreme court we agree with the trial
 
01:07:27.910 --> 01:07:27.920 align:start position:0%
court that the city spending cap does
 
01:07:30.309 --> 01:07:30.319 align:start position:0%
not contain an override provision

provision by which a super majority of
 
01:07:56.470 --> 01:07:56.480 align:start position:0%
the pertinent body

may exceed the spending cap
 
01:08:01.270 --> 01:08:01.280 align:start position:0%
if you continue on you'll say that the
 
01:08:03.510 --> 01:08:03.520 align:start position:0%
sim the the limit on the annual increase
 
01:08:04.789 --> 01:08:04.799 align:start position:0%

01:08:34.239 --> 01:08:35.669 align:start position:0%
 
yes

01:08:35.669 --> 01:08:35.679 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:08:38.709 --> 01:08:38.719 align:start position:0%
in arguing for a contrary result t-bone
 
01:08:41.669 --> 01:08:41.679 align:start position:0%
observes that at trial the city's
 
01:08:44.390 --> 01:08:44.400 align:start position:0%
current mayor who also is mayor in the
 
01:08:47.269 --> 01:08:47.279 align:start position:0%
1980s referred to the provision allowing
 
01:08:49.990 --> 01:08:50.000 align:start position:0%
the board to accept certain expenditures
 
01:08:52.709 --> 01:08:52.719 align:start position:0%
from the the spending cap as an override
 
01:08:52.719 --> 01:08:53.990 align:start position:0%
from the the spending cap as an override
provision

01:08:53.990 --> 01:08:54.000 align:start position:0%
provision
 
01:08:55.829 --> 01:08:55.839 align:start position:0%
the mayor's subjective belief that the
 
01:08:57.590 --> 01:08:57.600 align:start position:0%
city spending cap contains an overripe
 
01:09:00.149 --> 01:09:00.159 align:start position:0%
prohibition is irrelevant
 
01:09:02.950 --> 01:09:02.960 align:start position:0%
to our statutory interpretation
 
01:09:06.470 --> 01:09:06.480 align:start position:0%
nashua does not have a spending cap and
 
01:09:08.149 --> 01:09:08.159 align:start position:0%
as such
 
01:09:10.229 --> 01:09:10.239 align:start position:0%
it's been told over and over again
 
01:09:12.950 --> 01:09:12.960 align:start position:0%
everyone has an override everyone does
 
01:09:15.269 --> 01:09:15.279 align:start position:0%
not have an override nashua does not
 
01:09:17.430 --> 01:09:17.440 align:start position:0%
have this override
 
01:09:20.149 --> 01:09:20.159 align:start position:0%
this would mean that we would be limited
 
01:09:22.390 --> 01:09:22.400 align:start position:0%
and unable even with the super majority
 
01:09:24.950 --> 01:09:24.960 align:start position:0%
to be able to do that
 
01:09:27.829 --> 01:09:27.839 align:start position:0%
because of this ruling it is my belief
 
01:09:29.349 --> 01:09:29.359 align:start position:0%
that the original legislation that was
 
01:09:30.709 --> 01:09:30.719 align:start position:0%
brought through last year was brought
 
01:09:32.789 --> 01:09:32.799 align:start position:0%
through as such to override
 
01:09:32.799 --> 01:09:34.470 align:start position:0%
through as such to override
the

01:09:34.470 --> 01:09:34.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:09:37.510 --> 01:09:37.520 align:start position:0%
the judicial ruling on this particular
 
01:09:40.789 --> 01:09:40.799 align:start position:0%
thing i'm not asking to overturn
 
01:09:42.630 --> 01:09:42.640 align:start position:0%
last year's ruling
 
01:09:44.229 --> 01:09:44.239 align:start position:0%
by the esteemed senator who brought it
 
01:09:44.239 --> 01:09:45.269 align:start position:0%
by the esteemed senator who brought it
forward

01:09:45.269 --> 01:09:45.279 align:start position:0%
forward
 
01:09:47.349 --> 01:09:47.359 align:start position:0%
i'm just asking that we
 
01:09:47.359 --> 01:09:49.189 align:start position:0%
i'm just asking that we
consider

01:09:49.189 --> 01:09:49.199 align:start position:0%
consider
 
01:09:51.189 --> 01:09:51.199 align:start position:0%
providing in there that an
 
01:09:53.749 --> 01:09:53.759 align:start position:0%
override feature would be able to happen
 
01:09:56.149 --> 01:09:56.159 align:start position:0%
i'm going to be honest with you
 
01:09:58.950 --> 01:09:58.960 align:start position:0%
i'm still not sure even with this
 
01:10:01.189 --> 01:10:01.199 align:start position:0%
that um it couldn't still be challenged
 
01:10:02.390 --> 01:10:02.400 align:start position:0%
in court
 
01:10:06.550 --> 01:10:06.560 align:start position:0%
but i did ask or i believe that the um
 
01:10:08.630 --> 01:10:08.640 align:start position:0%
the author of this did ask
 
01:10:11.189 --> 01:10:11.199 align:start position:0%
that this feature be put in
 
01:10:13.830 --> 01:10:13.840 align:start position:0%
and that very specifically state a
 
01:10:16.229 --> 01:10:16.239 align:start position:0%
two-thirds majority of the governing
 
01:10:18.950 --> 01:10:18.960 align:start position:0%
body would have to approve that
 
01:10:20.870 --> 01:10:20.880 align:start position:0%
i think that is what the intent was with
 
01:10:23.030 --> 01:10:23.040 align:start position:0%
the original one i'm not asking for an
 
01:10:26.149 --> 01:10:26.159 align:start position:0%
overturn of that spending cap it's done
 
01:10:28.870 --> 01:10:28.880 align:start position:0%
um truth be told i lived in nashua at
 
01:10:30.790 --> 01:10:30.800 align:start position:0%
the time that this went through
 
01:10:32.390 --> 01:10:32.400 align:start position:0%
more than likely i don't remember that
 
01:10:34.310 --> 01:10:34.320 align:start position:0%
many years ago and sometimes i barely
 
01:10:36.470 --> 01:10:36.480 align:start position:0%
remember tomorrow yesterday
 
01:10:36.480 --> 01:10:37.590 align:start position:0%
remember tomorrow yesterday
um

01:10:37.590 --> 01:10:37.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:10:39.830 --> 01:10:39.840 align:start position:0%
but i do believe that i probably voted
 
01:10:41.990 --> 01:10:42.000 align:start position:0%
for it because anybody who would come to
 
01:10:44.310 --> 01:10:44.320 align:start position:0%
me and say to me
 
01:10:46.390 --> 01:10:46.400 align:start position:0%
by stopping spending i can save you
 
01:10:49.110 --> 01:10:49.120 align:start position:0%
taxes who in their right mind would not
 
01:10:50.630 --> 01:10:50.640 align:start position:0%
say yes
 
01:10:51.910 --> 01:10:51.920 align:start position:0%
i don't want to think of myself as
 
01:10:55.189 --> 01:10:55.199 align:start position:0%
uneducated but i think the truth is i
 
01:10:58.870 --> 01:10:58.880 align:start position:0%
didn't look at what the possible
 
01:11:00.870 --> 01:11:00.880 align:start position:0%
issues could be we often refer to them
 
01:11:03.430 --> 01:11:03.440 align:start position:0%
here as unintended consequences
 
01:11:06.310 --> 01:11:06.320 align:start position:0%
and as such because i did not
 
01:11:09.030 --> 01:11:09.040 align:start position:0%
consider those things nashua has had
 
01:11:11.270 --> 01:11:11.280 align:start position:0%
some unintended consequences
 
01:11:13.350 --> 01:11:13.360 align:start position:0%
i do believe over the years nashua did
 
01:11:13.360 --> 01:11:14.550 align:start position:0%
i do believe over the years nashua did
violate

01:11:14.550 --> 01:11:14.560 align:start position:0%
violate
 
01:11:16.229 --> 01:11:16.239 align:start position:0%
the no override
 
01:11:18.229 --> 01:11:18.239 align:start position:0%
and i think out of desperation
 
01:11:19.910 --> 01:11:19.920 align:start position:0%
that they moved certain monies into
 
01:11:22.709 --> 01:11:22.719 align:start position:0%
certain areas and so on to try to
 
01:11:24.870 --> 01:11:24.880 align:start position:0%
override it in a different manner
 
01:11:26.550 --> 01:11:26.560 align:start position:0%
i don't want to see this happen i want
 
01:11:28.550 --> 01:11:28.560 align:start position:0%
to see full transparency
 
01:11:29.990 --> 01:11:30.000 align:start position:0%
and that's why this bill was brought
 
01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:31.430 align:start position:0%
and that's why this bill was brought
forward

01:11:31.430 --> 01:11:31.440 align:start position:0%
forward
 
01:11:33.590 --> 01:11:33.600 align:start position:0%
i think at this point if there any real
 
01:11:35.669 --> 01:11:35.679 align:start position:0%
flaws in it um
 
01:11:35.679 --> 01:11:36.709 align:start position:0%
flaws in it um
i

01:11:36.709 --> 01:11:36.719 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:11:38.630 --> 01:11:38.640 align:start position:0%
truth be told i don't think it'll pass
 
01:11:38.640 --> 01:11:39.750 align:start position:0%
truth be told i don't think it'll pass
this

01:11:39.750 --> 01:11:39.760 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:11:41.430 --> 01:11:41.440 align:start position:0%
committee let alone the
 
01:11:42.630 --> 01:11:42.640 align:start position:0%
the house
 
01:11:45.110 --> 01:11:45.120 align:start position:0%
which truly saddens me because i think
 
01:11:47.510 --> 01:11:47.520 align:start position:0%
the the original bill was targeted at
 
01:11:49.750 --> 01:11:49.760 align:start position:0%
nashua and i think the unintended
 
01:11:51.910 --> 01:11:51.920 align:start position:0%
consequences is we're going to hurt my
 
01:11:51.920 --> 01:11:52.870 align:start position:0%
consequences is we're going to hurt my
city

01:11:52.870 --> 01:11:52.880 align:start position:0%
city
 
01:11:54.630 --> 01:11:54.640 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:11:55.830 --> 01:11:55.840 align:start position:0%
i'll leave it at that thank you very
 
01:11:55.840 --> 01:11:56.790 align:start position:0%
i'll leave it at that thank you very
much

01:11:56.790 --> 01:11:56.800 align:start position:0%
much
 
01:11:58.310 --> 01:11:58.320 align:start position:0%
thank you representative is there
 
01:12:01.110 --> 01:12:01.120 align:start position:0%
further discussion yes representative
 
01:12:03.750 --> 01:12:03.760 align:start position:0%
mr chair um may i ask a question of the
 
01:12:06.870 --> 01:12:06.880 align:start position:0%
representative from nashua yes if you're
 
01:12:08.390 --> 01:12:08.400 align:start position:0%
willing to take the question yes i am
 
01:12:08.400 --> 01:12:10.470 align:start position:0%
willing to take the question yes i am
representative

01:12:10.470 --> 01:12:10.480 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:12:11.910 --> 01:12:11.920 align:start position:0%
if there if you do not have the
 
01:12:13.990 --> 01:12:14.000 align:start position:0%
two-thirds super majority to override is
 
01:12:17.350 --> 01:12:17.360 align:start position:0%
it a simple majority now to override
 
01:12:19.669 --> 01:12:19.679 align:start position:0%
technically speaking we don't have it in
 
01:12:21.590 --> 01:12:21.600 align:start position:0%
the past what we have done when they
 
01:12:22.790 --> 01:12:22.800 align:start position:0%
have done
 
01:12:25.430 --> 01:12:25.440 align:start position:0%
this pseudo override it's been always a
 
01:12:27.830 --> 01:12:27.840 align:start position:0%
two-thirds majority they never once did
 
01:12:30.310 --> 01:12:30.320 align:start position:0%
a simple majority um and i don't think
 
01:12:30.320 --> 01:12:31.270 align:start position:0%
a simple majority um and i don't think
that

01:12:31.270 --> 01:12:31.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:12:33.030 --> 01:12:33.040 align:start position:0%
allowing a simple majority in this case
 
01:12:35.110 --> 01:12:35.120 align:start position:0%
would be acceptable so two-thirds is the
 
01:12:37.669 --> 01:12:37.679 align:start position:0%
only way to do it thank you
 
01:12:40.149 --> 01:12:40.159 align:start position:0%
any further discussion
 
01:12:43.430 --> 01:12:43.440 align:start position:0%
may i ask rep yes representative power
 
01:12:45.510 --> 01:12:45.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um
 
01:12:48.470 --> 01:12:48.480 align:start position:0%
i find this bill very problematic and
 
01:12:50.390 --> 01:12:50.400 align:start position:0%
i'm a little bit confused
 
01:12:53.830 --> 01:12:53.840 align:start position:0%
because in in my mind this bill undoes
 
01:12:56.790 --> 01:12:56.800 align:start position:0%
sb 52 which was signed into law by the
 
01:12:56.800 --> 01:12:57.910 align:start position:0%
sb 52 which was signed into law by the
governor

01:12:57.910 --> 01:12:57.920 align:start position:0%
governor
 
01:12:59.830 --> 01:12:59.840 align:start position:0%
just last summer and the ink wasn't even
 
01:13:02.229 --> 01:13:02.239 align:start position:0%
dry on that signature and this bill was
 
01:13:05.990 --> 01:13:06.000 align:start position:0%
filed to essentially undo everything
 
01:13:08.709 --> 01:13:08.719 align:start position:0%
that's contained contained in sp 52 and
 
01:13:10.790 --> 01:13:10.800 align:start position:0%
that was signed into law so i've heard
 
01:13:13.430 --> 01:13:13.440 align:start position:0%
in this committee comments
 
01:13:15.590 --> 01:13:15.600 align:start position:0%
from some of my colleagues that we
 
01:13:18.790 --> 01:13:18.800 align:start position:0%
should not be undoing bills we need to
 
01:13:21.110 --> 01:13:21.120 align:start position:0%
let them
 
01:13:24.470 --> 01:13:24.480 align:start position:0%
play out try them out and i'm just very
 
01:13:26.310 --> 01:13:26.320 align:start position:0%
confused because
 
01:13:28.709 --> 01:13:28.719 align:start position:0%
those were comments made just yesterday
 
01:13:30.870 --> 01:13:30.880 align:start position:0%
as well as last
 
01:13:34.070 --> 01:13:34.080 align:start position:0%
year in committee with regards to
 
01:13:39.910 --> 01:13:39.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:39.920 --> 01:13:42.149 align:start position:0%
 
representative

01:13:42.149 --> 01:13:42.159 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:13:44.630 --> 01:13:44.640 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for allowing me a second
 
01:13:46.790 --> 01:13:46.800 align:start position:0%
chance at this
 
01:13:49.910 --> 01:13:49.920 align:start position:0%
while i do respect my colleague it i
 
01:13:51.270 --> 01:13:51.280 align:start position:0%
don't believe it was the author's
 
01:13:52.630 --> 01:13:52.640 align:start position:0%
intention to
 
01:13:57.189 --> 01:13:57.199 align:start position:0%
to undo sb 52 um as i said it was put
 
01:13:57.199 --> 01:13:59.110 align:start position:0%
to undo sb 52 um as i said it was put
through

01:13:59.110 --> 01:13:59.120 align:start position:0%
through
 
01:14:01.910 --> 01:14:01.920 align:start position:0%
for whatever the reasons are i i cannot
 
01:14:03.910 --> 01:14:03.920 align:start position:0%
judge a person nor should i um and i
 
01:14:05.830 --> 01:14:05.840 align:start position:0%
apologize because i think my comments
 
01:14:07.030 --> 01:14:07.040 align:start position:0%
prior did
 
01:14:09.510 --> 01:14:09.520 align:start position:0%
uh make a judgment call on it but
 
01:14:12.229 --> 01:14:12.239 align:start position:0%
the main thing here is
 
01:14:15.110 --> 01:14:15.120 align:start position:0%
it would allow for the override function
 
01:14:17.189 --> 01:14:17.199 align:start position:0%
i don't believe it gets rid of the
 
01:14:19.590 --> 01:14:19.600 align:start position:0%
spending cap again
 
01:14:21.750 --> 01:14:21.760 align:start position:0%
i think maybe if this were put into
 
01:14:23.830 --> 01:14:23.840 align:start position:0%
court it could be
 
01:14:26.070 --> 01:14:26.080 align:start position:0%
even as it stands right now
 
01:14:28.229 --> 01:14:28.239 align:start position:0%
we could be looking at another judicial
 
01:14:28.239 --> 01:14:29.590 align:start position:0%
we could be looking at another judicial
um

01:14:29.590 --> 01:14:29.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:14:29.600 --> 01:14:31.430 align:start position:0%
um
exception

01:14:31.430 --> 01:14:31.440 align:start position:0%
exception
 
01:14:31.440 --> 01:14:32.229 align:start position:0%
exception
the

01:14:32.229 --> 01:14:32.239 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:14:32.239 --> 01:14:33.590 align:start position:0%
the
original

01:14:33.590 --> 01:14:33.600 align:start position:0%
original
 
01:14:37.030 --> 01:14:37.040 align:start position:0%
spending cap went to the lower court
 
01:14:40.070 --> 01:14:40.080 align:start position:0%
went to a supreme court
 
01:14:42.470 --> 01:14:42.480 align:start position:0%
the judge very specifically stated there
 
01:14:44.470 --> 01:14:44.480 align:start position:0%
was no override
 
01:14:46.310 --> 01:14:46.320 align:start position:0%
for nashua
 
01:14:47.669 --> 01:14:47.679 align:start position:0%
there was no override provision no
 
01:14:49.030 --> 01:14:49.040 align:start position:0%
matter what
 
01:14:50.870 --> 01:14:50.880 align:start position:0%
basically the body did
 
01:14:52.870 --> 01:14:52.880 align:start position:0%
nor what the
 
01:14:55.110 --> 01:14:55.120 align:start position:0%
mayor wanted to call it
 
01:14:57.910 --> 01:14:57.920 align:start position:0%
having that judgment at this point
 
01:14:57.920 --> 01:14:59.189 align:start position:0%
having that judgment at this point
forward

01:14:59.189 --> 01:14:59.199 align:start position:0%
forward
 
01:15:02.149 --> 01:15:02.159 align:start position:0%
there would be absolutely no ride no way
 
01:15:04.709 --> 01:15:04.719 align:start position:0%
that nashua could misinterpret and say
 
01:15:04.719 --> 01:15:05.590 align:start position:0%
that nashua could misinterpret and say
well

01:15:05.590 --> 01:15:05.600 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:15:07.590 --> 01:15:07.600 align:start position:0%
we're going to create an override that's
 
01:15:09.750 --> 01:15:09.760 align:start position:0%
what this was supposed to do
 
01:15:11.590 --> 01:15:11.600 align:start position:0%
i've spoken to the author of it i've
 
01:15:14.470 --> 01:15:14.480 align:start position:0%
spoken to our legal
 
01:15:17.510 --> 01:15:17.520 align:start position:0%
individuals and so on and it basically
 
01:15:19.910 --> 01:15:19.920 align:start position:0%
the statement of it any such tax cap or
 
01:15:21.590 --> 01:15:21.600 align:start position:0%
spending cap does not contain an
 
01:15:24.550 --> 01:15:24.560 align:start position:0%
override i'm sorry that's page
 
01:15:26.310 --> 01:15:26.320 align:start position:0%
one line
 
01:15:26.320 --> 01:15:27.189 align:start position:0%
one line
seven

01:15:27.189 --> 01:15:27.199 align:start position:0%
seven
 
01:15:29.750 --> 01:15:29.760 align:start position:0%
if any such cap or spending cap does not
 
01:15:31.510 --> 01:15:31.520 align:start position:0%
contain an override provision it shall
 
01:15:33.510 --> 01:15:33.520 align:start position:0%
be interpreted to allow
 
01:15:36.590 --> 01:15:36.600 align:start position:0%
an override upon a two-thirds
 
01:15:38.709 --> 01:15:38.719 align:start position:0%
super-majority vote of the governing
 
01:15:38.719 --> 01:15:39.669 align:start position:0%
super-majority vote of the governing
body

01:15:39.669 --> 01:15:39.679 align:start position:0%
body
 
01:15:41.590 --> 01:15:41.600 align:start position:0%
that was my main
 
01:15:44.870 --> 01:15:44.880 align:start position:0%
concern when this went through
 
01:15:47.270 --> 01:15:47.280 align:start position:0%
you're right the ink was not dry but
 
01:15:49.990 --> 01:15:50.000 align:start position:0%
that was because nor was the ink dried
 
01:15:52.630 --> 01:15:52.640 align:start position:0%
on this legislation from i mean this
 
01:15:55.510 --> 01:15:55.520 align:start position:0%
ruling from 2019 from the superior on
 
01:15:57.189 --> 01:15:57.199 align:start position:0%
the supreme court
 
01:15:57.199 --> 01:15:57.990 align:start position:0%
the supreme court
so

01:15:57.990 --> 01:15:58.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:16:00.470 --> 01:16:00.480 align:start position:0%
that legislation again i'm trying not to
 
01:16:02.310 --> 01:16:02.320 align:start position:0%
make a judgment i believe was in
 
01:16:05.590 --> 01:16:05.600 align:start position:0%
reaction to that supreme court ruling
 
01:16:07.030 --> 01:16:07.040 align:start position:0%
so again
 
01:16:10.470 --> 01:16:10.480 align:start position:0%
no override exists in nashua
 
01:16:11.910 --> 01:16:11.920 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry
 
01:16:14.550 --> 01:16:14.560 align:start position:0%
i'm talking about on page seven let me
 
01:16:17.270 --> 01:16:17.280 align:start position:0%
sorry line seven through line nine the
 
01:16:19.030 --> 01:16:19.040 align:start position:0%
highlighted area
 
01:16:22.390 --> 01:16:22.400 align:start position:0%
no in our in our bill 1342 sir i'm so
 
01:16:24.070 --> 01:16:24.080 align:start position:0%
sorry i'm jumping around too much i
 
01:16:25.590 --> 01:16:25.600 align:start position:0%
apologize for that
 
01:16:27.669 --> 01:16:27.679 align:start position:0%
i i have to admit i am very passionate
 
01:16:28.790 --> 01:16:28.800 align:start position:0%
about this
 
01:16:30.310 --> 01:16:30.320 align:start position:0%
and i'm having anxiety thinking would
 
01:16:31.910 --> 01:16:31.920 align:start position:0%
have to speak on the floor after six
 
01:16:33.590 --> 01:16:33.600 align:start position:0%
years i've never spoken on the floor and
 
01:16:35.110 --> 01:16:35.120 align:start position:0%
i did not want to make this on my first
 
01:16:36.870 --> 01:16:36.880 align:start position:0%
one but
 
01:16:39.350 --> 01:16:39.360 align:start position:0%
so i'm already so my hands are ice cold
 
01:16:41.189 --> 01:16:41.199 align:start position:0%
and i'm already having an anxiety attack
 
01:16:42.390 --> 01:16:42.400 align:start position:0%
about it but
 
01:16:45.910 --> 01:16:45.920 align:start position:0%
i am very passionate about it i saw
 
01:16:48.470 --> 01:16:48.480 align:start position:0%
what not having an override did to the
 
01:16:48.480 --> 01:16:49.510 align:start position:0%
what not having an override did to the
city

01:16:49.510 --> 01:16:49.520 align:start position:0%
city
 
01:16:52.550 --> 01:16:52.560 align:start position:0%
the the streets were falling apart
 
01:16:54.709 --> 01:16:54.719 align:start position:0%
infrastructure was dropping and i think
 
01:16:55.830 --> 01:16:55.840 align:start position:0%
that's why
 
01:16:57.430 --> 01:16:57.440 align:start position:0%
out of sheer
 
01:16:59.590 --> 01:16:59.600 align:start position:0%
frustration and so on
 
01:17:01.910 --> 01:17:01.920 align:start position:0%
they created an override i was not on
 
01:17:03.669 --> 01:17:03.679 align:start position:0%
the board at the time
 
01:17:05.669 --> 01:17:05.679 align:start position:0%
this was basically overturned by the
 
01:17:08.550 --> 01:17:08.560 align:start position:0%
time i soon after i got on the board so
 
01:17:10.630 --> 01:17:10.640 align:start position:0%
thank you and again and i apologize if
 
01:17:10.640 --> 01:17:11.669 align:start position:0%
thank you and again and i apologize if
i'm

01:17:11.669 --> 01:17:11.679 align:start position:0%
i'm
 
01:17:14.870 --> 01:17:14.880 align:start position:0%
appearing to be contradictory um to to
 
01:17:21.990 --> 01:17:22.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:23.910 --> 01:17:23.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair my understanding is
 
01:17:26.149 --> 01:17:26.159 align:start position:0%
that currently every
 
01:17:28.470 --> 01:17:28.480 align:start position:0%
existing tax and spending cap in new
 
01:17:28.480 --> 01:17:30.550 align:start position:0%
existing tax and spending cap in new
hampshire

01:17:30.550 --> 01:17:30.560 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
01:17:32.390 --> 01:17:32.400 align:start position:0%
regardless of whether it was adopted
 
01:17:36.229 --> 01:17:36.239 align:start position:0%
before july 5th 2011 it does
 
01:17:37.270 --> 01:17:37.280 align:start position:0%
it does
 
01:17:40.070 --> 01:17:40.080 align:start position:0%
have a super majority override provision
 
01:17:41.910 --> 01:17:41.920 align:start position:0%
and also
 
01:17:45.430 --> 01:17:45.440 align:start position:0%
sb 52 did in fact re which was signed
 
01:17:47.510 --> 01:17:47.520 align:start position:0%
into law did in fact require that any
 
01:17:50.470 --> 01:17:50.480 align:start position:0%
municipal action that redistributed
 
01:17:53.910 --> 01:17:53.920 align:start position:0%
excludable budget items from within the
 
01:17:55.830 --> 01:17:55.840 align:start position:0%
limit of the cap budget to outside of
 
01:17:58.229 --> 01:17:58.239 align:start position:0%
the budget cap shall require a
 
01:18:00.870 --> 01:18:00.880 align:start position:0%
supermajority vote that was one of the
 
01:18:02.630 --> 01:18:02.640 align:start position:0%
i guess um
 
01:18:04.070 --> 01:18:04.080 align:start position:0%
that was one of the
 
01:18:05.669 --> 01:18:05.679 align:start position:0%
things that that
 
01:18:10.070 --> 01:18:10.080 align:start position:0%
was contained in sb52 and and so i'm i'm
 
01:18:12.229 --> 01:18:12.239 align:start position:0%
i continue to be a little bit confused
 
01:18:12.239 --> 01:18:13.030 align:start position:0%
i continue to be a little bit confused
by

01:18:13.030 --> 01:18:13.040 align:start position:0%
by
 
01:18:13.040 --> 01:18:13.910 align:start position:0%
by
the

01:18:13.910 --> 01:18:13.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:18:19.669 --> 01:18:19.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:22.229 --> 01:18:22.239 align:start position:0%
yes representative tripp
 
01:18:25.350 --> 01:18:25.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:25.360 --> 01:18:26.550 align:start position:0%
 
i uh

01:18:26.550 --> 01:18:26.560 align:start position:0%
i uh
 
01:18:29.270 --> 01:18:29.280 align:start position:0%
believe that uh my understanding of this
 
01:18:32.310 --> 01:18:32.320 align:start position:0%
is that even though nasha was
 
01:18:32.320 --> 01:18:34.390 align:start position:0%
is that even though nasha was
was

01:18:34.390 --> 01:18:34.400 align:start position:0%
was
 
01:18:34.400 --> 01:18:35.910 align:start position:0%
was
very

01:18:35.910 --> 01:18:35.920 align:start position:0%
very
 
01:18:40.550 --> 01:18:40.560 align:start position:0%
succinctly told that they need a
 
01:18:43.830 --> 01:18:43.840 align:start position:0%
a spending cap exclusion
 
01:18:45.350 --> 01:18:45.360 align:start position:0%
or override
 
01:18:46.950 --> 01:18:46.960 align:start position:0%
they they
 
01:18:49.110 --> 01:18:49.120 align:start position:0%
since it requires
 
01:18:49.120 --> 01:18:50.550 align:start position:0%
since it requires
a

01:18:50.550 --> 01:18:50.560 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:18:51.830 --> 01:18:51.840 align:start position:0%
charter change
 
01:18:51.840 --> 01:18:52.950 align:start position:0%
charter change
they

01:18:52.950 --> 01:18:52.960 align:start position:0%
they
 
01:18:55.830 --> 01:18:55.840 align:start position:0%
haven't done it so
 
01:18:58.310 --> 01:18:58.320 align:start position:0%
the action of this bill is to
 
01:19:00.310 --> 01:19:00.320 align:start position:0%
essentially negate
 
01:19:03.189 --> 01:19:03.199 align:start position:0%
that requirement that's found in
 
01:19:07.669 --> 01:19:07.679 align:start position:0%
rsa 49 c12 you know i i don't understand
 
01:19:07.679 --> 01:19:08.470 align:start position:0%
rsa 49 c12 you know i i don't understand
why

01:19:08.470 --> 01:19:08.480 align:start position:0%
why
 
01:19:10.070 --> 01:19:10.080 align:start position:0%
it is that uh
 
01:19:10.080 --> 01:19:11.750 align:start position:0%
it is that uh
nashua

01:19:11.750 --> 01:19:11.760 align:start position:0%
nashua
 
01:19:13.669 --> 01:19:13.679 align:start position:0%
should be given this exclusion that all
 
01:19:16.229 --> 01:19:16.239 align:start position:0%
the other cities and towns have to uh
 
01:19:18.950 --> 01:19:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:21.430 --> 01:19:21.440 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative clio is it
 
01:19:23.350 --> 01:19:23.360 align:start position:0%
any additional information from what you
 
01:19:23.360 --> 01:19:24.630 align:start position:0%
any additional information from what you
provided

01:19:24.630 --> 01:19:24.640 align:start position:0%
provided
 
01:19:26.229 --> 01:19:26.239 align:start position:0%
yes it is but i see that representative
 
01:19:29.350 --> 01:19:29.360 align:start position:0%
gilman go ahead representative
 
01:19:31.590 --> 01:19:31.600 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i wanted to follow up
 
01:19:33.669 --> 01:19:33.679 align:start position:0%
on representative power's comments about
 
01:19:36.790 --> 01:19:36.800 align:start position:0%
the previous bill that was enacted
 
01:19:39.430 --> 01:19:39.440 align:start position:0%
the lines that were struck include
 
01:19:41.910 --> 01:19:41.920 align:start position:0%
principal payments and interest on new
 
01:19:44.470 --> 01:19:44.480 align:start position:0%
miss municipal bonded debt can't be
 
01:19:46.870 --> 01:19:46.880 align:start position:0%
included in the tax cap and counting
 
01:19:49.910 --> 01:19:49.920 align:start position:0%
towards the tax cap and i have a problem
 
01:19:51.669 --> 01:19:51.679 align:start position:0%
with that because
 
01:19:55.110 --> 01:19:55.120 align:start position:0%
um of the bond issue uh the bond issue
 
01:19:57.590 --> 01:19:57.600 align:start position:0%
was agreed but then you can't pay for it
 
01:19:59.350 --> 01:19:59.360 align:start position:0%
the next year
 
01:20:03.110 --> 01:20:03.120 align:start position:0%
for some budgetary reason
 
01:20:04.790 --> 01:20:04.800 align:start position:0%
that the bonding rate of the
 
01:20:08.550 --> 01:20:08.560 align:start position:0%
municipality may go down
 
01:20:11.430 --> 01:20:11.440 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
01:20:11.440 --> 01:20:12.629 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
um

01:20:12.629 --> 01:20:12.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:15.189 --> 01:20:15.199 align:start position:0%
yes uh my it's more of a clarifying to
 
01:20:17.270 --> 01:20:17.280 align:start position:0%
what um representative tripp's uh
 
01:20:18.390 --> 01:20:18.400 align:start position:0%
comment about
 
01:20:20.149 --> 01:20:20.159 align:start position:0%
why should nashville be any different
 
01:20:22.550 --> 01:20:22.560 align:start position:0%
actually right now nashua is
 
01:20:24.870 --> 01:20:24.880 align:start position:0%
the only one that is different
 
01:20:27.830 --> 01:20:27.840 align:start position:0%
all of the municipalities within their
 
01:20:30.229 --> 01:20:30.239 align:start position:0%
tax or spending cap have the override
 
01:20:30.239 --> 01:20:31.430 align:start position:0%
tax or spending cap have the override
feature

01:20:31.430 --> 01:20:31.440 align:start position:0%
feature
 
01:20:33.830 --> 01:20:33.840 align:start position:0%
nashua is the only one who does not have
 
01:20:33.840 --> 01:20:34.709 align:start position:0%
nashua is the only one who does not have
it

01:20:34.709 --> 01:20:34.719 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:20:37.030 --> 01:20:37.040 align:start position:0%
so nashua is being singled out in the
 
01:20:39.510 --> 01:20:39.520 align:start position:0%
fact that they aren't like the rest and
 
01:20:42.870 --> 01:20:42.880 align:start position:0%
we're trying to make us like the rest
 
01:20:46.550 --> 01:20:46.560 align:start position:0%
thank you uh any further comment
 
01:20:48.229 --> 01:20:48.239 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
01:20:51.750 --> 01:20:51.760 align:start position:0%
that was exactly my point uh
 
01:20:53.750 --> 01:20:53.760 align:start position:0%
it seems like the easier thing rather
 
01:20:56.629 --> 01:20:56.639 align:start position:0%
than changing state law would be just
 
01:20:59.030 --> 01:20:59.040 align:start position:0%
for nashua to put a
 
01:21:01.910 --> 01:21:01.920 align:start position:0%
tax cap or spending cap override in
 
01:21:04.070 --> 01:21:04.080 align:start position:0%
their charter rather than you know us
 
01:21:06.629 --> 01:21:06.639 align:start position:0%
going to this
 
01:21:09.430 --> 01:21:09.440 align:start position:0%
thank you uh no i'm not going to take
 
01:21:11.189 --> 01:21:11.199 align:start position:0%
any further discussion on this i'm going
 
01:21:13.350 --> 01:21:13.360 align:start position:0%
to recess this bill
 
01:21:15.350 --> 01:21:15.360 align:start position:0%
and give myself an opportunity to get
 
01:21:15.360 --> 01:21:16.709 align:start position:0%
and give myself an opportunity to get
some

01:21:16.709 --> 01:21:16.719 align:start position:0%
some
 
01:21:19.830 --> 01:21:19.840 align:start position:0%
advice legal advice before we go any
 
01:21:19.840 --> 01:21:20.870 align:start position:0%
advice legal advice before we go any
further

01:21:20.870 --> 01:21:20.880 align:start position:0%
further
 
01:21:20.880 --> 01:21:23.590 align:start position:0%
further

representative powell do you want to

elaborate on your motion yes thank you
 
01:24:29.430 --> 01:24:29.440 align:start position:0%
mr chair
 
01:24:32.229 --> 01:24:32.239 align:start position:0%
this bill is enabling legislation
 
01:24:34.870 --> 01:24:34.880 align:start position:0%
and it provides the voters of a school
 
01:24:37.830 --> 01:24:37.840 align:start position:0%
district with the ability to enact a
 
01:24:39.510 --> 01:24:39.520 align:start position:0%
budget cap
 
01:24:43.510 --> 01:24:43.520 align:start position:0%
that adjusts annually adjusts annually
 
01:24:45.510 --> 01:24:45.520 align:start position:0%
the maximum budget
 
01:24:47.910 --> 01:24:47.920 align:start position:0%
that's based on the number of students
 
01:24:50.709 --> 01:24:50.719 align:start position:0%
which is the average daily membership
 
01:24:53.830 --> 01:24:53.840 align:start position:0%
and it can also have an an annual
 
01:24:55.750 --> 01:24:55.760 align:start position:0%
inflation factor
 
01:24:58.149 --> 01:24:58.159 align:start position:0%
the inflation factor can be a fixed
 
01:25:00.550 --> 01:25:00.560 align:start position:0%
percentage or it can be based on an
 
01:25:02.790 --> 01:25:02.800 align:start position:0%
index from the united states bureau of
 
01:25:05.270 --> 01:25:05.280 align:start position:0%
labor statistics
 
01:25:05.280 --> 01:25:07.030 align:start position:0%
labor statistics
so

01:25:07.030 --> 01:25:07.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:25:08.390 --> 01:25:08.400 align:start position:0%
the school board and the budget
 
01:25:08.400 --> 01:25:10.790 align:start position:0%
the school board and the budget
committee

01:25:10.790 --> 01:25:10.800 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:25:13.189 --> 01:25:13.199 align:start position:0%
needs to manage their their spending
 
01:25:15.030 --> 01:25:15.040 align:start position:0%
within the budget cap
 
01:25:18.149 --> 01:25:18.159 align:start position:0%
and this bill also provides an override
 
01:25:21.990 --> 01:25:22.000 align:start position:0%
in in this in situations in which
 
01:25:25.430 --> 01:25:25.440 align:start position:0%
the legislative body feels that
 
01:25:25.440 --> 01:25:27.189 align:start position:0%
the legislative body feels that
the

01:25:27.189 --> 01:25:27.199 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:25:28.470 --> 01:25:28.480 align:start position:0%
budget cap
 
01:25:30.070 --> 01:25:30.080 align:start position:0%
needs to be
 
01:25:30.080 --> 01:25:32.070 align:start position:0%
needs to be
overwritten

01:25:32.070 --> 01:25:32.080 align:start position:0%
overwritten
 
01:25:32.080 --> 01:25:33.030 align:start position:0%
overwritten
so

01:25:33.030 --> 01:25:33.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:25:35.910 --> 01:25:35.920 align:start position:0%
in my mind this bill provides tools for
 
01:25:39.750 --> 01:25:39.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:42.870 --> 01:25:42.880 align:start position:0%
what i see as unsustainable budgets that
 
01:25:45.510 --> 01:25:45.520 align:start position:0%
increase year after year despite the
 
01:25:48.229 --> 01:25:48.239 align:start position:0%
student enrollment going down
 
01:25:50.390 --> 01:25:50.400 align:start position:0%
and the last comment that i'll make is
 
01:25:53.030 --> 01:25:53.040 align:start position:0%
we can we constantly and continually
 
01:25:56.229 --> 01:25:56.239 align:start position:0%
hear about the affordability of
 
01:25:58.950 --> 01:25:58.960 align:start position:0%
to be able to live in new hampshire and
 
01:26:01.510 --> 01:26:01.520 align:start position:0%
i would submit to you that part of this
 
01:26:04.070 --> 01:26:04.080 align:start position:0%
has to do with our taxation
 
01:26:05.750 --> 01:26:05.760 align:start position:0%
and our spending
 
01:26:09.350 --> 01:26:09.360 align:start position:0%
so i think that with you know
 
01:26:11.669 --> 01:26:11.679 align:start position:0%
to to that end
 
01:26:14.470 --> 01:26:14.480 align:start position:0%
controlling our spending
 
01:26:18.470 --> 01:26:18.480 align:start position:0%
in turn controls the taxes which in turn
 
01:26:20.709 --> 01:26:20.719 align:start position:0%
makes new hampshire more affordable to
 
01:26:20.719 --> 01:26:23.350 align:start position:0%
makes new hampshire more affordable to
live

01:26:23.350 --> 01:26:23.360 align:start position:0%
live
 
01:26:23.360 --> 01:26:25.430 align:start position:0%
live
okay

01:26:25.430 --> 01:26:25.440 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:26:34.629 --> 01:26:34.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:36.950 --> 01:26:36.960 align:start position:0%
go ahead representative
 
01:26:38.950 --> 01:26:38.960 align:start position:0%

01:26:38.960 --> 01:26:40.149 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair

01:26:40.149 --> 01:26:40.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:26:42.390 --> 01:26:42.400 align:start position:0%
the statement has been made
 
01:26:45.350 --> 01:26:45.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:47.590 --> 01:26:47.600 align:start position:0%
is this better yeah statement has been
 
01:26:49.669 --> 01:26:49.679 align:start position:0%
made that uh
 
01:26:52.390 --> 01:26:52.400 align:start position:0%
unsustainable spending and
 
01:26:54.470 --> 01:26:54.480 align:start position:0%
school districts and other bodies
 
01:26:56.229 --> 01:26:56.239 align:start position:0%
needing to be accountable for their
 
01:26:56.239 --> 01:26:57.350 align:start position:0%
needing to be accountable for their
budgets

01:26:57.350 --> 01:26:57.360 align:start position:0%
budgets
 
01:26:59.910 --> 01:26:59.920 align:start position:0%
which certainly is laudable
 
01:27:01.750 --> 01:27:01.760 align:start position:0%
but what about education freedom
 
01:27:04.709 --> 01:27:04.719 align:start position:0%
accounts the house just voted that
 
01:27:07.030 --> 01:27:07.040 align:start position:0%
they do not need to be accountable to
 
01:27:09.430 --> 01:27:09.440 align:start position:0%
any agency for their budget
 
01:27:11.430 --> 01:27:11.440 align:start position:0%
what is the
 
01:27:11.440 --> 01:27:12.390 align:start position:0%
what is the
logic

01:27:12.390 --> 01:27:12.400 align:start position:0%
logic
 
01:27:15.270 --> 01:27:15.280 align:start position:0%
behind making school boards
 
01:27:17.189 --> 01:27:17.199 align:start position:0%
live within these constraints but
 
01:27:20.709 --> 01:27:20.719 align:start position:0%
allowing education freedom accounts to
 
01:27:27.189 --> 01:27:27.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:30.470 --> 01:27:30.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:32.950 --> 01:27:32.960 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i i just had a couple
 
01:27:35.990 --> 01:27:36.000 align:start position:0%
of things to uh to add to that which is
 
01:27:38.470 --> 01:27:38.480 align:start position:0%
a very good point um
 
01:27:39.590 --> 01:27:39.600 align:start position:0%
there were
 
01:27:41.669 --> 01:27:41.679 align:start position:0%

question

01:27:54.790 --> 01:27:54.800 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:27:57.270 --> 01:27:57.280 align:start position:0%
of whether how that was going to affect
 
01:27:59.590 --> 01:27:59.600 align:start position:0%
the cost per student and therefore the
 
01:28:02.390 --> 01:28:02.400 align:start position:0%
quality of the school and education
 
01:28:03.669 --> 01:28:03.679 align:start position:0%
the other
 
01:28:06.229 --> 01:28:06.239 align:start position:0%
was that i had i questioned where what
 
01:28:08.870 --> 01:28:08.880 align:start position:0%
was the source of the 15 percent drop in
 
01:28:11.270 --> 01:28:11.280 align:start position:0%
student enrollment and was told to look
 
01:28:13.669 --> 01:28:13.679 align:start position:0%
at the department of education's website
 
01:28:15.750 --> 01:28:15.760 align:start position:0%
which i did and found in the past 10
 
01:28:17.030 --> 01:28:17.040 align:start position:0%
years the
 
01:28:19.030 --> 01:28:19.040 align:start position:0%
decrease in enrollment was about three
 
01:28:19.040 --> 01:28:21.590 align:start position:0%
decrease in enrollment was about three
percent

01:28:21.590 --> 01:28:21.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:24.390 --> 01:28:24.400 align:start position:0%

i i defer to representative true 11 who
 
01:28:31.030 --> 01:28:31.040 align:start position:0%
might have represented
 
01:28:33.910 --> 01:28:33.920 align:start position:0%
don't say anything nice it's okay
 
01:28:35.350 --> 01:28:35.360 align:start position:0%
representative gilman i'm sorry i
 
01:28:37.030 --> 01:28:37.040 align:start position:0%
couldn't hear the last
 
01:28:39.030 --> 01:28:39.040 align:start position:0%
part of what you said
 
01:28:40.870 --> 01:28:40.880 align:start position:0%
about percentages
 
01:28:43.189 --> 01:28:43.199 align:start position:0%
uh we were told at the uh
 
01:28:46.070 --> 01:28:46.080 align:start position:0%
in the um hearing that the decrease in
 
01:28:48.070 --> 01:28:48.080 align:start position:0%
student enrollment was 15
 
01:28:50.070 --> 01:28:50.080 align:start position:0%
and when i did my calculations from the
 
01:28:52.550 --> 01:28:52.560 align:start position:0%
department of education it was is quite
 
01:28:55.750 --> 01:28:55.760 align:start position:0%
lower three percent over four thank you
 
01:28:57.830 --> 01:28:57.840 align:start position:0%
representative majority
 
01:29:00.229 --> 01:29:00.239 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um
 
01:29:02.229 --> 01:29:02.239 align:start position:0%
so if i understand this bill correctly
 
01:29:05.350 --> 01:29:05.360 align:start position:0%
if a district receives a special needs
 
01:29:05.360 --> 01:29:06.229 align:start position:0%
if a district receives a special needs
student

01:29:06.229 --> 01:29:06.239 align:start position:0%
student
 
01:29:09.110 --> 01:29:09.120 align:start position:0%
uh who moves in that would cost
 
01:29:11.510 --> 01:29:11.520 align:start position:0%
my community we'd be looking at we
 
01:29:13.110 --> 01:29:13.120 align:start position:0%
estimate about three hundred thousand
 
01:29:13.120 --> 01:29:14.310 align:start position:0%
estimate about three hundred thousand
dollars

01:29:14.310 --> 01:29:14.320 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
01:29:16.870 --> 01:29:16.880 align:start position:0%
and the board there's there's no
 
01:29:19.590 --> 01:29:19.600 align:start position:0%
majority to override the tax cap then
 
01:29:21.910 --> 01:29:21.920 align:start position:0%
we're on the hook for the full cost of
 
01:29:24.149 --> 01:29:24.159 align:start position:0%
that special needs student which we have
 
01:29:25.830 --> 01:29:25.840 align:start position:0%
an obligation to
 
01:29:27.350 --> 01:29:27.360 align:start position:0%
and in my community three hundred
 
01:29:29.189 --> 01:29:29.199 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars is three heads three
 
01:29:29.199 --> 01:29:30.149 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars is three heads three
people

01:29:30.149 --> 01:29:30.159 align:start position:0%
people
 
01:29:31.750 --> 01:29:31.760 align:start position:0%
so we need to fire three because you
 
01:29:32.709 --> 01:29:32.719 align:start position:0%
can't find three hundred thousand
 
01:29:34.790 --> 01:29:34.800 align:start position:0%
dollars in pencils and toilet paper
 
01:29:36.149 --> 01:29:36.159 align:start position:0%
so three hundred thousand dollars we
 
01:29:39.189 --> 01:29:39.199 align:start position:0%
need to fire three teachers in order to
 
01:29:41.270 --> 01:29:41.280 align:start position:0%
be able to afford that special needs
 
01:29:43.189 --> 01:29:43.199 align:start position:0%
student which we'd have an obligation to
 
01:29:46.070 --> 01:29:46.080 align:start position:0%
i am opposed to this bill
 
01:29:47.189 --> 01:29:47.199 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:29:49.669 --> 01:29:49.679 align:start position:0%
yes representative power
 
01:29:51.669 --> 01:29:51.679 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um
 
01:29:51.679 --> 01:29:52.629 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um
i

01:29:52.629 --> 01:29:52.639 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:29:54.070 --> 01:29:54.080 align:start position:0%
would like to respond to the
 
01:29:55.990 --> 01:29:56.000 align:start position:0%
representatives comments
 
01:29:57.830 --> 01:29:57.840 align:start position:0%
i would say that
 
01:29:57.840 --> 01:29:59.590 align:start position:0%
i would say that
with

01:29:59.590 --> 01:29:59.600 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:30:01.590 --> 01:30:01.600 align:start position:0%
within any budget
 
01:30:04.709 --> 01:30:04.719 align:start position:0%
difficult situ difficult decisions must
 
01:30:08.229 --> 01:30:08.239 align:start position:0%
be made and i it's not clear to me why
 
01:30:10.870 --> 01:30:10.880 align:start position:0%
the response is always
 
01:30:10.880 --> 01:30:12.470 align:start position:0%
the response is always
to

01:30:12.470 --> 01:30:12.480 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:30:15.430 --> 01:30:15.440 align:start position:0%
reduce teachers there are other areas in
 
01:30:17.910 --> 01:30:17.920 align:start position:0%
any given budget which reductions can be
 
01:30:20.229 --> 01:30:20.239 align:start position:0%
made so that would also that would be a
 
01:30:20.239 --> 01:30:21.430 align:start position:0%
made so that would also that would be a
choice

01:30:21.430 --> 01:30:21.440 align:start position:0%
choice
 
01:30:23.669 --> 01:30:23.679 align:start position:0%
and i would also like to add that with
 
01:30:26.470 --> 01:30:26.480 align:start position:0%
regard to special ed
 
01:30:26.480 --> 01:30:27.590 align:start position:0%
regard to special ed
students

01:30:27.590 --> 01:30:27.600 align:start position:0%
students
 
01:30:30.070 --> 01:30:30.080 align:start position:0%
do we not have catastrophic aid for
 
01:30:33.110 --> 01:30:33.120 align:start position:0%
which we can apply to that that would um
 
01:30:36.709 --> 01:30:36.719 align:start position:0%
go to pay for the education of such a
 
01:30:36.719 --> 01:30:37.910 align:start position:0%
go to pay for the education of such a
student

01:30:37.910 --> 01:30:37.920 align:start position:0%
student
 
01:30:39.750 --> 01:30:39.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for further discussion yes
 
01:30:39.760 --> 01:30:41.030 align:start position:0%
thank you for further discussion yes
representative

01:30:41.030 --> 01:30:41.040 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:30:43.110 --> 01:30:43.120 align:start position:0%
yes thank you i'm opposed to this bill
 
01:30:44.950 --> 01:30:44.960 align:start position:0%
and to address representative powers
 
01:30:47.270 --> 01:30:47.280 align:start position:0%
comment about catastrophic aid that
 
01:30:49.350 --> 01:30:49.360 align:start position:0%
doesn't kick until the following year so
 
01:30:51.110 --> 01:30:51.120 align:start position:0%
the school district has to front that
 
01:30:53.110 --> 01:30:53.120 align:start position:0%
money and if they don't have the ability
 
01:30:55.750 --> 01:30:55.760 align:start position:0%
to cover that cost
 
01:30:57.590 --> 01:30:57.600 align:start position:0%
they will have to fire teachers i know
 
01:30:58.870 --> 01:30:58.880 align:start position:0%
in merrimack
 
01:31:03.030 --> 01:31:03.040 align:start position:0%
about 75 at least of our budget is
 
01:31:04.870 --> 01:31:04.880 align:start position:0%
salary and benefits
 
01:31:08.149 --> 01:31:08.159 align:start position:0%
so there's no way that you can absorb a
 
01:31:10.390 --> 01:31:10.400 align:start position:0%
cost of a special ed student without a
 
01:31:10.400 --> 01:31:11.590 align:start position:0%
cost of a special ed student without a
reduction

01:31:11.590 --> 01:31:11.600 align:start position:0%
reduction
 
01:31:12.950 --> 01:31:12.960 align:start position:0%
in staff
 
01:31:12.960 --> 01:31:14.830 align:start position:0%
in staff
and

01:31:14.830 --> 01:31:14.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:31:17.669 --> 01:31:17.679 align:start position:0%
um get to that point when you reduce
 
01:31:17.679 --> 01:31:18.709 align:start position:0%
um get to that point when you reduce
staff

01:31:18.709 --> 01:31:18.719 align:start position:0%
staff
 
01:31:18.719 --> 01:31:19.590 align:start position:0%
staff
um

01:31:19.590 --> 01:31:19.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:31:21.990 --> 01:31:22.000 align:start position:0%
you're you're increasing class sizes
 
01:31:25.270 --> 01:31:25.280 align:start position:0%
you're reducing services even to
 
01:31:28.229 --> 01:31:28.239 align:start position:0%
our typical students so it has such a
 
01:31:31.030 --> 01:31:31.040 align:start position:0%
huge effect all over the district
 
01:31:32.790 --> 01:31:32.800 align:start position:0%
and the fact that this override has to
 
01:31:34.709 --> 01:31:34.719 align:start position:0%
be done by the legislative body
 
01:31:36.950 --> 01:31:36.960 align:start position:0%
sometimes districts within a school year
 
01:31:38.149 --> 01:31:38.159 align:start position:0%
have to make
 
01:31:40.229 --> 01:31:40.239 align:start position:0%
accommodations and to call a special
 
01:31:40.239 --> 01:31:41.510 align:start position:0%
accommodations and to call a special
meeting

01:31:41.510 --> 01:31:41.520 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
01:31:44.870 --> 01:31:44.880 align:start position:0%
i think is very expensive and also
 
01:31:47.189 --> 01:31:47.199 align:start position:0%
getting back to special ed and
 
01:31:48.950 --> 01:31:48.960 align:start position:0%
i don't know about your districts but
 
01:31:51.430 --> 01:31:51.440 align:start position:0%
many times when we fail to serve our
 
01:31:53.590 --> 01:31:53.600 align:start position:0%
special education students
 
01:31:56.149 --> 01:31:56.159 align:start position:0%
we risk spending a lot of money on legal
 
01:31:56.159 --> 01:31:57.270 align:start position:0%
we risk spending a lot of money on legal
costs

01:31:57.270 --> 01:31:57.280 align:start position:0%
costs
 
01:31:59.189 --> 01:31:59.199 align:start position:0%
because that's a federal requirement we
 
01:32:01.910 --> 01:32:01.920 align:start position:0%
also risk accreditation if a spending
 
01:32:04.229 --> 01:32:04.239 align:start position:0%
cap causes us to increase
 
01:32:05.750 --> 01:32:05.760 align:start position:0%
class sizes
 
01:32:08.390 --> 01:32:08.400 align:start position:0%
reduce maintenance costs there's so many
 
01:32:12.390 --> 01:32:12.400 align:start position:0%
parameters that go into accreditation
 
01:32:14.149 --> 01:32:14.159 align:start position:0%
many years ago when i served on the
 
01:32:16.149 --> 01:32:16.159 align:start position:0%
merrimack school board which i i served
 
01:32:18.870 --> 01:32:18.880 align:start position:0%
for almost nine years our accreditation
 
01:32:23.350 --> 01:32:23.360 align:start position:0%
was at risk because of class sizes so
 
01:32:25.669 --> 01:32:25.679 align:start position:0%
it's not an easy decision to let go of a
 
01:32:27.669 --> 01:32:27.679 align:start position:0%
teacher because you're putting much more
 
01:32:27.679 --> 01:32:29.110 align:start position:0%
teacher because you're putting much more
risk

01:32:29.110 --> 01:32:29.120 align:start position:0%
risk
 
01:32:30.709 --> 01:32:30.719 align:start position:0%
to the school district and to the
 
01:32:32.629 --> 01:32:32.639 align:start position:0%
students thank you
 
01:32:34.310 --> 01:32:34.320 align:start position:0%
representative clee
 
01:32:37.270 --> 01:32:37.280 align:start position:0%
thank you again mr chairman i i want to
 
01:32:40.629 --> 01:32:40.639 align:start position:0%
echo my colleagues um
 
01:32:42.310 --> 01:32:42.320 align:start position:0%
answers and i want to say that i am
 
01:32:44.229 --> 01:32:44.239 align:start position:0%
grateful that this is enabling that that
 
01:32:44.239 --> 01:32:45.270 align:start position:0%
grateful that this is enabling that that
does

01:32:45.270 --> 01:32:45.280 align:start position:0%
does
 
01:32:47.350 --> 01:32:47.360 align:start position:0%
um make that pill a little easier to
 
01:32:49.430 --> 01:32:49.440 align:start position:0%
swallow but the um
 
01:32:52.229 --> 01:32:52.239 align:start position:0%
the key here that i keep honing in on is
 
01:32:52.239 --> 01:32:54.310 align:start position:0%
the key here that i keep honing in on is
that

01:32:54.310 --> 01:32:54.320 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:32:57.910 --> 01:32:57.920 align:start position:0%
if 70 to 80 percent of the costs
 
01:33:00.470 --> 01:33:00.480 align:start position:0%
to any school budget is the variable
 
01:33:02.709 --> 01:33:02.719 align:start position:0%
cost of personnel
 
01:33:04.550 --> 01:33:04.560 align:start position:0%
there's no doubt in my mind that in
 
01:33:06.310 --> 01:33:06.320 align:start position:0%
order to save a significant amount of
 
01:33:08.790 --> 01:33:08.800 align:start position:0%
money we would have to reduce personnel
 
01:33:12.310 --> 01:33:12.320 align:start position:0%
so where do you reduce it and sadly
 
01:33:13.990 --> 01:33:14.000 align:start position:0%
as was pointed out
 
01:33:15.669 --> 01:33:15.679 align:start position:0%
teachers are probably one of the first
 
01:33:17.750 --> 01:33:17.760 align:start position:0%
to go or pairers or something of that
 
01:33:19.669 --> 01:33:19.679 align:start position:0%
nature which means we are affecting the
 
01:33:22.550 --> 01:33:22.560 align:start position:0%
class i think it was pointed out then a
 
01:33:25.669 --> 01:33:25.679 align:start position:0%
three hundred thousand uh dollar cut
 
01:33:27.590 --> 01:33:27.600 align:start position:0%
could mean you know three or four
 
01:33:29.830 --> 01:33:29.840 align:start position:0%
teachers or a number of pairs which
 
01:33:31.830 --> 01:33:31.840 align:start position:0%
means we're going to increase the class
 
01:33:31.840 --> 01:33:33.270 align:start position:0%
means we're going to increase the class
size

01:33:33.270 --> 01:33:33.280 align:start position:0%
size
 
01:33:34.950 --> 01:33:34.960 align:start position:0%
we're going to be putting more students
 
01:33:37.030 --> 01:33:37.040 align:start position:0%
in and the thing i keep hearing over and
 
01:33:39.669 --> 01:33:39.679 align:start position:0%
over again is that public schools don't
 
01:33:41.350 --> 01:33:41.360 align:start position:0%
work the classes are too big private
 
01:33:42.870 --> 01:33:42.880 align:start position:0%
schools have much smaller classes
 
01:33:44.790 --> 01:33:44.800 align:start position:0%
etcetera etcetera where we're setting
 
01:33:47.350 --> 01:33:47.360 align:start position:0%
ourselves up for failure
 
01:33:50.149 --> 01:33:50.159 align:start position:0%
yes this is enabling but if a district
 
01:33:51.910 --> 01:33:51.920 align:start position:0%
does put it through
 
01:33:53.350 --> 01:33:53.360 align:start position:0%
the hoops that they're going to have to
 
01:33:56.310 --> 01:33:56.320 align:start position:0%
jump through again i always run back to
 
01:33:59.030 --> 01:33:59.040 align:start position:0%
the unintended consequences i don't
 
01:33:59.040 --> 01:33:59.990 align:start position:0%
the unintended consequences i don't
think

01:33:59.990 --> 01:34:00.000 align:start position:0%
think
 
01:34:01.910 --> 01:34:01.920 align:start position:0%
anybody here in this room or on the
 
01:34:01.920 --> 01:34:02.870 align:start position:0%
anybody here in this room or on the
floor

01:34:02.870 --> 01:34:02.880 align:start position:0%
floor
 
01:34:05.510 --> 01:34:05.520 align:start position:0%
will want to have larger classroom sizes
 
01:34:07.510 --> 01:34:07.520 align:start position:0%
less teachers less paras
 
01:34:09.430 --> 01:34:09.440 align:start position:0%
less resources for our students in
 
01:34:10.790 --> 01:34:10.800 align:start position:0%
public schools
 
01:34:13.830 --> 01:34:13.840 align:start position:0%
by law we are required to have
 
01:34:15.430 --> 01:34:15.440 align:start position:0%
public schools and fund them
 
01:34:15.440 --> 01:34:16.790 align:start position:0%
public schools and fund them
appropriately

01:34:16.790 --> 01:34:16.800 align:start position:0%
appropriately
 
01:34:18.550 --> 01:34:18.560 align:start position:0%
we have these freedom choice accounts
 
01:34:18.560 --> 01:34:19.510 align:start position:0%
we have these freedom choice accounts
which

01:34:19.510 --> 01:34:19.520 align:start position:0%
which
 
01:34:21.030 --> 01:34:21.040 align:start position:0%
may or may not be taking i'm not going
 
01:34:23.030 --> 01:34:23.040 align:start position:0%
to debate that away from the public
 
01:34:24.870 --> 01:34:24.880 align:start position:0%
schools but the problem that we're
 
01:34:26.870 --> 01:34:26.880 align:start position:0%
having is we keep talking about reducing
 
01:34:28.390 --> 01:34:28.400 align:start position:0%
their budgets we keep talking about
 
01:34:30.149 --> 01:34:30.159 align:start position:0%
bigger classroom sizes
 
01:34:32.950 --> 01:34:32.960 align:start position:0%
that means less resources i fear for our
 
01:34:34.470 --> 01:34:34.480 align:start position:0%
students of tomorrow in the public
 
01:34:36.790 --> 01:34:36.800 align:start position:0%
school systems if we keep doing this so
 
01:34:39.110 --> 01:34:39.120 align:start position:0%
for this reason um i cannot vote and not
 
01:34:40.470 --> 01:34:40.480 align:start position:0%
to pass on this even though it is
 
01:34:42.470 --> 01:34:42.480 align:start position:0%

representative majori
 
01:36:35.430 --> 01:36:35.440 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um once again just
 
01:36:37.109 --> 01:36:37.119 align:start position:0%
like the 11 22 i'm going to have the
 
01:36:39.030 --> 01:36:39.040 align:start position:0%
unfortunate pleasure
 
01:36:42.149 --> 01:36:42.159 align:start position:0%
of notifying the sponsor that we passed
 
01:36:43.109 --> 01:36:43.119 align:start position:0%
his bill
 
01:36:45.590 --> 01:36:45.600 align:start position:0%
um because he was hoping that this one
 
01:36:48.950 --> 01:36:48.960 align:start position:0%
might go to interim study so that the
 
01:36:52.149 --> 01:36:52.159 align:start position:0%
des regulations now that are updating
 
01:36:55.189 --> 01:36:55.199 align:start position:0%
rules for recycling and compost uh while
 
01:36:56.550 --> 01:36:56.560 align:start position:0%
those are working through he thought
 
01:36:59.030 --> 01:36:59.040 align:start position:0%
that they might improve this bill
 
01:37:00.390 --> 01:37:00.400 align:start position:0%
so he actually thought after
 
01:37:02.149 --> 01:37:02.159 align:start position:0%
conversations that interim study would
 
01:37:04.390 --> 01:37:04.400 align:start position:0%
be a better idea ought to pass is fine
 
01:37:06.149 --> 01:37:06.159 align:start position:0%
because it gets us where we need it gets
 
01:37:06.159 --> 01:37:07.350 align:start position:0%
because it gets us where we need it gets
improvement

01:37:07.350 --> 01:37:07.360 align:start position:0%
improvement
 
01:37:08.870 --> 01:37:08.880 align:start position:0%
it does get improvement but it may
 
01:37:10.709 --> 01:37:10.719 align:start position:0%
require revisiting the bill as long as
 
01:37:12.790 --> 01:37:12.800 align:start position:0%
we are clear with that i'll let them
 
01:37:15.109 --> 01:37:15.119 align:start position:0%
know that next year we may have to tweak
 
01:37:18.229 --> 01:37:18.239 align:start position:0%
what if we approve the bill so either
 
01:37:20.070 --> 01:37:20.080 align:start position:0%
way you go on this i think the sponsor
 
01:37:22.149 --> 01:37:22.159 align:start position:0%
is going to be okay thank you
 
01:37:23.830 --> 01:37:23.840 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
01:37:26.390 --> 01:37:26.400 align:start position:0%
yes representative tripp uh
 
01:37:28.550 --> 01:37:28.560 align:start position:0%
i uh i agree with my fellow
 
01:37:30.229 --> 01:37:30.239 align:start position:0%
representative uh
 
01:37:32.550 --> 01:37:32.560 align:start position:0%
there's probably needs to be some more
 
01:37:34.790 --> 01:37:34.800 align:start position:0%
work done on this but
 
01:37:37.030 --> 01:37:37.040 align:start position:0%
all this bill really allows
 
01:37:38.550 --> 01:37:38.560 align:start position:0%
towns to do
 
01:37:40.790 --> 01:37:40.800 align:start position:0%
is to
 
01:37:42.390 --> 01:37:42.400 align:start position:0%
collect compost
 
01:37:42.400 --> 01:37:45.510 align:start position:0%
collect compost
or

01:37:45.510 --> 01:37:45.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:47.030 --> 01:37:47.040 align:start position:0%

company to uh to collect the combustible
 
01:37:53.910 --> 01:37:53.920 align:start position:0%
materials so it's one of these things
 
01:37:56.070 --> 01:37:56.080 align:start position:0%
where uh
 
01:37:58.070 --> 01:37:58.080 align:start position:0%
this is just the first step in in
 
01:38:00.629 --> 01:38:00.639 align:start position:0%
probably many steps in uh
 
01:38:02.950 --> 01:38:02.960 align:start position:0%
being able to uh provide a revenue
 
01:38:05.669 --> 01:38:05.679 align:start position:0%
source for towns uh
 
01:38:05.679 --> 01:38:06.950 align:start position:0%
source for towns uh

by
 
01:38:09.109 --> 01:38:09.119 align:start position:0%
their being able to sell or whatever
 
01:38:11.350 --> 01:38:11.360 align:start position:0%

01:39:24.229 --> 01:39:24.239 align:start position:0%
representative ryan yes
 
01:39:27.189 --> 01:39:27.199 align:start position:0%
and shannon dolan yes
 
01:39:31.109 --> 01:39:31.119 align:start position:0%
otp passes 19-0 without objection i'll
 
01:39:33.510 --> 01:39:33.520 align:start position:0%
place that on the consent calendar yes
 
01:39:34.790 --> 01:39:34.800 align:start position:0%
um so
 
01:39:36.950 --> 01:39:36.960 align:start position:0%
question if it goes on the consent
 
01:39:39.590 --> 01:39:39.600 align:start position:0%
calendar can floor amendments still be
 
01:39:41.430 --> 01:39:41.440 align:start position:0%
brought to it or would have to be pulled
 
01:39:43.270 --> 01:39:43.280 align:start position:0%
from the consent calendar for that to
 
01:39:46.790 --> 01:39:46.800 align:start position:0%
happen uh i i believe you have to pull
 
01:39:49.669 --> 01:39:49.679 align:start position:0%
it from the consent
 
01:39:52.470 --> 01:39:52.480 align:start position:0%
and it only only takes one member of the
 
01:39:54.870 --> 01:39:54.880 align:start position:0%
400 to pull it from consent so
 
01:39:56.470 --> 01:39:56.480 align:start position:0%
if you want to if if you don't want to
 
01:39:59.270 --> 01:39:59.280 align:start position:0%
under consent i won't no you you you you
 
01:40:00.790 --> 01:40:00.800 align:start position:0%
can put it on consent i don't want to be
 
01:40:03.109 --> 01:40:03.119 align:start position:0%
the one to do that but i was just
 
01:40:05.109 --> 01:40:05.119 align:start position:0%
wondering for
 
01:40:07.430 --> 01:40:07.440 align:start position:0%
reference first like to familiarize
 
01:40:09.910 --> 01:40:09.920 align:start position:0%
myself with process here
 
01:40:11.990 --> 01:40:12.000 align:start position:0%
it takes one representative to knock
 
01:40:13.750 --> 01:40:13.760 align:start position:0%
something off consent and it will go to
 
01:40:15.990 --> 01:40:16.000 align:start position:0%
the floor for a vote
 
01:40:18.790 --> 01:40:18.800 align:start position:0%
so consider that as you uh
 
01:40:21.510 --> 01:40:21.520 align:start position:0%
as you look forward to the next
 
01:40:23.510 --> 01:40:23.520 align:start position:0%
session that we have
 
01:40:25.430 --> 01:40:25.440 align:start position:0%
and you you're going to want to
 
01:40:28.149 --> 01:40:28.159 align:start position:0%
alert the house clerk
 
01:40:32.629 --> 01:40:32.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:35.350 --> 01:40:35.360 align:start position:0%
your leadership team would want to know
 
01:40:36.709 --> 01:40:36.719 align:start position:0%
this also
 
01:40:39.030 --> 01:40:39.040 align:start position:0%
so you're going to want to alert
 
01:40:42.229 --> 01:40:42.239 align:start position:0%
representative majori but
 
01:40:44.629 --> 01:40:44.639 align:start position:0%
process wise the clerk needs to know if
 
01:40:47.030 --> 01:40:47.040 align:start position:0%
you want to pull something off
 
01:40:48.790 --> 01:40:48.800 align:start position:0%
of consent
 
01:40:54.149 --> 01:40:54.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:57.430 --> 01:40:57.440 align:start position:0%
any other comments on the on our process
 
01:40:59.590 --> 01:40:59.600 align:start position:0%

01:41:48.470 --> 01:41:48.480 align:start position:0%
law exists in uh

162.
 
01:41:50.320 --> 01:41:51.510 align:start position:0%
162.
and

01:41:51.510 --> 01:41:51.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:41:54.070 --> 01:41:54.080 align:start position:0%
i found in uh
 
01:41:55.270 --> 01:41:55.280 align:start position:0%
if you look
 
01:41:57.189 --> 01:41:57.199 align:start position:0%
a little higher
 
01:41:58.870 --> 01:41:58.880 align:start position:0%
in uh
 
01:42:00.470 --> 01:42:00.480 align:start position:0%
section l
 
01:42:02.229 --> 01:42:02.239 align:start position:0%
colon 12.
 
01:42:03.430 --> 01:42:03.440 align:start position:0%
it states
 
01:42:04.950 --> 01:42:04.960 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
01:42:06.870 --> 01:42:06.880 align:start position:0%
in allocating funds under the community
 
01:42:08.950 --> 01:42:08.960 align:start position:0%
development block grant program the
 
01:42:11.750 --> 01:42:11.760 align:start position:0%
authority shall give priority
 
01:42:13.270 --> 01:42:13.280 align:start position:0%
to activities
 
01:42:16.470 --> 01:42:16.480 align:start position:0%
whereas this is directly contradictory
 
01:42:16.480 --> 01:42:18.390 align:start position:0%
whereas this is directly contradictory
to

01:42:18.390 --> 01:42:18.400 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:42:20.310 --> 01:42:20.320 align:start position:0%
the bill it says that
 
01:42:20.320 --> 01:42:21.510 align:start position:0%
the bill it says that
the

01:42:21.510 --> 01:42:21.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:42:24.390 --> 01:42:24.400 align:start position:0%

to housing for persons with lower
 
01:42:29.990 --> 01:42:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:32.229 --> 01:42:32.239 align:start position:0%
if you look at
 
01:42:32.239 --> 01:42:34.070 align:start position:0%
if you look at
l13

01:42:34.070 --> 01:42:34.080 align:start position:0%
l13
 
01:42:37.109 --> 01:42:37.119 align:start position:0%
it says these may include but are not
 
01:42:38.629 --> 01:42:38.639 align:start position:0%
limited to
 
01:42:38.639 --> 01:42:39.430 align:start position:0%
limited to
and

01:42:39.430 --> 01:42:39.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:42:41.430 --> 01:42:41.440 align:start position:0%
once again if you go back to the the
 
01:42:44.390 --> 01:42:44.400 align:start position:0%
bill it says shall be limited to
 
01:42:46.550 --> 01:42:46.560 align:start position:0%
now there seems to be some housekeeping
 
01:42:48.550 --> 01:42:48.560 align:start position:0%
that needs to be done in this bill
 
01:42:48.560 --> 01:42:49.669 align:start position:0%
that needs to be done in this bill
to

01:42:49.669 --> 01:42:49.679 align:start position:0%

01:42:50.870 --> 01:42:50.880 align:start position:0%
correct
 
01:42:50.880 --> 01:42:52.229 align:start position:0%
correct

01:42:52.229 --> 01:42:52.239 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:42:54.790 --> 01:42:54.800 align:start position:0%
the opposition to the the bill that's
 
01:42:57.270 --> 01:42:57.280 align:start position:0%
being proposed as to what
 
01:42:59.030 --> 01:42:59.040 align:start position:0%
law exists
 
01:43:01.030 --> 01:43:01.040 align:start position:0%

so
 
01:43:09.430 --> 01:43:09.440 align:start position:0%
i i seem to remember that
 
01:43:12.390 --> 01:43:12.400 align:start position:0%
this bill hearing from
 
01:43:15.430 --> 01:43:15.440 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor that he intended to
 
01:43:18.070 --> 01:43:18.080 align:start position:0%
withdraw this bill and
 
01:43:21.510 --> 01:43:21.520 align:start position:0%
asked us to vote itl on it and i
 
01:43:24.310 --> 01:43:24.320 align:start position:0%
remember knowing that at the time of the
 
01:43:26.550 --> 01:43:26.560 align:start position:0%
hearing so i'm wondering
 
01:43:28.790 --> 01:43:28.800 align:start position:0%
if someone could help refresh my memory
 
01:43:31.910 --> 01:43:31.920 align:start position:0%
if we actually did that then if we are
 
01:43:34.790 --> 01:43:34.800 align:start position:0%
we've already it'll this or
 
01:43:39.109 --> 01:43:39.119 align:start position:0%
if we still need to vote now this is the
 
01:43:42.870 --> 01:43:42.880 align:start position:0%
first itl of record that i'm aware of if
 
01:43:44.629 --> 01:43:44.639 align:start position:0%
anyone else has a different memory on
 
01:43:46.470 --> 01:43:46.480 align:start position:0%
that let me know
 
01:43:48.550 --> 01:43:48.560 align:start position:0%
yes uh representative
 
01:43:49.750 --> 01:43:49.760 align:start position:0%
and then we'll go to representative
 
01:43:49.760 --> 01:43:50.870 align:start position:0%
and then we'll go to representative
powell

01:43:50.870 --> 01:43:50.880 align:start position:0%
powell
 
01:43:53.510 --> 01:43:53.520 align:start position:0%
yes i also remember that uh the prime
 
01:43:56.550 --> 01:43:56.560 align:start position:0%
sponsor asked us to itl this bill we
 
01:43:58.229 --> 01:43:58.239 align:start position:0%
heard it and we discussed that at the
 
01:43:59.750 --> 01:43:59.760 align:start position:0%
time we heard it
 
01:44:02.310 --> 01:44:02.320 align:start position:0%
that the sponsor wished to have it
 
01:44:06.149 --> 01:44:06.159 align:start position:0%
um disposed of because it actually
 
01:44:08.310 --> 01:44:08.320 align:start position:0%
doesn't work the way he thought it would
 
01:44:11.189 --> 01:44:11.199 align:start position:0%
so we haven't yet voted on it but it is
 
01:44:13.270 --> 01:44:13.280 align:start position:0%
the request of the sponsor that we itl
 
01:44:16.470 --> 01:44:16.480 align:start position:0%
this bill thank you representative power

checking because we we i think i just
 
01:44:35.750 --> 01:44:35.760 align:start position:0%
heard all this i thought we already
 
01:44:37.669 --> 01:44:37.679 align:start position:0%
exact it because the sponsor wanted to
 
01:44:39.430 --> 01:44:39.440 align:start position:0%
itl so i just wanted to make sure that
 
01:44:42.470 --> 01:44:42.480 align:start position:0%
we have we weren't running a foul of an
 
01:44:43.830 --> 01:44:43.840 align:start position:0%

01:46:38.870 --> 01:46:38.880 align:start position:0%
powell do you want to speak to your
 
01:46:41.350 --> 01:46:41.360 align:start position:0%
motion yes thank you mr chair this bill
 
01:46:43.830 --> 01:46:43.840 align:start position:0%
rectifies a number of discrepancies with
 
01:46:46.790 --> 01:46:46.800 align:start position:0%
the current veterans tax credits
 
01:46:49.109 --> 01:46:49.119 align:start position:0%
under rsa 72.
 
01:46:51.189 --> 01:46:51.199 align:start position:0%
first it um
 
01:46:55.030 --> 01:46:55.040 align:start position:0%
rsa 2150 defines a veteran
 
01:46:57.910 --> 01:46:57.920 align:start position:0%
and this definition does
 
01:47:02.310 --> 01:47:02.320 align:start position:0%
under the all the veterans tax credits
 
01:47:04.709 --> 01:47:04.719 align:start position:0%
the definitions aren't are not aligned
 
01:47:07.510 --> 01:47:07.520 align:start position:0%
so what it does is it brings those in
 
01:47:10.310 --> 01:47:10.320 align:start position:0%
alignment and also
 
01:47:10.320 --> 01:47:11.510 align:start position:0%
alignment and also
under

01:47:11.510 --> 01:47:11.520 align:start position:0%
under
 
01:47:14.629 --> 01:47:14.639 align:start position:0%
rsa 72 those veterans tax credit
 
01:47:16.950 --> 01:47:16.960 align:start position:0%
sections it excludes currently serving
 
01:47:19.270 --> 01:47:19.280 align:start position:0%
veterans which is
 
01:47:20.709 --> 01:47:20.719 align:start position:0%
not consistent
 
01:47:23.669 --> 01:47:23.679 align:start position:0%
with the definition of a veteran and
 
01:47:27.430 --> 01:47:27.440 align:start position:0%
this legislation corrects that and
 
01:47:28.310 --> 01:47:28.320 align:start position:0%
i guess
 
01:47:31.669 --> 01:47:31.679 align:start position:0%
notably that this bill
 
01:47:33.990 --> 01:47:34.000 align:start position:0%
includes active duty
 
01:47:36.229 --> 01:47:36.239 align:start position:0%
service people
 
01:47:38.870 --> 01:47:38.880 align:start position:0%
so that they can qualify towards that
 
01:47:38.880 --> 01:47:40.149 align:start position:0%
so that they can qualify towards that
90-day

01:47:40.149 --> 01:47:40.159 align:start position:0%
90-day
 
01:47:42.310 --> 01:47:42.320 align:start position:0%
requirement in order to
 
01:47:45.590 --> 01:47:45.600 align:start position:0%
qualify for the veterans tax credits
 
01:47:48.950 --> 01:47:48.960 align:start position:0%

clean

01:47:53.430 --> 01:47:53.440 align:start position:0%
clean
 
01:47:55.990 --> 01:47:56.000 align:start position:0%
uh thank you uh mr chairman
 
01:47:58.870 --> 01:47:58.880 align:start position:0%
um in in doing some homework and so on
 
01:48:00.870 --> 01:48:00.880 align:start position:0%
and looking at
 
01:48:04.310 --> 01:48:04.320 align:start position:0%
title 38 usc 101 under definitions and
 
01:48:06.149 --> 01:48:06.159 align:start position:0%
definition of veterans
 
01:48:09.270 --> 01:48:09.280 align:start position:0%
does in fact exclude any active duty it
 
01:48:10.709 --> 01:48:10.719 align:start position:0%
refers to
 
01:48:12.470 --> 01:48:12.480 align:start position:0%
a veteran as
 
01:48:15.109 --> 01:48:15.119 align:start position:0%
they who have served
 
01:48:18.229 --> 01:48:18.239 align:start position:0%
within the military and so on so my
 
01:48:20.629 --> 01:48:20.639 align:start position:0%
concern is that when we roll active duty
 
01:48:23.270 --> 01:48:23.280 align:start position:0%
into this while um i want to do as much
 
01:48:25.669 --> 01:48:25.679 align:start position:0%
as i possibly can to active duty
 
01:48:27.430 --> 01:48:27.440 align:start position:0%
where we could possibly be running a
 
01:48:29.430 --> 01:48:29.440 align:start position:0%
foul um in that
 
01:48:30.830 --> 01:48:30.840 align:start position:0%
when a
 
01:48:33.750 --> 01:48:33.760 align:start position:0%
veteran qualifies for this they have to
 
01:48:35.750 --> 01:48:35.760 align:start position:0%
be a resident of
 
01:48:38.470 --> 01:48:38.480 align:start position:0%
that community etc
 
01:48:40.629 --> 01:48:40.639 align:start position:0%
when someone is active duty and they are
 
01:48:43.750 --> 01:48:43.760 align:start position:0%
stationed overseas or in another state
 
01:48:46.229 --> 01:48:46.239 align:start position:0%
they still reside for all intent
 
01:48:48.310 --> 01:48:48.320 align:start position:0%
purposes of voting etc
 
01:48:50.790 --> 01:48:50.800 align:start position:0%
within that community so they might
 
01:48:53.830 --> 01:48:53.840 align:start position:0%
resolve reside in merrimack
 
01:48:55.990 --> 01:48:56.000 align:start position:0%
thus being qualified for the veterans
 
01:48:58.790 --> 01:48:58.800 align:start position:0%
credit but not physically being there
 
01:49:01.430 --> 01:49:01.440 align:start position:0%
that is my concern about the active duty
 
01:49:02.790 --> 01:49:02.800 align:start position:0%
portion of it
 
01:49:02.800 --> 01:49:04.229 align:start position:0%
portion of it
[Music]

01:49:04.229 --> 01:49:04.239 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:49:04.239 --> 01:49:05.270 align:start position:0%
[Music]
so

01:49:05.270 --> 01:49:05.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:49:05.280 --> 01:49:05.990 align:start position:0%
so
the

01:49:05.990 --> 01:49:06.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:49:08.790 --> 01:49:08.800 align:start position:0%
the dd214 is basically discharge papers
 
01:49:10.950 --> 01:49:10.960 align:start position:0%
and it is something that is often used
 
01:49:12.229 --> 01:49:12.239 align:start position:0%
in um
 
01:49:15.030 --> 01:49:15.040 align:start position:0%
that particular thing so again i i refer
 
01:49:18.629 --> 01:49:18.639 align:start position:0%
back to title 38 usc 101 definitions
 
01:49:21.350 --> 01:49:21.360 align:start position:0%
where it does talk about a veteran
 
01:49:24.070 --> 01:49:24.080 align:start position:0%
versus an active member of the service
 
01:49:24.080 --> 01:49:24.950 align:start position:0%
versus an active member of the service
so

01:49:24.950 --> 01:49:24.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:49:29.589 --> 01:49:29.599 align:start position:0%
um i i'm just concerned that we are
 
01:49:31.830 --> 01:49:31.840 align:start position:0%
kind of mixing apples and oranges in
 
01:49:33.430 --> 01:49:33.440 align:start position:0%
here so thank you
 
01:49:36.229 --> 01:49:36.239 align:start position:0%
thank you just uh to add on
 
01:49:39.910 --> 01:49:39.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:39.920 --> 01:49:41.109 align:start position:0%

at their home of record

01:49:49.030 --> 01:49:49.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:49:50.709 --> 01:49:50.719 align:start position:0%
we haven't defined that yet your home of
 
01:49:53.910 --> 01:49:53.920 align:start position:0%
record is where you lived before you
 
01:49:55.109 --> 01:49:55.119 align:start position:0%
went into the
 
01:49:58.629 --> 01:49:58.639 align:start position:0%
service so if you if you lived in nashua
 
01:50:01.109 --> 01:50:01.119 align:start position:0%
and you joined the marines
 
01:50:02.870 --> 01:50:02.880 align:start position:0%
and you're now in
 
01:50:05.270 --> 01:50:05.280 align:start position:0%
south carolina in boot camp
 
01:50:07.270 --> 01:50:07.280 align:start position:0%
and election comes up
 
01:50:09.350 --> 01:50:09.360 align:start position:0%
you have to obtain an absentee ballot
 
01:50:11.589 --> 01:50:11.599 align:start position:0%
from nashua and you vote in your home of
 
01:50:12.950 --> 01:50:12.960 align:start position:0%
record there you don't vote down in
 
01:50:15.189 --> 01:50:15.199 align:start position:0%
south carolina
 
01:50:17.270 --> 01:50:17.280 align:start position:0%
yes representative clee
 
01:50:19.030 --> 01:50:19.040 align:start position:0%
that's kind of what i was
 
01:50:21.189 --> 01:50:21.199 align:start position:0%
alluding to i apologize if i misstated
 
01:50:21.199 --> 01:50:22.390 align:start position:0%
alluding to i apologize if i misstated
it

01:50:22.390 --> 01:50:22.400 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:50:24.070 --> 01:50:24.080 align:start position:0%
that was the point i was making if you
 
01:50:25.830 --> 01:50:25.840 align:start position:0%
went into the service and you lived in
 
01:50:27.990 --> 01:50:28.000 align:start position:0%
nashua merrimack or whatever national
 
01:50:29.589 --> 01:50:29.599 align:start position:0%
home and you owned a home at that time
 
01:50:31.189 --> 01:50:31.199 align:start position:0%
when you went in
 
01:50:33.830 --> 01:50:33.840 align:start position:0%
that in fact would be your um place of
 
01:50:36.629 --> 01:50:36.639 align:start position:0%
residence and therefore you're voting um
 
01:50:39.109 --> 01:50:39.119 align:start position:0%
from there so i i'm sorry if i
 
01:50:41.189 --> 01:50:41.199 align:start position:0%
i do tend to stutter over my words okay
 
01:50:45.030 --> 01:50:45.040 align:start position:0%
thank you representative gallagher
 
01:50:47.510 --> 01:50:47.520 align:start position:0%
so um
 
01:50:50.390 --> 01:50:50.400 align:start position:0%
i i was just reviewing my notes from the
 
01:50:54.070 --> 01:50:54.080 align:start position:0%
hearing on this and um
 
01:50:55.589 --> 01:50:55.599 align:start position:0%
one thing i had noted down was that
 
01:50:57.910 --> 01:50:57.920 align:start position:0%
there were concerns about
 
01:50:57.920 --> 01:50:59.510 align:start position:0%
there were concerns about
um

01:50:59.510 --> 01:50:59.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:51:01.589 --> 01:51:01.599 align:start position:0%
possible overlap
 
01:51:04.830 --> 01:51:04.840 align:start position:0%
with um house bill
 
01:51:07.109 --> 01:51:07.119 align:start position:0%
1375 which
 
01:51:07.119 --> 01:51:09.510 align:start position:0%
1375 which
um

01:51:09.510 --> 01:51:09.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:09.520 --> 01:51:10.470 align:start position:0%
 
which

01:51:10.470 --> 01:51:10.480 align:start position:0%
which
 
01:51:13.669 --> 01:51:13.679 align:start position:0%
we already voted to pass today
 
01:51:13.679 --> 01:51:14.709 align:start position:0%
we already voted to pass today
um

01:51:14.709 --> 01:51:14.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:51:14.719 --> 01:51:15.750 align:start position:0%
um
so

01:51:15.750 --> 01:51:15.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:51:17.510 --> 01:51:17.520 align:start position:0%
i i didn't quite
 
01:51:20.229 --> 01:51:20.239 align:start position:0%
catch whether those concerns were
 
01:51:22.149 --> 01:51:22.159 align:start position:0%
addressed or not so i was wondering if
 
01:51:24.229 --> 01:51:24.239 align:start position:0%
someone could just
 
01:51:27.109 --> 01:51:27.119 align:start position:0%
remind me about
 
01:51:29.430 --> 01:51:29.440 align:start position:0%
the how the interactions between this
 
01:51:34.310 --> 01:51:34.320 align:start position:0%
bill and house bill 1375 work
 
01:51:36.629 --> 01:51:36.639 align:start position:0%
okay i'll ask any volunteers that want
 
01:51:38.310 --> 01:51:38.320 align:start position:0%
to speak to that
 
01:51:40.229 --> 01:51:40.239 align:start position:0%
yes representative majori
 
01:51:41.430 --> 01:51:41.440 align:start position:0%
unless someone else would like to i
 
01:51:43.270 --> 01:51:43.280 align:start position:0%
think i was the one who who muddied the
 
01:51:46.229 --> 01:51:46.239 align:start position:0%
waters on that one and i i apologized
 
01:51:49.750 --> 01:51:49.760 align:start position:0%
my concern was that if 1375 didn't pass
 
01:51:51.669 --> 01:51:51.679 align:start position:0%
and we didn't change
 
01:51:53.669 --> 01:51:53.679 align:start position:0%
what the definition of honorably
 
01:51:55.910 --> 01:51:55.920 align:start position:0%
discharge or clear that language up
 
01:51:57.589 --> 01:51:57.599 align:start position:0%
about honorably discharge and discharge
 
01:51:59.750 --> 01:51:59.760 align:start position:0%
with honor if that didn't pass
 
01:52:01.910 --> 01:52:01.920 align:start position:0%
then we'd have to clar it would make
 
01:52:03.830 --> 01:52:03.840 align:start position:0%
sense to try to clarify it here but
 
01:52:06.310 --> 01:52:06.320 align:start position:0%
since 1375 went through
 
01:52:08.470 --> 01:52:08.480 align:start position:0%
what'll happen is
 
01:52:11.589 --> 01:52:11.599 align:start position:0%
this this uh this bill notes
 
01:52:13.990 --> 01:52:14.000 align:start position:0%
that statute that was being amended so
 
01:52:16.229 --> 01:52:16.239 align:start position:0%
everything should be fine and i
 
01:52:17.750 --> 01:52:17.760 align:start position:0%
apologize that i just wanted to make
 
01:52:19.189 --> 01:52:19.199 align:start position:0%
sure it was a dotting of the eyes and
 
01:52:21.109 --> 01:52:21.119 align:start position:0%
crossing of the t's and it seems to i've
 
01:52:22.550 --> 01:52:22.560 align:start position:0%
done that so thank you thank you for
 
01:52:24.229 --> 01:52:24.239 align:start position:0%
that clarification any further
 
01:52:24.239 --> 01:52:26.149 align:start position:0%
that clarification any further
discussion

01:52:26.149 --> 01:52:26.159 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
01:52:27.830 --> 01:52:27.840 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
01:52:27.840 --> 01:52:28.870 align:start position:0%
yes representative
wrong

01:52:28.870 --> 01:52:28.880 align:start position:0%
wrong
 
01:52:31.510 --> 01:52:31.520 align:start position:0%
yet my concern is with by including
 
01:52:33.830 --> 01:52:33.840 align:start position:0%
active duty service people
 
01:52:36.790 --> 01:52:36.800 align:start position:0%
um shouldn't this require a fiscal note
 
01:52:38.950 --> 01:52:38.960 align:start position:0%
because uh i'm just thinking of
 
01:52:41.669 --> 01:52:41.679 align:start position:0%
merrimack and anecdotally we have a lot
 
01:52:44.390 --> 01:52:44.400 align:start position:0%
of there's i can probably think of six
 
01:52:46.470 --> 01:52:46.480 align:start position:0%
to eight people just that i personally
 
01:52:46.480 --> 01:52:47.510 align:start position:0%
to eight people just that i personally
know

01:52:47.510 --> 01:52:47.520 align:start position:0%
know
 
01:52:47.520 --> 01:52:48.629 align:start position:0%
know
whose

01:52:48.629 --> 01:52:48.639 align:start position:0%
whose
 
01:52:48.639 --> 01:52:49.830 align:start position:0%
whose
child's

01:52:49.830 --> 01:52:49.840 align:start position:0%
child's
 
01:52:51.750 --> 01:52:51.760 align:start position:0%
home of record is in merrimack but
 
01:52:55.189 --> 01:52:55.199 align:start position:0%
they're serving overseas or in
 
01:52:57.030 --> 01:52:57.040 align:start position:0%
you know away from home in a military
 
01:52:59.510 --> 01:52:59.520 align:start position:0%
base so there would be
 
01:53:01.830 --> 01:53:01.840 align:start position:0%
this uh it would be it would have a
 
01:53:03.990 --> 01:53:04.000 align:start position:0%
fiscal note on it should have a fiscal
 
01:53:06.870 --> 01:53:06.880 align:start position:0%
note on it so that communities can be
 
01:53:09.189 --> 01:53:09.199 align:start position:0%
prepared for any
 
01:53:11.430 --> 01:53:11.440 align:start position:0%
tax impact
 
01:53:13.830 --> 01:53:13.840 align:start position:0%
i notice it also takes effect 60 days
 
01:53:15.990 --> 01:53:16.000 align:start position:0%
after passage so
 
01:53:18.950 --> 01:53:18.960 align:start position:0%
it would take into effect before
 
01:53:22.310 --> 01:53:22.320 align:start position:0%
likely before or during a budgetary year
 
01:53:23.430 --> 01:53:23.440 align:start position:0%
rather than
 
01:53:24.870 --> 01:53:24.880 align:start position:0%
being effective
 
01:53:28.229 --> 01:53:28.239 align:start position:0%
at the start of a new budgetary year
 
01:53:29.910 --> 01:53:29.920 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:53:29.920 --> 01:53:31.270 align:start position:0%
thank you
yes

01:53:31.270 --> 01:53:31.280 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:53:33.189 --> 01:53:33.199 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
01:53:33.199 --> 01:53:34.790 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
um

01:53:34.790 --> 01:53:34.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:53:36.629 --> 01:53:36.639 align:start position:0%
unfortunately somebody's going to have
 
01:53:38.550 --> 01:53:38.560 align:start position:0%
to remind me but i think we had a very
 
01:53:41.589 --> 01:53:41.599 align:start position:0%
long and substantive conversation
 
01:53:44.149 --> 01:53:44.159 align:start position:0%
about several previous
 
01:53:47.270 --> 01:53:47.280 align:start position:0%
tax credit tax exemption bills
 
01:53:49.990 --> 01:53:50.000 align:start position:0%
for certain classes of people
 
01:53:52.709 --> 01:53:52.719 align:start position:0%
and how that would have
 
01:53:54.950 --> 01:53:54.960 align:start position:0%
something to the tune of 55 million
 
01:53:57.830 --> 01:53:57.840 align:start position:0%
dollar impact in downshifting property
 
01:54:01.990 --> 01:54:02.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:03.589 --> 01:54:03.599 align:start position:0%
excuse me mr chair
 
01:54:07.109 --> 01:54:07.119 align:start position:0%
yes to other new hampshire residents
 
01:54:07.119 --> 01:54:09.030 align:start position:0%
yes to other new hampshire residents
uh

01:54:09.030 --> 01:54:09.040 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:54:10.629 --> 01:54:10.639 align:start position:0%
should we not be having the same
 
01:54:13.750 --> 01:54:13.760 align:start position:0%
conversation about this bill as all the
 
01:54:17.750 --> 01:54:17.760 align:start position:0%
others and if not why not
 
01:54:20.390 --> 01:54:20.400 align:start position:0%
thank you for for that input
 
01:54:22.310 --> 01:54:22.320 align:start position:0%
is there any further discussion on the
 
01:54:24.550 --> 01:54:24.560 align:start position:0%
bill before we vote on it
 
01:54:24.560 --> 01:54:25.510 align:start position:0%
bill before we vote on it
oh

01:54:25.510 --> 01:54:25.520 align:start position:0%
oh
 
01:54:25.520 --> 01:54:28.870 align:start position:0%
oh
yes

01:54:28.870 --> 01:54:28.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:30.310 --> 01:54:30.320 align:start position:0%
representative gilman
 
01:54:34.229 --> 01:54:34.239 align:start position:0%
thank you i would just like to um
 
01:54:36.390 --> 01:54:36.400 align:start position:0%
either point out or ask for
 
01:54:37.830 --> 01:54:37.840 align:start position:0%
agreement that
 
01:54:40.070 --> 01:54:40.080 align:start position:0%
uh towns that have adopted the veterans
 
01:54:41.430 --> 01:54:41.440 align:start position:0%
tax credit would
 
01:54:44.470 --> 01:54:44.480 align:start position:0%
need to re-adopt this if the legislation
 
01:54:44.480 --> 01:54:48.070 align:start position:0%
need to re-adopt this if the legislation
passes

01:54:48.070 --> 01:54:48.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:49.109 --> 01:54:49.119 align:start position:0%
that was my
 
01:54:50.470 --> 01:54:50.480 align:start position:0%
understanding in the notes that would
 
01:54:53.589 --> 01:54:53.599 align:start position:0%
have to be re-adopted
 
01:54:55.750 --> 01:54:55.760 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
01:54:55.760 --> 01:54:59.350 align:start position:0%
thank you um
representative

01:54:59.350 --> 01:54:59.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:01.910 --> 01:55:01.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um
 
01:55:04.149 --> 01:55:04.159 align:start position:0%
i was thinking the same thing that
 
01:55:06.229 --> 01:55:06.239 align:start position:0%
my colleague from lebanon
 
01:55:07.910 --> 01:55:07.920 align:start position:0%
had brought up we did have a very
 
01:55:10.790 --> 01:55:10.800 align:start position:0%
substantive discussion in regards to
 
01:55:13.990 --> 01:55:14.000 align:start position:0%
one class of people's
 
01:55:15.589 --> 01:55:15.599 align:start position:0%
putting the burden of one class of
 
01:55:17.510 --> 01:55:17.520 align:start position:0%
peoples on another class of people so i
 
01:55:19.109 --> 01:55:19.119 align:start position:0%
don't think i'm saying that correctly i
 
01:55:21.189 --> 01:55:21.199 align:start position:0%
hope you know what i mean
 
01:55:22.790 --> 01:55:22.800 align:start position:0%
and i'm very
 
01:55:26.070 --> 01:55:26.080 align:start position:0%
very wary of doing that i
 
01:55:28.310 --> 01:55:28.320 align:start position:0%
wholeheartedly support
 
01:55:31.270 --> 01:55:31.280 align:start position:0%
our united states military and all their
 
01:55:33.350 --> 01:55:33.360 align:start position:0%
veterans of course
 
01:55:33.360 --> 01:55:34.470 align:start position:0%
veterans of course
um

01:55:34.470 --> 01:55:34.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:55:38.070 --> 01:55:38.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:40.709 --> 01:55:40.719 align:start position:0%
support and help and
 
01:55:42.709 --> 01:55:42.719 align:start position:0%
well thank you uh
 
01:55:44.629 --> 01:55:44.639 align:start position:0%
i think the words you were reaching for
 
01:55:44.639 --> 01:55:46.550 align:start position:0%
i think the words you were reaching for
was

01:55:46.550 --> 01:55:46.560 align:start position:0%
was
 
01:55:49.030 --> 01:55:49.040 align:start position:0%
a tax shift from one set of voters
 
01:55:50.470 --> 01:55:50.480 align:start position:0%
that's exactly correct thank you very
 
01:55:52.229 --> 01:55:52.239 align:start position:0%
much mr chair i was looking for that
 
01:55:53.830 --> 01:55:53.840 align:start position:0%
word um
 
01:55:57.189 --> 01:55:57.199 align:start position:0%
so i'm not in favor of this thank you
 
01:55:57.199 --> 01:55:59.350 align:start position:0%
so i'm not in favor of this thank you
representative

01:55:59.350 --> 01:55:59.360 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:56:01.589 --> 01:56:01.599 align:start position:0%
again thank you for allowing me a second
 
01:56:03.669 --> 01:56:03.679 align:start position:0%
chance to speak um i do want to
 
01:56:05.589 --> 01:56:05.599 align:start position:0%
reiterate the um
 
01:56:07.350 --> 01:56:07.360 align:start position:0%
the attack shift and
 
01:56:08.870 --> 01:56:08.880 align:start position:0%
and so on um
 
01:56:11.430 --> 01:56:11.440 align:start position:0%
and the previous ones that we
 
01:56:14.550 --> 01:56:14.560 align:start position:0%
basically uh passed on so to speak with
 
01:56:17.030 --> 01:56:17.040 align:start position:0%
because it was exactly doing that i know
 
01:56:19.430 --> 01:56:19.440 align:start position:0%
that um some people say that it's only
 
01:56:21.910 --> 01:56:21.920 align:start position:0%
about you know one percent of the of the
 
01:56:23.510 --> 01:56:23.520 align:start position:0%
current um
 
01:56:26.149 --> 01:56:26.159 align:start position:0%
that are currently serving are are going
 
01:56:28.709 --> 01:56:28.719 align:start position:0%
to be homeowners and so on i i think
 
01:56:29.990 --> 01:56:30.000 align:start position:0%
that we're going to see that number
 
01:56:30.000 --> 01:56:31.270 align:start position:0%
that we're going to see that number
significant

01:56:31.270 --> 01:56:31.280 align:start position:0%
significant
 
01:56:32.709 --> 01:56:32.719 align:start position:0%
i think when
 
01:56:35.109 --> 01:56:35.119 align:start position:0%
um active duty
 
01:56:37.430 --> 01:56:37.440 align:start position:0%
decide that they're going to be retiring
 
01:56:42.149 --> 01:56:42.159 align:start position:0%
they oftentimes try to get a um an
 
01:56:43.990 --> 01:56:44.000 align:start position:0%
assignment to
 
01:56:46.390 --> 01:56:46.400 align:start position:0%
an area so that they can retire in that
 
01:56:49.910 --> 01:56:49.920 align:start position:0%
area they put down routes they
 
01:56:52.550 --> 01:56:52.560 align:start position:0%
they buy homes
 
01:56:55.430 --> 01:56:55.440 align:start position:0%
i think new hampshire
 
01:56:57.669 --> 01:56:57.679 align:start position:0%
we attract a lot of veterans because we
 
01:57:00.550 --> 01:57:00.560 align:start position:0%
are so veteran friendly so i think that
 
01:57:02.310 --> 01:57:02.320 align:start position:0%
these veterans that are going to be
 
01:57:02.320 --> 01:57:03.589 align:start position:0%
these veterans that are going to be
retiring

01:57:03.589 --> 01:57:03.599 align:start position:0%
retiring
 
01:57:05.669 --> 01:57:05.679 align:start position:0%
will be coming i'm not saying they're
 
01:57:07.350 --> 01:57:07.360 align:start position:0%
going to come in droves and we're going
 
01:57:09.270 --> 01:57:09.280 align:start position:0%
to have massive amount of people coming
 
01:57:12.390 --> 01:57:12.400 align:start position:0%
in at 1. but when i look at the current
 
01:57:15.270 --> 01:57:15.280 align:start position:0%
statewide tax loss meaning tax shift tax
 
01:57:18.390 --> 01:57:18.400 align:start position:0%
burden of almost 32 million dollars and
 
01:57:20.310 --> 01:57:20.320 align:start position:0%
we're going to add to that
 
01:57:22.950 --> 01:57:22.960 align:start position:0%
even if we only added one percent to
 
01:57:25.430 --> 01:57:25.440 align:start position:0%
that we're still adding to it
 
01:57:25.440 --> 01:57:26.470 align:start position:0%
that we're still adding to it
and

01:57:26.470 --> 01:57:26.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:57:28.149 --> 01:57:28.159 align:start position:0%
that means young families are going to
 
01:57:29.830 --> 01:57:29.840 align:start position:0%
be picking this up
 
01:57:32.229 --> 01:57:32.239 align:start position:0%
and i'm very worried and very concerned
 
01:57:33.910 --> 01:57:33.920 align:start position:0%
about it so
 
01:57:35.430 --> 01:57:35.440 align:start position:0%
i want to do everything i can for our
 
01:57:37.589 --> 01:57:37.599 align:start position:0%
veteran for our active duty but there
 
01:57:39.270 --> 01:57:39.280 align:start position:0%
comes a point when we have to kind of
 
01:57:40.550 --> 01:57:40.560 align:start position:0%
slow the roll
 
01:57:43.189 --> 01:57:43.199 align:start position:0%
we've done it in the last few bills
 
01:57:44.870 --> 01:57:44.880 align:start position:0%
i think we need to take a breather see
 
01:57:46.950 --> 01:57:46.960 align:start position:0%
how everything is happening it seems
 
01:57:48.790 --> 01:57:48.800 align:start position:0%
like every year we just have one more
 
01:57:50.390 --> 01:57:50.400 align:start position:0%
after another of a different group of
 
01:57:53.109 --> 01:57:53.119 align:start position:0%
people so thank you thank you for that
 
01:57:55.910 --> 01:57:55.920 align:start position:0%
input yes representative power
 
01:57:58.149 --> 01:57:58.159 align:start position:0%
if i understand the comments correctly
 
01:58:01.189 --> 01:58:01.199 align:start position:0%
there's a concern of an influx of active
 
01:58:03.350 --> 01:58:03.360 align:start position:0%
duty service members
 
01:58:05.189 --> 01:58:05.199 align:start position:0%
coming to new hampshire to reside i'm
 
01:58:07.510 --> 01:58:07.520 align:start position:0%
not aware of any
 
01:58:10.790 --> 01:58:10.800 align:start position:0%
military bases in new hampshire
 
01:58:10.800 --> 01:58:11.830 align:start position:0%
military bases in new hampshire
that

01:58:11.830 --> 01:58:11.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:58:11.840 --> 01:58:12.790 align:start position:0%
that
house

01:58:12.790 --> 01:58:12.800 align:start position:0%
house
 
01:58:17.030 --> 01:58:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:17.040 --> 01:58:18.070 align:start position:0%
 
the

01:58:18.070 --> 01:58:18.080 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:58:21.510 --> 01:58:21.520 align:start position:0%
peace area the area outside of the
 
01:58:24.790 --> 01:58:24.800 align:start position:0%
manchester mall the uh
 
01:58:31.910 --> 01:58:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:33.589 --> 01:58:33.599 align:start position:0%
well let's make sure representative
 
01:58:38.629 --> 01:58:38.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:40.629 --> 01:58:40.639 align:start position:0%
i know that this hanscom air force base
 
01:58:41.910 --> 01:58:41.920 align:start position:0%
but i'm not
 
01:58:43.750 --> 01:58:43.760 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that pease is no
 
01:58:46.149 --> 01:58:46.159 align:start position:0%
longer an active air force base it's
 
01:58:46.159 --> 01:58:47.030 align:start position:0%
longer an active air force base it's
been

01:58:47.030 --> 01:58:47.040 align:start position:0%
been
 
01:58:49.750 --> 01:58:49.760 align:start position:0%
downgraded so i'm not sure what what the
 
01:58:52.390 --> 01:58:52.400 align:start position:0%
reference is at this point
 
01:58:54.229 --> 01:58:54.239 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
01:58:55.350 --> 01:58:55.360 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you
 
01:58:57.189 --> 01:58:57.199 align:start position:0%
representative power for the question
 
01:58:58.950 --> 01:58:58.960 align:start position:0%
you're correct fees is no longer an
 
01:59:01.669 --> 01:59:01.679 align:start position:0%
active air force base yes it does yet it
 
01:59:03.350 --> 01:59:03.360 align:start position:0%
does house
 
01:59:05.270 --> 01:59:05.280 align:start position:0%
the air national guard
 
01:59:05.280 --> 01:59:06.149 align:start position:0%
the air national guard
um

01:59:06.149 --> 01:59:06.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:59:08.550 --> 01:59:08.560 align:start position:0%
that's their headquarters are there
 
01:59:11.830 --> 01:59:11.840 align:start position:0%
and i don't i don't know the numbers um
 
01:59:13.510 --> 01:59:13.520 align:start position:0%
of how many people are there but they
 
01:59:16.229 --> 01:59:16.239 align:start position:0%
are consistently
 
01:59:18.149 --> 01:59:18.159 align:start position:0%
coming and going and working in that
 
01:59:18.159 --> 01:59:20.870 align:start position:0%
coming and going and working in that
space

01:59:20.870 --> 01:59:20.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:22.629 --> 01:59:22.639 align:start position:0%
yes representative power thank you mr
 
01:59:24.629 --> 01:59:24.639 align:start position:0%
chair that the mission of the any
 
01:59:26.629 --> 01:59:26.639 align:start position:0%
national guard within the state is to
 
01:59:28.310 --> 01:59:28.320 align:start position:0%
serve the state
 
01:59:30.149 --> 01:59:30.159 align:start position:0%
so it makes sense that those service
 
01:59:33.589 --> 01:59:33.599 align:start position:0%
members would reside in the state
 
01:59:34.709 --> 01:59:34.719 align:start position:0%
correct thank you
 
01:59:34.719 --> 01:59:36.470 align:start position:0%
correct thank you
representative

01:59:36.470 --> 01:59:36.480 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:59:38.470 --> 01:59:38.480 align:start position:0%
uh thank you again um
 
01:59:40.229 --> 01:59:40.239 align:start position:0%
i i started my
 
01:59:43.030 --> 01:59:43.040 align:start position:0%
last year's career with the
 
01:59:45.430 --> 01:59:45.440 align:start position:0%
federal government in dod
 
01:59:47.350 --> 01:59:47.360 align:start position:0%
i went from there to the veterans
 
01:59:47.360 --> 01:59:49.669 align:start position:0%
i went from there to the veterans
affairs

01:59:49.669 --> 01:59:49.679 align:start position:0%
affairs
 
01:59:52.709 --> 01:59:52.719 align:start position:0%
area of the federal government and
 
01:59:55.669 --> 01:59:55.679 align:start position:0%
i can tell you that when someone does
 
01:59:55.679 --> 01:59:57.189 align:start position:0%
i can tell you that when someone does
retire

01:59:57.189 --> 01:59:57.199 align:start position:0%
retire
 
01:59:58.709 --> 01:59:58.719 align:start position:0%
they will ask for an assignment
 
02:00:01.030 --> 02:00:01.040 align:start position:0%
sometimes the assignment is a base
 
02:00:03.270 --> 02:00:03.280 align:start position:0%
sometimes the assignment can be with a
 
02:00:05.510 --> 02:00:05.520 align:start position:0%
business so for instance i had a lot of
 
02:00:07.589 --> 02:00:07.599 align:start position:0%
military that worked with me when i
 
02:00:10.629 --> 02:00:10.639 align:start position:0%
worked with the um avco
 
02:00:12.629 --> 02:00:12.639 align:start position:0%
it was called the air force plant
 
02:00:15.990 --> 02:00:16.000 align:start position:0%
representative office that was out of um
 
02:00:17.750 --> 02:00:17.760 align:start position:0%
massachusetts yes
 
02:00:19.669 --> 02:00:19.679 align:start position:0%
but a lot of those people still lived
 
02:00:22.070 --> 02:00:22.080 align:start position:0%
and bought homes in new hampshire
 
02:00:23.990 --> 02:00:24.000 align:start position:0%
i worked
 
02:00:25.830 --> 02:00:25.840 align:start position:0%
at a variety of different areas i have
 
02:00:27.990 --> 02:00:28.000 align:start position:0%
friends who work in hanscom
 
02:00:30.310 --> 02:00:30.320 align:start position:0%
and that that is where they're assigned
 
02:00:32.790 --> 02:00:32.800 align:start position:0%
they have homes in nashua
 
02:00:34.390 --> 02:00:34.400 align:start position:0%
one of my constituents that i just spoke
 
02:00:36.709 --> 02:00:36.719 align:start position:0%
to yesterday
 
02:00:39.669 --> 02:00:39.679 align:start position:0%
moved this way and was assigned to
 
02:00:39.679 --> 02:00:41.990 align:start position:0%
moved this way and was assigned to
peas

02:00:41.990 --> 02:00:42.000 align:start position:0%
peas
 
02:00:43.109 --> 02:00:43.119 align:start position:0%
i've talked to those that have been
 
02:00:45.270 --> 02:00:45.280 align:start position:0%
assigned to otis granted that's a cape
 
02:00:48.470 --> 02:00:48.480 align:start position:0%
you know nice place to live and so on
 
02:00:50.790 --> 02:00:50.800 align:start position:0%
they don't always live next to where
 
02:00:52.950 --> 02:00:52.960 align:start position:0%
they're assigned to
 
02:00:54.470 --> 02:00:54.480 align:start position:0%
they're going to buy a home where they
 
02:00:56.950 --> 02:00:56.960 align:start position:0%
feel that they want to retire and part
 
02:00:59.030 --> 02:00:59.040 align:start position:0%
of that reason is when they move the
 
02:01:01.430 --> 02:01:01.440 align:start position:0%
federal government helps them move
 
02:01:03.270 --> 02:01:03.280 align:start position:0%
so they're going to try to move
 
02:01:05.109 --> 02:01:05.119 align:start position:0%
sometimes they move and get an apartment
 
02:01:08.390 --> 02:01:08.400 align:start position:0%
and then sometimes they buy a home so
 
02:01:10.390 --> 02:01:10.400 align:start position:0%
just because we don't have a large
 
02:01:12.149 --> 02:01:12.159 align:start position:0%
active base doesn't mean that the people
 
02:01:13.189 --> 02:01:13.199 align:start position:0%
aren't going to be coming to new
 
02:01:15.030 --> 02:01:15.040 align:start position:0%
hampshire so thank you
 
02:01:15.910 --> 02:01:15.920 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:01:15.920 --> 02:01:18.550 align:start position:0%
thank you
representative

02:01:18.550 --> 02:01:18.560 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:01:20.149 --> 02:01:20.159 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
02:01:22.070 --> 02:01:22.080 align:start position:0%
just for clarification um in
 
02:01:23.589 --> 02:01:23.599 align:start position:0%
appreciation of
 
02:01:25.750 --> 02:01:25.760 align:start position:0%
my colleagues comment about the national
 
02:01:27.910 --> 02:01:27.920 align:start position:0%
guard i looked it up real quick and the
 
02:01:29.870 --> 02:01:29.880 align:start position:0%
peace air national guard base is the
 
02:01:32.149 --> 02:01:32.159 align:start position:0%
157th air
 
02:01:34.550 --> 02:01:34.560 align:start position:0%
refueling wing which is
 
02:01:37.270 --> 02:01:37.280 align:start position:0%
its primary mission is refueling to all
 
02:01:39.270 --> 02:01:39.280 align:start position:0%
u.s armed forces
 
02:01:41.430 --> 02:01:41.440 align:start position:0%
and allied nations aircraft extending
 
02:01:43.430 --> 02:01:43.440 align:start position:0%
their flying range
 
02:01:45.270 --> 02:01:45.280 align:start position:0%
with the capacity of transporting cargo
 
02:01:45.280 --> 02:01:46.390 align:start position:0%
with the capacity of transporting cargo
personnel

02:01:46.390 --> 02:01:46.400 align:start position:0%
personnel
 
02:01:48.229 --> 02:01:48.239 align:start position:0%
and medevac
 
02:01:49.830 --> 02:01:49.840 align:start position:0%
operations additional missions include
 
02:01:51.350 --> 02:01:51.360 align:start position:0%
homeland defense
 
02:01:53.589 --> 02:01:53.599 align:start position:0%
and air traffic control
 
02:01:56.950 --> 02:01:56.960 align:start position:0%
and they are the future home of the kc
 
02:02:01.030 --> 02:02:01.040 align:start position:0%
46a pegasus air refueling tanker
 
02:02:01.040 --> 02:02:02.149 align:start position:0%
46a pegasus air refueling tanker
um

02:02:02.149 --> 02:02:02.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:02:04.629 --> 02:02:04.639 align:start position:0%
they may or may not live in new
 
02:02:06.950 --> 02:02:06.960 align:start position:0%
hampshire but it's definitely a national
 
02:02:08.470 --> 02:02:08.480 align:start position:0%
mission that they're
 
02:02:10.229 --> 02:02:10.239 align:start position:0%
providing only common i wanted to make
 
02:02:12.310 --> 02:02:12.320 align:start position:0%
for clarification thank you thank you
 
02:02:14.709 --> 02:02:14.719 align:start position:0%
representative tripp
 
02:02:18.550 --> 02:02:18.560 align:start position:0%
well i'm i'm sure we could probably
 
02:02:20.629 --> 02:02:20.639 align:start position:0%
solve this problem of acting duty
 
02:02:23.109 --> 02:02:23.119 align:start position:0%
members moving to new hampshire by
 
02:02:23.119 --> 02:02:24.229 align:start position:0%
members moving to new hampshire by
simply

02:02:24.229 --> 02:02:24.239 align:start position:0%
simply
 
02:02:25.430 --> 02:02:25.440 align:start position:0%
getting rid of
 
02:02:29.030 --> 02:02:29.040 align:start position:0%
all the bases because i'm i believe that
 
02:02:30.870 --> 02:02:30.880 align:start position:0%
the amount of money that
 
02:02:33.910 --> 02:02:33.920 align:start position:0%
the bases bring to the local economy
 
02:02:36.070 --> 02:02:36.080 align:start position:0%
far outweighs
 
02:02:37.750 --> 02:02:37.760 align:start position:0%
any money that
 
02:02:39.430 --> 02:02:39.440 align:start position:0%
the veterans are going to get from the
 
02:02:42.229 --> 02:02:42.239 align:start position:0%
veterans tax credits so
 
02:02:44.149 --> 02:02:44.159 align:start position:0%
possibly we should look into that thank
 
02:02:47.109 --> 02:02:47.119 align:start position:0%
you let me give you a real life example
 
02:02:47.119 --> 02:02:49.030 align:start position:0%
you let me give you a real life example
um

02:02:49.030 --> 02:02:49.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:02:50.229 --> 02:02:50.239 align:start position:0%
meaning me
 
02:02:53.350 --> 02:02:53.360 align:start position:0%
when i left the military
 
02:02:54.790 --> 02:02:54.800 align:start position:0%
they said where do you want to go now
 
02:02:57.270 --> 02:02:57.280 align:start position:0%
and i said i want to go home
 
02:02:57.280 --> 02:02:58.550 align:start position:0%
and i said i want to go home
so

02:02:58.550 --> 02:02:58.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:03:00.790 --> 02:03:00.800 align:start position:0%
they said well your home of record is
 
02:03:02.470 --> 02:03:02.480 align:start position:0%
nashua new hampshire
 
02:03:04.070 --> 02:03:04.080 align:start position:0%
and it's
 
02:03:06.390 --> 02:03:06.400 align:start position:0%
about 1400 miles from where you are
 
02:03:07.589 --> 02:03:07.599 align:start position:0%
right now
 
02:03:10.870 --> 02:03:10.880 align:start position:0%
so we will rent you a moving van
 
02:03:12.790 --> 02:03:12.800 align:start position:0%
and put all your stuff in it and we'll
 
02:03:15.030 --> 02:03:15.040 align:start position:0%
move you up to 1400 miles in any
 
02:03:16.550 --> 02:03:16.560 align:start position:0%
direction you want to go but no more
 
02:03:18.629 --> 02:03:18.639 align:start position:0%
than that
 
02:03:20.550 --> 02:03:20.560 align:start position:0%
so i took the
 
02:03:22.790 --> 02:03:22.800 align:start position:0%
1400 miles and i came home i didn't go
 
02:03:25.830 --> 02:03:25.840 align:start position:0%
to a military base or i didn't go to
 
02:03:28.709 --> 02:03:28.719 align:start position:0%
a guard unit i just went home
 
02:03:30.790 --> 02:03:30.800 align:start position:0%
so that's that's my personal experience
 
02:03:33.270 --> 02:03:33.280 align:start position:0%
if that adds anything to the discussion
 
02:03:35.109 --> 02:03:35.119 align:start position:0%
yes representative power
 
02:03:37.669 --> 02:03:37.679 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um unfortunately i
 
02:03:40.149 --> 02:03:40.159 align:start position:0%
missed the description that
 
02:03:42.550 --> 02:03:42.560 align:start position:0%
my esteemed colleague gave with regard
 
02:03:44.070 --> 02:03:44.080 align:start position:0%
to the what
 
02:03:46.390 --> 02:03:46.400 align:start position:0%
what's going on at peace
 
02:03:48.870 --> 02:03:48.880 align:start position:0%
and i will look it up when when i get
 
02:03:51.589 --> 02:03:51.599 align:start position:0%
home and my comment would be
 
02:03:53.109 --> 02:03:53.119 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure if that would have been a
 
02:03:55.669 --> 02:03:55.679 align:start position:0%
reserve component at peace
 
02:03:55.679 --> 02:03:56.470 align:start position:0%
reserve component at peace
so

02:03:56.470 --> 02:03:56.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:03:59.030 --> 02:03:59.040 align:start position:0%
and the last thing that i'll say is
 
02:04:01.430 --> 02:04:01.440 align:start position:0%
that this is enabling legislation if a
 
02:04:03.430 --> 02:04:03.440 align:start position:0%
community and the majority of the people
 
02:04:06.870 --> 02:04:06.880 align:start position:0%
in the community do not want to provide
 
02:04:08.950 --> 02:04:08.960 align:start position:0%
this these types of tax credits then
 
02:04:11.350 --> 02:04:11.360 align:start position:0%
they do not need to
 
02:04:14.470 --> 02:04:14.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:16.069 --> 02:04:16.079 align:start position:0%
new information or i don't want to start
 
02:04:18.310 --> 02:04:18.320 align:start position:0%
an argument here
 
02:04:20.709 --> 02:04:20.719 align:start position:0%
i i apologize if i appear to be that
 
02:04:23.589 --> 02:04:23.599 align:start position:0%
right no my question is going to be that
 
02:04:27.030 --> 02:04:27.040 align:start position:0%
it is enabling but if we pass this
 
02:04:28.629 --> 02:04:28.639 align:start position:0%
and a community doesn't want to do it
 
02:04:31.030 --> 02:04:31.040 align:start position:0%
they would have to roll back
 
02:04:32.390 --> 02:04:32.400 align:start position:0%
their current
 
02:04:34.229 --> 02:04:34.239 align:start position:0%
um credit
 
02:04:35.830 --> 02:04:35.840 align:start position:0%
i just want to make sure that i
 
02:04:38.470 --> 02:04:38.480 align:start position:0%
understand that that's all i'm asking so
 
02:04:40.390 --> 02:04:40.400 align:start position:0%
in other words if a community already
 
02:04:41.589 --> 02:04:41.599 align:start position:0%
has this
 
02:04:44.950 --> 02:04:44.960 align:start position:0%
the the um standard optional
 
02:04:46.790 --> 02:04:46.800 align:start position:0%
veterans tax credits but they did not
 
02:04:48.550 --> 02:04:48.560 align:start position:0%
want to have to add these additional
 
02:04:49.910 --> 02:04:49.920 align:start position:0%
people to it
 
02:04:52.709 --> 02:04:52.719 align:start position:0%
um there's no
 
02:04:53.910 --> 02:04:53.920 align:start position:0%
way that they can say i'm just not going
 
02:04:55.270 --> 02:04:55.280 align:start position:0%
to add these additional they would have
 
02:04:57.589 --> 02:04:57.599 align:start position:0%
to roll back their current veterans
 
02:05:00.709 --> 02:05:00.719 align:start position:0%
credit for all credit is that correct
 
02:05:00.719 --> 02:05:02.709 align:start position:0%
credit for all credit is that correct
okay

02:05:02.709 --> 02:05:02.719 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:05:02.719 --> 02:05:03.750 align:start position:0%
okay
anybody

02:05:03.750 --> 02:05:03.760 align:start position:0%
anybody
 
02:05:04.870 --> 02:05:04.880 align:start position:0%
have a
 
02:05:08.069 --> 02:05:08.079 align:start position:0%
stronger knowledge of that of how the
 
02:05:16.229 --> 02:05:16.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:17.669 --> 02:05:17.679 align:start position:0%
okay i think i'm going to move the
 
02:05:21.990 --> 02:05:22.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:24.149 --> 02:05:24.159 align:start position:0%
oh i'm sorry representative
 
02:05:27.030 --> 02:05:27.040 align:start position:0%
no merrimack has a veterans tax credit
 
02:05:31.510 --> 02:05:31.520 align:start position:0%
already so if this bill were to pass
 
02:05:34.470 --> 02:05:34.480 align:start position:0%
we would have no choice but to extend it
 
02:05:34.480 --> 02:05:35.189 align:start position:0%
we would have no choice but to extend it
to

02:05:35.189 --> 02:05:35.199 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:05:38.069 --> 02:05:38.079 align:start position:0%
those that continue to serve
 
02:05:38.079 --> 02:05:38.870 align:start position:0%
those that continue to serve
which

02:05:38.870 --> 02:05:38.880 align:start position:0%
which
 
02:05:41.109 --> 02:05:41.119 align:start position:0%
it's kind of strange because
 
02:05:42.950 --> 02:05:42.960 align:start position:0%
you know in line four it says is a
 
02:05:42.960 --> 02:05:44.149 align:start position:0%
you know in line four it says is a
veteran

02:05:44.149 --> 02:05:44.159 align:start position:0%
veteran
 
02:05:46.550 --> 02:05:46.560 align:start position:0%
in line six it says continues to serve
 
02:05:47.750 --> 02:05:47.760 align:start position:0%
so that's
 
02:05:51.030 --> 02:05:51.040 align:start position:0%
definitely a conflict with title 38
 
02:05:52.950 --> 02:05:52.960 align:start position:0%
it doesn't seem to make much sense but
 
02:05:55.270 --> 02:05:55.280 align:start position:0%
merrimack will
 
02:05:58.310 --> 02:05:58.320 align:start position:0%
will have their taxes increase because
 
02:06:00.629 --> 02:06:00.639 align:start position:0%
of this if this passes and i i want to
 
02:06:03.830 --> 02:06:03.840 align:start position:0%
just reiterate my concern that this does
 
02:06:06.149 --> 02:06:06.159 align:start position:0%
not have a fiscal note so i won't be
 
02:06:08.390 --> 02:06:08.400 align:start position:0%
voting for it
 
02:06:09.750 --> 02:06:09.760 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:06:11.430 --> 02:06:11.440 align:start position:0%

02:06:11.440 --> 02:06:13.430 align:start position:0%
representative power you have new
information

02:06:13.430 --> 02:06:13.440 align:start position:0%
information
 
02:06:15.430 --> 02:06:15.440 align:start position:0%
well i would just like to say the reason
 
02:06:17.669 --> 02:06:17.679 align:start position:0%
why continues to serve is to make it
 
02:06:20.470 --> 02:06:20.480 align:start position:0%
abundantly clear what the purpose was so
 
02:06:20.480 --> 02:06:22.310 align:start position:0%
abundantly clear what the purpose was so
that

02:06:22.310 --> 02:06:22.320 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:06:25.189 --> 02:06:25.199 align:start position:0%
okay thank you as a as a
 
02:06:27.109 --> 02:06:27.119 align:start position:0%

02:06:28.550 --> 02:06:28.560 align:start position:0%

uh we're gonna go back
 
02:08:01.109 --> 02:08:01.119 align:start position:0%
and tackle house bill 1342 which we took
 
02:08:04.310 --> 02:08:04.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:08.470 --> 02:08:08.480 align:start position:0%
uh our legislative assistant
 
02:08:10.790 --> 02:08:10.800 align:start position:0%
did some research
 
02:08:13.589 --> 02:08:13.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:13.599 --> 02:08:14.870 align:start position:0%
 
our

02:08:14.870 --> 02:08:14.880 align:start position:0%
our
 
02:08:16.470 --> 02:08:16.480 align:start position:0%
process today
 
02:08:18.870 --> 02:08:18.880 align:start position:0%
during that recess he went and
 
02:08:19.990 --> 02:08:20.000 align:start position:0%
spoke with
 
02:08:21.669 --> 02:08:21.679 align:start position:0%
legislative legal
 
02:08:24.470 --> 02:08:24.480 align:start position:0%
and the feedback he got was that
 
02:08:26.709 --> 02:08:26.719 align:start position:0%
the bill that we're considering 1342
 
02:08:28.390 --> 02:08:28.400 align:start position:0%
does not contradict
 
02:08:28.400 --> 02:08:29.270 align:start position:0%
does not contradict
the

02:08:29.270 --> 02:08:29.280 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:08:31.669 --> 02:08:31.679 align:start position:0%
supreme court ruling that was brought to
 
02:08:32.870 --> 02:08:32.880 align:start position:0%
our attention
 
02:08:34.790 --> 02:08:34.800 align:start position:0%
by representative klee
 
02:08:34.800 --> 02:08:36.870 align:start position:0%
by representative klee
so

02:08:36.870 --> 02:08:36.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:08:40.229 --> 02:08:40.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:43.030 --> 02:08:43.040 align:start position:0%
we have a motion and a second
 
02:08:45.030 --> 02:08:45.040 align:start position:0%
for an itl
 
02:08:45.040 --> 02:08:46.390 align:start position:0%
for an itl
on

02:08:46.390 --> 02:08:46.400 align:start position:0%
on
 
02:08:46.400 --> 02:08:48.069 align:start position:0%
on
1342

02:08:48.069 --> 02:08:48.079 align:start position:0%
1342
 
02:08:51.189 --> 02:08:51.199 align:start position:0%
so representative klee uh thank you um
 
02:08:52.229 --> 02:08:52.239 align:start position:0%
and and thank you for getting that
 
02:08:54.229 --> 02:08:54.239 align:start position:0%
information i don't think there was ever
 
02:08:56.709 --> 02:08:56.719 align:start position:0%
a question that this bill contradicted
 
02:08:58.550 --> 02:08:58.560 align:start position:0%
the supreme court
 
02:09:00.790 --> 02:09:00.800 align:start position:0%
decision i think what
 
02:09:00.800 --> 02:09:02.229 align:start position:0%
decision i think what
um

02:09:02.229 --> 02:09:02.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:09:04.709 --> 02:09:04.719 align:start position:0%
the what the supreme court decision
 
02:09:07.270 --> 02:09:07.280 align:start position:0%
proved was that nashua does not have the
 
02:09:10.069 --> 02:09:10.079 align:start position:0%
override ability and hence the reason
 
02:09:10.079 --> 02:09:11.109 align:start position:0%
override ability and hence the reason
for

02:09:11.109 --> 02:09:11.119 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:09:13.750 --> 02:09:13.760 align:start position:0%
this particular thing was to put in
 
02:09:17.189 --> 02:09:17.199 align:start position:0%
an override provision for nashua um
 
02:09:19.910 --> 02:09:19.920 align:start position:0%
so i never felt that the um
 
02:09:23.270 --> 02:09:23.280 align:start position:0%
this bill contradicted the supreme court
 
02:09:25.830 --> 02:09:25.840 align:start position:0%
the the comment was that
 
02:09:27.990 --> 02:09:28.000 align:start position:0%
because of the supreme court decision it
 
02:09:28.000 --> 02:09:29.270 align:start position:0%
because of the supreme court decision it
proved

02:09:29.270 --> 02:09:29.280 align:start position:0%
proved
 
02:09:31.589 --> 02:09:31.599 align:start position:0%
that the necessity to have this
 
02:09:31.599 --> 02:09:33.030 align:start position:0%
that the necessity to have this
particular

02:09:33.030 --> 02:09:33.040 align:start position:0%
particular
 
02:09:33.040 --> 02:09:33.990 align:start position:0%
particular
um

02:09:33.990 --> 02:09:34.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:09:36.069 --> 02:09:36.079 align:start position:0%
comment not um that there was
 
02:09:37.669 --> 02:09:37.679 align:start position:0%
contradiction between the supreme court
 
02:09:40.550 --> 02:09:40.560 align:start position:0%
of this one so that that was the reason
 
02:09:42.149 --> 02:09:42.159 align:start position:0%
for my bringing the supreme court
 
02:09:43.990 --> 02:09:44.000 align:start position:0%
decision to all of you
 
02:09:47.430 --> 02:09:47.440 align:start position:0%
to show you um what the decision was and
 
02:09:49.910 --> 02:09:49.920 align:start position:0%
what the statements were made and so on
 
02:09:51.109 --> 02:09:51.119 align:start position:0%
um i never felt there was a
 
02:09:54.069 --> 02:09:54.079 align:start position:0%
contradiction to it i just felt that um
 
02:09:56.390 --> 02:09:56.400 align:start position:0%
without this bill
 
02:09:59.189 --> 02:09:59.199 align:start position:0%
nashville has no override provision even
 
02:10:00.790 --> 02:10:00.800 align:start position:0%
though in the past
 
02:10:02.709 --> 02:10:02.719 align:start position:0%
they may have done it
 
02:10:05.109 --> 02:10:05.119 align:start position:0%
what i'm saying is now we know for a
 
02:10:05.119 --> 02:10:06.069 align:start position:0%
what i'm saying is now we know for a
fact

02:10:06.069 --> 02:10:06.079 align:start position:0%
fact
 
02:10:07.910 --> 02:10:07.920 align:start position:0%
that the supreme court has ruled we do
 
02:10:11.109 --> 02:10:11.119 align:start position:0%
not have it so to do it would be
 
02:10:11.119 --> 02:10:12.470 align:start position:0%
not have it so to do it would be
illegal

02:10:12.470 --> 02:10:12.480 align:start position:0%
illegal
 
02:10:15.510 --> 02:10:15.520 align:start position:0%
and i personally as a board member don't
 
02:10:18.470 --> 02:10:18.480 align:start position:0%
want to do anything illegal yet my hands
 
02:10:21.910 --> 02:10:21.920 align:start position:0%
will be tied as for being able to put a
 
02:10:24.870 --> 02:10:24.880 align:start position:0%
charter change that takes time you need
 
02:10:26.390 --> 02:10:26.400 align:start position:0%
to get signatures
 
02:10:29.750 --> 02:10:29.760 align:start position:0%
um and that just has not happened
 
02:10:29.760 --> 02:10:30.550 align:start position:0%
um and that just has not happened
yes

02:10:30.550 --> 02:10:30.560 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:10:32.709 --> 02:10:32.719 align:start position:0%
i i understand the motions i want this
 
02:10:33.830 --> 02:10:33.840 align:start position:0%
to pass
 
02:10:36.550 --> 02:10:36.560 align:start position:0%
or you want it to pass i want this to to
 
02:10:38.069 --> 02:10:38.079 align:start position:0%
pass um
 
02:10:40.470 --> 02:10:40.480 align:start position:0%
because we need it we need the override
 
02:10:43.430 --> 02:10:43.440 align:start position:0%
we need those lines that are on
 
02:10:47.589 --> 02:10:47.599 align:start position:0%
seven through nine we need this to pass
 
02:10:50.550 --> 02:10:50.560 align:start position:0%
i'm not i'm not concerned that this uh
 
02:10:51.990 --> 02:10:52.000 align:start position:0%
there anything like this i'm just
 
02:10:54.390 --> 02:10:54.400 align:start position:0%
concerned that right now nashua is the
 
02:10:56.310 --> 02:10:56.320 align:start position:0%
only municipality
 
02:10:59.750 --> 02:10:59.760 align:start position:0%
with a cap that has no override ability
 
02:11:02.550 --> 02:11:02.560 align:start position:0%
and the supreme court decision proved
 
02:11:05.270 --> 02:11:05.280 align:start position:0%
that and showed that we have no override
 
02:11:09.270 --> 02:11:09.280 align:start position:0%
ability and sb 52 did not
 
02:11:12.390 --> 02:11:12.400 align:start position:0%
allow nashua to have an override ability
 
02:11:15.189 --> 02:11:15.199 align:start position:0%
it overrode the supreme court decision
 
02:11:16.870 --> 02:11:16.880 align:start position:0%
that said
 
02:11:19.030 --> 02:11:19.040 align:start position:0%
it was unenforceable
 
02:11:20.950 --> 02:11:20.960 align:start position:0%
is the way i think that the decision
 
02:11:23.030 --> 02:11:23.040 align:start position:0%
came down from the supreme court but it
 
02:11:26.069 --> 02:11:26.079 align:start position:0%
did not give us an override provision
 
02:11:28.470 --> 02:11:28.480 align:start position:0%
okay thank you for that clarification
 
02:11:28.480 --> 02:11:36.069 align:start position:0%
okay thank you for that clarification
representative

02:11:36.069 --> 02:11:36.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:38.870 --> 02:11:38.880 align:start position:0%
michael put your microphone on paul
 
02:11:40.629 --> 02:11:40.639 align:start position:0%
thank you is nashua the only one that
 
02:11:42.629 --> 02:11:42.639 align:start position:0%
can't do this in the state
 
02:11:43.910 --> 02:11:43.920 align:start position:0%
yes we are
 
02:11:47.990 --> 02:11:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:50.470 --> 02:11:50.480 align:start position:0%
any addition yes representative majori
 
02:11:52.390 --> 02:11:52.400 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
02:11:54.550 --> 02:11:54.560 align:start position:0%
in the effort to treat like things alike
 
02:11:56.950 --> 02:11:56.960 align:start position:0%
we we've spent uh quite a bit of time on
 
02:11:58.790 --> 02:11:58.800 align:start position:0%
other bills trying to make sure that
 
02:12:00.550 --> 02:12:00.560 align:start position:0%
language comports and
 
02:12:02.709 --> 02:12:02.719 align:start position:0%
we're trying to we're trying to make
 
02:12:04.870 --> 02:12:04.880 align:start position:0%
nashua have a two-thirds majority to
 
02:12:06.550 --> 02:12:06.560 align:start position:0%
override something which is kind of
 
02:12:08.950 --> 02:12:08.960 align:start position:0%
restrictive and they want that
 
02:12:11.270 --> 02:12:11.280 align:start position:0%
just so that we have clarity i'm all in
 
02:12:13.430 --> 02:12:13.440 align:start position:0%
favor of that
 
02:12:14.629 --> 02:12:14.639 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:12:16.550 --> 02:12:16.560 align:start position:0%
representative tripp
 
02:12:18.950 --> 02:12:18.960 align:start position:0%
i guess i have a question
 
02:12:22.790 --> 02:12:22.800 align:start position:0%
why is it that every other town
 
02:12:27.350 --> 02:12:27.360 align:start position:0%
has an override capability except nashua
 
02:12:29.189 --> 02:12:29.199 align:start position:0%
representative can you tackle that oh
 
02:12:31.510 --> 02:12:31.520 align:start position:0%
absolutely um and and i'd love to tackle
 
02:12:35.030 --> 02:12:35.040 align:start position:0%
it this was one of those um
 
02:12:36.629 --> 02:12:36.639 align:start position:0%
i don't want to call it community i'll
 
02:12:38.790 --> 02:12:38.800 align:start position:0%
call it a citizen
 
02:12:42.149 --> 02:12:42.159 align:start position:0%
charter this was one of the um
 
02:12:42.159 --> 02:12:42.950 align:start position:0%
charter this was one of the um
the

02:12:42.950 --> 02:12:42.960 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:12:45.750 --> 02:12:45.760 align:start position:0%
citizens groups that got together
 
02:12:48.149 --> 02:12:48.159 align:start position:0%
and got all the signatures that needed
 
02:12:50.229 --> 02:12:50.239 align:start position:0%
to get a ballot question
 
02:12:53.109 --> 02:12:53.119 align:start position:0%
and when you do that and they write the
 
02:12:53.119 --> 02:12:54.149 align:start position:0%
and when you do that and they write the
question

02:12:54.149 --> 02:12:54.159 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:12:56.470 --> 02:12:56.480 align:start position:0%
and they were very specific about how
 
02:12:59.189 --> 02:12:59.199 align:start position:0%
they wrote it and so on and it passes
 
02:13:01.430 --> 02:13:01.440 align:start position:0%
you must put it in the charter as
 
02:13:01.440 --> 02:13:03.510 align:start position:0%
you must put it in the charter as
written

02:13:03.510 --> 02:13:03.520 align:start position:0%
written
 
02:13:05.510 --> 02:13:05.520 align:start position:0%
so in order to make any changes to it
 
02:13:07.189 --> 02:13:07.199 align:start position:0%
you have to do another charter change
 
02:13:08.629 --> 02:13:08.639 align:start position:0%
etc so
 
02:13:10.229 --> 02:13:10.239 align:start position:0%
it was not written
 
02:13:12.709 --> 02:13:12.719 align:start position:0%
by the city of nashua it was written by
 
02:13:14.790 --> 02:13:14.800 align:start position:0%
the citizens group and an override
 
02:13:17.990 --> 02:13:18.000 align:start position:0%
provision was not put into it so i hope
 
02:13:19.109 --> 02:13:19.119 align:start position:0%
that answers your question
 
02:13:19.119 --> 02:13:25.109 align:start position:0%
that answers your question
representative

02:13:25.109 --> 02:13:25.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:28.709 --> 02:13:28.719 align:start position:0%
yes it seems that this this
 
02:13:28.719 --> 02:13:30.870 align:start position:0%
yes it seems that this this
cap

02:13:30.870 --> 02:13:30.880 align:start position:0%
cap
 
02:13:30.880 --> 02:13:32.069 align:start position:0%
cap
was

02:13:32.069 --> 02:13:32.079 align:start position:0%
was
 
02:13:32.079 --> 02:13:33.990 align:start position:0%
was
instituted

02:13:33.990 --> 02:13:34.000 align:start position:0%
instituted
 
02:13:36.870 --> 02:13:36.880 align:start position:0%
based upon a referendum
 
02:13:40.629 --> 02:13:40.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:40.639 --> 02:13:41.510 align:start position:0%
 
then

02:13:41.510 --> 02:13:41.520 align:start position:0%
then
 
02:13:45.910 --> 02:13:45.920 align:start position:0%
i feel that to make changes to that
 
02:13:45.920 --> 02:13:46.709 align:start position:0%
i feel that to make changes to that
to

02:13:46.709 --> 02:13:46.719 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:13:49.830 --> 02:13:49.840 align:start position:0%
override this cap
 
02:13:49.840 --> 02:13:50.709 align:start position:0%
override this cap
should

02:13:50.709 --> 02:13:50.719 align:start position:0%
should
 
02:13:50.719 --> 02:13:52.149 align:start position:0%
should
also

02:13:52.149 --> 02:13:52.159 align:start position:0%
also
 
02:13:52.159 --> 02:13:53.669 align:start position:0%
also
require

02:13:53.669 --> 02:13:53.679 align:start position:0%
require
 
02:13:56.069 --> 02:13:56.079 align:start position:0%
a referendum
 
02:13:59.030 --> 02:13:59.040 align:start position:0%
to change the tax cap
 
02:14:00.470 --> 02:14:00.480 align:start position:0%
to to
 
02:14:02.310 --> 02:14:02.320 align:start position:0%
implement even though it's a super
 
02:14:05.669 --> 02:14:05.679 align:start position:0%
majority and i understand my colleague
 
02:14:05.679 --> 02:14:07.350 align:start position:0%
majority and i understand my colleague
majori

02:14:07.350 --> 02:14:07.360 align:start position:0%
majori
 
02:14:10.629 --> 02:14:10.639 align:start position:0%
was talking about a two-thirds vote but
 
02:14:12.470 --> 02:14:12.480 align:start position:0%
it's a two-thirds vote
 
02:14:15.270 --> 02:14:15.280 align:start position:0%
of the alderman it's not a two-thirds
 
02:14:15.280 --> 02:14:16.310 align:start position:0%
of the alderman it's not a two-thirds
vote

02:14:16.310 --> 02:14:16.320 align:start position:0%
vote
 
02:14:18.790 --> 02:14:18.800 align:start position:0%
of all the citizens
 
02:14:21.510 --> 02:14:21.520 align:start position:0%
so if we're going to institute
 
02:14:24.629 --> 02:14:24.639 align:start position:0%
a major change and and having an
 
02:14:24.639 --> 02:14:26.390 align:start position:0%
a major change and and having an
override

02:14:26.390 --> 02:14:26.400 align:start position:0%
override
 
02:14:29.669 --> 02:14:29.679 align:start position:0%
to this is a major change
 
02:14:32.790 --> 02:14:32.800 align:start position:0%
then i think it needs to go back
 
02:14:34.870 --> 02:14:34.880 align:start position:0%
to a referendum
 
02:14:38.629 --> 02:14:38.639 align:start position:0%
that's just my personal feeling
 
02:14:41.910 --> 02:14:41.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:44.390 --> 02:14:44.400 align:start position:0%
yes representative uh
 
02:14:45.750 --> 02:14:45.760 align:start position:0%
another question
 
02:14:48.069 --> 02:14:48.079 align:start position:0%
oh what wait a minute uh representative
 
02:14:48.079 --> 02:14:48.870 align:start position:0%
oh what wait a minute uh representative
troop

02:14:48.870 --> 02:14:48.880 align:start position:0%
troop
 
02:14:53.430 --> 02:14:53.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:55.510 --> 02:14:55.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:14:57.669 --> 02:14:57.679 align:start position:0%
i'm not trying to muddy any waters and
 
02:14:59.430 --> 02:14:59.440 align:start position:0%
certainly anybody
 
02:15:01.669 --> 02:15:01.679 align:start position:0%
who's also from nashville can clarify
 
02:15:04.550 --> 02:15:04.560 align:start position:0%
this i was on the school board in nashua
 
02:15:08.149 --> 02:15:08.159 align:start position:0%
when this went in it's a spending cap
 
02:15:10.229 --> 02:15:10.239 align:start position:0%
not a tax cap
 
02:15:13.270 --> 02:15:13.280 align:start position:0%
and one of the illustrations that one of
 
02:15:16.470 --> 02:15:16.480 align:start position:0%
our aldermen made at the time and and i
 
02:15:18.950 --> 02:15:18.960 align:start position:0%
respect the fact yep it was voted on and
 
02:15:18.960 --> 02:15:20.390 align:start position:0%
respect the fact yep it was voted on and
whatever

02:15:20.390 --> 02:15:20.400 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
02:15:23.189 --> 02:15:23.199 align:start position:0%
there was a an illustration that
 
02:15:25.350 --> 02:15:25.360 align:start position:0%
with a spending cap
 
02:15:27.510 --> 02:15:27.520 align:start position:0%
you could literally bond and get a
 
02:15:30.390 --> 02:15:30.400 align:start position:0%
school built but you could not afford
 
02:15:33.350 --> 02:15:33.360 align:start position:0%
because of spending cap restrictions you
 
02:15:35.830 --> 02:15:35.840 align:start position:0%
might not be able to outfit the school
 
02:15:39.430 --> 02:15:39.440 align:start position:0%
with desks chairs whatever so
 
02:15:42.550 --> 02:15:42.560 align:start position:0%
there was some awareness that it was
 
02:15:42.560 --> 02:15:44.790 align:start position:0%
there was some awareness that it was
problematic

02:15:44.790 --> 02:15:44.800 align:start position:0%
problematic
 
02:15:46.790 --> 02:15:46.800 align:start position:0%
it got to be
 
02:15:49.669 --> 02:15:49.679 align:start position:0%
as as representative earlier said though
 
02:15:51.750 --> 02:15:51.760 align:start position:0%
people responded to
 
02:15:54.310 --> 02:15:54.320 align:start position:0%
understanding that their taxes
 
02:15:56.550 --> 02:15:56.560 align:start position:0%
would be limited and that's what they
 
02:15:58.229 --> 02:15:58.239 align:start position:0%
responded to
 
02:16:00.709 --> 02:16:00.719 align:start position:0%
and the override provision
 
02:16:00.719 --> 02:16:01.589 align:start position:0%
and the override provision
that

02:16:01.589 --> 02:16:01.599 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:16:03.430 --> 02:16:03.440 align:start position:0%
frankly when i was on the school board
 
02:16:06.229 --> 02:16:06.239 align:start position:0%
way back then i thought we had one
 
02:16:08.870 --> 02:16:08.880 align:start position:0%
and there were instances when
 
02:16:10.870 --> 02:16:10.880 align:start position:0%
10 aldermen would
 
02:16:13.750 --> 02:16:13.760 align:start position:0%
quote override
 
02:16:15.669 --> 02:16:15.679 align:start position:0%
but i would
 
02:16:17.589 --> 02:16:17.599 align:start position:0%
really i think we need this to clear
 
02:16:19.589 --> 02:16:19.599 align:start position:0%
things up in nashua thank you thank you
 
02:16:21.589 --> 02:16:21.599 align:start position:0%
representative newman
 
02:16:24.229 --> 02:16:24.239 align:start position:0%
yes representative gilman
 
02:16:26.709 --> 02:16:26.719 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i i would
 
02:16:28.629 --> 02:16:28.639 align:start position:0%
i want to thank the representative for
 
02:16:30.069 --> 02:16:30.079 align:start position:0%
bringing up the difference between the
 
02:16:32.870 --> 02:16:32.880 align:start position:0%
spending cap and the tax cap i believe
 
02:16:34.230 --> 02:16:34.240 align:start position:0%
in this
 
02:16:37.110 --> 02:16:37.120 align:start position:0%
legislation the only time a spending cap
 
02:16:41.030 --> 02:16:41.040 align:start position:0%
is referred to is on number line four
 
02:16:43.190 --> 02:16:43.200 align:start position:0%
and the rest of it all has to do with
 
02:16:45.669 --> 02:16:45.679 align:start position:0%
tax caps
 
02:16:48.230 --> 02:16:48.240 align:start position:0%
so i would argue that this legislation
 
02:16:50.389 --> 02:16:50.399 align:start position:0%
would be ineffective
 
02:16:50.399 --> 02:16:51.669 align:start position:0%
would be ineffective
because

02:16:51.669 --> 02:16:51.679 align:start position:0%
because
 
02:16:53.030 --> 02:16:53.040 align:start position:0%
it doesn't
 
02:16:55.110 --> 02:16:55.120 align:start position:0%
all the details of what you can do with
 
02:16:57.110 --> 02:16:57.120 align:start position:0%
the tax cap are not included with what
 
02:16:59.270 --> 02:16:59.280 align:start position:0%
you can do with the
 
02:17:02.150 --> 02:17:02.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:03.990 --> 02:17:04.000 align:start position:0%
representative clean
 
02:17:07.429 --> 02:17:07.439 align:start position:0%
uh thank you i'd like to address um
 
02:17:10.629 --> 02:17:10.639 align:start position:0%
representative los alas um i i don't
 
02:17:13.190 --> 02:17:13.200 align:start position:0%
disagree with you that um
 
02:17:15.030 --> 02:17:15.040 align:start position:0%
you know this should possibly at one
 
02:17:17.429 --> 02:17:17.439 align:start position:0%
point go back to the people the problem
 
02:17:20.790 --> 02:17:20.800 align:start position:0%
is we're here and we're now in sb 52
 
02:17:22.870 --> 02:17:22.880 align:start position:0%
past last year
 
02:17:25.509 --> 02:17:25.519 align:start position:0%
um we don't have time to get a ballot
 
02:17:26.950 --> 02:17:26.960 align:start position:0%
question now we're looking at two years
 
02:17:29.830 --> 02:17:29.840 align:start position:0%
we didn't have time once sb 52
 
02:17:31.910 --> 02:17:31.920 align:start position:0%
passed to get it on that particular
 
02:17:34.070 --> 02:17:34.080 align:start position:0%
election the next election coming
 
02:17:36.230 --> 02:17:36.240 align:start position:0%
through it will be a
 
02:17:38.150 --> 02:17:38.160 align:start position:0%
federal election and not a municipal
 
02:17:40.230 --> 02:17:40.240 align:start position:0%
election so we can't get it there we're
 
02:17:42.389 --> 02:17:42.399 align:start position:0%
looking at two more years of having to
 
02:17:43.589 --> 02:17:43.599 align:start position:0%
deal with this
 
02:17:45.830 --> 02:17:45.840 align:start position:0%
and um i have anxiety as to what those
 
02:17:47.509 --> 02:17:47.519 align:start position:0%
two years should do
 
02:17:49.110 --> 02:17:49.120 align:start position:0%
i have brought up the fact that we
 
02:17:51.190 --> 02:17:51.200 align:start position:0%
probably do need to implement the
 
02:17:53.429 --> 02:17:53.439 align:start position:0%
charter change and we do need to put a
 
02:17:56.150 --> 02:17:56.160 align:start position:0%
referendum on the ballot so i don't
 
02:17:58.389 --> 02:17:58.399 align:start position:0%
disagree with you but we're here we're
 
02:18:01.910 --> 02:18:01.920 align:start position:0%
now and we've got two more years plus
 
02:18:04.070 --> 02:18:04.080 align:start position:0%
of what this possibly could do to the
 
02:18:05.589 --> 02:18:05.599 align:start position:0%
city of nashua and
 
02:18:08.230 --> 02:18:08.240 align:start position:0%
i saw what it did in the past and now
 
02:18:10.709 --> 02:18:10.719 align:start position:0%
that we really do not have override even
 
02:18:13.429 --> 02:18:13.439 align:start position:0%
though we may have done it in the past
 
02:18:16.549 --> 02:18:16.559 align:start position:0%
we would be remiss if we openly did it
 
02:18:16.559 --> 02:18:17.429 align:start position:0%
we would be remiss if we openly did it
now

02:18:17.429 --> 02:18:17.439 align:start position:0%
now
 
02:18:19.190 --> 02:18:19.200 align:start position:0%
knowing what the supreme court has said
 
02:18:21.589 --> 02:18:21.599 align:start position:0%
that we do not have this so
 
02:18:23.349 --> 02:18:23.359 align:start position:0%
again i appreciate your time and thank
 
02:18:25.830 --> 02:18:25.840 align:start position:0%
you so much for indulging me i i know
 
02:18:27.349 --> 02:18:27.359 align:start position:0%
there's some urgency to call the
 
02:18:29.110 --> 02:18:29.120 align:start position:0%
question but i'm going to allow
 
02:18:30.870 --> 02:18:30.880 align:start position:0%
two more speakers and then then we're
 
02:18:34.790 --> 02:18:34.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:36.870 --> 02:18:36.880 align:start position:0%
i withdraw
 
02:18:40.150 --> 02:18:40.160 align:start position:0%
yes representatives davis
 
02:18:42.469 --> 02:18:42.479 align:start position:0%
so um
 
02:18:44.230 --> 02:18:44.240 align:start position:0%
with gratitude to my colleague
 
02:18:46.070 --> 02:18:46.080 align:start position:0%
representative majori refreshed my
 
02:18:48.070 --> 02:18:48.080 align:start position:0%
memory on how we voted
 
02:18:50.709 --> 02:18:50.719 align:start position:0%
on hb 1081
 
02:18:54.309 --> 02:18:54.319 align:start position:0%
which was to um not require
 
02:18:56.629 --> 02:18:56.639 align:start position:0%
a two-thirds majority to dissolve a
 
02:18:59.030 --> 02:18:59.040 align:start position:0%
village district but let it go
 
02:19:00.870 --> 02:19:00.880 align:start position:0%
at a
 
02:19:02.469 --> 02:19:02.479 align:start position:0%
simple majority
 
02:19:06.150 --> 02:19:06.160 align:start position:0%
so in that case we were comfortable
 
02:19:07.910 --> 02:19:07.920 align:start position:0%
with the simple majority in this case
 
02:19:11.030 --> 02:19:11.040 align:start position:0%
we're insisting on a super majority
 
02:19:13.589 --> 02:19:13.599 align:start position:0%
can somebody point out to me the logic
 
02:19:14.870 --> 02:19:14.880 align:start position:0%
in that
 
02:19:17.270 --> 02:19:17.280 align:start position:0%
they want to tackle that question
 
02:19:19.429 --> 02:19:19.439 align:start position:0%
i'll tackle that
 
02:19:22.150 --> 02:19:22.160 align:start position:0%
with the village district
 
02:19:22.160 --> 02:19:23.669 align:start position:0%
with the village district
issue

02:19:23.669 --> 02:19:23.679 align:start position:0%
issue
 
02:19:26.469 --> 02:19:26.479 align:start position:0%
it's a simple majority to form a village
 
02:19:26.479 --> 02:19:28.870 align:start position:0%
it's a simple majority to form a village
district

02:19:28.870 --> 02:19:28.880 align:start position:0%
district
 
02:19:28.880 --> 02:19:29.990 align:start position:0%
district
and

02:19:29.990 --> 02:19:30.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:19:32.790 --> 02:19:32.800 align:start position:0%
i don't see why you would require a
 
02:19:35.270 --> 02:19:35.280 align:start position:0%
super majority to dissolve it
 
02:19:35.280 --> 02:19:36.230 align:start position:0%
super majority to dissolve it
and

02:19:36.230 --> 02:19:36.240 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:19:38.549 --> 02:19:38.559 align:start position:0%
since i spoke to that previously if you
 
02:19:40.629 --> 02:19:40.639 align:start position:0%
give me some time i can find
 
02:19:41.910 --> 02:19:41.920 align:start position:0%
where uh
 
02:19:41.920 --> 02:19:44.389 align:start position:0%
where uh
that

02:19:44.389 --> 02:19:44.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:46.389 --> 02:19:46.399 align:start position:0%
resides in in the
 
02:19:46.399 --> 02:19:47.190 align:start position:0%
resides in in the
law

02:19:47.190 --> 02:19:47.200 align:start position:0%
law
 
02:19:48.790 --> 02:19:48.800 align:start position:0%
if you're if you
 
02:19:51.910 --> 02:19:51.920 align:start position:0%
you only have about 60 seconds
 
02:19:54.469 --> 02:19:54.479 align:start position:0%
are people interested in and why
 
02:19:57.510 --> 02:19:57.520 align:start position:0%
it's only a simple majority to form a
 
02:19:58.950 --> 02:19:58.960 align:start position:0%
village district
 
02:20:00.950 --> 02:20:00.960 align:start position:0%
i think we're getting close to being
 
02:20:15.110 --> 02:20:15.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:18.230 --> 02:20:18.240 align:start position:0%
house available 1342 and i appreciate
 
02:20:18.240 --> 02:20:19.270 align:start position:0%
house available 1342 and i appreciate
your

02:20:19.270 --> 02:20:19.280 align:start position:0%
your
 
02:20:21.429 --> 02:20:21.439 align:start position:0%
your indulgence as we had to went to
 
02:20:23.830 --> 02:20:23.840 align:start position:0%
research and went to an attorney
 
02:20:25.429 --> 02:20:25.439 align:start position:0%
and i think we've got this thoroughly
 
02:20:28.550 --> 02:20:28.560 align:start position:0%
covered and spoken to so i'm going to
 
02:20:28.560 --> 02:20:30.630 align:start position:0%
covered and spoken to so i'm going to
ask

02:20:30.630 --> 02:20:30.640 align:start position:0%
ask
 
02:20:31.670 --> 02:20:31.680 align:start position:0%
the clerk
 
02:20:33.670 --> 02:20:33.680 align:start position:0%
to call the question i'm going to remind
 
02:20:36.469 --> 02:20:36.479 align:start position:0%
all of us that this is an itl
 
02:20:40.469 --> 02:20:40.479 align:start position:0%

02:20:42.309 --> 02:20:42.319 align:start position:0%

02:22:55.270 --> 02:22:55.280 align:start position:0%
mr chair i'd like to make a motion
 
02:22:57.349 --> 02:22:57.359 align:start position:0%
interest interim study
 
02:23:00.630 --> 02:23:00.640 align:start position:0%
for bill 1342 1342
 
02:23:03.990 --> 02:23:04.000 align:start position:0%
is there a second for that
 
02:23:06.630 --> 02:23:06.640 align:start position:0%
motion's been made and seconded
 
02:23:08.389 --> 02:23:08.399 align:start position:0%
is there any discussion at this point
 
02:23:08.399 --> 02:23:11.030 align:start position:0%
is there any discussion at this point
yes

02:23:11.030 --> 02:23:11.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:12.790 --> 02:23:12.800 align:start position:0%
thank you and i hope this doesn't mean
 
02:23:14.309 --> 02:23:14.319 align:start position:0%
that i don't get to vote
 
02:23:14.319 --> 02:23:16.309 align:start position:0%
that i don't get to vote
um

02:23:16.309 --> 02:23:16.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:23:18.469 --> 02:23:18.479 align:start position:0%
my firm belief and i think it was even
 
02:23:20.309 --> 02:23:20.319 align:start position:0%
mentioned here by a representative who
 
02:23:22.550 --> 02:23:22.560 align:start position:0%
filled in in the past that an interim
 
02:23:25.510 --> 02:23:25.520 align:start position:0%
study is equivalent to an itl
 
02:23:27.750 --> 02:23:27.760 align:start position:0%
um that it will go nowhere and that it
 
02:23:29.590 --> 02:23:29.600 align:start position:0%
would possibly die and i don't mean to
 
02:23:32.630 --> 02:23:32.640 align:start position:0%
be critical um it's just a concern that
 
02:23:34.710 --> 02:23:34.720 align:start position:0%
i have i think this is something that
 
02:23:36.630 --> 02:23:36.640 align:start position:0%
needs to be addressed and it needs to be
 
02:23:39.510 --> 02:23:39.520 align:start position:0%
fixed so i would hope that we will vote
 
02:23:42.070 --> 02:23:42.080 align:start position:0%
against an interim study thank you
 
02:23:43.670 --> 02:23:43.680 align:start position:0%
further discussion yes representative
 
02:23:43.680 --> 02:23:44.870 align:start position:0%
further discussion yes representative
power

02:23:44.870 --> 02:23:44.880 align:start position:0%
power
 
02:23:47.190 --> 02:23:47.200 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um
 
02:23:49.750 --> 02:23:49.760 align:start position:0%
my comments would be this is in fact
 
02:23:52.070 --> 02:23:52.080 align:start position:0%
it's a complicated issue
 
02:23:54.389 --> 02:23:54.399 align:start position:0%
this this bill is
 
02:23:54.399 --> 02:23:55.830 align:start position:0%
this this bill is
curious

02:23:55.830 --> 02:23:55.840 align:start position:0%
curious
 
02:23:58.870 --> 02:23:58.880 align:start position:0%
we had sb 52 that came through this
 
02:24:00.870 --> 02:24:00.880 align:start position:0%
committee last year was signed into law
 
02:24:00.880 --> 02:24:02.230 align:start position:0%
committee last year was signed into law
so

02:24:02.230 --> 02:24:02.240 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:24:05.190 --> 02:24:05.200 align:start position:0%
all totaled this is a complex issue and
 
02:24:06.950 --> 02:24:06.960 align:start position:0%
my concerns are that there have been
 
02:24:09.349 --> 02:24:09.359 align:start position:0%
comments which in in my understanding
 
02:24:11.830 --> 02:24:11.840 align:start position:0%
are just not accurate so
 
02:24:15.990 --> 02:24:16.000 align:start position:0%
for those reasons i i i'm uncomfortable
 
02:24:17.670 --> 02:24:17.680 align:start position:0%
passing something that that's
 
02:24:20.550 --> 02:24:20.560 align:start position:0%
problematic in in my estimation so
 
02:24:23.270 --> 02:24:23.280 align:start position:0%
i i would support an interim study
 
02:24:24.710 --> 02:24:24.720 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
02:24:27.030 --> 02:24:27.040 align:start position:0%
representative run
 
02:24:28.710 --> 02:24:28.720 align:start position:0%
yeah i mean
 
02:24:31.429 --> 02:24:31.439 align:start position:0%
we've voted on ought to pass on many
 
02:24:35.670 --> 02:24:35.680 align:start position:0%
bills that were a lot more vague
 
02:24:37.910 --> 02:24:37.920 align:start position:0%
and um
 
02:24:39.590 --> 02:24:39.600 align:start position:0%
if i could ask you to hold on a minute
 
02:24:41.590 --> 02:24:41.600 align:start position:0%
representative got cool to get you to
 
02:24:44.309 --> 02:24:44.319 align:start position:0%
click off your microphone okay
 
02:24:45.510 --> 02:24:45.520 align:start position:0%
i just think this is pretty
 
02:24:49.190 --> 02:24:49.200 align:start position:0%
straightforward um i think nashua and
 
02:24:52.469 --> 02:24:52.479 align:start position:0%
any community that has
 
02:24:55.429 --> 02:24:55.439 align:start position:0%
a cap needs to have an override
 
02:24:55.439 --> 02:24:56.870 align:start position:0%
a cap needs to have an override
provision

02:24:56.870 --> 02:24:56.880 align:start position:0%
provision
 
02:24:58.790 --> 02:24:58.800 align:start position:0%
the last thing we want to do is delay
 
02:25:01.670 --> 02:25:01.680 align:start position:0%
this i think we should just just
 
02:25:04.469 --> 02:25:04.479 align:start position:0%
vote no on the interim study so that
 
02:25:06.790 --> 02:25:06.800 align:start position:0%
another motion can be made and we can
 
02:25:09.910 --> 02:25:09.920 align:start position:0%
get this into statute thank you thank
 
02:25:13.670 --> 02:25:13.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:14.790 --> 02:25:14.800 align:start position:0%
seeing none
 
02:25:16.389 --> 02:25:16.399 align:start position:0%
we'll ask oh
 
02:25:18.309 --> 02:25:18.319 align:start position:0%
yes representative guthrie
 
02:25:21.110 --> 02:25:21.120 align:start position:0%
i just like to explain somewhat why i
 
02:25:22.389 --> 02:25:22.399 align:start position:0%
voted no
 
02:25:24.550 --> 02:25:24.560 align:start position:0%
and that i don't think it should go into
 
02:25:27.349 --> 02:25:27.359 align:start position:0%
an interim study we have a member of our
 
02:25:29.670 --> 02:25:29.680 align:start position:0%
committee from the uh
 
02:25:31.990 --> 02:25:32.000 align:start position:0%
town that has a problem our city has a
 
02:25:34.710 --> 02:25:34.720 align:start position:0%
problem i think we ought to have the
 
02:25:37.190 --> 02:25:37.200 align:start position:0%
bill go forward let the senate take a
 
02:25:40.309 --> 02:25:40.319 align:start position:0%
look at it and i just think they ought
 
02:25:42.630 --> 02:25:42.640 align:start position:0%
to have an opportunity to move this bill
 
02:25:45.510 --> 02:25:45.520 align:start position:0%
along i don't know enough about it i am
 
02:25:47.349 --> 02:25:47.359 align:start position:0%
voting in the dark but it wouldn't be
 
02:25:49.349 --> 02:25:49.359 align:start position:0%
the first time thank you
 
02:25:50.870 --> 02:25:50.880 align:start position:0%

02:26:00.309 --> 02:26:00.319 align:start position:0%
their their charter if that is in fact
 
02:26:01.830 --> 02:26:01.840 align:start position:0%
