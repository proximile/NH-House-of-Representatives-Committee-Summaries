for those in the audience just to let
 
00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:26.880 align:start position:0%

some copies of stuff so just give us a
 
00:12:37.550 --> 00:12:37.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:41.750 --> 00:12:41.760 align:start position:0%
all right um I'm going to call the uh
 
00:12:44.090 --> 00:12:44.100 align:start position:0%
executive session of the house Judiciary
 
00:12:45.470 --> 00:12:45.480 align:start position:0%
Committee to order and I'm going to
 
00:12:47.329 --> 00:12:47.339 align:start position:0%
first recognize representative Alexander
 
00:12:50.509 --> 00:12:50.519 align:start position:0%
to lead us in the Pledge of Allegiance
 
00:12:50.519 --> 00:13:12.290 align:start position:0%
to lead us in the Pledge of Allegiance
foreign

00:13:12.290 --> 00:13:12.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:13.550 --> 00:13:13.560 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:13:15.889 --> 00:13:15.899 align:start position:0%
um so the first matter on for
 
00:13:20.090 --> 00:13:20.100 align:start position:0%
consideration is SB 27 relative to
 
00:13:23.030 --> 00:13:23.040 align:start position:0%
financial disclosure forms filed by
 
00:13:26.449 --> 00:13:26.459 align:start position:0%
judges and I'm going to uh recognize
 
00:13:29.629 --> 00:13:29.639 align:start position:0%
representative Perez for emotion
 
00:13:33.470 --> 00:13:33.480 align:start position:0%
thank you I would like to move Senate
 
00:13:37.009 --> 00:13:37.019 align:start position:0%
Bill 27 as it exists for ought to pass
 
00:13:42.110 --> 00:13:42.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:43.670 --> 00:13:43.680 align:start position:0%
been made in seconds
 
00:13:45.829 --> 00:13:45.839 align:start position:0%
um is representative Perez would you
 
00:13:47.269 --> 00:13:47.279 align:start position:0%
like to speak to the motion or I'm not
 
00:13:49.069 --> 00:13:49.079 align:start position:0%
sure if it needs to be but you're more
 
00:13:51.829 --> 00:13:51.839 align:start position:0%
than welcome to if you wish to
 
00:13:54.430 --> 00:13:54.440 align:start position:0%
it eliminates some paperwork
 
00:13:57.350 --> 00:13:57.360 align:start position:0%
and makes life a little easier
 
00:13:58.970 --> 00:13:58.980 align:start position:0%
no no that's right and you know I guess
 
00:14:00.590 --> 00:14:00.600 align:start position:0%
I would just follow up on that a little
 
00:14:02.150 --> 00:14:02.160 align:start position:0%
bit I think
 
00:14:03.889 --> 00:14:03.899 align:start position:0%
um when I was still on the in the
 
00:14:07.190 --> 00:14:07.200 align:start position:0%
judicial branch I uh I was appointed to
 
00:14:09.650 --> 00:14:09.660 align:start position:0%
serve on a number of of committees that
 
00:14:12.470 --> 00:14:12.480 align:start position:0%
of executive branch and or legislative
 
00:14:16.250 --> 00:14:16.260 align:start position:0%
executive and and got uh and although I
 
00:14:17.810 --> 00:14:17.820 align:start position:0%
had filed a judicial branch Financial
 
00:14:19.550 --> 00:14:19.560 align:start position:0%
disclosure form it was always a question
 
00:14:22.069 --> 00:14:22.079 align:start position:0%
of whether or not I had to file this
 
00:14:24.350 --> 00:14:24.360 align:start position:0%
additional one I think I think I
 
00:14:26.690 --> 00:14:26.700 align:start position:0%
normally did it because I wanted just
 
00:14:28.129 --> 00:14:28.139 align:start position:0%
out of an abundance of caution and I
 
00:14:29.569 --> 00:14:29.579 align:start position:0%
think other judges did the same thing
 
00:14:31.009 --> 00:14:31.019 align:start position:0%
but I'm not sure that all of them did
 
00:14:32.750 --> 00:14:32.760 align:start position:0%
and there definitely was some confusion
 
00:14:34.790 --> 00:14:34.800 align:start position:0%
I can remember having conversations with
 
00:14:37.490 --> 00:14:37.500 align:start position:0%
uh uh Bill Gardner about you know do I
 
00:14:39.949 --> 00:14:39.959 align:start position:0%
have to do this for this or not so I
 
00:14:42.470 --> 00:14:42.480 align:start position:0%
just think this kind of uh
 
00:14:44.750 --> 00:14:44.760 align:start position:0%
it eliminates paperwork and since the
 
00:14:47.090 --> 00:14:47.100 align:start position:0%
judicial form actually requires more
 
00:14:49.370 --> 00:14:49.380 align:start position:0%
information than than the legislative
 
00:14:51.170 --> 00:14:51.180 align:start position:0%
form I don't think there's a problem so
 
00:14:53.150 --> 00:14:53.160 align:start position:0%
I think it's a good idea
 
00:14:55.730 --> 00:14:55.740 align:start position:0%
um any any further discussion on this
 
00:14:58.129 --> 00:14:58.139 align:start position:0%
are we ready for a vote
 
00:15:00.350 --> 00:15:00.360 align:start position:0%
all right then I guess I'd ask the clerk
 
00:15:03.350 --> 00:15:03.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:06.290 --> 00:15:06.300 align:start position:0%

director of charitable trusts and the
 
00:16:31.970 --> 00:16:31.980 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes uh representative
 
00:16:35.090 --> 00:16:35.100 align:start position:0%
Alexander thank you Mr chair I move
 
00:16:39.249 --> 00:16:39.259 align:start position:0%
OTP and move Amendment uh
 
00:16:43.129 --> 00:16:43.139 align:start position:0%
2023-1404 H right there a second
 
00:16:47.930 --> 00:16:47.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:50.269 --> 00:16:50.279 align:start position:0%
yes speak to your Amendment yes so um
 
00:16:51.530 --> 00:16:51.540 align:start position:0%
this amendment
 
00:16:51.540 --> 00:16:53.509 align:start position:0%
this amendment
um

00:16:53.509 --> 00:16:53.519 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:57.050 --> 00:16:57.060 align:start position:0%
is a I I believe it will help strengthen
 
00:16:59.990 --> 00:17:00.000 align:start position:0%
the bills so the bill as it is uh
 
00:17:02.389 --> 00:17:02.399 align:start position:0%
removes the physical location and the
 
00:17:04.970 --> 00:17:04.980 align:start position:0%
Attorney General had no problem
 
00:17:04.980 --> 00:17:07.189 align:start position:0%
Attorney General had no problem
um

00:17:07.189 --> 00:17:07.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:09.350 --> 00:17:09.360 align:start position:0%
the reason for the physical location in
 
00:17:13.490 --> 00:17:13.500 align:start position:0%
the argument is it was archaic or like
 
00:17:15.110 --> 00:17:15.120 align:start position:0%
there was really no reason to have a
 
00:17:17.449 --> 00:17:17.459 align:start position:0%
meeting necessary at the state house
 
00:17:19.549 --> 00:17:19.559 align:start position:0%
um but I did see the Merit in having a
 
00:17:22.189 --> 00:17:22.199 align:start position:0%
physical Location meeting if the person
 
00:17:24.289 --> 00:17:24.299 align:start position:0%
being investigated would like it so this
 
00:17:27.230 --> 00:17:27.240 align:start position:0%
amendment basically would allow any any
 
00:17:29.990 --> 00:17:30.000 align:start position:0%
person or all these other people
 
00:17:32.330 --> 00:17:32.340 align:start position:0%
um that are being investigated to have a
 
00:17:34.669 --> 00:17:34.679 align:start position:0%
a right to have an appearance in a
 
00:17:36.289 --> 00:17:36.299 align:start position:0%
physical location but it still gives the
 
00:17:38.390 --> 00:17:38.400 align:start position:0%
Attorney General the opportunity to
 
00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:39.830 align:start position:0%
Attorney General the opportunity to
determine

00:17:39.830 --> 00:17:39.840 align:start position:0%
determine
 
00:17:42.049 --> 00:17:42.059 align:start position:0%
um the actual location so I believe it
 
00:17:43.850 --> 00:17:43.860 align:start position:0%
will strengthen the bill
 
00:17:46.610 --> 00:17:46.620 align:start position:0%
um removing the at the State House in
 
00:17:48.830 --> 00:17:48.840 align:start position:0%
the original bill
 
00:17:50.870 --> 00:17:50.880 align:start position:0%
um we'll remove the
 
00:17:52.669 --> 00:17:52.679 align:start position:0%
the requirement that's at the state
 
00:17:54.770 --> 00:17:54.780 align:start position:0%
house but I believe adding in my
 
00:17:56.390 --> 00:17:56.400 align:start position:0%
Amendment will allow the person being
 
00:17:58.190 --> 00:17:58.200 align:start position:0%
investigated to have a physical meeting
 
00:18:01.070 --> 00:18:01.080 align:start position:0%
and um the reason why I believe that
 
00:18:03.950 --> 00:18:03.960 align:start position:0%
this is important is because
 
00:18:05.990 --> 00:18:06.000 align:start position:0%
the Attorney General's office said that
 
00:18:08.450 --> 00:18:08.460 align:start position:0%
you know they sometimes have hearings
 
00:18:10.850 --> 00:18:10.860 align:start position:0%
over Zoom or our investigations over
 
00:18:13.730 --> 00:18:13.740 align:start position:0%
zoom and I think most people would feel
 
00:18:15.230 --> 00:18:15.240 align:start position:0%
like that is
 
00:18:18.529 --> 00:18:18.539 align:start position:0%
a valid investigation but not all people
 
00:18:20.690 --> 00:18:20.700 align:start position:0%
and I think if
 
00:18:23.990 --> 00:18:24.000 align:start position:0%
some requests that they should be
 
00:18:25.310 --> 00:18:25.320 align:start position:0%
investigating in person they should have
 
00:18:28.070 --> 00:18:28.080 align:start position:0%
a right to that right to do that so I
 
00:18:30.590 --> 00:18:30.600 align:start position:0%
just want to cover the basics and I
 
00:18:31.909 --> 00:18:31.919 align:start position:0%
think this amendment strengthens the
 
00:18:33.230 --> 00:18:33.240 align:start position:0%
bill while covers what the Attorney
 
00:18:35.630 --> 00:18:35.640 align:start position:0%
General's office wanted so I ask that
 
00:18:39.049 --> 00:18:39.059 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:40.610 --> 00:18:40.620 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry representative Smith
 
00:18:43.909 --> 00:18:43.919 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chair
 
00:18:48.409 --> 00:18:48.419 align:start position:0%
um I always prefer to agree with my
 
00:18:52.010 --> 00:18:52.020 align:start position:0%
um my colleague from Goffstown whenever
 
00:18:56.210 --> 00:18:56.220 align:start position:0%
I can which is most often and I will in
 
00:18:59.350 --> 00:18:59.360 align:start position:0%
fact agree with him on this amendment
 
00:19:01.549 --> 00:19:01.559 align:start position:0%
although I don't really believe it's
 
00:19:05.750 --> 00:19:05.760 align:start position:0%
necessary I am happy to support
 
00:19:10.070 --> 00:19:10.080 align:start position:0%

uh this is the bill uh repealing the uh
 
00:21:18.529 --> 00:21:18.539 align:start position:0%
medical screening panels and uh the
 
00:21:20.630 --> 00:21:20.640 align:start position:0%

00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:23.390 align:start position:0%

I move OTP
 
00:21:27.650 --> 00:21:27.660 align:start position:0%
for a second
 
00:21:29.810 --> 00:21:29.820 align:start position:0%
moved by representative second by
 
00:21:31.730 --> 00:21:31.740 align:start position:0%
representative Wallace representative do
 
00:21:33.890 --> 00:21:33.900 align:start position:0%
you wish to speak to your motion
 
00:21:37.490 --> 00:21:37.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:40.909 --> 00:21:40.919 align:start position:0%
it just became very clear that these
 
00:21:44.210 --> 00:21:44.220 align:start position:0%
panels aren't being used and
 
00:21:46.250 --> 00:21:46.260 align:start position:0%
after hearing all the testimony I was
 
00:21:48.230 --> 00:21:48.240 align:start position:0%
unable to even see a path forward about
 
00:21:50.570 --> 00:21:50.580 align:start position:0%
how it could even be made to work I
 
00:21:52.730 --> 00:21:52.740 align:start position:0%
think there's so
 
00:21:55.010 --> 00:21:55.020 align:start position:0%
a few Specialists and certain of these
 
00:21:58.190 --> 00:21:58.200 align:start position:0%
you know specialized
 
00:22:00.950 --> 00:22:00.960 align:start position:0%
practices that you wouldn't be able to
 
00:22:02.390 --> 00:22:02.400 align:start position:0%
find somebody that didn't have a
 
00:22:03.950 --> 00:22:03.960 align:start position:0%
conflict of interest within the state
 
00:22:08.930 --> 00:22:08.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:11.630 --> 00:22:11.640 align:start position:0%
to have and I think it was just becoming
 
00:22:15.110 --> 00:22:15.120 align:start position:0%
a wasteful if at some other point
 
00:22:17.450 --> 00:22:17.460 align:start position:0%
another idea is thought of about how to
 
00:22:19.730 --> 00:22:19.740 align:start position:0%
make something like this work I think we
 
00:22:21.169 --> 00:22:21.179 align:start position:0%
can certainly pursue it at that point
 
00:22:22.730 --> 00:22:22.740 align:start position:0%
but leaving something in that's just
 
00:22:25.010 --> 00:22:25.020 align:start position:0%
simply not working and not being used
 
00:22:26.750 --> 00:22:26.760 align:start position:0%
and hasn't done anything over the years
 
00:22:30.409 --> 00:22:30.419 align:start position:0%
to just decrease the
 
00:22:33.710 --> 00:22:33.720 align:start position:0%
amount of malpractice insurance
 
00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:36.649 align:start position:0%
amount of malpractice insurance
um

00:22:36.649 --> 00:22:36.659 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:38.570 --> 00:22:38.580 align:start position:0%
payments or anything like that then I I
 
00:22:42.049 --> 00:22:42.059 align:start position:0%
just I don't see the use in it so I um
 
00:22:43.549 --> 00:22:43.559 align:start position:0%
I think repealing it is the right thing
 
00:22:44.570 --> 00:22:44.580 align:start position:0%
to do
 
00:22:47.930 --> 00:22:47.940 align:start position:0%
anyone else wish to be heard on
 
00:22:50.510 --> 00:22:50.520 align:start position:0%
um sb65 and I guess I would just very
 
00:22:52.970 --> 00:22:52.980 align:start position:0%
briefly having been involved after the
 
00:22:55.370 --> 00:22:55.380 align:start position:0%
when the legislature first
 
00:22:57.529 --> 00:22:57.539 align:start position:0%
adopted this I was on the superior court
 
00:22:59.029 --> 00:22:59.039 align:start position:0%
and it was Superior Court that was
 
00:23:01.430 --> 00:23:01.440 align:start position:0%
charged with uh was sort of implementing
 
00:23:03.529 --> 00:23:03.539 align:start position:0%
the statute and we put in
 
00:23:05.510 --> 00:23:05.520 align:start position:0%
a great deal of work to get the system
 
00:23:08.029 --> 00:23:08.039 align:start position:0%
up and running and I know it's and it it
 
00:23:10.789 --> 00:23:10.799 align:start position:0%
still continues to involve on the part
 
00:23:12.770 --> 00:23:12.780 align:start position:0%
of the judicial branch a fair amount of
 
00:23:14.990 --> 00:23:15.000 align:start position:0%
work because as I understand it most of
 
00:23:17.510 --> 00:23:17.520 align:start position:0%
these hearings are that that are waived
 
00:23:19.789 --> 00:23:19.799 align:start position:0%
are waived relatively late in the
 
00:23:21.710 --> 00:23:21.720 align:start position:0%
process after the judicial branch at
 
00:23:24.830 --> 00:23:24.840 align:start position:0%
least has put in a fair amount of work
 
00:23:28.250 --> 00:23:28.260 align:start position:0%
um and I think my my
 
00:23:30.110 --> 00:23:30.120 align:start position:0%
take on it is that from the perspective
 
00:23:31.669 --> 00:23:31.679 align:start position:0%
of the judicial branch
 
00:23:34.430 --> 00:23:34.440 align:start position:0%
they they they made a good faith effort
 
00:23:37.370 --> 00:23:37.380 align:start position:0%
to to implement the statute as written I
 
00:23:38.570 --> 00:23:38.580 align:start position:0%
think they I think from their
 
00:23:40.430 --> 00:23:40.440 align:start position:0%
perspective they did that and it just it
 
00:23:42.169 --> 00:23:42.179 align:start position:0%
as representative Qatar points out it
 
00:23:43.909 --> 00:23:43.919 align:start position:0%
just has not been used it hasn't really
 
00:23:43.919 --> 00:23:45.649 align:start position:0%
just has not been used it hasn't really
accomplished

00:23:45.649 --> 00:23:45.659 align:start position:0%
accomplished
 
00:23:45.659 --> 00:23:46.610 align:start position:0%
accomplished
um

00:23:46.610 --> 00:23:46.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:48.950 --> 00:23:48.960 align:start position:0%
its original goals and so high for that
 
00:23:51.529 --> 00:23:51.539 align:start position:0%
reason I I and I think the witnesses
 
00:23:53.029 --> 00:23:53.039 align:start position:0%
that we heard at the hearing really made
 
00:23:57.310 --> 00:23:57.320 align:start position:0%
a compelling case of why the Senate's
 
00:23:59.930 --> 00:23:59.940 align:start position:0%
decision to repeal it is one that we
 
00:24:02.390 --> 00:24:02.400 align:start position:0%
should follow so I I support the uh
 
00:24:05.510 --> 00:24:05.520 align:start position:0%
uh the motion any anyone else wish to be
 
00:24:08.029 --> 00:24:08.039 align:start position:0%
heard on this
 
00:24:09.830 --> 00:24:09.840 align:start position:0%
all right I guess we're ready for a vote
 
00:24:11.690 --> 00:24:11.700 align:start position:0%

00:26:28.490 --> 00:26:28.500 align:start position:0%
the bill came to us from the Senate was
 
00:26:31.490 --> 00:26:31.500 align:start position:0%
it it it required the clerk to make an
 
00:26:34.669 --> 00:26:34.679 align:start position:0%
accommodation to parties uh by meeting
 
00:26:37.250 --> 00:26:37.260 align:start position:0%
either in person or electronically with
 
00:26:38.870 --> 00:26:38.880 align:start position:0%
the parties
 
00:26:41.269 --> 00:26:41.279 align:start position:0%
um the prime sponsor of the bill Senator
 
00:26:43.789 --> 00:26:43.799 align:start position:0%
uh bird cell indicated that there was at
 
00:26:43.799 --> 00:26:44.690 align:start position:0%
uh bird cell indicated that there was at
least

00:26:44.690 --> 00:26:44.700 align:start position:0%
least
 
00:26:48.230 --> 00:26:48.240 align:start position:0%
some confusion as to how the word shell
 
00:26:50.330 --> 00:26:50.340 align:start position:0%
as opposed to May got into the bill
 
00:26:53.930 --> 00:26:53.940 align:start position:0%
because the the uh the original intent
 
00:26:56.750 --> 00:26:56.760 align:start position:0%
had been May to give the clerk's
 
00:26:59.510 --> 00:26:59.520 align:start position:0%
discretion to decide whether to make an
 
00:27:01.430 --> 00:27:01.440 align:start position:0%
accommodation or not
 
00:27:05.870 --> 00:27:05.880 align:start position:0%
um and Senator Bert cell urged us to go
 
00:27:07.850 --> 00:27:07.860 align:start position:0%
back to that may as opposed to Shell
 
00:27:09.710 --> 00:27:09.720 align:start position:0%
because she felt that the clerk should
 
00:27:12.710 --> 00:27:12.720 align:start position:0%
have discretion to not do this if they
 
00:27:14.930 --> 00:27:14.940 align:start position:0%
felt that there was some
 
00:27:17.510 --> 00:27:17.520 align:start position:0%
you know that something just didn't seem
 
00:27:19.250 --> 00:27:19.260 align:start position:0%
right about the request
 
00:27:23.029 --> 00:27:23.039 align:start position:0%
um uh and so I think
 
00:27:25.310 --> 00:27:25.320 align:start position:0%
my sense from the was it the committee
 
00:27:26.810 --> 00:27:26.820 align:start position:0%
thought that was a good idea to go back
 
00:27:29.450 --> 00:27:29.460 align:start position:0%
to May and then the other issue that was
 
00:27:29.460 --> 00:27:30.430 align:start position:0%
to May and then the other issue that was
raised

00:27:30.430 --> 00:27:30.440 align:start position:0%
raised
 
00:27:34.070 --> 00:27:34.080 align:start position:0%
was that people had concern people on
 
00:27:35.990 --> 00:27:36.000 align:start position:0%
the committee had concerns about the
 
00:27:37.970 --> 00:27:37.980 align:start position:0%
electronically about allowing this to be
 
00:27:40.250 --> 00:27:40.260 align:start position:0%
done electronically and my understanding
 
00:27:41.810 --> 00:27:41.820 align:start position:0%
again that was that those concerns were
 
00:27:43.730 --> 00:27:43.740 align:start position:0%
on vote really on boat there were there
 
00:27:45.169 --> 00:27:45.179 align:start position:0%
was sort of a bipartisan concern
 
00:27:47.630 --> 00:27:47.640 align:start position:0%
regarding that and so for that reason I
 
00:27:51.110 --> 00:27:51.120 align:start position:0%
took that out so that the the
 
00:27:53.570 --> 00:27:53.580 align:start position:0%
um the the way the amendment reads now
 
00:27:55.909 --> 00:27:55.919 align:start position:0%
it says um and I'm quoting now it's
 
00:27:57.830 --> 00:27:57.840 align:start position:0%
either party is unable to appear in
 
00:27:59.870 --> 00:27:59.880 align:start position:0%
person for documented medical reasons
 
00:28:02.750 --> 00:28:02.760 align:start position:0%
the city or town clerk May accommodate
 
00:28:05.330 --> 00:28:05.340 align:start position:0%
the parties by meeting in person with
 
00:28:06.830 --> 00:28:06.840 align:start position:0%
the parties at such other location
 
00:28:08.810 --> 00:28:08.820 align:start position:0%
within the city or town as may be
 
00:28:11.710 --> 00:28:11.720 align:start position:0%
convenient and I think that addresses
 
00:28:15.830 --> 00:28:15.840 align:start position:0%
the various concerns that were that were
 
00:28:15.840 --> 00:28:17.269 align:start position:0%
the various concerns that were that were
raised

00:28:17.269 --> 00:28:17.279 align:start position:0%
raised
 
00:28:20.870 --> 00:28:20.880 align:start position:0%
um and so uh for that reason I I hope
 
00:28:23.470 --> 00:28:23.480 align:start position:0%
people will support the amendment
 
00:28:26.029 --> 00:28:26.039 align:start position:0%
anyone else wish to speak on the
 
00:28:26.039 --> 00:28:28.130 align:start position:0%
anyone else wish to speak on the
amendment

00:28:28.130 --> 00:28:28.140 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:28:30.649 --> 00:28:30.659 align:start position:0%
seeing none um I guess I would ask for a
 
00:28:33.110 --> 00:28:33.120 align:start position:0%
show of hands then uh all those in favor
 
00:28:37.070 --> 00:28:37.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:39.470 --> 00:28:39.480 align:start position:0%
any opposed
 
00:28:41.269 --> 00:28:41.279 align:start position:0%
seeing none it was appears it's a
 
00:28:51.649 --> 00:28:51.659 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:53.750 --> 00:28:53.760 align:start position:0%
just making some notes Here
 
00:28:55.669 --> 00:28:55.679 align:start position:0%
all right I guess we're ready for a uh
 
00:28:57.710 --> 00:28:57.720 align:start position:0%
anyone else wish to speak on the main
 
00:29:01.990 --> 00:29:02.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:05.570 --> 00:29:05.580 align:start position:0%
Just one thought that I have is it says
 
00:29:07.669 --> 00:29:07.679 align:start position:0%
documented medical reasons but it
 
00:29:11.090 --> 00:29:11.100 align:start position:0%
doesn't really say how medical reasons
 
00:29:13.190 --> 00:29:13.200 align:start position:0%
would be documented or who gets to make
 
00:29:15.649 --> 00:29:15.659 align:start position:0%
the decision about whether they are or
 
00:29:17.810 --> 00:29:17.820 align:start position:0%
not that's my one concern that I have
 
00:29:21.769 --> 00:29:21.779 align:start position:0%
looking at this is is it's it's opening
 
00:29:24.950 --> 00:29:24.960 align:start position:0%
up the door for having to disclose you
 
00:29:26.510 --> 00:29:26.520 align:start position:0%
know private medical information but
 
00:29:28.970 --> 00:29:28.980 align:start position:0%
it's not really clear what needs to be
 
00:29:32.450 --> 00:29:32.460 align:start position:0%
disclosed or or how or who or to whom
 
00:29:34.130 --> 00:29:34.140 align:start position:0%
I don't know if anyone has thoughts on
 
00:29:36.710 --> 00:29:36.720 align:start position:0%
that representative
 
00:29:38.810 --> 00:29:38.820 align:start position:0%
so I think that was one of the big
 
00:29:41.269 --> 00:29:41.279 align:start position:0%
reasons for making it say May so that
 
00:29:42.769 --> 00:29:42.779 align:start position:0%
the clerk would have the discretion to
 
00:29:44.750 --> 00:29:44.760 align:start position:0%
accept it or not because let's say in
 
00:29:47.330 --> 00:29:47.340 align:start position:0%
the example of a nursing home it may be
 
00:29:49.310 --> 00:29:49.320 align:start position:0%
completely reasonable to accept medical
 
00:29:53.269 --> 00:29:53.279 align:start position:0%
documentation from an RN stating that
 
00:29:56.510 --> 00:29:56.520 align:start position:0%
the person is incapacitated in in a
 
00:29:58.850 --> 00:29:58.860 align:start position:0%
nursing home right versus
 
00:30:01.370 --> 00:30:01.380 align:start position:0%
in another circumstance where somebody's
 
00:30:04.610 --> 00:30:04.620 align:start position:0%
not in that it may be more reasonable to
 
00:30:08.269 --> 00:30:08.279 align:start position:0%
expect a note from a physician so that
 
00:30:10.070 --> 00:30:10.080 align:start position:0%
gives the leeway of the clerk to accept
 
00:30:11.570 --> 00:30:11.580 align:start position:0%
if something's reasonable or not
 
00:30:14.269 --> 00:30:14.279 align:start position:0%
depending on the circumstances and from
 
00:30:18.169 --> 00:30:18.179 align:start position:0%
the testimony we heard it seemed as if
 
00:30:19.730 --> 00:30:19.740 align:start position:0%
the clerks were wanting this because
 
00:30:21.529 --> 00:30:21.539 align:start position:0%
they wanted to be able to provide this
 
00:30:24.850 --> 00:30:24.860 align:start position:0%
service to you know residents that maybe
 
00:30:27.649 --> 00:30:27.659 align:start position:0%
having a medical issue and and wanting
 
00:30:28.970 --> 00:30:28.980 align:start position:0%
to get married so it didn't seem like
 
00:30:30.889 --> 00:30:30.899 align:start position:0%
they were going to be searching for
 
00:30:32.750 --> 00:30:32.760 align:start position:0%
reasons not to accept but that if
 
00:30:34.610 --> 00:30:34.620 align:start position:0%
something came across that you know
 
00:30:37.310 --> 00:30:37.320 align:start position:0%
appeared to be potentially fraudulent or
 
00:30:38.570 --> 00:30:38.580 align:start position:0%
something like that then in that case
 
00:30:40.610 --> 00:30:40.620 align:start position:0%
they would have the discretion to say
 
00:30:42.169 --> 00:30:42.179 align:start position:0%
I'm uncomfortable with this you would
 
00:30:46.549 --> 00:30:46.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:48.830 --> 00:30:48.840 align:start position:0%
yes uh representative Smith and then
 
00:30:51.350 --> 00:30:51.360 align:start position:0%
representative Perez thank you very much
 
00:30:55.430 --> 00:30:55.440 align:start position:0%
I agree with what the clerk said I would
 
00:30:59.389 --> 00:30:59.399 align:start position:0%
also add to the clerk's comments and in
 
00:31:02.389 --> 00:31:02.399 align:start position:0%
response to the initial question
 
00:31:03.889 --> 00:31:03.899 align:start position:0%
um that
 
00:31:03.899 --> 00:31:04.549 align:start position:0%
um that
um

00:31:04.549 --> 00:31:04.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:31:07.570 --> 00:31:07.580 align:start position:0%
using clerk in the different sense
 
00:31:10.669 --> 00:31:10.679 align:start position:0%
the clerks who were the subject of this
 
00:31:13.010 --> 00:31:13.020 align:start position:0%
um have to deal with a confidential
 
00:31:17.029 --> 00:31:17.039 align:start position:0%
material all the time and are quite I
 
00:31:20.350 --> 00:31:20.360 align:start position:0%
believe Adept at making sure that they
 
00:31:24.350 --> 00:31:24.360 align:start position:0%
do not have a direct pipeline to
 
00:31:25.630 --> 00:31:25.640 align:start position:0%
um any
 
00:31:28.690 --> 00:31:28.700 align:start position:0%
any public
 
00:31:31.269 --> 00:31:31.279 align:start position:0%
body to
 
00:31:34.490 --> 00:31:34.500 align:start position:0%
inappropriately share
 
00:31:34.500 --> 00:31:35.950 align:start position:0%
inappropriately share
medical

00:31:35.950 --> 00:31:35.960 align:start position:0%
medical
 
00:31:39.950 --> 00:31:39.960 align:start position:0%
reports and I think it is very helpful
 
00:31:43.070 --> 00:31:43.080 align:start position:0%
to have the language as flexible as
 
00:31:45.350 --> 00:31:45.360 align:start position:0%
possible because we rely on those
 
00:31:48.649 --> 00:31:48.659 align:start position:0%
elected clerks to use good judgment
 
00:31:51.649 --> 00:31:51.659 align:start position:0%
representative Perez
 
00:31:54.350 --> 00:31:54.360 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my response um
 
00:31:58.010 --> 00:31:58.020 align:start position:0%
medical diagnosis HIPAA violations do
 
00:32:00.710 --> 00:32:00.720 align:start position:0%
not need to occur in this at all all you
 
00:32:02.630 --> 00:32:02.640 align:start position:0%
need is that there is a medical reason
 
00:32:06.350 --> 00:32:06.360 align:start position:0%
is the only reason having managed the
 
00:32:07.970 --> 00:32:07.980 align:start position:0%
New England Heart Institute at one time
 
00:32:09.889 --> 00:32:09.899 align:start position:0%
I wrote many of these to be signed by
 
00:32:12.289 --> 00:32:12.299 align:start position:0%
the doctor and you do not have to give a
 
00:32:14.149 --> 00:32:14.159 align:start position:0%
reason you just have to say that there
 
00:32:16.310 --> 00:32:16.320 align:start position:0%
is medically necessary
 
00:32:19.789 --> 00:32:19.799 align:start position:0%
and so hipic doesn't need to be violated
 
00:32:22.310 --> 00:32:22.320 align:start position:0%
any any other uh yes representative
 
00:32:24.830 --> 00:32:24.840 align:start position:0%
Stapleton thank you Mr chair I I think
 
00:32:27.049 --> 00:32:27.059 align:start position:0%
his long lawmakers we have the tendency
 
00:32:29.330 --> 00:32:29.340 align:start position:0%
sometimes to drill down too deep and to
 
00:32:31.190 --> 00:32:31.200 align:start position:0%
get into the weeds
 
00:32:33.710 --> 00:32:33.720 align:start position:0%
and I've been guilty of that myself and
 
00:32:36.590 --> 00:32:36.600 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to avoid that because we've
 
00:32:39.769 --> 00:32:39.779 align:start position:0%
given discretion to the clerk the
 
00:32:41.690 --> 00:32:41.700 align:start position:0%
medical documentation that they're
 
00:32:44.630 --> 00:32:44.640 align:start position:0%
satisfied with is up to their discretion
 
00:32:47.510 --> 00:32:47.520 align:start position:0%
as well and lets people let people do
 
00:32:49.970 --> 00:32:49.980 align:start position:0%
the job that know how to do them instead
 
00:32:52.610 --> 00:32:52.620 align:start position:0%
of us trying to micromanage
 
00:32:54.950 --> 00:32:54.960 align:start position:0%
you know the last thing I say is I I
 
00:32:56.630 --> 00:32:56.640 align:start position:0%
know I don't know if it was said it at
 
00:32:59.090 --> 00:32:59.100 align:start position:0%
the hearing but I I know that at our at
 
00:33:00.889 --> 00:33:00.899 align:start position:0%
that the Republican caucus somebody
 
00:33:02.690 --> 00:33:02.700 align:start position:0%
mentioned that
 
00:33:05.450 --> 00:33:05.460 align:start position:0%
um this Bill had been requested by the
 
00:33:08.990 --> 00:33:09.000 align:start position:0%
clerks and that it was what they were
 
00:33:11.510 --> 00:33:11.520 align:start position:0%
they are already doing this many clerks
 
00:33:13.430 --> 00:33:13.440 align:start position:0%
are already doing this and apparently
 
00:33:16.850 --> 00:33:16.860 align:start position:0%
without any problem and and the reason
 
00:33:18.590 --> 00:33:18.600 align:start position:0%
that we got this legislation is that
 
00:33:20.630 --> 00:33:20.640 align:start position:0%
somebody was concerned it's by basically
 
00:33:23.330 --> 00:33:23.340 align:start position:0%
saying you know we've been doing this it
 
00:33:25.370 --> 00:33:25.380 align:start position:0%
seems to be going okay but there we
 
00:33:26.630 --> 00:33:26.640 align:start position:0%
there really is a question about whether
 
00:33:28.190 --> 00:33:28.200 align:start position:0%
we actually have the authority to do it
 
00:33:29.870 --> 00:33:29.880 align:start position:0%
maybe we should go to the legislature
 
00:33:32.630 --> 00:33:32.640 align:start position:0%
and specifically confirm our Authority
 
00:33:34.909 --> 00:33:34.919 align:start position:0%
so I guess what I'm I mean my point on
 
00:33:37.310 --> 00:33:37.320 align:start position:0%
that is simply to say it appears from
 
00:33:38.870 --> 00:33:38.880 align:start position:0%
all we've seen
 
00:33:40.970 --> 00:33:40.980 align:start position:0%
that the clerks are appropriately
 
00:33:42.950 --> 00:33:42.960 align:start position:0%
exercising their discretion as as you
 
00:33:45.230 --> 00:33:45.240 align:start position:0%
mentioned and so I I don't see any
 
00:33:46.970 --> 00:33:46.980 align:start position:0%
reason to think that wouldn't continue
 
00:33:49.130 --> 00:33:49.140 align:start position:0%
so um
 
00:33:52.009 --> 00:33:52.019 align:start position:0%
uh any any further comments on this uh
 
00:33:55.310 --> 00:33:55.320 align:start position:0%
in this bill ready for a vote all right
 
00:33:56.750 --> 00:33:56.760 align:start position:0%
I'll ask the clerk then to please call
 
00:34:00.909 --> 00:34:00.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:04.250 --> 00:34:04.260 align:start position:0%

00:34:54.290 --> 00:34:54.300 align:start position:0%
all right consent and I will uh write

00:34:58.550 --> 00:34:58.560 align:start position:0%
well you know I think on the screen
 
00:35:00.109 --> 00:35:00.119 align:start position:0%

all right
 
00:35:16.440 --> 00:35:17.030 align:start position:0%
all right
um

00:35:17.030 --> 00:35:17.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:20.270 --> 00:35:20.280 align:start position:0%
next we turn to uh
 
00:35:23.630 --> 00:35:23.640 align:start position:0%
SB 1
 
00:35:27.109 --> 00:35:27.119 align:start position:0%
no reminder two oh I'm sorry 92.
 
00:35:27.119 --> 00:35:28.450 align:start position:0%
no reminder two oh I'm sorry 92.
right

00:35:28.450 --> 00:35:28.460 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:35:31.430 --> 00:35:31.440 align:start position:0%
SB 92 and
 
00:35:34.609 --> 00:35:34.619 align:start position:0%
um for that I'd represent uh recognize
 
00:35:36.950 --> 00:35:36.960 align:start position:0%
representative Kenny for a motion
 
00:35:40.190 --> 00:35:40.200 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I move itl
 
00:35:42.349 --> 00:35:42.359 align:start position:0%
is there a second I second the motion
 
00:35:43.609 --> 00:35:43.619 align:start position:0%
all right all right uh representative
 
00:35:44.750 --> 00:35:44.760 align:start position:0%
Kennedy would you like to speak to your
 
00:35:47.750 --> 00:35:47.760 align:start position:0%
motion uh yeah sure um so this basically
 
00:35:49.910 --> 00:35:49.920 align:start position:0%
adds functions to a position that really
 
00:35:52.010 --> 00:35:52.020 align:start position:0%
doesn't have any duties currently and
 
00:35:53.630 --> 00:35:53.640 align:start position:0%
they only make a hundred dollars a year
 
00:35:56.510 --> 00:35:56.520 align:start position:0%
so I I just don't think this bill offers
 
00:35:58.609 --> 00:35:58.619 align:start position:0%
productive changes and urge you to vote
 
00:36:02.510 --> 00:36:02.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:03.890 --> 00:36:03.900 align:start position:0%
um yes I
 
00:36:06.530 --> 00:36:06.540 align:start position:0%
I've been a uh proponent of restoring
 
00:36:07.910 --> 00:36:07.920 align:start position:0%
some of the doing something with the
 
00:36:11.150 --> 00:36:11.160 align:start position:0%
office of register probate but this
 
00:36:13.790 --> 00:36:13.800 align:start position:0%
um this isn't it and the judicial branch
 
00:36:15.890 --> 00:36:15.900 align:start position:0%
was not in favor of it um
 
00:36:17.930 --> 00:36:17.940 align:start position:0%
of the incumbent registers of probate
 
00:36:19.730 --> 00:36:19.740 align:start position:0%
showed up if I recall at least not here
 
00:36:21.290 --> 00:36:21.300 align:start position:0%
in the house meeting and there's also
 
00:36:23.569 --> 00:36:23.579 align:start position:0%
also the salary is still fixed at a
 
00:36:24.770 --> 00:36:24.780 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars a year even though
 
00:36:26.390 --> 00:36:26.400 align:start position:0%
they'd be doing
 
00:36:28.130 --> 00:36:28.140 align:start position:0%
more than they're doing now which is
 
00:36:30.829 --> 00:36:30.839 align:start position:0%
essentially nothing except they have
 
00:36:33.230 --> 00:36:33.240 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to work with the state
 
00:36:34.790 --> 00:36:34.800 align:start position:0%
archive to preserve the historical
 
00:36:37.510 --> 00:36:37.520 align:start position:0%
probate records so I would
 
00:36:39.650 --> 00:36:39.660 align:start position:0%
so even though I've even though I've
 
00:36:40.970 --> 00:36:40.980 align:start position:0%
been a friend of the registers of
 
00:36:43.310 --> 00:36:43.320 align:start position:0%
probate and actually the office just
 
00:36:45.230 --> 00:36:45.240 align:start position:0%
barely survived we had a constitutional
 
00:36:47.510 --> 00:36:47.520 align:start position:0%
amendment where there was a floor fight
 
00:36:51.069 --> 00:36:51.079 align:start position:0%
me and representative lard if a former
 
00:36:54.310 --> 00:36:54.320 align:start position:0%
former Vice chair of this committee we
 
00:36:56.630 --> 00:36:56.640 align:start position:0%
put up the good fight and we fell about
 
00:36:59.630 --> 00:36:59.640 align:start position:0%
uh we need about 100 votes to stop the
 
00:37:01.310 --> 00:37:01.320 align:start position:0%
Constitutional Amendment and we only got
 
00:37:03.710 --> 00:37:03.720 align:start position:0%
about 25 so it was kind of a
 
00:37:06.829 --> 00:37:06.839 align:start position:0%
kind of a fiasco but it did fail uh in
 
00:37:08.089 --> 00:37:08.099 align:start position:0%
the vote amongst the people because
 
00:37:10.130 --> 00:37:10.140 align:start position:0%
certain percentage of people just were
 
00:37:12.170 --> 00:37:12.180 align:start position:0%
concerned about taking the right to vote
 
00:37:14.750 --> 00:37:14.760 align:start position:0%
for any office away from the electorate
 
00:37:17.990 --> 00:37:18.000 align:start position:0%
so that's an overly long anyway I
 
00:37:19.069 --> 00:37:19.079 align:start position:0%
definitely don't
 
00:37:21.349 --> 00:37:21.359 align:start position:0%
I think what's in this bill is uh not
 
00:37:24.170 --> 00:37:24.180 align:start position:0%
worth pursuing so I'll be joining in the
 
00:37:27.050 --> 00:37:27.060 align:start position:0%
rest of us and voting to kill voting the
 
00:37:29.030 --> 00:37:29.040 align:start position:0%
itl dispel
 
00:37:33.170 --> 00:37:33.180 align:start position:0%
anyone else wish to speak on this bill
 
00:37:34.790 --> 00:37:34.800 align:start position:0%
seeing none I guess we're ready for a
 
00:37:39.470 --> 00:37:39.480 align:start position:0%

indigent persons involved in mediation
 
00:39:04.250 --> 00:39:04.260 align:start position:0%
services and a chair recognized
 
00:39:05.690 --> 00:39:05.700 align:start position:0%
representative Wallace for a motion
 
00:39:07.790 --> 00:39:07.800 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I move ought to
 
00:39:07.800 --> 00:39:08.810 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I move ought to
pass

00:39:08.810 --> 00:39:08.820 align:start position:0%
pass
 
00:39:14.030 --> 00:39:14.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:16.190 --> 00:39:16.200 align:start position:0%
briefly um
 
00:39:17.870 --> 00:39:17.880 align:start position:0%
from my understanding and what was heard
 
00:39:20.690 --> 00:39:20.700 align:start position:0%
in testimony in the hearing attorney had
 
00:39:22.970 --> 00:39:22.980 align:start position:0%
from the Department of Justice made this
 
00:39:25.609 --> 00:39:25.619 align:start position:0%
recommendation uh as it seems that the
 
00:39:27.710 --> 00:39:27.720 align:start position:0%
bulk of the mediation
 
00:39:30.650 --> 00:39:30.660 align:start position:0%
is not being uh sought by people of
 
00:39:32.690 --> 00:39:32.700 align:start position:0%
Indian that are Indigent so we're
 
00:39:35.329 --> 00:39:35.339 align:start position:0%
getting a much greater court costs uh to
 
00:39:36.470 --> 00:39:36.480 align:start position:0%
handling the matters that they may be
 
00:39:38.569 --> 00:39:38.579 align:start position:0%
involved in and this is more or less a
 
00:39:42.470 --> 00:39:42.480 align:start position:0%
uh to streamline the operation uh
 
00:39:44.450 --> 00:39:44.460 align:start position:0%
that's about it
 
00:39:46.430 --> 00:39:46.440 align:start position:0%
all right anyone else wish to be yes
 
00:39:47.870 --> 00:39:47.880 align:start position:0%
representative Manos
 
00:39:49.250 --> 00:39:49.260 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
00:39:51.710 --> 00:39:51.720 align:start position:0%
um I'm going to support the motion for
 
00:39:54.829 --> 00:39:54.839 align:start position:0%
OTP but my one hesitancy is that this
 
00:39:57.190 --> 00:39:57.200 align:start position:0%
Deals Only with families with children
 
00:40:00.829 --> 00:40:00.839 align:start position:0%
and there are certainly families who use
 
00:40:03.710 --> 00:40:03.720 align:start position:0%
mediation who do not have children and
 
00:40:05.930 --> 00:40:05.940 align:start position:0%
so I think it could potentially have a
 
00:40:08.569 --> 00:40:08.579 align:start position:0%
two-tier a two-tier approach which I
 
00:40:11.270 --> 00:40:11.280 align:start position:0%
don't think is productive but perhaps in
 
00:40:13.730 --> 00:40:13.740 align:start position:0%
the future we can address families
 
00:40:16.089 --> 00:40:16.099 align:start position:0%
without children
 
00:40:19.670 --> 00:40:19.680 align:start position:0%
anyone else wish to comment
 
00:40:20.990 --> 00:40:21.000 align:start position:0%
you know I guess the only thing I would
 
00:40:23.089 --> 00:40:23.099 align:start position:0%
say is I you I mean I think you raised a
 
00:40:25.849 --> 00:40:25.859 align:start position:0%
good point it if I recall Mr head's
 
00:40:28.130 --> 00:40:28.140 align:start position:0%
testimony he was saying that the
 
00:40:31.130 --> 00:40:31.140 align:start position:0%
uh apparently like up to three hours of
 
00:40:33.530 --> 00:40:33.540 align:start position:0%
mediation is available that can be paid
 
00:40:36.770 --> 00:40:36.780 align:start position:0%
for through the mediation fund and
 
00:40:40.130 --> 00:40:40.140 align:start position:0%
the concern was that people that uh in
 
00:40:42.470 --> 00:40:42.480 align:start position:0%
under the prior system where people had
 
00:40:44.690 --> 00:40:44.700 align:start position:0%
to P people would be paid would have to
 
00:40:47.990 --> 00:40:48.000 align:start position:0%
uh would have to pay uh people that were
 
00:40:49.550 --> 00:40:49.560 align:start position:0%
either Indigent or very close to the
 
00:40:51.829 --> 00:40:51.839 align:start position:0%
line would only use the minimum required
 
00:40:53.569 --> 00:40:53.579 align:start position:0%
amount of mediation which I think might
 
00:40:54.770 --> 00:40:54.780 align:start position:0%
have been an hour or something like that
 
00:40:58.730 --> 00:40:58.740 align:start position:0%
in and so it might be that the that the
 
00:41:00.589 --> 00:41:00.599 align:start position:0%
the court I don't know I don't know if
 
00:41:02.030 --> 00:41:02.040 align:start position:0%
he specifically said that and I'm just
 
00:41:03.589 --> 00:41:03.599 align:start position:0%
I'm speculating here but it might be
 
00:41:06.890 --> 00:41:06.900 align:start position:0%
that that the cases that require more
 
00:41:09.589 --> 00:41:09.599 align:start position:0%
than an hour are more likely to be ones
 
00:41:11.450 --> 00:41:11.460 align:start position:0%
involve children and that that's where
 
00:41:13.069 --> 00:41:13.079 align:start position:0%
you know that's why they limited here I
 
00:41:14.390 --> 00:41:14.400 align:start position:0%
I don't know I'm not saying that that's
 
00:41:15.770 --> 00:41:15.780 align:start position:0%
always true but that might be the reason
 
00:41:17.690 --> 00:41:17.700 align:start position:0%
that they did it but certainly in the
 
00:41:19.190 --> 00:41:19.200 align:start position:0%
future I think it might be this would be
 
00:41:20.990 --> 00:41:21.000 align:start position:0%
something worth looking into if we try
 
00:41:23.750 --> 00:41:23.760 align:start position:0%
you know if it should be expanded uh to
 
00:41:25.670 --> 00:41:25.680 align:start position:0%
other other situations
 
00:41:27.770 --> 00:41:27.780 align:start position:0%
but anyone else
 
00:41:32.510 --> 00:41:32.520 align:start position:0%

um SB 183 ought to pass and I move
 
00:42:48.650 --> 00:42:48.660 align:start position:0%
Amendment 1402h
 
00:42:50.750 --> 00:42:50.760 align:start position:0%
is there a second
 
00:42:52.430 --> 00:42:52.440 align:start position:0%
I second that
 
00:42:54.349 --> 00:42:54.359 align:start position:0%
all right representative uh Alexander
 
00:42:55.790 --> 00:42:55.800 align:start position:0%
would you wish to speak to your motion
 
00:42:58.730 --> 00:42:58.740 align:start position:0%
yes um so this bill would exempt certain
 
00:43:01.069 --> 00:43:01.079 align:start position:0%
calls from nine let me pull it up real
 
00:43:02.510 --> 00:43:02.520 align:start position:0%
quick I have just the amendment in front
 
00:43:04.910 --> 00:43:04.920 align:start position:0%
of me um certain calls from
 
00:43:07.370 --> 00:43:07.380 align:start position:0%
um 911 calls from the right to no law
 
00:43:09.650 --> 00:43:09.660 align:start position:0%
um but it adds in
 
00:43:11.329 --> 00:43:11.339 align:start position:0%
um the caller illegal representative
 
00:43:13.190 --> 00:43:13.200 align:start position:0%
with the
 
00:43:16.130 --> 00:43:16.140 align:start position:0%
in my Amendment would also add the
 
00:43:17.809 --> 00:43:17.819 align:start position:0%
subject of the call or a legal
 
00:43:17.819 --> 00:43:19.309 align:start position:0%
subject of the call or a legal
representative

00:43:19.309 --> 00:43:19.319 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:43:20.990 --> 00:43:21.000 align:start position:0%
um so this was presented to the
 
00:43:23.630 --> 00:43:23.640 align:start position:0%
committee as a compromise between
 
00:43:23.640 --> 00:43:24.710 align:start position:0%
committee as a compromise between
um

00:43:24.710 --> 00:43:24.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:28.790 --> 00:43:28.800 align:start position:0%
trial judges and the uh police or law
 
00:43:31.609 --> 00:43:31.619 align:start position:0%
enforcement Community because it adds it
 
00:43:33.410 --> 00:43:33.420 align:start position:0%
adds the exemption for limited purpose
 
00:43:33.420 --> 00:43:34.670 align:start position:0%
adds the exemption for limited purpose
release

00:43:34.670 --> 00:43:34.680 align:start position:0%
release
 
00:43:39.170 --> 00:43:39.180 align:start position:0%
um and and make sure that the um
 
00:43:40.910 --> 00:43:40.920 align:start position:0%
records in which the subject of a
 
00:43:42.710 --> 00:43:42.720 align:start position:0%
criminal investigation will be released
 
00:43:44.089 --> 00:43:44.099 align:start position:0%
only after the criminal matter is
 
00:43:45.410 --> 00:43:45.420 align:start position:0%
concluded so
 
00:43:46.670 --> 00:43:46.680 align:start position:0%
um this amendment would just add the
 
00:43:48.710 --> 00:43:48.720 align:start position:0%
subject of the call as well I mean if if
 
00:43:50.390 --> 00:43:50.400 align:start position:0%
the committee remembers during the
 
00:43:52.130 --> 00:43:52.140 align:start position:0%
public hearing I asked I gave the
 
00:43:55.190 --> 00:43:55.200 align:start position:0%
scenario of if I got hit on mass Road
 
00:43:57.710 --> 00:43:57.720 align:start position:0%
and Goffstown in representative Lanza
 
00:44:00.349 --> 00:44:00.359 align:start position:0%
made the phone call about how the red
 
00:44:03.050 --> 00:44:03.060 align:start position:0%
Jeep hit my silver Hyundai I didn't know
 
00:44:04.970 --> 00:44:04.980 align:start position:0%
the call existed but maybe if I call the
 
00:44:06.470 --> 00:44:06.480 align:start position:0%
police department and asked that
 
00:44:08.690 --> 00:44:08.700 align:start position:0%
somebody made a call about me being the
 
00:44:10.430 --> 00:44:10.440 align:start position:0%
subject of the call that my car was hit
 
00:44:13.609 --> 00:44:13.619 align:start position:0%
then I'd be able to to use that in an
 
00:44:16.670 --> 00:44:16.680 align:start position:0%
insurance request so I could get money
 
00:44:19.430 --> 00:44:19.440 align:start position:0%
for my car being hit so so I believe
 
00:44:22.250 --> 00:44:22.260 align:start position:0%
this this bill strengthens or this
 
00:44:24.410 --> 00:44:24.420 align:start position:0%
amendment strengthens the bill and if
 
00:44:28.190 --> 00:44:28.200 align:start position:0%
you see there is also a bipartisan or a
 
00:44:30.170 --> 00:44:30.180 align:start position:0%
compromise on this amendment as well and
 
00:44:32.930 --> 00:44:32.940 align:start position:0%
it's supported by the um the Chiefs as
 
00:44:34.730 --> 00:44:34.740 align:start position:0%
well as the trial judges so I asked to
 
00:44:36.470 --> 00:44:36.480 align:start position:0%
support it
 
00:44:39.470 --> 00:44:39.480 align:start position:0%
anyone else wish to be heard on um yes
 
00:44:42.410 --> 00:44:42.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:44.510 --> 00:44:44.520 align:start position:0%
thank you rep Alexander for your work on
 
00:44:46.490 --> 00:44:46.500 align:start position:0%
this amendment I did also want to note
 
00:44:49.430 --> 00:44:49.440 align:start position:0%
that I did contact the original sponsor
 
00:44:51.109 --> 00:44:51.119 align:start position:0%
of the Bell Senator rashardi and I did
 
00:44:53.329 --> 00:44:53.339 align:start position:0%
speak to her and she let me know kind of
 
00:44:55.130 --> 00:44:55.140 align:start position:0%
who the stakeholders of this were and it
 
00:44:57.290 --> 00:44:57.300 align:start position:0%
was as rep Alexander mentioned the
 
00:44:59.089 --> 00:44:59.099 align:start position:0%
chiefs of police and I did personally
 
00:45:01.609 --> 00:45:01.619 align:start position:0%
reach out to the president of the chief
 
00:45:03.230 --> 00:45:03.240 align:start position:0%
chief of police
 
00:45:03.240 --> 00:45:03.790 align:start position:0%
chief of police
um

00:45:03.790 --> 00:45:03.800 align:start position:0%

00:45:07.309 --> 00:45:07.319 align:start position:0%
Chief brifonski from Bedford and I did
 
00:45:10.430 --> 00:45:10.440 align:start position:0%

Safety
um

00:45:12.470 --> 00:45:12.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:14.930 --> 00:45:14.940 align:start position:0%
director and they were both in support
 
00:45:16.790 --> 00:45:16.800 align:start position:0%
of this they did pass it along to the
 
00:45:18.770 --> 00:45:18.780 align:start position:0%
other Chiefs to make sure that they
 
00:45:19.849 --> 00:45:19.859 align:start position:0%
weren't missing something that was
 
00:45:22.130 --> 00:45:22.140 align:start position:0%
potentially concerning but provided that
 
00:45:24.170 --> 00:45:24.180 align:start position:0%
the exclusion remained in there about
 
00:45:24.180 --> 00:45:26.270 align:start position:0%
the exclusion remained in there about
the

00:45:26.270 --> 00:45:26.280 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:45:28.130 --> 00:45:28.140 align:start position:0%
um criminal activity they had figured
 
00:45:29.870 --> 00:45:29.880 align:start position:0%
out a work a workflow to see if there
 
00:45:31.670 --> 00:45:31.680 align:start position:0%
was a criminal investigation going on
 
00:45:32.870 --> 00:45:32.880 align:start position:0%
and since
 
00:45:34.609 --> 00:45:34.619 align:start position:0%
they were able to figure out a workflow
 
00:45:36.349 --> 00:45:36.359 align:start position:0%
to make that work they didn't have any
 
00:45:39.109 --> 00:45:39.119 align:start position:0%
concerns with this and they were fully
 
00:45:42.470 --> 00:45:42.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:46.010 --> 00:45:46.020 align:start position:0%

this uh bill is
 
00:47:48.349 --> 00:47:48.359 align:start position:0%
a pretty good example of
 
00:47:50.930 --> 00:47:50.940 align:start position:0%
a solution looking for a problem in my
 
00:47:54.770 --> 00:47:54.780 align:start position:0%
opinion uh it's uh an example of
 
00:47:57.890 --> 00:47:57.900 align:start position:0%
codifying something that uh that the
 
00:48:00.710 --> 00:48:00.720 align:start position:0%
really only complicates a fairly simple
 
00:48:00.720 --> 00:48:01.910 align:start position:0%
really only complicates a fairly simple
matter

00:48:01.910 --> 00:48:01.920 align:start position:0%
matter
 
00:48:01.920 --> 00:48:03.770 align:start position:0%
matter
uh

uh
 
00:48:07.069 --> 00:48:07.079 align:start position:0%
and uh it actually does
 
00:48:09.290 --> 00:48:09.300 align:start position:0%
it does not improve
 
00:48:09.300 --> 00:48:10.370 align:start position:0%
it does not improve
uh

00:48:10.370 --> 00:48:10.380 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:48:13.849 --> 00:48:13.859 align:start position:0%

yes thank you
 
00:49:15.230 --> 00:49:15.240 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:49:18.890 --> 00:49:18.900 align:start position:0%
um what I'd like to do uh just be just
 
00:49:20.510 --> 00:49:20.520 align:start position:0%
in the interest of expediency I'd like
 
00:49:22.849 --> 00:49:22.859 align:start position:0%
to skip 255 for the moment and move on
 
00:49:26.569 --> 00:49:26.579 align:start position:0%
to uh SB 264 which I think will probably
 
00:49:29.990 --> 00:49:30.000 align:start position:0%
entail less less discussion uh and I'm
 
00:49:31.609 --> 00:49:31.619 align:start position:0%
going to rep recognize representative
 
00:49:33.470 --> 00:49:33.480 align:start position:0%
Manos for a motion
 
00:49:37.309 --> 00:49:37.319 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I move um OTP on this
 
00:49:39.650 --> 00:49:39.660 align:start position:0%
uh on this bill
 
00:49:42.530 --> 00:49:42.540 align:start position:0%
um this bill do we have a second I'll
 
00:49:45.290 --> 00:49:45.300 align:start position:0%
second all right representative Mass
 
00:49:46.550 --> 00:49:46.560 align:start position:0%
would you like to speak to your motion
 
00:49:49.190 --> 00:49:49.200 align:start position:0%
yes I would Mr chair thank you
 
00:49:51.829 --> 00:49:51.839 align:start position:0%
um this bill to a large extent is a
 
00:49:54.530 --> 00:49:54.540 align:start position:0%
housekeeping Bill and to a large extent
 
00:49:57.849 --> 00:49:57.859 align:start position:0%
um adds clarification to the statute and
 
00:50:01.790 --> 00:50:01.800 align:start position:0%
certainty to the statute I think uh also
 
00:50:06.589 --> 00:50:06.599 align:start position:0%
it improves the existing legislation by
 
00:50:10.150 --> 00:50:10.160 align:start position:0%
recognizing that parent
 
00:50:13.849 --> 00:50:13.859 align:start position:0%
that agreed upon carrier agreements I
 
00:50:16.430 --> 00:50:16.440 align:start position:0%
don't have the terminology right but uh
 
00:50:18.109 --> 00:50:18.119 align:start position:0%
carrier agreements
 
00:50:18.119 --> 00:50:19.010 align:start position:0%
carrier agreements
um

00:50:19.010 --> 00:50:19.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:21.710 --> 00:50:21.720 align:start position:0%
can substantially comply with the
 
00:50:25.069 --> 00:50:25.079 align:start position:0%
statute rather than literally comply
 
00:50:27.349 --> 00:50:27.359 align:start position:0%
with the statute and the purpose of that
 
00:50:31.069 --> 00:50:31.079 align:start position:0%
is so that practitioners in this area of
 
00:50:33.050 --> 00:50:33.060 align:start position:0%
law who make
 
00:50:33.060 --> 00:50:34.250 align:start position:0%
law who make
um

00:50:34.250 --> 00:50:34.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:36.530 --> 00:50:36.540 align:start position:0%
or agreements that don't technically
 
00:50:38.530 --> 00:50:38.540 align:start position:0%
comply with the law
 
00:50:41.390 --> 00:50:41.400 align:start position:0%
would substantially comply with it and
 
00:50:44.530 --> 00:50:44.540 align:start position:0%
therefore lead to certainty in the
 
00:50:48.049 --> 00:50:48.059 align:start position:0%
agreements I think practitioners who may
 
00:50:51.890 --> 00:50:51.900 align:start position:0%
be practice in other states or who make
 
00:50:54.549 --> 00:50:54.559 align:start position:0%
small technical errors
 
00:50:57.589 --> 00:50:57.599 align:start position:0%
that those agreements should continue to
 
00:50:59.990 --> 00:51:00.000 align:start position:0%
be recognized and so I support this
 
00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:01.309 align:start position:0%
be recognized and so I support this
legislation

00:51:01.309 --> 00:51:01.319 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:51:04.010 --> 00:51:04.020 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you anyone else wish to
 
00:51:06.109 --> 00:51:06.119 align:start position:0%
speak yes representative greeson thank
 
00:51:08.809 --> 00:51:08.819 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair after I read through this
 
00:51:13.130 --> 00:51:13.140 align:start position:0%
again there was a on page five
 
00:51:16.609 --> 00:51:16.619 align:start position:0%
Section 8 Roman numeral eight excuse me
 
00:51:20.450 --> 00:51:20.460 align:start position:0%
is in addition to the
 
00:51:22.430 --> 00:51:22.440 align:start position:0%
to the current law and it says nothing
 
00:51:24.530 --> 00:51:24.540 align:start position:0%
in this chapter is intended to abrogate
 
00:51:26.870 --> 00:51:26.880 align:start position:0%
any rights of the resulting child to
 
00:51:29.990 --> 00:51:30.000 align:start position:0%
pursue any legally authorized action and
 
00:51:31.790 --> 00:51:31.800 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering what this is supposed to
 
00:51:34.390 --> 00:51:34.400 align:start position:0%
mean what its intent is
 
00:51:38.990 --> 00:51:39.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:42.049 --> 00:51:42.059 align:start position:0%
it just it jumped out of me and raised
 
00:51:44.690 --> 00:51:44.700 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry you know what could you refer
 
00:51:47.030 --> 00:51:47.040 align:start position:0%
me again to watch where page five Roman
 
00:51:50.089 --> 00:51:50.099 align:start position:0%
numeral eight Roman numeral eight okay
 
00:51:53.329 --> 00:51:53.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:53.339 --> 00:51:57.470 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:51:57.470 --> 00:51:57.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:00.170 --> 00:52:00.180 align:start position:0%
you know I my I I don't know this for a
 
00:52:02.089 --> 00:52:02.099 align:start position:0%
fact but my inclination is that what
 
00:52:04.010 --> 00:52:04.020 align:start position:0%
this is intended to do is just to make
 
00:52:06.470 --> 00:52:06.480 align:start position:0%
it in other words if they're
 
00:52:09.290 --> 00:52:09.300 align:start position:0%
if there was
 
00:52:12.890 --> 00:52:12.900 align:start position:0%
a right
 
00:52:17.390 --> 00:52:17.400 align:start position:0%
for example if a if a if a child had
 
00:52:19.849 --> 00:52:19.859 align:start position:0%
let me sort of give this example if a if
 
00:52:23.030 --> 00:52:23.040 align:start position:0%
a child let's suppose that a child were
 
00:52:27.290 --> 00:52:27.300 align:start position:0%
was injured in utero by somebody
 
00:52:29.270 --> 00:52:29.280 align:start position:0%
assaulting the mother and it and not
 
00:52:30.589 --> 00:52:30.599 align:start position:0%
only injured the mother but injured the
 
00:52:30.599 --> 00:52:31.730 align:start position:0%
only injured the mother but injured the
child

00:52:31.730 --> 00:52:31.740 align:start position:0%
child
 
00:52:34.970 --> 00:52:34.980 align:start position:0%
um the child may very well have made
 
00:52:37.849 --> 00:52:37.859 align:start position:0%
very well I don't I'm not you know I
 
00:52:39.349 --> 00:52:39.359 align:start position:0%
haven't researched this issue it's just
 
00:52:40.670 --> 00:52:40.680 align:start position:0%
sort of I'm speaking kind of
 
00:52:42.470 --> 00:52:42.480 align:start position:0%
extemporaneously but the child might
 
00:52:43.670 --> 00:52:43.680 align:start position:0%
well have
 
00:52:46.010 --> 00:52:46.020 align:start position:0%
an action
 
00:52:47.750 --> 00:52:47.760 align:start position:0%
um once the child is born might well
 
00:52:49.849 --> 00:52:49.859 align:start position:0%
have an action against the whoever
 
00:52:51.890 --> 00:52:51.900 align:start position:0%
injured whoever injured the whoever
 
00:52:52.970 --> 00:52:52.980 align:start position:0%
injured it
 
00:52:52.980 --> 00:52:54.230 align:start position:0%
injured it
um

00:52:54.230 --> 00:52:54.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:56.750 --> 00:52:56.760 align:start position:0%
my my suspicion is that this was just
 
00:52:58.730 --> 00:52:58.740 align:start position:0%
added to say that
 
00:53:01.670 --> 00:53:01.680 align:start position:0%
the nothing the fact that they're that
 
00:53:05.210 --> 00:53:05.220 align:start position:0%
the child might be the product of of uh
 
00:53:07.910 --> 00:53:07.920 align:start position:0%
artificial insemination does not in any
 
00:53:10.849 --> 00:53:10.859 align:start position:0%
way abrogate you know rights that
 
00:53:13.370 --> 00:53:13.380 align:start position:0%
otherwise existed so that's I that might
 
00:53:15.230 --> 00:53:15.240 align:start position:0%
that's my suspicion is that this is just
 
00:53:17.690 --> 00:53:17.700 align:start position:0%
the you know sort of safety net don't
 
00:53:21.290 --> 00:53:21.300 align:start position:0%
don't uh nothing that nothing that in
 
00:53:23.630 --> 00:53:23.640 align:start position:0%
the the hole in vitro fertilization that
 
00:53:26.450 --> 00:53:26.460 align:start position:0%
kind of thing surrogate parentage not is
 
00:53:28.910 --> 00:53:28.920 align:start position:0%
not intended to diminish any rights that
 
00:53:30.890 --> 00:53:30.900 align:start position:0%
the child would otherwise have I that's
 
00:53:33.890 --> 00:53:33.900 align:start position:0%
that's the way I sort of read it
 
00:53:36.609 --> 00:53:36.619 align:start position:0%
is that a legal question now
 
00:53:39.290 --> 00:53:39.300 align:start position:0%
is that even in question now under
 
00:53:41.870 --> 00:53:41.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:44.569 --> 00:53:44.579 align:start position:0%
I don't I don't know if I mean I may I I
 
00:53:46.309 --> 00:53:46.319 align:start position:0%
don't but I guess somebody somebody I
 
00:53:47.750 --> 00:53:47.760 align:start position:0%
assume must have thought that maybe it
 
00:53:50.569 --> 00:53:50.579 align:start position:0%
could be and so that was uh you know I
 
00:53:53.030 --> 00:53:53.040 align:start position:0%
just read this as sort of a safety valve
 
00:53:57.109 --> 00:53:57.119 align:start position:0%
kind of thing not nobody in other words
 
00:53:58.790 --> 00:53:58.800 align:start position:0%
I don't know how valid this argument
 
00:54:00.470 --> 00:54:00.480 align:start position:0%
would be but I guess somebody might have
 
00:54:01.849 --> 00:54:01.859 align:start position:0%
been worried that
 
00:54:05.450 --> 00:54:05.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:08.030 --> 00:54:08.040 align:start position:0%
you know as a defense May in the example
 
00:54:10.250 --> 00:54:10.260 align:start position:0%
I gave somebody might say as a defense
 
00:54:12.349 --> 00:54:12.359 align:start position:0%
well no that might that doesn't apply
 
00:54:14.990 --> 00:54:15.000 align:start position:0%
here because this child was born in us
 
00:54:16.849 --> 00:54:16.859 align:start position:0%
out of a surrog as he said surrogacy
 
00:54:18.410 --> 00:54:18.420 align:start position:0%
situation I don't think that argument
 
00:54:19.849 --> 00:54:19.859 align:start position:0%
would carry much water but maybe
 
00:54:22.430 --> 00:54:22.440 align:start position:0%
somebody was concerned that you know
 
00:54:25.130 --> 00:54:25.140 align:start position:0%
let's let's let's nail this down
 
00:54:27.470 --> 00:54:27.480 align:start position:0%
completely to make sure that we that it
 
00:54:29.210 --> 00:54:29.220 align:start position:0%
can't be read that way
 
00:54:32.450 --> 00:54:32.460 align:start position:0%
so that I mean I I don't I guess I I
 
00:54:34.069 --> 00:54:34.079 align:start position:0%
guess what I would say is I don't see
 
00:54:36.290 --> 00:54:36.300 align:start position:0%
how it would be harmful since it doesn't
 
00:54:38.089 --> 00:54:38.099 align:start position:0%
purport to create
 
00:54:48.410 --> 00:54:48.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:49.910 --> 00:54:49.920 align:start position:0%
and I guess I should say is there if
 
00:54:53.450 --> 00:54:53.460 align:start position:0%
there's anybody here on 264 that has is
 
00:54:56.450 --> 00:54:56.460 align:start position:0%
you know more is is an expert in this
 
00:54:57.770 --> 00:54:57.780 align:start position:0%
area and you have something to say
 
00:54:59.450 --> 00:54:59.460 align:start position:0%
please uh
 
00:55:01.549 --> 00:55:01.559 align:start position:0%
would live
 
00:55:07.069 --> 00:55:07.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:08.569 --> 00:55:08.579 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm sorry could you just tell us
 
00:55:17.870 --> 00:55:17.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:19.970 --> 00:55:19.980 align:start position:0%
hi my name is Catherine Tucker I'm an
 
00:55:21.589 --> 00:55:21.599 align:start position:0%
attorney in the Concord area and I
 
00:55:23.089 --> 00:55:23.099 align:start position:0%
practice in this field of Law and I just
 
00:55:24.829 --> 00:55:24.839 align:start position:0%
want to say that that was there were
 
00:55:27.109 --> 00:55:27.119 align:start position:0%
some concerns brought up by um Senator
 
00:55:29.690 --> 00:55:29.700 align:start position:0%
Carson about what rights the fetus would
 
00:55:32.210 --> 00:55:32.220 align:start position:0%
or wouldn't have and so the way we
 
00:55:34.010 --> 00:55:34.020 align:start position:0%
addressed it is that we're not changing
 
00:55:35.690 --> 00:55:35.700 align:start position:0%
whatever rights the fetus does or
 
00:55:37.309 --> 00:55:37.319 align:start position:0%
doesn't have are not going to be
 
00:55:38.990 --> 00:55:39.000 align:start position:0%
impacted by this particular bill
 
00:55:42.230 --> 00:55:42.240 align:start position:0%
whatever they are stay in place as as is
 
00:55:46.190 --> 00:55:46.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:48.950 --> 00:55:48.960 align:start position:0%
all right any anybody anyone have any
 
00:55:48.960 --> 00:55:50.089 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr chair imove retain on House
 
00:57:35.569 --> 00:57:35.579 align:start position:0%
Bill 255. you're a second second
 
00:57:36.829 --> 00:57:36.839 align:start position:0%
has been made and seconded
 
00:57:38.270 --> 00:57:38.280 align:start position:0%
representative Smith would you like to
 
00:57:41.089 --> 00:57:41.099 align:start position:0%
speak to your motion yes I would like to
 
00:57:44.870 --> 00:57:44.880 align:start position:0%
speak to my motion this is an incredibly
 
00:57:47.030 --> 00:57:47.040 align:start position:0%
timely bill
 
00:57:50.809 --> 00:57:50.819 align:start position:0%
it is a very important bill
 
00:57:54.530 --> 00:57:54.540 align:start position:0%
we cannot open a newspaper I'm probably
 
00:57:56.150 --> 00:57:56.160 align:start position:0%
the only one here who still reads
 
00:57:57.829 --> 00:57:57.839 align:start position:0%
newspapers but
 
00:58:00.049 --> 00:58:00.059 align:start position:0%
um okay well maybe there's more do when
 
00:58:01.250 --> 00:58:01.260 align:start position:0%
it when they actually managed to deliver
 
00:58:04.730 --> 00:58:04.740 align:start position:0%
it to me uh
 
00:58:08.950 --> 00:58:08.960 align:start position:0%
uh without understanding how relevant
 
00:58:12.790 --> 00:58:12.800 align:start position:0%
this issue is and how unbelievably
 
00:58:17.329 --> 00:58:17.339 align:start position:0%
complicated it is and for
 
00:58:21.170 --> 00:58:21.180 align:start position:0%
um while we understand that other states
 
00:58:24.530 --> 00:58:24.540 align:start position:0%
have moved ahead
 
00:58:28.190 --> 00:58:28.200 align:start position:0%
um on legislation that is pretty close
 
00:58:32.690 --> 00:58:32.700 align:start position:0%
to this and so we're not out there on
 
00:58:34.510 --> 00:58:34.520 align:start position:0%
there on our own
 
00:58:38.569 --> 00:58:38.579 align:start position:0%
nonetheless New Hampshire likes to march
 
00:58:40.730 --> 00:58:40.740 align:start position:0%
to its own drummer and to be
 
00:58:44.870 --> 00:58:44.880 align:start position:0%
particularly careful since we are such a
 
00:58:48.049 --> 00:58:48.059 align:start position:0%
small state and it is easy for everyone
 
00:58:50.630 --> 00:58:50.640 align:start position:0%
in the state to be affected and if we
 
00:58:54.470 --> 00:58:54.480 align:start position:0%
were Cavalier in our decisions
 
00:58:57.890 --> 00:58:57.900 align:start position:0%
it could come back to haunt us
 
00:58:57.900 --> 00:58:58.990 align:start position:0%
it could come back to haunt us
um

00:58:58.990 --> 00:58:59.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:02.450 --> 00:59:02.460 align:start position:0%
I personally believe this should be a
 
00:59:05.150 --> 00:59:05.160 align:start position:0%
federal issue I am glad that there are
 
00:59:07.849 --> 00:59:07.859 align:start position:0%
other states coming forward with
 
00:59:10.309 --> 00:59:10.319 align:start position:0%
versions of this and hope that that will
 
00:59:13.430 --> 00:59:13.440 align:start position:0%
encourage uh the government in
 
00:59:15.650 --> 00:59:15.660 align:start position:0%
Washington to recognize that they should
 
00:59:17.750 --> 00:59:17.760 align:start position:0%
step up to the plate
 
00:59:21.049 --> 00:59:21.059 align:start position:0%
but that not being the case now I would
 
00:59:22.809 --> 00:59:22.819 align:start position:0%
like to make sure
 
00:59:27.650 --> 00:59:27.660 align:start position:0%
that the questions that we have and some
 
00:59:30.289 --> 00:59:30.299 align:start position:0%
of us many of us have questions that
 
00:59:32.569 --> 00:59:32.579 align:start position:0%
aren't the same which in itself is an
 
00:59:35.750 --> 00:59:35.760 align:start position:0%
indication of how complex it is that we
 
00:59:38.210 --> 00:59:38.220 align:start position:0%
in effect delay our action on this for
 
00:59:41.089 --> 00:59:41.099 align:start position:0%
six months which is what it would be
 
00:59:44.390 --> 00:59:44.400 align:start position:0%
with the expectation that the committee
 
00:59:46.370 --> 00:59:46.380 align:start position:0%
would work
 
00:59:46.380 --> 00:59:47.289 align:start position:0%
would work
um

00:59:47.289 --> 00:59:47.299 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:51.470 --> 00:59:51.480 align:start position:0%
diligently with uh all interested
 
00:59:54.349 --> 00:59:54.359 align:start position:0%
parties in the legislature and out in
 
00:59:56.329 --> 00:59:56.339 align:start position:0%
order to make sure that what New
 
00:59:59.210 --> 00:59:59.220 align:start position:0%
Hampshire produces is the best possible
 
00:59:59.220 --> 01:00:00.170 align:start position:0%
Hampshire produces is the best possible
bill

01:00:00.170 --> 01:00:00.180 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:00:02.390 --> 01:00:02.400 align:start position:0%
that we could produce for this state
 
01:00:04.970 --> 01:00:04.980 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair all right other
 
01:00:07.490 --> 01:00:07.500 align:start position:0%
people wish to speak representative horn
 
01:00:09.710 --> 01:00:09.720 align:start position:0%
um yes I mean this issue isn't going
 
01:00:11.270 --> 01:00:11.280 align:start position:0%
away and this bill isn't going away
 
01:00:12.829 --> 01:00:12.839 align:start position:0%
there's a broad
 
01:00:14.630 --> 01:00:14.640 align:start position:0%
there's a broad Coalition which is
 
01:00:16.309 --> 01:00:16.319 align:start position:0%
working on it and this was certainly a
 
01:00:17.750 --> 01:00:17.760 align:start position:0%
vast improvement over
 
01:00:19.430 --> 01:00:19.440 align:start position:0%
the previous bills because at least it
 
01:00:22.730 --> 01:00:22.740 align:start position:0%
did take the interests of the
 
01:00:24.650 --> 01:00:24.660 align:start position:0%
you know the online
 
01:00:27.170 --> 01:00:27.180 align:start position:0%
the industry the information Services
 
01:00:30.230 --> 01:00:30.240 align:start position:0%
the online industry into account lots of
 
01:00:31.849 --> 01:00:31.859 align:start position:0%
services we use
 
01:00:33.770 --> 01:00:33.780 align:start position:0%
to reserve a trade-off where we give
 
01:00:34.970 --> 01:00:34.980 align:start position:0%
away a little bit of our private
 
01:00:37.069 --> 01:00:37.079 align:start position:0%
information in exchange for a free or
 
01:00:40.789 --> 01:00:40.799 align:start position:0%
low-cost service and that's um
 
01:00:42.829 --> 01:00:42.839 align:start position:0%
that's just when the underpinnings of
 
01:00:44.530 --> 01:00:44.540 align:start position:0%
our economy and certainly needs to be
 
01:00:47.630 --> 01:00:47.640 align:start position:0%
certainly needs to be regulated but I'm
 
01:00:49.190 --> 01:00:49.200 align:start position:0%
not sure if this bill
 
01:00:51.950 --> 01:00:51.960 align:start position:0%
is the right vehicle to do it and but
 
01:00:53.329 --> 01:00:53.339 align:start position:0%
people are working on it will be
 
01:00:55.309 --> 01:00:55.319 align:start position:0%
improved and it does have both users and
 
01:00:57.230 --> 01:00:57.240 align:start position:0%
providers and I've been a
 
01:00:59.329 --> 01:00:59.339 align:start position:0%
provider internet services on a very
 
01:01:01.609 --> 01:01:01.619 align:start position:0%
very tiny scale I still have a website I
 
01:01:03.650 --> 01:01:03.660 align:start position:0%
still know what they call like virtual
 
01:01:05.329 --> 01:01:05.339 align:start position:0%
land in the virtual world second life
 
01:01:06.589 --> 01:01:06.599 align:start position:0%
and as a
 
01:01:08.510 --> 01:01:08.520 align:start position:0%
provider I have
 
01:01:10.849 --> 01:01:10.859 align:start position:0%
I've I actually have the right I have to
 
01:01:12.950 --> 01:01:12.960 align:start position:0%
protect the I mean I've like protect the
 
01:01:14.750 --> 01:01:14.760 align:start position:0%
privacy of the people who are there but
 
01:01:17.510 --> 01:01:17.520 align:start position:0%
also I have the right to know who's you
 
01:01:20.569 --> 01:01:20.579 align:start position:0%
know who's using the uh server that I'm
 
01:01:22.730 --> 01:01:22.740 align:start position:0%
leasing who's using who's on the virtual
 
01:01:25.010 --> 01:01:25.020 align:start position:0%
land and in some cases uh
 
01:01:26.630 --> 01:01:26.640 align:start position:0%
those can be
 
01:01:29.210 --> 01:01:29.220 align:start position:0%
those can be uh those can be abused you
 
01:01:30.250 --> 01:01:30.260 align:start position:0%
know there's
 
01:01:32.630 --> 01:01:32.640 align:start position:0%
terrorists child pornographers all kinds
 
01:01:34.910 --> 01:01:34.920 align:start position:0%
of Bad actors and there's also just uh
 
01:01:35.990 --> 01:01:36.000 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:01:38.329 --> 01:01:38.339 align:start position:0%
scam artists on there so I have to write
 
01:01:40.010 --> 01:01:40.020 align:start position:0%
and actually even the duty to a certain
 
01:01:41.870 --> 01:01:41.880 align:start position:0%
extent to uh
 
01:01:44.809 --> 01:01:44.819 align:start position:0%
uh protect protect protect my interests
 
01:01:47.150 --> 01:01:47.160 align:start position:0%
and that involves uh at least some
 
01:01:48.890 --> 01:01:48.900 align:start position:0%
extent having some idea of who it is
 
01:01:51.589 --> 01:01:51.599 align:start position:0%
who's using my little bit of bandwidth
 
01:01:54.710 --> 01:01:54.720 align:start position:0%
that I'm I'm making available so that's
 
01:01:57.109 --> 01:01:57.119 align:start position:0%
uh obviously I was about like one
 
01:01:59.150 --> 01:01:59.160 align:start position:0%
trillionth the scale of Microsoft who
 
01:02:01.190 --> 01:02:01.200 align:start position:0%
came to talk to us but I do
 
01:02:03.470 --> 01:02:03.480 align:start position:0%
at least sort of understand that there's
 
01:02:05.030 --> 01:02:05.040 align:start position:0%
you know there's rights and there's
 
01:02:07.069 --> 01:02:07.079 align:start position:0%
concerns on the other side of the scale
 
01:02:09.470 --> 01:02:09.480 align:start position:0%
not just for the users so
 
01:02:09.480 --> 01:02:10.069 align:start position:0%
not just for the users so
um

01:02:10.069 --> 01:02:10.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:02:11.870 --> 01:02:11.880 align:start position:0%
anyway I'm sure this group is working
 
01:02:14.089 --> 01:02:14.099 align:start position:0%
the bill will be working on new new
 
01:02:17.030 --> 01:02:17.040 align:start position:0%
versions of it anyway this as we I guess
 
01:02:18.589 --> 01:02:18.599 align:start position:0%
it's not part of the uniform law
 
01:02:20.329 --> 01:02:20.339 align:start position:0%
commission but it is through a similar
 
01:02:22.849 --> 01:02:22.859 align:start position:0%
process I think certainly retaining it
 
01:02:24.589 --> 01:02:24.599 align:start position:0%
over the summer to look at the issue a
 
01:02:26.569 --> 01:02:26.579 align:start position:0%
little bit more depth is definitely the
 
01:02:28.069 --> 01:02:28.079 align:start position:0%
appropriate thing to do at this time and
 
01:02:30.650 --> 01:02:30.660 align:start position:0%
I'll vote for that motion thanks other
 
01:02:32.270 --> 01:02:32.280 align:start position:0%
people wish to speak
 
01:02:35.630 --> 01:02:35.640 align:start position:0%
um representative Turner uh yeah um I I
 
01:02:38.450 --> 01:02:38.460 align:start position:0%
also uh favor the idea of retain for
 
01:02:40.849 --> 01:02:40.859 align:start position:0%
this bill for for a couple of different
 
01:02:43.789 --> 01:02:43.799 align:start position:0%
reasons some related to sort of the
 
01:02:46.010 --> 01:02:46.020 align:start position:0%
language of the bill and particularly we
 
01:02:48.170 --> 01:02:48.180 align:start position:0%
heard some conflicting testimony around
 
01:02:51.230 --> 01:02:51.240 align:start position:0%
the scope of of what organizations would
 
01:02:53.569 --> 01:02:53.579 align:start position:0%
be covered you know whether it's a
 
01:02:55.190 --> 01:02:55.200 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand New Hampshire residents
 
01:02:57.289 --> 01:02:57.299 align:start position:0%
or a hundred thousand
 
01:02:59.930 --> 01:02:59.940 align:start position:0%
um uh total users of these bills and
 
01:03:01.670 --> 01:03:01.680 align:start position:0%
some other technical issues my other
 
01:03:03.530 --> 01:03:03.540 align:start position:0%
concern is logistically we definitely
 
01:03:05.690 --> 01:03:05.700 align:start position:0%
heard from the Attorney General's office
 
01:03:09.890 --> 01:03:09.900 align:start position:0%
that they're overburdened as it is and
 
01:03:12.609 --> 01:03:12.619 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note on this basically
 
01:03:15.289 --> 01:03:15.299 align:start position:0%
suggests that this could add significant
 
01:03:17.270 --> 01:03:17.280 align:start position:0%
additional burden and and we learned
 
01:03:17.280 --> 01:03:18.049 align:start position:0%
additional burden and and we learned
that

01:03:18.049 --> 01:03:18.059 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:03:21.170 --> 01:03:21.180 align:start position:0%
that they're the the fund that would
 
01:03:23.030 --> 01:03:23.040 align:start position:0%
support this is capped and they don't
 
01:03:25.130 --> 01:03:25.140 align:start position:0%
really have the ability to to get the
 
01:03:28.190 --> 01:03:28.200 align:start position:0%
resources to act on it even if they had
 
01:03:30.289 --> 01:03:30.299 align:start position:0%
the authority so I think for those
 
01:03:32.390 --> 01:03:32.400 align:start position:0%
reasons I would like to see us work on
 
01:03:35.569 --> 01:03:35.579 align:start position:0%
on the bill further acknowledging that
 
01:03:37.910 --> 01:03:37.920 align:start position:0%
that there's there is a real issue and
 
01:03:41.030 --> 01:03:41.040 align:start position:0%
and to the urgency I believe is is less
 
01:03:43.549 --> 01:03:43.559 align:start position:0%
in that because other states are moving
 
01:03:44.930 --> 01:03:44.940 align:start position:0%
forward we heard that many of the
 
01:03:44.940 --> 01:03:46.490 align:start position:0%
forward we heard that many of the
providers

01:03:46.490 --> 01:03:46.500 align:start position:0%
providers
 
01:03:48.470 --> 01:03:48.480 align:start position:0%
um of these resources are already having
 
01:03:50.329 --> 01:03:50.339 align:start position:0%
to put steps in place to comply with
 
01:03:53.510 --> 01:03:53.520 align:start position:0%
other state rules that move us closer
 
01:03:57.170 --> 01:03:57.180 align:start position:0%
other yes representative
 
01:03:59.690 --> 01:03:59.700 align:start position:0%
so I had debated back and forth for
 
01:04:03.530 --> 01:04:03.540 align:start position:0%
similar reasons expressed on this bill
 
01:04:06.650 --> 01:04:06.660 align:start position:0%
however ultimately I I did like the
 
01:04:08.630 --> 01:04:08.640 align:start position:0%
amendment that chairman Lane had come up
 
01:04:11.270 --> 01:04:11.280 align:start position:0%
with you know clarifying that the users
 
01:04:13.609 --> 01:04:13.619 align:start position:0%
per year I did think that addressed that
 
01:04:15.470 --> 01:04:15.480 align:start position:0%
issue and I think
 
01:04:17.270 --> 01:04:17.280 align:start position:0%
while we'd like to think we're protected
 
01:04:20.809 --> 01:04:20.819 align:start position:0%
by what other states have we have no
 
01:04:23.030 --> 01:04:23.040 align:start position:0%
way of enforcing any of it because it's
 
01:04:25.549 --> 01:04:25.559 align:start position:0%
not our statue and I think adding this
 
01:04:28.010 --> 01:04:28.020 align:start position:0%
isn't going to do any harm but yes I do
 
01:04:29.390 --> 01:04:29.400 align:start position:0%
agree that the Attorney General's office
 
01:04:31.609 --> 01:04:31.619 align:start position:0%
may not necessarily have the capacity to
 
01:04:33.109 --> 01:04:33.119 align:start position:0%
enforce something like this but let's
 
01:04:37.010 --> 01:04:37.020 align:start position:0%
say there were to be parties that were
 
01:04:39.410 --> 01:04:39.420 align:start position:0%
harmed from this
 
01:04:41.450 --> 01:04:41.460 align:start position:0%
at that point they would at least have
 
01:04:42.950 --> 01:04:42.960 align:start position:0%
the authority
 
01:04:45.829 --> 01:04:45.839 align:start position:0%
to do something right now nothing could
 
01:04:47.390 --> 01:04:47.400 align:start position:0%
happen if somebody was harmed and I
 
01:04:49.309 --> 01:04:49.319 align:start position:0%
think this committee has a lot of other
 
01:04:53.990 --> 01:04:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:57.170 --> 01:04:57.180 align:start position:0%
perhaps is more relevant to the current
 
01:04:59.930 --> 01:04:59.940 align:start position:0%
time in terms of like the the HRC like
 
01:05:03.109 --> 01:05:03.119 align:start position:0%
that needs a lot of work I think
 
01:05:04.849 --> 01:05:04.859 align:start position:0%
if at some point the federal government
 
01:05:06.470 --> 01:05:06.480 align:start position:0%
is to put something in we can always
 
01:05:08.450 --> 01:05:08.460 align:start position:0%
repeal our statue or if this statue
 
01:05:09.890 --> 01:05:09.900 align:start position:0%
wasn't working we could always add
 
01:05:12.109 --> 01:05:12.119 align:start position:0%
something in but I don't see at least if
 
01:05:13.609 --> 01:05:13.619 align:start position:0%
we put something in there is something
 
01:05:15.289 --> 01:05:15.299 align:start position:0%
that you providing some sort of
 
01:05:16.609 --> 01:05:16.619 align:start position:0%
protection that the Attorney General
 
01:05:19.490 --> 01:05:19.500 align:start position:0%
could do something if somebody were to
 
01:05:20.990 --> 01:05:21.000 align:start position:0%
be harmed and
 
01:05:23.690 --> 01:05:23.700 align:start position:0%
I I think leaving it behind I guess just
 
01:05:26.150 --> 01:05:26.160 align:start position:0%
doesn't allow us any course of action at
 
01:05:27.829 --> 01:05:27.839 align:start position:0%
all if something were to happen and I I
 
01:05:29.630 --> 01:05:29.640 align:start position:0%
know there was discussion about private
 
01:05:31.549 --> 01:05:31.559 align:start position:0%
right of action and I think you know at
 
01:05:33.289 --> 01:05:33.299 align:start position:0%
first I was in favor of it but then
 
01:05:33.299 --> 01:05:34.970 align:start position:0%
first I was in favor of it but then
ultimately

01:05:34.970 --> 01:05:34.980 align:start position:0%
ultimately
 
01:05:37.670 --> 01:05:37.680 align:start position:0%
as I discussed it further it came to
 
01:05:39.230 --> 01:05:39.240 align:start position:0%
light that well a lot of times when that
 
01:05:41.930 --> 01:05:41.940 align:start position:0%
happens it's really attorneys who are
 
01:05:43.069 --> 01:05:43.079 align:start position:0%
getting rich off of that right and
 
01:05:44.630 --> 01:05:44.640 align:start position:0%
they're doing class action lawsuits and
 
01:05:46.010 --> 01:05:46.020 align:start position:0%
it's not actually the person who's even
 
01:05:48.890 --> 01:05:48.900 align:start position:0%
harmed that's even benefiting off of it
 
01:05:50.930 --> 01:05:50.940 align:start position:0%
um and so I wouldn't want that to happen
 
01:05:52.549 --> 01:05:52.559 align:start position:0%
and at the same time if you made it
 
01:05:54.829 --> 01:05:54.839 align:start position:0%
smaller that only that person could go
 
01:05:56.750 --> 01:05:56.760 align:start position:0%
after for a private right of action then
 
01:05:58.789 --> 01:05:58.799 align:start position:0%
there's also the concern of are we going
 
01:06:00.770 --> 01:06:00.780 align:start position:0%
to have a bunch of you know frivolous
 
01:06:03.410 --> 01:06:03.420 align:start position:0%
lawsuits where you know Facebook and
 
01:06:05.390 --> 01:06:05.400 align:start position:0%
Microsoft who aren't even located in New
 
01:06:07.730 --> 01:06:07.740 align:start position:0%
Hampshire would be forced to either send
 
01:06:10.750 --> 01:06:10.760 align:start position:0%
somebody to respond on their behalf or
 
01:06:12.710 --> 01:06:12.720 align:start position:0%
potentially have a default judgment
 
01:06:15.829 --> 01:06:15.839 align:start position:0%
issued against them and so I can see why
 
01:06:17.270 --> 01:06:17.280 align:start position:0%
the private action right of action
 
01:06:18.950 --> 01:06:18.960 align:start position:0%
wasn't in there but I do like at least
 
01:06:20.930 --> 01:06:20.940 align:start position:0%
the AG's office could do something and
 
01:06:23.150 --> 01:06:23.160 align:start position:0%
he could potentially get the damages for
 
01:06:24.950 --> 01:06:24.960 align:start position:0%
somebody if if something were to happen
 
01:06:24.960 --> 01:06:26.270 align:start position:0%
somebody if if something were to happen
so

01:06:26.270 --> 01:06:26.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:06:28.609 --> 01:06:28.619 align:start position:0%
um I personally would
 
01:06:28.619 --> 01:06:30.349 align:start position:0%
um I personally would
support

01:06:30.349 --> 01:06:30.359 align:start position:0%
support
 
01:06:30.359 --> 01:06:31.549 align:start position:0%
support
um

01:06:31.549 --> 01:06:31.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:31.559 --> 01:06:33.109 align:start position:0%
um
passing

01:06:33.109 --> 01:06:33.119 align:start position:0%
passing
 
01:06:34.609 --> 01:06:34.619 align:start position:0%
um passing it with the amendment that
 
01:06:38.569 --> 01:06:38.579 align:start position:0%
that replyn has provided and I
 
01:06:39.829 --> 01:06:39.839 align:start position:0%
I just think that that's worth
 
01:06:42.349 --> 01:06:42.359 align:start position:0%
considering rather than putting it off
 
01:06:43.730 --> 01:06:43.740 align:start position:0%
um and retaining it because I'm not sure
 
01:06:46.010 --> 01:06:46.020 align:start position:0%
what we can really make better in the
 
01:06:48.829 --> 01:06:48.839 align:start position:0%
next six months so thank you
 
01:06:48.839 --> 01:06:49.490 align:start position:0%
next six months so thank you
um

01:06:49.490 --> 01:06:49.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:51.710 --> 01:06:51.720 align:start position:0%
yes representative Alexander thank you
 
01:06:54.109 --> 01:06:54.119 align:start position:0%
Mr chair I like to agree with my friend
 
01:06:56.630 --> 01:06:56.640 align:start position:0%
representative Smith from Durham as much
 
01:06:58.549 --> 01:06:58.559 align:start position:0%
as I can and I actually do agree with
 
01:07:00.470 --> 01:07:00.480 align:start position:0%
her in this situation
 
01:07:02.089 --> 01:07:02.099 align:start position:0%
um there's another bill that this
 
01:07:04.069 --> 01:07:04.079 align:start position:0%
committee retained regarding privacy and
 
01:07:06.529 --> 01:07:06.539 align:start position:0%
that dealt primarily with governmental
 
01:07:10.010 --> 01:07:10.020 align:start position:0%
units and I feel pretty strongly that if
 
01:07:11.630 --> 01:07:11.640 align:start position:0%
we're going to regulate private business
 
01:07:13.670 --> 01:07:13.680 align:start position:0%
we should start by regulating ourselves
 
01:07:17.029 --> 01:07:17.039 align:start position:0%
first so I'd like to see it retained and
 
01:07:17.039 --> 01:07:18.230 align:start position:0%
first so I'd like to see it retained and
maybe

01:07:18.230 --> 01:07:18.240 align:start position:0%
maybe
 
01:07:19.730 --> 01:07:19.740 align:start position:0%
um I'm sure there'll be a lot more
 
01:07:21.289 --> 01:07:21.299 align:start position:0%
people at the hearing if we add
 
01:07:22.910 --> 01:07:22.920 align:start position:0%
government units right now it's just
 
01:07:25.250 --> 01:07:25.260 align:start position:0%
private but I'd like to see it retain as
 
01:07:27.289 --> 01:07:27.299 align:start position:0%
well thank you all right uh other
 
01:07:30.410 --> 01:07:30.420 align:start position:0%
comment uh representative I'm sorry
 
01:07:33.470 --> 01:07:33.480 align:start position:0%
representative Andrew yes
 
01:07:37.010 --> 01:07:37.020 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I am very happy we
 
01:07:40.490 --> 01:07:40.500 align:start position:0%
have the motion to retain this bill I
 
01:07:42.490 --> 01:07:42.500 align:start position:0%
believe there's very many
 
01:07:44.930 --> 01:07:44.940 align:start position:0%
unanswered questions
 
01:07:46.549 --> 01:07:46.559 align:start position:0%
and I concur with everything
 
01:07:49.010 --> 01:07:49.020 align:start position:0%
representative Smith said
 
01:07:51.410 --> 01:07:51.420 align:start position:0%
we need to answer these questions and in
 
01:07:53.210 --> 01:07:53.220 align:start position:0%
the ultimate end
 
01:07:56.750 --> 01:07:56.760 align:start position:0%
my only thing is protecting the people
 
01:07:59.690 --> 01:07:59.700 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire other than that I don't
 
01:08:02.870 --> 01:08:02.880 align:start position:0%
care about the big companies I'm sorry
 
01:08:05.569 --> 01:08:05.579 align:start position:0%
I don't care about the big companies and
 
01:08:07.309 --> 01:08:07.319 align:start position:0%
you know what they're doing and what
 
01:08:09.410 --> 01:08:09.420 align:start position:0%
they aren't doing I'm only concerned
 
01:08:12.109 --> 01:08:12.119 align:start position:0%
with the people of New Hampshire and I
 
01:08:14.329 --> 01:08:14.339 align:start position:0%
don't agree with maybe passing something
 
01:08:17.689 --> 01:08:17.699 align:start position:0%
and then make changes because sometimes
 
01:08:20.990 --> 01:08:21.000 align:start position:0%
when we pass things we eat words after
 
01:08:23.689 --> 01:08:23.699 align:start position:0%
and sometimes things can't be changed so
 
01:08:25.370 --> 01:08:25.380 align:start position:0%
I'm very happy that we're going to vote
 
01:08:27.829 --> 01:08:27.839 align:start position:0%
to retain thank you
 
01:08:30.530 --> 01:08:30.540 align:start position:0%
so representative Stapleton
 
01:08:32.870 --> 01:08:32.880 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um
 
01:08:35.990 --> 01:08:36.000 align:start position:0%
I'm in favor of a retain but I
 
01:08:37.910 --> 01:08:37.920 align:start position:0%
appreciate the remarks of Representative
 
01:08:42.530 --> 01:08:42.540 align:start position:0%
guptab on the right of action
 
01:08:42.540 --> 01:08:43.130 align:start position:0%
guptab on the right of action
um

01:08:43.130 --> 01:08:43.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:47.269 --> 01:08:47.279 align:start position:0%
the bill is is written toward the AG's
 
01:08:49.789 --> 01:08:49.799 align:start position:0%
office handling the complaint as the
 
01:08:51.590 --> 01:08:51.600 align:start position:0%
sole Focus for this
 
01:08:54.050 --> 01:08:54.060 align:start position:0%
I think that there needs some work to
 
01:08:56.269 --> 01:08:56.279 align:start position:0%
see if there's room for private right of
 
01:09:00.430 --> 01:09:00.440 align:start position:0%
action or if not class action
 
01:09:04.070 --> 01:09:04.080 align:start position:0%
so I think that needs work to reconcile
 
01:09:07.430 --> 01:09:07.440 align:start position:0%
those interests on the other thing that
 
01:09:10.370 --> 01:09:10.380 align:start position:0%
I was Disturbed with was the lack of any
 
01:09:13.729 --> 01:09:13.739 align:start position:0%
monetary evaluation in the financial
 
01:09:13.739 --> 01:09:15.050 align:start position:0%
monetary evaluation in the financial
note

01:09:15.050 --> 01:09:15.060 align:start position:0%
note
 
01:09:17.450 --> 01:09:17.460 align:start position:0%
and I was able to pick up the minutes
 
01:09:21.410 --> 01:09:21.420 align:start position:0%
from the Senate hearing and um
 
01:09:23.990 --> 01:09:24.000 align:start position:0%
Brandon garage a senior Assistant
 
01:09:27.229 --> 01:09:27.239 align:start position:0%
Attorney General at the New Hampshire
 
01:09:27.239 --> 01:09:28.970 align:start position:0%
Attorney General at the New Hampshire
um

01:09:28.970 --> 01:09:28.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:09:31.550 --> 01:09:31.560 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office had had this
 
01:09:34.550 --> 01:09:34.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:38.090 --> 01:09:38.100 align:start position:0%
if said he said if this bill were passed
 
01:09:40.189 --> 01:09:40.199 align:start position:0%
into law today given the current makeup
 
01:09:41.990 --> 01:09:42.000 align:start position:0%
of the consumer protection and
 
01:09:44.269 --> 01:09:44.279 align:start position:0%
Anti-Trust Bureau
 
01:09:46.849 --> 01:09:46.859 align:start position:0%
this would be an impossible Bill to
 
01:09:49.729 --> 01:09:49.739 align:start position:0%
enforce the consumer protection and
 
01:09:52.130 --> 01:09:52.140 align:start position:0%
antitrust Bureau is responsible for the
 
01:09:54.709 --> 01:09:54.719 align:start position:0%
review and response to thousands of
 
01:09:57.050 --> 01:09:57.060 align:start position:0%
consumer complaints that are received
 
01:09:58.189 --> 01:09:58.199 align:start position:0%
each year
 
01:10:00.350 --> 01:10:00.360 align:start position:0%
they are also responsible for
 
01:10:02.630 --> 01:10:02.640 align:start position:0%
investigating proposed mergers in the
 
01:10:02.640 --> 01:10:03.709 align:start position:0%
investigating proposed mergers in the
state

01:10:03.709 --> 01:10:03.719 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:10:06.050 --> 01:10:06.060 align:start position:0%
he believed
 
01:10:09.050 --> 01:10:09.060 align:start position:0%
he believed that this entirely new
 
01:10:11.990 --> 01:10:12.000 align:start position:0%
chapter would only add on to the
 
01:10:13.850 --> 01:10:13.860 align:start position:0%
responsibilities of the consumer
 
01:10:16.669 --> 01:10:16.679 align:start position:0%
protection and Anti-Trust Bureau
 
01:10:19.250 --> 01:10:19.260 align:start position:0%
which could not be effectively enforced
 
01:10:22.490 --> 01:10:22.500 align:start position:0%
without additional resources he said the
 
01:10:25.070 --> 01:10:25.080 align:start position:0%
additional resources would take the form
 
01:10:27.590 --> 01:10:27.600 align:start position:0%
of additional staff additional attorneys
 
01:10:31.970 --> 01:10:31.980 align:start position:0%
and at least one more investigator
 
01:10:34.250 --> 01:10:34.260 align:start position:0%
so essentially you'd have to create
 
01:10:37.610 --> 01:10:37.620 align:start position:0%
somewhat of a bureau or Commission
 
01:10:41.209 --> 01:10:41.219 align:start position:0%
and from zero on the FN it could be a
 
01:10:42.770 --> 01:10:42.780 align:start position:0%
million or whatever
 
01:10:46.450 --> 01:10:46.460 align:start position:0%
and and I think for that reason and the
 
01:10:48.709 --> 01:10:48.719 align:start position:0%
reconciling of
 
01:10:52.070 --> 01:10:52.080 align:start position:0%
AG handle and right of
 
01:10:55.729 --> 01:10:55.739 align:start position:0%
right of action and class action that we
 
01:10:58.550 --> 01:10:58.560 align:start position:0%
we should work on this further with a
 
01:10:58.560 --> 01:11:00.130 align:start position:0%
we should work on this further with a
retained

01:11:00.130 --> 01:11:00.140 align:start position:0%
retained
 
01:11:03.050 --> 01:11:03.060 align:start position:0%
then other other Comics uh
 
01:11:05.450 --> 01:11:05.460 align:start position:0%
representative tur yeah I I just wanted
 
01:11:07.729 --> 01:11:07.739 align:start position:0%
to sort of also lift up
 
01:11:10.070 --> 01:11:10.080 align:start position:0%
um what representative could have
 
01:11:12.470 --> 01:11:12.480 align:start position:0%
um said uh I think the amendment which
 
01:11:14.270 --> 01:11:14.280 align:start position:0%
assuming if we go toward a routine I
 
01:11:16.790 --> 01:11:16.800 align:start position:0%
guess we're not going to hear that
 
01:11:18.470 --> 01:11:18.480 align:start position:0%
um moves things forward the only
 
01:11:21.350 --> 01:11:21.360 align:start position:0%
clarification I wanted to make
 
01:11:24.470 --> 01:11:24.480 align:start position:0%
um on that is we have the term consumer
 
01:11:27.110 --> 01:11:27.120 align:start position:0%
in you know still in the language and in
 
01:11:28.790 --> 01:11:28.800 align:start position:0%
in that Amendment and the the bill
 
01:11:30.590 --> 01:11:30.600 align:start position:0%
defines consumer as a New Hampshire
 
01:11:33.169 --> 01:11:33.179 align:start position:0%
resident and I think we had heard during
 
01:11:34.910 --> 01:11:34.920 align:start position:0%
the the
 
01:11:34.920 --> 01:11:35.630 align:start position:0%
the the
um

01:11:35.630 --> 01:11:35.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:11:38.030 --> 01:11:38.040 align:start position:0%
testimony that the true intent was a
 
01:11:39.830 --> 01:11:39.840 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand
 
01:11:42.350 --> 01:11:42.360 align:start position:0%
um consumers or a hundred thousand users
 
01:11:44.950 --> 01:11:44.960 align:start position:0%
across their entire scope of business
 
01:11:47.990 --> 01:11:48.000 align:start position:0%
otherwise this would would lead to a
 
01:11:49.669 --> 01:11:49.679 align:start position:0%
very narrow
 
01:11:52.370 --> 01:11:52.380 align:start position:0%
um scope that that this pertains to so I
 
01:11:55.070 --> 01:11:55.080 align:start position:0%
just wanted to clarify uh what I was
 
01:11:57.410 --> 01:11:57.420 align:start position:0%
saying earlier about about that that
 
01:11:59.330 --> 01:11:59.340 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand limit it wasn't the
 
01:12:01.970 --> 01:12:01.980 align:start position:0%
number as much as it was
 
01:12:04.130 --> 01:12:04.140 align:start position:0%
um that term consumer and whether that
 
01:12:06.410 --> 01:12:06.420 align:start position:0%
can term consumers really what what we
 
01:12:08.810 --> 01:12:08.820 align:start position:0%
should have but uh again still speaking
 
01:12:10.490 --> 01:12:10.500 align:start position:0%
in favor of retaining
 
01:12:14.030 --> 01:12:14.040 align:start position:0%
right right representative Smith
 
01:12:16.729 --> 01:12:16.739 align:start position:0%
thank you perhaps nothing else needs to
 
01:12:21.770 --> 01:12:21.780 align:start position:0%
be said but um I do want to mention two
 
01:12:23.510 --> 01:12:23.520 align:start position:0%
things first
 
01:12:26.810 --> 01:12:26.820 align:start position:0%
um in terms of the the testimony that
 
01:12:29.810 --> 01:12:29.820 align:start position:0%
representative Singleton just
 
01:12:31.910 --> 01:12:31.920 align:start position:0%
read to us
 
01:12:35.090 --> 01:12:35.100 align:start position:0%
um that in itself indicates that this
 
01:12:37.490 --> 01:12:37.500 align:start position:0%
committee the Judiciary Committee might
 
01:12:40.430 --> 01:12:40.440 align:start position:0%
be the appropriate source for
 
01:12:43.970 --> 01:12:43.980 align:start position:0%
legislation either in this bill or in
 
01:12:47.870 --> 01:12:47.880 align:start position:0%
another bill that would address issues
 
01:12:50.689 --> 01:12:50.699 align:start position:0%
that have come before us concerning the
 
01:12:54.110 --> 01:12:54.120 align:start position:0%
ability of the consumer
 
01:12:58.430 --> 01:12:58.440 align:start position:0%
division of the AG's office to meet the
 
01:13:00.890 --> 01:13:00.900 align:start position:0%
needs of the state in the most effective
 
01:13:03.950 --> 01:13:03.960 align:start position:0%
way and it's one more indication of the
 
01:13:06.890 --> 01:13:06.900 align:start position:0%
benefits of retaining and
 
01:13:10.610 --> 01:13:10.620 align:start position:0%
um I I do want to make one other comment
 
01:13:10.620 --> 01:13:12.050 align:start position:0%
um I I do want to make one other comment
about

01:13:12.050 --> 01:13:12.060 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:13:12.060 --> 01:13:12.790 align:start position:0%
about
um

01:13:12.790 --> 01:13:12.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:13:16.430 --> 01:13:16.440 align:start position:0%
representative caltex comments
 
01:13:19.130 --> 01:13:19.140 align:start position:0%
um and perhaps it comes from having been
 
01:13:21.290 --> 01:13:21.300 align:start position:0%
married to an attorney for almost 50
 
01:13:21.300 --> 01:13:23.090 align:start position:0%
married to an attorney for almost 50
years

01:13:23.090 --> 01:13:23.100 align:start position:0%
years
 
01:13:27.169 --> 01:13:27.179 align:start position:0%
um but there certainly are attorneys who
 
01:13:30.950 --> 01:13:30.960 align:start position:0%
behave inappropriately just as there are
 
01:13:33.709 --> 01:13:33.719 align:start position:0%
Physicians who behave inappropriately
 
01:13:36.410 --> 01:13:36.420 align:start position:0%
and I would hope that this committee
 
01:13:41.149 --> 01:13:41.159 align:start position:0%
would not begin by assuming that
 
01:13:41.159 --> 01:13:42.050 align:start position:0%
would not begin by assuming that
um

01:13:42.050 --> 01:13:42.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:13:45.950 --> 01:13:45.960 align:start position:0%
attorneys would just be in it that all
 
01:13:48.590 --> 01:13:48.600 align:start position:0%
attorneys would just be in this for the
 
01:13:50.570 --> 01:13:50.580 align:start position:0%
money and
 
01:13:50.580 --> 01:13:51.649 align:start position:0%
money and
um

01:13:51.649 --> 01:13:51.659 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:13:54.169 --> 01:13:54.179 align:start position:0%
I want to make sure that we help keep
 
01:13:56.510 --> 01:13:56.520 align:start position:0%
everybody honest thank you
 
01:14:00.590 --> 01:14:00.600 align:start position:0%
right so uh representative Qatar
 
01:14:02.870 --> 01:14:02.880 align:start position:0%
I appreciate your your comments rep
 
01:14:05.149 --> 01:14:05.159 align:start position:0%
Smith and I just I wanted to clarify I
 
01:14:07.810 --> 01:14:07.820 align:start position:0%
wasn't meeting any insult towards any
 
01:14:10.490 --> 01:14:10.500 align:start position:0%
attorneys and I apologize if it did come
 
01:14:12.050 --> 01:14:12.060 align:start position:0%
across that way we have several
 
01:14:15.050 --> 01:14:15.060 align:start position:0%
attorneys on our committee here that I
 
01:14:17.630 --> 01:14:17.640 align:start position:0%
am very fond of um and I would not mean
 
01:14:20.030 --> 01:14:20.040 align:start position:0%
to insult them I just I simply meant
 
01:14:22.370 --> 01:14:22.380 align:start position:0%
that in the purpose of of some of the
 
01:14:24.350 --> 01:14:24.360 align:start position:0%
class action lawsuits that have that
 
01:14:25.970 --> 01:14:25.980 align:start position:0%
have come out
 
01:14:28.370 --> 01:14:28.380 align:start position:0%
um but but no I certainly don't think
 
01:14:30.590 --> 01:14:30.600 align:start position:0%
that the majority of attorneys are are
 
01:14:32.270 --> 01:14:32.280 align:start position:0%
that way so I just wanted to clarify
 
01:14:33.590 --> 01:14:33.600 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:14:36.050 --> 01:14:36.060 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
01:14:40.550 --> 01:14:40.560 align:start position:0%
yeah but I think well I think I'm I'm
 
01:14:42.470 --> 01:14:42.480 align:start position:0%
going to speak and then I'll let you uh
 
01:14:45.229 --> 01:14:45.239 align:start position:0%
so I guess I would say
 
01:14:47.450 --> 01:14:47.460 align:start position:0%
from the comments I've heard I I have to
 
01:14:49.430 --> 01:14:49.440 align:start position:0%
say honestly I'm I'm disappointed
 
01:14:52.310 --> 01:14:52.320 align:start position:0%
because I share representative kutab's
 
01:14:54.410 --> 01:14:54.420 align:start position:0%
view I would vote I'm going to vote
 
01:14:57.890 --> 01:14:57.900 align:start position:0%
against the the motion to retain because
 
01:15:00.709 --> 01:15:00.719 align:start position:0%
I think the bill should be passed
 
01:15:02.990 --> 01:15:03.000 align:start position:0%
um as with with my proposed amendments
 
01:15:05.930 --> 01:15:05.940 align:start position:0%
and what I what I guess I'd ask you to
 
01:15:08.030 --> 01:15:08.040 align:start position:0%
to think about I mean maybe that I'm not
 
01:15:10.370 --> 01:15:10.380 align:start position:0%
going to change anybody's mind but
 
01:15:13.310 --> 01:15:13.320 align:start position:0%
this this bill particularly with the
 
01:15:15.530 --> 01:15:15.540 align:start position:0%
Amendments it now mirrors as I
 
01:15:18.350 --> 01:15:18.360 align:start position:0%
understand it the Connecticut bill which
 
01:15:21.169 --> 01:15:21.179 align:start position:0%
in turn mirrors the Virginia and
 
01:15:24.530 --> 01:15:24.540 align:start position:0%
Colorado Bill almost almost uh almost
 
01:15:26.570 --> 01:15:26.580 align:start position:0%
word for word I mean their their systems
 
01:15:28.669 --> 01:15:28.679 align:start position:0%
of of organizing statutes may be
 
01:15:30.709 --> 01:15:30.719 align:start position:0%
different but but basically it's it's
 
01:15:32.090 --> 01:15:32.100 align:start position:0%
the same
 
01:15:33.770 --> 01:15:33.780 align:start position:0%
and so what it
 
01:15:35.450 --> 01:15:35.460 align:start position:0%
what this says to me is a couple of
 
01:15:37.490 --> 01:15:37.500 align:start position:0%
things first of all I completely agree
 
01:15:39.530 --> 01:15:39.540 align:start position:0%
that this is a complicated bill it's got
 
01:15:42.850 --> 01:15:42.860 align:start position:0%
lots of sections and you know if you're
 
01:15:45.290 --> 01:15:45.300 align:start position:0%
if you're reading it you have to kind of
 
01:15:47.570 --> 01:15:47.580 align:start position:0%
keep going back well what okay so does
 
01:15:49.669 --> 01:15:49.679 align:start position:0%
this imply or not because maybe maybe it
 
01:15:51.169 --> 01:15:51.179 align:start position:0%
comes within this exception or something
 
01:15:53.570 --> 01:15:53.580 align:start position:0%
like that it is complicated I don't deny
 
01:15:56.570 --> 01:15:56.580 align:start position:0%
that but what I would say and I ask you
 
01:15:58.010 --> 01:15:58.020 align:start position:0%
to think about is
 
01:16:00.830 --> 01:16:00.840 align:start position:0%
this as we heard at as we saw at the
 
01:16:03.410 --> 01:16:03.420 align:start position:0%
hearing this bill has been worked on and
 
01:16:03.420 --> 01:16:04.490 align:start position:0%
hearing this bill has been worked on and
and

01:16:04.490 --> 01:16:04.500 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:16:07.250 --> 01:16:07.260 align:start position:0%
um considered and adopted
 
01:16:10.790 --> 01:16:10.800 align:start position:0%
uh by by some people who seem to me to
 
01:16:12.229 --> 01:16:12.239 align:start position:0%
be pretty smart and pretty pretty
 
01:16:14.750 --> 01:16:14.760 align:start position:0%
knowledgeable in this area and and I
 
01:16:17.209 --> 01:16:17.219 align:start position:0%
think did a pretty thorough job of
 
01:16:19.669 --> 01:16:19.679 align:start position:0%
putting this together and it's also been
 
01:16:22.070 --> 01:16:22.080 align:start position:0%
considered by a number of other
 
01:16:23.930 --> 01:16:23.940 align:start position:0%
legislative bodies and I guess I can't
 
01:16:25.790 --> 01:16:25.800 align:start position:0%
help noting it seemed it seems like
 
01:16:28.189 --> 01:16:28.199 align:start position:0%
legislative bodies that are on both
 
01:16:30.410 --> 01:16:30.420 align:start position:0%
sides of the spectrum of Connecticut on
 
01:16:32.570 --> 01:16:32.580 align:start position:0%
the one hand and I as I understand it
 
01:16:37.250 --> 01:16:37.260 align:start position:0%
Montana and uh Indiana have uh as I if I
 
01:16:38.990 --> 01:16:39.000 align:start position:0%
I think I've got this corrected Montana
 
01:16:41.390 --> 01:16:41.400 align:start position:0%
and Montana and I think it's Indiana the
 
01:16:43.130 --> 01:16:43.140 align:start position:0%
bills have gone through the legislature
 
01:16:45.169 --> 01:16:45.179 align:start position:0%
both houses and are waiting for the
 
01:16:46.850 --> 01:16:46.860 align:start position:0%
Governor's signature as I understand it
 
01:16:49.370 --> 01:16:49.380 align:start position:0%
so and plus you have Virginia it's
 
01:16:51.169 --> 01:16:51.179 align:start position:0%
passed in Virginia which I guess is now
 
01:16:53.630 --> 01:16:53.640 align:start position:0%
I think is is in Republican hands or at
 
01:16:55.189 --> 01:16:55.199 align:start position:0%
least the governor in one house is in
 
01:16:57.470 --> 01:16:57.480 align:start position:0%
Republican hands so anyway that suggests
 
01:16:59.689 --> 01:16:59.699 align:start position:0%
to me that this is sort of this has sort
 
01:17:01.250 --> 01:17:01.260 align:start position:0%
of been reviewed
 
01:17:04.610 --> 01:17:04.620 align:start position:0%
pretty extensively by people with
 
01:17:08.450 --> 01:17:08.460 align:start position:0%
differing philosophies and have been has
 
01:17:11.149 --> 01:17:11.159 align:start position:0%
been found to be an appropriate
 
01:17:13.729 --> 01:17:13.739 align:start position:0%
um appropriate legislation the other
 
01:17:15.410 --> 01:17:15.420 align:start position:0%
thing that I guess I would I would say
 
01:17:17.510 --> 01:17:17.520 align:start position:0%
is is this I think
 
01:17:20.209 --> 01:17:20.219 align:start position:0%
that you um
 
01:17:21.950 --> 01:17:21.960 align:start position:0%
one of the things that we should
 
01:17:24.470 --> 01:17:24.480 align:start position:0%
consider is that even if this bill is
 
01:17:28.850 --> 01:17:28.860 align:start position:0%
not perfect it does advance the ball it
 
01:17:30.590 --> 01:17:30.600 align:start position:0%
seems to me in the right direction in
 
01:17:32.870 --> 01:17:32.880 align:start position:0%
that it you know right now
 
01:17:35.510 --> 01:17:35.520 align:start position:0%
the protections that are
 
01:17:39.470 --> 01:17:39.480 align:start position:0%
provided to consumers in this bill don't
 
01:17:43.669 --> 01:17:43.679 align:start position:0%
exist so if we if we do if we do nothing
 
01:17:46.430 --> 01:17:46.440 align:start position:0%
the the law stays the same and there is
 
01:17:49.130 --> 01:17:49.140 align:start position:0%
less privacy protection than there would
 
01:17:51.770 --> 01:17:51.780 align:start position:0%
be with this bill
 
01:17:51.780 --> 01:17:52.370 align:start position:0%
be with this bill
um

01:17:52.370 --> 01:17:52.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:17:55.310 --> 01:17:55.320 align:start position:0%
with regard to the to the issue I you
 
01:17:57.470 --> 01:17:57.480 align:start position:0%
know I think representative my my
 
01:17:59.330 --> 01:17:59.340 align:start position:0%
understanding is that this bill would be
 
01:18:01.250 --> 01:18:01.260 align:start position:0%
pretty narrow because I think
 
01:18:05.390 --> 01:18:05.400 align:start position:0%
I think it does it does uh it does mean
 
01:18:07.550 --> 01:18:07.560 align:start position:0%
at least with with the amendment that
 
01:18:09.229 --> 01:18:09.239 align:start position:0%
I've proposed it does mean that this
 
01:18:12.590 --> 01:18:12.600 align:start position:0%
bill applies to New Hampshire business
 
01:18:14.870 --> 01:18:14.880 align:start position:0%
it applies to a business
 
01:18:17.290 --> 01:18:17.300 align:start position:0%
that in the prior year
 
01:18:20.330 --> 01:18:20.340 align:start position:0%
processed a hundred thousand consumers
 
01:18:23.030 --> 01:18:23.040 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire consumers so that you know
 
01:18:25.790 --> 01:18:25.800 align:start position:0%
that may make it relatively relatively
 
01:18:25.800 --> 01:18:27.050 align:start position:0%
that may make it relatively relatively
narrow

01:18:27.050 --> 01:18:27.060 align:start position:0%
narrow
 
01:18:29.630 --> 01:18:29.640 align:start position:0%
um which means that you know which which
 
01:18:32.870 --> 01:18:32.880 align:start position:0%
means I guess that to the extent
 
01:18:35.149 --> 01:18:35.159 align:start position:0%
that I and I was one of these that had
 
01:18:38.030 --> 01:18:38.040 align:start position:0%
concerns about you know is this is this
 
01:18:41.090 --> 01:18:41.100 align:start position:0%
somehow an effort by big business to to
 
01:18:43.070 --> 01:18:43.080 align:start position:0%
cap to do something that they can afford
 
01:18:45.169 --> 01:18:45.179 align:start position:0%
to do but will be will really hurt small
 
01:18:45.179 --> 01:18:46.490 align:start position:0%
to do but will be will really hurt small
business

01:18:46.490 --> 01:18:46.500 align:start position:0%
business
 
01:18:49.370 --> 01:18:49.380 align:start position:0%
um I think that that the fact that it is
 
01:18:51.950 --> 01:18:51.960 align:start position:0%
pretty narrow tends to suggest that you
 
01:18:55.729 --> 01:18:55.739 align:start position:0%
know there will be a lot of small and
 
01:18:57.729 --> 01:18:57.739 align:start position:0%
medium-sized businesses in New Hampshire
 
01:19:00.410 --> 01:19:00.420 align:start position:0%
that will not be covered by this and so
 
01:19:02.810 --> 01:19:02.820 align:start position:0%
that to me that sort of diminishes the
 
01:19:05.810 --> 01:19:05.820 align:start position:0%
argument that this is really an effort
 
01:19:07.370 --> 01:19:07.380 align:start position:0%
by big business to do something that
 
01:19:09.649 --> 01:19:09.659 align:start position:0%
will excuse my language will sort of
 
01:19:12.050 --> 01:19:12.060 align:start position:0%
screw smaller smaller mid-sized business
 
01:19:15.050 --> 01:19:15.060 align:start position:0%
it seems to me that that that
 
01:19:15.060 --> 01:19:16.189 align:start position:0%
it seems to me that that that
um

01:19:16.189 --> 01:19:16.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:19:17.649 --> 01:19:17.659 align:start position:0%
the the the
 
01:19:20.209 --> 01:19:20.219 align:start position:0%
applicability section sort of reduces
 
01:19:21.950 --> 01:19:21.960 align:start position:0%
that chance
 
01:19:21.960 --> 01:19:22.550 align:start position:0%
that chance
um

01:19:22.550 --> 01:19:22.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:19:24.770 --> 01:19:24.780 align:start position:0%
I know that there was a there was an
 
01:19:27.229 --> 01:19:27.239 align:start position:0%
issue raised as to
 
01:19:30.110 --> 01:19:30.120 align:start position:0%
um and the original bill that the the
 
01:19:33.050 --> 01:19:33.060 align:start position:0%
Attorney General was required to give an
 
01:19:35.750 --> 01:19:35.760 align:start position:0%
opera an option to cure for any
 
01:19:38.090 --> 01:19:38.100 align:start position:0%
violation without limitation and that
 
01:19:39.530 --> 01:19:39.540 align:start position:0%
was there was a question I think some
 
01:19:41.030 --> 01:19:41.040 align:start position:0%
people had a question about whether that
 
01:19:43.130 --> 01:19:43.140 align:start position:0%
you know whether that was fair should
 
01:19:46.189 --> 01:19:46.199 align:start position:0%
that be be allowed to happen and so I
 
01:19:48.050 --> 01:19:48.060 align:start position:0%
the amendment that I would propose
 
01:19:50.830 --> 01:19:50.840 align:start position:0%
change that to say that the requirement
 
01:19:53.870 --> 01:19:53.880 align:start position:0%
of gr of granting an option to cure as a
 
01:19:55.370 --> 01:19:55.380 align:start position:0%
you know that you had to do that only
 
01:19:58.189 --> 01:19:58.199 align:start position:0%
applied to the first year so that this
 
01:20:00.950 --> 01:20:00.960 align:start position:0%
this would you know if if this took
 
01:20:03.649 --> 01:20:03.659 align:start position:0%
effect as it was as it is proposed on
 
01:20:07.910 --> 01:20:07.920 align:start position:0%
January 1st of 2025 for that year
 
01:20:11.030 --> 01:20:11.040 align:start position:0%
the year 2025 the Attorney General would
 
01:20:14.030 --> 01:20:14.040 align:start position:0%
have to give an option to cure but after
 
01:20:16.010 --> 01:20:16.020 align:start position:0%
that it would be it would be
 
01:20:17.510 --> 01:20:17.520 align:start position:0%
discretionary so the Attorney General
 
01:20:18.669 --> 01:20:18.679 align:start position:0%
could decide
 
01:20:20.930 --> 01:20:20.940 align:start position:0%
using the factors that are listed in the
 
01:20:22.729 --> 01:20:22.739 align:start position:0%
bill whether or not it was appropriate
 
01:20:26.450 --> 01:20:26.460 align:start position:0%
to offer an opportunity uh to cure
 
01:20:26.460 --> 01:20:27.050 align:start position:0%
to offer an opportunity uh to cure
um

01:20:27.050 --> 01:20:27.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:29.030 --> 01:20:29.040 align:start position:0%
and then with the lastly with regards
 
01:20:30.410 --> 01:20:30.420 align:start position:0%
and I know this has been an issue with
 
01:20:32.209 --> 01:20:32.219 align:start position:0%
regard to the issue of a private cause
 
01:20:33.229 --> 01:20:33.239 align:start position:0%
of action
 
01:20:35.030 --> 01:20:35.040 align:start position:0%
I have to say that that is something
 
01:20:37.310 --> 01:20:37.320 align:start position:0%
that I feel very strongly about and I
 
01:20:38.990 --> 01:20:39.000 align:start position:0%
would I would not be able to support
 
01:20:42.229 --> 01:20:42.239 align:start position:0%
this bill if it had if it included a
 
01:20:44.270 --> 01:20:44.280 align:start position:0%
private cause of action because
 
01:20:44.280 --> 01:20:46.490 align:start position:0%
private cause of action because
particularly

01:20:46.490 --> 01:20:46.500 align:start position:0%
particularly
 
01:20:49.970 --> 01:20:49.980 align:start position:0%
in this area it seems to me that that
 
01:20:51.649 --> 01:20:51.659 align:start position:0%
the the
 
01:20:53.990 --> 01:20:54.000 align:start position:0%
that the violation if there's a
 
01:20:56.510 --> 01:20:56.520 align:start position:0%
violation of this statute if this
 
01:20:57.950 --> 01:20:57.960 align:start position:0%
statute were enacted and there were a
 
01:21:00.470 --> 01:21:00.480 align:start position:0%
violation of this statute my sense is
 
01:21:03.590 --> 01:21:03.600 align:start position:0%
that in the overwhelming majority of
 
01:21:07.370 --> 01:21:07.380 align:start position:0%
cases there would be little or no damage
 
01:21:09.350 --> 01:21:09.360 align:start position:0%
and if there was a private cause of
 
01:21:10.729 --> 01:21:10.739 align:start position:0%
action the only thing that somebody
 
01:21:13.189 --> 01:21:13.199 align:start position:0%
would be trying would really be trying
 
01:21:15.709 --> 01:21:15.719 align:start position:0%
to get is the thousand dollars that uh
 
01:21:18.169 --> 01:21:18.179 align:start position:0%
that is the the sort of penalty for lack
 
01:21:19.669 --> 01:21:19.679 align:start position:0%
of a better term that you're entitled to
 
01:21:21.470 --> 01:21:21.480 align:start position:0%
under the consumer protection act even
 
01:21:23.750 --> 01:21:23.760 align:start position:0%
if you don't have any real damages that
 
01:21:26.750 --> 01:21:26.760 align:start position:0%
those would be the types of of cases
 
01:21:30.229 --> 01:21:30.239 align:start position:0%
that would be predominantly
 
01:21:32.990 --> 01:21:33.000 align:start position:0%
um the the uh what would be what would
 
01:21:34.970 --> 01:21:34.980 align:start position:0%
be sought and so that people would not
 
01:21:37.130 --> 01:21:37.140 align:start position:0%
uh and and I think that there would
 
01:21:39.169 --> 01:21:39.179 align:start position:0%
there could be an incentive as I've I've
 
01:21:41.630 --> 01:21:41.640 align:start position:0%
done some arbitration since I retired
 
01:21:43.910 --> 01:21:43.920 align:start position:0%
and I'd sort of seen that this kind of
 
01:21:45.350 --> 01:21:45.360 align:start position:0%
thing happens there would be class
 
01:21:48.890 --> 01:21:48.900 align:start position:0%
actions for Leo with you know people
 
01:21:51.169 --> 01:21:51.179 align:start position:0%
that suffered really little damages but
 
01:21:52.490 --> 01:21:52.500 align:start position:0%
there were a lot of them and so there
 
01:21:55.550 --> 01:21:55.560 align:start position:0%
were you know in the end what what often
 
01:21:58.910 --> 01:21:58.920 align:start position:0%
happens in those cases is you know uh
 
01:22:01.729 --> 01:22:01.739 align:start position:0%
the the quote-unquote victims end up
 
01:22:05.750 --> 01:22:05.760 align:start position:0%
recovering fifteen dollars and uh the
 
01:22:07.910 --> 01:22:07.920 align:start position:0%
attorneys recover hundreds of thousands
 
01:22:10.669 --> 01:22:10.679 align:start position:0%
of dollars in legal fees uh and that
 
01:22:12.709 --> 01:22:12.719 align:start position:0%
just doesn't seem to me to be a product
 
01:22:16.430 --> 01:22:16.440 align:start position:0%
active uh situation
 
01:22:19.070 --> 01:22:19.080 align:start position:0%
I would agree however that there could
 
01:22:21.290 --> 01:22:21.300 align:start position:0%
be there could be a few cases in which
 
01:22:23.689 --> 01:22:23.699 align:start position:0%
people were armed very seriously by
 
01:22:26.209 --> 01:22:26.219 align:start position:0%
something that violated the statute but
 
01:22:28.550 --> 01:22:28.560 align:start position:0%
the thing I would you know I would I
 
01:22:31.250 --> 01:22:31.260 align:start position:0%
would ask you to consider is
 
01:22:34.610 --> 01:22:34.620 align:start position:0%
that those people are not left without a
 
01:22:36.950 --> 01:22:36.960 align:start position:0%
remedy because the Attorney General is
 
01:22:39.350 --> 01:22:39.360 align:start position:0%
allowed to bring actions and I would
 
01:22:40.970 --> 01:22:40.980 align:start position:0%
seem to me that that kind of case where
 
01:22:42.709 --> 01:22:42.719 align:start position:0%
somebody was really armed very
 
01:22:45.050 --> 01:22:45.060 align:start position:0%
significantly their reputation was
 
01:22:47.570 --> 01:22:47.580 align:start position:0%
publicly ruined or something something
 
01:22:49.189 --> 01:22:49.199 align:start position:0%
else you know happened even more
 
01:22:50.990 --> 01:22:51.000 align:start position:0%
egregious than that perhaps physical
 
01:22:53.330 --> 01:22:53.340 align:start position:0%
harm to somebody or whatever
 
01:22:53.340 --> 01:22:54.050 align:start position:0%
harm to somebody or whatever
um

01:22:54.050 --> 01:22:54.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:22:55.550 --> 01:22:55.560 align:start position:0%
that would be the kind of situation
 
01:22:57.530 --> 01:22:57.540 align:start position:0%
where the Attorney General would be
 
01:23:00.410 --> 01:23:00.420 align:start position:0%
likely to exercise his his authority to
 
01:23:02.750 --> 01:23:02.760 align:start position:0%
bring an action and and could could
 
01:23:05.990 --> 01:23:06.000 align:start position:0%
recover damages which could then be uh
 
01:23:08.149 --> 01:23:08.159 align:start position:0%
available to the person so I I don't
 
01:23:09.709 --> 01:23:09.719 align:start position:0%
think it's it's fair to say that
 
01:23:12.110 --> 01:23:12.120 align:start position:0%
somebody would be left people that are
 
01:23:14.570 --> 01:23:14.580 align:start position:0%
injured would be left remedy-less unless
 
01:23:16.850 --> 01:23:16.860 align:start position:0%
there was a private cause of action
 
01:23:19.010 --> 01:23:19.020 align:start position:0%
so I guess I'm not gonna I don't want to
 
01:23:20.990 --> 01:23:21.000 align:start position:0%
go on forever and I know I've probably
 
01:23:23.209 --> 01:23:23.219 align:start position:0%
spoken too long already I hope you'll
 
01:23:27.050 --> 01:23:27.060 align:start position:0%
think about the the points I've made
 
01:23:30.830 --> 01:23:30.840 align:start position:0%
um and I I would encourage you to vote
 
01:23:32.930 --> 01:23:32.940 align:start position:0%
against the motion to retain so that
 
01:23:34.610 --> 01:23:34.620 align:start position:0%
another motion could be made and that
 
01:23:37.370 --> 01:23:37.380 align:start position:0%
mode my motion would be to ought to pass
 
01:23:38.990 --> 01:23:39.000 align:start position:0%
with the Amendments that that I've
 
01:23:41.870 --> 01:23:41.880 align:start position:0%
proposed and if you know I that's that's
 
01:23:44.209 --> 01:23:44.219 align:start position:0%
my pitch I I understand it may be a
 
01:23:45.770 --> 01:23:45.780 align:start position:0%
losing cause and if I lose and I will
 
01:23:47.810 --> 01:23:47.820 align:start position:0%
happily participate in the retent in the
 
01:23:49.490 --> 01:23:49.500 align:start position:0%
in working on the bill further during
 
01:23:51.950 --> 01:23:51.960 align:start position:0%
the retain period but I think it would
 
01:23:54.169 --> 01:23:54.179 align:start position:0%
be better to pass it now and so I hope
 
01:23:55.750 --> 01:23:55.760 align:start position:0%
you'll I hope you'll think about that
 
01:23:58.189 --> 01:23:58.199 align:start position:0%
representative Horgan well thank you for
 
01:24:00.290 --> 01:24:00.300 align:start position:0%
thanks for letting me thank you for
 
01:24:03.350 --> 01:24:03.360 align:start position:0%
letting me speak um the clerk reminded
 
01:24:05.330 --> 01:24:05.340 align:start position:0%
me that there's actually a class action
 
01:24:07.189 --> 01:24:07.199 align:start position:0%
suit going around something with people
 
01:24:09.169 --> 01:24:09.179 align:start position:0%
or Facebook messages I've been a
 
01:24:11.330 --> 01:24:11.340 align:start position:0%
beneficiary of several of those over the
 
01:24:13.610 --> 01:24:13.620 align:start position:0%
year and actually the 15 check is
 
01:24:15.649 --> 01:24:15.659 align:start position:0%
about 10 times bigger than what you
 
01:24:18.290 --> 01:24:18.300 align:start position:0%
usually get out of these things and I
 
01:24:19.610 --> 01:24:19.620 align:start position:0%
think one of them actually was in my
 
01:24:21.350 --> 01:24:21.360 align:start position:0%
role as a web service provider that I
 
01:24:23.630 --> 01:24:23.640 align:start position:0%
was leasing out a few inches of space on
 
01:24:26.510 --> 01:24:26.520 align:start position:0%
my website to Google to use for their ad
 
01:24:28.250 --> 01:24:28.260 align:start position:0%
services and there's some sort of class
 
01:24:30.050 --> 01:24:30.060 align:start position:0%
action suit involved with that and I got
 
01:24:32.450 --> 01:24:32.460 align:start position:0%
and even then it was less than fifteen
 
01:24:34.669 --> 01:24:34.679 align:start position:0%
dollars and it was so a little money I
 
01:24:36.890 --> 01:24:36.900 align:start position:0%
forgotten what it is but um
 
01:24:38.990 --> 01:24:39.000 align:start position:0%
mostly just want to say is the the
 
01:24:41.570 --> 01:24:41.580 align:start position:0%
online industry the providers they're
 
01:24:44.030 --> 01:24:44.040 align:start position:0%
well aware of the consumers concerns
 
01:24:46.010 --> 01:24:46.020 align:start position:0%
these people aren't aren't Saints but
 
01:24:47.990 --> 01:24:48.000 align:start position:0%
they do know that people are worried
 
01:24:49.370 --> 01:24:49.380 align:start position:0%
about them and they're of course worried
 
01:24:49.380 --> 01:24:50.030 align:start position:0%
about them and they're of course worried
about

01:24:50.030 --> 01:24:50.040 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:24:51.830 --> 01:24:51.840 align:start position:0%
themselves being the target of like
 
01:24:54.470 --> 01:24:54.480 align:start position:0%
illegal activity and abuse so I think uh
 
01:24:57.470 --> 01:24:57.480 align:start position:0%
at least to some extent the market and
 
01:24:58.910 --> 01:24:58.920 align:start position:0%
there will be need to be more guidance
 
01:25:01.130 --> 01:25:01.140 align:start position:0%
from the law but I think the market uh
 
01:25:03.590 --> 01:25:03.600 align:start position:0%
does regulate itself to a certain extent
 
01:25:05.930 --> 01:25:05.940 align:start position:0%
and also uh
 
01:25:08.750 --> 01:25:08.760 align:start position:0%
what was I going to say oh and um
 
01:25:11.149 --> 01:25:11.159 align:start position:0%
also they're I think they're all pretty
 
01:25:14.510 --> 01:25:14.520 align:start position:0%
well aware of how fragile they're they
 
01:25:16.310 --> 01:25:16.320 align:start position:0%
there's always a few providers you've
 
01:25:17.630 --> 01:25:17.640 align:start position:0%
seen the monopolies but I think they're
 
01:25:19.729 --> 01:25:19.739 align:start position:0%
all aware and some of them do hang on
 
01:25:21.709 --> 01:25:21.719 align:start position:0%
for year after year like Microsoft came
 
01:25:23.570 --> 01:25:23.580 align:start position:0%
to visit us and apple but for the most
 
01:25:23.580 --> 01:25:24.950 align:start position:0%
to visit us and apple but for the most
part

01:25:24.950 --> 01:25:24.960 align:start position:0%
part
 
01:25:27.890 --> 01:25:27.900 align:start position:0%
um most part these entities come and go
 
01:25:29.090 --> 01:25:29.100 align:start position:0%
every year is and the people who
 
01:25:31.070 --> 01:25:31.080 align:start position:0%
operated them were hopefully well aware
 
01:25:34.130 --> 01:25:34.140 align:start position:0%
of how that they're 10 10 years fragile
 
01:25:35.450 --> 01:25:35.460 align:start position:0%
and one of the things that often does
 
01:25:36.649 --> 01:25:36.659 align:start position:0%
them in is
 
01:25:38.390 --> 01:25:38.400 align:start position:0%
either privacy or accountability
 
01:25:41.090 --> 01:25:41.100 align:start position:0%
concerns as we've seen with uh
 
01:25:42.590 --> 01:25:42.600 align:start position:0%
will actually use Facebook to
 
01:25:43.790 --> 01:25:43.800 align:start position:0%
communicate with a member of this
 
01:25:46.070 --> 01:25:46.080 align:start position:0%
Committee just this morning but um you
 
01:25:48.470 --> 01:25:48.480 align:start position:0%
know Facebook has taken a big hit in the
 
01:25:50.510 --> 01:25:50.520 align:start position:0%
last few months or years and Twitter is
 
01:25:53.090 --> 01:25:53.100 align:start position:0%
also uh it's not quite blowing up as
 
01:25:55.189 --> 01:25:55.199 align:start position:0%
spectacularly as their owner's SpaceX
 
01:25:57.530 --> 01:25:57.540 align:start position:0%
rocket but that too is blown up because
 
01:25:59.149 --> 01:25:59.159 align:start position:0%
the number of probably bad decisions
 
01:26:01.070 --> 01:26:01.080 align:start position:0%
that have been made so they're all I
 
01:26:03.110 --> 01:26:03.120 align:start position:0%
think these you know they
 
01:26:04.669 --> 01:26:04.679 align:start position:0%
the large and small entrepreneurs in
 
01:26:07.669 --> 01:26:07.679 align:start position:0%
that space are what right did I say
 
01:26:09.410 --> 01:26:09.420 align:start position:0%
something wrong then no no it's just
 
01:26:11.629 --> 01:26:11.639 align:start position:0%
it's going to be going a little bit a
 
01:26:13.490 --> 01:26:13.500 align:start position:0%
little bit away anyway anyway I think so
 
01:26:15.709 --> 01:26:15.719 align:start position:0%
they're well aware that this is a uh
 
01:26:17.930 --> 01:26:17.940 align:start position:0%
that they need they're well aware that
 
01:26:19.490 --> 01:26:19.500 align:start position:0%
they need us consumers and they're
 
01:26:21.169 --> 01:26:21.179 align:start position:0%
probably pretty well aware of what our
 
01:26:23.209 --> 01:26:23.219 align:start position:0%
concerns are so they will beat him at
 
01:26:25.129 --> 01:26:25.139 align:start position:0%
least part ways so I don't think it's
 
01:26:27.110 --> 01:26:27.120 align:start position:0%
and the urgency with this bill and I
 
01:26:28.729 --> 01:26:28.739 align:start position:0%
think certainly we're retaining it is an
 
01:26:31.370 --> 01:26:31.380 align:start position:0%
excellent idea I think thanks
 
01:26:33.590 --> 01:26:33.600 align:start position:0%
anyone else wish to yes representative
 
01:26:36.169 --> 01:26:36.179 align:start position:0%
Stapleton thank you Mr chair
 
01:26:36.179 --> 01:26:37.310 align:start position:0%
Stapleton thank you Mr chair
um

01:26:37.310 --> 01:26:37.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:26:40.370 --> 01:26:40.380 align:start position:0%
the Connecticut form was passed in the
 
01:26:44.350 --> 01:26:44.360 align:start position:0%
spring of 2022 so it's a fairly recent
 
01:26:44.360 --> 01:26:46.189 align:start position:0%
spring of 2022 so it's a fairly recent
law

01:26:46.189 --> 01:26:46.199 align:start position:0%
law
 
01:26:50.270 --> 01:26:50.280 align:start position:0%
and um I believe that
 
01:26:52.790 --> 01:26:52.800 align:start position:0%
you know if we delay this for six months
 
01:26:55.669 --> 01:26:55.679 align:start position:0%
to work on it we're not going to fall
 
01:26:59.510 --> 01:26:59.520 align:start position:0%
off the cliff with any really dangerous
 
01:27:02.629 --> 01:27:02.639 align:start position:0%
sort of occurrences but the six months
 
01:27:04.870 --> 01:27:04.880 align:start position:0%
gives us time to look into
 
01:27:07.550 --> 01:27:07.560 align:start position:0%
what's happened in Connecticut are there
 
01:27:10.189 --> 01:27:10.199 align:start position:0%
some pitfalls are there some nuances are
 
01:27:12.830 --> 01:27:12.840 align:start position:0%
there some revisions that they have come
 
01:27:15.410 --> 01:27:15.420 align:start position:0%
across in the limited time to look at it
 
01:27:19.850 --> 01:27:19.860 align:start position:0%
to to make a better product and to avoid
 
01:27:23.990 --> 01:27:24.000 align:start position:0%
things that we didn't comprehend and
 
01:27:26.570 --> 01:27:26.580 align:start position:0%
could maybe make make a better product
 
01:27:29.810 --> 01:27:29.820 align:start position:0%
by relying on the other State's
 
01:27:34.610 --> 01:27:34.620 align:start position:0%
experiences that have passed the law
 
01:27:37.669 --> 01:27:37.679 align:start position:0%
are there anyone else which do you speak
