00:00:01.429 --> 00:00:01.439 align:start position:0%
figure out a way to make this system
 
00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:04.560 align:start position:0%
work better so that's what you see in in
 
00:00:07.369 --> 00:00:07.379 align:start position:0%
the bill and what it does is IT
 
00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:09.960 align:start position:0%
addresses the issues that arose there
 
00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.049 align:start position:0%
addresses the issues that arose there
um

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 align:start position:0%
 
00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:13.610 align:start position:0%
 
which

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 align:start position:0%
which
 
00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 align:start position:0%
tried to get at the kind of process of
 
00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 align:start position:0%
transferring uh the wires and why it
 
00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 align:start position:0%
takes so long and you know we learned
 
00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 align:start position:0%
that it that uh one company can't move a
 
00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 align:start position:0%
wire until the company above it has
 
00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 align:start position:0%
moved its wire so you end up with this
 
00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 align:start position:0%
chain of responsibility and notification
 
00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 align:start position:0%
and work orders that go out we also
 
00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 align:start position:0%
learned that it was very hard for
 
00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 align:start position:0%
municipalities or others to enter to
 
00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 align:start position:0%
understand the data system or have
 
00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 align:start position:0%
access to the data system which can tell
 
00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 align:start position:0%
them where what the situation with any
 
00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:50.000 align:start position:0%
given poll is in there
 
00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 align:start position:0%
municipality and then
 
00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 align:start position:0%
um not everybody uses the so-called
 
00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 align:start position:0%
engine system some utility to do some
 
00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 align:start position:0%
don't and so would there be
 
00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:03.680 align:start position:0%
communication between
 
00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 align:start position:0%
the utilities who have different Data
 
00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 align:start position:0%
Systems so that's what the um
 
00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 align:start position:0%
that's what it's going to get at you'll
 
00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 align:start position:0%
see the responsibilities here
 
00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 align:start position:0%
um make the management systems work
 
00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 align:start position:0%
better EG engines see if we can get more
 
00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 align:start position:0%
people to use it and see if there's a
 
00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 align:start position:0%
way of providing access to
 
00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 align:start position:0%
municipalities so they can get real-time
 
00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 align:start position:0%
information on what's going on there
 
00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:26.570 align:start position:0%
information on what's going on there
um

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 align:start position:0%
also uh look at the poll identification
 
00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 align:start position:0%
and poll location information so that
 
00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 align:start position:0%
it's clear as to what is where and what
 
00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 align:start position:0%
needs to be
 
00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 align:start position:0%
done see if there needs to be any
 
00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:44.420 align:start position:0%
changes to the rules under the puc
 
00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 align:start position:0%
regarding poll transfers that might
 
00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 align:start position:0%
facilitate this process so the
 
00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 align:start position:0%
stakeholder group is set up by all the
 
00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 align:start position:0%
people who wanted to participate it'll
 
00:01:58.569 --> 00:01:58.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 align:start position:0%
a department of energy we heard from the
 
00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 align:start position:0%
person who runs the program the
 
00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:03.860 align:start position:0%
enforcement program
 
00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 align:start position:0%
there and so that that there it is I
 
00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 align:start position:0%
know that representative can provide you
 
00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 align:start position:0%
with a lot more background of the issues
 
00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 align:start position:0%
but this is the way we think we can get
 
00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 align:start position:0%
out the problems Mr chairman
 
00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 align:start position:0%
wonderful thank you senator for
 
00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:19.739 align:start position:0%
introducing this bill to us are there
 
00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.140 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington has a question
 
00:02:26.089 --> 00:02:26.099 align:start position:0%
more of a comment I'm looking at a
 
00:02:28.369 --> 00:02:28.379 align:start position:0%
picture here that thankfully uh Mr
 
00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:30.239 align:start position:0%
Licata is taking care of this for me but
 
00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 align:start position:0%
there's a hunk of pole we probably can't
 
00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 align:start position:0%
see it that's been hanging in the air
 
00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 align:start position:0%
for about four or five weeks now those
 
00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 align:start position:0%
are all telecommunications not electric
 
00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 align:start position:0%
cables on there but if anything
 
00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 align:start position:0%
reinforces the need for this bill just a
 
00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 align:start position:0%
pitch is worth a thousand words and I'll
 
00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 align:start position:0%
shut up
 
00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 align:start position:0%
I will say thank your question
 
00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington I won't
 
00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 align:start position:0%
comment on your willingness to be quiet
 
00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:54.239 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 align:start position:0%
um I will say that uh you know I hadn't
 
00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 align:start position:0%
really thought much about telephone
 
00:02:59.509 --> 00:02:59.519 align:start position:0%
poles right it was on his committee and
 
00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 align:start position:0%
then you know you start driving around
 
00:03:02.089 --> 00:03:02.099 align:start position:0%
your committee and it's like oh you're
 
00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 align:start position:0%
commuting oh yeah there there there and
 
00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 align:start position:0%
uh and we also heard from some private
 
00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:09.239 align:start position:0%
landowners some Farmers for whom this is
 
00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 align:start position:0%
creating a real problem in their land so
 
00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:14.580 align:start position:0%
it'd be good to get at it yeah thank you
 
00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman okay representative Doug
 
00:03:18.589 --> 00:03:18.599 align:start position:0%
Thomas has a question thank you Mr thank
 
00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question Center
 
00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700 align:start position:0%
welcome uh during the last summer when
 
00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200 align:start position:0%
they were having the committee meetings
 
00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 align:start position:0%
and so forth was there a sense of um how
 
00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:32.459 align:start position:0%
many uh objects around the state that
 
00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 align:start position:0%
are would be considered ones that were
 
00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 align:start position:0%
either abandoned or hadn't been taken
 
00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 align:start position:0%
down yet are we talking any numbers come
 
00:03:43.309 --> 00:03:43.319 align:start position:0%
up or just a general sense yeah I'm I'm
 
00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:44.640 align:start position:0%
sorry that I don't have to thank your
 
00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:45.780 align:start position:0%
question I'm sorry I don't have that top
 
00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000 align:start position:0%
of my head but I did the one thing that
 
00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.040 align:start position:0%
did stick in my mind was that when we
 
00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:52.140 align:start position:0%
had a storm in 2022
 
00:03:55.309 --> 00:03:55.319 align:start position:0%
from that one storm there were 800 poles
 
00:03:57.949 --> 00:03:57.959 align:start position:0%
that needed to needed to be replaced so
 
00:03:59.330 --> 00:03:59.340 align:start position:0%
whether it's just you know the normal
 
00:04:01.369 --> 00:04:01.379 align:start position:0%
aging or needing to put in a higher
 
00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:03.360 align:start position:0%
pulse or more wire
 
00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:06.000 align:start position:0%
um more transmission wires can be put on
 
00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:08.280 align:start position:0%
it or other other wires
 
00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:10.980 align:start position:0%
um uh there are hundreds and hundreds
 
00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:13.920 align:start position:0%
maybe I maybe representative Grody has a
 
00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:15.480 align:start position:0%
more figure but there's a lot of them
 
00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:16.500 align:start position:0%
out there
 
00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:21.299 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:23.100 align:start position:0%
okay additional questions from the
 
00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:24.960 align:start position:0%
committee representative Noel has a
 
00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:25.909 align:start position:0%
committee representative Noel has a
question

00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:25.919 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:27.840 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you senator
 
00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:30.300 align:start position:0%
for taking my question is there an in is
 
00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:32.460 align:start position:0%
there an informal understanding between
 
00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:34.460 align:start position:0%
the the companies that they can share
 
00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:37.680 align:start position:0%
polls with each other or is that a
 
00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:40.320 align:start position:0%
formalized procedure uh that's a
 
00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:41.580 align:start position:0%
question that's a formalized procedure
 
00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:43.740 align:start position:0%
and we're going to hear I believe from
 
00:04:46.189 --> 00:04:46.199 align:start position:0%
um folks the enforcement person at doe
 
00:04:48.469 --> 00:04:48.479 align:start position:0%
and uh potentially utilities I don't
 
00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:50.400 align:start position:0%
know who else is signed up for that but
 
00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:51.660 align:start position:0%
a lot of those questions can get
 
00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:56.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:58.370 --> 00:04:58.380 align:start position:0%
thank you representative McGee had a
 
00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:00.540 align:start position:0%
question yes thank you Mr chairman and
 
00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:01.740 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question thanks
 
00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:03.120 align:start position:0%
for being here
 
00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:05.160 align:start position:0%
um this may go to other folks on the
 
00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:06.960 align:start position:0%
committee but it sounds like this group
 
00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:08.880 align:start position:0%
is going to be looking at uh coming up
 
00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:10.440 align:start position:0%
with some decisions around what needs to
 
00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:12.540 align:start position:0%
be done in terms of addressing some of
 
00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:14.100 align:start position:0%
the lagging maintenance that hasn't gone
 
00:05:17.689 --> 00:05:17.699 align:start position:0%
on but will there also be an effort to
 
00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:20.460 align:start position:0%
address going forward being able to
 
00:05:22.129 --> 00:05:22.139 align:start position:0%
Chronicle what's going on because it
 
00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:23.880 align:start position:0%
sounds like we've maybe let things get a
 
00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:25.500 align:start position:0%
little out of hand to answer the
 
00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:27.120 align:start position:0%
question that's why there's so much here
 
00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:28.860 align:start position:0%
about engines and the data systems
 
00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:31.680 align:start position:0%
because you know the there there really
 
00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:34.860 align:start position:0%
were two issues better coordination
 
00:05:37.249 --> 00:05:37.259 align:start position:0%
so things can get happening be happening
 
00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:39.180 align:start position:0%
but then to do that
 
00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:42.780 align:start position:0%
better and more shared information and I
 
00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:44.580 align:start position:0%
particularly liked that information
 
00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:47.520 align:start position:0%
shared find some ways that municipality
 
00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:49.800 align:start position:0%
is going to access to the engine system
 
00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:51.960 align:start position:0%
and more people get access to it so that
 
00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:54.720 align:start position:0%
so they can know they can report they
 
00:05:57.350 --> 00:05:57.360 align:start position:0%
can understand and get back to people
 
00:05:58.969 --> 00:05:58.979 align:start position:0%
who in the community are complaining
 
00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:00.600 align:start position:0%
about it and say Here's the schedule
 
00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:02.100 align:start position:0%
here's going to happen and I have some
 
00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:03.840 align:start position:0%
accountability on the schedule as well
 
00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:05.580 align:start position:0%
and I think there's really a great
 
00:06:07.249 --> 00:06:07.259 align:start position:0%
willingness among all the people saying
 
00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:09.240 align:start position:0%
yeah we need to get together and have a
 
00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:10.860 align:start position:0%
group to make this happen and I think I
 
00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:13.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:16.020 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Bernardi has a
 
00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:17.390 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Bernardi has a
question

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:17.400 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:06:19.969 --> 00:06:19.979 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair uh
 
00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:24.060 align:start position:0%
uh Senator is there any uh um evaluation
 
00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:25.680 align:start position:0%
going to be done as to whether or not
 
00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:28.380 align:start position:0%
some of the lines should be buried or is
 
00:06:31.129 --> 00:06:31.139 align:start position:0%
this just going to focus on polls
 
00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:32.580 align:start position:0%
thanks for your question
 
00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:34.740 align:start position:0%
um this is just about the polls and you
 
00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:36.900 align:start position:0%
know the utilities
 
00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:38.580 align:start position:0%
you know I I think in terms of their
 
00:06:40.249 --> 00:06:40.259 align:start position:0%
whole transmission system that that's
 
00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:41.880 align:start position:0%
something they're empowered to look at
 
00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:43.860 align:start position:0%
all kinds of Alternatives but this is
 
00:06:46.969 --> 00:06:46.979 align:start position:0%
this is the polls thank you
 
00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:48.720 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas has another
 
00:06:50.689 --> 00:06:50.699 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair thank you
 
00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:53.280 align:start position:0%
for indulging me one more question
 
00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:55.800 align:start position:0%
um uh well I'll just feed off what I
 
00:06:57.710 --> 00:06:57.720 align:start position:0%
just heard from representative Bernardi
 
00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:00.060 align:start position:0%
if this is just about polls I hope it
 
00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:01.800 align:start position:0%
would be other extraneous things that
 
00:07:04.129 --> 00:07:04.139 align:start position:0%
might have been associated with me maybe
 
00:07:05.450 --> 00:07:05.460 align:start position:0%
they were one time hanging on them and
 
00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:07.860 align:start position:0%
now they're just drooping over uh I hope
 
00:07:10.189 --> 00:07:10.199 align:start position:0%
they would focus on something other than
 
00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:13.560 align:start position:0%
just polls when practical my question is
 
00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:14.450 align:start position:0%
just polls when practical my question is
um

00:07:14.450 --> 00:07:14.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:07:17.689 --> 00:07:17.699 align:start position:0%
is there a sense when we when this group
 
00:07:19.909 --> 00:07:19.919 align:start position:0%
gets together and comes to an agreement
 
00:07:21.589 --> 00:07:21.599 align:start position:0%
with how they're going to handle this is
 
00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:24.720 align:start position:0%
there a sense that this will all happen
 
00:07:30.589 --> 00:07:30.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:32.880 align:start position:0%
um thanks for your question you know I
 
00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:35.689 align:start position:0%
um thanks for your question you know I
uh

00:07:35.689 --> 00:07:35.699 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:38.510 --> 00:07:38.520 align:start position:0%
I mean the the the polls are replaced
 
00:07:40.790 --> 00:07:40.800 align:start position:0%
and the work is done already right it's
 
00:07:42.890 --> 00:07:42.900 align:start position:0%
just we're looking at the efficiency and
 
00:07:45.529 --> 00:07:45.539 align:start position:0%
the quickness of it so
 
00:07:47.749 --> 00:07:47.759 align:start position:0%
um you know their re transmission costs
 
00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:50.160 align:start position:0%
are recoverable charges
 
00:07:52.129 --> 00:07:52.139 align:start position:0%
and I mean at that this bill changes
 
00:07:54.650 --> 00:07:54.660 align:start position:0%
nothing about that
 
00:07:57.170 --> 00:07:57.180 align:start position:0%
and I don't expect to be any I'm I don't
 
00:07:58.610 --> 00:07:58.620 align:start position:0%
see any increase they might even Save
 
00:07:59.870 --> 00:07:59.880 align:start position:0%
Somebody because then get the work done
 
00:08:01.189 --> 00:08:01.199 align:start position:0%
more quickly
 
00:08:04.850 --> 00:08:04.860 align:start position:0%
yeah representative munz has a question
 
00:08:06.589 --> 00:08:06.599 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you senator
 
00:08:07.909 --> 00:08:07.919 align:start position:0%
for being here
 
00:08:09.950 --> 00:08:09.960 align:start position:0%
um I have just a question on the
 
00:08:12.290 --> 00:08:12.300 align:start position:0%
specific language in the bill line 14
 
00:08:15.230 --> 00:08:15.240 align:start position:0%
says that uh there will be two members
 
00:08:17.029 --> 00:08:17.039 align:start position:0%
from investor owned New Hampshire
 
00:08:19.909 --> 00:08:19.919 align:start position:0%
Electric utilities is that two members
 
00:08:22.490 --> 00:08:22.500 align:start position:0%
from each utility or two members in
 
00:08:25.430 --> 00:08:25.440 align:start position:0%
total representing the utilities
 
00:08:28.070 --> 00:08:28.080 align:start position:0%
I'm two total okay that's the way I read
 
00:08:31.309 --> 00:08:31.319 align:start position:0%
it okay and follow-up follow-up
 
00:08:33.829 --> 00:08:33.839 align:start position:0%
um do you have any sense at all
 
00:08:36.649 --> 00:08:36.659 align:start position:0%
um how many how large this stakeholder
 
00:08:39.050 --> 00:08:39.060 align:start position:0%
group would be based on
 
00:08:41.149 --> 00:08:41.159 align:start position:0%
the the people that are going to be
 
00:08:41.159 --> 00:08:43.490 align:start position:0%
the the people that are going to be
members

00:08:43.490 --> 00:08:43.500 align:start position:0%
members
 
00:08:49.250 --> 00:08:49.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:51.170 --> 00:08:51.180 align:start position:0%
that's okay I know I'm putting you on
 
00:08:52.430 --> 00:08:52.440 align:start position:0%
the spot
 
00:08:56.150 --> 00:08:56.160 align:start position:0%
I go looks like to me like we've got ten
 
00:08:58.190 --> 00:08:58.200 align:start position:0%
okay members all right now I just did
 
00:09:00.769 --> 00:09:00.779 align:start position:0%
the count okay thank you looks like we
 
00:09:02.269 --> 00:09:02.279 align:start position:0%
got 10.
 
00:09:03.769 --> 00:09:03.779 align:start position:0%
these are these are the people who
 
00:09:05.690 --> 00:09:05.700 align:start position:0%
wanted to be at the table
 
00:09:08.750 --> 00:09:08.760 align:start position:0%
representative Carmen has a question
 
00:09:10.310 --> 00:09:10.320 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
00:09:13.070 --> 00:09:13.080 align:start position:0%
Senator waters for taking my question uh
 
00:09:15.110 --> 00:09:15.120 align:start position:0%
can you fill me in a little bit more on
 
00:09:18.650 --> 00:09:18.660 align:start position:0%
what sort of centralized database there
 
00:09:20.750 --> 00:09:20.760 align:start position:0%
already is that the utilities are
 
00:09:22.970 --> 00:09:22.980 align:start position:0%
tapping off of or you know what what is
 
00:09:26.269 --> 00:09:26.279 align:start position:0%
there and what what further is needed
 
00:09:26.279 --> 00:09:28.790 align:start position:0%
there and what what further is needed
centrally

00:09:28.790 --> 00:09:28.800 align:start position:0%
centrally
 
00:09:31.190 --> 00:09:31.200 align:start position:0%
um well there is the the largest ones
 
00:09:33.230 --> 00:09:33.240 align:start position:0%
the so-called engine system you'll see
 
00:09:37.910 --> 00:09:37.920 align:start position:0%
it referenced in the in the bill and um
 
00:09:40.070 --> 00:09:40.080 align:start position:0%
you know or another centralized system
 
00:09:43.370 --> 00:09:43.380 align:start position:0%
information sharing so that not all the
 
00:09:45.829 --> 00:09:45.839 align:start position:0%
utilities use engines
 
00:09:47.570 --> 00:09:47.580 align:start position:0%
so there's more than one and there's
 
00:09:49.970 --> 00:09:49.980 align:start position:0%
some critiques about whether engines is
 
00:09:51.650 --> 00:09:51.660 align:start position:0%
the best or whether it needs to be
 
00:09:55.130 --> 00:09:55.140 align:start position:0%
improved and so on so that's why we kind
 
00:09:57.050 --> 00:09:57.060 align:start position:0%
of direct this
 
00:10:00.650 --> 00:10:00.660 align:start position:0%
um this group to look at that issue of
 
00:10:02.810 --> 00:10:02.820 align:start position:0%
what's the best what upgrades might
 
00:10:05.090 --> 00:10:05.100 align:start position:0%
there needed to be so that the goal of
 
00:10:07.130 --> 00:10:07.140 align:start position:0%
being able to communicate better and
 
00:10:09.050 --> 00:10:09.060 align:start position:0%
having more transparency and I hope
 
00:10:11.630 --> 00:10:11.640 align:start position:0%
providing real-time information to
 
00:10:13.670 --> 00:10:13.680 align:start position:0%
municipalities and others who who want
 
00:10:15.470 --> 00:10:15.480 align:start position:0%
to know and and when I say
 
00:10:17.389 --> 00:10:17.399 align:start position:0%
municipalities what I would imagine is
 
00:10:19.430 --> 00:10:19.440 align:start position:0%
that you know somebody who has one of
 
00:10:20.930 --> 00:10:20.940 align:start position:0%
these on their land or outside their
 
00:10:23.329 --> 00:10:23.339 align:start position:0%
house or something like that
 
00:10:25.730 --> 00:10:25.740 align:start position:0%
um could contact the municipality in the
 
00:10:27.470 --> 00:10:27.480 align:start position:0%
municipality would then be able to get
 
00:10:30.290 --> 00:10:30.300 align:start position:0%
access to the data system and thereby
 
00:10:33.050 --> 00:10:33.060 align:start position:0%
communicate with the with the utilities
 
00:10:34.630 --> 00:10:34.640 align:start position:0%
that have to do the work
 
00:10:36.829 --> 00:10:36.839 align:start position:0%
but I think we'll hear more about this
 
00:10:39.110 --> 00:10:39.120 align:start position:0%
from some of the other folks follow up
 
00:10:41.570 --> 00:10:41.580 align:start position:0%
yeah so so just just so I'm clear so so
 
00:10:43.250 --> 00:10:43.260 align:start position:0%
the State of Affairs right now is that
 
00:10:45.769 --> 00:10:45.779 align:start position:0%
there really is not a single centralized
 
00:10:48.110 --> 00:10:48.120 align:start position:0%
database no and and that would be
 
00:10:51.110 --> 00:10:51.120 align:start position:0%
perhaps one of the desired outcomes of
 
00:10:52.630 --> 00:10:52.640 align:start position:0%
all this work
 
00:10:54.590 --> 00:10:54.600 align:start position:0%
you know a single one or wants to
 
00:10:56.030 --> 00:10:56.040 align:start position:0%
communicate could communicate with each
 
00:10:57.889 --> 00:10:57.899 align:start position:0%
other I mean you know there's a lot of
 
00:10:59.750 --> 00:10:59.760 align:start position:0%
ways to get the same thing done we just
 
00:11:04.069 --> 00:11:04.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:07.069 --> 00:11:07.079 align:start position:0%
representative closure has a question uh
 
00:11:08.930 --> 00:11:08.940 align:start position:0%
thank you chair thank you Senator Waters
 
00:11:10.790 --> 00:11:10.800 align:start position:0%
taking the question has there been any
 
00:11:14.389 --> 00:11:14.399 align:start position:0%
discussion on uh abandoned lines from
 
00:11:16.730 --> 00:11:16.740 align:start position:0%
Pole to pull and to Consumers I
 
00:11:19.430 --> 00:11:19.440 align:start position:0%
understand a lot of the old cable lines
 
00:11:22.190 --> 00:11:22.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:23.269 --> 00:11:23.279 align:start position:0%
um I'm just thanks for the question I'm
 
00:11:24.710 --> 00:11:24.720 align:start position:0%
not sure the best I'm the best one to
 
00:11:27.170 --> 00:11:27.180 align:start position:0%
answer answer this uh and I just don't
 
00:11:28.730 --> 00:11:28.740 align:start position:0%
recall whether we got into some of those
 
00:11:31.610 --> 00:11:31.620 align:start position:0%
other issues in the in the um study
 
00:11:32.810 --> 00:11:32.820 align:start position:0%
committee or perhaps representative
 
00:11:35.389 --> 00:11:35.399 align:start position:0%
Grody or some representative utility
 
00:11:38.750 --> 00:11:38.760 align:start position:0%
will be able to address that
 
00:11:41.389 --> 00:11:41.399 align:start position:0%
representative that's a question thank
 
00:11:43.610 --> 00:11:43.620 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair
 
00:11:45.470 --> 00:11:45.480 align:start position:0%
the the polls that we're discussing here
 
00:11:48.829 --> 00:11:48.839 align:start position:0%
are polls in the distribution Network or
 
00:11:50.509 --> 00:11:50.519 align:start position:0%
does it also include polls in the
 
00:11:54.710 --> 00:11:54.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:57.050 --> 00:11:57.060 align:start position:0%
uh uh I'm not sure I can give you the
 
00:12:00.530 --> 00:12:00.540 align:start position:0%
right answer on that follow-up
 
00:12:03.110 --> 00:12:03.120 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm from Berlin and the co-wash loop
 
00:12:04.550 --> 00:12:04.560 align:start position:0%
runs through there and currently ever
 
00:12:06.769 --> 00:12:06.779 align:start position:0%
source is working on that that's why I
 
00:12:08.509 --> 00:12:08.519 align:start position:0%
asked the question yeah
 
00:12:11.090 --> 00:12:11.100 align:start position:0%
um thanks for the question and I I think
 
00:12:13.130 --> 00:12:13.140 align:start position:0%
that we are talking about distribution
 
00:12:14.569 --> 00:12:14.579 align:start position:0%
here because these are you know these
 
00:12:20.210 --> 00:12:20.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:22.310 --> 00:12:22.320 align:start position:0%
okay seeing no further questions I want
 
00:12:23.569 --> 00:12:23.579 align:start position:0%

um the attendance was very strong and if
 
00:12:59.629 --> 00:12:59.639 align:start position:0%
you'd like I can send you a link to the
 
00:13:02.329 --> 00:13:02.339 align:start position:0%
reports and the minutes of the um
 
00:13:04.370 --> 00:13:04.380 align:start position:0%
Commission because it might help address
 
00:13:06.850 --> 00:13:06.860 align:start position:0%
many of the concerns that you have
 
00:13:10.850 --> 00:13:10.860 align:start position:0%
there were three things that we needed
 
00:13:12.889 --> 00:13:12.899 align:start position:0%
we felt as a commission that we needed
 
00:13:15.530 --> 00:13:15.540 align:start position:0%
to address one was the customer
 
00:13:17.990 --> 00:13:18.000 align:start position:0%
complaints that people had with double
 
00:13:20.629 --> 00:13:20.639 align:start position:0%
utility polls in their area
 
00:13:22.790 --> 00:13:22.800 align:start position:0%
the other was the difficulty that
 
00:13:26.110 --> 00:13:26.120 align:start position:0%
municipalities had in learning in about
 
00:13:29.150 --> 00:13:29.160 align:start position:0%
how these poll situations were being
 
00:13:31.490 --> 00:13:31.500 align:start position:0%
addressed and then thirdly the
 
00:13:34.190 --> 00:13:34.200 align:start position:0%
communication between
 
00:13:36.230 --> 00:13:36.240 align:start position:0%
I'll say the providers on the utility
 
00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:37.670 align:start position:0%
I'll say the providers on the utility
polls

00:13:37.670 --> 00:13:37.680 align:start position:0%
polls
 
00:13:40.970 --> 00:13:40.980 align:start position:0%
utility polls are owned by
 
00:13:40.980 --> 00:13:42.350 align:start position:0%
utility polls are owned by
uh

00:13:42.350 --> 00:13:42.360 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:13:44.750 --> 00:13:44.760 align:start position:0%
electricity providers
 
00:13:49.030 --> 00:13:49.040 align:start position:0%
so they each have poll ownership
 
00:13:52.069 --> 00:13:52.079 align:start position:0%
and they allow
 
00:13:55.670 --> 00:13:55.680 align:start position:0%
um through agreements the use of their
 
00:13:57.710 --> 00:13:57.720 align:start position:0%
telephone poles of their utility poles
 
00:14:00.670 --> 00:14:00.680 align:start position:0%
by Cable telephone
 
00:14:03.710 --> 00:14:03.720 align:start position:0%
fire alarm companies
 
00:14:08.269 --> 00:14:08.279 align:start position:0%
and these all this is registered in the
 
00:14:10.670 --> 00:14:10.680 align:start position:0%
database called engines
 
00:14:14.030 --> 00:14:14.040 align:start position:0%
and most utility companies use engines
 
00:14:16.850 --> 00:14:16.860 align:start position:0%
as their database
 
00:14:20.569 --> 00:14:20.579 align:start position:0%
however the difficulty comes in when you
 
00:14:23.810 --> 00:14:23.820 align:start position:0%
have a pull replacement and tickets are
 
00:14:26.509 --> 00:14:26.519 align:start position:0%
issued and then unless that information
 
00:14:29.990 --> 00:14:30.000 align:start position:0%
about that particularly that particular
 
00:14:33.050 --> 00:14:33.060 align:start position:0%
service provider switching their poll if
 
00:14:35.210 --> 00:14:35.220 align:start position:0%
that information isn't put into the
 
00:14:35.220 --> 00:14:36.230 align:start position:0%
that information isn't put into the
system

00:14:36.230 --> 00:14:36.240 align:start position:0%
system
 
00:14:38.629 --> 00:14:38.639 align:start position:0%
then it doesn't trigger The Next Step
 
00:14:41.629 --> 00:14:41.639 align:start position:0%
so there's this difficulty in actually
 
00:14:43.790 --> 00:14:43.800 align:start position:0%
inputting the data in the system and
 
00:14:45.470 --> 00:14:45.480 align:start position:0%
keeping it fresh
 
00:14:48.650 --> 00:14:48.660 align:start position:0%
so rather than
 
00:14:51.410 --> 00:14:51.420 align:start position:0%
um legislation to address this what we
 
00:14:54.650 --> 00:14:54.660 align:start position:0%
chose to do because the participants in
 
00:14:58.430 --> 00:14:58.440 align:start position:0%
the commission were so eager to solve
 
00:15:00.350 --> 00:15:00.360 align:start position:0%
this problem because they've recognized
 
00:15:02.509 --> 00:15:02.519 align:start position:0%
it as an issue as well we put together
 
00:15:05.150 --> 00:15:05.160 align:start position:0%
this task force it is large because it
 
00:15:07.670 --> 00:15:07.680 align:start position:0%
represents everyone who's involved in
 
00:15:09.530 --> 00:15:09.540 align:start position:0%
this industry and they all wanted a
 
00:15:12.889 --> 00:15:12.899 align:start position:0%
voice in it so we're hoping that
 
00:15:14.990 --> 00:15:15.000 align:start position:0%
um through their as soon as this
 
00:15:16.970 --> 00:15:16.980 align:start position:0%
commission is as soon as this task force
 
00:15:19.009 --> 00:15:19.019 align:start position:0%
is established they're ready to get to
 
00:15:21.970 --> 00:15:21.980 align:start position:0%
work and the um and Mr
 
00:15:24.110 --> 00:15:24.120 align:start position:0%
the individual from the Department of
 
00:15:26.210 --> 00:15:26.220 align:start position:0%
energy and their individuals from the
 
00:15:28.490 --> 00:15:28.500 align:start position:0%
utilities are here and I would certainly
 
00:15:31.250 --> 00:15:31.260 align:start position:0%
recommend that you ask them questions
 
00:15:34.430 --> 00:15:34.440 align:start position:0%
but I'll be glad to address any concerns
 
00:15:37.670 --> 00:15:37.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:40.730 --> 00:15:40.740 align:start position:0%
thank you representative questions for
 
00:15:42.650 --> 00:15:42.660 align:start position:0%
the representative
 
00:15:45.949 --> 00:15:45.959 align:start position:0%
representative Noel has a question
 
00:15:48.170 --> 00:15:48.180 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
00:15:50.810 --> 00:15:50.820 align:start position:0%
good morning I'd like to ask my
 
00:15:53.230 --> 00:15:53.240 align:start position:0%
previous question about the transmission
 
00:15:56.530 --> 00:15:56.540 align:start position:0%
it doesn't involve transmission lines
 
00:15:58.790 --> 00:15:58.800 align:start position:0%
thank you no
 
00:16:01.069 --> 00:16:01.079 align:start position:0%
and it really only addresses
 
00:16:03.650 --> 00:16:03.660 align:start position:0%
utility poles
 
00:16:08.210 --> 00:16:08.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:10.069 --> 00:16:10.079 align:start position:0%
representative Doug Thomas has a
 
00:16:11.629 --> 00:16:11.639 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair thank you
 
00:16:13.550 --> 00:16:13.560 align:start position:0%
for taking my question I'm looking at
 
00:16:18.110 --> 00:16:18.120 align:start position:0%
the bill here and I I don't see a Sunset
 
00:16:21.889 --> 00:16:21.899 align:start position:0%
date in it is is there is this supposed
 
00:16:24.290 --> 00:16:24.300 align:start position:0%
to be an ongoing task force for forever
 
00:16:26.990 --> 00:16:27.000 align:start position:0%
or is it something just to establish how
 
00:16:28.370 --> 00:16:28.380 align:start position:0%
the utilities are going to work together
 
00:16:30.949 --> 00:16:30.959 align:start position:0%
and to get this job done I I'm just kind
 
00:16:32.990 --> 00:16:33.000 align:start position:0%
of curious if this is a perpetuating
 
00:16:35.569 --> 00:16:35.579 align:start position:0%
task force or not I would think that
 
00:16:37.069 --> 00:16:37.079 align:start position:0%
this task force is going to be meeting
 
00:16:39.949 --> 00:16:39.959 align:start position:0%
for quite some time because the I think
 
00:16:42.530 --> 00:16:42.540 align:start position:0%
the task force will govern itself
 
00:16:46.129 --> 00:16:46.139 align:start position:0%
and um I did not think of a Sunset date
 
00:16:47.930 --> 00:16:47.940 align:start position:0%
when we put the bill together so that
 
00:16:50.389 --> 00:16:50.399 align:start position:0%
might be a question that you could ask
 
00:16:53.230 --> 00:16:53.240 align:start position:0%
um Mr krasker from the
 
00:16:55.730 --> 00:16:55.740 align:start position:0%
Department of energy perhaps but I don't
 
00:16:57.290 --> 00:16:57.300 align:start position:0%
see this as something that this is not
 
00:16:58.850 --> 00:16:58.860 align:start position:0%
going to be a quick fix this is going to
 
00:17:00.110 --> 00:17:00.120 align:start position:0%
take some time
 
00:17:03.829 --> 00:17:03.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:07.010 --> 00:17:07.020 align:start position:0%
representative Bernardi has a question
 
00:17:10.370 --> 00:17:10.380 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh so the engine
 
00:17:14.750 --> 00:17:14.760 align:start position:0%
system as I'm understanding it uh
 
00:17:17.750 --> 00:17:17.760 align:start position:0%
some companies use it some companies
 
00:17:20.689 --> 00:17:20.699 align:start position:0%
don't and part of the problem is the
 
00:17:22.970 --> 00:17:22.980 align:start position:0%
system is not routinely updated when
 
00:17:25.669 --> 00:17:25.679 align:start position:0%
work is done correct is that correct
 
00:17:28.490 --> 00:17:28.500 align:start position:0%
correct and engines is a national it's
 
00:17:29.870 --> 00:17:29.880 align:start position:0%
just not dedicated to New Hampshire
 
00:17:32.930 --> 00:17:32.940 align:start position:0%
engines is a National Database that's
 
00:17:35.510 --> 00:17:35.520 align:start position:0%
used by many utilities so it's you know
 
00:17:37.669 --> 00:17:37.679 align:start position:0%
it's designed and it hasn't been
 
00:17:39.650 --> 00:17:39.660 align:start position:0%
redesigned in a long time so it could be
 
00:17:41.330 --> 00:17:41.340 align:start position:0%
that the needs are different because
 
00:17:44.450 --> 00:17:44.460 align:start position:0%
this issue of the double utility poles
 
00:17:47.090 --> 00:17:47.100 align:start position:0%
is not unique to New Hampshire
 
00:17:48.710 --> 00:17:48.720 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
00:17:52.850 --> 00:17:52.860 align:start position:0%
follow up uh thank you uh so which
 
00:17:55.669 --> 00:17:55.679 align:start position:0%
Utilities in New Hampshire do not use
 
00:17:55.679 --> 00:17:58.070 align:start position:0%
Utilities in New Hampshire do not use
engines

00:17:58.070 --> 00:17:58.080 align:start position:0%
engines
 
00:18:00.350 --> 00:18:00.360 align:start position:0%
I remember correctly it is in the nose
 
00:18:02.210 --> 00:18:02.220 align:start position:0%
but I remember if I remember correctly
 
00:18:05.029 --> 00:18:05.039 align:start position:0%
Unitil does not belong to engines
 
00:18:07.610 --> 00:18:07.620 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:18:10.789 --> 00:18:10.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:13.130 --> 00:18:13.140 align:start position:0%
you off the top of your head know what
 
00:18:15.669 --> 00:18:15.679 align:start position:0%
the acronym
 
00:18:17.810 --> 00:18:17.820 align:start position:0%
nj-u-n-s stands for
 
00:18:20.870 --> 00:18:20.880 align:start position:0%
um no I don't remember sorry okay
 
00:18:23.029 --> 00:18:23.039 align:start position:0%
I'll ask others thank you Mr chairman
 
00:18:25.310 --> 00:18:25.320 align:start position:0%
it's a representative Reynolds has a
 
00:18:27.230 --> 00:18:27.240 align:start position:0%
question National joint utilities
 
00:18:30.590 --> 00:18:30.600 align:start position:0%
notification system ah you found that
 
00:18:35.390 --> 00:18:35.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:37.490 --> 00:18:37.500 align:start position:0%
okay seeing no further questions we want
 
00:18:38.870 --> 00:18:38.880 align:start position:0%
to thank you representative for taking
 
00:18:40.549 --> 00:18:40.559 align:start position:0%
time out of your day to be here to tell
 
00:18:42.770 --> 00:18:42.780 align:start position:0%
us about uh this bill give us more
 
00:18:44.630 --> 00:18:44.640 align:start position:0%
explanation thank you
 
00:18:47.029 --> 00:18:47.039 align:start position:0%

robarge from
 
00:18:54.049 --> 00:18:54.059 align:start position:0%
uh the department of energy also with
 
00:18:55.730 --> 00:18:55.740 align:start position:0%
him is Paul
 
00:18:57.529 --> 00:18:57.539 align:start position:0%
esper I think
 
00:19:00.409 --> 00:19:00.419 align:start position:0%
so welcome gentlemen
 
00:19:02.090 --> 00:19:02.100 align:start position:0%

00:19:02.100 --> 00:19:05.029 align:start position:0%
give us your perspective on this
legislation

00:19:05.029 --> 00:19:05.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:07.789 --> 00:19:07.799 align:start position:0%
uh thank you members of the committee
 
00:19:09.770 --> 00:19:09.780 align:start position:0%
um for the record Griffin Roberts State
 
00:19:11.390 --> 00:19:11.400 align:start position:0%
energy program manager at the department
 
00:19:13.549 --> 00:19:13.559 align:start position:0%
of energy with me today is Paul Casper
 
00:19:15.529 --> 00:19:15.539 align:start position:0%
our director of our enforcement division
 
00:19:18.049 --> 00:19:18.059 align:start position:0%
the department is in support of Senate
 
00:19:20.510 --> 00:19:20.520 align:start position:0%
bill 16. um as has been previously
 
00:19:24.289 --> 00:19:24.299 align:start position:0%
mentioned the Genesis of this bill uh
 
00:19:26.570 --> 00:19:26.580 align:start position:0%
comes from a study commission that was
 
00:19:28.010 --> 00:19:28.020 align:start position:0%
formed last year through representative
 
00:19:31.850 --> 00:19:31.860 align:start position:0%
grody's House Bill 169 that study
 
00:19:33.590 --> 00:19:33.600 align:start position:0%
commission met a handful of times
 
00:19:35.990 --> 00:19:36.000 align:start position:0%
between October and November of last
 
00:19:39.230 --> 00:19:39.240 align:start position:0%
year and this bill is the product of
 
00:19:42.049 --> 00:19:42.059 align:start position:0%
that study commission as you'll if you
 
00:19:43.370 --> 00:19:43.380 align:start position:0%
read the reports one of the
 
00:19:43.380 --> 00:19:45.250 align:start position:0%
read the reports one of the
recommendations

00:19:45.250 --> 00:19:45.260 align:start position:0%
recommendations
 
00:19:48.049 --> 00:19:48.059 align:start position:0%
as broadly as possible the bill creates
 
00:19:49.250 --> 00:19:49.260 align:start position:0%
a stakeholder group within the
 
00:19:50.870 --> 00:19:50.880 align:start position:0%
department to address utility poll and
 
00:19:53.570 --> 00:19:53.580 align:start position:0%
attachments the stakeholder group will
 
00:19:55.130 --> 00:19:55.140 align:start position:0%
look primarily at improving
 
00:19:57.770 --> 00:19:57.780 align:start position:0%
Communications amongst poll attached
 
00:20:01.010 --> 00:20:01.020 align:start position:0%
poll owners and attaches and addressing
 
00:20:02.409 --> 00:20:02.419 align:start position:0%
the functionality of current
 
00:20:04.850 --> 00:20:04.860 align:start position:0%
administrative Rule and state statute
 
00:20:07.010 --> 00:20:07.020 align:start position:0%
and then toward the bottom of the bill
 
00:20:09.169 --> 00:20:09.179 align:start position:0%
you'll see that per by November 1 of
 
00:20:10.669 --> 00:20:10.679 align:start position:0%
every year the department has to submit
 
00:20:13.070 --> 00:20:13.080 align:start position:0%
reports to the legislature about the
 
00:20:15.169 --> 00:20:15.179 align:start position:0%
stakeholders group and again with me
 
00:20:17.270 --> 00:20:17.280 align:start position:0%
today is Paul from our enforcement
 
00:20:19.130 --> 00:20:19.140 align:start position:0%
division he's our director and I'll let
 
00:20:23.810 --> 00:20:23.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:26.630 --> 00:20:26.640 align:start position:0%
good morning everyone
 
00:20:29.029 --> 00:20:29.039 align:start position:0%
I guess to start this just to give you
 
00:20:31.909 --> 00:20:31.919 align:start position:0%
some perspective of the issue of double
 
00:20:34.850 --> 00:20:34.860 align:start position:0%
polls double polls are created in two
 
00:20:34.860 --> 00:20:36.230 align:start position:0%
polls double polls are created in two
ways

00:20:36.230 --> 00:20:36.240 align:start position:0%
ways
 
00:20:38.990 --> 00:20:39.000 align:start position:0%
one of the ways is to make ready work
 
00:20:42.049 --> 00:20:42.059 align:start position:0%
and this is where
 
00:20:44.890 --> 00:20:44.900 align:start position:0%
there's a either the electric utilities
 
00:20:48.409 --> 00:20:48.419 align:start position:0%
uh the Telcom utility those are the two
 
00:20:51.770 --> 00:20:51.780 align:start position:0%
entities that normally own the polls
 
00:20:53.870 --> 00:20:53.880 align:start position:0%
they own them either separately or
 
00:20:53.880 --> 00:20:54.950 align:start position:0%
they own them either separately or
jointly

00:20:54.950 --> 00:20:54.960 align:start position:0%
jointly
 
00:20:59.870 --> 00:20:59.880 align:start position:0%
in their petitioned by fiber companies
 
00:21:02.510 --> 00:21:02.520 align:start position:0%
that are coming along even towns that
 
00:21:04.909 --> 00:21:04.919 align:start position:0%
want to put fire alarm up and they come
 
00:21:07.549 --> 00:21:07.559 align:start position:0%
across a certain number of polls that
 
00:21:09.770 --> 00:21:09.780 align:start position:0%
aren't tall enough to create the amount
 
00:21:13.070 --> 00:21:13.080 align:start position:0%
of clearance that's required so the
 
00:21:14.930 --> 00:21:14.940 align:start position:0%
utility weather electric or telephone
 
00:21:17.450 --> 00:21:17.460 align:start position:0%
will set a new poll
 
00:21:20.570 --> 00:21:20.580 align:start position:0%
and the first one to transfer is always
 
00:21:24.049 --> 00:21:24.059 align:start position:0%
the electric companies they do it both
 
00:21:26.690 --> 00:21:26.700 align:start position:0%
instances it's the electric company and
 
00:21:29.409 --> 00:21:29.419 align:start position:0%
this is where engines kicks in now
 
00:21:32.090 --> 00:21:32.100 align:start position:0%
Unitil isn't a member of engines they
 
00:21:34.990 --> 00:21:35.000 align:start position:0%
didn't join it but you know till
 
00:21:37.750 --> 00:21:37.760 align:start position:0%
contacts anybody that's
 
00:21:41.510 --> 00:21:41.520 align:start position:0%
attached in their service territory or
 
00:21:44.090 --> 00:21:44.100 align:start position:0%
in on their poles or joint polls and
 
00:21:46.669 --> 00:21:46.679 align:start position:0%
notifies them we've transferred at such
 
00:21:50.690 --> 00:21:50.700 align:start position:0%
and such a location you are next
 
00:21:52.909 --> 00:21:52.919 align:start position:0%
the the other incident that creates
 
00:21:56.350 --> 00:21:56.360 align:start position:0%
double poles obviously are accidents and
 
00:21:59.750 --> 00:21:59.760 align:start position:0%
storms and some one of the Senators
 
00:22:02.029 --> 00:22:02.039 align:start position:0%
earlier talked about the storm well this
 
00:22:05.029 --> 00:22:05.039 align:start position:0%
past storm that we had uh just a couple
 
00:22:06.289 --> 00:22:06.299 align:start position:0%
of weeks ago
 
00:22:10.610 --> 00:22:10.620 align:start position:0%
it damaged 700 poles
 
00:22:14.390 --> 00:22:14.400 align:start position:0%
so let's say that out of those 700 500
 
00:22:17.390 --> 00:22:17.400 align:start position:0%
now a double poles
 
00:22:19.669 --> 00:22:19.679 align:start position:0%
because they don't always replace
 
00:22:21.890 --> 00:22:21.900 align:start position:0%
the damage pull sometimes it's just
 
00:22:23.750 --> 00:22:23.760 align:start position:0%
damaged enough with a set of new pole
 
00:22:25.549 --> 00:22:25.559 align:start position:0%
and again I want to make it perfectly
 
00:22:28.430 --> 00:22:28.440 align:start position:0%
clear when a new pole is set the
 
00:22:31.190 --> 00:22:31.200 align:start position:0%
electric company transfers immediately
 
00:22:33.770 --> 00:22:33.780 align:start position:0%
because they require it to
 
00:22:37.010 --> 00:22:37.020 align:start position:0%
and then the process begins it sits it's
 
00:22:39.310 --> 00:22:39.320 align:start position:0%
they're waiting for the next one down
 
00:22:41.810 --> 00:22:41.820 align:start position:0%
generally it could be
 
00:22:44.810 --> 00:22:44.820 align:start position:0%
um cable TV it has a tendency to be the
 
00:22:46.909 --> 00:22:46.919 align:start position:0%
next one down so they were all notified
 
00:22:49.010 --> 00:22:49.020 align:start position:0%
through engines if they belong to it
 
00:22:50.690 --> 00:22:50.700 align:start position:0%
even though they belong to it doesn't
 
00:22:52.669 --> 00:22:52.679 align:start position:0%
mean they're going to do it
 
00:22:56.029 --> 00:22:56.039 align:start position:0%
that's just a mechanism for them to all
 
00:22:56.039 --> 00:22:57.169 align:start position:0%
that's just a mechanism for them to all
use

00:22:57.169 --> 00:22:57.179 align:start position:0%
use
 
00:22:59.210 --> 00:22:59.220 align:start position:0%
and I could and I can just tell you from
 
00:23:01.490 --> 00:23:01.500 align:start position:0%
my own experience just being the
 
00:23:03.890 --> 00:23:03.900 align:start position:0%
director of enforcement I get calls
 
00:23:03.900 --> 00:23:05.210 align:start position:0%
director of enforcement I get calls
constantly

00:23:05.210 --> 00:23:05.220 align:start position:0%
constantly
 
00:23:08.990 --> 00:23:09.000 align:start position:0%
customers towns there's a big problem
 
00:23:12.669 --> 00:23:12.679 align:start position:0%
somebody asked about how many are there
 
00:23:15.830 --> 00:23:15.840 align:start position:0%
it would be a tough guess it's in the
 
00:23:19.549 --> 00:23:19.559 align:start position:0%
thousands or tens of thousands
 
00:23:23.450 --> 00:23:23.460 align:start position:0%
just in a through say a three block
 
00:23:25.850 --> 00:23:25.860 align:start position:0%
radius around this building I could take
 
00:23:27.830 --> 00:23:27.840 align:start position:0%
you out and probably find you ten double
 
00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:29.570 align:start position:0%
you out and probably find you ten double
poles

00:23:29.570 --> 00:23:29.580 align:start position:0%
poles
 
00:23:31.850 --> 00:23:31.860 align:start position:0%
that have been there a while it doesn't
 
00:23:34.370 --> 00:23:34.380 align:start position:0%
transfer quickly I actually have a fold
 
00:23:36.950 --> 00:23:36.960 align:start position:0%
here with photographs I had sent one of
 
00:23:40.190 --> 00:23:40.200 align:start position:0%
my inspectors out a while back he found
 
00:23:41.870 --> 00:23:41.880 align:start position:0%
a double poll that's been waiting 12
 
00:23:41.880 --> 00:23:43.010 align:start position:0%
a double poll that's been waiting 12
years

00:23:43.010 --> 00:23:43.020 align:start position:0%
years
 
00:23:46.490 --> 00:23:46.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:49.250 --> 00:23:49.260 align:start position:0%
and the reason was we couldn't get in
 
00:23:50.510 --> 00:23:50.520 align:start position:0%
the gate
 
00:23:53.090 --> 00:23:53.100 align:start position:0%
this is over in the Hampton Beach area
 
00:23:56.270 --> 00:23:56.280 align:start position:0%
it's interesting our employee found a
 
00:23:58.669 --> 00:23:58.679 align:start position:0%
sign on the fence called the number on
 
00:23:59.990 --> 00:24:00.000 align:start position:0%
the gentleman that had the key to the
 
00:24:02.090 --> 00:24:02.100 align:start position:0%
fence came right out and opened the
 
00:24:02.100 --> 00:24:03.409 align:start position:0%
fence came right out and opened the
phone

00:24:03.409 --> 00:24:03.419 align:start position:0%
phone
 
00:24:06.350 --> 00:24:06.360 align:start position:0%
we contacted Consolidated Communications
 
00:24:08.930 --> 00:24:08.940 align:start position:0%
because for the last 12 years they
 
00:24:10.070 --> 00:24:10.080 align:start position:0%
couldn't transfer it because they
 
00:24:11.990 --> 00:24:12.000 align:start position:0%
couldn't get in there
 
00:24:15.470 --> 00:24:15.480 align:start position:0%
so and this is not please take this not
 
00:24:16.850 --> 00:24:16.860 align:start position:0%
as a finger point
 
00:24:19.669 --> 00:24:19.679 align:start position:0%
uh I've had several meetings there's
 
00:24:21.850 --> 00:24:21.860 align:start position:0%
several States throughout the country
 
00:24:26.750 --> 00:24:26.760 align:start position:0%
where we meet on teams periodically uh
 
00:24:29.210 --> 00:24:29.220 align:start position:0%
in my counterparts and we talk about
 
00:24:32.090 --> 00:24:32.100 align:start position:0%
issues common issues among states number
 
00:24:35.149 --> 00:24:35.159 align:start position:0%
one issue double polls
 
00:24:38.450 --> 00:24:38.460 align:start position:0%
and uh one of the states uh the state of
 
00:24:40.970 --> 00:24:40.980 align:start position:0%
Washington that how they addressed it
 
00:24:42.710 --> 00:24:42.720 align:start position:0%
they brought everybody to the table
 
00:24:44.630 --> 00:24:44.640 align:start position:0%
probably in a similar manner what we're
 
00:24:45.789 --> 00:24:45.799 align:start position:0%
trying to do
 
00:24:48.289 --> 00:24:48.299 align:start position:0%
they got all the utilities in Washington
 
00:24:51.649 --> 00:24:51.659 align:start position:0%
to agree that
 
00:24:55.430 --> 00:24:55.440 align:start position:0%
um especially the telecom companies that
 
00:24:56.930 --> 00:24:56.940 align:start position:0%
they would there's one particular
 
00:24:59.510 --> 00:24:59.520 align:start position:0%
contractor that they use that transfers
 
00:24:59.520 --> 00:25:01.310 align:start position:0%
contractor that they use that transfers
everybody

00:25:01.310 --> 00:25:01.320 align:start position:0%
everybody
 
00:25:03.950 --> 00:25:03.960 align:start position:0%
takes transfers it and pulls the old
 
00:25:05.510 --> 00:25:05.520 align:start position:0%
poll what they refer to on the business
 
00:25:07.669 --> 00:25:07.679 align:start position:0%
as pull the butt out of the ground so
 
00:25:09.169 --> 00:25:09.179 align:start position:0%
this is only one pole left in
 
00:25:12.289 --> 00:25:12.299 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:15.289 --> 00:25:15.299 align:start position:0%
it's not easy but it's certainly taken
 
00:25:17.029 --> 00:25:17.039 align:start position:0%
care of
 
00:25:20.750 --> 00:25:20.760 align:start position:0%
the double pole issue we in one as one
 
00:25:22.549 --> 00:25:22.559 align:start position:0%
of the Senators this just we have triple
 
00:25:24.590 --> 00:25:24.600 align:start position:0%
polls out there
 
00:25:28.850 --> 00:25:28.860 align:start position:0%
and I I guess from my perspective I'm
 
00:25:31.490 --> 00:25:31.500 align:start position:0%
passionate about this uh it's a safety
 
00:25:31.500 --> 00:25:32.390 align:start position:0%
passionate about this uh it's a safety
issue

00:25:32.390 --> 00:25:32.400 align:start position:0%
issue
 
00:25:34.370 --> 00:25:34.380 align:start position:0%
it's not just because they don't look
 
00:25:34.380 --> 00:25:35.269 align:start position:0%
it's not just because they don't look
pretty

00:25:35.269 --> 00:25:35.279 align:start position:0%
pretty
 
00:25:38.090 --> 00:25:38.100 align:start position:0%
but eventually you know what happens is
 
00:25:40.789 --> 00:25:40.799 align:start position:0%
how they how they do this they a poll
 
00:25:43.070 --> 00:25:43.080 align:start position:0%
gets hit they send a new one and they
 
00:25:44.930 --> 00:25:44.940 align:start position:0%
send it as close together as possible
 
00:25:47.210 --> 00:25:47.220 align:start position:0%
and it's and the old pole might be
 
00:25:50.269 --> 00:25:50.279 align:start position:0%
lagged to the new one on lashed with
 
00:25:51.890 --> 00:25:51.900 align:start position:0%
lashing wire
 
00:25:54.110 --> 00:25:54.120 align:start position:0%
well if you're waiting too long so
 
00:25:56.029 --> 00:25:56.039 align:start position:0%
what's a reasonable amount of time that
 
00:25:57.529 --> 00:25:57.539 align:start position:0%
we should expect that pulse to be
 
00:25:57.539 --> 00:25:58.610 align:start position:0%
we should expect that pulse to be
transferred

00:25:58.610 --> 00:25:58.620 align:start position:0%
transferred
 
00:26:02.930 --> 00:26:02.940 align:start position:0%
12 years I think that's excessive myself
 
00:26:05.029 --> 00:26:05.039 align:start position:0%
how about even a year
 
00:26:07.010 --> 00:26:07.020 align:start position:0%
but even two years
 
00:26:10.310 --> 00:26:10.320 align:start position:0%
this lashing gets deteriorated
 
00:26:12.049 --> 00:26:12.059 align:start position:0%
in fact
 
00:26:15.470 --> 00:26:15.480 align:start position:0%
my partner here came in one morning and
 
00:26:17.570 --> 00:26:17.580 align:start position:0%
had pictures for me of a poll that he
 
00:26:19.789 --> 00:26:19.799 align:start position:0%
drove by on the way to work that was
 
00:26:22.430 --> 00:26:22.440 align:start position:0%
dangerously leaning over the road
 
00:26:24.409 --> 00:26:24.419 align:start position:0%
and I contacted the utility and they
 
00:26:27.350 --> 00:26:27.360 align:start position:0%
went back out there to show it back up
 
00:26:29.450 --> 00:26:29.460 align:start position:0%
so there
 
00:26:32.690 --> 00:26:32.700 align:start position:0%
that's the biggest issue besides you
 
00:26:36.049 --> 00:26:36.059 align:start position:0%
know the Aesthetics you know I believe
 
00:26:40.250 --> 00:26:40.260 align:start position:0%
that representative grody's committee
 
00:26:43.730 --> 00:26:43.740 align:start position:0%
everybody was at the table and I don't
 
00:26:45.289 --> 00:26:45.299 align:start position:0%
want to be unfair to the utilities
 
00:26:48.049 --> 00:26:48.059 align:start position:0%
because I look at all the utilities and
 
00:26:50.690 --> 00:26:50.700 align:start position:0%
you know 97 of the time they do an
 
00:26:51.890 --> 00:26:51.900 align:start position:0%
excellent job
 
00:26:54.890 --> 00:26:54.900 align:start position:0%
it's that three percent that we we
 
00:26:57.830 --> 00:26:57.840 align:start position:0%
really watch and work with them and this
 
00:26:59.690 --> 00:26:59.700 align:start position:0%
is one of those cases if we can bring
 
00:27:01.490 --> 00:27:01.500 align:start position:0%
them to the table come up with the
 
00:27:03.950 --> 00:27:03.960 align:start position:0%
solutions yeah engines is one of the
 
00:27:03.960 --> 00:27:05.750 align:start position:0%
solutions yeah engines is one of the
solutions

00:27:05.750 --> 00:27:05.760 align:start position:0%
solutions
 
00:27:08.690 --> 00:27:08.700 align:start position:0%
but if everybody joins engines
 
00:27:12.110 --> 00:27:12.120 align:start position:0%
in just I just I applied for a license
 
00:27:14.210 --> 00:27:14.220 align:start position:0%
to use engines I'm still waiting for the
 
00:27:17.769 --> 00:27:17.779 align:start position:0%
response I applied three months ago
 
00:27:21.049 --> 00:27:21.059 align:start position:0%
so things do take time but I mean I'll
 
00:27:23.630 --> 00:27:23.640 align:start position:0%
be persistent
 
00:27:25.970 --> 00:27:25.980 align:start position:0%
but I think if we get everybody to table
 
00:27:28.370 --> 00:27:28.380 align:start position:0%
and come up with Solutions there's a lot
 
00:27:31.190 --> 00:27:31.200 align:start position:0%
of attaches today and I'm sure a lot of
 
00:27:34.070 --> 00:27:34.080 align:start position:0%
the utilities the Telecom Comcast will
 
00:27:37.430 --> 00:27:37.440 align:start position:0%
tell you we have fidium now and Breeze
 
00:27:39.350 --> 00:27:39.360 align:start position:0%
line and we have all of you we have
 
00:27:42.950 --> 00:27:42.960 align:start position:0%
private fiber companies coming in so the
 
00:27:46.149 --> 00:27:46.159 align:start position:0%
polls are getting crowded
 
00:27:48.890 --> 00:27:48.900 align:start position:0%
you could drive down uh South Fruit
 
00:27:50.810 --> 00:27:50.820 align:start position:0%
Street just outside my office window
 
00:27:53.570 --> 00:27:53.580 align:start position:0%
counting it the other day there's seven
 
00:27:55.730 --> 00:27:55.740 align:start position:0%
telecommunication lines on the polls
 
00:27:55.740 --> 00:27:57.769 align:start position:0%
telecommunication lines on the polls
there

00:27:57.769 --> 00:27:57.779 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:27:57.779 --> 00:27:59.029 align:start position:0%
there
foreign

00:27:59.029 --> 00:27:59.039 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
00:28:01.730 --> 00:28:01.740 align:start position:0%
yes yes
 
00:28:03.769 --> 00:28:03.779 align:start position:0%
and you go ahead and finish and then
 
00:28:07.130 --> 00:28:07.140 align:start position:0%
we'll open it up to questions so it's
 
00:28:09.350 --> 00:28:09.360 align:start position:0%
it's growing if somebody else comes
 
00:28:12.289 --> 00:28:12.299 align:start position:0%
along now I'm sure unitil's gonna have
 
00:28:14.390 --> 00:28:14.400 align:start position:0%
to put on loopholes along until Fruit
 
00:28:15.890 --> 00:28:15.900 align:start position:0%
Street to accommodate the next one that
 
00:28:17.510 --> 00:28:17.520 align:start position:0%
wants to attach
 
00:28:21.110 --> 00:28:21.120 align:start position:0%
so it it it's it exponentially grows on
 
00:28:23.630 --> 00:28:23.640 align:start position:0%
a daily basis and then when we it gets
 
00:28:27.470 --> 00:28:27.480 align:start position:0%
exacerbated by storms I mean just as
 
00:28:29.450 --> 00:28:29.460 align:start position:0%
past Stars we had you know at
 
00:28:31.310 --> 00:28:31.320 align:start position:0%
Thanksgiving and Christmas and after
 
00:28:34.250 --> 00:28:34.260 align:start position:0%
these last two storms we had
 
00:28:37.370 --> 00:28:37.380 align:start position:0%
the winds take down you know we have 200
 
00:28:40.070 --> 00:28:40.080 align:start position:0%
Pine 200 foot pine trees here when those
 
00:28:42.769 --> 00:28:42.779 align:start position:0%
come down they do some damage
 
00:28:45.950 --> 00:28:45.960 align:start position:0%
it we end up with all of these extra
 
00:28:48.169 --> 00:28:48.179 align:start position:0%
double poles and they don't all get
 
00:28:51.830 --> 00:28:51.840 align:start position:0%
transferred expeditiously so I guess if
 
00:28:54.230 --> 00:28:54.240 align:start position:0%
we can bring everybody to the table and
 
00:28:56.810 --> 00:28:56.820 align:start position:0%
start talking let's find a solution
 
00:28:59.390 --> 00:28:59.400 align:start position:0%
there's a solution to everything but we
 
00:29:01.370 --> 00:29:01.380 align:start position:0%
all have to agree to it and we all have
 
00:29:03.409 --> 00:29:03.419 align:start position:0%
to put our heads together and say what's
 
00:29:06.230 --> 00:29:06.240 align:start position:0%
the real solution is it engines is it
 
00:29:09.230 --> 00:29:09.240 align:start position:0%
it's the commitment to using engines and
 
00:29:11.510 --> 00:29:11.520 align:start position:0%
responding when you are contacted to say
 
00:29:14.570 --> 00:29:14.580 align:start position:0%
you're next to transfer and go out there
 
00:29:16.610 --> 00:29:16.620 align:start position:0%
and do it within a reasonable amount of
 
00:29:16.620 --> 00:29:17.390 align:start position:0%
and do it within a reasonable amount of
time

00:29:17.390 --> 00:29:17.400 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:29:19.669 --> 00:29:19.679 align:start position:0%
not 12 years from now
 
00:29:23.870 --> 00:29:23.880 align:start position:0%
how about three weeks of a month yes
 
00:29:26.090 --> 00:29:26.100 align:start position:0%
everybody has problems with resources
 
00:29:28.850 --> 00:29:28.860 align:start position:0%
but but this is a real safety issue at
 
00:29:28.860 --> 00:29:30.889 align:start position:0%
but but this is a real safety issue at
High

00:29:30.889 --> 00:29:30.899 align:start position:0%
High
 
00:29:32.269 --> 00:29:32.279 align:start position:0%
and that's
 
00:29:34.310 --> 00:29:34.320 align:start position:0%
okay well thank you for that testimony
 
00:29:35.510 --> 00:29:35.520 align:start position:0%
we appreciate you being here
 
00:29:37.549 --> 00:29:37.559 align:start position:0%
representative McGee has a question for
 
00:29:39.409 --> 00:29:39.419 align:start position:0%
you thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
00:29:42.169 --> 00:29:42.179 align:start position:0%
for being here I appreciate your time
 
00:29:44.029 --> 00:29:44.039 align:start position:0%
um it it sounds like we really do need a
 
00:29:47.870 --> 00:29:47.880 align:start position:0%
strategic uh approach and my question is
 
00:29:50.149 --> 00:29:50.159 align:start position:0%
whether there is any federal money that
 
00:29:52.190 --> 00:29:52.200 align:start position:0%
you're aware of in the infrastructure
 
00:29:54.769 --> 00:29:54.779 align:start position:0%
act that's coming to states where you
 
00:29:57.049 --> 00:29:57.059 align:start position:0%
said that this is a this is not a New
 
00:29:58.549 --> 00:29:58.559 align:start position:0%
Hampshire exclusive issue right there
 
00:30:00.169 --> 00:30:00.179 align:start position:0%
are many places where they're looking to
 
00:30:02.930 --> 00:30:02.940 align:start position:0%
invest in updating and the maintenance
 
00:30:05.570 --> 00:30:05.580 align:start position:0%
of the infrastructure as far as both
 
00:30:08.750 --> 00:30:08.760 align:start position:0%
telecommunications and utility polls so
 
00:30:10.669 --> 00:30:10.679 align:start position:0%
I was just wondering whether there is
 
00:30:13.310 --> 00:30:13.320 align:start position:0%
any funding that's coming to states to
 
00:30:16.190 --> 00:30:16.200 align:start position:0%
assist with this to help speed it up
 
00:30:18.830 --> 00:30:18.840 align:start position:0%
I I don't know of any uh directly
 
00:30:22.130 --> 00:30:22.140 align:start position:0%
representative but Bill you know grants
 
00:30:23.210 --> 00:30:23.220 align:start position:0%
like you know
 
00:30:27.049 --> 00:30:27.059 align:start position:0%
um the Broadband build out yeah that
 
00:30:29.810 --> 00:30:29.820 align:start position:0%
would probably could be used for such
 
00:30:29.820 --> 00:30:31.909 align:start position:0%
would probably could be used for such
things

00:30:31.909 --> 00:30:31.919 align:start position:0%
things
 
00:30:34.909 --> 00:30:34.919 align:start position:0%
but the double poles that are created by
 
00:30:38.149 --> 00:30:38.159 align:start position:0%
by you know accidents or storms that's
 
00:30:41.570 --> 00:30:41.580 align:start position:0%
really on the utilities in in it's I
 
00:30:43.610 --> 00:30:43.620 align:start position:0%
don't know of any federal grants for
 
00:30:43.620 --> 00:30:44.930 align:start position:0%
don't know of any federal grants for
that

00:30:44.930 --> 00:30:44.940 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:30:44.940 --> 00:30:46.310 align:start position:0%
that
um

00:30:46.310 --> 00:30:46.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:46.320 --> 00:30:48.049 align:start position:0%
um
sure

00:30:48.049 --> 00:30:48.059 align:start position:0%
sure
 
00:30:49.970 --> 00:30:49.980 align:start position:0%
um there is some federal money in the
 
00:30:51.350 --> 00:30:51.360 align:start position:0%
infrastructure Bill obviously for greedy
 
00:30:53.330 --> 00:30:53.340 align:start position:0%
resiliency activities um and that type
 
00:30:55.850 --> 00:30:55.860 align:start position:0%
of thing but I think broadly when you
 
00:30:57.289 --> 00:30:57.299 align:start position:0%
look at an activity like this when it
 
00:31:01.490 --> 00:31:01.500 align:start position:0%
comes to say you know enhancing uh
 
00:31:03.529 --> 00:31:03.539 align:start position:0%
poll transfers in a more efficient
 
00:31:04.610 --> 00:31:04.620 align:start position:0%
fashion I don't necessarily think
 
00:31:06.590 --> 00:31:06.600 align:start position:0%
there's like an easy locked Federal
 
00:31:07.850 --> 00:31:07.860 align:start position:0%
funding source for that but there
 
00:31:09.590 --> 00:31:09.600 align:start position:0%
certainly is federal infrastructure
 
00:31:10.850 --> 00:31:10.860 align:start position:0%
money coming down the pike for grid
 
00:31:12.350 --> 00:31:12.360 align:start position:0%
resiliency activities and that type of
 
00:31:13.730 --> 00:31:13.740 align:start position:0%
thing and to Paul's point there
 
00:31:15.830 --> 00:31:15.840 align:start position:0%
certainly is a lot of broadband money
 
00:31:17.450 --> 00:31:17.460 align:start position:0%
coming down and that will require you
 
00:31:18.470 --> 00:31:18.480 align:start position:0%
know obviously the build out of
 
00:31:20.389 --> 00:31:20.399 align:start position:0%
broadband the transfer of polls and
 
00:31:22.789 --> 00:31:22.799 align:start position:0%
attachment attachments and you know that
 
00:31:24.590 --> 00:31:24.600 align:start position:0%
could you know potentially exacerbate
 
00:31:26.090 --> 00:31:26.100 align:start position:0%
the problem that we're that we're seeing
 
00:31:29.029 --> 00:31:29.039 align:start position:0%
so follow-up follow-up and so the
 
00:31:31.850 --> 00:31:31.860 align:start position:0%
follow-up question would be if this
 
00:31:35.149 --> 00:31:35.159 align:start position:0%
um committee can pull together
 
00:31:38.029 --> 00:31:38.039 align:start position:0%
planned activities than perhaps we would
 
00:31:40.430 --> 00:31:40.440 align:start position:0%
be able to be eligible for some money by
 
00:31:41.570 --> 00:31:41.580 align:start position:0%
saying here's what we're trying to do
 
00:31:44.450 --> 00:31:44.460 align:start position:0%
right isn't that often how it works with
 
00:31:46.250 --> 00:31:46.260 align:start position:0%
the federal funding potentially
 
00:31:48.110 --> 00:31:48.120 align:start position:0%
obviously with federal dollars comes
 
00:31:49.310 --> 00:31:49.320 align:start position:0%
Federal strings there are certain
 
00:31:50.930 --> 00:31:50.940 align:start position:0%
activities that are eligible for those
 
00:31:53.090 --> 00:31:53.100 align:start position:0%
types of activities off the top of my
 
00:31:54.950 --> 00:31:54.960 align:start position:0%
head you know there's a formula grant
 
00:31:56.090 --> 00:31:56.100 align:start position:0%
that's given out to States for grid
 
00:31:58.190 --> 00:31:58.200 align:start position:0%
resiliency I don't necessarily think
 
00:32:01.789 --> 00:32:01.799 align:start position:0%
this would be one of those easily
 
00:32:03.169 --> 00:32:03.179 align:start position:0%
defined activities that would be
 
00:32:04.669 --> 00:32:04.679 align:start position:0%
eligible for that funding but to the
 
00:32:06.110 --> 00:32:06.120 align:start position:0%
extent this group is able to identify
 
00:32:08.990 --> 00:32:09.000 align:start position:0%
something and and identify a federal pot
 
00:32:12.110 --> 00:32:12.120 align:start position:0%
yeah okay thank you representative
 
00:32:14.389 --> 00:32:14.399 align:start position:0%
Thomas has a question thank you Mr chair
 
00:32:16.190 --> 00:32:16.200 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question this
 
00:32:17.750 --> 00:32:17.760 align:start position:0%
goes back to the question I asked
 
00:32:20.930 --> 00:32:20.940 align:start position:0%
Senator Waters is um
 
00:32:23.029 --> 00:32:23.039 align:start position:0%
reading the bill here it there doesn't
 
00:32:25.610 --> 00:32:25.620 align:start position:0%
appear to be any direction or provision
 
00:32:28.490 --> 00:32:28.500 align:start position:0%
in there to talk about like what uh
 
00:32:31.250 --> 00:32:31.260 align:start position:0%
representative McGee said cost and money
 
00:32:34.210 --> 00:32:34.220 align:start position:0%
and and so forth
 
00:32:37.490 --> 00:32:37.500 align:start position:0%
is there is it your
 
00:32:37.500 --> 00:32:38.149 align:start position:0%
is there is it your
um

00:32:38.149 --> 00:32:38.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:32:40.070 --> 00:32:40.080 align:start position:0%
impression that maybe something should
 
00:32:42.529 --> 00:32:42.539 align:start position:0%
be added to this to say the group needs
 
00:32:44.510 --> 00:32:44.520 align:start position:0%
to talk about how how things are going
 
00:32:46.730 --> 00:32:46.740 align:start position:0%
to get paid and hopefully not by the
 
00:32:49.070 --> 00:32:49.080 align:start position:0%
ratepayers but if so how and when and so
 
00:32:51.710 --> 00:32:51.720 align:start position:0%
forth and so on
 
00:32:51.720 --> 00:32:52.330 align:start position:0%
forth and so on
um

00:32:52.330 --> 00:32:52.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:32:55.070 --> 00:32:55.080 align:start position:0%
maybe I I think you would probably sure
 
00:32:55.080 --> 00:32:56.090 align:start position:0%
maybe I I think you would probably sure
so

00:32:56.090 --> 00:32:56.100 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:32:58.909 --> 00:32:58.919 align:start position:0%
um regarding the the duties of the
 
00:33:00.769 --> 00:33:00.779 align:start position:0%
commission or stakeholder group I'm
 
00:33:04.730 --> 00:33:04.740 align:start position:0%
sorry lines 19-2 it looks like 28. I
 
00:33:06.529 --> 00:33:06.539 align:start position:0%
would agree there isn't a specific Duty
 
00:33:06.539 --> 00:33:07.370 align:start position:0%
would agree there isn't a specific Duty
there

00:33:07.370 --> 00:33:07.380 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:33:09.169 --> 00:33:09.179 align:start position:0%
um looking at Cost but I think the
 
00:33:11.389 --> 00:33:11.399 align:start position:0%
duties are quite broad already
 
00:33:13.370 --> 00:33:13.380 align:start position:0%
um to maybe Encompass a lot of the
 
00:33:14.810 --> 00:33:14.820 align:start position:0%
different things that go on with these
 
00:33:16.610 --> 00:33:16.620 align:start position:0%
types of poll transfers and that type of
 
00:33:16.620 --> 00:33:18.049 align:start position:0%
types of poll transfers and that type of
activity

00:33:18.049 --> 00:33:18.059 align:start position:0%
activity
 
00:33:20.210 --> 00:33:20.220 align:start position:0%
um and it's certainly I think the
 
00:33:21.649 --> 00:33:21.659 align:start position:0%
Department's view in working with
 
00:33:23.570 --> 00:33:23.580 align:start position:0%
representative Grody and Senator Waters
 
00:33:25.009 --> 00:33:25.019 align:start position:0%
is we want to keep it as flexible as
 
00:33:27.350 --> 00:33:27.360 align:start position:0%
possible to really get the functionality
 
00:33:29.450 --> 00:33:29.460 align:start position:0%
of these types of issues and to make
 
00:33:31.789 --> 00:33:31.799 align:start position:0%
sure Communications are streamlined
 
00:33:33.049 --> 00:33:33.059 align:start position:0%
um it's certainly something we can
 
00:33:34.789 --> 00:33:34.799 align:start position:0%
discuss about maybe putting in a
 
00:33:36.110 --> 00:33:36.120 align:start position:0%
provision about that but I think
 
00:33:38.210 --> 00:33:38.220 align:start position:0%
respectfully we don't feel there is a
 
00:33:39.830 --> 00:33:39.840 align:start position:0%
need for that
 
00:33:41.870 --> 00:33:41.880 align:start position:0%
um given the language
 
00:33:44.950 --> 00:33:44.960 align:start position:0%
follow up yes thank you um
 
00:33:49.250 --> 00:33:49.260 align:start position:0%
I would say yes but uh
 
00:33:51.769 --> 00:33:51.779 align:start position:0%
um could there be something put in there
 
00:33:53.870 --> 00:33:53.880 align:start position:0%
that would say that part of the duties
 
00:33:56.690 --> 00:33:56.700 align:start position:0%
are to part of other Solutions is to
 
00:33:59.870 --> 00:33:59.880 align:start position:0%
minimize any cost to rate payers or
 
00:34:02.630 --> 00:34:02.640 align:start position:0%
anyone else because this seems like a an
 
00:34:05.330 --> 00:34:05.340 align:start position:0%
issue that the utilities should have
 
00:34:08.149 --> 00:34:08.159 align:start position:0%
been working on all as long uh you know
 
00:34:10.070 --> 00:34:10.080 align:start position:0%
like if there's if there's if there's
 
00:34:12.470 --> 00:34:12.480 align:start position:0%
storm damage that cost of course goes
 
00:34:14.750 --> 00:34:14.760 align:start position:0%
into rate payers rates and so forth you
 
00:34:16.129 --> 00:34:16.139 align:start position:0%
know you know things like that but now
 
00:34:19.010 --> 00:34:19.020 align:start position:0%
we're talking about getting new data
 
00:34:22.010 --> 00:34:22.020 align:start position:0%
management system in and the people the
 
00:34:24.530 --> 00:34:24.540 align:start position:0%
utilities may have to pay for new
 
00:34:25.849 --> 00:34:25.859 align:start position:0%
systems and of course they're going to
 
00:34:27.230 --> 00:34:27.240 align:start position:0%
have to recoup that cost somewhere so
 
00:34:29.629 --> 00:34:29.639 align:start position:0%
that's that's why that's why I'm asking
 
00:34:30.710 --> 00:34:30.720 align:start position:0%
the question
 
00:34:32.990 --> 00:34:33.000 align:start position:0%
representative I I guess I just want to
 
00:34:35.389 --> 00:34:35.399 align:start position:0%
bring you back to
 
00:34:39.530 --> 00:34:39.540 align:start position:0%
the I where the utilities do uh have
 
00:34:42.710 --> 00:34:42.720 align:start position:0%
some cost recovery during storms that's
 
00:34:44.149 --> 00:34:44.159 align:start position:0%
not the problem
 
00:34:46.070 --> 00:34:46.080 align:start position:0%
remember I told you the electric
 
00:34:48.409 --> 00:34:48.419 align:start position:0%
companies transfer first
 
00:34:50.810 --> 00:34:50.820 align:start position:0%
they don't have a choice they have to
 
00:34:54.230 --> 00:34:54.240 align:start position:0%
for safety reasons and it's just the
 
00:34:57.050 --> 00:34:57.060 align:start position:0%
nature of it it's everybody else coming
 
00:34:59.210 --> 00:34:59.220 align:start position:0%
down the poll it's those eight to nine
 
00:35:02.810 --> 00:35:02.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:06.290 --> 00:35:06.300 align:start position:0%
um cable TV telephone
 
00:35:08.390 --> 00:35:08.400 align:start position:0%
they have to come along and transfer
 
00:35:11.150 --> 00:35:11.160 align:start position:0%
that's the hold up that's what creates
 
00:35:14.210 --> 00:35:14.220 align:start position:0%
the double pull in the center that I
 
00:35:15.530 --> 00:35:15.540 align:start position:0%
talked about other representative
 
00:35:15.540 --> 00:35:16.730 align:start position:0%
talked about other representative
mentioned

00:35:16.730 --> 00:35:16.740 align:start position:0%
mentioned
 
00:35:19.550 --> 00:35:19.560 align:start position:0%
a small chunk of pole like this
 
00:35:22.910 --> 00:35:22.920 align:start position:0%
hanging we call that chunky Pole
 
00:35:25.190 --> 00:35:25.200 align:start position:0%
because that's a nice way of getting
 
00:35:27.770 --> 00:35:27.780 align:start position:0%
around the transfer right
 
00:35:30.890 --> 00:35:30.900 align:start position:0%
if cut the top off cut the bottom off
 
00:35:33.890 --> 00:35:33.900 align:start position:0%
just lay this piece of
 
00:35:36.890 --> 00:35:36.900 align:start position:0%
say about a three foot piece of the pole
 
00:35:40.310 --> 00:35:40.320 align:start position:0%
left up against the new one
 
00:35:42.589 --> 00:35:42.599 align:start position:0%
that's still a safety issue what happens
 
00:35:44.990 --> 00:35:45.000 align:start position:0%
when it comes off the new pole it's
 
00:35:47.329 --> 00:35:47.339 align:start position:0%
hanging there everything goes down low
 
00:35:47.339 --> 00:35:48.290 align:start position:0%
hanging there everything goes down low
again

00:35:48.290 --> 00:35:48.300 align:start position:0%
again
 
00:35:50.390 --> 00:35:50.400 align:start position:0%
that's not the solution the real
 
00:35:51.770 --> 00:35:51.780 align:start position:0%
solution is
 
00:35:54.050 --> 00:35:54.060 align:start position:0%
all of us getting to the table
 
00:35:56.630 --> 00:35:56.640 align:start position:0%
thinking about how's the best way to fix
 
00:35:59.690 --> 00:35:59.700 align:start position:0%
the problem yeah engines is is one it's
 
00:36:01.670 --> 00:36:01.680 align:start position:0%
part of the solution
 
00:36:05.150 --> 00:36:05.160 align:start position:0%
but the l i my personal opinion the
 
00:36:07.310 --> 00:36:07.320 align:start position:0%
other part of the solution is the
 
00:36:07.320 --> 00:36:08.510 align:start position:0%
other part of the solution is the
commitment

00:36:08.510 --> 00:36:08.520 align:start position:0%
commitment
 
00:36:11.210 --> 00:36:11.220 align:start position:0%
to doing the transfers
 
00:36:14.030 --> 00:36:14.040 align:start position:0%
that's what we just can't keep delaying
 
00:36:17.630 --> 00:36:17.640 align:start position:0%
because again if if it's fine three
 
00:36:19.310 --> 00:36:19.320 align:start position:0%
months six months
 
00:36:21.829 --> 00:36:21.839 align:start position:0%
but once it goes beyond six it gets
 
00:36:24.290 --> 00:36:24.300 align:start position:0%
forgotten and what happens every day
 
00:36:26.750 --> 00:36:26.760 align:start position:0%
there's a new double pole or a triple
 
00:36:30.710 --> 00:36:30.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:34.550 --> 00:36:34.560 align:start position:0%
so did I understand you to say just then
 
00:36:38.390 --> 00:36:38.400 align:start position:0%
that once the transfer is made of all
 
00:36:40.190 --> 00:36:40.200 align:start position:0%
the lines on the pole
 
00:36:41.990 --> 00:36:42.000 align:start position:0%
the poll gets removed in a timely
 
00:36:44.390 --> 00:36:44.400 align:start position:0%
fashion that's correct so it it's
 
00:36:46.849 --> 00:36:46.859 align:start position:0%
removed by the poll owner whether it's
 
00:36:48.290 --> 00:36:48.300 align:start position:0%
the electric company or the telephone
 
00:36:50.510 --> 00:36:50.520 align:start position:0%
company comes back
 
00:36:52.490 --> 00:36:52.500 align:start position:0%
pulls what they call the butt out of the
 
00:36:56.990 --> 00:36:57.000 align:start position:0%
ground fills the hole back in it's done
 
00:37:00.109 --> 00:37:00.119 align:start position:0%
okay great representative munz has a
 
00:37:00.119 --> 00:37:00.950 align:start position:0%
okay great representative munz has a
question

00:37:00.950 --> 00:37:00.960 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:37:03.170 --> 00:37:03.180 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
00:37:05.329 --> 00:37:05.339 align:start position:0%
coming in and talk to us today
 
00:37:08.150 --> 00:37:08.160 align:start position:0%
um you you you just mentioned that you
 
00:37:10.670 --> 00:37:10.680 align:start position:0%
know what's missing is the commitment
 
00:37:12.890 --> 00:37:12.900 align:start position:0%
to actually do the work that needs to be
 
00:37:17.870 --> 00:37:17.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:20.150 --> 00:37:20.160 align:start position:0%
it's if I I believe bringing everybody
 
00:37:24.710 --> 00:37:24.720 align:start position:0%
to the table and not it's not in a
 
00:37:27.170 --> 00:37:27.180 align:start position:0%
punitive sense sir but to bring
 
00:37:28.910 --> 00:37:28.920 align:start position:0%
everybody to tables they'll all
 
00:37:31.430 --> 00:37:31.440 align:start position:0%
everybody admits it's a problem because
 
00:37:32.990 --> 00:37:33.000 align:start position:0%
we're not the only ones getting the
 
00:37:35.390 --> 00:37:35.400 align:start position:0%
complaint the electric utilities get
 
00:37:38.210 --> 00:37:38.220 align:start position:0%
complaint the telecoms do the fiber
 
00:37:41.030 --> 00:37:41.040 align:start position:0%
companies do I was in the industry for a
 
00:37:43.069 --> 00:37:43.079 align:start position:0%
long time and I managed a service center
 
00:37:46.010 --> 00:37:46.020 align:start position:0%
one of one of the towns that I had under
 
00:37:48.470 --> 00:37:48.480 align:start position:0%
my jurisdiction the road agent refused
 
00:37:50.089 --> 00:37:50.099 align:start position:0%
to allow me to set a poll again until
 
00:37:52.849 --> 00:37:52.859 align:start position:0%
all the double poles were gone
 
00:37:54.890 --> 00:37:54.900 align:start position:0%
it's like
 
00:37:58.849 --> 00:37:58.859 align:start position:0%
this is how bad it got it it hasn't
 
00:38:01.010 --> 00:38:01.020 align:start position:0%
changed in representative Grody could
 
00:38:04.069 --> 00:38:04.079 align:start position:0%
I'm sure just other Representatives we
 
00:38:06.109 --> 00:38:06.119 align:start position:0%
had the representative from Exeter
 
00:38:08.810 --> 00:38:08.820 align:start position:0%
testified in and that was one of the
 
00:38:11.390 --> 00:38:11.400 align:start position:0%
complaints from her constituents all
 
00:38:13.430 --> 00:38:13.440 align:start position:0%
these double polls in Exeter
 
00:38:16.310 --> 00:38:16.320 align:start position:0%
follow-up follow-up
 
00:38:19.910 --> 00:38:19.920 align:start position:0%
I I understand and I I know of one
 
00:38:23.150 --> 00:38:23.160 align:start position:0%
situation of a chunky pole in in my town
 
00:38:25.670 --> 00:38:25.680 align:start position:0%
um and it's starting to hang
 
00:38:27.050 --> 00:38:27.060 align:start position:0%
um but
 
00:38:27.060 --> 00:38:28.550 align:start position:0%
um but
um

00:38:28.550 --> 00:38:28.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:31.190 --> 00:38:31.200 align:start position:0%
I guess what I'm struggling with is you
 
00:38:32.930 --> 00:38:32.940 align:start position:0%
know this is there's nothing that's
 
00:38:35.569 --> 00:38:35.579 align:start position:0%
going to compel these members to come to
 
00:38:37.790 --> 00:38:37.800 align:start position:0%
this meeting
 
00:38:38.990 --> 00:38:39.000 align:start position:0%
um and there's nothing that's going to
 
00:38:41.270 --> 00:38:41.280 align:start position:0%
compel any action
 
00:38:44.030 --> 00:38:44.040 align:start position:0%
and so I'm trying to understand what
 
00:38:47.210 --> 00:38:47.220 align:start position:0%
what will be what's different after we
 
00:38:48.890 --> 00:38:48.900 align:start position:0%
implement this stakeholder group than
 
00:38:50.450 --> 00:38:50.460 align:start position:0%
what could be happening right now I mean
 
00:38:53.089 --> 00:38:53.099 align:start position:0%
there's no reason why these entities
 
00:38:55.190 --> 00:38:55.200 align:start position:0%
couldn't be pulled together now I
 
00:38:57.290 --> 00:38:57.300 align:start position:0%
they're clearly not doing it I guess
 
00:39:00.109 --> 00:39:00.119 align:start position:0%
from my understanding the report that I
 
00:39:03.230 --> 00:39:03.240 align:start position:0%
will have to present to all of you
 
00:39:06.349 --> 00:39:06.359 align:start position:0%
I guess believe that December November
 
00:39:08.089 --> 00:39:08.099 align:start position:0%
November 1
 
00:39:10.490 --> 00:39:10.500 align:start position:0%
um would be the finding saying there was
 
00:39:12.349 --> 00:39:12.359 align:start position:0%
participation there wasn't any
 
00:39:15.650 --> 00:39:15.660 align:start position:0%
participation there was no but he really
 
00:39:17.690 --> 00:39:17.700 align:start position:0%
actively involved wanting to find a
 
00:39:20.150 --> 00:39:20.160 align:start position:0%
solution that could be my conclusion
 
00:39:22.609 --> 00:39:22.619 align:start position:0%
that's one of them and hopefully I'd
 
00:39:24.050 --> 00:39:24.060 align:start position:0%
rather be able to write you a report
 
00:39:28.250 --> 00:39:28.260 align:start position:0%
that says we've we found this with these
 
00:39:29.810 --> 00:39:29.820 align:start position:0%
are the steps that we're taking to
 
00:39:33.010 --> 00:39:33.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:35.630 --> 00:39:35.640 align:start position:0%
again and these are this is just my
 
00:39:39.050 --> 00:39:39.060 align:start position:0%
opinion sir it it's gonna take
 
00:39:39.060 --> 00:39:40.430 align:start position:0%
opinion sir it it's gonna take
Collective

00:39:40.430 --> 00:39:40.440 align:start position:0%
Collective
 
00:39:43.910 --> 00:39:43.920 align:start position:0%
getting together and and think everybody
 
00:39:46.130 --> 00:39:46.140 align:start position:0%
coming up with a solution what's the
 
00:39:49.970 --> 00:39:49.980 align:start position:0%
best idea how can we better transfer in
 
00:39:52.130 --> 00:39:52.140 align:start position:0%
a more efficient manner than we are
 
00:39:52.140 --> 00:39:54.050 align:start position:0%
a more efficient manner than we are
currently

00:39:54.050 --> 00:39:54.060 align:start position:0%
currently
 
00:39:56.690 --> 00:39:56.700 align:start position:0%
representative Bernardi has a question
 
00:39:59.510 --> 00:39:59.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman so if
 
00:40:01.670 --> 00:40:01.680 align:start position:0%
correct me if I'm wrong on this my
 
00:40:04.849 --> 00:40:04.859 align:start position:0%
understanding is electrical transfers
 
00:40:07.670 --> 00:40:07.680 align:start position:0%
first and then all the various Cable
 
00:40:11.089 --> 00:40:11.099 align:start position:0%
telephone fire department wires whatever
 
00:40:14.089 --> 00:40:14.099 align:start position:0%
it is have to be transferred and each
 
00:40:17.270 --> 00:40:17.280 align:start position:0%
entity that owns them has to do it one
 
00:40:21.950 --> 00:40:21.960 align:start position:0%
by one is there an opportunity for a
 
00:40:26.770 --> 00:40:26.780 align:start position:0%
third party to transfer all of the
 
00:40:30.310 --> 00:40:30.320 align:start position:0%
non-electrical wires in some kind of
 
00:40:34.069 --> 00:40:34.079 align:start position:0%
One-Stop move is that a possibility or
 
00:40:36.230 --> 00:40:36.240 align:start position:0%
is or do we have legislation that needs
 
00:40:39.710 --> 00:40:39.720 align:start position:0%
to be changed to permit that
 
00:40:43.130 --> 00:40:43.140 align:start position:0%
I it it is a possibility it would be an
 
00:40:45.470 --> 00:40:45.480 align:start position:0%
agreement under all of the let's call
 
00:40:47.930 --> 00:40:47.940 align:start position:0%
them all the Telecommunications group
 
00:40:51.230 --> 00:40:51.240 align:start position:0%
that's how the state of Washington as I
 
00:40:53.270 --> 00:40:53.280 align:start position:0%
stated earlier my counterpart there
 
00:40:55.849 --> 00:40:55.859 align:start position:0%
that's how they address the problem they
 
00:40:57.710 --> 00:40:57.720 align:start position:0%
got all the utilities in and they got
 
00:41:00.410 --> 00:41:00.420 align:start position:0%
the telecoms to agree there's a one
 
00:41:02.569 --> 00:41:02.579 align:start position:0%
single contract I want a third party
 
00:41:05.810 --> 00:41:05.820 align:start position:0%
comes along transfers all the Telecom
 
00:41:05.820 --> 00:41:07.069 align:start position:0%
comes along transfers all the Telecom
stuff

00:41:07.069 --> 00:41:07.079 align:start position:0%
stuff
 
00:41:10.010 --> 00:41:10.020 align:start position:0%
bills them all equally for whatever the
 
00:41:12.410 --> 00:41:12.420 align:start position:0%
total cost was and in their particular
 
00:41:15.650 --> 00:41:15.660 align:start position:0%
case this third-party contractor once he
 
00:41:17.750 --> 00:41:17.760 align:start position:0%
has everything transferred he actually
 
00:41:19.730 --> 00:41:19.740 align:start position:0%
removes the old poll takes it away
 
00:41:21.890 --> 00:41:21.900 align:start position:0%
because little polls of hazardous waste
 
00:41:23.870 --> 00:41:23.880 align:start position:0%
there's a cost to that
 
00:41:27.829 --> 00:41:27.839 align:start position:0%
so maybe we can find some common ground
 
00:41:31.069 --> 00:41:31.079 align:start position:0%
there with everybody in New Hampshire
 
00:41:32.349 --> 00:41:32.359 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:41:34.970 --> 00:41:34.980 align:start position:0%
representative Nutter has a question
 
00:41:37.609 --> 00:41:37.619 align:start position:0%
thank you I run by one of those hanging
 
00:41:39.829 --> 00:41:39.839 align:start position:0%
um pieces chunky poles yeah that's I was
 
00:41:41.510 --> 00:41:41.520 align:start position:0%
going to ask you what they're called I
 
00:41:43.849 --> 00:41:43.859 align:start position:0%
was going to tell my neighbor I thought
 
00:41:45.470 --> 00:41:45.480 align:start position:0%
you said chunky monkey but you call them
 
00:41:47.230 --> 00:41:47.240 align:start position:0%
chunky poles
 
00:41:50.089 --> 00:41:50.099 align:start position:0%
in the industry the line workers call it
 
00:41:52.069 --> 00:41:52.079 align:start position:0%
chunky pull when they cut off the bottom
 
00:41:53.870 --> 00:41:53.880 align:start position:0%
and the top and they leave just a
 
00:41:56.690 --> 00:41:56.700 align:start position:0%
section of it follow-up follow-up
 
00:41:56.700 --> 00:41:57.770 align:start position:0%
section of it follow-up follow-up
comment

00:41:57.770 --> 00:41:57.780 align:start position:0%
comment
 
00:41:59.510 --> 00:41:59.520 align:start position:0%
um it's been there since the ice storm
 
00:42:02.810 --> 00:42:02.820 align:start position:0%
of 2008 the Canadians did this one
 
00:42:02.820 --> 00:42:04.910 align:start position:0%
of 2008 the Canadians did this one
again

00:42:04.910 --> 00:42:04.920 align:start position:0%
again
 
00:42:07.069 --> 00:42:07.079 align:start position:0%
the Canadians came down and and helped
 
00:42:08.750 --> 00:42:08.760 align:start position:0%
with the ice storm
 
00:42:10.970 --> 00:42:10.980 align:start position:0%
um to reconnect all the power
 
00:42:10.980 --> 00:42:11.990 align:start position:0%
um to reconnect all the power
so

00:42:11.990 --> 00:42:12.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:42:14.630 --> 00:42:14.640 align:start position:0%
representative pojo has a question
 
00:42:17.630 --> 00:42:17.640 align:start position:0%
oh thank you chair and thank you Mr
 
00:42:21.609 --> 00:42:21.619 align:start position:0%
Casper and uh Mr low Birch
 
00:42:24.950 --> 00:42:24.960 align:start position:0%
Porter record I'm going to segue off
 
00:42:27.349 --> 00:42:27.359 align:start position:0%
with this question our fellow
 
00:42:28.730 --> 00:42:28.740 align:start position:0%
representatives in here committee
 
00:42:32.870 --> 00:42:32.880 align:start position:0%
members that in section four
 
00:42:32.880 --> 00:42:34.310 align:start position:0%
members that in section four
could

00:42:34.310 --> 00:42:34.320 align:start position:0%
could
 
00:42:36.950 --> 00:42:36.960 align:start position:0%
would the department of energy and
 
00:42:36.960 --> 00:42:38.470 align:start position:0%
would the department of energy and
compliance

00:42:38.470 --> 00:42:38.480 align:start position:0%
compliance
 
00:42:38.480 --> 00:42:40.190 align:start position:0%
compliance
consider

00:42:40.190 --> 00:42:40.200 align:start position:0%
consider
 
00:42:43.130 --> 00:42:43.140 align:start position:0%
coming back and report if there is Need
 
00:42:45.829 --> 00:42:45.839 align:start position:0%
for legislation for compliance since we
 
00:42:48.349 --> 00:42:48.359 align:start position:0%
know how committees sometimes work
 
00:42:51.670 --> 00:42:51.680 align:start position:0%
I'm against it but in certain States
 
00:42:54.710 --> 00:42:54.720 align:start position:0%
instances so would it that would be a
 
00:42:56.810 --> 00:42:56.820 align:start position:0%
response thank you thank you
 
00:42:59.809 --> 00:42:59.819 align:start position:0%
representative so I think I think the
 
00:43:01.250 --> 00:43:01.260 align:start position:0%
way I think we took the reporting
 
00:43:02.690 --> 00:43:02.700 align:start position:0%
requirement is that if there was
 
00:43:05.630 --> 00:43:05.640 align:start position:0%
agreement amongst the different groups
 
00:43:07.250 --> 00:43:07.260 align:start position:0%
um for the need for legislation to move
 
00:43:08.630 --> 00:43:08.640 align:start position:0%
forward on an agreement or something
 
00:43:10.490 --> 00:43:10.500 align:start position:0%
like that then that would likely be
 
00:43:12.890 --> 00:43:12.900 align:start position:0%
included in in a report that's issued to
 
00:43:16.430 --> 00:43:16.440 align:start position:0%
the to the oh my God the legislature I'm
 
00:43:16.440 --> 00:43:17.510 align:start position:0%
the to the oh my God the legislature I'm
sorry

00:43:17.510 --> 00:43:17.520 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
00:43:20.210 --> 00:43:20.220 align:start position:0%
um uh yeah so I imagine that in there I
 
00:43:21.829 --> 00:43:21.839 align:start position:0%
think you know in these reports
 
00:43:23.390 --> 00:43:23.400 align:start position:0%
legislative recommendations would be
 
00:43:24.950 --> 00:43:24.960 align:start position:0%
made but I think they'd likely be made
 
00:43:26.990 --> 00:43:27.000 align:start position:0%
only when there's a consensus among the
 
00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:29.230 align:start position:0%
only when there's a consensus among the
group

00:43:29.230 --> 00:43:29.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:31.250 --> 00:43:31.260 align:start position:0%
representative Corman has a question
 
00:43:32.870 --> 00:43:32.880 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
00:43:34.430 --> 00:43:34.440 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:43:37.490 --> 00:43:37.500 align:start position:0%
um Mr Casper I think you said that uh it
 
00:43:39.230 --> 00:43:39.240 align:start position:0%
takes time to get a license to join
 
00:43:40.670 --> 00:43:40.680 align:start position:0%
engines and I think you said something
 
00:43:43.490 --> 00:43:43.500 align:start position:0%
about three months yeah uh can can you
 
00:43:45.829 --> 00:43:45.839 align:start position:0%
elaborate on that a little bit please
 
00:43:49.790 --> 00:43:49.800 align:start position:0%
well because I'm not a utility and I uh
 
00:43:53.510 --> 00:43:53.520 align:start position:0%
submitted to have a license to use the
 
00:43:55.790 --> 00:43:55.800 align:start position:0%
software so that we could look in the
 
00:43:58.190 --> 00:43:58.200 align:start position:0%
database and get a better handle on the
 
00:44:01.309 --> 00:44:01.319 align:start position:0%
numbers of double polls uh I submitted
 
00:44:04.550 --> 00:44:04.560 align:start position:0%
my application to uh engines and one of
 
00:44:06.050 --> 00:44:06.060 align:start position:0%
the requirements is they have to reach
 
00:44:08.950 --> 00:44:08.960 align:start position:0%
out to all the utilities within
 
00:44:11.690 --> 00:44:11.700 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire that a pot of
 
00:44:13.370 --> 00:44:13.380 align:start position:0%
engines and get an agreement from them
 
00:44:16.130 --> 00:44:16.140 align:start position:0%
that that would be okay with them
 
00:44:17.930 --> 00:44:17.940 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
00:44:20.690 --> 00:44:20.700 align:start position:0%
so I'm sure it'll come
 
00:44:23.569 --> 00:44:23.579 align:start position:0%
eventually but
 
00:44:23.579 --> 00:44:24.109 align:start position:0%
eventually but
um

00:44:24.109 --> 00:44:24.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:26.809 --> 00:44:26.819 align:start position:0%
it would be make it easier for for my
 
00:44:29.030 --> 00:44:29.040 align:start position:0%
department uh as we move if we move
 
00:44:31.790 --> 00:44:31.800 align:start position:0%
forward with this committee uh to commit
 
00:44:35.089 --> 00:44:35.099 align:start position:0%
the resources that we have myself and my
 
00:44:37.069 --> 00:44:37.079 align:start position:0%
electrical inspector to work with the
 
00:44:39.829 --> 00:44:39.839 align:start position:0%
utilities to find a solution follow up
 
00:44:41.690 --> 00:44:41.700 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
00:44:44.690 --> 00:44:44.700 align:start position:0%
so who who controls engines who who is
 
00:44:46.309 --> 00:44:46.319 align:start position:0%
it that's saying you know you're not
 
00:44:47.750 --> 00:44:47.760 align:start position:0%
you're not good enough because you're
 
00:44:50.150 --> 00:44:50.160 align:start position:0%
not utility at your government
 
00:44:52.910 --> 00:44:52.920 align:start position:0%
I I guess
 
00:44:58.550 --> 00:44:58.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:58.560 --> 00:45:01.329 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:45:01.329 --> 00:45:01.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:04.970 --> 00:45:04.980 align:start position:0%
company that created engines for all the
 
00:45:08.030 --> 00:45:08.040 align:start position:0%
utilities to be a part of that it was
 
00:45:10.550 --> 00:45:10.560 align:start position:0%
strictly designed and paid for by
 
00:45:10.560 --> 00:45:13.970 align:start position:0%
strictly designed and paid for by
utilities

00:45:13.970 --> 00:45:13.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:17.510 --> 00:45:17.520 align:start position:0%
representative partial has a question
 
00:45:19.010 --> 00:45:19.020 align:start position:0%
thank you chair and thank you for being
 
00:45:20.990 --> 00:45:21.000 align:start position:0%
here today uh you mentioned earlier
 
00:45:22.970 --> 00:45:22.980 align:start position:0%
Washington State and I might be
 
00:45:24.829 --> 00:45:24.839 align:start position:0%
incorrecting the terminology One Touch
 
00:45:25.970 --> 00:45:25.980 align:start position:0%
make ready
 
00:45:28.130 --> 00:45:28.140 align:start position:0%
now are other states considering that as
 
00:45:30.410 --> 00:45:30.420 align:start position:0%
a solution are you aware of that as well
 
00:45:32.390 --> 00:45:32.400 align:start position:0%
well I
 
00:45:35.150 --> 00:45:35.160 align:start position:0%
just probably said in our conversations
 
00:45:37.910 --> 00:45:37.920 align:start position:0%
every a lot of the other states similar
 
00:45:40.130 --> 00:45:40.140 align:start position:0%
situation that we're in they all thought
 
00:45:42.230 --> 00:45:42.240 align:start position:0%
that boy that's unique maybe you know
 
00:45:44.390 --> 00:45:44.400 align:start position:0%
they we're all going to start to look
 
00:45:47.390 --> 00:45:47.400 align:start position:0%
into doing that in and again as you can
 
00:45:50.870 --> 00:45:50.880 align:start position:0%
tell this the the process does take a
 
00:45:52.609 --> 00:45:52.619 align:start position:0%
little bit and everybody's in we're all
 
00:45:55.010 --> 00:45:55.020 align:start position:0%
in the same boat moving these things
 
00:45:58.970 --> 00:45:58.980 align:start position:0%
forward and so I I know my counterpart
 
00:46:01.670 --> 00:46:01.680 align:start position:0%
in Pennsylvania yes I I talked to him
 
00:46:04.370 --> 00:46:04.380 align:start position:0%
more often than anybody and they're
 
00:46:08.349 --> 00:46:08.359 align:start position:0%
pushing it in a similar way as we did
 
00:46:11.329 --> 00:46:11.339 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington follow-up
 
00:46:13.849 --> 00:46:13.859 align:start position:0%
sorry thank you so much chair
 
00:46:16.130 --> 00:46:16.140 align:start position:0%
um my constituents are really crying and
 
00:46:17.270 --> 00:46:17.280 align:start position:0%
then and that's what I'm hearing this
 
00:46:19.790 --> 00:46:19.800 align:start position:0%
from my constituents um and I'm looking
 
00:46:22.190 --> 00:46:22.200 align:start position:0%
at the uh deadline for a report being
 
00:46:25.130 --> 00:46:25.140 align:start position:0%
November 1st I know that the utilities
 
00:46:26.390 --> 00:46:26.400 align:start position:0%
are very good about getting out there
 
00:46:28.430 --> 00:46:28.440 align:start position:0%
once I identify a problem
 
00:46:30.530 --> 00:46:30.540 align:start position:0%
for the most part
 
00:46:33.050 --> 00:46:33.060 align:start position:0%
um is there any way I could ally some of
 
00:46:34.609 --> 00:46:34.619 align:start position:0%
the concerns of my constituents by
 
00:46:37.430 --> 00:46:37.440 align:start position:0%
letting them know that
 
00:46:40.010 --> 00:46:40.020 align:start position:0%
while this is looking to be an ongoing
 
00:46:42.170 --> 00:46:42.180 align:start position:0%
without a sunset Clause
 
00:46:42.180 --> 00:46:42.890 align:start position:0%
without a sunset Clause
um

00:46:42.890 --> 00:46:42.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:45.530 --> 00:46:45.540 align:start position:0%
committee at the end of it all they will
 
00:46:52.750 --> 00:46:52.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:55.550 --> 00:46:55.560 align:start position:0%
that is certainly the goal um but
 
00:46:57.109 --> 00:46:57.119 align:start position:0%
obviously nobody can predict the future
 
00:46:58.790 --> 00:46:58.800 align:start position:0%
you know I can't predict who shows up to
 
00:47:00.109 --> 00:47:00.119 align:start position:0%
these meetings or not but that is
 
00:47:01.730 --> 00:47:01.740 align:start position:0%
certainly the intent
 
00:47:04.130 --> 00:47:04.140 align:start position:0%
um regarding I guess a Sunset date or
 
00:47:05.450 --> 00:47:05.460 align:start position:0%
anything like that I don't think the
 
00:47:07.130 --> 00:47:07.140 align:start position:0%
department felt a Sunset date was needed
 
00:47:07.140 --> 00:47:08.390 align:start position:0%
department felt a Sunset date was needed
because

00:47:08.390 --> 00:47:08.400 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:47:10.550 --> 00:47:10.560 align:start position:0%
um in the language of this bill the
 
00:47:12.410 --> 00:47:12.420 align:start position:0%
stakeholder groups are called at the
 
00:47:15.290 --> 00:47:15.300 align:start position:0%
discretion of Paul over here so if there
 
00:47:17.030 --> 00:47:17.040 align:start position:0%
is say an agreement to move forward with
 
00:47:18.589 --> 00:47:18.599 align:start position:0%
say legislation or maybe there's a
 
00:47:20.630 --> 00:47:20.640 align:start position:0%
non-legislative fix
 
00:47:23.030 --> 00:47:23.040 align:start position:0%
um you know we can have that agreement
 
00:47:24.950 --> 00:47:24.960 align:start position:0%
and if need be we can come in later on
 
00:47:26.329 --> 00:47:26.339 align:start position:0%
and say we don't need the stakeholder
 
00:47:28.010 --> 00:47:28.020 align:start position:0%
group anymore in statute we can take it
 
00:47:29.750 --> 00:47:29.760 align:start position:0%
away but I think we want to have that
 
00:47:31.670 --> 00:47:31.680 align:start position:0%
flexibility discretion to call these
 
00:47:33.170 --> 00:47:33.180 align:start position:0%
meetings because as Paul mentioned this
 
00:47:34.609 --> 00:47:34.619 align:start position:0%
is something we'll that will likely take
 
00:47:36.650 --> 00:47:36.660 align:start position:0%
quite a bit of time
 
00:47:38.569 --> 00:47:38.579 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington has a question
 
00:47:39.890 --> 00:47:39.900 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
00:47:41.510 --> 00:47:41.520 align:start position:0%
my question uh let me just say ditto
 
00:47:43.609 --> 00:47:43.619 align:start position:0%
what my colleague just said I made the
 
00:47:45.109 --> 00:47:45.119 align:start position:0%
mistake of taking my wife to the dump
 
00:47:46.849 --> 00:47:46.859 align:start position:0%
the other day not to drop her off but
 
00:47:48.890 --> 00:47:48.900 align:start position:0%
she just was in the car with me and we
 
00:47:50.750 --> 00:47:50.760 align:start position:0%
happened to drive by the pole that's
 
00:47:52.849 --> 00:47:52.859 align:start position:0%
been hanging there for about a month and
 
00:47:53.930 --> 00:47:53.940 align:start position:0%
she said why don't you do something
 
00:47:58.069 --> 00:47:58.079 align:start position:0%
about that so anyways uh a couple of
 
00:48:00.829 --> 00:48:00.839 align:start position:0%
questions uh first one would be
 
00:48:02.750 --> 00:48:02.760 align:start position:0%
says that the stakeholders group shall
 
00:48:04.550 --> 00:48:04.560 align:start position:0%
consist of then it lists a whole mess of
 
00:48:07.069 --> 00:48:07.079 align:start position:0%
people it doesn't list anyone from doe
 
00:48:08.750 --> 00:48:08.760 align:start position:0%
but it does say the director of the
 
00:48:10.849 --> 00:48:10.859 align:start position:0%
division of enforcement will be it'll be
 
00:48:12.890 --> 00:48:12.900 align:start position:0%
under them is it necessary to list them
 
00:48:15.109 --> 00:48:15.119 align:start position:0%
as a member as well just so we don't
 
00:48:17.150 --> 00:48:17.160 align:start position:0%
have a well you know that's a grift
 
00:48:20.210 --> 00:48:20.220 align:start position:0%
question I guess uh thank you um I don't
 
00:48:22.190 --> 00:48:22.200 align:start position:0%
necessarily think that's required I
 
00:48:23.930 --> 00:48:23.940 align:start position:0%
imagine because these meetings are
 
00:48:25.309 --> 00:48:25.319 align:start position:0%
called at the discretion of Paul over
 
00:48:26.510 --> 00:48:26.520 align:start position:0%
here I don't imagine he'll just say
 
00:48:27.890 --> 00:48:27.900 align:start position:0%
everybody come to the department meet in
 
00:48:28.910 --> 00:48:28.920 align:start position:0%
this room and he's just going to be up
 
00:48:30.470 --> 00:48:30.480 align:start position:0%
in his office
 
00:48:32.329 --> 00:48:32.339 align:start position:0%
um he'll I'm sure he'll be actively
 
00:48:34.250 --> 00:48:34.260 align:start position:0%
involved for sure
 
00:48:35.750 --> 00:48:35.760 align:start position:0%
um and just to reiterate I know there's
 
00:48:37.250 --> 00:48:37.260 align:start position:0%
some question on the membership of this
 
00:48:39.230 --> 00:48:39.240 align:start position:0%
stakeholder group it largely emulates
 
00:48:41.809 --> 00:48:41.819 align:start position:0%
the uh commission makeup from the study
 
00:48:43.490 --> 00:48:43.500 align:start position:0%
commission that met uh last year thank
 
00:48:47.030 --> 00:48:47.040 align:start position:0%
you follow up follow up yeah uh you
 
00:48:48.890 --> 00:48:48.900 align:start position:0%
mentioned this is a multi-state issue
 
00:48:50.390 --> 00:48:50.400 align:start position:0%
and I think it's a national issue
 
00:48:52.490 --> 00:48:52.500 align:start position:0%
everybody I've talked to over the last
 
00:48:54.530 --> 00:48:54.540 align:start position:0%
15 years when you bring up the subject
 
00:48:56.809 --> 00:48:56.819 align:start position:0%
over they just go ah we have no solution
 
00:48:59.150 --> 00:48:59.160 align:start position:0%
have you pursued going through some
 
00:49:01.670 --> 00:49:01.680 align:start position:0%
organization like Nesco because some of
 
00:49:03.650 --> 00:49:03.660 align:start position:0%
these utilities are obviously in
 
00:49:05.030 --> 00:49:05.040 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts New Hampshire and
 
00:49:07.250 --> 00:49:07.260 align:start position:0%
Connecticut and maybe coming up with a
 
00:49:09.230 --> 00:49:09.240 align:start position:0%
regional approach uh through an
 
00:49:10.970 --> 00:49:10.980 align:start position:0%
organization such as well either Nesco
 
00:49:13.430 --> 00:49:13.440 align:start position:0%
or neck puck or something like that
 
00:49:13.440 --> 00:49:15.290 align:start position:0%
or neck puck or something like that
that

00:49:15.290 --> 00:49:15.300 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:49:17.390 --> 00:49:17.400 align:start position:0%
that's a good question is it that's a
 
00:49:19.190 --> 00:49:19.200 align:start position:0%
good possibility especially we're
 
00:49:22.190 --> 00:49:22.200 align:start position:0%
working through uh eversource where
 
00:49:24.829 --> 00:49:24.839 align:start position:0%
they're in three states
 
00:49:24.839 --> 00:49:25.910 align:start position:0%
they're in three states
um

00:49:25.910 --> 00:49:25.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:49:28.990 --> 00:49:29.000 align:start position:0%
I I I guess
 
00:49:32.930 --> 00:49:32.940 align:start position:0%
just to start this process just to get
 
00:49:35.270 --> 00:49:35.280 align:start position:0%
you know to kick start it and get a feel
 
00:49:38.750 --> 00:49:38.760 align:start position:0%
or just to get a better idea where
 
00:49:40.910 --> 00:49:40.920 align:start position:0%
everybody is coming from
 
00:49:43.670 --> 00:49:43.680 align:start position:0%
kind of collectively ask or get them for
 
00:49:47.569 --> 00:49:47.579 align:start position:0%
each individual group say what do you
 
00:49:49.849 --> 00:49:49.859 align:start position:0%
see the issue being
 
00:49:52.190 --> 00:49:52.200 align:start position:0%
okay I just yeah I'm assuming that the
 
00:49:53.990 --> 00:49:54.000 align:start position:0%
the eversource is going to have the same
 
00:49:56.630 --> 00:49:56.640 align:start position:0%
issues in Connecticut all states are
 
00:49:58.730 --> 00:49:58.740 align:start position:0%
working on this sir okay uh
 
00:50:01.730 --> 00:50:01.740 align:start position:0%
representative thank you it's it's just
 
00:50:06.710 --> 00:50:06.720 align:start position:0%
how it's not an easy thing to solve it's
 
00:50:08.809 --> 00:50:08.819 align:start position:0%
not and uh
 
00:50:10.690 --> 00:50:10.700 align:start position:0%
hopefully we can
 
00:50:14.210 --> 00:50:14.220 align:start position:0%
create a collaborative environment to
 
00:50:15.650 --> 00:50:15.660 align:start position:0%
get it done
 
00:50:18.470 --> 00:50:18.480 align:start position:0%
okay great thank you very much
 
00:50:20.569 --> 00:50:20.579 align:start position:0%
representative Noel has another question
 
00:50:23.329 --> 00:50:23.339 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
00:50:26.510 --> 00:50:26.520 align:start position:0%
thinking of it the the the problem from
 
00:50:28.130 --> 00:50:28.140 align:start position:0%
the utilities point of view is there a
 
00:50:30.650 --> 00:50:30.660 align:start position:0%
scarcity issue in in getting the
 
00:50:32.329 --> 00:50:32.339 align:start position:0%
attachments and having the polls
 
00:50:36.170 --> 00:50:36.180 align:start position:0%
available uh ready and uh able to be put
 
00:50:38.990 --> 00:50:39.000 align:start position:0%
in uh in time is that is that part of
 
00:50:40.849 --> 00:50:40.859 align:start position:0%
the issue
 
00:50:43.970 --> 00:50:43.980 align:start position:0%
I I it is positive issue not so much in
 
00:50:46.250 --> 00:50:46.260 align:start position:0%
the supply chain side I don't believe
 
00:50:50.270 --> 00:50:50.280 align:start position:0%
but in in uh the employ employee
 
00:50:55.069 --> 00:50:55.079 align:start position:0%
resource resources it say on to go out
 
00:50:58.069 --> 00:50:58.079 align:start position:0%
and transfer on a set a new poll and
 
00:50:59.990 --> 00:51:00.000 align:start position:0%
transfer everything that's probably
 
00:51:02.930 --> 00:51:02.940 align:start position:0%
could be anywhere from an 8 to 12 hour
 
00:51:05.990 --> 00:51:06.000 align:start position:0%
14 day start to finish so just quite a
 
00:51:08.450 --> 00:51:08.460 align:start position:0%
bit of work involved with that
 
00:51:12.010 --> 00:51:12.020 align:start position:0%
um I I think it's just each
 
00:51:14.569 --> 00:51:14.579 align:start position:0%
and again
 
00:51:17.329 --> 00:51:17.339 align:start position:0%
the transfer of the next one Downs
 
00:51:19.490 --> 00:51:19.500 align:start position:0%
relatively simple
 
00:51:21.770 --> 00:51:21.780 align:start position:0%
it's you're on the next wire down from
 
00:51:24.109 --> 00:51:24.119 align:start position:0%
the electric you're just transferring
 
00:51:28.010 --> 00:51:28.020 align:start position:0%
excuse me your wire from the old damage
 
00:51:30.049 --> 00:51:30.059 align:start position:0%
poll to the new one make the attachment
 
00:51:32.150 --> 00:51:32.160 align:start position:0%
you're done
 
00:51:34.609 --> 00:51:34.619 align:start position:0%
in the next one comes along and usually
 
00:51:36.589 --> 00:51:36.599 align:start position:0%
what happens is the next one down when
 
00:51:38.630 --> 00:51:38.640 align:start position:0%
they after they've attacked they cut the
 
00:51:40.609 --> 00:51:40.619 align:start position:0%
pole take that section off so the next
 
00:51:46.010 --> 00:51:46.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:48.530 --> 00:51:48.540 align:start position:0%
okay representative Reynolds has a
 
00:51:48.540 --> 00:51:50.690 align:start position:0%
okay representative Reynolds has a
question

00:51:50.690 --> 00:51:50.700 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:51:53.630 --> 00:51:53.640 align:start position:0%
it's less of a question Mr chairman than
 
00:51:55.670 --> 00:51:55.680 align:start position:0%
a comment I guess I
 
00:51:57.829 --> 00:51:57.839 align:start position:0%
okay if it's a comment could you reserve
 
00:51:59.930 --> 00:51:59.940 align:start position:0%
that to the executive session
 
00:52:02.030 --> 00:52:02.040 align:start position:0%
public hearings are for obtaining
 
00:52:05.510 --> 00:52:05.520 align:start position:0%
information from the public yeah so we
 
00:52:07.790 --> 00:52:07.800 align:start position:0%
want to restrict our activity here this
 
00:52:09.589 --> 00:52:09.599 align:start position:0%
morning let me ask you a question let me
 
00:52:12.290 --> 00:52:12.300 align:start position:0%
make it a question then I I guess
 
00:52:16.549 --> 00:52:16.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:19.250 --> 00:52:19.260 align:start position:0%
is it I'm frustrated to hear you say
 
00:52:22.849 --> 00:52:22.859 align:start position:0%
it's not an easy problem to solve in
 
00:52:27.049 --> 00:52:27.059 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:29.750 --> 00:52:29.760 align:start position:0%
given us an example where a state and
 
00:52:31.790 --> 00:52:31.800 align:start position:0%
maybe a couple of States seem to have
 
00:52:33.710 --> 00:52:33.720 align:start position:0%
found the solution
 
00:52:37.370 --> 00:52:37.380 align:start position:0%
um is it really that hard to solve if if
 
00:52:41.150 --> 00:52:41.160 align:start position:0%
the if the issue is the delay
 
00:52:43.609 --> 00:52:43.619 align:start position:0%
and the cost obviously
 
00:52:46.670 --> 00:52:46.680 align:start position:0%
of having each individual Telecom
 
00:52:49.370 --> 00:52:49.380 align:start position:0%
provider mobilize their own crew their
 
00:52:52.430 --> 00:52:52.440 align:start position:0%
own truck you know their own police
 
00:52:55.609 --> 00:52:55.619 align:start position:0%
detail to put cones around the truck in
 
00:52:58.250 --> 00:52:58.260 align:start position:0%
the street to work on that pole if if
 
00:53:01.490 --> 00:53:01.500 align:start position:0%
the solution is to have a contractor
 
00:53:03.710 --> 00:53:03.720 align:start position:0%
all the utility all the Telecom or all
 
00:53:06.829 --> 00:53:06.839 align:start position:0%
the utilities uh come up and fund a
 
00:53:09.290 --> 00:53:09.300 align:start position:0%
single contractor to make the transfers
 
00:53:12.470 --> 00:53:12.480 align:start position:0%
all at once a much more
 
00:53:14.870 --> 00:53:14.880 align:start position:0%
resource efficient solution is it really
 
00:53:17.870 --> 00:53:17.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:20.690 --> 00:53:20.700 align:start position:0%
is it hot excuse me it's hot no sir it's
 
00:53:23.150 --> 00:53:23.160 align:start position:0%
not it's getting everybody to agree to
 
00:53:25.130 --> 00:53:25.140 align:start position:0%
that that could be the difficulty
 
00:53:29.930 --> 00:53:29.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:32.270 --> 00:53:32.280 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:53:34.670 --> 00:53:34.680 align:start position:0%
okay seeing no more questions I want to
 
00:53:36.530 --> 00:53:36.540 align:start position:0%
thank the department of energy for being
 
00:53:38.390 --> 00:53:38.400 align:start position:0%
here to discuss
 
00:53:41.630 --> 00:53:41.640 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 16 with us and having no
 
00:53:44.690 --> 00:53:44.700 align:start position:0%
more pink cards on this bill I would
 
00:53:47.630 --> 00:53:47.640 align:start position:0%
like to close the public hearing or on
 
00:53:50.930 --> 00:53:50.940 align:start position:0%
Senate bill 16.
 
00:53:53.390 --> 00:53:53.400 align:start position:0%
we will now move on and open a public
 
00:53:56.809 --> 00:53:56.819 align:start position:0%
hearing on Senate Bill 40 relative to
 
00:53:59.990 --> 00:54:00.000 align:start position:0%
participation in net energy metering by
 
00:54:03.170 --> 00:54:03.180 align:start position:0%
small hydroelectric generators and I
 
00:54:05.390 --> 00:54:05.400 align:start position:0%
will call first on Senator David Waters
 
00:54:07.849 --> 00:54:07.859 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor of the bill
 
00:54:09.950 --> 00:54:09.960 align:start position:0%
well actually Senator abart I guess is
 
00:54:12.470 --> 00:54:12.480 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor so Senator Waters is
 
00:54:14.150 --> 00:54:14.160 align:start position:0%
filling in this morning for Senator
 
00:54:17.329 --> 00:54:17.339 align:start position:0%
abard so Senator it's all yours
 
00:54:19.250 --> 00:54:19.260 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman members of the
 
00:54:21.349 --> 00:54:21.359 align:start position:0%
committee on behalf of Senator avard I'm
 
00:54:21.359 --> 00:54:22.549 align:start position:0%
committee on behalf of Senator avard I'm
introducing

00:54:22.549 --> 00:54:22.559 align:start position:0%
introducing
 
00:54:24.349 --> 00:54:24.359 align:start position:0%
Senate bill
 
00:54:27.710 --> 00:54:27.720 align:start position:0%
um 40. uh this bill addresses a very
 
00:54:30.470 --> 00:54:30.480 align:start position:0%
particular situation
 
00:54:33.589 --> 00:54:33.599 align:start position:0%
um related to Brookline monac paper
 
00:54:35.329 --> 00:54:35.339 align:start position:0%
mills and
 
00:54:39.109 --> 00:54:39.119 align:start position:0%
um when we passed 315 and moved the net
 
00:54:43.010 --> 00:54:43.020 align:start position:0%
metering up to five megawatts this issue
 
00:54:44.809 --> 00:54:44.819 align:start position:0%
came to the fore because of the way in
 
00:54:46.609 --> 00:54:46.619 align:start position:0%
which the interconnection point is done
 
00:54:49.670 --> 00:54:49.680 align:start position:0%
for these two uh paper mills I think
 
00:54:51.710 --> 00:54:51.720 align:start position:0%
you'll see from the bipartisan
 
00:54:54.890 --> 00:54:54.900 align:start position:0%
on nature of the support for this bill
 
00:54:57.530 --> 00:54:57.540 align:start position:0%
and uh the testimony that we heard in
 
00:54:59.210 --> 00:54:59.220 align:start position:0%
the Senate that this is a problem that
 
00:55:00.530 --> 00:55:00.540 align:start position:0%
we kind of thought we had fixed
 
00:55:02.990 --> 00:55:03.000 align:start position:0%
previously but we realized we need to
 
00:55:04.790 --> 00:55:04.800 align:start position:0%
change some of the language a little bit
 
00:55:07.910 --> 00:55:07.920 align:start position:0%
to make sure that these paper mills can
 
00:55:10.670 --> 00:55:10.680 align:start position:0%
under the provisions of net metering and
 
00:55:12.890 --> 00:55:12.900 align:start position:0%
the kind of metering that they they do
 
00:55:15.650 --> 00:55:15.660 align:start position:0%
for their power production and the use
 
00:55:19.130 --> 00:55:19.140 align:start position:0%
on site that we can make this work for
 
00:55:21.290 --> 00:55:21.300 align:start position:0%
them so much of what you see in the bill
 
00:55:23.210 --> 00:55:23.220 align:start position:0%
and I know that Heidi Kroll is here to
 
00:55:25.309 --> 00:55:25.319 align:start position:0%
address some of the details
 
00:55:27.349 --> 00:55:27.359 align:start position:0%
um and uh but much of the detail that's
 
00:55:28.430 --> 00:55:28.440 align:start position:0%
in the bill
 
00:55:31.250 --> 00:55:31.260 align:start position:0%
gets that language right and part of it
 
00:55:35.349 --> 00:55:35.359 align:start position:0%
is to make sure that this bill is just
 
00:55:39.109 --> 00:55:39.119 align:start position:0%
for this situation
 
00:55:40.790 --> 00:55:40.800 align:start position:0%
I know we're in New Hampshire but not
 
00:55:42.470 --> 00:55:42.480 align:start position:0%
every bill is a slippery slope it's not
 
00:55:45.230 --> 00:55:45.240 align:start position:0%
a ski area Okay so IT addresses this
 
00:55:46.790 --> 00:55:46.800 align:start position:0%
particular issue by making a couple of
 
00:55:49.490 --> 00:55:49.500 align:start position:0%
tweaks to it and the we were very
 
00:55:51.170 --> 00:55:51.180 align:start position:0%
careful because the concerns raised by
 
00:55:52.790 --> 00:55:52.800 align:start position:0%
the department of energy about well then
 
00:55:54.049 --> 00:55:54.059 align:start position:0%
every other companies want to come in
 
00:55:56.089 --> 00:55:56.099 align:start position:0%
and do this say well they'd have to get
 
00:55:58.430 --> 00:55:58.440 align:start position:0%
us to pass a bill this bill is only for
 
00:56:00.470 --> 00:56:00.480 align:start position:0%
this it's does no slippery soap doesn't
 
00:56:02.750 --> 00:56:02.760 align:start position:0%
open other doors so what the bill does
 
00:56:05.569 --> 00:56:05.579 align:start position:0%
do is to clarify a couple of things it
 
00:56:06.770 --> 00:56:06.780 align:start position:0%
says that
 
00:56:08.150 --> 00:56:08.160 align:start position:0%
um you know each of these two
 
00:56:10.190 --> 00:56:10.200 align:start position:0%
hydroelectric dams the amount of power
 
00:56:11.690 --> 00:56:11.700 align:start position:0%
they generate they will be able to
 
00:56:13.849 --> 00:56:13.859 align:start position:0%
determine what they use on site and then
 
00:56:15.290 --> 00:56:15.300 align:start position:0%
what it's going to be potentially
 
00:56:15.300 --> 00:56:16.670 align:start position:0%
what it's going to be potentially
exported

00:56:16.670 --> 00:56:16.680 align:start position:0%
exported
 
00:56:19.910 --> 00:56:19.920 align:start position:0%
and they will be responsible for
 
00:56:21.770 --> 00:56:21.780 align:start position:0%
um the metering there and making reports
 
00:56:23.390 --> 00:56:23.400 align:start position:0%
intervene you have a transparent process
 
00:56:25.130 --> 00:56:25.140 align:start position:0%
and reports
 
00:56:27.410 --> 00:56:27.420 align:start position:0%
um in audits so that it is clear that
 
00:56:30.410 --> 00:56:30.420 align:start position:0%
the metering has been done uh in the
 
00:56:33.890 --> 00:56:33.900 align:start position:0%
appropriate appropriate way I know that
 
00:56:36.109 --> 00:56:36.119 align:start position:0%
you have because of a very recent
 
00:56:37.690 --> 00:56:37.700 align:start position:0%
agreement that has been reached between
 
00:56:41.630 --> 00:56:41.640 align:start position:0%
Brookline and White Mountain paper that
 
00:56:43.670 --> 00:56:43.680 align:start position:0%
the chair has an amendment which just
 
00:56:45.650 --> 00:56:45.660 align:start position:0%
tweaks the language a little bit more
 
00:56:47.930 --> 00:56:47.940 align:start position:0%
which I'm sure you will be discussing
 
00:56:49.549 --> 00:56:49.559 align:start position:0%
will be discussed by
 
00:56:51.890 --> 00:56:51.900 align:start position:0%
um Heidi Kroll when she comes up to to
 
00:56:54.170 --> 00:56:54.180 align:start position:0%
speak before you
 
00:56:56.930 --> 00:56:56.940 align:start position:0%
um so the technicalities are there I
 
00:57:00.170 --> 00:57:00.180 align:start position:0%
will probably leave most of that to
 
00:57:02.390 --> 00:57:02.400 align:start position:0%
um Heidi Kroll's and and others to
 
00:57:04.309 --> 00:57:04.319 align:start position:0%
answer but I think the big picture here
 
00:57:06.230 --> 00:57:06.240 align:start position:0%
is that you know we are committed to
 
00:57:09.410 --> 00:57:09.420 align:start position:0%
these hydroelectric generators and to
 
00:57:11.089 --> 00:57:11.099 align:start position:0%
the paper manufacturing these are
 
00:57:12.710 --> 00:57:12.720 align:start position:0%
important part of New Hampshire economy
 
00:57:15.049 --> 00:57:15.059 align:start position:0%
jobs and so on
 
00:57:17.690 --> 00:57:17.700 align:start position:0%
um I think also the basic principles
 
00:57:20.750 --> 00:57:20.760 align:start position:0%
under house bill 315 where we said that
 
00:57:23.390 --> 00:57:23.400 align:start position:0%
power produced in New Hampshire is good
 
00:57:25.430 --> 00:57:25.440 align:start position:0%
for New Hampshire
 
00:57:28.130 --> 00:57:28.140 align:start position:0%
um and it it helps us in a lot of ways
 
00:57:30.770 --> 00:57:30.780 align:start position:0%
to keep our potentially our costs down
 
00:57:33.890 --> 00:57:33.900 align:start position:0%
so this is one small piece in that and
 
00:57:36.650 --> 00:57:36.660 align:start position:0%
that and quite necessary for these two
 
00:57:38.210 --> 00:57:38.220 align:start position:0%
um for these paper mills and
 
00:57:40.309 --> 00:57:40.319 align:start position:0%
hydroelectric generation to be able to
 
00:57:42.650 --> 00:57:42.660 align:start position:0%
succeed under net metering thank you Mr
 
00:57:42.660 --> 00:57:43.970 align:start position:0%
succeed under net metering thank you Mr
chairman

00:57:43.970 --> 00:57:43.980 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
00:57:46.190 --> 00:57:46.200 align:start position:0%
thank you senator for introducing this
 
00:57:49.130 --> 00:57:49.140 align:start position:0%
bill on behalf of senator avard
 
00:57:52.130 --> 00:57:52.140 align:start position:0%
I know that as a member of Senate energy
 
00:57:54.770 --> 00:57:54.780 align:start position:0%
and natural resources you have been
 
00:57:57.890 --> 00:57:57.900 align:start position:0%
involved excuse me been involved in the
 
00:57:57.900 --> 00:57:59.410 align:start position:0%
involved excuse me been involved in the
uh

00:57:59.410 --> 00:57:59.420 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:58:02.329 --> 00:58:02.339 align:start position:0%
deliberations on the bill and the many
 
00:58:04.849 --> 00:58:04.859 align:start position:0%
changes that have been made to it over
 
00:58:06.650 --> 00:58:06.660 align:start position:0%
the course of the last six or eight
 
00:58:09.230 --> 00:58:09.240 align:start position:0%
months or whatever
 
00:58:12.170 --> 00:58:12.180 align:start position:0%
but I have a kind of a overarching
 
00:58:14.329 --> 00:58:14.339 align:start position:0%
fundamental question and that is that
 
00:58:16.609 --> 00:58:16.619 align:start position:0%
our constitution our state constitution
 
00:58:21.109 --> 00:58:21.119 align:start position:0%
says that we don't make laws that
 
00:58:23.690 --> 00:58:23.700 align:start position:0%
provide preferential treatment for any
 
00:58:27.710 --> 00:58:27.720 align:start position:0%
in person or group of persons so why is
 
00:58:31.250 --> 00:58:31.260 align:start position:0%
it justifiable to pass legislation like
 
00:58:33.890 --> 00:58:33.900 align:start position:0%
this which seems to be preferential to a
 
00:58:35.930 --> 00:58:35.940 align:start position:0%
small group of persons
 
00:58:38.750 --> 00:58:38.760 align:start position:0%
well thanks for your question and um
 
00:58:41.089 --> 00:58:41.099 align:start position:0%
my take on this not being a
 
00:58:42.890 --> 00:58:42.900 align:start position:0%
constitutional lawyer
 
00:58:45.230 --> 00:58:45.240 align:start position:0%
is that we are not being preferential
 
00:58:48.890 --> 00:58:48.900 align:start position:0%
what we are doing is clarifying that the
 
00:58:50.569 --> 00:58:50.579 align:start position:0%
policy that we have passed in this
 
00:58:54.049 --> 00:58:54.059 align:start position:0%
legislature can in fact apply as it
 
00:58:56.329 --> 00:58:56.339 align:start position:0%
appropriately should to entities that
 
00:58:59.270 --> 00:58:59.280 align:start position:0%
might take advantage of it and so I see
 
00:59:01.670 --> 00:59:01.680 align:start position:0%
this as a technical issue not a
 
00:59:04.069 --> 00:59:04.079 align:start position:0%
preferential one
 
00:59:06.349 --> 00:59:06.359 align:start position:0%
great thank you very much
 
00:59:10.270 --> 00:59:10.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:12.710 --> 00:59:12.720 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington has a question
 
00:59:14.630 --> 00:59:14.640 align:start position:0%
thank you chair thank you for taking my
 
00:59:14.640 --> 00:59:15.770 align:start position:0%
thank you chair thank you for taking my
question

00:59:15.770 --> 00:59:15.780 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:59:18.829 --> 00:59:18.839 align:start position:0%
um why the was energy storage facilities
 
00:59:21.349 --> 00:59:21.359 align:start position:0%
added I'm not quite sure what that I
 
00:59:23.390 --> 00:59:23.400 align:start position:0%
mean enlighten me I just don't know what
 
00:59:24.890 --> 00:59:24.900 align:start position:0%
it why it's there thanks for your
 
00:59:26.210 --> 00:59:26.220 align:start position:0%
question I should have mentioned that in
 
00:59:27.710 --> 00:59:27.720 align:start position:0%
my introduction
 
00:59:27.720 --> 00:59:28.490 align:start position:0%
my introduction
um

00:59:28.490 --> 00:59:28.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:31.190 --> 00:59:31.200 align:start position:0%
energy storage is becoming increasingly
 
00:59:33.289 --> 00:59:33.299 align:start position:0%
important component of how people
 
00:59:36.770 --> 00:59:36.780 align:start position:0%
operate their energy production because
 
00:59:39.530 --> 00:59:39.540 align:start position:0%
it allows you to take excess capacity
 
00:59:43.069 --> 00:59:43.079 align:start position:0%
use it on site later or use that as a
 
00:59:45.230 --> 00:59:45.240 align:start position:0%
way of exporting power into the grid
 
00:59:47.530 --> 00:59:47.540 align:start position:0%
when it's needed so you can avoid Peak
 
00:59:51.230 --> 00:59:51.240 align:start position:0%
uh demand charges and help out the
 
00:59:52.849 --> 00:59:52.859 align:start position:0%
overall system by being able to put
 
00:59:54.890 --> 00:59:54.900 align:start position:0%
energy back in and then filling up your
 
00:59:58.250 --> 00:59:58.260 align:start position:0%
batteries when um uh you know when when
 
01:00:00.950 --> 01:00:00.960 align:start position:0%
the power is cheaper and so for for
 
01:00:03.170 --> 01:00:03.180 align:start position:0%
these kinds of circumstances we are I
 
01:00:04.730 --> 01:00:04.740 align:start position:0%
think we're seeing that it seems
 
01:00:07.010 --> 01:00:07.020 align:start position:0%
appropriate under
 
01:00:09.349 --> 01:00:09.359 align:start position:0%
the statutes that we have passed the way
 
01:00:11.450 --> 01:00:11.460 align:start position:0%
in which we Define energy storage
 
01:00:14.089 --> 01:00:14.099 align:start position:0%
systems that we want to make sure that
 
01:00:16.849 --> 01:00:16.859 align:start position:0%
they are appropriately seen as part of a
 
01:00:19.609 --> 01:00:19.619 align:start position:0%
capacity here not as a separate kind of
 
01:00:21.230 --> 01:00:21.240 align:start position:0%
entity so that's why it's in there
 
01:00:24.770 --> 01:00:24.780 align:start position:0%
follow up follow up so uh just so I'm
 
01:00:27.109 --> 01:00:27.119 align:start position:0%
clear on this they let's say we're going
 
01:00:29.809 --> 01:00:29.819 align:start position:0%
to use batteries for example they the
 
01:00:32.210 --> 01:00:32.220 align:start position:0%
this uh the people that qualify under
 
01:00:34.250 --> 01:00:34.260 align:start position:0%
this provision could store as much of
 
01:00:36.650 --> 01:00:36.660 align:start position:0%
electricity as they could possibly get
 
01:00:38.270 --> 01:00:38.280 align:start position:0%
into batteries but they could only
 
01:00:40.849 --> 01:00:40.859 align:start position:0%
output at the same level is that they
 
01:00:43.010 --> 01:00:43.020 align:start position:0%
were allowed to generate so there'd be a
 
01:00:45.170 --> 01:00:45.180 align:start position:0%
cap on the output and mega in you know
 
01:00:47.630 --> 01:00:47.640 align:start position:0%
kilowatt hours for example
 
01:00:50.569 --> 01:00:50.579 align:start position:0%
yes thank you um I think you're
 
01:00:52.789 --> 01:00:52.799 align:start position:0%
absolutely right representative
 
01:00:54.230 --> 01:00:54.240 align:start position:0%
um about the way you that you're you're
 
01:00:56.089 --> 01:00:56.099 align:start position:0%
defining it that we're including it up
 
01:00:59.770 --> 01:00:59.780 align:start position:0%
here but the governing language over the
 
01:01:02.510 --> 01:01:02.520 align:start position:0%
net metering
 
01:01:04.730 --> 01:01:04.740 align:start position:0%
it is contained within that so it's not
 
01:01:06.589 --> 01:01:06.599 align:start position:0%
a separate kind of entity the overall
 
01:01:08.569 --> 01:01:08.579 align:start position:0%
question is however whether it's coming
 
01:01:11.089 --> 01:01:11.099 align:start position:0%
right off the right off the dam or if
 
01:01:13.430 --> 01:01:13.440 align:start position:0%
it's coming from the storage that we've
 
01:01:15.770 --> 01:01:15.780 align:start position:0%
put some of your power that the same
 
01:01:19.069 --> 01:01:19.079 align:start position:0%
this this you're still under under the
 
01:01:21.170 --> 01:01:21.180 align:start position:0%
same requirements of the five megawatts
 
01:01:23.450 --> 01:01:23.460 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:01:27.829 --> 01:01:27.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:29.870 --> 01:01:29.880 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you Senator Waters
 
01:01:31.910 --> 01:01:31.920 align:start position:0%
appreciate you being here Oops I did see
 
01:01:33.890 --> 01:01:33.900 align:start position:0%
representative Bernardi's hand but if
 
01:01:35.690 --> 01:01:35.700 align:start position:0%
it's getting any more technical I think
 
01:01:37.370 --> 01:01:37.380 align:start position:0%
it's got to go to the Hardy crawl okay
 
01:01:40.010 --> 01:01:40.020 align:start position:0%
all right Senator uh representative
 
01:01:43.010 --> 01:01:43.020 align:start position:0%
Bernardi okay thank you very much okay
 
01:01:45.530 --> 01:01:45.540 align:start position:0%
he defers all right so next up is uh
 
01:01:47.329 --> 01:01:47.339 align:start position:0%
Griffin Roberge from the Department of
 
01:01:47.339 --> 01:01:57.829 align:start position:0%
Griffin Roberge from the Department of
energy

01:01:57.829 --> 01:01:57.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:59.569 --> 01:01:59.579 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman vostner before you
 
01:02:02.569 --> 01:02:02.579 align:start position:0%
start uh Mr Ropers just I would like to
 
01:02:04.190 --> 01:02:04.200 align:start position:0%
remind members of the committee if you
 
01:02:07.250 --> 01:02:07.260 align:start position:0%
have electronic devices please mute them
 
01:02:08.870 --> 01:02:08.880 align:start position:0%
so that we don't
 
01:02:11.690 --> 01:02:11.700 align:start position:0%
constantly be barraged with dings and
 
01:02:15.410 --> 01:02:15.420 align:start position:0%
other noises thank you Mr robersh thank
 
01:02:17.329 --> 01:02:17.339 align:start position:0%
you uh for the record Griffin Roberge
 
01:02:19.069 --> 01:02:19.079 align:start position:0%
State energy program manager at the
 
01:02:21.230 --> 01:02:21.240 align:start position:0%
department of energy uh here to testify
 
01:02:23.270 --> 01:02:23.280 align:start position:0%
in opposition to Senate Bill 40 as
 
01:02:25.309 --> 01:02:25.319 align:start position:0%
amended by the Senate
 
01:02:27.650 --> 01:02:27.660 align:start position:0%
um for background this statute permits a
 
01:02:29.450 --> 01:02:29.460 align:start position:0%
hydroelectric generator with a total
 
01:02:32.150 --> 01:02:32.160 align:start position:0%
Peak capacity at or below one megawatt
 
01:02:35.270 --> 01:02:35.280 align:start position:0%
that began operation before July 1 of 21
 
01:02:37.430 --> 01:02:37.440 align:start position:0%
and shares equipment or facilities with
 
01:02:38.870 --> 01:02:38.880 align:start position:0%
other generators or electric utility
 
01:02:41.210 --> 01:02:41.220 align:start position:0%
customers for interconnection shall be
 
01:02:42.829 --> 01:02:42.839 align:start position:0%
able to participate in net energy
 
01:02:45.950 --> 01:02:45.960 align:start position:0%
metering even if the aggregate capacity
 
01:02:47.510 --> 01:02:47.520 align:start position:0%
of those generators exceeds the one
 
01:02:48.849 --> 01:02:48.859 align:start position:0%
megawatt cap
 
01:02:50.870 --> 01:02:50.880 align:start position:0%
for background because I think it's
 
01:02:53.390 --> 01:02:53.400 align:start position:0%
important is this statute was created in
 
01:02:56.870 --> 01:02:56.880 align:start position:0%
2021 through Senate Bill 91 to address
 
01:02:59.450 --> 01:02:59.460 align:start position:0%
the specific circumstance at Monadnock
 
01:03:01.670 --> 01:03:01.680 align:start position:0%
paper mills I'm sure folks who are
 
01:03:03.890 --> 01:03:03.900 align:start position:0%
around during that time remember all the
 
01:03:06.410 --> 01:03:06.420 align:start position:0%
various parts of that beautiful bill
 
01:03:09.230 --> 01:03:09.240 align:start position:0%
um that that Mill owns and operates
 
01:03:11.150 --> 01:03:11.160 align:start position:0%
three small hydroelectric facilities
 
01:03:13.490 --> 01:03:13.500 align:start position:0%
behind the meter at the Mill site and
 
01:03:15.770 --> 01:03:15.780 align:start position:0%
all of those dams share the single
 
01:03:18.410 --> 01:03:18.420 align:start position:0%
interconnection point collectively those
 
01:03:20.990 --> 01:03:21.000 align:start position:0%
three dams constitute about 1.9
 
01:03:24.049 --> 01:03:24.059 align:start position:0%
megawatts of capacity but due to net
 
01:03:26.089 --> 01:03:26.099 align:start position:0%
metering laws and rules at the time
 
01:03:28.190 --> 01:03:28.200 align:start position:0%
those three dams were considered a
 
01:03:31.010 --> 01:03:31.020 align:start position:0%
single 1.9 megawatt facility and were
 
01:03:32.750 --> 01:03:32.760 align:start position:0%
unable to net meter their excess
 
01:03:32.760 --> 01:03:34.069 align:start position:0%
unable to net meter their excess
generation

01:03:34.069 --> 01:03:34.079 align:start position:0%
generation
 
01:03:36.349 --> 01:03:36.359 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 91 created in statute you
 
01:03:40.430 --> 01:03:40.440 align:start position:0%
largely see on lines three to twelve
 
01:03:43.609 --> 01:03:43.619 align:start position:0%
um uh created the statute to remedy this
 
01:03:45.589 --> 01:03:45.599 align:start position:0%
unique issue to allow Monadnock paper
 
01:03:48.230 --> 01:03:48.240 align:start position:0%
mills to participate in net metering as
 
01:03:49.910 --> 01:03:49.920 align:start position:0%
customer generators based on their
 
01:03:51.829 --> 01:03:51.839 align:start position:0%
individual total Peak generating
 
01:03:53.990 --> 01:03:54.000 align:start position:0%
capacity and not be restricted from
 
01:03:55.549 --> 01:03:55.559 align:start position:0%
doing so because they just shared a
 
01:03:58.250 --> 01:03:58.260 align:start position:0%
single interconnection point what Senate
 
01:04:00.710 --> 01:04:00.720 align:start position:0%
Bill 40 seeks to do is it amends that
 
01:04:03.410 --> 01:04:03.420 align:start position:0%
statute further to permit those types of
 
01:04:05.390 --> 01:04:05.400 align:start position:0%
facilities to be as outlined
 
01:04:09.349 --> 01:04:09.359 align:start position:0%
specifically on lines 12 to 15. eligible
 
01:04:12.170 --> 01:04:12.180 align:start position:0%
as a customer generator as a matter of
 
01:04:14.329 --> 01:04:14.339 align:start position:0%
law without regard to whether such
 
01:04:16.549 --> 01:04:16.559 align:start position:0%
hydroelectric generator is the electric
 
01:04:18.950 --> 01:04:18.960 align:start position:0%
utility customer account of record at
 
01:04:20.510 --> 01:04:20.520 align:start position:0%
the point of interconnection to the
 
01:04:23.390 --> 01:04:23.400 align:start position:0%
electric grid the department is strongly
 
01:04:25.670 --> 01:04:25.680 align:start position:0%
opposed to this language and strongly
 
01:04:27.530 --> 01:04:27.540 align:start position:0%
wants to convey to policy makers that
 
01:04:30.109 --> 01:04:30.119 align:start position:0%
this is a significant policy decision
 
01:04:33.230 --> 01:04:33.240 align:start position:0%
that lies before them the remainder of
 
01:04:36.049 --> 01:04:36.059 align:start position:0%
this bill from LA lines 15 on spell out
 
01:04:37.730 --> 01:04:37.740 align:start position:0%
a process by which the hydroelectric
 
01:04:39.770 --> 01:04:39.780 align:start position:0%
generator would submit information to
 
01:04:41.390 --> 01:04:41.400 align:start position:0%
the department regarding the facility's
 
01:04:43.370 --> 01:04:43.380 align:start position:0%
proposed methodology for reading and
 
01:04:46.190 --> 01:04:46.200 align:start position:0%
document documenting that meter data the
 
01:04:48.710 --> 01:04:48.720 align:start position:0%
department has really no position on any
 
01:04:51.289 --> 01:04:51.299 align:start position:0%
of that we'd be fine with with that
 
01:04:53.870 --> 01:04:53.880 align:start position:0%
language it is quite technical but our
 
01:04:57.410 --> 01:04:57.420 align:start position:0%
concern lies on lines 12 to 15.
 
01:04:59.569 --> 01:04:59.579 align:start position:0%
because it under it fundamentally
 
01:05:01.609 --> 01:05:01.619 align:start position:0%
undermines the current statute by
 
01:05:04.549 --> 01:05:04.559 align:start position:0%
allowing a hydroelectric generator a
 
01:05:07.549 --> 01:05:07.559 align:start position:0%
generator not a customer itself to be
 
01:05:09.230 --> 01:05:09.240 align:start position:0%
considered a customer generator
 
01:05:12.410 --> 01:05:12.420 align:start position:0%
regardless of whether that generator is
 
01:05:13.910 --> 01:05:13.920 align:start position:0%
the utility customer point of
 
01:05:16.430 --> 01:05:16.440 align:start position:0%
interconnection in short the bill seeks
 
01:05:18.470 --> 01:05:18.480 align:start position:0%
to remove customer from customer
 
01:05:21.890 --> 01:05:21.900 align:start position:0%
generator and allows a generator located
 
01:05:24.230 --> 01:05:24.240 align:start position:0%
behind the meter and not a utility
 
01:05:27.410 --> 01:05:27.420 align:start position:0%
customer itself to derive the benefits
 
01:05:30.589 --> 01:05:30.599 align:start position:0%
of net metering in New Hampshire the
 
01:05:32.329 --> 01:05:32.339 align:start position:0%
Genesis of this bill as well as House
 
01:05:34.670 --> 01:05:34.680 align:start position:0%
Bill 458 which this committee retained
 
01:05:36.770 --> 01:05:36.780 align:start position:0%
stems from several hydroelectric
 
01:05:38.630 --> 01:05:38.640 align:start position:0%
facilities owned by Brookfield Renewable
 
01:05:40.730 --> 01:05:40.740 align:start position:0%
that are located behind the meter at
 
01:05:42.410 --> 01:05:42.420 align:start position:0%
White Mountain paper in Gorham New
 
01:05:44.890 --> 01:05:44.900 align:start position:0%
Hampshire on paper White Mountain paper
 
01:05:47.690 --> 01:05:47.700 align:start position:0%
is the utility customer and serves as
 
01:05:50.030 --> 01:05:50.040 align:start position:0%
the interconnection point for all of
 
01:05:52.010 --> 01:05:52.020 align:start position:0%
these hydroelectric dams are located
 
01:05:55.010 --> 01:05:55.020 align:start position:0%
behind the meter how Brookfield sells
 
01:05:57.349 --> 01:05:57.359 align:start position:0%
power from its hydroelectric assets is
 
01:05:59.630 --> 01:05:59.640 align:start position:0%
outlined an existing power purchase
 
01:06:01.789 --> 01:06:01.799 align:start position:0%
agreement between both of those private
 
01:06:04.190 --> 01:06:04.200 align:start position:0%
parties while some may argue that Senate
 
01:06:05.930 --> 01:06:05.940 align:start position:0%
Bill 40 only affects this one
 
01:06:07.849 --> 01:06:07.859 align:start position:0%
Arrangement between Brookfield and White
 
01:06:10.010 --> 01:06:10.020 align:start position:0%
Mountain paper the department cannot
 
01:06:12.109 --> 01:06:12.119 align:start position:0%
authoritatively confirm that the
 
01:06:13.609 --> 01:06:13.619 align:start position:0%
department does not maintain the
 
01:06:15.710 --> 01:06:15.720 align:start position:0%
database or a master list of all the
 
01:06:18.289 --> 01:06:18.299 align:start position:0%
metering Arrangements in the state there
 
01:06:20.690 --> 01:06:20.700 align:start position:0%
may very well be potentially we cannot
 
01:06:22.609 --> 01:06:22.619 align:start position:0%
confirm this other hydroelectric
 
01:06:24.109 --> 01:06:24.119 align:start position:0%
facilities and private entities that
 
01:06:25.910 --> 01:06:25.920 align:start position:0%
this bill in this language would impact
 
01:06:28.309 --> 01:06:28.319 align:start position:0%
and again policymakers should be aware
 
01:06:30.049 --> 01:06:30.059 align:start position:0%
that this is an important policy
 
01:06:32.630 --> 01:06:32.640 align:start position:0%
consideration net metering in essence
 
01:06:34.609 --> 01:06:34.619 align:start position:0%
allows for excess generation at the
 
01:06:37.010 --> 01:06:37.020 align:start position:0%
customer level to be added to the grid
 
01:06:38.870 --> 01:06:38.880 align:start position:0%
the fundamental issue that this language
 
01:06:41.029 --> 01:06:41.039 align:start position:0%
aligns 12 to 15 presents is it
 
01:06:42.289 --> 01:06:42.299 align:start position:0%
establishes a precedent for
 
01:06:44.930 --> 01:06:44.940 align:start position:0%
hydroelectric generators to try to amend
 
01:06:47.510 --> 01:06:47.520 align:start position:0%
State Statute to slowly chip away at the
 
01:06:49.370 --> 01:06:49.380 align:start position:0%
definition of what a customer generator
 
01:06:51.890 --> 01:06:51.900 align:start position:0%
truly is
 
01:06:54.170 --> 01:06:54.180 align:start position:0%
we do continue to contend that any
 
01:06:56.390 --> 01:06:56.400 align:start position:0%
characterization that this bill or the
 
01:06:58.370 --> 01:06:58.380 align:start position:0%
bill that was entertained earlier House
 
01:07:00.829 --> 01:07:00.839 align:start position:0%
Bill 458 is a technical fix or a minor
 
01:07:03.470 --> 01:07:03.480 align:start position:0%
change or a cleanup is inaccurate there
 
01:07:05.029 --> 01:07:05.039 align:start position:0%
is nothing in the record from Senate
 
01:07:07.670 --> 01:07:07.680 align:start position:0%
Bill 491 in either the house or the
 
01:07:09.890 --> 01:07:09.900 align:start position:0%
Senate to indicate that that bill in
 
01:07:11.569 --> 01:07:11.579 align:start position:0%
this statute was meant to cover any
 
01:07:13.190 --> 01:07:13.200 align:start position:0%
Arrangement between Brookfield and White
 
01:07:15.589 --> 01:07:15.599 align:start position:0%
Mountain paper it does not incentivize
 
01:07:17.690 --> 01:07:17.700 align:start position:0%
any new generation or directly lower
 
01:07:20.390 --> 01:07:20.400 align:start position:0%
electric rates again it's a significant
 
01:07:22.309 --> 01:07:22.319 align:start position:0%
policy change that this committee should
 
01:07:23.870 --> 01:07:23.880 align:start position:0%
carefully consider
 
01:07:26.630 --> 01:07:26.640 align:start position:0%
enacting this change creates a precedent
 
01:07:29.150 --> 01:07:29.160 align:start position:0%
for certain facilities to capitalize on
 
01:07:31.789 --> 01:07:31.799 align:start position:0%
the benefits of net metering and opens
 
01:07:33.410 --> 01:07:33.420 align:start position:0%
the door for future legislative attempts
 
01:07:34.970 --> 01:07:34.980 align:start position:0%
to slowly chip away at the definition of
 
01:07:36.950 --> 01:07:36.960 align:start position:0%
customer generator and I do want to
 
01:07:39.470 --> 01:07:39.480 align:start position:0%
emphasize that while A legislature
 
01:07:41.870 --> 01:07:41.880 align:start position:0%
cannot bind a future legislature by
 
01:07:43.849 --> 01:07:43.859 align:start position:0%
continually cracking opening that door
 
01:07:45.289 --> 01:07:45.299 align:start position:0%
if you do it for one you could
 
01:07:47.150 --> 01:07:47.160 align:start position:0%
potentially make an argument that others
 
01:07:49.069 --> 01:07:49.079 align:start position:0%
could come forward and do the same that
 
01:07:50.630 --> 01:07:50.640 align:start position:0%
is the argument that the department is
 
01:07:53.630 --> 01:07:53.640 align:start position:0%
presenting to you here today again the
 
01:07:55.730 --> 01:07:55.740 align:start position:0%
department believes that this bill stems
 
01:07:57.289 --> 01:07:57.299 align:start position:0%
from an existing power purchase
 
01:07:59.210 --> 01:07:59.220 align:start position:0%
agreement that was again arrived at
 
01:08:01.130 --> 01:08:01.140 align:start position:0%
between two private parties White
 
01:08:03.109 --> 01:08:03.119 align:start position:0%
Mountain paper and Brookfield Renewable
 
01:08:05.990 --> 01:08:06.000 align:start position:0%
it's our understanding that that there
 
01:08:07.549 --> 01:08:07.559 align:start position:0%
have been some discussions that there's
 
01:08:09.470 --> 01:08:09.480 align:start position:0%
potentially an amendment that's been
 
01:08:12.049 --> 01:08:12.059 align:start position:0%
reached by both parties that amendment
 
01:08:14.029 --> 01:08:14.039 align:start position:0%
was shared with the Department I believe
 
01:08:16.630 --> 01:08:16.640 align:start position:0%
Saturday or Sunday this weekend
 
01:08:19.070 --> 01:08:19.080 align:start position:0%
our department is reviewing that
 
01:08:20.749 --> 01:08:20.759 align:start position:0%
language and doesn't take a position on
 
01:08:21.890 --> 01:08:21.900 align:start position:0%
anything like that but I'm just
 
01:08:24.769 --> 01:08:24.779 align:start position:0%
commenting on the bill which is here the
 
01:08:26.150 --> 01:08:26.160 align:start position:0%
department does believe that there may
 
01:08:28.370 --> 01:08:28.380 align:start position:0%
potentially be a non-legislative fix
 
01:08:30.650 --> 01:08:30.660 align:start position:0%
that could address this issue in the
 
01:08:33.470 --> 01:08:33.480 align:start position:0%
existing power purchase agreement and
 
01:08:35.269 --> 01:08:35.279 align:start position:0%
with that I'm happy to conclude my
 
01:08:38.150 --> 01:08:38.160 align:start position:0%
testimony and take any questions
 
01:08:40.010 --> 01:08:40.020 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative
 
01:08:42.470 --> 01:08:42.480 align:start position:0%
Bernardi has a question for you
 
01:08:45.050 --> 01:08:45.060 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman so uh I believe
 
01:08:47.630 --> 01:08:47.640 align:start position:0%
you answered the question that I was
 
01:08:51.349 --> 01:08:51.359 align:start position:0%
going to ask but uh that is are there
 
01:08:54.289 --> 01:08:54.299 align:start position:0%
are you aware of any other Hydro
 
01:08:58.070 --> 01:08:58.080 align:start position:0%
facility situations which
 
01:09:00.590 --> 01:09:00.600 align:start position:0%
uh this bill could apply to beyond the
 
01:09:04.030 --> 01:09:04.040 align:start position:0%
Brookfield uh one and I think you said
 
01:09:06.650 --> 01:09:06.660 align:start position:0%
there's possibility that there are more
 
01:09:08.630 --> 01:09:08.640 align:start position:0%
but you just don't know we just don't
 
01:09:11.809 --> 01:09:11.819 align:start position:0%
know that's correct thank you
 
01:09:14.749 --> 01:09:14.759 align:start position:0%
further questions for Mr Roberge
 
01:09:17.269 --> 01:09:17.279 align:start position:0%
representative Nutter has one thank you
 
01:09:19.550 --> 01:09:19.560 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman when you testified in the
 
01:09:21.289 --> 01:09:21.299 align:start position:0%
Senate what was their reasoning for
 
01:09:24.349 --> 01:09:24.359 align:start position:0%
leading in this language on lines 12 to
 
01:09:28.249 --> 01:09:28.259 align:start position:0%
15. uh I I I can't speak for that just
 
01:09:29.809 --> 01:09:29.819 align:start position:0%
because a counterpart of mine Josh
 
01:09:31.970 --> 01:09:31.980 align:start position:0%
Elliott testifies uh before the Senate
 
01:09:33.950 --> 01:09:33.960 align:start position:0%
but our concern was much the same over
 
01:09:35.809 --> 01:09:35.819 align:start position:0%
there I think
 
01:09:38.269 --> 01:09:38.279 align:start position:0%
um in the broadest Strokes off the top
 
01:09:39.950 --> 01:09:39.960 align:start position:0%
of my head I do not believe the Senate
 
01:09:44.410 --> 01:09:44.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:46.430 --> 01:09:46.440 align:start position:0%
additional questions representative
 
01:09:48.110 --> 01:09:48.120 align:start position:0%
McGee has one
 
01:09:49.910 --> 01:09:49.920 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you Mr
 
01:09:52.490 --> 01:09:52.500 align:start position:0%
robesch for taking my question
 
01:09:55.010 --> 01:09:55.020 align:start position:0%
um you mentioned changes to the power
 
01:09:57.110 --> 01:09:57.120 align:start position:0%
purchase agreement but I thought this
 
01:09:58.930 --> 01:09:58.940 align:start position:0%
bill was to try and correct the
 
01:10:01.729 --> 01:10:01.739 align:start position:0%
additional energy that would be eligible
 
01:10:04.189 --> 01:10:04.199 align:start position:0%
for net metering which would be really
 
01:10:04.199 --> 01:10:05.330 align:start position:0%
for net metering which would be really
just

01:10:05.330 --> 01:10:05.340 align:start position:0%
just
 
01:10:08.870 --> 01:10:08.880 align:start position:0%
um adding these small Hydro facilities
 
01:10:12.830 --> 01:10:12.840 align:start position:0%
to SB 91 I I think the reason that it's
 
01:10:15.350 --> 01:10:15.360 align:start position:0%
um that it's got so much bipartisan
 
01:10:17.090 --> 01:10:17.100 align:start position:0%
support on both sides of the wall is
 
01:10:19.130 --> 01:10:19.140 align:start position:0%
probably because most of us are
 
01:10:20.630 --> 01:10:20.640 align:start position:0%
acknowledging that there was an intent
 
01:10:22.130 --> 01:10:22.140 align:start position:0%
there that these guys would be included
 
01:10:24.530 --> 01:10:24.540 align:start position:0%
in the first place sure and thank you
 
01:10:25.490 --> 01:10:25.500 align:start position:0%
for the question
 
01:10:28.790 --> 01:10:28.800 align:start position:0%
um you know I look through I I was in
 
01:10:30.470 --> 01:10:30.480 align:start position:0%
the Senate when Senate Bill 91 went
 
01:10:32.090 --> 01:10:32.100 align:start position:0%
through I spent some time going through
 
01:10:33.709 --> 01:10:33.719 align:start position:0%
the record for both of those bills I
 
01:10:35.090 --> 01:10:35.100 align:start position:0%
think anybody who was around during that
 
01:10:37.669 --> 01:10:37.679 align:start position:0%
time remembered that the reasoning
 
01:10:41.209 --> 01:10:41.219 align:start position:0%
behind this language was for a specific
 
01:10:43.729 --> 01:10:43.739 align:start position:0%
Arrangement at Monadnock paper mills to
 
01:10:47.030 --> 01:10:47.040 align:start position:0%
address that specific instance now this
 
01:10:48.770 --> 01:10:48.780 align:start position:0%
bill comes forward and seeks to say well
 
01:10:51.350 --> 01:10:51.360 align:start position:0%
there's another one that wasn't covered
 
01:10:54.590 --> 01:10:54.600 align:start position:0%
um the department contends that you know
 
01:10:56.630 --> 01:10:56.640 align:start position:0%
this is a policy decision that folks are
 
01:10:58.970 --> 01:10:58.980 align:start position:0%
making you are slowly opening the door
 
01:11:01.250 --> 01:11:01.260 align:start position:0%
to weather down the actual definition of
 
01:11:02.750 --> 01:11:02.760 align:start position:0%
customer generate it's a different thing
 
01:11:04.850 --> 01:11:04.860 align:start position:0%
between Monadnock paper and this one
 
01:11:07.250 --> 01:11:07.260 align:start position:0%
where in the monadnaught instance all
 
01:11:08.689 --> 01:11:08.699 align:start position:0%
three of those hydroelectric facilities
 
01:11:11.030 --> 01:11:11.040 align:start position:0%
were owned by monadnaught paper mills
 
01:11:12.590 --> 01:11:12.600 align:start position:0%
this is entirely different we have
 
01:11:14.030 --> 01:11:14.040 align:start position:0%
Brookfield Renewable owning the
 
01:11:15.770 --> 01:11:15.780 align:start position:0%
facilities and then White Mountain paper
 
01:11:17.570 --> 01:11:17.580 align:start position:0%
serving as the interconnection point for
 
01:11:19.970 --> 01:11:19.980 align:start position:0%
those facilities so whereas before
 
01:11:22.610 --> 01:11:22.620 align:start position:0%
ownership was linear across the board in
 
01:11:24.590 --> 01:11:24.600 align:start position:0%
this instance it isn't
 
01:11:27.530 --> 01:11:27.540 align:start position:0%
um we do have again significant concern
 
01:11:29.390 --> 01:11:29.400 align:start position:0%
with the with the language on on lines
 
01:11:31.490 --> 01:11:31.500 align:start position:0%
12 to 15 that indicate that
 
01:11:33.229 --> 01:11:33.239 align:start position:0%
hydroelectric facilities such as those
 
01:11:36.290 --> 01:11:36.300 align:start position:0%
in that instance are now a customer
 
01:11:38.090 --> 01:11:38.100 align:start position:0%
generators regardless of whether or not
 
01:11:40.729 --> 01:11:40.739 align:start position:0%
they are the electric utility customer
 
01:11:43.250 --> 01:11:43.260 align:start position:0%
on the account of record
 
01:11:45.530 --> 01:11:45.540 align:start position:0%
um it just it Waters down effectively
 
01:11:47.330 --> 01:11:47.340 align:start position:0%
the definition of customer generator why
 
01:11:48.770 --> 01:11:48.780 align:start position:0%
do we think it carries significant
 
01:11:50.510 --> 01:11:50.520 align:start position:0%
consideration for policy makers to
 
01:11:50.520 --> 01:11:51.950 align:start position:0%
consideration for policy makers to
consider

01:11:51.950 --> 01:11:51.960 align:start position:0%
consider
 
01:11:55.370 --> 01:11:55.380 align:start position:0%
follow-up yes thank you Mr chairman
 
01:11:57.350 --> 01:11:57.360 align:start position:0%
um I just I'm still laughing at Waters
 
01:11:59.030 --> 01:11:59.040 align:start position:0%
down I thought that was cute
 
01:11:59.040 --> 01:12:00.110 align:start position:0%
down I thought that was cute
um

01:12:00.110 --> 01:12:00.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:12:00.120 --> 01:12:01.729 align:start position:0%
um
so

01:12:01.729 --> 01:12:01.739 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:12:04.729 --> 01:12:04.739 align:start position:0%
you know I think I I think I lost my
 
01:12:07.610 --> 01:12:07.620 align:start position:0%
follow-up okay representative munz has a
 
01:12:09.890 --> 01:12:09.900 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
01:12:12.410 --> 01:12:12.420 align:start position:0%
for coming in today
 
01:12:14.990 --> 01:12:15.000 align:start position:0%
um uh I know I'm I'm I know I'm four
 
01:12:17.149 --> 01:12:17.159 align:start position:0%
months into my education on this on
 
01:12:19.189 --> 01:12:19.199 align:start position:0%
these topics but uh still a lot to learn
 
01:12:20.810 --> 01:12:20.820 align:start position:0%
so bear with me
 
01:12:23.870 --> 01:12:23.880 align:start position:0%
um what is the what is the economic loss
 
01:12:26.750 --> 01:12:26.760 align:start position:0%
that I assume Brookfield
 
01:12:30.169 --> 01:12:30.179 align:start position:0%
believes they are suffering that is that
 
01:12:32.330 --> 01:12:32.340 align:start position:0%
we're trying to remedy thank you for the
 
01:12:34.610 --> 01:12:34.620 align:start position:0%
question I I would respectfully suggest
 
01:12:36.050 --> 01:12:36.060 align:start position:0%
you maybe asking that question the
 
01:12:37.729 --> 01:12:37.739 align:start position:0%
Brookfield when they come up to testify
 
01:12:40.070 --> 01:12:40.080 align:start position:0%
okay thank you thank you
 
01:12:41.930 --> 01:12:41.940 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas has a question
 
01:12:43.970 --> 01:12:43.980 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr thanks to thank you for
 
01:12:45.290 --> 01:12:45.300 align:start position:0%
taking my question just for
 
01:12:48.110 --> 01:12:48.120 align:start position:0%
clarification uh
 
01:12:51.470 --> 01:12:51.480 align:start position:0%
um I agree with what you're assessing
 
01:12:54.410 --> 01:12:54.420 align:start position:0%
there so but could you explain what is
 
01:12:57.590 --> 01:12:57.600 align:start position:0%
the what will be the overall effect of
 
01:12:59.570 --> 01:12:59.580 align:start position:0%
your perception of this policy change
 
01:13:02.270 --> 01:13:02.280 align:start position:0%
going forward in the future thank you so
 
01:13:05.149 --> 01:13:05.159 align:start position:0%
I think the Department's position is
 
01:13:06.590 --> 01:13:06.600 align:start position:0%
that it creates
 
01:13:08.689 --> 01:13:08.699 align:start position:0%
in our and in our opinion the dangerous
 
01:13:11.270 --> 01:13:11.280 align:start position:0%
precedent is that the legislature if
 
01:13:13.550 --> 01:13:13.560 align:start position:0%
enacting this bill effectively allows a
 
01:13:15.890 --> 01:13:15.900 align:start position:0%
generator not a customer itself but an
 
01:13:17.810 --> 01:13:17.820 align:start position:0%
actual generator to derive the benefits
 
01:13:19.970 --> 01:13:19.980 align:start position:0%
of net energy metering
 
01:13:19.980 --> 01:13:20.689 align:start position:0%
of net energy metering
um

01:13:20.689 --> 01:13:20.699 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:13:23.689 --> 01:13:23.699 align:start position:0%
it opens the door and again a current
 
01:13:25.010 --> 01:13:25.020 align:start position:0%
legislature cannot bind to Future
 
01:13:27.169 --> 01:13:27.179 align:start position:0%
legislature anybody can bring forward a
 
01:13:30.110 --> 01:13:30.120 align:start position:0%
bill any on any issue that they want
 
01:13:30.120 --> 01:13:30.709 align:start position:0%
bill any on any issue that they want
um

01:13:30.709 --> 01:13:30.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:13:33.410 --> 01:13:33.420 align:start position:0%
it opens the door for other folks other
 
01:13:35.090 --> 01:13:35.100 align:start position:0%
generators to make the case before
 
01:13:37.430 --> 01:13:37.440 align:start position:0%
legislatures legislators in the future
 
01:13:39.169 --> 01:13:39.179 align:start position:0%
that hey you know
 
01:13:40.910 --> 01:13:40.920 align:start position:0%
we'd like we'd like you to do this
 
01:13:42.530 --> 01:13:42.540 align:start position:0%
because you did it for you did it in
 
01:13:44.209 --> 01:13:44.219 align:start position:0%
these instances in the past why not do
 
01:13:46.370 --> 01:13:46.380 align:start position:0%
it for this and again in our opinion it
 
01:13:48.229 --> 01:13:48.239 align:start position:0%
starts to slowly open the door for
 
01:13:50.630 --> 01:13:50.640 align:start position:0%
watering down the uh provisions of
 
01:13:53.030 --> 01:13:53.040 align:start position:0%
customer generator thank you
 
01:13:56.149 --> 01:13:56.159 align:start position:0%
representative Corman has a question
 
01:13:57.950 --> 01:13:57.960 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you Mr
 
01:14:00.950 --> 01:14:00.960 align:start position:0%
Roberts yeah so I'm I'm still trying to
 
01:14:03.050 --> 01:14:03.060 align:start position:0%
wrap my head around what is the real
 
01:14:05.689 --> 01:14:05.699 align:start position:0%
problem about
 
01:14:08.330 --> 01:14:08.340 align:start position:0%
changing what their customer generator
 
01:14:10.910 --> 01:14:10.920 align:start position:0%
is what what what are the implications
 
01:14:13.970 --> 01:14:13.980 align:start position:0%
that that that it's such a big problem
 
01:14:16.189 --> 01:14:16.199 align:start position:0%
sure so thank you for the question so
 
01:14:18.229 --> 01:14:18.239 align:start position:0%
again net metering in the state allows
 
01:14:20.390 --> 01:14:20.400 align:start position:0%
for excess generation again at the
 
01:14:22.970 --> 01:14:22.980 align:start position:0%
customer level to be added to the grid
 
01:14:24.709 --> 01:14:24.719 align:start position:0%
that Excess power that you put back on
 
01:14:26.630 --> 01:14:26.640 align:start position:0%
the grid so solar on one's house that
 
01:14:28.729 --> 01:14:28.739 align:start position:0%
type of thing that they own this is
 
01:14:31.390 --> 01:14:31.400 align:start position:0%
entirely different this is these are not
 
01:14:34.310 --> 01:14:34.320 align:start position:0%
insignificant hydroelectric assets these
 
01:14:36.229 --> 01:14:36.239 align:start position:0%
are in you know well over I think 10
 
01:14:37.850 --> 01:14:37.860 align:start position:0%
megawatts and I think Brookfield can
 
01:14:39.410 --> 01:14:39.420 align:start position:0%
certainly provide
 
01:14:42.010 --> 01:14:42.020 align:start position:0%
um further information on that but
 
01:14:45.110 --> 01:14:45.120 align:start position:0%
these hydroelectric resources are not
 
01:14:46.870 --> 01:14:46.880 align:start position:0%
interconnected to the grids themselves
 
01:14:48.890 --> 01:14:48.900 align:start position:0%
they can certainly undertake that
 
01:14:50.810 --> 01:14:50.820 align:start position:0%
process but I imagine they don't that
 
01:14:52.550 --> 01:14:52.560 align:start position:0%
that would be very cost prohibitive for
 
01:14:55.189 --> 01:14:55.199 align:start position:0%
them to do so what they want to do from
 
01:14:57.410 --> 01:14:57.420 align:start position:0%
what is online's 12 to 15 is that they
 
01:14:59.510 --> 01:14:59.520 align:start position:0%
are not the customer they are not the
 
01:15:01.790 --> 01:15:01.800 align:start position:0%
customer of record White Mountain paper
 
01:15:05.689 --> 01:15:05.699 align:start position:0%
is they want to in our view
 
01:15:07.850 --> 01:15:07.860 align:start position:0%
um circum you know walk around that with
 
01:15:11.450 --> 01:15:11.460 align:start position:0%
language on on lines 12 to 15. they
 
01:15:13.310 --> 01:15:13.320 align:start position:0%
are now a customer generator as a matter
 
01:15:15.050 --> 01:15:15.060 align:start position:0%
of law with no regard as to whether or
 
01:15:16.790 --> 01:15:16.800 align:start position:0%
not they are interconnected to the grid
 
01:15:18.530 --> 01:15:18.540 align:start position:0%
themselves or they are the utility
 
01:15:21.770 --> 01:15:21.780 align:start position:0%
customer themselves again you are in in
 
01:15:24.410 --> 01:15:24.420 align:start position:0%
in essence allowing a generator itself
 
01:15:27.290 --> 01:15:27.300 align:start position:0%
to derive the benefits of net energy
 
01:15:31.850 --> 01:15:31.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:35.830 --> 01:15:35.840 align:start position:0%
so did I just understand you to say that
 
01:15:38.810 --> 01:15:38.820 align:start position:0%
the facilities that are addressed in
 
01:15:43.189 --> 01:15:43.199 align:start position:0%
this bill namely the Brookfield uh owned
 
01:15:46.189 --> 01:15:46.199 align:start position:0%
hydroelectric facilities are much larger
 
01:15:48.649 --> 01:15:48.659 align:start position:0%
than the Monadnock paper mill facilities
 
01:15:50.390 --> 01:15:50.400 align:start position:0%
that were addressed by the earlier
 
01:15:51.830 --> 01:15:51.840 align:start position:0%
legislation that's the Department's
 
01:15:51.840 --> 01:15:52.970 align:start position:0%
legislation that's the Department's
understanding

01:15:52.970 --> 01:15:52.980 align:start position:0%
understanding
 
01:15:56.090 --> 01:15:56.100 align:start position:0%
representative Reynolds has a question
 
01:15:58.189 --> 01:15:58.199 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you Mr
 
01:16:00.830 --> 01:16:00.840 align:start position:0%
Roberts for being here um at the end of
 
01:16:00.840 --> 01:16:01.850 align:start position:0%
Roberts for being here um at the end of
your

01:16:01.850 --> 01:16:01.860 align:start position:0%
your
 
01:16:04.370 --> 01:16:04.380 align:start position:0%
just at the end of your introductory
 
01:16:06.530 --> 01:16:06.540 align:start position:0%
remarks I thought I thought I heard you
 
01:16:06.540 --> 01:16:07.610 align:start position:0%
remarks I thought I thought I heard you
say

01:16:07.610 --> 01:16:07.620 align:start position:0%
say
 
01:16:10.490 --> 01:16:10.500 align:start position:0%
that you believe there might be a
 
01:16:13.430 --> 01:16:13.440 align:start position:0%
non-legislative solution to this
 
01:16:17.209 --> 01:16:17.219 align:start position:0%
situation are you willing to share that
 
01:16:17.219 --> 01:16:18.470 align:start position:0%
situation are you willing to share that
um

01:16:18.470 --> 01:16:18.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:16:18.480 --> 01:16:19.970 align:start position:0%
um
that

01:16:19.970 --> 01:16:19.980 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:16:22.669 --> 01:16:22.679 align:start position:0%
Prospect with us at this time or would
 
01:16:23.750 --> 01:16:23.760 align:start position:0%
that be
 
01:16:25.790 --> 01:16:25.800 align:start position:0%
um do you think that would be sort of
 
01:16:27.590 --> 01:16:27.600 align:start position:0%
premature no that's that's fine I
 
01:16:29.750 --> 01:16:29.760 align:start position:0%
appreciate the question so again a power
 
01:16:32.030 --> 01:16:32.040 align:start position:0%
purchase agreement you know at least
 
01:16:34.250 --> 01:16:34.260 align:start position:0%
this this one was a rank arranged at by
 
01:16:36.410 --> 01:16:36.420 align:start position:0%
private parties White Mountain paper and
 
01:16:38.030 --> 01:16:38.040 align:start position:0%
Brookfield Renewable I understand that
 
01:16:39.649 --> 01:16:39.659 align:start position:0%
discussions have been going and I
 
01:16:40.729 --> 01:16:40.739 align:start position:0%
believe that there's an amendment coming
 
01:16:42.350 --> 01:16:42.360 align:start position:0%
around but you know the Department's not
 
01:16:45.350 --> 01:16:45.360 align:start position:0%
in the position to find a remedy to a
 
01:16:46.669 --> 01:16:46.679 align:start position:0%
power purchase agreement between two
 
01:16:48.770 --> 01:16:48.780 align:start position:0%
parties it's just you know we think that
 
01:16:50.390 --> 01:16:50.400 align:start position:0%
there may potentially be one through
 
01:16:52.370 --> 01:16:52.380 align:start position:0%
that route and private those two private
 
01:16:56.570 --> 01:16:56.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:59.149 --> 01:16:59.159 align:start position:0%
okay representative McGee has another
 
01:17:02.149 --> 01:17:02.159 align:start position:0%
question yes thank you
 
01:17:05.030 --> 01:17:05.040 align:start position:0%
um so my question is around the build
 
01:17:07.310 --> 01:17:07.320 align:start position:0%
out of hydro in the state because when I
 
01:17:08.510 --> 01:17:08.520 align:start position:0%
first joined the committee we had
 
01:17:11.090 --> 01:17:11.100 align:start position:0%
testimony that the hydro in the state
 
01:17:13.550 --> 01:17:13.560 align:start position:0%
was pretty much built out so I just
 
01:17:16.010 --> 01:17:16.020 align:start position:0%
wanted to say that here in the hearing
 
01:17:18.830 --> 01:17:18.840 align:start position:0%
and also I wondered if you would comment
 
01:17:22.010 --> 01:17:22.020 align:start position:0%
on whether you think Hydro is in a
 
01:17:24.110 --> 01:17:24.120 align:start position:0%
you know a different category in terms
 
01:17:26.810 --> 01:17:26.820 align:start position:0%
of Renewables because it provides steady
 
01:17:29.930 --> 01:17:29.940 align:start position:0%
state energy and you know it can be
 
01:17:33.169 --> 01:17:33.179 align:start position:0%
deployed when needed so it's kind of
 
01:17:35.149 --> 01:17:35.159 align:start position:0%
been a kind of in a different category
 
01:17:37.310 --> 01:17:37.320 align:start position:0%
in terms of whether we're going to want
 
01:17:39.649 --> 01:17:39.659 align:start position:0%
to optimize it and and make it
 
01:17:41.750 --> 01:17:41.760 align:start position:0%
economically feasible for us to be using
 
01:17:43.490 --> 01:17:43.500 align:start position:0%
that energy
 
01:17:45.649 --> 01:17:45.659 align:start position:0%
sure so thank you for the question so I
 
01:17:46.910 --> 01:17:46.920 align:start position:0%
would certainly agree that Hydro
 
01:17:49.729 --> 01:17:49.739 align:start position:0%
electric power is certainly renewable
 
01:17:52.010 --> 01:17:52.020 align:start position:0%
um you know it certainly has you know
 
01:17:54.050 --> 01:17:54.060 align:start position:0%
higher capacity factors compared to
 
01:17:56.030 --> 01:17:56.040 align:start position:0%
other types of renewable energy sources
 
01:17:58.729 --> 01:17:58.739 align:start position:0%
whether or not you know policy makers
 
01:18:01.430 --> 01:18:01.440 align:start position:0%
feel the need to further incentivize a
 
01:18:03.470 --> 01:18:03.480 align:start position:0%
hydroelectric generation in the state or
 
01:18:06.050 --> 01:18:06.060 align:start position:0%
you know make policy changes for them
 
01:18:07.669 --> 01:18:07.679 align:start position:0%
that's obviously decisions for this
 
01:18:09.530 --> 01:18:09.540 align:start position:0%
committee to make but obviously as
 
01:18:10.910 --> 01:18:10.920 align:start position:0%
Department of energy we certainly want
 
01:18:13.669 --> 01:18:13.679 align:start position:0%
to provide our input as is directed
 
01:18:16.250 --> 01:18:16.260 align:start position:0%
obviously the legislatures under statute
 
01:18:18.770 --> 01:18:18.780 align:start position:0%
thank you okay
 
01:18:21.169 --> 01:18:21.179 align:start position:0%
okay seeing no further questions from
 
01:18:22.850 --> 01:18:22.860 align:start position:0%
the committee we want to thank you for
 
01:18:25.310 --> 01:18:25.320 align:start position:0%
your testimony thank you Robert and I'll
 
01:18:27.530 --> 01:18:27.540 align:start position:0%
call next on Heidi Kroll
 
01:18:30.590 --> 01:18:30.600 align:start position:0%
who is representing Brookfield Renewable
 
01:18:34.130 --> 01:18:34.140 align:start position:0%
and manadnock paper mills and needs
 
01:18:36.110 --> 01:18:36.120 align:start position:0%
about seven or eight minutes to discuss
 
01:18:36.120 --> 01:18:37.729 align:start position:0%
about seven or eight minutes to discuss
uh

01:18:37.729 --> 01:18:37.739 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:18:40.729 --> 01:18:40.739 align:start position:0%
the bill and maybe some potential
 
01:18:42.950 --> 01:18:42.960 align:start position:0%
changes to it
 
01:18:45.590 --> 01:18:45.600 align:start position:0%
Ms Grove welcome good morning Mr
 
01:18:47.090 --> 01:18:47.100 align:start position:0%
chairman and members of the committee
 
01:18:49.250 --> 01:18:49.260 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is Heidi Kroll I
 
01:18:51.310 --> 01:18:51.320 align:start position:0%
work at Gallagher Callahan and gartrell
 
01:18:53.689 --> 01:18:53.699 align:start position:0%
and I'm here today representing a
 
01:18:55.729 --> 01:18:55.739 align:start position:0%
Brookfield Renewable as well as
 
01:18:58.070 --> 01:18:58.080 align:start position:0%
Monadnock paper mills which is a family
 
01:18:58.080 --> 01:18:59.110 align:start position:0%
Monadnock paper mills which is a family
owned

01:18:59.110 --> 01:18:59.120 align:start position:0%
owned
 
01:19:01.490 --> 01:19:01.500 align:start position:0%
paper mill in Bennington New Hampshire
 
01:19:03.830 --> 01:19:03.840 align:start position:0%
it happens to be the oldest continuously
 
01:19:05.870 --> 01:19:05.880 align:start position:0%
operating Mill in the United States uh
 
01:19:08.810 --> 01:19:08.820 align:start position:0%
dating back to 1819.
 
01:19:08.820 --> 01:19:10.070 align:start position:0%
dating back to 1819.
um

01:19:10.070 --> 01:19:10.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:19:13.070 --> 01:19:13.080 align:start position:0%
so sb40 so I appreciate the opportunity
 
01:19:15.290 --> 01:19:15.300 align:start position:0%
to testify here before you this morning
 
01:19:17.810 --> 01:19:17.820 align:start position:0%
um sb40 amends existing law as you've
 
01:19:22.910 --> 01:19:22.920 align:start position:0%
heard it's RSA 362 a 9 Roman 20 and it
 
01:19:25.070 --> 01:19:25.080 align:start position:0%
provides additional Clarity so that the
 
01:19:27.950 --> 01:19:27.960 align:start position:0%
law can actually be implemented this law
 
01:19:31.010 --> 01:19:31.020 align:start position:0%
was passed in 2021 with bipartisan
 
01:19:34.070 --> 01:19:34.080 align:start position:0%
support as part of SB 91
 
01:19:36.229 --> 01:19:36.239 align:start position:0%
um you may recall that SB 91 and House
 
01:19:39.770 --> 01:19:39.780 align:start position:0%
Bill 315 which was the municipal group
 
01:19:42.110 --> 01:19:42.120 align:start position:0%
net metering Bill we're signed into law
 
01:19:44.810 --> 01:19:44.820 align:start position:0%
by the governor at a signing ceremony in
 
01:19:47.390 --> 01:19:47.400 align:start position:0%
August of 2021 and I know that the
 
01:19:48.770 --> 01:19:48.780 align:start position:0%
chairman and vice chairman who were
 
01:19:50.630 --> 01:19:50.640 align:start position:0%
there in attendance
 
01:19:53.570 --> 01:19:53.580 align:start position:0%
um so the the hydro provision in SB 91
 
01:19:56.030 --> 01:19:56.040 align:start position:0%
was intended to essentially level the
 
01:19:58.130 --> 01:19:58.140 align:start position:0%
playing field for Monadnock paper mills
 
01:20:01.189 --> 01:20:01.199 align:start position:0%
and Brookfield and I know Steve is ready
 
01:20:02.930 --> 01:20:02.940 align:start position:0%
from Brookfield who's with me today can
 
01:20:05.510 --> 01:20:05.520 align:start position:0%
speak to the testimony that they did
 
01:20:09.050 --> 01:20:09.060 align:start position:0%
give in support of SB 91 both I believe
 
01:20:10.970 --> 01:20:10.980 align:start position:0%
there's oral testimonies as well as
 
01:20:12.590 --> 01:20:12.600 align:start position:0%
written testimony
 
01:20:12.600 --> 01:20:13.310 align:start position:0%
written testimony
um

01:20:13.310 --> 01:20:13.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:16.189 --> 01:20:16.199 align:start position:0%
so so the provision in SB 91 was
 
01:20:17.810 --> 01:20:17.820 align:start position:0%
intended to level the playing field for
 
01:20:19.729 --> 01:20:19.739 align:start position:0%
Monadnock paper mills and Brookfield so
 
01:20:21.830 --> 01:20:21.840 align:start position:0%
that their Hydro facilities those that
 
01:20:24.530 --> 01:20:24.540 align:start position:0%
are under five megawatts are allowed to
 
01:20:26.270 --> 01:20:26.280 align:start position:0%
participate in net metering just like
 
01:20:28.370 --> 01:20:28.380 align:start position:0%
any other New Hampshire Hydro facility
 
01:20:30.890 --> 01:20:30.900 align:start position:0%
is already allowed to when they're under
 
01:20:34.610 --> 01:20:34.620 align:start position:0%
five megawatts so in passing SB 91 the
 
01:20:36.709 --> 01:20:36.719 align:start position:0%
legislature recognized that these are
 
01:20:39.470 --> 01:20:39.480 align:start position:0%
local run of river base load Hydro
 
01:20:40.970 --> 01:20:40.980 align:start position:0%
facilities that are important to
 
01:20:43.669 --> 01:20:43.679 align:start position:0%
reliability among other things and the
 
01:20:45.470 --> 01:20:45.480 align:start position:0%
legislature also recognized that these
 
01:20:48.470 --> 01:20:48.480 align:start position:0%
hydros meet the eligibility requirements
 
01:20:51.470 --> 01:20:51.480 align:start position:0%
for net metering but for the fact that
 
01:20:53.570 --> 01:20:53.580 align:start position:0%
they have Legacy wiring issues that
 
01:20:56.149 --> 01:20:56.159 align:start position:0%
require additional statutory guidance
 
01:20:58.550 --> 01:20:58.560 align:start position:0%
and the legislature recognized that it
 
01:21:01.370 --> 01:21:01.380 align:start position:0%
would really be unfair to exclude these
 
01:21:03.890 --> 01:21:03.900 align:start position:0%
two hydrocytes simply because of this
 
01:21:06.830 --> 01:21:06.840 align:start position:0%
Legacy wiring so what is the Legacy
 
01:21:10.250 --> 01:21:10.260 align:start position:0%
wiring issue at each site both at
 
01:21:11.630 --> 01:21:11.640 align:start position:0%
Monadnock paper mills and at the
 
01:21:13.790 --> 01:21:13.800 align:start position:0%
Brookfield site there are mult multiple
 
01:21:16.430 --> 01:21:16.440 align:start position:0%
Hydro facilities that share a single
 
01:21:18.350 --> 01:21:18.360 align:start position:0%
interconnection point with the grid
 
01:21:21.970 --> 01:21:21.980 align:start position:0%
namely through the on-site paper mills
 
01:21:25.669 --> 01:21:25.679 align:start position:0%
today no new renewable facilities would
 
01:21:28.370 --> 01:21:28.380 align:start position:0%
be wired to the Grid in this way but
 
01:21:30.169 --> 01:21:30.179 align:start position:0%
that's just how it was done when these
 
01:21:31.910 --> 01:21:31.920 align:start position:0%
Hydro facilities were first built to
 
01:21:34.610 --> 01:21:34.620 align:start position:0%
power these Mills many many decades ago
 
01:21:36.770 --> 01:21:36.780 align:start position:0%
and the analogy I would give you is that
 
01:21:38.870 --> 01:21:38.880 align:start position:0%
the wiring that you find in an antique
 
01:21:41.510 --> 01:21:41.520 align:start position:0%
home would not be how you would wire a
 
01:21:44.149 --> 01:21:44.159 align:start position:0%
house if you were building it today
 
01:21:48.290 --> 01:21:48.300 align:start position:0%
so despite passage of SB 91 around 20
 
01:21:51.530 --> 01:21:51.540 align:start position:0%
months ago to date neither Monadnock
 
01:21:53.689 --> 01:21:53.699 align:start position:0%
paper mills nor Brookfield have been
 
01:21:55.729 --> 01:21:55.739 align:start position:0%
able to actually use the law to knit
 
01:22:00.050 --> 01:22:00.060 align:start position:0%
meter the language in sb40 is needed so
 
01:22:03.070 --> 01:22:03.080 align:start position:0%
that the law can actually work
 
01:22:06.070 --> 01:22:06.080 align:start position:0%
sb40 will ensure a couple of key things
 
01:22:09.050 --> 01:22:09.060 align:start position:0%
first of all that only monadnox and
 
01:22:11.270 --> 01:22:11.280 align:start position:0%
brookfield's Hydra facilities that are
 
01:22:13.610 --> 01:22:13.620 align:start position:0%
under five megawatts will be allowed to
 
01:22:15.890 --> 01:22:15.900 align:start position:0%
participate in net metering that any
 
01:22:18.050 --> 01:22:18.060 align:start position:0%
other on-site generation or energy
 
01:22:21.169 --> 01:22:21.179 align:start position:0%
storage will not be able to participate
 
01:22:23.689 --> 01:22:23.699 align:start position:0%
and it finally makes clear that it's
 
01:22:26.209 --> 01:22:26.219 align:start position:0%
we're only talking about the excess
 
01:22:28.810 --> 01:22:28.820 align:start position:0%
generation from the eligible facilities
 
01:22:32.570 --> 01:22:32.580 align:start position:0%
after the on-site Mills power needs are
 
01:22:35.209 --> 01:22:35.219 align:start position:0%
met only that excess will will be
 
01:22:37.610 --> 01:22:37.620 align:start position:0%
eligible to participate
 
01:22:39.830 --> 01:22:39.840 align:start position:0%
um so again with respect to the excess
 
01:22:42.229 --> 01:22:42.239 align:start position:0%
you may be aware that
 
01:22:45.350 --> 01:22:45.360 align:start position:0%
um municipalities schools counties and
 
01:22:47.450 --> 01:22:47.460 align:start position:0%
the state have had a lot of interest in
 
01:22:49.189 --> 01:22:49.199 align:start position:0%
group net metering with small New
 
01:22:51.830 --> 01:22:51.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Hydro beginning years ago when
 
01:22:53.990 --> 01:22:54.000 align:start position:0%
Hydro facilities of one megawatt or less
 
01:22:56.330 --> 01:22:56.340 align:start position:0%
were allowed to net meter and continuing
 
01:22:59.149 --> 01:22:59.159 align:start position:0%
with the passage of House Bill 315 and
 
01:23:01.270 --> 01:23:01.280 align:start position:0%
the municipal group net metering program
 
01:23:03.890 --> 01:23:03.900 align:start position:0%
where political subdivisions and the
 
01:23:05.689 --> 01:23:05.699 align:start position:0%
state can group net meter with
 
01:23:08.590 --> 01:23:08.600 align:start position:0%
facilities up to five megawatts
 
01:23:10.729 --> 01:23:10.739 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that there's
 
01:23:12.709 --> 01:23:12.719 align:start position:0%
currently actually not enough small
 
01:23:16.030 --> 01:23:16.040 align:start position:0%
Hydro available to meet the demand
 
01:23:19.610 --> 01:23:19.620 align:start position:0%
in the municipal group net metering
 
01:23:22.370 --> 01:23:22.380 align:start position:0%
program the demand from the various
 
01:23:24.350 --> 01:23:24.360 align:start position:0%
political entities in the state for
 
01:23:28.790 --> 01:23:28.800 align:start position:0%
hydro so sb40 will make a small but I
 
01:23:31.070 --> 01:23:31.080 align:start position:0%
think meaningful amount of additional
 
01:23:33.830 --> 01:23:33.840 align:start position:0%
base load hydropower available to the
 
01:23:36.950 --> 01:23:36.960 align:start position:0%
municipal group net metering program and
 
01:23:39.169 --> 01:23:39.179 align:start position:0%
for those municipalities counties and
 
01:23:40.729 --> 01:23:40.739 align:start position:0%
the state entities that are waiting for
 
01:23:43.189 --> 01:23:43.199 align:start position:0%
more supply of hydro this modest Edition
 
01:23:46.790 --> 01:23:46.800 align:start position:0%
I think would be welcome to them
 
01:23:49.070 --> 01:23:49.080 align:start position:0%
so as I mentioned um you know that
 
01:23:50.630 --> 01:23:50.640 align:start position:0%
neither Monadnock paper mills or
 
01:23:52.370 --> 01:23:52.380 align:start position:0%
Brickfield have been able to net meter
 
01:23:54.410 --> 01:23:54.420 align:start position:0%
under the current law and the reason
 
01:23:58.189 --> 01:23:58.199 align:start position:0%
that is after the passage of SB 91 when
 
01:24:00.530 --> 01:24:00.540 align:start position:0%
both entities reached out to eversource
 
01:24:03.110 --> 01:24:03.120 align:start position:0%
to start the process to participate in
 
01:24:05.990 --> 01:24:06.000 align:start position:0%
net metering two issues were raised as
 
01:24:07.490 --> 01:24:07.500 align:start position:0%
needing additional guidance from the
 
01:24:10.070 --> 01:24:10.080 align:start position:0%
legislature and that guidance is found
 
01:24:13.729 --> 01:24:13.739 align:start position:0%
in sb40 so the first issue is that on
 
01:24:15.590 --> 01:24:15.600 align:start position:0%
both the Monadnock site and the
 
01:24:18.350 --> 01:24:18.360 align:start position:0%
Brookfield site there are generators
 
01:24:20.810 --> 01:24:20.820 align:start position:0%
that are eligible for net metering there
 
01:24:23.330 --> 01:24:23.340 align:start position:0%
are also a few generators that are not
 
01:24:25.250 --> 01:24:25.260 align:start position:0%
eligible for net metering and so the
 
01:24:27.830 --> 01:24:27.840 align:start position:0%
issue is that we need a methodology to
 
01:24:30.890 --> 01:24:30.900 align:start position:0%
separate out what is the eligible excess
 
01:24:33.050 --> 01:24:33.060 align:start position:0%
generation from the ineligible excess
 
01:24:35.330 --> 01:24:35.340 align:start position:0%
generation to determine how much is
 
01:24:36.950 --> 01:24:36.960 align:start position:0%
allowed to go into the net metering
 
01:24:36.960 --> 01:24:37.689 align:start position:0%
allowed to go into the net metering
program

01:24:37.689 --> 01:24:37.699 align:start position:0%
program
 
01:24:40.850 --> 01:24:40.860 align:start position:0%
so a few details on that in the case of
 
01:24:43.790 --> 01:24:43.800 align:start position:0%
Monadnock paper mills they have a steam
 
01:24:46.189 --> 01:24:46.199 align:start position:0%
generator a steam turbine on-site that
 
01:24:48.410 --> 01:24:48.420 align:start position:0%
runs off of waste heat from the mill
 
01:24:51.950 --> 01:24:51.960 align:start position:0%
when the mill is running that steam
 
01:24:55.070 --> 01:24:55.080 align:start position:0%
turbine runs as well and they use all of
 
01:24:57.649 --> 01:24:57.659 align:start position:0%
their hydroelectric power as well to run
 
01:24:59.870 --> 01:24:59.880 align:start position:0%
their Mill and in addition they bought
 
01:25:01.610 --> 01:25:01.620 align:start position:0%
that meets about 50 percent of their
 
01:25:03.410 --> 01:25:03.420 align:start position:0%
needs and they buy the other 50 percent
 
01:25:06.169 --> 01:25:06.179 align:start position:0%
from the competitive market
 
01:25:08.810 --> 01:25:08.820 align:start position:0%
um in the case of monadnoc they would be
 
01:25:10.310 --> 01:25:10.320 align:start position:0%
net metering their excess
 
01:25:12.490 --> 01:25:12.500 align:start position:0%
hydrogeneration when they're not running
 
01:25:16.250 --> 01:25:16.260 align:start position:0%
evenings weekends holidays the steam
 
01:25:18.169 --> 01:25:18.179 align:start position:0%
turbine would not be running obviously
 
01:25:20.330 --> 01:25:20.340 align:start position:0%
the if the Mill's not running there's no
 
01:25:24.110 --> 01:25:24.120 align:start position:0%
steam um no waste heat but nonetheless
 
01:25:26.689 --> 01:25:26.699 align:start position:0%
um eversource was looking for
 
01:25:26.699 --> 01:25:27.410 align:start position:0%
um eversource was looking for
um

01:25:27.410 --> 01:25:27.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:25:29.149 --> 01:25:29.159 align:start position:0%
just assurances kind of belts and
 
01:25:30.649 --> 01:25:30.659 align:start position:0%
suspenders to make sure that there's a
 
01:25:33.290 --> 01:25:33.300 align:start position:0%
methodology to absolutely demonstrate
 
01:25:36.110 --> 01:25:36.120 align:start position:0%
that there is any excess generation
 
01:25:37.910 --> 01:25:37.920 align:start position:0%
that's going out onto the grid is only
 
01:25:40.370 --> 01:25:40.380 align:start position:0%
coming from the eligible facilities and
 
01:25:42.530 --> 01:25:42.540 align:start position:0%
not from the steam turbine
 
01:25:45.709 --> 01:25:45.719 align:start position:0%
in the case of Brookfield there are four
 
01:25:47.870 --> 01:25:47.880 align:start position:0%
hydros on site that are under five
 
01:25:51.649 --> 01:25:51.659 align:start position:0%
megawatts and so eligible for the
 
01:25:54.189 --> 01:25:54.199 align:start position:0%
municipal group net metering program
 
01:25:56.689 --> 01:25:56.699 align:start position:0%
and there are also two hydros there that
 
01:25:58.790 --> 01:25:58.800 align:start position:0%
are slightly above five megawatts those
 
01:26:00.410 --> 01:26:00.420 align:start position:0%
are not eligible
 
01:26:03.890 --> 01:26:03.900 align:start position:0%
and so a portion of the output from the
 
01:26:07.010 --> 01:26:07.020 align:start position:0%
Brookfield Hydro facilities is used to
 
01:26:09.410 --> 01:26:09.420 align:start position:0%
serve White Mountain paper under a
 
01:26:12.050 --> 01:26:12.060 align:start position:0%
long-term purchase power agreement as
 
01:26:15.169 --> 01:26:15.179 align:start position:0%
you heard discussion of that earlier
 
01:26:17.870 --> 01:26:17.880 align:start position:0%
um so what sb40 requires of both
 
01:26:19.669 --> 01:26:19.679 align:start position:0%
Monadnock paper mills and Brookfield
 
01:26:22.490 --> 01:26:22.500 align:start position:0%
would be to follow a methodology that
 
01:26:24.709 --> 01:26:24.719 align:start position:0%
will be approved and regularly audited
 
01:26:27.050 --> 01:26:27.060 align:start position:0%
by both the department of energy and
 
01:26:29.570 --> 01:26:29.580 align:start position:0%
eversource where
 
01:26:31.790 --> 01:26:31.800 align:start position:0%
um Monada paper mills in Brookfield are
 
01:26:34.010 --> 01:26:34.020 align:start position:0%
responsible for reading the meters of
 
01:26:35.590 --> 01:26:35.600 align:start position:0%
all of the on-site generators
 
01:26:38.209 --> 01:26:38.219 align:start position:0%
documenting how much each generator is
 
01:26:40.669 --> 01:26:40.679 align:start position:0%
producing in each hour how much power is
 
01:26:43.129 --> 01:26:43.139 align:start position:0%
being used to serve the Mills on-site
 
01:26:45.890 --> 01:26:45.900 align:start position:0%
load how much excess generation is going
 
01:26:49.250 --> 01:26:49.260 align:start position:0%
on to the grid and then of that how much
 
01:26:51.350 --> 01:26:51.360 align:start position:0%
of that excess is eligible for net
 
01:26:55.850 --> 01:26:55.860 align:start position:0%
metering so sb40 lays all of this out
 
01:26:58.490 --> 01:26:58.500 align:start position:0%
and the language does reflect input that
 
01:26:59.930 --> 01:26:59.940 align:start position:0%
we got from both the department of
 
01:27:01.990 --> 01:27:02.000 align:start position:0%
energy and eversource
 
01:27:04.370 --> 01:27:04.380 align:start position:0%
to to make sure that that process is
 
01:27:05.510 --> 01:27:05.520 align:start position:0%
very clear
 
01:27:08.870 --> 01:27:08.880 align:start position:0%
the second issue that sb40 addresses is
 
01:27:11.750 --> 01:27:11.760 align:start position:0%
unique to Brookfield at the site behind
 
01:27:13.610 --> 01:27:13.620 align:start position:0%
the point of interconnection that is
 
01:27:13.620 --> 01:27:14.590 align:start position:0%
the point of interconnection that is
shared

01:27:14.590 --> 01:27:14.600 align:start position:0%
shared
 
01:27:17.090 --> 01:27:17.100 align:start position:0%
the interconnection point with the grid
 
01:27:20.270 --> 01:27:20.280 align:start position:0%
the hydros are owned by Brookfield and
 
01:27:21.649 --> 01:27:21.659 align:start position:0%
they share the interconnection point
 
01:27:23.450 --> 01:27:23.460 align:start position:0%
with the mill which is owned by White
 
01:27:25.010 --> 01:27:25.020 align:start position:0%
Mountain paper
 
01:27:26.750 --> 01:27:26.760 align:start position:0%
and as you heard White Mountain paper is
 
01:27:28.850 --> 01:27:28.860 align:start position:0%
currently the customer of record at that
 
01:27:31.070 --> 01:27:31.080 align:start position:0%
shared point of interconnection with the
 
01:27:33.050 --> 01:27:33.060 align:start position:0%
hydro facilities
 
01:27:33.060 --> 01:27:33.590 align:start position:0%
hydro facilities
um

01:27:33.590 --> 01:27:33.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:27:35.930 --> 01:27:35.940 align:start position:0%
the current law actually does have some
 
01:27:37.970 --> 01:27:37.980 align:start position:0%
language about the hydroelectric
 
01:27:40.970 --> 01:27:40.980 align:start position:0%
generator meeting other various
 
01:27:42.890 --> 01:27:42.900 align:start position:0%
requirements and it talks about that
 
01:27:44.930 --> 01:27:44.940 align:start position:0%
shares equipment or facilities with
 
01:27:47.209 --> 01:27:47.219 align:start position:0%
other generators or electric utility
 
01:27:49.370 --> 01:27:49.380 align:start position:0%
customers for interconnection to the
 
01:27:52.370 --> 01:27:52.380 align:start position:0%
grid shall be eligible to participate in
 
01:27:54.530 --> 01:27:54.540 align:start position:0%
net energy mirroring as a customer
 
01:27:58.070 --> 01:27:58.080 align:start position:0%
generator so the language is there sb40
 
01:28:01.149 --> 01:28:01.159 align:start position:0%
simply adds some clarification
 
01:28:04.610 --> 01:28:04.620 align:start position:0%
to make sure that you know everybody's
 
01:28:06.770 --> 01:28:06.780 align:start position:0%
comfortable with what's being made
 
01:28:06.780 --> 01:28:08.050 align:start position:0%
comfortable with what's being made
explicit

01:28:08.050 --> 01:28:08.060 align:start position:0%
explicit
 
01:28:11.209 --> 01:28:11.219 align:start position:0%
and really this is necessary because the
 
01:28:13.669 --> 01:28:13.679 align:start position:0%
only alternative would be very costly
 
01:28:16.370 --> 01:28:16.380 align:start position:0%
and frankly cost prohibitive uh
 
01:28:19.430 --> 01:28:19.440 align:start position:0%
infrastructure upgrades that would you
 
01:28:21.709 --> 01:28:21.719 align:start position:0%
know I think frankly run counter to the
 
01:28:24.890 --> 01:28:24.900 align:start position:0%
intent and purpose of SB 91 that was
 
01:28:24.900 --> 01:28:28.070 align:start position:0%
intent and purpose of SB 91 that was
recognized

01:28:28.070 --> 01:28:28.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:30.709 --> 01:28:30.719 align:start position:0%
so as you may recall from the hearing on
 
01:28:33.649 --> 01:28:33.659 align:start position:0%
House Bill 458 which was the sister Bill
 
01:28:36.530 --> 01:28:36.540 align:start position:0%
to sb40 White Mountain paper asked for
 
01:28:39.410 --> 01:28:39.420 align:start position:0%
some more time to review sb40 to ensure
 
01:28:41.930 --> 01:28:41.940 align:start position:0%
that there would not be any impact on
 
01:28:44.750 --> 01:28:44.760 align:start position:0%
their PPA with Brookfield and I'm happy
 
01:28:46.490 --> 01:28:46.500 align:start position:0%
to report that on Brookfield and White
 
01:28:47.750 --> 01:28:47.760 align:start position:0%
Mountain paper have worked very
 
01:28:50.209 --> 01:28:50.219 align:start position:0%
collaboratively over the last month or
 
01:28:53.030 --> 01:28:53.040 align:start position:0%
so and have reached an agreement on a
 
01:28:55.070 --> 01:28:55.080 align:start position:0%
few changes to the bill and I do have
 
01:28:56.689 --> 01:28:56.699 align:start position:0%
copies with that that I can circulate
 
01:29:00.110 --> 01:29:00.120 align:start position:0%
around to the committee as well as an
 
01:29:01.970 --> 01:29:01.980 align:start position:0%
agreement that's set forth in a sidebar
 
01:29:04.910 --> 01:29:04.920 align:start position:0%
letter and you know Brookfield has said
 
01:29:08.689 --> 01:29:08.699 align:start position:0%
all along in its past testimony on you
 
01:29:11.270 --> 01:29:11.280 align:start position:0%
know prior iterations of this bill as as
 
01:29:13.610 --> 01:29:13.620 align:start position:0%
well as the testimony on sb40 in the
 
01:29:15.709 --> 01:29:15.719 align:start position:0%
Senate has said all along that what
 
01:29:17.330 --> 01:29:17.340 align:start position:0%
they're looking for is the opportunity
 
01:29:20.450 --> 01:29:20.460 align:start position:0%
to net meter any excess generation from
 
01:29:23.209 --> 01:29:23.219 align:start position:0%
its Hydro facilities after serving White
 
01:29:26.450 --> 01:29:26.460 align:start position:0%
Mountain papers power needs and the
 
01:29:28.790 --> 01:29:28.800 align:start position:0%
proposed amendment and the sidebar let
 
01:29:31.370 --> 01:29:31.380 align:start position:0%
her clarify that commitment
 
01:29:31.380 --> 01:29:32.390 align:start position:0%
her clarify that commitment
um

01:29:32.390 --> 01:29:32.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:29:34.729 --> 01:29:34.739 align:start position:0%
finally as you know as you've heard
 
01:29:37.129 --> 01:29:37.139 align:start position:0%
earlier doe has raised some concerns
 
01:29:39.110 --> 01:29:39.120 align:start position:0%
about the customer generator part of the
 
01:29:40.970 --> 01:29:40.980 align:start position:0%
bill as being a change that could
 
01:29:43.910 --> 01:29:43.920 align:start position:0%
potentially be precedent setting and
 
01:29:45.649 --> 01:29:45.659 align:start position:0%
from our perspective there are several
 
01:29:47.570 --> 01:29:47.580 align:start position:0%
reasons why we don't think that this
 
01:29:49.550 --> 01:29:49.560 align:start position:0%
should be a concern
 
01:29:51.890 --> 01:29:51.900 align:start position:0%
um during Doe's testimony in the Senate
 
01:29:55.370 --> 01:29:55.380 align:start position:0%
on sb40 they did acknowledge that the
 
01:29:57.830 --> 01:29:57.840 align:start position:0%
bill is very narrowly written and you
 
01:29:59.629 --> 01:29:59.639 align:start position:0%
heard that from Senator Waters and and
 
01:30:02.209 --> 01:30:02.219 align:start position:0%
we would agree with that they
 
01:30:03.830 --> 01:30:03.840 align:start position:0%
acknowledged that it would only apply to
 
01:30:05.629 --> 01:30:05.639 align:start position:0%
the situation that we're we've been
 
01:30:08.030 --> 01:30:08.040 align:start position:0%
talking about here today and not apply
 
01:30:10.629 --> 01:30:10.639 align:start position:0%
to any other party without
 
01:30:13.490 --> 01:30:13.500 align:start position:0%
explicit approval by the legislature and
 
01:30:16.550 --> 01:30:16.560 align:start position:0%
passage of a future law and the final
 
01:30:18.470 --> 01:30:18.480 align:start position:0%
thing I would say is and I've said this
 
01:30:21.290 --> 01:30:21.300 align:start position:0%
once before but um no new renewable
 
01:30:23.510 --> 01:30:23.520 align:start position:0%
facility is going to interconnect to the
 
01:30:26.330 --> 01:30:26.340 align:start position:0%
grid using this type of Legacy wiring
 
01:30:28.850 --> 01:30:28.860 align:start position:0%
design that you see on these Old Mill
 
01:30:31.610 --> 01:30:31.620 align:start position:0%
sites so we don't see any concerns with
 
01:30:34.430 --> 01:30:34.440 align:start position:0%
this bill being precedent setting
 
01:30:36.770 --> 01:30:36.780 align:start position:0%
So In Sum and then I'll turn it over to
 
01:30:39.770 --> 01:30:39.780 align:start position:0%
Steve to add his um
 
01:30:39.780 --> 01:30:41.330 align:start position:0%
Steve to add his um
editions

01:30:41.330 --> 01:30:41.340 align:start position:0%
editions
 
01:30:44.390 --> 01:30:44.400 align:start position:0%
um you know sb40 is very narrow in scope
 
01:30:47.270 --> 01:30:47.280 align:start position:0%
and application it does only apply to
 
01:30:49.930 --> 01:30:49.940 align:start position:0%
two run of river base load Hydro sites
 
01:30:53.090 --> 01:30:53.100 align:start position:0%
due to their unique Legacy wiring
 
01:30:55.910 --> 01:30:55.920 align:start position:0%
situation it does not and cannot apply
 
01:30:58.490 --> 01:30:58.500 align:start position:0%
to any solar projects it does not and
 
01:31:00.050 --> 01:31:00.060 align:start position:0%
cannot apply to any facilities that
 
01:31:02.450 --> 01:31:02.460 align:start position:0%
became operational after July 1st of
 
01:31:05.510 --> 01:31:05.520 align:start position:0%
2021 and it does ensure that the power
 
01:31:08.270 --> 01:31:08.280 align:start position:0%
needs of the on-site paper mills will be
 
01:31:11.750 --> 01:31:11.760 align:start position:0%
met before any excess base load Hydro
 
01:31:14.450 --> 01:31:14.460 align:start position:0%
power is net metered so I'll turn it
 
01:31:16.010 --> 01:31:16.020 align:start position:0%
over to Steve and then we'd be happy to
 
01:31:17.810 --> 01:31:17.820 align:start position:0%
answer any questions
 
01:31:20.209 --> 01:31:20.219 align:start position:0%
exciting uh good morning Steve's already
 
01:31:22.010 --> 01:31:22.020 align:start position:0%
with Brookfield excuse me Brookfield
 
01:31:25.430 --> 01:31:25.440 align:start position:0%
Renewable uh I think Heidi outlined uh
 
01:31:27.770 --> 01:31:27.780 align:start position:0%
the history and the situation well
 
01:31:30.410 --> 01:31:30.420 align:start position:0%
um I want to First acknowledge that as
 
01:31:32.209 --> 01:31:32.219 align:start position:0%
she described we've had very productive
 
01:31:34.270 --> 01:31:34.280 align:start position:0%
conversations with white mountain paper
 
01:31:37.610 --> 01:31:37.620 align:start position:0%
uh since uh the sister bill was heard in
 
01:31:39.770 --> 01:31:39.780 align:start position:0%
the house in early February I do
 
01:31:42.830 --> 01:31:42.840 align:start position:0%
appreciate the efforts and the time of
 
01:31:44.209 --> 01:31:44.219 align:start position:0%
White Mountain paper and its
 
01:31:46.490 --> 01:31:46.500 align:start position:0%
Representatives including Mr Cousy who
 
01:31:48.709 --> 01:31:48.719 align:start position:0%
is here today the result of those
 
01:31:50.930 --> 01:31:50.940 align:start position:0%
conversations is an amendment that you
 
01:31:52.550 --> 01:31:52.560 align:start position:0%
will see I think in advance of the
 
01:31:54.410 --> 01:31:54.420 align:start position:0%
executive session on this bill and that
 
01:31:56.510 --> 01:31:56.520 align:start position:0%
really clarifies explicitly what was
 
01:31:59.570 --> 01:31:59.580 align:start position:0%
always implied in our effort here which
 
01:32:03.050 --> 01:32:03.060 align:start position:0%
is to treat only what is not being
 
01:32:06.890 --> 01:32:06.900 align:start position:0%
utilized by the mill as eligible for the
 
01:32:09.410 --> 01:32:09.420 align:start position:0%
facility and there was some suggestion
 
01:32:12.169 --> 01:32:12.179 align:start position:0%
that these are very large facilities or
 
01:32:14.709 --> 01:32:14.719 align:start position:0%
that might be a lot of Supply
 
01:32:17.750 --> 01:32:17.760 align:start position:0%
the the focus here is on facilities
 
01:32:20.510 --> 01:32:20.520 align:start position:0%
under five megawatts and the reality is
 
01:32:22.910 --> 01:32:22.920 align:start position:0%
given the the mill load what we're
 
01:32:25.250 --> 01:32:25.260 align:start position:0%
talking about in the form of Supply that
 
01:32:28.010 --> 01:32:28.020 align:start position:0%
would be eligible under any uh future
 
01:32:31.010 --> 01:32:31.020 align:start position:0%
approved methodology by the doe would
 
01:32:32.570 --> 01:32:32.580 align:start position:0%
likely to be something on the order of
 
01:32:36.050 --> 01:32:36.060 align:start position:0%
two less than five megawatt projects so
 
01:32:37.790 --> 01:32:37.800 align:start position:0%
while there's four that are under five
 
01:32:40.310 --> 01:32:40.320 align:start position:0%
megawatts these projects are serving the
 
01:32:41.990 --> 01:32:42.000 align:start position:0%
mill so we are just talking about the
 
01:32:43.729 --> 01:32:43.739 align:start position:0%
the excess here I just want to clarify
 
01:32:47.390 --> 01:32:47.400 align:start position:0%
that we did in our conversations with
 
01:32:51.070 --> 01:32:51.080 align:start position:0%
white mountain paper try to address
 
01:32:56.590 --> 01:32:56.600 align:start position:0%
Doe's stated proposal for
 
01:32:58.850 --> 01:32:58.860 align:start position:0%
kind of getting around this issue
 
01:33:00.610 --> 01:33:00.620 align:start position:0%
without legislation
 
01:33:03.350 --> 01:33:03.360 align:start position:0%
neither party in Brookfield and I think
 
01:33:05.090 --> 01:33:05.100 align:start position:0%
I can say the same for White Mountain
 
01:33:07.729 --> 01:33:07.739 align:start position:0%
paper was interested in engaging in that
 
01:33:10.189 --> 01:33:10.199 align:start position:0%
dialogue as it would require amendments
 
01:33:13.729 --> 01:33:13.739 align:start position:0%
to the existing PPA in either side wants
 
01:33:16.370 --> 01:33:16.380 align:start position:0%
to open that up for conversation so I do
 
01:33:18.950 --> 01:33:18.960 align:start position:0%
just want to make that clear uh while we
 
01:33:22.430 --> 01:33:22.440 align:start position:0%
are not a retail customer of the utility
 
01:33:24.169 --> 01:33:24.179 align:start position:0%
given the site configuration we are an
 
01:33:26.330 --> 01:33:26.340 align:start position:0%
interconnection customer of eversource
 
01:33:28.970 --> 01:33:28.980 align:start position:0%
we do have an existing relationship with
 
01:33:31.070 --> 01:33:31.080 align:start position:0%
the utility
 
01:33:32.990 --> 01:33:33.000 align:start position:0%
um I also just want to note that
 
01:33:34.250 --> 01:33:34.260 align:start position:0%
um there was some suggestion that
 
01:33:36.110 --> 01:33:36.120 align:start position:0%
Brookfield maybe wasn't considered or
 
01:33:37.850 --> 01:33:37.860 align:start position:0%
wasn't involved in in the initial
 
01:33:40.910 --> 01:33:40.920 align:start position:0%
conversations a couple years ago I did
 
01:33:42.850 --> 01:33:42.860 align:start position:0%
submit written testimony there is
 
01:33:46.790 --> 01:33:46.800 align:start position:0%
YouTube testimony it was a zoom at the
 
01:33:49.550 --> 01:33:49.560 align:start position:0%
time of a house version of of this
 
01:33:52.430 --> 01:33:52.440 align:start position:0%
policy proposal that I did testify on
 
01:33:54.770 --> 01:33:54.780 align:start position:0%
and we worked closely with Monadnock
 
01:33:56.689 --> 01:33:56.699 align:start position:0%
paper at the time on the language that
 
01:33:59.750 --> 01:33:59.760 align:start position:0%
was drafted it was anticipated given
 
01:34:03.410 --> 01:34:03.420 align:start position:0%
support for it that our issues were to
 
01:34:05.390 --> 01:34:05.400 align:start position:0%
be dealt with through that language it
 
01:34:07.790 --> 01:34:07.800 align:start position:0%
was not until we engaged directly with
 
01:34:10.189 --> 01:34:10.199 align:start position:0%
the utility and and with doe that we
 
01:34:11.810 --> 01:34:11.820 align:start position:0%
realized there were some additive
 
01:34:14.870 --> 01:34:14.880 align:start position:0%
clarifying concerns here so I'm happy to
 
01:34:17.090 --> 01:34:17.100 align:start position:0%
answer any questions but um appreciate
 
01:34:19.189 --> 01:34:19.199 align:start position:0%
everyone's time on this
 
01:34:21.470 --> 01:34:21.480 align:start position:0%
okay thank you before I open it up to
 
01:34:23.030 --> 01:34:23.040 align:start position:0%
the full committee I would like to ask a
 
01:34:25.250 --> 01:34:25.260 align:start position:0%
couple of questions myself
 
01:34:27.649 --> 01:34:27.659 align:start position:0%
the first question is
 
01:34:30.010 --> 01:34:30.020 align:start position:0%
what happens if White Mountain paper
 
01:34:31.970 --> 01:34:31.980 align:start position:0%
shuts down
 
01:34:34.430 --> 01:34:34.440 align:start position:0%
and should we add language to this
 
01:34:34.440 --> 01:34:35.810 align:start position:0%
and should we add language to this
legislation

01:34:35.810 --> 01:34:35.820 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
01:34:39.470 --> 01:34:39.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:42.169 --> 01:34:42.179 align:start position:0%
uh well that that's a future uh concern
 
01:34:44.270 --> 01:34:44.280 align:start position:0%
that I hope we don't have to deal with
 
01:34:46.490 --> 01:34:46.500 align:start position:0%
um in that case uh I think it would be
 
01:34:48.890 --> 01:34:48.900 align:start position:0%
no different than any other Hydro
 
01:34:50.570 --> 01:34:50.580 align:start position:0%
facility that participates in the
 
01:34:50.580 --> 01:34:52.070 align:start position:0%
facility that participates in the
program

01:34:52.070 --> 01:34:52.080 align:start position:0%
program
 
01:34:54.410 --> 01:34:54.420 align:start position:0%
um whereby the facilities under five
 
01:34:56.590 --> 01:34:56.600 align:start position:0%
megawatts would would qualify
 
01:34:58.729 --> 01:34:58.739 align:start position:0%
theoretically if there's no longer a
 
01:35:00.410 --> 01:35:00.420 align:start position:0%
customer there
 
01:35:03.410 --> 01:35:03.420 align:start position:0%
um then Brookfield would become the uh
 
01:35:04.970 --> 01:35:04.980 align:start position:0%
the retail customer at the point of
 
01:35:07.189 --> 01:35:07.199 align:start position:0%
interconnection but that's a future
 
01:35:09.350 --> 01:35:09.360 align:start position:0%
scenario that you know has some some
 
01:35:11.350 --> 01:35:11.360 align:start position:0%
hair around it for sure
 
01:35:16.370 --> 01:35:16.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:20.350 --> 01:35:20.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:24.830 --> 01:35:24.840 align:start position:0%
advisable or desirable to remove lines
 
01:35:32.810 --> 01:35:32.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:34.970 --> 01:35:34.980 align:start position:0%
so I think that gets to the to the
 
01:35:36.709 --> 01:35:36.719 align:start position:0%
harder the matter that we're trying to
 
01:35:38.629 --> 01:35:38.639 align:start position:0%
to solve for and that we weren't able to
 
01:35:42.229 --> 01:35:42.239 align:start position:0%
through uh private conversation as as I
 
01:35:45.830 --> 01:35:45.840 align:start position:0%
indicated and that's just the reality of
 
01:35:48.050 --> 01:35:48.060 align:start position:0%
the site configuration and Brookfield
 
01:35:50.810 --> 01:35:50.820 align:start position:0%
not having a path to being the utilities
 
01:35:53.810 --> 01:35:53.820 align:start position:0%
retail customer absent infrastructure
 
01:35:57.550 --> 01:35:57.560 align:start position:0%
changes that would be cost prohibitive
 
01:36:01.850 --> 01:36:01.860 align:start position:0%
so you think it is essential that the
 
01:36:03.770 --> 01:36:03.780 align:start position:0%
definition of customer generator be
 
01:36:06.050 --> 01:36:06.060 align:start position:0%
altered to
 
01:36:08.090 --> 01:36:08.100 align:start position:0%
move this legislation or move this
 
01:36:09.709 --> 01:36:09.719 align:start position:0%
process forward
 
01:36:11.810 --> 01:36:11.820 align:start position:0%
it is I mean there's there's language as
 
01:36:13.790 --> 01:36:13.800 align:start position:0%
I mentioned in my testimony if you look
 
01:36:15.530 --> 01:36:15.540 align:start position:0%
further up
 
01:36:19.010 --> 01:36:19.020 align:start position:0%
um the original SB 91 language if you
 
01:36:20.390 --> 01:36:20.400 align:start position:0%
will where it talks about a
 
01:36:22.550 --> 01:36:22.560 align:start position:0%
hydroelectric generator and has a
 
01:36:25.729 --> 01:36:25.739 align:start position:0%
variety of conditions and it goes on to
 
01:36:27.830 --> 01:36:27.840 align:start position:0%
say that shares equipment or facilities
 
01:36:30.290 --> 01:36:30.300 align:start position:0%
with other generators we're adding in
 
01:36:32.209 --> 01:36:32.219 align:start position:0%
energy storage facilities there are no
 
01:36:34.189 --> 01:36:34.199 align:start position:0%
energy for storage facilities currently
 
01:36:36.350 --> 01:36:36.360 align:start position:0%
at the Brookfield or Monadnock site but
 
01:36:38.330 --> 01:36:38.340 align:start position:0%
in the future there could be we're
 
01:36:39.290 --> 01:36:39.300 align:start position:0%
talking about what's being
 
01:36:41.330 --> 01:36:41.340 align:start position:0%
interconnected so that shares equipment
 
01:36:42.830 --> 01:36:42.840 align:start position:0%
or facilities with other generators
 
01:36:44.930 --> 01:36:44.940 align:start position:0%
energy storage facilities or electric
 
01:36:47.270 --> 01:36:47.280 align:start position:0%
utility customers so it says say
 
01:36:49.189 --> 01:36:49.199 align:start position:0%
electric utility customers for
 
01:36:51.590 --> 01:36:51.600 align:start position:0%
interconnection to the grid shall be
 
01:36:53.629 --> 01:36:53.639 align:start position:0%
eligible to participate in net energy
 
01:36:57.290 --> 01:36:57.300 align:start position:0%
metering as a customer generator so that
 
01:37:00.050 --> 01:37:00.060 align:start position:0%
language was already there in the
 
01:37:02.930 --> 01:37:02.940 align:start position:0%
original bill but the the feeling was
 
01:37:04.910 --> 01:37:04.920 align:start position:0%
that it needed clarification so the
 
01:37:06.770 --> 01:37:06.780 align:start position:0%
lines that you refer to Mr chairman
 
01:37:09.470 --> 01:37:09.480 align:start position:0%
provide that clarification
 
01:37:11.330 --> 01:37:11.340 align:start position:0%
all right thank you representative
 
01:37:13.790 --> 01:37:13.800 align:start position:0%
Thomas has a question thank you Mr chair
 
01:37:13.800 --> 01:37:14.930 align:start position:0%
Thomas has a question thank you Mr chair
that's

01:37:14.930 --> 01:37:14.940 align:start position:0%
that's
 
01:37:16.970 --> 01:37:16.980 align:start position:0%
very close to the question I was going
 
01:37:19.010 --> 01:37:19.020 align:start position:0%
to ask but I'm going to ask it
 
01:37:19.020 --> 01:37:21.189 align:start position:0%
to ask but I'm going to ask it
differently

01:37:21.189 --> 01:37:21.199 align:start position:0%
differently
 
01:37:24.050 --> 01:37:24.060 align:start position:0%
would you be amenable
 
01:37:28.850 --> 01:37:28.860 align:start position:0%
in your amendment to work with doe on
 
01:37:33.290 --> 01:37:33.300 align:start position:0%
lines 12 through 15 to reword them in a
 
01:37:36.649 --> 01:37:36.659 align:start position:0%
manner that would allay their fears on
 
01:37:38.750 --> 01:37:38.760 align:start position:0%
on what they expressed because that
 
01:37:41.830 --> 01:37:41.840 align:start position:0%
appears to be a major concern to them
 
01:37:45.229 --> 01:37:45.239 align:start position:0%
the rest of the bill is fine so a
 
01:37:47.990 --> 01:37:48.000 align:start position:0%
rewording that might further explain
 
01:37:50.870 --> 01:37:50.880 align:start position:0%
what it won't include in the future
 
01:37:53.149 --> 01:37:53.159 align:start position:0%
maybe or something of that nature would
 
01:37:55.490 --> 01:37:55.500 align:start position:0%
you be willing to do that in your
 
01:37:58.129 --> 01:37:58.139 align:start position:0%
Amendment sure I mean we're always happy
 
01:38:00.110 --> 01:38:00.120 align:start position:0%
to try to work with the interested
 
01:38:02.990 --> 01:38:03.000 align:start position:0%
parties and we have um you know worked
 
01:38:05.510 --> 01:38:05.520 align:start position:0%
with doe on on this bill
 
01:38:07.850 --> 01:38:07.860 align:start position:0%
um over the uh the time that it's been
 
01:38:09.169 --> 01:38:09.179 align:start position:0%
in development
 
01:38:11.810 --> 01:38:11.820 align:start position:0%
um I think really the issue is that
 
01:38:13.370 --> 01:38:13.380 align:start position:0%
um it's a difference of opinion about
 
01:38:15.410 --> 01:38:15.420 align:start position:0%
whether this is precedent setting or not
 
01:38:18.050 --> 01:38:18.060 align:start position:0%
and I did mention that in in my
 
01:38:21.410 --> 01:38:21.420 align:start position:0%
testimony where um uh you know they did
 
01:38:23.990 --> 01:38:24.000 align:start position:0%
even in the Senate when sb40 was being
 
01:38:26.030 --> 01:38:26.040 align:start position:0%
heard they did acknowledge that this is
 
01:38:28.070 --> 01:38:28.080 align:start position:0%
a very narrowly written Bill we've done
 
01:38:29.930 --> 01:38:29.940 align:start position:0%
that intentionally
 
01:38:32.510 --> 01:38:32.520 align:start position:0%
um to to try to allay the fears
 
01:38:34.850 --> 01:38:34.860 align:start position:0%
um or the concerns they acknowledge that
 
01:38:36.350 --> 01:38:36.360 align:start position:0%
it would only apply to the situation
 
01:38:38.870 --> 01:38:38.880 align:start position:0%
that we've been talking about and you
 
01:38:41.450 --> 01:38:41.460 align:start position:0%
know here today and that um you know
 
01:38:43.070 --> 01:38:43.080 align:start position:0%
anything in the future would require
 
01:38:45.470 --> 01:38:45.480 align:start position:0%
legislative approval and passage of a
 
01:38:48.050 --> 01:38:48.060 align:start position:0%
law and as I mentioned too
 
01:38:49.750 --> 01:38:49.760 align:start position:0%
um you know
 
01:38:52.970 --> 01:38:52.980 align:start position:0%
this is the whole Crux of all of this is
 
01:38:54.830 --> 01:38:54.840 align:start position:0%
that we have just these Legacy wiring
 
01:38:57.729 --> 01:38:57.739 align:start position:0%
situations at these two Old Mill sites
 
01:39:02.090 --> 01:39:02.100 align:start position:0%
no one in today's world if they were
 
01:39:03.709 --> 01:39:03.719 align:start position:0%
building something a new renewable
 
01:39:06.770 --> 01:39:06.780 align:start position:0%
facility would ever dream I think to to
 
01:39:06.780 --> 01:39:07.850 align:start position:0%
facility would ever dream I think to to
wire

01:39:07.850 --> 01:39:07.860 align:start position:0%
wire
 
01:39:09.890 --> 01:39:09.900 align:start position:0%
um you know Connect into the grid using
 
01:39:11.750 --> 01:39:11.760 align:start position:0%
this type of approach
 
01:39:14.270 --> 01:39:14.280 align:start position:0%
um so you know we're happy to continue
 
01:39:17.030 --> 01:39:17.040 align:start position:0%
to work with doe but um I think it might
 
01:39:19.010 --> 01:39:19.020 align:start position:0%
just be a a difference of opinion about
 
01:39:20.510 --> 01:39:20.520 align:start position:0%
why do you think it's precedent setting
 
01:39:21.350 --> 01:39:21.360 align:start position:0%
or not
 
01:39:24.830 --> 01:39:24.840 align:start position:0%
follow up uh thank you
 
01:39:26.810 --> 01:39:26.820 align:start position:0%
I agree it could be a difference of
 
01:39:28.750 --> 01:39:28.760 align:start position:0%
opinion but perhaps
 
01:39:31.790 --> 01:39:31.800 align:start position:0%
would you still like to look at some
 
01:39:35.510 --> 01:39:35.520 align:start position:0%
wording that might you know maybe a few
 
01:39:37.129 --> 01:39:37.139 align:start position:0%
more words to allay the difference of
 
01:39:38.990 --> 01:39:39.000 align:start position:0%
opinions so both sides agree that we
 
01:39:40.610 --> 01:39:40.620 align:start position:0%
have no difference of opinion we're
 
01:39:42.430 --> 01:39:42.440 align:start position:0%
happy to do that yes thank you
 
01:39:45.110 --> 01:39:45.120 align:start position:0%
representative partial has a question
 
01:39:46.490 --> 01:39:46.500 align:start position:0%
thank you chair and thanks for being
 
01:39:48.290 --> 01:39:48.300 align:start position:0%
here today
 
01:39:49.850 --> 01:39:49.860 align:start position:0%
um you mentioned Legacy wiring a couple
 
01:39:52.669 --> 01:39:52.679 align:start position:0%
times and my question is
 
01:39:55.270 --> 01:39:55.280 align:start position:0%
if you were able if we were
 
01:39:58.010 --> 01:39:58.020 align:start position:0%
economically feasible to replace that
 
01:39:59.870 --> 01:39:59.880 align:start position:0%
Legacy wiring would that go any distance
 
01:40:04.070 --> 01:40:04.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:05.870 --> 01:40:05.880 align:start position:0%
um I think I'll let Steve answer that
 
01:40:05.880 --> 01:40:06.890 align:start position:0%
um I think I'll let Steve answer that
question

01:40:06.890 --> 01:40:06.900 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:40:10.189 --> 01:40:10.199 align:start position:0%
yeah the reality is is that the the
 
01:40:12.410 --> 01:40:12.420 align:start position:0%
reason there is no path to to work
 
01:40:14.570 --> 01:40:14.580 align:start position:0%
around this configuration is the fact
 
01:40:17.689 --> 01:40:17.699 align:start position:0%
that doing so would require investment
 
01:40:20.390 --> 01:40:20.400 align:start position:0%
that would not make economic sense for
 
01:40:21.550 --> 01:40:21.560 align:start position:0%
for the site
 
01:40:23.870 --> 01:40:23.880 align:start position:0%
no follow-up thanks
 
01:40:26.510 --> 01:40:26.520 align:start position:0%
representative munz has a question thank
 
01:40:28.010 --> 01:40:28.020 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and thank you both for
 
01:40:29.090 --> 01:40:29.100 align:start position:0%
coming here
 
01:40:31.610 --> 01:40:31.620 align:start position:0%
um two two-part question
 
01:40:35.390 --> 01:40:35.400 align:start position:0%
um I I'm I'm assuming that white
 
01:40:35.400 --> 01:40:36.590 align:start position:0%
um I I'm I'm assuming that white
mountain

01:40:36.590 --> 01:40:36.600 align:start position:0%
mountain
 
01:40:39.649 --> 01:40:39.659 align:start position:0%
would qualify as a as a custom generator
 
01:40:41.930 --> 01:40:41.940 align:start position:0%
or a customer generator and would be
 
01:40:44.149 --> 01:40:44.159 align:start position:0%
able to get the benefit of net metering
 
01:40:50.570 --> 01:40:50.580 align:start position:0%
if that's the case why why why can't you
 
01:40:53.270 --> 01:40:53.280 align:start position:0%
and White Mountain work out or amend
 
01:40:55.010 --> 01:40:55.020 align:start position:0%
your power purchase agreement or create
 
01:40:57.550 --> 01:40:57.560 align:start position:0%
some other agreement that essentially
 
01:41:00.350 --> 01:41:00.360 align:start position:0%
has them collecting the benefit and then
 
01:41:02.090 --> 01:41:02.100 align:start position:0%
transferring that to you why do we need
 
01:41:03.950 --> 01:41:03.960 align:start position:0%
to go through this elaborate process of
 
01:41:05.930 --> 01:41:05.940 align:start position:0%
amending legislation yeah thanks for the
 
01:41:07.870 --> 01:41:07.880 align:start position:0%
question actually that's what we we did
 
01:41:10.330 --> 01:41:10.340 align:start position:0%
discuss that in our
 
01:41:12.169 --> 01:41:12.179 align:start position:0%
interactions with white mountain paper
 
01:41:14.510 --> 01:41:14.520 align:start position:0%
as that was a recommendation from the
 
01:41:18.669 --> 01:41:18.679 align:start position:0%
doe as I indicated you know addressing
 
01:41:21.530 --> 01:41:21.540 align:start position:0%
changes to the existing agreements is
 
01:41:23.510 --> 01:41:23.520 align:start position:0%
not something that either side feels
 
01:41:25.189 --> 01:41:25.199 align:start position:0%
comfortable with and and certainly
 
01:41:27.950 --> 01:41:27.960 align:start position:0%
adding some administrative complexity
 
01:41:30.229 --> 01:41:30.239 align:start position:0%
for the mill is not something that that
 
01:41:32.990 --> 01:41:33.000 align:start position:0%
we're seeking to to implement so it's
 
01:41:34.189 --> 01:41:34.199 align:start position:0%
just a lot more streamlined for
 
01:41:37.430 --> 01:41:37.440 align:start position:0%
Brookfield the dam owners to be able to
 
01:41:39.890 --> 01:41:39.900 align:start position:0%
interact with the utility for
 
01:41:39.900 --> 01:41:41.510 align:start position:0%
interact with the utility for
participation

01:41:41.510 --> 01:41:41.520 align:start position:0%
participation
 
01:41:44.649 --> 01:41:44.659 align:start position:0%
and I might just add if I could
 
01:41:48.649 --> 01:41:48.659 align:start position:0%
as part of the the methodology and the
 
01:41:50.510 --> 01:41:50.520 align:start position:0%
auditing that's been proposed that's
 
01:41:52.910 --> 01:41:52.920 align:start position:0%
also something that Brookfield uh would
 
01:41:55.850 --> 01:41:55.860 align:start position:0%
would take on itself so we would work
 
01:41:57.950 --> 01:41:57.960 align:start position:0%
with the doe and with the utility but
 
01:41:59.390 --> 01:41:59.400 align:start position:0%
all of the administrative complexities
 
01:42:01.070 --> 01:42:01.080 align:start position:0%
and whatnot would be managed by uh
 
01:42:03.770 --> 01:42:03.780 align:start position:0%
follow-up follow-up
 
01:42:05.870 --> 01:42:05.880 align:start position:0%
on that last Point
 
01:42:05.880 --> 01:42:06.649 align:start position:0%
on that last Point
um

01:42:06.649 --> 01:42:06.659 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:42:08.870 --> 01:42:08.880 align:start position:0%
you you said you're going to be willing
 
01:42:13.070 --> 01:42:13.080 align:start position:0%
to take all that on yet on um page two
 
01:42:16.090 --> 01:42:16.100 align:start position:0%
of the amendment in lines
 
01:42:19.910 --> 01:42:19.920 align:start position:0%
eight through ten through nine it says
 
01:42:23.750 --> 01:42:23.760 align:start position:0%
that the cost of recovering those the
 
01:42:25.250 --> 01:42:25.260 align:start position:0%
the that the recovery of those
 
01:42:29.330 --> 01:42:29.340 align:start position:0%
incremental uh manual billing process
 
01:42:31.910 --> 01:42:31.920 align:start position:0%
will be passed on to utility customers
 
01:42:34.669 --> 01:42:34.679 align:start position:0%
so so that was language requested by
 
01:42:34.679 --> 01:42:35.990 align:start position:0%
so so that was language requested by
eversource

01:42:35.990 --> 01:42:36.000 align:start position:0%
eversource
 
01:42:37.850 --> 01:42:37.860 align:start position:0%
um so we're not certain you know the
 
01:42:39.530 --> 01:42:39.540 align:start position:0%
scope of what that would entail but we
 
01:42:41.030 --> 01:42:41.040 align:start position:0%
expect it would be very limited given
 
01:42:44.030 --> 01:42:44.040 align:start position:0%
the fact that my question is why why
 
01:42:45.709 --> 01:42:45.719 align:start position:0%
wouldn't you be willing to assume those
 
01:42:47.930 --> 01:42:47.940 align:start position:0%
costs yourself so and not have it be
 
01:42:50.270 --> 01:42:50.280 align:start position:0%
passed on to utility customers that's a
 
01:42:50.280 --> 01:42:52.609 align:start position:0%
passed on to utility customers that's a
conversation

01:42:52.609 --> 01:42:52.619 align:start position:0%
conversation
 
01:42:52.619 --> 01:42:54.189 align:start position:0%
conversation
um

01:42:54.189 --> 01:42:54.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:42:57.350 --> 01:42:57.360 align:start position:0%
So currently this is already happening
 
01:42:59.570 --> 01:42:59.580 align:start position:0%
with all of the other net metering
 
01:43:01.910 --> 01:43:01.920 align:start position:0%
Arrangements that the utilities are
 
01:43:04.149 --> 01:43:04.159 align:start position:0%
doing this sort of um
 
01:43:08.030 --> 01:43:08.040 align:start position:0%
manual billing process and so
 
01:43:08.040 --> 01:43:09.590 align:start position:0%
manual billing process and so
um

01:43:09.590 --> 01:43:09.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:43:11.990 --> 01:43:12.000 align:start position:0%
becoming a participant in net metering
 
01:43:14.330 --> 01:43:14.340 align:start position:0%
we are just joining a group of all you
 
01:43:16.330 --> 01:43:16.340 align:start position:0%
know otherwise already eligible
 
01:43:18.290 --> 01:43:18.300 align:start position:0%
facilities that are that are net
 
01:43:20.390 --> 01:43:20.400 align:start position:0%
metering so this is just current
 
01:43:23.090 --> 01:43:23.100 align:start position:0%
protocol already and so uh eversource
 
01:43:25.430 --> 01:43:25.440 align:start position:0%
just wanted this acknowledged in in here
 
01:43:27.410 --> 01:43:27.420 align:start position:0%
but it's it's what they're already doing
 
01:43:29.209 --> 01:43:29.219 align:start position:0%
for all of the other
 
01:43:31.850 --> 01:43:31.860 align:start position:0%
um uh anybody else who's net metering as
 
01:43:35.750 --> 01:43:35.760 align:start position:0%
well so this is status quo basically
 
01:43:37.490 --> 01:43:37.500 align:start position:0%
since you've asked two questions I'm
 
01:43:38.930 --> 01:43:38.940 align:start position:0%
going to move on to representative
 
01:43:38.940 --> 01:43:41.030 align:start position:0%
going to move on to representative
Corman

01:43:41.030 --> 01:43:41.040 align:start position:0%
Corman
 
01:43:42.770 --> 01:43:42.780 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
01:43:45.470 --> 01:43:45.480 align:start position:0%
my question so am I understanding this
 
01:43:47.689 --> 01:43:47.699 align:start position:0%
correctly then that because
 
01:43:49.970 --> 01:43:49.980 align:start position:0%
Brookfield and White Mountain paper
 
01:43:51.770 --> 01:43:51.780 align:start position:0%
could not
 
01:43:53.450 --> 01:43:53.460 align:start position:0%
come to an agreement on how to change
 
01:43:56.510 --> 01:43:56.520 align:start position:0%
the PPA you're asking for a legislative
 
01:43:56.520 --> 01:44:00.310 align:start position:0%
the PPA you're asking for a legislative
solution

01:44:00.310 --> 01:44:00.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:02.510 --> 01:44:02.520 align:start position:0%
so what we're looking for is
 
01:44:04.609 --> 01:44:04.619 align:start position:0%
implementing what we thought was the
 
01:44:07.189 --> 01:44:07.199 align:start position:0%
initial intent of the legislation we've
 
01:44:08.990 --> 01:44:09.000 align:start position:0%
we have an existing agreement with white
 
01:44:11.750 --> 01:44:11.760 align:start position:0%
mountain paper uh that dates back to
 
01:44:16.129 --> 01:44:16.139 align:start position:0%
2021 uh neither side wishes to amend
 
01:44:18.790 --> 01:44:18.800 align:start position:0%
that in any way for a variety of reasons
 
01:44:23.149 --> 01:44:23.159 align:start position:0%
uh including the the pricing which uh
 
01:44:25.189 --> 01:44:25.199 align:start position:0%
was established in a in a different
 
01:44:27.350 --> 01:44:27.360 align:start position:0%
Market I think that is is favorable for
 
01:44:30.709 --> 01:44:30.719 align:start position:0%
for the mill so it's not something that
 
01:44:32.990 --> 01:44:33.000 align:start position:0%
that we feel like we want to engage on
 
01:44:35.810 --> 01:44:35.820 align:start position:0%
and I think they would say the same uh
 
01:44:37.729 --> 01:44:37.739 align:start position:0%
and uh and really it's just a matter of
 
01:44:39.830 --> 01:44:39.840 align:start position:0%
trying to implement the initial
 
01:44:42.950 --> 01:44:42.960 align:start position:0%
legislation that we thought achieved
 
01:44:42.960 --> 01:44:45.229 align:start position:0%
legislation that we thought achieved
this

01:44:45.229 --> 01:44:45.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:47.330 --> 01:44:47.340 align:start position:0%
and just to be clear on that I mean um
 
01:44:49.609 --> 01:44:49.619 align:start position:0%
you know White Mountain paper is in the
 
01:44:51.229 --> 01:44:51.239 align:start position:0%
business in the paper business and so
 
01:44:51.239 --> 01:44:52.490 align:start position:0%
business in the paper business and so
they're

01:44:52.490 --> 01:44:52.500 align:start position:0%
they're
 
01:44:53.930 --> 01:44:53.940 align:start position:0%
um they're not really interested in
 
01:44:55.970 --> 01:44:55.980 align:start position:0%
trying to engage
 
01:44:58.669 --> 01:44:58.679 align:start position:0%
and being a customer generator and kind
 
01:44:59.930 --> 01:44:59.940 align:start position:0%
of taking on as Steve was saying taking
 
01:45:04.070 --> 01:45:04.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:06.530 --> 01:45:06.540 align:start position:0%
representative McGee has a question
 
01:45:08.030 --> 01:45:08.040 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
01:45:10.550 --> 01:45:10.560 align:start position:0%
taking my question so in addition to the
 
01:45:13.609 --> 01:45:13.619 align:start position:0%
narrow focus of the bill you said
 
01:45:15.290 --> 01:45:15.300 align:start position:0%
um that the customer generator language
 
01:45:17.990 --> 01:45:18.000 align:start position:0%
that seems to be contentious here was
 
01:45:19.910 --> 01:45:19.920 align:start position:0%
really mirroring or emulating the
 
01:45:21.950 --> 01:45:21.960 align:start position:0%
language that was in the original sb91 I
 
01:45:23.330 --> 01:45:23.340 align:start position:0%
thought in your testimony you stated
 
01:45:23.340 --> 01:45:24.410 align:start position:0%
thought in your testimony you stated
that

01:45:24.410 --> 01:45:24.420 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:45:29.990 --> 01:45:30.000 align:start position:0%
so it it makes it non it's not unique
 
01:45:32.149 --> 01:45:32.159 align:start position:0%
it's intentional that you
 
01:45:34.010 --> 01:45:34.020 align:start position:0%
from our perspective it's it's certainly
 
01:45:36.770 --> 01:45:36.780 align:start position:0%
not new so again the language that I was
 
01:45:39.470 --> 01:45:39.480 align:start position:0%
looking at that's in the original Law
 
01:45:42.950 --> 01:45:42.960 align:start position:0%
um is on line starting at the end of
 
01:45:44.990 --> 01:45:45.000 align:start position:0%
line five where it says that shares
 
01:45:46.669 --> 01:45:46.679 align:start position:0%
equipment or facilities with other
 
01:45:48.590 --> 01:45:48.600 align:start position:0%
generators we're adding in energy
 
01:45:50.450 --> 01:45:50.460 align:start position:0%
storage facilities again this is just
 
01:45:52.129 --> 01:45:52.139 align:start position:0%
sharing equipment
 
01:45:54.050 --> 01:45:54.060 align:start position:0%
um with these with Gen other generators
 
01:45:56.270 --> 01:45:56.280 align:start position:0%
energy storage facilities or electric
 
01:45:58.850 --> 01:45:58.860 align:start position:0%
utility customers for interconnection to
 
01:46:01.010 --> 01:46:01.020 align:start position:0%
the electric grid shall be eligible to
 
01:46:02.930 --> 01:46:02.940 align:start position:0%
participate in net energy metering as a
 
01:46:04.970 --> 01:46:04.980 align:start position:0%
customer generator and then it goes on
 
01:46:07.729 --> 01:46:07.739 align:start position:0%
so that language is all originally in SB
 
01:46:10.010 --> 01:46:10.020 align:start position:0%
91 and
 
01:46:12.890 --> 01:46:12.900 align:start position:0%
um so The Language online 12 through 14
 
01:46:16.490 --> 01:46:16.500 align:start position:0%
is just further clarification that was
 
01:46:19.550 --> 01:46:19.560 align:start position:0%
sought thank you
 
01:46:22.129 --> 01:46:22.139 align:start position:0%
representative Summers has a question
 
01:46:23.570 --> 01:46:23.580 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
01:46:24.709 --> 01:46:24.719 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
01:46:26.689 --> 01:46:26.699 align:start position:0%
um I was just just this mostly just for
 
01:46:29.090 --> 01:46:29.100 align:start position:0%
clarification just to make sure there's
 
01:46:31.189 --> 01:46:31.199 align:start position:0%
no issue of slippery slope I'm looking
 
01:46:34.609 --> 01:46:34.619 align:start position:0%
at 362 A9 and I'm also looking at this
 
01:46:37.010 --> 01:46:37.020 align:start position:0%
bill and I know it does not mention
 
01:46:39.470 --> 01:46:39.480 align:start position:0%
White Mountain or Brookfield and where
 
01:46:41.870 --> 01:46:41.880 align:start position:0%
in this bill or as far as I can find
 
01:46:45.050 --> 01:46:45.060 align:start position:0%
36289 so what sets the limitations to
 
01:46:47.930 --> 01:46:47.940 align:start position:0%
where it's only affecting these two
 
01:46:50.390 --> 01:46:50.400 align:start position:0%
right so
 
01:46:53.149 --> 01:46:53.159 align:start position:0%
um so this issue of the Legacy wiring
 
01:46:54.290 --> 01:46:54.300 align:start position:0%
that I've been talking about where you
 
01:46:57.109 --> 01:46:57.119 align:start position:0%
have multiple Hydro facilities behind a
 
01:46:59.870 --> 01:46:59.880 align:start position:0%
single interconnection point to the grid
 
01:47:01.729 --> 01:47:01.739 align:start position:0%
and that interconnection point in both
 
01:47:04.970 --> 01:47:04.980 align:start position:0%
cases is the as a paper mill we've been
 
01:47:06.770 --> 01:47:06.780 align:start position:0%
you know talking about this issue for
 
01:47:09.050 --> 01:47:09.060 align:start position:0%
for a number of years
 
01:47:10.669 --> 01:47:10.679 align:start position:0%
um and I represent the granite state
 
01:47:12.830 --> 01:47:12.840 align:start position:0%
hydropower Association as well which is
 
01:47:14.750 --> 01:47:14.760 align:start position:0%
the association of small-scale hydro
 
01:47:17.030 --> 01:47:17.040 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire and
 
01:47:17.040 --> 01:47:18.350 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire and
um

01:47:18.350 --> 01:47:18.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:47:19.910 --> 01:47:19.920 align:start position:0%
you know it's not to say that there's
 
01:47:22.129 --> 01:47:22.139 align:start position:0%
not somebody out there hiding under a
 
01:47:24.290 --> 01:47:24.300 align:start position:0%
rock that hasn't been paying attention
 
01:47:26.750 --> 01:47:26.760 align:start position:0%
but um I I'm not aware of any other
 
01:47:29.750 --> 01:47:29.760 align:start position:0%
situations which have this Legacy wiring
 
01:47:32.090 --> 01:47:32.100 align:start position:0%
problem it does seem to be uh you know
 
01:47:33.950 --> 01:47:33.960 align:start position:0%
it when you think about the history of
 
01:47:36.590 --> 01:47:36.600 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire with all of our Mills and
 
01:47:39.770 --> 01:47:39.780 align:start position:0%
those being powered by Hydro facilities
 
01:47:42.050 --> 01:47:42.060 align:start position:0%
um you know a lot of them have been
 
01:47:45.530 --> 01:47:45.540 align:start position:0%
upgraded over the years but in in
 
01:47:47.570 --> 01:47:47.580 align:start position:0%
um and ownership maybe has
 
01:47:47.580 --> 01:47:48.229 align:start position:0%
um and ownership maybe has
um

01:47:48.229 --> 01:47:48.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:47:50.209 --> 01:47:50.219 align:start position:0%
between Mills and the Hydra facilities
 
01:47:53.090 --> 01:47:53.100 align:start position:0%
have stayed together on under one
 
01:47:54.410 --> 01:47:54.420 align:start position:0%
umbrella but
 
01:47:54.420 --> 01:47:55.010 align:start position:0%
umbrella but
um

01:47:55.010 --> 01:47:55.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:47:56.810 --> 01:47:56.820 align:start position:0%
this is just a legacy wiring problem
 
01:47:58.129 --> 01:47:58.139 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
01:48:01.070 --> 01:48:01.080 align:start position:0%
that we have here and I just add that
 
01:48:01.080 --> 01:48:01.910 align:start position:0%
that we have here and I just add that
the

01:48:01.910 --> 01:48:01.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:48:04.189 --> 01:48:04.199 align:start position:0%
the language also of course includes a
 
01:48:07.850 --> 01:48:07.860 align:start position:0%
commercial operation date that is 2021
 
01:48:10.669 --> 01:48:10.679 align:start position:0%
or before and then obviously the the
 
01:48:13.070 --> 01:48:13.080 align:start position:0%
program sizing requirements as well okay
 
01:48:16.070 --> 01:48:16.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:17.930 --> 01:48:17.940 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington has a question
 
01:48:19.550 --> 01:48:19.560 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
01:48:21.169 --> 01:48:21.179 align:start position:0%
my question you keep mentioning this
 
01:48:23.629 --> 01:48:23.639 align:start position:0%
Legacy wiring issue is there anything
 
01:48:26.510 --> 01:48:26.520 align:start position:0%
that's stopping uh that from being fixed
 
01:48:28.189 --> 01:48:28.199 align:start position:0%
and being brought up to what you would
 
01:48:30.830 --> 01:48:30.840 align:start position:0%
say I guess today's way of doing it and
 
01:48:32.750 --> 01:48:32.760 align:start position:0%
you keep mentioning Antiques and so
 
01:48:35.209 --> 01:48:35.219 align:start position:0%
forth so uh what's preventing you from
 
01:48:37.370 --> 01:48:37.380 align:start position:0%
just making the fix yourself so so the
 
01:48:40.070 --> 01:48:40.080 align:start position:0%
sites obviously are up to date as as
 
01:48:42.770 --> 01:48:42.780 align:start position:0%
needed for safe operations there's new
 
01:48:44.870 --> 01:48:44.880 align:start position:0%
metering at each of the the stations and
 
01:48:44.880 --> 01:48:45.770 align:start position:0%
metering at each of the the stations and
whatnot

01:48:45.770 --> 01:48:45.780 align:start position:0%
whatnot
 
01:48:48.470 --> 01:48:48.480 align:start position:0%
um the reality is uh the two of the
 
01:48:49.910 --> 01:48:49.920 align:start position:0%
facilities actually interconnect through
 
01:48:51.950 --> 01:48:51.960 align:start position:0%
the mill and then each of them all
 
01:48:53.770 --> 01:48:53.780 align:start position:0%
interconnect to the same
 
01:48:58.490 --> 01:48:58.500 align:start position:0%
substation for us to do this separately
 
01:49:01.970 --> 01:49:01.980 align:start position:0%
would be economically not feasible and
 
01:49:05.209 --> 01:49:05.219 align:start position:0%
and provide sort of no uh you know
 
01:49:07.930 --> 01:49:07.940 align:start position:0%
operational difference
 
01:49:11.090 --> 01:49:11.100 align:start position:0%
follow-up so what you're saying is that
 
01:49:13.669 --> 01:49:13.679 align:start position:0%
you could do it but it's too expensive
 
01:49:16.070 --> 01:49:16.080 align:start position:0%
and you you could qualify under the
 
01:49:17.990 --> 01:49:18.000 align:start position:0%
existing net metering laws if you made
 
01:49:20.090 --> 01:49:20.100 align:start position:0%
that change is that correct that is by
 
01:49:21.649 --> 01:49:21.659 align:start position:0%
understanding I mean we've never looked
 
01:49:24.169 --> 01:49:24.179 align:start position:0%
at in detail at a high level we've seen
 
01:49:25.850 --> 01:49:25.860 align:start position:0%
the numbers and said yes that it's not
 
01:49:29.290 --> 01:49:29.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:31.669 --> 01:49:31.679 align:start position:0%
representative Summers remember to turn
 
01:49:32.930 --> 01:49:32.940 align:start position:0%
off your microphone when you're not
 
01:49:32.940 --> 01:49:34.430 align:start position:0%
off your microphone when you're not
speaking

01:49:34.430 --> 01:49:34.440 align:start position:0%
speaking
 
01:49:35.930 --> 01:49:35.940 align:start position:0%
all right further questions from the
 
01:49:35.940 --> 01:49:37.790 align:start position:0%
all right further questions from the
committee

01:49:37.790 --> 01:49:37.800 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:49:39.890 --> 01:49:39.900 align:start position:0%
seeing none I'd like to call next on
 
01:49:42.530 --> 01:49:42.540 align:start position:0%
Michael Licata representing eversource
 
01:49:44.870 --> 01:49:44.880 align:start position:0%
to give us his perspective on this
 
01:49:44.880 --> 01:49:58.370 align:start position:0%
to give us his perspective on this
legislation

01:49:58.370 --> 01:49:58.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:00.590 --> 01:50:00.600 align:start position:0%
good morning uh Michael Licata
 
01:50:03.470 --> 01:50:03.480 align:start position:0%
representing eversource uh here in
 
01:50:06.830 --> 01:50:06.840 align:start position:0%
support of the bill I'll be brief in my
 
01:50:08.390 --> 01:50:08.400 align:start position:0%
comments because I do not want to be
 
01:50:11.570 --> 01:50:11.580 align:start position:0%
repetitive I think Mr Roberts and Miss
 
01:50:14.290 --> 01:50:14.300 align:start position:0%
Crowell did an excellent job outlining
 
01:50:17.450 --> 01:50:17.460 align:start position:0%
the background and what the bill is
 
01:50:20.050 --> 01:50:20.060 align:start position:0%
trying to to solve for
 
01:50:23.890 --> 01:50:23.900 align:start position:0%
really ever source's interests here are
 
01:50:27.050 --> 01:50:27.060 align:start position:0%
focused on getting accurate metering
 
01:50:29.810 --> 01:50:29.820 align:start position:0%
data out of the generation facilities
 
01:50:32.390 --> 01:50:32.400 align:start position:0%
which exists behind the retail meters as
 
01:50:34.729 --> 01:50:34.739 align:start position:0%
you've heard from both Mr Roberts and
 
01:50:36.290 --> 01:50:36.300 align:start position:0%
Miss Crowell
 
01:50:36.300 --> 01:50:37.490 align:start position:0%
Miss Crowell
uh

01:50:37.490 --> 01:50:37.500 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:50:40.609 --> 01:50:40.619 align:start position:0%
there is uh
 
01:50:44.030 --> 01:50:44.040 align:start position:0%
net metering qualified generation and
 
01:50:45.950 --> 01:50:45.960 align:start position:0%
generation that does not qualify for net
 
01:50:48.169 --> 01:50:48.179 align:start position:0%
metering all behind the retail meter and
 
01:50:51.470 --> 01:50:51.480 align:start position:0%
so eversource we don't have insight into
 
01:50:53.390 --> 01:50:53.400 align:start position:0%
the electricity that's being put back
 
01:50:55.430 --> 01:50:55.440 align:start position:0%
onto our distribution system the the
 
01:50:58.250 --> 01:50:58.260 align:start position:0%
source of that and so what the bill
 
01:51:02.649 --> 01:51:02.659 align:start position:0%
tries to do or solve for is allow for
 
01:51:06.709 --> 01:51:06.719 align:start position:0%
the customer or the generator to read
 
01:51:10.250 --> 01:51:10.260 align:start position:0%
the existing Revenue grade meters which
 
01:51:12.530 --> 01:51:12.540 align:start position:0%
are very accurate meters that are used
 
01:51:14.510 --> 01:51:14.520 align:start position:0%
to enable these facilities to
 
01:51:16.910 --> 01:51:16.920 align:start position:0%
participate in the regional markets read
 
01:51:19.070 --> 01:51:19.080 align:start position:0%
those meters and then provide that data
 
01:51:22.010 --> 01:51:22.020 align:start position:0%
to eversource on a monthly basis so then
 
01:51:23.990 --> 01:51:24.000 align:start position:0%
we can build them appropriately and
 
01:51:27.649 --> 01:51:27.659 align:start position:0%
apply net metering credits appropriately
 
01:51:30.410 --> 01:51:30.420 align:start position:0%
and that's all subject to a methodology
 
01:51:33.050 --> 01:51:33.060 align:start position:0%
that gets filed with the utility in the
 
01:51:35.750 --> 01:51:35.760 align:start position:0%
department of energy and gets approval
 
01:51:38.810 --> 01:51:38.820 align:start position:0%
and just to ensure the accuracy of that
 
01:51:42.229 --> 01:51:42.239 align:start position:0%
data the bill further lays out the
 
01:51:45.229 --> 01:51:45.239 align:start position:0%
ability to audit that data on an annual
 
01:51:47.390 --> 01:51:47.400 align:start position:0%
basis as requested by the department of
 
01:51:48.669 --> 01:51:48.679 align:start position:0%
energy so
 
01:51:51.350 --> 01:51:51.360 align:start position:0%
that is our our interest is really
 
01:51:55.250 --> 01:51:55.260 align:start position:0%
trying to get as Miss Kroll
 
01:51:57.910 --> 01:51:57.920 align:start position:0%
talked about this sort of unique
 
01:52:01.490 --> 01:52:01.500 align:start position:0%
metering or wiring arrangement to get
 
01:52:04.609 --> 01:52:04.619 align:start position:0%
accurate data on what generator is
 
01:52:07.390 --> 01:52:07.400 align:start position:0%
producing the electricity that gets
 
01:52:10.550 --> 01:52:10.560 align:start position:0%
put back onto our distribution system
 
01:52:13.189 --> 01:52:13.199 align:start position:0%
and then again accurately providing them
 
01:52:16.970 --> 01:52:16.980 align:start position:0%
with the appropriate compensation as
 
01:52:20.510 --> 01:52:20.520 align:start position:0%
laid out in SB 91 which was passed in
 
01:52:23.149 --> 01:52:23.159 align:start position:0%
2021 and with that I'd be happy to
 
01:52:24.709 --> 01:52:24.719 align:start position:0%
answer any questions the committee may
 
01:52:24.719 --> 01:52:25.850 align:start position:0%
answer any questions the committee may
have

01:52:25.850 --> 01:52:25.860 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:52:27.890 --> 01:52:27.900 align:start position:0%
thank you appreciate your being here
 
01:52:30.950 --> 01:52:30.960 align:start position:0%
today testifying before the committee I
 
01:52:33.229 --> 01:52:33.239 align:start position:0%
have a quick question for you it's a
 
01:52:35.030 --> 01:52:35.040 align:start position:0%
sort of a repetition of a question I
 
01:52:38.330 --> 01:52:38.340 align:start position:0%
asked earlier from the utility point of
 
01:52:40.189 --> 01:52:40.199 align:start position:0%
view what would happen to the
 
01:52:42.169 --> 01:52:42.179 align:start position:0%
interconnection point if White Mountain
 
01:52:45.050 --> 01:52:45.060 align:start position:0%
paper was to shut down
 
01:52:48.590 --> 01:52:48.600 align:start position:0%
uh so white it's a good question I think
 
01:52:52.189 --> 01:52:52.199 align:start position:0%
I need to touch base with folks uh back
 
01:52:54.770 --> 01:52:54.780 align:start position:0%
at the office White Mountain paper is
 
01:52:56.750 --> 01:52:56.760 align:start position:0%
the customer of record they have the
 
01:52:58.310 --> 01:52:58.320 align:start position:0%
retail meter
 
01:53:01.910 --> 01:53:01.920 align:start position:0%
um assuming no one takes over the plant
 
01:53:04.850 --> 01:53:04.860 align:start position:0%
and it just sits dormant
 
01:53:07.550 --> 01:53:07.560 align:start position:0%
um I I would have to double check it's
 
01:53:09.530 --> 01:53:09.540 align:start position:0%
possible that
 
01:53:12.590 --> 01:53:12.600 align:start position:0%
um at that point Brookfield could take
 
01:53:14.149 --> 01:53:14.159 align:start position:0%
over that retail meter although you
 
01:53:16.729 --> 01:53:16.739 align:start position:0%
would still have that same uh issue
 
01:53:17.689 --> 01:53:17.699 align:start position:0%
where you have the single
 
01:53:20.270 --> 01:53:20.280 align:start position:0%
interconnection point and then multiple
 
01:53:23.870 --> 01:53:23.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:26.270 --> 01:53:26.280 align:start position:0%
okay thank you additional questions now
 
01:53:27.530 --> 01:53:27.540 align:start position:0%
from the committee representative
 
01:53:29.629 --> 01:53:29.639 align:start position:0%
Harrington has one thank you thank you
 
01:53:31.129 --> 01:53:31.139 align:start position:0%
for taking my question you mentioned a
 
01:53:32.870 --> 01:53:32.880 align:start position:0%
couple of times your this would give you
 
01:53:34.850 --> 01:53:34.860 align:start position:0%
more accurate data so I'm a little
 
01:53:36.890 --> 01:53:36.900 align:start position:0%
confused what are you doing now just
 
01:53:39.229 --> 01:53:39.239 align:start position:0%
guessing I mean it must be something
 
01:53:41.149 --> 01:53:41.159 align:start position:0%
you're using to measure this amount now
 
01:53:43.370 --> 01:53:43.380 align:start position:0%
we're not providing them with net
 
01:53:47.390 --> 01:53:47.400 align:start position:0%
metering credits today so uh essentially
 
01:53:49.550 --> 01:53:49.560 align:start position:0%
what ever gets used on site Whatever
 
01:53:51.470 --> 01:53:51.480 align:start position:0%
Gets produced they're not getting that
 
01:53:54.169 --> 01:53:54.179 align:start position:0%
metering credits today so we don't have
 
01:53:57.770 --> 01:53:57.780 align:start position:0%
to track essentially What entity is
 
01:53:59.990 --> 01:54:00.000 align:start position:0%
producing that electricity behind the
 
01:54:01.850 --> 01:54:01.860 align:start position:0%
meter okay follow-up
 
01:54:04.970 --> 01:54:04.980 align:start position:0%
follow up so the need for accurate data
 
01:54:07.370 --> 01:54:07.380 align:start position:0%
only exists if this bill were to pass
 
01:54:08.750 --> 01:54:08.760 align:start position:0%
and they would be eligible for net
 
01:54:10.850 --> 01:54:10.860 align:start position:0%
metering as it is right now it's not an
 
01:54:13.370 --> 01:54:13.380 align:start position:0%
issue is that correct so the the issue
 
01:54:15.830 --> 01:54:15.840 align:start position:0%
stems from the passage of Senate Bill 91
 
01:54:18.530 --> 01:54:18.540 align:start position:0%
back in 2021 which made these facilities
 
01:54:21.470 --> 01:54:21.480 align:start position:0%
eligible for net metering however as Ms
 
01:54:23.330 --> 01:54:23.340 align:start position:0%
Kroll said we haven't been able to
 
01:54:25.910 --> 01:54:25.920 align:start position:0%
implement that public policy decision
 
01:54:28.370 --> 01:54:28.380 align:start position:0%
because we don't have the accurate
 
01:54:31.430 --> 01:54:31.440 align:start position:0%
meeting metering data
 
01:54:34.490 --> 01:54:34.500 align:start position:0%
representative Bernardi has a question
 
01:54:37.729 --> 01:54:37.739 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair so is it possible to
 
01:54:41.090 --> 01:54:41.100 align:start position:0%
put a meter on the output of each of the
 
01:54:44.689 --> 01:54:44.699 align:start position:0%
individual Hydro facilities
 
01:54:47.629 --> 01:54:47.639 align:start position:0%
so that is possible but as uh was
 
01:54:51.350 --> 01:54:51.360 align:start position:0%
testified by others uh that would
 
01:54:55.430 --> 01:54:55.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:58.970 --> 01:54:58.980 align:start position:0%
have economic implications that uh would
 
01:55:01.070 --> 01:55:01.080 align:start position:0%
be essentially expensive for them to
 
01:55:02.149 --> 01:55:02.159 align:start position:0%
comply with
 
01:55:04.550 --> 01:55:04.560 align:start position:0%
the cost of the meter itself would be
 
01:55:06.169 --> 01:55:06.179 align:start position:0%
that I mean I understand the
 
01:55:09.350 --> 01:55:09.360 align:start position:0%
interconnection issue but so they they
 
01:55:12.890 --> 01:55:12.900 align:start position:0%
have meters on them now uh that the
 
01:55:15.530 --> 01:55:15.540 align:start position:0%
customer owns or the generator owns I
 
01:55:18.109 --> 01:55:18.119 align:start position:0%
should say uh the revenue grade meters
 
01:55:20.689 --> 01:55:20.699 align:start position:0%
that are being used uh when the
 
01:55:22.250 --> 01:55:22.260 align:start position:0%
facilities I understand it participate
 
01:55:24.050 --> 01:55:24.060 align:start position:0%
in Regional markets so metering does
 
01:55:27.050 --> 01:55:27.060 align:start position:0%
exist they're not ever sources meters in
 
01:55:29.510 --> 01:55:29.520 align:start position:0%
order for us to to wire and and have our
 
01:55:32.209 --> 01:55:32.219 align:start position:0%
own meters at each individual location
 
01:55:35.629 --> 01:55:35.639 align:start position:0%
uh would be would be expensive for the
 
01:55:37.010 --> 01:55:37.020 align:start position:0%
the customer
 
01:55:38.330 --> 01:55:38.340 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
01:55:41.450 --> 01:55:41.460 align:start position:0%
so is it possible for you to you agree
 
01:55:44.090 --> 01:55:44.100 align:start position:0%
that the meters are good quality meters
 
01:55:46.790 --> 01:55:46.800 align:start position:0%
is it possible for you to use
 
01:55:49.310 --> 01:55:49.320 align:start position:0%
readings from those meters even though
 
01:55:51.950 --> 01:55:51.960 align:start position:0%
you don't own them correct and that is
 
01:55:53.169 --> 01:55:53.179 align:start position:0%
what the bill
 
01:55:56.930 --> 01:55:56.940 align:start position:0%
authorizes it authorizes the customer or
 
01:55:59.629 --> 01:55:59.639 align:start position:0%
the generator to read their revenue
 
01:56:02.689 --> 01:56:02.699 align:start position:0%
grade meters and then provide that data
 
01:56:05.450 --> 01:56:05.460 align:start position:0%
data to eversource on a monthly basis
 
01:56:07.910 --> 01:56:07.920 align:start position:0%
under a methodology approved by the
 
01:56:09.950 --> 01:56:09.960 align:start position:0%
department of energy so that we can
 
01:56:13.250 --> 01:56:13.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:13.260 --> 01:56:14.629 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:56:14.629 --> 01:56:14.639 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:56:16.550 --> 01:56:16.560 align:start position:0%
follow up again
 
01:56:18.830 --> 01:56:18.840 align:start position:0%
one clarification needed
 
01:56:18.840 --> 01:56:20.570 align:start position:0%
one clarification needed
so

01:56:20.570 --> 01:56:20.580 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:56:20.580 --> 01:56:22.370 align:start position:0%
so
then

01:56:22.370 --> 01:56:22.380 align:start position:0%
then
 
01:56:26.629 --> 01:56:26.639 align:start position:0%
the the hydro facility would be the
 
01:56:28.490 --> 01:56:28.500 align:start position:0%
customer generator we're not talking
 
01:56:28.500 --> 01:56:29.750 align:start position:0%
customer generator we're not talking
about

01:56:29.750 --> 01:56:29.760 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:56:32.330 --> 01:56:32.340 align:start position:0%
White Mountain paper being the the the
 
01:56:38.149 --> 01:56:38.159 align:start position:0%
uh the customer it's white it's it's the
 
01:56:40.070 --> 01:56:40.080 align:start position:0%
actual Hydro facility
 
01:56:43.729 --> 01:56:43.739 align:start position:0%
so under the bill correct the facility
 
01:56:46.310 --> 01:56:46.320 align:start position:0%
would be the customer generator and in
 
01:56:49.010 --> 01:56:49.020 align:start position:0%
the case of uh
 
01:56:53.510 --> 01:56:53.520 align:start position:0%
Brookfield and uh White Mountain paper
 
01:56:56.870 --> 01:56:56.880 align:start position:0%
one is the customer of record that own
 
01:56:59.290 --> 01:56:59.300 align:start position:0%
that we we build with a retail meter
 
01:57:02.870 --> 01:57:02.880 align:start position:0%
behind that retail meter are the
 
01:57:04.550 --> 01:57:04.560 align:start position:0%
generation generators owned by
 
01:57:04.560 --> 01:57:05.990 align:start position:0%
generation generators owned by
Brookfield

01:57:05.990 --> 01:57:06.000 align:start position:0%
Brookfield
 
01:57:07.790 --> 01:57:07.800 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:57:09.770 --> 01:57:09.780 align:start position:0%
okay representative Thomas has a
 
01:57:11.750 --> 01:57:11.760 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair thank you
 
01:57:13.669 --> 01:57:13.679 align:start position:0%
for taking my question for clarification
 
01:57:16.250 --> 01:57:16.260 align:start position:0%
you said something earlier that kind of
 
01:57:18.589 --> 01:57:18.599 align:start position:0%
confused me you said that under the
 
01:57:22.729 --> 01:57:22.739 align:start position:0%
previous bills that's Bill 91 that both
 
01:57:25.250 --> 01:57:25.260 align:start position:0%
entities already qualified for net
 
01:57:27.410 --> 01:57:27.420 align:start position:0%
medium for net metering
 
01:57:32.750 --> 01:57:32.760 align:start position:0%
correct so if if that is true then what
 
01:57:35.030 --> 01:57:35.040 align:start position:0%
would be the need for lines 12 through
 
01:57:35.040 --> 01:57:36.530 align:start position:0%
would be the need for lines 12 through
15

01:57:36.530 --> 01:57:36.540 align:start position:0%
15
 
01:57:39.830 --> 01:57:39.840 align:start position:0%
that seems to be in dispute right now
 
01:57:43.669 --> 01:57:43.679 align:start position:0%
so to to answer the first part
 
01:57:45.890 --> 01:57:45.900 align:start position:0%
um the as I understand it the intention
 
01:57:50.149 --> 01:57:50.159 align:start position:0%
of Senate Bill 91 was to allow
 
01:57:52.490 --> 01:57:52.500 align:start position:0%
these hydroelectric facilities to
 
01:57:55.790 --> 01:57:55.800 align:start position:0%
qualify for net metering in excess of
 
01:57:57.470 --> 01:57:57.480 align:start position:0%
one megawatt
 
01:58:01.189 --> 01:58:01.199 align:start position:0%
and the challenge was that again as I
 
01:58:03.830 --> 01:58:03.840 align:start position:0%
and others described we we don't have a
 
01:58:06.109 --> 01:58:06.119 align:start position:0%
way to accurately meter
 
01:58:09.530 --> 01:58:09.540 align:start position:0%
without a change in legislation
 
01:58:11.629 --> 01:58:11.639 align:start position:0%
um the the output of those facilities
 
01:58:13.550 --> 01:58:13.560 align:start position:0%
the the second part of your question
 
01:58:16.550 --> 01:58:16.560 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas about uh lines 12
 
01:58:18.649 --> 01:58:18.659 align:start position:0%
through 15.
 
01:58:18.659 --> 01:58:20.390 align:start position:0%
through 15.
um

01:58:20.390 --> 01:58:20.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:58:25.510 --> 01:58:25.520 align:start position:0%
I I believe that that language uh
 
01:58:31.490 --> 01:58:31.500 align:start position:0%
is intended to make it clear that uh the
 
01:58:33.770 --> 01:58:33.780 align:start position:0%
use of the term customer generator which
 
01:58:36.770 --> 01:58:36.780 align:start position:0%
exists in statute applies to these
 
01:58:38.930 --> 01:58:38.940 align:start position:0%
facilities so uh makes additional
 
01:58:43.850 --> 01:58:43.860 align:start position:0%
clarification above uh the language that
 
01:58:47.030 --> 01:58:47.040 align:start position:0%
you see lines three through twelve which
 
01:58:48.709 --> 01:58:48.719 align:start position:0%
aside from the additions of energy
 
01:58:50.410 --> 01:58:50.420 align:start position:0%
storage facilities
 
01:58:55.790 --> 01:58:55.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:58.189 --> 01:58:58.199 align:start position:0%
seems to make it more unclear but
 
01:59:01.430 --> 01:59:01.440 align:start position:0%
thank you okay additional questions from
 
01:59:03.350 --> 01:59:03.360 align:start position:0%
the committee representative munz has a
 
01:59:05.689 --> 01:59:05.699 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair thank you
 
01:59:07.850 --> 01:59:07.860 align:start position:0%
for being here again
 
01:59:10.550 --> 01:59:10.560 align:start position:0%
um the the bill talks about incremental
 
01:59:12.350 --> 01:59:12.360 align:start position:0%
costs relative to a manual billing
 
01:59:13.729 --> 01:59:13.739 align:start position:0%
process and I think you alluded to that
 
01:59:16.070 --> 01:59:16.080 align:start position:0%
as well in your in your testimony
 
01:59:18.890 --> 01:59:18.900 align:start position:0%
those costs that you would be incurring
 
01:59:20.870 --> 01:59:20.880 align:start position:0%
is that are those above and beyond what
 
01:59:23.510 --> 01:59:23.520 align:start position:0%
you normally would incur for a net
 
01:59:25.790 --> 01:59:25.800 align:start position:0%
metering in it for a net metering
 
01:59:28.729 --> 01:59:28.739 align:start position:0%
situation yeah so uh it's it's
 
01:59:31.910 --> 01:59:31.920 align:start position:0%
consistent with the costs that the
 
01:59:35.510 --> 01:59:35.520 align:start position:0%
utilities incur for for similar
 
01:59:38.030 --> 01:59:38.040 align:start position:0%
arrangements so essentially all group
 
01:59:41.510 --> 01:59:41.520 align:start position:0%
net metering is a manual process so it's
 
01:59:43.790 --> 01:59:43.800 align:start position:0%
it's spreadsheets it's folks taking
 
01:59:46.669 --> 01:59:46.679 align:start position:0%
information from one system and entering
 
01:59:48.470 --> 01:59:48.480 align:start position:0%
it into another and doing the manual
 
01:59:50.390 --> 01:59:50.400 align:start position:0%
billing process and this would be be
 
01:59:51.770 --> 01:59:51.780 align:start position:0%
quite consistent so we'll be getting a
 
01:59:53.570 --> 01:59:53.580 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet from
 
01:59:56.270 --> 01:59:56.280 align:start position:0%
um from the generator under the
 
01:59:58.490 --> 01:59:58.500 align:start position:0%
methodology approved by the department
 
02:00:01.370 --> 02:00:01.380 align:start position:0%
of energy and employees will be entering
 
02:00:04.430 --> 02:00:04.440 align:start position:0%
that data and manually building so it is
 
02:00:08.629 --> 02:00:08.639 align:start position:0%
consistent with and as Ms Kroll said is
 
02:00:10.310 --> 02:00:10.320 align:start position:0%
consistent with the cost recovery of
 
02:00:10.320 --> 02:00:11.270 align:start position:0%
consistent with the cost recovery of
those

02:00:11.270 --> 02:00:11.280 align:start position:0%
those
 
02:00:13.310 --> 02:00:13.320 align:start position:0%
um of that existing process
 
02:00:13.320 --> 02:00:14.689 align:start position:0%
um of that existing process
follow-up

02:00:14.689 --> 02:00:14.699 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
02:00:18.410 --> 02:00:18.420 align:start position:0%
follow-up so so is it fair to say then
 
02:00:21.649 --> 02:00:21.659 align:start position:0%
that there would be no additional cost
 
02:00:24.050 --> 02:00:24.060 align:start position:0%
to utility customers
 
02:00:26.810 --> 02:00:26.820 align:start position:0%
because of this special arrangement
 
02:00:30.290 --> 02:00:30.300 align:start position:0%
and then they might otherwise incur so
 
02:00:33.410 --> 02:00:33.420 align:start position:0%
the additional there there would be
 
02:00:36.109 --> 02:00:36.119 align:start position:0%
I I would say
 
02:00:38.390 --> 02:00:38.400 align:start position:0%
it is consistent with
 
02:00:41.149 --> 02:00:41.159 align:start position:0%
the additional costs already incurred
 
02:00:42.649 --> 02:00:42.659 align:start position:0%
essentially what we're talking about is
 
02:00:44.930 --> 02:00:44.940 align:start position:0%
an employee taking a spreadsheet and
 
02:00:47.870 --> 02:00:47.880 align:start position:0%
doing data entry on a monthly basis it
 
02:00:49.010 --> 02:00:49.020 align:start position:0%
is not
 
02:00:51.890 --> 02:00:51.900 align:start position:0%
significant dollars and it is consistent
 
02:00:54.770 --> 02:00:54.780 align:start position:0%
with other forms of net metering how we
 
02:00:57.109 --> 02:00:57.119 align:start position:0%
process that at billing I mean it's it
 
02:00:58.970 --> 02:00:58.980 align:start position:0%
would be
 
02:01:01.669 --> 02:01:01.679 align:start position:0%
not significant uh in terms of money I
 
02:01:03.890 --> 02:01:03.900 align:start position:0%
would say in the thousands not tens of
 
02:01:06.709 --> 02:01:06.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:08.570 --> 02:01:08.580 align:start position:0%
representative McGee has a question
 
02:01:10.609 --> 02:01:10.619 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you Mr
 
02:01:12.370 --> 02:01:12.380 align:start position:0%
Licata for taking my question
 
02:01:14.810 --> 02:01:14.820 align:start position:0%
my question is around whether there's
 
02:01:17.530 --> 02:01:17.540 align:start position:0%
any value to be gained of having Hydro
 
02:01:20.570 --> 02:01:20.580 align:start position:0%
energy going on back on the grid because
 
02:01:22.550 --> 02:01:22.560 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that right now that
 
02:01:25.790 --> 02:01:25.800 align:start position:0%
Hydro is probably pricing lower
 
02:01:27.589 --> 02:01:27.599 align:start position:0%
than some other forms of energy that we
 
02:01:29.030 --> 02:01:29.040 align:start position:0%
have going through the system to produce
 
02:01:30.950 --> 02:01:30.960 align:start position:0%
electricity so can you speak to that do
 
02:01:32.270 --> 02:01:32.280 align:start position:0%
you know what the
 
02:01:35.870 --> 02:01:35.880 align:start position:0%
what what the cost of of hydro is going
 
02:01:35.880 --> 02:01:36.770 align:start position:0%
what what the cost of of hydro is going
for

02:01:36.770 --> 02:01:36.780 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:01:38.510 --> 02:01:38.520 align:start position:0%
yeah I
 
02:01:40.310 --> 02:01:40.320 align:start position:0%
I really can't speak to it and it's
 
02:01:42.050 --> 02:01:42.060 align:start position:0%
great to see you back on the committee
 
02:01:42.060 --> 02:01:43.729 align:start position:0%
great to see you back on the committee
representative

02:01:43.729 --> 02:01:43.739 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:01:45.709 --> 02:01:45.719 align:start position:0%
um so I just
 
02:01:48.589 --> 02:01:48.599 align:start position:0%
certainly I think
 
02:01:51.649 --> 02:01:51.659 align:start position:0%
um RPS qualified small-scale Hydro in
 
02:01:54.350 --> 02:01:54.360 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is a fantastic resource
 
02:01:56.229 --> 02:01:56.239 align:start position:0%
which is why the
 
02:02:00.169 --> 02:02:00.179 align:start position:0%
legislature had you know specifically uh
 
02:02:02.390 --> 02:02:02.400 align:start position:0%
called it out as part of the state RPS
 
02:02:05.629 --> 02:02:05.639 align:start position:0%
and it has its own class and own uh
 
02:02:07.550 --> 02:02:07.560 align:start position:0%
alternative compliance payment structure
 
02:02:11.330 --> 02:02:11.340 align:start position:0%
so uh it is a a very good resource as
 
02:02:13.669 --> 02:02:13.679 align:start position:0%
folks said it uh Mr Griffin I think
 
02:02:16.550 --> 02:02:16.560 align:start position:0%
Robert said it has a higher capacity
 
02:02:18.229 --> 02:02:18.239 align:start position:0%
Factor than other forms of renewable
 
02:02:20.270 --> 02:02:20.280 align:start position:0%
generation and certainly provides a
 
02:02:23.089 --> 02:02:23.099 align:start position:0%
benefit in terms of the specific pricing
 
02:02:27.350 --> 02:02:27.360 align:start position:0%
that these facilities uh are sort of
 
02:02:29.629 --> 02:02:29.639 align:start position:0%
providing for their energy it really
 
02:02:31.370 --> 02:02:31.380 align:start position:0%
I think some have purchased power
 
02:02:33.770 --> 02:02:33.780 align:start position:0%
arrangements with either municipality or
 
02:02:36.530 --> 02:02:36.540 align:start position:0%
commercial generator others if they're
 
02:02:39.589 --> 02:02:39.599 align:start position:0%
small enough can net meter
 
02:02:42.290 --> 02:02:42.300 align:start position:0%
um others still might bid into the
 
02:02:43.850 --> 02:02:43.860 align:start position:0%
regional market
 
02:02:46.790 --> 02:02:46.800 align:start position:0%
um so it's it's kind of a grab bag here
 
02:02:49.490 --> 02:02:49.500 align:start position:0%
we're talking about these um
 
02:02:52.669 --> 02:02:52.679 align:start position:0%
specific locations getting getting the
 
02:02:52.679 --> 02:02:53.709 align:start position:0%
specific locations getting getting the
uh

02:02:53.709 --> 02:02:53.719 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:02:57.890 --> 02:02:57.900 align:start position:0%
net metering compensation between one
 
02:03:01.310 --> 02:03:01.320 align:start position:0%
megawatt and five megawatts and okay
 
02:03:04.609 --> 02:03:04.619 align:start position:0%
cool thank you very much thanks before I
 
02:03:07.490 --> 02:03:07.500 align:start position:0%
uh call on the last person who wants to
 
02:03:10.010 --> 02:03:10.020 align:start position:0%
speak to us about this bill I want to
 
02:03:11.689 --> 02:03:11.699 align:start position:0%
address what
 
02:03:13.910 --> 02:03:13.920 align:start position:0%
everyone must have noticed by now and
 
02:03:16.070 --> 02:03:16.080 align:start position:0%
that is that we are running way behind
 
02:03:17.629 --> 02:03:17.639 align:start position:0%
schedule so
 
02:03:20.209 --> 02:03:20.219 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 68 which was scheduled for
 
02:03:23.510 --> 02:03:23.520 align:start position:0%
10 a.m is obviously now about an hour
 
02:03:25.970 --> 02:03:25.980 align:start position:0%
eight minutes behind
 
02:03:29.149 --> 02:03:29.159 align:start position:0%
69 which was scheduled for 10 30 is
 
02:03:31.850 --> 02:03:31.860 align:start position:0%
behind that as is 79 so it doesn't look
 
02:03:34.669 --> 02:03:34.679 align:start position:0%
like we're going to get to those bills
 
02:03:37.910 --> 02:03:37.920 align:start position:0%
before the lunch break
 
02:03:41.209 --> 02:03:41.219 align:start position:0%
we might start the hearing on 68 before
 
02:03:43.669 --> 02:03:43.679 align:start position:0%
the lunch break I have over a dozen pink
 
02:03:47.450 --> 02:03:47.460 align:start position:0%
cards for Senate Bill 68 by itself
 
02:03:50.570 --> 02:03:50.580 align:start position:0%
so it's obviously going to turn into a
 
02:03:52.669 --> 02:03:52.679 align:start position:0%
longer day than what we had originally
 
02:03:52.679 --> 02:03:54.050 align:start position:0%
longer day than what we had originally
hoped

02:03:54.050 --> 02:03:54.060 align:start position:0%
hoped
 
02:03:57.169 --> 02:03:57.179 align:start position:0%
but I just wanted everyone everyone who
 
02:03:58.729 --> 02:03:58.739 align:start position:0%
is in the room here today and everybody
 
02:04:01.129 --> 02:04:01.139 align:start position:0%
watching from elsewhere to know
 
02:04:04.010 --> 02:04:04.020 align:start position:0%
what uh the plan is for the rest of the
 
02:04:06.589 --> 02:04:06.599 align:start position:0%
day and with that we'll call on Mr David
 
02:04:09.530 --> 02:04:09.540 align:start position:0%
cuzzy as the last speaker on this bill
 
02:04:12.169 --> 02:04:12.179 align:start position:0%
to give us his perspective on this
 
02:04:12.179 --> 02:04:19.629 align:start position:0%
to give us his perspective on this
legislation

02:04:19.629 --> 02:04:19.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:21.830 --> 02:04:21.840 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman good morning
 
02:04:24.229 --> 02:04:24.239 align:start position:0%
members of the committee my name is Dave
 
02:04:26.810 --> 02:04:26.820 align:start position:0%
cuzzy with Prospect Hill strategies here
 
02:04:29.209 --> 02:04:29.219 align:start position:0%
in town this morning uh before you on
 
02:04:31.669 --> 02:04:31.679 align:start position:0%
behalf of White Mountain paper
 
02:04:31.679 --> 02:04:33.290 align:start position:0%
behalf of White Mountain paper
um

02:04:33.290 --> 02:04:33.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:04:35.990 --> 02:04:36.000 align:start position:0%
White Mountain paper I guess this was uh
 
02:04:39.729 --> 02:04:39.739 align:start position:0%
as was stated previously where a paper
 
02:04:44.030 --> 02:04:44.040 align:start position:0%
manufacturing company so we don't have a
 
02:04:45.830 --> 02:04:45.840 align:start position:0%
dog in this fight except that we've now
 
02:04:48.709 --> 02:04:48.719 align:start position:0%
this has become I guess to be
 
02:04:51.950 --> 02:04:51.960 align:start position:0%
oversimplifying our problem or
 
02:04:54.950 --> 02:04:54.960 align:start position:0%
partly our problem and
 
02:04:58.609 --> 02:04:58.619 align:start position:0%
um so that's fine we have a good working
 
02:05:00.589 --> 02:05:00.599 align:start position:0%
relationship with Brookfield and that
 
02:05:03.790 --> 02:05:03.800 align:start position:0%
has allowed us to come to an agreement
 
02:05:07.070 --> 02:05:07.080 align:start position:0%
on language should this bill go forward
 
02:05:09.709 --> 02:05:09.719 align:start position:0%
that satisfies the concerns of White
 
02:05:11.870 --> 02:05:11.880 align:start position:0%
Mountain paper and gets us to a position
 
02:05:15.649 --> 02:05:15.659 align:start position:0%
of really no position on the bill the
 
02:05:17.450 --> 02:05:17.460 align:start position:0%
concerns were very simple for White
 
02:05:20.030 --> 02:05:20.040 align:start position:0%
Mountain uh we just as you may recall
 
02:05:22.129 --> 02:05:22.139 align:start position:0%
when we testify when I testified on
 
02:05:26.390 --> 02:05:26.400 align:start position:0%
behalf of the mill on House Bill 458 we
 
02:05:28.310 --> 02:05:28.320 align:start position:0%
were concerned we needed to make sure
 
02:05:30.290 --> 02:05:30.300 align:start position:0%
that this did not to confirm the
 
02:05:31.689 --> 02:05:31.699 align:start position:0%
suspicion that this bill would not
 
02:05:34.189 --> 02:05:34.199 align:start position:0%
impact the power purchase agreement
 
02:05:35.990 --> 02:05:36.000 align:start position:0%
that's in place through I believe 2031
 
02:05:38.450 --> 02:05:38.460 align:start position:0%
and that is that is the case this would
 
02:05:40.310 --> 02:05:40.320 align:start position:0%
not impact that PPA
 
02:05:42.649 --> 02:05:42.659 align:start position:0%
the other concern was and this is
 
02:05:44.950 --> 02:05:44.960 align:start position:0%
perhaps a little bit more nebulous but
 
02:05:47.390 --> 02:05:47.400 align:start position:0%
how would this impact
 
02:05:50.990 --> 02:05:51.000 align:start position:0%
the mill after the PPA just like any
 
02:05:54.050 --> 02:05:54.060 align:start position:0%
other business or well is the access to
 
02:05:57.229 --> 02:05:57.239 align:start position:0%
clean reliable and I guess affordable
 
02:06:00.109 --> 02:06:00.119 align:start position:0%
for New England but affordable power is
 
02:06:02.030 --> 02:06:02.040 align:start position:0%
of the essence of being able to do
 
02:06:04.250 --> 02:06:04.260 align:start position:0%
business and of course if you're in the
 
02:06:06.169 --> 02:06:06.179 align:start position:0%
the paper manufacturing business in the
 
02:06:08.570 --> 02:06:08.580 align:start position:0%
North Country even more important uh
 
02:06:10.010 --> 02:06:10.020 align:start position:0%
just given the volatility of that
 
02:06:13.129 --> 02:06:13.139 align:start position:0%
industry though the mill is on a path to
 
02:06:15.050 --> 02:06:15.060 align:start position:0%
sustainability and perhaps even growth
 
02:06:17.990 --> 02:06:18.000 align:start position:0%
the need for the mill to make sure that
 
02:06:19.609 --> 02:06:19.619 align:start position:0%
it was going to have access to that
 
02:06:23.390 --> 02:06:23.400 align:start position:0%
power after the PPA was was Paramount
 
02:06:25.790 --> 02:06:25.800 align:start position:0%
if I may Mr chairman I just want to take
 
02:06:26.870 --> 02:06:26.880 align:start position:0%
a minute to address some of the
 
02:06:30.050 --> 02:06:30.060 align:start position:0%
questions that were posed to other uh
 
02:06:30.060 --> 02:06:31.850 align:start position:0%
questions that were posed to other uh
testifiers

02:06:31.850 --> 02:06:31.860 align:start position:0%
testifiers
 
02:06:34.129 --> 02:06:34.139 align:start position:0%
um I have a I believe it was you Mr
 
02:06:35.629 --> 02:06:35.639 align:start position:0%
chairman asked what happens if the mill
 
02:06:38.390 --> 02:06:38.400 align:start position:0%
goes out of business and you know of
 
02:06:40.010 --> 02:06:40.020 align:start position:0%
course no one wants that but it's a
 
02:06:42.470 --> 02:06:42.480 align:start position:0%
reasonable question I would respectfully
 
02:06:44.270 --> 02:06:44.280 align:start position:0%
suggest that
 
02:06:44.280 --> 02:06:46.669 align:start position:0%
suggest that
um

02:06:46.669 --> 02:06:46.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:48.229 --> 02:06:48.239 align:start position:0%
if the mill were to go out of business
 
02:06:51.830 --> 02:06:51.840 align:start position:0%
the assets are still owned by uh Mr
 
02:06:54.229 --> 02:06:54.239 align:start position:0%
Behrens the the owner of the of the mill
 
02:06:56.930 --> 02:06:56.940 align:start position:0%
and he would he or his
 
02:07:00.229 --> 02:07:00.239 align:start position:0%
company would still be the customer
 
02:07:03.350 --> 02:07:03.360 align:start position:0%
utility of record at the interconnection
 
02:07:06.649 --> 02:07:06.659 align:start position:0%
and that is an asset that would be sold
 
02:07:08.810 --> 02:07:08.820 align:start position:0%
if the it would be in play so I don't
 
02:07:10.550 --> 02:07:10.560 align:start position:0%
just because the mill may not be
 
02:07:12.950 --> 02:07:12.960 align:start position:0%
operating doesn't mean that all of a
 
02:07:15.709 --> 02:07:15.719 align:start position:0%
sudden Brookfield just becomes
 
02:07:18.350 --> 02:07:18.360 align:start position:0%
the customer of record I'm not an
 
02:07:21.350 --> 02:07:21.360 align:start position:0%
attorney but that would be my assumption
 
02:07:23.450 --> 02:07:23.460 align:start position:0%
that that's still part of the property
 
02:07:26.149 --> 02:07:26.159 align:start position:0%
and there still would be uh you know the
 
02:07:28.070 --> 02:07:28.080 align:start position:0%
owner of that facility would still need
 
02:07:30.290 --> 02:07:30.300 align:start position:0%
power just to make sure the buildings
 
02:07:33.109 --> 02:07:33.119 align:start position:0%
are are safe and whatnot
 
02:07:35.750 --> 02:07:35.760 align:start position:0%
um so I wanted to address that
 
02:07:35.760 --> 02:07:36.470 align:start position:0%
um so I wanted to address that
um

02:07:36.470 --> 02:07:36.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:07:38.570 --> 02:07:38.580 align:start position:0%
representative I believe you asked the
 
02:07:40.370 --> 02:07:40.380 align:start position:0%
question about you know why not just
 
02:07:43.729 --> 02:07:43.739 align:start position:0%
open up the PPA and uh you know for for
 
02:07:46.490 --> 02:07:46.500 align:start position:0%
White Mountain again this was I guess
 
02:07:48.350 --> 02:07:48.360 align:start position:0%
not necessarily our problem to solve
 
02:07:50.870 --> 02:07:50.880 align:start position:0%
respectfully I don't mean to be trite uh
 
02:07:50.880 --> 02:07:52.070 align:start position:0%
respectfully I don't mean to be trite uh
but

02:07:52.070 --> 02:07:52.080 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:07:55.490 --> 02:07:55.500 align:start position:0%
uh just making sure that the company had
 
02:07:56.870 --> 02:07:56.880 align:start position:0%
to spend thousands of dollars on
 
02:07:58.910 --> 02:07:58.920 align:start position:0%
attorneys on attorney fees just to make
 
02:07:58.920 --> 02:07:59.810 align:start position:0%
attorneys on attorney fees just to make
sure

02:07:59.810 --> 02:07:59.820 align:start position:0%
sure
 
02:08:01.810 --> 02:08:01.820 align:start position:0%
we got to a position where we are today
 
02:08:05.330 --> 02:08:05.340 align:start position:0%
the PPA was many thousands of dollars to
 
02:08:07.550 --> 02:08:07.560 align:start position:0%
negotiate that a few years ago and it
 
02:08:10.070 --> 02:08:10.080 align:start position:0%
was just not an expense the company saw
 
02:08:13.189 --> 02:08:13.199 align:start position:0%
the need to uh to do for a problem that
 
02:08:15.830 --> 02:08:15.840 align:start position:0%
you know really isn't isn't theirs if
 
02:08:17.689 --> 02:08:17.699 align:start position:0%
you will but happy to do so for the
 
02:08:19.729 --> 02:08:19.739 align:start position:0%
point of this legislation
 
02:08:21.709 --> 02:08:21.719 align:start position:0%
um you know to work cooperatively with
 
02:08:23.629 --> 02:08:23.639 align:start position:0%
with Brookfield
 
02:08:23.639 --> 02:08:24.890 align:start position:0%
with Brookfield
um

02:08:24.890 --> 02:08:24.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:08:27.950 --> 02:08:27.960 align:start position:0%
so that really Mr chairman is is well I
 
02:08:30.709 --> 02:08:30.719 align:start position:0%
think the the questions that uh I heard
 
02:08:32.810 --> 02:08:32.820 align:start position:0%
I I believe representative bonds may
 
02:08:34.430 --> 02:08:34.440 align:start position:0%
have had one that I'm and I'm blanking
 
02:08:36.229 --> 02:08:36.239 align:start position:0%
on that that I meant to address and I
 
02:08:36.239 --> 02:08:37.669 align:start position:0%
on that that I meant to address and I
apologize

02:08:37.669 --> 02:08:37.679 align:start position:0%
apologize
 
02:08:40.250 --> 02:08:40.260 align:start position:0%
um on the underlying policy concerns
 
02:08:43.010 --> 02:08:43.020 align:start position:0%
regarding if it's the legality or
 
02:08:44.870 --> 02:08:44.880 align:start position:0%
constitutionality of the bill or the
 
02:08:44.880 --> 02:08:46.250 align:start position:0%
constitutionality of the bill or the
amendment

02:08:46.250 --> 02:08:46.260 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
02:08:48.890 --> 02:08:48.900 align:start position:0%
um or the overarching policy discussion
 
02:08:50.330 --> 02:08:50.340 align:start position:0%
about the definition of customer
 
02:08:52.370 --> 02:08:52.380 align:start position:0%
generator White Mountain as you might
 
02:08:55.250 --> 02:08:55.260 align:start position:0%
expect uh has no no position on that so
 
02:08:57.290 --> 02:08:57.300 align:start position:0%
I just want to make that clear that the
 
02:08:59.629 --> 02:08:59.639 align:start position:0%
goal really was to make sure that
 
02:09:02.330 --> 02:09:02.340 align:start position:0%
uh very simply been I know this sounds
 
02:09:04.010 --> 02:09:04.020 align:start position:0%
selfish but our interests of course were
 
02:09:04.020 --> 02:09:05.450 align:start position:0%
selfish but our interests of course were
protected

02:09:05.450 --> 02:09:05.460 align:start position:0%
protected
 
02:09:07.189 --> 02:09:07.199 align:start position:0%
um Brookfield negotiated with us in good
 
02:09:09.470 --> 02:09:09.480 align:start position:0%
faith to make sure that uh it was
 
02:09:10.790 --> 02:09:10.800 align:start position:0%
clarified that they were only talking
 
02:09:13.070 --> 02:09:13.080 align:start position:0%
about excess generation and that the
 
02:09:15.290 --> 02:09:15.300 align:start position:0%
needs of the mill are served whether
 
02:09:16.490 --> 02:09:16.500 align:start position:0%
it's zero
 
02:09:19.010 --> 02:09:19.020 align:start position:0%
or you know double or more what it is
 
02:09:21.589 --> 02:09:21.599 align:start position:0%
right now we wanted to make sure that
 
02:09:23.209 --> 02:09:23.219 align:start position:0%
that was that that was something that
 
02:09:25.310 --> 02:09:25.320 align:start position:0%
protected the mill uh and that that's
 
02:09:26.930 --> 02:09:26.940 align:start position:0%
all I had for my remarks Mr chairman
 
02:09:28.669 --> 02:09:28.679 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:09:30.530 --> 02:09:30.540 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr cousin we appreciate you
 
02:09:32.089 --> 02:09:32.099 align:start position:0%
being here this morning we have some
 
02:09:33.470 --> 02:09:33.480 align:start position:0%
questions for you representative
 
02:09:35.870 --> 02:09:35.880 align:start position:0%
Harrington has one thank you Mr chairman
 
02:09:37.669 --> 02:09:37.679 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question um we
 
02:09:39.830 --> 02:09:39.840 align:start position:0%
keep talking about this PPA so what
 
02:09:41.629 --> 02:09:41.639 align:start position:0%
exactly what's the price that's being
 
02:09:43.790 --> 02:09:43.800 align:start position:0%
paid there thank you for the question
 
02:09:45.229 --> 02:09:45.239 align:start position:0%
representative I don't know the answer
 
02:09:47.089 --> 02:09:47.099 align:start position:0%
to that I could certainly get that uh
 
02:09:48.589 --> 02:09:48.599 align:start position:0%
assuming that that both parties are
 
02:09:50.770 --> 02:09:50.780 align:start position:0%
comfortable sharing all right well
 
02:09:53.570 --> 02:09:53.580 align:start position:0%
people are asking to a special attention
 
02:09:55.370 --> 02:09:55.380 align:start position:0%
from the state to have a bill passed
 
02:09:56.990 --> 02:09:57.000 align:start position:0%
just for them so I think that
 
02:09:58.430 --> 02:09:58.440 align:start position:0%
information should be shared with the
 
02:10:00.470 --> 02:10:00.480 align:start position:0%
public fair point but although to be
 
02:10:02.689 --> 02:10:02.699 align:start position:0%
clear White Mountain paper is not asking
 
02:10:05.030 --> 02:10:05.040 align:start position:0%
uh not asking for that but I'll I'll get
 
02:10:07.070 --> 02:10:07.080 align:start position:0%
I'll get that info to the extent I can
 
02:10:09.050 --> 02:10:09.060 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:10:10.970 --> 02:10:10.980 align:start position:0%
representative Munns has a question
 
02:10:12.950 --> 02:10:12.960 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and
 
02:10:14.990 --> 02:10:15.000 align:start position:0%
don't feel bad about blanking on my
 
02:10:16.490 --> 02:10:16.500 align:start position:0%
question because that happens to me all
 
02:10:17.930 --> 02:10:17.940 align:start position:0%
the time with my wife so thank you
 
02:10:19.490 --> 02:10:19.500 align:start position:0%
that's going to say the same thing about
 
02:10:19.500 --> 02:10:21.109 align:start position:0%
that's going to say the same thing about
me

02:10:21.109 --> 02:10:21.119 align:start position:0%
me
 
02:10:21.119 --> 02:10:22.370 align:start position:0%
me
um

02:10:22.370 --> 02:10:22.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:10:24.589 --> 02:10:24.599 align:start position:0%
but on the PPA
 
02:10:26.870 --> 02:10:26.880 align:start position:0%
um so you know what I heard you say and
 
02:10:28.070 --> 02:10:28.080 align:start position:0%
and I don't want to put words in your
 
02:10:29.510 --> 02:10:29.520 align:start position:0%
mouth well I heard you say was it was
 
02:10:33.109 --> 02:10:33.119 align:start position:0%
the cost to actually negotiate the PPA
 
02:10:34.910 --> 02:10:34.920 align:start position:0%
the legal expenses that was a concern of
 
02:10:38.750 --> 02:10:38.760 align:start position:0%
White Mountain if those costs were paid
 
02:10:41.870 --> 02:10:41.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:44.689 --> 02:10:44.699 align:start position:0%
um would that remove your reluctance to
 
02:10:46.729 --> 02:10:46.739 align:start position:0%
open up the PPA and maybe talk about a
 
02:10:49.070 --> 02:10:49.080 align:start position:0%
solution that does not require a
 
02:10:50.689 --> 02:10:50.699 align:start position:0%
legislative solution
 
02:10:53.930 --> 02:10:53.940 align:start position:0%
it would remove a
 
02:10:59.470 --> 02:10:59.480 align:start position:0%
a barrier or a concern but I I think
 
02:11:01.970 --> 02:11:01.980 align:start position:0%
as you know we were going through this
 
02:11:04.430 --> 02:11:04.440 align:start position:0%
on the White Mountain Side you know
 
02:11:06.609 --> 02:11:06.619 align:start position:0%
they're they're trying to keep a mill
 
02:11:09.890 --> 02:11:09.900 align:start position:0%
sustainable and that gets the attention
 
02:11:13.129 --> 02:11:13.139 align:start position:0%
right up to the owner and so I think the
 
02:11:16.550 --> 02:11:16.560 align:start position:0%
the thought of opening up a PPA that was
 
02:11:19.189 --> 02:11:19.199 align:start position:0%
um you know took quite a lot of time and
 
02:11:22.669 --> 02:11:22.679 align:start position:0%
effort to come to agreement on just
 
02:11:25.550 --> 02:11:25.560 align:start position:0%
two years ago two years ago
 
02:11:28.550 --> 02:11:28.560 align:start position:0%
um is just not something that anyone
 
02:11:30.530 --> 02:11:30.540 align:start position:0%
thinks would be a good use of of
 
02:11:32.450 --> 02:11:32.460 align:start position:0%
anyone's time I think
 
02:11:34.669 --> 02:11:34.679 align:start position:0%
you know the concern is that all these
 
02:11:34.679 --> 02:11:36.010 align:start position:0%
you know the concern is that all these
administrative

02:11:36.010 --> 02:11:36.020 align:start position:0%
administrative
 
02:11:38.149 --> 02:11:38.159 align:start position:0%
really what you'd be talking about is
 
02:11:39.470 --> 02:11:39.480 align:start position:0%
you'd be shifting a lot of the
 
02:11:41.570 --> 02:11:41.580 align:start position:0%
administrative burden onto
 
02:11:43.790 --> 02:11:43.800 align:start position:0%
White Mountain and
 
02:11:45.350 --> 02:11:45.360 align:start position:0%
it's just not something that they're
 
02:11:46.669 --> 02:11:46.679 align:start position:0%
interested in doing even if it were
 
02:11:48.830 --> 02:11:48.840 align:start position:0%
somehow done by someone else it just
 
02:11:51.830 --> 02:11:51.840 align:start position:0%
becomes very difficult and just not
 
02:11:53.930 --> 02:11:53.940 align:start position:0%
something that the mill
 
02:11:59.030 --> 02:11:59.040 align:start position:0%
wants or needs in terms of its focus on
 
02:12:02.510 --> 02:12:02.520 align:start position:0%
making that Mill sustainable uh and and
 
02:12:05.450 --> 02:12:05.460 align:start position:0%
even uh you know position for growth
 
02:12:06.770 --> 02:12:06.780 align:start position:0%
down the road which is really what's
 
02:12:09.129 --> 02:12:09.139 align:start position:0%
most important for the North Country I'd
 
02:12:12.290 --> 02:12:12.300 align:start position:0%
respectfully suggest
 
02:12:14.270 --> 02:12:14.280 align:start position:0%
I don't know I hope that answers your
 
02:12:15.770 --> 02:12:15.780 align:start position:0%
question I'm happy to give it another
 
02:12:17.870 --> 02:12:17.880 align:start position:0%
shot if you like well if follow-up
 
02:12:19.910 --> 02:12:19.920 align:start position:0%
follow up well I guess what I'm trying
 
02:12:21.530 --> 02:12:21.540 align:start position:0%
to understand and I appreciate that this
 
02:12:24.649 --> 02:12:24.659 align:start position:0%
isn't this isn't your your your hunt
 
02:12:27.530 --> 02:12:27.540 align:start position:0%
um but um trying to see if there's a way
 
02:12:29.930 --> 02:12:29.940 align:start position:0%
if there's you know if a way where
 
02:12:32.990 --> 02:12:33.000 align:start position:0%
you're kept whole where you know any
 
02:12:35.149 --> 02:12:35.159 align:start position:0%
additional costs any additional effort
 
02:12:37.490 --> 02:12:37.500 align:start position:0%
that you know you're required to do if
 
02:12:39.830 --> 02:12:39.840 align:start position:0%
you're kept whole is there is there
 
02:12:42.169 --> 02:12:42.179 align:start position:0%
possibly a solution that doesn't involve
 
02:12:44.270 --> 02:12:44.280 align:start position:0%
as representative Harrington said you
 
02:12:46.669 --> 02:12:46.679 align:start position:0%
know the legislature basically creating
 
02:12:48.770 --> 02:12:48.780 align:start position:0%
a special provision
 
02:12:51.290 --> 02:12:51.300 align:start position:0%
for uh you know one one particular
 
02:12:54.770 --> 02:12:54.780 align:start position:0%
situation in a vacuum respectfully
 
02:12:54.780 --> 02:12:56.270 align:start position:0%
situation in a vacuum respectfully
sure

02:12:56.270 --> 02:12:56.280 align:start position:0%
sure
 
02:12:59.629 --> 02:12:59.639 align:start position:0%
um but I you know again respectfully not
 
02:13:01.270 --> 02:13:01.280 align:start position:0%
operating in a vacuum
 
02:13:03.770 --> 02:13:03.780 align:start position:0%
I guess that that still would be a path
 
02:13:05.450 --> 02:13:05.460 align:start position:0%
I just I guess what I'm saying
 
02:13:07.250 --> 02:13:07.260 align:start position:0%
representative is that I don't think
 
02:13:09.950 --> 02:13:09.960 align:start position:0%
it's a path the mill has any interest in
 
02:13:13.069 --> 02:13:13.079 align:start position:0%
in taking I I suppose anything's
 
02:13:15.050 --> 02:13:15.060 align:start position:0%
possible but as we sit here today I I
 
02:13:17.510 --> 02:13:17.520 align:start position:0%
just I don't see that path and I I
 
02:13:17.520 --> 02:13:18.950 align:start position:0%
just I don't see that path and I I
believe

02:13:18.950 --> 02:13:18.960 align:start position:0%
believe
 
02:13:21.530 --> 02:13:21.540 align:start position:0%
that that Brookfield shares that I don't
 
02:13:22.910 --> 02:13:22.920 align:start position:0%
mean to be speaking for Brookfield but I
 
02:13:24.709 --> 02:13:24.719 align:start position:0%
think they made comments similar to that
 
02:13:24.719 --> 02:13:28.129 align:start position:0%
think they made comments similar to that
prior

02:13:28.129 --> 02:13:28.139 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:31.970 --> 02:13:31.980 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:34.310 --> 02:13:34.320 align:start position:0%
okay seeing no further questions from
 
02:13:35.810 --> 02:13:35.820 align:start position:0%
the committee I want to thank you very
 
02:13:37.850 --> 02:13:37.860 align:start position:0%
much for being here to testify thank you
 
02:13:39.109 --> 02:13:39.119 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman
 
02:13:41.270 --> 02:13:41.280 align:start position:0%
and with that since we have no more pink
 
02:13:43.010 --> 02:13:43.020 align:start position:0%
cards on this bill
 
02:13:46.729 --> 02:13:46.739 align:start position:0%
I will uh close the public hearing on
 
02:13:49.430 --> 02:13:49.440 align:start position:0%
this legislation and ask representative
 
02:13:52.669 --> 02:13:52.679 align:start position:0%
closure to give us a count on the

electrical energy producers
 
02:14:50.870 --> 02:14:50.880 align:start position:0%
representative partial did you have a
 
02:14:52.790 --> 02:14:52.800 align:start position:0%
question yes thank you chair that's for
 
02:14:54.530 --> 02:14:54.540 align:start position:0%
those that have come in more recently
 
02:14:57.589 --> 02:14:57.599 align:start position:0%
could you repeat uh your for earlier
 
02:14:59.870 --> 02:14:59.880 align:start position:0%
comments about how we're running late we
 
02:15:02.330 --> 02:15:02.340 align:start position:0%
will be running over the Lunch Period
 
02:15:06.050 --> 02:15:06.060 align:start position:0%
okay so we are running late
 
02:15:08.510 --> 02:15:08.520 align:start position:0%
originally this public hearing was
 
02:15:11.750 --> 02:15:11.760 align:start position:0%
scheduled for 10 a.m it's now 11 21.
 
02:15:14.209 --> 02:15:14.219 align:start position:0%
we will start this public hearing now I
 
02:15:17.569 --> 02:15:17.579 align:start position:0%
have at least a dozen pink cards of
 
02:15:20.270 --> 02:15:20.280 align:start position:0%
folks who want to testify on this uh
 
02:15:22.550 --> 02:15:22.560 align:start position:0%
particular piece of legislation so it's
 
02:15:24.890 --> 02:15:24.900 align:start position:0%
going to be a while before we finish
 
02:15:26.209 --> 02:15:26.219 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
02:15:28.129 --> 02:15:28.139 align:start position:0%
and we will probably take a lunch break
 
02:15:30.290 --> 02:15:30.300 align:start position:0%
in the middle of this Public public
 
02:15:32.810 --> 02:15:32.820 align:start position:0%
hearing so we'll start it now we'll
 
02:15:34.910 --> 02:15:34.920 align:start position:0%
complete it after lunch
 
02:15:38.209 --> 02:15:38.219 align:start position:0%
and then we'll move on to the second the
 
02:15:40.069 --> 02:15:40.079 align:start position:0%
other two bills on the calendar which
 
02:15:45.530 --> 02:15:45.540 align:start position:0%
are 69 and 79 sometime this afternoon
 
02:15:48.470 --> 02:15:48.480 align:start position:0%
so let's get the show started by calling
 
02:15:51.950 --> 02:15:51.960 align:start position:0%
on Senator Waters to introduce this
 
02:15:54.589 --> 02:15:54.599 align:start position:0%
legislation which was originally
 
02:15:58.189 --> 02:15:58.199 align:start position:0%
sponsored by senator avard
 
02:16:00.530 --> 02:16:00.540 align:start position:0%
so Senator Waters
 
02:16:02.689 --> 02:16:02.699 align:start position:0%
give us a an indication of what this
 
02:16:04.550 --> 02:16:04.560 align:start position:0%
bill is all about thank you thank you Mr
 
02:16:06.470 --> 02:16:06.480 align:start position:0%
chairman members of the committee I'm
 
02:16:08.870 --> 02:16:08.880 align:start position:0%
introducing this on behalf of Senator
 
02:16:10.910 --> 02:16:10.920 align:start position:0%
avard the once again I was a co-sponsor
 
02:16:13.189 --> 02:16:13.199 align:start position:0%
along with the senator pearl of this
 
02:16:16.149 --> 02:16:16.159 align:start position:0%
bill this is
 
02:16:19.010 --> 02:16:19.020 align:start position:0%
maybe not quite a technical change but
 
02:16:21.709 --> 02:16:21.719 align:start position:0%
as it changes the definition of
 
02:16:24.649 --> 02:16:24.659 align:start position:0%
Municipal host as you will see in line
 
02:16:27.830 --> 02:16:27.840 align:start position:0%
six through eight in the bill it strikes
 
02:16:29.930 --> 02:16:29.940 align:start position:0%
the municipal hose shall be located in
 
02:16:31.310 --> 02:16:31.320 align:start position:0%
the same municipality as all group
 
02:16:33.290 --> 02:16:33.300 align:start position:0%
members if the facility began operating
 
02:16:36.250 --> 02:16:36.260 align:start position:0%
after January 1st 20
 
02:16:40.190 --> 02:16:40.200 align:start position:0%
21. and as as you know well that one
 
02:16:43.610 --> 02:16:43.620 align:start position:0%
Governor sununu signed uh House Bill 315
 
02:16:45.709 --> 02:16:45.719 align:start position:0%
Municipal net metering projects were
 
02:16:47.870 --> 02:16:47.880 align:start position:0%
expanded uh to allowed up to five
 
02:16:50.570 --> 02:16:50.580 align:start position:0%
megawatts we know from the industry by
 
02:16:52.250 --> 02:16:52.260 align:start position:0%
this point the three to five megawatts
 
02:16:54.950 --> 02:16:54.960 align:start position:0%
is the kind of sweet spot where these
 
02:16:57.650 --> 02:16:57.660 align:start position:0%
projects uh can deliver low-cost energy
 
02:16:59.570 --> 02:16:59.580 align:start position:0%
that can still under our statues be
 
02:17:02.929 --> 02:17:02.939 align:start position:0%
integrated into the power grid the the
 
02:17:05.030 --> 02:17:05.040 align:start position:0%
issue with the definition here is that
 
02:17:06.709 --> 02:17:06.719 align:start position:0%
some Municipal
 
02:17:10.270 --> 02:17:10.280 align:start position:0%
um hosts are having difficulty finding
 
02:17:13.669 --> 02:17:13.679 align:start position:0%
enough use of the power under this
 
02:17:13.679 --> 02:17:14.589 align:start position:0%
enough use of the power under this
definition

02:17:14.589 --> 02:17:14.599 align:start position:0%
definition
 
02:17:18.230 --> 02:17:18.240 align:start position:0%
by Partners to be able to hit that three
 
02:17:19.849 --> 02:17:19.859 align:start position:0%
to five megawatts where the project
 
02:17:22.190 --> 02:17:22.200 align:start position:0%
makes Financial
 
02:17:23.929 --> 02:17:23.939 align:start position:0%
um sense so what it would let you do is
 
02:17:25.669 --> 02:17:25.679 align:start position:0%
kind of team up and enter into that
 
02:17:29.629 --> 02:17:29.639 align:start position:0%
metering projects with some other
 
02:17:33.049 --> 02:17:33.059 align:start position:0%
entities for example let's say a group
 
02:17:34.610 --> 02:17:34.620 align:start position:0%
of saus
 
02:17:37.429 --> 02:17:37.439 align:start position:0%
or let's say a city hall plus a
 
02:17:40.129 --> 02:17:40.139 align:start position:0%
wastewater treatment plant that might
 
02:17:42.110 --> 02:17:42.120 align:start position:0%
serve a community but not be in a
 
02:17:44.570 --> 02:17:44.580 align:start position:0%
municipality admissible area
 
02:17:46.969 --> 02:17:46.979 align:start position:0%
um that if they could put a partnership
 
02:17:49.429 --> 02:17:49.439 align:start position:0%
together like this or a hospital and
 
02:17:52.129 --> 02:17:52.139 align:start position:0%
some other entity then they would be
 
02:17:53.629 --> 02:17:53.639 align:start position:0%
able to
 
02:17:53.639 --> 02:17:54.410 align:start position:0%
able to
um

02:17:54.410 --> 02:17:54.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:17:56.629 --> 02:17:56.639 align:start position:0%
have a project and sell the energy back
 
02:17:59.209 --> 02:17:59.219 align:start position:0%
into the grid
 
02:18:01.669 --> 02:18:01.679 align:start position:0%
um and you know just for background
 
02:18:04.070 --> 02:18:04.080 align:start position:0%
there are about 10 Municipal hosts net
 
02:18:05.810 --> 02:18:05.820 align:start position:0%
metering projects in New Hampshire right
 
02:18:07.969 --> 02:18:07.979 align:start position:0%
now so we know this works and the
 
02:18:11.270 --> 02:18:11.280 align:start position:0%
feeling is that this change would allow
 
02:18:13.310 --> 02:18:13.320 align:start position:0%
more municipalities under the five
 
02:18:15.830 --> 02:18:15.840 align:start position:0%
megawatt limit to have financially
 
02:18:19.250 --> 02:18:19.260 align:start position:0%
feasible and keep power lower in cost
 
02:18:22.429 --> 02:18:22.439 align:start position:0%
for uh customers in New Hampshire so
 
02:18:26.270 --> 02:18:26.280 align:start position:0%
that is it Mr chairman
 
02:18:29.089 --> 02:18:29.099 align:start position:0%
thank you Senator Waters a good
 
02:18:34.429 --> 02:18:34.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:35.870 --> 02:18:35.880 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
02:18:38.509 --> 02:18:38.519 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington has one thank
 
02:18:40.129 --> 02:18:40.139 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman thank you for taking my
 
02:18:42.049 --> 02:18:42.059 align:start position:0%
question you said something and maybe it
 
02:18:44.089 --> 02:18:44.099 align:start position:0%
was just a misspoke you said if they
 
02:18:46.310 --> 02:18:46.320 align:start position:0%
were to go with a hospital but my
 
02:18:48.230 --> 02:18:48.240 align:start position:0%
reading of this bill it would have to be
 
02:18:51.830 --> 02:18:51.840 align:start position:0%
a excuse me political subdivision my
 
02:18:53.450 --> 02:18:53.460 align:start position:0%
error I don't know I think I was
 
02:18:54.530 --> 02:18:54.540 align:start position:0%
thinking another bill we're going to
 
02:18:57.169 --> 02:18:57.179 align:start position:0%
have thank you but my Aaron thank you
 
02:18:59.389 --> 02:18:59.399 align:start position:0%
for correctly Mr representative
 
02:18:59.399 --> 02:19:00.549 align:start position:0%
for correctly Mr representative
Harrington

02:19:00.549 --> 02:19:00.559 align:start position:0%
Harrington
 
02:19:02.629 --> 02:19:02.639 align:start position:0%
representative Summers has a question
 
02:19:04.549 --> 02:19:04.559 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
02:19:05.990 --> 02:19:06.000 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
02:19:09.410 --> 02:19:09.420 align:start position:0%
uh just just recently in the house we we
 
02:19:12.589 --> 02:19:12.599 align:start position:0%
had hb139 and we looking at that this
 
02:19:15.169 --> 02:19:15.179 align:start position:0%
actually this bill and other than adding
 
02:19:17.570 --> 02:19:17.580 align:start position:0%
The quasi-public Entity and we just
 
02:19:19.849 --> 02:19:19.859 align:start position:0%
argued this in the house it seems It's
 
02:19:21.770 --> 02:19:21.780 align:start position:0%
the exact same bill the exact same
 
02:19:24.349 --> 02:19:24.359 align:start position:0%
change so just a limit questioning is
 
02:19:27.589 --> 02:19:27.599 align:start position:0%
that the only change or difference
 
02:19:29.330 --> 02:19:29.340 align:start position:0%
um you know I just looked at 139 but I
 
02:19:30.230 --> 02:19:30.240 align:start position:0%
don't have a thanks for your question I
 
02:19:32.150 --> 02:19:32.160 align:start position:0%
don't have it in uh right in front of me
 
02:19:34.250 --> 02:19:34.260 align:start position:0%
but um I think what is different here is
 
02:19:35.870 --> 02:19:35.880 align:start position:0%
that um
 
02:19:38.870 --> 02:19:38.880 align:start position:0%
located in the same municipality
 
02:19:41.690 --> 02:19:41.700 align:start position:0%
okay I think that's different and not
 
02:19:46.570 --> 02:19:46.580 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:48.830 --> 02:19:48.840 align:start position:0%
representative Summers did you have a
 
02:19:48.840 --> 02:19:50.210 align:start position:0%
representative Summers did you have a
follow-up

02:19:50.210 --> 02:19:50.220 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
02:19:54.170 --> 02:19:54.180 align:start position:0%
um yes it does have the uh it basically
 
02:19:56.030 --> 02:19:56.040 align:start position:0%
strikes out the exact same line that you
 
02:19:57.710 --> 02:19:57.720 align:start position:0%
have struck out here
 
02:19:59.510 --> 02:19:59.520 align:start position:0%
um the only thing it adds is the housing
 
02:20:02.750 --> 02:20:02.760 align:start position:0%
authority and a quasi-public entity so
 
02:20:05.929 --> 02:20:05.939 align:start position:0%
um and uh the peas Development Authority
 
02:20:07.310 --> 02:20:07.320 align:start position:0%
um I know we just had this on the house
 
02:20:09.170 --> 02:20:09.180 align:start position:0%
last house session this already went
 
02:20:10.429 --> 02:20:10.439 align:start position:0%
through and we passed it through and we
 
02:20:12.170 --> 02:20:12.180 align:start position:0%
went through committee here
 
02:20:15.110 --> 02:20:15.120 align:start position:0%
um but uh just wanted to see if these
 
02:20:16.849 --> 02:20:16.859 align:start position:0%
are basically two mirrored bills and it
 
02:20:20.870 --> 02:20:20.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:26.389 --> 02:20:26.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:29.030 --> 02:20:29.040 align:start position:0%
seeing none we'll move along since we
 
02:20:31.429 --> 02:20:31.439 align:start position:0%
have a lot well representative Bernardi
 
02:20:34.130 --> 02:20:34.140 align:start position:0%
has a question thank you Mr chairman so
 
02:20:36.590 --> 02:20:36.600 align:start position:0%
do you have an estimated number of how
 
02:20:40.130 --> 02:20:40.140 align:start position:0%
many uh uh potential new facilities
 
02:20:40.140 --> 02:20:41.270 align:start position:0%
many uh uh potential new facilities
would

02:20:41.270 --> 02:20:41.280 align:start position:0%
would
 
02:20:43.610 --> 02:20:43.620 align:start position:0%
would be interested in this particular
 
02:20:43.620 --> 02:20:45.770 align:start position:0%
would be interested in this particular
revision

02:20:45.770 --> 02:20:45.780 align:start position:0%
revision
 
02:20:49.790 --> 02:20:49.800 align:start position:0%
uh no I don't and um
 
02:20:51.889 --> 02:20:51.899 align:start position:0%
you know it's an individual decision by
 
02:20:54.050 --> 02:20:54.060 align:start position:0%
a municipality
 
02:20:55.429 --> 02:20:55.439 align:start position:0%
um I expect that there will be interest
 
02:20:57.650 --> 02:20:57.660 align:start position:0%
I think considering what we have seen
 
02:21:01.550 --> 02:21:01.560 align:start position:0%
about Community power and the reduction
 
02:21:03.950 --> 02:21:03.960 align:start position:0%
of costs available through that and new
 
02:21:06.230 --> 02:21:06.240 align:start position:0%
entities joining Community power that
 
02:21:08.870 --> 02:21:08.880 align:start position:0%
there might be further interest for
 
02:21:11.750 --> 02:21:11.760 align:start position:0%
those communities to look at this
 
02:21:13.730 --> 02:21:13.740 align:start position:0%
program as well to not just purchase
 
02:21:16.790 --> 02:21:16.800 align:start position:0%
power to benefit their Community but
 
02:21:18.530 --> 02:21:18.540 align:start position:0%
also to start doing some of these
 
02:21:20.270 --> 02:21:20.280 align:start position:0%
projects as well so
 
02:21:22.730 --> 02:21:22.740 align:start position:0%
I don't know but I I suspect that people
 
02:21:25.490 --> 02:21:25.500 align:start position:0%
will that this would be a
 
02:21:27.530 --> 02:21:27.540 align:start position:0%
um a good way to let these things become
 
02:21:29.210 --> 02:21:29.220 align:start position:0%
economically feasible for more
 
02:21:29.220 --> 02:21:30.590 align:start position:0%
economically feasible for more
municipalities

02:21:30.590 --> 02:21:30.600 align:start position:0%
municipalities
 
02:21:33.230 --> 02:21:33.240 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:21:35.570 --> 02:21:35.580 align:start position:0%
okay I have a question for you Senator
 
02:21:37.550 --> 02:21:37.560 align:start position:0%
we keep hearing
 
02:21:39.410 --> 02:21:39.420 align:start position:0%
and I think you referred to this
 
02:21:41.710 --> 02:21:41.720 align:start position:0%
yourself and your testimony that
 
02:21:46.070 --> 02:21:46.080 align:start position:0%
municipalities don't have enough load to
 
02:21:49.610 --> 02:21:49.620 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:52.010 --> 02:21:52.020 align:start position:0%
well let's assume that a municipality
 
02:21:54.530 --> 02:21:54.540 align:start position:0%
had 1.5 megawatts of load why don't they
 
02:21:57.410 --> 02:21:57.420 align:start position:0%
just build a 1.5 megawatt system why do
 
02:21:58.910 --> 02:21:58.920 align:start position:0%
they need to build a five megawatt
 
02:21:58.920 --> 02:22:00.710 align:start position:0%
they need to build a five megawatt
system

02:22:00.710 --> 02:22:00.720 align:start position:0%
system
 
02:22:02.929 --> 02:22:02.939 align:start position:0%
well um thanks for the question Mr
 
02:22:04.490 --> 02:22:04.500 align:start position:0%
chairman and I I think we may have some
 
02:22:06.770 --> 02:22:06.780 align:start position:0%
industry folks on your list but you know
 
02:22:08.990 --> 02:22:09.000 align:start position:0%
I think it's very clear
 
02:22:11.870 --> 02:22:11.880 align:start position:0%
that the economics
 
02:22:15.050 --> 02:22:15.060 align:start position:0%
um of of that size system doesn't really
 
02:22:17.510 --> 02:22:17.520 align:start position:0%
cut it to get a low price at actual
 
02:22:20.929 --> 02:22:20.939 align:start position:0%
lower energy costs for the air for the
 
02:22:22.849 --> 02:22:22.859 align:start position:0%
for the users
 
02:22:24.950 --> 02:22:24.960 align:start position:0%
um I will give you an example that I
 
02:22:28.490 --> 02:22:28.500 align:start position:0%
know of in my own Community where there
 
02:22:30.410 --> 02:22:30.420 align:start position:0%
was a question about if we put solar at
 
02:22:32.929 --> 02:22:32.939 align:start position:0%
the highest the new High School
 
02:22:35.630 --> 02:22:35.640 align:start position:0%
um then would that would the could the
 
02:22:38.150 --> 02:22:38.160 align:start position:0%
project be done at what level
 
02:22:41.150 --> 02:22:41.160 align:start position:0%
and how many megawatts that the investor
 
02:22:43.730 --> 02:22:43.740 align:start position:0%
was willing to build the project and the
 
02:22:46.250 --> 02:22:46.260 align:start position:0%
power would be something that would
 
02:22:48.110 --> 02:22:48.120 align:start position:0%
undercut the cost of other available
 
02:22:50.870 --> 02:22:50.880 align:start position:0%
power and I and I think that you know
 
02:22:51.889 --> 02:22:51.899 align:start position:0%
the what Dover and some other
 
02:22:53.030 --> 02:22:53.040 align:start position:0%
communities have gone through is that
 
02:22:54.650 --> 02:22:54.660 align:start position:0%
you just really can't make the numbers
 
02:22:57.410 --> 02:22:57.420 align:start position:0%
work very well and that's that is in
 
02:23:00.650 --> 02:23:00.660 align:start position:0%
fact why under 315 Mr chairman we raised
 
02:23:03.230 --> 02:23:03.240 align:start position:0%
it up to five megawatts because uh the
 
02:23:04.969 --> 02:23:04.979 align:start position:0%
industry was telling us that this is you
 
02:23:06.349 --> 02:23:06.359 align:start position:0%
know as I said before three to five
 
02:23:08.030 --> 02:23:08.040 align:start position:0%
megawatts is a sweet spot where the
 
02:23:09.830 --> 02:23:09.840 align:start position:0%
numbers work that's the way the industry
 
02:23:09.840 --> 02:23:13.010 align:start position:0%
numbers work that's the way the industry
works

02:23:13.010 --> 02:23:13.020 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:15.050 --> 02:23:15.060 align:start position:0%
well my follow-up question would be I
 
02:23:17.090 --> 02:23:17.100 align:start position:0%
was reading the contract
 
02:23:20.690 --> 02:23:20.700 align:start position:0%
that Rockingham County has written with
 
02:23:22.670 --> 02:23:22.680 align:start position:0%
revision energy to put in a five
 
02:23:24.469 --> 02:23:24.479 align:start position:0%
megawatt system at the new County
 
02:23:26.570 --> 02:23:26.580 align:start position:0%
Complex that would be built over the
 
02:23:28.010 --> 02:23:28.020 align:start position:0%
next two years
 
02:23:30.170 --> 02:23:30.180 align:start position:0%
and the price tag on that system was 10
 
02:23:32.870 --> 02:23:32.880 align:start position:0%
million dollars which is a significant
 
02:23:34.969 --> 02:23:34.979 align:start position:0%
amount of money
 
02:23:34.979 --> 02:23:37.969 align:start position:0%
amount of money
and

02:23:37.969 --> 02:23:37.979 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:41.330 --> 02:23:41.340 align:start position:0%
I guess my question would be
 
02:23:43.610 --> 02:23:43.620 align:start position:0%
assuming that the County Complex uses
 
02:23:47.690 --> 02:23:47.700 align:start position:0%
most if not all of that five megawatts
 
02:23:47.700 --> 02:23:49.670 align:start position:0%
most if not all of that five megawatts
uh

02:23:49.670 --> 02:23:49.680 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:23:53.809 --> 02:23:53.819 align:start position:0%
how does Net metering help
 
02:23:55.130 --> 02:23:55.140 align:start position:0%
make this
 
02:23:58.550 --> 02:23:58.560 align:start position:0%
project more affordable
 
02:24:00.770 --> 02:24:00.780 align:start position:0%
well thanks for your question and
 
02:24:02.870 --> 02:24:02.880 align:start position:0%
you know I can't speak to the Rockingham
 
02:24:02.880 --> 02:24:03.889 align:start position:0%
you know I can't speak to the Rockingham
project

02:24:03.889 --> 02:24:03.899 align:start position:0%
project
 
02:24:06.410 --> 02:24:06.420 align:start position:0%
uh and I
 
02:24:11.690 --> 02:24:11.700 align:start position:0%
I in a sense think that we you know we
 
02:24:13.550 --> 02:24:13.560 align:start position:0%
make certain things possible through
 
02:24:15.469 --> 02:24:15.479 align:start position:0%
legislation that seem to make sense to
 
02:24:19.190 --> 02:24:19.200 align:start position:0%
us and potentially reduce costs for New
 
02:24:21.170 --> 02:24:21.180 align:start position:0%
Hampshire consumers I mean that's that's
 
02:24:23.270 --> 02:24:23.280 align:start position:0%
what that's what we're all about when it
 
02:24:25.490 --> 02:24:25.500 align:start position:0%
comes to electricity policy in fact it's
 
02:24:27.590 --> 02:24:27.600 align:start position:0%
in statute that's what we should be all
 
02:24:27.600 --> 02:24:28.550 align:start position:0%
in statute that's what we should be all
about

02:24:28.550 --> 02:24:28.560 align:start position:0%
about
 
02:24:30.950 --> 02:24:30.960 align:start position:0%
seems to me that what we do with this
 
02:24:33.910 --> 02:24:33.920 align:start position:0%
legislation is we let municipalities
 
02:24:36.469 --> 02:24:36.479 align:start position:0%
make a business decision
 
02:24:39.349 --> 02:24:39.359 align:start position:0%
if they can't make the numbers work
 
02:24:43.070 --> 02:24:43.080 align:start position:0%
they they don't do it if the if the
 
02:24:43.080 --> 02:24:45.469 align:start position:0%
they they don't do it if the if the
builders

02:24:45.469 --> 02:24:45.479 align:start position:0%
builders
 
02:24:47.030 --> 02:24:47.040 align:start position:0%
look at a project look at Supply
 
02:24:48.830 --> 02:24:48.840 align:start position:0%
channels have cost and say we we just
 
02:24:50.510 --> 02:24:50.520 align:start position:0%
can do it for this cost but we can't do
 
02:24:52.730 --> 02:24:52.740 align:start position:0%
it for that that cost those are business
 
02:24:52.740 --> 02:24:54.050 align:start position:0%
it for that that cost those are business
decisions

02:24:54.050 --> 02:24:54.060 align:start position:0%
decisions
 
02:24:57.950 --> 02:24:57.960 align:start position:0%
I do think the evidence has shown that
 
02:25:00.469 --> 02:25:00.479 align:start position:0%
it's it has been an experience of New
 
02:25:01.670 --> 02:25:01.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and the spouse has done this
 
02:25:04.309 --> 02:25:04.319 align:start position:0%
already that the three to five
 
02:25:07.550 --> 02:25:07.560 align:start position:0%
megawatt is the area which it starts to
 
02:25:11.090 --> 02:25:11.100 align:start position:0%
become cost effective now I'm I'm not in
 
02:25:12.710 --> 02:25:12.720 align:start position:0%
this business we'll hear from others who
 
02:25:15.349 --> 02:25:15.359 align:start position:0%
are are but that seems to be the case
 
02:25:17.990 --> 02:25:18.000 align:start position:0%
and that's why here if we make this
 
02:25:19.849 --> 02:25:19.859 align:start position:0%
technical change that you can put
 
02:25:21.590 --> 02:25:21.600 align:start position:0%
together a group of people that'll help
 
02:25:23.630 --> 02:25:23.640 align:start position:0%
you make those numbers seems to me a
 
02:25:25.550 --> 02:25:25.560 align:start position:0%
pretty good bill
 
02:25:27.530 --> 02:25:27.540 align:start position:0%
okay I guess we can pursue this line of
 
02:25:29.210 --> 02:25:29.220 align:start position:0%
question with questioning with some
 
02:25:30.650 --> 02:25:30.660 align:start position:0%
other folks as well
 
02:25:33.290 --> 02:25:33.300 align:start position:0%
uh representative Reynolds looks like he
 
02:25:35.270 --> 02:25:35.280 align:start position:0%
has a question
 
02:25:37.730 --> 02:25:37.740 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I I'd like to ask
 
02:25:39.950 --> 02:25:39.960 align:start position:0%
a question it's kind of a follow-up to
 
02:25:43.429 --> 02:25:43.439 align:start position:0%
your question if if I may to of Senator
 
02:25:44.929 --> 02:25:44.939 align:start position:0%
Waters isn't it
 
02:25:46.910 --> 02:25:46.920 align:start position:0%
you're understanding
 
02:25:46.920 --> 02:25:48.710 align:start position:0%
you're understanding
uh

02:25:48.710 --> 02:25:48.720 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:25:50.630 --> 02:25:50.640 align:start position:0%
what you just said about three to five
 
02:25:53.210 --> 02:25:53.220 align:start position:0%
megawatts being the the sort of the
 
02:25:54.590 --> 02:25:54.600 align:start position:0%
sweet spot where it becomes cost
 
02:25:57.230 --> 02:25:57.240 align:start position:0%
effective isn't that because a
 
02:25:59.690 --> 02:25:59.700 align:start position:0%
significant part of the cost of any
 
02:26:02.570 --> 02:26:02.580 align:start position:0%
project is actually the interconnection
 
02:26:05.630 --> 02:26:05.640 align:start position:0%
cost of that project to the grid and
 
02:26:08.150 --> 02:26:08.160 align:start position:0%
that's a cost that the that the uh
 
02:26:10.610 --> 02:26:10.620 align:start position:0%
neither the municipality or the builder
 
02:26:13.130 --> 02:26:13.140 align:start position:0%
of the system really controls that's a
 
02:26:15.889 --> 02:26:15.899 align:start position:0%
cost that the you that the utility gives
 
02:26:18.530 --> 02:26:18.540 align:start position:0%
to the developers of the project to
 
02:26:21.110 --> 02:26:21.120 align:start position:0%
interconnect and it's a significant cost
 
02:26:24.770 --> 02:26:24.780 align:start position:0%
is that why the scale matters so much
 
02:26:26.570 --> 02:26:26.580 align:start position:0%
thanks for your question and I'm sure
 
02:26:28.370 --> 02:26:28.380 align:start position:0%
you will hear from
 
02:26:32.389 --> 02:26:32.399 align:start position:0%
the industry folks that this has been a
 
02:26:34.250 --> 02:26:34.260 align:start position:0%
red line and stopped some projects I
 
02:26:36.410 --> 02:26:36.420 align:start position:0%
know very much about one and over that
 
02:26:39.290 --> 02:26:39.300 align:start position:0%
the County Complex wanted to do and if
 
02:26:40.910 --> 02:26:40.920 align:start position:0%
you're that first customer in you're
 
02:26:42.889 --> 02:26:42.899 align:start position:0%
bearing the whole cost you are going to
 
02:26:46.630 --> 02:26:46.640 align:start position:0%
see later a bill from the Senate which
 
02:26:49.910 --> 02:26:49.920 align:start position:0%
attempts to look at that issue because
 
02:26:52.670 --> 02:26:52.680 align:start position:0%
it is an important one I'll just say in
 
02:26:55.210 --> 02:26:55.220 align:start position:0%
reference a number of years ago
 
02:26:57.530 --> 02:26:57.540 align:start position:0%
a colleague in the Republican colleague
 
02:27:00.290 --> 02:27:00.300 align:start position:0%
and the Senate and I put together a bill
 
02:27:02.570 --> 02:27:02.580 align:start position:0%
that was a kind of an analog situation
 
02:27:02.580 --> 02:27:03.650 align:start position:0%
that was a kind of an analog situation
where

02:27:03.650 --> 02:27:03.660 align:start position:0%
where
 
02:27:05.690 --> 02:27:05.700 align:start position:0%
if you were the first person to bring in
 
02:27:06.830 --> 02:27:06.840 align:start position:0%
the infrastructure for a mall
 
02:27:08.809 --> 02:27:08.819 align:start position:0%
development then subsequent people
 
02:27:10.910 --> 02:27:10.920 align:start position:0%
coming into that development you could
 
02:27:12.830 --> 02:27:12.840 align:start position:0%
you could get a portion of your original
 
02:27:14.870 --> 02:27:14.880 align:start position:0%
expense now we passed that and I think
 
02:27:17.210 --> 02:27:17.220 align:start position:0%
it's kind of analogous to hear but
 
02:27:18.830 --> 02:27:18.840 align:start position:0%
you'll see in the subsequent bill from
 
02:27:20.030 --> 02:27:20.040 align:start position:0%
the Senate
 
02:27:21.590 --> 02:27:21.600 align:start position:0%
um a study group that's set up to look
 
02:27:23.330 --> 02:27:23.340 align:start position:0%
at that with the utilities and so on
 
02:27:25.370 --> 02:27:25.380 align:start position:0%
because it is a there's an issue of
 
02:27:26.929 --> 02:27:26.939 align:start position:0%
fairness there I think
 
02:27:33.530 --> 02:27:33.540 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:36.710 --> 02:27:36.720 align:start position:0%
okay additional questions
 
02:27:38.750 --> 02:27:38.760 align:start position:0%
seeing none we thank you Senator Waters
 
02:27:40.010 --> 02:27:40.020 align:start position:0%
we'll let you go so you can get some
 
02:27:43.690 --> 02:27:43.700 align:start position:0%
lunch so you see your lunch after lunch
 
02:27:48.410 --> 02:27:48.420 align:start position:0%
and next we're going to call on The
 
02:27:51.050 --> 02:27:51.060 align:start position:0%
Honorable Lee oxenham from Plainfield
 
02:27:52.849 --> 02:27:52.859 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire to
 
02:27:54.950 --> 02:27:54.960 align:start position:0%
come to talk to us about this bill since
 
02:27:56.630 --> 02:27:56.640 align:start position:0%
she made a long drive from Plainfield
 
02:27:59.450 --> 02:27:59.460 align:start position:0%
and I'm sure she would like to get home
 
02:28:02.510 --> 02:28:02.520 align:start position:0%
um before dark so uh
 
02:28:04.550 --> 02:28:04.560 align:start position:0%
representative oxenham the floor is
 
02:28:04.560 --> 02:28:07.250 align:start position:0%
representative oxenham the floor is
yours

02:28:07.250 --> 02:28:07.260 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:09.950 --> 02:28:09.960 align:start position:0%
former representative occident thank you
 
02:28:12.110 --> 02:28:12.120 align:start position:0%
very much Mr chair delighted to be here
 
02:28:14.050 --> 02:28:14.060 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my testimony
 
02:28:16.730 --> 02:28:16.740 align:start position:0%
many of you will be familiar with the
 
02:28:16.740 --> 02:28:24.710 align:start position:0%
many of you will be familiar with the
map

02:28:24.710 --> 02:28:24.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:27.950 --> 02:28:27.960 align:start position:0%
okay all set
 
02:28:29.570 --> 02:28:29.580 align:start position:0%
many of you will be familiar with the
 
02:28:32.389 --> 02:28:32.399 align:start position:0%
map I just circulated you will recall
 
02:28:35.030 --> 02:28:35.040 align:start position:0%
last spring we had a similar bill and I
 
02:28:37.370 --> 02:28:37.380 align:start position:0%
think that's the the text that you may
 
02:28:38.389 --> 02:28:38.399 align:start position:0%
have been referring to about
 
02:28:40.429 --> 02:28:40.439 align:start position:0%
quasi-public entities and peas
 
02:28:42.590 --> 02:28:42.600 align:start position:0%
Development Authority this is a clean
 
02:28:47.030 --> 02:28:47.040 align:start position:0%
bill it doesn't have those um issues
 
02:28:51.410 --> 02:28:51.420 align:start position:0%
which raise controversy last year as our
 
02:28:53.750 --> 02:28:53.760 align:start position:0%
chair will recall we we're down to the
 
02:28:56.330 --> 02:28:56.340 align:start position:0%
wire we were looking at an amendment on
 
02:29:00.889 --> 02:29:00.899 align:start position:0%
the bill and there was a a consensus of
 
02:29:02.870 --> 02:29:02.880 align:start position:0%
the committee a bipartisan consensus
 
02:29:04.429 --> 02:29:04.439 align:start position:0%
that we liked this bill we thought it
 
02:29:06.889 --> 02:29:06.899 align:start position:0%
was appropriate to allow municipalities
 
02:29:09.290 --> 02:29:09.300 align:start position:0%
to work together when they don't have
 
02:29:11.990 --> 02:29:12.000 align:start position:0%
sufficient load on their own
 
02:29:14.929 --> 02:29:14.939 align:start position:0%
uh but that those those that particular
 
02:29:17.690 --> 02:29:17.700 align:start position:0%
language created issues so uh our chair
 
02:29:20.750 --> 02:29:20.760 align:start position:0%
said that if no other sponsor came
 
02:29:22.610 --> 02:29:22.620 align:start position:0%
forward he would submit this bill
 
02:29:26.510 --> 02:29:26.520 align:start position:0%
himself as a clean bill which only has
 
02:29:28.250 --> 02:29:28.260 align:start position:0%
the language that we have before us
 
02:29:30.410 --> 02:29:30.420 align:start position:0%
today so I hope that we can return to
 
02:29:32.570 --> 02:29:32.580 align:start position:0%
that lovely morning in May when we were
 
02:29:34.910 --> 02:29:34.920 align:start position:0%
all agreeing on the importance of this
 
02:29:37.570 --> 02:29:37.580 align:start position:0%
text and we can move this bill forward
 
02:29:42.050 --> 02:29:42.060 align:start position:0%
the importance of the map the yellow is
 
02:29:45.349 --> 02:29:45.359 align:start position:0%
Liberty the blue is eversource and the
 
02:29:47.630 --> 02:29:47.640 align:start position:0%
pink is the co-op there's a little
 
02:29:49.929 --> 02:29:49.939 align:start position:0%
yellow island in the center of the map
 
02:29:52.849 --> 02:29:52.859 align:start position:0%
and that is the small amount of Liberty
 
02:29:55.849 --> 02:29:55.859 align:start position:0%
territory that is in Cornish that's the
 
02:29:58.790 --> 02:29:58.800 align:start position:0%
area where we are hoping to put an array
 
02:30:02.090 --> 02:30:02.100 align:start position:0%
the Two Towns working together as you
 
02:30:04.190 --> 02:30:04.200 align:start position:0%
can tell it's impossible for for for
 
02:30:06.889 --> 02:30:06.899 align:start position:0%
this bill for for the entity to be
 
02:30:09.469 --> 02:30:09.479 align:start position:0%
sustainable in the municipality of
 
02:30:12.170 --> 02:30:12.180 align:start position:0%
Cornish the the large territory that
 
02:30:14.809 --> 02:30:14.819 align:start position:0%
could sustain this array is in
 
02:30:18.170 --> 02:30:18.180 align:start position:0%
Plainfield in Lebanon and in Enfield
 
02:30:20.929 --> 02:30:20.939 align:start position:0%
so um I I bring this to your attention
 
02:30:23.929 --> 02:30:23.939 align:start position:0%
strictly as an illustration many of our
 
02:30:25.849 --> 02:30:25.859 align:start position:0%
small towns across the state are in the
 
02:30:27.290 --> 02:30:27.300 align:start position:0%
same place they have multiple
 
02:30:30.410 --> 02:30:30.420 align:start position:0%
territories we all understand you have
 
02:30:32.870 --> 02:30:32.880 align:start position:0%
to keep these group post Arrangements
 
02:30:35.990 --> 02:30:36.000 align:start position:0%
within the territory of the utility but
 
02:30:39.290 --> 02:30:39.300 align:start position:0%
there is the putting superimposing the
 
02:30:42.410 --> 02:30:42.420 align:start position:0%
municipal boundary just creates an
 
02:30:44.990 --> 02:30:45.000 align:start position:0%
obstacle a constraint which has meant
 
02:30:47.570 --> 02:30:47.580 align:start position:0%
that only 10 towns in the state have
 
02:30:49.610 --> 02:30:49.620 align:start position:0%
been able to move forward and the rest
 
02:30:53.270 --> 02:30:53.280 align:start position:0%
of us have been left unable to proceed
 
02:30:56.870 --> 02:30:56.880 align:start position:0%
with cost-effective solutions to our
 
02:31:00.290 --> 02:31:00.300 align:start position:0%
issues of high electricity costs and
 
02:31:04.610 --> 02:31:04.620 align:start position:0%
lack of diversity uh in our supply the
 
02:31:06.530 --> 02:31:06.540 align:start position:0%
the only other issue I wanted to bring
 
02:31:09.110 --> 02:31:09.120 align:start position:0%
forward for your attention today was
 
02:31:11.389 --> 02:31:11.399 align:start position:0%
that once again in the fiscal note we
 
02:31:13.070 --> 02:31:13.080 align:start position:0%
have the issue of potential cost
 
02:31:15.410 --> 02:31:15.420 align:start position:0%
shifting I had hoped we had laid this
 
02:31:17.929 --> 02:31:17.939 align:start position:0%
one to rest we had the vder study that
 
02:31:20.150 --> 02:31:20.160 align:start position:0%
came came out last year after years of
 
02:31:21.950 --> 02:31:21.960 align:start position:0%
oh let's not make any decisions on that
 
02:31:24.410 --> 02:31:24.420 align:start position:0%
one let's wait until the vdr study comes
 
02:31:28.429 --> 02:31:28.439 align:start position:0%
out we have the vder study there is no
 
02:31:30.710 --> 02:31:30.720 align:start position:0%
significant cost shifting let's take
 
02:31:35.270 --> 02:31:35.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:37.730 --> 02:31:37.740 align:start position:0%
and I will also just bring your
 
02:31:39.710 --> 02:31:39.720 align:start position:0%
attention in the dunski study that it
 
02:31:42.170 --> 02:31:42.180 align:start position:0%
mentioned there are numerous additional
 
02:31:45.290 --> 02:31:45.300 align:start position:0%
benefits which are not costed in so when
 
02:31:46.969 --> 02:31:46.979 align:start position:0%
they say there's no significant cost
 
02:31:46.979 --> 02:31:48.290 align:start position:0%
they say there's no significant cost
shifting

02:31:48.290 --> 02:31:48.300 align:start position:0%
shifting
 
02:31:51.590 --> 02:31:51.600 align:start position:0%
that take doesn't even begin to go to
 
02:31:53.809 --> 02:31:53.819 align:start position:0%
the additional benefits with more
 
02:31:55.910 --> 02:31:55.920 align:start position:0%
renewable energy in less criteria
 
02:31:59.150 --> 02:31:59.160 align:start position:0%
pollutants less greenhouse gases reduced
 
02:32:02.590 --> 02:32:02.600 align:start position:0%
load reduced Peaks increased Health
 
02:32:05.270 --> 02:32:05.280 align:start position:0%
lower hospitalizations for children
 
02:32:07.969 --> 02:32:07.979 align:start position:0%
across the state we all know renewable
 
02:32:10.510 --> 02:32:10.520 align:start position:0%
energy is coming the clean energy
 
02:32:13.730 --> 02:32:13.740 align:start position:0%
Revolution is moving forward in all the
 
02:32:15.889 --> 02:32:15.899 align:start position:0%
states around us it's time for New
 
02:32:17.809 --> 02:32:17.819 align:start position:0%
Hampshire not to be the laggard this is
 
02:32:20.570 --> 02:32:20.580 align:start position:0%
a good bill please support it it was
 
02:32:23.030 --> 02:32:23.040 align:start position:0%
supported last year we had a problem
 
02:32:25.190 --> 02:32:25.200 align:start position:0%
with some anomalous language that's gone
 
02:32:27.770 --> 02:32:27.780 align:start position:0%
it's a clean bill please move ahead with
 
02:32:29.809 --> 02:32:29.819 align:start position:0%
it thank you
 
02:32:33.830 --> 02:32:33.840 align:start position:0%
thank you questions for The Honorable MS
 
02:32:33.840 --> 02:32:36.170 align:start position:0%
thank you questions for The Honorable MS
oxenham

02:32:36.170 --> 02:32:36.180 align:start position:0%
oxenham
 
02:32:38.090 --> 02:32:38.100 align:start position:0%
representative McGee has a question
 
02:32:40.370 --> 02:32:40.380 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and nice to see
 
02:32:43.070 --> 02:32:43.080 align:start position:0%
you again representative oxenham
 
02:32:45.770 --> 02:32:45.780 align:start position:0%
um Okay so
 
02:32:48.650 --> 02:32:48.660 align:start position:0%
uh as was mentioned with the opening
 
02:32:51.050 --> 02:32:51.060 align:start position:0%
speaker with Senator Waters there were
 
02:32:52.730 --> 02:32:52.740 align:start position:0%
two bills that were really sister or
 
02:32:54.770 --> 02:32:54.780 align:start position:0%
companion bills one on the house side
 
02:32:56.030 --> 02:32:56.040 align:start position:0%
and one on the other side of the wall
 
02:32:58.550 --> 02:32:58.560 align:start position:0%
this is the other side of the wall
 
02:33:00.710 --> 02:33:00.720 align:start position:0%
um and and the bill that we submitted
 
02:33:00.720 --> 02:33:01.490 align:start position:0%
um and and the bill that we submitted
um

02:33:01.490 --> 02:33:01.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:33:03.710 --> 02:33:03.720 align:start position:0%
did have the problematic language still
 
02:33:06.530 --> 02:33:06.540 align:start position:0%
in it but it also passed so it did
 
02:33:08.150 --> 02:33:08.160 align:start position:0%
receive enough support to get through
 
02:33:11.090 --> 02:33:11.100 align:start position:0%
the house so I guess
 
02:33:13.309 --> 02:33:13.319 align:start position:0%
um my question was
 
02:33:13.319 --> 02:33:15.290 align:start position:0%
um my question was
um

02:33:15.290 --> 02:33:15.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:33:17.210 --> 02:33:17.220 align:start position:0%
well it sounds like you would support
 
02:33:18.650 --> 02:33:18.660 align:start position:0%
either Bill if they could make it
 
02:33:20.150 --> 02:33:20.160 align:start position:0%
through to the governor's desk right
 
02:33:24.290 --> 02:33:24.300 align:start position:0%
you're absolutely correct okay but uh I
 
02:33:25.969 --> 02:33:25.979 align:start position:0%
understand and I just want to clarify I
 
02:33:27.950 --> 02:33:27.960 align:start position:0%
think you're correct that perhaps this
 
02:33:31.910 --> 02:33:31.920 align:start position:0%
language is cleaner for us to consider
 
02:33:34.670 --> 02:33:34.680 align:start position:0%
moving forward with because usually only
 
02:33:37.030 --> 02:33:37.040 align:start position:0%
one of the bills actually
 
02:33:40.610 --> 02:33:40.620 align:start position:0%
goes all the way through and so would it
 
02:33:44.630 --> 02:33:44.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:47.270 --> 02:33:47.280 align:start position:0%
oh uh
 
02:33:49.849 --> 02:33:49.859 align:start position:0%
I I guess I would say so I I think that
 
02:33:51.110 --> 02:33:51.120 align:start position:0%
can be left to a committee of conference
 
02:33:53.750 --> 02:33:53.760 align:start position:0%
I don't think that's a that's good it's
 
02:33:55.849 --> 02:33:55.859 align:start position:0%
not a showstopper the bill needs to move
 
02:33:58.790 --> 02:33:58.800 align:start position:0%
forward and if both go forward yeah well
 
02:34:03.490 --> 02:34:03.500 align:start position:0%
that's uh up benefit of riches
 
02:34:08.809 --> 02:34:08.819 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:11.030 --> 02:34:11.040 align:start position:0%
seeing none we want to thank you for
 
02:34:12.710 --> 02:34:12.720 align:start position:0%
making the long drive from Plainfield
 
02:34:14.809 --> 02:34:14.819 align:start position:0%
and it was nice to see you again thank
 
02:34:16.610 --> 02:34:16.620 align:start position:0%

02:34:19.190 --> 02:34:19.200 align:start position:0%
thank you for your work next I'll call

02:34:35.750 --> 02:34:35.760 align:start position:0%

02:34:47.809 --> 02:34:47.819 align:start position:0%
energy is opposed to Senate Bill 68 FN
 
02:34:50.630 --> 02:34:50.640 align:start position:0%
is introduced as I believe everybody is
 
02:34:52.610 --> 02:34:52.620 align:start position:0%
well aware now uh State Statute
 
02:34:55.670 --> 02:34:55.680 align:start position:0%
currently permits a municipal host uh
 
02:34:58.610 --> 02:34:58.620 align:start position:0%
with a total Peak generating capacity of
 
02:35:00.710 --> 02:35:00.720 align:start position:0%
greater than one megawatt less than five
 
02:35:03.590 --> 02:35:03.600 align:start position:0%
to serve as a group host to offset the
 
02:35:05.330 --> 02:35:05.340 align:start position:0%
electricity requirements of a group of
 
02:35:07.730 --> 02:35:07.740 align:start position:0%
members that consist exclusively of
 
02:35:10.010 --> 02:35:10.020 align:start position:0%
political subdivisions and these
 
02:35:12.050 --> 02:35:12.060 align:start position:0%
Municipal hosts can be publicly or
 
02:35:14.090 --> 02:35:14.100 align:start position:0%
privately owned
 
02:35:15.950 --> 02:35:15.960 align:start position:0%
um as has been mentioned the statute was
 
02:35:18.349 --> 02:35:18.359 align:start position:0%
originally created under house bill 315
 
02:35:21.770 --> 02:35:21.780 align:start position:0%
from 2021 and modified further by House
 
02:35:24.410 --> 02:35:24.420 align:start position:0%
Bill 1258 last year to include the state
 
02:35:25.910 --> 02:35:25.920 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire as a political
 
02:35:25.920 --> 02:35:27.469 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire as a political
subdivision

02:35:27.469 --> 02:35:27.479 align:start position:0%
subdivision
 
02:35:31.070 --> 02:35:31.080 align:start position:0%
um the bills really only change is on
 
02:35:33.110 --> 02:35:33.120 align:start position:0%
line six to eight um removing the
 
02:35:34.910 --> 02:35:34.920 align:start position:0%
statutory language that requires a
 
02:35:36.590 --> 02:35:36.600 align:start position:0%
municipal host must be located in the
 
02:35:39.230 --> 02:35:39.240 align:start position:0%
same municipality is all political
 
02:35:41.450 --> 02:35:41.460 align:start position:0%
subdivisions or group members if the
 
02:35:43.849 --> 02:35:43.859 align:start position:0%
facility began operation after January 1
 
02:35:45.770 --> 02:35:45.780 align:start position:0%
of 2021.
 
02:35:47.389 --> 02:35:47.399 align:start position:0%
um this change would allow for newly
 
02:35:48.830 --> 02:35:48.840 align:start position:0%
constructed generation serving as a
 
02:35:50.090 --> 02:35:50.100 align:start position:0%
municipal host to have group members
 
02:35:53.030 --> 02:35:53.040 align:start position:0%
outside of the same municipality that
 
02:35:54.830 --> 02:35:54.840 align:start position:0%
the host is located in obviously
 
02:35:56.690 --> 02:35:56.700 align:start position:0%
providing that they're all within the
 
02:35:58.849 --> 02:35:58.859 align:start position:0%
same franchise territory
 
02:36:00.650 --> 02:36:00.660 align:start position:0%
um much like our testimony on House Bill
 
02:36:02.389 --> 02:36:02.399 align:start position:0%
139 when it was before this committee
 
02:36:04.370 --> 02:36:04.380 align:start position:0%
the department opposes any changes to
 
02:36:06.410 --> 02:36:06.420 align:start position:0%
States net metering statute at this time
 
02:36:10.030 --> 02:36:10.040 align:start position:0%
there is an ongoing docket de
 
02:36:13.309 --> 02:36:13.319 align:start position:0%
22060 that is pending before the Public
 
02:36:14.750 --> 02:36:14.760 align:start position:0%
Utilities Commission that will consider
 
02:36:16.790 --> 02:36:16.800 align:start position:0%
changes to the current net metering
 
02:36:18.950 --> 02:36:18.960 align:start position:0%
tariff structure including compensation
 
02:36:21.050 --> 02:36:21.060 align:start position:0%
to customer generators and it will also
 
02:36:23.389 --> 02:36:23.399 align:start position:0%
take into account the outcome of the
 
02:36:25.370 --> 02:36:25.380 align:start position:0%
vder study and determine to what extent
 
02:36:27.590 --> 02:36:27.600 align:start position:0%
cost shifting is occurring
 
02:36:29.990 --> 02:36:30.000 align:start position:0%
um again doe much like we have on many
 
02:36:32.630 --> 02:36:32.640 align:start position:0%
of the other net metering bills suggests
 
02:36:35.030 --> 02:36:35.040 align:start position:0%
letting suggest to policy makers to let
 
02:36:36.889 --> 02:36:36.899 align:start position:0%
the puc process play out before making
 
02:36:38.750 --> 02:36:38.760 align:start position:0%
any changes to the state's net metering
 
02:36:41.570 --> 02:36:41.580 align:start position:0%
statute and for further context s has
 
02:36:43.490 --> 02:36:43.500 align:start position:0%
been mentioned there are 10 currently
 
02:36:45.349 --> 02:36:45.359 align:start position:0%
registered Municipal hosts in the state
 
02:36:47.450 --> 02:36:47.460 align:start position:0%
they are located in Manchester Milton
 
02:36:49.990 --> 02:36:50.000 align:start position:0%
Berlin Gorham Hillsborough Canaan
 
02:36:53.750 --> 02:36:53.760 align:start position:0%
bosquin Hooksett Penacook in Durham
 
02:36:55.550 --> 02:36:55.560 align:start position:0%
um and that concludes my testimony happy
 
02:36:56.990 --> 02:36:57.000 align:start position:0%
to take any questions
 
02:36:59.870 --> 02:36:59.880 align:start position:0%
thank you questions for Mr Roberge
 
02:37:01.730 --> 02:37:01.740 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas has a question
 
02:37:03.770 --> 02:37:03.780 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for the big
 
02:37:03.780 --> 02:37:04.610 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for the big
question

02:37:04.610 --> 02:37:04.620 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:37:07.070 --> 02:37:07.080 align:start position:0%
and I guess we will ask us that every as
 
02:37:09.349 --> 02:37:09.359 align:start position:0%
every Bill comes by here
 
02:37:11.290 --> 02:37:11.300 align:start position:0%
when will that docket be completed
 
02:37:13.429 --> 02:37:13.439 align:start position:0%
that's fair
 
02:37:15.469 --> 02:37:15.479 align:start position:0%
um I believe that there have been I'm
 
02:37:17.630 --> 02:37:17.640 align:start position:0%
trying to recall off the top of my head
 
02:37:18.889 --> 02:37:18.899 align:start position:0%
I can certainly follow up with more
 
02:37:20.630 --> 02:37:20.640 align:start position:0%
specific information but I believe there
 
02:37:23.090 --> 02:37:23.100 align:start position:0%
will be likely significant progress by
 
02:37:25.910 --> 02:37:25.920 align:start position:0%
around this time next year but I'd have
 
02:37:27.650 --> 02:37:27.660 align:start position:0%
to take a further look I don't want to
 
02:37:29.630 --> 02:37:29.640 align:start position:0%
speak out of term I can follow up with
 
02:37:34.010 --> 02:37:34.020 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:35.929 --> 02:37:35.939 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee
 
02:37:37.910 --> 02:37:37.920 align:start position:0%
representative McGee has one thank you
 
02:37:40.910 --> 02:37:40.920 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman thank you Mr robesch
 
02:37:43.849 --> 02:37:43.859 align:start position:0%
um my question is around the the
 
02:37:46.550 --> 02:37:46.560 align:start position:0%
opposition to there being an expansion
 
02:37:48.230 --> 02:37:48.240 align:start position:0%
of these types of projects and whether
 
02:37:51.410 --> 02:37:51.420 align:start position:0%
it comes from an energy standpoint or
 
02:37:53.090 --> 02:37:53.100 align:start position:0%
from an economic standpoint because I
 
02:37:55.790 --> 02:37:55.800 align:start position:0%
know the most recent 10-year strategy
 
02:37:57.950 --> 02:37:57.960 align:start position:0%
report that you guys put out you know
 
02:38:01.070 --> 02:38:01.080 align:start position:0%
the number one bullet was was um you
 
02:38:04.429 --> 02:38:04.439 align:start position:0%
know costs sure and so I think a lot of
 
02:38:07.070 --> 02:38:07.080 align:start position:0%
people are pursuing these projects in
 
02:38:09.410 --> 02:38:09.420 align:start position:0%
order to lower costs for municipalities
 
02:38:11.510 --> 02:38:11.520 align:start position:0%
and so I'm just wondering why the
 
02:38:13.309 --> 02:38:13.319 align:start position:0%
opposition would be focused on trying to
 
02:38:15.469 --> 02:38:15.479 align:start position:0%
limit our ability to to
 
02:38:18.410 --> 02:38:18.420 align:start position:0%
uh you know extend people the ability to
 
02:38:20.330 --> 02:38:20.340 align:start position:0%
do these projects no for that purpose
 
02:38:22.849 --> 02:38:22.859 align:start position:0%
and I thank you for that question so I
 
02:38:25.070 --> 02:38:25.080 align:start position:0%
think I don't really think it's well I
 
02:38:26.990 --> 02:38:27.000 align:start position:0%
think there's an economic aspect to it
 
02:38:29.450 --> 02:38:29.460 align:start position:0%
but I think it's more of a procedural
 
02:38:31.070 --> 02:38:31.080 align:start position:0%
opposition is that there's a current
 
02:38:32.809 --> 02:38:32.819 align:start position:0%
adjudicative proceeding at the Public
 
02:38:34.670 --> 02:38:34.680 align:start position:0%
Utilities Commission which will look at
 
02:38:36.770 --> 02:38:36.780 align:start position:0%
this issue very in-depth Department of
 
02:38:38.330 --> 02:38:38.340 align:start position:0%
energy is also a party to that as well
 
02:38:40.309 --> 02:38:40.319 align:start position:0%
as many other stakeholders groups I'm
 
02:38:42.590 --> 02:38:42.600 align:start position:0%
sure many of them are in this room
 
02:38:47.030 --> 02:38:47.040 align:start position:0%
um you know the puc is designed as a
 
02:38:49.309 --> 02:38:49.319 align:start position:0%
forum by which all of these parties can
 
02:38:51.469 --> 02:38:51.479 align:start position:0%
fully adjudicate these issues and they
 
02:38:53.690 --> 02:38:53.700 align:start position:0%
are Technical and very complex and
 
02:38:56.510 --> 02:38:56.520 align:start position:0%
address these issues in a in a forum
 
02:38:58.070 --> 02:38:58.080 align:start position:0%
um again through the Judiciary
 
02:38:59.630 --> 02:38:59.640 align:start position:0%
proceeding I think we'd prefer to let
 
02:39:02.110 --> 02:39:02.120 align:start position:0%
that process play out before making any
 
02:39:04.849 --> 02:39:04.859 align:start position:0%
uh real changes to the state's net
 
02:39:07.610 --> 02:39:07.620 align:start position:0%
metering statute while that proceeding
 
02:39:10.610 --> 02:39:10.620 align:start position:0%
is ongoing and obviously the vder study
 
02:39:13.730 --> 02:39:13.740 align:start position:0%
uh came out late last year you know I
 
02:39:15.170 --> 02:39:15.180 align:start position:0%
know that there's been some discussion
 
02:39:17.030 --> 02:39:17.040 align:start position:0%
about about whether or not
 
02:39:18.469 --> 02:39:18.479 align:start position:0%
um that should be the end of it that the
 
02:39:20.210 --> 02:39:20.220 align:start position:0%
vdr answered it that there's no cost
 
02:39:20.220 --> 02:39:21.170 align:start position:0%
vdr answered it that there's no cost
shift

02:39:21.170 --> 02:39:21.180 align:start position:0%
shift
 
02:39:23.870 --> 02:39:23.880 align:start position:0%
I think the department views the the the
 
02:39:28.190 --> 02:39:28.200 align:start position:0%
the vder study as a piece of the puzzle
 
02:39:30.230 --> 02:39:30.240 align:start position:0%
that the puc is ultimately putting
 
02:39:32.690 --> 02:39:32.700 align:start position:0%
together they are going to arrive at
 
02:39:34.670 --> 02:39:34.680 align:start position:0%
potential changes to the St uh to the
 
02:39:36.410 --> 02:39:36.420 align:start position:0%
net metering tariff structure look
 
02:39:39.650 --> 02:39:39.660 align:start position:0%
further into uh the impacts that
 
02:39:41.929 --> 02:39:41.939 align:start position:0%
um cost shifting may may have
 
02:39:43.429 --> 02:39:43.439 align:start position:0%
um across different
 
02:39:43.439 --> 02:39:44.809 align:start position:0%
um across different
um customers

02:39:44.809 --> 02:39:44.819 align:start position:0%
um customers
 
02:39:45.830 --> 02:39:45.840 align:start position:0%
um the other thing I just want to know
 
02:39:48.349 --> 02:39:48.359 align:start position:0%
is that you know I know p i I will admit
 
02:39:50.750 --> 02:39:50.760 align:start position:0%
the vder study did not find significant
 
02:39:52.429 --> 02:39:52.439 align:start position:0%
levels of cautious but there was a one
 
02:39:54.469 --> 02:39:54.479 align:start position:0%
percent cost shift uh that they
 
02:39:54.479 --> 02:39:55.910 align:start position:0%
percent cost shift uh that they
identified

02:39:55.910 --> 02:39:55.920 align:start position:0%
identified
 
02:39:57.710 --> 02:39:57.720 align:start position:0%
um and again the puc will consider that
 
02:39:59.210 --> 02:39:59.220 align:start position:0%
in its adjudicated proceeding and
 
02:40:00.410 --> 02:40:00.420 align:start position:0%
overall the department would prefer
 
02:40:01.910 --> 02:40:01.920 align:start position:0%
letting that process play out before
 
02:40:07.309 --> 02:40:07.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:10.849 --> 02:40:10.859 align:start position:0%
okay uh representative Corman has a
 
02:40:12.770 --> 02:40:12.780 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
02:40:16.070 --> 02:40:16.080 align:start position:0%
Mr Roberts once again so you said that
 
02:40:19.429 --> 02:40:19.439 align:start position:0%
we're looking at the puc docket going on
 
02:40:23.090 --> 02:40:23.100 align:start position:0%
for about another year
 
02:40:25.550 --> 02:40:25.560 align:start position:0%
and and I assume it's already been in
 
02:40:28.910 --> 02:40:28.920 align:start position:0%
process for a while it's I should I mean
 
02:40:30.590 --> 02:40:30.600 align:start position:0%
to interrupt I'm sorry I thought there'd
 
02:40:31.849 --> 02:40:31.859 align:start position:0%
be another question after I want to cut
 
02:40:33.889 --> 02:40:33.899 align:start position:0%
you off okay I'm sorry well I'm just
 
02:40:36.889 --> 02:40:36.899 align:start position:0%
wondering uh it seems like this is
 
02:40:40.849 --> 02:40:40.859 align:start position:0%
taking a long time and given that the
 
02:40:44.230 --> 02:40:44.240 align:start position:0%
legislature gets to set policy
 
02:40:46.790 --> 02:40:46.800 align:start position:0%
I'm just wondering why should we be
 
02:40:49.610 --> 02:40:49.620 align:start position:0%
waiting for the puc to take so long when
 
02:40:50.809 --> 02:40:50.819 align:start position:0%
we can actually
 
02:40:54.230 --> 02:40:54.240 align:start position:0%
decide to do this on our own and and
 
02:40:55.969 --> 02:40:55.979 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question so I will
 
02:40:57.849 --> 02:40:57.859 align:start position:0%
obviously concede as I have in the past
 
02:41:00.590 --> 02:41:00.600 align:start position:0%
you folks here are the policy makers you
 
02:41:02.210 --> 02:41:02.220 align:start position:0%
can determine
 
02:41:04.190 --> 02:41:04.200 align:start position:0%
um the policy as you see fit um
 
02:41:06.770 --> 02:41:06.780 align:start position:0%
obviously the department was created a
 
02:41:08.870 --> 02:41:08.880 align:start position:0%
couple years ago to provide a unified
 
02:41:10.969 --> 02:41:10.979 align:start position:0%
policy direction to policy makers to the
 
02:41:14.030 --> 02:41:14.040 align:start position:0%
extent uh policy makers want to go a
 
02:41:15.349 --> 02:41:15.359 align:start position:0%
different route that's obviously their
 
02:41:15.359 --> 02:41:16.969 align:start position:0%
different route that's obviously their
jurisdiction

02:41:16.969 --> 02:41:16.979 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction
 
02:41:22.070 --> 02:41:22.080 align:start position:0%
um regarding the the docket 22060 it's
 
02:41:23.809 --> 02:41:23.819 align:start position:0%
my understanding that that was that was
 
02:41:26.389 --> 02:41:26.399 align:start position:0%
a me that was opened late last year with
 
02:41:27.710 --> 02:41:27.720 align:start position:0%
an order from the Public Utilities
 
02:41:29.030 --> 02:41:29.040 align:start position:0%
Commission I believe that there's been
 
02:41:31.910 --> 02:41:31.920 align:start position:0%
some ongoing discussion as to hearing
 
02:41:34.070 --> 02:41:34.080 align:start position:0%
schedules and that type of thing but
 
02:41:36.469 --> 02:41:36.479 align:start position:0%
that obviously will be a little bit of
 
02:41:38.929 --> 02:41:38.939 align:start position:0%
of a process again this is not something
 
02:41:38.939 --> 02:41:40.070 align:start position:0%
of a process again this is not something
that's

02:41:40.070 --> 02:41:40.080 align:start position:0%
that's
 
02:41:42.530 --> 02:41:42.540 align:start position:0%
these aren't easy matters to to address
 
02:41:44.450 --> 02:41:44.460 align:start position:0%
I mean they're very technical very
 
02:41:46.790 --> 02:41:46.800 align:start position:0%
complex very overwhelming so you know
 
02:41:49.130 --> 02:41:49.140 align:start position:0%
the puc is designed for this
 
02:41:50.750 --> 02:41:50.760 align:start position:0%
um they undertake adjudicative
 
02:41:52.809 --> 02:41:52.819 align:start position:0%
proceedings to fully vet these issues
 
02:41:54.889 --> 02:41:54.899 align:start position:0%
stakeholders to the extent that they're
 
02:41:56.630 --> 02:41:56.640 align:start position:0%
comfortable can take part as interveners
 
02:41:58.250 --> 02:41:58.260 align:start position:0%
in all of these cases and I think the
 
02:41:59.510 --> 02:41:59.520 align:start position:0%
department would just submit laying that
 
02:42:01.070 --> 02:42:01.080 align:start position:0%
process play out before making any
 
02:42:03.730 --> 02:42:03.740 align:start position:0%
substantial policy changes
 
02:42:06.349 --> 02:42:06.359 align:start position:0%
okay thank you seeing no further
 
02:42:09.469 --> 02:42:09.479 align:start position:0%
questions for Mr robarge thank you
 
02:42:12.950 --> 02:42:12.960 align:start position:0%
I'm going to suspend the public hearing
 
02:42:17.210 --> 02:42:17.220 align:start position:0%
on Center Bill 68 and I'm going to
 
02:42:20.630 --> 02:42:20.640 align:start position:0%
open the public hearing as a courtesy to
 
02:42:22.670 --> 02:42:22.680 align:start position:0%
our Senate colleagues I'm going to open
 
02:42:25.910 --> 02:42:25.920 align:start position:0%
the public hearing to Senate Bill 69 and
 
02:42:29.210 --> 02:42:29.220 align:start position:0%
ask Senator Waters to introduce the
 
02:42:29.220 --> 02:42:31.370 align:start position:0%
ask Senator Waters to introduce the
legislation

02:42:31.370 --> 02:42:31.380 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
02:42:34.010 --> 02:42:34.020 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I truly appreciate
 
02:42:36.770 --> 02:42:36.780 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to come in now Senator
 
02:42:38.450 --> 02:42:38.460 align:start position:0%
Waters District before introducing
 
02:42:42.530 --> 02:42:42.540 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 69 on behalf of Senator Avon
 
02:42:43.670 --> 02:42:43.680 align:start position:0%
and I guess it's turning into net
 
02:42:47.929 --> 02:42:47.939 align:start position:0%
metering morning and house Ste and uh I
 
02:42:49.490 --> 02:42:49.500 align:start position:0%
think we certainly are going to need to
 
02:42:51.530 --> 02:42:51.540 align:start position:0%
have some ongoing conversations about
 
02:42:53.570 --> 02:42:53.580 align:start position:0%
what we do about both House and Senate
 
02:42:55.490 --> 02:42:55.500 align:start position:0%
bills on these matters
 
02:42:57.710 --> 02:42:57.720 align:start position:0%
um what this does
 
02:43:00.650 --> 02:43:00.660 align:start position:0%
um and you will see it uh changes the
 
02:43:03.530 --> 02:43:03.540 align:start position:0%
definition of customer
 
02:43:06.349 --> 02:43:06.359 align:start position:0%
um generator uh online seven and eight
 
02:43:09.050 --> 02:43:09.060 align:start position:0%
except is provided for a non-profit host
 
02:43:12.050 --> 02:43:12.060 align:start position:0%
as defined in paragraph 2G what are
 
02:43:13.730 --> 02:43:13.740 align:start position:0%
non-profit hosts going to be well
 
02:43:17.510 --> 02:43:17.520 align:start position:0%
paragraph 2G non-profit host means a
 
02:43:18.830 --> 02:43:18.840 align:start position:0%
customer generator a total Peak
 
02:43:21.889 --> 02:43:21.899 align:start position:0%
generated in capacity so
 
02:43:25.429 --> 02:43:25.439 align:start position:0%
um you know non-profit folks located in
 
02:43:28.429 --> 02:43:28.439 align:start position:0%
the same utility franchise service
 
02:43:30.710 --> 02:43:30.720 align:start position:0%
Terrace territory so you can't be a
 
02:43:32.150 --> 02:43:32.160 align:start position:0%
non-profit in one part of New Hampshire
 
02:43:34.849 --> 02:43:34.859 align:start position:0%
and then go into a different utility
 
02:43:36.349 --> 02:43:36.359 align:start position:0%
service or out of state or something
 
02:43:39.710 --> 02:43:39.720 align:start position:0%
it's uh that's an important definition
 
02:43:39.720 --> 02:43:40.330 align:start position:0%
it's uh that's an important definition
um

02:43:40.330 --> 02:43:40.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:43:43.250 --> 02:43:43.260 align:start position:0%
there and um
 
02:43:47.929 --> 02:43:47.939 align:start position:0%
the non-profit entities included are
 
02:43:52.070 --> 02:43:52.080 align:start position:0%
listed uh there as as well
 
02:43:52.080 --> 02:43:52.790 align:start position:0%
listed uh there as as well
um

02:43:52.790 --> 02:43:52.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:43:58.190 --> 02:43:58.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:00.050 --> 02:44:00.060 align:start position:0%
we have Technical College College
 
02:44:02.809 --> 02:44:02.819 align:start position:0%
University Hospitals as defined in RSA
 
02:44:06.170 --> 02:44:06.180 align:start position:0%
151 colon 2 which is why I always
 
02:44:07.670 --> 02:44:07.680 align:start position:0%
thinking hospitals earlier sorry about
 
02:44:07.680 --> 02:44:08.990 align:start position:0%
thinking hospitals earlier sorry about
that

02:44:08.990 --> 02:44:09.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:44:10.490 --> 02:44:10.500 align:start position:0%
um and then
 
02:44:11.889 --> 02:44:11.899 align:start position:0%
um done
 
02:44:15.110 --> 02:44:15.120 align:start position:0%
uh housing authorities bona fide
 
02:44:16.849 --> 02:44:16.859 align:start position:0%
religious organizations and the peace
 
02:44:18.290 --> 02:44:18.300 align:start position:0%
Development Authority
 
02:44:21.770 --> 02:44:21.780 align:start position:0%
so that is what it it would do
 
02:44:23.330 --> 02:44:23.340 align:start position:0%
um it seems that
 
02:44:25.130 --> 02:44:25.140 align:start position:0%
look at each of those entities being
 
02:44:28.070 --> 02:44:28.080 align:start position:0%
able to take advantage of uh this
 
02:44:31.490 --> 02:44:31.500 align:start position:0%
program would save money for our
 
02:44:33.830 --> 02:44:33.840 align:start position:0%
communities because these are
 
02:44:35.690 --> 02:44:35.700 align:start position:0%
non-profits that are serving our
 
02:44:35.700 --> 02:44:36.790 align:start position:0%
non-profits that are serving our
communities

02:44:36.790 --> 02:44:36.800 align:start position:0%
communities
 
02:44:40.070 --> 02:44:40.080 align:start position:0%
and I think in particular I just had a
 
02:44:41.950 --> 02:44:41.960 align:start position:0%
conversation the other day with
 
02:44:45.710 --> 02:44:45.720 align:start position:0%
Restoration Church pastors and they have
 
02:44:49.849 --> 02:44:49.859 align:start position:0%
built some recovery housing and uh you
 
02:44:51.650 --> 02:44:51.660 align:start position:0%
know I think about the kinds of ways in
 
02:44:54.469 --> 02:44:54.479 align:start position:0%
which there's a lot of open rooftops and
 
02:44:56.450 --> 02:44:56.460 align:start position:0%
a lot of churches as you might see it as
 
02:44:58.969 --> 02:44:58.979 align:start position:0%
providing lower cost power
 
02:45:01.670 --> 02:45:01.680 align:start position:0%
um for their car you know to do their
 
02:45:03.410 --> 02:45:03.420 align:start position:0%
operation but also for ancillary
 
02:45:05.510 --> 02:45:05.520 align:start position:0%
activities that might benefit the public
 
02:45:08.450 --> 02:45:08.460 align:start position:0%
that one seems pretty important plus
 
02:45:09.830 --> 02:45:09.840 align:start position:0%
you're familiar with conversations
 
02:45:11.510 --> 02:45:11.520 align:start position:0%
around peas and around the housing
 
02:45:13.670 --> 02:45:13.680 align:start position:0%
authorities so that's what it does Mr
 
02:45:16.190 --> 02:45:16.200 align:start position:0%
chairman let me do note that we had no
 
02:45:18.290 --> 02:45:18.300 align:start position:0%
opposition to this bill in the Senate
 
02:45:21.590 --> 02:45:21.600 align:start position:0%
and as on Senate Bill 68 and now on
 
02:45:24.309 --> 02:45:24.319 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 69 Josh Elliott
 
02:45:26.570 --> 02:45:26.580 align:start position:0%
representative Department of energy on
 
02:45:29.330 --> 02:45:29.340 align:start position:0%
both bills as being neutral
 
02:45:32.389 --> 02:45:32.399 align:start position:0%
on this so whatever other conversations
 
02:45:33.889 --> 02:45:33.899 align:start position:0%
there are that's what we heard in the
 
02:45:36.410 --> 02:45:36.420 align:start position:0%
Senate thank you Mr chairman
 
02:45:38.450 --> 02:45:38.460 align:start position:0%
questions for Senator water is
 
02:45:40.969 --> 02:45:40.979 align:start position:0%
representative Corman has one thank you
 
02:45:43.190 --> 02:45:43.200 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman and thank you Senator Waters
 
02:45:46.550 --> 02:45:46.560 align:start position:0%
I read the Senate hearing report yeah
 
02:45:49.610 --> 02:45:49.620 align:start position:0%
and what I gathered from that was that
 
02:45:52.130 --> 02:45:52.140 align:start position:0%
there there was an amendment to the bill
 
02:45:55.250 --> 02:45:55.260 align:start position:0%
is introduced and the Amendments the
 
02:45:56.690 --> 02:45:56.700 align:start position:0%
amendment really just added
 
02:45:59.570 --> 02:45:59.580 align:start position:0%
clarification about hospitals and Bona
 
02:46:02.929 --> 02:46:02.939 align:start position:0%
Fida religious organizations
 
02:46:04.670 --> 02:46:04.680 align:start position:0%
um but what I saw in the hearing in the
 
02:46:06.889 --> 02:46:06.899 align:start position:0%
Senate hearing report was that somehow
 
02:46:10.309 --> 02:46:10.319 align:start position:0%
the amended bill was going to clarify
 
02:46:12.469 --> 02:46:12.479 align:start position:0%
that non-profits can combine with
 
02:46:16.010 --> 02:46:16.020 align:start position:0%
municipalities to form a group host and
 
02:46:19.429 --> 02:46:19.439 align:start position:0%
I'm just not understanding how adding
 
02:46:21.429 --> 02:46:21.439 align:start position:0%
hospitals and religious organizations
 
02:46:24.530 --> 02:46:24.540 align:start position:0%
clarifies that nonprofits can combine
 
02:46:27.230 --> 02:46:27.240 align:start position:0%
with municipalities to form group hosts
 
02:46:29.450 --> 02:46:29.460 align:start position:0%
you know um
 
02:46:32.990 --> 02:46:33.000 align:start position:0%
I am not sure that I recall that
 
02:46:35.750 --> 02:46:35.760 align:start position:0%
conversation within the hearing what I
 
02:46:37.490 --> 02:46:37.500 align:start position:0%
worked on in that amendment I mean as
 
02:46:40.849 --> 02:46:40.859 align:start position:0%
it's Senator avard's Bill was making
 
02:46:43.190 --> 02:46:43.200 align:start position:0%
sure the same utility franchise service
 
02:46:46.070 --> 02:46:46.080 align:start position:0%
territory that was an important one for
 
02:46:48.950 --> 02:46:48.960 align:start position:0%
us and I believe that was part of the uh
 
02:46:51.770 --> 02:46:51.780 align:start position:0%
some Amendment we were working on as
 
02:46:53.510 --> 02:46:53.520 align:start position:0%
well but I I don't have it in front of
 
02:46:54.650 --> 02:46:54.660 align:start position:0%
me but
 
02:46:57.230 --> 02:46:57.240 align:start position:0%
what you see is what you get and I think
 
02:46:59.570 --> 02:46:59.580 align:start position:0%
that keeping it kind of exclusive to
 
02:47:01.969 --> 02:47:01.979 align:start position:0%
non-profits really probably makes some
 
02:47:05.510 --> 02:47:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:07.610 --> 02:47:07.620 align:start position:0%
further questions representative munz
 
02:47:09.950 --> 02:47:09.960 align:start position:0%
has one thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
02:47:11.990 --> 02:47:12.000 align:start position:0%
again Senator Waters
 
02:47:12.000 --> 02:47:12.770 align:start position:0%
again Senator Waters
um

02:47:12.770 --> 02:47:12.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:47:14.750 --> 02:47:14.760 align:start position:0%
was there any discussion in the senate
 
02:47:16.790 --> 02:47:16.800 align:start position:0%
about clarifying
 
02:47:19.610 --> 02:47:19.620 align:start position:0%
a little bit more exactly exactly what a
 
02:47:21.770 --> 02:47:21.780 align:start position:0%
non-profit is I mean I I was struck by
 
02:47:23.330 --> 02:47:23.340 align:start position:0%
the fact that unless it's defined
 
02:47:25.790 --> 02:47:25.800 align:start position:0%
someplace else but I was struck by the
 
02:47:27.650 --> 02:47:27.660 align:start position:0%
fact that there was no requirement that
 
02:47:29.450 --> 02:47:29.460 align:start position:0%
it be red that it'd be an organization
 
02:47:31.250 --> 02:47:31.260 align:start position:0%
that's registered with the New Hampshire
 
02:47:34.250 --> 02:47:34.260 align:start position:0%
Department of Justice's charitable trust
 
02:47:36.309 --> 02:47:36.319 align:start position:0%
unit or have an IRS
 
02:47:40.969 --> 02:47:40.979 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:40.979 --> 02:47:42.230 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:47:42.230 --> 02:47:42.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:47:44.690 --> 02:47:44.700 align:start position:0%
I I'm you know I've had a lot of
 
02:47:46.309 --> 02:47:46.319 align:start position:0%
experience with non-profits on boards
 
02:47:48.530 --> 02:47:48.540 align:start position:0%
and so on and I believe that you do have
 
02:47:50.809 --> 02:47:50.819 align:start position:0%
to register to have that status and uh
 
02:47:53.630 --> 02:47:53.640 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure there's a specific unless
 
02:47:53.640 --> 02:47:55.429 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure there's a specific unless
I'm

02:47:55.429 --> 02:47:55.439 align:start position:0%
I'm
 
02:47:55.439 --> 02:47:56.530 align:start position:0%
I'm
not

02:47:56.530 --> 02:47:56.540 align:start position:0%
not
 
02:47:58.849 --> 02:47:58.859 align:start position:0%
understanding each of the statutes that
 
02:48:00.830 --> 02:48:00.840 align:start position:0%
are referenced here
 
02:48:00.840 --> 02:48:01.429 align:start position:0%
are referenced here
um

02:48:01.429 --> 02:48:01.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:48:04.309 --> 02:48:04.319 align:start position:0%
but if if uh if there is an explicit
 
02:48:05.690 --> 02:48:05.700 align:start position:0%
reference to that definition there
 
02:48:07.370 --> 02:48:07.380 align:start position:0%
probably ought to be but we do have that
 
02:48:09.110 --> 02:48:09.120 align:start position:0%
in statute what qualifies as a
 
02:48:10.429 --> 02:48:10.439 align:start position:0%
non-profit and how you're registered
 
02:48:14.450 --> 02:48:14.460 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:16.750 --> 02:48:16.760 align:start position:0%
follow-up follow-up
 
02:48:19.550 --> 02:48:19.560 align:start position:0%
so is that a is that a a potential
 
02:48:21.110 --> 02:48:21.120 align:start position:0%
amendment that you could support where
 
02:48:23.690 --> 02:48:23.700 align:start position:0%
even if we just included a you know
 
02:48:25.670 --> 02:48:25.680 align:start position:0%
something that says non-profit as
 
02:48:27.950 --> 02:48:27.960 align:start position:0%
defined in
 
02:48:33.889 --> 02:48:33.899 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:37.250 --> 02:48:37.260 align:start position:0%
oh well it's
 
02:48:39.710 --> 02:48:39.720 align:start position:0%
see I think that it was down around 28 I
 
02:48:41.330 --> 02:48:41.340 align:start position:0%
think that just referring back up to
 
02:48:44.270 --> 02:48:44.280 align:start position:0%
this end of this bill the 2G that we're
 
02:48:45.349 --> 02:48:45.359 align:start position:0%
adding here
 
02:48:46.670 --> 02:48:46.680 align:start position:0%
um in terms of the definition of
 
02:48:49.490 --> 02:48:49.500 align:start position:0%
non-profit if if this doesn't already
 
02:48:53.210 --> 02:48:53.220 align:start position:0%
in 362 A1 already defined that then I
 
02:48:54.650 --> 02:48:54.660 align:start position:0%
think what you're suggesting makes sense
 
02:48:56.150 --> 02:48:56.160 align:start position:0%
but I will say I cannot speak for
 
02:48:58.550 --> 02:48:58.560 align:start position:0%
Senator Evart but I suspect that he
 
02:49:03.290 --> 02:49:03.300 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:05.150 --> 02:49:05.160 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee
 
02:49:07.429 --> 02:49:07.439 align:start position:0%
represent representative Corman has
 
02:49:10.309 --> 02:49:10.319 align:start position:0%
another one thank you Mr chairman and I
 
02:49:11.990 --> 02:49:12.000 align:start position:0%
actually have a similar question to
 
02:49:14.210 --> 02:49:14.220 align:start position:0%
representative Moses not about nonprofit
 
02:49:16.309 --> 02:49:16.319 align:start position:0%
but what is a bona Fida religious
 
02:49:19.070 --> 02:49:19.080 align:start position:0%
organization actually search the rsas to
 
02:49:20.570 --> 02:49:20.580 align:start position:0%
see if there was a definition of that
 
02:49:23.030 --> 02:49:23.040 align:start position:0%
and at least in State Statute I could
 
02:49:25.309 --> 02:49:25.319 align:start position:0%
not find one and I'm just wondering you
 
02:49:27.110 --> 02:49:27.120 align:start position:0%
know who decides you know can I just set
 
02:49:31.370 --> 02:49:31.380 align:start position:0%
up the Church of Corman and apply
 
02:49:31.380 --> 02:49:32.630 align:start position:0%
up the Church of Corman and apply
um

02:49:32.630 --> 02:49:32.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:49:36.950 --> 02:49:36.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:38.389 --> 02:49:38.399 align:start position:0%
and do you want to do a net metering
 
02:49:40.610 --> 02:49:40.620 align:start position:0%
it's Millions
 
02:49:44.210 --> 02:49:44.220 align:start position:0%
um uh a good question I will defer that
 
02:49:46.849 --> 02:49:46.859 align:start position:0%
to a chance to look at statute because
 
02:49:49.070 --> 02:49:49.080 align:start position:0%
it may be as well that you want to the
 
02:49:51.170 --> 02:49:51.180 align:start position:0%
point here is non-profit isn't it and
 
02:49:52.790 --> 02:49:52.800 align:start position:0%
you look at
 
02:49:52.800 --> 02:49:54.410 align:start position:0%
you look at
um

02:49:54.410 --> 02:49:54.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:49:56.809 --> 02:49:56.819 align:start position:0%
you look at the language before operate
 
02:49:59.690 --> 02:49:59.700 align:start position:0%
as a not-for-profit or a non-profit so
 
02:50:02.270 --> 02:50:02.280 align:start position:0%
that non-profit would describe what
 
02:50:03.950 --> 02:50:03.960 align:start position:0%
follows after it including Bonafide
 
02:50:06.349 --> 02:50:06.359 align:start position:0%
Buddhist organizations which I suspect
 
02:50:09.410 --> 02:50:09.420 align:start position:0%
back to the previous question would um
 
02:50:12.170 --> 02:50:12.180 align:start position:0%
be that such a bona fide religious
 
02:50:13.490 --> 02:50:13.500 align:start position:0%
organizations that are registers
 
02:50:16.370 --> 02:50:16.380 align:start position:0%
non-profits that seems to be the issue
 
02:50:17.929 --> 02:50:17.939 align:start position:0%
not whether we're trying to Define what
 
02:50:20.090 --> 02:50:20.100 align:start position:0%
a religious organization may qualify or
 
02:50:22.250 --> 02:50:22.260 align:start position:0%
not and it may so I will look into the
 
02:50:24.110 --> 02:50:24.120 align:start position:0%
statute about that again I will I'll
 
02:50:26.750 --> 02:50:26.760 align:start position:0%
talk to Senator avard but that may be
 
02:50:32.570 --> 02:50:32.580 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:34.849 --> 02:50:34.859 align:start position:0%
okay seeing no further questions I want
 
02:50:36.650 --> 02:50:36.660 align:start position:0%
to thank you Senator waters for
 
02:50:39.650 --> 02:50:39.660 align:start position:0%
introducing this bill and I'm going to
 
02:50:41.870 --> 02:50:41.880 align:start position:0%
suspend thank you for accommodating you
 
02:50:43.849 --> 02:50:43.859 align:start position:0%
bet I'm going to suspend this public
 
02:50:46.790 --> 02:50:46.800 align:start position:0%
hearing until after lunch
 
02:50:49.190 --> 02:50:49.200 align:start position:0%
and now I'm going to open a public
 
02:50:51.670 --> 02:50:51.680 align:start position:0%
hearing on Senate Bill 79 and ask
 
02:50:55.670 --> 02:50:55.680 align:start position:0%
representative Lang to introduce this
 
02:50:58.730 --> 02:50:58.740 align:start position:0%
legislation and just uh so everybody
 
02:51:01.070 --> 02:51:01.080 align:start position:0%
will be clear as to the process we're
 
02:51:03.469 --> 02:51:03.479 align:start position:0%
also going to suspend this public
 
02:51:05.990 --> 02:51:06.000 align:start position:0%
hearing as soon as Senator Lang
 
02:51:08.090 --> 02:51:08.100 align:start position:0%
introduces the bill we're going to take
 
02:51:10.370 --> 02:51:10.380 align:start position:0%
a lunch break then we're going to come
 
02:51:15.349 --> 02:51:15.359 align:start position:0%
back and resume the Senate bill 68.
 
02:51:17.690 --> 02:51:17.700 align:start position:0%
public hearing then when we finish that
 
02:51:20.030 --> 02:51:20.040 align:start position:0%
we're going to resume the Senate Bill 69
 
02:51:22.250 --> 02:51:22.260 align:start position:0%
public hearing and then when we finish
 
02:51:25.790 --> 02:51:25.800 align:start position:0%
that we'll resume this public hearing
 
02:51:27.770 --> 02:51:27.780 align:start position:0%
so that's what's going to happen over
 
02:51:29.570 --> 02:51:29.580 align:start position:0%
the course of the rest of the day so
 
02:51:31.849 --> 02:51:31.859 align:start position:0%
Senator Lang go ahead and introduce this
 
02:51:34.190 --> 02:51:34.200 align:start position:0%
legislation thank you Mr chairman I take
 
02:51:35.630 --> 02:51:35.640 align:start position:0%
back all the things I said out in the
 
02:51:37.250 --> 02:51:37.260 align:start position:0%
hallway when I left and told I had to
 
02:51:39.050 --> 02:51:39.060 align:start position:0%
come back at two o'clock and I guess
 
02:51:40.370 --> 02:51:40.380 align:start position:0%
someone told me that makes me a true
 
02:51:42.050 --> 02:51:42.060 align:start position:0%
center now is complaining about the
 
02:51:43.250 --> 02:51:43.260 align:start position:0%
house so
 
02:51:46.550 --> 02:51:46.560 align:start position:0%
um so thank you for taking my testimony
 
02:51:48.410 --> 02:51:48.420 align:start position:0%
um so this bill
 
02:51:51.110 --> 02:51:51.120 align:start position:0%
um is a manufacturing and Industrial
 
02:51:53.090 --> 02:51:53.100 align:start position:0%
bill right so one of the things we've
 
02:51:54.769 --> 02:51:54.779 align:start position:0%
all heard from our constituents is that
 
02:51:56.630 --> 02:51:56.640 align:start position:0%
electric prices are through the roof and
 
02:51:58.070 --> 02:51:58.080 align:start position:0%
that's even 10 times worse for our
 
02:52:00.889 --> 02:52:00.899 align:start position:0%
businesses and so what this bill looks
 
02:52:02.929 --> 02:52:02.939 align:start position:0%
to give them an alternative
 
02:52:04.730 --> 02:52:04.740 align:start position:0%
um I keep I was thinking the net
 
02:52:05.929 --> 02:52:05.939 align:start position:0%
metering bills are kind of like license
 
02:52:07.370 --> 02:52:07.380 align:start position:0%
plate bills every time you allow
 
02:52:08.809 --> 02:52:08.819 align:start position:0%
something add-on somebody's going to add
 
02:52:10.309 --> 02:52:10.319 align:start position:0%
another request for a different type of
 
02:52:12.230 --> 02:52:12.240 align:start position:0%
license plate this is the same thing for
 
02:52:13.610 --> 02:52:13.620 align:start position:0%
net metering we're adding for looking
 
02:52:16.070 --> 02:52:16.080 align:start position:0%
for another exemption to the one
 
02:52:18.070 --> 02:52:18.080 align:start position:0%
megawatt limit
 
02:52:21.170 --> 02:52:21.180 align:start position:0%
so probably the most important language
 
02:52:23.090 --> 02:52:23.100 align:start position:0%
I think that's in here is if you're
 
02:52:25.309 --> 02:52:25.319 align:start position:0%
looking at the the Senate bill is online
 
02:52:27.230 --> 02:52:27.240 align:start position:0%
it's 18 18 and 19 what makes us
 
02:52:29.210 --> 02:52:29.220 align:start position:0%
different and it says in no instance
 
02:52:30.590 --> 02:52:30.600 align:start position:0%
shall electrical generation facility
 
02:52:32.269 --> 02:52:32.279 align:start position:0%
exceed a hundred percent of the
 
02:52:33.650 --> 02:52:33.660 align:start position:0%
industrial host's average electric
 
02:52:36.710 --> 02:52:36.720 align:start position:0%
consumption over the past 12 months so
 
02:52:38.150 --> 02:52:38.160 align:start position:0%
our goal here is not to make a revenue
 
02:52:39.710 --> 02:52:39.720 align:start position:0%
stream I know with net metering group
 
02:52:41.630 --> 02:52:41.640 align:start position:0%
net metering the argument's always been
 
02:52:42.950 --> 02:52:42.960 align:start position:0%
the light bulb out in the field right
 
02:52:44.090 --> 02:52:44.100 align:start position:0%
you put a light bulb out in the field
 
02:52:45.469 --> 02:52:45.479 align:start position:0%
put a meter on it and then you throw a
 
02:52:48.050 --> 02:52:48.060 align:start position:0%
five megawatt megawatt uh solar array
 
02:52:49.550 --> 02:52:49.560 align:start position:0%
behind it and just generate revenue for
 
02:52:51.530 --> 02:52:51.540 align:start position:0%
yourself that's not what we're looking
 
02:52:53.389 --> 02:52:53.399 align:start position:0%
to do here what we're looking to do is
 
02:52:55.670 --> 02:52:55.680 align:start position:0%
help our New Hampshire businesses reduce
 
02:52:57.889 --> 02:52:57.899 align:start position:0%
their electrical costs so that they can
 
02:52:59.929 --> 02:52:59.939 align:start position:0%
compete in our Market
 
02:52:59.939 --> 02:53:00.590 align:start position:0%
compete in our Market
um

02:53:00.590 --> 02:53:00.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:53:02.389 --> 02:53:02.399 align:start position:0%
I I will say we've been playing with
 
02:53:04.130 --> 02:53:04.140 align:start position:0%
ways and means over in the senate about
 
02:53:05.870 --> 02:53:05.880 align:start position:0%
same kind of language how can we help
 
02:53:07.670 --> 02:53:07.680 align:start position:0%
these businesses through Capital
 
02:53:10.490 --> 02:53:10.500 align:start position:0%
expenditures uh reduce some costs so
 
02:53:12.769 --> 02:53:12.779 align:start position:0%
they can compete in in a in a market
 
02:53:15.290 --> 02:53:15.300 align:start position:0%
that has that crosses state lines I
 
02:53:16.610 --> 02:53:16.620 align:start position:0%
think this is one of the bills that can
 
02:53:17.870 --> 02:53:17.880 align:start position:0%
do that
 
02:53:20.690 --> 02:53:20.700 align:start position:0%
um where we can allow for businesses to
 
02:53:22.070 --> 02:53:22.080 align:start position:0%
allow to generate enough electric
 
02:53:25.190 --> 02:53:25.200 align:start position:0%
consumption up to their 100 capacity
 
02:53:28.429 --> 02:53:28.439 align:start position:0%
whatever they use they can generate and
 
02:53:31.550 --> 02:53:31.560 align:start position:0%
use the grid for the off and on so one
 
02:53:33.110 --> 02:53:33.120 align:start position:0%
of the arguments is around how does this
 
02:53:35.510 --> 02:53:35.520 align:start position:0%
help businesses so remember businesses
 
02:53:36.889 --> 02:53:36.899 align:start position:0%
will generate electricity on Saturday
 
02:53:38.389 --> 02:53:38.399 align:start position:0%
and Sunday when aren't necessarily open
 
02:53:39.950 --> 02:53:39.960 align:start position:0%
so while they may consume 100
 
02:53:43.490 --> 02:53:43.500 align:start position:0%
electricity or 80 electricity or 100 you
 
02:53:45.469 --> 02:53:45.479 align:start position:0%
know there's a hundred they need 110 so
 
02:53:46.670 --> 02:53:46.680 align:start position:0%
they're not generating enough and
 
02:53:48.050 --> 02:53:48.060 align:start position:0%
pulling off the grid their weekend
 
02:53:50.929 --> 02:53:50.939 align:start position:0%
generation will allow them to make that
 
02:53:52.070 --> 02:53:52.080 align:start position:0%
back up and help them with their
 
02:53:53.870 --> 02:53:53.880 align:start position:0%
electrical costs I'll remind you that
 
02:53:56.150 --> 02:53:56.160 align:start position:0%
the puc has a docket open which I'm sure
 
02:53:58.090 --> 02:53:58.100 align:start position:0%
you're all familiar with about studying
 
02:54:00.469 --> 02:54:00.479 align:start position:0%
net metering rates and what's going to
 
02:54:03.410 --> 02:54:03.420 align:start position:0%
be paid the idea again here isn't to pay
 
02:54:05.269 --> 02:54:05.279 align:start position:0%
the retail rate and the high consumption
 
02:54:06.530 --> 02:54:06.540 align:start position:0%
rate the ideal is to pay something
 
02:54:08.389 --> 02:54:08.399 align:start position:0%
between wholesale and Retail to give
 
02:54:10.429 --> 02:54:10.439 align:start position:0%
them an ability to
 
02:54:10.439 --> 02:54:11.170 align:start position:0%
them an ability to
um

02:54:11.170 --> 02:54:11.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:54:14.269 --> 02:54:14.279 align:start position:0%
to pay pay for to offset their
 
02:54:16.070 --> 02:54:16.080 align:start position:0%
electrical costs and again at the end of
 
02:54:17.210 --> 02:54:17.220 align:start position:0%
the year
 
02:54:19.730 --> 02:54:19.740 align:start position:0%
it's 100 capacity is where they're at so
 
02:54:21.290 --> 02:54:21.300 align:start position:0%
it's anything over that they're going to
 
02:54:23.090 --> 02:54:23.100 align:start position:0%
have to go down to the wholesale rate
 
02:54:24.650 --> 02:54:24.660 align:start position:0%
which is I believe what the current net
 
02:54:26.990 --> 02:54:27.000 align:start position:0%
metering statute does so in there so
 
02:54:28.969 --> 02:54:28.979 align:start position:0%
happy to take questions a little bit
 
02:54:32.150 --> 02:54:32.160 align:start position:0%
long-winded apologize but
 
02:54:35.170 --> 02:54:35.180 align:start position:0%
thank you for introducing Senate Bill 79
 
02:54:38.330 --> 02:54:38.340 align:start position:0%
representative munz has a question thank
 
02:54:40.790 --> 02:54:40.800 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and thank you Senator at
 
02:54:42.889 --> 02:54:42.899 align:start position:0%
the risk of being pigeonholed as the
 
02:54:45.590 --> 02:54:45.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:51.170 --> 02:54:51.180 align:start position:0%
um in um in line 16 we talk about
 
02:54:53.269 --> 02:54:53.279 align:start position:0%
commercial industrial or institutional
 
02:54:56.269 --> 02:54:56.279 align:start position:0%
entities is it clear what those are
 
02:54:58.490 --> 02:54:58.500 align:start position:0%
do we need to clarify that
 
02:55:02.150 --> 02:55:02.160 align:start position:0%
so there's no um there is no specific uh
 
02:55:03.710 --> 02:55:03.720 align:start position:0%
definition in New Year right Mr
 
02:55:03.720 --> 02:55:05.330 align:start position:0%
definition in New Year right Mr
definition

02:55:05.330 --> 02:55:05.340 align:start position:0%
definition
 
02:55:07.730 --> 02:55:07.740 align:start position:0%
um and I I would argue that a license
 
02:55:10.010 --> 02:55:10.020 align:start position:0%
would probably do that right so all of
 
02:55:11.570 --> 02:55:11.580 align:start position:0%
our businesses have licenses in the
 
02:55:12.650 --> 02:55:12.660 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire you have to
 
02:55:14.150 --> 02:55:14.160 align:start position:0%
register with the Secretary of State's
 
02:55:15.830 --> 02:55:15.840 align:start position:0%
office to do business in the state of
 
02:55:17.269 --> 02:55:17.279 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire so that would probably be
 
02:55:20.090 --> 02:55:20.100 align:start position:0%
where I would look for the definition
 
02:55:20.100 --> 02:55:21.950 align:start position:0%
where I would look for the definition
follow-up

02:55:21.950 --> 02:55:21.960 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
02:55:24.230 --> 02:55:24.240 align:start position:0%
follow up so that would be something
 
02:55:26.269 --> 02:55:26.279 align:start position:0%
that you wouldn't be opposed to adding
 
02:55:27.830 --> 02:55:27.840 align:start position:0%
some reference to
 
02:55:29.990 --> 02:55:30.000 align:start position:0%
that not at all when this bill first
 
02:55:32.630 --> 02:55:32.640 align:start position:0%
came out um I know the department of
 
02:55:34.490 --> 02:55:34.500 align:start position:0%
energy had some problem Josh I think his
 
02:55:36.710 --> 02:55:36.720 align:start position:0%
name is over there had some problems and
 
02:55:38.570 --> 02:55:38.580 align:start position:0%
we amended the bill in the Senate to
 
02:55:40.969 --> 02:55:40.979 align:start position:0%
take care of most of his concerns
 
02:55:43.490 --> 02:55:43.500 align:start position:0%
um so I would have no objection to a
 
02:55:46.250 --> 02:55:46.260 align:start position:0%
definition Amendment I'm just I I would
 
02:55:47.330 --> 02:55:47.340 align:start position:0%
look to the Secretary of State's office
 
02:55:48.349 --> 02:55:48.359 align:start position:0%
though to figure out how you can
 
02:55:50.269 --> 02:55:50.279 align:start position:0%
classify that kind of thing
 
02:55:54.410 --> 02:55:54.420 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:56.929 --> 02:55:56.939 align:start position:0%
okay I have a question for you since 60
 
02:55:59.150 --> 02:55:59.160 align:start position:0%
percent of the state's electricity is
 
02:56:04.630 --> 02:56:04.640 align:start position:0%
used by industrial commercial or
 
02:56:07.610 --> 02:56:07.620 align:start position:0%
institutional entities
 
02:56:10.250 --> 02:56:10.260 align:start position:0%
isn't this wouldn't this be a massive
 
02:56:14.389 --> 02:56:14.399 align:start position:0%
expansion of the net metering program
 
02:56:16.550 --> 02:56:16.560 align:start position:0%
if the assumption is 100 would take this
 
02:56:18.710 --> 02:56:18.720 align:start position:0%
up then yes I don't believe that's going
 
02:56:20.750 --> 02:56:20.760 align:start position:0%
to be the uptake on it you're going to
 
02:56:23.090 --> 02:56:23.100 align:start position:0%
see your your significant manufacturers
 
02:56:26.210 --> 02:56:26.220 align:start position:0%
I think do this so again you could see
 
02:56:29.929 --> 02:56:29.939 align:start position:0%
um you know again a CNC shops or what
 
02:56:32.290 --> 02:56:32.300 align:start position:0%
I'm thinking about these small
 
02:56:34.910 --> 02:56:34.920 align:start position:0%
high energy consumption due to the
 
02:56:36.290 --> 02:56:36.300 align:start position:0%
amount of electricity they consume for
 
02:56:37.790 --> 02:56:37.800 align:start position:0%
their machines where they get offset
 
02:56:39.710 --> 02:56:39.720 align:start position:0%
that load by
 
02:56:39.720 --> 02:56:40.849 align:start position:0%
that load by
um

02:56:40.849 --> 02:56:40.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:56:43.190 --> 02:56:43.200 align:start position:0%
by by putting solar up but I wouldn't
 
02:56:43.200 --> 02:56:44.510 align:start position:0%
by by putting solar up but I wouldn't
expect

02:56:44.510 --> 02:56:44.520 align:start position:0%
expect
 
02:56:46.309 --> 02:56:46.319 align:start position:0%
um a commercial entity like a small
 
02:56:47.809 --> 02:56:47.819 align:start position:0%
technology company
 
02:56:49.370 --> 02:56:49.380 align:start position:0%
wouldn't necessarily need it because
 
02:56:50.510 --> 02:56:50.520 align:start position:0%
they're just powering their local
 
02:56:52.490 --> 02:56:52.500 align:start position:0%
computers and it'd be a very small scale
 
02:56:55.790 --> 02:56:55.800 align:start position:0%
if anything which they could do now
 
02:56:57.769 --> 02:56:57.779 align:start position:0%
so my follow-up question would be since
 
02:57:00.650 --> 02:57:00.660 align:start position:0%
the vder studied recently completed
 
02:57:01.610 --> 02:57:01.620 align:start position:0%
you're gonna have to tell me what that
 
02:57:02.690 --> 02:57:02.700 align:start position:0%
is because I have no idea what that is
 
02:57:04.550 --> 02:57:04.560 align:start position:0%
that's the value of distributed energy
 
02:57:07.490 --> 02:57:07.500 align:start position:0%
resources study thank you that was done
 
02:57:10.610 --> 02:57:10.620 align:start position:0%
for the POC and the doe indicated that
 
02:57:13.429 --> 02:57:13.439 align:start position:0%
there is cost shifting from net metering
 
02:57:15.710 --> 02:57:15.720 align:start position:0%
to non-net metering customers maybe a
 
02:57:17.210 --> 02:57:17.220 align:start position:0%
small amount because of the low
 
02:57:20.150 --> 02:57:20.160 align:start position:0%
penetration of uh
 
02:57:22.670 --> 02:57:22.680 align:start position:0%
distributed energy resources at the
 
02:57:25.010 --> 02:57:25.020 align:start position:0%
moment but other studies show that as
 
02:57:27.710 --> 02:57:27.720 align:start position:0%
that percentage grows so does the cost
 
02:57:27.720 --> 02:57:29.330 align:start position:0%
that percentage grows so does the cost
shift

02:57:29.330 --> 02:57:29.340 align:start position:0%
shift
 
02:57:31.070 --> 02:57:31.080 align:start position:0%
does it trouble you that a massive
 
02:57:34.309 --> 02:57:34.319 align:start position:0%
increase in net metering would have a
 
02:57:37.550 --> 02:57:37.560 align:start position:0%
negative impact therefore on rate pairs
 
02:57:39.110 --> 02:57:39.120 align:start position:0%
so thank you for the question having not
 
02:57:40.969 --> 02:57:40.979 align:start position:0%
read that study I do know there was a
 
02:57:42.610 --> 02:57:42.620 align:start position:0%
study that said there was a small
 
02:57:45.349 --> 02:57:45.359 align:start position:0%
incremental possible cost shift that
 
02:57:51.170 --> 02:57:51.180 align:start position:0%
that occurred but again I I guess
 
02:57:53.389 --> 02:57:53.399 align:start position:0%
as the as the one that sponsored Senate
 
02:57:55.550 --> 02:57:55.560 align:start position:0%
Bill 109 that allowed it for the net
 
02:57:57.170 --> 02:57:57.180 align:start position:0%
metering for our municipalities and
 
02:57:59.510 --> 02:57:59.520 align:start position:0%
towns we haven't seen a large uptake of
 
02:58:03.349 --> 02:58:03.359 align:start position:0%
that of that um uh law that was passed
 
02:58:04.969 --> 02:58:04.979 align:start position:0%
two years ago
 
02:58:07.010 --> 02:58:07.020 align:start position:0%
um so I I don't know that you're going
 
02:58:08.990 --> 02:58:09.000 align:start position:0%
to see a massive uptake I what I do
 
02:58:10.370 --> 02:58:10.380 align:start position:0%
think is that the people that have
 
02:58:13.790 --> 02:58:13.800 align:start position:0%
extremely high energy consumption uh in
 
02:58:15.769 --> 02:58:15.779 align:start position:0%
our manufacturing will take advantage of
 
02:58:18.410 --> 02:58:18.420 align:start position:0%
this again I'll remind you that it's not
 
02:58:21.050 --> 02:58:21.060 align:start position:0%
to the ex not to excess so there will
 
02:58:22.790 --> 02:58:22.800 align:start position:0%
also be an offset if they end up
 
02:58:24.830 --> 02:58:24.840 align:start position:0%
producing 125 percent of their annual
 
02:58:26.809 --> 02:58:26.819 align:start position:0%
consumption that 25 will be dumped onto
 
02:58:28.190 --> 02:58:28.200 align:start position:0%
the Grid at the wholesale rate which is
 
02:58:30.290 --> 02:58:30.300 align:start position:0%
the same rate that would be
 
02:58:31.730 --> 02:58:31.740 align:start position:0%
um charged if they were buying it from
 
02:58:34.010 --> 02:58:34.020 align:start position:0%
anywhere else
 
02:58:36.889 --> 02:58:36.899 align:start position:0%
any additional questions for the bill
 
02:58:36.899 --> 02:58:38.750 align:start position:0%
any additional questions for the bill
sponsor

02:58:38.750 --> 02:58:38.760 align:start position:0%
sponsor
 
02:58:40.550 --> 02:58:40.560 align:start position:0%
representative McGee ask a question
 
02:58:42.429 --> 02:58:42.439 align:start position:0%
you're going to have
 
02:58:44.570 --> 02:58:44.580 align:start position:0%
representative Mickey I can't see it
 
02:58:46.070 --> 02:58:46.080 align:start position:0%
when you're just short
 
02:58:49.070 --> 02:58:49.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:49.080 --> 02:58:49.849 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:58:49.849 --> 02:58:49.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:58:52.370 --> 02:58:52.380 align:start position:0%
so the point of the bill is to help
 
02:58:56.269 --> 02:58:56.279 align:start position:0%
businesses lower costs right and we had
 
02:59:00.110 --> 02:59:00.120 align:start position:0%
an increase in costs that the spike uh
 
02:59:01.969 --> 02:59:01.979 align:start position:0%
last year that continues for many many
 
02:59:03.530 --> 02:59:03.540 align:start position:0%
people and certainly businesses are
 
02:59:05.090 --> 02:59:05.100 align:start position:0%
feeling that higher so I really
 
02:59:07.849 --> 02:59:07.859 align:start position:0%
appreciate the bill can you say a little
 
02:59:12.110 --> 02:59:12.120 align:start position:0%
bit more about lines 18 and 19 and how
 
02:59:14.510 --> 02:59:14.520 align:start position:0%
it distinguishes this bill
 
02:59:16.849 --> 02:59:16.859 align:start position:0%
um but for the concerns of you know cost
 
02:59:20.090 --> 02:59:20.100 align:start position:0%
shifting if they're uh in no instance
 
02:59:22.070 --> 02:59:22.080 align:start position:0%
shall the electric generating facility
 
02:59:24.170 --> 02:59:24.180 align:start position:0%
exceed 100 of the industrial host's
 
02:59:25.790 --> 02:59:25.800 align:start position:0%
average electric consumption over the
 
02:59:28.550 --> 02:59:28.560 align:start position:0%
past 12 months so what you're saying is
 
02:59:31.070 --> 02:59:31.080 align:start position:0%
lower your bills by producing energy
 
02:59:32.750 --> 02:59:32.760 align:start position:0%
that you're going to consume that you
 
02:59:33.830 --> 02:59:33.840 align:start position:0%
know you're going to consume you're not
 
02:59:35.030 --> 02:59:35.040 align:start position:0%
going to be
 
02:59:37.490 --> 02:59:37.500 align:start position:0%
absolutely the whole idea here is scale
 
02:59:39.410 --> 02:59:39.420 align:start position:0%
right so if I'm only consuming 1.5
 
02:59:41.690 --> 02:59:41.700 align:start position:0%
megawatts I want to throw a 1.5 megawatt
 
02:59:43.309 --> 02:59:43.319 align:start position:0%
array up I don't want to throw a two up
 
02:59:45.410 --> 02:59:45.420 align:start position:0%
because I'll exceed the capacity I may
 
02:59:47.750 --> 02:59:47.760 align:start position:0%
build a build one that has the ability
 
02:59:49.730 --> 02:59:49.740 align:start position:0%
to grow as my business grows and so I
 
02:59:51.950 --> 02:59:51.960 align:start position:0%
could add on to it but the goal here is
 
02:59:53.690 --> 02:59:53.700 align:start position:0%
not to create a revenue generation a
 
02:59:55.010 --> 02:59:55.020 align:start position:0%
goal is offset and one thing I'll remind
 
02:59:57.050 --> 02:59:57.060 align:start position:0%
you is that every one of our businesses
 
02:59:58.610 --> 02:59:58.620 align:start position:0%
that will
 
02:59:58.620 --> 02:59:59.389 align:start position:0%
that will
um

02:59:59.389 --> 02:59:59.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:00:01.910 --> 03:00:01.920 align:start position:0%
that will potentially take a available a
 
03:00:05.090 --> 03:00:05.100 align:start position:0%
veil of this will also end up paying
 
03:00:06.710 --> 03:00:06.720 align:start position:0%
more in business and profit sex because
 
03:00:08.210 --> 03:00:08.220 align:start position:0%
they don't have the operating costs
 
03:00:09.889 --> 03:00:09.899 align:start position:0%
anymore because they've offset their
 
03:00:11.929 --> 03:00:11.939 align:start position:0%
electricity costs with with the
 
03:00:13.370 --> 03:00:13.380 align:start position:0%
electricity generation so that number
 
03:00:15.170 --> 03:00:15.180 align:start position:0%
goes to their profit line or to their
 
03:00:17.090 --> 03:00:17.100 align:start position:0%
wages to be able to hire more employees
 
03:00:18.650 --> 03:00:18.660 align:start position:0%
so again
 
03:00:22.490 --> 03:00:22.500 align:start position:0%
this by Saving not only by saving the uh
 
03:00:25.130 --> 03:00:25.140 align:start position:0%
the cons the business at Cost you've
 
03:00:26.570 --> 03:00:26.580 align:start position:0%
actually potentially increased the prop
 
03:00:28.130 --> 03:00:28.140 align:start position:0%
business profits because that money will
 
03:00:29.690 --> 03:00:29.700 align:start position:0%
be dumped into the profits there's no
 
03:00:31.730 --> 03:00:31.740 align:start position:0%
operating costs associated with it or
 
03:00:33.050 --> 03:00:33.060 align:start position:0%
they'll use it to hire more employees
 
03:00:34.010 --> 03:00:34.020 align:start position:0%
which will then go to the business
 
03:00:36.710 --> 03:00:36.720 align:start position:0%
Enterprise tax so again by lowering
 
03:00:38.929 --> 03:00:38.939 align:start position:0%
helping businesses compete they can grow
 
03:00:41.090 --> 03:00:41.100 align:start position:0%
and by helping
 
03:00:43.190 --> 03:00:43.200 align:start position:0%
um offset operational costs like this
 
03:00:46.429 --> 03:00:46.439 align:start position:0%
you will shift some revenue for some uh
 
03:00:47.990 --> 03:00:48.000 align:start position:0%
revenue of the business over to the
 
03:00:51.769 --> 03:00:51.779 align:start position:0%
profit side and what follow-up follow-up
 
03:00:54.110 --> 03:00:54.120 align:start position:0%
um and my follow-up would be along the
 
03:00:56.269 --> 03:00:56.279 align:start position:0%
lines of a point that was made earlier
 
03:00:58.190 --> 03:00:58.200 align:start position:0%
which is that it then becomes a business
 
03:01:00.170 --> 03:01:00.180 align:start position:0%
decision right everybody's not going to
 
03:01:02.870 --> 03:01:02.880 align:start position:0%
do this absolutely I again I agree not
 
03:01:04.010 --> 03:01:04.020 align:start position:0%
everybody's going to throw up a five
 
03:01:05.690 --> 03:01:05.700 align:start position:0%
Mega but they have the option but they
 
03:01:07.429 --> 03:01:07.439 align:start position:0%
have the choice to do that which is what
 
03:01:08.870 --> 03:01:08.880 align:start position:0%
I think we believe in is having giving
 
03:01:10.490 --> 03:01:10.500 align:start position:0%
businesses the choice on their side
 
03:01:12.170 --> 03:01:12.180 align:start position:0%
whether or not they do or don't want to
 
03:01:14.929 --> 03:01:14.939 align:start position:0%
do something we put one cap on here that
 
03:01:16.070 --> 03:01:16.080 align:start position:0%
says you can generate more than 100
 
03:01:17.690 --> 03:01:17.700 align:start position:0%
that's the one decision we took away
 
03:01:19.849 --> 03:01:19.859 align:start position:0%
from them as you get generate 150
 
03:01:21.469 --> 03:01:21.479 align:start position:0%
percent of your capacity and make
 
03:01:23.090 --> 03:01:23.100 align:start position:0%
revenue from this but you can generate
 
03:01:25.429 --> 03:01:25.439 align:start position:0%
up to 100 and offset your electric load
 
03:01:28.370 --> 03:01:28.380 align:start position:0%
thank you that's clear
 
03:01:32.450 --> 03:01:32.460 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:34.370 --> 03:01:34.380 align:start position:0%
seeing none I want to thank you for
 
03:01:37.010 --> 03:01:37.020 align:start position:0%
introducing this legislation and I am
 
03:01:39.110 --> 03:01:39.120 align:start position:0%
now going to suspend
 
03:01:43.550 --> 03:01:43.560 align:start position:0%
this public hearing at 12
 
03:01:47.870 --> 03:01:47.880 align:start position:0%
07 we will resume this public hearing
 
03:01:51.110 --> 03:01:51.120 align:start position:0%
after the resumed public hearings on
 
03:01:54.950 --> 03:01:54.960 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 68 and Senate Bill 69
 
03:01:58.790 --> 03:01:58.800 align:start position:0%
both of those bills will be heard uh in
 
03:02:00.830 --> 03:02:00.840 align:start position:0%
committee with a resumption of public
 
03:02:04.790 --> 03:02:04.800 align:start position:0%
hearings starting at one o'clock this
 
03:02:07.550 --> 03:02:07.560 align:start position:0%
afternoon 1 pm

03:59:48.410 --> 03:59:48.420 align:start position:0%
good afternoon welcome to sdne the floor
 
03:59:50.510 --> 03:59:50.520 align:start position:0%
is yours
 
03:59:51.889 --> 03:59:51.899 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:59:54.950 --> 03:59:54.960 align:start position:0%
this is an adventure for me
 
03:59:57.110 --> 03:59:57.120 align:start position:0%
um like I said I'm Kathleen Bigfoot I'm
 
03:59:59.269 --> 03:59:59.279 align:start position:0%
from Bradford New Hampshire I'm an
 
04:00:01.490 --> 04:00:01.500 align:start position:0%
initiator and a member of the Bradford
 
04:00:03.650 --> 04:00:03.660 align:start position:0%
energy committee and I thank you very
 
04:00:05.990 --> 04:00:06.000 align:start position:0%
much for this opportunity to speak with
 
04:00:09.410 --> 04:00:09.420 align:start position:0%
you today in support of SB 68.
 
04:00:11.510 --> 04:00:11.520 align:start position:0%
I along with the members of The Bradford
 
04:00:13.309 --> 04:00:13.319 align:start position:0%
energy committee wholeheartedly support
 
04:00:16.189 --> 04:00:16.199 align:start position:0%
SB 68 and hope that the committee will
 
04:00:19.670 --> 04:00:19.680 align:start position:0%
vote to pass it
 
04:00:21.010 --> 04:00:21.020 align:start position:0%
we applaud the New Hampshire
 
04:00:23.750 --> 04:00:23.760 align:start position:0%
legislature's forward-thinking strategy
 
04:00:26.210 --> 04:00:26.220 align:start position:0%
to bring the benefit of net metering to
 
04:00:29.269 --> 04:00:29.279 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's small municipalities
 
04:00:31.490 --> 04:00:31.500 align:start position:0%
there's a an aspect of this strategy
 
04:00:33.590 --> 04:00:33.600 align:start position:0%
that I would like to highlight it is
 
04:00:35.330 --> 04:00:35.340 align:start position:0%
slightly tangential and I understand
 
04:00:35.340 --> 04:00:37.070 align:start position:0%
slightly tangential and I understand
that

04:00:37.070 --> 04:00:37.080 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:00:40.070 --> 04:00:40.080 align:start position:0%
and this is that in the area surrounding
 
04:00:42.110 --> 04:00:42.120 align:start position:0%
Bradford New Hampshire electricity
 
04:00:44.030 --> 04:00:44.040 align:start position:0%
distribution from a renewable energy
 
04:00:46.189 --> 04:00:46.199 align:start position:0%
site is limited by the existing
 
04:00:50.990 --> 04:00:51.000 align:start position:0%
infrastructure to 100 kilowatts
 
04:00:53.090 --> 04:00:53.100 align:start position:0%
this means that even if a municipality
 
04:00:55.070 --> 04:00:55.080 align:start position:0%
could raise the money to attract an
 
04:00:57.590 --> 04:00:57.600 align:start position:0%
investor to build a one to five megawatt
 
04:00:58.849 --> 04:00:58.859 align:start position:0%
solar farm
 
04:01:02.510 --> 04:01:02.520 align:start position:0%
all but 100 kilowatts would be would
 
04:01:05.210 --> 04:01:05.220 align:start position:0%
need to be used on site because that is
 
04:01:07.189 --> 04:01:07.199 align:start position:0%
the amount of electricity the grid will
 
04:01:07.199 --> 04:01:08.929 align:start position:0%
the amount of electricity the grid will
accept

04:01:08.929 --> 04:01:08.939 align:start position:0%
accept
 
04:01:10.790 --> 04:01:10.800 align:start position:0%
we have researched many possibilities
 
04:01:13.610 --> 04:01:13.620 align:start position:0%
for placing a solar farm in Bradford and
 
04:01:15.110 --> 04:01:15.120 align:start position:0%
are coming to the conclusion that
 
04:01:17.570 --> 04:01:17.580 align:start position:0%
without distribution infrastructure that
 
04:01:20.269 --> 04:01:20.279 align:start position:0%
has much larger capacity we will need to
 
04:01:22.010 --> 04:01:22.020 align:start position:0%
find other ways to provide renewable
 
04:01:24.170 --> 04:01:24.180 align:start position:0%
energy to the town of residence to the
 
04:01:25.969 --> 04:01:25.979 align:start position:0%
town of Bradford its residents and
 
04:01:25.979 --> 04:01:27.290 align:start position:0%
town of Bradford its residents and
Beyond

04:01:27.290 --> 04:01:27.300 align:start position:0%
Beyond
 
04:01:28.910 --> 04:01:28.920 align:start position:0%
please vote
 
04:01:32.389 --> 04:01:32.399 align:start position:0%
ought to pass on SB 68 so that at the
 
04:01:34.189 --> 04:01:34.199 align:start position:0%
very least it can help raise awareness
 
04:01:36.290 --> 04:01:36.300 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire's electric grid needs
 
04:01:38.510 --> 04:01:38.520 align:start position:0%
to be expanded in rural areas to
 
04:01:41.630 --> 04:01:41.640 align:start position:0%
accommodate renewable energy generation
 
04:01:44.510 --> 04:01:44.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:48.650 --> 04:01:48.660 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions for
 
04:01:51.229 --> 04:01:51.239 align:start position:0%
representative Corman has a question yes
 
04:01:52.670 --> 04:01:52.680 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
04:01:54.889 --> 04:01:54.899 align:start position:0%
taking my question so am I to understand
 
04:01:56.750 --> 04:01:56.760 align:start position:0%
so well you said the electric
 
04:01:58.910 --> 04:01:58.920 align:start position:0%
distribution around Bradford is limited
 
04:02:01.969 --> 04:02:01.979 align:start position:0%
by infrastructure to 100 kilowatts is
 
04:02:03.889 --> 04:02:03.899 align:start position:0%
that thank you for asking that's correct
 
04:02:05.269 --> 04:02:05.279 align:start position:0%
yeah so
 
04:02:07.670 --> 04:02:07.680 align:start position:0%
does that is that a limitation of how
 
04:02:09.769 --> 04:02:09.779 align:start position:0%
much can get into Bradford what exactly
 
04:02:11.389 --> 04:02:11.399 align:start position:0%
what does that mean that's a limitation
 
04:02:14.689 --> 04:02:14.699 align:start position:0%
of how much can come off of a generation
 
04:02:17.269 --> 04:02:17.279 align:start position:0%
and that's how much can go into the grid
 
04:02:20.330 --> 04:02:20.340 align:start position:0%
okay at that point and many points
 
04:02:26.330 --> 04:02:26.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:28.309 --> 04:02:28.319 align:start position:0%
now I believe that an interconnection
 
04:02:31.550 --> 04:02:31.560 align:start position:0%
study should someone propose to to put
 
04:02:34.130 --> 04:02:34.140 align:start position:0%
new generation on the grid an
 
04:02:36.889 --> 04:02:36.899 align:start position:0%
interconnection study would be done and
 
04:02:41.150 --> 04:02:41.160 align:start position:0%
it would discover that the circuit on
 
04:02:44.030 --> 04:02:44.040 align:start position:0%
which the generation facility was going
 
04:02:46.429 --> 04:02:46.439 align:start position:0%
to be installed needed to be upgraded
 
04:02:48.170 --> 04:02:48.180 align:start position:0%
and it would
 
04:02:50.630 --> 04:02:50.640 align:start position:0%
indicate or or would figure out how much
 
04:02:53.929 --> 04:02:53.939 align:start position:0%
that would cost and then the generator
 
04:02:56.269 --> 04:02:56.279 align:start position:0%
would have the option of
 
04:02:59.389 --> 04:02:59.399 align:start position:0%
making that infrastructure upgrade in
 
04:03:01.610 --> 04:03:01.620 align:start position:0%
order to interconnect
 
04:03:04.010 --> 04:03:04.020 align:start position:0%
uh that's been part of our study
 
04:03:08.510 --> 04:03:08.520 align:start position:0%
and uh the expense of that uh is
 
04:03:11.030 --> 04:03:11.040 align:start position:0%
prohibitive at the moment
 
04:03:11.040 --> 04:03:12.410 align:start position:0%
prohibitive at the moment
okay

04:03:12.410 --> 04:03:12.420 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:03:18.710 --> 04:03:18.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:21.110 --> 04:03:21.120 align:start position:0%
seeing none we'll move on thank you
 
04:03:23.510 --> 04:03:23.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for being here to testify
 
04:03:27.110 --> 04:03:27.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:28.670 --> 04:03:28.680 align:start position:0%
you can thank our friends in the senate
 
04:03:31.490 --> 04:03:31.500 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:34.010 --> 04:03:34.020 align:start position:0%
next up is Patrick
 
04:03:43.010 --> 04:03:43.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:47.630 --> 04:03:47.640 align:start position:0%
okay next step is natural Grays of the
 
04:03:52.130 --> 04:03:52.140 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:54.229 --> 04:03:54.239 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair Nate craze from the
 
04:03:56.870 --> 04:03:56.880 align:start position:0%
municipal Association we do support this
 
04:03:59.269 --> 04:03:59.279 align:start position:0%
legislation has already been stated in
 
04:04:01.370 --> 04:04:01.380 align:start position:0%
testimony today this is a
 
04:04:04.849 --> 04:04:04.859 align:start position:0%
a simple bill that is most or I guess
 
04:04:06.950 --> 04:04:06.960 align:start position:0%
half of another bill that this committee
 
04:04:08.170 --> 04:04:08.180 align:start position:0%
has already heard
 
04:04:10.729 --> 04:04:10.739 align:start position:0%
so I won't reiterate things that you've
 
04:04:12.229 --> 04:04:12.239 align:start position:0%
already heard today I'm certainly not a
 
04:04:14.269 --> 04:04:14.279 align:start position:0%
technical expert so I'd ask you ask
 
04:04:16.849 --> 04:04:16.859 align:start position:0%
other people those questions
 
04:04:18.950 --> 04:04:18.960 align:start position:0%
um realistically we support this
 
04:04:20.870 --> 04:04:20.880 align:start position:0%
legislation because
 
04:04:22.969 --> 04:04:22.979 align:start position:0%
you've already heard a couple concrete
 
04:04:25.070 --> 04:04:25.080 align:start position:0%
examples of municipalities that have
 
04:04:27.590 --> 04:04:27.600 align:start position:0%
looked at projects unfortunately the
 
04:04:29.570 --> 04:04:29.580 align:start position:0%
project the best site for the project
 
04:04:33.170 --> 04:04:33.180 align:start position:0%
would be across a political boundary not
 
04:04:36.530 --> 04:04:36.540 align:start position:0%
a utility boundary and so we believe
 
04:04:39.250 --> 04:04:39.260 align:start position:0%
that this legislation will help resolve
 
04:04:42.590 --> 04:04:42.600 align:start position:0%
that that conflict and allow
 
04:04:44.750 --> 04:04:44.760 align:start position:0%
municipalities to better collaborate on
 
04:04:47.030 --> 04:04:47.040 align:start position:0%
these types of projects I'm happy to
 
04:04:48.950 --> 04:04:48.960 align:start position:0%
take any questions the committee may
 
04:04:54.729 --> 04:04:54.739 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:58.370 --> 04:04:58.380 align:start position:0%
representative Bernardi has a question
 
04:05:01.429 --> 04:05:01.439 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair about how many uh
 
04:05:05.210 --> 04:05:05.220 align:start position:0%
facilities or or potential placements
 
04:05:09.050 --> 04:05:09.060 align:start position:0%
like that are you aware of
 
04:05:10.790 --> 04:05:10.800 align:start position:0%
so I think there's probably about a
 
04:05:13.189 --> 04:05:13.199 align:start position:0%
handful of projects that have been uh
 
04:05:15.349 --> 04:05:15.359 align:start position:0%
explored at the moment I don't have an
 
04:05:16.670 --> 04:05:16.680 align:start position:0%
exact number because I'm not in the
 
04:05:19.849 --> 04:05:19.859 align:start position:0%
industry I do know that the um the
 
04:05:21.950 --> 04:05:21.960 align:start position:0%
Plainfield Cornish one was one example
 
04:05:24.530 --> 04:05:24.540 align:start position:0%
that's come to our attention uh over the
 
04:05:26.870 --> 04:05:26.880 align:start position:0%
past couple of years because that's
 
04:05:28.370 --> 04:05:28.380 align:start position:0%
something that that our members have
 
04:05:30.349 --> 04:05:30.359 align:start position:0%
brought to us and I believe there are a
 
04:05:32.510 --> 04:05:32.520 align:start position:0%
couple others in
 
04:05:34.010 --> 04:05:34.020 align:start position:0%
um other areas of the state where you
 
04:05:37.670 --> 04:05:37.680 align:start position:0%
have a similar situation that the
 
04:05:40.729 --> 04:05:40.739 align:start position:0%
um utility boundaries don't mirror the
 
04:05:43.250 --> 04:05:43.260 align:start position:0%
municipal boundaries and there's areas
 
04:05:45.050 --> 04:05:45.060 align:start position:0%
of the municipality that
 
04:05:46.670 --> 04:05:46.680 align:start position:0%
really there's no other development that
 
04:05:48.889 --> 04:05:48.899 align:start position:0%
would be suitable other than some sort
 
04:05:57.889 --> 04:05:57.899 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:59.750 --> 04:05:59.760 align:start position:0%
see no further questions I want to thank
 
04:06:02.330 --> 04:06:02.340 align:start position:0%
you for your testimony here this
 
04:06:05.750 --> 04:06:05.760 align:start position:0%
afternoon thank you next I'll call on
 
04:06:07.969 --> 04:06:07.979 align:start position:0%
Sam Evans Brown of clean energy New
 
04:06:07.979 --> 04:06:10.849 align:start position:0%
Sam Evans Brown of clean energy New
Hampshire

04:06:10.849 --> 04:06:10.859 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:12.769 --> 04:06:12.779 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Sam
 
04:06:12.779 --> 04:06:22.570 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Sam
foreign

04:06:22.570 --> 04:06:22.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:24.710 --> 04:06:24.720 align:start position:0%
for the record Sam Evans Brown the
 
04:06:25.910 --> 04:06:25.920 align:start position:0%
executive director of clean energy New
 
04:06:29.090 --> 04:06:29.100 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so I've I've uh handed uh
 
04:06:32.450 --> 04:06:32.460 align:start position:0%
handed in one well two two documents one
 
04:06:33.889 --> 04:06:33.899 align:start position:0%
is is clean energy New Hampshire's
 
04:06:36.229 --> 04:06:36.239 align:start position:0%
testimony the second is a letter that is
 
04:06:38.570 --> 04:06:38.580 align:start position:0%
signed by over a hundred members of
 
04:06:40.250 --> 04:06:40.260 align:start position:0%
local energy committees as well as
 
04:06:42.050 --> 04:06:42.060 align:start position:0%
Municipal officials
 
04:06:45.410 --> 04:06:45.420 align:start position:0%
um who have uh signed on in support of
 
04:06:47.570 --> 04:06:47.580 align:start position:0%
this piece of legislation
 
04:06:49.250 --> 04:06:49.260 align:start position:0%
um I think there's a great deal of of
 
04:06:53.090 --> 04:06:53.100 align:start position:0%
hope that that uh when with the passage
 
04:06:55.610 --> 04:06:55.620 align:start position:0%
of House Bill 315 that initially
 
04:06:58.250 --> 04:06:58.260 align:start position:0%
expanded the net metering program up to
 
04:07:01.010 --> 04:07:01.020 align:start position:0%
five megawatts back in 2021 that there
 
04:07:02.990 --> 04:07:03.000 align:start position:0%
would be a great deal of opportunity for
 
04:07:04.790 --> 04:07:04.800 align:start position:0%
municipal officials to start to lower
 
04:07:07.309 --> 04:07:07.319 align:start position:0%
the energy bills uh that their taxpayers
 
04:07:09.469 --> 04:07:09.479 align:start position:0%
have to have to pay and unfortunately I
 
04:07:10.849 --> 04:07:10.859 align:start position:0%
think what we've seen in the past two
 
04:07:12.769 --> 04:07:12.779 align:start position:0%
years is that a lot of those hopes have
 
04:07:15.229 --> 04:07:15.239 align:start position:0%
been dashed by this very issue that
 
04:07:17.389 --> 04:07:17.399 align:start position:0%
we're that we're considering amending
 
04:07:19.370 --> 04:07:19.380 align:start position:0%
today in in statute
 
04:07:21.830 --> 04:07:21.840 align:start position:0%
um I can tell you that uh
 
04:07:25.490 --> 04:07:25.500 align:start position:0%
I hear from solar developers regularly
 
04:07:28.370 --> 04:07:28.380 align:start position:0%
who are attempting to develop sites and
 
04:07:31.790 --> 04:07:31.800 align:start position:0%
what they find is that not only are they
 
04:07:33.950 --> 04:07:33.960 align:start position:0%
they struggling to find
 
04:07:36.710 --> 04:07:36.720 align:start position:0%
um sites that that are matched with load
 
04:07:38.750 --> 04:07:38.760 align:start position:0%
but also that they're the
 
04:07:40.550 --> 04:07:40.560 align:start position:0%
interconnection costs have been rising
 
04:07:42.710 --> 04:07:42.720 align:start position:0%
dramatically over the past two years and
 
04:07:45.050 --> 04:07:45.060 align:start position:0%
that those are um there's a number of
 
04:07:46.189 --> 04:07:46.199 align:start position:0%
reasons for that they're the
 
04:07:47.689 --> 04:07:47.699 align:start position:0%
inflationary pressures that have been
 
04:07:49.309 --> 04:07:49.319 align:start position:0%
impacting the rest of the economy
 
04:07:52.309 --> 04:07:52.319 align:start position:0%
generally but also uh the the utilities
 
04:07:53.750 --> 04:07:53.760 align:start position:0%
are changing their interconnection
 
04:07:56.150 --> 04:07:56.160 align:start position:0%
requirements and and requiring more
 
04:07:58.670 --> 04:07:58.680 align:start position:0%
infrastructure for for connecting these
 
04:08:00.710 --> 04:08:00.720 align:start position:0%
types of facilities onto the
 
04:08:02.750 --> 04:08:02.760 align:start position:0%
distribution grid and so what that means
 
04:08:04.370 --> 04:08:04.380 align:start position:0%
is that
 
04:08:08.330 --> 04:08:08.340 align:start position:0%
if you have a small town that uh that by
 
04:08:10.130 --> 04:08:10.140 align:start position:0%
itself between its Municipal meters at
 
04:08:11.689 --> 04:08:11.699 align:start position:0%
its wastewater treatment plants and its
 
04:08:13.070 --> 04:08:13.080 align:start position:0%
schools and whatever else is within the
 
04:08:14.570 --> 04:08:14.580 align:start position:0%
boundaries of that Municipal territory
 
04:08:17.689 --> 04:08:17.699 align:start position:0%
has enough load for say a one or two
 
04:08:19.490 --> 04:08:19.500 align:start position:0%
megawatt array
 
04:08:21.590 --> 04:08:21.600 align:start position:0%
um they they start down the road they
 
04:08:23.389 --> 04:08:23.399 align:start position:0%
identify a good site with a developer
 
04:08:26.030 --> 04:08:26.040 align:start position:0%
the developer submits a request for an
 
04:08:27.830 --> 04:08:27.840 align:start position:0%
interconnection study and then they get
 
04:08:29.450 --> 04:08:29.460 align:start position:0%
the price tag for what that study is
 
04:08:31.610 --> 04:08:31.620 align:start position:0%
going to is going to cost and what they
 
04:08:33.410 --> 04:08:33.420 align:start position:0%
realize is they have a project that will
 
04:08:36.410 --> 04:08:36.420 align:start position:0%
not pencil unless they can grow it and
 
04:08:38.870 --> 04:08:38.880 align:start position:0%
and spread those fixed costs of that
 
04:08:41.330 --> 04:08:41.340 align:start position:0%
infrastructure interconnect over more
 
04:08:44.389 --> 04:08:44.399 align:start position:0%
production from from a larger array
 
04:08:46.790 --> 04:08:46.800 align:start position:0%
um and and I think that uh this this
 
04:08:50.210 --> 04:08:50.220 align:start position:0%
bill uh what are the were the uh house
 
04:08:51.889 --> 04:08:51.899 align:start position:0%
and the governor
 
04:08:54.469 --> 04:08:54.479 align:start position:0%
um consider it worthy of Passage and
 
04:08:57.110 --> 04:08:57.120 align:start position:0%
signing would would really unlock the
 
04:08:59.090 --> 04:08:59.100 align:start position:0%
opportunities that that many of these
 
04:09:00.650 --> 04:09:00.660 align:start position:0%
towns were hoping that they would see
 
04:09:03.650 --> 04:09:03.660 align:start position:0%
under house bill 315 from 2021 which was
 
04:09:06.050 --> 04:09:06.060 align:start position:0%
again passed on a bipartisan basis and
 
04:09:07.910 --> 04:09:07.920 align:start position:0%
signed by the governor it would allow
 
04:09:10.670 --> 04:09:10.680 align:start position:0%
smaller towns to to do what some larger
 
04:09:13.070 --> 04:09:13.080 align:start position:0%
communities already have done which is
 
04:09:16.070 --> 04:09:16.080 align:start position:0%
to to achieve that economy of scale that
 
04:09:18.889 --> 04:09:18.899 align:start position:0%
comes when you when you uh take a take a
 
04:09:21.469 --> 04:09:21.479 align:start position:0%
site that already is a good site
 
04:09:25.189 --> 04:09:25.199 align:start position:0%
um but maybe has uh not not enough again
 
04:09:26.570 --> 04:09:26.580 align:start position:0%
not enough
 
04:09:28.729 --> 04:09:28.739 align:start position:0%
not enough scale to really drive down
 
04:09:31.010 --> 04:09:31.020 align:start position:0%
the cost of that kilowatt hour
 
04:09:35.570 --> 04:09:35.580 align:start position:0%
um so uh additionally I'd point out that
 
04:09:37.250 --> 04:09:37.260 align:start position:0%
there are
 
04:09:40.010 --> 04:09:40.020 align:start position:0%
with the passage of House Bill 315 back
 
04:09:44.150 --> 04:09:44.160 align:start position:0%
in 2021 there are at least two dozen
 
04:09:45.710 --> 04:09:45.720 align:start position:0%
um companies that are attempting to
 
04:09:48.349 --> 04:09:48.359 align:start position:0%
develop these projects as we speak many
 
04:09:49.969 --> 04:09:49.979 align:start position:0%
of them have become clean energy New
 
04:09:51.410 --> 04:09:51.420 align:start position:0%
Hampshire members trying to understand
 
04:09:54.290 --> 04:09:54.300 align:start position:0%
the political landscape and and across
 
04:09:56.510 --> 04:09:56.520 align:start position:0%
the board what I've heard is that unless
 
04:09:58.250 --> 04:09:58.260 align:start position:0%
this Municipal boundary issue is sorted
 
04:10:01.969 --> 04:10:01.979 align:start position:0%
out many towns will will likely not be
 
04:10:04.250 --> 04:10:04.260 align:start position:0%
able to develop their resources and and
 
04:10:07.790 --> 04:10:07.800 align:start position:0%
achieve some lower cost energy and can
 
04:10:10.070 --> 04:10:10.080 align:start position:0%
you know the resulting Bill savings that
 
04:10:12.110 --> 04:10:12.120 align:start position:0%
result from that so
 
04:10:13.849 --> 04:10:13.859 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions sort of sort
 
04:10:15.530 --> 04:10:15.540 align:start position:0%
of Meandering testimony there but I was
 
04:10:17.150 --> 04:10:17.160 align:start position:0%
trying to hit on some of the points that
 
04:10:19.070 --> 04:10:19.080 align:start position:0%
I had heard
 
04:10:21.349 --> 04:10:21.359 align:start position:0%
thank you appreciate you being here to
 
04:10:23.450 --> 04:10:23.460 align:start position:0%
talk to US Representative McGee has a
 
04:10:23.460 --> 04:10:25.370 align:start position:0%
talk to US Representative McGee has a
question

04:10:25.370 --> 04:10:25.380 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:10:27.469 --> 04:10:27.479 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and uh thank you
 
04:10:30.530 --> 04:10:30.540 align:start position:0%
Mr Evans Brown for taking my question
 
04:10:30.540 --> 04:10:31.189 align:start position:0%
Mr Evans Brown for taking my question
um

04:10:31.189 --> 04:10:31.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:10:33.110 --> 04:10:33.120 align:start position:0%
when you talk about sort of uptakers
 
04:10:35.090 --> 04:10:35.100 align:start position:0%
that are looking for you know to be to
 
04:10:38.389 --> 04:10:38.399 align:start position:0%
participate I know in my town meeting
 
04:10:42.229 --> 04:10:42.239 align:start position:0%
um we just voted to move forward on
 
04:10:43.910 --> 04:10:43.920 align:start position:0%
looking into Community power so we
 
04:10:46.250 --> 04:10:46.260 align:start position:0%
agreed to at least look at that so I
 
04:10:48.229 --> 04:10:48.239 align:start position:0%
guess my question is you said you had a
 
04:10:50.150 --> 04:10:50.160 align:start position:0%
hundred members of various energy
 
04:10:52.429 --> 04:10:52.439 align:start position:0%
organizations around the State sign on
 
04:10:55.849 --> 04:10:55.859 align:start position:0%
oh what is the input coming into clean
 
04:10:57.830 --> 04:10:57.840 align:start position:0%
energy New Hampshire about how many
 
04:10:59.269 --> 04:10:59.279 align:start position:0%
people are actually looking to lower
 
04:11:01.429 --> 04:11:01.439 align:start position:0%
their costs because that was our
 
04:11:03.410 --> 04:11:03.420 align:start position:0%
motivation in our town meeting everyone
 
04:11:04.910 --> 04:11:04.920 align:start position:0%
is trying to figure out how to lower
 
04:11:06.530 --> 04:11:06.540 align:start position:0%
costs from you people that are running
 
04:11:10.070 --> 04:11:10.080 align:start position:0%
municipalities as well as you know
 
04:11:11.750 --> 04:11:11.760 align:start position:0%
the folks who are voting at the meetings
 
04:11:14.750 --> 04:11:14.760 align:start position:0%
are also saying you know full-throatedly
 
04:11:17.570 --> 04:11:17.580 align:start position:0%
if this will lower our costs
 
04:11:20.330 --> 04:11:20.340 align:start position:0%
yeah it's responsive yeah no that's
 
04:11:22.189 --> 04:11:22.199 align:start position:0%
exactly right I mean I mean universally
 
04:11:24.590 --> 04:11:24.600 align:start position:0%
what we're clean energy New Hampshire be
 
04:11:26.630 --> 04:11:26.640 align:start position:0%
uh we get a lot of these inquiries
 
04:11:27.769 --> 04:11:27.779 align:start position:0%
because people don't necessarily
 
04:11:30.410 --> 04:11:30.420 align:start position:0%
understand what we do so so we we get uh
 
04:11:32.330 --> 04:11:32.340 align:start position:0%
we we become sort of the funnel for a
 
04:11:34.670 --> 04:11:34.680 align:start position:0%
lot of uh these questions and we tend to
 
04:11:36.830 --> 04:11:36.840 align:start position:0%
try to push them off to the the entities
 
04:11:38.450 --> 04:11:38.460 align:start position:0%
that are best suited to serve them but
 
04:11:40.969 --> 04:11:40.979 align:start position:0%
but you're you're not wrong that our our
 
04:11:43.010 --> 04:11:43.020 align:start position:0%
sort of General access inbox has just
 
04:11:45.590 --> 04:11:45.600 align:start position:0%
been flooded with inquiries from from
 
04:11:47.689 --> 04:11:47.699 align:start position:0%
individuals from municipalities from
 
04:11:49.130 --> 04:11:49.140 align:start position:0%
businesses that are all trying to to
 
04:11:51.050 --> 04:11:51.060 align:start position:0%
reduce their energy costs
 
04:11:53.750 --> 04:11:53.760 align:start position:0%
um and and on the municipal front um I
 
04:11:55.670 --> 04:11:55.680 align:start position:0%
know that there are there are dozens of
 
04:11:57.410 --> 04:11:57.420 align:start position:0%
communities that have identified good
 
04:12:00.170 --> 04:12:00.180 align:start position:0%
sites for Community scale uh solar
 
04:12:02.210 --> 04:12:02.220 align:start position:0%
arrays for instance instance
 
04:12:04.130 --> 04:12:04.140 align:start position:0%
um and have have put those out to bid
 
04:12:07.309 --> 04:12:07.319 align:start position:0%
and um and when the numbers come in they
 
04:12:10.610 --> 04:12:10.620 align:start position:0%
find that that you know until until you
 
04:12:12.769 --> 04:12:12.779 align:start position:0%
are able to build a bigger project
 
04:12:15.349 --> 04:12:15.359 align:start position:0%
spread out those fixed costs over more
 
04:12:17.510 --> 04:12:17.520 align:start position:0%
production a lot of these communities
 
04:12:20.269 --> 04:12:20.279 align:start position:0%
scale projects don't pencil under under
 
04:12:25.910 --> 04:12:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:28.389 --> 04:12:28.399 align:start position:0%
what questions for Mr Brown
 
04:12:30.889 --> 04:12:30.899 align:start position:0%
representative Reynolds
 
04:12:34.790 --> 04:12:34.800 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman Sam isn't it
 
04:12:37.729 --> 04:12:37.739 align:start position:0%
best described isn't it true that under
 
04:12:39.290 --> 04:12:39.300 align:start position:0%
current law
 
04:12:42.889 --> 04:12:42.899 align:start position:0%
there is generally speaking an inverse
 
04:12:46.490 --> 04:12:46.500 align:start position:0%
and and a perverse relationship
 
04:12:52.189 --> 04:12:52.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:57.050 --> 04:12:57.060 align:start position:0%
a host of Municipal group metering
 
04:12:59.450 --> 04:12:59.460 align:start position:0%
and all the group members be within the
 
04:12:59.460 --> 04:13:00.170 align:start position:0%
and all the group members be within the
same

04:13:00.170 --> 04:13:00.180 align:start position:0%
same
 
04:13:00.180 --> 04:13:02.269 align:start position:0%
same
municipality

04:13:02.269 --> 04:13:02.279 align:start position:0%
municipality
 
04:13:02.279 --> 04:13:03.950 align:start position:0%
municipality
and

04:13:03.950 --> 04:13:03.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:13:09.170 --> 04:13:09.180 align:start position:0%
the scale of the community the load that
 
04:13:11.210 --> 04:13:11.220 align:start position:0%
is needed to get to
 
04:13:14.570 --> 04:13:14.580 align:start position:0%
the scale of of a
 
04:13:17.389 --> 04:13:17.399 align:start position:0%
of of a facility that is economic is
 
04:13:19.010 --> 04:13:19.020 align:start position:0%
that I mean so I think what you're
 
04:13:21.110 --> 04:13:21.120 align:start position:0%
asking and and maybe maybe you can
 
04:13:23.809 --> 04:13:23.819 align:start position:0%
correct me if I'm off off base here as
 
04:13:26.990 --> 04:13:27.000 align:start position:0%
communities grow their land starts to be
 
04:13:29.030 --> 04:13:29.040 align:start position:0%
taken up but you know suitable land for
 
04:13:30.410 --> 04:13:30.420 align:start position:0%
building a site and starts to be taken
 
04:13:32.929 --> 04:13:32.939 align:start position:0%
up by more and more uses and you have
 
04:13:36.050 --> 04:13:36.060 align:start position:0%
fewer good sites but you've got more
 
04:13:38.030 --> 04:13:38.040 align:start position:0%
more need right so there's a mismatch
 
04:13:40.070 --> 04:13:40.080 align:start position:0%
there's a mismatch between communities
 
04:13:42.110 --> 04:13:42.120 align:start position:0%
that have enough load versus communities
 
04:13:43.849 --> 04:13:43.859 align:start position:0%
that have an abundance of good sites and
 
04:13:46.550 --> 04:13:46.560 align:start position:0%
yes absolutely I think that's the case
 
04:13:48.110 --> 04:13:48.120 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:13:52.790 --> 04:13:52.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:55.309 --> 04:13:55.319 align:start position:0%
seeing none I'll ask a question
 
04:14:00.830 --> 04:14:00.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:03.110 --> 04:14:03.120 align:start position:0%
if if you were here earlier today this
 
04:14:05.330 --> 04:14:05.340 align:start position:0%
morning you heard me mention that over
 
04:14:07.250 --> 04:14:07.260 align:start position:0%
the weekend I was reading the revision
 
04:14:09.410 --> 04:14:09.420 align:start position:0%
energy contract with the county of
 
04:14:11.510 --> 04:14:11.520 align:start position:0%
Rockingham to install a five megawatt
 
04:14:14.990 --> 04:14:15.000 align:start position:0%
solar array at the County Complex that's
 
04:14:16.969 --> 04:14:16.979 align:start position:0%
going to be built over the next two
 
04:14:19.429 --> 04:14:19.439 align:start position:0%
years and the price tag on that array
 
04:14:22.070 --> 04:14:22.080 align:start position:0%
was 10 million dollars
 
04:14:22.080 --> 04:14:24.290 align:start position:0%
was 10 million dollars
and

04:14:24.290 --> 04:14:24.300 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:14:26.389 --> 04:14:26.399 align:start position:0%
according to the contract
 
04:14:29.990 --> 04:14:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:32.689 --> 04:14:32.699 align:start position:0%
how long would it take to for the
 
04:14:34.670 --> 04:14:34.680 align:start position:0%
taxpayers at Rockingham County to
 
04:14:37.910 --> 04:14:37.920 align:start position:0%
realize a return on that investment
 
04:14:39.950 --> 04:14:39.960 align:start position:0%
without having it in front of me I would
 
04:14:43.189 --> 04:14:43.199 align:start position:0%
I would hesitate to uh to to answer that
 
04:14:45.349 --> 04:14:45.359 align:start position:0%
question but what I would say is that
 
04:14:48.950 --> 04:14:48.960 align:start position:0%
The Upfront Capital costs uh are perhaps
 
04:14:50.450 --> 04:14:50.460 align:start position:0%
not the best metric to answer that
 
04:14:52.250 --> 04:14:52.260 align:start position:0%
question the real question is what is
 
04:14:55.070 --> 04:14:55.080 align:start position:0%
the per kilowatt hour or per megawatt
 
04:14:57.530 --> 04:14:57.540 align:start position:0%
hour cost of the electricity that it's
 
04:15:00.050 --> 04:15:00.060 align:start position:0%
going to be generated and and uh and
 
04:15:03.229 --> 04:15:03.239 align:start position:0%
what is the the PPA structure or or the
 
04:15:05.150 --> 04:15:05.160 align:start position:0%
you know the structure through which the
 
04:15:07.309 --> 04:15:07.319 align:start position:0%
Rockingham County Complex is buying that
 
04:15:10.309 --> 04:15:10.319 align:start position:0%
electricity and so uh really the answer
 
04:15:13.309 --> 04:15:13.319 align:start position:0%
to that question is is the elect is the
 
04:15:16.250 --> 04:15:16.260 align:start position:0%
production cost effective and uh you
 
04:15:17.990 --> 04:15:18.000 align:start position:0%
know I'm sure I could try I'm not a math
 
04:15:20.269 --> 04:15:20.279 align:start position:0%
guy I I could try to Crunch the numbers
 
04:15:22.910 --> 04:15:22.920 align:start position:0%
if if I knew the capacity of the array
 
04:15:24.710 --> 04:15:24.720 align:start position:0%
and uh and could make some assumptions
 
04:15:26.389 --> 04:15:26.399 align:start position:0%
about its production to try to guess
 
04:15:28.849 --> 04:15:28.859 align:start position:0%
what the per kilowatt hour number would
 
04:15:31.670 --> 04:15:31.680 align:start position:0%
be but um but that's the real you know
 
04:15:33.769 --> 04:15:33.779 align:start position:0%
electricity is a commodity right it's
 
04:15:36.650 --> 04:15:36.660 align:start position:0%
like it's like ground beef uh and and
 
04:15:38.389 --> 04:15:38.399 align:start position:0%
when you're when you're purchase seeing
 
04:15:39.889 --> 04:15:39.899 align:start position:0%
your ground beef you want to shop with
 
04:15:41.809 --> 04:15:41.819 align:start position:0%
the right number in mind uh with ground
 
04:15:43.429 --> 04:15:43.439 align:start position:0%
beef it's price per pound with
 
04:15:45.110 --> 04:15:45.120 align:start position:0%
electricity as dollars per kilowatt hour
 
04:15:47.929 --> 04:15:47.939 align:start position:0%
so the the capital cost is really
 
04:15:49.130 --> 04:15:49.140 align:start position:0%
um you know it obviously drives that
 
04:15:50.450 --> 04:15:50.460 align:start position:0%
number but it's not the right one to
 
04:15:54.349 --> 04:15:54.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:57.650 --> 04:15:57.660 align:start position:0%
so help me understand this
 
04:15:59.630 --> 04:15:59.640 align:start position:0%
we're going to ignore the capital cost
 
04:16:02.330 --> 04:16:02.340 align:start position:0%
which by my calculations comes out to
 
04:16:05.570 --> 04:16:05.580 align:start position:0%
about a dollar and 69 cents per kilowatt
 
04:16:05.580 --> 04:16:06.530 align:start position:0%
about a dollar and 69 cents per kilowatt
hour

04:16:06.530 --> 04:16:06.540 align:start position:0%
hour
 
04:16:08.450 --> 04:16:08.460 align:start position:0%
uh we're going to ignore that and just
 
04:16:10.250 --> 04:16:10.260 align:start position:0%
for focus on
 
04:16:10.260 --> 04:16:11.750 align:start position:0%
for focus on
the

04:16:11.750 --> 04:16:11.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:16:13.790 --> 04:16:13.800 align:start position:0%
cost of the electricity
 
04:16:17.269 --> 04:16:17.279 align:start position:0%
that would be avoided
 
04:16:19.929 --> 04:16:19.939 align:start position:0%
by taking this
 
04:16:22.610 --> 04:16:22.620 align:start position:0%
arrays electricity and using it within
 
04:16:24.189 --> 04:16:24.199 align:start position:0%
the County Complex is that what you said
 
04:16:28.010 --> 04:16:28.020 align:start position:0%
uh well so I'd want again I want to know
 
04:16:30.410 --> 04:16:30.420 align:start position:0%
actually what the the cost per kilowatt
 
04:16:32.510 --> 04:16:32.520 align:start position:0%
hour that the county is is planning to
 
04:16:34.849 --> 04:16:34.859 align:start position:0%
pay is and I would not I would not base
 
04:16:38.269 --> 04:16:38.279 align:start position:0%
it on on calculations done sitting at a
 
04:16:39.830 --> 04:16:39.840 align:start position:0%
hearing room table I'd want to know what
 
04:16:41.870 --> 04:16:41.880 align:start position:0%
the developer put into their PPA because
 
04:16:44.330 --> 04:16:44.340 align:start position:0%
they're all in structure is going to
 
04:16:45.530 --> 04:16:45.540 align:start position:0%
look a lot different than just
 
04:16:48.290 --> 04:16:48.300 align:start position:0%
multiplying the you know the the our
 
04:16:50.510 --> 04:16:50.520 align:start position:0%
whatever assumptions you baked into on
 
04:16:51.950 --> 04:16:51.960 align:start position:0%
your phone there right so so that
 
04:16:53.809 --> 04:16:53.819 align:start position:0%
includes uh the fact that there are
 
04:16:56.630 --> 04:16:56.640 align:start position:0%
federal tax incentives as well as the
 
04:16:58.370 --> 04:16:58.380 align:start position:0%
ability to sell renewable energy credits
 
04:16:59.630 --> 04:16:59.640 align:start position:0%
both of which could be applied as
 
04:17:02.689 --> 04:17:02.699 align:start position:0%
discounts to the to the PPA that that is
 
04:17:05.030 --> 04:17:05.040 align:start position:0%
signed on to at Rockingham
 
04:17:07.490 --> 04:17:07.500 align:start position:0%
um so so those make a big difference but
 
04:17:11.210 --> 04:17:11.220 align:start position:0%
also uh 16 16 just sounds uh very high
 
04:17:13.070 --> 04:17:13.080 align:start position:0%
for a per kilowatt hour price for a
 
04:17:15.229 --> 04:17:15.239 align:start position:0%
utility scale solar array today you know
 
04:17:16.610 --> 04:17:16.620 align:start position:0%
Maine when they issued their their
 
04:17:18.290 --> 04:17:18.300 align:start position:0%
request for proposals for utility scale
 
04:17:20.330 --> 04:17:20.340 align:start position:0%
solar got numbers as low was three cents
 
04:17:21.950 --> 04:17:21.960 align:start position:0%
per kilowatt hour
 
04:17:21.960 --> 04:17:23.030 align:start position:0%
per kilowatt hour
that

04:17:23.030 --> 04:17:23.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:17:24.950 --> 04:17:24.960 align:start position:0%
excuse me that included the capital cost
 
04:17:26.870 --> 04:17:26.880 align:start position:0%
yes yeah
 
04:17:26.880 --> 04:17:28.189 align:start position:0%
yes yeah
interesting

04:17:28.189 --> 04:17:28.199 align:start position:0%
interesting
 
04:17:30.229 --> 04:17:30.239 align:start position:0%
well we haven't seen the PPA yet all
 
04:17:32.689 --> 04:17:32.699 align:start position:0%
we've seen is the contract to build the
 
04:17:32.699 --> 04:17:34.250 align:start position:0%
we've seen is the contract to build the
array

04:17:34.250 --> 04:17:34.260 align:start position:0%
array
 
04:17:34.260 --> 04:17:35.030 align:start position:0%
array
um

04:17:35.030 --> 04:17:35.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:17:37.490 --> 04:17:37.500 align:start position:0%
the county is paying for it so the
 
04:17:40.550 --> 04:17:40.560 align:start position:0%
county will own it once it's built
 
04:17:42.710 --> 04:17:42.720 align:start position:0%
which probably is an advantage to the
 
04:17:44.809 --> 04:17:44.819 align:start position:0%
county I was going to say if you own it
 
04:17:46.250 --> 04:17:46.260 align:start position:0%
that's the that's the best way to
 
04:17:48.229 --> 04:17:48.239 align:start position:0%
capture all the benefits is to own the
 
04:17:50.269 --> 04:17:50.279 align:start position:0%
own the facility yourself okay questions
 
04:17:51.950 --> 04:17:51.960 align:start position:0%
on the financing cost at that point as I
 
04:17:53.750 --> 04:17:53.760 align:start position:0%
learned more about the terms of the PPA
 
04:17:56.570 --> 04:17:56.580 align:start position:0%
when they become available we'll uh
 
04:17:58.969 --> 04:17:58.979 align:start position:0%
we'll have further discussions on this
 
04:18:00.710 --> 04:18:00.720 align:start position:0%
so thank you
 
04:18:03.110 --> 04:18:03.120 align:start position:0%
any further questions for the museum
 
04:18:05.389 --> 04:18:05.399 align:start position:0%
Evans Brown of clean energy New
 
04:18:08.150 --> 04:18:08.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire seeing none I'll thank you and
 
04:18:10.189 --> 04:18:10.199 align:start position:0%
we'll move along here
 
04:18:13.429 --> 04:18:13.439 align:start position:0%
next I'll call on Joellen Courtney of
 
04:18:20.450 --> 04:18:20.460 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:23.330 --> 04:18:23.340 align:start position:0%
welcome Ms Courtney
 
04:18:24.889 --> 04:18:24.899 align:start position:0%
thanks for making the long trip over
 
04:18:28.189 --> 04:18:28.199 align:start position:0%
from Enfield sure my name is Joellen
 
04:18:30.170 --> 04:18:30.180 align:start position:0%
Courtney and I'm chair of the Enfield
 
04:18:31.849 --> 04:18:31.859 align:start position:0%
energy committee
 
04:18:34.610 --> 04:18:34.620 align:start position:0%
and I would like to
 
04:18:38.030 --> 04:18:38.040 align:start position:0%
encourage you to support this bill and
 
04:18:40.070 --> 04:18:40.080 align:start position:0%
it would benefit the Mascoma Valley
 
04:18:42.950 --> 04:18:42.960 align:start position:0%
Regional School District which is
 
04:18:44.330 --> 04:18:44.340 align:start position:0%
comprised of
 
04:18:48.229 --> 04:18:48.239 align:start position:0%
Canaan Enfield Grafton Dorchester and
 
04:18:48.239 --> 04:18:49.610 align:start position:0%
Canaan Enfield Grafton Dorchester and
orange

04:18:49.610 --> 04:18:49.620 align:start position:0%
orange
 
04:18:51.590 --> 04:18:51.600 align:start position:0%
very small communities
 
04:18:54.710 --> 04:18:54.720 align:start position:0%
and so this Regional School District
 
04:18:59.990 --> 04:19:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:02.689 --> 04:19:02.699 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much are there any
 
04:19:04.550 --> 04:19:04.560 align:start position:0%
questions for Miss Courtney
 
04:19:07.070 --> 04:19:07.080 align:start position:0%
representative Corman who I think lives
 
04:19:09.349 --> 04:19:09.359 align:start position:0%
in that area has a question thank you Mr
 
04:19:10.910 --> 04:19:10.920 align:start position:0%
chairman yes Ms Courtney I live in
 
04:19:14.210 --> 04:19:14.220 align:start position:0%
Lebanon I frequently bicycle into
 
04:19:16.429 --> 04:19:16.439 align:start position:0%
Enfield in Canaan and I go right by the
 
04:19:19.189 --> 04:19:19.199 align:start position:0%
high school on the rail trail so I'm
 
04:19:20.570 --> 04:19:20.580 align:start position:0%
just wondering can you elaborate a
 
04:19:21.830 --> 04:19:21.840 align:start position:0%
little bit more on how this would
 
04:19:23.990 --> 04:19:24.000 align:start position:0%
benefit the the district
 
04:19:26.269 --> 04:19:26.279 align:start position:0%
I see potential for the future I don't
 
04:19:28.790 --> 04:19:28.800 align:start position:0%
see that there's anything on the books
 
04:19:30.110 --> 04:19:30.120 align:start position:0%
right now
 
04:19:30.120 --> 04:19:30.710 align:start position:0%
right now
um

04:19:30.710 --> 04:19:30.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:19:34.370 --> 04:19:34.380 align:start position:0%
but looking forward I see that that
 
04:19:38.170 --> 04:19:38.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:40.610 --> 04:19:40.620 align:start position:0%
Dorchester and orange there's a lot of
 
04:19:42.650 --> 04:19:42.660 align:start position:0%
open space there and there's be
 
04:19:47.950 --> 04:19:47.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:50.210 --> 04:19:50.220 align:start position:0%
you know
 
04:19:53.030 --> 04:19:53.040 align:start position:0%
representative closure has a question
 
04:19:55.130 --> 04:19:55.140 align:start position:0%
thank you chair thank you Miss Courtney
 
04:19:57.410 --> 04:19:57.420 align:start position:0%
as a former residence of Grafton and
 
04:19:59.030 --> 04:19:59.040 align:start position:0%
Grafton County
 
04:20:02.570 --> 04:20:02.580 align:start position:0%
um did you look at our low-income
 
04:20:05.510 --> 04:20:05.520 align:start position:0%
families out there in you know where
 
04:20:07.849 --> 04:20:07.859 align:start position:0%
they are is this going to have a
 
04:20:10.130 --> 04:20:10.140 align:start position:0%
positive effect for those Property
 
04:20:13.370 --> 04:20:13.380 align:start position:0%
Owners thank you I would expect so sir
 
04:20:15.349 --> 04:20:15.359 align:start position:0%
um again there's nothing on the books
 
04:20:17.330 --> 04:20:17.340 align:start position:0%
there's nothing planned but I just see
 
04:20:19.670 --> 04:20:19.680 align:start position:0%
this as a potential and that's why I
 
04:20:21.229 --> 04:20:21.239 align:start position:0%
would really encourage you to vote for
 
04:20:21.239 --> 04:20:26.110 align:start position:0%
would really encourage you to vote for
it

04:20:26.110 --> 04:20:26.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:30.469 --> 04:20:30.479 align:start position:0%
any additional questions for Ms Courtney
 
04:20:32.389 --> 04:20:32.399 align:start position:0%
see none I want to thank you for being
 
04:20:32.399 --> 04:20:33.229 align:start position:0%
see none I want to thank you for being
here

04:20:33.229 --> 04:20:33.239 align:start position:0%
here
 
04:20:36.349 --> 04:20:36.359 align:start position:0%
thanks for making the long drive
 
04:20:39.590 --> 04:20:39.600 align:start position:0%
next we'll call on Charles George of
 
04:20:50.229 --> 04:20:50.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:52.610 --> 04:20:52.620 align:start position:0%
please turn on your mic
 
04:20:54.769 --> 04:20:54.779 align:start position:0%
the button down below thank you thank
 
04:20:56.929 --> 04:20:56.939 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman and representatives on
 
04:20:58.490 --> 04:20:58.500 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
04:21:01.490 --> 04:21:01.500 align:start position:0%
um I'm a lifelong resident of New
 
04:21:04.670 --> 04:21:04.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire 40 years in Rollinsford
 
04:21:08.689 --> 04:21:08.699 align:start position:0%
a former business owner retired now
 
04:21:12.170 --> 04:21:12.180 align:start position:0%
and uh just started to take an interest
 
04:21:14.150 --> 04:21:14.160 align:start position:0%
in uh
 
04:21:14.160 --> 04:21:15.530 align:start position:0%
in uh
local

04:21:15.530 --> 04:21:15.540 align:start position:0%
local
 
04:21:18.830 --> 04:21:18.840 align:start position:0%
government a few years ago I'm on the
 
04:21:21.889 --> 04:21:21.899 align:start position:0%
budget Committee in Rollinsford
 
04:21:25.370 --> 04:21:25.380 align:start position:0%
and I have seen the small small town
 
04:21:27.590 --> 04:21:27.600 align:start position:0%
works and operation
 
04:21:32.030 --> 04:21:32.040 align:start position:0%
and this bill I really feel would
 
04:21:33.650 --> 04:21:33.660 align:start position:0%
help us
 
04:21:36.969 --> 04:21:36.979 align:start position:0%
in the small communities
 
04:21:40.750 --> 04:21:40.760 align:start position:0%
lower our energy costs
 
04:21:43.790 --> 04:21:43.800 align:start position:0%
it seems that this year we've seen a
 
04:21:46.550 --> 04:21:46.560 align:start position:0%
tremendous jump like everyone has and
 
04:21:49.429 --> 04:21:49.439 align:start position:0%
going forward it's really difficult to
 
04:21:49.439 --> 04:21:50.830 align:start position:0%
going forward it's really difficult to
estimate

04:21:50.830 --> 04:21:50.840 align:start position:0%
estimate
 
04:21:52.849 --> 04:21:52.859 align:start position:0%
how long
 
04:21:54.889 --> 04:21:54.899 align:start position:0%
we're going to be climbing with energy
 
04:21:54.899 --> 04:21:56.269 align:start position:0%
we're going to be climbing with energy
costs

04:21:56.269 --> 04:21:56.279 align:start position:0%
costs
 
04:22:00.250 --> 04:22:00.260 align:start position:0%
we in Rollins for just this past fall
 
04:22:03.969 --> 04:22:03.979 align:start position:0%
actually through the budget committee
 
04:22:06.710 --> 04:22:06.720 align:start position:0%
petitioned the select board
 
04:22:06.720 --> 04:22:08.269 align:start position:0%
petitioned the select board
to

04:22:08.269 --> 04:22:08.279 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:22:10.670 --> 04:22:10.680 align:start position:0%
make a energy commission to look at
 
04:22:10.680 --> 04:22:13.250 align:start position:0%
make a energy commission to look at
energy

04:22:13.250 --> 04:22:13.260 align:start position:0%
energy
 
04:22:16.969 --> 04:22:16.979 align:start position:0%
usage in town and ways to conserve and
 
04:22:20.570 --> 04:22:20.580 align:start position:0%
improve our position with energy
 
04:22:22.429 --> 04:22:22.439 align:start position:0%
in fact
 
04:22:24.590 --> 04:22:24.600 align:start position:0%
the Rollinsford energy commission is
 
04:22:26.630 --> 04:22:26.640 align:start position:0%
mostly made up of budget committee
 
04:22:28.910 --> 04:22:28.920 align:start position:0%
members who are all interested in
 
04:22:32.990 --> 04:22:33.000 align:start position:0%
capping or lowering this cost
 
04:22:33.000 --> 04:22:34.189 align:start position:0%
capping or lowering this cost
um

04:22:34.189 --> 04:22:34.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:22:38.030 --> 04:22:38.040 align:start position:0%
we're newcomers to the solar idea
 
04:22:39.950 --> 04:22:39.960 align:start position:0%
although personally I have some
 
04:22:42.710 --> 04:22:42.720 align:start position:0%
experience I put solar panels on my
 
04:22:42.720 --> 04:22:44.030 align:start position:0%
experience I put solar panels on my
business

04:22:44.030 --> 04:22:44.040 align:start position:0%
business
 
04:22:47.450 --> 04:22:47.460 align:start position:0%
and I have solar panels on my home and I
 
04:22:47.460 --> 04:22:48.429 align:start position:0%
and I have solar panels on my home and I
found

04:22:48.429 --> 04:22:48.439 align:start position:0%
found
 
04:22:51.950 --> 04:22:51.960 align:start position:0%
investment to be very worthwhile
 
04:22:53.570 --> 04:22:53.580 align:start position:0%
and I thought
 
04:22:56.510 --> 04:22:56.520 align:start position:0%
if there's a way for the municipality to
 
04:22:58.189 --> 04:22:58.199 align:start position:0%
be able to take advantage of some of
 
04:22:59.870 --> 04:22:59.880 align:start position:0%
these benefits
 
04:23:04.010 --> 04:23:04.020 align:start position:0%
and help the taxpayers and keep our tax
 
04:23:04.020 --> 04:23:05.889 align:start position:0%
and help the taxpayers and keep our tax
base

04:23:05.889 --> 04:23:05.899 align:start position:0%
base
 
04:23:09.410 --> 04:23:09.420 align:start position:0%
costs down this would be
 
04:23:13.010 --> 04:23:13.020 align:start position:0%
a project we want to get behind and we
 
04:23:14.809 --> 04:23:14.819 align:start position:0%
did some
 
04:23:17.990 --> 04:23:18.000 align:start position:0%
research in the area and we do have the
 
04:23:21.349 --> 04:23:21.359 align:start position:0%
resource and attractive land that
 
04:23:23.870 --> 04:23:23.880 align:start position:0%
we think would be a good
 
04:23:28.429 --> 04:23:28.439 align:start position:0%
location for a solar field it's close to
 
04:23:30.710 --> 04:23:30.720 align:start position:0%
transmission power lines it's pretty
 
04:23:32.510 --> 04:23:32.520 align:start position:0%
much undevelopable
 
04:23:34.550 --> 04:23:34.560 align:start position:0%
in any other respect
 
04:23:38.030 --> 04:23:38.040 align:start position:0%
and um as we looked into it we were
 
04:23:40.790 --> 04:23:40.800 align:start position:0%
discouraged by the fact that we would
 
04:23:42.650 --> 04:23:42.660 align:start position:0%
have to have
 
04:23:45.170 --> 04:23:45.180 align:start position:0%
something in the scale of five megawatts
 
04:23:48.410 --> 04:23:48.420 align:start position:0%
for it to be economically feasible and
 
04:23:49.309 --> 04:23:49.319 align:start position:0%
that was
 
04:23:49.319 --> 04:23:49.849 align:start position:0%
that was
um

04:23:49.849 --> 04:23:49.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:23:52.689 --> 04:23:52.699 align:start position:0%
a cost prohibitive
 
04:23:55.790 --> 04:23:55.800 align:start position:0%
ceiling for us with the limited usage
 
04:23:58.490 --> 04:23:58.500 align:start position:0%
for the town I mean we have our schools
 
04:24:00.950 --> 04:24:00.960 align:start position:0%
we have our municipal buildings
 
04:24:03.469 --> 04:24:03.479 align:start position:0%
the sewer and water treatment plant
 
04:24:06.469 --> 04:24:06.479 align:start position:0%
but we couldn't justify
 
04:24:10.969 --> 04:24:10.979 align:start position:0%
a solar field of that magnitude alone
 
04:24:14.809 --> 04:24:14.819 align:start position:0%
this bill would enable us to Parlay our
 
04:24:17.389 --> 04:24:17.399 align:start position:0%
resource with other communities
 
04:24:21.469 --> 04:24:21.479 align:start position:0%
and take advantage of clean energy
 
04:24:25.550 --> 04:24:25.560 align:start position:0%
reduce the cost for taxpayers and
 
04:24:28.250 --> 04:24:28.260 align:start position:0%
um and that's the reason why we're here
 
04:24:30.769 --> 04:24:30.779 align:start position:0%
three of us from Rollinsford
 
04:24:32.870 --> 04:24:32.880 align:start position:0%
to make sure that the legislature knows
 
04:24:35.710 --> 04:24:35.720 align:start position:0%
that the small communities need a break
 
04:24:40.550 --> 04:24:40.560 align:start position:0%
in order to crack this energy nut I
 
04:24:42.889 --> 04:24:42.899 align:start position:0%
don't think it's a Panacea
 
04:24:46.370 --> 04:24:46.380 align:start position:0%
for all of our problems but we must take
 
04:24:48.950 --> 04:24:48.960 align:start position:0%
advantage of every opportunity and and
 
04:24:50.630 --> 04:24:50.640 align:start position:0%
it seems to me that New Hampshire has
 
04:24:52.969 --> 04:24:52.979 align:start position:0%
been dragging their feet in
 
04:24:52.979 --> 04:24:55.510 align:start position:0%
been dragging their feet in
incentivizing

04:24:55.510 --> 04:24:55.520 align:start position:0%
incentivizing
 
04:24:57.710 --> 04:24:57.720 align:start position:0%
smaller communities
 
04:24:57.720 --> 04:24:59.809 align:start position:0%
smaller communities
from

04:24:59.809 --> 04:24:59.819 align:start position:0%
from
 
04:25:02.689 --> 04:25:02.699 align:start position:0%
um from the process of solving our
 
04:25:06.769 --> 04:25:06.779 align:start position:0%
energy crunch so I'd encourage
 
04:25:08.570 --> 04:25:08.580 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
04:25:11.510 --> 04:25:11.520 align:start position:0%
um and the house to support this bill
 
04:25:13.910 --> 04:25:13.920 align:start position:0%
and give
 
04:25:16.790 --> 04:25:16.800 align:start position:0%
our small communities a voice and an
 
04:25:19.309 --> 04:25:19.319 align:start position:0%
opportunity in solving our energy
 
04:25:19.319 --> 04:25:22.010 align:start position:0%
opportunity in solving our energy
problems

04:25:22.010 --> 04:25:22.020 align:start position:0%
problems
 
04:25:22.020 --> 04:25:24.410 align:start position:0%
problems
um

04:25:24.410 --> 04:25:24.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:27.830 --> 04:25:27.840 align:start position:0%
I appreciate the time that I had to come
 
04:25:30.170 --> 04:25:30.180 align:start position:0%
before you unaccustomed as I am I'm
 
04:25:33.410 --> 04:25:33.420 align:start position:0%
showing up for hearings I've learned a
 
04:25:36.650 --> 04:25:36.660 align:start position:0%
lot and I have a lot of Hope and Faith
 
04:25:39.590 --> 04:25:39.600 align:start position:0%
that the house will understand the
 
04:25:41.929 --> 04:25:41.939 align:start position:0%
plight of the small communities that
 
04:25:45.530 --> 04:25:45.540 align:start position:0%
want to keep taxpayers happy and
 
04:25:49.550 --> 04:25:49.560 align:start position:0%
taxpayers in town and
 
04:25:53.750 --> 04:25:53.760 align:start position:0%
and this this bill I think
 
04:25:56.450 --> 04:25:56.460 align:start position:0%
isn't a Panacea but it will certainly
 
04:25:56.460 --> 04:25:58.550 align:start position:0%
isn't a Panacea but it will certainly
help

04:25:58.550 --> 04:25:58.560 align:start position:0%
help
 
04:25:58.560 --> 04:26:00.349 align:start position:0%
help
muster

04:26:00.349 --> 04:26:00.359 align:start position:0%
muster
 
04:26:03.170 --> 04:26:03.180 align:start position:0%
community relations we've already had
 
04:26:05.510 --> 04:26:05.520 align:start position:0%
some conversations with uh
 
04:26:08.809 --> 04:26:08.819 align:start position:0%
other communities and we're expecting to
 
04:26:10.729 --> 04:26:10.739 align:start position:0%
be able to um
 
04:26:13.510 --> 04:26:13.520 align:start position:0%
see what comes out of Concord
 
04:26:17.149 --> 04:26:17.159 align:start position:0%
for encouragement so please make it
 
04:26:20.450 --> 04:26:20.460 align:start position:0%
happen for us thank you for your time
 
04:26:22.849 --> 04:26:22.859 align:start position:0%
thank you well we appreciate you being
 
04:26:25.370 --> 04:26:25.380 align:start position:0%
here because you're giving us the
 
04:26:27.110 --> 04:26:27.120 align:start position:0%
opportunity to
 
04:26:31.490 --> 04:26:31.500 align:start position:0%
learn from you and your experiences
 
04:26:33.710 --> 04:26:33.720 align:start position:0%
now you said earlier that you had bought
 
04:26:35.929 --> 04:26:35.939 align:start position:0%
a solar system for your business and
 
04:26:37.969 --> 04:26:37.979 align:start position:0%
also one for your home is that true
 
04:26:41.870 --> 04:26:41.880 align:start position:0%
that's correct that's correct I put uh
 
04:26:44.809 --> 04:26:44.819 align:start position:0%
solar panels on my business
 
04:26:44.819 --> 04:26:47.210 align:start position:0%
solar panels on my business
um

04:26:47.210 --> 04:26:47.220 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:49.969 --> 04:26:49.979 align:start position:0%
seven years ago
 
04:26:53.389 --> 04:26:53.399 align:start position:0%
um maybe closer to eight now
 
04:26:53.399 --> 04:26:54.469 align:start position:0%
um maybe closer to eight now
um

04:26:54.469 --> 04:26:54.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:26:58.010 --> 04:26:58.020 align:start position:0%
the system paid for itself in less than
 
04:27:00.050 --> 04:27:00.060 align:start position:0%
four years
 
04:27:02.870 --> 04:27:02.880 align:start position:0%
and currently
 
04:27:04.910 --> 04:27:04.920 align:start position:0%
the state benefits
 
04:27:04.920 --> 04:27:06.530 align:start position:0%
the state benefits
from

04:27:06.530 --> 04:27:06.540 align:start position:0%
from
 
04:27:06.540 --> 04:27:07.429 align:start position:0%
from
um

04:27:07.429 --> 04:27:07.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:27:07.439 --> 04:27:09.710 align:start position:0%
um
my

04:27:09.710 --> 04:27:09.720 align:start position:0%
my
 
04:27:12.590 --> 04:27:12.600 align:start position:0%
project in that uh
 
04:27:16.189 --> 04:27:16.199 align:start position:0%
I leased this the space to the state and
 
04:27:19.010 --> 04:27:19.020 align:start position:0%
they have a reduced Energy bill as a
 
04:27:20.750 --> 04:27:20.760 align:start position:0%
result of those panels that are on the
 
04:27:20.760 --> 04:27:21.769 align:start position:0%
result of those panels that are on the
building

04:27:21.769 --> 04:27:21.779 align:start position:0%
building
 
04:27:25.250 --> 04:27:25.260 align:start position:0%
I've retired I developed my building
 
04:27:28.910 --> 04:27:28.920 align:start position:0%
and the Tenant gets the benefit
 
04:27:31.670 --> 04:27:31.680 align:start position:0%
of the electrical savings now on on that
 
04:27:33.830 --> 04:27:33.840 align:start position:0%
building and it's uh it's a small system
 
04:27:36.050 --> 04:27:36.060 align:start position:0%
it's uh
 
04:27:39.229 --> 04:27:39.239 align:start position:0%
um 55 megawatt system which is
 
04:27:41.030 --> 04:27:41.040 align:start position:0%
considered a small system in the scale
 
04:27:41.040 --> 04:27:41.750 align:start position:0%
considered a small system in the scale
of

04:27:41.750 --> 04:27:41.760 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:27:43.929 --> 04:27:43.939 align:start position:0%
the systems you're talking about here
 
04:27:47.450 --> 04:27:47.460 align:start position:0%
but it it definitely makes a huge dent
 
04:27:50.269 --> 04:27:50.279 align:start position:0%
in the utility bill it did for me as a
 
04:27:53.210 --> 04:27:53.220 align:start position:0%
business owner and I actually
 
04:27:53.220 --> 04:27:54.130 align:start position:0%
business owner and I actually
um

04:27:54.130 --> 04:27:54.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:27:58.309 --> 04:27:58.319 align:start position:0%
used less energy than I produced
 
04:28:00.170 --> 04:28:00.180 align:start position:0%
and um
 
04:28:02.330 --> 04:28:02.340 align:start position:0%
I was entitled to
 
04:28:04.849 --> 04:28:04.859 align:start position:0%
sell the energy back to the
 
04:28:09.410 --> 04:28:09.420 align:start position:0%
to eversource and of course
 
04:28:11.510 --> 04:28:11.520 align:start position:0%
that's a losing proposition because they
 
04:28:13.429 --> 04:28:13.439 align:start position:0%
pay you a wholesale
 
04:28:17.110 --> 04:28:17.120 align:start position:0%
figure versus uh what you're paying but
 
04:28:20.269 --> 04:28:20.279 align:start position:0%
I understood that I was able and this is
 
04:28:22.130 --> 04:28:22.140 align:start position:0%
what I don't understand about our law
 
04:28:24.710 --> 04:28:24.720 align:start position:0%
right now I understood I was able
 
04:28:28.809 --> 04:28:28.819 align:start position:0%
to make a a net metering group
 
04:28:33.250 --> 04:28:33.260 align:start position:0%
and sell that energy to customers
 
04:28:35.689 --> 04:28:35.699 align:start position:0%
that was excess
 
04:28:39.950 --> 04:28:39.960 align:start position:0%
I never followed up on that Prospect but
 
04:28:42.590 --> 04:28:42.600 align:start position:0%
I don't understand why
 
04:28:44.570 --> 04:28:44.580 align:start position:0%
small communities shouldn't be able to
 
04:28:46.250 --> 04:28:46.260 align:start position:0%
do the same thing
 
04:28:49.010 --> 04:28:49.020 align:start position:0%
and I know there's a lot more to the
 
04:28:51.349 --> 04:28:51.359 align:start position:0%
workings than I understand I I overheard
 
04:28:53.929 --> 04:28:53.939 align:start position:0%
the department of Energy's concerns
 
04:28:57.290 --> 04:28:57.300 align:start position:0%
about this bill I don't understand
 
04:28:57.300 --> 04:28:58.189 align:start position:0%
about this bill I don't understand
um

04:28:58.189 --> 04:28:58.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:29:00.830 --> 04:29:00.840 align:start position:0%
the politics behind it but the common
 
04:29:04.969 --> 04:29:04.979 align:start position:0%
sense behind it is definitely there
 
04:29:07.189 --> 04:29:07.199 align:start position:0%
from my experience
 
04:29:09.410 --> 04:29:09.420 align:start position:0%
so you said that
 
04:29:09.420 --> 04:29:10.550 align:start position:0%
so you said that
uh

04:29:10.550 --> 04:29:10.560 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:29:12.469 --> 04:29:12.479 align:start position:0%
the system that you installed on your
 
04:29:14.769 --> 04:29:14.779 align:start position:0%
business and your house or your home
 
04:29:18.530 --> 04:29:18.540 align:start position:0%
saved you a lot of money yes
 
04:29:21.410 --> 04:29:21.420 align:start position:0%
but then you also said that when your
 
04:29:24.530 --> 04:29:24.540 align:start position:0%
energy committee looked at uh
 
04:29:27.410 --> 04:29:27.420 align:start position:0%
a town solar system of five megawatts it
 
04:29:30.110 --> 04:29:30.120 align:start position:0%
was not
 
04:29:32.689 --> 04:29:32.699 align:start position:0%
well financially or economically
 
04:29:32.699 --> 04:29:34.370 align:start position:0%
well financially or economically
feasible

04:29:34.370 --> 04:29:34.380 align:start position:0%
feasible
 
04:29:37.610 --> 04:29:37.620 align:start position:0%
so my question would be if it was
 
04:29:39.410 --> 04:29:39.420 align:start position:0%
feasible for your in your business and
 
04:29:40.849 --> 04:29:40.859 align:start position:0%
for you personally
 
04:29:43.370 --> 04:29:43.380 align:start position:0%
why can't you find a put together a
 
04:29:45.170 --> 04:29:45.180 align:start position:0%
system that's feasible economically for
 
04:29:46.969 --> 04:29:46.979 align:start position:0%
the town if it saves the town lots of
 
04:29:46.979 --> 04:29:48.349 align:start position:0%
the town if it saves the town lots of
money

04:29:48.349 --> 04:29:48.359 align:start position:0%
money
 
04:29:51.469 --> 04:29:51.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:55.130 --> 04:29:55.140 align:start position:0%
with this bill okay we can
 
04:29:58.309 --> 04:29:58.319 align:start position:0%
team up with other communities
 
04:30:01.550 --> 04:30:01.560 align:start position:0%
and meet the five megawatt which is this
 
04:30:04.670 --> 04:30:04.680 align:start position:0%
you know three to five is The Sweet Spot
 
04:30:07.670 --> 04:30:07.680 align:start position:0%
for it on a much smaller scale
 
04:30:10.570 --> 04:30:10.580 align:start position:0%
I don't think it would be
 
04:30:13.070 --> 04:30:13.080 align:start position:0%
economically feasible
 
04:30:15.649 --> 04:30:15.659 align:start position:0%
to build a solar field to just
 
04:30:15.659 --> 04:30:16.849 align:start position:0%
to build a solar field to just
accommodate

04:30:16.849 --> 04:30:16.859 align:start position:0%
accommodate
 
04:30:20.870 --> 04:30:20.880 align:start position:0%
what energy Rollinsford uses alone
 
04:30:24.130 --> 04:30:24.140 align:start position:0%
but if we were able to Parlay
 
04:30:27.229 --> 04:30:27.239 align:start position:0%
economically feasible size lot a
 
04:30:29.450 --> 04:30:29.460 align:start position:0%
feasible size solar field with other
 
04:30:29.460 --> 04:30:31.010 align:start position:0%
feasible size solar field with other
communities

04:30:31.010 --> 04:30:31.020 align:start position:0%
communities
 
04:30:33.050 --> 04:30:33.060 align:start position:0%
we would reap the benefit they would
 
04:30:35.510 --> 04:30:35.520 align:start position:0%
reap the benefit and we would be able to
 
04:30:38.330 --> 04:30:38.340 align:start position:0%
lower our energy costs
 
04:30:42.290 --> 04:30:42.300 align:start position:0%
through a group effort and that's the
 
04:30:46.189 --> 04:30:46.199 align:start position:0%
big thing sure we could apply for a
 
04:30:49.610 --> 04:30:49.620 align:start position:0%
solar array for town hall or the school
 
04:30:51.649 --> 04:30:51.659 align:start position:0%
or whatever else have you
 
04:30:54.410 --> 04:30:54.420 align:start position:0%
and that
 
04:30:57.410 --> 04:30:57.420 align:start position:0%
in it in and of itself represents a cost
 
04:30:59.929 --> 04:30:59.939 align:start position:0%
that you know we would have to try to
 
04:30:59.939 --> 04:31:01.130 align:start position:0%
that you know we would have to try to
reclaim

04:31:01.130 --> 04:31:01.140 align:start position:0%
reclaim
 
04:31:04.010 --> 04:31:04.020 align:start position:0%
on an individual basis with uh all of
 
04:31:05.689 --> 04:31:05.699 align:start position:0%
the other complexities that go along
 
04:31:08.689 --> 04:31:08.699 align:start position:0%
with it but by having one project that
 
04:31:13.790 --> 04:31:13.800 align:start position:0%
we could further fan out and uh find
 
04:31:16.370 --> 04:31:16.380 align:start position:0%
enough uh demand
 
04:31:20.750 --> 04:31:20.760 align:start position:0%
for and spread the cost out we feel we
 
04:31:20.760 --> 04:31:21.710 align:start position:0%
for and spread the cost out we feel we
could

04:31:21.710 --> 04:31:21.720 align:start position:0%
could
 
04:31:23.929 --> 04:31:23.939 align:start position:0%
save the taxpayers money
 
04:31:27.590 --> 04:31:27.600 align:start position:0%
and make it feasible and you know
 
04:31:29.450 --> 04:31:29.460 align:start position:0%
that's all we're asking for is that
 
04:31:31.610 --> 04:31:31.620 align:start position:0%
you'll look at a way to to make us get
 
04:31:34.070 --> 04:31:34.080 align:start position:0%
beyond the town of Rollins in order to
 
04:31:37.250 --> 04:31:37.260 align:start position:0%
be able to take advantage of
 
04:31:40.070 --> 04:31:40.080 align:start position:0%
some of the incentives that are out
 
04:31:40.080 --> 04:31:41.630 align:start position:0%
some of the incentives that are out
there

04:31:41.630 --> 04:31:41.640 align:start position:0%
there
 
04:31:43.969 --> 04:31:43.979 align:start position:0%
so what evidence did your town energy
 
04:31:47.750 --> 04:31:47.760 align:start position:0%
committee find that this so-called three
 
04:31:51.769 --> 04:31:51.779 align:start position:0%
to five megawatts Sweet Spot exists and
 
04:31:55.849 --> 04:31:55.859 align:start position:0%
it did that what kind of cost reductions
 
04:32:02.149 --> 04:32:02.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:05.030 --> 04:32:05.040 align:start position:0%
we haven't done enough research on what
 
04:32:08.030 --> 04:32:08.040 align:start position:0%
that size was because that was Out Of
 
04:32:08.040 --> 04:32:09.170 align:start position:0%
that size was because that was Out Of
Reach

04:32:09.170 --> 04:32:09.180 align:start position:0%
Reach
 
04:32:12.110 --> 04:32:12.120 align:start position:0%
with the current legislation when we
 
04:32:14.929 --> 04:32:14.939 align:start position:0%
first were formed we're still trying
 
04:32:17.090 --> 04:32:17.100 align:start position:0%
we're still learning and trying to find
 
04:32:17.100 --> 04:32:18.410 align:start position:0%
we're still learning and trying to find
out

04:32:18.410 --> 04:32:18.420 align:start position:0%
out
 
04:32:21.590 --> 04:32:21.600 align:start position:0%
what we could actually end up saving but
 
04:32:23.450 --> 04:32:23.460 align:start position:0%
if it's any comparison to what I've
 
04:32:25.849 --> 04:32:25.859 align:start position:0%
found from my experience
 
04:32:27.649 --> 04:32:27.659 align:start position:0%
I pay
 
04:32:27.659 --> 04:32:28.550 align:start position:0%
I pay
um

04:32:28.550 --> 04:32:28.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:32:30.950 --> 04:32:30.960 align:start position:0%
very little
 
04:32:30.960 --> 04:32:32.750 align:start position:0%
very little
um

04:32:32.750 --> 04:32:32.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:32:35.030 --> 04:32:35.040 align:start position:0%
back to eversource
 
04:32:36.950 --> 04:32:36.960 align:start position:0%
on my home
 
04:32:40.389 --> 04:32:40.399 align:start position:0%
because I have solar panels
 
04:32:43.309 --> 04:32:43.319 align:start position:0%
I virtually have just the transmission
 
04:32:47.990 --> 04:32:48.000 align:start position:0%
costs most months other than
 
04:32:50.689 --> 04:32:50.699 align:start position:0%
I would say December and January I think
 
04:32:53.030 --> 04:32:53.040 align:start position:0%
that the same kind of savings could be
 
04:32:55.910 --> 04:32:55.920 align:start position:0%
passed on to taxpayers
 
04:33:00.170 --> 04:33:00.180 align:start position:0%
with participation in a solar field
 
04:33:02.570 --> 04:33:02.580 align:start position:0%
and I don't know the actual numbers
 
04:33:05.150 --> 04:33:05.160 align:start position:0%
we're in our infancy we just started
 
04:33:08.209 --> 04:33:08.219 align:start position:0%
this commission last fall and we've been
 
04:33:10.551 --> 04:33:10.561 align:start position:0%
looking at always uh
 
04:33:13.789 --> 04:33:13.799 align:start position:0%
to find a cap on our energy costs we
 
04:33:17.029 --> 04:33:17.039 align:start position:0%
just are under currently entertaining a
 
04:33:17.039 --> 04:33:18.529 align:start position:0%
just are under currently entertaining a
contract

04:33:18.529 --> 04:33:18.539 align:start position:0%
contract
 
04:33:21.289 --> 04:33:21.299 align:start position:0%
um like many communities in the area to
 
04:33:23.449 --> 04:33:23.459 align:start position:0%
convert our Municipal lights
 
04:33:26.631 --> 04:33:26.641 align:start position:0%
to LED and uh
 
04:33:30.529 --> 04:33:30.539 align:start position:0%
we're just looking for ways to cap our
 
04:33:33.109 --> 04:33:33.119 align:start position:0%
energy costs reduce the taxpayers burden
 
04:33:35.631 --> 04:33:35.641 align:start position:0%
when it comes to energy and I just think
 
04:33:37.551 --> 04:33:37.561 align:start position:0%
that this bill
 
04:33:39.730 --> 04:33:39.740 align:start position:0%
is a baby step towards that direction
 
04:33:43.609 --> 04:33:43.619 align:start position:0%
and that's that's why we're here to make
 
04:33:46.070 --> 04:33:46.080 align:start position:0%
sure the house knows
 
04:33:48.109 --> 04:33:48.119 align:start position:0%
well that we're behind it in small
 
04:33:50.869 --> 04:33:50.879 align:start position:0%
communities like us are behind it
 
04:33:52.970 --> 04:33:52.980 align:start position:0%
representative Bernardi has a question
 
04:33:57.590 --> 04:33:57.600 align:start position:0%
okay thank you chairman did you uh just
 
04:34:00.410 --> 04:34:00.420 align:start position:0%
evaluate the costs and the benefits of
 
04:34:02.631 --> 04:34:02.641 align:start position:0%
putting up something for the town hall
 
04:34:05.330 --> 04:34:05.340 align:start position:0%
or for the school or whatever just of
 
04:34:07.670 --> 04:34:07.680 align:start position:0%
the appropriate size for those
 
04:34:07.680 --> 04:34:10.849 align:start position:0%
the appropriate size for those
facilities

04:34:10.849 --> 04:34:10.859 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:13.310 --> 04:34:13.320 align:start position:0%
we have not gotten the cost on that
 
04:34:13.320 --> 04:34:15.949 align:start position:0%
we have not gotten the cost on that
because

04:34:15.949 --> 04:34:15.959 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:17.750 --> 04:34:17.760 align:start position:0%
the suitability
 
04:34:20.209 --> 04:34:20.219 align:start position:0%
and the space is not there
 
04:34:24.289 --> 04:34:24.299 align:start position:0%
in order to ask for a quote town hall is
 
04:34:25.551 --> 04:34:25.561 align:start position:0%
a very small
 
04:34:29.150 --> 04:34:29.160 align:start position:0%
building very small area
 
04:34:29.160 --> 04:34:30.230 align:start position:0%
building very small area
um

04:34:30.230 --> 04:34:30.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:34:33.230 --> 04:34:33.240 align:start position:0%
the school the orientation is not such
 
04:34:37.490 --> 04:34:37.500 align:start position:0%
that the building itself would support
 
04:34:41.090 --> 04:34:41.100 align:start position:0%
a solar array that would uh be
 
04:34:45.529 --> 04:34:45.539 align:start position:0%
necessary for reducing that cost
 
04:34:45.539 --> 04:34:47.449 align:start position:0%
necessary for reducing that cost
um

04:34:47.449 --> 04:34:47.459 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:34:51.289 --> 04:34:51.299 align:start position:0%
and basically you know the same is true
 
04:34:54.051 --> 04:34:54.061 align:start position:0%
for uh Waste Water treatment I mean it's
 
04:34:54.061 --> 04:34:55.250 align:start position:0%
for uh Waste Water treatment I mean it's
shaded

04:34:55.250 --> 04:34:55.260 align:start position:0%
shaded
 
04:34:58.429 --> 04:34:58.439 align:start position:0%
considerably by trees
 
04:35:02.810 --> 04:35:02.820 align:start position:0%
and you the orientation
 
04:35:05.929 --> 04:35:05.939 align:start position:0%
has to be favorable for a solar field to
 
04:35:09.349 --> 04:35:09.359 align:start position:0%
work and that's not the case in our
 
04:35:11.810 --> 04:35:11.820 align:start position:0%
our particular example anyway and I I
 
04:35:14.090 --> 04:35:14.100 align:start position:0%
don't think we're unique
 
04:35:16.849 --> 04:35:16.859 align:start position:0%
in that lots of small towns have a
 
04:35:18.529 --> 04:35:18.539 align:start position:0%
number of small buildings and they're
 
04:35:21.590 --> 04:35:21.600 align:start position:0%
not in the smaller towns not necessarily
 
04:35:22.910 --> 04:35:22.920 align:start position:0%
A cleared area
 
04:35:27.230 --> 04:35:27.240 align:start position:0%
for solar to be with viable possibility
 
04:35:27.240 --> 04:35:30.830 align:start position:0%
for solar to be with viable possibility
so

04:35:30.830 --> 04:35:30.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:34.250 --> 04:35:34.260 align:start position:0%
you know once again I say we do have
 
04:35:37.010 --> 04:35:37.020 align:start position:0%
land that would be favorable
 
04:35:37.020 --> 04:35:38.510 align:start position:0%
land that would be favorable
but

04:35:38.510 --> 04:35:38.520 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:35:40.849 --> 04:35:40.859 align:start position:0%
um we would need
 
04:35:43.429 --> 04:35:43.439 align:start position:0%
to be able to Parlay
 
04:35:45.529 --> 04:35:45.539 align:start position:0%
the effort in order to be able to make
 
04:35:47.689 --> 04:35:47.699 align:start position:0%
it feasible we certainly couldn't
 
04:35:49.310 --> 04:35:49.320 align:start position:0%
come up with the kind of money that
 
04:35:51.890 --> 04:35:51.900 align:start position:0%
Rockingham County is suggesting they're
 
04:35:54.170 --> 04:35:54.180 align:start position:0%
they're going to spend
 
04:35:55.670 --> 04:35:55.680 align:start position:0%
um but
 
04:35:58.070 --> 04:35:58.080 align:start position:0%
together whatever the cost is we think
 
04:36:01.910 --> 04:36:01.920 align:start position:0%
we could make sense to the public so so
 
04:36:03.830 --> 04:36:03.840 align:start position:0%
on that land that you do have available
 
04:36:06.590 --> 04:36:06.600 align:start position:0%
could you put up a facility size to
 
04:36:08.750 --> 04:36:08.760 align:start position:0%
handle the water treatment plant the
 
04:36:12.250 --> 04:36:12.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:14.990 --> 04:36:15.000 align:start position:0%
definitely but I don't know what the
 
04:36:15.000 --> 04:36:17.470 align:start position:0%
definitely but I don't know what the
transmission

04:36:17.470 --> 04:36:17.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:21.230 --> 04:36:21.240 align:start position:0%
cost would be and um
 
04:36:23.390 --> 04:36:23.400 align:start position:0%
that's something that I guess is would
 
04:36:26.150 --> 04:36:26.160 align:start position:0%
would require more research going down
 
04:36:28.369 --> 04:36:28.379 align:start position:0%
but if you're in for Penny you ought to
 
04:36:30.170 --> 04:36:30.180 align:start position:0%
be in for a pound I mean why shouldn't
 
04:36:33.349 --> 04:36:33.359 align:start position:0%
we be able to uh to get a bigger scale
 
04:36:38.631 --> 04:36:38.641 align:start position:0%
of economy than than just support
 
04:36:40.730 --> 04:36:40.740 align:start position:0%
um basically be able to afford or
 
04:36:43.070 --> 04:36:43.080 align:start position:0%
support a solar array I mean we're
 
04:36:44.179 --> 04:36:44.189 align:start position:0%
talking probably
 
04:36:44.189 --> 04:36:44.631 align:start position:0%
talking probably
[Music]

04:36:44.631 --> 04:36:44.641 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:36:44.641 --> 04:36:45.949 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

04:36:45.949 --> 04:36:45.959 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:36:48.769 --> 04:36:48.779 align:start position:0%
you know a much smaller array than what
 
04:36:52.131 --> 04:36:52.141 align:start position:0%
the economy of scale would would require
 
04:36:55.090 --> 04:36:55.100 align:start position:0%
I understand thank you thank you
 
04:36:57.890 --> 04:36:57.900 align:start position:0%
representative partial has a question
 
04:36:59.570 --> 04:36:59.580 align:start position:0%
yes thank you chair and thank you for
 
04:37:01.490 --> 04:37:01.500 align:start position:0%
Testimony today
 
04:37:01.500 --> 04:37:02.449 align:start position:0%
Testimony today
um

04:37:02.449 --> 04:37:02.459 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:37:05.209 --> 04:37:05.219 align:start position:0%
the situation that's described with your
 
04:37:07.250 --> 04:37:07.260 align:start position:0%
town hall and with your school and with
 
04:37:09.410 --> 04:37:09.420 align:start position:0%
your Wastewater Plant could I see that
 
04:37:12.470 --> 04:37:12.480 align:start position:0%
as an analogy of the problem that all
 
04:37:14.269 --> 04:37:14.279 align:start position:0%
these small towns are having facing the
 
04:37:17.631 --> 04:37:17.641 align:start position:0%
economy of scale that makes uh anything
 
04:37:19.551 --> 04:37:19.561 align:start position:0%
less than hitting that sweet spot of
 
04:37:22.369 --> 04:37:22.379 align:start position:0%
three to five megawatts
 
04:37:26.330 --> 04:37:26.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:29.689 --> 04:37:29.699 align:start position:0%
I can't speak to that because I haven't
 
04:37:29.699 --> 04:37:31.070 align:start position:0%
I can't speak to that because I haven't
uh

04:37:31.070 --> 04:37:31.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:37:32.929 --> 04:37:32.939 align:start position:0%
I don't know what
 
04:37:35.029 --> 04:37:35.039 align:start position:0%
the size of other communities are or
 
04:37:37.070 --> 04:37:37.080 align:start position:0%
what their budget what their own energy
 
04:37:39.709 --> 04:37:39.719 align:start position:0%
budgets are so I really can't speak to
 
04:37:42.170 --> 04:37:42.180 align:start position:0%
that I just know from Rollinsford
 
04:37:46.070 --> 04:37:46.080 align:start position:0%
standpoint okay it
 
04:37:49.131 --> 04:37:49.141 align:start position:0%
um would make sense to be able to
 
04:37:50.810 --> 04:37:50.820 align:start position:0%
get together with other communities
 
04:37:53.449 --> 04:37:53.459 align:start position:0%
close by
 
04:37:53.459 --> 04:37:54.349 align:start position:0%
close by
um

04:37:54.349 --> 04:37:54.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:37:58.189 --> 04:37:58.199 align:start position:0%
our resource is is there and we'd like
 
04:37:59.990 --> 04:38:00.000 align:start position:0%
to be able to
 
04:38:02.029 --> 04:38:02.039 align:start position:0%
use our resource
 
04:38:04.609 --> 04:38:04.619 align:start position:0%
and help those communities that might
 
04:38:06.890 --> 04:38:06.900 align:start position:0%
not have the availability
 
04:38:10.789 --> 04:38:10.799 align:start position:0%
of land that we do and all of us work
 
04:38:13.789 --> 04:38:13.799 align:start position:0%
towards a common goal I I don't know I
 
04:38:16.131 --> 04:38:16.141 align:start position:0%
haven't spoken with enough of other
 
04:38:18.051 --> 04:38:18.061 align:start position:0%
communities to know what their demands
 
04:38:21.590 --> 04:38:21.600 align:start position:0%
are or I know some have successfully put
 
04:38:26.269 --> 04:38:26.279 align:start position:0%
solar arrays on school in Barrington
 
04:38:28.131 --> 04:38:28.141 align:start position:0%
and um
 
04:38:31.910 --> 04:38:31.920 align:start position:0%
and other Municipal facilities
 
04:38:34.131 --> 04:38:34.141 align:start position:0%
um I'm aware of the Brentford Brentwood
 
04:38:37.010 --> 04:38:37.020 align:start position:0%
I think did a solar field that
 
04:38:38.709 --> 04:38:38.719 align:start position:0%
accommodated there
 
04:38:41.029 --> 04:38:41.039 align:start position:0%
municipalities needs
 
04:38:44.330 --> 04:38:44.340 align:start position:0%
but I don't have enough
 
04:38:47.269 --> 04:38:47.279 align:start position:0%
um information to know
 
04:38:50.990 --> 04:38:51.000 align:start position:0%
the ins and outs of how they stack up to
 
04:38:51.000 --> 04:38:52.369 align:start position:0%
the ins and outs of how they stack up to
Rollinsford

04:38:52.369 --> 04:38:52.379 align:start position:0%
Rollinsford
 
04:38:56.631 --> 04:38:56.641 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:58.429 --> 04:38:58.439 align:start position:0%
okay thank you sir we appreciate you
 
04:39:00.189 --> 04:39:00.199 align:start position:0%
being here today
 
04:39:03.410 --> 04:39:03.420 align:start position:0%
or pink cards left
 
04:39:06.349 --> 04:39:06.359 align:start position:0%
and I have called on all these people
 
04:39:08.269 --> 04:39:08.279 align:start position:0%
before but I'm going to go through the
 
04:39:10.070 --> 04:39:10.080 align:start position:0%
cards again in case some people walked
 
04:39:12.410 --> 04:39:12.420 align:start position:0%
in who weren't here when I called on
 
04:39:14.150 --> 04:39:14.160 align:start position:0%
them before is Paul
 
04:39:24.590 --> 04:39:24.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:26.750 --> 04:39:26.760 align:start position:0%
oh I'm sorry to hear that could you
 
04:39:29.869 --> 04:39:29.879 align:start position:0%
pronounce your last name for me I panish
 
04:39:32.929 --> 04:39:32.939 align:start position:0%
panich like Spanish without the S oh
 
04:39:34.789 --> 04:39:34.799 align:start position:0%
okay okay well thank you sorry to
 
04:39:36.709 --> 04:39:36.719 align:start position:0%
mispronounce it no and thank you for the
 
04:39:39.170 --> 04:39:39.180 align:start position:0%
opportunity to address you today
 
04:39:41.270 --> 04:39:41.280 align:start position:0%
um I'm chair of the Barrington energy
 
04:39:43.310 --> 04:39:43.320 align:start position:0%
committee I am not speaking on their
 
04:39:45.770 --> 04:39:45.780 align:start position:0%
behalf due to the short notice I was
 
04:39:47.570 --> 04:39:47.580 align:start position:0%
unable to get a consensus of the
 
04:39:50.030 --> 04:39:50.040 align:start position:0%
committee on what we would how we would
 
04:39:52.130 --> 04:39:52.140 align:start position:0%
address this here so I'm speaking on my
 
04:39:54.530 --> 04:39:54.540 align:start position:0%
own and I'm speaking in favor of Senate
 
04:39:56.208 --> 04:39:56.218 align:start position:0%
bill 68.
 
04:39:58.490 --> 04:39:58.500 align:start position:0%
um it represents what seems to be to be
 
04:40:00.410 --> 04:40:00.420 align:start position:0%
a minor legislative addition to the
 
04:40:03.530 --> 04:40:03.540 align:start position:0%
previously passed House Bill 315 and it
 
04:40:05.690 --> 04:40:05.700 align:start position:0%
would level level the field for smaller
 
04:40:07.550 --> 04:40:07.560 align:start position:0%
towns to gain efficiencies of scale
 
04:40:10.250 --> 04:40:10.260 align:start position:0%
reduce costs for shelled Municipal solar
 
04:40:10.260 --> 04:40:11.930 align:start position:0%
reduce costs for shelled Municipal solar
installations

04:40:11.930 --> 04:40:11.940 align:start position:0%
installations
 
04:40:14.390 --> 04:40:14.400 align:start position:0%
which are already available to larger
 
04:40:15.830 --> 04:40:15.840 align:start position:0%
cities and towns that are taking
 
04:40:18.288 --> 04:40:18.298 align:start position:0%
advantage of that now I'm sorry if I'm
 
04:40:20.470 --> 04:40:20.480 align:start position:0%
covering area we've already been over
 
04:40:23.030 --> 04:40:23.040 align:start position:0%
there are other reasons in addition to
 
04:40:24.650 --> 04:40:24.660 align:start position:0%
the economy of scale that could benefit
 
04:40:27.170 --> 04:40:27.180 align:start position:0%
some towns were this option to be
 
04:40:29.690 --> 04:40:29.700 align:start position:0%
available to cite joint installation
 
04:40:32.390 --> 04:40:32.400 align:start position:0%
with other municipalities one of these
 
04:40:34.368 --> 04:40:34.378 align:start position:0%
is the availability of sighting for
 
04:40:36.708 --> 04:40:36.718 align:start position:0%
medium scale solar installations such as
 
04:40:36.718 --> 04:40:37.670 align:start position:0%
medium scale solar installations such as
these

04:40:37.670 --> 04:40:37.680 align:start position:0%
these
 
04:40:39.948 --> 04:40:39.958 align:start position:0%
most towns have a decentralized
 
04:40:42.770 --> 04:40:42.780 align:start position:0%
infrastructure it is generally most
 
04:40:45.050 --> 04:40:45.060 align:start position:0%
Advantage advantageous to implement
 
04:40:47.690 --> 04:40:47.700 align:start position:0%
on-site behind the meter systems for
 
04:40:49.490 --> 04:40:49.500 align:start position:0%
direct utilization of power that's
 
04:40:51.590 --> 04:40:51.600 align:start position:0%
generated however it's not always
 
04:40:53.990 --> 04:40:54.000 align:start position:0%
practical to to do this for any number
 
04:40:56.510 --> 04:40:56.520 align:start position:0%
of reasons some of those would be space
 
04:40:59.690 --> 04:40:59.700 align:start position:0%
exposure structural building issues on
 
04:41:01.490 --> 04:41:01.500 align:start position:0%
buildings which were not designed to
 
04:41:04.730 --> 04:41:04.740 align:start position:0%
support arrays on the roofs so this can
 
04:41:06.830 --> 04:41:06.840 align:start position:0%
make a centralized generation facility
 
04:41:09.410 --> 04:41:09.420 align:start position:0%
to offset Municipal usage an attractive
 
04:41:12.948 --> 04:41:12.958 align:start position:0%
option however the availability of sites
 
04:41:15.050 --> 04:41:15.060 align:start position:0%
can be a significant problem
 
04:41:17.270 --> 04:41:17.280 align:start position:0%
one of the sighting concerns which we've
 
04:41:20.030 --> 04:41:20.040 align:start position:0%
run into in Barrington is the concern of
 
04:41:21.830 --> 04:41:21.840 align:start position:0%
residents that such a facility would
 
04:41:23.930 --> 04:41:23.940 align:start position:0%
negatively affect their property values
 
04:41:26.868 --> 04:41:26.878 align:start position:0%
for those in the immediate vicinity of
 
04:41:28.310 --> 04:41:28.320 align:start position:0%
the solar field
 
04:41:30.470 --> 04:41:30.480 align:start position:0%
recent Studies have shown sighting of
 
04:41:34.310 --> 04:41:34.320 align:start position:0%
solar solar installations in areas that
 
04:41:37.910 --> 04:41:37.920 align:start position:0%
have been cleared by fallow areas such
 
04:41:40.730 --> 04:41:40.740 align:start position:0%
as abandoned or played out gravel pits
 
04:41:43.310 --> 04:41:43.320 align:start position:0%
landfields Brownfield sites if they
 
04:41:45.890 --> 04:41:45.900 align:start position:0%
happen to be available do not negatively
 
04:41:49.250 --> 04:41:49.260 align:start position:0%
affect property values for properties in
 
04:41:52.750 --> 04:41:52.760 align:start position:0%
the immediate vicinity of the array
 
04:41:55.628 --> 04:41:55.638 align:start position:0%
not all towns have such sites available
 
04:41:57.890 --> 04:41:57.900 align:start position:0%
that also are near the power
 
04:42:00.350 --> 04:42:00.360 align:start position:0%
infrastructure necessary for the power
 
04:42:04.250 --> 04:42:04.260 align:start position:0%
of distribution from that site
 
04:42:06.110 --> 04:42:06.120 align:start position:0%
to build out that power line
 
04:42:07.850 --> 04:42:07.860 align:start position:0%
infrastructure it can represent a
 
04:42:11.150 --> 04:42:11.160 align:start position:0%
significant additional cost and can make
 
04:42:14.208 --> 04:42:14.218 align:start position:0%
the feasibility of this impractical
 
04:42:16.670 --> 04:42:16.680 align:start position:0%
the ability to jointly develop sites
 
04:42:18.770 --> 04:42:18.780 align:start position:0%
which are already well situated with
 
04:42:20.750 --> 04:42:20.760 align:start position:0%
regards to the power infrastructure and
 
04:42:22.970 --> 04:42:22.980 align:start position:0%
site conditions could be a significant
 
04:42:25.128 --> 04:42:25.138 align:start position:0%
Aid to helping municipals gain the
 
04:42:27.708 --> 04:42:27.718 align:start position:0%
economies of scale to reduce the cost of
 
04:42:30.288 --> 04:42:30.298 align:start position:0%
Municipal Power for their residents and
 
04:42:32.810 --> 04:42:32.820 align:start position:0%
in this sense going to some of your
 
04:42:34.810 --> 04:42:34.820 align:start position:0%
questions to the previous speaker
 
04:42:37.730 --> 04:42:37.740 align:start position:0%
optimization is always an issue we're
 
04:42:39.590 --> 04:42:39.600 align:start position:0%
always trying to come there there's
 
04:42:42.070 --> 04:42:42.080 align:start position:0%
always a variety of options available
 
04:42:45.530 --> 04:42:45.540 align:start position:0%
it's our job to optimize the selections
 
04:42:47.750 --> 04:42:47.760 align:start position:0%
that we're making and and what we're
 
04:42:50.090 --> 04:42:50.100 align:start position:0%
presenting to our residents as
 
04:42:52.430 --> 04:42:52.440 align:start position:0%
possibilities and generally what we're
 
04:42:54.770 --> 04:42:54.780 align:start position:0%
looking at is how to reduce costs to the
 
04:42:57.470 --> 04:42:57.480 align:start position:0%
greatest extent possible
 
04:42:57.480 --> 04:42:58.430 align:start position:0%
greatest extent possible
um

04:42:58.430 --> 04:42:58.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:43:00.530 --> 04:43:00.540 align:start position:0%
but perhaps the most convincing reason
 
04:43:03.890 --> 04:43:03.900 align:start position:0%
for fast passing sb68 in my mind is that
 
04:43:05.810 --> 04:43:05.820 align:start position:0%
there's really doesn't seem to be any
 
04:43:09.128 --> 04:43:09.138 align:start position:0%
reason not to do so why should the
 
04:43:11.930 --> 04:43:11.940 align:start position:0%
Regulatory Agencies have an arbitrary
 
04:43:14.330 --> 04:43:14.340 align:start position:0%
rule in place serves no purpose other
 
04:43:17.150 --> 04:43:17.160 align:start position:0%
than to increase the cost of power to
 
04:43:19.010 --> 04:43:19.020 align:start position:0%
smaller municipalities in their
 
04:43:19.020 --> 04:43:19.910 align:start position:0%
smaller municipalities in their
residence

04:43:19.910 --> 04:43:19.920 align:start position:0%
residence
 
04:43:22.128 --> 04:43:22.138 align:start position:0%
if the utilities don't have the
 
04:43:24.530 --> 04:43:24.540 align:start position:0%
necessary capabilities in place to allow
 
04:43:27.170 --> 04:43:27.180 align:start position:0%
for these facilities and I'm saying that
 
04:43:28.730 --> 04:43:28.740 align:start position:0%
when I'm when I'm saying that I'm
 
04:43:31.430 --> 04:43:31.440 align:start position:0%
thinking in an automated fashion
 
04:43:33.410 --> 04:43:33.420 align:start position:0%
it's because it's been profitable for
 
04:43:35.510 --> 04:43:35.520 align:start position:0%
them to ignore the need for modernizing
 
04:43:37.070 --> 04:43:37.080 align:start position:0%
their metering and billing
 
04:43:37.080 --> 04:43:38.510 align:start position:0%
their metering and billing
infrastructures

04:43:38.510 --> 04:43:38.520 align:start position:0%
infrastructures
 
04:43:40.430 --> 04:43:40.440 align:start position:0%
in the past due the type of power
 
04:43:43.128 --> 04:43:43.138 align:start position:0%
generation commonly available this
 
04:43:45.650 --> 04:43:45.660 align:start position:0%
didn't result in significant cost to
 
04:43:45.660 --> 04:43:46.850 align:start position:0%
didn't result in significant cost to
Consumers

04:43:46.850 --> 04:43:46.860 align:start position:0%
Consumers
 
04:43:48.830 --> 04:43:48.840 align:start position:0%
but this says this hasn't been the case
 
04:43:51.410 --> 04:43:51.420 align:start position:0%
for some time now now that the cost of
 
04:43:53.208 --> 04:43:53.218 align:start position:0%
additional renewable generation has
 
04:43:55.190 --> 04:43:55.200 align:start position:0%
become the lowest cost option available
 
04:43:58.128 --> 04:43:58.138 align:start position:0%
this situation has changed it's
 
04:43:59.990 --> 04:44:00.000 align:start position:0%
essential that utilities build out the
 
04:44:02.628 --> 04:44:02.638 align:start position:0%
capabilities necessary to support such
 
04:44:04.788 --> 04:44:04.798 align:start position:0%
shared infrastructure along with other
 
04:44:07.010 --> 04:44:07.020 align:start position:0%
types of disaggregation such as
 
04:44:11.628 --> 04:44:11.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:13.788 --> 04:44:13.798 align:start position:0%
thank you appreciate you being here to
 
04:44:16.550 --> 04:44:16.560 align:start position:0%
give us your perspective representative
 
04:44:19.070 --> 04:44:19.080 align:start position:0%
partial has a question for you
 
04:44:22.850 --> 04:44:22.860 align:start position:0%
thank you chair and easy question is
 
04:44:24.830 --> 04:44:24.840 align:start position:0%
your testimony available did you mail it
 
04:44:27.410 --> 04:44:27.420 align:start position:0%
to the committee I did not I'd be glad
 
04:44:29.570 --> 04:44:29.580 align:start position:0%
to give this as part of the record it
 
04:44:34.250 --> 04:44:34.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:36.590 --> 04:44:36.600 align:start position:0%
nope thank you
 
04:44:38.868 --> 04:44:38.878 align:start position:0%
see no additional questions I'll thank
 
04:44:40.970 --> 04:44:40.980 align:start position:0%
you again for being here and call next
 
04:44:51.350 --> 04:44:51.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:09.470 --> 04:45:09.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:13.128 --> 04:45:13.138 align:start position:0%
Lou grondin of Lee I'm on the Lee energy
 
04:45:16.368 --> 04:45:16.378 align:start position:0%
committee and also uh I'm the chairman
 
04:45:18.948 --> 04:45:18.958 align:start position:0%
of the Lee energy committee and also the
 
04:45:21.288 --> 04:45:21.298 align:start position:0%
chairman of the Lee Community power
 
04:45:21.298 --> 04:45:22.430 align:start position:0%
chairman of the Lee Community power
committee

04:45:22.430 --> 04:45:22.440 align:start position:0%
committee
 
04:45:25.190 --> 04:45:25.200 align:start position:0%
and um
 
04:45:27.788 --> 04:45:27.798 align:start position:0%
the the main purpose
 
04:45:30.230 --> 04:45:30.240 align:start position:0%
one of our main goals in in the
 
04:45:33.110 --> 04:45:33.120 align:start position:0%
committee is to save
 
04:45:36.350 --> 04:45:36.360 align:start position:0%
money to the town on energy issues
 
04:45:40.128 --> 04:45:40.138 align:start position:0%
whether it's heating power and that's
 
04:45:42.050 --> 04:45:42.060 align:start position:0%
what that's what we spend most of our
 
04:45:43.550 --> 04:45:43.560 align:start position:0%
time on
 
04:45:47.090 --> 04:45:47.100 align:start position:0%
we've just had a warrant article on
 
04:45:48.730 --> 04:45:48.740 align:start position:0%
community power
 
04:45:52.730 --> 04:45:52.740 align:start position:0%
and the main goal of that was to save
 
04:45:56.030 --> 04:45:56.040 align:start position:0%
save money for our residents and that
 
04:46:02.090 --> 04:46:02.100 align:start position:0%
passed 5 18 4 and 85 against so I can I
 
04:46:04.150 --> 04:46:04.160 align:start position:0%
can say that
 
04:46:08.708 --> 04:46:08.718 align:start position:0%
people in our town are very focused on
 
04:46:10.850 --> 04:46:10.860 align:start position:0%
saving money
 
04:46:13.550 --> 04:46:13.560 align:start position:0%
saving money for the town saving money
 
04:46:16.610 --> 04:46:16.620 align:start position:0%
for themselves and everybody knows we're
 
04:46:18.830 --> 04:46:18.840 align:start position:0%
one of the states that have the highest
 
04:46:21.770 --> 04:46:21.780 align:start position:0%
energy costs in the country so that's
 
04:46:23.930 --> 04:46:23.940 align:start position:0%
that's very important
 
04:46:23.940 --> 04:46:24.890 align:start position:0%
that's very important
um

04:46:24.890 --> 04:46:24.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:46:27.948 --> 04:46:27.958 align:start position:0%
we're surrounded by six towns we've got
 
04:46:30.470 --> 04:46:30.480 align:start position:0%
Barrington Madbury
 
04:46:30.480 --> 04:46:32.030 align:start position:0%
Barrington Madbury
Durham

04:46:32.030 --> 04:46:32.040 align:start position:0%
Durham
 
04:46:33.470 --> 04:46:33.480 align:start position:0%
New Market
 
04:46:33.480 --> 04:46:35.208 align:start position:0%
New Market
Epping

04:46:35.208 --> 04:46:35.218 align:start position:0%
Epping
 
04:46:36.890 --> 04:46:36.900 align:start position:0%
and Nottingham
 
04:46:36.900 --> 04:46:38.390 align:start position:0%
and Nottingham
so

04:46:38.390 --> 04:46:38.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:46:42.590 --> 04:46:42.600 align:start position:0%
um between those six towns and us
 
04:46:45.350 --> 04:46:45.360 align:start position:0%
um that's a that's a big load there's a
 
04:46:47.510 --> 04:46:47.520 align:start position:0%
lot of schools there's a lot of town
 
04:46:50.030 --> 04:46:50.040 align:start position:0%
buildings and
 
04:46:55.670 --> 04:46:55.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:00.890 --> 04:47:00.900 align:start position:0%
worth it to form a community of towns to
 
04:47:04.430 --> 04:47:04.440 align:start position:0%
lower the costs and everyone knows that
 
04:47:06.350 --> 04:47:06.360 align:start position:0%
economies of scales
 
04:47:09.170 --> 04:47:09.180 align:start position:0%
a scale is very important in lowering
 
04:47:13.190 --> 04:47:13.200 align:start position:0%
costs so I haven't we're having our
 
04:47:15.310 --> 04:47:15.320 align:start position:0%
meeting tomorrow morning so I haven't
 
04:47:18.590 --> 04:47:18.600 align:start position:0%
actually I don't actually hit
 
04:47:18.600 --> 04:47:19.910 align:start position:0%
actually I don't actually hit
um

04:47:19.910 --> 04:47:19.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:47:21.708 --> 04:47:21.718 align:start position:0%
I can't actually say the committee
 
04:47:24.170 --> 04:47:24.180 align:start position:0%
itself is
 
04:47:26.930 --> 04:47:26.940 align:start position:0%
voted to support this but I I can
 
04:47:31.010 --> 04:47:31.020 align:start position:0%
guarantee you they would and uh so I'm
 
04:47:34.610 --> 04:47:34.620 align:start position:0%
just asking for the com the committee to
 
04:47:37.430 --> 04:47:37.440 align:start position:0%
support this it makes sense and it's
 
04:47:40.368 --> 04:47:40.378 align:start position:0%
like a Chicken and the Egg situation you
 
04:47:43.730 --> 04:47:43.740 align:start position:0%
gotta have one first before you can have
 
04:47:46.310 --> 04:47:46.320 align:start position:0%
the other and so it has to start
 
04:47:46.320 --> 04:47:47.570 align:start position:0%
the other and so it has to start
somewhere

04:47:47.570 --> 04:47:47.580 align:start position:0%
somewhere
 
04:47:49.990 --> 04:47:50.000 align:start position:0%
this is where it has to start
 
04:47:52.910 --> 04:47:52.920 align:start position:0%
there's no reason why the larger towns
 
04:47:55.788 --> 04:47:55.798 align:start position:0%
should be able to get the economies of
 
04:48:00.948 --> 04:48:00.958 align:start position:0%
scale and the smaller ones don't so
 
04:48:03.590 --> 04:48:03.600 align:start position:0%
um I just wanted to keep that short
 
04:48:06.650 --> 04:48:06.660 align:start position:0%
not repeat what everybody else has said
 
04:48:06.660 --> 04:48:08.270 align:start position:0%
not repeat what everybody else has said
so

04:48:08.270 --> 04:48:08.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:48:10.490 --> 04:48:10.500 align:start position:0%
well thank you questions from the
 
04:48:12.590 --> 04:48:12.600 align:start position:0%
committee representative munz has a
 
04:48:14.930 --> 04:48:14.940 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair and thank
 
04:48:17.690 --> 04:48:17.700 align:start position:0%
you for for coming in in any of the work
 
04:48:19.970 --> 04:48:19.980 align:start position:0%
that you have done on the energy
 
04:48:23.270 --> 04:48:23.280 align:start position:0%
committee and and in any discussions
 
04:48:25.250 --> 04:48:25.260 align:start position:0%
that you may have had with your local
 
04:48:26.930 --> 04:48:26.940 align:start position:0%
utility has
 
04:48:29.750 --> 04:48:29.760 align:start position:0%
has the problems of interconnection does
 
04:48:31.850 --> 04:48:31.860 align:start position:0%
that come up as an issue we have a big
 
04:48:35.030 --> 04:48:35.040 align:start position:0%
problem in in Lee yeah there's very very
 
04:48:38.150 --> 04:48:38.160 align:start position:0%
little interest infrastructure for
 
04:48:41.150 --> 04:48:41.160 align:start position:0%
there's basically no infrastructure for
 
04:48:43.850 --> 04:48:43.860 align:start position:0%
a large arrays in Lee I can I can tell
 
04:48:46.030 --> 04:48:46.040 align:start position:0%
you that
 
04:48:50.208 --> 04:48:50.218 align:start position:0%
follow-up follow-up so again in in those
 
04:48:52.250 --> 04:48:52.260 align:start position:0%
if to the extent you've had a follow-up
 
04:48:54.470 --> 04:48:54.480 align:start position:0%
conversation with the utility I mean if
 
04:48:56.390 --> 04:48:56.400 align:start position:0%
I haven't has there been a discussion
 
04:48:59.090 --> 04:48:59.100 align:start position:0%
about you know what kind of improvements
 
04:49:00.890 --> 04:49:00.900 align:start position:0%
might need to be made before you could
 
04:49:04.070 --> 04:49:04.080 align:start position:0%
actually Implement an array I haven't
 
04:49:06.230 --> 04:49:06.240 align:start position:0%
had any discuss we haven't had any
 
04:49:09.170 --> 04:49:09.180 align:start position:0%
discussions with the utilities uh but
 
04:49:10.690 --> 04:49:10.700 align:start position:0%
I've had
 
04:49:14.090 --> 04:49:14.100 align:start position:0%
one person in town was approached by a
 
04:49:18.288 --> 04:49:18.298 align:start position:0%
company who wanted to put a 10 Meg array
 
04:49:21.170 --> 04:49:21.180 align:start position:0%
on his property unfortunately the the
 
04:49:23.208 --> 04:49:23.218 align:start position:0%
closest uh
 
04:49:23.218 --> 04:49:24.350 align:start position:0%
closest uh
okay

04:49:24.350 --> 04:49:24.360 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:49:26.750 --> 04:49:26.760 align:start position:0%
connection to it was a mile and a half
 
04:49:29.690 --> 04:49:29.700 align:start position:0%
and there was there was a
 
04:49:32.208 --> 04:49:32.218 align:start position:0%
it fell through because of the cost of
 
04:49:32.218 --> 04:49:34.788 align:start position:0%
it fell through because of the cost of
of

04:49:34.788 --> 04:49:34.798 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:49:37.610 --> 04:49:37.620 align:start position:0%
the infrastructure
 
04:49:40.368 --> 04:49:40.378 align:start position:0%
to the convenient power
 
04:49:43.910 --> 04:49:43.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:45.708 --> 04:49:45.718 align:start position:0%
okay so you know further questions I
 
04:49:47.690 --> 04:49:47.700 align:start position:0%
thank you for being here to testify and
 
04:49:51.350 --> 04:49:51.360 align:start position:0%
I call finally last testifier on this
 
04:49:51.360 --> 04:49:52.250 align:start position:0%
I call finally last testifier on this
bill

04:49:52.250 --> 04:49:52.260 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:50:00.230 --> 04:50:00.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:02.570 --> 04:50:02.580 align:start position:0%
here okay
 
04:50:05.930 --> 04:50:05.940 align:start position:0%

04:50:09.230 --> 04:50:09.240 align:start position:0%
that completes our testimony on Senate
 
04:50:09.240 --> 04:50:10.190 align:start position:0%
that completes our testimony on Senate
bill

04:50:10.190 --> 04:50:10.200 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:50:12.530 --> 04:50:12.540 align:start position:0%
SB 68
 
04:50:14.270 --> 04:50:14.280 align:start position:0%
so we'll close the public hearing on
 
04:50:17.390 --> 04:50:17.400 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 68 and resume the public
 
04:50:21.890 --> 04:50:21.900 align:start position:0%

Department of energy to give us the
 
04:50:40.750 --> 04:50:40.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:43.430 --> 04:50:43.440 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chairman uh members of
 
04:50:44.868 --> 04:50:44.878 align:start position:0%

Griffin Roberge New Hampshire Department
 
04:50:47.990 --> 04:50:48.000 align:start position:0%
of energy
 
04:50:49.850 --> 04:50:49.860 align:start position:0%
um department is opposed to Senate Bill
 
04:50:52.368 --> 04:50:52.378 align:start position:0%
69 as amended by the Senate
 
04:50:55.070 --> 04:50:55.080 align:start position:0%
um running through the bill quite
 
04:50:55.080 --> 04:50:57.110 align:start position:0%
um running through the bill quite
briefly

04:50:57.110 --> 04:50:57.120 align:start position:0%
briefly
 
04:50:57.120 --> 04:50:58.788 align:start position:0%
briefly
um

04:50:58.788 --> 04:50:58.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:51:02.390 --> 04:51:02.400 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 69
 
04:51:05.090 --> 04:51:05.100 align:start position:0%
um creates an exception for a municipal
 
04:51:08.208 --> 04:51:08.218 align:start position:0%
host from the current one megawatt net
 
04:51:09.430 --> 04:51:09.440 align:start position:0%
metering cap
 
04:51:11.448 --> 04:51:11.458 align:start position:0%
under the definition of customer
 
04:51:11.458 --> 04:51:13.368 align:start position:0%
under the definition of customer
generator

04:51:13.368 --> 04:51:13.378 align:start position:0%
generator
 
04:51:16.010 --> 04:51:16.020 align:start position:0%
um section two Define creates the
 
04:51:19.610 --> 04:51:19.620 align:start position:0%
definition of a non-profit host which is
 
04:51:21.830 --> 04:51:21.840 align:start position:0%
very closely mirrors the municipal host
 
04:51:21.840 --> 04:51:23.810 align:start position:0%
very closely mirrors the municipal host
definition

04:51:23.810 --> 04:51:23.820 align:start position:0%
definition
 
04:51:25.368 --> 04:51:25.378 align:start position:0%
um total Peak generating capacity of
 
04:51:26.570 --> 04:51:26.580 align:start position:0%
greater than one less than five
 
04:51:29.208 --> 04:51:29.218 align:start position:0%
megawatts used to offset uh electricity
 
04:51:30.948 --> 04:51:30.958 align:start position:0%
requirements for a group of non-profits
 
04:51:32.570 --> 04:51:32.580 align:start position:0%
as long as all the nonprofits are in the
 
04:51:34.788 --> 04:51:34.798 align:start position:0%
same service utility much like a
 
04:51:36.890 --> 04:51:36.900 align:start position:0%
municipal host non-profit host can be
 
04:51:40.190 --> 04:51:40.200 align:start position:0%
publicly or privately owned and then
 
04:51:40.200 --> 04:51:40.788 align:start position:0%
publicly or privately owned and then
um

04:51:40.788 --> 04:51:40.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:51:42.590 --> 04:51:42.600 align:start position:0%
the definition of a non-profit under
 
04:51:44.990 --> 04:51:45.000 align:start position:0%
that statute is defined on lines 9 to
 
04:51:45.000 --> 04:51:46.010 align:start position:0%
that statute is defined on lines 9 to
12.

04:51:46.010 --> 04:51:46.020 align:start position:0%
12.
 
04:51:48.890 --> 04:51:48.900 align:start position:0%
and then section three goes further and
 
04:51:51.050 --> 04:51:51.060 align:start position:0%
adds an additional statutory exemption
 
04:51:53.270 --> 04:51:53.280 align:start position:0%
that permits non-profits who may already
 
04:51:56.030 --> 04:51:56.040 align:start position:0%
be customer generators themselves uh to
 
04:51:58.250 --> 04:51:58.260 align:start position:0%
take part in these uh Municipal host
 
04:51:58.260 --> 04:52:00.288 align:start position:0%
take part in these uh Municipal host
Arrangements

04:52:00.288 --> 04:52:00.298 align:start position:0%
Arrangements
 
04:52:02.930 --> 04:52:02.940 align:start position:0%
um holistically the the bill essentially
 
04:52:04.788 --> 04:52:04.798 align:start position:0%
creates a group host mechanism that goes
 
04:52:06.590 --> 04:52:06.600 align:start position:0%
above the one the current one megawatt
 
04:52:09.410 --> 04:52:09.420 align:start position:0%
cap for certain non-profits and emulates
 
04:52:11.390 --> 04:52:11.400 align:start position:0%
really the statutory model that exists
 
04:52:13.208 --> 04:52:13.218 align:start position:0%
for municipal hosts
 
04:52:15.830 --> 04:52:15.840 align:start position:0%
department does oppose this bill for
 
04:52:17.810 --> 04:52:17.820 align:start position:0%
several reasons as uh previously
 
04:52:19.670 --> 04:52:19.680 align:start position:0%
mentioned the department does oppose any
 
04:52:21.288 --> 04:52:21.298 align:start position:0%
changes to the state's net metering
 
04:52:23.270 --> 04:52:23.280 align:start position:0%
statute at this time while the puc's
 
04:52:27.890 --> 04:52:27.900 align:start position:0%
docket de 22060 is currently underway
 
04:52:30.230 --> 04:52:30.240 align:start position:0%
and uh as I've previously mentioned that
 
04:52:33.410 --> 04:52:33.420 align:start position:0%
docket will consider changes to the
 
04:52:35.150 --> 04:52:35.160 align:start position:0%
current net metering tariff structure
 
04:52:36.708 --> 04:52:36.718 align:start position:0%
including compensation for customer
 
04:52:40.190 --> 04:52:40.200 align:start position:0%
generators we would suggest laying that
 
04:52:42.890 --> 04:52:42.900 align:start position:0%
that process play out before making any
 
04:52:45.550 --> 04:52:45.560 align:start position:0%
sizable changes to net metering statutes
 
04:52:48.530 --> 04:52:48.540 align:start position:0%
additionally regarding the bill
 
04:52:50.690 --> 04:52:50.700 align:start position:0%
um we did have some technical uh
 
04:52:52.788 --> 04:52:52.798 align:start position:0%
concerns there is a lack of clarity
 
04:52:55.250 --> 04:52:55.260 align:start position:0%
around some of the entities listed as a
 
04:52:56.868 --> 04:52:56.878 align:start position:0%
non-profit definition I think some of
 
04:52:59.208 --> 04:52:59.218 align:start position:0%
the committee members asked some
 
04:53:01.750 --> 04:53:01.760 align:start position:0%
questions about that previously
 
04:53:04.850 --> 04:53:04.860 align:start position:0%
on line 20 it indicates that a
 
04:53:06.590 --> 04:53:06.600 align:start position:0%
non-profit means any Community or
 
04:53:08.270 --> 04:53:08.280 align:start position:0%
Technical College colleges and
 
04:53:08.280 --> 04:53:09.850 align:start position:0%
Technical College colleges and
universities

04:53:09.850 --> 04:53:09.860 align:start position:0%
universities
 
04:53:11.990 --> 04:53:12.000 align:start position:0%
hospitals as defined in another area
 
04:53:14.030 --> 04:53:14.040 align:start position:0%
statute housing authorities bona fide
 
04:53:15.830 --> 04:53:15.840 align:start position:0%
religious organizations and the peas
 
04:53:18.590 --> 04:53:18.600 align:start position:0%
Development Authority a couple of the
 
04:53:20.930 --> 04:53:20.940 align:start position:0%
concerns that we had is could for-profit
 
04:53:22.490 --> 04:53:22.500 align:start position:0%
colleges and universities potentially
 
04:53:24.948 --> 04:53:24.958 align:start position:0%
take advantage of this because that's
 
04:53:27.110 --> 04:53:27.120 align:start position:0%
not exactly spelled out so could a
 
04:53:28.970 --> 04:53:28.980 align:start position:0%
for-profit technically be a non-profit
 
04:53:31.850 --> 04:53:31.860 align:start position:0%
under this statute what does a bona fide
 
04:53:34.550 --> 04:53:34.560 align:start position:0%
religious organization mean those are
 
04:53:34.560 --> 04:53:35.448 align:start position:0%
religious organization mean those are
just

04:53:35.448 --> 04:53:35.458 align:start position:0%
just
 
04:53:36.830 --> 04:53:36.840 align:start position:0%
some of the questions that we had
 
04:53:38.650 --> 04:53:38.660 align:start position:0%
regarding that definition
 
04:53:41.448 --> 04:53:41.458 align:start position:0%
additionally and we're going to talk
 
04:53:45.310 --> 04:53:45.320 align:start position:0%
about this shortly but in Senate Bill 79
 
04:53:47.810 --> 04:53:47.820 align:start position:0%
the Senate did not address potential
 
04:53:49.970 --> 04:53:49.980 align:start position:0%
conflicts between the two bills both of
 
04:53:52.610 --> 04:53:52.620 align:start position:0%
them seek to do as section 2 and this
 
04:53:54.368 --> 04:53:54.378 align:start position:0%
bill identifies as create a new
 
04:53:57.550 --> 04:53:57.560 align:start position:0%
paragraph 2G
 
04:54:01.430 --> 04:54:01.440 align:start position:0%
if both were to pass and become law both
 
04:54:04.128 --> 04:54:04.138 align:start position:0%
uh again proposed creating that
 
04:54:06.470 --> 04:54:06.480 align:start position:0%
paragraph and if both became law one
 
04:54:08.510 --> 04:54:08.520 align:start position:0%
could potentially override the other and
 
04:54:10.368 --> 04:54:10.378 align:start position:0%
create significant inconsistencies in
 
04:54:12.730 --> 04:54:12.740 align:start position:0%
the state's net metering statutes
 
04:54:15.350 --> 04:54:15.360 align:start position:0%
so those are those are at least some of
 
04:54:16.430 --> 04:54:16.440 align:start position:0%
the technical ones that you have between
 
04:54:17.810 --> 04:54:17.820 align:start position:0%
two bills that you have pending before
 
04:54:20.208 --> 04:54:20.218 align:start position:0%
you today other than that that really
 
04:54:24.010 --> 04:54:24.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:26.690 --> 04:54:26.700 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Thomas has a
 
04:54:28.850 --> 04:54:28.860 align:start position:0%
question for you thank you Mr chairman
 
04:54:30.110 --> 04:54:30.120 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question I'm
 
04:54:33.350 --> 04:54:33.360 align:start position:0%
just curious since um this seems to be a
 
04:54:35.750 --> 04:54:35.760 align:start position:0%
puc DACA day
 
04:54:39.890 --> 04:54:39.900 align:start position:0%
um on several bills do you have any idea
 
04:54:43.430 --> 04:54:43.440 align:start position:0%
if any of what these bills that we've
 
04:54:46.010 --> 04:54:46.020 align:start position:0%
discussed today have has any of that
 
04:54:48.110 --> 04:54:48.120 align:start position:0%
subject matter come up during the docket
 
04:54:49.910 --> 04:54:49.920 align:start position:0%
that you're aware of I mean would they
 
04:54:51.948 --> 04:54:51.958 align:start position:0%
consider any of the stuff here I'd just
 
04:54:53.570 --> 04:54:53.580 align:start position:0%
like to know what what they're
 
04:54:55.070 --> 04:54:55.080 align:start position:0%
discussing since they've been at it for
 
04:54:56.628 --> 04:54:56.638 align:start position:0%
a while sure thank you for the question
 
04:54:58.368 --> 04:54:58.378 align:start position:0%
so I would just know that the docket
 
04:55:00.708 --> 04:55:00.718 align:start position:0%
really opened up this new one 22060
 
04:55:03.230 --> 04:55:03.240 align:start position:0%
opened up late last year and they're
 
04:55:05.570 --> 04:55:05.580 align:start position:0%
still in the in the I would respectfully
 
04:55:08.448 --> 04:55:08.458 align:start position:0%
submit the early stages of that docket
 
04:55:10.070 --> 04:55:10.080 align:start position:0%
um regarding
 
04:55:11.690 --> 04:55:11.700 align:start position:0%
um legislation you know I can I can
 
04:55:13.850 --> 04:55:13.860 align:start position:0%
point to the puc's order to open up the
 
04:55:15.410 --> 04:55:15.420 align:start position:0%
docket is that they pointed to Senate
 
04:55:18.110 --> 04:55:18.120 align:start position:0%
Bill 261 from last year and House Bill
 
04:55:21.708 --> 04:55:21.718 align:start position:0%
1599 as you know part of the reason or
 
04:55:24.350 --> 04:55:24.360 align:start position:0%
the Genesis to open that docket
 
04:55:26.448 --> 04:55:26.458 align:start position:0%
um we would respectfully submit letting
 
04:55:28.610 --> 04:55:28.620 align:start position:0%
that docket play out in its entirety
 
04:55:30.830 --> 04:55:30.840 align:start position:0%
before making further substantive
 
04:55:32.510 --> 04:55:32.520 align:start position:0%
changes to New Hampshire's net metering
 
04:55:32.520 --> 04:55:35.570 align:start position:0%
changes to New Hampshire's net metering
statutes

04:55:35.570 --> 04:55:35.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:37.610 --> 04:55:37.620 align:start position:0%
additional questions representative
 
04:55:39.708 --> 04:55:39.718 align:start position:0%
McGee has a question thank you Mr
 
04:55:41.570 --> 04:55:41.580 align:start position:0%
chairman and good to see you again Mr
 
04:55:44.390 --> 04:55:44.400 align:start position:0%
Robert I hope you enjoyed your lunch
 
04:55:44.400 --> 04:55:45.050 align:start position:0%
Robert I hope you enjoyed your lunch
um

04:55:45.050 --> 04:55:45.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:55:47.570 --> 04:55:47.580 align:start position:0%
well I have a question on what you just
 
04:55:50.150 --> 04:55:50.160 align:start position:0%
said about the docket
 
04:55:52.850 --> 04:55:52.860 align:start position:0%
um on tariff setting being related to
 
04:55:54.190 --> 04:55:54.200 align:start position:0%
whether we
 
04:55:56.510 --> 04:55:56.520 align:start position:0%
adopt any of these or update our net
 
04:55:59.030 --> 04:55:59.040 align:start position:0%
metering statutes and I guess the
 
04:56:01.090 --> 04:56:01.100 align:start position:0%
question that I have is
 
04:56:04.070 --> 04:56:04.080 align:start position:0%
the Tariff setting piece is really just
 
04:56:06.410 --> 04:56:06.420 align:start position:0%
what the value of net metering is right
 
04:56:08.750 --> 04:56:08.760 align:start position:0%
so that can change and go up and down
 
04:56:10.128 --> 04:56:10.138 align:start position:0%
and that but that's separate and
 
04:56:11.810 --> 04:56:11.820 align:start position:0%
distinct from whether or not we allow
 
04:56:14.750 --> 04:56:14.760 align:start position:0%
people to do net metering so the changes
 
04:56:16.850 --> 04:56:16.860 align:start position:0%
in the economic picture
 
04:56:18.410 --> 04:56:18.420 align:start position:0%
might happen for those individuals
 
04:56:20.030 --> 04:56:20.040 align:start position:0%
who've already invested or who are
 
04:56:21.530 --> 04:56:21.540 align:start position:0%
planning to invest
 
04:56:23.570 --> 04:56:23.580 align:start position:0%
but I I don't understand what the
 
04:56:24.708 --> 04:56:24.718 align:start position:0%
connection is to saying that we should
 
04:56:26.350 --> 04:56:26.360 align:start position:0%
hold up legislation in terms of
 
04:56:28.550 --> 04:56:28.560 align:start position:0%
responding to the people that just left
 
04:56:30.350 --> 04:56:30.360 align:start position:0%
here testifying that they're really
 
04:56:32.330 --> 04:56:32.340 align:start position:0%
trying to you know trying to lower their
 
04:56:34.430 --> 04:56:34.440 align:start position:0%
their bills no and I get that thank you
 
04:56:36.590 --> 04:56:36.600 align:start position:0%
very much for the question so uh to
 
04:56:38.330 --> 04:56:38.340 align:start position:0%
start off I would suggest is that the
 
04:56:40.490 --> 04:56:40.500 align:start position:0%
docket is looking at potential changes
 
04:56:42.410 --> 04:56:42.420 align:start position:0%
to the alternative net metering tariff
 
04:56:44.930 --> 04:56:44.940 align:start position:0%
that tariff applies to anything whether
 
04:56:46.670 --> 04:56:46.680 align:start position:0%
or not you're just a normal individual
 
04:56:47.990 --> 04:56:48.000 align:start position:0%
homeowner you know as a customer
 
04:56:49.788 --> 04:56:49.798 align:start position:0%
generator or whether or not you want to
 
04:56:51.470 --> 04:56:51.480 align:start position:0%
you know want to be a non-profit host or
 
04:56:53.150 --> 04:56:53.160 align:start position:0%
something to that effect
 
04:56:55.550 --> 04:56:55.560 align:start position:0%
um and again another element of that
 
04:56:57.288 --> 04:56:57.298 align:start position:0%
docket is reviewing the cost shifting
 
04:56:59.090 --> 04:56:59.100 align:start position:0%
impacts from
 
04:57:00.948 --> 04:57:00.958 align:start position:0%
um the current mechanism that's in play
 
04:57:02.868 --> 04:57:02.878 align:start position:0%
I think we would respectfully submit
 
04:57:04.788 --> 04:57:04.798 align:start position:0%
just let everything kind of remain
 
04:57:07.310 --> 04:57:07.320 align:start position:0%
static the way it is while the puc fully
 
04:57:09.288 --> 04:57:09.298 align:start position:0%
adjudicates these issues rather than
 
04:57:11.448 --> 04:57:11.458 align:start position:0%
making substantive changes to netmiring
 
04:57:12.770 --> 04:57:12.780 align:start position:0%
statutes where you might have an
 
04:57:15.890 --> 04:57:15.900 align:start position:0%
industrial hosted net a non-profit host
 
04:57:17.750 --> 04:57:17.760 align:start position:0%
an expansion of the current Municipal
 
04:57:20.570 --> 04:57:20.580 align:start position:0%
host statute we would encourage you know
 
04:57:23.330 --> 04:57:23.340 align:start position:0%
an economic review through that puc
 
04:57:25.128 --> 04:57:25.138 align:start position:0%
adjudicative process before making
 
04:57:26.810 --> 04:57:26.820 align:start position:0%
substantive changes to net viewing
 
04:57:29.628 --> 04:57:29.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:32.090 --> 04:57:32.100 align:start position:0%
so clarification you need a follow-up
 
04:57:34.070 --> 04:57:34.080 align:start position:0%
representative yes please okay go ahead
 
04:57:38.150 --> 04:57:38.160 align:start position:0%
so the objection is a concern for cost
 
04:57:41.510 --> 04:57:41.520 align:start position:0%
shifting again yes I mean again that is
 
04:57:43.128 --> 04:57:43.138 align:start position:0%
that is one of the things that the puc
 
04:57:44.990 --> 04:57:45.000 align:start position:0%
will be looking at in its adjudicative
 
04:57:46.910 --> 04:57:46.920 align:start position:0%
proceeding you know to the extent cost
 
04:57:48.770 --> 04:57:48.780 align:start position:0%
shifting is occurring and and the vder
 
04:57:50.868 --> 04:57:50.878 align:start position:0%
study it did identify that there is you
 
04:57:52.490 --> 04:57:52.500 align:start position:0%
know at this point a one percent cost
 
04:57:54.948 --> 04:57:54.958 align:start position:0%
shift we would submit letting that
 
04:57:56.990 --> 04:57:57.000 align:start position:0%
process play out to fully adjudicate
 
04:57:59.030 --> 04:57:59.040 align:start position:0%
these issues and
 
04:58:01.550 --> 04:58:01.560 align:start position:0%
not exacerbate any potential cost shift
 
04:58:03.230 --> 04:58:03.240 align:start position:0%
that's that's currently that's currently
 
04:58:05.750 --> 04:58:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:07.970 --> 04:58:07.980 align:start position:0%
okay representative munz asked a
 
04:58:09.770 --> 04:58:09.780 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair and thank
 
04:58:12.230 --> 04:58:12.240 align:start position:0%
you for uh being here again
 
04:58:14.270 --> 04:58:14.280 align:start position:0%
um as someone who spent a good part of
 
04:58:15.830 --> 04:58:15.840 align:start position:0%
the morning asking questions about
 
04:58:17.270 --> 04:58:17.280 align:start position:0%
definitions welcome to the definition
 
04:58:19.610 --> 04:58:19.620 align:start position:0%
dark side
 
04:58:19.620 --> 04:58:20.448 align:start position:0%
dark side
um

04:58:20.448 --> 04:58:20.458 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:58:20.458 --> 04:58:21.288 align:start position:0%
um
um

04:58:21.288 --> 04:58:21.298 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:58:23.690 --> 04:58:23.700 align:start position:0%
I understand you know that the concern
 
04:58:26.448 --> 04:58:26.458 align:start position:0%
you that you've shared about the you
 
04:58:29.270 --> 04:58:29.280 align:start position:0%
know the kind of the economic impact of
 
04:58:31.128 --> 04:58:31.138 align:start position:0%
any potential change like that this
 
04:58:32.810 --> 04:58:32.820 align:start position:0%
might have
 
04:58:34.850 --> 04:58:34.860 align:start position:0%
um but we we just heard from a number of
 
04:58:36.590 --> 04:58:36.600 align:start position:0%
people that you know talked about some
 
04:58:38.050 --> 04:58:38.060 align:start position:0%
of the technical
 
04:58:41.270 --> 04:58:41.280 align:start position:0%
challenges of you know implementing this
 
04:58:44.570 --> 04:58:44.580 align:start position:0%
kind of arrangement has the department
 
04:58:48.110 --> 04:58:48.120 align:start position:0%
or or anybody done any kind of a
 
04:58:49.850 --> 04:58:49.860 align:start position:0%
technical review to kind of understand
 
04:58:52.190 --> 04:58:52.200 align:start position:0%
you know what some of those challenges
 
04:58:54.288 --> 04:58:54.298 align:start position:0%
are what the landscape looks like and
 
04:58:56.150 --> 04:58:56.160 align:start position:0%
start to put together a plan on how we
 
04:58:58.250 --> 04:58:58.260 align:start position:0%
might want to address that sure so thank
 
04:58:59.868 --> 04:58:59.878 align:start position:0%
you for the question so
 
04:59:01.730 --> 04:59:01.740 align:start position:0%
um I know I know there were a number of
 
04:59:03.350 --> 04:59:03.360 align:start position:0%
things said in earlier testimonies sent
 
04:59:05.090 --> 04:59:05.100 align:start position:0%
Bill 68 regarding the Litany of things
 
04:59:07.910 --> 04:59:07.920 align:start position:0%
like interconnection costs uh economies
 
04:59:09.170 --> 04:59:09.180 align:start position:0%
of scale and that type of thing I can't
 
04:59:11.448 --> 04:59:11.458 align:start position:0%
address every single one of those but I
 
04:59:12.530 --> 04:59:12.540 align:start position:0%
do know that there are a number of
 
04:59:14.330 --> 04:59:14.340 align:start position:0%
things actively underway or have
 
04:59:16.788 --> 04:59:16.798 align:start position:0%
occurred that seek to address some of
 
04:59:19.368 --> 04:59:19.378 align:start position:0%
the issues that people have in building
 
04:59:22.190 --> 04:59:22.200 align:start position:0%
out these systems whether it's sizing up
 
04:59:23.628 --> 04:59:23.638 align:start position:0%
interconnecting that type of thing so
 
04:59:26.750 --> 04:59:26.760 align:start position:0%
for example Senate Bill 262 that was
 
04:59:29.690 --> 04:59:29.700 align:start position:0%
signed into law last year created a
 
04:59:31.610 --> 04:59:31.620 align:start position:0%
hosting capacity maps that electric
 
04:59:34.010 --> 04:59:34.020 align:start position:0%
distribution utilities I had to post on
 
04:59:35.170 --> 04:59:35.180 align:start position:0%
their website
 
04:59:39.590 --> 04:59:39.600 align:start position:0%
those Maps can help identify areas where
 
04:59:41.890 --> 04:59:41.900 align:start position:0%
facilities might be able to interconnect
 
04:59:45.708 --> 04:59:45.718 align:start position:0%
where it's it's more easier or or there
 
04:59:47.750 --> 04:59:47.760 align:start position:0%
might be need to be a significant
 
04:59:49.610 --> 04:59:49.620 align:start position:0%
infrastructure upgrades you know making
 
04:59:50.930 --> 04:59:50.940 align:start position:0%
sure that they're aware that might be
 
04:59:52.490 --> 04:59:52.500 align:start position:0%
cost prohibitive to do so here versus
 
04:59:55.368 --> 04:59:55.378 align:start position:0%
over here another element of Senate Bill
 
04:59:57.410 --> 04:59:57.420 align:start position:0%
262 last year required the department of
 
05:00:00.530 --> 05:00:00.540 align:start position:0%
energy to open up a proceeding on
 
05:00:03.170 --> 05:00:03.180 align:start position:0%
interconnection issues that
 
05:00:06.230 --> 05:00:06.240 align:start position:0%
interconnection I believe that that
 
05:00:09.410 --> 05:00:09.420 align:start position:0%
opened up in December of last year the
 
05:00:11.448 --> 05:00:11.458 align:start position:0%
department received written comment from
 
05:00:14.990 --> 05:00:15.000 align:start position:0%
the utilities as well as various other
 
05:00:16.490 --> 05:00:16.500 align:start position:0%
entities in the state such as clean
 
05:00:18.770 --> 05:00:18.780 align:start position:0%
energy New Hampshire and other renewable
 
05:00:20.770 --> 05:00:20.780 align:start position:0%
advocacy groups
 
05:00:23.208 --> 05:00:23.218 align:start position:0%
that period closed I think end of
 
05:00:25.368 --> 05:00:25.378 align:start position:0%
February I don't know the current status
 
05:00:27.410 --> 05:00:27.420 align:start position:0%
of it right now but those are just at
 
05:00:28.610 --> 05:00:28.620 align:start position:0%
least maybe some of the things that were
 
05:00:28.620 --> 05:00:30.170 align:start position:0%
least maybe some of the things that were
identified

05:00:30.170 --> 05:00:30.180 align:start position:0%
identified
 
05:00:32.030 --> 05:00:32.040 align:start position:0%
um yeah I'm going to stop I feel like
 
05:00:34.490 --> 05:00:34.500 align:start position:0%
I'm gambling I'm sorry follow-up
 
05:00:34.500 --> 05:00:35.810 align:start position:0%
I'm gambling I'm sorry follow-up
follow-up

05:00:35.810 --> 05:00:35.820 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
05:00:38.930 --> 05:00:38.940 align:start position:0%
um so is as a follow-up I mean it has
 
05:00:42.490 --> 05:00:42.500 align:start position:0%
has the department taken any action to
 
05:00:44.770 --> 05:00:44.780 align:start position:0%
apply for
 
05:00:47.448 --> 05:00:47.458 align:start position:0%
grants from you know the federal
 
05:00:50.090 --> 05:00:50.100 align:start position:0%
government under the infrastructure act
 
05:00:52.970 --> 05:00:52.980 align:start position:0%
or the the inflation reduction act to
 
05:00:55.368 --> 05:00:55.378 align:start position:0%
try to to try to secure funding to
 
05:00:57.530 --> 05:00:57.540 align:start position:0%
address some of these concerns sure so
 
05:00:58.730 --> 05:00:58.740 align:start position:0%
again thank you for the question much
 
05:01:00.410 --> 05:01:00.420 align:start position:0%
like um representative McWilliams
 
05:01:03.170 --> 05:01:03.180 align:start position:0%
question earlier today on the polls bill
 
05:01:05.208 --> 05:01:05.218 align:start position:0%
um you know it's really dependent on
 
05:01:07.070 --> 05:01:07.080 align:start position:0%
what the federal government allows for
 
05:01:08.990 --> 05:01:09.000 align:start position:0%
eligible activities under those various
 
05:01:10.730 --> 05:01:10.740 align:start position:0%
pots of funding
 
05:01:12.708 --> 05:01:12.718 align:start position:0%
um you know I think at this time we're
 
05:01:14.510 --> 05:01:14.520 align:start position:0%
largely prioritizing on those formula
 
05:01:16.550 --> 05:01:16.560 align:start position:0%
grant opportunities and then staff up to
 
05:01:17.930 --> 05:01:17.940 align:start position:0%
maybe go after some of the competitive
 
05:01:20.570 --> 05:01:20.580 align:start position:0%
opportunities I'm not aware off the top
 
05:01:23.208 --> 05:01:23.218 align:start position:0%
of my head of a specific pot of funding
 
05:01:25.550 --> 05:01:25.560 align:start position:0%
that would help address interconnection
 
05:01:27.650 --> 05:01:27.660 align:start position:0%
issues per se there's certainly money
 
05:01:30.170 --> 05:01:30.180 align:start position:0%
out there for municipalities to build
 
05:01:31.970 --> 05:01:31.980 align:start position:0%
out say renewable energy projects like
 
05:01:34.430 --> 05:01:34.440 align:start position:0%
the eecbg program but
 
05:01:36.170 --> 05:01:36.180 align:start position:0%
um regarding maybe some more of these
 
05:01:38.390 --> 05:01:38.400 align:start position:0%
technical issues I'd have to do a deeper
 
05:01:39.948 --> 05:01:39.958 align:start position:0%
dive on that
 
05:01:43.128 --> 05:01:43.138 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:46.010 --> 05:01:46.020 align:start position:0%
so I have a question for you the fiscal
 
05:01:47.868 --> 05:01:47.878 align:start position:0%
note with this bill
 
05:01:52.128 --> 05:01:52.138 align:start position:0%
says that at least 65 entities
 
05:01:55.550 --> 05:01:55.560 align:start position:0%
that are not currently eligible for net
 
05:01:57.948 --> 05:01:57.958 align:start position:0%
metering would become eligible
 
05:02:00.948 --> 05:02:00.958 align:start position:0%
under this bill
 
05:02:03.230 --> 05:02:03.240 align:start position:0%
at five megawatts each that would come
 
05:02:07.310 --> 05:02:07.320 align:start position:0%
out to like 325 megawatts
 
05:02:10.310 --> 05:02:10.320 align:start position:0%
I believe the current installed solar
 
05:02:12.170 --> 05:02:12.180 align:start position:0%
capacity in the state right now is only
 
05:02:15.110 --> 05:02:15.120 align:start position:0%
about 180 megawatts so this would more
 
05:02:16.550 --> 05:02:16.560 align:start position:0%
than double
 
05:02:16.560 --> 05:02:18.770 align:start position:0%
than double
uh

05:02:18.770 --> 05:02:18.780 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:02:21.170 --> 05:02:21.180 align:start position:0%
the amount of solar in the state
 
05:02:24.230 --> 05:02:24.240 align:start position:0%
isn't that is is that the analysis that
 
05:02:26.810 --> 05:02:26.820 align:start position:0%
the department came up with I and thank
 
05:02:28.368 --> 05:02:28.378 align:start position:0%
you for the question I can already feel
 
05:02:29.990 --> 05:02:30.000 align:start position:0%
representative Munn's queuing up a
 
05:02:32.990 --> 05:02:33.000 align:start position:0%
question for me but
 
05:02:35.448 --> 05:02:35.458 align:start position:0%
um was it I I would note that you know I
 
05:02:37.190 --> 05:02:37.200 align:start position:0%
think we identified at least six based
 
05:02:39.590 --> 05:02:39.600 align:start position:0%
on the definition of 65 I'm sorry based
 
05:02:41.330 --> 05:02:41.340 align:start position:0%
on the definition of nonprofit as
 
05:02:43.190 --> 05:02:43.200 align:start position:0%
identified in this bill there may be
 
05:02:45.530 --> 05:02:45.540 align:start position:0%
more you know depending on how you
 
05:02:47.868 --> 05:02:47.878 align:start position:0%
clarify say bona fide religious
 
05:02:47.878 --> 05:02:49.490 align:start position:0%
clarify say bona fide religious
organizations

05:02:49.490 --> 05:02:49.500 align:start position:0%
organizations
 
05:02:51.708 --> 05:02:51.718 align:start position:0%
um you know I think what we try to
 
05:02:53.930 --> 05:02:53.940 align:start position:0%
outline in the fiscal note is really
 
05:02:57.470 --> 05:02:57.480 align:start position:0%
just a general sense we cannot predict
 
05:02:59.448 --> 05:02:59.458 align:start position:0%
the future you know I've asked around we
 
05:03:01.368 --> 05:03:01.378 align:start position:0%
don't have the Oracle of Delphi camped
 
05:03:02.810 --> 05:03:02.820 align:start position:0%
around somewhere in the department of
 
05:03:05.868 --> 05:03:05.878 align:start position:0%
energy somewhere I can't predict how
 
05:03:06.948 --> 05:03:06.958 align:start position:0%
many of these entities would take
 
05:03:08.570 --> 05:03:08.580 align:start position:0%
advantage of this bill should it become
 
05:03:08.580 --> 05:03:09.948 align:start position:0%
advantage of this bill should it become
law

05:03:09.948 --> 05:03:09.958 align:start position:0%
law
 
05:03:13.128 --> 05:03:13.138 align:start position:0%
um but you know I
 
05:03:15.110 --> 05:03:15.120 align:start position:0%
I'd say I'd say there's the there's
 
05:03:16.670 --> 05:03:16.680 align:start position:0%
certainly the potential for growth of
 
05:03:18.890 --> 05:03:18.900 align:start position:0%
these systems and installed capacity
 
05:03:20.930 --> 05:03:20.940 align:start position:0%
what it would ultimately be that's
 
05:03:22.310 --> 05:03:22.320 align:start position:0%
asking me to predict the future and
 
05:03:24.350 --> 05:03:24.360 align:start position:0%
that's a little difficult I'm sorry fair
 
05:03:27.050 --> 05:03:27.060 align:start position:0%
enough I won't ask you to do that
 
05:03:31.430 --> 05:03:31.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:33.530 --> 05:03:33.540 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you oh thank you very
 
05:03:36.410 --> 05:03:36.420 align:start position:0%
much and call on the last person who has
 
05:03:39.050 --> 05:03:39.060 align:start position:0%
submitted a pink card for
 
05:03:41.570 --> 05:03:41.580 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 69 and that's the honorable
 
05:03:46.788 --> 05:03:46.798 align:start position:0%
Lee oxenham from Plainfield welcome back
 
05:03:49.190 --> 05:03:49.200 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chair decided to
 
05:03:51.650 --> 05:03:51.660 align:start position:0%
make a day of it huh I am and I should
 
05:03:53.208 --> 05:03:53.218 align:start position:0%
have identified myself as a member of
 
05:03:55.550 --> 05:03:55.560 align:start position:0%
the Plainfield energy committee
 
05:03:59.030 --> 05:03:59.040 align:start position:0%
um so two points um want to support this
 
05:04:01.730 --> 05:04:01.740 align:start position:0%
bill suggests that uh including
 
05:04:04.550 --> 05:04:04.560 align:start position:0%
nonprofits is a great idea but mostly
 
05:04:07.070 --> 05:04:07.080 align:start position:0%
interested in the the last issue that
 
05:04:09.948 --> 05:04:09.958 align:start position:0%
came up in the discussion uh prompted by
 
05:04:14.030 --> 05:04:14.040 align:start position:0%
representative McGee's query there's the
 
05:04:16.970 --> 05:04:16.980 align:start position:0%
value of distributed energy resources
 
05:04:21.350 --> 05:04:21.360 align:start position:0%
study was a key component of a previous
 
05:04:21.360 --> 05:04:22.850 align:start position:0%
study was a key component of a previous
docket

05:04:22.850 --> 05:04:22.860 align:start position:0%
docket
 
05:04:25.850 --> 05:04:25.860 align:start position:0%
along with the battery pilot that was
 
05:04:28.250 --> 05:04:28.260 align:start position:0%
undertaken by Liberty Utilities this was
 
05:04:32.090 --> 05:04:32.100 align:start position:0%
to give us real data about real
 
05:04:35.510 --> 05:04:35.520 align:start position:0%
circumstances in New Hampshire having to
 
05:04:38.448 --> 05:04:38.458 align:start position:0%
do with the Tariff for net metering was
 
05:04:40.430 --> 05:04:40.440 align:start position:0%
there in fact cost shifting this has
 
05:04:42.948 --> 05:04:42.958 align:start position:0%
been an overriding issue for the whole
 
05:04:45.190 --> 05:04:45.200 align:start position:0%
entire six years I was on this committee
 
05:04:48.470 --> 05:04:48.480 align:start position:0%
this study has answered the question
 
05:04:51.590 --> 05:04:51.600 align:start position:0%
there is an insignificant
 
05:04:55.310 --> 05:04:55.320 align:start position:0%
cost shift of roughly one percent when
 
05:04:57.288 --> 05:04:57.298 align:start position:0%
you take into account the criteria
 
05:05:01.670 --> 05:05:01.680 align:start position:0%
listed if you go to the dunski study
 
05:05:04.490 --> 05:05:04.500 align:start position:0%
it lists many of the things which are
 
05:05:06.890 --> 05:05:06.900 align:start position:0%
not included and if they were included
 
05:05:10.610 --> 05:05:10.620 align:start position:0%
would shift that one percent to possibly
 
05:05:13.310 --> 05:05:13.320 align:start position:0%
a 20 percent cost shift in the opposite
 
05:05:16.190 --> 05:05:16.200 align:start position:0%
direction that people who have invested
 
05:05:19.788 --> 05:05:19.798 align:start position:0%
have taken this incentive to put private
 
05:05:21.470 --> 05:05:21.480 align:start position:0%
investment into creating renewable
 
05:05:24.650 --> 05:05:24.660 align:start position:0%
energy create benefits that redown to
 
05:05:27.470 --> 05:05:27.480 align:start position:0%
the entire system to the entire grid
 
05:05:30.650 --> 05:05:30.660 align:start position:0%
that benefit everyone and the cost shift
 
05:05:35.270 --> 05:05:35.280 align:start position:0%
is from them to the general ratepayer
 
05:05:37.730 --> 05:05:37.740 align:start position:0%
representative McGee's specific question
 
05:05:39.288 --> 05:05:39.298 align:start position:0%
had to do with isn't there a difference
 
05:05:42.170 --> 05:05:42.180 align:start position:0%
between who is included in the net
 
05:05:44.690 --> 05:05:44.700 align:start position:0%
metering tariff and what the net
 
05:05:47.270 --> 05:05:47.280 align:start position:0%
metering tariff is the current docket
 
05:05:49.430 --> 05:05:49.440 align:start position:0%
that has only just opened and if anybody
 
05:05:50.868 --> 05:05:50.878 align:start position:0%
thinks it's going to be done in a year
 
05:05:53.650 --> 05:05:53.660 align:start position:0%
I've got a bridge in Brooklyn for you
 
05:05:57.230 --> 05:05:57.240 align:start position:0%
that is going to look at what should the
 
05:05:58.550 --> 05:05:58.560 align:start position:0%
Tariff be
 
05:06:00.770 --> 05:06:00.780 align:start position:0%
what are those advantages that are
 
05:06:02.750 --> 05:06:02.760 align:start position:0%
redowned to the entire system what are
 
05:06:05.208 --> 05:06:05.218 align:start position:0%
the costs to the entire system what is
 
05:06:08.288 --> 05:06:08.298 align:start position:0%
the fair and Equitable reasonable tariff
 
05:06:11.990 --> 05:06:12.000 align:start position:0%
that compensates people adequately and
 
05:06:15.050 --> 05:06:15.060 align:start position:0%
fairly that is gives no advantages that
 
05:06:16.730 --> 05:06:16.740 align:start position:0%
is the current docket that has just
 
05:06:20.090 --> 05:06:20.100 align:start position:0%
opened the value of distributed energy
 
05:06:23.448 --> 05:06:23.458 align:start position:0%
resources has established the base point
 
05:06:26.090 --> 05:06:26.100 align:start position:0%
that we currently have if you look at
 
05:06:28.550 --> 05:06:28.560 align:start position:0%
these enumerated criteria
 
05:06:31.490 --> 05:06:31.500 align:start position:0%
a one percent cost shift which everyone
 
05:06:31.500 --> 05:06:32.830 align:start position:0%
a one percent cost shift which everyone
agrees

05:06:32.830 --> 05:06:32.840 align:start position:0%
agrees
 
05:06:36.948 --> 05:06:36.958 align:start position:0%
is agreed is a relatively insignificant
 
05:06:38.750 --> 05:06:38.760 align:start position:0%
number it has been suggested by the
 
05:06:40.610 --> 05:06:40.620 align:start position:0%
chair that ah but in the future it could
 
05:06:42.770 --> 05:06:42.780 align:start position:0%
be different yes many things could be
 
05:06:45.010 --> 05:06:45.020 align:start position:0%
different in the future however
 
05:06:48.590 --> 05:06:48.600 align:start position:0%
the best we can do at hand is to use
 
05:06:50.990 --> 05:06:51.000 align:start position:0%
what we have created with painstaking
 
05:06:54.170 --> 05:06:54.180 align:start position:0%
care over the last six years this data
 
05:06:57.350 --> 05:06:57.360 align:start position:0%
set and use this data set to come up
 
05:06:59.750 --> 05:06:59.760 align:start position:0%
with a fair representation
 
05:07:01.730 --> 05:07:01.740 align:start position:0%
that doesn't mean we should stop looking
 
05:07:05.930 --> 05:07:05.940 align:start position:0%
at who should qualify to utilize net
 
05:07:08.570 --> 05:07:08.580 align:start position:0%
metering rates which is the the bulk of
 
05:07:09.770 --> 05:07:09.780 align:start position:0%
the bills today
 
05:07:11.990 --> 05:07:12.000 align:start position:0%
they don't need to be held up the way we
 
05:07:13.788 --> 05:07:13.798 align:start position:0%
held up things for the last six years
 
05:07:16.368 --> 05:07:16.378 align:start position:0%
while we were waiting to know whether
 
05:07:18.650 --> 05:07:18.660 align:start position:0%
there was a significant cost shift or
 
05:07:18.660 --> 05:07:19.430 align:start position:0%
there was a significant cost shift or
not

05:07:19.430 --> 05:07:19.440 align:start position:0%
not
 
05:07:21.948 --> 05:07:21.958 align:start position:0%
we know there isn't one we know that
 
05:07:23.868 --> 05:07:23.878 align:start position:0%
under current circumstances there isn't
 
05:07:23.878 --> 05:07:25.970 align:start position:0%
under current circumstances there isn't
one

05:07:25.970 --> 05:07:25.980 align:start position:0%
one
 
05:07:29.390 --> 05:07:29.400 align:start position:0%
so I just want to be very clear that the
 
05:07:32.208 --> 05:07:32.218 align:start position:0%
new docket is about setting possibly
 
05:07:34.490 --> 05:07:34.500 align:start position:0%
changing the net median rate
 
05:07:36.530 --> 05:07:36.540 align:start position:0%
remember we currently are operating
 
05:07:38.810 --> 05:07:38.820 align:start position:0%
under an alternative net metering rate
 
05:07:40.850 --> 05:07:40.860 align:start position:0%
that is an interim rate because we
 
05:07:42.948 --> 05:07:42.958 align:start position:0%
didn't know if the rate originally
 
05:07:45.770 --> 05:07:45.780 align:start position:0%
established which was a one-to-one was
 
05:07:48.470 --> 05:07:48.480 align:start position:0%
fair and adequate compensation
 
05:07:51.770 --> 05:07:51.780 align:start position:0%
so we could go back to that rate we
 
05:07:54.050 --> 05:07:54.060 align:start position:0%
could continue the alternative we could
 
05:07:56.030 --> 05:07:56.040 align:start position:0%
come up with an entirely new net
 
05:07:58.190 --> 05:07:58.200 align:start position:0%
metering rate that is what the new
 
05:08:00.230 --> 05:08:00.240 align:start position:0%
docket is about it is not about
 
05:08:03.288 --> 05:08:03.298 align:start position:0%
establishing the value of solar in New
 
05:08:03.298 --> 05:08:04.670 align:start position:0%
establishing the value of solar in New
Hampshire

05:08:04.670 --> 05:08:04.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
05:08:07.128 --> 05:08:07.138 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:08:09.470 --> 05:08:09.480 align:start position:0%
thank you questions for
 
05:08:12.770 --> 05:08:12.780 align:start position:0%
former representative oxenham
 
05:08:15.288 --> 05:08:15.298 align:start position:0%
so did I understand you to say that we
 
05:08:17.690 --> 05:08:17.700 align:start position:0%
need to rely on studies
 
05:08:19.850 --> 05:08:19.860 align:start position:0%
as someone who worked for 10 years at
 
05:08:21.650 --> 05:08:21.660 align:start position:0%
the National Academy of Sciences as an
 
05:08:24.830 --> 05:08:24.840 align:start position:0%
economic analyst yes I rely on studies
 
05:08:28.310 --> 05:08:28.320 align:start position:0%
that is science that is our best way of
 
05:08:30.650 --> 05:08:30.660 align:start position:0%
understanding the world we live in
 
05:08:33.830 --> 05:08:33.840 align:start position:0%
okay so the study that says that as the
 
05:08:35.990 --> 05:08:36.000 align:start position:0%
penetration of distributed energy
 
05:08:39.230 --> 05:08:39.240 align:start position:0%
resources goes up the percentage of cost
 
05:08:41.750 --> 05:08:41.760 align:start position:0%
shifting goes up is a study we should
 
05:08:43.610 --> 05:08:43.620 align:start position:0%
also rely on then
 
05:08:46.190 --> 05:08:46.200 align:start position:0%
I would suggest that a single study with
 
05:08:50.030 --> 05:08:50.040 align:start position:0%
that conclusion needs to be looked at I
 
05:08:53.150 --> 05:08:53.160 align:start position:0%
have before me the meta study by The
 
05:08:55.610 --> 05:08:55.620 align:start position:0%
Institute for energy Innovation which
 
05:08:58.010 --> 05:08:58.020 align:start position:0%
says that when you look at the numerous
 
05:08:59.510 --> 05:08:59.520 align:start position:0%
studies that have been performed over
 
05:09:02.030 --> 05:09:02.040 align:start position:0%
the last decade the preponderance them
 
05:09:05.208 --> 05:09:05.218 align:start position:0%
says clearly that uh
 
05:09:07.128 --> 05:09:07.138 align:start position:0%
the economic benefits of net metering
 
05:09:09.050 --> 05:09:09.060 align:start position:0%
outweigh the cost to the utility and
 
05:09:10.910 --> 05:09:10.920 align:start position:0%
rather than imposing a net cost net
 
05:09:13.270 --> 05:09:13.280 align:start position:0%
metering in most cases a net benefit
 
05:09:16.970 --> 05:09:16.980 align:start position:0%
with increasing amounts we're we're in
 
05:09:18.830 --> 05:09:18.840 align:start position:0%
new ground and I would suggest that if
 
05:09:22.850 --> 05:09:22.860 align:start position:0%
we get to 20 penetration 50 penetration
 
05:09:27.288 --> 05:09:27.298 align:start position:0%
this will need to be uh Revisited
 
05:09:30.890 --> 05:09:30.900 align:start position:0%
okay thank you questions for the former
 
05:09:30.900 --> 05:09:33.410 align:start position:0%
okay thank you questions for the former
representative

05:09:33.410 --> 05:09:33.420 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:09:35.690 --> 05:09:35.700 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you thank you for
 
05:09:38.690 --> 05:09:38.700 align:start position:0%
being here to testify on this bill
 
05:09:41.150 --> 05:09:41.160 align:start position:0%
and since I have no more pink cards for
 
05:09:43.010 --> 05:09:43.020 align:start position:0%
this bill I'm going to close the public
 
05:09:45.530 --> 05:09:45.540 align:start position:0%
hearing on Senate bill
 
05:09:49.610 --> 05:09:49.620 align:start position:0%
69 and now we will resume the public
 
05:09:52.208 --> 05:09:52.218 align:start position:0%
hearing on Senate bill
 
05:09:52.218 --> 05:09:54.170 align:start position:0%
hearing on Senate bill
79.

05:09:54.170 --> 05:09:54.180 align:start position:0%
79.
 
05:10:00.230 --> 05:10:00.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:01.670 --> 05:10:01.680 align:start position:0%
and I have
 
05:10:03.948 --> 05:10:03.958 align:start position:0%
three pink cards here so the first
 
05:10:06.650 --> 05:10:06.660 align:start position:0%
person I'll call on is Griffin Roberge
 
05:10:18.890 --> 05:10:18.900 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:20.750 --> 05:10:20.760 align:start position:0%
thank you members of the committee uh
 
05:10:23.030 --> 05:10:23.040 align:start position:0%
again Griffin Roberge Synergy program
 
05:10:26.150 --> 05:10:26.160 align:start position:0%
manager at the department of energy
 
05:10:26.160 --> 05:10:26.930 align:start position:0%
manager at the department of energy
um

05:10:26.930 --> 05:10:26.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:10:29.628 --> 05:10:29.638 align:start position:0%
Department as opposed sent Bill 79 as
 
05:10:31.670 --> 05:10:31.680 align:start position:0%
amended by the Senate
 
05:10:34.690 --> 05:10:34.700 align:start position:0%
um going through the bill
 
05:10:38.750 --> 05:10:38.760 align:start position:0%
section one of the bill
 
05:10:40.610 --> 05:10:40.620 align:start position:0%
um repeals and reenacts the definition
 
05:10:43.610 --> 05:10:43.620 align:start position:0%
of customer generator
 
05:10:46.550 --> 05:10:46.560 align:start position:0%
um inserting a provision regarding an
 
05:10:49.330 --> 05:10:49.340 align:start position:0%
industrial host on line seven
 
05:10:51.830 --> 05:10:51.840 align:start position:0%
section two
 
05:10:54.170 --> 05:10:54.180 align:start position:0%
further down on line 12 or I should say
 
05:10:56.990 --> 05:10:57.000 align:start position:0%
14 sorry creates the definition of
 
05:10:58.788 --> 05:10:58.798 align:start position:0%
industrial host and this language again
 
05:11:00.890 --> 05:11:00.900 align:start position:0%
largely emulates uh kind of what we saw
 
05:11:02.570 --> 05:11:02.580 align:start position:0%
with the municipal host statute and the
 
05:11:05.270 --> 05:11:05.280 align:start position:0%
non-profit Bill beforehand the language
 
05:11:07.190 --> 05:11:07.200 align:start position:0%
defines that host as a customer
 
05:11:08.690 --> 05:11:08.700 align:start position:0%
generator of greater than one megawatt
 
05:11:11.090 --> 05:11:11.100 align:start position:0%
less than five that is used to offset
 
05:11:12.650 --> 05:11:12.660 align:start position:0%
the electricity requirements of a group
 
05:11:14.810 --> 05:11:14.820 align:start position:0%
consisting entirely of one commercial
 
05:11:17.090 --> 05:11:17.100 align:start position:0%
industrial or institutional entity with
 
05:11:18.708 --> 05:11:18.718 align:start position:0%
one or more accounts provide that
 
05:11:19.550 --> 05:11:19.560 align:start position:0%
they're all in the same service
 
05:11:22.250 --> 05:11:22.260 align:start position:0%
territory and then a host may be either
 
05:11:24.770 --> 05:11:24.780 align:start position:0%
publicly or privately owned and in no
 
05:11:26.628 --> 05:11:26.638 align:start position:0%
instance shall the electricity
 
05:11:29.330 --> 05:11:29.340 align:start position:0%
generating facility exceed 100 of the
 
05:11:31.670 --> 05:11:31.680 align:start position:0%
industrial hosts average electric
 
05:11:34.190 --> 05:11:34.200 align:start position:0%
consumption over the 12 months
 
05:11:37.490 --> 05:11:37.500 align:start position:0%
um Department opposes this bill for a
 
05:11:39.770 --> 05:11:39.780 align:start position:0%
number of reasons looking at the
 
05:11:41.750 --> 05:11:41.760 align:start position:0%
technical language of the bill section
 
05:11:43.550 --> 05:11:43.560 align:start position:0%
one as I mentioned
 
05:11:43.560 --> 05:11:44.510 align:start position:0%
one as I mentioned
um

05:11:44.510 --> 05:11:44.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:11:46.788 --> 05:11:46.798 align:start position:0%
repeals and reenacts the definition of
 
05:11:49.850 --> 05:11:49.860 align:start position:0%
customer generator there are really two
 
05:11:52.010 --> 05:11:52.020 align:start position:0%
significant changes here is one adds the
 
05:11:54.050 --> 05:11:54.060 align:start position:0%
definition or as a reference to
 
05:11:56.628 --> 05:11:56.638 align:start position:0%
Industrial host on line seven but most
 
05:11:58.670 --> 05:11:58.680 align:start position:0%
notably it also removes the current one
 
05:12:01.550 --> 05:12:01.560 align:start position:0%
megawatt cap in the customer generator
 
05:12:04.788 --> 05:12:04.798 align:start position:0%
statute entirely so hypothetically there
 
05:12:06.830 --> 05:12:06.840 align:start position:0%
is no limit on net metering anymore for
 
05:12:08.750 --> 05:12:08.760 align:start position:0%
customer generators aside from those a
 
05:12:10.910 --> 05:12:10.920 align:start position:0%
municipal host or industrial host
 
05:12:10.920 --> 05:12:12.550 align:start position:0%
municipal host or industrial host
Arrangements

05:12:12.550 --> 05:12:12.560 align:start position:0%
Arrangements
 
05:12:15.770 --> 05:12:15.780 align:start position:0%
section two also requires that the
 
05:12:18.890 --> 05:12:18.900 align:start position:0%
electricity generating facility there on
 
05:12:18.900 --> 05:12:20.090 align:start position:0%
electricity generating facility there on
lines

05:12:20.090 --> 05:12:20.100 align:start position:0%
lines
 
05:12:22.448 --> 05:12:22.458 align:start position:0%
18 and 19
 
05:12:24.770 --> 05:12:24.780 align:start position:0%
shall not exceed the industrial host
 
05:12:26.510 --> 05:12:26.520 align:start position:0%
average electric consumption over the
 
05:12:28.310 --> 05:12:28.320 align:start position:0%
past 12 months this is a language that
 
05:12:29.750 --> 05:12:29.760 align:start position:0%
might seem a little familiar to those
 
05:12:31.510 --> 05:12:31.520 align:start position:0%
who are around last year on Senate Bill
 
05:12:33.830 --> 05:12:33.840 align:start position:0%
262 that this committee ultimately
 
05:12:36.050 --> 05:12:36.060 align:start position:0%
removed the department again raises
 
05:12:37.730 --> 05:12:37.740 align:start position:0%
concerns as we did on that bill with
 
05:12:40.850 --> 05:12:40.860 align:start position:0%
what occurs if that facilities if that
 
05:12:42.530 --> 05:12:42.540 align:start position:0%
customer's average electric consumption
 
05:12:44.990 --> 05:12:45.000 align:start position:0%
drops over that 12-month period as I
 
05:12:46.550 --> 05:12:46.560 align:start position:0%
think we're all aware
 
05:12:48.170 --> 05:12:48.180 align:start position:0%
there could be things like a pandemic
 
05:12:50.330 --> 05:12:50.340 align:start position:0%
that occurs that can significantly
 
05:12:51.770 --> 05:12:51.780 align:start position:0%
Alters the electric consumption for
 
05:12:56.030 --> 05:12:56.040 align:start position:0%
utilities who monitors that facilities
 
05:12:58.910 --> 05:12:58.920 align:start position:0%
average electric consumption who does
 
05:13:01.128 --> 05:13:01.138 align:start position:0%
the system become deactivated if it goes
 
05:13:03.050 --> 05:13:03.060 align:start position:0%
over this threshold
 
05:13:05.628 --> 05:13:05.638 align:start position:0%
um again some further Clarity there I
 
05:13:07.490 --> 05:13:07.500 align:start position:0%
think would be welcomed
 
05:13:07.500 --> 05:13:08.150 align:start position:0%
think would be welcomed
um

05:13:08.150 --> 05:13:08.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:13:10.670 --> 05:13:10.680 align:start position:0%
also in the industrial host uh statue
 
05:13:12.170 --> 05:13:12.180 align:start position:0%
that is a little bit unclear as to what
 
05:13:14.510 --> 05:13:14.520 align:start position:0%
a commercial industrial or institutional
 
05:13:16.850 --> 05:13:16.860 align:start position:0%
entity is
 
05:13:19.010 --> 05:13:19.020 align:start position:0%
um another point is as I raised on
 
05:13:21.650 --> 05:13:21.660 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 69 uh the Senate did not
 
05:13:23.930 --> 05:13:23.940 align:start position:0%
amend either this bill or Senate Bill 69
 
05:13:25.788 --> 05:13:25.798 align:start position:0%
to address conflicting language between
 
05:13:29.330 --> 05:13:29.340 align:start position:0%
both bills again for again both bills
 
05:13:32.990 --> 05:13:33.000 align:start position:0%
seek to create a new paragraph 2G to the
 
05:13:34.850 --> 05:13:34.860 align:start position:0%
extent that these bills pass and become
 
05:13:37.070 --> 05:13:37.080 align:start position:0%
law one bill again could potentially
 
05:13:38.570 --> 05:13:38.580 align:start position:0%
override the other and create
 
05:13:40.670 --> 05:13:40.680 align:start position:0%
significant inconsistencies in New
 
05:13:43.390 --> 05:13:43.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's net metering statutes
 
05:13:46.190 --> 05:13:46.200 align:start position:0%
and finally I do want to note that
 
05:13:48.410 --> 05:13:48.420 align:start position:0%
there's really nothing in State Statute
 
05:13:50.330 --> 05:13:50.340 align:start position:0%
that prevents private companies from
 
05:13:51.948 --> 05:13:51.958 align:start position:0%
constructing their own generating
 
05:13:53.690 --> 05:13:53.700 align:start position:0%
facilities above the current one
 
05:13:56.390 --> 05:13:56.400 align:start position:0%
megawatt cap if they choose to do so
 
05:13:58.250 --> 05:13:58.260 align:start position:0%
private companies would not be
 
05:14:00.350 --> 05:14:00.360 align:start position:0%
compensated for their excess generation
 
05:14:02.570 --> 05:14:02.580 align:start position:0%
at the current net metering tariffs but
 
05:14:04.310 --> 05:14:04.320 align:start position:0%
would be compensated wholesale power
 
05:14:07.128 --> 05:14:07.138 align:start position:0%
rates it remains a policy question I
 
05:14:08.930 --> 05:14:08.940 align:start position:0%
it's something that you know we want to
 
05:14:10.368 --> 05:14:10.378 align:start position:0%
raise it's a policy question as to
 
05:14:11.750 --> 05:14:11.760 align:start position:0%
whether private entities should be
 
05:14:14.390 --> 05:14:14.400 align:start position:0%
entitled to a faster rate of return on
 
05:14:16.730 --> 05:14:16.740 align:start position:0%
their Investments at the expense of
 
05:14:19.730 --> 05:14:19.740 align:start position:0%
non-distributed generation customers
 
05:14:19.740 --> 05:14:20.770 align:start position:0%
non-distributed generation customers
um

05:14:20.770 --> 05:14:20.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:14:23.448 --> 05:14:23.458 align:start position:0%
regarding that that closes out my
 
05:14:25.430 --> 05:14:25.440 align:start position:0%
testimony on this bill and I'm happy to
 
05:14:28.490 --> 05:14:28.500 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:30.948 --> 05:14:30.958 align:start position:0%
thank you questions for Mr brobarge on
 
05:14:34.070 --> 05:14:34.080 align:start position:0%
Senate bill 79.
 
05:14:36.110 --> 05:14:36.120 align:start position:0%
representative McGee
 
05:14:38.690 --> 05:14:38.700 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you Mr
 
05:14:40.368 --> 05:14:40.378 align:start position:0%
robish thank you
 
05:14:42.530 --> 05:14:42.540 align:start position:0%
um so we've been discussing several
 
05:14:45.590 --> 05:14:45.600 align:start position:0%
times this morning the open docket for
 
05:14:47.690 --> 05:14:47.700 align:start position:0%
review of the current existing net
 
05:14:51.410 --> 05:14:51.420 align:start position:0%
metering tariff yep but if there is
 
05:14:53.868 --> 05:14:53.878 align:start position:0%
um an existing tariff saying what net
 
05:14:56.930 --> 05:14:56.940 align:start position:0%
metering should cost or or is valued at
 
05:15:00.170 --> 05:15:00.180 align:start position:0%
let's say then why wouldn't someone who
 
05:15:00.180 --> 05:15:01.448 align:start position:0%
let's say then why wouldn't someone who
is

05:15:01.448 --> 05:15:01.458 align:start position:0%
is
 
05:15:04.250 --> 05:15:04.260 align:start position:0%
producing that energy in your mind be
 
05:15:06.170 --> 05:15:06.180 align:start position:0%
eligible for that
 
05:15:08.090 --> 05:15:08.100 align:start position:0%
recompense in other words why should
 
05:15:09.948 --> 05:15:09.958 align:start position:0%
they be making less
 
05:15:12.410 --> 05:15:12.420 align:start position:0%
if they're if they're generating energy
 
05:15:14.030 --> 05:15:14.040 align:start position:0%
that other people can benefit from oh no
 
05:15:16.190 --> 05:15:16.200 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question so I what I
 
05:15:18.470 --> 05:15:18.480 align:start position:0%
mean to say is that you know there are a
 
05:15:20.090 --> 05:15:20.100 align:start position:0%
lot of arguments about increasing the
 
05:15:23.330 --> 05:15:23.340 align:start position:0%
met the megawatt cap to five megawatts
 
05:15:25.368 --> 05:15:25.378 align:start position:0%
there is nothing preventing entities
 
05:15:28.070 --> 05:15:28.080 align:start position:0%
from doing so uh private companies from
 
05:15:29.990 --> 05:15:30.000 align:start position:0%
doing so if you go above the one
 
05:15:32.628 --> 05:15:32.638 align:start position:0%
megawatt cap however you will be those
 
05:15:35.810 --> 05:15:35.820 align:start position:0%
entities will be reimbursed or paid back
 
05:15:38.750 --> 05:15:38.760 align:start position:0%
at wholesale power rates it's not going
 
05:15:40.368 --> 05:15:40.378 align:start position:0%
to be at the net metering tariff that's
 
05:15:42.050 --> 05:15:42.060 align:start position:0%
currently in existence for those below
 
05:15:43.550 --> 05:15:43.560 align:start position:0%
one megawatt
 
05:15:46.490 --> 05:15:46.500 align:start position:0%
um I I just wanted to note that that I
 
05:15:47.810 --> 05:15:47.820 align:start position:0%
don't want people getting confused is
 
05:15:49.368 --> 05:15:49.378 align:start position:0%
that you know there's something
 
05:15:52.430 --> 05:15:52.440 align:start position:0%
preventing these facilities uh from
 
05:15:54.410 --> 05:15:54.420 align:start position:0%
going above the one megawatt cap you
 
05:15:57.230 --> 05:15:57.240 align:start position:0%
just alter the level of compensation
 
05:15:59.390 --> 05:15:59.400 align:start position:0%
that you get for that power that you put
 
05:16:01.490 --> 05:16:01.500 align:start position:0%
back onto the grid
 
05:16:04.490 --> 05:16:04.500 align:start position:0%
may I follow up of course but I think
 
05:16:06.350 --> 05:16:06.360 align:start position:0%
you you're taking it back off sort of
 
05:16:08.810 --> 05:16:08.820 align:start position:0%
the questions my point was what we've
 
05:16:10.430 --> 05:16:10.440 align:start position:0%
been hearing from folks today is that
 
05:16:11.750 --> 05:16:11.760 align:start position:0%
they're trying to figure out how to make
 
05:16:15.350 --> 05:16:15.360 align:start position:0%
projects economical and I think the the
 
05:16:17.208 --> 05:16:17.218 align:start position:0%
fact that people are trying to be able
 
05:16:19.610 --> 05:16:19.620 align:start position:0%
to scale the projects to get those
 
05:16:21.948 --> 05:16:21.958 align:start position:0%
economies of scale and also be
 
05:16:24.050 --> 05:16:24.060 align:start position:0%
compensated for the scale of the energy
 
05:16:26.030 --> 05:16:26.040 align:start position:0%
they're producing that I mean I think
 
05:16:27.288 --> 05:16:27.298 align:start position:0%
that's what these bills are trying to
 
05:16:28.430 --> 05:16:28.440 align:start position:0%
get at is to give people that
 
05:16:30.670 --> 05:16:30.680 align:start position:0%
opportunity in these different slivers
 
05:16:33.288 --> 05:16:33.298 align:start position:0%
and in this case in in the commercial
 
05:16:36.170 --> 05:16:36.180 align:start position:0%
and Industrial sliver
 
05:16:37.970 --> 05:16:37.980 align:start position:0%
um so I think
 
05:16:39.948 --> 05:16:39.958 align:start position:0%
is there a question there I think what
 
05:16:41.868 --> 05:16:41.878 align:start position:0%
you're what you're what I hear you
 
05:16:45.230 --> 05:16:45.240 align:start position:0%
saying is that there they shouldn't be
 
05:16:47.270 --> 05:16:47.280 align:start position:0%
compensated at the same rate they can do
 
05:16:49.368 --> 05:16:49.378 align:start position:0%
it if they want to but isn't that the
 
05:16:51.110 --> 05:16:51.120 align:start position:0%
whole point of the bill is to try and
 
05:16:53.510 --> 05:16:53.520 align:start position:0%
make sure that they can sure yeah yeah
 
05:16:55.788 --> 05:16:55.798 align:start position:0%
because the economies work I I agree
 
05:16:57.590 --> 05:16:57.600 align:start position:0%
that's the intent of the bill but you
 
05:16:59.510 --> 05:16:59.520 align:start position:0%
know I would respectfully submit there
 
05:17:01.730 --> 05:17:01.740 align:start position:0%
has been discussion here today that the
 
05:17:04.430 --> 05:17:04.440 align:start position:0%
uh vder study found no evidence of cost
 
05:17:07.070 --> 05:17:07.080 align:start position:0%
Chef last I checked zero percent is not
 
05:17:10.850 --> 05:17:10.860 align:start position:0%
one percent there there is a cost shift
 
05:17:14.570 --> 05:17:14.580 align:start position:0%
um whether or not we want to expand the
 
05:17:17.330 --> 05:17:17.340 align:start position:0%
cap to five megawatts and
 
05:17:19.310 --> 05:17:19.320 align:start position:0%
I understand the argument to achieve
 
05:17:21.350 --> 05:17:21.360 align:start position:0%
economies of scale but somebody pays
 
05:17:25.190 --> 05:17:25.200 align:start position:0%
back for that uh excess generation and
 
05:17:26.690 --> 05:17:26.700 align:start position:0%
whether or not
 
05:17:28.670 --> 05:17:28.680 align:start position:0%
um you know policy makers want to make
 
05:17:30.230 --> 05:17:30.240 align:start position:0%
it the preference that non-distributed
 
05:17:32.330 --> 05:17:32.340 align:start position:0%
generation customers pay that that's
 
05:17:34.610 --> 05:17:34.620 align:start position:0%
obviously a policy call but it is one
 
05:17:36.650 --> 05:17:36.660 align:start position:0%
that we would respectfully submit play
 
05:17:38.270 --> 05:17:38.280 align:start position:0%
out through the adjudicative process
 
05:17:40.310 --> 05:17:40.320 align:start position:0%
before making sizable changes to the net
 
05:17:43.250 --> 05:17:43.260 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:46.850 --> 05:17:46.860 align:start position:0%
did the vder study did not find a range
 
05:17:49.490 --> 05:17:49.500 align:start position:0%
for cost shifting that started at one
 
05:17:51.530 --> 05:17:51.540 align:start position:0%
percent and went as high as 2.9 percent
 
05:17:54.470 --> 05:17:54.480 align:start position:0%
for industrial classes in the unitel
 
05:17:56.150 --> 05:17:56.160 align:start position:0%
service territory thank you for the
 
05:17:58.190 --> 05:17:58.200 align:start position:0%
question so yes I would submit that
 
05:18:01.310 --> 05:18:01.320 align:start position:0%
based on the study it did vary granted
 
05:18:05.510 --> 05:18:05.520 align:start position:0%
one percent is an estimate but it did
 
05:18:08.208 --> 05:18:08.218 align:start position:0%
vary based on the type of type of
 
05:18:09.530 --> 05:18:09.540 align:start position:0%
customer class you're looking at whether
 
05:18:11.270 --> 05:18:11.280 align:start position:0%
that's residential small commercial
 
05:18:13.730 --> 05:18:13.740 align:start position:0%
large commercial yes
 
05:18:16.070 --> 05:18:16.080 align:start position:0%
and it also broke down based on utility
 
05:18:17.990 --> 05:18:18.000 align:start position:0%
I believe as well
 
05:18:19.190 --> 05:18:19.200 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:18:20.990 --> 05:18:21.000 align:start position:0%
representative Munn says a question
 
05:18:22.730 --> 05:18:22.740 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:18:24.590 --> 05:18:24.600 align:start position:0%
um and thank you again for taking my
 
05:18:24.600 --> 05:18:25.730 align:start position:0%
um and thank you again for taking my
question

05:18:25.730 --> 05:18:25.740 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:18:28.850 --> 05:18:28.860 align:start position:0%
um I'm glad you caught the the the thing
 
05:18:30.708 --> 05:18:30.718 align:start position:0%
about the one megawatt
 
05:18:32.510 --> 05:18:32.520 align:start position:0%
um limit because I had noticed that as
 
05:18:35.208 --> 05:18:35.218 align:start position:0%
well and I was just curious whether you
 
05:18:37.970 --> 05:18:37.980 align:start position:0%
had had any conversation with the Bill's
 
05:18:40.070 --> 05:18:40.080 align:start position:0%
sponsor to
 
05:18:42.288 --> 05:18:42.298 align:start position:0%
you know shed some light on whether that
 
05:18:44.448 --> 05:18:44.458 align:start position:0%
was deliberate or just an oversight sure
 
05:18:46.430 --> 05:18:46.440 align:start position:0%
I I don't want to speak for the Bill's
 
05:18:49.490 --> 05:18:49.500 align:start position:0%
sponsor but I do recall that uh our
 
05:18:51.110 --> 05:18:51.120 align:start position:0%
policy and programs division director
 
05:18:52.610 --> 05:18:52.620 align:start position:0%
Josh Elliott testified at that hearing
 
05:18:53.990 --> 05:18:54.000 align:start position:0%
we were in opposition to the bill at the
 
05:18:54.000 --> 05:18:55.190 align:start position:0%
we were in opposition to the bill at the
hearing

05:18:55.190 --> 05:18:55.200 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
05:18:57.170 --> 05:18:57.180 align:start position:0%
um but as I recall there was an
 
05:18:58.550 --> 05:18:58.560 align:start position:0%
amendment thrown out at the last second
 
05:19:00.830 --> 05:19:00.840 align:start position:0%
and the committee asked I think Josh
 
05:19:02.330 --> 05:19:02.340 align:start position:0%
Elliott right there in the room you know
 
05:19:04.070 --> 05:19:04.080 align:start position:0%
what's your feedback
 
05:19:06.110 --> 05:19:06.120 align:start position:0%
I don't think at that point where we
 
05:19:07.550 --> 05:19:07.560 align:start position:0%
could digest it in a matter of seconds
 
05:19:09.530 --> 05:19:09.540 align:start position:0%
and say you know this is we could give
 
05:19:12.350 --> 05:19:12.360 align:start position:0%
constructive feedback but um the senate
 
05:19:14.330 --> 05:19:14.340 align:start position:0%
committee at that time decided to move
 
05:19:16.910 --> 05:19:16.920 align:start position:0%
along the bill as amended I couldn't
 
05:19:20.510 --> 05:19:20.520 align:start position:0%
speak as to the the prime sponsors um
 
05:19:22.128 --> 05:19:22.138 align:start position:0%
reasoning for that or if that was just
 
05:19:27.530 --> 05:19:27.540 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:29.810 --> 05:19:29.820 align:start position:0%
okay seeing no further questions we'll
 
05:19:31.970 --> 05:19:31.980 align:start position:0%
move right along thank you and then I'll
 
05:19:36.470 --> 05:19:36.480 align:start position:0%
ask Bill Lundgren of Stonyfield yogurt
 
05:19:38.628 --> 05:19:38.638 align:start position:0%
to come speak to us about his
 
05:19:41.150 --> 05:19:41.160 align:start position:0%
perspective on this legislation oops
 
05:19:43.550 --> 05:19:43.560 align:start position:0%
it's not a he it's Brit I'm sorry I
 
05:19:44.810 --> 05:19:44.820 align:start position:0%
misread that
 
05:19:46.250 --> 05:19:46.260 align:start position:0%
sorry Brit
 
05:19:53.448 --> 05:19:53.458 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:55.310 --> 05:19:55.320 align:start position:0%
hi thanks so much for having me here
 
05:19:58.490 --> 05:19:58.500 align:start position:0%
today my name is Brit Lundgren I am the
 
05:20:00.890 --> 05:20:00.900 align:start position:0%
senior director of sustainability and
 
05:20:03.948 --> 05:20:03.958 align:start position:0%
government Affairs at Stonyfield
 
05:20:06.230 --> 05:20:06.240 align:start position:0%
Stoney field is as many of you probably
 
05:20:09.410 --> 05:20:09.420 align:start position:0%
know an organic Yogurt Company based in
 
05:20:12.410 --> 05:20:12.420 align:start position:0%
Londonderry New Hampshire and I'm here
 
05:20:14.510 --> 05:20:14.520 align:start position:0%
to register our strong support for
 
05:20:17.868 --> 05:20:17.878 align:start position:0%
Senate bill 79. this year Mark's Stoney
 
05:20:20.868 --> 05:20:20.878 align:start position:0%
Field's 40th anniversary and our company
 
05:20:23.930 --> 05:20:23.940 align:start position:0%
got its start here in New Hampshire many
 
05:20:26.750 --> 05:20:26.760 align:start position:0%
years ago but we still are really a New
 
05:20:28.490 --> 05:20:28.500 align:start position:0%
Hampshire company and we do the vast
 
05:20:31.910 --> 05:20:31.920 align:start position:0%
majority of our manufacturing here in
 
05:20:35.868 --> 05:20:35.878 align:start position:0%
the state and today we employ over 450
 
05:20:38.628 --> 05:20:38.638 align:start position:0%
people at our Londonderry manufacturing
 
05:20:41.590 --> 05:20:41.600 align:start position:0%
facility and offices
 
05:20:43.730 --> 05:20:43.740 align:start position:0%
manufacturers in New Hampshire are
 
05:20:45.050 --> 05:20:45.060 align:start position:0%
saddled with some of the highest
 
05:20:47.330 --> 05:20:47.340 align:start position:0%
electricity rates in the nation
 
05:20:50.150 --> 05:20:50.160 align:start position:0%
this problem is exacerbated by a lack of
 
05:20:53.750 --> 05:20:53.760 align:start position:0%
local distributed generation resources
 
05:20:56.628 --> 05:20:56.638 align:start position:0%
over our 40 years in business we have
 
05:20:59.090 --> 05:20:59.100 align:start position:0%
had to rely on expensive imported
 
05:21:01.310 --> 05:21:01.320 align:start position:0%
sources of energy that have put
 
05:21:03.830 --> 05:21:03.840 align:start position:0%
excessive cost burden on our business
 
05:21:06.830 --> 05:21:06.840 align:start position:0%
and Manufacturing operations
 
05:21:09.470 --> 05:21:09.480 align:start position:0%
driven by both a desire to secure
 
05:21:11.330 --> 05:21:11.340 align:start position:0%
low-cost and reliable source of
 
05:21:13.788 --> 05:21:13.798 align:start position:0%
electricity and by our commitment to
 
05:21:16.310 --> 05:21:16.320 align:start position:0%
sustainability Stonyfield has explored
 
05:21:18.890 --> 05:21:18.900 align:start position:0%
solar energy as an option for our plant
 
05:21:23.090 --> 05:21:23.100 align:start position:0%
in 2005 we installed a system that at
 
05:21:25.730 --> 05:21:25.740 align:start position:0%
the time was the largest solar array in
 
05:21:27.288 --> 05:21:27.298 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire
 
05:21:29.448 --> 05:21:29.458 align:start position:0%
well we're pleased to be able to utilize
 
05:21:32.390 --> 05:21:32.400 align:start position:0%
solar energy at our plant this system
 
05:21:34.730 --> 05:21:34.740 align:start position:0%
provides for less than one percent of
 
05:21:37.250 --> 05:21:37.260 align:start position:0%
our energy needs
 
05:21:39.770 --> 05:21:39.780 align:start position:0%
our ability to expand this solar energy
 
05:21:42.770 --> 05:21:42.780 align:start position:0%
system on site is hampered by the size
 
05:21:45.170 --> 05:21:45.180 align:start position:0%
of our site by the size of the building
 
05:21:47.628 --> 05:21:47.638 align:start position:0%
the configuration of the rooftop and our
 
05:21:50.330 --> 05:21:50.340 align:start position:0%
proximity to the Manchester Airport
 
05:21:52.490 --> 05:21:52.500 align:start position:0%
we have expanded our plant several times
 
05:21:54.530 --> 05:21:54.540 align:start position:0%
since we first installed this solar
 
05:21:58.368 --> 05:21:58.378 align:start position:0%
power and so we have some more roof
 
05:22:00.050 --> 05:22:00.060 align:start position:0%
space but even if we were to fully
 
05:22:02.270 --> 05:22:02.280 align:start position:0%
utilize all of the usable roof space
 
05:22:05.690 --> 05:22:05.700 align:start position:0%
that we have we still get to about five
 
05:22:08.208 --> 05:22:08.218 align:start position:0%
percent of our energy needs through
 
05:22:11.570 --> 05:22:11.580 align:start position:0%
on-site solar energy production and so
 
05:22:13.910 --> 05:22:13.920 align:start position:0%
these limitations have led us to explore
 
05:22:16.310 --> 05:22:16.320 align:start position:0%
other options for procuring electricity
 
05:22:18.708 --> 05:22:18.718 align:start position:0%
from solar or other Renewable Power
 
05:22:18.718 --> 05:22:20.570 align:start position:0%
from solar or other Renewable Power
installations

05:22:20.570 --> 05:22:20.580 align:start position:0%
installations
 
05:22:22.850 --> 05:22:22.860 align:start position:0%
unfortunately the state net metering
 
05:22:25.010 --> 05:22:25.020 align:start position:0%
laws currently prevent us from procuring
 
05:22:27.170 --> 05:22:27.180 align:start position:0%
a sufficient amount of solar energy from
 
05:22:29.510 --> 05:22:29.520 align:start position:0%
other locations in New Hampshire
 
05:22:31.690 --> 05:22:31.700 align:start position:0%
our business has a goal of being 100
 
05:22:35.750 --> 05:22:35.760 align:start position:0%
renewably powered by 2025. in order to
 
05:22:37.610 --> 05:22:37.620 align:start position:0%
advance this goal we have had to resort
 
05:22:40.190 --> 05:22:40.200 align:start position:0%
to sourcing solar electricity from a
 
05:22:43.610 --> 05:22:43.620 align:start position:0%
combination of in-state resources and
 
05:22:46.190 --> 05:22:46.200 align:start position:0%
purchasing renewable energy credits from
 
05:22:48.890 --> 05:22:48.900 align:start position:0%
much larger solar installations in the
 
05:22:51.350 --> 05:22:51.360 align:start position:0%
midwest our commitment to purchase these
 
05:22:53.930 --> 05:22:53.940 align:start position:0%
renewable energy credits were key for
 
05:22:56.570 --> 05:22:56.580 align:start position:0%
these Midwest facilities for them to
 
05:22:58.368 --> 05:22:58.378 align:start position:0%
obtain the rest of the financing that
 
05:23:01.070 --> 05:23:01.080 align:start position:0%
they needed to be constructed but we
 
05:23:02.750 --> 05:23:02.760 align:start position:0%
would really prefer to keep this
 
05:23:04.910 --> 05:23:04.920 align:start position:0%
development of renewable energy here at
 
05:23:07.310 --> 05:23:07.320 align:start position:0%
home in New Hampshire where our dollars
 
05:23:09.470 --> 05:23:09.480 align:start position:0%
can be reinvested in the local economy
 
05:23:13.310 --> 05:23:13.320 align:start position:0%
but State neater statement net metering
 
05:23:14.990 --> 05:23:15.000 align:start position:0%
laws have made this really impractical
 
05:23:17.690 --> 05:23:17.700 align:start position:0%
for us so this is why we are such strong
 
05:23:20.750 --> 05:23:20.760 align:start position:0%
proponents of Senate Bill 79 this bill
 
05:23:23.090 --> 05:23:23.100 align:start position:0%
would enable us to install renewable net
 
05:23:25.490 --> 05:23:25.500 align:start position:0%
meeting generators that can offset more
 
05:23:28.430 --> 05:23:28.440 align:start position:0%
of our annual load the bill would ensure
 
05:23:30.650 --> 05:23:30.660 align:start position:0%
that generation is size so that it would
 
05:23:33.410 --> 05:23:33.420 align:start position:0%
not exceed our existing load as power
 
05:23:35.628 --> 05:23:35.638 align:start position:0%
from a single generator could not be
 
05:23:37.670 --> 05:23:37.680 align:start position:0%
shared across multiple companies or
 
05:23:39.948 --> 05:23:39.958 align:start position:0%
other energy users and this bill would
 
05:23:41.990 --> 05:23:42.000 align:start position:0%
also stipulate that businesses like ours
 
05:23:44.208 --> 05:23:44.218 align:start position:0%
who are customer generators are actually
 
05:23:46.730 --> 05:23:46.740 align:start position:0%
consuming The energy they produce either
 
05:23:49.128 --> 05:23:49.138 align:start position:0%
on-site or under established group net
 
05:23:51.650 --> 05:23:51.660 align:start position:0%
metering so we urge you to advance this
 
05:23:53.750 --> 05:23:53.760 align:start position:0%
bill so that New Hampshire businesses
 
05:23:55.910 --> 05:23:55.920 align:start position:0%
are able to invest in the generation of
 
05:23:58.310 --> 05:23:58.320 align:start position:0%
homegrown renewable energy which would
 
05:24:00.890 --> 05:24:00.900 align:start position:0%
support a stronger local economy more
 
05:24:03.050 --> 05:24:03.060 align:start position:0%
stable and affordable Energy prices for
 
05:24:05.030 --> 05:24:05.040 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire businesses and a more
 
05:24:07.550 --> 05:24:07.560 align:start position:0%
sustainable future thank you happy to
 
05:24:10.368 --> 05:24:10.378 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:14.990 --> 05:24:15.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:17.628 --> 05:24:17.638 align:start position:0%
representative Corman has one thank you
 
05:24:19.070 --> 05:24:19.080 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman thank you for taking my
 
05:24:21.410 --> 05:24:21.420 align:start position:0%
question I I guess I'm a little bit
 
05:24:22.850 --> 05:24:22.860 align:start position:0%
confused about
 
05:24:25.730 --> 05:24:25.740 align:start position:0%
what your current options are
 
05:24:25.740 --> 05:24:26.390 align:start position:0%
what your current options are
um

05:24:26.390 --> 05:24:26.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:24:29.868 --> 05:24:29.878 align:start position:0%
can do you actually have the the space
 
05:24:29.878 --> 05:24:31.070 align:start position:0%
can do you actually have the the space
to

05:24:31.070 --> 05:24:31.080 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:24:33.650 --> 05:24:33.660 align:start position:0%
create more facilities at your location
 
05:24:35.628 --> 05:24:35.638 align:start position:0%
or it would have to be elsewhere it
 
05:24:37.730 --> 05:24:37.740 align:start position:0%
would have to be elsewhere we have fully
 
05:24:42.170 --> 05:24:42.180 align:start position:0%
built out the footprint for buildings on
 
05:24:44.690 --> 05:24:44.700 align:start position:0%
our site and we do not have a
 
05:24:46.190 --> 05:24:46.200 align:start position:0%
significant land base around our
 
05:24:48.430 --> 05:24:48.440 align:start position:0%
building and parking lot that would
 
05:24:52.970 --> 05:24:52.980 align:start position:0%
accommodate a sizable solar installation
 
05:24:54.470 --> 05:24:54.480 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
05:24:57.470 --> 05:24:57.480 align:start position:0%
yes follow-up so so then where this bill
 
05:24:59.330 --> 05:24:59.340 align:start position:0%
to pass
 
05:25:01.670 --> 05:25:01.680 align:start position:0%
you would be able to would you be able
 
05:25:03.350 --> 05:25:03.360 align:start position:0%
to build elsewhere is that is that what
 
05:25:05.030 --> 05:25:05.040 align:start position:0%
it would be doing it would be allowing
 
05:25:07.490 --> 05:25:07.500 align:start position:0%
you to build elsewhere or I'm unclear on
 
05:25:09.350 --> 05:25:09.360 align:start position:0%
how this bill passing actually helps you
 
05:25:13.070 --> 05:25:13.080 align:start position:0%
yes we can support the construction of
 
05:25:16.910 --> 05:25:16.920 align:start position:0%
uh solar energy facility off-site that
 
05:25:17.890 --> 05:25:17.900 align:start position:0%
would Supply
 
05:25:20.990 --> 05:25:21.000 align:start position:0%
uh complete power needs for our
 
05:25:26.150 --> 05:25:26.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:28.610 --> 05:25:28.620 align:start position:0%
thank you would it also be possible for
 
05:25:30.890 --> 05:25:30.900 align:start position:0%
you to accomplish your goals by signing
 
05:25:32.868 --> 05:25:32.878 align:start position:0%
up signing a purchase power agreement
 
05:25:37.010 --> 05:25:37.020 align:start position:0%
with a solar vendor to purchase solar
 
05:25:40.310 --> 05:25:40.320 align:start position:0%
electricity from said vendor
 
05:25:42.650 --> 05:25:42.660 align:start position:0%
yes but currently we would have to go
 
05:25:45.110 --> 05:25:45.120 align:start position:0%
out of state to to find one that was
 
05:25:47.208 --> 05:25:47.218 align:start position:0%
cost effective and we would prefer to
 
05:25:49.730 --> 05:25:49.740 align:start position:0%
keep our investment in renewable energy
 
05:25:52.010 --> 05:25:52.020 align:start position:0%
generation in state here in New
 
05:25:52.020 --> 05:25:53.390 align:start position:0%
generation in state here in New
Hampshire

05:25:53.390 --> 05:25:53.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
05:25:56.690 --> 05:25:56.700 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:58.610 --> 05:25:58.620 align:start position:0%
see no further questions I want to thank
 
05:26:02.330 --> 05:26:02.340 align:start position:0%
you for coming to testify to us
 
05:26:03.770 --> 05:26:03.780 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:26:05.810 --> 05:26:05.820 align:start position:0%
could I ask Griffin Roe Berge to come
 
05:26:08.690 --> 05:26:08.700 align:start position:0%
back up to the testifying table there
 
05:26:10.250 --> 05:26:10.260 align:start position:0%
was one additional question that I
 
05:26:13.010 --> 05:26:13.020 align:start position:0%
needed to ask you Mr Roberge
 
05:26:15.410 --> 05:26:15.420 align:start position:0%
and that question is
 
05:26:18.708 --> 05:26:18.718 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 79 is virtually
 
05:26:20.990 --> 05:26:21.000 align:start position:0%
identical in structure to Senate bill
 
05:26:21.000 --> 05:26:22.788 align:start position:0%
identical in structure to Senate bill
69.

05:26:22.788 --> 05:26:22.798 align:start position:0%
69.
 
05:26:26.330 --> 05:26:26.340 align:start position:0%
and Senate Bill 69 has a fiscal note
 
05:26:30.288 --> 05:26:30.298 align:start position:0%
but Senate Bill 79 does not
 
05:26:32.990 --> 05:26:33.000 align:start position:0%
in spite of that weakness has the
 
05:26:34.850 --> 05:26:34.860 align:start position:0%
department done any kind of an estimate
 
05:26:39.970 --> 05:26:39.980 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:42.590 --> 05:26:42.600 align:start position:0%
facilities might be
 
05:26:45.050 --> 05:26:45.060 align:start position:0%
might qualify
 
05:26:48.410 --> 05:26:48.420 align:start position:0%
we with if this legislation were to pass
 
05:26:51.470 --> 05:26:51.480 align:start position:0%
for example in the 69 fiscal note you
 
05:26:53.930 --> 05:26:53.940 align:start position:0%
estimated 65 entities could become
 
05:26:55.670 --> 05:26:55.680 align:start position:0%
eligible if you've done a similar
 
05:26:57.948 --> 05:26:57.958 align:start position:0%
calculation for this bill we thank you
 
05:27:00.590 --> 05:27:00.600 align:start position:0%
for the question we have not the fiscal
 
05:27:02.448 --> 05:27:02.458 align:start position:0%
notes are generated at the request of
 
05:27:04.208 --> 05:27:04.218 align:start position:0%
the LBA office
 
05:27:06.288 --> 05:27:06.298 align:start position:0%
obviously they requested a fiscal note
 
05:27:08.090 --> 05:27:08.100 align:start position:0%
of us on Senate Bill 69 they did not
 
05:27:12.230 --> 05:27:12.240 align:start position:0%
request one of us on Sam bill 79.
 
05:27:13.850 --> 05:27:13.860 align:start position:0%
would it be possible to get that
 
05:27:16.190 --> 05:27:16.200 align:start position:0%
estimate I could certainly ask yes okay
 
05:27:18.050 --> 05:27:18.060 align:start position:0%
thank you I'd appreciate that
 
05:27:20.750 --> 05:27:20.760 align:start position:0%
that was it thank you thank you you're
 
05:27:22.128 --> 05:27:22.138 align:start position:0%
coming back
 
05:27:25.368 --> 05:27:25.378 align:start position:0%
now we'll move on and I'll call on John
 
05:27:29.448 --> 05:27:29.458 align:start position:0%
Morrison or maybe it's Monson
 
05:27:32.390 --> 05:27:32.400 align:start position:0%
from hitchner manufacturing Morrison
 
05:27:35.750 --> 05:27:35.760 align:start position:0%
thank you it is Morrison yes okay thank
 
05:27:35.760 --> 05:27:50.628 align:start position:0%
thank you it is Morrison yes okay thank
you

05:27:50.628 --> 05:27:50.638 align:start position:0%

to testify in support of Senate bill 79.
 
05:28:08.930 --> 05:28:08.940 align:start position:0%
the Morrison family has a long history
 
05:28:10.850 --> 05:28:10.860 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire first helping to settle
 
05:28:13.970 --> 05:28:13.980 align:start position:0%
the town of Peterborough in 1749.
 
05:28:16.610 --> 05:28:16.620 align:start position:0%
200 years later my great-grandfather and
 
05:28:18.350 --> 05:28:18.360 align:start position:0%
grandfather bought a small Foundry
 
05:28:21.050 --> 05:28:21.060 align:start position:0%
located in The amiskeag Mill Yard to in
 
05:28:23.510 --> 05:28:23.520 align:start position:0%
my grandfather's words provide healthy
 
05:28:25.730 --> 05:28:25.740 align:start position:0%
employment opportunities and build a

after 77 years and four generations the
 
05:28:59.868 --> 05:28:59.878 align:start position:0%
Morrison family remains committed to its
 
05:29:01.430 --> 05:29:01.440 align:start position:0%
vision of helping to build a stronger
 
05:29:02.448 --> 05:29:02.458 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
05:29:04.610 --> 05:29:04.620 align:start position:0%
over the last five years hitchner has
 
05:29:06.170 --> 05:29:06.180 align:start position:0%
invested nearly a hundred million
 
05:29:08.270 --> 05:29:08.280 align:start position:0%
dollars in the state including in a
 
05:29:10.310 --> 05:29:10.320 align:start position:0%
solar array and efficiency projects that
 
05:29:11.930 --> 05:29:11.940 align:start position:0%
have earned over a million dollars in
 
05:29:13.610 --> 05:29:13.620 align:start position:0%
utility rebates
 
05:29:15.590 --> 05:29:15.600 align:start position:0%
as we continue to grow the business we
 
05:29:17.330 --> 05:29:17.340 align:start position:0%
plan to invest another 100 million over
 
05:29:19.128 --> 05:29:19.138 align:start position:0%
the next five years
 
05:29:21.470 --> 05:29:21.480 align:start position:0%
to remain competitive however we must do
 
05:29:23.150 --> 05:29:23.160 align:start position:0%
everything we can to control New
 
05:29:24.830 --> 05:29:24.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's rapidly increasing energy
 
05:29:27.410 --> 05:29:27.420 align:start position:0%
costs in a sustainable manner
 
05:29:29.448 --> 05:29:29.458 align:start position:0%
while we continually find ways to deal
 
05:29:31.430 --> 05:29:31.440 align:start position:0%
with the second highest electrical rates
 
05:29:32.390 --> 05:29:32.400 align:start position:0%
in the country
 
05:29:34.190 --> 05:29:34.200 align:start position:0%
our competitors in the rest of the
 
05:29:36.230 --> 05:29:36.240 align:start position:0%
United States enjoy rates that are 50
 
05:29:38.810 --> 05:29:38.820 align:start position:0%
percent or more lower than hours
 
05:29:41.270 --> 05:29:41.280 align:start position:0%
as a major consumer of electricity this
 
05:29:44.750 --> 05:29:44.760 align:start position:0%
puts us at a significant disadvantage
 
05:29:46.670 --> 05:29:46.680 align:start position:0%
we're also under growing pressure from
 
05:29:48.650 --> 05:29:48.660 align:start position:0%
our customer base to achieve lower
 
05:29:51.590 --> 05:29:51.600 align:start position:0%
energy costs sustainably sustainability
 
05:29:53.448 --> 05:29:53.458 align:start position:0%
is increasingly becoming a competitive
 
05:29:55.670 --> 05:29:55.680 align:start position:0%
factor in all the markets we participate
 
05:29:55.680 --> 05:29:56.750 align:start position:0%
factor in all the markets we participate
in

05:29:56.750 --> 05:29:56.760 align:start position:0%
in
 
05:29:58.670 --> 05:29:58.680 align:start position:0%
this is why I'm excited to testify here
 
05:30:00.850 --> 05:30:00.860 align:start position:0%
today in support of Senate Bill 79
 
05:30:03.650 --> 05:30:03.660 align:start position:0%
extending the benefits of House Bill 315
 
05:30:06.470 --> 05:30:06.480 align:start position:0%
signed by governor sununu in 21 to the
 
05:30:07.850 --> 05:30:07.860 align:start position:0%
industrial scale business Community
 
05:30:10.368 --> 05:30:10.378 align:start position:0%
would enable hitchner to offset nearly
 
05:30:13.190 --> 05:30:13.200 align:start position:0%
20 percent of its electrical demand in a
 
05:30:15.410 --> 05:30:15.420 align:start position:0%
cost-effective and sustainable way
 
05:30:17.208 --> 05:30:17.218 align:start position:0%
this in turn would help us to remain
 
05:30:18.770 --> 05:30:18.780 align:start position:0%
competitive as we continue to work
 
05:30:20.330 --> 05:30:20.340 align:start position:0%
towards building a stronger more
 
05:30:21.830 --> 05:30:21.840 align:start position:0%
Sustainable New Hampshire
 
05:30:23.330 --> 05:30:23.340 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your time today
 
05:30:25.128 --> 05:30:25.138 align:start position:0%
and for your attention to this important
 
05:30:27.708 --> 05:30:27.718 align:start position:0%
issue I urge you to pass Senate Bill 79
 
05:30:29.390 --> 05:30:29.400 align:start position:0%
in support of the New Hampshire business
 
05:30:31.310 --> 05:30:31.320 align:start position:0%
community and for the benefit of the
 
05:30:34.010 --> 05:30:34.020 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:38.570 --> 05:30:38.580 align:start position:0%
thank you questions for Mr Morrison
 
05:30:41.150 --> 05:30:41.160 align:start position:0%
representative McGee thank you thank you
 
05:30:43.070 --> 05:30:43.080 align:start position:0%
Mr Morrison for taking my question and I
 
05:30:44.690 --> 05:30:44.700 align:start position:0%
believe I sent a thank you card to you
 
05:30:47.208 --> 05:30:47.218 align:start position:0%
guys during the pandemic you were one of
 
05:30:48.948 --> 05:30:48.958 align:start position:0%
my towns when I had a floaterial because
 
05:30:51.470 --> 05:30:51.480 align:start position:0%
you were building you were doing PPE yes
 
05:30:53.090 --> 05:30:53.100 align:start position:0%
that was one of the one of the many
 
05:30:55.970 --> 05:30:55.980 align:start position:0%
things we did yeah yeah it was great
 
05:30:57.948 --> 05:30:57.958 align:start position:0%
um so you're you're a good Steward good
 
05:31:01.550 --> 05:31:01.560 align:start position:0%
citizen I
 
05:31:04.430 --> 05:31:04.440 align:start position:0%
I would like to ask you you referred a
 
05:31:07.070 --> 05:31:07.080 align:start position:0%
couple of times to uh the investment
 
05:31:08.570 --> 05:31:08.580 align:start position:0%
that you made and the investment that
 
05:31:10.970 --> 05:31:10.980 align:start position:0%
you are planning to make
 
05:31:13.128 --> 05:31:13.138 align:start position:0%
um I'm assuming that's to reach specific
 
05:31:15.110 --> 05:31:15.120 align:start position:0%
internal goals that you've set for your
 
05:31:15.120 --> 05:31:16.730 align:start position:0%
internal goals that you've set for your
company

05:31:16.730 --> 05:31:16.740 align:start position:0%
company
 
05:31:16.740 --> 05:31:17.990 align:start position:0%
company
um

05:31:17.990 --> 05:31:18.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:31:22.610 --> 05:31:22.620 align:start position:0%
would you say that the the lack of solar
 
05:31:25.430 --> 05:31:25.440 align:start position:0%
uptake or support in the state has had
 
05:31:28.070 --> 05:31:28.080 align:start position:0%
an effect on your plans to try and meet
 
05:31:29.330 --> 05:31:29.340 align:start position:0%
those goals
 
05:31:31.550 --> 05:31:31.560 align:start position:0%
yeah I think it's one factor I think the
 
05:31:33.350 --> 05:31:33.360 align:start position:0%
overwhelming factor is the cost of
 
05:31:36.230 --> 05:31:36.240 align:start position:0%
electricity and energy in general and so
 
05:31:37.270 --> 05:31:37.280 align:start position:0%
for us
 
05:31:40.010 --> 05:31:40.020 align:start position:0%
solar and Senate Bill 79 in particular
 
05:31:42.650 --> 05:31:42.660 align:start position:0%
is is a potential Way Forward in
 
05:31:45.830 --> 05:31:45.840 align:start position:0%
addressing some of those concerns and
 
05:31:48.350 --> 05:31:48.360 align:start position:0%
short of anything else that's sort of
 
05:31:50.990 --> 05:31:51.000 align:start position:0%
the best option on the table right now
 
05:31:56.150 --> 05:31:56.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:00.288 --> 05:32:00.298 align:start position:0%
so the inflation reduction act provided
 
05:32:03.470 --> 05:32:03.480 align:start position:0%
permanent investment tax credits for the
 
05:32:05.930 --> 05:32:05.940 align:start position:0%
installation of solar facilities
 
05:32:09.050 --> 05:32:09.060 align:start position:0%
as well as substantial
 
05:32:09.060 --> 05:32:09.890 align:start position:0%
as well as substantial
um

05:32:09.890 --> 05:32:09.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:32:09.900 --> 05:32:12.190 align:start position:0%
um
tax

05:32:12.190 --> 05:32:12.200 align:start position:0%
tax
 
05:32:14.990 --> 05:32:15.000 align:start position:0%
reductions in tax benefits
 
05:32:17.448 --> 05:32:17.458 align:start position:0%
how do those compared to the relief you
 
05:32:20.030 --> 05:32:20.040 align:start position:0%
anticipate from a bill like Senate Bill
 
05:32:20.040 --> 05:32:21.288 align:start position:0%
anticipate from a bill like Senate Bill
79

05:32:21.288 --> 05:32:21.298 align:start position:0%
79
 
05:32:23.570 --> 05:32:23.580 align:start position:0%
well thanks for the question that's
 
05:32:25.250 --> 05:32:25.260 align:start position:0%
that's very interesting question I I
 
05:32:27.110 --> 05:32:27.120 align:start position:0%
think they're actually synergistic right
 
05:32:29.570 --> 05:32:29.580 align:start position:0%
and so the ability to install additional
 
05:32:32.510 --> 05:32:32.520 align:start position:0%
solar capacity would allow us to
 
05:32:34.970 --> 05:32:34.980 align:start position:0%
take advantage of these tax credits more
 
05:32:38.930 --> 05:32:38.940 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:41.690 --> 05:32:41.700 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative munz has a
 
05:32:43.550 --> 05:32:43.560 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair and thank
 
05:32:46.070 --> 05:32:46.080 align:start position:0%
you for coming in I'm looking at the um
 
05:32:48.110 --> 05:32:48.120 align:start position:0%
the union leader article that you
 
05:32:50.208 --> 05:32:50.218 align:start position:0%
distributed the the one specifically
 
05:32:52.128 --> 05:32:52.138 align:start position:0%
talking about new study examines the
 
05:32:55.490 --> 05:32:55.500 align:start position:0%
cost versus benefit of more solar I was
 
05:32:56.810 --> 05:32:56.820 align:start position:0%
wondering if you wanted to comment on
 
05:32:56.820 --> 05:32:58.010 align:start position:0%
wondering if you wanted to comment on
that

05:32:58.010 --> 05:32:58.020 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:33:00.110 --> 05:33:00.120 align:start position:0%
I think it's
 
05:33:02.448 --> 05:33:02.458 align:start position:0%
been widely commented on already today
 
05:33:04.670 --> 05:33:04.680 align:start position:0%
but I think the gist of the article is
 
05:33:04.680 --> 05:33:06.190 align:start position:0%
but I think the gist of the article is
that

05:33:06.190 --> 05:33:06.200 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:33:09.948 --> 05:33:09.958 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of other benefits that
 
05:33:13.070 --> 05:33:13.080 align:start position:0%
the the insignificant increase that's
 
05:33:14.510 --> 05:33:14.520 align:start position:0%
been mentioned don't necessarily take
 
05:33:16.430 --> 05:33:16.440 align:start position:0%
into account and I think those are
 
05:33:18.170 --> 05:33:18.180 align:start position:0%
important benefits that we need to keep
 
05:33:21.110 --> 05:33:21.120 align:start position:0%
in mind as we think about the the cost
 
05:33:32.030 --> 05:33:32.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:33.890 --> 05:33:33.900 align:start position:0%
further questions for the committee
 
05:33:36.890 --> 05:33:36.900 align:start position:0%
representative Reynolds has one
 
05:33:38.990 --> 05:33:39.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
05:33:41.090 --> 05:33:41.100 align:start position:0%
and thank you for being here today
 
05:33:41.100 --> 05:33:42.530 align:start position:0%
and thank you for being here today
um

05:33:42.530 --> 05:33:42.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:33:47.270 --> 05:33:47.280 align:start position:0%
those who oppose the expansion of net
 
05:33:47.280 --> 05:33:48.610 align:start position:0%
those who oppose the expansion of net
metering

05:33:48.610 --> 05:33:48.620 align:start position:0%
metering
 
05:33:52.128 --> 05:33:52.138 align:start position:0%
continue to insist that the
 
05:33:52.138 --> 05:33:53.690 align:start position:0%
continue to insist that the
savings

05:33:53.690 --> 05:33:53.700 align:start position:0%
savings
 
05:33:57.650 --> 05:33:57.660 align:start position:0%
that are realized by the owners of net
 
05:33:59.990 --> 05:34:00.000 align:start position:0%
meter generation such as your company
 
05:34:02.750 --> 05:34:02.760 align:start position:0%
and all the other these other companies
 
05:34:04.970 --> 05:34:04.980 align:start position:0%
listed on one of your handouts large
 
05:34:08.750 --> 05:34:08.760 align:start position:0%
companies they insist that those savings
 
05:34:11.090 --> 05:34:11.100 align:start position:0%
that accrue to your company and others
 
05:34:13.670 --> 05:34:13.680 align:start position:0%
come essentially come at the expense of
 
05:34:17.448 --> 05:34:17.458 align:start position:0%
all rate payers but given the
 
05:34:20.090 --> 05:34:20.100 align:start position:0%
scale of employment represented by just
 
05:34:22.670 --> 05:34:22.680 align:start position:0%
these nine
 
05:34:25.610 --> 05:34:25.620 align:start position:0%
these nine employers but all you know
 
05:34:28.670 --> 05:34:28.680 align:start position:0%
other employers who could perhaps and
 
05:34:31.310 --> 05:34:31.320 align:start position:0%
other institutions that might be able to
 
05:34:32.990 --> 05:34:33.000 align:start position:0%
take advantage of expanded net metering
 
05:34:35.208 --> 05:34:35.218 align:start position:0%
would you like to push back on that what
 
05:34:39.170 --> 05:34:39.180 align:start position:0%
would you say in in to rebut that yeah I
 
05:34:41.330 --> 05:34:41.340 align:start position:0%
think I can't speak for other companies
 
05:34:44.150 --> 05:34:44.160 align:start position:0%
but in our case specifically I mean the
 
05:34:46.368 --> 05:34:46.378 align:start position:0%
whole point of our company is is to
 
05:34:49.010 --> 05:34:49.020 align:start position:0%
contribute to the economy here and so I
 
05:34:50.330 --> 05:34:50.340 align:start position:0%
wouldn't really be advocating for
 
05:34:52.310 --> 05:34:52.320 align:start position:0%
anything that I thought personally would
 
05:34:56.208 --> 05:34:56.218 align:start position:0%
detract from that I mean
 
05:34:59.590 --> 05:34:59.600 align:start position:0%
yeah I guess
 
05:35:02.090 --> 05:35:02.100 align:start position:0%
the financial stability of our employees
 
05:35:05.208 --> 05:35:05.218 align:start position:0%
is extremely important and so uh doing
 
05:35:07.490 --> 05:35:07.500 align:start position:0%
something that would be profitable for
 
05:35:09.288 --> 05:35:09.298 align:start position:0%
us at the expense of our employees is
 
05:35:12.288 --> 05:35:12.298 align:start position:0%
not something that we'd be looking to do
 
05:35:12.298 --> 05:35:13.730 align:start position:0%
not something that we'd be looking to do
so

05:35:13.730 --> 05:35:13.740 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:35:16.190 --> 05:35:16.200 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:35:19.010 --> 05:35:19.020 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
05:35:20.810 --> 05:35:20.820 align:start position:0%
seeing none I'll thank you for
 
05:35:22.730 --> 05:35:22.740 align:start position:0%
testifying this morning or this evening
 
05:35:26.208 --> 05:35:26.218 align:start position:0%
or afternoon whatever it is and uh call
 
05:35:29.750 --> 05:35:29.760 align:start position:0%
Lindsey Burgoyne of revision energy to
 
05:35:31.490 --> 05:35:31.500 align:start position:0%
give us her perspective on this
 
05:35:31.500 --> 05:35:35.350 align:start position:0%
give us her perspective on this
legislation

05:35:35.350 --> 05:35:35.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:37.610 --> 05:35:37.620 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for pronouncing
 
05:35:40.310 --> 05:35:40.320 align:start position:0%
my last name right that is a rarity so I
 
05:35:41.810 --> 05:35:41.820 align:start position:0%
appreciate that
 
05:35:43.310 --> 05:35:43.320 align:start position:0%
um chairman Vos Vice chairman Thomas
 
05:35:44.570 --> 05:35:44.580 align:start position:0%
members of the committee my name is
 
05:35:46.250 --> 05:35:46.260 align:start position:0%
Lindsey Burgoyne I serve as the policy
 
05:35:47.690 --> 05:35:47.700 align:start position:0%
and government Affairs director for
 
05:35:48.910 --> 05:35:48.920 align:start position:0%
revision energy
 
05:35:51.530 --> 05:35:51.540 align:start position:0%
as you well know revision is an
 
05:35:53.750 --> 05:35:53.760 align:start position:0%
employee-owned company leading across
 
05:35:56.270 --> 05:35:56.280 align:start position:0%
New England we have 100 employees in New
 
05:35:58.310 --> 05:35:58.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and facilities and offices in
 
05:36:00.830 --> 05:36:00.840 align:start position:0%
Enfield and Brentwood I'm here today to
 
05:36:02.628 --> 05:36:02.638 align:start position:0%
share a joint letter that I should have
 
05:36:09.948 --> 05:36:09.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:11.868 --> 05:36:11.878 align:start position:0%
from the clean energy industry in
 
05:36:13.850 --> 05:36:13.860 align:start position:0%
support of multiple bills that you've
 
05:36:18.050 --> 05:36:18.060 align:start position:0%
heard today 68 69 and SB 79.
 
05:36:19.550 --> 05:36:19.560 align:start position:0%
um as you've heard largely today in a
 
05:36:21.110 --> 05:36:21.120 align:start position:0%
landscape of unsustainably high energy
 
05:36:23.690 --> 05:36:23.700 align:start position:0%
costs Community scale projects give an
 
05:36:26.590 --> 05:36:26.600 align:start position:0%
opportunity to provide lower cost lower
 
05:36:29.090 --> 05:36:29.100 align:start position:0%
electricity which is a mission of our
 
05:36:31.368 --> 05:36:31.378 align:start position:0%
employee-owned company the three bills
 
05:36:33.050 --> 05:36:33.060 align:start position:0%
represent incremental steps towards
 
05:36:34.550 --> 05:36:34.560 align:start position:0%
growing and enabling a local clean
 
05:36:36.890 --> 05:36:36.900 align:start position:0%
energy industry here in New Hampshire as
 
05:36:38.868 --> 05:36:38.878 align:start position:0%
they allow us to pursue projects here
 
05:36:40.550 --> 05:36:40.560 align:start position:0%
that ultimately bring investment in
 
05:36:43.010 --> 05:36:43.020 align:start position:0%
Economic Development to the state and
 
05:36:45.230 --> 05:36:45.240 align:start position:0%
keep those dollars within this state in
 
05:36:46.368 --> 05:36:46.378 align:start position:0%
full disclosure I'm going to share with
 
05:36:48.110 --> 05:36:48.120 align:start position:0%
you all that today is my ninth day of
 
05:36:50.270 --> 05:36:50.280 align:start position:0%
employment with revision I am new on the
 
05:36:52.730 --> 05:36:52.740 align:start position:0%
job with the organization so I'm
 
05:36:55.368 --> 05:36:55.378 align:start position:0%
respectfully going to close here I'm
 
05:36:56.868 --> 05:36:56.878 align:start position:0%
very happy to relay any technical
 
05:37:00.050 --> 05:37:00.060 align:start position:0%
questions you have to my co-workers and
 
05:37:01.850 --> 05:37:01.860 align:start position:0%
to provide those answers in a timely
 
05:37:05.750 --> 05:37:05.760 align:start position:0%
manner to you all so thank you for your
 
05:37:07.670 --> 05:37:07.680 align:start position:0%
time today and as I mentioned happy to
 
05:37:12.890 --> 05:37:12.900 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:15.170 --> 05:37:15.180 align:start position:0%
well thank you and congratulations on
 
05:37:16.850 --> 05:37:16.860 align:start position:0%

05:37:18.770 --> 05:37:18.780 align:start position:0%
I hope you do well
 
05:37:20.810 --> 05:37:20.820 align:start position:0%
so do we have questions from the
 
05:37:25.970 --> 05:37:25.980 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:28.670 --> 05:37:28.680 align:start position:0%
well apparently not you did a good job
 
05:37:30.288 --> 05:37:30.298 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much and I look
 
05:37:32.628 --> 05:37:32.638 align:start position:0%
forward to working with you all over the
 
05:37:36.170 --> 05:37:36.180 align:start position:0%
next years okay thank you
 
05:37:38.810 --> 05:37:38.820 align:start position:0%
so that brings us to our last testifier
 
05:37:41.510 --> 05:37:41.520 align:start position:0%
on Senate Bill 79
 
05:37:43.910 --> 05:37:43.920 align:start position:0%
which coincidentally is our last speaker
 
05:37:45.590 --> 05:37:45.600 align:start position:0%
for the entire day
 
05:37:48.410 --> 05:37:48.420 align:start position:0%
so I'm sure he'll be mindful of that and
 
05:37:51.590 --> 05:37:51.600 align:start position:0%
brief as Mr Sam Evans Brown
 
05:37:53.750 --> 05:37:53.760 align:start position:0%
tells us about his perspective on this
 
05:37:53.760 --> 05:37:55.368 align:start position:0%
tells us about his perspective on this
bill

05:37:55.368 --> 05:37:55.378 align:start position:0%
bill
 
05:37:57.350 --> 05:37:57.360 align:start position:0%
um I will be brief I will share I'm a
 
05:37:58.970 --> 05:37:58.980 align:start position:0%
part of the crew that ordered lunch and
 
05:38:00.770 --> 05:38:00.780 align:start position:0%
lunch did not arrive in time so I'm
 
05:38:02.750 --> 05:38:02.760 align:start position:0%
suffering from an extreme blood sugar
 
05:38:05.628 --> 05:38:05.638 align:start position:0%
low as we speak so um I want to get out
 
05:38:07.850 --> 05:38:07.860 align:start position:0%
of here as much as everybody else
 
05:38:09.890 --> 05:38:09.900 align:start position:0%
um I I just want to come up because I'm
 
05:38:11.990 --> 05:38:12.000 align:start position:0%
I'm I would like to address a number of
 
05:38:13.430 --> 05:38:13.440 align:start position:0%
mischaracterizations that I believe I
 
05:38:14.750 --> 05:38:14.760 align:start position:0%
heard in the department of Energy's
 
05:38:14.760 --> 05:38:16.010 align:start position:0%
heard in the department of Energy's
testimony

05:38:16.010 --> 05:38:16.020 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
05:38:17.810 --> 05:38:17.820 align:start position:0%
um I think all the stakeholders that
 
05:38:18.830 --> 05:38:18.840 align:start position:0%
have been working on this bill will be
 
05:38:20.990 --> 05:38:21.000 align:start position:0%
very happy to fix any technical problems
 
05:38:22.610 --> 05:38:22.620 align:start position:0%
with the bill that the department of
 
05:38:24.470 --> 05:38:24.480 align:start position:0%
energy spotlighted I do think that some
 
05:38:26.930 --> 05:38:26.940 align:start position:0%
of the the issues that were raised Merit
 
05:38:29.810 --> 05:38:29.820 align:start position:0%
uh correction and I think they were not
 
05:38:32.690 --> 05:38:32.700 align:start position:0%
intentional it's important to note that
 
05:38:34.730 --> 05:38:34.740 align:start position:0%
the doe testified as neutral on this
 
05:38:36.830 --> 05:38:36.840 align:start position:0%
bill in the Senate and it's easy to go
 
05:38:39.410 --> 05:38:39.420 align:start position:0%
back and verify that so it is we did not
 
05:38:41.270 --> 05:38:41.280 align:start position:0%
know that the department was opposed to
 
05:38:42.708 --> 05:38:42.718 align:start position:0%
this idea until we walked into the
 
05:38:44.448 --> 05:38:44.458 align:start position:0%
hearing room today
 
05:38:46.690 --> 05:38:46.700 align:start position:0%
um and and I'm I'm frustrated to hear
 
05:38:48.350 --> 05:38:48.360 align:start position:0%
mischaracterization of the value
 
05:38:51.050 --> 05:38:51.060 align:start position:0%
distributed energy resources study the
 
05:38:53.448 --> 05:38:53.458 align:start position:0%
what the study he found was that if we
 
05:38:55.128 --> 05:38:55.138 align:start position:0%
were to leave the existing tariff
 
05:38:58.910 --> 05:38:58.920 align:start position:0%
structure in place until 2035 the
 
05:39:01.430 --> 05:39:01.440 align:start position:0%
estimated potential cost shift to non-dg
 
05:39:03.730 --> 05:39:03.740 align:start position:0%
owning customers might be one percent
 
05:39:06.770 --> 05:39:06.780 align:start position:0%
that's what the study found this is not
 
05:39:08.150 --> 05:39:08.160 align:start position:0%
saying there's a one percent cost shift
 
05:39:11.990 --> 05:39:12.000 align:start position:0%
today it's in 2035 there might be one if
 
05:39:13.490 --> 05:39:13.500 align:start position:0%
we were to leave the Tariff structure
 
05:39:15.170 --> 05:39:15.180 align:start position:0%
that we have in that we have now in
 
05:39:17.270 --> 05:39:17.280 align:start position:0%
place for that entire time but of course
 
05:39:18.410 --> 05:39:18.420 align:start position:0%
we know that we're not going to leave
 
05:39:19.610 --> 05:39:19.620 align:start position:0%
that tariff structure in place for that
 
05:39:21.110 --> 05:39:21.120 align:start position:0%
entire time because as you have heard
 
05:39:23.030 --> 05:39:23.040 align:start position:0%
there's a docket that has been opened
 
05:39:24.948 --> 05:39:24.958 align:start position:0%
that's going to re-examine the Tariff so
 
05:39:27.170 --> 05:39:27.180 align:start position:0%
I would anticipate that by next summer
 
05:39:29.030 --> 05:39:29.040 align:start position:0%
there will be alternate tariffs in place
 
05:39:31.910 --> 05:39:31.920 align:start position:0%
and that may that you know when you read
 
05:39:34.010 --> 05:39:34.020 align:start position:0%
the order that opens that docket the
 
05:39:35.750 --> 05:39:35.760 align:start position:0%
main purpose of that docket is to make
 
05:39:38.510 --> 05:39:38.520 align:start position:0%
sure that cost shift is not occurring so
 
05:39:40.190 --> 05:39:40.200 align:start position:0%
I would argue that the Tariff structure
 
05:39:42.650 --> 05:39:42.660 align:start position:0%
we have today is very close to the right
 
05:39:45.170 --> 05:39:45.180 align:start position:0%
one and that with some minimal tweaks to
 
05:39:47.270 --> 05:39:47.280 align:start position:0%
try to ensure that more of the benefits
 
05:39:48.708 --> 05:39:48.718 align:start position:0%
that accrue to utilities when
 
05:39:50.270 --> 05:39:50.280 align:start position:0%
distributed generation is interconnected
 
05:39:52.970 --> 05:39:52.980 align:start position:0%
onto their grid are are actually aligned
 
05:39:54.650 --> 05:39:54.660 align:start position:0%
with with the policy objective of
 
05:39:57.050 --> 05:39:57.060 align:start position:0%
eliminating cost shift which you know I
 
05:39:58.490 --> 05:39:58.500 align:start position:0%
have have some ideas and if folks would
 
05:40:00.530 --> 05:40:00.540 align:start position:0%
like I can give you a preview of them uh
 
05:40:03.230 --> 05:40:03.240 align:start position:0%
when perhaps I have eaten something
 
05:40:03.240 --> 05:40:03.948 align:start position:0%
when perhaps I have eaten something
um

05:40:03.948 --> 05:40:03.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:40:07.670 --> 05:40:07.680 align:start position:0%
to lay that out though why does why do
 
05:40:09.890 --> 05:40:09.900 align:start position:0%
net metered projects maybe just to go
 
05:40:11.570 --> 05:40:11.580 align:start position:0%
back to basics here why do they get a
 
05:40:14.510 --> 05:40:14.520 align:start position:0%
higher rate than the wholesale rate the
 
05:40:16.610 --> 05:40:16.620 align:start position:0%
reason is that yes their cost the
 
05:40:18.350 --> 05:40:18.360 align:start position:0%
utilities largely in the form of
 
05:40:20.390 --> 05:40:20.400 align:start position:0%
decreased energy sales from those DG
 
05:40:22.490 --> 05:40:22.500 align:start position:0%
customers but there also benefits to the
 
05:40:24.350 --> 05:40:24.360 align:start position:0%
utilities as well in the form of
 
05:40:26.690 --> 05:40:26.700 align:start position:0%
decreased line losses in the form of
 
05:40:29.208 --> 05:40:29.218 align:start position:0%
avoided uh uh energy purchases
 
05:40:31.070 --> 05:40:31.080 align:start position:0%
themselves in the affordable in the form
 
05:40:33.170 --> 05:40:33.180 align:start position:0%
of avoided capacity payments all of
 
05:40:34.550 --> 05:40:34.560 align:start position:0%
those are benefits that accrue to the
 
05:40:36.650 --> 05:40:36.660 align:start position:0%
utility that are passed on to a
 
05:40:38.208 --> 05:40:38.218 align:start position:0%
distributed generation customer in the
 
05:40:40.010 --> 05:40:40.020 align:start position:0%
form of the net metering tariff that is
 
05:40:42.470 --> 05:40:42.480 align:start position:0%
why on a bipartisan basis time and time
 
05:40:43.850 --> 05:40:43.860 align:start position:0%
again the New Hampshire legislature has
 
05:40:46.010 --> 05:40:46.020 align:start position:0%
sought to reaffirm that net metering is
 
05:40:48.590 --> 05:40:48.600 align:start position:0%
a why is policy choice now could that
 
05:40:51.650 --> 05:40:51.660 align:start position:0%
tariff be made better yes and that is
 
05:40:53.810 --> 05:40:53.820 align:start position:0%
what the docket is about the docket is
 
05:40:55.030 --> 05:40:55.040 align:start position:0%
not about
 
05:40:57.350 --> 05:40:57.360 align:start position:0%
where are you know the geographic
 
05:40:58.850 --> 05:40:58.860 align:start position:0%
restrictions on net metering customers
 
05:41:01.070 --> 05:41:01.080 align:start position:0%
it's not about what type of customer
 
05:41:02.628 --> 05:41:02.638 align:start position:0%
classes should be allowed to participate
 
05:41:04.730 --> 05:41:04.740 align:start position:0%
up to up to five megawatts those are
 
05:41:07.670 --> 05:41:07.680 align:start position:0%
policy choices that this body gets to
 
05:41:07.680 --> 05:41:08.628 align:start position:0%
policy choices that this body gets to
decide

05:41:08.628 --> 05:41:08.638 align:start position:0%
decide
 
05:41:11.390 --> 05:41:11.400 align:start position:0%
so uh one other question that I heard
 
05:41:12.770 --> 05:41:12.780 align:start position:0%
asked that I would like to address is
 
05:41:15.350 --> 05:41:15.360 align:start position:0%
that 65 of the state's load is in the
 
05:41:16.670 --> 05:41:16.680 align:start position:0%
commercial and Industrial sector so it
 
05:41:18.830 --> 05:41:18.840 align:start position:0%
does not Senate Bill 79 represent a
 
05:41:20.270 --> 05:41:20.280 align:start position:0%
dramatic increase in the amount of net
 
05:41:21.948 --> 05:41:21.958 align:start position:0%
metering that's happening I would answer
 
05:41:25.430 --> 05:41:25.440 align:start position:0%
that as no because uh this bill applies
 
05:41:28.250 --> 05:41:28.260 align:start position:0%
exclusively to businesses that are large
 
05:41:30.410 --> 05:41:30.420 align:start position:0%
enough to install five megawatts of net
 
05:41:32.930 --> 05:41:32.940 align:start position:0%
metering on their own this bill as as
 
05:41:35.208 --> 05:41:35.218 align:start position:0%
written does not contemplate sharing a
 
05:41:36.590 --> 05:41:36.600 align:start position:0%
single five megawatt array between
 
05:41:39.050 --> 05:41:39.060 align:start position:0%
multiple customers is only one customer
 
05:41:41.570 --> 05:41:41.580 align:start position:0%
that has enough load in a single
 
05:41:43.010 --> 05:41:43.020 align:start position:0%
commercial entity to have a five
 
05:41:44.448 --> 05:41:44.458 align:start position:0%
megawatt array of which there are
 
05:41:46.010 --> 05:41:46.020 align:start position:0%
relatively few in the state of New
 
05:41:47.628 --> 05:41:47.638 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and you've heard from two of
 
05:41:50.208 --> 05:41:50.218 align:start position:0%
them here at testimony today
 
05:41:53.510 --> 05:41:53.520 align:start position:0%
so uh I think that's all I've got have
 
05:41:56.628 --> 05:41:56.638 align:start position:0%
it take any questions if we'll have them
 
05:41:58.970 --> 05:41:58.980 align:start position:0%
sorry about your blood sugar but
 
05:42:00.128 --> 05:42:00.138 align:start position:0%
it happens
 
05:42:03.770 --> 05:42:03.780 align:start position:0%
questions for Sam Evans Brown
 
05:42:06.288 --> 05:42:06.298 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas has a question uh
 
05:42:07.550 --> 05:42:07.560 align:start position:0%
thank you Monsieur thank you for taking
 
05:42:09.708 --> 05:42:09.718 align:start position:0%
my question uh just the last thing you
 
05:42:10.850 --> 05:42:10.860 align:start position:0%
said otherwise I wouldn't have a
 
05:42:10.860 --> 05:42:12.110 align:start position:0%
said otherwise I wouldn't have a
question

05:42:12.110 --> 05:42:12.120 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:42:13.850 --> 05:42:13.860 align:start position:0%
um you said two industries that were
 
05:42:14.930 --> 05:42:14.940 align:start position:0%
here today
 
05:42:17.208 --> 05:42:17.218 align:start position:0%
would qualify for the five megawatt in
 
05:42:22.448 --> 05:42:22.458 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:25.070 --> 05:42:25.080 align:start position:0%
said they didn't have even if they did
 
05:42:27.830 --> 05:42:27.840 align:start position:0%
have that load they hadn't load so that
 
05:42:29.510 --> 05:42:29.520 align:start position:0%
the the bill as written is intended to
 
05:42:31.250 --> 05:42:31.260 align:start position:0%
make it possible for them to install a
 
05:42:33.770 --> 05:42:33.780 align:start position:0%
single array somewhere in the utility
 
05:42:35.390 --> 05:42:35.400 align:start position:0%
service territory of the utility that's
 
05:42:37.610 --> 05:42:37.620 align:start position:0%
serving them and for them to sign up to
 
05:42:39.770 --> 05:42:39.780 align:start position:0%
be the off taker for that single five
 
05:42:42.410 --> 05:42:42.420 align:start position:0%
megawatt array oh not initially space on
 
05:42:44.628 --> 05:42:44.638 align:start position:0%
site but just a load to get right from
 
05:42:46.010 --> 05:42:46.020 align:start position:0%
anywhere else and as I'm sure you'd hear
 
05:42:47.930 --> 05:42:47.940 align:start position:0%
many industrial customers struggle with
 
05:42:49.670 --> 05:42:49.680 align:start position:0%
having the space on site to offset the
 
05:42:51.110 --> 05:42:51.120 align:start position:0%
load that they that their facility
 
05:42:56.208 --> 05:42:56.218 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:59.030 --> 05:42:59.040 align:start position:0%
further questions for Mr Sam Evans Brown
 
05:43:00.410 --> 05:43:00.420 align:start position:0%
so he can get out of here and get
 
05:43:02.208 --> 05:43:02.218 align:start position:0%
something to eat hands are shaking I
 
05:43:03.590 --> 05:43:03.600 align:start position:0%
need a snacks so bad
 
05:43:05.330 --> 05:43:05.340 align:start position:0%
thank you okay seeing done thanks a lot
 
05:43:05.340 --> 05:43:06.350 align:start position:0%
thank you okay seeing done thanks a lot

05:43:06.350 --> 05:43:06.360 align:start position:0%
Sam
 
05:43:08.750 --> 05:43:08.760 align:start position:0%
and thanks to everybody who came today
 
05:43:10.910 --> 05:43:10.920 align:start position:0%
to testify on this bill I'd like to ask
 
05:43:13.128 --> 05:43:13.138 align:start position:0%
representative closure
 
05:43:16.788 --> 05:43:16.798 align:start position:0%
to give us the blue sheet data on
 
05:43:21.170 --> 05:43:21.180 align:start position:0%
Center Bill 69 and Senate bill 79.
 
05:43:23.570 --> 05:43:23.580 align:start position:0%
now while he's doing that I'll close the
 
05:43:28.610 --> 05:43:28.620 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:28.620 --> 05:43:31.570 align:start position:0%
 
well

05:43:31.570 --> 05:43:31.580 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:36.110 --> 05:43:36.120 align:start position:0%
and 68 right so Mr representative
 
05:43:43.190 --> 05:43:43.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:45.170 --> 05:43:45.180 align:start position:0%
yeah that's what representative closure
 
05:43:48.170 --> 05:43:48.180 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:50.810 --> 05:43:50.820 align:start position:0%

okay thank you so we're finished for
 
05:44:38.090 --> 05:44:38.100 align:start position:0%
today I'd remind committee members who
 
05:44:39.890 --> 05:44:39.900 align:start position:0%
will be back be back again next Monday
 
05:44:42.830 --> 05:44:42.840 align:start position:0%
April 10th to hear some more Senate
 
05:44:45.590 --> 05:44:45.600 align:start position:0%
bills and then we will return on April
 
05:44:48.410 --> 05:44:48.420 align:start position:0%
17th to hear more and we will probably
 
05:44:51.948 --> 05:44:51.958 align:start position:0%
exec some of those bills on the 17th and
 
05:44:54.530 --> 05:44:54.540 align:start position:0%
any that we don't finish on the 17th we
 
05:44:56.810 --> 05:44:56.820 align:start position:0%
will finish on the 18th representative
 
05:45:00.230 --> 05:45:00.240 align:start position:0%
Thomas has an announcement
 
05:45:02.208 --> 05:45:02.218 align:start position:0%
no just remind you to please collect all
 
05:45:04.070 --> 05:45:04.080 align:start position:0%
of your trash papers whatever you had
 
05:45:05.930 --> 05:45:05.940 align:start position:0%
here please take it off your table and
