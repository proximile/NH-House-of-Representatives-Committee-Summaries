Newton and plastow so I'm here to
 
00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:40.640 align:start position:0%
introduce House Bill 711 in act relative
 
00:03:43.429 --> 00:03:43.439 align:start position:0%
to voting machine contractors what this
 
00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:45.480 align:start position:0%
bill does is very simple requires
 
00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:48.239 align:start position:0%
contractors who repair voting machines
 
00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:50.480 align:start position:0%
to register with the secretary of state
 
00:03:53.869 --> 00:03:53.879 align:start position:0%
and the attorney general and obtain and
 
00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:56.760 align:start position:0%
in in that process obtain a registration
 
00:03:59.830 --> 00:03:59.840 align:start position:0%
number they will get in order to present
 
00:04:01.589 --> 00:04:01.599 align:start position:0%
proof of bonding and
 
00:04:04.949 --> 00:04:04.959 align:start position:0%
insurance uh and it also permits them to
 
00:04:07.949 --> 00:04:07.959 align:start position:0%
obtain a contractor
 
00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:12.640 align:start position:0%
ID prior to working on or accessing any
 
00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:15.079 align:start position:0%
voting machine that these contractors
 
00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:18.440 align:start position:0%
are to present to the local official uh
 
00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:21.120 align:start position:0%
that photo ID with the name the
 
00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:23.160 align:start position:0%
company's name the registration number
 
00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:26.520 align:start position:0%
and then have that ID visibly available
 
00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:30.520 align:start position:0%
at all times the local official will
 
00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:34.560 align:start position:0%
record that information on the device
 
00:04:37.469 --> 00:04:37.479 align:start position:0%
log the bill requires the Secretary of
 
00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:39.560 align:start position:0%
State to provide training on all these
 
00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:43.240 align:start position:0%
measures it should be very D Minimus
 
00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:44.720 align:start position:0%
simple addition to their current
 
00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:46.070 align:start position:0%
simple addition to their current
procedural

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:46.080 align:start position:0%
procedural
 
00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:50.080 align:start position:0%
manual um but I will make one comment
 
00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:52.720 align:start position:0%
here assuming you accept this bill I
 
00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:55.080 align:start position:0%
would ask you to make an an
 
00:04:58.310 --> 00:04:58.320 align:start position:0%
amendment uh when I was working with OLS
 
00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:00.320 align:start position:0%
they did not change
 
00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:03.560 align:start position:0%
the Attorney General uh to the
 
00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:05.240 align:start position:0%
Department of
 
00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:08.560 align:start position:0%
Insurance the uh insurance and bonding
 
00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:10.360 align:start position:0%
activities that are
 
00:05:13.469 --> 00:05:13.479 align:start position:0%
required uh are done by the insurance
 
00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:16.440 align:start position:0%
department and the enforcement unit
 
00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:20.600 align:start position:0%
thereof so it the AG is inappropriately
 
00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:22.680 align:start position:0%
called out in this bill it should be the
 
00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:24.960 align:start position:0%
insurance department in order to take
 
00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:27.280 align:start position:0%
care of the the bonding and insurance
 
00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:31.840 align:start position:0%
and any um Associated enforcement which
 
00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:35.440 align:start position:0%
is all part of their daily
 
00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:38.280 align:start position:0%
activity uh the rationale for the bill
 
00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:41.080 align:start position:0%
is simple this this is a election
 
00:05:44.749 --> 00:05:44.759 align:start position:0%
Integrity uh concern bonding ensures a
 
00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:47.360 align:start position:0%
contractor will be vetted by the shity
 
00:05:50.029 --> 00:05:50.039 align:start position:0%
company and can be can be considered
 
00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:52.560 align:start position:0%
reliable enhances the likelihood of the
 
00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:54.960 align:start position:0%
work's going to be completed as required
 
00:05:57.189 --> 00:05:57.199 align:start position:0%
and protecting against any any
 
00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:00.600 align:start position:0%
substantial or faulty work um so with
 
00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:03.280 align:start position:0%
that I'm happy to answer any questions
 
00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:05.400 align:start position:0%
from the committee are there questions
 
00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:07.400 align:start position:0%
from the committee representative L you
 
00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:09.120 align:start position:0%
recognized um thank you and thank you
 
00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:12.240 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um is is this not
 
00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:15.280 align:start position:0%
done now by the SOS I Secretary of State
 
00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:19.960 align:start position:0%
do you know no okay and follow up okay I
 
00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:21.800 align:start position:0%
follow yep of course just got to do my
 
00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:25.560 align:start position:0%
procedure I just
 
00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:28.560 align:start position:0%
um I guess it seems like
 
00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:31.080 align:start position:0%
a and I don't know maybe I wait till
 
00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:33.440 align:start position:0%
Secor say I wondered if there's the same
 
00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:36.120 align:start position:0%
contractor for all the machines if you
 
00:06:38.309 --> 00:06:38.319 align:start position:0%
if you know whether or not that's the
 
00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:41.160 align:start position:0%
case well up until recently we only had
 
00:06:43.629 --> 00:06:43.639 align:start position:0%
one class of machines so the contractors
 
00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:46.840 align:start position:0%
working on them would be all from one
 
00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:49.000 align:start position:0%
company now there's two classes of
 
00:06:51.309 --> 00:06:51.319 align:start position:0%
machines so I would expect there would
 
00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:53.720 align:start position:0%
be different
 
00:06:56.430 --> 00:06:56.440 align:start position:0%
contractors further questions from the
 
00:06:59.230 --> 00:06:59.240 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none thank you uh next
 
00:07:05.029 --> 00:07:05.039 align:start position:0%

approve HB 711 but only with the with an
 
00:07:52.550 --> 00:07:52.560 align:start position:0%
addition to the existing Bill to include
 
00:07:54.469 --> 00:07:54.479 align:start position:0%
the following language or words
 
00:07:56.670 --> 00:07:56.680 align:start position:0%
resulting in the same action I quote
 
00:07:58.749 --> 00:07:58.759 align:start position:0%
where New Hampshire is an OSHA State any
 
00:08:00.510 --> 00:08:00.520 align:start position:0%
and all elect elic voting machine
 
00:08:03.149 --> 00:08:03.159 align:start position:0%
contractors shall maintain all OSHA
 
00:08:05.510 --> 00:08:05.520 align:start position:0%
safety certification requirements for
 
00:08:07.469 --> 00:08:07.479 align:start position:0%
all electronic voting machines for the
 
00:08:09.670 --> 00:08:09.680 align:start position:0%
safety and protection of New Hampshire
 
00:08:12.510 --> 00:08:12.520 align:start position:0%
election officials and staff end quote
 
00:08:14.909 --> 00:08:14.919 align:start position:0%
on September 7th 2021 I submitted an
 
00:08:17.189 --> 00:08:17.199 align:start position:0%
expert witness preliminary report my
 
00:08:19.670 --> 00:08:19.680 align:start position:0%
report in the case of Richard versus
 
00:08:22.469 --> 00:08:22.479 align:start position:0%
sununu my report unfortunately exposed a
 
00:08:23.909 --> 00:08:23.919 align:start position:0%
number of both state and federal
 
00:08:26.230 --> 00:08:26.240 align:start position:0%
violations that the majority if not all
 
00:08:28.469 --> 00:08:28.479 align:start position:0%
existing electronic tabulating voting
 
00:08:30.950 --> 00:08:30.960 align:start position:0%
machines currently possess my conclusion
 
00:08:33.190 --> 00:08:33.200 align:start position:0%
read I recommend New Hampshire cease
 
00:08:35.190 --> 00:08:35.200 align:start position:0%
using all ACU vote machines and any
 
00:08:36.990 --> 00:08:37.000 align:start position:0%
other electronic tabulating voting
 
00:08:39.430 --> 00:08:39.440 align:start position:0%
system or device experiencing the same
 
00:08:41.670 --> 00:08:41.680 align:start position:0%
maintenance and operation currently New
 
00:08:43.230 --> 00:08:43.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire does not have a federally
 
00:08:45.790 --> 00:08:45.800 align:start position:0%
approved and required state plan which
 
00:08:47.790 --> 00:08:47.800 align:start position:0%
is at least as effective as the federal
 
00:08:50.070 --> 00:08:50.080 align:start position:0%
OSHA regulations this would include
 
00:08:52.190 --> 00:08:52.200 align:start position:0%
safety certification for all electronic
 
00:08:54.590 --> 00:08:54.600 align:start position:0%
devices and systems used by the public
 
00:08:56.790 --> 00:08:56.800 align:start position:0%
and private workers if this were not
 
00:08:58.710 --> 00:08:58.720 align:start position:0%
true all Antiquated and modified
 
00:09:00.790 --> 00:09:00.800 align:start position:0%
machines would not be legally permitted
 
00:09:03.509 --> 00:09:03.519 align:start position:0%
in use today to my dismay that I report
 
00:09:05.310 --> 00:09:05.320 align:start position:0%
to this committee that all Antiquated
 
00:09:07.670 --> 00:09:07.680 align:start position:0%
and modified electronic voting machines
 
00:09:09.269 --> 00:09:09.279 align:start position:0%
in this state have been and are
 
00:09:12.030 --> 00:09:12.040 align:start position:0%
currently used unlawfully as outlined in
 
00:09:13.430 --> 00:09:13.440 align:start position:0%
my September
 
00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:15.949 align:start position:0%
my September

report uh and he just unders sworn to
 
00:09:20.069 --> 00:09:20.079 align:start position:0%
pains and penalties and I have his
 
00:09:21.110 --> 00:09:21.120 align:start position:0%
report for
 
00:09:23.190 --> 00:09:23.200 align:start position:0%
you okay thank you will you be taking
 
00:09:26.069 --> 00:09:26.079 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee I'll try
 
00:09:27.230 --> 00:09:27.240 align:start position:0%
Okay are there questions from the
 
00:09:29.590 --> 00:09:29.600 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none thank you thank
 
00:09:31.630 --> 00:09:31.640 align:start position:0%
you uh next up is Al
 
00:09:38.190 --> 00:09:38.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:41.710 --> 00:09:41.720 align:start position:0%
Kensington welcome to election
 
00:09:44.910 --> 00:09:44.920 align:start position:0%
law yep so we put that we new policy
 
00:09:46.949 --> 00:09:46.959 align:start position:0%
this year we put every unless it's uh is
 
00:09:48.310 --> 00:09:48.320 align:start position:0%
this copies of your written testimony or
 
00:09:49.949 --> 00:09:49.959 align:start position:0%
is this a document you need Rel that
 
00:09:51.110 --> 00:09:51.120 align:start position:0%
you're going to be
 
00:09:52.790 --> 00:09:52.800 align:start position:0%
referencing okay document can be
 
00:09:54.710 --> 00:09:54.720 align:start position:0%
referenced as can be distributed um but
 
00:09:56.150 --> 00:09:56.160 align:start position:0%
if it's a copy of your testimony it just
 
00:10:14.790 --> 00:10:14.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:17.829 --> 00:10:17.839 align:start position:0%
oh Al brand Deno from Kensington New
 
00:10:21.790 --> 00:10:21.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um first of all this is common
 
00:10:24.069 --> 00:10:24.079 align:start position:0%
sense when you think about it I'm a
 
00:10:27.069 --> 00:10:27.079 align:start position:0%
youth H hockey coach um and a high
 
00:10:29.389 --> 00:10:29.399 align:start position:0%
school hockey coach in the past and I
 
00:10:31.389 --> 00:10:31.399 align:start position:0%
have to have a background check if
 
00:10:33.430 --> 00:10:33.440 align:start position:0%
you're a kidgoten teacher or you run
 
00:10:35.710 --> 00:10:35.720 align:start position:0%
anything you have a background check
 
00:10:37.790 --> 00:10:37.800 align:start position:0%
this is common sense that people are
 
00:10:40.190 --> 00:10:40.200 align:start position:0%
working on our machines and we really
 
00:10:41.509 --> 00:10:41.519 align:start position:0%
don't know who they
 
00:10:43.910 --> 00:10:43.920 align:start position:0%
are and what I did is I gave you an
 
00:10:46.750 --> 00:10:46.760 align:start position:0%
example of this first of all this is all
 
00:10:50.150 --> 00:10:50.160 align:start position:0%
part of the Senate District 24 uh review
 
00:10:53.430 --> 00:10:53.440 align:start position:0%
from April 5th 2023 that um
 
00:10:56.150 --> 00:10:56.160 align:start position:0%
unfortunately this body elected not to
 
00:10:57.550 --> 00:10:57.560 align:start position:0%
move forward
 
00:11:00.790 --> 00:11:00.800 align:start position:0%
with um so here's just a simple example
 
00:11:02.550 --> 00:11:02.560 align:start position:0%
of over
 
00:11:06.350 --> 00:11:06.360 align:start position:0%
150 uh we have activity logs which are
 
00:11:08.470 --> 00:11:08.480 align:start position:0%
uh affidavits if you look at the bottom
 
00:11:11.710 --> 00:11:11.720 align:start position:0%
of the a the of the activity log it's an
 
00:11:14.150 --> 00:11:14.160 align:start position:0%
actual affidavit it's an RSA and an
 
00:11:16.790 --> 00:11:16.800 align:start position:0%
affidavit and you'll find uh and not
 
00:11:18.590 --> 00:11:18.600 align:start position:0%
only places where people are not
 
00:11:20.670 --> 00:11:20.680 align:start position:0%
witnessed a second witness was is
 
00:11:23.470 --> 00:11:23.480 align:start position:0%
required by law but you'll find that
 
00:11:26.110 --> 00:11:26.120 align:start position:0%
when someone does a repair on a machine
 
00:11:28.310 --> 00:11:28.320 align:start position:0%
it says repair and you can't read the
 
00:11:30.150 --> 00:11:30.160 align:start position:0%
person's name
 
00:11:32.310 --> 00:11:32.320 align:start position:0%
now why is that important believe it or
 
00:11:34.269 --> 00:11:34.279 align:start position:0%
not because I live in Kensington I
 
00:11:37.829 --> 00:11:37.839 align:start position:0%
looked at the contract for LHS LHS can
 
00:11:40.750 --> 00:11:40.760 align:start position:0%
hire subcontractors to work on machines
 
00:11:42.550 --> 00:11:42.560 align:start position:0%
they don't all all necessarily have to
 
00:11:45.030 --> 00:11:45.040 align:start position:0%
have a contractor their contractor it
 
00:11:46.829 --> 00:11:46.839 align:start position:0%
could be a subcontractor according to
 
00:11:49.150 --> 00:11:49.160 align:start position:0%
their contracts and I'm sure with a new
 
00:11:52.629 --> 00:11:52.639 align:start position:0%
machine company that's joined the same
 
00:11:54.389 --> 00:11:54.399 align:start position:0%
um and once again you'll see it here in
 
00:11:56.430 --> 00:11:56.440 align:start position:0%
the next one just kind of pointing it
 
00:11:58.750 --> 00:11:58.760 align:start position:0%
out one the affidavits aren't properly
 
00:12:01.350 --> 00:12:01.360 align:start position:0%
executed Ed and two uh maintenance on
 
00:12:03.670 --> 00:12:03.680 align:start position:0%
the machines we don't know who that
 
00:12:06.990 --> 00:12:07.000 align:start position:0%
person is nor does the town clerk uh
 
00:12:09.269 --> 00:12:09.279 align:start position:0%
unless they have a certified badge
 
00:12:11.829 --> 00:12:11.839 align:start position:0%
number or it's recorded somewhere on
 
00:12:14.269 --> 00:12:14.279 align:start position:0%
this so citizens know who worked on
 
00:12:17.990 --> 00:12:18.000 align:start position:0%
their machines um it's basic Integrity
 
00:12:19.990 --> 00:12:20.000 align:start position:0%
um and I'll take any questions are
 
00:12:21.269 --> 00:12:21.279 align:start position:0%
questions from the
 
00:12:25.269 --> 00:12:25.279 align:start position:0%
committee sigan thank you uh next up
 
00:12:32.829 --> 00:12:32.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:32.839 --> 00:12:33.829 align:start position:0%
 
welcome

00:12:33.829 --> 00:12:33.839 align:start position:0%
welcome
 
00:12:37.069 --> 00:12:37.079 align:start position:0%
back long time no
 
00:12:40.269 --> 00:12:40.279 align:start position:0%
see Lyn Briggs amris New
 
00:12:43.750 --> 00:12:43.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh I am a government approved
 
00:12:46.590 --> 00:12:46.600 align:start position:0%
election staff person which is a ballot
 
00:12:49.069 --> 00:12:49.079 align:start position:0%
Clerk and that is officially approved by
 
00:12:50.670 --> 00:12:50.680 align:start position:0%
the government for both the town and
 
00:12:52.990 --> 00:12:53.000 align:start position:0%
state primary and full elections I need
 
00:12:56.069 --> 00:12:56.079 align:start position:0%
my glasses my complaint is that the
 
00:12:57.949 --> 00:12:57.959 align:start position:0%
safety and efficacy of these Dominion
 
00:12:59.750 --> 00:12:59.760 align:start position:0%
ACU votee machines they were not voted
 
00:13:01.990 --> 00:13:02.000 align:start position:0%
on number one by We the People the state
 
00:13:04.590 --> 00:13:04.600 align:start position:0%
bought from and hired LHS to maintain
 
00:13:07.150 --> 00:13:07.160 align:start position:0%
all these machines and the memory cards
 
00:13:09.389 --> 00:13:09.399 align:start position:0%
and to note that officially LHS was
 
00:13:11.509 --> 00:13:11.519 align:start position:0%
never certified by Dominion who H who
 
00:13:13.710 --> 00:13:13.720 align:start position:0%
owns and sells the machines these
 
00:13:15.670 --> 00:13:15.680 align:start position:0%
machines were knowingly modified there
 
00:13:17.910 --> 00:13:17.920 align:start position:0%
is a directive by the Secretary of State
 
00:13:20.310 --> 00:13:20.320 align:start position:0%
to cut the wires I'll keep it Street
 
00:13:22.430 --> 00:13:22.440 align:start position:0%
Talk per the directive of himself
 
00:13:24.150 --> 00:13:24.160 align:start position:0%
scandin further evidenced by the
 
00:13:26.790 --> 00:13:26.800 align:start position:0%
testimony in 2021 at Rockingham Superior
 
00:13:29.590 --> 00:13:29.600 align:start position:0%
Court further evidenced by by there's a
 
00:13:31.550 --> 00:13:31.560 align:start position:0%
book by the results of Windom recount
 
00:13:33.910 --> 00:13:33.920 align:start position:0%
and there's snapshots and screenshots of
 
00:13:36.110 --> 00:13:36.120 align:start position:0%
the actual cutting of these wires in the
 
00:13:38.710 --> 00:13:38.720 align:start position:0%
machines there has also been several
 
00:13:41.710 --> 00:13:41.720 align:start position:0%
instances in marac uh nasua where they
 
00:13:43.430 --> 00:13:43.440 align:start position:0%
take parts from other machines and put
 
00:13:46.069 --> 00:13:46.079 align:start position:0%
them into the current machines which
 
00:13:48.269 --> 00:13:48.279 align:start position:0%
therefore therefore nullifies the
 
00:13:50.389 --> 00:13:50.399 align:start position:0%
certification by modifying these
 
00:13:52.829 --> 00:13:52.839 align:start position:0%
machines the accuracy of the vote tally
 
00:13:55.509 --> 00:13:55.519 align:start position:0%
cannot be validated there are also
 
00:13:58.590 --> 00:13:58.600 align:start position:0%
unknown unforeseen medical issues
 
00:14:00.590 --> 00:14:00.600 align:start position:0%
further these ACU vote machines have not
 
00:14:03.069 --> 00:14:03.079 align:start position:0%
been safety certified since the first
 
00:14:05.910 --> 00:14:05.920 align:start position:0%
maintenance Andor part replacement this
 
00:14:08.749 --> 00:14:08.759 align:start position:0%
is Decades of not being safety certified
 
00:14:11.949 --> 00:14:11.959 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is an OSHA State thank you
 
00:14:14.230 --> 00:14:14.240 align:start position:0%
and I do have which I won't go into
 
00:14:16.590 --> 00:14:16.600 align:start position:0%
right now but um in going through the
 
00:14:19.069 --> 00:14:19.079 align:start position:0%
records in Amherst I can show that a
 
00:14:20.949 --> 00:14:20.959 align:start position:0%
clock chip on the same machine was
 
00:14:23.350 --> 00:14:23.360 align:start position:0%
changed two months in a row I have
 
00:14:25.710 --> 00:14:25.720 align:start position:0%
invoices showing the maintenance they
 
00:14:28.470 --> 00:14:28.480 align:start position:0%
don't have signatures um I also have
 
00:14:30.670 --> 00:14:30.680 align:start position:0%
information from a recount an official
 
00:14:33.030 --> 00:14:33.040 align:start position:0%
recount that shows the problems with the
 
00:14:35.509 --> 00:14:35.519 align:start position:0%
machines and I have the facts uh of the
 
00:14:37.189 --> 00:14:37.199 align:start position:0%
case of the law from that we sent to
 
00:14:39.670 --> 00:14:39.680 align:start position:0%
OSHA if that would help sure um and it
 
00:14:41.310 --> 00:14:41.320 align:start position:0%
doesn't think you have 20 copies of that
 
00:14:42.509 --> 00:14:42.519 align:start position:0%
so I assume that it's going to go to the
 
00:14:46.350 --> 00:14:46.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:48.509 --> 00:14:48.519 align:start position:0%
testimony uh or I can just leave this
 
00:14:49.430 --> 00:14:49.440 align:start position:0%
with you that's what I'm saying you
 
00:14:51.310 --> 00:14:51.320 align:start position:0%
would go to the clerk oh okay yeah yeah
 
00:14:52.990 --> 00:14:53.000 align:start position:0%
we're saying the same thing okay yeah
 
00:14:54.069 --> 00:14:54.079 align:start position:0%
you don't have copies for distribution
 
00:14:56.069 --> 00:14:56.079 align:start position:0%
you just have copies no no no no no
 
00:14:57.790 --> 00:14:57.800 align:start position:0%
doing this last second yep totally fine
 
00:15:01.350 --> 00:15:01.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:02.749 --> 00:15:02.759 align:start position:0%
yeah I assuming you're taking questions
 
00:15:02.759 --> 00:15:03.590 align:start position:0%
yeah I assuming you're taking questions
M

00:15:03.590 --> 00:15:03.600 align:start position:0%
M
 
00:15:05.670 --> 00:15:05.680 align:start position:0%
BRS and thank you for taking the
 
00:15:08.069 --> 00:15:08.079 align:start position:0%
questions um you indicated that the
 
00:15:11.829 --> 00:15:11.839 align:start position:0%
accuracy cannot be verified um I mean we
 
00:15:14.269 --> 00:15:14.279 align:start position:0%
have numerous recounts and audits of
 
00:15:16.389 --> 00:15:16.399 align:start position:0%
these machines I guess I'm a little
 
00:15:18.550 --> 00:15:18.560 align:start position:0%
confused by your statement so the
 
00:15:20.910 --> 00:15:20.920 align:start position:0%
accuracy um because they have been
 
00:15:23.189 --> 00:15:23.199 align:start position:0%
modified because Parts have been
 
00:15:25.389 --> 00:15:25.399 align:start position:0%
replaced from the point of view from
 
00:15:27.629 --> 00:15:27.639 align:start position:0%
OSHA that anything that has not been
 
00:15:30.389 --> 00:15:30.399 align:start position:0%
safety re safety C ified you cannot
 
00:15:32.509 --> 00:15:32.519 align:start position:0%
verify the accuracy just from that point
 
00:15:35.110 --> 00:15:35.120 align:start position:0%
of Maintenance in the actual
 
00:15:37.350 --> 00:15:37.360 align:start position:0%
machine further
 
00:15:39.550 --> 00:15:39.560 align:start position:0%
questions sing Oh yes have
 
00:15:43.189 --> 00:15:43.199 align:start position:0%
representative PR O'Brien thank you Mr
 
00:15:46.189 --> 00:15:46.199 align:start position:0%
chairman are you're talking also about
 
00:15:49.150 --> 00:15:49.160 align:start position:0%
safety for people using these machines
 
00:15:51.110 --> 00:15:51.120 align:start position:0%
but these are not Machine Tools I'm not
 
00:15:53.949 --> 00:15:53.959 align:start position:0%
I'm a little confused about why there's
 
00:15:56.069 --> 00:15:56.079 align:start position:0%
the OSHA connection I guess you just
 
00:15:57.990 --> 00:15:58.000 align:start position:0%
covered that OSHA connection but could
 
00:15:59.509 --> 00:15:59.519 align:start position:0%
you talk about why you're concerned
 
00:16:01.590 --> 00:16:01.600 align:start position:0%
about operator
 
00:16:04.509 --> 00:16:04.519 align:start position:0%
safety um that's not my area of
 
00:16:06.509 --> 00:16:06.519 align:start position:0%
expertise I have talked about it before
 
00:16:08.309 --> 00:16:08.319 align:start position:0%
that is actually Mr Wayne say it that
 
00:16:10.150 --> 00:16:10.160 align:start position:0%
would be someone you'd want to speak to
 
00:16:12.309 --> 00:16:12.319 align:start position:0%
but it is my understanding because once
 
00:16:17.309 --> 00:16:17.319 align:start position:0%
you have um uh modified the machines we
 
00:16:20.069 --> 00:16:20.079 align:start position:0%
cannot tell what is going on with it we
 
00:16:21.870 --> 00:16:21.880 align:start position:0%
can't tell if it's putting out any kind
 
00:16:24.389 --> 00:16:24.399 align:start position:0%
of electronic pulses or anything like
 
00:16:26.189 --> 00:16:26.199 align:start position:0%
that and that was the point of view that
 
00:16:28.189 --> 00:16:28.199 align:start position:0%
was brought up at another meeting but
 
00:16:30.710 --> 00:16:30.720 align:start position:0%
that's his area of expertise further
 
00:16:33.269 --> 00:16:33.279 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee seeing none
 
00:16:36.350 --> 00:16:36.360 align:start position:0%

Association although it looks like we're
 
00:16:49.430 --> 00:16:49.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:51.749 --> 00:16:51.759 align:start position:0%
entry good morning my name is Sarah
 
00:16:54.230 --> 00:16:54.240 align:start position:0%
Burke Cohen I am from the New Hampshire
 
00:16:58.189 --> 00:16:58.199 align:start position:0%
Municipal Association I am here to speak
 
00:17:00.990 --> 00:17:01.000 align:start position:0%
to you as we oppose this bill um we
 
00:17:04.390 --> 00:17:04.400 align:start position:0%
oppose this bill because uh there is for
 
00:17:07.110 --> 00:17:07.120 align:start position:0%
the municipalities there seems to be um
 
00:17:10.669 --> 00:17:10.679 align:start position:0%
either some confusion on um you know
 
00:17:13.990 --> 00:17:14.000 align:start position:0%
who's a designated Municipal uh official
 
00:17:16.630 --> 00:17:16.640 align:start position:0%
who photographic identification is
 
00:17:20.230 --> 00:17:20.240 align:start position:0%
presented to um you know how does the
 
00:17:22.189 --> 00:17:22.199 align:start position:0%
registration process work how does the
 
00:17:23.549 --> 00:17:23.559 align:start position:0%
municipality ensure that the
 
00:17:26.630 --> 00:17:26.640 align:start position:0%
registration number is valid or not
 
00:17:30.070 --> 00:17:30.080 align:start position:0%
expired um so the municipal Association
 
00:17:32.710 --> 00:17:32.720 align:start position:0%
opposes this um in terms of there seems
 
00:17:35.350 --> 00:17:35.360 align:start position:0%
to be some ambiguity in this bill still
 
00:17:37.350 --> 00:17:37.360 align:start position:0%
um when it comes uh to municipalities
 
00:17:40.549 --> 00:17:40.559 align:start position:0%
and how they are supposed to process
 
00:17:43.110 --> 00:17:43.120 align:start position:0%
this I'll take questions questions from
 
00:17:45.830 --> 00:17:45.840 align:start position:0%
the committee represent of
 
00:17:48.630 --> 00:17:48.640 align:start position:0%
Lane thank you um you may not know the
 
00:17:51.950 --> 00:17:51.960 align:start position:0%
answer to this but I'm gonna ask um who
 
00:17:55.430 --> 00:17:55.440 align:start position:0%
asks for the machines to be fixed is
 
00:17:57.710 --> 00:17:57.720 align:start position:0%
that the towns and the cities the
 
00:18:00.750 --> 00:18:00.760 align:start position:0%
municipalities or or do they and do they
 
00:18:03.110 --> 00:18:03.120 align:start position:0%
work with um secretary of state so
 
00:18:05.789 --> 00:18:05.799 align:start position:0%
that's actually two questions sorry I'm
 
00:18:08.190 --> 00:18:08.200 align:start position:0%
not entirely sure but I can look into
 
00:18:10.750 --> 00:18:10.760 align:start position:0%
that and I think that there may be some
 
00:18:12.470 --> 00:18:12.480 align:start position:0%
testimony on that in a few minutes that
 
00:18:14.789 --> 00:18:14.799 align:start position:0%
can maybe go into some greater detail
 
00:18:16.710 --> 00:18:16.720 align:start position:0%
relative to the
 
00:18:18.590 --> 00:18:18.600 align:start position:0%
machines questions from the committee
 
00:18:21.510 --> 00:18:21.520 align:start position:0%
further questions seeing none thank you
 
00:18:23.590 --> 00:18:23.600 align:start position:0%

00:18:25.430 --> 00:18:25.440 align:start position:0%

gasowski can you grab the blue sheet for
 
00:18:27.159 --> 00:18:32.270 align:start position:0%

00:18:32.270 --> 00:18:32.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:33.950 --> 00:18:33.960 align:start position:0%
good morning everyone Aaron Hennessy
 
00:18:35.669 --> 00:18:35.679 align:start position:0%
deputy secretary of state thank you Mr
 
00:18:38.909 --> 00:18:38.919 align:start position:0%
chair I am happy to answer any questions
 
00:18:40.750 --> 00:18:40.760 align:start position:0%
you have but first I just want to go
 
00:18:43.430 --> 00:18:43.440 align:start position:0%
over a few um language concerns I have
 
00:18:47.470 --> 00:18:47.480 align:start position:0%
with the bill um first um we have
 
00:18:49.549 --> 00:18:49.559 align:start position:0%
currently we have two vendors in the
 
00:18:53.270 --> 00:18:53.280 align:start position:0%
state we use the term vendor um so if
 
00:18:54.590 --> 00:18:54.600 align:start position:0%
you would like to use the word
 
00:18:56.350 --> 00:18:56.360 align:start position:0%
contractor we would like that to be
 
00:18:58.789 --> 00:18:58.799 align:start position:0%
defined by exactly what you mean by that
 
00:19:01.830 --> 00:19:01.840 align:start position:0%
do you mean the um company the vendor of
 
00:19:04.470 --> 00:19:04.480 align:start position:0%
the electronic ballot counting devices
 
00:19:07.669 --> 00:19:07.679 align:start position:0%
or do you mean somebody who maybe um the
 
00:19:10.870 --> 00:19:10.880 align:start position:0%
town clerk has called in to do something
 
00:19:13.190 --> 00:19:13.200 align:start position:0%
separate from what they who they've um
 
00:19:14.870 --> 00:19:14.880 align:start position:0%
who the vendor is for the device that
 
00:19:17.230 --> 00:19:17.240 align:start position:0%
they've purchased it from um so please
 
00:19:19.470 --> 00:19:19.480 align:start position:0%
define the word vendor I'm contractor
 
00:19:22.470 --> 00:19:22.480 align:start position:0%
excuse me also um we're unclear about
 
00:19:24.630 --> 00:19:24.640 align:start position:0%
what the bond is for who you're bonding
 
00:19:26.390 --> 00:19:26.400 align:start position:0%
if you're bonding the individual who's
 
00:19:28.310 --> 00:19:28.320 align:start position:0%
working on the equipment or if you're
 
00:19:32.789 --> 00:19:32.799 align:start position:0%
bonding the um the company who has um
 
00:19:35.149 --> 00:19:35.159 align:start position:0%
distributed that equipment who the town
 
00:19:37.630 --> 00:19:37.640 align:start position:0%
or city has purchased the equipment from
 
00:19:40.149 --> 00:19:40.159 align:start position:0%
we are not involved in the purchasing uh
 
00:19:43.190 --> 00:19:43.200 align:start position:0%
of the devices each um individual town
 
00:19:45.750 --> 00:19:45.760 align:start position:0%
or city purchases the devices themselves
 
00:19:47.710 --> 00:19:47.720 align:start position:0%
from the two vendors in the state
 
00:19:49.870 --> 00:19:49.880 align:start position:0%
currently we have three devices that can
 
00:19:52.909 --> 00:19:52.919 align:start position:0%
be purchased um these devices are
 
00:19:55.070 --> 00:19:55.080 align:start position:0%
authorized by the ballot law commission
 
00:19:59.190 --> 00:19:59.200 align:start position:0%
from New Hampshire and um they are l and
 
00:20:02.830 --> 00:20:02.840 align:start position:0%
voting works and I am not aware that
 
00:20:05.149 --> 00:20:05.159 align:start position:0%
they use any subcontractors to do any
 
00:20:08.270 --> 00:20:08.280 align:start position:0%
work on the devices themselves they um
 
00:20:10.710 --> 00:20:10.720 align:start position:0%
they themselves do the work if it's
 
00:20:14.270 --> 00:20:14.280 align:start position:0%
maintenance on a um ball counting device
 
00:20:16.470 --> 00:20:16.480 align:start position:0%
or if something goes wrong um during the
 
00:20:19.029 --> 00:20:19.039 align:start position:0%
testing of the device uh the city or
 
00:20:20.909 --> 00:20:20.919 align:start position:0%
town clerk will call the vendor and the
 
00:20:22.990 --> 00:20:23.000 align:start position:0%
vendor will either troubleshoot it over
 
00:20:24.830 --> 00:20:24.840 align:start position:0%
the phone or show up in
 
00:20:27.870 --> 00:20:27.880 align:start position:0%
person we also don't know um who is
 
00:20:29.230 --> 00:20:29.240 align:start position:0%
going to be respons responsible for
 
00:20:32.230 --> 00:20:32.240 align:start position:0%
making the photo IDs to my knowledge I
 
00:20:34.070 --> 00:20:34.080 align:start position:0%
don't think that these vendors have
 
00:20:37.549 --> 00:20:37.559 align:start position:0%
photo IDs for their employees um and how
 
00:20:39.830 --> 00:20:39.840 align:start position:0%
will the city or town clerk know that
 
00:20:42.390 --> 00:20:42.400 align:start position:0%
that is an authorized photo ID I think
 
00:20:44.909 --> 00:20:44.919 align:start position:0%
the municipal Association spoke to that
 
00:20:47.950 --> 00:20:47.960 align:start position:0%
briefly um I think those are what the
 
00:20:49.590 --> 00:20:49.600 align:start position:0%
clarifications that we would need I'm
 
00:20:51.950 --> 00:20:51.960 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions questions
 
00:20:52.950 --> 00:20:52.960 align:start position:0%
from the
 
00:20:55.789 --> 00:20:55.799 align:start position:0%
committee representative where thank you
 
00:20:57.750 --> 00:20:57.760 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and thank you deputy secretary
 
00:21:00.590 --> 00:21:00.600 align:start position:0%
for taking my question the um I believe
 
00:21:02.549 --> 00:21:02.559 align:start position:0%
the voting works as the open source
 
00:21:05.350 --> 00:21:05.360 align:start position:0%
software and therefore has capability of
 
00:21:07.990 --> 00:21:08.000 align:start position:0%
programming by people other
 
00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:09.909 align:start position:0%
programming by people other
than

00:21:09.909 --> 00:21:09.919 align:start position:0%
than
 
00:21:14.230 --> 00:21:14.240 align:start position:0%
um the cont the vendor um is is that a
 
00:21:16.990 --> 00:21:17.000 align:start position:0%
correct statement or is thank you for
 
00:21:20.029 --> 00:21:20.039 align:start position:0%
the question um you are correct that
 
00:21:21.750 --> 00:21:21.760 align:start position:0%
they have open- Source software but that
 
00:21:24.870 --> 00:21:24.880 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean that it is open source to
 
00:21:28.630 --> 00:21:28.640 align:start position:0%
everyone um the vendor uh is voting
 
00:21:30.990 --> 00:21:31.000 align:start position:0%
works and they are the company that the
 
00:21:33.750 --> 00:21:33.760 align:start position:0%
clerk would reach out to if there was a
 
00:21:35.870 --> 00:21:35.880 align:start position:0%
an issue with the device themselves and
 
00:21:37.830 --> 00:21:37.840 align:start position:0%
they are the vendor that would update
 
00:21:39.390 --> 00:21:39.400 align:start position:0%
the software if a new version is
 
00:21:41.630 --> 00:21:41.640 align:start position:0%
approved by a battle law commission but
 
00:21:44.549 --> 00:21:44.559 align:start position:0%
anyone can look at that coding and if
 
00:21:46.870 --> 00:21:46.880 align:start position:0%
they can understand coding they can
 
00:21:50.149 --> 00:21:50.159 align:start position:0%
understand it but it's not open to
 
00:21:50.159 --> 00:21:51.470 align:start position:0%
understand it but it's not open to
external

00:21:51.470 --> 00:21:51.480 align:start position:0%
external
 
00:21:53.149 --> 00:21:53.159 align:start position:0%
coding further questions from the
 
00:21:55.070 --> 00:21:55.080 align:start position:0%
committee representative where your
 
00:21:59.310 --> 00:21:59.320 align:start position:0%
followup yes thank you Mr chair um I'm
 
00:22:01.430 --> 00:22:01.440 align:start position:0%
recalling this from memory so it it
 
00:22:04.549 --> 00:22:04.559 align:start position:0%
could be very faulty but the it was my
 
00:22:06.230 --> 00:22:06.240 align:start position:0%
understanding that there was uh
 
00:22:07.750 --> 00:22:07.760 align:start position:0%
extensible markup language that they
 
00:22:10.070 --> 00:22:10.080 align:start position:0%
were using for programming the voting
 
00:22:13.310 --> 00:22:13.320 align:start position:0%
Works machines and that that there was I
 
00:22:14.669 --> 00:22:14.679 align:start position:0%
thought when they appeared before the
 
00:22:16.750 --> 00:22:16.760 align:start position:0%
ballot law commission they talked about
 
00:22:19.230 --> 00:22:19.240 align:start position:0%
having capabilities to have local
 
00:22:23.750 --> 00:22:23.760 align:start position:0%
programming but I I I could be wrong so
 
00:22:26.430 --> 00:22:26.440 align:start position:0%
I I'm I'm just curious if you remember
 
00:22:28.190 --> 00:22:28.200 align:start position:0%
anything about that thank thank you for
 
00:22:29.149 --> 00:22:29.159 align:start position:0%
the question and I think you're
 
00:22:31.269 --> 00:22:31.279 align:start position:0%
referring to that if
 
00:22:34.110 --> 00:22:34.120 align:start position:0%
um if they have a voting Works device
 
00:22:37.070 --> 00:22:37.080 align:start position:0%
and they um they've bought the option to
 
00:22:40.990 --> 00:22:41.000 align:start position:0%
do it local clerks can um design their
 
00:22:43.590 --> 00:22:43.600 align:start position:0%
ballots for their local elections but
 
00:22:45.909 --> 00:22:45.919 align:start position:0%
they are just importing the candidates
 
00:22:49.269 --> 00:22:49.279 align:start position:0%
names and the questions they're not
 
00:22:51.630 --> 00:22:51.640 align:start position:0%
programming the functioning of the
 
00:22:55.590 --> 00:22:55.600 align:start position:0%
device and I'm not I'm not an IT
 
00:22:57.390 --> 00:22:57.400 align:start position:0%
person further questions from the
 
00:22:59.230 --> 00:22:59.240 align:start position:0%

electronic ballot counting device memory
 
00:24:43.549 --> 00:24:43.559 align:start position:0%

absentee ballot applications affidavit
 
00:24:48.310 --> 00:24:48.320 align:start position:0%
envelopes and lists we believe that the
 
00:24:51.110 --> 00:24:51.120 align:start position:0%
memory cards that hold all information
 
00:24:53.070 --> 00:24:53.080 align:start position:0%
from the ballot device should also be
 
00:24:56.029 --> 00:24:56.039 align:start position:0%
held until all contests are settled
 
00:24:58.750 --> 00:24:58.760 align:start position:0%
appeals have been expired and at least
 
00:25:01.389 --> 00:25:01.399 align:start position:0%
22 months after the election for federal
 
00:25:04.190 --> 00:25:04.200 align:start position:0%
and non-federal elections these devices
 
00:25:06.230 --> 00:25:06.240 align:start position:0%
are very important in our election
 
00:25:08.070 --> 00:25:08.080 align:start position:0%
process and should be preserved and
 
00:25:10.430 --> 00:25:10.440 align:start position:0%
treated as important as the ballots
 
00:25:13.190 --> 00:25:13.200 align:start position:0%
applications and lists thank you for
 
00:25:15.470 --> 00:25:15.480 align:start position:0%
considering considering and ought to
 
00:25:18.070 --> 00:25:18.080 align:start position:0%
pass so our voters can feel that the
 
00:25:20.029 --> 00:25:20.039 align:start position:0%
memory cards are safe and secure and
 
00:25:22.830 --> 00:25:22.840 align:start position:0%
available should an audit be necessary
 
00:25:25.830 --> 00:25:25.840 align:start position:0%
thank you questions from the committee
 
00:25:25.840 --> 00:25:26.950 align:start position:0%
thank you questions from the committee
represent

00:25:26.950 --> 00:25:26.960 align:start position:0%
represent
 
00:25:29.630 --> 00:25:29.640 align:start position:0%
L same to be the question lady today
 
00:25:31.830 --> 00:25:31.840 align:start position:0%
thanks for taking my question
 
00:25:35.950 --> 00:25:35.960 align:start position:0%
um it's a very um I'm just a little
 
00:25:37.590 --> 00:25:37.600 align:start position:0%
confused because we talk about memory
 
00:25:40.470 --> 00:25:40.480 align:start position:0%
chips but then in the text of the bill
 
00:25:43.830 --> 00:25:43.840 align:start position:0%
it talks about memory cards and I am by
 
00:25:47.110 --> 00:25:47.120 align:start position:0%
no means a technological whiz but I'm
 
00:25:49.870 --> 00:25:49.880 align:start position:0%
just curious is memory cards are we
 
00:25:52.710 --> 00:25:52.720 align:start position:0%
confident that that's capturing like all
 
00:25:54.909 --> 00:25:54.919 align:start position:0%
the different Technologies and I'm
 
00:25:57.549 --> 00:25:57.559 align:start position:0%
thinking USBS I'm thinking is it on a
 
00:26:00.950 --> 00:26:00.960 align:start position:0%
hard drive so that's my question very
 
00:26:03.750 --> 00:26:03.760 align:start position:0%
good question thank you um so it is the
 
00:26:06.669 --> 00:26:06.679 align:start position:0%
card that actually is inserted in the
 
00:26:09.750 --> 00:26:09.760 align:start position:0%
machine the title put chips I'm not sure
 
00:26:12.029 --> 00:26:12.039 align:start position:0%
why but it is referring to the memory
 
00:26:15.070 --> 00:26:15.080 align:start position:0%
cards and that's what I related to in my
 
00:26:16.950 --> 00:26:16.960 align:start position:0%
my testimony where I should have had
 
00:26:19.149 --> 00:26:19.159 align:start position:0%
cards instead it's just the little
 
00:26:20.990 --> 00:26:21.000 align:start position:0%
device that goes in versus going
 
00:26:23.430 --> 00:26:23.440 align:start position:0%
straight back to the um Secretary of
 
00:26:26.350 --> 00:26:26.360 align:start position:0%
State's office after elections or to
 
00:26:27.750 --> 00:26:27.760 align:start position:0%
whoever it goes to I don't know if it's
 
00:26:30.470 --> 00:26:30.480 align:start position:0%
to the SEC AR of state or if it's to
 
00:26:36.870 --> 00:26:36.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:39.110 --> 00:26:39.120 align:start position:0%
vendor further questions on the
 
00:26:41.830 --> 00:26:41.840 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none thank you um next
 
00:26:43.070 --> 00:26:43.080 align:start position:0%
up is deputy secretary of state Aaron

00:26:53.870 --> 00:26:53.880 align:start position:0%
clerk thank you Mr chair members of the
 
00:26:55.669 --> 00:26:55.679 align:start position:0%
committee Aon Hennessy deputy secretary
 
00:26:58.909 --> 00:26:58.919 align:start position:0%
of state um thank you representative you
 
00:27:01.230 --> 00:27:01.240 align:start position:0%
have my question I just want to clarify
 
00:27:03.750 --> 00:27:03.760 align:start position:0%
that this would be based on the
 
00:27:05.310 --> 00:27:05.320 align:start position:0%
sponsor's testimony that this would
 
00:27:08.710 --> 00:27:08.720 align:start position:0%
refer to the external memory sticks or
 
00:27:11.389 --> 00:27:11.399 align:start position:0%
external memory drives or whatever um
 
00:27:13.389 --> 00:27:13.399 align:start position:0%
language you want to call it and not an
 
00:27:16.909 --> 00:27:16.919 align:start position:0%
internal um piece of equipment that goes
 
00:27:20.510 --> 00:27:20.520 align:start position:0%
into a um electronic balla County device
 
00:27:24.590 --> 00:27:24.600 align:start position:0%
um currently the uh voting Works device
 
00:27:27.190 --> 00:27:27.200 align:start position:0%
after an election we do train all
 
00:27:29.750 --> 00:27:29.760 align:start position:0%
election officials to securely store
 
00:27:32.510 --> 00:27:32.520 align:start position:0%
these devices with their ballots so they
 
00:27:37.990 --> 00:27:38.000 align:start position:0%
are maintained um the um New Image cast
 
00:27:41.029 --> 00:27:41.039 align:start position:0%
uh will be used in one maybe two March
 
00:27:42.590 --> 00:27:42.600 align:start position:0%
Town elections that has been
 
00:27:44.070 --> 00:27:44.080 align:start position:0%
conditionally approved by the ballot law
 
00:27:46.509 --> 00:27:46.519 align:start position:0%
commission and we will be also training
 
00:27:48.950 --> 00:27:48.960 align:start position:0%
these towns to store these as well I
 
00:27:52.590 --> 00:27:52.600 align:start position:0%
would ask for an exemption from this um
 
00:27:56.269 --> 00:27:56.279 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure when the acote devices will
 
00:27:57.870 --> 00:27:57.880 align:start position:0%
go out of use in the state of New
 
00:27:57.880 --> 00:27:59.190 align:start position:0%
go out of use in the state of New
Hampshire

00:27:59.190 --> 00:27:59.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
00:28:01.830 --> 00:28:01.840 align:start position:0%
but as the um sponsor
 
00:28:06.029 --> 00:28:06.039 align:start position:0%
noted these are um I'm not quite sure
 
00:28:08.029 --> 00:28:08.039 align:start position:0%
what exactly the industry would call the
 
00:28:10.070 --> 00:28:10.080 align:start position:0%
cards the memory cards that are used for
 
00:28:13.389 --> 00:28:13.399 align:start position:0%
these devices but they are recycled um
 
00:28:16.029 --> 00:28:16.039 align:start position:0%
and reused for each election and so they
 
00:28:17.710 --> 00:28:17.720 align:start position:0%
have to go back to the vendor to be
 
00:28:20.750 --> 00:28:20.760 align:start position:0%
reprogrammed for another election and
 
00:28:22.630 --> 00:28:22.640 align:start position:0%
unfortunately because the device is so
 
00:28:25.230 --> 00:28:25.240 align:start position:0%
old and with the lack of supply for
 
00:28:29.350 --> 00:28:29.360 align:start position:0%
these um if we were to store them with
 
00:28:31.230 --> 00:28:31.240 align:start position:0%
the ballots they would not be able to be
 
00:28:33.230 --> 00:28:33.240 align:start position:0%
programmed for a future election and
 
00:28:37.269 --> 00:28:37.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:39.029 --> 00:28:39.039 align:start position:0%
issues will you be taking questions
 
00:28:41.509 --> 00:28:41.519 align:start position:0%
repes uh representative deputy secretary
 
00:28:42.870 --> 00:28:42.880 align:start position:0%
Hennessy my apologies will you be taking
 
00:28:45.990 --> 00:28:46.000 align:start position:0%
questions yes um representative mad
 
00:28:48.950 --> 00:28:48.960 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you
 
00:28:52.149 --> 00:28:52.159 align:start position:0%
um would the right takeaway be that that
 
00:28:54.590 --> 00:28:54.600 align:start position:0%
we that with respect to the new machines
 
00:28:57.190 --> 00:28:57.200 align:start position:0%
did you call them image cast there two
 
00:28:58.789 --> 00:28:58.799 align:start position:0%
voting works
 
00:29:00.750 --> 00:29:00.760 align:start position:0%
yeah okay with the respect to the new
 
00:29:00.760 --> 00:29:02.230 align:start position:0%
yeah okay with the respect to the new
machines

00:29:02.230 --> 00:29:02.240 align:start position:0%
machines
 
00:29:05.509 --> 00:29:05.519 align:start position:0%
um that this bill would just codify what
 
00:29:07.630 --> 00:29:07.640 align:start position:0%
we already do would that be the a fair
 
00:29:10.310 --> 00:29:10.320 align:start position:0%
interpretation that's correct yep
 
00:29:12.190 --> 00:29:12.200 align:start position:0%
further question from the committee
 
00:29:14.350 --> 00:29:14.360 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you last up is Alber

andano from Kensington um representative
 
00:29:20.190 --> 00:29:20.200 align:start position:0%
gusowski if you grab that uh sheet for
 
00:29:25.990 --> 00:29:26.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:38.830 --> 00:29:38.840 align:start position:0%

andano I'm from Kensington New Hampshire
 
00:29:45.830 --> 00:29:45.840 align:start position:0%
um the most important part of this bill
 
00:29:48.990 --> 00:29:49.000 align:start position:0%
is the strict chain of custody um if you
 
00:29:53.230 --> 00:29:53.240 align:start position:0%
look at Hava the America uh to build
 
00:29:55.310 --> 00:29:55.320 align:start position:0%
trust in our elections we have to have
 
00:29:58.029 --> 00:29:58.039 align:start position:0%
an accurate compliant securable and
 
00:29:58.039 --> 00:29:59.470 align:start position:0%
an accurate compliant securable and
auditable

election what you heard from the
 
00:30:04.630 --> 00:30:04.640 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State's um assistant is
 
00:30:08.190 --> 00:30:08.200 align:start position:0%
incorrect because you are violating
 
00:30:10.909 --> 00:30:10.919 align:start position:0%
currently violating federal law and the
 
00:30:13.630 --> 00:30:13.640 align:start position:0%
state has been noticed of this I will
 
00:30:16.789 --> 00:30:16.799 align:start position:0%
point out uh the app appal Constitution
 
00:30:19.350 --> 00:30:19.360 align:start position:0%
and statutory provisions and I'll leave
 
00:30:24.230 --> 00:30:24.240 align:start position:0%

records are supposed to be held for 22
 
00:31:05.629 --> 00:31:05.639 align:start position:0%
months and we're in violation we're in
 
00:31:07.990 --> 00:31:08.000 align:start position:0%
violation because we may we have a

contractor who has a problem with memory
 
00:31:13.110 --> 00:31:13.120 align:start position:0%
cards that's not this body's qu that's

00:31:40.789 --> 00:31:40.799 align:start position:0%
have any other pink cards um there was
 
00:31:42.190 --> 00:31:42.200 align:start position:0%
no one signed up on the blue sheet
 
00:31:44.629 --> 00:31:44.639 align:start position:0%
online there was 24 in support and 94
 
00:31:46.990 --> 00:31:47.000 align:start position:0%
posed but I wouldn't read into that
 
00:31:49.629 --> 00:31:49.639 align:start position:0%
because one of them says Be Kind to all

God's creatures and two of them talk
 
00:31:55.629 --> 00:31:55.639 align:start position:0%
about floride so I don't think uh I
 
00:31:57.430 --> 00:31:57.440 align:start position:0%
think I think there may have been some
 
00:31:59.990 --> 00:32:00.000 align:start position:0%
confusion with people giving testimony
 
00:32:02.549 --> 00:32:02.559 align:start position:0%

00:32:02.559 --> 00:32:03.430 align:start position:0%
um so do your best do your best with
those

00:32:03.430 --> 00:32:03.440 align:start position:0%
those
 
00:32:06.789 --> 00:32:06.799 align:start position:0%

00:38:36.790 --> 00:38:36.800 align:start position:0%
intention of messing with it those
 
00:38:38.750 --> 00:38:38.760 align:start position:0%
people exist they shouldn't be doing
 
00:38:40.550 --> 00:38:40.560 align:start position:0%
what they're doing um I would hope we
 
00:38:41.710 --> 00:38:41.720 align:start position:0%
would all agree with that that you
 
00:38:43.309 --> 00:38:43.319 align:start position:0%
should be voting in the primary that you
 
00:38:47.230 --> 00:38:47.240 align:start position:0%
most align with um however um because
 
00:38:48.750 --> 00:38:48.760 align:start position:0%
those Bad actors do those things it
 
00:38:50.829 --> 00:38:50.839 align:start position:0%
breeds this idea that we should shut out
 
00:38:53.510 --> 00:38:53.520 align:start position:0%
all Undeclared voters so I actually did
 
00:38:54.710 --> 00:38:54.720 align:start position:0%
something that no one has done before
 
00:38:56.550 --> 00:38:56.560 align:start position:0%
which actually went into the numbers and
 
00:38:58.470 --> 00:38:58.480 align:start position:0%
see how how many of these Bad actors
 
00:39:02.230 --> 00:39:02.240 align:start position:0%
could we readily identify so in the the
 
00:39:03.910 --> 00:39:03.920 align:start position:0%
most coordinated effort we've seen for
 
00:39:05.589 --> 00:39:05.599 align:start position:0%
quote unquote Bad actors in a primary
 
00:39:08.230 --> 00:39:08.240 align:start position:0%
was actually in the latest 2024
 
00:39:11.069 --> 00:39:11.079 align:start position:0%
presidential primary where supporters of
 
00:39:13.390 --> 00:39:13.400 align:start position:0%
one of the presidential campaigns uh
 
00:39:15.150 --> 00:39:15.160 align:start position:0%
actively went out and recruited left
 
00:39:16.750 --> 00:39:16.760 align:start position:0%
leaning Undeclared voters to vote in the
 
00:39:18.589 --> 00:39:18.599 align:start position:0%
Republican primary they actively did
 
00:39:20.190 --> 00:39:20.200 align:start position:0%
that there's no doubt about it I have
 
00:39:22.670 --> 00:39:22.680 align:start position:0%
the receipts they were they they were
 
00:39:25.990 --> 00:39:26.000 align:start position:0%
doing it they were doing it so what I
 
00:39:27.750 --> 00:39:27.760 align:start position:0%
did was I said okay how many those
 
00:39:29.829 --> 00:39:29.839 align:start position:0%
people how many of those Undeclared
 
00:39:31.550 --> 00:39:31.560 align:start position:0%
voters voted in the Republican
 
00:39:32.950 --> 00:39:32.960 align:start position:0%
presidential primary and then came and
 
00:39:34.750 --> 00:39:34.760 align:start position:0%
voted in the Democrat State primary so
 
00:39:37.710 --> 00:39:37.720 align:start position:0%
same year both sides right and I I
 
00:39:40.069 --> 00:39:40.079 align:start position:0%
assume it's not a true assumption but I
 
00:39:41.390 --> 00:39:41.400 align:start position:0%
assume that they're all Bad actors
 
00:39:43.190 --> 00:39:43.200 align:start position:0%
they're probably not but just for the
 
00:39:45.630 --> 00:39:45.640 align:start position:0%
sake of this let's assume that they are
 
00:39:48.030 --> 00:39:48.040 align:start position:0%
so if they if you assume all of those
 
00:39:58.270 --> 00:39:58.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:59.870 --> 00:39:59.880 align:start position:0%
out of those people
 
00:40:03.470 --> 00:40:03.480 align:start position:0%
23,000 uh 95 voted in the Republican
 
00:40:04.950 --> 00:40:04.960 align:start position:0%
presidential primary and then voted in
 
00:40:07.870 --> 00:40:07.880 align:start position:0%
the Democrat State primary or 7.3% of
 
00:40:11.150 --> 00:40:11.160 align:start position:0%
the overall vote so 7.3% of the overall
 
00:40:13.230 --> 00:40:13.240 align:start position:0%
vote in the Republican primary came from
 
00:40:15.589 --> 00:40:15.599 align:start position:0%
people that could be labeled Bad actors
 
00:40:20.230 --> 00:40:20.240 align:start position:0%
which means 92 93% were probably voting
 
00:40:21.550 --> 00:40:21.560 align:start position:0%
with who they aligned with and that's
 
00:40:22.910 --> 00:40:22.920 align:start position:0%
assuming that all those people are Bad
 
00:40:24.670 --> 00:40:24.680 align:start position:0%
actors which is not a fair assumption
 
00:40:27.910 --> 00:40:27.920 align:start position:0%
but I'm just going to do it anyways um
 
00:40:29.270 --> 00:40:29.280 align:start position:0%
if you further dive down in the numbers
 
00:40:30.390 --> 00:40:30.400 align:start position:0%
you say all right how many of those were
 
00:40:31.550 --> 00:40:31.560 align:start position:0%
just Undeclared so how many of the
 
00:40:33.670 --> 00:40:33.680 align:start position:0%
Undeclared are Bad actors in that
 
00:40:36.710 --> 00:40:36.720 align:start position:0%
situation so there were
 
00:40:39.030 --> 00:40:39.040 align:start position:0%
13654 Undeclared voters in the
 
00:40:42.069 --> 00:40:42.079 align:start position:0%
Republican 2024 presidential primary so
 
00:40:45.510 --> 00:40:45.520 align:start position:0%
of that as I said the 23,095 um that
 
00:40:49.230 --> 00:40:49.240 align:start position:0%
would make them 17 16.9 91% or let's
 
00:40:52.270 --> 00:40:52.280 align:start position:0%
call it 177% of the Undeclared voters in
 
00:40:54.069 --> 00:40:54.079 align:start position:0%
the most
 
00:40:56.030 --> 00:40:56.040 align:start position:0%
coordinated I don't want to say attack
 
00:40:57.910 --> 00:40:57.920 align:start position:0%
but let's say the most coordinated
 
00:41:01.829 --> 00:41:01.839 align:start position:0%
effort to undermine a Party primary um
 
00:41:05.790 --> 00:41:05.800 align:start position:0%
so for us to eject all all Undeclared
 
00:41:07.990 --> 00:41:08.000 align:start position:0%
voters from our primary would be
 
00:41:12.589 --> 00:41:12.599 align:start position:0%
ejecting 80% to go after potentially 20%
 
00:41:14.550 --> 00:41:14.560 align:start position:0%
so you lose four good voters to try to
 
00:41:17.230 --> 00:41:17.240 align:start position:0%
get one to try to get one bad voter it's
 
00:41:21.030 --> 00:41:21.040 align:start position:0%
just bad math um so when you see these
 
00:41:23.030 --> 00:41:23.040 align:start position:0%
things you know people shouldn't be bad
 
00:41:25.109 --> 00:41:25.119 align:start position:0%
actors they are there are Bad actors
 
00:41:26.430 --> 00:41:26.440 align:start position:0%
they shouldn't be doing it because it
 
00:41:28.829 --> 00:41:28.839 align:start position:0%
leads to legislation like this but the
 
00:41:30.390 --> 00:41:30.400 align:start position:0%
fact of the matter is even the most
 
00:41:34.190 --> 00:41:34.200 align:start position:0%
coordinated attack was really only 7.3%
 
00:41:36.950 --> 00:41:36.960 align:start position:0%
of the vote so you know there's the
 
00:41:39.109 --> 00:41:39.119 align:start position:0%
philosophical reasons to oppose this um
 
00:41:41.349 --> 00:41:41.359 align:start position:0%
the one for me is that um you shouldn't
 
00:41:43.190 --> 00:41:43.200 align:start position:0%
be asking the taxpayers to fund an
 
00:41:45.069 --> 00:41:45.079 align:start position:0%
election that they can't participate in
 
00:41:46.630 --> 00:41:46.640 align:start position:0%
um so that's my philosophical objection
 
00:41:48.270 --> 00:41:48.280 align:start position:0%
to it but if you actually want to go
 
00:41:50.990 --> 00:41:51.000 align:start position:0%
into what impact are the Bad actors
 
00:41:54.790 --> 00:41:54.800 align:start position:0%
having um it's arguably minimal and I
 
00:41:57.230 --> 00:41:57.240 align:start position:0%
would say that in the most coordinated
 
00:41:58.950 --> 00:41:58.960 align:start position:0%
well funded attack ever Donald Trump
 
00:42:01.670 --> 00:42:01.680 align:start position:0%
still won the Primary so even when they
 
00:42:03.270 --> 00:42:03.280 align:start position:0%
tried really really hard and they had
 
00:42:04.750 --> 00:42:04.760 align:start position:0%
nothing on the other side to draw them
 
00:42:07.109 --> 00:42:07.119 align:start position:0%
over they still failed so let's not
 
00:42:09.990 --> 00:42:10.000 align:start position:0%
eject 80% of Voters of Undeclared voters
 
00:42:12.190 --> 00:42:12.200 align:start position:0%
to go after the 20% it's bad it's bad
 
00:42:14.550 --> 00:42:14.560 align:start position:0%
math um and I'm glad that we're going
 
00:42:15.670 --> 00:42:15.680 align:start position:0%
probably going to universally iil this
 
00:42:16.990 --> 00:42:17.000 align:start position:0%
but anyways I'm sorry to derail the
 
00:42:18.230 --> 00:42:18.240 align:start position:0%
executive session but I felt those
 
00:42:20.349 --> 00:42:20.359 align:start position:0%
numbers needed to be said um and I felt
 
00:42:21.589 --> 00:42:21.599 align:start position:0%
that that needed to be said out loud and
 
00:42:23.190 --> 00:42:23.200 align:start position:0%
I'm willing to take the heat for it so
 
00:42:25.710 --> 00:42:25.720 align:start position:0%
with that does anyone else wish to aine
 
00:42:26.750 --> 00:42:26.760 align:start position:0%
are you ready for the question of the
 
00:42:28.910 --> 00:42:28.920 align:start position:0%
motion of expedient to legislate on
 
00:42:30.309 --> 00:42:30.319 align:start position:0%

placed on consent calendar hearing none
 
00:43:17.150 --> 00:43:17.160 align:start position:0%
the bill will be placed on consent

calendar I will be responsible for the
 
00:43:19.670 --> 00:43:19.680 align:start position:0%
report in which you'll see a lot of
 
00:43:21.670 --> 00:43:21.680 align:start position:0%
those same numbers again with that I
 
00:43:23.069 --> 00:43:23.079 align:start position:0%
will close the executive session for
 
00:43:25.190 --> 00:43:25.200 align:start position:0%
House Bill 172 and we are going to go
 
00:43:26.630 --> 00:43:26.640 align:start position:0%
back into a stance of public hearing so
 
00:43:28.109 --> 00:43:28.119 align:start position:0%
we're going to open open up the public
 
00:43:30.990 --> 00:43:31.000 align:start position:0%
hearing for House Bill
 
00:43:34.030 --> 00:43:34.040 align:start position:0%
341 FN requiring the Secretary of State
 
00:43:35.910 --> 00:43:35.920 align:start position:0%
to check voter records prior to every
 
00:43:37.549 --> 00:43:37.559 align:start position:0%
election and we are going to recognize
 
00:43:39.349 --> 00:43:39.359 align:start position:0%
our own representative Ward for the
 
00:43:55.870 --> 00:43:55.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:57.589 --> 00:43:57.599 align:start position:0%
introduction thank thank you chairman
 
00:43:59.270 --> 00:43:59.280 align:start position:0%
Barry I appreciate that nice to see you
 
00:44:00.910 --> 00:44:00.920 align:start position:0%
all out here from a different
 
00:44:03.230 --> 00:44:03.240 align:start position:0%
perspective uh my name is Jerry Ward and
 
00:44:05.950 --> 00:44:05.960 align:start position:0%
I represent excuse me Rockingham 27
 
00:44:08.990 --> 00:44:09.000 align:start position:0%
which is Ward 4 in Portsmouth and as I
 
00:44:11.870 --> 00:44:11.880 align:start position:0%
get going I should note that the tagline
 
00:44:14.069 --> 00:44:14.079 align:start position:0%
analysis for this bill is not exactly
 
00:44:17.870 --> 00:44:17.880 align:start position:0%
what the bill is about which we've seen
 
00:44:17.880 --> 00:44:18.910 align:start position:0%
what the bill is about which we've seen
on

00:44:18.910 --> 00:44:18.920 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:44:21.270 --> 00:44:21.280 align:start position:0%
occasion uh I was asked to bring forward
 
00:44:25.670 --> 00:44:25.680 align:start position:0%
this bill HB 341 FN by the six member
 
00:44:27.309 --> 00:44:27.319 align:start position:0%
Board of registrars of the city of
 
00:44:29.270 --> 00:44:29.280 align:start position:0%
Portsmith to make a small change to the
 
00:44:31.710 --> 00:44:31.720 align:start position:0%
law that will improve their work and
 
00:44:34.470 --> 00:44:34.480 align:start position:0%
make our voter lists more accurate while
 
00:44:36.990 --> 00:44:37.000 align:start position:0%
respecting the rights of Voters in the
 
00:44:38.950 --> 00:44:38.960 align:start position:0%
interest of full disclosure as some of
 
00:44:40.950 --> 00:44:40.960 align:start position:0%
you know my wife Barbara is the registar
 
00:44:42.870 --> 00:44:42.880 align:start position:0%
at large and supervisor of the checklist
 
00:44:45.150 --> 00:44:45.160 align:start position:0%
in Portsmouth but this bill has the
 
00:44:47.430 --> 00:44:47.440 align:start position:0%
support of her entire board and I
 
00:44:50.030 --> 00:44:50.040 align:start position:0%
suspect of registrars in other cities as
 
00:44:52.390 --> 00:44:52.400 align:start position:0%
well who experienced the same issue in
 
00:44:56.109 --> 00:44:56.119 align:start position:0%
2024 that prompted this dare I say
 
00:44:58.910 --> 00:44:58.920 align:start position:0%
simple bill
 
00:45:00.549 --> 00:45:00.559 align:start position:0%
this bill is designed to guarantee a
 
00:45:03.829 --> 00:45:03.839 align:start position:0%
reasonable time at least 90 days for
 
00:45:05.990 --> 00:45:06.000 align:start position:0%
supervisors of the checklist registar of
 
00:45:08.589 --> 00:45:08.599 align:start position:0%
Voters and City Clerks to complete the
 
00:45:10.230 --> 00:45:10.240 align:start position:0%
process of removing voters from the
 
00:45:12.190 --> 00:45:12.200 align:start position:0%
checklist based on the national change
 
00:45:13.710 --> 00:45:13.720 align:start position:0%
of address
 
00:45:16.309 --> 00:45:16.319 align:start position:0%
NCA list provided by the United States
 
00:45:18.510 --> 00:45:18.520 align:start position:0%
Postal Service through the good offices
 
00:45:20.829 --> 00:45:20.839 align:start position:0%
of the Secretary of State moving the
 
00:45:22.630 --> 00:45:22.640 align:start position:0%
date of receipt to at least 90 days
 
00:45:24.910 --> 00:45:24.920 align:start position:0%
prior to any election will ensure that
 
00:45:26.589 --> 00:45:26.599 align:start position:0%
it will be received well before any
 
00:45:28.829 --> 00:45:28.839 align:start position:0%
deadline for verification of the
 
00:45:30.990 --> 00:45:31.000 align:start position:0%
checklists excuse me and prior to the
 
00:45:33.309 --> 00:45:33.319 align:start position:0%
deadline for submitting absentee ballot
 
00:45:36.750 --> 00:45:36.760 align:start position:0%
requests and so on in 2024 the
 
00:45:38.790 --> 00:45:38.800 align:start position:0%
registrars in psmith and elsewhere were
 
00:45:41.030 --> 00:45:41.040 align:start position:0%
caught short uh when they received the
 
00:45:44.549 --> 00:45:44.559 align:start position:0%
ncoa list for review only on August 28th
 
00:45:46.230 --> 00:45:46.240 align:start position:0%
just before the Labor Day weekend and
 
00:45:49.190 --> 00:45:49.200 align:start position:0%
only 13 days before the state primary at
 
00:45:50.950 --> 00:45:50.960 align:start position:0%
a time when they were still processing
 
00:45:53.230 --> 00:45:53.240 align:start position:0%
hundreds of voter registrations and some
 
00:45:54.990 --> 00:45:55.000 align:start position:0%
absentee ballots had already been
 
00:45:58.030 --> 00:45:58.040 align:start position:0%
returned getting the NCA letter at such
 
00:46:00.829 --> 00:46:00.839 align:start position:0%
a late date for whatever reason uh with
 
00:46:04.230 --> 00:46:04.240 align:start position:0%
a thousand names on it or so created an
 
00:46:05.630 --> 00:46:05.640 align:start position:0%
unfortunate situation that was
 
00:46:07.430 --> 00:46:07.440 align:start position:0%
detrimental to their work and to the
 
00:46:10.549 --> 00:46:10.559 align:start position:0%
rights of some voters it is possible for
 
00:46:12.950 --> 00:46:12.960 align:start position:0%
the registrars to receive the NCA list
 
00:46:14.510 --> 00:46:14.520 align:start position:0%
from the Secretary of State's office in
 
00:46:17.829 --> 00:46:17.839 align:start position:0%
a more timely fashion in 2023 for
 
00:46:20.030 --> 00:46:20.040 align:start position:0%
example they received the lists on June
 
00:46:22.030 --> 00:46:22.040 align:start position:0%
30th in a year when there were only
 
00:46:24.349 --> 00:46:24.359 align:start position:0%
Municipal elections uh and thus had
 
00:46:26.069 --> 00:46:26.079 align:start position:0%
about four months to review the lists
 
00:46:28.829 --> 00:46:28.839 align:start position:0%
and notify votes voters an ample time to
 
00:46:30.710 --> 00:46:30.720 align:start position:0%
contact any voters who they belied
 
00:46:32.270 --> 00:46:32.280 align:start position:0%
should not be removed without going
 
00:46:35.309 --> 00:46:35.319 align:start position:0%
through the 30-day letter process the
 
00:46:35.319 --> 00:46:36.710 align:start position:0%
through the 30-day letter process the
NCA

00:46:36.710 --> 00:46:36.720 align:start position:0%
NCA
 
00:46:39.109 --> 00:46:39.119 align:start position:0%
lists uh include people who've simply
 
00:46:41.150 --> 00:46:41.160 align:start position:0%
changed their address to a post office
 
00:46:43.630 --> 00:46:43.640 align:start position:0%
box uh that is more convenient for them
 
00:46:45.270 --> 00:46:45.280 align:start position:0%
but who have not actually moved from the
 
00:46:46.950 --> 00:46:46.960 align:start position:0%
domicile address at which they are
 
00:46:49.549 --> 00:46:49.559 align:start position:0%
registered to vote uh who have temp or
 
00:46:51.150 --> 00:46:51.160 align:start position:0%
who have temporarily changed their
 
00:46:53.549 --> 00:46:53.559 align:start position:0%
address because of seasonal moves and
 
00:46:55.910 --> 00:46:55.920 align:start position:0%
the NCA lists also include some people
 
00:46:58.950 --> 00:46:58.960 align:start position:0%
who are OV voters evaluating such
 
00:47:01.309 --> 00:47:01.319 align:start position:0%
changes and address carefully takes time
 
00:47:04.150 --> 00:47:04.160 align:start position:0%
and requires some caution I think we all
 
00:47:06.430 --> 00:47:06.440 align:start position:0%
recognize that the NCA lists are a very
 
00:47:09.470 --> 00:47:09.480 align:start position:0%
valuable tool but Al although they're
 
00:47:11.510 --> 00:47:11.520 align:start position:0%
mostly accurate like everything they are
 
00:47:14.109 --> 00:47:14.119 align:start position:0%
not necessarily completely so and each
 
00:47:16.309 --> 00:47:16.319 align:start position:0%
voter's circumstances need to be
 
00:47:16.319 --> 00:47:17.630 align:start position:0%
voter's circumstances need to be
evaluated

00:47:17.630 --> 00:47:17.640 align:start position:0%
evaluated
 
00:47:19.470 --> 00:47:19.480 align:start position:0%
individually so I believe that this
 
00:47:22.510 --> 00:47:22.520 align:start position:0%
small change to the pertinent RSA 654
 
00:47:25.630 --> 00:47:25.640 align:start position:0%
col 45 would provide ample time for
 
00:47:27.870 --> 00:47:27.880 align:start position:0%
proper review of NC away lists by our
 
00:47:30.710 --> 00:47:30.720 align:start position:0%
supervisors and registrars primary uh
 
00:47:33.069 --> 00:47:33.079 align:start position:0%
prior to primary General Municipal and
 
00:47:36.150 --> 00:47:36.160 align:start position:0%
town elections I don't believe it should
 
00:47:37.829 --> 00:47:37.839 align:start position:0%
cause the Secretary of State's office
 
00:47:40.589 --> 00:47:40.599 align:start position:0%
any undue issues uh and it will enhance
 
00:47:42.309 --> 00:47:42.319 align:start position:0%
the maintenance and accuracy of voter
 
00:47:44.950 --> 00:47:44.960 align:start position:0%
list that we all want while respecting
 
00:47:47.549 --> 00:47:47.559 align:start position:0%
the rights of all voters thank
 
00:47:50.870 --> 00:47:50.880 align:start position:0%
you will you taking questions anybody
 
00:47:54.030 --> 00:47:54.040 align:start position:0%
else signed up uh deputy secretary is
 
00:47:56.670 --> 00:47:56.680 align:start position:0%
why not let her answer you probably well
 
00:47:58.150 --> 00:47:58.160 align:start position:0%
GL did yes I was going to say if you
 
00:47:59.630 --> 00:47:59.640 align:start position:0%
don't take questions your ranking member
 
00:48:01.829 --> 00:48:01.839 align:start position:0%
is going to want to talk to you cuz I
 
00:48:05.710 --> 00:48:05.720 align:start position:0%
was talked to representative weie uh
 
00:48:07.589 --> 00:48:07.599 align:start position:0%
assuming that time machines have not
 
00:48:09.030 --> 00:48:09.040 align:start position:0%
been invented yet would you want to
 
00:48:11.710 --> 00:48:11.720 align:start position:0%
change the date on line three from July
 
00:48:15.069 --> 00:48:15.079 align:start position:0%
1st 2022 to maybe
 
00:48:18.589 --> 00:48:18.599 align:start position:0%
202 five or 2026 or something like that
 
00:48:21.150 --> 00:48:21.160 align:start position:0%
you may not make it exp poost
 
00:48:25.349 --> 00:48:25.359 align:start position:0%
facto yeah perhaps good idea using fancy
 
00:48:27.510 --> 00:48:27.520 align:start position:0%
Latin language on me right there's thank
 
00:48:28.710 --> 00:48:28.720 align:start position:0%
you for the question and there's some
 
00:48:31.549 --> 00:48:31.559 align:start position:0%
good uh there's a some other language
 
00:48:34.910 --> 00:48:34.920 align:start position:0%
changes we might put in there too uh
 
00:48:37.990 --> 00:48:38.000 align:start position:0%
online but I you no that's a good point
 
00:48:39.390 --> 00:48:39.400 align:start position:0%
and yeah do a followup representative
 
00:48:42.910 --> 00:48:42.920 align:start position:0%
wearing thank you Mr chair and I
 
00:48:46.349 --> 00:48:46.359 align:start position:0%
just uh you you mentioned that
 
00:48:50.470 --> 00:48:50.480 align:start position:0%
um I think doing this um annually in
 
00:48:52.589 --> 00:48:52.599 align:start position:0%
this manner will
 
00:48:56.390 --> 00:48:56.400 align:start position:0%
also make ultimately the work easier for
 
00:48:56.400 --> 00:48:57.549 align:start position:0%
also make ultimately the work easier for
those

00:48:57.549 --> 00:48:57.559 align:start position:0%
those
 
00:49:00.030 --> 00:49:00.040 align:start position:0%
uh supervisors of the checklist is that
 
00:49:03.349 --> 00:49:03.359 align:start position:0%
the general consensus yes sir thank you
 
00:49:04.349 --> 00:49:04.359 align:start position:0%
further questions on the committee
 
00:49:04.359 --> 00:49:05.670 align:start position:0%
further questions on the committee
representative

00:49:05.670 --> 00:49:05.680 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:49:07.990 --> 00:49:08.000 align:start position:0%
C thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
00:49:11.470 --> 00:49:11.480 align:start position:0%
taking my question um this is annually
 
00:49:14.750 --> 00:49:14.760 align:start position:0%
is uh is that implying it's done once a
 
00:49:16.390 --> 00:49:16.400 align:start position:0%
year because we have elections that are
 
00:49:18.910 --> 00:49:18.920 align:start position:0%
more than 90 days
 
00:49:21.349 --> 00:49:21.359 align:start position:0%
apart I think it's thank you for the
 
00:49:22.750 --> 00:49:22.760 align:start position:0%
question good question I think it means
 
00:49:26.870 --> 00:49:26.880 align:start position:0%
90 days before any election
 
00:49:28.950 --> 00:49:28.960 align:start position:0%
would you like a followup or SC followup
 
00:49:33.150 --> 00:49:33.160 align:start position:0%
okay uh okay so it's it's for any
 
00:49:36.430 --> 00:49:36.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:39.510 --> 00:49:39.520 align:start position:0%
annually maybe the word annually is not
 
00:49:43.069 --> 00:49:43.079 align:start position:0%
the best word then thank you sounds like
 
00:49:45.910 --> 00:49:45.920 align:start position:0%
we need some amending to what could be a
 
00:49:49.910 --> 00:49:49.920 align:start position:0%
bipartisan bill could be we'll see
 
00:49:52.349 --> 00:49:52.359 align:start position:0%
represent represented in your head sorry
 
00:49:54.150 --> 00:49:54.160 align:start position:0%
Qui question on the previous question
 
00:49:56.150 --> 00:49:56.160 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I me as I understood
 
00:49:58.230 --> 00:49:58.240 align:start position:0%
the word and I'd like to ask the sponsor
 
00:50:00.510 --> 00:50:00.520 align:start position:0%
whether this is a correct understanding
 
00:50:02.390 --> 00:50:02.400 align:start position:0%
um this would
 
00:50:06.230 --> 00:50:06.240 align:start position:0%
happen annually I.E once a year and as a
 
00:50:08.750 --> 00:50:08.760 align:start position:0%
further condition on that annual
 
00:50:12.109 --> 00:50:12.119 align:start position:0%
process it could happen no later than 90
 
00:50:13.549 --> 00:50:13.559 align:start position:0%
days before any
 
00:50:16.069 --> 00:50:16.079 align:start position:0%
election so there are two conditions on
 
00:50:17.750 --> 00:50:17.760 align:start position:0%
when it happens it must happen at least
 
00:50:20.230 --> 00:50:20.240 align:start position:0%
once a year and no later than 90 days
 
00:50:22.390 --> 00:50:22.400 align:start position:0%
before an election is is that the
 
00:50:25.430 --> 00:50:25.440 align:start position:0%
correct way of understanding
 
00:50:28.430 --> 00:50:28.440 align:start position:0%
the I thanks for the question I think so
 
00:50:29.950 --> 00:50:29.960 align:start position:0%
I don't think
 
00:50:31.990 --> 00:50:32.000 align:start position:0%
annually uh I would interpret that to
 
00:50:34.109 --> 00:50:34.119 align:start position:0%
mean at least annually come out more
 
00:50:34.119 --> 00:50:35.990 align:start position:0%
mean at least annually come out more
than

00:50:35.990 --> 00:50:36.000 align:start position:0%
than
 
00:50:38.069 --> 00:50:38.079 align:start position:0%
once was that the answer that you were
 
00:50:41.230 --> 00:50:41.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:41.240 --> 00:50:46.430 align:start position:0%
 
head

00:50:46.430 --> 00:50:46.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:48.630 --> 00:50:48.640 align:start position:0%
no represent I don't understand
 
00:50:50.349 --> 00:50:50.359 align:start position:0%
logically when something happens
 
00:50:52.630 --> 00:50:52.640 align:start position:0%
annually there's no logical reason why
 
00:50:55.950 --> 00:50:55.960 align:start position:0%
it couldn't happen more than once a year
 
00:50:58.349 --> 00:50:58.359 align:start position:0%
um but the the bill doesn't ask for it
 
00:51:01.309 --> 00:51:01.319 align:start position:0%
to happen before every election I wanted
 
00:51:03.430 --> 00:51:03.440 align:start position:0%
to clarify that it's only requiring it
 
00:51:05.950 --> 00:51:05.960 align:start position:0%
to happen once per
 
00:51:09.109 --> 00:51:09.119 align:start position:0%
year could I respond to that
 
00:51:10.789 --> 00:51:10.799 align:start position:0%
absolutely I don't know what you're
 
00:51:12.990 --> 00:51:13.000 align:start position:0%
responding to but go for
 
00:51:16.109 --> 00:51:16.119 align:start position:0%
it well I think in this in the second
 
00:51:18.470 --> 00:51:18.480 align:start position:0%
line it refers to every type of election
 
00:51:20.710 --> 00:51:20.720 align:start position:0%
does it
 
00:51:23.150 --> 00:51:23.160 align:start position:0%
not believe that's line
 
00:51:25.390 --> 00:51:25.400 align:start position:0%
four I don't have I don't have the lines
 
00:51:27.670 --> 00:51:27.680 align:start position:0%
on my thing
 
00:51:30.030 --> 00:51:30.040 align:start position:0%
sounds about
 
00:51:31.990 --> 00:51:32.000 align:start position:0%
right all right further questions from
 
00:51:33.950 --> 00:51:33.960 align:start position:0%
the committee representative Lane coming
 
00:51:38.390 --> 00:51:38.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:42.349 --> 00:51:42.359 align:start position:0%
you thank you uh I think some of the
 
00:51:45.549 --> 00:51:45.559 align:start position:0%
confusion is that the existing statute
 
00:51:48.069 --> 00:51:48.079 align:start position:0%
says no less than
 
00:51:50.910 --> 00:51:50.920 align:start position:0%
annually so I think part of that at
 
00:51:52.950 --> 00:51:52.960 align:start position:0%
least for me because I read it the same
 
00:51:55.349 --> 00:51:55.359 align:start position:0%
way representative mure had did that it
 
00:51:57.750 --> 00:51:57.760 align:start position:0%
we were going from
 
00:52:01.349 --> 00:52:01.359 align:start position:0%
that to one time per year and it had to
 
00:52:04.030 --> 00:52:04.040 align:start position:0%
be 90 days before an
 
00:52:06.630 --> 00:52:06.640 align:start position:0%
election I I I tell you what um let's
 
00:52:09.430 --> 00:52:09.440 align:start position:0%
get deputy secretary Hennessy up here
 
00:52:12.230 --> 00:52:12.240 align:start position:0%
let's finish our hearings on it and we
 
00:52:13.990 --> 00:52:14.000 align:start position:0%
can actually work on it in executive
 
00:52:16.109 --> 00:52:16.119 align:start position:0%
session today we won't noily vote on it
 
00:52:17.870 --> 00:52:17.880 align:start position:0%
we can actually work on it um because I
 
00:52:19.109 --> 00:52:19.119 align:start position:0%
think these questions probably would be
 
00:52:22.150 --> 00:52:22.160 align:start position:0%
more um appropriate for executive
 
00:52:25.510 --> 00:52:25.520 align:start position:0%
session yes representative Bo I just
 
00:52:28.109 --> 00:52:28.119 align:start position:0%
it's been pointed out to to me too that
 
00:52:31.190 --> 00:52:31.200 align:start position:0%
the last last sentence about all records
 
00:52:33.789 --> 00:52:33.799 align:start position:0%
identified as moving should be revised
 
00:52:37.470 --> 00:52:37.480 align:start position:0%
to be in English speak in English
 
00:52:39.630 --> 00:52:39.640 align:start position:0%
excellent it isn't the records that are
 
00:52:43.230 --> 00:52:43.240 align:start position:0%
moving it's the people fair enough um
 
00:52:44.750 --> 00:52:44.760 align:start position:0%
any other questions for representative
 
00:52:48.109 --> 00:52:48.119 align:start position:0%
Ward seeing none thank you um next up is
 
00:52:50.069 --> 00:52:50.079 align:start position:0%
or my only other pink card I think let
 
00:52:51.750 --> 00:52:51.760 align:start position:0%
me Jos verify that deputy secretary
 
00:52:53.309 --> 00:52:53.319 align:start position:0%
Hennessy so representative gasowski if
 
00:53:02.950 --> 00:53:02.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:04.829 --> 00:53:04.839 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair good morning again
 
00:53:06.670 --> 00:53:06.680 align:start position:0%
everyone Aon Hennessy deputy secretary
 
00:53:09.349 --> 00:53:09.359 align:start position:0%
of state I'm happy to answer questions
 
00:53:11.870 --> 00:53:11.880 align:start position:0%
but first I would like to give our
 
00:53:11.880 --> 00:53:13.510 align:start position:0%
but first I would like to give our
offices

00:53:13.510 --> 00:53:13.520 align:start position:0%
offices
 
00:53:16.589 --> 00:53:16.599 align:start position:0%
um uh desire for this legislation as you
 
00:53:18.750 --> 00:53:18.760 align:start position:0%
all know we got a new Statewide voter
 
00:53:21.750 --> 00:53:21.760 align:start position:0%
registration system last year when when
 
00:53:23.270 --> 00:53:23.280 align:start position:0%
we do an
 
00:53:27.109 --> 00:53:27.119 align:start position:0%
NCA um notification to Super ADV visors
 
00:53:31.190 --> 00:53:31.200 align:start position:0%
it's not a um an easy process we have a
 
00:53:33.549 --> 00:53:33.559 align:start position:0%
vendor that we contract with we have to
 
00:53:36.789 --> 00:53:36.799 align:start position:0%
get all of the addresses names and
 
00:53:39.829 --> 00:53:39.839 align:start position:0%
addresses in the entire Statewide voter
 
00:53:42.670 --> 00:53:42.680 align:start position:0%
registration um system bumped up against
 
00:53:46.030 --> 00:53:46.040 align:start position:0%
their list and it's not an inexpensive
 
00:53:48.750 --> 00:53:48.760 align:start position:0%
process either our offices plans to do
 
00:53:52.510 --> 00:53:52.520 align:start position:0%
this twice a year we think it's um um
 
00:53:54.309 --> 00:53:54.319 align:start position:0%
very feasible financially to do it twice
 
00:53:56.789 --> 00:53:56.799 align:start position:0%
a year but also um the the way the
 
00:53:58.829 --> 00:53:58.839 align:start position:0%
language is written about the 90 days
 
00:54:01.430 --> 00:54:01.440 align:start position:0%
before any election there are elections
 
00:54:04.150 --> 00:54:04.160 align:start position:0%
that happen all year round um between
 
00:54:07.069 --> 00:54:07.079 align:start position:0%
Municipal elections School Board
 
00:54:07.079 --> 00:54:09.390 align:start position:0%
Municipal elections School Board
elections

00:54:09.390 --> 00:54:09.400 align:start position:0%
elections
 
00:54:12.789 --> 00:54:12.799 align:start position:0%
um uh presidential primary State primary
 
00:54:15.150 --> 00:54:15.160 align:start position:0%
general elections so that 90 days could
 
00:54:17.430 --> 00:54:17.440 align:start position:0%
happen quite frequently and sometimes
 
00:54:19.710 --> 00:54:19.720 align:start position:0%
those 90 days May overlap with each
 
00:54:23.710 --> 00:54:23.720 align:start position:0%
other um so we're hoping to um just have
 
00:54:25.670 --> 00:54:25.680 align:start position:0%
the language clarified a bit and that
 
00:54:27.870 --> 00:54:27.880 align:start position:0%
you would consider consider two times a
 
00:54:32.109 --> 00:54:32.119 align:start position:0%
year as a um possibility we also note
 
00:54:34.470 --> 00:54:34.480 align:start position:0%
that there are many towns that still are
 
00:54:38.069 --> 00:54:38.079 align:start position:0%
working on cleaning up their um NCA
 
00:54:40.630 --> 00:54:40.640 align:start position:0%
notifications from when we've done when
 
00:54:43.549 --> 00:54:43.559 align:start position:0%
we did the list in August so it is a
 
00:54:46.030 --> 00:54:46.040 align:start position:0%
timec consuming as the sponsor noted a
 
00:54:48.670 --> 00:54:48.680 align:start position:0%
time consuming effort for supervisors to
 
00:54:50.630 --> 00:54:50.640 align:start position:0%
do this
 
00:54:53.349 --> 00:54:53.359 align:start position:0%
um happy to take questions question on
 
00:54:54.910 --> 00:54:54.920 align:start position:0%
the Comm represent
 
00:54:57.910 --> 00:54:57.920 align:start position:0%
toner thank you is Is it feasible then
 
00:54:59.710 --> 00:54:59.720 align:start position:0%
based on what you just said that if you
 
00:55:03.309 --> 00:55:03.319 align:start position:0%
do a database refresh twice a year that
 
00:55:06.990 --> 00:55:07.000 align:start position:0%
the towns can do their thing every
 
00:55:10.230 --> 00:55:10.240 align:start position:0%
election but utilize whatever the most
 
00:55:12.990 --> 00:55:13.000 align:start position:0%
up-to-date um data is from from the
 
00:55:15.349 --> 00:55:15.359 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State thank you for the
 
00:55:17.190 --> 00:55:17.200 align:start position:0%
question so just to clarify it's not a
 
00:55:20.789 --> 00:55:20.799 align:start position:0%
data refresh it's um the each supervisor
 
00:55:22.549 --> 00:55:22.559 align:start position:0%
is getting information that they need to
 
00:55:25.990 --> 00:55:26.000 align:start position:0%
look at individually um Bas for voters
 
00:55:27.750 --> 00:55:27.760 align:start position:0%
in their their towns and they need to
 
00:55:30.349 --> 00:55:30.359 align:start position:0%
look at that each each voter at a time
 
00:55:32.190 --> 00:55:32.200 align:start position:0%
did that voter actually move out of our
 
00:55:33.950 --> 00:55:33.960 align:start position:0%
town and make decision based on what
 
00:55:36.470 --> 00:55:36.480 align:start position:0%
they get so it's it's we're not updating
 
00:55:38.670 --> 00:55:38.680 align:start position:0%
their database the supervisors um
 
00:55:41.430 --> 00:55:41.440 align:start position:0%
control the database updates um based on
 
00:55:45.349 --> 00:55:45.359 align:start position:0%
the information that they receive um and
 
00:55:47.750 --> 00:55:47.760 align:start position:0%
twice a year I think is very feasible I
 
00:55:51.589 --> 00:55:51.599 align:start position:0%
would say um in 25 our plan was going to
 
00:55:56.349 --> 00:55:56.359 align:start position:0%
be to do it in June and November and 26
 
00:55:59.829 --> 00:55:59.839 align:start position:0%
unless a date is changed for the um
 
00:56:03.750 --> 00:56:03.760 align:start position:0%
primary it would be in April and
 
00:56:03.760 --> 00:56:05.430 align:start position:0%
primary it would be in April and
December

00:56:05.430 --> 00:56:05.440 align:start position:0%
December
 
00:56:08.990 --> 00:56:09.000 align:start position:0%
follow so it I'm trying to understand
 
00:56:11.390 --> 00:56:11.400 align:start position:0%
the process
 
00:56:15.270 --> 00:56:15.280 align:start position:0%
is who receives like the post office
 
00:56:19.349 --> 00:56:19.359 align:start position:0%
basically um relocation or whatever like
 
00:56:21.589 --> 00:56:21.599 align:start position:0%
um foring their mail basically
 
00:56:23.230 --> 00:56:23.240 align:start position:0%
identifying that someone's possibly
 
00:56:26.789 --> 00:56:26.799 align:start position:0%
moved who processes that compared to
 
00:56:29.190 --> 00:56:29.200 align:start position:0%
um the voter registration so the
 
00:56:30.750 --> 00:56:30.760 align:start position:0%
supervisors of the checklist or the
 
00:56:33.670 --> 00:56:33.680 align:start position:0%
registers in um Portsmith this case will
 
00:56:36.069 --> 00:56:36.079 align:start position:0%
receive in their electronic in the
 
00:56:38.029 --> 00:56:38.039 align:start position:0%
Statewide voter registration system a
 
00:56:39.990 --> 00:56:40.000 align:start position:0%
list of all the voters that have been
 
00:56:43.990 --> 00:56:44.000 align:start position:0%
identified as people who have um
 
00:56:45.789 --> 00:56:45.799 align:start position:0%
potentially and sometimes and that's why
 
00:56:47.430 --> 00:56:47.440 align:start position:0%
they have to look at them individually
 
00:56:49.950 --> 00:56:49.960 align:start position:0%
they may not be accurate matches um
 
00:56:52.750 --> 00:56:52.760 align:start position:0%
potentially moved out of their town so
 
00:56:55.470 --> 00:56:55.480 align:start position:0%
they they supervisors receive that
 
00:56:57.670 --> 00:56:57.680 align:start position:0%
information because we've uploaded it
 
00:57:00.190 --> 00:57:00.200 align:start position:0%
into the database for each um city or
 
00:57:02.270 --> 00:57:02.280 align:start position:0%
town Ward and they have to make the
 
00:57:05.029 --> 00:57:05.039 align:start position:0%
determination to figure out if they've
 
00:57:07.309 --> 00:57:07.319 align:start position:0%
actually moved out of town um and if
 
00:57:09.589 --> 00:57:09.599 align:start position:0%
they should be removed from the
 
00:57:11.390 --> 00:57:11.400 align:start position:0%
database further questions from the
 
00:57:13.190 --> 00:57:13.200 align:start position:0%
committee we got to come back to
 
00:57:15.510 --> 00:57:15.520 align:start position:0%
representative weary we got to come back
 
00:57:17.789 --> 00:57:17.799 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chair uh thank you
 
00:57:20.589 --> 00:57:20.599 align:start position:0%
deputy secretary for taking my question
 
00:57:25.430 --> 00:57:25.440 align:start position:0%
um so the the once you do this uh
 
00:57:27.390 --> 00:57:27.400 align:start position:0%
process two times a year is there a
 
00:57:29.789 --> 00:57:29.799 align:start position:0%
notification sent out to the city Wards
 
00:57:32.069 --> 00:57:32.079 align:start position:0%
and towns that this has been
 
00:57:35.510 --> 00:57:35.520 align:start position:0%
done thank you yes anytime we've updated
 
00:57:37.630 --> 00:57:37.640 align:start position:0%
the Statewide voter registration system
 
00:57:39.990 --> 00:57:40.000 align:start position:0%
every time they log in the supervisors
 
00:57:43.630 --> 00:57:43.640 align:start position:0%
will see they have this many um NCA um
 
00:57:46.549 --> 00:57:46.559 align:start position:0%
voters to address there's a there's a
 
00:57:48.710 --> 00:57:48.720 align:start position:0%
login screen and they've got a notice
 
00:57:50.630 --> 00:57:50.640 align:start position:0%
you need to address these
 
00:57:53.870 --> 00:57:53.880 align:start position:0%
things further questions representative
 
00:57:54.870 --> 00:57:54.880 align:start position:0%
well I see if anybody else is first
 
00:57:57.349 --> 00:57:57.359 align:start position:0%
repres m thank you didn't mean to
 
00:57:59.589 --> 00:57:59.599 align:start position:0%
interrupt you representative wary I I
 
00:58:01.870 --> 00:58:01.880 align:start position:0%
wanted to just clarify does the office
 
00:58:03.589 --> 00:58:03.599 align:start position:0%
of the Secretary of State support this
 
00:58:07.029 --> 00:58:07.039 align:start position:0%
legislation or endorse it and and I just
 
00:58:08.309 --> 00:58:08.319 align:start position:0%
wanted to clarify
 
00:58:11.470 --> 00:58:11.480 align:start position:0%
that I will say that we support this
 
00:58:14.150 --> 00:58:14.160 align:start position:0%
legislation if it's to be done twice a
 
00:58:18.230 --> 00:58:18.240 align:start position:0%
year um we just the 90 days before of an
 
00:58:20.150 --> 00:58:20.160 align:start position:0%
election will have overlap of other
 
00:58:22.750 --> 00:58:22.760 align:start position:0%
elections and so it would be very
 
00:58:24.510 --> 00:58:24.520 align:start position:0%
difficult to get that information out
 
00:58:27.549 --> 00:58:27.559 align:start position:0%
and done timely by the supervisor visors
 
00:58:29.789 --> 00:58:29.799 align:start position:0%
especially those that have um a
 
00:58:33.069 --> 00:58:33.079 align:start position:0%
different date of a town meeting and a
 
00:58:38.870 --> 00:58:38.880 align:start position:0%
school board meeting um and use the same
 
00:58:41.630 --> 00:58:41.640 align:start position:0%
checklist further questions
 
00:58:43.549 --> 00:58:43.559 align:start position:0%
representative we what I we got to go
 
00:58:45.390 --> 00:58:45.400 align:start position:0%
back to technically representative toner
 
00:58:46.630 --> 00:58:46.640 align:start position:0%
repres toner do you want back in or you
 
00:58:48.150 --> 00:58:48.160 align:start position:0%
all set all right now we go to
 
00:58:50.829 --> 00:58:50.839 align:start position:0%
representative we uh thank you Mr chair
 
00:58:52.430 --> 00:58:52.440 align:start position:0%
uh so
 
00:58:55.910 --> 00:58:55.920 align:start position:0%
uh not to uh craft the amendment now but
 
00:58:55.920 --> 00:58:56.789 align:start position:0%
uh not to uh craft the amendment now but
uh

00:58:56.789 --> 00:58:56.799 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:58:59.270 --> 00:58:59.280 align:start position:0%
would you be okay with um you know
 
00:59:01.990 --> 00:59:02.000 align:start position:0%
within 90 days of the secret Secretary
 
00:59:04.829 --> 00:59:04.839 align:start position:0%
of State issuing a
 
00:59:08.829 --> 00:59:08.839 align:start position:0%
ncoa update um that the supervisors of
 
00:59:11.829 --> 00:59:11.839 align:start position:0%
the checklist would have to call their
 
00:59:15.230 --> 00:59:15.240 align:start position:0%
list accordingly something like that
 
00:59:17.829 --> 00:59:17.839 align:start position:0%
thanks for the question I would um I
 
00:59:19.789 --> 00:59:19.799 align:start position:0%
would refer to I would ask that question
 
00:59:24.230 --> 00:59:24.240 align:start position:0%
to the sponsor um as I said there are I
 
00:59:26.109 --> 00:59:26.119 align:start position:0%
think that's two different things one
 
00:59:27.270 --> 00:59:27.280 align:start position:0%
how many times we give them the
 
00:59:29.470 --> 00:59:29.480 align:start position:0%
information and two when they have to
 
00:59:32.029 --> 00:59:32.039 align:start position:0%
clean it up by
 
00:59:34.510 --> 00:59:34.520 align:start position:0%
so representative Lane I thought this
 
00:59:36.430 --> 00:59:36.440 align:start position:0%
was going to be an easy one two cards I
 
00:59:36.440 --> 00:59:37.789 align:start position:0%
was going to be an easy one two cards I
was

00:59:37.789 --> 00:59:37.799 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:59:40.950 --> 00:59:40.960 align:start position:0%
wrong hey um thanks for taking my
 
00:59:42.630 --> 00:59:42.640 align:start position:0%
question and it's following up on
 
00:59:45.109 --> 00:59:45.119 align:start position:0%
representative we's question when you
 
00:59:48.190 --> 00:59:48.200 align:start position:0%
give the list when you give the list now
 
00:59:51.270 --> 00:59:51.280 align:start position:0%
is there a time um because you mentioned
 
00:59:53.029 --> 00:59:53.039 align:start position:0%
that some towns are still doing it but
 
00:59:55.670 --> 00:59:55.680 align:start position:0%
it sounds like portsman jumped right on
 
00:59:57.990 --> 00:59:58.000 align:start position:0%
it so so when you give them the list is
 
01:00:00.029 --> 01:00:00.039 align:start position:0%
there a time frame that you are
 
01:00:03.109 --> 01:00:03.119 align:start position:0%
expecting it to be done within thanks
 
01:00:04.710 --> 01:00:04.720 align:start position:0%
for the
 
01:00:06.950 --> 01:00:06.960 align:start position:0%
question um there's difference between
 
01:00:09.029 --> 01:00:09.039 align:start position:0%
expectations and law and I don't believe
 
01:00:10.710 --> 01:00:10.720 align:start position:0%
there's anything in law that requires
 
01:00:14.069 --> 01:00:14.079 align:start position:0%
them to um address it in a certain time
 
01:00:16.270 --> 01:00:16.280 align:start position:0%
frame further
 
01:00:18.190 --> 01:00:18.200 align:start position:0%
questions all right seeing none thank
 
01:00:19.990 --> 01:00:20.000 align:start position:0%
you deputy secretary representative Ward
 
01:00:21.230 --> 01:00:21.240 align:start position:0%
you you indicated you may want him to
 
01:00:23.309 --> 01:00:23.319 align:start position:0%
say something else he's going to wave
 
01:00:25.190 --> 01:00:25.200 align:start position:0%
all right if that we'll wait till the
 
01:00:27.109 --> 01:00:27.119 align:start position:0%
unnoticed EX where we won't vote all
 
01:00:29.470 --> 01:00:29.480 align:start position:0%
right with that um I don't have any more
 
01:00:32.190 --> 01:00:32.200 align:start position:0%
pink cards um so representative gusovsky
 
01:00:34.589 --> 01:00:34.599 align:start position:0%
if you could please grab the blue sheet
 
01:00:38.950 --> 01:00:38.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:43.870 --> 01:00:43.880 align:start position:0%
it um online was 132 in support 16 oppos
 
01:00:46.029 --> 01:00:46.039 align:start position:0%
and one neutral but the fluoride people
 
01:00:49.309 --> 01:00:49.319 align:start position:0%
made a return
 
01:00:52.789 --> 01:00:52.799 align:start position:0%
so they really don't want that
 
01:00:56.430 --> 01:00:56.440 align:start position:0%
fluoride um so take it with what you
 
01:00:59.829 --> 01:00:59.839 align:start position:0%
will going to close the public hearing
 
01:01:03.230 --> 01:01:03.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:05.950 --> 01:01:05.960 align:start position:0%
341 uh they are they want the removal of
 
01:01:07.990 --> 01:01:08.000 align:start position:0%
the fluoride uh if you want I'll
 
01:01:09.630 --> 01:01:09.640 align:start position:0%
actually happy to read the quote so you
 
01:01:12.950 --> 01:01:12.960 align:start position:0%
don't think I'm just making it up uh the
 
01:01:15.309 --> 01:01:15.319 align:start position:0%
repeated quote is fluoride lowers IQ it
 
01:01:17.670 --> 01:01:17.680 align:start position:0%
is a toxic substance please stop
 
01:01:20.230 --> 01:01:20.240 align:start position:0%
knowingly poisoning our families so I
 
01:01:23.789 --> 01:01:23.799 align:start position:0%
don't know how um updating the ncoa list
 
01:01:25.990 --> 01:01:26.000 align:start position:0%
is going to impact the fluoride and the
 
01:01:31.349 --> 01:01:31.359 align:start position:0%
IQ but somebody clearly thinks that um
 
01:01:32.750 --> 01:01:32.760 align:start position:0%
this is my filibustering to try to get
 
01:01:35.190 --> 01:01:35.200 align:start position:0%
to 11 if you haven't gathered that's
 
01:01:37.589 --> 01:01:37.599 align:start position:0%
what fluide can do apparently as you can
 
01:01:40.270 --> 01:01:40.280 align:start position:0%
testify on the wrong bill um so I guess
 
01:01:42.270 --> 01:01:42.280 align:start position:0%
we're going to stand the commit is going
 
01:01:44.750 --> 01:01:44.760 align:start position:0%
to stand in recess for till 11:00 a.m.
 
01:01:47.390 --> 01:01:47.400 align:start position:0%
which will be like in seconds so well I
 
01:01:49.309 --> 01:01:49.319 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to jump into exec for you
 
01:01:51.670 --> 01:01:51.680 align:start position:0%
know 10 seconds and it's 11 all right so
 
01:01:54.549 --> 01:01:54.559 align:start position:0%
now we're out of recess um we don't go
 
01:01:56.150 --> 01:01:56.160 align:start position:0%
by that cuz those are always wrong we go
 
01:01:58.870 --> 01:01:58.880 align:start position:0%
by the uh I go by the the internet time
 
01:02:01.190 --> 01:02:01.200 align:start position:0%
which exactly 11 so with that I'm going
 
01:02:02.510 --> 01:02:02.520 align:start position:0%
to open up the public hearing for House
 
01:02:02.520 --> 01:02:03.269 align:start position:0%
to open up the public hearing for House
Bill

01:02:03.269 --> 01:02:03.279 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
01:02:05.910 --> 01:02:05.920 align:start position:0%
281 uh requiring electronic voter
 
01:02:08.109 --> 01:02:08.119 align:start position:0%
checklist to be supplied in a sortable
 
01:02:09.870 --> 01:02:09.880 align:start position:0%
format and I'm going to recognize
 
01:02:12.190 --> 01:02:12.200 align:start position:0%
representative Wei for the purpose of
 
01:02:14.549 --> 01:02:14.559 align:start position:0%
introduction thank you Mr chair and
 
01:02:16.309 --> 01:02:16.319 align:start position:0%
honorable committee members for the
 
01:02:17.950 --> 01:02:17.960 align:start position:0%
record my name is Bob war and I have the
 
01:02:19.430 --> 01:02:19.440 align:start position:0%
privilege of representing Hillsboro
 
01:02:22.230 --> 01:02:22.240 align:start position:0%
District 13 the great town of Hudson
 
01:02:25.069 --> 01:02:25.079 align:start position:0%
this testimony will be exceedingly brief
 
01:02:27.230 --> 01:02:27.240 align:start position:0%
so house buil 281 makes a few simple
 
01:02:29.710 --> 01:02:29.720 align:start position:0%
changes to RSA
 
01:02:32.750 --> 01:02:32.760 align:start position:0%
65715 the ability to obtain a list of
 
01:02:35.349 --> 01:02:35.359 align:start position:0%
absentee voter applicants already exists
 
01:02:39.069 --> 01:02:39.079 align:start position:0%
in the existing statutes and the RSA
 
01:02:40.990 --> 01:02:41.000 align:start position:0%
allows for an electronic version to be
 
01:02:42.710 --> 01:02:42.720 align:start position:0%
provided thereby cutting down the cost
 
01:02:45.589 --> 01:02:45.599 align:start position:0%
on printting out copies of these lists
 
01:02:48.829 --> 01:02:48.839 align:start position:0%
in in obtaining such lists however these
 
01:02:50.750 --> 01:02:50.760 align:start position:0%
have often been provided to various
 
01:02:53.789 --> 01:02:53.799 align:start position:0%
candidates in a PDF format while such a
 
01:02:56.269 --> 01:02:56.279 align:start position:0%
format may be said to while while such a
 
01:02:58.589 --> 01:02:58.599 align:start position:0%
format may be said to be electronic it
 
01:03:01.230 --> 01:03:01.240 align:start position:0%
is not readily userfriendly or easily
 
01:03:03.789 --> 01:03:03.799 align:start position:0%
sortable for the purposes of reviewing
 
01:03:06.150 --> 01:03:06.160 align:start position:0%
such a list this simple Bill enables the
 
01:03:08.510 --> 01:03:08.520 align:start position:0%
recipient of the list to be able to sort
 
01:03:11.029 --> 01:03:11.039 align:start position:0%
through the list for reviewing purposes
 
01:03:13.029 --> 01:03:13.039 align:start position:0%
I will be glad to try and answer any
 
01:03:15.870 --> 01:03:15.880 align:start position:0%
questions the committee may
 
01:03:19.750 --> 01:03:19.760 align:start position:0%
have impressive um questions from the
 
01:03:23.269 --> 01:03:23.279 align:start position:0%
committee representative Lane hi thank
 
01:03:26.630 --> 01:03:26.640 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question um down in on
 
01:03:30.190 --> 01:03:30.200 align:start position:0%
line 15 and again on line 22 you have
 
01:03:32.029 --> 01:03:32.039 align:start position:0%
added voter
 
01:03:35.630 --> 01:03:35.640 align:start position:0%
address um right after you've asked for
 
01:03:38.309 --> 01:03:38.319 align:start position:0%
the voter name and address where
 
01:03:41.269 --> 01:03:41.279 align:start position:0%
registered is that not duplicative and
 
01:03:46.589 --> 01:03:46.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:52.670 --> 01:03:52.680 align:start position:0%
there the uh thank you for your question
 
01:03:56.109 --> 01:03:56.119 align:start position:0%
um I I am you're you're absolutely right
 
01:03:58.630 --> 01:03:58.640 align:start position:0%
I would uh I'd have to go back to the
 
01:04:00.630 --> 01:04:00.640 align:start position:0%
original LSR and see if this was somehow
 
01:04:03.390 --> 01:04:03.400 align:start position:0%
added by
 
01:04:07.309 --> 01:04:07.319 align:start position:0%
um the OS but um it is it is already
 
01:04:10.829 --> 01:04:10.839 align:start position:0%
there as you said so it's well it's
 
01:04:12.109 --> 01:04:12.119 align:start position:0%
there in the first one but not the
 
01:04:16.710 --> 01:04:16.720 align:start position:0%
second 22 22 is necessary 22 is Ah
 
01:04:19.190 --> 01:04:19.200 align:start position:0%
that's that's perhaps the clarification
 
01:04:23.150 --> 01:04:23.160 align:start position:0%
yeah 15 is not 15 15 is redundant 22 is
 
01:04:25.750 --> 01:04:25.760 align:start position:0%
necessary because it confirms that the
 
01:04:28.549 --> 01:04:28.559 align:start position:0%
list would be provided in accordance
 
01:04:30.870 --> 01:04:30.880 align:start position:0%
with that what is up above in three
 
01:04:32.990 --> 01:04:33.000 align:start position:0%
Roman numeral three so thank you for the
 
01:04:34.829 --> 01:04:34.839 align:start position:0%
question because that helps clarify what
 
01:04:36.230 --> 01:04:36.240 align:start position:0%
we need to do to amend I don't know I
 
01:04:37.510 --> 01:04:37.520 align:start position:0%
think I violated the rules I totally
 
01:04:38.630 --> 01:04:38.640 align:start position:0%
didn't ask a question I just made a
 
01:04:41.109 --> 01:04:41.119 align:start position:0%
straightup statement um further
 
01:04:43.029 --> 01:04:43.039 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee messing up
 
01:04:46.829 --> 01:04:46.839 align:start position:0%
with my form I know I know um would you
 
01:04:48.910 --> 01:04:48.920 align:start position:0%
uh I have one uh represent would you
 
01:04:51.549 --> 01:04:51.559 align:start position:0%
would you believe that there um is
 
01:04:54.829 --> 01:04:54.839 align:start position:0%
already debate amongst people about what
 
01:04:57.109 --> 01:04:57.119 align:start position:0%
is a sort of format file type and we
 
01:05:01.029 --> 01:05:01.039 align:start position:0%
should probably Define that so it's not
 
01:05:03.150 --> 01:05:03.160 align:start position:0%
ambiguous while we're already beting
 
01:05:04.349 --> 01:05:04.359 align:start position:0%
this bill would you believe that we need
 
01:05:06.589 --> 01:05:06.599 align:start position:0%
to do that thank you Mr chair I I in
 
01:05:08.829 --> 01:05:08.839 align:start position:0%
fact do believe that knowing that
 
01:05:12.549 --> 01:05:12.559 align:start position:0%
sometimes uh those types of parameters
 
01:05:15.750 --> 01:05:15.760 align:start position:0%
for providing lists can be difficult to
 
01:05:19.069 --> 01:05:19.079 align:start position:0%
ascertain without explicitly Clear
 
01:05:21.309 --> 01:05:21.319 align:start position:0%
Directions excellent all right any other
 
01:05:23.269 --> 01:05:23.279 align:start position:0%
questions see that's how you do it the
 
01:05:26.430 --> 01:05:26.440 align:start position:0%
wood you believes um all right um only
 
01:05:29.870 --> 01:05:29.880 align:start position:0%
other one pink card is deputy secretary
 
01:05:32.269 --> 01:05:32.279 align:start position:0%
Hennessy um so representative Kowski if
 
01:05:43.750 --> 01:05:43.760 align:start position:0%

everybody know that our Statewide voter
 
01:05:55.430 --> 01:05:55.440 align:start position:0%
registration system is able to already
 
01:05:58.190 --> 01:05:58.200 align:start position:0%
give give um a candidate information in
 
01:06:00.150 --> 01:06:00.160 align:start position:0%
a sortable format I believe there's a
 
01:06:03.990 --> 01:06:04.000 align:start position:0%
CSV and Excel option but I can get um
 
01:06:06.430 --> 01:06:06.440 align:start position:0%
the chair that information for language
 
01:06:08.470 --> 01:06:08.480 align:start position:0%
if you're going to amend the bill I
 
01:06:13.150 --> 01:06:13.160 align:start position:0%
would ask that um well one last year the
 
01:06:16.870 --> 01:06:16.880 align:start position:0%
committee made changes to um line 10 or
 
01:06:20.710 --> 01:06:20.720 align:start position:0%
section three of the law and updated um
 
01:06:24.349 --> 01:06:24.359 align:start position:0%

01:06:29.630 --> 01:06:29.640 align:start position:0%
the um same language be updated to
 
01:06:33.670 --> 01:06:33.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:38.510 --> 01:06:38.520 align:start position:0%

was no one on the blue sheet uh on 20
 
01:06:50.069 --> 01:06:50.079 align:start position:0%
online was 22 in support five opposed
 
01:06:51.870 --> 01:06:51.880 align:start position:0%
and only two fluides this time and there
 
01:06:54.829 --> 01:06:54.839 align:start position:0%
were two fluides again so I read the
 
01:06:57.309 --> 01:06:57.319 align:start position:0%
comments I read the comments I don't I
 
01:06:59.990 --> 01:07:00.000 align:start position:0%
read the comments you can't say I don't
 
01:07:02.990 --> 01:07:03.000 align:start position:0%
uh with that we're going to close the
 
01:07:05.870 --> 01:07:05.880 align:start position:0%
public hearing for House Bill 281 uh

um 158 is a recess which we're going to
 
01:10:25.470 --> 01:10:25.480 align:start position:0%
talk about it too um Okay so we've got
 
01:10:28.950 --> 01:10:28.960 align:start position:0%
10 minutes um so what I'm going to do is
 
01:10:30.070 --> 01:10:30.080 align:start position:0%
I'm going to open up the executive
 
01:10:33.470 --> 01:10:33.480 align:start position:0%
session for houseb 423 this is the one
 
01:10:36.790 --> 01:10:36.800 align:start position:0%
about uh signs on public property so
 
01:10:39.030 --> 01:10:39.040 align:start position:0%
here's what I want to do um since we
 
01:10:42.030 --> 01:10:42.040 align:start position:0%
have some time is I want to start um
 
01:10:44.470 --> 01:10:44.480 align:start position:0%
we'll start from the right and I'd like
 
01:10:47.270 --> 01:10:47.280 align:start position:0%
every member so if you could write the
 
01:10:50.070 --> 01:10:50.080 align:start position:0%
law however you
 
01:10:53.350 --> 01:10:53.360 align:start position:0%
wanted what is your i i b take 30
 
01:10:56.430 --> 01:10:56.440 align:start position:0%
seconds to 60 seconds to give me and the
 
01:11:00.110 --> 01:11:00.120 align:start position:0%
the the body what your vision would be
 
01:11:02.030 --> 01:11:02.040 align:start position:0%
because I from talking with various
 
01:11:03.350 --> 01:11:03.360 align:start position:0%
members it's all over the place and I
 
01:11:05.590 --> 01:11:05.600 align:start position:0%
would just like to hear from everybody
 
01:11:08.310 --> 01:11:08.320 align:start position:0%
in a formal setting of what it could be
 
01:11:09.870 --> 01:11:09.880 align:start position:0%
and it can be the current law is fine
 
01:11:11.709 --> 01:11:11.719 align:start position:0%
that that there's no wrong answer here I
 
01:11:13.550 --> 01:11:13.560 align:start position:0%
just I genuinely want to hear so I can
 
01:11:16.550 --> 01:11:16.560 align:start position:0%
get an idea because I would love to get
 
01:11:18.790 --> 01:11:18.800 align:start position:0%
this issue settled so don't don't worry
 
01:11:20.350 --> 01:11:20.360 align:start position:0%
about the language in the bill we're
 
01:11:23.830 --> 01:11:23.840 align:start position:0%
talking about signs on public property
 
01:11:25.709 --> 01:11:25.719 align:start position:0%
so representative kovski if you could
 
01:11:27.830 --> 01:11:27.840 align:start position:0%
indulge us to start cuz I think I've
 
01:11:29.590 --> 01:11:29.600 align:start position:0%
made my position clear
 
01:11:34.189 --> 01:11:34.199 align:start position:0%
so um my view is I would like to have
 
01:11:36.709 --> 01:11:36.719 align:start position:0%
the towns decide what they want to do
 
01:11:39.310 --> 01:11:39.320 align:start position:0%
with the public property in town and
 
01:11:43.070 --> 01:11:43.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:45.229 --> 01:11:45.239 align:start position:0%
highways do you want to come back for
 
01:11:47.550 --> 01:11:47.560 align:start position:0%
that yes okay we'll come back
 
01:11:47.560 --> 01:11:48.830 align:start position:0%
that yes okay we'll come back
representative

01:11:48.830 --> 01:11:48.840 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:11:53.470 --> 01:11:53.480 align:start position:0%
toner um I in my opinion there is an RSA
 
01:11:57.270 --> 01:11:57.280 align:start position:0%
that Outlaws s finds advertisings from
 
01:12:00.910 --> 01:12:00.920 align:start position:0%
political to companies on interstates
 
01:12:04.430 --> 01:12:04.440 align:start position:0%
and and uh turnpikes and that includes
 
01:12:04.440 --> 01:12:05.270 align:start position:0%
and and uh turnpikes and that includes
the

01:12:05.270 --> 01:12:05.280 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:12:08.590 --> 01:12:08.600 align:start position:0%
onramps um so I think that's covered and
 
01:12:11.590 --> 01:12:11.600 align:start position:0%
if that it is the opinion of this
 
01:12:12.669 --> 01:12:12.679 align:start position:0%
committee that law would need to be
 
01:12:15.910 --> 01:12:15.920 align:start position:0%
changed and I I referenced it um when
 
01:12:18.830 --> 01:12:18.840 align:start position:0%
this was originally being discussed as
 
01:12:20.790 --> 01:12:20.800 align:start position:0%
far as like the right of
 
01:12:23.830 --> 01:12:23.840 align:start position:0%
ways um if there's a situation where
 
01:12:26.149 --> 01:12:26.159 align:start position:0%
right way or the state own own land in
 
01:12:29.229 --> 01:12:29.239 align:start position:0%
front of your house I I think like 300
 
01:12:32.350 --> 01:12:32.360 align:start position:0%
yard or something you know um if if that
 
01:12:34.550 --> 01:12:34.560 align:start position:0%
is your property you should be able to
 
01:12:38.070 --> 01:12:38.080 align:start position:0%
remove the sign um and and as far as the
 
01:12:40.830 --> 01:12:40.840 align:start position:0%
right ways my understanding is if it's a
 
01:12:43.270 --> 01:12:43.280 align:start position:0%
RightWay you still can basically either
 
01:12:46.110 --> 01:12:46.120 align:start position:0%
put signs up if it's your property or
 
01:12:48.350 --> 01:12:48.360 align:start position:0%
not that's that's my opinion so just
 
01:12:50.270 --> 01:12:50.280 align:start position:0%
clarify so your kind of a butter
 
01:12:52.750 --> 01:12:52.760 align:start position:0%
standard would be 300 yards effectively
 
01:12:53.709 --> 01:12:53.719 align:start position:0%
I don't want to put words in your mouth
 
01:12:54.790 --> 01:12:54.800 align:start position:0%
just trying to make sure I understand
 
01:12:56.870 --> 01:12:56.880 align:start position:0%
yeah all right representative
 
01:13:00.030 --> 01:13:00.040 align:start position:0%
c i was uh thinking that
 
01:13:03.510 --> 01:13:03.520 align:start position:0%
maybe uh instead of the closest a butter
 
01:13:05.870 --> 01:13:05.880 align:start position:0%
because the butter May own quite a bit
 
01:13:10.030 --> 01:13:10.040 align:start position:0%
of uh Frontage would be just to limit it
 
01:13:13.510 --> 01:13:13.520 align:start position:0%
to some particular distance maybe uh a
 
01:13:15.750 --> 01:13:15.760 align:start position:0%
couple hundred yards from the front of
 
01:13:18.590 --> 01:13:18.600 align:start position:0%
their house or business if that's what
 
01:13:22.790 --> 01:13:22.800 align:start position:0%
it is um as long as it's open
 
01:13:27.830 --> 01:13:27.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:30.510 --> 01:13:30.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question Mr chairman
 
01:13:33.629 --> 01:13:33.639 align:start position:0%
um it's to me it's uh I I've I've not
 
01:13:35.550 --> 01:13:35.560 align:start position:0%
really thought about it except for
 
01:13:38.430 --> 01:13:38.440 align:start position:0%
during election when I see a lot of uh
 
01:13:40.629 --> 01:13:40.639 align:start position:0%
signs and you know all all the highway
 
01:13:43.350 --> 01:13:43.360 align:start position:0%
signs and all this like why why why they
 
01:13:44.870 --> 01:13:44.880 align:start position:0%
do that because what what's the purpose
 
01:13:46.510 --> 01:13:46.520 align:start position:0%
of that because if there are intention
 
01:13:49.110 --> 01:13:49.120 align:start position:0%
of putting signs is to indicate that the
 
01:13:51.590 --> 01:13:51.600 align:start position:0%
owner of the home where we have the sign
 
01:13:54.669 --> 01:13:54.679 align:start position:0%
is uh is your supporter then you know
 
01:13:56.510 --> 01:13:56.520 align:start position:0%
what what's what's indicator of uh if
 
01:13:58.510 --> 01:13:58.520 align:start position:0%
you have your signs on the highway
 
01:14:02.110 --> 01:14:02.120 align:start position:0%
having having said that um to me when if
 
01:14:04.750 --> 01:14:04.760 align:start position:0%
there's a law and then there's a there
 
01:14:08.629 --> 01:14:08.639 align:start position:0%
has to be a way of making sure that uh
 
01:14:10.910 --> 01:14:10.920 align:start position:0%
everyone follows it and if there's no
 
01:14:12.990 --> 01:14:13.000 align:start position:0%
way if like you make a law and there's
 
01:14:16.350 --> 01:14:16.360 align:start position:0%
no way there's no uh for example if the
 
01:14:19.070 --> 01:14:19.080 align:start position:0%
town makes uh those decisions and the
 
01:14:21.910 --> 01:14:21.920 align:start position:0%
town does not have any funds to actually
 
01:14:24.270 --> 01:14:24.280 align:start position:0%
make sure that it's followed then we
 
01:14:27.070 --> 01:14:27.080 align:start position:0%
have a lot of really for nothing so I
 
01:14:29.750 --> 01:14:29.760 align:start position:0%
think uh if uh there's going to be a law
 
01:14:31.270 --> 01:14:31.280 align:start position:0%
there has to be how how it's going to be
 
01:14:33.149 --> 01:14:33.159 align:start position:0%
implemented otherwise I will just stick
 
01:14:36.350 --> 01:14:36.360 align:start position:0%
with what we have representative
 
01:14:38.629 --> 01:14:38.639 align:start position:0%
Mirad I'm not sure I have a good
 
01:14:41.470 --> 01:14:41.480 align:start position:0%
solution but I I I would I do think that
 
01:14:43.510 --> 01:14:43.520 align:start position:0%
there I am convinced there's a need for
 
01:14:46.790 --> 01:14:46.800 align:start position:0%
really clear standard um with respect to
 
01:14:50.750 --> 01:14:50.760 align:start position:0%
federal state and Municipal property um
 
01:14:53.510 --> 01:14:53.520 align:start position:0%
I might just note that the that the the
 
01:14:55.750 --> 01:14:55.760 align:start position:0%
simple idea that the background
 
01:14:57.229 --> 01:14:57.239 align:start position:0%
condition is that signs are not allowed
 
01:14:59.189 --> 01:14:59.199 align:start position:0%
unless explicitly permitted by the state
 
01:15:01.669 --> 01:15:01.679 align:start position:0%
or locality might be problematic for
 
01:15:03.270 --> 01:15:03.280 align:start position:0%
many many residents who live on state
 
01:15:05.870 --> 01:15:05.880 align:start position:0%
highways because the state right of way
 
01:15:08.229 --> 01:15:08.239 align:start position:0%
extends pretty far into their front
 
01:15:10.070 --> 01:15:10.080 align:start position:0%
yards and so they couldn't put their own
 
01:15:13.830 --> 01:15:13.840 align:start position:0%
signs on that property adjacent to the
 
01:15:16.189 --> 01:15:16.199 align:start position:0%
street in a visible manner um because
 
01:15:18.470 --> 01:15:18.480 align:start position:0%
they technically don't own you know that
 
01:15:21.430 --> 01:15:21.440 align:start position:0%
15 or 20ft swath of ground so so just to
 
01:15:22.990 --> 01:15:23.000 align:start position:0%
throw out that complication but I do
 
01:15:25.830 --> 01:15:25.840 align:start position:0%
think you know it's worth continuing to
 
01:15:31.430 --> 01:15:31.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:35.550 --> 01:15:35.560 align:start position:0%
O'Brien I always look at the signs that
 
01:15:37.669 --> 01:15:37.679 align:start position:0%
are out and think about where they're
 
01:15:40.790 --> 01:15:40.800 align:start position:0%
placed is it on someone's property or is
 
01:15:43.470 --> 01:15:43.480 align:start position:0%
it uh elsewhere when it's on someone's
 
01:15:47.310 --> 01:15:47.320 align:start position:0%
property I it means a lot more to me uh
 
01:15:49.870 --> 01:15:49.880 align:start position:0%
but I may be looking at this it might be
 
01:15:51.669 --> 01:15:51.679 align:start position:0%
inside baseball in a sense because I
 
01:15:53.910 --> 01:15:53.920 align:start position:0%
look at it a little differently than
 
01:15:55.990 --> 01:15:56.000 align:start position:0%
most people
 
01:15:59.270 --> 01:15:59.280 align:start position:0%
just no signs on public property and I
 
01:16:00.590 --> 01:16:00.600 align:start position:0%
know that's going to be difficult for
 
01:16:03.430 --> 01:16:03.440 align:start position:0%
communities who have
 
01:16:05.430 --> 01:16:05.440 align:start position:0%
Traditions but that's how that's where
 
01:16:08.070 --> 01:16:08.080 align:start position:0%
I'm at representative Harley
 
01:16:10.310 --> 01:16:10.320 align:start position:0%
bullia thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
01:16:14.350 --> 01:16:14.360 align:start position:0%
the question um I I think at at a bare
 
01:16:17.590 --> 01:16:17.600 align:start position:0%
minimum that we should definitely uh
 
01:16:20.270 --> 01:16:20.280 align:start position:0%
allow a homeowner to remove the signs
 
01:16:22.149 --> 01:16:22.159 align:start position:0%
that are placed directly in front of
 
01:16:24.629 --> 01:16:24.639 align:start position:0%
their home and I know uh representative
 
01:16:27.590 --> 01:16:27.600 align:start position:0%
wer was concerned about that he's on a
 
01:16:31.950 --> 01:16:31.960 align:start position:0%
corner and so if the sign is you know in
 
01:16:34.229 --> 01:16:34.239 align:start position:0%
front of the house it doesn't have to be
 
01:16:36.149 --> 01:16:36.159 align:start position:0%
the facade of the house is fine and then
 
01:16:38.149 --> 01:16:38.159 align:start position:0%
there was and you know the other bill is
 
01:16:39.590 --> 01:16:39.600 align:start position:0%
talking you know there's several bills
 
01:16:42.310 --> 01:16:42.320 align:start position:0%
that talk about uh Butters Butters is
 
01:16:44.189 --> 01:16:44.199 align:start position:0%
not the correct term as far as I know I
 
01:16:46.709 --> 01:16:46.719 align:start position:0%
looked it up and a Butters can be across
 
01:16:49.070 --> 01:16:49.080 align:start position:0%
the street so you could have two people
 
01:16:50.590 --> 01:16:50.600 align:start position:0%
so if you leave it to the abutter to
 
01:16:52.310 --> 01:16:52.320 align:start position:0%
decide it should be a joining is the
 
01:16:54.189 --> 01:16:54.199 align:start position:0%
language they're looking for joining
 
01:16:57.110 --> 01:16:57.120 align:start position:0%
property a budding can be across the
 
01:16:59.870 --> 01:16:59.880 align:start position:0%
street so you could have a conflict with
 
01:17:03.709 --> 01:17:03.719 align:start position:0%
two different people um on who are both
 
01:17:06.470 --> 01:17:06.480 align:start position:0%
equidistant uh but I I did go and I made
 
01:17:10.229 --> 01:17:10.239 align:start position:0%
up these drafts a while ago which if you
 
01:17:13.669 --> 01:17:13.679 align:start position:0%
want but it's um taking Senator Gray's
 
01:17:16.149 --> 01:17:16.159 align:start position:0%
Bill about you know clarifying the ban
 
01:17:19.790 --> 01:17:19.800 align:start position:0%
on uh state property signs and then
 
01:17:21.590 --> 01:17:21.600 align:start position:0%
adding the bid about homeowners being
 
01:17:24.470 --> 01:17:24.480 align:start position:0%
able to remove signs and then yes I
 
01:17:27.470 --> 01:17:27.480 align:start position:0%
think public property you know no signs
 
01:17:29.750 --> 01:17:29.760 align:start position:0%
but that's just me thanks representative
 
01:17:32.110 --> 01:17:32.120 align:start position:0%
wood who has a position Stark opposition
 
01:17:34.070 --> 01:17:34.080 align:start position:0%
of my own but let's hear it yes this I
 
01:17:35.470 --> 01:17:35.480 align:start position:0%
don't think there's anybody here that
 
01:17:38.229 --> 01:17:38.239 align:start position:0%
likes signs as much as I do uh first of
 
01:17:40.629 --> 01:17:40.639 align:start position:0%
all the town our town already baned
 
01:17:43.870 --> 01:17:43.880 align:start position:0%
signs however they don't enforce it and
 
01:17:46.270 --> 01:17:46.280 align:start position:0%
we have what is called the First
 
01:17:50.550 --> 01:17:50.560 align:start position:0%
Amendment rights so people who have just
 
01:17:54.830 --> 01:17:54.840 align:start position:0%
a a point seem to uh get actually better
 
01:17:56.629 --> 01:17:56.639 align:start position:0%
better locations than people running
 
01:18:01.390 --> 01:18:01.400 align:start position:0%
because we're just um uh politicians our
 
01:18:04.550 --> 01:18:04.560 align:start position:0%
Frontage if it's in front of somebody's
 
01:18:07.590 --> 01:18:07.600 align:start position:0%
property take get rid of it everybody
 
01:18:08.910 --> 01:18:08.920 align:start position:0%
understands the frontage in front of
 
01:18:10.910 --> 01:18:10.920 align:start position:0%
their their house one of the few things
 
01:18:13.070 --> 01:18:13.080 align:start position:0%
I have to describe when I was on the on
 
01:18:14.910 --> 01:18:14.920 align:start position:0%
the zoning board or the the planning
 
01:18:17.430 --> 01:18:17.440 align:start position:0%
board if it's in front of your house
 
01:18:20.149 --> 01:18:20.159 align:start position:0%
remove it throw it in the trash so I
 
01:18:22.189 --> 01:18:22.199 align:start position:0%
don't understand what happened before
 
01:18:23.910 --> 01:18:23.920 align:start position:0%
but that's how it should go I don't
 
01:18:25.950 --> 01:18:25.960 align:start position:0%
think we should change the law the
 
01:18:28.030 --> 01:18:28.040 align:start position:0%
actually the state does a great job love
 
01:18:31.910 --> 01:18:31.920 align:start position:0%
the dot we visit them uh twice a week no
 
01:18:34.470 --> 01:18:34.480 align:start position:0%
about twice a month and uh they've taken
 
01:18:38.149 --> 01:18:38.159 align:start position:0%
down signs pretty much they um give us
 
01:18:40.310 --> 01:18:40.320 align:start position:0%
guidance they'll give you guidance it's
 
01:18:43.470 --> 01:18:43.480 align:start position:0%
pretty hard almost all the land is
 
01:18:46.750 --> 01:18:46.760 align:start position:0%
either state owned or Town Road when it
 
01:18:49.950 --> 01:18:49.960 align:start position:0%
gets near the road uh I put signs up on
 
01:18:53.070 --> 01:18:53.080 align:start position:0%
friend's houses that I believe they're
 
01:18:55.030 --> 01:18:55.040 align:start position:0%
the only ones that see it because that's
 
01:18:57.550 --> 01:18:57.560 align:start position:0%
the way property Works in uh Pittsfield
 
01:18:59.669 --> 01:18:59.679 align:start position:0%
and and actually Chester we get a lot of
 
01:19:03.070 --> 01:19:03.080 align:start position:0%
things off the beaten path so um when
 
01:19:05.510 --> 01:19:05.520 align:start position:0%
this bill came out I looked around and
 
01:19:07.830 --> 01:19:07.840 align:start position:0%
almost any place you would put a sign is
 
01:19:11.070 --> 01:19:11.080 align:start position:0%
on state or Town Road the town doesn't
 
01:19:12.709 --> 01:19:12.719 align:start position:0%
maintain what they have now we have
 
01:19:15.990 --> 01:19:16.000 align:start position:0%
signs on polls we have signs for people
 
01:19:18.830 --> 01:19:18.840 align:start position:0%
um sightings and all that stuff those
 
01:19:20.910 --> 01:19:20.920 align:start position:0%
are illegal they don't even take care of
 
01:19:22.870 --> 01:19:22.880 align:start position:0%
those signs which I'm not blaming
 
01:19:24.390 --> 01:19:24.400 align:start position:0%
anybody I'm just saying those are
 
01:19:27.750 --> 01:19:27.760 align:start position:0%
deposit of a nuisance the other thing is
 
01:19:30.270 --> 01:19:30.280 align:start position:0%
that this it's pretty clear that after
 
01:19:33.709 --> 01:19:33.719 align:start position:0%
the election you take them down and uh I
 
01:19:36.629 --> 01:19:36.639 align:start position:0%
pretty much take down any political sign
 
01:19:40.310 --> 01:19:40.320 align:start position:0%
after that uh period I just go out and
 
01:19:44.350 --> 01:19:44.360 align:start position:0%
see my can uh my friend sirel uh is out
 
01:19:46.229 --> 01:19:46.239 align:start position:0%
in the audience and we we go out and we
 
01:19:48.390 --> 01:19:48.400 align:start position:0%
take down the signs both sides by the
 
01:19:51.110 --> 01:19:51.120 align:start position:0%
way we take down both sign after that uh
 
01:19:53.510 --> 01:19:53.520 align:start position:0%
I think it's a Friday uh two weeks after
 
01:19:55.910 --> 01:19:55.920 align:start position:0%
so I think we handle this with the
 
01:19:58.950 --> 01:19:58.960 align:start position:0%
current law representative
 
01:20:01.910 --> 01:20:01.920 align:start position:0%
Ward thank you I would agree with
 
01:20:05.390 --> 01:20:05.400 align:start position:0%
it uh the idea that cities and towns can
 
01:20:06.790 --> 01:20:06.800 align:start position:0%
make up their own minds about these
 
01:20:08.870 --> 01:20:08.880 align:start position:0%
things and seems to work out in a kind
 
01:20:11.750 --> 01:20:11.760 align:start position:0%
of time onor traditional way in our town
 
01:20:15.030 --> 01:20:15.040 align:start position:0%
state law is I don't have an opinion on
 
01:20:16.870 --> 01:20:16.880 align:start position:0%
yet waiting to be
 
01:20:19.430 --> 01:20:19.440 align:start position:0%
educated representative
 
01:20:22.629 --> 01:20:22.639 align:start position:0%
quy thank you Mr
 
01:20:25.189 --> 01:20:25.199 align:start position:0%
chairman I'm particularly interested Ed
 
01:20:28.110 --> 01:20:28.120 align:start position:0%
in the idea of ensuring that
 
01:20:31.830 --> 01:20:31.840 align:start position:0%
homeowners can remove signage
 
01:20:35.470 --> 01:20:35.480 align:start position:0%
from Municipal rights of way or state
 
01:20:38.510 --> 01:20:38.520 align:start position:0%
rights of way on property that adjoins
 
01:20:41.149 --> 01:20:41.159 align:start position:0%
their property now I'm particularly
 
01:20:42.390 --> 01:20:42.400 align:start position:0%
interested because I have a couple of
 
01:20:45.430 --> 01:20:45.440 align:start position:0%
situations like that on my own property
 
01:20:48.149 --> 01:20:48.159 align:start position:0%
I have several hundred feet where the
 
01:20:50.790 --> 01:20:50.800 align:start position:0%
town I looked at my deed the town owns
 
01:20:53.110 --> 01:20:53.120 align:start position:0%
the right of way for the street I live
 
01:20:56.910 --> 01:20:56.920 align:start position:0%
on and the only way I can and where
 
01:20:58.390 --> 01:20:58.400 align:start position:0%
exactly that
 
01:21:01.910 --> 01:21:01.920 align:start position:0%
is is very difficult to determine on the
 
01:21:05.750 --> 01:21:05.760 align:start position:0%
ground because it's a seamless patch of
 
01:21:07.830 --> 01:21:07.840 align:start position:0%
ragged lawn that goes out to the edge of
 
01:21:07.840 --> 01:21:09.270 align:start position:0%
ragged lawn that goes out to the edge of
the

01:21:09.270 --> 01:21:09.280 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:21:12.790 --> 01:21:12.800 align:start position:0%
asphalt uh I have a similar situation
 
01:21:15.750 --> 01:21:15.760 align:start position:0%
because I also live on Route State Route
 
01:21:18.350 --> 01:21:18.360 align:start position:0%
119 one portion of my property of
 
01:21:20.950 --> 01:21:20.960 align:start position:0%
property lines defined as the US
 
01:21:25.310 --> 01:21:25.320 align:start position:0%
geodetic Services uh like the 1,000 30t
 
01:21:28.270 --> 01:21:28.280 align:start position:0%
elevation line try finding that on the
 
01:21:30.830 --> 01:21:30.840 align:start position:0%
ground and another portion of my
 
01:21:34.350 --> 01:21:34.360 align:start position:0%
property it extends to the uh New
 
01:21:34.360 --> 01:21:36.430 align:start position:0%
property it extends to the uh New
Hampshire

01:21:36.430 --> 01:21:36.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
01:21:40.669 --> 01:21:40.679 align:start position:0%
Highway U boundary marker which I think
 
01:21:44.510 --> 01:21:44.520 align:start position:0%
I found it's a a broken concrete
 
01:21:48.149 --> 01:21:48.159 align:start position:0%
stump so if if I could legally remove
 
01:21:50.550 --> 01:21:50.560 align:start position:0%
signs of that people who put up
 
01:21:52.590 --> 01:21:52.600 align:start position:0%
adjoining my
 
01:21:54.910 --> 01:21:54.920 align:start position:0%
property uh not in my case because I'm
 
01:21:56.350 --> 01:21:56.360 align:start position:0%
not going to get in a conflict over
 
01:21:58.750 --> 01:21:58.760 align:start position:0%
something like this but I think it would
 
01:22:01.070 --> 01:22:01.080 align:start position:0%
reduce the potential for conflict around
 
01:22:04.110 --> 01:22:04.120 align:start position:0%
the state between uh candidates and
 
01:22:06.149 --> 01:22:06.159 align:start position:0%
property owners who whose property
 
01:22:08.669 --> 01:22:08.679 align:start position:0%
adjoins where the sign is that's what I
 
01:22:10.550 --> 01:22:10.560 align:start position:0%
would like to see put into effect and I
 
01:22:12.910 --> 01:22:12.920 align:start position:0%
like I like the use of the word adjoin
 
01:22:14.550 --> 01:22:14.560 align:start position:0%
because I think that's much clearer than
 
01:22:18.229 --> 01:22:18.239 align:start position:0%
a butter in this instance yeah okay well
 
01:22:19.629 --> 01:22:19.639 align:start position:0%

burdensome will be burdensome and
 
01:24:18.470 --> 01:24:18.480 align:start position:0%
unnecessary it will be it will add more

confusion about types of ID as is
 
01:24:23.709 --> 01:24:23.719 align:start position:0%
actually necess as is actually necessary
 
01:24:26.270 --> 01:24:26.280 align:start position:0%
and it's adding more factors to report
 
01:24:29.310 --> 01:24:29.320 align:start position:0%
to an already confusing process um for
 
01:24:33.510 --> 01:24:33.520 align:start position:0%

kazasi all right it's blank um so with
 
01:25:03.750 --> 01:25:03.760 align:start position:0%
that I'm going to close the public
 
01:25:06.390 --> 01:25:06.400 align:start position:0%
hearing on House Bill 308 and we're
 
01:25:10.790 --> 01:25:10.800 align:start position:0%
going to reopen the executive session on
 
01:25:12.189 --> 01:25:12.199 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
01:25:16.550 --> 01:25:16.560 align:start position:0%
423 um and um while the clerk gets are
 
01:25:18.109 --> 01:25:18.119 align:start position:0%
you ready to give your opinion on signs
 
01:25:19.669 --> 01:25:19.679 align:start position:0%
and public property would you like me to
 
01:25:23.189 --> 01:25:23.199 align:start position:0%
go I can give my opinion okay
 
01:25:25.350 --> 01:25:25.360 align:start position:0%
okay um um
 
01:25:28.470 --> 01:25:28.480 align:start position:0%
so I think that it should be left to the
 
01:25:32.550 --> 01:25:32.560 align:start position:0%
um the towns and cities uh I represent a
 
01:25:37.270 --> 01:25:37.280 align:start position:0%
town with two Villages and a City ward
 
01:25:39.990 --> 01:25:40.000 align:start position:0%
so they have the City ward has their own
 
01:25:44.109 --> 01:25:44.119 align:start position:0%
rules where you can't um Place signs on
 
01:25:47.510 --> 01:25:47.520 align:start position:0%
their on their public roads so it all
 
01:25:51.109 --> 01:25:51.119 align:start position:0%
has to be done um by permission of U an
 
01:25:53.790 --> 01:25:53.800 align:start position:0%
owner of a business or a home which
 
01:25:55.030 --> 01:25:55.040 align:start position:0%
makes it really difficult when you're
 
01:25:58.430 --> 01:25:58.440 align:start position:0%
not from that area either in my town uh
 
01:26:00.030 --> 01:26:00.040 align:start position:0%
we have two
 
01:26:02.990 --> 01:26:03.000 align:start position:0%
major roads which are state roads and we
 
01:26:05.870 --> 01:26:05.880 align:start position:0%
have the Spalding um Turnpike that runs
 
01:26:08.590 --> 01:26:08.600 align:start position:0%
right between us so those are the only
 
01:26:10.950 --> 01:26:10.960 align:start position:0%
roads that we really have that are
 
01:26:13.430 --> 01:26:13.440 align:start position:0%
available for the public to see unless
 
01:26:16.950 --> 01:26:16.960 align:start position:0%
you're taking back roads to your home um
 
01:26:18.590 --> 01:26:18.600 align:start position:0%
many people like to drive by my home
 
01:26:20.470 --> 01:26:20.480 align:start position:0%
because there's always a lot of signs
 
01:26:22.189 --> 01:26:22.199 align:start position:0%
but I think it makes it really
 
01:26:24.430 --> 01:26:24.440 align:start position:0%
challenging for the individuals that are
 
01:26:28.430 --> 01:26:28.440 align:start position:0%
running locally as well to have another
 
01:26:30.350 --> 01:26:30.360 align:start position:0%
law that they may not be familiar with
 
01:26:33.430 --> 01:26:33.440 align:start position:0%
and that they're breaking I uh and and
 
01:26:37.510 --> 01:26:37.520 align:start position:0%
to be imposed on the local uh authority
 
01:26:40.830 --> 01:26:40.840 align:start position:0%
to follow those procedures I just I
 
01:26:42.470 --> 01:26:42.480 align:start position:0%
think it should be left to the towns and
 
01:26:44.510 --> 01:26:44.520 align:start position:0%
municipalities where it's at I think the
 
01:26:46.669 --> 01:26:46.679 align:start position:0%
state is doing a great job they allow us
 
01:26:50.390 --> 01:26:50.400 align:start position:0%
to have signs along the road none are on
 
01:26:55.470 --> 01:26:55.480 align:start position:0%
the um on ramps or off ramps um so so
 
01:26:57.750 --> 01:26:57.760 align:start position:0%
and they usually allow two weeks for
 
01:26:59.390 --> 01:26:59.400 align:start position:0%
everybody to remove their signs and then
 
01:27:01.950 --> 01:27:01.960 align:start position:0%
they take them so that's where I stand I
 
01:27:03.070 --> 01:27:03.080 align:start position:0%
think we should just leave it alone
 
01:27:06.510 --> 01:27:06.520 align:start position:0%
thank you okay representative
 
01:27:10.910 --> 01:27:10.920 align:start position:0%
Lane um I I'm not exactly sure how I
 
01:27:13.629 --> 01:27:13.639 align:start position:0%
feel about this um and I think part of
 
01:27:16.149 --> 01:27:16.159 align:start position:0%
that is because in my district it's it's
 
01:27:18.390 --> 01:27:18.400 align:start position:0%
hard for me to put signs up because most
 
01:27:21.470 --> 01:27:21.480 align:start position:0%
of them are apartment buildings or uh
 
01:27:23.750 --> 01:27:23.760 align:start position:0%
manufactured home parks or condos that
 
01:27:26.310 --> 01:27:26.320 align:start position:0%
have restrictions against signs so I
 
01:27:27.950 --> 01:27:27.960 align:start position:0%
have a hard time finding a place to put
 
01:27:33.030 --> 01:27:33.040 align:start position:0%
a sign uh in most of my um so including
 
01:27:35.109 --> 01:27:35.119 align:start position:0%
my own condo where I live I can't put my
 
01:27:38.990 --> 01:27:39.000 align:start position:0%
own sign up so um I guess towns and
 
01:27:41.550 --> 01:27:41.560 align:start position:0%
cities I know conquered has some uh
 
01:27:44.629 --> 01:27:44.639 align:start position:0%
guidelines and I I like uh others I'm
 
01:27:46.870 --> 01:27:46.880 align:start position:0%
not quite sure about the state how they
 
01:27:49.149 --> 01:27:49.159 align:start position:0%
want to do it I think you know the law
 
01:27:52.350 --> 01:27:52.360 align:start position:0%
that representative toner mentioned is
 
01:27:56.229 --> 01:27:56.239 align:start position:0%
adequate but I wor about those who are
 
01:27:58.950 --> 01:27:58.960 align:start position:0%
um adjoining I think is the correct term
 
01:28:02.189 --> 01:28:02.199 align:start position:0%
I think that's a great term um it and
 
01:28:05.870 --> 01:28:05.880 align:start position:0%
but do you do it um and I like the idea
 
01:28:08.109 --> 01:28:08.119 align:start position:0%
of a house but a lot of people's houses
 
01:28:10.950 --> 01:28:10.960 align:start position:0%
are way set back so I'm not sure 300
 
01:28:13.750 --> 01:28:13.760 align:start position:0%
yards would be sufficient but I don't
 
01:28:16.470 --> 01:28:16.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:19.910 --> 01:28:19.920 align:start position:0%
answer representative
 
01:28:23.149 --> 01:28:23.159 align:start position:0%
Wy since you created the Paradigm that
 
01:28:25.910 --> 01:28:25.920 align:start position:0%
any ideal thought could go I would say
 
01:28:29.430 --> 01:28:29.440 align:start position:0%
something like this is I'd keep all the
 
01:28:31.430 --> 01:28:31.440 align:start position:0%
other existing laws I'd say right of way
 
01:28:33.070 --> 01:28:33.080 align:start position:0%
shall not pertain to the placement of
 
01:28:35.350 --> 01:28:35.360 align:start position:0%
election signs and the property owner
 
01:28:37.709 --> 01:28:37.719 align:start position:0%
that is a homeowner or a business owner
 
01:28:39.189 --> 01:28:39.199 align:start position:0%
shall have the ability to remove
 
01:28:41.310 --> 01:28:41.320 align:start position:0%
election signs from their property and I
 
01:28:42.950 --> 01:28:42.960 align:start position:0%
would just keep it at
 
01:28:45.510 --> 01:28:45.520 align:start position:0%
that representative
 
01:28:49.470 --> 01:28:49.480 align:start position:0%
Wilhelm uh thank you chairman uh
 
01:28:52.350 --> 01:28:52.360 align:start position:0%
I I think we should make this enabling
 
01:28:54.350 --> 01:28:54.360 align:start position:0%
for municipalities to do what they want
 
01:28:56.669 --> 01:28:56.679 align:start position:0%
but otherwise there should be a ban on
 
01:29:00.669 --> 01:29:00.679 align:start position:0%
putting political signs up around town
 
01:29:03.950 --> 01:29:03.960 align:start position:0%
uh the state question sounds like it's
 
01:29:05.990 --> 01:29:06.000 align:start position:0%
addressed in statute and probably
 
01:29:09.149 --> 01:29:09.159 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be changed um but this has
 
01:29:10.709 --> 01:29:10.719 align:start position:0%
been really helpful listening to what
 
01:29:12.870 --> 01:29:12.880 align:start position:0%
everybody thinks it's why we had to do
 
01:29:15.189 --> 01:29:15.199 align:start position:0%
it because there was just so many ideas
 
01:29:15.199 --> 01:29:16.270 align:start position:0%
it because there was just so many ideas
R

01:29:16.270 --> 01:29:16.280 align:start position:0%
R
 
01:29:19.990 --> 01:29:20.000 align:start position:0%
Nome thank you um I agree with uh many
 
01:29:21.550 --> 01:29:21.560 align:start position:0%
of us I think I've heard today saying
 
01:29:23.750 --> 01:29:23.760 align:start position:0%
that the town decision should be left to
 
01:29:27.870 --> 01:29:27.880 align:start position:0%
the town SS to decide into by them um
 
01:29:31.189 --> 01:29:31.199 align:start position:0%
the state I think current law covers um
 
01:29:32.310 --> 01:29:32.320 align:start position:0%
what it needs
 
01:29:35.790 --> 01:29:35.800 align:start position:0%
to uh as it pertains to a joining or a
 
01:29:38.149 --> 01:29:38.159 align:start position:0%
budding or whatever that word is my
 
01:29:39.669 --> 01:29:39.679 align:start position:0%
concern there is a first amendment
 
01:29:42.550 --> 01:29:42.560 align:start position:0%
constitutional issue where it is
 
01:29:44.990 --> 01:29:45.000 align:start position:0%
state-owned property and we're giving a
 
01:29:47.149 --> 01:29:47.159 align:start position:0%
private citizen the right to control
 
01:29:51.030 --> 01:29:51.040 align:start position:0%
speech on that state land where all of a
 
01:29:52.910 --> 01:29:52.920 align:start position:0%
sudden it's it's no longer content
 
01:29:56.390 --> 01:29:56.400 align:start position:0%
neutral uh um and that to me is a big
 
01:30:00.750 --> 01:30:00.760 align:start position:0%
problem um as well as it's I'm I'm not
 
01:30:02.109 --> 01:30:02.119 align:start position:0%
sure if people have heard the the
 
01:30:03.990 --> 01:30:04.000 align:start position:0%
property rights as a bundle of sticks
 
01:30:08.390 --> 01:30:08.400 align:start position:0%
analogy where each stick is a property
 
01:30:10.990 --> 01:30:11.000 align:start position:0%
right whether it's mineral rights or the
 
01:30:12.790 --> 01:30:12.800 align:start position:0%
right to build as opposed to a
 
01:30:16.030 --> 01:30:16.040 align:start position:0%
conservation easement and giving an
 
01:30:19.229 --> 01:30:19.239 align:start position:0%
abutter or a joiner the right just a
 
01:30:20.750 --> 01:30:20.760 align:start position:0%
property right that's currently held by
 
01:30:23.270 --> 01:30:23.280 align:start position:0%
the state just giving that away to me is
 
01:30:23.280 --> 01:30:24.470 align:start position:0%
the state just giving that away to me is
problematic

01:30:24.470 --> 01:30:24.480 align:start position:0%
problematic
 
01:30:26.430 --> 01:30:26.440 align:start position:0%
uh who's to say that that autter
 
01:30:28.990 --> 01:30:29.000 align:start position:0%
couldn't then charge campaigns as to
 
01:30:33.070 --> 01:30:33.080 align:start position:0%
what's who gets that sign um and that
 
01:30:34.550 --> 01:30:34.560 align:start position:0%
potential for I'm not saying it's going
 
01:30:36.189 --> 01:30:36.199 align:start position:0%
to happen but that potential for
 
01:30:40.189 --> 01:30:40.199 align:start position:0%
monetization of controlled speech is a
 
01:30:43.750 --> 01:30:43.760 align:start position:0%
real problem for me thank you okay and
 
01:30:43.760 --> 01:30:45.030 align:start position:0%
real problem for me thank you okay and
representative

01:30:45.030 --> 01:30:45.040 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:30:48.109 --> 01:30:48.119 align:start position:0%
Gilmore well I think all political
 
01:30:49.870 --> 01:30:49.880 align:start position:0%
signage should be on the property
 
01:30:52.070 --> 01:30:52.080 align:start position:0%
personal property of its
 
01:30:55.149 --> 01:30:55.159 align:start position:0%
supporters that's it
 
01:30:58.070 --> 01:30:58.080 align:start position:0%
he's on team total ban um okay and I'll
 
01:31:02.229 --> 01:31:02.239 align:start position:0%
I'll kind of reiterate my position um
 
01:31:07.030 --> 01:31:07.040 align:start position:0%
so I I I like the idea of a total ban on
 
01:31:09.950 --> 01:31:09.960 align:start position:0%
Town property um and County property
 
01:31:12.470 --> 01:31:12.480 align:start position:0%
Byer County um total ban on Town and
 
01:31:14.790 --> 01:31:14.800 align:start position:0%
County property um but the towns or
 
01:31:17.030 --> 01:31:17.040 align:start position:0%
counties can adopt ordinances to allow
 
01:31:19.149 --> 01:31:19.159 align:start position:0%
it in specific times and specific
 
01:31:21.189 --> 01:31:21.199 align:start position:0%
locations um so if they want to do the
 
01:31:23.189 --> 01:31:23.199 align:start position:0%
free-for-all on the corner they can
 
01:31:24.350 --> 01:31:24.360 align:start position:0%
designate the corner corner for the
 
01:31:26.470 --> 01:31:26.480 align:start position:0%
free-for-all if they want to do total
 
01:31:29.470 --> 01:31:29.480 align:start position:0%
ban they can do total ban um and it's a
 
01:31:33.629 --> 01:31:33.639 align:start position:0%
local control issue um so that's that
 
01:31:35.430 --> 01:31:35.440 align:start position:0%
that's where I am on Town and County
 
01:31:37.950 --> 01:31:37.960 align:start position:0%
when it comes to state-owned right of
 
01:31:40.830 --> 01:31:40.840 align:start position:0%
way so you know I have a RightWay on my
 
01:31:43.030 --> 01:31:43.040 align:start position:0%
property for a private the person that
 
01:31:44.590 --> 01:31:44.600 align:start position:0%
lives behind me they have a right of way
 
01:31:48.830 --> 01:31:48.840 align:start position:0%
driveway over over my land um so I think
 
01:31:51.109 --> 01:31:51.119 align:start position:0%
I maybe I'm confused or someone or
 
01:31:53.629 --> 01:31:53.639 align:start position:0%
that's not being conveyed properly about
 
01:31:55.910 --> 01:31:55.920 align:start position:0%
um you still own that land even though a
 
01:31:57.790 --> 01:31:57.800 align:start position:0%
highway you can you can own a land that
 
01:31:59.790 --> 01:31:59.800 align:start position:0%
a highway runs over it's a state has a
 
01:32:02.550 --> 01:32:02.560 align:start position:0%
right of way over your land you still
 
01:32:06.550 --> 01:32:06.560 align:start position:0%
own the land um so I think that's where
 
01:32:07.870 --> 01:32:07.880 align:start position:0%
I think I think we need to clarify what
 
01:32:09.510 --> 01:32:09.520 align:start position:0%
we're talking about there if I own that
 
01:32:11.629 --> 01:32:11.639 align:start position:0%
land I should be able even though even
 
01:32:13.430 --> 01:32:13.440 align:start position:0%
if there's a state-owned right of way I
 
01:32:15.390 --> 01:32:15.400 align:start position:0%
should be able to put my sign on that
 
01:32:17.629 --> 01:32:17.639 align:start position:0%
land because I own that land provided
 
01:32:19.390 --> 01:32:19.400 align:start position:0%
it's not blocking a sight line or
 
01:32:20.790 --> 01:32:20.800 align:start position:0%
causing some sort of traffic Hazard but
 
01:32:22.629 --> 01:32:22.639 align:start position:0%
I own that land the state happens to
 
01:32:24.350 --> 01:32:24.360 align:start position:0%
have a highway over it but I own that
 
01:32:27.790 --> 01:32:27.800 align:start position:0%
land um so that that's my world view on
 
01:32:29.830 --> 01:32:29.840 align:start position:0%
that um outside of that specific
 
01:32:32.030 --> 01:32:32.040 align:start position:0%
situation I would say total ban on state
 
01:32:33.390 --> 01:32:33.400 align:start position:0%
land because now you're talking about
 
01:32:35.310 --> 01:32:35.320 align:start position:0%
putting them up in state parks right
 
01:32:36.990 --> 01:32:37.000 align:start position:0%
you're talking about um all sort of
 
01:32:39.709 --> 01:32:39.719 align:start position:0%
things and I agree with repr of Nome on
 
01:32:42.390 --> 01:32:42.400 align:start position:0%
the idea of it's coerced speech it's no
 
01:32:44.070 --> 01:32:44.080 align:start position:0%
longer I love that term content neutral
 
01:32:45.990 --> 01:32:46.000 align:start position:0%
it's no it's now coerced speech it's a
 
01:32:48.590 --> 01:32:48.600 align:start position:0%
public forum that you have now invaded
 
01:32:50.629 --> 01:32:50.639 align:start position:0%
um and you're you're putting your speech
 
01:32:53.149 --> 01:32:53.159 align:start position:0%
out there and I think you know I have a
 
01:32:55.430 --> 01:32:55.440 align:start position:0%
district now you know I had Manchester
 
01:32:57.350 --> 01:32:57.360 align:start position:0%
and Lichfield at one point um but I've
 
01:32:59.229 --> 01:32:59.239 align:start position:0%
had I've had farming communities I've
 
01:33:01.550 --> 01:33:01.560 align:start position:0%
had urban communities now I have a town
 
01:33:03.350 --> 01:33:03.360 align:start position:0%
with a village but it's also Rural and I
 
01:33:04.990 --> 01:33:05.000 align:start position:0%
live in a very rural town so like I I've
 
01:33:07.790 --> 01:33:07.800 align:start position:0%
seen I guess I've like seen it all um
 
01:33:11.229 --> 01:33:11.239 align:start position:0%
and I don't think you know in in where
 
01:33:14.590 --> 01:33:14.600 align:start position:0%
you've got Route 77 Route 149 Route 114
 
01:33:16.189 --> 01:33:16.199 align:start position:0%
um those are the main drags through town
 
01:33:18.870 --> 01:33:18.880 align:start position:0%
114 and 77 being the two main ones um
 
01:33:20.229 --> 01:33:20.239 align:start position:0%
149 is just basically going to New
 
01:33:22.390 --> 01:33:22.400 align:start position:0%
Boston but
 
01:33:25.709 --> 01:33:25.719 align:start position:0%
um there's you know even on those
 
01:33:27.669 --> 01:33:27.679 align:start position:0%
highways those are state owned highways
 
01:33:30.350 --> 01:33:30.360 align:start position:0%
like there's businesses there's houses
 
01:33:32.550 --> 01:33:32.560 align:start position:0%
like there's no I have no problem
 
01:33:35.030 --> 01:33:35.040 align:start position:0%
putting my signs up on those
 
01:33:37.189 --> 01:33:37.199 align:start position:0%
highways cuz there were homes and there
 
01:33:38.709 --> 01:33:38.719 align:start position:0%
was all sorts of places to put them and
 
01:33:40.669 --> 01:33:40.679 align:start position:0%
it was not a problem um and I've never
 
01:33:42.790 --> 01:33:42.800 align:start position:0%
seen a situation like in Chichester like
 
01:33:44.149 --> 01:33:44.159 align:start position:0%
my business is an epom I drive through
 
01:33:46.430 --> 01:33:46.440 align:start position:0%
Chichester on Route 4 literally every
 
01:33:50.430 --> 01:33:50.440 align:start position:0%
day literally every day there is that
 
01:33:53.350 --> 01:33:53.360 align:start position:0%
place that sells buffalo meat there is
 
01:33:55.750 --> 01:33:55.760 align:start position:0%
that there's multiple car dealerships
 
01:33:58.270 --> 01:33:58.280 align:start position:0%
there's homes there's a lot respectively
 
01:34:01.350 --> 01:34:01.360 align:start position:0%
repr with there's a lot of private land
 
01:34:03.629 --> 01:34:03.639 align:start position:0%
through there half of my staff lives in
 
01:34:05.830 --> 01:34:05.840 align:start position:0%
Pittsfield so I'm in Pittsfield all the
 
01:34:08.790 --> 01:34:08.800 align:start position:0%
time there's a lot of I that's is that
 
01:34:11.470 --> 01:34:11.480 align:start position:0%
28 that goes through Pittsfield
 
01:34:16.669 --> 01:34:16.679 align:start position:0%
see familiar right um so I I would
 
01:34:18.109 --> 01:34:18.119 align:start position:0%
respectfully disagree I think there are
 
01:34:19.510 --> 01:34:19.520 align:start position:0%
opportunities for you I mean you guys
 
01:34:21.030 --> 01:34:21.040 align:start position:0%
have that one spot where it makes a
 
01:34:24.669 --> 01:34:24.679 align:start position:0%
diamond a triangle um on Route 28 but
 
01:34:27.189 --> 01:34:27.199 align:start position:0%
it's the cut through from Route 4 people
 
01:34:28.470 --> 01:34:28.480 align:start position:0%
cut through that little that little
 
01:34:31.709 --> 01:34:31.719 align:start position:0%
Center um yeah and there's a lot of
 
01:34:36.189 --> 01:34:36.199 align:start position:0%
signs in there right um yeah so but I I
 
01:34:38.270 --> 01:34:38.280 align:start position:0%
guess my point like to kind of come back
 
01:34:40.430 --> 01:34:40.440 align:start position:0%
full circle is I think the rules need to
 
01:34:42.030 --> 01:34:42.040 align:start position:0%
be I think the rules from the state need
 
01:34:45.070 --> 01:34:45.080 align:start position:0%
to be uniform I am wary about getting
 
01:34:47.350 --> 01:34:47.360 align:start position:0%
into this world of a joiner and a butter
 
01:34:48.550 --> 01:34:48.560 align:start position:0%
because then it's going to create
 
01:34:51.390 --> 01:34:51.400 align:start position:0%
conflict um but I do sympathize with the
 
01:34:53.910 --> 01:34:53.920 align:start position:0%
argument of you know if somebody puts a
 
01:34:55.950 --> 01:34:55.960 align:start position:0%
sign it looks like it's your house but
 
01:34:57.870 --> 01:34:57.880 align:start position:0%
if we ban it on State Property totally
 
01:34:59.430 --> 01:34:59.440 align:start position:0%
then that's not really a problem anymore
 
01:35:04.270 --> 01:35:04.280 align:start position:0%
now is it um right so I don't know
 
01:35:05.870 --> 01:35:05.880 align:start position:0%
that's where I'm at um representative
 
01:35:07.390 --> 01:35:07.400 align:start position:0%
Penza you're here we've we've already
 
01:35:08.990 --> 01:35:09.000 align:start position:0%
done your bill but I will allow you to
 
01:35:11.310 --> 01:35:11.320 align:start position:0%
introduce it if you'd like if there's
 
01:35:12.830 --> 01:35:12.840 align:start position:0%
not an objection to reopening the public
 
01:35:14.830 --> 01:35:14.840 align:start position:0%
hearing for it I don't have an objection
 
01:35:17.350 --> 01:35:17.360 align:start position:0%
it's just um when we come back I have a
 
01:35:19.149 --> 01:35:19.159 align:start position:0%
clarification on the easement piece for
 
01:35:20.830 --> 01:35:20.840 align:start position:0%
you yes okay so I will I will come out
 
01:35:22.870 --> 01:35:22.880 align:start position:0%
of executive session and we will reopen
 
01:35:30.550 --> 01:35:30.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:33.510 --> 01:35:33.520 align:start position:0%
introduction got to press the button
 
01:35:36.390 --> 01:35:36.400 align:start position:0%
there thank you Mr chair uh for the
 
01:35:39.910 --> 01:35:39.920 align:start position:0%
record um representative Kelly Penza
 
01:35:43.470 --> 01:35:43.480 align:start position:0%
straford District 19 I'm so sorry I um I
 
01:35:46.310 --> 01:35:46.320 align:start position:0%
was looking we were in exec session and
 
01:35:48.030 --> 01:35:48.040 align:start position:0%
I was looking at the clock and looking
 
01:35:52.149 --> 01:35:52.159 align:start position:0%
at my schedule and and realizing I um I
 
01:35:54.709 --> 01:35:54.719 align:start position:0%
wasn't here in time um um thank you for
 
01:35:56.830 --> 01:35:56.840 align:start position:0%
opening it back up
 
01:36:03.109 --> 01:36:03.119 align:start position:0%
so when I worked with OS on this um it's
 
01:36:06.709 --> 01:36:06.719 align:start position:0%
because there are um there in straford
 
01:36:09.830 --> 01:36:09.840 align:start position:0%
County there are some polling areas that
 
01:36:13.229 --> 01:36:13.239 align:start position:0%
are not following I guess what protocol
 
01:36:17.629 --> 01:36:17.639 align:start position:0%
is which is this column that if it is a
 
01:36:21.310 --> 01:36:21.320 align:start position:0%
autate um New Hampshire for of
 
01:36:23.830 --> 01:36:23.840 align:start position:0%
identification that they basically say
 
01:36:26.229 --> 01:36:26.239 align:start position:0%
what form of identification it is and
 
01:36:29.470 --> 01:36:29.480 align:start position:0%
then they list you know the state um
 
01:36:31.590 --> 01:36:31.600 align:start position:0%
that's not happening I know that that's
 
01:36:34.870 --> 01:36:34.880 align:start position:0%
probably in and maybe um secretary
 
01:36:37.270 --> 01:36:37.280 align:start position:0%
scandin can speak about that I think it
 
01:36:40.109 --> 01:36:40.119 align:start position:0%
it is in the election manual but when I
 
01:36:43.629 --> 01:36:43.639 align:start position:0%
asked if it was actually in statute ol
 
01:36:46.109 --> 01:36:46.119 align:start position:0%
searched for it and said it wasn't and
 
01:36:49.030 --> 01:36:49.040 align:start position:0%
so that's why it's now in there so
 
01:36:51.750 --> 01:36:51.760 align:start position:0%
basically you know my bill is you know
 
01:36:55.470 --> 01:36:55.480 align:start position:0%
1819 and 20 and it's just um for it to
 
01:36:57.270 --> 01:36:57.280 align:start position:0%
be there now I have heard when I
 
01:37:00.510 --> 01:37:00.520 align:start position:0%
introduced this bill I heard from um
 
01:37:02.750 --> 01:37:02.760 align:start position:0%
supervisors of the checklist in
 
01:37:04.350 --> 01:37:04.360 align:start position:0%
different places around the state and
 
01:37:05.830 --> 01:37:05.840 align:start position:0%
they said well that's that's it's
 
01:37:08.790 --> 01:37:08.800 align:start position:0%
already there but the problem is is that
 
01:37:11.149 --> 01:37:11.159 align:start position:0%
it's not consistently being used or
 
01:37:15.310 --> 01:37:15.320 align:start position:0%
utilized so um I put it in statute for
 
01:37:17.709 --> 01:37:17.719 align:start position:0%
that reason I know that that column is
 
01:37:20.830 --> 01:37:20.840 align:start position:0%
there um but it's not necessarily being
 
01:37:25.590 --> 01:37:25.600 align:start position:0%
used so for example um um we had a a
 
01:37:29.510 --> 01:37:29.520 align:start position:0%
poll um a poll Challenger that was um
 
01:37:32.590 --> 01:37:32.600 align:start position:0%
that spoke to uh four people as they
 
01:37:36.790 --> 01:37:36.800 align:start position:0%
were checking people in um this was in
 
01:37:38.669 --> 01:37:38.679 align:start position:0%
this was in Durham for example and they
 
01:37:42.070 --> 01:37:42.080 align:start position:0%
were not familiar with having to do that
 
01:37:45.430 --> 01:37:45.440 align:start position:0%
for any other identification that was
 
01:37:49.149 --> 01:37:49.159 align:start position:0%
outside of um New Hampshire so some
 
01:37:51.229 --> 01:37:51.239 align:start position:0%
people did it and some people didn't and
 
01:37:53.830 --> 01:37:53.840 align:start position:0%
so that's that's the reason why it is
 
01:37:57.950 --> 01:37:57.960 align:start position:0%
here right now um secretary skinin would
 
01:38:00.550 --> 01:38:00.560 align:start position:0%
you speak to that could you speak to
 
01:38:02.270 --> 01:38:02.280 align:start position:0%
that that's that's uh I don't know if we
 
01:38:03.910 --> 01:38:03.920 align:start position:0%
can do that I don't know if you can do
 
01:38:05.870 --> 01:38:05.880 align:start position:0%
that because it would be very important
 
01:38:08.470 --> 01:38:08.480 align:start position:0%
to to kind of understand where it is in
 
01:38:10.470 --> 01:38:10.480 align:start position:0%
the election manual not necessarily he
 
01:38:14.189 --> 01:38:14.199 align:start position:0%
knows that off the top of his head so um
 
01:38:16.149 --> 01:38:16.159 align:start position:0%
I was told it's not in Statue anywhere
 
01:38:18.430 --> 01:38:18.440 align:start position:0%
that's why those those uh three lines
 
01:38:20.790 --> 01:38:20.800 align:start position:0%
are put in and that's pretty much it and
 
01:38:23.750 --> 01:38:23.760 align:start position:0%
I hopefully it becomes commonplace that
 
01:38:25.950 --> 01:38:25.960 align:start position:0%
it's just one of the procedures that is
 
01:38:28.270 --> 01:38:28.280 align:start position:0%
happening with um people that are
 
01:38:30.350 --> 01:38:30.360 align:start position:0%
checking in
 
01:38:32.189 --> 01:38:32.199 align:start position:0%
voters question will you be taking
 
01:38:34.270 --> 01:38:34.280 align:start position:0%
questions sure are there questions from
 
01:38:37.149 --> 01:38:37.159 align:start position:0%
the committee yes represent Newsome
 
01:38:38.189 --> 01:38:38.199 align:start position:0%
thank you very much and thank you for
 
01:38:40.229 --> 01:38:40.239 align:start position:0%
taking my question would you be open to
 
01:38:42.830 --> 01:38:42.840 align:start position:0%
an amendment changing supervisors to
 
01:38:44.709 --> 01:38:44.719 align:start position:0%
include ballot clerks since they're the
 
01:38:47.470 --> 01:38:47.480 align:start position:0%
ones doing the checking
 
01:38:50.990 --> 01:38:51.000 align:start position:0%
in well it's just a um it just said
 
01:38:52.709 --> 01:38:52.719 align:start position:0%
basically says the checklist shall have
 
01:38:54.350 --> 01:38:54.360 align:start position:0%
a column four
 
01:38:57.870 --> 01:38:57.880 align:start position:0%
supervisors so supervisors doesn't
 
01:38:59.990 --> 01:39:00.000 align:start position:0%
necessarily mean supervisor of the
 
01:39:01.950 --> 01:39:01.960 align:start position:0%
checklist it could mean ballot C but you
 
01:39:03.709 --> 01:39:03.719 align:start position:0%
could change that wording if that would
 
01:39:05.830 --> 01:39:05.840 align:start position:0%
be if that that's that's no problem for
 
01:39:07.149 --> 01:39:07.159 align:start position:0%

01:39:09.629 --> 01:39:09.639 align:start position:0%

01:39:52.910 --> 01:39:52.920 align:start position:0%
was from the sponsor so now that she did
 
01:39:54.870 --> 01:39:54.880 align:start position:0%
um give intentions I just want to point
 
01:39:58.189 --> 01:39:58.199 align:start position:0%
to the section of the law that um is not
 
01:40:00.350 --> 01:40:00.360 align:start position:0%
addressed in the legislation there is a
 
01:40:02.310 --> 01:40:02.320 align:start position:0%
different section of law that goes over
 
01:40:06.430 --> 01:40:06.440 align:start position:0%
what happens on Election Day and
 
01:40:09.830 --> 01:40:09.840 align:start position:0%

01:40:12.870 --> 01:40:12.880 align:start position:0%

01:40:12.880 --> 01:40:14.430 align:start position:0%
it does say sorry I have to put my
cheaters

01:40:14.430 --> 01:40:14.440 align:start position:0%
cheaters
 
01:40:14.440 --> 01:40:17.709 align:start position:0%
cheaters
on

01:40:17.709 --> 01:40:17.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:20.229 --> 01:40:20.239 align:start position:0%
um the ballot clerk shall record the
 
01:40:22.270 --> 01:40:22.280 align:start position:0%
state of issuance on the checklist in
 
01:40:23.910 --> 01:40:23.920 align:start position:0%
accordance with uniform procedures
 
01:40:25.910 --> 01:40:25.920 align:start position:0%
developed by the Secretary of State and
 
01:40:30.030 --> 01:40:30.040 align:start position:0%
the color designated for such entries
 
01:40:32.709 --> 01:40:32.719 align:start position:0%
um uh shall record the state of issuance
 
01:40:34.430 --> 01:40:34.440 align:start position:0%
of the voter's driver's license or
 
01:40:36.229 --> 01:40:36.239 align:start position:0%
identification card in the Statewide
 
01:40:38.510 --> 01:40:38.520 align:start position:0%
voter registration centralized voter
 
01:40:40.390 --> 01:40:40.400 align:start position:0%
registration data of Base within 30 days
 
01:40:43.990 --> 01:40:44.000 align:start position:0%
of the election so the ballot clerks do
 
01:40:46.629 --> 01:40:46.639 align:start position:0%
Mark what um state if it comes from an
 
01:40:50.390 --> 01:40:50.400 align:start position:0%
out of state um the the ID is from
 
01:40:52.750 --> 01:40:52.760 align:start position:0%
currently on on the checklist and have
 
01:40:55.990 --> 01:40:56.000 align:start position:0%
to record that in SVS when they upload
 
01:40:59.270 --> 01:40:59.280 align:start position:0%
the information um but I noted that in
 
01:41:01.430 --> 01:41:01.440 align:start position:0%
the legislation it was asking for some
 
01:41:03.709 --> 01:41:03.719 align:start position:0%
additional information like what kind of
 
01:41:07.350 --> 01:41:07.360 align:start position:0%
identification was used um so if that is
 
01:41:10.669 --> 01:41:10.679 align:start position:0%
the intent um much like another bill
 
01:41:12.990 --> 01:41:13.000 align:start position:0%
that we discussed on Friday in the
 
01:41:15.189 --> 01:41:15.199 align:start position:0%
subcommittee um there may be some
 
01:41:17.589 --> 01:41:17.599 align:start position:0%
additional space that is needed on the
 
01:41:19.870 --> 01:41:19.880 align:start position:0%
checklist and when a spa additional
 
01:41:21.510 --> 01:41:21.520 align:start position:0%
space is needed if you've ever looked at
 
01:41:23.390 --> 01:41:23.400 align:start position:0%
a checklist it already has a lot of
 
01:41:25.430 --> 01:41:25.440 align:start position:0%
information on the line we may need to
 
01:41:27.149 --> 01:41:27.159 align:start position:0%
put an additional line which could
 
01:41:29.310 --> 01:41:29.320 align:start position:0%
double the size of the checklist so if
 
01:41:31.790 --> 01:41:31.800 align:start position:0%
your town has 1300 Pages currently for a
 
01:41:35.550 --> 01:41:35.560 align:start position:0%
checklist it could cause um 2600 page
 
01:41:37.350 --> 01:41:37.360 align:start position:0%
checklists to be printed
 
01:41:39.669 --> 01:41:39.679 align:start position:0%
out will you be taking questions I'm
 
01:41:41.550 --> 01:41:41.560 align:start position:0%
happy to take questions okay are there
 
01:41:44.589 --> 01:41:44.599 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee um I have a
 
01:41:46.070 --> 01:41:46.080 align:start position:0%
question if no one else does do we
 
01:41:48.830 --> 01:41:48.840 align:start position:0%
release a report on I'm going to switch
 
01:41:52.990 --> 01:41:53.000 align:start position:0%
over to 659 since it's the same subject
 
01:41:57.669 --> 01:41:57.679 align:start position:0%
um do we release the report of the
 
01:41:59.790 --> 01:41:59.800 align:start position:0%
states with the out do we release an
 
01:42:01.910 --> 01:42:01.920 align:start position:0%
aggregated report for which states we're
 
01:42:04.350 --> 01:42:04.360 align:start position:0%
seeing the IDS from um my understanding
 
01:42:06.270 --> 01:42:06.280 align:start position:0%
is no we've not released one and the
 
01:42:07.910 --> 01:42:07.920 align:start position:0%
chair of the subcommittee has asked me
 
01:42:09.629 --> 01:42:09.639 align:start position:0%
to look into that to see if he could get
 
01:42:12.870 --> 01:42:12.880 align:start position:0%
a report so that's on my to-do list okay
 
01:42:14.870 --> 01:42:14.880 align:start position:0%
any other questions from the
 
01:42:17.070 --> 01:42:17.080 align:start position:0%
committee okay that's it all right so we
 
01:42:18.510 --> 01:42:18.520 align:start position:0%
will reclose
 
01:42:21.229 --> 01:42:21.239 align:start position:0%
308 uh and it's 11:40 so we don't get to
 
01:42:24.709 --> 01:42:24.719 align:start position:0%
talk about signs anymore um I know
 
01:42:27.510 --> 01:42:27.520 align:start position:0%
you're devastated I actually am de I for
 
01:42:28.830 --> 01:42:28.840 align:start position:0%
what it's worth I actually enjoy that
 
01:42:31.470 --> 01:42:31.480 align:start position:0%
conversation so I if you're bored by it
 
01:42:33.870 --> 01:42:33.880 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry we're going to keep doing it
 
01:42:35.790 --> 01:42:35.800 align:start position:0%

01:43:41.550 --> 01:43:41.560 align:start position:0%
floral and the way the system worked the
 
01:43:43.750 --> 01:43:43.760 align:start position:0%
same person was first on the ballot in
 
01:43:45.109 --> 01:43:45.119 align:start position:0%
all four
 
01:43:47.510 --> 01:43:47.520 align:start position:0%
towns and I had went in front of the
 
01:43:49.070 --> 01:43:49.080 align:start position:0%
ballot commission and said this was
 
01:43:51.470 --> 01:43:51.480 align:start position:0%
wrong because most people when you get
 
01:43:53.310 --> 01:43:53.320 align:start position:0%
that far down the ballot they just
 
01:43:55.310 --> 01:43:55.320 align:start position:0%
checked the first name well they
 
01:43:57.589 --> 01:43:57.599 align:start position:0%
reminded me that it was legal completely
 
01:44:00.589 --> 01:44:00.599 align:start position:0%
legal and secretary scanon was there but
 
01:44:01.950 --> 01:44:01.960 align:start position:0%
they reminded me that I was probably
 
01:44:03.950 --> 01:44:03.960 align:start position:0%
going to win don't worry I can change
 
01:44:07.229 --> 01:44:07.239 align:start position:0%
the law once I get in well I didn't win
 
01:44:09.629 --> 01:44:09.639 align:start position:0%
and the person that beat me beat uh beat
 
01:44:11.350 --> 01:44:11.360 align:start position:0%
the opponent by six
 
01:44:13.750 --> 01:44:13.760 align:start position:0%
votes now I'm proud to say that I beat
 
01:44:17.470 --> 01:44:17.480 align:start position:0%
the incumbent by 835 votes but it just
 
01:44:19.830 --> 01:44:19.840 align:start position:0%
seemed like it was four years too late
 
01:44:22.070 --> 01:44:22.080 align:start position:0%
but anyway um after introducing the
 
01:44:24.910 --> 01:44:24.920 align:start position:0%
legislation uh or the bill excuse me the
 
01:44:26.870 --> 01:44:26.880 align:start position:0%
uh secretary brought it to my attention
 
01:44:28.229 --> 01:44:28.239 align:start position:0%
that he wanted to look at it and massage
 
01:44:29.589 --> 01:44:29.599 align:start position:0%
it a little bit and who am I going to
 
01:44:31.870 --> 01:44:31.880 align:start position:0%
deny the Secretary of State looking over
 
01:44:34.390 --> 01:44:34.400 align:start position:0%
my bill and he made the changes and I do
 
01:44:36.030 --> 01:44:36.040 align:start position:0%
have an amendment Mr chairman if I could
 
01:44:37.709 --> 01:44:37.719 align:start position:0%
introduce that to the committee yep
 
01:44:40.709 --> 01:44:40.719 align:start position:0%
that's permissible uh it's uh it's going
 
01:44:41.950 --> 01:44:41.960 align:start position:0%
to be uh
 
01:44:41.960 --> 01:44:44.790 align:start position:0%
to be uh
2025

01:44:44.790 --> 01:44:44.800 align:start position:0%
2025
 
01:44:51.589 --> 01:44:51.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:53.430 --> 01:44:53.440 align:start position:0%
members and if it's it's got a little
 
01:44:55.430 --> 01:44:55.440 align:start position:0%
ink on it I AP okay let's just let's
 
01:44:57.149 --> 01:44:57.159 align:start position:0%
have you discuss the amendment first cuz
 
01:44:58.470 --> 01:44:58.480 align:start position:0%
um they're not going to be able to read
 
01:44:59.430 --> 01:44:59.440 align:start position:0%
it and listen to at the same time
 
01:45:01.709 --> 01:45:01.719 align:start position:0%
anyways so it's very it's very brief
 
01:45:03.589 --> 01:45:03.599 align:start position:0%
okay uh yeah just go ahead and do the
 
01:45:04.830 --> 01:45:04.840 align:start position:0%
testimony for it first in the interest
 
01:45:06.550 --> 01:45:06.560 align:start position:0%
of time if you don't mind and then uh
 
01:45:08.430 --> 01:45:08.440 align:start position:0%
we'll distribute it or the secretary can
 
01:45:10.430 --> 01:45:10.440 align:start position:0%
hand it out yeah I don't repres I don't
 
01:45:12.109 --> 01:45:12.119 align:start position:0%
like distribution of materials in in
 
01:45:12.119 --> 01:45:14.470 align:start position:0%
like distribution of materials in in
hearings

01:45:14.470 --> 01:45:14.480 align:start position:0%
hearings
 
01:45:34.350 --> 01:45:34.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:37.470 --> 01:45:37.480 align:start position:0%
so in in producing the original bill I
 
01:45:40.189 --> 01:45:40.199 align:start position:0%
tried to mirror the statute that deals
 
01:45:42.950 --> 01:45:42.960 align:start position:0%
with the Senate primaries uh because
 
01:45:44.270 --> 01:45:44.280 align:start position:0%
there was a from what I understand a
 
01:45:47.390 --> 01:45:47.400 align:start position:0%
lawsuit years ago that forced the law to
 
01:45:50.910 --> 01:45:50.920 align:start position:0%
be changed because there were uh members
 
01:45:53.990 --> 01:45:54.000 align:start position:0%
or member towns rather that were uh
 
01:45:56.589 --> 01:45:56.599 align:start position:0%
important in the primary for the Senate
 
01:45:59.390 --> 01:45:59.400 align:start position:0%
um and at that point in time um Senator
 
01:46:03.109 --> 01:46:03.119 align:start position:0%
scandin Senator I give you a demotion uh
 
01:46:06.550 --> 01:46:06.560 align:start position:0%
secretary scandin um had said let me let
 
01:46:08.149 --> 01:46:08.159 align:start position:0%
me look at it and he did and he made
 
01:46:11.109 --> 01:46:11.119 align:start position:0%
changes and I wasn't going to deny him
 
01:46:15.070 --> 01:46:15.080 align:start position:0%
um and basically it mirrors uh the uh
 
01:46:17.629 --> 01:46:17.639 align:start position:0%
the statue as it pertains to the Senate
 
01:46:18.990 --> 01:46:19.000 align:start position:0%
uh but it spells out a little bit
 
01:46:21.390 --> 01:46:21.400 align:start position:0%
specifically on the you know the numbers
 
01:46:23.070 --> 01:46:23.080 align:start position:0%
and the you know where it seeds the the
 
01:46:24.910 --> 01:46:24.920 align:start position:0%
candidates and and that type of thing
 
01:46:27.470 --> 01:46:27.480 align:start position:0%
and and I may defer to him because it's
 
01:46:29.790 --> 01:46:29.800 align:start position:0%
more his language than mine but the
 
01:46:32.589 --> 01:46:32.599 align:start position:0%
point was is I'm trying to make it so
 
01:46:36.830 --> 01:46:36.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:39.390 --> 01:46:39.400 align:start position:0%
primary Mr chairman should I stop my
 
01:46:42.310 --> 01:46:42.320 align:start position:0%
testimony or please continue all right
 
01:46:44.550 --> 01:46:44.560 align:start position:0%
um so what I'm trying to do is make sure
 
01:46:46.870 --> 01:46:46.880 align:start position:0%
it doesn't happen to somebody else
 
01:46:48.510 --> 01:46:48.520 align:start position:0%
regardless of the party whether it's
 
01:46:51.709 --> 01:46:51.719 align:start position:0%
Republican or Democrat is that um when
 
01:46:54.470 --> 01:46:54.480 align:start position:0%
you get far down in the ballot you know
 
01:46:56.910 --> 01:46:56.920 align:start position:0%
the position of the name is almost as
 
01:46:59.390 --> 01:46:59.400 align:start position:0%
important as your background and I'll
 
01:47:01.950 --> 01:47:01.960 align:start position:0%
leave the the the the the merits of the
 
01:47:03.790 --> 01:47:03.800 align:start position:0%
the amendment possibly to secretary
 
01:47:06.470 --> 01:47:06.480 align:start position:0%
scandin if that's okay do you want to
 
01:47:09.430 --> 01:47:09.440 align:start position:0%
take questions I always am available for
 
01:47:11.830 --> 01:47:11.840 align:start position:0%
questions other questions from the
 
01:47:14.510 --> 01:47:14.520 align:start position:0%
committee see none thank you secretary
 
01:47:31.589 --> 01:47:31.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:32.990 --> 01:47:33.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman members of the
 
01:47:35.149 --> 01:47:35.159 align:start position:0%
committee I'm David scanland Secretary
 
01:47:38.550 --> 01:47:38.560 align:start position:0%
of State uh and I just I want to comment
 
01:47:41.669 --> 01:47:41.679 align:start position:0%
on the the rotation that is called for
 
01:47:44.030 --> 01:47:44.040 align:start position:0%
in let's just start with House Bill 30
 
01:47:45.510 --> 01:47:45.520 align:start position:0%
as it was
 
01:47:48.189 --> 01:47:48.199 align:start position:0%
introduced right now in New
 
01:47:51.589 --> 01:47:51.599 align:start position:0%
Hampshire every polling place every
 
01:47:54.589 --> 01:47:54.599 align:start position:0%
every town that's a polling place and
 
01:47:57.790 --> 01:47:57.800 align:start position:0%
every city Ward that is a polling place
 
01:47:58.990 --> 01:47:59.000 align:start position:0%
doesn't matter whether they have
 
01:48:02.350 --> 01:48:02.360 align:start position:0%
additional polling places in those uh
 
01:48:06.149 --> 01:48:06.159 align:start position:0%
you know in a town or a ward every town
 
01:48:10.350 --> 01:48:10.360 align:start position:0%
or city ward has its own unique
 
01:48:13.030 --> 01:48:13.040 align:start position:0%
ballot and it is the same for every
 
01:48:16.510 --> 01:48:16.520 align:start position:0%
voter that participates in the election
 
01:48:21.270 --> 01:48:21.280 align:start position:0%
in that polling place so what
 
01:48:26.669 --> 01:48:26.679 align:start position:0%
um house 130 as introduced does would
 
01:48:30.430 --> 01:48:30.440 align:start position:0%
require a further rotation of candidates
 
01:48:33.629 --> 01:48:33.639 align:start position:0%
names within that polling place which
 
01:48:36.229 --> 01:48:36.239 align:start position:0%
means that we would have to print
 
01:48:39.430 --> 01:48:39.440 align:start position:0%
multiple ballots with different name
 
01:48:42.109 --> 01:48:42.119 align:start position:0%
configurations to be used within that
 
01:48:44.870 --> 01:48:44.880 align:start position:0%
polling place which would create a
 
01:48:49.950 --> 01:48:49.960 align:start position:0%
nightmare for everybody because um of
 
01:48:51.550 --> 01:48:51.560 align:start position:0%
the counting process whether it's done
 
01:48:53.870 --> 01:48:53.880 align:start position:0%
by a machine or whether counting teams
 
01:48:56.109 --> 01:48:56.119 align:start position:0%
are counting the ballots because there
 
01:48:58.510 --> 01:48:58.520 align:start position:0%
would be different name configurations
 
01:49:01.270 --> 01:49:01.280 align:start position:0%
it would make it a very difficult
 
01:49:04.629 --> 01:49:04.639 align:start position:0%
task so when I saw that uh on the bill
 
01:49:07.910 --> 01:49:07.920 align:start position:0%
that representative Flanigan uh
 
01:49:10.310 --> 01:49:10.320 align:start position:0%
introduced I suggested to
 
01:49:16.229 --> 01:49:16.239 align:start position:0%
him uh a rotation scheme that would
 
01:49:19.550 --> 01:49:19.560 align:start position:0%
work and Main and it would maintain the
 
01:49:22.709 --> 01:49:22.719 align:start position:0%
individual single ballot used for a
 
01:49:22.719 --> 01:49:24.709 align:start position:0%
individual single ballot used for a
polling

01:49:24.709 --> 01:49:24.719 align:start position:0%
polling
 
01:49:30.109 --> 01:49:30.119 align:start position:0%
place what this calls for is that in a
 
01:49:34.109 --> 01:49:34.119 align:start position:0%
multi- town state representative
 
01:49:36.870 --> 01:49:36.880 align:start position:0%
district there would be a rotation
 
01:49:43.189 --> 01:49:43.199 align:start position:0%
process where right now uh um we have to
 
01:49:45.390 --> 01:49:45.400 align:start position:0%
rotate the order of names on the ballot
 
01:49:48.270 --> 01:49:48.280 align:start position:0%
to make sure that that process is fair
 
01:49:50.310 --> 01:49:50.320 align:start position:0%
uh that was ordered by a court some
 
01:49:53.109 --> 01:49:53.119 align:start position:0%
years ago so we have a seating process
 
01:49:55.550 --> 01:49:55.560 align:start position:0%
where a name is randomly chosen of a
 
01:49:57.870 --> 01:49:57.880 align:start position:0%
candidate that will go first second
 
01:50:01.510 --> 01:50:01.520 align:start position:0%
third all the way down this would allow
 
01:50:04.390 --> 01:50:04.400 align:start position:0%
the first seed to be listed in the
 
01:50:06.910 --> 01:50:06.920 align:start position:0%
largest town in the
 
01:50:09.070 --> 01:50:09.080 align:start position:0%
district and if it's a multi-member
 
01:50:10.350 --> 01:50:10.360 align:start position:0%
multi- toown
 
01:50:13.070 --> 01:50:13.080 align:start position:0%
district number two seed would go in the
 
01:50:15.149 --> 01:50:15.159 align:start position:0%
second largest town if there's a three
 
01:50:18.070 --> 01:50:18.080 align:start position:0%
seed it would go in the third largest
 
01:50:20.990 --> 01:50:21.000 align:start position:0%
town and then when you run out of
 
01:50:23.470 --> 01:50:23.480 align:start position:0%
candidates and there are still more
 
01:50:26.790 --> 01:50:26.800 align:start position:0%
towns that order would reverse to try
 
01:50:29.350 --> 01:50:29.360 align:start position:0%
and balance out the population within
 
01:50:32.870 --> 01:50:32.880 align:start position:0%
that District so this is a rotation
 
01:50:36.990 --> 01:50:37.000 align:start position:0%
scheme that would work for state
 
01:50:39.470 --> 01:50:39.480 align:start position:0%
representative the only caution I have
 
01:50:41.910 --> 01:50:41.920 align:start position:0%
with this is that right now we have a
 
01:50:44.910 --> 01:50:44.920 align:start position:0%
very complex ballot because we have
 
01:50:48.030 --> 01:50:48.040 align:start position:0%
rotation schemes for every office on the
 
01:50:50.870 --> 01:50:50.880 align:start position:0%
ballot it is different for state
 
01:50:52.790 --> 01:50:52.800 align:start position:0%
representative and for state
 
01:50:54.870 --> 01:50:54.880 align:start position:0%
representative we also have a further
 
01:50:57.229 --> 01:50:57.239 align:start position:0%
staggering on the ballot so the names
 
01:51:00.790 --> 01:51:00.800 align:start position:0%
don't line up on a horizontal line to
 
01:51:02.390 --> 01:51:02.400 align:start position:0%
make it look like the horizontal lines
 
01:51:05.270 --> 01:51:05.280 align:start position:0%
aren't running against each
 
01:51:09.830 --> 01:51:09.840 align:start position:0%
other and this would require further
 
01:51:12.990 --> 01:51:13.000 align:start position:0%
rotations and every time you add more
 
01:51:15.990 --> 01:51:16.000 align:start position:0%
rotations it does create the opportunity
 
01:51:18.390 --> 01:51:18.400 align:start position:0%
for mistakes on the ballot which is
 
01:51:22.109 --> 01:51:22.119 align:start position:0%
something that we fear and dread and and
 
01:51:24.870 --> 01:51:24.880 align:start position:0%
take every precaution um to make sure
 
01:51:28.669 --> 01:51:28.679 align:start position:0%
that doesn't happen but um but it is a
 
01:51:31.229 --> 01:51:31.239 align:start position:0%
concern so bottom line is the language
 
01:51:33.669 --> 01:51:33.679 align:start position:0%
in this amendment I think would work for
 
01:51:36.030 --> 01:51:36.040 align:start position:0%
further rotations for state
 
01:51:38.870 --> 01:51:38.880 align:start position:0%
representative on a state primary ballot
 
01:51:41.669 --> 01:51:41.679 align:start position:0%
uh but it does not come without the
 
01:51:43.790 --> 01:51:43.800 align:start position:0%
complexities and the and the additional
 
01:51:45.950 --> 01:51:45.960 align:start position:0%
proofing that will be required to make
 
01:51:47.750 --> 01:51:47.760 align:start position:0%
that happen so with that I would be
 
01:51:49.550 --> 01:51:49.560 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any
 
01:51:52.550 --> 01:51:52.560 align:start position:0%
questions representative we uh thank
 
01:51:53.950 --> 01:51:53.960 align:start position:0%
than Mr chair and thank you secretary
 
01:51:55.629 --> 01:51:55.639 align:start position:0%
scanon for taking my question just on
 
01:51:59.189 --> 01:51:59.199 align:start position:0%
line 12 should that be with uh followed
 
01:52:03.430 --> 01:52:03.440 align:start position:0%
by the next to last seed it seem I'm I'm
 
01:52:06.149 --> 01:52:06.159 align:start position:0%
I think that might be a error a is that
 
01:52:07.790 --> 01:52:07.800 align:start position:0%
an error or am I reading that
 
01:52:08.910 --> 01:52:08.920 align:start position:0%
incorrectly just tell me which line
 
01:52:12.510 --> 01:52:12.520 align:start position:0%
you're on yeah so in 11 to 12 of the
 
01:52:15.069 --> 01:52:15.079 align:start position:0%
amendment when it goes in continue in
 
01:52:17.189 --> 01:52:17.199 align:start position:0%
sequence with the last seed followed by
 
01:52:20.310 --> 01:52:20.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:22.990 --> 01:52:23.000 align:start position:0%
seed and continuing in reverse order
 
01:52:25.910 --> 01:52:25.920 align:start position:0%
until the number of towns is exhausted I
 
01:52:27.750 --> 01:52:27.760 align:start position:0%
should that say instead something like
 
01:52:29.589 --> 01:52:29.599 align:start position:0%
the with the last seed followed by the
 
01:52:31.790 --> 01:52:31.800 align:start position:0%
next to last seed and continuing in
 
01:52:33.589 --> 01:52:33.599 align:start position:0%
reverse order until the number of towns
 
01:52:35.550 --> 01:52:35.560 align:start position:0%
is exhausted I believe you're right yes
 
01:52:37.310 --> 01:52:37.320 align:start position:0%
okay otherwise it reads like a Groucho
 
01:52:40.589 --> 01:52:40.599 align:start position:0%
marks uh yes yeah good catch
 
01:52:43.870 --> 01:52:43.880 align:start position:0%
so further questions represent
 
01:52:45.990 --> 01:52:46.000 align:start position:0%
scene thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
01:52:48.149 --> 01:52:48.159 align:start position:0%
secretary for taking my question uh do
 
01:52:50.390 --> 01:52:50.400 align:start position:0%
you know how many uh multi- toown
 
01:52:52.189 --> 01:52:52.199 align:start position:0%
districts or multi- Ward districts there
 
01:52:55.589 --> 01:52:55.599 align:start position:0%
are that would be affected by
 
01:52:58.470 --> 01:52:58.480 align:start position:0%
this I don't I can try and figure that
 
01:53:01.629 --> 01:53:01.639 align:start position:0%
out for you I don't have a number um you
 
01:53:04.189 --> 01:53:04.199 align:start position:0%
know I will add that you know there
 
01:53:07.709 --> 01:53:07.719 align:start position:0%
there are many singl Town multi-member
 
01:53:10.629 --> 01:53:10.639 align:start position:0%
districts and this legislation obviously
 
01:53:13.510 --> 01:53:13.520 align:start position:0%
would not impact
 
01:53:15.790 --> 01:53:15.800 align:start position:0%
those representative
 
01:53:18.510 --> 01:53:18.520 align:start position:0%
toner thank you is this going to C what
 
01:53:20.430 --> 01:53:20.440 align:start position:0%
is your estimation on what is it going
 
01:53:23.790 --> 01:53:23.800 align:start position:0%
to cause your office to do this
 
01:53:25.910 --> 01:53:25.920 align:start position:0%
just a little more manpower you know the
 
01:53:28.790 --> 01:53:28.800 align:start position:0%
proofing we spend a lot of time proofing
 
01:53:31.069 --> 01:53:31.079 align:start position:0%
the ballots to make sure that they're
 
01:53:34.990 --> 01:53:35.000 align:start position:0%
correct before they go to press and
 
01:53:36.830 --> 01:53:36.840 align:start position:0%
occasionally we don't catch everything
 
01:53:39.430 --> 01:53:39.440 align:start position:0%
and we have to do a reprint of a ballot
 
01:53:42.470 --> 01:53:42.480 align:start position:0%
when you know a mistake is found but uh
 
01:53:44.830 --> 01:53:44.840 align:start position:0%
this will add additional proofing time
 
01:53:46.990 --> 01:53:47.000 align:start position:0%
that'll be required in the ballot
 
01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:49.030 align:start position:0%
that'll be required in the ballot
production

01:53:49.030 --> 01:53:49.040 align:start position:0%
production
 
01:53:50.910 --> 01:53:50.920 align:start position:0%
process further
 
01:53:53.030 --> 01:53:53.040 align:start position:0%
questions seeing nothing thank you I
 
01:53:55.069 --> 01:53:55.079 align:start position:0%
don't have any pink more pink
 
01:53:59.950 --> 01:53:59.960 align:start position:0%
cards um so online we had see if the
 
01:54:04.030 --> 01:54:04.040 align:start position:0%
floor people made a return they did um
 
01:54:06.030 --> 01:54:06.040 align:start position:0%
seven in support 15 opposed one neutral
 
01:54:07.189 --> 01:54:07.199 align:start position:0%
with that I'm going to close the public
 
01:54:10.510 --> 01:54:10.520 align:start position:0%
hearing for House Bill 1:30 uh we'll go

at St A's that was held last June

single ballot primary which is what this

support among the delegates to this New
 
03:04:52.830 --> 03:04:52.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um citizens assembly I'll let
 
03:04:54.550 --> 03:04:54.560 align:start position:0%
some of the participants to that say
 
03:04:56.750 --> 03:04:56.760 align:start position:0%
more about that in a second the idea is
 
03:04:59.990 --> 03:05:00.000 align:start position:0%
very simple that instead of having
 
03:05:02.830 --> 03:05:02.840 align:start position:0%
ballots at primary on primary days where
 
03:05:06.309 --> 03:05:06.319 align:start position:0%
you can only vote for Republicans or
 
03:05:08.229 --> 03:05:08.239 align:start position:0%
only vote for
 
03:05:10.389 --> 03:05:10.399 align:start position:0%
Democrats all the candidates would be on
 
03:05:10.399 --> 03:05:11.150 align:start position:0%
Democrats all the candidates would be on
one

03:05:11.150 --> 03:05:11.160 align:start position:0%
one
 
03:05:13.710 --> 03:05:13.720 align:start position:0%
ballot and every voter would have the
 
03:05:15.670 --> 03:05:15.680 align:start position:0%
opportunity to vote for any candidate a
 
03:05:18.750 --> 03:05:18.760 align:start position:0%
voter could vote for a Democratic
 
03:05:20.429 --> 03:05:20.439 align:start position:0%
candidate for governor could vote for a
 
03:05:23.670 --> 03:05:23.680 align:start position:0%
republican candidate um for the
 
03:05:26.070 --> 03:05:26.080 align:start position:0%
executive counsel Republican candidate
 
03:05:27.670 --> 03:05:27.680 align:start position:0%
or maybe even an Undeclared candidate
 
03:05:31.710 --> 03:05:31.720 align:start position:0%
independent candidate um for the house
 
03:05:33.550 --> 03:05:33.560 align:start position:0%
so they could pick the best candidates
 
03:05:35.830 --> 03:05:35.840 align:start position:0%
regardless of what parties those
 
03:05:39.190 --> 03:05:39.200 align:start position:0%
candidates identified with and the two
 
03:05:41.469 --> 03:05:41.479 align:start position:0%
top vote getting candidates would go on
 
03:05:44.590 --> 03:05:44.600 align:start position:0%
to the general election in a district
 
03:05:46.910 --> 03:05:46.920 align:start position:0%
where there's one seat that's the idea
 
03:05:48.710 --> 03:05:48.720 align:start position:0%
it's very simple some people call it a
 
03:05:50.830 --> 03:05:50.840 align:start position:0%
blanket primary some people refer to it
 
03:05:52.870 --> 03:05:52.880 align:start position:0%
as the Alaska model because it's used in
 
03:05:55.389 --> 03:05:55.399 align:start position:0%
Alaska and some might call it a
 
03:05:57.990 --> 03:05:58.000 align:start position:0%
non-partisan primary um and the
 
03:06:00.510 --> 03:06:00.520 align:start position:0%
principle behind it is that when
 
03:06:03.389 --> 03:06:03.399 align:start position:0%
taxpayers pay for elections and the
 
03:06:06.790 --> 03:06:06.800 align:start position:0%
state administers elections then every
 
03:06:08.910 --> 03:06:08.920 align:start position:0%
citizen should be able to vote for any
 
03:06:11.429 --> 03:06:11.439 align:start position:0%
candidate who's in that
 
03:06:13.550 --> 03:06:13.560 align:start position:0%
election right now the state's paying
 
03:06:16.830 --> 03:06:16.840 align:start position:0%
for and administrating party selection a
 
03:06:19.550 --> 03:06:19.560 align:start position:0%
party selection process for the parties
 
03:06:23.150 --> 03:06:23.160 align:start position:0%
it's a huge subsidy to the parties and
 
03:06:25.389 --> 03:06:25.399 align:start position:0%
voters have to compress themselves into
 
03:06:26.469 --> 03:06:26.479 align:start position:0%
one of the parties in order to
 
03:06:29.349 --> 03:06:29.359 align:start position:0%
participate on primary day as you well
 
03:06:32.309 --> 03:06:32.319 align:start position:0%
know 40% of New Hampshire rights do not
 
03:06:34.670 --> 03:06:34.680 align:start position:0%
identify with a party and for those
 
03:06:35.870 --> 03:06:35.880 align:start position:0%
people they have to say at least for
 
03:06:37.190 --> 03:06:37.200 align:start position:0%
that moment they're voting well I'm a
 
03:06:39.389 --> 03:06:39.399 align:start position:0%
partisan in order to participate in the
 
03:06:41.870 --> 03:06:41.880 align:start position:0%
primary um and there's of course a huge
 
03:06:44.070 --> 03:06:44.080 align:start position:0%
disconnect not just in New Hampshire but
 
03:06:45.790 --> 03:06:45.800 align:start position:0%
more so I'd say really in the country
 
03:06:48.510 --> 03:06:48.520 align:start position:0%
between citizens and the people who
 
03:06:50.349 --> 03:06:50.359 align:start position:0%
represent them in legislatures which is
 
03:06:52.710 --> 03:06:52.720 align:start position:0%
why public opinion of legislates which
 
03:06:54.269 --> 03:06:54.279 align:start position:0%
should be the most esteemed and most
 
03:06:57.469 --> 03:06:57.479 align:start position:0%
powerful branches article one is the
 
03:06:59.389 --> 03:06:59.399 align:start position:0%
legislature should be the most esteemed
 
03:07:00.790 --> 03:07:00.800 align:start position:0%
and Powerful branches in in
 
03:07:03.030 --> 03:07:03.040 align:start position:0%
constitutional democracy are the most
 
03:07:05.030 --> 03:07:05.040 align:start position:0%
despised branches of part of
 
03:07:08.269 --> 03:07:08.279 align:start position:0%
constitutional democracy today um and
 
03:07:10.349 --> 03:07:10.359 align:start position:0%
and you look at New Hampshire 40% of the
 
03:07:11.950 --> 03:07:11.960 align:start position:0%
state you know 40% of the citizens
 
03:07:14.590 --> 03:07:14.600 align:start position:0%
refuse to identify a party um how many
 
03:07:16.110 --> 03:07:16.120 align:start position:0%
independent Undeclared people are there
 
03:07:17.750 --> 03:07:17.760 align:start position:0%
in our legislature in the house the New
 
03:07:20.429 --> 03:07:20.439 align:start position:0%
Hampshire senate about 0% so the
 
03:07:21.950 --> 03:07:21.960 align:start position:0%
disconnect is pretty
 
03:07:25.750 --> 03:07:25.760 align:start position:0%
obvious this single ballot primary would
 
03:07:27.670 --> 03:07:27.680 align:start position:0%
aim to strengthen the connection between
 
03:07:29.950 --> 03:07:29.960 align:start position:0%
representatives and
 
03:07:34.030 --> 03:07:34.040 align:start position:0%
citizens um some object that it's unfair
 
03:07:35.750 --> 03:07:35.760 align:start position:0%
for people who don't strongly identify
 
03:07:37.830 --> 03:07:37.840 align:start position:0%
with the party to select the party
 
03:07:39.389 --> 03:07:39.399 align:start position:0%
nominees that go forward into the
 
03:07:42.030 --> 03:07:42.040 align:start position:0%
general election and well if that were
 
03:07:43.670 --> 03:07:43.680 align:start position:0%
true we wouldn't allow Undeclared voters
 
03:07:46.349 --> 03:07:46.359 align:start position:0%
to participate in primaries and parties
 
03:07:48.389 --> 03:07:48.399 align:start position:0%
have the option of having party caucuses
 
03:07:50.150 --> 03:07:50.160 align:start position:0%
or party conventions they could select
 
03:07:51.910 --> 03:07:51.920 align:start position:0%
their general election candidates the
 
03:07:54.510 --> 03:07:54.520 align:start position:0%
way they select their state party chairs
 
03:07:57.030 --> 03:07:57.040 align:start position:0%
but if they want to engage the common
 
03:07:59.710 --> 03:07:59.720 align:start position:0%
sense of the broad citizenry through an
 
03:08:01.990 --> 03:08:02.000 align:start position:0%
election that's run by the state then
 
03:08:04.190 --> 03:08:04.200 align:start position:0%
they should allow every citizen to vote
 
03:08:07.630 --> 03:08:07.640 align:start position:0%
for any candidate others object that
 
03:08:09.229 --> 03:08:09.239 align:start position:0%
this would invite what's called
 
03:08:11.750 --> 03:08:11.760 align:start position:0%
insincere voting or strategic voting
 
03:08:14.309 --> 03:08:14.319 align:start position:0%
where say imagine you know I I as a
 
03:08:17.670 --> 03:08:17.680 align:start position:0%
loyal Democrat um am in an election
 
03:08:19.550 --> 03:08:19.560 align:start position:0%
where I can vote to select you know the
 
03:08:21.670 --> 03:08:21.680 align:start position:0%
Republican nominee I might vote for what
 
03:08:24.309 --> 03:08:24.319 align:start position:0%
I think is the weakest or most obnoxious
 
03:08:26.389 --> 03:08:26.399 align:start position:0%
nominee thinking that they won't do very
 
03:08:27.950 --> 03:08:27.960 align:start position:0%
well in the general election so it's I
 
03:08:29.830 --> 03:08:29.840 align:start position:0%
vote for someone I don't like in order
 
03:08:31.630 --> 03:08:31.640 align:start position:0%
to saddle my opposition party with a
 
03:08:35.030 --> 03:08:35.040 align:start position:0%
weak candidate well this ballot the
 
03:08:36.670 --> 03:08:36.680 align:start position:0%
single ballot primary would actually
 
03:08:39.389 --> 03:08:39.399 align:start position:0%
eliminate strategic voting it would
 
03:08:41.590 --> 03:08:41.600 align:start position:0%
eliminate it because every P you can
 
03:08:42.910 --> 03:08:42.920 align:start position:0%
only do that when you're sure the
 
03:08:44.630 --> 03:08:44.640 align:start position:0%
candidate you most prefer is going to go
 
03:08:46.790 --> 03:08:46.800 align:start position:0%
forward into the general election like
 
03:08:48.349 --> 03:08:48.359 align:start position:0%
when when on your side there's an
 
03:08:49.790 --> 03:08:49.800 align:start position:0%
incumbent who's unchallenged or
 
03:08:51.229 --> 03:08:51.239 align:start position:0%
something like that then you might I
 
03:08:52.750 --> 03:08:52.760 align:start position:0%
don't know if you're really clever and
 
03:08:54.910 --> 03:08:54.920 align:start position:0%
extremely cynical you know register with
 
03:08:57.110 --> 03:08:57.120 align:start position:0%
the opposition party so you can cast an
 
03:09:00.349 --> 03:09:00.359 align:start position:0%
insincere ballot it doesn't happen much
 
03:09:02.469 --> 03:09:02.479 align:start position:0%
um it really it's only kind of the
 
03:09:05.030 --> 03:09:05.040 align:start position:0%
political science geek club that does
 
03:09:06.910 --> 03:09:06.920 align:start position:0%
this kind of strategic voting most
 
03:09:09.269 --> 03:09:09.279 align:start position:0%
voters are are in fact sincere and vote
 
03:09:12.309 --> 03:09:12.319 align:start position:0%
with Integrity but this this reform
 
03:09:14.229 --> 03:09:14.239 align:start position:0%
would actually eliminate that by making
 
03:09:16.630 --> 03:09:16.640 align:start position:0%
every primary contest a competitive
 
03:09:16.640 --> 03:09:17.870 align:start position:0%
every primary contest a competitive
primary

03:09:17.870 --> 03:09:17.880 align:start position:0%
primary
 
03:09:19.389 --> 03:09:19.399 align:start position:0%
you can never be certain that your
 
03:09:21.790 --> 03:09:21.800 align:start position:0%
preferred candidate has is a shoe in and
 
03:09:23.710 --> 03:09:23.720 align:start position:0%
it's going to go on to the general
 
03:09:23.720 --> 03:09:25.150 align:start position:0%
it's going to go on to the general
election

03:09:25.150 --> 03:09:25.160 align:start position:0%
election
 
03:09:27.710 --> 03:09:27.720 align:start position:0%
so I think that by making primary
 
03:09:30.229 --> 03:09:30.239 align:start position:0%
elections more compelling turnout will
 
03:09:32.389 --> 03:09:32.399 align:start position:0%
increase and the common sense of the
 
03:09:34.510 --> 03:09:34.520 align:start position:0%
citizenry will be brought to bear with
 
03:09:37.750 --> 03:09:37.760 align:start position:0%
more effect on our elections and I think
 
03:09:40.309 --> 03:09:40.319 align:start position:0%
that would be alog together salutary and
 
03:09:43.150 --> 03:09:43.160 align:start position:0%
so that's why I I I viewed the request
 
03:09:45.309 --> 03:09:45.319 align:start position:0%
from from from some constituents from
 
03:09:47.030 --> 03:09:47.040 align:start position:0%

03:09:49.550 --> 03:09:49.560 align:start position:0%

ground and to seek workable Solutions
 
03:10:58.710 --> 03:10:58.720 align:start position:0%
which then can be put into
 
03:11:02.349 --> 03:11:02.359 align:start position:0%
action during the fall winter and spring
 
03:11:02.359 --> 03:11:03.349 align:start position:0%
action during the fall winter and spring
of

03:11:03.349 --> 03:11:03.359 align:start position:0%
of
 
03:11:05.790 --> 03:11:05.800 align:start position:0%
2324 we held listening sessions
 
03:11:08.870 --> 03:11:08.880 align:start position:0%
throughout the state in every County to
 
03:11:11.710 --> 03:11:11.720 align:start position:0%
hear our citizens concerns and to make
 
03:11:13.990 --> 03:11:14.000 align:start position:0%
sure that we were hitting all the
 
03:11:16.990 --> 03:11:17.000 align:start position:0%
demographics we um commissioned a poll
 
03:11:18.110 --> 03:11:18.120 align:start position:0%
for from
 
03:11:21.269 --> 03:11:21.279 align:start position:0%
UNH there were many issues that Rose to
 
03:11:23.790 --> 03:11:23.800 align:start position:0%
the four of that poll and I know you
 
03:11:25.510 --> 03:11:25.520 align:start position:0%
know some of them the cost of living
 
03:11:28.510 --> 03:11:28.520 align:start position:0%
housing Child Care those were all there
 
03:11:31.469 --> 03:11:31.479 align:start position:0%
but what surprised us was rising to the
 
03:11:36.269 --> 03:11:36.279 align:start position:0%
very top was were three major themes
 
03:11:38.510 --> 03:11:38.520 align:start position:0%
political polarization and how it was
 
03:11:38.520 --> 03:11:39.790 align:start position:0%
political polarization and how it was
dividing

03:11:39.790 --> 03:11:39.800 align:start position:0%
dividing
 
03:11:42.670 --> 03:11:42.680 align:start position:0%
us confidence in our elections and how
 
03:11:45.190 --> 03:11:45.200 align:start position:0%
we needed to improve
 
03:11:48.429 --> 03:11:48.439 align:start position:0%
that and the lack of Representatives
 
03:11:50.590 --> 03:11:50.600 align:start position:0%
representation and respons
 
03:11:53.190 --> 03:11:53.200 align:start position:0%
responsiveness of government to the
 
03:11:56.030 --> 03:11:56.040 align:start position:0%
people that they
 
03:11:58.870 --> 03:11:58.880 align:start position:0%
represent over a three-day weekend in
 
03:12:01.590 --> 03:12:01.600 align:start position:0%
June New Hampshire together held its
 
03:12:03.990 --> 03:12:04.000 align:start position:0%
first the first ever in the United
 
03:12:07.190 --> 03:12:07.200 align:start position:0%
States Statewide citizens assembly at St
 
03:12:09.790 --> 03:12:09.800 align:start position:0%
A's and representative Mirad mentioned
 
03:12:11.830 --> 03:12:11.840 align:start position:0%
it I'll give you a little bit more
 
03:12:15.429 --> 03:12:15.439 align:start position:0%
detail they came to address these issues
 
03:12:17.710 --> 03:12:17.720 align:start position:0%
and to find a solution
 
03:12:20.110 --> 03:12:20.120 align:start position:0%
we strove to ensure that the 50
 
03:12:22.229 --> 03:12:22.239 align:start position:0%
delegates who participated were
 
03:12:24.670 --> 03:12:24.680 align:start position:0%
demographically representative of the
 
03:12:27.790 --> 03:12:27.800 align:start position:0%
state as a whole we worked hard to get
 
03:12:30.110 --> 03:12:30.120 align:start position:0%
people from north and south east and
 
03:12:33.190 --> 03:12:33.200 align:start position:0%
west we made sure that the uh CI the
 
03:12:35.590 --> 03:12:35.600 align:start position:0%
delegates were of different political
 
03:12:37.870 --> 03:12:37.880 align:start position:0%
Persuasions and as a matter of fact we
 
03:12:41.150 --> 03:12:41.160 align:start position:0%
had a pretty good match of um and a few
 
03:12:43.309 --> 03:12:43.319 align:start position:0%
outliers we had some green party folks
 
03:12:45.429 --> 03:12:45.439 align:start position:0%
there we had Libertarians we had
 
03:12:47.590 --> 03:12:47.600 align:start position:0%
Democrats we had Republicans we had left
 
03:12:49.190 --> 03:12:49.200 align:start position:0%
leaning Undeclared we had right leaning
 
03:12:51.229 --> 03:12:51.239 align:start position:0%
Undeclared and we had modate Undeclared
 
03:12:52.790 --> 03:12:52.800 align:start position:0%
they were all there together in this
 
03:12:56.510 --> 03:12:56.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:00.990 --> 03:13:01.000 align:start position:0%
A's we made ground rules for respectful
 
03:13:05.710 --> 03:13:05.720 align:start position:0%
dialogue and all had to agree those
 
03:13:09.790 --> 03:13:09.800 align:start position:0%
rules delegates then chose a problem
 
03:13:13.030 --> 03:13:13.040 align:start position:0%
area and they broke into groups and they
 
03:13:15.990 --> 03:13:16.000 align:start position:0%
got down to work to do these four things
 
03:13:18.309 --> 03:13:18.319 align:start position:0%
identify specific specific areas of
 
03:13:22.030 --> 03:13:22.040 align:start position:0%
widespread concern in their chosen topic
 
03:13:23.990 --> 03:13:24.000 align:start position:0%
here different perspectives and that was
 
03:13:26.950 --> 03:13:26.960 align:start position:0%
one of the most important parts evaluate
 
03:13:30.150 --> 03:13:30.160 align:start position:0%
promising Solutions we had um experts
 
03:13:32.309 --> 03:13:32.319 align:start position:0%
there from all over um all different
 
03:13:34.030 --> 03:13:34.040 align:start position:0%
aspects of their their issues that they
 
03:13:37.229 --> 03:13:37.239 align:start position:0%
could listen to and tap into and if the
 
03:13:39.070 --> 03:13:39.080 align:start position:0%
solution that they worked up required
 
03:13:41.830 --> 03:13:41.840 align:start position:0%
legislation to take appropriate steps to
 
03:13:44.550 --> 03:13:44.560 align:start position:0%
make it happen so in order for the
 
03:13:47.150 --> 03:13:47.160 align:start position:0%
group's policy recommendation to become
 
03:13:49.429 --> 03:13:49.439 align:start position:0%
an official recommendation of the first
 
03:13:52.469 --> 03:13:52.479 align:start position:0%
ever citizens assembly it had to meet
 
03:13:54.670 --> 03:13:54.680 align:start position:0%
the very high bar of
 
03:13:57.870 --> 03:13:57.880 align:start position:0%
75% of those in attendance accepting it
 
03:14:02.349 --> 03:14:02.359 align:start position:0%
and approving it and in fact the four
 
03:14:04.389 --> 03:14:04.399 align:start position:0%
proposals that came forward exceeded
 
03:14:06.750 --> 03:14:06.760 align:start position:0%
that they were all in the
 
03:14:09.790 --> 03:14:09.800 align:start position:0%

50 uh volunteer delegates to that um as
 
03:15:49.830 --> 03:15:49.840 align:start position:0%
Dr or Mr mad said before the uh single
 
03:15:51.349 --> 03:15:51.359 align:start position:0%
ballot primary with a single ballot
 
03:15:54.510 --> 03:15:54.520 align:start position:0%
primary the separate Democratic and
 
03:15:57.550 --> 03:15:57.560 align:start position:0%
Republican ballots would be replaced by
 
03:16:00.990 --> 03:16:01.000 align:start position:0%
a single nonpartisan ballot for all
 
03:16:05.030 --> 03:16:05.040 align:start position:0%
Statewide and Congressional um uh
 
03:16:05.040 --> 03:16:06.189 align:start position:0%
Statewide and Congressional um uh
primary

03:16:06.189 --> 03:16:06.199 align:start position:0%
primary
 
03:16:08.830 --> 03:16:08.840 align:start position:0%
elections the single ballot would
 
03:16:11.389 --> 03:16:11.399 align:start position:0%
include all the candidates from all the
 
03:16:14.189 --> 03:16:14.199 align:start position:0%
parties and each candidate would have
 
03:16:18.070 --> 03:16:18.080 align:start position:0%
the option of including their a partisan
 
03:16:21.030 --> 03:16:21.040 align:start position:0%
affiliation by their
 
03:16:23.910 --> 03:16:23.920 align:start position:0%
name the single ballot primary would
 
03:16:28.189 --> 03:16:28.199 align:start position:0%
provide benefits to the voters to the
 
03:16:30.750 --> 03:16:30.760 align:start position:0%
candidates to the elected
 
03:16:33.269 --> 03:16:33.279 align:start position:0%
representatives and to the general
 
03:16:37.349 --> 03:16:37.359 align:start position:0%
public for Undeclared voters the single
 
03:16:40.630 --> 03:16:40.640 align:start position:0%
ballot primary would allow them to or
 
03:16:43.110 --> 03:16:43.120 align:start position:0%
would eliminate the need for them to
 
03:16:46.590 --> 03:16:46.600 align:start position:0%
declare a major party before voting for
 
03:16:51.670 --> 03:16:51.680 align:start position:0%
all all voters it would allow them to
 
03:16:54.389 --> 03:16:54.399 align:start position:0%
vote for any any of the candidates from
 
03:16:55.830 --> 03:16:55.840 align:start position:0%
any of the
 
03:17:00.950 --> 03:17:00.960 align:start position:0%
parties for the um non- major party
 
03:17:03.550 --> 03:17:03.560 align:start position:0%
candidates it would make their filing
 
03:17:06.910 --> 03:17:06.920 align:start position:0%
requirements more fair for the major
 
03:17:10.189 --> 03:17:10.199 align:start position:0%
party candidates it
 
03:17:12.590 --> 03:17:12.600 align:start position:0%
would it would give them it would help
 
03:17:15.429 --> 03:17:15.439 align:start position:0%
them compete against the more partisan
 
03:17:18.950 --> 03:17:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:22.229 --> 03:17:22.239 align:start position:0%
for and the single ballot primary would
 
03:17:25.070 --> 03:17:25.080 align:start position:0%
have the effect of encouraging all the
 
03:17:29.710 --> 03:17:29.720 align:start position:0%
candidates to appeal more broadly to the
 
03:17:33.189 --> 03:17:33.199 align:start position:0%
constituency and to use less
 
03:17:37.710 --> 03:17:37.720 align:start position:0%
inflammatory rhetoric and uh fewer uh
 
03:17:40.229 --> 03:17:40.239 align:start position:0%
false claims Mr Black your time has
 
03:17:42.229 --> 03:17:42.239 align:start position:0%
expired I'm me ask you to bring your um
 
03:17:43.750 --> 03:17:43.760 align:start position:0%
remarks to conclusion so everybody knows
 
03:17:45.670 --> 03:17:45.680 align:start position:0%
we operate on a two-minute public
 
03:17:49.670 --> 03:17:49.680 align:start position:0%
testimony clock and election law okay um
 
03:17:52.309 --> 03:17:52.319 align:start position:0%
so I I'll just finish with the fact that
 
03:17:54.990 --> 03:17:55.000 align:start position:0%
uh even for elected uh
 
03:17:57.550 --> 03:17:57.560 align:start position:0%
Representatives what it would do it
 
03:18:00.990 --> 03:18:01.000 align:start position:0%
would um it would allow them to vote
 
03:18:04.630 --> 03:18:04.640 align:start position:0%
their conscience and to uh represent
 
03:18:07.429 --> 03:18:07.439 align:start position:0%
their constituency without the fear of
 
03:18:10.349 --> 03:18:10.359 align:start position:0%
being primaried from an smaller uh more
 
03:18:12.510 --> 03:18:12.520 align:start position:0%
partisan special interest group or an
 
03:18:14.349 --> 03:18:14.359 align:start position:0%
out ofate special interest group and for
 
03:18:16.870 --> 03:18:16.880 align:start position:0%
the public this is my last sentence for
 
03:18:20.510 --> 03:18:20.520 align:start position:0%
the public it would uh reduce partisan
 
03:18:23.630 --> 03:18:23.640 align:start position:0%
uh polarization and it would improve
 
03:18:23.640 --> 03:18:24.870 align:start position:0%
uh polarization and it would improve
political

03:18:24.870 --> 03:18:24.880 align:start position:0%
political
 
03:18:27.229 --> 03:18:27.239 align:start position:0%
representation and the responsiveness of
 
03:18:27.239 --> 03:18:28.229 align:start position:0%
representation and the responsiveness of
their

03:18:28.229 --> 03:18:28.239 align:start position:0%

worker through several election Cycles
 
03:19:15.189 --> 03:19:15.199 align:start position:0%
it has been my experience that primaries
 
03:19:16.990 --> 03:19:17.000 align:start position:0%
caused frustration among part parts of
 
03:19:19.349 --> 03:19:19.359 align:start position:0%
our electorate I cannot count how many
 
03:19:21.269 --> 03:19:21.279 align:start position:0%

03:19:36.189 --> 03:19:36.199 align:start position:0%
to lead in ensuring the people's vote
 
03:19:37.910 --> 03:19:37.920 align:start position:0%

diverse group of individuals politically
 
03:19:54.830 --> 03:19:54.840 align:start position:0%
far uh from far left to far right
 
03:19:56.229 --> 03:19:56.239 align:start position:0%
everything in between and outside of
 
03:19:58.590 --> 03:19:58.600 align:start position:0%
that spectrum and we were all residents
 
03:20:00.510 --> 03:20:00.520 align:start position:0%
of the state who cared very deeply about
 
03:20:02.389 --> 03:20:02.399 align:start position:0%
the work we were doing through
 
03:20:03.990 --> 03:20:04.000 align:start position:0%
discussion we discovered that we all
 
03:20:06.269 --> 03:20:06.279 align:start position:0%
felt having a single ballot primary
 
03:20:08.269 --> 03:20:08.279 align:start position:0%
would reduce polarization by allowing
 
03:20:10.990 --> 03:20:11.000 align:start position:0%
the majority rather than a minority pick
 
03:20:13.150 --> 03:20:13.160 align:start position:0%
candidates for the general election it
 
03:20:14.870 --> 03:20:14.880 align:start position:0%
was really one of the few Concepts we
 
03:20:16.229 --> 03:20:16.239 align:start position:0%
all agreed on that we felt would
 
03:20:17.710 --> 03:20:17.720 align:start position:0%
actually reduce
 
03:20:19.950 --> 03:20:19.960 align:start position:0%
polarization Manchester and NASA both
 
03:20:22.349 --> 03:20:22.359 align:start position:0%
hold successful single ballot Municipal
 
03:20:25.590 --> 03:20:25.600 align:start position:0%
primaries nonpartisan I have worked the
 
03:20:27.469 --> 03:20:27.479 align:start position:0%
Manchester primary there are less
 
03:20:29.429 --> 03:20:29.439 align:start position:0%
questions and conflicts with the single
 
03:20:31.830 --> 03:20:31.840 align:start position:0%
ballot and no concerns from Undeclared
 
03:20:34.030 --> 03:20:34.040 align:start position:0%
voters about being left out of the
 
03:20:36.349 --> 03:20:36.359 align:start position:0%
process there are four states in the US
 
03:20:37.950 --> 03:20:37.960 align:start position:0%
already doing this and they report it
 
03:20:40.510 --> 03:20:40.520 align:start position:0%
has not favored one party over another
 
03:20:42.870 --> 03:20:42.880 align:start position:0%
this is an impactful tangible way to
 
03:20:44.349 --> 03:20:44.359 align:start position:0%
hear all of New Hampshire's registered
 
03:20:47.429 --> 03:20:47.439 align:start position:0%
voters in the primary process I ask that
 
03:20:49.870 --> 03:20:49.880 align:start position:0%
you please support HB 714 which gives
 
03:20:51.710 --> 03:20:51.720 align:start position:0%
voice to all New Hampshire's registered
 
03:20:53.790 --> 03:20:53.800 align:start position:0%
voters thank you okay will you be taking
 
03:20:56.110 --> 03:20:56.120 align:start position:0%
questions I will if people have them are

there questions from the committee
 
03:20:57.560 --> 03:20:58.710 align:start position:0%
there questions from the committee
representative

03:20:58.710 --> 03:20:58.720 align:start position:0%

03:21:02.429 --> 03:21:02.439 align:start position:0%
other three
 
03:21:07.150 --> 03:21:07.160 align:start position:0%
states oh that is a great question
 
03:21:10.750 --> 03:21:10.760 align:start position:0%
Nebraska Louisiana Washington California
 
03:21:13.870 --> 03:21:13.880 align:start position:0%
it's two blue and two red States yeah
 
03:21:15.469 --> 03:21:15.479 align:start position:0%
representative Lane do you have a
 
03:21:15.479 --> 03:21:17.309 align:start position:0%
representative Lane do you have a
question

03:21:17.309 --> 03:21:17.319 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:21:22.189 --> 03:21:22.199 align:start position:0%
w nine right yes yeah Ross that's right
 
03:21:23.429 --> 03:21:23.439 align:start position:0%
see look at
 
03:21:27.469 --> 03:21:27.479 align:start position:0%
that great memory um next up is uh
 
03:21:29.990 --> 03:21:30.000 align:start position:0%
repere she gets to cut sorry I we let
 
03:21:31.590 --> 03:21:31.600 align:start position:0%
the rep because we're in SE we're in
 
03:21:32.790 --> 03:21:32.800 align:start position:0%
committees so I usually let the
 
03:21:35.830 --> 03:21:35.840 align:start position:0%
representatives cut I apologize that's
 
03:21:41.870 --> 03:21:41.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:44.469 --> 03:21:44.479 align:start position:0%
fairly apologies thank you Mr chair and
 
03:21:47.070 --> 03:21:47.080 align:start position:0%
thank you honorable members um for the
 
03:21:49.309 --> 03:21:49.319 align:start position:0%
record my name is Ellen Reed I represent
 
03:21:50.790 --> 03:21:50.800 align:start position:0%
Rockingham 10 which's new market and new
 
03:21:54.150 --> 03:21:54.160 align:start position:0%
Fields I am in support of the concept of
 
03:21:56.550 --> 03:21:56.560 align:start position:0%
the bill I am a supporter of open
 
03:21:59.750 --> 03:21:59.760 align:start position:0%
primaries however I believe as written
 
03:22:01.349 --> 03:22:01.359 align:start position:0%
and I know that this was worked on by a
 
03:22:04.189 --> 03:22:04.199 align:start position:0%
number of people um as written this
 
03:22:06.469 --> 03:22:06.479 align:start position:0%
could cause more harm than good if the
 
03:22:08.750 --> 03:22:08.760 align:start position:0%
committee is serious about the concept
 
03:22:11.349 --> 03:22:11.359 align:start position:0%
of an Open Primary um you're not going
 
03:22:12.630 --> 03:22:12.640 align:start position:0%
to like what I have to or some of you
 
03:22:14.429 --> 03:22:14.439 align:start position:0%
won't like what I have to say so the
 
03:22:17.469 --> 03:22:17.479 align:start position:0%
problem is the problem that I see
 
03:22:20.429 --> 03:22:20.439 align:start position:0%
is that um what we call single party
 
03:22:23.150 --> 03:22:23.160 align:start position:0%
sweeps so for example we are familiar
 
03:22:24.990 --> 03:22:25.000 align:start position:0%
with uh multi-member districts as state
 
03:22:28.269 --> 03:22:28.279 align:start position:0%
reps and you may have a district that
 
03:22:28.279 --> 03:22:30.229 align:start position:0%
reps and you may have a district that
is

03:22:30.229 --> 03:22:30.239 align:start position:0%
is
 
03:22:34.429 --> 03:22:34.439 align:start position:0%
60% party orange and 40% party
 
03:22:36.990 --> 03:22:37.000 align:start position:0%
purple and you have multiple seats and
 
03:22:39.150 --> 03:22:39.160 align:start position:0%
this is a multi-member district because
 
03:22:40.790 --> 03:22:40.800 align:start position:0%
you have a top two so it's like having a
 
03:22:43.830 --> 03:22:43.840 align:start position:0%
two- member district right even though
 
03:22:45.990 --> 03:22:46.000 align:start position:0%
numerically you might expect a lot of
 
03:22:48.590 --> 03:22:48.600 align:start position:0%
times that to be split one orange
 
03:22:51.950 --> 03:22:51.960 align:start position:0%
representative one purple you often get
 
03:22:55.510 --> 03:22:55.520 align:start position:0%
that 60% determining all the winners so
 
03:22:58.469 --> 03:22:58.479 align:start position:0%
you may for this purpose end up with
 
03:23:01.070 --> 03:23:01.080 align:start position:0%
only one party represented on the
 
03:23:04.389 --> 03:23:04.399 align:start position:0%
general ballot depending even if the
 
03:23:07.830 --> 03:23:07.840 align:start position:0%
even if the votes were only like 55% in
 
03:23:11.870 --> 03:23:11.880 align:start position:0%
favor of one uh party that's 45% of
 
03:23:13.910 --> 03:23:13.920 align:start position:0%
people whose voice isn't being heard for
 
03:23:15.550 --> 03:23:15.560 align:start position:0%
the purposes of candidates on the
 
03:23:18.790 --> 03:23:18.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:20.030 --> 03:23:20.040 align:start position:0%
and I'm sorry if I was drawing an
 
03:23:21.950 --> 03:23:21.960 align:start position:0%
analogy that got confusing I was
 
03:23:25.349 --> 03:23:25.359 align:start position:0%
relating the concept of a primary to the
 
03:23:27.830 --> 03:23:27.840 align:start position:0%
general ballot the way we relate a
 
03:23:29.590 --> 03:23:29.600 align:start position:0%
multi-member district because what you
 
03:23:31.229 --> 03:23:31.239 align:start position:0%
have is when you have top two or top
 
03:23:33.630 --> 03:23:33.640 align:start position:0%
three or top five you essentially are
 
03:23:36.389 --> 03:23:36.399 align:start position:0%
creating a multi-member
 
03:23:39.389 --> 03:23:39.399 align:start position:0%
district the other thing is that we
 
03:23:41.950 --> 03:23:41.960 align:start position:0%
already suffer from a decreased turnout
 
03:23:45.389 --> 03:23:45.399 align:start position:0%
in primaries and what this does is um
 
03:23:48.229 --> 03:23:48.239 align:start position:0%
amplify that problem there is a way to
 
03:23:50.910 --> 03:23:50.920 align:start position:0%
get around that problem and around the
 
03:23:52.110 --> 03:23:52.120 align:start position:0%
problem of having the single party
 
03:23:54.630 --> 03:23:54.640 align:start position:0%
sweeps and that's is to make the results
 
03:23:57.590 --> 03:23:57.600 align:start position:0%
proportional to the votes and this is
 
03:23:59.550 --> 03:23:59.560 align:start position:0%
where I might get push back there is a
 
03:24:01.630 --> 03:24:01.640 align:start position:0%
easy way to get make that proportional
 
03:24:04.389 --> 03:24:04.399 align:start position:0%
and it's called rank Choice voting I
 
03:24:07.910 --> 03:24:07.920 align:start position:0%
promise I am not simply testifying to to
 
03:24:10.469 --> 03:24:10.479 align:start position:0%
talk about rank Choice voting but an
 
03:24:12.670 --> 03:24:12.680 align:start position:0%
Open Primary without rank Choice voting
 
03:24:15.950 --> 03:24:15.960 align:start position:0%
has the potential of uh amplifying the
 
03:24:18.389 --> 03:24:18.399 align:start position:0%
very small voice of people who who turn
 
03:24:19.910 --> 03:24:19.920 align:start position:0%
out to a primary not just the people who
 
03:24:22.229 --> 03:24:22.239 align:start position:0%
turn out to a primary but a narrow
 
03:24:23.630 --> 03:24:23.640 align:start position:0%
majority of people who turn out to the
 
03:24:26.550 --> 03:24:26.560 align:start position:0%
primary are dictating all the people on
 
03:24:28.990 --> 03:24:29.000 align:start position:0%
the general ballot but if you do with
 
03:24:30.349 --> 03:24:30.359 align:start position:0%
with rank Choice voting there's two ways
 
03:24:34.030 --> 03:24:34.040 align:start position:0%
to do it you end up with proportional
 
03:24:36.590 --> 03:24:36.600 align:start position:0%
representation on that General ballot so
 
03:24:40.429 --> 03:24:40.439 align:start position:0%
now you have the 45% or the 35% um
 
03:24:43.309 --> 03:24:43.319 align:start position:0%
getting some uh selection that appeals
 
03:24:45.189 --> 03:24:45.199 align:start position:0%
to them on the general ballot so you can
 
03:24:47.349 --> 03:24:47.359 align:start position:0%
either do single transferable vote which
 
03:24:49.110 --> 03:24:49.120 align:start position:0%
is what rank Choice voting is when it's
 
03:24:50.710 --> 03:24:50.720 align:start position:0%
applied to a multi-member district so if
 
03:24:53.670 --> 03:24:53.680 align:start position:0%
you had like a top four or top five um
 
03:24:55.630 --> 03:24:55.640 align:start position:0%
you could do single transferable Vote or
 
03:24:58.389 --> 03:24:58.399 align:start position:0%
you can simply set a threshold say
 
03:25:00.790 --> 03:25:00.800 align:start position:0%
15% um and any candidate who gets over
 
03:25:02.630 --> 03:25:02.640 align:start position:0%
15% would end up in the ballot so that
 
03:25:04.269 --> 03:25:04.279 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be a top two or top three that
 
03:25:06.670 --> 03:25:06.680 align:start position:0%
would just be whoever gets over 15%
 
03:25:08.950 --> 03:25:08.960 align:start position:0%
which would be between two and like six
 
03:25:10.750 --> 03:25:10.760 align:start position:0%
candidates on the general ballot
 
03:25:11.870 --> 03:25:11.880 align:start position:0%
represent I'm going to ask you to bring
 
03:25:13.469 --> 03:25:13.479 align:start position:0%
your remarks to a conclusion we've gone
 
03:25:15.510 --> 03:25:15.520 align:start position:0%
over all right I'm with that I'm happy
 
03:25:17.910 --> 03:25:17.920 align:start position:0%
to take questions I just I see issues
 
03:25:19.630 --> 03:25:19.640 align:start position:0%
with how it's being proposed to be
 
03:25:23.429 --> 03:25:23.439 align:start position:0%
enacted um I don't like the idea of of
 
03:25:25.229 --> 03:25:25.239 align:start position:0%
having only one party on the general
 
03:25:29.189 --> 03:25:29.199 align:start position:0%
ballot which would become a problem um
 
03:25:30.790 --> 03:25:30.800 align:start position:0%
and but there is a solution and I do
 
03:25:32.830 --> 03:25:32.840 align:start position:0%
support the concept of open
 
03:25:35.670 --> 03:25:35.680 align:start position:0%
primaries questions from the committee
 
03:25:36.870 --> 03:25:36.880 align:start position:0%
seeing Oh representative Grill you've
 
03:25:41.110 --> 03:25:41.120 align:start position:0%
joined us to see you is your car fixed
 
03:25:44.030 --> 03:25:44.040 align:start position:0%
excellent next up is uh Tiani Coleman
 
03:25:53.550 --> 03:25:53.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:56.070 --> 03:25:56.080 align:start position:0%
hello I'm Tiani Coleman and I'm here
 
03:25:58.790 --> 03:25:58.800 align:start position:0%
today in my capacity as myself an
 
03:26:01.750 --> 03:26:01.760 align:start position:0%
independent voter as well as a leader of
 
03:26:03.870 --> 03:26:03.880 align:start position:0%
a non-partisan citizen group called New
 
03:26:06.309 --> 03:26:06.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire independent voters I do other
 
03:26:08.189 --> 03:26:08.199 align:start position:0%
things I'm not here in that capacity
 
03:26:13.110 --> 03:26:13.120 align:start position:0%
today um so I have been a resident of
 
03:26:17.229 --> 03:26:17.239 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire for over 11 years
 
03:26:19.590 --> 03:26:19.600 align:start position:0%
and as an independent voter that entire
 
03:26:22.110 --> 03:26:22.120 align:start position:0%
time I became an independent voter
 
03:26:25.110 --> 03:26:25.120 align:start position:0%
unaffiliated voter about 12 years ago
 
03:26:28.550 --> 03:26:28.560 align:start position:0%
but about 20 years ago uh I was the
 
03:26:31.030 --> 03:26:31.040 align:start position:0%
chair of the largest county in the
 
03:26:33.630 --> 03:26:33.640 align:start position:0%
Republican party chair of the largest
 
03:26:38.229 --> 03:26:38.239 align:start position:0%
county in Utah over a million residents
 
03:26:40.790 --> 03:26:40.800 align:start position:0%
and I worked in the inner Circles of
 
03:26:42.630 --> 03:26:42.640 align:start position:0%
Party politics within that County and
 
03:26:45.590 --> 03:26:45.600 align:start position:0%
within the state and then later I became
 
03:26:47.590 --> 03:26:47.600 align:start position:0%
a campaign caign manager for a US
 
03:26:50.510 --> 03:26:50.520 align:start position:0%
Congressional candidate who was a
 
03:26:53.110 --> 03:26:53.120 align:start position:0%
moderate Democrat running in one of the
 
03:26:55.870 --> 03:26:55.880 align:start position:0%
most conservative counties counties in
 
03:26:59.229 --> 03:26:59.239 align:start position:0%
the state so in th those two experiences
 
03:27:02.990 --> 03:27:03.000 align:start position:0%
I was able to um experience inner Party
 
03:27:06.070 --> 03:27:06.080 align:start position:0%
politics in areas where you didn't have
 
03:27:08.590 --> 03:27:08.600 align:start position:0%
very much power as well as like in the
 
03:27:12.189 --> 03:27:12.199 align:start position:0%
capital city of Salt Lake City proper um
 
03:27:13.950 --> 03:27:13.960 align:start position:0%
Democrats actually had a lot of power
 
03:27:16.510 --> 03:27:16.520 align:start position:0%
but in the state Democrats had no power
 
03:27:18.389 --> 03:27:18.399 align:start position:0%
so I I got to watch a lot of things and
 
03:27:21.030 --> 03:27:21.040 align:start position:0%
I I came to see that corruption does not
 
03:27:23.269 --> 03:27:23.279 align:start position:0%
belong to any party corruption belongs
 
03:27:27.150 --> 03:27:27.160 align:start position:0%
to power and that was when I started
 
03:27:28.710 --> 03:27:28.720 align:start position:0%
thinking what can we do to change the
 
03:27:30.429 --> 03:27:30.439 align:start position:0%
way the electoral system works in the
 
03:27:32.150 --> 03:27:32.160 align:start position:0%
state which was a caucus system and
 
03:27:32.990 --> 03:27:33.000 align:start position:0%
there was a lot of things I'm not going
 
03:27:34.309 --> 03:27:34.319 align:start position:0%
to go into it but I started thinking we
 
03:27:36.830 --> 03:27:36.840 align:start position:0%
really need to make some changes and I
 
03:27:39.349 --> 03:27:39.359 align:start position:0%
I'm also an attorney and I came across
 
03:27:39.359 --> 03:27:40.590 align:start position:0%
I'm also an attorney and I came across
Justice

03:27:40.590 --> 03:27:40.600 align:start position:0%
Justice
 
03:27:43.189 --> 03:27:43.199 align:start position:0%
scalia's a little after 2010 I came
 
03:27:46.950 --> 03:27:46.960 align:start position:0%
across Justice scalia's Artic landmark
 
03:27:50.349 --> 03:27:50.359 align:start position:0%
decision in um
 
03:27:52.710 --> 03:27:52.720 align:start position:0%
California excuse me Democratic party V
 
03:27:55.349 --> 03:27:55.359 align:start position:0%
Jones that came out of California where
 
03:28:00.389 --> 03:28:00.399 align:start position:0%
they decided that a uh that
 
03:28:04.150 --> 03:28:04.160 align:start position:0%
a what was it called a ballot a what's
 
03:28:07.189 --> 03:28:07.199 align:start position:0%
it's called a um blanket primary they
 
03:28:08.910 --> 03:28:08.920 align:start position:0%
decided that a blanket primary was
 
03:28:11.150 --> 03:28:11.160 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional a blanket primary is
 
03:28:13.510 --> 03:28:13.520 align:start position:0%
when you do it single ballot but you're
 
03:28:16.110 --> 03:28:16.120 align:start position:0%
still choosing the party nominees but
 
03:28:18.950 --> 03:28:18.960 align:start position:0%
Justice Scalia had a little sentence in
 
03:28:20.670 --> 03:28:20.680 align:start position:0%
there that really piqu my interest and
 
03:28:23.990 --> 03:28:24.000 align:start position:0%
it was a sentence that said but parties
 
03:28:26.630 --> 03:28:26.640 align:start position:0%
don't have elections primary elections
 
03:28:29.349 --> 03:28:29.359 align:start position:0%
don't have to be by party nominees you
 
03:28:30.710 --> 03:28:30.720 align:start position:0%
don't have to be selecting party
 
03:28:33.269 --> 03:28:33.279 align:start position:0%
nominees in a primary election they can
 
03:28:35.429 --> 03:28:35.439 align:start position:0%
just do a nonpartisan he could call it a
 
03:28:36.950 --> 03:28:36.960 align:start position:0%
nonpartisan if it's nonpartisan and
 
03:28:37.990 --> 03:28:38.000 align:start position:0%
you're not selecting the primary
 
03:28:40.150 --> 03:28:40.160 align:start position:0%
nominees then it's perfectly
 
03:28:43.030 --> 03:28:43.040 align:start position:0%
constitutional and I was like wait what
 
03:28:44.309 --> 03:28:44.319 align:start position:0%
and that's when I started you know
 
03:28:45.750 --> 03:28:45.760 align:start position:0%
really working hard as an electoral
 
03:28:48.309 --> 03:28:48.319 align:start position:0%
reform former working in favor of such
 
03:28:51.710 --> 03:28:51.720 align:start position:0%
things such as nonpartisan primaries
 
03:28:55.510 --> 03:28:55.520 align:start position:0%
so I I favor nonpartisan uh single
 
03:28:57.510 --> 03:28:57.520 align:start position:0%
ballot primaries because independent
 
03:29:00.150 --> 03:29:00.160 align:start position:0%
voters rights are very important and a
 
03:29:01.830 --> 03:29:01.840 align:start position:0%
law review article in
 
03:29:03.870 --> 03:29:03.880 align:start position:0%
2019 I can you to bring your remarks to
 
03:29:05.510 --> 03:29:05.520 align:start position:0%

03:29:12.910 --> 03:29:12.920 align:start position:0%
let all voters vote uh Independence and
 
03:29:14.630 --> 03:29:14.640 align:start position:0%

03:29:17.110 --> 03:29:17.120 align:start position:0%
rights in the United States is a very
 
03:29:18.910 --> 03:29:18.920 align:start position:0%
important law review article Taro law
 
03:29:21.990 --> 03:29:22.000 align:start position:0%

03:29:23.349 --> 03:29:23.359 align:start position:0%

as independent and people who are
 
03:29:32.229 --> 03:29:32.239 align:start position:0%
independent candidates really need to
 
03:29:34.750 --> 03:29:34.760 align:start position:0%
have a Level Playing Field in the in
 
03:29:37.510 --> 03:29:37.520 align:start position:0%
electoral politics to be able to not to
 
03:29:39.469 --> 03:29:39.479 align:start position:0%

03:30:38.990 --> 03:30:39.000 align:start position:0%
primaries per se it's about the rights
 
03:30:40.830 --> 03:30:40.840 align:start position:0%

03:31:15.389 --> 03:31:15.399 align:start position:0%
committee for the record my name is
 
03:31:18.750 --> 03:31:18.760 align:start position:0%
Warner horn and uh I'm going to help the
 
03:31:20.950 --> 03:31:20.960 align:start position:0%
committee by not repeating all of the
 
03:31:22.469 --> 03:31:22.479 align:start position:0%
excellent points you guys have heard
 
03:31:26.710 --> 03:31:26.720 align:start position:0%
already instead uh I'm going to give you
 
03:31:30.429 --> 03:31:30.439 align:start position:0%
my feedback on the citizens assembly
 
03:31:31.990 --> 03:31:32.000 align:start position:0%
that took place in June Through The Eyes
 
03:31:33.150 --> 03:31:33.160 align:start position:0%
of a former
 
03:31:36.790 --> 03:31:36.800 align:start position:0%
legislature so I went to the committee I
 
03:31:39.590 --> 03:31:39.600 align:start position:0%
was intrigued by their offer of civil
 
03:31:42.389 --> 03:31:42.399 align:start position:0%
discourse about all sides being hurt
 
03:31:46.710 --> 03:31:46.720 align:start position:0%
equally and to my great surprise
 
03:31:51.030 --> 03:31:51.040 align:start position:0%
they meant it we had 48 hours over 3
 
03:31:54.150 --> 03:31:54.160 align:start position:0%
days of excellent communication
 
03:31:56.990 --> 03:31:57.000 align:start position:0%
respectful discourse points were heard
 
03:31:58.510 --> 03:31:58.520 align:start position:0%
and when there was disagreement there
 
03:32:02.990 --> 03:32:03.000 align:start position:0%
was no polarization of feelings
 
03:32:05.469 --> 03:32:05.479 align:start position:0%
everybody walked out of there at least
 
03:32:08.030 --> 03:32:08.040 align:start position:0%
willing to shake hands if not willing to
 
03:32:11.750 --> 03:32:11.760 align:start position:0%
stay civil and the most intriguing thing
 
03:32:14.469 --> 03:32:14.479 align:start position:0%
to me as a former legislator
 
03:32:16.630 --> 03:32:16.640 align:start position:0%
was they were bringing information
 
03:32:19.389 --> 03:32:19.399 align:start position:0%
forward that I would not have considered
 
03:32:22.110 --> 03:32:22.120 align:start position:0%
in any other like context I've had more
 
03:32:24.349 --> 03:32:24.359 align:start position:0%
than enough constituent engagement as a
 
03:32:26.150 --> 03:32:26.160 align:start position:0%
representative and they were saying
 
03:32:28.030 --> 03:32:28.040 align:start position:0%
things to me that I hadn't
 
03:32:30.469 --> 03:32:30.479 align:start position:0%
heard which makes me think there is
 
03:32:33.550 --> 03:32:33.560 align:start position:0%
exceptional value to the organization
 
03:32:35.229 --> 03:32:35.239 align:start position:0%
and the process by which we got this
 
03:32:39.229 --> 03:32:39.239 align:start position:0%
legislation out we as legislators are
 
03:32:42.189 --> 03:32:42.199 align:start position:0%
starved for the information that helps
 
03:32:44.510 --> 03:32:44.520 align:start position:0%
us make decisions we go to Great Lengths
 
03:32:48.429 --> 03:32:48.439 align:start position:0%
to secure it for these individuals to
 
03:32:51.830 --> 03:32:51.840 align:start position:0%
have organized and produced a way for us
 
03:32:53.349 --> 03:32:53.359 align:start position:0%
to learn more about what the New
 
03:32:54.670 --> 03:32:54.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire citizens are thinking and
 
03:32:57.429 --> 03:32:57.439 align:start position:0%
feeling that's exceptional and valuable
 
03:32:59.349 --> 03:32:59.359 align:start position:0%
and with that Mr chairman I'm happy to
 
03:33:01.550 --> 03:33:01.560 align:start position:0%
take questions okay are there questions
 
03:33:02.590 --> 03:33:02.600 align:start position:0%

03:33:05.670 --> 03:33:05.680 align:start position:0%

03:33:20.550 --> 03:33:20.560 align:start position:0%
my question is what other things came
 
03:33:24.070 --> 03:33:24.080 align:start position:0%
out of that of this assembly than this
 
03:33:27.910 --> 03:33:27.920 align:start position:0%

03:33:29.269 --> 03:33:29.279 align:start position:0%
do you
 
03:33:33.229 --> 03:33:33.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:35.670 --> 03:33:35.680 align:start position:0%
so I'm sorry could you repeat the
 
03:33:38.269 --> 03:33:38.279 align:start position:0%
question were there other initiatives

assembly there were three initiatives
 
03:33:47.150 --> 03:33:47.160 align:start position:0%
that passed this 75% threshold and they
 
03:33:50.710 --> 03:33:50.720 align:start position:0%
were all fairly unique um in that
 
03:33:53.269 --> 03:33:53.279 align:start position:0%
respect so any of the other things that
 
03:33:55.510 --> 03:33:55.520 align:start position:0%
were discussed wouldn't have made the
 
03:33:59.429 --> 03:33:59.439 align:start position:0%
75% um margin and wouldn't have been
 
03:34:02.189 --> 03:34:02.199 align:start position:0%
valuable connected to this specific
 
03:34:04.309 --> 03:34:04.319 align:start position:0%
legislation further questions from the
 
03:34:06.910 --> 03:34:06.920 align:start position:0%
committee saying none thank you uh next
 
03:34:11.429 --> 03:34:11.439 align:start position:0%
up is Eric here and then on Deck is
 
03:34:17.110 --> 03:34:17.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:18.630 --> 03:34:18.640 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I speak this
 
03:34:20.790 --> 03:34:20.800 align:start position:0%
afternoon in support of HB
 
03:34:23.550 --> 03:34:23.560 align:start position:0%
714 I am Eric her resident of Hill New
 
03:34:26.189 --> 03:34:26.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the bookends of my career have
 
03:34:28.349 --> 03:34:28.359 align:start position:0%
been Public Service First on the staff
 
03:34:30.309 --> 03:34:30.319 align:start position:0%
of a republican president's Council of
 
03:34:32.630 --> 03:34:32.640 align:start position:0%
economic advisers and in New Hampshire
 
03:34:34.510 --> 03:34:34.520 align:start position:0%
assignments for every Governor from
 
03:34:36.030 --> 03:34:36.040 align:start position:0%
Shaheen through
 
03:34:38.510 --> 03:34:38.520 align:start position:0%
sununu elections took on a special
 
03:34:40.150 --> 03:34:40.160 align:start position:0%
significance for me when as Hill
 
03:34:41.990 --> 03:34:42.000 align:start position:0%
moderator I watched our citizens
 
03:34:45.030 --> 03:34:45.040 align:start position:0%
exercise their right and duty to vote
 
03:34:47.110 --> 03:34:47.120 align:start position:0%
but it was striking that voters First
 
03:34:49.870 --> 03:34:49.880 align:start position:0%
Act at the polls was to choose a party's
 
03:34:52.389 --> 03:34:52.399 align:start position:0%
primary ballot despite independent
 
03:34:54.830 --> 03:34:54.840 align:start position:0%
voters being the state's largest voting
 
03:34:58.070 --> 03:34:58.080 align:start position:0%
block perhaps we should revise our motto
 
03:35:01.070 --> 03:35:01.080 align:start position:0%
Live Free or Die but vote Republican or
 
03:35:03.269 --> 03:35:03.279 align:start position:0%
Democrat today the purpose of our
 
03:35:05.469 --> 03:35:05.479 align:start position:0%
primary partisan primary system is to
 
03:35:08.349 --> 03:35:08.359 align:start position:0%
nominate a Republican and a Democratic
 
03:35:10.990 --> 03:35:11.000 align:start position:0%
candidate for public office effectively
 
03:35:13.630 --> 03:35:13.640 align:start position:0%
making voting districts agents of our
 
03:35:15.910 --> 03:35:15.920 align:start position:0%
two political parties and local
 
03:35:18.590 --> 03:35:18.600 align:start position:0%
taxpayers the funders of that
 
03:35:21.349 --> 03:35:21.359 align:start position:0%
agency but the essential purpose primary
 
03:35:23.750 --> 03:35:23.760 align:start position:0%
should perform is to ensure that
 
03:35:25.710 --> 03:35:25.720 align:start position:0%
candidates making the general election
 
03:35:27.750 --> 03:35:27.760 align:start position:0%
ballot reflect the will of the citizens
 
03:35:31.110 --> 03:35:31.120 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire independent of party
 
03:35:32.990 --> 03:35:33.000 align:start position:0%
affiliation three essential
 
03:35:36.510 --> 03:35:36.520 align:start position:0%
pro-democracy principles follow first
 
03:35:38.110 --> 03:35:38.120 align:start position:0%
that all votes
 
03:35:40.990 --> 03:35:41.000 align:start position:0%
count second that all votes cast for a
 
03:35:42.790 --> 03:35:42.800 align:start position:0%
candidate are tallied in that
 
03:35:45.950 --> 03:35:45.960 align:start position:0%
candidate's total vote count and and
 
03:35:49.150 --> 03:35:49.160 align:start position:0%
third that all candidates are treated
 
03:35:52.630 --> 03:35:52.640 align:start position:0%
identically our primary process partisan
 
03:35:56.269 --> 03:35:56.279 align:start position:0%
primary process fails these principles
 
03:35:59.550 --> 03:35:59.560 align:start position:0%
to illustrate today a right-in vote on a
 
03:36:02.229 --> 03:36:02.239 align:start position:0%
Democratic primary ballot for a
 
03:36:04.150 --> 03:36:04.160 align:start position:0%
candidate on the Republican primary
 
03:36:07.510 --> 03:36:07.520 align:start position:0%
ballot is not included in the total vote
 
03:36:09.910 --> 03:36:09.920 align:start position:0%
count for that Republican
 
03:36:12.469 --> 03:36:12.479 align:start position:0%
candidate effectively the vote doesn't
 
03:36:14.990 --> 03:36:15.000 align:start position:0%
count and that Republican candidate's
 
03:36:17.429 --> 03:36:17.439 align:start position:0%
total vote account does not reflect the
 
03:36:19.750 --> 03:36:19.760 align:start position:0%
will of all the
 
03:36:24.510 --> 03:36:24.520 align:start position:0%
people HB 714 remedies these
 
03:36:24.520 --> 03:36:26.349 align:start position:0%
people HB 714 remedies these
anti-democratic

03:36:26.349 --> 03:36:26.359 align:start position:0%
anti-democratic
 
03:36:28.389 --> 03:36:28.399 align:start position:0%
failures at Gettysburg Lincoln
 
03:36:30.790 --> 03:36:30.800 align:start position:0%
memorialized our national sacrifice to
 
03:36:33.269 --> 03:36:33.279 align:start position:0%
preserve a government of the People by
 
03:36:35.870 --> 03:36:35.880 align:start position:0%
the people and for the people with your
 
03:36:37.750 --> 03:36:37.760 align:start position:0%

714 you have the opportunity to place
 
03:36:42.670 --> 03:36:42.680 align:start position:0%
the people not political parties at the
 
03:36:44.590 --> 03:36:44.600 align:start position:0%
center of New Hampshire's primary
 
03:36:47.830 --> 03:36:47.840 align:start position:0%

apologies yeah so so those so no if you
 
03:37:27.269 --> 03:37:27.279 align:start position:0%
have copies of written testimony we put

them up front for collection later if
 
03:37:29.469 --> 03:37:29.479 align:start position:0%

03:37:31.630 --> 03:37:31.640 align:start position:0%
reference in your testimony like a graph
 
03:37:32.790 --> 03:37:32.800 align:start position:0%
or something like that obviously we have
 
03:37:34.670 --> 03:37:34.680 align:start position:0%
to have that to hear
 
03:37:37.830 --> 03:37:37.840 align:start position:0%

03:37:40.710 --> 03:37:40.720 align:start position:0%
uh what I just did the paper well

ideological I'm an engineer and I can't

stand something that's not working I've
 
03:37:58.590 --> 03:37:58.600 align:start position:0%
been at this for over 20 years I passed
 
03:38:00.229 --> 03:38:00.239 align:start position:0%
out examples of some of the things I've
 
03:38:02.030 --> 03:38:02.040 align:start position:0%
been doing inition of being on the
 
03:38:05.389 --> 03:38:05.399 align:start position:0%
planning board budget I wrote a book um
 
03:38:06.990 --> 03:38:07.000 align:start position:0%
those numbers I'm going to ask you to
 
03:38:09.830 --> 03:38:09.840 align:start position:0%
help me demonstrate right now so I would
 
03:38:12.229 --> 03:38:12.239 align:start position:0%
like you to all briefly to stand up and
 
03:38:15.790 --> 03:38:15.800 align:start position:0%
Russ I used 18 so can you stand up too
 
03:38:17.830 --> 03:38:17.840 align:start position:0%
just briefly stand up pleas the committe
 
03:38:19.110 --> 03:38:19.120 align:start position:0%
got to remain seated I'm sorry the
 
03:38:20.990 --> 03:38:21.000 align:start position:0%
committe it's very hard to demonstrate I
 
03:38:22.510 --> 03:38:22.520 align:start position:0%
I understand but you're going to have to
 
03:38:24.030 --> 03:38:24.040 align:start position:0%
we to use our imaginations I don't care
 
03:38:25.670 --> 03:38:25.680 align:start position:0%
what the public does but the I'm going
 
03:38:27.269 --> 03:38:27.279 align:start position:0%
to ask the committee members to stay
 
03:38:30.070 --> 03:38:30.080 align:start position:0%
seated all right so much for the effect
 
03:38:34.510 --> 03:38:34.520 align:start position:0%
um if everyone um stood all right I was
 
03:38:35.790 --> 03:38:35.800 align:start position:0%
the points I was going to make that you
 
03:38:38.189 --> 03:38:38.199 align:start position:0%
represent the 1.1 million registered
 
03:38:40.950 --> 03:38:40.960 align:start position:0%
voters for about 96% of the people whove
 
03:38:43.150 --> 03:38:43.160 align:start position:0%
registered to vote all right our common
 
03:38:44.990 --> 03:38:45.000 align:start position:0%
goal should be have 100% of the people
 
03:38:47.710 --> 03:38:47.720 align:start position:0%
particip ipating in all local and state
 
03:38:49.790 --> 03:38:49.800 align:start position:0%
elections all right with the one goal of
 
03:38:52.269 --> 03:38:52.279 align:start position:0%
managing our government better in
 
03:38:55.790 --> 03:38:55.800 align:start position:0%
November 2024 we only had 75.5% of the
 
03:38:58.429 --> 03:38:58.439 align:start position:0%
people registered voters vote so it's
 
03:39:00.990 --> 03:39:01.000 align:start position:0%
going to have four of you sit down Russ
 
03:39:03.269 --> 03:39:03.279 align:start position:0%
and two of the others okay now get a
 
03:39:05.389 --> 03:39:05.399 align:start position:0%
picture of that besides looking at it
 
03:39:10.030 --> 03:39:10.040 align:start position:0%
all right um now in September all right
 
03:39:12.790 --> 03:39:12.800 align:start position:0%
only 222% of the people who voted
 
03:39:14.990 --> 03:39:15.000 align:start position:0%
participate in the SE primary so we're
 
03:39:17.630 --> 03:39:17.640 align:start position:0%
going to round up to four all right and
 
03:39:20.030 --> 03:39:20.040 align:start position:0%
that leaves everyone else that represent
 
03:39:23.110 --> 03:39:23.120 align:start position:0%
the 78% of the people who voted in
 
03:39:25.550 --> 03:39:25.560 align:start position:0%
November all right but did not
 
03:39:28.830 --> 03:39:28.840 align:start position:0%
participate in the primary all right so
 
03:39:30.990 --> 03:39:31.000 align:start position:0%
everyone sitting who is going to be just
 
03:39:32.229 --> 03:39:32.239 align:start position:0%
about everyone else except for the
 
03:39:34.990 --> 03:39:35.000 align:start position:0%
people at the ends all right you need to
 
03:39:36.990 --> 03:39:37.000 align:start position:0%
hope that the people sitting or the
 
03:39:40.030 --> 03:39:40.040 align:start position:0%
people still standing those four people
 
03:39:42.790 --> 03:39:42.800 align:start position:0%
all right represent who you want to see
 
03:39:45.510 --> 03:39:45.520 align:start position:0%
on the November ballot all right what
 
03:39:47.349 --> 03:39:47.359 align:start position:0%
you're looking at with just four people
 
03:39:50.229 --> 03:39:50.239 align:start position:0%
representing all of you is a leverage
 
03:39:52.590 --> 03:39:52.600 align:start position:0%
system all right a disproportional
 
03:39:55.229 --> 03:39:55.239 align:start position:0%
amount of people have power greater than
 
03:39:58.030 --> 03:39:58.040 align:start position:0%
their size all right that's dis known as
 
03:40:01.349 --> 03:40:01.359 align:start position:0%
disproportional power all right um our
 
03:40:04.389 --> 03:40:04.399 align:start position:0%
pedison Pro process because of that's
 
03:40:06.630 --> 03:40:06.640 align:start position:0%
broken all right there's also other
 
03:40:09.790 --> 03:40:09.800 align:start position:0%
issues this caused in 2022 I ran as an
 
03:40:12.389 --> 03:40:12.399 align:start position:0%
independent when I asked people who had
 
03:40:14.590 --> 03:40:14.600 align:start position:0%
already voted if they voted for me none
 
03:40:17.349 --> 03:40:17.359 align:start position:0%
did they also admitted that they had no
 
03:40:18.990 --> 03:40:19.000 align:start position:0%
idea of who the Republican or Democrat
 
03:40:21.150 --> 03:40:21.160 align:start position:0%
options were as we just had a great
 
03:40:23.150 --> 03:40:23.160 align:start position:0%
conversation and they were not enamored
 
03:40:25.110 --> 03:40:25.120 align:start position:0%
with the other party I asked why not
 
03:40:27.710 --> 03:40:27.720 align:start position:0%
support an independent everyone said
 
03:40:30.510 --> 03:40:30.520 align:start position:0%
they voted against the party that scares
 
03:40:32.550 --> 03:40:32.560 align:start position:0%
them the most in our New Hampshire
 
03:40:35.630 --> 03:40:35.640 align:start position:0%
system people are voting against not for
 
03:40:38.189 --> 03:40:38.199 align:start position:0%
people for many Undeclared voters like
 
03:40:39.830 --> 03:40:39.840 align:start position:0%
myself there are people running in the
 
03:40:42.710 --> 03:40:42.720 align:start position:0%
primary on both sides that I prefer much
 
03:40:44.110 --> 03:40:44.120 align:start position:0%
more than those who make it to the
 
03:40:46.349 --> 03:40:46.359 align:start position:0%
November ballot we're paying for the
 
03:40:48.030 --> 03:40:48.040 align:start position:0%
primary and I want the right and the
 
03:40:50.550 --> 03:40:50.560 align:start position:0%
freedom to vote for the candidates I
 
03:40:53.429 --> 03:40:53.439 align:start position:0%
like regardless of party affiliation the
 
03:40:54.830 --> 03:40:54.840 align:start position:0%
parties are not paying for these
 
03:40:57.710 --> 03:40:57.720 align:start position:0%
partisan primaries we are after the 22
 
03:40:59.429 --> 03:40:59.439 align:start position:0%
September primaries I did some back ofth
 
03:41:01.070 --> 03:41:01.080 align:start position:0%
math envelope to estimate what cities
 
03:41:03.349 --> 03:41:03.359 align:start position:0%
and towns pay all right it worked out to
 
03:41:06.750 --> 03:41:06.760 align:start position:0%
be around 4.5 million what cities and
 
03:41:08.670 --> 03:41:08.680 align:start position:0%
towns pays that does not count what the
 
03:41:11.229 --> 03:41:11.239 align:start position:0%
secretary of state pays for these that's
 
03:41:12.510 --> 03:41:12.520 align:start position:0%
something that
 
03:41:15.349 --> 03:41:15.359 align:start position:0%
900,000 people in New Hampshire did not
 
03:41:18.349 --> 03:41:18.359 align:start position:0%
not use all right it's no mystery that
 
03:41:20.150 --> 03:41:20.160 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire citizens assembly this
 
03:41:21.990 --> 03:41:22.000 align:start position:0%
came out as something we should move
 
03:41:24.469 --> 03:41:24.479 align:start position:0%
forward so the first thing I did well
 
03:41:26.990 --> 03:41:27.000 align:start position:0%
I'm at the your your time's expired so
 
03:41:28.710 --> 03:41:28.720 align:start position:0%
if you can well I had to use a lot of it
 
03:41:31.309 --> 03:41:31.319 align:start position:0%
not getting you to stand I I understand
 
03:41:32.870 --> 03:41:32.880 align:start position:0%
but your time has expired so just
 
03:41:35.830 --> 03:41:35.840 align:start position:0%
briefly I went through all the rsas went
 
03:41:39.070 --> 03:41:39.080 align:start position:0%
through and what I learned all right is
 
03:41:44.070 --> 03:41:44.080 align:start position:0%
that um the we've create the our rsis
 
03:41:46.269 --> 03:41:46.279 align:start position:0%
rsas have created two classes of people
 
03:41:48.189 --> 03:41:48.199 align:start position:0%
those in the parties and those who are
 
03:41:50.349 --> 03:41:50.359 align:start position:0%
not all right it keeps people from
 
03:41:52.670 --> 03:41:52.680 align:start position:0%
participating in the process all right
 
03:41:54.750 --> 03:41:54.760 align:start position:0%
and everything you're going to hear all
 
03:41:57.149 --> 03:41:57.159 align:start position:0%
right opposing this all right is a
 
03:41:59.590 --> 03:41:59.600 align:start position:0%
challenge none of this is a showstopper
 
03:42:02.990 --> 03:42:03.000 align:start position:0%
everyone is a solvable problem myself
 
03:42:05.110 --> 03:42:05.120 align:start position:0%
and others are more than willing to work
 
03:42:07.550 --> 03:42:07.560 align:start position:0%
with us to make this change that should
 
03:42:09.870 --> 03:42:09.880 align:start position:0%
get us our common denom goal which is
 
03:42:13.510 --> 03:42:13.520 align:start position:0%
getting more people participating in our
 
03:42:15.429 --> 03:42:15.439 align:start position:0%
process I will be more than glad to
 
03:42:17.189 --> 03:42:17.199 align:start position:0%
answer questions for two 10 minutes or
 
03:42:19.149 --> 03:42:19.159 align:start position:0%
30 minutes there is no time limit on
 
03:42:20.429 --> 03:42:20.439 align:start position:0%
questions I've never imposed one of
 
03:42:21.990 --> 03:42:22.000 align:start position:0%
those so all right so I handed out a lot
 
03:42:23.630 --> 03:42:23.640 align:start position:0%
of stuff and ask anything you ever
 
03:42:25.990 --> 03:42:26.000 align:start position:0%
wanted to know about are there questions
 
03:42:26.830 --> 03:42:26.840 align:start position:0%
from the
 
03:42:30.269 --> 03:42:30.279 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none thank you all
 
03:42:31.990 --> 03:42:32.000 align:start position:0%
right lucky I'm in sales and I'm not
 
03:42:35.349 --> 03:42:35.359 align:start position:0%
hurt uh next up is Daryl D'Angelo and on
 
03:42:41.389 --> 03:42:41.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:45.910 --> 03:42:45.920 align:start position:0%
Briggs hi I'm nervous sorry
 
03:42:47.670 --> 03:42:47.680 align:start position:0%
my name is Daryl D'Angelo I'm from
 
03:42:50.229 --> 03:42:50.239 align:start position:0%
Amherst New Hampshire I have been an
 
03:42:53.309 --> 03:42:53.319 align:start position:0%
independent unaffiliated voter my entire
 
03:42:56.790 --> 03:42:56.800 align:start position:0%
life um and I've drifted in and out
 
03:42:59.189 --> 03:42:59.199 align:start position:0%
through the primary process here but
 
03:43:01.510 --> 03:43:01.520 align:start position:0%
always immediately disaffiliated because
 
03:43:04.670 --> 03:43:04.680 align:start position:0%
I kind of float that way um and over all
 
03:43:07.510 --> 03:43:07.520 align:start position:0%
these years I've watched things move
 
03:43:09.469 --> 03:43:09.479 align:start position:0%
further and further away from
 
03:43:12.590 --> 03:43:12.600 align:start position:0%
representing me we often speak of the
 
03:43:14.429 --> 03:43:14.439 align:start position:0%
state as a controlling and limiting
 
03:43:17.670 --> 03:43:17.680 align:start position:0%
entity but at its best government seeks
 
03:43:20.070 --> 03:43:20.080 align:start position:0%
to remove barriers that prevent people
 
03:43:22.229 --> 03:43:22.239 align:start position:0%
from freely exercising their rights and
 
03:43:25.950 --> 03:43:25.960 align:start position:0%
freedoms HB 714 is an effort to increase
 
03:43:27.429 --> 03:43:27.439 align:start position:0%
freedom and choice for all Granite
 
03:43:29.429 --> 03:43:29.439 align:start position:0%
Staters our current system is
 
03:43:31.030 --> 03:43:31.040 align:start position:0%
experiencing multiple
 
03:43:34.149 --> 03:43:34.159 align:start position:0%
problems for one toxic polarization is
 
03:43:36.349 --> 03:43:36.359 align:start position:0%
NE negatively affecting our state it's a
 
03:43:37.750 --> 03:43:37.760 align:start position:0%
phenomenon it didn't originate here we
 
03:43:39.990 --> 03:43:40.000 align:start position:0%
didn't start it but it's hitting us very
 
03:43:41.229 --> 03:43:41.239 align:start position:0%
very hard and it's creating an
 
03:43:44.110 --> 03:43:44.120 align:start position:0%
environment of fear I was a ballot clerk
 
03:43:45.870 --> 03:43:45.880 align:start position:0%
for many years our Town won't let me
 
03:43:48.349 --> 03:43:48.359 align:start position:0%
participate anymore as an unaffiliated
 
03:43:49.870 --> 03:43:49.880 align:start position:0%
voter because they're worried about
 
03:43:53.070 --> 03:43:53.080 align:start position:0%
challenges I need they only want an even
 
03:43:55.309 --> 03:43:55.319 align:start position:0%
number of registered people at the
 
03:43:57.910 --> 03:43:57.920 align:start position:0%
tables now uh anger and marginalization
 
03:43:59.469 --> 03:43:59.479 align:start position:0%
are leaving to disenfranchisement
 
03:44:01.790 --> 03:44:01.800 align:start position:0%
withdraw from the process the people
 
03:44:04.349 --> 03:44:04.359 align:start position:0%
that do participate misuse the process
 
03:44:07.189 --> 03:44:07.199 align:start position:0%
frequently just to cast no votes we're
 
03:44:10.070 --> 03:44:10.080 align:start position:0%
stifling the marketplace of ideas we are
 
03:44:12.790 --> 03:44:12.800 align:start position:0%
blessed by the foresight of our Founders
 
03:44:14.510 --> 03:44:14.520 align:start position:0%
who codified freedom of speech in our
 
03:44:15.830 --> 03:44:15.840 align:start position:0%
first amendment
 
03:44:18.630 --> 03:44:18.640 align:start position:0%
it's often said that the best answer to
 
03:44:21.510 --> 03:44:21.520 align:start position:0%
bad speech is more speech nowhere is
 
03:44:23.269 --> 03:44:23.279 align:start position:0%
this more true than in the marketplace
 
03:44:26.110 --> 03:44:26.120 align:start position:0%
of ideas yet our current primaries
 
03:44:28.389 --> 03:44:28.399 align:start position:0%
systemat systematically exclude the
 
03:44:31.149 --> 03:44:31.159 align:start position:0%
voices of everyone not directly
 
03:44:32.510 --> 03:44:32.520 align:start position:0%
affiliated with one of only two
 
03:44:35.269 --> 03:44:35.279 align:start position:0%
political parties and competition is
 
03:44:38.389 --> 03:44:38.399 align:start position:0%
being stifled with competition requires
 
03:44:40.670 --> 03:44:40.680 align:start position:0%
free speech and equal ability to discuss
 
03:44:43.149 --> 03:44:43.159 align:start position:0%
and debate ideas and finally we have
 
03:44:46.269 --> 03:44:46.279 align:start position:0%
unequal ballot access as publicly funded
 
03:44:48.670 --> 03:44:48.680 align:start position:0%
events our primary elections must by
 
03:44:51.070 --> 03:44:51.080 align:start position:0%
definition be open to the public but
 
03:44:53.710 --> 03:44:53.720 align:start position:0%
that doesn't merely mean voters public
 
03:44:55.469 --> 03:44:55.479 align:start position:0%
includes the voices of the largest
 
03:44:57.309 --> 03:44:57.319 align:start position:0%
voting Block in our state the
 
03:44:59.790 --> 03:44:59.800 align:start position:0%
unaffiliated our primaries provide
 
03:45:01.950 --> 03:45:01.960 align:start position:0%
Public Funding for private organizations
 
03:45:04.189 --> 03:45:04.199 align:start position:0%
the parties and since the public foots
 
03:45:06.510 --> 03:45:06.520 align:start position:0%
the bill the barriers to participation
 
03:45:10.429 --> 03:45:10.439 align:start position:0%
have to come down HB 714 recognizes and
 
03:45:12.830 --> 03:45:12.840 align:start position:0%
attempts to remove these barriers our
 
03:45:13.990 --> 03:45:14.000 align:start position:0%
forefathers fought for their
 
03:45:15.510 --> 03:45:15.520 align:start position:0%
independence from England because as a
 
03:45:18.309 --> 03:45:18.319 align:start position:0%
colony they were being taxed but had no
 
03:45:20.229 --> 03:45:20.239 align:start position:0%
representation representation is
 
03:45:22.710 --> 03:45:22.720 align:start position:0%
fundamental to America's liberal values
 
03:45:24.670 --> 03:45:24.680 align:start position:0%
as a New Hampshire property owner I help
 
03:45:26.710 --> 03:45:26.720 align:start position:0%
fund our state primaries but as an
 
03:45:28.990 --> 03:45:29.000 align:start position:0%
independent unaffiliated voter I'm not
 
03:45:31.309 --> 03:45:31.319 align:start position:0%
represented in the process independent
 
03:45:33.189 --> 03:45:33.199 align:start position:0%
voters have no primary candidates from
 
03:45:35.070 --> 03:45:35.080 align:start position:0%
which they can choose other than those
 
03:45:37.189 --> 03:45:37.199 align:start position:0%
of the two major parties I hope the
 
03:45:38.990 --> 03:45:39.000 align:start position:0%
committee moves this bill forward thank
 
03:45:40.469 --> 03:45:40.479 align:start position:0%
you thank you will you be taking
 
03:45:43.229 --> 03:45:43.239 align:start position:0%
questions are there questions seeing
 
03:45:47.309 --> 03:45:47.319 align:start position:0%
none thank you um next up is Lyn Briggs
 
03:45:58.990 --> 03:45:59.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:02.389 --> 03:46:02.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:05.550 --> 03:46:05.560 align:start position:0%
afternoon Bill 7114 oh sorry ly Briggs
 
03:46:09.070 --> 03:46:09.080 align:start position:0%
amers New Hampshire Bill
 
03:46:11.990 --> 03:46:12.000 align:start position:0%
7114 to me speaking as a ballot Clerk of
 
03:46:14.110 --> 03:46:14.120 align:start position:0%
several years I am no longer a ballot
 
03:46:14.120 --> 03:46:15.990 align:start position:0%
several years I am no longer a ballot
Clerk

03:46:15.990 --> 03:46:16.000 align:start position:0%
Clerk
 
03:46:18.349 --> 03:46:18.359 align:start position:0%
is a problem because I would watch
 
03:46:22.550 --> 03:46:22.560 align:start position:0%
Undeclared which is not a party come in
 
03:46:25.630 --> 03:46:25.640 align:start position:0%
and be very aggressive very angry for
 
03:46:27.910 --> 03:46:27.920 align:start position:0%
whatever reason I'm not making judgment
 
03:46:30.309 --> 03:46:30.319 align:start position:0%
and demand a ballot or not when they
 
03:46:33.110 --> 03:46:33.120 align:start position:0%
were finished uh voting they would go
 
03:46:35.790 --> 03:46:35.800 align:start position:0%
get into the line where you change
 
03:46:38.429 --> 03:46:38.439 align:start position:0%
back it seems to me that
 
03:46:41.990 --> 03:46:42.000 align:start position:0%
that is a
 
03:46:45.349 --> 03:46:45.359 align:start position:0%
really disgusting way to behave
 
03:46:48.349 --> 03:46:48.359 align:start position:0%
a horrible way to have to choose so if
 
03:46:49.790 --> 03:46:49.800 align:start position:0%
we have a Republican party and a
 
03:46:51.309 --> 03:46:51.319 align:start position:0%
Democrat Party which are private
 
03:46:53.910 --> 03:46:53.920 align:start position:0%
entities then maybe we need an
 
03:46:56.070 --> 03:46:56.080 align:start position:0%
independent Undeclared is what it is an
 
03:46:58.309 --> 03:46:58.319 align:start position:0%
inde an independent party that is
 
03:47:00.710 --> 03:47:00.720 align:start position:0%
privately funded just throwing it out
 
03:47:03.070 --> 03:47:03.080 align:start position:0%
there from my my observations and what's
 
03:47:06.229 --> 03:47:06.239 align:start position:0%
been going on last week I did um
 
03:47:09.030 --> 03:47:09.040 align:start position:0%
testify about the
 
03:47:12.309 --> 03:47:12.319 align:start position:0%
Undeclared not choosing a
 
03:47:17.269 --> 03:47:17.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:18.950 --> 03:47:18.960 align:start position:0%
it was extended to
 
03:47:22.030 --> 03:47:22.040 align:start position:0%
October that allowed 4,000 plus
 
03:47:23.950 --> 03:47:23.960 align:start position:0%
Democrats to become independent or
 
03:47:26.710 --> 03:47:26.720 align:start position:0%
Undeclared which again is not a party so
 
03:47:29.870 --> 03:47:29.880 align:start position:0%
we either have to choose the two parties
 
03:47:31.189 --> 03:47:31.199 align:start position:0%
the private
 
03:47:35.389 --> 03:47:35.399 align:start position:0%
parties in in June to participate in the
 
03:47:38.510 --> 03:47:38.520 align:start position:0%
primary or we need to go to three
 
03:47:41.149 --> 03:47:41.159 align:start position:0%
private parties and I'll just keep it
 
03:47:41.159 --> 03:47:41.870 align:start position:0%
private parties and I'll just keep it
that

03:47:41.870 --> 03:47:41.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:47:44.590 --> 03:47:44.600 align:start position:0%
simple okay uh questions from the
 
03:47:44.600 --> 03:47:45.790 align:start position:0%
simple okay uh questions from the
committee

03:47:45.790 --> 03:47:45.800 align:start position:0%
committee
 
03:47:47.149 --> 03:47:47.159 align:start position:0%
um I will say I am glad actually you
 
03:47:48.590 --> 03:47:48.600 align:start position:0%
reconciled that cuz I was wondering how
 
03:47:50.510 --> 03:47:50.520 align:start position:0%
you were going to get there and you did
 
03:47:53.309 --> 03:47:53.319 align:start position:0%
so cool um so thanks for that I I sitt I
 
03:47:54.710 --> 03:47:54.720 align:start position:0%
was like you were just here last week
 
03:47:57.149 --> 03:47:57.159 align:start position:0%
and you didn't say that you didn't say
 
03:47:59.030 --> 03:47:59.040 align:start position:0%
uh next uh any other questions from the
 
03:48:01.830 --> 03:48:01.840 align:start position:0%
committee uh Linda Bundy and then on
 
03:48:05.950 --> 03:48:05.960 align:start position:0%
Deck is uh Kaylee
 
03:48:08.590 --> 03:48:08.600 align:start position:0%
estadio yeah
 
03:48:10.389 --> 03:48:10.399 align:start position:0%
I'm it's going to get to the point where
 
03:48:11.830 --> 03:48:11.840 align:start position:0%
I don't even look for validation on it
 
03:48:12.910 --> 03:48:12.920 align:start position:0%
anymore I'm just going to know that I
 
03:48:17.990 --> 03:48:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:19.750 --> 03:48:19.760 align:start position:0%
good afternoon chairman Barry and
 
03:48:21.790 --> 03:48:21.800 align:start position:0%
members of house election law my name is
 
03:48:24.110 --> 03:48:24.120 align:start position:0%
Linda Bundy and I'm from
 
03:48:27.630 --> 03:48:27.640 align:start position:0%
antrum in June 2024 the New Hampshire
 
03:48:29.950 --> 03:48:29.960 align:start position:0%
together citizens assembly brought
 
03:48:31.830 --> 03:48:31.840 align:start position:0%
together 50 New Hampshire residents
 
03:48:33.790 --> 03:48:33.800 align:start position:0%
representing a cross-section of the
 
03:48:36.790 --> 03:48:36.800 align:start position:0%
state's demographics and political
 
03:48:39.550 --> 03:48:39.560 align:start position:0%
ideologies over three days of discussion
 
03:48:42.149 --> 03:48:42.159 align:start position:0%
and debate they found common ground and
 
03:48:45.030 --> 03:48:45.040 align:start position:0%
de decided upon four key recommendations
 
03:48:48.309 --> 03:48:48.319 align:start position:0%
S one of these was establishing a single
 
03:48:51.790 --> 03:48:51.800 align:start position:0%
ballot primary a single ballot primary
 
03:48:54.229 --> 03:48:54.239 align:start position:0%
allows all voter to consider all
 
03:48:56.870 --> 03:48:56.880 align:start position:0%
candidates without being restricted to
 
03:48:56.880 --> 03:48:57.990 align:start position:0%
candidates without being restricted to
one

03:48:57.990 --> 03:48:58.000 align:start position:0%
one
 
03:49:00.990 --> 03:49:01.000 align:start position:0%
party the largest group of Voters in New
 
03:49:03.870 --> 03:49:03.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is Undeclared not Republican
 
03:49:06.830 --> 03:49:06.840 align:start position:0%
or Democratic there is a stronga
 
03:49:09.750 --> 03:49:09.760 align:start position:0%
tradition of people voting across party
 
03:49:12.830 --> 03:49:12.840 align:start position:0%
lines it makes sense to simplify voting
 
03:49:16.110 --> 03:49:16.120 align:start position:0%
in the state and Congressional primaries
 
03:49:17.950 --> 03:49:17.960 align:start position:0%
this system would give voters more
 
03:49:20.870 --> 03:49:20.880 align:start position:0%
choice and ensure that Winners have
 
03:49:24.590 --> 03:49:24.600 align:start position:0%
broad support our current system leads
 
03:49:26.990 --> 03:49:27.000 align:start position:0%
to both parties nominating candidates
 
03:49:30.110 --> 03:49:30.120 align:start position:0%
with more extreme views both left and
 
03:49:33.590 --> 03:49:33.600 align:start position:0%
right a single ballot primary is a step
 
03:49:36.070 --> 03:49:36.080 align:start position:0%
toward reducing polarization because it
 
03:49:39.910 --> 03:49:39.920 align:start position:0%
does not favor any side I've worked as a
 
03:49:42.429 --> 03:49:42.439 align:start position:0%
ballot clerk in Anum since
 
03:49:45.269 --> 03:49:45.279 align:start position:0%
2022 and there always are Undeclared
 
03:49:47.510 --> 03:49:47.520 align:start position:0%
voters who do not like having to declare
 
03:49:50.510 --> 03:49:50.520 align:start position:0%
a party in order to vote on a number of
 
03:49:52.309 --> 03:49:52.319 align:start position:0%
occasions when I've explained this to
 
03:49:54.670 --> 03:49:54.680 align:start position:0%
them they have stated I want to vote for
 
03:49:57.670 --> 03:49:57.680 align:start position:0%
the candidate not the party a single
 
03:50:00.510 --> 03:50:00.520 align:start position:0%
ballot primary eliminates the time and
 
03:50:02.710 --> 03:50:02.720 align:start position:0%
busy work that Undeclared voters and
 
03:50:05.229 --> 03:50:05.239 align:start position:0%
election workers have to spend choosing
 
03:50:07.870 --> 03:50:07.880 align:start position:0%
a party before voting and then switching
 
03:50:11.229 --> 03:50:11.239 align:start position:0%
back to Undeclared after I agree with a
 
03:50:13.750 --> 03:50:13.760 align:start position:0%
diverse group of New Hampshire citizens
 
03:50:15.910 --> 03:50:15.920 align:start position:0%
from the citizens assembly who believe
 
03:50:18.910 --> 03:50:18.920 align:start position:0%
that a single ballot primary system will
 
03:50:21.750 --> 03:50:21.760 align:start position:0%
best serve our voters by reducing
 
03:50:23.590 --> 03:50:23.600 align:start position:0%
polarization and providing more
 
03:50:27.429 --> 03:50:27.439 align:start position:0%
meaningful choices thank you for the
 
03:50:30.149 --> 03:50:30.159 align:start position:0%
opportunity thank you so much Miss Bundy
 
03:50:31.389 --> 03:50:31.399 align:start position:0%
I assume you're not taking questions by
 
03:50:33.229 --> 03:50:33.239 align:start position:0%
you're getting up that's totally fine
 
03:50:36.229 --> 03:50:36.239 align:start position:0%
next up is Kaylee estadio and uh then on
 
03:50:40.910 --> 03:50:40.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:43.269 --> 03:50:43.279 align:start position:0%
scanland well we do elect him so he is
 
03:50:45.070 --> 03:50:45.080 align:start position:0%
our own
 
03:50:46.790 --> 03:50:46.800 align:start position:0%
think about that I just blew your mind
 
03:50:49.790 --> 03:50:49.800 align:start position:0%
there didn't I good afternoon um thank
 
03:50:51.670 --> 03:50:51.680 align:start position:0%
you chairman Barry and members of the
 
03:50:53.790 --> 03:50:53.800 align:start position:0%
committee for the record my name is Kaye
 
03:50:56.149 --> 03:50:56.159 align:start position:0%
abrao I'm a Durham voter and public
 
03:50:58.510 --> 03:50:58.520 align:start position:0%
policy fellow with open democracy we're
 
03:51:00.189 --> 03:51:00.199 align:start position:0%
nonpartisan nonprofit representing
 
03:51:03.229 --> 03:51:03.239 align:start position:0%
36,000 voters across the state and today
 
03:51:05.790 --> 03:51:05.800 align:start position:0%
I am testifying in support of HB
 
03:51:08.269 --> 03:51:08.279 align:start position:0%
714 um as the merits of the bill have
 
03:51:10.830 --> 03:51:10.840 align:start position:0%
already been highlighted I want to focus
 
03:51:13.030 --> 03:51:13.040 align:start position:0%
on today's party
 
03:51:44.630 --> 03:51:44.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:47.149 --> 03:51:47.159 align:start position:0%
constructed Union was quote its tendency
 
03:51:49.149 --> 03:51:49.159 align:start position:0%
to break and control the violence of
 
03:51:51.149 --> 03:51:51.159 align:start position:0%
faction which I think we could all use
 
03:51:55.229 --> 03:51:55.239 align:start position:0%
today and with HB H with HB 714 this
 
03:51:57.429 --> 03:51:57.439 align:start position:0%
committee has the opportunity to do just
 
03:51:59.950 --> 03:51:59.960 align:start position:0%
that the primary voting system should be
 
03:52:01.670 --> 03:52:01.680 align:start position:0%
built around the needs of the people it
 
03:52:04.269 --> 03:52:04.279 align:start position:0%
serves and not the other way around this
 
03:52:06.229 --> 03:52:06.239 align:start position:0%
is not the case today as New Hampshire
 
03:52:08.030 --> 03:52:08.040 align:start position:0%
taxpayers essentially subsidize
 
03:52:09.990 --> 03:52:10.000 align:start position:0%
political party Party candidate
 
03:52:12.149 --> 03:52:12.159 align:start position:0%
selection for the two major parties
 
03:52:13.710 --> 03:52:13.720 align:start position:0%
despite Independence making up the
 
03:52:15.830 --> 03:52:15.840 align:start position:0%
majority of the voter voting block a
 
03:52:17.389 --> 03:52:17.399 align:start position:0%
single party ballot would work to bring
 
03:52:19.429 --> 03:52:19.439 align:start position:0%
the power back to the people and away
 
03:52:22.070 --> 03:52:22.080 align:start position:0%
from the party systems two blue States
 
03:52:24.269 --> 03:52:24.279 align:start position:0%
Washington and California and two red
 
03:52:26.710 --> 03:52:26.720 align:start position:0%
States Nebraska and Alaska currently
 
03:52:29.269 --> 03:52:29.279 align:start position:0%
utilize single ballot party single party
 
03:52:31.309 --> 03:52:31.319 align:start position:0%
ballots in their primaries and none have
 
03:52:33.269 --> 03:52:33.279 align:start position:0%
found that the system favors one party
 
03:52:36.030 --> 03:52:36.040 align:start position:0%
over another so for these reasons I urge
 
03:52:39.309 --> 03:52:39.319 align:start position:0%
you to vote a to pass on HB 714 to put
 
03:52:41.030 --> 03:52:41.040 align:start position:0%
people over party and better meet the
 
03:52:43.389 --> 03:52:43.399 align:start position:0%
needs of all graters thank you and I
 
03:52:45.030 --> 03:52:45.040 align:start position:0%
will take questions if there are
 
03:52:46.149 --> 03:52:46.159 align:start position:0%
okay are there questions from the
 
03:52:49.229 --> 03:52:49.239 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none thank you last up
 
03:52:52.750 --> 03:52:52.760 align:start position:0%
is Secretary of skate skate Secretary of
 
03:52:55.030 --> 03:52:55.040 align:start position:0%
State David scanland and representative
 
03:52:58.110 --> 03:52:58.120 align:start position:0%
gazi if you could grab the blue sheet
 
03:52:58.120 --> 03:53:00.790 align:start position:0%
gazi if you could grab the blue sheet
for

03:53:00.790 --> 03:53:00.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:02.910 --> 03:53:02.920 align:start position:0%
me a chance to take it all in Mr
 
03:53:04.590 --> 03:53:04.600 align:start position:0%
secretary now you get to
 
03:53:07.269 --> 03:53:07.279 align:start position:0%
oine thank you Mr chairman I'll I'll
 
03:53:09.950 --> 03:53:09.960 align:start position:0%
keep this brief um first of all I did
 
03:53:11.309 --> 03:53:11.319 align:start position:0%
have the opportunity to address the
 
03:53:13.950 --> 03:53:13.960 align:start position:0%
citizens assembly uh when they met last
 
03:53:16.469 --> 03:53:16.479 align:start position:0%
year it it was a really good exercise
 
03:53:18.830 --> 03:53:18.840 align:start position:0%
and I hope that kind of dialogue
 
03:53:22.110 --> 03:53:22.120 align:start position:0%
continues around the state um they did a
 
03:53:24.389 --> 03:53:24.399 align:start position:0%
lot of outside the box thinking and I
 
03:53:28.269 --> 03:53:28.279 align:start position:0%
think that house bill 714 reflects that
 
03:53:29.990 --> 03:53:30.000 align:start position:0%
but it would represent a really
 
03:53:31.750 --> 03:53:31.760 align:start position:0%
fundamental change in the way that we
 
03:53:35.110 --> 03:53:35.120 align:start position:0%
conduct elections in the state and it
 
03:53:36.469 --> 03:53:36.479 align:start position:0%
would be heading in the direction of
 
03:53:39.110 --> 03:53:39.120 align:start position:0%
nonpartisan elections very similar to
 
03:53:42.790 --> 03:53:42.800 align:start position:0%
what we do at Town elections now where
 
03:53:44.429 --> 03:53:44.439 align:start position:0%
you know people from whatever political
 
03:53:47.229 --> 03:53:47.239 align:start position:0%
iCal persuasion get on the ballot and
 
03:53:49.149 --> 03:53:49.159 align:start position:0%
the voters select the one that they want
 
03:53:52.189 --> 03:53:52.199 align:start position:0%
to serve as Selectmen or planning board
 
03:53:54.830 --> 03:53:54.840 align:start position:0%
member uh
 
03:53:57.189 --> 03:53:57.199 align:start position:0%
whatever this bill does have
 
03:53:59.950 --> 03:53:59.960 align:start position:0%
consequences from the standpoint of an
 
03:53:59.960 --> 03:54:01.429 align:start position:0%
consequences from the standpoint of an
election

03:54:01.429 --> 03:54:01.439 align:start position:0%
election
 
03:54:03.750 --> 03:54:03.760 align:start position:0%
administrator having a single ballot
 
03:54:05.550 --> 03:54:05.560 align:start position:0%
does not mean that there's going to be
 
03:54:07.950 --> 03:54:07.960 align:start position:0%
less paper because you're still going to
 
03:54:11.070 --> 03:54:11.080 align:start position:0%
have the same number of candidates maybe
 
03:54:13.110 --> 03:54:13.120 align:start position:0%
even more if Undeclared voters are
 
03:54:16.429 --> 03:54:16.439 align:start position:0%
allowed to participate uh on that ballot
 
03:54:18.670 --> 03:54:18.680 align:start position:0%
and so it would either be a very very
 
03:54:22.710 --> 03:54:22.720 align:start position:0%
long Ballot or multiple pages so I don't
 
03:54:23.670 --> 03:54:23.680 align:start position:0%
think that there would be a lot of
 
03:54:25.910 --> 03:54:25.920 align:start position:0%
savings uh in that
 
03:54:27.990 --> 03:54:28.000 align:start position:0%
department and then there could also be
 
03:54:30.389 --> 03:54:30.399 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences representative
 
03:54:35.030 --> 03:54:35.040 align:start position:0%
Reed uh did a good job explaining how
 
03:54:39.510 --> 03:54:39.520 align:start position:0%
uh a community that is heavily uh
 
03:54:42.229 --> 03:54:42.239 align:start position:0%
belonging to one party could dominate
 
03:54:44.950 --> 03:54:44.960 align:start position:0%
the ballot and the other the reverse of
 
03:54:47.910 --> 03:54:47.920 align:start position:0%
that could be true if you had a number
 
03:54:51.590 --> 03:54:51.600 align:start position:0%
of uh of candidates from one party and
 
03:54:54.750 --> 03:54:54.760 align:start position:0%
just one or two of the other party where
 
03:54:58.630 --> 03:54:58.640 align:start position:0%
the many candidate uh gets deluded and
 
03:55:01.469 --> 03:55:01.479 align:start position:0%
and the two minority candidates might uh
 
03:55:03.510 --> 03:55:03.520 align:start position:0%
survive the
 
03:55:07.670 --> 03:55:07.680 align:start position:0%
primary and then what happens after the
 
03:55:10.070 --> 03:55:10.080 align:start position:0%
election's over and comes time to
 
03:55:12.550 --> 03:55:12.560 align:start position:0%
prepare the general election ballot when
 
03:55:16.269 --> 03:55:16.279 align:start position:0%
you have let's say two members of One
 
03:55:18.550 --> 03:55:18.560 align:start position:0%
party that won the primary and no
 
03:55:20.790 --> 03:55:20.800 align:start position:0%
members of the other party and you still
 
03:55:24.110 --> 03:55:24.120 align:start position:0%
have party columns um how does that how
 
03:55:27.870 --> 03:55:27.880 align:start position:0%
does that ballot configuration look um
 
03:55:29.389 --> 03:55:29.399 align:start position:0%
you know I think that would require some
 
03:55:34.309 --> 03:55:34.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:37.870 --> 03:55:37.880 align:start position:0%
out so I think uh those would be the
 
03:55:39.469 --> 03:55:39.479 align:start position:0%
concerns that I have Mr chair I'd be

03:55:48.750 --> 03:55:48.760 align:start position:0%
Gilmore Dave have you ever looked at any
 
03:55:50.870 --> 03:55:50.880 align:start position:0%
of the California Alaska Nebraska
 
03:55:54.790 --> 03:55:54.800 align:start position:0%
Washington Singo I just if you have just
 
03:55:56.950 --> 03:55:56.960 align:start position:0%
cares I've looked at California
 
03:55:59.510 --> 03:55:59.520 align:start position:0%
California on a regular basis goes
 
03:56:02.389 --> 03:56:02.399 align:start position:0%
through a primary and ends up with
 
03:56:03.950 --> 03:56:03.960 align:start position:0%
candidates on the general election that
 
03:56:06.990 --> 03:56:07.000 align:start position:0%
are just from that one party that won
 
03:56:09.269 --> 03:56:09.279 align:start position:0%
okay and you know if you're if you are
 
03:56:11.030 --> 03:56:11.040 align:start position:0%
let's say that happens you have two
 
03:56:13.189 --> 03:56:13.199 align:start position:0%
Democrats that win and they're running
 
03:56:15.110 --> 03:56:15.120 align:start position:0%
against each other in the en
 
03:56:17.990 --> 03:56:18.000 align:start position:0%
election the Republicans in that
 
03:56:19.910 --> 03:56:19.920 align:start position:0%
District are kind of disenfranchised
 
03:56:22.670 --> 03:56:22.680 align:start position:0%
because they wouldn't have uh somebody
 
03:56:24.349 --> 03:56:24.359 align:start position:0%
on the ballot that
 
03:56:26.469 --> 03:56:26.479 align:start position:0%
represents you know their
 
03:56:30.630 --> 03:56:30.640 align:start position:0%
viewpoints uh in a general election uh
 
03:56:31.990 --> 03:56:32.000 align:start position:0%
thank you further questions from the
 
03:56:35.990 --> 03:56:36.000 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none thank you this qu
 
03:56:37.710 --> 03:56:37.720 align:start position:0%
from you Mr wilh or did you receive a
 
03:56:37.720 --> 03:56:39.030 align:start position:0%
from you Mr wilh or did you receive a
text

03:56:39.030 --> 03:56:39.040 align:start position:0%
text
 
03:56:42.269 --> 03:56:42.279 align:start position:0%
message I I've got a question oh okay
 
03:56:44.309 --> 03:56:44.319 align:start position:0%
okay well we'll allow it I miss should
 
03:56:47.110 --> 03:56:47.120 align:start position:0%
to hear Mr secretary do you could you
 
03:56:51.670 --> 03:56:51.680 align:start position:0%
just talk about the administration of a
 
03:56:54.309 --> 03:56:54.319 align:start position:0%
primary like this like what what
 
03:56:56.710 --> 03:56:56.720 align:start position:0%
challenges do you see would it is it
 
03:56:58.149 --> 03:56:58.159 align:start position:0%
something that you could do or what what
 
03:57:00.510 --> 03:57:00.520 align:start position:0%
are some of the changes to statutes that
 
03:57:02.070 --> 03:57:02.080 align:start position:0%
you think would need to be made in order
 
03:57:04.469 --> 03:57:04.479 align:start position:0%
to execute something like this it would
 
03:57:07.790 --> 03:57:07.800 align:start position:0%
require quite a bit of thought
 
03:57:11.030 --> 03:57:11.040 align:start position:0%
um we would have many more candidates
 
03:57:14.309 --> 03:57:14.319 align:start position:0%
running in the primary when you're in
 
03:57:16.590 --> 03:57:16.600 align:start position:0%
erating all the candidates from both
 
03:57:19.750 --> 03:57:19.760 align:start position:0%
parties and maybe maybe other parties uh
 
03:57:22.630 --> 03:57:22.640 align:start position:0%
were Undeclared that want to run uh we
 
03:57:24.349 --> 03:57:24.359 align:start position:0%
would have to come up with a fair
 
03:57:27.309 --> 03:57:27.319 align:start position:0%
rotation scheme uh which we had talked
 
03:57:30.710 --> 03:57:30.720 align:start position:0%
about earlier today and then try and
 
03:57:33.269 --> 03:57:33.279 align:start position:0%
figure out how that would work along
 
03:57:35.510 --> 03:57:35.520 align:start position:0%
with their party affiliations would they
 
03:57:38.030 --> 03:57:38.040 align:start position:0%
be listed on the ballot um how would
 
03:57:38.040 --> 03:57:38.870 align:start position:0%
be listed on the ballot um how would
that

03:57:38.870 --> 03:57:38.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:57:38.880 --> 03:57:42.950 align:start position:0%
that
work

03:57:42.950 --> 03:57:42.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:46.550 --> 03:57:46.560 align:start position:0%
um yeah I mean they would be primarily
 
03:57:48.389 --> 03:57:48.399 align:start position:0%
ballot layout
 
03:57:50.630 --> 03:57:50.640 align:start position:0%
issues okay all right further questions
 
03:57:51.510 --> 03:57:51.520 align:start position:0%

04:02:55.229 --> 04:02:55.239 align:start position:0%
open up the public hearing on House Bill
 
04:02:58.269 --> 04:02:58.279 align:start position:0%
154 and recognize representative C for
 
04:03:32.469 --> 04:03:32.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:35.630 --> 04:03:35.640 align:start position:0%
reprentative C you ready to rock yes uh
 
04:03:37.790 --> 04:03:37.800 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and uh members of
 
04:03:39.710 --> 04:03:39.720 align:start position:0%
the House election law committee I'm
 
04:03:41.910 --> 04:03:41.920 align:start position:0%
representative Alvin C of lden
 
04:03:43.950 --> 04:03:43.960 align:start position:0%
representing eight towns in marac County
 
04:03:43.960 --> 04:03:44.830 align:start position:0%
representing eight towns in marac County
District

04:03:44.830 --> 04:03:44.840 align:start position:0%
District
 
04:03:47.469 --> 04:03:47.479 align:start position:0%
26 I'm here today to introduce House
 
04:03:50.149 --> 04:03:50.159 align:start position:0%
Bill 154 an act enabling voters to
 
04:03:52.790 --> 04:03:52.800 align:start position:0%
request to have their ballots hand
 
04:03:55.189 --> 04:03:55.199 align:start position:0%
counted this bill is quite
 
04:03:56.710 --> 04:03:56.720 align:start position:0%
straightforward in that it makes it
 
04:03:58.750 --> 04:03:58.760 align:start position:0%
clear that the legislature allows for
 
04:04:00.830 --> 04:04:00.840 align:start position:0%
some individual voters to choose to have
 
04:04:03.550 --> 04:04:03.560 align:start position:0%
their ballot to be hand counted and that
 
04:04:05.189 --> 04:04:05.199 align:start position:0%
they can do so without forcing an
 
04:04:07.510 --> 04:04:07.520 align:start position:0%
overvote for the ballot counting device
 
04:04:07.520 --> 04:04:08.389 align:start position:0%
overvote for the ballot counting device
to

04:04:08.389 --> 04:04:08.399 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:04:10.790 --> 04:04:10.800 align:start position:0%
reject resulting in a hand-counted
 
04:04:10.800 --> 04:04:11.990 align:start position:0%
reject resulting in a hand-counted
ballot

04:04:11.990 --> 04:04:12.000 align:start position:0%
ballot
 
04:04:14.670 --> 04:04:14.680 align:start position:0%
anyway there was some confusion at last
 
04:04:16.990 --> 04:04:17.000 align:start position:0%
state election that when a memo was sent
 
04:04:19.670 --> 04:04:19.680 align:start position:0%
to the moderators across the state from
 
04:04:22.910 --> 04:04:22.920 align:start position:0%
the uh attorney general and Secretary of
 
04:04:26.229 --> 04:04:26.239 align:start position:0%
State uh saying that the moderators
 
04:04:29.389 --> 04:04:29.399 align:start position:0%
would have to take names and Report uh
 
04:04:31.389 --> 04:04:31.399 align:start position:0%
those who asked to have their ballot
 
04:04:35.429 --> 04:04:35.439 align:start position:0%
hand counted so this is to clarify that
 
04:04:38.550 --> 04:04:38.560 align:start position:0%
the um that it is a permissible thing
 
04:04:40.229 --> 04:04:40.239 align:start position:0%
for people to
 
04:04:40.239 --> 04:04:42.070 align:start position:0%
for people to
do

04:04:42.070 --> 04:04:42.080 align:start position:0%
do
 
04:04:44.790 --> 04:04:44.800 align:start position:0%
um and I think for considering this bill
 
04:04:46.750 --> 04:04:46.760 align:start position:0%
and I have I'll take questions if there
 
04:04:48.550 --> 04:04:48.560 align:start position:0%
are any are there questions from the
 
04:04:51.149 --> 04:04:51.159 align:start position:0%
committee representative Bay thank you
 
04:04:53.309 --> 04:04:53.319 align:start position:0%
Mr chair thank you for taking my
 
04:04:56.550 --> 04:04:56.560 align:start position:0%
question so would this uh request also
 
04:04:59.469 --> 04:04:59.479 align:start position:0%
be available for uh those who requested
 
04:05:02.910 --> 04:05:02.920 align:start position:0%
absentee ballots and how would they do
 
04:05:05.550 --> 04:05:05.560 align:start position:0%
that uh thank you for the question for
 
04:05:08.750 --> 04:05:08.760 align:start position:0%
absentee ballots
 
04:05:12.870 --> 04:05:12.880 align:start position:0%
um there is not a provision for doing
 
04:05:15.070 --> 04:05:15.080 align:start position:0%
that so
 
04:05:18.910 --> 04:05:18.920 align:start position:0%
um and that's not included in this bill
 
04:05:22.349 --> 04:05:22.359 align:start position:0%
I did not consider that uh possibility
 
04:05:25.469 --> 04:05:25.479 align:start position:0%
normally those ballots would just be uh
 
04:05:27.110 --> 04:05:27.120 align:start position:0%
when they process them just fed through
 
04:05:29.149 --> 04:05:29.159 align:start position:0%
the machine unless there is happens to
 
04:05:31.630 --> 04:05:31.640 align:start position:0%
be an overvote on them in which case
 
04:05:32.910 --> 04:05:32.920 align:start position:0%
they would have to be put in the
 
04:05:35.990 --> 04:05:36.000 align:start position:0%
auxiliary compartment for hand counting
 
04:05:39.950 --> 04:05:39.960 align:start position:0%
later follow up yeah most do you think
 
04:05:41.950 --> 04:05:41.960 align:start position:0%
that should also that provision should
 
04:05:43.630 --> 04:05:43.640 align:start position:0%
also be available for those who vote
 
04:05:43.640 --> 04:05:46.550 align:start position:0%
also be available for those who vote
both

04:05:46.550 --> 04:05:46.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:49.469 --> 04:05:49.479 align:start position:0%
absentee I don't know that it's really
 
04:05:51.110 --> 04:05:51.120 align:start position:0%
that necessary because I think the
 
04:05:54.990 --> 04:05:55.000 align:start position:0%
people who are likely to be the ones
 
04:05:56.510 --> 04:05:56.520 align:start position:0%
asking to have their ballot handc
 
04:05:58.590 --> 04:05:58.600 align:start position:0%
counted are also likely to be people who
 
04:06:02.630 --> 04:06:02.640 align:start position:0%
would be in person voters but there's no
 
04:06:04.110 --> 04:06:04.120 align:start position:0%
reason not to
 
04:06:06.790 --> 04:06:06.800 align:start position:0%
consider um having a provision
 
04:06:09.349 --> 04:06:09.359 align:start position:0%
unfortunately you'd have to change
 
04:06:09.359 --> 04:06:11.149 align:start position:0%
unfortunately you'd have to change
the

04:06:11.149 --> 04:06:11.159 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:06:14.269 --> 04:06:14.279 align:start position:0%
um absentee ballot application
 
04:06:16.189 --> 04:06:16.199 align:start position:0%
and maybe some other provisions of law
 
04:06:19.189 --> 04:06:19.199 align:start position:0%
to be able to accommodate
 
04:06:21.070 --> 04:06:21.080 align:start position:0%
that further questions from the
 
04:06:23.510 --> 04:06:23.520 align:start position:0%
committee representative
 
04:06:26.030 --> 04:06:26.040 align:start position:0%
flan are are you familiar with the
 
04:06:28.510 --> 04:06:28.520 align:start position:0%
numerous studies that have been done
 
04:06:30.950 --> 04:06:30.960 align:start position:0%
that hand counting is actually more
 
04:06:34.550 --> 04:06:34.560 align:start position:0%
subject to error than machine counting I
 
04:06:38.030 --> 04:06:38.040 align:start position:0%
haven't necessarily uh seen all the
 
04:06:42.189 --> 04:06:42.199 align:start position:0%
studies but having uh been a uh an
 
04:06:45.910 --> 04:06:45.920 align:start position:0%
observer at recounts on quite a few uh
 
04:06:48.870 --> 04:06:48.880 align:start position:0%
different recount sessions now uh I'm
 
04:06:51.910 --> 04:06:51.920 align:start position:0%
quite familiar that the hand count towns
 
04:06:53.950 --> 04:06:53.960 align:start position:0%
usually have more errors than the
 
04:06:56.309 --> 04:06:56.319 align:start position:0%
machine count towns and could I have a
 
04:06:58.030 --> 04:06:58.040 align:start position:0%
followup yeah as no one else has one
 
04:07:02.429 --> 04:07:02.439 align:start position:0%
yeah follow uh are you concerned at all
 
04:07:05.429 --> 04:07:05.439 align:start position:0%
that this might slow down getting
 
04:07:08.550 --> 04:07:08.560 align:start position:0%
results if if a lot of people do this
 
04:07:12.110 --> 04:07:12.120 align:start position:0%
particularly in towns like Manchester or
 
04:07:15.870 --> 04:07:15.880 align:start position:0%
uh I guess Dairy is town uh it could
 
04:07:18.309 --> 04:07:18.319 align:start position:0%
really slow down
 
04:07:21.269 --> 04:07:21.279 align:start position:0%
results it it can slow things down but I
 
04:07:23.149 --> 04:07:23.159 align:start position:0%
think it slows it down even more when
 
04:07:26.550 --> 04:07:26.560 align:start position:0%
people uh deliberately put an overvote
 
04:07:29.870 --> 04:07:29.880 align:start position:0%
on their ballot so then uh in the
 
04:07:32.030 --> 04:07:32.040 align:start position:0%
process of going through because the
 
04:07:34.469 --> 04:07:34.479 align:start position:0%
overv vote ballots have to be handc
 
04:07:36.790 --> 04:07:36.800 align:start position:0%
counted anyway that's a separate
 
04:07:39.990 --> 04:07:40.000 align:start position:0%
provision uh it
 
04:07:43.630 --> 04:07:43.640 align:start position:0%
just uh it about all it really shows is
 
04:07:45.030 --> 04:07:45.040 align:start position:0%
that there are some people who don't
 
04:07:47.710 --> 04:07:47.720 align:start position:0%
like the idea of using
 
04:07:50.469 --> 04:07:50.479 align:start position:0%
machines further questions from the
 
04:07:53.670 --> 04:07:53.680 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none thank you um next
 
04:07:54.830 --> 04:07:54.840 align:start position:0%
up is I'm having trouble reading the
 
04:07:56.229 --> 04:07:56.239 align:start position:0%
last name but
 
04:07:59.590 --> 04:07:59.600 align:start position:0%
John cine I give about the as someone
 
04:08:03.149 --> 04:08:03.159 align:start position:0%
who also has not great handwriting I I I
 
04:08:05.950 --> 04:08:05.960 align:start position:0%
I you I do I mean if you saw mine you
 
04:08:07.309 --> 04:08:07.319 align:start position:0%
would understand that that was not meant
 
04:08:11.510 --> 04:08:11.520 align:start position:0%
with with uh any sort of criticism you
 
04:08:13.670 --> 04:08:13.680 align:start position:0%
said Co cawthorne
 
04:08:18.229 --> 04:08:18.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:22.389 --> 04:08:22.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:24.309 --> 04:08:24.319 align:start position:0%
you okay first thing you have to is
 
04:08:26.550 --> 04:08:26.560 align:start position:0%
press the button in front of you there
 
04:08:28.309 --> 04:08:28.319 align:start position:0%
you go and hold it down that nope you
 
04:08:29.950 --> 04:08:29.960 align:start position:0%
just you let it go fine and and we will
 
04:08:31.510 --> 04:08:31.520 align:start position:0%
be gentle I promise okay so I've never
 
04:08:32.830 --> 04:08:32.840 align:start position:0%
testified in front of a committee before
 
04:08:34.710 --> 04:08:34.720 align:start position:0%
so I'm new at this my name is John KRON
 
04:08:37.189 --> 04:08:37.199 align:start position:0%
I'm the moderator for w N9 and ASA I'm
 
04:08:38.710 --> 04:08:38.720 align:start position:0%
also a senior software analyst for a
 
04:08:40.950 --> 04:08:40.960 align:start position:0%
software company I'm testifying support
 
04:08:43.550 --> 04:08:43.560 align:start position:0%
of this bill because as moderator um
 
04:08:45.389 --> 04:08:45.399 align:start position:0%
I've seen an increase I've presided over
 
04:08:47.670 --> 04:08:47.680 align:start position:0%
three elections since I was elected and
 
04:08:49.429 --> 04:08:49.439 align:start position:0%
there's an increasingly large portion of
 
04:08:50.910 --> 04:08:50.920 align:start position:0%
the population in my experience that
 
04:08:52.309 --> 04:08:52.319 align:start position:0%
doesn't trust our elections doesn't
 
04:08:54.830 --> 04:08:54.840 align:start position:0%
trust the machines and they want their
 
04:08:56.710 --> 04:08:56.720 align:start position:0%
ballots hand counted it's because they
 
04:08:58.189 --> 04:08:58.199 align:start position:0%
believe the human interaction with the
 
04:08:59.590 --> 04:08:59.600 align:start position:0%
ballot would be more thorough than the
 
04:09:01.309 --> 04:09:01.319 align:start position:0%
machine interaction with the ballot
 
04:09:02.630 --> 04:09:02.640 align:start position:0%
which they feel as though the machine is
 
04:09:04.950 --> 04:09:04.960 align:start position:0%
not always accurate as far as Contin
 
04:09:05.870 --> 04:09:05.880 align:start position:0%
these at the end of the night there's
 
04:09:07.670 --> 04:09:07.680 align:start position:0%
such a small portion of these ballots
 
04:09:09.870 --> 04:09:09.880 align:start position:0%
maybe 10 15 20 and we have to count the
 
04:09:11.630 --> 04:09:11.640 align:start position:0%
uaba ballots to put in hands slaught
 
04:09:14.030 --> 04:09:14.040 align:start position:0%
anyways this is no burden on workers
 
04:09:15.269 --> 04:09:15.279 align:start position:0%
it's no burden on the election it
 
04:09:17.149 --> 04:09:17.159 align:start position:0%
doesn't take any longer I don't know how
 
04:09:18.070 --> 04:09:18.080 align:start position:0%
many of you are familiar with the
 
04:09:20.510 --> 04:09:20.520 align:start position:0%
election process as it is but we count
 
04:09:22.149 --> 04:09:22.159 align:start position:0%
all the ballots before the election and
 
04:09:23.309 --> 04:09:23.319 align:start position:0%
on Election night we take them all out
 
04:09:24.830 --> 04:09:24.840 align:start position:0%
of the tabulator we count them all again
 
04:09:27.670 --> 04:09:27.680 align:start position:0%
so we're counting 5,500 ballots at least
 
04:09:29.830 --> 04:09:29.840 align:start position:0%
in the last election of my ward anyways
 
04:09:31.990 --> 04:09:32.000 align:start position:0%
so if this increases voter confidence
 
04:09:33.389 --> 04:09:33.399 align:start position:0%
that their vote is actually being
 
04:09:35.269 --> 04:09:35.279 align:start position:0%
counted as the way they intended and
 
04:09:36.670 --> 04:09:36.680 align:start position:0%
doesn't put any strain on my election
 
04:09:38.910 --> 04:09:38.920 align:start position:0%
workers I see no problem with this bill
 
04:09:41.149 --> 04:09:41.159 align:start position:0%
whatsoever and I think I would encourage
 
04:09:43.630 --> 04:09:43.640 align:start position:0%
it okay uh will you be taking questions
 
04:09:45.710 --> 04:09:45.720 align:start position:0%
from the committee yes okay are there
 
04:09:47.750 --> 04:09:47.760 align:start position:0%
questions from the
 
04:09:49.870 --> 04:09:49.880 align:start position:0%
committee okay oh yes representative P
 
04:09:52.309 --> 04:09:52.319 align:start position:0%
O'Brien where dairy is a town yeah
 
04:09:56.269 --> 04:09:56.279 align:start position:0%
that's right are you aware of of any
 
04:09:58.269 --> 04:09:58.279 align:start position:0%
people or have you heard that people are
 
04:10:00.710 --> 04:10:00.720 align:start position:0%
are over voting purposefully so that
 
04:10:02.469 --> 04:10:02.479 align:start position:0%
their ballot will be counted have you
 
04:10:04.950 --> 04:10:04.960 align:start position:0%
heard that I have not heard of that
 
04:10:06.109 --> 04:10:06.119 align:start position:0%
because the machine rejects the
 
04:10:08.349 --> 04:10:08.359 align:start position:0%
overvotes so at least in Nashville the
 
04:10:09.670 --> 04:10:09.680 align:start position:0%
tabulators we're using if there's an
 
04:10:12.149 --> 04:10:12.159 align:start position:0%
overvote it's rejected so we don't
 
04:10:13.750 --> 04:10:13.760 align:start position:0%
accept overvotes they get that that
 
04:10:16.389 --> 04:10:16.399 align:start position:0%
ballots voided and they get another
 
04:10:18.670 --> 04:10:18.680 align:start position:0%
ballot further questions from the
 
04:10:22.030 --> 04:10:22.040 align:start position:0%
committee representative Wei yeah just a
 
04:10:24.710 --> 04:10:24.720 align:start position:0%

04:10:25.990 --> 04:10:26.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
04:10:28.070 --> 04:10:28.080 align:start position:0%
my question uh representative C
 
04:10:29.990 --> 04:10:30.000 align:start position:0%
mentioned a memorandum that came from
 
04:10:32.349 --> 04:10:32.359 align:start position:0%
the state did did you as a moderator in
 
04:10:34.910 --> 04:10:34.920 align:start position:0%
Nashwood receive such a memorandum yes I
 
04:10:36.550 --> 04:10:36.560 align:start position:0%
received a memorandum and I refused to
 
04:10:38.349 --> 04:10:38.359 align:start position:0%
comply with it we actually uh the ward
 
04:10:41.630 --> 04:10:41.640 align:start position:0%
Clerk and my Emily ad seak my w clerk
 
04:10:43.670 --> 04:10:43.680 align:start position:0%
confronted people that wanted their
 
04:10:45.030 --> 04:10:45.040 align:start position:0%
encountered and wanted to take their
 
04:10:46.710 --> 04:10:46.720 align:start position:0%
information report them I prevented her
 
04:10:48.309 --> 04:10:48.319 align:start position:0%
from doing that informed everyone in my
 
04:10:50.189 --> 04:10:50.199 align:start position:0%
ward that at least in ward nine we're
 
04:10:51.910 --> 04:10:51.920 align:start position:0%
not going to uh conformed to that order
 
04:10:53.950 --> 04:10:53.960 align:start position:0%
by the Secretary of State this is not
 
04:10:55.550 --> 04:10:55.560 align:start position:0%
Nazi Germany this is United States we
 
04:10:56.870 --> 04:10:56.880 align:start position:0%
should not be taking people's
 
04:10:58.790 --> 04:10:58.800 align:start position:0%
information who just want to vote so we
 
04:11:03.550 --> 04:11:03.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:03.560 --> 04:11:05.269 align:start position:0%
 
comply

04:11:05.269 --> 04:11:05.279 align:start position:0%
comply
 
04:11:08.510 --> 04:11:08.520 align:start position:0%
okay representative n thank you Mr
 
04:11:09.469 --> 04:11:09.479 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking the
 
04:11:12.910 --> 04:11:12.920 align:start position:0%
question um back to the overvote issue
 
04:11:17.229 --> 04:11:17.239 align:start position:0%
when there's an overvote on One race out
 
04:11:20.870 --> 04:11:20.880 align:start position:0%
of many does it reject the entire Ballot
 
04:11:23.349 --> 04:11:23.359 align:start position:0%
or does it count all of those others
 
04:11:25.309 --> 04:11:25.319 align:start position:0%
races where there's no overvote it
 
04:11:26.950 --> 04:11:26.960 align:start position:0%
rejects the ballot in its entirety and
 
04:11:28.750 --> 04:11:28.760 align:start position:0%
we have to void the ballot and give the
 
04:11:30.070 --> 04:11:30.080 align:start position:0%
voter a new
 
04:11:33.030 --> 04:11:33.040 align:start position:0%
ballot so if there's three um just say
 
04:11:35.229 --> 04:11:35.239 align:start position:0%
it says there's five candidates pick two
 
04:11:37.550 --> 04:11:37.560 align:start position:0%
and they pick three the ballots rejected
 
04:11:39.109 --> 04:11:39.119 align:start position:0%
so that means that ballot is not counted
 
04:11:40.550 --> 04:11:40.560 align:start position:0%
at all no race in that ballot has
 
04:11:41.670 --> 04:11:41.680 align:start position:0%
counted it never goes through the
 
04:11:43.870 --> 04:11:43.880 align:start position:0%
tabulator it's rejected back to us and
 
04:11:46.349 --> 04:11:46.359 align:start position:0%
it says so on the readout of the
 
04:11:48.990 --> 04:11:49.000 align:start position:0%
tabulator further questions from the
 
04:11:51.349 --> 04:11:51.359 align:start position:0%
committee see none thank you can I have
 
04:11:52.870 --> 04:11:52.880 align:start position:0%
one other comment about the over thing I
 
04:11:54.510 --> 04:11:54.520 align:start position:0%
think what might be confusing here is
 
04:11:56.950 --> 04:11:56.960 align:start position:0%
that there's writing campaigns to make
 
04:11:58.870 --> 04:11:58.880 align:start position:0%
sure that we there votes are handc
 
04:12:01.070 --> 04:12:01.080 align:start position:0%
counted as well so people will fill in
 
04:12:03.469 --> 04:12:03.479 align:start position:0%
right in B right in spots because those
 
04:12:04.830 --> 04:12:04.840 align:start position:0%
are hand counted in every single
 
04:12:06.349 --> 04:12:06.359 align:start position:0%
election because the machine can't read
 
04:12:08.229 --> 04:12:08.239 align:start position:0%
them so that might be what's actually
 
04:12:11.070 --> 04:12:11.080 align:start position:0%
occurring we have a lot of right in
 
04:12:13.469 --> 04:12:13.479 align:start position:0%
votes um further questions from the
 
04:12:16.269 --> 04:12:16.279 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none thank you um last
 
04:12:18.630 --> 04:12:18.640 align:start position:0%
up is Al brandano um representative
 
04:12:20.189 --> 04:12:20.199 align:start position:0%
gusovsky if you could grab that blue
 
04:12:31.070 --> 04:12:31.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:33.590 --> 04:12:33.600 align:start position:0%
great Alber Deno Kensington New
 
04:12:36.710 --> 04:12:36.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh I'm in support of this bill
 
04:12:39.710 --> 04:12:39.720 align:start position:0%
uh one to clarify a point today about uh
 
04:12:43.510 --> 04:12:43.520 align:start position:0%
hand count um there is no peir review St
 
04:12:45.790 --> 04:12:45.800 align:start position:0%
it's really dangerous when people make
 
04:12:48.269 --> 04:12:48.279 align:start position:0%
statements without a peer- review study
 
04:12:50.750 --> 04:12:50.760 align:start position:0%
uh on this subject matter so if we're
 
04:12:52.950 --> 04:12:52.960 align:start position:0%
going to accuse that one system is
 
04:12:54.630 --> 04:12:54.640 align:start position:0%
better than another it should be
 
04:12:55.990 --> 04:12:56.000 align:start position:0%
peer-reviewed and you should have the
 
04:12:57.870 --> 04:12:57.880 align:start position:0%
study so we all can understand what
 
04:13:00.630 --> 04:13:00.640 align:start position:0%
you're referring to uh secondly the
 
04:13:03.910 --> 04:13:03.920 align:start position:0%
Constitution calls for accuracy not
 
04:13:05.590 --> 04:13:05.600 align:start position:0%
efficiency the New Hampshire
 
04:13:07.590 --> 04:13:07.600 align:start position:0%
Constitution nor the US Constitution
 
04:13:09.790 --> 04:13:09.800 align:start position:0%
says something must be done within a
 
04:13:11.429 --> 04:13:11.439 align:start position:0%
certain period of time represent see if
 
04:13:12.429 --> 04:13:12.439 align:start position:0%
you guys can take your conversation
 
04:13:14.309 --> 04:13:14.319 align:start position:0%
outside you guys low rumbling voices we
 
04:13:17.550 --> 04:13:17.560 align:start position:0%
can't hear thank you um restart your
 
04:13:19.830 --> 04:13:19.840 align:start position:0%
stle Mr uh Brandon I apologize thank you
 
04:13:22.590 --> 04:13:22.600 align:start position:0%
sir um the Constitution calls for
 
04:13:25.830 --> 04:13:25.840 align:start position:0%
accuracy not efficiency we get uh pushed
 
04:13:28.189 --> 04:13:28.199 align:start position:0%
away from what our duty is uh especially
 
04:13:30.830 --> 04:13:30.840 align:start position:0%
Swan o of Duty that you swear to to
 
04:13:33.590 --> 04:13:33.600 align:start position:0%
defend the Constitution uh and in this
 
04:13:37.429 --> 04:13:37.439 align:start position:0%
case uh it's accuracy not efficiency um
 
04:13:39.309 --> 04:13:39.319 align:start position:0%
the third part is intimidation I can
 
04:13:41.590 --> 04:13:41.600 align:start position:0%
tell you about intimidation because one
 
04:13:44.070 --> 04:13:44.080 align:start position:0%
my town in Kensington the moderator
 
04:13:47.229 --> 04:13:47.239 align:start position:0%
chose to put people or threaten people
 
04:13:50.070 --> 04:13:50.080 align:start position:0%
not threaten I shouldn't say that uh but
 
04:13:51.990 --> 04:13:52.000 align:start position:0%
the the letter from the moderate the
 
04:13:53.630 --> 04:13:53.640 align:start position:0%
letter from the Secretary of State and
 
04:13:55.630 --> 04:13:55.640 align:start position:0%
the Attorney General was virtually
 
04:13:57.429 --> 04:13:57.439 align:start position:0%
intimidation it was put out two days
 
04:14:01.710 --> 04:14:01.720 align:start position:0%
before it was a memo and it said if you
 
04:14:03.790 --> 04:14:03.800 align:start position:0%
have your vote hand counted you can do
 
04:14:06.229 --> 04:14:06.239 align:start position:0%
it the moderator should allow it but if
 
04:14:07.750 --> 04:14:07.760 align:start position:0%
you do allow it you're going to be put
 
04:14:11.510 --> 04:14:11.520 align:start position:0%
on a list now that to me what list where
 
04:14:14.510 --> 04:14:14.520 align:start position:0%
does it go no one knows a memo is not a
 
04:14:17.670 --> 04:14:17.680 align:start position:0%
point of law a memo is just a memo so
 
04:14:20.349 --> 04:14:20.359 align:start position:0%
it's shameful that they use that tactic
 
04:14:22.469 --> 04:14:22.479 align:start position:0%
but a lot of people were frightened and
 
04:14:24.269 --> 04:14:24.279 align:start position:0%
referred to and what they did is they
 
04:14:26.950 --> 04:14:26.960 align:start position:0%
did what uh the moderator behind me just
 
04:14:29.790 --> 04:14:29.800 align:start position:0%
said is they wrote in their ballots they
 
04:14:31.870 --> 04:14:31.880 align:start position:0%
put in people's names and it got hand
 
04:14:33.590 --> 04:14:33.600 align:start position:0%
counted anyway because they were afraid
 
04:14:35.030 --> 04:14:35.040 align:start position:0%
of being put on the
 
04:14:39.109 --> 04:14:39.119 align:start position:0%
list I had 91 a with another person the
 
04:14:40.830 --> 04:14:40.840 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office to find out
 
04:14:43.149 --> 04:14:43.159 align:start position:0%
how many people were on the list and to
 
04:14:44.990 --> 04:14:45.000 align:start position:0%
the best of my knowledge it looks like
 
04:14:47.790 --> 04:14:47.800 align:start position:0%
at the time we did it was 25 to 28
 
04:14:50.710 --> 04:14:50.720 align:start position:0%
people so this is really quite a
 
04:14:52.790 --> 04:14:52.800 align:start position:0%
shameful event and we should be ashamed
 
04:14:55.109 --> 04:14:55.119 align:start position:0%
of ourselves for intimidating
 
04:14:55.119 --> 04:14:56.630 align:start position:0%
of ourselves for intimidating
voters

04:14:56.630 --> 04:14:56.640 align:start position:0%
voters
 
04:15:00.149 --> 04:15:00.159 align:start position:0%
uh and I'll take any questions okay are
 
04:15:02.109 --> 04:15:02.119 align:start position:0%
there questions from the committee
 
04:15:02.119 --> 04:15:03.670 align:start position:0%
there questions from the committee
representative

04:15:03.670 --> 04:15:03.680 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:15:06.510 --> 04:15:06.520 align:start position:0%
Grill um in terms of the the memo that
 
04:15:09.070 --> 04:15:09.080 align:start position:0%
was issued are you aware of any uh Court
 
04:15:11.830 --> 04:15:11.840 align:start position:0%
challenges uh it seems to me that that
 
04:15:14.630 --> 04:15:14.640 align:start position:0%
would violate voter privacy if you have
 
04:15:16.389 --> 04:15:16.399 align:start position:0%
a town of so many and only there believe
 
04:15:19.229 --> 04:15:19.239 align:start position:0%
it or not I don't we don't know why it
 
04:15:21.550 --> 04:15:21.560 align:start position:0%
was done that way but it was done that
 
04:15:23.229 --> 04:15:23.239 align:start position:0%
way it's it's public knowledge and it's
 
04:15:25.790 --> 04:15:25.800 align:start position:0%
in the evidence and there are people who
 
04:15:28.790 --> 04:15:28.800 align:start position:0%
are moving towards a lawsuit in my
 
04:15:30.830 --> 04:15:30.840 align:start position:0%
understanding against the Secretary of
 
04:15:32.670 --> 04:15:32.680 align:start position:0%
State and this is why and the Attorney
 
04:15:34.910 --> 04:15:34.920 align:start position:0%
General this is why having something
 
04:15:36.830 --> 04:15:36.840 align:start position:0%
like this so people aren't intimidated
 
04:15:39.229 --> 04:15:39.239 align:start position:0%
and can't be intimidated and like I say
 
04:15:42.469 --> 04:15:42.479 align:start position:0%
it's a small number of people but it you
 
04:15:44.510 --> 04:15:44.520 align:start position:0%
know if we allow students to vote with
 
04:15:47.550 --> 04:15:47.560 align:start position:0%
5-year-old IDs and we allow uh you know
 
04:15:49.269 --> 04:15:49.279 align:start position:0%
people who are residents but aren't
 
04:15:51.630 --> 04:15:51.640 align:start position:0%
residents and we allow all these things
 
04:15:53.349 --> 04:15:53.359 align:start position:0%
what's wrong with allowing someone to
 
04:15:55.590 --> 04:15:55.600 align:start position:0%
have their vote handc counted it and
 
04:15:56.830 --> 04:15:56.840 align:start position:0%
like I said there's an alternative way
 
04:15:59.389 --> 04:15:59.399 align:start position:0%
to do it by handwriting but that's
 
04:16:02.469 --> 04:16:02.479 align:start position:0%
really puts more work on the
 
04:16:05.550 --> 04:16:05.560 align:start position:0%
moderators further questions from the
 
04:16:07.910 --> 04:16:07.920 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none thank you um I
 
04:16:09.349 --> 04:16:09.359 align:start position:0%

04:16:50.469 --> 04:16:50.479 align:start position:0%
I guess I 15 minutes to kill so that's
 
04:16:53.670 --> 04:16:53.680 align:start position:0%
hasn't happened in a minute um I don't
 
04:16:55.149 --> 04:16:55.159 align:start position:0%
let's finish up our executive session
 
04:16:58.510 --> 04:16:58.520 align:start position:0%
like I said there's no more votes um so
 
04:17:00.990 --> 04:17:01.000 align:start position:0%
uh our going to reopen 423 does anybody
 
04:17:03.790 --> 04:17:03.800 align:start position:0%
else have the any any more having heard
 
04:17:05.309 --> 04:17:05.319 align:start position:0%
what everybody said about the political
 
04:17:06.710 --> 04:17:06.720 align:start position:0%
signs anybody have anything else they
 
04:17:08.030 --> 04:17:08.040 align:start position:0%
want to aine
 
04:17:11.149 --> 04:17:11.159 align:start position:0%
on we didn't get representative Grill's
 
04:17:13.990 --> 04:17:14.000 align:start position:0%
thoughts oh I apologize yes
 
04:17:15.950 --> 04:17:15.960 align:start position:0%
representative I am so sorry yes
 
04:17:17.389 --> 04:17:17.399 align:start position:0%
representative Grill what we need from
 
04:17:19.910 --> 04:17:19.920 align:start position:0%
you here is if you could write the
 
04:17:22.710 --> 04:17:22.720 align:start position:0%
political sign laws in New Hampshire as
 
04:17:24.510 --> 04:17:24.520 align:start position:0%
you saw fit and no one could stop you
 
04:17:27.070 --> 04:17:27.080 align:start position:0%
from doing it what would you do oh
 
04:17:31.149 --> 04:17:31.159 align:start position:0%
that's a scary question um I love signs
 
04:17:32.990 --> 04:17:33.000 align:start position:0%
the bigger the flashier the tackier the
 
04:17:34.950 --> 04:17:34.960 align:start position:0%
better put them all over the place no
 
04:17:37.950 --> 04:17:37.960 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm kidding I'm kidding um I think
 
04:17:40.790 --> 04:17:40.800 align:start position:0%
my concern is if we get into the realm
 
04:17:43.830 --> 04:17:43.840 align:start position:0%
of a budding
 
04:17:46.750 --> 04:17:46.760 align:start position:0%
um would that not
 
04:17:51.630 --> 04:17:51.640 align:start position:0%
be in in effect letting one um person
 
04:17:53.229 --> 04:17:53.239 align:start position:0%
who might not like a particular sign
 
04:17:55.790 --> 04:17:55.800 align:start position:0%
dictate what signs are placed on public
 
04:17:58.990 --> 04:17:59.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:02.070 --> 04:18:02.080 align:start position:0%
Property oh it's it's not a yeah this is
 
04:18:04.189 --> 04:18:04.199 align:start position:0%
literally your time to aine it's not a
 
04:18:06.429 --> 04:18:06.439 align:start position:0%
question and answer period no iess I
 
04:18:08.189 --> 04:18:08.199 align:start position:0%
guess I'm just curious about about that
 
04:18:10.510 --> 04:18:10.520 align:start position:0%
side so that's my concern
 
04:18:13.269 --> 04:18:13.279 align:start position:0%
um I mean signs are
 
04:18:16.870 --> 04:18:16.880 align:start position:0%
our speech in my opinion and should give
 
04:18:19.830 --> 04:18:19.840 align:start position:0%
people as many chances to have their
 
04:18:21.990 --> 04:18:22.000 align:start position:0%
voice heard and obviously don't go
 
04:18:24.149 --> 04:18:24.159 align:start position:0%
putting signs on people's private
 
04:18:26.750 --> 04:18:26.760 align:start position:0%
property without permission but I think
 
04:18:31.030 --> 04:18:31.040 align:start position:0%
if it's public or if it's a neighboring
 
04:18:33.550 --> 04:18:33.560 align:start position:0%
property then it should be fair game in
 
04:18:36.469 --> 04:18:36.479 align:start position:0%
my opinion so keep them keep the signs
 
04:18:39.990 --> 04:18:40.000 align:start position:0%
coming and you couldn't be more wrong no
 
04:18:41.469 --> 04:18:41.479 align:start position:0%
couldn't be
 
04:18:45.429 --> 04:18:45.439 align:start position:0%
more I have I yes representative L um I
 
04:18:48.349 --> 04:18:48.359 align:start position:0%
I had said I would just something about
 
04:18:51.109 --> 04:18:51.119 align:start position:0%
easements um to go back to uh
 
04:18:54.309 --> 04:18:54.319 align:start position:0%
representative nome's analogy um if you
 
04:18:57.269 --> 04:18:57.279 align:start position:0%
have a bundle of sticks when you give
 
04:18:59.990 --> 04:19:00.000 align:start position:0%
somebody an easement you're giving them
 
04:19:03.070 --> 04:19:03.080 align:start position:0%
one of your sticks and so depending on
 
04:19:05.269 --> 04:19:05.279 align:start position:0%
what the easement agreement says and
 
04:19:06.870 --> 04:19:06.880 align:start position:0%
that's where the state is where you get
 
04:19:09.189 --> 04:19:09.199 align:start position:0%
involved with the state you may or may
 
04:19:11.990 --> 04:19:12.000 align:start position:0%
not have the right to put signs up you
 
04:19:13.830 --> 04:19:13.840 align:start position:0%
may or may not have the right to use
 
04:19:16.910 --> 04:19:16.920 align:start position:0%
that or you may have rights to use it as
 
04:19:19.590 --> 04:19:19.600 align:start position:0%
you see fit so it depends on what the
 
04:19:22.229 --> 04:19:22.239 align:start position:0%
easement agreement says when whoever
 
04:19:24.990 --> 04:19:25.000 align:start position:0%
granted the easement to the state or the
 
04:19:27.790 --> 04:19:27.800 align:start position:0%
city for that sidewalk or that piece of
 
04:19:29.990 --> 04:19:30.000 align:start position:0%
land or whatever it is is going to be
 
04:19:32.429 --> 04:19:32.439 align:start position:0%
governed by the easement agreement and
 
04:19:34.950 --> 04:19:34.960 align:start position:0%
so um and if there's no easement
 
04:19:36.870 --> 04:19:36.880 align:start position:0%
agreement then it goes to common law and
 
04:19:38.670 --> 04:19:38.680 align:start position:0%
I have no idea what that says because I
 
04:19:40.950 --> 04:19:40.960 align:start position:0%
can't remember but aren't you an
 
04:19:44.309 --> 04:19:44.319 align:start position:0%
attorney no I used to be an attorney you
 
04:19:46.389 --> 04:19:46.399 align:start position:0%
never need legal advice don't call
 
04:19:49.389 --> 04:19:49.399 align:start position:0%
that's what she's saying um further
 
04:19:51.269 --> 04:19:51.279 align:start position:0%
conversations on this representative I
 
04:19:52.750 --> 04:19:52.760 align:start position:0%
said we're just we're just talking here
 
04:19:53.750 --> 04:19:53.760 align:start position:0%
so if you guys want to go to the
 
04:19:55.790 --> 04:19:55.800 align:start position:0%
bathroom or whatever I just I want to
 
04:19:57.269 --> 04:19:57.279 align:start position:0%
explore this I think I'm I think I'm
 
04:19:58.510 --> 04:19:58.520 align:start position:0%
coming to an idea of what I'm going to
 
04:20:00.469 --> 04:20:00.479 align:start position:0%
do but well I have a I have a further
 
04:20:02.469 --> 04:20:02.479 align:start position:0%
thought in response to your preference
 
04:20:05.750 --> 04:20:05.760 align:start position:0%
of no political signs on PR on public
 
04:20:08.149 --> 04:20:08.159 align:start position:0%
property and I believe that was also the
 
04:20:11.030 --> 04:20:11.040 align:start position:0%
preference of Representative Nome no
 
04:20:12.710 --> 04:20:12.720 align:start position:0%
signs on public property at all but
 
04:20:14.950 --> 04:20:14.960 align:start position:0%
except by permission of the municipality
 
04:20:17.550 --> 04:20:17.560 align:start position:0%
well I I guess I'm I'm okay with it
 
04:20:20.429 --> 04:20:20.439 align:start position:0%
being on State Property the way it is
 
04:20:24.309 --> 04:20:24.319 align:start position:0%
now it's giving the right to control to
 
04:20:26.630 --> 04:20:26.640 align:start position:0%
an private individual is where I have
 
04:20:29.149 --> 04:20:29.159 align:start position:0%
problems and
 
04:20:31.349 --> 04:20:31.359 align:start position:0%
I understand that my particular
 
04:20:33.790 --> 04:20:33.800 align:start position:0%
situation I described that would satisfy
 
04:20:37.149 --> 04:20:37.159 align:start position:0%
my concerns but Pro the the difficulty
 
04:20:40.189 --> 04:20:40.199 align:start position:0%
with as everything we we do here is
 
04:20:42.750 --> 04:20:42.760 align:start position:0%
having it enforced
 
04:20:45.790 --> 04:20:45.800 align:start position:0%
if the state enforced that if the state
 
04:20:48.510 --> 04:20:48.520 align:start position:0%
owned the property underneath its
 
04:20:51.510 --> 04:20:51.520 align:start position:0%
highway right of way and enforced no
 
04:20:54.030 --> 04:20:54.040 align:start position:0%
signs on state public property then that
 
04:20:56.269 --> 04:20:56.279 align:start position:0%
would suit me fine so that's all I just
 
04:20:59.189 --> 04:20:59.199 align:start position:0%
want to comment on that further comments
 
04:20:59.199 --> 04:21:00.429 align:start position:0%
want to comment on that further comments
questions

04:21:00.429 --> 04:21:00.439 align:start position:0%
questions
 
04:21:03.429 --> 04:21:03.439 align:start position:0%
concerns um okay so I think what I'm
 
04:21:09.269 --> 04:21:09.279 align:start position:0%
going to do is I'm gonna draft multiple
 
04:21:11.750 --> 04:21:11.760 align:start position:0%
amendments um cuz we can we can take up
 
04:21:14.030 --> 04:21:14.040 align:start position:0%
multiple amendments so I think what I'm
 
04:21:17.389 --> 04:21:17.399 align:start position:0%
going to do is try to divide the
 
04:21:20.269 --> 04:21:20.279 align:start position:0%
question as many ways as
 
04:21:24.070 --> 04:21:24.080 align:start position:0%
possible and um so like we'll do like
 
04:21:26.070 --> 04:21:26.080 align:start position:0%
one like total ban we'll start with like
 
04:21:28.990 --> 04:21:29.000 align:start position:0%
just towns like just towns so I'll bring
 
04:21:31.269 --> 04:21:31.279 align:start position:0%
up one that is just total ban in towns
 
04:21:33.349 --> 04:21:33.359 align:start position:0%
and towns can allow it where they want
 
04:21:36.670 --> 04:21:36.680 align:start position:0%
to allow it and we can vote on that how
 
04:21:39.030 --> 04:21:39.040 align:start position:0%
we want and if it fails it fails and
 
04:21:41.910 --> 04:21:41.920 align:start position:0%
it's adopted it's adopted um and then
 
04:21:44.790 --> 04:21:44.800 align:start position:0%
I'll think I'll do one with State uh
 
04:21:45.990 --> 04:21:46.000 align:start position:0%
right of
 
04:21:52.149 --> 04:21:52.159 align:start position:0%
ways where the a property owner can put
 
04:21:53.590 --> 04:21:53.600 align:start position:0%
it up so long as it doesn't interfere
 
04:21:58.910 --> 04:21:58.920 align:start position:0%
with traffic um but no one else can and
 
04:22:01.750 --> 04:22:01.760 align:start position:0%
then I'll do one with an
 
04:22:03.830 --> 04:22:03.840 align:start position:0%
adjoiner however I'm going to craft that
 
04:22:05.189 --> 04:22:05.199 align:start position:0%
that'll be a fun one to craft by the way
 
04:22:07.429 --> 04:22:07.439 align:start position:0%
that'll be a real fun one to craft um
 
04:22:08.590 --> 04:22:08.600 align:start position:0%
but basically what I'm saying is I think
 
04:22:09.790 --> 04:22:09.800 align:start position:0%
what I'm going to do is I'm going to try
 
04:22:11.990 --> 04:22:12.000 align:start position:0%
to chop it up like three ways four ways
 
04:22:14.710 --> 04:22:14.720 align:start position:0%
if I can figure fig it out and just let
 
04:22:15.910 --> 04:22:15.920 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
04:22:18.710 --> 04:22:18.720 align:start position:0%
vote and if it all fails we change
 
04:22:21.710 --> 04:22:21.720 align:start position:0%
nothing and if something passes we go
 
04:22:23.790 --> 04:22:23.800 align:start position:0%
with that route um because I think it's
 
04:22:24.750 --> 04:22:24.760 align:start position:0%
safe to
 
04:22:27.229 --> 04:22:27.239 align:start position:0%
say there's not a partisan issue unlik
 
04:22:28.389 --> 04:22:28.399 align:start position:0%
most things in election law it doesn't
 
04:22:29.990 --> 04:22:30.000 align:start position:0%
appear to be that there's one side
 
04:22:31.510 --> 04:22:31.520 align:start position:0%
advocating for the other right is that
 
04:22:33.109 --> 04:22:33.119 align:start position:0%
is that a fair statement it's kind of
 
04:22:34.429 --> 04:22:34.439 align:start position:0%
all over the place you've got Grill over
 
04:22:35.830 --> 04:22:35.840 align:start position:0%
there wants the more signs me with the
 
04:22:37.710 --> 04:22:37.720 align:start position:0%
no signs
 
04:22:40.630 --> 04:22:40.640 align:start position:0%
um so um I guess that's not a good
 
04:22:42.149 --> 04:22:42.159 align:start position:0%
example how about I want the no signs
 
04:22:43.950 --> 04:22:43.960 align:start position:0%
and Clayton represented wood wants all
 
04:22:45.030 --> 04:22:45.040 align:start position:0%
the signs so there you go that's a
 
04:22:47.109 --> 04:22:47.119 align:start position:0%
better example um so I think that's what
 
04:22:49.510 --> 04:22:49.520 align:start position:0%
I will do on that does anybody else have
 
04:22:53.189 --> 04:22:53.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:55.229 --> 04:22:55.239 align:start position:0%
that yeah yeah towns and cities together
 
04:22:57.510 --> 04:22:57.520 align:start position:0%
yeah the local the county I'll do County
 
04:22:59.149 --> 04:22:59.159 align:start position:0%
too I'll talk I'll toss County in there
 
04:23:02.070 --> 04:23:02.080 align:start position:0%
too um so does anybody does anybody have
 
04:23:03.510 --> 04:23:03.520 align:start position:0%
a better idea than that of a way to
 
04:23:05.790 --> 04:23:05.800 align:start position:0%
handle that and I guess I I dare say a
 
04:23:05.800 --> 04:23:07.109 align:start position:0%
handle that and I guess I I dare say a
democratic

04:23:07.109 --> 04:23:07.119 align:start position:0%
democratic
 
04:23:09.229 --> 04:23:09.239 align:start position:0%
process I was going to say just start
 
04:23:12.590 --> 04:23:12.600 align:start position:0%
with an itl yeah yeah you just kill well
 
04:23:13.910 --> 04:23:13.920 align:start position:0%
I I don't want to do that cuz then I
 
04:23:15.229 --> 04:23:15.239 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have killed the I would I
 
04:23:17.109 --> 04:23:17.119 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have killed the the one that is
 
04:23:19.030 --> 04:23:19.040 align:start position:0%
actually probably be more than more more
 
04:23:22.429 --> 04:23:22.439 align:start position:0%
relevant um that was 365 I think right
 
04:23:26.030 --> 04:23:26.040 align:start position:0%
was the first one um so no I I would
 
04:23:27.910 --> 04:23:27.920 align:start position:0%
rather just vote I think what I'm going
 
04:23:30.349 --> 04:23:30.359 align:start position:0%
do is I'm going to take like 365 tried
 
04:23:34.790 --> 04:23:34.800 align:start position:0%
to do slam it onto this change the
 
04:23:37.030 --> 04:23:37.040 align:start position:0%
language in here about a butter to ad
 
04:23:38.750 --> 04:23:38.760 align:start position:0%
joiners like that'll be an amendment
 
04:23:40.149 --> 04:23:40.159 align:start position:0%
changing the budding language to ad
 
04:23:41.229 --> 04:23:41.239 align:start position:0%
joining language I think I do think
 
04:23:43.229 --> 04:23:43.239 align:start position:0%
that's a better term
 
04:23:45.269 --> 04:23:45.279 align:start position:0%
joint yeah I think that's I think that's
 
04:23:47.030 --> 04:23:47.040 align:start position:0%
a better ter like regardless I think
 
04:23:48.389 --> 04:23:48.399 align:start position:0%
like like there's something that could
 
04:23:51.229 --> 04:23:51.239 align:start position:0%
actually happen like just the adjoining
 
04:23:52.750 --> 04:23:52.760 align:start position:0%
go AB budding going to ad joining could
 
04:23:56.349 --> 04:23:56.359 align:start position:0%
be a thing that happens um and then just
 
04:23:57.710 --> 04:23:57.720 align:start position:0%
work from there and who knows like you
 
04:23:59.349 --> 04:23:59.359 align:start position:0%
know maybe it all goes down and flames
 
04:24:00.429 --> 04:24:00.439 align:start position:0%
and then probably goes to the floor and
 
04:24:01.870 --> 04:24:01.880 align:start position:0%
just gets eviscerated on a bipartisan
 
04:24:03.750 --> 04:24:03.760 align:start position:0%
vote it'll be hilarious
 
04:24:07.229 --> 04:24:07.239 align:start position:0%
but so is anybody yes out representative
 
04:24:11.469 --> 04:24:11.479 align:start position:0%
C uh two things one you may want to uh
 
04:24:14.830 --> 04:24:14.840 align:start position:0%
consider areas along highways that are
 
04:24:16.750 --> 04:24:16.760 align:start position:0%
uh apparently unimproved
 
04:24:19.229 --> 04:24:19.239 align:start position:0%
properties uh you may not know who it
 
04:24:21.429 --> 04:24:21.439 align:start position:0%
belongs to but it's just Woods or Farm
 
04:24:23.710 --> 04:24:23.720 align:start position:0%
fields or something like that but the
 
04:24:27.510 --> 04:24:27.520 align:start position:0%
what I was going to uh suggest was
 
04:24:31.469 --> 04:24:31.479 align:start position:0%
before you get OS all tied up uh just
 
04:24:32.750 --> 04:24:32.760 align:start position:0%
bring in
 
04:24:36.030 --> 04:24:36.040 align:start position:0%
proposed uh proposals for LS uh for
 
04:24:38.950 --> 04:24:38.960 align:start position:0%
amendments and then we can do that
 
04:24:40.790 --> 04:24:40.800 align:start position:0%
that's just a suggestion yes well
 
04:24:41.670 --> 04:24:41.680 align:start position:0%
they're going to have two weeks because
 
04:24:42.990 --> 04:24:43.000 align:start position:0%
we're not going to be voting at all next
 
04:24:45.349 --> 04:24:45.359 align:start position:0%
week um so justway there's no votes next
 
04:24:47.830 --> 04:24:47.840 align:start position:0%
week um just hearings because it's
 
04:24:49.910 --> 04:24:49.920 align:start position:0%
school vacation weeks next week right so
 
04:24:52.149 --> 04:24:52.159 align:start position:0%
there will be only hearings next week so
 
04:24:53.910 --> 04:24:53.920 align:start position:0%
if you're out you're out um and if you
 
04:24:56.149 --> 04:24:56.159 align:start position:0%
need a question definitely definitely
 
04:24:57.710 --> 04:24:57.720 align:start position:0%
don't do what representative Mirad did
 
04:24:59.189 --> 04:24:59.199 align:start position:0%
and send it in real
 
04:25:01.070 --> 04:25:01.080 align:start position:0%
fast um if you're gonna send the if
 
04:25:02.269 --> 04:25:02.279 align:start position:0%
you're G to send the text message don't
 
04:25:04.269 --> 04:25:04.279 align:start position:0%
be don't wave the phone I'm just saying
 
04:25:07.510 --> 04:25:07.520 align:start position:0%
like it's too E I don't care don't be
 
04:25:09.309 --> 04:25:09.319 align:start position:0%
obvious U it was more I was more
 
04:25:10.670 --> 04:25:10.680 align:start position:0%
offended at the obvious nature of it
 
04:25:12.950 --> 04:25:12.960 align:start position:0%
than anything um
 
04:25:15.550 --> 04:25:15.560 align:start position:0%
so yeah so so there's no votes next week
 
04:25:17.910 --> 04:25:17.920 align:start position:0%
um so I guess I guess that that's my
 
04:25:18.870 --> 04:25:18.880 align:start position:0%
thing is it's like I don't know if I'll
 
04:25:20.309 --> 04:25:20.319 align:start position:0%
have time after that to grab their
 
04:25:21.830 --> 04:25:21.840 align:start position:0%
amendments but OLS will have two weeks
 
04:25:24.389 --> 04:25:24.399 align:start position:0%
to put together amendments
 
04:25:27.149 --> 04:25:27.159 align:start position:0%
um we've got seven more minutes is there
 
04:25:28.229 --> 04:25:28.239 align:start position:0%
any updates out of the sub commmittee
 
04:25:32.870 --> 04:25:32.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:36.070 --> 04:25:36.080 align:start position:0%
killed uh no we we looked we tried to
 
04:25:37.670 --> 04:25:37.680 align:start position:0%

04:25:41.030 --> 04:25:41.040 align:start position:0%
6543 all the bills pertaining to 65413
 
04:25:44.389 --> 04:25:44.399 align:start position:0%
we read through the very ious topics and
 
04:25:47.469 --> 04:25:47.479 align:start position:0%
we looked at the um there are four bills
 
04:25:49.550 --> 04:25:49.560 align:start position:0%
pertaining to 65413 we had some
 
04:25:51.349 --> 04:25:51.359 align:start position:0%
discussions we ended up killing that one
 
04:25:56.630 --> 04:25:56.640 align:start position:0%
and um you know we also received a memo
 
04:25:59.710 --> 04:25:59.720 align:start position:0%

04:26:01.790 --> 04:26:01.800 align:start position:0%
court cases so we'll be discussing those
 
04:26:02.710 --> 04:26:02.720 align:start position:0%

04:26:06.750 --> 04:26:06.760 align:start position:0%

04:26:24.590 --> 04:26:24.600 align:start position:0%
Henry Clement totz Clement totz um the
 
04:26:27.510 --> 04:26:27.520 align:start position:0%
American civil liberties Union yes sir

04:26:33.950 --> 04:26:33.960 align:start position:0%
their testimonies on this subject matter
 
04:26:35.990 --> 04:26:36.000 align:start position:0%
okay awesome all right well with that um
 
04:26:38.070 --> 04:26:38.080 align:start position:0%
I'm going to close the executive session
 
04:26:39.670 --> 04:26:39.680 align:start position:0%
on House Bill
 
04:26:42.030 --> 04:26:42.040 align:start position:0%
423 uh I'm going to open the executive
 
04:26:44.109 --> 04:26:44.119 align:start position:0%
session session for 154 we are recessing
 
04:26:46.510 --> 04:26:46.520 align:start position:0%
this I'm trying to get an amendment in
 
04:26:48.510 --> 04:26:48.520 align:start position:0%
but I can't ever find chance to file it
 
04:26:49.910 --> 04:26:49.920 align:start position:0%
but what I'm going to do just for
 
04:26:51.469 --> 04:26:51.479 align:start position:0%
situational awareness I don't think the
 
04:26:53.309 --> 04:26:53.319 align:start position:0%
ranking member is going to love this but
 
04:26:55.389 --> 04:26:55.399 align:start position:0%
that's what I'm going to do um is I'm
 
04:26:58.429 --> 04:26:58.439 align:start position:0%
going to uh I'm going to switch it over
 
04:27:02.309 --> 04:27:02.319 align:start position:0%
to a report that comes out uh 60 days
 
04:27:04.229 --> 04:27:04.239 align:start position:0%
out of the election accessible by the
 
04:27:06.469 --> 04:27:06.479 align:start position:0%
town because that's how we do lists most
 
04:27:10.670 --> 04:27:10.680 align:start position:0%
of these most of these we have yet to
 
04:27:13.070 --> 04:27:13.080 align:start position:0%
allow the
 
04:27:15.309 --> 04:27:15.319 align:start position:0%
general public to access the Statewide
 
04:27:19.189 --> 04:27:19.199 align:start position:0%
voter file um we allow candidates to do
 
04:27:20.750 --> 04:27:20.760 align:start position:0%
we allow Statewide candids do it we
 
04:27:21.990 --> 04:27:22.000 align:start position:0%
allow the parties to do it but we've
 
04:27:24.630 --> 04:27:24.640 align:start position:0%
never allowed an individual to go in and
 
04:27:26.550 --> 04:27:26.560 align:start position:0%
do it so I I personally just don't want
 
04:27:28.750 --> 04:27:28.760 align:start position:0%
to start that precedent um so I'm going
 
04:27:31.109 --> 04:27:31.119 align:start position:0%
to basically take their
 
04:27:35.790 --> 04:27:35.800 align:start position:0%
report shove it down to the town level
 
04:27:38.670 --> 04:27:38.680 align:start position:0%
um and then uh release the actual
 
04:27:40.429 --> 04:27:40.439 align:start position:0%
address but I I haven't decided yet if
 
04:27:41.830 --> 04:27:41.840 align:start position:0%
I'm going to have it tied to the voter
 
04:27:45.950 --> 04:27:45.960 align:start position:0%
or not um but I do think I I do want
 
04:27:47.349 --> 04:27:47.359 align:start position:0%
that address out
 
04:27:51.189 --> 04:27:51.199 align:start position:0%
there 60 days after the election okay so
 
04:27:54.229 --> 04:27:54.239 align:start position:0%
we're not talking about 158 right thank
 
04:27:56.349 --> 04:27:56.359 align:start position:0%
you okay yes we're talking about 158
 
04:27:58.550 --> 04:27:58.560 align:start position:0%
just wasn't I didn't I didn't switch
 
04:28:00.469 --> 04:28:00.479 align:start position:0%
gear F yeah sorry yeah yeah yeah I just
 
04:28:02.070 --> 04:28:02.080 align:start position:0%
wanted to let you know that like that
 
04:28:03.149 --> 04:28:03.159 align:start position:0%
that's what I'm I'm going to file
 
04:28:04.830 --> 04:28:04.840 align:start position:0%
something along those lines I just
 
04:28:06.630 --> 04:28:06.640 align:start position:0%
haven't had the chance to do it yet cuz
 
04:28:08.030 --> 04:28:08.040 align:start position:0%
as you can tell by me talking out loud
 
04:28:10.950 --> 04:28:10.960 align:start position:0%
I'm still on my brain kind of sorting it
 
04:28:12.349 --> 04:28:12.359 align:start position:0%
um but that's that's why we're not
 
04:28:14.349 --> 04:28:14.359 align:start position:0%
voting on that today so anyways um
 
04:28:15.550 --> 04:28:15.560 align:start position:0%
that's what I'm doing there any other
 
04:28:16.550 --> 04:28:16.560 align:start position:0%
comments on
 
04:28:19.469 --> 04:28:19.479 align:start position:0%

04:32:48.269 --> 04:32:48.279 align:start position:0%
election law committee for the record
 
04:32:50.710 --> 04:32:50.720 align:start position:0%
I'm representative Susan portelli
 
04:32:54.910 --> 04:32:54.920 align:start position:0%
Rockingham District 19 Hampton Falls and
 
04:32:57.030 --> 04:32:57.040 align:start position:0%
Kensington thank you for hearing my
 
04:33:01.710 --> 04:33:01.720 align:start position:0%
testimony on HB 693 to permit hand
 
04:33:04.470 --> 04:33:04.480 align:start position:0%
counting of ballots and to conduct a
 
04:33:07.230 --> 04:33:07.240 align:start position:0%
supplemental count of ballots at the
 
04:33:10.189 --> 04:33:10.199 align:start position:0%
discretion of the selectman or the town
 
04:33:13.990 --> 04:33:14.000 align:start position:0%
clerk the first objective of this bill
 
04:33:16.709 --> 04:33:16.719 align:start position:0%
is to permit a voter to present their
 
04:33:19.310 --> 04:33:19.320 align:start position:0%
ballot to the moderator for hand
 
04:33:23.429 --> 04:33:23.439 align:start position:0%
counting we just heard discussion on hb1
 
04:33:27.150 --> 04:33:27.160 align:start position:0%
154 to permit hand counting of ballots
 
04:33:30.070 --> 04:33:30.080 align:start position:0%
so I will reiterate the need for
 
04:33:32.269 --> 04:33:32.279 align:start position:0%
consistency through throughout the state
 
04:33:35.750 --> 04:33:35.760 align:start position:0%
to allow this process without the use of
 
04:33:38.349 --> 04:33:38.359 align:start position:0%
last minute memos from the Secretary of
 
04:33:41.269 --> 04:33:41.279 align:start position:0%
State or the attorney general and these
 
04:33:45.429 --> 04:33:45.439 align:start position:0%
memos are not laws but process
 
04:33:48.949 --> 04:33:48.959 align:start position:0%
suggestions many towns exclusively hand
 
04:33:51.629 --> 04:33:51.639 align:start position:0%
Count Their ballots such as Southampton
 
04:33:55.189 --> 04:33:55.199 align:start position:0%
or as we all know dicksville Notch and
 
04:33:57.830 --> 04:33:57.840 align:start position:0%
of course our original New Hampshire
 
04:34:00.429 --> 04:34:00.439 align:start position:0%
Constitution provided for the hand
 
04:34:04.230 --> 04:34:04.240 align:start position:0%
counting of ballots so this is just
 
04:34:07.230 --> 04:34:07.240 align:start position:0%
simply making it very consistent that
 
04:34:09.551 --> 04:34:09.561 align:start position:0%
cities or towns are allowed to have
 
04:34:11.789 --> 04:34:11.799 align:start position:0%
their voters as defined in the con
 
04:34:14.269 --> 04:34:14.279 align:start position:0%
Constitution hand Count Their
 
04:34:17.830 --> 04:34:17.840 align:start position:0%
ballots the other objective of this bill
 
04:34:21.670 --> 04:34:21.680 align:start position:0%
has two parts the first is enabling
 
04:34:24.551 --> 04:34:24.561 align:start position:0%
legislation to allow Selectmen or the
 
04:34:27.789 --> 04:34:27.799 align:start position:0%
town clerk at their discretion to
 
04:34:31.310 --> 04:34:31.320 align:start position:0%
conduct a supplemental hand count of a
 
04:34:34.709 --> 04:34:34.719 align:start position:0%
specific race to confirm the
 
04:34:38.510 --> 04:34:38.520 align:start position:0%
results a supplemental count is simply a
 
04:34:41.789 --> 04:34:41.799 align:start position:0%
second count before certification
 
04:34:45.910 --> 04:34:45.920 align:start position:0%
it is not an audit or recount these two
 
04:34:50.269 --> 04:34:50.279 align:start position:0%
processes have very specific rules and
 
04:34:53.590 --> 04:34:53.600 align:start position:0%
these uh Audits and recounts U happen
 
04:34:58.310 --> 04:34:58.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:01.910 --> 04:35:01.920 align:start position:0%
announced this enabling legislation will
 
04:35:04.949 --> 04:35:04.959 align:start position:0%
allow Selectmen or town clerks to
 
04:35:08.269 --> 04:35:08.279 align:start position:0%
conduct this supplemental hand count of
 
04:35:11.750 --> 04:35:11.760 align:start position:0%
ballots at their discretion or for
 
04:35:13.949 --> 04:35:13.959 align:start position:0%
ballots not processed through a voting
 
04:35:16.590 --> 04:35:16.600 align:start position:0%
machine or counted from a machine that
 
04:35:20.349 --> 04:35:20.359 align:start position:0%
may have failed during the voting period
 
04:35:23.429 --> 04:35:23.439 align:start position:0%
in the recent past Selectmen and town
 
04:35:26.390 --> 04:35:26.400 align:start position:0%
clerks were discouraged or
 
04:35:29.551 --> 04:35:29.561 align:start position:0%
preventing from performing this uh
 
04:35:32.349 --> 04:35:32.359 align:start position:0%
discretionary supplemental hand count of
 
04:35:35.750 --> 04:35:35.760 align:start position:0%
a specific election race to cross check
 
04:35:38.470 --> 04:35:38.480 align:start position:0%
and validate machine counts and this
 
04:35:41.750 --> 04:35:41.760 align:start position:0%
happened days before an election through
 
04:35:44.310 --> 04:35:44.320 align:start position:0%
the use of these arbitrary memos from
 
04:35:46.869 --> 04:35:46.879 align:start position:0%
the Secretary of State or attorney
 
04:35:49.949 --> 04:35:49.959 align:start position:0%
general so the purpose of this bill is
 
04:35:54.269 --> 04:35:54.279 align:start position:0%
to codify the practice for Selectmen or
 
04:35:57.029 --> 04:35:57.039 align:start position:0%
town or city officials the ab the
 
04:36:00.150 --> 04:36:00.160 align:start position:0%
ability to conduct at their discretion
 
04:36:02.949 --> 04:36:02.959 align:start position:0%
this supplemental hand count for a
 
04:36:05.789 --> 04:36:05.799 align:start position:0%
specific race just to confirm the
 
04:36:08.189 --> 04:36:08.199 align:start position:0%
election results without these
 
04:36:10.990 --> 04:36:11.000 align:start position:0%
lastminute advisory rules from the
 
04:36:14.029 --> 04:36:14.039 align:start position:0%
executive or the judicial
 
04:36:17.750 --> 04:36:17.760 align:start position:0%
branch our New Hampshire constitution in
 
04:36:21.869 --> 04:36:21.879 align:start position:0%
part two Article 2 and you could see my
 
04:36:26.551 --> 04:36:26.561 align:start position:0%
well-worn copy is very specific about
 
04:36:29.510 --> 04:36:29.520 align:start position:0%
allowing Selectmen to witness the count
 
04:36:32.670 --> 04:36:32.680 align:start position:0%
of votes with the Town Clerk and the
 
04:36:35.109 --> 04:36:35.119 align:start position:0%
moderator is responsible for counting
 
04:36:36.750 --> 04:36:36.760 align:start position:0%
the votes in
 
04:36:40.310 --> 04:36:40.320 align:start position:0%
elections in summary article 32 states
 
04:36:42.029 --> 04:36:42.039 align:start position:0%
that the Selectmen
 
04:36:45.189 --> 04:36:45.199 align:start position:0%
whose Duty it shall be to attend an open
 
04:36:47.949 --> 04:36:47.959 align:start position:0%
meeting receive the votes of all the
 
04:36:50.670 --> 04:36:50.680 align:start position:0%
inhabitants of such towns and Wards
 
04:36:54.070 --> 04:36:54.080 align:start position:0%
present and shall in said meetings in
 
04:36:57.029 --> 04:36:57.039 align:start position:0%
the presence of the said Selectmen and
 
04:36:59.590 --> 04:36:59.600 align:start position:0%
of the town or city clerk in said
 
04:37:03.189 --> 04:37:03.199 align:start position:0%
meetings sort and count the said votes
 
04:37:06.551 --> 04:37:06.561 align:start position:0%
and make a public declaration thereof
 
04:37:08.390 --> 04:37:08.400 align:start position:0%
you got to love the writers of this
 
04:37:11.109 --> 04:37:11.119 align:start position:0%
thing because they really thought
 
04:37:14.510 --> 04:37:14.520 align:start position:0%
through it it um and then of course they
 
04:37:17.269 --> 04:37:17.279 align:start position:0%
have a a responsibility to name every
 
04:37:20.189 --> 04:37:20.199 align:start position:0%
person voted voting and count the number
 
04:37:23.349 --> 04:37:23.359 align:start position:0%
of votes for each person so simply
 
04:37:26.590 --> 04:37:26.600 align:start position:0%
stated this bill will provide a
 
04:37:30.269 --> 04:37:30.279 align:start position:0%
consistent framework for use throughout
 
04:37:32.629 --> 04:37:32.639 align:start position:0%
the state for hand counting and
 
04:37:35.470 --> 04:37:35.480 align:start position:0%
supplemental counting of votes as
 
04:37:37.269 --> 04:37:37.279 align:start position:0%
defined in our New Hampshire
 
04:37:40.910 --> 04:37:40.920 align:start position:0%
constitution in part two article 32
 
04:37:44.629 --> 04:37:44.639 align:start position:0%
without confusing last minute directives
 
04:37:47.029 --> 04:37:47.039 align:start position:0%
from the Secretary of State or attorney
 
04:37:49.349 --> 04:37:49.359 align:start position:0%
general thank
 
04:37:51.670 --> 04:37:51.680 align:start position:0%
you okay we'll be taking questions from
 
04:37:53.709 --> 04:37:53.719 align:start position:0%
the committee are there questions from
 
04:37:53.719 --> 04:37:54.429 align:start position:0%
the committee are there questions from
the

04:37:54.429 --> 04:37:54.439 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:37:56.789 --> 04:37:56.799 align:start position:0%
committee um we'll start we'll go right
 
04:37:59.670 --> 04:37:59.680 align:start position:0%
to left to representative C thank you Mr
 
04:38:01.029 --> 04:38:01.039 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you representative for
 
04:38:03.310 --> 04:38:03.320 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
04:38:07.029 --> 04:38:07.039 align:start position:0%
um I was very concerned about
 
04:38:09.470 --> 04:38:09.480 align:start position:0%
online can you talk in on the mic just a
 
04:38:11.230 --> 04:38:11.240 align:start position:0%
little more I'm having trouble hearing
 
04:38:11.240 --> 04:38:12.070 align:start position:0%
little more I'm having trouble hearing
you

04:38:12.070 --> 04:38:12.080 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:38:13.029 --> 04:38:13.039 align:start position:0%
I'm having trouble hearing you know
 
04:38:18.629 --> 04:38:18.639 align:start position:0%
people at home are um on the line uh uh
 
04:38:20.390 --> 04:38:20.400 align:start position:0%
well on on the last paragraph beginning
 
04:38:20.400 --> 04:38:21.390 align:start position:0%
well on on the last paragraph beginning
on

04:38:21.390 --> 04:38:21.400 align:start position:0%
on
 
04:38:26.750 --> 04:38:26.760 align:start position:0%
19 um it gives the U uh Clerk or
 
04:38:29.070 --> 04:38:29.080 align:start position:0%
selectman their discretion and then it
 
04:38:30.830 --> 04:38:30.840 align:start position:0%
lists three different things one of
 
04:38:33.709 --> 04:38:33.719 align:start position:0%
those the second one is the hand count
 
04:38:36.150 --> 04:38:36.160 align:start position:0%
ballots that were not processed through
 
04:38:37.551 --> 04:38:37.561 align:start position:0%
a voting
 
04:38:41.629 --> 04:38:41.639 align:start position:0%
machine um and my concern is because you
 
04:38:44.750 --> 04:38:44.760 align:start position:0%
a votes and also overvotes don't go
 
04:38:46.709 --> 04:38:46.719 align:start position:0%
through there but we need to count all
 
04:38:49.390 --> 04:38:49.400 align:start position:0%
ballots should that not have been in
 
04:38:52.709 --> 04:38:52.719 align:start position:0%
there well this is for the supplemental
 
04:38:55.470 --> 04:38:55.480 align:start position:0%
count so the selectman could say for a
 
04:38:59.230 --> 04:38:59.240 align:start position:0%
specific race let's count all of the
 
04:39:02.230 --> 04:39:02.240 align:start position:0%
ballots hand count all of the ballots so
 
04:39:05.150 --> 04:39:05.160 align:start position:0%
we can compare the hand count of a
 
04:39:08.269 --> 04:39:08.279 align:start position:0%
specific race versus whatever the
 
04:39:11.390 --> 04:39:11.400 align:start position:0%
machine and the other uh processes said
 
04:39:14.789 --> 04:39:14.799 align:start position:0%
so it's just a double check before the
 
04:39:16.830 --> 04:39:16.840 align:start position:0%
vote is certified that's all that a
 
04:39:20.029 --> 04:39:20.039 align:start position:0%
supplemental count is and some towns do
 
04:39:22.629 --> 04:39:22.639 align:start position:0%
this but unfortunately in the last
 
04:39:25.629 --> 04:39:25.639 align:start position:0%
election there was some very confusing
 
04:39:29.310 --> 04:39:29.320 align:start position:0%
Direction about not allowing certain uh
 
04:39:32.590 --> 04:39:32.600 align:start position:0%
moderators to use this process so it's
 
04:39:35.590 --> 04:39:35.600 align:start position:0%
just a process of a checkin
 
04:39:37.910 --> 04:39:37.920 align:start position:0%
balance okay I I found it a little
 
04:39:39.990 --> 04:39:40.000 align:start position:0%
confusing reading but anyway got got do
 
04:39:41.628 --> 04:39:41.638 align:start position:0%
a followup if you're going to do if you
 
04:39:44.190 --> 04:39:44.200 align:start position:0%
believe I found it confusing um
 
04:39:44.200 --> 04:39:48.830 align:start position:0%
believe I found it confusing um
representative

04:39:48.830 --> 04:39:48.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:52.310 --> 04:39:52.320 align:start position:0%
Lane I are you do you know the reason
 
04:39:54.750 --> 04:39:54.760 align:start position:0%
why this Memo from the Secretary of
 
04:39:57.670 --> 04:39:57.680 align:start position:0%
State came out I mean I I I'm not aware
 
04:39:59.550 --> 04:39:59.560 align:start position:0%
of it so I I really don't know much
 
04:40:02.310 --> 04:40:02.320 align:start position:0%
about that memo so I represent Hampton
 
04:40:04.868 --> 04:40:04.878 align:start position:0%
Falls in Kensington and yes in
 
04:40:08.948 --> 04:40:08.958 align:start position:0%
Kensington the uh moderator did rece and
 
04:40:11.788 --> 04:40:11.798 align:start position:0%
moderators received this um memo and I
 
04:40:14.030 --> 04:40:14.040 align:start position:0%
did see it in the town of Kensington
 
04:40:16.230 --> 04:40:16.240 align:start position:0%
that I represent and it was very
 
04:40:18.910 --> 04:40:18.920 align:start position:0%
confusing because it again it's not law
 
04:40:22.190 --> 04:40:22.200 align:start position:0%
it was just a directive about hand
 
04:40:24.190 --> 04:40:24.200 align:start position:0%
counts and preventing supplemental
 
04:40:27.310 --> 04:40:27.320 align:start position:0%
counts and it got to be very confusing
 
04:40:31.230 --> 04:40:31.240 align:start position:0%
for um many moderators because it's not
 
04:40:34.270 --> 04:40:34.280 align:start position:0%
a consistent practice throughout the
 
04:40:36.868 --> 04:40:36.878 align:start position:0%
state further questions from the
 
04:40:39.990 --> 04:40:40.000 align:start position:0%
committee represent Nome thank you and
 
04:40:42.270 --> 04:40:42.280 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking the question um as
 
04:40:44.030 --> 04:40:44.040 align:start position:0%
you noted in your testimony we heard a
 
04:40:47.390 --> 04:40:47.400 align:start position:0%
bill earlier to allow for the voter to
 
04:40:50.230 --> 04:40:50.240 align:start position:0%
request hand counting and I notice that
 
04:40:53.708 --> 04:40:53.718 align:start position:0%
your bill amends a different section of
 
04:40:56.670 --> 04:40:56.680 align:start position:0%
the rsas do we need to amend it in both
 
04:40:58.708 --> 04:40:58.718 align:start position:0%
sections or would only one spot be
 
04:41:01.990 --> 04:41:02.000 align:start position:0%
sufficient I will double check with OS I
 
04:41:04.788 --> 04:41:04.798 align:start position:0%
noted I asked them about this before
 
04:41:07.708 --> 04:41:07.718 align:start position:0%
they um actually drafted the bill and
 
04:41:11.788 --> 04:41:11.798 align:start position:0%
they I was advised this is the section
 
04:41:14.590 --> 04:41:14.600 align:start position:0%
but obviously they're two bills asking
 
04:41:17.030 --> 04:41:17.040 align:start position:0%
for the same thing so we'll have to
 
04:41:20.590 --> 04:41:20.600 align:start position:0%
figure out how to um how how to make
 
04:41:23.510 --> 04:41:23.520 align:start position:0%
sure that it makes sense and may have a
 
04:41:27.470 --> 04:41:27.480 align:start position:0%
followup yes um thank you and through
 
04:41:30.230 --> 04:41:30.240 align:start position:0%
this process um I believe you said it
 
04:41:33.510 --> 04:41:33.520 align:start position:0%
was the moderator whose responsibility
 
04:41:37.390 --> 04:41:37.400 align:start position:0%
it is to announce the total
 
04:41:40.270 --> 04:41:40.280 align:start position:0%
votes what happens then if any of these
 
04:41:41.750 --> 04:41:41.760 align:start position:0%
supplemental things come comes up with a
 
04:41:46.390 --> 04:41:46.400 align:start position:0%
different result who's who say it's the
 
04:41:48.948 --> 04:41:48.958 align:start position:0%
the according to what I understand it's
 
04:41:51.910 --> 04:41:51.920 align:start position:0%
the moderator that will have to um
 
04:41:55.788 --> 04:41:55.798 align:start position:0%
review the counts from from for the for
 
04:41:58.628 --> 04:41:58.638 align:start position:0%
the specific race and make sure that
 
04:42:00.590 --> 04:42:00.600 align:start position:0%
everything comes out even they've got to
 
04:42:02.788 --> 04:42:02.798 align:start position:0%
balance it
 
04:42:05.708 --> 04:42:05.718 align:start position:0%

04:42:08.390 --> 04:42:08.400 align:start position:0%
representative we thank you Mr chair and
 
04:42:10.550 --> 04:42:10.560 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question so this
 
04:42:13.830 --> 04:42:13.840 align:start position:0%
is uh um this is not a recount it's not
 
04:42:16.110 --> 04:42:16.120 align:start position:0%
an audit it is simply kind of a quality
 
04:42:17.868 --> 04:42:17.878 align:start position:0%
control check on the quantity of ballots
 
04:42:20.628 --> 04:42:20.638 align:start position:0%
that have been accumulated during that
 
04:42:23.948 --> 04:42:23.958 align:start position:0%
election process um has this practice
 
04:42:27.830 --> 04:42:27.840 align:start position:0%
been in place before yes many towns
 
04:42:31.150 --> 04:42:31.160 align:start position:0%
currently employ this and uh we just
 
04:42:35.390 --> 04:42:35.400 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that it it is um a
 
04:42:37.990 --> 04:42:38.000 align:start position:0%
consistent process throughout the state
 
04:42:40.510 --> 04:42:40.520 align:start position:0%
so that there's no confusion on Election
 
04:42:40.520 --> 04:42:42.628 align:start position:0%
so that there's no confusion on Election
Day

04:42:42.628 --> 04:42:42.638 align:start position:0%
Day
 
04:42:44.030 --> 04:42:44.040 align:start position:0%
further questions from the
 
04:42:46.628 --> 04:42:46.638 align:start position:0%
committee representative
 
04:42:49.430 --> 04:42:49.440 align:start position:0%
Gilmore you know I've been a moderator
 
04:42:51.190 --> 04:42:51.200 align:start position:0%
for over 12 years and I've never heard
 
04:42:54.110 --> 04:42:54.120 align:start position:0%
of this but my real question is when
 
04:42:57.070 --> 04:42:57.080 align:start position:0%
you're doing a supplemental hand count
 
04:42:59.830 --> 04:42:59.840 align:start position:0%
are you counting every ballot for that
 
04:43:03.230 --> 04:43:03.240 align:start position:0%
race for a particular race correct just
 
04:43:07.190 --> 04:43:07.200 align:start position:0%
to make sure that they um match what the
 
04:43:09.948 --> 04:43:09.958 align:start position:0%
tape results would be you know in these
 
04:43:11.670 --> 04:43:11.680 align:start position:0%
presidential elections I'm going home at
 
04:43:13.910 --> 04:43:13.920 align:start position:0%
2 a.m. I can't imag follow the
 
04:43:15.990 --> 04:43:16.000 align:start position:0%
representative Gilmore no question thank
 
04:43:16.000 --> 04:43:17.110 align:start position:0%
representative Gilmore no question thank
you

04:43:17.110 --> 04:43:17.120 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:43:20.750 --> 04:43:20.760 align:start position:0%
okay it's not it's not every race it is
 
04:43:23.788 --> 04:43:23.798 align:start position:0%
at the discretion of you know the town
 
04:43:25.470 --> 04:43:25.480 align:start position:0%
clerk or
 
04:43:30.390 --> 04:43:30.400 align:start position:0%
um Selectmen for a specific
 
04:43:32.550 --> 04:43:32.560 align:start position:0%
race all right further questions from
 
04:43:34.830 --> 04:43:34.840 align:start position:0%
the committee um thank you so much just
 
04:43:36.830 --> 04:43:36.840 align:start position:0%
so everybody knows I did just send in an
 
04:43:38.190 --> 04:43:38.200 align:start position:0%
email to the Secretary of State and I
 
04:43:39.430 --> 04:43:39.440 align:start position:0%
copied the ranking member of the vice
 
04:43:42.190 --> 04:43:42.200 align:start position:0%
chairman for to get a copy of memo uh so
 
04:43:43.430 --> 04:43:43.440 align:start position:0%
if we get a copy of the memo I'll
 
04:43:45.750 --> 04:43:45.760 align:start position:0%
distribute it to the um Committee in a
 
04:43:48.470 --> 04:43:48.480 align:start position:0%
in a BCC email to avoid a conversation
 
04:43:50.350 --> 04:43:50.360 align:start position:0%
um but I think it's I think there's
 
04:43:51.990 --> 04:43:52.000 align:start position:0%
enough questions around this memo that
 
04:43:54.590 --> 04:43:54.600 align:start position:0%
we should probably lay eyes on it um La
 
04:43:57.150 --> 04:43:57.160 align:start position:0%
I only have one pink card um so it's a
 
04:43:57.160 --> 04:44:00.628 align:start position:0%

04:44:31.948 --> 04:44:31.958 align:start position:0%

reference that's fine we have plenty of
 
04:44:39.030 --> 04:44:39.040 align:start position:0%
time so it's fine we're towards the end
 
04:44:40.030 --> 04:44:40.040 align:start position:0%
of the
 
04:45:40.190 --> 04:45:40.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:40.200 --> 04:45:44.070 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:45:44.070 --> 04:45:44.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:49.430 --> 04:45:49.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:49.440 --> 04:45:57.310 align:start position:0%
 
entry

04:45:57.310 --> 04:45:57.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:00.868 --> 04:46:00.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:03.390 --> 04:46:03.400 align:start position:0%
ready thank you very much uh Al brand
 
04:46:06.110 --> 04:46:06.120 align:start position:0%
Dano Kensington New Hampshire um I'm I'm
 
04:46:09.350 --> 04:46:09.360 align:start position:0%
here in support of this bill um first of
 
04:46:12.670 --> 04:46:12.680 align:start position:0%
all I want to make perfectly clear um if
 
04:46:15.270 --> 04:46:15.280 align:start position:0%
you look at uh unfortunately for the
 
04:46:18.590 --> 04:46:18.600 align:start position:0%
reference I didn't have the 2025 manual
 
04:46:22.510 --> 04:46:22.520 align:start position:0%
so it is the same on page four I want to
 
04:46:25.190 --> 04:46:25.200 align:start position:0%
point out to you Roman numeral 4 it's
 
04:46:28.788 --> 04:46:28.798 align:start position:0%
the same in the 2025 26 manual the
 
04:46:30.350 --> 04:46:30.360 align:start position:0%
bottom part I'm not going to read it to
 
04:46:33.628 --> 04:46:33.638 align:start position:0%
you but what it basically says if
 
04:46:36.230 --> 04:46:36.240 align:start position:0%
there's ever a conflict in the manual in
 
04:46:38.750 --> 04:46:38.760 align:start position:0%
the policy and procedure manual this
 
04:46:40.470 --> 04:46:40.480 align:start position:0%
between the Secretary of State and a
 
04:46:43.350 --> 04:46:43.360 align:start position:0%
moderate Ator or the town the town
 
04:46:46.350 --> 04:46:46.360 align:start position:0%
attorney is the person who makes the
 
04:46:48.708 --> 04:46:48.718 align:start position:0%
decision the point I'm I'm making here
 
04:46:51.030 --> 04:46:51.040 align:start position:0%
is the moderator in the town is
 
04:46:52.948 --> 04:46:52.958 align:start position:0%
responsible for all
 
04:46:56.510 --> 04:46:56.520 align:start position:0%
elections this document clearly states
 
04:46:59.150 --> 04:46:59.160 align:start position:0%
that who who is responsible so the
 
04:47:02.190 --> 04:47:02.200 align:start position:0%
moderator is the responsible party the
 
04:47:04.990 --> 04:47:05.000 align:start position:0%
second part I gave you is um the
 
04:47:07.310 --> 04:47:07.320 align:start position:0%
Constitution if you look at it's part
 
04:47:10.430 --> 04:47:10.440 align:start position:0%
two article 32 it's really specific once
 
04:47:13.948 --> 04:47:13.958 align:start position:0%
again 1784 there was no electricity so
 
04:47:17.510 --> 04:47:17.520 align:start position:0%
Hand counting was you know that was it
 
04:47:19.868 --> 04:47:19.878 align:start position:0%
and uh and on this case if you look at
 
04:47:22.110 --> 04:47:22.120 align:start position:0%
it the moderator will sort and count the
 
04:47:25.230 --> 04:47:25.240 align:start position:0%
votes very important that's what he does
 
04:47:29.030 --> 04:47:29.040 align:start position:0%
the Selectmen in the town clerks act as
 
04:47:32.628 --> 04:47:32.638 align:start position:0%
the um eyes the witnesses they're the
 
04:47:34.788 --> 04:47:34.798 align:start position:0%
ones who sign off at the end of the
 
04:47:37.628 --> 04:47:37.638 align:start position:0%
night that the election was conducted
 
04:47:39.708 --> 04:47:39.718 align:start position:0%
correctly just like now when they sign
 
04:47:41.948 --> 04:47:41.958 align:start position:0%
off uh at at the end of the night the
 
04:47:43.948 --> 04:47:43.958 align:start position:0%
select M Town Clerk as well as the
 
04:47:46.430 --> 04:47:46.440 align:start position:0%
moderator what happened was when we
 
04:47:49.150 --> 04:47:49.160 align:start position:0%
allowed the election to be done by a
 
04:47:51.510 --> 04:47:51.520 align:start position:0%
machine constitutionally we didn't
 
04:47:54.350 --> 04:47:54.360 align:start position:0%
follow up with the responsibility of the
 
04:47:56.230 --> 04:47:56.240 align:start position:0%
Selectmen and the town clerks they're
 
04:47:59.430 --> 04:47:59.440 align:start position:0%
always the responsible party to verify
 
04:48:02.230 --> 04:48:02.240 align:start position:0%
the election before it happen so that's
 
04:48:04.390 --> 04:48:04.400 align:start position:0%
why I'm suppored this bill it allows
 
04:48:06.310 --> 04:48:06.320 align:start position:0%
them if there's something wrong in the
 
04:48:08.868 --> 04:48:08.878 align:start position:0%
election process allows the selectman
 
04:48:10.270 --> 04:48:10.280 align:start position:0%
and the town clerk to say to the
 
04:48:12.510 --> 04:48:12.520 align:start position:0%
moderator hey wait a minute let's do a
 
04:48:14.788 --> 04:48:14.798 align:start position:0%
secondary count which has been it's
 
04:48:17.910 --> 04:48:17.920 align:start position:0%
happened in the state from 2014 on I
 
04:48:19.230 --> 04:48:19.240 align:start position:0%
have it here I'll leave it up on the
 
04:48:22.230 --> 04:48:22.240 align:start position:0%
message and it's from uh I'll say it uh
 
04:48:24.430 --> 04:48:24.440 align:start position:0%
it was uh the moderators may use this
 
04:48:26.230 --> 04:48:26.240 align:start position:0%
discretion as to whether or not they
 
04:48:28.150 --> 04:48:28.160 align:start position:0%
will conduct such a count on Election
 
04:48:30.868 --> 04:48:30.878 align:start position:0%
night if they decide to conduct a second
 
04:48:32.788 --> 04:48:32.798 align:start position:0%
count on Election night they should have
 
04:48:35.470 --> 04:48:35.480 align:start position:0%
a good reason for doing so moderators do
 
04:48:38.830 --> 04:48:38.840 align:start position:0%
not need the cond do not need to conduct
 
04:48:41.070 --> 04:48:41.080 align:start position:0%
such a second count just because some
 
04:48:43.750 --> 04:48:43.760 align:start position:0%
member of the public requested one it's
 
04:48:46.510 --> 04:48:46.520 align:start position:0%
really important so we all understand we
 
04:48:49.190 --> 04:48:49.200 align:start position:0%
want to give that Authority Constitution
 
04:48:51.190 --> 04:48:51.200 align:start position:0%
Authority back to them they're not aware
 
04:48:53.390 --> 04:48:53.400 align:start position:0%
of it most Mo most Selectmen and town
 
04:48:55.470 --> 04:48:55.480 align:start position:0%
clerks are not aware of it we're just
 
04:48:57.708 --> 04:48:57.718 align:start position:0%
caught bringing this back into the
 
04:49:01.868 --> 04:49:01.878 align:start position:0%
Constitution um and finally uh hb1 154
 
04:49:04.910 --> 04:49:04.920 align:start position:0%
is really important um and and um
 
04:49:07.190 --> 04:49:07.200 align:start position:0%
chairman of this committee had quite a
 
04:49:09.990 --> 04:49:10.000 align:start position:0%
hand in structuring it it was a non-gain
 
04:49:11.350 --> 04:49:11.360 align:start position:0%
healthc care bill
 
04:49:13.430 --> 04:49:13.440 align:start position:0%
that ended up being coming election law
 
04:49:17.310 --> 04:49:17.320 align:start position:0%
22 election Law changes were put into a
 
04:49:21.990 --> 04:49:22.000 align:start position:0%
non- Germain um election um sorry a uh
 
04:49:24.110 --> 04:49:24.120 align:start position:0%
healthc care bill but I point out to you
 
04:49:27.350 --> 04:49:27.360 align:start position:0%
on page five if you look at page 5 even
 
04:49:29.628 --> 04:49:29.638 align:start position:0%
in hb1 154 it
 
04:49:32.708 --> 04:49:32.718 align:start position:0%
recognizes it's to follow the directions
 
04:49:35.070 --> 04:49:35.080 align:start position:0%
of the moderator you can put it in the
 
04:49:39.190 --> 04:49:39.200 align:start position:0%
machine or follow the directions of the
 
04:49:41.230 --> 04:49:41.240 align:start position:0%

04:49:48.868 --> 04:49:48.878 align:start position:0%
back to the Constitution and I'm support
 
04:49:52.110 --> 04:49:52.120 align:start position:0%

senior systems analyst for a software
 
04:50:36.590 --> 04:50:36.600 align:start position:0%

conversation because one thing you
 
04:50:39.990 --> 04:50:40.000 align:start position:0%
should all understand if you don't
 
04:50:41.310 --> 04:50:41.320 align:start position:0%
understand is that if a machine can be
 
04:50:43.470 --> 04:50:43.480 align:start position:0%
programmed to do good a machine can be
 
04:50:46.070 --> 04:50:46.080 align:start position:0%
programmed to do bad a machine can also
 
04:50:48.590 --> 04:50:48.600 align:start position:0%
malfunction and a machine can have bugs
 
04:50:51.990 --> 04:50:52.000 align:start position:0%
so the tabulators and N are they um lauo
 
04:50:53.990 --> 04:50:54.000 align:start position:0%
tabulators but they're programmed so
 
04:50:56.190 --> 04:50:56.200 align:start position:0%
they're dependent upon who's doing the
 
04:50:58.670 --> 04:50:58.680 align:start position:0%
programming so the reason parallel hand
 
04:51:00.830 --> 04:51:00.840 align:start position:0%
counts are or supplemental hand counts
 
04:51:02.510 --> 04:51:02.520 align:start position:0%
were important and they were started
 
04:51:04.910 --> 04:51:04.920 align:start position:0%
historically by w w moderator Wally Fri
 
04:51:08.030 --> 04:51:08.040 align:start position:0%
of Danville is that allows a moderator
 
04:51:09.430 --> 04:51:09.440 align:start position:0%
to know that the machines are actually
 
04:51:11.110 --> 04:51:11.120 align:start position:0%
working correctly because the moderators
 
04:51:12.470 --> 04:51:12.480 align:start position:0%
are not involved in the testing of the
 
04:51:13.990 --> 04:51:14.000 align:start position:0%
machines the testing of the machines
 
04:51:15.470 --> 04:51:15.480 align:start position:0%
happens prior to the moderators
 
04:51:18.430 --> 04:51:18.440 align:start position:0%
receiving them on Election Day and all
 
04:51:20.110 --> 04:51:20.120 align:start position:0%
we see is that there's evidence that the
 
04:51:21.948 --> 04:51:21.958 align:start position:0%
machine was tested the city clerk signed
 
04:51:23.510 --> 04:51:23.520 align:start position:0%
off that it's working properly but we
 
04:51:25.868 --> 04:51:25.878 align:start position:0%
have no idea that it is working properly
 
04:51:27.708 --> 04:51:27.718 align:start position:0%
so Wally fly Fri came up with a
 
04:51:29.390 --> 04:51:29.400 align:start position:0%
supplemental or parallel hand count so
 
04:51:30.670 --> 04:51:30.680 align:start position:0%
that he could hand count the races and
 
04:51:32.350 --> 04:51:32.360 align:start position:0%
compare those results to what the
 
04:51:33.788 --> 04:51:33.798 align:start position:0%
machines were actually
 
04:51:36.510 --> 04:51:36.520 align:start position:0%
saying so that's why the supplemental
 
04:51:38.110 --> 04:51:38.120 align:start position:0%
parallel handc counts are important
 
04:51:39.868 --> 04:51:39.878 align:start position:0%
because as I said as moderator people
 
04:51:41.628 --> 04:51:41.638 align:start position:0%
are increasing not trusting of our
 
04:51:43.510 --> 04:51:43.520 align:start position:0%
voting systems and that they know the
 
04:51:46.548 --> 04:51:46.558 align:start position:0%
machines can be messed with look up
 
04:51:48.750 --> 04:51:48.760 align:start position:0%
Harry hsty in the in the tabulator as
 
04:51:50.750 --> 04:51:50.760 align:start position:0%
anyone can see that on YouTube the
 
04:51:52.390 --> 04:51:52.400 align:start position:0%
second part of this is the Secretary of
 
04:51:53.910 --> 04:51:53.920 align:start position:0%
State and the Attorney General since
 
04:51:56.070 --> 04:51:56.080 align:start position:0%
2016 have been usurping the authority of
 
04:51:58.190 --> 04:51:58.200 align:start position:0%
the moderators and threatening and
 
04:51:59.670 --> 04:51:59.680 align:start position:0%
intimidating moderators not to perform
 
04:52:01.708 --> 04:52:01.718 align:start position:0%
their constitutional duties this
 
04:52:03.990 --> 04:52:04.000 align:start position:0%
happened to me in November 5th 2024 I
 
04:52:05.390 --> 04:52:05.400 align:start position:0%
was going to perform a parallel
 
04:52:07.030 --> 04:52:07.040 align:start position:0%
supplemental hand count of the
 
04:52:09.990 --> 04:52:10.000 align:start position:0%
governor's race I had my um moderator
 
04:52:11.788 --> 04:52:11.798 align:start position:0%
Pro and one of the slackman all set to
 
04:52:13.470 --> 04:52:13.480 align:start position:0%
do that we had four teams of two to
 
04:52:16.310 --> 04:52:16.320 align:start position:0%
count all the votes and uh my ward clerk
 
04:52:17.670 --> 04:52:17.680 align:start position:0%
called the attorney general on me and
 
04:52:19.110 --> 04:52:19.120 align:start position:0%
reported me that I was doing something
 
04:52:21.390 --> 04:52:21.400 align:start position:0%
that was illegal I got on a phone with
 
04:52:22.830 --> 04:52:22.840 align:start position:0%
Dick Tracy from the Attorney General's
 
04:52:24.270 --> 04:52:24.280 align:start position:0%
office who threatened with having me
 
04:52:26.590 --> 04:52:26.600 align:start position:0%
arrested and for committing a crime
 
04:52:28.030 --> 04:52:28.040 align:start position:0%
violating election law that I did not
 
04:52:30.070 --> 04:52:30.080 align:start position:0%
have the authority to count the votes as
 
04:52:33.070 --> 04:52:33.080 align:start position:0%
I saw I saw fit so for personal reasons
 
04:52:34.590 --> 04:52:34.600 align:start position:0%
and at the end of a 20-hour day I
 
04:52:36.310 --> 04:52:36.320 align:start position:0%
decided to tell my team count them as
 
04:52:39.670 --> 04:52:39.680 align:start position:0%
they normally would and Mr Tracy told me
 
04:52:41.590 --> 04:52:41.600 align:start position:0%
that if we put the ballots in one pile
 
04:52:43.590 --> 04:52:43.600 align:start position:0%
it's legal if we put the ballots in two
 
04:52:45.230 --> 04:52:45.240 align:start position:0%
or more piles it's illegal because
 
04:52:47.590 --> 04:52:47.600 align:start position:0%
that's an audit now I'd also like to
 
04:52:49.590 --> 04:52:49.600 align:start position:0%
refer you all to the opinion of the
 
04:52:52.990 --> 04:52:53.000 align:start position:0%
justices 53n 640 and and and it was
 
04:52:55.430 --> 04:52:55.440 align:start position:0%
decided in 1873 by the new Hamp Supreme
 
04:52:57.788 --> 04:52:57.798 align:start position:0%
Court of New Hampshire which recognizes
 
04:52:59.390 --> 04:52:59.400 align:start position:0%
the Constitution gives the moderated
 
04:53:01.390 --> 04:53:01.400 align:start position:0%
authority to govern the election the
 
04:53:02.788 --> 04:53:02.798 align:start position:0%
secretary of state does not have the
 
04:53:04.150 --> 04:53:04.160 align:start position:0%
authority to govern the election the
 
04:53:05.510 --> 04:53:05.520 align:start position:0%
city clerks doesn't have the authority
 
04:53:07.230 --> 04:53:07.240 align:start position:0%
to go the election the Attorney General
 
04:53:08.788 --> 04:53:08.798 align:start position:0%
does not have the authority the
 
04:53:10.708 --> 04:53:10.718 align:start position:0%
moderator has that Authority the
 
04:53:13.350 --> 04:53:13.360 align:start position:0%
moderator the justic has also said in
 
04:53:15.390 --> 04:53:15.400 align:start position:0%
any case to which these constitutional
 
04:53:17.270 --> 04:53:17.280 align:start position:0%
Provisions are applicable they are the
 
04:53:19.750 --> 04:53:19.760 align:start position:0%
controlling and supreme law of the state
 
04:53:21.350 --> 04:53:21.360 align:start position:0%
and by the statute first cited they're
 
04:53:23.548 --> 04:53:23.558 align:start position:0%
made applicable to representes in Con in
 
04:53:25.628 --> 04:53:25.638 align:start position:0%
Congress the Constitution and these
 
04:53:27.470 --> 04:53:27.480 align:start position:0%
statutes are too explicit to leave any
 
04:53:29.270 --> 04:53:29.280 align:start position:0%
doubt in the minds of the general public
 
04:53:31.070 --> 04:53:31.080 align:start position:0%
of the duty of the moderator to count
 
04:53:33.270 --> 04:53:33.280 align:start position:0%
the votes make a public declaration
 
04:53:35.628 --> 04:53:35.638 align:start position:0%
thereof it furthermore says that if
 
04:53:37.590 --> 04:53:37.600 align:start position:0%
there's a problem on Election night the
 
04:53:39.270 --> 04:53:39.280 align:start position:0%
best way to correct that problem is with
 
04:53:41.390 --> 04:53:41.400 align:start position:0%
the moderator on election tonight not
 
04:53:42.548 --> 04:53:42.558 align:start position:0%
waiting until the secretary of state
 
04:53:43.390 --> 04:53:43.400 align:start position:0%
does a
 
04:53:46.310 --> 04:53:46.320 align:start position:0%
recount so you may not know this but as
 
04:53:48.510 --> 04:53:48.520 align:start position:0%
I said my prior testimony before every
 
04:53:50.470 --> 04:53:50.480 align:start position:0%
election I get a team to go to City Hall
 
04:53:51.868 --> 04:53:51.878 align:start position:0%
we all volunteer and we count the number
 
04:53:53.470 --> 04:53:53.480 align:start position:0%
of ballots we receive from the Secretary
 
04:53:57.030 --> 04:53:57.040 align:start position:0%
of State to say this 5,500 he says it we
 
04:54:00.070 --> 04:54:00.080 align:start position:0%
we count that 5,500 quite often it's not
 
04:54:03.070 --> 04:54:03.080 align:start position:0%
accurate so it could be 5,600 at the end
 
04:54:04.990 --> 04:54:05.000 align:start position:0%
of ele every election night we open up
 
04:54:06.750 --> 04:54:06.760 align:start position:0%
tabulator we take out all those ballots
 
04:54:09.230 --> 04:54:09.240 align:start position:0%
and put them on tables and we pile them
 
04:54:11.548 --> 04:54:11.558 align:start position:0%
in piles and we count them anyways so
 
04:54:13.270 --> 04:54:13.280 align:start position:0%
the hand count is happening in every
 
04:54:15.430 --> 04:54:15.440 align:start position:0%
single election as a matter of course
 
04:54:17.910 --> 04:54:17.920 align:start position:0%
now all we're asking in this bill is
 
04:54:19.350 --> 04:54:19.360 align:start position:0%
that the attorney general and the
 
04:54:21.110 --> 04:54:21.120 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State stop interfering with
 
04:54:23.310 --> 04:54:23.320 align:start position:0%
the moderator if he wants to do this
 
04:54:25.270 --> 04:54:25.280 align:start position:0%
process and then we add this duty to the
 
04:54:26.910 --> 04:54:26.920 align:start position:0%
selectman in town clerk if they choose
 
04:54:29.510 --> 04:54:29.520 align:start position:0%
to do so so it's pretty simple in the in
 
04:54:30.990 --> 04:54:31.000 align:start position:0%
the governor's race which I was going to
 
04:54:32.350 --> 04:54:32.360 align:start position:0%
supplemental hand count I would have
 
04:54:34.190 --> 04:54:34.200 align:start position:0%
instructed my election workers to put
 
04:54:36.590 --> 04:54:36.600 align:start position:0%
the aot ballots in one pile the Craig
 
04:54:38.548 --> 04:54:38.558 align:start position:0%
ballots in another pile we would then
 
04:54:40.590 --> 04:54:40.600 align:start position:0%
count them add up the total of those
 
04:54:41.830 --> 04:54:41.840 align:start position:0%
piles to make sure we end up with the
 
04:54:43.788 --> 04:54:43.798 align:start position:0%
same amount of bar ballots and then
 
04:54:46.110 --> 04:54:46.120 align:start position:0%
Compare the aot numbers to the print out
 
04:54:47.750 --> 04:54:47.760 align:start position:0%
of the tape and compare the Craig
 
04:54:49.350 --> 04:54:49.360 align:start position:0%
numbers to the print out of the tape to
 
04:54:52.430 --> 04:54:52.440 align:start position:0%
make sure that it was accurate Hava the
 
04:54:54.390 --> 04:54:54.400 align:start position:0%
federal law says that our elections are
 
04:54:57.350 --> 04:54:57.360 align:start position:0%
in no trust system that means Dan hilly
 
04:54:59.750 --> 04:54:59.760 align:start position:0%
signed off that the machine is working
 
04:55:01.708 --> 04:55:01.718 align:start position:0%
but I can't trust him I have to test
 
04:55:03.470 --> 04:55:03.480 align:start position:0%
that in some manner so when I went to
 
04:55:04.910 --> 04:55:04.920 align:start position:0%
test that an election night I was
 
04:55:07.670 --> 04:55:07.680 align:start position:0%
threatened with committing a crime so
 
04:55:09.868 --> 04:55:09.878 align:start position:0%
you cannot operate as a moderator under
 
04:55:11.470 --> 04:55:11.480 align:start position:0%
these conditions particularly when the
 
04:55:13.030 --> 04:55:13.040 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State talks like he is the
 
04:55:14.990 --> 04:55:15.000 align:start position:0%
force of law you follows his
 
04:55:17.110 --> 04:55:17.120 align:start position:0%
instructions and if you are wrong he
 
04:55:19.230 --> 04:55:19.240 align:start position:0%
says it's your fault but if you are
 
04:55:21.070 --> 04:55:21.080 align:start position:0%
right he says you don't have the power
 
04:55:22.750 --> 04:55:22.760 align:start position:0%
and if you refer to page four of that
 
04:55:24.750 --> 04:55:24.760 align:start position:0%
election procedure manual it says right
 
04:55:26.590 --> 04:55:26.600 align:start position:0%
there this is not the law this is the
 
04:55:28.750 --> 04:55:28.760 align:start position:0%
opinion of the Secretary of State and I
 
04:55:30.310 --> 04:55:30.320 align:start position:0%
can tell you as a citizen who's just
 
04:55:32.510 --> 04:55:32.520 align:start position:0%
trying to do a good job at the other end
 
04:55:34.270 --> 04:55:34.280 align:start position:0%
of the phone on from the attorney
 
04:55:35.750 --> 04:55:35.760 align:start position:0%
general at a call at the end of election
 
04:55:37.910 --> 04:55:37.920 align:start position:0%
night is's no place that you want to be
 
04:55:39.990 --> 04:55:40.000 align:start position:0%
that's why I'm here because we have this
 
04:55:42.510 --> 04:55:42.520 align:start position:0%
power anyways the legislature needs to
 
04:55:45.628 --> 04:55:45.638 align:start position:0%
remind the powers that be the moderators
 
04:55:47.350 --> 04:55:47.360 align:start position:0%
at their discretion can do these hand
 
04:55:48.868 --> 04:55:48.878 align:start position:0%
counts they should not be interfered
 
04:55:51.230 --> 04:55:51.240 align:start position:0%
with I'll take any questions okay are
 
04:55:53.190 --> 04:55:53.200 align:start position:0%
there questions from the committee
 
04:55:53.200 --> 04:55:54.270 align:start position:0%
there questions from the committee
representative

04:55:54.270 --> 04:55:54.280 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:55:57.548 --> 04:55:57.558 align:start position:0%
Lane thank you for taking my question um
 
04:56:00.830 --> 04:56:00.840 align:start position:0%
you mentioned a a Supreme Court case yes
 
04:56:03.430 --> 04:56:03.440 align:start position:0%
I can give this to you I can you talk
 
04:56:05.788 --> 04:56:05.798 align:start position:0%
very quickly so I couldn't jot it down
 
04:56:07.868 --> 04:56:07.878 align:start position:0%
so I'm so sorry I'm a little bit nervous
 
04:56:09.910 --> 04:56:09.920 align:start position:0%
well you're doing a great job so don't
 
04:56:12.430 --> 04:56:12.440 align:start position:0%
so the the opinion of the justices 53n
 
04:56:13.948 --> 04:56:13.958 align:start position:0%
640 nh1
 
04:56:16.788 --> 04:56:16.798 align:start position:0%
1873 was a case in which the city clerk
 
04:56:18.910 --> 04:56:18.920 align:start position:0%
reported an an incorrection invalid vote
 
04:56:20.948 --> 04:56:20.958 align:start position:0%
number okay so the purpose of the case
 
04:56:22.990 --> 04:56:23.000 align:start position:0%
was to correct who had the authority to
 
04:56:25.470 --> 04:56:25.480 align:start position:0%
adjust that incorrect count and did the
 
04:56:26.990 --> 04:56:27.000 align:start position:0%
city clerk or the town clerk have the
 
04:56:28.948 --> 04:56:28.958 align:start position:0%
authority to override the moderator and
 
04:56:31.510 --> 04:56:31.520 align:start position:0%
the justice has said no that the city
 
04:56:33.510 --> 04:56:33.520 align:start position:0%
clerk cannot correct a mistake by the
 
04:56:36.150 --> 04:56:36.160 align:start position:0%
moderator the Selectmen uh during the
 
04:56:37.708 --> 04:56:37.718 align:start position:0%
election I can do that but I will submit
 
04:56:40.750 --> 04:56:40.760 align:start position:0%
this for everyone to read
 
04:56:43.070 --> 04:56:43.080 align:start position:0%
further questions representative Newsome
 
04:56:44.150 --> 04:56:44.160 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking the
 
04:56:46.030 --> 04:56:46.040 align:start position:0%
question um I was a little confused by
 
04:56:47.868 --> 04:56:47.878 align:start position:0%
your testimony it
 
04:56:50.110 --> 04:56:50.120 align:start position:0%
seemed to say at one point that the
 
04:56:52.628 --> 04:56:52.638 align:start position:0%
machines are tested before the election
 
04:56:54.030 --> 04:56:54.040 align:start position:0%
but then you said they weren't tested
 
04:56:55.830 --> 04:56:55.840 align:start position:0%
before the election what I'm saying is
 
04:56:59.110 --> 04:56:59.120 align:start position:0%
LHS systems uh owns the proprietary
 
04:57:00.750 --> 04:57:00.760 align:start position:0%
software for the tabulators at least for
 
04:57:03.430 --> 04:57:03.440 align:start position:0%
ASA so LHS systems as far as I
 
04:57:05.430 --> 04:57:05.440 align:start position:0%
understand the process is that prior to
 
04:57:07.390 --> 04:57:07.400 align:start position:0%
the election the city clerk Dan Haley
 
04:57:10.190 --> 04:57:10.200 align:start position:0%
very good man he and LHS systems test
 
04:57:11.310 --> 04:57:11.320 align:start position:0%
the machines to make sure they're
 
04:57:12.628 --> 04:57:12.638 align:start position:0%
accurate in other words I think they run
 
04:57:14.868 --> 04:57:14.878 align:start position:0%
like 50 ballots through look at the tape
 
04:57:16.590 --> 04:57:16.600 align:start position:0%
and make sure it says 50 ballots so an
 
04:57:19.270 --> 04:57:19.280 align:start position:0%
election morning I Reed the tabulator
 
04:57:20.830 --> 04:57:20.840 align:start position:0%
and it's signed off by danan Healey that
 
04:57:23.270 --> 04:57:23.280 align:start position:0%
it's working properly all I do is sign
 
04:57:24.590 --> 04:57:24.600 align:start position:0%
that yeah that's the evidence that's
 
04:57:26.750 --> 04:57:26.760 align:start position:0%
working properly but I have no evidence
 
04:57:28.948 --> 04:57:28.958 align:start position:0%
that it's working I didn't do the test
 
04:57:31.070 --> 04:57:31.080 align:start position:0%
and if you look at look up Harry Hy on
 
04:57:32.590 --> 04:57:32.600 align:start position:0%
YouTube you can see how easy it is to
 
04:57:34.230 --> 04:57:34.240 align:start position:0%
manipulate the memory cards in these
 
04:57:37.070 --> 04:57:37.080 align:start position:0%
machines so I think I'm answering your
 
04:57:38.390 --> 04:57:38.400 align:start position:0%
question but I don't do the test
 
04:57:39.910 --> 04:57:39.920 align:start position:0%
personally as the moderator I just sign
 
04:57:41.590 --> 04:57:41.600 align:start position:0%
off that it was
 
04:57:43.868 --> 04:57:43.878 align:start position:0%
tested I just wanted to confirm that yes
 
04:57:45.150 --> 04:57:45.160 align:start position:0%
you answered the question that the
 
04:57:47.910 --> 04:57:47.920 align:start position:0%
moderator for the city is the one doing
 
04:57:50.110 --> 04:57:50.120 align:start position:0%
that test no the city clerk and LHS
 
04:57:52.788 --> 04:57:52.798 align:start position:0%
systems City cler LHS systems does test
 
04:57:54.910 --> 04:57:54.920 align:start position:0%
city clerk thank you and quick followup
 
04:57:55.948 --> 04:57:55.958 align:start position:0%
though I got to go to representative
 
04:57:59.110 --> 04:57:59.120 align:start position:0%
toner first he's flaged in no
 
04:58:02.310 --> 04:58:02.320 align:start position:0%
problem um I just had a quick question
 
04:58:07.510 --> 04:58:07.520 align:start position:0%
um so in my town uh there was a defect
 
04:58:09.910 --> 04:58:09.920 align:start position:0%
in the circuitry of the bo of the of the
 
04:58:12.390 --> 04:58:12.400 align:start position:0%
V voting machine on when they performed
 
04:58:14.070 --> 04:58:14.080 align:start position:0%
their test the parent
 
04:58:16.750 --> 04:58:16.760 align:start position:0%
test it worked and the day of the
 
04:58:19.030 --> 04:58:19.040 align:start position:0%
election it didn't work and then someone
 
04:58:21.470 --> 04:58:21.480 align:start position:0%
ran a circuit
 
04:58:23.868 --> 04:58:23.878 align:start position:0%
board what what is your opinion of a
 
04:58:26.070 --> 04:58:26.080 align:start position:0%
situation like that that occurs like in
 
04:58:27.788 --> 04:58:27.798 align:start position:0%
my in my understanding there was no test
 
04:58:29.270 --> 04:58:29.280 align:start position:0%
run on the second circuit
 
04:58:30.990 --> 04:58:31.000 align:start position:0%
board then they should have handc
 
04:58:32.230 --> 04:58:32.240 align:start position:0%
counted the entire race because you
 
04:58:33.230 --> 04:58:33.240 align:start position:0%
don't know what that circuit board is
 
04:58:34.270 --> 04:58:34.280 align:start position:0%
going to produce you don't know who
 
04:58:35.628 --> 04:58:35.638 align:start position:0%
programmed that circuit board and like
 
04:58:37.390 --> 04:58:37.400 align:start position:0%
as a senior software analyst that
 
04:58:38.628 --> 04:58:38.638 align:start position:0%
circuit board could do whatever the
 
04:58:42.910 --> 04:58:42.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:45.708 --> 04:58:45.718 align:start position:0%
further questions seeing none thank you
 
04:58:47.910 --> 04:58:47.920 align:start position:0%
I don't have any more pink cards should
 
04:58:52.510 --> 04:58:52.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:56.788 --> 04:58:56.798 align:start position:0%
please and then 263 uh was 10 in
 
04:58:58.910 --> 04:58:58.920 align:start position:0%
supports 23
 
04:59:02.470 --> 04:59:02.480 align:start position:0%
right and 236 opposed one
 
04:59:02.480 --> 04:59:04.628 align:start position:0%
right and 236 opposed one
neutral

04:59:04.628 --> 04:59:04.638 align:start position:0%
neutral
 
04:59:08.030 --> 04:59:08.040 align:start position:0%
so what fluide I I think I did see
 
04:59:13.868 --> 04:59:13.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:15.548 --> 04:59:15.558 align:start position:0%
you think you think I don't look but I
 
04:59:19.510 --> 04:59:19.520 align:start position:0%
do look um on the blue sheet is one in
 
04:59:21.590 --> 04:59:21.600 align:start position:0%
support one against and with that we'll
 
04:59:23.910 --> 04:59:23.920 align:start position:0%
close the public hearing for House
 
04:59:26.990 --> 04:59:27.000 align:start position:0%
Bill 693 and we will open the public
 
04:59:29.510 --> 04:59:29.520 align:start position:0%
hearing for House Bill 274 represent
 
04:59:31.590 --> 04:59:31.600 align:start position:0%
recognize our own representative Wei for
 
04:59:33.150 --> 04:59:33.160 align:start position:0%
the purpose of
 
04:59:34.830 --> 04:59:34.840 align:start position:0%
introduction why were they booing
 
04:59:37.110 --> 04:59:37.120 align:start position:0%
representative booze I heard booze all
 
04:59:37.120 --> 04:59:40.670 align:start position:0%
representative booze I heard booze all
right

04:59:40.670 --> 04:59:40.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:42.390 --> 04:59:42.400 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and honorable
 
04:59:43.910 --> 04:59:43.920 align:start position:0%
committee members for the record my name
 
04:59:45.510 --> 04:59:45.520 align:start position:0%
is Bob war and have the privilege of
 
04:59:47.548 --> 04:59:47.558 align:start position:0%
representing Hillsboro District 13 the
 
04:59:48.990 --> 04:59:49.000 align:start position:0%
great town of
 
04:59:52.948 --> 04:59:52.958 align:start position:0%
Hudson RSA 65439 currently calls for the
 
04:59:55.390 --> 04:59:55.400 align:start position:0%
verification of the voter roles every 10
 
04:59:57.628 --> 04:59:57.638 align:start position:0%
years in what is you euphemistically
 
05:00:00.310 --> 05:00:00.320 align:start position:0%
known as the voter role Purge this
 
05:00:02.670 --> 05:00:02.680 align:start position:0%
verification looks to remove voters who
 
05:00:04.590 --> 05:00:04.600 align:start position:0%
have not voted in a number of Elections
 
05:00:07.510 --> 05:00:07.520 align:start position:0%
or have moved but did not form but did
 
05:00:10.350 --> 05:00:10.360 align:start position:0%
not inform the state or who have died by
 
05:00:12.270 --> 05:00:12.280 align:start position:0%
current statute this 10-year cycle
 
05:00:14.230 --> 05:00:14.240 align:start position:0%
occurs on the year ending in one most
 
05:00:17.670 --> 05:00:17.680 align:start position:0%
recently 2021 famously the Great Purge
 
05:00:20.190 --> 05:00:20.200 align:start position:0%
of 2021 removed approximately a quarter
 
05:00:22.110 --> 05:00:22.120 align:start position:0%
of a million voters from the New
 
05:00:23.628 --> 05:00:23.638 align:start position:0%
Hampshire voter roles reducing the
 
05:00:26.670 --> 05:00:26.680 align:start position:0%
number of Voters from approximately
 
05:00:30.910 --> 05:00:30.920 align:start position:0%
1.12 million to approximately 880,000
 
05:00:33.590 --> 05:00:33.600 align:start position:0%
voters by Statute the verifications
 
05:00:36.150 --> 05:00:36.160 align:start position:0%
currently have a look back of a 4-year
 
05:00:38.430 --> 05:00:38.440 align:start position:0%
duration whereby if the voter has been
 
05:00:41.270 --> 05:00:41.280 align:start position:0%
active in any local primary or general
 
05:00:43.390 --> 05:00:43.400 align:start position:0%
election they are not removed from the
 
05:00:46.708 --> 05:00:46.718 align:start position:0%
voter roles in 2024 I observed the
 
05:00:48.510 --> 05:00:48.520 align:start position:0%
working sessions of the supervisor of
 
05:00:50.030 --> 05:00:50.040 align:start position:0%
the checklist for my local town of
 
05:00:52.910 --> 05:00:52.920 align:start position:0%
Hudson in the three short years since
 
05:00:56.270 --> 05:00:56.280 align:start position:0%
the 2021 Purge Hudson has had over 900
 
05:00:58.590 --> 05:00:58.600 align:start position:0%
people who could be potentially purged
 
05:01:02.830 --> 05:01:02.840 align:start position:0%
from the current voter roles in the 2024
 
05:01:04.830 --> 05:01:04.840 align:start position:0%
general election Hudson saw nearly
 
05:01:07.628 --> 05:01:07.638 align:start position:0%
15,000 people voting so in rough figures
 
05:01:09.910 --> 05:01:09.920 align:start position:0%
approximately 6% of the voter roles were
 
05:01:12.150 --> 05:01:12.160 align:start position:0%
effective that's a ma massive amount of
 
05:01:14.990 --> 05:01:15.000 align:start position:0%
work to deal with uh 900 letters along
 
05:01:18.708 --> 05:01:18.718 align:start position:0%
with u follow-up letters and so on so
 
05:01:21.670 --> 05:01:21.680 align:start position:0%
people are uh heading to New Hampshire
 
05:01:23.270 --> 05:01:23.280 align:start position:0%
to take advantage of the many freedoms
 
05:01:25.350 --> 05:01:25.360 align:start position:0%
to Live Free or Die state offers perhaps
 
05:01:27.190 --> 05:01:27.200 align:start position:0%
they are simply fleeing the People's
 
05:01:29.190 --> 05:01:29.200 align:start position:0%
Republic of Massachusetts regardless of
 
05:01:31.110 --> 05:01:31.120 align:start position:0%
their motivations New Hampshire is
 
05:01:33.230 --> 05:01:33.240 align:start position:0%
experiencing a steady growth rate
 
05:01:35.990 --> 05:01:36.000 align:start position:0%
particularly in the southern areas
 
05:01:37.670 --> 05:01:37.680 align:start position:0%
therefore it seems appropriate to
 
05:01:39.310 --> 05:01:39.320 align:start position:0%
decrease the interval in which voter
 
05:01:42.030 --> 05:01:42.040 align:start position:0%
verification are done to compensate for
 
05:01:44.270 --> 05:01:44.280 align:start position:0%
this increased frequency the bill also
 
05:01:46.110 --> 05:01:46.120 align:start position:0%
extends the look back on voter activity
 
05:01:48.750 --> 05:01:48.760 align:start position:0%
from a 4-year to a 5-year duration this
 
05:01:50.670 --> 05:01:50.680 align:start position:0%
allows a look back to include at least
 
05:01:53.470 --> 05:01:53.480 align:start position:0%
one presidential general election which
 
05:01:55.310 --> 05:01:55.320 align:start position:0%
of course is the election having the
 
05:01:57.910 --> 05:01:57.920 align:start position:0%
greatest voter turnout this increased
 
05:01:59.750 --> 05:01:59.760 align:start position:0%
frequency of verification along with the
 
05:02:02.030 --> 05:02:02.040 align:start position:0%
increased look back duration will result
 
05:02:04.430 --> 05:02:04.440 align:start position:0%
in at least three benefits one more
 
05:02:06.510 --> 05:02:06.520 align:start position:0%
accurate checklist who wouldn't want
 
05:02:09.350 --> 05:02:09.360 align:start position:0%
that uh Second lower and less stressful
 
05:02:11.390 --> 05:02:11.400 align:start position:0%
workloads for the supervisors of the
 
05:02:13.430 --> 05:02:13.440 align:start position:0%
checklist that is the ongoing annual
 
05:02:15.590 --> 05:02:15.600 align:start position:0%
performance of the voter verification
 
05:02:17.830 --> 05:02:17.840 align:start position:0%
will be far less stressful than the
 
05:02:19.510 --> 05:02:19.520 align:start position:0%
massive undertaking required when the
 
05:02:22.110 --> 05:02:22.120 align:start position:0%
verification is only performed every 10
 
05:02:24.670 --> 05:02:24.680 align:start position:0%
years and three more consistency in the
 
05:02:26.708 --> 05:02:26.718 align:start position:0%
voter verification practice by
 
05:02:28.670 --> 05:02:28.680 align:start position:0%
performing this verification annually
 
05:02:31.230 --> 05:02:31.240 align:start position:0%
the supervisors of the checklist will be
 
05:02:33.110 --> 05:02:33.120 align:start position:0%
more readily familiar with the process
 
05:02:35.230 --> 05:02:35.240 align:start position:0%
and should have an easier time
 
05:02:39.470 --> 05:02:39.480 align:start position:0%
completing the verific verification task
 
05:02:41.750 --> 05:02:41.760 align:start position:0%
I also note that uh with the bill we
 
05:02:44.990 --> 05:02:45.000 align:start position:0%
heard earlier HB 341 if that's taking
 
05:02:46.670 --> 05:02:46.680 align:start position:0%
care of the address changes with the
 
05:02:48.948 --> 05:02:48.958 align:start position:0%
national change of address information
 
05:02:51.070 --> 05:02:51.080 align:start position:0%
then this verification would address
 
05:02:52.750 --> 05:02:52.760 align:start position:0%
voters who have died or who have been
 
05:02:55.788 --> 05:02:55.798 align:start position:0%
inactive and so uh I think the two bills
 
05:02:58.110 --> 05:02:58.120 align:start position:0%
in tandem would certainly give us
 
05:03:01.070 --> 05:03:01.080 align:start position:0%
extremely accurate checklists I would be
 
05:03:03.230 --> 05:03:03.240 align:start position:0%
glad to try and answer any questions the
 
05:03:05.548 --> 05:03:05.558 align:start position:0%
committee may have are there questions
 
05:03:08.150 --> 05:03:08.160 align:start position:0%
from the committee representative Lane I
 
05:03:11.270 --> 05:03:11.280 align:start position:0%
was I was I just knew just knew you just
 
05:03:13.190 --> 05:03:13.200 align:start position:0%
knew I I didn't even I I I I didn't see
 
05:03:15.110 --> 05:03:15.120 align:start position:0%
you raise your hand honestly I
 
05:03:18.150 --> 05:03:18.160 align:start position:0%
just so I seem to have misplaced my copy
 
05:03:20.030 --> 05:03:20.040 align:start position:0%
of the bill but um that's okay I've
 
05:03:22.190 --> 05:03:22.200 align:start position:0%
already discussed it a little bit with
 
05:03:26.150 --> 05:03:26.160 align:start position:0%
representative uh weie um this is uh
 
05:03:28.628 --> 05:03:28.638 align:start position:0%
similar to a bill that we saw last year
 
05:03:30.190 --> 05:03:30.200 align:start position:0%
uh HB
 
05:03:34.868 --> 05:03:34.878 align:start position:0%
1369 and in that bill uh it was a review
 
05:03:40.510 --> 05:03:40.520 align:start position:0%
every four years not annually and
 
05:03:44.230 --> 05:03:44.240 align:start position:0%
then it looked back over six years and
 
05:03:47.390 --> 05:03:47.400 align:start position:0%
because of that we were able to capture
 
05:03:49.910 --> 05:03:49.920 align:start position:0%
two presidential elections so for
 
05:03:52.910 --> 05:03:52.920 align:start position:0%
instance if you missed one there was a
 
05:03:54.910 --> 05:03:54.920 align:start position:0%
second one so in order to have gotten
 
05:03:57.190 --> 05:03:57.200 align:start position:0%
bumped off the roles you would have had
 
05:04:00.030 --> 05:04:00.040 align:start position:0%
to have missed two presidential
 
05:04:02.948 --> 05:04:02.958 align:start position:0%
elections so I guess I would just like
 
05:04:08.310 --> 05:04:08.320 align:start position:0%
you to speak to why now only one because
 
05:04:10.430 --> 05:04:10.440 align:start position:0%
whether we like it or not
 
05:04:13.030 --> 05:04:13.040 align:start position:0%
as you indicated that's when most we get
 
05:04:15.910 --> 05:04:15.920 align:start position:0%
more votes more voters yeah I can't
 
05:04:17.830 --> 05:04:17.840 align:start position:0%
speak for all areas but certainly we see
 
05:04:20.708 --> 05:04:20.718 align:start position:0%
almost a three times uh the local
 
05:04:23.510 --> 05:04:23.520 align:start position:0%
election turnout for voter election uh
 
05:04:28.430 --> 05:04:28.440 align:start position:0%
in Hudson I think generally the voting
 
05:04:29.948 --> 05:04:29.958 align:start position:0%
populace within New Hampshire is
 
05:04:33.310 --> 05:04:33.320 align:start position:0%
energized for the uh presidential races
 
05:04:37.110 --> 05:04:37.120 align:start position:0%
and therefore um very few people miss it
 
05:04:40.230 --> 05:04:40.240 align:start position:0%
and so we and usually the ones who miss
 
05:04:44.470 --> 05:04:44.480 align:start position:0%
it would would uh certainly be able to
 
05:04:47.150 --> 05:04:47.160 align:start position:0%
when they receive a letter uh from the
 
05:04:49.750 --> 05:04:49.760 align:start position:0%
supervisor the checklist explained why
 
05:04:51.470 --> 05:04:51.480 align:start position:0%
they might have been in active in that
 
05:04:54.070 --> 05:04:54.080 align:start position:0%
last presidential race and therefore I
 
05:04:56.270 --> 05:04:56.280 align:start position:0%
think that we just need one presidential
 
05:04:57.830 --> 05:04:57.840 align:start position:0%
race to look back on I don't think we
 
05:05:00.070 --> 05:05:00.080 align:start position:0%
need multiple
 
05:05:00.080 --> 05:05:01.788 align:start position:0%
need multiple
ones

05:05:01.788 --> 05:05:01.798 align:start position:0%
ones
 
05:05:06.788 --> 05:05:06.798 align:start position:0%
sure uh why an annual review rather than
 
05:05:09.470 --> 05:05:09.480 align:start position:0%
every four years the way you had it set
 
05:05:10.830 --> 05:05:10.840 align:start position:0%
up last
 
05:05:13.470 --> 05:05:13.480 align:start position:0%
year it's really just uh for that
 
05:05:15.788 --> 05:05:15.798 align:start position:0%
consistency and and reducing the overall
 
05:05:17.788 --> 05:05:17.798 align:start position:0%
workload year-to-year um so it's like
 
05:05:19.670 --> 05:05:19.680 align:start position:0%
dollar cost averaging for investment you
 
05:05:21.868 --> 05:05:21.878 align:start position:0%
know this is just consistently doing
 
05:05:24.510 --> 05:05:24.520 align:start position:0%
this practice year after year after year
 
05:05:29.510 --> 05:05:29.520 align:start position:0%
it it keeps the the uh voter
 
05:05:33.030 --> 05:05:33.040 align:start position:0%
checklists as accurate as possible in in
 
05:05:36.830 --> 05:05:36.840 align:start position:0%
between the national change of address
 
05:05:40.310 --> 05:05:40.320 align:start position:0%
uh database information as well as as
 
05:05:42.948 --> 05:05:42.958 align:start position:0%
the ability to look for uh people who
 
05:05:45.830 --> 05:05:45.840 align:start position:0%
have been inactive in the previous 5
 
05:05:49.070 --> 05:05:49.080 align:start position:0%
years now as this bill would propose and
 
05:05:52.270 --> 05:05:52.280 align:start position:0%
anyone who has passed on then that would
 
05:05:55.628 --> 05:05:55.638 align:start position:0%
allow for very consistent and
 
05:06:00.030 --> 05:06:00.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:02.230 --> 05:06:02.240 align:start position:0%
checklists yes I'm so surprised you want
 
05:06:05.030 --> 05:06:05.040 align:start position:0%
one more one more wow thank you anybody
 
05:06:07.270 --> 05:06:07.280 align:start position:0%
else can join in
 
05:06:09.710 --> 05:06:09.720 align:start position:0%
um would you be willing
 
05:06:09.720 --> 05:06:13.510 align:start position:0%
um would you be willing
[Laughter]

05:06:13.510 --> 05:06:13.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:15.910 --> 05:06:15.920 align:start position:0%
which I'm sorry I don't know if you I
 
05:06:17.310 --> 05:06:17.320 align:start position:0%
don't know if you heard what any I did
 
05:06:19.030 --> 05:06:19.040 align:start position:0%
not but that's okay I'm sure he can tell
 
05:06:19.040 --> 05:06:20.190 align:start position:0%
not but that's okay I'm sure he can tell
me

05:06:20.190 --> 05:06:20.200 align:start position:0%
me
 
05:06:23.948 --> 05:06:23.958 align:start position:0%
later um now I lost my oh would you be
 
05:06:26.670 --> 05:06:26.680 align:start position:0%
willing would you be willing to consider
 
05:06:30.830 --> 05:06:30.840 align:start position:0%
looking back further to get two periods
 
05:06:34.628 --> 05:06:34.638 align:start position:0%
if we're going to an annual one could we
 
05:06:37.110 --> 05:06:37.120 align:start position:0%
extend it out so like last time we did
 
05:06:40.110 --> 05:06:40.120 align:start position:0%
it so you could capture two or is that
 
05:06:43.548 --> 05:06:43.558 align:start position:0%
just GE mathematically not possible I
 
05:06:45.990 --> 05:06:46.000 align:start position:0%
haven't done the math so I don't
 
05:06:48.270 --> 05:06:48.280 align:start position:0%
know I haven't done the I haven't done
 
05:06:51.750 --> 05:06:51.760 align:start position:0%
the math either um I'd
 
05:06:55.110 --> 05:06:55.120 align:start position:0%
be I know that there is a similar Bill
 
05:06:57.470 --> 05:06:57.480 align:start position:0%
to this coming from the other side of
 
05:07:01.590 --> 05:07:01.600 align:start position:0%
the wall so I would be curious as to
 
05:07:04.910 --> 05:07:04.920 align:start position:0%
what their position is because we would
 
05:07:06.350 --> 05:07:06.360 align:start position:0%
no doubt have
 
05:07:10.350 --> 05:07:10.360 align:start position:0%
to come to some sort of mutual agreement
 
05:07:14.030 --> 05:07:14.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:17.030 --> 05:07:17.040 align:start position:0%
think again I I I think the annual
 
05:07:19.430 --> 05:07:19.440 align:start position:0%
verification has its benefits regardless
 
05:07:25.230 --> 05:07:25.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:28.590 --> 05:07:28.600 align:start position:0%
I so I I think I I might be amendable
 
05:07:30.470 --> 05:07:30.480 align:start position:0%
but I I think there are F other factors
 
05:07:32.470 --> 05:07:32.480 align:start position:0%
that we need to consider before we
 
05:07:35.270 --> 05:07:35.280 align:start position:0%
completely move forward on an amendment
 
05:07:37.670 --> 05:07:37.680 align:start position:0%
in that direction you never know what
 
05:07:40.390 --> 05:07:40.400 align:start position:0%
they're going to do over there
 
05:07:42.470 --> 05:07:42.480 align:start position:0%
new did you have a question okay would
 
05:07:45.628 --> 05:07:45.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:48.070 --> 05:07:48.080 align:start position:0%
one further questions from the
 
05:07:50.390 --> 05:07:50.400 align:start position:0%
committee all right seeing none thank
 
05:07:52.750 --> 05:07:52.760 align:start position:0%
you um I don't think I have any more
 
05:07:54.110 --> 05:07:54.120 align:start position:0%
pink cards for this does anybody else
 
05:07:56.548 --> 05:07:56.558 align:start position:0%
wish to speak to this I I put down 30
 
05:07:57.868 --> 05:07:57.878 align:start position:0%
ministers because I thought there would
 
05:07:59.350 --> 05:07:59.360 align:start position:0%
be a parade of people like there
 
05:08:01.990 --> 05:08:02.000 align:start position:0%
normally are and then I guess our
 
05:08:03.830 --> 05:08:03.840 align:start position:0%
friends in the left disappointed me so
 
05:08:06.708 --> 05:08:06.718 align:start position:0%
where's the love I where's the hate I
 
05:08:09.190 --> 05:08:09.200 align:start position:0%
don't know it's either way it's not here
 
05:08:12.270 --> 05:08:12.280 align:start position:0%
um all right with that we'll go online
 
05:08:13.788 --> 05:08:13.798 align:start position:0%
maybe maybe they express themselves
 
05:08:17.150 --> 05:08:17.160 align:start position:0%
online let's find out
 
05:08:20.990 --> 05:08:21.000 align:start position:0%
274 or maybe it's just more fluoride who
 
05:08:26.310 --> 05:08:26.320 align:start position:0%
knows yeah uh 23 in support 124
 
05:08:30.150 --> 05:08:30.160 align:start position:0%
against um one neutral and yes fluoride
 
05:08:30.160 --> 05:08:31.750 align:start position:0%
against um one neutral and yes fluoride
was

05:08:31.750 --> 05:08:31.760 align:start position:0%
was
 
05:08:35.310 --> 05:08:35.320 align:start position:0%
there um signed up against was uh Sarah
 
05:08:36.548 --> 05:08:36.558 align:start position:0%
Bert con with the New Hampshire
 
05:08:36.558 --> 05:08:37.548 align:start position:0%

Municipal
 
05:08:40.270 --> 05:08:40.280 align:start position:0%
Association uh with that we stand in
 
05:08:43.190 --> 05:08:43.200 align:start position:0%
recess till 320 my apologies I thought
 
05:08:44.990 --> 05:08:45.000 align:start position:0%

reopen the public hearings for house
 
05:22:41.230 --> 05:22:41.240 align:start position:0%
election law committee going to open up
 
05:22:42.628 --> 05:22:42.638 align:start position:0%
public heing for House Bill 317
 
05:22:43.910 --> 05:22:43.920 align:start position:0%
preventing a supervisor of the checklist
 
05:22:45.230 --> 05:22:45.240 align:start position:0%
from verifying a person's identity
 
05:22:47.070 --> 05:22:47.080 align:start position:0%
without identification even if they
 
05:22:49.190 --> 05:22:49.200 align:start position:0%

5 I'm introducing HB 317 a bill
 
05:23:12.548 --> 05:23:12.558 align:start position:0%
preventing a supervisor of the checklist
 
05:23:15.830 --> 05:23:15.840 align:start position:0%
and it does actually State other uh
 
05:23:15.840 --> 05:23:16.910 align:start position:0%
and it does actually State other uh
election

05:23:16.910 --> 05:23:16.920 align:start position:0%
election
 
05:23:19.670 --> 05:23:19.680 align:start position:0%
officials um from verifying a person's
 
05:23:22.590 --> 05:23:22.600 align:start position:0%
identity without identification even if
 
05:23:25.430 --> 05:23:25.440 align:start position:0%
they personally know that person I've
 
05:23:27.750 --> 05:23:27.760 align:start position:0%
actually seen this happen many times
 
05:23:30.470 --> 05:23:30.480 align:start position:0%
where someone shows up without
 
05:23:32.270 --> 05:23:32.280 align:start position:0%
identification and because they know
 
05:23:34.830 --> 05:23:34.840 align:start position:0%
them they just kind of let them in and
 
05:23:39.788 --> 05:23:39.798 align:start position:0%
that's okay apparently um
 
05:23:41.708 --> 05:23:41.718 align:start position:0%
election should be a fair and equal
 
05:23:44.310 --> 05:23:44.320 align:start position:0%
opportunity for every voter including
 
05:23:46.590 --> 05:23:46.600 align:start position:0%
when they show their identification
 
05:23:48.788 --> 05:23:48.798 align:start position:0%
regardless if they know an election
 
05:23:51.390 --> 05:23:51.400 align:start position:0%
official others have shown disdain when
 
05:23:53.868 --> 05:23:53.878 align:start position:0%
seeing others voting voters check in
 
05:23:56.190 --> 05:23:56.200 align:start position:0%
without showing identification I've seen
 
05:23:59.150 --> 05:23:59.160 align:start position:0%
that as well and um so we would just
 
05:24:03.390 --> 05:24:03.400 align:start position:0%
like to um encourage consistency to all
 
05:24:06.230 --> 05:24:06.240 align:start position:0%
and to make sure that every voter is
 
05:24:09.510 --> 05:24:09.520 align:start position:0%
able to be verified equally and
 
05:24:12.390 --> 05:24:12.400 align:start position:0%
consistently so thank you for your
 
05:24:14.190 --> 05:24:14.200 align:start position:0%
consideration and I'll take any
 
05:24:16.030 --> 05:24:16.040 align:start position:0%

house election law my name is Linda
 
05:24:43.670 --> 05:24:43.680 align:start position:0%
Bundy and I'm from antrum I oppose HB
 
05:24:46.070 --> 05:24:46.080 align:start position:0%
317 preventing a supervisor of the
 
05:24:48.150 --> 05:24:48.160 align:start position:0%
checklist from verifying a person's
 
05:24:51.030 --> 05:24:51.040 align:start position:0%
identity without identification even if
 
05:24:53.788 --> 05:24:53.798 align:start position:0%
they personally know that person I
 
05:24:55.708 --> 05:24:55.718 align:start position:0%
believe there is no need for this change
 
05:24:58.270 --> 05:24:58.280 align:start position:0%
to the voting laws the people most
 
05:25:00.350 --> 05:25:00.360 align:start position:0%
likely to not have their ID with them
 
05:25:02.230 --> 05:25:02.240 align:start position:0%
are working people fitting in voting on
 
05:25:04.350 --> 05:25:04.360 align:start position:0%
their way to or from their places of
 
05:25:07.390 --> 05:25:07.400 align:start position:0%
employment elderly people or those with
 
05:25:07.400 --> 05:25:09.270 align:start position:0%
employment elderly people or those with
disabilities

05:25:09.270 --> 05:25:09.280 align:start position:0%
disabilities
 
05:25:11.150 --> 05:25:11.160 align:start position:0%
election workers take an oath at the
 
05:25:13.590 --> 05:25:13.600 align:start position:0%
beginning of the day in keeping that
 
05:25:16.430 --> 05:25:16.440 align:start position:0%
oath they would only verify a person's
 
05:25:18.510 --> 05:25:18.520 align:start position:0%
identification if it were
 
05:25:22.190 --> 05:25:22.200 align:start position:0%
true two of the Anum supervisors of the
 
05:25:24.830 --> 05:25:24.840 align:start position:0%
checklist stated to me that they oppose
 
05:25:27.708 --> 05:25:27.718 align:start position:0%

policy fellow with open democracy and I
 
05:26:17.750 --> 05:26:17.760 align:start position:0%
am testifying today in opposition to HB
 
05:26:20.470 --> 05:26:20.480 align:start position:0%
317 it is well known that the moderators
 
05:26:22.310 --> 05:26:22.320 align:start position:0%
clerks and supervisors of New Hampshire
 
05:26:23.788 --> 05:26:23.798 align:start position:0%
handle their duties with the utmost
 
05:26:25.750 --> 05:26:25.760 align:start position:0%
levels of responsibility and care as
 
05:26:27.310 --> 05:26:27.320 align:start position:0%
we've had the pleasure to hear this
 
05:26:30.150 --> 05:26:30.160 align:start position:0%
afternoon simply put this bill implies
 
05:26:32.270 --> 05:26:32.280 align:start position:0%
otherwise like many other bills this
 
05:26:35.310 --> 05:26:35.320 align:start position:0%
session HB 317 provides a solution for a
 
05:26:37.470 --> 05:26:37.480 align:start position:0%
problem that has yet to arise while
 
05:26:39.070 --> 05:26:39.080 align:start position:0%
levels of voter fraud in the state are
 
05:26:41.230 --> 05:26:41.240 align:start position:0%
minuscule those perpetrated by checklist
 
05:26:43.070 --> 05:26:43.080 align:start position:0%
supervisors greeting their neighbor and
 
05:26:44.510 --> 05:26:44.520 align:start position:0%
pointing them in the direction of the
 
05:26:46.548 --> 05:26:46.558 align:start position:0%
polls are virtually
 
05:26:48.788 --> 05:26:48.798 align:start position:0%
non-existent think of the local Grandma
 
05:26:50.708 --> 05:26:50.718 align:start position:0%
who is eager to cast her vote but forgot
 
05:26:52.628 --> 05:26:52.638 align:start position:0%
her driver's license at home the
 
05:26:54.590 --> 05:26:54.600 align:start position:0%
disabled Community who already face
 
05:26:56.190 --> 05:26:56.200 align:start position:0%
significant challenges in getting to the
 
05:26:59.110 --> 05:26:59.120 align:start position:0%
polls the forgetful everyday citizen who
 
05:27:00.708 --> 05:27:00.718 align:start position:0%
breathes a sigh of relief when they see
 
05:27:02.270 --> 05:27:02.280 align:start position:0%
the clerk they know well working the
 
05:27:04.830 --> 05:27:04.840 align:start position:0%
voter check-in table for this bill to go
 
05:27:06.788 --> 05:27:06.798 align:start position:0%
into effect it would not work to prevent
 
05:27:08.830 --> 05:27:08.840 align:start position:0%
fraud and let's face it those who dared
 
05:27:10.910 --> 05:27:10.920 align:start position:0%
to commit voter fraud might use a fake
 
05:27:13.830 --> 05:27:13.840 align:start position:0%
ID anyway rather it would disenfranchise
 
05:27:16.830 --> 05:27:16.840 align:start position:0%
your hardworking community members if
 
05:27:18.868 --> 05:27:18.878 align:start position:0%
the sole purpose of providing photo ID
 
05:27:21.230 --> 05:27:21.240 align:start position:0%
at voter checkin is to verify identity
 
05:27:22.868 --> 05:27:22.878 align:start position:0%
it is difficult to understand why the
 
05:27:24.670 --> 05:27:24.680 align:start position:0%
approval of a trusted election worker
 
05:27:25.868 --> 05:27:25.878 align:start position:0%
would not
 
05:27:28.310 --> 05:27:28.320 align:start position:0%
suffice continually Pro poking and
 
05:27:30.150 --> 05:27:30.160 align:start position:0%
prodding at the wellestablished and
 
05:27:32.310 --> 05:27:32.320 align:start position:0%
efficient election processes is not
 
05:27:33.628 --> 05:27:33.638 align:start position:0%
going to work to convince Granite
 
05:27:36.070 --> 05:27:36.080 align:start position:0%
Staters elections are safe and secure
 
05:27:37.590 --> 05:27:37.600 align:start position:0%
rather the growing perception of
 
05:27:39.510 --> 05:27:39.520 align:start position:0%
constant unfounded change will lead to
 
05:27:41.070 --> 05:27:41.080 align:start position:0%
the loss of confidence in the state's
 
05:27:43.390 --> 05:27:43.400 align:start position:0%
electoral processes and breach vital
 
05:27:44.868 --> 05:27:44.878 align:start position:0%
trust between the state and election
 
05:27:47.310 --> 05:27:47.320 align:start position:0%
workers for these reasons I respectfully
 
05:27:50.150 --> 05:27:50.160 align:start position:0%
urge you to vote HB 317 and expedian to
 
05:27:51.788 --> 05:27:51.798 align:start position:0%
legislate and I'm open to questions if
 
05:27:53.190 --> 05:27:53.200 align:start position:0%

well as fellow
 
05:29:13.750 --> 05:29:13.760 align:start position:0%
moderator what do you think
 
05:29:17.548 --> 05:29:17.558 align:start position:0%
the goal of this bill is if it isn't to
 
05:29:20.470 --> 05:29:20.480 align:start position:0%
prevent somebody from registering to
 
05:29:23.270 --> 05:29:23.280 align:start position:0%
vote I don't think this is to register I
 
05:29:25.270 --> 05:29:25.280 align:start position:0%
think this is to be on the checklist
 
05:29:26.350 --> 05:29:26.360 align:start position:0%
yeah but they're talking to the
 
05:29:27.750 --> 05:29:27.760 align:start position:0%
supervisor of the
 
05:29:30.030 --> 05:29:30.040 align:start position:0%
checklist they their job they're not
 
05:29:31.390 --> 05:29:31.400 align:start position:0%
going to see the supervisor of the
 
05:29:33.230 --> 05:29:33.240 align:start position:0%
checklist I don't mean to get into a
 
05:29:35.270 --> 05:29:35.280 align:start position:0%
discussion but I'm trying to work this
 
05:29:36.510 --> 05:29:36.520 align:start position:0%
out that's okay it's the last one of the
 
05:29:38.390 --> 05:29:38.400 align:start position:0%
day we'll let St fly they're not going
 
05:29:40.350 --> 05:29:40.360 align:start position:0%
to be seeing the supervisor checklist
 
05:29:43.350 --> 05:29:43.360 align:start position:0%
unless they're registering to vote right
 
05:29:45.788 --> 05:29:45.798 align:start position:0%
they would have no reason to be there as
 
05:29:49.150 --> 05:29:49.160 align:start position:0%

05:29:52.030 --> 05:29:52.040 align:start position:0%
of whatever combined um yeah I don't
 
05:29:53.590 --> 05:29:53.600 align:start position:0%
know I'm just trying to find to figure
 
05:29:55.830 --> 05:29:55.840 align:start position:0%
out what the supervisor of the checklist
 
05:29:59.390 --> 05:29:59.400 align:start position:0%
are not allowed or not permitted to sit
 
05:29:59.400 --> 05:30:00.430 align:start position:0%
are not allowed or not permitted to sit
as

05:30:00.430 --> 05:30:00.440 align:start position:0%
as
 
05:30:03.190 --> 05:30:03.200 align:start position:0%
checkin they are allowed they sit at the
 
05:30:05.430 --> 05:30:05.440 align:start position:0%
table that have the new registrant
 
05:30:06.990 --> 05:30:07.000 align:start position:0%
they're outside the polling place they
 
05:30:08.788 --> 05:30:08.798 align:start position:0%
have to be outside the polling
 
05:30:11.390 --> 05:30:11.400 align:start position:0%
place I just think the outside the guard
 
05:30:13.110 --> 05:30:13.120 align:start position:0%
rail is what you mean right yeah not the
 
05:30:15.708 --> 05:30:15.718 align:start position:0%
outside the polling place thank you
 
05:30:15.718 --> 05:30:16.708 align:start position:0%
outside the polling place thank you

Mr chair thank you for taking my
 
05:30:27.310 --> 05:30:27.320 align:start position:0%
question in your experience of for each
 
05:30:30.750 --> 05:30:30.760 align:start position:0%
election how many of this type of Voters
 
05:30:34.070 --> 05:30:34.080 align:start position:0%
uh come to your uh polling
 
05:30:38.548 --> 05:30:38.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:42.150 --> 05:30:42.160 align:start position:0%
I would say in the past 30 years or so
 
05:30:44.110 --> 05:30:44.120 align:start position:0%
well it's only been a few years that
 
05:30:46.070 --> 05:30:46.080 align:start position:0%
you've had to identify
 
05:30:49.150 --> 05:30:49.160 align:start position:0%
yourself probably one each election the
 
05:30:52.310 --> 05:30:52.320 align:start position:0%
major elections the cities and towns of
 
05:30:55.708 --> 05:30:55.718 align:start position:0%
the 2600 voters I have I probably get
 
05:31:00.030 --> 05:31:00.040 align:start position:0%
300 last general election I had
 
05:31:02.750 --> 05:31:02.760 align:start position:0%
2,36 one person came with that ID and we
 
05:31:04.430 --> 05:31:04.440 align:start position:0%
could not identify the per no one in the
 
05:31:06.390 --> 05:31:06.400 align:start position:0%
room could identify the person may I
 
05:31:08.548 --> 05:31:08.558 align:start position:0%
follow up yeah
 
05:31:11.628 --> 05:31:11.638 align:start position:0%
so in any of those elections were there
 
05:31:15.788 --> 05:31:15.798 align:start position:0%

05:31:21.990 --> 05:31:22.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:24.310 --> 05:31:24.320 align:start position:0%
deficiency well we'll see I got news for
 
05:31:25.470 --> 05:31:25.480 align:start position:0%
you let me tell you what happens when
 
05:31:27.190 --> 05:31:27.200 align:start position:0%
you make that
 
05:31:30.110 --> 05:31:30.120 align:start position:0%
promise representative Lane this isn't a
 
05:31:33.350 --> 05:31:33.360 align:start position:0%
question but as I indicated before U
 
05:31:36.270 --> 05:31:36.280 align:start position:0%
Miss Barnes is the moderator at my ward
 
05:31:39.830 --> 05:31:39.840 align:start position:0%
and I'm telling you she runs a tight
 
05:31:44.310 --> 05:31:44.320 align:start position:0%
sh okay um any further questions I have
 
05:31:48.390 --> 05:31:48.400 align:start position:0%
some so um is Hartwood Lane in your
 
05:31:51.590 --> 05:31:51.600 align:start position:0%
board I have 2600 voters but I do
 
05:31:54.510 --> 05:31:54.520 align:start position:0%
remember yes okay all right so it's an
 
05:31:56.750 --> 05:31:56.760 align:start position:0%
apartment complex so how would someone
 
05:31:58.270 --> 05:31:58.280 align:start position:0%
be expected to know everybody coming in
 
05:31:59.628 --> 05:31:59.638 align:start position:0%
and out of that how could they possibly
 
05:32:03.230 --> 05:32:03.240 align:start position:0%
do that war two and conquered has during
 
05:32:05.270 --> 05:32:05.280 align:start position:0%
the redistricting I lost most of the
 
05:32:09.030 --> 05:32:09.040 align:start position:0%
houses I have trailer parks Condominiums
 
05:32:12.310 --> 05:32:12.320 align:start position:0%
and apartments yeah so last election I
 
05:32:14.430 --> 05:32:14.440 align:start position:0%
had 342 new
 
05:32:17.670 --> 05:32:17.680 align:start position:0%
voters so um follow if you may so these
 
05:32:19.150 --> 05:32:19.160 align:start position:0%
when you have that more densely packed
 
05:32:20.590 --> 05:32:20.600 align:start position:0%
areas and you move to apartments and
 
05:32:22.628 --> 05:32:22.638 align:start position:0%
condos forms of housing that tend to be
 
05:32:22.638 --> 05:32:23.590 align:start position:0%
condos forms of housing that tend to be
more

05:32:23.590 --> 05:32:23.600 align:start position:0%
more
 
05:32:25.708 --> 05:32:25.718 align:start position:0%
transient you have more people coming
 
05:32:28.390 --> 05:32:28.400 align:start position:0%
through that your team you and your team
 
05:32:30.470 --> 05:32:30.480 align:start position:0%
can't know just by virtue of you said
 
05:32:32.310 --> 05:32:32.320 align:start position:0%
you have 314 so there's that's a lot of
 
05:32:34.350 --> 05:32:34.360 align:start position:0%
new faces to possibly know so if those
 
05:32:37.270 --> 05:32:37.280 align:start position:0%
314 people none of them showed ID what
 
05:32:38.788 --> 05:32:38.798 align:start position:0%
