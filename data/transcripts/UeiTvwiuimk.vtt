01:00:24.150 --> 01:00:24.160 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman so this amendment
 
01:00:28.069 --> 01:00:28.079 align:start position:0%
for uh Senate Bill 510 adds on um House
 
01:00:31.029 --> 01:00:31.039 align:start position:0%
Bill 1391 which is the um inspection
 
01:00:33.150 --> 01:00:33.160 align:start position:0%
Bill about having new vehicles inspected
 
01:00:35.670 --> 01:00:35.680 align:start position:0%
every other year um so we've already
 
01:00:37.029 --> 01:00:37.039 align:start position:0%
talked about that a lot so I don't think
 
01:00:38.430 --> 01:00:38.440 align:start position:0%
I need to go into that anymore and it
 
01:00:42.670 --> 01:00:42.680 align:start position:0%
also adds on um House Bill 16 um was it
 
01:00:46.829 --> 01:00:46.839 align:start position:0%
1638 which uh basically just some um it
 
01:00:49.470 --> 01:00:49.480 align:start position:0%
it's some reforms to the inspection um
 
01:00:51.589 --> 01:00:51.599 align:start position:0%
process and both of these I think we
 
01:00:55.150 --> 01:00:55.160 align:start position:0%
unanimous unanimously uh brought up 1638
 
01:00:56.589 --> 01:00:56.599 align:start position:0%
and it went on consent
 
01:00:58.750 --> 01:00:58.760 align:start position:0%
and um so you know we've already looked
 
01:01:01.150 --> 01:01:01.160 align:start position:0%
at the policy on this and adding um
 
01:01:03.789 --> 01:01:03.799 align:start position:0%
these two bills to to 510 you know 510
 
01:01:05.029 --> 01:01:05.039 align:start position:0%
is going to be good for the automotive
 
01:01:06.630 --> 01:01:06.640 align:start position:0%
industry and adding these two inspection
 
01:01:07.710 --> 01:01:07.720 align:start position:0%
bills to it it's going to be good for
 
01:01:09.470 --> 01:01:09.480 align:start position:0%
the consumers so I think everybody
 
01:01:11.430 --> 01:01:11.440 align:start position:0%
wins thank you for that and for the
 
01:01:12.630 --> 01:01:12.640 align:start position:0%
record at a
 
01:01:14.589 --> 01:01:14.599 align:start position:0%
1637 if you are correct that did come
 
01:01:16.470 --> 01:01:16.480 align:start position:0%
out of this committee unanimous we were
 
01:01:19.190 --> 01:01:19.200 align:start position:0%
split on the first year exemption 1291
 
01:01:21.270 --> 01:01:21.280 align:start position:0%
but they are both house positions
 
01:01:23.190 --> 01:01:23.200 align:start position:0%
anybody else for from the committee on
 
01:01:26.150 --> 01:01:26.160 align:start position:0%

01:01:32.029 --> 01:01:32.039 align:start position:0%
said every other year you mean not the
 
01:01:33.470 --> 01:01:33.480 align:start position:0%
first year you don't need to have an
 
01:01:35.270 --> 01:01:35.280 align:start position:0%
inspection for the first year of a new
 
01:01:37.870 --> 01:01:37.880 align:start position:0%
vehicle correct yes sorry first
 
01:01:39.950 --> 01:01:39.960 align:start position:0%
year yeah and the house rules dictate
 
01:01:41.349 --> 01:01:41.359 align:start position:0%
how we do this the language in the
 
01:01:43.630 --> 01:01:43.640 align:start position:0%
amendment is identical to what was
 
01:01:45.549 --> 01:01:45.559 align:start position:0%

01:01:47.990 --> 01:01:48.000 align:start position:0%

zero no so our our amendment is adopted
 
01:02:48.829 --> 01:02:48.839 align:start position:0%
so so now the motion on the floor is
 
01:02:51.870 --> 01:02:51.880 align:start position:0%
ought to pass as amended on Senate Bill
 
01:02:54.430 --> 01:02:54.440 align:start position:0%
510 any thoughts or comments from
 
01:02:57.150 --> 01:02:57.160 align:start position:0%
anybody on the committee up
 
01:03:00.510 --> 01:03:00.520 align:start position:0%
SES so as you all just witnessed I did
 
01:03:02.349 --> 01:03:02.359 align:start position:0%
vote for the amendment because it has
 
01:03:05.230 --> 01:03:05.240 align:start position:0%
some parts that we worked really hard on
 
01:03:08.430 --> 01:03:08.440 align:start position:0%
um that I'm happy to see go back in
 
01:03:11.230 --> 01:03:11.240 align:start position:0%
which is the the second part of the
 
01:03:15.150 --> 01:03:15.160 align:start position:0%
amendment which deals with some of the
 
01:03:18.670 --> 01:03:18.680 align:start position:0%
obvious disconnects between uh our
 
01:03:21.349 --> 01:03:21.359 align:start position:0%
citizens and what they experience at the
 
01:03:23.990 --> 01:03:24.000 align:start position:0%
the dealers and like for instance
 
01:03:26.789 --> 01:03:26.799 align:start position:0%
cracked uh
 
01:03:29.549 --> 01:03:29.559 align:start position:0%
uh red light uh back backup lights and
 
01:03:32.910 --> 01:03:32.920 align:start position:0%
so on um so I I'm very much in favor of
 
01:03:34.789 --> 01:03:34.799 align:start position:0%
that and that was why I voted for the
 
01:03:39.390 --> 01:03:39.400 align:start position:0%
amendment however I am opposed to the
 
01:03:44.069 --> 01:03:44.079 align:start position:0%
one-year uh inspections by uh allowing
 
01:03:46.190 --> 01:03:46.200 align:start position:0%
new vehicles to not be inspected by the
 
01:03:48.430 --> 01:03:48.440 align:start position:0%
first year I have a lot of serious
 
01:03:51.349 --> 01:03:51.359 align:start position:0%
concerns about that um I know that we
 
01:03:51.359 --> 01:03:52.150 align:start position:0%
concerns about that um I know that we
will

01:03:52.150 --> 01:03:52.160 align:start position:0%
will
 
01:03:56.069 --> 01:03:56.079 align:start position:0%
hear uh while that there's no connection
 
01:04:02.430 --> 01:04:02.440 align:start position:0%
between inspections and uh crashes well
 
01:04:05.829 --> 01:04:05.839 align:start position:0%
it's the data is incomplete there's no
 
01:04:08.230 --> 01:04:08.240 align:start position:0%
actual real data it's trying to prove a
 
01:04:10.549 --> 01:04:10.559 align:start position:0%
negative which I think is really
 
01:04:14.390 --> 01:04:14.400 align:start position:0%
Impossible on top of that many vehicles
 
01:04:16.470 --> 01:04:16.480 align:start position:0%
fail inspection
 
01:04:19.750 --> 01:04:19.760 align:start position:0%
initially but then the dealer offers to
 
01:04:23.510 --> 01:04:23.520 align:start position:0%
fix the the slight problem and pass the
 
01:04:25.950 --> 01:04:25.960 align:start position:0%
vehicle that happened to my own personal
 
01:04:29.390 --> 01:04:29.400 align:start position:0%
vehicle just two days ago brought it to
 
01:04:31.549 --> 01:04:31.559 align:start position:0%
the garage to have a recall done they
 
01:04:33.430 --> 01:04:33.440 align:start position:0%
said we can do your inspections at the
 
01:04:35.349 --> 01:04:35.359 align:start position:0%
same time they found a minor problem
 
01:04:36.870 --> 01:04:36.880 align:start position:0%
that would cause it to fail but they
 
01:04:40.109 --> 01:04:40.119 align:start position:0%
fixed it and my vehicle passed
 
01:04:43.589 --> 01:04:43.599 align:start position:0%
inspection so I know this to be um very
 
01:04:47.630 --> 01:04:47.640 align:start position:0%
much something that happens so I
 
01:04:51.470 --> 01:04:51.480 align:start position:0%
understand that we are trying to find
 
01:04:54.109 --> 01:04:54.119 align:start position:0%
um ways to make it better for the
 
01:04:56.510 --> 01:04:56.520 align:start position:0%
motoring public I do not feel that the
 
01:04:58.549 --> 01:04:58.559 align:start position:0%
second the first half of the amendment
 
01:05:00.829 --> 01:05:00.839 align:start position:0%
does that and in fact in my mind it
 
01:05:03.349 --> 01:05:03.359 align:start position:0%
makes people less safe and is a bad
 
01:05:07.430 --> 01:05:07.440 align:start position:0%
Public Safety uh position to take
 
01:05:09.870 --> 01:05:09.880 align:start position:0%
consequently I'd be voting against the
 
01:05:12.309 --> 01:05:12.319 align:start position:0%
uh a motion of ought to pass as
 
01:05:15.910 --> 01:05:15.920 align:start position:0%
amended thank you anybody
 
01:05:15.920 --> 01:05:17.710 align:start position:0%
amended thank you anybody
else

01:05:17.710 --> 01:05:17.720 align:start position:0%
else
 
01:05:20.990 --> 01:05:21.000 align:start position:0%
nobody well I representative Coker thank
 
01:05:23.230 --> 01:05:23.240 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman so I'd like to you know
 
01:05:24.829 --> 01:05:24.839 align:start position:0%
kind of an observation I have when the
 
01:05:28.190 --> 01:05:28.200 align:start position:0%
data is hard to get and it it doesn't
 
01:05:30.710 --> 01:05:30.720 align:start position:0%
push in One Direction or the other It
 
01:05:32.109 --> 01:05:32.119 align:start position:0%
generally means that there's just not
 
01:05:34.789 --> 01:05:34.799 align:start position:0%
much data it's not really having an
 
01:05:37.630 --> 01:05:37.640 align:start position:0%
effect so again like it's it's you know
 
01:05:40.829 --> 01:05:40.839 align:start position:0%
if if if vehicle inspections actually
 
01:05:42.750 --> 01:05:42.760 align:start position:0%
correlated with safety and outcomes on
 
01:05:44.190 --> 01:05:44.200 align:start position:0%
the roadways the data would show that
 
01:05:46.870 --> 01:05:46.880 align:start position:0%
very easily and the fact that it doesn't
 
01:05:48.789 --> 01:05:48.799 align:start position:0%
I think uh proves the point that we can
 
01:05:51.750 --> 01:05:51.760 align:start position:0%
make this change to new vehicle safely
 
01:05:53.390 --> 01:05:53.400 align:start position:0%
without having an effect on our roadways
 
01:05:53.400 --> 01:05:54.069 align:start position:0%
without having an effect on our roadways
thank

01:05:54.069 --> 01:05:54.079 align:start position:0%
thank
 
01:05:57.029 --> 01:05:57.039 align:start position:0%
you anybody else
 
01:05:58.430 --> 01:05:58.440 align:start position:0%
I'll just add one more thing I've been
 
01:06:00.630 --> 01:06:00.640 align:start position:0%
defending this program my whole time in
 
01:06:03.349 --> 01:06:03.359 align:start position:0%
this house sitting on this committee um
 
01:06:04.990 --> 01:06:05.000 align:start position:0%
but for the last half a dozen years
 
01:06:07.069 --> 01:06:07.079 align:start position:0%
we've also been looking at the program
 
01:06:09.029 --> 01:06:09.039 align:start position:0%
admitting uh that there's probably ways
 
01:06:10.789 --> 01:06:10.799 align:start position:0%
to make it better and what we have in
 
01:06:12.309 --> 01:06:12.319 align:start position:0%
the amendment are two common sense
 
01:06:14.950 --> 01:06:14.960 align:start position:0%
things that I think deserve some
 
01:06:18.309 --> 01:06:18.319 align:start position:0%
consideration um I think they belong on
 
01:06:21.950 --> 01:06:21.960 align:start position:0%
a bill as representative Coker said um a
 
01:06:24.230 --> 01:06:24.240 align:start position:0%
bill that actually helps the dealers and
 
01:06:26.589 --> 01:06:26.599 align:start position:0%
our Amendment helps our CI
 
01:06:29.190 --> 01:06:29.200 align:start position:0%
uh I will be supporting this gladly if
 
01:06:31.069 --> 01:06:31.079 align:start position:0%
nobody else wishes to speak I'll ask the
 
01:06:32.430 --> 01:06:32.440 align:start position:0%

I would like to move uh interim study on
 
01:08:32.640 --> 01:08:34.789 align:start position:0%
I would like to move uh interim study on
HB

01:08:34.789 --> 01:08:34.799 align:start position:0%
HB
 
01:08:37.950 --> 01:08:37.960 align:start position:0%
581 uh interm study has been moved by
 
01:08:39.990 --> 01:08:40.000 align:start position:0%
representative a seconded by
 
01:08:41.789 --> 01:08:41.799 align:start position:0%
representative Hill care to speak to
 
01:08:45.910 --> 01:08:45.920 align:start position:0%
your motion sir yes thank you um it was
 
01:08:48.870 --> 01:08:48.880 align:start position:0%
pointed out to us earlier today that uh
 
01:08:50.590 --> 01:08:50.600 align:start position:0%
one some wording in the bill might
 
01:08:53.990 --> 01:08:54.000 align:start position:0%
invalidate the use of a temporary use of
 
01:08:56.550 --> 01:08:56.560 align:start position:0%
a uh expired driver's license as a
 
01:08:58.709 --> 01:08:58.719 align:start position:0%
temporary ID uh while you're waiting for
 
01:09:01.789 --> 01:09:01.799 align:start position:0%
your your full ID to arrive and uh for
 
01:09:03.550 --> 01:09:03.560 align:start position:0%
that reason that we don't have time to
 
01:09:05.630 --> 01:09:05.640 align:start position:0%
really deal with making any changes at
 
01:09:08.110 --> 01:09:08.120 align:start position:0%
this point so just makes sense to
 
01:09:09.910 --> 01:09:09.920 align:start position:0%
interim study it for
 
01:09:13.149 --> 01:09:13.159 align:start position:0%
now anybody
 
01:09:16.229 --> 01:09:16.239 align:start position:0%
else no I Concur and it's uh something
 
01:09:18.110 --> 01:09:18.120 align:start position:0%
we discovered in communication with the
 
01:09:20.309 --> 01:09:20.319 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State's office that the
 
01:09:22.709 --> 01:09:22.719 align:start position:0%
currently the way it is written uh it
 
01:09:26.149 --> 01:09:26.159 align:start position:0%
does contradict current law on uh the
 
01:09:28.829 --> 01:09:28.839 align:start position:0%
use for identification purposes of an
 
01:09:32.990 --> 01:09:33.000 align:start position:0%
expired license so um that and coupled
 
01:09:34.390 --> 01:09:34.400 align:start position:0%
with the fact that it's a housekeeping
 
01:09:36.309 --> 01:09:36.319 align:start position:0%
Bill the planet will probably continue
 
01:09:38.910 --> 01:09:38.920 align:start position:0%
to spin with this going to interim study
 
01:09:40.390 --> 01:09:40.400 align:start position:0%
so that's what I'll be supporting as
 
01:09:43.229 --> 01:09:43.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:45.630 --> 01:09:45.640 align:start position:0%
you seeing nobody else I'll ask the
 
01:09:47.229 --> 01:09:47.239 align:start position:0%
clerk to call the RO when she's ready
 
01:09:48.870 --> 01:09:48.880 align:start position:0%

01:12:11.470 --> 01:12:11.480 align:start position:0%
SP 501 motions in expedient to legislate
 
01:12:14.510 --> 01:12:14.520 align:start position:0%
is there a second second second by
 
01:12:16.270 --> 01:12:16.280 align:start position:0%
represent Dain care to speak to your
 
01:12:18.229 --> 01:12:18.239 align:start position:0%
motion sir I do thank you very much Mr
 
01:12:19.790 --> 01:12:19.800 align:start position:0%
chairman there are three main reasons
 
01:12:22.669 --> 01:12:22.679 align:start position:0%
this bill um I cannot support number one
 
01:12:24.070 --> 01:12:24.080 align:start position:0%
one of the things it does in the very
 
01:12:25.750 --> 01:12:25.760 align:start position:0%
beginning is just grant changes
 
01:12:28.030 --> 01:12:28.040 align:start position:0%
non-resident alien to non-citizen just
 
01:12:31.030 --> 01:12:31.040 align:start position:0%
right off the bat um without any vetting
 
01:12:32.430 --> 01:12:32.440 align:start position:0%
or anything like that and I have a
 
01:12:35.629 --> 01:12:35.639 align:start position:0%
concern with that secondly it it talks
 
01:12:37.830 --> 01:12:37.840 align:start position:0%
about granting cons uh conditional
 
01:12:39.790 --> 01:12:39.800 align:start position:0%
residence but we never got a definition
 
01:12:41.030 --> 01:12:41.040 align:start position:0%
of what that
 
01:12:43.990 --> 01:12:44.000 align:start position:0%
means um and thirdly and probably most
 
01:12:46.070 --> 01:12:46.080 align:start position:0%
importantly uh one of the lines in the
 
01:12:49.550 --> 01:12:49.560 align:start position:0%
bill uh really concerns me where it says
 
01:12:51.430 --> 01:12:51.440 align:start position:0%
once licensed the individual shall be
 
01:12:53.070 --> 01:12:53.080 align:start position:0%
subject to the same provisions of the
 
01:12:55.870 --> 01:12:55.880 align:start position:0%
law of as all other
 
01:12:58.229 --> 01:12:58.239 align:start position:0%
licenses the provision of same
 
01:13:01.550 --> 01:13:01.560 align:start position:0%
provisions of the law this to me means
 
01:13:05.669 --> 01:13:05.679 align:start position:0%
that uh a person can use this for voting
 
01:13:08.470 --> 01:13:08.480 align:start position:0%
and um from election Integrity issue it
 
01:13:10.990 --> 01:13:11.000 align:start position:0%
really concerns me and as a result of
 
01:13:15.149 --> 01:13:15.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:18.629 --> 01:13:18.639 align:start position:0%
bill anybody else from the
 
01:13:18.639 --> 01:13:21.070 align:start position:0%
bill anybody else from the
committee

01:13:21.070 --> 01:13:21.080 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:13:25.189 --> 01:13:25.199 align:start position:0%
representes so I'll be um opposed to to
 
01:13:29.830 --> 01:13:29.840 align:start position:0%
the itl motion um the bill is a came
 
01:13:31.750 --> 01:13:31.760 align:start position:0%
about as a result of the request from
 
01:13:33.590 --> 01:13:33.600 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Division of Motor
 
01:13:36.390 --> 01:13:36.400 align:start position:0%
Vehicles and it frankly mirrors current
 
01:13:38.149 --> 01:13:38.159 align:start position:0%
language and practice it's trying to
 
01:13:39.470 --> 01:13:39.480 align:start position:0%
bring the law
 
01:13:39.480 --> 01:13:41.550 align:start position:0%
bring the law
into

01:13:41.550 --> 01:13:41.560 align:start position:0%
into
 
01:13:41.560 --> 01:13:43.189 align:start position:0%
into
um

01:13:43.189 --> 01:13:43.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:13:46.870 --> 01:13:46.880 align:start position:0%
conformance um we have 55,000 people
 
01:13:49.310 --> 01:13:49.320 align:start position:0%
driving who are
 
01:13:53.070 --> 01:13:53.080 align:start position:0%
non citizen residents of New Hampshire
 
01:13:56.270 --> 01:13:56.280 align:start position:0%
in this state with no no known
 
01:13:59.870 --> 01:13:59.880 align:start position:0%
documented uh voting problems uh for
 
01:14:04.629 --> 01:14:04.639 align:start position:0%
those folks um uh we had more people
 
01:14:06.470 --> 01:14:06.480 align:start position:0%
speak in favor of the bill than we did
 
01:14:08.310 --> 01:14:08.320 align:start position:0%
against it and for those reasons and
 
01:14:11.189 --> 01:14:11.199 align:start position:0%
many more I will be uh opposed to the
 
01:14:15.669 --> 01:14:15.679 align:start position:0%
itl motion so that another motion can be
 
01:14:18.870 --> 01:14:18.880 align:start position:0%
introduced anybody else from the
 
01:14:22.669 --> 01:14:22.679 align:start position:0%
committee well seeing none I guess I'll
 
01:14:24.350 --> 01:14:24.360 align:start position:0%
just mention a couple of things first
 
01:14:25.750 --> 01:14:25.760 align:start position:0%
I'll start off
 
01:14:27.430 --> 01:14:27.440 align:start position:0%
um just to get this out of the way it's
 
01:14:28.629 --> 01:14:28.639 align:start position:0%
been brought to my attention by the
 
01:14:30.070 --> 01:14:30.080 align:start position:0%
department uh the director of Motor
 
01:14:31.709 --> 01:14:31.719 align:start position:0%
Vehicles that I may have spoken
 
01:14:34.390 --> 01:14:34.400 align:start position:0%
inaccurately at our last Hearing in his
 
01:14:38.189 --> 01:14:38.199 align:start position:0%
absence uh in reviewing the video which
 
01:14:40.030 --> 01:14:40.040 align:start position:0%
for the first time I can say I really
 
01:14:42.910 --> 01:14:42.920 align:start position:0%
appreciate having him now um I may have
 
01:14:45.910 --> 01:14:45.920 align:start position:0%
been a little bit presumptive in one of
 
01:14:47.430 --> 01:14:47.440 align:start position:0%
the things that I mentioned and that was
 
01:14:49.070 --> 01:14:49.080 align:start position:0%
that he told me that everybody coming
 
01:14:52.350 --> 01:14:52.360 align:start position:0%
over through a port adventury received
 
01:14:55.310 --> 01:14:55.320 align:start position:0%
uh lawful presents um that that's
 
01:14:56.750 --> 01:14:56.760 align:start position:0%
probably stronger than what he did tell
 
01:14:58.550 --> 01:14:58.560 align:start position:0%
me what he did mention in a meeting over
 
01:15:02.110 --> 01:15:02.120 align:start position:0%
at the on Hazen Drive is was an example
 
01:15:04.030 --> 01:15:04.040 align:start position:0%
of somebody coming across the border
 
01:15:05.870 --> 01:15:05.880 align:start position:0%
through a Port of Entry who was given a
 
01:15:07.950 --> 01:15:07.960 align:start position:0%
receipt with lawful presence I don't
 
01:15:10.310 --> 01:15:10.320 align:start position:0%
want anybody to think that that was a
 
01:15:12.350 --> 01:15:12.360 align:start position:0%
statement by him saying that it was
 
01:15:14.070 --> 01:15:14.080 align:start position:0%
everybody because that may not be
 
01:15:16.950 --> 01:15:16.960 align:start position:0%
accurate since then I'm led to believe
 
01:15:18.870 --> 01:15:18.880 align:start position:0%
with other sources that is the case but
 
01:15:20.430 --> 01:15:20.440 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to get that out I don't
 
01:15:22.350 --> 01:15:22.360 align:start position:0%
want to say things that he said that may
 
01:15:25.070 --> 01:15:25.080 align:start position:0%
not be completely accurate uh but I will
 
01:15:28.229 --> 01:15:28.239 align:start position:0%
be voting against this as well um for a
 
01:15:30.350 --> 01:15:30.360 align:start position:0%
couple of different reasons we one of
 
01:15:32.510 --> 01:15:32.520 align:start position:0%
them uh one thing that was accurate by
 
01:15:35.189 --> 01:15:35.199 align:start position:0%
me reviewing the video was I was told
 
01:15:37.070 --> 01:15:37.080 align:start position:0%
over and over that we're not giving any
 
01:15:39.350 --> 01:15:39.360 align:start position:0%
licenses to people with pending
 
01:15:42.270 --> 01:15:42.280 align:start position:0%
Asylum uh hearings or in other words no
 
01:15:44.070 --> 01:15:44.080 align:start position:0%
pending cases will be given an
 
01:15:45.990 --> 01:15:46.000 align:start position:0%
authorization a
 
01:15:50.669 --> 01:15:50.679 align:start position:0%
license then we were told that um if
 
01:15:52.950 --> 01:15:52.960 align:start position:0%
they do have an employment authorization
 
01:15:54.390 --> 01:15:54.400 align:start position:0%
document or a temporary work
 
01:15:54.400 --> 01:15:55.709 align:start position:0%
document or a temporary work
authorization

01:15:55.709 --> 01:15:55.719 align:start position:0%
authorization
 
01:15:57.229 --> 01:15:57.239 align:start position:0%
that does come with the social security
 
01:15:59.110 --> 01:15:59.120 align:start position:0%
number and therefore they can get a
 
01:16:01.310 --> 01:16:01.320 align:start position:0%
license however their their P their case
 
01:16:04.990 --> 01:16:05.000 align:start position:0%
is still pending um this bill would
 
01:16:08.110 --> 01:16:08.120 align:start position:0%
would grant that um let me see here what
 
01:16:10.950 --> 01:16:10.960 align:start position:0%
else do I want to uh the other thing too
 
01:16:15.310 --> 01:16:15.320 align:start position:0%
this also changes a definition um from
 
01:16:17.149 --> 01:16:17.159 align:start position:0%
uh where is
 
01:16:19.750 --> 01:16:19.760 align:start position:0%
it non-resident alien which is still a
 
01:16:24.590 --> 01:16:24.600 align:start position:0%
legal term to a non-citizen I don't know
 
01:16:26.070 --> 01:16:26.080 align:start position:0%
if we should be changing our laws
 
01:16:28.310 --> 01:16:28.320 align:start position:0%
outside of what's a legal definition I
 
01:16:29.950 --> 01:16:29.960 align:start position:0%
just don't think it's a good idea I
 
01:16:32.070 --> 01:16:32.080 align:start position:0%
could go on and on on this but I'll be
 
01:16:33.590 --> 01:16:33.600 align:start position:0%
voting no and I encourage everybody on
 
01:16:35.950 --> 01:16:35.960 align:start position:0%
the committee to do so anybody else from
 
01:16:35.960 --> 01:16:36.990 align:start position:0%
the committee to do so anybody else from
the

01:16:36.990 --> 01:16:37.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:16:40.390 --> 01:16:40.400 align:start position:0%
committee representative Hill uh the one
 
01:16:42.070 --> 01:16:42.080 align:start position:0%
the one quick comment that I don't make
 
01:16:45.550 --> 01:16:45.560 align:start position:0%
is um while we're giving licenses for
 
01:16:50.110 --> 01:16:50.120 align:start position:0%
those that are have Asylum uh hearings
 
01:16:53.510 --> 01:16:53.520 align:start position:0%
pending there's never been uh to my
 
01:16:55.510 --> 01:16:55.520 align:start position:0%
understanding an explanation of what
 
01:16:58.629 --> 01:16:58.639 align:start position:0%
happens if that pending application is
 
01:17:01.709 --> 01:17:01.719 align:start position:0%
denied um and we have provided that
 
01:17:05.430 --> 01:17:05.440 align:start position:0%
license so that was one of my concerns
 
01:17:08.149 --> 01:17:08.159 align:start position:0%
and remains to be so I will be
 
01:17:12.990 --> 01:17:13.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:15.350 --> 01:17:15.360 align:start position:0%
motion and we know that the federal
 
01:17:17.310 --> 01:17:17.320 align:start position:0%
government is issuing temporary work
 
01:17:19.070 --> 01:17:19.080 align:start position:0%
authorizations we've seen several bills
 
01:17:20.390 --> 01:17:20.400 align:start position:0%
from this committee over the last few
 
01:17:22.470 --> 01:17:22.480 align:start position:0%
years looking to close the gap if you
 
01:17:24.470 --> 01:17:24.480 align:start position:0%
will because generally speaking it's a
 
01:17:26.030 --> 01:17:26.040 align:start position:0%
year before they get a temporary work
 
01:17:27.790 --> 01:17:27.800 align:start position:0%
authorization if they're here claiming
 
01:17:29.510 --> 01:17:29.520 align:start position:0%
Asylum and we've had the bill that
 
01:17:32.310 --> 01:17:32.320 align:start position:0%
wanted to close that Gap uh up anywhere
 
01:17:35.149 --> 01:17:35.159 align:start position:0%
up until that year um so it is happening
 
01:17:37.310 --> 01:17:37.320 align:start position:0%
uh and unfortunately it's happening in
 
01:17:38.669 --> 01:17:38.679 align:start position:0%
spite of the fact that these people have
 
01:17:40.870 --> 01:17:40.880 align:start position:0%
not been thoroughly vetted and been
 
01:17:42.550 --> 01:17:42.560 align:start position:0%
considered legal to stay in the United
 
01:17:45.149 --> 01:17:45.159 align:start position:0%
States with their claim uh anybody else
 
01:17:46.110 --> 01:17:46.120 align:start position:0%
from the
 
01:17:48.950 --> 01:17:48.960 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none motions itl I'll
 
01:17:50.070 --> 01:17:50.080 align:start position:0%
ask the clerk to call the role when
 
01:17:50.080 --> 01:17:52.030 align:start position:0%
ask the clerk to call the role when
she's

01:17:52.030 --> 01:17:52.040 align:start position:0%

our recommendation
 
01:18:59.950 --> 01:18:59.960 align:start position:0%

01:19:04.350 --> 01:19:04.360 align:start position:0%

care to speak to your motion thank you
 
01:20:03.870 --> 01:20:03.880 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman so uh Senate Bill 358 and it
 
01:20:05.590 --> 01:20:05.600 align:start position:0%
invalidates the out ofate driver's
 
01:20:07.390 --> 01:20:07.400 align:start position:0%
license issued specifically to
 
01:20:10.189 --> 01:20:10.199 align:start position:0%
undocumented immigrants um you know this
 
01:20:13.350 --> 01:20:13.360 align:start position:0%
is a bill that I it's it's it's it's a
 
01:20:16.550 --> 01:20:16.560 align:start position:0%
rough it's a rough topic and the way
 
01:20:19.270 --> 01:20:19.280 align:start position:0%
that I look at this is you know if you
 
01:20:22.110 --> 01:20:22.120 align:start position:0%
go to the Logan Airport there's people
 
01:20:24.870 --> 01:20:24.880 align:start position:0%
there literally living in the terminal
 
01:20:29.229 --> 01:20:29.239 align:start position:0%
running around and those people are here
 
01:20:31.390 --> 01:20:31.400 align:start position:0%
through a legal immigration process from
 
01:20:35.270 --> 01:20:35.280 align:start position:0%
what I understand um and the issue that
 
01:20:39.070 --> 01:20:39.080 align:start position:0%
I have with issuing government IDs to
 
01:20:41.229 --> 01:20:41.239 align:start position:0%
people who are not here legally who are
 
01:20:43.590 --> 01:20:43.600 align:start position:0%
not going through the legal immigration
 
01:20:45.830 --> 01:20:45.840 align:start position:0%
process is by issuing these government
 
01:20:48.590 --> 01:20:48.600 align:start position:0%
IDs in a way you're condoning illegal
 
01:20:48.600 --> 01:20:50.870 align:start position:0%
IDs in a way you're condoning illegal
immigration

01:20:50.870 --> 01:20:50.880 align:start position:0%
immigration
 
01:20:54.669 --> 01:20:54.679 align:start position:0%
and we have a crisis and the last thing
 
01:20:56.550 --> 01:20:56.560 align:start position:0%
in the world you know we're we're having
 
01:20:58.110 --> 01:20:58.120 align:start position:0%
a hard time getting our hands around the
 
01:20:59.950 --> 01:20:59.960 align:start position:0%
legal immigration process the last thing
 
01:21:01.390 --> 01:21:01.400 align:start position:0%
in the world we should be doing right
 
01:21:04.790 --> 01:21:04.800 align:start position:0%
now is to do anything to encourage more
 
01:21:06.550 --> 01:21:06.560 align:start position:0%
illegal immigration because that's only
 
01:21:08.830 --> 01:21:08.840 align:start position:0%
adding to the problems that we have and
 
01:21:11.629 --> 01:21:11.639 align:start position:0%
it's creating a bigger mess that for an
 
01:21:13.629 --> 01:21:13.639 align:start position:0%
issue that's already very very hard to
 
01:21:16.229 --> 01:21:16.239 align:start position:0%
clean up so this isn't about attacking a
 
01:21:17.750 --> 01:21:17.760 align:start position:0%
community this isn't about going after
 
01:21:20.189 --> 01:21:20.199 align:start position:0%
people this is about the rule of law and
 
01:21:23.470 --> 01:21:23.480 align:start position:0%
we have to enforce the laws that we have
 
01:21:25.750 --> 01:21:25.760 align:start position:0%
and I get that there's some Public
 
01:21:30.990 --> 01:21:31.000 align:start position:0%
Safety um Arguments for this bill but in
 
01:21:34.030 --> 01:21:34.040 align:start position:0%
my view we have to to balance that and
 
01:21:37.550 --> 01:21:37.560 align:start position:0%
there's huge Public Safety implications
 
01:21:40.750 --> 01:21:40.760 align:start position:0%
with allowing people to run rough shot
 
01:21:42.830 --> 01:21:42.840 align:start position:0%
over the current laws that we have I
 
01:21:44.110 --> 01:21:44.120 align:start position:0%
mean we have people that have not been
 
01:21:45.750 --> 01:21:45.760 align:start position:0%
vetted that are coming through and then
 
01:21:48.470 --> 01:21:48.480 align:start position:0%
we're issuing IDs to them so this law
 
01:21:50.189 --> 01:21:50.199 align:start position:0%
doesn't allow profiling it doesn't allow
 
01:21:52.870 --> 01:21:52.880 align:start position:0%
anything other than if a license is
 
01:21:55.229 --> 01:21:55.239 align:start position:0%
issued and there's only really a couple
 
01:21:57.030 --> 01:21:57.040 align:start position:0%
states that do this specifically to
 
01:21:58.950 --> 01:21:58.960 align:start position:0%
people who are who cannot prove lawful
 
01:22:01.470 --> 01:22:01.480 align:start position:0%
presence that that Val that license is
 
01:22:03.750 --> 01:22:03.760 align:start position:0%
not valid in our state um that's all it
 
01:22:05.950 --> 01:22:05.960 align:start position:0%
does and it's hard to enforce because a
 
01:22:07.870 --> 01:22:07.880 align:start position:0%
lot of rules are a lot harder to enforce
 
01:22:09.510 --> 01:22:09.520 align:start position:0%
because we have rights and we want to
 
01:22:11.470 --> 01:22:11.480 align:start position:0%
protect those rights and but just
 
01:22:12.950 --> 01:22:12.960 align:start position:0%
because it's hard to enforce doesn't
 
01:22:15.590 --> 01:22:15.600 align:start position:0%
mean it's a bad policy so uh that's why
 
01:22:18.229 --> 01:22:18.239 align:start position:0%
I'm going to be voting yes and um I hope
 
01:22:20.149 --> 01:22:20.159 align:start position:0%
it passes thank
 
01:22:23.030 --> 01:22:23.040 align:start position:0%
you anybody else from the committee
 
01:22:25.750 --> 01:22:25.760 align:start position:0%
representative y
 
01:22:25.760 --> 01:22:31.790 align:start position:0%
representative y

01:25:39.830 --> 01:25:39.840 align:start position:0%
very unusual circumstance we have here
 
01:25:41.350 --> 01:25:41.360 align:start position:0%
we're in the middle of our executive
 
01:25:42.950 --> 01:25:42.960 align:start position:0%

to have a caucus I know probably what
 
01:25:53.550 --> 01:25:53.560 align:start position:0%
it's for and I probably know what the
 
01:25:55.750 --> 01:25:55.760 align:start position:0%
outcome is going to be be but I will do
 
01:25:57.109 --> 01:25:57.119 align:start position:0%
this we have a
 
01:26:00.390 --> 01:26:00.400 align:start position:0%
reputation and and and of doing the
 
01:26:02.149 --> 01:26:02.159 align:start position:0%
right thing and working together in this
 
01:26:03.950 --> 01:26:03.960 align:start position:0%

01:39:39.270 --> 01:39:39.280 align:start position:0%
too nice she recognizes representative
 
01:39:42.149 --> 01:39:42.159 align:start position:0%
SES thank you Mr chairman uh you're not
 
01:39:46.030 --> 01:39:46.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:46.040 --> 01:39:48.030 align:start position:0%
 
view

01:39:48.030 --> 01:39:48.040 align:start position:0%
view
 
01:39:57.750 --> 01:39:57.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:00.350 --> 01:40:00.360 align:start position:0%
uh motion's been to reconsider 501 might
 
01:40:02.470 --> 01:40:02.480 align:start position:0%
made by represent Sykes second I'll
 
01:40:04.189 --> 01:40:04.199 align:start position:0%
speak to my motion representative
 
01:40:07.270 --> 01:40:07.280 align:start position:0%
seconded by representative be uh this is
 
01:40:09.629 --> 01:40:09.639 align:start position:0%
no surprise to me just so you all know
 
01:40:14.189 --> 01:40:14.199 align:start position:0%
uh Mr chairman sure I believe that the
 
01:40:16.589 --> 01:40:16.599 align:start position:0%
pending motion is on Senate Bill
 
01:40:19.669 --> 01:40:19.679 align:start position:0%
358 and the reconsideration motion would
 
01:40:23.109 --> 01:40:23.119 align:start position:0%
only be in order after disposing of 358
 
01:40:25.470 --> 01:40:25.480 align:start position:0%
so so even though well hold on even
 
01:40:29.589 --> 01:40:29.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:29.599 --> 01:40:32.229 align:start position:0%
 
358

01:40:32.229 --> 01:40:32.239 align:start position:0%
358
 
01:40:32.239 --> 01:40:34.030 align:start position:0%
358
yeah

01:40:34.030 --> 01:40:34.040 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:40:36.470 --> 01:40:36.480 align:start position:0%
okay so I'm not saying I'm I'm not
 
01:40:38.229 --> 01:40:38.239 align:start position:0%
saying that you can't take the motion
 
01:40:42.470 --> 01:40:42.480 align:start position:0%
just not at this very moment so okay so
 
01:40:45.430 --> 01:40:45.440 align:start position:0%
I have thank you for that um
 
01:40:47.870 --> 01:40:47.880 align:start position:0%
representative Smith um we did check
 
01:40:50.830 --> 01:40:50.840 align:start position:0%
with the clerk and I'm going to ask the
 
01:40:53.830 --> 01:40:53.840 align:start position:0%
deputy ranking member to read the
 
01:40:56.189 --> 01:40:56.199 align:start position:0%
clerk's response to our question about
 
01:40:59.310 --> 01:40:59.320 align:start position:0%
reconsideration and how that
 
01:41:02.350 --> 01:41:02.360 align:start position:0%
works well I just I thought we would may
 
01:41:04.470 --> 01:41:04.480 align:start position:0%
maybe it will help clarify things maybe
 
01:41:07.589 --> 01:41:07.599 align:start position:0%
maybe it will be that uh we we have to I
 
01:41:10.589 --> 01:41:10.599 align:start position:0%
have to wait a little bit but um if
 
01:41:11.589 --> 01:41:11.599 align:start position:0%
you've got a communication
 
01:41:14.109 --> 01:41:14.119 align:start position:0%
representative Val You by all
 
01:41:16.390 --> 01:41:16.400 align:start position:0%
means I mean because we didn't take this
 
01:41:16.400 --> 01:41:21.669 align:start position:0%
means I mean because we didn't take this
step

01:41:21.669 --> 01:41:21.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:24.109 --> 01:41:24.119 align:start position:0%
lightly he just said we anyone can move
 
01:41:26.070 --> 01:41:26.080 align:start position:0%
to reconsider he didn't address whether
 
01:41:29.669 --> 01:41:29.679 align:start position:0%
we could do it uh while another bill was
 
01:41:31.870 --> 01:41:31.880 align:start position:0%
recessed okay well then I'm going to I'm
 
01:41:33.790 --> 01:41:33.800 align:start position:0%
going to take the advice of the Deputy
 
01:41:35.390 --> 01:41:35.400 align:start position:0%
Speaker of the House in this matter in
 
01:41:38.790 --> 01:41:38.800 align:start position:0%
terms of the priority and and what which
 
01:41:41.430 --> 01:41:41.440 align:start position:0%
where we take things up so that being
 
01:41:43.030 --> 01:41:43.040 align:start position:0%
said GL that you understand where I'm
 
01:41:45.510 --> 01:41:45.520 align:start position:0%
coming from I will reopen the public I
 
01:41:47.109 --> 01:41:47.119 align:start position:0%
mean the executive session on Senate
 
01:41:50.070 --> 01:41:50.080 align:start position:0%
Bill 358 we'll dispose of that and then
 
01:41:53.750 --> 01:41:53.760 align:start position:0%
move on to any other business um
 
01:41:56.790 --> 01:41:56.800 align:start position:0%
so we had somebody speak in favor of the
 
01:42:00.149 --> 01:42:00.159 align:start position:0%
op to pass anybody else wish to speak on
 
01:42:02.149 --> 01:42:02.159 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill
 
01:42:04.390 --> 01:42:04.400 align:start position:0%
358 represent St
 
01:42:07.470 --> 01:42:07.480 align:start position:0%
Clair thank you Mr
 
01:42:11.390 --> 01:42:11.400 align:start position:0%
chair I don't I don't see how this bill
 
01:42:16.550 --> 01:42:16.560 align:start position:0%
has anything to do with people being in
 
01:42:19.310 --> 01:42:19.320 align:start position:0%
this country illegally because these
 
01:42:22.310 --> 01:42:22.320 align:start position:0%
licenses are issued by other states it
 
01:42:23.830 --> 01:42:23.840 align:start position:0%
has nothing to do
 
01:42:27.709 --> 01:42:27.719 align:start position:0%
with anything but that and I can only
 
01:42:30.470 --> 01:42:30.480 align:start position:0%
envision our Public Safety officials on
 
01:42:33.030 --> 01:42:33.040 align:start position:0%
the side of the highway with a vehicle
 
01:42:36.070 --> 01:42:36.080 align:start position:0%
that they've stopped for whatever reason
 
01:42:38.149 --> 01:42:38.159 align:start position:0%
and then being suspicious even though
 
01:42:39.790 --> 01:42:39.800 align:start position:0%
they're not supposed to be suspicious of
 
01:42:42.350 --> 01:42:42.360 align:start position:0%
this person's origin asking for the
 
01:42:45.390 --> 01:42:45.400 align:start position:0%
driver's license we know of the 19
 
01:42:48.390 --> 01:42:48.400 align:start position:0%
states that issue these licenses there
 
01:42:52.070 --> 01:42:52.080 align:start position:0%
are only a few that Mark the licenses
 
01:42:54.669 --> 01:42:54.679 align:start position:0%
belonging to somebody that is a
 
01:42:57.790 --> 01:42:57.800 align:start position:0%
non-resident of the country or non
 
01:43:00.629 --> 01:43:00.639 align:start position:0%
citizen so in their investigation
 
01:43:02.750 --> 01:43:02.760 align:start position:0%
they're going to have to do which would
 
01:43:05.109 --> 01:43:05.119 align:start position:0%
probably be timely since we don't have
 
01:43:07.709 --> 01:43:07.719 align:start position:0%
the records in our in our data
 
01:43:09.870 --> 01:43:09.880 align:start position:0%
system uh they're going to be tied up on
 
01:43:12.109 --> 01:43:12.119 align:start position:0%
the side of the road for maybe as long
 
01:43:14.629 --> 01:43:14.639 align:start position:0%
as 20 30 40 minutes trying to figure
 
01:43:17.629 --> 01:43:17.639 align:start position:0%
this out and they could be doing a lot
 
01:43:20.310 --> 01:43:20.320 align:start position:0%
more good for the citizens of this state
 
01:43:23.589 --> 01:43:23.599 align:start position:0%
uh patrolling our highways for the norm
 
01:43:25.510 --> 01:43:25.520 align:start position:0%
the numerous violations that can happen
 
01:43:27.870 --> 01:43:27.880 align:start position:0%
especially drunk driving or answering
 
01:43:30.830 --> 01:43:30.840 align:start position:0%
other more important calls than to
 
01:43:32.830 --> 01:43:32.840 align:start position:0%
determine if this
 
01:43:35.669 --> 01:43:35.679 align:start position:0%
person doesn't meet somebody's criteria
 
01:43:37.950 --> 01:43:37.960 align:start position:0%
in this state to have the driver's
 
01:43:40.430 --> 01:43:40.440 align:start position:0%
license issued by another state and I
 
01:43:42.830 --> 01:43:42.840 align:start position:0%
can only imagine what the potential of
 
01:43:44.189 --> 01:43:44.199 align:start position:0%
this does I think it's called the
 
01:43:47.870 --> 01:43:47.880 align:start position:0%
interstate commerce pack that all other
 
01:43:51.109 --> 01:43:51.119 align:start position:0%
49 states honor uh with regards to our
 
01:43:54.350 --> 01:43:54.360 align:start position:0%
driver's licenses in this state so
 
01:43:56.470 --> 01:43:56.480 align:start position:0%
that's just one big concern I have and I
 
01:43:58.790 --> 01:43:58.800 align:start position:0%
I hope you all will consider that this
 
01:44:03.470 --> 01:44:03.480 align:start position:0%
is to me nothing but a bizar Bill thank
 
01:44:05.870 --> 01:44:05.880 align:start position:0%
you anybody else from the committee
 
01:44:05.880 --> 01:44:07.030 align:start position:0%
you anybody else from the committee
representative

01:44:07.030 --> 01:44:07.040 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:44:09.589 --> 01:44:09.599 align:start position:0%
a yeah this this bill comes with a lot
 
01:44:12.709 --> 01:44:12.719 align:start position:0%
of questions um about constitutionality
 
01:44:17.189 --> 01:44:17.199 align:start position:0%
and um just how it applies to um the
 
01:44:18.910 --> 01:44:18.920 align:start position:0%
interstate compact do we have the
 
01:44:20.390 --> 01:44:20.400 align:start position:0%
authority under the Full Faith and
 
01:44:21.910 --> 01:44:21.920 align:start position:0%
Credit Clause of the Constitution to
 
01:44:24.830 --> 01:44:24.840 align:start position:0%
invalidate in other states
 
01:44:28.030 --> 01:44:28.040 align:start position:0%
documentation um how does this
 
01:44:29.830 --> 01:44:29.840 align:start position:0%
affect we're essentially creating
 
01:44:31.109 --> 01:44:31.119 align:start position:0%
criminals out of people who have not
 
01:44:33.510 --> 01:44:33.520 align:start position:0%
committed a criminal offense uh they've
 
01:44:34.950 --> 01:44:34.960 align:start position:0%
done everything correctly they've proven
 
01:44:36.109 --> 01:44:36.119 align:start position:0%
that they can drive they've done
 
01:44:37.350 --> 01:44:37.360 align:start position:0%
everything what a driver's license is
 
01:44:39.149 --> 01:44:39.159 align:start position:0%
supposed to do proven that they've been
 
01:44:40.669 --> 01:44:40.679 align:start position:0%
trained and they've been tested and
 
01:44:42.910 --> 01:44:42.920 align:start position:0%
they've been found safe to be on our
 
01:44:45.310 --> 01:44:45.320 align:start position:0%
highways um it means they probably have
 
01:44:46.870 --> 01:44:46.880 align:start position:0%
insurance when otherwise they wouldn't
 
01:44:51.510 --> 01:44:51.520 align:start position:0%
have um how does this affect um the
 
01:44:53.189 --> 01:44:53.199 align:start position:0%
interstate commerce clause how does this
 
01:44:54.990 --> 01:44:55.000 align:start position:0%
affect the the interstate driver's
 
01:44:57.189 --> 01:44:57.199 align:start position:0%
license compact we have so many
 
01:44:58.550 --> 01:44:58.560 align:start position:0%
questions on this I don't know how we
 
01:45:00.430 --> 01:45:00.440 align:start position:0%
can in good
 
01:45:03.629 --> 01:45:03.639 align:start position:0%
confidence in good faith pass this bill
 
01:45:07.149 --> 01:45:07.159 align:start position:0%
um with all these questions and
 
01:45:10.589 --> 01:45:10.599 align:start position:0%
um I guess I'll leave it at that anybody
 
01:45:12.669 --> 01:45:12.679 align:start position:0%
else from the
 
01:45:14.470 --> 01:45:14.480 align:start position:0%
committee we already had a turn
 
01:45:14.480 --> 01:45:15.910 align:start position:0%
committee we already had a turn
representative

01:45:15.910 --> 01:45:15.920 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:45:18.149 --> 01:45:18.159 align:start position:0%
rumo um I would add that there was
 
01:45:20.149 --> 01:45:20.159 align:start position:0%
earlier comment that this bill from
 
01:45:22.030 --> 01:45:22.040 align:start position:0%
represent Koker is about the rule of law
 
01:45:23.750 --> 01:45:23.760 align:start position:0%
and I think that's somewhere we agree
 
01:45:25.390 --> 01:45:25.400 align:start position:0%
just not what that means this is very
 
01:45:27.790 --> 01:45:27.800 align:start position:0%
much about the rule of law this is about
 
01:45:30.229 --> 01:45:30.239 align:start position:0%
respecting each State's laws I think
 
01:45:31.510 --> 01:45:31.520 align:start position:0%
that's something we talk about a lot on
 
01:45:33.189 --> 01:45:33.199 align:start position:0%
the house floor and the expectation that
 
01:45:35.270 --> 01:45:35.280 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's laws will be respected
 
01:45:38.550 --> 01:45:38.560 align:start position:0%
um and so the idea that we would see fit
 
01:45:41.790 --> 01:45:41.800 align:start position:0%
to disregard other states laws and as
 
01:45:43.629 --> 01:45:43.639 align:start position:0%
representative St Clair mentioned run
 
01:45:46.310 --> 01:45:46.320 align:start position:0%
the risk of that being uh sent back at
 
01:45:50.189 --> 01:45:50.199 align:start position:0%
us and reciprocated um is is really
 
01:45:51.950 --> 01:45:51.960 align:start position:0%
surprising to me um and so I would
 
01:45:53.310 --> 01:45:53.320 align:start position:0%
second all the questions that ref pres
 
01:45:57.510 --> 01:45:57.520 align:start position:0%
value raised um I'll leave it that
 
01:45:59.589 --> 01:45:59.599 align:start position:0%
thanks anybody
 
01:46:03.750 --> 01:46:03.760 align:start position:0%
else represent Gorski thank you Mr
 
01:46:07.109 --> 01:46:07.119 align:start position:0%
chairman my big concern we're talking
 
01:46:09.990 --> 01:46:10.000 align:start position:0%
about other states here and we're
 
01:46:13.709 --> 01:46:13.719 align:start position:0%
assuming that they're fully vetting
 
01:46:16.950 --> 01:46:16.960 align:start position:0%
these people that we know what their
 
01:46:20.070 --> 01:46:20.080 align:start position:0%
processes are I I asked a question
 
01:46:23.430 --> 01:46:23.440 align:start position:0%
during the testimony like what are the
 
01:46:25.030 --> 01:46:25.040 align:start position:0%
other states and how are they vetting
 
01:46:27.270 --> 01:46:27.280 align:start position:0%
and we couldn't get an answer to that we
 
01:46:29.830 --> 01:46:29.840 align:start position:0%
have no idea what these other states do
 
01:46:32.510 --> 01:46:32.520 align:start position:0%
how long they vet we've had testimony
 
01:46:34.430 --> 01:46:34.440 align:start position:0%
here in the past that it takes over nine
 
01:46:37.030 --> 01:46:37.040 align:start position:0%
months to do fully vetting we don't know
 
01:46:39.550 --> 01:46:39.560 align:start position:0%
what these other states are doing so for
 
01:46:42.830 --> 01:46:42.840 align:start position:0%
for us to assume that other states are
 
01:46:46.390 --> 01:46:46.400 align:start position:0%
doing proper full vetting and we should
 
01:46:49.030 --> 01:46:49.040 align:start position:0%
be accepting that I think is a huge
 
01:46:51.709 --> 01:46:51.719 align:start position:0%
reach um and I just wanted to throw that
 
01:46:53.870 --> 01:46:53.880 align:start position:0%
out there
 
01:46:56.990 --> 01:46:57.000 align:start position:0%
anybody else point of order um I just
 
01:46:58.629 --> 01:46:58.639 align:start position:0%
heard back from the clerk I asked if we
 
01:47:00.270 --> 01:47:00.280 align:start position:0%
recess the next bill can we move to
 
01:47:02.470 --> 01:47:02.480 align:start position:0%
reconsider before bringing before we
 
01:47:03.950 --> 01:47:03.960 align:start position:0%
bring the recess Bill back up and he
 
01:47:06.470 --> 01:47:06.480 align:start position:0%
said yes so technically we have a
 
01:47:09.109 --> 01:47:09.119 align:start position:0%
pending motion that was made before we
 
01:47:11.070 --> 01:47:11.080 align:start position:0%
took the bill back up that we probably
 
01:47:14.470 --> 01:47:14.480 align:start position:0%
should dispose of before moving into
 
01:47:17.350 --> 01:47:17.360 align:start position:0%
this y that information would have been
 
01:47:20.589 --> 01:47:20.599 align:start position:0%
done I'm not bouncing back and forth um
 
01:47:22.910 --> 01:47:22.920 align:start position:0%
I I am a man of my word I will not
 
01:47:24.830 --> 01:47:24.840 align:start position:0%
sneakily close the executive session
 
01:47:26.149 --> 01:47:26.159 align:start position:0%
after we're done with this and I will
 
01:47:28.950 --> 01:47:28.960 align:start position:0%
give the opportunity for that motion to
 
01:47:31.270 --> 01:47:31.280 align:start position:0%
come back for a couple of reasons I'll
 
01:47:32.790 --> 01:47:32.800 align:start position:0%
explain later but in the meantime we're
 
01:47:34.350 --> 01:47:34.360 align:start position:0%
going to dispose of
 
01:47:36.870 --> 01:47:36.880 align:start position:0%
358 anybody else from the committee on
 
01:47:40.709 --> 01:47:40.719 align:start position:0%
358 represent Smith thank you Mr chair I
 
01:47:43.709 --> 01:47:43.719 align:start position:0%
just want to address this issue of the
 
01:47:46.870 --> 01:47:46.880 align:start position:0%
laws of other states um frankly we we
 
01:47:48.270 --> 01:47:48.280 align:start position:0%
don't care what they are the the
 
01:47:50.709 --> 01:47:50.719 align:start position:0%
established precedent for all states is
 
01:47:52.510 --> 01:47:52.520 align:start position:0%
that we set the rules of the road for
 
01:47:54.350 --> 01:47:54.360 align:start position:0%
our own own State and they're
 
01:47:56.709 --> 01:47:56.719 align:start position:0%
different for example you can drive in
 
01:47:58.589 --> 01:47:58.599 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire without insurance I live
 
01:48:00.830 --> 01:48:00.840 align:start position:0%
on the Vermont border I can drive six
 
01:48:02.750 --> 01:48:02.760 align:start position:0%
miles from my house and all of a sudden
 
01:48:05.310 --> 01:48:05.320 align:start position:0%
be guilty of driving without insurance
 
01:48:08.430 --> 01:48:08.440 align:start position:0%
if I didn't have any and a $1,000 fine
 
01:48:10.430 --> 01:48:10.440 align:start position:0%
and I believe you can hit criminal level
 
01:48:13.310 --> 01:48:13.320 align:start position:0%
on that pretty quickly 15y olds in
 
01:48:15.350 --> 01:48:15.360 align:start position:0%
Florida can get learner permits they
 
01:48:16.990 --> 01:48:17.000 align:start position:0%
still can't operate in New Hampshire I
 
01:48:19.830 --> 01:48:19.840 align:start position:0%
mean there there's a myriad of laws that
 
01:48:22.430 --> 01:48:22.440 align:start position:0%
other states set that we don't recognize
 
01:48:24.629 --> 01:48:24.639 align:start position:0%
so that that's a wellestablished
 
01:48:28.390 --> 01:48:28.400 align:start position:0%
precedent we have every right to decide
 
01:48:30.510 --> 01:48:30.520 align:start position:0%
to do something like this and frankly
 
01:48:34.870 --> 01:48:34.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:37.470 --> 01:48:37.480 align:start position:0%
business I will add to that too from a
 
01:48:39.189 --> 01:48:39.199 align:start position:0%
comment I heard earlier that there are
 
01:48:41.669 --> 01:48:41.679 align:start position:0%
laws strictly governing uh detentions
 
01:48:43.310 --> 01:48:43.320 align:start position:0%
and how long somebody can be detained on
 
01:48:47.510 --> 01:48:47.520 align:start position:0%
the side of the road um and also that
 
01:48:49.189 --> 01:48:49.199 align:start position:0%
only some of the states put markings on
 
01:48:51.990 --> 01:48:52.000 align:start position:0%
the license not all well then if they
 
01:48:55.870 --> 01:48:55.880 align:start position:0%
don't then they may not be caught here
 
01:48:57.990 --> 01:48:58.000 align:start position:0%
if you will but but it will work with
 
01:49:00.109 --> 01:49:00.119 align:start position:0%
the states that do put a marking on it
 
01:49:03.030 --> 01:49:03.040 align:start position:0%
so uh not every bill is perfect anybody
 
01:49:05.270 --> 01:49:05.280 align:start position:0%
else representative a one more quick
 
01:49:06.990 --> 01:49:07.000 align:start position:0%
comment in Maine you can marry your
 
01:49:09.550 --> 01:49:09.560 align:start position:0%
first cousin in New Hampshire you cannot
 
01:49:10.790 --> 01:49:10.800 align:start position:0%
but New Hampshire does not have the
 
01:49:14.030 --> 01:49:14.040 align:start position:0%
right to invalidate a main marriage or a
 
01:49:16.990 --> 01:49:17.000 align:start position:0%
main marriage license so it the Full
 
01:49:17.870 --> 01:49:17.880 align:start position:0%
Faith and Credit Clause of the
 
01:49:22.310 --> 01:49:22.320 align:start position:0%
Constitution is what supports this and
 
01:49:24.189 --> 01:49:24.199 align:start position:0%
uh it's it's been tested in many many
 
01:49:25.950 --> 01:49:25.960 align:start position:0%
times and the interstate compact says
 
01:49:28.030 --> 01:49:28.040 align:start position:0%
that we're our our rules are close
 
01:49:29.310 --> 01:49:29.320 align:start position:0%
enough that we will not invalidate
 
01:49:31.790 --> 01:49:31.800 align:start position:0%
somebody else's driver's license based
 
01:49:34.870 --> 01:49:34.880 align:start position:0%
on uh any arbitrary laws within the
 
01:49:37.229 --> 01:49:37.239 align:start position:0%
state that if we recog they recognize
 
01:49:39.629 --> 01:49:39.639 align:start position:0%
our rules for for granting a driver's
 
01:49:40.910 --> 01:49:40.920 align:start position:0%
license we recognize their rules for
 
01:49:42.350 --> 01:49:42.360 align:start position:0%
driving granting a driver's license we
 
01:49:44.149 --> 01:49:44.159 align:start position:0%
don't automatically invalidate a Florida
 
01:49:45.910 --> 01:49:45.920 align:start position:0%
Driver's License just because they allow
 
01:49:48.830 --> 01:49:48.840 align:start position:0%
15 year olds to drive we don't we don't
 
01:49:51.390 --> 01:49:51.400 align:start position:0%
invalidate U somebody
 
01:49:53.350 --> 01:49:53.360 align:start position:0%
else's uh
 
01:49:55.470 --> 01:49:55.480 align:start position:0%
licenses just because we have a
 
01:49:57.870 --> 01:49:57.880 align:start position:0%
different set of rules and I don't see
 
01:49:59.990 --> 01:50:00.000 align:start position:0%
how this applies um all the driver's
 
01:50:01.229 --> 01:50:01.239 align:start position:0%
license is supposed to say is whether
 
01:50:03.189 --> 01:50:03.199 align:start position:0%
you're you're legally allowed to drive
 
01:50:03.199 --> 01:50:04.510 align:start position:0%
you're you're legally allowed to drive
that's

01:50:04.510 --> 01:50:04.520 align:start position:0%
that's
 
01:50:07.070 --> 01:50:07.080 align:start position:0%
it that's all I
 
01:50:09.750 --> 01:50:09.760 align:start position:0%
have okay looks like we do have two
 
01:50:11.629 --> 01:50:11.639 align:start position:0%
different opinions on this we could keep
 
01:50:13.109 --> 01:50:13.119 align:start position:0%
going for hours do you have anything
 
01:50:15.030 --> 01:50:15.040 align:start position:0%
else representative St Clair I'm not
 
01:50:16.790 --> 01:50:16.800 align:start position:0%
going to stop you either
 
01:50:20.750 --> 01:50:20.760 align:start position:0%
but I just thank you Mr chair I just um
 
01:50:23.390 --> 01:50:23.400 align:start position:0%
I just wonder where this goes uh
 
01:50:26.270 --> 01:50:26.280 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure of the drivers test that
 
01:50:28.589 --> 01:50:28.599 align:start position:0%
other states give maybe they're not as
 
01:50:30.350 --> 01:50:30.360 align:start position:0%
good as our our test we give in this
 
01:50:32.589 --> 01:50:32.599 align:start position:0%
state I mean you can just go on and on
 
01:50:35.669 --> 01:50:35.679 align:start position:0%
with this and I just think um I can see
 
01:50:37.629 --> 01:50:37.639 align:start position:0%
walls going up around all of our state
 
01:50:40.030 --> 01:50:40.040 align:start position:0%
borders uh maybe that's what some people
 
01:50:41.990 --> 01:50:42.000 align:start position:0%
want to stop anybody from coming into
 
01:50:45.189 --> 01:50:45.199 align:start position:0%
this state with their driver's license
 
01:50:47.709 --> 01:50:47.719 align:start position:0%
and when we heard about rapist and
 
01:50:49.669 --> 01:50:49.679 align:start position:0%
terrorists coming over the border to the
 
01:50:51.950 --> 01:50:51.960 align:start position:0%
introduction of this bill for our day of
 
01:50:55.189 --> 01:50:55.199 align:start position:0%
hearings it had absolutely nothing to do
 
01:50:56.790 --> 01:50:56.800 align:start position:0%
with what we're talking about here yet
 
01:50:58.510 --> 01:50:58.520 align:start position:0%
these are the I don't know if you call
 
01:51:00.109 --> 01:51:00.119 align:start position:0%
them a dog whistle or what but the the
 
01:51:01.669 --> 01:51:01.679 align:start position:0%
stuff that's thrown out there to try to
 
01:51:03.950 --> 01:51:03.960 align:start position:0%
wrap around why we need these bills and
 
01:51:05.470 --> 01:51:05.480 align:start position:0%
I just think this is a very bad one
 
01:51:07.589 --> 01:51:07.599 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr
 
01:51:09.629 --> 01:51:09.639 align:start position:0%
chair we need these
 
01:51:13.310 --> 01:51:13.320 align:start position:0%
bills in many people's opinions because
 
01:51:15.350 --> 01:51:15.360 align:start position:0%
the federal government keeps doing
 
01:51:17.310 --> 01:51:17.320 align:start position:0%
things that cause us a reason to come up
 
01:51:20.350 --> 01:51:20.360 align:start position:0%
with Solutions anybody else from the
 
01:51:23.149 --> 01:51:23.159 align:start position:0%
committee representative and I forget
 
01:51:25.350 --> 01:51:25.360 align:start position:0%
again that's okay it's collabro collabro
 
01:51:27.109 --> 01:51:27.119 align:start position:0%
I apologize I'm going to agree with that
 
01:51:29.629 --> 01:51:29.639 align:start position:0%
last statement there are a lot of things
 
01:51:32.069 --> 01:51:32.079 align:start position:0%
that need to change with immigration in
 
01:51:33.669 --> 01:51:33.679 align:start position:0%
order to protect our people better in
 
01:51:36.270 --> 01:51:36.280 align:start position:0%
this state and I speak to that because I
 
01:51:38.669 --> 01:51:38.679 align:start position:0%
used to be the person who did addiction
 
01:51:40.790 --> 01:51:40.800 align:start position:0%
medicine for the homeless in this
 
01:51:43.510 --> 01:51:43.520 align:start position:0%
state and um nobody wants pentan a out
 
01:51:45.350 --> 01:51:45.360 align:start position:0%
of this state more than
 
01:51:48.069 --> 01:51:48.079 align:start position:0%
me um I used to live in a border state
 
01:51:50.270 --> 01:51:50.280 align:start position:0%
in California and Arizona for years I've
 
01:51:52.790 --> 01:51:52.800 align:start position:0%
seen this bill
 
01:51:54.069 --> 01:51:54.079 align:start position:0%
and it killed my
 
01:51:56.910 --> 01:51:56.920 align:start position:0%
grandmother there were people who were
 
01:51:58.950 --> 01:51:58.960 align:start position:0%
undocumented immigrants they did not
 
01:52:00.310 --> 01:52:00.320 align:start position:0%
have a driver's license because
 
01:52:01.910 --> 01:52:01.920 align:start position:0%
California would not administer it to
 
01:52:04.109 --> 01:52:04.119 align:start position:0%
them they fled the scene of the accident
 
01:52:06.470 --> 01:52:06.480 align:start position:0%
my grandmother got a fractured hip and
 
01:52:09.629 --> 01:52:09.639 align:start position:0%
died within about six months of that
 
01:52:12.870 --> 01:52:12.880 align:start position:0%
when these laws are enacted they have
 
01:52:15.510 --> 01:52:15.520 align:start position:0%
consequences I cannot support something
 
01:52:17.550 --> 01:52:17.560 align:start position:0%
that is only really for two states that
 
01:52:18.950 --> 01:52:18.960 align:start position:0%
have something on a driver's license
 
01:52:21.709 --> 01:52:21.719 align:start position:0%
that says this is an undocumented person
 
01:52:24.350 --> 01:52:24.360 align:start position:0%
and for that reason I won't support
 
01:52:27.109 --> 01:52:27.119 align:start position:0%
it anybody
 
01:52:31.589 --> 01:52:31.599 align:start position:0%

discussion on the bill just I would

speak to my motion um I think we've
 
01:53:58.430 --> 01:53:58.440 align:start position:0%
heard all the arguments um and I would
 
01:54:00.950 --> 01:54:00.960 align:start position:0%
urge my colleagues to look at the the
 
01:54:04.589 --> 01:54:04.599 align:start position:0%
the bigger picture and um I believe
 
01:54:06.990 --> 01:54:07.000 align:start position:0%
that's enough
 
01:54:10.350 --> 01:54:10.360 align:start position:0%

get there yet uh but I still wouldn't
 
01:54:19.950 --> 01:54:19.960 align:start position:0%
use that as a reason not to do what we

01:57:19.589 --> 01:57:19.599 align:start position:0%

01:57:22.830 --> 01:57:22.840 align:start position:0%
motion to reconsider house bill
 
01:57:26.910 --> 01:57:26.920 align:start position:0%
501 a Senate Bill house uh five Senate
 
01:57:26.920 --> 01:57:29.149 align:start position:0%
501 a Senate Bill house uh five Senate
Bill

01:57:29.149 --> 01:57:29.159 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
01:57:32.669 --> 01:57:32.679 align:start position:0%
501 um reconsideration has been moved is
 
01:57:35.870 --> 01:57:35.880 align:start position:0%
there second representative
 
01:57:39.510 --> 01:57:39.520 align:start position:0%
Vu did you care to speak to your
 
01:57:42.109 --> 01:57:42.119 align:start position:0%
motion very briefly Mr chairman thank
 
01:57:45.750 --> 01:57:45.760 align:start position:0%
you um I brought this motion forward
 
01:57:48.470 --> 01:57:48.480 align:start position:0%
because it became clear to me and uh
 
01:57:52.310 --> 01:57:52.320 align:start position:0%
that one of the members uh
 
01:57:55.750 --> 01:57:55.760 align:start position:0%
uh made an error in their vote and would
 
01:57:58.189 --> 01:57:58.199 align:start position:0%
like the opportunity to reconsider that
 
01:58:00.669 --> 01:58:00.679 align:start position:0%
vote and so this is the proper format
 
01:58:02.910 --> 01:58:02.920 align:start position:0%
and methodology that we have available
 
01:58:05.790 --> 01:58:05.800 align:start position:0%
to us in order to do
 
01:58:08.629 --> 01:58:08.639 align:start position:0%
that I'll just say this as you know I
 
01:58:09.790 --> 01:58:09.800 align:start position:0%
probably know what the outcome of this
 
01:58:11.550 --> 01:58:11.560 align:start position:0%
is going to be but that doesn't matter
 
01:58:12.910 --> 01:58:12.920 align:start position:0%
what does matter is what I mentioned
 
01:58:14.629 --> 01:58:14.639 align:start position:0%
before that we have a tradition in of
 
01:58:16.350 --> 01:58:16.360 align:start position:0%
getting along in this committee and I
 
01:58:18.390 --> 01:58:18.400 align:start position:0%
want that to continue but more
 
01:58:20.350 --> 01:58:20.360 align:start position:0%
importantly I also have a great amount
 
01:58:22.310 --> 01:58:22.320 align:start position:0%
of respect for representative Rich who I
 
01:58:23.709 --> 01:58:23.719 align:start position:0%
believe we have served together for 10
 
01:58:25.589 --> 01:58:25.599 align:start position:0%
years now and if she tells me she made a
 
01:58:27.310 --> 01:58:27.320 align:start position:0%
mistake then I'm going to Grant the
 
01:58:29.310 --> 01:58:29.320 align:start position:0%
reconsideration which I already have in
 
01:58:32.510 --> 01:58:32.520 align:start position:0%
in essence uh but we'll also support
 
01:58:35.790 --> 01:58:35.800 align:start position:0%
it uh anybody else from the committee

01:59:52.950 --> 01:59:52.960 align:start position:0%
minute okay
 
01:59:55.990 --> 01:59:56.000 align:start position:0%
uh Senate Bill 501 uh reconsideration
 
01:59:57.589 --> 01:59:57.599 align:start position:0%
has been adopted I'll open up the
 
02:00:00.910 --> 02:00:00.920 align:start position:0%
executive session on 501 and bear with
 
02:00:02.229 --> 02:00:02.239 align:start position:0%
me I haven't gone through this process
 
02:00:04.109 --> 02:00:04.119 align:start position:0%
but I think I'm taking the right steps
 
02:00:06.430 --> 02:00:06.440 align:start position:0%
is there a motion on Senate Bill
 
02:00:19.589 --> 02:00:19.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:21.750 --> 02:00:21.760 align:start position:0%
to yes all right so the motion on the
 
02:00:23.750 --> 02:00:23.760 align:start position:0%
floor is inexpedient to
 
02:00:25.950 --> 02:00:25.960 align:start position:0%
legislate and with the reconsideration
 
02:00:27.629 --> 02:00:27.639 align:start position:0%
we'll we'll vote on that again I'll ask
 
02:00:29.149 --> 02:00:29.159 align:start position:0%

slog but I think that um I'm
 
02:04:39.790 --> 02:04:39.800 align:start position:0%
appreciative particularly of my
 
02:04:42.950 --> 02:04:42.960 align:start position:0%
colleagues in the committee who voted
 
02:04:45.229 --> 02:04:45.239 align:start position:0%
overwhelmingly for reconsideration that
 
02:04:51.750 --> 02:04:51.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:53.589 --> 02:04:53.599 align:start position:0%
representative Hill thank you Mr
 
02:04:55.270 --> 02:04:55.280 align:start position:0%
chairman I think the committee is lucky
 
02:04:56.910 --> 02:04:56.920 align:start position:0%
to have had a chairman that would be
 
02:05:00.310 --> 02:05:00.320 align:start position:0%
willing to do the things that he did um
 
02:05:03.229 --> 02:05:03.239 align:start position:0%
I also think that uh we owe thanks to
 
02:05:05.750 --> 02:05:05.760 align:start position:0%
our clerk who uh has kept us on an even
 
02:05:07.589 --> 02:05:07.599 align:start position:0%
Keel through the whole
 
02:05:11.229 --> 02:05:11.239 align:start position:0%

I yep representative Smith thank you so
 
02:06:39.430 --> 02:06:39.440 align:start position:0%
for years this committee was fortunate
 
02:06:41.669 --> 02:06:41.679 align:start position:0%
to have Superstar committee researchers
 
02:06:44.310 --> 02:06:44.320 align:start position:0%
we had Nancy lavenus back in the day and
 
02:06:48.669 --> 02:06:48.679 align:start position:0%
then Gen 4 who is extremely qualified
 
02:06:51.830 --> 02:06:51.840 align:start position:0%
diligent I I had a big problem with Jen
 
02:06:54.390 --> 02:06:54.400 align:start position:0%
when I'd have a question top of mine so
 
02:06:56.990 --> 02:06:57.000 align:start position:0%
I send an email off I don't know on a
 
02:06:58.589 --> 02:06:58.599 align:start position:0%
Saturday and she answers me on a
 
02:06:59.950 --> 02:06:59.960 align:start position:0%
Saturday night I'm like please stop
 
02:07:02.510 --> 02:07:02.520 align:start position:0%
working okay have a life but she was
 
02:07:04.910 --> 02:07:04.920 align:start position:0%
great so we were spoiled that way and
 
02:07:06.910 --> 02:07:06.920 align:start position:0%
then we got a new committee researcher
 
02:07:09.390 --> 02:07:09.400 align:start position:0%
and I will tell you what he doesn't want
 
02:07:11.549 --> 02:07:11.559 align:start position:0%
me to tell you he was prepared to hate
 
02:07:14.669 --> 02:07:14.679 align:start position:0%
you after all of that and it's like
 
02:07:17.149 --> 02:07:17.159 align:start position:0%
great we get the new guy I don't have
 
02:07:20.430 --> 02:07:20.440 align:start position:0%
time for that and it was very quickly
 
02:07:22.189 --> 02:07:22.199 align:start position:0%
that he was coming to me is speaking
 
02:07:24.430 --> 02:07:24.440 align:start position:0%
very highly of you thank you for
 
02:07:25.990 --> 02:07:26.000 align:start position:0%
everything that you do and you have
 
02:08:09.669 --> 02:08:09.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:11.390 --> 02:08:11.400 align:start position:0%
speaking of our committee researcher
 
02:08:12.910 --> 02:08:12.920 align:start position:0%
looking I was looking for the side by
 
02:08:14.669 --> 02:08:14.679 align:start position:0%
side on the sended message for House
 
02:08:30.510 --> 02:08:30.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:31.629 --> 02:08:31.639 align:start position:0%
okay while we're waiting we're looking
 
02:08:33.390 --> 02:08:33.400 align:start position:0%
into just one change that the Senate uh
 
02:08:35.870 --> 02:08:35.880 align:start position:0%
made on House Bill 1550 but we'll do
 
02:08:37.189 --> 02:08:37.199 align:start position:0%
this one just for a consensus of the
 
02:08:38.950 --> 02:08:38.960 align:start position:0%
committee House Bill 12
 
02:08:41.109 --> 02:08:41.119 align:start position:0%
11:22 which was the bill that we passed
 
02:08:43.750 --> 02:08:43.760 align:start position:0%
relative to lights on motor vehicles uh
 
02:08:45.669 --> 02:08:45.679 align:start position:0%
the Senate just made one change uh just
 
02:08:47.069 --> 02:08:47.079 align:start position:0%
for clarity and I believe this came from
 
02:08:48.950 --> 02:08:48.960 align:start position:0%
the Department's recommendations the
 
02:08:50.629 --> 02:08:50.639 align:start position:0%
safety that is the provisions of this
 
02:08:53.030 --> 02:08:53.040 align:start position:0%
section shall not apply to a vehicle
 
02:08:55.430 --> 02:08:55.440 align:start position:0%
with original equipment manufacturer OEM
 
02:08:57.510 --> 02:08:57.520 align:start position:0%
front Lighting systems or a front
 
02:08:58.910 --> 02:08:58.920 align:start position:0%
lighting system of a similar type
 
02:09:00.350 --> 02:09:00.360 align:start position:0%
installed as standard equipment by the
 
02:09:02.629 --> 02:09:02.639 align:start position:0%
Vehicle Manufacturer so in other words
 
02:09:04.790 --> 02:09:04.800 align:start position:0%
it's just a a general blanket that if it
 
02:09:07.669 --> 02:09:07.679 align:start position:0%
comes from the factory it's good um so
 
02:09:09.790 --> 02:09:09.800 align:start position:0%
any objection to concurring with their
 
02:09:11.870 --> 02:09:11.880 align:start position:0%
change all right so that's what we'll do
 
02:09:14.549 --> 02:09:14.559 align:start position:0%
on that one and there's one minor change
 
02:09:16.910 --> 02:09:16.920 align:start position:0%
they made to the seasonal speed limit
 
02:09:18.830 --> 02:09:18.840 align:start position:0%
Bill too we're just trying to identify
 
02:09:21.790 --> 02:09:21.800 align:start position:0%
exactly what word was added uh I believe
 
02:09:23.430 --> 02:09:23.440 align:start position:0%
will be on the same in the same
 
02:09:30.510 --> 02:09:30.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:32.669 --> 02:09:32.679 align:start position:0%
second and yes I should have done this
 
02:10:19.629 --> 02:10:19.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:23.549 --> 02:10:23.559 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:26.270 --> 02:10:26.280 align:start position:0%
they added one word to the bill just for
 
02:10:28.750 --> 02:10:28.760 align:start position:0%
clarity the
 
02:10:32.990 --> 02:10:33.000 align:start position:0%
original the original Bill mentioned
 
02:10:35.629 --> 02:10:35.639 align:start position:0%
um reasonable and safe conditions upon a
 
02:10:36.990 --> 02:10:37.000 align:start position:0%
part of a highway system that a
 
02:10:38.990 --> 02:10:39.000 align:start position:0%
municipality seasonally
 
02:10:42.430 --> 02:10:42.440 align:start position:0%
congested and the amendment reasonable
 
02:10:44.229 --> 02:10:44.239 align:start position:0%
and safe conditions upon any part of a
 
02:10:46.109 --> 02:10:46.119 align:start position:0%
municipal highway system that is
 
02:10:49.270 --> 02:10:49.280 align:start position:0%
seasonally congested sounds like just a
 
02:10:50.830 --> 02:10:50.840 align:start position:0%
grammar change in adding the word
 
02:10:50.840 --> 02:10:52.030 align:start position:0%
grammar change in adding the word
municip

02:10:52.030 --> 02:10:52.040 align:start position:0%
municip
 
02:10:54.310 --> 02:10:54.320 align:start position:0%
I'm fine with it any objections for
 
02:10:56.149 --> 02:10:56.159 align:start position:0%
concurrence seeing none that's what
 
02:10:58.470 --> 02:10:58.480 align:start position:0%
we'll do all right that's it uh if
 
02:11:00.589 --> 02:11:00.599 align:start position:0%
there's nothing else for Jour all right
 
02:11:00.599 --> 02:11:02.790 align:start position:0%
there's nothing else for Jour all right
thank

02:11:02.790 --> 02:11:02.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:06.229 --> 02:11:06.239 align:start position:0%
you and reports I do need before people
 
02:11:08.310 --> 02:11:08.320 align:start position:0%
leave today I've got some of them
 
02:11:11.510 --> 02:11:11.520 align:start position:0%
coming and before before you leave we'll
 
02:11:13.270 --> 02:11:13.280 align:start position:0%
look at a debate sheet too so we can get
 
02:11:16.069 --> 02:11:16.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:16.079 --> 02:11:20.229 align:start position:0%
 
today

02:11:20.229 --> 02:11:20.239 align:start position:0%
