00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:57.290 align:start position:0%
 
skip

00:09:57.290 --> 00:09:57.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:00.050 --> 00:10:00.060 align:start position:0%
perfect so um
 
00:10:03.230 --> 00:10:03.240 align:start position:0%
earlier or last meeting
 
00:10:05.810 --> 00:10:05.820 align:start position:0%
um I representative Dolan had asked for
 
00:10:07.970 --> 00:10:07.980 align:start position:0%
to see which
 
00:10:07.980 --> 00:10:08.570 align:start position:0%
to see which
um

00:10:08.570 --> 00:10:08.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:11.090 --> 00:10:11.100 align:start position:0%
recommendations from the West
 
00:10:14.449 --> 00:10:14.459 align:start position:0%
um committee on commissions
 
00:10:15.829 --> 00:10:15.839 align:start position:0%
um recommendations were adopted and
 
00:10:18.050 --> 00:10:18.060 align:start position:0%
which ones weren't and so we went back
 
00:10:18.060 --> 00:10:19.490 align:start position:0%
which ones weren't and so we went back
through

00:10:19.490 --> 00:10:19.500 align:start position:0%
through
 
00:10:22.490 --> 00:10:22.500 align:start position:0%
and um it's kind of broke down all of
 
00:10:24.530 --> 00:10:24.540 align:start position:0%
the recommendations from the previous
 
00:10:28.670 --> 00:10:28.680 align:start position:0%
ones and um were able to update as much
 
00:10:30.829 --> 00:10:30.839 align:start position:0%
or see how which ones were adopted or
 
00:10:30.839 --> 00:10:31.790 align:start position:0%
or see how which ones were adopted or
not

00:10:31.790 --> 00:10:31.800 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:10:33.470 --> 00:10:33.480 align:start position:0%
um there are some
 
00:10:36.110 --> 00:10:36.120 align:start position:0%
unknown statuses at this time for some
 
00:10:38.570 --> 00:10:38.580 align:start position:0%
of them but um we are currently working
 
00:10:40.970 --> 00:10:40.980 align:start position:0%
to keep let me interrupt you for a
 
00:10:42.410 --> 00:10:42.420 align:start position:0%
second just bring Karen up today we're
 
00:10:44.870 --> 00:10:44.880 align:start position:0%
going through
 
00:10:48.610 --> 00:10:48.620 align:start position:0%
the volumes of things that you had
 
00:10:51.949 --> 00:10:51.959 align:start position:0%
recommended had decided upon the last
 
00:10:51.959 --> 00:10:53.090 align:start position:0%
recommended had decided upon the last
inner

00:10:53.090 --> 00:10:53.100 align:start position:0%
inner
 
00:10:56.210 --> 00:10:56.220 align:start position:0%
iteration of this and so we had some
 
00:10:58.490 --> 00:10:58.500 align:start position:0%
questions about well it says they're
 
00:11:01.009 --> 00:11:01.019 align:start position:0%
going to do this did that happen
 
00:11:03.110 --> 00:11:03.120 align:start position:0%
so that's what we asked
 
00:11:05.269 --> 00:11:05.279 align:start position:0%
graduate back and look at it so go ahead
 
00:11:09.170 --> 00:11:09.180 align:start position:0%
so um that's that's basically on the
 
00:11:10.610 --> 00:11:10.620 align:start position:0%
um we were able to see which ones were
 
00:11:13.310 --> 00:11:13.320 align:start position:0%
adopted and I was about 12 45 in 2020
 
00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:14.630 align:start position:0%
adopted and I was about 12 45 in 2020
and

00:11:14.630 --> 00:11:14.640 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:11:17.030 --> 00:11:17.040 align:start position:0%
um house multiple 12 6 9 and 12 in 2022
 
00:11:19.850 --> 00:11:19.860 align:start position:0%
and we went through and just by
 
00:11:22.370 --> 00:11:22.380 align:start position:0%
recommendation by recommendation and see
 
00:11:24.110 --> 00:11:24.120 align:start position:0%
which ones were adopted in full
 
00:11:26.810 --> 00:11:26.820 align:start position:0%
partially adopted
 
00:11:29.930 --> 00:11:29.940 align:start position:0%
um there are some which are
 
00:11:31.550 --> 00:11:31.560 align:start position:0%
um we're either not adopted or the
 
00:11:33.410 --> 00:11:33.420 align:start position:0%
status of those is unknown at this time
 
00:11:37.190 --> 00:11:37.200 align:start position:0%
but we're still in the process of
 
00:11:40.250 --> 00:11:40.260 align:start position:0%
um either confirming those or
 
00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:41.210 align:start position:0%
um either confirming those or
um

00:11:41.210 --> 00:11:41.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:11:44.269 --> 00:11:44.279 align:start position:0%
if it if at all possible Works um we're
 
00:11:47.269 --> 00:11:47.279 align:start position:0%
in the process of that okay and um I
 
00:11:49.730 --> 00:11:49.740 align:start position:0%
know it's also asked about
 
00:11:51.769 --> 00:11:51.779 align:start position:0%
the mapping for all the committees as
 
00:11:51.779 --> 00:11:53.150 align:start position:0%
the mapping for all the committees as
well

00:11:53.150 --> 00:11:53.160 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:11:55.970 --> 00:11:55.980 align:start position:0%
um it's as a reminder
 
00:11:58.730 --> 00:11:58.740 align:start position:0%
what we had thought was one of our
 
00:11:58.740 --> 00:12:02.090 align:start position:0%
what we had thought was one of our
potential

00:12:02.090 --> 00:12:02.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:05.329 --> 00:12:05.339 align:start position:0%
open actions going forward was to look
 
00:12:05.339 --> 00:12:06.650 align:start position:0%
open actions going forward was to look
at

00:12:06.650 --> 00:12:06.660 align:start position:0%
at
 
00:12:06.660 --> 00:12:07.790 align:start position:0%
at
uh

00:12:07.790 --> 00:12:07.800 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:12:11.750 --> 00:12:11.760 align:start position:0%
perhaps tasking the our standing
 
00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:13.190 align:start position:0%
perhaps tasking the our standing
committees

00:12:13.190 --> 00:12:13.200 align:start position:0%
committees
 
00:12:16.009 --> 00:12:16.019 align:start position:0%
with overseeing or following up on a lot
 
00:12:18.710 --> 00:12:18.720 align:start position:0%
of these activities and seeing which
 
00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:20.269 align:start position:0%
of these activities and seeing which
ones

00:12:20.269 --> 00:12:20.279 align:start position:0%
ones
 
00:12:22.790 --> 00:12:22.800 align:start position:0%
like if if you're the chairman of
 
00:12:26.389 --> 00:12:26.399 align:start position:0%
committee X Y and Z which commissions do
 
00:12:28.610 --> 00:12:28.620 align:start position:0%
you have oversight over or could you
 
00:12:30.410 --> 00:12:30.420 align:start position:0%
have oversight over depending on the
 
00:12:30.420 --> 00:12:31.490 align:start position:0%
have oversight over depending on the
subject

00:12:31.490 --> 00:12:31.500 align:start position:0%
subject
 
00:12:34.269 --> 00:12:34.279 align:start position:0%
so we what we looked is for our
 
00:12:37.850 --> 00:12:37.860 align:start position:0%
assistance to help us do some mapping
 
00:12:41.569 --> 00:12:41.579 align:start position:0%
with this that these all map into this
 
00:12:43.430 --> 00:12:43.440 align:start position:0%
committee and these all map into this
 
00:12:46.009 --> 00:12:46.019 align:start position:0%
committee and these over here don't seem
 
00:12:48.290 --> 00:12:48.300 align:start position:0%
to map anywhere in the kind of uh they
 
00:12:50.389 --> 00:12:50.399 align:start position:0%
open so that one of the tasks was to
 
00:12:53.389 --> 00:12:53.399 align:start position:0%
create that mapping for us so we said
 
00:12:56.690 --> 00:12:56.700 align:start position:0%
okay uh the legend admin for example we
 
00:12:59.030 --> 00:12:59.040 align:start position:0%
could say you have
 
00:13:01.430 --> 00:13:01.440 align:start position:0%
according to our mapping you have 30
 
00:13:05.210 --> 00:13:05.220 align:start position:0%
commissions that you are connected to
 
00:13:05.220 --> 00:13:07.090 align:start position:0%
commissions that you are connected to
and

00:13:07.090 --> 00:13:07.100 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:13:10.310 --> 00:13:10.320 align:start position:0%
one of the one of the thoughts is that
 
00:13:13.310 --> 00:13:13.320 align:start position:0%
we need to rely on that committee chair
 
00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:14.690 align:start position:0%
we need to rely on that committee chair
person

00:13:14.690 --> 00:13:14.700 align:start position:0%
person
 
00:13:14.700 --> 00:13:16.490 align:start position:0%
person
to

00:13:16.490 --> 00:13:16.500 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:13:18.230 --> 00:13:18.240 align:start position:0%
provide some
 
00:13:20.990 --> 00:13:21.000 align:start position:0%
either supervision or direction or
 
00:13:23.870 --> 00:13:23.880 align:start position:0%
whatever whatever we decide
 
00:13:25.670 --> 00:13:25.680 align:start position:0%
they come from that committee chairs but
 
00:13:27.290 --> 00:13:27.300 align:start position:0%
first we need to know which Community
 
00:13:28.970 --> 00:13:28.980 align:start position:0%
chair has what
 
00:13:31.910 --> 00:13:31.920 align:start position:0%
so and that's that's to be completed
 
00:13:33.650 --> 00:13:33.660 align:start position:0%
probably within the next week or so um
 
00:13:35.750 --> 00:13:35.760 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure on the timeline of that as
 
00:13:37.009 --> 00:13:37.019 align:start position:0%
of yet
 
00:13:39.170 --> 00:13:39.180 align:start position:0%
um as we're also working out the same
 
00:13:41.569 --> 00:13:41.579 align:start position:0%
list as um as Deborah child as she's
 
00:13:43.069 --> 00:13:43.079 align:start position:0%
been working and she's also using that
 
00:13:45.710 --> 00:13:45.720 align:start position:0%
she's also updating that list as well so
 
00:13:47.750 --> 00:13:47.760 align:start position:0%
we don't want to make an additional list
 
00:13:50.090 --> 00:13:50.100 align:start position:0%
on top of that and kind of
 
00:13:52.370 --> 00:13:52.380 align:start position:0%
um reinvent the wheel is kind of so I'm
 
00:13:53.810 --> 00:13:53.820 align:start position:0%
not sure on the timeline on that as of
 
00:13:56.509 --> 00:13:56.519 align:start position:0%
yet but
 
00:13:58.610 --> 00:13:58.620 align:start position:0%
it's in process
 
00:14:01.069 --> 00:14:01.079 align:start position:0%
okay anybody have any questions Brad did
 
00:14:02.569 --> 00:14:02.579 align:start position:0%
you have anything else you wanted uh no
 
00:14:03.829 --> 00:14:03.839 align:start position:0%
that's pretty much I won't go through
 
00:14:05.690 --> 00:14:05.700 align:start position:0%
and read each thing because you have it
 
00:14:07.250 --> 00:14:07.260 align:start position:0%
in front of you but
 
00:14:08.870 --> 00:14:08.880 align:start position:0%
um it's kind of the current status of
 
00:14:11.030 --> 00:14:11.040 align:start position:0%
all the recommendations of the previous
 
00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:14.110 align:start position:0%
all the recommendations of the previous
um

00:14:14.110 --> 00:14:14.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:16.310 --> 00:14:16.320 align:start position:0%
sorry should we go through it a little
 
00:14:17.930 --> 00:14:17.940 align:start position:0%
bit though so we know what we're talking
 
00:14:21.470 --> 00:14:21.480 align:start position:0%
about except for the meeting
 
00:14:23.509 --> 00:14:23.519 align:start position:0%
I mean we got
 
00:14:26.210 --> 00:14:26.220 align:start position:0%
we got like for instance the issue about
 
00:14:29.030 --> 00:14:29.040 align:start position:0%
guidance I guess it's sort of what we're
 
00:14:30.710 --> 00:14:30.720 align:start position:0%
going to be that's on the bottom of page
 
00:14:32.509 --> 00:14:32.519 align:start position:0%
two that's sort of what we're going to
 
00:14:35.629 --> 00:14:35.639 align:start position:0%
be working on I think
 
00:14:35.639 --> 00:14:37.009 align:start position:0%
be working on I think
so

00:14:37.009 --> 00:14:37.019 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:14:37.019 --> 00:14:41.689 align:start position:0%
so
um

00:14:41.689 --> 00:14:41.699 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:44.329 --> 00:14:44.339 align:start position:0%
but no it was I believe this came up
 
00:14:46.009 --> 00:14:46.019 align:start position:0%
um the previous meeting as well but the
 
00:14:47.629 --> 00:14:47.639 align:start position:0%
the guidance for
 
00:14:50.210 --> 00:14:50.220 align:start position:0%
um remembers as their
 
00:14:53.150 --> 00:14:53.160 align:start position:0%
um yeah drafting these
 
00:14:54.889 --> 00:14:54.899 align:start position:0%
um study committees
 
00:14:54.899 --> 00:14:56.210 align:start position:0%
um study committees
um

00:14:56.210 --> 00:14:56.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:58.310 --> 00:14:58.320 align:start position:0%
again as right now it does not appear
 
00:15:02.269 --> 00:15:02.279 align:start position:0%
that has been adopted but um
 
00:15:03.949 --> 00:15:03.959 align:start position:0%
a Metro where I want in that process
 
00:15:06.170 --> 00:15:06.180 align:start position:0%
that is if I I'd have to double check on
 
00:15:09.050 --> 00:15:09.060 align:start position:0%
that but um it would be kind of by the
 
00:15:10.730 --> 00:15:10.740 align:start position:0%
way that was discussed at the last time
 
00:15:14.090 --> 00:15:14.100 align:start position:0%
we had talked about that if if a study
 
00:15:16.970 --> 00:15:16.980 align:start position:0%
commission was to be enacted that we
 
00:15:20.329 --> 00:15:20.339 align:start position:0%
talked about maybe creating a template
 
00:15:25.310 --> 00:15:25.320 align:start position:0%
or OLS say I'm representative
 
00:15:28.189 --> 00:15:28.199 align:start position:0%
X and I want to create a study committee
 
00:15:28.199 --> 00:15:29.030 align:start position:0%
X and I want to create a study committee
and

00:15:29.030 --> 00:15:29.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:15:32.090 --> 00:15:32.100 align:start position:0%
or a commission and here's the subject
 
00:15:34.910 --> 00:15:34.920 align:start position:0%
matter we would ask be asking OLS to
 
00:15:37.009 --> 00:15:37.019 align:start position:0%
come back to them and say Here's a
 
00:15:38.509 --> 00:15:38.519 align:start position:0%
template if you're going to have a study
 
00:15:41.689 --> 00:15:41.699 align:start position:0%
commission here's what needs to be in
 
00:15:43.430 --> 00:15:43.440 align:start position:0%
the framework of creating a study
 
00:15:45.170 --> 00:15:45.180 align:start position:0%
commission so that's what we're talking
 
00:15:46.550 --> 00:15:46.560 align:start position:0%
about I believe that is I believe that
 
00:15:48.230 --> 00:15:48.240 align:start position:0%
was discussed but as of right now that's
 
00:15:50.569 --> 00:15:50.579 align:start position:0%
not what has been adopted or anything
 
00:15:52.790 --> 00:15:52.800 align:start position:0%
but that would be right
 
00:15:56.389 --> 00:15:56.399 align:start position:0%
um I spoke with the uh the folks at OLS
 
00:15:57.650 --> 00:15:57.660 align:start position:0%
about that and they said that's
 
00:15:59.389 --> 00:15:59.399 align:start position:0%
something they could certainly do
 
00:16:02.150 --> 00:16:02.160 align:start position:0%
but we have to be in our Direction and
 
00:16:04.550 --> 00:16:04.560 align:start position:0%
do that they wouldn't do that just
 
00:16:06.050 --> 00:16:06.060 align:start position:0%
because they think it's the right thing
 
00:16:08.750 --> 00:16:08.760 align:start position:0%
to do they have to have to come from us
 
00:16:12.590 --> 00:16:12.600 align:start position:0%
did you Karen do you ever get down that
 
00:16:14.750 --> 00:16:14.760 align:start position:0%
path off of that as well
 
00:16:16.670 --> 00:16:16.680 align:start position:0%
I don't um
 
00:16:19.550 --> 00:16:19.560 align:start position:0%
not that far I mean part of the problem
 
00:16:22.850 --> 00:16:22.860 align:start position:0%
is what happens in OLS is a little bit
 
00:16:24.350 --> 00:16:24.360 align:start position:0%
of um
 
00:16:27.170 --> 00:16:27.180 align:start position:0%
a policy that's set by a particular
 
00:16:29.689 --> 00:16:29.699 align:start position:0%
speaker's office I mean the other
 
00:16:32.090 --> 00:16:32.100 align:start position:0%
problem that we ran into if you look at
 
00:16:34.310 --> 00:16:34.320 align:start position:0%
the dates of the reports that we did we
 
00:16:36.650 --> 00:16:36.660 align:start position:0%
were really in the teeth of covid and
 
00:16:38.990 --> 00:16:39.000 align:start position:0%
things got a little bit uh sidelined
 
00:16:43.850 --> 00:16:43.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:46.129 --> 00:16:46.139 align:start position:0%
I mean with your forbearance could could
 
00:16:49.129 --> 00:16:49.139 align:start position:0%
I just like talk for five minutes please
 
00:16:51.470 --> 00:16:51.480 align:start position:0%
and I can just sort of go through things
 
00:16:53.389 --> 00:16:53.399 align:start position:0%
because I've been thinking a lot about
 
00:16:55.850 --> 00:16:55.860 align:start position:0%
this and it does include a whole lot of
 
00:16:58.009 --> 00:16:58.019 align:start position:0%
intersecting pieces
 
00:17:00.170 --> 00:17:00.180 align:start position:0%
so I think
 
00:17:02.689 --> 00:17:02.699 align:start position:0%
it's hard to know where exactly to start
 
00:17:06.110 --> 00:17:06.120 align:start position:0%
but the first thing is that and I and
 
00:17:08.030 --> 00:17:08.040 align:start position:0%
Deborah has worked really hard on this
 
00:17:11.090 --> 00:17:11.100 align:start position:0%
in HCS is to know what the commissions
 
00:17:14.510 --> 00:17:14.520 align:start position:0%
are that we have that exist right so we
 
00:17:17.090 --> 00:17:17.100 align:start position:0%
have an Excel spreadsheet
 
00:17:20.809 --> 00:17:20.819 align:start position:0%
um and we know and we're more and more
 
00:17:22.970 --> 00:17:22.980 align:start position:0%
we have the we have the list of
 
00:17:26.449 --> 00:17:26.459 align:start position:0%
commissions we have the statutory
 
00:17:29.570 --> 00:17:29.580 align:start position:0%
Authority that created them
 
00:17:32.330 --> 00:17:32.340 align:start position:0%
um in the Excel spreadsheet that we were
 
00:17:36.350 --> 00:17:36.360 align:start position:0%
working with actually the the house or
 
00:17:38.210 --> 00:17:38.220 align:start position:0%
Senate committee that had jurisdiction
 
00:17:41.210 --> 00:17:41.220 align:start position:0%
over the subject matter was listed in a
 
00:17:44.210 --> 00:17:44.220 align:start position:0%
in a column so you may find Brad that
 
00:17:46.450 --> 00:17:46.460 align:start position:0%
some of that information is right there
 
00:17:50.029 --> 00:17:50.039 align:start position:0%
we have the administrative agency that a
 
00:17:52.250 --> 00:17:52.260 align:start position:0%
particular commission is associated with
 
00:17:52.260 --> 00:17:54.169 align:start position:0%
particular commission is associated with
listed

00:17:54.169 --> 00:17:54.179 align:start position:0%
listed
 
00:17:57.110 --> 00:17:57.120 align:start position:0%
and then you know there's when when we
 
00:17:59.090 --> 00:17:59.100 align:start position:0%
were working on it there's all kinds of
 
00:18:01.909 --> 00:18:01.919 align:start position:0%
information about how frequently they're
 
00:18:04.130 --> 00:18:04.140 align:start position:0%
meeting and that sort of thing to try to
 
00:18:06.529 --> 00:18:06.539 align:start position:0%
decide whether it's something that
 
00:18:09.350 --> 00:18:09.360 align:start position:0%
should go forward so
 
00:18:12.710 --> 00:18:12.720 align:start position:0%
that has to be a document from which a
 
00:18:16.669 --> 00:18:16.679 align:start position:0%
lot of our actions occur I think and I
 
00:18:19.549 --> 00:18:19.559 align:start position:0%
was thinking about it instead of
 
00:18:22.250 --> 00:18:22.260 align:start position:0%
us always trying to figure out whether a
 
00:18:24.770 --> 00:18:24.780 align:start position:0%
commission is really useful or Not by
 
00:18:26.810 --> 00:18:26.820 align:start position:0%
tracking how many times they're meeting
 
00:18:30.169 --> 00:18:30.179 align:start position:0%
I mean I think in some respects we
 
00:18:32.210 --> 00:18:32.220 align:start position:0%
should also try to get the
 
00:18:33.830 --> 00:18:33.840 align:start position:0%
administrative agency that they're
 
00:18:35.450 --> 00:18:35.460 align:start position:0%
associated with to take some
 
00:18:38.330 --> 00:18:38.340 align:start position:0%
responsibility for at least letting us
 
00:18:40.610 --> 00:18:40.620 align:start position:0%
know if they think that this has sort of
 
00:18:42.590 --> 00:18:42.600 align:start position:0%
run its course or some of the people
 
00:18:45.350 --> 00:18:45.360 align:start position:0%
that are involved in it
 
00:18:47.690 --> 00:18:47.700 align:start position:0%
um so if you have that as a so you have
 
00:18:50.090 --> 00:18:50.100 align:start position:0%
that as a bait you have that as a basic
 
00:18:53.750 --> 00:18:53.760 align:start position:0%
grounding document and what was put in
 
00:18:56.029 --> 00:18:56.039 align:start position:0%
the statute the last time was to be sure
 
00:18:59.090 --> 00:18:59.100 align:start position:0%
that that is updated on an annual basis
 
00:19:01.909 --> 00:19:01.919 align:start position:0%
I mean I think HCS will be updating it
 
00:19:04.610 --> 00:19:04.620 align:start position:0%
all the time but that that's provided to
 
00:19:06.350 --> 00:19:06.360 align:start position:0%
all the committee chairs right from the
 
00:19:09.230 --> 00:19:09.240 align:start position:0%
get-go so that when when committee
 
00:19:11.950 --> 00:19:11.960 align:start position:0%
chairs open up their standing committee
 
00:19:14.750 --> 00:19:14.760 align:start position:0%
operations they have something in front
 
00:19:16.970 --> 00:19:16.980 align:start position:0%
of them that they know so when there are
 
00:19:18.770 --> 00:19:18.780 align:start position:0%
requests that are coming in they have a
 
00:19:20.570 --> 00:19:20.580 align:start position:0%
basis to to
 
00:19:23.029 --> 00:19:23.039 align:start position:0%
um to work on and if you wanted to have
 
00:19:26.210 --> 00:19:26.220 align:start position:0%
somebody refine it down to just the the
 
00:19:29.930 --> 00:19:29.940 align:start position:0%
statutory commissions that relate to a
 
00:19:33.710 --> 00:19:33.720 align:start position:0%
particular agency you could do that too
 
00:19:35.570 --> 00:19:35.580 align:start position:0%
so then the other thing I was thinking
 
00:19:39.289 --> 00:19:39.299 align:start position:0%
about a lot of our issues start with
 
00:19:41.630 --> 00:19:41.640 align:start position:0%
um somebody coming up with an idea to
 
00:19:43.310 --> 00:19:43.320 align:start position:0%
have a study committee or a commission
 
00:19:45.650 --> 00:19:45.660 align:start position:0%
and going into OLS right
 
00:19:45.660 --> 00:19:48.770 align:start position:0%
and going into OLS right
so

00:19:48.770 --> 00:19:48.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:53.810 --> 00:19:53.820 align:start position:0%
I think that we should put together some
 
00:19:58.310 --> 00:19:58.320 align:start position:0%
sort of infrastructure to enable OLS to
 
00:20:01.370 --> 00:20:01.380 align:start position:0%
ask a few questions of these people and
 
00:20:03.529 --> 00:20:03.539 align:start position:0%
to sort of require that the people that
 
00:20:05.450 --> 00:20:05.460 align:start position:0%
are coming in with the request have done
 
00:20:08.510 --> 00:20:08.520 align:start position:0%
it and one of the main things is to make
 
00:20:10.610 --> 00:20:10.620 align:start position:0%
sure that those people have done the
 
00:20:13.070 --> 00:20:13.080 align:start position:0%
research that they need to do to find
 
00:20:15.049 --> 00:20:15.059 align:start position:0%
out whether a commissioner committee has
 
00:20:17.150 --> 00:20:17.160 align:start position:0%
already been established to study this
 
00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:18.169 align:start position:0%
already been established to study this
subject

00:20:18.169 --> 00:20:18.179 align:start position:0%
subject
 
00:20:20.570 --> 00:20:20.580 align:start position:0%
and it was pretty clear to me that Dave
 
00:20:24.230 --> 00:20:24.240 align:start position:0%
uh you know the staff themselves at the
 
00:20:26.750 --> 00:20:26.760 align:start position:0%
time of the request doesn't have the
 
00:20:28.610 --> 00:20:28.620 align:start position:0%
time to go back and do the research
 
00:20:31.430 --> 00:20:31.440 align:start position:0%
themselves so if we have this basic
 
00:20:33.890 --> 00:20:33.900 align:start position:0%
document it shouldn't be that hard to do
 
00:20:35.690 --> 00:20:35.700 align:start position:0%
that research especially if it's
 
00:20:39.590 --> 00:20:39.600 align:start position:0%
available on the on the website
 
00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:41.270 align:start position:0%
available on the on the website
so

00:20:41.270 --> 00:20:41.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:20:43.669 --> 00:20:43.679 align:start position:0%
the other thing that I think we need to
 
00:20:47.510 --> 00:20:47.520 align:start position:0%
do and work with Els Is AO OLS in what
 
00:20:49.190 --> 00:20:49.200 align:start position:0%
you were saying is to come up with a
 
00:20:50.870 --> 00:20:50.880 align:start position:0%
template for study committees and
 
00:20:53.270 --> 00:20:53.280 align:start position:0%
commissions things that will always be
 
00:20:55.909 --> 00:20:55.919 align:start position:0%
in there and those things should be
 
00:20:59.990 --> 00:21:00.000 align:start position:0%
shared not only with members but with
 
00:21:02.950 --> 00:21:02.960 align:start position:0%
and you know there should be a mutual
 
00:21:05.630 --> 00:21:05.640 align:start position:0%
understanding of what these things will
 
00:21:08.570 --> 00:21:08.580 align:start position:0%
include including reporting requirements
 
00:21:11.210 --> 00:21:11.220 align:start position:0%
repeal dates and all that sort of thing
 
00:21:14.150 --> 00:21:14.160 align:start position:0%
and I think one of the tasks of this
 
00:21:17.029 --> 00:21:17.039 align:start position:0%
committee could be what what we think
 
00:21:21.169 --> 00:21:21.179 align:start position:0%
any well-structured commission or study
 
00:21:23.390 --> 00:21:23.400 align:start position:0%
committee should have in it like
 
00:21:26.510 --> 00:21:26.520 align:start position:0%
clear reporting requirements membership
 
00:21:28.549 --> 00:21:28.559 align:start position:0%
clear direction of what they're going to
 
00:21:31.789 --> 00:21:31.799 align:start position:0%
study all that sort of thing and I think
 
00:21:35.029 --> 00:21:35.039 align:start position:0%
we could do everybody a good service if
 
00:21:37.669 --> 00:21:37.679 align:start position:0%
we kind of worked out a template for
 
00:21:39.529 --> 00:21:39.539 align:start position:0%
because that's where a lot of these
 
00:21:41.810 --> 00:21:41.820 align:start position:0%
issues start is right at OS when people
 
00:21:43.730 --> 00:21:43.740 align:start position:0%
march in the door right
 
00:21:47.149 --> 00:21:47.159 align:start position:0%
the other issue that comes up is that
 
00:21:50.390 --> 00:21:50.400 align:start position:0%
members come in with ideas of who they
 
00:21:53.029 --> 00:21:53.039 align:start position:0%
want as members of these commissions if
 
00:21:55.669 --> 00:21:55.679 align:start position:0%
their statutory commissions and they
 
00:21:58.490 --> 00:21:58.500 align:start position:0%
don't even reach out to find out whether
 
00:22:01.130 --> 00:22:01.140 align:start position:0%
like a certain entity even wants to
 
00:22:01.140 --> 00:22:02.690 align:start position:0%
like a certain entity even wants to
participate

00:22:02.690 --> 00:22:02.700 align:start position:0%
participate
 
00:22:05.090 --> 00:22:05.100 align:start position:0%
and sometimes they have the wrong name
 
00:22:07.010 --> 00:22:07.020 align:start position:0%
of the organization
 
00:22:07.020 --> 00:22:08.630 align:start position:0%
of the organization
and

00:22:08.630 --> 00:22:08.640 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:22:11.450 --> 00:22:11.460 align:start position:0%
then if a bill passes that these things
 
00:22:14.149 --> 00:22:14.159 align:start position:0%
aren't corrected it falls on house
 
00:22:16.370 --> 00:22:16.380 align:start position:0%
committee services to work all that
 
00:22:18.230 --> 00:22:18.240 align:start position:0%
stuff out and that's I think part of
 
00:22:21.470 --> 00:22:21.480 align:start position:0%
what really drives them crazy so you
 
00:22:24.049 --> 00:22:24.059 align:start position:0%
know people always like to have bia on
 
00:22:26.330 --> 00:22:26.340 align:start position:0%
their commissions and then the Bia is
 
00:22:29.390 --> 00:22:29.400 align:start position:0%
like you know we have to prioritize our
 
00:22:32.029 --> 00:22:32.039 align:start position:0%
lives too and we can't
 
00:22:36.830 --> 00:22:36.840 align:start position:0%
we can't be on 10 commissions let me
 
00:22:39.529 --> 00:22:39.539 align:start position:0%
interject also
 
00:22:42.169 --> 00:22:42.179 align:start position:0%
I'm hearing from the current speaker and
 
00:22:44.690 --> 00:22:44.700 align:start position:0%
the previous speaker that
 
00:22:44.700 --> 00:22:47.990 align:start position:0%
the previous speaker that
unfortunately

00:22:47.990 --> 00:22:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:49.850 --> 00:22:49.860 align:start position:0%
our fellow members
 
00:22:54.049 --> 00:22:54.059 align:start position:0%
will campaign for a study Commission
 
00:22:56.750 --> 00:22:56.760 align:start position:0%
and then when when it gets to the cusp
 
00:22:56.760 --> 00:22:57.470 align:start position:0%
and then when when it gets to the cusp
of

00:22:57.470 --> 00:22:57.480 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:23:00.549 --> 00:23:00.559 align:start position:0%
putting it in place and appointments
 
00:23:03.649 --> 00:23:03.659 align:start position:0%
they say that's great but don't put me
 
00:23:06.169 --> 00:23:06.179 align:start position:0%
on it even when it was there I did put
 
00:23:09.529 --> 00:23:09.539 align:start position:0%
the commission together so I wonder if
 
00:23:13.250 --> 00:23:13.260 align:start position:0%
as a group we might put a rule if you
 
00:23:15.529 --> 00:23:15.539 align:start position:0%
will in effect that say if you're an
 
00:23:17.270 --> 00:23:17.280 align:start position:0%
advocate for a study commission you want
 
00:23:19.789 --> 00:23:19.799 align:start position:0%
it done you've got to serve on it and
 
00:23:22.070 --> 00:23:22.080 align:start position:0%
that might well and I think in as part
 
00:23:23.690 --> 00:23:23.700 align:start position:0%
of our
 
00:23:27.230 --> 00:23:27.240 align:start position:0%
charge we need to think about my my
 
00:23:28.970 --> 00:23:28.980 align:start position:0%
thought is this that we're going to set
 
00:23:31.310 --> 00:23:31.320 align:start position:0%
up some sort of infrastructure
 
00:23:34.310 --> 00:23:34.320 align:start position:0%
that people can always work off of and
 
00:23:36.470 --> 00:23:36.480 align:start position:0%
one of one part of the infrastructure
 
00:23:39.049 --> 00:23:39.059 align:start position:0%
would be if a committee is assessing
 
00:23:41.450 --> 00:23:41.460 align:start position:0%
whether to create a study committee or a
 
00:23:41.460 --> 00:23:42.950 align:start position:0%
whether to create a study committee or a
commission

00:23:42.950 --> 00:23:42.960 align:start position:0%
commission
 
00:23:45.110 --> 00:23:45.120 align:start position:0%
have a conversation with the members of
 
00:23:46.789 --> 00:23:46.799 align:start position:0%
the committee at the time and see who's
 
00:23:48.669 --> 00:23:48.679 align:start position:0%
interested in actually working on it
 
00:23:51.710 --> 00:23:51.720 align:start position:0%
right but there are other things that
 
00:23:55.690 --> 00:23:55.700 align:start position:0%
that could always be part of the
 
00:23:58.370 --> 00:23:58.380 align:start position:0%
analysis like you could provide this to
 
00:24:00.950 --> 00:24:00.960 align:start position:0%
a committee chair or to commuse like is
 
00:24:04.310 --> 00:24:04.320 align:start position:0%
this a subject that is really timely is
 
00:24:06.049 --> 00:24:06.059 align:start position:0%
this something that a study committee
 
00:24:09.169 --> 00:24:09.179 align:start position:0%
can really handle you know
 
00:24:10.970 --> 00:24:10.980 align:start position:0%
is there somebody else that could be
 
00:24:13.850 --> 00:24:13.860 align:start position:0%
studying it or is studying it presently
 
00:24:15.950 --> 00:24:15.960 align:start position:0%
I mean I think there's a whole series of
 
00:24:18.350 --> 00:24:18.360 align:start position:0%
questions if we write them down we could
 
00:24:20.149 --> 00:24:20.159 align:start position:0%
provide them to committee chairs and
 
00:24:22.970 --> 00:24:22.980 align:start position:0%
they could use that as a way of
 
00:24:24.830 --> 00:24:24.840 align:start position:0%
informing whether a study committee
 
00:24:26.870 --> 00:24:26.880 align:start position:0%
could go forward and I don't mean to
 
00:24:29.090 --> 00:24:29.100 align:start position:0%
interrupt that no no it's fine I'm sorry
 
00:24:31.190 --> 00:24:31.200 align:start position:0%
I just have all the stuff in my head and
 
00:24:32.810 --> 00:24:32.820 align:start position:0%
I just want to get it out but I think we
 
00:24:35.630 --> 00:24:35.640 align:start position:0%
need to hear right so
 
00:24:37.909 --> 00:24:37.919 align:start position:0%
I mean actually somebody was asking me
 
00:24:39.710 --> 00:24:39.720 align:start position:0%
today whether a study committee should
 
00:24:43.250 --> 00:24:43.260 align:start position:0%
be formed and I that was what I was I
 
00:24:45.649 --> 00:24:45.659 align:start position:0%
was thinking about all the things that
 
00:24:48.770 --> 00:24:48.780 align:start position:0%
could be asked because part of I mean
 
00:24:51.350 --> 00:24:51.360 align:start position:0%
the the other thing is that
 
00:24:53.390 --> 00:24:53.400 align:start position:0%
study committees do provide an
 
00:24:56.570 --> 00:24:56.580 align:start position:0%
unbelievably useful service and you
 
00:24:59.570 --> 00:24:59.580 align:start position:0%
don't want to be like randomly snuffing
 
00:25:01.130 --> 00:25:01.140 align:start position:0%
them out just because you want to keep
 
00:25:03.710 --> 00:25:03.720 align:start position:0%
the numbers down I mean if it's a really
 
00:25:05.630 --> 00:25:05.640 align:start position:0%
important topic that should be studied
 
00:25:08.210 --> 00:25:08.220 align:start position:0%
and it can be studied in the context of
 
00:25:10.789 --> 00:25:10.799 align:start position:0%
like a six-week period
 
00:25:13.730 --> 00:25:13.740 align:start position:0%
it can be really really good there was
 
00:25:15.950 --> 00:25:15.960 align:start position:0%
there was one I'm sure on another
 
00:25:17.870 --> 00:25:17.880 align:start position:0%
committee that I serve on I serve on the
 
00:25:21.529 --> 00:25:21.539 align:start position:0%
Edna committee and one of the things
 
00:25:24.230 --> 00:25:24.240 align:start position:0%
that we ran into recently this past
 
00:25:26.930 --> 00:25:26.940 align:start position:0%
spring was
 
00:25:30.710 --> 00:25:30.720 align:start position:0%
a a bureau of Bureau of Statistics type
 
00:25:33.230 --> 00:25:33.240 align:start position:0%
of commission said well we need to be
 
00:25:33.240 --> 00:25:34.730 align:start position:0%
of commission said well we need to be
studying

00:25:34.730 --> 00:25:34.740 align:start position:0%
studying
 
00:25:38.149 --> 00:25:38.159 align:start position:0%
how many of this kind of person is
 
00:25:40.730 --> 00:25:40.740 align:start position:0%
participating about this kind of person
 
00:25:43.250 --> 00:25:43.260 align:start position:0%
and this you know these types of
 
00:25:46.669 --> 00:25:46.679 align:start position:0%
Statistics that we need and it came to
 
00:25:50.750 --> 00:25:50.760 align:start position:0%
light that UNH is already doing uh at a
 
00:25:53.269 --> 00:25:53.279 align:start position:0%
very detailed level so why can't we just
 
00:25:56.450 --> 00:25:56.460 align:start position:0%
take advantage of of the statistics that
 
00:25:58.549 --> 00:25:58.559 align:start position:0%
they're creating and not have to
 
00:26:00.710 --> 00:26:00.720 align:start position:0%
duplicate it with another study
 
00:26:02.630 --> 00:26:02.640 align:start position:0%
commission at the state house so we
 
00:26:05.090 --> 00:26:05.100 align:start position:0%
decided to do that and we killed the the
 
00:26:07.070 --> 00:26:07.080 align:start position:0%
uh well and that's the kind of thing now
 
00:26:09.470 --> 00:26:09.480 align:start position:0%
that might not end up on our Excel our
 
00:26:11.690 --> 00:26:11.700 align:start position:0%
Master list but that's the kind of
 
00:26:15.409 --> 00:26:15.419 align:start position:0%
research right I mean conversely you
 
00:26:18.169 --> 00:26:18.179 align:start position:0%
know there are long-standing statutory
 
00:26:21.830 --> 00:26:21.840 align:start position:0%
commissions that have their own
 
00:26:24.649 --> 00:26:24.659 align:start position:0%
um statutory responsibilities and just
 
00:26:27.230 --> 00:26:27.240 align:start position:0%
because they're studying an overall
 
00:26:30.230 --> 00:26:30.240 align:start position:0%
topic that relates to a particular study
 
00:26:32.690 --> 00:26:32.700 align:start position:0%
committee the legislature is suggesting
 
00:26:35.990 --> 00:26:36.000 align:start position:0%
you can't assume that just because the
 
00:26:38.390 --> 00:26:38.400 align:start position:0%
legislature wants it studied that
 
00:26:40.490 --> 00:26:40.500 align:start position:0%
statutory commission is going to jump on
 
00:26:42.649 --> 00:26:42.659 align:start position:0%
the issue and just do it
 
00:26:45.289 --> 00:26:45.299 align:start position:0%
and and we have that's all that's all
 
00:26:47.870 --> 00:26:47.880 align:start position:0%
part of it but I really think as a
 
00:26:49.789 --> 00:26:49.799 align:start position:0%
committee here we could do some really
 
00:26:53.210 --> 00:26:53.220 align:start position:0%
good work on like telling chairs what
 
00:26:54.830 --> 00:26:54.840 align:start position:0%
we're telling committees what they
 
00:26:56.090 --> 00:26:56.100 align:start position:0%
should be assessing when they're
 
00:26:58.330 --> 00:26:58.340 align:start position:0%
deciding if something should go forward
 
00:27:01.669 --> 00:27:01.679 align:start position:0%
and making sure that the Committees have
 
00:27:05.390 --> 00:27:05.400 align:start position:0%
the information on what already exists
 
00:27:08.570 --> 00:27:08.580 align:start position:0%
and that's what has been what had been
 
00:27:10.370 --> 00:27:10.380 align:start position:0%
missing like
 
00:27:14.630 --> 00:27:14.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:17.029 --> 00:27:17.039 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman um
 
00:27:19.070 --> 00:27:19.080 align:start position:0%
representative evil one of the things
 
00:27:21.409 --> 00:27:21.419 align:start position:0%
that we've been talking about is how can
 
00:27:24.830 --> 00:27:24.840 align:start position:0%
we encourage uh standing committees to
 
00:27:27.769 --> 00:27:27.779 align:start position:0%
do some of the research themselves
 
00:27:30.470 --> 00:27:30.480 align:start position:0%
rather than creating a new committee do
 
00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:31.250 align:start position:0%
rather than creating a new committee do
you

00:27:31.250 --> 00:27:31.260 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:27:33.049 --> 00:27:33.059 align:start position:0%
would you imagine as you're providing
 
00:27:35.090 --> 00:27:35.100 align:start position:0%
guidance as we're providing guidance to
 
00:27:36.830 --> 00:27:36.840 align:start position:0%
all the committee chairs that one of the
 
00:27:39.529 --> 00:27:39.539 align:start position:0%
things we're asking as well is is this
 
00:27:40.909 --> 00:27:40.919 align:start position:0%
something that this committee could do
 
00:27:42.830 --> 00:27:42.840 align:start position:0%
either through uh you know a
 
00:27:44.630 --> 00:27:44.640 align:start position:0%
subcommittee or an ad hoc committee or
 
00:27:46.490 --> 00:27:46.500 align:start position:0%
something like that
 
00:27:48.529 --> 00:27:48.539 align:start position:0%
and I think there's a lot of people that
 
00:27:50.510 --> 00:27:50.520 align:start position:0%
want to encourage
 
00:27:52.850 --> 00:27:52.860 align:start position:0%
I don't I mean I think that's great if
 
00:27:55.130 --> 00:27:55.140 align:start position:0%
they'll do it that's part of the that's
 
00:27:57.230 --> 00:27:57.240 align:start position:0%
part of the Char I mean the other thing
 
00:27:59.330 --> 00:27:59.340 align:start position:0%
we had an idea you know when the
 
00:28:01.310 --> 00:28:01.320 align:start position:0%
committee of committees that it actually
 
00:28:03.830 --> 00:28:03.840 align:start position:0%
would be ledge admin that would meet on
 
00:28:06.830 --> 00:28:06.840 align:start position:0%
an ad hoc basis to review existing
 
00:28:09.289 --> 00:28:09.299 align:start position:0%
committee and commissions
 
00:28:12.049 --> 00:28:12.059 align:start position:0%
um but I TR you know we tried to put
 
00:28:16.130 --> 00:28:16.140 align:start position:0%
that through rules and and it got killed
 
00:28:19.430 --> 00:28:19.440 align:start position:0%
and then the other thing that um
 
00:28:23.029 --> 00:28:23.039 align:start position:0%
in I think it was HB 1269 we tried to
 
00:28:25.850 --> 00:28:25.860 align:start position:0%
stud we tried to um establish a
 
00:28:27.950 --> 00:28:27.960 align:start position:0%
committee on committees not unlike this
 
00:28:30.289 --> 00:28:30.299 align:start position:0%
but it would be done on and so it would
 
00:28:32.690 --> 00:28:32.700 align:start position:0%
be a committee that would be reviewing
 
00:28:35.510 --> 00:28:35.520 align:start position:0%
everything that exists like on a very
 
00:28:38.450 --> 00:28:38.460 align:start position:0%
structured ongoing basis because the the
 
00:28:41.690 --> 00:28:41.700 align:start position:0%
problem is if nobody is reviewing what's
 
00:28:44.570 --> 00:28:44.580 align:start position:0%
been going on and what's created 10
 
00:28:46.190 --> 00:28:46.200 align:start position:0%
years can pass and all of a sudden
 
00:28:48.169 --> 00:28:48.179 align:start position:0%
there's so many things everybody's head
 
00:28:50.690 --> 00:28:50.700 align:start position:0%
explodes and then they dig in again and
 
00:28:53.630 --> 00:28:53.640 align:start position:0%
as part of the infrastructure maybe we
 
00:28:55.970 --> 00:28:55.980 align:start position:0%
can create here we want to put together
 
00:28:58.370 --> 00:28:58.380 align:start position:0%
a system where these things are
 
00:29:00.890 --> 00:29:00.900 align:start position:0%
constantly updated and reviewed and
 
00:29:00.900 --> 00:29:01.970 align:start position:0%
constantly updated and reviewed and
assessed

00:29:01.970 --> 00:29:01.980 align:start position:0%
assessed
 
00:29:04.730 --> 00:29:04.740 align:start position:0%
but not by bringing every agency in
 
00:29:06.890 --> 00:29:06.900 align:start position:0%
every other year because it takes them
 
00:29:08.810 --> 00:29:08.820 align:start position:0%
you know forever
 
00:29:11.390 --> 00:29:11.400 align:start position:0%
to come in it's just way too much work
 
00:29:13.730 --> 00:29:13.740 align:start position:0%
anyway sorry to go on and on but that's
 
00:29:16.970 --> 00:29:16.980 align:start position:0%
sort of my idea that's that's a good
 
00:29:19.070 --> 00:29:19.080 align:start position:0%
idea we value that because of the
 
00:29:21.649 --> 00:29:21.659 align:start position:0%
experience you've had or we really
 
00:29:24.409 --> 00:29:24.419 align:start position:0%
really appreciate that and you also have
 
00:29:26.630 --> 00:29:26.640 align:start position:0%
some thoughts that they want to
 
00:29:29.090 --> 00:29:29.100 align:start position:0%
put on the tables before we get
 
00:29:31.730 --> 00:29:31.740 align:start position:0%
uh continue yeah
 
00:29:34.610 --> 00:29:34.620 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I I want to pick
 
00:29:36.769 --> 00:29:36.779 align:start position:0%
up on actually you know it was something
 
00:29:39.470 --> 00:29:39.480 align:start position:0%
that you brought up which was uh you
 
00:29:43.250 --> 00:29:43.260 align:start position:0%
know Edna you know recognizing that UNH
 
00:29:45.110 --> 00:29:45.120 align:start position:0%
is already doing
 
00:29:47.210 --> 00:29:47.220 align:start position:0%
um some of this work around uh
 
00:29:49.010 --> 00:29:49.020 align:start position:0%
demographics and statistics and things
 
00:29:50.510 --> 00:29:50.520 align:start position:0%
like that
 
00:29:52.970 --> 00:29:52.980 align:start position:0%
um I I think the university system is an
 
00:29:54.350 --> 00:29:54.360 align:start position:0%
incredible could be at a really
 
00:29:57.649 --> 00:29:57.659 align:start position:0%
incredible partner uh in doing some of
 
00:29:59.210 --> 00:29:59.220 align:start position:0%
this research supporting study
 
00:30:01.190 --> 00:30:01.200 align:start position:0%
committees and commissions
 
00:30:04.490 --> 00:30:04.500 align:start position:0%
um the commission that I chaired uh
 
00:30:06.649 --> 00:30:06.659 align:start position:0%
during my freshman term we had students
 
00:30:08.690 --> 00:30:08.700 align:start position:0%
from Dartmouth College their school of
 
00:30:10.190 --> 00:30:10.200 align:start position:0%
public policy reach out to ask if they
 
00:30:12.830 --> 00:30:12.840 align:start position:0%
could be helpful and supportive and they
 
00:30:15.470 --> 00:30:15.480 align:start position:0%
um helped design a website helped it
 
00:30:17.389 --> 00:30:17.399 align:start position:0%
helped pull together a bunch of research
 
00:30:20.930 --> 00:30:20.940 align:start position:0%
for us and we I I found it incredibly
 
00:30:20.940 --> 00:30:22.430 align:start position:0%
for us and we I I found it incredibly
beneficial

00:30:22.430 --> 00:30:22.440 align:start position:0%
beneficial
 
00:30:24.830 --> 00:30:24.840 align:start position:0%
um I will say I'm biased as a graduate
 
00:30:27.710 --> 00:30:27.720 align:start position:0%
of the school of public policy at UNH
 
00:30:29.630 --> 00:30:29.640 align:start position:0%
um but know that they're always looking
 
00:30:31.909 --> 00:30:31.919 align:start position:0%
for projects to put students on that
 
00:30:34.250 --> 00:30:34.260 align:start position:0%
aren't just busy work right that could
 
00:30:36.649 --> 00:30:36.659 align:start position:0%
actually be relevant to
 
00:30:39.350 --> 00:30:39.360 align:start position:0%
um you know the future of the state so
 
00:30:41.630 --> 00:30:41.640 align:start position:0%
um you know if it would be helpful to
 
00:30:43.370 --> 00:30:43.380 align:start position:0%
bring in folks from Carson school public
 
00:30:45.049 --> 00:30:45.059 align:start position:0%
policy a UNH or political science
 
00:30:47.870 --> 00:30:47.880 align:start position:0%
departments at Plymouth 13.
 
00:30:51.169 --> 00:30:51.179 align:start position:0%
um you know I think as a as a funding
 
00:30:54.289 --> 00:30:54.299 align:start position:0%
partner for the University system
 
00:30:55.730 --> 00:30:55.740 align:start position:0%
um I don't think we should hesitate to
 
00:30:57.710 --> 00:30:57.720 align:start position:0%
to reach out and figure out if there are
 
00:31:00.110 --> 00:31:00.120 align:start position:0%
ways that we could partner in ways that
 
00:31:02.149 --> 00:31:02.159 align:start position:0%
are mutually beneficial
 
00:31:06.470 --> 00:31:06.480 align:start position:0%
I I just uh but I have by the way uh
 
00:31:09.350 --> 00:31:09.360 align:start position:0%
there's a
 
00:31:11.870 --> 00:31:11.880 align:start position:0%
now I'm going to embarrass myself
 
00:31:13.610 --> 00:31:13.620 align:start position:0%
because I can't remember a last name is
 
00:31:18.350 --> 00:31:18.360 align:start position:0%
is it who is the an adna the uh Abenaki
 
00:31:21.610 --> 00:31:21.620 align:start position:0%
uh woman Shelley yeah
 
00:31:26.450 --> 00:31:26.460 align:start position:0%
I talked to Shelley uh Sherry Sherry I
 
00:31:28.549 --> 00:31:28.559 align:start position:0%
talked to Sherry and uh
 
00:31:32.570 --> 00:31:32.580 align:start position:0%
she was nervous that our activity
 
00:31:35.149 --> 00:31:35.159 align:start position:0%
was going to kill the
 
00:31:38.389 --> 00:31:38.399 align:start position:0%
Commission on
 
00:31:41.750 --> 00:31:41.760 align:start position:0%
on Native Americans
 
00:31:44.029 --> 00:31:44.039 align:start position:0%
and she she plead with me if I could
 
00:31:47.570 --> 00:31:47.580 align:start position:0%
please intervene I said don't worry
 
00:31:49.730 --> 00:31:49.740 align:start position:0%
about that that's not what that's not
 
00:31:52.070 --> 00:31:52.080 align:start position:0%
what we're about to do
 
00:31:56.330 --> 00:31:56.340 align:start position:0%
but there are there are issues like that
 
00:32:00.190 --> 00:32:00.200 align:start position:0%
that some people are are very
 
00:32:03.769 --> 00:32:03.779 align:start position:0%
wedded to often use that term and that
 
00:32:05.990 --> 00:32:06.000 align:start position:0%
find a lot of value
 
00:32:09.049 --> 00:32:09.059 align:start position:0%
in those commissions as standing
 
00:32:10.430 --> 00:32:10.440 align:start position:0%
commissions that probably should never
 
00:32:11.570 --> 00:32:11.580 align:start position:0%
go away
 
00:32:14.389 --> 00:32:14.399 align:start position:0%
because of the of the important work
 
00:32:16.010 --> 00:32:16.020 align:start position:0%
that they do so
 
00:32:18.769 --> 00:32:18.779 align:start position:0%
I think it's part of our activity we
 
00:32:20.630 --> 00:32:20.640 align:start position:0%
ought to try to root those out and make
 
00:32:20.640 --> 00:32:21.710 align:start position:0%
ought to try to root those out and make
just

00:32:21.710 --> 00:32:21.720 align:start position:0%
just
 
00:32:24.110 --> 00:32:24.120 align:start position:0%
you know build a fencer on them if you
 
00:32:26.210 --> 00:32:26.220 align:start position:0%
will to make sure that they that they
 
00:32:28.610 --> 00:32:28.620 align:start position:0%
don't get swept up in some
 
00:32:30.850 --> 00:32:30.860 align:start position:0%
some general
 
00:32:34.010 --> 00:32:34.020 align:start position:0%
cancellation activity that that we might
 
00:32:36.289 --> 00:32:36.299 align:start position:0%
not want to see yes ma'am
 
00:32:39.049 --> 00:32:39.059 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chairman I mean I I at
 
00:32:40.370 --> 00:32:40.380 align:start position:0%
least it sounded like from last week if
 
00:32:42.350 --> 00:32:42.360 align:start position:0%
we were talking about and today some
 
00:32:44.690 --> 00:32:44.700 align:start position:0%
sort of template or flowchart or however
 
00:32:46.370 --> 00:32:46.380 align:start position:0%
imagining it
 
00:32:48.710 --> 00:32:48.720 align:start position:0%
I would hope that that wouldn't if these
 
00:32:49.909 --> 00:32:49.919 align:start position:0%
understanding communities that are
 
00:32:52.730 --> 00:32:52.740 align:start position:0%
meeting and that are hitting Milestones
 
00:32:54.590 --> 00:32:54.600 align:start position:0%
or goals that they've set out or some
 
00:32:55.549 --> 00:32:55.559 align:start position:0%
way that they're able to check those
 
00:32:57.289 --> 00:32:57.299 align:start position:0%
boxes that hopefully we wouldn't
 
00:32:59.210 --> 00:32:59.220 align:start position:0%
they wouldn't get caught up in that room
 
00:33:00.889 --> 00:33:00.899 align:start position:0%
right if the whole idea you would hope
 
00:33:02.450 --> 00:33:02.460 align:start position:0%
so but I know I wonder if I'm trying to
 
00:33:03.769 --> 00:33:03.779 align:start position:0%
imagine what that scenario is where we
 
00:33:05.690 --> 00:33:05.700 align:start position:0%
would somehow cancel well I know I know
 
00:33:07.970 --> 00:33:07.980 align:start position:0%
Vanessa looked at one
 
00:33:07.980 --> 00:33:08.950 align:start position:0%
Vanessa looked at one
um

00:33:08.950 --> 00:33:08.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:11.570 --> 00:33:11.580 align:start position:0%
if I characterize it incorrectly correct
 
00:33:14.870 --> 00:33:14.880 align:start position:0%
me but the head and meant uh in over 10
 
00:33:14.880 --> 00:33:22.370 align:start position:0%
me but the head and meant uh in over 10
years

00:33:22.370 --> 00:33:22.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:24.230 --> 00:33:24.240 align:start position:0%
so and you can't really blame that on
 
00:33:28.490 --> 00:33:28.500 align:start position:0%
kovid uh so is that could that would
 
00:33:29.990 --> 00:33:30.000 align:start position:0%
that be a default candidate I don't even
 
00:33:31.430 --> 00:33:31.440 align:start position:0%
know what the commission is would that
 
00:33:32.810 --> 00:33:32.820 align:start position:0%
be a default candidate to put on the
 
00:33:34.130 --> 00:33:34.140 align:start position:0%
table and say listen you guys haven't
 
00:33:36.950 --> 00:33:36.960 align:start position:0%
met in 11 years because it really makes
 
00:33:38.630 --> 00:33:38.640 align:start position:0%
sense to keep this Commission in place
 
00:33:42.409 --> 00:33:42.419 align:start position:0%
or should it be maybe reformulated or uh
 
00:33:44.870 --> 00:33:44.880 align:start position:0%
given a new birth that seems like a
 
00:33:46.909 --> 00:33:46.919 align:start position:0%
default unless there's a with an appeal
 
00:33:48.470 --> 00:33:48.480 align:start position:0%
process or something if for some reason
 
00:33:50.330 --> 00:33:50.340 align:start position:0%
there's some extenuating circumstances
 
00:33:52.970 --> 00:33:52.980 align:start position:0%
yeah I would I like that idea is that we
 
00:33:54.230 --> 00:33:54.240 align:start position:0%
if we find
 
00:33:56.450 --> 00:33:56.460 align:start position:0%
those types of things and Karen you may
 
00:33:57.649 --> 00:33:57.659 align:start position:0%
have found them too when you were doing
 
00:34:00.950 --> 00:34:00.960 align:start position:0%
your initial research that
 
00:34:04.430 --> 00:34:04.440 align:start position:0%
is a commission that may have been uh
 
00:34:07.070 --> 00:34:07.080 align:start position:0%
you know the Genesis of it may have been
 
00:34:09.829 --> 00:34:09.839 align:start position:0%
well thought out but the execution of it
 
00:34:12.470 --> 00:34:12.480 align:start position:0%
just doesn't fit for some reason we
 
00:34:13.490 --> 00:34:13.500 align:start position:0%
can't get
 
00:34:17.030 --> 00:34:17.040 align:start position:0%
people appointed to it maybe maybe by
 
00:34:17.040 --> 00:34:18.169 align:start position:0%
people appointed to it maybe maybe by
default

00:34:18.169 --> 00:34:18.179 align:start position:0%
default
 
00:34:19.849 --> 00:34:19.859 align:start position:0%
we push those under the table and say
 
00:34:22.190 --> 00:34:22.200 align:start position:0%
these are going away unless somebody
 
00:34:24.349 --> 00:34:24.359 align:start position:0%
the the commission themselves or
 
00:34:26.629 --> 00:34:26.639 align:start position:0%
somebody's got to convince us
 
00:34:29.589 --> 00:34:29.599 align:start position:0%
that it has value and it should continue
 
00:34:32.149 --> 00:34:32.159 align:start position:0%
but just to keep it in
 
00:34:35.089 --> 00:34:35.099 align:start position:0%
I would be my opinion just keep it
 
00:34:37.730 --> 00:34:37.740 align:start position:0%
because it sound it has a neat name or
 
00:34:39.889 --> 00:34:39.899 align:start position:0%
whatever but it doesn't meet and they're
 
00:34:41.750 --> 00:34:41.760 align:start position:0%
not really accomplishing anything to me
 
00:34:44.810 --> 00:34:44.820 align:start position:0%
that's a that just clogs the system of
 
00:34:46.849 --> 00:34:46.859 align:start position:0%
of a potential appointees which we're
 
00:34:49.430 --> 00:34:49.440 align:start position:0%
all we're all a source of that potential
 
00:34:51.530 --> 00:34:51.540 align:start position:0%
point is something that's not going to
 
00:34:53.990 --> 00:34:54.000 align:start position:0%
meet or they or they come to a medium
 
00:34:55.669 --> 00:34:55.679 align:start position:0%
like this and they don't achieve a
 
00:34:56.930 --> 00:34:56.940 align:start position:0%
quorum and they have to go back home
 
00:34:56.940 --> 00:34:58.250 align:start position:0%
quorum and they have to go back home
again

00:34:58.250 --> 00:34:58.260 align:start position:0%
again
 
00:35:01.370 --> 00:35:01.380 align:start position:0%
well I would hope that in the tracking
 
00:35:03.950 --> 00:35:03.960 align:start position:0%
process that that Deborah Childs and the
 
00:35:05.930 --> 00:35:05.940 align:start position:0%
staff have been working on will have a
 
00:35:08.390 --> 00:35:08.400 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet and we'll start being able
 
00:35:11.630 --> 00:35:11.640 align:start position:0%
to track it much more clearly actually I
 
00:35:14.210 --> 00:35:14.220 align:start position:0%
met with um and
 
00:35:18.470 --> 00:35:18.480 align:start position:0%
it's Gerald and and um I what what I'd
 
00:35:20.930 --> 00:35:20.940 align:start position:0%
love to see is have
 
00:35:24.069 --> 00:35:24.079 align:start position:0%
somehow be able to work it through I.T
 
00:35:26.510 --> 00:35:26.520 align:start position:0%
that when these commissions and
 
00:35:28.790 --> 00:35:28.800 align:start position:0%
committees are meeting it somehow could
 
00:35:31.550 --> 00:35:31.560 align:start position:0%
feed into a template so somebody doesn't
 
00:35:34.730 --> 00:35:34.740 align:start position:0%
have to be doing all kinds of work to
 
00:35:36.589 --> 00:35:36.599 align:start position:0%
figure out who's met and who hasn't I
 
00:35:37.970 --> 00:35:37.980 align:start position:0%
mean that was the
 
00:35:41.210 --> 00:35:41.220 align:start position:0%
that was one of the huge amount of work
 
00:35:44.270 --> 00:35:44.280 align:start position:0%
that HCS had to do when when I was
 
00:35:46.130 --> 00:35:46.140 align:start position:0%
working on it they had to reach out to
 
00:35:47.930 --> 00:35:47.940 align:start position:0%
they first had to figure out what all
 
00:35:50.089 --> 00:35:50.099 align:start position:0%
these things were but they had to reach
 
00:35:51.589 --> 00:35:51.599 align:start position:0%
out to everybody and figure out when
 
00:35:53.630 --> 00:35:53.640 align:start position:0%
they'd met yet
 
00:35:55.910 --> 00:35:55.920 align:start position:0%
the other thing though that you run into
 
00:35:59.270 --> 00:35:59.280 align:start position:0%
is that there are a couple of committees
 
00:36:01.370 --> 00:36:01.380 align:start position:0%
and I can't remember the name of them
 
00:36:03.650 --> 00:36:03.660 align:start position:0%
but one I think one of them works on
 
00:36:08.030 --> 00:36:08.040 align:start position:0%
County budgets and it has a
 
00:36:10.670 --> 00:36:10.680 align:start position:0%
um charge but it hadn't met for a long
 
00:36:12.829 --> 00:36:12.839 align:start position:0%
time so we were thinking we'd get rid of
 
00:36:14.990 --> 00:36:15.000 align:start position:0%
it you know based on I mean we always
 
00:36:17.569 --> 00:36:17.579 align:start position:0%
got input from the administrative agency
 
00:36:20.690 --> 00:36:20.700 align:start position:0%
and I think it was HHS came in and said
 
00:36:22.970 --> 00:36:22.980 align:start position:0%
yes we haven't met for a really long
 
00:36:24.890 --> 00:36:24.900 align:start position:0%
time but you've got to understand this
 
00:36:26.690 --> 00:36:26.700 align:start position:0%
this thing has a statutory
 
00:36:28.609 --> 00:36:28.619 align:start position:0%
responsibility that's really important
 
00:36:31.190 --> 00:36:31.200 align:start position:0%
and actually this year we're going to
 
00:36:33.170 --> 00:36:33.180 align:start position:0%
have to go to it and present a bunch of
 
00:36:35.810 --> 00:36:35.820 align:start position:0%
information so we didn't wipe it out
 
00:36:37.910 --> 00:36:37.920 align:start position:0%
it's just really
 
00:36:40.910 --> 00:36:40.920 align:start position:0%
these things just have so many different
 
00:36:44.630 --> 00:36:44.640 align:start position:0%
iterations I have I tend to
 
00:36:46.609 --> 00:36:46.619 align:start position:0%
try to have a simple view of the world
 
00:36:50.089 --> 00:36:50.099 align:start position:0%
and it's always catches me making
 
00:36:52.430 --> 00:36:52.440 align:start position:0%
mistakes along that line but I would
 
00:36:56.030 --> 00:36:56.040 align:start position:0%
think if we had that mapping would have
 
00:36:59.089 --> 00:36:59.099 align:start position:0%
been happen soon and we go we go to
 
00:37:02.569 --> 00:37:02.579 align:start position:0%
committee chair X let me say here are 15
 
00:37:02.579 --> 00:37:04.130 align:start position:0%
committee chair X let me say here are 15
commissions

00:37:04.130 --> 00:37:04.140 align:start position:0%
commissions
 
00:37:07.069 --> 00:37:07.079 align:start position:0%
tell us which ones are are worthwhile
 
00:37:08.950 --> 00:37:08.960 align:start position:0%
keeping and if they come back and say
 
00:37:12.410 --> 00:37:12.420 align:start position:0%
these 12 got to keep these three over
 
00:37:14.569 --> 00:37:14.579 align:start position:0%
here we I think we can get rid of
 
00:37:16.430 --> 00:37:16.440 align:start position:0%
because they don't meet the criteria or
 
00:37:20.270 --> 00:37:20.280 align:start position:0%
whatever we set up to me that that would
 
00:37:21.589 --> 00:37:21.599 align:start position:0%
be invaluable
 
00:37:24.470 --> 00:37:24.480 align:start position:0%
to for us to help make decisions
 
00:37:28.790 --> 00:37:28.800 align:start position:0%
you know for legislation to to kill the
 
00:37:30.370 --> 00:37:30.380 align:start position:0%
commissions or
 
00:37:32.690 --> 00:37:32.700 align:start position:0%
recommendations at least to kill the
 
00:37:34.790 --> 00:37:34.800 align:start position:0%
post so I mean the only thing I would
 
00:37:36.770 --> 00:37:36.780 align:start position:0%
say is that we literally just did this
 
00:37:38.690 --> 00:37:38.700 align:start position:0%
work two years ago yeah
 
00:37:40.609 --> 00:37:40.619 align:start position:0%
I mean we just did it
 
00:37:40.619 --> 00:37:42.230 align:start position:0%
I mean we just did it
so

00:37:42.230 --> 00:37:42.240 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:37:44.210 --> 00:37:44.220 align:start position:0%
I mean
 
00:37:46.250 --> 00:37:46.260 align:start position:0%
folks can do what they want but we just
 
00:37:48.349 --> 00:37:48.359 align:start position:0%
went through this whole thing so I don't
 
00:37:50.690 --> 00:37:50.700 align:start position:0%
think there's going I mean I think doing
 
00:37:52.970 --> 00:37:52.980 align:start position:0%
the staff doing what they're doing if
 
00:37:54.890 --> 00:37:54.900 align:start position:0%
there are a few like two or three out
 
00:37:57.109 --> 00:37:57.119 align:start position:0%
there lurking that they feel like that
 
00:38:00.890 --> 00:38:00.900 align:start position:0%
that it's time then we can do it but
 
00:38:02.930 --> 00:38:02.940 align:start position:0%
um my other
 
00:38:05.990 --> 00:38:06.000 align:start position:0%
what we always felt was that Arch on the
 
00:38:07.730 --> 00:38:07.740 align:start position:0%
community and committees we weren't a
 
00:38:11.750 --> 00:38:11.760 align:start position:0%
substantive group and I we worked really
 
00:38:14.150 --> 00:38:14.160 align:start position:0%
hard not to be making decisions on
 
00:38:16.970 --> 00:38:16.980 align:start position:0%
substantive matters but on the you know
 
00:38:19.430 --> 00:38:19.440 align:start position:0%
the representation of the administrative
 
00:38:22.010 --> 00:38:22.020 align:start position:0%
agency and the chairs or members of the
 
00:38:24.290 --> 00:38:24.300 align:start position:0%
commission to decide whether this had a
 
00:38:26.930 --> 00:38:26.940 align:start position:0%
purpose to fulfill anymore
 
00:38:26.940 --> 00:38:27.710 align:start position:0%
purpose to fulfill anymore
um

00:38:27.710 --> 00:38:27.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:29.750 --> 00:38:29.760 align:start position:0%
and if there was a substantive matter
 
00:38:31.970 --> 00:38:31.980 align:start position:0%
then you know it needed to be taken up
 
00:38:34.250 --> 00:38:34.260 align:start position:0%
by the standing committee I just didn't
 
00:38:37.370 --> 00:38:37.380 align:start position:0%
think that we should be getting involved
 
00:38:39.589 --> 00:38:39.599 align:start position:0%
in substantive matters some of the some
 
00:38:41.930 --> 00:38:41.940 align:start position:0%
of the feedback I've gotten from
 
00:38:43.910 --> 00:38:43.920 align:start position:0%
the speaker and also
 
00:38:47.510 --> 00:38:47.520 align:start position:0%
from the minority leader is that we're
 
00:38:49.849 --> 00:38:49.859 align:start position:0%
out of people we got so many people
 
00:38:53.870 --> 00:38:53.880 align:start position:0%
mapped into so many assignments that it
 
00:38:56.569 --> 00:38:56.579 align:start position:0%
doesn't make sense for us to try to set
 
00:38:58.490 --> 00:38:58.500 align:start position:0%
up a new Commission on
 
00:39:01.730 --> 00:39:01.740 align:start position:0%
on Z over here and populate it with a
 
00:39:03.470 --> 00:39:03.480 align:start position:0%
whole bunch more Representatives
 
00:39:05.510 --> 00:39:05.520 align:start position:0%
because it just there are people that
 
00:39:08.390 --> 00:39:08.400 align:start position:0%
stretch too thin to be able to serve I
 
00:39:11.930 --> 00:39:11.940 align:start position:0%
think we've we found some
 
00:39:14.569 --> 00:39:14.579 align:start position:0%
legislators were serving over a dozen
 
00:39:18.710 --> 00:39:18.720 align:start position:0%
different commissions at a time and they
 
00:39:20.390 --> 00:39:20.400 align:start position:0%
just they don't have the time to meet
 
00:39:22.550 --> 00:39:22.560 align:start position:0%
and so so that we're at a point of
 
00:39:25.130 --> 00:39:25.140 align:start position:0%
diminishing returns and we want to get
 
00:39:26.810 --> 00:39:26.820 align:start position:0%
some feedback or we want to get some
 
00:39:28.910 --> 00:39:28.920 align:start position:0%
goodness out of that commission but if
 
00:39:31.190 --> 00:39:31.200 align:start position:0%
people are too busy because they've got
 
00:39:32.870 --> 00:39:32.880 align:start position:0%
so many assignments
 
00:39:36.250 --> 00:39:36.260 align:start position:0%
and they can't attend the meetings then
 
00:39:38.690 --> 00:39:38.700 align:start position:0%
what's the other thing we try to do is
 
00:39:41.030 --> 00:39:41.040 align:start position:0%
reduce the number of Representatives on
 
00:39:44.089 --> 00:39:44.099 align:start position:0%
any particular Mission we've got some
 
00:39:49.069 --> 00:39:49.079 align:start position:0%
pushback from that button I mean
 
00:39:51.470 --> 00:39:51.480 align:start position:0%
I don't I don't know what you see the
 
00:39:54.050 --> 00:39:54.060 align:start position:0%
next task it's being since we just did
 
00:39:56.210 --> 00:39:56.220 align:start position:0%
this two years ago I wouldn't think that
 
00:39:58.069 --> 00:39:58.079 align:start position:0%
would be the first place that we would
 
00:40:01.730 --> 00:40:01.740 align:start position:0%
dive in we've got September 11th is when
 
00:40:04.430 --> 00:40:04.440 align:start position:0%
filing period comes up again and I feel
 
00:40:06.710 --> 00:40:06.720 align:start position:0%
like if we're going to do some good work
 
00:40:08.870 --> 00:40:08.880 align:start position:0%
here in the next couple of months we
 
00:40:10.910 --> 00:40:10.920 align:start position:0%
should be setting up what we think would
 
00:40:14.089 --> 00:40:14.099 align:start position:0%
be a good template for commissions and
 
00:40:17.150 --> 00:40:17.160 align:start position:0%
committees and have the speaker look at
 
00:40:20.329 --> 00:40:20.339 align:start position:0%
it and get some policies in place so
 
00:40:23.030 --> 00:40:23.040 align:start position:0%
that when members go marching into OLS
 
00:40:25.370 --> 00:40:25.380 align:start position:0%
with a bunch of ideas
 
00:40:28.730 --> 00:40:28.740 align:start position:0%
OLS is empowered to say have you done
 
00:40:30.650 --> 00:40:30.660 align:start position:0%
this have you done this you've got to do
 
00:40:32.930 --> 00:40:32.940 align:start position:0%
this and it's going to stay and and we
 
00:40:36.290 --> 00:40:36.300 align:start position:0%
have a template worked out in advance I
 
00:40:37.670 --> 00:40:37.680 align:start position:0%
mean I think that would be great
 
00:40:40.730 --> 00:40:40.740 align:start position:0%
representative wall had volunteered now
 
00:40:42.950 --> 00:40:42.960 align:start position:0%
that she's not here I can attribute more
 
00:40:45.050 --> 00:40:45.060 align:start position:0%
to her volunteer than maybe she wants
 
00:40:47.690 --> 00:40:47.700 align:start position:0%
but she had volunteered to at least be
 
00:40:51.950 --> 00:40:51.960 align:start position:0%
part of a process to determine the
 
00:40:53.690 --> 00:40:53.700 align:start position:0%
process to determine that what those
 
00:40:55.550 --> 00:40:55.560 align:start position:0%
templates ought to look like
 
00:40:58.370 --> 00:40:58.380 align:start position:0%
that part of our effort
 
00:41:01.370 --> 00:41:01.380 align:start position:0%
ought to be looking at commissions that
 
00:41:04.970 --> 00:41:04.980 align:start position:0%
maybe we want to turn off but also part
 
00:41:07.849 --> 00:41:07.859 align:start position:0%
of the process ought to be developing a
 
00:41:09.530 --> 00:41:09.540 align:start position:0%
tight process around creating
 
00:41:12.890 --> 00:41:12.900 align:start position:0%
commissions and how it
 
00:41:15.109 --> 00:41:15.119 align:start position:0%
would be part of it is to start out with
 
00:41:17.690 --> 00:41:17.700 align:start position:0%
David who was here and telling us what
 
00:41:19.970 --> 00:41:19.980 align:start position:0%
things got for his template now
 
00:41:22.310 --> 00:41:22.320 align:start position:0%
and then have some sort of meeting of
 
00:41:25.130 --> 00:41:25.140 align:start position:0%
the line I mean you know that's all
 
00:41:28.130 --> 00:41:28.140 align:start position:0%
you've got to do but look at how long
 
00:41:30.050 --> 00:41:30.060 align:start position:0%
but it's also going to be something that
 
00:41:33.589 --> 00:41:33.599 align:start position:0%
they can work fast from right
 
00:41:36.890 --> 00:41:36.900 align:start position:0%
and I think right and I think what we
 
00:41:37.849 --> 00:41:37.859 align:start position:0%
can do
 
00:41:41.270 --> 00:41:41.280 align:start position:0%
right some of the some of the uh
 
00:41:41.280 --> 00:41:42.650 align:start position:0%
right some of the some of the uh
uh

00:41:42.650 --> 00:41:42.660 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:41:45.170 --> 00:41:45.180 align:start position:0%
controls can be we can go to the
 
00:41:47.890 --> 00:41:47.900 align:start position:0%
minority leader and the speaker and and
 
00:41:50.510 --> 00:41:50.520 align:start position:0%
say make sure
 
00:41:53.810 --> 00:41:53.820 align:start position:0%
that when a commission comes up that
 
00:41:55.670 --> 00:41:55.680 align:start position:0%
you're that these guys are asking the
 
00:41:55.680 --> 00:41:56.810 align:start position:0%
you're that these guys are asking the
questions

00:41:56.810 --> 00:41:56.820 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:41:59.150 --> 00:41:59.160 align:start position:0%
have you followed the template have do
 
00:42:02.450 --> 00:42:02.460 align:start position:0%
you have you done X Y and Z in order to
 
00:42:06.170 --> 00:42:06.180 align:start position:0%
fulfill the the needs of what a
 
00:42:08.390 --> 00:42:08.400 align:start position:0%
commission is going to gonna and so we
 
00:42:09.710 --> 00:42:09.720 align:start position:0%
look to them
 
00:42:12.530 --> 00:42:12.540 align:start position:0%
to kind of enforce whatever rules that
 
00:42:15.710 --> 00:42:15.720 align:start position:0%
we would put in place
 
00:42:15.720 --> 00:42:17.510 align:start position:0%
we would put in place
power

00:42:17.510 --> 00:42:17.520 align:start position:0%
power
 
00:42:19.849 --> 00:42:19.859 align:start position:0%
off because what happens is
 
00:42:22.069 --> 00:42:22.079 align:start position:0%
you know a member will come in and
 
00:42:24.290 --> 00:42:24.300 align:start position:0%
they'll say all right fine in the Statue
 
00:42:26.569 --> 00:42:26.579 align:start position:0%
here it says 15 members but that's okay
 
00:42:29.210 --> 00:42:29.220 align:start position:0%
because I want 20. I mean and in the end
 
00:42:31.430 --> 00:42:31.440 align:start position:0%
if they win they win and it can be dealt
 
00:42:33.170 --> 00:42:33.180 align:start position:0%
with they get the standing committee
 
00:42:34.930 --> 00:42:34.940 align:start position:0%
level but
 
00:42:38.650 --> 00:42:38.660 align:start position:0%
I mean to me one of the key things is
 
00:42:41.390 --> 00:42:41.400 align:start position:0%
remember have you done the research to
 
00:42:43.130 --> 00:42:43.140 align:start position:0%
know whether or not this has been done
 
00:42:43.140 --> 00:42:44.390 align:start position:0%
know whether or not this has been done
before

00:42:44.390 --> 00:42:44.400 align:start position:0%
before
 
00:42:47.210 --> 00:42:47.220 align:start position:0%
you know and if we have our 10 we can
 
00:42:49.130 --> 00:42:49.140 align:start position:0%
have our Excel spreadsheet up to date
 
00:42:52.010 --> 00:42:52.020 align:start position:0%
then it'll be so much easier for
 
00:42:55.490 --> 00:42:55.500 align:start position:0%
everybody to do that research so to me
 
00:42:57.470 --> 00:42:57.480 align:start position:0%
that would be a really good first step
 
00:42:58.910 --> 00:42:58.920 align:start position:0%
especially because we're leading into
 
00:43:01.010 --> 00:43:01.020 align:start position:0%
another filing period and the other
 
00:43:04.670 --> 00:43:04.680 align:start position:0%
thing is basically uh what shall I say a
 
00:43:09.230 --> 00:43:09.240 align:start position:0%
dialogue or a q a for committees on all
 
00:43:10.730 --> 00:43:10.740 align:start position:0%
the things that they should be looking
 
00:43:13.970 --> 00:43:13.980 align:start position:0%
at and deciding whether to create a
 
00:43:17.690 --> 00:43:17.700 align:start position:0%
statutory commission or a study plan and
 
00:43:19.370 --> 00:43:19.380 align:start position:0%
you you Karen you think it would be
 
00:43:21.589 --> 00:43:21.599 align:start position:0%
useful that once we get this mapping
 
00:43:23.750 --> 00:43:23.760 align:start position:0%
done so that we know that
 
00:43:23.760 --> 00:43:25.490 align:start position:0%
done so that we know that
see

00:43:25.490 --> 00:43:25.500 align:start position:0%
see
 
00:43:27.650 --> 00:43:27.660 align:start position:0%
well I'm just saying if we had if we had
 
00:43:29.270 --> 00:43:29.280 align:start position:0%
a mapping that said
 
00:43:31.490 --> 00:43:31.500 align:start position:0%
uh committee
 
00:43:35.690 --> 00:43:35.700 align:start position:0%
Reggie admin your committee you get the
 
00:43:37.370 --> 00:43:37.380 align:start position:0%
committee chair and perhaps Vice chair
 
00:43:40.250 --> 00:43:40.260 align:start position:0%
in here and say you're you're
 
00:43:43.609 --> 00:43:43.619 align:start position:0%
and you you are empowered to oversee
 
00:43:46.730 --> 00:43:46.740 align:start position:0%
these commissions that are in place
 
00:43:50.270 --> 00:43:50.280 align:start position:0%
supporting leggy admin uh have a have a
 
00:43:52.069 --> 00:43:52.079 align:start position:0%
discussion with them about
 
00:43:54.170 --> 00:43:54.180 align:start position:0%
what we're looking for and what their
 
00:43:57.230 --> 00:43:57.240 align:start position:0%
responsibilities are and and for them to
 
00:43:59.390 --> 00:43:59.400 align:start position:0%
give us feedback as to how well the
 
00:44:01.730 --> 00:44:01.740 align:start position:0%
commission is doing or not they know
 
00:44:03.890 --> 00:44:03.900 align:start position:0%
they may not they may not know and that
 
00:44:06.890 --> 00:44:06.900 align:start position:0%
may be like next year sometime but I
 
00:44:08.630 --> 00:44:08.640 align:start position:0%
think we need to make sure that the
 
00:44:11.450 --> 00:44:11.460 align:start position:0%
staff whatever this temp the Excel
 
00:44:13.670 --> 00:44:13.680 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet is that they're doing that
 
00:44:17.270 --> 00:44:17.280 align:start position:0%
the related standing committee is listed
 
00:44:19.130 --> 00:44:19.140 align:start position:0%
in the column so Brad I don't know if
 
00:44:24.349 --> 00:44:24.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:26.329 --> 00:44:26.339 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean I don't think it's that I
 
00:44:28.370 --> 00:44:28.380 align:start position:0%
feel like we I think we did that because
 
00:44:30.109 --> 00:44:30.119 align:start position:0%
when we were reviewing all the
 
00:44:32.569 --> 00:44:32.579 align:start position:0%
Committees and commissions I was calling
 
00:44:36.589 --> 00:44:36.599 align:start position:0%
chairs to get there to get their input
 
00:44:40.190 --> 00:44:40.200 align:start position:0%
um but I mean I I think over the next
 
00:44:43.010 --> 00:44:43.020 align:start position:0%
few months we should be giving OLS and
 
00:44:46.190 --> 00:44:46.200 align:start position:0%
our members the tools that they need to
 
00:44:49.430 --> 00:44:49.440 align:start position:0%
better Define the process and rein it in
 
00:44:51.109 --> 00:44:51.119 align:start position:0%
and then
 
00:44:53.150 --> 00:44:53.160 align:start position:0%
I just was going to say one of it it's
 
00:44:55.010 --> 00:44:55.020 align:start position:0%
the statutory commissions that are
 
00:44:57.290 --> 00:44:57.300 align:start position:0%
really a big lift
 
00:45:00.470 --> 00:45:00.480 align:start position:0%
and I firmly believe that you can do I
 
00:45:02.030 --> 00:45:02.040 align:start position:0%
know you had a really successful
 
00:45:04.670 --> 00:45:04.680 align:start position:0%
commission but if it's a really targeted
 
00:45:07.069 --> 00:45:07.079 align:start position:0%
issue you really can do some fantastic
 
00:45:09.170 --> 00:45:09.180 align:start position:0%
work just with legislative study
 
00:45:09.180 --> 00:45:10.550 align:start position:0%
work just with legislative study
committees

00:45:10.550 --> 00:45:10.560 align:start position:0%
committees
 
00:45:12.349 --> 00:45:12.359 align:start position:0%
of course it all depends who chairs them
 
00:45:14.089 --> 00:45:14.099 align:start position:0%
I mean and that's why you put the
 
00:45:16.130 --> 00:45:16.140 align:start position:0%
infrastructure in place and then you
 
00:45:18.829 --> 00:45:18.839 align:start position:0%
might have outliers but for the most
 
00:45:23.690 --> 00:45:23.700 align:start position:0%
part things should work pretty easily
 
00:45:26.690 --> 00:45:26.700 align:start position:0%
I think you're right I I
 
00:45:28.970 --> 00:45:28.980 align:start position:0%
my most recent experience with the Edna
 
00:45:33.470 --> 00:45:33.480 align:start position:0%
is that is that the committee chair
 
00:45:35.690 --> 00:45:35.700 align:start position:0%
usually has about four subcommittees
 
00:45:38.990 --> 00:45:39.000 align:start position:0%
always currently operating and when an
 
00:45:40.790 --> 00:45:40.800 align:start position:0%
issue comes up that looks like it needs
 
00:45:43.490 --> 00:45:43.500 align:start position:0%
to be studied well looked into she
 
00:45:46.430 --> 00:45:46.440 align:start position:0%
immediately assigns it to that one of
 
00:45:48.890 --> 00:45:48.900 align:start position:0%
those four study committees and then and
 
00:45:48.900 --> 00:45:50.030 align:start position:0%
those four study committees and then and
waits

00:45:50.030 --> 00:45:50.040 align:start position:0%
waits
 
00:45:52.910 --> 00:45:52.920 align:start position:0%
a month or so for them to come back with
 
00:45:55.430 --> 00:45:55.440 align:start position:0%
feedback to say okay this is what this
 
00:45:57.589 --> 00:45:57.599 align:start position:0%
is what we want to do and
 
00:45:59.930 --> 00:45:59.940 align:start position:0%
we either want to support legislation or
 
00:46:03.170 --> 00:46:03.180 align:start position:0%
kill legislation depending what they can
 
00:46:18.109 --> 00:46:18.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:21.950 --> 00:46:21.960 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah I mean
 
00:46:24.650 --> 00:46:24.660 align:start position:0%
I think Mr Sherman I think what I'm
 
00:46:28.609 --> 00:46:28.619 align:start position:0%
hearing is that a template for future
 
00:46:30.650 --> 00:46:30.660 align:start position:0%
study committees and commissions would
 
00:46:34.010 --> 00:46:34.020 align:start position:0%
be helpful not just for OLS but also for
 
00:46:36.470 --> 00:46:36.480 align:start position:0%
for us for us I mean so there's like
 
00:46:38.990 --> 00:46:39.000 align:start position:0%
member education there's OLS needs to
 
00:46:40.790 --> 00:46:40.800 align:start position:0%
have it to be like are did you go
 
00:46:42.770 --> 00:46:42.780 align:start position:0%
through the the template right did you
 
00:46:44.450 --> 00:46:44.460 align:start position:0%
go through the checklist and answer all
 
00:46:46.609 --> 00:46:46.619 align:start position:0%
these questions and then committee
 
00:46:48.710 --> 00:46:48.720 align:start position:0%
chairs and committees also need to
 
00:46:51.470 --> 00:46:51.480 align:start position:0%
understand what we're expecting moving
 
00:46:53.809 --> 00:46:53.819 align:start position:0%
forward and I think that can be you know
 
00:46:56.030 --> 00:46:56.040 align:start position:0%
I think if we can recommend recommend
 
00:46:57.470 --> 00:46:57.480 align:start position:0%
something to the speaker and then I
 
00:46:58.730 --> 00:46:58.740 align:start position:0%
think the speaker can send it out to
 
00:47:00.230 --> 00:47:00.240 align:start position:0%
members and then that's the expectation
 
00:47:02.690 --> 00:47:02.700 align:start position:0%
so you so in with that that thought in
 
00:47:06.290 --> 00:47:06.300 align:start position:0%
mind do you were you envisioning that
 
00:47:08.750 --> 00:47:08.760 align:start position:0%
either this committee or something like
 
00:47:11.930 --> 00:47:11.940 align:start position:0%
this committee would be a standing
 
00:47:11.940 --> 00:47:13.490 align:start position:0%
this committee would be a standing
uh

00:47:13.490 --> 00:47:13.500 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:47:17.450 --> 00:47:17.460 align:start position:0%
committee that when a new Commission was
 
00:47:19.190 --> 00:47:19.200 align:start position:0%
trying to give birth they would bring it
 
00:47:22.130 --> 00:47:22.140 align:start position:0%
to this committee for approval or
 
00:47:22.140 --> 00:47:23.630 align:start position:0%
to this committee for approval or
no

00:47:23.630 --> 00:47:23.640 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:47:26.390 --> 00:47:26.400 align:start position:0%
no because
 
00:47:29.210 --> 00:47:29.220 align:start position:0%
I just I think that if there's a study
 
00:47:31.550 --> 00:47:31.560 align:start position:0%
committee on a particular subject it's a
 
00:47:34.010 --> 00:47:34.020 align:start position:0%
substantive topic and I think that the
 
00:47:35.990 --> 00:47:36.000 align:start position:0%
topic should be reviewed by the standing
 
00:47:38.630 --> 00:47:38.640 align:start position:0%
committee and not a bunch of people that
 
00:47:40.550 --> 00:47:40.560 align:start position:0%
are on more of a
 
00:47:43.069 --> 00:47:43.079 align:start position:0%
procedural committee but a part of what
 
00:47:45.050 --> 00:47:45.060 align:start position:0%
they're doing is making that every
 
00:47:46.730 --> 00:47:46.740 align:start position:0%
single standing committee is just making
 
00:47:49.609 --> 00:47:49.619 align:start position:0%
sure that that they're doing it in the
 
00:47:51.589 --> 00:47:51.599 align:start position:0%
way that we've outlined right the
 
00:47:54.050 --> 00:47:54.060 align:start position:0%
recommendations that we're making
 
00:47:56.030 --> 00:47:56.040 align:start position:0%
um you know everything from needs a
 
00:47:58.130 --> 00:47:58.140 align:start position:0%
Sunset date or it needs you know certain
 
00:48:00.589 --> 00:48:00.599 align:start position:0%
number of members and I mean all all the
 
00:48:02.510 --> 00:48:02.520 align:start position:0%
things that we're talking about that so
 
00:48:04.130 --> 00:48:04.140 align:start position:0%
I think that's like that's one bucket of
 
00:48:06.230 --> 00:48:06.240 align:start position:0%
work that we're talking about
 
00:48:09.829 --> 00:48:09.839 align:start position:0%
um after hearing you talk about you know
 
00:48:11.990 --> 00:48:12.000 align:start position:0%
you weren't trying to make decisions two
 
00:48:13.910 --> 00:48:13.920 align:start position:0%
years ago or four years ago whatever it
 
00:48:16.730 --> 00:48:16.740 align:start position:0%
was now on uh which
 
00:48:18.710 --> 00:48:18.720 align:start position:0%
committees and commissions we keep in
 
00:48:21.170 --> 00:48:21.180 align:start position:0%
which we would get rid of
 
00:48:24.890 --> 00:48:24.900 align:start position:0%
you just did it so I think
 
00:48:27.470 --> 00:48:27.480 align:start position:0%
I think that
 
00:48:29.630 --> 00:48:29.640 align:start position:0%
there should also be there's a template
 
00:48:31.550 --> 00:48:31.560 align:start position:0%
for future and then there's a template
 
00:48:33.530 --> 00:48:33.540 align:start position:0%
for sort of getting committees and
 
00:48:36.290 --> 00:48:36.300 align:start position:0%
commissions in compliance
 
00:48:39.589 --> 00:48:39.599 align:start position:0%
right it's like report dates like it's
 
00:48:40.970 --> 00:48:40.980 align:start position:0%
it's all the things that are in the
 
00:48:43.250 --> 00:48:43.260 align:start position:0%
template for for new ones it's just
 
00:48:48.970 --> 00:48:48.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:51.950 --> 00:48:51.960 align:start position:0%
and that's a compliance check almost but
 
00:48:54.290 --> 00:48:54.300 align:start position:0%
that that to me is actually that could
 
00:48:56.329 --> 00:48:56.339 align:start position:0%
actually be legislation for next year
 
00:48:59.630 --> 00:48:59.640 align:start position:0%
which is just let's let's update all of
 
00:49:02.270 --> 00:49:02.280 align:start position:0%
them to make sure that they've got
 
00:49:04.690 --> 00:49:04.700 align:start position:0%
they have clear
 
00:49:08.030 --> 00:49:08.040 align:start position:0%
structure or all that and so then when
 
00:49:10.190 --> 00:49:10.200 align:start position:0%
they're not then it's then there's a way
 
00:49:11.690 --> 00:49:11.700 align:start position:0%
to get rid of them
 
00:49:14.089 --> 00:49:14.099 align:start position:0%
so that was the question excuse me yes
 
00:49:15.829 --> 00:49:15.839 align:start position:0%
go ahead there isn't the question to me
 
00:49:18.650 --> 00:49:18.660 align:start position:0%
uh point about whether this
 
00:49:21.710 --> 00:49:21.720 align:start position:0%
this committee continues to exist or if
 
00:49:23.870 --> 00:49:23.880 align:start position:0%
it falls at someone else's
 
00:49:23.880 --> 00:49:25.490 align:start position:0%
it falls at someone else's
Lane

00:49:25.490 --> 00:49:25.500 align:start position:0%
Lane
 
00:49:27.230 --> 00:49:27.240 align:start position:0%
um for existing committees or even going
 
00:49:28.670 --> 00:49:28.680 align:start position:0%
forward new committees that then exist
 
00:49:31.069 --> 00:49:31.079 align:start position:0%
who fail to comply with whatever the
 
00:49:34.970 --> 00:49:34.980 align:start position:0%
template uh boundaries we set forth are
 
00:49:37.849 --> 00:49:37.859 align:start position:0%
um and the default should be that the
 
00:49:40.069 --> 00:49:40.079 align:start position:0%
end if there's an appeal process if
 
00:49:41.750 --> 00:49:41.760 align:start position:0%
there's some sort of
 
00:49:43.250 --> 00:49:43.260 align:start position:0%
um opportunity to say wait actually
 
00:49:44.630 --> 00:49:44.640 align:start position:0%
there's a reason we should be continued
 
00:49:46.370 --> 00:49:46.380 align:start position:0%
to continue we should be allowed to
 
00:49:49.490 --> 00:49:49.500 align:start position:0%
continue who did they come to us do is
 
00:49:52.250 --> 00:49:52.260 align:start position:0%
that alleged admin like
 
00:49:54.530 --> 00:49:54.540 align:start position:0%
okay so right I don't know that how
 
00:49:56.210 --> 00:49:56.220 align:start position:0%
often would happen I mean it seems like
 
00:49:57.710 --> 00:49:57.720 align:start position:0%
we would probably need some sort of
 
00:50:00.410 --> 00:50:00.420 align:start position:0%
standing buddy to take in those kind of
 
00:50:02.030 --> 00:50:02.040 align:start position:0%
but I also think it needs to be a joint
 
00:50:04.430 --> 00:50:04.440 align:start position:0%
committee it should be a house aesthetic
 
00:50:07.130 --> 00:50:07.140 align:start position:0%
because if these are created right if
 
00:50:08.630 --> 00:50:08.640 align:start position:0%
we're creating my statute then it's a
 
00:50:11.930 --> 00:50:11.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:14.450 --> 00:50:14.460 align:start position:0%
because the Senate just sort of does its
 
00:50:16.309 --> 00:50:16.319 align:start position:0%
own thing it could be something that's
 
00:50:18.890 --> 00:50:18.900 align:start position:0%
rolled into another existing commit I
 
00:50:20.690 --> 00:50:20.700 align:start position:0%
mean could be I don't know if facilities
 
00:50:22.910 --> 00:50:22.920 align:start position:0%
it's the right place but like the
 
00:50:25.910 --> 00:50:25.920 align:start position:0%
proposal that we had in the bill that I
 
00:50:29.150 --> 00:50:29.160 align:start position:0%
I put forth that was removed was that we
 
00:50:31.010 --> 00:50:31.020 align:start position:0%
had a joint review
 
00:50:33.770 --> 00:50:33.780 align:start position:0%
a joint committee on communities now the
 
00:50:35.930 --> 00:50:35.940 align:start position:0%
way I had a structures and we're going
 
00:50:37.849 --> 00:50:37.859 align:start position:0%
to bring all the Committees in on sort
 
00:50:41.410 --> 00:50:41.420 align:start position:0%
of a rotating basis like
 
00:50:44.210 --> 00:50:44.220 align:start position:0%
you know like depending on the agency I
 
00:50:46.130 --> 00:50:46.140 align:start position:0%
had it all set out I can say what the
 
00:50:46.140 --> 00:50:47.210 align:start position:0%
had it all set out I can say what the
draft

00:50:47.210 --> 00:50:47.220 align:start position:0%
draft
 
00:50:50.329 --> 00:50:50.339 align:start position:0%
activity here but it was a joint
 
00:50:52.210 --> 00:50:52.220 align:start position:0%
committee and a very clear
 
00:50:55.069 --> 00:50:55.079 align:start position:0%
responsibility I mean because the just
 
00:50:57.290 --> 00:50:57.300 align:start position:0%
habit of expanding as that sort of a
 
00:50:58.670 --> 00:50:58.680 align:start position:0%
joint committee it would just be
 
00:51:01.750 --> 00:51:01.760 align:start position:0%
convened whenever it was felt
 
00:51:06.230 --> 00:51:06.240 align:start position:0%
but I still I I have this hope that if
 
00:51:07.870 --> 00:51:07.880 align:start position:0%
we do our
 
00:51:10.549 --> 00:51:10.559 align:start position:0%
spreadsheets properly and if we can get
 
00:51:13.549 --> 00:51:13.559 align:start position:0%
information fed in from I.T on when
 
00:51:15.530 --> 00:51:15.540 align:start position:0%
they're meeting and stuff like that or
 
00:51:17.690 --> 00:51:17.700 align:start position:0%
if they're fulfilling their reporting
 
00:51:20.390 --> 00:51:20.400 align:start position:0%
requirements the ones that just aren't
 
00:51:22.630 --> 00:51:22.640 align:start position:0%
doing anything will start to rear their
 
00:51:26.390 --> 00:51:26.400 align:start position:0%
heads and it would become you know
 
00:51:29.450 --> 00:51:29.460 align:start position:0%
obvious the ones that I needed rather
 
00:51:36.890 --> 00:51:36.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:39.049 --> 00:51:39.059 align:start position:0%
and then the other pieces that not
 
00:51:41.809 --> 00:51:41.819 align:start position:0%
everything needs to be in a statute I
 
00:51:44.390 --> 00:51:44.400 align:start position:0%
mean you know if we have a policy that's
 
00:51:47.569 --> 00:51:47.579 align:start position:0%
agreed on by the Senate and the house
 
00:51:51.349 --> 00:51:51.359 align:start position:0%
then that would be in place now what um
 
00:51:53.390 --> 00:51:53.400 align:start position:0%
I think some would but I mean there
 
00:51:55.609 --> 00:51:55.619 align:start position:0%
might be things that you know like have
 
00:51:57.530 --> 00:51:57.540 align:start position:0%
you done your research and well Ann
 
00:51:59.930 --> 00:51:59.940 align:start position:0%
Fitzgerald would point it out
 
00:52:02.270 --> 00:52:02.280 align:start position:0%
you missed this part um
 
00:52:05.770 --> 00:52:05.780 align:start position:0%
pointed out in some way of a frustrating
 
00:52:05.780 --> 00:52:07.430 align:start position:0%
pointed out in some way of a frustrating
tone

00:52:07.430 --> 00:52:07.440 align:start position:0%
tone
 
00:52:09.650 --> 00:52:09.660 align:start position:0%
that the Senate
 
00:52:14.170 --> 00:52:14.180 align:start position:0%
which has this language of was it 1449
 
00:52:18.770 --> 00:52:18.780 align:start position:0%
notwithstanding that was that yeah
 
00:52:21.589 --> 00:52:21.599 align:start position:0%
yeah 1449 which is supposed to be a a
 
00:52:21.599 --> 00:52:22.910 align:start position:0%
yeah 1449 which is supposed to be a a
governing

00:52:22.910 --> 00:52:22.920 align:start position:0%
governing
 
00:52:22.920 --> 00:52:24.290 align:start position:0%
governing
uh

00:52:24.290 --> 00:52:24.300 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:52:27.170 --> 00:52:27.180 align:start position:0%
rule uh but they have this language in
 
00:52:29.770 --> 00:52:29.780 align:start position:0%
the Senate they use at 1449
 
00:52:32.270 --> 00:52:32.280 align:start position:0%
notwithstanding so in other words we can
 
00:52:34.250 --> 00:52:34.260 align:start position:0%
do Reddit whatever we want and we're not
 
00:52:37.370 --> 00:52:37.380 align:start position:0%
going to follow that rule well I mean I
 
00:52:39.290 --> 00:52:39.300 align:start position:0%
think that's just a fact whether it says
 
00:52:41.030 --> 00:52:41.040 align:start position:0%
notwithstanding or not I mean the
 
00:52:44.150 --> 00:52:44.160 align:start position:0%
members can do something other than and
 
00:52:47.150 --> 00:52:47.160 align:start position:0%
it does supersede the statute I mean I
 
00:52:49.609 --> 00:52:49.619 align:start position:0%
think one of the big frustrations and I
 
00:52:51.710 --> 00:52:51.720 align:start position:0%
raise this at the first meeting is that
 
00:52:54.170 --> 00:52:54.180 align:start position:0%
if you have a study committee or
 
00:52:57.170 --> 00:52:57.180 align:start position:0%
commission bill that's initiated by a
 
00:53:00.710 --> 00:53:00.720 align:start position:0%
senator and is a Senate bill then that
 
00:53:02.990 --> 00:53:03.000 align:start position:0%
commission should be staffed by the
 
00:53:05.210 --> 00:53:05.220 align:start position:0%
Senate and not always the house right
 
00:53:07.849 --> 00:53:07.859 align:start position:0%
and there was an expectation I think for
 
00:53:10.370 --> 00:53:10.380 align:start position:0%
quite some time that the house committee
 
00:53:12.650 --> 00:53:12.660 align:start position:0%
Services would be the ones that staffed
 
00:53:15.650 --> 00:53:15.660 align:start position:0%
it and I think that's something that has
 
00:53:17.750 --> 00:53:17.760 align:start position:0%
to come from the speaker's office I mean
 
00:53:19.370 --> 00:53:19.380 align:start position:0%
I don't know if you can put that statute
 
00:53:21.890 --> 00:53:21.900 align:start position:0%
or I mean maybe it could but
 
00:53:23.990 --> 00:53:24.000 align:start position:0%
um I I think it's really important
 
00:53:25.730 --> 00:53:25.740 align:start position:0%
because that's part of the problem is
 
00:53:27.950 --> 00:53:27.960 align:start position:0%
house committee Services has so much to
 
00:53:31.849 --> 00:53:31.859 align:start position:0%
do right yes yes I think if there is
 
00:53:34.490 --> 00:53:34.500 align:start position:0%
a template that we decide on and that we
 
00:53:37.549 --> 00:53:37.559 align:start position:0%
want to move forward to the speaker
 
00:53:37.559 --> 00:53:38.930 align:start position:0%
want to move forward to the speaker
um

00:53:38.930 --> 00:53:38.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:40.730 --> 00:53:40.740 align:start position:0%
and then it's disseminated to all
 
00:53:42.650 --> 00:53:42.660 align:start position:0%
members I think I think we should engage
 
00:53:44.930 --> 00:53:44.940 align:start position:0%
with the senate about it too and just be
 
00:53:46.790 --> 00:53:46.800 align:start position:0%
like can we all come to agreement that
 
00:53:49.910 --> 00:53:49.920 align:start position:0%
either this or let's amend this
 
00:53:52.309 --> 00:53:52.319 align:start position:0%
informally you know I mean I mean we
 
00:53:53.329 --> 00:53:53.339 align:start position:0%
should we should have leaders from the
 
00:53:55.309 --> 00:53:55.319 align:start position:0%
Senate come join us and say how does
 
00:53:57.290 --> 00:53:57.300 align:start position:0%
this sound like will you testify
 
00:53:59.510 --> 00:53:59.520 align:start position:0%
certainly favor or against the strap
 
00:54:01.730 --> 00:54:01.740 align:start position:0%
language so that we can tweak it to get
 
00:54:03.410 --> 00:54:03.420 align:start position:0%
it to a spot where we're all comfortable
 
00:54:05.750 --> 00:54:05.760 align:start position:0%
with how we're gonna expect committees
 
00:54:07.390 --> 00:54:07.400 align:start position:0%
and commissions to be
 
00:54:10.430 --> 00:54:10.440 align:start position:0%
designed and implemented yeah and to and
 
00:54:13.130 --> 00:54:13.140 align:start position:0%
the the idea being is to maximize their
 
00:54:13.140 --> 00:54:16.849 align:start position:0%
the the idea being is to maximize their
useful

00:54:16.849 --> 00:54:16.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:19.730 --> 00:54:19.740 align:start position:0%
Ness yeah they get the most out of them
 
00:54:22.010 --> 00:54:22.020 align:start position:0%
that we possibly can for the legislative
 
00:54:22.020 --> 00:54:23.750 align:start position:0%
that we possibly can for the legislative
effort

00:54:23.750 --> 00:54:23.760 align:start position:0%
effort
 
00:54:25.790 --> 00:54:25.800 align:start position:0%
and and
 
00:54:28.809 --> 00:54:28.819 align:start position:0%
as a kind of an asterisk and this is
 
00:54:31.309 --> 00:54:31.319 align:start position:0%
something to follow up with Matt said a
 
00:54:32.750 --> 00:54:32.760 align:start position:0%
couple of meetings ago
 
00:54:34.370 --> 00:54:34.380 align:start position:0%
is that when we have a change in
 
00:54:37.730 --> 00:54:37.740 align:start position:0%
leadership in the house but if we have
 
00:54:40.309 --> 00:54:40.319 align:start position:0%
to make sure that whatever we do is
 
00:54:42.829 --> 00:54:42.839 align:start position:0%
linked so that it doesn't start it
 
00:54:45.589 --> 00:54:45.599 align:start position:0%
doesn't have to start all over again too
 
00:54:47.510 --> 00:54:47.520 align:start position:0%
I mean you've got to have a sustained
 
00:54:47.520 --> 00:54:49.730 align:start position:0%
I mean you've got to have a sustained
process

00:54:49.730 --> 00:54:49.740 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:54:49.740 --> 00:54:53.690 align:start position:0%
process
document

00:54:53.690 --> 00:54:53.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:53.700 --> 00:54:55.130 align:start position:0%
 
welcome

00:54:55.130 --> 00:54:55.140 align:start position:0%
welcome
 
00:54:57.290 --> 00:54:57.300 align:start position:0%
welcome structure
 
00:54:59.510 --> 00:54:59.520 align:start position:0%
and then basically all you've got to do
 
00:55:02.750 --> 00:55:02.760 align:start position:0%
is is which is a huge task let's figure
 
00:55:05.210 --> 00:55:05.220 align:start position:0%
out the good points
 
00:55:08.510 --> 00:55:08.520 align:start position:0%
right which is what's tough
 
00:55:12.109 --> 00:55:12.119 align:start position:0%
right and as I mentioned earlier so many
 
00:55:12.119 --> 00:55:13.069 align:start position:0%
right and as I mentioned earlier so many
folks

00:55:13.069 --> 00:55:13.079 align:start position:0%
folks
 
00:55:14.329 --> 00:55:14.339 align:start position:0%
are so
 
00:55:17.510 --> 00:55:17.520 align:start position:0%
taxed right now that exactly I can't
 
00:55:20.150 --> 00:55:20.160 align:start position:0%
take any more appointments that's why if
 
00:55:21.890 --> 00:55:21.900 align:start position:0%
you have a committing chair in the
 
00:55:23.750 --> 00:55:23.760 align:start position:0%
senate in the house and they say if you
 
00:55:26.210 --> 00:55:26.220 align:start position:0%
want to see with the study committees is
 
00:55:27.890 --> 00:55:27.900 align:start position:0%
something you'd be interested in serving
 
00:55:31.910 --> 00:55:31.920 align:start position:0%
on and just see what they say right and
 
00:55:33.410 --> 00:55:33.420 align:start position:0%
I was asked about it when I brought a
 
00:55:35.750 --> 00:55:35.760 align:start position:0%
study commission forward you know and I
 
00:55:37.490 --> 00:55:37.500 align:start position:0%
thought it was really important that was
 
00:55:39.589 --> 00:55:39.599 align:start position:0%
it was multiple times actually I brought
 
00:55:40.910 --> 00:55:40.920 align:start position:0%
an amendment to turn something into a
 
00:55:42.410 --> 00:55:42.420 align:start position:0%
study committee and the question was
 
00:55:43.910 --> 00:55:43.920 align:start position:0%
would you be willing to serve on this
 
00:55:45.650 --> 00:55:45.660 align:start position:0%
you know and I think it's a good
 
00:55:47.870 --> 00:55:47.880 align:start position:0%
question I mean I think it's a key
 
00:55:50.329 --> 00:55:50.339 align:start position:0%
question I mean the other thing when I
 
00:55:52.370 --> 00:55:52.380 align:start position:0%
was talking about like establishing an
 
00:55:53.870 --> 00:55:53.880 align:start position:0%
infrastructure because you don't know
 
00:55:55.849 --> 00:55:55.859 align:start position:0%
who the people are that are going to be
 
00:55:58.490 --> 00:55:58.500 align:start position:0%
involved and the the other thing that
 
00:56:01.069 --> 00:56:01.079 align:start position:0%
you just you there's no control for it
 
00:56:03.470 --> 00:56:03.480 align:start position:0%
is that if you introduce a study
 
00:56:04.790 --> 00:56:04.800 align:start position:0%
committee bill
 
00:56:07.309 --> 00:56:07.319 align:start position:0%
and usually the way these things work
 
00:56:09.530 --> 00:56:09.540 align:start position:0%
the study committees are set up that the
 
00:56:12.109 --> 00:56:12.119 align:start position:0%
first named member is the sponsor of the
 
00:56:14.030 --> 00:56:14.040 align:start position:0%
bill and they're the convener of the
 
00:56:17.150 --> 00:56:17.160 align:start position:0%
Committees and nine times out of ten
 
00:56:20.750 --> 00:56:20.760 align:start position:0%
they will end up being the chair but you
 
00:56:23.569 --> 00:56:23.579 align:start position:0%
don't know that just because you thought
 
00:56:25.490 --> 00:56:25.500 align:start position:0%
it was a good idea to have a study
 
00:56:27.109 --> 00:56:27.119 align:start position:0%
committee and you're the first named
 
00:56:30.470 --> 00:56:30.480 align:start position:0%
member and you're the chair that this
 
00:56:32.990 --> 00:56:33.000 align:start position:0%
person will know anything about how to
 
00:56:35.210 --> 00:56:35.220 align:start position:0%
run a study commitment
 
00:56:37.549 --> 00:56:37.559 align:start position:0%
right and won't and what you know some
 
00:56:39.349 --> 00:56:39.359 align:start position:0%
people are far more organized than
 
00:56:41.089 --> 00:56:41.099 align:start position:0%
others and there's just all these
 
00:56:43.670 --> 00:56:43.680 align:start position:0%
variables with the individual but that's
 
00:56:46.510 --> 00:56:46.520 align:start position:0%
another thing I guess in my
 
00:56:49.430 --> 00:56:49.440 align:start position:0%
monologue I didn't mention but the other
 
00:56:52.370 --> 00:56:52.380 align:start position:0%
thing that I know HCS has worked on is
 
00:56:55.730 --> 00:56:55.740 align:start position:0%
to very clearly show if you're the head
 
00:56:57.470 --> 00:56:57.480 align:start position:0%
of a study committee or a commission
 
00:56:59.450 --> 00:56:59.460 align:start position:0%
these are the steps that you need to
 
00:56:59.460 --> 00:57:00.410 align:start position:0%
these are the steps that you need to
take

00:57:00.410 --> 00:57:00.420 align:start position:0%
take
 
00:57:02.930 --> 00:57:02.940 align:start position:0%
and you're not going to expect the
 
00:57:06.410 --> 00:57:06.420 align:start position:0%
committee Services people to do all the
 
00:57:08.329 --> 00:57:08.339 align:start position:0%
work for you and run down the
 
00:57:10.309 --> 00:57:10.319 align:start position:0%
appointments and everything and I think
 
00:57:12.710 --> 00:57:12.720 align:start position:0%
the committee chairs can help do some
 
00:57:12.720 --> 00:57:14.170 align:start position:0%
the committee chairs can help do some
screening

00:57:14.170 --> 00:57:14.180 align:start position:0%
screening
 
00:57:17.089 --> 00:57:17.099 align:start position:0%
along the lines I've I have personally
 
00:57:19.010 --> 00:57:19.020 align:start position:0%
seen and I won't get into too many
 
00:57:22.390 --> 00:57:22.400 align:start position:0%
details but I've personally seen
 
00:57:26.150 --> 00:57:26.160 align:start position:0%
ideas be put forward forward for a
 
00:57:28.430 --> 00:57:28.440 align:start position:0%
commission or a committee
 
00:57:28.440 --> 00:57:31.490 align:start position:0%
commission or a committee
whereby

00:57:31.490 --> 00:57:31.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:31.500 --> 00:57:32.470 align:start position:0%
 
uh

00:57:32.470 --> 00:57:32.480 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:57:36.349 --> 00:57:36.359 align:start position:0%
a legislator has made a commitment to
 
00:57:39.049 --> 00:57:39.059 align:start position:0%
a constituent
 
00:57:42.109 --> 00:57:42.119 align:start position:0%
that says uh well
 
00:57:44.390 --> 00:57:44.400 align:start position:0%
I don't know much about this I hear what
 
00:57:46.670 --> 00:57:46.680 align:start position:0%
you're saying uh we'll we'll put we'll
 
00:57:46.680 --> 00:57:47.990 align:start position:0%
you're saying uh we'll we'll put we'll
study

00:57:47.990 --> 00:57:48.000 align:start position:0%
study
 
00:57:49.790 --> 00:57:49.800 align:start position:0%
and that's kind of a way to get it off
 
00:57:51.589 --> 00:57:51.599 align:start position:0%
his or her plate
 
00:57:54.170 --> 00:57:54.180 align:start position:0%
and study and say you've you've met the
 
00:57:56.750 --> 00:57:56.760 align:start position:0%
at least the initial request of the
 
00:57:56.760 --> 00:57:58.069 align:start position:0%
at least the initial request of the
constituent

00:57:58.069 --> 00:57:58.079 align:start position:0%
constituent
 
00:58:00.970 --> 00:58:00.980 align:start position:0%
but there isn't really a real interest
 
00:58:03.650 --> 00:58:03.660 align:start position:0%
in that committee everyone shouldn't go
 
00:58:05.809 --> 00:58:05.819 align:start position:0%
forward if you give X number of
 
00:58:08.870 --> 00:58:08.880 align:start position:0%
questions and sort and and inquiries so
 
00:58:11.089 --> 00:58:11.099 align:start position:0%
I'm just saying that this this screening
 
00:58:12.890 --> 00:58:12.900 align:start position:0%
process that we put in place or this
 
00:58:15.170 --> 00:58:15.180 align:start position:0%
template should hopefully be able to
 
00:58:18.349 --> 00:58:18.359 align:start position:0%
root some of that out uh because where
 
00:58:20.930 --> 00:58:20.940 align:start position:0%
there is some slang that one way to
 
00:58:23.390 --> 00:58:23.400 align:start position:0%
to kill a committee a commission is to
 
00:58:25.849 --> 00:58:25.859 align:start position:0%
study it you know death by death death
 
00:58:27.609 --> 00:58:27.619 align:start position:0%
by study or whatever
 
00:58:30.410 --> 00:58:30.420 align:start position:0%
and and that just I think that just
 
00:58:33.470 --> 00:58:33.480 align:start position:0%
clogs the right clogs the veins the
 
00:58:35.569 --> 00:58:35.579 align:start position:0%
other thing that happens is you have a
 
00:58:38.690 --> 00:58:38.700 align:start position:0%
contentious bill on a certain issue
 
00:58:41.210 --> 00:58:41.220 align:start position:0%
right and the way people sort of figure
 
00:58:43.370 --> 00:58:43.380 align:start position:0%
it out is to create a study committee to
 
00:58:45.829 --> 00:58:45.839 align:start position:0%
study it I mean sometimes that's valid
 
00:58:47.510 --> 00:58:47.520 align:start position:0%
and sometimes it's not and all you can
 
00:58:49.490 --> 00:58:49.500 align:start position:0%
do is really rely on right here it's
 
00:58:51.230 --> 00:58:51.240 align:start position:0%
it's a prevention way to keep it from
 
00:58:53.809 --> 00:58:53.819 align:start position:0%
dying right in some cases but sometimes
 
00:58:55.910 --> 00:58:55.920 align:start position:0%
it's a valid thing I mean this is the
 
00:58:58.010 --> 00:58:58.020 align:start position:0%
this is the challenge to try to make
 
00:59:01.190 --> 00:59:01.200 align:start position:0%
sure that they're well run
 
00:59:03.650 --> 00:59:03.660 align:start position:0%
and we don't create too many but also
 
00:59:06.049 --> 00:59:06.059 align:start position:0%
not to Snuff out ones that are really
 
00:59:08.510 --> 00:59:08.520 align:start position:0%
useful and needed just because we don't
 
00:59:11.450 --> 00:59:11.460 align:start position:0%
want to have so many study committees
 
00:59:11.460 --> 00:59:12.230 align:start position:0%
want to have so many study committees
um

00:59:12.230 --> 00:59:12.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:13.849 --> 00:59:13.859 align:start position:0%
so but
 
00:59:16.370 --> 00:59:16.380 align:start position:0%
I think that from a staff standpoint it
 
00:59:18.890 --> 00:59:18.900 align:start position:0%
would also be really good to have some
 
00:59:21.410 --> 00:59:21.420 align:start position:0%
very clear instructions on if you're
 
00:59:23.150 --> 00:59:23.160 align:start position:0%
going to be running these things how it
 
00:59:25.730 --> 00:59:25.740 align:start position:0%
operates and who's to respond and who's
 
00:59:28.670 --> 00:59:28.680 align:start position:0%
responsible for what and I know uh they
 
00:59:31.190 --> 00:59:31.200 align:start position:0%
they have worked on this let me let me
 
00:59:33.410 --> 00:59:33.420 align:start position:0%
throw this out there just just so I can
 
00:59:37.069 --> 00:59:37.079 align:start position:0%
say I did it what do you think about
 
00:59:40.730 --> 00:59:40.740 align:start position:0%
and someone brought up a thought uh
 
00:59:42.650 --> 00:59:42.660 align:start position:0%
that we should have a
 
00:59:45.829 --> 00:59:45.839 align:start position:0%
a finite number of commissions
 
00:59:50.030 --> 00:59:50.040 align:start position:0%
and if we're going to add Commission
 
00:59:50.040 --> 00:59:51.589 align:start position:0%
and if we're going to add Commission
C

00:59:51.589 --> 00:59:51.599 align:start position:0%
C
 
00:59:53.390 --> 00:59:53.400 align:start position:0%
and we get a Kill
 
00:59:55.490 --> 00:59:55.500 align:start position:0%
one to make room for it
 
00:59:58.190 --> 00:59:58.200 align:start position:0%
and that makes room that
 
00:59:58.200 --> 01:00:00.230 align:start position:0%
and that makes room that
theoretically

01:00:00.230 --> 01:00:00.240 align:start position:0%
theoretically
 
01:00:02.270 --> 01:00:02.280 align:start position:0%
creates more opportunities for
 
01:00:04.250 --> 01:00:04.260 align:start position:0%
legislators to be on commissions because
 
01:00:06.349 --> 01:00:06.359 align:start position:0%
there'll be less commissions or there
 
01:00:08.690 --> 01:00:08.700 align:start position:0%
may be one that they were on is now
 
01:00:11.089 --> 01:00:11.099 align:start position:0%
now killed what do you what do you think
 
01:00:13.490 --> 01:00:13.500 align:start position:0%
about that idea I think it's going to
 
01:00:15.910 --> 01:00:15.920 align:start position:0%
hit groups of people against each other
 
01:00:18.170 --> 01:00:18.180 align:start position:0%
unnecessarily and I just I don't think
 
01:00:20.809 --> 01:00:20.819 align:start position:0%
that you know a studied Commission on
 
01:00:24.109 --> 01:00:24.119 align:start position:0%
Solid Waste going up against uh study
 
01:00:26.930 --> 01:00:26.940 align:start position:0%
Commission on future of Education
 
01:00:30.170 --> 01:00:30.180 align:start position:0%
funding you need to mix I I think it's a
 
01:00:33.049 --> 01:00:33.059 align:start position:0%
bad idea I think you everybody think
 
01:00:34.370 --> 01:00:34.380 align:start position:0%
that I just wanted to get that because
 
01:00:37.370 --> 01:00:37.380 align:start position:0%
that's been suggested so I'll say at
 
01:00:39.109 --> 01:00:39.119 align:start position:0%
least we talked about it and decided not
 
01:00:42.890 --> 01:00:42.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:45.710 --> 01:00:45.720 align:start position:0%
I mean I I wouldn't want to be the one
 
01:00:47.510 --> 01:00:47.520 align:start position:0%
to say that a commission that was doing
 
01:00:50.329 --> 01:00:50.339 align:start position:0%
really good work should be snapped and
 
01:00:51.650 --> 01:00:51.660 align:start position:0%
you're right I mean how do you pick
 
01:00:53.990 --> 01:00:54.000 align:start position:0%
between topics what what
 
01:00:56.210 --> 01:00:56.220 align:start position:0%
um Matt just said
 
01:00:58.250 --> 01:00:58.260 align:start position:0%
and I think if the concern is not having
 
01:01:00.770 --> 01:01:00.780 align:start position:0%
enough legislators to sit on these
 
01:01:00.780 --> 01:01:02.870 align:start position:0%
enough legislators to sit on these
committees

01:01:02.870 --> 01:01:02.880 align:start position:0%
committees
 
01:01:04.910 --> 01:01:04.920 align:start position:0%
that should resolve itself in the sense
 
01:01:05.990 --> 01:01:06.000 align:start position:0%
that like if they can't get enough
 
01:01:07.789 --> 01:01:07.799 align:start position:0%
people not enough people are willing or
 
01:01:09.950 --> 01:01:09.960 align:start position:0%
able to volunteer to sit on them and
 
01:01:12.230 --> 01:01:12.240 align:start position:0%
they're not able to you know to meet or
 
01:01:15.470 --> 01:01:15.480 align:start position:0%
fulfill their requirements and it'll you
 
01:01:16.609 --> 01:01:16.619 align:start position:0%
know it'll cease to exist whatever
 
01:01:18.890 --> 01:01:18.900 align:start position:0%
Sunset State we put into place it does
 
01:01:21.650 --> 01:01:21.660 align:start position:0%
seem like heading up a set number I get
 
01:01:23.150 --> 01:01:23.160 align:start position:0%
the idea of trying to limit people's
 
01:01:25.849 --> 01:01:25.859 align:start position:0%
commitments we have a five-year repeal
 
01:01:28.549 --> 01:01:28.559 align:start position:0%
date now in and that ought to help
 
01:01:29.569 --> 01:01:29.579 align:start position:0%
um and if you don't have enough people
 
01:01:34.210 --> 01:01:34.220 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:38.089 --> 01:01:38.099 align:start position:0%
so what if the speaker
 
01:01:40.789 --> 01:01:40.799 align:start position:0%
uh if if he's responsible or he or she
 
01:01:42.710 --> 01:01:42.720 align:start position:0%
is responsible for making the
 
01:01:43.849 --> 01:01:43.859 align:start position:0%
appointments and
 
01:01:45.530 --> 01:01:45.540 align:start position:0%
can't find
 
01:01:48.289 --> 01:01:48.299 align:start position:0%
enough people is it is it now the
 
01:01:48.299 --> 01:01:49.730 align:start position:0%
enough people is it is it now the
responsibility

01:01:49.730 --> 01:01:49.740 align:start position:0%
responsibility
 
01:01:51.650 --> 01:01:51.660 align:start position:0%
of the speaker's office to bring that
 
01:01:53.809 --> 01:01:53.819 align:start position:0%
back to the to the
 
01:01:55.670 --> 01:01:55.680 align:start position:0%
floor to say we did we couldn't get
 
01:01:57.289 --> 01:01:57.299 align:start position:0%
enough Representatives so now there's an
 
01:02:00.710 --> 01:02:00.720 align:start position:0%
action here to repeal this commission or
 
01:02:05.329 --> 01:02:05.339 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:07.970 --> 01:02:07.980 align:start position:0%
I think maybe we could talk about a
 
01:02:10.250 --> 01:02:10.260 align:start position:0%
process of how to find people because
 
01:02:12.049 --> 01:02:12.059 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure
 
01:02:14.210 --> 01:02:14.220 align:start position:0%
um we necessarily
 
01:02:16.250 --> 01:02:16.260 align:start position:0%
like that might be something that the
 
01:02:17.809 --> 01:02:17.819 align:start position:0%
chairs and the ranking members of the
 
01:02:20.630 --> 01:02:20.640 align:start position:0%
Committees kind of talk about and
 
01:02:20.640 --> 01:02:21.410 align:start position:0%
Committees kind of talk about and
um

01:02:21.410 --> 01:02:21.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:02:24.589 --> 01:02:24.599 align:start position:0%
because I feel like my experiences there
 
01:02:26.329 --> 01:02:26.339 align:start position:0%
are often people out there who are
 
01:02:28.010 --> 01:02:28.020 align:start position:0%
looking for something new and
 
01:02:29.870 --> 01:02:29.880 align:start position:0%
interesting to do but maybe wouldn't be
 
01:02:32.270 --> 01:02:32.280 align:start position:0%
the first people you would think of to
 
01:02:35.990 --> 01:02:36.000 align:start position:0%
do a particular thing so I think maybe
 
01:02:38.030 --> 01:02:38.040 align:start position:0%
part of the problem is there's so much
 
01:02:40.670 --> 01:02:40.680 align:start position:0%
work on the speaker's office to do this
 
01:02:43.130 --> 01:02:43.140 align:start position:0%
work of appointing that maybe that work
 
01:02:45.970 --> 01:02:45.980 align:start position:0%
should be spread a little bit beyond
 
01:02:48.289 --> 01:02:48.299 align:start position:0%
just the folks who are working so hard
 
01:02:49.970 --> 01:02:49.980 align:start position:0%
on it in the speaker's office because
 
01:02:53.569 --> 01:02:53.579 align:start position:0%
they have so much else going on as well
 
01:02:56.990 --> 01:02:57.000 align:start position:0%
yeah Karen well I can tell you as Deputy
 
01:03:00.230 --> 01:03:00.240 align:start position:0%
speaker when I was the person that did
 
01:03:02.930 --> 01:03:02.940 align:start position:0%
worked on the appointments
 
01:03:05.870 --> 01:03:05.880 align:start position:0%
so just as a preliminary yes the the
 
01:03:08.030 --> 01:03:08.040 align:start position:0%
timing of the appointments is really
 
01:03:10.430 --> 01:03:10.440 align:start position:0%
hard because you just take over the
 
01:03:12.829 --> 01:03:12.839 align:start position:0%
speakership or whatever and you're
 
01:03:15.289 --> 01:03:15.299 align:start position:0%
dealing with you know Bill referrals and
 
01:03:17.150 --> 01:03:17.160 align:start position:0%
standing committee appointments and
 
01:03:19.730 --> 01:03:19.740 align:start position:0%
seating and parking and and then you
 
01:03:21.589 --> 01:03:21.599 align:start position:0%
have like two or three hundred people
 
01:03:23.270 --> 01:03:23.280 align:start position:0%
you've got to appoint all these
 
01:03:24.770 --> 01:03:24.780 align:start position:0%
committing commissions
 
01:03:27.890 --> 01:03:27.900 align:start position:0%
so what I I mean what I did as a matter
 
01:03:30.109 --> 01:03:30.119 align:start position:0%
of course and again if we have our Excel
 
01:03:32.870 --> 01:03:32.880 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet with our committees listed I
 
01:03:35.569 --> 01:03:35.579 align:start position:0%
did reach out to committee chairs and I
 
01:03:39.410 --> 01:03:39.420 align:start position:0%
asked for their input on minority and um
 
01:03:42.109 --> 01:03:42.119 align:start position:0%
and majority you know potential
 
01:03:44.870 --> 01:03:44.880 align:start position:0%
appointees and then you know the other
 
01:03:47.329 --> 01:03:47.339 align:start position:0%
thing that you find by the way we can
 
01:03:49.010 --> 01:03:49.020 align:start position:0%
think about this is all of these
 
01:03:50.569 --> 01:03:50.579 align:start position:0%
commissions some of them say you have to
 
01:03:52.730 --> 01:03:52.740 align:start position:0%
have a minority appointee some of them
 
01:03:55.370 --> 01:03:55.380 align:start position:0%
don't say that you know some of them say
 
01:03:57.650 --> 01:03:57.660 align:start position:0%
you have to have somebody from X Y and Z
 
01:04:00.710 --> 01:04:00.720 align:start position:0%
committee some of them are I mean it's
 
01:04:02.930 --> 01:04:02.940 align:start position:0%
it's a community geography oh my God
 
01:04:05.329 --> 01:04:05.339 align:start position:0%
it's just a really confusing uh process
 
01:04:07.609 --> 01:04:07.619 align:start position:0%
and then a lot of times the speaker
 
01:04:09.770 --> 01:04:09.780 align:start position:0%
isn't just responsible for legislative
 
01:04:11.990 --> 01:04:12.000 align:start position:0%
appointments they're responsible for I
 
01:04:14.630 --> 01:04:14.640 align:start position:0%
don't know somebody from UNH so it it
 
01:04:18.109 --> 01:04:18.119 align:start position:0%
gets really um confusing but I think if
 
01:04:21.230 --> 01:04:21.240 align:start position:0%
we're working out a structure again A
 
01:04:23.569 --> 01:04:23.579 align:start position:0%
lot of times sorry to say it just is the
 
01:04:25.430 --> 01:04:25.440 align:start position:0%
truth when you have a change of the
 
01:04:27.890 --> 01:04:27.900 align:start position:0%
guards speaker to speaker there's not
 
01:04:27.900 --> 01:04:29.230 align:start position:0%
guards speaker to speaker there's not
there's

01:04:29.230 --> 01:04:29.240 align:start position:0%
there's
 
01:04:32.150 --> 01:04:32.160 align:start position:0%
not great communication between the two
 
01:04:34.069 --> 01:04:34.079 align:start position:0%
because it's kind of a contentious and
 
01:04:35.690 --> 01:04:35.700 align:start position:0%
sometimes the policies that are put in
 
01:04:37.789 --> 01:04:37.799 align:start position:0%
place by one speaker don't carry over to
 
01:04:40.609 --> 01:04:40.619 align:start position:0%
the other one so one of the things we
 
01:04:43.010 --> 01:04:43.020 align:start position:0%
could do is maybe helps me smooth those
 
01:04:45.589 --> 01:04:45.599 align:start position:0%
Waters to try to get it what was your
 
01:04:48.710 --> 01:04:48.720 align:start position:0%
experience with uh interaction with the
 
01:04:51.849 --> 01:04:51.859 align:start position:0%
executive I mean commit commissions that
 
01:04:54.289 --> 01:04:54.299 align:start position:0%
populated by the governor that's a whole
 
01:04:56.270 --> 01:04:56.280 align:start position:0%
other issue
 
01:04:58.549 --> 01:04:58.559 align:start position:0%
but what I was going to say is
 
01:05:01.730 --> 01:05:01.740 align:start position:0%
in many cases what we did well the other
 
01:05:04.789 --> 01:05:04.799 align:start position:0%
thing I want to say is frequently nobody
 
01:05:06.890 --> 01:05:06.900 align:start position:0%
will step forward and say that they want
 
01:05:08.870 --> 01:05:08.880 align:start position:0%
to work on a commissioner you might have
 
01:05:11.390 --> 01:05:11.400 align:start position:0%
a few and then if you have some you
 
01:05:13.910 --> 01:05:13.920 align:start position:0%
might have 10 people really interested
 
01:05:16.789 --> 01:05:16.799 align:start position:0%
in one Hot Topic and nobody else
 
01:05:19.549 --> 01:05:19.559 align:start position:0%
and what I honestly what I ended up
 
01:05:22.670 --> 01:05:22.680 align:start position:0%
doing what we ended up doing is that we
 
01:05:25.370 --> 01:05:25.380 align:start position:0%
got the input of various parties on a
 
01:05:27.049 --> 01:05:27.059 align:start position:0%
particular appointment we just send out
 
01:05:28.730 --> 01:05:28.740 align:start position:0%
the appointment letter
 
01:05:31.549 --> 01:05:31.559 align:start position:0%
I didn't go we we couldn't like call
 
01:05:34.130 --> 01:05:34.140 align:start position:0%
every person 200 people and say will you
 
01:05:35.750 --> 01:05:35.760 align:start position:0%
do this will you do this will you do
 
01:05:37.849 --> 01:05:37.859 align:start position:0%
this we sent out the appointment letter
 
01:05:39.829 --> 01:05:39.839 align:start position:0%
and if there was somebody that didn't
 
01:05:42.589 --> 01:05:42.599 align:start position:0%
want to do it then we heard back from
 
01:05:45.289 --> 01:05:45.299 align:start position:0%
them it's almost the only way you can do
 
01:05:47.510 --> 01:05:47.520 align:start position:0%
it because if you're trying to find 250
 
01:05:50.030 --> 01:05:50.040 align:start position:0%
people to fill these slots on top of
 
01:05:51.530 --> 01:05:51.540 align:start position:0%
everything you're else you're doing in
 
01:05:53.630 --> 01:05:53.640 align:start position:0%
the first two or three months it's
 
01:05:57.770 --> 01:05:57.780 align:start position:0%
almost an impossible uh task we can talk
 
01:05:59.510 --> 01:05:59.520 align:start position:0%
about the governor's office
 
01:05:59.520 --> 01:06:00.589 align:start position:0%
about the governor's office
two

01:06:00.589 --> 01:06:00.599 align:start position:0%
two
 
01:06:02.750 --> 01:06:02.760 align:start position:0%
I just made me think of something that
 
01:06:03.890 --> 01:06:03.900 align:start position:0%
came up with me in our first meeting
 
01:06:05.089 --> 01:06:05.099 align:start position:0%
where we
 
01:06:07.010 --> 01:06:07.020 align:start position:0%
to me there does seem to be some benefit
 
01:06:09.530 --> 01:06:09.540 align:start position:0%
of like setting expectations that every
 
01:06:12.410 --> 01:06:12.420 align:start position:0%
legislator will be asked to sit on the
 
01:06:13.849 --> 01:06:13.859 align:start position:0%
committee potentially and that that
 
01:06:15.410 --> 01:06:15.420 align:start position:0%
would be the doesn't mean everybody can
 
01:06:16.970 --> 01:06:16.980 align:start position:0%
do it and there will be exceptions I
 
01:06:19.069 --> 01:06:19.079 align:start position:0%
understand that but if that's sort of
 
01:06:20.569 --> 01:06:20.579 align:start position:0%
the level of set expectation and then
 
01:06:22.370 --> 01:06:22.380 align:start position:0%
you get appointed to something I just
 
01:06:23.750 --> 01:06:23.760 align:start position:0%
think that would help spread some of the
 
01:06:25.609 --> 01:06:25.619 align:start position:0%
responsibility I suspected would also
 
01:06:27.710 --> 01:06:27.720 align:start position:0%
build some better you know
 
01:06:29.450 --> 01:06:29.460 align:start position:0%
um ties between legislative you know
 
01:06:30.589 --> 01:06:30.599 align:start position:0%
that everybody's sharing and some of
 
01:06:31.970 --> 01:06:31.980 align:start position:0%
that responsibility and understanding
 
01:06:34.250 --> 01:06:34.260 align:start position:0%
what that work looks like
 
01:06:36.410 --> 01:06:36.420 align:start position:0%
if you come in as a new legislator you
 
01:06:37.849 --> 01:06:37.859 align:start position:0%
know that's just you're on a committee
 
01:06:40.130 --> 01:06:40.140 align:start position:0%
and you're maybe you're on a standing
 
01:06:42.230 --> 01:06:42.240 align:start position:0%
a substantive committee and then you may
 
01:06:44.329 --> 01:06:44.339 align:start position:0%
be appointed to or likely will be
 
01:06:46.190 --> 01:06:46.200 align:start position:0%
appointed to another study Community
 
01:06:48.410 --> 01:06:48.420 align:start position:0%
commission I think has Value Plus the
 
01:06:51.109 --> 01:06:51.119 align:start position:0%
county delegation yes
 
01:06:53.690 --> 01:06:53.700 align:start position:0%
well you just get the letters on that
 
01:06:55.910 --> 01:06:55.920 align:start position:0%
they just they don't ask you that's true
 
01:07:04.670 --> 01:07:04.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:07.730 --> 01:07:07.740 align:start position:0%
what is on the governor's office so that
 
01:07:10.309 --> 01:07:10.319 align:start position:0%
so this is if I had a
 
01:07:12.829 --> 01:07:12.839 align:start position:0%
if I had a wish if I was having to
 
01:07:14.990 --> 01:07:15.000 align:start position:0%
administer these things I would try to
 
01:07:17.390 --> 01:07:17.400 align:start position:0%
minimize how many Governor appointments
 
01:07:19.370 --> 01:07:19.380 align:start position:0%
there are on these commissions because
 
01:07:23.109 --> 01:07:23.119 align:start position:0%
it just takes four ever
 
01:07:25.910 --> 01:07:25.920 align:start position:0%
and the governor is like okay you have
 
01:07:28.910 --> 01:07:28.920 align:start position:0%
to you know appoint somebody from you
 
01:07:32.270 --> 01:07:32.280 align:start position:0%
know who who who has Abode on a
 
01:07:35.150 --> 01:07:35.160 align:start position:0%
particular type of water body you know
 
01:07:36.349 --> 01:07:36.359 align:start position:0%
it's just
 
01:07:39.170 --> 01:07:39.180 align:start position:0%
it's a really difficult task and it
 
01:07:39.180 --> 01:07:39.950 align:start position:0%
it's a really difficult task and it
really

01:07:39.950 --> 01:07:39.960 align:start position:0%
really
 
01:07:42.410 --> 01:07:42.420 align:start position:0%
um affects the ability of committees I
 
01:07:44.329 --> 01:07:44.339 align:start position:0%
mean enough these commissions to work in
 
01:07:46.010 --> 01:07:46.020 align:start position:0%
fact the first
 
01:07:47.990 --> 01:07:48.000 align:start position:0%
committee on committees that I chaired
 
01:07:52.069 --> 01:07:52.079 align:start position:0%
it was actually a creation of hb2
 
01:07:54.230 --> 01:07:54.240 align:start position:0%
from the governor
 
01:07:56.630 --> 01:07:56.640 align:start position:0%
to create a committee to look at not
 
01:07:58.430 --> 01:07:58.440 align:start position:0%
only study committees and commissions
 
01:08:01.010 --> 01:08:01.020 align:start position:0%
well commissions but also commissions
 
01:08:02.870 --> 01:08:02.880 align:start position:0%
that are established by executive order
 
01:08:05.569 --> 01:08:05.579 align:start position:0%
so we had somebody from the labor
 
01:08:08.089 --> 01:08:08.099 align:start position:0%
department and a representative of the
 
01:08:10.430 --> 01:08:10.440 align:start position:0%
of the governor's office sitting on our
 
01:08:12.410 --> 01:08:12.420 align:start position:0%
committee on committees and not only did
 
01:08:14.230 --> 01:08:14.240 align:start position:0%
we look at all the
 
01:08:17.030 --> 01:08:17.040 align:start position:0%
statutory commissions administered
 
01:08:19.970 --> 01:08:19.980 align:start position:0%
through agencies but also all the ones
 
01:08:21.829 --> 01:08:21.839 align:start position:0%
that were created by executive orders
 
01:08:24.650 --> 01:08:24.660 align:start position:0%
because the question that which we
 
01:08:26.689 --> 01:08:26.699 align:start position:0%
couldn't we couldn't snuff by the way
 
01:08:28.370 --> 01:08:28.380 align:start position:0%
that had to be done by the governor's
 
01:08:30.590 --> 01:08:30.600 align:start position:0%
office well so one of the follow-up
 
01:08:34.490 --> 01:08:34.500 align:start position:0%
questions is were you also Brad is uh
 
01:08:36.110 --> 01:08:36.120 align:start position:0%
how many
 
01:08:38.809 --> 01:08:38.819 align:start position:0%
commissions do we have that have no zero
 
01:08:41.749 --> 01:08:41.759 align:start position:0%
legislators on that are only populated
 
01:08:45.769 --> 01:08:45.779 align:start position:0%
by executive function by the governor's
 
01:08:47.990 --> 01:08:48.000 align:start position:0%
appointments that may be on this
 
01:08:50.510 --> 01:08:50.520 align:start position:0%
template I'm not I'm not sure whether
 
01:08:53.570 --> 01:08:53.580 align:start position:0%
they I mean this well should we should
 
01:08:56.510 --> 01:08:56.520 align:start position:0%
well the question is should we mandate
 
01:08:58.669 --> 01:08:58.679 align:start position:0%
that that should be legislative at least
 
01:09:00.650 --> 01:09:00.660 align:start position:0%
some legislators on every commission I
 
01:09:02.870 --> 01:09:02.880 align:start position:0%
mean that would be exactly the opposite
 
01:09:05.689 --> 01:09:05.699 align:start position:0%
I think of what we're trying to do is to
 
01:09:08.030 --> 01:09:08.040 align:start position:0%
minimize legislative effort I mean I
 
01:09:10.610 --> 01:09:10.620 align:start position:0%
don't think we monitor uh commissions
 
01:09:14.689 --> 01:09:14.699 align:start position:0%
that don't have legislators on them
 
01:09:19.550 --> 01:09:19.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:21.890 --> 01:09:21.900 align:start position:0%
and I need
 
01:09:25.669 --> 01:09:25.679 align:start position:0%
we could just keep going and going but
 
01:09:27.769 --> 01:09:27.779 align:start position:0%
um I think that's a that's an area that
 
01:09:30.169 --> 01:09:30.179 align:start position:0%
we don't even get into and then there
 
01:09:32.329 --> 01:09:32.339 align:start position:0%
are several boards and commissions they
 
01:09:34.370 --> 01:09:34.380 align:start position:0%
have to stay in place they're not going
 
01:09:37.130 --> 01:09:37.140 align:start position:0%
to go away you know depending on what
 
01:09:39.709 --> 01:09:39.719 align:start position:0%
their responsibilities are right like
 
01:09:41.870 --> 01:09:41.880 align:start position:0%
jail Carr I mean there are all kinds of
 
01:09:43.309 --> 01:09:43.319 align:start position:0%
things like that that we didn't even
 
01:09:44.930 --> 01:09:44.940 align:start position:0%
look at
 
01:09:48.050 --> 01:09:48.060 align:start position:0%
but anyway as I say I think if we could
 
01:09:51.349 --> 01:09:51.359 align:start position:0%
set out create a template that OLS and
 
01:09:53.630 --> 01:09:53.640 align:start position:0%
everybody would just follow that is also
 
01:09:56.450 --> 01:09:56.460 align:start position:0%
shared with the legislators if we could
 
01:10:00.709 --> 01:10:00.719 align:start position:0%
have like a a script for committees when
 
01:10:02.930 --> 01:10:02.940 align:start position:0%
they're analyzing whether to approve the
 
01:10:05.150 --> 01:10:05.160 align:start position:0%
creation of something I think that would
 
01:10:07.669 --> 01:10:07.679 align:start position:0%
be really helpful as we're going into
 
01:10:09.130 --> 01:10:09.140 align:start position:0%
this fall
 
01:10:13.669 --> 01:10:13.679 align:start position:0%
and then to work with HCS and and the
 
01:10:16.490 --> 01:10:16.500 align:start position:0%
Senate too but if you are going to be in
 
01:10:18.470 --> 01:10:18.480 align:start position:0%
charge of a study committee these are
 
01:10:20.750 --> 01:10:20.760 align:start position:0%
the things that you have to do
 
01:10:22.850 --> 01:10:22.860 align:start position:0%
I think those three things would really
 
01:10:28.550 --> 01:10:28.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:31.490 --> 01:10:31.500 align:start position:0%
go ahead man yeah so
 
01:10:34.669 --> 01:10:34.679 align:start position:0%
um if I'm understanding this correctly
 
01:10:38.270 --> 01:10:38.280 align:start position:0%
we're going to concentrate on
 
01:10:41.450 --> 01:10:41.460 align:start position:0%
being proactive for future committees
 
01:10:42.770 --> 01:10:42.780 align:start position:0%
and commissions by setting up that
 
01:10:42.780 --> 01:10:43.910 align:start position:0%
and commissions by setting up that
template

01:10:43.910 --> 01:10:43.920 align:start position:0%
template
 
01:10:48.110 --> 01:10:48.120 align:start position:0%
but we're also going to talk about maybe
 
01:10:51.229 --> 01:10:51.239 align:start position:0%
putting some structure into past
 
01:10:53.390 --> 01:10:53.400 align:start position:0%
the Committees and commissions that have
 
01:10:55.490 --> 01:10:55.500 align:start position:0%
already been established legislation for
 
01:10:57.950 --> 01:10:57.960 align:start position:0%
that that they would have to go back and
 
01:11:00.890 --> 01:11:00.900 align:start position:0%
like put a Sunset date on
 
01:11:03.770 --> 01:11:03.780 align:start position:0%
we can we can talk about that okay I
 
01:11:05.330 --> 01:11:05.340 align:start position:0%
don't know what those things would be
 
01:11:07.910 --> 01:11:07.920 align:start position:0%
exactly but maybe repeal or something
 
01:11:11.390 --> 01:11:11.400 align:start position:0%
and um and instead of like going through
 
01:11:13.010 --> 01:11:13.020 align:start position:0%
and redoing the work that you've already
 
01:11:14.630 --> 01:11:14.640 align:start position:0%
done over the past three years and
 
01:11:17.390 --> 01:11:17.400 align:start position:0%
looking at that low-hanging fruit and
 
01:11:21.169 --> 01:11:21.179 align:start position:0%
and repealing those we're gonna
 
01:11:24.290 --> 01:11:24.300 align:start position:0%
um kind of lean on the Excel spreadsheet
 
01:11:26.330 --> 01:11:26.340 align:start position:0%
that they're working on and those things
 
01:11:28.189 --> 01:11:28.199 align:start position:0%
will just kind of work themselves out on
 
01:11:30.830 --> 01:11:30.840 align:start position:0%
their own yeah you're saying we can see
 
01:11:32.689 --> 01:11:32.699 align:start position:0%
if that works if it doesn't we might
 
01:11:36.350 --> 01:11:36.360 align:start position:0%
have to regroup but I think I mean I
 
01:11:38.870 --> 01:11:38.880 align:start position:0%
think that would be great I I mean I
 
01:11:40.910 --> 01:11:40.920 align:start position:0%
just think it would be really good I
 
01:11:42.890 --> 01:11:42.900 align:start position:0%
mean what what my committee on
 
01:11:44.750 --> 01:11:44.760 align:start position:0%
committees did was sort of look at the
 
01:11:48.229 --> 01:11:48.239 align:start position:0%
past and try to make recommendations you
 
01:11:50.090 --> 01:11:50.100 align:start position:0%
know fewer recommendations for the
 
01:11:52.070 --> 01:11:52.080 align:start position:0%
future I think what we should really be
 
01:11:54.950 --> 01:11:54.960 align:start position:0%
doing in the first instance is be
 
01:11:56.870 --> 01:11:56.880 align:start position:0%
looking to the Future to how to to
 
01:11:59.149 --> 01:11:59.159 align:start position:0%
impose some structure on the future
 
01:12:01.669 --> 01:12:01.679 align:start position:0%
development of these things and try to
 
01:12:03.590 --> 01:12:03.600 align:start position:0%
figure out good ways of doing that
 
01:12:07.729 --> 01:12:07.739 align:start position:0%
looking at all the players like OLS the
 
01:12:09.590 --> 01:12:09.600 align:start position:0%
standing committees the speaker's office
 
01:12:15.070 --> 01:12:15.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:17.810 --> 01:12:17.820 align:start position:0%
thank you and I apologize for being late
 
01:12:19.790 --> 01:12:19.800 align:start position:0%
it was unavoidable
 
01:12:21.410 --> 01:12:21.420 align:start position:0%
um I'm gonna leave early to make up for
 
01:12:24.229 --> 01:12:24.239 align:start position:0%
you well I may be picking up on the
 
01:12:26.390 --> 01:12:26.400 align:start position:0%
wrong thread here so cut me off if I am
 
01:12:26.400 --> 01:12:27.410 align:start position:0%
wrong thread here so cut me off if I am
please

01:12:27.410 --> 01:12:27.420 align:start position:0%
please
 
01:12:28.729 --> 01:12:28.739 align:start position:0%
um I've been on a number of commissions
 
01:12:30.649 --> 01:12:30.659 align:start position:0%
and study committees and this that and
 
01:12:31.790 --> 01:12:31.800 align:start position:0%
the other
 
01:12:33.890 --> 01:12:33.900 align:start position:0%
um I think it's imperative that we start
 
01:12:36.649 --> 01:12:36.659 align:start position:0%
also at the base in our committees
 
01:12:38.750 --> 01:12:38.760 align:start position:0%
having the leadership of committees the
 
01:12:40.550 --> 01:12:40.560 align:start position:0%
ranking members the chairman Vice
 
01:12:42.830 --> 01:12:42.840 align:start position:0%
chairman knowing members see we're not
 
01:12:44.930 --> 01:12:44.940 align:start position:0%
meeting as much as we used to and it's
 
01:12:47.149 --> 01:12:47.159 align:start position:0%
making it hard for people to know where
 
01:12:48.890 --> 01:12:48.900 align:start position:0%
people's strengths and weaknesses are
 
01:12:51.709 --> 01:12:51.719 align:start position:0%
and what their interests are but um it's
 
01:12:53.930 --> 01:12:53.940 align:start position:0%
a I think it's imperative to have the
 
01:12:55.550 --> 01:12:55.560 align:start position:0%
leadership of the Committees recommend
 
01:12:58.910 --> 01:12:58.920 align:start position:0%
to the speaker's office who they want to
 
01:13:00.530 --> 01:13:00.540 align:start position:0%
be on these commissions and committees
 
01:13:03.649 --> 01:13:03.659 align:start position:0%
also and we were always reminded years
 
01:13:06.290 --> 01:13:06.300 align:start position:0%
ago when any of these bills came before
 
01:13:09.050 --> 01:13:09.060 align:start position:0%
us in our committees
 
01:13:11.450 --> 01:13:11.460 align:start position:0%
um to make sure we had details
 
01:13:13.669 --> 01:13:13.679 align:start position:0%
as to what the commissions were to
 
01:13:13.679 --> 01:13:14.870 align:start position:0%
as to what the commissions were to
accomplish

01:13:14.870 --> 01:13:14.880 align:start position:0%
accomplish
 
01:13:18.350 --> 01:13:18.360 align:start position:0%
and deadlines for things and um if we as
 
01:13:20.630 --> 01:13:20.640 align:start position:0%
clear Claire I'm sorry I'm thinking
 
01:13:24.649 --> 01:13:24.659 align:start position:0%
clear evil back when I'm sorry as Karen
 
01:13:24.659 --> 01:13:25.910 align:start position:0%
clear evil back when I'm sorry as Karen
suggested

01:13:25.910 --> 01:13:25.920 align:start position:0%
suggested
 
01:13:28.669 --> 01:13:28.679 align:start position:0%
um look at the past to see some of what
 
01:13:31.370 --> 01:13:31.380 align:start position:0%
has worked and carry that forward and
 
01:13:34.450 --> 01:13:34.460 align:start position:0%
then uh add on to what has been
 
01:13:39.110 --> 01:13:39.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:41.870 --> 01:13:41.880 align:start position:0%
because I in the past
 
01:13:44.149 --> 01:13:44.159 align:start position:0%
I thought things went pretty smoothly
 
01:13:46.370 --> 01:13:46.380 align:start position:0%
all in all but it's been more Awkward
 
01:13:48.770 --> 01:13:48.780 align:start position:0%
especially since covid because we don't
 
01:13:51.350 --> 01:13:51.360 align:start position:0%
know each other we don't know as I said
 
01:13:53.090 --> 01:13:53.100 align:start position:0%
what people's interests and strengths
 
01:13:56.870 --> 01:13:56.880 align:start position:0%
are and so I think when I'll as we move
 
01:14:00.470 --> 01:14:00.480 align:start position:0%
more into in-person meetings and such uh
 
01:14:02.330 --> 01:14:02.340 align:start position:0%
we'll have a better sense on our own
 
01:14:05.390 --> 01:14:05.400 align:start position:0%
committees as to how to recommend to the
 
01:14:06.890 --> 01:14:06.900 align:start position:0%
speaker to help the speaker's office
 
01:14:10.729 --> 01:14:10.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:12.169 --> 01:14:12.179 align:start position:0%
um I was just going to say one of the
 
01:14:14.149 --> 01:14:14.159 align:start position:0%
things if we're creating a template for
 
01:14:16.970 --> 01:14:16.980 align:start position:0%
creating commissions or committees um
 
01:14:19.490 --> 01:14:19.500 align:start position:0%
for instance I'll just give as an
 
01:14:21.470 --> 01:14:21.480 align:start position:0%
example when we were doing our committee
 
01:14:23.149 --> 01:14:23.159 align:start position:0%
on committees we found there were
 
01:14:25.310 --> 01:14:25.320 align:start position:0%
several statutory commissions that had
 
01:14:28.010 --> 01:14:28.020 align:start position:0%
stakeholder groups but they were they
 
01:14:31.070 --> 01:14:31.080 align:start position:0%
had like four and five reps
 
01:14:34.370 --> 01:14:34.380 align:start position:0%
you know and to do their to do the work
 
01:14:36.530 --> 01:14:36.540 align:start position:0%
you didn't need four Representatives you
 
01:14:39.350 --> 01:14:39.360 align:start position:0%
could have two now I know in the statute
 
01:14:41.330 --> 01:14:41.340 align:start position:0%
now it says something about having a
 
01:14:43.370 --> 01:14:43.380 align:start position:0%
majority of the membership on the
 
01:14:45.770 --> 01:14:45.780 align:start position:0%
commissions be representatives and I
 
01:14:46.910 --> 01:14:46.920 align:start position:0%
think that's
 
01:14:49.189 --> 01:14:49.199 align:start position:0%
I think that's an idea to try to get
 
01:14:51.169 --> 01:14:51.179 align:start position:0%
people really invested in a commission
 
01:14:53.570 --> 01:14:53.580 align:start position:0%
before they'll create it but from a
 
01:14:57.050 --> 01:14:57.060 align:start position:0%
functional standpoint it um it creates a
 
01:14:59.149 --> 01:14:59.159 align:start position:0%
lot more work for legislators I think it
 
01:15:01.250 --> 01:15:01.260 align:start position:0%
creates numbers that we can't support
 
01:15:04.370 --> 01:15:04.380 align:start position:0%
well and the thing is you just know that
 
01:15:06.649 --> 01:15:06.659 align:start position:0%
that particular section of it is
 
01:15:09.110 --> 01:15:09.120 align:start position:0%
something that any legislator is going
 
01:15:11.149 --> 01:15:11.159 align:start position:0%
to go in and probably override in the
 
01:15:13.070 --> 01:15:13.080 align:start position:0%
construction of their new
 
01:15:13.080 --> 01:15:17.450 align:start position:0%
construction of their new
Commission

01:15:17.450 --> 01:15:17.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:18.890 --> 01:15:18.900 align:start position:0%
yes ma'am
 
01:15:20.630 --> 01:15:20.640 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you again
 
01:15:22.669 --> 01:15:22.679 align:start position:0%
and you're right Karen
 
01:15:22.679 --> 01:15:23.630 align:start position:0%
and you're right Karen
um

01:15:23.630 --> 01:15:23.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:15:26.390 --> 01:15:26.400 align:start position:0%
I also firmly believe that we should not
 
01:15:28.189 --> 01:15:28.199 align:start position:0%
be drawing people in from the agencies
 
01:15:30.649 --> 01:15:30.659 align:start position:0%
and departments except for Testimony
 
01:15:33.050 --> 01:15:33.060 align:start position:0%
participation but not as members of
 
01:15:35.390 --> 01:15:35.400 align:start position:0%
because one of the issues we've always
 
01:15:38.330 --> 01:15:38.340 align:start position:0%
had is who has voting rights and who
 
01:15:40.970 --> 01:15:40.980 align:start position:0%
doesn't on these commissions and it's a
 
01:15:42.950 --> 01:15:42.960 align:start position:0%
conflict of interest if we're working on
 
01:15:45.290 --> 01:15:45.300 align:start position:0%
something that affects Des for example
 
01:15:47.570 --> 01:15:47.580 align:start position:0%
for them to be promoting their own thing
 
01:15:49.370 --> 01:15:49.380 align:start position:0%
and voting for their own thing that's
 
01:15:51.890 --> 01:15:51.900 align:start position:0%
not fair to them furthermore in terms of
 
01:15:54.590 --> 01:15:54.600 align:start position:0%
time these people have jobs to do and
 
01:15:56.030 --> 01:15:56.040 align:start position:0%
they should be coming in when it's
 
01:15:59.149 --> 01:15:59.159 align:start position:0%
appropriate to offer input that the
 
01:16:01.669 --> 01:16:01.679 align:start position:0%
commission or committee needs thank you
 
01:16:04.010 --> 01:16:04.020 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean I I would agree with that
 
01:16:06.410 --> 01:16:06.420 align:start position:0%
that's just like this whole statutory
 
01:16:08.630 --> 01:16:08.640 align:start position:0%
commission versus study committee thing
 
01:16:11.090 --> 01:16:11.100 align:start position:0%
you're putting a huge onus on these
 
01:16:13.610 --> 01:16:13.620 align:start position:0%
various agencies if you have them
 
01:16:16.010 --> 01:16:16.020 align:start position:0%
assigned to multiple commissions time
 
01:16:18.169 --> 01:16:18.179 align:start position:0%
that they don't have so
 
01:16:21.110 --> 01:16:21.120 align:start position:0%
I don't know it's a it's a complicated
 
01:16:23.990 --> 01:16:24.000 align:start position:0%
subject and you also have
 
01:16:26.510 --> 01:16:26.520 align:start position:0%
when they create them by Statute you
 
01:16:29.030 --> 01:16:29.040 align:start position:0%
just have all these different in in
 
01:16:31.669 --> 01:16:31.679 align:start position:0%
um iterations like who's the convening
 
01:16:34.669 --> 01:16:34.679 align:start position:0%
body who's responsible for Staffing them
 
01:16:37.910 --> 01:16:37.920 align:start position:0%
if it's an agency if it's a corporation
 
01:16:40.189 --> 01:16:40.199 align:start position:0%
I mean it just it gets really
 
01:16:43.370 --> 01:16:43.380 align:start position:0%
complicated and then the other issue and
 
01:16:45.709 --> 01:16:45.719 align:start position:0%
I know Paul has dealt with this is how
 
01:16:48.050 --> 01:16:48.060 align:start position:0%
much we carry on our website how much of
 
01:16:50.810 --> 01:16:50.820 align:start position:0%
it is required to be in our calendar if
 
01:16:53.090 --> 01:16:53.100 align:start position:0%
it's not in our calendar how do we track
 
01:16:53.100 --> 01:16:54.470 align:start position:0%
it's not in our calendar how do we track
it

01:16:54.470 --> 01:16:54.480 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:16:57.350 --> 01:16:57.360 align:start position:0%
it gets a little eye-crossing but all we
 
01:17:00.590 --> 01:17:00.600 align:start position:0%
can do is the best we can do
 
01:17:04.130 --> 01:17:04.140 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman and I I also building upon
 
01:17:05.689 --> 01:17:05.699 align:start position:0%
what Karen has said
 
01:17:08.149 --> 01:17:08.159 align:start position:0%
um it's imperative that if the
 
01:17:09.950 --> 01:17:09.960 align:start position:0%
legislature sets up the commission it
 
01:17:12.310 --> 01:17:12.320 align:start position:0%
should be staffed by legislative people
 
01:17:16.850 --> 01:17:16.860 align:start position:0%
our own employees our own staff that's
 
01:17:19.550 --> 01:17:19.560 align:start position:0%
appropriate and it should be listed in
 
01:17:21.590 --> 01:17:21.600 align:start position:0%
our own calendar as our regular meetings
 
01:17:24.229 --> 01:17:24.239 align:start position:0%
are I I don't like this concept of
 
01:17:26.990 --> 01:17:27.000 align:start position:0%
possibly having commissions meet across
 
01:17:29.270 --> 01:17:29.280 align:start position:0%
the river or at the Departments and
 
01:17:31.910 --> 01:17:31.920 align:start position:0%
agencies I I think anything that's a
 
01:17:33.590 --> 01:17:33.600 align:start position:0%
legislative establishment should be
 
01:17:38.209 --> 01:17:38.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:41.450 --> 01:17:41.460 align:start position:0%
well if we try to if we I mean that's an
 
01:17:44.750 --> 01:17:44.760 align:start position:0%
idea if we have a commission
 
01:17:44.760 --> 01:17:45.530 align:start position:0%
idea if we have a commission
um

01:17:45.530 --> 01:17:45.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:17:48.290 --> 01:17:48.300 align:start position:0%
it should we should require it to be
 
01:17:50.450 --> 01:17:50.460 align:start position:0%
calendared in our thing and then if we
 
01:17:52.910 --> 01:17:52.920 align:start position:0%
work with it then maybe if it's in our
 
01:17:55.729 --> 01:17:55.739 align:start position:0%
calendar it can fit it into our Excel
 
01:17:58.010 --> 01:17:58.020 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet so that we'll know when
 
01:17:59.570 --> 01:17:59.580 align:start position:0%
these things are meeting so if we're
 
01:18:01.850 --> 01:18:01.860 align:start position:0%
trying to assess something that hasn't
 
01:18:04.610 --> 01:18:04.620 align:start position:0%
been needed the data I mean I'd like to
 
01:18:06.350 --> 01:18:06.360 align:start position:0%
figure out a way where where these
 
01:18:08.570 --> 01:18:08.580 align:start position:0%
things are automatically populated and
 
01:18:11.330 --> 01:18:11.340 align:start position:0%
it doesn't require staff to call a
 
01:18:12.950 --> 01:18:12.960 align:start position:0%
commission and ask them how much they've
 
01:18:15.110 --> 01:18:15.120 align:start position:0%
met in the last five years or you know
 
01:18:17.570 --> 01:18:17.580 align:start position:0%
month or something I think that would be
 
01:18:20.450 --> 01:18:20.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:22.729 --> 01:18:22.739 align:start position:0%
do you think we should be able to see it
 
01:18:24.649 --> 01:18:24.659 align:start position:0%
as documented in the calendar how many
 
01:18:26.630 --> 01:18:26.640 align:start position:0%
times they've met for example well
 
01:18:26.640 --> 01:18:27.649 align:start position:0%
times they've met for example well
to

01:18:27.649 --> 01:18:27.659 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:18:29.810 --> 01:18:29.820 align:start position:0%
yeah but to figure out a way to feed
 
01:18:32.810 --> 01:18:32.820 align:start position:0%
that information in in some over
 
01:18:36.169 --> 01:18:36.179 align:start position:0%
document that we have for the because
 
01:18:37.790 --> 01:18:37.800 align:start position:0%
that's what so when we did it before
 
01:18:40.790 --> 01:18:40.800 align:start position:0%
that's what Pam Harner I mean Pam had to
 
01:18:43.250 --> 01:18:43.260 align:start position:0%
do she had to call every commission and
 
01:18:46.130 --> 01:18:46.140 align:start position:0%
try to figure out how much they met what
 
01:18:48.410 --> 01:18:48.420 align:start position:0%
their statutory basis was what their
 
01:18:53.270 --> 01:18:53.280 align:start position:0%
membership was who the chair was I mean
 
01:18:53.280 --> 01:18:55.070 align:start position:0%
membership was who the chair was I mean
yeah

01:18:55.070 --> 01:18:55.080 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:18:57.530 --> 01:18:57.540 align:start position:0%
yeah it's just really hard to figure out
 
01:18:59.390 --> 01:18:59.400 align:start position:0%
I mean
 
01:19:02.330 --> 01:19:02.340 align:start position:0%
no you wouldn't and it took her easily
 
01:19:07.189 --> 01:19:07.199 align:start position:0%
six months I mean months months
 
01:19:09.649 --> 01:19:09.659 align:start position:0%
which is the document that's in here and
 
01:19:11.570 --> 01:19:11.580 align:start position:0%
now I know Deborah's done a ton more
 
01:19:13.550 --> 01:19:13.560 align:start position:0%
work on it
 
01:19:15.290 --> 01:19:15.300 align:start position:0%
so so
 
01:19:18.110 --> 01:19:18.120 align:start position:0%
let me take that as to uh to The Next
 
01:19:21.410 --> 01:19:21.420 align:start position:0%
Step was what do we need to do I know we
 
01:19:24.169 --> 01:19:24.179 align:start position:0%
we we're leaving Brad
 
01:19:27.350 --> 01:19:27.360 align:start position:0%
with some additional tacit to finish the
 
01:19:34.790 --> 01:19:34.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:37.189 --> 01:19:37.199 align:start position:0%
I wrote it down I just kind of figured
 
01:19:44.570 --> 01:19:44.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:47.750 --> 01:19:47.760 align:start position:0%
well we talked about uh creating the
 
01:19:49.610 --> 01:19:49.620 align:start position:0%
template for future study commissions
 
01:19:53.390 --> 01:19:53.400 align:start position:0%
and representative wall had talked uh
 
01:19:56.149 --> 01:19:56.159 align:start position:0%
at length about that uh
 
01:19:57.830 --> 01:19:57.840 align:start position:0%
a few weeks ago
 
01:19:57.840 --> 01:19:59.030 align:start position:0%
a few weeks ago
so

01:19:59.030 --> 01:19:59.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:19:59.040 --> 01:20:00.470 align:start position:0%
so
um

01:20:00.470 --> 01:20:00.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:00.480 --> 01:20:01.850 align:start position:0%
um
well

01:20:01.850 --> 01:20:01.860 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:20:04.370 --> 01:20:04.380 align:start position:0%
man you keep working on the on the
 
01:20:06.950 --> 01:20:06.960 align:start position:0%
mapping exercise
 
01:20:06.960 --> 01:20:08.870 align:start position:0%
mapping exercise
um

01:20:08.870 --> 01:20:08.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:12.830 --> 01:20:12.840 align:start position:0%
do we want to solicit a a subcommittee
 
01:20:16.370 --> 01:20:16.380 align:start position:0%
of this committee to to go off and
 
01:20:18.290 --> 01:20:18.300 align:start position:0%
start working on that template for
 
01:20:20.270 --> 01:20:20.280 align:start position:0%
future study commissions of what what
 
01:20:23.149 --> 01:20:23.159 align:start position:0%
that ought to be is Karen
 
01:20:25.669 --> 01:20:25.679 align:start position:0%
uh my suggestion would be that rather
 
01:20:28.790 --> 01:20:28.800 align:start position:0%
than Reinventing the wheel we ask uh Mr
 
01:20:31.250 --> 01:20:31.260 align:start position:0%
alakunas to come in and tell us what
 
01:20:35.330 --> 01:20:35.340 align:start position:0%
their starting document is now and then
 
01:20:37.970 --> 01:20:37.980 align:start position:0%
we make sure that it covers what and I'm
 
01:20:39.950 --> 01:20:39.960 align:start position:0%
sure he will it'll cover what is in
 
01:20:41.930 --> 01:20:41.940 align:start position:0%
there statutorily and we just look at
 
01:20:44.689 --> 01:20:44.699 align:start position:0%
that and see what else we wanna we would
 
01:20:47.630 --> 01:20:47.640 align:start position:0%
want to add to it and then develop also
 
01:20:52.250 --> 01:20:52.260 align:start position:0%
the script enabling OLS to always ask
 
01:20:53.750 --> 01:20:53.760 align:start position:0%
the questions like have you done
 
01:20:56.270 --> 01:20:56.280 align:start position:0%
research is is the eighth which is a
 
01:20:58.310 --> 01:20:58.320 align:start position:0%
week from today is that if it's a good
 
01:21:00.950 --> 01:21:00.960 align:start position:0%
day for you thanks
 
01:21:04.250 --> 01:21:04.260 align:start position:0%
okay so so maybe Brad you can help us
 
01:21:06.649 --> 01:21:06.659 align:start position:0%
round up alakunas to get him here in the
 
01:21:09.110 --> 01:21:09.120 align:start position:0%
eighth with that task as to
 
01:21:11.510 --> 01:21:11.520 align:start position:0%
as to
 
01:21:14.209 --> 01:21:14.219 align:start position:0%
what his current where he is with the
 
01:21:16.490 --> 01:21:16.500 align:start position:0%
starting documentary we had spoken to
 
01:21:16.500 --> 01:21:17.450 align:start position:0%
starting documentary we had spoken to
him

01:21:17.450 --> 01:21:17.460 align:start position:0%
him
 
01:21:20.990 --> 01:21:21.000 align:start position:0%
the first day that we we met so he we
 
01:21:24.290 --> 01:21:24.300 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be catching him cold uh and
 
01:21:26.570 --> 01:21:26.580 align:start position:0%
that way that that can be maybe the
 
01:21:29.149 --> 01:21:29.159 align:start position:0%
kickoff thought process if you will for
 
01:21:31.729 --> 01:21:31.739 align:start position:0%
for creating a template that we want to
 
01:21:31.739 --> 01:21:35.030 align:start position:0%
for creating a template that we want to
create

01:21:35.030 --> 01:21:35.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:37.970 --> 01:21:37.980 align:start position:0%
yeah great okay thanks yes man if it if
 
01:21:39.649 --> 01:21:39.659 align:start position:0%
it's an oh sorry
 
01:21:41.570 --> 01:21:41.580 align:start position:0%
um if it all possible
 
01:21:43.910 --> 01:21:43.920 align:start position:0%
um to have it circulated to us before we
 
01:21:45.350 --> 01:21:45.360 align:start position:0%
meet I understand that he'll probably
 
01:21:47.030 --> 01:21:47.040 align:start position:0%
want to explain it to us and it may not
 
01:21:49.490 --> 01:21:49.500 align:start position:0%
be entirely clear but I think it'll be
 
01:21:51.530 --> 01:21:51.540 align:start position:0%
helpful for us to start thinking
 
01:21:54.169 --> 01:21:54.179 align:start position:0%
what we don't see or want to see or
 
01:21:55.850 --> 01:21:55.860 align:start position:0%
rather than just getting it fresh and
 
01:21:57.290 --> 01:21:57.300 align:start position:0%
maybe we can be more productive with it
 
01:21:59.330 --> 01:21:59.340 align:start position:0%
when we do get to speak with them yeah
 
01:22:02.870 --> 01:22:02.880 align:start position:0%
I'll certainly also pass it on to uh
 
01:22:04.610 --> 01:22:04.620 align:start position:0%
representative to check
 
01:22:07.790 --> 01:22:07.800 align:start position:0%
I'm going to be in Spain next Monday the
 
01:22:10.669 --> 01:22:10.679 align:start position:0%
8th I'll go into a family wedding so I
 
01:22:14.290 --> 01:22:14.300 align:start position:0%
won't be here but yes we certainly can
 
01:22:16.850 --> 01:22:16.860 align:start position:0%
uh you only get
 
01:22:16.860 --> 01:22:25.630 align:start position:0%
uh you only get
mileage

01:22:25.630 --> 01:22:25.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:27.950 --> 01:22:27.960 align:start position:0%
I mean we can start a little late maybe
 
01:22:29.870 --> 01:22:29.880 align:start position:0%
that day
 
01:22:29.880 --> 01:22:32.990 align:start position:0%
that day
um

01:22:32.990 --> 01:22:33.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:35.570 --> 01:22:35.580 align:start position:0%
okay so maybe we could ask alicunas to
 
01:22:36.950 --> 01:22:36.960 align:start position:0%
bring that
 
01:22:40.370 --> 01:22:40.380 align:start position:0%
uh rather uh circulate that document
 
01:22:43.490 --> 01:22:43.500 align:start position:0%
ahead of time to the to the 10 of us and
 
01:22:47.689 --> 01:22:47.699 align:start position:0%
also uh you guys and probably Deb
 
01:22:50.689 --> 01:22:50.699 align:start position:0%
and uh maybe Ian would want a copy of it
 
01:22:53.030 --> 01:22:53.040 align:start position:0%
too uh
 
01:22:55.430 --> 01:22:55.440 align:start position:0%
and that will help get us going in but
 
01:22:59.750 --> 01:22:59.760 align:start position:0%
when that when alicunus comes and and he
 
01:23:02.450 --> 01:23:02.460 align:start position:0%
prepares us with that document
 
01:23:05.750 --> 01:23:05.760 align:start position:0%
uh I think it might not be a bad idea if
 
01:23:08.750 --> 01:23:08.760 align:start position:0%
if a subset of us
 
01:23:11.750 --> 01:23:11.760 align:start position:0%
es that as a kickoff point just to do
 
01:23:11.760 --> 01:23:12.950 align:start position:0%
es that as a kickoff point just to do
the

01:23:12.950 --> 01:23:12.960 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:23:15.590 --> 01:23:15.600 align:start position:0%
uh just begin working on that on that
 
01:23:18.290 --> 01:23:18.300 align:start position:0%
Commission on the uh template study
 
01:23:19.790 --> 01:23:19.800 align:start position:0%
commission template
 
01:23:22.850 --> 01:23:22.860 align:start position:0%
uh that we can educate our fellow
 
01:23:25.850 --> 01:23:25.860 align:start position:0%
legislators and committee uh chair men
 
01:23:28.070 --> 01:23:28.080 align:start position:0%
and women as to what the expectations
 
01:23:29.810 --> 01:23:29.820 align:start position:0%
are for
 
01:23:32.570 --> 01:23:32.580 align:start position:0%
for commissions going forward and so
 
01:23:35.450 --> 01:23:35.460 align:start position:0%
we'll think of this in the in the future
 
01:23:38.570 --> 01:23:38.580 align:start position:0%
uh mindset as opposed to going back and
 
01:23:41.030 --> 01:23:41.040 align:start position:0%
trying to fix other things in the past
 
01:23:43.850 --> 01:23:43.860 align:start position:0%
or or to
 
01:23:46.790 --> 01:23:46.800 align:start position:0%
lay some additional work on the work
 
01:23:49.130 --> 01:23:49.140 align:start position:0%
that Karen did we'll try to maybe focus
 
01:23:53.570 --> 01:23:53.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:55.790 --> 01:23:55.800 align:start position:0%
you have another filing period coming up
 
01:23:57.229 --> 01:23:57.239 align:start position:0%
and there's going to be a lot of these
 
01:23:59.030 --> 01:23:59.040 align:start position:0%
things proposed we might as well try to
 
01:24:03.530 --> 01:24:03.540 align:start position:0%
do what we can right um in advance so
 
01:24:07.430 --> 01:24:07.440 align:start position:0%
um if David I mean I would say we'd want
 
01:24:10.610 --> 01:24:10.620 align:start position:0%
to know about study committees and study
 
01:24:12.290 --> 01:24:12.300 align:start position:0%
commissions if there are basic things
 
01:24:14.930 --> 01:24:14.940 align:start position:0%
that they include in them and then it'd
 
01:24:17.030 --> 01:24:17.040 align:start position:0%
be interesting to know
 
01:24:21.169 --> 01:24:21.179 align:start position:0%
you know what questions a drafter asks a
 
01:24:23.810 --> 01:24:23.820 align:start position:0%
member in trying to structure these
 
01:24:26.030 --> 01:24:26.040 align:start position:0%
things you know and then we could work
 
01:24:29.090 --> 01:24:29.100 align:start position:0%
from we could work if I take that that
 
01:24:31.490 --> 01:24:31.500 align:start position:0%
much I mean I don't know what they do
 
01:24:35.149 --> 01:24:35.159 align:start position:0%
from the speaker and from Matt
 
01:24:38.390 --> 01:24:38.400 align:start position:0%
can speak himself but for this fall is
 
01:24:41.270 --> 01:24:41.280 align:start position:0%
that we would at least partially come
 
01:24:44.330 --> 01:24:44.340 align:start position:0%
forward with a group of legit of
 
01:24:47.090 --> 01:24:47.100 align:start position:0%
legislation proposed legislation
 
01:24:50.330 --> 01:24:50.340 align:start position:0%
that we could administer this in this
 
01:24:52.669 --> 01:24:52.679 align:start position:0%
next session coming up in this second
 
01:24:55.610 --> 01:24:55.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:59.450 --> 01:24:59.460 align:start position:0%
yeah I will say I
 
01:25:01.370 --> 01:25:01.380 align:start position:0%
I think that is not that is an option
 
01:25:03.530 --> 01:25:03.540 align:start position:0%
right I mean I think I think policies is
 
01:25:05.450 --> 01:25:05.460 align:start position:0%
another thing I think how it gets rolled
 
01:25:06.770 --> 01:25:06.780 align:start position:0%
out how
 
01:25:09.950 --> 01:25:09.960 align:start position:0%
uh you know cheers are briefed about
 
01:25:12.290 --> 01:25:12.300 align:start position:0%
like what the expectations are moving
 
01:25:13.729 --> 01:25:13.739 align:start position:0%
forward I think all of that I think
 
01:25:15.169 --> 01:25:15.179 align:start position:0%
those are recommendations that we can
 
01:25:16.490 --> 01:25:16.500 align:start position:0%
make and if it is
 
01:25:18.470 --> 01:25:18.480 align:start position:0%
something in you know if it is
 
01:25:20.630 --> 01:25:20.640 align:start position:0%
legislation then it's legislation but
 
01:25:24.669 --> 01:25:24.679 align:start position:0%
it's not necessarily okay right
 
01:25:27.950 --> 01:25:27.960 align:start position:0%
it was my hope when we started this up
 
01:25:29.810 --> 01:25:29.820 align:start position:0%
that we would I'd be able to do some
 
01:25:29.820 --> 01:25:31.610 align:start position:0%
that we would I'd be able to do some
sweeping

01:25:31.610 --> 01:25:31.620 align:start position:0%
sweeping
 
01:25:34.550 --> 01:25:34.560 align:start position:0%
activity to say you know you haven't met
 
01:25:34.560 --> 01:25:35.390 align:start position:0%
activity to say you know you haven't met
and

01:25:35.390 --> 01:25:35.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:25:38.990 --> 01:25:39.000 align:start position:0%
in uh in four years you're dead
 
01:25:41.450 --> 01:25:41.460 align:start position:0%
into that we have to have to legislate
 
01:25:47.810 --> 01:25:47.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:50.209 --> 01:25:50.219 align:start position:0%
right that's what I'm saying we have to
 
01:25:52.070 --> 01:25:52.080 align:start position:0%
legislate our way out of
 
01:25:55.310 --> 01:25:55.320 align:start position:0%
yes representative thank you Mr chairman
 
01:25:56.810 --> 01:25:56.820 align:start position:0%
Karen just brought up something else
 
01:25:58.250 --> 01:25:58.260 align:start position:0%
that made me stop and think about
 
01:26:00.830 --> 01:26:00.840 align:start position:0%
something else about the drafting
 
01:26:02.990 --> 01:26:03.000 align:start position:0%
um we are always reminded that we should
 
01:26:05.810 --> 01:26:05.820 align:start position:0%
be in recent history to bring in as much
 
01:26:08.090 --> 01:26:08.100 align:start position:0%
information we can for filing
 
01:26:11.030 --> 01:26:11.040 align:start position:0%
legislation for the drafters I think it
 
01:26:13.669 --> 01:26:13.679 align:start position:0%
would be helpful also for members to
 
01:26:16.610 --> 01:26:16.620 align:start position:0%
know what drafters can and can't do
 
01:26:18.290 --> 01:26:18.300 align:start position:0%
because they have restrictions on
 
01:26:20.390 --> 01:26:20.400 align:start position:0%
Guiding us and we need to know what
 
01:26:22.250 --> 01:26:22.260 align:start position:0%
those are so that we can guide the
 
01:26:25.250 --> 01:26:25.260 align:start position:0%
legislators in the process so that we
 
01:26:26.750 --> 01:26:26.760 align:start position:0%
don't have so many people bringing in
 
01:26:28.850 --> 01:26:28.860 align:start position:0%
very loose or almost
 
01:26:30.350 --> 01:26:30.360 align:start position:0%
pardon me for saying it almost
 
01:26:33.590 --> 01:26:33.600 align:start position:0%
meaningless legislation I drafting is
 
01:26:35.689 --> 01:26:35.699 align:start position:0%
critical right so I I think that's good
 
01:26:37.370 --> 01:26:37.380 align:start position:0%
I think that's a good idea I mean I
 
01:26:40.250 --> 01:26:40.260 align:start position:0%
think if Dave is available we could have
 
01:26:41.990 --> 01:26:42.000 align:start position:0%
a really good conversation with him
 
01:26:45.229 --> 01:26:45.239 align:start position:0%
about the drafting process up front and
 
01:26:47.330 --> 01:26:47.340 align:start position:0%
um you know some of it is sort of in the
 
01:26:49.370 --> 01:26:49.380 align:start position:0%
weeds for us but I think we need to just
 
01:26:51.950 --> 01:26:51.960 align:start position:0%
right dive into them talking to him
 
01:26:51.960 --> 01:26:53.450 align:start position:0%
right dive into them talking to him
earlier

01:26:53.450 --> 01:26:53.460 align:start position:0%
earlier
 
01:26:56.510 --> 01:26:56.520 align:start position:0%
uh he's a little gun shy about
 
01:26:58.729 --> 01:26:58.739 align:start position:0%
telling a legislator what they can and
 
01:27:00.890 --> 01:27:00.900 align:start position:0%
can't do
 
01:27:04.250 --> 01:27:04.260 align:start position:0%
anything right right because he he's not
 
01:27:05.930 --> 01:27:05.940 align:start position:0%
apt to at least right now
 
01:27:08.510 --> 01:27:08.520 align:start position:0%
with the current state of Direction he's
 
01:27:11.870 --> 01:27:11.880 align:start position:0%
not apt to say you really shouldn't do
 
01:27:14.750 --> 01:27:14.760 align:start position:0%
that you should do this instead he says
 
01:27:16.250 --> 01:27:16.260 align:start position:0%
that's what you want to do that's that's
 
01:27:19.790 --> 01:27:19.800 align:start position:0%
what we'll do so we need to find a way
 
01:27:22.010 --> 01:27:22.020 align:start position:0%
to get that direction that's why I'm
 
01:27:24.470 --> 01:27:24.480 align:start position:0%
thinking of a template that he could
 
01:27:26.750 --> 01:27:26.760 align:start position:0%
hand back to the legislator say and this
 
01:27:29.030 --> 01:27:29.040 align:start position:0%
is the template that
 
01:27:29.040 --> 01:27:31.010 align:start position:0%
is the template that
uh

01:27:31.010 --> 01:27:31.020 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:27:33.229 --> 01:27:33.239 align:start position:0%
that the speaker and the minority leader
 
01:27:35.810 --> 01:27:35.820 align:start position:0%
came up with whether they endure so put
 
01:27:37.790 --> 01:27:37.800 align:start position:0%
it that way so
 
01:27:41.510 --> 01:27:41.520 align:start position:0%
you ought to try to get your legislation
 
01:27:43.729 --> 01:27:43.739 align:start position:0%
fit Within These parameters
 
01:27:46.070 --> 01:27:46.080 align:start position:0%
and that I think that would be helpful
 
01:27:47.390 --> 01:27:47.400 align:start position:0%
because I think like I said I think he's
 
01:27:49.250 --> 01:27:49.260 align:start position:0%
a little gun-shy about
 
01:27:51.350 --> 01:27:51.360 align:start position:0%
being uh
 
01:27:52.970 --> 01:27:52.980 align:start position:0%
Clearinghouse if you will for
 
01:27:52.980 --> 01:27:55.189 align:start position:0%
Clearinghouse if you will for
legislation

01:27:55.189 --> 01:27:55.199 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
01:27:55.199 --> 01:27:59.330 align:start position:0%
legislation
right

01:27:59.330 --> 01:27:59.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:00.830 --> 01:28:00.840 align:start position:0%
hey John
 
01:28:04.370 --> 01:28:04.380 align:start position:0%
hey Mr chairman also building on that
 
01:28:06.910 --> 01:28:06.920 align:start position:0%
um what you can go through
 
01:28:09.950 --> 01:28:09.960 align:start position:0%
in terms of drafting you know
 
01:28:12.050 --> 01:28:12.060 align:start position:0%
um I think I agree with Karen that we
 
01:28:17.830 --> 01:28:17.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:19.729 --> 01:28:19.739 align:start position:0%
not doing that
 
01:28:22.430 --> 01:28:22.440 align:start position:0%
it's okay oh you're welcome
 
01:28:23.629 --> 01:28:23.639 align:start position:0%
um the
 
01:28:26.570 --> 01:28:26.580 align:start position:0%
I don't believe drafters can say to us
 
01:28:29.510 --> 01:28:29.520 align:start position:0%
oh gee we've had 48 bills already on
 
01:28:31.310 --> 01:28:31.320 align:start position:0%
Lollipops being allowed in the
 
01:28:33.890 --> 01:28:33.900 align:start position:0%
legislature or something like that
 
01:28:35.930 --> 01:28:35.940 align:start position:0%
um they can't tell us how many times we
 
01:28:37.850 --> 01:28:37.860 align:start position:0%
can go to research to find out how many
 
01:28:40.250 --> 01:28:40.260 align:start position:0%
times a bill has been so I think you'll
 
01:28:42.649 --> 01:28:42.659 align:start position:0%
be very helpful as Karen suggested to
 
01:28:44.629 --> 01:28:44.639 align:start position:0%
have Mr alaconis come in and talk with
 
01:28:47.629 --> 01:28:47.639 align:start position:0%
us about the processes he has the the
 
01:28:50.270 --> 01:28:50.280 align:start position:0%
drafters and the lawyers and researchers
 
01:28:52.250 --> 01:28:52.260 align:start position:0%
go through um just so everyone has a
 
01:28:53.990 --> 01:28:54.000 align:start position:0%
clear definition of what
 
01:28:56.750 --> 01:28:56.760 align:start position:0%
responsibilities we all have thank you
 
01:28:56.760 --> 01:28:59.510 align:start position:0%
responsibilities we all have thank you
yeah

01:28:59.510 --> 01:28:59.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:01.129 --> 01:29:01.139 align:start position:0%
yes ma'am
 
01:29:04.189 --> 01:29:04.199 align:start position:0%
thank you I I'd also like to add in that
 
01:29:04.199 --> 01:29:05.570 align:start position:0%
thank you I I'd also like to add in that
conversation

01:29:05.570 --> 01:29:05.580 align:start position:0%
conversation
 
01:29:07.430 --> 01:29:07.440 align:start position:0%
um just to at least start thinking about
 
01:29:09.890 --> 01:29:09.900 align:start position:0%
also what the approach to amendments
 
01:29:12.290 --> 01:29:12.300 align:start position:0%
will be like because I think with all
 
01:29:14.689 --> 01:29:14.699 align:start position:0%
these retained bills that we have
 
01:29:16.790 --> 01:29:16.800 align:start position:0%
um being brought back to the legislature
 
01:29:19.070 --> 01:29:19.080 align:start position:0%
I think that amendments for study
 
01:29:21.649 --> 01:29:21.659 align:start position:0%
committees and commissions might be a
 
01:29:23.209 --> 01:29:23.219 align:start position:0%
perceived easier way out of some of
 
01:29:25.070 --> 01:29:25.080 align:start position:0%
these sticky situations where folks
 
01:29:27.229 --> 01:29:27.239 align:start position:0%
aren't necessarily able to come into
 
01:29:29.149 --> 01:29:29.159 align:start position:0%
agreement so
 
01:29:30.649 --> 01:29:30.659 align:start position:0%
um just starting to get that on the
 
01:29:32.689 --> 01:29:32.699 align:start position:0%
table in our conversation with Mr
 
01:29:37.010 --> 01:29:37.020 align:start position:0%
alconus will be helpful too I think and
 
01:29:38.750 --> 01:29:38.760 align:start position:0%
and then one other thing is I'd like
 
01:29:41.390 --> 01:29:41.400 align:start position:0%
also for us to be able at that point to
 
01:29:45.950 --> 01:29:45.960 align:start position:0%
commit to him that um those of us in the
 
01:29:47.390 --> 01:29:47.400 align:start position:0%
minority office in the majority office
 
01:29:50.090 --> 01:29:50.100 align:start position:0%
will take some responsibility to to
 
01:29:52.430 --> 01:29:52.440 align:start position:0%
educate our caucuses on the template and
 
01:29:53.810 --> 01:29:53.820 align:start position:0%
on the questions that they should be
 
01:29:56.870 --> 01:29:56.880 align:start position:0%
asking before they go forward especially
 
01:30:01.129 --> 01:30:01.139 align:start position:0%
into that sort of retained Bill season
 
01:30:03.890 --> 01:30:03.900 align:start position:0%
a great idea why don't I suggest that
 
01:30:03.900 --> 01:30:04.910 align:start position:0%
a great idea why don't I suggest that
that

01:30:04.910 --> 01:30:04.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:30:08.229 --> 01:30:08.239 align:start position:0%
in conjunction with elephants
 
01:30:11.629 --> 01:30:11.639 align:start position:0%
pitch to us that we think about those of
 
01:30:13.970 --> 01:30:13.980 align:start position:0%
us who are going to work on this process
 
01:30:16.370 --> 01:30:16.380 align:start position:0%
that we include that that's part of the
 
01:30:16.380 --> 01:30:18.530 align:start position:0%
that we include that that's part of the
output

01:30:18.530 --> 01:30:18.540 align:start position:0%
output
 
01:30:20.629 --> 01:30:20.639 align:start position:0%
to what the expectations ought to be for
 
01:30:23.629 --> 01:30:23.639 align:start position:0%
the for the two caucuses to uh to how
 
01:30:25.209 --> 01:30:25.219 align:start position:0%
they should brief
 
01:30:28.010 --> 01:30:28.020 align:start position:0%
their members to what the expectations
 
01:30:32.209 --> 01:30:32.219 align:start position:0%
are that you okay with that yeah uh John
 
01:30:34.010 --> 01:30:34.020 align:start position:0%
where we are right now I'm gonna have to
 
01:30:36.950 --> 01:30:36.960 align:start position:0%
have to leave I have an appointment
 
01:30:36.960 --> 01:30:37.850 align:start position:0%
have to leave I have an appointment
um

01:30:37.850 --> 01:30:37.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:30:39.470 --> 01:30:39.480 align:start position:0%
we're uh
 
01:30:42.169 --> 01:30:42.179 align:start position:0%
you you can
 
01:30:46.070 --> 01:30:46.080 align:start position:0%
adjourn whatever you want but um we're
 
01:30:48.590 --> 01:30:48.600 align:start position:0%
going to ask uh Mr alakunas to come in
 
01:30:54.050 --> 01:30:54.060 align:start position:0%
and give us uh some a pre-briefing uh a
 
01:30:56.450 --> 01:30:56.460 align:start position:0%
handout ahead of time before next week
 
01:30:59.450 --> 01:30:59.460 align:start position:0%
but also be here next week to talk about
 
01:31:01.669 --> 01:31:01.679 align:start position:0%
what the what the starting document
 
01:31:03.890 --> 01:31:03.900 align:start position:0%
looks like for a template for
 
01:31:08.629 --> 01:31:08.639 align:start position:0%
legislators uh and uh and also to look
 
01:31:11.270 --> 01:31:11.280 align:start position:0%
at things like is this something that
 
01:31:13.610 --> 01:31:13.620 align:start position:0%
maybe Legend admin should be monitoring
 
01:31:17.209 --> 01:31:17.219 align:start position:0%
uh versus this committee uh
 
01:31:21.169 --> 01:31:21.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:23.810 --> 01:31:23.820 align:start position:0%
what what will be uh we just we were
 
01:31:25.490 --> 01:31:25.500 align:start position:0%
just mentioning for the for the two
 
01:31:28.669 --> 01:31:28.679 align:start position:0%
caucuses what guidance should be given
 
01:31:31.550 --> 01:31:31.560 align:start position:0%
to the the two caucuses as to what
 
01:31:34.610 --> 01:31:34.620 align:start position:0%
committee chair should be telling their
 
01:31:34.620 --> 01:31:35.570 align:start position:0%
committee chair should be telling their
members

01:31:35.570 --> 01:31:35.580 align:start position:0%
members
 
01:31:38.390 --> 01:31:38.400 align:start position:0%
uh about what the expectations are for
 
01:31:38.400 --> 01:31:39.950 align:start position:0%
uh about what the expectations are for
commissions

01:31:39.950 --> 01:31:39.960 align:start position:0%
commissions
 
01:31:41.629 --> 01:31:41.639 align:start position:0%
it's either to create the commissions or
 
01:31:44.629 --> 01:31:44.639 align:start position:0%
to be to be to pop be populating
 
01:31:44.639 --> 01:31:46.030 align:start position:0%
to be to be to pop be populating
commissions

01:31:46.030 --> 01:31:46.040 align:start position:0%
commissions
 
01:31:49.129 --> 01:31:49.139 align:start position:0%
we ought to be getting ready to create a
 
01:31:53.330 --> 01:31:53.340 align:start position:0%
script for our our chair people uh
 
01:31:55.669 --> 01:31:55.679 align:start position:0%
uh and what our expectations are for
 
01:31:57.410 --> 01:31:57.420 align:start position:0%
legislators that are going to serve on
 
01:32:00.169 --> 01:32:00.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:02.689 --> 01:32:02.699 align:start position:0%
as an aside we
 
01:32:05.209 --> 01:32:05.219 align:start position:0%
good suggestion Karen is we ought to
 
01:32:07.430 --> 01:32:07.440 align:start position:0%
figure out if there's a way we can limit
 
01:32:10.850 --> 01:32:10.860 align:start position:0%
the governor's appointments okay we
 
01:32:13.729 --> 01:32:13.739 align:start position:0%
should treat the governor's appointments
 
01:32:15.530 --> 01:32:15.540 align:start position:0%
and I'll say this if no one else will
 
01:32:17.990 --> 01:32:18.000 align:start position:0%
that because he might contaminate the
 
01:32:25.970 --> 01:32:25.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:25.980 --> 01:32:27.709 align:start position:0%
 
right

01:32:27.709 --> 01:32:27.719 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:32:27.719 --> 01:32:33.890 align:start position:0%
right
um

01:32:33.890 --> 01:32:33.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:37.189 --> 01:32:37.199 align:start position:0%
and uh it was just mentioned that uh we
 
01:32:39.410 --> 01:32:39.420 align:start position:0%
may need to do some amen amendments to
 
01:32:41.390 --> 01:32:41.400 align:start position:0%
commissions and what should the guidance
 
01:32:43.790 --> 01:32:43.800 align:start position:0%
be for those amendments
 
01:32:47.030 --> 01:32:47.040 align:start position:0%
yeah well uh at the with that I'm going
 
01:32:49.310 --> 01:32:49.320 align:start position:0%
to step out and turn it over to you
 
01:32:50.870 --> 01:32:50.880 align:start position:0%
that's right
 
01:32:52.850 --> 01:32:52.860 align:start position:0%
leave yeah um you said we were going to
 
01:32:55.490 --> 01:32:55.500 align:start position:0%
meet a little later next Monday
 
01:32:58.189 --> 01:32:58.199 align:start position:0%
um because rep evil has a yeah you're
 
01:32:59.990 --> 01:33:00.000 align:start position:0%
going to be a little bit late would it
 
01:33:02.810 --> 01:33:02.820 align:start position:0%
be I know 10 30 is a weird time but I
 
01:33:05.270 --> 01:33:05.280 align:start position:0%
could definitely be here by 10 30. 10
 
01:33:07.010 --> 01:33:07.020 align:start position:0%

01:33:45.229 --> 01:33:45.239 align:start position:0%
committees or commissions okay a they
 
01:33:47.149 --> 01:33:47.159 align:start position:0%
must have a Sunset date
 
01:33:50.570 --> 01:33:50.580 align:start position:0%
and whoever is the prime sponsor of that
 
01:33:54.470 --> 01:33:54.480 align:start position:0%
bill for that commission must be
 
01:33:58.070 --> 01:33:58.080 align:start position:0%
the first named member
 
01:33:59.570 --> 01:33:59.580 align:start position:0%
and you're gonna you'll see people
 
01:34:02.209 --> 01:34:02.219 align:start position:0%
starting to back off you know that
 
01:34:05.510 --> 01:34:05.520 align:start position:0%
so but and you you know it for sure when
 
01:34:07.189 --> 01:34:07.199 align:start position:0%
somebody says you you got to commit to
 
01:34:08.990 --> 01:34:09.000 align:start position:0%
it they're gonna oh maybe I don't want
 
01:34:11.810 --> 01:34:11.820 align:start position:0%
to do this so I've been pushing that at
 
01:34:13.970 --> 01:34:13.980 align:start position:0%
every chairs meeting and every bill that
 
01:34:17.030 --> 01:34:17.040 align:start position:0%
has come through uh Commerce from the
 
01:34:19.910 --> 01:34:19.920 align:start position:0%
Senate and the senator is testifying I
 
01:34:22.129 --> 01:34:22.139 align:start position:0%
asked them face to face are you willing
 
01:34:23.629 --> 01:34:23.639 align:start position:0%
to be the first name member on this
 
01:34:25.129 --> 01:34:25.139 align:start position:0%
commit on this committee or commission
 
01:34:27.649 --> 01:34:27.659 align:start position:0%
they say yes and every bill that I've
 
01:34:30.410 --> 01:34:30.420 align:start position:0%
asked them to amend to put a Sunset date
 
01:34:32.750 --> 01:34:32.760 align:start position:0%
in they have
 
01:34:36.169 --> 01:34:36.179 align:start position:0%
so if we spread the word when all our
 
01:34:37.729 --> 01:34:37.739 align:start position:0%
Canadian commission say hey guys you
 
01:34:39.410 --> 01:34:39.420 align:start position:0%
know we're trying to clean up the
 
01:34:41.870 --> 01:34:41.880 align:start position:0%
paperwork and this is the easy way to do
 
01:34:43.490 --> 01:34:43.500 align:start position:0%
it we do it proactively rather than
 
01:34:46.610 --> 01:34:46.620 align:start position:0%
reactively and I've had no pushback
 
01:34:50.209 --> 01:34:50.219 align:start position:0%
which is great it's been bipartisan
 
01:35:02.470 --> 01:35:02.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:05.030 --> 01:35:05.040 align:start position:0%
or maybe do you think we should offer
 
01:35:06.770 --> 01:35:06.780 align:start position:0%
him sort of jump in but before you leave
 
01:35:09.470 --> 01:35:09.480 align:start position:0%
should we offer both dates to Mr okunas
 
01:35:11.330 --> 01:35:11.340 align:start position:0%
and see when he can be here I mean I
 
01:35:14.090 --> 01:35:14.100 align:start position:0%
don't want to assume he can be here on
 
01:35:16.149 --> 01:35:16.159 align:start position:0%
next Monday it's not a ton of notice but
 
01:35:18.290 --> 01:35:18.300 align:start position:0%
oh he is you already he is available
 
01:35:22.910 --> 01:35:22.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:25.850 --> 01:35:25.860 align:start position:0%
all right Distributing
 
01:35:25.860 --> 01:35:27.290 align:start position:0%
all right Distributing
you

01:35:27.290 --> 01:35:27.300 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:35:28.669 --> 01:35:28.679 align:start position:0%
I know you won't be here I don't know
 
01:35:30.169 --> 01:35:30.179 align:start position:0%
how you feel about not being here for
 
01:35:40.910 --> 01:35:40.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:43.790 --> 01:35:43.800 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure if we backed in Spain maybe
 
01:35:45.290 --> 01:35:45.300 align:start position:0%
he can breathe
 
01:35:48.290 --> 01:35:48.300 align:start position:0%
maybe if you meet on Monday the 8th we
 
01:35:50.330 --> 01:35:50.340 align:start position:0%
and we feel would be beneficial that he
 
01:35:51.770 --> 01:35:51.780 align:start position:0%
could come back I'm not trying to over
 
01:35:53.090 --> 01:35:53.100 align:start position:0%
schedule his calendar but if you come
 
01:35:54.490 --> 01:35:54.500 align:start position:0%
back when
 
01:35:59.570 --> 01:35:59.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:03.290 --> 01:36:03.300 align:start position:0%
I'll be back a week from Monday okay and
 
01:36:10.070 --> 01:36:10.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:12.290 --> 01:36:12.300 align:start position:0%
and I know a lot of a lot of us reps are
 
01:36:14.090 --> 01:36:14.100 align:start position:0%
on pretty good for almost first name
 
01:36:16.209 --> 01:36:16.219 align:start position:0%
basis with
 
01:36:20.629 --> 01:36:20.639 align:start position:0%
Mr iaconis so it's not a problem to
 
01:36:20.639 --> 01:36:22.669 align:start position:0%
Mr iaconis so it's not a problem to
communicate

01:36:22.669 --> 01:36:22.679 align:start position:0%
communicate
 
01:36:25.669 --> 01:36:25.679 align:start position:0%
so I know I am
 
01:36:25.679 --> 01:36:27.590 align:start position:0%
so I know I am
okay

01:36:27.590 --> 01:36:27.600 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:37:28.010 --> 01:37:28.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:28.020 --> 01:37:29.229 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:37:29.229 --> 01:37:29.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:37:34.370 --> 01:37:34.380 align:start position:0%
all right so I know I don't
 
01:37:36.169 --> 01:37:36.179 align:start position:0%
know okay I'm not sure where we stand
 
01:37:38.930 --> 01:37:38.940 align:start position:0%
right now uh seeing as how the chair was
 
01:37:40.490 --> 01:37:40.500 align:start position:0%
vacated the chair
 
01:37:40.500 --> 01:37:42.110 align:start position:0%
vacated the chair
uh

01:37:42.110 --> 01:37:42.120 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:37:45.590 --> 01:37:45.600 align:start position:0%
what other issues would you like to
 
01:37:48.530 --> 01:37:48.540 align:start position:0%
address and I'm I'll just speak for
 
01:37:51.470 --> 01:37:51.480 align:start position:0%
myself I mean I I think we had a good
 
01:37:54.290 --> 01:37:54.300 align:start position:0%
discussion this morning about what next
 
01:37:56.390 --> 01:37:56.400 align:start position:0%
steps should be and I think
 
01:37:58.310 --> 01:37:58.320 align:start position:0%
um getting Mr Alchemist in here to talk
 
01:38:01.129 --> 01:38:01.139 align:start position:0%
with him about you know the process for
 
01:38:03.950 --> 01:38:03.960 align:start position:0%
drafting study committee bills
 
01:38:06.470 --> 01:38:06.480 align:start position:0%
um and commissions I think that that's a
 
01:38:07.850 --> 01:38:07.860 align:start position:0%
logical place
 
01:38:09.649 --> 01:38:09.659 align:start position:0%
for us to get going
 
01:38:11.330 --> 01:38:11.340 align:start position:0%
um but I don't I don't know that I feel
 
01:38:12.890 --> 01:38:12.900 align:start position:0%
like we've got a whole lot more to
 
01:38:14.870 --> 01:38:14.880 align:start position:0%
discuss is that template part of the
 
01:38:17.330 --> 01:38:17.340 align:start position:0%
going to be part of the discussion I
 
01:38:19.790 --> 01:38:19.800 align:start position:0%
think the hope is to to find out what
 
01:38:23.209 --> 01:38:23.219 align:start position:0%
what is being asked of members to
 
01:38:27.229 --> 01:38:27.239 align:start position:0%
include in drafting currently so that we
 
01:38:28.910 --> 01:38:28.920 align:start position:0%
then have that as sort of a baseline
 
01:38:32.450 --> 01:38:32.460 align:start position:0%
okay establish a baseline first yeah to
 
01:38:34.189 --> 01:38:34.199 align:start position:0%
understand what's what what are the
 
01:38:36.590 --> 01:38:36.600 align:start position:0%
standard operating procedures as
 
01:38:38.810 --> 01:38:38.820 align:start position:0%
I don't know that he has a template per
 
01:38:40.310 --> 01:38:40.320 align:start position:0%
se right now I think representative evil
 
01:38:42.050 --> 01:38:42.060 align:start position:0%
referred to it roughly as the idea he
 
01:38:43.810 --> 01:38:43.820 align:start position:0%
must have some sort of
 
01:38:45.830 --> 01:38:45.840 align:start position:0%
Baseline that he's working from but
 
01:38:47.990 --> 01:38:48.000 align:start position:0%
maybe it has to be turned into a
 
01:38:50.629 --> 01:38:50.639 align:start position:0%
template of sorts yeah I I agree I think
 
01:38:52.250 --> 01:38:52.260 align:start position:0%
they're they're template over there is
 
01:38:53.930 --> 01:38:53.940 align:start position:0%
kind of fluid
 
01:38:56.750 --> 01:38:56.760 align:start position:0%
and what I want to do is you know for us
 
01:38:59.330 --> 01:38:59.340 align:start position:0%
on these is when you have a committee or
 
01:39:01.490 --> 01:39:01.500 align:start position:0%
commission to set up set up a pretty
 
01:39:05.149 --> 01:39:05.159 align:start position:0%
hard and fast template with the options
 
01:39:07.310 --> 01:39:07.320 align:start position:0%
you know if you need an exception you
 
01:39:11.030 --> 01:39:11.040 align:start position:0%
must justify your
 
01:39:14.629 --> 01:39:14.639 align:start position:0%
exception and oh I had an interesting
 
01:39:17.090 --> 01:39:17.100 align:start position:0%
conversation with with Mr educonus about
 
01:39:17.100 --> 01:39:20.209 align:start position:0%
conversation with with Mr educonus about
notwithstanding

01:39:20.209 --> 01:39:20.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:22.430 --> 01:39:22.440 align:start position:0%
and he said
 
01:39:24.830 --> 01:39:24.840 align:start position:0%
it will probably take an act of the
 
01:39:26.209 --> 01:39:26.219 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court
 
01:39:28.370 --> 01:39:28.380 align:start position:0%
to get that
 
01:39:30.050 --> 01:39:30.060 align:start position:0%
put into
 
01:39:30.060 --> 01:39:31.930 align:start position:0%
put into
hard

01:39:31.930 --> 01:39:31.940 align:start position:0%
hard
 
01:39:35.750 --> 01:39:35.760 align:start position:0%
notwithstanding 1449 no he said it would
 
01:39:38.750 --> 01:39:38.760 align:start position:0%
probably take the Supreme Court to
 
01:39:41.090 --> 01:39:41.100 align:start position:0%
put their fish down on that
 
01:39:43.010 --> 01:39:43.020 align:start position:0%
