what what's gonna what we're gonna do
 
00:03:48.289 --> 00:03:48.299 align:start position:0%
um at once once we start at 11. uh so
 
00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 align:start position:0%
what I would like to do if I could just
 
00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:53.459 align:start position:0%
take a minute because
 
00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:56.700 align:start position:0%
um I know that a number of people are
 
00:03:59.809 --> 00:03:59.819 align:start position:0%
new on the committee and and candidly
 
00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:01.980 align:start position:0%
I'm new as chair of the committee and so
 
00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040 align:start position:0%
I just want to kind of go over things I
 
00:04:08.089 --> 00:04:08.099 align:start position:0%
think I've got this correct but if uh if
 
00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:10.560 align:start position:0%
I don't I will ask uh representative
 
00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060 align:start position:0%
Smith or representative Wallace to
 
00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:12.890 align:start position:0%
Smith or representative Wallace to
correct

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:12.900 align:start position:0%
correct
 
00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:15.060 align:start position:0%
so I I should say
 
00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:16.799 align:start position:0%
um at the beginning that representative
 
00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:19.799 align:start position:0%
Smith and I have spoken this morning
 
00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:21.720 align:start position:0%
um to basically try to you know see
 
00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:24.180 align:start position:0%
where we're both where both sides so to
 
00:04:27.409 --> 00:04:27.419 align:start position:0%
speak are and I think you'll uh you will
 
00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:30.840 align:start position:0%
be happy to see that uh we are
 
00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:33.240 align:start position:0%
um in in agreement on a great many of
 
00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:34.800 align:start position:0%
what we're about to what we're going to
 
00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:36.290 align:start position:0%
what we're about to what we're going to
discuss

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:36.300 align:start position:0%
discuss
 
00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:37.070 align:start position:0%
discuss
um

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:37.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:40.020 align:start position:0%
the um but just just to kind of go
 
00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:41.580 align:start position:0%
through this
 
00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:44.460 align:start position:0%
um where it appears to me
 
00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:45.950 align:start position:0%
um where it appears to me
um

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:45.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:49.320 align:start position:0%
um that there is disagreement I will
 
00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:51.720 align:start position:0%
call on a republican for the motion
 
00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:54.000 align:start position:0%
favoring my view on the bill I believe
 
00:04:57.469 --> 00:04:57.479 align:start position:0%
that's my priority as a chair uh we will
 
00:04:58.790 --> 00:04:58.800 align:start position:0%
have a full debate on the bill don't get
 
00:04:59.930 --> 00:04:59.940 align:start position:0%
me wrong everybody will have a full
 
00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:03.540 align:start position:0%
opportunity to have a debate on the bill
 
00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:06.240 align:start position:0%
um if there is a motion if if there is a
 
00:05:10.249 --> 00:05:10.259 align:start position:0%
motion uh on a bill of ought to pass and
 
00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:12.000 align:start position:0%
there's amendments we will deal with the
 
00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:15.000 align:start position:0%
Amendments first uh and then get to the
 
00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:16.460 align:start position:0%
main bill
 
00:05:19.969 --> 00:05:19.979 align:start position:0%
it's my understanding and again I ask my
 
00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:21.240 align:start position:0%
colleagues to correct me if I'm wrong
 
00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:22.550 align:start position:0%
colleagues to correct me if I'm wrong
that

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:22.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:24.500 align:start position:0%
um unless there's an objection
 
00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:27.240 align:start position:0%
amendments can be voted on by either a
 
00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:29.580 align:start position:0%
show of hands or a Voice vote whereas
 
00:05:33.469 --> 00:05:33.479 align:start position:0%
but once we get once we then get to the
 
00:05:35.689 --> 00:05:35.699 align:start position:0%
main motion either the amendment passes
 
00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:37.320 align:start position:0%
or it fails but then we get to the main
 
00:05:40.129 --> 00:05:40.139 align:start position:0%
bill that has to be a roll call vote um
 
00:05:41.529 --> 00:05:41.539 align:start position:0%
in all cases
 
00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:44.820 align:start position:0%
as I said my plan is to allow a full
 
00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:46.189 align:start position:0%
as I said my plan is to allow a full
debate

00:05:46.189 --> 00:05:46.199 align:start position:0%
debate
 
00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:49.380 align:start position:0%
um on on all the bills if whether we you
 
00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:51.840 align:start position:0%
know if we have an agreement or not
 
00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:52.550 align:start position:0%
know if we have an agreement or not
um

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:52.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:55.620 align:start position:0%
uh but I will I I will not allow a
 
00:05:57.950 --> 00:05:57.960 align:start position:0%
filibuster so that once everybody has
 
00:05:59.810 --> 00:05:59.820 align:start position:0%
had an opportunity to have to fully
 
00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:01.860 align:start position:0%
speak and have their say I will then
 
00:06:05.749 --> 00:06:05.759 align:start position:0%
call for uh for a vote uh if the first
 
00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:09.120 align:start position:0%
motion uh succeeds then that's sort of
 
00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:10.440 align:start position:0%
the end of the matter and that will be
 
00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:12.660 align:start position:0%
the recommendation uh of the committee
 
00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:15.120 align:start position:0%
if the motion fails there can then be
 
00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:16.740 align:start position:0%
another motion for example if there's a
 
00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:18.660 align:start position:0%
motion of itl and that fails there can
 
00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:20.820 align:start position:0%
then be a motion of ought to pass or
 
00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:24.960 align:start position:0%
some other motion if both uh if for
 
00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:29.160 align:start position:0%
example both emotion uh uh to itl fails
 
00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:31.080 align:start position:0%
and then a motion of ought to pass fails
 
00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:33.600 align:start position:0%
then the bill will go to the floor
 
00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:35.880 align:start position:0%
without recommendation and both sides
 
00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:38.220 align:start position:0%
May file a report explaining their
 
00:06:45.249 --> 00:06:45.259 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:47.520 align:start position:0%
there can be other motions such as
 
00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:50.340 align:start position:0%
retain or whatever yes for sure
 
00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:51.409 align:start position:0%
retain or whatever yes for sure
um

00:06:51.409 --> 00:06:51.419 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:06:56.390 --> 00:06:56.400 align:start position:0%
the um consent calendar uh uh requires
 
00:06:59.390 --> 00:06:59.400 align:start position:0%
as I understand it uh either unanimous
 
00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:02.460 align:start position:0%
or near unanimous agreement on a on a
 
00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:04.620 align:start position:0%
bill for it to be put on the consent
 
00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:08.220 align:start position:0%
calendar and it cannot have a fiscal
 
00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:11.520 align:start position:0%
impact unless it's a bill with a fiscal
 
00:07:14.029 --> 00:07:14.039 align:start position:0%
impact that we are voting itl because
 
00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:16.440 align:start position:0%
then there isn't any fiscal impact
 
00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:17.770 align:start position:0%
then there isn't any fiscal impact
uh

00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:17.780 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:21.240 align:start position:0%
reports uh the the uh
 
00:07:23.570 --> 00:07:23.580 align:start position:0%
the history on the practice of the house
 
00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:27.840 align:start position:0%
has been that um if uh if you are the
 
00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:31.380 align:start position:0%
one that moves a uh emotion
 
00:07:34.129 --> 00:07:34.139 align:start position:0%
um and that that then and uh you then
 
00:07:36.650 --> 00:07:36.660 align:start position:0%
you write the report on the motion if
 
00:07:38.210 --> 00:07:38.220 align:start position:0%
you're the one that's that seconds it
 
00:07:39.890 --> 00:07:39.900 align:start position:0%
then you if there's a debate on the
 
00:07:43.490 --> 00:07:43.500 align:start position:0%
floor you will do the the Parliamentary
 
00:07:45.529 --> 00:07:45.539 align:start position:0%
inquiry concerning it but that doesn't
 
00:07:47.089 --> 00:07:47.099 align:start position:0%
you know that's just the practice
 
00:07:50.870 --> 00:07:50.880 align:start position:0%
obviously if if uh if on my side of the
 
00:07:53.510 --> 00:07:53.520 align:start position:0%
aisle so to speak uh people you know I
 
00:07:54.830 --> 00:07:54.840 align:start position:0%
people want to have a discussion about
 
00:07:56.270 --> 00:07:56.280 align:start position:0%
that or want to have somebody else do it
 
00:07:57.650 --> 00:07:57.660 align:start position:0%
we can have a discussion about that and
 
00:07:59.210 --> 00:07:59.220 align:start position:0%
the same would be true
 
00:08:00.890 --> 00:08:00.900 align:start position:0%
um with representative Smith on the on
 
00:08:03.529 --> 00:08:03.539 align:start position:0%
the other side of the aisle
 
00:08:03.539 --> 00:08:04.670 align:start position:0%
the other side of the aisle
um

00:08:04.670 --> 00:08:04.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:06.469 --> 00:08:06.479 align:start position:0%
to just take a couple of seconds so
 
00:08:08.089 --> 00:08:08.099 align:start position:0%
people don't get
 
00:08:10.850 --> 00:08:10.860 align:start position:0%
um sort of overly concerned about
 
00:08:12.589 --> 00:08:12.599 align:start position:0%
reports especially if you haven't done
 
00:08:13.610 --> 00:08:13.620 align:start position:0%
it before
 
00:08:16.070 --> 00:08:16.080 align:start position:0%
these are not these reports are not term
 
00:08:19.010 --> 00:08:19.020 align:start position:0%
papers it's two or three sentences but
 
00:08:21.830 --> 00:08:21.840 align:start position:0%
basically explaining what the bill would
 
00:08:25.369 --> 00:08:25.379 align:start position:0%
would propose to do and why you either
 
00:08:27.290 --> 00:08:27.300 align:start position:0%
if your Society supports it or doesn't
 
00:08:29.089 --> 00:08:29.099 align:start position:0%
support it why you support the
 
00:08:31.129 --> 00:08:31.139 align:start position:0%
recommendation that that that has been
 
00:08:33.230 --> 00:08:33.240 align:start position:0%
made or if you're in the minority why
 
00:08:36.709 --> 00:08:36.719 align:start position:0%
you support another recommendation and
 
00:08:39.350 --> 00:08:39.360 align:start position:0%
then the the uh there has to be in the
 
00:08:41.209 --> 00:08:41.219 align:start position:0%
report it has to stay what the vote was
 
00:08:42.949 --> 00:08:42.959 align:start position:0%
of the committee
 
00:08:45.530 --> 00:08:45.540 align:start position:0%
um uh on the when the bill came to the
 
00:08:45.540 --> 00:08:46.730 align:start position:0%
um uh on the when the bill came to the
floor

00:08:46.730 --> 00:08:46.740 align:start position:0%
floor
 
00:08:46.740 --> 00:08:47.690 align:start position:0%
floor
um

00:08:47.690 --> 00:08:47.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:50.329 --> 00:08:50.339 align:start position:0%
the uh so and the other thing I would
 
00:08:53.030 --> 00:08:53.040 align:start position:0%
say is um if you have ques if you're
 
00:08:54.530 --> 00:08:54.540 align:start position:0%
assigned to write a report and you have
 
00:08:56.690 --> 00:08:56.700 align:start position:0%
questions and you're you know you're in
 
00:08:58.910 --> 00:08:58.920 align:start position:0%
you're on the majority party don't
 
00:09:01.009 --> 00:09:01.019 align:start position:0%
hesitate to contact me and talk to me
 
00:09:02.630 --> 00:09:02.640 align:start position:0%
about it and if you have if you're on
 
00:09:04.190 --> 00:09:04.200 align:start position:0%
the in the other party you should call
 
00:09:05.930 --> 00:09:05.940 align:start position:0%
Representative Smith and speak to her
 
00:09:07.190 --> 00:09:07.200 align:start position:0%
about it
 
00:09:10.790 --> 00:09:10.800 align:start position:0%
um we but we will both be reviewing the
 
00:09:12.350 --> 00:09:12.360 align:start position:0%
reports that are filed and then they
 
00:09:13.670 --> 00:09:13.680 align:start position:0%
eventually go to the speaker and he
 
00:09:15.170 --> 00:09:15.180 align:start position:0%
reviews them also
 
00:09:17.870 --> 00:09:17.880 align:start position:0%
um so I I guess I would say
 
00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:18.470 align:start position:0%
um so I I guess I would say
um

00:09:18.470 --> 00:09:18.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:21.889 --> 00:09:21.899 align:start position:0%
uh you know that
 
00:09:26.150 --> 00:09:26.160 align:start position:0%
my suggestion would be you want to uh
 
00:09:28.370 --> 00:09:28.380 align:start position:0%
you want to explain what the bill says
 
00:09:31.730 --> 00:09:31.740 align:start position:0%
and and your your sort of party or your
 
00:09:35.030 --> 00:09:35.040 align:start position:0%
your sides so to speak view on the bill
 
00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:36.050 align:start position:0%
your sides so to speak view on the bill
um

00:09:36.050 --> 00:09:36.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:38.389 --> 00:09:38.399 align:start position:0%
without my suggestion would be on books
 
00:09:41.570 --> 00:09:41.580 align:start position:0%
to both sides that it be in a kind of
 
00:09:43.610 --> 00:09:43.620 align:start position:0%
respectful and non-sort of
 
00:09:45.829 --> 00:09:45.839 align:start position:0%
confrontational manner
 
00:09:53.090 --> 00:09:53.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:55.310 --> 00:09:55.320 align:start position:0%
have we finished the report who do we
 
00:09:57.710 --> 00:09:57.720 align:start position:0%
submit it to submit it to uh you you
 
00:10:00.170 --> 00:10:00.180 align:start position:0%
submit it to me and and if you're and if
 
00:10:02.269 --> 00:10:02.279 align:start position:0%
you're if you're in the in the uh the
 
00:10:03.410 --> 00:10:03.420 align:start position:0%
Democrats would submit it to
 
00:10:05.570 --> 00:10:05.580 align:start position:0%
representative Smith at least first and
 
00:10:07.190 --> 00:10:07.200 align:start position:0%
then it would eventually it would come
 
00:10:09.170 --> 00:10:09.180 align:start position:0%
to me but it should go to her first for
 
00:10:10.790 --> 00:10:10.800 align:start position:0%
her review
 
00:10:13.370 --> 00:10:13.380 align:start position:0%
um and and this is uh what I would see
 
00:10:14.930 --> 00:10:14.940 align:start position:0%
what I'm going to suggest is the bills
 
00:10:17.329 --> 00:10:17.339 align:start position:0%
we're executing today I'm going to ask
 
00:10:19.490 --> 00:10:19.500 align:start position:0%
that if we have that the reports from
 
00:10:22.490 --> 00:10:22.500 align:start position:0%
both sides be in by the close of
 
00:10:24.650 --> 00:10:24.660 align:start position:0%
business this Friday
 
00:10:26.269 --> 00:10:26.279 align:start position:0%
um that will allow us to make sure that
 
00:10:28.490 --> 00:10:28.500 align:start position:0%
it can you know it can get onto the it
 
00:10:30.170 --> 00:10:30.180 align:start position:0%
can get into the record so that it can
 
00:10:33.130 --> 00:10:33.140 align:start position:0%
be put on uh it can be put in the
 
00:10:35.750 --> 00:10:35.760 align:start position:0%
uh the calendar for next week and then
 
00:10:37.850 --> 00:10:37.860 align:start position:0%
go on the next uh you might want to make
 
00:10:45.110 --> 00:10:45.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:48.290 --> 00:10:48.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:50.389 --> 00:10:50.399 align:start position:0%
well that's right no I'm sorry it would
 
00:10:52.009 --> 00:10:52.019 align:start position:0%
be the calendar for the following would
 
00:10:54.769 --> 00:10:54.779 align:start position:0%
be the count yeah so right for the next
 
00:10:56.389 --> 00:10:56.399 align:start position:0%
week would be Thursday into business
 
00:10:58.910 --> 00:10:58.920 align:start position:0%
right right but I guess I'd like to I
 
00:11:00.650 --> 00:11:00.660 align:start position:0%
mean just so that it gives us it gives
 
00:11:02.630 --> 00:11:02.640 align:start position:0%
everyone time for us to review it the
 
00:11:04.850 --> 00:11:04.860 align:start position:0%
speaker to review it and again I so I
 
00:11:06.650 --> 00:11:06.660 align:start position:0%
would I would request that you have the
 
00:11:09.230 --> 00:11:09.240 align:start position:0%
reports in by this Friday at the close
 
00:11:10.910 --> 00:11:10.920 align:start position:0%
of business that you're much more
 
00:11:12.970 --> 00:11:12.980 align:start position:0%
generous than that
 
00:11:15.590 --> 00:11:15.600 align:start position:0%
yes uh representative walls thank you
 
00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:16.730 align:start position:0%
yes uh representative walls thank you
chairman

00:11:16.730 --> 00:11:16.740 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
00:11:18.530 --> 00:11:18.540 align:start position:0%
um it might make sense since most of us
 
00:11:20.269 --> 00:11:20.279 align:start position:0%
are pretty organized we know the Motions
 
00:11:21.889 --> 00:11:21.899 align:start position:0%
were going to be make I would suggest
 
00:11:24.230 --> 00:11:24.240 align:start position:0%
that if you think you might be making a
 
00:11:26.150 --> 00:11:26.160 align:start position:0%
motion on a particular Bill have the
 
00:11:29.030 --> 00:11:29.040 align:start position:0%
blurb written written and with you that
 
00:11:30.710 --> 00:11:30.720 align:start position:0%
way you're off the hook when we're done
 
00:11:33.350 --> 00:11:33.360 align:start position:0%
we're done makes sense
 
00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:41.470 align:start position:0%
we're done makes sense
foreign

00:11:41.470 --> 00:11:41.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:45.410 --> 00:11:45.420 align:start position:0%
supports um is there a form available in
 
00:11:47.389 --> 00:11:47.399 align:start position:0%
the office or is it an online that we
 
00:11:50.590 --> 00:11:50.600 align:start position:0%
can obtain the form okay
 
00:11:53.750 --> 00:11:53.760 align:start position:0%
there used to be a form to do that it
 
00:11:55.610 --> 00:11:55.620 align:start position:0%
was a blue or a yellow sheet depending
 
00:11:57.889 --> 00:11:57.899 align:start position:0%
on the majority of minority but it can
 
00:12:00.710 --> 00:12:00.720 align:start position:0%
be you can just do a an email template
 
00:12:03.110 --> 00:12:03.120 align:start position:0%
and write your paragraph a couple of
 
00:12:05.269 --> 00:12:05.279 align:start position:0%
sentences touch on your points
 
00:12:06.949 --> 00:12:06.959 align:start position:0%
and you can just submit it directly like
 
00:12:10.009 --> 00:12:10.019 align:start position:0%
that without a form via email
 
00:12:11.990 --> 00:12:12.000 align:start position:0%
okay Caitlyn does have yes Caitlyn
 
00:12:13.970 --> 00:12:13.980 align:start position:0%
doesn't yeah and Mr Cherry do you want
 
00:12:16.190 --> 00:12:16.200 align:start position:0%
us to send the reports to you directly
 
00:12:18.829 --> 00:12:18.839 align:start position:0%
or to the to the secretary
 
00:12:21.650 --> 00:12:21.660 align:start position:0%
um uh actually I would I would copy both
 
00:12:23.870 --> 00:12:23.880 align:start position:0%
of us on it and again for the for the
 
00:12:26.329 --> 00:12:26.339 align:start position:0%
Democrats you should send your report to
 
00:12:29.150 --> 00:12:29.160 align:start position:0%
representative Smith alone first so that
 
00:12:30.889 --> 00:12:30.899 align:start position:0%
she gets to review it and make you know
 
00:12:33.170 --> 00:12:33.180 align:start position:0%
she may have suggested changes or
 
00:12:35.269 --> 00:12:35.279 align:start position:0%
whatever and only after only after she's
 
00:12:36.949 --> 00:12:36.959 align:start position:0%
done reviewing it should what should it
 
00:12:39.769 --> 00:12:39.779 align:start position:0%
come to me so with that so it goes you
 
00:12:41.210 --> 00:12:41.220 align:start position:0%
know each side sort of submits their
 
00:12:42.889 --> 00:12:42.899 align:start position:0%
reports through the chain of commands so
 
00:12:45.769 --> 00:12:45.779 align:start position:0%
to speak to to their side and then once
 
00:12:48.530 --> 00:12:48.540 align:start position:0%
their side is satisfied with it then it
 
00:12:51.290 --> 00:12:51.300 align:start position:0%
can then it'll it'll go uh go to the
 
00:12:52.790 --> 00:12:52.800 align:start position:0%
other go to me and then go to the
 
00:12:56.090 --> 00:12:56.100 align:start position:0%
speaker anybody have any questions on on
 
00:12:58.370 --> 00:12:58.380 align:start position:0%
any of that
 
00:13:01.430 --> 00:13:01.440 align:start position:0%
all right um then first I'm going to
 
00:13:04.150 --> 00:13:04.160 align:start position:0%
turn to uh
 
00:13:06.650 --> 00:13:06.660 align:start position:0%
hv67fn relative to the right to review
 
00:13:09.949 --> 00:13:09.959 align:start position:0%
source code of software in criminal
 
00:13:12.050 --> 00:13:12.060 align:start position:0%
cases and I will recognize
 
00:13:15.470 --> 00:13:15.480 align:start position:0%
representative Stapleton for a motion
 
00:13:20.629 --> 00:13:20.639 align:start position:0%
I move Ito on HB 67.
 
00:13:24.430 --> 00:13:24.440 align:start position:0%
um believing that the
 
00:13:27.170 --> 00:13:27.180 align:start position:0%
let me just ask is there a second
 
00:13:29.389 --> 00:13:29.399 align:start position:0%
the second of Alexander seconds
 
00:13:31.430 --> 00:13:31.440 align:start position:0%
all right yes discussion uh
 
00:13:35.449 --> 00:13:35.459 align:start position:0%
representative yeah I think it's uh
 
00:13:40.069 --> 00:13:40.079 align:start position:0%
two fine and too narrow uh of a uh of a
 
00:13:43.370 --> 00:13:43.380 align:start position:0%
need and not many people uh are capable
 
00:13:46.310 --> 00:13:46.320 align:start position:0%
of uh looking into source code without
 
00:13:49.850 --> 00:13:49.860 align:start position:0%
third party assistance and I I just it
 
00:13:51.470 --> 00:13:51.480 align:start position:0%
doesn't make sense it doesn't seem
 
00:13:55.490 --> 00:13:55.500 align:start position:0%
practicable for Value uh in in criminal
 
00:13:58.670 --> 00:13:58.680 align:start position:0%
cases of evidence right other other
 
00:14:02.030 --> 00:14:02.040 align:start position:0%
people any other comments on this of any
 
00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:03.350 align:start position:0%
people any other comments on this of any
kind

00:14:03.350 --> 00:14:03.360 align:start position:0%
kind
 
00:14:05.930 --> 00:14:05.940 align:start position:0%
um I I guess I would just say uh very
 
00:14:07.310 --> 00:14:07.320 align:start position:0%
briefly that
 
00:14:10.790 --> 00:14:10.800 align:start position:0%
um as was pointed out at the hearing uh
 
00:14:14.030 --> 00:14:14.040 align:start position:0%
the courts have authority to order the
 
00:14:15.889 --> 00:14:15.899 align:start position:0%
production of source codes in particular
 
00:14:18.290 --> 00:14:18.300 align:start position:0%
cases if there's some basis to believe
 
00:14:20.389 --> 00:14:20.399 align:start position:0%
that there's a problem with Source codes
 
00:14:22.670 --> 00:14:22.680 align:start position:0%
this bill would sort of make it like
 
00:14:24.829 --> 00:14:24.839 align:start position:0%
just sort of automatic that Source codes
 
00:14:27.230 --> 00:14:27.240 align:start position:0%
are available it would as as was stated
 
00:14:29.449 --> 00:14:29.459 align:start position:0%
at the hearing it would present issues
 
00:14:32.870 --> 00:14:32.880 align:start position:0%
of uh of uh intellectual property rights
 
00:14:35.690 --> 00:14:35.700 align:start position:0%
of of people who who own the source code
 
00:14:37.910 --> 00:14:37.920 align:start position:0%
so to speak third parties so I think it
 
00:14:39.470 --> 00:14:39.480 align:start position:0%
I think representative stapleton's
 
00:14:41.569 --> 00:14:41.579 align:start position:0%
motion is very well taken
 
00:14:44.689 --> 00:14:44.699 align:start position:0%
um uh other people anyone else have any
 
00:14:45.949 --> 00:14:45.959 align:start position:0%
comments on
 
00:14:48.290 --> 00:14:48.300 align:start position:0%
are we ready for a vote
 
00:14:52.189 --> 00:14:52.199 align:start position:0%
all right uh then I would uh
 
00:14:54.650 --> 00:14:54.660 align:start position:0%
ask for a roll call vote on this and ask
 
00:14:56.210 --> 00:14:56.220 align:start position:0%
the clerk if she would please call the
 
00:14:56.220 --> 00:14:58.730 align:start position:0%
the clerk if she would please call the
roll

00:14:58.730 --> 00:14:58.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:01.069 --> 00:15:01.079 align:start position:0%
on the motion of itl for house bill
 
00:15:01.079 --> 00:15:04.550 align:start position:0%

00:16:16.189 --> 00:16:16.199 align:start position:0%
right and um
 
00:16:29.930 --> 00:16:29.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:34.449 --> 00:16:34.459 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:39.290 --> 00:16:39.300 align:start position:0%
so um it's a 20-0 vote my uh although it
 
00:16:42.290 --> 00:16:42.300 align:start position:0%
has an FN since it's an itl motion I
 
00:16:43.670 --> 00:16:43.680 align:start position:0%
think it can go on the consent calendar
 
00:16:46.430 --> 00:16:46.440 align:start position:0%
does anybody have any uh objection to it
 
00:16:48.470 --> 00:16:48.480 align:start position:0%
going on consent
 
00:16:51.410 --> 00:16:51.420 align:start position:0%
right so we'll put that on consent
 
00:16:51.420 --> 00:16:52.730 align:start position:0%
right so we'll put that on consent
um

00:16:52.730 --> 00:16:52.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:57.230 --> 00:16:57.240 align:start position:0%
next uh and this this we take up HB 290
 
00:16:59.150 --> 00:16:59.160 align:start position:0%
and I guess
 
00:17:02.410 --> 00:17:02.420 align:start position:0%
before we have before I recognize
 
00:17:05.390 --> 00:17:05.400 align:start position:0%
representative Wallace for a motion on
 
00:17:07.850 --> 00:17:07.860 align:start position:0%
that I want to bring something to the
 
00:17:10.789 --> 00:17:10.799 align:start position:0%
attack this was this was one of the
 
00:17:12.409 --> 00:17:12.419 align:start position:0%
bills that um
 
00:17:14.449 --> 00:17:14.459 align:start position:0%
there I want to spoke to representative
 
00:17:16.789 --> 00:17:16.799 align:start position:0%
Smith there was uh it appeared that
 
00:17:20.390 --> 00:17:20.400 align:start position:0%
there would be a disagreement between
 
00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:21.110 align:start position:0%
there would be a disagreement between
um

00:17:21.110 --> 00:17:21.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:17:23.990 --> 00:17:24.000 align:start position:0%
the majority and the minority
 
00:17:27.590 --> 00:17:27.600 align:start position:0%
um the the majority was inclined to
 
00:17:30.350 --> 00:17:30.360 align:start position:0%
recommend this ought to pass
 
00:17:32.450 --> 00:17:32.460 align:start position:0%
and I apologize for this for not
 
00:17:35.390 --> 00:17:35.400 align:start position:0%
catching this earlier but here is what
 
00:17:38.270 --> 00:17:38.280 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm very concerned about as if you
 
00:17:40.310 --> 00:17:40.320 align:start position:0%
look at this bill which seemed like a
 
00:17:44.029 --> 00:17:44.039 align:start position:0%
very simple bill it proposed to allow
 
00:17:49.190 --> 00:17:49.200 align:start position:0%
constables to make service of process of
 
00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:50.450 align:start position:0%
constables to make service of process of
Ritz

00:17:50.450 --> 00:17:50.460 align:start position:0%
Ritz
 
00:17:53.930 --> 00:17:53.940 align:start position:0%
and that were in excess of 75 dollars
 
00:17:56.390 --> 00:17:56.400 align:start position:0%
and I think all of all of us at least on
 
00:17:57.770 --> 00:17:57.780 align:start position:0%
my side of the aisle sort of thought
 
00:17:59.330 --> 00:17:59.340 align:start position:0%
what's the big deal if we change this
 
00:18:01.730 --> 00:18:01.740 align:start position:0%
there didn't seem to be any particular
 
00:18:04.250 --> 00:18:04.260 align:start position:0%
opposition to this bill as opposed to
 
00:18:07.610 --> 00:18:07.620 align:start position:0%
187 which we'll get to in a moment
 
00:18:10.570 --> 00:18:10.580 align:start position:0%
um the the thing that caught my eye
 
00:18:14.690 --> 00:18:14.700 align:start position:0%
about four o'clock this morning was the
 
00:18:17.870 --> 00:18:17.880 align:start position:0%
language in the bill that says
 
00:18:20.270 --> 00:18:20.280 align:start position:0%
the the
 
00:18:22.909 --> 00:18:22.919 align:start position:0%
um the Constable shell
 
00:18:26.630 --> 00:18:26.640 align:start position:0%
and so then the question became what is
 
00:18:30.110 --> 00:18:30.120 align:start position:0%
a constable so after doing after uh
 
00:18:31.669 --> 00:18:31.679 align:start position:0%
calling Richard head at the judicial
 
00:18:34.490 --> 00:18:34.500 align:start position:0%
branch and doing some research myself I
 
00:18:38.570 --> 00:18:38.580 align:start position:0%
came across RSA 105.3 and I'm quoting it
 
00:18:41.750 --> 00:18:41.760 align:start position:0%
to you now it says all police officers
 
00:18:44.830 --> 00:18:44.840 align:start position:0%
are by virtue of their appointment
 
00:18:49.549 --> 00:18:49.559 align:start position:0%
constables and conservators of the Peace
 
00:18:51.950 --> 00:18:51.960 align:start position:0%
um what that means it seems to me is
 
00:18:54.529 --> 00:18:54.539 align:start position:0%
that police officers are constables and
 
00:18:58.070 --> 00:18:58.080 align:start position:0%
if we were to pass this bill we would be
 
00:18:59.470 --> 00:18:59.480 align:start position:0%
saying that
 
00:19:02.270 --> 00:19:02.280 align:start position:0%
police officers could be ordered
 
00:19:05.750 --> 00:19:05.760 align:start position:0%
presumably at the request of a party to
 
00:19:09.350 --> 00:19:09.360 align:start position:0%
serve Ritz that would be above seventy
 
00:19:12.230 --> 00:19:12.240 align:start position:0%
five dollars so presumably a lawyer
 
00:19:14.570 --> 00:19:14.580 align:start position:0%
instead of going to the sheriff could go
 
00:19:17.390 --> 00:19:17.400 align:start position:0%
to a police officer with a writ for
 
00:19:19.370 --> 00:19:19.380 align:start position:0%
three and a three million dollar civil
 
00:19:23.090 --> 00:19:23.100 align:start position:0%
suit and say you have to serve this rip
 
00:19:26.870 --> 00:19:26.880 align:start position:0%
I think if we were to pass this we would
 
00:19:29.810 --> 00:19:29.820 align:start position:0%
be effectively nullifying what I think
 
00:19:32.930 --> 00:19:32.940 align:start position:0%
will would likely be a motion to itl 187
 
00:19:36.470 --> 00:19:36.480 align:start position:0%
which is the next one so my suggestion
 
00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:37.549 align:start position:0%
which is the next one so my suggestion
is

00:19:37.549 --> 00:19:37.559 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:19:40.610 --> 00:19:40.620 align:start position:0%
that um we should
 
00:19:43.970 --> 00:19:43.980 align:start position:0%
we should join with our colleagues on
 
00:19:45.470 --> 00:19:45.480 align:start position:0%
the uh I'm speaking to the Republicans
 
00:19:47.029 --> 00:19:47.039 align:start position:0%
here joined with our colleagues on the
 
00:19:50.029 --> 00:19:50.039 align:start position:0%
other side of the aisle in moving this
 
00:19:53.690 --> 00:19:53.700 align:start position:0%
be itl but I'm happy if people have a
 
00:19:55.310 --> 00:19:55.320 align:start position:0%
different view on it I'm happy I don't
 
00:19:56.990 --> 00:19:57.000 align:start position:0%
want to you know that's that's my view
 
00:19:58.490 --> 00:19:58.500 align:start position:0%
if people have a different view we
 
00:20:02.270 --> 00:20:02.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:05.270 --> 00:20:05.280 align:start position:0%
all right so then I would entertain
 
00:20:12.770 --> 00:20:12.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:15.049 --> 00:20:15.059 align:start position:0%
you have a motion on that or no
 
00:20:18.289 --> 00:20:18.299 align:start position:0%
so moved right uh we have a second
 
00:20:21.710 --> 00:20:21.720 align:start position:0%
uh second all right any further
 
00:20:26.150 --> 00:20:26.160 align:start position:0%
discussion on uh House Bill 290
 
00:20:28.430 --> 00:20:28.440 align:start position:0%
and as I say I apologize to my
 
00:20:29.810 --> 00:20:29.820 align:start position:0%
colleagues I should have caught this
 
00:20:31.789 --> 00:20:31.799 align:start position:0%
earlier and I didn't and uh but I'm glad
 
00:20:34.130 --> 00:20:34.140 align:start position:0%
I at least I'm glad I caught it at least
 
00:20:36.890 --> 00:20:36.900 align:start position:0%
before we voted so the
 
00:20:38.330 --> 00:20:38.340 align:start position:0%
it looks like there's no further
 
00:20:41.049 --> 00:20:41.059 align:start position:0%
discussion so then on the motion for itl
 
00:20:44.570 --> 00:20:44.580 align:start position:0%
on House Bill 290 I think we're ready
 
00:20:47.029 --> 00:20:47.039 align:start position:0%
for a vote
 
00:20:49.549 --> 00:20:49.559 align:start position:0%

chairman Lin yes
 
00:21:40.789 --> 00:21:40.799 align:start position:0%
the motion of itl passes 20-0
 
00:21:44.330 --> 00:21:44.340 align:start position:0%
and again is there any reason that this
 
00:21:45.770 --> 00:21:45.780 align:start position:0%
cannot go on the consent calendar
 
00:21:49.730 --> 00:21:49.740 align:start position:0%
anybody have an objection to that
 
00:21:52.190 --> 00:21:52.200 align:start position:0%
all right so
 
00:21:53.930 --> 00:21:53.940 align:start position:0%
um it was seconded by representative
 
00:21:53.940 --> 00:21:56.270 align:start position:0%
um it was seconded by representative
Tripp

00:21:56.270 --> 00:21:56.280 align:start position:0%
Tripp
 
00:21:56.280 --> 00:21:58.130 align:start position:0%
Tripp
um

00:21:58.130 --> 00:21:58.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:22:00.350 --> 00:22:00.360 align:start position:0%
and so it will be we'll place that on
 
00:22:02.390 --> 00:22:02.400 align:start position:0%
the uh consent calendar
 
00:22:04.190 --> 00:22:04.200 align:start position:0%
all right next
 
00:22:12.529 --> 00:22:12.539 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:12.539 --> 00:22:14.529 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:22:14.529 --> 00:22:14.539 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
00:22:17.149 --> 00:22:17.159 align:start position:0%
I put them together because it's a
 
00:22:25.130 --> 00:22:25.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:27.549 --> 00:22:27.559 align:start position:0%
s for bills that we're expecting today
 
00:22:30.169 --> 00:22:30.179 align:start position:0%
oh it didn't work I mean I'm sorry it's
 
00:22:33.049 --> 00:22:33.059 align:start position:0%
I see where it is okay okay all right
 
00:22:33.059 --> 00:22:34.669 align:start position:0%
I see where it is okay okay all right
so

00:22:34.669 --> 00:22:34.679 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:22:37.730 --> 00:22:37.740 align:start position:0%
HP 187 I I put those next to each other
 
00:22:38.990 --> 00:22:39.000 align:start position:0%
because they deal with really the same
 
00:22:41.690 --> 00:22:41.700 align:start position:0%
subject matter effectively so
 
00:22:45.230 --> 00:22:45.240 align:start position:0%
um HB 187 permitting a police uh Chief
 
00:22:46.789 --> 00:22:46.799 align:start position:0%
or other designated law enforcement
 
00:22:49.850 --> 00:22:49.860 align:start position:0%
officer to serve process I recognize
 
00:22:52.010 --> 00:22:52.020 align:start position:0%
recognize representative Stapleton for a
 
00:22:52.020 --> 00:22:53.870 align:start position:0%
recognize representative Stapleton for a
motion

00:22:53.870 --> 00:22:53.880 align:start position:0%

00:23:35.630 --> 00:23:35.640 align:start position:0%
remain as it is now uh with the sheriff

um hang on one second
 
00:25:14.450 --> 00:25:14.460 align:start position:0%

to all right hang on let me just find
 
00:25:16.380 --> 00:25:17.570 align:start position:0%
to all right hang on let me just find
the

00:25:17.570 --> 00:25:17.580 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:25:17.580 --> 00:25:21.590 align:start position:0%
the
Amendment

00:25:21.590 --> 00:25:21.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:24.789 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:25:24.789 --> 00:25:24.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:27.370 --> 00:25:27.380 align:start position:0%
we're gonna vote on the on the uh
 
00:25:29.810 --> 00:25:29.820 align:start position:0%
Amendment first so
 
00:25:32.570 --> 00:25:32.580 align:start position:0%
um I have Amendment uh 116h everybody
 
00:25:34.730 --> 00:25:34.740 align:start position:0%
should have a copy of that
 
00:25:37.430 --> 00:25:37.440 align:start position:0%
it's a very
 
00:25:39.950 --> 00:25:39.960 align:start position:0%
um minor Amendment this um
 
00:25:43.909 --> 00:25:43.919 align:start position:0%
essentially takes out of existing law
 
00:25:46.610 --> 00:25:46.620 align:start position:0%
the subsection B
 
00:25:50.149 --> 00:25:50.159 align:start position:0%
in 464
 
00:25:54.710 --> 00:25:54.720 align:start position:0%
D colon seven Roman numeral
 
00:25:54.720 --> 00:25:56.510 align:start position:0%
D colon seven Roman numeral
um

00:25:56.510 --> 00:25:56.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:56.520 --> 00:25:58.669 align:start position:0%
um
uh

00:25:58.669 --> 00:25:58.679 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:25:58.679 --> 00:26:00.649 align:start position:0%
uh
three

00:26:00.649 --> 00:26:00.659 align:start position:0%
three
 
00:26:00.659 --> 00:26:02.210 align:start position:0%
three
um

00:26:02.210 --> 00:26:02.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:07.669 --> 00:26:07.679 align:start position:0%
uh to read as follows it basically
 
00:26:09.769 --> 00:26:09.779 align:start position:0%
right now in existing law there's a
 
00:26:12.649 --> 00:26:12.659 align:start position:0%
sections a b c
 
00:26:12.659 --> 00:26:13.549 align:start position:0%
sections a b c
um

00:26:13.549 --> 00:26:13.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:15.409 --> 00:26:15.419 align:start position:0%
D and E
 
00:26:18.110 --> 00:26:18.120 align:start position:0%
this proposes to a to
 
00:26:20.510 --> 00:26:20.520 align:start position:0%
remove what is referred to as subsection
 
00:26:24.590 --> 00:26:24.600 align:start position:0%
B and is in uh brackets omitted and just
 
00:26:32.269 --> 00:26:32.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:34.669 --> 00:26:34.679 align:start position:0%
I move that Amendment and
 
00:26:37.789 --> 00:26:37.799 align:start position:0%
um yeah I think you're oh that's right
 
00:26:42.230 --> 00:26:42.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:45.950 --> 00:26:45.960 align:start position:0%
yes sir just a point of clarification so
 
00:26:48.110 --> 00:26:48.120 align:start position:0%
what the paragraph that reads the
 
00:26:51.010 --> 00:26:51.020 align:start position:0%
agreement is dated would become
 
00:26:55.070 --> 00:26:55.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:57.230 --> 00:26:57.240 align:start position:0%
yes it would be that's right that would
 
00:27:01.730 --> 00:27:01.740 align:start position:0%
become uh B that's right yes
 
00:27:04.610 --> 00:27:04.620 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
00:27:09.169 --> 00:27:09.179 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:12.110 --> 00:27:12.120 align:start position:0%
I I actually and of course this was not
 
00:27:13.669 --> 00:27:13.679 align:start position:0%
exactly the most interesting thing I've
 
00:27:15.830 --> 00:27:15.840 align:start position:0%
ever done is
 
00:27:17.450 --> 00:27:17.460 align:start position:0%
um trace the legislative docket of the
 
00:27:18.950 --> 00:27:18.960 align:start position:0%
bill and it appears what happened is
 
00:27:21.169 --> 00:27:21.179 align:start position:0%
simply that there's a drafting error
 
00:27:22.610 --> 00:27:22.620 align:start position:0%
during a
 
00:27:24.350 --> 00:27:24.360 align:start position:0%
conference committee report because the
 
00:27:25.490 --> 00:27:25.500 align:start position:0%
House and Senate passed different
 
00:27:28.010 --> 00:27:28.020 align:start position:0%
versions up and then this was supposed
 
00:27:29.450 --> 00:27:29.460 align:start position:0%
probably should it would have been
 
00:27:31.190 --> 00:27:31.200 align:start position:0%
normally been caught in the enrolled
 
00:27:32.630 --> 00:27:32.640 align:start position:0%
Bill process but for whatever reason
 
00:27:34.070 --> 00:27:34.080 align:start position:0%
that particular
 
00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:35.090 align:start position:0%
that particular
uh

00:27:35.090 --> 00:27:35.100 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:27:36.950 --> 00:27:36.960 align:start position:0%
this particular problem fell through the
 
00:27:38.930 --> 00:27:38.940 align:start position:0%
cracks and the actually the conference
 
00:27:40.730 --> 00:27:40.740 align:start position:0%
committee report you know
 
00:27:43.970 --> 00:27:43.980 align:start position:0%
skip straight from B to D without that
 
00:27:46.549 --> 00:27:46.559 align:start position:0%
uh little emitted thing in there or
 
00:27:48.289 --> 00:27:48.299 align:start position:0%
anything so
 
00:27:50.269 --> 00:27:50.279 align:start position:0%
we're just correcting minor technical
 
00:27:51.529 --> 00:27:51.539 align:start position:0%
error that you know should have been
 
00:27:51.539 --> 00:27:52.310 align:start position:0%
error that you know should have been
caught

00:27:52.310 --> 00:27:52.320 align:start position:0%
caught
 
00:27:54.950 --> 00:27:54.960 align:start position:0%
earlier in the process but better late
 
00:27:57.830 --> 00:27:57.840 align:start position:0%
than never so
 
00:27:57.840 --> 00:27:58.909 align:start position:0%
than never so
any

00:27:58.909 --> 00:27:58.919 align:start position:0%
any
 
00:28:01.370 --> 00:28:01.380 align:start position:0%
um any other comments on
 
00:28:06.710 --> 00:28:06.720 align:start position:0%
uh the amendment 116 to HB 162. so are
 
00:28:09.470 --> 00:28:09.480 align:start position:0%
you ready for the question
 
00:28:12.950 --> 00:28:12.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:15.049 --> 00:28:15.059 align:start position:0%
well sex all right are we ready for the
 
00:28:16.669 --> 00:28:16.679 align:start position:0%
question so we can do this by Voice vote
 
00:28:19.430 --> 00:28:19.440 align:start position:0%
all those in favor say aye aye any
 
00:28:19.440 --> 00:28:20.630 align:start position:0%
all those in favor say aye aye any
opposed

00:28:20.630 --> 00:28:20.640 align:start position:0%
opposed
 
00:28:23.510 --> 00:28:23.520 align:start position:0%
all right so now we move to the main
 
00:28:26.570 --> 00:28:26.580 align:start position:0%
motion of uh
 
00:28:29.630 --> 00:28:29.640 align:start position:0%
ought to pass as with this amendment
 
00:28:32.269 --> 00:28:32.279 align:start position:0%
um you know are we
 
00:28:34.250 --> 00:28:34.260 align:start position:0%
is there any further discussion anybody
 
00:28:36.710 --> 00:28:36.720 align:start position:0%

00:30:31.789 --> 00:30:31.799 align:start position:0%
case uh that went
 
00:30:34.490 --> 00:30:34.500 align:start position:0%
through the Supreme Court and they
 
00:30:38.450 --> 00:30:38.460 align:start position:0%
determined that it was constitutional to
 
00:30:41.990 --> 00:30:42.000 align:start position:0%
limit protesting as long as it was
 
00:30:45.710 --> 00:30:45.720 align:start position:0%
um the scope of it was was clear and
 
00:30:47.330 --> 00:30:47.340 align:start position:0%
that you were still allowing protesting
 
00:30:48.889 --> 00:30:48.899 align:start position:0%
somewhere else and so it was well
 
00:30:51.409 --> 00:30:51.419 align:start position:0%
defined that it couldn't you know be in
 
00:30:53.149 --> 00:30:53.159 align:start position:0%
front of a residence then it was
 
00:30:54.529 --> 00:30:54.539 align:start position:0%
considered that it was an
 
00:30:54.539 --> 00:30:57.289 align:start position:0%
considered that it was an
unconstitutional

00:30:57.289 --> 00:30:57.299 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional
 
00:30:59.690 --> 00:30:59.700 align:start position:0%
yes uh representative Horrigan well
 
00:31:01.490 --> 00:31:01.500 align:start position:0%
something happened a lot we were being
 
00:31:03.470 --> 00:31:03.480 align:start position:0%
asked to legislate on the basis of a
 
00:31:06.470 --> 00:31:06.480 align:start position:0%
single anecdote and um
 
00:31:08.870 --> 00:31:08.880 align:start position:0%
I was not necessarily confident that
 
00:31:11.450 --> 00:31:11.460 align:start position:0%
everything the proponents of this Bill
 
00:31:13.570 --> 00:31:13.580 align:start position:0%
said was necessarily 100 percent
 
00:31:15.710 --> 00:31:15.720 align:start position:0%
accurate I mean even
 
00:31:18.730 --> 00:31:18.740 align:start position:0%
so so uh in any case
 
00:31:20.930 --> 00:31:20.940 align:start position:0%
and even if everything you said was
 
00:31:20.940 --> 00:31:21.830 align:start position:0%
and even if everything you said was
correct

00:31:21.830 --> 00:31:21.840 align:start position:0%
correct
 
00:31:23.570 --> 00:31:23.580 align:start position:0%
um I'm not sure if it's improperly
 
00:31:25.789 --> 00:31:25.799 align:start position:0%
handled and we should and we would have
 
00:31:27.649 --> 00:31:27.659 align:start position:0%
needed like a wider range of instances
 
00:31:29.930 --> 00:31:29.940 align:start position:0%
before tampering with the law of my
 
00:31:29.940 --> 00:31:31.730 align:start position:0%
before tampering with the law of my
opinions

00:31:31.730 --> 00:31:31.740 align:start position:0%
opinions
 
00:31:33.830 --> 00:31:33.840 align:start position:0%
yes representative Stapleton
 
00:31:37.430 --> 00:31:37.440 align:start position:0%
was that uh court case uh scotus or was
 
00:31:40.909 --> 00:31:40.919 align:start position:0%
that State Court scotus thank you scotus
 
00:31:43.850 --> 00:31:43.860 align:start position:0%
any other uh comments so I guess what I
 
00:31:45.889 --> 00:31:45.899 align:start position:0%
want to say I really want to give kudos
 
00:31:48.549 --> 00:31:48.559 align:start position:0%
to representative kutab on this because
 
00:31:52.909 --> 00:31:52.919 align:start position:0%
uh my my inclination and I talked to
 
00:31:54.649 --> 00:31:54.659 align:start position:0%
representative Smith and I I don't want
 
00:31:55.669 --> 00:31:55.679 align:start position:0%
to put words in their mouth but I think
 
00:31:57.289 --> 00:31:57.299 align:start position:0%
at least she was sort of thinking this
 
00:31:58.610 --> 00:31:58.620 align:start position:0%
is that
 
00:32:01.130 --> 00:32:01.140 align:start position:0%
I had real question about whether the
 
00:32:02.990 --> 00:32:03.000 align:start position:0%
law whether the First Amendment would
 
00:32:06.169 --> 00:32:06.179 align:start position:0%
Pro would allow a
 
00:32:09.529 --> 00:32:09.539 align:start position:0%
uh this kind of local ordinance and uh
 
00:32:11.870 --> 00:32:11.880 align:start position:0%
fortunately representative cutoff went
 
00:32:14.570 --> 00:32:14.580 align:start position:0%
and got the Supreme Court case that
 
00:32:16.669 --> 00:32:16.679 align:start position:0%
specifically deals with this it's been
 
00:32:18.830 --> 00:32:18.840 align:start position:0%
well I asked our researcher to you know
 
00:32:21.409 --> 00:32:21.419 align:start position:0%
to make sure that it was still good law
 
00:32:24.470 --> 00:32:24.480 align:start position:0%
so to speak and it is and uh this is a
 
00:32:25.789 --> 00:32:25.799 align:start position:0%
there's a Supreme Court case that's
 
00:32:29.110 --> 00:32:29.120 align:start position:0%
really very closely on points from 1988
 
00:32:33.250 --> 00:32:33.260 align:start position:0%
saying that these kind of uh ordinances
 
00:32:36.110 --> 00:32:36.120 align:start position:0%
or laws can be valid and the basic
 
00:32:39.710 --> 00:32:39.720 align:start position:0%
rationale for them is if it's limited if
 
00:32:41.690 --> 00:32:41.700 align:start position:0%
the ordinance is limited to prohibiting
 
00:32:44.210 --> 00:32:44.220 align:start position:0%
picketing in front of a in front of
 
00:32:47.210 --> 00:32:47.220 align:start position:0%
somebody's residence that's okay because
 
00:32:50.029 --> 00:32:50.039 align:start position:0%
there's a privacy interest in the
 
00:32:52.310 --> 00:32:52.320 align:start position:0%
residence in other words the law
 
00:32:55.370 --> 00:32:55.380 align:start position:0%
generally is that if if if somebody's
 
00:32:57.470 --> 00:32:57.480 align:start position:0%
speaking and saying something you don't
 
00:33:00.289 --> 00:33:00.299 align:start position:0%
want to hear you can just walk away but
 
00:33:02.330 --> 00:33:02.340 align:start position:0%
if it's in your house if they're
 
00:33:04.730 --> 00:33:04.740 align:start position:0%
picketing outside your house
 
00:33:06.350 --> 00:33:06.360 align:start position:0%
that house is supposed to be your
 
00:33:08.450 --> 00:33:08.460 align:start position:0%
Sanctuary so where do you walk then if
 
00:33:09.769 --> 00:33:09.779 align:start position:0%
it's in front of your house and that's
 
00:33:11.450 --> 00:33:11.460 align:start position:0%
the rationale
 
00:33:14.630 --> 00:33:14.640 align:start position:0%
um for the for the uh for for the for
 
00:33:17.210 --> 00:33:17.220 align:start position:0%
this Supreme Court case uh the other
 
00:33:19.310 --> 00:33:19.320 align:start position:0%
thing I should say here is I my remember
 
00:33:21.289 --> 00:33:21.299 align:start position:0%
very distinctly that the sponsor of the
 
00:33:24.830 --> 00:33:24.840 align:start position:0%
bill told us at the hearing that
 
00:33:28.190 --> 00:33:28.200 align:start position:0%
um the uh trial court in the case that
 
00:33:30.889 --> 00:33:30.899 align:start position:0%
he referenced uh from over in new Fields
 
00:33:33.110 --> 00:33:33.120 align:start position:0%
had not reached the Constitutional issue
 
00:33:35.990 --> 00:33:36.000 align:start position:0%
well in fact the trial court did reach
 
00:33:37.909 --> 00:33:37.919 align:start position:0%
the Constitutional issue and if you've
 
00:33:40.310 --> 00:33:40.320 align:start position:0%
had a chance to read that decision it
 
00:33:43.370 --> 00:33:43.380 align:start position:0%
was a 20 20 plus page decision this was
 
00:33:47.269 --> 00:33:47.279 align:start position:0%
not some you know motion denied uh uh it
 
00:33:49.789 --> 00:33:49.799 align:start position:0%
was a very well thought out decision by
 
00:33:51.409 --> 00:33:51.419 align:start position:0%
judge all
 
00:33:53.930 --> 00:33:53.940 align:start position:0%
um yeah and I thought very well reasoned
 
00:33:56.810 --> 00:33:56.820 align:start position:0%
so I uh you know for all those reasons I
 
00:34:00.590 --> 00:34:00.600 align:start position:0%
think that uh itl in this bill uh makes
 
00:34:02.090 --> 00:34:02.100 align:start position:0%
makes sense
 
00:34:04.370 --> 00:34:04.380 align:start position:0%
yeah representative Oregon the other
 
00:34:05.690 --> 00:34:05.700 align:start position:0%
thing was
 
00:34:08.930 --> 00:34:08.940 align:start position:0%
another is aspect this situation was um
 
00:34:11.690 --> 00:34:11.700 align:start position:0%
the the official in question there
 
00:34:13.669 --> 00:34:13.679 align:start position:0%
he doesn't really we don't really have
 
00:34:15.290 --> 00:34:15.300 align:start position:0%
very tight security around them but it
 
00:34:16.570 --> 00:34:16.580 align:start position:0%
would be reasonable to have a security
 
00:34:19.430 --> 00:34:19.440 align:start position:0%
firmer around them for a primitive round
 
00:34:22.010 --> 00:34:22.020 align:start position:0%
of in certain situations and uh
 
00:34:24.050 --> 00:34:24.060 align:start position:0%
and in fact the same official uh
 
00:34:25.970 --> 00:34:25.980 align:start position:0%
canceled uh
 
00:34:29.270 --> 00:34:29.280 align:start position:0%
the governor canceled his uh well moved
 
00:34:30.470 --> 00:34:30.480 align:start position:0%
his um
 
00:34:32.629 --> 00:34:32.639 align:start position:0%
moved his inaugural speech to a TV
 
00:34:34.970 --> 00:34:34.980 align:start position:0%
studio precisely because he had uh
 
00:34:36.950 --> 00:34:36.960 align:start position:0%
security concerns about holding it at
 
00:34:38.149 --> 00:34:38.159 align:start position:0%
the State House
 
00:34:40.430 --> 00:34:40.440 align:start position:0%
think that's relevant to the bill I
 
00:34:42.950 --> 00:34:42.960 align:start position:0%
don't think it's in the bill no I tend
 
00:34:44.030 --> 00:34:44.040 align:start position:0%
to think I tend to think you're right
 
00:34:45.589 --> 00:34:45.599 align:start position:0%
okay sorry that's all right
 
00:34:49.010 --> 00:34:49.020 align:start position:0%
representative tour you had a yeah just
 
00:34:51.230 --> 00:34:51.240 align:start position:0%
just adding on I I also think that
 
00:34:53.389 --> 00:34:53.399 align:start position:0%
outside of the provisions that
 
00:34:53.399 --> 00:34:55.250 align:start position:0%
outside of the provisions that
representative

00:34:55.250 --> 00:34:55.260 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:34:57.710 --> 00:34:57.720 align:start position:0%
um you know uncovered there is a
 
00:35:00.770 --> 00:35:00.780 align:start position:0%
constitutional prohibition of you know
 
00:35:03.050 --> 00:35:03.060 align:start position:0%
establishing ordinances that just in
 
00:35:04.970 --> 00:35:04.980 align:start position:0%
general as the bills titled you know
 
00:35:06.470 --> 00:35:06.480 align:start position:0%
criminalize the right to peacefully
 
00:35:08.450 --> 00:35:08.460 align:start position:0%
assemble so I feel like both things are
 
00:35:10.190 --> 00:35:10.200 align:start position:0%
true yes no no I agree with that I think
 
00:35:11.870 --> 00:35:11.880 align:start position:0%
and I think that there apparently there
 
00:35:13.490 --> 00:35:13.500 align:start position:0%
are some cases that say you know if the
 
00:35:18.530 --> 00:35:18.540 align:start position:0%
if the yeah if the if if you're
 
00:35:20.990 --> 00:35:21.000 align:start position:0%
picketing not just in some particular
 
00:35:22.550 --> 00:35:22.560 align:start position:0%
house but you're pick you know you walk
 
00:35:24.710 --> 00:35:24.720 align:start position:0%
along the block or whatever that might
 
00:35:27.349 --> 00:35:27.359 align:start position:0%
that might be a different situation uh
 
00:35:29.810 --> 00:35:29.820 align:start position:0%
yes representative Waltz and um thank
 
00:35:31.130 --> 00:35:31.140 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question what was the
 
00:35:33.170 --> 00:35:33.180 align:start position:0%
name of that case uh
 
00:35:33.180 --> 00:35:38.750 align:start position:0%
name of that case uh
uh

00:35:38.750 --> 00:35:38.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:41.690 --> 00:35:41.700 align:start position:0%
frisbee Schultz was it Schultz okay
 
00:35:44.630 --> 00:35:44.640 align:start position:0%
frisbee it's a it's a 1988 U.S Supreme
 
00:35:47.089 --> 00:35:47.099 align:start position:0%
Court case still good law and one
 
00:35:48.470 --> 00:35:48.480 align:start position:0%
follow-up yes
 
00:35:48.480 --> 00:35:50.329 align:start position:0%
follow-up yes
um

00:35:50.329 --> 00:35:50.339 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:53.210 --> 00:35:53.220 align:start position:0%
now the individual involved or the
 
00:35:55.430 --> 00:35:55.440 align:start position:0%
parties involved in that case were they
 
00:35:57.829 --> 00:35:57.839 align:start position:0%
elected public officials or were they
 
00:35:59.750 --> 00:35:59.760 align:start position:0%
private individuals what was the nature
 
00:36:01.550 --> 00:36:01.560 align:start position:0%
of that case because I believe it has
 
00:36:01.560 --> 00:36:03.349 align:start position:0%
of that case because I believe it has
bearing

00:36:03.349 --> 00:36:03.359 align:start position:0%
bearing
 
00:36:06.170 --> 00:36:06.180 align:start position:0%
I don't I honestly don't remember if
 
00:36:09.290 --> 00:36:09.300 align:start position:0%
they were a public official or you don't
 
00:36:11.210 --> 00:36:11.220 align:start position:0%
have the expectation of privacy that a
 
00:36:12.710 --> 00:36:12.720 align:start position:0%
member of the general public does being
 
00:36:14.690 --> 00:36:14.700 align:start position:0%
that we're elected it was it was a
 
00:36:20.390 --> 00:36:20.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:20.400 --> 00:36:21.890 align:start position:0%
 
uh

00:36:21.890 --> 00:36:21.900 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:36:24.290 --> 00:36:24.300 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm although I'm not you know I
 
00:36:27.530 --> 00:36:27.540 align:start position:0%
guess I've been targeted at a particular
 
00:36:29.990 --> 00:36:30.000 align:start position:0%
individual I still it's a particular
 
00:36:31.730 --> 00:36:31.740 align:start position:0%
individual's house I'm not sure that you
 
00:36:35.210 --> 00:36:35.220 align:start position:0%
know even the even uh a public official
 
00:36:36.950 --> 00:36:36.960 align:start position:0%
doesn't have some
 
00:36:38.690 --> 00:36:38.700 align:start position:0%
ability to bet you know to have a
 
00:36:40.910 --> 00:36:40.920 align:start position:0%
sanctuary I agree it's a different it
 
00:36:42.470 --> 00:36:42.480 align:start position:0%
makes it can make a difference I
 
00:36:44.829 --> 00:36:44.839 align:start position:0%
definitely agree to that but um
 
00:36:47.690 --> 00:36:47.700 align:start position:0%
we've defeated uh
 
00:36:50.230 --> 00:36:50.240 align:start position:0%
online bullying bills against
 
00:36:53.150 --> 00:36:53.160 align:start position:0%
politicians uh historically in in this
 
00:36:55.550 --> 00:36:55.560 align:start position:0%
house very recently uh you know this is
 
00:36:57.650 --> 00:36:57.660 align:start position:0%
kind of a parallel course
 
00:37:00.290 --> 00:37:00.300 align:start position:0%
okay representative Smith
 
00:37:02.450 --> 00:37:02.460 align:start position:0%
I have a question for which I don't know
 
00:37:05.329 --> 00:37:05.339 align:start position:0%
the answer and I guess it has two parts
 
00:37:07.849 --> 00:37:07.859 align:start position:0%
one is
 
00:37:07.859 --> 00:37:08.870 align:start position:0%
one is
um it

00:37:08.870 --> 00:37:08.880 align:start position:0%
um it
 
00:37:10.550 --> 00:37:10.560 align:start position:0%
the home
 
00:37:13.370 --> 00:37:13.380 align:start position:0%
an issue here is the home of an elected
 
00:37:15.650 --> 00:37:15.660 align:start position:0%
official where
 
00:37:19.250 --> 00:37:19.260 align:start position:0%
um the elected official resides with
 
00:37:20.930 --> 00:37:20.940 align:start position:0%
his family
 
00:37:25.490 --> 00:37:25.500 align:start position:0%
who are not public officials and the
 
00:37:29.530 --> 00:37:29.540 align:start position:0%
elected official does have an office
 
00:37:35.050 --> 00:37:35.060 align:start position:0%
which is available to the public
 
00:37:37.670 --> 00:37:37.680 align:start position:0%
to express
 
00:37:40.310 --> 00:37:40.320 align:start position:0%
um opposition uh
 
00:37:44.990 --> 00:37:45.000 align:start position:0%
or concern about his decisions and
 
00:37:47.089 --> 00:37:47.099 align:start position:0%
um of course I don't even play a lawyer
 
00:37:51.349 --> 00:37:51.359 align:start position:0%
on TV but I think those are also
 
00:37:54.230 --> 00:37:54.240 align:start position:0%
relevant factors at least in the
 
00:37:57.710 --> 00:37:57.720 align:start position:0%
circumstances if not the laws no very I
 
00:37:59.750 --> 00:37:59.760 align:start position:0%
I would say very relevant I guess to me
 
00:38:02.810 --> 00:38:02.820 align:start position:0%
what I would tend to say is that
 
00:38:07.069 --> 00:38:07.079 align:start position:0%
um to the extent that the rationale for
 
00:38:10.250 --> 00:38:10.260 align:start position:0%
this bill was there's an ordinance in
 
00:38:11.990 --> 00:38:12.000 align:start position:0%
this town and you know arguably others
 
00:38:14.690 --> 00:38:14.700 align:start position:0%
that that is sort of blatantly
 
00:38:16.910 --> 00:38:16.920 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional we need to have a
 
00:38:20.569 --> 00:38:20.579 align:start position:0%
statue to kind of correct that it seems
 
00:38:23.630 --> 00:38:23.640 align:start position:0%
to me that that that that that is not
 
00:38:26.089 --> 00:38:26.099 align:start position:0%
true I may there may be you know maybe
 
00:38:27.589 --> 00:38:27.599 align:start position:0%
there would be some as representative
 
00:38:29.390 --> 00:38:29.400 align:start position:0%
Turner pointed out maybe you know if
 
00:38:30.710 --> 00:38:30.720 align:start position:0%
somebody were picketing and they were
 
00:38:32.630 --> 00:38:32.640 align:start position:0%
picketing along the block as opposed to
 
00:38:35.030 --> 00:38:35.040 align:start position:0%
that particular house that might raise a
 
00:38:36.829 --> 00:38:36.839 align:start position:0%
question as to whether or not
 
00:38:39.530 --> 00:38:39.540 align:start position:0%
um the ordinance could be applied but um
 
00:38:42.829 --> 00:38:42.839 align:start position:0%
I I guess I would say that for us to
 
00:38:44.569 --> 00:38:44.579 align:start position:0%
pass this statute
 
00:38:46.550 --> 00:38:46.560 align:start position:0%
um would would really not make a lot of
 
00:38:48.530 --> 00:38:48.540 align:start position:0%
sense given that it's that the ordinance
 
00:38:51.470 --> 00:38:51.480 align:start position:0%
is at least not you know facially
 
00:38:53.569 --> 00:38:53.579 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional that that would be my
 
00:38:53.579 --> 00:38:55.730 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional that that would be my
view

00:38:55.730 --> 00:38:55.740 align:start position:0%
view
 
00:38:57.890 --> 00:38:57.900 align:start position:0%
all right any further any further
 
00:38:59.870 --> 00:38:59.880 align:start position:0%
discussion by anyone
 
00:39:03.050 --> 00:39:03.060 align:start position:0%
yes representative I also felt very
 
00:39:06.170 --> 00:39:06.180 align:start position:0%
strongly that it was a town problem and
 
00:39:07.730 --> 00:39:07.740 align:start position:0%
if the town people didn't like the
 
00:39:09.470 --> 00:39:09.480 align:start position:0%
ordinance and they need to they could
 
00:39:11.390 --> 00:39:11.400 align:start position:0%
pull it back it's a very excellent
 
00:39:13.130 --> 00:39:13.140 align:start position:0%
excellent point that's a very that's a
 
00:39:14.270 --> 00:39:14.280 align:start position:0%
very good point
 
00:39:16.430 --> 00:39:16.440 align:start position:0%
other discussion
 
00:39:18.349 --> 00:39:18.359 align:start position:0%
all right are we ready for the question
 
00:39:21.650 --> 00:39:21.660 align:start position:0%
all right then on uh I I'd ask the clerk
 
00:39:23.750 --> 00:39:23.760 align:start position:0%

the motion to itl passes 20-0
 
00:40:17.150 --> 00:40:17.160 align:start position:0%
and is there any reason that this uh
 
00:40:18.950 --> 00:40:18.960 align:start position:0%
could not also be put on the consent
 
00:40:20.930 --> 00:40:20.940 align:start position:0%

that
 
00:40:24.710 --> 00:40:24.720 align:start position:0%
all right it'll be put on consent
 
00:40:29.810 --> 00:40:29.820 align:start position:0%
uh next I return to HB 169 uh relative
 
00:40:32.569 --> 00:40:32.579 align:start position:0%

00:40:46.370 --> 00:40:46.380 align:start position:0%
to adopt the amendment in otpa with
 
00:40:48.109 --> 00:40:48.119 align:start position:0%
Amendment right and what is the
 
00:40:50.930 --> 00:40:50.940 align:start position:0%
amendment I know we have it here but I
 
00:40:58.190 --> 00:40:58.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:00.550 --> 00:41:00.560 align:start position:0%
the amendment is
 
00:41:03.829 --> 00:41:03.839 align:start position:0%
2023-0134h and it was just removing the
 
00:41:07.069 --> 00:41:07.079 align:start position:0%
change in section B and only changing
 
00:41:10.910 --> 00:41:10.920 align:start position:0%
in section c from a preponderance of
 
00:41:12.710 --> 00:41:12.720 align:start position:0%
evidence to clear and convincing
 
00:41:12.720 --> 00:41:15.109 align:start position:0%
evidence to clear and convincing
evidence

00:41:15.109 --> 00:41:15.119 align:start position:0%
evidence
 
00:41:17.390 --> 00:41:17.400 align:start position:0%
does everybody have
 
00:41:19.730 --> 00:41:19.740 align:start position:0%
that Amendment
 
00:41:21.650 --> 00:41:21.660 align:start position:0%
oh okay
 
00:41:23.390 --> 00:41:23.400 align:start position:0%
email yeah I emailed it out to everybody
 
00:41:28.310 --> 00:41:28.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:31.970 --> 00:41:31.980 align:start position:0%
so I'm set okay so did
 
00:41:33.770 --> 00:41:33.780 align:start position:0%
um yes representative
 
00:41:37.670 --> 00:41:37.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:40.910 --> 00:41:40.920 align:start position:0%
so um just in I mean it was sent ahead
 
00:41:42.530 --> 00:41:42.540 align:start position:0%
of time to the committee right to
 
00:41:44.150 --> 00:41:44.160 align:start position:0%
evaluate I think just in the future if
 
00:41:45.589 --> 00:41:45.599 align:start position:0%
you're proposing Amendment just have
 
00:41:47.089 --> 00:41:47.099 align:start position:0%
copies printed for the committee just in
 
00:41:49.130 --> 00:41:49.140 align:start position:0%
case that's all yeah just I mean does
 
00:41:49.140 --> 00:41:50.569 align:start position:0%
case that's all yeah just I mean does
any

00:41:50.569 --> 00:41:50.579 align:start position:0%
any
 
00:41:52.609 --> 00:41:52.619 align:start position:0%
oh yeah would you mind that would be
 
00:41:54.829 --> 00:41:54.839 align:start position:0%
great if you yeah
 
00:41:59.050 --> 00:41:59.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:02.829 --> 00:42:02.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:05.569 --> 00:42:05.579 align:start position:0%
to the non-lawyers the difference
 
00:42:08.450 --> 00:42:08.460 align:start position:0%
between the ponderance of the evidence
 
00:42:12.650 --> 00:42:12.660 align:start position:0%
and here and convincing yes
 
00:42:15.710 --> 00:42:15.720 align:start position:0%
um so preponderance of the evidence is
 
00:42:18.109 --> 00:42:18.119 align:start position:0%
the standard that is typically used in a
 
00:42:19.730 --> 00:42:19.740 align:start position:0%
civil case like let's say an automobile
 
00:42:22.609 --> 00:42:22.619 align:start position:0%
accident or a breach of contract and
 
00:42:24.790 --> 00:42:24.800 align:start position:0%
essentially it means
 
00:42:27.890 --> 00:42:27.900 align:start position:0%
51 percent for lack of a for lack of a
 
00:42:29.089 --> 00:42:29.099 align:start position:0%
better term the way it's usually
 
00:42:30.890 --> 00:42:30.900 align:start position:0%
explained in court is you know the
 
00:42:33.109 --> 00:42:33.119 align:start position:0%
scales of justice that to their two
 
00:42:35.390 --> 00:42:35.400 align:start position:0%
scales typically what a judge will say
 
00:42:38.750 --> 00:42:38.760 align:start position:0%
is that to it to sustain Whoever has the
 
00:42:40.670 --> 00:42:40.680 align:start position:0%
burden of proof to sustain the burden of
 
00:42:43.250 --> 00:42:43.260 align:start position:0%
proof the party with the burden has to
 
00:42:46.250 --> 00:42:46.260 align:start position:0%
tip the scales ever so slightly in that
 
00:42:48.650 --> 00:42:48.660 align:start position:0%
party's favor if they tip the other way
 
00:42:51.050 --> 00:42:51.060 align:start position:0%
or more importantly if they're if they
 
00:42:53.390 --> 00:42:53.400 align:start position:0%
remain in equal balance then the burden
 
00:42:55.310 --> 00:42:55.320 align:start position:0%
has not been sustained if the burden is
 
00:42:56.990 --> 00:42:57.000 align:start position:0%
preponderance of the evidence
 
00:43:00.230 --> 00:43:00.240 align:start position:0%
clear and convincing evidence is a
 
00:43:02.270 --> 00:43:02.280 align:start position:0%
significantly higher standard of proof
 
00:43:04.849 --> 00:43:04.859 align:start position:0%
it's to use the analogy it's not it's
 
00:43:06.349 --> 00:43:06.359 align:start position:0%
not proof Beyond A Reasonable Doubt
 
00:43:08.630 --> 00:43:08.640 align:start position:0%
which is the the criminal case it has to
 
00:43:10.790 --> 00:43:10.800 align:start position:0%
be really you know spewed in favor of
 
00:43:13.390 --> 00:43:13.400 align:start position:0%
guilt but it's it's somewhere in between
 
00:43:16.069 --> 00:43:16.079 align:start position:0%
preponderance of the evidence and
 
00:43:17.809 --> 00:43:17.819 align:start position:0%
proof Beyond A Reasonable Doubt which
 
00:43:20.150 --> 00:43:20.160 align:start position:0%
means it's got to be it's got to be you
 
00:43:23.870 --> 00:43:23.880 align:start position:0%
know very clear that uh that the uh that
 
00:43:25.609 --> 00:43:25.619 align:start position:0%
the person with the burden of proof has
 
00:43:28.069 --> 00:43:28.079 align:start position:0%
sustained the burden of proofs
 
00:43:29.510 --> 00:43:29.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:43:31.790 --> 00:43:31.800 align:start position:0%
all right do you want to speak to your
 
00:43:35.030 --> 00:43:35.040 align:start position:0%
uh your Amendment uh award and or the
 
00:43:38.569 --> 00:43:38.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:40.790 --> 00:43:40.800 align:start position:0%
yeah so in the the reason that I made
 
00:43:44.270 --> 00:43:44.280 align:start position:0%
the amendment was dcyf had come out and
 
00:43:44.280 --> 00:43:45.050 align:start position:0%
the amendment was dcyf had come out and
and

00:43:45.050 --> 00:43:45.060 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:43:45.060 --> 00:43:45.890 align:start position:0%
and
um

00:43:45.890 --> 00:43:45.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:47.450 --> 00:43:47.460 align:start position:0%
stated that they basically needed the
 
00:43:49.250 --> 00:43:49.260 align:start position:0%
change in section B not to happen but
 
00:43:50.569 --> 00:43:50.579 align:start position:0%
they were neutral to the change in
 
00:43:53.930 --> 00:43:53.940 align:start position:0%
section c and
 
00:43:56.630 --> 00:43:56.640 align:start position:0%
I'm in support of passing it I I do feel
 
00:43:58.970 --> 00:43:58.980 align:start position:0%
like the burden of proof shouldn't be
 
00:43:58.980 --> 00:44:00.589 align:start position:0%
like the burden of proof shouldn't be
higher

00:44:00.589 --> 00:44:00.599 align:start position:0%
higher
 
00:44:02.870 --> 00:44:02.880 align:start position:0%
for a stranger than it is for a
 
00:44:05.809 --> 00:44:05.819 align:start position:0%
grandparent and I think that we need to
 
00:44:07.370 --> 00:44:07.380 align:start position:0%
think about the best interest of the
 
00:44:09.230 --> 00:44:09.240 align:start position:0%
child and the fact that this child may
 
00:44:11.990 --> 00:44:12.000 align:start position:0%
be ping-ponging around the women who
 
00:44:15.349 --> 00:44:15.359 align:start position:0%
spoke at our session
 
00:44:17.210 --> 00:44:17.220 align:start position:0%
did contact me afterwards and let me
 
00:44:18.829 --> 00:44:18.839 align:start position:0%
know that her granddaughter has since
 
00:44:20.270 --> 00:44:20.280 align:start position:0%
been pulled
 
00:44:23.510 --> 00:44:23.520 align:start position:0%
from the father again so that child was
 
00:44:25.790 --> 00:44:25.800 align:start position:0%
in the custody with the grandmother for
 
00:44:27.730 --> 00:44:27.740 align:start position:0%
I believe she said it was like six years
 
00:44:30.109 --> 00:44:30.119 align:start position:0%
then went back to somebody that she
 
00:44:32.390 --> 00:44:32.400 align:start position:0%
barely knew for three weeks and then was
 
00:44:34.849 --> 00:44:34.859 align:start position:0%
pulled again and it's just
 
00:44:37.550 --> 00:44:37.560 align:start position:0%
a lot I think for a child and I I really
 
00:44:38.690 --> 00:44:38.700 align:start position:0%
feel like
 
00:44:40.910 --> 00:44:40.920 align:start position:0%
in the best interest of the child to
 
00:44:43.790 --> 00:44:43.800 align:start position:0%
make sure that the evidence is correct
 
00:44:46.730 --> 00:44:46.740 align:start position:0%
that they're in the right place
 
00:44:49.550 --> 00:44:49.560 align:start position:0%
other comments on yes representative
 
00:44:52.130 --> 00:44:52.140 align:start position:0%
Divine there there was there was one um
 
00:44:53.569 --> 00:44:53.579 align:start position:0%
I don't remember who made the statement
 
00:44:55.370 --> 00:44:55.380 align:start position:0%
and this is the only thing that I could
 
00:44:58.490 --> 00:44:58.500 align:start position:0%
I could pull out of this was on line
 
00:45:01.130 --> 00:45:01.140 align:start position:0%
nine of the original
 
00:45:01.140 --> 00:45:01.790 align:start position:0%
nine of the original
um

00:45:01.790 --> 00:45:01.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:05.630 --> 00:45:05.640 align:start position:0%
document that we got it had grandparent
 
00:45:07.970 --> 00:45:07.980 align:start position:0%
or guardian and and I was hoping that
 
00:45:07.980 --> 00:45:10.010 align:start position:0%
or guardian and and I was hoping that
somebody

00:45:10.010 --> 00:45:10.020 align:start position:0%
somebody
 
00:45:13.430 --> 00:45:13.440 align:start position:0%
and then further in it was any sort of
 
00:45:15.589 --> 00:45:15.599 align:start position:0%
abuse not just substance abuse to have
 
00:45:17.569 --> 00:45:17.579 align:start position:0%
an amendment made for that and I don't
 
00:45:19.730 --> 00:45:19.740 align:start position:0%
know what the I don't know if we should
 
00:45:21.950 --> 00:45:21.960 align:start position:0%
do that or and I'm not sure what the
 
00:45:21.960 --> 00:45:22.970 align:start position:0%
do that or and I'm not sure what the
correct

00:45:22.970 --> 00:45:22.980 align:start position:0%
correct
 
00:45:24.770 --> 00:45:24.780 align:start position:0%
way to go about it is and I think on
 
00:45:27.950 --> 00:45:27.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:31.190 --> 00:45:31.200 align:start position:0%
um on line six on the everything that
 
00:45:33.770 --> 00:45:33.780 align:start position:0%
you have there on line six is fine but
 
00:45:36.290 --> 00:45:36.300 align:start position:0%
grandparents should be also slash
 
00:45:39.650 --> 00:45:39.660 align:start position:0%
guardian and then substance abuse should
 
00:45:44.770 --> 00:45:44.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:47.870 --> 00:45:47.880 align:start position:0%
yeah and and so would you be okay I
 
00:45:50.569 --> 00:45:50.579 align:start position:0%
guess instead of saying slash or any
 
00:45:52.970 --> 00:45:52.980 align:start position:0%
Guardian family member because I think
 
00:45:55.550 --> 00:45:55.560 align:start position:0%
it's different when somebody my thought
 
00:45:58.430 --> 00:45:58.440 align:start position:0%
is that when you take a foster child in
 
00:46:01.190 --> 00:46:01.200 align:start position:0%
as a stranger
 
00:46:02.990 --> 00:46:03.000 align:start position:0%
you can kind of distance yourself a bit
 
00:46:04.609 --> 00:46:04.619 align:start position:0%
and not get that emotional attachment
 
00:46:06.109 --> 00:46:06.119 align:start position:0%
right but when it's your family member
 
00:46:08.030 --> 00:46:08.040 align:start position:0%
when it's your grandchild when it's your
 
00:46:10.790 --> 00:46:10.800 align:start position:0%
your niece or your nephew it is so hard
 
00:46:12.829 --> 00:46:12.839 align:start position:0%
not to get attached and for them to get
 
00:46:15.230 --> 00:46:15.240 align:start position:0%
attached to in the family like to you
 
00:46:17.510 --> 00:46:17.520 align:start position:0%
know their cousins or whomever else may
 
00:46:20.750 --> 00:46:20.760 align:start position:0%
be living in the home yeah I'd be fine
 
00:46:23.510 --> 00:46:23.520 align:start position:0%
with that I I understand the god the
 
00:46:24.890 --> 00:46:24.900 align:start position:0%
grandparent now better I just know that
 
00:46:26.390 --> 00:46:26.400 align:start position:0%
these were questions that were raised
 
00:46:28.849 --> 00:46:28.859 align:start position:0%
during when we had you know committee
 
00:46:30.890 --> 00:46:30.900 align:start position:0%
hearings and I just wanted them to be
 
00:46:32.510 --> 00:46:32.520 align:start position:0%
addressed again
 
00:46:34.790 --> 00:46:34.800 align:start position:0%
um and and two the um somebody like I
 
00:46:36.829 --> 00:46:36.839 align:start position:0%
said had said any sort of abuse not just
 
00:46:39.410 --> 00:46:39.420 align:start position:0%
substance abuse because abuse could be a
 
00:46:41.390 --> 00:46:41.400 align:start position:0%
number of things and if
 
00:46:43.849 --> 00:46:43.859 align:start position:0%
I just think maybe there should be that
 
00:46:46.190 --> 00:46:46.200 align:start position:0%
Amendment added
 
00:46:49.030 --> 00:46:49.040 align:start position:0%
other yes
 
00:46:51.829 --> 00:46:51.839 align:start position:0%
representative Smith oh all right
 
00:46:54.950 --> 00:46:54.960 align:start position:0%
representative Beth thank you so
 
00:46:57.470 --> 00:46:57.480 align:start position:0%
I appreciate the work on this
 
00:47:00.770 --> 00:47:00.780 align:start position:0%
um bill and I I my concern is that if
 
00:47:02.809 --> 00:47:02.819 align:start position:0%
the grandparents have a higher I mean if
 
00:47:05.030 --> 00:47:05.040 align:start position:0%
the parents have a higher standard they
 
00:47:06.589 --> 00:47:06.599 align:start position:0%
have to meet when their grandparents are
 
00:47:08.630 --> 00:47:08.640 align:start position:0%
the guardian I mean it might prevent
 
00:47:10.670 --> 00:47:10.680 align:start position:0%
them from entering into the guardian the
 
00:47:12.050 --> 00:47:12.060 align:start position:0%
parents entering into the guardianship
 
00:47:14.210 --> 00:47:14.220 align:start position:0%
in the first place because a lot of the
 
00:47:15.589 --> 00:47:15.599 align:start position:0%
times I mean we need this good
 
00:47:17.930 --> 00:47:17.940 align:start position:0%
communication between the parents and
 
00:47:20.569 --> 00:47:20.579 align:start position:0%
their parents and the child and
 
00:47:20.579 --> 00:47:21.230 align:start position:0%
their parents and the child and
um

00:47:21.230 --> 00:47:21.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:24.890 --> 00:47:24.900 align:start position:0%
I I do I don't I don't understand the
 
00:47:27.170 --> 00:47:27.180 align:start position:0%
reasoning why if it's a grandparent
 
00:47:29.390 --> 00:47:29.400 align:start position:0%
that's taking care of the child that
 
00:47:31.309 --> 00:47:31.319 align:start position:0%
it'd be harder for the parents to get
 
00:47:33.770 --> 00:47:33.780 align:start position:0%
the child back to exercise their
 
00:47:36.890 --> 00:47:36.900 align:start position:0%
parental rights and um
 
00:47:39.829 --> 00:47:39.839 align:start position:0%
you know so I I kind of I'm worried
 
00:47:41.690 --> 00:47:41.700 align:start position:0%
about that
 
00:47:44.210 --> 00:47:44.220 align:start position:0%
other yes representative Stapleton
 
00:47:48.530 --> 00:47:48.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:51.349 --> 00:47:51.359 align:start position:0%
um the bill is specifically tied that
 
00:47:53.510 --> 00:47:53.520 align:start position:0%
level of evidence clear and convincing
 
00:47:56.150 --> 00:47:56.160 align:start position:0%
is specifically tied to the parents
 
00:47:59.690 --> 00:47:59.700 align:start position:0%
substance abuse or dependence
 
00:48:03.290 --> 00:48:03.300 align:start position:0%
the phenomenon of grand families which
 
00:48:05.630 --> 00:48:05.640 align:start position:0%
was the subject of a bill some few years
 
00:48:08.710 --> 00:48:08.720 align:start position:0%
ago by Senator Hennessey out of Lebanon
 
00:48:12.109 --> 00:48:12.119 align:start position:0%
recognizing that so many parents are
 
00:48:13.910 --> 00:48:13.920 align:start position:0%
deficient in the upbringing of their
 
00:48:15.970 --> 00:48:15.980 align:start position:0%
children because of substance or alcohol
 
00:48:19.609 --> 00:48:19.619 align:start position:0%
abuse that the grandparents are the
 
00:48:23.450 --> 00:48:23.460 align:start position:0%
first line of defense natural for them
 
00:48:25.790 --> 00:48:25.800 align:start position:0%
to take care of their grandchild and
 
00:48:30.490 --> 00:48:30.500 align:start position:0%
family and I really applaud this
 
00:48:33.050 --> 00:48:33.060 align:start position:0%
this amendment
 
00:48:36.050 --> 00:48:36.060 align:start position:0%
um relative to focusing on substance
 
00:48:38.089 --> 00:48:38.099 align:start position:0%
abuse which we know is very very
 
00:48:41.809 --> 00:48:41.819 align:start position:0%
difficult to overcome I know people who
 
00:48:44.990 --> 00:48:45.000 align:start position:0%
are Grand family parents for children
 
00:48:48.950 --> 00:48:48.960 align:start position:0%
who are sub substance abusers and it's
 
00:48:51.290 --> 00:48:51.300 align:start position:0%
very difficult for them to get out of
 
00:48:53.630 --> 00:48:53.640 align:start position:0%
that condition and stay out of it
 
00:48:57.530 --> 00:48:57.540 align:start position:0%
there's relapse and I think this hits a
 
00:49:00.109 --> 00:49:00.119 align:start position:0%
nail right on the head
 
00:49:02.510 --> 00:49:02.520 align:start position:0%
yes I think representative Manos and
 
00:49:05.450 --> 00:49:05.460 align:start position:0%
then I'll get to representative Turner
 
00:49:08.510 --> 00:49:08.520 align:start position:0%
um this this bill is under termination
 
00:49:12.050 --> 00:49:12.060 align:start position:0%
of Guardianship and I find it troubling
 
00:49:13.750 --> 00:49:13.760 align:start position:0%
that we would have two different
 
00:49:18.770 --> 00:49:18.780 align:start position:0%
standards for terminating guardianships
 
00:49:18.780 --> 00:49:19.609 align:start position:0%
standards for terminating guardianships
um

00:49:19.609 --> 00:49:19.619 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:49:22.370 --> 00:49:22.380 align:start position:0%
and I think we should
 
00:49:26.630 --> 00:49:26.640 align:start position:0%
um have the same standard uh which I
 
00:49:29.630 --> 00:49:29.640 align:start position:0%
think should be clear in convincing in
 
00:49:29.640 --> 00:49:31.190 align:start position:0%
think should be clear in convincing in
both

00:49:31.190 --> 00:49:31.200 align:start position:0%
both
 
00:49:35.450 --> 00:49:35.460 align:start position:0%
um both sections so I would oppose the
 
00:49:39.050 --> 00:49:39.060 align:start position:0%
amendment in the sense that it sets two
 
00:49:41.210 --> 00:49:41.220 align:start position:0%
standards two different evidentiary
 
00:49:44.990 --> 00:49:45.000 align:start position:0%
standards it actually fixes it to set it
 
00:49:47.809 --> 00:49:47.819 align:start position:0%
to be the same standard
 
00:49:47.819 --> 00:49:51.109 align:start position:0%
to be the same standard
Instagram

00:49:51.109 --> 00:49:51.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:53.870 --> 00:49:53.880 align:start position:0%
the paragraph B currently says we are in
 
00:49:55.849 --> 00:49:55.859 align:start position:0%
convincing as it's written now and I
 
00:49:57.650 --> 00:49:57.660 align:start position:0%
took the change out so that it's not
 
00:49:57.660 --> 00:50:00.770 align:start position:0%
took the change out so that it's not
changing

00:50:00.770 --> 00:50:00.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:03.410 --> 00:50:03.420 align:start position:0%
it so both power
 
00:50:05.710 --> 00:50:05.720 align:start position:0%
B and C will be yes
 
00:50:10.010 --> 00:50:10.020 align:start position:0%
yeah I I I think the standard should be
 
00:50:12.170 --> 00:50:12.180 align:start position:0%
a preponderance of the evidence in both
 
00:50:12.180 --> 00:50:14.809 align:start position:0%
a preponderance of the evidence in both
paragraphs

00:50:14.809 --> 00:50:14.819 align:start position:0%
paragraphs
 
00:50:18.349 --> 00:50:18.359 align:start position:0%
right so other other comments um
 
00:50:21.589 --> 00:50:21.599 align:start position:0%
representative yeah I just want to say I
 
00:50:25.069 --> 00:50:25.079 align:start position:0%
I I do agree with the the comments that
 
00:50:26.750 --> 00:50:26.760 align:start position:0%
representative Devine mentioned that it
 
00:50:29.390 --> 00:50:29.400 align:start position:0%
does seem sort of odd to have a
 
00:50:30.770 --> 00:50:30.780 align:start position:0%
provision that just carves out
 
00:50:32.390 --> 00:50:32.400 align:start position:0%
grandparents and just carves out
 
00:50:34.190 --> 00:50:34.200 align:start position:0%
substance abuse when there's a whole
 
00:50:36.530 --> 00:50:36.540 align:start position:0%
range of situations that would be
 
00:50:39.829 --> 00:50:39.839 align:start position:0%
covered and I I do however think that
 
00:50:42.710 --> 00:50:42.720 align:start position:0%
moving it to clear and convincing
 
00:50:45.349 --> 00:50:45.359 align:start position:0%
um given the fact that this is you know
 
00:50:48.290 --> 00:50:48.300 align:start position:0%
a minor that got placed into into
 
00:50:50.390 --> 00:50:50.400 align:start position:0%
guardianship because of some sort of
 
00:50:53.150 --> 00:50:53.160 align:start position:0%
abusive um or difficult situation that
 
00:50:55.250 --> 00:50:55.260 align:start position:0%
you know the idea that it would be just
 
00:50:56.870 --> 00:50:56.880 align:start position:0%
a minor tip of the scales between
 
00:50:58.790 --> 00:50:58.800 align:start position:0%
whether it's right or wrong to return
 
00:51:00.970 --> 00:51:00.980 align:start position:0%
that that child to the parent yet
 
00:51:03.290 --> 00:51:03.300 align:start position:0%
especially when they're not in agreement
 
00:51:04.910 --> 00:51:04.920 align:start position:0%
that the child should go back which
 
00:51:07.549 --> 00:51:07.559 align:start position:0%
seems like a too low of a standard
 
00:51:12.950 --> 00:51:12.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:15.109 --> 00:51:15.119 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
00:51:17.750 --> 00:51:17.760 align:start position:0%
um I'm sitting here listening to some
 
00:51:21.349 --> 00:51:21.359 align:start position:0%
very thoughtful responses to the
 
00:51:24.109 --> 00:51:24.119 align:start position:0%
incredibly hard work that our clerk has
 
00:51:26.390 --> 00:51:26.400 align:start position:0%
already put into this I wonder if I
 
00:51:29.270 --> 00:51:29.280 align:start position:0%
could suggest that
 
00:51:34.730 --> 00:51:34.740 align:start position:0%
um uh representative and perhaps two or
 
00:51:36.530 --> 00:51:36.540 align:start position:0%
three other members of the committee
 
00:51:42.170 --> 00:51:42.180 align:start position:0%
could form an an informal ad hoc uh
 
00:51:46.970 --> 00:51:46.980 align:start position:0%
subcommittee to look at this and come
 
00:51:49.910 --> 00:51:49.920 align:start position:0%
back to us on Wednesday
 
00:51:49.920 --> 00:51:51.470 align:start position:0%
back to us on Wednesday
with

00:51:51.470 --> 00:51:51.480 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:51:54.530 --> 00:51:54.540 align:start position:0%
um an amendment that perhaps answers
 
00:51:56.510 --> 00:51:56.520 align:start position:0%
some of the concerns or at least
 
00:51:58.730 --> 00:51:58.740 align:start position:0%
clarifies what people are thinking about
 
00:52:01.849 --> 00:52:01.859 align:start position:0%
it would that be something that the
 
00:52:04.670 --> 00:52:04.680 align:start position:0%
chair would entertain absolutely I think
 
00:52:06.530 --> 00:52:06.540 align:start position:0%
that's an excellent suggestion
 
00:52:08.990 --> 00:52:09.000 align:start position:0%
um the the and I want the only one other
 
00:52:11.030 --> 00:52:11.040 align:start position:0%
thing that that I would say on this and
 
00:52:14.750 --> 00:52:14.760 align:start position:0%
I I want to note here that um I um
 
00:52:17.450 --> 00:52:17.460 align:start position:0%
if this if this were going to be an
 
00:52:19.609 --> 00:52:19.619 align:start position:0%
ought to pass as amended uh by
 
00:52:21.470 --> 00:52:21.480 align:start position:0%
representative cutoff's amendment I I
 
00:52:23.630 --> 00:52:23.640 align:start position:0%
told my caucus last night that I would
 
00:52:25.430 --> 00:52:25.440 align:start position:0%
you know if everybody if everybody else
 
00:52:27.109 --> 00:52:27.119 align:start position:0%
agreed with this I would go along with
 
00:52:28.490 --> 00:52:28.500 align:start position:0%
it because I you know I didn't want to
 
00:52:32.030 --> 00:52:32.040 align:start position:0%
be the sort of one one hold out but I do
 
00:52:37.430 --> 00:52:37.440 align:start position:0%
want to say that I am concerned about in
 
00:52:40.370 --> 00:52:40.380 align:start position:0%
I have no problem with having clear and
 
00:52:42.490 --> 00:52:42.500 align:start position:0%
convincing evidence in
 
00:52:48.230 --> 00:52:48.240 align:start position:0%
subsection B where it's the guardian who
 
00:52:50.690 --> 00:52:50.700 align:start position:0%
has is we're the replacing the burden of
 
00:52:54.770 --> 00:52:54.780 align:start position:0%
proof on I am concerned about having
 
00:52:57.410 --> 00:52:57.420 align:start position:0%
clear and convincing in subsection C
 
00:52:59.569 --> 00:52:59.579 align:start position:0%
placing that burden on the parents
 
00:53:01.190 --> 00:53:01.200 align:start position:0%
because as representative Macbeth
 
00:53:02.690 --> 00:53:02.700 align:start position:0%
pointed out
 
00:53:05.569 --> 00:53:05.579 align:start position:0%
my concern there is that what that means
 
00:53:08.089 --> 00:53:08.099 align:start position:0%
what we're basically saying there
 
00:53:11.089 --> 00:53:11.099 align:start position:0%
is that even if the parent
 
00:53:14.030 --> 00:53:14.040 align:start position:0%
could show the court that it's more
 
00:53:17.150 --> 00:53:17.160 align:start position:0%
probable than not that I have you know
 
00:53:20.089 --> 00:53:20.099 align:start position:0%
I've cleaned up my ACT I'm now a fit
 
00:53:23.210 --> 00:53:23.220 align:start position:0%
parent for the child that's not enough
 
00:53:25.069 --> 00:53:25.079 align:start position:0%
the court still
 
00:53:28.130 --> 00:53:28.140 align:start position:0%
cannot the court still cannot return the
 
00:53:30.710 --> 00:53:30.720 align:start position:0%
child to the parents and my concern on
 
00:53:33.410 --> 00:53:33.420 align:start position:0%
that is really they're a constitutional
 
00:53:35.450 --> 00:53:35.460 align:start position:0%
one there is a U.S Supreme Court case
 
00:53:38.210 --> 00:53:38.220 align:start position:0%
called Troxel versus somebody I don't
 
00:53:39.829 --> 00:53:39.839 align:start position:0%
remember I don't remember the name but
 
00:53:42.049 --> 00:53:42.059 align:start position:0%
it and it's it's not a it's been around
 
00:53:44.569 --> 00:53:44.579 align:start position:0%
for you know probably 20 years at least
 
00:53:48.710 --> 00:53:48.720 align:start position:0%
basic that the the basic upshot of that
 
00:53:51.589 --> 00:53:51.599 align:start position:0%
case is that parents
 
00:53:55.549 --> 00:53:55.559 align:start position:0%
have have very special rights with
 
00:53:58.069 --> 00:53:58.079 align:start position:0%
regard to their children and that if a
 
00:54:02.150 --> 00:54:02.160 align:start position:0%
parent is a fit parent it takes
 
00:54:05.930 --> 00:54:05.940 align:start position:0%
it takes something more than you know it
 
00:54:07.849 --> 00:54:07.859 align:start position:0%
takes something more to deprive the
 
00:54:09.770 --> 00:54:09.780 align:start position:0%
parent of the child and so I have a
 
00:54:11.809 --> 00:54:11.819 align:start position:0%
concern I'm not please understand I'm
 
00:54:13.430 --> 00:54:13.440 align:start position:0%
not saying that I'm you know this is
 
00:54:15.290 --> 00:54:15.300 align:start position:0%
clearly unconstitutional I'm not saying
 
00:54:16.970 --> 00:54:16.980 align:start position:0%
that at all I'm just saying that I think
 
00:54:19.730 --> 00:54:19.740 align:start position:0%
there's at least a question about it and
 
00:54:22.430 --> 00:54:22.440 align:start position:0%
so that reinforces representative
 
00:54:24.589 --> 00:54:24.599 align:start position:0%
Smith's idea that this is something
 
00:54:26.630 --> 00:54:26.640 align:start position:0%
maybe we we should have a subcommittee
 
00:54:28.370 --> 00:54:28.380 align:start position:0%
look at and you can just you know you
 
00:54:29.990 --> 00:54:30.000 align:start position:0%
can at least take a look at that case
 
00:54:32.510 --> 00:54:32.520 align:start position:0%
and see what you know see what you think
 
00:54:36.290 --> 00:54:36.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:40.130 --> 00:54:40.140 align:start position:0%
if you agree I would like to suggest
 
00:54:40.140 --> 00:54:40.930 align:start position:0%
if you agree I would like to suggest
um

00:54:40.930 --> 00:54:40.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:54:42.970 --> 00:54:42.980 align:start position:0%
that perhaps
 
00:54:47.329 --> 00:54:47.339 align:start position:0%
Representatives Macbeth and Manos who do
 
00:54:49.549 --> 00:54:49.559 align:start position:0%
work in this particular area might have
 
00:54:52.910 --> 00:54:52.920 align:start position:0%
some special skills that could help in
 
00:54:55.490 --> 00:54:55.500 align:start position:0%
um and if the clerk is willing to sit
 
00:54:57.170 --> 00:54:57.180 align:start position:0%
down with the clerk and I don't know who
 
00:55:00.349 --> 00:55:00.359 align:start position:0%
else you'd like to suggest and it seems
 
00:55:01.970 --> 00:55:01.980 align:start position:0%
to me it could be done in time for
 
00:55:05.030 --> 00:55:05.040 align:start position:0%
Wednesday so I I think yeah and if it
 
00:55:06.410 --> 00:55:06.420 align:start position:0%
turns out you know if you get really
 
00:55:08.270 --> 00:55:08.280 align:start position:0%
into it it can't be well then we'll you
 
00:55:10.309 --> 00:55:10.319 align:start position:0%
know we can do it we can do another time
 
00:55:12.530 --> 00:55:12.540 align:start position:0%
thank you the calendar appropriately to
 
00:55:15.530 --> 00:55:15.540 align:start position:0%
right yeah yeah yeah exactly so is
 
00:55:17.510 --> 00:55:17.520 align:start position:0%
anybody else uh representative do you
 
00:55:19.250 --> 00:55:19.260 align:start position:0%
have some interest in also being on on
 
00:55:20.750 --> 00:55:20.760 align:start position:0%

great so then why don't yes why don't we
 
00:55:32.089 --> 00:55:32.099 align:start position:0%
say uh Macbeth Manos enter will be the
 
00:55:33.829 --> 00:55:33.839 align:start position:0%
subcommittee and we'll report back to us
 
00:55:35.150 --> 00:55:35.160 align:start position:0%

um

00:56:25.370 --> 00:56:25.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:29.030 --> 00:56:29.040 align:start position:0%
uh regarding uh relating to fundamental
 
00:56:30.829 --> 00:56:30.839 align:start position:0%
rights providing that the constitution
 
00:56:32.690 --> 00:56:32.700 align:start position:0%
protects the right to marry and I
 
00:56:34.670 --> 00:56:34.680 align:start position:0%
represent I recognize representative
 
00:56:37.370 --> 00:56:37.380 align:start position:0%
Alexander thank you Mr chair I move um
 
00:56:40.069 --> 00:56:40.079 align:start position:0%
cacr5 and expedient to legislate right
 
00:56:45.190 --> 00:56:45.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:48.410 --> 00:56:48.420 align:start position:0%
no I see how
 
00:56:50.329 --> 00:56:50.339 align:start position:0%
is there a second to that motion uh
 
00:56:53.030 --> 00:56:53.040 align:start position:0%
representative Stapleton oh yeah
 
00:56:56.030 --> 00:56:56.040 align:start position:0%
uh yeah it's all right yes sir all right
 
00:56:56.040 --> 00:56:56.630 align:start position:0%
uh yeah it's all right yes sir all right
um

00:56:56.630 --> 00:56:56.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:56:59.210 --> 00:56:59.220 align:start position:0%
right uh representative Alexander do you
 
00:57:01.490 --> 00:57:01.500 align:start position:0%
wish to speak to the motion yeah just
 
00:57:05.150 --> 00:57:05.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:07.150 --> 00:57:07.160 align:start position:0%
this looks like a very simple
 
00:57:09.650 --> 00:57:09.660 align:start position:0%
Constitutional Amendment but when you
 
00:57:12.109 --> 00:57:12.119 align:start position:0%
start making things simple things get I
 
00:57:14.270 --> 00:57:14.280 align:start position:0%
feel like more complicated and you know
 
00:57:16.790 --> 00:57:16.800 align:start position:0%
I I feel like everybody should have a
 
00:57:19.670 --> 00:57:19.680 align:start position:0%
fundamental right to to get married
 
00:57:22.069 --> 00:57:22.079 align:start position:0%
um I think the Supreme Court has dealt
 
00:57:24.349 --> 00:57:24.359 align:start position:0%
with this very well I don't think
 
00:57:26.210 --> 00:57:26.220 align:start position:0%
there's really any assault on the right
 
00:57:28.609 --> 00:57:28.619 align:start position:0%
to marriage by anybody
 
00:57:31.730 --> 00:57:31.740 align:start position:0%
um but I do worry that when we when we
 
00:57:33.650 --> 00:57:33.660 align:start position:0%
put a question when we put a question of
 
00:57:37.250 --> 00:57:37.260 align:start position:0%
the voters like this it might pass and
 
00:57:38.450 --> 00:57:38.460 align:start position:0%
there'll be some very unintended
 
00:57:40.370 --> 00:57:40.380 align:start position:0%
consequences to that
 
00:57:43.010 --> 00:57:43.020 align:start position:0%
um I mean I asked during the the hearing
 
00:57:44.930 --> 00:57:44.940 align:start position:0%
what happens when you'd like to marry
 
00:57:47.510 --> 00:57:47.520 align:start position:0%
two or three or four people is that your
 
00:57:49.370 --> 00:57:49.380 align:start position:0%
fundamental right
 
00:57:51.230 --> 00:57:51.240 align:start position:0%
um if you'd like to marry a minor is
 
00:57:53.329 --> 00:57:53.339 align:start position:0%
that your fundamental right I think that
 
00:57:55.910 --> 00:57:55.920 align:start position:0%
creates a lot more problems than it
 
00:57:58.190 --> 00:57:58.200 align:start position:0%
solves when there really is no assault
 
00:58:00.290 --> 00:58:00.300 align:start position:0%
on marriage or anybody's right to get
 
00:58:02.510 --> 00:58:02.520 align:start position:0%
married the way they'd like to
 
00:58:04.309 --> 00:58:04.319 align:start position:0%
um in this state and certainly not in
 
00:58:06.410 --> 00:58:06.420 align:start position:0%
the country so
 
00:58:09.410 --> 00:58:09.420 align:start position:0%
although I sympathize with the sponsors
 
00:58:11.270 --> 00:58:11.280 align:start position:0%
um intention of putting this into the
 
00:58:12.589 --> 00:58:12.599 align:start position:0%
Constitution I think that we already
 
00:58:14.450 --> 00:58:14.460 align:start position:0%
have that right
 
00:58:16.609 --> 00:58:16.619 align:start position:0%
um and I think it's restricted in a
 
00:58:19.130 --> 00:58:19.140 align:start position:0%
responsible way so with that I just hope
 
00:58:20.690 --> 00:58:20.700 align:start position:0%
the committee would vote with me thank
 
00:58:20.700 --> 00:58:21.829 align:start position:0%
the committee would vote with me thank
you

00:58:21.829 --> 00:58:21.839 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:58:25.250 --> 00:58:25.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:28.309 --> 00:58:28.319 align:start position:0%
uh yeah I I distributed an amendment
 
00:58:29.930 --> 00:58:29.940 align:start position:0%
that if this
 
00:58:32.569 --> 00:58:32.579 align:start position:0%
um motion does not pass I'm hope I'm
 
00:58:34.010 --> 00:58:34.020 align:start position:0%
saying this right that we might
 
00:58:34.020 --> 00:58:35.569 align:start position:0%
saying this right that we might
entertain

00:58:35.569 --> 00:58:35.579 align:start position:0%
entertain
 
00:58:39.170 --> 00:58:39.180 align:start position:0%
um and uh it goes directly I think to
 
00:58:41.750 --> 00:58:41.760 align:start position:0%
what representative Alexander raised and
 
00:58:44.390 --> 00:58:44.400 align:start position:0%
it emanated from his comments during the
 
00:58:46.670 --> 00:58:46.680 align:start position:0%
the testimony
 
00:58:49.670 --> 00:58:49.680 align:start position:0%
um a a
 
00:58:52.789 --> 00:58:52.799 align:start position:0%
feel that the there are some real flaws
 
00:58:55.789 --> 00:58:55.799 align:start position:0%
in the original proposed
 
00:58:57.589 --> 00:58:57.599 align:start position:0%
um bill
 
00:58:59.690 --> 00:58:59.700 align:start position:0%
um particularly as a human right it
 
00:59:02.329 --> 00:59:02.339 align:start position:0%
would Grant it to everyone
 
00:59:04.430 --> 00:59:04.440 align:start position:0%
um and there are no clarifications and
 
00:59:04.440 --> 00:59:05.690 align:start position:0%
um and there are no clarifications and
so

00:59:05.690 --> 00:59:05.700 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:59:08.270 --> 00:59:08.280 align:start position:0%
um it would literally probably Grant the
 
00:59:09.490 --> 00:59:09.500 align:start position:0%
right to
 
00:59:11.690 --> 00:59:11.700 align:start position:0%
polygamy it would Grant the right to
 
00:59:13.849 --> 00:59:13.859 align:start position:0%
child marriage at any age it would Grant
 
00:59:16.190 --> 00:59:16.200 align:start position:0%
the right to incest
 
00:59:16.200 --> 00:59:16.789 align:start position:0%
the right to incest
um

00:59:16.789 --> 00:59:16.799 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:20.990 --> 00:59:21.000 align:start position:0%
and it seemed as though those three sort
 
00:59:22.970 --> 00:59:22.980 align:start position:0%
of flaws could be healed with a simple
 
00:59:25.609 --> 00:59:25.619 align:start position:0%
change to language so if you look at the
 
00:59:25.619 --> 00:59:27.289 align:start position:0%
change to language so if you look at the
amendment

00:59:27.289 --> 00:59:27.299 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:59:31.150 --> 00:59:31.160 align:start position:0%
um basically I ins are working with with
 
00:59:34.670 --> 00:59:34.680 align:start position:0%
OLS inserted uh more or less the same
 
00:59:37.490 --> 00:59:37.500 align:start position:0%
phrase in three places and and it it
 
00:59:41.030 --> 00:59:41.040 align:start position:0%
basically adds the language of any two
 
00:59:43.970 --> 00:59:43.980 align:start position:0%
natural persons at least 18 years of age
 
00:59:46.870 --> 00:59:46.880 align:start position:0%
and outside of one degree of
 
00:59:49.010 --> 00:59:49.020 align:start position:0%
consanguinity I hope I'm saying that
 
00:59:51.109 --> 00:59:51.119 align:start position:0%
right that's a new word for me
 
00:59:51.119 --> 00:59:51.829 align:start position:0%
right that's a new word for me
um

00:59:51.829 --> 00:59:51.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:54.170 --> 00:59:54.180 align:start position:0%
and so we now would read the right of
 
00:59:56.030 --> 00:59:56.040 align:start position:0%
any two natural persons at least 18
 
00:59:58.730 --> 00:59:58.740 align:start position:0%
years of age and outside of one degree
 
01:00:00.829 --> 01:00:00.839 align:start position:0%
of consanguinity to marry shall be a
 
01:00:02.870 --> 01:00:02.880 align:start position:0%
fundamental right that actually
 
01:00:05.710 --> 01:00:05.720 align:start position:0%
clarifies those four different things
 
01:00:09.309 --> 01:00:09.319 align:start position:0%
one to your point it says it has to be
 
01:00:13.309 --> 01:00:13.319 align:start position:0%
two the the the number two so no more or
 
01:00:13.319 --> 01:00:14.329 align:start position:0%
two the the the number two so no more or
less

01:00:14.329 --> 01:00:14.339 align:start position:0%
less
 
01:00:16.730 --> 01:00:16.740 align:start position:0%
um it says natural persons which might
 
01:00:19.010 --> 01:00:19.020 align:start position:0%
seem like an unnecessary thing but if
 
01:00:20.690 --> 01:00:20.700 align:start position:0%
you've all seen the movie Her with
 
01:00:22.190 --> 01:00:22.200 align:start position:0%
Scarlett Johansson
 
01:00:24.049 --> 01:00:24.059 align:start position:0%
um we're moving into new errors where
 
01:00:25.549 --> 01:00:25.559 align:start position:0%
people can have relationships with
 
01:00:28.309 --> 01:00:28.319 align:start position:0%
non-natural people and and it also
 
01:00:30.230 --> 01:00:30.240 align:start position:0%
excludes things like animals which I
 
01:00:32.150 --> 01:00:32.160 align:start position:0%
know are also a concern
 
01:00:34.670 --> 01:00:34.680 align:start position:0%
um 18 years or older I'll come back to
 
01:00:37.490 --> 01:00:37.500 align:start position:0%
that in one second and then one degree
 
01:00:39.890 --> 01:00:39.900 align:start position:0%
of kansanguinity
 
01:00:43.190 --> 01:00:43.200 align:start position:0%
um is ols's way of saying second cousin
 
01:00:45.470 --> 01:00:45.480 align:start position:0%
or further which is the current standard
 
01:00:47.569 --> 01:00:47.579 align:start position:0%
for New Hampshire
 
01:00:51.829 --> 01:00:51.839 align:start position:0%
um so just go into the 18 and uh
 
01:00:55.789 --> 01:00:55.799 align:start position:0%
um 18 years and and an older language
 
01:00:58.430 --> 01:00:58.440 align:start position:0%
um I just wanted to clarify that would
 
01:01:01.309 --> 01:01:01.319 align:start position:0%
not put it in conflict with our current
 
01:01:03.650 --> 01:01:03.660 align:start position:0%
um rules regarding
 
01:01:06.049 --> 01:01:06.059 align:start position:0%
um marriage even though some marriages
 
01:01:09.049 --> 01:01:09.059 align:start position:0%
are allowable out younger than that it
 
01:01:10.609 --> 01:01:10.619 align:start position:0%
just says the right would not be
 
01:01:14.150 --> 01:01:14.160 align:start position:0%
guaranteed at 18. and under the age of
 
01:01:16.069 --> 01:01:16.079 align:start position:0%
18. so it would still leave the
 
01:01:19.670 --> 01:01:19.680 align:start position:0%
legislature capable of uh regulating
 
01:01:23.089 --> 01:01:23.099 align:start position:0%
marriages below the age of 18.
 
01:01:25.130 --> 01:01:25.140 align:start position:0%
um you know and and I know that there's
 
01:01:26.930 --> 01:01:26.940 align:start position:0%
some current discussion around that so I
 
01:01:29.569 --> 01:01:29.579 align:start position:0%
just wanted to clarify that that uh and
 
01:01:31.789 --> 01:01:31.799 align:start position:0%
correct me if I'm wrong but that's my
 
01:01:33.650 --> 01:01:33.660 align:start position:0%
understanding is that that it would it
 
01:01:36.109 --> 01:01:36.119 align:start position:0%
would not be in Conflict
 
01:01:36.119 --> 01:01:37.010 align:start position:0%
would not be in Conflict
um

01:01:37.010 --> 01:01:37.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:01:39.170 --> 01:01:39.180 align:start position:0%
uh or you know or any other group that
 
01:01:41.210 --> 01:01:41.220 align:start position:0%
is not covered by by the right would
 
01:01:43.910 --> 01:01:43.920 align:start position:0%
still be uh able to be
 
01:01:43.920 --> 01:01:44.690 align:start position:0%
still be uh able to be
um

01:01:44.690 --> 01:01:44.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:01:47.569 --> 01:01:47.579 align:start position:0%
constrained by or or or granted any
 
01:01:49.670 --> 01:01:49.680 align:start position:0%
other sort of legislative
 
01:01:52.490 --> 01:01:52.500 align:start position:0%
um marriage uh changes
 
01:01:52.500 --> 01:01:53.030 align:start position:0%
um marriage uh changes
um

01:01:53.030 --> 01:01:53.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:01:56.329 --> 01:01:56.339 align:start position:0%
so I think it places the what what we'll
 
01:01:57.650 --> 01:01:57.660 align:start position:0%
call the right since it's the
 
01:01:59.030 --> 01:01:59.040 align:start position:0%
Constitutional Amendment as a human
 
01:02:01.370 --> 01:02:01.380 align:start position:0%
right sort of within the bounds of
 
01:02:03.410 --> 01:02:03.420 align:start position:0%
current uh marriage law I read all the
 
01:02:05.270 --> 01:02:05.280 align:start position:0%
regulations about the current marriage
 
01:02:07.609 --> 01:02:07.619 align:start position:0%
law and it basically this would be
 
01:02:10.010 --> 01:02:10.020 align:start position:0%
within all of what we're currently we're
 
01:02:10.020 --> 01:02:11.510 align:start position:0%
within all of what we're currently we're
doing

01:02:11.510 --> 01:02:11.520 align:start position:0%
doing
 
01:02:14.210 --> 01:02:14.220 align:start position:0%
um so with that I guess I'd say I hope
 
01:02:16.730 --> 01:02:16.740 align:start position:0%
you'd accept the amendment so we can and
 
01:02:17.930 --> 01:02:17.940 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to speak to the bill at
 
01:02:20.089 --> 01:02:20.099 align:start position:0%
this point just to the amendment to
 
01:02:22.309 --> 01:02:22.319 align:start position:0%
discuss the bill on those terms
 
01:02:25.970 --> 01:02:25.980 align:start position:0%
so any uh representative Alexander
 
01:02:27.410 --> 01:02:27.420 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
01:02:29.450 --> 01:02:29.460 align:start position:0%
representative for amending it to
 
01:02:31.370 --> 01:02:31.380 align:start position:0%
address some concerns
 
01:02:34.910 --> 01:02:34.920 align:start position:0%
um I worry putting something to the
 
01:02:36.829 --> 01:02:36.839 align:start position:0%
voters that's already a right because I
 
01:02:38.030 --> 01:02:38.040 align:start position:0%
worry about what the unintended
 
01:02:40.309 --> 01:02:40.319 align:start position:0%
consequence of it will be after I mean
 
01:02:42.650 --> 01:02:42.660 align:start position:0%
nowhere in the amendment does it say the
 
01:02:44.750 --> 01:02:44.760 align:start position:0%
right of two consenting adults right
 
01:02:46.549 --> 01:02:46.559 align:start position:0%
there's not even like you don't have to
 
01:02:48.410 --> 01:02:48.420 align:start position:0%
consent to it you could just be like Oh
 
01:02:50.329 --> 01:02:50.339 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna marry
 
01:02:52.190 --> 01:02:52.200 align:start position:0%
um you know somebody that can't even
 
01:02:53.990 --> 01:02:54.000 align:start position:0%
consent themselves maybe through a
 
01:02:56.930 --> 01:02:56.940 align:start position:0%
disability or or other means so I I
 
01:02:58.370 --> 01:02:58.380 align:start position:0%
guess I worry this is going to create
 
01:03:00.289 --> 01:03:00.299 align:start position:0%
more problems than it solves because we
 
01:03:03.349 --> 01:03:03.359 align:start position:0%
already there's no roadblocks for people
 
01:03:05.809 --> 01:03:05.819 align:start position:0%
to get married in this state so
 
01:03:05.819 --> 01:03:06.410 align:start position:0%
to get married in this state so
um

01:03:06.410 --> 01:03:06.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:03:08.150 --> 01:03:08.160 align:start position:0%
it creates more problems than solves
 
01:03:09.410 --> 01:03:09.420 align:start position:0%
that's all
 
01:03:13.370 --> 01:03:13.380 align:start position:0%
other yes representative I realize I'm a
 
01:03:16.789 --> 01:03:16.799 align:start position:0%
sub here so that's all right jobs can
 
01:03:20.210 --> 01:03:20.220 align:start position:0%
speak too great thank you Mr chair
 
01:03:20.220 --> 01:03:20.930 align:start position:0%
speak too great thank you Mr chair
um

01:03:20.930 --> 01:03:20.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:03:24.589 --> 01:03:24.599 align:start position:0%
I think it is certainly
 
01:03:24.599 --> 01:03:26.450 align:start position:0%
I think it is certainly
um

01:03:26.450 --> 01:03:26.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:03:29.329 --> 01:03:29.339 align:start position:0%
many people are of the belief that
 
01:03:32.030 --> 01:03:32.040 align:start position:0%
certain laws that are in effect
 
01:03:32.040 --> 01:03:33.829 align:start position:0%
certain laws that are in effect
currently

01:03:33.829 --> 01:03:33.839 align:start position:0%
currently
 
01:03:36.530 --> 01:03:36.540 align:start position:0%
could be struck down by the current
 
01:03:37.910 --> 01:03:37.920 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court
 
01:03:40.549 --> 01:03:40.559 align:start position:0%
and in the U.S Supreme Court
 
01:03:40.559 --> 01:03:41.870 align:start position:0%
and in the U.S Supreme Court
and

01:03:41.870 --> 01:03:41.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:03:45.289 --> 01:03:45.299 align:start position:0%
wouldn't it be an awful thing for people
 
01:03:48.289 --> 01:03:48.299 align:start position:0%
in the granite state if marriage
 
01:03:51.430 --> 01:03:51.440 align:start position:0%
equality was struck down in the courts
 
01:03:54.109 --> 01:03:54.119 align:start position:0%
since that really strengthened the law
 
01:03:56.569 --> 01:03:56.579 align:start position:0%
for the whole country
 
01:04:00.410 --> 01:04:00.420 align:start position:0%
um isn't doing this bill with the
 
01:04:00.420 --> 01:04:02.710 align:start position:0%
um isn't doing this bill with the
amendment

01:04:02.710 --> 01:04:02.720 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
01:04:08.390 --> 01:04:08.400 align:start position:0%
making sure there isn't a gap because of
 
01:04:11.690 --> 01:04:11.700 align:start position:0%
likely Supreme Court U.S Supreme Court
 
01:04:11.700 --> 01:04:13.069 align:start position:0%
likely Supreme Court U.S Supreme Court
decisions

01:04:13.069 --> 01:04:13.079 align:start position:0%
decisions
 
01:04:16.730 --> 01:04:16.740 align:start position:0%
there's not a gap in what families would
 
01:04:16.740 --> 01:04:17.510 align:start position:0%
there's not a gap in what families would
need

01:04:17.510 --> 01:04:17.520 align:start position:0%
need
 
01:04:20.870 --> 01:04:20.880 align:start position:0%
for their choices by way of marriage
 
01:04:22.730 --> 01:04:22.740 align:start position:0%
wouldn't this
 
01:04:26.210 --> 01:04:26.220 align:start position:0%
recognize the fact that there's a decent
 
01:04:29.870 --> 01:04:29.880 align:start position:0%
enough chance why leave future Granite
 
01:04:29.880 --> 01:04:31.010 align:start position:0%
enough chance why leave future Granite
Staters

01:04:31.010 --> 01:04:31.020 align:start position:0%
Staters
 
01:04:36.170 --> 01:04:36.180 align:start position:0%
in limbo when they're eager to marry
 
01:04:36.180 --> 01:04:37.609 align:start position:0%
in limbo when they're eager to marry
other

01:04:37.609 --> 01:04:37.619 align:start position:0%
other
 
01:04:40.549 --> 01:04:40.559 align:start position:0%
yes representative Stapleton
 
01:04:42.410 --> 01:04:42.420 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
01:04:42.420 --> 01:04:43.910 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
um

01:04:43.910 --> 01:04:43.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:04:45.829 --> 01:04:45.839 align:start position:0%
I think the founding fathers of the New
 
01:04:47.809 --> 01:04:47.819 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Constitution
 
01:04:50.890 --> 01:04:50.900 align:start position:0%
is telling with absence of marriage
 
01:04:56.270 --> 01:04:56.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:58.309 --> 01:04:58.319 align:start position:0%
and I believe that there's a reason for
 
01:05:01.370 --> 01:05:01.380 align:start position:0%
that when when you establish uh in the
 
01:05:05.329 --> 01:05:05.339 align:start position:0%
constitution of of writing the document
 
01:05:07.670 --> 01:05:07.680 align:start position:0%
now you're you're being maybe too
 
01:05:10.270 --> 01:05:10.280 align:start position:0%
specific and now you're going to have to
 
01:05:13.549 --> 01:05:13.559 align:start position:0%
Define all the ensuing variables and
 
01:05:15.609 --> 01:05:15.619 align:start position:0%
possibilities and
 
01:05:18.770 --> 01:05:18.780 align:start position:0%
nuances that's going to come forth and
 
01:05:20.510 --> 01:05:20.520 align:start position:0%
think that may have been part of the
 
01:05:23.270 --> 01:05:23.280 align:start position:0%
reason why the founding fathers decided
 
01:05:26.750 --> 01:05:26.760 align:start position:0%
not to enter that into the
 
01:05:28.549 --> 01:05:28.559 align:start position:0%
Constitutional document I also believe
 
01:05:31.210 --> 01:05:31.220 align:start position:0%
that at the time
 
01:05:35.329 --> 01:05:35.339 align:start position:0%
the Reliance upon religious Customs
 
01:05:37.549 --> 01:05:37.559 align:start position:0%
Traditions ethos
 
01:05:40.730 --> 01:05:40.740 align:start position:0%
beliefs marriage was considered more in
 
01:05:43.970 --> 01:05:43.980 align:start position:0%
the province of that aspect of human
 
01:05:46.390 --> 01:05:46.400 align:start position:0%
culture rather than
 
01:05:48.890 --> 01:05:48.900 align:start position:0%
some controlling Factor by the
 
01:05:48.900 --> 01:05:50.870 align:start position:0%
some controlling Factor by the
government

01:05:50.870 --> 01:05:50.880 align:start position:0%
government
 
01:05:54.470 --> 01:05:54.480 align:start position:0%
I I think we're stepping into dangerous
 
01:05:57.589 --> 01:05:57.599 align:start position:0%
territory here going into the weeds and
 
01:05:58.870 --> 01:05:58.880 align:start position:0%
it would only
 
01:06:00.890 --> 01:06:00.900 align:start position:0%
incur more
 
01:06:03.770 --> 01:06:03.780 align:start position:0%
uh and more of um
 
01:06:07.309 --> 01:06:07.319 align:start position:0%
law and clarification and documentation
 
01:06:09.650 --> 01:06:09.660 align:start position:0%
on at night I would be opposed to the
 
01:06:09.660 --> 01:06:11.030 align:start position:0%
on at night I would be opposed to the
amendment

01:06:11.030 --> 01:06:11.040 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
01:06:13.370 --> 01:06:13.380 align:start position:0%
other comments
 
01:06:15.410 --> 01:06:15.420 align:start position:0%
um representative Turner
 
01:06:17.750 --> 01:06:17.760 align:start position:0%
yeah I just wanted to Circle back one
 
01:06:18.829 --> 01:06:18.839 align:start position:0%
more time
 
01:06:20.870 --> 01:06:20.880 align:start position:0%
um on the the concept of consent because
 
01:06:23.510 --> 01:06:23.520 align:start position:0%
that was was a consideration but I think
 
01:06:25.609 --> 01:06:25.619 align:start position:0%
that the difficulty with including a
 
01:06:28.549 --> 01:06:28.559 align:start position:0%
word like consent is that that brings in
 
01:06:32.270 --> 01:06:32.280 align:start position:0%
some other statutorily defined terms in
 
01:06:34.130 --> 01:06:34.140 align:start position:0%
terms of what it means to be able to
 
01:06:38.390 --> 01:06:38.400 align:start position:0%
give consent and and seem to
 
01:06:42.349 --> 01:06:42.359 align:start position:0%
um further complicate the underlying
 
01:06:44.930 --> 01:06:44.940 align:start position:0%
intent of what what this was which is to
 
01:06:48.529 --> 01:06:48.539 align:start position:0%
guarantee people the right to enter into
 
01:06:50.930 --> 01:06:50.940 align:start position:0%
marriage 18 years or older which is
 
01:06:52.970 --> 01:06:52.980 align:start position:0%
typically an age where where you can
 
01:06:54.470 --> 01:06:54.480 align:start position:0%
give consent I do understand your
 
01:06:56.870 --> 01:06:56.880 align:start position:0%
concerns with with
 
01:06:59.690 --> 01:06:59.700 align:start position:0%
you know people who can't but
 
01:07:02.089 --> 01:07:02.099 align:start position:0%
um I don't feel it's in in conflict and
 
01:07:06.349 --> 01:07:06.359 align:start position:0%
so I I you know I this was introduced by
 
01:07:08.390 --> 01:07:08.400 align:start position:0%
representative Heinz
 
01:07:09.829 --> 01:07:09.839 align:start position:0%
um from you know from a different party
 
01:07:11.870 --> 01:07:11.880 align:start position:0%
and I was hoping that we could
 
01:07:11.880 --> 01:07:12.589 align:start position:0%
and I was hoping that we could
um

01:07:12.589 --> 01:07:12.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:07:15.410 --> 01:07:15.420 align:start position:0%
come together around the concept and and
 
01:07:17.510 --> 01:07:17.520 align:start position:0%
make a statement that this sort of
 
01:07:20.750 --> 01:07:20.760 align:start position:0%
oldest institution which I do think is
 
01:07:23.329 --> 01:07:23.339 align:start position:0%
under threat specifically stated in the
 
01:07:26.089 --> 01:07:26.099 align:start position:0%
dava's decision by Clarence Thomas that
 
01:07:29.510 --> 01:07:29.520 align:start position:0%
that uh the obergerfeld version of of
 
01:07:31.190 --> 01:07:31.200 align:start position:0%
marriage specifically should be
 
01:07:34.069 --> 01:07:34.079 align:start position:0%
Revisited he didn't mention
 
01:07:36.970 --> 01:07:36.980 align:start position:0%
um he didn't mention the loving decision
 
01:07:39.890 --> 01:07:39.900 align:start position:0%
that that pertains more directly to him
 
01:07:41.990 --> 01:07:42.000 align:start position:0%
but they were all tied back to the 14th
 
01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:43.069 align:start position:0%
but they were all tied back to the 14th
Amendment

01:07:43.069 --> 01:07:43.079 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
01:07:45.829 --> 01:07:45.839 align:start position:0%
um privacy uh
 
01:07:48.710 --> 01:07:48.720 align:start position:0%
interpretation so I do feel like it's
 
01:07:50.750 --> 01:07:50.760 align:start position:0%
it's a very
 
01:07:50.760 --> 01:07:52.430 align:start position:0%
it's a very
present

01:07:52.430 --> 01:07:52.440 align:start position:0%
present
 
01:07:55.370 --> 01:07:55.380 align:start position:0%
um concept that that could change and it
 
01:07:57.170 --> 01:07:57.180 align:start position:0%
would it would threaten rights that
 
01:07:58.609 --> 01:07:58.619 align:start position:0%
thousands of people in the state have
 
01:08:01.309 --> 01:08:01.319 align:start position:0%
have taken advantage of
 
01:08:04.370 --> 01:08:04.380 align:start position:0%
so I I'm uh representative Smith you
 
01:08:06.170 --> 01:08:06.180 align:start position:0%
would requested I wonder if we could
 
01:08:07.849 --> 01:08:07.859 align:start position:0%
just take a five minute
 
01:08:12.049 --> 01:08:12.059 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:20.700 --> 01:08:20.710 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:20.710 --> 01:08:37.669 align:start position:0%
 
[Laughter]

01:08:37.669 --> 01:08:37.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:37.679 --> 01:09:15.110 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:09:15.110 --> 01:09:15.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:15.120 --> 01:09:21.530 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:09:21.530 --> 01:09:21.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:54.709 --> 01:09:54.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:54.719 --> 01:10:30.550 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:10:30.550 --> 01:10:30.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:03.590 --> 01:11:03.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:03.600 --> 01:11:20.330 align:start position:0%
 
everything

01:11:20.330 --> 01:11:20.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:33.050 --> 01:11:33.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:33.060 --> 01:12:06.490 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:12:06.490 --> 01:12:06.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:16.970 --> 01:15:16.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:18.470 --> 01:15:18.480 align:start position:0%
we're back in session representative
 
01:15:20.510 --> 01:15:20.520 align:start position:0%
Grissom all right thank you sir
 
01:15:20.520 --> 01:15:21.649 align:start position:0%
Grissom all right thank you sir
um

01:15:21.649 --> 01:15:21.659 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:15:24.709 --> 01:15:24.719 align:start position:0%
I think there is a misunderstanding of
 
01:15:28.070 --> 01:15:28.080 align:start position:0%
exactly what the Dobbs decision did and
 
01:15:32.390 --> 01:15:32.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:34.790 --> 01:15:34.800 align:start position:0%
C speaking thank you
 
01:15:36.709 --> 01:15:36.719 align:start position:0%
if the chair Cuts me off I'll cut off
 
01:15:40.010 --> 01:15:40.020 align:start position:0%
but in the meantime I I think there's I
 
01:15:41.510 --> 01:15:41.520 align:start position:0%
think there's misunderstanding of what
 
01:15:45.050 --> 01:15:45.060 align:start position:0%
the dob's decision did and what it could
 
01:15:47.149 --> 01:15:47.159 align:start position:0%
potentially do based on the statements
 
01:15:50.209 --> 01:15:50.219 align:start position:0%
that were made in the ruling
 
01:15:53.209 --> 01:15:53.219 align:start position:0%
what the Dobbs decision did was put the
 
01:15:58.729 --> 01:15:58.739 align:start position:0%
determination of how abortion rights
 
01:16:00.410 --> 01:16:00.420 align:start position:0%
would be determined
 
01:16:03.649 --> 01:16:03.659 align:start position:0%
down to the state level so each of the
 
01:16:06.770 --> 01:16:06.780 align:start position:0%
50 states can have their own laws there
 
01:16:09.290 --> 01:16:09.300 align:start position:0%
would not be one broad federal law
 
01:16:11.630 --> 01:16:11.640 align:start position:0%
that's per the 14th Amendment of the
 
01:16:11.640 --> 01:16:13.689 align:start position:0%
that's per the 14th Amendment of the
Constitution

01:16:13.689 --> 01:16:13.699 align:start position:0%
Constitution
 
01:16:16.130 --> 01:16:16.140 align:start position:0%
I can't remember now I am not an
 
01:16:18.290 --> 01:16:18.300 align:start position:0%
attorney constitutional lawyer however
 
01:16:20.630 --> 01:16:20.640 align:start position:0%
the Constitution says that the powers
 
01:16:22.490 --> 01:16:22.500 align:start position:0%
that are not delegated specifically to
 
01:16:24.350 --> 01:16:24.360 align:start position:0%
the federal government belong at the
 
01:16:27.530 --> 01:16:27.540 align:start position:0%
state so when we consider all those
 
01:16:30.649 --> 01:16:30.659 align:start position:0%
other potential uh brush fires that
 
01:16:33.590 --> 01:16:33.600 align:start position:0%
could emerge such as the oberich fell or
 
01:16:36.169 --> 01:16:36.179 align:start position:0%
the loving or any other rulings that may
 
01:16:38.689 --> 01:16:38.699 align:start position:0%
or may not be dealt with
 
01:16:41.209 --> 01:16:41.219 align:start position:0%
all that would do the precedent would
 
01:16:43.850 --> 01:16:43.860 align:start position:0%
then be each of the 50 states could make
 
01:16:45.770 --> 01:16:45.780 align:start position:0%
their own laws
 
01:16:47.930 --> 01:16:47.940 align:start position:0%
that's all it would do some states may
 
01:16:49.370 --> 01:16:49.380 align:start position:0%
do one thing another state may do
 
01:16:51.530 --> 01:16:51.540 align:start position:0%
another thing and then if there's a
 
01:16:53.510 --> 01:16:53.520 align:start position:0%
conflict then that would be brought back
 
01:16:56.270 --> 01:16:56.280 align:start position:0%
to the to the Supreme Court for for uh
 
01:16:56.280 --> 01:16:57.830 align:start position:0%
to the to the Supreme Court for for uh
adjudication

01:16:57.830 --> 01:16:57.840 align:start position:0%
adjudication
 
01:17:00.770 --> 01:17:00.780 align:start position:0%
what we have presently
 
01:17:04.130 --> 01:17:04.140 align:start position:0%
and we're considering cacr5 is we're
 
01:17:05.990 --> 01:17:06.000 align:start position:0%
trying to
 
01:17:07.729 --> 01:17:07.739 align:start position:0%
prevent something
 
01:17:10.370 --> 01:17:10.380 align:start position:0%
that's not even going to happen we have
 
01:17:12.110 --> 01:17:12.120 align:start position:0%
a law on the books
 
01:17:14.030 --> 01:17:14.040 align:start position:0%
and that's
 
01:17:16.189 --> 01:17:16.199 align:start position:0%
whatever whatever the Supreme Court does
 
01:17:17.209 --> 01:17:17.219 align:start position:0%
they're going to tell us we can do
 
01:17:19.689 --> 01:17:19.699 align:start position:0%
whatever we want so I don't find that
 
01:17:22.729 --> 01:17:22.739 align:start position:0%
cacr5 amended or not is even necessary
 
01:17:27.470 --> 01:17:27.480 align:start position:0%
right any other uh comments
 
01:17:29.930 --> 01:17:29.940 align:start position:0%
so I guess what I guess you know the
 
01:17:34.250 --> 01:17:34.260 align:start position:0%
only thing I would say is that um it it
 
01:17:37.310 --> 01:17:37.320 align:start position:0%
does seem to me that there is
 
01:17:37.320 --> 01:17:38.030 align:start position:0%
does seem to me that there is
um

01:17:38.030 --> 01:17:38.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:17:39.770 --> 01:17:39.780 align:start position:0%
that there's just as representative
 
01:17:41.330 --> 01:17:41.340 align:start position:0%
Alexander said there's just really no
 
01:17:44.870 --> 01:17:44.880 align:start position:0%
reason for this I don't um that that
 
01:17:47.030 --> 01:17:47.040 align:start position:0%
um there's somehow there's a threat to
 
01:17:49.790 --> 01:17:49.800 align:start position:0%
the right to marry I just I I candidly
 
01:17:52.729 --> 01:17:52.739 align:start position:0%
just don't see how it where it exists
 
01:17:56.750 --> 01:17:56.760 align:start position:0%
and bear in mind that this is a this is
 
01:17:58.970 --> 01:17:58.980 align:start position:0%
a state law this would be a state
 
01:18:01.610 --> 01:18:01.620 align:start position:0%
Constitutional Amendment if the if first
 
01:18:04.310 --> 01:18:04.320 align:start position:0%
and somehow lightning struck and the
 
01:18:06.850 --> 01:18:06.860 align:start position:0%
federal con Supreme Court
 
01:18:09.709 --> 01:18:09.719 align:start position:0%
overturned one of those decisions that
 
01:18:12.169 --> 01:18:12.179 align:start position:0%
was referenced that wouldn't mean that
 
01:18:14.750 --> 01:18:14.760 align:start position:0%
there that there was
 
01:18:16.310 --> 01:18:16.320 align:start position:0%
um that you couldn't marry it would be
 
01:18:17.930 --> 01:18:17.940 align:start position:0%
it would simply be turned back to the
 
01:18:20.630 --> 01:18:20.640 align:start position:0%
states and the state law now I don't see
 
01:18:20.640 --> 01:18:21.470 align:start position:0%
states and the state law now I don't see
any

01:18:21.470 --> 01:18:21.480 align:start position:0%
any
 
01:18:23.990 --> 01:18:24.000 align:start position:0%
suggestion that state law is going to be
 
01:18:26.510 --> 01:18:26.520 align:start position:0%
changed in a way that would in any way
 
01:18:29.110 --> 01:18:29.120 align:start position:0%
interfere with the right to marry
 
01:18:32.450 --> 01:18:32.460 align:start position:0%
whether it's on a sexual basis or a
 
01:18:35.990 --> 01:18:36.000 align:start position:0%
racial basis or or uh or any other basis
 
01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:37.250 align:start position:0%
racial basis or or uh or any other basis
so

01:18:37.250 --> 01:18:37.260 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:18:39.709 --> 01:18:39.719 align:start position:0%
um I I just don't think that the amount
 
01:18:44.630 --> 01:18:44.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:47.030 --> 01:18:47.040 align:start position:0%

legislature is there a second
 
01:20:49.189 --> 01:20:49.199 align:start position:0%

all right
 
01:20:52.550 --> 01:20:52.560 align:start position:0%
representative Alexander if you wish to
 
01:20:53.870 --> 01:20:53.880 align:start position:0%
speak to your motion yeah thank you Mr
 
01:20:55.430 --> 01:20:55.440 align:start position:0%
chair a lot of what I'm going to say are
 
01:20:56.870 --> 01:20:56.880 align:start position:0%
what I would have said
 
01:20:58.970 --> 01:20:58.980 align:start position:0%
um I said on the last bill I think it's
 
01:21:01.070 --> 01:21:01.080 align:start position:0%
it's still the same
 
01:21:04.430 --> 01:21:04.440 align:start position:0%
um I support marital freedom and
 
01:21:06.410 --> 01:21:06.420 align:start position:0%
and this is the marital Freedom Act but
 
01:21:08.630 --> 01:21:08.640 align:start position:0%
I don't think there's any obstruction to
 
01:21:10.130 --> 01:21:10.140 align:start position:0%
marital freedom in this state so
 
01:21:11.390 --> 01:21:11.400 align:start position:0%
therefore I just don't think we need
 
01:21:13.729 --> 01:21:13.739 align:start position:0%
this bill so I hope that you'll join me
 
01:21:16.370 --> 01:21:16.380 align:start position:0%

Mr chair yes I move to retain HB 240
 
01:22:27.649 --> 01:22:27.659 align:start position:0%
right HP 240 there's been a motion to to
 
01:22:29.750 --> 01:22:29.760 align:start position:0%
retain and it's been properly seconded
 
01:22:32.330 --> 01:22:32.340 align:start position:0%
uh by representative Wallace is there
 
01:22:37.270 --> 01:22:37.280 align:start position:0%
any discussion on that motion
 
01:22:39.830 --> 01:22:39.840 align:start position:0%
representative manner just a question
 
01:22:41.870 --> 01:22:41.880 align:start position:0%
what would be the purpose of retaining
 
01:22:41.880 --> 01:22:43.850 align:start position:0%
what would be the purpose of retaining
it

01:22:43.850 --> 01:22:43.860 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:22:45.830 --> 01:22:45.840 align:start position:0%
representative Alexander
 
01:22:47.030 --> 01:22:47.040 align:start position:0%
um it's clear that the committee is
 
01:22:49.310 --> 01:22:49.320 align:start position:0%
divided on it so
 
01:22:51.709 --> 01:22:51.719 align:start position:0%
um you know the other motion would be
 
01:22:54.169 --> 01:22:54.179 align:start position:0%
ought to pass and I don't see that that
 
01:22:56.510 --> 01:22:56.520 align:start position:0%
would that would
 
01:22:58.490 --> 01:22:58.500 align:start position:0%
pass either this committee so I think
 
01:23:00.050 --> 01:23:00.060 align:start position:0%
retaining it and working on it this
 
01:23:02.810 --> 01:23:02.820 align:start position:0%
summer would be a good idea
 
01:23:05.450 --> 01:23:05.460 align:start position:0%
any other comments on
 
01:23:07.550 --> 01:23:07.560 align:start position:0%
emotion of ought to pass
 
01:23:10.850 --> 01:23:10.860 align:start position:0%

you ready for the question
 
01:23:14.390 --> 01:23:14.400 align:start position:0%

age
 
01:26:21.770 --> 01:26:21.780 align:start position:0%
the judicial retirement age shall be
 
01:26:24.410 --> 01:26:24.420 align:start position:0%
increased from 70 to 75. uh the chair
 
01:26:26.570 --> 01:26:26.580 align:start position:0%
recognized representative cutoff for a
 
01:26:26.580 --> 01:26:33.290 align:start position:0%
recognized representative cutoff for a
motion

01:26:33.290 --> 01:26:33.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:35.570 --> 01:26:35.580 align:start position:0%
I motion not to pass all right is there
 
01:26:37.430 --> 01:26:37.440 align:start position:0%
a second
 
01:26:38.750 --> 01:26:38.760 align:start position:0%
is there
 
01:26:41.810 --> 01:26:41.820 align:start position:0%
um discussion on the on the motion
 
01:26:41.820 --> 01:26:42.830 align:start position:0%
um discussion on the on the motion
um

01:26:42.830 --> 01:26:42.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:26:44.810 --> 01:26:44.820 align:start position:0%
I guess I would like to just briefly say
 
01:26:46.850 --> 01:26:46.860 align:start position:0%
for the reasons I've stated before I
 
01:26:49.250 --> 01:26:49.260 align:start position:0%
think that it does make sense to uh
 
01:26:51.649 --> 01:26:51.659 align:start position:0%
increase the judicial retirement age to
 
01:26:55.129 --> 01:26:55.139 align:start position:0%
75 for the reasons I said it at the
 
01:26:56.930 --> 01:26:56.940 align:start position:0%
hearing and I won't sort of belabor it
 
01:26:58.850 --> 01:26:58.860 align:start position:0%
but I'm happy to answer questions if
 
01:27:01.430 --> 01:27:01.440 align:start position:0%
anyone has wants to discuss it further
 
01:27:09.590 --> 01:27:09.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:09.600 --> 01:27:12.290 align:start position:0%

Mr chair I move that uh House Bill 63 be
 
01:29:18.350 --> 01:29:18.360 align:start position:0%
found in expedient to legislate what is
 
01:29:20.930 --> 01:29:20.940 align:start position:0%
your second to that I second the motion
 
01:29:22.490 --> 01:29:22.500 align:start position:0%
all right yes representative Greece
 
01:29:23.629 --> 01:29:23.639 align:start position:0%
would you wish to speak to us oh yes
 
01:29:25.070 --> 01:29:25.080 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:29:28.129 --> 01:29:28.139 align:start position:0%
um I I know firsthand
 
01:29:34.550 --> 01:29:34.560 align:start position:0%
that municipalities use zoning laws to
 
01:29:36.770 --> 01:29:36.780 align:start position:0%
shall we say make it extremely difficult
 
01:29:39.229 --> 01:29:39.239 align:start position:0%
for religious institutions to utilize
 
01:29:42.290 --> 01:29:42.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:44.390 --> 01:29:44.400 align:start position:0%
that being said I don't think this bill
 
01:29:47.450 --> 01:29:47.460 align:start position:0%
actually fixes that problem and May in
 
01:29:49.070 --> 01:29:49.080 align:start position:0%
fact even with the amendment that
 
01:29:51.770 --> 01:29:51.780 align:start position:0%
representative Mooney presented May in
 
01:29:53.930 --> 01:29:53.940 align:start position:0%
fact uh
 
01:29:55.790 --> 01:29:55.800 align:start position:0%
present a situation where it looks like
 
01:29:57.530 --> 01:29:57.540 align:start position:0%
religious institutions would not even be
 
01:30:00.550 --> 01:30:00.560 align:start position:0%
subject to zoning laws
 
01:30:00.560 --> 01:30:02.149 align:start position:0%
subject to zoning laws
their

01:30:02.149 --> 01:30:02.159 align:start position:0%
their
 
01:30:04.850 --> 01:30:04.860 align:start position:0%
is no explanation of what it means to
 
01:30:07.610 --> 01:30:07.620 align:start position:0%
provide housing for the unhoused how
 
01:30:09.470 --> 01:30:09.480 align:start position:0%
long are we talking about housing them
 
01:30:11.930 --> 01:30:11.940 align:start position:0%
uh what type of housing is it there's a
 
01:30:14.510 --> 01:30:14.520 align:start position:0%
difference between a a homeless shelter
 
01:30:17.990 --> 01:30:18.000 align:start position:0%
and apartment complexes or quad plexes
 
01:30:20.390 --> 01:30:20.400 align:start position:0%
or anything like such nature so because
 
01:30:22.129 --> 01:30:22.139 align:start position:0%
of some vague language and believing I'm
 
01:30:24.709 --> 01:30:24.719 align:start position:0%
sympathetic to the cause I think that
 
01:30:28.629 --> 01:30:28.639 align:start position:0%
there needs to be some assurance that
 
01:30:31.669 --> 01:30:31.679 align:start position:0%
municipalities are not using zoning laws
 
01:30:35.330 --> 01:30:35.340 align:start position:0%
to to put unnecessary uh hindrances to
 
01:30:35.340 --> 01:30:36.950 align:start position:0%
to to put unnecessary uh hindrances to
religious

01:30:36.950 --> 01:30:36.960 align:start position:0%
religious
 
01:30:38.870 --> 01:30:38.880 align:start position:0%
organizations from using exercising
 
01:30:41.030 --> 01:30:41.040 align:start position:0%
their rights but I just don't think this
 
01:30:44.510 --> 01:30:44.520 align:start position:0%
bill is actually it unfortunately
 
01:30:46.850 --> 01:30:46.860 align:start position:0%
anyone else uh yes representative Manos
 
01:30:48.890 --> 01:30:48.900 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
01:30:48.900 --> 01:30:49.610 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
um

01:30:49.610 --> 01:30:49.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:30:53.270 --> 01:30:53.280 align:start position:0%
I share concerns about the bill but for
 
01:30:55.790 --> 01:30:55.800 align:start position:0%
different reasons
 
01:30:59.209 --> 01:30:59.219 align:start position:0%
um but I was going to suggest that we
 
01:31:02.030 --> 01:31:02.040 align:start position:0%
retain it for study
 
01:31:04.129 --> 01:31:04.139 align:start position:0%
um so that we could address some of the
 
01:31:07.850 --> 01:31:07.860 align:start position:0%
issues that I think we might have as a
 
01:31:10.610 --> 01:31:10.620 align:start position:0%
committee with us I'm concerned about
 
01:31:13.129 --> 01:31:13.139 align:start position:0%
the language of substantially burden
 
01:31:15.770 --> 01:31:15.780 align:start position:0%
religious exercise and that that
 
01:31:18.890 --> 01:31:18.900 align:start position:0%
language invites litigation
 
01:31:21.290 --> 01:31:21.300 align:start position:0%
I'm concerned about the entanglement of
 
01:31:23.410 --> 01:31:23.420 align:start position:0%
church and local government
 
01:31:27.649 --> 01:31:27.659 align:start position:0%
who decides who has the burden of
 
01:31:29.169 --> 01:31:29.179 align:start position:0%
presenting evidence
 
01:31:33.110 --> 01:31:33.120 align:start position:0%
what's the burden of proof that's not
 
01:31:37.030 --> 01:31:37.040 align:start position:0%
defined in the bill and then finally
 
01:31:41.629 --> 01:31:41.639 align:start position:0%
the list that's provided is not either
 
01:31:46.510 --> 01:31:46.520 align:start position:0%
exhaustis exhaustive or all-inclusive of
 
01:31:50.110 --> 01:31:50.120 align:start position:0%
zoning regulations
 
01:31:53.570 --> 01:31:53.580 align:start position:0%
so rather than itl I would like to see
 
01:31:55.550 --> 01:31:55.560 align:start position:0%
this retained for
 
01:31:58.370 --> 01:31:58.380 align:start position:0%
um for study
 
01:31:58.380 --> 01:31:59.570 align:start position:0%
um for study
other

01:31:59.570 --> 01:31:59.580 align:start position:0%
other
 
01:32:01.490 --> 01:32:01.500 align:start position:0%
representative Oregon
 
01:32:04.310 --> 01:32:04.320 align:start position:0%
um well I'm also opposed to the itl I
 
01:32:07.610 --> 01:32:07.620 align:start position:0%
think actually my preferred option
 
01:32:10.129 --> 01:32:10.139 align:start position:0%
my preferred option is to uh Delete the
 
01:32:12.290 --> 01:32:12.300 align:start position:0%
entire RSA that this bill amends and
 
01:32:13.370 --> 01:32:13.380 align:start position:0%
that's something we can do if we
 
01:32:15.169 --> 01:32:15.179 align:start position:0%
overturn the ITIL and to move on that's
 
01:32:18.649 --> 01:32:18.659 align:start position:0%
one of our options I was uh this bill
 
01:32:20.570 --> 01:32:20.580 align:start position:0%
passed just last year and I was opposed
 
01:32:22.790 --> 01:32:22.800 align:start position:0%
to it then so I understand
 
01:32:24.649 --> 01:32:24.659 align:start position:0%
the concerns behind it but I'm not sure
 
01:32:26.810 --> 01:32:26.820 align:start position:0%
whether and it's a
 
01:32:29.510 --> 01:32:29.520 align:start position:0%
club or Association that calls herself a
 
01:32:31.310 --> 01:32:31.320 align:start position:0%
religious organization necessarily
 
01:32:33.350 --> 01:32:33.360 align:start position:0%
deserves special privileges in the
 
01:32:34.970 --> 01:32:34.980 align:start position:0%
zoning law compared to ones they call
 
01:32:37.790 --> 01:32:37.800 align:start position:0%
themselves secular uh organizations I
 
01:32:40.070 --> 01:32:40.080 align:start position:0%
think there's a
 
01:32:41.330 --> 01:32:41.340 align:start position:0%
I sort of think there's a First
 
01:32:43.010 --> 01:32:43.020 align:start position:0%
Amendment issue here and also the
 
01:32:44.870 --> 01:32:44.880 align:start position:0%
original Bill 2 is also is an anecdote
 
01:32:46.729 --> 01:32:46.739 align:start position:0%
to evolving particular religious
 
01:32:48.410 --> 01:32:48.420 align:start position:0%
organization in Durham and I'm not sure
 
01:32:51.530 --> 01:32:51.540 align:start position:0%
whether that anecdote was uh accurate I
 
01:32:53.510 --> 01:32:53.520 align:start position:0%
guess that's in the past but I think
 
01:32:55.430 --> 01:32:55.440 align:start position:0%
so my preferred option
 
01:32:58.129 --> 01:32:58.139 align:start position:0%
retaining is preferable to uh
 
01:33:00.649 --> 01:33:00.659 align:start position:0%
leaving it as is but leaving the law as
 
01:33:02.330 --> 01:33:02.340 align:start position:0%
is but I think my preferred option would
 
01:33:03.950 --> 01:33:03.960 align:start position:0%
be just to delete the entire RSA
 
01:33:05.510 --> 01:33:05.520 align:start position:0%
although I know that's probably pretty
 
01:33:08.209 --> 01:33:08.219 align:start position:0%
pretty heavy lift given that given where
 
01:33:09.649 --> 01:33:09.659 align:start position:0%
the rest of the committee is but that's
 
01:33:09.659 --> 01:33:10.669 align:start position:0%
the rest of the committee is but that's
uh

01:33:10.669 --> 01:33:10.679 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:33:12.890 --> 01:33:12.900 align:start position:0%
so I'm voting uh so I'll be voting
 
01:33:16.610 --> 01:33:16.620 align:start position:0%
against the itl for that reason yes uh
 
01:33:19.129 --> 01:33:19.139 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry yes representative Char yeah
 
01:33:19.139 --> 01:33:20.030 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry yes representative Char yeah
thanks

01:33:20.030 --> 01:33:20.040 align:start position:0%
thanks
 
01:33:22.129 --> 01:33:22.139 align:start position:0%
um so I
 
01:33:27.110 --> 01:33:27.120 align:start position:0%
also like the idea of retaining the bill
 
01:33:31.010 --> 01:33:31.020 align:start position:0%
because I think the uh existing
 
01:33:33.649 --> 01:33:33.659 align:start position:0%
statute as I read it does have some
 
01:33:35.870 --> 01:33:35.880 align:start position:0%
flaws one of one of the zoning board
 
01:33:38.209 --> 01:33:38.219 align:start position:0%
members Maguire I think that came and
 
01:33:41.629 --> 01:33:41.639 align:start position:0%
spoke to us said listed that existing
 
01:33:43.370 --> 01:33:43.380 align:start position:0%
law the exemption the exemptions that
 
01:33:45.050 --> 01:33:45.060 align:start position:0%
are listed because it basically granted
 
01:33:46.550 --> 01:33:46.560 align:start position:0%
and then says except for all of these
 
01:33:48.970 --> 01:33:48.980 align:start position:0%
things which are most basic zoning
 
01:33:51.709 --> 01:33:51.719 align:start position:0%
regulations don't apply and he said that
 
01:33:53.930 --> 01:33:53.940 align:start position:0%
list was not comprehensive so I think
 
01:33:57.229 --> 01:33:57.239 align:start position:0%
there's flaws with the current law but
 
01:34:00.350 --> 01:34:00.360 align:start position:0%
the new law I like the fact that it
 
01:34:03.709 --> 01:34:03.719 align:start position:0%
narrowed it and said you you can't pass
 
01:34:06.350 --> 01:34:06.360 align:start position:0%
a restriction that is solely on the base
 
01:34:09.770 --> 01:34:09.780 align:start position:0%
of basis of religious purpose whereas
 
01:34:11.390 --> 01:34:11.400 align:start position:0%
the existing law
 
01:34:13.790 --> 01:34:13.800 align:start position:0%
basically grants it based on the fact
 
01:34:15.470 --> 01:34:15.480 align:start position:0%
that the building itself is currently
 
01:34:17.689 --> 01:34:17.699 align:start position:0%
being used for religious purposes so
 
01:34:19.610 --> 01:34:19.620 align:start position:0%
it's a very different concept than what
 
01:34:22.550 --> 01:34:22.560 align:start position:0%
the what the the bill said the bill I
 
01:34:25.430 --> 01:34:25.440 align:start position:0%
liked better but the existing law
 
01:34:28.010 --> 01:34:28.020 align:start position:0%
um has uh holes in it and so does the
 
01:34:30.470 --> 01:34:30.480 align:start position:0%
bill so that's why I would think routine
 
01:34:32.930 --> 01:34:32.940 align:start position:0%
other anyone else uh representative
 
01:34:32.940 --> 01:34:34.310 align:start position:0%
other anyone else uh representative
Smith

01:34:34.310 --> 01:34:34.320 align:start position:0%
Smith
 
01:34:36.950 --> 01:34:36.960 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
01:34:36.960 --> 01:34:38.750 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
um

01:34:38.750 --> 01:34:38.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:34:42.350 --> 01:34:42.360 align:start position:0%
all of us know that
 
01:34:44.390 --> 01:34:44.400 align:start position:0%
we are
 
01:34:46.850 --> 01:34:46.860 align:start position:0%
not just in New Hampshire but across the
 
01:34:49.490 --> 01:34:49.500 align:start position:0%
country experiencing
 
01:34:53.330 --> 01:34:53.340 align:start position:0%
um a very serious problem in terms of
 
01:34:57.010 --> 01:34:57.020 align:start position:0%
access to housing
 
01:35:03.050 --> 01:35:03.060 align:start position:0%
and we can come up with Myriad reasons
 
01:35:03.060 --> 01:35:04.370 align:start position:0%
and we can come up with Myriad reasons
uh

01:35:04.370 --> 01:35:04.380 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:35:06.649 --> 01:35:06.659 align:start position:0%
for that uh
 
01:35:09.530 --> 01:35:09.540 align:start position:0%
but as to for Solutions I think we're
 
01:35:11.229 --> 01:35:11.239 align:start position:0%
all now looking at representative
 
01:35:13.850 --> 01:35:13.860 align:start position:0%
Alexander's committee to tell us what
 
01:35:17.570 --> 01:35:17.580 align:start position:0%
the solutions are so it's all on his
 
01:35:20.750 --> 01:35:20.760 align:start position:0%
strong shoulders
 
01:35:23.149 --> 01:35:23.159 align:start position:0%
and when he comes up with that people
 
01:35:24.950 --> 01:35:24.960 align:start position:0%
all across the nation are going to be
 
01:35:24.960 --> 01:35:26.450 align:start position:0%
all across the nation are going to be
cheering

01:35:26.450 --> 01:35:26.460 align:start position:0%
cheering
 
01:35:29.930 --> 01:35:29.940 align:start position:0%
um the I I share with representative
 
01:35:32.209 --> 01:35:32.219 align:start position:0%
hurricane concerns about the initial
 
01:35:35.990 --> 01:35:36.000 align:start position:0%
bill that passed uh last time this is
 
01:35:39.169 --> 01:35:39.179 align:start position:0%
now an attempt to try to correct some of
 
01:35:41.149 --> 01:35:41.159 align:start position:0%
the problems
 
01:35:41.159 --> 01:35:42.050 align:start position:0%
the problems
um

01:35:42.050 --> 01:35:42.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:35:46.310 --> 01:35:46.320 align:start position:0%
but there are so many more problems
 
01:35:46.320 --> 01:35:47.229 align:start position:0%
but there are so many more problems
um

01:35:47.229 --> 01:35:47.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:35:51.709 --> 01:35:51.719 align:start position:0%
that exist so the bill itself isn't the
 
01:35:51.719 --> 01:35:52.610 align:start position:0%
that exist so the bill itself isn't the
answer

01:35:52.610 --> 01:35:52.620 align:start position:0%
answer
 
01:35:55.149 --> 01:35:55.159 align:start position:0%
but I don't think leaving
 
01:35:59.930 --> 01:35:59.940 align:start position:0%
the underlying legislation as it is is
 
01:36:02.390 --> 01:36:02.400 align:start position:0%
the answer either
 
01:36:05.629 --> 01:36:05.639 align:start position:0%
um there is nothing that
 
01:36:09.050 --> 01:36:09.060 align:start position:0%
would make a time difference if we were
 
01:36:13.270 --> 01:36:13.280 align:start position:0%
to act on this now or not
 
01:36:17.270 --> 01:36:17.280 align:start position:0%
itl just closes the issue I would like
 
01:36:20.510 --> 01:36:20.520 align:start position:0%
us to keep the issue open in this
 
01:36:23.270 --> 01:36:23.280 align:start position:0%
committee because we have a
 
01:36:26.590 --> 01:36:26.600 align:start position:0%
responsibility as do other committees
 
01:36:29.930 --> 01:36:29.940 align:start position:0%
to address some of these issues and by
 
01:36:32.689 --> 01:36:32.699 align:start position:0%
retaining the bill we create an
 
01:36:35.649 --> 01:36:35.659 align:start position:0%
opportunity for us to do some thinking
 
01:36:38.870 --> 01:36:38.880 align:start position:0%
some deep diving if that's the
 
01:36:41.990 --> 01:36:42.000 align:start position:0%
appropriate expression and see if we can
 
01:36:45.010 --> 01:36:45.020 align:start position:0%
actually come up with legislation
 
01:36:49.129 --> 01:36:49.139 align:start position:0%
that addresses the problem and meanwhile
 
01:36:52.250 --> 01:36:52.260 align:start position:0%
we won't be adding to the problem by
 
01:36:55.250 --> 01:36:55.260 align:start position:0%
just ignoring it so I would hope that
 
01:36:58.610 --> 01:36:58.620 align:start position:0%
you would consider the possibility of
 
01:37:03.470 --> 01:37:03.480 align:start position:0%
not accepting the itl motion and uh then
 
01:37:06.890 --> 01:37:06.900 align:start position:0%
giving some consideration to a motion to
 
01:37:06.900 --> 01:37:07.850 align:start position:0%
giving some consideration to a motion to
retain

01:37:07.850 --> 01:37:07.860 align:start position:0%
retain
 
01:37:10.790 --> 01:37:10.800 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
01:37:14.149 --> 01:37:14.159 align:start position:0%
um other yes uh thank you Mr chair
 
01:37:16.070 --> 01:37:16.080 align:start position:0%
um as a co-sponsor of this bill and a
 
01:37:18.189 --> 01:37:18.199 align:start position:0%
supporter of the amendment I also
 
01:37:21.530 --> 01:37:21.540 align:start position:0%
support retaining it so that the
 
01:37:23.810 --> 01:37:23.820 align:start position:0%
sponsors can have a discussion because I
 
01:37:26.050 --> 01:37:26.060 align:start position:0%
think we're getting in
 
01:37:28.970 --> 01:37:28.980 align:start position:0%
not only with current legislation but
 
01:37:31.490 --> 01:37:31.500 align:start position:0%
we're talking about property rights and
 
01:37:34.189 --> 01:37:34.199 align:start position:0%
the separation of church and state to
 
01:37:35.990 --> 01:37:36.000 align:start position:0%
address one of the most severe problems
 
01:37:37.669 --> 01:37:37.679 align:start position:0%
facing New Hampshire and throughout the
 
01:37:40.010 --> 01:37:40.020 align:start position:0%
country so I think retaining it can
 
01:37:42.350 --> 01:37:42.360 align:start position:0%
bring in some voices and dive deeper
 
01:37:45.290 --> 01:37:45.300 align:start position:0%
into this issue thank you
 
01:37:48.169 --> 01:37:48.179 align:start position:0%
anyone else yes representative De
 
01:37:50.149 --> 01:37:50.159 align:start position:0%
Lorenzo thank you Mr Claire I am in
 
01:37:53.149 --> 01:37:53.159 align:start position:0%
favor of retaining it uh mainly because
 
01:37:56.149 --> 01:37:56.159 align:start position:0%
I went online to look at
 
01:37:58.970 --> 01:37:58.980 align:start position:0%
um the opposition and support of the
 
01:38:02.030 --> 01:38:02.040 align:start position:0%
bill for the from the public and one
 
01:38:04.430 --> 01:38:04.440 align:start position:0%
person supported it and 370 people
 
01:38:07.550 --> 01:38:07.560 align:start position:0%
opposed it so I think that I would love
 
01:38:09.290 --> 01:38:09.300 align:start position:0%
to see a deeper dive into this issue
 
01:38:10.550 --> 01:38:10.560 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:38:12.890 --> 01:38:12.900 align:start position:0%
other other comments yes representative
 
01:38:15.229 --> 01:38:15.239 align:start position:0%
Stapleton thank you Mr chair
 
01:38:17.450 --> 01:38:17.460 align:start position:0%
I personally don't have a problem with
 
01:38:20.209 --> 01:38:20.219 align:start position:0%
RSA 674.
 
01:38:23.090 --> 01:38:23.100 align:start position:0%
and the last sentence in the bill was
 
01:38:24.950 --> 01:38:24.960 align:start position:0%
displayed the building of housing to
 
01:38:26.750 --> 01:38:26.760 align:start position:0%
house the unhoused by a religious
 
01:38:26.760 --> 01:38:28.310 align:start position:0%
house the unhoused by a religious
organization

01:38:28.310 --> 01:38:28.320 align:start position:0%
organization
 
01:38:30.890 --> 01:38:30.900 align:start position:0%
shall qualify as religious exercise
 
01:38:33.530 --> 01:38:33.540 align:start position:0%
under this section
 
01:38:36.129 --> 01:38:36.139 align:start position:0%
well it's a form of Charity
 
01:38:40.189 --> 01:38:40.199 align:start position:0%
religions of all types and kinds
 
01:38:43.669 --> 01:38:43.679 align:start position:0%
do charitable work for Humanity and and
 
01:38:45.410 --> 01:38:45.420 align:start position:0%
other people not only of their own
 
01:38:48.410 --> 01:38:48.420 align:start position:0%
denomination but generally others and if
 
01:38:50.149 --> 01:38:50.159 align:start position:0%
they want to build housing they've got
 
01:38:50.159 --> 01:38:52.610 align:start position:0%
they want to build housing they've got
permit

01:38:52.610 --> 01:38:52.620 align:start position:0%
permit
 
01:38:52.620 --> 01:38:53.629 align:start position:0%
permit
um

01:38:53.629 --> 01:38:53.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:38:56.270 --> 01:38:56.280 align:start position:0%
and compliance with code
 
01:38:59.990 --> 01:39:00.000 align:start position:0%
and compliance with existing statutes
 
01:39:02.930 --> 01:39:02.940 align:start position:0%
and areas of housing or
 
01:39:04.970 --> 01:39:04.980 align:start position:0%
medical or whatever is going to be
 
01:39:07.850 --> 01:39:07.860 align:start position:0%
involved with the building so I think we
 
01:39:09.530 --> 01:39:09.540 align:start position:0%
have a body of law that adequately
 
01:39:12.350 --> 01:39:12.360 align:start position:0%
covers how that charity can be
 
01:39:16.189 --> 01:39:16.199 align:start position:0%
manifested under religious charity right
 
01:39:19.790 --> 01:39:19.800 align:start position:0%
other comments but I would be okay with
 
01:39:22.070 --> 01:39:22.080 align:start position:0%
retain because it gives think time and I
 
01:39:23.870 --> 01:39:23.880 align:start position:0%
think this is a big enough
 
01:39:27.530 --> 01:39:27.540 align:start position:0%
item that it requires think time if not
 
01:39:28.729 --> 01:39:28.739 align:start position:0%
a lot of it
 
01:39:30.770 --> 01:39:30.780 align:start position:0%
right well so I guess what what I would
 
01:39:33.830 --> 01:39:33.840 align:start position:0%
say is this I I don't disagree with the
 
01:39:36.350 --> 01:39:36.360 align:start position:0%
people that say we should that this
 
01:39:39.050 --> 01:39:39.060 align:start position:0%
requires some further work but my
 
01:39:41.629 --> 01:39:41.639 align:start position:0%
concern is it seems to me that it
 
01:39:45.290 --> 01:39:45.300 align:start position:0%
requires enough for the work so to speak
 
01:39:45.300 --> 01:39:46.729 align:start position:0%
requires enough for the work so to speak
that

01:39:46.729 --> 01:39:46.739 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:39:48.530 --> 01:39:48.540 align:start position:0%
um it's unlikely we're going to get this
 
01:39:51.169 --> 01:39:51.179 align:start position:0%
done and sort of a retained situation I
 
01:39:54.470 --> 01:39:54.480 align:start position:0%
to me the people who uh who have
 
01:39:56.450 --> 01:39:56.460 align:start position:0%
questions about you know should it be
 
01:39:58.910 --> 01:39:58.920 align:start position:0%
changed in one way or another and I I I
 
01:40:01.970 --> 01:40:01.980 align:start position:0%
tend to agree with representative Smith
 
01:40:04.070 --> 01:40:04.080 align:start position:0%
that there are some issues
 
01:40:04.080 --> 01:40:04.669 align:start position:0%
that there are some issues
um

01:40:04.669 --> 01:40:04.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:40:06.950 --> 01:40:06.960 align:start position:0%
with at least some parts of the of the
 
01:40:09.350 --> 01:40:09.360 align:start position:0%
of the current law uh but it seems to me
 
01:40:11.510 --> 01:40:11.520 align:start position:0%
that there's nothing that would prevent
 
01:40:13.910 --> 01:40:13.920 align:start position:0%
this from you know from uh in the next
 
01:40:16.129 --> 01:40:16.139 align:start position:0%
session next year somebody coming back
 
01:40:20.750 --> 01:40:20.760 align:start position:0%
with a bill to uh to uh uh change the
 
01:40:24.350 --> 01:40:24.360 align:start position:0%
the uh to change the law if there's if
 
01:40:25.850 --> 01:40:25.860 align:start position:0%
there's uh
 
01:40:28.010 --> 01:40:28.020 align:start position:0%
some reason to do so
 
01:40:30.830 --> 01:40:30.840 align:start position:0%
um as I say that I guess maybe I ask is
 
01:40:33.290 --> 01:40:33.300 align:start position:0%
that will the would there would that are
 
01:40:35.450 --> 01:40:35.460 align:start position:0%
you concerned that if we if we did that
 
01:40:38.810 --> 01:40:38.820 align:start position:0%
that there would be a uh we would be
 
01:40:40.430 --> 01:40:40.440 align:start position:0%
prohibited from doing that in the next
 
01:40:43.370 --> 01:40:43.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:43.380 --> 01:40:46.550 align:start position:0%
 
right

01:40:46.550 --> 01:40:46.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:48.890 --> 01:40:48.900 align:start position:0%
anything anything to do with that we
 
01:40:50.149 --> 01:40:50.159 align:start position:0%
would have to
 
01:40:52.790 --> 01:40:52.800 align:start position:0%
have we substantively different to bring
 
01:40:54.290 --> 01:40:54.300 align:start position:0%
it back
 
01:40:56.810 --> 01:40:56.820 align:start position:0%
right okay okay and I but I mean it's it
 
01:40:59.450 --> 01:40:59.460 align:start position:0%
sounds it sounds like what we're really
 
01:41:01.430 --> 01:41:01.440 align:start position:0%
talking about are substantively
 
01:41:03.490 --> 01:41:03.500 align:start position:0%
different things aren't they isn't that
 
01:41:15.590 --> 01:41:15.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:19.729 --> 01:41:19.739 align:start position:0%
just feel that I listened carefully to
 
01:41:22.129 --> 01:41:22.139 align:start position:0%
what representative Stapleton said
 
01:41:25.610 --> 01:41:25.620 align:start position:0%
because I think he made some very good
 
01:41:29.870 --> 01:41:29.880 align:start position:0%
points in his statement and
 
01:41:33.189 --> 01:41:33.199 align:start position:0%
um he was reading from this language
 
01:41:37.910 --> 01:41:37.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:39.169 --> 01:41:39.179 align:start position:0%
you know that he thought it was
 
01:41:42.410 --> 01:41:42.420 align:start position:0%
appropriate as a charitable operation of
 
01:41:45.590 --> 01:41:45.600 align:start position:0%
a of a religious institution to address
 
01:41:48.770 --> 01:41:48.780 align:start position:0%
the housing issue I
 
01:41:53.450 --> 01:41:53.460 align:start position:0%
too agree with him which is why itl
 
01:41:55.370 --> 01:41:55.380 align:start position:0%
on this bill
 
01:41:58.310 --> 01:41:58.320 align:start position:0%
is there some concern to me because that
 
01:42:01.790 --> 01:42:01.800 align:start position:0%
language then disappears
 
01:42:04.970 --> 01:42:04.980 align:start position:0%
um and we are left with the existing
 
01:42:09.169 --> 01:42:09.179 align:start position:0%
language which isn't as focused as this
 
01:42:11.270 --> 01:42:11.280 align:start position:0%
and so
 
01:42:11.280 --> 01:42:13.609 align:start position:0%
and so
um

01:42:13.609 --> 01:42:13.619 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:16.430 --> 01:42:16.440 align:start position:0%
I I think
 
01:42:19.250 --> 01:42:19.260 align:start position:0%
uh I mean not Dakota
 
01:42:21.890 --> 01:42:21.900 align:start position:0%
former president but I feel everyone's
 
01:42:26.090 --> 01:42:26.100 align:start position:0%
pain on this on this uh on this issue
 
01:42:29.030 --> 01:42:29.040 align:start position:0%
and I I would like to take
 
01:42:32.090 --> 01:42:32.100 align:start position:0%
a crack and see if the Judiciary
 
01:42:35.450 --> 01:42:35.460 align:start position:0%
Committee which has limited Authority in
 
01:42:37.550 --> 01:42:37.560 align:start position:0%
terms of housing issues after all we
 
01:42:39.530 --> 01:42:39.540 align:start position:0%
don't have Planning and Zoning we're not
 
01:42:42.109 --> 01:42:42.119 align:start position:0%
the municipal committee
 
01:42:42.119 --> 01:42:44.209 align:start position:0%
the municipal committee
um

01:42:44.209 --> 01:42:44.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:46.850 --> 01:42:46.860 align:start position:0%
uh I I would like to see if there's a
 
01:42:48.709 --> 01:42:48.719 align:start position:0%
little piece of it that we might
 
01:42:53.270 --> 01:42:53.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:55.729 --> 01:42:55.739 align:start position:0%
the problem until we could come up until
 
01:42:58.250 --> 01:42:58.260 align:start position:0%
representative Alexander sauce the whole
 
01:43:00.709 --> 01:43:00.719 align:start position:0%
thing for us and to be fair
 
01:43:02.149 --> 01:43:02.159 align:start position:0%
representative De Lorenzo will be
 
01:43:04.189 --> 01:43:04.199 align:start position:0%
solving it as well
 
01:43:09.370 --> 01:43:09.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:11.990 --> 01:43:12.000 align:start position:0%
representative Lorenzo is that
 
01:43:14.090 --> 01:43:14.100 align:start position:0%
representative Lorenzo would be happy to
 
01:43:18.370 --> 01:43:18.380 align:start position:0%
let representative Alexander take over
 
01:43:20.870 --> 01:43:20.880 align:start position:0%
Mr chair if it's appropriate at this
 
01:43:25.370 --> 01:43:25.380 align:start position:0%
time I would withdraw the motion to itl
 
01:43:27.950 --> 01:43:27.960 align:start position:0%
and make a motion to retain
 
01:43:31.310 --> 01:43:31.320 align:start position:0%
house bill 63. before you do that let me
 
01:43:32.750 --> 01:43:32.760 align:start position:0%
just hear from representative Macbeth
 
01:43:34.490 --> 01:43:34.500 align:start position:0%
and then I will get to you
 
01:43:37.129 --> 01:43:37.139 align:start position:0%
so I greatly respect my ranking member
 
01:43:40.850 --> 01:43:40.860 align:start position:0%
and I um I really I feel like itl is the
 
01:43:40.860 --> 01:43:41.810 align:start position:0%
and I um I really I feel like itl is the
best

01:43:41.810 --> 01:43:41.820 align:start position:0%
best
 
01:43:41.820 --> 01:43:43.010 align:start position:0%
best
um

01:43:43.010 --> 01:43:43.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:43:46.070 --> 01:43:46.080 align:start position:0%
vote for this bill we have the housing
 
01:43:46.080 --> 01:43:46.790 align:start position:0%
vote for this bill we have the housing
um

01:43:46.790 --> 01:43:46.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:43:49.490 --> 01:43:49.500 align:start position:0%
committee special and we I think we
 
01:43:51.649 --> 01:43:51.659 align:start position:0%
should let that take its course
 
01:43:54.470 --> 01:43:54.480 align:start position:0%
um I also think the issues regarding
 
01:43:56.750 --> 01:43:56.760 align:start position:0%
um separation of church and state are
 
01:43:59.030 --> 01:43:59.040 align:start position:0%
significant and
 
01:44:02.030 --> 01:44:02.040 align:start position:0%
um that's something that's going to need
 
01:44:04.189 --> 01:44:04.199 align:start position:0%
to a lot of work and as representative
 
01:44:06.290 --> 01:44:06.300 align:start position:0%
Smith said housing really is not our
 
01:44:08.689 --> 01:44:08.699 align:start position:0%
main peer review so I would like this
 
01:44:11.090 --> 01:44:11.100 align:start position:0%
bill could come back whenever but I
 
01:44:12.229 --> 01:44:12.239 align:start position:0%
first of all would like the housing
 
01:44:15.890 --> 01:44:15.900 align:start position:0%
committee to do its work and then
 
01:44:17.810 --> 01:44:17.820 align:start position:0%
um you know if somebody wants to bring
 
01:44:19.310 --> 01:44:19.320 align:start position:0%
it back they can but I I really think
 
01:44:22.250 --> 01:44:22.260 align:start position:0%
itl is the best right so representative
 
01:44:24.109 --> 01:44:24.119 align:start position:0%
Gleason in light of what uh
 
01:44:27.229 --> 01:44:27.239 align:start position:0%
representative Macbeth has said uh does
 
01:44:30.410 --> 01:44:30.420 align:start position:0%
that what do you still wish to withdraw
 
01:44:33.169 --> 01:44:33.179 align:start position:0%
your I know that the motion was made and
 
01:44:33.179 --> 01:44:34.310 align:start position:0%
your I know that the motion was made and
seconded

01:44:34.310 --> 01:44:34.320 align:start position:0%
seconded
 
01:44:36.350 --> 01:44:36.360 align:start position:0%
so it would also have to be agreed to by
 
01:44:39.229 --> 01:44:39.239 align:start position:0%
the one who seconds it I think because
 
01:44:42.470 --> 01:44:42.480 align:start position:0%
of the fact that this is such a huge
 
01:44:44.330 --> 01:44:44.340 align:start position:0%
scope problem
 
01:44:47.510 --> 01:44:47.520 align:start position:0%
I do believe itl is the appropriate
 
01:44:49.490 --> 01:44:49.500 align:start position:0%
motion and the proper action to take it
 
01:44:51.770 --> 01:44:51.780 align:start position:0%
this is this is way too big of a problem
 
01:44:54.530 --> 01:44:54.540 align:start position:0%
for this committee to try to solve even
 
01:44:55.970 --> 01:44:55.980 align:start position:0%
over the summer as best of our
 
01:44:57.890 --> 01:44:57.900 align:start position:0%
intentions maybe if we have a commission
 
01:44:59.629 --> 01:44:59.639 align:start position:0%
to study this and to try to come up with
 
01:45:00.950 --> 01:45:00.960 align:start position:0%
something what makes it think that we're
 
01:45:01.970 --> 01:45:01.980 align:start position:0%
going to come up with it over the summer
 
01:45:04.729 --> 01:45:04.739 align:start position:0%
time I think itl is the appropriate
 
01:45:06.530 --> 01:45:06.540 align:start position:0%
motion and if the one who who at seconds
 
01:45:10.010 --> 01:45:10.020 align:start position:0%
it would still keep the second
 
01:45:11.689 --> 01:45:11.699 align:start position:0%
um then then I think the motion should
 
01:45:13.970 --> 01:45:13.980 align:start position:0%
stay itl and let's go with a vote for
 
01:45:16.370 --> 01:45:16.380 align:start position:0%
that if it fails I'll make the motion to
 
01:45:19.669 --> 01:45:19.679 align:start position:0%
retain all right so that you you
 
01:45:22.490 --> 01:45:22.500 align:start position:0%
your thinking is exactly my thinking I I
 
01:45:24.950 --> 01:45:24.960 align:start position:0%
tend to think I I tend to think that we
 
01:45:24.960 --> 01:45:25.729 align:start position:0%
tend to think I I tend to think that we
should

01:45:25.729 --> 01:45:25.739 align:start position:0%
should
 
01:45:28.609 --> 01:45:28.619 align:start position:0%
uh itl this for the reasons that's been
 
01:45:31.729 --> 01:45:31.739 align:start position:0%
stated but but if that fails I will I
 
01:45:33.169 --> 01:45:33.179 align:start position:0%
will also be voting with representative
 
01:45:35.330 --> 01:45:35.340 align:start position:0%
griesen to retain it so are we ready for
 
01:45:37.070 --> 01:45:37.080 align:start position:0%
the question on itl
 
01:45:40.010 --> 01:45:40.020 align:start position:0%
any further discussion all right I asked
 
01:45:41.750 --> 01:45:41.760 align:start position:0%

01:47:56.629 --> 01:47:56.639 align:start position:0%
today is House Bill 256 uh prohibiting
 
01:47:59.330 --> 01:47:59.340 align:start position:0%
cities and towns from discriminating in
 
01:48:02.229 --> 01:48:02.239 align:start position:0%
the use of public facilities
 
01:48:05.270 --> 01:48:05.280 align:start position:0%
and I will recognize myself for a motion
 
01:48:08.830 --> 01:48:08.840 align:start position:0%
on that and and present um
 
01:48:11.750 --> 01:48:11.760 align:start position:0%
uh first an amendment which you all
 
01:48:18.169 --> 01:48:18.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:18.179 --> 01:48:18.890 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:48:18.890 --> 01:48:18.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:48:21.350 --> 01:48:21.360 align:start position:0%
which um
 
01:48:25.370 --> 01:48:25.380 align:start position:0%
you'll see it it I think it clears up at
 
01:48:27.830 --> 01:48:27.840 align:start position:0%
least in my mind it clears up what I
 
01:48:29.450 --> 01:48:29.460 align:start position:0%
thought was
 
01:48:29.460 --> 01:48:31.850 align:start position:0%
thought was
um

01:48:31.850 --> 01:48:31.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:34.729 --> 01:48:34.739 align:start position:0%
some troubling language in the original
 
01:48:36.890 --> 01:48:36.900 align:start position:0%
bill I should say that I've discussed
 
01:48:40.189 --> 01:48:40.199 align:start position:0%
this um with the uh with uh
 
01:48:43.070 --> 01:48:43.080 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire who was the Prime
 
01:48:45.290 --> 01:48:45.300 align:start position:0%
sponsor of the bill and he was fine with
 
01:48:47.090 --> 01:48:47.100 align:start position:0%
this language
 
01:48:50.649 --> 01:48:50.659 align:start position:0%
um it's designed basically to say
 
01:48:53.209 --> 01:48:53.219 align:start position:0%
that um
 
01:48:54.709 --> 01:48:54.719 align:start position:0%
well let me let me just read no
 
01:48:56.330 --> 01:48:56.340 align:start position:0%
municipality shall discriminate against
 
01:48:59.109 --> 01:48:59.119 align:start position:0%
any individual or group in the use of
 
01:49:01.550 --> 01:49:01.560 align:start position:0%
Municipal facilities for a lawful
 
01:49:03.950 --> 01:49:03.960 align:start position:0%
purpose so it's got to be a lawful
 
01:49:06.410 --> 01:49:06.420 align:start position:0%
purpose if you're you know if you're
 
01:49:08.930 --> 01:49:08.940 align:start position:0%
if if you're proposing to hold a meeting
 
01:49:12.410 --> 01:49:12.420 align:start position:0%
to talk about Let's uh uh let's
 
01:49:14.330 --> 01:49:14.340 align:start position:0%
overthrow the government
 
01:49:18.169 --> 01:49:18.179 align:start position:0%
um or let's uh let's go burn uh down
 
01:49:21.350 --> 01:49:21.360 align:start position:0%
some uh some houses in some neighborhood
 
01:49:24.050 --> 01:49:24.060 align:start position:0%
that's not a lawful purpose but assuming
 
01:49:25.729 --> 01:49:25.739 align:start position:0%
it's a lawful purpose there can be no
 
01:49:25.739 --> 01:49:27.290 align:start position:0%
it's a lawful purpose there can be no
discrimination

01:49:27.290 --> 01:49:27.300 align:start position:0%
discrimination
 
01:49:29.510 --> 01:49:29.520 align:start position:0%
on the basis of the subject matter to be
 
01:49:31.550 --> 01:49:31.560 align:start position:0%
addressed or the Viewpoint to be
 
01:49:34.669 --> 01:49:34.679 align:start position:0%
expressed by the individual or group it
 
01:49:36.350 --> 01:49:36.360 align:start position:0%
goes on to say that a municipality May
 
01:49:38.709 --> 01:49:38.719 align:start position:0%
however impose reasonable and
 
01:49:41.689 --> 01:49:41.699 align:start position:0%
non-discriminatory time place and manner
 
01:49:44.570 --> 01:49:44.580 align:start position:0%
restrictions on such use and assess
 
01:49:46.129 --> 01:49:46.139 align:start position:0%
reasonable fee this was another point
 
01:49:48.050 --> 01:49:48.060 align:start position:0%
that was not in the original Bill and
 
01:49:50.050 --> 01:49:50.060 align:start position:0%
assessed reasonable fees for the use
 
01:49:52.550 --> 01:49:52.560 align:start position:0%
provided that such restrictions and fees
 
01:49:56.030 --> 01:49:56.040 align:start position:0%
are applied equally to all users of the
 
01:49:56.040 --> 01:49:57.109 align:start position:0%
are applied equally to all users of the
facilities

01:49:57.109 --> 01:49:57.119 align:start position:0%
facilities
 
01:49:59.990 --> 01:50:00.000 align:start position:0%
um it seems to me that that's that you
 
01:50:00.950 --> 01:50:00.960 align:start position:0%
know that
 
01:50:03.350 --> 01:50:03.360 align:start position:0%
that language the the time place and
 
01:50:05.450 --> 01:50:05.460 align:start position:0%
manner allowance of those kind of
 
01:50:05.460 --> 01:50:06.950 align:start position:0%
manner allowance of those kind of
restrictions

01:50:06.950 --> 01:50:06.960 align:start position:0%
restrictions
 
01:50:08.930 --> 01:50:08.940 align:start position:0%
um makes sense it's certainly the
 
01:50:11.570 --> 01:50:11.580 align:start position:0%
Constitution would allow that and so I
 
01:50:14.330 --> 01:50:14.340 align:start position:0%
think that this does this will help to
 
01:50:17.510 --> 01:50:17.520 align:start position:0%
ensure that uh municipalities sort of
 
01:50:20.689 --> 01:50:20.699 align:start position:0%
treat everyone equally and don't have a
 
01:50:23.570 --> 01:50:23.580 align:start position:0%
situation where you know if you have if
 
01:50:25.910 --> 01:50:25.920 align:start position:0%
you have this Viewpoint
 
01:50:28.010 --> 01:50:28.020 align:start position:0%
um it's okay to have uh to use public
 
01:50:29.570 --> 01:50:29.580 align:start position:0%
facilities but if you have that
 
01:50:31.550 --> 01:50:31.560 align:start position:0%
Viewpoint it's not
 
01:50:33.649 --> 01:50:33.659 align:start position:0%
um so I for those reasons I think it's
 
01:50:37.129 --> 01:50:37.139 align:start position:0%
uh I I hope that you will support uh I
 
01:50:40.189 --> 01:50:40.199 align:start position:0%
hope you will support this amendment
 
01:50:43.250 --> 01:50:43.260 align:start position:0%
yes representative Macbeth so thank you
 
01:50:45.109 --> 01:50:45.119 align:start position:0%
um so I have two questions one you said
 
01:50:46.910 --> 01:50:46.920 align:start position:0%
used example not overthrowing the
 
01:50:48.530 --> 01:50:48.540 align:start position:0%
government but I doesn't our
 
01:50:48.540 --> 01:50:49.970 align:start position:0%
government but I doesn't our
constitution

01:50:49.970 --> 01:50:49.980 align:start position:0%
constitution
 
01:50:52.570 --> 01:50:52.580 align:start position:0%
guarantee the right to have Revolution
 
01:50:55.430 --> 01:50:55.440 align:start position:0%
and I mean and I I'm I'm asking you
 
01:50:57.530 --> 01:50:57.540 align:start position:0%
because you're the expert and then also
 
01:51:01.250 --> 01:51:01.260 align:start position:0%
so I'm concerned about lawful speech
 
01:51:02.750 --> 01:51:02.760 align:start position:0%
because I mean
 
01:51:05.629 --> 01:51:05.639 align:start position:0%
um the right to be anti-holocaust or I
 
01:51:07.490 --> 01:51:07.500 align:start position:0%
mean all of that's lawful but that might
 
01:51:09.410 --> 01:51:09.420 align:start position:0%
not that's you know
 
01:51:11.390 --> 01:51:11.400 align:start position:0%
it was all right so that can't be
 
01:51:13.790 --> 01:51:13.800 align:start position:0%
discriminated against and the town has
 
01:51:17.330 --> 01:51:17.340 align:start position:0%
to allow the neo-nazis or
 
01:51:20.570 --> 01:51:20.580 align:start position:0%
um whatever anybody well you know I I'm
 
01:51:22.430 --> 01:51:22.440 align:start position:0%
not that's an excellent question I think
 
01:51:25.689 --> 01:51:25.699 align:start position:0%
it on the on the right to Revolution
 
01:51:28.550 --> 01:51:28.560 align:start position:0%
you know that that's that is in the in
 
01:51:30.290 --> 01:51:30.300 align:start position:0%
our constitution it's not in the federal
 
01:51:32.390 --> 01:51:32.400 align:start position:0%
kind it is in ours
 
01:51:33.590 --> 01:51:33.600 align:start position:0%
um I
 
01:51:37.430 --> 01:51:37.440 align:start position:0%
uh it's never been construed and I it's
 
01:51:39.709 --> 01:51:39.719 align:start position:0%
uh it's uh at least as far as I can
 
01:51:42.950 --> 01:51:42.960 align:start position:0%
recall and it's uh it's hard to
 
01:51:46.129 --> 01:51:46.139 align:start position:0%
understand Howard how it ever would be
 
01:51:49.189 --> 01:51:49.199 align:start position:0%
construed to allow you know a group to
 
01:51:51.169 --> 01:51:51.179 align:start position:0%
say we're marching on
 
01:51:53.030 --> 01:51:53.040 align:start position:0%
we're grabbing our guns and we're
 
01:51:54.890 --> 01:51:54.900 align:start position:0%
marching on the state house this
 
01:51:57.470 --> 01:51:57.480 align:start position:0%
afternoon uh I would think that the
 
01:51:59.570 --> 01:51:59.580 align:start position:0%
government would have a the you know
 
01:52:01.910 --> 01:52:01.920 align:start position:0%
that the constitution is not a suicide
 
01:52:04.010 --> 01:52:04.020 align:start position:0%
pact I guess I would say so I would
 
01:52:05.629 --> 01:52:05.639 align:start position:0%
think that that
 
01:52:07.310 --> 01:52:07.320 align:start position:0%
um and if then and I guess what I would
 
01:52:09.290 --> 01:52:09.300 align:start position:0%
the other thing I would say is if the if
 
01:52:11.810 --> 01:52:11.820 align:start position:0%
that provision applies it applies in so
 
01:52:14.450 --> 01:52:14.460 align:start position:0%
many you know it could be used to apply
 
01:52:17.870 --> 01:52:17.880 align:start position:0%
in so many circumstances to so many laws
 
01:52:20.750 --> 01:52:20.760 align:start position:0%
uh you know I'm
 
01:52:23.270 --> 01:52:23.280 align:start position:0%
I don't know that motor vehicle laws
 
01:52:25.970 --> 01:52:25.980 align:start position:0%
we're you know we we we're we we want to
 
01:52:28.189 --> 01:52:28.199 align:start position:0%
be able to speed because we're we're
 
01:52:30.530 --> 01:52:30.540 align:start position:0%
we're exercising our right of Revolution
 
01:52:32.149 --> 01:52:32.159 align:start position:0%
and we have to get to the state house
 
01:52:35.149 --> 01:52:35.159 align:start position:0%
right away to to uh to overthrow the
 
01:52:35.159 --> 01:52:36.229 align:start position:0%
right away to to uh to overthrow the
government

01:52:36.229 --> 01:52:36.239 align:start position:0%
government
 
01:52:37.970 --> 01:52:37.980 align:start position:0%
um but but you know I think there I
 
01:52:39.590 --> 01:52:39.600 align:start position:0%
guess the other point that that to to
 
01:52:41.450 --> 01:52:41.460 align:start position:0%
the extent you talk about you know that
 
01:52:44.450 --> 01:52:44.460 align:start position:0%
you use the the Nazi example
 
01:52:47.209 --> 01:52:47.219 align:start position:0%
um I guess what I would would remind
 
01:52:50.149 --> 01:52:50.159 align:start position:0%
everybody is you know there is
 
01:52:53.990 --> 01:52:54.000 align:start position:0%
remember Skokie Illinois uh in the late
 
01:52:57.950 --> 01:52:57.960 align:start position:0%
1970s when the Nazi party wanted to
 
01:53:01.310 --> 01:53:01.320 align:start position:0%
March uh in a uh through a neighborhood
 
01:53:04.310 --> 01:53:04.320 align:start position:0%
heavily Jewish neighborhood and it went
 
01:53:05.870 --> 01:53:05.880 align:start position:0%
to the Supreme Court and they said yes
 
01:53:08.990 --> 01:53:09.000 align:start position:0%
so you know however
 
01:53:12.470 --> 01:53:12.480 align:start position:0%
however distasteful and I in fact I
 
01:53:14.209 --> 01:53:14.219 align:start position:0%
think that's really kind of I think in
 
01:53:16.669 --> 01:53:16.679 align:start position:0%
some sense that's part of the problem is
 
01:53:16.679 --> 01:53:19.910 align:start position:0%
some sense that's part of the problem is
that

01:53:19.910 --> 01:53:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:23.870 --> 01:53:23.880 align:start position:0%
we've begun to restrict
 
01:53:26.510 --> 01:53:26.520 align:start position:0%
the First Amendment the the exercise of
 
01:53:29.750 --> 01:53:29.760 align:start position:0%
people's rights on the grounds of you
 
01:53:31.729 --> 01:53:31.739 align:start position:0%
know I the I mean I think some people
 
01:53:34.790 --> 01:53:34.800 align:start position:0%
today my sense is that
 
01:53:37.310 --> 01:53:37.320 align:start position:0%
most people when Skokie was decided and
 
01:53:39.590 --> 01:53:39.600 align:start position:0%
I think it was 1977 said you know as
 
01:53:42.050 --> 01:53:42.060 align:start position:0%
much as we as much as we hate what the
 
01:53:44.930 --> 01:53:44.940 align:start position:0%
Nazis are standing for we agree that
 
01:53:46.609 --> 01:53:46.619 align:start position:0%
they have the right to do this to March
 
01:53:49.510 --> 01:53:49.520 align:start position:0%
through Skokie Illinois and I'm
 
01:53:54.830 --> 01:53:54.840 align:start position:0%
concerned that we've begun to narrow our
 
01:53:56.830 --> 01:53:56.840 align:start position:0%
our conception of what is
 
01:53:59.570 --> 01:53:59.580 align:start position:0%
constitutionally allowed and I think
 
01:54:02.030 --> 01:54:02.040 align:start position:0%
that's that really is a problem because
 
01:54:03.770 --> 01:54:03.780 align:start position:0%
it becomes
 
01:54:05.390 --> 01:54:05.400 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:54:05.400 --> 01:54:09.590 align:start position:0%
you know
uh

01:54:09.590 --> 01:54:09.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:09.600 --> 01:54:11.450 align:start position:0%
 
speech

01:54:11.450 --> 01:54:11.460 align:start position:0%
speech
 
01:54:15.470 --> 01:54:15.480 align:start position:0%
I don't in any sense uh condone what
 
01:54:19.010 --> 01:54:19.020 align:start position:0%
happened on January 6 but for for the
 
01:54:20.270 --> 01:54:20.280 align:start position:0%
idea that
 
01:54:22.910 --> 01:54:22.920 align:start position:0%
um that the president couldn't you know
 
01:54:26.090 --> 01:54:26.100 align:start position:0%
if that the president couldn't go
 
01:54:28.189 --> 01:54:28.199 align:start position:0%
to let's say let's just let's suppose
 
01:54:30.770 --> 01:54:30.780 align:start position:0%
that that he wanted to go and hold a uh
 
01:54:33.649 --> 01:54:33.659 align:start position:0%
hold a rally a couple of weeks later in
 
01:54:36.050 --> 01:54:36.060 align:start position:0%
in a in a municipality in New Hampshire
 
01:54:37.729 --> 01:54:37.739 align:start position:0%
that the municipality could say well
 
01:54:40.129 --> 01:54:40.139 align:start position:0%
look what you did on January 6th we
 
01:54:43.310 --> 01:54:43.320 align:start position:0%
can't you can't come here to have a to
 
01:54:44.750 --> 01:54:44.760 align:start position:0%
to speak
 
01:54:48.109 --> 01:54:48.119 align:start position:0%
to peacefully speak about whatever that
 
01:54:50.450 --> 01:54:50.460 align:start position:0%
that kind of concerns me
 
01:54:52.370 --> 01:54:52.380 align:start position:0%
so I misspoke I shouldn't have said
 
01:54:54.169 --> 01:54:54.179 align:start position:0%
Nazis because I understand that I'm not
 
01:54:55.729 --> 01:54:55.739 align:start position:0%
talking about just not liking speech but
 
01:54:57.350 --> 01:54:57.360 align:start position:0%
I'm talking about misinformation and
 
01:54:58.609 --> 01:54:58.619 align:start position:0%
stuff that's not right like the
 
01:55:00.290 --> 01:55:00.300 align:start position:0%
Holocaust deniers or other things like
 
01:55:02.450 --> 01:55:02.460 align:start position:0%
that but I'm just clarifying I'm not
 
01:55:04.310 --> 01:55:04.320 align:start position:0%
going to argue about it but so you're
 
01:55:06.590 --> 01:55:06.600 align:start position:0%
saying that this bill
 
01:55:08.450 --> 01:55:08.460 align:start position:0%
um you're discounting the right to
 
01:55:10.970 --> 01:55:10.980 align:start position:0%
Revolution which which I mean we're
 
01:55:12.770 --> 01:55:12.780 align:start position:0%
talking about Free Speech it's not Motor
 
01:55:14.470 --> 01:55:14.480 align:start position:0%
Vehicles here we're um and
 
01:55:14.480 --> 01:55:16.010 align:start position:0%
Vehicles here we're um and
municipalities

01:55:16.010 --> 01:55:16.020 align:start position:0%
municipalities
 
01:55:16.020 --> 01:55:17.270 align:start position:0%
municipalities
um

01:55:17.270 --> 01:55:17.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:55:19.550 --> 01:55:19.560 align:start position:0%
you're saying any speech whether it's
 
01:55:22.129 --> 01:55:22.139 align:start position:0%
misinformation right or wrong it has to
 
01:55:24.790 --> 01:55:24.800 align:start position:0%
be not just distasteful but
 
01:55:26.750 --> 01:55:26.760 align:start position:0%
municipalities would have to allow it
 
01:55:28.850 --> 01:55:28.860 align:start position:0%
they could not regulate
 
01:55:30.169 --> 01:55:30.179 align:start position:0%
um the content of it and we've been
 
01:55:33.050 --> 01:55:33.060 align:start position:0%
regulating the First Amendment for
 
01:55:34.790 --> 01:55:34.800 align:start position:0%
hundreds of years I mean you know you
 
01:55:36.890 --> 01:55:36.900 align:start position:0%
can't yell fire in a crowded theater and
 
01:55:38.270 --> 01:55:38.280 align:start position:0%
a lot of other things like that but but
 
01:55:39.890 --> 01:55:39.900 align:start position:0%
I just want to be clear with you you're
 
01:55:41.510 --> 01:55:41.520 align:start position:0%
supporting this and you're agreeing that
 
01:55:44.149 --> 01:55:44.159 align:start position:0%
no content can be whether it's wrong or
 
01:55:46.189 --> 01:55:46.199 align:start position:0%
right or distasteful well no no I'm not
 
01:55:48.410 --> 01:55:48.420 align:start position:0%
saying that I'm saying reasonable time
 
01:55:50.750 --> 01:55:50.760 align:start position:0%
place and manner restrictions it seems
 
01:55:52.790 --> 01:55:52.800 align:start position:0%
to me that that
 
01:55:55.609 --> 01:55:55.619 align:start position:0%
um the uh and lawful purpose it seems to
 
01:55:58.430 --> 01:55:58.440 align:start position:0%
me that that if you're you know if you
 
01:56:00.050 --> 01:56:00.060 align:start position:0%
are saying
 
01:56:02.290 --> 01:56:02.300 align:start position:0%
um if you are if what you propose to do
 
01:56:05.450 --> 01:56:05.460 align:start position:0%
is to the equivalent of of have of
 
01:56:08.390 --> 01:56:08.400 align:start position:0%
yelling fire in a crowded theater
 
01:56:11.689 --> 01:56:11.699 align:start position:0%
um or pornography or you know that kind
 
01:56:13.850 --> 01:56:13.860 align:start position:0%
of thing the traditional things that
 
01:56:17.450 --> 01:56:17.460 align:start position:0%
have been held not to constitute a
 
01:56:20.930 --> 01:56:20.940 align:start position:0%
lawful uh lawful speech that can be
 
01:56:20.940 --> 01:56:22.129 align:start position:0%
lawful uh lawful speech that can be
regulated

01:56:22.129 --> 01:56:22.139 align:start position:0%
regulated
 
01:56:25.370 --> 01:56:25.380 align:start position:0%
um but if it's just you know if it's if
 
01:56:28.250 --> 01:56:28.260 align:start position:0%
it's if it's very distasteful and I
 
01:56:29.689 --> 01:56:29.699 align:start position:0%
think that's
 
01:56:31.310 --> 01:56:31.320 align:start position:0%
my sense is
 
01:56:34.010 --> 01:56:34.020 align:start position:0%
one of the reasons that that sort of
 
01:56:36.229 --> 01:56:36.239 align:start position:0%
animates these kind of these this this
 
01:56:41.350 --> 01:56:41.360 align:start position:0%
legislation is that there has been that
 
01:56:45.770 --> 01:56:45.780 align:start position:0%
view that we you know in other words is
 
01:56:47.990 --> 01:56:48.000 align:start position:0%
the the Nazis that wanted to March
 
01:56:50.510 --> 01:56:50.520 align:start position:0%
through Skokie would that today be
 
01:56:52.790 --> 01:56:52.800 align:start position:0%
called hate speech they what they wanted
 
01:56:55.070 --> 01:56:55.080 align:start position:0%
to do was hate speech and therefore it
 
01:56:58.430 --> 01:56:58.440 align:start position:0%
could be regulated I again as much as I
 
01:57:00.830 --> 01:57:00.840 align:start position:0%
would hate what they say I would tend to
 
01:57:03.709 --> 01:57:03.719 align:start position:0%
say no that's not you know that's not
 
01:57:07.250 --> 01:57:07.260 align:start position:0%
hate speech well if it is hate speech it
 
01:57:10.550 --> 01:57:10.560 align:start position:0%
cannot be uh prohibited and I think that
 
01:57:12.530 --> 01:57:12.540 align:start position:0%
that the concern I have is that there's
 
01:57:15.530 --> 01:57:15.540 align:start position:0%
there's this narrowing of what is the
 
01:57:17.930 --> 01:57:17.940 align:start position:0%
permissible range of speech and that
 
01:57:22.669 --> 01:57:22.679 align:start position:0%
troubles me a lot representative Staples
 
01:57:26.030 --> 01:57:26.040 align:start position:0%
I uh circled on your and circled on your
 
01:57:28.550 --> 01:57:28.560 align:start position:0%
Amendment lawful purpose
 
01:57:31.430 --> 01:57:31.440 align:start position:0%
and you linked lawful purpose and
 
01:57:35.390 --> 01:57:35.400 align:start position:0%
followed by subject matter addressed
 
01:57:38.870 --> 01:57:38.880 align:start position:0%
the subject matter
 
01:57:41.089 --> 01:57:41.099 align:start position:0%
um even if offensive is a First
 
01:57:41.099 --> 01:57:42.709 align:start position:0%
um even if offensive is a First
Amendment

01:57:42.709 --> 01:57:42.719 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
01:57:45.589 --> 01:57:45.599 align:start position:0%
now lawful purpose
 
01:57:49.310 --> 01:57:49.320 align:start position:0%
goes to what's the purpose of the uh Act
 
01:57:52.490 --> 01:57:52.500 align:start position:0%
of of the Gathering or activity is it to
 
01:57:54.649 --> 01:57:54.659 align:start position:0%
threaten and intimidate
 
01:57:57.169 --> 01:57:57.179 align:start position:0%
I mean go back to Skokie
 
01:57:59.870 --> 01:57:59.880 align:start position:0%
um they were probably protecting the
 
01:58:02.629 --> 01:58:02.639 align:start position:0%
First Amendment as distasteful as that
 
01:58:05.390 --> 01:58:05.400 align:start position:0%
was but but I would bet that there was
 
01:58:10.570 --> 01:58:10.580 align:start position:0%
some overabundance of legal uh police
 
01:58:12.950 --> 01:58:12.960 align:start position:0%
activity to make sure that they
 
01:58:12.960 --> 01:58:14.089 align:start position:0%
activity to make sure that they
mitigated

01:58:14.089 --> 01:58:14.099 align:start position:0%
mitigated
 
01:58:16.970 --> 01:58:16.980 align:start position:0%
threaten and intimidate nature of that
 
01:58:18.649 --> 01:58:18.659 align:start position:0%
particular March
 
01:58:21.589 --> 01:58:21.599 align:start position:0%
so I believe this Supreme Court
 
01:58:24.950 --> 01:58:24.960 align:start position:0%
recognized that that was contributory to
 
01:58:27.350 --> 01:58:27.360 align:start position:0%
holding down the threaten and intimidate
 
01:58:29.750 --> 01:58:29.760 align:start position:0%
aspect of it and that's part of the
 
01:58:32.750 --> 01:58:32.760 align:start position:0%
reason why they ruled us the way they
 
01:58:32.760 --> 01:58:34.010 align:start position:0%
reason why they ruled us the way they
did

01:58:34.010 --> 01:58:34.020 align:start position:0%
did
 
01:58:36.589 --> 01:58:36.599 align:start position:0%
representative tur
 
01:58:38.629 --> 01:58:38.639 align:start position:0%
yeah one of the things that stood out in
 
01:58:41.510 --> 01:58:41.520 align:start position:0%
the testimony on this bill from uh
 
01:58:43.970 --> 01:58:43.980 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire you know is
 
01:58:47.810 --> 01:58:47.820 align:start position:0%
basically he framed it in uh that he
 
01:58:50.390 --> 01:58:50.400 align:start position:0%
could have sued the town he thinks over
 
01:58:54.050 --> 01:58:54.060 align:start position:0%
you know their decision directly that he
 
01:58:56.149 --> 01:58:56.159 align:start position:0%
felt that it was inconvenient you know
 
01:58:58.370 --> 01:58:58.380 align:start position:0%
and that that going to the legislature
 
01:59:00.649 --> 01:59:00.659 align:start position:0%
was the better way to go I I also asked
 
01:59:00.659 --> 01:59:01.310 align:start position:0%
was the better way to go I I also asked
him

01:59:01.310 --> 01:59:01.320 align:start position:0%
him
 
01:59:02.990 --> 01:59:03.000 align:start position:0%
if he thinks he would have prevailed if
 
01:59:05.870 --> 01:59:05.880 align:start position:0%
he sued the town he thinks he would have
 
01:59:08.810 --> 01:59:08.820 align:start position:0%
um and I think that may go to this
 
01:59:11.649 --> 01:59:11.659 align:start position:0%
question of is this already basically
 
01:59:14.209 --> 01:59:14.219 align:start position:0%
you know guaranteed based on everything
 
01:59:15.709 --> 01:59:15.719 align:start position:0%
we've talked about that this really
 
01:59:19.010 --> 01:59:19.020 align:start position:0%
isn't isn't a needed law it just sort of
 
01:59:22.129 --> 01:59:22.139 align:start position:0%
you know based on a particular situation
 
01:59:24.530 --> 01:59:24.540 align:start position:0%
that arose you know
 
01:59:26.390 --> 01:59:26.400 align:start position:0%
that we don't know whether the courts
 
01:59:29.089 --> 01:59:29.099 align:start position:0%
would have upheld or not the town's
 
01:59:29.099 --> 01:59:30.589 align:start position:0%
would have upheld or not the town's
decision

01:59:30.589 --> 01:59:30.599 align:start position:0%
decision
 
01:59:32.270 --> 01:59:32.280 align:start position:0%
um it just sort of short-stopped it and
 
01:59:34.189 --> 01:59:34.199 align:start position:0%
went right to sort of creating new law
 
01:59:36.169 --> 01:59:36.179 align:start position:0%
and that worries me
 
01:59:38.510 --> 01:59:38.520 align:start position:0%
representative Alexander I think you
 
01:59:40.669 --> 01:59:40.679 align:start position:0%
I I did I just wanted to contribute a
 
01:59:42.050 --> 01:59:42.060 align:start position:0%
little bit I think like we're talking
 
01:59:43.790 --> 01:59:43.800 align:start position:0%
about time place and Manner and I think
 
01:59:45.890 --> 01:59:45.900 align:start position:0%
we're confusing that with like content
 
01:59:48.589 --> 01:59:48.599 align:start position:0%
so like we have a right to regulate time
 
01:59:49.910 --> 01:59:49.920 align:start position:0%
place and manner under the Constitution
 
01:59:52.070 --> 01:59:52.080 align:start position:0%
I think it's already granted right but
 
01:59:53.689 --> 01:59:53.699 align:start position:0%
um we don't have a right to regulate
 
01:59:55.850 --> 01:59:55.860 align:start position:0%
content right and I don't think that we
 
01:59:58.010 --> 01:59:58.020 align:start position:0%
should be able to regulate the content
 
02:00:00.050 --> 02:00:00.060 align:start position:0%
um just make it safe for everybody to
 
02:00:02.870 --> 02:00:02.880 align:start position:0%
Pro to speak and say what they like even
 
02:00:04.850 --> 02:00:04.860 align:start position:0%
though it may be wrong or disinformation
 
02:00:07.070 --> 02:00:07.080 align:start position:0%
to somebody else like you know you get
 
02:00:08.810 --> 02:00:08.820 align:start position:0%
10 flat earthers in the room like you
 
02:00:10.070 --> 02:00:10.080 align:start position:0%
shouldn't restrict them from be able to
 
02:00:12.830 --> 02:00:12.840 align:start position:0%
talk about the Earth being flat you know
 
02:00:15.290 --> 02:00:15.300 align:start position:0%
yes representative greeson thank you Mr
 
02:00:18.770 --> 02:00:18.780 align:start position:0%
chair is the expression or some similar
 
02:00:21.890 --> 02:00:21.900 align:start position:0%
expression lawful purpose anywhere else
 
02:00:24.709 --> 02:00:24.719 align:start position:0%
in rsas that would this be something
 
02:00:26.810 --> 02:00:26.820 align:start position:0%
that attorneys and judges would
 
02:00:28.550 --> 02:00:28.560 align:start position:0%
understand the meaning of the phrase
 
02:00:30.290 --> 02:00:30.300 align:start position:0%
lawful purpose
 
02:00:32.570 --> 02:00:32.580 align:start position:0%
I think so I think I mean I can't I
 
02:00:34.669 --> 02:00:34.679 align:start position:0%
can't tell you you know recite off the
 
02:00:36.350 --> 02:00:36.360 align:start position:0%
top of my head other you know other
 
02:00:39.169 --> 02:00:39.179 align:start position:0%
places but I but I I believe that you
 
02:00:41.750 --> 02:00:41.760 align:start position:0%
know that language or language like that
 
02:00:45.050 --> 02:00:45.060 align:start position:0%
as is used in a variety of contexts in
 
02:00:47.810 --> 02:00:47.820 align:start position:0%
the law uh representative Manos
 
02:00:50.450 --> 02:00:50.460 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I
 
02:00:50.460 --> 02:00:51.169 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I
um

02:00:51.169 --> 02:00:51.179 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:00:53.570 --> 02:00:53.580 align:start position:0%
in my recollection of Representative
 
02:00:56.149 --> 02:00:56.159 align:start position:0%
McGuire's testimony he also said that
 
02:00:58.310 --> 02:00:58.320 align:start position:0%
there was one facility that they were
 
02:01:00.709 --> 02:01:00.719 align:start position:0%
authorized to use and there was another
 
02:01:03.290 --> 02:01:03.300 align:start position:0%
facility the Gazebo where the the band
 
02:01:05.390 --> 02:01:05.400 align:start position:0%
stand that they were prohibited from
 
02:01:07.550 --> 02:01:07.560 align:start position:0%
using so
 
02:01:10.370 --> 02:01:10.380 align:start position:0%
um I I question whether I also question
 
02:01:13.310 --> 02:01:13.320 align:start position:0%
whether this is necessary because he was
 
02:01:16.189 --> 02:01:16.199 align:start position:0%
not being or the Republican group that
 
02:01:17.990 --> 02:01:18.000 align:start position:0%
he was associated with was not being
 
02:01:21.770 --> 02:01:21.780 align:start position:0%
totally excluded or precluded from uh
 
02:01:23.810 --> 02:01:23.820 align:start position:0%
speaking in a public place but it was
 
02:01:25.970 --> 02:01:25.980 align:start position:0%
one specific location
 
02:01:28.790 --> 02:01:28.800 align:start position:0%
the other thing that concerns me is this
 
02:01:32.270 --> 02:01:32.280 align:start position:0%
does not exclude commercial speech and
 
02:01:36.109 --> 02:01:36.119 align:start position:0%
so a question of whether this would um
 
02:01:39.129 --> 02:01:39.139 align:start position:0%
mandate that a municipality for example
 
02:01:42.290 --> 02:01:42.300 align:start position:0%
allowed people to use a room at the
 
02:01:44.770 --> 02:01:44.780 align:start position:0%
library to sell their widgets
 
02:01:48.649 --> 02:01:48.659 align:start position:0%
and I would be concerned about that also
 
02:01:49.970 --> 02:01:49.980 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
02:01:54.350 --> 02:01:54.360 align:start position:0%
other yes thank you Mr chair when I was
 
02:01:57.169 --> 02:01:57.179 align:start position:0%
reading the amendment and I'm sorry as a
 
02:02:00.350 --> 02:02:00.360 align:start position:0%
sub I wasn't here for the hearing but
 
02:02:02.330 --> 02:02:02.340 align:start position:0%
um it says no municipality shall
 
02:02:04.550 --> 02:02:04.560 align:start position:0%
discriminate the use of Municipal
 
02:02:06.770 --> 02:02:06.780 align:start position:0%
facilities I see this as a local control
 
02:02:10.490 --> 02:02:10.500 align:start position:0%
issue that municipalities are elected by
 
02:02:12.350 --> 02:02:12.360 align:start position:0%
their friends their neighbors people in
 
02:02:13.850 --> 02:02:13.860 align:start position:0%
that Community who know what's the best
 
02:02:17.030 --> 02:02:17.040 align:start position:0%
interest of that community and I would
 
02:02:17.040 --> 02:02:17.810 align:start position:0%
interest of that community and I would
um

02:02:17.810 --> 02:02:17.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:02:20.629 --> 02:02:20.639 align:start position:0%
I think they they are the best judge not
 
02:02:23.209 --> 02:02:23.219 align:start position:0%
people at the state level for the proper
 
02:02:25.010 --> 02:02:25.020 align:start position:0%
and appropriate use of their facilities
 
02:02:28.010 --> 02:02:28.020 align:start position:0%
okay all right other other comments I
 
02:02:30.770 --> 02:02:30.780 align:start position:0%
guess what I would just say is is this I
 
02:02:33.470 --> 02:02:33.480 align:start position:0%
think that the I mean I think with
 
02:02:36.589 --> 02:02:36.599 align:start position:0%
regard to representative McGuire's uh
 
02:02:40.669 --> 02:02:40.679 align:start position:0%
testimony I I do agree that he but I
 
02:02:42.050 --> 02:02:42.060 align:start position:0%
that he said you know there might have
 
02:02:43.310 --> 02:02:43.320 align:start position:0%
been another place where I could have
 
02:02:46.250 --> 02:02:46.260 align:start position:0%
but I think the the concern was that
 
02:02:49.490 --> 02:02:49.500 align:start position:0%
there was a that some people were
 
02:02:52.189 --> 02:02:52.199 align:start position:0%
allowed to use the place that he wanted
 
02:02:55.790 --> 02:02:55.800 align:start position:0%
to use but he was and I this is my word
 
02:02:57.709 --> 02:02:57.719 align:start position:0%
not his but he was relegated to
 
02:02:59.629 --> 02:02:59.639 align:start position:0%
somewhere else and sort of felt like
 
02:03:03.229 --> 02:03:03.239 align:start position:0%
wait a minute why why do why can't some
 
02:03:06.109 --> 02:03:06.119 align:start position:0%
people use this but not me that's that
 
02:03:08.810 --> 02:03:08.820 align:start position:0%
and I think that's the that's the issue
 
02:03:11.270 --> 02:03:11.280 align:start position:0%
and in terms of you know on the leaving
 
02:03:13.430 --> 02:03:13.440 align:start position:0%
it to the local level well
 
02:03:15.050 --> 02:03:15.060 align:start position:0%
I think that's
 
02:03:17.030 --> 02:03:17.040 align:start position:0%
that's the that's part of the problem is
 
02:03:19.669 --> 02:03:19.679 align:start position:0%
we want it to be equal
 
02:03:22.490 --> 02:03:22.500 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chair well one
 
02:03:24.830 --> 02:03:24.840 align:start position:0%
situation that I've been aware of in my
 
02:03:26.990 --> 02:03:27.000 align:start position:0%
town of Merrimack in the past is there's
 
02:03:28.550 --> 02:03:28.560 align:start position:0%
been some groups that have been allowed
 
02:03:30.169 --> 02:03:30.179 align:start position:0%
to use it there are now forbidden
 
02:03:31.729 --> 02:03:31.739 align:start position:0%
because they trashed it or they didn't
 
02:03:34.550 --> 02:03:34.560 align:start position:0%
pay their fee and I was wondering would
 
02:03:35.930 --> 02:03:35.940 align:start position:0%
this still
 
02:03:38.629 --> 02:03:38.639 align:start position:0%
um with this amendment allow those
 
02:03:41.089 --> 02:03:41.099 align:start position:0%
groups to be that the municipality would
 
02:03:42.950 --> 02:03:42.960 align:start position:0%
be forced having to allow them to use
 
02:03:46.129 --> 02:03:46.139 align:start position:0%
the facilities even if they have past
 
02:03:49.189 --> 02:03:49.199 align:start position:0%
practice of misusing them I would say no
 
02:03:50.810 --> 02:03:50.820 align:start position:0%
I would say that would be a reason to
 
02:03:53.030 --> 02:03:53.040 align:start position:0%
say wait a minute you know you although
 
02:03:56.270 --> 02:03:56.280 align:start position:0%
you say you're using this for a lawful
 
02:03:58.850 --> 02:03:58.860 align:start position:0%
purpose your track record your track
 
02:04:00.770 --> 02:04:00.780 align:start position:0%
record is that you have you know you've
 
02:04:02.810 --> 02:04:02.820 align:start position:0%
trashed the last the last three times
 
02:04:04.550 --> 02:04:04.560 align:start position:0%
you were here or whatever you've trashed
 
02:04:05.810 --> 02:04:05.820 align:start position:0%
the facility
 
02:04:07.490 --> 02:04:07.500 align:start position:0%
um or you've trashed other facilities or
 
02:04:09.589 --> 02:04:09.599 align:start position:0%
whatever and that that's uh that's a
 
02:04:11.570 --> 02:04:11.580 align:start position:0%
reason for you not to be allowed to use
 
02:04:14.270 --> 02:04:14.280 align:start position:0%
it representative Smith thank you Mr
 
02:04:14.280 --> 02:04:15.589 align:start position:0%
it representative Smith thank you Mr
chair

02:04:15.589 --> 02:04:15.599 align:start position:0%
chair
 
02:04:20.330 --> 02:04:20.340 align:start position:0%
um I've always leery about uh
 
02:04:25.129 --> 02:04:25.139 align:start position:0%
the legislature passing a bill
 
02:04:29.649 --> 02:04:29.659 align:start position:0%
that has to do with solving one problem
 
02:04:33.050 --> 02:04:33.060 align:start position:0%
in one town
 
02:04:36.530 --> 02:04:36.540 align:start position:0%
um maybe that's small-minded of me and
 
02:04:39.250 --> 02:04:39.260 align:start position:0%
I'm willing to consider an alternative
 
02:04:44.330 --> 02:04:44.340 align:start position:0%
but I wonder if anyone is aware
 
02:04:47.209 --> 02:04:47.219 align:start position:0%
of any problem
 
02:04:50.089 --> 02:04:50.099 align:start position:0%
similar to what our distinguished
 
02:04:52.930 --> 02:04:52.940 align:start position:0%
colleague has experienced
 
02:04:58.430 --> 02:04:58.440 align:start position:0%
in other towns and when we asked him a
 
02:05:01.010 --> 02:05:01.020 align:start position:0%
little bit about this with that
 
02:05:03.649 --> 02:05:03.659 align:start position:0%
wonderful smile he has he said well I'm
 
02:05:07.430 --> 02:05:07.440 align:start position:0%
a legislator so I figured I'd just get a
 
02:05:09.589 --> 02:05:09.599 align:start position:0%
legislative solution instead of trying
 
02:05:12.050 --> 02:05:12.060 align:start position:0%
to find another solution it's like when
 
02:05:14.450 --> 02:05:14.460 align:start position:0%
you go to a surgeon you know the surgeon
 
02:05:19.129 --> 02:05:19.139 align:start position:0%
solution is surgery and I wonder if
 
02:05:22.850 --> 02:05:22.860 align:start position:0%
instead if in this one case that's been
 
02:05:25.609 --> 02:05:25.619 align:start position:0%
brought to us he had gone back and said
 
02:05:29.890 --> 02:05:29.900 align:start position:0%
you know let's revisit this or if he had
 
02:05:32.629 --> 02:05:32.639 align:start position:0%
chosen to go to go to court or do
 
02:05:33.910 --> 02:05:33.920 align:start position:0%
something else
 
02:05:36.649 --> 02:05:36.659 align:start position:0%
if the problem might have been resolved
 
02:05:39.530 --> 02:05:39.540 align:start position:0%
and if therefore we would be
 
02:05:39.540 --> 02:05:40.810 align:start position:0%
and if therefore we would be
um

02:05:40.810 --> 02:05:40.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:05:44.209 --> 02:05:44.219 align:start position:0%
creating state law where there was no
 
02:05:46.430 --> 02:05:46.440 align:start position:0%
need to do that
 
02:05:49.609 --> 02:05:49.619 align:start position:0%
yes representative kouta
 
02:05:52.129 --> 02:05:52.139 align:start position:0%
so I am aware of some other towns that
 
02:05:54.709 --> 02:05:54.719 align:start position:0%
have stopped for example the lgbtq
 
02:05:57.890 --> 02:05:57.900 align:start position:0%
community from holding events because
 
02:05:59.810 --> 02:05:59.820 align:start position:0%
they didn't want Pride festivals because
 
02:06:02.089 --> 02:06:02.099 align:start position:0%
they questioned the appropriateness of
 
02:06:06.169 --> 02:06:06.179 align:start position:0%
having drag queens in in the schools and
 
02:06:08.089 --> 02:06:08.099 align:start position:0%
I want to state that this would be like
 
02:06:10.370 --> 02:06:10.380 align:start position:0%
after school hours or in the summer I
 
02:06:12.649 --> 02:06:12.659 align:start position:0%
know my town did allow the event to go
 
02:06:14.030 --> 02:06:14.040 align:start position:0%
on but there have been several other
 
02:06:16.310 --> 02:06:16.320 align:start position:0%
towns that have rejected this so I do
 
02:06:18.649 --> 02:06:18.659 align:start position:0%
think there are other examples besides
 
02:06:21.589 --> 02:06:21.599 align:start position:0%
just the example that the sponsor had
 
02:06:24.410 --> 02:06:24.420 align:start position:0%
introduced because I have heard of the
 
02:06:26.570 --> 02:06:26.580 align:start position:0%
pride festival thing being denied in
 
02:06:29.330 --> 02:06:29.340 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:31.729 --> 02:06:31.739 align:start position:0%
oh yes representative trip
 
02:06:33.890 --> 02:06:33.900 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
02:06:37.689 --> 02:06:37.699 align:start position:0%
I agree with representative Smith
 
02:06:41.450 --> 02:06:41.460 align:start position:0%
during the uh the hearing I basically
 
02:06:43.330 --> 02:06:43.340 align:start position:0%
said the same thing that
 
02:06:46.609 --> 02:06:46.619 align:start position:0%
she mentioned now I I think this is a
 
02:06:50.030 --> 02:06:50.040 align:start position:0%
point solution to uh a problem in one
 
02:06:52.669 --> 02:06:52.679 align:start position:0%
town that is going to be applied
 
02:06:56.149 --> 02:06:56.159 align:start position:0%
Statewide now that often doesn't end
 
02:06:58.729 --> 02:06:58.739 align:start position:0%
well since uh most sounds aren't like
 
02:07:00.950 --> 02:07:00.960 align:start position:0%
the town that this person lives in and
 
02:07:03.770 --> 02:07:03.780 align:start position:0%
you know it just creates more problems
 
02:07:07.129 --> 02:07:07.139 align:start position:0%
so uh I'm I'm in favor of italing the
 
02:07:07.139 --> 02:07:08.510 align:start position:0%
so uh I'm I'm in favor of italing the
bill

02:07:08.510 --> 02:07:08.520 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:07:11.030 --> 02:07:11.040 align:start position:0%
uh representative uh manage did you have
 
02:07:12.530 --> 02:07:12.540 align:start position:0%
did you have your hand up does anybody
 
02:07:14.270 --> 02:07:14.280 align:start position:0%
else have anything else they want to say
 
02:07:16.970 --> 02:07:16.980 align:start position:0%
all right so are we ready for
 
02:07:18.950 --> 02:07:18.960 align:start position:0%
um this is on the amendment are we ready
 
02:07:18.960 --> 02:07:20.629 align:start position:0%
um this is on the amendment are we ready
for

02:07:20.629 --> 02:07:20.639 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:07:23.030 --> 02:07:23.040 align:start position:0%
um a vote on the amendment and I and my
 
02:07:24.589 --> 02:07:24.599 align:start position:0%
sense is we should not do this by Voice
 
02:07:26.930 --> 02:07:26.940 align:start position:0%
vote but by a show of hands
 
02:07:29.570 --> 02:07:29.580 align:start position:0%
um and then uh depending on what that is
 
02:07:34.970 --> 02:07:34.980 align:start position:0%
we'll go to the main the main uh motion
 
02:07:37.430 --> 02:07:37.440 align:start position:0%
because we have people in the room who
 
02:07:39.890 --> 02:07:39.900 align:start position:0%
have never experienced this would it be
 
02:07:42.530 --> 02:07:42.540 align:start position:0%
appropriate for me to point out that it
 
02:07:47.570 --> 02:07:47.580 align:start position:0%
is possible to vote for the amendment
 
02:07:51.950 --> 02:07:51.960 align:start position:0%
and then against the underlying motion
 
02:07:54.350 --> 02:07:54.360 align:start position:0%
so that you know you're it's not a
 
02:07:56.149 --> 02:07:56.159 align:start position:0%
question of Ingrid diamond for a dollar
 
02:07:58.250 --> 02:07:58.260 align:start position:0%
if you think that you don't really like
 
02:07:59.870 --> 02:07:59.880 align:start position:0%
the bill but the amendment would be
 
02:07:59.880 --> 02:08:00.890 align:start position:0%
the bill but the amendment would be
better

02:08:00.890 --> 02:08:00.900 align:start position:0%
better
 
02:08:02.990 --> 02:08:03.000 align:start position:0%
than not so I just want to make sure
 
02:08:04.850 --> 02:08:04.860 align:start position:0%
people know that sure no no that's and
 
02:08:06.109 --> 02:08:06.119 align:start position:0%
that's a very good point I'm glad you
 
02:08:09.470 --> 02:08:09.480 align:start position:0%
yes representative man it is it possible
 
02:08:12.229 --> 02:08:12.239 align:start position:0%
to make a verbal amendment to your
 
02:08:14.209 --> 02:08:14.219 align:start position:0%
Amendment no no
 
02:08:16.970 --> 02:08:16.980 align:start position:0%
and so we gotta we I you know in many
 
02:08:20.510 --> 02:08:20.520 align:start position:0%
ways many times both last two years and
 
02:08:22.129 --> 02:08:22.139 align:start position:0%
and this year I thought that would be a
 
02:08:24.530 --> 02:08:24.540 align:start position:0%
great idea but we really it has to be it
 
02:08:27.290 --> 02:08:27.300 align:start position:0%
is possible we don't have to the way you
 
02:08:36.050 --> 02:08:36.060 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:38.209 --> 02:08:38.219 align:start position:0%
so we don't need any other permission
 
02:08:41.270 --> 02:08:41.280 align:start position:0%
and if in fact you want to delay the
 
02:08:44.629 --> 02:08:44.639 align:start position:0%
vote and um and submit and prepare have
 
02:08:47.030 --> 02:08:47.040 align:start position:0%
another amendment prepared by OLS for us
 
02:08:49.430 --> 02:08:49.440 align:start position:0%
to vote on on Wednesday that would be
 
02:08:51.649 --> 02:08:51.659 align:start position:0%
possible so could I just ask you then in
 
02:08:53.169 --> 02:08:53.179 align:start position:0%
light of that
 
02:08:56.149 --> 02:08:56.159 align:start position:0%
comment by representative Smith uh could
 
02:08:58.010 --> 02:08:58.020 align:start position:0%
you tell US Representative Manos what
 
02:09:00.169 --> 02:09:00.179 align:start position:0%
you're what you're thinking your your
 
02:09:02.510 --> 02:09:02.520 align:start position:0%
motion would say I I don't know the
 
02:09:04.129 --> 02:09:04.139 align:start position:0%
amendment was saying yes I don't know
 
02:09:06.290 --> 02:09:06.300 align:start position:0%
the exact language but its intent at
 
02:09:07.790 --> 02:09:07.800 align:start position:0%
least would be to exclude commercial
 
02:09:11.030 --> 02:09:11.040 align:start position:0%
speech so that we don't have libraries
 
02:09:12.609 --> 02:09:12.619 align:start position:0%
forced into
 
02:09:15.950 --> 02:09:15.960 align:start position:0%
allowing people to sell widgets snake
 
02:09:18.290 --> 02:09:18.300 align:start position:0%
oil or Amway right right
 
02:09:18.300 --> 02:09:20.510 align:start position:0%
oil or Amway right right
um

02:09:20.510 --> 02:09:20.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:22.910 --> 02:09:22.920 align:start position:0%
uh okay
 
02:09:22.920 --> 02:09:23.770 align:start position:0%
uh okay
um

02:09:23.770 --> 02:09:23.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:09:27.169 --> 02:09:27.179 align:start position:0%
sure uh yes representative Stapleton
 
02:09:29.450 --> 02:09:29.460 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
02:09:32.870 --> 02:09:32.880 align:start position:0%
I'm having a pause even on the basis of
 
02:09:36.290 --> 02:09:36.300 align:start position:0%
the subject matter to be addressed
 
02:09:38.330 --> 02:09:38.340 align:start position:0%
um there's some awful stuff happening
 
02:09:40.010 --> 02:09:40.020 align:start position:0%
out there and probably will continue to
 
02:09:43.550 --> 02:09:43.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:46.209 --> 02:09:46.219 align:start position:0%
um does this prohibit
 
02:09:49.310 --> 02:09:49.320 align:start position:0%
the municipality from
 
02:09:52.089 --> 02:09:52.099 align:start position:0%
putting the brakes on a distasteful
 
02:09:52.099 --> 02:09:53.709 align:start position:0%
putting the brakes on a distasteful
obscene

02:09:53.709 --> 02:09:53.719 align:start position:0%
obscene
 
02:09:56.149 --> 02:09:56.159 align:start position:0%
extremely offensive
 
02:09:56.159 --> 02:09:58.550 align:start position:0%
extremely offensive
disturbing

02:09:58.550 --> 02:09:58.560 align:start position:0%
disturbing
 
02:10:00.609 --> 02:10:00.619 align:start position:0%
subject matter
 
02:10:03.470 --> 02:10:03.480 align:start position:0%
displays and so forth in the public
 
02:10:03.480 --> 02:10:04.970 align:start position:0%
displays and so forth in the public
event

02:10:04.970 --> 02:10:04.980 align:start position:0%
event
 
02:10:08.209 --> 02:10:08.219 align:start position:0%
that's it so I as I
 
02:10:10.189 --> 02:10:10.199 align:start position:0%
this is my view of this as I said before
 
02:10:12.169 --> 02:10:12.179 align:start position:0%
I think if it's obscene
 
02:10:15.970 --> 02:10:15.980 align:start position:0%
or it's you know a uh a
 
02:10:18.530 --> 02:10:18.540 align:start position:0%
call to imminent violence or something
 
02:10:21.169 --> 02:10:21.179 align:start position:0%
like that I think clearly that would be
 
02:10:23.450 --> 02:10:23.460 align:start position:0%
unlawful under I think under existing
 
02:10:26.209 --> 02:10:26.219 align:start position:0%
law the when you say extremely
 
02:10:26.219 --> 02:10:27.830 align:start position:0%
law the when you say extremely
distasteful

02:10:27.830 --> 02:10:27.840 align:start position:0%
distasteful
 
02:10:30.050 --> 02:10:30.060 align:start position:0%
that's you know that's the thing that
 
02:10:31.729 --> 02:10:31.739 align:start position:0%
sort of troubles me because I think that
 
02:10:35.270 --> 02:10:35.280 align:start position:0%
gets to the the Skokie example is it you
 
02:10:37.250 --> 02:10:37.260 align:start position:0%
know I think probably all of us would
 
02:10:41.030 --> 02:10:41.040 align:start position:0%
say that uh the Nazis marching through
 
02:10:43.250 --> 02:10:43.260 align:start position:0%
Skokie was extremely distasteful I would
 
02:10:47.149 --> 02:10:47.159 align:start position:0%
certainly say that um but I tend to say
 
02:10:49.129 --> 02:10:49.139 align:start position:0%
you know that they have the right to do
 
02:10:51.290 --> 02:10:51.300 align:start position:0%
that and my concern and I think really
 
02:10:52.729 --> 02:10:52.739 align:start position:0%
this is
 
02:10:54.470 --> 02:10:54.480 align:start position:0%
I think this is really representative
 
02:10:57.470 --> 02:10:57.480 align:start position:0%
McGuire's concern that emanate then from
 
02:11:00.550 --> 02:11:00.560 align:start position:0%
which this emanates is that
 
02:11:04.729 --> 02:11:04.739 align:start position:0%
it there seems to be a sense in many I
 
02:11:07.310 --> 02:11:07.320 align:start position:0%
think many officials at both the local
 
02:11:08.870 --> 02:11:08.880 align:start position:0%
level and the state level and maybe even
 
02:11:10.850 --> 02:11:10.860 align:start position:0%
at the national level that
 
02:11:12.649 --> 02:11:12.659 align:start position:0%
you know we can
 
02:11:15.589 --> 02:11:15.599 align:start position:0%
we can say that certain speeches just
 
02:11:17.810 --> 02:11:17.820 align:start position:0%
off limits and you don't the the public
 
02:11:20.450 --> 02:11:20.460 align:start position:0%
doesn't have to listen to it and
 
02:11:21.770 --> 02:11:21.780 align:start position:0%
um even
 
02:11:24.109 --> 02:11:24.119 align:start position:0%
you know even the Nazis in Skokie as
 
02:11:25.790 --> 02:11:25.800 align:start position:0%
much as I find that really really
 
02:11:28.430 --> 02:11:28.440 align:start position:0%
distasteful I think that
 
02:11:30.830 --> 02:11:30.840 align:start position:0%
our first amendment is designed to
 
02:11:32.689 --> 02:11:32.699 align:start position:0%
protect that kind of that kind of thing
 
02:11:35.990 --> 02:11:36.000 align:start position:0%
and that's I think that's the basis of
 
02:11:36.000 --> 02:11:36.830 align:start position:0%
and that's I think that's the basis of
the

02:11:36.830 --> 02:11:36.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:11:39.589 --> 02:11:39.599 align:start position:0%
of the bill yes representative Greece uh
 
02:11:40.910 --> 02:11:40.920 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and I think the
 
02:11:43.250 --> 02:11:43.260 align:start position:0%
amendment that uh may be suggested by
 
02:11:44.990 --> 02:11:45.000 align:start position:0%
representative Manos would be to insert
 
02:11:46.850 --> 02:11:46.860 align:start position:0%
the word non-commercial between the
 
02:11:53.890 --> 02:11:53.900 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:58.010 --> 02:11:58.020 align:start position:0%
I I mean yeah that may well be uh I
 
02:12:00.589 --> 02:12:00.599 align:start position:0%
would count on OLS to provide me with
 
02:12:02.209 --> 02:12:02.219 align:start position:0%
the line so you know what can I just uh
 
02:12:05.930 --> 02:12:05.940 align:start position:0%
in the interest of sort of uh of
 
02:12:07.790 --> 02:12:07.800 align:start position:0%
lack of a better term not wasting
 
02:12:09.770 --> 02:12:09.780 align:start position:0%
everybody's time could I just could I
 
02:12:12.830 --> 02:12:12.840 align:start position:0%
just kind of get a general sense of is
 
02:12:15.530 --> 02:12:15.540 align:start position:0%
that is that something that would make a
 
02:12:15.540 --> 02:12:16.550 align:start position:0%
that is that something that would make a
difference

02:12:16.550 --> 02:12:16.560 align:start position:0%
difference
 
02:12:19.550 --> 02:12:19.560 align:start position:0%
in the final vote of of you know of
 
02:12:21.050 --> 02:12:21.060 align:start position:0%
people who have expressed concern about
 
02:12:23.030 --> 02:12:23.040 align:start position:0%
the about the legislation because if it
 
02:12:25.189 --> 02:12:25.199 align:start position:0%
wouldn't then it you know it's it's sort
 
02:12:26.689 --> 02:12:26.699 align:start position:0%
of a waste of your it's a waste of your
 
02:12:29.570 --> 02:12:29.580 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:32.510 --> 02:12:32.520 align:start position:0%
that's a fair question
 
02:12:35.209 --> 02:12:35.219 align:start position:0%
so do you want to are you asking to vote
 
02:12:37.010 --> 02:12:37.020 align:start position:0%
no no I'm not no I'm just sort of I'm
 
02:12:40.089 --> 02:12:40.099 align:start position:0%
just trying to try to get us yeah
 
02:12:42.470 --> 02:12:42.480 align:start position:0%
that's the proposed amendment has
 
02:12:44.629 --> 02:12:44.639 align:start position:0%
suggested by representative Manos
 
02:12:47.390 --> 02:12:47.400 align:start position:0%
how would you vote by Sean Penns at this
 
02:12:51.129 --> 02:12:51.139 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:53.510 --> 02:12:53.520 align:start position:0%
in other words if you right on the if
 
02:12:55.370 --> 02:12:55.380 align:start position:0%
let's suppose that that representative
 
02:12:56.930 --> 02:12:56.940 align:start position:0%
manner that we had before US
 
02:13:00.589 --> 02:13:00.599 align:start position:0%
Representative Manos amendment that that
 
02:13:03.169 --> 02:13:03.179 align:start position:0%
said as representative greeson uh
 
02:13:04.850 --> 02:13:04.860 align:start position:0%
suggested that
 
02:13:07.970 --> 02:13:07.980 align:start position:0%
um so that it the the language of the of
 
02:13:10.189 --> 02:13:10.199 align:start position:0%
the amendment was no municipality shall
 
02:13:11.870 --> 02:13:11.880 align:start position:0%
discriminate against any individual or
 
02:13:14.450 --> 02:13:14.460 align:start position:0%
group in the use of Municipal Municipal
 
02:13:18.589 --> 02:13:18.599 align:start position:0%
facilities for a lawful non-commercial
 
02:13:18.599 --> 02:13:19.970 align:start position:0%
facilities for a lawful non-commercial
purpose

02:13:19.970 --> 02:13:19.980 align:start position:0%
purpose
 
02:13:22.189 --> 02:13:22.199 align:start position:0%
so let's suppose that it said that but
 
02:13:24.649 --> 02:13:24.659 align:start position:0%
everything else in the amendment was the
 
02:13:24.659 --> 02:13:25.790 align:start position:0%
everything else in the amendment was the
same

02:13:25.790 --> 02:13:25.800 align:start position:0%
same
 
02:13:27.109 --> 02:13:27.119 align:start position:0%
um could we just sort of have a straw
 
02:13:29.450 --> 02:13:29.460 align:start position:0%
vote on what the on whether people would
 
02:13:31.790 --> 02:13:31.800 align:start position:0%
be in favor of the Bill of the amendment
 
02:13:33.950 --> 02:13:33.960 align:start position:0%
with that language added
 
02:13:35.450 --> 02:13:35.460 align:start position:0%
um so I can have if you would be in
 
02:13:37.310 --> 02:13:37.320 align:start position:0%
favor of it could you raise your hand if
 
02:13:39.649 --> 02:13:39.659 align:start position:0%
you would be opposed to it well so first
 
02:13:42.050 --> 02:13:42.060 align:start position:0%
of all people would be in favor of it
 
02:13:43.550 --> 02:13:43.560 align:start position:0%
with that language
 
02:13:46.129 --> 02:13:46.139 align:start position:0%
let's go
 
02:13:48.950 --> 02:13:48.960 align:start position:0%
all right so what are we earning three
 
02:13:52.729 --> 02:13:52.739 align:start position:0%
four five six seven eight nine ten
 
02:13:55.970 --> 02:13:55.980 align:start position:0%
eleven twelve okay and the people that
 
02:13:57.470 --> 02:13:57.480 align:start position:0%
would be opposed to it even if it
 
02:13:59.450 --> 02:13:59.460 align:start position:0%
contained that link
 
02:14:00.649 --> 02:14:00.659 align:start position:0%
no we're just talking about the
 
02:14:02.270 --> 02:14:02.280 align:start position:0%
amendment I mean right the amendment
 
02:14:03.410 --> 02:14:03.420 align:start position:0%
people that would be opposed to the
 
02:14:05.810 --> 02:14:05.820 align:start position:0%
amendment even if it contained that
 
02:14:05.820 --> 02:14:06.910 align:start position:0%
amendment even if it contained that
language

02:14:06.910 --> 02:14:06.920 align:start position:0%
language
 
02:14:10.010 --> 02:14:10.020 align:start position:0%
even if it contained non-commercial
 
02:14:12.770 --> 02:14:12.780 align:start position:0%
one two okay all right
 
02:14:12.780 --> 02:14:14.750 align:start position:0%
one two okay all right
um

02:14:14.750 --> 02:14:14.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:14:17.810 --> 02:14:17.820 align:start position:0%
okay well since it wouldn't be an
 
02:14:19.729 --> 02:14:19.739 align:start position:0%
exercise it wouldn't be an exercise in
 
02:14:21.950 --> 02:14:21.960 align:start position:0%
futility no then your next question is
 
02:14:24.850 --> 02:14:24.860 align:start position:0%
that you have to think about is
 
02:14:28.189 --> 02:14:28.199 align:start position:0%
if that Amendment were to pass right
 
02:14:29.810 --> 02:14:29.820 align:start position:0%
would you
 
02:14:32.810 --> 02:14:32.820 align:start position:0%
vote for the underlying bill right right
 
02:14:34.430 --> 02:14:34.440 align:start position:0%
now that's a good question so maybe we
 
02:14:36.530 --> 02:14:36.540 align:start position:0%
should have a strong vote on that so
 
02:14:38.689 --> 02:14:38.699 align:start position:0%
let's assume that that that we had the
 
02:14:40.970 --> 02:14:40.980 align:start position:0%
non-commercial language added that
 
02:14:42.950 --> 02:14:42.960 align:start position:0%
Amendment passed which it sounds like it
 
02:14:45.470 --> 02:14:45.480 align:start position:0%
might and now we're back now we're now
 
02:14:48.770 --> 02:14:48.780 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:51.350 --> 02:14:51.360 align:start position:0%
ought to pass the bill would would you
 
02:14:53.030 --> 02:14:53.040 align:start position:0%
vote to
 
02:14:55.189 --> 02:14:55.199 align:start position:0%
otpa the bill with the uh with the
 
02:14:57.729 --> 02:14:57.739 align:start position:0%
Amendments with the Manus Amendment
 
02:15:00.290 --> 02:15:00.300 align:start position:0%
uh Mr chair I would want to hear the
 
02:15:02.330 --> 02:15:02.340 align:start position:0%
discussion after the amendment is
 
02:15:03.950 --> 02:15:03.960 align:start position:0%
presented I would honestly want to hear
 
02:15:06.890 --> 02:15:06.900 align:start position:0%
the discussion before I can reached a
 
02:15:08.870 --> 02:15:08.880 align:start position:0%
conclusion on the underlying bill
 
02:15:11.149 --> 02:15:11.159 align:start position:0%
okay all right
 
02:15:13.790 --> 02:15:13.800 align:start position:0%
um so you know I'm still gonna I I guess
 
02:15:15.470 --> 02:15:15.480 align:start position:0%
I would still just ask for a strawberry
 
02:15:16.910 --> 02:15:16.920 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to bind anybody if you
 
02:15:18.350 --> 02:15:18.360 align:start position:0%
change your mind but I guess what I'm
 
02:15:20.569 --> 02:15:20.579 align:start position:0%
saying is you know if everybody would
 
02:15:21.709 --> 02:15:21.719 align:start position:0%
say that they're gonna they're gonna
 
02:15:24.350 --> 02:15:24.360 align:start position:0%
vote against it even with that then then
 
02:15:26.510 --> 02:15:26.520 align:start position:0%
I you know is there really any point in
 
02:15:29.330 --> 02:15:29.340 align:start position:0%
in having that Amendment so could I just
 
02:15:31.609 --> 02:15:31.619 align:start position:0%
ask if you would vote
 
02:15:33.530 --> 02:15:33.540 align:start position:0%
let's assume that the amendment was
 
02:15:38.149 --> 02:15:38.159 align:start position:0%
proposed with the with the accepting we
 
02:15:40.609 --> 02:15:40.619 align:start position:0%
removing uh commercial speech from the
 
02:15:40.619 --> 02:15:41.810 align:start position:0%
removing uh commercial speech from the
language

02:15:41.810 --> 02:15:41.820 align:start position:0%
language
 
02:15:44.390 --> 02:15:44.400 align:start position:0%
um and that Amendment passed and now the
 
02:15:46.910 --> 02:15:46.920 align:start position:0%
question was will you vote for the bill
 
02:15:49.609 --> 02:15:49.619 align:start position:0%
as amended with the non-commercial
 
02:15:51.950 --> 02:15:51.960 align:start position:0%
exception in there how many would vote
 
02:15:56.569 --> 02:15:56.579 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:00.350 --> 02:16:00.360 align:start position:0%
we have one two three four all right it
 
02:16:03.290 --> 02:16:03.300 align:start position:0%
appears that that bill will not uh that
 
02:16:05.990 --> 02:16:06.000 align:start position:0%
appears that we would not have uh
 
02:16:07.910 --> 02:16:07.920 align:start position:0%
sufficient votes so it I you know in the
 
02:16:09.830 --> 02:16:09.840 align:start position:0%
interest of not having you
 
02:16:12.050 --> 02:16:12.060 align:start position:0%
um which will Implement your emotion
 
02:16:16.810 --> 02:16:16.820 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:18.770 --> 02:16:18.780 align:start position:0%
amend them
 
02:16:21.470 --> 02:16:21.480 align:start position:0%
well you know what I guess uh
 
02:16:24.229 --> 02:16:24.239 align:start position:0%
I guess I'm I I really I mean I
 
02:16:26.030 --> 02:16:26.040 align:start position:0%
understand where this is going but I
 
02:16:28.129 --> 02:16:28.139 align:start position:0%
guess I'm gonna I'm I'm gonna
 
02:16:30.229 --> 02:16:30.239 align:start position:0%
stick with even though it may I may be
 
02:16:31.970 --> 02:16:31.980 align:start position:0%
on the losing side I'm gonna I'm gonna
 
02:16:34.610 --> 02:16:34.620 align:start position:0%
call for a vote on the amendment and
 
02:16:37.190 --> 02:16:37.200 align:start position:0%
that yes representative staple
 
02:16:37.200 --> 02:16:38.450 align:start position:0%
that yes representative staple
well

02:16:38.450 --> 02:16:38.460 align:start position:0%
well
 
02:16:40.849 --> 02:16:40.859 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna throw another one in here and
 
02:16:44.270 --> 02:16:44.280 align:start position:0%
I hate to do this but oh that's okay
 
02:16:46.509 --> 02:16:46.519 align:start position:0%
um I don't have a problem with the
 
02:16:49.250 --> 02:16:49.260 align:start position:0%
non-commercial aspect of the ad Edition
 
02:16:49.260 --> 02:16:50.270 align:start position:0%
non-commercial aspect of the ad Edition
but

02:16:50.270 --> 02:16:50.280 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:16:52.849 --> 02:16:52.859 align:start position:0%
I'm reading this over a lawful purpose
 
02:16:55.849 --> 02:16:55.859 align:start position:0%
on the basis of and I'm thinking should
 
02:16:59.089 --> 02:16:59.099 align:start position:0%
that be lawful purpose solely on the
 
02:17:01.070 --> 02:17:01.080 align:start position:0%
basis of the subject matter to be
 
02:17:02.209 --> 02:17:02.219 align:start position:0%
addressed there may be other
 
02:17:05.929 --> 02:17:05.939 align:start position:0%
considerations of safety numbers
 
02:17:08.629 --> 02:17:08.639 align:start position:0%
management resources
 
02:17:08.639 --> 02:17:09.889 align:start position:0%
management resources
um

02:17:09.889 --> 02:17:09.899 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:17:12.290 --> 02:17:12.300 align:start position:0%
conditions of the venue
 
02:17:15.169 --> 02:17:15.179 align:start position:0%
and putting the words solely in there
 
02:17:19.610 --> 02:17:19.620 align:start position:0%
does give us a little bit of latitude so
 
02:17:22.129 --> 02:17:22.139 align:start position:0%
that it's not the most prominent aspect
 
02:17:25.549 --> 02:17:25.559 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:27.650 --> 02:17:27.660 align:start position:0%
all right
 
02:17:31.490 --> 02:17:31.500 align:start position:0%
um anybody else have any comments
 
02:17:33.469 --> 02:17:33.479 align:start position:0%
yes representative D Lorenzo thank you
 
02:17:34.549 --> 02:17:34.559 align:start position:0%
Mr chair
 
02:17:36.950 --> 02:17:36.960 align:start position:0%
um I didn't get a chance to weigh in but
 
02:17:40.009 --> 02:17:40.019 align:start position:0%
I am not opposed to
 
02:17:43.429 --> 02:17:43.439 align:start position:0%
um allowing public facilities
 
02:17:46.250 --> 02:17:46.260 align:start position:0%
to be used commercially
 
02:17:49.250 --> 02:17:49.260 align:start position:0%
and I feel that way because there are
 
02:17:52.070 --> 02:17:52.080 align:start position:0%
some towns that might have a a town hall
 
02:17:55.190 --> 02:17:55.200 align:start position:0%
or a town Auditorium that's
 
02:17:57.410 --> 02:17:57.420 align:start position:0%
um available for functions social
 
02:17:59.509 --> 02:17:59.519 align:start position:0%
functions like weddings or you know
 
02:18:01.490 --> 02:18:01.500 align:start position:0%
birthday parties or whatever and it's a
 
02:18:04.009 --> 02:18:04.019 align:start position:0%
chance for the town to make some money
 
02:18:06.410 --> 02:18:06.420 align:start position:0%
some extra income so
 
02:18:08.509 --> 02:18:08.519 align:start position:0%
I think we have to consider that well
 
02:18:10.910 --> 02:18:10.920 align:start position:0%
that's a valid point
 
02:18:10.920 --> 02:18:12.049 align:start position:0%
that's a valid point
um

02:18:12.049 --> 02:18:12.059 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:18:12.059 --> 02:18:13.549 align:start position:0%
um
so

02:18:13.549 --> 02:18:13.559 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:18:15.770 --> 02:18:15.780 align:start position:0%
I and I appreciate your your comments
 
02:18:18.290 --> 02:18:18.300 align:start position:0%
representative Stapleton um I have a
 
02:18:21.709 --> 02:18:21.719 align:start position:0%
sense that even with that even with that
 
02:18:25.669 --> 02:18:25.679 align:start position:0%
language that the there there that
 
02:18:28.549 --> 02:18:28.559 align:start position:0%
the the amendment would not pass and so
 
02:18:31.190 --> 02:18:31.200 align:start position:0%
rather than sort of you know
 
02:18:33.049 --> 02:18:33.059 align:start position:0%
having people go to the trouble of of
 
02:18:35.750 --> 02:18:35.760 align:start position:0%
for of proposing amendments and writing
 
02:18:39.049 --> 02:18:39.059 align:start position:0%
amendments that that uh would would just
 
02:18:42.049 --> 02:18:42.059 align:start position:0%
prolong things I guess I'm gonna
 
02:18:46.849 --> 02:18:46.859 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:49.610 --> 02:18:49.620 align:start position:0%
sure so if we added the if we added the
 
02:18:52.969 --> 02:18:52.979 align:start position:0%
solely length if if we added the solely
 
02:18:54.410 --> 02:18:54.420 align:start position:0%
language that representative Stapleton
 
02:18:57.230 --> 02:18:57.240 align:start position:0%
has proposed and the non-commercial
 
02:18:58.969 --> 02:18:58.979 align:start position:0%
language that representative Manos has
 
02:19:01.910 --> 02:19:01.920 align:start position:0%
proposed and if that Amendment passed
 
02:19:04.730 --> 02:19:04.740 align:start position:0%
and now we were voting on the underlying
 
02:19:07.310 --> 02:19:07.320 align:start position:0%
bill as amended and I asked for a show
 
02:19:09.650 --> 02:19:09.660 align:start position:0%
of hands how many people would vote all
 
02:19:12.290 --> 02:19:12.300 align:start position:0%
right sorry so if it says the commercial
 
02:19:14.030 --> 02:19:14.040 align:start position:0%
part in there doesn't mean that they
 
02:19:15.889 --> 02:19:15.899 align:start position:0%
could still accept commercial if they
 
02:19:18.110 --> 02:19:18.120 align:start position:0%
wanted to because like our town for
 
02:19:21.650 --> 02:19:21.660 align:start position:0%
example does do weddings and stuff as uh
 
02:19:24.950 --> 02:19:24.960 align:start position:0%
representative dilorenzo mentioned
 
02:19:27.230 --> 02:19:27.240 align:start position:0%
I and I would say yes it would just say
 
02:19:30.049 --> 02:19:30.059 align:start position:0%
they couldn't they couldn't say they
 
02:19:31.669 --> 02:19:31.679 align:start position:0%
couldn't say
 
02:19:33.709 --> 02:19:33.719 align:start position:0%
um that they don't have to but they
 
02:19:35.389 --> 02:19:35.399 align:start position:0%
could yes that's what I that's what I
 
02:19:39.469 --> 02:19:39.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:41.270 --> 02:19:41.280 align:start position:0%
I think we are all getting tired I think
 
02:19:42.469 --> 02:19:42.479 align:start position:0%
we are
 
02:19:44.990 --> 02:19:45.000 align:start position:0%
uh not that I don't love being with you
 
02:19:45.000 --> 02:19:46.310 align:start position:0%
uh not that I don't love being with you
all

02:19:46.310 --> 02:19:46.320 align:start position:0%
all
 
02:19:50.750 --> 02:19:50.760 align:start position:0%
um but do you think that the possibility
 
02:19:54.170 --> 02:19:54.180 align:start position:0%
that we're having so much trouble with
 
02:19:55.510 --> 02:19:55.520 align:start position:0%
this amendment
 
02:19:59.690 --> 02:19:59.700 align:start position:0%
is because this is really
 
02:20:03.770 --> 02:20:03.780 align:start position:0%
a local issue that should be settled
 
02:20:06.830 --> 02:20:06.840 align:start position:0%
locally allowing for the differences
 
02:20:10.810 --> 02:20:10.820 align:start position:0%
from one jurisdiction to another
 
02:20:13.910 --> 02:20:13.920 align:start position:0%
where niggling at little piece here and
 
02:20:17.630 --> 02:20:17.640 align:start position:0%
little piece there and I'm not sure we
 
02:20:20.690 --> 02:20:20.700 align:start position:0%
have to I think we might just
 
02:20:22.630 --> 02:20:22.640 align:start position:0%
say this
 
02:20:26.270 --> 02:20:26.280 align:start position:0%
we we understand the problem we respect
 
02:20:30.290 --> 02:20:30.300 align:start position:0%
the concern and we believe
 
02:20:32.270 --> 02:20:32.280 align:start position:0%
um that it is a decision that should be
 
02:20:35.030 --> 02:20:35.040 align:start position:0%
resolved locally not that we are a local
 
02:20:37.730 --> 02:20:37.740 align:start position:0%
control State we know we are not a local
 
02:20:41.090 --> 02:20:41.100 align:start position:0%
control state but nonetheless there are
 
02:20:43.630 --> 02:20:43.640 align:start position:0%
differences from Community to community
 
02:20:46.690 --> 02:20:46.700 align:start position:0%
and um
 
02:20:50.570 --> 02:20:50.580 align:start position:0%
and I'm reminded of something that we
 
02:20:54.650 --> 02:20:54.660 align:start position:0%
all tend to forget it's not our job
 
02:20:59.950 --> 02:20:59.960 align:start position:0%
to take a bill that doesn't quite
 
02:21:03.230 --> 02:21:03.240 align:start position:0%
measure up and try to find a way to have
 
02:21:06.950 --> 02:21:06.960 align:start position:0%
it measure up it is our place to take a
 
02:21:08.690 --> 02:21:08.700 align:start position:0%
good bill that does something that's
 
02:21:13.429 --> 02:21:13.439 align:start position:0%
clearly within our purview and try to
 
02:21:15.110 --> 02:21:15.120 align:start position:0%
you know correct
 
02:21:17.570 --> 02:21:17.580 align:start position:0%
try to improve it
 
02:21:18.889 --> 02:21:18.899 align:start position:0%
um and
 
02:21:22.190 --> 02:21:22.200 align:start position:0%
um I am very fond of the sponsor the
 
02:21:25.370 --> 02:21:25.380 align:start position:0%
sponsor and I co-sponsors on some bills
 
02:21:27.230 --> 02:21:27.240 align:start position:0%
so this is not
 
02:21:29.450 --> 02:21:29.460 align:start position:0%
anything about that it's just that I
 
02:21:29.460 --> 02:21:30.230 align:start position:0%
anything about that it's just that I
think

02:21:30.230 --> 02:21:30.240 align:start position:0%
think
 
02:21:34.490 --> 02:21:34.500 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:38.150 --> 02:21:38.160 align:start position:0%
other other comments
 
02:21:40.070 --> 02:21:40.080 align:start position:0%
yeah representative Alexander uh thank
 
02:21:42.830 --> 02:21:42.840 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair I don't see an amendment
 
02:21:44.630 --> 02:21:44.640 align:start position:0%
that will get a majority of the
 
02:21:47.389 --> 02:21:47.399 align:start position:0%
committee to vote ought to pass or ought
 
02:21:50.210 --> 02:21:50.220 align:start position:0%
to pass as an immense as amended so I
 
02:21:51.650 --> 02:21:51.660 align:start position:0%
would suggest
 
02:21:53.990 --> 02:21:54.000 align:start position:0%
that we just ideal
 
02:21:56.570 --> 02:21:56.580 align:start position:0%
right yeah so you know I guess what I I
 
02:21:57.830 --> 02:21:57.840 align:start position:0%
guess what I would like to say I mean I
 
02:21:59.690 --> 02:21:59.700 align:start position:0%
unders I believe me I sort of understand
 
02:22:01.670 --> 02:22:01.680 align:start position:0%
where this is going I don't I don't mean
 
02:22:04.490 --> 02:22:04.500 align:start position:0%
to suggest that I don't but I guess I do
 
02:22:06.889 --> 02:22:06.899 align:start position:0%
uh I have great respect for
 
02:22:09.110 --> 02:22:09.120 align:start position:0%
representative Smith but I do for the
 
02:22:11.030 --> 02:22:11.040 align:start position:0%
reasons I've said before I do feel that
 
02:22:14.330 --> 02:22:14.340 align:start position:0%
this is a significant problem uh not
 
02:22:16.849 --> 02:22:16.859 align:start position:0%
only in one town but you know generally
 
02:22:19.910 --> 02:22:19.920 align:start position:0%
so I would like to have a vote on the

02:26:27.410 --> 02:26:27.420 align:start position:0%
this is a this is a bad Bill I yeah uh I
 
02:26:27.420 --> 02:26:28.250 align:start position:0%
this is a this is a bad Bill I yeah uh I
think

02:26:28.250 --> 02:26:28.260 align:start position:0%
think
 
02:26:30.590 --> 02:26:30.600 align:start position:0%
what what's your
 
02:26:33.950 --> 02:26:33.960 align:start position:0%
is is I've said this is a local problem
 
02:26:38.210 --> 02:26:38.220 align:start position:0%
if if we make this a Statewide issue
 
02:26:41.389 --> 02:26:41.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:43.250 --> 02:26:43.260 align:start position:0%
take it to court and they're going to
 
02:26:45.950 --> 02:26:45.960 align:start position:0%
Define what is allowed and what's not
 
02:26:48.469 --> 02:26:48.479 align:start position:0%
allowed and that's a that's a problem
 
02:26:52.809 --> 02:26:52.819 align:start position:0%
because what may be suitable in say
 
02:26:57.230 --> 02:26:57.240 align:start position:0%
Nashua may not be suitable in Concord
 
02:26:59.330 --> 02:26:59.340 align:start position:0%
you know and I don't think I don't think
 
02:27:01.010 --> 02:27:01.020 align:start position:0%
that the the townspeople are going to be
 
02:27:03.290 --> 02:27:03.300 align:start position:0%
interested in In Living the Life of
 
02:27:04.969 --> 02:27:04.979 align:start position:0%
other people just because they got to
 
02:27:07.510 --> 02:27:07.520 align:start position:0%
the courts first so that's why I'm
 
02:27:09.530 --> 02:27:09.540 align:start position:0%
opposed to the bill
 
02:27:12.230 --> 02:27:12.240 align:start position:0%
