will set it for a
 
00:12:21.350 --> 00:12:21.360 align:start position:0%
minute uh at the conclusion of the
 
00:12:24.269 --> 00:12:24.279 align:start position:0%
minute the door will shut if you are on
 
00:12:26.829 --> 00:12:26.839 align:start position:0%
your way back the door will remain open
 
00:12:31.069 --> 00:12:31.079 align:start position:0%
for you um that is a new change the the
 
00:12:34.790 --> 00:12:34.800 align:start position:0%
other issue however is If U as we last
 
00:12:37.230 --> 00:12:37.240 align:start position:0%
week had several divisions in a row that
 
00:12:39.829 --> 00:12:39.839 align:start position:0%
there were just parliamentary inquiries
 
00:12:42.829 --> 00:12:42.839 align:start position:0%
um if nobody has left the chamber and on
 
00:12:45.870 --> 00:12:45.880 align:start position:0%
the previous vote everybody voted I will
 
00:12:48.350 --> 00:12:48.360 align:start position:0%
inform the speaker that nobody has left
 
00:12:51.550 --> 00:12:51.560 align:start position:0%
or come back and we can therefore
 
00:12:54.350 --> 00:12:54.360 align:start position:0%
proceed to vote without having to expend
 
00:12:57.189 --> 00:12:57.199 align:start position:0%
that minute so that is the change in the
 
00:13:03.310 --> 00:13:03.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:11.389 --> 00:13:11.399 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr Speaker good morning in the
 
00:14:35.910 --> 00:14:35.920 align:start position:0%
children and family law committee we

hear a lot about agreed parties parents
 
00:14:42.110 --> 00:14:42.120 align:start position:0%
spouses grandparents and caregivers
 
00:14:44.350 --> 00:14:44.360 align:start position:0%
there are warranted frustrations within
 
00:14:47.150 --> 00:14:47.160 align:start position:0%
our system especially in cases of
 
00:14:50.350 --> 00:14:50.360 align:start position:0%
custody parenting time and child support
 
00:14:52.790 --> 00:14:52.800 align:start position:0%
matters on the special committee looking
 
00:14:55.150 --> 00:14:55.160 align:start position:0%
at the family courts we took a close
 
00:14:57.230 --> 00:14:57.240 align:start position:0%
look at the bottlenecks that can prevent
 
00:14:59.389 --> 00:14:59.399 align:start position:0%
justices from happening happening within
 
00:15:02.790 --> 00:15:02.800 align:start position:0%
the family courts as a matter of fact in
 
00:15:05.189 --> 00:15:05.199 align:start position:0%
this body we have already passed a
 
00:15:07.069 --> 00:15:07.079 align:start position:0%
wellth thought out bipartisan
 
00:15:09.310 --> 00:15:09.320 align:start position:0%
legislation derived from the committee's
 
00:15:11.710 --> 00:15:11.720 align:start position:0%
work that covers the Notions that this
 
00:15:13.110 --> 00:15:13.120 align:start position:0%
bill is looking to
 
00:15:15.670 --> 00:15:15.680 align:start position:0%
remedy this bill states that it give
 
00:15:18.629 --> 00:15:18.639 align:start position:0%
judges gives judges latitude to assess
 
00:15:21.829 --> 00:15:21.839 align:start position:0%
penalties they already have that this
 
00:15:24.590 --> 00:15:24.600 align:start position:0%
bill also proposes that parents be
 
00:15:26.550 --> 00:15:26.560 align:start position:0%
incarcerated as a remedy to an
 
00:15:29.670 --> 00:15:29.680 align:start position:0%
incredibly complicated situation putting
 
00:15:31.470 --> 00:15:31.480 align:start position:0%
something like this in legislation would
 
00:15:33.910 --> 00:15:33.920 align:start position:0%
do the opposite of what we are working
 
00:15:36.550 --> 00:15:36.560 align:start position:0%
towards wanting families to be able to
 
00:15:39.749 --> 00:15:39.759 align:start position:0%
work together when possible this bill is
 
00:15:43.150 --> 00:15:43.160 align:start position:0%
not helpful and it is not necessary I
 
00:15:45.189 --> 00:15:45.199 align:start position:0%
urge you to push the red button so that
 
00:15:47.550 --> 00:15:47.560 align:start position:0%
a more appropriate motion can be made
 
00:15:50.030 --> 00:15:50.040 align:start position:0%
thank you the chair recognizes
 
00:15:57.910 --> 00:15:57.920 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr Speaker for recognizing me
 
00:16:12.389 --> 00:16:12.399 align:start position:0%

00:16:19.110 --> 00:16:19.120 align:start position:0%
1192 I agree with most of what my
 
00:16:21.710 --> 00:16:21.720 align:start position:0%
colleague just
 
00:16:26.829 --> 00:16:26.839 align:start position:0%
said Mr Speaker House Bill 1192 as
 
00:16:32.230 --> 00:16:32.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:34.910 --> 00:16:34.920 align:start position:0%
consistency most of what my colleague
 
00:16:38.910 --> 00:16:38.920 align:start position:0%
just said has nothing to do with
 
00:16:44.269 --> 00:16:44.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:46.710 --> 00:16:46.720 align:start position:0%
Court as you know I've been given the
 
00:16:48.749 --> 00:16:48.759 align:start position:0%
honor of serving on children and family
 
00:16:51.590 --> 00:16:51.600 align:start position:0%
law committee for approximately 16
 
00:16:55.910 --> 00:16:55.920 align:start position:0%
years during my tenure on that committee
 
00:16:59.590 --> 00:16:59.600 align:start position:0%
I've listened to testimony
 
00:17:02.309 --> 00:17:02.319 align:start position:0%
from many constituents colleagues
 
00:17:06.270 --> 00:17:06.280 align:start position:0%
agencies judges and attorneys concerning
 
00:17:08.029 --> 00:17:08.039 align:start position:0%
the fact that one of the many
 
00:17:10.230 --> 00:17:10.240 align:start position:0%
difficulties of divorce
 
00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:12.870 align:start position:0%

support and
 
00:17:24.470 --> 00:17:24.480 align:start position:0%
alimony is how does the law provide
 
00:17:27.029 --> 00:17:27.039 align:start position:0%
guidance to the court when a judge
 
00:17:30.190 --> 00:17:30.200 align:start position:0%
presiding over that Court Court finds
 
00:17:32.470 --> 00:17:32.480 align:start position:0%
that a person is in
 
00:17:37.110 --> 00:17:37.120 align:start position:0%
contempt of a particular ruling in said
 
00:17:40.549 --> 00:17:40.559 align:start position:0%
Court well it's not as simple as you may
 
00:17:43.630 --> 00:17:43.640 align:start position:0%
think actually the answer is quite
 
00:17:47.310 --> 00:17:47.320 align:start position:0%
complex because it
 
00:17:49.669 --> 00:17:49.679 align:start position:0%
depends it depends on whether the
 
00:17:52.190 --> 00:17:52.200 align:start position:0%
contempt issue constitutes criminal
 
00:17:55.789 --> 00:17:55.799 align:start position:0%
Behavior civil Behavior or a ruling in
 
00:17:57.149 --> 00:17:57.159 align:start position:0%
the Family
 
00:17:59.870 --> 00:17:59.880 align:start position:0%
Court statistics are
 
00:18:02.710 --> 00:18:02.720 align:start position:0%
showing that contempt Behavior has been
 
00:18:07.070 --> 00:18:07.080 align:start position:0%
on the rise in Family Court people are
 
00:18:10.990 --> 00:18:11.000 align:start position:0%
angry so even though when the court says
 
00:18:14.630 --> 00:18:14.640 align:start position:0%
you will allow the child of the parent
 
00:18:18.310 --> 00:18:18.320 align:start position:0%
to visit with that child you will pay
 
00:18:22.909 --> 00:18:22.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:26.830 --> 00:18:26.840 align:start position:0%
alimony people say I'm angry I'm not
 
00:18:31.630 --> 00:18:31.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:34.110 --> 00:18:34.120 align:start position:0%
contempt of court rulings verbiage is
 
00:18:34.120 --> 00:18:35.750 align:start position:0%
contempt of court rulings verbiage is
completely

00:18:35.750 --> 00:18:35.760 align:start position:0%

00:18:40.070 --> 00:18:40.080 align:start position:0%

only holds its place in the criminal
 
00:18:58.230 --> 00:18:58.240 align:start position:0%
statute I can't imagine how frustrating
 
00:19:00.950 --> 00:19:00.960 align:start position:0%
it must be for judges attorneys and
 
00:19:05.230 --> 00:19:05.240 align:start position:0%

1192 as
 
00:19:17.350 --> 00:19:17.360 align:start position:0%
amended speaks to that a judge in a
 
00:19:22.350 --> 00:19:22.360 align:start position:0%
criminal court May refer to RSA 4 uh 544
 
00:19:26.110 --> 00:19:26.120 align:start position:0%
40 and Rule 45 which is the criminal
 
00:19:29.870 --> 00:19:29.880 align:start position:0%
content statute and Rule which clearly
 
00:19:32.350 --> 00:19:32.360 align:start position:0%
gives guidance to the court on how to
 
00:19:35.430 --> 00:19:35.440 align:start position:0%
rule when the contempt is direct
 
00:19:38.789 --> 00:19:38.799 align:start position:0%
criminal contempt or indirect criminal
 
00:19:41.430 --> 00:19:41.440 align:start position:0%
contempt and the operative words there
 
00:19:41.440 --> 00:19:42.549 align:start position:0%
contempt and the operative words there
are

00:19:42.549 --> 00:19:42.559 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:19:45.230 --> 00:19:45.240 align:start position:0%
criminal the punishments are clearly
 
00:19:48.310 --> 00:19:48.320 align:start position:0%
listed and decided by the judge
 
00:19:52.390 --> 00:19:52.400 align:start position:0%
accordingly we find very few criminals
 
00:19:54.190 --> 00:19:54.200 align:start position:0%
in the family
 
00:19:56.789 --> 00:19:56.799 align:start position:0%
court in Criminal Court where you commit
 
00:19:59.149 --> 00:19:59.159 align:start position:0%
a crime you are found guilty or not
 
00:20:01.470 --> 00:20:01.480 align:start position:0%
guilty you are sentenced or not
 
00:20:04.789 --> 00:20:04.799 align:start position:0%
sentenced by the standards of the law in
 
00:20:07.070 --> 00:20:07.080 align:start position:0%
the Family Court which deals mostly with
 
00:20:09.669 --> 00:20:09.679 align:start position:0%
emotional issues nobody's really guilty
 
00:20:10.750 --> 00:20:10.760 align:start position:0%
of a
 
00:20:13.630 --> 00:20:13.640 align:start position:0%
crime and more times than not no
 
00:20:16.549 --> 00:20:16.559 align:start position:0%
criminal Behavior
 
00:20:19.430 --> 00:20:19.440 align:start position:0%
exists just
 
00:20:22.669 --> 00:20:22.679 align:start position:0%
anger judges still must make rulings
 
00:20:25.549 --> 00:20:25.559 align:start position:0%
according to the clear concise laws set
 
00:20:29.669 --> 00:20:29.679 align:start position:0%
before them with the exception of how to
 
00:20:33.110 --> 00:20:33.120 align:start position:0%
rule on cases where it is believed and
 
00:20:35.630 --> 00:20:35.640 align:start position:0%
perceived that someone is deplay
 
00:20:39.310 --> 00:20:39.320 align:start position:0%
displaying contemptuous Behavior against
 
00:20:40.510 --> 00:20:40.520 align:start position:0%
the Court's
 
00:20:44.710 --> 00:20:44.720 align:start position:0%
rulings this is where unfortunately the
 
00:20:48.710 --> 00:20:48.720 align:start position:0%
rsa's rules and laws are
 
00:20:55.110 --> 00:20:55.120 align:start position:0%
silent this is why House Bill 1192 is so
 
00:20:58.190 --> 00:20:58.200 align:start position:0%
important this bill speeds clearly to
 
00:20:59.950 --> 00:20:59.960 align:start position:0%
contemp contemptuous behavior and
 
00:21:03.870 --> 00:21:03.880 align:start position:0%
creates the necessary consistency in law
 
00:21:06.310 --> 00:21:06.320 align:start position:0%
most people who commit contempt of the
 
00:21:08.789 --> 00:21:08.799 align:start position:0%
rulings of the family court are not
 
00:21:12.510 --> 00:21:12.520 align:start position:0%
acting in a criminal be manner as I said
 
00:21:15.110 --> 00:21:15.120 align:start position:0%
so the penalties would not nor should
 
00:21:19.430 --> 00:21:19.440 align:start position:0%
they be as severe as a criminal case and
 
00:21:21.390 --> 00:21:21.400 align:start position:0%
this bill takes that into
 
00:21:24.310 --> 00:21:24.320 align:start position:0%
consideration House Bill 1192 is really
 
00:21:26.909 --> 00:21:26.919 align:start position:0%
just giving clear consistent guidance to
 
00:21:29.789 --> 00:21:29.799 align:start position:0%
the family court where it is asked for
 
00:21:33.510 --> 00:21:33.520 align:start position:0%
and needed finally Mr Speaker if I know
 
00:21:36.710 --> 00:21:36.720 align:start position:0%
that attorneys judges prosay litigant
 
00:21:39.669 --> 00:21:39.679 align:start position:0%
and prosay litigant have testified over
 
00:21:43.149 --> 00:21:43.159 align:start position:0%
and over and over that guidance and
 
00:21:46.350 --> 00:21:46.360 align:start position:0%
consistency in contempt violations would
 
00:21:49.070 --> 00:21:49.080 align:start position:0%
be of great assistance to them and the
 
00:21:51.350 --> 00:21:51.360 align:start position:0%
people that come before them and they
 
00:21:56.190 --> 00:21:56.200 align:start position:0%
deserve the clarity that this bill will
 
00:21:59.950 --> 00:21:59.960 align:start position:0%
bring then it only makes sense
 
00:22:04.310 --> 00:22:04.320 align:start position:0%

00:22:07.350 --> 00:22:07.360 align:start position:0%

morning

00:23:51.350 --> 00:23:51.360 align:start position:0%
morning
 
00:23:53.909 --> 00:23:53.919 align:start position:0%
everyone if I know that the special
 
00:23:55.990 --> 00:23:56.000 align:start position:0%
committee for the family courts has
 
00:23:59.390 --> 00:23:59.400 align:start position:0%
crafted sensible legislation to resolve
 
00:24:00.710 --> 00:24:00.720 align:start position:0%
these issues of
 
00:24:03.710 --> 00:24:03.720 align:start position:0%
contempt if I know that the courts
 
00:24:06.470 --> 00:24:06.480 align:start position:0%
already have the option to add penalties
 
00:24:10.230 --> 00:24:10.240 align:start position:0%
for not adhering to court orders without
 
00:24:10.240 --> 00:24:11.990 align:start position:0%
for not adhering to court orders without
vindictive

00:24:11.990 --> 00:24:12.000 align:start position:0%
vindictive
 
00:24:15.269 --> 00:24:15.279 align:start position:0%
measures and if I know that this bill
 
00:24:18.950 --> 00:24:18.960 align:start position:0%
attempts a one-size fits-all measure
 
00:24:22.390 --> 00:24:22.400 align:start position:0%
that historically has never worked when
 
00:24:25.190 --> 00:24:25.200 align:start position:0%
it comes to the family court system
 
00:24:27.870 --> 00:24:27.880 align:start position:0%
would I press the red button to oppose
 
00:24:30.789 --> 00:24:30.799 align:start position:0%

00:24:32.990 --> 00:24:33.000 align:start position:0%

Speaker if I don't recall any such
 
00:24:54.789 --> 00:24:54.799 align:start position:0%
discussion as was just discussed by my

00:25:00.190 --> 00:25:00.200 align:start position:0%
and I do
 
00:25:03.990 --> 00:25:04.000 align:start position:0%
know that the family court laws rules
 
00:25:07.510 --> 00:25:07.520 align:start position:0%
and rsas are silent concerning contempt
 
00:25:11.630 --> 00:25:11.640 align:start position:0%
actions and this bill would speak loudly
 
00:25:14.549 --> 00:25:14.559 align:start position:0%
and clearly to create consistency with
 
00:25:17.830 --> 00:25:17.840 align:start position:0%
other rsas where it is defined and
 
00:25:19.909 --> 00:25:19.919 align:start position:0%
necessary and if I know that those
 
00:25:23.070 --> 00:25:23.080 align:start position:0%
contempt violations are continuing to
 
00:25:26.870 --> 00:25:26.880 align:start position:0%
rise at an alarming rate and if I
 
00:25:30.029 --> 00:25:30.039 align:start position:0%
further know that the judges attorneys
 
00:25:33.350 --> 00:25:33.360 align:start position:0%
prosade litigants and families deserve
 
00:25:35.310 --> 00:25:35.320 align:start position:0%
that guidance and
 
00:25:38.430 --> 00:25:38.440 align:start position:0%
consistency then I know that I will be

Speaker both child and family law and
 
00:29:34.669 --> 00:29:34.679 align:start position:0%
the family court oversight committee
 
00:29:36.710 --> 00:29:36.720 align:start position:0%
heard testimony about parents who
 
00:29:39.389 --> 00:29:39.399 align:start position:0%
routinely ignore and violate parenting
 
00:29:42.669 --> 00:29:42.679 align:start position:0%
plans this is a problem parenting plans
 
00:29:45.110 --> 00:29:45.120 align:start position:0%
aren't just agreements between parents
 
00:29:47.029 --> 00:29:47.039 align:start position:0%
they are court orders and there should
 
00:29:49.710 --> 00:29:49.720 align:start position:0%
be consequences for repeatedly violating
 
00:29:49.720 --> 00:29:50.470 align:start position:0%
be consequences for repeatedly violating
the

00:29:50.470 --> 00:29:50.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:29:53.710 --> 00:29:53.720 align:start position:0%
terms however this bill is not the way
 
00:29:55.830 --> 00:29:55.840 align:start position:0%
to address the issue this body has
 
00:29:58.470 --> 00:29:58.480 align:start position:0%
already passed Bill's de session and and
 
00:30:01.269 --> 00:30:01.279 align:start position:0%
just this morning that give both the
 
00:30:03.590 --> 00:30:03.600 align:start position:0%
courts and parents tools and incentives
 
00:30:05.110 --> 00:30:05.120 align:start position:0%
to enforce
 
00:30:07.750 --> 00:30:07.760 align:start position:0%
compliance this bill however uses a
 
00:30:10.389 --> 00:30:10.399 align:start position:0%
sledgehammer where a scalpel is needed
 
00:30:12.830 --> 00:30:12.840 align:start position:0%
it treats every family's Circumstance
 
00:30:16.070 --> 00:30:16.080 align:start position:0%
the same without regard for differences
 
00:30:18.789 --> 00:30:18.799 align:start position:0%
and mandates that judges ignore the best
 
00:30:21.430 --> 00:30:21.440 align:start position:0%
interest of the child in favor of
 
00:30:25.029 --> 00:30:25.039 align:start position:0%
scripted compensatory time it ignores
 
00:30:27.389 --> 00:30:27.399 align:start position:0%
complex family dynamics that families
 
00:30:27.399 --> 00:30:28.549 align:start position:0%
complex family dynamics that families
experience

00:30:28.549 --> 00:30:28.559 align:start position:0%
experience
 
00:30:30.789 --> 00:30:30.799 align:start position:0%
when parents behaviors don't quite cross
 
00:30:33.909 --> 00:30:33.919 align:start position:0%
the line into serious injuries or abuse
 
00:30:37.389 --> 00:30:37.399 align:start position:0%
for example if we have a 13-year-old who
 
00:30:39.430 --> 00:30:39.440 align:start position:0%
presents with a large handprint bruise
 
00:30:41.630 --> 00:30:41.640 align:start position:0%
on the face and says that Mom has been
 
00:30:44.269 --> 00:30:44.279 align:start position:0%
drinking a lot and they've been fighting
 
00:30:47.830 --> 00:30:47.840 align:start position:0%
DCF gets called they ask Dad to hold the
 
00:30:51.269 --> 00:30:51.279 align:start position:0%
child for the weekend so that DCF can
 
00:30:54.269 --> 00:30:54.279 align:start position:0%
fully investigate what's going on Mom
 
00:30:56.710 --> 00:30:56.720 align:start position:0%
admits to drinking she drinks heavily
 
00:30:58.669 --> 00:30:58.679 align:start position:0%
she admits to hitting the child because
 
00:31:00.789 --> 00:31:00.799 align:start position:0%
the child is an adolescent and mouths
 
00:31:00.799 --> 00:31:01.830 align:start position:0%
the child is an adolescent and mouths
off

00:31:01.830 --> 00:31:01.840 align:start position:0%
off
 
00:31:04.870 --> 00:31:04.880 align:start position:0%
sometimes under New Hampshire
 
00:31:08.230 --> 00:31:08.240 align:start position:0%
law this is an unfounded
 
00:31:11.029 --> 00:31:11.039 align:start position:0%
report because bruising does not
 
00:31:13.629 --> 00:31:13.639 align:start position:0%
constitute injury with protracted harm
 
00:31:16.710 --> 00:31:16.720 align:start position:0%
or impairment and a 13-year-old is old
 
00:31:19.230 --> 00:31:19.240 align:start position:0%
enough to call for help so being drunk
 
00:31:23.389 --> 00:31:23.399 align:start position:0%
even habitually is not enough to make a
 
00:31:24.710 --> 00:31:24.720 align:start position:0%
finding of
 
00:31:27.350 --> 00:31:27.360 align:start position:0%
neglect therefore under the amendment
 
00:31:30.110 --> 00:31:30.120 align:start position:0%
that we just just passed the family
 
00:31:32.230 --> 00:31:32.240 align:start position:0%
court judge would be prohibited from
 
00:31:33.909 --> 00:31:33.919 align:start position:0%
considering the best interests of this
 
00:31:36.430 --> 00:31:36.440 align:start position:0%
child and would be required to award mom
 
00:31:38.750 --> 00:31:38.760 align:start position:0%
compensatory parenting time to make up
 
00:31:41.549 --> 00:31:41.559 align:start position:0%
for the weekend that she
 
00:31:44.990 --> 00:31:45.000 align:start position:0%
lost DCF might recommend counseling or
 
00:31:48.269 --> 00:31:48.279 align:start position:0%
parenting assistance but the way this
 
00:31:50.950 --> 00:31:50.960 align:start position:0%
this bill is worded the judge could not
 
00:31:53.830 --> 00:31:53.840 align:start position:0%
order it the judge would be required to
 
00:31:56.830 --> 00:31:56.840 align:start position:0%
return to the original parenting plan
 
00:31:56.840 --> 00:31:58.430 align:start position:0%
return to the original parenting plan
agreement

00:31:58.430 --> 00:31:58.440 align:start position:0%
agreement
 
00:32:01.190 --> 00:32:01.200 align:start position:0%
I don't believe that parents who act
 
00:32:03.750 --> 00:32:03.760 align:start position:0%
with DCF to protect their children
 
00:32:06.509 --> 00:32:06.519 align:start position:0%
should be punished because our abuse
 
00:32:08.870 --> 00:32:08.880 align:start position:0%
laws require extreme injury before the
 
00:32:12.029 --> 00:32:12.039 align:start position:0%
state can act I also believe that judges
 
00:32:13.710 --> 00:32:13.720 align:start position:0%
should have the discretion to consider
 
00:32:16.310 --> 00:32:16.320 align:start position:0%
all of the evidence before making
 
00:32:19.269 --> 00:32:19.279 align:start position:0%
decisions not just rely on one piece of
 
00:32:22.389 --> 00:32:22.399 align:start position:0%
evidence which is the DCF
 
00:32:24.950 --> 00:32:24.960 align:start position:0%
report we have other bills that address
 
00:32:26.789 --> 00:32:26.799 align:start position:0%
the cases where one parent basically
 
00:32:28.870 --> 00:32:28.880 align:start position:0%
kidnaps the child
 
00:32:31.029 --> 00:32:31.039 align:start position:0%
and we have better teeth for those bills
 
00:32:32.710 --> 00:32:32.720 align:start position:0%
like the one we passed this morning
 
00:32:34.750 --> 00:32:34.760 align:start position:0%
which would allow a judge to incarcerate
 
00:32:37.470 --> 00:32:37.480 align:start position:0%
the parent who did the
 
00:32:41.110 --> 00:32:41.120 align:start position:0%
kidnapping however this bill treats all
 
00:32:43.590 --> 00:32:43.600 align:start position:0%
parents the same whether you've kept the
 
00:32:45.190 --> 00:32:45.200 align:start position:0%
child for a weekend because you were
 
00:32:47.149 --> 00:32:47.159 align:start position:0%
worried about their safety or you kept
 
00:32:48.509 --> 00:32:48.519 align:start position:0%
them for two
 
00:32:52.029 --> 00:32:52.039 align:start position:0%
years I ask that we support the previous
 
00:32:54.909 --> 00:32:54.919 align:start position:0%
bills by pressing the red button on this
 
00:32:57.990 --> 00:32:58.000 align:start position:0%
bill for itl I'm sorry to overturn turn
 
00:33:00.710 --> 00:33:00.720 align:start position:0%
the OTP so another motion can be made uh
 
00:33:03.310 --> 00:33:03.320 align:start position:0%
and I ask for a division vote thank
 
00:33:10.750 --> 00:33:10.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:12.950 --> 00:33:12.960 align:start position:0%
Pearson thank you Mr
 
00:33:15.710 --> 00:33:15.720 align:start position:0%
Speaker Mr Speaker in my role as
 
00:33:18.830 --> 00:33:18.840 align:start position:0%
chairman of both children and family law
 
00:33:21.149 --> 00:33:21.159 align:start position:0%
committee and of the special committee
 
00:33:23.110 --> 00:33:23.120 align:start position:0%
for the Family Division of the circuit
 
00:33:26.230 --> 00:33:26.240 align:start position:0%
court and also in my role as part-time
 
00:33:28.590 --> 00:33:28.600 align:start position:0%
chief executive officer of a Kingston
 
00:33:32.430 --> 00:33:32.440 align:start position:0%
Wellness Center which has two Physicians
 
00:33:36.149 --> 00:33:36.159 align:start position:0%
and two certified counselors on staff I
 
00:33:38.350 --> 00:33:38.360 align:start position:0%
have come to learn how many divorced
 
00:33:40.590 --> 00:33:40.600 align:start position:0%
parents seldom or never see their
 
00:33:44.389 --> 00:33:44.399 align:start position:0%
children despite court-ordered parenting
 
00:33:47.430 --> 00:33:47.440 align:start position:0%
plans often the aggrieved parents then
 
00:33:49.909 --> 00:33:49.919 align:start position:0%
went to the police and unless there were
 
00:33:53.110 --> 00:33:53.120 align:start position:0%
credible allegations of severe abuse of
 
00:33:55.669 --> 00:33:55.679 align:start position:0%
the child the police referred the
 
00:33:58.830 --> 00:33:58.840 align:start position:0%
complainants back to the courts
 
00:34:00.990 --> 00:34:01.000 align:start position:0%
in the research done as to what would
 
00:34:03.870 --> 00:34:03.880 align:start position:0%
happen next I found a significant
 
00:34:06.830 --> 00:34:06.840 align:start position:0%
variety across the country in some
 
00:34:11.270 --> 00:34:11.280 align:start position:0%
states very red very blue and of various
 
00:34:14.109 --> 00:34:14.119 align:start position:0%
shades of purple there are laws on the
 
00:34:17.069 --> 00:34:17.079 align:start position:0%
books as to what the court may do next
 
00:34:21.109 --> 00:34:21.119 align:start position:0%
to punish those disagreeing disobeying
 
00:34:23.750 --> 00:34:23.760 align:start position:0%
parenting plans some states have felony
 
00:34:27.430 --> 00:34:27.440 align:start position:0%
charges others misdemeanors to force the
 
00:34:30.430 --> 00:34:30.440 align:start position:0%
parent guanting plan to be honored as
 
00:34:33.190 --> 00:34:33.200 align:start position:0%
the court had originally
 
00:34:35.470 --> 00:34:35.480 align:start position:0%
ordered however I also found that in
 
00:34:37.710 --> 00:34:37.720 align:start position:0%
other states there are no consequences
 
00:34:40.669 --> 00:34:40.679 align:start position:0%
to such willful contempt so the
 
00:34:43.710 --> 00:34:43.720 align:start position:0%
perpetrators can continue to harm both
 
00:34:46.430 --> 00:34:46.440 align:start position:0%
the other parent but especially the
 
00:34:48.950 --> 00:34:48.960 align:start position:0%
child we need something more on the
 
00:34:51.149 --> 00:34:51.159 align:start position:0%
books here in New Hampshire and is for
 
00:34:55.190 --> 00:34:55.200 align:start position:0%
that reason that HB 1659 was
 
00:34:58.030 --> 00:34:58.040 align:start position:0%
filed however in the children in family
 
00:35:00.910 --> 00:35:00.920 align:start position:0%
law committee there was a concern that
 
00:35:03.510 --> 00:35:03.520 align:start position:0%
the bill is originally submitted may
 
00:35:07.310 --> 00:35:07.320 align:start position:0%
have gone a bit too far for example if a
 
00:35:10.349 --> 00:35:10.359 align:start position:0%
child had been denied a visit to the
 
00:35:12.910 --> 00:35:12.920 align:start position:0%
other parent on every other
 
00:35:15.430 --> 00:35:15.440 align:start position:0%
Christmas the remedy would be for each
 
00:35:18.390 --> 00:35:18.400 align:start position:0%
of those Christmases to be made up in
 
00:35:20.510 --> 00:35:20.520 align:start position:0%
other words if the parenting plan called
 
00:35:22.710 --> 00:35:22.720 align:start position:0%
for the child to visit one parent every
 
00:35:24.990 --> 00:35:25.000 align:start position:0%
other Christmas and it was denied
 
00:35:28.230 --> 00:35:28.240 align:start position:0%
twice upon conviction of defiance of the
 
00:35:30.589 --> 00:35:30.599 align:start position:0%
plan the first parent would now have the
 
00:35:33.390 --> 00:35:33.400 align:start position:0%
child for four consecutive
 
00:35:36.069 --> 00:35:36.079 align:start position:0%
Christmases a bit much we
 
00:35:38.670 --> 00:35:38.680 align:start position:0%
thought also the bill as originally
 
00:35:40.990 --> 00:35:41.000 align:start position:0%
written would force the perpetrator upon
 
00:35:43.750 --> 00:35:43.760 align:start position:0%
conviction to pay a fine of $500 for
 
00:35:45.670 --> 00:35:45.680 align:start position:0%
every day of
 
00:35:47.750 --> 00:35:47.760 align:start position:0%
non-compliance the amendment lowered
 
00:35:53.030 --> 00:35:53.040 align:start position:0%
this to just one 500 payment for
 
00:35:55.230 --> 00:35:55.240 align:start position:0%
non-compliance no
 
00:35:58.510 --> 00:35:58.520 align:start position:0%
Sledgehammer also the amendment gave
 
00:36:02.309 --> 00:36:02.319 align:start position:0%
more discretion to the judge reading
 
00:36:06.430 --> 00:36:06.440 align:start position:0%
over this amendment yes more discretion
 
00:36:09.550 --> 00:36:09.560 align:start position:0%
to the judge because as we all know no
 
00:36:11.870 --> 00:36:11.880 align:start position:0%
two court cases are
 
00:36:14.670 --> 00:36:14.680 align:start position:0%
alike so I believe the amendment we just
 
00:36:17.309 --> 00:36:17.319 align:start position:0%
passed made a good bill much better and
 
00:36:18.589 --> 00:36:18.599 align:start position:0%
much more
 
00:36:20.750 --> 00:36:20.760 align:start position:0%
reasonable over the years in my
 
00:36:23.870 --> 00:36:23.880 align:start position:0%
professional capacity I have witnessed
 
00:36:26.990 --> 00:36:27.000 align:start position:0%
firsthand not only the utter sadness of
 
00:36:29.390 --> 00:36:29.400 align:start position:0%
parents and grandparents who have denied
 
00:36:32.109 --> 00:36:32.119 align:start position:0%
appropriate visits with their children
 
00:36:35.710 --> 00:36:35.720 align:start position:0%
but also I have noted psychological and
 
00:36:38.910 --> 00:36:38.920 align:start position:0%
emotional scars in the children denied
 
00:36:38.920 --> 00:36:40.510 align:start position:0%
emotional scars in the children denied
appropriate

00:36:40.510 --> 00:36:40.520 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
00:36:43.390 --> 00:36:43.400 align:start position:0%
visitation so I asked my staff
 
00:36:47.309 --> 00:36:47.319 align:start position:0%
counselors what does dsm5 say this is
 
00:36:50.150 --> 00:36:50.160 align:start position:0%

00:37:07.990 --> 00:37:08.000 align:start position:0%

00:37:11.710 --> 00:37:11.720 align:start position:0%
pathogenic parenting syndromes appearing
 
00:37:11.720 --> 00:37:12.589 align:start position:0%
pathogenic parenting syndromes appearing
in

00:37:12.589 --> 00:37:12.599 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:37:14.710 --> 00:37:14.720 align:start position:0%
children sometimes when parents
 
00:37:17.309 --> 00:37:17.319 align:start position:0%
weaponize the child as a way of wreaking
 
00:37:20.630 --> 00:37:20.640 align:start position:0%
Vengeance against the other parent too
 
00:37:23.470 --> 00:37:23.480 align:start position:0%
often this creates an observable level
 
00:37:26.510 --> 00:37:26.520 align:start position:0%
of Psychopathology in the child and as
 
00:37:29.470 --> 00:37:29.480 align:start position:0%
such is deemed psychological child
 
00:37:32.950 --> 00:37:32.960 align:start position:0%
abuse all of this and much more in great
 
00:37:36.550 --> 00:37:36.560 align:start position:0%
clinical and scientific detail confirms
 
00:37:38.990 --> 00:37:39.000 align:start position:0%
what so many of us have observed in some
 
00:37:41.270 --> 00:37:41.280 align:start position:0%
cases where a parenting plan is
 
00:37:41.280 --> 00:37:43.030 align:start position:0%
cases where a parenting plan is
willfully

00:37:43.030 --> 00:37:43.040 align:start position:0%
willfully
 
00:37:45.870 --> 00:37:45.880 align:start position:0%
disregarded I believe that house bill
 
00:37:49.510 --> 00:37:49.520 align:start position:0%
1659 is amended gives the courts a
 
00:37:52.670 --> 00:37:52.680 align:start position:0%
better enforcement mechanism against the
 
00:37:55.430 --> 00:37:55.440 align:start position:0%
disregarding of court-ordered parenting
 
00:37:57.990 --> 00:37:58.000 align:start position:0%
plans Mr Speaker I hope my colleagues
 
00:38:00.390 --> 00:38:00.400 align:start position:0%
will push the green button and while I
 
00:38:02.630 --> 00:38:02.640 align:start position:0%
know this phrase has become somewhat of
 
00:38:05.710 --> 00:38:05.720 align:start position:0%
a cliche here I think this is true we
 
00:38:09.430 --> 00:38:09.440 align:start position:0%
need to do this for the children thank

that custody matters are of best
 
00:39:44.069 --> 00:39:44.079 align:start position:0%
interest of the child and this bill
 
00:39:47.030 --> 00:39:47.040 align:start position:0%
prevents the court from considering it
 
00:39:51.109 --> 00:39:51.119 align:start position:0%
and if I also know if I also believe
 
00:39:52.870 --> 00:39:52.880 align:start position:0%
that there are a lot of people that came
 
00:39:54.589 --> 00:39:54.599 align:start position:0%
that are going through this issue and
 
00:39:56.990 --> 00:39:57.000 align:start position:0%
this bill does not address them because
 
00:39:59.190 --> 00:39:59.200 align:start position:0%
this bill doesn't become effective or
 
00:40:01.230 --> 00:40:01.240 align:start position:0%
does not address anything prior to
 
00:40:05.950 --> 00:40:05.960 align:start position:0%

00:40:08.829 --> 00:40:08.839 align:start position:0%

inquiry thank you Mr Speaker and good
 
00:40:22.750 --> 00:40:22.760 align:start position:0%
morning if I know that when parents
 
00:40:25.309 --> 00:40:25.319 align:start position:0%
weaponize the child as a way to get back
 
00:40:27.829 --> 00:40:27.839 align:start position:0%
at the child's other parent it leaves
 
00:40:30.190 --> 00:40:30.200 align:start position:0%
lasting scars on the child's emotional
 
00:40:33.230 --> 00:40:33.240 align:start position:0%
well-being and if I know that if there
 
00:40:35.510 --> 00:40:35.520 align:start position:0%
are no repercussions for misconduct the
 
00:40:37.349 --> 00:40:37.359 align:start position:0%
likelihood that the offense will be
 
00:40:37.359 --> 00:40:38.710 align:start position:0%
likelihood that the offense will be
repeated

00:40:38.710 --> 00:40:38.720 align:start position:0%
repeated
 
00:40:41.349 --> 00:40:41.359 align:start position:0%
increases and if I know that this bill
 
00:40:43.270 --> 00:40:43.280 align:start position:0%
as amended will help the course enforce
 
00:40:45.990 --> 00:40:46.000 align:start position:0%

00:48:51.230 --> 00:48:51.240 align:start position:0%
employer's own property under this bill
 
00:48:52.870 --> 00:48:52.880 align:start position:0%
it would not only be illegal for a New
 
00:48:54.829 --> 00:48:54.839 align:start position:0%
Hampshire employer to have or enforce
 
00:48:58.710 --> 00:48:58.720 align:start position:0%
such an a policy but also Employers in
 
00:49:01.390 --> 00:49:01.400 align:start position:0%
our state would also be banned from even
 
00:49:03.870 --> 00:49:03.880 align:start position:0%
asking employees if they have weapons
 
00:49:05.750 --> 00:49:05.760 align:start position:0%
stored in their
 
00:49:08.430 --> 00:49:08.440 align:start position:0%
cars the floor Amendment uh the
 
00:49:10.589 --> 00:49:10.599 align:start position:0%
amendment before us now aims to take the
 
00:49:12.990 --> 00:49:13.000 align:start position:0%
edge off this by limiting the reach of
 
00:49:15.750 --> 00:49:15.760 align:start position:0%
this statute to employers who receive
 
00:49:18.309 --> 00:49:18.319 align:start position:0%
public or uh who receive public or
 
00:49:20.510 --> 00:49:20.520 align:start position:0%
private funds I would remind you that
 
00:49:23.349 --> 00:49:23.359 align:start position:0%
there are employers of all sizes uh in
 
00:49:26.069 --> 00:49:26.079 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire who have contractual uh
 
00:49:28.069 --> 00:49:28.079 align:start position:0%
relationship with both the state and
 
00:49:31.710 --> 00:49:31.720 align:start position:0%
federal governments uh and in 2022 alone
 
00:49:34.430 --> 00:49:34.440 align:start position:0%
there were nearly 300 New Hampshire
 
00:49:38.829 --> 00:49:38.839 align:start position:0%
small businesses who won $188 million uh
 
00:49:41.990 --> 00:49:42.000 align:start position:0%
in contracts uh from the government uh
 
00:49:43.950 --> 00:49:43.960 align:start position:0%
we also happened to have some extremely
 
00:49:47.630 --> 00:49:47.640 align:start position:0%
large employers like baa systems uh who
 
00:49:49.510 --> 00:49:49.520 align:start position:0%
it seems might have some pretty good
 
00:49:52.109 --> 00:49:52.119 align:start position:0%
reasons for restricting uh firearms on
 
00:49:52.119 --> 00:49:53.430 align:start position:0%
reasons for restricting uh firearms on
their

00:49:53.430 --> 00:49:53.440 align:start position:0%
their
 
00:49:56.750 --> 00:49:56.760 align:start position:0%
property to be very clear in this state
 
00:49:59.069 --> 00:49:59.079 align:start position:0%
people who aren't felons domestic
 
00:50:01.309 --> 00:50:01.319 align:start position:0%
violence offenders or subject to a
 
00:50:02.990 --> 00:50:03.000 align:start position:0%
protective order have the right to
 
00:50:05.510 --> 00:50:05.520 align:start position:0%
possess a firearm but there has never
 
00:50:07.789 --> 00:50:07.799 align:start position:0%
been a right in this state to bring that
 
00:50:09.750 --> 00:50:09.760 align:start position:0%
firearm to private property where the
 
00:50:12.150 --> 00:50:12.160 align:start position:0%
owner has made it very clear to you that
 
00:50:14.630 --> 00:50:14.640 align:start position:0%
they do not allow firearms on their
 
00:50:17.150 --> 00:50:17.160 align:start position:0%
property one of the main advantages of
 
00:50:19.710 --> 00:50:19.720 align:start position:0%
being a property owner is the right to
 
00:50:22.829 --> 00:50:22.839 align:start position:0%
use your land as you see fit even if
 
00:50:25.270 --> 00:50:25.280 align:start position:0%
others disagree with your
 
00:50:27.910 --> 00:50:27.920 align:start position:0%
reasons one of the main advantages of
 
00:50:30.230 --> 00:50:30.240 align:start position:0%
starting and running a business is to be
 
00:50:33.549 --> 00:50:33.559 align:start position:0%
able to set policies that preserve
 
00:50:35.710 --> 00:50:35.720 align:start position:0%
confidentiality govern acceptable
 
00:50:38.750 --> 00:50:38.760 align:start position:0%
behavior and protect workplace safety in
 
00:50:40.950 --> 00:50:40.960 align:start position:0%
a way that fits the culture that you're
 
00:50:43.190 --> 00:50:43.200 align:start position:0%
trying to create as a business owner
 
00:50:45.510 --> 00:50:45.520 align:start position:0%
even if some people object to these
 
00:50:47.870 --> 00:50:47.880 align:start position:0%
policies or find them
 
00:50:49.950 --> 00:50:49.960 align:start position:0%
inconvenient what this amendment and the
 
00:50:52.589 --> 00:50:52.599 align:start position:0%
underlying though would do is impose a
 
00:50:55.109 --> 00:50:55.119 align:start position:0%
one-size fits-all ban on all New
 
00:50:57.990 --> 00:50:58.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire employers uh that fails to
 
00:51:00.430 --> 00:51:00.440 align:start position:0%
take into account even sensible
 
00:51:04.349 --> 00:51:04.359 align:start position:0%
exemption exemptions so even an employer
 
00:51:06.349 --> 00:51:06.359 align:start position:0%
who has no objections to the presence of
 
00:51:08.910 --> 00:51:08.920 align:start position:0%
guns on principle may have very good
 
00:51:10.710 --> 00:51:10.720 align:start position:0%
reasons for barring them from company
 
00:51:13.349 --> 00:51:13.359 align:start position:0%
property is a general practice for
 
00:51:15.549 --> 00:51:15.559 align:start position:0%
example a daycare center where an
 
00:51:17.510 --> 00:51:17.520 align:start position:0%
unlocked car and a curious child could
 
00:51:20.430 --> 00:51:20.440 align:start position:0%
lead to a tragedy a defense contractor
 
00:51:23.910 --> 00:51:23.920 align:start position:0%
concerned about terrorism or a domestic
 
00:51:26.990 --> 00:51:27.000 align:start position:0%
violence shelter all of those business
 
00:51:29.069 --> 00:51:29.079 align:start position:0%
may have a very good reason not to want
 
00:51:31.789 --> 00:51:31.799 align:start position:0%
guns anywhere near their property and
 
00:51:33.670 --> 00:51:33.680 align:start position:0%
finally something that I wanted to call
 
00:51:35.750 --> 00:51:35.760 align:start position:0%
your attention to uh that's in the
 
00:51:38.069 --> 00:51:38.079 align:start position:0%
amendment in the underlying Bill itself
 
00:51:40.349 --> 00:51:40.359 align:start position:0%
is a provision that basically provides
 
00:51:42.710 --> 00:51:42.720 align:start position:0%
civil immunity to an employer if
 
00:51:44.230 --> 00:51:44.240 align:start position:0%
anything bad
 
00:51:47.670 --> 00:51:47.680 align:start position:0%
happens the reason that that's in there
 
00:51:50.750 --> 00:51:50.760 align:start position:0%
is because there is a possibility that
 
00:51:54.309 --> 00:51:54.319 align:start position:0%
something bad can happen as a result of
 
00:51:57.589 --> 00:51:57.599 align:start position:0%
this law so what I would ask you to do
 
00:52:00.750 --> 00:52:00.760 align:start position:0%
is to please put it all together uh
 
00:52:03.390 --> 00:52:03.400 align:start position:0%
protect the rights of our employees of
 
00:52:06.430 --> 00:52:06.440 align:start position:0%
our employers uh to protect their people
 
00:52:09.710 --> 00:52:09.720 align:start position:0%
uh and please respect uh property rights
 
00:52:12.950 --> 00:52:12.960 align:start position:0%
in this state thank you and I would urge
 
00:52:15.109 --> 00:52:15.119 align:start position:0%
you to vote uh to vote no on the
 
00:52:16.670 --> 00:52:16.680 align:start position:0%
amendment and to vote no on the
 
00:52:19.630 --> 00:52:19.640 align:start position:0%
underlying Bill thank you J recognize
 
00:52:19.640 --> 00:52:22.630 align:start position:0%

representative

00:52:22.630 --> 00:52:22.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:26.150 --> 00:52:26.160 align:start position:0%
Roy thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker I am
 
00:52:28.630 --> 00:52:28.640 align:start position:0%
just so grateful at my colleague's
 
00:52:30.829 --> 00:52:30.839 align:start position:0%
newfound love of the
 
00:52:35.030 --> 00:52:35.040 align:start position:0%
Constitution um this um that is great
 
00:52:38.630 --> 00:52:38.640 align:start position:0%
that is amazing that we want to um how
 
00:52:39.829 --> 00:52:39.839 align:start position:0%
will be in
 
00:52:43.230 --> 00:52:43.240 align:start position:0%
order adults are
 
00:52:46.910 --> 00:52:46.920 align:start position:0%
talking we have a constitutional right
 
00:52:48.030 --> 00:52:48.040 align:start position:0%
to carry
 
00:52:51.390 --> 00:52:51.400 align:start position:0%
firearms now I heard my colleagues last
 
00:52:53.910 --> 00:52:53.920 align:start position:0%
time say but wait a minute we don't want
 
00:52:56.190 --> 00:52:56.200 align:start position:0%
to interfere in private business and and
 
00:52:58.109 --> 00:52:58.119 align:start position:0%
we heard that and that makes that makes
 
00:53:01.069 --> 00:53:01.079 align:start position:0%
sense but if you get money from the
 
00:53:04.470 --> 00:53:04.480 align:start position:0%
government from the taxpayer from our
 
00:53:07.910 --> 00:53:07.920 align:start position:0%
pockets then you become liable to the
 
00:53:10.510 --> 00:53:10.520 align:start position:0%
same rules as the government's rules so
 
00:53:12.549 --> 00:53:12.559 align:start position:0%
if you have a business and you get money
 
00:53:15.430 --> 00:53:15.440 align:start position:0%
from the taxpayer you cannot say to the
 
00:53:16.829 --> 00:53:16.839 align:start position:0%
people that work for you you don't have
 
00:53:18.990 --> 00:53:19.000 align:start position:0%
your constitutional rights so all this
 
00:53:21.349 --> 00:53:21.359 align:start position:0%
does is it says any business who does
 
00:53:24.109 --> 00:53:24.119 align:start position:0%
business with the government they cannot
 
00:53:26.829 --> 00:53:26.839 align:start position:0%
ban people from Firearms they cannot
 
00:53:28.789 --> 00:53:28.799 align:start position:0%
tell people they cannot have firearms in
 
00:53:31.789 --> 00:53:31.799 align:start position:0%
their vehicles they cannot search their
 
00:53:34.950 --> 00:53:34.960 align:start position:0%
vehicles again someone who can't bring
 
00:53:37.390 --> 00:53:37.400 align:start position:0%
their gun to work can't have their gun
 
00:53:40.510 --> 00:53:40.520 align:start position:0%
at all so for the vast majority of the
 
00:53:43.190 --> 00:53:43.200 align:start position:0%
week except for two days you don't have
 
00:53:45.589 --> 00:53:45.599 align:start position:0%

fits-all solution on New Hampshire
 
00:58:02.589 --> 00:58:02.599 align:start position:0%
employers that conflicts with their

workplace safety policies and that those
 
00:58:07.109 --> 00:58:07.119 align:start position:0%
policies exist to protect the safety of

Simpson thank you Mr
 
01:03:41.990 --> 01:03:42.000 align:start position:0%
Speaker I rise in opposition to the otpa
 
01:03:45.750 --> 01:03:45.760 align:start position:0%
motion on HB 1205 and I would ask my
 
01:03:47.870 --> 01:03:47.880 align:start position:0%
colleagues supporting this bill to
 
01:03:50.589 --> 01:03:50.599 align:start position:0%
reconsider their position for three key
 
01:03:53.710 --> 01:03:53.720 align:start position:0%
reasons I have significant concerns
 
01:03:55.750 --> 01:03:55.760 align:start position:0%
first with student privacy conc
 
01:03:58.309 --> 01:03:58.319 align:start position:0%
concerning government documents second
 
01:04:00.710 --> 01:04:00.720 align:start position:0%
with conflict with federal law and a
 
01:04:02.390 --> 01:04:02.400 align:start position:0%
potential loss of federal funding for
 
01:04:05.510 --> 01:04:05.520 align:start position:0%
school districts and third with issues
 
01:04:06.950 --> 01:04:06.960 align:start position:0%
of gender
 
01:04:10.630 --> 01:04:10.640 align:start position:0%
equality first HB 1205 as amended
 
01:04:12.390 --> 01:04:12.400 align:start position:0%
requires that every single student
 
01:04:14.269 --> 01:04:14.279 align:start position:0%
athlete from fifth grade which is
 
01:04:16.510 --> 01:04:16.520 align:start position:0%
typically 10 years old through 12th
 
01:04:18.230 --> 01:04:18.240 align:start position:0%
grade must provide their birth
 
01:04:19.750 --> 01:04:19.760 align:start position:0%
certificate to be eligible to
 
01:04:23.150 --> 01:04:23.160 align:start position:0%
participate in any sport any sport there
 
01:04:25.150 --> 01:04:25.160 align:start position:0%
is no explanation in the bill as to who
 
01:04:27.190 --> 01:04:27.200 align:start position:0%
collects the birth certificate who
 
01:04:29.390 --> 01:04:29.400 align:start position:0%
verifies it whether it needs to be
 
01:04:30.910 --> 01:04:30.920 align:start position:0%
stored at the school district for a
 
01:04:33.269 --> 01:04:33.279 align:start position:0%
certain period of Time how often it
 
01:04:35.230 --> 01:04:35.240 align:start position:0%
needs to be shown or if the
 
01:04:37.190 --> 01:04:37.200 align:start position:0%
documentation is destroyed after a
 
01:04:39.950 --> 01:04:39.960 align:start position:0%
period of time this bill requires
 
01:04:41.789 --> 01:04:41.799 align:start position:0%
private documents to be submitted with
 
01:04:44.470 --> 01:04:44.480 align:start position:0%
no steps to maintain family
 
01:04:46.589 --> 01:04:46.599 align:start position:0%
privacy according to the bill if the
 
01:04:48.230 --> 01:04:48.240 align:start position:0%
parents do not feel comfortable bringing
 
01:04:50.029 --> 01:04:50.039 align:start position:0%
in the birth certificate because after
 
01:04:51.710 --> 01:04:51.720 align:start position:0%
all we're Granite Staters and we care
 
01:04:54.069 --> 01:04:54.079 align:start position:0%
deeply about privacy the parents who
 
01:04:55.710 --> 01:04:55.720 align:start position:0%
want their child to participate in
 
01:04:58.589 --> 01:04:58.599 align:start position:0%
Sports must provide other evidence but
 
01:05:00.470 --> 01:05:00.480 align:start position:0%
there's no specification in this bill of
 
01:05:03.309 --> 01:05:03.319 align:start position:0%
what other evidence is acceptable so a
 
01:05:05.309 --> 01:05:05.319 align:start position:0%
student may need to disrobe in front of
 
01:05:07.470 --> 01:05:07.480 align:start position:0%
a school official to prove who they are
 
01:05:09.829 --> 01:05:09.839 align:start position:0%
so they can participate in sports for
 
01:05:12.710 --> 01:05:12.720 align:start position:0%
fun with their friends we should all be
 
01:05:14.430 --> 01:05:14.440 align:start position:0%
Gravely concerned about the Privacy
 
01:05:16.630 --> 01:05:16.640 align:start position:0%
implications and potential violations of
 
01:05:19.710 --> 01:05:19.720 align:start position:0%
this bill the second significant concern
 
01:05:22.549 --> 01:05:22.559 align:start position:0%
is how hb25 conflicts with Federal Title
 
01:05:27.710 --> 01:05:27.720 align:start position:0%
9 law Title 9 says that no person shall
 
01:05:30.510 --> 01:05:30.520 align:start position:0%
on the basis of sex be excluded from
 
01:05:32.710 --> 01:05:32.720 align:start position:0%
participation under any education
 
01:05:37.069 --> 01:05:37.079 align:start position:0%
program or activity HB 1205 explicitly
 
01:05:40.109 --> 01:05:40.119 align:start position:0%
states that girl sports teams quote
 
01:05:41.950 --> 01:05:41.960 align:start position:0%
shall not be open to students of the
 
01:05:45.190 --> 01:05:45.200 align:start position:0%
male sex end quote but Title Nine says
 
01:05:47.789 --> 01:05:47.799 align:start position:0%
students cannot be excluded based on sex
 
01:05:50.710 --> 01:05:50.720 align:start position:0%
from any activity this means that to
 
01:05:53.430 --> 01:05:53.440 align:start position:0%
comply with Title 9 schools under HB
 
01:05:56.309 --> 01:05:56.319 align:start position:0%
1205 will not be edible eligible for
 
01:05:58.990 --> 01:05:59.000 align:start position:0%
federal funding if they offer a girls
 
01:06:02.150 --> 01:06:02.160 align:start position:0%
team but not a corresponding boys team
 
01:06:04.190 --> 01:06:04.200 align:start position:0%
as this bill says that boys cannot play
 
01:06:07.150 --> 01:06:07.160 align:start position:0%
on teams that are designated for girls
 
01:06:10.589 --> 01:06:10.599 align:start position:0%
only let's use volleyball as an example
 
01:06:12.269 --> 01:06:12.279 align:start position:0%
if a school district does not have
 
01:06:14.269 --> 01:06:14.279 align:start position:0%
enough boys to field a boy volleyball
 
01:06:16.549 --> 01:06:16.559 align:start position:0%
team but the District offers a girls
 
01:06:20.309 --> 01:06:20.319 align:start position:0%
volleyball team if HB 1205 were to pass
 
01:06:22.670 --> 01:06:22.680 align:start position:0%
boys would be excluded based on sex from
 
01:06:25.670 --> 01:06:25.680 align:start position:0%
participating in this activity excluding
 
01:06:28.190 --> 01:06:28.200 align:start position:0%
boys from a girls team if there's no
 
01:06:30.549 --> 01:06:30.559 align:start position:0%
boys volleyball team is a violation of
 
01:06:34.589 --> 01:06:34.599 align:start position:0%
Title 9 to be clear hb1 1205 is in
 
01:06:36.670 --> 01:06:36.680 align:start position:0%
direct violation of Title 9 and federal
 
01:06:39.190 --> 01:06:39.200 align:start position:0%
funding to school districts could be
 
01:06:41.670 --> 01:06:41.680 align:start position:0%
withheld however this bill does offer a
 
01:06:43.789 --> 01:06:43.799 align:start position:0%
solution to this conflict with federal
 
01:06:46.589 --> 01:06:46.599 align:start position:0%
law girls teams could instead be
 
01:06:47.990 --> 01:06:48.000 align:start position:0%
designated as
 
01:06:50.710 --> 01:06:50.720 align:start position:0%
co-ed but we should ask ourselves what
 
01:06:52.510 --> 01:06:52.520 align:start position:0%
could happen if all girls teams are
 
01:06:54.829 --> 01:06:54.839 align:start position:0%
designated co-ed in order to comply with
 
01:06:56.950 --> 01:06:56.960 align:start position:0%
federal law
 
01:07:00.230 --> 01:07:00.240 align:start position:0%
it is safe to assume that more cisgender
 
01:07:02.430 --> 01:07:02.440 align:start position:0%
boys would participate which could then
 
01:07:04.510 --> 01:07:04.520 align:start position:0%
limit the opportunities of girls and
 
01:07:06.470 --> 01:07:06.480 align:start position:0%
bump girls off the starting
 
01:07:09.069 --> 01:07:09.079 align:start position:0%
roster the supporters of this bill claim
 
01:07:11.269 --> 01:07:11.279 align:start position:0%
to care about protecting women yet in
 
01:07:12.910 --> 01:07:12.920 align:start position:0%
their apparent quest to exclude
 
01:07:15.269 --> 01:07:15.279 align:start position:0%
transgender students from participating
 
01:07:17.390 --> 01:07:17.400 align:start position:0%
they are directly harming cisgender
 
01:07:19.950 --> 01:07:19.960 align:start position:0%
girls this isn't about transgender
 
01:07:22.190 --> 01:07:22.200 align:start position:0%
athletes passage of this bill would
 
01:07:25.510 --> 01:07:25.520 align:start position:0%
encourage or even require districts to
 
01:07:27.589 --> 01:07:27.599 align:start position:0%
to eliminate girl Sports in order to
 
01:07:30.269 --> 01:07:30.279 align:start position:0%
comply with Title 9 federal law so they
 
01:07:32.910 --> 01:07:32.920 align:start position:0%
can continue to receive federal
 
01:07:35.230 --> 01:07:35.240 align:start position:0%
funding this brings me to the third
 
01:07:37.750 --> 01:07:37.760 align:start position:0%
concern protecting gender
 
01:07:40.430 --> 01:07:40.440 align:start position:0%
equality Title 9 ensures that all
 
01:07:42.710 --> 01:07:42.720 align:start position:0%
students have access to an activity and
 
01:07:45.630 --> 01:07:45.640 align:start position:0%
cannot be excluded based on their sex
 
01:07:47.990 --> 01:07:48.000 align:start position:0%
Title Nine protect student athletes
 
01:07:50.109 --> 01:07:50.119 align:start position:0%
ensuring they can participate in the
 
01:07:52.990 --> 01:07:53.000 align:start position:0%
sport at their school if it is offered
 
01:07:54.510 --> 01:07:54.520 align:start position:0%
even if it's not offered for their

start participating in sports in the
 
01:08:01.950 --> 01:08:01.960 align:start position:0%
first place so they could have
 
01:08:05.150 --> 01:08:05.160 align:start position:0%
protections and access so they would be
 
01:08:09.510 --> 01:08:09.520 align:start position:0%
not excluded by boys only teams HB 1205
 
01:08:11.549 --> 01:08:11.559 align:start position:0%

n was passed in
 
01:08:15.549 --> 01:08:15.559 align:start position:0%
1972 we would be responsible for
 
01:08:17.349 --> 01:08:17.359 align:start position:0%
eliminating opportunities for student
 
01:08:19.749 --> 01:08:19.759 align:start position:0%
athletes across the state by passing a
 
01:08:22.510 --> 01:08:22.520 align:start position:0%
law in direct conflict with Title
 
01:08:25.269 --> 01:08:25.279 align:start position:0%
9 I also want to address a story that's
 
01:08:27.550 --> 01:08:27.560 align:start position:0%
been told in the public hearing and the
 
01:08:29.390 --> 01:08:29.400 align:start position:0%
executive session for this
 
01:08:31.990 --> 01:08:32.000 align:start position:0%
bill the story is about a field hockey
 
01:08:34.630 --> 01:08:34.640 align:start position:0%
game in which a girl was injured she was
 
01:08:36.789 --> 01:08:36.799 align:start position:0%
hit in the face by a field hockey ball
 
01:08:39.669 --> 01:08:39.679 align:start position:0%
and it was a significant injury this
 
01:08:41.709 --> 01:08:41.719 align:start position:0%
story has been used to blame a
 
01:08:44.510 --> 01:08:44.520 align:start position:0%
transgender girl but that's not the
 
01:08:47.709 --> 01:08:47.719 align:start position:0%
truth the student who hit the ball is a
 
01:08:51.669 --> 01:08:51.679 align:start position:0%
cisgender boy born a boy identifies as a
 
01:08:55.149 --> 01:08:55.159 align:start position:0%
boy has no question he is a boy the
 
01:08:56.630 --> 01:08:56.640 align:start position:0%
student student is not
 
01:08:59.030 --> 01:08:59.040 align:start position:0%
transgender pointing to that story as a
 
01:09:01.870 --> 01:09:01.880 align:start position:0%
reason to pass this bill is misleading
 
01:09:04.229 --> 01:09:04.239 align:start position:0%
that story has been misrepresented to
 
01:09:08.229 --> 01:09:08.239 align:start position:0%
Target transgender girls it is not true
 
01:09:11.110 --> 01:09:11.120 align:start position:0%
here's the reality anyone who has played
 
01:09:13.669 --> 01:09:13.679 align:start position:0%
Sports knows that injuries happen all of
 
01:09:16.829 --> 01:09:16.839 align:start position:0%
the time my son was a baseball pitcher
 
01:09:18.870 --> 01:09:18.880 align:start position:0%
in his time as a pitcher he threw a lot
 
01:09:21.990 --> 01:09:22.000 align:start position:0%
of strikes struck out a lot of batters
 
01:09:24.669 --> 01:09:24.679 align:start position:0%
he also threw a lot of balls walked
 
01:09:27.749 --> 01:09:27.759 align:start position:0%
batters and like every single pitcher in
 
01:09:30.910 --> 01:09:30.920 align:start position:0%
baseball and softball he has hit
 
01:09:33.709 --> 01:09:33.719 align:start position:0%
batters under no circumstances was he
 
01:09:36.510 --> 01:09:36.520 align:start position:0%
blamed for the injury nor was he ever
 
01:09:39.309 --> 01:09:39.319 align:start position:0%
the subject of intense media scrutiny or
 
01:09:41.430 --> 01:09:41.440 align:start position:0%
the target of harassment or attacks by
 
01:09:44.229 --> 01:09:44.239 align:start position:0%
peers coaches parents or the general
 
01:09:46.430 --> 01:09:46.440 align:start position:0%
public think back to when you played
 
01:09:49.349 --> 01:09:49.359 align:start position:0%
Sports you must have pulled calf muscles
 
01:09:52.990 --> 01:09:53.000 align:start position:0%
torn acl's jammed fingers or like me
 
01:09:56.669 --> 01:09:56.679 align:start position:0%
been hit by a baseball and a softball
 
01:09:58.910 --> 01:09:58.920 align:start position:0%
we should not blame any student athlete
 
01:10:01.750 --> 01:10:01.760 align:start position:0%
for an injury regardless of their
 
01:10:04.950 --> 01:10:04.960 align:start position:0%
gender we would also never have rules or
 
01:10:07.189 --> 01:10:07.199 align:start position:0%
pass laws that exclude students who are
 
01:10:09.070 --> 01:10:09.080 align:start position:0%
much taller than others from playing
 
01:10:10.709 --> 01:10:10.719 align:start position:0%
basketball because they have an
 
01:10:13.110 --> 01:10:13.120 align:start position:0%
advantage we wouldn't exclude students
 
01:10:14.910 --> 01:10:14.920 align:start position:0%
who are stronger than others from
 
01:10:16.750 --> 01:10:16.760 align:start position:0%
wrestling because they might pin their
 
01:10:19.950 --> 01:10:19.960 align:start position:0%
opponents in seconds we wouldn't exclude
 
01:10:21.990 --> 01:10:22.000 align:start position:0%
athletes who have longer wingspans like
 
01:10:24.870 --> 01:10:24.880 align:start position:0%
Michael Phelps from swimming we wouldn't
 
01:10:26.750 --> 01:10:26.760 align:start position:0%
exclude athletes who have played on
 
01:10:28.990 --> 01:10:29.000 align:start position:0%
private teams since they were little who
 
01:10:30.669 --> 01:10:30.679 align:start position:0%
might have more experience than their
 
01:10:34.229 --> 01:10:34.239 align:start position:0%
peers and are at an advantage this bill
 
01:10:36.189 --> 01:10:36.199 align:start position:0%
targets a small group of student
 
01:10:38.830 --> 01:10:38.840 align:start position:0%
athletes claiming there is a categorical
 
01:10:41.790 --> 01:10:41.800 align:start position:0%
Advantage when there is not and it comes
 
01:10:43.910 --> 01:10:43.920 align:start position:0%
with significant consequences for all

concern of some of my colleagues there
 
01:10:53.189 --> 01:10:53.199 align:start position:0%
have been zero transgender athletes in

01:11:24.310 --> 01:11:24.320 align:start position:0%

not be excluded harassed or targeted for

me after cross country practice and said
 
01:12:16.229 --> 01:12:16.239 align:start position:0%
mom there's a transgender on my team
 
01:12:18.709 --> 01:12:18.719 align:start position:0%
this isn't fair what can we
 
01:12:21.669 --> 01:12:21.679 align:start position:0%
do and I asked her if she wanted to make
 
01:12:24.310 --> 01:12:24.320 align:start position:0%
a federal case out of it because I was
 
01:12:25.990 --> 01:12:26.000 align:start position:0%
pretty sure that that's what it would
 
01:12:30.189 --> 01:12:30.199 align:start position:0%
take and just last week 16 female
 
01:12:33.270 --> 01:12:33.280 align:start position:0%
athletes filed a federal lawsuit against
 
01:12:35.189 --> 01:12:35.199 align:start position:0%

01:12:45.990 --> 01:12:46.000 align:start position:0%
others just like it across the
 
01:12:48.310 --> 01:12:48.320 align:start position:0%

among the first to adopt the policy

Sports we've even heard testimony from a
 
01:14:44.750 --> 01:14:44.760 align:start position:0%
colleague that it really didn't matter
 
01:14:46.830 --> 01:14:46.840 align:start position:0%
if a transgender athlete competed in
 
01:14:48.950 --> 01:14:48.960 align:start position:0%

are cut from
 
01:15:11.590 --> 01:15:11.600 align:start position:0%

01:15:13.669 --> 01:15:13.679 align:start position:0%

out their true authentic selves these

inquiry thank you Mr Speaker if I know
 
01:17:39.430 --> 01:17:39.440 align:start position:0%
that this bill has absolutely nothing to
 
01:17:43.669 --> 01:17:43.679 align:start position:0%
do with the NCAA Federal suit this only
 
01:17:47.070 --> 01:17:47.080 align:start position:0%
applies to New Hampshire students age 10
 
01:17:48.390 --> 01:17:48.400 align:start position:0%
to grades
 
01:17:50.870 --> 01:17:50.880 align:start position:0%
12 if I know that this bill also
 
01:17:52.910 --> 01:17:52.920 align:start position:0%
requires that those same students submit
 
01:17:55.510 --> 01:17:55.520 align:start position:0%
their birth certificate or undergo a
 
01:17:57.350 --> 01:17:57.360 align:start position:0%
personal investigation by school
 
01:17:59.669 --> 01:17:59.679 align:start position:0%
officials to prove what their body
 
01:18:01.790 --> 01:18:01.800 align:start position:0%
actually looks like to participate in
 
01:18:03.110 --> 01:18:03.120 align:start position:0%
any school
 
01:18:06.189 --> 01:18:06.199 align:start position:0%
Sport and if I know that hp25 would
 
01:18:09.110 --> 01:18:09.120 align:start position:0%
discriminate against a group of students
 
01:18:12.390 --> 01:18:12.400 align:start position:0%
in direct violation of T Title 9
 
01:18:14.189 --> 01:18:14.199 align:start position:0%
jeopardize school districts from being
 
01:18:16.550 --> 01:18:16.560 align:start position:0%
able to receive those federal funds
 
01:18:19.229 --> 01:18:19.239 align:start position:0%
which on the average is about $165
 
01:18:20.910 --> 01:18:20.920 align:start position:0%
million a
 
01:18:23.790 --> 01:18:23.800 align:start position:0%
year and finally if I know that all New
 
01:18:25.350 --> 01:18:25.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire students
 
01:18:29.229 --> 01:18:29.239 align:start position:0%
regardless of gender race sexual
 
01:18:34.229 --> 01:18:34.239 align:start position:0%
orientation sex religion economic status
 
01:18:36.510 --> 01:18:36.520 align:start position:0%
deserve the opportunity to learn those
 
01:18:40.390 --> 01:18:40.400 align:start position:0%
important life lessons in sports like
 
01:18:43.189 --> 01:18:43.199 align:start position:0%
leadership confidence
 
01:18:45.350 --> 01:18:45.360 align:start position:0%
self-respect what it means to be part of
 
01:18:48.750 --> 01:18:48.760 align:start position:0%
a team would I now press the red button
 
01:18:51.229 --> 01:18:51.239 align:start position:0%
so that another motion could be offered
 
01:18:53.270 --> 01:18:53.280 align:start position:0%

01:19:05.270 --> 01:19:05.280 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr Speaker if I know
 
01:19:07.590 --> 01:19:07.600 align:start position:0%
this bill protects the future of women's
 
01:19:10.669 --> 01:19:10.679 align:start position:0%
and girls Sports and will be the
 
01:19:14.830 --> 01:19:14.840 align:start position:0%
demise if we don't pass it of Title Nine
 
01:19:17.709 --> 01:19:17.719 align:start position:0%
if I know by permitting biological men
 
01:19:20.990 --> 01:19:21.000 align:start position:0%
who identify as girls to participate in
 
01:19:24.030 --> 01:19:24.040 align:start position:0%
women's girls Sports create creates both
 
01:19:24.040 --> 01:19:25.510 align:start position:0%
women's girls Sports create creates both
unfairness

01:19:25.510 --> 01:19:25.520 align:start position:0%
unfairness
 
01:19:28.709 --> 01:19:28.719 align:start position:0%
and severe safety
 
01:19:31.189 --> 01:19:31.199 align:start position:0%
issues and if I know that it is
 
01:19:34.830 --> 01:19:34.840 align:start position:0%
scientifically a fact that on average
 
01:19:39.310 --> 01:19:39.320 align:start position:0%
males are stronger faster and larger
 
01:19:41.030 --> 01:19:41.040 align:start position:0%
than average
 
01:19:44.910 --> 01:19:44.920 align:start position:0%
females and lastly if I also know by
 
01:19:47.550 --> 01:19:47.560 align:start position:0%
continuing to allow males who identify
 
01:19:50.510 --> 01:19:50.520 align:start position:0%
as girls or women to participate in
 
01:19:52.790 --> 01:19:52.800 align:start position:0%
women's Athletics it will lead to the
 
01:19:55.470 --> 01:19:55.480 align:start position:0%
end of girl Sports and and
 
01:19:58.750 --> 01:19:58.760 align:start position:0%
significantly reverse the gains women
 
01:20:01.310 --> 01:20:01.320 align:start position:0%

even among

agreement suggested by this resolution
 
01:40:15.470 --> 01:40:15.480 align:start position:0%

a climate

experienced by students today would only
 
01:40:37.870 --> 01:40:37.880 align:start position:0%
be worsened by the sort of Crisis
 
01:40:40.070 --> 01:40:40.080 align:start position:0%
mentality to be pushed by the

inquiry thank you Mr Speaker if I know
 
01:46:50.390 --> 01:46:50.400 align:start position:0%
that this bill was one of 10 bills that
 
01:46:54.709 --> 01:46:54.719 align:start position:0%
the bipartisan committee House Education
 
01:46:59.510 --> 01:46:59.520 align:start position:0%
moved to table if I know that on Friday
 
01:47:02.149 --> 01:47:02.159 align:start position:0%
there was a scathing report on the
 
01:47:05.310 --> 01:47:05.320 align:start position:0%
mismanagement of special education by
 
01:47:08.950 --> 01:47:08.960 align:start position:0%
the L LBA and it was issued on Friday we
 
01:47:11.910 --> 01:47:11.920 align:start position:0%
have not had a chance to look at it if I
 
01:47:14.589 --> 01:47:14.599 align:start position:0%
know that the chair of our committee
 
01:47:18.229 --> 01:47:18.239 align:start position:0%
chair lad has asked the LBA to come to
 
01:47:20.950 --> 01:47:20.960 align:start position:0%
our committee and explain this special
 
01:47:24.470 --> 01:47:24.480 align:start position:0%
education report and if I believe that
 
01:47:28.830 --> 01:47:28.840 align:start position:0%
this amendment is premature prior to
 
01:47:31.270 --> 01:47:31.280 align:start position:0%

bony thank you Mr
 
01:49:50.669 --> 01:49:50.679 align:start position:0%
Speaker HB 147 as amended would change
 
01:49:52.750 --> 01:49:52.760 align:start position:0%
the membership of the state advisory
 
01:49:54.709 --> 01:49:54.719 align:start position:0%
committee on the education of children
 
01:49:57.629 --> 01:49:57.639 align:start position:0%
with disabilities a federally mandated
 
01:49:59.950 --> 01:49:59.960 align:start position:0%
committee tasked with advising the
 
01:50:02.550 --> 01:50:02.560 align:start position:0%
Department of Education regarding unmet
 
01:50:05.229 --> 01:50:05.239 align:start position:0%
needs within the state in the education
 
01:50:06.629 --> 01:50:06.639 align:start position:0%
of children with
 
01:50:09.109 --> 01:50:09.119 align:start position:0%
disabilities I serve on that
 
01:50:12.310 --> 01:50:12.320 align:start position:0%
committee it is required by federal law
 
01:50:15.430 --> 01:50:15.440 align:start position:0%
to have a parent majority along with
 
01:50:17.550 --> 01:50:17.560 align:start position:0%
several members representing different
 
01:50:20.510 --> 01:50:20.520 align:start position:0%
professional educational roles for the
 
01:50:22.830 --> 01:50:22.840 align:start position:0%
past few years this committee has not
 
01:50:26.430 --> 01:50:26.440 align:start position:0%
been meeting its obligations of Duty or
 
01:50:29.430 --> 01:50:29.440 align:start position:0%
Quorum the education committee devoted
 
01:50:33.070 --> 01:50:33.080 align:start position:0%
much time and effort into study studying
 
01:50:35.229 --> 01:50:35.239 align:start position:0%
the retain bill in
 
01:50:38.390 --> 01:50:38.400 align:start position:0%
November we considered hours of
 
01:50:42.149 --> 01:50:42.159 align:start position:0%
conflicting input from testimony
 
01:50:46.709 --> 01:50:46.719 align:start position:0%
discussion phone calls and
 
01:50:49.069 --> 01:50:49.079 align:start position:0%
emails from all the
 
01:50:52.629 --> 01:50:52.639 align:start position:0%
parties there is no agreement among
 
01:50:55.069 --> 01:50:55.079 align:start position:0%
among the committee members themselves
 
01:50:57.750 --> 01:50:57.760 align:start position:0%
whether membership changes are
 
01:51:00.109 --> 01:51:00.119 align:start position:0%
necessary but there is universal
 
01:51:02.790 --> 01:51:02.800 align:start position:0%
agreement that obtaining a quorum for
 
01:51:05.270 --> 01:51:05.280 align:start position:0%
meetings is an ongoing
 
01:51:08.310 --> 01:51:08.320 align:start position:0%
problem everyone including the education
 
01:51:10.790 --> 01:51:10.800 align:start position:0%
committee members want to see a
 
01:51:13.950 --> 01:51:13.960 align:start position:0%

1272
 
01:51:26.870 --> 01:51:26.880 align:start position:0%

does not provide solutions to other
 
01:51:32.470 --> 01:51:32.480 align:start position:0%

01:52:01.430 --> 01:52:01.440 align:start position:0%
irregularities and non-compliance within

the
 
01:52:05.510 --> 01:52:05.520 align:start position:0%
department it would be premature to pass
 
01:52:07.790 --> 01:52:07.800 align:start position:0%
this bill without considering all
 
01:52:10.270 --> 01:52:10.280 align:start position:0%
deficiencies noted within the
 
01:52:14.430 --> 01:52:14.440 align:start position:0%

01:52:17.470 --> 01:52:17.480 align:start position:0%
legislation can address all identified
 
01:52:19.109 --> 01:52:19.119 align:start position:0%
issues and
 
01:52:22.510 --> 01:52:22.520 align:start position:0%
recommendations I urge you to vote no on
 
01:52:26.189 --> 01:52:26.199 align:start position:0%
on the otpa so that a new motion can be
 
01:52:31.750 --> 01:52:31.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:38.790 --> 01:52:38.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:40.990 --> 01:52:41.000 align:start position:0%
Noble thank you Mr
 
01:52:43.910 --> 01:52:43.920 align:start position:0%
Speaker the state advisory committee on
 
01:52:45.430 --> 01:52:45.440 align:start position:0%
the education of students with
 
01:52:47.629 --> 01:52:47.639 align:start position:0%
disabilities is a committee that is a
 
01:52:50.149 --> 01:52:50.159 align:start position:0%
federal requirement under
 
01:52:52.950 --> 01:52:52.960 align:start position:0%
idea the purpose of the committee is to
 
01:52:55.430 --> 01:52:55.440 align:start position:0%
advise the Department of Education on
 
01:52:58.229 --> 01:52:58.239 align:start position:0%
issues relating to special education and
 
01:53:01.470 --> 01:53:01.480 align:start position:0%
to promote communication and cooperation
 
01:53:03.870 --> 01:53:03.880 align:start position:0%
among individuals involved with students
 
01:53:03.880 --> 01:53:04.950 align:start position:0%
among individuals involved with students
with

01:53:04.950 --> 01:53:04.960 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:53:07.189 --> 01:53:07.199 align:start position:0%
disabilities the committee has grown
 
01:53:09.550 --> 01:53:09.560 align:start position:0%
quite a bit bigger than what is mandated
 
01:53:11.990 --> 01:53:12.000 align:start position:0%
by the federal government and each time
 
01:53:14.109 --> 01:53:14.119 align:start position:0%
you add someone you have to find more
 
01:53:17.149 --> 01:53:17.159 align:start position:0%
parents or individuals with disabilities
 
01:53:19.589 --> 01:53:19.599 align:start position:0%
because they must make up the majority
 
01:53:22.189 --> 01:53:22.199 align:start position:0%
of the committee this has caused the
 
01:53:25.629 --> 01:53:25.639 align:start position:0%
group to grow to about 47 people it
 
01:53:28.069 --> 01:53:28.079 align:start position:0%
became clear during the hearing that the
 
01:53:30.189 --> 01:53:30.199 align:start position:0%
committee has become largely
 
01:53:32.589 --> 01:53:32.599 align:start position:0%
dysfunctional and in the just released
 
01:53:35.589 --> 01:53:35.599 align:start position:0%
special education LBA audit the
 
01:53:37.350 --> 01:53:37.360 align:start position:0%
committee is having some trouble
 
01:53:40.030 --> 01:53:40.040 align:start position:0%
effectively performing their duties
 
01:53:42.669 --> 01:53:42.679 align:start position:0%
because of this the most logical
 
01:53:45.629 --> 01:53:45.639 align:start position:0%
solution at this time is to trim the
 
01:53:48.149 --> 01:53:48.159 align:start position:0%
committee down to the federally mandated
 
01:53:51.310 --> 01:53:51.320 align:start position:0%
membership which this amendment does but
 
01:53:53.229 --> 01:53:53.239 align:start position:0%
adds a position requested by the
 
01:53:55.189 --> 01:53:55.199 align:start position:0%
committee for a licensed health care
 
01:53:57.830 --> 01:53:57.840 align:start position:0%
provider who specializes in working with
 
01:54:00.470 --> 01:54:00.480 align:start position:0%
children and a non-voting state
 
01:54:02.350 --> 01:54:02.360 align:start position:0%
education official to serve in a
 
01:54:05.069 --> 01:54:05.079 align:start position:0%
technical support role this amendment
 
01:54:07.870 --> 01:54:07.880 align:start position:0%
replaces the bill and will be a big step
 
01:54:10.189 --> 01:54:10.199 align:start position:0%
in helping the committee to run more
 
01:54:13.069 --> 01:54:13.079 align:start position:0%
effectively and I urge you to support it
 
01:54:18.390 --> 01:54:18.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:21.149 --> 01:54:21.159 align:start position:0%
vote on the amendment the question is on
 
01:54:25.069 --> 01:54:25.079 align:start position:0%

inquiry thank you Mr thank you Mr
 
01:55:40.390 --> 01:55:40.400 align:start position:0%
Speaker uh if I know that the issue of
 
01:55:42.030 --> 01:55:42.040 align:start position:0%
special education out of the Department
 
01:55:45.109 --> 01:55:45.119 align:start position:0%
of Education is under full investigation
 
01:55:48.030 --> 01:55:48.040 align:start position:0%
by the LBA at this point in time and
 
01:55:50.030 --> 01:55:50.040 align:start position:0%
that the full report has not yet been
 
01:55:52.910 --> 01:55:52.920 align:start position:0%
issued if I know that if I believe that
 
01:55:55.390 --> 01:55:55.400 align:start position:0%
this amendment only deals with a very
 
01:55:58.430 --> 01:55:58.440 align:start position:0%
small section of special ed services to
 
01:56:02.109 --> 01:56:02.119 align:start position:0%
parents and if I believe that the the
 
01:56:03.709 --> 01:56:03.719 align:start position:0%
education committee should have an
 
01:56:07.189 --> 01:56:07.199 align:start position:0%
opportunity to review the current report
 
01:56:10.270 --> 01:56:10.280 align:start position:0%
that was just issued last Friday would I
 
01:56:12.470 --> 01:56:12.480 align:start position:0%
vot now vote no to allow the committee
 
01:56:14.629 --> 01:56:14.639 align:start position:0%

01:56:16.589 --> 01:56:16.599 align:start position:0%

01:56:37.589 --> 01:56:37.599 align:start position:0%
members and if I know that the committee
 
01:56:40.550 --> 01:56:40.560 align:start position:0%

election workers to deliver absentee

ballots to elder care facilities and
 
03:31:47.030 --> 03:31:47.040 align:start position:0%
that these workers already have a full

process is functioning well in virtually
 
03:31:54.510 --> 03:31:54.520 align:start position:0%

03:40:19.389 --> 03:40:19.399 align:start position:0%
by the WPA or the works progress
 
03:40:21.550 --> 03:40:21.560 align:start position:0%
administration each
 
03:40:23.990 --> 03:40:24.000 align:start position:0%
dollar invested by the county was
 
03:40:27.870 --> 03:40:27.880 align:start position:0%
matched by six federal funds the largest
 
03:40:31.389 --> 03:40:31.399 align:start position:0%
WPA project in the state at the
 
03:40:34.830 --> 03:40:34.840 align:start position:0%
time the project was completed in
 
03:40:37.590 --> 03:40:37.600 align:start position:0%
1937 and the area quickly became the
 
03:40:39.550 --> 03:40:39.560 align:start position:0%
mecca for skiing in New
 
03:40:42.630 --> 03:40:42.640 align:start position:0%
England at that time it was owned by
 
03:40:45.269 --> 03:40:45.279 align:start position:0%
belnap county and operated as an indep
 
03:40:48.950 --> 03:40:48.960 align:start position:0%
dependent Financial entity but in
 
03:40:51.510 --> 03:40:51.520 align:start position:0%
1959 all that
 
03:40:54.030 --> 03:40:54.040 align:start position:0%
changed we here in bellnap call it the
 
03:40:56.950 --> 03:40:56.960 align:start position:0%
enabling statue whereby it created the
 
03:41:00.229 --> 03:41:00.239 align:start position:0%
Gunstock area commission a board of five
 
03:41:03.590 --> 03:41:03.600 align:start position:0%
members serving five term fiveyear terms
 
03:41:06.309 --> 03:41:06.319 align:start position:0%
and this still exists
 
03:41:08.670 --> 03:41:08.680 align:start position:0%
today in
 
03:41:12.670 --> 03:41:12.680 align:start position:0%
1986 a huge expansion to revitalize
 
03:41:16.030 --> 03:41:16.040 align:start position:0%
Gunstock began and by the turn of the
 
03:41:19.030 --> 03:41:19.040 align:start position:0%
this Century the future of Gunstock was
 
03:41:19.040 --> 03:41:20.389 align:start position:0%
this Century the future of Gunstock was
in

03:41:20.389 --> 03:41:20.399 align:start position:0%
in
 
03:41:25.070 --> 03:41:25.080 align:start position:0%
doubt the cost ran to two 10.5 million
 
03:41:26.229 --> 03:41:26.239 align:start position:0%
with just
 
03:41:28.590 --> 03:41:28.600 align:start position:0%
65% of the work
 
03:41:31.710 --> 03:41:31.720 align:start position:0%
completed the options on the table at
 
03:41:34.670 --> 03:41:34.680 align:start position:0%
that time were to close the
 
03:41:37.269 --> 03:41:37.279 align:start position:0%
operations lease the mountain to a third
 
03:41:40.590 --> 03:41:40.600 align:start position:0%
party or keep the mountain
 
03:41:43.830 --> 03:41:43.840 align:start position:0%
open even if we lease the mountain
 
03:41:46.229 --> 03:41:46.239 align:start position:0%
belnap County tax pay payers would need
 
03:41:48.349 --> 03:41:48.359 align:start position:0%
to assume the
 
03:41:50.950 --> 03:41:50.960 align:start position:0%
debt between
 
03:41:52.990 --> 03:41:53.000 align:start position:0%
2001 and
 
03:41:56.590 --> 03:41:56.600 align:start position:0%
2010 when the debt was retired Gunstock
 
03:41:58.870 --> 03:41:58.880 align:start position:0%
paid $2.4
 
03:42:01.910 --> 03:42:01.920 align:start position:0%
million and the county taxpayers had
 
03:42:04.630 --> 03:42:04.640 align:start position:0%
paid $6.2
 
03:42:07.990 --> 03:42:08.000 align:start position:0%
million overall I am really glad that
 
03:42:10.550 --> 03:42:10.560 align:start position:0%
that decision was made because we and
 
03:42:13.229 --> 03:42:13.239 align:start position:0%
belnet County paid for that treasure and
 
03:42:16.590 --> 03:42:16.600 align:start position:0%
it is a treasure of our County
 
03:42:20.070 --> 03:42:20.080 align:start position:0%
so the question is who owns
 
03:42:23.429 --> 03:42:23.439 align:start position:0%
Gunstock according to chapter 399 it is
 
03:42:25.710 --> 03:42:25.720 align:start position:0%
owned by the county of bellnap and is
 
03:42:28.590 --> 03:42:28.600 align:start position:0%
incorporated as a body politic and as an
 
03:42:30.510 --> 03:42:30.520 align:start position:0%
agency of the county of
 
03:42:32.670 --> 03:42:32.680 align:start position:0%
bellnap I hope this clears up any
 
03:42:35.269 --> 03:42:35.279 align:start position:0%
questions regarding the ownership of the
 
03:42:37.510 --> 03:42:37.520 align:start position:0%
mountain now to some statements that
 
03:42:40.710 --> 03:42:40.720 align:start position:0%
have been made one claimed a forensic
 
03:42:42.630 --> 03:42:42.640 align:start position:0%
audit would be an unfunded
 
03:42:46.030 --> 03:42:46.040 align:start position:0%
mandate that is not true it would not
 
03:42:49.269 --> 03:42:49.279 align:start position:0%
affect the monies that go to bnap County
 
03:42:52.349 --> 03:42:52.359 align:start position:0%
it would just be a business expense to
 
03:42:55.189 --> 03:42:55.199 align:start position:0%
say that this expense will cost $50,000
 
03:42:58.670 --> 03:42:58.680 align:start position:0%
once every five years is also not true
 
03:43:00.870 --> 03:43:00.880 align:start position:0%
when I contacted a CPA firm that
 
03:43:02.990 --> 03:43:03.000 align:start position:0%
conducts forensic audits for
 
03:43:05.750 --> 03:43:05.760 align:start position:0%
governmental agencies they state it can
 
03:43:07.750 --> 03:43:07.760 align:start position:0%
cost as little as
 
03:43:10.309 --> 03:43:10.319 align:start position:0%
$5,000 it would only go up if they need
 
03:43:13.870 --> 03:43:13.880 align:start position:0%
to expand their search because initial
 
03:43:17.149 --> 03:43:17.159 align:start position:0%
inquire inquiries rais more
 
03:43:20.550 --> 03:43:20.560 align:start position:0%
questions even if $50,000 every five
 
03:43:25.389 --> 03:43:25.399 align:start position:0%
years that equates to $110,000 a year a
 
03:43:29.510 --> 03:43:29.520 align:start position:0%
small sum to assure a $20 million in
 
03:43:31.870 --> 03:43:31.880 align:start position:0%
annual gross income is being properly
 
03:43:31.880 --> 03:43:33.030 align:start position:0%
annual gross income is being properly
accounted

03:43:33.030 --> 03:43:33.040 align:start position:0%
accounted
 
03:43:36.510 --> 03:43:36.520 align:start position:0%
for if you think this is not political
 
03:43:39.710 --> 03:43:39.720 align:start position:0%
it really is I once spoke about having a
 
03:43:41.670 --> 03:43:41.680 align:start position:0%
forensic audit at the county level and
 
03:43:43.110 --> 03:43:43.120 align:start position:0%
you would have thought I accused someone
 
03:43:43.120 --> 03:43:44.030 align:start position:0%
you would have thought I accused someone
of

03:43:44.030 --> 03:43:44.040 align:start position:0%
of
 
03:43:46.870 --> 03:43:46.880 align:start position:0%
wrongdoing this is not the purpose of a
 
03:43:49.870 --> 03:43:49.880 align:start position:0%
forensic audit it is to assure the
 
03:43:52.790 --> 03:43:52.800 align:start position:0%
taxpayers that everything is above board
 
03:43:55.750 --> 03:43:55.760 align:start position:0%
and to keep honest people
 
03:43:58.030 --> 03:43:58.040 align:start position:0%
honest the next time we spoke about
 
03:43:59.750 --> 03:43:59.760 align:start position:0%
forming an audit committee at the county
 
03:44:03.269 --> 03:44:03.279 align:start position:0%
level and they preferred a forensic
 
03:44:06.710 --> 03:44:06.720 align:start position:0%
audit just like I'm asking for
 
03:44:09.710 --> 03:44:09.720 align:start position:0%
today so let's get to why a forensic
 
03:44:11.229 --> 03:44:11.239 align:start position:0%
audit is truly
 
03:44:13.510 --> 03:44:13.520 align:start position:0%
needed I was appointed to the audit
 
03:44:16.149 --> 03:44:16.159 align:start position:0%
Committee of Gunstock in June of
 
03:44:18.990 --> 03:44:19.000 align:start position:0%
2022 management was
 
03:44:22.389 --> 03:44:22.399 align:start position:0%
outraged simply at the idea of an audit
 
03:44:24.950 --> 03:44:24.960 align:start position:0%
committee the committee lasted for about
 
03:44:26.710 --> 03:44:26.720 align:start position:0%
four weeks before the other
 
03:44:27.790 --> 03:44:27.800 align:start position:0%
Commissioners along with General
 
03:44:30.189 --> 03:44:30.199 align:start position:0%
management coming back to work disbanded
 
03:44:34.950 --> 03:44:34.960 align:start position:0%
it just as quickly as it got started why
 
03:44:37.670 --> 03:44:37.680 align:start position:0%
they said that the over $20 million
 
03:44:40.910 --> 03:44:40.920 align:start position:0%
entity was too small to have an audit
 
03:44:43.229 --> 03:44:43.239 align:start position:0%
committee think about
 
03:44:45.990 --> 03:44:46.000 align:start position:0%
that no audit commit committee with
 
03:44:50.030 --> 03:44:50.040 align:start position:0%
Revenue in excess of $20 million
 
03:44:52.030 --> 03:44:52.040 align:start position:0%
annually as someone who has been
 
03:44:54.269 --> 03:44:54.279 align:start position:0%
involved in audits both here in the US
 
03:44:57.189 --> 03:44:57.199 align:start position:0%
and internationally both public and
 
03:44:59.550 --> 03:44:59.560 align:start position:0%
private I can tell you that the annual
 
03:45:02.429 --> 03:45:02.439 align:start position:0%
audit is limited to the information that
 
03:45:04.910 --> 03:45:04.920 align:start position:0%
the companies or entities provide and
 
03:45:07.870 --> 03:45:07.880 align:start position:0%
cannot assure that there is no fraud it
 
03:45:10.469 --> 03:45:10.479 align:start position:0%
actually says this in the audit report
 
03:45:13.030 --> 03:45:13.040 align:start position:0%
for Gunstock and I am going to quote the
 
03:45:16.389 --> 03:45:16.399 align:start position:0%
last line of the required supplementary
 
03:45:19.229 --> 03:45:19.239 align:start position:0%
in statement from the audit report of
 
03:45:19.239 --> 03:45:20.269 align:start position:0%
in statement from the audit report of
August

03:45:20.269 --> 03:45:20.279 align:start position:0%
August
 
03:45:25.149 --> 03:45:25.159 align:start position:0%
2023 we do not express an opinion or
 
03:45:28.670 --> 03:45:28.680 align:start position:0%
provide any Assurance on the information
 
03:45:31.070 --> 03:45:31.080 align:start position:0%
because the limited procedures do not
 
03:45:33.309 --> 03:45:33.319 align:start position:0%
provide us with sufficient evidence to
 
03:45:37.110 --> 03:45:37.120 align:start position:0%
express an opinion or provide any in
 
03:45:39.790 --> 03:45:39.800 align:start position:0%
assurance that is in the audit report
 
03:45:42.110 --> 03:45:42.120 align:start position:0%
that is open to the public that anybody
 
03:45:43.910 --> 03:45:43.920 align:start position:0%
can go and look
 
03:45:43.920 --> 03:45:46.189 align:start position:0%
can go and look
at

03:45:46.189 --> 03:45:46.199 align:start position:0%
at
 
03:45:48.870 --> 03:45:48.880 align:start position:0%
so what did I learn in this brief time
 
03:45:50.429 --> 03:45:50.439 align:start position:0%
on the audit
 
03:45:52.710 --> 03:45:52.720 align:start position:0%
committee I learned that the Gunstock
 
03:45:54.910 --> 03:45:54.920 align:start position:0%
checking account had to be closed and
 
03:45:57.229 --> 03:45:57.239 align:start position:0%
reopened under a new account number when
 
03:45:59.630 --> 03:45:59.640 align:start position:0%
the bank fortunately caught an attempt
 
03:46:03.670 --> 03:46:03.680 align:start position:0%
to fraudulently cash a check in almost
 
03:46:06.309 --> 03:46:06.319 align:start position:0%
$100,000 you would think that that
 
03:46:07.750 --> 03:46:07.760 align:start position:0%
incident would have been reported to the
 
03:46:09.950 --> 03:46:09.960 align:start position:0%
Gunstock Commissioners so that they
 
03:46:12.229 --> 03:46:12.239 align:start position:0%
could consider implementing additional
 
03:46:15.070 --> 03:46:15.080 align:start position:0%
security measures instead they were were
 
03:46:16.070 --> 03:46:16.080 align:start position:0%
kept in the
 
03:46:18.790 --> 03:46:18.800 align:start position:0%
dark the next issue concerned the
 
03:46:20.830 --> 03:46:20.840 align:start position:0%
general manager and CFO as they are the
 
03:46:24.269 --> 03:46:24.279 align:start position:0%
only signers of the checks with only one
 
03:46:27.790 --> 03:46:27.800 align:start position:0%
signature needed no matter the dollar
 
03:46:30.229 --> 03:46:30.239 align:start position:0%
amount the auditor had stated that he
 
03:46:31.790 --> 03:46:31.800 align:start position:0%
had asked for background information on
 
03:46:34.750 --> 03:46:34.760 align:start position:0%
the CFO his firm could not find anything
 
03:46:36.630 --> 03:46:36.640 align:start position:0%
on the internet when they did a search
 
03:46:36.640 --> 03:46:38.189 align:start position:0%
on the internet when they did a search
about

03:46:38.189 --> 03:46:38.199 align:start position:0%
about
 
03:46:42.590 --> 03:46:42.600 align:start position:0%
her what did they say and I quote she
 
03:46:46.309 --> 03:46:46.319 align:start position:0%
has the intelligence to both commit and
 
03:46:48.870 --> 03:46:48.880 align:start position:0%
conceal this statement is very
 
03:46:51.149 --> 03:46:51.159 align:start position:0%
disturbing they then went on to discuss
 
03:46:52.670 --> 03:46:52.680 align:start position:0%
that they regularly did not receive all
 
03:46:55.110 --> 03:46:55.120 align:start position:0%
the information asked for and that she
 
03:46:57.429 --> 03:46:57.439 align:start position:0%
was attempting to consolidate accounting
 
03:47:00.389 --> 03:47:00.399 align:start position:0%
functions to give her greater
 
03:47:02.750 --> 03:47:02.760 align:start position:0%
control the auditor summarized his
 
03:47:06.070 --> 03:47:06.080 align:start position:0%
concerns and I quote there is a reason
 
03:47:08.189 --> 03:47:08.199 align:start position:0%
why you want to slow down the transfer
 
03:47:08.199 --> 03:47:09.630 align:start position:0%
why you want to slow down the transfer
of

03:47:09.630 --> 03:47:09.640 align:start position:0%
of
 
03:47:13.309 --> 03:47:13.319 align:start position:0%
money again as I said a forensic audit
 
03:47:16.269 --> 03:47:16.279 align:start position:0%
keeps honest people honest
 
03:47:18.830 --> 03:47:18.840 align:start position:0%
for me the most disturbing information
 
03:47:21.349 --> 03:47:21.359 align:start position:0%
uncovered in my short time on the audit
 
03:47:23.550 --> 03:47:23.560 align:start position:0%
committee were three checks in the
 
03:47:27.229 --> 03:47:27.239 align:start position:0%
amount of $100 in consecutive order
 
03:47:29.590 --> 03:47:29.600 align:start position:0%
written on the same day that were made
 
03:47:33.229 --> 03:47:33.239 align:start position:0%
out to the Gunstock area commission it
 
03:47:34.790 --> 03:47:34.800 align:start position:0%
sounds like no big deal until we
 
03:47:37.349 --> 03:47:37.359 align:start position:0%
realized they were all drawn from One
 
03:47:41.030 --> 03:47:41.040 align:start position:0%
Bank cashed at another bank with no
 
03:47:43.830 --> 03:47:43.840 align:start position:0%
endorsement again I repeat no
 
03:47:46.990 --> 03:47:47.000 align:start position:0%
endorsement of of any kind and no

inquiry thank you Mr Mr Speaker Mr
 
04:02:47.149 --> 04:02:47.159 align:start position:0%
Speaker if I know this bill would
 
04:02:49.790 --> 04:02:49.800 align:start position:0%
Institute an overly complicated process
 
04:02:52.710 --> 04:02:52.720 align:start position:0%
in our traditionally non-partisan
 
04:02:55.030 --> 04:02:55.040 align:start position:0%
Community focused elections that are
 
04:02:57.030 --> 04:02:57.040 align:start position:0%
already challenging enough to find
 
04:02:58.990 --> 04:02:59.000 align:start position:0%
candidates willing to run in such a
 
04:03:02.309 --> 04:03:02.319 align:start position:0%
politically hostile time if I know this
 
04:03:04.790 --> 04:03:04.800 align:start position:0%
bill as amended is operationally
 
04:03:06.870 --> 04:03:06.880 align:start position:0%
unworkable particularly for school
 
04:03:09.710 --> 04:03:09.720 align:start position:0%
districts that comprise multiple towns
 
04:03:12.790 --> 04:03:12.800 align:start position:0%
introducing confusing terms and offices
 
04:03:14.910 --> 04:03:14.920 align:start position:0%
that do not otherwise exist in New
 
04:03:17.910 --> 04:03:17.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire election law and Mr Speaker if
 
04:03:19.550 --> 04:03:19.560 align:start position:0%
I know we have heard from our
 
04:03:23.990 --> 04:03:24.000 align:start position:0%
constituents that they are tired of
 
04:03:26.830 --> 04:03:26.840 align:start position:0%
hyperarid rhetoric seeping into our
 
04:03:30.550 --> 04:03:30.560 align:start position:0%
traditional nonpartisan local elections
 
04:03:32.870 --> 04:03:32.880 align:start position:0%
would I now press the red button so
 
04:03:35.429 --> 04:03:35.439 align:start position:0%

04:03:38.149 --> 04:03:38.159 align:start position:0%

parliamentary
 
04:03:42.189 --> 04:03:42.199 align:start position:0%
inquiry thank you Mr Speaker fellow
 
04:03:43.950 --> 04:03:43.960 align:start position:0%
Representatives if I know that this
 
04:03:46.870 --> 04:03:46.880 align:start position:0%
enabling legislation as amended would
 
04:03:48.630 --> 04:03:48.640 align:start position:0%
allow a school district to adopt a
 
04:03:50.830 --> 04:03:50.840 align:start position:0%
partisan ballot in their election but
 
04:03:53.030 --> 04:03:53.040 align:start position:0%
only if that school district chooses to
 
04:03:55.309 --> 04:03:55.319 align:start position:0%
do so and if I know that this
 
04:03:58.469 --> 04:03:58.479 align:start position:0%
legislation is strikingly similar to the
 
04:04:00.830 --> 04:04:00.840 align:start position:0%
enabling statute of RSA
 
04:04:03.510 --> 04:04:03.520 align:start position:0%
6692 which allows the option of partisan
 
04:04:06.309 --> 04:04:06.319 align:start position:0%
Town elections and if I know that having
 
04:04:09.070 --> 04:04:09.080 align:start position:0%
the candidates party affiliation readily
 
04:04:10.990 --> 04:04:11.000 align:start position:0%
available would help to inform the
 
04:04:13.790 --> 04:04:13.800 align:start position:0%
voters in that school district election
 
04:04:15.070 --> 04:04:15.080 align:start position:0%
and if I know that having more
 
04:04:16.910 --> 04:04:16.920 align:start position:0%
information about the candidates May
 
04:04:19.070 --> 04:04:19.080 align:start position:0%
dispel any lingering reluctance to
 
04:04:21.309 --> 04:04:21.319 align:start position:0%
participate and could actually increase
 
04:04:24.389 --> 04:04:24.399 align:start position:0%
voter interest in turnout and finally Mr
 
04:04:25.950 --> 04:04:25.960 align:start position:0%
Speaker if I know that a New Hampshire
 
04:04:28.269 --> 04:04:28.279 align:start position:0%
voter if that voter was familiar with a
 
04:04:30.750 --> 04:04:30.760 align:start position:0%
well-known song by Leslie Gore that upon
 
04:04:33.149 --> 04:04:33.159 align:start position:0%
seeing the candidates party affiliation
 
04:04:35.389 --> 04:04:35.399 align:start position:0%
so clearly listed in that ballot the
 
04:04:37.469 --> 04:04:37.479 align:start position:0%
voter th then might Rejoice at that
 
04:04:39.830 --> 04:04:39.840 align:start position:0%
recognition and cry out it's my party
 
04:04:41.990 --> 04:04:42.000 align:start position:0%
and I'll vote how I want to I'll vote
 
04:04:44.590 --> 04:04:44.600 align:start position:0%

04:10:52.590 --> 04:10:52.600 align:start position:0%
two absence from the town or
 
04:10:55.790 --> 04:10:55.800 align:start position:0%
city if I know that expanding the
 
04:10:58.149 --> 04:10:58.159 align:start position:0%
absentee voter affidavit to include
 
04:11:00.670 --> 04:11:00.680 align:start position:0%
absence because of snowstorms exceeds
 
04:11:03.070 --> 04:11:03.080 align:start position:0%
the authority of the Constitution and is
 
04:11:05.790 --> 04:11:05.800 align:start position:0%
therefore not permissive legislative
 
04:11:08.710 --> 04:11:08.720 align:start position:0%
judgment if I know that this very matter
 
04:11:10.510 --> 04:11:10.520 align:start position:0%
is currently awaiting adjudication in
 
04:11:12.830 --> 04:11:12.840 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Supreme Court and
 
04:11:15.710 --> 04:11:15.720 align:start position:0%
finally Mr Speaker if I know that the
 
04:11:18.229 --> 04:11:18.239 align:start position:0%
only proper way to make this change is
 
04:11:22.910 --> 04:11:22.920 align:start position:0%
by cacr would I now press the red
 
04:11:25.349 --> 04:11:25.359 align:start position:0%
button J recognize representative Lane
 
04:11:30.389 --> 04:11:30.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:33.870 --> 04:11:33.880 align:start position:0%
inquiry thank you Mr Speaker if I know
 
04:11:36.469 --> 04:11:36.479 align:start position:0%
that this bill amends an existing
 
04:11:39.189 --> 04:11:39.199 align:start position:0%
statute that was passed in
 
04:11:42.070 --> 04:11:42.080 align:start position:0%
2018 uh to address a situation where
 
04:11:44.790 --> 04:11:44.800 align:start position:0%
many Town moderator ERS cancelled
 
04:11:47.990 --> 04:11:48.000 align:start position:0%
elections due to a severe winter storm
 
04:11:51.349 --> 04:11:51.359 align:start position:0%
which created a great curfuffle between
 
04:11:54.229 --> 04:11:54.239 align:start position:0%
the towns and the Secretary of State and
 
04:11:56.870 --> 04:11:56.880 align:start position:0%
if I know that the existing statute was
 
04:12:01.309 --> 04:12:01.319 align:start position:0%
worked as a bar bipartisan effort and if
 
04:12:03.750 --> 04:12:03.760 align:start position:0%
I know that the bill only applies when
 
04:12:07.429 --> 04:12:07.439 align:start position:0%
there's a snowstorm on town meeting day
 
04:12:09.550 --> 04:12:09.560 align:start position:0%
and if I know that this bill does not
 
04:12:12.590 --> 04:12:12.600 align:start position:0%
change any substantive portions of the
 
04:12:15.389 --> 04:12:15.399 align:start position:0%
bill all it does is simplify the form
 
04:12:18.229 --> 04:12:18.239 align:start position:0%
that is called for by the bill and if I
 
04:12:21.149 --> 04:12:21.159 align:start position:0%
know that if the case discussed by my
 
04:12:23.550 --> 04:12:23.560 align:start position:0%
colleague from wendham is decided for
 
04:12:26.750 --> 04:12:26.760 align:start position:0%
the plff then it will override the
 
04:12:29.429 --> 04:12:29.439 align:start position:0%
statute regardless of what happens here
 
04:12:32.389 --> 04:12:32.399 align:start position:0%
today then would I press the green
 
04:12:36.149 --> 04:12:36.159 align:start position:0%

04:16:34.550 --> 04:16:34.560 align:start position:0%
inquiry thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker
 
04:16:36.070 --> 04:16:36.080 align:start position:0%
if I know that when the New Hampshire
 
04:16:38.309 --> 04:16:38.319 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court struck down our the
 
04:16:41.469 --> 04:16:41.479 align:start position:0%
legislative body's campaign Finance law
 
04:16:43.830 --> 04:16:43.840 align:start position:0%
that they left us in a situ ation where
 
04:16:46.309 --> 04:16:46.319 align:start position:0%
we inadvertently treat corporations and
 
04:16:49.630 --> 04:16:49.640 align:start position:0%
unions differently in campaign finance
 
04:16:51.389 --> 04:16:51.399 align:start position:0%
and if I know that the Supreme Court
 
04:16:53.550 --> 04:16:53.560 align:start position:0%
when they struck down that law gave us
 
04:16:55.990 --> 04:16:56.000 align:start position:0%
very explicit instructions on how to
 
04:16:58.550 --> 04:16:58.560 align:start position:0%
remedy the situation by applying the
 
04:17:00.790 --> 04:17:00.800 align:start position:0%
same language to both unions and
 
04:17:03.710 --> 04:17:03.720 align:start position:0%
corporations equally and if I know that
 
04:17:05.630 --> 04:17:05.640 align:start position:0%
this bill does exactly what the New
 
04:17:07.790 --> 04:17:07.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Supreme Court instructed us to
 
04:17:10.309 --> 04:17:10.319 align:start position:0%
do by applying the same language to both
 
04:17:12.950 --> 04:17:12.960 align:start position:0%
unions and corporations so that we
 
04:17:15.510 --> 04:17:15.520 align:start position:0%
fulfill the original intent of our 19177
 
04:17:17.870 --> 04:17:17.880 align:start position:0%
campaign Finance law then Mr Speaker
 
04:17:19.830 --> 04:17:19.840 align:start position:0%
would I now press the red button against
 
04:17:21.590 --> 04:17:21.600 align:start position:0%
indefinite postponement so that we can
 
04:17:24.109 --> 04:17:24.119 align:start position:0%
fulfill our duty and create an even
 
04:17:24.119 --> 04:17:30.910 align:start position:0%
fulfill our duty and create an even
playing

04:17:30.910 --> 04:17:30.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:33.070 --> 04:17:33.080 align:start position:0%
field here recognized representative
 
04:17:36.109 --> 04:17:36.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:39.630 --> 04:17:39.640 align:start position:0%
inquiry thank you Mr thank you Mr
 
04:17:42.429 --> 04:17:42.439 align:start position:0%
Speaker Mr Speaker if I know that this
 
04:17:45.269 --> 04:17:45.279 align:start position:0%
bill extends the current restriction on
 
04:17:48.349 --> 04:17:48.359 align:start position:0%
political donations by labor unions to
 
04:17:50.550 --> 04:17:50.560 align:start position:0%
all business organizations and this
 
04:17:53.870 --> 04:17:53.880 align:start position:0%
restriction is partly due because of the
 
04:17:56.950 --> 04:17:56.960 align:start position:0%
forced um workers joining unions and
 
04:18:00.910 --> 04:18:00.920 align:start position:0%
paying dues a situation that does not
 
04:18:03.750 --> 04:18:03.760 align:start position:0%
stand for corporations and makes them on
 
04:18:05.349 --> 04:18:05.359 align:start position:0%
a different playing field when it comes
 
04:18:07.750 --> 04:18:07.760 align:start position:0%
to collecting money and finally Mr
 
04:18:11.590 --> 04:18:11.600 align:start position:0%
Speaker if I am concerned that this
 
04:18:14.710 --> 04:18:14.720 align:start position:0%
would make it more difficult for a small
 
04:18:17.910 --> 04:18:17.920 align:start position:0%
business corporation that is the
 
04:18:20.070 --> 04:18:20.080 align:start position:0%

underlying bill and if I know that the
 
04:29:59.870 --> 04:29:59.880 align:start position:0%
underlying bill is unnecessary and
 
04:30:02.630 --> 04:30:02.640 align:start position:0%
confusing and if I know there's already
 
04:30:04.590 --> 04:30:04.600 align:start position:0%
enough that we have laid at the on the
 
04:30:08.109 --> 04:30:08.119 align:start position:0%

recently approved by the governor and
 
04:30:34.590 --> 04:30:34.600 align:start position:0%

accountability and if I know absente
 
04:30:49.389 --> 04:30:49.399 align:start position:0%
ballot accountability is nothing more
 
04:30:52.269 --> 04:30:52.279 align:start position:0%
than a good business practice of
 
04:30:55.630 --> 04:30:55.640 align:start position:0%
inventory accountability which is simply
 
04:30:58.189 --> 04:30:58.199 align:start position:0%
know knowing the number of absentee
 
04:31:01.389 --> 04:31:01.399 align:start position:0%
ballots that you start with and the
 
04:31:03.870 --> 04:31:03.880 align:start position:0%
number of absentee ballots that you have
 
04:31:06.950 --> 04:31:06.960 align:start position:0%

04:32:36.750 --> 04:32:36.760 align:start position:0%
fails the question is now on ought to
 
04:32:39.870 --> 04:32:39.880 align:start position:0%
pass is also a division vote as a
 
04:32:45.229 --> 04:32:45.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:47.590 --> 04:32:47.600 align:start position:0%
Pro we will proceed with the division
 
04:32:50.429 --> 04:32:50.439 align:start position:0%
vote right now representative Hamlet
 
04:32:54.109 --> 04:32:54.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:56.990 --> 04:32:57.000 align:start position:0%
inquiry thank you Mr
 
04:33:00.229 --> 04:33:00.239 align:start position:0%
Speaker Mr Speaker if I know that the
 
04:33:02.229 --> 04:33:02.239 align:start position:0%
supervisors of the checklists in the
 
04:33:05.150 --> 04:33:05.160 align:start position:0%
cities and towns keep accurate and
 
04:33:07.590 --> 04:33:07.600 align:start position:0%
retrievable records of the absentee
 
04:33:11.070 --> 04:33:11.080 align:start position:0%
ballot inventory in election net and if
 
04:33:13.390 --> 04:33:13.400 align:start position:0%
I know that adding the absentee ballot
 
04:33:15.830 --> 04:33:15.840 align:start position:0%
inventory to the pre-election
 
04:33:17.949 --> 04:33:17.959 align:start position:0%
certificate would conflict with the
 
04:33:21.150 --> 04:33:21.160 align:start position:0%
purpose of that certificate and cause
 
04:33:24.310 --> 04:33:24.320 align:start position:0%
confusion and if I know there would be a
 
04:33:26.830 --> 04:33:26.840 align:start position:0%
better way to report the absentee ballot
 
04:33:29.629 --> 04:33:29.639 align:start position:0%
inventory to a voter who wants to see
 
04:33:31.510 --> 04:33:31.520 align:start position:0%
the whole inventory process from
 
04:33:35.551 --> 04:33:35.561 align:start position:0%
beginning to end and if I know that this
 
04:33:38.949 --> 04:33:38.959 align:start position:0%
bill would also add the absentee ballot
 
04:33:41.830 --> 04:33:41.840 align:start position:0%
inventory to the Post elction certific
 
04:33:44.629 --> 04:33:44.639 align:start position:0%
ific which was formerly the moderator
 
04:33:46.869 --> 04:33:46.879 align:start position:0%
certificate that was recently renamed by
 
04:33:49.590 --> 04:33:49.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:54.029 --> 04:33:54.039 align:start position:0%
154 um so which would make the post
 
04:33:56.310 --> 04:33:56.320 align:start position:0%
elction certificate even more
 
04:33:59.789 --> 04:33:59.799 align:start position:0%
complicated than it already is would I
 
04:34:02.189 --> 04:34:02.199 align:start position:0%
then press the red button to defeat this
 
04:34:05.070 --> 04:34:05.080 align:start position:0%
a to pass as amended motion ought to
 
04:34:09.029 --> 04:34:09.039 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:10.949 --> 04:34:10.959 align:start position:0%
Speaker representative Burnham's
 
04:34:14.750 --> 04:34:14.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:20.070 --> 04:34:20.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:22.830 --> 04:34:22.840 align:start position:0%
colleagues if I know that the recently
 
04:34:25.189 --> 04:34:25.199 align:start position:0%
approved legislation now keeps better
 
04:34:28.670 --> 04:34:28.680 align:start position:0%
track of the election day ballots and
 
04:34:31.750 --> 04:34:31.760 align:start position:0%
and this bill would allow New Hampshire
 
04:34:33.990 --> 04:34:34.000 align:start position:0%
to keep a better track of absentee
 
04:34:36.470 --> 04:34:36.480 align:start position:0%
ballots at the same level of
 
04:34:39.750 --> 04:34:39.760 align:start position:0%
accountability as election day ballots
 
04:34:42.830 --> 04:34:42.840 align:start position:0%
and if I know that business is whether a
 
04:34:45.830 --> 04:34:45.840 align:start position:0%
corporate giant or a local mom and pop
 
04:34:48.390 --> 04:34:48.400 align:start position:0%
store must know all their inventory to
 
04:34:51.789 --> 04:34:51.799 align:start position:0%
stay in business and if I know that good
 
04:34:55.029 --> 04:34:55.039 align:start position:0%
business sense and Common Sense tells us
 
04:34:58.510 --> 04:34:58.520 align:start position:0%
to keep track of all inventory not just
 
04:35:01.590 --> 04:35:01.600 align:start position:0%
some of it and if I know that absentee
 
04:35:04.510 --> 04:35:04.520 align:start position:0%
ballot accountability is applying good
 
04:35:08.109 --> 04:35:08.119 align:start position:0%
business sense of inventory control to
 
04:35:09.709 --> 04:35:09.719 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
04:35:12.189 --> 04:35:12.199 align:start position:0%
elections and if I know
 
04:35:14.230 --> 04:35:14.240 align:start position:0%
that better ballot accountability means
 
04:35:15.869 --> 04:35:15.879 align:start position:0%
better election
 
04:35:18.230 --> 04:35:18.240 align:start position:0%
transparency and better election
 
04:35:20.629 --> 04:35:20.639 align:start position:0%
transparency means higher voter
 
04:35:25.390 --> 04:35:25.400 align:start position:0%
confidence and election Integrity in New
 
04:35:28.510 --> 04:35:28.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire then I would press the green
 
04:35:33.109 --> 04:35:33.119 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr Speaker good afternoon
 
04:37:54.949 --> 04:37:54.959 align:start position:0%
colleagues rodents no matter how cute
 
04:37:57.109 --> 04:37:57.119 align:start position:0%
you think they are they're a public
 
04:38:00.189 --> 04:38:00.199 align:start position:0%
health issue did you know that rodent
 
04:38:03.709 --> 04:38:03.719 align:start position:0%
spread disease diseases that can be
 
04:38:06.189 --> 04:38:06.199 align:start position:0%
spread to people directly or indirectly
 
04:38:06.199 --> 04:38:07.349 align:start position:0%
spread to people directly or indirectly
from

04:38:07.349 --> 04:38:07.359 align:start position:0%
from
 
04:38:10.429 --> 04:38:10.439 align:start position:0%
them they can actually spread over 200
 
04:38:10.439 --> 04:38:13.189 align:start position:0%
them they can actually spread over 200
diseases

04:38:13.189 --> 04:38:13.199 align:start position:0%
diseases
 
04:38:15.709 --> 04:38:15.719 align:start position:0%
indirect spread of disease can be when a
 
04:38:19.949 --> 04:38:19.959 align:start position:0%
flea mosquito might or tick feed on an
 
04:38:19.959 --> 04:38:20.910 align:start position:0%
flea mosquito might or tick feed on an
infected

04:38:20.910 --> 04:38:20.920 align:start position:0%
infected
 
04:38:23.470 --> 04:38:23.480 align:start position:0%
rodent and I know that we don't have any
 
04:38:25.990 --> 04:38:26.000 align:start position:0%
mosquitoes or ticks in New Hampshire or
 
04:38:28.670 --> 04:38:28.680 align:start position:0%
should I say which one do we have more
 
04:38:31.390 --> 04:38:31.400 align:start position:0%
of yes the member will suspend for a
 
04:38:34.349 --> 04:38:34.359 align:start position:0%
minute I know um all of you seem to have
 
04:38:36.230 --> 04:38:36.240 align:start position:0%
some place to go and that's fine but if
 
04:38:37.910 --> 04:38:37.920 align:start position:0%
you could get there quietly that would
 
04:38:40.429 --> 04:38:40.439 align:start position:0%
be more respectful to the person
 
04:38:44.349 --> 04:38:44.359 align:start position:0%
speaking continue thank you uh yes we
 
04:38:46.510 --> 04:38:46.520 align:start position:0%
can use Bay traps but if you have ever
 
04:38:48.949 --> 04:38:48.959 align:start position:0%
had a decomposing rodent carcass in your
 
04:38:52.310 --> 04:38:52.320 align:start position:0%
walls the odor is not only offensive it
 
04:38:54.750 --> 04:38:54.760 align:start position:0%
could also be associated with bacteria
 
04:38:56.349 --> 04:38:56.359 align:start position:0%
and something as dangerous as a
 
04:39:00.670 --> 04:39:00.680 align:start position:0%
potentially H antivirus and I say deadly
 
04:39:02.750 --> 04:39:02.760 align:start position:0%
between 1993 and
 
04:39:05.830 --> 04:39:05.840 align:start position:0%
2021 we had one person actually die here
 
04:39:08.230 --> 04:39:08.240 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire from the virus and
 
04:39:09.590 --> 04:39:09.600 align:start position:0%
there are many other health issues that
 
04:39:12.349 --> 04:39:12.359 align:start position:0%
may go undos undiagnosed from rodent
 
04:39:15.910 --> 04:39:15.920 align:start position:0%
diseases in truth we need all the tools
 
04:39:18.510 --> 04:39:18.520 align:start position:0%
to com combat infestations of rodents in
 
04:39:22.269 --> 04:39:22.279 align:start position:0%
our homes barns stores factories
 
04:39:26.510 --> 04:39:26.520 align:start position:0%
Etc one female Mouse can have as many as
 
04:39:32.230 --> 04:39:32.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:35.990 --> 04:39:36.000 align:start position:0%
year that is just one female Mouse think
 
04:39:38.150 --> 04:39:38.160 align:start position:0%
about that you will need to compound
 
04:39:40.310 --> 04:39:40.320 align:start position:0%
that effect for every female Mouse in
 
04:39:45.830 --> 04:39:45.840 align:start position:0%
that litter breeding every 19 to 21 days
 
04:39:47.948 --> 04:39:47.958 align:start position:0%
they be can become pregnant at four
 
04:39:51.550 --> 04:39:51.560 align:start position:0%
weeks of age and a house mouse can live
 
04:39:53.150 --> 04:39:53.160 align:start position:0%
up to two
 
04:39:56.470 --> 04:39:56.480 align:start position:0%
years we do not need to study this issue
 
04:39:58.670 --> 04:39:58.680 align:start position:0%
we need to have all the tools available
 
04:40:02.070 --> 04:40:02.080 align:start position:0%
to us these adhesive traps will not work
 
04:40:05.350 --> 04:40:05.360 align:start position:0%
outside when dirt or dust get on the
 
04:40:07.670 --> 04:40:07.680 align:start position:0%
adhesive and as a matter of fact I don't
 
04:40:10.470 --> 04:40:10.480 align:start position:0%
know of anyone who uses them outside
 
04:40:12.708 --> 04:40:12.718 align:start position:0%
without having a shelter shelter over
 
04:40:15.510 --> 04:40:15.520 align:start position:0%
them and since I have
 
04:40:18.708 --> 04:40:18.718 align:start position:0%
dogs I have concerns about my animals
 
04:40:21.070 --> 04:40:21.080 align:start position:0%
ingesting erodents who die because of
 
04:40:25.190 --> 04:40:25.200 align:start position:0%
the bait if this occurs my dogs could
 
04:40:27.310 --> 04:40:27.320 align:start position:0%
become very seriously
 
04:40:30.590 --> 04:40:30.600 align:start position:0%
ill in conclusion I believe it is
 
04:40:33.590 --> 04:40:33.600 align:start position:0%
sensible to let the market dictate what
 
04:40:33.600 --> 04:40:34.430 align:start position:0%
sensible to let the market dictate what
is

04:40:34.430 --> 04:40:34.440 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:40:37.190 --> 04:40:37.200 align:start position:0%
necessary as this truly is a public
 
04:40:37.200 --> 04:40:39.230 align:start position:0%
necessary as this truly is a public

04:40:48.788 --> 04:40:48.798 align:start position:0%
report thank you Mr Speaker the
 
04:40:51.350 --> 04:40:51.360 align:start position:0%
environment and agriculture committee
 
04:40:55.430 --> 04:40:55.440 align:start position:0%
heard testimony on this bill to prohibit
 
04:40:59.270 --> 04:40:59.280 align:start position:0%
adhesive based traps commonly called
 
04:40:59.280 --> 04:41:00.510 align:start position:0%
adhesive based traps commonly called
glue

04:41:00.510 --> 04:41:00.520 align:start position:0%
glue
 
04:41:03.590 --> 04:41:03.600 align:start position:0%
traps from those who use them for rodent
 
04:41:07.190 --> 04:41:07.200 align:start position:0%
removal and those who oppose them

options outside of glue traps that

order thank you very much Mr
 
04:49:30.150 --> 04:49:30.160 align:start position:0%
Speaker if I know that the creation of
 
04:49:31.990 --> 04:49:32.000 align:start position:0%
the Columbus Day holiday which wasn't
 
04:49:34.910 --> 04:49:34.920 align:start position:0%
officially established in 1968 may have
 
04:49:36.510 --> 04:49:36.520 align:start position:0%
made some sense in
 
04:49:39.030 --> 04:49:39.040 align:start position:0%
1968 but if I also know they given what
 
04:49:41.590 --> 04:49:41.600 align:start position:0%
we know about Columbus now in
 
04:49:44.070 --> 04:49:44.080 align:start position:0%
24 um he's not an appropriate person the
 
04:49:45.990 --> 04:49:46.000 align:start position:0%
name of holiday after and I mean no dis
 
04:49:48.708 --> 04:49:48.718 align:start position:0%
disrespect to either the Italian people
 
04:49:50.510 --> 04:49:50.520 align:start position:0%
or the Spanish people both of whom
 
04:49:53.270 --> 04:49:53.280 align:start position:0%
consider them one of theirs and if I
 
04:49:56.990 --> 04:49:57.000 align:start position:0%
also know that the that when it was
 
04:49:59.030 --> 04:49:59.040 align:start position:0%
established part of it was the
 
04:50:01.350 --> 04:50:01.360 align:start position:0%
uh was ATT tribute to the idea of
 
04:50:03.230 --> 04:50:03.240 align:start position:0%
Discovery but Columbus didn't really
 
04:50:04.670 --> 04:50:04.680 align:start position:0%
discover anything there were millions of
 
04:50:06.230 --> 04:50:06.240 align:start position:0%
people already Living in
 
04:50:08.470 --> 04:50:08.480 align:start position:0%
America when he came over here though
 
04:50:09.750 --> 04:50:09.760 align:start position:0%
not to anything is now part of the
 
04:50:13.190 --> 04:50:13.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:15.510 --> 04:50:15.520 align:start position:0%
so if I know that he didn't discover
 
04:50:17.548 --> 04:50:17.558 align:start position:0%
America anyway he was not even the first
 
04:50:21.390 --> 04:50:21.400 align:start position:0%

agree with the majority Report with the

report thank you Mr
 
04:53:39.708 --> 04:53:39.718 align:start position:0%
chair oh Mi Mr Speaker I do apologize my
 
04:53:42.470 --> 04:53:42.480 align:start position:0%
mind is somewhere else today obviously
 
04:53:47.190 --> 04:53:47.200 align:start position:0%
um but my sincerest apologies Mr Speaker
 
04:53:50.070 --> 04:53:50.080 align:start position:0%
um anyways uh I Rise before you to
 
04:53:52.590 --> 04:53:52.600 align:start position:0%
overturn the itl um there is a floor
 
04:53:54.430 --> 04:53:54.440 align:start position:0%
amendment that addresses one of the
 
04:53:57.470 --> 04:53:57.480 align:start position:0%
issues in the bill about uh the Spalding
 
04:54:01.110 --> 04:54:01.120 align:start position:0%
Turnpike um and what this Bill is saying
 
04:54:03.390 --> 04:54:03.400 align:start position:0%
is that state
 
04:54:06.948 --> 04:54:06.958 align:start position:0%
agencies contractors subcontractors must
 
04:54:11.190 --> 04:54:11.200 align:start position:0%
accept cash at all transaction
 
04:54:15.270 --> 04:54:15.280 align:start position:0%
points that includes the toll
 
04:54:18.190 --> 04:54:18.200 align:start position:0%
system and I think it's
 
04:54:21.670 --> 04:54:21.680 align:start position:0%
important we have citizens in this state
 
04:54:24.150 --> 04:54:24.160 align:start position:0%
that travel our roadways that cannot
 
04:54:25.190 --> 04:54:25.200 align:start position:0%
afford a
 
04:54:27.190 --> 04:54:27.200 align:start position:0%
transponder and
 
04:54:31.628 --> 04:54:31.638 align:start position:0%
need the cash Lane to go
 
04:54:34.190 --> 04:54:34.200 align:start position:0%
through um when we
 
04:54:37.270 --> 04:54:37.280 align:start position:0%
force citizens to have to have this
 
04:54:39.750 --> 04:54:39.760 align:start position:0%
transponder we are alienating a good
 
04:54:41.590 --> 04:54:41.600 align:start position:0%
portion of our our
 
04:54:44.590 --> 04:54:44.600 align:start position:0%
population and unfortunately with the
 
04:54:46.990 --> 04:54:47.000 align:start position:0%
Easy Pass uh transponder you have to
 
04:54:50.270 --> 04:54:50.280 align:start position:0%
keep a minimum balance which really
 
04:54:52.910 --> 04:54:52.920 align:start position:0%
harms some of the people in New
 
04:54:55.310 --> 04:54:55.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so I would ask that you
 
04:54:57.310 --> 04:54:57.320 align:start position:0%
overturn the itl so that the floor
 
04:54:59.670 --> 04:54:59.680 align:start position:0%
Amendment could be brought thank
 
04:55:02.270 --> 04:55:02.280 align:start position:0%
you representative mcart is recognized
 
04:55:09.310 --> 04:55:09.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:09.320 --> 04:55:13.510 align:start position:0%
 
report

04:55:13.510 --> 04:55:13.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:17.310 --> 04:55:17.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:27.868 --> 04:55:27.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:32.990 --> 04:55:33.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:35.548 --> 04:55:35.558 align:start position:0%
okay how about representative groda you
 
04:55:39.230 --> 04:55:39.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:39.240 --> 04:55:43.350 align:start position:0%
 
go

04:55:43.350 --> 04:55:43.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:46.110 --> 04:55:46.120 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Mr
 
04:55:49.110 --> 04:55:49.120 align:start position:0%
Speaker when the committee received this
 
04:55:50.670 --> 04:55:50.680 align:start position:0%
bill and during the hearing we
 
04:55:53.030 --> 04:55:53.040 align:start position:0%
considered it a serious
 
04:55:57.868 --> 04:55:57.878 align:start position:0%
matter because indeed not everyone has
 
04:56:00.670 --> 04:56:00.680 align:start position:0%
access to a credit card not everyone has
 
04:56:02.868 --> 04:56:02.878 align:start position:0%
the cash available for that or checking
 
04:56:02.878 --> 04:56:06.030 align:start position:0%
the cash available for that or checking
account

04:56:06.030 --> 04:56:06.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:08.948 --> 04:56:08.958 align:start position:0%
so one of the committee members the one
 
04:56:11.390 --> 04:56:11.400 align:start position:0%
who's speaking now called the
 
04:56:12.868 --> 04:56:12.878 align:start position:0%
commissioner of the Department of
 
04:56:16.230 --> 04:56:16.240 align:start position:0%
administrative services and asked what
 
04:56:19.470 --> 04:56:19.480 align:start position:0%
state agency does not accept cash
 
04:56:22.670 --> 04:56:22.680 align:start position:0%
because we have a bill here
 
04:56:22.680 --> 04:56:25.628 align:start position:0%
because we have a bill here
that

04:56:25.628 --> 04:56:25.638 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:56:28.750 --> 04:56:28.760 align:start position:0%
will mandate that state agencies take
 
04:56:33.270 --> 04:56:33.280 align:start position:0%
cash and their answer was that cash is a
 
04:56:36.310 --> 04:56:36.320 align:start position:0%
way of transacting business in the state
 
04:56:39.310 --> 04:56:39.320 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire in all agencies if you
 
04:56:41.070 --> 04:56:41.080 align:start position:0%
go to the Department of Motor Vehicles
 
04:56:43.150 --> 04:56:43.160 align:start position:0%
you can pay for your driver's license
 
04:56:48.830 --> 04:56:48.840 align:start position:0%
with cash even if you want to um go to
 
04:56:50.628 --> 04:56:50.638 align:start position:0%
the tool booth and you don't have the
 
04:56:52.750 --> 04:56:52.760 align:start position:0%
cash you can get a non-traceable
 
04:56:55.390 --> 04:56:55.400 align:start position:0%
transponder and pay for that transponder
 
04:56:58.708 --> 04:56:58.718 align:start position:0%
with cash so I hope that you will
 
04:57:01.310 --> 04:57:01.320 align:start position:0%
consider the committee's recommendation
 
04:57:02.990 --> 04:57:03.000 align:start position:0%
to support
 
04:57:05.670 --> 04:57:05.680 align:start position:0%
itl and recognize that this is a
 
04:57:08.030 --> 04:57:08.040 align:start position:0%
difficult situation for many in for some
 
04:57:20.350 --> 04:57:20.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:23.190 --> 04:57:23.200 align:start position:0%
okay and I ask for division
 
04:57:25.548 --> 04:57:25.558 align:start position:0%
vote the questions on the majority
 
04:57:27.030 --> 04:57:27.040 align:start position:0%
committee report of in expedient to
 
04:57:28.590 --> 04:57:28.600 align:start position:0%
legislate and this will be a division
 
04:57:39.110 --> 04:57:39.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:39.120 --> 04:58:09.110 align:start position:0%
 
seats

04:58:09.110 --> 04:58:09.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:09.120 --> 04:58:26.628 align:start position:0%
 
e

04:58:26.628 --> 04:58:26.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:27.948 --> 04:58:27.958 align:start position:0%
questions on the majority committee
 
04:58:29.590 --> 04:58:29.600 align:start position:0%
report of inexpedient to legislate on
 
04:58:31.830 --> 04:58:31.840 align:start position:0%
House Bill 1411 representative Carol
 
04:58:39.030 --> 04:58:39.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:39.040 --> 04:58:42.750 align:start position:0%
 
inquiry

04:58:42.750 --> 04:58:42.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:45.230 --> 04:58:45.240 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr Speaker I I apologize if
 
04:58:47.430 --> 04:58:47.440 align:start position:0%
I'm going to be a little bit repetitious
 
04:58:50.670 --> 04:58:50.680 align:start position:0%
it's likely if Mr Speaker if I know that
 
04:58:53.030 --> 04:58:53.040 align:start position:0%
it's very likely that no one in this
 
04:58:56.110 --> 04:58:56.120 align:start position:0%
room has to face the situation where
 
04:58:58.110 --> 04:58:58.120 align:start position:0%
they don't have a bank account they
 
04:58:59.788 --> 04:58:59.798 align:start position:0%
don't have a checkbook and therefore
 
04:59:02.830 --> 04:59:02.840 align:start position:0%
they don't have a debit card or a credit
 
04:59:05.430 --> 04:59:05.440 align:start position:0%
card and you can pay your bills in any
 
04:59:07.190 --> 04:59:07.200 align:start position:0%
way that anyone
 
04:59:10.070 --> 04:59:10.080 align:start position:0%
asks and if I and that there are many
 
04:59:11.470 --> 04:59:11.480 align:start position:0%
citizens of New Hampshire who are in
 
04:59:13.990 --> 04:59:14.000 align:start position:0%
that boat and Mr Speaker if I know that
 
04:59:15.990 --> 04:59:16.000 align:start position:0%
these people may not even have the extra
 
04:59:19.150 --> 04:59:19.160 align:start position:0%
money to go purchase money orders as was
 
04:59:20.470 --> 04:59:20.480 align:start position:0%
as was suggested during Committee
 
04:59:22.430 --> 04:59:22.440 align:start position:0%
hearing why don't they just get a money
 
04:59:24.030 --> 04:59:24.040 align:start position:0%
order they may not have the money to do
 
04:59:26.310 --> 04:59:26.320 align:start position:0%
that I know that sounds kind of crazy to
 
04:59:27.868 --> 04:59:27.878 align:start position:0%
all of
 
04:59:30.670 --> 04:59:30.680 align:start position:0%
us and Mr Speaker if I know that as was
 
04:59:30.680 --> 04:59:33.350 align:start position:0%
us and Mr Speaker if I know that as was
mentioned

04:59:33.350 --> 04:59:33.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:36.470 --> 04:59:36.480 align:start position:0%
already the toll boost on the Spalding
 
04:59:39.628 --> 04:59:39.638 align:start position:0%
turpike was a point of contention in the
 
04:59:42.548 --> 04:59:42.558 align:start position:0%
committee hearings and that if we move
 
04:59:44.350 --> 04:59:44.360 align:start position:0%
from this itl there is an amendment that
 
04:59:46.110 --> 04:59:46.120 align:start position:0%
takes care of that
 
04:59:48.948 --> 04:59:48.958 align:start position:0%
issue and finally Mr Speaker lastly and
 
04:59:50.350 --> 04:59:50.360 align:start position:0%
interestingly enough as it came out in
 
04:59:52.310 --> 04:59:52.320 align:start position:0%
the committee there are definitely also
 
04:59:56.470 --> 04:59:56.480 align:start position:0%
people in the room who would like to pay
 
04:59:58.788 --> 04:59:58.798 align:start position:0%
cash regardless of whether they have a
 
05:00:01.590 --> 05:00:01.600 align:start position:0%
bank account or not that's their
 
05:00:04.470 --> 05:00:04.480 align:start position:0%
preference and finally Mr Speaker
 
05:00:07.628 --> 05:00:07.638 align:start position:0%
understanding as my colleague said
 
05:00:07.638 --> 05:00:08.948 align:start position:0%
understanding as my colleague said
before

05:00:08.948 --> 05:00:08.958 align:start position:0%
before
 
05:00:11.788 --> 05:00:11.798 align:start position:0%
me it has been reported that the state
 
05:00:13.868 --> 05:00:13.878 align:start position:0%
agencies do take
 
05:00:16.390 --> 05:00:16.400 align:start position:0%
cash that the sponsor of the bill and
 
05:00:16.400 --> 05:00:18.270 align:start position:0%
cash that the sponsor of the bill and
those

05:00:18.270 --> 05:00:18.280 align:start position:0%
those
 
05:00:20.548 --> 05:00:20.558 align:start position:0%
supporting suggests that it's important
 
05:00:22.390 --> 05:00:22.400 align:start position:0%
to maintain that through the future
 
05:00:25.270 --> 05:00:25.280 align:start position:0%
because the way of life and the way we
 
05:00:26.910 --> 05:00:26.920 align:start position:0%
pay is changing so
 
05:00:29.708 --> 05:00:29.718 align:start position:0%
quickly in that case I would press uh
 
05:00:36.030 --> 05:00:36.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:38.510 --> 05:00:38.520 align:start position:0%
you somebody will tell them
 
05:00:39.948 --> 05:00:39.958 align:start position:0%
representative Carol McGuire's Rec
 
05:00:44.510 --> 05:00:44.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:48.070 --> 05:00:48.080 align:start position:0%
inquiry thank you Mr Speaker if I know
 
05:00:50.470 --> 05:00:50.480 align:start position:0%
that every state agency from every state
 
05:00:52.628 --> 05:00:52.638 align:start position:0%
that's ever existed is delighted to take
 
05:00:52.638 --> 05:00:53.708 align:start position:0%
that's ever existed is delighted to take
your

05:00:53.708 --> 05:00:53.718 align:start position:0%
your
 
05:00:56.670 --> 05:00:56.680 align:start position:0%
money and if I know that every state
 
05:00:59.350 --> 05:00:59.360 align:start position:0%
agency does in fact take cash and is
 
05:01:02.948 --> 05:01:02.958 align:start position:0%
glad to and if I know there are at least
 
05:01:06.030 --> 05:01:06.040 align:start position:0%
three legal ways to avoid to avoid

report thank you Mr
 
05:05:13.750 --> 05:05:13.760 align:start position:0%
Speaker Mr Speaker the Medicaid Program
 
05:05:16.110 --> 05:05:16.120 align:start position:0%
its appropriation implementation and
 
05:05:18.590 --> 05:05:18.600 align:start position:0%
coverage Provisions have been a major
 
05:05:20.750 --> 05:05:20.760 align:start position:0%
topic of conversation in this
 
05:05:23.788 --> 05:05:23.798 align:start position:0%
chamber as we all well remember the
 
05:05:25.628 --> 05:05:25.638 align:start position:0%
debate in committees and on this house
 
05:05:27.390 --> 05:05:27.400 align:start position:0%
floor about its seven-year expansion
 
05:05:29.510 --> 05:05:29.520 align:start position:0%
involved a great deal of
 
05:05:32.030 --> 05:05:32.040 align:start position:0%
discussion medical coverage for those in
 
05:05:34.750 --> 05:05:34.760 align:start position:0%
need is indeed an important matter and
 
05:05:36.390 --> 05:05:36.400 align:start position:0%
deserves our
 
05:05:39.750 --> 05:05:39.760 align:start position:0%
attention however the Medicaid Program
 
05:05:42.030 --> 05:05:42.040 align:start position:0%
is about procedures and treatment that
 
05:05:45.030 --> 05:05:45.040 align:start position:0%
are medically necessary and circumcision
 
05:05:47.110 --> 05:05:47.120 align:start position:0%
is not always such a
 
05:05:49.628 --> 05:05:49.638 align:start position:0%
procedure the majority respects those
 
05:05:51.990 --> 05:05:52.000 align:start position:0%
who believe in the procedure being
 
05:05:54.548 --> 05:05:54.558 align:start position:0%
performed whether it be for religious or
 
05:05:57.070 --> 05:05:57.080 align:start position:0%
other reasons the purpose of this bill
 
05:05:58.868 --> 05:05:58.878 align:start position:0%
is not to ban it
 
05:06:01.990 --> 05:06:02.000 align:start position:0%
altogether Mr Speaker and colleagues I
 
05:06:04.430 --> 05:06:04.440 align:start position:0%
ask that you press the green button and
 
05:06:06.270 --> 05:06:06.280 align:start position:0%
support the bipartisan majority
 
05:06:08.390 --> 05:06:08.400 align:start position:0%
recommendation of ought to pass as
 
05:06:11.270 --> 05:06:11.280 align:start position:0%

05:06:13.270 --> 05:06:13.280 align:start position:0%
speaker representative Shapiro's
 
05:06:17.910 --> 05:06:17.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:21.470 --> 05:06:21.480 align:start position:0%
report thank you Mr
 
05:06:23.788 --> 05:06:23.798 align:start position:0%
Speaker of all the things that I thought
 
05:06:25.708 --> 05:06:25.718 align:start position:0%
I never would do before I joined the
 
05:06:28.150 --> 05:06:28.160 align:start position:0%
legislature making a speech about
 
05:06:31.190 --> 05:06:31.200 align:start position:0%
circumcision to 400 of my peers probably
 
05:06:32.868 --> 05:06:32.878 align:start position:0%
tops the
 
05:06:35.868 --> 05:06:35.878 align:start position:0%
list nevertheless here I am asking you
 
05:06:39.590 --> 05:06:39.600 align:start position:0%
to oppose HB 1190 a bill that would end
 
05:06:41.948 --> 05:06:41.958 align:start position:0%
coverage in the Medicaid Program for
 
05:06:45.830 --> 05:06:45.840 align:start position:0%
routine circumcision of male
 
05:06:48.390 --> 05:06:48.400 align:start position:0%
infants currently New Hampshire Medicaid
 
05:06:51.390 --> 05:06:51.400 align:start position:0%
reimburses for circumcision at B at
 
05:06:54.708 --> 05:06:54.718 align:start position:0%
Birth as an elective procedure it is not
 
05:06:57.150 --> 05:06:57.160 align:start position:0%
considered cosmetic because there is
 
05:06:59.910 --> 05:06:59.920 align:start position:0%
ample research showing potential medical
 
05:07:02.548 --> 05:07:02.558 align:start position:0%
benefits such as reduction in penile
 
05:07:06.230 --> 05:07:06.240 align:start position:0%
Cancers and reduced rates of HIV
 
05:07:08.670 --> 05:07:08.680 align:start position:0%
transmission it is also not considered
 
05:07:12.110 --> 05:07:12.120 align:start position:0%
an urgent required procedure it is
 
05:07:15.868 --> 05:07:15.878 align:start position:0%
elective it is a choice a parental
 
05:07:18.350 --> 05:07:18.360 align:start position:0%
choice and I am here today to ask you
 
05:07:21.390 --> 05:07:21.400 align:start position:0%
not to take that parental choice that
 
05:07:24.310 --> 05:07:24.320 align:start position:0%
parental prerogative dare I say that
 
05:07:26.390 --> 05:07:26.400 align:start position:0%
parental right
 
05:07:28.750 --> 05:07:28.760 align:start position:0%
away passing this bill would be an
 
05:07:30.430 --> 05:07:30.440 align:start position:0%
intrusion into the freedom of New
 
05:07:32.150 --> 05:07:32.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire parents to make medical
 
05:07:34.910 --> 05:07:34.920 align:start position:0%
decisions for their
 
05:07:37.750 --> 05:07:37.760 align:start position:0%
families using Medicaid as a tool this
 
05:07:39.628 --> 05:07:39.638 align:start position:0%
bill will legislate the practice
 
05:07:42.110 --> 05:07:42.120 align:start position:0%
medicine something we try to avoid in
 
05:07:45.070 --> 05:07:45.080 align:start position:0%
health health human services and elderly
 
05:07:47.628 --> 05:07:47.638 align:start position:0%
Affairs one time it might be something
 
05:07:47.638 --> 05:07:48.390 align:start position:0%
Affairs one time it might be something
you

05:07:48.390 --> 05:07:48.400 align:start position:0%
you
 
05:07:50.910 --> 05:07:50.920 align:start position:0%
value sometimes it's something that your
 
05:07:53.788 --> 05:07:53.798 align:start position:0%
adversary values the reality is there's
 
05:07:56.750 --> 05:07:56.760 align:start position:0%
no end that's why we try to keep Health
 
05:07:59.270 --> 05:07:59.280 align:start position:0%
Care decisions between patients and
 
05:08:02.788 --> 05:08:02.798 align:start position:0%
providers this bill fails that
 
05:08:05.310 --> 05:08:05.320 align:start position:0%
test perhaps the most important reason
 
05:08:07.430 --> 05:08:07.440 align:start position:0%
to oppose HB
 
05:08:11.430 --> 05:08:11.440 align:start position:0%
1190 is the issue of Health care Equity
 
05:08:13.670 --> 05:08:13.680 align:start position:0%
passage of this bill will allow wealthy
 
05:08:15.868 --> 05:08:15.878 align:start position:0%
people or people with Private health
 
05:08:18.390 --> 05:08:18.400 align:start position:0%
insurance to make a choice about
 
05:08:22.510 --> 05:08:22.520 align:start position:0%
circumcision unencumbered by Financial
 
05:08:25.628 --> 05:08:25.638 align:start position:0%
concerns while lowincome Granite Staters
 
05:08:28.430 --> 05:08:28.440 align:start position:0%
including lowincome Muslim and Jewish
 
05:08:30.830 --> 05:08:30.840 align:start position:0%
granted Staters will have to consider
 
05:08:34.830 --> 05:08:34.840 align:start position:0%
the financial consequences of their
 
05:08:37.150 --> 05:08:37.160 align:start position:0%
decision now I know that some of you
 
05:08:38.910 --> 05:08:38.920 align:start position:0%
will say that the amendment to this bill
 
05:08:40.830 --> 05:08:40.840 align:start position:0%
will allow ow for broad doctor
 
05:08:43.150 --> 05:08:43.160 align:start position:0%
discretion and ironically that a bill
 
05:08:45.190 --> 05:08:45.200 align:start position:0%
that intends to prohibit reimbursement
 
05:08:47.990 --> 05:08:48.000 align:start position:0%
for routine male infant circumcision
 
05:08:51.230 --> 05:08:51.240 align:start position:0%
will actually allow it if a health care
 
05:08:53.390 --> 05:08:53.400 align:start position:0%
provider deems it medically
 
05:08:56.110 --> 05:08:56.120 align:start position:0%
necessary this however is just not the
 
05:08:58.548 --> 05:08:58.558 align:start position:0%
case the attorney for the Medicaid
 
05:09:01.310 --> 05:09:01.320 align:start position:0%
Program at DHHS informs me that as
 
05:09:03.788 --> 05:09:03.798 align:start position:0%
written the amendment is not even apply
 
05:09:06.830 --> 05:09:06.840 align:start position:0%
to infants and in no way clarifies what
 
05:09:08.830 --> 05:09:08.840 align:start position:0%
will be covered and what will not be
 
05:09:08.840 --> 05:09:11.390 align:start position:0%
will be covered and what will not be
covered

05:09:11.390 --> 05:09:11.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:13.350 --> 05:09:13.360 align:start position:0%
some testify that parents at a
 
05:09:15.470 --> 05:09:15.480 align:start position:0%
vulnerable moment having just given
 
05:09:18.628 --> 05:09:18.638 align:start position:0%
birth are unprepared to make a decision
 
05:09:21.270 --> 05:09:21.280 align:start position:0%
about circumcision that more education

is needed a fair and balanced
 
05:09:26.750 --> 05:09:26.760 align:start position:0%
presentation of the pros and cons of
 
05:09:30.510 --> 05:09:30.520 align:start position:0%
circumcision I totally agree unlike when
 
05:09:33.350 --> 05:09:33.360 align:start position:0%
my kids were born virtually every parent
 
05:09:36.750 --> 05:09:36.760 align:start position:0%
knows the sex of their child early on in
 
05:09:39.788 --> 05:09:39.798 align:start position:0%
pregnancy and in fact anti- circum ision
 
05:09:42.470 --> 05:09:42.480 align:start position:0%
activists have been very very successful
 
05:09:45.310 --> 05:09:45.320 align:start position:0%
in this regard rates of male
 
05:09:47.590 --> 05:09:47.600 align:start position:0%
circumcision have dropped dramatically
 
05:09:49.830 --> 05:09:49.840 align:start position:0%
over the past three
 
05:09:52.310 --> 05:09:52.320 align:start position:0%
decades in wrapping up I would ask you
 
05:09:55.310 --> 05:09:55.320 align:start position:0%
to put aside any personal feelings you
 
05:09:57.190 --> 05:09:57.200 align:start position:0%
might have about
 
05:09:59.430 --> 05:09:59.440 align:start position:0%
circumcision some of you clearly have
 
05:10:01.990 --> 05:10:02.000 align:start position:0%
very strong feelings about it and some
 
05:10:04.590 --> 05:10:04.600 align:start position:0%
like myself thought about it for a short
 
05:10:07.110 --> 05:10:07.120 align:start position:0%
period before their children were born
 
05:10:08.830 --> 05:10:08.840 align:start position:0%
in my case I ended up having two
 
05:10:08.840 --> 05:10:10.150 align:start position:0%
in my case I ended up having two
daughters

05:10:10.150 --> 05:10:10.160 align:start position:0%
daughters
 
05:10:11.830 --> 05:10:11.840 align:start position:0%
and then didn't give it much thought
 
05:10:15.310 --> 05:10:15.320 align:start position:0%
until now there is no right or wrong
 
05:10:18.990 --> 05:10:19.000 align:start position:0%
decision about male circumcision it is a
 
05:10:22.310 --> 05:10:22.320 align:start position:0%
deeply personal decision and should be
 
05:10:24.788 --> 05:10:24.798 align:start position:0%
made with adequate information and with
 
05:10:27.788 --> 05:10:27.798 align:start position:0%

is not an essential component of newborn

are not choosing circumcision it can no

would a young and un uninformed parent

declined to accept something ordered

offered by a doctor for

when he is certain to get Medicaid

performed on children without a
 
05:13:22.190 --> 05:13:22.200 align:start position:0%
diagnosis and it is the most common one

performed on them circumcision performed
 
05:13:27.750 --> 05:13:27.760 align:start position:0%
at parental request is something other
 
05:13:30.750 --> 05:13:30.760 align:start position:0%
than medicine and it cannot stand up to
 
05:13:33.470 --> 05:13:33.480 align:start position:0%
the objective budget scrutiny because it
 
05:13:35.750 --> 05:13:35.760 align:start position:0%
cannot meet Medicaid's criteria of

have been a registered Women's Health
 
05:14:01.548 --> 05:14:01.558 align:start position:0%

hospital who whether I love it or not my
 
05:14:15.070 --> 05:14:15.080 align:start position:0%
job is to bring the baby to the doctor
 
05:14:16.110 --> 05:14:16.120 align:start position:0%
to be
 
05:14:18.948 --> 05:14:18.958 align:start position:0%
circumcised I come to you today with
 
05:14:22.030 --> 05:14:22.040 align:start position:0%
that experience urging you to oppose
 
05:14:24.670 --> 05:14:24.680 align:start position:0%
this bill even though the amendment
 
05:14:27.470 --> 05:14:27.480 align:start position:0%
passed first I'd like to say I truly
 
05:14:29.910 --> 05:14:29.920 align:start position:0%
appreciate my colleague across the aisle
 
05:14:32.230 --> 05:14:32.240 align:start position:0%
the underlying intent of this bill is
 
05:14:34.628 --> 05:14:34.638 align:start position:0%
right on the money we desperately need
 
05:14:37.110 --> 05:14:37.120 align:start position:0%
better public health education about the
 
05:14:39.788 --> 05:14:39.798 align:start position:0%
the risks of circumcision de ision in
 
05:14:42.150 --> 05:14:42.160 align:start position:0%
fact I myself have spent my career
 
05:14:44.628 --> 05:14:44.638 align:start position:0%
educating families so that they can make
 
05:14:47.150 --> 05:14:47.160 align:start position:0%
a truly informed decision this is why I
 
05:14:49.510 --> 05:14:49.520 align:start position:0%
can't see right now uh so that they can
 
05:14:51.910 --> 05:14:51.920 align:start position:0%
make a truly informed decision about
 
05:14:54.670 --> 05:14:54.680 align:start position:0%
circumcising or not circumcising their
 
05:14:57.548 --> 05:14:57.558 align:start position:0%
babies my primary concern with this
 
05:15:00.190 --> 05:15:00.200 align:start position:0%
particular bill is that it does not take
 
05:15:03.868 --> 05:15:03.878 align:start position:0%
into account that currently most parents
 
05:15:07.110 --> 05:15:07.120 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire specifically expect to
 
05:15:09.708 --> 05:15:09.718 align:start position:0%
circumcise their son and this bill will
 
05:15:12.270 --> 05:15:12.280 align:start position:0%
suddenly and unexpectedly have that
 
05:15:14.470 --> 05:15:14.480 align:start position:0%
option stripped from them without
 
05:15:17.750 --> 05:15:17.760 align:start position:0%
warning I worry how an Abrupt ban will
 
05:15:20.430 --> 05:15:20.440 align:start position:0%
impact parents and Health Care Systems
 
05:15:22.548 --> 05:15:22.558 align:start position:0%
who were unprepared for a change like
 
05:15:25.070 --> 05:15:25.080 align:start position:0%
this a better option for addressing the
 
05:15:27.590 --> 05:15:27.600 align:start position:0%
prevalence of unnecessary circumcision
 
05:15:29.430 --> 05:15:29.440 align:start position:0%
would be to improve public health
 
05:15:32.510 --> 05:15:32.520 align:start position:0%
education instead of just Banning it as
 
05:15:35.350 --> 05:15:35.360 align:start position:0%
a clinici I am fully aware circumcision
 
05:15:37.910 --> 05:15:37.920 align:start position:0%
is not medically necessary but
 
05:15:43.150 --> 05:15:43.160 align:start position:0%
unfortunately it's not just that cut and
 
05:15:47.390 --> 05:15:47.400 align:start position:0%
dry I sorry the fact remains that the
 
05:15:47.400 --> 05:15:48.868 align:start position:0%
dry I sorry the fact remains that the
topic

05:15:48.868 --> 05:15:48.878 align:start position:0%
topic
 
05:15:52.470 --> 05:15:52.480 align:start position:0%
has the topic has been debated for years
 
05:15:54.470 --> 05:15:54.480 align:start position:0%
and even now as we started debating in
 
05:15:56.750 --> 05:15:56.760 align:start position:0%
our own bodies many Health Care
 
05:15:59.708 --> 05:15:59.718 align:start position:0%
Professionals are still unclear about
 
05:16:02.470 --> 05:16:02.480 align:start position:0%
whether or not circumcision is medically
 
05:16:05.750 --> 05:16:05.760 align:start position:0%
necessary or not and the majority of
 
05:16:07.830 --> 05:16:07.840 align:start position:0%
people in New Hampshire either still
 
05:16:09.628 --> 05:16:09.638 align:start position:0%
believe that circum decision is
 
05:16:12.788 --> 05:16:12.798 align:start position:0%
medically necessary or at the very least
 
05:16:14.750 --> 05:16:14.760 align:start position:0%
and this is from my experience working
 
05:16:19.270 --> 05:16:19.280 align:start position:0%
with them it's a very deeply invested
 
05:16:21.990 --> 05:16:22.000 align:start position:0%
cultural norm and it's important to them
 
05:16:24.868 --> 05:16:24.878 align:start position:0%
and their identity if many Healthcare
 
05:16:26.910 --> 05:16:26.920 align:start position:0%
Providers don't even have the accurate
 
05:16:29.390 --> 05:16:29.400 align:start position:0%
information how are parents supposed to
 
05:16:31.708 --> 05:16:31.718 align:start position:0%
get the correct information now we heard
 
05:16:34.670 --> 05:16:34.680 align:start position:0%
a statistic that circumcision is down to
 
05:16:34.680 --> 05:16:35.470 align:start position:0%
a statistic that circumcision is down to
about

05:16:35.470 --> 05:16:35.480 align:start position:0%
about
 
05:16:38.030 --> 05:16:38.040 align:start position:0%
55% that's true but that's a national
 
05:16:41.350 --> 05:16:41.360 align:start position:0%
figure in New Hampshire
 
05:16:44.788 --> 05:16:44.798 align:start position:0%
76% of boys get circumcised and in other
 
05:16:48.430 --> 05:16:48.440 align:start position:0%
states it's down to 10 to 50% based on a
 
05:16:50.990 --> 05:16:51.000 align:start position:0%
really great job at public education so
 
05:16:53.948 --> 05:16:53.958 align:start position:0%
it really is when we're looking at 76%
 
05:16:55.910 --> 05:16:55.920 align:start position:0%
it's realistic to say that when most
 
05:16:58.548 --> 05:16:58.558 align:start position:0%
parents in New Hampshire go to have
 
05:17:00.708 --> 05:17:00.718 align:start position:0%
their baby they're assuming that they
 
05:17:02.708 --> 05:17:02.718 align:start position:0%
will circumcise their son and that they
 
05:17:05.150 --> 05:17:05.160 align:start position:0%
will have that option now for just a
 
05:17:07.830 --> 05:17:07.840 align:start position:0%
minute if any of you were parents think
 
05:17:09.510 --> 05:17:09.520 align:start position:0%
back to the first day you held that
 
05:17:11.868 --> 05:17:11.878 align:start position:0%
newborn baby in your arms how you might
 
05:17:13.510 --> 05:17:13.520 align:start position:0%
have been scared about what kind of
 
05:17:15.590 --> 05:17:15.600 align:start position:0%
parent you were going to be how you
 
05:17:17.590 --> 05:17:17.600 align:start position:0%
desperately wanted to do everything you
 
05:17:19.390 --> 05:17:19.400 align:start position:0%
could possibly do to take care of your
 
05:17:21.990 --> 05:17:22.000 align:start position:0%
baby in the best way that you knew how
 
05:17:24.230 --> 05:17:24.240 align:start position:0%
and anybody's a parent knows you didn't
 
05:17:27.430 --> 05:17:27.440 align:start position:0%
know how but you learned now imagine
 
05:17:30.070 --> 05:17:30.080 align:start position:0%
that the nurse told you that the care
 
05:17:32.590 --> 05:17:32.600 align:start position:0%
that you believed your baby needed would
 
05:17:35.470 --> 05:17:35.480 align:start position:0%
not be available to you because of your
 
05:17:37.868 --> 05:17:37.878 align:start position:0%
low income because that's what I'm going
 
05:17:39.310 --> 05:17:39.320 align:start position:0%
to have to say to people people in the
 
05:17:41.910 --> 05:17:41.920 align:start position:0%
room with them if we pass this right now
 
05:17:44.230 --> 05:17:44.240 align:start position:0%
how would that have affected you in that
 
05:17:47.030 --> 05:17:47.040 align:start position:0%
moment exhausted and just learning how
 
05:17:49.390 --> 05:17:49.400 align:start position:0%
to be a new parent how would it have
 
05:17:50.750 --> 05:17:50.760 align:start position:0%
affected your
 
05:17:53.190 --> 05:17:53.200 align:start position:0%
selfworth these are the kinds of moments
 
05:17:55.590 --> 05:17:55.600 align:start position:0%
that stick with people for a lifetime
 
05:17:57.548 --> 05:17:57.558 align:start position:0%
and can have long-term impacts on
 
05:18:00.070 --> 05:18:00.080 align:start position:0%
maternal mental health the birth and
 
05:18:02.350 --> 05:18:02.360 align:start position:0%
immediate postpartum experience
 
05:18:04.868 --> 05:18:04.878 align:start position:0%
significantly impact the risk of
 
05:18:08.150 --> 05:18:08.160 align:start position:0%
postpartum mental health issues and I
 
05:18:11.030 --> 05:18:11.040 align:start position:0%
fear that suddenly Banning circumcisions
 
05:18:13.230 --> 05:18:13.240 align:start position:0%
could have detrimental effects on many
 
05:18:15.310 --> 05:18:15.320 align:start position:0%
of our mothers especially those with
 
05:18:18.310 --> 05:18:18.320 align:start position:0%
Medicaid coverage who are already often
 
05:18:20.470 --> 05:18:20.480 align:start position:0%
at a higher risk for mental health
 
05:18:22.708 --> 05:18:22.718 align:start position:0%
conditions some of you might brush off
 
05:18:25.030 --> 05:18:25.040 align:start position:0%
this idea but having interviewed
 
05:18:26.910 --> 05:18:26.920 align:start position:0%
thousands of pregnant and postpartum
 
05:18:29.230 --> 05:18:29.240 align:start position:0%
women about their stories of birth
 
05:18:31.628 --> 05:18:31.638 align:start position:0%
trauma and Associated postpartum
 
05:18:34.788 --> 05:18:34.798 align:start position:0%
depression and anxiety I can assure you
 
05:18:37.708 --> 05:18:37.718 align:start position:0%
this is a sincere
 
05:18:40.990 --> 05:18:41.000 align:start position:0%
concern it's true we should absolutely
 
05:18:43.708 --> 05:18:43.718 align:start position:0%
work as a bipartisan body to decrease
 
05:18:45.868 --> 05:18:45.878 align:start position:0%
unnecessary circumcisions in the state
 
05:18:48.470 --> 05:18:48.480 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire but Banning it only for
 
05:18:51.310 --> 05:18:51.320 align:start position:0%
the granite Staters who are lowincome
 
05:18:53.750 --> 05:18:53.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't even address the problem of
 
05:18:56.430 --> 05:18:56.440 align:start position:0%
misinformation about circumcision and it
 
05:18:58.868 --> 05:18:58.878 align:start position:0%
has a more potential to it has a
 
05:19:01.990 --> 05:19:02.000 align:start position:0%
potential to do more harm than good I
 
05:19:04.070 --> 05:19:04.080 align:start position:0%
suggest that instead we start with a
 
05:19:06.590 --> 05:19:06.600 align:start position:0%
robust Health excuse me Public Health
 
05:19:08.948 --> 05:19:08.958 align:start position:0%
campaign and work towards bringing those
 
05:19:11.430 --> 05:19:11.440 align:start position:0%
circumcision numbers down organically
 
05:19:13.548 --> 05:19:13.558 align:start position:0%
like so many other states have done
 
05:19:15.750 --> 05:19:15.760 align:start position:0%
let's take the time to explore other
 
05:19:19.430 --> 05:19:19.440 align:start position:0%
options more closely along with healthc
 
05:19:21.390 --> 05:19:21.400 align:start position:0%
Care Professionals so that we can
 
05:19:23.830 --> 05:19:23.840 align:start position:0%
develop a solution that relies on
 
05:19:27.070 --> 05:19:27.080 align:start position:0%
education and collaboration instead of
 
05:19:30.270 --> 05:19:30.280 align:start position:0%
force thank you does a member yield for
 
05:19:30.280 --> 05:19:31.788 align:start position:0%
force thank you does a member yield for
a

05:19:31.788 --> 05:19:31.798 align:start position:0%
a
 
05:19:37.390 --> 05:19:37.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:40.030 --> 05:19:40.040 align:start position:0%
you re pres Ellen re's recognized to
 
05:19:43.030 --> 05:19:43.040 align:start position:0%
speak in support of the committee
 
05:19:47.230 --> 05:19:47.240 align:start position:0%
report thank you Mr Speaker um this
 
05:19:48.948 --> 05:19:48.958 align:start position:0%
won't be a surprise to anyone I don't
 
05:19:50.590 --> 05:19:50.600 align:start position:0%
think but I'm a huge proponent of
 
05:19:54.350 --> 05:19:54.360 align:start position:0%
socialized Health Care uh a huge
 
05:19:57.470 --> 05:19:57.480 align:start position:0%
proponent but circumcision medically
 
05:20:00.110 --> 05:20:00.120 align:start position:0%
unnecessary circumcision on infant boys
 
05:20:03.548 --> 05:20:03.558 align:start position:0%
is the only elective caus medic
 
05:20:06.350 --> 05:20:06.360 align:start position:0%
medically unnecessary procedure that we
 
05:20:09.230 --> 05:20:09.240 align:start position:0%
spend taxpayer money on
 
05:20:11.310 --> 05:20:11.320 align:start position:0%
it's also the only
 
05:20:14.430 --> 05:20:14.440 align:start position:0%
cultural and the only religious-based
 
05:20:16.990 --> 05:20:17.000 align:start position:0%
procedure that we spend taxpayer money
 
05:20:18.230 --> 05:20:18.240 align:start position:0%
on now I want to be really clear it's
 
05:20:20.310 --> 05:20:20.320 align:start position:0%
not a religious procedure as it is done
 
05:20:22.430 --> 05:20:22.440 align:start position:0%
in the hospital because in order for it
 
05:20:24.350 --> 05:20:24.360 align:start position:0%
to be a religious procedure it has to be
 
05:20:26.628 --> 05:20:26.638 align:start position:0%
done in a certain time like eight days
 
05:20:28.868 --> 05:20:28.878 align:start position:0%
after birth and by a certain clergy
 
05:20:30.830 --> 05:20:30.840 align:start position:0%
person so that's not what's happening
 
05:20:33.150 --> 05:20:33.160 align:start position:0%
what's happening is it's become a
 
05:20:35.948 --> 05:20:35.958 align:start position:0%
cultural norm that we do not
 
05:20:39.110 --> 05:20:39.120 align:start position:0%
question but we are in effect virtually
 
05:20:42.070 --> 05:20:42.080 align:start position:0%
the only country that does this
 
05:20:44.708 --> 05:20:44.718 align:start position:0%
routinely by
 
05:20:48.470 --> 05:20:48.480 align:start position:0%
default 80% of the men of the world are
 
05:20:48.480 --> 05:20:49.350 align:start position:0%
default 80% of the men of the world are
not

05:20:49.350 --> 05:20:49.360 align:start position:0%
not
 
05:20:52.270 --> 05:20:52.280 align:start position:0%
circumcised and they're doing
 
05:20:56.628 --> 05:20:56.638 align:start position:0%
okay in fact it's not just we're the
 
05:20:59.190 --> 05:20:59.200 align:start position:0%
only country human beings are the only
 
05:21:01.708 --> 05:21:01.718 align:start position:0%
species we claim that it supposedly is
 
05:21:04.510 --> 05:21:04.520 align:start position:0%
medically necessary to do this at Birth
 
05:21:06.070 --> 05:21:06.080 align:start position:0%
other species that are born with
 
05:21:09.070 --> 05:21:09.080 align:start position:0%
foreskin dogs cats horses un it they
 
05:21:12.670 --> 05:21:12.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:15.910 --> 05:21:15.920 align:start position:0%
fine in fact it's it's purely
 
05:21:15.920 --> 05:21:19.150 align:start position:0%
fine in fact it's it's purely
cultural

05:21:19.150 --> 05:21:19.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:22.110 --> 05:21:22.120 align:start position:0%
and member will suspend for a minute
 
05:21:24.788 --> 05:21:24.798 align:start position:0%
noise levels Rising steadily let's
 
05:21:27.830 --> 05:21:27.840 align:start position:0%
descend it steadily thank you
 
05:21:30.350 --> 05:21:30.360 align:start position:0%
continue thank you Mr
 
05:21:35.030 --> 05:21:35.040 align:start position:0%
Speaker one in 16,000 uncircumcised men
 
05:21:37.270 --> 05:21:37.280 align:start position:0%
end up needing a circumcision for
 
05:21:41.670 --> 05:21:41.680 align:start position:0%
medical reasons later in life but 11% of
 
05:21:44.750 --> 05:21:44.760 align:start position:0%
circumcised infants have some form of
 
05:21:46.590 --> 05:21:46.600 align:start position:0%
complication including the need for
 
05:21:46.600 --> 05:21:47.830 align:start position:0%
complication including the need for
revision

05:21:47.830 --> 05:21:47.840 align:start position:0%
revision
 
05:21:50.948 --> 05:21:50.958 align:start position:0%
surgeries some of those infants end up
 
05:21:53.590 --> 05:21:53.600 align:start position:0%
being children that have long- lasting
 
05:21:57.548 --> 05:21:57.558 align:start position:0%
negative medical impacts from those
 
05:21:59.548 --> 05:21:59.558 align:start position:0%
complications what it really comes down
 
05:22:02.150 --> 05:22:02.160 align:start position:0%
to is choice and bodily autonomy and we
 
05:22:04.910 --> 05:22:04.920 align:start position:0%
talk a lot about those Concepts here now
 
05:22:06.830 --> 05:22:06.840 align:start position:0%
I know that a previous speaker just said
 
05:22:09.230 --> 05:22:09.240 align:start position:0%
that this is a parental choice
 
05:22:10.910 --> 05:22:10.920 align:start position:0%
but it's not a parental Choice when that
 
05:22:12.788 --> 05:22:12.798 align:start position:0%
child becomes an adult and that choice
 
05:22:15.990 --> 05:22:16.000 align:start position:0%
has been taken away from them because if
 
05:22:18.590 --> 05:22:18.600 align:start position:0%
you choose to circumcise your infant
 
05:22:19.948 --> 05:22:19.958 align:start position:0%
they don't get to choose to be
 
05:22:22.590 --> 05:22:22.600 align:start position:0%
uncircumcised when they're older if you
 
05:22:24.788 --> 05:22:24.798 align:start position:0%
don't circumcise then they get to make
 
05:22:28.788 --> 05:22:28.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:31.190 --> 05:22:31.200 align:start position:0%
older another thing I want to bring up
 
05:22:34.270 --> 05:22:34.280 align:start position:0%
is the fact that Medicade does not cover
 
05:22:37.788 --> 05:22:37.798 align:start position:0%
female genital mutilation now here's the
 
05:22:39.510 --> 05:22:39.520 align:start position:0%
thing about that before you say well
 
05:22:41.750 --> 05:22:41.760 align:start position:0%
that's different some of it is very very
 
05:22:43.390 --> 05:22:43.400 align:start position:0%
different some forms of female genital
 
05:22:46.070 --> 05:22:46.080 align:start position:0%
mutilation are extremely severe however
 
05:22:49.470 --> 05:22:49.480 align:start position:0%
the most common form in the world is
 
05:22:52.510 --> 05:22:52.520 align:start position:0%
analogous exactly to circumcision it is
 
05:22:55.350 --> 05:22:55.360 align:start position:0%
the removal of the clitoral hood we do
 
05:22:58.868 --> 05:22:58.878 align:start position:0%
not cover that with taxpayer money also
 
05:23:02.030 --> 05:23:02.040 align:start position:0%
it's illegal to do it at all on a female
 
05:23:04.590 --> 05:23:04.600 align:start position:0%
child in this
 
05:23:07.430 --> 05:23:07.440 align:start position:0%
country so female infants have
 
05:23:09.990 --> 05:23:10.000 align:start position:0%
protections that not only do we not
 
05:23:13.110 --> 05:23:13.120 align:start position:0%
extent to extend to male infants we
 
05:23:16.110 --> 05:23:16.120 align:start position:0%
actually pay for those male infants to
 
05:23:19.910 --> 05:23:19.920 align:start position:0%
have healthy tissue removed from Healthy
 
05:23:22.708 --> 05:23:22.718 align:start position:0%
Babies healthy tissue removed from
 
05:23:22.718 --> 05:23:24.310 align:start position:0%
Babies healthy tissue removed from
Healthy

05:23:24.310 --> 05:23:24.320 align:start position:0%
Healthy
 
05:23:26.628 --> 05:23:26.638 align:start position:0%
Babies the truth of the matter is I'm a
 
05:23:28.390 --> 05:23:28.400 align:start position:0%
strong proponent of socialized medicine
 
05:23:29.948 --> 05:23:29.958 align:start position:0%
so I believe that the money that's being
 
05:23:31.708 --> 05:23:31.718 align:start position:0%
spent removing healthy tissue from
 
05:23:34.030 --> 05:23:34.040 align:start position:0%
Healthy Babies should be spent on
 
05:23:36.628 --> 05:23:36.638 align:start position:0%
medically necessary treatment for
 
05:23:39.310 --> 05:23:39.320 align:start position:0%
children now I appreciate the previous
 
05:23:42.548 --> 05:23:42.558 align:start position:0%
speaker who wanted to um make a point
 
05:23:45.670 --> 05:23:45.680 align:start position:0%
about the access for the poor to this um
 
05:23:46.868 --> 05:23:46.878 align:start position:0%
to this
 
05:23:49.750 --> 05:23:49.760 align:start position:0%
procedure but we would never want to
 
05:23:52.990 --> 05:23:53.000 align:start position:0%
increase access for the removal of the
 
05:23:55.110 --> 05:23:55.120 align:start position:0%
clitoral hood for example we wouldn't
 
05:23:58.830 --> 05:23:58.840 align:start position:0%
want to increase access for that 17
 
05:24:01.510 --> 05:24:01.520 align:start position:0%
states do not use Medicaid funds to
 
05:24:03.830 --> 05:24:03.840 align:start position:0%
cover unnecessary circumcision and the
 
05:24:05.390 --> 05:24:05.400 align:start position:0%
sky is not falling in those States
 
05:24:08.070 --> 05:24:08.080 align:start position:0%
there's no trauma to to parents in those
 
05:24:10.548 --> 05:24:10.558 align:start position:0%
States there's no discrimination in
 
05:24:10.558 --> 05:24:12.750 align:start position:0%

inquiry thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker
 
05:26:25.230 --> 05:26:25.240 align:start position:0%
if I know that one's vote on this bill
 
05:26:27.030 --> 05:26:27.040 align:start position:0%
should have nothing to do with one's
 
05:26:28.868 --> 05:26:28.878 align:start position:0%
personal feelings about
 
05:26:31.390 --> 05:26:31.400 align:start position:0%
circumcision and Mr Speaker if I know
 
05:26:33.910 --> 05:26:33.920 align:start position:0%
this bill will intrude upon and diminish
 
05:26:36.788 --> 05:26:36.798 align:start position:0%
a parents rights to make Health Care
 
05:26:39.590 --> 05:26:39.600 align:start position:0%
decisions for their children
 
05:26:42.830 --> 05:26:42.840 align:start position:0%
and Mr Speaker if I know that it is an
 
05:26:45.390 --> 05:26:45.400 align:start position:0%
insult to New Hampshire citizens to
 
05:26:45.400 --> 05:26:48.030 align:start position:0%
insult to New Hampshire citizens to
believe

05:26:48.030 --> 05:26:48.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:51.230 --> 05:26:51.240 align:start position:0%
that citizens will use circumcision
 
05:26:54.910 --> 05:26:54.920 align:start position:0%
merely because it's free and or doctors
 
05:26:57.510 --> 05:26:57.520 align:start position:0%
will do circumcisions to make money off
 
05:27:01.750 --> 05:27:01.760 align:start position:0%
of it and if I know that in the long run
 
05:27:04.470 --> 05:27:04.480 align:start position:0%
persuasion is more effective than
 
05:27:07.670 --> 05:27:07.680 align:start position:0%
force would I then urge you Mr Speaker
 
05:27:09.990 --> 05:27:10.000 align:start position:0%

reason to believe uh that additional

Kenny uh thank you Mr Speaker uh so this
 
05:41:06.110 --> 05:41:06.120 align:start position:0%
floor Amendment satisfies the people
 
05:41:08.468 --> 05:41:08.478 align:start position:0%
most likely to be involved in right to
 
05:41:11.070 --> 05:41:11.080 align:start position:0%
no request disputes and solves a number
 
05:41:12.788 --> 05:41:12.798 align:start position:0%
of problems identified by the New
 
05:41:14.868 --> 05:41:14.878 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Supreme Court over the past
 
05:41:17.948 --> 05:41:17.958 align:start position:0%
several years uh such as the lack of
 
05:41:21.270 --> 05:41:21.280 align:start position:0%
collaboration between requesters and the
 
05:41:23.670 --> 05:41:23.680 align:start position:0%
government uh like I previously said the
 
05:41:25.708 --> 05:41:25.718 align:start position:0%
groups involved in these discussions and
 
05:41:27.990 --> 05:41:28.000 align:start position:0%
compromise include the ACLU New
 
05:41:29.868 --> 05:41:29.878 align:start position:0%
Hampshire press Association right to
 
05:41:31.030 --> 05:41:31.040 align:start position:0%
know New Hampshire New Hampshire
 
05:41:33.590 --> 05:41:33.600 align:start position:0%
Municipal Association and of course
 
05:41:36.230 --> 05:41:36.240 align:start position:0%
legislators uh from the Judiciary
 
05:41:38.270 --> 05:41:38.280 align:start position:0%
Committee so the floor Amendment
 
05:41:40.230 --> 05:41:40.240 align:start position:0%
provides a local option to allow
 
05:41:42.830 --> 05:41:42.840 align:start position:0%
charging a per electronic communication
 
05:41:46.788 --> 05:41:46.798 align:start position:0%
charge of up to $1 per page but the
 
05:41:50.788 --> 05:41:50.798 align:start position:0%
first 250 Communications are always free
 
05:41:53.310 --> 05:41:53.320 align:start position:0%
electronic communications is defined and
 
05:41:55.830 --> 05:41:55.840 align:start position:0%
narrowly tailored to Target only the
 
05:41:57.948 --> 05:41:57.958 align:start position:0%
sources of the largest and most
 
05:41:57.958 --> 05:41:59.270 align:start position:0%
sources of the largest and most
problematic

05:41:59.270 --> 05:41:59.280 align:start position:0%
problematic
 
05:42:02.270 --> 05:42:02.280 align:start position:0%
requests it provides language to ensure
 
05:42:04.390 --> 05:42:04.400 align:start position:0%
that those who cannot afford to pay for
 
05:42:07.548 --> 05:42:07.558 align:start position:0%
requests will not be charged it
 
05:42:09.750 --> 05:42:09.760 align:start position:0%
specifies that requests in the Public's
 
05:42:11.830 --> 05:42:11.840 align:start position:0%
interest will not be charged as well and
 
05:42:13.788 --> 05:42:13.798 align:start position:0%
Define such requests using wording
 
05:42:16.110 --> 05:42:16.120 align:start position:0%
agreed upon by these
 
05:42:18.628 --> 05:42:18.638 align:start position:0%
stakeholders it also offers an appeal
 
05:42:20.590 --> 05:42:20.600 align:start position:0%
process to ensure that public interest
 
05:42:23.830 --> 05:42:23.840 align:start position:0%
requests are never charged lastly the
 
05:42:25.830 --> 05:42:25.840 align:start position:0%
language of the floor Amendment still
 
05:42:27.430 --> 05:42:27.440 align:start position:0%
promotes collaboration between the
 
05:42:29.468 --> 05:42:29.478 align:start position:0%
government and requesters and it
 
05:42:31.708 --> 05:42:31.718 align:start position:0%
encourages the use of automated
 
05:42:34.230 --> 05:42:34.240 align:start position:0%
redaction processes to speed up the
 
05:42:38.230 --> 05:42:38.240 align:start position:0%
production of Records so in short this B
 
05:42:40.070 --> 05:42:40.080 align:start position:0%
this is a balanced compromise that
 
05:42:43.030 --> 05:42:43.040 align:start position:0%
ensures government transparency yet it
 
05:42:45.190 --> 05:42:45.200 align:start position:0%
deals with right to no requests that are
 
05:42:48.390 --> 05:42:48.400 align:start position:0%
in bad faith therefore I urge my
 
05:42:50.270 --> 05:42:50.280 align:start position:0%
colleagues to adopt uh the floor
 
05:42:54.110 --> 05:42:54.120 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr Speaker colleagues this is
 
05:49:15.670 --> 05:49:15.680 align:start position:0%
deja vu all over again this bill uh was
 
05:49:18.628 --> 05:49:18.638 align:start position:0%
originally passed last year by this body
 
05:49:22.350 --> 05:49:22.360 align:start position:0%
uh but was killed in the other body um I
 
05:49:26.190 --> 05:49:26.200 align:start position:0%
I will try to keep my remarks relatively
 
05:49:28.670 --> 05:49:28.680 align:start position:0%
brief basically the issue here as as
 
05:49:32.270 --> 05:49:32.280 align:start position:0%
I've said last year is does a contract
 
05:49:34.948 --> 05:49:34.958 align:start position:0%
mean what a contract says that's what
 
05:49:38.390 --> 05:49:38.400 align:start position:0%
this is all about in 2005 the New
 
05:49:40.110 --> 05:49:40.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Supreme Court issued a
 
05:49:42.750 --> 05:49:42.760 align:start position:0%
decision in which it said that the fact
 
05:49:47.230 --> 05:49:47.240 align:start position:0%
that a lease is for a specific term of
 
05:49:49.628 --> 05:49:49.638 align:start position:0%
for example a year doesn't mean that
 
05:49:51.868 --> 05:49:51.878 align:start position:0%
it's that it actually is binding on the
 
05:49:54.830 --> 05:49:54.840 align:start position:0%
tenant um if at the end of the year so
 
05:49:56.150 --> 05:49:56.160 align:start position:0%
that at the end of the year and by the
 
05:49:57.868 --> 05:49:57.878 align:start position:0%
way I should say this this applies to
 
05:50:00.270 --> 05:50:00.280 align:start position:0%
what's called restricted property
 
05:50:03.830 --> 05:50:03.840 align:start position:0%
restricted property can be as little as
 
05:50:06.430 --> 05:50:06.440 align:start position:0%
a two family h two you have two rental
 
05:50:08.670 --> 05:50:08.680 align:start position:0%
unit as long as you don't live in one of
 
05:50:10.788 --> 05:50:10.798 align:start position:0%
the rental units that's restricted
 
05:50:13.830 --> 05:50:13.840 align:start position:0%
property and it's covered by this this
 
05:50:16.670 --> 05:50:16.680 align:start position:0%
decision at the end of the year if the
 
05:50:19.910 --> 05:50:19.920 align:start position:0%
if if the tenant wants to stay you can't
 
05:50:22.350 --> 05:50:22.360 align:start position:0%
kick the tenant out evict the tenant
 
05:50:24.948 --> 05:50:24.958 align:start position:0%
just because the lease is up that's what
 
05:50:27.590 --> 05:50:27.600 align:start position:0%
the uh what the Supreme Court uh said in
 
05:50:28.788 --> 05:50:28.798 align:start position:0%
that case it doesn't matter what the
 
05:50:31.230 --> 05:50:31.240 align:start position:0%
lease says the tenant of course is free
 
05:50:33.990 --> 05:50:34.000 align:start position:0%
to leave at the end of the year how does
 
05:50:35.468 --> 05:50:35.478 align:start position:0%
that make any
 
05:50:38.948 --> 05:50:38.958 align:start position:0%
sense that the decision was uh was not a
 
05:50:40.750 --> 05:50:40.760 align:start position:0%
unanimous decision of the Supreme Court
 
05:50:43.830 --> 05:50:43.840 align:start position:0%
and one of the one of the uh justices
 
05:50:46.190 --> 05:50:46.200 align:start position:0%
who concurred especially was Justice Joe
 
05:50:49.670 --> 05:50:49.680 align:start position:0%
Netto an appointee of Governor Shaheen a
 
05:50:52.670 --> 05:50:52.680 align:start position:0%
longtime Democrat and hardly a
 
05:50:55.510 --> 05:50:55.520 align:start position:0%
right-wing you know extremist here's
 
05:50:58.990 --> 05:50:59.000 align:start position:0%
what he had to say under the majority's
 
05:51:01.110 --> 05:51:01.120 align:start position:0%
interpretation lease Provisions
 
05:51:03.030 --> 05:51:03.040 align:start position:0%
purporting to limit the lease to a
 
05:51:06.070 --> 05:51:06.080 align:start position:0%
specified Dura uh duration have no
 
05:51:06.080 --> 05:51:07.230 align:start position:0%
specified Dura uh duration have no
meaning

05:51:07.230 --> 05:51:07.240 align:start position:0%
meaning
 
05:51:08.830 --> 05:51:08.840 align:start position:0%
the effect of the majority's
 
05:51:11.750 --> 05:51:11.760 align:start position:0%
interpretation is to create a Perpetual
 
05:51:15.230 --> 05:51:15.240 align:start position:0%
tency virtually a life interest in favor
 
05:51:17.548 --> 05:51:17.558 align:start position:0%
of a tenant of restricted property
 
05:51:20.670 --> 05:51:20.680 align:start position:0%
covered by the statute I do not believe
 
05:51:22.230 --> 05:51:22.240 align:start position:0%
that was the int that this was the
 
05:51:23.868 --> 05:51:23.878 align:start position:0%
intent of the
 
05:51:26.350 --> 05:51:26.360 align:start position:0%
legislature the Court's decision was
 
05:51:29.628 --> 05:51:29.638 align:start position:0%
ostensibly designed to protect tenants
 
05:51:31.590 --> 05:51:31.600 align:start position:0%
but I ask you to think about this as I
 
05:51:33.230 --> 05:51:33.240 align:start position:0%
as I said last time and I apologize if
 
05:51:34.750 --> 05:51:34.760 align:start position:0%
I'm repeating but I think it's important
 
05:51:37.948 --> 05:51:37.958 align:start position:0%
to say this the the effect of this
 
05:51:42.030 --> 05:51:42.040 align:start position:0%
decision is this if you are a landlord
 
05:51:43.948 --> 05:51:43.958 align:start position:0%
and you are considering someone who
 
05:51:46.390 --> 05:51:46.400 align:start position:0%
might be sort of a marginal tenant
 
05:51:49.788 --> 05:51:49.798 align:start position:0%
you're not sure this person maybe has a
 
05:51:53.750 --> 05:51:53.760 align:start position:0%
you know a a a shady credit history um
 
05:51:56.310 --> 05:51:56.320 align:start position:0%
or some other things some other things
 
05:51:58.070 --> 05:51:58.080 align:start position:0%
and you now have to decide do I want
 
05:52:01.670 --> 05:52:01.680 align:start position:0%
this person as my tenant or not if the
 
05:52:04.110 --> 05:52:04.120 align:start position:0%
law is as it stands now that once you
 
05:52:06.070 --> 05:52:06.080 align:start position:0%
take that person as a tenant you're
 
05:52:08.468 --> 05:52:08.478 align:start position:0%
stuck with with with that person or that
 
05:52:10.990 --> 05:52:11.000 align:start position:0%
family or whatever you're going to think
 
05:52:12.910 --> 05:52:12.920 align:start position:0%
really really carefully before you make
 
05:52:14.990 --> 05:52:15.000 align:start position:0%
that decision on the other hand if the
 
05:52:17.270 --> 05:52:17.280 align:start position:0%
law is as I submit it should be that if
 
05:52:19.350 --> 05:52:19.360 align:start position:0%
you make a lease for a year it's a lease
 
05:52:21.750 --> 05:52:21.760 align:start position:0%
for a year so that if you so that if it
 
05:52:23.230 --> 05:52:23.240 align:start position:0%
doesn't work out at the end of the year
 
05:52:24.830 --> 05:52:24.840 align:start position:0%
you can say I'm sorry the lease is up
 
05:52:26.708 --> 05:52:26.718 align:start position:0%
and you know I want you to leave you're
 
05:52:28.310 --> 05:52:28.320 align:start position:0%
going to be much more likely to be
 
05:52:30.030 --> 05:52:30.040 align:start position:0%
willing to take that risk if you can
 
05:52:31.430 --> 05:52:31.440 align:start position:0%
limit it in that
 
05:52:34.190 --> 05:52:34.200 align:start position:0%
way that's why I believe that we should
 
05:52:36.548 --> 05:52:36.558 align:start position:0%
defeat this itl motion and support this
 
05:52:39.350 --> 05:52:39.360 align:start position:0%
will let me say one other thing that I
 
05:52:42.150 --> 05:52:42.160 align:start position:0%
think it's important to say and that's
 
05:52:44.468 --> 05:52:44.478 align:start position:0%
concerning my understanding is that at
 
05:52:46.110 --> 05:52:46.120 align:start position:0%
least some of the reason this bill
 
05:52:48.708 --> 05:52:48.718 align:start position:0%
failed in the other body was a claim
 
05:52:50.708 --> 05:52:50.718 align:start position:0%
that well because we have such low
 
05:52:53.150 --> 05:52:53.160 align:start position:0%
vacancy rates this will this will result
 
05:52:55.510 --> 05:52:55.520 align:start position:0%
in increased homelessness it's uh you
 
05:52:58.310 --> 05:52:58.320 align:start position:0%
know we have to we have we can't do this
 
05:53:00.468 --> 05:53:00.478 align:start position:0%
this whole homeless argument I suggest
 
05:53:03.510 --> 05:53:03.520 align:start position:0%
to you is a nice a nice sound bite but
 
05:53:05.390 --> 05:53:05.400 align:start position:0%
if you think it through it doesn't
 
05:53:07.230 --> 05:53:07.240 align:start position:0%
actually make any sense
 
05:53:09.350 --> 05:53:09.360 align:start position:0%
it is true that there are very low let's
 
05:53:11.750 --> 05:53:11.760 align:start position:0%
assume almost No Vacancy rates now it's
 
05:53:12.788 --> 05:53:12.798 align:start position:0%
down to
 
05:53:16.628 --> 05:53:16.638 align:start position:0%
like4 or 5% so stop and think about what
 
05:53:20.390 --> 05:53:20.400 align:start position:0%
that means if if this bill were to pass
 
05:53:22.788 --> 05:53:22.798 align:start position:0%
and it increased and I think probably
 
05:53:24.310 --> 05:53:24.320 align:start position:0%
you'd have to say because it gives a
 
05:53:26.230 --> 05:53:26.240 align:start position:0%
different another reason why somebody
 
05:53:28.310 --> 05:53:28.320 align:start position:0%
could be evicted it there probably would
 
05:53:30.670 --> 05:53:30.680 align:start position:0%
be some increase in vacancy rate I don't
 
05:53:32.230 --> 05:53:32.240 align:start position:0%
think it'd be very much but arguably it
 
05:53:33.910 --> 05:53:33.920 align:start position:0%
would have some increase but stop and
 
05:53:36.150 --> 05:53:36.160 align:start position:0%
think about what that means so that
 
05:53:38.868 --> 05:53:38.878 align:start position:0%
means means somebody gets evicted at the
 
05:53:40.350 --> 05:53:40.360 align:start position:0%
end of the lease
 
05:53:43.468 --> 05:53:43.478 align:start position:0%
term so we have a minus one that
 
05:53:43.478 --> 05:53:45.150 align:start position:0%
term so we have a minus one that
person's

05:53:45.150 --> 05:53:45.160 align:start position:0%
person's
 
05:53:47.750 --> 05:53:47.760 align:start position:0%
out under the current under the current
 
05:53:49.548 --> 05:53:49.558 align:start position:0%
system under the current uh vacancy
 
05:53:51.430 --> 05:53:51.440 align:start position:0%
situation isn't it obvious somebody is
 
05:53:53.150 --> 05:53:53.160 align:start position:0%
going to take that up so we have
 
05:53:56.548 --> 05:53:56.558 align:start position:0%
somebody back in how does that increase
 
05:53:58.750 --> 05:53:58.760 align:start position:0%
homelessness is there any reason to
 
05:54:01.948 --> 05:54:01.958 align:start position:0%
believe that the person who is evicted
 
05:54:04.070 --> 05:54:04.080 align:start position:0%
is is like any more likely to become
 
05:54:06.070 --> 05:54:06.080 align:start position:0%
homeless than that the new person that
 
05:54:08.310 --> 05:54:08.320 align:start position:0%
comes in was homeless and is now no
 
05:54:11.030 --> 05:54:11.040 align:start position:0%
longer homeless it doesn't make any
 
05:54:15.150 --> 05:54:15.160 align:start position:0%
sense we all know that the major cause
 
05:54:17.110 --> 05:54:17.120 align:start position:0%
of the home of the homelessness problem
 
05:54:20.190 --> 05:54:20.200 align:start position:0%
and the the unavailability of housing is
 
05:54:23.510 --> 05:54:23.520 align:start position:0%
there's not enough housing how does it
 
05:54:26.788 --> 05:54:26.798 align:start position:0%
help to encourage people to in landlords
 
05:54:30.030 --> 05:54:30.040 align:start position:0%
and investors to to uh give us more
 
05:54:33.350 --> 05:54:33.360 align:start position:0%
housing for rent to make crazy rules
 
05:54:35.910 --> 05:54:35.920 align:start position:0%
like this that just that just impose you
 
05:54:37.270 --> 05:54:37.280 align:start position:0%
know really
 
05:54:39.948 --> 05:54:39.958 align:start position:0%
frankly stupid burdens on the landlord
 
05:54:41.910 --> 05:54:41.920 align:start position:0%
it doesn't make any sense for that
 
05:54:44.868 --> 05:54:44.878 align:start position:0%
reason I urge you to uh press the red
 
05:54:47.548 --> 05:54:47.558 align:start position:0%
button defeat this itl motion so that a
 
05:54:49.270 --> 05:54:49.280 align:start position:0%
more appropriate motion can be made and
 
05:54:51.430 --> 05:54:51.440 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker I would ask for division vote
 
05:54:51.440 --> 05:54:52.670 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker I would ask for division vote
thank

05:54:52.670 --> 05:54:52.680 align:start position:0%
thank
 
05:54:57.350 --> 05:54:57.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:59.948 --> 05:54:59.958 align:start position:0%
Kenny uh thank you Mr
 
05:55:03.670 --> 05:55:03.680 align:start position:0%
Speaker for the last 39 years nearly all
 
05:55:05.350 --> 05:55:05.360 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire tenants have been
 
05:55:07.750 --> 05:55:07.760 align:start position:0%
protected by the statutory requirement
 
05:55:10.590 --> 05:55:10.600 align:start position:0%
that a landlord establish good cause for
 
05:55:12.590 --> 05:55:12.600 align:start position:0%
eviction regardless of whether they have
 
05:55:15.350 --> 05:55:15.360 align:start position:0%
a lease this bill would rip a hole in
 
05:55:17.788 --> 05:55:17.798 align:start position:0%
this vital protection that has served to
 
05:55:19.750 --> 05:55:19.760 align:start position:0%
balance the interests of landlords and
 
05:55:23.190 --> 05:55:23.200 align:start position:0%
tenants for nearly four decades I want
 
05:55:24.868 --> 05:55:24.878 align:start position:0%
to quickly address the idea that this is
 
05:55:26.190 --> 05:55:26.200 align:start position:0%
a simple
 
05:55:28.270 --> 05:55:28.280 align:start position:0%
contract one of the first things I
 
05:55:30.548 --> 05:55:30.558 align:start position:0%
learned in law school in contract law is
 
05:55:32.350 --> 05:55:32.360 align:start position:0%
that it assumes that the parties have
 
05:55:34.788 --> 05:55:34.798 align:start position:0%
roughly equal bargaining power this
 
05:55:37.070 --> 05:55:37.080 align:start position:0%
allows them to negotiate an agement that
 
05:55:40.230 --> 05:55:40.240 align:start position:0%
considers the needs of both parties I've
 
05:55:42.190 --> 05:55:42.200 align:start position:0%
been a renter for quite a long time and
 
05:55:44.670 --> 05:55:44.680 align:start position:0%
to suggest that the power Dynamic is
 
05:55:47.150 --> 05:55:47.160 align:start position:0%
equal in any way is
 
05:55:50.110 --> 05:55:50.120 align:start position:0%
incorrect the landlord sets the terms
 
05:55:52.548 --> 05:55:52.558 align:start position:0%
and the Tenant takes it or leaves it
 
05:55:55.310 --> 05:55:55.320 align:start position:0%
this is even more true now than
 
05:55:58.150 --> 05:55:58.160 align:start position:0%
ever with the historically low rental
 
05:56:00.310 --> 05:56:00.320 align:start position:0%
vacancy of
 
05:56:04.310 --> 05:56:04.320 align:start position:0%
6% what are tenants likely to do take
 
05:56:06.468 --> 05:56:06.478 align:start position:0%
what they are offered because they lack
 
05:56:09.750 --> 05:56:09.760 align:start position:0%
bargaining power because if they say no
 
05:56:11.270 --> 05:56:11.280 align:start position:0%
it is going to be difficult to find
 
05:56:13.868 --> 05:56:13.878 align:start position:0%
another option yet a landlord will have
 
05:56:15.830 --> 05:56:15.840 align:start position:0%
plenty of prospective tenants the
 
05:56:17.110 --> 05:56:17.120 align:start position:0%
numbers don't
 
05:56:19.788 --> 05:56:19.798 align:start position:0%
lie it is important to note at the
 
05:56:21.990 --> 05:56:22.000 align:start position:0%
conclusion of a lease term landlords are
 
05:56:24.670 --> 05:56:24.680 align:start position:0%
not left without any options they can
 
05:56:27.150 --> 05:56:27.160 align:start position:0%
still change the lease terms increase
 
05:56:29.350 --> 05:56:29.360 align:start position:0%
rent decide they no longer want to rent
 
05:56:31.628 --> 05:56:31.638 align:start position:0%
the property uh decide to rent to a
 
05:56:33.628 --> 05:56:33.638 align:start position:0%
family member they can move into the
 
05:56:36.868 --> 05:56:36.878 align:start position:0%
property themselves among other options
 
05:56:39.110 --> 05:56:39.120 align:start position:0%
the only thing that they cannot do is
 
05:56:41.990 --> 05:56:42.000 align:start position:0%
swap one tenant for another without
 
05:56:44.110 --> 05:56:44.120 align:start position:0%
giving any legitimate
 
05:56:46.590 --> 05:56:46.600 align:start position:0%
reason and conversely the only thing a
 
05:56:48.830 --> 05:56:48.840 align:start position:0%
tenant can do at the end of a lease term
 
05:56:50.868 --> 05:56:50.878 align:start position:0%
is decide whether they want to stay and
 
05:56:52.670 --> 05:56:52.680 align:start position:0%
accept the new lease terms imposed by
 
05:56:54.708 --> 05:56:54.718 align:start position:0%
the landlord or not and this includes a
 
05:56:57.190 --> 05:56:57.200 align:start position:0%
rent increase of any
 
05:56:59.990 --> 05:57:00.000 align:start position:0%
amount this is why yes tenants need
 
05:57:03.310 --> 05:57:03.320 align:start position:0%
protection and it does make sense this
 
05:57:05.788 --> 05:57:05.798 align:start position:0%
is why for the past 39 years tenants
 
05:57:07.628 --> 05:57:07.638 align:start position:0%
have been protected from being
 
05:57:10.590 --> 05:57:10.600 align:start position:0%
arbitrarily uh evicted because we are
 
05:57:13.430 --> 05:57:13.440 align:start position:0%
talking about an individual stability
 
05:57:16.390 --> 05:57:16.400 align:start position:0%
the roof over one of our constituents
 
05:57:19.110 --> 05:57:19.120 align:start position:0%
heads and logically Mr Speaker any
 
05:57:21.230 --> 05:57:21.240 align:start position:0%
eviction in this housing market is
 
05:57:24.110 --> 05:57:24.120 align:start position:0%
likely to result in some period of
 
05:57:27.230 --> 05:57:27.240 align:start position:0%
homelessness homelessness already grew
 
05:57:30.230 --> 05:57:30.240 align:start position:0%
55% in New Hampshire between 2022 and
 
05:57:30.240 --> 05:57:32.590 align:start position:0%
55% in New Hampshire between 2022 and
2023

05:57:32.590 --> 05:57:32.600 align:start position:0%
2023
 
05:57:35.708 --> 05:57:35.718 align:start position:0%
55% and uh that is the highest growth
 
05:57:38.510 --> 05:57:38.520 align:start position:0%
Nation wide and for the reasons I've
 
05:57:40.628 --> 05:57:40.638 align:start position:0%
already stated this bill would make an
 
05:57:43.150 --> 05:57:43.160 align:start position:0%
already dire issue much
 
05:57:45.750 --> 05:57:45.760 align:start position:0%
worse by increasing homelessness we
 
05:57:48.350 --> 05:57:48.360 align:start position:0%
would continue to see the disheartening
 
05:57:50.670 --> 05:57:50.680 align:start position:0%
consequences such as disrupting a
 
05:57:53.788 --> 05:57:53.798 align:start position:0%
child's education or causing employment
 
05:57:56.110 --> 05:57:56.120 align:start position:0%
struggles for adults among other
 
05:57:59.670 --> 05:57:59.680 align:start position:0%
issues to conclude we all know that
 
05:58:01.628 --> 05:58:01.638 align:start position:0%
there are times when a landlord needs to
 
05:58:04.548 --> 05:58:04.558 align:start position:0%
evict a tenant and there are many lawful
 
05:58:07.030 --> 05:58:07.040 align:start position:0%
reasons that allow them to do that that
 
05:58:09.948 --> 05:58:09.958 align:start position:0%
they just have to have some legitimate
 
05:58:12.830 --> 05:58:12.840 align:start position:0%
reason because it should not be easy to
 
05:58:15.628 --> 05:58:15.638 align:start position:0%
take away someone's home good cause
 
05:58:17.788 --> 05:58:17.798 align:start position:0%
strikes a balance between protecting
 
05:58:20.670 --> 05:58:20.680 align:start position:0%
property rights of landlords while still
 
05:58:23.270 --> 05:58:23.280 align:start position:0%
offering some stability for
 
05:58:26.150 --> 05:58:26.160 align:start position:0%
tenants therefore Mr Speaker I urge my
 
05:58:28.628 --> 05:58:28.638 align:start position:0%

05:58:30.350 --> 05:58:30.360 align:start position:0%

06:00:40.150 --> 06:00:40.160 align:start position:0%
Speaker if I know that this that the the
 
06:00:42.670 --> 06:00:42.680 align:start position:0%
uh proposed amendment that I would offer
 
06:00:44.750 --> 06:00:44.760 align:start position:0%
I mean I'm sorry the proposed bill that
 
06:00:46.468 --> 06:00:46.478 align:start position:0%
ought to pass if if we defeat this
 
06:00:49.670 --> 06:00:49.680 align:start position:0%
motion does not eliminate good cause as
 
06:00:52.670 --> 06:00:52.680 align:start position:0%
a basis for for removal it simply says
 
06:00:54.628 --> 06:00:54.638 align:start position:0%
that the end of the lease term
 
06:00:57.270 --> 06:00:57.280 align:start position:0%
constitutes good cause and if I know
 
06:00:59.548 --> 06:00:59.558 align:start position:0%
that this bill will correct the law to
 
06:01:01.708 --> 06:01:01.718 align:start position:0%
eliminate the situation whereby a lease
 
06:01:04.030 --> 06:01:04.040 align:start position:0%
provision specifying its term is
 
06:01:06.670 --> 06:01:06.680 align:start position:0%
rendered a nullity for the land Lord but
 
06:01:09.150 --> 06:01:09.160 align:start position:0%
is fully enforceable by the tenant and
 
06:01:10.868 --> 06:01:10.878 align:start position:0%
if I know that the court decision that
 
06:01:13.270 --> 06:01:13.280 align:start position:0%
produced this result violates the
 
06:01:14.868 --> 06:01:14.878 align:start position:0%
contract and property rights of
 
06:01:17.350 --> 06:01:17.360 align:start position:0%
legitimate business people who provide a
 
06:01:19.230 --> 06:01:19.240 align:start position:0%
valuable public service by making
 
06:01:22.190 --> 06:01:22.200 align:start position:0%
housing available to the public and if I
 
06:01:25.110 --> 06:01:25.120 align:start position:0%
know that the law as it now stands
 
06:01:27.708 --> 06:01:27.718 align:start position:0%
reduces the availability of housing to
 
06:01:29.750 --> 06:01:29.760 align:start position:0%
those who are likely to have the most
 
06:01:32.110 --> 06:01:32.120 align:start position:0%
difficulty in securing housing and
 
06:01:34.948 --> 06:01:34.958 align:start position:0%
finally if I know that there is no basis
 
06:01:36.468 --> 06:01:36.478 align:start position:0%
for the claim that this bill will
 
06:01:38.948 --> 06:01:38.958 align:start position:0%
increase homelessness then would I
 
06:01:41.628 --> 06:01:41.638 align:start position:0%
oppose the itl motion by pressing the
 
06:01:44.430 --> 06:01:44.440 align:start position:0%
red button thank you Mr Speaker chair
 
06:01:45.830 --> 06:01:45.840 align:start position:0%

inquiry thank you Mr Speaker Mr Mr
 
06:01:57.150 --> 06:01:57.160 align:start position:0%
Speaker if I know that a contract can be
 
06:01:59.390 --> 06:01:59.400 align:start position:0%
affected by laws and court rulings not
 
06:02:01.510 --> 06:02:01.520 align:start position:0%
written into that document and is
 
06:02:03.310 --> 06:02:03.320 align:start position:0%
therefore governed by more than the
 
06:02:05.670 --> 06:02:05.680 align:start position:0%
words on the page and if I know that
 
06:02:07.750 --> 06:02:07.760 align:start position:0%
those those laws and court rulings are
 
06:02:09.868 --> 06:02:09.878 align:start position:0%
intended to prevent unfair practices
 
06:02:13.030 --> 06:02:13.040 align:start position:0%
between parties on un unequal footing
 
06:02:14.270 --> 06:02:14.280 align:start position:0%
then wouldn't I affirm the committee
 
06:02:16.590 --> 06:02:16.600 align:start position:0%

1283 the hearing on House Bill 1283 was
 
06:13:55.548 --> 06:13:55.558 align:start position:0%
eye openening people are afraid those
 
06:13:59.830 --> 06:13:59.840 align:start position:0%
both for and against the bill those four
 
06:14:02.750 --> 06:14:02.760 align:start position:0%
expressed having unbearable experiences
 
06:14:06.270 --> 06:14:06.280 align:start position:0%
with friends or family or have a fear of
 
06:14:08.990 --> 06:14:09.000 align:start position:0%
suffering themselves at the end stage of
 
06:14:13.110 --> 06:14:13.120 align:start position:0%
a terminal disease those against Express
 
06:14:16.670 --> 06:14:16.680 align:start position:0%
genuine concerns about perhaps being
 
06:14:19.390 --> 06:14:19.400 align:start position:0%
next the bill causing or the bill
 
06:14:22.708 --> 06:14:22.718 align:start position:0%
causing increases in other suicides for
 
06:14:25.990 --> 06:14:26.000 align:start position:0%
example veterans who already have a
 
06:14:29.230 --> 06:14:29.240 align:start position:0%
disproportionately high rate or as
 
06:14:32.708 --> 06:14:32.718 align:start position:0%
evidenced by the testimony and an
 
06:14:35.270 --> 06:14:35.280 align:start position:0%
editorial of a young Stu of young
 
06:14:38.990 --> 06:14:39.000 align:start position:0%
students who felt that passage passage
 
06:14:42.590 --> 06:14:42.600 align:start position:0%
might end up making suicide being an
 
06:14:45.868 --> 06:14:45.878 align:start position:0%
acceptable solution to Life's challenges
 
06:14:48.670 --> 06:14:48.680 align:start position:0%
for their friends something I had not
 
06:14:52.350 --> 06:14:52.360 align:start position:0%
thought of but have now taken to heart
 
06:14:54.868 --> 06:14:54.878 align:start position:0%
would it be acceptable for nursing home
 
06:14:58.628 --> 06:14:58.638 align:start position:0%
patients to feel they are a burden the
 
06:15:01.070 --> 06:15:01.080 align:start position:0%
disabled how about children who are
 
06:15:03.190 --> 06:15:03.200 align:start position:0%
seriously disabled and their parents
 
06:15:06.030 --> 06:15:06.040 align:start position:0%
want to end their suffering the list can
 
06:15:10.430 --> 06:15:10.440 align:start position:0%
go on and yes other civilized countries
 
06:15:13.430 --> 06:15:13.440 align:start position:0%
have dramatically expanded their scope
 
06:15:15.868 --> 06:15:15.878 align:start position:0%
under the name of
 
06:15:20.030 --> 06:15:20.040 align:start position:0%
maid right now California has a bill
 
06:15:24.070 --> 06:15:24.080 align:start position:0%
that dramatically extends their right
 
06:15:25.430 --> 06:15:25.440 align:start position:0%
their assisted
 
06:15:29.910 --> 06:15:29.920 align:start position:0%
suicide this bill concerns me it is not
 
06:15:33.430 --> 06:15:33.440 align:start position:0%
narrowly focused and we are not
 
06:15:36.548 --> 06:15:36.558 align:start position:0%
Oregon these this H there is no
 
06:15:39.750 --> 06:15:39.760 align:start position:0%
residence requirement or limitation will
 
06:15:42.150 --> 06:15:42.160 align:start position:0%
they come from other countries there
 
06:15:45.510 --> 06:15:45.520 align:start position:0%
aren't even guidelines as required by
 
06:15:48.750 --> 06:15:48.760 align:start position:0%
hospice other than the six-month window
 
06:15:52.628 --> 06:15:52.638 align:start position:0%
to death who determines that someone who
 
06:15:56.030 --> 06:15:56.040 align:start position:0%
has not treated you at all a complete
 
06:15:59.110 --> 06:15:59.120 align:start position:0%
stranger who reviews your medical record
 
06:16:01.910 --> 06:16:01.920 align:start position:0%
that is provided by whom who provides
 
06:16:03.350 --> 06:16:03.360 align:start position:0%
that medical
 
06:16:06.150 --> 06:16:06.160 align:start position:0%
record there is no no requirement for
 
06:16:07.670 --> 06:16:07.680 align:start position:0%
your treating
 
06:16:09.868 --> 06:16:09.878 align:start position:0%
physician the one who has worked with
 
06:16:11.910 --> 06:16:11.920 align:start position:0%
you throughout your illness to be
 
06:16:16.070 --> 06:16:16.080 align:start position:0%
involved at all hospice mandates their
 
06:16:18.628 --> 06:16:18.638 align:start position:0%
involvement honestly to have a gastric
 
06:16:21.270 --> 06:16:21.280 align:start position:0%
bypass one must have to ensure they are
 
06:16:22.948 --> 06:16:22.958 align:start position:0%
medically psychologically and
 
06:16:25.430 --> 06:16:25.440 align:start position:0%
cognitively ready this bill doesn't
 
06:16:29.628 --> 06:16:29.638 align:start position:0%
require any of that and my life in a
 
06:16:32.430 --> 06:16:32.440 align:start position:0%
peaceful manner is stated for your
 
06:16:35.350 --> 06:16:35.360 align:start position:0%
termination of life in this bill yet
 
06:16:39.868 --> 06:16:39.878 align:start position:0%
this holds no guarantee even Oregon yes
 
06:16:43.310 --> 06:16:43.320 align:start position:0%
Oregon stated that there are distressing
 
06:16:45.548 --> 06:16:45.558 align:start position:0%
complications from the ingestions of
 
06:16:48.190 --> 06:16:48.200 align:start position:0%
these drugs and
 
06:16:50.990 --> 06:16:51.000 align:start position:0%
14.8% of patients had difficulty
 
06:16:54.628 --> 06:16:54.638 align:start position:0%
swallowing or experienced regurgitation
 
06:16:58.030 --> 06:16:58.040 align:start position:0%
seizures or even regained
 
06:17:00.990 --> 06:17:01.000 align:start position:0%
Consciousness no witness is required
 
06:17:04.270 --> 06:17:04.280 align:start position:0%
what happens to these lethal drugs if a
 
06:17:07.230 --> 06:17:07.240 align:start position:0%
patient is decides not to take them or
 
06:17:09.270 --> 06:17:09.280 align:start position:0%
dies before they use
 
06:17:13.708 --> 06:17:13.718 align:start position:0%
them there is a page and a half
 
06:17:17.788 --> 06:17:17.798 align:start position:0%
584 words protecting the health care
 
06:17:20.548 --> 06:17:20.558 align:start position:0%
provider and the health care
 
06:17:24.150 --> 06:17:24.160 align:start position:0%
entity if this is such a comprehensive
 
06:17:28.310 --> 06:17:28.320 align:start position:0%
and thorough Bill why is that necessary
 
06:17:32.030 --> 06:17:32.040 align:start position:0%
why do they need such extensive
 
06:17:35.948 --> 06:17:35.958 align:start position:0%
protection a big problem no Reporting
 
06:17:39.270 --> 06:17:39.280 align:start position:0%
System there is no way to tell how many
 
06:17:42.150 --> 06:17:42.160 align:start position:0%
actually received the cocktail and how
 
06:17:44.948 --> 06:17:44.958 align:start position:0%
many used it California states that
 
06:17:48.670 --> 06:17:48.680 align:start position:0%
Under reporting and abuse of the law is
 
06:17:52.030 --> 06:17:52.040 align:start position:0%
covered up by the lack of requirement a
 
06:17:54.948 --> 06:17:54.958 align:start position:0%
requirement that should be there now
 
06:17:57.510 --> 06:17:57.520 align:start position:0%
there's another red flag to consider
 
06:17:59.670 --> 06:17:59.680 align:start position:0%
alol the law would state that an
 
06:18:02.070 --> 06:18:02.080 align:start position:0%
individual's request does not arrive
 
06:18:05.230 --> 06:18:05.240 align:start position:0%
from coercion there is no penalty for
 
06:18:10.070 --> 06:18:10.080 align:start position:0%
this but yet if any person knowingly
 
06:18:13.270 --> 06:18:13.280 align:start position:0%
does anything with the intent to cause
 
06:18:16.310 --> 06:18:16.320 align:start position:0%
interference with or prevent a person
 
06:18:18.868 --> 06:18:18.878 align:start position:0%
from following through with ending their
 
06:18:22.230 --> 06:18:22.240 align:start position:0%
life it is a class B
 
06:18:26.030 --> 06:18:26.040 align:start position:0%
felony in addition this bill attempts to
 
06:18:28.150 --> 06:18:28.160 align:start position:0%
dictate what insurance companies are
 
06:18:30.830 --> 06:18:30.840 align:start position:0%
required to pay for life insurance no
 
06:18:33.430 --> 06:18:33.440 align:start position:0%
matter what the terms of their policy
 
06:18:35.830 --> 06:18:35.840 align:start position:0%
are that they agreed to
 
06:18:38.708 --> 06:18:38.718 align:start position:0%
I could continue with many more
 
06:18:41.390 --> 06:18:41.400 align:start position:0%
concerns and I want you to know that I
 
06:18:44.430 --> 06:18:44.440 align:start position:0%
have spoken to two physicians at length
 
06:18:46.990 --> 06:18:47.000 align:start position:0%
two lawyers and an insurance agent who
 
06:18:50.510 --> 06:18:50.520 align:start position:0%
share some or all of my points on this
 
06:18:53.468 --> 06:18:53.478 align:start position:0%
bill I know that you there are many of
 
06:18:55.670 --> 06:18:55.680 align:start position:0%
you and your constituents that feel
 
06:18:58.628 --> 06:18:58.638 align:start position:0%
strongly about the intent of this bill
 
06:19:01.468 --> 06:19:01.478 align:start position:0%
but we're not talking but we're talking
 
06:19:04.868 --> 06:19:04.878 align:start position:0%
about ending an individual's life we are
 
06:19:09.070 --> 06:19:09.080 align:start position:0%
certainly owe them a bill that is clear
 
06:19:12.708 --> 06:19:12.718 align:start position:0%
concise and not open to misinformation
 
06:19:17.110 --> 06:19:17.120 align:start position:0%
or unintentional or intentional
 
06:19:19.868 --> 06:19:19.878 align:start position:0%
additions I have been asked to read this
 
06:19:22.788 --> 06:19:22.798 align:start position:0%
from a constituent this bill sends a
 
06:19:25.230 --> 06:19:25.240 align:start position:0%
message that we no longer are saying
 
06:19:27.990 --> 06:19:28.000 align:start position:0%
that we should protect all lives from
 
06:19:31.110 --> 06:19:31.120 align:start position:0%
suicide it's the message that some lives
 
06:19:34.788 --> 06:19:34.798 align:start position:0%
are simply not worth it is that the
 
06:19:37.788 --> 06:19:37.798 align:start position:0%
message we really want to spend send
 
06:19:40.868 --> 06:19:40.878 align:start position:0%
especially to our youth please press the
 
06:19:43.510 --> 06:19:43.520 align:start position:0%
red button and let's give the people a
 
06:19:46.948 --> 06:19:46.958 align:start position:0%
better option A better Bill thank you

choire thank you Mr
 
06:19:58.708 --> 06:19:58.718 align:start position:0%
Speaker am I hearing that the doctor has
 
06:20:00.990 --> 06:20:01.000 align:start position:0%
been treating you has no involvement in
 
06:20:03.708 --> 06:20:03.718 align:start position:0%
this process and there is no designated
 
06:20:05.990 --> 06:20:06.000 align:start position:0%
chain of command for the individual's
 
06:20:07.590 --> 06:20:07.600 align:start position:0%
records to be given to the total
 
06:20:09.910 --> 06:20:09.920 align:start position:0%
strangers that will be who making the
 
06:20:14.590 --> 06:20:14.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:18.230 --> 06:20:18.240 align:start position:0%
decision yes that's absolutely true your
 
06:20:21.510 --> 06:20:21.520 align:start position:0%
doctor who has been treating you has no
 
06:20:24.910 --> 06:20:24.920 align:start position:0%
involvement in ending your life other
 
06:20:28.910 --> 06:20:28.920 align:start position:0%
than a medical record not from him
 
06:20:33.628 --> 06:20:33.638 align:start position:0%
necessarily or her is to be transferred
 
06:20:36.708 --> 06:20:36.718 align:start position:0%
to the who's making the decision for you
 
06:20:39.030 --> 06:20:39.040 align:start position:0%
to be allowed there's no chain of
 
06:20:41.750 --> 06:20:41.760 align:start position:0%
command there's no saying what medical
 
06:20:43.868 --> 06:20:43.878 align:start position:0%
records you get it could have been from
 
06:20:45.750 --> 06:20:45.760 align:start position:0%
your primary care and not even your
 
06:20:45.760 --> 06:20:50.750 align:start position:0%
your primary care and not even your
treating

06:20:50.750 --> 06:20:50.760 align:start position:0%

legalizing assisted suicide also
 
06:21:24.270 --> 06:21:24.280 align:start position:0%
referred to as Medical Aid in dying I
 
06:21:26.150 --> 06:21:26.160 align:start position:0%
would like to draw the attention of the
 
06:21:27.910 --> 06:21:27.920 align:start position:0%
potential impacts this bill could have
 
06:21:31.670 --> 06:21:31.680 align:start position:0%
on the disabled and other marginalized
 
06:21:34.788 --> 06:21:34.798 align:start position:0%
residents I was 19 years old the second
 
06:21:38.030 --> 06:21:38.040 align:start position:0%
time I attempted to die by Suicide I had
 
06:21:41.150 --> 06:21:41.160 align:start position:0%
just been diagnosed with a chronic but
 
06:21:43.670 --> 06:21:43.680 align:start position:0%
not life-threatening illness I had
 
06:21:46.830 --> 06:21:46.840 align:start position:0%
rapidly lost 70% of my hearing in the
 
06:21:49.868 --> 06:21:49.878 align:start position:0%
middle of completing a music degree and
 
06:21:53.070 --> 06:21:53.080 align:start position:0%
I was struggling with untreated anorexia
 
06:21:56.230 --> 06:21:56.240 align:start position:0%
that was taking a serious toll on my
 
06:21:59.270 --> 06:21:59.280 align:start position:0%
health at my intake appointment with a
 
06:22:01.708 --> 06:22:01.718 align:start position:0%
new therapist a few days after my
 
06:22:05.190 --> 06:22:05.200 align:start position:0%
attempt I explained my situation and the
 
06:22:06.910 --> 06:22:06.920 align:start position:0%
hopelessness I was

feeling she nodded along then looked me
 
06:22:13.150 --> 06:22:13.160 align:start position:0%
in the eyes and said something I will
 
06:22:13.160 --> 06:22:14.110 align:start position:0%
in the eyes and said something I will
never

06:22:14.110 --> 06:22:14.120 align:start position:0%
never
 
06:22:17.750 --> 06:22:17.760 align:start position:0%
forget I would probably kill myself if I
 
06:22:17.760 --> 06:22:19.468 align:start position:0%
forget I would probably kill myself if I
were

06:22:19.468 --> 06:22:19.478 align:start position:0%
were
 
06:22:22.310 --> 06:22:22.320 align:start position:0%
you she wasn't the first person to say
 
06:22:24.070 --> 06:22:24.080 align:start position:0%
this to me as I started becoming more
 
06:22:26.788 --> 06:22:26.798 align:start position:0%
noticeably disabled but she was probably
 
06:22:29.270 --> 06:22:29.280 align:start position:0%
the last person I expected to do
 
06:22:32.750 --> 06:22:32.760 align:start position:0%
so now that I work in Disability Policy
 
06:22:35.910 --> 06:22:35.920 align:start position:0%
nothing surprises me I hear stories from
 
06:22:38.310 --> 06:22:38.320 align:start position:0%
other disabled people about doctors
 
06:22:40.990 --> 06:22:41.000 align:start position:0%
pressuring them to sign dnrs because
 
06:22:42.830 --> 06:22:42.840 align:start position:0%
they are assumed to have a low quality
 
06:22:45.350 --> 06:22:45.360 align:start position:0%
of life due to their
 
06:22:47.788 --> 06:22:47.798 align:start position:0%
disability I get messages on social
 
06:22:49.990 --> 06:22:50.000 align:start position:0%
media from people asking me to how to
 
06:22:52.230 --> 06:22:52.240 align:start position:0%
advocate for appropriate pain management
 
06:22:53.990 --> 06:22:54.000 align:start position:0%
when their doctors don't believe the
 
06:22:55.390 --> 06:22:55.400 align:start position:0%
amount of pain they're
 
06:22:59.190 --> 06:22:59.200 align:start position:0%
in I pour over story after the story of
 
06:23:01.230 --> 06:23:01.240 align:start position:0%
people like Michael Hixon in Tinsley
 
06:23:03.628 --> 06:23:03.638 align:start position:0%
Lewis having treatment withdrawn
 
06:23:06.190 --> 06:23:06.200 align:start position:0%
withheld or threatened because of the
 
06:23:07.830 --> 06:23:07.840 align:start position:0%
pervasive view that it's better to be
 
06:23:09.990 --> 06:23:10.000 align:start position:0%
dead than
 
06:23:12.750 --> 06:23:12.760 align:start position:0%
disabled this is why I am critical of
 
06:23:14.590 --> 06:23:14.600 align:start position:0%
policies that are biased toward ending
 
06:23:16.590 --> 06:23:16.600 align:start position:0%
the lives of people with significant
 
06:23:18.310 --> 06:23:18.320 align:start position:0%
disabilities rather than towards
 
06:23:21.070 --> 06:23:21.080 align:start position:0%
preserving them policies like legally

discussion around terminal illness in
 
06:23:29.750 --> 06:23:29.760 align:start position:0%
general has historically been framed as
 
06:23:33.150 --> 06:23:33.160 align:start position:0%
an issue for older adults young people
 
06:23:34.788 --> 06:23:34.798 align:start position:0%

treatment for disabled people not only
 
06:24:15.468 --> 06:24:15.478 align:start position:0%
because we are human beings who deserve

care but also because the odds of

make this happen a system where death
 
06:25:26.868 --> 06:25:26.878 align:start position:0%
seems like the best or only option for
 
06:25:29.350 --> 06:25:29.360 align:start position:0%
the most marginalized patients is not a
 
06:25:31.750 --> 06:25:31.760 align:start position:0%
system that needs a legal Avenue for
 
06:25:35.310 --> 06:25:35.320 align:start position:0%
doctors to help us die as my colleague
 
06:25:37.590 --> 06:25:37.600 align:start position:0%

Anita Cameron has written disabled

people need supports to live not tools
 
06:25:48.948 --> 06:25:48.958 align:start position:0%
to die a policy of assist to suicide is
 
06:25:52.510 --> 06:25:52.520 align:start position:0%
not an Avenue for Bly autonomy or Choice
 
06:25:54.670 --> 06:25:54.680 align:start position:0%
it is yet another tool that can be used
 
06:25:57.390 --> 06:25:57.400 align:start position:0%
to deny care to those who need it most
 
06:25:57.400 --> 06:26:01.430 align:start position:0%

06:32:15.708 --> 06:32:15.718 align:start position:0%
many people including some of you wish
 
06:32:18.030 --> 06:32:18.040 align:start position:0%
to have greater control over how their
 
06:32:21.548 --> 06:32:21.558 align:start position:0%
life ends I applaud the fact that this
 
06:32:25.030 --> 06:32:25.040 align:start position:0%
has been treated as a nonpartisan issue
 
06:32:27.150 --> 06:32:27.160 align:start position:0%
I am speaking to you today not as a
 
06:32:31.030 --> 06:32:31.040 align:start position:0%
Democrat but as a son and as a

she enjoyed defeating my father in golf
 
06:32:49.628 --> 06:32:49.638 align:start position:0%
something he very rarely
 
06:32:51.708 --> 06:32:51.718 align:start position:0%
acknowledged later in her life she
 
06:32:53.350 --> 06:32:53.360 align:start position:0%
suffered complications from heart
 
06:32:55.590 --> 06:32:55.600 align:start position:0%
surgery that resulted in both of her

kidneys failing after spending months
 
06:33:01.030 --> 06:33:01.040 align:start position:0%
going to and spending hours connected to
 
06:33:04.628 --> 06:33:04.638 align:start position:0%
a dialysis machine she decided that that
 
06:33:06.708 --> 06:33:06.718 align:start position:0%
really was not for her and she stopped
 
06:33:09.190 --> 06:33:09.200 align:start position:0%
going to those appointments she passed
 
06:33:11.548 --> 06:33:11.558 align:start position:0%
away shortly thereafter and my sister
 
06:33:14.190 --> 06:33:14.200 align:start position:0%

remembering and recalling an

why because these laws are inherently

06:35:29.350 --> 06:35:29.360 align:start position:0%
at a distinct disadvantage in accessing

appropriate levels of care and support
 
06:35:34.628 --> 06:35:34.638 align:start position:0%
while we have made good progress in our
 
06:35:38.070 --> 06:35:38.080 align:start position:0%
country and in our state do not forget
 
06:35:39.830 --> 06:35:39.840 align:start position:0%
that the federal government has yet to
 
06:35:41.910 --> 06:35:41.920 align:start position:0%
fully fund the individuals with

the those individuals and their families
 
06:36:06.868 --> 06:36:06.878 align:start position:0%

the

population some will also claim that the
 
06:36:13.190 --> 06:36:13.200 align:start position:0%
intent of this bill is to provide
 
06:36:16.310 --> 06:36:16.320 align:start position:0%
greater bodily autonomy to granted sters
 
06:36:18.910 --> 06:36:18.920 align:start position:0%
consistent with our Live Free or Die
 
06:36:22.310 --> 06:36:22.320 align:start position:0%
culture in opposing this bill I would
 
06:36:24.990 --> 06:36:25.000 align:start position:0%
suggest that before we focus on the word
 
06:36:27.990 --> 06:36:28.000 align:start position:0%
die in that motto we focus more on the
 
06:36:31.388 --> 06:36:31.398 align:start position:0%
word live we need to fix the huge
 
06:36:33.590 --> 06:36:33.600 align:start position:0%
inequities in our health care and social
 
06:36:35.830 --> 06:36:35.840 align:start position:0%
Services System that vulnerable
 
06:36:38.350 --> 06:36:38.360 align:start position:0%
populations experience so that they are
 
06:36:40.628 --> 06:36:40.638 align:start position:0%
able to enjoy the greater autonomy of
 
06:36:43.230 --> 06:36:43.240 align:start position:0%
their bodies that most of us already
 
06:36:45.468 --> 06:36:45.478 align:start position:0%
enjoy and so that they can lead the rich
 
06:36:47.190 --> 06:36:47.200 align:start position:0%
and fulfilling life that they are
 
06:36:49.868 --> 06:36:49.878 align:start position:0%
entitled to before they
 
06:36:53.190 --> 06:36:53.200 align:start position:0%
die as a parent of a certain age and
 
06:36:55.270 --> 06:36:55.280 align:start position:0%
after talking with parents of other
 
06:36:57.030 --> 06:36:57.040 align:start position:0%
atypical abled
 
06:36:59.548 --> 06:36:59.558 align:start position:0%
individuals the number one question on
 
06:37:02.548 --> 06:37:02.558 align:start position:0%
our minds is what will happen to my
 
06:37:04.628 --> 06:37:04.638 align:start position:0%
child after I'm
 
06:37:07.510 --> 06:37:07.520 align:start position:0%
gone whether we want to admit it or not
 
06:37:10.070 --> 06:37:10.080 align:start position:0%
there continues to be a stigmatization
 
06:37:12.868 --> 06:37:12.878 align:start position:0%
of disability in our society it is one
 
06:37:14.948 --> 06:37:14.958 align:start position:0%
of the last remaining barriers to
 
06:37:17.548 --> 06:37:17.558 align:start position:0%
Justice and equality for all that we
 
06:37:20.030 --> 06:37:20.040 align:start position:0%
still need to address for all that we
 
06:37:22.468 --> 06:37:22.478 align:start position:0%
need to address with that as our
 
06:37:24.830 --> 06:37:24.840 align:start position:0%
cultural bias there is a concern that
 
06:37:28.070 --> 06:37:28.080 align:start position:0%
our loved ones may feel pressured or
 
06:37:31.030 --> 06:37:31.040 align:start position:0%
coerced intentionally or unintentionally
 
06:37:33.868 --> 06:37:33.878 align:start position:0%
into ending their lives prematurely with
 
06:37:36.110 --> 06:37:36.120 align:start position:0%
no one looking out for their best
 
06:37:38.270 --> 06:37:38.280 align:start position:0%
interests I have concerns about the
 
06:37:41.708 --> 06:37:41.718 align:start position:0%
safeguards and protections in hb1 1283
 
06:37:43.628 --> 06:37:43.638 align:start position:0%
to ensure this does not happen to people
 
06:37:43.638 --> 06:37:44.628 align:start position:0%
to ensure this does not happen to people
with

06:37:44.628 --> 06:37:44.638 align:start position:0%
with
 
06:37:46.830 --> 06:37:46.840 align:start position:0%
disabilities the bill requires that
 
06:37:48.948 --> 06:37:48.958 align:start position:0%
someone who is considering ending their
 
06:37:51.830 --> 06:37:51.840 align:start position:0%
life must be evaluated by a mental
 
06:37:51.840 --> 06:37:53.510 align:start position:0%

health
 
06:37:55.670 --> 06:37:55.680 align:start position:0%
professional but there is nothing in the
 
06:37:58.468 --> 06:37:58.478 align:start position:0%
bill that mandates that someone with
 
06:38:00.948 --> 06:38:00.958 align:start position:0%
specific expertise working with
 
06:38:02.590 --> 06:38:02.600 align:start position:0%
individuals diagnosed with a

developmental dis ability such as autism
 
06:38:08.110 --> 06:38:08.120 align:start position:0%
must be involved in the assessment of an
 
06:38:10.270 --> 06:38:10.280 align:start position:0%
individual with that
 
06:38:12.590 --> 06:38:12.600 align:start position:0%
diagnosis unless you have worked closely
 
06:38:14.830 --> 06:38:14.840 align:start position:0%
with individuals who are on the autistic
 
06:38:16.990 --> 06:38:17.000 align:start position:0%
Spectrum you will not know how to
 
06:38:19.510 --> 06:38:19.520 align:start position:0%
connect with them on a meaningful basis
 
06:38:22.030 --> 06:38:22.040 align:start position:0%
and how to interpret answers they give
 
06:38:23.788 --> 06:38:23.798 align:start position:0%
to the questions they are
 
06:38:26.430 --> 06:38:26.440 align:start position:0%
asked considerable space is spent in the

06:39:03.388 --> 06:39:03.398 align:start position:0%
coached to voluntarily request or self
 
06:39:05.350 --> 06:39:05.360 align:start position:0%
administer a terminal prescription for
 
06:39:08.110 --> 06:39:08.120 align:start position:0%
the purposes of ending their life there
 
06:39:09.430 --> 06:39:09.440 align:start position:0%
is language in the bill that
 
06:39:12.510 --> 06:39:12.520 align:start position:0%
specifically prevents the individual's
 
06:39:16.030 --> 06:39:16.040 align:start position:0%
surrogate decision maker Guardian Health
 
06:39:18.110 --> 06:39:18.120 align:start position:0%
Care proxy or attorney in fact for
 
06:39:20.788 --> 06:39:20.798 align:start position:0%
Health Care from initia initiating a
 
06:39:22.830 --> 06:39:22.840 align:start position:0%
request for medical assistance and
 
06:39:25.548 --> 06:39:25.558 align:start position:0%
dying that's a pretty extensive list
 
06:39:27.590 --> 06:39:27.600 align:start position:0%
which probably includes at least one of
 
06:39:29.868 --> 06:39:29.878 align:start position:0%
the people my wife and I will designate
 
06:39:33.548 --> 06:39:33.558 align:start position:0%
to help our son after we are gone if
 
06:39:35.750 --> 06:39:35.760 align:start position:0%
they can't be involved in the decision
 
06:39:37.548 --> 06:39:37.558 align:start position:0%
then who will help him if someone
 
06:39:40.310 --> 06:39:40.320 align:start position:0%
suggests to him that he has reached a
 
06:39:43.150 --> 06:39:43.160 align:start position:0%
point where he should end his life my
 
06:39:45.150 --> 06:39:45.160 align:start position:0%
experience has been that most
 
06:39:47.230 --> 06:39:47.240 align:start position:0%
individuals who have been diagnosed with
 
06:39:49.788 --> 06:39:49.798 align:start position:0%
a developmental disability and received
 
06:39:52.388 --> 06:39:52.398 align:start position:0%
ongoing supports from others for most of
 
06:39:55.708 --> 06:39:55.718 align:start position:0%
their lives are very trusting and could
 
06:39:58.628 --> 06:39:58.638 align:start position:0%
thus be easily manipulated by anyone
 
06:40:00.830 --> 06:40:00.840 align:start position:0%
claiming to be their
 
06:40:03.948 --> 06:40:03.958 align:start position:0%
friend how we each vote on this bill
 
06:40:05.990 --> 06:40:06.000 align:start position:0%
will be a deeply personal decision we
 
06:40:09.030 --> 06:40:09.040 align:start position:0%
each have to make I have struggled with
 
06:40:11.310 --> 06:40:11.320 align:start position:0%
it since I first became aware of this
 
06:40:14.468 --> 06:40:14.478 align:start position:0%
bill while on the one hand I would like
 
06:40:16.948 --> 06:40:16.958 align:start position:0%
everyone to have the same option my
 
06:40:19.030 --> 06:40:19.040 align:start position:0%
mother chose to end her
 
06:40:22.270 --> 06:40:22.280 align:start position:0%
life because of my son and the thousands
 
06:40:25.350 --> 06:40:25.360 align:start position:0%
of others like him in our state I cannot
 
06:40:28.230 --> 06:40:28.240 align:start position:0%
vote in favor of it I hope the
 
06:40:30.070 --> 06:40:30.080 align:start position:0%
perspective I have shared with you will
 
06:40:32.548 --> 06:40:32.558 align:start position:0%
help you in the decision you will need
 
06:40:33.948 --> 06:40:33.958 align:start position:0%
to make
 
06:40:35.830 --> 06:40:35.840 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker and I would like to
 
06:40:39.270 --> 06:40:39.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:40:41.708 --> 06:40:41.718 align:start position:0%
vote representative margerie Smith is
 
06:40:55.750 --> 06:40:55.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:40:58.990 --> 06:40:59.000 align:start position:0%
report thank you Mr
 
06:41:02.468 --> 06:41:02.478 align:start position:0%
Speaker I'd like to begin by saying that
 
06:41:04.430 --> 06:41:04.440 align:start position:0%
I agree
 
06:41:07.310 --> 06:41:07.320 align:start position:0%
completely with the words of my
 
06:41:12.030 --> 06:41:12.040 align:start position:0%
colleague from Hampton he made a very
 
06:41:14.990 --> 06:41:15.000 align:start position:0%
strong argument for the fact that we as
 
06:41:17.948 --> 06:41:17.958 align:start position:0%
a society and as a
 
06:41:21.388 --> 06:41:21.398 align:start position:0%
legislature have not done all that we
 
06:41:25.628 --> 06:41:25.638 align:start position:0%
could or should do to make sure that we
 
06:41:30.270 --> 06:41:30.280 align:start position:0%
have guaranteed equal access to health
 
06:41:34.190 --> 06:41:34.200 align:start position:0%
education housing for people with
 
06:41:38.548 --> 06:41:38.558 align:start position:0%
disabilities for people of color for
 
06:41:41.750 --> 06:41:41.760 align:start position:0%
other groups that are not like the
 
06:41:45.350 --> 06:41:45.360 align:start position:0%
majority he is absolutely
 
06:41:49.670 --> 06:41:49.680 align:start position:0%
correct where I differ however is that
 
06:41:53.350 --> 06:41:53.360 align:start position:0%
this bill has nothing to do with that
 
06:41:56.230 --> 06:41:56.240 align:start position:0%
it's an entirely different subject we
 
06:41:57.548 --> 06:41:57.558 align:start position:0%
should leave
 
06:42:01.110 --> 06:42:01.120 align:start position:0%
here committed to do more for others
 
06:42:04.270 --> 06:42:04.280 align:start position:0%
than we are doing now but has nothing to
 
06:42:06.750 --> 06:42:06.760 align:start position:0%
do with this
 
06:42:10.350 --> 06:42:10.360 align:start position:0%
bill in the disperate world that we
 
06:42:14.910 --> 06:42:14.920 align:start position:0%
occupy we all have two things in common
 
06:42:16.270 --> 06:42:16.280 align:start position:0%
we are
 
06:42:18.788 --> 06:42:18.798 align:start position:0%
born and we
 
06:42:22.388 --> 06:42:22.398 align:start position:0%
die in my earliest years in the
 
06:42:25.190 --> 06:42:25.200 align:start position:0%
legislature longtime representative
 
06:42:28.628 --> 06:42:28.638 align:start position:0%
Marian copenhaver along with others
 
06:42:31.310 --> 06:42:31.320 align:start position:0%
sponsored a bill on this very subject
 
06:42:34.230 --> 06:42:34.240 align:start position:0%
that came to the Judiciary Committee
 
06:42:36.670 --> 06:42:36.680 align:start position:0%
that was more than 25 years
 
06:42:40.670 --> 06:42:40.680 align:start position:0%
ago but the shock that I experienced in
 
06:42:44.070 --> 06:42:44.080 align:start position:0%
that hearing has stayed with me all this
 
06:42:48.230 --> 06:42:48.240 align:start position:0%
time caring competent committed
 
06:42:50.910 --> 06:42:50.920 align:start position:0%
Physicians spoke of how they felt
 
06:42:53.990 --> 06:42:54.000 align:start position:0%
powerless to help their patients who
 
06:42:55.990 --> 06:42:56.000 align:start position:0%
were nearing the ends of their the end
 
06:42:58.388 --> 06:42:58.398 align:start position:0%
of their lives and experiencing
 
06:43:02.670 --> 06:43:02.680 align:start position:0%
unbearable pain they were concerned that
 
06:43:06.388 --> 06:43:06.398 align:start position:0%
if they use drugs to minimize the pain
 
06:43:10.030 --> 06:43:10.040 align:start position:0%
they would be charged with a crime that
 
06:43:13.670 --> 06:43:13.680 align:start position:0%
same concern was expressed by dedicated
 
06:43:15.910 --> 06:43:15.920 align:start position:0%
concerned members of the burgeoning
 
06:43:19.110 --> 06:43:19.120 align:start position:0%
hospice community and by patients
 
06:43:22.750 --> 06:43:22.760 align:start position:0%
nearing the end of their lives and their
 
06:43:27.070 --> 06:43:27.080 align:start position:0%
families since then at regular intervals
 
06:43:30.070 --> 06:43:30.080 align:start position:0%
bills addressing the issues of end of
 
06:43:33.190 --> 06:43:33.200 align:start position:0%
life have appeared some to form study
 
06:43:36.590 --> 06:43:36.600 align:start position:0%
committees some to take specific
 
06:43:40.590 --> 06:43:40.600 align:start position:0%
action for example hospice and pallative
 
06:43:43.310 --> 06:43:43.320 align:start position:0%
Care have developed significantly in
 
06:43:46.310 --> 06:43:46.320 align:start position:0%
this quarter Century some passed one
 
06:43:49.708 --> 06:43:49.718 align:start position:0%
house or another some passed both only
 
06:43:53.548 --> 06:43:53.558 align:start position:0%
to die on the governor's
 
06:43:59.310 --> 06:43:59.320 align:start position:0%
desk now we like to be first in the
 
06:44:03.230 --> 06:44:03.240 align:start position:0%
nation and we certainly know that first
 
06:44:06.430 --> 06:44:06.440 align:start position:0%
in the nation primaries are incredibly
 
06:44:10.510 --> 06:44:10.520 align:start position:0%
important to us not many proposals in
 
06:44:14.590 --> 06:44:14.600 align:start position:0%
this body get a unanimous vote but
 
06:44:18.110 --> 06:44:18.120 align:start position:0%
sometimes being first in the nation is
 
06:44:26.190 --> 06:44:26.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:44:26.200 --> 06:44:27.990 align:start position:0%
 
goal

06:44:27.990 --> 06:44:28.000 align:start position:0%
goal
 
06:44:32.150 --> 06:44:32.160 align:start position:0%
what we have to understand is that we
 
06:44:33.948 --> 06:44:33.958 align:start position:0%
have waited
 
06:44:38.708 --> 06:44:38.718 align:start position:0%
26 years since Oregon
 
06:44:38.718 --> 06:44:41.230 align:start position:0%
26 years since Oregon
began

06:44:41.230 --> 06:44:41.240 align:start position:0%
began
 
06:44:45.430 --> 06:44:45.440 align:start position:0%
its uh Medical Aid and dying program and
 
06:44:47.990 --> 06:44:48.000 align:start position:0%
since then they now a total of 10 states
 
06:44:51.070 --> 06:44:51.080 align:start position:0%
in the district of Colombia we have
 
06:44:53.788 --> 06:44:53.798 align:start position:0%
watched what went on in those States we
 
06:44:56.430 --> 06:44:56.440 align:start position:0%
have monitored the results we have seen
 
06:45:01.388 --> 06:45:01.398 align:start position:0%
where there were problems we very very
 
06:45:05.948 --> 06:45:05.958 align:start position:0%
carefully decide Ed how to construct a a
 
06:45:09.350 --> 06:45:09.360 align:start position:0%
conservative bill that learned its
 
06:45:11.990 --> 06:45:12.000 align:start position:0%
lessons by our not being first in the
 
06:45:14.430 --> 06:45:14.440 align:start position:0%
nation but by our
 
06:45:18.948 --> 06:45:18.958 align:start position:0%
waiting this bill is about options it
 
06:45:23.030 --> 06:45:23.040 align:start position:0%
offers one option to join others that
 
06:45:27.110 --> 06:45:27.120 align:start position:0%
are available in our laws governing the
 
06:45:29.230 --> 06:45:29.240 align:start position:0%
end of
 
06:45:33.070 --> 06:45:33.080 align:start position:0%
life the bill the which is the amendment
 
06:45:36.070 --> 06:45:36.080 align:start position:0%
which is in the calendar is very long
 
06:45:39.190 --> 06:45:39.200 align:start position:0%
and if you all are as busy as we are in
 
06:45:42.990 --> 06:45:43.000 align:start position:0%
judiciary you haven't had a chance to
 
06:45:46.070 --> 06:45:46.080 align:start position:0%
read the entire Amendment since it
 
06:45:49.350 --> 06:45:49.360 align:start position:0%
wasn't in your committee I will say also
 
06:45:52.750 --> 06:45:52.760 align:start position:0%
that the reports in the calendar are
 
06:45:56.110 --> 06:45:56.120 align:start position:0%
also long because it's a complicated
 
06:45:58.948 --> 06:45:58.958 align:start position:0%
issue perhaps you've had time to read
 
06:46:01.910 --> 06:46:01.920 align:start position:0%
those but let me give you a quick
 
06:46:01.920 --> 06:46:03.468 align:start position:0%
those but let me give you a quick
summary

06:46:03.468 --> 06:46:03.478 align:start position:0%
summary
 
06:46:06.270 --> 06:46:06.280 align:start position:0%
under this bill the request must be
 
06:46:10.510 --> 06:46:10.520 align:start position:0%
written by the terminally ill person and
 
06:46:12.910 --> 06:46:12.920 align:start position:0%
it must be signed in front of two
 
06:46:15.670 --> 06:46:15.680 align:start position:0%
witnesses one of whom at least can't be
 
06:46:17.388 --> 06:46:17.398 align:start position:0%
related in any
 
06:46:21.628 --> 06:46:21.638 align:start position:0%
way two Health Care Providers must
 
06:46:24.990 --> 06:46:25.000 align:start position:0%
evaluate the terminally ill person
 
06:46:27.788 --> 06:46:27.798 align:start position:0%
independently to confirm that they are
 
06:46:31.708 --> 06:46:31.718 align:start position:0%
eligible for Medical Aid in dying the
 
06:46:35.388 --> 06:46:35.398 align:start position:0%
terminally ill person must be capable of
 
06:46:37.190 --> 06:46:37.200 align:start position:0%
making an informed
 
06:46:40.030 --> 06:46:40.040 align:start position:0%
decision understanding the full impact
 
06:46:40.990 --> 06:46:41.000 align:start position:0%
of their
 
06:46:45.110 --> 06:46:45.120 align:start position:0%
request if either provider has doubts
 
06:46:46.590 --> 06:46:46.600 align:start position:0%
they must
 
06:46:50.150 --> 06:46:50.160 align:start position:0%
refer the person to a registered mental
 
06:46:52.310 --> 06:46:52.320 align:start position:0%
health professional for
 
06:46:55.388 --> 06:46:55.398 align:start position:0%
evaluation lack of mental capability
 
06:46:58.350 --> 06:46:58.360 align:start position:0%
stops the process the health care
 
06:47:01.430 --> 06:47:01.440 align:start position:0%
providers must review all other
 
06:47:03.948 --> 06:47:03.958 align:start position:0%
treatment and end of life life options
 
06:47:07.510 --> 06:47:07.520 align:start position:0%
available to the terminally ill person
 
06:47:07.520 --> 06:47:09.230 align:start position:0%
available to the terminally ill person
provide

06:47:09.230 --> 06:47:09.240 align:start position:0%
provide
 
06:47:12.628 --> 06:47:12.638 align:start position:0%
resources uh to access those options and
 
06:47:15.030 --> 06:47:15.040 align:start position:0%
confirm that the terminally ill person
 
06:47:18.110 --> 06:47:18.120 align:start position:0%
is aware they can stop the process at
 
06:47:18.120 --> 06:47:19.110 align:start position:0%
is aware they can stop the process at
any

06:47:19.110 --> 06:47:19.120 align:start position:0%
any
 
06:47:22.788 --> 06:47:22.798 align:start position:0%
time only the terminally ill person can
 
06:47:24.110 --> 06:47:24.120 align:start position:0%
request the
 
06:47:27.388 --> 06:47:27.398 align:start position:0%
medication no one else is authorized to
 
06:47:30.388 --> 06:47:30.398 align:start position:0%
make this request on behalf of the
 
06:47:33.548 --> 06:47:33.558 align:start position:0%
terminally ill individual
 
06:47:36.548 --> 06:47:36.558 align:start position:0%
the terminally ill person must be able
 
06:47:39.270 --> 06:47:39.280 align:start position:0%
to self administer the
 
06:47:41.628 --> 06:47:41.638 align:start position:0%
medication must be able to take the
 
06:47:44.110 --> 06:47:44.120 align:start position:0%
medication on their own by mouth or
 
06:47:46.270 --> 06:47:46.280 align:start position:0%
other means that are completely
 
06:47:48.788 --> 06:47:48.798 align:start position:0%
controlled and done by

them a prescription cannot be written
 
06:47:55.868 --> 06:47:55.878 align:start position:0%
until a dying person completes a written
 
06:47:58.030 --> 06:47:58.040 align:start position:0%
request and has two
 
06:48:00.190 --> 06:48:00.200 align:start position:0%
evaluations and two healthc care
 
06:48:02.430 --> 06:48:02.440 align:start position:0%
providers have confirmed that they are
 
06:48:06.708 --> 06:48:06.718 align:start position:0%
El eligible that's basically how it
 
06:48:12.270 --> 06:48:12.280 align:start position:0%
works the bill goes on to talk in uh in
 
06:48:14.948 --> 06:48:14.958 align:start position:0%
detail about how that works to talked
 
06:48:16.230 --> 06:48:16.240 align:start position:0%
about the
 
06:48:19.708 --> 06:48:19.718 align:start position:0%
penalties um that come to anyone who in
 
06:48:24.868 --> 06:48:24.878 align:start position:0%
any way coerces or in any way provides
 
06:48:24.878 --> 06:48:26.510 align:start position:0%
any way coerces or in any way provides
inappropriate

06:48:26.510 --> 06:48:26.520 align:start position:0%
inappropriate
 
06:48:30.270 --> 06:48:30.280 align:start position:0%
pressure I had planned today to focus on
 
06:48:34.388 --> 06:48:34.398 align:start position:0%
what the bill does but it has become
 
06:48:37.628 --> 06:48:37.638 align:start position:0%
obvious to me that there is a need to
 
06:48:43.270 --> 06:48:43.280 align:start position:0%
say what the bill doesn't do and that is
 
06:48:46.388 --> 06:48:46.398 align:start position:0%
necessary because of the materials that
 
06:48:50.430 --> 06:48:50.440 align:start position:0%
have been circulated by individuals
 
06:48:53.270 --> 06:48:53.280 align:start position:0%
concerned with the
 
06:48:56.150 --> 06:48:56.160 align:start position:0%
bill you might recognize the name
 
06:48:59.110 --> 06:48:59.120 align:start position:0%
Kenneth Norton he's a licensed
 
06:49:01.708 --> 06:49:01.718 align:start position:0%
independent clinical social worker who
 
06:49:05.708 --> 06:49:05.718 align:start position:0%
has spent for decades working to prevent

06:49:21.910 --> 06:49:21.920 align:start position:0%
um uh and he he worked most effectively
 
06:49:25.868 --> 06:49:25.878 align:start position:0%
here at Hampshire for many years legally
 
06:49:28.788 --> 06:49:28.798 align:start position:0%

medical examiners and coroners list the
 
06:49:44.430 --> 06:49:44.440 align:start position:0%
underlying terminal illness which the
 
06:49:47.708 --> 06:49:47.718 align:start position:0%
person was diagnosed with as the cause

wish to live and feel that they have no
 
06:50:10.468 --> 06:50:10.478 align:start position:0%
other option than death I'm standing
 
06:50:13.468 --> 06:50:13.478 align:start position:0%
here and thinking about a very loved
 
06:50:16.628 --> 06:50:16.638 align:start position:0%
respected former colleague in this
 
06:50:22.590 --> 06:50:22.600 align:start position:0%
body who felt that the time had come um
 
06:50:25.310 --> 06:50:25.320 align:start position:0%
and waited one day until his wife went
 
06:50:28.708 --> 06:50:28.718 align:start position:0%
out shopping and he then went into the
 
06:50:32.830 --> 06:50:32.840 align:start position:0%
woods and shot himself he did that so so
 
06:50:35.510 --> 06:50:35.520 align:start position:0%
that his wife wouldn't have been there
 
06:50:39.590 --> 06:50:39.600 align:start position:0%
to see him do it and would not have the
 
06:50:44.030 --> 06:50:44.040 align:start position:0%
house become a memory of what he
 
06:50:47.548 --> 06:50:47.558 align:start position:0%
did um the person who chooses Medical
 
06:50:51.788 --> 06:50:51.798 align:start position:0%
Aid and dying wants to live doesn't want
 
06:50:53.868 --> 06:50:53.878 align:start position:0%
to die but wants to
 
06:50:56.670 --> 06:50:56.680 align:start position:0%
live and has been diagnosed with a
 
06:50:58.990 --> 06:50:59.000 align:start position:0%
terminal illness that will end their
 
06:51:02.110 --> 06:51:02.120 align:start position:0%
life and may cause intense suffering
 
06:51:06.868 --> 06:51:06.878 align:start position:0%
before they die they are fully informed
 
06:51:09.750 --> 06:51:09.760 align:start position:0%
of other options including pallative
 
06:51:13.548 --> 06:51:13.558 align:start position:0%
Care Hospice and comfort measures this
 
06:51:15.750 --> 06:51:15.760 align:start position:0%
is not a decision they are allowed to
 
06:51:18.590 --> 06:51:18.600 align:start position:0%
take lightly at the spur of the moment
 
06:51:22.430 --> 06:51:22.440 align:start position:0%
it requires thoughtful controls and two
 
06:51:26.230 --> 06:51:26.240 align:start position:0%
medical opinions in support of
 
06:51:29.110 --> 06:51:29.120 align:start position:0%
specific terminal
 
06:51:32.670 --> 06:51:32.680 align:start position:0%
illness there is a high correlation
 
06:51:36.830 --> 06:51:36.840 align:start position:0%
between suicide and mental illness the
 
06:51:40.708 --> 06:51:40.718 align:start position:0%
person who dies by Suicide may or may
 
06:51:44.070 --> 06:51:44.080 align:start position:0%
not be rational or even competent at
 
06:51:47.548 --> 06:51:47.558 align:start position:0%
that moment research shows that many
 
06:51:51.030 --> 06:51:51.040 align:start position:0%
suicide deaths are impulsive although
 
06:51:53.590 --> 06:51:53.600 align:start position:0%
the person may have complicated
 
06:51:56.548 --> 06:51:56.558 align:start position:0%
contemplated suicide for some time it
 
06:51:58.910 --> 06:51:58.920 align:start position:0%
may be only a matter of
 
06:52:01.590 --> 06:52:01.600 align:start position:0%
minutes between making the decision to
 
06:52:01.600 --> 06:52:03.110 align:start position:0%
minutes between making the decision to
die

06:52:03.110 --> 06:52:03.120 align:start position:0%
die
 
06:52:06.750 --> 06:52:06.760 align:start position:0%

the family and to the community it is is

said that persons who die by Suicide die
 
06:53:39.430 --> 06:53:39.440 align:start position:0%
a single death but their family and
 
06:53:43.150 --> 06:53:43.160 align:start position:0%
friends are left to die a thousand
 
06:53:47.310 --> 06:53:47.320 align:start position:0%
deaths why am I talking about suicide
 
06:53:49.830 --> 06:53:49.840 align:start position:0%
I'm talking about suicide because there
 
06:53:53.150 --> 06:53:53.160 align:start position:0%
are those who are equating Medical Aid
 
06:53:55.590 --> 06:53:55.600 align:start position:0%
in dying with
 
06:53:58.190 --> 06:53:58.200 align:start position:0%
suicide a person who goes through the

Medical Aid and dying process frequently
 
06:54:04.708 --> 06:54:04.718 align:start position:0%
includes love ones in their decision
 
06:54:08.190 --> 06:54:08.200 align:start position:0%
most die in their home surrounded by
 
06:54:11.150 --> 06:54:11.160 align:start position:0%
their family and friends the death is
 
06:54:14.670 --> 06:54:14.680 align:start position:0%
planned peaceful family and friends are
 
06:54:17.150 --> 06:54:17.160 align:start position:0%
at peace knowing that this was their
 
06:54:21.510 --> 06:54:21.520 align:start position:0%
choice and their suffering is over this
 
06:54:24.350 --> 06:54:24.360 align:start position:0%
does not stop those closed persons from
 
06:54:28.468 --> 06:54:28.478 align:start position:0%
grieving but eliminates the wise and wha
 
06:54:31.310 --> 06:54:31.320 align:start position:0%
ifs as well as the
 
06:54:34.388 --> 06:54:34.398 align:start position:0%
trauma there is a difference between
 
06:54:37.628 --> 06:54:37.638 align:start position:0%
suicide and Medical Aid in dying and it
 
06:54:41.948 --> 06:54:41.958 align:start position:0%
is important for us to understand
 
06:54:41.958 --> 06:54:43.468 align:start position:0%
is important for us to understand
that

06:54:43.468 --> 06:54:43.478 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:54:47.628 --> 06:54:47.638 align:start position:0%
another aspect that I want to address
 
06:54:50.230 --> 06:54:50.240 align:start position:0%
that I had to thought I would have to
 
06:54:53.910 --> 06:54:53.920 align:start position:0%
has to do with uh the fact that members
 
06:54:57.270 --> 06:54:57.280 align:start position:0%
of some religious groups have been have
 
06:55:01.310 --> 06:55:01.320 align:start position:0%
been encouraged to oppose the
 
06:55:05.830 --> 06:55:05.840 align:start position:0%
bill hearing people say that and I'm old
 
06:55:08.788 --> 06:55:08.798 align:start position:0%
enough to remember an experience that
 
06:55:12.110 --> 06:55:12.120 align:start position:0%
I'm going to share with you I went to my
 
06:55:15.990 --> 06:55:16.000 align:start position:0%
library shelves to pull out the text of
 
06:55:19.510 --> 06:55:19.520 align:start position:0%
the speech that John Kennedy delivered
 
06:55:24.628 --> 06:55:24.638 align:start position:0%
to a group of baptist ministers in Texas
 
06:55:27.190 --> 06:55:27.200 align:start position:0%
in September of
 
06:55:33.110 --> 06:55:33.120 align:start position:0%
1960 he said I believe in an America
 
06:55:36.030 --> 06:55:36.040 align:start position:0%
that is officially neither Catholic
 
06:55:39.628 --> 06:55:39.638 align:start position:0%
Protestant nor Jewish where no public
 
06:55:43.708 --> 06:55:43.718 align:start position:0%
official either requests or accepts
 
06:55:47.070 --> 06:55:47.080 align:start position:0%
instruction on public policy from the
 
06:55:50.670 --> 06:55:50.680 align:start position:0%
Pope the National Council of churches or
 
06:55:54.708 --> 06:55:54.718 align:start position:0%
any other ecclesiastical Source where no
 
06:55:58.430 --> 06:55:58.440 align:start position:0%
religious body seeks to impose its will
 
06:56:01.788 --> 06:56:01.798 align:start position:0%
directly or indirectly upon the general
 
06:56:01.798 --> 06:56:02.750 align:start position:0%
directly or indirectly upon the general
population

06:56:02.750 --> 06:56:02.760 align:start position:0%
population
 
06:56:05.990 --> 06:56:06.000 align:start position:0%
populace or the public acts of its
 
06:56:09.350 --> 06:56:09.360 align:start position:0%
officials and where religious liberty is
 
06:56:13.868 --> 06:56:13.878 align:start position:0%
so indivisible that an act against one
 
06:56:17.628 --> 06:56:17.638 align:start position:0%
church is treated as an act against
 
06:56:20.388 --> 06:56:20.398 align:start position:0%
all he went on to say I would not look
 
06:56:22.868 --> 06:56:22.878 align:start position:0%
with favor upon a president working to
 
06:56:25.750 --> 06:56:25.760 align:start position:0%
sub the first amendment's guarantee of
 
06:56:28.548 --> 06:56:28.558 align:start position:0%
religious liberty and neither do I look
 
06:56:31.230 --> 06:56:31.240 align:start position:0%
with favor upon those who would work to
 
06:56:33.548 --> 06:56:33.558 align:start position:0%
subvert AR article six of the
 
06:56:36.750 --> 06:56:36.760 align:start position:0%
Constitution by requiring a religious
 
06:56:40.830 --> 06:56:40.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:56:45.430 --> 06:56:45.440 align:start position:0%
indirection Kennedy then said I am not
 
06:56:45.440 --> 06:56:46.590 align:start position:0%
indirection Kennedy then said I am not
the

06:56:46.590 --> 06:56:46.600 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:56:50.708 --> 06:56:50.718 align:start position:0%
Catholic candidate for president I am a
 
06:56:53.190 --> 06:56:53.200 align:start position:0%
candidate for president who happens also
 
06:56:56.430 --> 06:56:56.440 align:start position:0%
to be a Catholic I do not speak for my
 
06:57:00.190 --> 06:57:00.200 align:start position:0%
church on public matters and the church
 
06:57:04.628 --> 06:57:04.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:57:08.548 --> 06:57:08.558 align:start position:0%
I share that with you because we are
 
06:57:12.948 --> 06:57:12.958 align:start position:0%
experiencing all of us um very active
 
06:57:15.910 --> 06:57:15.920 align:start position:0%
Communications from certain religious
 
06:57:18.670 --> 06:57:18.680 align:start position:0%
entities trying to say that their
 
06:57:21.548 --> 06:57:21.558 align:start position:0%
religious beliefs which they hold sacred
 
06:57:26.788 --> 06:57:26.798 align:start position:0%
and I respect should apply to all of
 
06:57:30.430 --> 06:57:30.440 align:start position:0%
us then we have heard I want to move on
 
06:57:33.510 --> 06:57:33.520 align:start position:0%
to another area we have heard from many
 
06:57:36.030 --> 06:57:36.040 align:start position:0%
of our constituents with disabilities
 
06:57:40.628 --> 06:57:40.638 align:start position:0%
who object to this bill and why do they
 
06:57:40.638 --> 06:57:44.388 align:start position:0%
who object to this bill and why do they
object

06:57:44.388 --> 06:57:44.398 align:start position:0%
 
06:57:46.430 --> 06:57:46.440 align:start position:0%
they I'm just waiting for it to get a
 
06:57:51.628 --> 06:57:51.638 align:start position:0%
little quieter they object to not being
 
06:57:54.070 --> 06:57:54.080 align:start position:0%
eligible to
 
06:57:57.190 --> 06:57:57.200 align:start position:0%
participate in the many years since
 
06:58:00.628 --> 06:58:00.638 align:start position:0%
1998 the passage of the organ death With
 
06:58:02.708 --> 06:58:02.718 align:start position:0%
Dignity act um
 
06:58:06.708 --> 06:58:06.718 align:start position:0%
um uh has has been in place the dis the
 
06:58:09.548 --> 06:58:09.558 align:start position:0%
disability rights Center of Oregon has
 
06:58:12.230 --> 06:58:12.240 align:start position:0%
received very few complaints from
 
06:58:15.230 --> 06:58:15.240 align:start position:0%
argonians about the act all of the
 
06:58:18.150 --> 06:58:18.160 align:start position:0%
complaints they have received have focus
 
06:58:20.990 --> 06:58:21.000 align:start position:0%
on the concern that the ACT might
 
06:58:23.708 --> 06:58:23.718 align:start position:0%
discriminate against persons with
 
06:58:27.510 --> 06:58:27.520 align:start position:0%
disabilities who would seek to make use
 
06:58:30.510 --> 06:58:30.520 align:start position:0%
of the ACT but have disabilities that
 
06:58:34.230 --> 06:58:34.240 align:start position:0%
prevent them from self- Administration
 
06:58:36.948 --> 06:58:36.958 align:start position:0%
thereby denying them the ability to use
 
06:58:40.110 --> 06:58:40.120 align:start position:0%
the act the longtime director of the
 
06:58:43.388 --> 06:58:43.398 align:start position:0%
disabilities rights ARG and said that
 
06:58:45.868 --> 06:58:45.878 align:start position:0%
that never to my knowledge have I
 
06:58:47.830 --> 06:58:47.840 align:start position:0%
received a complaint that a person with
 
06:58:52.310 --> 06:58:52.320 align:start position:0%
disability was coerced or being coerced
 
06:58:52.320 --> 06:58:53.430 align:start position:0%
disability was coerced or being coerced
to

06:58:53.430 --> 06:58:53.440 align:start position:0%
to
 
06:58:55.868 --> 06:58:55.878 align:start position:0%
participate there is no question that
 
06:58:57.670 --> 06:58:57.680 align:start position:0%
the disability community and other
 
06:59:02.110 --> 06:59:02.120 align:start position:0%
groups do not have um equal access to
 
06:59:05.030 --> 06:59:05.040 align:start position:0%
Health Care education travel
 
06:59:07.868 --> 06:59:07.878 align:start position:0%
accommodations um I have worked very
 
06:59:10.910 --> 06:59:10.920 align:start position:0%
hard and will continue to work for equal
 
06:59:13.990 --> 06:59:14.000 align:start position:0%
access and I know many of you share that
 
06:59:17.628 --> 06:59:17.638 align:start position:0%
commitment none of this is relevant to
 
06:59:21.150 --> 06:59:21.160 align:start position:0%
this bill this is a
 
06:59:25.270 --> 06:59:25.280 align:start position:0%
bill that very few people would take
 
06:59:27.110 --> 06:59:27.120 align:start position:0%
advantage of remember we'll suspend for
 
06:59:30.510 --> 06:59:30.520 align:start position:0%
a minute it's getting super noisy in
 
06:59:34.230 --> 06:59:34.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:59:40.468 --> 06:59:40.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:59:44.468 --> 06:59:44.478 align:start position:0%
um I think I've I've I've stressed
 
06:59:47.030 --> 06:59:47.040 align:start position:0%
enough points but the one point that I
 
06:59:49.670 --> 06:59:49.680 align:start position:0%
want to remind you of is this is an
 
06:59:52.990 --> 06:59:53.000 align:start position:0%
option it is a choice it is
 
06:59:56.430 --> 06:59:56.440 align:start position:0%
possible um for that very few people
 
06:59:58.830 --> 06:59:58.840 align:start position:0%
will take advantage of it but for those
 
07:00:03.190 --> 07:00:03.200 align:start position:0%
who do it is a comfort and one last
 
07:00:05.830 --> 07:00:05.840 align:start position:0%
point I want to make is that for
 
07:00:09.310 --> 07:00:09.320 align:start position:0%
many of the people who do choose to
 
07:00:11.990 --> 07:00:12.000 align:start position:0%
participate just having the
 
07:00:15.350 --> 07:00:15.360 align:start position:0%
prescription is enough they have comfort
 
07:00:18.750 --> 07:00:18.760 align:start position:0%
from knowing if things get to be too bad
 
07:00:21.788 --> 07:00:21.798 align:start position:0%
and they can't bear the pain anymore
 
07:00:24.948 --> 07:00:24.958 align:start position:0%
they have a choice and they can then
 
07:00:29.510 --> 07:00:29.520 align:start position:0%
keep on trying to live the life that
 
07:00:31.670 --> 07:00:31.680 align:start position:0%
they want to live remember these are
 
07:00:34.350 --> 07:00:34.360 align:start position:0%
people people who want to live they
 
07:00:37.628 --> 07:00:37.638 align:start position:0%
don't want to die what they we could
 
07:00:40.150 --> 07:00:40.160 align:start position:0%
give them is an opportunity to make sure
 
07:00:42.708 --> 07:00:42.718 align:start position:0%
that their death is peaceful thank you
 
07:00:45.230 --> 07:00:45.240 align:start position:0%
very much for your patience does a
 
07:00:47.468 --> 07:00:47.478 align:start position:0%
member yield for a question
 
07:00:54.190 --> 07:00:54.200 align:start position:0%
 
07:00:57.150 --> 07:00:57.160 align:start position:0%
inquire thank you for taking my question
 
07:01:00.070 --> 07:01:00.080 align:start position:0%
I value your knowledge and the thought
 
07:01:02.670 --> 07:01:02.680 align:start position:0%
you've put into this highly
 
07:01:04.590 --> 07:01:04.600 align:start position:0%
I've talked to a lot of people about
 
07:01:06.868 --> 07:01:06.878 align:start position:0%
this bill some of whom are in the
 
07:01:09.310 --> 07:01:09.320 align:start position:0%
medical profession and they have
 
07:01:13.468 --> 07:01:13.478 align:start position:0%
expressed concerns that form the essence
 
07:01:17.190 --> 07:01:17.200 align:start position:0%
of my question is it possible that this
 
07:01:20.548 --> 07:01:20.558 align:start position:0%
end of life option could encourage
 
07:01:23.868 --> 07:01:23.878 align:start position:0%
insurance companies to withdraw support
 
07:01:26.030 --> 07:01:26.040 align:start position:0%
for people who are facing a terminal
 
07:01:28.190 --> 07:01:28.200 align:start position:0%
diagnosis whether they choose this
 
07:01:31.548 --> 07:01:31.558 align:start position:0%
option or not that's a thank you very
 
07:01:35.070 --> 07:01:35.080 align:start position:0%
much for the question all I can say is
 
07:01:37.750 --> 07:01:37.760 align:start position:0%
that is a question that helps to
 
07:01:42.628 --> 07:01:42.638 align:start position:0%
reinforce why we have waited 26 years
 
07:01:46.190 --> 07:01:46.200 align:start position:0%
before we moved forward on this bill and
 
07:01:49.670 --> 07:01:49.680 align:start position:0%
that is that there have been no
 
07:01:53.230 --> 07:01:53.240 align:start position:0%
indications of insurance rates going up
 
07:01:55.670 --> 07:01:55.680 align:start position:0%
or of there being any pressure from the
 
07:01:58.990 --> 07:01:59.000 align:start position:0%
insurance industry or anything at all
 
07:02:02.430 --> 07:02:02.440 align:start position:0%
that changes the status quo once Medical
 
07:02:05.110 --> 07:02:05.120 align:start position:0%
Aid and dying has been adopted in a
 
07:02:08.070 --> 07:02:08.080 align:start position:0%
state thank you thank you very much for
 
07:02:09.750 --> 07:02:09.760 align:start position:0%
the question does a member yield for
 
07:02:11.468 --> 07:02:11.478 align:start position:0%
another question certainly
 
07:02:14.190 --> 07:02:14.200 align:start position:0%
representative Hull you may
 
07:02:17.350 --> 07:02:17.360 align:start position:0%
inquire thank you Mr Speaker real
 
07:02:20.030 --> 07:02:20.040 align:start position:0%
quickly a little over 50 years ago we
 
07:02:22.948 --> 07:02:22.958 align:start position:0%
put on our statutes a Prohibition
 
07:02:24.788 --> 07:02:24.798 align:start position:0%
against assisting in
 
07:02:29.670 --> 07:02:29.680 align:start position:0%
 
07:02:33.868 --> 07:02:33.878 align:start position:0%
6304 I don't find in in this um
 
07:02:36.270 --> 07:02:36.280 align:start position:0%
Amendment or in the bill a repeal of
 
07:02:38.868 --> 07:02:38.878 align:start position:0%
that is there a repeal of that section
 
07:02:38.878 --> 07:02:39.910 align:start position:0%
that is there a repeal of that section
of

07:02:39.910 --> 07:02:39.920 align:start position:0%
of
 
07:02:44.750 --> 07:02:44.760 align:start position:0%
law not in this legislation um I think I
 
07:02:47.110 --> 07:02:47.120 align:start position:0%
have just tried to
 
07:02:50.670 --> 07:02:50.680 align:start position:0%
explain um perhaps too long so that you
 
07:02:53.948 --> 07:02:53.958 align:start position:0%
might have lost the point that this is
 
07:02:57.910 --> 07:02:57.920 align:start position:0%
not suicide it is something that is very
 
07:03:00.548 --> 07:03:00.558 align:start position:0%
different we are not dealing with people
 
07:03:02.548 --> 07:03:02.558 align:start position:0%
who want to die we're dealing with
 
07:03:04.510 --> 07:03:04.520 align:start position:0%
people who want to
 
07:03:08.510 --> 07:03:08.520 align:start position:0%
live follow up sorry there's a
 
07:03:11.750 --> 07:03:11.760 align:start position:0%
line no does a member yield for another
 
07:03:14.628 --> 07:03:14.638 align:start position:0%
question certainly representative
 
07:03:17.910 --> 07:03:17.920 align:start position:0%
 
07:03:17.920 --> 07:03:23.990 align:start position:0%
 
inquire

07:03:23.990 --> 07:03:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
07:03:26.670 --> 07:03:26.680 align:start position:0%
Maguire thank you Mr Speaker and thank
 
07:03:29.230 --> 07:03:29.240 align:start position:0%
you my friend from Durham for taking my
 
07:03:31.910 --> 07:03:31.920 align:start position:0%
question for me the most problematic
 
07:03:34.830 --> 07:03:34.840 align:start position:0%
atic part of this bill is the 48 hour
 
07:03:38.350 --> 07:03:38.360 align:start position:0%
waiting period as I understand it in
 
07:03:40.628 --> 07:03:40.638 align:start position:0%
places that have had this for decades
 
07:03:42.468 --> 07:03:42.478 align:start position:0%
California and Oregon they have a two-
 
07:03:45.590 --> 07:03:45.600 align:start position:0%
week waiting period and it seems to me
 
07:03:48.270 --> 07:03:48.280 align:start position:0%
it might be possible that somebody would
 
07:03:50.708 --> 07:03:50.718 align:start position:0%
have an immediate medical
 
07:03:54.070 --> 07:03:54.080 align:start position:0%
crisis and it would take a week or some
 
07:03:56.788 --> 07:03:56.798 align:start position:0%
number of days to get their medication
 
07:03:59.150 --> 07:03:59.160 align:start position:0%
rebalanced and and get them back in
 
07:04:02.150 --> 07:04:02.160 align:start position:0%
feeling reasonable and and in that that
 
07:04:04.868 --> 07:04:04.878 align:start position:0%
period of Crisis they might want to do
 
07:04:11.230 --> 07:04:11.240 align:start position:0%
 
07:04:14.590 --> 07:04:14.600 align:start position:0%
chosen thank you my uh colleague from
 
07:04:17.468 --> 07:04:17.478 align:start position:0%
Epsom right yes okay those are E Town
 
07:04:19.388 --> 07:04:19.398 align:start position:0%
sometimes I get confused between Epsom
 
07:04:25.150 --> 07:04:25.160 align:start position:0%
and eping but um the answer to that was
 
07:04:30.030 --> 07:04:30.040 align:start position:0%
we wanted to have a reasonable period of
 
07:04:33.510 --> 07:04:33.520 align:start position:0%
time not just start the process but to
 
07:04:35.430 --> 07:04:35.440 align:start position:0%
end the
 
07:04:40.510 --> 07:04:40.520 align:start position:0%
process where it was possible that
 
07:04:46.350 --> 07:04:46.360 align:start position:0%
someone in Dire Straits could in fact um
 
07:04:49.910 --> 07:04:49.920 align:start position:0%
get the medication before their life
 
07:04:52.708 --> 07:04:52.718 align:start position:0%
ended without the comfort of being able
 
07:04:55.468 --> 07:04:55.478 align:start position:0%
to do it this way remember that no one
 
07:04:58.350 --> 07:04:58.360 align:start position:0%
is in this
 
07:05:01.708 --> 07:05:01.718 align:start position:0%
uh is in this program it's horrible word
 
07:05:05.070 --> 07:05:05.080 align:start position:0%
to use no one is involved in this who is
 
07:05:08.070 --> 07:05:08.080 align:start position:0%
perhaps just feeling poorly on any given
 
07:05:12.230 --> 07:05:12.240 align:start position:0%
day these are people who are very near
 
07:05:16.070 --> 07:05:16.080 align:start position:0%
the end of their life and it it seemed a
 
07:05:19.590 --> 07:05:19.600 align:start position:0%
reasonable period of time thank you
 
07:05:22.030 --> 07:05:22.040 align:start position:0%
thank you very much does the member
 
07:05:23.430 --> 07:05:23.440 align:start position:0%
yield for another one I'm just I'm
 
07:05:25.948 --> 07:05:25.958 align:start position:0%
looking at the speaker and I think he's
 
07:05:28.070 --> 07:05:28.080 align:start position:0%
asking me to
 
07:05:32.150 --> 07:05:32.160 align:start position:0%
stop but thank you very much
 
07:05:34.830 --> 07:05:34.840 align:start position:0%
and since we share a last name I owe it
 
07:05:42.868 --> 07:05:42.878 align:start position:0%
 
07:05:45.468 --> 07:05:45.478 align:start position:0%
you representative Hull is recognized
 
07:05:48.190 --> 07:05:48.200 align:start position:0%
speak against the committee
 
07:05:51.070 --> 07:05:51.080 align:start position:0%
report thank you Mr Speaker I'll make
 
07:05:51.080 --> 07:05:53.468 align:start position:0%
report thank you Mr Speaker I'll make
this

07:05:53.468 --> 07:05:53.478 align:start position:0%
 
07:05:58.948 --> 07:05:58.958 align:start position:0%
 
07:06:02.270 --> 07:06:02.280 align:start position:0%
6304 assisting in suicide
 
07:06:04.510 --> 07:06:04.520 align:start position:0%
while the prior speaker mentioned that
 
07:06:07.350 --> 07:06:07.360 align:start position:0%
wasn't this isn't a suicide bill I would
 
07:06:09.190 --> 07:06:09.200 align:start position:0%
like to read for you the statute
 
07:06:11.910 --> 07:06:11.920 align:start position:0%
relative to
 
07:06:14.910 --> 07:06:14.920 align:start position:0%
6304 because I think it does matter that
 
07:06:17.910 --> 07:06:17.920 align:start position:0%
we talk about assisting somebody else in

07:06:24.548 --> 07:06:24.558 align:start position:0%
life let me just bring it back up I had
 
07:06:24.558 --> 07:06:26.788 align:start position:0%
life let me just bring it back up I had
it

07:06:26.788 --> 07:06:26.798 align:start position:0%
 
07:06:26.798 --> 07:06:29.110 align:start position:0%
 
up

07:06:29.110 --> 07:06:29.120 align:start position:0%
up
 
07:06:33.310 --> 07:06:33.320 align:start position:0%
uh 6304 causing or aiding
 
07:06:35.868 --> 07:06:35.878 align:start position:0%
suicide a person is guilty of causing or
 
07:06:39.070 --> 07:06:39.080 align:start position:0%
aiding suicide if he purposely AIDS or
 
07:06:41.548 --> 07:06:41.558 align:start position:0%
solicits another to commit
 
07:06:44.110 --> 07:06:44.120 align:start position:0%
suicide causing or aiding suicide is a
 
07:06:47.628 --> 07:06:47.638 align:start position:0%
class B felony if the actor's conduct
 
07:06:51.670 --> 07:06:51.680 align:start position:0%
causes such suicide or attempted suicide
 
07:06:53.388 --> 07:06:53.398 align:start position:0%
there is in the bill a notwithstanding
 
07:06:55.948 --> 07:06:55.958 align:start position:0%
any other law to the contrary but I
 
07:06:57.708 --> 07:06:57.718 align:start position:0%
challenge the authors of this bill and
 
07:06:59.670 --> 07:06:59.680 align:start position:0%
Amendment why they didn't specifically
 
07:07:01.548 --> 07:07:01.558 align:start position:0%
call out this one which is in direct
 
07:07:04.070 --> 07:07:04.080 align:start position:0%
conflict to the bill as is because
 
07:07:06.070 --> 07:07:06.080 align:start position:0%
people need to be aware that there is a
 
07:07:08.750 --> 07:07:08.760 align:start position:0%
class B felony on our books that would
 
07:07:10.670 --> 07:07:10.680 align:start position:0%
prevent this type of
 
07:07:12.910 --> 07:07:12.920 align:start position:0%
behavior something that clear should be
 
07:07:15.110 --> 07:07:15.120 align:start position:0%
in the bill I would ask that you would
 
07:07:17.190 --> 07:07:17.200 align:start position:0%
oppose the ought to pass
 
07:07:21.430 --> 07:07:21.440 align:start position:0%
motion and support tabling or itl
 
07:07:23.230 --> 07:07:23.240 align:start position:0%
because this is not yet ready the
 
07:07:25.670 --> 07:07:25.680 align:start position:0%
amendment needs more work thank you does
 
07:07:27.350 --> 07:07:27.360 align:start position:0%
a member yield for a
 
07:07:30.430 --> 07:07:30.440 align:start position:0%
question sure
 
07:07:33.190 --> 07:07:33.200 align:start position:0%
one representative cordelli you may
 
07:07:35.708 --> 07:07:35.718 align:start position:0%
inquire uh thank you Mr speaker thank
 
07:07:38.230 --> 07:07:38.240 align:start position:0%
you representative um I believe it was
 
07:07:40.788 --> 07:07:40.798 align:start position:0%
last term we passed legislation that
 
07:07:43.110 --> 07:07:43.120 align:start position:0%
required student ID cards to have a
 
07:07:45.510 --> 07:07:45.520 align:start position:0%
suicide hotline number on the back of
 
07:07:47.830 --> 07:07:47.840 align:start position:0%
their ID cards and you brought up one
 
07:07:50.990 --> 07:07:51.000 align:start position:0%
RSA about suicide on the books and I
 
07:07:52.628 --> 07:07:52.638 align:start position:0%
believe there are many more about
 
07:07:55.990 --> 07:07:56.000 align:start position:0%
suicide prevention um I'm just wondering
 
07:07:59.708 --> 07:07:59.718 align:start position:0%
um has the Supreme Court ruled on cases
 
07:08:02.590 --> 07:08:02.600 align:start position:0%
brought in states where there has been a
 
07:08:08.070 --> 07:08:08.080 align:start position:0%
 
07:08:10.030 --> 07:08:10.040 align:start position:0%
suicide thank you that's a great
 
07:08:12.670 --> 07:08:12.680 align:start position:0%
question why I'm not an expert on every
 
07:08:14.230 --> 07:08:14.240 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court decision I do believe
 
07:08:16.510 --> 07:08:16.520 align:start position:0%
there is a Supreme Court decision out
 
07:08:19.590 --> 07:08:19.600 align:start position:0%
there that rules that this is not a
 
07:08:24.110 --> 07:08:24.120 align:start position:0%
constitutional right for Citizens um and
 
07:08:28.310 --> 07:08:28.320 align:start position:0%
that the we do have individual rights
 
07:08:30.910 --> 07:08:30.920 align:start position:0%
but the right to take one's life is not
 
07:08:30.920 --> 07:08:32.430 align:start position:0%
but the right to take one's life is not
necessary

07:08:32.430 --> 07:08:32.440 align:start position:0%
necessary
 
07:08:33.750 --> 07:08:33.760 align:start position:0%
um something that the Supreme Court has
 
07:08:36.510 --> 07:08:36.520 align:start position:0%
ruled positively on thank
 
07:08:39.230 --> 07:08:39.240 align:start position:0%
you representative Roy recognized speak
 
07:08:49.868 --> 07:08:49.878 align:start position:0%
 
07:08:51.948 --> 07:08:51.958 align:start position:0%
report thank you Mr
 
07:08:55.548 --> 07:08:55.558 align:start position:0%
Speaker Mr Speaker I didn't um I didn't
 
07:08:57.510 --> 07:08:57.520 align:start position:0%
plan on speaking on this at all actually
 
07:08:59.548 --> 07:08:59.558 align:start position:0%
I mean I made up how I was going to vote
 
07:09:01.910 --> 07:09:01.920 align:start position:0%
days ago I I was pretty sure
 
07:09:03.510 --> 07:09:03.520 align:start position:0%
but I I researched it anyway because I
 
07:09:05.468 --> 07:09:05.478 align:start position:0%
like to research these things just to
 
07:09:08.750 --> 07:09:08.760 align:start position:0%
see what's happened and what's going
 
07:09:11.388 --> 07:09:11.398 align:start position:0%
on thank
 
07:09:14.070 --> 07:09:14.080 align:start position:0%
you I I didn't originally plan to speak
 
07:09:16.510 --> 07:09:16.520 align:start position:0%
on this bill um I made up my mind a long
 
07:09:19.708 --> 07:09:19.718 align:start position:0%
time ago um for private and religious
 
07:09:21.350 --> 07:09:21.360 align:start position:0%
reasons how I was going to vote on this
 
07:09:24.628 --> 07:09:24.638 align:start position:0%
bill but I researched it it didn't I
 
07:09:27.190 --> 07:09:27.200 align:start position:0%
thought affect me personally but in my
 
07:09:29.670 --> 07:09:29.680 align:start position:0%
research I I was shocked I'm going to
 
07:09:31.110 --> 07:09:31.120 align:start position:0%
just read something real quick what I
 
07:09:32.750 --> 07:09:32.760 align:start position:0%
discovered on a on a website called
 
07:09:35.388 --> 07:09:35.398 align:start position:0%
dying with Dignity it's about Canada's
 
07:09:36.708 --> 07:09:36.718 align:start position:0%
law what they
 
07:09:39.788 --> 07:09:39.798 align:start position:0%
did and this is a woman uh who
 
07:09:41.910 --> 07:09:41.920 align:start position:0%
championed this in Canada and helped get
 
07:09:44.270 --> 07:09:44.280 align:start position:0%
it past her name was Cheryl she said
 
07:09:48.070 --> 07:09:48.080 align:start position:0%
I've been alive very long but far from
 
07:09:51.190 --> 07:09:51.200 align:start position:0%
living since October 2017 due to my
 
07:09:54.350 --> 07:09:54.360 align:start position:0%
spine and autoimmune issues no chance of
 
07:09:57.430 --> 07:09:57.440 align:start position:0%
being fixed or even improved grossly
 
07:09:59.310 --> 07:09:59.320 align:start position:0%
inadequate symptom control and with
 
07:10:00.750 --> 07:10:00.760 align:start position:0%
knowledge and fear that my condition
 
07:10:03.628 --> 07:10:03.638 align:start position:0%
will continue decline I was diagnosed as
 
07:10:05.070 --> 07:10:05.080 align:start position:0%
having adhesive
 
07:10:07.350 --> 07:10:07.360 align:start position:0%
arachnoiditis one of the most painful
 
07:10:09.628 --> 07:10:09.638 align:start position:0%
conditions a human being can have it's
 
07:10:11.750 --> 07:10:11.760 align:start position:0%
up there with metastatic bone cancer and
 
07:10:14.510 --> 07:10:14.520 align:start position:0%
complex regional pain syndrome the pain
 
07:10:16.510 --> 07:10:16.520 align:start position:0%
I managed with through progressively
 
07:10:20.070 --> 07:10:20.080 align:start position:0%
getting worse and we'll continue to do
 
07:10:21.948 --> 07:10:21.958 align:start position:0%
so I was
 
07:10:26.430 --> 07:10:26.440 align:start position:0%
denied medical assistance in dying in
 
07:10:28.868 --> 07:10:28.878 align:start position:0%
2019 so she goes on to talk about how
 
07:10:31.708 --> 07:10:31.718 align:start position:0%
she helped Canada change it so that it
 
07:10:34.030 --> 07:10:34.040 align:start position:0%
wasn't just people that were 6 months
 
07:10:37.030 --> 07:10:37.040 align:start position:0%
away from dying well I'm going to share
 
07:10:40.070 --> 07:10:40.080 align:start position:0%
with you something pretty personal to me
 
07:10:42.310 --> 07:10:42.320 align:start position:0%
I have adhesive
 
07:10:45.150 --> 07:10:45.160 align:start position:0%
arachnoiditis I am an excruciating pain
 
07:10:47.670 --> 07:10:47.680 align:start position:0%
every day and I could not function
 
07:10:49.230 --> 07:10:49.240 align:start position:0%
without a handful of medicine that I
 
07:10:51.468 --> 07:10:51.478 align:start position:0%
take every day to be here sitting in
 
07:10:53.910 --> 07:10:53.920 align:start position:0%
that chair for hours is excruciating
 
07:10:56.350 --> 07:10:56.360 align:start position:0%
tonight I probably won't sleep for hours
 
07:10:58.310 --> 07:10:58.320 align:start position:0%
and it's going to get
 
07:11:02.310 --> 07:11:02.320 align:start position:0%
worse this bill is the c an's nose under
 
07:11:04.628 --> 07:11:04.638 align:start position:0%
the proverbial tent because that's how
 
07:11:06.270 --> 07:11:06.280 align:start position:0%
they started there it was only if you're
 
07:11:08.468 --> 07:11:08.478 align:start position:0%
about to die and then it was well maybe
 
07:11:10.548 --> 07:11:10.558 align:start position:0%
if you're in pain and it hurts so much
 
07:11:13.230 --> 07:11:13.240 align:start position:0%
we're going to help you there too and
 
07:11:15.070 --> 07:11:15.080 align:start position:0%
that's how it starts and that how it how
 
07:11:17.990 --> 07:11:18.000 align:start position:0%
it ends I have no contemplation in my
 
07:11:19.868 --> 07:11:19.878 align:start position:0%
mind of wanting to die when I get up
 
07:11:22.430 --> 07:11:22.440 align:start position:0%
every day even though it hurts like hell
 
07:11:24.230 --> 07:11:24.240 align:start position:0%
and I don't want to do it I don't want
 
07:11:26.590 --> 07:11:26.600 align:start position:0%
to sit here I don't want to sit there I
 
07:11:28.310 --> 07:11:28.320 align:start position:0%
I just want to lay down and take more
 
07:11:30.788 --> 07:11:30.798 align:start position:0%
opioids because it hurts so freaking bad
 
07:11:33.430 --> 07:11:33.440 align:start position:0%
but I come here and I live every day
 
07:11:35.110 --> 07:11:35.120 align:start position:0%
because I know that I have a duty to my
 
07:11:38.230 --> 07:11:38.240 align:start position:0%
family my friends and the state if I go
 
07:11:40.230 --> 07:11:40.240 align:start position:0%
to the doctor and the doctor tells me
 
07:11:42.430 --> 07:11:42.440 align:start position:0%
hey the insurance company is cutting
 
07:11:44.110 --> 07:11:44.120 align:start position:0%
back on your
 
07:11:46.270 --> 07:11:46.280 align:start position:0%
opioids and they're cutting back on your
 
07:11:48.310 --> 07:11:48.320 align:start position:0%
other pain medications and you gab a pen
 
07:11:52.070 --> 07:11:52.080 align:start position:0%
and this and that but we will cover
 
07:11:54.548 --> 07:11:54.558 align:start position:0%
suicide every time they offer that
 
07:11:56.190 --> 07:11:56.200 align:start position:0%
because now I'm in more and more and
 
07:11:58.468 --> 07:11:58.478 align:start position:0%
more pain that I can't stand it how long
 
07:12:00.150 --> 07:12:00.160 align:start position:0%
will it be till they've basically left
 
07:12:01.750 --> 07:12:01.760 align:start position:0%
me no choice
 
07:12:03.788 --> 07:12:03.798 align:start position:0%
so when you think that this is something
 
07:12:05.750 --> 07:12:05.760 align:start position:0%
about a choice a calm person gets to
 
07:12:08.670 --> 07:12:08.680 align:start position:0%
make and that's not the case and where
 
07:12:11.150 --> 07:12:11.160 align:start position:0%
you have a a a government running your
 
07:12:12.628 --> 07:12:12.638 align:start position:0%
Healthcare which people seem to be
 
07:12:15.230 --> 07:12:15.240 align:start position:0%
asking for a lot you have the doctor and
 
07:12:17.590 --> 07:12:17.600 align:start position:0%
the insurance companies one person there
 
07:12:19.548 --> 07:12:19.558 align:start position:0%
there's no difference between the two so
 
07:12:21.270 --> 07:12:21.280 align:start position:0%
in Canada where they have socialized
 
07:12:23.750 --> 07:12:23.760 align:start position:0%
medicine your doctor is your insurance
 
07:12:27.110 --> 07:12:27.120 align:start position:0%
company and you trust that advice I get
 
07:12:29.708 --> 07:12:29.718 align:start position:0%
care from the VA the doctor is my
 
07:12:31.510 --> 07:12:31.520 align:start position:0%
insurance company thankfully I have
 
07:12:34.230 --> 07:12:34.240 align:start position:0%
private insurance as well but I can
 
07:12:36.150 --> 07:12:36.160 align:start position:0%
imagine shortly if this were the law
 
07:12:38.628 --> 07:12:38.638 align:start position:0%
federally how long would it be before
 
07:12:40.990 --> 07:12:41.000 align:start position:0%
they VA said we can't afford this
 
07:12:44.750 --> 07:12:44.760 align:start position:0%
anymore but for $150 you can have this
 
07:12:48.310 --> 07:12:48.320 align:start position:0%
shot are we a culture of life or a
 
07:12:50.590 --> 07:12:50.600 align:start position:0%
culture of death and that's really the
 
07:12:53.430 --> 07:12:53.440 align:start position:0%
last question I choose to keep living as
 
07:12:56.350 --> 07:12:56.360 align:start position:0%
long as I can and I choose that for
 
07:12:59.030 --> 07:12:59.040 align:start position:0%
multiple reasons and despite the
 
07:13:00.670 --> 07:13:00.680 align:start position:0%
conversation or the statements that were
 
07:13:02.910 --> 07:13:02.920 align:start position:0%
made earlyer ear about leaving religion
 
07:13:06.430 --> 07:13:06.440 align:start position:0%
out John F Kennedy made that
 
07:13:08.868 --> 07:13:08.878 align:start position:0%
speech when he was trying to get elected
 
07:13:10.350 --> 07:13:10.360 align:start position:0%
because he was being accused of being
 
07:13:12.670 --> 07:13:12.680 align:start position:0%
controlled by the pope it had nothing to
 
07:13:15.030 --> 07:13:15.040 align:start position:0%
do with assisted suicide and I guarantee
 
07:13:17.150 --> 07:13:17.160 align:start position:0%
you if he were here today he would not
 
07:13:20.150 --> 07:13:20.160 align:start position:0%
be voting for that thank you does a
 
07:13:23.190 --> 07:13:23.200 align:start position:0%
member yield for a question I do
 
07:13:26.628 --> 07:13:26.638 align:start position:0%
 
07:13:29.350 --> 07:13:29.360 align:start position:0%
inquire uh thank you for uh taking my
 
07:13:32.708 --> 07:13:32.718 align:start position:0%
question uh do you remember in
 
07:13:36.590 --> 07:13:36.600 align:start position:0%
1981 uh Colorado governor Richard lamb
 
07:13:39.190 --> 07:13:39.200 align:start position:0%
uh going on the Sunday morning shows and
 
07:13:43.110 --> 07:13:43.120 align:start position:0%
saying that there was a duty to die and
 
07:13:46.070 --> 07:13:46.080 align:start position:0%
that the old had an obligation to just
 
07:13:47.948 --> 07:13:47.958 align:start position:0%
get out of the way do you do you
 
07:13:49.910 --> 07:13:49.920 align:start position:0%
remember that do you remember what a
 
07:13:52.270 --> 07:13:52.280 align:start position:0%
huge impact that was on the debate in
 
07:13:56.830 --> 07:13:56.840 align:start position:0%
 
07:13:59.628 --> 07:13:59.638 align:start position:0%
80s I do and I'm also old enough to
 
07:14:02.750 --> 07:14:02.760 align:start position:0%
remember a guy named Dr Cav Oran um all
 
07:14:04.948 --> 07:14:04.958 align:start position:0%
of you may remember or many of you may
 
07:14:06.270 --> 07:14:06.280 align:start position:0%
remember and if you don't remember him
 
07:14:08.270 --> 07:14:08.280 align:start position:0%
you might want to look him up because he
 
07:14:09.990 --> 07:14:10.000 align:start position:0%
was nicknamed doctor death back in the
 
07:14:13.628 --> 07:14:13.638 align:start position:0%
80s and he was uh a pioneer of this um
 
07:14:15.708 --> 07:14:15.718 align:start position:0%
he invented a suicide machine for people
 
07:14:18.350 --> 07:14:18.360 align:start position:0%
who are sick in Colorado and he he got
 
07:14:20.150 --> 07:14:20.160 align:start position:0%
sentenced I think I think he died in
 
07:14:22.388 --> 07:14:22.398 align:start position:0%
prison to be honest with you um but yes
 
07:14:24.548 --> 07:14:24.558 align:start position:0%
I do
 
07:14:26.708 --> 07:14:26.718 align:start position:0%
remember representative stapleton's
 
07:14:30.030 --> 07:14:30.040 align:start position:0%
 
07:14:30.040 --> 07:14:35.430 align:start position:0%
 
report

07:14:35.430 --> 07:14:35.440 align:start position:0%
 
07:14:37.430 --> 07:14:37.440 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr
 
07:14:41.548 --> 07:14:41.558 align:start position:0%
Speaker Mr Speaker I rise in opposition
 
07:14:43.708 --> 07:14:43.718 align:start position:0%
to hb1
 
07:14:46.468 --> 07:14:46.478 align:start position:0%
1283 medically aided suicide I'm going
 
07:14:48.030 --> 07:14:48.040 align:start position:0%
to call it what it
 
07:14:51.388 --> 07:14:51.398 align:start position:0%
is in judiciary we had a whole bunch of
 
07:14:54.150 --> 07:14:54.160 align:start position:0%
testimony on this bill for several
 
07:14:57.670 --> 07:14:57.680 align:start position:0%
hours much of it in opposition and the
 
07:14:57.680 --> 07:14:59.030 align:start position:0%
hours much of it in opposition and the
online

07:14:59.030 --> 07:14:59.040 align:start position:0%
online
 
07:15:04.070 --> 07:15:04.080 align:start position:0%
submissions were 128 3 opposed to 651
 
07:15:06.670 --> 07:15:06.680 align:start position:0%
for it almost 2 to
 
07:15:09.948 --> 07:15:09.958 align:start position:0%
one but we also got lots of letters
 
07:15:13.310 --> 07:15:13.320 align:start position:0%
emails phone calls individually from
 
07:15:17.110 --> 07:15:17.120 align:start position:0%
constituents and concern people
 
07:15:19.190 --> 07:15:19.200 align:start position:0%
Statewide opposition to the bill
 
07:15:21.468 --> 07:15:21.478 align:start position:0%
includes many organizations and I'm not
 
07:15:23.070 --> 07:15:23.080 align:start position:0%
going to name them because they have
 
07:15:26.670 --> 07:15:26.680 align:start position:0%
been covered before but I'll add a
 
07:15:29.310 --> 07:15:29.320 align:start position:0%
few the right to New Hampshire right to
 
07:15:32.868 --> 07:15:32.878 align:start position:0%
life an organization known as not dead
 
07:15:35.430 --> 07:15:35.440 align:start position:0%
yet um and some of the veterans
 
07:15:38.830 --> 07:15:38.840 align:start position:0%
organizations that are countering TBI
 
07:15:42.150 --> 07:15:42.160 align:start position:0%
the traumatic brain injury and
 
07:15:47.590 --> 07:15:47.600 align:start position:0%
 
07:15:51.990 --> 07:15:52.000 align:start position:0%
Bishops um probably some other churches
 
07:15:55.030 --> 07:15:55.040 align:start position:0%
and denominations have also weighed in
 
07:15:56.510 --> 07:15:56.520 align:start position:0%
the list is
 
07:15:59.510 --> 07:15:59.520 align:start position:0%
long what all of this points to is the
 
07:16:02.190 --> 07:16:02.200 align:start position:0%
potential influence state State assisted
 
07:16:05.750 --> 07:16:05.760 align:start position:0%
or state sanctioned suicide has upon
 
07:16:08.548 --> 07:16:08.558 align:start position:0%
vulnerable groups when they see
 
07:16:11.910 --> 07:16:11.920 align:start position:0%
validation for the terminally ill and
 
07:16:14.030 --> 07:16:14.040 align:start position:0%
feel that their life condition ought to
 
07:16:16.030 --> 07:16:16.040 align:start position:0%
have that option as
 
07:16:19.350 --> 07:16:19.360 align:start position:0%
well life becomes cheapened when suicide
 
07:16:19.360 --> 07:16:20.310 align:start position:0%
well life becomes cheapened when suicide
becomes

07:16:20.310 --> 07:16:20.320 align:start position:0%
becomes
 
07:16:22.868 --> 07:16:22.878 align:start position:0%
normalized and the natural survival
 
07:16:24.548 --> 07:16:24.558 align:start position:0%
Instinct to carry
 
07:16:29.190 --> 07:16:29.200 align:start position:0%
on or get better is diminished as we've
 
07:16:32.990 --> 07:16:33.000 align:start position:0%
heard it crushes hope for or for
 
07:16:34.750 --> 07:16:34.760 align:start position:0%
improvement or
 
07:16:37.910 --> 07:16:37.920 align:start position:0%
recovery vulnerable groups like troubled
 
07:16:40.830 --> 07:16:40.840 align:start position:0%
youth depressed
 
07:16:44.070 --> 07:16:44.080 align:start position:0%
disabled the Aged and the infirm
 
07:16:46.350 --> 07:16:46.360 align:start position:0%
chronically ill and even people
 
07:16:48.948 --> 07:16:48.958 align:start position:0%
struggling with a poor quality of life
 
07:16:51.070 --> 07:16:51.080 align:start position:0%
can now be at
 
07:16:54.030 --> 07:16:54.040 align:start position:0%
risk and all of this puts pressure for
 
07:16:57.830 --> 07:16:57.840 align:start position:0%
us as legislators to gradually expand
 
07:17:00.910 --> 07:17:00.920 align:start position:0%
beyond the six-month terminal to any
 
07:17:02.868 --> 07:17:02.878 align:start position:0%
further maladies that are deemed
 
07:17:06.430 --> 07:17:06.440 align:start position:0%
suitable and that are asked before
 
07:17:10.270 --> 07:17:10.280 align:start position:0%
us such has already happened in Canada
 
07:17:13.468 --> 07:17:13.478 align:start position:0%
when terminal illness was expanded in
 
07:17:18.150 --> 07:17:18.160 align:start position:0%
2016 to death reasonably
 
07:17:20.110 --> 07:17:20.120 align:start position:0%
forseeable and in
 
07:17:23.948 --> 07:17:23.958 align:start position:0%
2023 to serious physical
 
07:17:28.350 --> 07:17:28.360 align:start position:0%
disability and in March this month was
 
07:17:31.948 --> 07:17:31.958 align:start position:0%
to be expanded to mental illness
 
07:17:34.670 --> 07:17:34.680 align:start position:0%
but now being put on hold with
 
07:17:37.150 --> 07:17:37.160 align:start position:0%
legislation trying to get a three-year
 
07:17:40.990 --> 07:17:41.000 align:start position:0%
stay on that their concern has finally
 
07:17:44.310 --> 07:17:44.320 align:start position:0%
Arisen over unanticipated suicide
 
07:17:49.628 --> 07:17:49.638 align:start position:0%

07:17:56.830 --> 07:17:56.840 align:start position:0%
41% highest in the
 
07:18:00.030 --> 07:18:00.040 align:start position:0%

07:18:27.230 --> 07:18:27.240 align:start position:0%

07:18:31.670 --> 07:18:31.680 align:start position:0%
63% after SB 380 passed
 
07:18:34.830 --> 07:18:34.840 align:start position:0%
reducing the wait time from 15 days to
 
07:18:38.948 --> 07:18:38.958 align:start position:0%

criteria the floodgates have have been
 
07:19:03.868 --> 07:19:03.878 align:start position:0%
opened and we're not going to be immune
 
07:19:07.670 --> 07:19:07.680 align:start position:0%
to that Supreme Court Justice Neil
 
07:19:09.990 --> 07:19:10.000 align:start position:0%
Gorsuch chronicled in his book on
 
07:19:11.310 --> 07:19:11.320 align:start position:0%
suicide in
 
07:19:14.350 --> 07:19:14.360 align:start position:0%

07:19:18.070 --> 07:19:18.080 align:start position:0%
expanded reasons surged to
 
07:19:21.548 --> 07:19:21.558 align:start position:0%
7.5% of all deaths in the Netherlands

after being legalized there in the
 
07:19:29.628 --> 07:19:29.638 align:start position:0%
1980s all of it shows a propensity for

1980s all of it shows a propensity for
expansion

07:19:32.110 --> 07:19:32.120 align:start position:0%
expansion
 
07:19:34.670 --> 07:19:34.680 align:start position:0%
in so many of the proponent letters I
 
07:19:38.190 --> 07:19:38.200 align:start position:0%
got albeit with heartfelt stories of
 
07:19:41.868 --> 07:19:41.878 align:start position:0%
family members dying in miserable pain I
 
07:19:45.150 --> 07:19:45.160 align:start position:0%
was struck by the lack of use trust or
 
07:19:50.350 --> 07:19:50.360 align:start position:0%
 
07:19:53.948 --> 07:19:53.958 align:start position:0%
Care having myself been there when
 
07:19:57.270 --> 07:19:57.280 align:start position:0%
relatives and Friends pasted including
 
07:19:59.628 --> 07:19:59.638 align:start position:0%
terminal cancel cancer
 
07:20:02.468 --> 07:20:02.478 align:start position:0%
situations I was confident in the good
 
07:20:05.190 --> 07:20:05.200 align:start position:0%
care provided
 
07:20:08.548 --> 07:20:08.558 align:start position:0%
them the lack of trust in the ever
 
07:20:11.150 --> 07:20:11.160 align:start position:0%
improving hospice and pallative Care
 
07:20:13.310 --> 07:20:13.320 align:start position:0%
field is
 
07:20:15.830 --> 07:20:15.840 align:start position:0%
disturbing there are improvements there
 
07:20:17.948 --> 07:20:17.958 align:start position:0%
yet to be made for
 
07:20:21.110 --> 07:20:21.120 align:start position:0%
sure but for instance in France they
 
07:20:23.830 --> 07:20:23.840 align:start position:0%
have the Clay's leonet
 
07:20:29.430 --> 07:20:29.440 align:start position:0%
law that's c l AE Ys Clay's leonet law
 
07:20:30.910 --> 07:20:30.920 align:start position:0%
you could look it up in Google and
 
07:20:32.628 --> 07:20:32.638 align:start position:0%
you'll get the
 
07:20:35.750 --> 07:20:35.760 align:start position:0%
story where Advanced pallative Care is
 
07:20:37.990 --> 07:20:38.000 align:start position:0%
provided with skillfully administered
 
07:20:41.670 --> 07:20:41.680 align:start position:0%
dosages carefully measured to overcome
 
07:20:44.590 --> 07:20:44.600 align:start position:0%
thresholds of pain but not itself
 
07:20:48.310 --> 07:20:48.320 align:start position:0%
causing the death instead the body
 
07:20:48.320 --> 07:20:50.350 align:start position:0%
causing the death instead the body
transpiring

07:20:50.350 --> 07:20:50.360 align:start position:0%
transpiring
 
07:20:53.430 --> 07:20:53.440 align:start position:0%
naturally this fulfills valid and
 
07:20:56.990 --> 07:20:57.000 align:start position:0%
established ethical and moral concerns
 
07:21:03.230 --> 07:21:03.240 align:start position:0%
 
07:21:05.590 --> 07:21:05.600 align:start position:0%
in my opposition I represent
 
07:21:09.070 --> 07:21:09.080 align:start position:0%
constituents and colleagues who respect
 
07:21:11.830 --> 07:21:11.840 align:start position:0%
the sanctity of life from the moment of
 
07:21:14.510 --> 07:21:14.520 align:start position:0%
conception to Natural
 
07:21:17.430 --> 07:21:17.440 align:start position:0%
death one of the parties represented in
 
07:21:19.750 --> 07:21:19.760 align:start position:0%
this chamber has a platform plank
 
07:21:22.910 --> 07:21:22.920 align:start position:0%
dedicated to that very
 
07:21:25.788 --> 07:21:25.798 align:start position:0%
principle those of us who are Faith
 
07:21:29.350 --> 07:21:29.360 align:start position:0%
Believers trust not only in God but also
 
07:21:32.430 --> 07:21:32.440 align:start position:0%
in the advances of of medicine that will
 
07:21:37.230 --> 07:21:37.240 align:start position:0%
find better ways than what this bill
 
07:21:40.548 --> 07:21:40.558 align:start position:0%
offers and they'll do so with the ethic
 
07:21:42.310 --> 07:21:42.320 align:start position:0%
Do no
 
07:21:46.110 --> 07:21:46.120 align:start position:0%
harm please join me in voting no with
 
07:21:49.110 --> 07:21:49.120 align:start position:0%
the red button so that another and
 
07:21:53.510 --> 07:21:53.520 align:start position:0%
better itl motion can be made Mr Speaker
 
07:21:56.230 --> 07:21:56.240 align:start position:0%
I will take no questions and I asked for
 
07:21:59.830 --> 07:21:59.840 align:start position:0%
a roll call vote thank you Mr speaker
 
07:22:06.230 --> 07:22:06.240 align:start position:0%
 
07:22:08.868 --> 07:22:08.878 align:start position:0%
no representative Lind recognized to
 
07:22:14.510 --> 07:22:14.520 align:start position:0%
 
07:22:18.070 --> 07:22:18.080 align:start position:0%
report thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker I
 
07:22:21.868 --> 07:22:21.878 align:start position:0%
rise in support of HB 1283 the
 
07:22:25.350 --> 07:22:25.360 align:start position:0%
bipartisan end of life options act it's
 
07:22:26.868 --> 07:22:26.878 align:start position:0%
obvious that some members of this
 
07:22:29.110 --> 07:22:29.120 align:start position:0%
chamber have strongly held views against
 
07:22:31.548 --> 07:22:31.558 align:start position:0%
this legislation just as some people in
 
07:22:34.948 --> 07:22:34.958 align:start position:0%
the community do but I submit colleagues
 
07:22:37.030 --> 07:22:37.040 align:start position:0%
that these are not the views of the
 
07:22:39.750 --> 07:22:39.760 align:start position:0%
majority of our fellow citizens and I
 
07:22:41.788 --> 07:22:41.798 align:start position:0%
hope and believe that they are not the
 
07:22:43.670 --> 07:22:43.680 align:start position:0%
views of the majority of the members of
 
07:22:47.030 --> 07:22:47.040 align:start position:0%
this house a survey conducted by the
 
07:22:50.190 --> 07:22:50.200 align:start position:0%
well-respected UNH Survey Center found
 
07:22:53.150 --> 07:22:53.160 align:start position:0%
that more than 70% of granted Staters
 
07:22:56.190 --> 07:22:56.200 align:start position:0%
favor this legislation including
 
07:22:58.830 --> 07:22:58.840 align:start position:0%
majorities of both Republicans and
 
07:23:02.070 --> 07:23:02.080 align:start position:0%
Democrats a majority of gun owners why
 
07:23:03.868 --> 07:23:03.878 align:start position:0%
the survey decided to ask that question
 
07:23:05.548 --> 07:23:05.558 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure but a majority of gun
 
07:23:07.510 --> 07:23:07.520 align:start position:0%
owners which would include
 
07:23:13.788 --> 07:23:13.798 align:start position:0%
me 55 uh I'm sorry 53% of Catholics and
 
07:23:18.270 --> 07:23:18.280 align:start position:0%
importantly 75% of people with
 
07:23:21.510 --> 07:23:21.520 align:start position:0%
disabilities these numbers are not
 
07:23:23.750 --> 07:23:23.760 align:start position:0%
surprising because at the most
 
07:23:27.070 --> 07:23:27.080 align:start position:0%
fundamental level what this bill is
 
07:23:28.910 --> 07:23:28.920 align:start position:0%
about is
 
07:23:32.628 --> 07:23:32.638 align:start position:0%
freedom simply put the question each of
 
07:23:35.190 --> 07:23:35.200 align:start position:0%
you must ask yourself is should a
 
07:23:38.388 --> 07:23:38.398 align:start position:0%
terminally ill person who is in who is
 
07:23:40.788 --> 07:23:40.798 align:start position:0%
within six months of death have the
 
07:23:44.150 --> 07:23:44.160 align:start position:0%
right to make a knowing intelligent and
 
07:23:47.350 --> 07:23:47.360 align:start position:0%
voluntary choice to end his or her
 
07:23:50.548 --> 07:23:50.558 align:start position:0%
suffering and peace peacefully die in
 
07:23:54.670 --> 07:23:54.680 align:start position:0%
their sleep I believe that especially in
 
07:23:57.830 --> 07:23:57.840 align:start position:0%
this state which so strongly and proudly
 
07:24:00.350 --> 07:24:00.360 align:start position:0%
proclaims its commitment to indiv
 
07:24:03.308 --> 07:24:03.318 align:start position:0%
individuality and to Liberty as embodied
 
07:24:06.150 --> 07:24:06.160 align:start position:0%
in our motto of Live Free or Die the
 
07:24:09.548 --> 07:24:09.558 align:start position:0%
answer to that question is a resounding
 
07:24:14.110 --> 07:24:14.120 align:start position:0%
yes I am 74 years old and fortunately I
 
07:24:17.150 --> 07:24:17.160 align:start position:0%
am in reasonably good health but I know
 
07:24:20.030 --> 07:24:20.040 align:start position:0%
that I'm in the Autumn of life's journey
 
07:24:21.990 --> 07:24:22.000 align:start position:0%
and then that in the perhaps not too
 
07:24:25.590 --> 07:24:25.600 align:start position:0%
distant future I like all of you will
 
07:24:28.830 --> 07:24:28.840 align:start position:0%
have no choice but to face death when
 
07:24:32.110 --> 07:24:32.120 align:start position:0%
that 's come that time comes and I am
 
07:24:34.910 --> 07:24:34.920 align:start position:0%
close to the end with no chance of
 
07:24:38.350 --> 07:24:38.360 align:start position:0%
survival when hosp hospice and pallative
 
07:24:41.468 --> 07:24:41.478 align:start position:0%
Care are not enough I think I should
 
07:24:43.868 --> 07:24:43.878 align:start position:0%
have the option of choosing not to
 
07:24:48.150 --> 07:24:48.160 align:start position:0%
needlessly suffer and you and all of our
 
07:24:50.270 --> 07:24:50.280 align:start position:0%
fellow citizens should have the right to
 
07:24:51.830 --> 07:24:51.840 align:start position:0%
make that same
 
07:24:55.590 --> 07:24:55.600 align:start position:0%
Choice those of us who support this
 
07:24:58.070 --> 07:24:58.080 align:start position:0%
legislation understand that many who
 
07:25:00.910 --> 07:25:00.920 align:start position:0%
oppose it do so for sincerely L held
 
07:25:04.230 --> 07:25:04.240 align:start position:0%
religious and moral beliefs we respect
 
07:25:06.830 --> 07:25:06.840 align:start position:0%
your position and would never suggest
 
07:25:08.788 --> 07:25:08.798 align:start position:0%
that you should be required to accept
 
07:25:11.270 --> 07:25:11.280 align:start position:0%
Medical Aid and dying for yourselves or
 
07:25:14.628 --> 07:25:14.638 align:start position:0%
your loved ones we ask only that you
 
07:25:17.990 --> 07:25:18.000 align:start position:0%
Accord us the same respect and not force
 
07:25:20.468 --> 07:25:20.478 align:start position:0%
your beliefs on those who choose not to
 
07:25:23.590 --> 07:25:23.600 align:start position:0%
share them let me take a moment to
 
07:25:25.628 --> 07:25:25.638 align:start position:0%
dispel some of the myths that have been
 
07:25:28.350 --> 07:25:28.360 align:start position:0%
circulating in The Ether about this
 
07:25:31.150 --> 07:25:31.160 align:start position:0%
bill no it does not allow a
 
07:25:34.270 --> 07:25:34.280 align:start position:0%
dermatologist or podiatrist to prescribe
 
07:25:35.628 --> 07:25:35.638 align:start position:0%
the end of life
 
07:25:38.590 --> 07:25:38.600 align:start position:0%
medications both the the prescribing
 
07:25:40.788 --> 07:25:40.798 align:start position:0%
health care pro provider and the
 
07:25:44.308 --> 07:25:44.318 align:start position:0%
Consulting health care provider must be
 
07:25:48.270 --> 07:25:48.280 align:start position:0%
qualified by specialty or experience to
 
07:25:51.308 --> 07:25:51.318 align:start position:0%
make the diagnosis of a terminal
 
07:25:53.708 --> 07:25:53.718 align:start position:0%
condition with six months or less to
 
07:25:57.070 --> 07:25:57.080 align:start position:0%
live no there is no significant evidence
 
07:25:59.670 --> 07:25:59.680 align:start position:0%
of the endof life medications not
 
07:25:59.680 --> 07:26:01.230 align:start position:0%
of the endof life medications not
working

07:26:01.230 --> 07:26:01.240 align:start position:0%
working
 
07:26:03.468 --> 07:26:03.478 align:start position:0%
um or causing increased pain and
 
07:26:06.030 --> 07:26:06.040 align:start position:0%
suffering are there occasional
 
07:26:08.430 --> 07:26:08.440 align:start position:0%
complications yes but these are
 
07:26:11.990 --> 07:26:12.000 align:start position:0%
exceedingly rare no there is no
 
07:26:14.350 --> 07:26:14.360 align:start position:0%
statistically demonstrated correlation
 
07:26:16.788 --> 07:26:16.798 align:start position:0%
between uh Medical Aid and dying
 
07:26:20.628 --> 07:26:20.638 align:start position:0%
legislation and suicide rates no
 
07:26:23.430 --> 07:26:23.440 align:start position:0%
insurance companies cannot deny coverage
 
07:26:26.590 --> 07:26:26.600 align:start position:0%
under Life Health or annuity policies
 
07:26:29.030 --> 07:26:29.040 align:start position:0%
based on the existence of Medical Aid
 
07:26:32.430 --> 07:26:32.440 align:start position:0%
and dying or a person's choice to use it
 
07:26:35.548 --> 07:26:35.558 align:start position:0%
no the bill does not require a witness
 
07:26:37.628 --> 07:26:37.638 align:start position:0%
to actually see the patient take the
 
07:26:40.910 --> 07:26:40.920 align:start position:0%
medic medic medic uh the medications
 
07:26:43.788 --> 07:26:43.798 align:start position:0%
because if we were to do so then to
 
07:26:47.308 --> 07:26:47.318 align:start position:0%
achieve the presumably unbiased witness
 
07:26:49.190 --> 07:26:49.200 align:start position:0%
we would have to require that someone
 
07:26:51.948 --> 07:26:51.958 align:start position:0%
other than a close relative be present
 
07:26:54.468 --> 07:26:54.478 align:start position:0%
and this would insert an outsider into
 
07:26:57.628 --> 07:26:57.638 align:start position:0%
what the patient expects to be a last
 
07:27:00.830 --> 07:27:00.840 align:start position:0%
intimate time with loved ones no the
 
07:27:03.510 --> 07:27:03.520 align:start position:0%
bill the bill does not prevent a comp uh
 
07:27:05.830 --> 07:27:05.840 align:start position:0%
competent but disabled person from
 
07:27:08.948 --> 07:27:08.958 align:start position:0%
Consulting with and seeking advice from
 
07:27:11.548 --> 07:27:11.558 align:start position:0%
a guardian or s or surrogate before
 
07:27:14.190 --> 07:27:14.200 align:start position:0%
choosing Medical Aid and dying the bill
 
07:27:16.750 --> 07:27:16.760 align:start position:0%
merely says that such person cannot be
 
07:27:19.430 --> 07:27:19.440 align:start position:0%
the ones to make the decision that
 
07:27:22.788 --> 07:27:22.798 align:start position:0%
decision can be made only by the patient
 
07:27:25.548 --> 07:27:25.558 align:start position:0%
personally and the bill contains no
 
07:27:28.468 --> 07:27:28.478 align:start position:0%
residency requirement because that would
 
07:27:32.110 --> 07:27:32.120 align:start position:0%
very likely be legally valid and even if
 
07:27:35.270 --> 07:27:35.280 align:start position:0%
it wasn't what proper purpose would be
 
07:27:38.270 --> 07:27:38.280 align:start position:0%
served by disallowing out of sters from
 
07:27:41.150 --> 07:27:41.160 align:start position:0%
taking advantage of the peaceful uh
 
07:27:44.990 --> 07:27:45.000 align:start position:0%
ending afforded by this law I for one am
 
07:27:46.590 --> 07:27:46.600 align:start position:0%
not worried that New Hampshire will
 
07:27:48.990 --> 07:27:49.000 align:start position:0%
become known as a state that allows
 
07:27:50.990 --> 07:27:51.000 align:start position:0%
terminally ill that allows the
 
07:27:54.230 --> 07:27:54.240 align:start position:0%
terminally ill to die with dignity
 
07:27:56.948 --> 07:27:56.958 align:start position:0%
finally let me address the so-called
 
07:28:00.510 --> 07:28:00.520 align:start position:0%
slippery slope argument have you noticed
 
07:28:02.548 --> 07:28:02.558 align:start position:0%
that much of the attacks on this bill
 
07:28:05.750 --> 07:28:05.760 align:start position:0%
are not a are aimed not at what the bill
 
07:28:09.468 --> 07:28:09.478 align:start position:0%
actually says or does but at the fear of
 
07:28:11.948 --> 07:28:11.958 align:start position:0%
how the law might be changed in the
 
07:28:14.590 --> 07:28:14.600 align:start position:0%
future some have expressed concern that
 
07:28:16.270 --> 07:28:16.280 align:start position:0%
this law could be expanded from the
 
07:28:18.350 --> 07:28:18.360 align:start position:0%
strict and narrowly tailored right to
 
07:28:21.230 --> 07:28:21.240 align:start position:0%
die for terminally ill patients to
 
07:28:23.708 --> 07:28:23.718 align:start position:0%
Encompass people with significant but
 
07:28:26.388 --> 07:28:26.398 align:start position:0%
not terminal disabilities or could even
 
07:28:28.990 --> 07:28:29.000 align:start position:0%
morph into imposing a duty to die for
 
07:28:31.190 --> 07:28:31.200 align:start position:0%
such individuals
 
07:28:34.110 --> 07:28:34.120 align:start position:0%
given the past history of the Eugenics
 
07:28:37.510 --> 07:28:37.520 align:start position:0%
movement in this country and abroad I Do
 
07:28:40.350 --> 07:28:40.360 align:start position:0%
Not For a Moment suggest that we should
 
07:28:44.030 --> 07:28:44.040 align:start position:0%
ignore such concerns it has been nearly
 
07:28:47.788 --> 07:28:47.798 align:start position:0%
100 years since the 1927 Supreme Court
 
07:28:50.510 --> 07:28:50.520 align:start position:0%
decision in which Justice Oliver Wendell
 
07:28:53.430 --> 07:28:53.440 align:start position:0%
Holmes upheld Virginia's mandatory
 
07:28:56.230 --> 07:28:56.240 align:start position:0%
sterilization law for the mentally
 
07:29:00.110 --> 07:29:00.120 align:start position:0%
incompetent acerbically declaring that
 
07:29:03.308 --> 07:29:03.318 align:start position:0%
three generations of imbeciles are
 
07:29:08.590 --> 07:29:08.600 align:start position:0%
enough fortunately our so our societal
 
07:29:12.190 --> 07:29:12.200 align:start position:0%
Behavior Uh our societal Behavior over
 
07:29:15.430 --> 07:29:15.440 align:start position:0%
at least the past 50 years demonstrates
 
07:29:17.590 --> 07:29:17.600 align:start position:0%
that we have seen the errors of our
 
07:29:20.708 --> 07:29:20.718 align:start position:0%
attitudes towards the the disabled and
 
07:29:23.350 --> 07:29:23.360 align:start position:0%
will not repeat them beginning in the
 
07:29:25.830 --> 07:29:25.840 align:start position:0%
1970s we enacted the Americans with
 
07:29:28.388 --> 07:29:28.398 align:start position:0%
Disabilities Act the individuals with
 
07:29:30.590 --> 07:29:30.600 align:start position:0%
disabilities Education Act
 
07:29:33.430 --> 07:29:33.440 align:start position:0%
and many other federal and state laws to
 
07:29:35.468 --> 07:29:35.478 align:start position:0%
protect and provide equal treatment to
 
07:29:37.670 --> 07:29:37.680 align:start position:0%
persons with physical or mental
 
07:29:39.948 --> 07:29:39.958 align:start position:0%
impairments have we been completely
 
07:29:41.948 --> 07:29:41.958 align:start position:0%
successful in ensuring the equal
 
07:29:44.948 --> 07:29:44.958 align:start position:0%
equality for the disabled no but I
 
07:29:47.150 --> 07:29:47.160 align:start position:0%
believe it is fair to say that our
 
07:29:50.430 --> 07:29:50.440 align:start position:0%
actions make it very clear that the idea
 
07:29:53.590 --> 07:29:53.600 align:start position:0%
of dis disrespecting or dispatching
 
07:29:56.430 --> 07:29:56.440 align:start position:0%
those with disabilities enjoys no
 
07:30:00.388 --> 07:30:00.398 align:start position:0%
political capital in this day and age at
 
07:30:03.190 --> 07:30:03.200 align:start position:0%
base the slippery slope argument is
 
07:30:06.350 --> 07:30:06.360 align:start position:0%
premised on the notion that we as a
 
07:30:09.468 --> 07:30:09.478 align:start position:0%
legislature or more broadly we as a
 
07:30:12.830 --> 07:30:12.840 align:start position:0%
society cannot trust ourselves to act
 
07:30:15.868 --> 07:30:15.878 align:start position:0%
reasonably and responsibly in the future
 
07:30:17.948 --> 07:30:17.958 align:start position:0%
with respect to Medical Aid and
 
07:30:22.910 --> 07:30:22.920 align:start position:0%
dying I ask you to to join me in saying
 
07:30:26.308 --> 07:30:26.318 align:start position:0%
no to that view of the world this bill
 
07:30:28.830 --> 07:30:28.840 align:start position:0%
is about freedom but like all other
 
07:30:30.708 --> 07:30:30.718 align:start position:0%
rights Freedom does not mean everyone
 
07:30:32.750 --> 07:30:32.760 align:start position:0%
should have an unlimited right to do
 
07:30:37.308 --> 07:30:37.318 align:start position:0%
anything he or she wants to do lines can
 
07:30:39.830 --> 07:30:39.840 align:start position:0%
indeed must be drawn between what can be
 
07:30:43.708 --> 07:30:43.718 align:start position:0%
done and what cannot drawing such lines
 
07:30:46.830 --> 07:30:46.840 align:start position:0%
is precisely the the job of this
 
07:30:51.548 --> 07:30:51.558 align:start position:0%
legislature it is what we do every day I
 
07:30:54.230 --> 07:30:54.240 align:start position:0%
believe for example that all of us can
 
07:30:57.110 --> 07:30:57.120 align:start position:0%
say with confidence that this bill's
 
07:30:59.308 --> 07:30:59.318 align:start position:0%
requirement of terminal illness within 6
 
07:31:01.868 --> 07:31:01.878 align:start position:0%
months or less to live as a prerequisite
 
07:31:04.910 --> 07:31:04.920 align:start position:0%
for Medical Aid in dying constitutes a
 
07:31:08.150 --> 07:31:08.160 align:start position:0%
full stop and that we will never go down
 
07:31:11.270 --> 07:31:11.280 align:start position:0%
the road of saying that someone who is
 
07:31:14.150 --> 07:31:14.160 align:start position:0%
not terminally ill can end his or her
 
07:31:17.308 --> 07:31:17.318 align:start position:0%
life merely because they are disabled or
 
07:31:20.548 --> 07:31:20.558 align:start position:0%
depressed and wish to do so no matter
 
07:31:23.308 --> 07:31:23.318 align:start position:0%
how serious those conditions may be you
 
07:31:25.270 --> 07:31:25.280 align:start position:0%
will never get my vote for something
 
07:31:28.510 --> 07:31:28.520 align:start position:0%
like that for these reasons colleagues I
 
07:31:31.230 --> 07:31:31.240 align:start position:0%
ask you to support the o TP motion by
 
07:31:33.468 --> 07:31:33.478 align:start position:0%

07:34:37.750 --> 07:34:37.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker if I know that hb12
 
07:34:41.150 --> 07:34:41.160 align:start position:0%
83 deals with an extremely difficult and
 
07:34:43.708 --> 07:34:43.718 align:start position:0%
personal issue and that the rights of
 
07:34:46.910 --> 07:34:46.920 align:start position:0%
everyone needs to be respected including
 
07:34:49.350 --> 07:34:49.360 align:start position:0%
not only those who are close to death
 
07:34:52.388 --> 07:34:52.398 align:start position:0%
but also our most vulnerable population
 
07:34:54.750 --> 07:34:54.760 align:start position:0%
equally and if I know that most
 
07:34:57.190 --> 07:34:57.200 align:start position:0%
individuals with disabilities and their
 
07:35:01.548 --> 07:35:01.558 align:start position:0%
families are opposed to H B
 
07:35:04.388 --> 07:35:04.398 align:start position:0%
1283 and most of the new New Hampshire
 
07:35:07.030 --> 07:35:07.040 align:start position:0%
based organizations advocating for the
 
07:35:09.270 --> 07:35:09.280 align:start position:0%
rights of our most vulnerable population
 
07:35:12.070 --> 07:35:12.080 align:start position:0%
are also opposed to HB
 
07:35:14.548 --> 07:35:14.558 align:start position:0%
1283 and if I know that I am not
 
07:35:16.388 --> 07:35:16.398 align:start position:0%
concerned about what the bill might do
 
07:35:19.150 --> 07:35:19.160 align:start position:0%
in the future but what it could very
 
07:35:20.270 --> 07:35:20.280 align:start position:0%
well do
 
07:35:22.910 --> 07:35:22.920 align:start position:0%
today and if I know that we need to fix
 
07:35:24.948 --> 07:35:24.958 align:start position:0%
the huge inequities in our health care
 
07:35:27.270 --> 07:35:27.280 align:start position:0%
and Social Services System that
 
07:35:29.910 --> 07:35:29.920 align:start position:0%
vulnerable populations experience so
 
07:35:31.670 --> 07:35:31.680 align:start position:0%
that they are able to enjoy the full
 
07:35:34.868 --> 07:35:34.878 align:start position:0%
autonomy of their bodies that most of us
 
07:35:37.468 --> 07:35:37.478 align:start position:0%
already enjoy and so that they can lead
 
07:35:39.110 --> 07:35:39.120 align:start position:0%
the rich and fulfilling life that they
 
07:35:42.230 --> 07:35:42.240 align:start position:0%
are entitled to before they die and
 
07:35:45.350 --> 07:35:45.360 align:start position:0%
finally if I know that hb1
 
07:35:48.350 --> 07:35:48.360 align:start position:0%
1283 does not adequately answer the
 
07:35:50.788 --> 07:35:50.798 align:start position:0%
question what will happen to my child
 
07:35:54.070 --> 07:35:54.080 align:start position:0%
when I am gone that so many parents are
 
07:35:57.270 --> 07:35:57.280 align:start position:0%
asking themselves right now would I now
 
07:35:59.750 --> 07:35:59.760 align:start position:0%
press the red button on the motion of
 
07:36:04.230 --> 07:36:04.240 align:start position:0%
 
07:36:06.270 --> 07:36:06.280 align:start position:0%
1283 representative Phillips is
 
07:36:12.150 --> 07:36:12.160 align:start position:0%
 
07:36:15.070 --> 07:36:15.080 align:start position:0%
inquiry thank you Mr Speaker hello again
 
07:36:17.868 --> 07:36:17.878 align:start position:0%
if I know this bill is rooted in
 
07:36:20.190 --> 07:36:20.200 align:start position:0%
compassion offering those nearing the
 
07:36:22.430 --> 07:36:22.440 align:start position:0%
end of their lives the dignity to end
 
07:36:25.670 --> 07:36:25.680 align:start position:0%
their suffering if they so choose if I
 
07:36:27.388 --> 07:36:27.398 align:start position:0%
know this bill embodies
 
07:36:30.350 --> 07:36:30.360 align:start position:0%
Freedom recognizing each individual's
 
07:36:32.708 --> 07:36:32.718 align:start position:0%
right to make decisions about their own
 
07:36:35.548 --> 07:36:35.558 align:start position:0%
death in alignment with their values
 
07:36:40.350 --> 07:36:40.360 align:start position:0%
conscience and Faith free from external
 
07:36:44.150 --> 07:36:44.160 align:start position:0%
influence moreover if I know it reflects
 
07:36:47.708 --> 07:36:47.718 align:start position:0%
Reason by drawing on a foundation of
 
07:36:50.388 --> 07:36:50.398 align:start position:0%

07:48:30.548 --> 07:48:30.558 align:start position:0%
Speaker if I know know that this bill
 
07:48:32.590 --> 07:48:32.600 align:start position:0%
attempts to misuse and distort our
 
07:48:34.708 --> 07:48:34.718 align:start position:0%
state's medical malpractice laws to
 
07:48:37.350 --> 07:48:37.360 align:start position:0%
restrict access to gender affirming care
 
07:48:40.468 --> 07:48:40.478 align:start position:0%
in ways that are completely unrelated to
 
07:48:44.190 --> 07:48:44.200 align:start position:0%
any errors in medical care or prior um
 
07:48:47.230 --> 07:48:47.240 align:start position:0%
consent and if I know that it introduces
 
07:48:51.350 --> 07:48:51.360 align:start position:0%
a range of uh Provisions into medical
 
07:48:54.308 --> 07:48:54.318 align:start position:0%
tort law that violate long-standing
 
07:48:57.948 --> 07:48:57.958 align:start position:0%
precedence in terms of establishing inj
 
07:48:59.788 --> 07:48:59.798 align:start position:0%
any injury
 
07:49:01.948 --> 07:49:01.958 align:start position:0%
or any malpractice on the part of the
 
07:49:06.388 --> 07:49:06.398 align:start position:0%
provider and expands the
 
07:49:09.670 --> 07:49:09.680 align:start position:0%
the uh statute of
 
07:49:11.948 --> 07:49:11.958 align:start position:0%
limitations in in ways that are
 
07:49:15.030 --> 07:49:15.040 align:start position:0%
completely unprecedented and finally if
 
07:49:17.708 --> 07:49:17.718 align:start position:0%
I know that it eliminates the burden of
 
07:49:19.510 --> 07:49:19.520 align:start position:0%
proof normally
 
07:49:23.948 --> 07:49:23.958 align:start position:0%

Granger thank you Mr speaker folks I'd
 
07:52:01.548 --> 07:52:01.558 align:start position:0%
like to tell you a short story some of
 
07:52:02.830 --> 07:52:02.840 align:start position:0%
you may have already heard it but about
 
07:52:05.788 --> 07:52:05.798 align:start position:0%
4,000 years ago Abraham's wife Sarah
 
07:52:07.868 --> 07:52:07.878 align:start position:0%
died he needed to bury her so he
 
07:52:10.150 --> 07:52:10.160 align:start position:0%
purchased a field for 400
 
07:52:13.910 --> 07:52:13.920 align:start position:0%
shekels 400 shekels is 145 Troy o of
 
07:52:16.270 --> 07:52:16.280 align:start position:0%
silver one troy ounce of silver is worth
 
07:52:18.708 --> 07:52:18.718 align:start position:0%
$25 so that means the value of the field
 
07:52:22.670 --> 07:52:22.680 align:start position:0%
 
07:52:25.070 --> 07:52:25.080 align:start position:0%
$3,625 using the power of the internet I
 
07:52:27.350 --> 07:52:27.360 align:start position:0%
have found land in Jordan that can be
 
07:52:29.308 --> 07:52:29.318 align:start position:0%
purchased for less than that
 
07:52:32.590 --> 07:52:32.600 align:start position:0%
amount 400 shekels can still buy a plot
 
07:52:36.190 --> 07:52:36.200 align:start position:0%
of land 4,000 years later now compare
 
07:52:37.750 --> 07:52:37.760 align:start position:0%
that to the dollar which has lost over
 
07:52:42.150 --> 07:52:42.160 align:start position:0%
90% of its value in less than 100 years
 
07:52:43.910 --> 07:52:43.920 align:start position:0%
this isn't a new phenomenon empires have
 
07:52:45.190 --> 07:52:45.200 align:start position:0%
been debasing their currencies
 
07:52:46.548 --> 07:52:46.558 align:start position:0%
practically since there have been
 
07:52:48.910 --> 07:52:48.920 align:start position:0%
Empires the US is not immune to the laws
 
07:52:50.468 --> 07:52:50.478 align:start position:0%
of Economics nor are they immune to the
 
07:52:52.948 --> 07:52:52.958 align:start position:0%
wages of time maybe the US will last
 
07:52:54.670 --> 07:52:54.680 align:start position:0%
another Thousand Years perhaps 2,000
 
07:52:56.948 --> 07:52:56.958 align:start position:0%
years the dollar however almost
 
07:52:58.868 --> 07:52:58.878 align:start position:0%
certainly will not last as long as the
 
07:53:01.110 --> 07:53:01.120 align:start position:0%
world Reserve currency at the current
 
07:53:02.308 --> 07:53:02.318 align:start position:0%
rate it is somewhat doubtful that it
 
07:53:04.150 --> 07:53:04.160 align:start position:0%
will even last another 10 years as the
 
07:53:06.670 --> 07:53:06.680 align:start position:0%
world Reserve currency in fact the
 
07:53:08.468 --> 07:53:08.478 align:start position:0%
Talking Heads have a new euphemism for
 
07:53:10.708 --> 07:53:10.718 align:start position:0%
it they call it dollarization you might
 
07:53:12.548 --> 07:53:12.558 align:start position:0%
have heard that term uh because it hits
 
07:53:15.110 --> 07:53:15.120 align:start position:0%
a lot softer than currency collapse it's
 
07:53:17.150 --> 07:53:17.160 align:start position:0%
showing up right about on time too as
 
07:53:19.628 --> 07:53:19.638 align:start position:0%
historically Reserve currencies lose
 
07:53:22.510 --> 07:53:22.520 align:start position:0%
dominance after about 80 to 100 years
 
07:53:24.270 --> 07:53:24.280 align:start position:0%
the dollar may very well join the Dutch
 
07:53:26.468 --> 07:53:26.478 align:start position:0%
Gilder the Spanish reel and the pound
 
07:53:29.350 --> 07:53:29.360 align:start position:0%
sterling as a former Reserve
 
07:53:31.548 --> 07:53:31.558 align:start position:0%
currency but when that happens people
 
07:53:33.868 --> 07:53:33.878 align:start position:0%
will still want to buy groceries I know
 
07:53:36.910 --> 07:53:36.920 align:start position:0%
I will therefore this is simply enabling
 
07:53:40.030 --> 07:53:40.040 align:start position:0%
legislation that legalizes wages to be
 
07:53:42.190 --> 07:53:42.200 align:start position:0%
paid in gold and silver it does not
 
07:53:44.070 --> 07:53:44.080 align:start position:0%
mandate that wages be paid in gold and
 
07:53:46.788 --> 07:53:46.798 align:start position:0%
silver it does not force employees to be
 
07:53:48.948 --> 07:53:48.958 align:start position:0%
PID to pay out in gold and or to be paid
 
07:53:50.868 --> 07:53:50.878 align:start position:0%
in gold and silver it does not force
 
07:53:53.070 --> 07:53:53.080 align:start position:0%
employers to pay in gold and silver if
 
07:53:54.510 --> 07:53:54.520 align:start position:0%
you do not want to be paid in gold and
 
07:53:56.590 --> 07:53:56.600 align:start position:0%
silver don't get paid if you don't want
 
07:53:58.548 --> 07:53:58.558 align:start position:0%
to pay in gold and silver don't pay
 
07:54:00.990 --> 07:54:01.000 align:start position:0%
people merely enabling legislation
 
07:54:04.110 --> 07:54:04.120 align:start position:0%
between two people who agree it has no
 
07:54:06.468 --> 07:54:06.478 align:start position:0%
impact on anyone in any way unless that
 
07:54:08.670 --> 07:54:08.680 align:start position:0%
person wants to be paid in gold and
 
07:54:10.910 --> 07:54:10.920 align:start position:0%
silver so I'd ask you to please oppose
 
07:54:13.150 --> 07:54:13.160 align:start position:0%
the itl motion uh thank you Mr Speaker
 
07:54:18.468 --> 07:54:18.478 align:start position:0%
 
07:54:26.590 --> 07:54:26.600 align:start position:0%
 
07:54:30.110 --> 07:54:30.120 align:start position:0%
Sullivan thank you Mr Speaker
 
07:54:33.468 --> 07:54:33.478 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker HB 1246 would allow an
 
07:54:37.110 --> 07:54:37.120 align:start position:0%
employer to pay employees in gold or
 
07:54:40.628 --> 07:54:40.638 align:start position:0%
silver I rise in support of the itl
 
07:54:44.510 --> 07:54:44.520 align:start position:0%
motion for this bill legal tender in the
 
07:54:48.270 --> 07:54:48.280 align:start position:0%
United States is the US dollar gold and
 
07:54:50.070 --> 07:54:50.080 align:start position:0%
silver are Commodities that change in
 
07:54:53.110 --> 07:54:53.120 align:start position:0%
value several times each day I would
 
07:54:55.590 --> 07:54:55.600 align:start position:0%
suggest that if you like gold and silver
 
07:54:58.350 --> 07:54:58.360 align:start position:0%
invest in gold and silver take your hard
 
07:55:01.070 --> 07:55:01.080 align:start position:0%
earned money your dollars and buy gold
 
07:55:03.910 --> 07:55:03.920 align:start position:0%
and silver it might be a good investment
 
07:55:06.110 --> 07:55:06.120 align:start position:0%
and all the more power too if you decide
 
07:55:07.270 --> 07:55:07.280 align:start position:0%
to do
 
07:55:09.948 --> 07:55:09.958 align:start position:0%
that it's impossible for an employer to
 
07:55:12.070 --> 07:55:12.080 align:start position:0%
know how much gold or silver valued in
 
07:55:14.350 --> 07:55:14.360 align:start position:0%
dollars an employer would provide to an
 
07:55:15.750 --> 07:55:15.760 align:start position:0%
employee to meet
 
07:55:18.510 --> 07:55:18.520 align:start position:0%
payroll the New Hampshire Department of
 
07:55:20.510 --> 07:55:20.520 align:start position:0%
Labor and the US Department of Labor
 
07:55:22.628 --> 07:55:22.638 align:start position:0%
have no Provisions for applying wage and
 
07:55:25.670 --> 07:55:25.680 align:start position:0%
labor laws for this form of
 
07:55:28.628 --> 07:55:28.638 align:start position:0%
compensation if payroll was somehow a
 
07:55:30.868 --> 07:55:30.878 align:start position:0%
accomplished an employee would be left
 
07:55:33.350 --> 07:55:33.360 align:start position:0%
with a ration of gold or silver unable
 
07:55:35.308 --> 07:55:35.318 align:start position:0%
to buy groceries until the precious
 
07:55:38.388 --> 07:55:38.398 align:start position:0%
metal was converted to doll dollars that
 
07:55:40.670 --> 07:55:40.680 align:start position:0%
conversion would involve paying a fee so
 
07:55:42.110 --> 07:55:42.120 align:start position:0%
the employee would lose a portion of
 
07:55:45.270 --> 07:55:45.280 align:start position:0%
their pay in order to spend it I also
 
07:55:47.708 --> 07:55:47.718 align:start position:0%
wonder where one would go to make that
 
07:55:50.628 --> 07:55:50.638 align:start position:0%
conversion this bill is unnecessary
 
07:55:53.190 --> 07:55:53.200 align:start position:0%
impractical and largely impossible to
 
07:55:56.230 --> 07:55:56.240 align:start position:0%
implement please join me in voting green
 
07:55:58.350 --> 07:55:58.360 align:start position:0%

Speaker if I know that this is simply
 
07:57:35.230 --> 07:57:35.240 align:start position:0%
enabling legislation that does not
 
07:57:37.830 --> 07:57:37.840 align:start position:0%

parties to
 
07:57:41.948 --> 07:57:41.958 align:start position:0%
agree if I know that the government
 
07:57:44.590 --> 07:57:44.600 align:start position:0%
tends to move too slow in a crisis
 
07:57:47.830 --> 07:57:47.840 align:start position:0%
situation to legislate on the spot if I
 
07:57:50.548 --> 07:57:50.558 align:start position:0%
know that this creates a legal path that
 
07:57:53.708 --> 07:57:53.718 align:start position:0%
in a crisis such as hyperinflation or

inquiry thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker
 
08:23:11.430 --> 08:23:11.440 align:start position:0%
if I know that by every metric New
 
08:23:13.750 --> 08:23:13.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is undergoing not only the
 
08:23:15.670 --> 08:23:15.680 align:start position:0%
worst housing crisis that we've ever
 
08:23:18.468 --> 08:23:18.478 align:start position:0%
experienced as a state but indeed our
 
08:23:20.628 --> 08:23:20.638 align:start position:0%
increase in homelessness is higher than
 
08:23:24.750 --> 08:23:24.760 align:start position:0%
any other state by increasing 52% a year
 
08:23:26.948 --> 08:23:26.958 align:start position:0%
and if I know that this bill is simply
 
08:23:30.110 --> 08:23:30.120 align:start position:0%
studying the feasibility of possibly
 
08:23:32.070 --> 08:23:32.080 align:start position:0%
creating a program that would eventually
 
08:23:34.990 --> 08:23:35.000 align:start position:0%
be at no cost to the state doing what
 
08:23:38.030 --> 08:23:38.040 align:start position:0%
banks already do for profit and if I
 
08:23:40.830 --> 08:23:40.840 align:start position:0%
know that we need to deal with the
 
08:23:42.548 --> 08:23:42.558 align:start position:0%
housing crisis or we will not have
 
08:23:44.910 --> 08:23:44.920 align:start position:0%
workers in this state in 15 years would
 
08:23:47.468 --> 08:23:47.478 align:start position:0%
I now vote red so that we can actually
 
08:23:49.590 --> 08:23:49.600 align:start position:0%

you Mr Speaker if I know multiple
 
08:24:00.788 --> 08:24:00.798 align:start position:0%
programs already exist in both the
 
08:24:03.548 --> 08:24:03.558 align:start position:0%
public and private sector that addresses
 
08:24:06.430 --> 08:24:06.440 align:start position:0%
the concerns of this bill and if I also
 
08:24:09.110 --> 08:24:09.120 align:start position:0%
know that we have seen the catastrophic
 
08:24:11.150 --> 08:24:11.160 align:start position:0%
results when politicians and bureaucrats
 
08:24:13.430 --> 08:24:13.440 align:start position:0%
insert themselves into these types of
 
08:24:17.270 --> 08:24:17.280 align:start position:0%
issues an example being the 20072 2008
 
08:24:21.070 --> 08:24:21.080 align:start position:0%

08:26:47.948 --> 08:26:47.958 align:start position:0%
change to their town meeting structure
 
08:26:49.910 --> 08:26:49.920 align:start position:0%
in the same manner they currently vote
 
08:26:52.750 --> 08:26:52.760 align:start position:0%
on nearly everything else the floor of
 
08:26:55.150 --> 08:26:55.160 align:start position:0%
the town meeting that way voters also
 
08:26:57.110 --> 08:26:57.120 align:start position:0%
have a chance to debate and discuss the
 
08:26:59.590 --> 08:26:59.600 align:start position:0%
question putting it on the ballot takes
 
08:27:02.990 --> 08:27:03.000 align:start position:0%
that critical voice away from the voter
 
08:27:04.830 --> 08:27:04.840 align:start position:0%
proponents of the town meeting emphasize
 
08:27:07.708 --> 08:27:07.718 align:start position:0%
that it is the purest form of democracy
 
08:27:09.910 --> 08:27:09.920 align:start position:0%
it ensures that all policy decisions are
 
08:27:11.708 --> 08:27:11.718 align:start position:0%
in the public interest since no
 
08:27:13.750 --> 08:27:13.760 align:start position:0%
intermediaries are placed between the
 
08:27:16.150 --> 08:27:16.160 align:start position:0%
voter and the public decisions this
 
08:27:18.430 --> 08:27:18.440 align:start position:0%
format allows for any and all citizens
 
08:27:20.910 --> 08:27:20.920 align:start position:0%
to directly debate and vote on
 
08:27:22.830 --> 08:27:22.840 align:start position:0%
legislation the process under the
 
08:27:24.628 --> 08:27:24.638 align:start position:0%
current law which requires the question
 
08:27:26.788 --> 08:27:26.798 align:start position:0%
of whether to adopt s SP2 to be voted on
 
08:27:29.548 --> 08:27:29.558 align:start position:0%
at the business section SE session not
 
08:27:32.510 --> 08:27:32.520 align:start position:0%
the ballot makes perfect sense the
 
08:27:33.910 --> 08:27:33.920 align:start position:0%
question of whether to fundamentally
 
08:27:35.468 --> 08:27:35.478 align:start position:0%
change your town government should be
 
08:27:39.228 --> 08:27:39.238 align:start position:0%
voted on voted in using the town's
 
08:27:42.510 --> 08:27:42.520 align:start position:0%
current process under this bill we would
 
08:27:46.270 --> 08:27:46.280 align:start position:0%
return to the illogical pre-2019 process
 
08:27:47.910 --> 08:27:47.920 align:start position:0%
where the voters in a traditional town
 
08:27:50.788 --> 08:27:50.798 align:start position:0%
meeting would vote on this important
 
08:27:53.468 --> 08:27:53.478 align:start position:0%
question the light went out I killed the
 
08:27:55.590 --> 08:27:55.600 align:start position:0%
light there it is uh would vote on this
 
08:27:57.070 --> 08:27:57.080 align:start position:0%
important question on the official
 
08:27:59.670 --> 08:27:59.680 align:start position:0%
ballot instead having only one public
 
08:28:01.948 --> 08:28:01.958 align:start position:0%
hearing which we know are poorly
 
08:28:04.070 --> 08:28:04.080 align:start position:0%
attended this bill would also strip
 
08:28:06.308 --> 08:28:06.318 align:start position:0%
voters of their opportunity to discuss
 
08:28:09.830 --> 08:28:09.840 align:start position:0%
and debate and really understand the sb2
 
08:28:12.150 --> 08:28:12.160 align:start position:0%
proposal before voting the question that
 
08:28:13.990 --> 08:28:14.000 align:start position:0%
would go on the ballot is prescribed by
 
08:28:17.110 --> 08:28:17.120 align:start position:0%
Statute and it merely says shall we
 
08:28:20.868 --> 08:28:20.878 align:start position:0%
adopt the provisions of RSA 40 colon 313
 
08:28:23.628 --> 08:28:23.638 align:start position:0%
known as SP2 to allow official Town
 
08:28:25.628 --> 08:28:25.638 align:start position:0%
ballot voting on all issues before the
 
08:28:27.788 --> 08:28:27.798 align:start position:0%
town on the second Tuesday of March or
 
08:28:31.548 --> 08:28:31.558 align:start position:0%
may or April that's it only the most
 
08:28:33.468 --> 08:28:33.478 align:start position:0%
diligent and informed voters have any
 
08:28:35.910 --> 08:28:35.920 align:start position:0%
idea what it means before they're voting
 
08:28:37.590 --> 08:28:37.600 align:start position:0%
what is the deliberative
 
08:28:40.510 --> 08:28:40.520 align:start position:0%
session what is the default budget how
 
08:28:42.788 --> 08:28:42.798 align:start position:0%
is the default budget calculated can the
 
08:28:45.190 --> 08:28:45.200 align:start position:0%
voters amend the default budget and many
 
08:28:47.868 --> 08:28:47.878 align:start position:0%
more questions what the current law does
 
08:28:50.150 --> 08:28:50.160 align:start position:0%
do is ensure that the questions get more
 
08:28:53.150 --> 08:28:53.160 align:start position:0%
careful consideration using a familiar
 
08:28:55.788 --> 08:28:55.798 align:start position:0%
format in 2019 the house Municipal and
 
08:28:57.628 --> 08:28:57.638 align:start position:0%
County government committee voted to
 
08:28:59.948 --> 08:28:59.958 align:start position:0%
recommend the bill to affect this change
 
08:29:03.430 --> 08:29:03.440 align:start position:0%
by an 18 to1 vote the vote in the house
 
08:29:07.190 --> 08:29:07.200 align:start position:0%
was on a Division vote it was 235 to
 
08:29:10.228 --> 08:29:10.238 align:start position:0%
122 it passed the senate committee
 
08:29:13.150 --> 08:29:13.160 align:start position:0%
unanimously and passed the Senate on a
 
08:29:15.708 --> 08:29:15.718 align:start position:0%
Voice vote for these reason I ask you to
 
08:29:18.070 --> 08:29:18.080 align:start position:0%
oppose the autop pass motion so that
 
08:29:21.468 --> 08:29:21.478 align:start position:0%
another motion can be made thank

Bill

08:29:39.990 --> 08:29:40.000 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
08:29:43.190 --> 08:29:43.200 align:start position:0%
1175 this bill restores the original
 
08:29:45.990 --> 08:29:46.000 align:start position:0%
method of adopting the official ballot
 
08:29:48.628 --> 08:29:48.638 align:start position:0%
referendum form of meeting commonly
 
08:29:52.628 --> 08:29:52.638 align:start position:0%
referred to as SP2 Mr Speaker for nearly
 
08:29:57.190 --> 08:29:57.200 align:start position:0%
25 years the question to adopt SP2 was
 
08:30:00.228 --> 08:30:00.238 align:start position:0%
placed on the official ballot and voters
 
08:30:04.030 --> 08:30:04.040 align:start position:0%
were able to vote on SP2 adoption at the
 
08:30:08.110 --> 08:30:08.120 align:start position:0%
polls on Town election day this process
 
08:30:11.350 --> 08:30:11.360 align:start position:0%
was wisely designed by legislators in
 
08:30:15.190 --> 08:30:15.200 align:start position:0%
1995 to avoid disenfranchising voters
 
08:30:18.750 --> 08:30:18.760 align:start position:0%
who could not attend the annual meeting
 
08:30:21.628 --> 08:30:21.638 align:start position:0%
voting for SP2 adoption on the official
 
08:30:25.308 --> 08:30:25.318 align:start position:0%
ballot was working very well for 24
 
08:30:28.430 --> 08:30:28.440 align:start position:0%
years I know this to be true because up
 
08:30:32.670 --> 08:30:32.680 align:start position:0%
until the change was made a total of 151
 
08:30:36.510 --> 08:30:36.520 align:start position:0%
towns and school districts successfully
 
08:30:41.190 --> 08:30:41.200 align:start position:0%
adopted the SP2 form of meeting then in
 
08:30:44.468 --> 08:30:44.478 align:start position:0%
2019 for no good reason there was a
 
08:30:47.070 --> 08:30:47.080 align:start position:0%
change in the law that made the adoption
 
08:30:50.430 --> 08:30:50.440 align:start position:0%
question a warrant article at the annual
 
08:30:53.468 --> 08:30:53.478 align:start position:0%
meeting requiring voters to attend the
 
08:30:56.468 --> 08:30:56.478 align:start position:0%
meeting to be able to vote on the on the
 
08:31:00.350 --> 08:31:00.360 align:start position:0%
question to adopt s SP2 consequently if
 
08:31:03.468 --> 08:31:03.478 align:start position:0%
a voter for whatever reason is unable to
 
08:31:06.228 --> 08:31:06.238 align:start position:0%
attend the annual meeting they are now
 
08:31:09.270 --> 08:31:09.280 align:start position:0%
denied the ability to vote for this very
 
08:31:12.948 --> 08:31:12.958 align:start position:0%
important change interestingly since the
 
08:31:16.830 --> 08:31:16.840 align:start position:0%
law was changed only one jurisdiction
 
08:31:20.868 --> 08:31:20.878 align:start position:0%
has adopted sb2 you heard me right just
 
08:31:23.990 --> 08:31:24.000 align:start position:0%
one out of 38 adoption
 
08:31:28.628 --> 08:31:28.638 align:start position:0%
attempts clearly since 2019 law change
 
08:31:32.070 --> 08:31:32.080 align:start position:0%
adoption of sb2 has essentially been
 
08:31:35.308 --> 08:31:35.318 align:start position:0%
held hostage ironically the current
 
08:31:38.308 --> 08:31:38.318 align:start position:0%
method of adopting SP2 at the annual
 
08:31:42.150 --> 08:31:42.160 align:start position:0%
meeting disenfranchises the same voters
 
08:31:45.308 --> 08:31:45.318 align:start position:0%
SP2 is intended to help which is why
 
08:31:48.430 --> 08:31:48.440 align:start position:0%
this bill is important disenfranchised
 
08:31:51.510 --> 08:31:51.520 align:start position:0%
voters include elderly disabled
 
08:31:54.468 --> 08:31:54.478 align:start position:0%
individuals people with health concerns
 
08:31:56.628 --> 08:31:56.638 align:start position:0%
couples with young children
 
08:31:59.388 --> 08:31:59.398 align:start position:0%
business Travelers college students
 
08:32:01.830 --> 08:32:01.840 align:start position:0%
snowbirds night and weekend shift
 
08:32:05.430 --> 08:32:05.440 align:start position:0%
employees military members and more all
 
08:32:08.228 --> 08:32:08.238 align:start position:0%
of these voters are disenfranchised as a
 
08:32:11.030 --> 08:32:11.040 align:start position:0%
result of the law change and most of
 
08:32:13.270 --> 08:32:13.280 align:start position:0%
these disenfranchise voters are
 
08:32:16.468 --> 08:32:16.478 align:start position:0%
interested in SP2 because it enables
 
08:32:20.070 --> 08:32:20.080 align:start position:0%
their voices to be heard at The Ballot
 
08:32:22.868 --> 08:32:22.878 align:start position:0%
Box it's ironic that these citizens
 
08:32:24.868 --> 08:32:24.878 align:start position:0%
cannot attend the traditional meeting to
 
08:32:28.150 --> 08:32:28.160 align:start position:0%
vote to adopt SP2 which is exactly the
 
08:32:30.510 --> 08:32:30.520 align:start position:0%
meeting system that would eliminate
 
08:32:30.520 --> 08:32:31.788 align:start position:0%
meeting system that would eliminate
their

08:32:31.788 --> 08:32:31.798 align:start position:0%
their
 
08:32:34.830 --> 08:32:34.840 align:start position:0%
disenfranchisement and lastly Mr Speaker
 
08:32:36.910 --> 08:32:36.920 align:start position:0%
it is important to note that the data
 
08:32:40.190 --> 08:32:40.200 align:start position:0%
consistently shows that many more voters
 
08:32:43.468 --> 08:32:43.478 align:start position:0%
cast ballots on Election Day than are
 
08:32:44.628 --> 08:32:44.638 align:start position:0%
able to
 
08:32:47.750 --> 08:32:47.760 align:start position:0%
participate at an annual meeting when
 
08:32:50.190 --> 08:32:50.200 align:start position:0%
more people are able to vote and have
 
08:32:53.868 --> 08:32:53.878 align:start position:0%
their voices heard this provides better
 
08:32:56.110 --> 08:32:56.120 align:start position:0%
representation of the will of of the
 
08:32:59.430 --> 08:32:59.440 align:start position:0%
people in a town or a school district in
 
08:33:02.228 --> 08:33:02.238 align:start position:0%
making the decision as to whether or not
 
08:33:06.708 --> 08:33:06.718 align:start position:0%
to to adopt SP2 for these reasons I urge
 
08:33:09.468 --> 08:33:09.478 align:start position:0%
my fellow colleagues to support the UT
 
08:33:12.750 --> 08:33:12.760 align:start position:0%
to pass motion by voting yes on House
 
08:33:12.760 --> 08:33:13.788 align:start position:0%
to pass motion by voting yes on House

question to adopt s SP2 was an official
 
08:35:25.910 --> 08:35:25.920 align:start position:0%
ballot question to ensure that voters
 
08:35:27.030 --> 08:35:27.040 align:start position:0%

disenfranchised and if I know that for
 
08:35:31.628 --> 08:35:31.638 align:start position:0%
no good reason the question to adopt s
 
08:35:34.708 --> 08:35:34.718 align:start position:0%
SP2 was changed to a vote at the annual
 
08:35:37.430 --> 08:35:37.440 align:start position:0%
meeting a change that without a doubt
 
08:35:39.510 --> 08:35:39.520 align:start position:0%
has disenfranchised many classes of
 
08:35:42.788 --> 08:35:42.798 align:start position:0%
Voters and has in effect stopped SP2
 
08:35:45.750 --> 08:35:45.760 align:start position:0%
from being adopted and if I further know
 
08:35:49.468 --> 08:35:49.478 align:start position:0%
that this bill fixes the problem by
 
08:35:52.308 --> 08:35:52.318 align:start position:0%
placing the question to adopt SP2 back
 
08:35:54.990 --> 08:35:55.000 align:start position:0%
onto the official ballot ensuring that
 
08:35:56.510 --> 08:35:56.520 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker if if I
 
08:39:38.830 --> 08:39:38.840 align:start position:0%
know that since
 
08:39:41.150 --> 08:39:41.160 align:start position:0%
1856 Commissioners in straford County
 
08:39:43.548 --> 08:39:43.558 align:start position:0%
have been elected at large and that over
 
08:39:46.750 --> 08:39:46.760 align:start position:0%
the last four years straford county has
 
08:39:48.708 --> 08:39:48.718 align:start position:0%
six elections that had no Republicans on
 
08:39:50.468 --> 08:39:50.478 align:start position:0%
the ballot and another 15 times that
 
08:39:51.910 --> 08:39:51.920 align:start position:0%
Republicans did not fill all the
 
08:39:54.110 --> 08:39:54.120 align:start position:0%
positions on the ballot and if I know
 
08:39:55.990 --> 08:39:56.000 align:start position:0%
over the same period we would have 16
 
08:39:58.030 --> 08:39:58.040 align:start position:0%
different County Commissioners six of
 
08:39:59.628 --> 08:39:59.638 align:start position:0%
those have been good Republican
 
08:40:02.070 --> 08:40:02.080 align:start position:0%
Commissioners if I know further that for
 
08:40:04.110 --> 08:40:04.120 align:start position:0%
many of those years Republicans held
 
08:40:06.190 --> 08:40:06.200 align:start position:0%
countywide positions of County sheriff
 
08:40:07.110 --> 08:40:07.120 align:start position:0%
and County
 
08:40:09.030 --> 08:40:09.040 align:start position:0%
Treasurer and fact I know that in the
 
08:40:11.070 --> 08:40:11.080 align:start position:0%
last 10 elections towns have had elected
 
08:40:13.228 --> 08:40:13.238 align:start position:0%
representation in nine of those
 
08:40:16.190 --> 08:40:16.200 align:start position:0%
elections and I know if you run good
 
08:40:19.750 --> 08:40:19.760 align:start position:0%
candidates you win elections what I now
 
08:40:22.350 --> 08:40:22.360 align:start position:0%
push the red button so that another
 
08:40:24.228 --> 08:40:24.238 align:start position:0%

made

08:40:26.948 --> 08:40:26.958 align:start position:0%

turot thank you Mr
 
08:40:36.270 --> 08:40:36.280 align:start position:0%
Speaker if I know it was just last year
 
08:40:39.150 --> 08:40:39.160 align:start position:0%
that after many decades straford County
 
08:40:40.750 --> 08:40:40.760 align:start position:0%
joined the other nine New Hampshire
 
08:40:42.590 --> 08:40:42.600 align:start position:0%
counties to have their Commissioners
 
08:40:45.590 --> 08:40:45.600 align:start position:0%
elected by district and not at
 
08:40:48.030 --> 08:40:48.040 align:start position:0%
large and if I know there is nothing
 
08:40:49.590 --> 08:40:49.600 align:start position:0%
more that the three current
 
08:40:52.548 --> 08:40:52.558 align:start position:0%
Commissioners would love to go back and
 
08:40:54.510 --> 08:40:54.520 align:start position:0%
continue the days when there was no need
 
08:40:55.948 --> 08:40:55.958 align:start position:0%
to campaign
 
08:40:58.910 --> 08:40:58.920 align:start position:0%
due to an atlarge countywide District
 
08:41:01.228 --> 08:41:01.238 align:start position:0%
that was gerrymandered by
 
08:41:03.948 --> 08:41:03.958 align:start position:0%
default and if I know the legislation
 
08:41:07.750 --> 08:41:07.760 align:start position:0%
passed last year to D District district
 
08:41:10.948 --> 08:41:10.958 align:start position:0%
straford county for the first time will
 
08:41:13.228 --> 08:41:13.238 align:start position:0%
give the Republicans who live in
 
08:41:16.548 --> 08:41:16.558 align:start position:0%
straford County who make up 49 42% of
 
08:41:19.228 --> 08:41:19.238 align:start position:0%
the electorate uh
 
08:41:22.190 --> 08:41:22.200 align:start position:0%

08:41:24.388 --> 08:41:24.398 align:start position:0%

08:41:27.228 --> 08:41:27.238 align:start position:0%

turot thank you Mr
 
08:47:13.868 --> 08:47:13.878 align:start position:0%
Speaker hb1 1210 is nothing more than a
 
08:47:15.468 --> 08:47:15.478 align:start position:0%
partisan attempt to overturn the
 
08:47:18.308 --> 08:47:18.318 align:start position:0%
legislation that we passed uh signed n
 
08:47:21.190 --> 08:47:21.200 align:start position:0%
was passed and signed into law last year
 
08:47:24.150 --> 08:47:24.160 align:start position:0%
straford County was the only one of 10
 
08:47:26.308 --> 08:47:26.318 align:start position:0%
counties in our our entire state that
 
08:47:28.150 --> 08:47:28.160 align:start position:0%
elected their Commissioners at large
 
08:47:29.548 --> 08:47:29.558 align:start position:0%
rather than by
 
08:47:33.708 --> 08:47:33.718 align:start position:0%
District in a county that is 58 42
 
08:47:35.070 --> 08:47:35.080 align:start position:0%
Democrat to
 
08:47:37.590 --> 08:47:37.600 align:start position:0%
Republican one can see why all the
 
08:47:39.190 --> 08:47:39.200 align:start position:0%
current Democrat straford County
 
08:47:41.070 --> 08:47:41.080 align:start position:0%
Commissioners and the delegation members
 
08:47:42.430 --> 08:47:42.440 align:start position:0%
want to
 
08:47:44.750 --> 08:47:44.760 align:start position:0%
see the law
 
08:47:48.868 --> 08:47:48.878 align:start position:0%
reversed in the last 40 years only two
 
08:47:50.990 --> 08:47:51.000 align:start position:0%
Republicans were elected as
 
08:47:53.990 --> 08:47:54.000 align:start position:0%
Commissioners out of a possible 60
 
08:47:57.110 --> 08:47:57.120 align:start position:0%
electoral plots hardly representative of
 
08:48:00.070 --> 08:48:00.080 align:start position:0%
the 42% of us Republicans who live in
 
08:48:00.080 --> 08:48:00.948 align:start position:0%
the 42% of us Republicans who live in
the

08:48:00.948 --> 08:48:00.958 align:start position:0%
the
 
08:48:04.388 --> 08:48:04.398 align:start position:0%
county reversing last year's legislation
 
08:48:06.628 --> 08:48:06.638 align:start position:0%
which created districts for the first
 
08:48:09.350 --> 08:48:09.360 align:start position:0%
time districts not
 
08:48:11.628 --> 08:48:11.638 align:start position:0%
redistricting we returned straford
 
08:48:13.510 --> 08:48:13.520 align:start position:0%
County to the geremander by default
 
08:48:16.308 --> 08:48:16.318 align:start position:0%
County that it has been thus continuing
 
08:48:18.750 --> 08:48:18.760 align:start position:0%
the voter disenfranchisement of the last
 
08:48:18.760 --> 08:48:22.388 align:start position:0%
the voter disenfranchisement of the last
four

08:48:22.388 --> 08:48:22.398 align:start position:0%
 
08:48:25.270 --> 08:48:25.280 align:start position:0%
decades if we went back
 
08:48:30.228 --> 08:48:30.238 align:start position:0%
to a county where the Commissioners were
 
08:48:31.788 --> 08:48:31.798 align:start position:0%
elected at
 
08:48:35.150 --> 08:48:35.160 align:start position:0%
large you would have in fact a jander
 
08:48:38.030 --> 08:48:38.040 align:start position:0%
county and what's jander what does that
 
08:48:40.990 --> 08:48:41.000 align:start position:0%
mean to intentionally create politic
 
08:48:43.110 --> 08:48:43.120 align:start position:0%
dist political districts that greatly
 
08:48:45.708 --> 08:48:45.718 align:start position:0%
favor one party over the other and
 
08:48:47.388 --> 08:48:47.398 align:start position:0%
that's exactly what has been going on in
 
08:48:50.308 --> 08:48:50.318 align:start position:0%
straford County for the last 40
 
08:48:53.270 --> 08:48:53.280 align:start position:0%
years now we've heard the
 
08:48:56.110 --> 08:48:56.120 align:start position:0%
commissioner mcair of our County
 
08:48:57.948 --> 08:48:57.958 align:start position:0%
mentioned multiple
 
08:49:00.910 --> 08:49:00.920 align:start position:0%
times that this is unconstitutional in
 
08:49:02.750 --> 08:49:02.760 align:start position:0%
fact it is not
 
08:49:05.468 --> 08:49:05.478 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional uh Before the bill was
 
08:49:08.030 --> 08:49:08.040 align:start position:0%
went forward we contacted the Secretary
 
08:49:10.590 --> 08:49:10.600 align:start position:0%
of State he said it was absolutely
 
08:49:12.750 --> 08:49:12.760 align:start position:0%
acceptable and when Senator gray
 
08:49:14.708 --> 08:49:14.718 align:start position:0%
requested an interpretation from their
 
08:49:18.750 --> 08:49:18.760 align:start position:0%
attorneys he ALS they also said it was
 
08:49:20.548 --> 08:49:20.558 align:start position:0%
acceptable the other thing that we've
 
08:49:23.830 --> 08:49:23.840 align:start position:0%
heard over and over is it's been working
 
08:49:25.670 --> 08:49:25.680 align:start position:0%
fine as it is
 
08:49:27.670 --> 08:49:27.680 align:start position:0%
well yeah of course it has been working
 
08:49:29.270 --> 08:49:29.280 align:start position:0%
fine as it is when you have three
 
08:49:31.548 --> 08:49:31.558 align:start position:0%
Democrat individuals controlling the
 
08:49:34.228 --> 08:49:34.238 align:start position:0%
entire County without any uh
 
08:49:37.228 --> 08:49:37.238 align:start position:0%
counterbalance or checks and balances of
 
08:49:39.388 --> 08:49:39.398 align:start position:0%
course it works fine for
 
08:49:44.110 --> 08:49:44.120 align:start position:0%
them but with a 2414 delegation uh
 
08:49:47.228 --> 08:49:47.238 align:start position:0%
Democrat majority everything proceeds
 
08:49:48.910 --> 08:49:48.920 align:start position:0%
very smoothly for
 
08:49:51.590 --> 08:49:51.600 align:start position:0%
them the other thing commissioner mlar
 
08:49:53.830 --> 08:49:53.840 align:start position:0%
loves to say is we have had Republicans
 
08:49:56.468 --> 08:49:56.478 align:start position:0%
that we have worked with well yes but
 
08:49:58.628 --> 08:49:58.638 align:start position:0%
those have been sheriffs and registar of
 
08:50:01.548 --> 08:50:01.558 align:start position:0%
deeds and others in the county and as I
 
08:50:04.270 --> 08:50:04.280 align:start position:0%
said before only two Commissioners in
 
08:50:06.788 --> 08:50:06.798 align:start position:0%
the last 40 years have been elected as
 
08:50:10.270 --> 08:50:10.280 align:start position:0%
 
08:50:13.030 --> 08:50:13.040 align:start position:0%
County the association of counties came
 
08:50:14.590 --> 08:50:14.600 align:start position:0%
forth and
 
08:50:17.468 --> 08:50:17.478 align:start position:0%
recommended this in favor yet not one of
 
08:50:19.030 --> 08:50:19.040 align:start position:0%
the other Commissioners actually showed
 
08:50:21.830 --> 08:50:21.840 align:start position:0%
up to testify no written support no
 
08:50:21.840 --> 08:50:23.030 align:start position:0%
up to testify no written support no
voice

08:50:23.030 --> 08:50:23.040 align:start position:0%
voice
 
08:50:25.510 --> 08:50:25.520 align:start position:0%
support and I think it it's fair to say
 
08:50:28.388 --> 08:50:28.398 align:start position:0%
 
08:50:31.750 --> 08:50:31.760 align:start position:0%
propose legislation that mandated every
 
08:50:34.150 --> 08:50:34.160 align:start position:0%
County be elected at large I bet you
 
08:50:37.190 --> 08:50:37.200 align:start position:0%
you'd have some uh Commissioners in here
 
08:50:41.190 --> 08:50:41.200 align:start position:0%
belly aing about that so uh I would ask
 
08:50:46.468 --> 08:50:46.478 align:start position:0%
that you uh vote red on the OTP motion
 
08:50:49.670 --> 08:50:49.680 align:start position:0%
so a motion of itl can be made thank you
 
08:50:53.548 --> 08:50:53.558 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker you recognize representative
 
08:50:53.558 --> 08:50:58.270 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker you recognize representative
stavas

08:50:58.270 --> 08:50:58.280 align:start position:0%
 
08:51:00.228 --> 08:51:00.238 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr
 
08:51:03.030 --> 08:51:03.040 align:start position:0%
Speaker Mr Speaker without passage of
 
08:51:07.308 --> 08:51:07.318 align:start position:0%
hb1 1210 limiting redistricted to once
 
08:51:10.868 --> 08:51:10.878 align:start position:0%
every 10 years no second bites at the
 
08:51:13.430 --> 08:51:13.440 align:start position:0%
Apple we could see districts
 
08:51:16.350 --> 08:51:16.360 align:start position:0%
flip-flopping every term depending on
 
08:51:17.868 --> 08:51:17.878 align:start position:0%
which party has the
 
08:51:20.628 --> 08:51:20.638 align:start position:0%
majority but this bill gives us a chance
 
08:51:23.708 --> 08:51:23.718 align:start position:0%
to avoid that kind of chaos and affirm
 
08:51:25.990 --> 08:51:26.000 align:start position:0%
that we expect people to follow the law
 
08:51:28.750 --> 08:51:28.760 align:start position:0%
and play by the rules and with respect
 
08:51:31.948 --> 08:51:31.958 align:start position:0%
to redistricting it's every 10
 
08:51:34.670 --> 08:51:34.680 align:start position:0%
years it's been clear from the outset
 
08:51:36.510 --> 08:51:36.520 align:start position:0%
that the majority of straford County
 
08:51:39.548 --> 08:51:39.558 align:start position:0%
voters did not want their District
 
08:51:43.110 --> 08:51:43.120 align:start position:0%
divided when hp75 was first presented to
 
08:51:45.868 --> 08:51:45.878 align:start position:0%
our committee we asked why it hadn't
 
08:51:48.670 --> 08:51:48.680 align:start position:0%
been dealt with at the appropriate time
 
08:51:50.708 --> 08:51:50.718 align:start position:0%
and the answer was that it would have
 
08:51:53.750 --> 08:51:53.760 align:start position:0%
and I quote muddied the waters and
 
08:51:56.228 --> 08:51:56.238 align:start position:0%
somehow the there wasn't
 
08:51:59.910 --> 08:51:59.920 align:start position:0%
time but those Waters were pretty clear
 
08:52:01.468 --> 08:52:01.478 align:start position:0%
since no one showed up at the
 
08:52:03.628 --> 08:52:03.638 align:start position:0%
redistricting hearings meant to gather
 
08:52:07.628 --> 08:52:07.638 align:start position:0%
public input as for there not being time
 
08:52:09.948 --> 08:52:09.958 align:start position:0%
why were was there time to make changes
 
08:52:12.750 --> 08:52:12.760 align:start position:0%
elsewhere but not in straford
 
08:52:16.750 --> 08:52:16.760 align:start position:0%
County Mr Speaker all we have to fall
 
08:52:21.468 --> 08:52:21.478 align:start position:0%
back on here are rules and laws hb1 1210
 
08:52:24.190 --> 08:52:24.200 align:start position:0%
does nothing more than insist we follow
 
08:52:27.070 --> 08:52:27.080 align:start position:0%
the rules we ourselves have
 
08:52:30.030 --> 08:52:30.040 align:start position:0%
endorsed if we don't we'll be fighting
 
08:52:33.388 --> 08:52:33.398 align:start position:0%
this battle every term every session and
 
08:52:35.070 --> 08:52:35.080 align:start position:0%
probably in every
 
08:52:38.350 --> 08:52:38.360 align:start position:0%
County Mr Speaker I urge my colleagues
 
08:52:41.868 --> 08:52:41.878 align:start position:0%
to vote out to pass on hb12 10 let's

stop playing political political games
 
08:52:47.510 --> 08:52:47.520 align:start position:0%
by following the rules only when they're
 
08:52:50.150 --> 08:52:50.160 align:start position:0%
in our favor that's not what we were

really
 
08:56:47.468 --> 08:56:47.478 align:start position:0%

County was redistricted outside of that

that cycle is to align with the census
 
08:57:03.750 --> 08:57:03.760 align:start position:0%

well-intentioned bill that might well
 
09:08:07.030 --> 09:08:07.040 align:start position:0%
add additional housing stock to our
 
09:08:09.548 --> 09:08:09.558 align:start position:0%
state which we sorely need but that
 
09:08:11.428 --> 09:08:11.438 align:start position:0%
there are several technical
 
09:08:15.068 --> 09:08:15.078 align:start position:0%
flaws mly having to regarding Life
 
09:08:17.588 --> 09:08:17.598 align:start position:0%
Safety codes that need to be addressed
 
09:08:19.830 --> 09:08:19.840 align:start position:0%
and if I further know that much more
 
09:08:21.548 --> 09:08:21.558 align:start position:0%
work needs to be done on this bill
 
09:08:23.790 --> 09:08:23.800 align:start position:0%
before it can be considered an in a much
 
09:08:26.030 --> 09:08:26.040 align:start position:0%
more full way would I now press the
 
09:08:27.790 --> 09:08:27.800 align:start position:0%
green button to support the tabling
 
09:08:32.030 --> 09:08:32.040 align:start position:0%
 
09:08:34.310 --> 09:08:34.320 align:start position:0%
Speaker the question is where the Lous
 
09:08:48.268 --> 09:08:48.278 align:start position:0%
 
09:08:51.428 --> 09:08:51.438 align:start position:0%
reason there's no hope for
 
09:08:53.868 --> 09:08:53.878 align:start position:0%
me so the question is whether little a
 
09:08:56.310 --> 09:08:56.320 align:start position:0%
house bill 1281 on the table and for
 
09:08:58.630 --> 09:08:58.640 align:start position:0%
some inexplicable reason it's a division

of great importance to the Democratic

Integrity of our
 
09:15:35.630 --> 09:15:35.640 align:start position:0%
state the recent decision to extend the
 
09:15:37.548 --> 09:15:37.558 align:start position:0%
terms of Rockingham County officers from
 
09:15:39.670 --> 09:15:39.680 align:start position:0%
two to four years on the under the guise
 
09:15:42.030 --> 09:15:42.040 align:start position:0%
of reducing campaign burdens was a
 
09:15:44.150 --> 09:15:44.160 align:start position:0%
misstep that threatens the very
 
09:15:45.790 --> 09:15:45.800 align:start position:0%
Foundation of accountable
 
09:15:48.388 --> 09:15:48.398 align:start position:0%
government now we stand at a precipice
 
09:15:51.030 --> 09:15:51.040 align:start position:0%
of further entrenching this error by
 
09:15:53.748 --> 09:15:53.758 align:start position:0%
extending the same extended terms to
 
09:15:56.190 --> 09:15:56.200 align:start position:0%
Coos County officers while the idea of
 
09:15:59.030 --> 09:15:59.040 align:start position:0%
campaigning less may seem appealing on
 
09:15:59.040 --> 09:16:00.268 align:start position:0%
campaigning less may seem appealing on
the

09:16:00.268 --> 09:16:00.278 align:start position:0%
the
 
09:16:02.908 --> 09:16:02.918 align:start position:0%
surface we must remember that the core
 
09:16:05.030 --> 09:16:05.040 align:start position:0%
principle is at stake here
 
09:16:07.950 --> 09:16:07.960 align:start position:0%
accountability to the people we serve
 
09:16:10.748 --> 09:16:10.758 align:start position:0%
elections are not just inconveniences to
 
09:16:13.748 --> 09:16:13.758 align:start position:0%
be avoided they are the lifeblood of our
 
09:16:16.588 --> 09:16:16.598 align:start position:0%
democracy the means by which the
 
09:16:19.510 --> 09:16:19.520 align:start position:0%
electorate holds us their elected
 
09:16:21.708 --> 09:16:21.718 align:start position:0%
representatives accountable for our
 
09:16:24.588 --> 09:16:24.598 align:start position:0%
actions and decisions by extending the
 
09:16:28.510 --> 09:16:28.520 align:start position:0%
term of office we risk perpetuating and
 
09:16:31.068 --> 09:16:31.078 align:start position:0%
entrenching uh entrenchment of
 
09:16:33.150 --> 09:16:33.160 align:start position:0%
incumbents in power which could
 
09:16:35.112 --> 09:16:35.122 align:start position:0%
concentrate power in the hands of a few
 
09:16:37.630 --> 09:16:37.640 align:start position:0%
individuals or political parties longer
 
09:16:40.068 --> 09:16:40.078 align:start position:0%
terms provide a breeding ground for
 
09:16:42.548 --> 09:16:42.558 align:start position:0%
complacency and a barrier to entry for
 
09:16:46.510 --> 09:16:46.520 align:start position:0%
new voices and pre fresh
 
09:16:48.830 --> 09:16:48.840 align:start position:0%
perspectives this undermines the very
 
09:16:51.030 --> 09:16:51.040 align:start position:0%
essence of our democracy while
 
09:16:53.670 --> 09:16:53.680 align:start position:0%
competition and diversity of ideas
 
09:16:56.548 --> 09:16:56.558 align:start position:0%
should flourish shorter terms allow for
 
09:16:58.708 --> 09:16:58.718 align:start position:0%
greater flexibility and responsibility
 
09:17:01.990 --> 09:17:02.000 align:start position:0%
to emergent issues and adapting to
 
09:17:04.630 --> 09:17:04.640 align:start position:0%
changing circumstances they ensure that
 
09:17:06.670 --> 09:17:06.680 align:start position:0%
our government remains agile and
 
09:17:09.268 --> 09:17:09.278 align:start position:0%
responsive to the needs and aspirations
 
09:17:12.268 --> 09:17:12.278 align:start position:0%
of the people rather than stagnating
 
09:17:15.510 --> 09:17:15.520 align:start position:0%
under the weight of
 
09:17:18.228 --> 09:17:18.238 align:start position:0%
inertia would you vote for a governor to
 
09:17:20.228 --> 09:17:20.238 align:start position:0%
be elected every four years because the
 
09:17:22.030 --> 09:17:22.040 align:start position:0%
job is complicated and takes time to
 
09:17:22.040 --> 09:17:23.428 align:start position:0%
job is complicated and takes time to
learn

09:17:23.428 --> 09:17:23.438 align:start position:0%
learn
 
09:17:27.310 --> 09:17:27.320 align:start position:0%
I know I wouldn't in conclusion while
 
09:17:29.268 --> 09:17:29.278 align:start position:0%
the temptation to reduce the frequency
 
09:17:32.350 --> 09:17:32.360 align:start position:0%
of Elections may be understandable we
 
09:17:34.708 --> 09:17:34.718 align:start position:0%
must not lose sight of the fundamental
 
09:17:36.548 --> 09:17:36.558 align:start position:0%
importance of the accountability and
 
09:17:39.350 --> 09:17:39.360 align:start position:0%
responsivness in our de democratic
 
09:17:42.670 --> 09:17:42.680 align:start position:0%
system we must resist the all the Allure
 
09:17:46.908 --> 09:17:46.918 align:start position:0%
of prolonged uh terms and instead
 
09:17:48.428 --> 09:17:48.438 align:start position:0%
reaffirm the commitment to the
 
09:17:51.268 --> 09:17:51.278 align:start position:0%
principles of democracy transparency and
 
09:17:53.588 --> 09:17:53.598 align:start position:0%
accountability I urge my esteemed
 
09:17:56.068 --> 09:17:56.078 align:start position:0%
colleagues to reconsider the path we are

of our colleagues I want to thank the uh
 
09:25:04.630 --> 09:25:04.640 align:start position:0%
speaker for forming this special
 
09:25:06.230 --> 09:25:06.240 align:start position:0%
committee I believe this is the only
 
09:25:08.390 --> 09:25:08.400 align:start position:0%
Bill we had a divided vote on um so I
 
09:25:10.150 --> 09:25:10.160 align:start position:0%
wanted to thank the ranking member uh
 
09:25:11.670 --> 09:25:11.680 align:start position:0%
and everyone for working in good faith
 
09:25:13.510 --> 09:25:13.520 align:start position:0%
for so many accomplishments that being
 
09:25:15.790 --> 09:25:15.800 align:start position:0%
said let's get to the one we disagree on
 
09:25:18.350 --> 09:25:18.360 align:start position:0%
um this bill what it does is it
 
09:25:19.746 --> 09:25:19.756 align:start position:0%
increases the allowable number of
 
09:25:22.510 --> 09:25:22.520 align:start position:0%
children for at home care So currently
 
09:25:24.586 --> 09:25:24.596 align:start position:0%
that care is capped at three kids we're
 
09:25:26.950 --> 09:25:26.960 align:start position:0%
moving we want to move it to four kids
 
09:25:29.030 --> 09:25:29.040 align:start position:0%
when you're looking at this at home
 
09:25:30.830 --> 09:25:30.840 align:start position:0%
centers at home care they should not be
 
09:25:34.746 --> 09:25:34.756 align:start position:0%
called centers at home care is a vital
 
09:25:37.030 --> 09:25:37.040 align:start position:0%
Child Care delivery system for
 
09:25:38.426 --> 09:25:38.436 align:start position:0%
specifically rural communities that
 
09:25:41.350 --> 09:25:41.360 align:start position:0%
cannot support larger centers so when
 
09:25:42.906 --> 09:25:42.916 align:start position:0%
you're looking at the child care crisis
 
09:25:44.790 --> 09:25:44.800 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire we have a
 
09:25:47.510 --> 09:25:47.520 align:start position:0%
problem with access and affordability so
 
09:25:49.870 --> 09:25:49.880 align:start position:0%
the only ways to address access and
 
09:25:51.830 --> 09:25:51.840 align:start position:0%
affordability without running up a tax
 
09:25:54.670 --> 09:25:54.680 align:start position:0%
bill into the hundreds of millions is to
 
09:25:57.310 --> 09:25:57.320 align:start position:0%
increase the number of existing spots so
 
09:25:59.350 --> 09:25:59.360 align:start position:0%
this would increase access and
 
09:26:02.110 --> 09:26:02.120 align:start position:0%
affordability you must just just depose
 
09:26:04.470 --> 09:26:04.480 align:start position:0%
that against safety and quality the
 
09:26:06.266 --> 09:26:06.276 align:start position:0%
minority of the committee believed that
 
09:26:08.790 --> 09:26:08.800 align:start position:0%
going from three kids to four kids was
 
09:26:11.230 --> 09:26:11.240 align:start position:0%
worth the increase in Access and
 
09:26:13.790 --> 09:26:13.800 align:start position:0%
affordability and did not significantly
 
09:26:16.670 --> 09:26:16.680 align:start position:0%
diminish safety and quality so with that
 
09:26:19.746 --> 09:26:19.756 align:start position:0%
I would ask the the body to oppose the
 
09:26:21.870 --> 09:26:21.880 align:start position:0%
itl motion so that another motion can be
 
09:26:24.266 --> 09:26:24.276 align:start position:0%
made does a member yield for a
 
09:26:27.586 --> 09:26:27.596 align:start position:0%
question no member does not
 
09:26:29.746 --> 09:26:29.756 align:start position:0%

report thank you Mr
 
09:26:41.110 --> 09:26:41.120 align:start position:0%
Speaker HB 1584 aims to boost the
 
09:26:43.230 --> 09:26:43.240 align:start position:0%
capacity of New Hampshire's Child Care
 
09:26:46.746 --> 09:26:46.756 align:start position:0%
System it's a laudable goal which we all
 
09:26:49.906 --> 09:26:49.916 align:start position:0%
share the majority of committee however
 
09:26:51.990 --> 09:26:52.000 align:start position:0%
concluded that the life safety concerns
 
09:26:54.870 --> 09:26:54.880 align:start position:0%
the particular Bill creates are serious
 
09:26:57.150 --> 09:26:57.160 align:start position:0%
enough to reject it as a
 
09:26:59.746 --> 09:26:59.756 align:start position:0%
solution the bill aims to increase Child
 
09:27:02.390 --> 09:27:02.400 align:start position:0%
Care capacity by allowing unlicensed
 
09:27:04.470 --> 09:27:04.480 align:start position:0%
providers to care for four children
 
09:27:06.870 --> 09:27:06.880 align:start position:0%
instead of three in their homes these
 
09:27:09.906 --> 09:27:09.916 align:start position:0%
four children would be in addition to
 
09:27:12.150 --> 09:27:12.160 align:start position:0%
any of the providers own children who
 
09:27:13.586 --> 09:27:13.596 align:start position:0%
they are caring
 
09:27:16.230 --> 09:27:16.240 align:start position:0%
for while this change seems at first
 
09:27:18.670 --> 09:27:18.680 align:start position:0%
like a modest tweak it could have
 
09:27:21.110 --> 09:27:21.120 align:start position:0%
significant safety implications in
 
09:27:21.120 --> 09:27:22.746 align:start position:0%
significant safety implications in
emergencies

09:27:22.746 --> 09:27:22.756 align:start position:0%
emergencies
 
09:27:24.670 --> 09:27:24.680 align:start position:0%
the bill as written does not place any
 
09:27:27.670 --> 09:27:27.680 align:start position:0%
restriction on the ages of the children
 
09:27:30.790 --> 09:27:30.800 align:start position:0%
under care in other words a provider
 
09:27:33.670 --> 09:27:33.680 align:start position:0%
could be responsible for four or more
 
09:27:36.110 --> 09:27:36.120 align:start position:0%
infants during an emergency
 
09:27:39.190 --> 09:27:39.200 align:start position:0%
evacuation I ask you to imagine this
 
09:27:42.110 --> 09:27:42.120 align:start position:0%
situation during a fire in a second
 
09:27:44.230 --> 09:27:44.240 align:start position:0%
floor walkup
 
09:27:46.830 --> 09:27:46.840 align:start position:0%
apartment these safety concerns are
 
09:27:51.230 --> 09:27:51.240 align:start position:0%
exactly why we have a licensing category
 
09:27:53.790 --> 09:27:53.800 align:start position:0%
called family Child Care Homes
 
09:27:56.110 --> 09:27:56.120 align:start position:0%
specifically for providers caring for
 
09:27:58.710 --> 09:27:58.720 align:start position:0%
four to six children in their own
 
09:28:02.030 --> 09:28:02.040 align:start position:0%
homes the majority and minority agree
 
09:28:03.790 --> 09:28:03.800 align:start position:0%
that the child care shortage in New
 
09:28:06.510 --> 09:28:06.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is an acute crisis
 
09:28:08.390 --> 09:28:08.400 align:start position:0%
particularly when it comes to infant
 
09:28:10.510 --> 09:28:10.520 align:start position:0%
care and particularly in rural
 
09:28:11.990 --> 09:28:12.000 align:start position:0%
communities like
 
09:28:14.906 --> 09:28:14.916 align:start position:0%
mine the minority also acknowledges in
 
09:28:16.906 --> 09:28:16.916 align:start position:0%
the report that this bill will make
 
09:28:18.630 --> 09:28:18.640 align:start position:0%
child care less
 
09:28:21.110 --> 09:28:21.120 align:start position:0%
safe where we cannot reach agreement
 
09:28:23.510 --> 09:28:23.520 align:start position:0%
with the minority is in their conclusion
 
09:28:26.266 --> 09:28:26.276 align:start position:0%
that the compromises to Life Safety that
 
09:28:28.950 --> 09:28:28.960 align:start position:0%
this bill requires are an acceptable
 
09:28:31.550 --> 09:28:31.560 align:start position:0%
tradeoff for an only marginal increase
 
09:28:33.586 --> 09:28:33.596 align:start position:0%
in available infant care
 
09:28:36.470 --> 09:28:36.480 align:start position:0%
slots Additionally the bill will put
 
09:28:39.030 --> 09:28:39.040 align:start position:0%
more children into care with providers
 
09:28:42.070 --> 09:28:42.080 align:start position:0%
not subject to background check
 
09:28:45.586 --> 09:28:45.596 align:start position:0%
requirements to put it plainly we agree
 
09:28:49.390 --> 09:28:49.400 align:start position:0%
on the aim but not the
 
09:28:52.586 --> 09:28:52.596 align:start position:0%
means rather than compromising safety
 
09:28:54.230 --> 09:28:54.240 align:start position:0%
the majority believes our focus should
 
09:28:57.230 --> 09:28:57.240 align:start position:0%
be making it easier for providers to
 
09:28:59.426 --> 09:28:59.436 align:start position:0%
become licensed to care for four to six
 
09:29:02.150 --> 09:29:02.160 align:start position:0%
children in their homes for this reason

inquiry thank you Mr
 
09:30:31.190 --> 09:30:31.200 align:start position:0%
Speaker if I know that this bill simply
 
09:30:33.190 --> 09:30:33.200 align:start position:0%
increases the number of children who can
 
09:30:37.266 --> 09:30:37.276 align:start position:0%
be cared for in a home daycare by one
 
09:30:40.710 --> 09:30:40.720 align:start position:0%
child if I know that there is no impact
 
09:30:43.950 --> 09:30:43.960 align:start position:0%
on zoning or fire codes if I know that
 
09:30:46.426 --> 09:30:46.436 align:start position:0%
we need to increase access to child care
 
09:30:48.550 --> 09:30:48.560 align:start position:0%
and this bill does that with minimal
 
09:30:51.266 --> 09:30:51.276 align:start position:0%
government intervention and if I know
 
09:30:53.390 --> 09:30:53.400 align:start position:0%
that we trust trust parents to choose
 
09:30:55.310 --> 09:30:55.320 align:start position:0%
the best child care setting for their
 
09:30:57.630 --> 09:30:57.640 align:start position:0%

inquiry thank you Mr
 
09:31:14.310 --> 09:31:14.320 align:start position:0%
Speaker Mr Speaker if I know that this
 
09:31:17.710 --> 09:31:17.720 align:start position:0%
bill would allow up to four very young
 
09:31:20.030 --> 09:31:20.040 align:start position:0%
children to be cared for in an
 
09:31:22.950 --> 09:31:22.960 align:start position:0%
unlicensed Child Care Facility
 
09:31:25.110 --> 09:31:25.120 align:start position:0%
and that the four children could be in
 
09:31:26.950 --> 09:31:26.960 align:start position:0%
addition to the child care provider's
 
09:31:29.710 --> 09:31:29.720 align:start position:0%
own children and if I know that
 
09:31:32.790 --> 09:31:32.800 align:start position:0%
unlicensed Child Care means there are no
 
09:31:35.710 --> 09:31:35.720 align:start position:0%
safety checks on the facility by the
 
09:31:38.470 --> 09:31:38.480 align:start position:0%
fire or health department and that the
 
09:31:40.710 --> 09:31:40.720 align:start position:0%
provider does not have a criminal
 
09:31:43.990 --> 09:31:44.000 align:start position:0%
background check or any training in

first aid or
 
09:31:48.266 --> 09:31:48.276 align:start position:0%
CPR and if I know that expanding the
 
09:31:51.266 --> 09:31:51.276 align:start position:0%
number of children in unlicensed care
 
09:31:53.790 --> 09:31:53.800 align:start position:0%
will compromise the safety of our

the two big issues constraining our

economy one is a lack of affordable
 
09:42:01.830 --> 09:42:01.840 align:start position:0%

new subsidy program of potentially
 
09:45:44.080 --> 09:45:45.710 align:start position:0%
new subsidy program of potentially
breathtaking

09:45:45.710 --> 09:45:45.720 align:start position:0%
breathtaking
 
09:45:49.070 --> 09:45:49.080 align:start position:0%
scope this bill authorizes DHHS to
 
09:45:52.266 --> 09:45:52.276 align:start position:0%
designate an entity to award so-called
 
09:45:55.310 --> 09:45:55.320 align:start position:0%
flexible spending grants to eligible
 
09:45:58.586 --> 09:45:58.596 align:start position:0%
private sector Child Care employers who
 
09:46:00.510 --> 09:46:00.520 align:start position:0%
would then redistribute These funds
 
09:46:03.470 --> 09:46:03.480 align:start position:0%
amongst their employees to pay for an
 
09:46:05.790 --> 09:46:05.800 align:start position:0%
extensive array of employment
 
09:46:08.350 --> 09:46:08.360 align:start position:0%
benefits and even wage
 
09:46:11.830 --> 09:46:11.840 align:start position:0%
increases the bill includes no specific
 
09:46:14.670 --> 09:46:14.680 align:start position:0%
allowances for any of the numerous
 
09:46:18.906 --> 09:46:18.916 align:start position:0%
benefits no per employee caps and no
 
09:46:21.790 --> 09:46:21.800 align:start position:0%
qualifying criteria other than one
 
09:46:24.906 --> 09:46:24.916 align:start position:0%
simply must work in a Child Care Program
 
09:46:27.510 --> 09:46:27.520 align:start position:0%
and submit
 
09:46:30.150 --> 09:46:30.160 align:start position:0%
expenses though the bill makes no
 
09:46:33.390 --> 09:46:33.400 align:start position:0%
Appropriations request it is plainly
 
09:46:36.586 --> 09:46:36.596 align:start position:0%
intended as an empty vessel to be filled
 
09:46:40.390 --> 09:46:40.400 align:start position:0%
as much as possible as soon as possible
 
09:46:42.070 --> 09:46:42.080 align:start position:0%
with no clear
 
09:46:45.070 --> 09:46:45.080 align:start position:0%
limits even though its fiscal impact is
 
09:46:47.906 --> 09:46:47.916 align:start position:0%
therefore been deemed
 
09:46:49.950 --> 09:46:49.960 align:start position:0%
indeterminable and even though the bill
 
09:46:51.990 --> 09:46:52.000 align:start position:0%
offers virtually no guidance in its
 
09:46:55.030 --> 09:46:55.040 align:start position:0%
open-ended Grant of rulle making
 
09:46:58.230 --> 09:46:58.240 align:start position:0%
Authority proponents say the bill must
 
09:47:02.950 --> 09:47:02.960 align:start position:0%
be passed now in order for DHHS DHHS to
 
09:47:05.510 --> 09:47:05.520 align:start position:0%
begin fashioning rules so that the
 
09:47:08.106 --> 09:47:08.116 align:start position:0%
program will be ready to go when a
 
09:47:11.190 --> 09:47:11.200 align:start position:0%
future appropriation is made presumably
 
09:47:11.200 --> 09:47:12.470 align:start position:0%
future appropriation is made presumably
next

09:47:12.470 --> 09:47:12.480 align:start position:0%
next
 
09:47:16.310 --> 09:47:16.320 align:start position:0%
bium Mr Mr Speaker if you believe as I
 
09:47:19.350 --> 09:47:19.360 align:start position:0%
do that taxpayers should not be asked to
 
09:47:22.510 --> 09:47:22.520 align:start position:0%
fund a Cadillac benefits package or for
 
09:47:25.070 --> 09:47:25.080 align:start position:0%
that matter any employment benefits to
 
09:47:27.390 --> 09:47:27.400 align:start position:0%
private sector employees and that
 
09:47:30.030 --> 09:47:30.040 align:start position:0%
Solutions addressing the systemic
 
09:47:32.350 --> 09:47:32.360 align:start position:0%
challenges of running a child care
 
09:47:36.470 --> 09:47:36.480 align:start position:0%
center must instead focus on root causes
 
09:47:37.870 --> 09:47:37.880 align:start position:0%
then you will surely support the
 
09:47:41.870 --> 09:47:41.880 align:start position:0%
committee's recommended motion of
 
09:47:44.030 --> 09:47:44.040 align:start position:0%

Mr Speaker if I know that house bill
 
09:48:58.746 --> 09:48:58.756 align:start position:0%
1611 is a bipartisan bill that was
 
09:49:01.150 --> 09:49:01.160 align:start position:0%
passed unanimously out of the house
 
09:49:03.550 --> 09:49:03.560 align:start position:0%
special committee on child care and
 
09:49:05.746 --> 09:49:05.756 align:start position:0%

169 and Mr Speaker if I know that this
 
09:49:20.950 --> 09:49:20.960 align:start position:0%
is an economic tool with a single intent
 
09:49:23.426 --> 09:49:23.436 align:start position:0%
to establish the infrastructure of the
 
09:49:27.266 --> 09:49:27.276 align:start position:0%

09:49:38.586 --> 09:49:38.596 align:start position:0%

09:49:41.746 --> 09:49:41.756 align:start position:0%

Mr Speaker if I know that this bill
 
09:49:57.790 --> 09:49:57.800 align:start position:0%
while well-intentioned has no built-in
 
09:50:00.426 --> 09:50:00.436 align:start position:0%
guard rails to ensure that funding does
 
09:50:02.790 --> 09:50:02.800 align:start position:0%
not get out of control and if I know
 
09:50:05.070 --> 09:50:05.080 align:start position:0%
that the cost to administer the program
 
09:50:05.080 --> 09:50:05.870 align:start position:0%

is

09:50:05.870 --> 09:50:05.880 align:start position:0%
is
 
09:50:07.950 --> 09:50:07.960 align:start position:0%
indeterminable as specified in the

sure that this is fiscally
 
09:50:19.390 --> 09:50:19.400 align:start position:0%
