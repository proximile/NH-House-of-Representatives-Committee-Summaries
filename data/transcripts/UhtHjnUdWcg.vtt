00:08:36.070 --> 00:08:36.080 align:start position:0%

00:08:41.670 --> 00:08:41.680 align:start position:0%
just shy of a few days
 
00:08:44.780 --> 00:08:44.790 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:44.790 --> 00:08:51.350 align:start position:0%
 
[Applause]

00:08:51.350 --> 00:08:51.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:53.269 --> 00:08:53.279 align:start position:0%
we're going to go over a few things
 
00:08:55.350 --> 00:08:55.360 align:start position:0%
first paul's going to go over a few
 
00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:56.230 align:start position:0%
first paul's going to go over a few
things

00:08:56.230 --> 00:08:56.240 align:start position:0%
things
 
00:08:57.670 --> 00:08:57.680 align:start position:0%
and then we're actually going to get
 
00:08:57.680 --> 00:08:59.110 align:start position:0%
and then we're actually going to get
into

00:08:59.110 --> 00:08:59.120 align:start position:0%
into
 
00:09:02.070 --> 00:09:02.080 align:start position:0%
a discussion and
 
00:09:04.070 --> 00:09:04.080 align:start position:0%
there will be some people doing things
 
00:09:05.670 --> 00:09:05.680 align:start position:0%
they shouldn't do
 
00:09:07.430 --> 00:09:07.440 align:start position:0%
so that you'll know you shouldn't do
 
00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:09.910 align:start position:0%
so that you'll know you shouldn't do
them

00:09:09.910 --> 00:09:09.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:10.790 align:start position:0%
 
but

00:09:10.790 --> 00:09:10.800 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:09:13.430 --> 00:09:13.440 align:start position:0%
it's it's this is kind of like a dry run
 
00:09:15.910 --> 00:09:15.920 align:start position:0%
for a number of reasons making sure i
 
00:09:17.350 --> 00:09:17.360 align:start position:0%
mean they've tested the machines and
 
00:09:18.550 --> 00:09:18.560 align:start position:0%
making sure all the machines and
 
00:09:20.630 --> 00:09:20.640 align:start position:0%
everything work the voting machines and
 
00:09:25.110 --> 00:09:25.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:27.509 --> 00:09:27.519 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
00:09:30.630 --> 00:09:30.640 align:start position:0%
first off welcome back to your chamber
 
00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:31.910 align:start position:0%
first off welcome back to your chamber
the

00:09:31.910 --> 00:09:31.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:09:34.389 --> 00:09:34.399 align:start position:0%
purpose of today
 
00:09:36.790 --> 00:09:36.800 align:start position:0%
for for especially for many of our
 
00:09:39.030 --> 00:09:39.040 align:start position:0%
new members this is your first time
 
00:09:41.350 --> 00:09:41.360 align:start position:0%
being in representatives hall in this
 
00:09:43.670 --> 00:09:43.680 align:start position:0%
kind of setting so really what we wanted
 
00:09:44.550 --> 00:09:44.560 align:start position:0%
to do
 
00:09:47.030 --> 00:09:47.040 align:start position:0%
is sort of have a discussion about
 
00:09:49.509 --> 00:09:49.519 align:start position:0%
decorum in the chamber
 
00:09:51.590 --> 00:09:51.600 align:start position:0%
talk about
 
00:09:53.829 --> 00:09:53.839 align:start position:0%
some procedural things and that sort of
 
00:09:53.839 --> 00:09:54.790 align:start position:0%
some procedural things and that sort of
thing

00:09:54.790 --> 00:09:54.800 align:start position:0%
thing
 
00:09:57.670 --> 00:09:57.680 align:start position:0%
a few housekeeping things so first off
 
00:09:59.190 --> 00:09:59.200 align:start position:0%
welcome to those that are tuning in
 
00:10:02.949 --> 00:10:02.959 align:start position:0%
online via our our streaming video a
 
00:10:04.470 --> 00:10:04.480 align:start position:0%
couple points i want to make just for
 
00:10:06.630 --> 00:10:06.640 align:start position:0%
those that are watching online but also
 
00:10:09.110 --> 00:10:09.120 align:start position:0%
for you here if you desire to watch
 
00:10:11.110 --> 00:10:11.120 align:start position:0%
later on
 
00:10:13.509 --> 00:10:13.519 align:start position:0%
we're testing some different angles so
 
00:10:15.829 --> 00:10:15.839 align:start position:0%
you might notice that during the course
 
00:10:17.509 --> 00:10:17.519 align:start position:0%
of this there's going to be some
 
00:10:19.350 --> 00:10:19.360 align:start position:0%
close-ups and there's going to be some
 
00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:20.069 align:start position:0%
close-ups and there's going to be some
far

00:10:20.069 --> 00:10:20.079 align:start position:0%
far
 
00:10:22.069 --> 00:10:22.079 align:start position:0%
some far back shots and it's because
 
00:10:24.389 --> 00:10:24.399 align:start position:0%
we're trying to figure out the best way
 
00:10:26.470 --> 00:10:26.480 align:start position:0%
to to stream i will say
 
00:10:28.389 --> 00:10:28.399 align:start position:0%
that um this is the first time that
 
00:10:30.710 --> 00:10:30.720 align:start position:0%
we're going to see cameras and and the
 
00:10:33.350 --> 00:10:33.360 align:start position:0%
the definition of the cameras in this
 
00:10:35.190 --> 00:10:35.200 align:start position:0%
chamber the way they are and it's uh
 
00:10:38.150 --> 00:10:38.160 align:start position:0%
it's pretty it's pretty amazing so
 
00:10:41.509 --> 00:10:41.519 align:start position:0%
um i i hope you uh
 
00:10:44.150 --> 00:10:44.160 align:start position:0%
enjoy what you're going to see um that
 
00:10:46.949 --> 00:10:46.959 align:start position:0%
being said uh if if any of our members
 
00:10:48.310 --> 00:10:48.320 align:start position:0%
are watching
 
00:10:50.230 --> 00:10:50.240 align:start position:0%
you have my cell phone number and if
 
00:10:52.550 --> 00:10:52.560 align:start position:0%
you'd like to text me and ask questions
 
00:10:55.110 --> 00:10:55.120 align:start position:0%
please do we will address those in the
 
00:10:57.110 --> 00:10:57.120 align:start position:0%
course of the day
 
00:10:59.030 --> 00:10:59.040 align:start position:0%
i've given my number out so many times
 
00:11:00.870 --> 00:11:00.880 align:start position:0%
over social media and
 
00:11:02.630 --> 00:11:02.640 align:start position:0%
in streaming service i i feel like i've
 
00:11:03.990 --> 00:11:04.000 align:start position:0%
done it enough i just don't want to do
 
00:11:05.750 --> 00:11:05.760 align:start position:0%
it anymore
 
00:11:08.630 --> 00:11:08.640 align:start position:0%
so a couple couple things first off um
 
00:11:10.069 --> 00:11:10.079 align:start position:0%
when you're in the chamber and i hope
 
00:11:11.910 --> 00:11:11.920 align:start position:0%
you're all in your correct seats
 
00:11:13.990 --> 00:11:14.000 align:start position:0%
the first thing you do is you push your
 
00:11:15.910 --> 00:11:15.920 align:start position:0%
white button and you turn your voting
 
00:11:17.350 --> 00:11:17.360 align:start position:0%
stations on
 
00:11:20.470 --> 00:11:20.480 align:start position:0%
and what you can't see is that
 
00:11:22.069 --> 00:11:22.079 align:start position:0%
from from our
 
00:11:22.079 --> 00:11:23.350 align:start position:0%
from from our
standpoint

00:11:23.350 --> 00:11:23.360 align:start position:0%
standpoint
 
00:11:25.350 --> 00:11:25.360 align:start position:0%
your seats that are black when they're
 
00:11:27.509 --> 00:11:27.519 align:start position:0%
off are turning on to a yellow color so
 
00:11:29.190 --> 00:11:29.200 align:start position:0%
that we know you're here
 
00:11:31.030 --> 00:11:31.040 align:start position:0%
now this helps us
 
00:11:33.910 --> 00:11:33.920 align:start position:0%
and and we can determine um especially
 
00:11:36.470 --> 00:11:36.480 align:start position:0%
during voting if you're not in your seat
 
00:11:39.030 --> 00:11:39.040 align:start position:0%
i look down and i know and then i look
 
00:11:40.870 --> 00:11:40.880 align:start position:0%
over to you and see you're not there so
 
00:11:42.470 --> 00:11:42.480 align:start position:0%
i'm not going to call on you when the
 
00:11:44.949 --> 00:11:44.959 align:start position:0%
voi when the vote ends this is a lot
 
00:11:47.430 --> 00:11:47.440 align:start position:0%
different than the clicker system we've
 
00:11:48.949 --> 00:11:48.959 align:start position:0%
been using because
 
00:11:51.350 --> 00:11:51.360 align:start position:0%
i don't know where you were seated in
 
00:11:54.310 --> 00:11:54.320 align:start position:0%
those ginormous places so i kind of had
 
00:11:56.629 --> 00:11:56.639 align:start position:0%
to go by the alphabetical list this is a
 
00:11:59.350 --> 00:11:59.360 align:start position:0%
seating chart with your actual seat
 
00:12:02.069 --> 00:12:02.079 align:start position:0%
assigned and those things so
 
00:12:04.710 --> 00:12:04.720 align:start position:0%
this is uh this is helpful for a myriad
 
00:12:08.870 --> 00:12:08.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:11.670 --> 00:12:11.680 align:start position:0%
when we begin the session day
 
00:12:13.509 --> 00:12:13.519 align:start position:0%
uh the speaker
 
00:12:15.750 --> 00:12:15.760 align:start position:0%
usually starts by banging the gavel and
 
00:12:18.150 --> 00:12:18.160 align:start position:0%
saying members please take your seat the
 
00:12:19.990 --> 00:12:20.000 align:start position:0%
sergeant-at-arms will encourage members
 
00:12:22.870 --> 00:12:22.880 align:start position:0%
to take their seats and we begin from
 
00:12:25.110 --> 00:12:25.120 align:start position:0%
there the
 
00:12:28.069 --> 00:12:28.079 align:start position:0%
the thing to remember is that once we
 
00:12:31.430 --> 00:12:31.440 align:start position:0%
start going in terms of uh our official
 
00:12:33.350 --> 00:12:33.360 align:start position:0%
opening with the prayer pledge and
 
00:12:36.069 --> 00:12:36.079 align:start position:0%
anthem the doors are closed and the
 
00:12:39.590 --> 00:12:39.600 align:start position:0%
sergeants stayed
 
00:12:42.710 --> 00:12:42.720 align:start position:0%
at the doors and you don't leave or come
 
00:12:44.870 --> 00:12:44.880 align:start position:0%
in during that time because it is it's
 
00:12:47.670 --> 00:12:47.680 align:start position:0%
sort of a quiet time in the chamber
 
00:12:50.470 --> 00:12:50.480 align:start position:0%
after we go through those three things
 
00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:51.269 align:start position:0%
after we go through those three things
then

00:12:51.269 --> 00:12:51.279 align:start position:0%
then
 
00:12:53.430 --> 00:12:53.440 align:start position:0%
members can come in
 
00:12:55.430 --> 00:12:55.440 align:start position:0%
and go as they please
 
00:12:57.829 --> 00:12:57.839 align:start position:0%
so that is just a a point for for
 
00:12:57.839 --> 00:12:59.269 align:start position:0%
so that is just a a point for for
clarification

00:12:59.269 --> 00:12:59.279 align:start position:0%
clarification
 
00:12:59.279 --> 00:13:00.870 align:start position:0%
clarification
um

00:13:00.870 --> 00:13:00.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:03.430 --> 00:13:03.440 align:start position:0%
any questions on those things so far
 
00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:06.710 align:start position:0%
any questions on those things so far
good

00:13:06.710 --> 00:13:06.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:07.990 align:start position:0%
 
this

00:13:07.990 --> 00:13:08.000 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:13:10.790 --> 00:13:10.800 align:start position:0%
is a very big gavel
 
00:13:14.790 --> 00:13:14.800 align:start position:0%
and when it gets swung down especially
 
00:13:17.430 --> 00:13:17.440 align:start position:0%
when the speaker is banging it that
 
00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:19.990 align:start position:0%
when the speaker is banging it that
means

00:13:19.990 --> 00:13:20.000 align:start position:0%
means
 
00:13:22.629 --> 00:13:22.639 align:start position:0%
it means that uh the speaker is bringing
 
00:13:24.710 --> 00:13:24.720 align:start position:0%
the room to order and by bringing the
 
00:13:26.470 --> 00:13:26.480 align:start position:0%
room to order that means all of you need
 
00:13:28.629 --> 00:13:28.639 align:start position:0%
to come to order
 
00:13:31.350 --> 00:13:31.360 align:start position:0%
when the speaker bangs the gavel because
 
00:13:33.590 --> 00:13:33.600 align:start position:0%
it's noisy in here
 
00:13:36.790 --> 00:13:36.800 align:start position:0%
as we've we've seen numerous times at
 
00:13:38.949 --> 00:13:38.959 align:start position:0%
our off-site sessions it's because it's
 
00:13:41.110 --> 00:13:41.120 align:start position:0%
too noisy and the members who are
 
00:13:43.030 --> 00:13:43.040 align:start position:0%
speaking at these two
 
00:13:44.389 --> 00:13:44.399 align:start position:0%
parts of the well
 
00:13:47.269 --> 00:13:47.279 align:start position:0%
are entitled to do so and and we all owe
 
00:13:49.269 --> 00:13:49.279 align:start position:0%
our attention to them
 
00:13:51.110 --> 00:13:51.120 align:start position:0%
um if
 
00:13:53.110 --> 00:13:53.120 align:start position:0%
and again this is a smaller room if
 
00:13:54.949 --> 00:13:54.959 align:start position:0%
you're sitting up in the corner or
 
00:13:56.790 --> 00:13:56.800 align:start position:0%
you're standing in the back
 
00:13:59.430 --> 00:13:59.440 align:start position:0%
the acoustics in this room are such that
 
00:14:01.990 --> 00:14:02.000 align:start position:0%
everything comes right back down to here
 
00:14:03.910 --> 00:14:03.920 align:start position:0%
so the speaker hears it
 
00:14:05.750 --> 00:14:05.760 align:start position:0%
and it and
 
00:14:08.870 --> 00:14:08.880 align:start position:0%
every speaker i've ever worked for uh
 
00:14:11.590 --> 00:14:11.600 align:start position:0%
hears it and and gets angry at the beams
 
00:14:14.230 --> 00:14:14.240 align:start position:0%
so please just remember remember that uh
 
00:14:17.030 --> 00:14:17.040 align:start position:0%
if dartmouth arms comes to you and asks
 
00:14:18.629 --> 00:14:18.639 align:start position:0%
you to take your conversation out in the
 
00:14:20.550 --> 00:14:20.560 align:start position:0%
hallway it's a pretty good idea to do
 
00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:21.829 align:start position:0%
hallway it's a pretty good idea to do
that

00:14:21.829 --> 00:14:21.839 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:14:24.389 --> 00:14:24.399 align:start position:0%
um we do have if you didn't get handouts
 
00:14:25.750 --> 00:14:25.760 align:start position:0%
there are some handouts up front i just
 
00:14:27.509 --> 00:14:27.519 align:start position:0%
want to go over those real quick the
 
00:14:30.629 --> 00:14:30.639 align:start position:0%
first one is an evacuation plan or an
 
00:14:34.629 --> 00:14:34.639 align:start position:0%
emergency exit type situation it has
 
00:14:37.269 --> 00:14:37.279 align:start position:0%
where you're seated in the chamber
 
00:14:39.829 --> 00:14:39.839 align:start position:0%
please exit one of those
 
00:14:42.310 --> 00:14:42.320 align:start position:0%
exit ways if we are going through
 
00:14:44.870 --> 00:14:44.880 align:start position:0%
whether there's a fire emergency or or
 
00:14:46.389 --> 00:14:46.399 align:start position:0%
something along those lines that's
 
00:14:48.150 --> 00:14:48.160 align:start position:0%
that's how we should exit the chamber so
 
00:14:50.310 --> 00:14:50.320 align:start position:0%
please pay attention to that
 
00:14:51.990 --> 00:14:52.000 align:start position:0%
the other form
 
00:14:54.310 --> 00:14:54.320 align:start position:0%
is one of my favorite forms and it says
 
00:14:56.790 --> 00:14:56.800 align:start position:0%
parliamentary inquiry at the top of it
 
00:14:56.800 --> 00:14:57.750 align:start position:0%
parliamentary inquiry at the top of it
and

00:14:57.750 --> 00:14:57.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:15:00.550 --> 00:15:00.560 align:start position:0%
it kind of gives you a brief outline of
 
00:15:02.870 --> 00:15:02.880 align:start position:0%
of a parliamentary inquiry and and how
 
00:15:04.150 --> 00:15:04.160 align:start position:0%
it should be done
 
00:15:07.670 --> 00:15:07.680 align:start position:0%
i would just notice uh as well
 
00:15:10.069 --> 00:15:10.079 align:start position:0%
when we were in our last session day we
 
00:15:12.150 --> 00:15:12.160 align:start position:0%
had several very long parliamentary
 
00:15:13.910 --> 00:15:13.920 align:start position:0%
inquiries and then representative weber
 
00:15:15.189 --> 00:15:15.199 align:start position:0%
gave a
 
00:15:16.790 --> 00:15:16.800 align:start position:0%
one of the best parliamentary inquiries
 
00:15:18.629 --> 00:15:18.639 align:start position:0%
i've heard in a while and and i would
 
00:15:20.230 --> 00:15:20.240 align:start position:0%
just mention i don't even remember what
 
00:15:22.629 --> 00:15:22.639 align:start position:0%
the topic was but it was two sentences
 
00:15:25.189 --> 00:15:25.199 align:start position:0%
it was it was to the point it it said
 
00:15:27.430 --> 00:15:27.440 align:start position:0%
exactly what it needed to be said and
 
00:15:29.829 --> 00:15:29.839 align:start position:0%
she went and sat down and that is a
 
00:15:31.749 --> 00:15:31.759 align:start position:0%
purpose of a parliamentary inquiry it is
 
00:15:31.759 --> 00:15:32.710 align:start position:0%
purpose of a parliamentary inquiry it is
not

00:15:32.710 --> 00:15:32.720 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:15:36.069 --> 00:15:36.079 align:start position:0%
to have a further debate on the bill
 
00:15:38.150 --> 00:15:38.160 align:start position:0%
parliamentary and i and i think back
 
00:15:40.150 --> 00:15:40.160 align:start position:0%
just to 20 years ago when i first got
 
00:15:43.189 --> 00:15:43.199 align:start position:0%
here as a as a kid
 
00:15:43.199 --> 00:15:43.910 align:start position:0%
here as a as a kid
the

00:15:43.910 --> 00:15:43.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:15:47.030 --> 00:15:47.040 align:start position:0%
the parliamentary inquiries were usually
 
00:15:49.590 --> 00:15:49.600 align:start position:0%
done by committee chairs
 
00:15:51.030 --> 00:15:51.040 align:start position:0%
ranking members
 
00:15:53.269 --> 00:15:53.279 align:start position:0%
leadership team folks they would get up
 
00:15:54.629 --> 00:15:54.639 align:start position:0%
they would make their two points and
 
00:15:56.629 --> 00:15:56.639 align:start position:0%
they would sit down and most of the time
 
00:15:58.629 --> 00:15:58.639 align:start position:0%
it was because members who hadn't been
 
00:16:00.550 --> 00:16:00.560 align:start position:0%
in the chamber were coming back in and
 
00:16:02.389 --> 00:16:02.399 align:start position:0%
they were sort of getting their
 
00:16:04.629 --> 00:16:04.639 align:start position:0%
their their information
 
00:16:05.990 --> 00:16:06.000 align:start position:0%
as a quick
 
00:16:06.870 --> 00:16:06.880 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:16:09.749 --> 00:16:09.759 align:start position:0%
memory uh bouncer so uh just a a quick
 
00:16:11.509 --> 00:16:11.519 align:start position:0%
point on parliamentary inquiries because
 
00:16:14.310 --> 00:16:14.320 align:start position:0%
we've we've very we've gone on very long
 
00:16:16.069 --> 00:16:16.079 align:start position:0%
on those things lately and i think we
 
00:16:18.629 --> 00:16:18.639 align:start position:0%
need to to cull it back um the other
 
00:16:20.150 --> 00:16:20.160 align:start position:0%
form i have for you here is called
 
00:16:22.949 --> 00:16:22.959 align:start position:0%
paul's parliamentary points and i'm a
 
00:16:26.470 --> 00:16:26.480 align:start position:0%
fan of alliteration if you couldn't tell
 
00:16:29.030 --> 00:16:29.040 align:start position:0%
these are all points from either house
 
00:16:30.629 --> 00:16:30.639 align:start position:0%
rules from the constitution or for
 
00:16:33.189 --> 00:16:33.199 align:start position:0%
mason's manual and as well as a few
 
00:16:35.590 --> 00:16:35.600 align:start position:0%
points of our own custom usage and
 
00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:36.550 align:start position:0%
points of our own custom usage and
precedent

00:16:36.550 --> 00:16:36.560 align:start position:0%
precedent
 
00:16:36.560 --> 00:16:37.670 align:start position:0%
precedent
and

00:16:37.670 --> 00:16:37.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:16:39.269 --> 00:16:39.279 align:start position:0%
you don't need to look at them now but
 
00:16:40.710 --> 00:16:40.720 align:start position:0%
they're they're just some
 
00:16:43.189 --> 00:16:43.199 align:start position:0%
some of the reminders about how we
 
00:16:45.430 --> 00:16:45.440 align:start position:0%
behave on the floor specifically not
 
00:16:48.230 --> 00:16:48.240 align:start position:0%
referring to people by name
 
00:16:49.110 --> 00:16:49.120 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:16:50.790 --> 00:16:50.800 align:start position:0%
representative notter would not stand up
 
00:16:53.670 --> 00:16:53.680 align:start position:0%
here and say hi lori um because that's
 
00:16:56.230 --> 00:16:56.240 align:start position:0%
that's not appropriate uh apologies
 
00:16:59.189 --> 00:16:59.199 align:start position:0%
representative stanford um so so that th
 
00:17:01.110 --> 00:17:01.120 align:start position:0%
they're just points like that for for
 
00:17:05.350 --> 00:17:05.360 align:start position:0%
your uh edification and also um just for
 
00:17:08.150 --> 00:17:08.160 align:start position:0%
you know we we want to encourage a good
 
00:17:10.870 --> 00:17:10.880 align:start position:0%
decorous behavior on the floor
 
00:17:13.829 --> 00:17:13.839 align:start position:0%
a couple of other points that that we've
 
00:17:15.990 --> 00:17:16.000 align:start position:0%
we've encountered a lot over the past
 
00:17:18.150 --> 00:17:18.160 align:start position:0%
couple of years that that the speaker
 
00:17:19.990 --> 00:17:20.000 align:start position:0%
asked me to sort of cover
 
00:17:22.470 --> 00:17:22.480 align:start position:0%
we do not have a dress code in the new
 
00:17:24.789 --> 00:17:24.799 align:start position:0%
hampshire house of representatives we've
 
00:17:28.630 --> 00:17:28.640 align:start position:0%
not really needed to necessarily
 
00:17:30.390 --> 00:17:30.400 align:start position:0%
everybody i think has a
 
00:17:33.430 --> 00:17:33.440 align:start position:0%
a fairly fundamental understanding of of
 
00:17:35.830 --> 00:17:35.840 align:start position:0%
sort of a business type dress for when
 
00:17:37.750 --> 00:17:37.760 align:start position:0%
you are on the floor especially of the
 
00:17:37.760 --> 00:17:39.029 align:start position:0%
you are on the floor especially of the
house

00:17:39.029 --> 00:17:39.039 align:start position:0%
house
 
00:17:42.230 --> 00:17:42.240 align:start position:0%
but i always like to to say
 
00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:43.990 align:start position:0%
but i always like to to say
please

00:17:43.990 --> 00:17:44.000 align:start position:0%
please
 
00:17:46.789 --> 00:17:46.799 align:start position:0%
dress in a manner that is respectful of
 
00:17:48.950 --> 00:17:48.960 align:start position:0%
the fact that you are sitting in the
 
00:17:52.549 --> 00:17:52.559 align:start position:0%
same room as a member 200 years ago
 
00:17:53.669 --> 00:17:53.679 align:start position:0%
you're sitting
 
00:17:56.150 --> 00:17:56.160 align:start position:0%
as a representative for a legislative
 
00:17:59.270 --> 00:17:59.280 align:start position:0%
body that has existed since the 1680s
 
00:18:01.510 --> 00:18:01.520 align:start position:0%
so so that's why i i that's how i've
 
00:18:03.990 --> 00:18:04.000 align:start position:0%
always encouraged people in in terms of
 
00:18:06.950 --> 00:18:06.960 align:start position:0%
their dress on the floor um so
 
00:18:09.750 --> 00:18:09.760 align:start position:0%
we'll we'll leave it at that um
 
00:18:11.669 --> 00:18:11.679 align:start position:0%
i think i think those are some of the
 
00:18:13.830 --> 00:18:13.840 align:start position:0%
points that that the speaker and i kind
 
00:18:15.750 --> 00:18:15.760 align:start position:0%
of briefly touched on
 
00:18:16.710 --> 00:18:16.720 align:start position:0%
but we
 
00:18:19.669 --> 00:18:19.679 align:start position:0%
we do have a brief um mock session we're
 
00:18:21.909 --> 00:18:21.919 align:start position:0%
going to go through uh but
 
00:18:24.390 --> 00:18:24.400 align:start position:0%
this is also an opportunity uh to talk
 
00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:25.270 align:start position:0%
this is also an opportunity uh to talk
about

00:18:25.270 --> 00:18:25.280 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:18:26.950 --> 00:18:26.960 align:start position:0%
questions that you might have about
 
00:18:29.190 --> 00:18:29.200 align:start position:0%
being in here
 
00:18:31.270 --> 00:18:31.280 align:start position:0%
some some little nitpicky things for
 
00:18:31.280 --> 00:18:32.390 align:start position:0%
some some little nitpicky things for
example

00:18:32.390 --> 00:18:32.400 align:start position:0%
example
 
00:18:35.029 --> 00:18:35.039 align:start position:0%
you can't eat food in here folks
 
00:18:37.190 --> 00:18:37.200 align:start position:0%
this is a no food zone
 
00:18:39.590 --> 00:18:39.600 align:start position:0%
so if you have food
 
00:18:40.950 --> 00:18:40.960 align:start position:0%
you really shouldn't do it in the
 
00:18:43.510 --> 00:18:43.520 align:start position:0%
anterooms but if you have food
 
00:18:44.789 --> 00:18:44.799 align:start position:0%
my good i saw my good friend
 
00:18:47.190 --> 00:18:47.200 align:start position:0%
representative wilhelm over here
 
00:18:48.710 --> 00:18:48.720 align:start position:0%
a couple years ago when representative
 
00:18:50.870 --> 00:18:50.880 align:start position:0%
wilhelm was was a freshman
 
00:18:53.270 --> 00:18:53.280 align:start position:0%
member he he came in with a very large
 
00:18:55.909 --> 00:18:55.919 align:start position:0%
box of cheez-its now he is a young dad
 
00:18:58.870 --> 00:18:58.880 align:start position:0%
like myself and and we we have to have
 
00:19:01.669 --> 00:19:01.679 align:start position:0%
cheez-its in in supply at our homes all
 
00:19:02.710 --> 00:19:02.720 align:start position:0%
the time
 
00:19:05.990 --> 00:19:06.000 align:start position:0%
um so but i reminded him uh when when he
 
00:19:08.310 --> 00:19:08.320 align:start position:0%
posted his picture on twitter that uh he
 
00:19:09.669 --> 00:19:09.679 align:start position:0%
should probably leave those in his
 
00:19:12.230 --> 00:19:12.240 align:start position:0%
mailbox in the back and he he
 
00:19:14.310 --> 00:19:14.320 align:start position:0%
graciously complied
 
00:19:16.710 --> 00:19:16.720 align:start position:0%
so just just little things like that
 
00:19:19.830 --> 00:19:19.840 align:start position:0%
water is is acceptable in this room as a
 
00:19:21.430 --> 00:19:21.440 align:start position:0%
matter of fact in a couple of months
 
00:19:23.270 --> 00:19:23.280 align:start position:0%
when it's pretty warm in here there will
 
00:19:24.950 --> 00:19:24.960 align:start position:0%
be coolers that will be set up in the
 
00:19:24.960 --> 00:19:25.830 align:start position:0%
be coolers that will be set up in the
back

00:19:25.830 --> 00:19:25.840 align:start position:0%
back
 
00:19:27.510 --> 00:19:27.520 align:start position:0%
with multiple bottles of water so that
 
00:19:30.230 --> 00:19:30.240 align:start position:0%
you can remain hydrated because
 
00:19:33.029 --> 00:19:33.039 align:start position:0%
your safety is our concern especially as
 
00:19:34.549 --> 00:19:34.559 align:start position:0%
as many of you recall in our last
 
00:19:35.990 --> 00:19:36.000 align:start position:0%
session day
 
00:19:38.150 --> 00:19:38.160 align:start position:0%
the safety of our members is paramount
 
00:19:41.190 --> 00:19:41.200 align:start position:0%
we do have medical people on site
 
00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:41.990 align:start position:0%
we do have medical people on site
to

00:19:41.990 --> 00:19:42.000 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:19:43.590 --> 00:19:43.600 align:start position:0%
assess situations and deal with
 
00:19:46.230 --> 00:19:46.240 align:start position:0%
situations as needed we have had medical
 
00:19:48.470 --> 00:19:48.480 align:start position:0%
issues in this room in the past
 
00:19:49.669 --> 00:19:49.679 align:start position:0%
but we have
 
00:19:52.630 --> 00:19:52.640 align:start position:0%
not just not just members of staff here
 
00:19:55.430 --> 00:19:55.440 align:start position:0%
but we also have uh we have folks on our
 
00:19:58.230 --> 00:19:58.240 align:start position:0%
sergeant-at-arms staff as well that that
 
00:20:00.870 --> 00:20:00.880 align:start position:0%
our emts and and as well as additional
 
00:20:02.789 --> 00:20:02.799 align:start position:0%
members as well
 
00:20:05.029 --> 00:20:05.039 align:start position:0%
i mean there are many members that are
 
00:20:08.310 --> 00:20:08.320 align:start position:0%
volunteer uh fire fighters and and emts
 
00:20:10.549 --> 00:20:10.559 align:start position:0%
in their own communities and
 
00:20:12.630 --> 00:20:12.640 align:start position:0%
will uh will certainly
 
00:20:17.350 --> 00:20:17.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:21.430 --> 00:20:21.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:22.230 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:20:22.230 --> 00:20:22.240 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:20:34.950 --> 00:20:34.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:37.430 --> 00:20:37.440 align:start position:0%
i said this at our last session
 
00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:38.710 align:start position:0%
i said this at our last session
and

00:20:38.710 --> 00:20:38.720 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:20:42.630 --> 00:20:42.640 align:start position:0%
i'll say it again when we meet next week
 
00:20:44.789 --> 00:20:44.799 align:start position:0%
the decorum
 
00:20:46.549 --> 00:20:46.559 align:start position:0%
in bedford
 
00:20:48.789 --> 00:20:48.799 align:start position:0%
in manchester
 
00:20:48.799 --> 00:20:53.430 align:start position:0%
in manchester
was

00:20:53.430 --> 00:20:53.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:56.470 --> 00:20:56.480 align:start position:0%
probably close to despicable by
 
00:20:58.149 --> 00:20:58.159 align:start position:0%
our members
 
00:20:59.990 --> 00:21:00.000 align:start position:0%
and i'm not picking on one side or the
 
00:21:01.350 --> 00:21:01.360 align:start position:0%
other side
 
00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:02.390 align:start position:0%
other side
the

00:21:02.390 --> 00:21:02.400 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:21:04.710 --> 00:21:04.720 align:start position:0%
amount of noise the amount of
 
00:21:07.190 --> 00:21:07.200 align:start position:0%
conversations that were happening on
 
00:21:10.230 --> 00:21:10.240 align:start position:0%
both sides of the aisle was absolutely
 
00:21:13.669 --> 00:21:13.679 align:start position:0%
100 percent unacceptable
 
00:21:14.950 --> 00:21:14.960 align:start position:0%
i thought it was going to break the
 
00:21:16.789 --> 00:21:16.799 align:start position:0%
podium a couple times when i brought the
 
00:21:18.149 --> 00:21:18.159 align:start position:0%
gavel down
 
00:21:20.390 --> 00:21:20.400 align:start position:0%
but it only lasted for a couple of
 
00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:21.750 align:start position:0%
but it only lasted for a couple of
minutes

00:21:21.750 --> 00:21:21.760 align:start position:0%
minutes
 
00:21:23.909 --> 00:21:23.919 align:start position:0%
let me make it clear that will not be
 
00:21:23.919 --> 00:21:25.270 align:start position:0%
let me make it clear that will not be
tolerated

00:21:25.270 --> 00:21:25.280 align:start position:0%
tolerated
 
00:21:28.710 --> 00:21:28.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:29.750 --> 00:21:29.760 align:start position:0%
i know
 
00:21:31.590 --> 00:21:31.600 align:start position:0%
back when we were over
 
00:21:34.710 --> 00:21:34.720 align:start position:0%
to the unh ring
 
00:21:38.230 --> 00:21:38.240 align:start position:0%
speaker shirtless had the same problem
 
00:21:39.990 --> 00:21:40.000 align:start position:0%
and we've had the same problem now for
 
00:21:42.870 --> 00:21:42.880 align:start position:0%
two years since our last session day
 
00:21:45.190 --> 00:21:45.200 align:start position:0%
when we spent 19 hours in this chamber
 
00:21:47.430 --> 00:21:47.440 align:start position:0%
on march 13th
 
00:21:49.270 --> 00:21:49.280 align:start position:0%
so the
 
00:21:49.280 --> 00:21:50.630 align:start position:0%
so the
decorum

00:21:50.630 --> 00:21:50.640 align:start position:0%
decorum
 
00:21:53.669 --> 00:21:53.679 align:start position:0%
will be enforced
 
00:21:56.390 --> 00:21:56.400 align:start position:0%
and we'll have some other
 
00:21:58.710 --> 00:21:58.720 align:start position:0%
incidences that are going to be
 
00:22:01.029 --> 00:22:01.039 align:start position:0%
perpetrated on purpose
 
00:22:02.950 --> 00:22:02.960 align:start position:0%
to make sure that everybody understands
 
00:22:07.669 --> 00:22:07.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:10.950 --> 00:22:10.960 align:start position:0%
and as far as the debate goes
 
00:22:13.669 --> 00:22:13.679 align:start position:0%
we picked a subject matter
 
00:22:13.679 --> 00:22:15.270 align:start position:0%
we picked a subject matter
that

00:22:15.270 --> 00:22:15.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:22:17.669 --> 00:22:17.679 align:start position:0%
we hope you will get some enjoyment out
 
00:22:18.710 --> 00:22:18.720 align:start position:0%
of it
 
00:22:20.630 --> 00:22:20.640 align:start position:0%
but at the same time
 
00:22:24.789 --> 00:22:24.799 align:start position:0%
realize how a debate should be run
 
00:22:24.799 --> 00:22:25.750 align:start position:0%
realize how a debate should be run
so

00:22:25.750 --> 00:22:25.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:22:27.990 --> 00:22:28.000 align:start position:0%
with that i mean we're going to go right
 
00:22:32.870 --> 00:22:32.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:37.590 --> 00:22:37.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:39.430 --> 00:22:39.440 align:start position:0%

00:27:32.630 --> 00:27:32.640 align:start position:0%
the member from charlestown is
 
00:27:35.669 --> 00:27:35.679 align:start position:0%
represented is is recognized to speak
 
00:27:41.909 --> 00:27:41.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:44.789 --> 00:27:44.799 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker i mean first of all
 
00:27:47.110 --> 00:27:47.120 align:start position:0%
this bill was only filed because of the
 
00:27:49.110 --> 00:27:49.120 align:start position:0%
washington dc oreo lobby and the
 
00:27:52.070 --> 00:27:52.080 align:start position:0%
sponsors deep ties and addiction to
 
00:27:56.310 --> 00:27:56.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:58.230 --> 00:27:58.240 align:start position:0%
you're out of
 
00:28:00.549 --> 00:28:00.559 align:start position:0%
you're out of order please confine
 
00:28:04.149 --> 00:28:04.159 align:start position:0%
yourself to the subject matter
 
00:28:10.549 --> 00:28:10.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:12.230 --> 00:28:12.240 align:start position:0%
second mistake
 
00:28:14.389 --> 00:28:14.399 align:start position:0%
you do not refer
 
00:28:18.310 --> 00:28:18.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:20.470 --> 00:28:20.480 align:start position:0%
now you may continue thank you mr
 
00:28:22.950 --> 00:28:22.960 align:start position:0%
speaker i apologize to the speaker of
 
00:28:25.269 --> 00:28:25.279 align:start position:0%
the house and my good friend from epsom
 
00:28:27.190 --> 00:28:27.200 align:start position:0%
for my lapse in judgment and it will not
 
00:28:29.110 --> 00:28:29.120 align:start position:0%
happen again
 
00:28:32.789 --> 00:28:32.799 align:start position:0%
so study study why would you study have
 
00:28:34.149 --> 00:28:34.159 align:start position:0%
you even tried these things they're
 
00:28:38.470 --> 00:28:38.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:41.430 --> 00:28:41.440 align:start position:0%
the member will suspend the member knows
 
00:28:45.110 --> 00:28:45.120 align:start position:0%
that we do not use props of any form in
 
00:28:47.590 --> 00:28:47.600 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire house
 
00:28:53.190 --> 00:28:53.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:56.070 --> 00:28:56.080 align:start position:0%
at any rate study so
 
00:28:57.269 --> 00:28:57.279 align:start position:0%
what will happen when we create the
 
00:28:58.549 --> 00:28:58.559 align:start position:0%
study commission you'll have a
 
00:29:00.070 --> 00:29:00.080 align:start position:0%
commission they'll meet right we'll
 
00:29:02.070 --> 00:29:02.080 align:start position:0%
probably live stream it what does that
 
00:29:04.389 --> 00:29:04.399 align:start position:0%
mean commissions on tv what are they
 
00:29:07.029 --> 00:29:07.039 align:start position:0%
talking about oreo cookies i'm against
 
00:29:08.950 --> 00:29:08.960 align:start position:0%
corporate welfare there's no way we're
 
00:29:10.710 --> 00:29:10.720 align:start position:0%
going to have state-sponsored oreo
 
00:29:12.470 --> 00:29:12.480 align:start position:0%
commercials so
 
00:29:13.430 --> 00:29:13.440 align:start position:0%
for me
 
00:29:15.510 --> 00:29:15.520 align:start position:0%
for you and for the girl scouts please
 
00:29:24.389 --> 00:29:24.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:28.549 --> 00:29:28.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:28.559 --> 00:29:29.830 align:start position:0%
 
another

00:29:29.830 --> 00:29:29.840 align:start position:0%
another
 
00:29:29.840 --> 00:29:31.990 align:start position:0%
another
point

00:29:31.990 --> 00:29:32.000 align:start position:0%
point
 
00:29:34.389 --> 00:29:34.399 align:start position:0%
that got out a little bit out of hand
 
00:29:36.070 --> 00:29:36.080 align:start position:0%
while we're off site
 
00:29:38.389 --> 00:29:38.399 align:start position:0%
is the house does not show emotion one
 
00:29:41.510 --> 00:29:41.520 align:start position:0%
way or the other on any subject matter
 
00:29:45.350 --> 00:29:45.360 align:start position:0%
no booing no yaying no clapping
 
00:29:47.510 --> 00:29:47.520 align:start position:0%
no boo no no no
 
00:29:50.149 --> 00:29:50.159 align:start position:0%
showing of emotion of any kind
 
00:29:51.990 --> 00:29:52.000 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes
 
00:29:53.990 --> 00:29:54.000 align:start position:0%
the member from epsom representative
 
00:29:55.750 --> 00:29:55.760 align:start position:0%
mcguire to speak in favor of the
 
00:30:05.190 --> 00:30:05.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:08.310 --> 00:30:08.320 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
00:30:09.750 --> 00:30:09.760 align:start position:0%
as you know
 
00:30:11.830 --> 00:30:11.840 align:start position:0%
my committee has never been in favor of
 
00:30:14.230 --> 00:30:14.240 align:start position:0%
unnecessary study committees they're a
 
00:30:17.590 --> 00:30:17.600 align:start position:0%
waste of our time however in this case
 
00:30:20.149 --> 00:30:20.159 align:start position:0%
the bipartisan majority of the committee
 
00:30:21.909 --> 00:30:21.919 align:start position:0%
agreed that this was a topic they could
 
00:30:24.310 --> 00:30:24.320 align:start position:0%
really sink their teeth into
 
00:30:27.990 --> 00:30:28.000 align:start position:0%
we all agreed that this deserved study
 
00:30:30.950 --> 00:30:30.960 align:start position:0%
not just on the techniques
 
00:30:33.110 --> 00:30:33.120 align:start position:0%
but also on the important issue of
 
00:30:33.120 --> 00:30:34.549 align:start position:0%
but also on the important issue of
dunking

00:30:34.549 --> 00:30:34.559 align:start position:0%
dunking
 
00:30:37.510 --> 00:30:37.520 align:start position:0%
because as you know the classic dunk is
 
00:30:37.520 --> 00:30:38.549 align:start position:0%
because as you know the classic dunk is
milk

00:30:38.549 --> 00:30:38.559 align:start position:0%
milk
 
00:30:41.630 --> 00:30:41.640 align:start position:0%
but that tends to be
 
00:30:44.389 --> 00:30:44.399 align:start position:0%
discriminatory to our lactose intolerant
 
00:30:47.510 --> 00:30:47.520 align:start position:0%
constituents and therefore we needed to
 
00:30:50.070 --> 00:30:50.080 align:start position:0%
consider other options
 
00:30:51.990 --> 00:30:52.000 align:start position:0%
red wine of course
 
00:30:53.430 --> 00:30:53.440 align:start position:0%
but you know
 
00:30:56.310 --> 00:30:56.320 align:start position:0%
do you use merlot
 
00:30:59.990 --> 00:31:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:02.389 --> 00:31:02.399 align:start position:0%
i've heard that heard rumors of white
 
00:31:03.990 --> 00:31:04.000 align:start position:0%
wine but that's just not the new
 
00:31:06.470 --> 00:31:06.480 align:start position:0%
hampshire way
 
00:31:06.480 --> 00:31:07.350 align:start position:0%
hampshire way
so

00:31:07.350 --> 00:31:07.360 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:31:08.950 --> 00:31:08.960 align:start position:0%
we have
 
00:31:11.669 --> 00:31:11.679 align:start position:0%
all these questions and the reason for a
 
00:31:13.990 --> 00:31:14.000 align:start position:0%
commission rather than just studying it
 
00:31:16.149 --> 00:31:16.159 align:start position:0%
in our own committee is that we need
 
00:31:18.710 --> 00:31:18.720 align:start position:0%
people from other committees who have
 
00:31:20.870 --> 00:31:20.880 align:start position:0%
knowledge that we don't we need people
 
00:31:23.110 --> 00:31:23.120 align:start position:0%
from commerce we need people from
 
00:31:25.269 --> 00:31:25.279 align:start position:0%
environment and agriculture
 
00:31:28.470 --> 00:31:28.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:31.590 --> 00:31:31.600 align:start position:0%
division of agriculture markets and food
 
00:31:34.549 --> 00:31:34.559 align:start position:0%
and there are allegations that oreos are
 
00:31:36.310 --> 00:31:36.320 align:start position:0%
in fact food
 
00:31:38.389 --> 00:31:38.399 align:start position:0%
we also need to have people from the
 
00:31:40.470 --> 00:31:40.480 align:start position:0%
committee on legislative administration
 
00:31:44.070 --> 00:31:44.080 align:start position:0%
to deal with other allegations
 
00:31:44.080 --> 00:31:47.430 align:start position:0%
to deal with other allegations
of

00:31:47.430 --> 00:31:47.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:47.440 --> 00:31:48.549 align:start position:0%
 
un

00:31:48.549 --> 00:31:48.559 align:start position:0%
un
 
00:31:51.350 --> 00:31:51.360 align:start position:0%
undue influence due to court campaign
 
00:31:53.750 --> 00:31:53.760 align:start position:0%
contributions from big cookie
 
00:31:55.990 --> 00:31:56.000 align:start position:0%
that's an important issue throughout new
 
00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:57.110 align:start position:0%
that's an important issue throughout new
hampshire

00:31:57.110 --> 00:31:57.120 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
00:31:59.750 --> 00:31:59.760 align:start position:0%
and in order for fair and honest
 
00:32:01.669 --> 00:32:01.679 align:start position:0%
elections we need to
 
00:32:03.909 --> 00:32:03.919 align:start position:0%
study the issue and settle it once and
 
00:32:04.789 --> 00:32:04.799 align:start position:0%
for all
 
00:32:09.590 --> 00:32:09.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:14.310 --> 00:32:14.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:17.110 --> 00:32:17.120 align:start position:0%
does a member yield the questions
 
00:32:17.120 --> 00:32:18.310 align:start position:0%
does a member yield the questions
yes

00:32:18.310 --> 00:32:18.320 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:32:23.830 --> 00:32:23.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:26.789 --> 00:32:26.799 align:start position:0%
just just before you point your point
 
00:32:28.789 --> 00:32:28.799 align:start position:0%
just so everybody knows especially for
 
00:32:32.149 --> 00:32:32.159 align:start position:0%

the uh complex
 
00:32:43.509 --> 00:32:43.519 align:start position:0%
if you're going to ask a question
 
00:32:46.389 --> 00:32:46.399 align:start position:0%
in the chamber you must come down
 
00:32:48.630 --> 00:32:48.640 align:start position:0%
to the podium and ask the question
 
00:32:52.470 --> 00:32:52.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:54.310 --> 00:32:54.320 align:start position:0%

recognizes

00:34:06.950 --> 00:34:06.960 align:start position:0%
recognizes
 
00:34:08.790 --> 00:34:08.800 align:start position:0%
the member from charleston
 
00:34:12.950 --> 00:34:12.960 align:start position:0%
for a parliamentary inquiry
 
00:34:15.270 --> 00:34:15.280 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker
 
00:34:17.430 --> 00:34:17.440 align:start position:0%
if you know as i know that this bill
 
00:34:20.069 --> 00:34:20.079 align:start position:0%
creates a commission to study something
 
00:34:23.109 --> 00:34:23.119 align:start position:0%
that we know doesn't need to be studied
 
00:34:25.270 --> 00:34:25.280 align:start position:0%
because everybody already loves oreo
 
00:34:25.280 --> 00:34:26.389 align:start position:0%
because everybody already loves oreo
cookies

00:34:26.389 --> 00:34:26.399 align:start position:0%
cookies
 
00:34:30.069 --> 00:34:30.079 align:start position:0%
especially the double stuffed ones
 
00:34:32.310 --> 00:34:32.320 align:start position:0%
and since i know that it doesn't matter
 
00:34:33.990 --> 00:34:34.000 align:start position:0%
what's in the cream filling because it
 
00:34:35.750 --> 00:34:35.760 align:start position:0%
tastes great and because study
 
00:34:37.990 --> 00:34:38.000 align:start position:0%
commissions are a waste of time and we
 
00:34:39.750 --> 00:34:39.760 align:start position:0%
have so many of them bogging down our
 
00:34:41.349 --> 00:34:41.359 align:start position:0%
process and we all know they're a joke
 
00:34:41.359 --> 00:34:44.710 align:start position:0%
process and we all know they're a joke
anyway

00:34:44.710 --> 00:34:44.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:52.790 --> 00:34:52.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:55.750 --> 00:34:55.760 align:start position:0%
mr speaker this is not a parliamentary
 
00:34:57.829 --> 00:34:57.839 align:start position:0%
inquiry the member is making a speech
 
00:34:59.430 --> 00:34:59.440 align:start position:0%
and is referring to things which should
 
00:35:01.270 --> 00:35:01.280 align:start position:0%
not be referred to on the floor of the
 
00:35:01.280 --> 00:35:03.829 align:start position:0%
not be referred to on the floor of the
house

00:35:03.829 --> 00:35:03.839 align:start position:0%
house
 
00:35:05.829 --> 00:35:05.839 align:start position:0%
the member is correct
 
00:35:07.670 --> 00:35:07.680 align:start position:0%
the member will do a proper
 
00:35:10.069 --> 00:35:10.079 align:start position:0%

00:42:35.829 --> 00:42:35.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:38.390 --> 00:42:38.400 align:start position:0%
just to clarify so if you don't vote in
 
00:42:40.470 --> 00:42:40.480 align:start position:0%
that 30 seconds i'm going to call your
 
00:42:40.480 --> 00:42:41.270 align:start position:0%
that 30 seconds i'm going to call your

00:42:43.349 --> 00:42:43.359 align:start position:0%
and you have to give me a thumbs up or
 
00:42:45.510 --> 00:42:45.520 align:start position:0%
thumbs down because we're i'm going to
 
00:42:47.750 --> 00:42:47.760 align:start position:0%
cast a vote for you if you are in the
 
00:42:50.230 --> 00:42:50.240 align:start position:0%
chamber you have to vote
 
00:42:52.150 --> 00:42:52.160 align:start position:0%
we don't abstain in the new hampshire
 
00:42:52.160 --> 00:42:53.030 align:start position:0%
we don't abstain in the new hampshire
house

00:42:53.030 --> 00:42:53.040 align:start position:0%
house
 
00:42:53.040 --> 00:42:58.309 align:start position:0%
house
okay

00:42:58.309 --> 00:42:58.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:00.470 --> 00:43:00.480 align:start position:0%
i'm voting for you i voted on your
 
00:43:02.069 --> 00:43:02.079 align:start position:0%
behalf because you didn't push your
 
00:43:02.079 --> 00:43:04.230 align:start position:0%
behalf because you didn't push your
button

00:43:04.230 --> 00:43:04.240 align:start position:0%
button
 
00:43:05.910 --> 00:43:05.920 align:start position:0%
that's why i need the thumbs up or the
 
00:43:07.430 --> 00:43:07.440 align:start position:0%
thumbs down
 
00:43:16.390 --> 00:43:16.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:17.829 --> 00:43:17.839 align:start position:0%
so the question is if you're in the
 
00:43:19.670 --> 00:43:19.680 align:start position:0%
middle of the 30 seconds can you change
 
00:43:21.829 --> 00:43:21.839 align:start position:0%
your mind and switch by all means if you
 
00:43:23.910 --> 00:43:23.920 align:start position:0%
can you can play if you want to and
 
00:43:26.470 --> 00:43:26.480 align:start position:0%
shoot you know go back and forth i would
 
00:43:28.230 --> 00:43:28.240 align:start position:0%
just be mindful at the end of that 30
 
00:43:29.990 --> 00:43:30.000 align:start position:0%
seconds whatever
 
00:43:33.030 --> 00:43:33.040 align:start position:0%
is is recorded as recorded
 
00:43:34.710 --> 00:43:34.720 align:start position:0%
we have had members who have tried to
 
00:43:36.470 --> 00:43:36.480 align:start position:0%
play beat the clock and wait until the
 
00:43:38.870 --> 00:43:38.880 align:start position:0%
very last second and the buzzer gets
 
00:43:41.510 --> 00:43:41.520 align:start position:0%
them and they didn't vote and so then i
 
00:43:47.270 --> 00:43:47.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:59.829 --> 00:43:59.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:59.839 --> 00:44:00.870 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:44:00.870 --> 00:44:00.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:44:02.630 --> 00:44:02.640 align:start position:0%
representative stapleton asked if he
 
00:44:04.950 --> 00:44:04.960 align:start position:0%
pushed the wrong button
 
00:44:07.430 --> 00:44:07.440 align:start position:0%
and the bell goes off and the speaker
 
00:44:09.349 --> 00:44:09.359 align:start position:0%
before the speaker has stated the voter
 
00:44:13.349 --> 00:44:13.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:15.430 --> 00:44:15.440 align:start position:0%
if if if you
 
00:44:17.910 --> 00:44:17.920 align:start position:0%
uh if the speaker has not announced the
 
00:44:20.230 --> 00:44:20.240 align:start position:0%
vote so if i'm checking with other
 
00:44:20.240 --> 00:44:21.430 align:start position:0%
vote so if i'm checking with other
people

00:44:21.430 --> 00:44:21.440 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:44:25.030 --> 00:44:25.040 align:start position:0%
and because i see that that
 
00:44:26.870 --> 00:44:26.880 align:start position:0%
okay i see a couple yellows on so that
 
00:44:29.190 --> 00:44:29.200 align:start position:0%
means i'm looking around to see if if
 
00:44:29.200 --> 00:44:31.030 align:start position:0%
means i'm looking around to see if if
they're

00:44:31.030 --> 00:44:31.040 align:start position:0%
they're
 
00:44:34.470 --> 00:44:34.480 align:start position:0%
if they voted or not if you
 
00:44:37.910 --> 00:44:37.920 align:start position:0%
need to get my attention and that brief
 
00:44:40.470 --> 00:44:40.480 align:start position:0%
this is a very brief period so before
 
00:44:42.150 --> 00:44:42.160 align:start position:0%
the speaker states the vote if you come
 
00:44:43.910 --> 00:44:43.920 align:start position:0%
up very quickly
 
00:44:45.030 --> 00:44:45.040 align:start position:0%
you shouldn't even leave your seat
 
00:44:46.069 --> 00:44:46.079 align:start position:0%
you're not supposed to leave your seat
 
00:44:48.390 --> 00:44:48.400 align:start position:0%
until the speaker states the vote um so
 
00:44:50.950 --> 00:44:50.960 align:start position:0%
if you get my attention or whatever i
 
00:44:53.270 --> 00:44:53.280 align:start position:0%
will change it but that that really
 
00:44:55.670 --> 00:44:55.680 align:start position:0%
should not happen uh because once that
 
00:44:58.150 --> 00:44:58.160 align:start position:0%
bell rings and you've you've voted that
 
00:44:58.160 --> 00:44:58.950 align:start position:0%
bell rings and you've you've voted that
that's

00:44:58.950 --> 00:44:58.960 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:45:01.510 --> 00:45:01.520 align:start position:0%
it's hard to unring bells
 
00:45:03.510 --> 00:45:03.520 align:start position:0%
in terms of divisions
 
00:45:05.430 --> 00:45:05.440 align:start position:0%
i would just be mindful that divisions
 
00:45:08.230 --> 00:45:08.240 align:start position:0%
are not recorded the number is reported
 
00:45:10.630 --> 00:45:10.640 align:start position:0%
but the the role the the vote is not
 
00:45:13.270 --> 00:45:13.280 align:start position:0%
recorded so
 
00:45:15.829 --> 00:45:15.839 align:start position:0%
you could ask for reconsideration if you
 
00:45:17.829 --> 00:45:17.839 align:start position:0%
were on the prevailing side if you
 
00:45:19.430 --> 00:45:19.440 align:start position:0%
needed to
 
00:45:21.510 --> 00:45:21.520 align:start position:0%
if you
 
00:45:23.430 --> 00:45:23.440 align:start position:0%
were not then you cannot move
 
00:45:23.440 --> 00:45:32.470 align:start position:0%
were not then you cannot move
reconsideration

00:45:32.470 --> 00:45:32.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:36.470 --> 00:45:36.480 align:start position:0%
i really don't advise that um i really
 
00:45:39.349 --> 00:45:39.359 align:start position:0%
the onus i i i don't mean to be rude but
 
00:45:41.990 --> 00:45:42.000 align:start position:0%
the onus is on you to to know how you're
 
00:45:43.829 --> 00:45:43.839 align:start position:0%
voting um
 
00:45:46.550 --> 00:45:46.560 align:start position:0%
you know once you you've when that bell
 
00:45:50.230 --> 00:45:50.240 align:start position:0%
has rung i mean you really should
 
00:45:51.510 --> 00:45:51.520 align:start position:0%
that should be it
 
00:45:54.710 --> 00:45:54.720 align:start position:0%
um if not there is a mechanism for you
 
00:45:57.510 --> 00:45:57.520 align:start position:0%
to note in the cl in the in the journal
 
00:45:59.670 --> 00:45:59.680 align:start position:0%
that you voted incorrectly and you wish
 
00:46:01.829 --> 00:46:01.839 align:start position:0%
to be recorded as having voted the other
 
00:46:01.839 --> 00:46:02.630 align:start position:0%
to be recorded as having voted the other
way

00:46:02.630 --> 00:46:02.640 align:start position:0%
way
 
00:46:04.630 --> 00:46:04.640 align:start position:0%
that is a mechanism
 
00:46:06.710 --> 00:46:06.720 align:start position:0%
that we put in the journal as a courtesy
 
00:46:08.309 --> 00:46:08.319 align:start position:0%
to to members
 
00:46:09.510 --> 00:46:09.520 align:start position:0%
so even if
 
00:46:11.430 --> 00:46:11.440 align:start position:0%
even if for example
 
00:46:13.349 --> 00:46:13.359 align:start position:0%
you had an emergency and needed to step
 
00:46:15.750 --> 00:46:15.760 align:start position:0%
out in the hallway to take a phone call
 
00:46:17.990 --> 00:46:18.000 align:start position:0%
and you did not vote but
 
00:46:20.150 --> 00:46:20.160 align:start position:0%
you wish if you had you would have voted
 
00:46:22.630 --> 00:46:22.640 align:start position:0%
this way i have a green sheet teresa
 
00:46:25.190 --> 00:46:25.200 align:start position:0%
down here our journal clerk
 
00:46:27.270 --> 00:46:27.280 align:start position:0%
the best journal clerk
 
00:46:28.710 --> 00:46:28.720 align:start position:0%
if if you
 
00:46:30.870 --> 00:46:30.880 align:start position:0%
she's got this little green slip and it
 
00:46:33.589 --> 00:46:33.599 align:start position:0%
says that you either voted or you didn't
 
00:46:35.829 --> 00:46:35.839 align:start position:0%
vote and you voted this way but you
 
00:46:37.829 --> 00:46:37.839 align:start position:0%
meant to vote this way
 
00:46:39.990 --> 00:46:40.000 align:start position:0%
and we'll put that in the journal
 
00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:41.030 align:start position:0%
and we'll put that in the journal
so

00:46:41.030 --> 00:46:41.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:46:43.030 --> 00:46:43.040 align:start position:0%
if if one of your constituents gets mad
 
00:46:44.870 --> 00:46:44.880 align:start position:0%
at you you can call them up and just say
 
00:46:47.270 --> 00:46:47.280 align:start position:0%
no no i meant to do this i was talking
 
00:46:54.150 --> 00:46:54.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:56.470 --> 00:46:56.480 align:start position:0%
one other point
 
00:46:58.470 --> 00:46:58.480 align:start position:0%
we saw a lot of
 
00:47:00.309 --> 00:47:00.319 align:start position:0%
moving around
 
00:47:01.589 --> 00:47:01.599 align:start position:0%
in the
 
00:47:04.390 --> 00:47:04.400 align:start position:0%
outside venues that we are at
 
00:47:07.510 --> 00:47:07.520 align:start position:0%
people walking around and in that nature
 
00:47:09.670 --> 00:47:09.680 align:start position:0%
when we're in this chamber
 
00:47:13.030 --> 00:47:13.040 align:start position:0%
you will remain in your seats until
 
00:47:17.109 --> 00:47:17.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:20.309 --> 00:47:20.319 align:start position:0%
and once i call the vote then you could
 
00:47:23.510 --> 00:47:23.520 align:start position:0%
get up but everybody should remain
 
00:47:26.309 --> 00:47:26.319 align:start position:0%
in their seats it isn't a
 
00:47:27.990 --> 00:47:28.000 align:start position:0%
time to get up and start walking around
 
00:47:30.950 --> 00:47:30.960 align:start position:0%
and talking until after the
 
00:47:40.150 --> 00:47:40.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:40.160 --> 00:47:41.190 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:47:41.190 --> 00:47:41.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:43.670 --> 00:47:43.680 align:start position:0%
yeah forgot this part have all members
 
00:47:45.510 --> 00:47:45.520 align:start position:0%
in the chamber voted that were that were
 
00:47:47.589 --> 00:47:47.599 align:start position:0%
eligible to vote
 
00:47:49.190 --> 00:47:49.200 align:start position:0%
the house will attend to the state of
 
00:47:57.270 --> 00:47:57.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:23.589 --> 00:48:23.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:26.390 --> 00:48:26.400 align:start position:0%
the member does not walk in front
 
00:48:30.870 --> 00:48:30.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:33.670 --> 00:48:33.680 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry mr speaker
 
00:48:35.750 --> 00:48:35.760 align:start position:0%
may i be
 
00:48:40.549 --> 00:48:40.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:40.559 --> 00:48:42.309 align:start position:0%
 
yes

00:48:42.309 --> 00:48:42.319 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:48:44.549 --> 00:48:44.559 align:start position:0%
i'd like to apologize to the house for
 
00:48:47.430 --> 00:48:47.440 align:start position:0%
breaking the decorum my old seat last
 
00:48:51.670 --> 00:48:51.680 align:start position:0%
term was 4-4 i was 4x4 then and i left a
 
00:48:53.349 --> 00:48:53.359 align:start position:0%
pack of gum in my seat and i just
 
00:48:55.510 --> 00:48:55.520 align:start position:0%
wondered if it was still there so i
 
00:48:57.750 --> 00:48:57.760 align:start position:0%
apologize to the speaker and to the
 
00:48:57.760 --> 00:49:04.549 align:start position:0%
apologize to the speaker and to the
house

00:49:04.549 --> 00:49:04.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:06.549 --> 00:49:06.559 align:start position:0%
that is one
 
00:49:08.549 --> 00:49:08.559 align:start position:0%
one of the
 
00:49:12.150 --> 00:49:12.160 align:start position:0%
instances that does happen occasionally
 
00:49:13.990 --> 00:49:14.000 align:start position:0%
where somebody will walk in front of the
 
00:49:17.349 --> 00:49:17.359 align:start position:0%
podium and in many cases it's a freshman
 
00:49:20.309 --> 00:49:20.319 align:start position:0%
and that is an absolute no-no
 
00:49:24.870 --> 00:49:24.880 align:start position:0%
so for all you freshmen that um
 
00:49:26.710 --> 00:49:26.720 align:start position:0%
things were a little bit
 
00:49:30.390 --> 00:49:30.400 align:start position:0%
convoluted in our other locations uh
 
00:49:32.069 --> 00:49:32.079 align:start position:0%
where you had to come up to have your
 
00:49:34.230 --> 00:49:34.240 align:start position:0%
clicker checked or something like that
 
00:49:36.150 --> 00:49:36.160 align:start position:0%
uh that doesn't happen in the chamber
 
00:49:38.069 --> 00:49:38.079 align:start position:0%
you do not walk in front of the uh
 
00:49:40.950 --> 00:49:40.960 align:start position:0%
podium here you go up and around if you
 
00:49:45.589 --> 00:49:45.599 align:start position:0%
have to come down or vice versa
 
00:49:48.230 --> 00:49:48.240 align:start position:0%
there's no debate on this one
 
00:49:51.030 --> 00:49:51.040 align:start position:0%
so i'm just going to read through it as
 
00:49:53.270 --> 00:49:53.280 align:start position:0%
if so you'll know what a voice regular
 
00:49:55.109 --> 00:49:55.119 align:start position:0%
voice vote is
 
00:49:57.190 --> 00:49:57.200 align:start position:0%
committee on fight
 
00:49:59.349 --> 00:49:59.359 align:start position:0%
finance to which was referred house bill
 
00:50:02.230 --> 00:50:02.240 align:start position:0%
99 fnal
 
00:50:04.630 --> 00:50:04.640 align:start position:0%
in heck making appropriations to the
 
00:50:06.870 --> 00:50:06.880 align:start position:0%
department of food and agriculture to
 
00:50:09.109 --> 00:50:09.119 align:start position:0%
promote extra milk production to go with
 
00:50:09.119 --> 00:50:10.230 align:start position:0%
promote extra milk production to go with
cookies

00:50:10.230 --> 00:50:10.240 align:start position:0%
cookies
 
00:50:11.990 --> 00:50:12.000 align:start position:0%
having considered the same report the
 
00:50:13.670 --> 00:50:13.680 align:start position:0%
same with the following resolution that
 
00:50:15.670 --> 00:50:15.680 align:start position:0%
the bill be inexpedient to legislate
 
00:50:17.750 --> 00:50:17.760 align:start position:0%
senator weiler for the committee
 
00:50:18.950 --> 00:50:18.960 align:start position:0%
question before the house is the
 
00:50:20.710 --> 00:50:20.720 align:start position:0%
adoption of the committee report of
 
00:50:23.910 --> 00:50:23.920 align:start position:0%
inexpedient to legislate
 
00:50:25.589 --> 00:50:25.599 align:start position:0%
are you ready for the question
 
00:50:28.390 --> 00:50:28.400 align:start position:0%
all those in favor say aye
 
00:50:34.950 --> 00:50:34.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:39.109 --> 00:50:39.119 align:start position:0%
i was truly unsure what the vote was
 
00:50:42.470 --> 00:50:42.480 align:start position:0%
uh i i will tell you normally
 
00:50:44.870 --> 00:50:44.880 align:start position:0%
in this chamber unlike our outside
 
00:50:44.880 --> 00:50:45.990 align:start position:0%
in this chamber unlike our outside
venues

00:50:45.990 --> 00:50:46.000 align:start position:0%
venues
 
00:50:48.470 --> 00:50:48.480 align:start position:0%
uh where it was very hard to determine
 
00:50:51.270 --> 00:50:51.280 align:start position:0%
the the eyes and the nays
 
00:50:53.430 --> 00:50:53.440 align:start position:0%
that one i really truly couldn't
 
00:50:56.230 --> 00:50:56.240 align:start position:0%
determine it was about equal so
 
00:50:58.710 --> 00:50:58.720 align:start position:0%
we'll test the system one more time and
 
00:51:01.430 --> 00:51:01.440 align:start position:0%
have a division vote
 
00:51:03.430 --> 00:51:03.440 align:start position:0%
if you're in favor this is the the the
 
00:51:05.109 --> 00:51:05.119 align:start position:0%
motion before us is in expedient to
 
00:51:07.109 --> 00:51:07.119 align:start position:0%
legislator and house bill 99 this is
 
00:51:09.190 --> 00:51:09.200 align:start position:0%
division vote if you're in favor you'll
 
00:51:10.630 --> 00:51:10.640 align:start position:0%
press the green button if you're opposed
 
00:51:12.390 --> 00:51:12.400 align:start position:0%
you'll press the red button
 
00:51:57.510 --> 00:51:57.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:59.670 --> 00:51:59.680 align:start position:0%
just a very quick note there too for
 
00:52:01.589 --> 00:52:01.599 align:start position:0%
those of you who saw representative
 
00:52:03.109 --> 00:52:03.119 align:start position:0%
notter came in
 
00:52:05.270 --> 00:52:05.280 align:start position:0%
in the middle of a vote and our
 
00:52:08.470 --> 00:52:08.480 align:start position:0%
sergeant-at-arms just kicked her out so
 
00:52:10.309 --> 00:52:10.319 align:start position:0%
once we're in the voting mode nobody in
 
00:52:22.549 --> 00:52:22.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:24.470 --> 00:52:24.480 align:start position:0%
if all my president had an opportunity
 
00:52:25.510 --> 00:52:25.520 align:start position:0%
to vote
 
00:52:26.870 --> 00:52:26.880 align:start position:0%
house will attend to the state of the
 
00:52:26.880 --> 00:52:31.670 align:start position:0%
house will attend to the state of the
vote

00:52:31.670 --> 00:52:31.680 align:start position:0%

um

00:53:01.910 --> 00:53:01.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:04.710 --> 00:53:04.720 align:start position:0%
that's something that i i would um
 
00:53:06.470 --> 00:53:06.480 align:start position:0%
recommend a lot of times when we do
 
00:53:09.510 --> 00:53:09.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:11.750 --> 00:53:11.760 align:start position:0%
a lot of people don't vote
 
00:53:14.870 --> 00:53:14.880 align:start position:0%
and it can get very convoluted sometimes
 
00:53:19.430 --> 00:53:19.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:21.750 --> 00:53:21.760 align:start position:0%
when the question is put to you
 
00:53:24.230 --> 00:53:24.240 align:start position:0%
you do express your opinion one way or
 
00:53:26.710 --> 00:53:26.720 align:start position:0%
the other on a voice vote
 
00:53:29.430 --> 00:53:29.440 align:start position:0%
but it's a lot easier to determine in
 
00:53:32.309 --> 00:53:32.319 align:start position:0%
this chamber than it was outside it was
 
00:53:33.750 --> 00:53:33.760 align:start position:0%
very difficult
 
00:53:36.230 --> 00:53:36.240 align:start position:0%
because the room was so big on both over
 
00:53:37.670 --> 00:53:37.680 align:start position:0%
in bedford and
 
00:53:39.510 --> 00:53:39.520 align:start position:0%
uh at unh
 
00:53:42.870 --> 00:53:42.880 align:start position:0%
uh and and uh manchester
 
00:53:42.880 --> 00:53:49.510 align:start position:0%
uh and and uh manchester
um

00:53:49.510 --> 00:53:49.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:51.510 --> 00:53:51.520 align:start position:0%
we we had one more
 
00:53:51.520 --> 00:53:53.430 align:start position:0%
we we had one more
but

00:53:53.430 --> 00:53:53.440 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:53:55.109 --> 00:53:55.119 align:start position:0%
again i
 
00:53:56.710 --> 00:53:56.720 align:start position:0%
i don't think we need to get into one
 
00:53:57.910 --> 00:53:57.920 align:start position:0%
more uh
 
00:53:57.920 --> 00:54:00.800 align:start position:0%

00:56:01.990 --> 00:56:02.000 align:start position:0%
to the house for being the worst example
 
00:56:04.309 --> 00:56:04.319 align:start position:0%
of a representative that i've seen in
 
00:56:06.150 --> 00:56:06.160 align:start position:0%
quite some time
 
00:56:07.750 --> 00:56:07.760 align:start position:0%
but you know
 
00:56:10.150 --> 00:56:10.160 align:start position:0%
it matters reverence for the chamber
 
00:56:11.750 --> 00:56:11.760 align:start position:0%
think of the people that have stood here
 
00:56:14.710 --> 00:56:14.720 align:start position:0%
is a marker out front that says
 
00:56:16.630 --> 00:56:16.640 align:start position:0%
general lafayette was welcomed in this
 
00:56:22.069 --> 00:56:22.079 align:start position:0%
room in 1825 and when i first got here
 
00:56:25.349 --> 00:56:25.359 align:start position:0%
in 2010 realizing that i thought
 
00:56:27.349 --> 00:56:27.359 align:start position:0%
i try to need to be a better me when i'm
 
00:56:28.230 --> 00:56:28.240 align:start position:0%
in this
 
00:56:30.630 --> 00:56:30.640 align:start position:0%
room and be worthy of the chamber and i
 
00:56:33.510 --> 00:56:33.520 align:start position:0%
just i hope all of you feel that too
 
00:56:36.390 --> 00:56:36.400 align:start position:0%
and my sincerity in that and understand
 
00:56:39.190 --> 00:56:39.200 align:start position:0%
how painful this exercise was for me
 
00:56:39.200 --> 00:56:51.589 align:start position:0%
how painful this exercise was for me
today

00:56:51.589 --> 00:56:51.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:53.349 --> 00:56:53.359 align:start position:0%
representative osborne moves at the
 
00:56:55.109 --> 00:56:55.119 align:start position:0%

all supposed nay
 
00:57:06.789 --> 00:57:06.799 align:start position:0%
the eyes have it and the motion is
 
00:57:06.799 --> 00:57:07.910 align:start position:0%
the eyes have it and the motion is
adopted

00:57:07.910 --> 00:57:07.920 align:start position:0%
adopted
 
00:57:09.750 --> 00:57:09.760 align:start position:0%
the house is in recess until thursday
 
00:57:10.829 --> 00:57:10.839 align:start position:0%
march 10
 
00:57:10.839 --> 00:57:12.390 align:start position:0%
march 10
2022

00:57:12.390 --> 00:57:12.400 align:start position:0%
2022
 
00:57:17.589 --> 00:57:17.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:20.230 --> 00:57:20.240 align:start position:0%
uh yeah we don't need that
 
00:57:23.349 --> 00:57:23.359 align:start position:0%
so before before we leave what what we
 
00:57:25.589 --> 00:57:25.599 align:start position:0%
tried to do today is especially for the
 
00:57:25.599 --> 00:57:26.710 align:start position:0%
tried to do today is especially for the
freshmen

00:57:26.710 --> 00:57:26.720 align:start position:0%
freshmen
 
00:57:29.510 --> 00:57:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:31.190 --> 00:57:31.200 align:start position:0%
go over how
 
00:57:34.069 --> 00:57:34.079 align:start position:0%
we do things in the chamber
 
00:57:35.910 --> 00:57:35.920 align:start position:0%
and i know it's very similar as to what
 
00:57:37.750 --> 00:57:37.760 align:start position:0%
we did outside
 
00:57:39.910 --> 00:57:39.920 align:start position:0%
but there is quite a bit of difference
 
00:57:41.829 --> 00:57:41.839 align:start position:0%
once you're sitting in here
 
00:57:44.069 --> 00:57:44.079 align:start position:0%
than when we're in a
 
00:57:49.109 --> 00:57:49.119 align:start position:0%
55 or 35 000 square foot room
 
00:57:52.230 --> 00:57:52.240 align:start position:0%
decorum is is absolutely
 
00:57:54.150 --> 00:57:54.160 align:start position:0%
necessary for us to get through our
 
00:57:54.160 --> 00:57:55.750 align:start position:0%
necessary for us to get through our
business

00:57:55.750 --> 00:57:55.760 align:start position:0%
business
 
00:57:58.309 --> 00:57:58.319 align:start position:0%
and as i said earlier it will be
 
00:57:58.319 --> 00:58:00.390 align:start position:0%
and as i said earlier it will be
enforced

00:58:00.390 --> 00:58:00.400 align:start position:0%
enforced
 
00:58:00.400 --> 00:58:02.230 align:start position:0%
enforced
and

00:58:02.230 --> 00:58:02.240 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:58:02.240 --> 00:58:03.829 align:start position:0%
and
pis

00:58:03.829 --> 00:58:03.839 align:start position:0%
pis
 
00:58:06.630 --> 00:58:06.640 align:start position:0%
will be enforced
 
00:58:09.670 --> 00:58:09.680 align:start position:0%
no more novels no more books being read
 
00:58:13.829 --> 00:58:13.839 align:start position:0%
no more discussions a pi is a pi
 
00:58:13.839 --> 00:58:14.710 align:start position:0%
no more discussions a pi is a pi
and

00:58:14.710 --> 00:58:14.720 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:58:15.990 --> 00:58:16.000 align:start position:0%
we saw
 
00:58:18.789 --> 00:58:18.799 align:start position:0%
representative weber deliver a perfect
 
00:58:18.799 --> 00:58:19.670 align:start position:0%
representative weber deliver a perfect
one

00:58:19.670 --> 00:58:19.680 align:start position:0%
one
 
00:58:21.589 --> 00:58:21.599 align:start position:0%
over in
 
00:58:21.599 --> 00:58:22.470 align:start position:0%
over in
manchester

00:58:22.470 --> 00:58:22.480 align:start position:0%
manchester
 
00:58:24.789 --> 00:58:24.799 align:start position:0%
a couple of weeks ago
 
00:58:27.589 --> 00:58:27.599 align:start position:0%
that's what a proper pi is that's what
 
00:58:29.349 --> 00:58:29.359 align:start position:0%
it was
 
00:58:31.510 --> 00:58:31.520 align:start position:0%
they've gotten out of hand over the past
 
00:58:32.870 --> 00:58:32.880 align:start position:0%
few years
 
00:58:32.880 --> 00:58:33.670 align:start position:0%
few years
and

00:58:33.670 --> 00:58:33.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:58:35.589 --> 00:58:35.599 align:start position:0%
we're going to go back to doing proper
 
00:58:35.599 --> 00:58:38.470 align:start position:0%
we're going to go back to doing proper
pis

00:58:38.470 --> 00:58:38.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:42.150 --> 00:58:42.160 align:start position:0%
so what i'd like to do now is is
 
00:58:44.069 --> 00:58:44.079 align:start position:0%
open it up to questions for anybody that
 
00:58:45.589 --> 00:58:45.599 align:start position:0%
might have a question
 
00:58:48.309 --> 00:58:48.319 align:start position:0%
for myself the clerk
 
00:58:53.750 --> 00:58:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:56.230 --> 00:58:56.240 align:start position:0%
um uh the clerk does have a couple of
 
00:58:58.870 --> 00:58:58.880 align:start position:0%
quick more quick points to go over thank
 
00:59:00.549 --> 00:59:00.559 align:start position:0%
you mr speaker we i did get a couple of
 
00:59:03.510 --> 00:59:03.520 align:start position:0%
text messages um out during the during
 
00:59:05.510 --> 00:59:05.520 align:start position:0%
the course of this as as we sort of
 
00:59:07.510 --> 00:59:07.520 align:start position:0%
expected um
 
00:59:09.910 --> 00:59:09.920 align:start position:0%
one thing certainly that that that has
 
00:59:09.920 --> 00:59:11.030 align:start position:0%
one thing certainly that that that has
has

00:59:11.030 --> 00:59:11.040 align:start position:0%
has
 
00:59:14.390 --> 00:59:14.400 align:start position:0%
been a a uh a constant sort of annoyance

and uh if we have folks that are coming
 
01:01:04.710 --> 01:01:04.720 align:start position:0%
in and testifying they need to
 
01:01:06.549 --> 01:01:06.559 align:start position:0%
understand that they are still
 
01:01:09.670 --> 01:01:09.680 align:start position:0%

01:01:20.150 --> 01:01:20.160 align:start position:0%
there is no prohibition on that
 
01:01:21.990 --> 01:01:22.000 align:start position:0%
we do have a member
 
01:01:24.549 --> 01:01:24.559 align:start position:0%
a male member who has
 
01:01:24.559 --> 01:01:26.150 align:start position:0%

the speaker to wear a hat
 
01:01:34.069 --> 01:01:34.079 align:start position:0%
because of
 
01:01:34.079 --> 01:01:35.510 align:start position:0%
because of
exposure

01:01:35.510 --> 01:01:35.520 align:start position:0%
exposure
 
01:01:36.870 --> 01:01:36.880 align:start position:0%
so that is
 
01:01:38.390 --> 01:01:38.400 align:start position:0%
in those situations
 
01:01:39.990 --> 01:01:40.000 align:start position:0%
please see the speaker
 
01:01:42.309 --> 01:01:42.319 align:start position:0%
we will accommodate those things
 
01:01:44.950 --> 01:01:44.960 align:start position:0%
additional accommodations um from time
 
01:01:46.230 --> 01:01:46.240 align:start position:0%
to time
 
01:01:48.630 --> 01:01:48.640 align:start position:0%
members for whatever reason break their
 
01:01:50.470 --> 01:01:50.480 align:start position:0%
legs around here like it's going out of
 
01:01:50.480 --> 01:01:52.150 align:start position:0%
legs around here like it's going out of
style

01:01:52.150 --> 01:01:52.160 align:start position:0%
style
 
01:01:54.470 --> 01:01:54.480 align:start position:0%
and what happens is
 
01:01:57.430 --> 01:01:57.440 align:start position:0%
as you know in your seats it's sometimes
 
01:01:59.510 --> 01:01:59.520 align:start position:0%
hard to get in get out and that sort of
 
01:01:59.520 --> 01:02:00.230 align:start position:0%
hard to get in get out and that sort of
thing

01:02:00.230 --> 01:02:00.240 align:start position:0%
thing
 
01:02:02.309 --> 01:02:02.319 align:start position:0%
so what we will do if you coordinate
 
01:02:04.870 --> 01:02:04.880 align:start position:0%
with myself the speaker's office we will
 
01:02:07.349 --> 01:02:07.359 align:start position:0%
set up a chair
 
01:02:09.510 --> 01:02:09.520 align:start position:0%
usually in the back of division one or
 
01:02:12.470 --> 01:02:12.480 align:start position:0%
five for those members
 
01:02:14.549 --> 01:02:14.559 align:start position:0%
where they can stretch out and spread
 
01:02:16.230 --> 01:02:16.240 align:start position:0%
out and
 
01:02:18.549 --> 01:02:18.559 align:start position:0%

01:02:21.270 --> 01:02:21.280 align:start position:0%
each recorded vote so that i can record
 
01:02:23.670 --> 01:02:23.680 align:start position:0%
their up or down during session so
 
01:02:26.470 --> 01:02:26.480 align:start position:0%

for the team
 
01:02:55.589 --> 01:02:55.599 align:start position:0%
um in in crossing the well earlier uh
 
01:02:58.870 --> 01:02:58.880 align:start position:0%
she was was hijacked into doing that and
 
01:03:00.390 --> 01:03:00.400 align:start position:0%
she was a little concerned because she
 
01:03:02.789 --> 01:03:02.799 align:start position:0%
didn't want to be called out but she's
 
01:03:04.789 --> 01:03:04.799 align:start position:0%
she's a trooper so thank you for that i
 
01:03:07.270 --> 01:03:07.280 align:start position:0%
would just i would just mention um
 
01:03:08.549 --> 01:03:08.559 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
01:03:10.230 --> 01:03:10.240 align:start position:0%
our custom is
 
01:03:12.150 --> 01:03:12.160 align:start position:0%
it's actually more than a custom it is
 
01:03:14.549 --> 01:03:14.559 align:start position:0%
it is in masons that no one crosses in
 
01:03:16.710 --> 01:03:16.720 align:start position:0%
front of the speaker during during the
 
01:03:16.720 --> 01:03:17.750 align:start position:0%
front of the speaker during during the
session

01:03:17.750 --> 01:03:17.760 align:start position:0%
session
 
01:03:19.510 --> 01:03:19.520 align:start position:0%
you will often times see
 
01:03:23.510 --> 01:03:23.520 align:start position:0%
during the beginning of the day or
 
01:03:25.589 --> 01:03:25.599 align:start position:0%
coming back from lunch if
 
01:03:27.990 --> 01:03:28.000 align:start position:0%
we're getting ready and we have some
 
01:03:31.029 --> 01:03:31.039 align:start position:0%
members who are are moving a little slow
 
01:03:33.109 --> 01:03:33.119 align:start position:0%
a little slowly uh the speaker might
 
01:03:34.390 --> 01:03:34.400 align:start position:0%
step down
 
01:03:36.789 --> 01:03:36.799 align:start position:0%
to the floor so that the member can do
 
01:03:38.710 --> 01:03:38.720 align:start position:0%
so without without
 
01:03:39.750 --> 01:03:39.760 align:start position:0%
avoiding the
 
01:03:43.349 --> 01:03:43.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:45.670 --> 01:03:45.680 align:start position:0%
okay i have another text message
 
01:03:47.349 --> 01:03:47.359 align:start position:0%
sorry representative i'll be right there
 
01:03:47.359 --> 01:03:48.230 align:start position:0%
sorry representative i'll be right there
uh

01:03:48.230 --> 01:03:48.240 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:03:50.230 --> 01:03:50.240 align:start position:0%
i had a question asked uh should they
 
01:03:51.510 --> 01:03:51.520 align:start position:0%
push their white button to turn off
 
01:03:53.029 --> 01:03:53.039 align:start position:0%
their seat if they're going to use the
 
01:03:55.589 --> 01:03:55.599 align:start position:0%
restroom that helps us out it does help
 
01:03:57.829 --> 01:03:57.839 align:start position:0%
us out so if if you do need to go use
 
01:03:59.029 --> 01:03:59.039 align:start position:0%
the restroom
 
01:04:01.270 --> 01:04:01.280 align:start position:0%
if you turn off your station that means
 
01:04:03.910 --> 01:04:03.920 align:start position:0%
that i'm not looking for you
 
01:04:06.069 --> 01:04:06.079 align:start position:0%
when the vote has concluded so that is
 
01:04:07.430 --> 01:04:07.440 align:start position:0%
is helpful
 
01:04:09.270 --> 01:04:09.280 align:start position:0%
if you are able to do that
 
01:04:10.630 --> 01:04:10.640 align:start position:0%
if not
 
01:04:12.150 --> 01:04:12.160 align:start position:0%
it we're not going to send out the
 
01:04:20.150 --> 01:04:20.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:23.029 --> 01:04:23.039 align:start position:0%
what's the policy on the isles because i
 
01:04:25.270 --> 01:04:25.280 align:start position:0%
have seen it done both ways and i have
 
01:04:28.789 --> 01:04:28.799 align:start position:0%
had to apologize for doing it myself
 
01:04:32.309 --> 01:04:32.319 align:start position:0%
if i i in my first term
 
01:04:34.630 --> 01:04:34.640 align:start position:0%
we were only ever allowed to use the
 
01:04:36.549 --> 01:04:36.559 align:start position:0%
aisle between four and five and the
 
01:04:38.870 --> 01:04:38.880 align:start position:0%
aisle between one and two
 
01:04:41.349 --> 01:04:41.359 align:start position:0%
and in later terms
 
01:04:45.349 --> 01:04:45.359 align:start position:0%
the two middle aisles have been used but
 
01:04:47.349 --> 01:04:47.359 align:start position:0%
i know at least at one point i was
 
01:04:49.990 --> 01:04:50.000 align:start position:0%
required to apologize for walking down
 
01:04:51.829 --> 01:04:51.839 align:start position:0%
the aisle when somebody was standing
 
01:04:54.230 --> 01:04:54.240 align:start position:0%
here and speaking i didn't cross in
 
01:04:56.150 --> 01:04:56.160 align:start position:0%
front of the speaker but i
 
01:04:58.549 --> 01:04:58.559 align:start position:0%
did certainly obstruct the podium
 
01:05:01.190 --> 01:05:01.200 align:start position:0%
but i have also seen times when that has
 
01:05:03.910 --> 01:05:03.920 align:start position:0%
not been called out so i just wondered
 
01:05:06.309 --> 01:05:06.319 align:start position:0%
what the current policy was on the isles
 
01:05:07.910 --> 01:05:07.920 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative that
 
01:05:10.470 --> 01:05:10.480 align:start position:0%
is a perfect question um when members
 
01:05:12.870 --> 01:05:12.880 align:start position:0%
are speaking at the well
 
01:05:15.910 --> 01:05:15.920 align:start position:0%
from either podium you should not
 
01:05:19.109 --> 01:05:19.119 align:start position:0%
come down the aisle to either go
 
01:05:21.510 --> 01:05:21.520 align:start position:0%
out this door or
 
01:05:23.670 --> 01:05:23.680 align:start position:0%
to go to that corner while the member is
 
01:05:25.910 --> 01:05:25.920 align:start position:0%
speaking because you are especially now
 
01:05:27.430 --> 01:05:27.440 align:start position:0%
with our cameras where we are going to
 
01:05:30.470 --> 01:05:30.480 align:start position:0%
be having more of a focused angle it is
 
01:05:33.270 --> 01:05:33.280 align:start position:0%
um it is disrespectful to the member
 
01:05:35.510 --> 01:05:35.520 align:start position:0%
that is speaking because you are cutting
 
01:05:38.309 --> 01:05:38.319 align:start position:0%
off their speech if you are if you are
 
01:05:41.190 --> 01:05:41.200 align:start position:0%
in the first row and need to go out that
 
01:05:43.910 --> 01:05:43.920 align:start position:0%
way to use the facilities that's that's
 
01:05:45.750 --> 01:05:45.760 align:start position:0%
a different story there you're going out
 
01:05:48.470 --> 01:05:48.480 align:start position:0%
but to come down in front and cut off it
 
01:05:50.390 --> 01:05:50.400 align:start position:0%
is it is disrespectful to the member
 
01:05:54.150 --> 01:05:54.160 align:start position:0%
speaking um i have another one uh
 
01:05:56.390 --> 01:05:56.400 align:start position:0%
from as a request for our
 
01:06:00.710 --> 01:06:00.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:04.069 --> 01:06:04.079 align:start position:0%
we issue every one of you a security pin
 
01:06:05.750 --> 01:06:05.760 align:start position:0%
and a name tag
 
01:06:07.750 --> 01:06:07.760 align:start position:0%
granted some of you
 
01:06:10.150 --> 01:06:10.160 align:start position:0%
received your name tag
 
01:06:11.750 --> 01:06:11.760 align:start position:0%
30 years ago
 
01:06:14.230 --> 01:06:14.240 align:start position:0%
so you might not have one anymore
 
01:06:16.230 --> 01:06:16.240 align:start position:0%
but we do give out security pins at the
 
01:06:18.710 --> 01:06:18.720 align:start position:0%
beginning of each session for our
 
01:06:21.750 --> 01:06:21.760 align:start position:0%
sergeant-at-arms purposes uh for our our
 
01:06:23.910 --> 01:06:23.920 align:start position:0%
our doorkeepers at the back and and
 
01:06:26.549 --> 01:06:26.559 align:start position:0%
other folks if you could wear
 
01:06:28.630 --> 01:06:28.640 align:start position:0%
an identifying
 
01:06:28.640 --> 01:06:29.670 align:start position:0%
an identifying
badge

01:06:29.670 --> 01:06:29.680 align:start position:0%
badge
 
01:06:32.390 --> 01:06:32.400 align:start position:0%
name badge or your your pin
 
01:06:35.829 --> 01:06:35.839 align:start position:0%
it does help in terms of identifying
 
01:06:38.950 --> 01:06:38.960 align:start position:0%
and and trying to keep out other folks
 
01:06:41.029 --> 01:06:41.039 align:start position:0%
especially while we were off site there
 
01:06:43.750 --> 01:06:43.760 align:start position:0%
were frequent cases where
 
01:06:47.349 --> 01:06:47.359 align:start position:0%
non-members were coming onto the floor
 
01:06:49.990 --> 01:06:50.000 align:start position:0%
and in in some instances this actually
 
01:06:52.069 --> 01:06:52.079 align:start position:0%
happened during session
 
01:06:53.430 --> 01:06:53.440 align:start position:0%
and that is a
 
01:06:56.630 --> 01:06:56.640 align:start position:0%
strict strict no-no
 
01:06:58.549 --> 01:06:58.559 align:start position:0%
the only people that are allowed on the
 
01:07:00.870 --> 01:07:00.880 align:start position:0%
floor are the members
 
01:07:03.510 --> 01:07:03.520 align:start position:0%
staff and press but even press is
 
01:07:06.230 --> 01:07:06.240 align:start position:0%
limited to where they're supposed to be
 
01:07:07.910 --> 01:07:07.920 align:start position:0%
so please
 
01:07:10.230 --> 01:07:10.240 align:start position:0%
it would be helpful to our team if if
 
01:07:17.029 --> 01:07:17.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:19.510 --> 01:07:19.520 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry
 
01:07:22.150 --> 01:07:22.160 align:start position:0%
this year's color was green
 
01:07:24.870 --> 01:07:24.880 align:start position:0%
so if you should you should have a green
 
01:07:24.880 --> 01:07:25.990 align:start position:0%
so if you should you should have a green
pin

pin
 
01:07:27.430 --> 01:07:27.440 align:start position:0%
if you don't
 
01:07:32.549 --> 01:07:32.559 align:start position:0%

some of the parking spaces is that
 
01:12:49.270 --> 01:12:49.280 align:start position:0%
garage going to be totally ready for
 
01:12:51.750 --> 01:12:51.760 align:start position:0%
members who park in that garage and
 
01:12:53.350 --> 01:12:53.360 align:start position:0%
