00:13:34.850 --> 00:13:34.860 align:start position:0%

00:13:44.329 --> 00:13:44.339 align:start position:0%
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the
 
00:13:46.610 --> 00:13:46.620 align:start position:0%
United States of America and to the
 
00:13:49.009 --> 00:13:49.019 align:start position:0%
Republic for which it stands one nation
 
00:13:52.069 --> 00:13:52.079 align:start position:0%
under God indivisible with liberty and
 
00:13:55.970 --> 00:13:55.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:55.980 --> 00:13:57.530 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:13:57.530 --> 00:13:57.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:59.569 --> 00:13:59.579 align:start position:0%
so I want to thank everyone for being
 
00:13:59.579 --> 00:14:00.650 align:start position:0%
so I want to thank everyone for being
here

00:14:00.650 --> 00:14:00.660 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:14:03.170 --> 00:14:03.180 align:start position:0%
um it's obvious that this mission is
 
00:14:04.550 --> 00:14:04.560 align:start position:0%
very important
 
00:14:06.170 --> 00:14:06.180 align:start position:0%
um St Anselm College just came out with
 
00:14:08.030 --> 00:14:08.040 align:start position:0%
a great survey this month I just want to
 
00:14:09.769 --> 00:14:09.779 align:start position:0%
highlight some things
 
00:14:11.810 --> 00:14:11.820 align:start position:0%
um 78 of New Hampshire voters think that
 
00:14:13.190 --> 00:14:13.200 align:start position:0%
their communities need more affordable
 
00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:14.810 align:start position:0%
their communities need more affordable
housing

00:14:14.810 --> 00:14:14.820 align:start position:0%
housing
 
00:14:17.210 --> 00:14:17.220 align:start position:0%
58 of New Hampshire voters now want more
 
00:14:19.129 --> 00:14:19.139 align:start position:0%
affordable homes in their neighborhood
 
00:14:20.870 --> 00:14:20.880 align:start position:0%
sixty percent of New Hampshire thinks
 
00:14:22.069 --> 00:14:22.079 align:start position:0%
that our towns and cities should change
 
00:14:23.810 --> 00:14:23.820 align:start position:0%
land use regulations in order to allow
 
00:14:27.170 --> 00:14:27.180 align:start position:0%
more housing to be built so this survey
 
00:14:29.629 --> 00:14:29.639 align:start position:0%
um is kind of giving us our charge that
 
00:14:31.009 --> 00:14:31.019 align:start position:0%
we need to get something done here so
 
00:14:32.810 --> 00:14:32.820 align:start position:0%
hopefully some of these
 
00:14:35.210 --> 00:14:35.220 align:start position:0%
bills and pieces of legislation today we
 
00:14:37.670 --> 00:14:37.680 align:start position:0%
can file and really hopefully help move
 
00:14:40.129 --> 00:14:40.139 align:start position:0%
the ball in the right direction so
 
00:14:43.790 --> 00:14:43.800 align:start position:0%
um with that I have a a list to go and
 
00:14:45.650 --> 00:14:45.660 align:start position:0%
and I'm going to we're going to get
 
00:14:45.660 --> 00:14:46.910 align:start position:0%
and I'm going to we're going to get
started

00:14:46.910 --> 00:14:46.920 align:start position:0%
started
 
00:14:49.490 --> 00:14:49.500 align:start position:0%
so the first one I want to talk about I
 
00:14:51.949 --> 00:14:51.959 align:start position:0%
want to call on representative Wallace
 
00:14:54.069 --> 00:14:54.079 align:start position:0%
um this is regarding
 
00:14:57.170 --> 00:14:57.180 align:start position:0%
building code and revisiting
 
00:14:57.180 --> 00:14:58.030 align:start position:0%
building code and revisiting
um

00:14:58.030 --> 00:14:58.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:01.009 --> 00:15:01.019 align:start position:0%
an old amendment to a Senate bill so
 
00:15:02.569 --> 00:15:02.579 align:start position:0%
representative Wallace thank you
 
00:15:04.490 --> 00:15:04.500 align:start position:0%
chairman uh
 
00:15:07.129 --> 00:15:07.139 align:start position:0%
thanks for everybody uh joining us the
 
00:15:08.449 --> 00:15:08.459 align:start position:0%
end of the summer here
 
00:15:08.459 --> 00:15:09.230 align:start position:0%
end of the summer here
um

00:15:09.230 --> 00:15:09.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:12.050 --> 00:15:12.060 align:start position:0%
the intention with my amendment to
 
00:15:14.150 --> 00:15:14.160 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 78 which is now going to be
 
00:15:15.790 --> 00:15:15.800 align:start position:0%
a standalone bill
 
00:15:18.470 --> 00:15:18.480 align:start position:0%
was to address many of the concerns we
 
00:15:20.750 --> 00:15:20.760 align:start position:0%
heard from virtually every developer and
 
00:15:23.509 --> 00:15:23.519 align:start position:0%
Builder that uh testified before us in
 
00:15:26.410 --> 00:15:26.420 align:start position:0%
that they have run into situations where
 
00:15:29.509 --> 00:15:29.519 align:start position:0%
they get a project underway be it a
 
00:15:32.870 --> 00:15:32.880 align:start position:0%
subdivision some type of development and
 
00:15:35.090 --> 00:15:35.100 align:start position:0%
at that point in time when the project
 
00:15:35.100 --> 00:15:36.170 align:start position:0%
at that point in time when the project
was

00:15:36.170 --> 00:15:36.180 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:15:38.569 --> 00:15:38.579 align:start position:0%
given approval
 
00:15:40.550 --> 00:15:40.560 align:start position:0%
certain conditions were in place certain
 
00:15:42.050 --> 00:15:42.060 align:start position:0%
zoning ordinances certain fire
 
00:15:42.060 --> 00:15:44.329 align:start position:0%
zoning ordinances certain fire
ordinances

00:15:44.329 --> 00:15:44.339 align:start position:0%
ordinances
 
00:15:46.670 --> 00:15:46.680 align:start position:0%
Etc and then come time for final
 
00:15:50.750 --> 00:15:50.760 align:start position:0%
approval uh certificates of occupancy
 
00:15:50.760 --> 00:15:52.250 align:start position:0%
approval uh certificates of occupancy
um

00:15:52.250 --> 00:15:52.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:54.410 --> 00:15:54.420 align:start position:0%
things have changed on the ground
 
00:15:56.569 --> 00:15:56.579 align:start position:0%
uh according to you the local building
 
00:15:58.850 --> 00:15:58.860 align:start position:0%
officials but not according to uh
 
00:16:01.850 --> 00:16:01.860 align:start position:0%
statute or zoning ordinance so being
 
00:16:04.069 --> 00:16:04.079 align:start position:0%
that we as a legislature cannot make
 
00:16:07.430 --> 00:16:07.440 align:start position:0%
laws retrospectively we feel the same is
 
00:16:11.210 --> 00:16:11.220 align:start position:0%
is true of municipalities uh counties so
 
00:16:13.970 --> 00:16:13.980 align:start position:0%
what this bill would do is make sure
 
00:16:17.230 --> 00:16:17.240 align:start position:0%
that only the um
 
00:16:20.449 --> 00:16:20.459 align:start position:0%
zoning ordinances regulations uh and
 
00:16:22.730 --> 00:16:22.740 align:start position:0%
conditions in effect at the time of
 
00:16:26.030 --> 00:16:26.040 align:start position:0%
approval uh issuance of building permit
 
00:16:27.769 --> 00:16:27.779 align:start position:0%
Etc would be
 
00:16:29.389 --> 00:16:29.399 align:start position:0%
those would be the only conditions that
 
00:16:31.910 --> 00:16:31.920 align:start position:0%
needed to be met for final sign off on
 
00:16:34.810 --> 00:16:34.820 align:start position:0%
any of the projects so this is
 
00:16:36.829 --> 00:16:36.839 align:start position:0%
preliminary at this point we've got to
 
00:16:39.530 --> 00:16:39.540 align:start position:0%
make some we've had some input from uh a
 
00:16:41.389 --> 00:16:41.399 align:start position:0%
variety of individuals Benjamin Frost in
 
00:16:43.730 --> 00:16:43.740 align:start position:0%
particular he's got some good details
 
00:16:45.350 --> 00:16:45.360 align:start position:0%
that we need to tighten up a bit but
 
00:16:48.170 --> 00:16:48.180 align:start position:0%
that's what this bill will do
 
00:16:53.090 --> 00:16:53.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:53.100 --> 00:16:54.050 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:16:54.050 --> 00:16:54.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:58.730 --> 00:16:58.740 align:start position:0%
thank you for that explanation I just am
 
00:17:00.829 --> 00:17:00.839 align:start position:0%
looking at this language here and it
 
00:17:04.730 --> 00:17:04.740 align:start position:0%
doesn't seem to be
 
00:17:06.890 --> 00:17:06.900 align:start position:0%
the same way that you described it
 
00:17:10.010 --> 00:17:10.020 align:start position:0%
seemed like you were talking about like
 
00:17:12.289 --> 00:17:12.299 align:start position:0%
um when you're proposing a plan and that
 
00:17:14.689 --> 00:17:14.699 align:start position:0%
it gets accepted by the board and then
 
00:17:17.449 --> 00:17:17.459 align:start position:0%
before exception and approval something
 
00:17:23.030 --> 00:17:23.040 align:start position:0%
changes then you uh are not required to
 
00:17:25.429 --> 00:17:25.439 align:start position:0%
meet those additional changes
 
00:17:28.909 --> 00:17:28.919 align:start position:0%
um but the language on
 
00:17:32.690 --> 00:17:32.700 align:start position:0%
on 10 and line
 
00:17:37.190 --> 00:17:37.200 align:start position:0%
18 seem to both be that the
 
00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:37.909 align:start position:0%
18 seem to both be that the
um

00:17:37.909 --> 00:17:37.919 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:17:41.029 --> 00:17:41.039 align:start position:0%
the subdivision or plot was approved
 
00:17:43.370 --> 00:17:43.380 align:start position:0%
and recorded at the registry of D's and
 
00:17:46.270 --> 00:17:46.280 align:start position:0%
that only occurs like once it's actually
 
00:17:50.630 --> 00:17:50.640 align:start position:0%
finalized and so so I think that that at
 
00:17:52.010 --> 00:17:52.020 align:start position:0%
least this language is talking about
 
00:17:54.409 --> 00:17:54.419 align:start position:0%
after it's recorded at the registry of
 
00:17:57.590 --> 00:17:57.600 align:start position:0%
deeds additional changes not like when
 
00:18:00.529 --> 00:18:00.539 align:start position:0%
it's it's getting proposed and saying
 
00:18:03.289 --> 00:18:03.299 align:start position:0%
like at the at the Town level you know
 
00:18:05.870 --> 00:18:05.880 align:start position:0%
the planning board accepts uh proposal
 
00:18:07.730 --> 00:18:07.740 align:start position:0%
is complete and they've started their
 
00:18:09.950 --> 00:18:09.960 align:start position:0%
clock as far as like
 
00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:10.810 align:start position:0%
clock as far as like
um

00:18:10.810 --> 00:18:10.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:13.610 --> 00:18:13.620 align:start position:0%
uh how long they have to decide and
 
00:18:15.409 --> 00:18:15.419 align:start position:0%
stuff like that can you
 
00:18:17.990 --> 00:18:18.000 align:start position:0%
um address that
 
00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:18.590 align:start position:0%
um address that
um

00:18:18.590 --> 00:18:18.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:20.330 --> 00:18:20.340 align:start position:0%
that kind of time frame because it
 
00:18:22.250 --> 00:18:22.260 align:start position:0%
doesn't seem to drive what what you were
 
00:18:24.110 --> 00:18:24.120 align:start position:0%
explaining yes and actually that was
 
00:18:27.049 --> 00:18:27.059 align:start position:0%
also pointed out by uh Ben Frost and in
 
00:18:29.150 --> 00:18:29.160 align:start position:0%
particular on lines 11 to 12 and again
 
00:18:32.450 --> 00:18:32.460 align:start position:0%
on 19 and 20. it refers to site plans
 
00:18:35.090 --> 00:18:35.100 align:start position:0%
being recorded since they typically
 
00:18:36.650 --> 00:18:36.660 align:start position:0%
aren't record unless there's some aspect
 
00:18:39.409 --> 00:18:39.419 align:start position:0%
of the plan that affects the title I
 
00:18:41.630 --> 00:18:41.640 align:start position:0%
we're going to strike and properly
 
00:18:44.150 --> 00:18:44.160 align:start position:0%
recorded So that way that that would be
 
00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:46.430 align:start position:0%
recorded So that way that that would be
addressed

00:18:46.430 --> 00:18:46.440 align:start position:0%
addressed
 
00:18:48.350 --> 00:18:48.360 align:start position:0%
and I'll circulate this email to the to
 
00:18:50.289 --> 00:18:50.299 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
00:18:53.630 --> 00:18:53.640 align:start position:0%
okay so if I'm understanding you there's
 
00:18:55.250 --> 00:18:55.260 align:start position:0%
going to be some changes to that
 
00:18:57.890 --> 00:18:57.900 align:start position:0%
Amendment and we'll forward that to the
 
00:18:57.900 --> 00:18:58.909 align:start position:0%
Amendment and we'll forward that to the
committee

00:18:58.909 --> 00:18:58.919 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:19:01.430 --> 00:19:01.440 align:start position:0%
so that we can evaluate that before we
 
00:19:03.650 --> 00:19:03.660 align:start position:0%
sign off on it
 
00:19:06.529 --> 00:19:06.539 align:start position:0%
yeah Damon
 
00:19:08.570 --> 00:19:08.580 align:start position:0%
so just to clarify what you just said
 
00:19:10.970 --> 00:19:10.980 align:start position:0%
represented Wallace if we're looking at
 
00:19:14.330 --> 00:19:14.340 align:start position:0%
lines 1819 are you saying you would be
 
00:19:16.549 --> 00:19:16.559 align:start position:0%
removing the words and properly recorded
 
00:19:20.090 --> 00:19:20.100 align:start position:0%

00:19:36.650 --> 00:19:36.660 align:start position:0%
um thank you representative Wallace I
 
00:19:39.710 --> 00:19:39.720 align:start position:0%
um the the email that uh representative
 
00:19:41.810 --> 00:19:41.820 align:start position:0%
Wallace is referring to is one I sent to
 
00:19:44.029 --> 00:19:44.039 align:start position:0%
him in which I had reviewed this and
 
00:19:47.690 --> 00:19:47.700 align:start position:0%
pointed out to him that uh it's
 
00:19:50.990 --> 00:19:51.000 align:start position:0%
um extremely rare in fact for site plans
 
00:19:52.730 --> 00:19:52.740 align:start position:0%
approved by a planning board to be
 
00:19:54.409 --> 00:19:54.419 align:start position:0%
recorded in the registry of deeds only
 
00:19:56.750 --> 00:19:56.760 align:start position:0%
where they affect the property interest
 
00:19:59.390 --> 00:19:59.400 align:start position:0%
by changing boundaries or clarifying
 
00:20:02.029 --> 00:20:02.039 align:start position:0%
boundaries or having a recorded easement
 
00:20:05.450 --> 00:20:05.460 align:start position:0%
would that be the case and in fact
 
00:20:05.460 --> 00:20:06.289 align:start position:0%
would that be the case and in fact
um

00:20:06.289 --> 00:20:06.299 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:09.710 --> 00:20:09.720 align:start position:0%
pursuant to the the Platt law which is I
 
00:20:12.130 --> 00:20:12.140 align:start position:0%
forget the citation RSA 478 something
 
00:20:18.409 --> 00:20:18.419 align:start position:0%
478 1-8 1-8 there you go thank you uh a
 
00:20:21.529 --> 00:20:21.539 align:start position:0%
register of deeds can properly refuse to
 
00:20:24.289 --> 00:20:24.299 align:start position:0%
record a site plan unless it has
 
00:20:27.830 --> 00:20:27.840 align:start position:0%
something within the plat law on the
 
00:20:29.570 --> 00:20:29.580 align:start position:0%
plan and it is that sort of property
 
00:20:31.430 --> 00:20:31.440 align:start position:0%
interest so subdivisions
 
00:20:33.830 --> 00:20:33.840 align:start position:0%
always should be recorded site plans
 
00:20:36.770 --> 00:20:36.780 align:start position:0%
rarely are recorded
 
00:20:38.810 --> 00:20:38.820 align:start position:0%
if I can continue one thing I think
 
00:20:41.270 --> 00:20:41.280 align:start position:0%
representative urkela was also asking
 
00:20:44.690 --> 00:20:44.700 align:start position:0%
the question about what happens when a
 
00:20:47.210 --> 00:20:47.220 align:start position:0%
an application is pending before the
 
00:20:49.789 --> 00:20:49.799 align:start position:0%
board it's an accepted principle of law
 
00:20:53.390 --> 00:20:53.400 align:start position:0%
that those are protected from changes so
 
00:20:55.610 --> 00:20:55.620 align:start position:0%
while while an application is pending
 
00:20:58.070 --> 00:20:58.080 align:start position:0%
before a planning board it is subject to
 
00:21:00.049 --> 00:21:00.059 align:start position:0%
the rules that were in place at the time
 
00:21:02.210 --> 00:21:02.220 align:start position:0%
the application was accepted by the
 
00:21:04.970 --> 00:21:04.980 align:start position:0%
planning board or perhaps depending upon
 
00:21:06.830 --> 00:21:06.840 align:start position:0%
how you look at it when the application
 
00:21:09.049 --> 00:21:09.059 align:start position:0%
was filed with the planning board and
 
00:21:10.730 --> 00:21:10.740 align:start position:0%
there is a there's a case
 
00:21:13.570 --> 00:21:13.580 align:start position:0%
on that filing question that goes back
 
00:21:16.370 --> 00:21:16.380 align:start position:0%
many years I forget the citation I'd be
 
00:21:18.409 --> 00:21:18.419 align:start position:0%
happy to supply it to the committee if
 
00:21:19.549 --> 00:21:19.559 align:start position:0%
you wish
 
00:21:22.310 --> 00:21:22.320 align:start position:0%
there's also a statute that deals with
 
00:21:25.669 --> 00:21:25.679 align:start position:0%
this sort of protection of pending
 
00:21:30.850 --> 00:21:30.860 align:start position:0%
applications that is the design the
 
00:21:30.860 --> 00:21:32.409 align:start position:0%
applications that is the design the
preliminary

00:21:32.409 --> 00:21:32.419 align:start position:0%
preliminary
 
00:21:35.930 --> 00:21:35.940 align:start position:0%
concept well the design review phase of
 
00:21:38.090 --> 00:21:38.100 align:start position:0%
planning Board review so before they
 
00:21:41.870 --> 00:21:41.880 align:start position:0%
file an application if a call it a
 
00:21:44.570 --> 00:21:44.580 align:start position:0%
pre-applicant the property owner or
 
00:21:47.630 --> 00:21:47.640 align:start position:0%
developer files a design review pursuant
 
00:21:49.450 --> 00:21:49.460 align:start position:0%
to the planning boards
 
00:21:52.490 --> 00:21:52.500 align:start position:0%
adopted procedures then that is
 
00:21:54.770 --> 00:21:54.780 align:start position:0%
protected from changes
 
00:21:59.149 --> 00:21:59.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:00.950 --> 00:22:00.960 align:start position:0%
starting at the time the planning board
 
00:22:03.649 --> 00:22:03.659 align:start position:0%
declares design review to be complete so
 
00:22:05.750 --> 00:22:05.760 align:start position:0%
it the design review might last three
 
00:22:08.690 --> 00:22:08.700 align:start position:0%
four months and assume these iterative
 
00:22:10.909 --> 00:22:10.919 align:start position:0%
meetings uh in consultation with the
 
00:22:13.190 --> 00:22:13.200 align:start position:0%
planning board that are not binding but
 
00:22:15.710 --> 00:22:15.720 align:start position:0%
if if the developers proposed something
 
00:22:18.110 --> 00:22:18.120 align:start position:0%
under design review that is protected
 
00:22:21.710 --> 00:22:21.720 align:start position:0%
for a year from changes to subdivision
 
00:22:23.870 --> 00:22:23.880 align:start position:0%
regulations site plan regulations zoning
 
00:22:26.450 --> 00:22:26.460 align:start position:0%
zoning ordinances
 
00:22:28.490 --> 00:22:28.500 align:start position:0%
and during that time during that year
 
00:22:31.130 --> 00:22:31.140 align:start position:0%
the applicant can then file a formal
 
00:22:34.610 --> 00:22:34.620 align:start position:0%
application under the rules that were in
 
00:22:38.149 --> 00:22:38.159 align:start position:0%
effect at the time design review started
 
00:22:40.549 --> 00:22:40.559 align:start position:0%
so there is protection for pending
 
00:22:42.169 --> 00:22:42.179 align:start position:0%
applications and even some
 
00:22:42.179 --> 00:22:45.049 align:start position:0%
applications and even some
pre-applications

00:22:45.049 --> 00:22:45.059 align:start position:0%
pre-applications
 
00:22:48.289 --> 00:22:48.299 align:start position:0%
representative Walsh
 
00:22:49.909 --> 00:22:49.919 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and you might be able
 
00:22:52.130 --> 00:22:52.140 align:start position:0%
to help me on this too memory wise I
 
00:22:53.750 --> 00:22:53.760 align:start position:0%
didn't see it in here
 
00:22:53.760 --> 00:22:55.730 align:start position:0%
didn't see it in here
um

00:22:55.730 --> 00:22:55.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:22:59.510 --> 00:22:59.520 align:start position:0%
does this mean that an approved plan for
 
00:23:02.690 --> 00:23:02.700 align:start position:0%
subdivision would be approved Forever
 
00:23:02.700 --> 00:23:04.130 align:start position:0%
subdivision would be approved Forever
Without

00:23:04.130 --> 00:23:04.140 align:start position:0%
Without
 
00:23:06.289 --> 00:23:06.299 align:start position:0%
have allowing any changes so because we
 
00:23:07.970 --> 00:23:07.980 align:start position:0%
run into this there's there's also
 
00:23:10.250 --> 00:23:10.260 align:start position:0%
something in statute about a vested
 
00:23:11.570 --> 00:23:11.580 align:start position:0%
property with a certain amount of
 
00:23:13.070 --> 00:23:13.080 align:start position:0%
percentage of improvements done to the
 
00:23:15.289 --> 00:23:15.299 align:start position:0%
infrastructure to get that best thing
 
00:23:17.029 --> 00:23:17.039 align:start position:0%
that makes it forever
 
00:23:18.890 --> 00:23:18.900 align:start position:0%
because a lot of things can happen I I
 
00:23:21.110 --> 00:23:21.120 align:start position:0%
just let me throw an example if you get
 
00:23:23.510 --> 00:23:23.520 align:start position:0%
an approved subdivision and it sits
 
00:23:24.890 --> 00:23:24.900 align:start position:0%
there for three years in the meantime
 
00:23:26.570 --> 00:23:26.580 align:start position:0%
the aot permits have changed this
 
00:23:29.149 --> 00:23:29.159 align:start position:0%
permit's changed unless there's
 
00:23:32.770 --> 00:23:32.780 align:start position:0%
significant Improvement to the property
 
00:23:35.149 --> 00:23:35.159 align:start position:0%
they can still be required to make those
 
00:23:38.330 --> 00:23:38.340 align:start position:0%
changes would this exempt that in other
 
00:23:39.830 --> 00:23:39.840 align:start position:0%
words if this is the direction we want
 
00:23:41.570 --> 00:23:41.580 align:start position:0%
to go by giving basically everything
 
00:23:43.250 --> 00:23:43.260 align:start position:0%
here vesting
 
00:23:44.990 --> 00:23:45.000 align:start position:0%
or do we have to look at the other
 
00:23:47.810 --> 00:23:47.820 align:start position:0%
chapter and make some strikes did that
 
00:23:50.930 --> 00:23:50.940 align:start position:0%
come out what is your um view on that
 
00:23:53.570 --> 00:23:53.580 align:start position:0%
that's a great question Mr chairman
 
00:23:55.490 --> 00:23:55.500 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Walsh in fact
 
00:23:57.710 --> 00:23:57.720 align:start position:0%
that that very issue that you're
 
00:24:01.010 --> 00:24:01.020 align:start position:0%
describing is this statute that would be
 
00:24:03.770 --> 00:24:03.780 align:start position:0%
repealed and replaced okay uh and the
 
00:24:05.750 --> 00:24:05.760 align:start position:0%
the issue that you're pointing out goes
 
00:24:08.990 --> 00:24:09.000 align:start position:0%
back a number of years it was 2004 that
 
00:24:11.810 --> 00:24:11.820 align:start position:0%
this statute was changed in response to
 
00:24:13.310 --> 00:24:13.320 align:start position:0%
a New Hampshire Supreme Court decision
 
00:24:15.529 --> 00:24:15.539 align:start position:0%
involving the city of Rochester where
 
00:24:17.810 --> 00:24:17.820 align:start position:0%
there was question about whether a
 
00:24:20.870 --> 00:24:20.880 align:start position:0%
portion of a development had vested and
 
00:24:23.990 --> 00:24:24.000 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court found that uh it it in
 
00:24:26.450 --> 00:24:26.460 align:start position:0%
fact it had vested based on the level of
 
00:24:28.909 --> 00:24:28.919 align:start position:0%
improvements this replaces that entire
 
00:24:30.310 --> 00:24:30.320 align:start position:0%
statute okay
 
00:24:32.450 --> 00:24:32.460 align:start position:0%
to help deal with that would you
 
00:24:35.450 --> 00:24:35.460 align:start position:0%
recommend another area of the RSA to a
 
00:24:38.450 --> 00:24:38.460 align:start position:0%
support this legislation
 
00:24:40.669 --> 00:24:40.679 align:start position:0%
no I think this is the this is the right
 
00:24:42.110 --> 00:24:42.120 align:start position:0%
place to put it is there is there
 
00:24:44.029 --> 00:24:44.039 align:start position:0%
language to
 
00:24:46.850 --> 00:24:46.860 align:start position:0%
address those concerns because I I see
 
00:24:48.950 --> 00:24:48.960 align:start position:0%
those as concerns too I think it would
 
00:24:51.409 --> 00:24:51.419 align:start position:0%
be unnecessary unnecessary okay yeah no
 
00:24:53.750 --> 00:24:53.760 align:start position:0%
and I if I can I think I'm fine with the
 
00:24:55.549 --> 00:24:55.559 align:start position:0%
two just wanted to make sure we were
 
00:24:57.470 --> 00:24:57.480 align:start position:0%
okay and I don't remember all the
 
00:25:01.669 --> 00:25:01.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:04.130 --> 00:25:04.140 align:start position:0%
okay so is there anybody else I'd like
 
00:25:05.510 --> 00:25:05.520 align:start position:0%
to speak on this I know Bill's here I
 
00:25:06.770 --> 00:25:06.780 align:start position:0%
just want to make sure would you like to
 
00:25:09.770 --> 00:25:09.780 align:start position:0%
come up and go ahead
 
00:25:18.529 --> 00:25:18.539 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:19.789 --> 00:25:19.799 align:start position:0%
good morning
 
00:25:21.710 --> 00:25:21.720 align:start position:0%
um chairman Alexander and representative
 
00:25:24.070 --> 00:25:24.080 align:start position:0%
Wallace uh thank you
 
00:25:26.750 --> 00:25:26.760 align:start position:0%
to speak thank you is that better thank
 
00:25:28.549 --> 00:25:28.559 align:start position:0%
you yes thank you for the opportunity to
 
00:25:30.110 --> 00:25:30.120 align:start position:0%
speak my name is Bill McKinney I'm the
 
00:25:31.130 --> 00:25:31.140 align:start position:0%
president of the New Hampshire building
 
00:25:33.890 --> 00:25:33.900 align:start position:0%
officials Association and we have uh um
 
00:25:36.289 --> 00:25:36.299 align:start position:0%
some sincerest interest in this uh
 
00:25:39.470 --> 00:25:39.480 align:start position:0%
proposal here most of most of which
 
00:25:41.870 --> 00:25:41.880 align:start position:0%
concerns unintended consequences from
 
00:25:43.970 --> 00:25:43.980 align:start position:0%
this proposal
 
00:25:46.669 --> 00:25:46.679 align:start position:0%
um as we look at this bill we start to
 
00:25:49.190 --> 00:25:49.200 align:start position:0%
look at we don't understand if this is
 
00:25:52.070 --> 00:25:52.080 align:start position:0%
retroactive to all existing Lots all
 
00:25:54.529 --> 00:25:54.539 align:start position:0%
existing subdivisions dating back to
 
00:25:56.810 --> 00:25:56.820 align:start position:0%
when I know I've dealt in subdivisions
 
00:25:58.970 --> 00:25:58.980 align:start position:0%
that have were approved back in the
 
00:26:00.950 --> 00:26:00.960 align:start position:0%
1970s and we're still building on
 
00:26:03.409 --> 00:26:03.419 align:start position:0%
existing Lots from those now
 
00:26:05.810 --> 00:26:05.820 align:start position:0%
due to that we believe that this bill
 
00:26:08.149 --> 00:26:08.159 align:start position:0%
could actually cause for further delays
 
00:26:10.370 --> 00:26:10.380 align:start position:0%
in permit issuances and delays in
 
00:26:10.380 --> 00:26:12.710 align:start position:0%
in permit issuances and delays in
construction

00:26:12.710 --> 00:26:12.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:14.990 --> 00:26:15.000 align:start position:0%
number one is access to outdated codes
 
00:26:17.269 --> 00:26:17.279 align:start position:0%
many building departments don't have
 
00:26:19.549 --> 00:26:19.559 align:start position:0%
code the code books that still that
 
00:26:21.590 --> 00:26:21.600 align:start position:0%
would have been in existence back for a
 
00:26:26.390 --> 00:26:26.400 align:start position:0%
subdivision Back in 1970 or 72. so some
 
00:26:28.909 --> 00:26:28.919 align:start position:0%
of your larger municipalities may have
 
00:26:30.830 --> 00:26:30.840 align:start position:0%
decent libraries but you smaller
 
00:26:32.390 --> 00:26:32.400 align:start position:0%
communities they don't have the room
 
00:26:35.630 --> 00:26:35.640 align:start position:0%
they don't have the ability to maintain
 
00:26:38.690 --> 00:26:38.700 align:start position:0%
all the additions of the codes that
 
00:26:40.970 --> 00:26:40.980 align:start position:0%
would be necessary
 
00:26:43.909 --> 00:26:43.919 align:start position:0%
access to those codes is also quite
 
00:26:46.630 --> 00:26:46.640 align:start position:0%
impossible at times the night the
 
00:26:50.630 --> 00:26:50.640 align:start position:0%
1985 or 1985 Boca code is probably not
 
00:26:52.490 --> 00:26:52.500 align:start position:0%
around the cable code is probably not
 
00:26:53.990 --> 00:26:54.000 align:start position:0%
around anymore because they've been
 
00:26:56.570 --> 00:26:56.580 align:start position:0%
replaced by the international codes the
 
00:26:58.010 --> 00:26:58.020 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire adopted the
 
00:27:00.590 --> 00:27:00.600 align:start position:0%
international codes in 2001. so any
 
00:27:02.510 --> 00:27:02.520 align:start position:0%
subdivision prior to that could be very
 
00:27:04.250 --> 00:27:04.260 align:start position:0%
difficult to even find a code that you
 
00:27:06.890 --> 00:27:06.900 align:start position:0%
could you could reference
 
00:27:09.350 --> 00:27:09.360 align:start position:0%
um familiar familiarity with outdated
 
00:27:09.360 --> 00:27:10.430 align:start position:0%
um familiar familiarity with outdated
codes

00:27:10.430 --> 00:27:10.440 align:start position:0%
codes
 
00:27:12.950 --> 00:27:12.960 align:start position:0%
inspectors today are being trained to
 
00:27:14.570 --> 00:27:14.580 align:start position:0%
the most current codes that are adopted
 
00:27:16.490 --> 00:27:16.500 align:start position:0%
by the state of New Hampshire we are not
 
00:27:19.310 --> 00:27:19.320 align:start position:0%
teaching what was what was taught in the
 
00:27:21.230 --> 00:27:21.240 align:start position:0%
prior codes of cable and Boca anymore
 
00:27:24.950 --> 00:27:24.960 align:start position:0%
they don't exist so as our classes are
 
00:27:28.149 --> 00:27:28.159 align:start position:0%
now we're now teaching to the 2021 codes
 
00:27:31.490 --> 00:27:31.500 align:start position:0%
as the state is under the 2018 but we're
 
00:27:35.029 --> 00:27:35.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:36.529 --> 00:27:36.539 align:start position:0%
I think this bill will bring in
 
00:27:38.570 --> 00:27:38.580 align:start position:0%
conflicts between the with the state
 
00:27:41.330 --> 00:27:41.340 align:start position:0%
building and fire codes which states
 
00:27:43.730 --> 00:27:43.740 align:start position:0%
were quite clear in state law that we
 
00:27:46.130 --> 00:27:46.140 align:start position:0%
must provide provide for the provisions
 
00:27:48.289 --> 00:27:48.299 align:start position:0%
of code that provide the greatest degree
 
00:27:51.710 --> 00:27:51.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:53.990 --> 00:27:54.000 align:start position:0%
is failure of Prior codes to recognize
 
00:27:55.730 --> 00:27:55.740 align:start position:0%
more current building materials and
 
00:27:58.130 --> 00:27:58.140 align:start position:0%
processes leading to costly submittals
 
00:27:59.810 --> 00:27:59.820 align:start position:0%
and delays if you look at the newer
 
00:28:01.669 --> 00:28:01.679 align:start position:0%
codes and the materials and and
 
00:28:03.890 --> 00:28:03.900 align:start position:0%
especially with engineered products now
 
00:28:05.330 --> 00:28:05.340 align:start position:0%
that are that are being put into homes
 
00:28:07.390 --> 00:28:07.400 align:start position:0%
that aren't natural products anymore
 
00:28:11.269 --> 00:28:11.279 align:start position:0%
those those are now included in the code
 
00:28:13.610 --> 00:28:13.620 align:start position:0%
if we don't have that code available to
 
00:28:15.529 --> 00:28:15.539 align:start position:0%
us and we're now looking at a house that
 
00:28:17.510 --> 00:28:17.520 align:start position:0%
was a subdivision that was proved in the
 
00:28:20.570 --> 00:28:20.580 align:start position:0%
1960s or 70s you're now looking at that
 
00:28:22.070 --> 00:28:22.080 align:start position:0%
person that developer would have to
 
00:28:24.649 --> 00:28:24.659 align:start position:0%
submit all the engineering detail in all
 
00:28:26.450 --> 00:28:26.460 align:start position:0%
of the engineering data and information
 
00:28:29.750 --> 00:28:29.760 align:start position:0%
for us to to have in order to make an
 
00:28:32.029 --> 00:28:32.039 align:start position:0%
educated decision that's time consuming
 
00:28:33.830 --> 00:28:33.840 align:start position:0%
and it's costly to the Builder the codes
 
00:28:36.049 --> 00:28:36.059 align:start position:0%
are starting to recognize this and
 
00:28:37.789 --> 00:28:37.799 align:start position:0%
they're bringing these items into the
 
00:28:37.799 --> 00:28:39.529 align:start position:0%
they're bringing these items into the
codes

00:28:39.529 --> 00:28:39.539 align:start position:0%
codes
 
00:28:41.810 --> 00:28:41.820 align:start position:0%
there's there's more advanced systems
 
00:28:43.909 --> 00:28:43.919 align:start position:0%
that are out there especially with HVAC
 
00:28:45.649 --> 00:28:45.659 align:start position:0%
and plumbing and electrical systems that
 
00:28:47.390 --> 00:28:47.400 align:start position:0%
make the homes more efficient less
 
00:28:50.630 --> 00:28:50.640 align:start position:0%
costly for the homeowner
 
00:28:52.490 --> 00:28:52.500 align:start position:0%
there's a failure of the older codes to
 
00:28:54.230 --> 00:28:54.240 align:start position:0%
recognize proven life safety
 
00:28:56.750 --> 00:28:56.760 align:start position:0%
requirements smoke alarms are carbon
 
00:28:59.570 --> 00:28:59.580 align:start position:0%
monoxide detectors are some of the
 
00:29:01.190 --> 00:29:01.200 align:start position:0%
biggest they didn't exist in the codes
 
00:29:04.130 --> 00:29:04.140 align:start position:0%
in the 1970s they do exist in there and
 
00:29:06.470 --> 00:29:06.480 align:start position:0%
now the next biggest one is lateral load
 
00:29:08.750 --> 00:29:08.760 align:start position:0%
connection for for decks I'm sure if you
 
00:29:10.310 --> 00:29:10.320 align:start position:0%
want to do some research you'll see the
 
00:29:12.590 --> 00:29:12.600 align:start position:0%
statistics on Deck collapses injuries
 
00:29:14.690 --> 00:29:14.700 align:start position:0%
and deaths that result each year from
 
00:29:17.390 --> 00:29:17.400 align:start position:0%
properly connected decks to homes
 
00:29:20.149 --> 00:29:20.159 align:start position:0%
um the prior codes also do not recognize
 
00:29:23.029 --> 00:29:23.039 align:start position:0%
the evolution of lumber Lumber and
 
00:29:26.269 --> 00:29:26.279 align:start position:0%
dimension reductions a two by four is no
 
00:29:29.750 --> 00:29:29.760 align:start position:0%
longer a true two by four anymore it's
 
00:29:33.049 --> 00:29:33.059 align:start position:0%
one and a half by one maybe one by
 
00:29:34.669 --> 00:29:34.679 align:start position:0%
three and three three and three quarters
 
00:29:34.679 --> 00:29:36.350 align:start position:0%
three and three three and three quarters
so

00:29:36.350 --> 00:29:36.360 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:29:39.169 --> 00:29:39.179 align:start position:0%
so because of that the codes as they
 
00:29:41.510 --> 00:29:41.520 align:start position:0%
evolve recognize that the lumber is not
 
00:29:43.610 --> 00:29:43.620 align:start position:0%
the strength that it used to be in the
 
00:29:45.889 --> 00:29:45.899 align:start position:0%
codes address that we start to deal with
 
00:29:49.970 --> 00:29:49.980 align:start position:0%
the impacts on rafter and joist spans
 
00:29:52.070 --> 00:29:52.080 align:start position:0%
prior codes do not provide for the
 
00:29:54.470 --> 00:29:54.480 align:start position:0%
current increase to ground snow loads if
 
00:29:56.149 --> 00:29:56.159 align:start position:0%
and I'm sure all of you can remember
 
00:29:58.850 --> 00:29:58.860 align:start position:0%
years ago we used to get very deep light
 
00:30:01.610 --> 00:30:01.620 align:start position:0%
snow and it was it would blow around we
 
00:30:03.470 --> 00:30:03.480 align:start position:0%
don't get that anymore whether that's
 
00:30:05.690 --> 00:30:05.700 align:start position:0%
global warming or climate change the
 
00:30:07.370 --> 00:30:07.380 align:start position:0%
snow that we're receiving is is much
 
00:30:09.470 --> 00:30:09.480 align:start position:0%
more dense it has a lot more weight to
 
00:30:11.269 --> 00:30:11.279 align:start position:0%
it due to that the newer codes are
 
00:30:13.130 --> 00:30:13.140 align:start position:0%
recognized recognize that and have
 
00:30:14.750 --> 00:30:14.760 align:start position:0%
increased the snow loadings for roof
 
00:30:14.760 --> 00:30:18.230 align:start position:0%
increased the snow loadings for roof
structures

00:30:18.230 --> 00:30:18.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:21.590 --> 00:30:21.600 align:start position:0%
and last the process of adopting codes
 
00:30:25.190 --> 00:30:25.200 align:start position:0%
is about 18 to 24 months that's after
 
00:30:27.289 --> 00:30:27.299 align:start position:0%
the review from the building code review
 
00:30:29.389 --> 00:30:29.399 align:start position:0%
board so you're truthfully looking at
 
00:30:33.049 --> 00:30:33.059 align:start position:0%
relatively three years to adopt a more
 
00:30:35.029 --> 00:30:35.039 align:start position:0%
current edition of the code where there
 
00:30:36.889 --> 00:30:36.899 align:start position:0%
are public hearings held educational
 
00:30:39.590 --> 00:30:39.600 align:start position:0%
processes happen and even after the code
 
00:30:41.630 --> 00:30:41.640 align:start position:0%
is signed by the governor we have a
 
00:30:43.250 --> 00:30:43.260 align:start position:0%
six-month delay period in there for
 
00:30:45.230 --> 00:30:45.240 align:start position:0%
further education and bringing everybody
 
00:30:47.750 --> 00:30:47.760 align:start position:0%
up to speed and what that six month does
 
00:30:49.970 --> 00:30:49.980 align:start position:0%
is that if you have a development that
 
00:30:52.789 --> 00:30:52.799 align:start position:0%
was approved during that time and your
 
00:30:54.830 --> 00:30:54.840 align:start position:0%
permits were issued
 
00:30:58.130 --> 00:30:58.140 align:start position:0%
those buildings stay under that code so
 
00:31:00.350 --> 00:31:00.360 align:start position:0%
it's already in State Statute that
 
00:31:02.570 --> 00:31:02.580 align:start position:0%
protects developments what it doesn't do
 
00:31:04.310 --> 00:31:04.320 align:start position:0%
is it doesn't forever protect a
 
00:31:08.389 --> 00:31:08.399 align:start position:0%
development that goes on for decades
 
00:31:11.810 --> 00:31:11.820 align:start position:0%
maybe even several decades before homes
 
00:31:13.610 --> 00:31:13.620 align:start position:0%
are being built and the codes are far
 
00:31:16.310 --> 00:31:16.320 align:start position:0%
more advanced in the Life Safety aspects
 
00:31:18.950 --> 00:31:18.960 align:start position:0%
I really believe that some work needs to
 
00:31:20.930 --> 00:31:20.940 align:start position:0%
be done to this to address what the
 
00:31:23.049 --> 00:31:23.059 align:start position:0%
primary concerns are of our legislators
 
00:31:25.850 --> 00:31:25.860 align:start position:0%
and what I typically find that these
 
00:31:27.769 --> 00:31:27.779 align:start position:0%
bills come out because there's been an
 
00:31:29.990 --> 00:31:30.000 align:start position:0%
issue where somebody didn't interpret
 
00:31:32.330 --> 00:31:32.340 align:start position:0%
code correctly and made someone do
 
00:31:33.769 --> 00:31:33.779 align:start position:0%
something that they really didn't have
 
00:31:35.870 --> 00:31:35.880 align:start position:0%
to and with that I would accept any
 
00:31:35.880 --> 00:31:37.870 align:start position:0%
to and with that I would accept any
questions

00:31:37.870 --> 00:31:37.880 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:31:40.370 --> 00:31:40.380 align:start position:0%
thank you uh
 
00:31:43.310 --> 00:31:43.320 align:start position:0%
the intent was not to address anything
 
00:31:45.409 --> 00:31:45.419 align:start position:0%
that's been in the past and frankly I
 
00:31:47.810 --> 00:31:47.820 align:start position:0%
had no idea that we still had uh
 
00:31:49.669 --> 00:31:49.679 align:start position:0%
developments that are going on that were
 
00:31:51.769 --> 00:31:51.779 align:start position:0%
approved in the 1970s that's not the
 
00:31:53.630 --> 00:31:53.640 align:start position:0%
intent of this at all
 
00:31:55.490 --> 00:31:55.500 align:start position:0%
um I expect it to be a bit more
 
00:31:58.970 --> 00:31:58.980 align:start position:0%
contemporaneous than 1970 so that being
 
00:32:00.710 --> 00:32:00.720 align:start position:0%
said would certainly have a provision in
 
00:32:02.389 --> 00:32:02.399 align:start position:0%
there that uh you know this would be
 
00:32:04.669 --> 00:32:04.679 align:start position:0%
modern codes going forward you know we
 
00:32:06.950 --> 00:32:06.960 align:start position:0%
could even put a timeline be more than
 
00:32:09.289 --> 00:32:09.299 align:start position:0%
happy to work with you on that say
 
00:32:11.870 --> 00:32:11.880 align:start position:0%
um say for example we haven't approved
 
00:32:15.350 --> 00:32:15.360 align:start position:0%
subdivision from the 1970s I think would
 
00:32:17.090 --> 00:32:17.100 align:start position:0%
all be okay with saying okay well it's
 
00:32:18.830 --> 00:32:18.840 align:start position:0%
got to meet modern building codes
 
00:32:20.710 --> 00:32:20.720 align:start position:0%
because the construction is starting now
 
00:32:24.710 --> 00:32:24.720 align:start position:0%
that's not what we're looking to do
 
00:32:26.810 --> 00:32:26.820 align:start position:0%
um the intent of this bill was to make
 
00:32:30.289 --> 00:32:30.299 align:start position:0%
it so that uh we didn't have let's call
 
00:32:33.529 --> 00:32:33.539 align:start position:0%
it corruption going on or uh you know a
 
00:32:36.470 --> 00:32:36.480 align:start position:0%
Shakedown of a developer a particularly
 
00:32:38.990 --> 00:32:39.000 align:start position:0%
municipality might want something done
 
00:32:40.490 --> 00:32:40.500 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:32:42.649 --> 00:32:42.659 align:start position:0%
kind of a quid pro quo you want to get
 
00:32:44.090 --> 00:32:44.100 align:start position:0%
the approval on this well we want a
 
00:32:45.409 --> 00:32:45.419 align:start position:0%
playground on the other side of town
 
00:32:47.029 --> 00:32:47.039 align:start position:0%
one's got nothing to do with the other
 
00:32:49.010 --> 00:32:49.020 align:start position:0%
that's the intent with this so we're
 
00:32:50.269 --> 00:32:50.279 align:start position:0%
more than happy to work with you on that
 
00:32:50.279 --> 00:32:51.350 align:start position:0%
more than happy to work with you on that
bill

00:32:51.350 --> 00:32:51.360 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:32:52.669 --> 00:32:52.679 align:start position:0%
excellent if you'd like to provide
 
00:32:54.649 --> 00:32:54.659 align:start position:0%
someone yeah some suggested language
 
00:32:57.590 --> 00:32:57.600 align:start position:0%
we'll work it right in
 
00:32:59.990 --> 00:33:00.000 align:start position:0%
I think yeah I think so I'm I'm going to
 
00:33:01.310 --> 00:33:01.320 align:start position:0%
charge representative Wallace will work
 
00:33:04.250 --> 00:33:04.260 align:start position:0%
with you and um Mr Frost and make sure
 
00:33:05.450 --> 00:33:05.460 align:start position:0%
that we get this language down because
 
00:33:07.549 --> 00:33:07.559 align:start position:0%
this is really an important bill that
 
00:33:09.830 --> 00:33:09.840 align:start position:0%
hopefully can come out of this committee
 
00:33:12.529 --> 00:33:12.539 align:start position:0%
um the idea is is once something's
 
00:33:14.029 --> 00:33:14.039 align:start position:0%
approved we want to move forward with it
 
00:33:16.430 --> 00:33:16.440 align:start position:0%
and hopefully
 
00:33:17.990 --> 00:33:18.000 align:start position:0%
um all of these concerns are addressed
 
00:33:20.389 --> 00:33:20.399 align:start position:0%
during the application process and not
 
00:33:22.909 --> 00:33:22.919 align:start position:0%
after the process is over so that is the
 
00:33:24.169 --> 00:33:24.179 align:start position:0%
intent of the build
 
00:33:26.810 --> 00:33:26.820 align:start position:0%
thank you Bill thank you
 
00:33:26.820 --> 00:33:28.730 align:start position:0%
thank you Bill thank you
representative

00:33:28.730 --> 00:33:28.740 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:33:31.789 --> 00:33:31.799 align:start position:0%
I guess I have a couple of thoughts that
 
00:33:33.649 --> 00:33:33.659 align:start position:0%
if if the
 
00:33:33.659 --> 00:33:35.330 align:start position:0%
if if the
if the

00:33:35.330 --> 00:33:35.340 align:start position:0%
if the
 
00:33:40.250 --> 00:33:40.260 align:start position:0%
um building or the the plot was approved
 
00:33:41.930 --> 00:33:41.940 align:start position:0%
and built
 
00:33:43.850 --> 00:33:43.860 align:start position:0%
and it could still be existing from the
 
00:33:47.149 --> 00:33:47.159 align:start position:0%
60s or the 50s or the 40s with those
 
00:33:47.159 --> 00:33:48.889 align:start position:0%
60s or the 50s or the 40s with those
existing

00:33:48.889 --> 00:33:48.899 align:start position:0%
existing
 
00:33:52.310 --> 00:33:52.320 align:start position:0%
built to those standards
 
00:33:52.320 --> 00:33:54.529 align:start position:0%
built to those standards
um

00:33:54.529 --> 00:33:54.539 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:58.310 --> 00:33:58.320 align:start position:0%
I don't understand why if that you would
 
00:34:01.070 --> 00:34:01.080 align:start position:0%
have to do
 
00:34:03.470 --> 00:34:03.480 align:start position:0%
something else other than what was
 
00:34:06.350 --> 00:34:06.360 align:start position:0%
approved like we're like we're allowing
 
00:34:08.629 --> 00:34:08.639 align:start position:0%
people to still live in those homes that
 
00:34:10.970 --> 00:34:10.980 align:start position:0%
were built in the 70s like why couldn't
 
00:34:10.980 --> 00:34:12.050 align:start position:0%
were built in the 70s like why couldn't
they

00:34:12.050 --> 00:34:12.060 align:start position:0%
they
 
00:34:16.369 --> 00:34:16.379 align:start position:0%
be living in the home built today
 
00:34:16.379 --> 00:34:17.629 align:start position:0%
be living in the home built today
those

00:34:17.629 --> 00:34:17.639 align:start position:0%
those
 
00:34:19.250 --> 00:34:19.260 align:start position:0%
building materials are probably no
 
00:34:21.230 --> 00:34:21.240 align:start position:0%
longer available you're not going to get
 
00:34:23.329 --> 00:34:23.339 align:start position:0%
an actual two inch by four inch two by
 
00:34:25.490 --> 00:34:25.500 align:start position:0%
four so
 
00:34:26.990 --> 00:34:27.000 align:start position:0%
um and I don't think that any Builder is
 
00:34:28.669 --> 00:34:28.679 align:start position:0%
going to be building
 
00:34:31.070 --> 00:34:31.080 align:start position:0%
what we would call War homes uh in
 
00:34:31.080 --> 00:34:32.030 align:start position:0%
what we would call War homes uh in
current

00:34:32.030 --> 00:34:32.040 align:start position:0%
current
 
00:34:33.530 --> 00:34:33.540 align:start position:0%
in the current conditions I don't think
 
00:34:39.349 --> 00:34:39.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:40.909 --> 00:34:40.919 align:start position:0%
I'll say
 
00:34:44.089 --> 00:34:44.099 align:start position:0%
okay is there any anybody else to go
 
00:34:51.230 --> 00:34:51.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:54.349 --> 00:34:54.359 align:start position:0%
Bill McKinney president nhboa
 
00:34:57.170 --> 00:34:57.180 align:start position:0%
again the building codes often and
 
00:34:59.089 --> 00:34:59.099 align:start position:0%
they're directed now to start addressing
 
00:35:01.609 --> 00:35:01.619 align:start position:0%
the issues of of what's more current
 
00:35:04.790 --> 00:35:04.800 align:start position:0%
which is climate change global warming
 
00:35:06.829 --> 00:35:06.839 align:start position:0%
whichever you want to go to and as you
 
00:35:08.329 --> 00:35:08.339 align:start position:0%
can see the storms that we're starting
 
00:35:10.670 --> 00:35:10.680 align:start position:0%
to see nationally and internationally
 
00:35:14.210 --> 00:35:14.220 align:start position:0%
are much more intense so wind loading in
 
00:35:16.250 --> 00:35:16.260 align:start position:0%
fact for is a key key issue wind loading
 
00:35:18.770 --> 00:35:18.780 align:start position:0%
in the 1970s was far less than the wind
 
00:35:20.270 --> 00:35:20.280 align:start position:0%
loading requirements that are in the
 
00:35:22.250 --> 00:35:22.260 align:start position:0%
code now so does that cause an impact
 
00:35:24.050 --> 00:35:24.060 align:start position:0%
and a cost to the to the developer
 
00:35:26.210 --> 00:35:26.220 align:start position:0%
absolutely but does it make for a more
 
00:35:28.190 --> 00:35:28.200 align:start position:0%
resilient Community I think that's more
 
00:35:30.890 --> 00:35:30.900 align:start position:0%
important too snow loading is a key
 
00:35:33.410 --> 00:35:33.420 align:start position:0%
issue snow loading ends up on roofs
 
00:35:35.510 --> 00:35:35.520 align:start position:0%
because as I stated it earlier the snow
 
00:35:37.370 --> 00:35:37.380 align:start position:0%
has changed the consistency of the snow
 
00:35:39.650 --> 00:35:39.660 align:start position:0%
has changed but also we put far greater
 
00:35:41.390 --> 00:35:41.400 align:start position:0%
insulation in the attics that doesn't
 
00:35:43.190 --> 00:35:43.200 align:start position:0%
allow for the heat loss that used to
 
00:35:45.109 --> 00:35:45.119 align:start position:0%
melt the snow off the roofs
 
00:35:48.170 --> 00:35:48.180 align:start position:0%
so a house in the 1970s that was built
 
00:35:50.270 --> 00:35:50.280 align:start position:0%
you'll probably see and you take some
 
00:35:51.770 --> 00:35:51.780 align:start position:0%
time and look around you'll start to see
 
00:35:53.690 --> 00:35:53.700 align:start position:0%
the sags in the roof right the SAG and
 
00:35:55.849 --> 00:35:55.859 align:start position:0%
the Ridgeline because now you've
 
00:35:57.109 --> 00:35:57.119 align:start position:0%
probably found that they've insulated
 
00:35:59.270 --> 00:35:59.280 align:start position:0%
their home to much better insulation
 
00:36:01.670 --> 00:36:01.680 align:start position:0%
factors than the 1970s but now that's
 
00:36:03.770 --> 00:36:03.780 align:start position:0%
starting to impact their the structure
 
00:36:06.170 --> 00:36:06.180 align:start position:0%
of their house the rafters that are
 
00:36:07.790 --> 00:36:07.800 align:start position:0%
there aren't strong enough to carry that
 
00:36:10.430 --> 00:36:10.440 align:start position:0%
snow load any longer so there are
 
00:36:14.270 --> 00:36:14.280 align:start position:0%
several reasons why staying with an
 
00:36:16.490 --> 00:36:16.500 align:start position:0%
outdated code that doesn't
 
00:36:19.069 --> 00:36:19.079 align:start position:0%
recognize current environmental
 
00:36:22.849 --> 00:36:22.859 align:start position:0%
conditions and see even is not really a
 
00:36:25.310 --> 00:36:25.320 align:start position:0%
wise route to go I don't think
 
00:36:28.430 --> 00:36:28.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:30.650 --> 00:36:30.660 align:start position:0%
um my
 
00:36:33.109 --> 00:36:33.119 align:start position:0%
I I'm familiar with
 
00:36:33.119 --> 00:36:34.550 align:start position:0%
I I'm familiar with
um

00:36:34.550 --> 00:36:34.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:38.290 --> 00:36:38.300 align:start position:0%
some I guess
 
00:36:42.290 --> 00:36:42.300 align:start position:0%
my my home was built in like the 50s and
 
00:36:45.829 --> 00:36:45.839 align:start position:0%
if I replace something like I just
 
00:36:49.569 --> 00:36:49.579 align:start position:0%
replaced my roof
 
00:36:49.579 --> 00:36:51.130 align:start position:0%
replaced my roof
and

00:36:51.130 --> 00:36:51.140 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:36:55.370 --> 00:36:55.380 align:start position:0%
I replaced it with the same
 
00:36:59.210 --> 00:36:59.220 align:start position:0%
setup that was previously there
 
00:36:59.220 --> 00:37:02.089 align:start position:0%
setup that was previously there
um

00:37:02.089 --> 00:37:02.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:05.450 --> 00:37:05.460 align:start position:0%
aren't we don't we normally allow from
 
00:37:08.870 --> 00:37:08.880 align:start position:0%
for some type of like
 
00:37:12.230 --> 00:37:12.240 align:start position:0%
um like replacing of existing conditions
 
00:37:14.690 --> 00:37:14.700 align:start position:0%
on the ground no even if those
 
00:37:17.930 --> 00:37:17.940 align:start position:0%
conditions on the ground aren't optimal
 
00:37:17.940 --> 00:37:21.349 align:start position:0%
conditions on the ground aren't optimal
currently

00:37:21.349 --> 00:37:21.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:23.690 --> 00:37:23.700 align:start position:0%
yes building code and the existing
 
00:37:25.550 --> 00:37:25.560 align:start position:0%
building code which is also adopted by
 
00:37:27.589 --> 00:37:27.599 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire allows for
 
00:37:29.450 --> 00:37:29.460 align:start position:0%
existing conditions to remain with
 
00:37:31.730 --> 00:37:31.740 align:start position:0%
certain certain conditions
 
00:37:33.410 --> 00:37:33.420 align:start position:0%
um provided that that renovation or
 
00:37:34.970 --> 00:37:34.980 align:start position:0%
alteration area doesn't exceed 50
 
00:37:38.870 --> 00:37:38.880 align:start position:0%
percent of your your work area or 50
 
00:37:41.089 --> 00:37:41.099 align:start position:0%
percent of the aggregate floor area of
 
00:37:43.190 --> 00:37:43.200 align:start position:0%
the building which includes all Floors
 
00:37:45.290 --> 00:37:45.300 align:start position:0%
Plus the basement in the state of New
 
00:37:47.870 --> 00:37:47.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire by an amended definition
 
00:37:50.089 --> 00:37:50.099 align:start position:0%
um so yes if you are replacing your roof
 
00:37:52.490 --> 00:37:52.500 align:start position:0%
it wouldn't re mean that you would have
 
00:37:55.310 --> 00:37:55.320 align:start position:0%
to replace all of the rafters and the
 
00:37:56.930 --> 00:37:56.940 align:start position:0%
whole structure you could actually go
 
00:37:59.510 --> 00:37:59.520 align:start position:0%
and replace the roofing materials and
 
00:38:05.810 --> 00:38:05.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:07.970 --> 00:38:07.980 align:start position:0%
so couldn't that same logic be applied
 
00:38:07.980 --> 00:38:09.530 align:start position:0%
so couldn't that same logic be applied
to

00:38:09.530 --> 00:38:09.540 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:38:09.540 --> 00:38:11.150 align:start position:0%
to
um

00:38:11.150 --> 00:38:11.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:15.109 --> 00:38:15.119 align:start position:0%
the the what the the language in this is
 
00:38:17.510 --> 00:38:17.520 align:start position:0%
talking about as far as
 
00:38:17.520 --> 00:38:18.230 align:start position:0%
talking about as far as
um

00:38:18.230 --> 00:38:18.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:22.670 --> 00:38:22.680 align:start position:0%
let's say that that uh that the
 
00:38:24.589 --> 00:38:24.599 align:start position:0%
regulations and the regulations and the
 
00:38:27.770 --> 00:38:27.780 align:start position:0%
fire code and all of this shall be
 
00:38:31.130 --> 00:38:31.140 align:start position:0%
um exempt as long as
 
00:38:34.730 --> 00:38:34.740 align:start position:0%
let's say the the changes don't exceed
 
00:38:38.990 --> 00:38:39.000 align:start position:0%
50 of the the structure
 
00:38:41.690 --> 00:38:41.700 align:start position:0%
or or the you know the plan or whatever
 
00:38:43.910 --> 00:38:43.920 align:start position:0%
the case that's a very good question and
 
00:38:45.349 --> 00:38:45.359 align:start position:0%
that's already addressed in the building
 
00:38:47.829 --> 00:38:47.839 align:start position:0%
codes and in the existing building code
 
00:38:51.770 --> 00:38:51.780 align:start position:0%
so repairs maintenance of buildings
 
00:38:54.710 --> 00:38:54.720 align:start position:0%
alterations Renovations provided you'd
 
00:38:57.650 --> 00:38:57.660 align:start position:0%
only exceed the 50 the what it would say
 
00:39:00.410 --> 00:39:00.420 align:start position:0%
is that if you're doing alterations to
 
00:39:02.450 --> 00:39:02.460 align:start position:0%
that area the alterations would need to
 
00:39:04.310 --> 00:39:04.320 align:start position:0%
meet code in that specific area but you
 
00:39:05.450 --> 00:39:05.460 align:start position:0%
would not have to bring the whole
 
00:39:08.870 --> 00:39:08.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:11.510 --> 00:39:11.520 align:start position:0%
representative walls thank you question
 
00:39:12.530 --> 00:39:12.540 align:start position:0%
for you
 
00:39:14.990 --> 00:39:15.000 align:start position:0%
um on some of these older subdivisions
 
00:39:17.690 --> 00:39:17.700 align:start position:0%
or any of the the developers that are
 
00:39:19.250 --> 00:39:19.260 align:start position:0%
still building them building the
 
00:39:21.770 --> 00:39:21.780 align:start position:0%
buildings to the old
 
00:39:23.390 --> 00:39:23.400 align:start position:0%
code or are they building modern
 
00:39:26.390 --> 00:39:26.400 align:start position:0%
buildings on these Lots
 
00:39:29.150 --> 00:39:29.160 align:start position:0%
if you can answer that yes in the
 
00:39:30.710 --> 00:39:30.720 align:start position:0%
subdivisions that I've been involved
 
00:39:32.210 --> 00:39:32.220 align:start position:0%
with they are building to the modern
 
00:39:34.790 --> 00:39:34.800 align:start position:0%
code because that is the what they're
 
00:39:36.950 --> 00:39:36.960 align:start position:0%
applying for at the time of application
 
00:39:38.690 --> 00:39:38.700 align:start position:0%
for a building permit
 
00:39:40.970 --> 00:39:40.980 align:start position:0%
so unlike
 
00:39:43.849 --> 00:39:43.859 align:start position:0%
land use regulations where you may have
 
00:39:45.890 --> 00:39:45.900 align:start position:0%
the determination of substantial
 
00:39:49.430 --> 00:39:49.440 align:start position:0%
completion and vested rights the
 
00:39:52.310 --> 00:39:52.320 align:start position:0%
building and fire codes don't have that
 
00:39:55.370 --> 00:39:55.380 align:start position:0%
which and again I I believe is the right
 
00:39:58.130 --> 00:39:58.140 align:start position:0%
path because of the advances that come
 
00:39:58.140 --> 00:39:59.690 align:start position:0%
path because of the advances that come
from

00:39:59.690 --> 00:39:59.700 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:40:02.270 --> 00:40:02.280 align:start position:0%
into the building codes from natural
 
00:40:04.510 --> 00:40:04.520 align:start position:0%
disasters from
 
00:40:08.510 --> 00:40:08.520 align:start position:0%
develop improvements to products in the
 
00:40:10.670 --> 00:40:10.680 align:start position:0%
construction industry new methods of
 
00:40:13.010 --> 00:40:13.020 align:start position:0%
constructing all of this keeps evolving
 
00:40:14.510 --> 00:40:14.520 align:start position:0%
and I think we need to keep up with that
 
00:40:14.520 --> 00:40:17.150 align:start position:0%
and I think we need to keep up with that
evolution

00:40:17.150 --> 00:40:17.160 align:start position:0%
evolution
 
00:40:20.210 --> 00:40:20.220 align:start position:0%
would you be comfortable with uh let's
 
00:40:23.810 --> 00:40:23.820 align:start position:0%
take a 19 mid 1970s subdivision approval
 
00:40:25.990 --> 00:40:26.000 align:start position:0%
that may have
 
00:40:28.329 --> 00:40:28.339 align:start position:0%
non-conforming lots by today's
 
00:40:31.490 --> 00:40:31.500 align:start position:0%
ordinances but they're using modern
 
00:40:34.849 --> 00:40:34.859 align:start position:0%
building uh building practices would you
 
00:40:36.589 --> 00:40:36.599 align:start position:0%
be comfortable with language that would
 
00:40:38.870 --> 00:40:38.880 align:start position:0%
leave the uh
 
00:40:40.970 --> 00:40:40.980 align:start position:0%
the subdivision lot sizes or whatever
 
00:40:42.890 --> 00:40:42.900 align:start position:0%
those conditions might be the way they
 
00:40:47.870 --> 00:40:47.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:49.730 --> 00:40:49.740 align:start position:0%
I don't see where that would be a
 
00:40:51.950 --> 00:40:51.960 align:start position:0%
problem the building codes are a lot
 
00:40:56.210 --> 00:40:56.220 align:start position:0%
less stringent on building lot sizes and
 
00:41:02.569 --> 00:41:02.579 align:start position:0%
uh lot line uh separations and setbacks
 
00:41:04.790 --> 00:41:04.800 align:start position:0%
the building code doesn't recognize that
 
00:41:07.130 --> 00:41:07.140 align:start position:0%
and we'll in most cases will allow you
 
00:41:08.810 --> 00:41:08.820 align:start position:0%
to build as close as three feet to a
 
00:41:12.109 --> 00:41:12.119 align:start position:0%
property line where most local zoning
 
00:41:14.990 --> 00:41:15.000 align:start position:0%
regulations do not correct
 
00:41:18.109 --> 00:41:18.119 align:start position:0%
but representative De Lorenzo thank you
 
00:41:19.910 --> 00:41:19.920 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and thank you for taking my
 
00:41:23.589 --> 00:41:23.599 align:start position:0%
question I I'm wondering um how much
 
00:41:27.050 --> 00:41:27.060 align:start position:0%
financing and insurance
 
00:41:29.690 --> 00:41:29.700 align:start position:0%
our factor in the building Renovations
 
00:41:31.370 --> 00:41:31.380 align:start position:0%
that are allowed
 
00:41:34.430 --> 00:41:34.440 align:start position:0%
you know for um
 
00:41:39.349 --> 00:41:39.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:41.750 --> 00:41:41.760 align:start position:0%
I would have to defer to someone that is
 
00:41:43.310 --> 00:41:43.320 align:start position:0%
much more knowledgeable in the banking
 
00:41:45.290 --> 00:41:45.300 align:start position:0%
industry and the insurance industry than
 
00:41:47.930 --> 00:41:47.940 align:start position:0%
I but I would suspect that
 
00:41:49.550 --> 00:41:49.560 align:start position:0%
um not building to a more current
 
00:41:51.650 --> 00:41:51.660 align:start position:0%
building code the insurance companies
 
00:41:54.589 --> 00:41:54.599 align:start position:0%
might not look upon that fondly also we
 
00:41:56.690 --> 00:41:56.700 align:start position:0%
need to also remember that you know um
 
00:41:58.670 --> 00:41:58.680 align:start position:0%
FEMA who is you know a Federal
 
00:41:58.680 --> 00:42:00.589 align:start position:0%
FEMA who is you know a Federal
Regulation

00:42:00.589 --> 00:42:00.599 align:start position:0%
Regulation
 
00:42:02.630 --> 00:42:02.640 align:start position:0%
um if there's any federal money involved
 
00:42:04.849 --> 00:42:04.859 align:start position:0%
in any rebuilding or reconstructing of
 
00:42:07.010 --> 00:42:07.020 align:start position:0%
these subdivisions they would have to be
 
00:42:09.710 --> 00:42:09.720 align:start position:0%
built to the most current code directed
 
00:42:12.109 --> 00:42:12.119 align:start position:0%
by FEMA so there's there's a lot of
 
00:42:14.569 --> 00:42:14.579 align:start position:0%
federal requirements as well as state
 
00:42:17.030 --> 00:42:17.040 align:start position:0%
requirements involved here but yes I I
 
00:42:18.890 --> 00:42:18.900 align:start position:0%
do suspect the insurance industry and
 
00:42:20.750 --> 00:42:20.760 align:start position:0%
the lenders would have an issue with a
 
00:42:22.910 --> 00:42:22.920 align:start position:0%
building not to current code
 
00:42:25.970 --> 00:42:25.980 align:start position:0%
may I follow up yes and that brings to
 
00:42:28.069 --> 00:42:28.079 align:start position:0%
mind the recent flooding that we've had
 
00:42:30.589 --> 00:42:30.599 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire how much is that going
 
00:42:35.150 --> 00:42:35.160 align:start position:0%
to affect changing the code to meet the
 
00:42:38.630 --> 00:42:38.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:41.170 --> 00:42:41.180 align:start position:0%
older building codes did not recognize
 
00:42:44.470 --> 00:42:44.480 align:start position:0%
floodplains such as the newer codes do
 
00:42:47.630 --> 00:42:47.640 align:start position:0%
construction in flood Plains is often
 
00:42:49.730 --> 00:42:49.740 align:start position:0%
permitted provided the building is is
 
00:42:53.690 --> 00:42:53.700 align:start position:0%
built to with built and designed to um
 
00:42:56.089 --> 00:42:56.099 align:start position:0%
accommodate the potential for a flood a
 
00:42:58.190 --> 00:42:58.200 align:start position:0%
flooded basement such as your mechanical
 
00:42:59.510 --> 00:42:59.520 align:start position:0%
equipment your electrical equipment
 
00:43:02.210 --> 00:43:02.220 align:start position:0%
would be somewhere in your house above
 
00:43:04.670 --> 00:43:04.680 align:start position:0%
flood stage but you could still build
 
00:43:07.130 --> 00:43:07.140 align:start position:0%
there uh prior codes did not recognize
 
00:43:09.050 --> 00:43:09.060 align:start position:0%
that and you could actually put all of
 
00:43:10.670 --> 00:43:10.680 align:start position:0%
your systems in the basement where they
 
00:43:14.510 --> 00:43:14.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:17.150 --> 00:43:17.160 align:start position:0%
representative Walsh thank you Mr chair
 
00:43:19.190 --> 00:43:19.200 align:start position:0%
and if you're going to be working with
 
00:43:22.370 --> 00:43:22.380 align:start position:0%
Mr Frost and and representative Wallace
 
00:43:23.990 --> 00:43:24.000 align:start position:0%
I'll ask the question would you be
 
00:43:27.530 --> 00:43:27.540 align:start position:0%
opposed to I think a shorter period
 
00:43:30.290 --> 00:43:30.300 align:start position:0%
of grandfathering of codes
 
00:43:33.170 --> 00:43:33.180 align:start position:0%
then say your example of a subdivision
 
00:43:35.150 --> 00:43:35.160 align:start position:0%
from seven years ago and and I ask you
 
00:43:36.410 --> 00:43:36.420 align:start position:0%
this and I'll give you an example why
 
00:43:37.790 --> 00:43:37.800 align:start position:0%
because this just happened to me
 
00:43:41.030 --> 00:43:41.040 align:start position:0%
recently a couple of constituents in my
 
00:43:43.490 --> 00:43:43.500 align:start position:0%
town built their houses based on the
 
00:43:45.190 --> 00:43:45.200 align:start position:0%
approved plan
 
00:43:48.490 --> 00:43:48.500 align:start position:0%
subdivision with a 14-foot driveway
 
00:43:50.870 --> 00:43:50.880 align:start position:0%
under right at the time we were
 
00:43:55.430 --> 00:43:55.440 align:start position:0%
operating under NFPA one 2015
 
00:43:57.950 --> 00:43:57.960 align:start position:0%
um and section 18 which deals with fire
 
00:43:59.450 --> 00:43:59.460 align:start position:0%
access roads did not mention anything
 
00:44:02.089 --> 00:44:02.099 align:start position:0%
about residential driveways
 
00:44:04.849 --> 00:44:04.859 align:start position:0%
it was only a year's time these people
 
00:44:06.470 --> 00:44:06.480 align:start position:0%
finished their houses based on the
 
00:44:08.569 --> 00:44:08.579 align:start position:0%
approved plans and the approved
 
00:44:11.510 --> 00:44:11.520 align:start position:0%
ordinance built their driveways to spec
 
00:44:15.250 --> 00:44:15.260 align:start position:0%
including all of their their uh uh
 
00:44:18.349 --> 00:44:18.359 align:start position:0%
Wetlands Crossing and Des applications
 
00:44:21.290 --> 00:44:21.300 align:start position:0%
and then a time of Co when they had no
 
00:44:22.370 --> 00:44:22.380 align:start position:0%
more money left and the construction
 
00:44:25.609 --> 00:44:25.619 align:start position:0%
loan was paid for or or done extended
 
00:44:27.770 --> 00:44:27.780 align:start position:0%
the fire department said he wanted a
 
00:44:29.990 --> 00:44:30.000 align:start position:0%
20-foot driveway instead of the 14 that
 
00:44:31.309 --> 00:44:31.319 align:start position:0%
was by plan
 
00:44:33.589 --> 00:44:33.599 align:start position:0%
so this is the type of thing that we
 
00:44:35.329 --> 00:44:35.339 align:start position:0%
heard from a lot of developers that goes
 
00:44:37.670 --> 00:44:37.680 align:start position:0%
on more often than you think so would
 
00:44:39.710 --> 00:44:39.720 align:start position:0%
you be opposed to maybe a shorter
 
00:44:41.690 --> 00:44:41.700 align:start position:0%
duration I mean that wasn't fair I think
 
00:44:43.490 --> 00:44:43.500 align:start position:0%
I got to solved legislatively this year
 
00:44:50.930 --> 00:44:50.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:53.150 --> 00:44:53.160 align:start position:0%
can't speak for you know everyone in our
 
00:44:55.250 --> 00:44:55.260 align:start position:0%
association I can speak for that you
 
00:44:57.710 --> 00:44:57.720 align:start position:0%
know we're always open to negotiation
 
00:45:00.170 --> 00:45:00.180 align:start position:0%
and compromise where we can find Common
 
00:45:00.180 --> 00:45:01.550 align:start position:0%
and compromise where we can find Common
Ground

00:45:01.550 --> 00:45:01.560 align:start position:0%
Ground
 
00:45:03.109 --> 00:45:03.119 align:start position:0%
um you know as I've also been told you
 
00:45:04.609 --> 00:45:04.619 align:start position:0%
on the best negotiation is that
 
00:45:05.870 --> 00:45:05.880 align:start position:0%
everybody walks away from the table
 
00:45:05.880 --> 00:45:07.490 align:start position:0%
everybody walks away from the table
unhappy

00:45:07.490 --> 00:45:07.500 align:start position:0%
unhappy
 
00:45:10.250 --> 00:45:10.260 align:start position:0%
um and so I absolutely we could look at
 
00:45:12.710 --> 00:45:12.720 align:start position:0%
that and and consider a shorter time
 
00:45:15.410 --> 00:45:15.420 align:start position:0%
frame I'd also
 
00:45:15.420 --> 00:45:18.530 align:start position:0%
frame I'd also
question

00:45:18.530 --> 00:45:18.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:21.829 --> 00:45:21.839 align:start position:0%
when a developer is
 
00:45:23.630 --> 00:45:23.640 align:start position:0%
given that
 
00:45:26.390 --> 00:45:26.400 align:start position:0%
type of situation is an appeals process
 
00:45:28.609 --> 00:45:28.619 align:start position:0%
that they can go through they can appeal
 
00:45:30.770 --> 00:45:30.780 align:start position:0%
the code official they can appeal to the
 
00:45:33.730 --> 00:45:33.740 align:start position:0%
local they can also appeal to the state
 
00:45:38.089 --> 00:45:38.099 align:start position:0%
and and I find often that developers are
 
00:45:39.890 --> 00:45:39.900 align:start position:0%
leery of doing so because they don't
 
00:45:42.109 --> 00:45:42.119 align:start position:0%
want to create a
 
00:45:45.349 --> 00:45:45.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:48.230 --> 00:45:48.240 align:start position:0%
So when you say appeal to the state that
 
00:45:50.270 --> 00:45:50.280 align:start position:0%
would be the courts
 
00:45:52.790 --> 00:45:52.800 align:start position:0%
or is it is it is there a board
 
00:45:55.849 --> 00:45:55.859 align:start position:0%
that you have yes there's a current the
 
00:45:57.890 --> 00:45:57.900 align:start position:0%
current process that was adopted uh I
 
00:45:57.900 --> 00:45:58.670 align:start position:0%
current process that was adopted uh I
believe

00:45:58.670 --> 00:45:58.680 align:start position:0%
believe
 
00:46:01.490 --> 00:46:01.500 align:start position:0%
um two years ago two or three years ago
 
00:46:04.069 --> 00:46:04.079 align:start position:0%
is you have a local appeals board which
 
00:46:06.290 --> 00:46:06.300 align:start position:0%
which will address anything locally and
 
00:46:07.970 --> 00:46:07.980 align:start position:0%
if you still feel aggrieved by the local
 
00:46:09.710 --> 00:46:09.720 align:start position:0%
community you can appeal to the State
 
00:46:11.450 --> 00:46:11.460 align:start position:0%
Building Code review board which which
 
00:46:15.109 --> 00:46:15.119 align:start position:0%
is a 17 person 17 member Board of
 
00:46:16.490 --> 00:46:16.500 align:start position:0%
various disciplines in the construction
 
00:46:19.510 --> 00:46:19.520 align:start position:0%
industry engineering
 
00:46:23.030 --> 00:46:23.040 align:start position:0%
land use codes that
 
00:46:25.730 --> 00:46:25.740 align:start position:0%
that is what they do they just they eat
 
00:46:28.069 --> 00:46:28.079 align:start position:0%
and sleep codes but they are absolutely
 
00:46:29.630 --> 00:46:29.640 align:start position:0%
an appeal board you could bring a case
 
00:46:31.790 --> 00:46:31.800 align:start position:0%
like that too for their determination of
 
00:46:36.349 --> 00:46:36.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:38.930 --> 00:46:38.940 align:start position:0%
code was presented right whether whether
 
00:46:42.410 --> 00:46:42.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:45.050 --> 00:46:45.060 align:start position:0%
uh used correctly in that in that
 
00:46:47.750 --> 00:46:47.760 align:start position:0%
certain instance
 
00:46:47.760 --> 00:46:49.190 align:start position:0%
certain instance
good

00:46:49.190 --> 00:46:49.200 align:start position:0%
good
 
00:46:50.930 --> 00:46:50.940 align:start position:0%
I'm having a hard time putting it to a
 
00:46:50.940 --> 00:46:52.010 align:start position:0%
I'm having a hard time putting it to a
question

00:46:52.010 --> 00:46:52.020 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:46:53.690 --> 00:46:53.700 align:start position:0%
would you believe that when somebody has
 
00:46:55.430 --> 00:46:55.440 align:start position:0%
to close on their construction loan they
 
00:46:57.230 --> 00:46:57.240 align:start position:0%
don't have a time to go to an appeals
 
00:46:57.240 --> 00:47:01.309 align:start position:0%
don't have a time to go to an appeals
board

00:47:01.309 --> 00:47:01.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:04.670 --> 00:47:04.680 align:start position:0%
I can appreciate that
 
00:47:10.370 --> 00:47:10.380 align:start position:0%
representative Cullen thank you I I do
 
00:47:13.990 --> 00:47:14.000 align:start position:0%
um kind of agree with the sentiment that
 
00:47:16.910 --> 00:47:16.920 align:start position:0%
that the
 
00:47:20.210 --> 00:47:20.220 align:start position:0%
my main concern at least with this type
 
00:47:23.630 --> 00:47:23.640 align:start position:0%
of legislation is the
 
00:47:28.010 --> 00:47:28.020 align:start position:0%
um the local municipalities making
 
00:47:31.550 --> 00:47:31.560 align:start position:0%
um rule changes that make
 
00:47:35.530 --> 00:47:35.540 align:start position:0%
um previously approved Lots
 
00:47:38.750 --> 00:47:38.760 align:start position:0%
non-conforming and having them have
 
00:47:38.760 --> 00:47:41.210 align:start position:0%
non-conforming and having them have
additional

00:47:41.210 --> 00:47:41.220 align:start position:0%
additional
 
00:47:43.210 --> 00:47:43.220 align:start position:0%
um barriers
 
00:47:46.010 --> 00:47:46.020 align:start position:0%
having to go seek relief for from the
 
00:47:49.430 --> 00:47:49.440 align:start position:0%
zba and stuff like that for
 
00:47:49.440 --> 00:47:51.589 align:start position:0%
zba and stuff like that for
building

00:47:51.589 --> 00:47:51.599 align:start position:0%
building
 
00:47:53.569 --> 00:47:53.579 align:start position:0%
um an addition or whatever the case may
 
00:47:57.230 --> 00:47:57.240 align:start position:0%
be that a a lot that is right next door
 
00:48:01.670 --> 00:48:01.680 align:start position:0%
doesn't have because they they are
 
00:48:01.680 --> 00:48:03.470 align:start position:0%
doesn't have because they they are
conforming

00:48:03.470 --> 00:48:03.480 align:start position:0%
conforming
 
00:48:05.630 --> 00:48:05.640 align:start position:0%
there's no other difference
 
00:48:08.290 --> 00:48:08.300 align:start position:0%
um and I think that
 
00:48:12.770 --> 00:48:12.780 align:start position:0%
that we in New Hampshire have have a lot
 
00:48:15.130 --> 00:48:15.140 align:start position:0%
of properties that are now
 
00:48:17.270 --> 00:48:17.280 align:start position:0%
non-conforming which were completely
 
00:48:19.490 --> 00:48:19.500 align:start position:0%
legitimately formed
 
00:48:21.950 --> 00:48:21.960 align:start position:0%
um to the conforming uh to the the
 
00:48:25.309 --> 00:48:25.319 align:start position:0%
standards as they were at the time
 
00:48:25.319 --> 00:48:26.089 align:start position:0%
standards as they were at the time
um

00:48:26.089 --> 00:48:26.099 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:48:30.230 --> 00:48:30.240 align:start position:0%
of creation and so I think that you know
 
00:48:33.230 --> 00:48:33.240 align:start position:0%
whether or not we we grandfather
 
00:48:36.530 --> 00:48:36.540 align:start position:0%
additional building codes that I don't
 
00:48:40.910 --> 00:48:40.920 align:start position:0%
think that is the main focus of my
 
00:48:40.920 --> 00:48:42.650 align:start position:0%
think that is the main focus of my
um concern

00:48:42.650 --> 00:48:42.660 align:start position:0%
um concern
 
00:48:46.430 --> 00:48:46.440 align:start position:0%
um you know I being on a zba and having
 
00:48:49.910 --> 00:48:49.920 align:start position:0%
someone have to come in for a shed being
 
00:48:52.730 --> 00:48:52.740 align:start position:0%
placed you know 15 feet from the from
 
00:48:56.450 --> 00:48:56.460 align:start position:0%
the property line
 
00:48:58.910 --> 00:48:58.920 align:start position:0%
um when every other
 
00:49:01.250 --> 00:49:01.260 align:start position:0%
house on the street has a shed 15 feet
 
00:49:03.650 --> 00:49:03.660 align:start position:0%
from the property line and so it just
 
00:49:06.710 --> 00:49:06.720 align:start position:0%
doesn't make any sense why they are
 
00:49:09.710 --> 00:49:09.720 align:start position:0%
singled out because they they're you
 
00:49:09.720 --> 00:49:10.370 align:start position:0%
singled out because they they're you
know

00:49:10.370 --> 00:49:10.380 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:49:12.530 --> 00:49:12.540 align:start position:0%
they're non-conforming and they have to
 
00:49:15.829 --> 00:49:15.839 align:start position:0%
go and pay you know the zba fees and the
 
00:49:17.750 --> 00:49:17.760 align:start position:0%
notification fees and all of that stuff
 
00:49:21.170 --> 00:49:21.180 align:start position:0%
is just a barrier unnecessary created by
 
00:49:22.510 --> 00:49:22.520 align:start position:0%
the the
 
00:49:25.370 --> 00:49:25.380 align:start position:0%
municipality I think unjustly and so
 
00:49:27.770 --> 00:49:27.780 align:start position:0%
that's mostly what I'm trying to or
 
00:49:29.750 --> 00:49:29.760 align:start position:0%
mostly I'm concerned about
 
00:49:31.490 --> 00:49:31.500 align:start position:0%
from my perspective was that a question
 
00:49:33.589 --> 00:49:33.599 align:start position:0%
for Bill or is
 
00:49:33.599 --> 00:49:34.270 align:start position:0%
for Bill or is
um

00:49:34.270 --> 00:49:34.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:49:38.270 --> 00:49:38.280 align:start position:0%
I mean I'm just uh yeah I guess I don't
 
00:49:40.130 --> 00:49:40.140 align:start position:0%
I don't really have a question I think I
 
00:49:44.450 --> 00:49:44.460 align:start position:0%
am agreeing a little bit with the the
 
00:49:47.030 --> 00:49:47.040 align:start position:0%
sentiment that maybe it isn't the
 
00:49:52.089 --> 00:49:52.099 align:start position:0%
building code that that is the like the
 
00:49:55.190 --> 00:49:55.200 align:start position:0%
the focus or shouldn't be necessarily
 
00:49:59.569 --> 00:49:59.579 align:start position:0%
the focus of this I do I guess have a
 
00:50:02.390 --> 00:50:02.400 align:start position:0%
question about the the example that
 
00:50:06.770 --> 00:50:06.780 align:start position:0%
representative Walsh made about the
 
00:50:10.190 --> 00:50:10.200 align:start position:0%
um Fire official if the code review
 
00:50:12.950 --> 00:50:12.960 align:start position:0%
board is the
 
00:50:17.450 --> 00:50:17.460 align:start position:0%
would be able to accept uh an appeal of
 
00:50:20.030 --> 00:50:20.040 align:start position:0%
a fire official's decision
 
00:50:20.040 --> 00:50:21.050 align:start position:0%
a fire official's decision
um because

00:50:21.050 --> 00:50:21.060 align:start position:0%
um because
 
00:50:25.730 --> 00:50:25.740 align:start position:0%
are they really a code review or is it
 
00:50:31.069 --> 00:50:31.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:32.990 --> 00:50:33.000 align:start position:0%
yes the building code review board has
 
00:50:35.870 --> 00:50:35.880 align:start position:0%
the has has the authority to hear
 
00:50:37.849 --> 00:50:37.859 align:start position:0%
appeals of the building and fire codes
 
00:50:39.589 --> 00:50:39.599 align:start position:0%
for the State of New Hampshire
 
00:50:42.290 --> 00:50:42.300 align:start position:0%
and the authority to override
 
00:50:44.750 --> 00:50:44.760 align:start position:0%
to make a determination of whether the
 
00:50:47.329 --> 00:50:47.339 align:start position:0%
code was correctly applied or not okay
 
00:50:50.390 --> 00:50:50.400 align:start position:0%
they can't they can't Grant waivers to
 
00:50:52.250 --> 00:50:52.260 align:start position:0%
code but what they can do is make a
 
00:50:53.450 --> 00:50:53.460 align:start position:0%
determination of whether the code
 
00:50:56.329 --> 00:50:56.339 align:start position:0%
official you know apply the code
 
00:50:58.730 --> 00:50:58.740 align:start position:0%
correctly in that instance
 
00:51:00.890 --> 00:51:00.900 align:start position:0%
so so there yeah what would be the
 
00:51:03.589 --> 00:51:03.599 align:start position:0%
consequence of a ruling
 
00:51:06.410 --> 00:51:06.420 align:start position:0%
if it was incorrect as determined by the
 
00:51:10.030 --> 00:51:10.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:13.069 --> 00:51:13.079 align:start position:0%
would the decision be reversed yes the
 
00:51:14.809 --> 00:51:14.819 align:start position:0%
decision would would be recommended to
 
00:51:16.790 --> 00:51:16.800 align:start position:0%
be reversed recommended or would it be
 
00:51:18.829 --> 00:51:18.839 align:start position:0%
reversed I I'll be honest with you I
 
00:51:20.870 --> 00:51:20.880 align:start position:0%
don't serve on the building code uh
 
00:51:22.910 --> 00:51:22.920 align:start position:0%
review board I don't know their exact
 
00:51:25.150 --> 00:51:25.160 align:start position:0%
Authority you know authority over
 
00:51:27.970 --> 00:51:27.980 align:start position:0%
governing what
 
00:51:30.829 --> 00:51:30.839 align:start position:0%
I only ask because I also have a piece
 
00:51:32.450 --> 00:51:32.460 align:start position:0%
of legislation that would direct a lot
 
00:51:33.650 --> 00:51:33.660 align:start position:0%
of these appeals to go to the housing
 
00:51:34.910 --> 00:51:34.920 align:start position:0%
appeals board which does have the
 
00:51:37.849 --> 00:51:37.859 align:start position:0%
authority so I guess my question is
 
00:51:40.430 --> 00:51:40.440 align:start position:0%
does your board have the authority to do
 
00:51:42.829 --> 00:51:42.839 align:start position:0%
this already and have the teeth behind
 
00:51:45.589 --> 00:51:45.599 align:start position:0%
it to override these decisions or or not
 
00:51:51.670 --> 00:51:51.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:53.990 --> 00:51:54.000 align:start position:0%
I do ever representative building code
 
00:52:01.730 --> 00:52:01.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:04.069 --> 00:52:04.079 align:start position:0%
good morning uh Phil Sherman the chair
 
00:52:05.150 --> 00:52:05.160 align:start position:0%
of the building code review board
 
00:52:06.530 --> 00:52:06.540 align:start position:0%
couldn't make it today so I'm a
 
00:52:08.750 --> 00:52:08.760 align:start position:0%
representative uh Michael Hagen I sit on
 
00:52:10.609 --> 00:52:10.619 align:start position:0%
the building code review board
 
00:52:10.619 --> 00:52:11.990 align:start position:0%
the building code review board
um

00:52:11.990 --> 00:52:12.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:15.230 --> 00:52:15.240 align:start position:0%
I guess to answer your question uh it is
 
00:52:18.890 --> 00:52:18.900 align:start position:0%
a um uh it is an official ruling it is a
 
00:52:18.900 --> 00:52:20.210 align:start position:0%
a um uh it is an official ruling it is a
uh

00:52:20.210 --> 00:52:20.220 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:52:24.410 --> 00:52:24.420 align:start position:0%
um there it is overseen almost as a um I
 
00:52:26.809 --> 00:52:26.819 align:start position:0%
I don't want to quote this wrong but it
 
00:52:30.890 --> 00:52:30.900 align:start position:0%
does have the authority to as a decision
 
00:52:34.430 --> 00:52:34.440 align:start position:0%
um that uh I don't want to say
 
00:52:34.440 --> 00:52:36.650 align:start position:0%
um that uh I don't want to say
um

00:52:36.650 --> 00:52:36.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:37.970 --> 00:52:37.980 align:start position:0%
I know I'm going to get the wording
 
00:52:39.470 --> 00:52:39.480 align:start position:0%
wrong so I'm not going to say it but it
 
00:52:41.329 --> 00:52:41.339 align:start position:0%
does have the authority that that is the
 
00:52:43.849 --> 00:52:43.859 align:start position:0%
final decision now the process the next
 
00:52:45.470 --> 00:52:45.480 align:start position:0%
process would be they can appeal to
 
00:52:48.170 --> 00:52:48.180 align:start position:0%
Superior Court if they don't agree with
 
00:52:51.290 --> 00:52:51.300 align:start position:0%
it either in favor of the developer for
 
00:52:53.750 --> 00:52:53.760 align:start position:0%
their question or the municipality they
 
00:52:55.790 --> 00:52:55.800 align:start position:0%
could appeal it to Superior or vice
 
00:52:58.190 --> 00:52:58.200 align:start position:0%
versa so there is that last step that
 
00:52:59.809 --> 00:52:59.819 align:start position:0%
doesn't take away the authority to still
 
00:53:02.329 --> 00:53:02.339 align:start position:0%
bring it to Superior Court
 
00:53:04.190 --> 00:53:04.200 align:start position:0%
if they want to appeal that this that
 
00:53:07.430 --> 00:53:07.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:09.290 --> 00:53:09.300 align:start position:0%
I'm okay
 
00:53:13.130 --> 00:53:13.140 align:start position:0%
representative thank you do you have
 
00:53:16.250 --> 00:53:16.260 align:start position:0%
um do you have jurisdiction over
 
00:53:16.260 --> 00:53:16.970 align:start position:0%
um do you have jurisdiction over
um

00:53:16.970 --> 00:53:16.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:20.630 --> 00:53:20.640 align:start position:0%
only local uh municipality decisions or
 
00:53:24.170 --> 00:53:24.180 align:start position:0%
whatever what if the Des or or the State
 
00:53:26.150 --> 00:53:26.160 align:start position:0%
Fire Marshal made a decision would you
 
00:53:28.309 --> 00:53:28.319 align:start position:0%
be able to appeal those same things to
 
00:53:31.069 --> 00:53:31.079 align:start position:0%
your board and you could overrule those
 
00:53:33.890 --> 00:53:33.900 align:start position:0%
those ones also only pertaining to the
 
00:53:36.530 --> 00:53:36.540 align:start position:0%
State Building Code and fire code so the
 
00:53:38.809 --> 00:53:38.819 align:start position:0%
the example I'm sorry the example that
 
00:53:40.010 --> 00:53:40.020 align:start position:0%
representative Walsh said with the
 
00:53:41.329 --> 00:53:41.339 align:start position:0%
driveway that would be something that
 
00:53:43.309 --> 00:53:43.319 align:start position:0%
your board would deal with so first
 
00:53:45.290 --> 00:53:45.300 align:start position:0%
appeal for that would be they would
 
00:53:47.930 --> 00:53:47.940 align:start position:0%
appeal it or ask for either a waiver or
 
00:53:49.490 --> 00:53:49.500 align:start position:0%
variance from the State Farm Marshal
 
00:53:51.290 --> 00:53:51.300 align:start position:0%
because they can give waivers and
 
00:53:53.809 --> 00:53:53.819 align:start position:0%
variances to the state fire code that
 
00:53:56.390 --> 00:53:56.400 align:start position:0%
would be your first process if they
 
00:53:58.190 --> 00:53:58.200 align:start position:0%
don't agree with it then it would be
 
00:54:01.549 --> 00:54:01.559 align:start position:0%
then the state if they don't agree with
 
00:54:02.630 --> 00:54:02.640 align:start position:0%
that decision it would come to the
 
00:54:05.150 --> 00:54:05.160 align:start position:0%
building code review board um
 
00:54:07.730 --> 00:54:07.740 align:start position:0%
after that process
 
00:54:07.740 --> 00:54:09.170 align:start position:0%
after that process
okay

00:54:09.170 --> 00:54:09.180 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:54:10.790 --> 00:54:10.800 align:start position:0%
um does anyone else have questions
 
00:54:12.349 --> 00:54:12.359 align:start position:0%
representative birdie
 
00:54:14.690 --> 00:54:14.700 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
00:54:18.049 --> 00:54:18.059 align:start position:0%
um in the case of the driveway when a
 
00:54:20.930 --> 00:54:20.940 align:start position:0%
plan is approved whether it's a subsidy
 
00:54:22.190 --> 00:54:22.200 align:start position:0%
it's a subdivision it's going to be
 
00:54:26.150 --> 00:54:26.160 align:start position:0%
approved by the town and they consider a
 
00:54:28.130 --> 00:54:28.140 align:start position:0%
lot of things the construction of the
 
00:54:30.970 --> 00:54:30.980 align:start position:0%
house all the codes in the house
 
00:54:32.990 --> 00:54:33.000 align:start position:0%
the roads
 
00:54:35.270 --> 00:54:35.280 align:start position:0%
turnarounds for fire engines and all
 
00:54:38.329 --> 00:54:38.339 align:start position:0%
that why wouldn't the driveway be potted
 
00:54:40.069 --> 00:54:40.079 align:start position:0%
a permitting process
 
00:54:43.549 --> 00:54:43.559 align:start position:0%
when you have a plot plan with a house
 
00:54:46.069 --> 00:54:46.079 align:start position:0%
everything is approved why isn't the
 
00:54:47.930 --> 00:54:47.940 align:start position:0%
driveway approved at the same time and
 
00:54:50.569 --> 00:54:50.579 align:start position:0%
why doesn't the fire department sign off
 
00:54:52.549 --> 00:54:52.559 align:start position:0%
on that plan
 
00:54:54.589 --> 00:54:54.599 align:start position:0%
I think I go ahead and represent Wall
 
00:54:54.599 --> 00:54:55.430 align:start position:0%
I think I go ahead and represent Wall
Street

00:54:55.430 --> 00:54:55.440 align:start position:0%
Street
 
00:54:57.230 --> 00:54:57.240 align:start position:0%
well they were first of all the
 
00:54:59.569 --> 00:54:59.579 align:start position:0%
subdivision in question did go through a
 
00:55:02.150 --> 00:55:02.160 align:start position:0%
technical Review Committee it was also
 
00:55:03.890 --> 00:55:03.900 align:start position:0%
reviewed by our engineer with the
 
00:55:05.569 --> 00:55:05.579 align:start position:0%
driveways on it that it complied with
 
00:55:07.670 --> 00:55:07.680 align:start position:0%
our ordinance that's what the shocking
 
00:55:09.170 --> 00:55:09.180 align:start position:0%
part about it was when the ordinance
 
00:55:11.690 --> 00:55:11.700 align:start position:0%
says 14 feet and then the Marshall comes
 
00:55:13.609 --> 00:55:13.619 align:start position:0%
in at time of sending the chief comes in
 
00:55:16.370 --> 00:55:16.380 align:start position:0%
at Co time and says no I decided I want
 
00:55:18.829 --> 00:55:18.839 align:start position:0%
20. that's what started all this and
 
00:55:20.089 --> 00:55:20.099 align:start position:0%
that's the type of thing that people
 
00:55:22.430 --> 00:55:22.440 align:start position:0%
don't deserve to have and hopefully we
 
00:55:24.109 --> 00:55:24.119 align:start position:0%
can find some language that stops IT in
 
00:55:25.010 --> 00:55:25.020 align:start position:0%
the future
 
00:55:28.130 --> 00:55:28.140 align:start position:0%
okay but to alleviate the problem you
 
00:55:29.750 --> 00:55:29.760 align:start position:0%
think the fire department should sign
 
00:55:32.690 --> 00:55:32.700 align:start position:0%
off on a plan before it's built
 
00:55:35.270 --> 00:55:35.280 align:start position:0%
they do yeah
 
00:55:37.309 --> 00:55:37.319 align:start position:0%
so that shouldn't have that well they
 
00:55:39.470 --> 00:55:39.480 align:start position:0%
are given the opportunity but in this
 
00:55:40.849 --> 00:55:40.859 align:start position:0%
particular case I guess they didn't
 
00:55:42.290 --> 00:55:42.300 align:start position:0%
attend the Tia technical Review
 
00:55:45.349 --> 00:55:45.359 align:start position:0%
Committee so they had a window to chime
 
00:55:47.750 --> 00:55:47.760 align:start position:0%
in they did not chime in because they
 
00:55:49.190 --> 00:55:49.200 align:start position:0%
didn't it went through the rest of the
 
00:55:51.650 --> 00:55:51.660 align:start position:0%
process as they always do and then at
 
00:55:53.329 --> 00:55:53.339 align:start position:0%
the end of the day he came back and said
 
00:55:55.670 --> 00:55:55.680 align:start position:0%
no I want six feet wider which would
 
00:55:57.890 --> 00:55:57.900 align:start position:0%
have required more culverts more DDS
 
00:56:00.710 --> 00:56:00.720 align:start position:0%
permits etc etc and to be honest with
 
00:56:05.030 --> 00:56:05.040 align:start position:0%
you the the NFPA won 2018 was just got
 
00:56:07.250 --> 00:56:07.260 align:start position:0%
adopted hadn't been adopted yet but he
 
00:56:08.930 --> 00:56:08.940 align:start position:0%
knew it was coming that's why he decided
 
00:56:12.049 --> 00:56:12.059 align:start position:0%
to expand his interpretation of what the
 
00:56:14.329 --> 00:56:14.339 align:start position:0%
fire access road was and apply it to
 
00:56:17.030 --> 00:56:17.040 align:start position:0%
driveways for residential purposes so
 
00:56:19.130 --> 00:56:19.140 align:start position:0%
this is that is precisely what this this
 
00:56:21.170 --> 00:56:21.180 align:start position:0%
language is trying to do so I I'm really
 
00:56:22.970 --> 00:56:22.980 align:start position:0%
hoping that we can get air to address
 
00:56:24.230 --> 00:56:24.240 align:start position:0%
something like that thank you very much
 
00:56:26.630 --> 00:56:26.640 align:start position:0%
for your Insight
 
00:56:28.490 --> 00:56:28.500 align:start position:0%
all right is there anything else on this
 
00:56:31.430 --> 00:56:31.440 align:start position:0%
so representative what about just
 
00:56:31.440 --> 00:56:32.770 align:start position:0%
so representative what about just
forbidding

00:56:32.770 --> 00:56:32.780 align:start position:0%
forbidding
 
00:56:35.990 --> 00:56:36.000 align:start position:0%
requiring things that are greater than
 
00:56:39.470 --> 00:56:39.480 align:start position:0%
them than the code if you're if you're
 
00:56:42.049 --> 00:56:42.059 align:start position:0%
are or the greater than what is what is
 
00:56:45.349 --> 00:56:45.359 align:start position:0%
currently in statute if you're or in the
 
00:56:50.270 --> 00:56:50.280 align:start position:0%
zoning ordinance right the the adopted
 
00:56:50.280 --> 00:56:52.210 align:start position:0%
zoning ordinance right the the adopted
um

00:56:52.210 --> 00:56:52.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:56:56.450 --> 00:56:56.460 align:start position:0%
width of the driveway was approved and
 
00:56:59.930 --> 00:56:59.940 align:start position:0%
allowed and if a if
 
00:57:03.290 --> 00:57:03.300 align:start position:0%
official comes in and says I want more
 
00:57:04.250 --> 00:57:04.260 align:start position:0%
than that
 
00:57:07.370 --> 00:57:07.380 align:start position:0%
then that is not within his authority to
 
00:57:10.609 --> 00:57:10.619 align:start position:0%
do is my opinion and so why couldn't we
 
00:57:13.910 --> 00:57:13.920 align:start position:0%
just disallow that action if it's
 
00:57:15.650 --> 00:57:15.660 align:start position:0%
already not disallowed because I think
 
00:57:17.089 --> 00:57:17.099 align:start position:0%
it should be I think the code was
 
00:57:18.650 --> 00:57:18.660 align:start position:0%
changed I think in this situation it was
 
00:57:20.450 --> 00:57:20.460 align:start position:0%
changed right representative Walsh in
 
00:57:22.549 --> 00:57:22.559 align:start position:0%
between I didn't get a law pass and
 
00:57:24.170 --> 00:57:24.180 align:start position:0%
signed by the governor to address the
 
00:57:27.170 --> 00:57:27.180 align:start position:0%
specific issue but that that's that
 
00:57:29.270 --> 00:57:29.280 align:start position:0%
whole concept could happen with a lot of
 
00:57:32.569 --> 00:57:32.579 align:start position:0%
other codes okay
 
00:57:34.970 --> 00:57:34.980 align:start position:0%
great so um representative Wallace you
 
00:57:36.950 --> 00:57:36.960 align:start position:0%
are going to consult with yes our
 
00:57:38.450 --> 00:57:38.460 align:start position:0%
friends in the room and make sure we can
 
00:57:40.490 --> 00:57:40.500 align:start position:0%
get some language here on this
 
00:57:40.500 --> 00:57:41.690 align:start position:0%
get some language here on this
okay

00:57:41.690 --> 00:57:41.700 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:57:42.950 --> 00:57:42.960 align:start position:0%
um the next one I want to move on to
 
00:57:44.750 --> 00:57:44.760 align:start position:0%
while we're here because I brought it up
 
00:57:47.630 --> 00:57:47.640 align:start position:0%
is the language that I have that would
 
00:57:50.510 --> 00:57:50.520 align:start position:0%
amend the RSA around the housing appeals
 
00:57:53.270 --> 00:57:53.280 align:start position:0%
board so there is um I pass around
 
00:57:56.390 --> 00:57:56.400 align:start position:0%
language to the committee there is
 
00:57:59.690 --> 00:57:59.700 align:start position:0%
um extras on the table out back but to
 
00:58:02.510 --> 00:58:02.520 align:start position:0%
present this this is I believe
 
00:58:05.750 --> 00:58:05.760 align:start position:0%
a small expansion that addresses
 
00:58:07.490 --> 00:58:07.500 align:start position:0%
um problems relating to private property
 
00:58:07.500 --> 00:58:09.829 align:start position:0%
um problems relating to private property
rights

00:58:09.829 --> 00:58:09.839 align:start position:0%
rights
 
00:58:12.589 --> 00:58:12.599 align:start position:0%
it adds one sentence that said that
 
00:58:14.270 --> 00:58:14.280 align:start position:0%
gives jurisdiction to the housing
 
00:58:16.609 --> 00:58:16.619 align:start position:0%
appeals board to address appeals related
 
00:58:18.290 --> 00:58:18.300 align:start position:0%
to State issue permanent or licenses
 
00:58:20.329 --> 00:58:20.339 align:start position:0%
related to housing and Housing
 
00:58:24.650 --> 00:58:24.660 align:start position:0%
Development only so this goes to part of
 
00:58:26.030 --> 00:58:26.040 align:start position:0%
what we talked about with building code
 
00:58:29.809 --> 00:58:29.819 align:start position:0%
but it expands it to rulings made by do
 
00:58:31.730 --> 00:58:31.740 align:start position:0%
you need one
 
00:58:36.650 --> 00:58:36.660 align:start position:0%
this is the one about Amanda RSA 679 by
 
00:58:40.910 --> 00:58:40.920 align:start position:0%
so this goes to any rulings from uh or
 
00:58:43.569 --> 00:58:43.579 align:start position:0%
any rules from Des
 
00:58:46.190 --> 00:58:46.200 align:start position:0%
State Fire Marshal's Office anything
 
00:58:46.200 --> 00:58:47.510 align:start position:0%
State Fire Marshal's Office anything
that

00:58:47.510 --> 00:58:47.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:58:50.870 --> 00:58:50.880 align:start position:0%
um could hinder development it could be
 
00:58:53.030 --> 00:58:53.040 align:start position:0%
appealed through this board
 
00:58:55.250 --> 00:58:55.260 align:start position:0%
um so with that I love the committee's
 
00:58:57.230 --> 00:58:57.240 align:start position:0%
feedback on this and and see where
 
00:59:01.510 --> 00:59:01.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:03.170 --> 00:59:03.180 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:59:06.950 --> 00:59:06.960 align:start position:0%
um I I think that it's
 
00:59:06.960 --> 00:59:08.390 align:start position:0%
um I I think that it's
good

00:59:08.390 --> 00:59:08.400 align:start position:0%
good
 
00:59:11.390 --> 00:59:11.400 align:start position:0%
um I also just kind of Wonder
 
00:59:14.210 --> 00:59:14.220 align:start position:0%
um about if this
 
00:59:17.329 --> 00:59:17.339 align:start position:0%
we just heard about the the
 
00:59:19.490 --> 00:59:19.500 align:start position:0%
um code review board and I'm just
 
00:59:22.430 --> 00:59:22.440 align:start position:0%
wondering about if this has a similar
 
00:59:25.910 --> 00:59:25.920 align:start position:0%
type of time frame as far as like wood
 
00:59:29.809 --> 00:59:29.819 align:start position:0%
wood people if this change happened if
 
00:59:33.530 --> 00:59:33.540 align:start position:0%
this this board has a tighter window of
 
00:59:35.510 --> 00:59:35.520 align:start position:0%
of making decisions and stuff like that
 
00:59:35.520 --> 00:59:36.950 align:start position:0%
of making decisions and stuff like that
maybe

00:59:36.950 --> 00:59:36.960 align:start position:0%
maybe
 
00:59:38.930 --> 00:59:38.940 align:start position:0%
um people end up going to this way
 
00:59:41.750 --> 00:59:41.760 align:start position:0%
instead of the review board if it would
 
00:59:45.049 --> 00:59:45.059 align:start position:0%
result in a faster decision
 
00:59:47.870 --> 00:59:47.880 align:start position:0%
um but I also think that you know there
 
00:59:50.870 --> 00:59:50.880 align:start position:0%
are things that may not come under the
 
00:59:53.210 --> 00:59:53.220 align:start position:0%
specifically under the code language
 
00:59:57.950 --> 00:59:57.960 align:start position:0%
that that need to be addressed and so
 
00:59:59.690 --> 00:59:59.700 align:start position:0%
um I guess
 
01:00:02.210 --> 01:00:02.220 align:start position:0%
uh I would support it
 
01:00:04.730 --> 01:00:04.740 align:start position:0%
um I think that
 
01:00:08.210 --> 01:00:08.220 align:start position:0%
I'm just wondering if if the
 
01:00:12.470 --> 01:00:12.480 align:start position:0%
the things heard by the
 
01:00:17.270 --> 01:00:17.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:19.849 --> 01:00:19.859 align:start position:0%
um kind of like how you think of um in
 
01:00:20.990 --> 01:00:21.000 align:start position:0%
the court system where it's like
 
01:00:23.210 --> 01:00:23.220 align:start position:0%
precedent like if you if someone else
 
01:00:25.370 --> 01:00:25.380 align:start position:0%
comes with the exact same claim they're
 
01:00:27.890 --> 01:00:27.900 align:start position:0%
gonna get the same result whereas in the
 
01:00:30.589 --> 01:00:30.599 align:start position:0%
zba like you're not just because one of
 
01:00:32.390 --> 01:00:32.400 align:start position:0%
them got approved doesn't mean the next
 
01:00:33.829 --> 01:00:33.839 align:start position:0%
one is going to get approved kind of a
 
01:00:35.630 --> 01:00:35.640 align:start position:0%
thing the housing appeals board is is
 
01:00:37.849 --> 01:00:37.859 align:start position:0%
part of the judicial branch okay um they
 
01:00:40.970 --> 01:00:40.980 align:start position:0%
would address and make rules I'm Ben's
 
01:00:43.069 --> 01:00:43.079 align:start position:0%
looking at me dude so he's having a
 
01:00:44.589 --> 01:00:44.599 align:start position:0%
heart but they would they would address
 
01:00:48.109 --> 01:00:48.119 align:start position:0%
these things and make rulings on it so
 
01:00:50.990 --> 01:00:51.000 align:start position:0%
I think you might want comment
 
01:00:53.030 --> 01:00:53.040 align:start position:0%
this this would just provide another
 
01:00:55.549 --> 01:00:55.559 align:start position:0%
option for somebody that feels aggrieved
 
01:00:58.430 --> 01:00:58.440 align:start position:0%
during the um process and this would
 
01:01:00.410 --> 01:01:00.420 align:start position:0%
address state only so this would not do
 
01:01:01.609 --> 01:01:01.619 align:start position:0%
anything to override local
 
01:01:01.619 --> 01:01:03.470 align:start position:0%
anything to override local
municipalities

01:01:03.470 --> 01:01:03.480 align:start position:0%
municipalities
 
01:01:06.289 --> 01:01:06.299 align:start position:0%
um it would just expand it to uh state
 
01:01:12.410 --> 01:01:12.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:14.750 --> 01:01:14.760 align:start position:0%
representative Walsh yeah hi thank you
 
01:01:15.770 --> 01:01:15.780 align:start position:0%
Mr chair
 
01:01:18.109 --> 01:01:18.119 align:start position:0%
um do they have the the
 
01:01:20.510 --> 01:01:20.520 align:start position:0%
background for these types of questions
 
01:01:23.150 --> 01:01:23.160 align:start position:0%
permits and licenses as opposed to if
 
01:01:25.250 --> 01:01:25.260 align:start position:0%
you read their charges basically land
 
01:01:28.370 --> 01:01:28.380 align:start position:0%
use law that they deal with
 
01:01:30.710 --> 01:01:30.720 align:start position:0%
have you is anybody inquired on that I
 
01:01:31.789 --> 01:01:31.799 align:start position:0%
don't know if they have the expertise of
 
01:01:34.730 --> 01:01:34.740 align:start position:0%
my question that that is what I
 
01:01:36.650 --> 01:01:36.660 align:start position:0%
there there was a concern that they
 
01:01:38.589 --> 01:01:38.599 align:start position:0%
didn't have the the subject matter
 
01:01:42.710 --> 01:01:42.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:45.170 --> 01:01:45.180 align:start position:0%
they have the expertise around
 
01:01:45.180 --> 01:01:46.490 align:start position:0%
they have the expertise around
um

01:01:46.490 --> 01:01:46.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:01:48.710 --> 01:01:48.720 align:start position:0%
housing and Housing Development so I
 
01:01:51.109 --> 01:01:51.119 align:start position:0%
think I we could stretch it to say that
 
01:01:53.809 --> 01:01:53.819 align:start position:0%
this impedes the development or private
 
01:01:56.270 --> 01:01:56.280 align:start position:0%
property rights I I would say that
 
01:01:58.190 --> 01:01:58.200 align:start position:0%
they should have it
 
01:02:00.289 --> 01:02:00.299 align:start position:0%
um but that's a good question
 
01:02:02.390 --> 01:02:02.400 align:start position:0%
go ahead yeah follow up
 
01:02:05.150 --> 01:02:05.160 align:start position:0%
um on the actual change itself to the
 
01:02:08.630 --> 01:02:08.640 align:start position:0%
statute do we want to limit it to
 
01:02:10.970 --> 01:02:10.980 align:start position:0%
permits or licenses related to housing
 
01:02:12.770 --> 01:02:12.780 align:start position:0%
and Housing Development
 
01:02:14.510 --> 01:02:14.520 align:start position:0%
or could we just say
 
01:02:16.430 --> 01:02:16.440 align:start position:0%
here appeals related to state issues
 
01:02:18.770 --> 01:02:18.780 align:start position:0%
permanences permits or licenses period
 
01:02:21.650 --> 01:02:21.660 align:start position:0%
in other words why is you could have the
 
01:02:22.789 --> 01:02:22.799 align:start position:0%
same issues with the commercial
 
01:02:24.470 --> 01:02:24.480 align:start position:0%
development as well
 
01:02:26.930 --> 01:02:26.940 align:start position:0%
just a thought that would I mean that
 
01:02:29.150 --> 01:02:29.160 align:start position:0%
would definitely go outside the purview
 
01:02:30.589 --> 01:02:30.599 align:start position:0%
of the housing appeals board who would
 
01:02:32.990 --> 01:02:33.000 align:start position:0%
address this housing only issues so
 
01:02:34.370 --> 01:02:34.380 align:start position:0%
that's why we left that language in
 
01:02:34.380 --> 01:02:37.430 align:start position:0%
that's why we left that language in
there

01:02:37.430 --> 01:02:37.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:41.870 --> 01:02:41.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:41.880 --> 01:02:44.150 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:02:44.150 --> 01:02:44.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:46.370 --> 01:02:46.380 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair uh Michael Hagan
 
01:02:47.750 --> 01:02:47.760 align:start position:0%
representing the building code review
 
01:02:47.760 --> 01:02:48.829 align:start position:0%
representing the building code review
board

01:02:48.829 --> 01:02:48.839 align:start position:0%
board
 
01:02:51.289 --> 01:02:51.299 align:start position:0%
um currently the you're saying state
 
01:02:52.849 --> 01:02:52.859 align:start position:0%
permits issued
 
01:02:56.150 --> 01:02:56.160 align:start position:0%
um if I found the section RSA
 
01:02:58.549 --> 01:02:58.559 align:start position:0%
um a11 for the appeals decisions for the
 
01:03:00.049 --> 01:03:00.059 align:start position:0%
State Fire Marshal that specifically
 
01:03:01.730 --> 01:03:01.740 align:start position:0%
States in there and a lot of
 
01:03:03.530 --> 01:03:03.540 align:start position:0%
municipalities use this State Fire
 
01:03:06.410 --> 01:03:06.420 align:start position:0%
Marshal's Office for building permits so
 
01:03:09.109 --> 01:03:09.119 align:start position:0%
my question would be is if you put this
 
01:03:11.270 --> 01:03:11.280 align:start position:0%
in this section as well they have to go
 
01:03:12.770 --> 01:03:12.780 align:start position:0%
to that appeals board as well as the
 
01:03:14.630 --> 01:03:14.640 align:start position:0%
building code review review board for
 
01:03:16.490 --> 01:03:16.500 align:start position:0%
appeals did you see how they can make
 
01:03:18.109 --> 01:03:18.119 align:start position:0%
conflict on each other and they might
 
01:03:20.650 --> 01:03:20.660 align:start position:0%
have to go two paths to get a decision
 
01:03:24.049 --> 01:03:24.059 align:start position:0%
and which one would rule on on the final
 
01:03:26.510 --> 01:03:26.520 align:start position:0%
decision so so my question when I that's
 
01:03:28.430 --> 01:03:28.440 align:start position:0%
why I asked you
 
01:03:30.829 --> 01:03:30.839 align:start position:0%
um does your board have the teeth to
 
01:03:33.770 --> 01:03:33.780 align:start position:0%
actually make the ruling and
 
01:03:36.589 --> 01:03:36.599 align:start position:0%
I know this board does I didn't get a
 
01:03:38.270 --> 01:03:38.280 align:start position:0%
clear answer from you whether your board
 
01:03:38.280 --> 01:03:39.230 align:start position:0%
clear answer from you whether your board
did

01:03:39.230 --> 01:03:39.240 align:start position:0%
did
 
01:03:41.390 --> 01:03:41.400 align:start position:0%
it does that make sense it is a final
 
01:03:43.250 --> 01:03:43.260 align:start position:0%
decision so it would overrule the local
 
01:03:46.370 --> 01:03:46.380 align:start position:0%
zoning it would overrule the local
 
01:03:48.530 --> 01:03:48.540 align:start position:0%
um building official or State Farm
 
01:03:50.750 --> 01:03:50.760 align:start position:0%
Marshall's office this would be the the
 
01:03:52.970 --> 01:03:52.980 align:start position:0%
final decision that then again could be
 
01:03:54.950 --> 01:03:54.960 align:start position:0%
appealed to Spirit core there's still
 
01:03:58.190 --> 01:03:58.200 align:start position:0%
that final path and does your board also
 
01:04:00.410 --> 01:04:00.420 align:start position:0%
set precedent with with some of these
 
01:04:02.450 --> 01:04:02.460 align:start position:0%
things are these are these decisions
 
01:04:04.490 --> 01:04:04.500 align:start position:0%
able to be made in the superior court
 
01:04:05.750 --> 01:04:05.760 align:start position:0%
and cited
 
01:04:07.370 --> 01:04:07.380 align:start position:0%
as president
 
01:04:09.650 --> 01:04:09.660 align:start position:0%
I could not answer that question
 
01:04:11.210 --> 01:04:11.220 align:start position:0%
um but the Attorney General's office
 
01:04:13.130 --> 01:04:13.140 align:start position:0%
could answer that question that we do
 
01:04:15.470 --> 01:04:15.480 align:start position:0%
one does sit on our board for these
 
01:04:16.970 --> 01:04:16.980 align:start position:0%
specific hearings
 
01:04:22.130 --> 01:04:22.140 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:22.140 --> 01:04:23.809 align:start position:0%
 
representative

01:04:23.809 --> 01:04:23.819 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:04:25.490 --> 01:04:25.500 align:start position:0%
yeah thanks Mr chair can you repeat what
 
01:04:27.349 --> 01:04:27.359 align:start position:0%
you said about issuing the issuance of
 
01:04:29.210 --> 01:04:29.220 align:start position:0%
building permits did you say that my
 
01:04:32.150 --> 01:04:32.160 align:start position:0%
fire marshal office does that as well so
 
01:04:34.730 --> 01:04:34.740 align:start position:0%
under RSA 674
 
01:04:36.650 --> 01:04:36.660 align:start position:0%
um local municipalities have to enfor
 
01:04:38.809 --> 01:04:38.819 align:start position:0%
have to adopt an enforcement mechanism
 
01:04:40.190 --> 01:04:40.200 align:start position:0%
in order to enforce the State Building
 
01:04:43.970 --> 01:04:43.980 align:start position:0%
Code if they don't have the means or or
 
01:04:43.980 --> 01:04:45.609 align:start position:0%
Code if they don't have the means or or
um

01:04:45.609 --> 01:04:45.619 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:04:49.190 --> 01:04:49.200 align:start position:0%
or anybody to take on the job they can
 
01:04:52.309 --> 01:04:52.319 align:start position:0%
have uh under that Authority have the
 
01:04:54.530 --> 01:04:54.540 align:start position:0%
State Fire Marshal's Office issue
 
01:04:57.890 --> 01:04:57.900 align:start position:0%
building permits under their system uh I
 
01:04:59.630 --> 01:04:59.640 align:start position:0%
believe right now Claremont uses them
 
01:05:02.329 --> 01:05:02.339 align:start position:0%
for a commercial uh buildings
 
01:05:04.970 --> 01:05:04.980 align:start position:0%
at this time so they in order to get a
 
01:05:06.470 --> 01:05:06.480 align:start position:0%
commercial building permit you go to
 
01:05:08.450 --> 01:05:08.460 align:start position:0%
State Farm Marshall's office you submit
 
01:05:09.829 --> 01:05:09.839 align:start position:0%
for your permit application they review
 
01:05:12.530 --> 01:05:12.540 align:start position:0%
it and do inspections
 
01:05:16.609 --> 01:05:16.619 align:start position:0%
how often is it housing like so how
 
01:05:18.950 --> 01:05:18.960 align:start position:0%
often do you have a I mean does the
 
01:05:20.690 --> 01:05:20.700 align:start position:0%
State Farm Marshall's office deal with a
 
01:05:23.450 --> 01:05:23.460 align:start position:0%
lot of the housing permit code that
 
01:05:24.770 --> 01:05:24.780 align:start position:0%
would be a question for the State Farm
 
01:05:26.450 --> 01:05:26.460 align:start position:0%
Marshall I couldn't answer that thank
 
01:05:26.460 --> 01:05:27.470 align:start position:0%
Marshall I couldn't answer that thank
you

01:05:27.470 --> 01:05:27.480 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:05:30.530 --> 01:05:30.540 align:start position:0%
representative Kelly thank you but
 
01:05:33.770 --> 01:05:33.780 align:start position:0%
um I think that your your point was that
 
01:05:35.630 --> 01:05:35.640 align:start position:0%
they do like whether that be
 
01:05:38.030 --> 01:05:38.040 align:start position:0%
municipalities issuing or the State Fire
 
01:05:41.329 --> 01:05:41.339 align:start position:0%
Marshal issuing the appeals process is
 
01:05:43.270 --> 01:05:43.280 align:start position:0%
what you were trying to
 
01:05:46.670 --> 01:05:46.680 align:start position:0%
clarify right is that the appeals
 
01:05:50.809 --> 01:05:50.819 align:start position:0%
process is X right now and maybe we're
 
01:05:53.390 --> 01:05:53.400 align:start position:0%
adding an additional y to the process
 
01:05:56.630 --> 01:05:56.640 align:start position:0%
and it isn't necessarily that they are
 
01:05:59.510 --> 01:05:59.520 align:start position:0%
going to have to go to both maybe they
 
01:06:02.510 --> 01:06:02.520 align:start position:0%
could choose which one they go to
 
01:06:04.549 --> 01:06:04.559 align:start position:0%
um it seems like because under the
 
01:06:06.410 --> 01:06:06.420 align:start position:0%
language that he's proposing it says may
 
01:06:11.329 --> 01:06:11.339 align:start position:0%
right and so may go to this board if the
 
01:06:13.130 --> 01:06:13.140 align:start position:0%
other one also says may then they could
 
01:06:15.890 --> 01:06:15.900 align:start position:0%
essentially choose which board they want
 
01:06:18.890 --> 01:06:18.900 align:start position:0%
to hear the appeal maybe something like
 
01:06:21.829 --> 01:06:21.839 align:start position:0%
the speed of decisions might be a factor
 
01:06:23.870 --> 01:06:23.880 align:start position:0%
in whether or not they choose one or the
 
01:06:26.450 --> 01:06:26.460 align:start position:0%
other what what are your
 
01:06:28.370 --> 01:06:28.380 align:start position:0%
um can you explain a little bit more
 
01:06:30.049 --> 01:06:30.059 align:start position:0%
about your understanding of the process
 
01:06:32.329 --> 01:06:32.339 align:start position:0%
of the appeals from the
 
01:06:34.160 --> 01:06:34.170 align:start position:0%
um the the
 
01:06:34.170 --> 01:06:35.329 align:start position:0%
um the the
[Music]

01:06:35.329 --> 01:06:35.339 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:06:37.910 --> 01:06:37.920 align:start position:0%
decisions of the Fire Marshals
 
01:06:40.069 --> 01:06:40.079 align:start position:0%
um you know sure I can read it right
 
01:06:43.309 --> 01:06:43.319 align:start position:0%
from the RCA if if you'd like uh it's
 
01:06:46.789 --> 01:06:46.799 align:start position:0%
RSA again 155 a11 appeals of decision
 
01:06:49.370 --> 01:06:49.380 align:start position:0%
for the State Fire Marshal 2 which is
 
01:06:50.870 --> 01:06:50.880 align:start position:0%
the process the board shall hold a
 
01:06:52.849 --> 01:06:52.859 align:start position:0%
hearing within 40 days of receipt of the
 
01:06:55.370 --> 01:06:55.380 align:start position:0%
complaint unless extension of time has
 
01:06:57.529 --> 01:06:57.539 align:start position:0%
been granted by the board at a written
 
01:06:59.809 --> 01:06:59.819 align:start position:0%
request of one of the parties and shall
 
01:07:02.210 --> 01:07:02.220 align:start position:0%
render a decision within 30 days of the
 
01:07:11.630 --> 01:07:11.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:13.970 --> 01:07:13.980 align:start position:0%
housing appeals board has
 
01:07:16.190 --> 01:07:16.200 align:start position:0%
to make a decision
 
01:07:18.770 --> 01:07:18.780 align:start position:0%
it's a total of 150 days from the filing
 
01:07:20.870 --> 01:07:20.880 align:start position:0%
of an appeal thank you
 
01:07:23.690 --> 01:07:23.700 align:start position:0%
um so another question if
 
01:07:27.049 --> 01:07:27.059 align:start position:0%
there's a puddle in my on my property
 
01:07:30.890 --> 01:07:30.900 align:start position:0%
and it's ruled as a wetland is your
 
01:07:35.569 --> 01:07:35.579 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:38.690 --> 01:07:38.700 align:start position:0%
it is not okay I I'm not I'm not 100
 
01:07:42.950 --> 01:07:42.960 align:start position:0%
sure on that but I I can 99.9 guarantee
 
01:07:45.770 --> 01:07:45.780 align:start position:0%
we cannot hear it uh it's specific in
 
01:07:49.430 --> 01:07:49.440 align:start position:0%
that RSA 11 12 and 13 what what we can
 
01:07:52.849 --> 01:07:52.859 align:start position:0%
hear appeals on okay so so this would
 
01:07:55.190 --> 01:07:55.200 align:start position:0%
dovetail perfectly with your board to
 
01:07:57.710 --> 01:07:57.720 align:start position:0%
allow options for a private property
 
01:08:00.529 --> 01:08:00.539 align:start position:0%
owner to choose where to appeal
 
01:08:04.970 --> 01:08:04.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:07.970 --> 01:08:07.980 align:start position:0%
that's up for you to decide
 
01:08:10.609 --> 01:08:10.619 align:start position:0%
is there anything else on this area okay
 
01:08:12.970 --> 01:08:12.980 align:start position:0%
how's the committee feel about this
 
01:08:14.930 --> 01:08:14.940 align:start position:0%
in agreement
 
01:08:17.090 --> 01:08:17.100 align:start position:0%
okay I'm going to file this LSR and I'll
 
01:08:18.829 --> 01:08:18.839 align:start position:0%
include the whole family um the whole
 
01:08:18.839 --> 01:08:21.669 align:start position:0%
include the whole family um the whole
committee

01:08:21.669 --> 01:08:21.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:23.510 --> 01:08:23.520 align:start position:0%
yeah okay
 
01:08:26.809 --> 01:08:26.819 align:start position:0%
okay so next on the agenda I want to
 
01:08:29.510 --> 01:08:29.520 align:start position:0%
bring in Des and I want to call on
 
01:08:31.130 --> 01:08:31.140 align:start position:0%
representative McConkey to kind of kick
 
01:08:32.209 --> 01:08:32.219 align:start position:0%
us off
 
01:08:34.430 --> 01:08:34.440 align:start position:0%
thank you yep thank you chair and
 
01:08:34.440 --> 01:08:36.050 align:start position:0%
thank you yep thank you chair and
Alexander

01:08:36.050 --> 01:08:36.060 align:start position:0%
Alexander
 
01:08:39.950 --> 01:08:39.960 align:start position:0%
um I um I have a report here
 
01:08:42.470 --> 01:08:42.480 align:start position:0%
I haven't gotten quite as far as other
 
01:08:45.110 --> 01:08:45.120 align:start position:0%
members have with draft legislation but
 
01:08:48.050 --> 01:08:48.060 align:start position:0%
I'm uh soon to be there and I I
 
01:08:50.390 --> 01:08:50.400 align:start position:0%
apologize to the representatives on the
 
01:08:52.970 --> 01:08:52.980 align:start position:0%
end I have it available online I'm short
 
01:08:55.970 --> 01:08:55.980 align:start position:0%
by two copies of this but I'll read my
 
01:08:55.980 --> 01:08:57.590 align:start position:0%
by two copies of this but I'll read my
testimony

01:08:57.590 --> 01:08:57.600 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
01:09:00.590 --> 01:09:00.600 align:start position:0%
I explored two reoccurring themes that
 
01:09:03.110 --> 01:09:03.120 align:start position:0%
we discussed here in committee first
 
01:09:05.510 --> 01:09:05.520 align:start position:0%
being that the New Hampshire Department
 
01:09:07.550 --> 01:09:07.560 align:start position:0%
of Environmental Services was out of
 
01:09:10.370 --> 01:09:10.380 align:start position:0%
touch with daily design flows water
 
01:09:10.380 --> 01:09:11.510 align:start position:0%
touch with daily design flows water
usage

01:09:11.510 --> 01:09:11.520 align:start position:0%
usage
 
01:09:13.669 --> 01:09:13.679 align:start position:0%
as it appears that our numbers are
 
01:09:16.309 --> 01:09:16.319 align:start position:0%
higher than our neighboring states are
 
01:09:18.590 --> 01:09:18.600 align:start position:0%
our numbers based in science
 
01:09:21.110 --> 01:09:21.120 align:start position:0%
secondly if we lower the required area
 
01:09:24.050 --> 01:09:24.060 align:start position:0%
for an on-site septic system
 
01:09:27.289 --> 01:09:27.299 align:start position:0%
wouldn't subdivision lot sizing also be
 
01:09:30.470 --> 01:09:30.480 align:start position:0%
reduced yielding higher density or more
 
01:09:32.809 --> 01:09:32.819 align:start position:0%
units per acre
 
01:09:34.849 --> 01:09:34.859 align:start position:0%
I started by comparing New Hampshire
 
01:09:37.910 --> 01:09:37.920 align:start position:0%
subsurface regulations to those in Maine
 
01:09:39.769 --> 01:09:39.779 align:start position:0%
two states that I have designed
 
01:09:41.269 --> 01:09:41.279 align:start position:0%
experience in
 
01:09:44.510 --> 01:09:44.520 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire used a design flow of 150
 
01:09:47.689 --> 01:09:47.699 align:start position:0%
gallons per day for each bedroom while
 
01:09:51.110 --> 01:09:51.120 align:start position:0%
Maine only uses 90 gallons per day flow
 
01:09:51.120 --> 01:09:52.189 align:start position:0%
Maine only uses 90 gallons per day flow
rate

01:09:52.189 --> 01:09:52.199 align:start position:0%
rate
 
01:09:54.530 --> 01:09:54.540 align:start position:0%
so on the surface main lot loading
 
01:09:57.410 --> 01:09:57.420 align:start position:0%
requirement is 40 percent less than ours
 
01:10:00.290 --> 01:10:00.300 align:start position:0%
so that must equate to smaller septic
 
01:10:02.450 --> 01:10:02.460 align:start position:0%
system requirements
 
01:10:04.490 --> 01:10:04.500 align:start position:0%
there is a second factor in septic
 
01:10:07.070 --> 01:10:07.080 align:start position:0%
design and that is to consider the soil
 
01:10:10.610 --> 01:10:10.620 align:start position:0%
itself and for Simplicity let's call the
 
01:10:14.510 --> 01:10:14.520 align:start position:0%
quality of the native soil as great good
 
01:10:16.370 --> 01:10:16.380 align:start position:0%
or poor
 
01:10:19.490 --> 01:10:19.500 align:start position:0%
and finally in an attempt to keep the
 
01:10:22.250 --> 01:10:22.260 align:start position:0%
comparison realistic I chose a stone and
 
01:10:25.250 --> 01:10:25.260 align:start position:0%
pipe leech field which is the old tried
 
01:10:27.649 --> 01:10:27.659 align:start position:0%
and true system used in both of these
 
01:10:27.659 --> 01:10:28.610 align:start position:0%
and true system used in both of these
states

01:10:28.610 --> 01:10:28.620 align:start position:0%
states
 
01:10:30.709 --> 01:10:30.719 align:start position:0%
I have enclosed a chart for this
 
01:10:34.250 --> 01:10:34.260 align:start position:0%
comparison and I will run the numbers
 
01:10:37.310 --> 01:10:37.320 align:start position:0%
but basically despite the deci design
 
01:10:40.370 --> 01:10:40.380 align:start position:0%
flow being 40 percent higher in New
 
01:10:43.910 --> 01:10:43.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the system size is most cases
 
01:10:47.330 --> 01:10:47.340 align:start position:0%
is similar or smaller in New Hampshire
 
01:10:49.270 --> 01:10:49.280 align:start position:0%
than in Maine
 
01:10:52.970 --> 01:10:52.980 align:start position:0%
in closed I have a sheet that talks
 
01:10:56.870 --> 01:10:56.880 align:start position:0%
about best average and bad soil
 
01:11:00.890 --> 01:11:00.900 align:start position:0%
in Maine the best soil New Hampshire is
 
01:11:05.330 --> 01:11:05.340 align:start position:0%
actually a 142 square foot lesson size
 
01:11:09.890 --> 01:11:09.900 align:start position:0%
on average soil New Hampshire is all but
 
01:11:13.430 --> 01:11:13.440 align:start position:0%
64 square feet larger than Maine
 
01:11:18.709 --> 01:11:18.719 align:start position:0%
and in poor or bad soil New Hampshire is
 
01:11:21.770 --> 01:11:21.780 align:start position:0%
40 percent or 40 square feet less than
 
01:11:24.709 --> 01:11:24.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:28.550 --> 01:11:28.560 align:start position:0%
the state did take a lesser design flow
 
01:11:30.709 --> 01:11:30.719 align:start position:0%
in response to senior housing a number
 
01:11:34.070 --> 01:11:34.080 align:start position:0%
of years ago and adjusted the daily flow
 
01:11:38.149 --> 01:11:38.159 align:start position:0%
rate from 150 gallons per bedroom to I
 
01:11:40.610 --> 01:11:40.620 align:start position:0%
believe it's 125 presently
 
01:11:43.550 --> 01:11:43.560 align:start position:0%
the premise was that older adults 65
 
01:11:46.189 --> 01:11:46.199 align:start position:0%
years of age are less active and would
 
01:11:49.669 --> 01:11:49.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:51.770 --> 01:11:51.780 align:start position:0%
sounds right on the surface but the
 
01:11:54.590 --> 01:11:54.600 align:start position:0%
definition of adult has has been reduced
 
01:11:58.070 --> 01:11:58.080 align:start position:0%
now to 55 and older communities and now
 
01:12:01.850 --> 01:12:01.860 align:start position:0%
yet another person can live there also
 
01:12:03.530 --> 01:12:03.540 align:start position:0%
As a caretaker
 
01:12:06.050 --> 01:12:06.060 align:start position:0%
the drop in age did not carry through on
 
01:12:08.330 --> 01:12:08.340 align:start position:0%
the original premise of less active
 
01:12:08.340 --> 01:12:09.770 align:start position:0%
the original premise of less active
population

01:12:09.770 --> 01:12:09.780 align:start position:0%
population
 
01:12:11.870 --> 01:12:11.880 align:start position:0%
and the southern area of our state I
 
01:12:13.729 --> 01:12:13.739 align:start position:0%
understand it's beginning to experience
 
01:12:17.209 --> 01:12:17.219 align:start position:0%
a higher than typical septic failure
 
01:12:18.890 --> 01:12:18.900 align:start position:0%
rate and that's because there's more
 
01:12:21.110 --> 01:12:21.120 align:start position:0%
water than they ever anticipated more
 
01:12:25.010 --> 01:12:25.020 align:start position:0%
water more sewer it doesn't hold up
 
01:12:27.950 --> 01:12:27.960 align:start position:0%
so what is the science behind our flow
 
01:12:27.960 --> 01:12:29.090 align:start position:0%
so what is the science behind our flow
rates

01:12:29.090 --> 01:12:29.100 align:start position:0%
rates
 
01:12:33.470 --> 01:12:33.480 align:start position:0%
in 2003 the Society of soil scientists
 
01:12:35.630 --> 01:12:35.640 align:start position:0%
of Northern New England commissioned a
 
01:12:39.290 --> 01:12:39.300 align:start position:0%
study to look at soil-based lot sizing
 
01:12:42.590 --> 01:12:42.600 align:start position:0%
and I have a copy of
 
01:12:45.290 --> 01:12:45.300 align:start position:0%
of that sheet in in my report that's
 
01:12:45.300 --> 01:12:47.510 align:start position:0%
of that sheet in in my report that's
here

01:12:47.510 --> 01:12:47.520 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:12:50.270 --> 01:12:50.280 align:start position:0%
when this highly anticipated planning
 
01:12:52.970 --> 01:12:52.980 align:start position:0%
document was completed it demonstrated
 
01:12:55.490 --> 01:12:55.500 align:start position:0%
that many New Hampshire towns were
 
01:12:58.729 --> 01:12:58.739 align:start position:0%
calling for larger lot sizes than the
 
01:13:00.470 --> 01:13:00.480 align:start position:0%
science suggested
 
01:13:03.169 --> 01:13:03.179 align:start position:0%
but when we looked at the state it was
 
01:13:05.770 --> 01:13:05.780 align:start position:0%
generally in line with their findings
 
01:13:08.870 --> 01:13:08.880 align:start position:0%
and the Des subsurface did not adjust
 
01:13:12.169 --> 01:13:12.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:14.570 --> 01:13:14.580 align:start position:0%
what the state has learned is that water
 
01:13:18.110 --> 01:13:18.120 align:start position:0%
usage is ever evolving and the best tool
 
01:13:20.750 --> 01:13:20.760 align:start position:0%
for sizing systems is to use metered
 
01:13:20.760 --> 01:13:22.010 align:start position:0%
for sizing systems is to use metered
flow

01:13:22.010 --> 01:13:22.020 align:start position:0%
flow
 
01:13:24.890 --> 01:13:24.900 align:start position:0%
using similar uses based on a number of
 
01:13:28.430 --> 01:13:28.440 align:start position:0%
persons occupying a space ideally over a
 
01:13:31.910 --> 01:13:31.920 align:start position:0%
year's time and then multiplying that
 
01:13:35.450 --> 01:13:35.460 align:start position:0%
flow by a factor of one or two depending
 
01:13:38.689 --> 01:13:38.699 align:start position:0%
on the type of strength of waste in
 
01:13:41.030 --> 01:13:41.040 align:start position:0%
addition flow Factor takes into account
 
01:13:43.910 --> 01:13:43.920 align:start position:0%
periods of high use example in the
 
01:13:46.070 --> 01:13:46.080 align:start position:0%
morning when everyone gets up in showers
 
01:13:49.310 --> 01:13:49.320 align:start position:0%
makes breakfast or days multiple wash
 
01:13:53.090 --> 01:13:53.100 align:start position:0%
loads or extended guest visits that
 
01:13:55.550 --> 01:13:55.560 align:start position:0%
create larger flow that the system must
 
01:13:58.430 --> 01:13:58.440 align:start position:0%
absorb quickly so that the extra
 
01:14:03.229 --> 01:14:03.239 align:start position:0%
capacity in the design flow adds to the
 
01:14:06.050 --> 01:14:06.060 align:start position:0%
system's longevity as opposed to when I
 
01:14:08.930 --> 01:14:08.940 align:start position:0%
spoke to the senior housing that it
 
01:14:11.450 --> 01:14:11.460 align:start position:0%
caused a premature failure
 
01:14:14.930 --> 01:14:14.940 align:start position:0%
what I don't suggest while I don't
 
01:14:17.630 --> 01:14:17.640 align:start position:0%
suggest a wholesale adjustment to our
 
01:14:21.290 --> 01:14:21.300 align:start position:0%
daily flow rates at this time I do
 
01:14:24.110 --> 01:14:24.120 align:start position:0%
suggest that we legislate changes to
 
01:14:27.050 --> 01:14:27.060 align:start position:0%
construction requirements for effluent
 
01:14:31.250 --> 01:14:31.260 align:start position:0%
disposal areas Eda most people would
 
01:14:33.590 --> 01:14:33.600 align:start position:0%
refer to as a septic system
 
01:14:36.350 --> 01:14:36.360 align:start position:0%
without getting too technical the
 
01:14:38.570 --> 01:14:38.580 align:start position:0%
determination of whether a septic system
 
01:14:42.709 --> 01:14:42.719 align:start position:0%
can be constructed in ground or if the
 
01:14:44.870 --> 01:14:44.880 align:start position:0%
system will need to be mounded and have
 
01:14:47.870 --> 01:14:47.880 align:start position:0%
a pump is is by the depth of the
 
01:14:51.709 --> 01:14:51.719 align:start position:0%
seasonal high water table shwt
 
01:14:55.370 --> 01:14:55.380 align:start position:0%
presently the standard for traditional
 
01:14:57.770 --> 01:14:57.780 align:start position:0%
construction is four feet above that
 
01:14:57.780 --> 01:14:58.910 align:start position:0%
construction is four feet above that
marker

01:14:58.910 --> 01:14:58.920 align:start position:0%
marker
 
01:15:01.669 --> 01:15:01.679 align:start position:0%
but in the event of a failure the design
 
01:15:04.430 --> 01:15:04.440 align:start position:0%
standard is reduced to only two feet
 
01:15:07.370 --> 01:15:07.380 align:start position:0%
above seasonal high water
 
01:15:08.630 --> 01:15:08.640 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Department of
 
01:15:10.970 --> 01:15:10.980 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services subsurface has
 
01:15:13.930 --> 01:15:13.940 align:start position:0%
Decades of results that replacement
 
01:15:17.030 --> 01:15:17.040 align:start position:0%
traditional septic systems Stone and
 
01:15:19.729 --> 01:15:19.739 align:start position:0%
pipe chamber system and others function
 
01:15:22.669 --> 01:15:22.679 align:start position:0%
every bit as well at that elevation as
 
01:15:24.709 --> 01:15:24.719 align:start position:0%
those constructed at the four foot
 
01:15:27.410 --> 01:15:27.420 align:start position:0%
marker two foot higher
 
01:15:30.290 --> 01:15:30.300 align:start position:0%
I suggest this change in itself will
 
01:15:32.570 --> 01:15:32.580 align:start position:0%
permit the cost of develop of a
 
01:15:35.630 --> 01:15:35.640 align:start position:0%
developed lot to be greatly reduced with
 
01:15:38.570 --> 01:15:38.580 align:start position:0%
no ill effect on the environment
 
01:15:42.350 --> 01:15:42.360 align:start position:0%
I'm working on language and I believe I
 
01:15:45.729 --> 01:15:45.739 align:start position:0%
will have a buy-in
 
01:15:48.530 --> 01:15:48.540 align:start position:0%
I will have Department buy and providing
 
01:15:50.570 --> 01:15:50.580 align:start position:0%
a six inch layer of sand under the
 
01:15:53.689 --> 01:15:53.699 align:start position:0%
system is added to further Safeguard the
 
01:15:53.699 --> 01:15:55.010 align:start position:0%
system is added to further Safeguard the
aquifer

01:15:55.010 --> 01:15:55.020 align:start position:0%
aquifer
 
01:15:57.490 --> 01:15:57.500 align:start position:0%
if you can if you can construct
 
01:16:00.229 --> 01:16:00.239 align:start position:0%
in-ground without the need of pump
 
01:16:04.130 --> 01:16:04.140 align:start position:0%
Chambers pumps alarms electricians to
 
01:16:06.590 --> 01:16:06.600 align:start position:0%
tie in the required components
 
01:16:09.649 --> 01:16:09.659 align:start position:0%
the homeowner or and or the developer
 
01:16:12.590 --> 01:16:12.600 align:start position:0%
can realize the savings of a thousands
 
01:16:15.470 --> 01:16:15.480 align:start position:0%
of dollars per system thousands not
 
01:16:15.480 --> 01:16:16.970 align:start position:0%
of dollars per system thousands not
hundreds

01:16:16.970 --> 01:16:16.980 align:start position:0%
hundreds
 
01:16:20.090 --> 01:16:20.100 align:start position:0%
I offer this report based on my 30 years
 
01:16:23.030 --> 01:16:23.040 align:start position:0%
of septic design install practice
 
01:16:27.050 --> 01:16:27.060 align:start position:0%
my research of soil based data and
 
01:16:28.970 --> 01:16:28.980 align:start position:0%
conversations with the power
 
01:16:30.970 --> 01:16:30.980 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services
 
01:16:34.550 --> 01:16:34.560 align:start position:0%
subsurface personnel and I submit to you
 
01:16:39.169 --> 01:16:39.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:40.910 --> 01:16:40.920 align:start position:0%
well thank you very much that's very
 
01:16:42.229 --> 01:16:42.239 align:start position:0%
detailed that certain some of that
 
01:16:43.850 --> 01:16:43.860 align:start position:0%
certainly went over my head but I
 
01:16:45.770 --> 01:16:45.780 align:start position:0%
believe you know well I've got two
 
01:16:45.780 --> 01:16:47.050 align:start position:0%
believe you know well I've got two
exercises

01:16:47.050 --> 01:16:47.060 align:start position:0%
exercises
 
01:16:49.669 --> 01:16:49.679 align:start position:0%
to weigh in on this is there anything
 
01:16:51.169 --> 01:16:51.179 align:start position:0%
from the committee before I call on Des
 
01:16:53.450 --> 01:16:53.460 align:start position:0%
uh representative Reed
 
01:16:55.189 --> 01:16:55.199 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
01:16:57.709 --> 01:16:57.719 align:start position:0%
representative for this work and also I
 
01:17:00.110 --> 01:17:00.120 align:start position:0%
saw that the researchers sent us the
 
01:17:02.630 --> 01:17:02.640 align:start position:0%
soil based lot sizing report that you
 
01:17:04.850 --> 01:17:04.860 align:start position:0%
requested I haven't read it yet but um
 
01:17:06.890 --> 01:17:06.900 align:start position:0%
thank you for doing that
 
01:17:09.050 --> 01:17:09.060 align:start position:0%
um one of the things we heard in a
 
01:17:11.510 --> 01:17:11.520 align:start position:0%
presentation which now
 
01:17:13.189 --> 01:17:13.199 align:start position:0%
I don't know if it was DS I think it was
 
01:17:14.990 --> 01:17:15.000 align:start position:0%
somebody else had presented to us was
 
01:17:17.810 --> 01:17:17.820 align:start position:0%
talking about the technological
 
01:17:17.820 --> 01:17:19.490 align:start position:0%
talking about the technological
developments

01:17:19.490 --> 01:17:19.500 align:start position:0%
developments
 
01:17:22.189 --> 01:17:22.199 align:start position:0%
um with these systems that that have
 
01:17:26.330 --> 01:17:26.340 align:start position:0%
increasingly reduced the need for
 
01:17:28.790 --> 01:17:28.800 align:start position:0%
um land um to far far less than what
 
01:17:32.390 --> 01:17:32.400 align:start position:0%
many of our municipality uh lot minimums
 
01:17:35.330 --> 01:17:35.340 align:start position:0%
are it sounds like from your report it's
 
01:17:38.270 --> 01:17:38.280 align:start position:0%
already even in the poorest soil we're
 
01:17:41.209 --> 01:17:41.219 align:start position:0%
talking about a need of
 
01:17:45.169 --> 01:17:45.179 align:start position:0%
13 1400 square feet so obviously
 
01:17:47.209 --> 01:17:47.219 align:start position:0%
municipalities that have 20 acre lot
 
01:17:50.330 --> 01:17:50.340 align:start position:0%
minimums are way way out of of touch
 
01:17:50.340 --> 01:17:51.229 align:start position:0%
minimums are way way out of of touch
with

01:17:51.229 --> 01:17:51.239 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:17:53.270 --> 01:17:53.280 align:start position:0%
specifically with with that being a
 
01:17:53.280 --> 01:17:54.649 align:start position:0%
specifically with with that being a
Cause

01:17:54.649 --> 01:17:54.659 align:start position:0%
Cause
 
01:17:57.890 --> 01:17:57.900 align:start position:0%
um is there do you see and you you know
 
01:17:59.990 --> 01:18:00.000 align:start position:0%
the technology better
 
01:18:03.590 --> 01:18:03.600 align:start position:0%
um any way to maybe include in proposed
 
01:18:06.649 --> 01:18:06.659 align:start position:0%
legislation a a tie-in to technology
 
01:18:10.250 --> 01:18:10.260 align:start position:0%
available so that it's technology
 
01:18:10.260 --> 01:18:14.330 align:start position:0%
available so that it's technology
dependent

01:18:14.330 --> 01:18:14.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:16.910 --> 01:18:16.920 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for the question
 
01:18:21.709 --> 01:18:21.719 align:start position:0%
I I started in thinking the same way you
 
01:18:25.910 --> 01:18:25.920 align:start position:0%
are and I have
 
01:18:28.669 --> 01:18:28.679 align:start position:0%
Fair experience with Innovative
 
01:18:28.679 --> 01:18:30.490 align:start position:0%
Fair experience with Innovative
technology

01:18:30.490 --> 01:18:30.500 align:start position:0%
technology
 
01:18:33.290 --> 01:18:33.300 align:start position:0%
that is approved by the state and
 
01:18:35.530 --> 01:18:35.540 align:start position:0%
reviewed and approved by Des
 
01:18:39.410 --> 01:18:39.420 align:start position:0%
and I and it does provide a wonderful
 
01:18:43.189 --> 01:18:43.199 align:start position:0%
opportunity in certain instances to put
 
01:18:46.930 --> 01:18:46.940 align:start position:0%
a system back on the lot that was sub
 
01:18:52.570 --> 01:18:52.580 align:start position:0%
subsized the 70s subdivision question
 
01:18:55.790 --> 01:18:55.800 align:start position:0%
a property that now is in existence and
 
01:18:59.209 --> 01:18:59.219 align:start position:0%
has a grandfathered right for a much
 
01:19:02.510 --> 01:19:02.520 align:start position:0%
larger use on a property
 
01:19:06.110 --> 01:19:06.120 align:start position:0%
um and um so at Last Resort we always
 
01:19:07.669 --> 01:19:07.679 align:start position:0%
try and grow traditional Last Resort
 
01:19:09.770 --> 01:19:09.780 align:start position:0%
that works fine
 
01:19:13.370 --> 01:19:13.380 align:start position:0%
um I think we are I think we need to do
 
01:19:14.750 --> 01:19:14.760 align:start position:0%
more work
 
01:19:18.770 --> 01:19:18.780 align:start position:0%
on long-term studies and making sure
 
01:19:21.130 --> 01:19:21.140 align:start position:0%
that once these systems are put in place
 
01:19:24.350 --> 01:19:24.360 align:start position:0%
that they continue to perform the way
 
01:19:27.770 --> 01:19:27.780 align:start position:0%
they started out many of the systems
 
01:19:30.169 --> 01:19:30.179 align:start position:0%
have a
 
01:19:32.689 --> 01:19:32.699 align:start position:0%
have you have to assign a service
 
01:19:36.169 --> 01:19:36.179 align:start position:0%
contract so an agent of the of the
 
01:19:38.270 --> 01:19:38.280 align:start position:0%
technological company comes out and
 
01:19:40.970 --> 01:19:40.980 align:start position:0%
ensures that it's running properly but
 
01:19:43.070 --> 01:19:43.080 align:start position:0%
quite honestly it doesn't appear that
 
01:19:46.250 --> 01:19:46.260 align:start position:0%
there is much study continuing to make
 
01:19:48.169 --> 01:19:48.179 align:start position:0%
sure that they're functioning at the
 
01:19:49.850 --> 01:19:49.860 align:start position:0%
level they did when they first started
 
01:19:54.550 --> 01:19:54.560 align:start position:0%
so where I thought we should allow
 
01:19:58.189 --> 01:19:58.199 align:start position:0%
lot sizing to become smaller if we use
 
01:20:00.590 --> 01:20:00.600 align:start position:0%
more technology I don't think we're
 
01:20:03.229 --> 01:20:03.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:05.510 --> 01:20:05.520 align:start position:0%
thank you and it again it looks like
 
01:20:10.189 --> 01:20:10.199 align:start position:0%
even everything but inner city Lots
 
01:20:12.590 --> 01:20:12.600 align:start position:0%
wouldn't really be impacted in terms of
 
01:20:14.270 --> 01:20:14.280 align:start position:0%
a water need based on the numbers you
 
01:20:15.890 --> 01:20:15.900 align:start position:0%
have here is that correct and I'm sorry
 
01:20:19.450 --> 01:20:19.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:19.460 --> 01:20:21.410 align:start position:0%
 
ah

01:20:21.410 --> 01:20:21.420 align:start position:0%
ah
 
01:20:23.090 --> 01:20:23.100 align:start position:0%
inner city Lots being obviously
 
01:20:25.370 --> 01:20:25.380 align:start position:0%
typically on Municipal Water so when you
 
01:20:28.070 --> 01:20:28.080 align:start position:0%
when even in the worst worst possible
 
01:20:30.470 --> 01:20:30.480 align:start position:0%
soil we're looking at 1300 square feet
 
01:20:32.990 --> 01:20:33.000 align:start position:0%
required that's only going to impact a
 
01:20:35.750 --> 01:20:35.760 align:start position:0%
very very small lot anything a half acre
 
01:20:37.490 --> 01:20:37.500 align:start position:0%
or larger can easily accommodate that
 
01:20:40.729 --> 01:20:40.739 align:start position:0%
right and so I would tend to agree if we
 
01:20:46.669 --> 01:20:46.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:46.679 --> 01:20:48.229 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:20:48.229 --> 01:20:48.239 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:20:50.630 --> 01:20:50.640 align:start position:0%
would someone from Des please come up
 
01:20:53.330 --> 01:20:53.340 align:start position:0%
and give us feedback on this and let us
 
01:20:55.910 --> 01:20:55.920 align:start position:0%
know where you're at on this legislation
 
01:21:08.209 --> 01:21:08.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:10.010 --> 01:21:10.020 align:start position:0%
good morning for the record I'm Phil
 
01:21:11.750 --> 01:21:11.760 align:start position:0%
Trowbridge manager of the land resource
 
01:21:13.790 --> 01:21:13.800 align:start position:0%
management programs at DES
 
01:21:15.350 --> 01:21:15.360 align:start position:0%
cription yeah for the record I'm the
 
01:21:17.350 --> 01:21:17.360 align:start position:0%
director of The Water Division at DES
 
01:21:19.430 --> 01:21:19.440 align:start position:0%
welcome back
 
01:21:23.570 --> 01:21:23.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:27.110 --> 01:21:27.120 align:start position:0%
so okay just for to start out thank you
 
01:21:29.090 --> 01:21:29.100 align:start position:0%
representative McConkey for your
 
01:21:30.430 --> 01:21:30.440 align:start position:0%
detailed report
 
01:21:32.990 --> 01:21:33.000 align:start position:0%
certainly something that we would take
 
01:21:35.149 --> 01:21:35.159 align:start position:0%
an interest in uh we'd like to obviously
 
01:21:37.370 --> 01:21:37.380 align:start position:0%
see the specific language before you
 
01:21:39.530 --> 01:21:39.540 align:start position:0%
know weighing into too much but this is
 
01:21:41.630 --> 01:21:41.640 align:start position:0%
something that we've discussed
 
01:21:45.169 --> 01:21:45.179 align:start position:0%
uh internally and the points that
 
01:21:48.169 --> 01:21:48.179 align:start position:0%
representative McConkey made are
 
01:21:52.070 --> 01:21:52.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:54.590 --> 01:21:54.600 align:start position:0%
yeah and I think uh unlike uh
 
01:21:56.330 --> 01:21:56.340 align:start position:0%
representative McConkey I've been
 
01:21:58.250 --> 01:21:58.260 align:start position:0%
involved in well I've been at the state
 
01:22:01.130 --> 01:22:01.140 align:start position:0%
for 50 years so you can imagine
 
01:22:03.350 --> 01:22:03.360 align:start position:0%
um I was there basically the beginning
 
01:22:06.590 --> 01:22:06.600 align:start position:0%
of septic systems so I've seen that as
 
01:22:08.570 --> 01:22:08.580 align:start position:0%
it's grown I've seen as we've looked at
 
01:22:11.270 --> 01:22:11.280 align:start position:0%
Innovative Technologies and I would
 
01:22:13.490 --> 01:22:13.500 align:start position:0%
agree with representative McConkey that
 
01:22:16.010 --> 01:22:16.020 align:start position:0%
you know unfortunately Des has no money
 
01:22:18.830 --> 01:22:18.840 align:start position:0%
and has never been able to budget for r
 
01:22:21.530 --> 01:22:21.540 align:start position:0%
d work and I think the suggestions that
 
01:22:23.630 --> 01:22:23.640 align:start position:0%
representative McConkey made sense you
 
01:22:25.010 --> 01:22:25.020 align:start position:0%
know it would be nice if we had staff
 
01:22:29.149 --> 01:22:29.159 align:start position:0%
available to do some r d work sample
 
01:22:31.370 --> 01:22:31.380 align:start position:0%
monitoring see what we've permitted
 
01:22:34.189 --> 01:22:34.199 align:start position:0%
innovatively and see if in fact it is
 
01:22:36.110 --> 01:22:36.120 align:start position:0%
effective what you have to keep in mind
 
01:22:37.910 --> 01:22:37.920 align:start position:0%
is when you're talking about Wastewater
 
01:22:39.890 --> 01:22:39.900 align:start position:0%
loading or
 
01:22:42.250 --> 01:22:42.260 align:start position:0%
site learning that you're talking about
 
01:22:45.470 --> 01:22:45.480 align:start position:0%
over the years you know 65 percent of
 
01:22:46.669 --> 01:22:46.679 align:start position:0%
the state when you look at the
 
01:22:48.590 --> 01:22:48.600 align:start position:0%
populations on Municipal Water and
 
01:22:51.530 --> 01:22:51.540 align:start position:0%
Wastewater the other fit 45 50 percent
 
01:22:54.649 --> 01:22:54.659 align:start position:0%
are on septic systems historically based
 
01:22:57.229 --> 01:22:57.239 align:start position:0%
on a lot sizes and our loading based on
 
01:23:00.890 --> 01:23:00.900 align:start position:0%
150 gallons per day albeit in some cases
 
01:23:04.610 --> 01:23:04.620 align:start position:0%
is conservative in my career I have
 
01:23:07.070 --> 01:23:07.080 align:start position:0%
never seen a Bedrock well that's been
 
01:23:09.890 --> 01:23:09.900 align:start position:0%
polluted by an on-site sepsis system so
 
01:23:12.169 --> 01:23:12.179 align:start position:0%
one can come to two conclusions out of
 
01:23:15.530 --> 01:23:15.540 align:start position:0%
that that one that the soil is being
 
01:23:17.990 --> 01:23:18.000 align:start position:0%
effective and efficient or number two
 
01:23:22.250 --> 01:23:22.260 align:start position:0%
that uh hydraulic loading 150 gallons
 
01:23:25.430 --> 01:23:25.440 align:start position:0%
per day per bedroom has been albeit on
 
01:23:27.010 --> 01:23:27.020 align:start position:0%
its faces
 
01:23:29.930 --> 01:23:29.940 align:start position:0%
conservative seems to be doing the job
 
01:23:32.689 --> 01:23:32.699 align:start position:0%
as you may or may not know most sites
 
01:23:35.149 --> 01:23:35.159 align:start position:0%
whether you're looking at a two-bedroom
 
01:23:37.209 --> 01:23:37.219 align:start position:0%
house three-bedroom four-bedroom house
 
01:23:40.510 --> 01:23:40.520 align:start position:0%
based on the soil's capability that
 
01:23:44.330 --> 01:23:44.340 align:start position:0%
actively renovate the Wastewater and on
 
01:23:45.830 --> 01:23:45.840 align:start position:0%
that site you probably have an
 
01:23:48.770 --> 01:23:48.780 align:start position:0%
individual well where you subtract that
 
01:23:52.130 --> 01:23:52.140 align:start position:0%
radius so you have enough movement in
 
01:23:54.169 --> 01:23:54.179 align:start position:0%
the groundwater for that to be treated
 
01:23:56.330 --> 01:23:56.340 align:start position:0%
before it gets to the well
 
01:24:01.010 --> 01:24:01.020 align:start position:0%
so albeit I think it it may be time to
 
01:24:05.149 --> 01:24:05.159 align:start position:0%
think about per gallons per day use for
 
01:24:07.910 --> 01:24:07.920 align:start position:0%
whatever the facility is I think I want
 
01:24:10.250 --> 01:24:10.260 align:start position:0%
to caution the committee that what we're
 
01:24:12.890 --> 01:24:12.900 align:start position:0%
seeing now is increased failures and I
 
01:24:14.810 --> 01:24:14.820 align:start position:0%
think representative McConkey mentioned
 
01:24:18.890 --> 01:24:18.900 align:start position:0%
that and today the world has changed you
 
01:24:20.750 --> 01:24:20.760 align:start position:0%
know we've got a lot more people moving
 
01:24:23.870 --> 01:24:23.880 align:start position:0%
back into homes we've got multiple uses
 
01:24:26.870 --> 01:24:26.880 align:start position:0%
now the two people living in a
 
01:24:28.850 --> 01:24:28.860 align:start position:0%
three-bedroom house has now gone back to
 
01:24:32.390 --> 01:24:32.400 align:start position:0%
four five six we're seeing a result of
 
01:24:35.090 --> 01:24:35.100 align:start position:0%
the the increase in the number of failed
 
01:24:37.149 --> 01:24:37.159 align:start position:0%
septic systems over the last two years
 
01:24:40.850 --> 01:24:40.860 align:start position:0%
more so than what we've seen in the past
 
01:24:44.390 --> 01:24:44.400 align:start position:0%
I think a lot of that's done to what we
 
01:24:47.270 --> 01:24:47.280 align:start position:0%
call overloaded hydraulically there's
 
01:24:49.430 --> 01:24:49.440 align:start position:0%
more flows going into the systems that
 
01:24:52.130 --> 01:24:52.140 align:start position:0%
they perhaps in many cases were designed
 
01:24:55.189 --> 01:24:55.199 align:start position:0%
to so my caution would be that we walk
 
01:24:57.530 --> 01:24:57.540 align:start position:0%
before we run and think about the
 
01:25:00.290 --> 01:25:00.300 align:start position:0%
concepts I think what representative
 
01:25:03.470 --> 01:25:03.480 align:start position:0%
McConkey talked on the stone and pipe I
 
01:25:05.630 --> 01:25:05.640 align:start position:0%
think it's time that we look at two feet
 
01:25:07.610 --> 01:25:07.620 align:start position:0%
above seasonal high water table for that
 
01:25:11.030 --> 01:25:11.040 align:start position:0%
it's it makes sense being in the
 
01:25:13.010 --> 01:25:13.020 align:start position:0%
business as long as I've been what's
 
01:25:14.990 --> 01:25:15.000 align:start position:0%
actively doing a lot of the work on an
 
01:25:17.090 --> 01:25:17.100 align:start position:0%
on-site Wastewater system is the sand
 
01:25:19.250 --> 01:25:19.260 align:start position:0%
beneath whatever that
 
01:25:21.890 --> 01:25:21.900 align:start position:0%
system is designed to be whether it be
 
01:25:23.810 --> 01:25:23.820 align:start position:0%
an Innovative technology or whether it
 
01:25:26.149 --> 01:25:26.159 align:start position:0%
be Stone and pipe so I mean I think
 
01:25:28.250 --> 01:25:28.260 align:start position:0%
that's something right as I sit here
 
01:25:29.930 --> 01:25:29.940 align:start position:0%
today we would certainly actively
 
01:25:32.689 --> 01:25:32.699 align:start position:0%
support it makes a lot of sense we have
 
01:25:35.390 --> 01:25:35.400 align:start position:0%
used sand as treatment for drinking
 
01:25:38.209 --> 01:25:38.219 align:start position:0%
water for years and years and years it's
 
01:25:40.010 --> 01:25:40.020 align:start position:0%
an effective media and it does a pretty
 
01:25:43.490 --> 01:25:43.500 align:start position:0%
good job so I certainly would commit
 
01:25:45.970 --> 01:25:45.980 align:start position:0%
today that we we can
 
01:25:48.470 --> 01:25:48.480 align:start position:0%
clearly support that kind of concept
 
01:25:50.030 --> 01:25:50.040 align:start position:0%
because I think it makes a lot of sense
 
01:25:53.149 --> 01:25:53.159 align:start position:0%
and it has probably for many years but I
 
01:25:55.310 --> 01:25:55.320 align:start position:0%
guess the rest of it be interested to
 
01:25:56.930 --> 01:25:56.940 align:start position:0%
see what the formal or the final
 
01:25:58.550 --> 01:25:58.560 align:start position:0%
language looks like of the draft
 
01:26:02.090 --> 01:26:02.100 align:start position:0%
language and if it's something that that
 
01:26:04.370 --> 01:26:04.380 align:start position:0%
makes sense with our experience over
 
01:26:06.709 --> 01:26:06.719 align:start position:0%
time then I think we certainly would be
 
01:26:09.169 --> 01:26:09.179 align:start position:0%
willing to comment or participate or
 
01:26:12.470 --> 01:26:12.480 align:start position:0%
whatever but you know we're we're not
 
01:26:14.990 --> 01:26:15.000 align:start position:0%
ever against change you know I think
 
01:26:16.790 --> 01:26:16.800 align:start position:0%
it's just got to be methodical and it's
 
01:26:19.250 --> 01:26:19.260 align:start position:0%
going to be scientifically based and uh
 
01:26:22.550 --> 01:26:22.560 align:start position:0%
if those two things meet the criteria I
 
01:26:25.970 --> 01:26:25.980 align:start position:0%
say we all move forward makes sense
 
01:26:28.510 --> 01:26:28.520 align:start position:0%
great I mean I'm looking at
 
01:26:32.390 --> 01:26:32.400 align:start position:0%
thousands of of dollars saved per system
 
01:26:34.930 --> 01:26:34.940 align:start position:0%
is going to be a huge huge huge
 
01:26:37.490 --> 01:26:37.500 align:start position:0%
alleviation for developers especially if
 
01:26:39.410 --> 01:26:39.420 align:start position:0%
they're building large properties so
 
01:26:40.970 --> 01:26:40.980 align:start position:0%
thank you for helping us buy in and I
 
01:26:42.290 --> 01:26:42.300 align:start position:0%
have commitment from the speaker that
 
01:26:43.970 --> 01:26:43.980 align:start position:0%
these bills are going to come to our
 
01:26:46.250 --> 01:26:46.260 align:start position:0%
committee so we're going to be able to
 
01:26:48.350 --> 01:26:48.360 align:start position:0%
um continue this conversation so we will
 
01:26:50.330 --> 01:26:50.340 align:start position:0%
definitely see you back for this
 
01:26:50.340 --> 01:26:52.490 align:start position:0%
definitely see you back for this
representative

01:26:52.490 --> 01:26:52.500 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:26:54.229 --> 01:26:54.239 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:26:57.229 --> 01:26:57.239 align:start position:0%
um are you familiar with the
 
01:26:58.790 --> 01:26:58.800 align:start position:0%
um these
 
01:27:02.629 --> 01:27:02.639 align:start position:0%
uh 2003 soil based lot sizing
 
01:27:08.209 --> 01:27:08.219 align:start position:0%
um report that was mentioned and uh
 
01:27:10.850 --> 01:27:10.860 align:start position:0%
referenced in in representative
 
01:27:13.510 --> 01:27:13.520 align:start position:0%
mcconkey's uh
 
01:27:15.890 --> 01:27:15.900 align:start position:0%
statement and
 
01:27:19.910 --> 01:27:19.920 align:start position:0%
um and specifically about their
 
01:27:23.330 --> 01:27:23.340 align:start position:0%
um in that there is some suggestions
 
01:27:27.189 --> 01:27:27.199 align:start position:0%
based on soil type of the the
 
01:27:31.070 --> 01:27:31.080 align:start position:0%
recommended minimum lot sizes
 
01:27:34.550 --> 01:27:34.560 align:start position:0%
um are you familiar with those what are
 
01:27:34.560 --> 01:27:35.470 align:start position:0%
um are you familiar with those what are
your

01:27:35.470 --> 01:27:35.480 align:start position:0%
your
 
01:27:40.070 --> 01:27:40.080 align:start position:0%
thoughts on them if any and um does the
 
01:27:44.149 --> 01:27:44.159 align:start position:0%
department have some of their own kind
 
01:27:49.189 --> 01:27:49.199 align:start position:0%
of like uh maybe requirements for a lot
 
01:27:52.970 --> 01:27:52.980 align:start position:0%
um that let's say services like has
 
01:27:52.980 --> 01:27:54.050 align:start position:0%
um that let's say services like has
um

01:27:54.050 --> 01:27:54.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:27:57.470 --> 01:27:57.480 align:start position:0%
uh it's its requirements
 
01:28:01.129 --> 01:28:01.139 align:start position:0%
um based on soil type of let's say A you
 
01:28:04.910 --> 01:28:04.920 align:start position:0%
know a septic and water system
 
01:28:07.970 --> 01:28:07.980 align:start position:0%
um for uh residential
 
01:28:10.970 --> 01:28:10.980 align:start position:0%
do they have do you guys have some like
 
01:28:13.610 --> 01:28:13.620 align:start position:0%
uh maybe a chart that says you know you
 
01:28:15.290 --> 01:28:15.300 align:start position:0%
you're going to need this much land to
 
01:28:17.510 --> 01:28:17.520 align:start position:0%
be able to fulfill our requirements or
 
01:28:18.830 --> 01:28:18.840 align:start position:0%
something like that
 
01:28:20.030 --> 01:28:20.040 align:start position:0%
um that you could provide the committee
 
01:28:20.040 --> 01:28:22.070 align:start position:0%
um that you could provide the committee
thanks

01:28:22.070 --> 01:28:22.080 align:start position:0%
thanks
 
01:28:23.990 --> 01:28:24.000 align:start position:0%
thank you representative yukela I can I
 
01:28:26.689 --> 01:28:26.699 align:start position:0%
can answer your question yes we in fact
 
01:28:29.390 --> 01:28:29.400 align:start position:0%
have uh exactly the chart that you're
 
01:28:32.930 --> 01:28:32.940 align:start position:0%
asking for that establishes the the size
 
01:28:35.750 --> 01:28:35.760 align:start position:0%
of or the area of land needed to treat
 
01:28:37.970 --> 01:28:37.980 align:start position:0%
the waste based on the soil type the
 
01:28:40.310 --> 01:28:40.320 align:start position:0%
slope of the land and then also you have
 
01:28:42.470 --> 01:28:42.480 align:start position:0%
to cut out uh you know the area the
 
01:28:44.510 --> 01:28:44.520 align:start position:0%
radius around of drinking water well or
 
01:28:46.910 --> 01:28:46.920 align:start position:0%
Wetland areas and that tells you you
 
01:28:49.430 --> 01:28:49.440 align:start position:0%
know the how much treatable soil or soil
 
01:28:51.770 --> 01:28:51.780 align:start position:0%
for treatment you have on your lot
 
01:28:56.149 --> 01:28:56.159 align:start position:0%
um we the um the 2003 report that
 
01:28:58.250 --> 01:28:58.260 align:start position:0%
representative McConkey mentioned
 
01:29:01.189 --> 01:29:01.199 align:start position:0%
provided a table like this related to
 
01:29:03.709 --> 01:29:03.719 align:start position:0%
soil type and slope and provided these
 
01:29:06.110 --> 01:29:06.120 align:start position:0%
certain minimum areas for treatment
 
01:29:08.209 --> 01:29:08.219 align:start position:0%
we have the exact same table in our
 
01:29:11.689 --> 01:29:11.699 align:start position:0%
regulations and our our areas are almost
 
01:29:14.149 --> 01:29:14.159 align:start position:0%
the same they're a little bit uh smaller
 
01:29:16.189 --> 01:29:16.199 align:start position:0%
so it's a little bit less restrictive
 
01:29:18.169 --> 01:29:18.179 align:start position:0%
but they are you know within five
 
01:29:20.930 --> 01:29:20.940 align:start position:0%
percent of each other so um we're very
 
01:29:22.910 --> 01:29:22.920 align:start position:0%
much in line with the recommendations
 
01:29:25.070 --> 01:29:25.080 align:start position:0%
from the soil scientists
 
01:29:27.830 --> 01:29:27.840 align:start position:0%
and one of the things I like to mention
 
01:29:29.570 --> 01:29:29.580 align:start position:0%
when talking about septic systems and
 
01:29:29.580 --> 01:29:30.590 align:start position:0%
when talking about septic systems and
housing

01:29:30.590 --> 01:29:30.600 align:start position:0%
housing
 
01:29:34.430 --> 01:29:34.440 align:start position:0%
um is geology is Destiny right the
 
01:29:37.310 --> 01:29:37.320 align:start position:0%
ability to put houses on land depends on
 
01:29:40.550 --> 01:29:40.560 align:start position:0%
the type of property you have uh how how
 
01:29:43.310 --> 01:29:43.320 align:start position:0%
type of soil you have how deep you are
 
01:29:46.010 --> 01:29:46.020 align:start position:0%
to bedrock how much Wetland you have
 
01:29:50.810 --> 01:29:50.820 align:start position:0%
Etc uh so um the same size Lots can
 
01:29:52.970 --> 01:29:52.980 align:start position:0%
handle different amounts of housing
 
01:29:56.270 --> 01:29:56.280 align:start position:0%
units depending on the geology of it and
 
01:29:59.629 --> 01:29:59.639 align:start position:0%
we do those calculations or developers
 
01:30:01.370 --> 01:30:01.380 align:start position:0%
do those calculations then submit submit
 
01:30:03.169 --> 01:30:03.179 align:start position:0%
to us for review when they are
 
01:30:05.090 --> 01:30:05.100 align:start position:0%
subdividing properties or they are
 
01:30:06.890 --> 01:30:06.900 align:start position:0%
developing them and that's a very well
 
01:30:08.450 --> 01:30:08.460 align:start position:0%
established process already in
 
01:30:11.870 --> 01:30:11.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:16.310 --> 01:30:16.320 align:start position:0%
bye are you aware of any municipalities
 
01:30:18.890 --> 01:30:18.900 align:start position:0%
that are using
 
01:30:18.900 --> 01:30:20.410 align:start position:0%
that are using
um

01:30:20.410 --> 01:30:20.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:30:23.270 --> 01:30:23.280 align:start position:0%
those suggestions
 
01:30:25.790 --> 01:30:25.800 align:start position:0%
um and basing their
 
01:30:29.090 --> 01:30:29.100 align:start position:0%
um their minimum lot sizes much in the
 
01:30:32.149 --> 01:30:32.159 align:start position:0%
same way that you suggest or have that
 
01:30:34.790 --> 01:30:34.800 align:start position:0%
have those suggestions been pretty much
 
01:30:37.250 --> 01:30:37.260 align:start position:0%
like pushed to the Wayside and and
 
01:30:39.169 --> 01:30:39.179 align:start position:0%
they've gone their own path in your
 
01:30:39.179 --> 01:30:42.350 align:start position:0%
they've gone their own path in your
experience

01:30:42.350 --> 01:30:42.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:45.169 --> 01:30:45.179 align:start position:0%
yeah I think as as you're you're all
 
01:30:47.629 --> 01:30:47.639 align:start position:0%
aware municipalities have the ability to
 
01:30:49.970 --> 01:30:49.980 align:start position:0%
be more strict than Des but it can't be
 
01:30:53.510 --> 01:30:53.520 align:start position:0%
less more lenient I think there's two
 
01:30:55.790 --> 01:30:55.800 align:start position:0%
facets that I've seen in my career that
 
01:30:59.149 --> 01:30:59.159 align:start position:0%
regulate lot sizes and what's developed
 
01:31:02.149 --> 01:31:02.159 align:start position:0%
in town some are scientifically based
 
01:31:04.790 --> 01:31:04.800 align:start position:0%
and they look to conscribe to what we do
 
01:31:06.669 --> 01:31:06.679 align:start position:0%
for light a lot of them are just social
 
01:31:08.990 --> 01:31:09.000 align:start position:0%
implications a lot of times they just
 
01:31:11.090 --> 01:31:11.100 align:start position:0%
want to wake as a zoning that's the way
 
01:31:13.129 --> 01:31:13.139 align:start position:0%
they want their town to look like you
 
01:31:14.810 --> 01:31:14.820 align:start position:0%
know and if the vote is weigh in on that
 
01:31:16.250 --> 01:31:16.260 align:start position:0%
and that's what the people who live
 
01:31:18.830 --> 01:31:18.840 align:start position:0%
there choosing so be it that's something
 
01:31:20.870 --> 01:31:20.880 align:start position:0%
that we don't have regulatory authority
 
01:31:23.890 --> 01:31:23.900 align:start position:0%
over but I think it the common sense
 
01:31:27.530 --> 01:31:27.540 align:start position:0%
that we've utilized over certainly many
 
01:31:30.050 --> 01:31:30.060 align:start position:0%
years is is that
 
01:31:32.629 --> 01:31:32.639 align:start position:0%
we we try and stay away from the social
 
01:31:34.790 --> 01:31:34.800 align:start position:0%
implications all we want to do is make
 
01:31:36.590 --> 01:31:36.600 align:start position:0%
sure that if someone develops a site
 
01:31:38.510 --> 01:31:38.520 align:start position:0%
whether it be commercial residential
 
01:31:42.050 --> 01:31:42.060 align:start position:0%
condos that this sustainability so
 
01:31:43.669 --> 01:31:43.679 align:start position:0%
they're going to have portable drinking
 
01:31:46.330 --> 01:31:46.340 align:start position:0%
water for the for the life of that site
 
01:31:50.450 --> 01:31:50.460 align:start position:0%
and also we won't be generating waste
 
01:31:54.169 --> 01:31:54.179 align:start position:0%
that isn't treated so it in it is an
 
01:31:56.510 --> 01:31:56.520 align:start position:0%
encroachment on a rivers lakes and ponds
 
01:31:59.870 --> 01:31:59.880 align:start position:0%
so that's that's kind of where we stay
 
01:32:02.209 --> 01:32:02.219 align:start position:0%
we stay out of the social implications
 
01:32:05.050 --> 01:32:05.060 align:start position:0%
we look at the scientific
 
01:32:09.770 --> 01:32:09.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:11.810 --> 01:32:11.820 align:start position:0%
thank you you mentioned that you're you
 
01:32:13.729 --> 01:32:13.739 align:start position:0%
had these suggestions in your
 
01:32:15.709 --> 01:32:15.719 align:start position:0%
regulations do you happen to know the
 
01:32:18.709 --> 01:32:18.719 align:start position:0%
regulation or could you provide a copy
 
01:32:21.110 --> 01:32:21.120 align:start position:0%
of that to the to the committee
 
01:32:22.250 --> 01:32:22.260 align:start position:0%
um offhand
 
01:32:23.629 --> 01:32:23.639 align:start position:0%
sure well
 
01:32:26.209 --> 01:32:26.219 align:start position:0%
um yeah so the the minimum lot size is
 
01:32:29.470 --> 01:32:29.480 align:start position:0%
it's in the subsurface rules which is
 
01:32:33.229 --> 01:32:33.239 align:start position:0%
envwq 1005.
 
01:32:35.510 --> 01:32:35.520 align:start position:0%
and you'll see in that section there's a
 
01:32:38.510 --> 01:32:38.520 align:start position:0%
table it's 1005-1
 
01:32:40.729 --> 01:32:40.739 align:start position:0%
and that has that chart
 
01:32:40.739 --> 01:32:43.970 align:start position:0%
and that has that chart
okay

01:32:43.970 --> 01:32:43.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:47.050 --> 01:32:47.060 align:start position:0%
okay can I get your feedback on the bill
 
01:32:49.669 --> 01:32:49.679 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
01:32:51.770 --> 01:32:51.780 align:start position:0%
the the language that I added to that
 
01:32:51.780 --> 01:32:53.450 align:start position:0%
the the language that I added to that
the

01:32:53.450 --> 01:32:53.460 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:32:54.950 --> 01:32:54.960 align:start position:0%
the structure of the housing appeals
 
01:33:00.470 --> 01:33:00.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:02.450 --> 01:33:02.460 align:start position:0%
all right I'll start out and then all
 
01:33:05.810 --> 01:33:05.820 align:start position:0%
right the the one thing I would just uh
 
01:33:08.390 --> 01:33:08.400 align:start position:0%
want to mention is there is also a
 
01:33:11.510 --> 01:33:11.520 align:start position:0%
separate appeals board for Des decisions
 
01:33:14.689 --> 01:33:14.699 align:start position:0%
uh there's the wetlands Council uh
 
01:33:17.390 --> 01:33:17.400 align:start position:0%
there's so many appeal Sports yeah and
 
01:33:19.070 --> 01:33:19.080 align:start position:0%
there's also a Waters Council water
 
01:33:20.870 --> 01:33:20.880 align:start position:0%
Council which here's appeals related to
 
01:33:23.450 --> 01:33:23.460 align:start position:0%
subsurface decisions so the same
 
01:33:26.030 --> 01:33:26.040 align:start position:0%
questions that came up as to
 
01:33:28.430 --> 01:33:28.440 align:start position:0%
you know which appeals board they might
 
01:33:29.870 --> 01:33:29.880 align:start position:0%
go through
 
01:33:31.490 --> 01:33:31.500 align:start position:0%
um I would have those same questions
 
01:33:34.850 --> 01:33:34.860 align:start position:0%
about your proposal
 
01:33:37.430 --> 01:33:37.440 align:start position:0%
um the wetlands Council has the full
 
01:33:39.890 --> 01:33:39.900 align:start position:0%
authority to reverse or remand a
 
01:33:41.990 --> 01:33:42.000 align:start position:0%
decision by the department
 
01:33:45.169 --> 01:33:45.179 align:start position:0%
if someone if the
 
01:33:47.270 --> 01:33:47.280 align:start position:0%
um the decisions of the council can be
 
01:33:50.810 --> 01:33:50.820 align:start position:0%
then appealed to Superior Supreme Court
 
01:33:53.330 --> 01:33:53.340 align:start position:0%
um so um you know there already is a
 
01:33:55.490 --> 01:33:55.500 align:start position:0%
pretty strict process and and pretty
 
01:33:58.610 --> 01:33:58.620 align:start position:0%
fast timelines for appealing on a
 
01:34:00.290 --> 01:34:00.300 align:start position:0%
decision by the department either on a
 
01:34:03.350 --> 01:34:03.360 align:start position:0%
Wetlands an alteration of terrain or a
 
01:34:05.030 --> 01:34:05.040 align:start position:0%
subsurface decision
 
01:34:07.790 --> 01:34:07.800 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
01:34:10.250 --> 01:34:10.260 align:start position:0%
all right anybody else for Des
 
01:34:13.010 --> 01:34:13.020 align:start position:0%
thank you very much much appreciated and
 
01:34:14.750 --> 01:34:14.760 align:start position:0%
thank you representative McConkey on for
 
01:34:18.290 --> 01:34:18.300 align:start position:0%
taking the lead on this uh so moving
 
01:34:20.390 --> 01:34:20.400 align:start position:0%
forward I'm gonna have you send us
 
01:34:22.310 --> 01:34:22.320 align:start position:0%
hopefully some legislation the next week
 
01:34:24.830 --> 01:34:24.840 align:start position:0%
or so so we can look into this and um
 
01:34:26.629 --> 01:34:26.639 align:start position:0%
get this proposed for this year yes
 
01:34:28.669 --> 01:34:28.679 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
01:34:31.970 --> 01:34:31.980 align:start position:0%
okay uh the next one I have I'm going to
 
01:34:34.550 --> 01:34:34.560 align:start position:0%
dive into impact fees
 
01:34:36.410 --> 01:34:36.420 align:start position:0%
um so this is
 
01:34:39.410 --> 01:34:39.420 align:start position:0%
hopefully going to
 
01:34:42.590 --> 01:34:42.600 align:start position:0%
um give more flexibility to developers
 
01:34:44.990 --> 01:34:45.000 align:start position:0%
to negotiate and impact fee schedule and
 
01:34:46.910 --> 01:34:46.920 align:start position:0%
municipalities to hold on to back piece
 
01:34:49.250 --> 01:34:49.260 align:start position:0%
for longer does everyone have the paper
 
01:34:52.370 --> 01:34:52.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:53.930 --> 01:34:53.940 align:start position:0%
perfect so
 
01:34:56.810 --> 01:34:56.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:59.090 --> 01:34:59.100 align:start position:0%
here I have another one
 
01:35:01.850 --> 01:35:01.860 align:start position:0%
it's on the table as well this would it
 
01:35:01.860 --> 01:35:03.229 align:start position:0%
it's on the table as well this would it
makes

01:35:03.229 --> 01:35:03.239 align:start position:0%
makes
 
01:35:05.570 --> 01:35:05.580 align:start position:0%
two it makes a small change it basically
 
01:35:07.610 --> 01:35:07.620 align:start position:0%
allows the municipality to hold on to
 
01:35:10.129 --> 01:35:10.139 align:start position:0%
impact fees from six years to ten years
 
01:35:12.350 --> 01:35:12.360 align:start position:0%
um it allows
 
01:35:14.450 --> 01:35:14.460 align:start position:0%
further negotiation between a developer
 
01:35:16.490 --> 01:35:16.500 align:start position:0%
and municipalities and more flexibility
 
01:35:19.149 --> 01:35:19.159 align:start position:0%
so this is something we heard from
 
01:35:21.709 --> 01:35:21.719 align:start position:0%
developers and from municipalities I
 
01:35:23.090 --> 01:35:23.100 align:start position:0%
believe the city of Manchester came in
 
01:35:24.709 --> 01:35:24.719 align:start position:0%
planning department and said for
 
01:35:26.149 --> 01:35:26.159 align:start position:0%
development that takes more than six
 
01:35:28.310 --> 01:35:28.320 align:start position:0%
years we'd like the ability
 
01:35:29.870 --> 01:35:29.880 align:start position:0%
um to hold on to these fees a little
 
01:35:32.689 --> 01:35:32.699 align:start position:0%
longer to allow more flexibility so uh
 
01:35:34.550 --> 01:35:34.560 align:start position:0%
with that I'll take questions from the
 
01:35:35.810 --> 01:35:35.820 align:start position:0%
committee but I feel like this is pretty
 
01:35:37.610 --> 01:35:37.620 align:start position:0%
straightforward this one
 
01:35:37.620 --> 01:35:38.209 align:start position:0%
straightforward this one
um

01:35:38.209 --> 01:35:38.219 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:35:41.330 --> 01:35:41.340 align:start position:0%
is hopefully a low hanging fruit go
 
01:35:44.330 --> 01:35:44.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:46.430 --> 01:35:46.440 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr
 
01:35:46.440 --> 01:35:47.090 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr
um

01:35:47.090 --> 01:35:47.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:35:49.790 --> 01:35:49.800 align:start position:0%
I just have a question about the the
 
01:35:53.149 --> 01:35:53.159 align:start position:0%
change about the um
 
01:35:56.930 --> 01:35:56.940 align:start position:0%
the refund gets paid to the
 
01:35:56.940 --> 01:36:00.649 align:start position:0%
the refund gets paid to the
um

01:36:00.649 --> 01:36:00.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:03.350 --> 01:36:03.360 align:start position:0%
the one the one who owns that the payer
 
01:36:06.229 --> 01:36:06.239 align:start position:0%
or the pay successor and interest is is
 
01:36:08.570 --> 01:36:08.580 align:start position:0%
there additional language that should be
 
01:36:11.870 --> 01:36:11.880 align:start position:0%
in Brackets so that or is is
 
01:36:14.090 --> 01:36:14.100 align:start position:0%
is the actual current language shall be
 
01:36:16.010 --> 01:36:16.020 align:start position:0%
made to the payers pay successor of
 
01:36:19.610 --> 01:36:19.620 align:start position:0%
Interest then current property owner
 
01:36:21.770 --> 01:36:21.780 align:start position:0%
this is this would be the changes so
 
01:36:23.990 --> 01:36:24.000 align:start position:0%
this is an OLS that drafted this this is
 
01:36:26.990 --> 01:36:27.000 align:start position:0%
uh right is in current language the then
 
01:36:31.129 --> 01:36:31.139 align:start position:0%
current property owner actually in in
 
01:36:33.350 --> 01:36:33.360 align:start position:0%
the no it's repair pays successor and
 
01:36:35.870 --> 01:36:35.880 align:start position:0%
interest that would get scratched
 
01:36:38.450 --> 01:36:38.460 align:start position:0%
and it would be replaced with then
 
01:36:41.629 --> 01:36:41.639 align:start position:0%
current property owner okay so it would
 
01:36:43.669 --> 01:36:43.679 align:start position:0%
have been yeah like a bracket around
 
01:36:46.669 --> 01:36:46.679 align:start position:0%
that would have yes or bold or something
 
01:36:48.350 --> 01:36:48.360 align:start position:0%
um okay
 
01:36:48.360 --> 01:36:50.750 align:start position:0%
um okay
so

01:36:50.750 --> 01:36:50.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:36:53.810 --> 01:36:53.820 align:start position:0%
I'm just wondering about the effects of
 
01:36:56.629 --> 01:36:56.639 align:start position:0%
switching from the person that paid in
 
01:36:58.910 --> 01:36:58.920 align:start position:0%
the money getting refunded the money
 
01:37:02.750 --> 01:37:02.760 align:start position:0%
versus whoever paid in the money now
 
01:37:07.250 --> 01:37:07.260 align:start position:0%
sold that to someone else
 
01:37:09.530 --> 01:37:09.540 align:start position:0%
um and then that person is going to get
 
01:37:12.229 --> 01:37:12.239 align:start position:0%
the refund I'm just wondering about is
 
01:37:17.270 --> 01:37:17.280 align:start position:0%
in all is this change because right now
 
01:37:20.450 --> 01:37:20.460 align:start position:0%
it's hard for the
 
01:37:23.030 --> 01:37:23.040 align:start position:0%
um those people that are buying the
 
01:37:25.550 --> 01:37:25.560 align:start position:0%
property to
 
01:37:29.270 --> 01:37:29.280 align:start position:0%
um like take over the
 
01:37:32.149 --> 01:37:32.159 align:start position:0%
ownership of those improvements or or
 
01:37:34.070 --> 01:37:34.080 align:start position:0%
something like that or that those when
 
01:37:36.410 --> 01:37:36.420 align:start position:0%
they buy the property they're required
 
01:37:36.420 --> 01:37:38.810 align:start position:0%
they buy the property they're required
to

01:37:38.810 --> 01:37:38.820 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:37:41.450 --> 01:37:41.460 align:start position:0%
um like I don't understand why this
 
01:37:43.310 --> 01:37:43.320 align:start position:0%
change needs to happen and what are the
 
01:37:45.970 --> 01:37:45.980 align:start position:0%
what are the like
 
01:37:50.030 --> 01:37:50.040 align:start position:0%
negative consequences that could be
 
01:37:50.040 --> 01:37:51.410 align:start position:0%
negative consequences that could be
um

01:37:51.410 --> 01:37:51.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:37:54.830 --> 01:37:54.840 align:start position:0%
occur because like we have this setup of
 
01:37:57.709 --> 01:37:57.719 align:start position:0%
of you know the developer paid in the
 
01:38:01.610 --> 01:38:01.620 align:start position:0%
money and they expected that money and
 
01:38:04.430 --> 01:38:04.440 align:start position:0%
that went into the cost of the the
 
01:38:07.310 --> 01:38:07.320 align:start position:0%
development or whatever and now
 
01:38:07.320 --> 01:38:08.090 align:start position:0%
development or whatever and now
um

01:38:08.090 --> 01:38:08.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:38:10.550 --> 01:38:10.560 align:start position:0%
they're expecting to get that money back
 
01:38:13.430 --> 01:38:13.440 align:start position:0%
but and so maybe they're not including
 
01:38:14.750 --> 01:38:14.760 align:start position:0%
that in the cost of the development
 
01:38:17.090 --> 01:38:17.100 align:start position:0%
right now but then they are and so can
 
01:38:18.530 --> 01:38:18.540 align:start position:0%
you kind of explain to answer your
 
01:38:19.910 --> 01:38:19.920 align:start position:0%
question there's there's really nothing
 
01:38:21.890 --> 01:38:21.900 align:start position:0%
stopping a developer and municipality to
 
01:38:24.169 --> 01:38:24.179 align:start position:0%
have a contract and there's nothing
 
01:38:25.790 --> 01:38:25.800 align:start position:0%
stopping a contract happening between
 
01:38:28.250 --> 01:38:28.260 align:start position:0%
the developer who paid the impact fees
 
01:38:31.070 --> 01:38:31.080 align:start position:0%
and the person they sold it to to
 
01:38:32.629 --> 01:38:32.639 align:start position:0%
send the money to them there's nothing
 
01:38:36.530 --> 01:38:36.540 align:start position:0%
stopping that the the money would go to
 
01:38:38.810 --> 01:38:38.820 align:start position:0%
the current the current property owner
 
01:38:40.129 --> 01:38:40.139 align:start position:0%
when it was given back and that's only
 
01:38:42.350 --> 01:38:42.360 align:start position:0%
after they sold the property so a lot of
 
01:38:43.550 --> 01:38:43.560 align:start position:0%
times they don't sell the property or
 
01:38:45.350 --> 01:38:45.360 align:start position:0%
the development takes longer than six
 
01:38:47.990 --> 01:38:48.000 align:start position:0%
years they're still holding on to it so
 
01:38:50.810 --> 01:38:50.820 align:start position:0%
um this would just give more flexibility
 
01:38:52.970 --> 01:38:52.980 align:start position:0%
to a municipality who has a a
 
01:38:54.830 --> 01:38:54.840 align:start position:0%
development that takes longer than the
 
01:38:56.870 --> 01:38:56.880 align:start position:0%
six years because that was a that was
 
01:39:00.950 --> 01:39:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:05.270 --> 01:39:05.280 align:start position:0%
yeah follow-up yep I I guess I don't not
 
01:39:07.310 --> 01:39:07.320 align:start position:0%
I I think you're more addressing the six
 
01:39:09.229 --> 01:39:09.239 align:start position:0%
versus ten year thing you're answering
 
01:39:10.790 --> 01:39:10.800 align:start position:0%
that and not really my question my
 
01:39:13.490 --> 01:39:13.500 align:start position:0%
question since it seems like they'll pay
 
01:39:15.770 --> 01:39:15.780 align:start position:0%
your own pay your successor of the in in
 
01:39:18.649 --> 01:39:18.659 align:start position:0%
success or in interest
 
01:39:22.790 --> 01:39:22.800 align:start position:0%
um seems to be like the payer successor
 
01:39:25.189 --> 01:39:25.199 align:start position:0%
and interest may be the successor of
 
01:39:26.870 --> 01:39:26.880 align:start position:0%
interest in the property and therefore
 
01:39:29.209 --> 01:39:29.219 align:start position:0%
is already the person that buys the
 
01:39:32.149 --> 01:39:32.159 align:start position:0%
property afterwards and so changing it
 
01:39:34.850 --> 01:39:34.860 align:start position:0%
to the successor's successor and
 
01:39:36.770 --> 01:39:36.780 align:start position:0%
interest in replacing that with a
 
01:39:38.450 --> 01:39:38.460 align:start position:0%
property owner is essentially just
 
01:39:41.870 --> 01:39:41.880 align:start position:0%
saying the exact same thing again
 
01:39:43.250 --> 01:39:43.260 align:start position:0%
um or
 
01:39:46.250 --> 01:39:46.260 align:start position:0%
are you or
 
01:39:48.950 --> 01:39:48.960 align:start position:0%
if it the payer or the payer's success
 
01:39:51.770 --> 01:39:51.780 align:start position:0%
or if interest it may be the person that
 
01:39:54.830 --> 01:39:54.840 align:start position:0%
paid in the money and then they when
 
01:39:56.570 --> 01:39:56.580 align:start position:0%
they sell as part of the contract they
 
01:39:59.510 --> 01:39:59.520 align:start position:0%
say you're gonna get the refund but now
 
01:40:01.910 --> 01:40:01.920 align:start position:0%
we're saying in law that it's going to
 
01:40:04.970 --> 01:40:04.980 align:start position:0%
go to that person and and essentially
 
01:40:06.950 --> 01:40:06.960 align:start position:0%
barring them from having a contract that
 
01:40:09.050 --> 01:40:09.060 align:start position:0%
says no I'm going to give you a let
 
01:40:11.510 --> 01:40:11.520 align:start position:0%
lower price and I'm gonna get the refund
 
01:40:13.729 --> 01:40:13.739 align:start position:0%
if if those
 
01:40:16.490 --> 01:40:16.500 align:start position:0%
those improvements aren't
 
01:40:18.950 --> 01:40:18.960 align:start position:0%
aren't made and the money isn't used so
 
01:40:21.649 --> 01:40:21.659 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna get that refund it sounds like
 
01:40:24.649 --> 01:40:24.659 align:start position:0%
it's possible that this language is more
 
01:40:27.770 --> 01:40:27.780 align:start position:0%
restrictive than is currently allowed
 
01:40:30.110 --> 01:40:30.120 align:start position:0%
I'm not 100 sure so can you speak to
 
01:40:32.390 --> 01:40:32.400 align:start position:0%
that I'm gonna allow would you like to
 
01:40:33.950 --> 01:40:33.960 align:start position:0%
weigh in Ben and let me know why you
 
01:40:36.410 --> 01:40:36.420 align:start position:0%
include that language I I see where
 
01:40:38.689 --> 01:40:38.699 align:start position:0%
you're coming from with that too
 
01:40:45.890 --> 01:40:45.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:48.169 --> 01:40:48.179 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman Ben Frost from New
 
01:40:50.629 --> 01:40:50.639 align:start position:0%
Hampshire housing I think this is a a
 
01:40:53.209 --> 01:40:53.219 align:start position:0%
really good discussion and it goes
 
01:40:56.689 --> 01:40:56.699 align:start position:0%
back I think it was 2006 when this
 
01:40:59.330 --> 01:40:59.340 align:start position:0%
statute was amended and I have to
 
01:40:59.340 --> 01:41:00.370 align:start position:0%
statute was amended and I have to
confess

01:41:00.370 --> 01:41:00.380 align:start position:0%
confess
 
01:41:04.250 --> 01:41:04.260 align:start position:0%
that the the language pay or or payers
 
01:41:06.770 --> 01:41:06.780 align:start position:0%
success or an interest was language that
 
01:41:09.169 --> 01:41:09.179 align:start position:0%
I drafted way back then and I thought I
 
01:41:11.270 --> 01:41:11.280 align:start position:0%
knew what it meant then
 
01:41:14.229 --> 01:41:14.239 align:start position:0%
but then it was subject to a
 
01:41:18.050 --> 01:41:18.060 align:start position:0%
dispute in Pelham that wound up before
 
01:41:19.729 --> 01:41:19.739 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Supreme Court trying
 
01:41:22.610 --> 01:41:22.620 align:start position:0%
to figure out what that language meant
 
01:41:26.209 --> 01:41:26.219 align:start position:0%
and it was there was ambiguity here uh
 
01:41:29.209 --> 01:41:29.219 align:start position:0%
and I this what is proposed here is an
 
01:41:30.470 --> 01:41:30.480 align:start position:0%
attempt to
 
01:41:32.750 --> 01:41:32.760 align:start position:0%
make it Crystal Clear who gets the money
 
01:41:35.450 --> 01:41:35.460 align:start position:0%
back uh it's a
 
01:41:37.669 --> 01:41:37.679 align:start position:0%
I don't want to say universally but in
 
01:41:40.990 --> 01:41:41.000 align:start position:0%
most cases where an impact fee is paid
 
01:41:43.550 --> 01:41:43.560 align:start position:0%
that becomes a cost of the development
 
01:41:46.550 --> 01:41:46.560 align:start position:0%
and so it gets passed on to whoever the
 
01:41:49.669 --> 01:41:49.679 align:start position:0%
end user is of that property whether it
 
01:41:52.070 --> 01:41:52.080 align:start position:0%
is the developer themselves if they if
 
01:41:54.770 --> 01:41:54.780 align:start position:0%
they retain ownership as my often is in
 
01:41:57.490 --> 01:41:57.500 align:start position:0%
the case with commercial development
 
01:42:00.590 --> 01:42:00.600 align:start position:0%
or in a subdivision it's the property
 
01:42:04.250 --> 01:42:04.260 align:start position:0%
owners in a subdivision so they've in
 
01:42:06.410 --> 01:42:06.420 align:start position:0%
effect that the buyer is in a
 
01:42:08.570 --> 01:42:08.580 align:start position:0%
subdivision have paid the cost of that
 
01:42:10.209 --> 01:42:10.219 align:start position:0%
impact fee
 
01:42:12.770 --> 01:42:12.780 align:start position:0%
so then they should get that money back
 
01:42:15.709 --> 01:42:15.719 align:start position:0%
if it is not used by the municipality
 
01:42:18.470 --> 01:42:18.480 align:start position:0%
so that that's the thinking behind this
 
01:42:20.870 --> 01:42:20.880 align:start position:0%
change and I'll note that this is
 
01:42:22.609 --> 01:42:22.619 align:start position:0%
something that I simply propose to the
 
01:42:24.709 --> 01:42:24.719 align:start position:0%
the chairman of the city of Manchester
 
01:42:27.470 --> 01:42:27.480 align:start position:0%
simply requested the change from six to
 
01:42:28.669 --> 01:42:28.679 align:start position:0%
ten years
 
01:42:30.490 --> 01:42:30.500 align:start position:0%
I will note
 
01:42:35.030 --> 01:42:35.040 align:start position:0%
that as drafted this is incomplete there
 
01:42:37.790 --> 01:42:37.800 align:start position:0%
are two places where this change needs
 
01:42:39.649 --> 01:42:39.659 align:start position:0%
to be made this is
 
01:42:43.430 --> 01:42:43.440 align:start position:0%
um RSA 674 21 5 J
 
01:42:46.010 --> 01:42:46.020 align:start position:0%
deals not with impact fees but with
 
01:42:49.129 --> 01:42:49.139 align:start position:0%
off-site exections in where there is not
 
01:42:50.810 --> 01:42:50.820 align:start position:0%
an impact fee ordinance
 
01:42:54.050 --> 01:42:54.060 align:start position:0%
the statute dealing with impact fees is
 
01:42:56.830 --> 01:42:56.840 align:start position:0%
the same is the same statute
 
01:43:01.669 --> 01:43:01.679 align:start position:0%
674-21.5 but uh sub paragraph e
 
01:43:03.530 --> 01:43:03.540 align:start position:0%
is the one that deals with impact fees
 
01:43:06.229 --> 01:43:06.239 align:start position:0%
and and the change six to ten also needs
 
01:43:07.729 --> 01:43:07.739 align:start position:0%
to be made there
 
01:43:11.209 --> 01:43:11.219 align:start position:0%
okay so that can be made when we go to
 
01:43:11.219 --> 01:43:12.350 align:start position:0%
okay so that can be made when we go to
drafting

01:43:12.350 --> 01:43:12.360 align:start position:0%
drafting
 
01:43:14.090 --> 01:43:14.100 align:start position:0%
representative Keller
 
01:43:16.729 --> 01:43:16.739 align:start position:0%
thank you for that explanation what um
 
01:43:18.470 --> 01:43:18.480 align:start position:0%
if you know
 
01:43:21.709 --> 01:43:21.719 align:start position:0%
what if you know was the Supreme Court's
 
01:43:26.330 --> 01:43:26.340 align:start position:0%
interpretation of your language and
 
01:43:31.250 --> 01:43:31.260 align:start position:0%
um and it it makes sense that if they
 
01:43:33.350 --> 01:43:33.360 align:start position:0%
interpreted it in
 
01:43:33.360 --> 01:43:34.729 align:start position:0%
interpreted it in
um

01:43:34.729 --> 01:43:34.739 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:43:38.629 --> 01:43:38.639 align:start position:0%
let's say creative ways that we come
 
01:43:40.629 --> 01:43:40.639 align:start position:0%
back and uh
 
01:43:43.609 --> 01:43:43.619 align:start position:0%
clarify that that language thank you
 
01:43:45.890 --> 01:43:45.900 align:start position:0%
thank you for that question I
 
01:43:47.090 --> 01:43:47.100 align:start position:0%
um I I'm
 
01:43:50.390 --> 01:43:50.400 align:start position:0%
trying to recall my recollection is that
 
01:43:52.490 --> 01:43:52.500 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court interpreted it to mean
 
01:43:56.030 --> 01:43:56.040 align:start position:0%
in the context of pelham's regulations
 
01:43:59.030 --> 01:43:59.040 align:start position:0%
uh they interpreted it to mean the
 
01:43:59.040 --> 01:44:00.649 align:start position:0%
uh they interpreted it to mean the
developer

01:44:00.649 --> 01:44:00.659 align:start position:0%
developer
 
01:44:03.950 --> 01:44:03.960 align:start position:0%
even though the developer might not
 
01:44:05.930 --> 01:44:05.940 align:start position:0%
necessarily have been the current owner
 
01:44:07.729 --> 01:44:07.739 align:start position:0%
of the property and that was the the
 
01:44:10.729 --> 01:44:10.739 align:start position:0%
essence of this dispute uh so I I recall
 
01:44:13.129 --> 01:44:13.139 align:start position:0%
being surprised by the decision and then
 
01:44:15.410 --> 01:44:15.420 align:start position:0%
reading it thinking well well okay yeah
 
01:44:19.310 --> 01:44:19.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:22.850 --> 01:44:22.860 align:start position:0%
represent walls thank you Mr chair Mr
 
01:44:24.649 --> 01:44:24.659 align:start position:0%
question I have
 
01:44:24.659 --> 01:44:25.910 align:start position:0%
question I have
um

01:44:25.910 --> 01:44:25.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:44:27.649 --> 01:44:27.659 align:start position:0%
I'm fine with the successor of Interest
 
01:44:29.750 --> 01:44:29.760 align:start position:0%
I understand all that thank you Mr Frost
 
01:44:32.390 --> 01:44:32.400 align:start position:0%
but on the six to ten years
 
01:44:32.400 --> 01:44:33.590 align:start position:0%
but on the six to ten years
um

01:44:33.590 --> 01:44:33.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:44:36.229 --> 01:44:36.239 align:start position:0%
from the date of collection usually if
 
01:44:39.169 --> 01:44:39.179 align:start position:0%
not always the impact fees are collected
 
01:44:41.209 --> 01:44:41.219 align:start position:0%
as part of a condition to get the
 
01:44:43.669 --> 01:44:43.679 align:start position:0%
approved to get the plans approved and
 
01:44:46.310 --> 01:44:46.320 align:start position:0%
signed off by by the planning board
 
01:44:50.570 --> 01:44:50.580 align:start position:0%
I and if our goal is to try to
 
01:44:53.270 --> 01:44:53.280 align:start position:0%
encourage development I don't know how
 
01:44:55.370 --> 01:44:55.380 align:start position:0%
allowing the municipalities to hold on
 
01:44:57.470 --> 01:44:57.480 align:start position:0%
to the developers capital for an
 
01:45:00.590 --> 01:45:00.600 align:start position:0%
additional four years is helping that
 
01:45:03.890 --> 01:45:03.900 align:start position:0%
goal now maybe you want to say something
 
01:45:06.290 --> 01:45:06.300 align:start position:0%
like six years after completion because
 
01:45:08.330 --> 01:45:08.340 align:start position:0%
I get it some some things do take longer
 
01:45:11.450 --> 01:45:11.460 align:start position:0%
than the six years but it's just to to
 
01:45:13.310 --> 01:45:13.320 align:start position:0%
for the municipality to hold on to
 
01:45:14.930 --> 01:45:14.940 align:start position:0%
developers working capital for an
 
01:45:16.609 --> 01:45:16.619 align:start position:0%
additional four years doesn't seem to be
 
01:45:18.410 --> 01:45:18.420 align:start position:0%
meeting the goals of what we're trying
 
01:45:21.709 --> 01:45:21.719 align:start position:0%
to do just a thought yep six years after
 
01:45:25.010 --> 01:45:25.020 align:start position:0%
completion I mean if a project takes
 
01:45:27.109 --> 01:45:27.119 align:start position:0%
six years and then they can hold another
 
01:45:31.550 --> 01:45:31.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:34.189 --> 01:45:34.199 align:start position:0%
yeah no I I know I'm I'm
 
01:45:36.410 --> 01:45:36.420 align:start position:0%
spitballing too so do you have anything
 
01:45:39.530 --> 01:45:39.540 align:start position:0%
for us on that thank you Mr chairman and
 
01:45:42.530 --> 01:45:42.540 align:start position:0%
I'll just note that I'm kind of arguing
 
01:45:45.169 --> 01:45:45.179 align:start position:0%
against interest here
 
01:45:48.649 --> 01:45:48.659 align:start position:0%
um typically I'm I'm speaking for uh the
 
01:45:51.109 --> 01:45:51.119 align:start position:0%
development side of the table but I'm
 
01:45:54.530 --> 01:45:54.540 align:start position:0%
also a land use planner I've worked uh
 
01:45:57.109 --> 01:45:57.119 align:start position:0%
four municipalities as a planner as a
 
01:45:58.790 --> 01:45:58.800 align:start position:0%
Town Administrator as a director of a
 
01:46:00.410 --> 01:46:00.420 align:start position:0%
regional Planning Commission so I really
 
01:46:03.109 --> 01:46:03.119 align:start position:0%
get the municipal side of things and
 
01:46:05.330 --> 01:46:05.340 align:start position:0%
there are projects and this is what we
 
01:46:07.129 --> 01:46:07.139 align:start position:0%
heard from the city of Manchester when
 
01:46:09.470 --> 01:46:09.480 align:start position:0%
the planning director addressed you
 
01:46:12.410 --> 01:46:12.420 align:start position:0%
several months ago there are projects
 
01:46:13.970 --> 01:46:13.980 align:start position:0%
that the municipalities are doing for
 
01:46:15.530 --> 01:46:15.540 align:start position:0%
which they're collecting impact fees
 
01:46:17.689 --> 01:46:17.699 align:start position:0%
that take longer than six years
 
01:46:19.729 --> 01:46:19.739 align:start position:0%
it takes longer for them to get them
 
01:46:22.370 --> 01:46:22.380 align:start position:0%
done in in order for them to be able to
 
01:46:25.310 --> 01:46:25.320 align:start position:0%
spend the impact fees and my sense is
 
01:46:27.649 --> 01:46:27.659 align:start position:0%
that the developers are already putting
 
01:46:31.189 --> 01:46:31.199 align:start position:0%
up this money anyway and it's not really
 
01:46:33.890 --> 01:46:33.900 align:start position:0%
terribly material whether it's held by
 
01:46:35.990 --> 01:46:36.000 align:start position:0%
the municipality for six or ten years
 
01:46:37.850 --> 01:46:37.860 align:start position:0%
it's part of their their cost of
 
01:46:37.860 --> 01:46:39.470 align:start position:0%
it's part of their their cost of
development

01:46:39.470 --> 01:46:39.480 align:start position:0%
development
 
01:46:41.209 --> 01:46:41.219 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
01:46:43.010 --> 01:46:43.020 align:start position:0%
let me ask you this
 
01:46:44.810 --> 01:46:44.820 align:start position:0%
how many impact fees are actually
 
01:46:44.820 --> 01:46:48.590 align:start position:0%
how many impact fees are actually
returned

01:46:48.590 --> 01:46:48.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:50.750 --> 01:46:50.760 align:start position:0%
that's an excellent question because if
 
01:46:52.310 --> 01:46:52.320 align:start position:0%
they're never returned anyway I guess
 
01:46:53.450 --> 01:46:53.460 align:start position:0%
the amount of years doesn't really
 
01:46:56.090 --> 01:46:56.100 align:start position:0%
matter we've got um some research from
 
01:46:57.470 --> 01:46:57.480 align:start position:0%
our committee researcher regarding that
 
01:46:59.870 --> 01:46:59.880 align:start position:0%
I think I can
 
01:47:01.790 --> 01:47:01.800 align:start position:0%
try to forward that to the committee I
 
01:47:04.070 --> 01:47:04.080 align:start position:0%
don't think she looked into how often
 
01:47:06.050 --> 01:47:06.060 align:start position:0%
they are returned but if there is a
 
01:47:07.490 --> 01:47:07.500 align:start position:0%
developer in the room or somebody that
 
01:47:09.229 --> 01:47:09.239 align:start position:0%
can help clarify that that'd be helpful
 
01:47:09.239 --> 01:47:10.310 align:start position:0%
can help clarify that that'd be helpful
but

01:47:10.310 --> 01:47:10.320 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:47:14.570 --> 01:47:14.580 align:start position:0%
I I know for one in Pelham that that was
 
01:47:16.550 --> 01:47:16.560 align:start position:0%
the subject of the uh the Supreme Court
 
01:47:16.560 --> 01:47:17.570 align:start position:0%
the subject of the uh the Supreme Court
decision

01:47:17.570 --> 01:47:17.580 align:start position:0%
decision
 
01:47:21.649 --> 01:47:21.659 align:start position:0%
and I know also that this is not really
 
01:47:24.350 --> 01:47:24.360 align:start position:0%
on point to your question but uh the
 
01:47:28.310 --> 01:47:28.320 align:start position:0%
town of Londonderry was sued by at least
 
01:47:32.030 --> 01:47:32.040 align:start position:0%
one developer may have been a couple uh
 
01:47:34.550 --> 01:47:34.560 align:start position:0%
in the the town was required to return
 
01:47:37.250 --> 01:47:37.260 align:start position:0%
something like 1.1 million dollars of
 
01:47:39.350 --> 01:47:39.360 align:start position:0%
impact fees because they had not been
 
01:47:45.830 --> 01:47:45.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:47.930 --> 01:47:47.940 align:start position:0%
something to think about representative
 
01:47:47.940 --> 01:47:49.129 align:start position:0%
something to think about representative
Keller

01:47:49.129 --> 01:47:49.139 align:start position:0%
Keller
 
01:47:50.570 --> 01:47:50.580 align:start position:0%
I think
 
01:47:51.770 --> 01:47:51.780 align:start position:0%
um thank you
 
01:47:54.649 --> 01:47:54.659 align:start position:0%
um I think I have to agree with
 
01:47:57.169 --> 01:47:57.179 align:start position:0%
representative Walsh that I'm not sure
 
01:47:57.179 --> 01:47:58.609 align:start position:0%
representative Walsh that I'm not sure
that

01:47:58.609 --> 01:47:58.619 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:47:58.619 --> 01:47:59.750 align:start position:0%
that
um in

01:47:59.750 --> 01:47:59.760 align:start position:0%
um in
 
01:48:02.270 --> 01:48:02.280 align:start position:0%
uh tying up the money for additional
 
01:48:04.550 --> 01:48:04.560 align:start position:0%
time frame
 
01:48:08.450 --> 01:48:08.460 align:start position:0%
um I think it is a little bit material
 
01:48:11.090 --> 01:48:11.100 align:start position:0%
um in the sense that if you have that
 
01:48:13.669 --> 01:48:13.679 align:start position:0%
money tied up for six years
 
01:48:15.129 --> 01:48:15.139 align:start position:0%
um once you get it returned
 
01:48:17.810 --> 01:48:17.820 align:start position:0%
theoretically you could put that money
 
01:48:20.209 --> 01:48:20.219 align:start position:0%
towards the next project so if you're
 
01:48:22.970 --> 01:48:22.980 align:start position:0%
doing multiple projects you're saying
 
01:48:25.250 --> 01:48:25.260 align:start position:0%
you can build let's say
 
01:48:28.070 --> 01:48:28.080 align:start position:0%
the difference between five projects
 
01:48:32.149 --> 01:48:32.159 align:start position:0%
over 30 years versus three projects over
 
01:48:35.810 --> 01:48:35.820 align:start position:0%
30 years using the same Capital
 
01:48:35.820 --> 01:48:38.030 align:start position:0%
30 years using the same Capital
um the

01:48:38.030 --> 01:48:38.040 align:start position:0%
um the
 
01:48:38.040 --> 01:48:39.229 align:start position:0%
um the
the

01:48:39.229 --> 01:48:39.239 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:48:41.689 --> 01:48:41.699 align:start position:0%
um so there is that
 
01:48:45.169 --> 01:48:45.179 align:start position:0%
um there also could be just the
 
01:48:47.390 --> 01:48:47.400 align:start position:0%
um a change instead of to the time frame
 
01:48:49.729 --> 01:48:49.739 align:start position:0%
just something along like
 
01:48:49.739 --> 01:48:50.470 align:start position:0%
just something along like
um

01:48:50.470 --> 01:48:50.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:48:52.430 --> 01:48:52.440 align:start position:0%
municipality that doesn't want to return
 
01:48:56.149 --> 01:48:56.159 align:start position:0%
the money to the to the taxpayers May
 
01:48:56.159 --> 01:48:57.530 align:start position:0%
the money to the to the taxpayers May
encumber

01:48:57.530 --> 01:48:57.540 align:start position:0%
encumber
 
01:49:00.470 --> 01:49:00.480 align:start position:0%
funds that essentially sign a contract
 
01:49:03.229 --> 01:49:03.239 align:start position:0%
I'm going to do XYZ project
 
01:49:05.750 --> 01:49:05.760 align:start position:0%
I haven't completed it yet I haven't got
 
01:49:07.790 --> 01:49:07.800 align:start position:0%
the final bill for it yet but I'm doing
 
01:49:10.010 --> 01:49:10.020 align:start position:0%
that project and it is tied to this
 
01:49:12.649 --> 01:49:12.659 align:start position:0%
money and therefore you could do we
 
01:49:14.570 --> 01:49:14.580 align:start position:0%
could theoretically do something instead
 
01:49:17.209 --> 01:49:17.219 align:start position:0%
of just extending the time frame it just
 
01:49:19.790 --> 01:49:19.800 align:start position:0%
um maybe clarifying or I'm not seeing
 
01:49:22.010 --> 01:49:22.020 align:start position:0%
anything that says like you can like
 
01:49:25.149 --> 01:49:25.159 align:start position:0%
quote unquote encumber this money for
 
01:49:29.050 --> 01:49:29.060 align:start position:0%
XYZ project that is currently like
 
01:49:31.790 --> 01:49:31.800 align:start position:0%
proposed planned developed whatever the
 
01:49:33.950 --> 01:49:33.960 align:start position:0%
case may be and so
 
01:49:35.209 --> 01:49:35.219 align:start position:0%
um that money
 
01:49:38.030 --> 01:49:38.040 align:start position:0%
is like designated to this project even
 
01:49:39.530 --> 01:49:39.540 align:start position:0%
though the project isn't necessarily
 
01:49:42.169 --> 01:49:42.179 align:start position:0%
completed within that six year window
 
01:49:45.470 --> 01:49:45.480 align:start position:0%
if you get my drift so
 
01:49:49.070 --> 01:49:49.080 align:start position:0%
representative I I do and I think that
 
01:49:51.050 --> 01:49:51.060 align:start position:0%
that is at least in part already
 
01:49:54.290 --> 01:49:54.300 align:start position:0%
addressed in statured so it it a
 
01:49:57.169 --> 01:49:57.179 align:start position:0%
municipality May appropriate the funds
 
01:49:58.629 --> 01:49:58.639 align:start position:0%
to do something
 
01:50:02.390 --> 01:50:02.400 align:start position:0%
and that essentially secures that impact
 
01:50:07.910 --> 01:50:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:11.870 --> 01:50:11.880 align:start position:0%
well thank you Miss Frost again
 
01:50:14.570 --> 01:50:14.580 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to go back to the drawing
 
01:50:15.890 --> 01:50:15.900 align:start position:0%
board with this and come back to the
 
01:50:17.570 --> 01:50:17.580 align:start position:0%
committee if that works just to see if
 
01:50:19.310 --> 01:50:19.320 align:start position:0%
we have something else that we can come
 
01:50:20.510 --> 01:50:20.520 align:start position:0%
up with
 
01:50:21.530 --> 01:50:21.540 align:start position:0%
um so I have a question for the
 
01:50:24.050 --> 01:50:24.060 align:start position:0%
committee we have two more two more
 
01:50:25.729 --> 01:50:25.739 align:start position:0%
things I would like to that's on my
 
01:50:25.739 --> 01:50:26.810 align:start position:0%
things I would like to that's on my
agenda

01:50:26.810 --> 01:50:26.820 align:start position:0%
agenda
 
01:50:29.390 --> 01:50:29.400 align:start position:0%
um one is some dot standards a
 
01:50:31.550 --> 01:50:31.560 align:start position:0%
conversation representative Walsh had
 
01:50:34.010 --> 01:50:34.020 align:start position:0%
with um the director and then
 
01:50:36.590 --> 01:50:36.600 align:start position:0%
um representative reads
 
01:50:38.570 --> 01:50:38.580 align:start position:0%
um proposed legislation for adus do we
 
01:50:39.709 --> 01:50:39.719 align:start position:0%
want to power through lunch or do we
 
01:50:43.669 --> 01:50:43.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:43.679 --> 01:50:47.209 align:start position:0%
 
representative

01:50:47.209 --> 01:50:47.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:49.430 --> 01:50:49.440 align:start position:0%
okay let's take let's take a 15-minute
 
01:50:52.430 --> 01:50:52.440 align:start position:0%
break come back at 1205 and uh we will
 
01:50:54.590 --> 01:50:54.600 align:start position:0%
power through lunch
 
01:51:03.470 --> 01:51:03.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:03.480 --> 02:10:33.649 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

02:10:33.649 --> 02:10:33.659 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:35.450 --> 02:10:35.460 align:start position:0%
committee on housing
 
02:10:37.490 --> 02:10:37.500 align:start position:0%
um on my agenda doesn't mean there
 
02:10:39.229 --> 02:10:39.239 align:start position:0%
aren't any other things on the agenda
 
02:10:41.750 --> 02:10:41.760 align:start position:0%
but online I have two more things I'm
 
02:10:43.910 --> 02:10:43.920 align:start position:0%
going to start with the I perceive to be
 
02:10:46.310 --> 02:10:46.320 align:start position:0%
the faster one and I'm gonna call on
 
02:10:47.810 --> 02:10:47.820 align:start position:0%
representative Walsh to kind of give us
 
02:10:50.810 --> 02:10:50.820 align:start position:0%
an update on a meeting you had with the
 
02:10:52.370 --> 02:10:52.380 align:start position:0%
Department of Transportation and
 
02:10:55.629 --> 02:10:55.639 align:start position:0%
hopefully uh maybe some recommended
 
02:10:57.950 --> 02:10:57.960 align:start position:0%
changes or
 
02:10:57.960 --> 02:10:59.089 align:start position:0%
changes or
um

02:10:59.089 --> 02:10:59.099 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:11:01.070 --> 02:11:01.080 align:start position:0%
an update thank you
 
02:11:03.649 --> 02:11:03.659 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and um I'm not going
 
02:11:04.970 --> 02:11:04.980 align:start position:0%
to apologize because it's still August
 
02:11:07.129 --> 02:11:07.139 align:start position:0%
I'm not as far along as some either I
 
02:11:09.709 --> 02:11:09.719 align:start position:0%
don't have recommended legislation or
 
02:11:13.790 --> 02:11:13.800 align:start position:0%
even a report I just met with the uh
 
02:11:15.109 --> 02:11:15.119 align:start position:0%
Department of Transportation this
 
02:11:17.270 --> 02:11:17.280 align:start position:0%
morning would you like me to just go on
 
02:11:20.570 --> 02:11:20.580 align:start position:0%
the Fly based on my notes okay
 
02:11:23.089 --> 02:11:23.099 align:start position:0%
well if memory serves the reason that
 
02:11:26.209 --> 02:11:26.219 align:start position:0%
the Department of Transportation or Road
 
02:11:28.910 --> 02:11:28.920 align:start position:0%
way requirements came up was one of the
 
02:11:30.050 --> 02:11:30.060 align:start position:0%
one of the
 
02:11:32.870 --> 02:11:32.880 align:start position:0%
the presenters we had who was who
 
02:11:34.250 --> 02:11:34.260 align:start position:0%
suggested I believe he was the one
 
02:11:37.430 --> 02:11:37.440 align:start position:0%
talking about tiny homes and maybe the
 
02:11:39.770 --> 02:11:39.780 align:start position:0%
roadways are you know prohibitive the
 
02:11:41.870 --> 02:11:41.880 align:start position:0%
cost of roadways is prohibitive and
 
02:11:43.970 --> 02:11:43.980 align:start position:0%
actually he was looking at dirt roads
 
02:11:43.980 --> 02:11:44.629 align:start position:0%
actually he was looking at dirt roads
um

02:11:44.629 --> 02:11:44.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:11:46.669 --> 02:11:46.679 align:start position:0%
so what I did with that is I spoke with
 
02:11:49.189 --> 02:11:49.199 align:start position:0%
a couple of consultants and developers
 
02:11:52.189 --> 02:11:52.199 align:start position:0%
and my my code enforcement officer
 
02:11:55.010 --> 02:11:55.020 align:start position:0%
what I found without too much work was
 
02:11:57.950 --> 02:11:57.960 align:start position:0%
that yes perhaps a lot of towns do use
 
02:12:00.470 --> 02:12:00.480 align:start position:0%
the requirements for Department of
 
02:12:02.770 --> 02:12:02.780 align:start position:0%
Transportation roadways as the accepted
 
02:12:06.169 --> 02:12:06.179 align:start position:0%
accepted structure
 
02:12:08.089 --> 02:12:08.099 align:start position:0%
um nobody knew of any that were actually
 
02:12:10.609 --> 02:12:10.619 align:start position:0%
abusing it or using roadway requirements
 
02:12:13.370 --> 02:12:13.380 align:start position:0%
as a way to deter development
 
02:12:15.890 --> 02:12:15.900 align:start position:0%
the other side of the coin is too that
 
02:12:17.089 --> 02:12:17.099 align:start position:0%
um I don't know what we can do
 
02:12:19.490 --> 02:12:19.500 align:start position:0%
legislatively because any changes from
 
02:12:21.229 --> 02:12:21.239 align:start position:0%
what's an accepted standard for a
 
02:12:21.239 --> 02:12:22.430 align:start position:0%
what's an accepted standard for a
roadway

02:12:22.430 --> 02:12:22.440 align:start position:0%
roadway
 
02:12:22.440 --> 02:12:23.950 align:start position:0%
roadway
once

02:12:23.950 --> 02:12:23.960 align:start position:0%
once
 
02:12:26.270 --> 02:12:26.280 align:start position:0%
I don't know who anybody would want to
 
02:12:28.250 --> 02:12:28.260 align:start position:0%
go backwards you know after development
 
02:12:31.129 --> 02:12:31.139 align:start position:0%
is completed the town actually where the
 
02:12:33.589 --> 02:12:33.599 align:start position:0%
municipality takes ownership of the road
 
02:12:36.350 --> 02:12:36.360 align:start position:0%
and I don't know of any that would want
 
02:12:39.530 --> 02:12:39.540 align:start position:0%
to require substandard roadways because
 
02:12:41.870 --> 02:12:41.880 align:start position:0%
who would want to rebuild them in five
 
02:12:44.510 --> 02:12:44.520 align:start position:0%
years after a Project's complete so I
 
02:12:46.189 --> 02:12:46.199 align:start position:0%
did not look up that tree much I didn't
 
02:12:47.990 --> 02:12:48.000 align:start position:0%
find a problem as soon as I talked to
 
02:12:50.109 --> 02:12:50.119 align:start position:0%
consultants and developers
 
02:12:52.550 --> 02:12:52.560 align:start position:0%
if they had known of anybody that was
 
02:12:56.089 --> 02:12:56.099 align:start position:0%
using this to try to deter nobody did
 
02:12:59.390 --> 02:12:59.400 align:start position:0%
it's just an accepted cost however in my
 
02:13:00.950 --> 02:13:00.960 align:start position:0%
experience I can tell you part of the
 
02:13:03.350 --> 02:13:03.360 align:start position:0%
cost or what is contributing to a lot of
 
02:13:05.330 --> 02:13:05.340 align:start position:0%
the cost of Roads
 
02:13:08.149 --> 02:13:08.159 align:start position:0%
uh we've been debating this in Hooksett
 
02:13:09.890 --> 02:13:09.900 align:start position:0%
for 12 years since I've been involved
 
02:13:13.669 --> 02:13:13.679 align:start position:0%
probably longer right now we are not
 
02:13:16.790 --> 02:13:16.800 align:start position:0%
requiring sidewalks and curbs and
 
02:13:20.830 --> 02:13:20.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:23.569 --> 02:13:23.579 align:start position:0%
that doesn't mean arterial roads that
 
02:13:25.550 --> 02:13:25.560 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean Common Sense places and and
 
02:13:27.770 --> 02:13:27.780 align:start position:0%
this is why I mean I couldn't get
 
02:13:30.109 --> 02:13:30.119 align:start position:0%
anybody to say does sidewalks and curbs
 
02:13:31.910 --> 02:13:31.920 align:start position:0%
double or triple the cost of a road
 
02:13:33.830 --> 02:13:33.840 align:start position:0%
because every situation is different but
 
02:13:36.649 --> 02:13:36.659 align:start position:0%
clearly it's a huge expense without
 
02:13:40.729 --> 02:13:40.739 align:start position:0%
curbs and sidewalks you the rain water
 
02:13:42.589 --> 02:13:42.599 align:start position:0%
storm water can actually sheet off
 
02:13:45.350 --> 02:13:45.360 align:start position:0%
occasionally you might need a Swale but
 
02:13:46.370 --> 02:13:46.380 align:start position:0%
it's all on the side of the road
 
02:13:49.189 --> 02:13:49.199 align:start position:0%
relatively inexpensive the minute you
 
02:13:52.550 --> 02:13:52.560 align:start position:0%
introduce curbs now you're introducing
 
02:13:55.129 --> 02:13:55.139 align:start position:0%
all the infrastructure that goes below
 
02:13:57.709 --> 02:13:57.719 align:start position:0%
it all your drainage structures or your
 
02:14:03.470 --> 02:14:03.480 align:start position:0%
traps boxes piping etc etc so it you
 
02:14:04.609 --> 02:14:04.619 align:start position:0%
don't even have to look at anecdotally
 
02:14:06.950 --> 02:14:06.960 align:start position:0%
you can see it common sense obviously
 
02:14:08.330 --> 02:14:08.340 align:start position:0%
it's a huge cost
 
02:14:11.629 --> 02:14:11.639 align:start position:0%
they also don't last forever and once
 
02:14:13.189 --> 02:14:13.199 align:start position:0%
you have sidewalks now with state law
 
02:14:15.109 --> 02:14:15.119 align:start position:0%
that the town has to maintain them as
 
02:14:18.470 --> 02:14:18.480 align:start position:0%
well including plowing so if you're
 
02:14:21.589 --> 02:14:21.599 align:start position:0%
possibly looking at something to reduce
 
02:14:24.410 --> 02:14:24.420 align:start position:0%
the prices of roadways maybe that's the
 
02:14:27.109 --> 02:14:27.119 align:start position:0%
direction you would want to look by not
 
02:14:30.169 --> 02:14:30.179 align:start position:0%
allowing them to mandate them where not
 
02:14:33.589 --> 02:14:33.599 align:start position:0%
necessary I'll throw that out there what
 
02:14:35.569 --> 02:14:35.579 align:start position:0%
we did in hooks it is we just made
 
02:14:38.270 --> 02:14:38.280 align:start position:0%
adjustments in the road width and a
 
02:14:40.910 --> 02:14:40.920 align:start position:0%
painted line and again this is not
 
02:14:43.250 --> 02:14:43.260 align:start position:0%
something that I'd recommend on arterial
 
02:14:45.470 --> 02:14:45.480 align:start position:0%
roads or any of your major you know
 
02:14:47.689 --> 02:14:47.699 align:start position:0%
roadways but you're cul-de-sacs you're
 
02:14:49.910 --> 02:14:49.920 align:start position:0%
small subdivisions that go nowhere
 
02:14:52.850 --> 02:14:52.860 align:start position:0%
you're adding a heck of a lot of cost to
 
02:14:54.890 --> 02:14:54.900 align:start position:0%
the town and the people that buy in that
 
02:14:57.050 --> 02:14:57.060 align:start position:0%
because they have to pay for it by
 
02:14:59.330 --> 02:14:59.340 align:start position:0%
introducing sidewalks that go nowhere in
 
02:15:02.629 --> 02:15:02.639 align:start position:0%
most cases there's no connectivity
 
02:15:04.430 --> 02:15:04.440 align:start position:0%
so I'll leave that alone because that's
 
02:15:06.470 --> 02:15:06.480 align:start position:0%
why we even got dot involved in this in
 
02:15:08.569 --> 02:15:08.579 align:start position:0%
the first place but I figured I'd go and
 
02:15:10.129 --> 02:15:10.139 align:start position:0%
we'll look at a recommendation if you
 
02:15:11.810 --> 02:15:11.820 align:start position:0%
even want to go down that that road
 
02:15:13.790 --> 02:15:13.800 align:start position:0%
excuse the pun
 
02:15:16.010 --> 02:15:16.020 align:start position:0%
uh but I did have a meeting with the
 
02:15:17.330 --> 02:15:17.340 align:start position:0%
Department of Transportation this
 
02:15:20.089 --> 02:15:20.099 align:start position:0%
morning with a goal of seeing how we
 
02:15:22.189 --> 02:15:22.199 align:start position:0%
could possibly streamline reduce delays
 
02:15:24.530 --> 02:15:24.540 align:start position:0%
which also reduce costs
 
02:15:27.290 --> 02:15:27.300 align:start position:0%
and uh believe it or not they all the
 
02:15:29.109 --> 02:15:29.119 align:start position:0%
questions I had for him
 
02:15:32.030 --> 02:15:32.040 align:start position:0%
they've already started implementing so
 
02:15:33.589 --> 02:15:33.599 align:start position:0%
and quickly I'll go through this
 
02:15:35.450 --> 02:15:35.460 align:start position:0%
obviously the first thing we know and
 
02:15:36.830 --> 02:15:36.840 align:start position:0%
again I've talked with some of the same
 
02:15:38.930 --> 02:15:38.940 align:start position:0%
consultants and Developers
 
02:15:41.450 --> 02:15:41.460 align:start position:0%
they admit there are delays those delays
 
02:15:43.550 --> 02:15:43.560 align:start position:0%
can be expensive but they also
 
02:15:45.410 --> 02:15:45.420 align:start position:0%
understand that like everybody else
 
02:15:49.189 --> 02:15:49.199 align:start position:0%
according to dot they're looking at 20
 
02:15:50.830 --> 02:15:50.840 align:start position:0%
to 30 percent
 
02:15:54.410 --> 02:15:54.420 align:start position:0%
short-handed you know with Workforce we
 
02:15:56.750 --> 02:15:56.760 align:start position:0%
all get that they're not using that as
 
02:15:58.129 --> 02:15:58.139 align:start position:0%
an excuse but they're actually starting
 
02:16:01.790 --> 02:16:01.800 align:start position:0%
to do some things that may help they are
 
02:16:04.250 --> 02:16:04.260 align:start position:0%
currently introducing an electronic
 
02:16:06.470 --> 02:16:06.480 align:start position:0%
permitting system because right now they
 
02:16:08.629 --> 02:16:08.639 align:start position:0%
do not have any an applicant doesn't
 
02:16:10.729 --> 02:16:10.739 align:start position:0%
have any way to track where his
 
02:16:13.609 --> 02:16:13.619 align:start position:0%
application is uh within within the
 
02:16:16.010 --> 02:16:16.020 align:start position:0%
department so they've already begun
 
02:16:19.129 --> 02:16:19.139 align:start position:0%
uh implementing that
 
02:16:20.990 --> 02:16:21.000 align:start position:0%
um they're also looking on another one
 
02:16:23.030 --> 02:16:23.040 align:start position:0%
which did raise my eyes I think this one
 
02:16:25.069 --> 02:16:25.079 align:start position:0%
is is hugely important in terms of
 
02:16:27.950 --> 02:16:27.960 align:start position:0%
saving money in the long run
 
02:16:32.870 --> 02:16:32.880 align:start position:0%
prior to them implementing a conceptual
 
02:16:32.880 --> 02:16:34.070 align:start position:0%
prior to them implementing a conceptual
approval

02:16:34.070 --> 02:16:34.080 align:start position:0%
approval
 
02:16:37.310 --> 02:16:37.320 align:start position:0%
they needed 100 complete drawings before
 
02:16:39.290 --> 02:16:39.300 align:start position:0%
they would take an application so that
 
02:16:40.610 --> 02:16:40.620 align:start position:0%
means that the developer and the
 
02:16:42.129 --> 02:16:42.139 align:start position:0%
engineer would have to come up with 100
 
02:16:44.870 --> 02:16:44.880 align:start position:0%
submit them and if something didn't work
 
02:16:46.849 --> 02:16:46.859 align:start position:0%
with the dot or for whatever reason then
 
02:16:48.110 --> 02:16:48.120 align:start position:0%
they'd have to go back to the drawing
 
02:16:49.490 --> 02:16:49.500 align:start position:0%
board and start over
 
02:16:53.150 --> 02:16:53.160 align:start position:0%
by them getting into this 30 complete or
 
02:16:53.160 --> 02:16:55.190 align:start position:0%
by them getting into this 30 complete or
conceptual

02:16:55.190 --> 02:16:55.200 align:start position:0%
conceptual
 
02:16:56.929 --> 02:16:56.939 align:start position:0%
they can have the conversation with the
 
02:16:59.150 --> 02:16:59.160 align:start position:0%
D.O.T possibly get a conceptual approval
 
02:17:01.250 --> 02:17:01.260 align:start position:0%
before they spend all the time and money
 
02:17:04.370 --> 02:17:04.380 align:start position:0%
to finish the complete plan set
 
02:17:06.349 --> 02:17:06.359 align:start position:0%
I think that's a huge step in the right
 
02:17:08.089 --> 02:17:08.099 align:start position:0%
direction again they're already starting
 
02:17:10.849 --> 02:17:10.859 align:start position:0%
to implement this
 
02:17:10.859 --> 02:17:13.190 align:start position:0%
to implement this
um

02:17:13.190 --> 02:17:13.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:15.530 --> 02:17:15.540 align:start position:0%
I mentioned too because we have I don't
 
02:17:16.730 --> 02:17:16.740 align:start position:0%
know if you've ever seen it and I don't
 
02:17:18.290 --> 02:17:18.300 align:start position:0%
have it presented but you can find it on
 
02:17:20.209 --> 02:17:20.219 align:start position:0%
the dot website
 
02:17:22.549 --> 02:17:22.559 align:start position:0%
the way that works is we have districts
 
02:17:25.370 --> 02:17:25.380 align:start position:0%
throughout the state the two Southern
 
02:17:27.709 --> 02:17:27.719 align:start position:0%
districts five and six obviously by
 
02:17:31.009 --> 02:17:31.019 align:start position:0%
volume are the busiest and I did ask the
 
02:17:32.509 --> 02:17:32.519 align:start position:0%
question and get the answer to the
 
02:17:32.519 --> 02:17:33.650 align:start position:0%
question and get the answer to the
affirmative

02:17:33.650 --> 02:17:33.660 align:start position:0%
affirmative
 
02:17:37.009 --> 02:17:37.019 align:start position:0%
that joined the high volume seasons for
 
02:17:39.530 --> 02:17:39.540 align:start position:0%
districts five and six they can and do
 
02:17:42.169 --> 02:17:42.179 align:start position:0%
use some of the engineers and field
 
02:17:44.089 --> 02:17:44.099 align:start position:0%
workers from the other slower districts
 
02:17:45.950 --> 02:17:45.960 align:start position:0%
where lower volume districts to help
 
02:17:48.650 --> 02:17:48.660 align:start position:0%
them catch up with a workload
 
02:17:50.690 --> 02:17:50.700 align:start position:0%
in the process of that they're also
 
02:17:52.429 --> 02:17:52.439 align:start position:0%
exploring the idea of doing a
 
02:17:54.950 --> 02:17:54.960 align:start position:0%
centralized permitting process and
 
02:17:56.570 --> 02:17:56.580 align:start position:0%
eliminating the need of doing it within
 
02:17:58.730 --> 02:17:58.740 align:start position:0%
districts there's pros and cons to that
 
02:17:59.870 --> 02:17:59.880 align:start position:0%
but it's something they're looking into
 
02:17:59.880 --> 02:18:01.490 align:start position:0%
but it's something they're looking into
now

02:18:01.490 --> 02:18:01.500 align:start position:0%
now
 
02:18:03.830 --> 02:18:03.840 align:start position:0%
um but again I think with the the 30
 
02:18:05.690 --> 02:18:05.700 align:start position:0%
conceptual that they've already started
 
02:18:08.270 --> 02:18:08.280 align:start position:0%
to implement and the electronic
 
02:18:10.250 --> 02:18:10.260 align:start position:0%
permitting system so that they can
 
02:18:12.049 --> 02:18:12.059 align:start position:0%
actually have a tracking number if the
 
02:18:13.610 --> 02:18:13.620 align:start position:0%
developer with the applicant to find out
 
02:18:16.849 --> 02:18:16.859 align:start position:0%
what stages that are in can be a huge
 
02:18:16.859 --> 02:18:17.870 align:start position:0%
what stages that are in can be a huge
help

02:18:17.870 --> 02:18:17.880 align:start position:0%
help
 
02:18:21.589 --> 02:18:21.599 align:start position:0%
uh again I I did not come out of there
 
02:18:24.410 --> 02:18:24.420 align:start position:0%
with any eyebrow raising things that yes
 
02:18:26.690 --> 02:18:26.700 align:start position:0%
we should legislate this uh but I did
 
02:18:28.969 --> 02:18:28.979 align:start position:0%
ask the question uh one of the things
 
02:18:31.610 --> 02:18:31.620 align:start position:0%
that the DOT
 
02:18:35.270 --> 02:18:35.280 align:start position:0%
uh does now and it's voluntary with the
 
02:18:38.389 --> 02:18:38.399 align:start position:0%
applicants as if if they're overwhelmed
 
02:18:40.790 --> 02:18:40.800 align:start position:0%
uh they do give an applicant the
 
02:18:43.190 --> 02:18:43.200 align:start position:0%
opportunity to hire their own peer
 
02:18:45.770 --> 02:18:45.780 align:start position:0%
review engineer
 
02:18:47.950 --> 02:18:47.960 align:start position:0%
for the approval process
 
02:18:50.929 --> 02:18:50.939 align:start position:0%
and therefore cuts down their time they
 
02:18:52.549 --> 02:18:52.559 align:start position:0%
can just review what somebody else did
 
02:18:54.709 --> 02:18:54.719 align:start position:0%
because I didn't realize this they don't
 
02:18:56.690 --> 02:18:56.700 align:start position:0%
have a permitting fee at the D.O.T right
 
02:18:56.700 --> 02:18:57.650 align:start position:0%
have a permitting fee at the D.O.T right
now

02:18:57.650 --> 02:18:57.660 align:start position:0%
now
 
02:19:00.589 --> 02:19:00.599 align:start position:0%
so one of his suggestions if this
 
02:19:02.929 --> 02:19:02.939 align:start position:0%
continues to be a problem would be the
 
02:19:06.049 --> 02:19:06.059 align:start position:0%
entertain of an idea of allowing
 
02:19:07.849 --> 02:19:07.859 align:start position:0%
the Department of Transportation to
 
02:19:10.929 --> 02:19:10.939 align:start position:0%
collect fees for their permits
 
02:19:14.030 --> 02:19:14.040 align:start position:0%
those are the only two things that as a
 
02:19:16.190 --> 02:19:16.200 align:start position:0%
possibility to consider
 
02:19:18.169 --> 02:19:18.179 align:start position:0%
and on my own if you're really looking
 
02:19:20.450 --> 02:19:20.460 align:start position:0%
at reducing the cost of roadways and and
 
02:19:22.910 --> 02:19:22.920 align:start position:0%
residential subdivisions eliminating
 
02:19:26.030 --> 02:19:26.040 align:start position:0%
curbs and sidewalks were not needed
 
02:19:28.009 --> 02:19:28.019 align:start position:0%
I'll leave it there
 
02:19:29.810 --> 02:19:29.820 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you
 
02:19:32.870 --> 02:19:32.880 align:start position:0%
representative Walsh representative Reed
 
02:19:35.089 --> 02:19:35.099 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for that research
 
02:19:38.330 --> 02:19:38.340 align:start position:0%
representative and I I tend to agree
 
02:19:40.190 --> 02:19:40.200 align:start position:0%
with you that I think it makes more
 
02:19:42.290 --> 02:19:42.300 align:start position:0%
sense in a lot of places to just expand
 
02:19:43.849 --> 02:19:43.859 align:start position:0%
the width of a road I mean I'm going
 
02:19:45.950 --> 02:19:45.960 align:start position:0%
back to the original Point expand the
 
02:19:47.929 --> 02:19:47.939 align:start position:0%
width of a road and just have a
 
02:19:50.150 --> 02:19:50.160 align:start position:0%
essentially a lane and I just wanted to
 
02:19:53.750 --> 02:19:53.760 align:start position:0%
ask if you had asked about or was it
 
02:19:55.670 --> 02:19:55.680 align:start position:0%
brought up because I've seen both in
 
02:19:58.130 --> 02:19:58.140 align:start position:0%
Boston as well as Portsmouth and I don't
 
02:20:00.889 --> 02:20:00.899 align:start position:0%
know the word for them but the tall
 
02:20:04.070 --> 02:20:04.080 align:start position:0%
narrow like bumpers that in addition to
 
02:20:06.349 --> 02:20:06.359 align:start position:0%
having a painted line basically offer
 
02:20:08.030 --> 02:20:08.040 align:start position:0%
the level of protection that a curb
 
02:20:10.270 --> 02:20:10.280 align:start position:0%
would offer so there's these Long Tall
 
02:20:13.070 --> 02:20:13.080 align:start position:0%
sticks plastic sticks and they fold down
 
02:20:14.950 --> 02:20:14.960 align:start position:0%
what are they called
 
02:20:18.170 --> 02:20:18.180 align:start position:0%
delineators sure they fold down if a car
 
02:20:20.690 --> 02:20:20.700 align:start position:0%
runs over them but it's a visual barrier
 
02:20:22.910 --> 02:20:22.920 align:start position:0%
to prevent a car from swerving into that
 
02:20:26.450 --> 02:20:26.460 align:start position:0%
uh bicycle slash walking Lane which
 
02:20:28.310 --> 02:20:28.320 align:start position:0%
could also have extra benefit of
 
02:20:30.710 --> 02:20:30.720 align:start position:0%
providing like an emergency pullover if
 
02:20:33.170 --> 02:20:33.180 align:start position:0%
necessary in a pinch or you know for
 
02:20:35.150 --> 02:20:35.160 align:start position:0%
emergency vehicles so I think that makes
 
02:20:38.270 --> 02:20:38.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:40.730 --> 02:20:40.740 align:start position:0%
I don't know the name of them I did not
 
02:20:42.710 --> 02:20:42.720 align:start position:0%
ask the question because I basically
 
02:20:44.389 --> 02:20:44.399 align:start position:0%
envisioned just this in your quiet
 
02:20:46.389 --> 02:20:46.399 align:start position:0%
residential areas
 
02:20:48.590 --> 02:20:48.600 align:start position:0%
but if I did have to come up with a name
 
02:20:51.349 --> 02:20:51.359 align:start position:0%
on my own I would say plow drivers
 
02:20:57.710 --> 02:20:57.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:00.349 --> 02:21:00.359 align:start position:0%
represent McConkey
 
02:21:03.050 --> 02:21:03.060 align:start position:0%
um thank you there was a bill that came
 
02:21:05.389 --> 02:21:05.399 align:start position:0%
through Public Works last year I believe
 
02:21:10.130 --> 02:21:10.140 align:start position:0%
or uh dot had made the suggestion that
 
02:21:11.870 --> 02:21:11.880 align:start position:0%
they would like to move
 
02:21:15.110 --> 02:21:15.120 align:start position:0%
to having a fee based permits so they
 
02:21:17.210 --> 02:21:17.220 align:start position:0%
could do that so I can't remember what
 
02:21:19.969 --> 02:21:19.979 align:start position:0%
the outcome was if we put it into uh to
 
02:21:22.250 --> 02:21:22.260 align:start position:0%
study or not I've always been a huge
 
02:21:27.410 --> 02:21:27.420 align:start position:0%
believer of painted painted lines on on
 
02:21:29.349 --> 02:21:29.359 align:start position:0%
a road I like a little wider Road
 
02:21:34.150 --> 02:21:34.160 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of calming happens
 
02:21:36.849 --> 02:21:36.859 align:start position:0%
walkable communities
 
02:21:40.190 --> 02:21:40.200 align:start position:0%
become better when you take the travel
 
02:21:43.790 --> 02:21:43.800 align:start position:0%
way which is traditionally a 12 feet and
 
02:21:45.710 --> 02:21:45.720 align:start position:0%
take it to 10 feet especially through
 
02:21:48.950 --> 02:21:48.960 align:start position:0%
communities and secondary roads and it
 
02:21:51.530 --> 02:21:51.540 align:start position:0%
gives the allusion to the driver that
 
02:21:53.090 --> 02:21:53.100 align:start position:0%
they have to pay a little more attention
 
02:21:55.790 --> 02:21:55.800 align:start position:0%
so then if you had a two foot shoulder
 
02:21:59.030 --> 02:21:59.040 align:start position:0%
it now gives you a four foot shoulder a
 
02:22:01.309 --> 02:22:01.319 align:start position:0%
lot of Road agents aren't as
 
02:22:04.010 --> 02:22:04.020 align:start position:0%
enthusiastic as me but I always keep
 
02:22:06.469 --> 02:22:06.479 align:start position:0%
putting it out there and it has it has a
 
02:22:09.530 --> 02:22:09.540 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:11.389 --> 02:22:11.399 align:start position:0%
representative Damon
 
02:22:13.610 --> 02:22:13.620 align:start position:0%
I just want to weigh in also with
 
02:22:16.309 --> 02:22:16.319 align:start position:0%
support for the painted line as a
 
02:22:16.319 --> 02:22:18.410 align:start position:0%
support for the painted line as a
cyclist

02:22:18.410 --> 02:22:18.420 align:start position:0%
cyclist
 
02:22:21.910 --> 02:22:21.920 align:start position:0%
um when you're biking where it's marked
 
02:22:25.010 --> 02:22:25.020 align:start position:0%
drivers are notably more attentive and
 
02:22:27.230 --> 02:22:27.240 align:start position:0%
courteous versus the same width Road
 
02:22:30.469 --> 02:22:30.479 align:start position:0%
without a line
 
02:22:32.510 --> 02:22:32.520 align:start position:0%
um there's a lot of territorial disputes
 
02:22:38.389 --> 02:22:38.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:41.270 --> 02:22:41.280 align:start position:0%
I representative Walsh what have you um
 
02:22:43.309 --> 02:22:43.319 align:start position:0%
I brought this up earlier but um how
 
02:22:45.290 --> 02:22:45.300 align:start position:0%
would you feel about something about
 
02:22:47.570 --> 02:22:47.580 align:start position:0%
like conditional permitting because I
 
02:22:51.590 --> 02:22:51.600 align:start position:0%
guess so one of the costs for people
 
02:22:54.889 --> 02:22:54.899 align:start position:0%
trying even you know me if I want to
 
02:22:56.690 --> 02:22:56.700 align:start position:0%
build a driveway on my property or even
 
02:22:59.389 --> 02:22:59.399 align:start position:0%
a developer is the time it takes for
 
02:23:02.150 --> 02:23:02.160 align:start position:0%
these driveways to be these permits to
 
02:23:03.170 --> 02:23:03.180 align:start position:0%
be issued
 
02:23:04.969 --> 02:23:04.979 align:start position:0%
how would you feel about legislation
 
02:23:06.290 --> 02:23:06.300 align:start position:0%
that would
 
02:23:06.300 --> 02:23:08.030 align:start position:0%
that would
approve

02:23:08.030 --> 02:23:08.040 align:start position:0%
approve
 
02:23:09.950 --> 02:23:09.960 align:start position:0%
a permit
 
02:23:12.469 --> 02:23:12.479 align:start position:0%
unless there was notification from dot
 
02:23:14.570 --> 02:23:14.580 align:start position:0%
that they needed more time to evaluate
 
02:23:14.580 --> 02:23:15.290 align:start position:0%
that they needed more time to evaluate
it

02:23:15.290 --> 02:23:15.300 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:23:16.910 --> 02:23:16.920 align:start position:0%
so I understand they're they're in a
 
02:23:18.170 --> 02:23:18.180 align:start position:0%
staffing shortage maybe that's part of
 
02:23:19.730 --> 02:23:19.740 align:start position:0%
the reason why they aren't approving
 
02:23:21.469 --> 02:23:21.479 align:start position:0%
them as fast but one of the biggest
 
02:23:24.590 --> 02:23:24.600 align:start position:0%
issues developers had was the time it
 
02:23:25.790 --> 02:23:25.800 align:start position:0%
takes for some of these permits to be
 
02:23:27.410 --> 02:23:27.420 align:start position:0%
approved I know Des does something
 
02:23:29.929 --> 02:23:29.939 align:start position:0%
similar to what I'm proposing so what do
 
02:23:32.690 --> 02:23:32.700 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:32.700 --> 02:23:33.290 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:23:33.290 --> 02:23:33.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:23:35.090 --> 02:23:35.100 align:start position:0%
at first approach I'm not opposed to
 
02:23:36.410 --> 02:23:36.420 align:start position:0%
that at all and and for this reason
 
02:23:40.190 --> 02:23:40.200 align:start position:0%
we've we've actually by law imposed time
 
02:23:42.590 --> 02:23:42.600 align:start position:0%
limits on zoning and planning boards I
 
02:23:44.990 --> 02:23:45.000 align:start position:0%
believe last year Des is currently doing
 
02:23:45.000 --> 02:23:46.130 align:start position:0%
believe last year Des is currently doing
it

02:23:46.130 --> 02:23:46.140 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:23:48.770 --> 02:23:48.780 align:start position:0%
they do they have a time limit from
 
02:23:51.730 --> 02:23:51.740 align:start position:0%
start from application drop off
 
02:23:55.849 --> 02:23:55.859 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:57.950 --> 02:23:57.960 align:start position:0%
um I'm not opposed to it I'd like to do
 
02:24:00.230 --> 02:24:00.240 align:start position:0%
a little more research on it to see what
 
02:24:02.929 --> 02:24:02.939 align:start position:0%
number of days that would be effectively
 
02:24:02.939 --> 02:24:05.690 align:start position:0%
number of days that would be effectively
again

02:24:05.690 --> 02:24:05.700 align:start position:0%
again
 
02:24:07.910 --> 02:24:07.920 align:start position:0%
one of the admissions I got today from
 
02:24:10.070 --> 02:24:10.080 align:start position:0%
the Department was
 
02:24:12.050 --> 02:24:12.060 align:start position:0%
all the problems that and they
 
02:24:13.969 --> 02:24:13.979 align:start position:0%
understand what's going on but they're
 
02:24:16.250 --> 02:24:16.260 align:start position:0%
not using the Manpower issue as a crutch
 
02:24:17.870 --> 02:24:17.880 align:start position:0%
by any stretch
 
02:24:19.490 --> 02:24:19.500 align:start position:0%
but right now all the solutions are
 
02:24:21.590 --> 02:24:21.600 align:start position:0%
anecdotal they don't have any data of
 
02:24:23.090 --> 02:24:23.100 align:start position:0%
their own and they're hoping that this
 
02:24:24.830 --> 02:24:24.840 align:start position:0%
electronic permanent system will start
 
02:24:27.050 --> 02:24:27.060 align:start position:0%
showing them where the problems really
 
02:24:29.090 --> 02:24:29.100 align:start position:0%
are so
 
02:24:30.650 --> 02:24:30.660 align:start position:0%
as much as I'm not opposed to what
 
02:24:33.050 --> 02:24:33.060 align:start position:0%
you're saying I don't know if it's ready
 
02:24:34.670 --> 02:24:34.680 align:start position:0%
you know what I mean I don't know what
 
02:24:36.590 --> 02:24:36.600 align:start position:0%
basis we're putting that timeline on
 
02:24:38.570 --> 02:24:38.580 align:start position:0%
without having any information that they
 
02:24:40.849 --> 02:24:40.859 align:start position:0%
do currently so
 
02:24:42.110 --> 02:24:42.120 align:start position:0%
um representative McConkey do you have
 
02:24:44.570 --> 02:24:44.580 align:start position:0%
any information on Des the that
 
02:24:44.580 --> 02:24:45.889 align:start position:0%
any information on Des the that
permitting

02:24:45.889 --> 02:24:45.899 align:start position:0%
permitting
 
02:24:48.469 --> 02:24:48.479 align:start position:0%
system the condition permitting through
 
02:24:51.050 --> 02:24:51.060 align:start position:0%
Des or if you had something else to add
 
02:24:52.550 --> 02:24:52.560 align:start position:0%
um I have something else but on Des
 
02:24:55.969 --> 02:24:55.979 align:start position:0%
there are there are time limits on how
 
02:24:58.730 --> 02:24:58.740 align:start position:0%
long they they must have they must turn
 
02:25:00.770 --> 02:25:00.780 align:start position:0%
out a report by
 
02:25:03.590 --> 02:25:03.600 align:start position:0%
um and uh it every time it creates
 
02:25:06.290 --> 02:25:06.300 align:start position:0%
better and better efficiency and you
 
02:25:08.870 --> 02:25:08.880 align:start position:0%
know to the benefit of the uh of our
 
02:25:11.690 --> 02:25:11.700 align:start position:0%
residents there there is
 
02:25:14.150 --> 02:25:14.160 align:start position:0%
um I'm not opposed to putting a time
 
02:25:16.490 --> 02:25:16.500 align:start position:0%
limit on a driveway permit they may want
 
02:25:19.309 --> 02:25:19.319 align:start position:0%
to be a two-tier process a simple
 
02:25:22.429 --> 02:25:22.439 align:start position:0%
residential as opposed to a
 
02:25:25.610 --> 02:25:25.620 align:start position:0%
a commercial operation I could see that
 
02:25:30.170 --> 02:25:30.180 align:start position:0%
but from my my permitting that I've done
 
02:25:33.889 --> 02:25:33.899 align:start position:0%
in several counties it's well known that
 
02:25:35.809 --> 02:25:35.819 align:start position:0%
there are certain districts that will
 
02:25:39.410 --> 02:25:39.420 align:start position:0%
turn out a report a permit much quicker
 
02:25:42.469 --> 02:25:42.479 align:start position:0%
than the others and there are districts
 
02:25:44.830 --> 02:25:44.840 align:start position:0%
that cause an awful lot of
 
02:25:48.830 --> 02:25:48.840 align:start position:0%
more reporting to be done and mapping
 
02:25:51.910 --> 02:25:51.920 align:start position:0%
and so forth so the point that
 
02:25:54.830 --> 02:25:54.840 align:start position:0%
representative had mentioned next to me
 
02:25:56.929 --> 02:25:56.939 align:start position:0%
that they will begin the process that's
 
02:25:59.330 --> 02:25:59.340 align:start position:0%
positive but I don't think it hurts us
 
02:26:02.750 --> 02:26:02.760 align:start position:0%
at all by imposing a number on that and
 
02:26:05.510 --> 02:26:05.520 align:start position:0%
I think it's a good idea and and I think
 
02:26:07.190 --> 02:26:07.200 align:start position:0%
you're right with the two-tiered system
 
02:26:09.050 --> 02:26:09.060 align:start position:0%
I mean if we're looking at you know
 
02:26:10.730 --> 02:26:10.740 align:start position:0%
single-family residential that just
 
02:26:12.830 --> 02:26:12.840 align:start position:0%
wants you know a driveway in a different
 
02:26:15.770 --> 02:26:15.780 align:start position:0%
spot I see no reason why the state is in
 
02:26:17.750 --> 02:26:17.760 align:start position:0%
the way and hindering that you know and
 
02:26:19.610 --> 02:26:19.620 align:start position:0%
if they need more time you can put in
 
02:26:20.870 --> 02:26:20.880 align:start position:0%
the language say all you have to do is
 
02:26:22.849 --> 02:26:22.859 align:start position:0%
send a letter that you need more time in
 
02:26:24.830 --> 02:26:24.840 align:start position:0%
that that would be allowed so
 
02:26:26.210 --> 02:26:26.220 align:start position:0%
how's the committee feel about something
 
02:26:28.190 --> 02:26:28.200 align:start position:0%
like that
 
02:26:30.410 --> 02:26:30.420 align:start position:0%
good do you want to do you want to start
 
02:26:31.730 --> 02:26:31.740 align:start position:0%
drafting something like that or would
 
02:26:34.690 --> 02:26:34.700 align:start position:0%
you like me to look into it
 
02:26:38.750 --> 02:26:38.760 align:start position:0%
that sounds good okay representative
 
02:26:42.889 --> 02:26:42.899 align:start position:0%
I'm just wondering about the
 
02:26:42.899 --> 02:26:43.990 align:start position:0%
I'm just wondering about the
the

02:26:43.990 --> 02:26:44.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:26:44.000 --> 02:26:45.950 align:start position:0%
the
[Music]

02:26:45.950 --> 02:26:45.960 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:26:50.750 --> 02:26:50.760 align:start position:0%
actual effect of saying okay you can
 
02:26:52.969 --> 02:26:52.979 align:start position:0%
have as much time as you want or you can
 
02:26:55.849 --> 02:26:55.859 align:start position:0%
have an extension maybe one extension or
 
02:26:57.650 --> 02:26:57.660 align:start position:0%
something like that if you write this
 
02:26:57.660 --> 02:26:59.030 align:start position:0%
something like that if you write this
letter

02:26:59.030 --> 02:26:59.040 align:start position:0%
letter
 
02:27:00.770 --> 02:27:00.780 align:start position:0%
um you know they could just have the
 
02:27:04.190 --> 02:27:04.200 align:start position:0%
copy machine going you know at full bore
 
02:27:07.370 --> 02:27:07.380 align:start position:0%
like printing out these letters and and
 
02:27:09.050 --> 02:27:09.060 align:start position:0%
sending them out
 
02:27:12.650 --> 02:27:12.660 align:start position:0%
how does that actually
 
02:27:15.650 --> 02:27:15.660 align:start position:0%
help that end user get their get their
 
02:27:17.870 --> 02:27:17.880 align:start position:0%
driveway permit
 
02:27:20.330 --> 02:27:20.340 align:start position:0%
faster I don't I don't see how sending
 
02:27:22.010 --> 02:27:22.020 align:start position:0%
requiring the department to send a
 
02:27:23.630 --> 02:27:23.640 align:start position:0%
letter helps
 
02:27:23.640 --> 02:27:25.250 align:start position:0%
letter helps
anyone

02:27:25.250 --> 02:27:25.260 align:start position:0%
anyone
 
02:27:27.110 --> 02:27:27.120 align:start position:0%
well I I like to think the Department's
 
02:27:29.450 --> 02:27:29.460 align:start position:0%
not going to just print letters and send
 
02:27:31.309 --> 02:27:31.319 align:start position:0%
them out to every single person that
 
02:27:34.130 --> 02:27:34.140 align:start position:0%
asks for a permit I think that the
 
02:27:36.650 --> 02:27:36.660 align:start position:0%
intent is so that somebody within a
 
02:27:39.110 --> 02:27:39.120 align:start position:0%
single family you know area or
 
02:27:42.410 --> 02:27:42.420 align:start position:0%
residential area should have
 
02:27:44.330 --> 02:27:44.340 align:start position:0%
there should be reasonable timelines
 
02:27:46.550 --> 02:27:46.560 align:start position:0%
placed on these State agencies to issue
 
02:27:48.410 --> 02:27:48.420 align:start position:0%
permits so I think you're I think you're
 
02:27:49.969 --> 02:27:49.979 align:start position:0%
what ifing it I don't think that the
 
02:27:51.590 --> 02:27:51.600 align:start position:0%
that dot would do something like that
 
02:27:51.600 --> 02:27:58.190 align:start position:0%
that dot would do something like that
but

02:27:58.190 --> 02:27:58.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:01.010 --> 02:28:01.020 align:start position:0%
representative Walsh no I agree and
 
02:28:02.870 --> 02:28:02.880 align:start position:0%
never underestimate the value of a paper
 
02:28:05.450 --> 02:28:05.460 align:start position:0%
trail if you've got repeated letters
 
02:28:08.389 --> 02:28:08.399 align:start position:0%
from A Department that's the do nothing
 
02:28:11.030 --> 02:28:11.040 align:start position:0%
um it goes a long ways for your file so
 
02:28:12.889 --> 02:28:12.899 align:start position:0%
they I even allowing them to have the
 
02:28:17.170 --> 02:28:17.180 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:19.670 --> 02:28:19.680 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I'll take you back
 
02:28:19.680 --> 02:28:20.929 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I'll take you back
to

02:28:20.929 --> 02:28:20.939 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:28:22.910 --> 02:28:22.920 align:start position:0%
um 80 with department environmental
 
02:28:25.250 --> 02:28:25.260 align:start position:0%
services subsurface they had a
 
02:28:27.650 --> 02:28:27.660 align:start position:0%
regulations they had 30 days to review
 
02:28:32.090 --> 02:28:32.100 align:start position:0%
an application they did on many many an
 
02:28:34.730 --> 02:28:34.740 align:start position:0%
occasion wait till day 29 to send out
 
02:28:36.170 --> 02:28:36.180 align:start position:0%
the letter and here's why I'm not going
 
02:28:39.710 --> 02:28:39.720 align:start position:0%
to do it once we're able to catalog how
 
02:28:42.170 --> 02:28:42.180 align:start position:0%
many times that was happening we then
 
02:28:44.570 --> 02:28:44.580 align:start position:0%
came back in and their their present
 
02:28:47.630 --> 02:28:47.640 align:start position:0%
processes now that they will they will
 
02:28:49.670 --> 02:28:49.680 align:start position:0%
process almost every application within
 
02:28:52.790 --> 02:28:52.800 align:start position:0%
two days so the paper trail that was
 
02:28:58.389 --> 02:28:58.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:01.610 --> 02:29:01.620 align:start position:0%
I like it
 
02:29:03.830 --> 02:29:03.840 align:start position:0%
two days two day permitting issue that
 
02:29:05.630 --> 02:29:05.640 align:start position:0%
sounds good yeah
 
02:29:05.640 --> 02:29:06.770 align:start position:0%
sounds good yeah
perfect

02:29:06.770 --> 02:29:06.780 align:start position:0%
perfect
 
02:29:08.990 --> 02:29:09.000 align:start position:0%
all right anything else on Department of
 
02:29:09.000 --> 02:29:10.730 align:start position:0%
all right anything else on Department of
Transportation

02:29:10.730 --> 02:29:10.740 align:start position:0%
Transportation
 
02:29:13.309 --> 02:29:13.319 align:start position:0%
okay representative Reed
 
02:29:16.730 --> 02:29:16.740 align:start position:0%
last but not least can you please
 
02:29:19.250 --> 02:29:19.260 align:start position:0%
present on your two bills I I sure can
 
02:29:19.260 --> 02:29:20.389 align:start position:0%
present on your two bills I I sure can
now

02:29:20.389 --> 02:29:20.399 align:start position:0%
now
 
02:29:20.399 --> 02:29:21.110 align:start position:0%
now
um

02:29:21.110 --> 02:29:21.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:29:23.870 --> 02:29:23.880 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to just rather than step
 
02:29:25.730 --> 02:29:25.740 align:start position:0%
through every step of both bills they're
 
02:29:28.250 --> 02:29:28.260 align:start position:0%
they are largely identical the only
 
02:29:30.650 --> 02:29:30.660 align:start position:0%
thing that is different is the expansion
 
02:29:34.070 --> 02:29:34.080 align:start position:0%
of uh one unit by right to two so I'm
 
02:29:36.790 --> 02:29:36.800 align:start position:0%
just going to work off of the 2260
 
02:29:40.370 --> 02:29:40.380 align:start position:0%
Amendment which is the all-inclusive one
 
02:29:42.230 --> 02:29:42.240 align:start position:0%
and then when we get to places of
 
02:29:43.750 --> 02:29:43.760 align:start position:0%
difference I will
 
02:29:46.969 --> 02:29:46.979 align:start position:0%
tell you that it's different
 
02:29:49.969 --> 02:29:49.979 align:start position:0%
um so the first three Roman numerals
 
02:29:52.550 --> 02:29:52.560 align:start position:0%
here are definitions we have cleaned up
 
02:29:54.530 --> 02:29:54.540 align:start position:0%
the definitions
 
02:29:56.330 --> 02:29:56.340 align:start position:0%
um so accessory dwelling unit is what we
 
02:29:57.830 --> 02:29:57.840 align:start position:0%
think of as an accessory dwelling unit
 
02:29:59.570 --> 02:29:59.580 align:start position:0%
it's located on a lot containing a
 
02:30:01.490 --> 02:30:01.500 align:start position:0%
single family dwelling and it provides
 
02:30:03.469 --> 02:30:03.479 align:start position:0%
independent living and then we go into
 
02:30:06.370 --> 02:30:06.380 align:start position:0%
the definitions of attached and detached
 
02:30:08.929 --> 02:30:08.939 align:start position:0%
representative yokella has already made
 
02:30:11.330 --> 02:30:11.340 align:start position:0%
me aware of some grammatical changes
 
02:30:14.570 --> 02:30:14.580 align:start position:0%
that should be made primarily the
 
02:30:17.090 --> 02:30:17.100 align:start position:0%
definition should say attached unit or
 
02:30:18.650 --> 02:30:18.660 align:start position:0%
attached accessory dwelling unit and
 
02:30:21.950 --> 02:30:21.960 align:start position:0%
detached unit and also in in number
 
02:30:23.690 --> 02:30:23.700 align:start position:0%
three detached there's con some
 
02:30:26.030 --> 02:30:26.040 align:start position:0%
redundancy that needs to be simplified
 
02:30:28.750 --> 02:30:28.760 align:start position:0%
but there's nothing substantive there
 
02:30:31.969 --> 02:30:31.979 align:start position:0%
moving on so this is one of those places
 
02:30:33.950 --> 02:30:33.960 align:start position:0%
where the two bills are different two
 
02:30:35.389 --> 02:30:35.399 align:start position:0%
accessory dwelling units shall be
 
02:30:36.830 --> 02:30:36.840 align:start position:0%
allowed without additional requirement
 
02:30:38.630 --> 02:30:38.640 align:start position:0%
for lot size except as described in the
 
02:30:40.429 --> 02:30:40.439 align:start position:0%
section setbacks aesthetic requirements
 
02:30:42.770 --> 02:30:42.780 align:start position:0%
design review requirements so that is
 
02:30:45.110 --> 02:30:45.120 align:start position:0%
obviously not in
 
02:30:48.969 --> 02:30:48.979 align:start position:0%
the um the the one that excludes that
 
02:30:53.630 --> 02:30:53.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:56.929 --> 02:30:56.939 align:start position:0%
I will say that this part that is in the
 
02:31:01.030 --> 02:31:01.040 align:start position:0%
same area is is on this bill the 2260
 
02:31:03.530 --> 02:31:03.540 align:start position:0%
but it's further down so I will just
 
02:31:05.570 --> 02:31:05.580 align:start position:0%
wait till I get there
 
02:31:07.370 --> 02:31:07.380 align:start position:0%
um and then it basically is saying the
 
02:31:08.929 --> 02:31:08.939 align:start position:0%
same thing as that first paragraph on
 
02:31:11.870 --> 02:31:11.880 align:start position:0%
line 17 is saying I mean municipality
 
02:31:14.690 --> 02:31:14.700 align:start position:0%
that adopts a zoning ordinance will
 
02:31:16.969 --> 02:31:16.979 align:start position:0%
allow to buy right and then the
 
02:31:20.030 --> 02:31:20.040 align:start position:0%
paragraph two on line 30 is that if no
 
02:31:23.030 --> 02:31:23.040 align:start position:0%
zoning ordinance contains Provisions
 
02:31:24.469 --> 02:31:24.479 align:start position:0%
um then two units will be allowed by
 
02:31:27.710 --> 02:31:27.720 align:start position:0%
right so that's also not in the other
 
02:31:27.720 --> 02:31:29.510 align:start position:0%
right so that's also not in the other
version

02:31:29.510 --> 02:31:29.520 align:start position:0%
version
 
02:31:32.030 --> 02:31:32.040 align:start position:0%
we had discussed as a committee and
 
02:31:34.309 --> 02:31:34.319 align:start position:0%
decided I believe collectively to just
 
02:31:37.250 --> 02:31:37.260 align:start position:0%
strike the requirement for a door
 
02:31:39.710 --> 02:31:39.720 align:start position:0%
between the accessory dwelling unit and
 
02:31:42.950 --> 02:31:42.960 align:start position:0%
the primary structure uh and I had
 
02:31:45.110 --> 02:31:45.120 align:start position:0%
spoken with others and just nobody had a
 
02:31:47.510 --> 02:31:47.520 align:start position:0%
reason whether it was Town planners or
 
02:31:49.849 --> 02:31:49.859 align:start position:0%
anybody else why that was required to
 
02:31:51.710 --> 02:31:51.720 align:start position:0%
begin with and since we have detached
 
02:31:53.809 --> 02:31:53.819 align:start position:0%
units or units that are considered
 
02:31:55.969 --> 02:31:55.979 align:start position:0%
attached but in pre-existing detached
 
02:31:58.370 --> 02:31:58.380 align:start position:0%
structures it just didn't make sense to
 
02:32:01.429 --> 02:32:01.439 align:start position:0%
to have it so it's completely struck
 
02:32:03.410 --> 02:32:03.420 align:start position:0%
um the following paragraph So This is
 
02:32:05.929 --> 02:32:05.939 align:start position:0%
where this is on page one of the other
 
02:32:08.690 --> 02:32:08.700 align:start position:0%
version but the point is is that and
 
02:32:11.030 --> 02:32:11.040 align:start position:0%
this was from mercatus this was a
 
02:32:14.990 --> 02:32:15.000 align:start position:0%
um an ask for mercatus so uh
 
02:32:18.490 --> 02:32:18.500 align:start position:0%
the existing language is that uh
 
02:32:20.570 --> 02:32:20.580 align:start position:0%
Municipal regulation apple is single
 
02:32:22.730 --> 02:32:22.740 align:start position:0%
family drilling shall apply to the
 
02:32:24.170 --> 02:32:24.180 align:start position:0%
combination of the principal drawing
 
02:32:26.990 --> 02:32:27.000 align:start position:0%
unit and an Adu but not limited to lot
 
02:32:28.370 --> 02:32:28.380 align:start position:0%
coverage standards or standards for
 
02:32:30.830 --> 02:32:30.840 align:start position:0%
maximum occupancy per bedroom consistent
 
02:32:32.809 --> 02:32:32.819 align:start position:0%
with policy adopted by U.S Department of
 
02:32:35.210 --> 02:32:35.220 align:start position:0%
Housing or Urban Development then the
 
02:32:37.010 --> 02:32:37.020 align:start position:0%
addition is what was requested provided
 
02:32:38.929 --> 02:32:38.939 align:start position:0%
that such Municipal regulations shall
 
02:32:41.330 --> 02:32:41.340 align:start position:0%
not be more restrictive for adus than
 
02:32:43.610 --> 02:32:43.620 align:start position:0%
for the principal dwelling unit so a
 
02:32:46.070 --> 02:32:46.080 align:start position:0%
town can't kind of up that requirement
 
02:32:47.990 --> 02:32:48.000 align:start position:0%
if that requirement was not on the
 
02:32:48.000 --> 02:32:49.190 align:start position:0%
if that requirement was not on the
original

02:32:49.190 --> 02:32:49.200 align:start position:0%
original
 
02:32:51.590 --> 02:32:51.600 align:start position:0%
structure I mean as a spelling may
 
02:32:53.450 --> 02:32:53.460 align:start position:0%
require additional parking to accommend
 
02:32:55.790 --> 02:32:55.800 align:start position:0%
this is what we discussed in in
 
02:32:58.670 --> 02:32:58.680 align:start position:0%
committee uh additional parking to
 
02:33:00.650 --> 02:33:00.660 align:start position:0%
accommodate in Adu and here we are
 
02:33:03.469 --> 02:33:03.479 align:start position:0%
specifying but it shall not be more than
 
02:33:07.309 --> 02:33:07.319 align:start position:0%
one spot per bedroom and I did confirm
 
02:33:09.950 --> 02:33:09.960 align:start position:0%
that a studio apartment is considered
 
02:33:14.150 --> 02:33:14.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:17.389 --> 02:33:17.399 align:start position:0%
so the paragraph Roman numeral four is
 
02:33:19.550 --> 02:33:19.560 align:start position:0%
already in law that just says that a
 
02:33:22.370 --> 02:33:22.380 align:start position:0%
town can deny it on the basis of an
 
02:33:22.380 --> 02:33:23.770 align:start position:0%
town can deny it on the basis of an
inadequate

02:33:23.770 --> 02:33:23.780 align:start position:0%
inadequate
 
02:33:26.809 --> 02:33:26.819 align:start position:0%
septic plan
 
02:33:30.590 --> 02:33:30.600 align:start position:0%
um in water also paragraph five the
 
02:33:32.389 --> 02:33:32.399 align:start position:0%
municipality may require owner occupancy
 
02:33:35.050 --> 02:33:35.060 align:start position:0%
of one of the units also already in law
 
02:33:38.330 --> 02:33:38.340 align:start position:0%
but can't say which unit so an owner
 
02:33:40.490 --> 02:33:40.500 align:start position:0%
could for example move into their own
 
02:33:42.410 --> 02:33:42.420 align:start position:0%
Adu and then rent out the primary
 
02:33:42.420 --> 02:33:44.210 align:start position:0%
Adu and then rent out the primary
structure

02:33:44.210 --> 02:33:44.220 align:start position:0%
structure
 
02:33:46.910 --> 02:33:46.920 align:start position:0%
uh paragraph six a municipality May
 
02:33:48.710 --> 02:33:48.720 align:start position:0%
establish standards for adus for the
 
02:33:49.969 --> 02:33:49.979 align:start position:0%
purpose of maintaining aesthetic
 
02:33:51.530 --> 02:33:51.540 align:start position:0%
Community with principal dwelling in his
 
02:33:52.910 --> 02:33:52.920 align:start position:0%
single family dwelling this is already
 
02:33:55.130 --> 02:33:55.140 align:start position:0%
in law I would not have come up with
 
02:33:58.490 --> 02:33:58.500 align:start position:0%
that the part that we changed here is uh
 
02:34:00.830 --> 02:34:00.840 align:start position:0%
changing the fact that towns can
 
02:34:03.410 --> 02:34:03.420 align:start position:0%
restrict it down to 750 square feet
 
02:34:05.090 --> 02:34:05.100 align:start position:0%
meaning the maximum size for an Adu
 
02:34:07.490 --> 02:34:07.500 align:start position:0%
would top out at 750 if the town so
 
02:34:10.309 --> 02:34:10.319 align:start position:0%
chose changing that to a thousand square
 
02:34:12.530 --> 02:34:12.540 align:start position:0%
feet for one of the units Allowed by
 
02:34:15.309 --> 02:34:15.319 align:start position:0%
right in 850 for any other unit
 
02:34:18.530 --> 02:34:18.540 align:start position:0%
and then we had talked about some and
 
02:34:20.090 --> 02:34:20.100 align:start position:0%
this is going way back to one of the
 
02:34:22.790 --> 02:34:22.800 align:start position:0%
presentations but the idea of not having
 
02:34:25.969 --> 02:34:25.979 align:start position:0%
an Adu bigger than the primary dwelling
 
02:34:29.630 --> 02:34:29.640 align:start position:0%
unit and uh in order to address that we
 
02:34:31.610 --> 02:34:31.620 align:start position:0%
say if the primary structure is a
 
02:34:33.530 --> 02:34:33.540 align:start position:0%
thousand square feet or less the
 
02:34:36.050 --> 02:34:36.060 align:start position:0%
municipality May restrict any of the
 
02:34:37.790 --> 02:34:37.800 align:start position:0%
accessory dwelling units 800 square feet
 
02:34:41.210 --> 02:34:41.220 align:start position:0%
because this references the potential
 
02:34:43.610 --> 02:34:43.620 align:start position:0%
for more than one Adu that's allowed by
 
02:34:43.620 --> 02:34:45.110 align:start position:0%
for more than one Adu that's allowed by
right

02:34:45.110 --> 02:34:45.120 align:start position:0%
right
 
02:34:47.389 --> 02:34:47.399 align:start position:0%
um the language has changed in the other
 
02:34:50.389 --> 02:34:50.399 align:start position:0%
version to reflect that there's no
 
02:34:52.370 --> 02:34:52.380 align:start position:0%
second one that's allowed by right
 
02:34:54.830 --> 02:34:54.840 align:start position:0%
but the whole point of that change in
 
02:34:57.050 --> 02:34:57.060 align:start position:0%
square footage was to really bring these
 
02:34:59.809 --> 02:34:59.819 align:start position:0%
adus more into the normal market for
 
02:35:02.690 --> 02:35:02.700 align:start position:0%
housing because at 750 square feet we're
 
02:35:05.090 --> 02:35:05.100 align:start position:0%
really being exclusionary to like a lot
 
02:35:06.469 --> 02:35:06.479 align:start position:0%
of small families you're really only
 
02:35:09.710 --> 02:35:09.720 align:start position:0%
talking about one occupant usually
 
02:35:12.290 --> 02:35:12.300 align:start position:0%
uh paragraph seven a municipality may
 
02:35:13.610 --> 02:35:13.620 align:start position:0%
not require a familiar relationship
 
02:35:15.650 --> 02:35:15.660 align:start position:0%
between the occupants of the Adu which
 
02:35:17.929 --> 02:35:17.939 align:start position:0%
is already in law also in law is in law
 
02:35:20.630 --> 02:35:20.640 align:start position:0%
is paragraph eight may not the mean
 
02:35:22.490 --> 02:35:22.500 align:start position:0%
spelling may not limit an Adu to only
 
02:35:24.770 --> 02:35:24.780 align:start position:0%
one bedroom paragraph nine an accessory
 
02:35:26.690 --> 02:35:26.700 align:start position:0%
joining unit may be deemed a unit of
 
02:35:28.070 --> 02:35:28.080 align:start position:0%
Workforce housing for purposes of
 
02:35:30.530 --> 02:35:30.540 align:start position:0%
satisfying the municipality's obligation
 
02:35:34.429 --> 02:35:34.439 align:start position:0%
so we're saying that this helps towns
 
02:35:36.349 --> 02:35:36.359 align:start position:0%
reach their Workforce housing
 
02:35:39.830 --> 02:35:39.840 align:start position:0%
requirements also and this is specific
 
02:35:42.290 --> 02:35:42.300 align:start position:0%
to this version which includes the
 
02:35:44.809 --> 02:35:44.819 align:start position:0%
second Adu that a municipality may
 
02:35:46.849 --> 02:35:46.859 align:start position:0%
require that if a property has two or
 
02:35:48.469 --> 02:35:48.479 align:start position:0%
more accessory dwelling units one of
 
02:35:50.570 --> 02:35:50.580 align:start position:0%
them shall meet the criteria
 
02:35:53.030 --> 02:35:53.040 align:start position:0%
meaning that they still have the ability
 
02:35:55.990 --> 02:35:56.000 align:start position:0%
to restrict that second unit provided
 
02:35:58.910 --> 02:35:58.920 align:start position:0%
by saying that the person developing
 
02:36:00.830 --> 02:36:00.840 align:start position:0%
that unit has to rent that out at
 
02:36:04.429 --> 02:36:04.439 align:start position:0%
Workforce housing levels so we lose that
 
02:36:06.950 --> 02:36:06.960 align:start position:0%
kind of carrot in in really that benefit
 
02:36:09.830 --> 02:36:09.840 align:start position:0%
to the entire housing market if we don't
 
02:36:12.650 --> 02:36:12.660 align:start position:0%
have the second Adu
 
02:36:12.660 --> 02:36:13.490 align:start position:0%
have the second Adu
um

02:36:13.490 --> 02:36:13.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:36:15.469 --> 02:36:15.479 align:start position:0%
paragraph 10 a municipality shall allow
 
02:36:17.809 --> 02:36:17.819 align:start position:0%
adus to be converted from existing
 
02:36:19.550 --> 02:36:19.560 align:start position:0%
structures including but not into two
 
02:36:21.710 --> 02:36:21.720 align:start position:0%
garages regardless of whether such such
 
02:36:23.630 --> 02:36:23.640 align:start position:0%
structure violates current dimensional
 
02:36:25.550 --> 02:36:25.560 align:start position:0%
requirements for setbacks or lot
 
02:36:27.530 --> 02:36:27.540 align:start position:0%
coverage this was a clarification again
 
02:36:29.389 --> 02:36:29.399 align:start position:0%
from mercatus
 
02:36:32.150 --> 02:36:32.160 align:start position:0%
and then finally this is the whole
 
02:36:33.830 --> 02:36:33.840 align:start position:0%
reason we had to Define attach and
 
02:36:35.809 --> 02:36:35.819 align:start position:0%
detach so under detach accessory
 
02:36:38.090 --> 02:36:38.100 align:start position:0%
dwelling units this was the current uh
 
02:36:40.309 --> 02:36:40.319 align:start position:0%
language that we are changing a
 
02:36:42.410 --> 02:36:42.420 align:start position:0%
municipality is required to permit
 
02:36:44.690 --> 02:36:44.700 align:start position:0%
detach accessory dwelling units for at
 
02:36:46.610 --> 02:36:46.620 align:start position:0%
least one unit Allowed by right under
 
02:36:48.110 --> 02:36:48.120 align:start position:0%
this chapter but may require any other
 
02:36:52.610 --> 02:36:52.620 align:start position:0%
units to be attached so again with the
 
02:36:54.290 --> 02:36:54.300 align:start position:0%
changes made here
 
02:36:58.610 --> 02:36:58.620 align:start position:0%
a talent at most if a town exercises its
 
02:37:00.410 --> 02:37:00.420 align:start position:0%
right to limit according to what we've
 
02:37:03.710 --> 02:37:03.720 align:start position:0%
set forth here at most a person would be
 
02:37:06.469 --> 02:37:06.479 align:start position:0%
able to have one attached Adu which you
 
02:37:09.050 --> 02:37:09.060 align:start position:0%
would not visually recognize as an Adu
 
02:37:11.750 --> 02:37:11.760 align:start position:0%
most likely and then one detached at a
 
02:37:13.730 --> 02:37:13.740 align:start position:0%
maximum so you wouldn't see like
 
02:37:16.550 --> 02:37:16.560 align:start position:0%
multiple extra structures you might see
 
02:37:18.830 --> 02:37:18.840 align:start position:0%
a barn and then maybe one extra
 
02:37:18.840 --> 02:37:20.150 align:start position:0%
a barn and then maybe one extra
structure

02:37:20.150 --> 02:37:20.160 align:start position:0%
structure
 
02:37:22.910 --> 02:37:22.920 align:start position:0%
so a municipality and finally the other
 
02:37:25.130 --> 02:37:25.140 align:start position:0%
ability we've given municipalities to
 
02:37:28.370 --> 02:37:28.380 align:start position:0%
restrict adus is it may require a
 
02:37:30.230 --> 02:37:30.240 align:start position:0%
property to have a minimum lot size of
 
02:37:31.849 --> 02:37:31.859 align:start position:0%
up to one half acre in order to have
 
02:37:35.090 --> 02:37:35.100 align:start position:0%
more than one Adu so
 
02:37:37.670 --> 02:37:37.680 align:start position:0%
um that doesn't impact the current 180
 
02:37:39.290 --> 02:37:39.300 align:start position:0%
ueu have by right but if we were to
 
02:37:41.330 --> 02:37:41.340 align:start position:0%
expand that to two the town could still
 
02:37:43.790 --> 02:37:43.800 align:start position:0%
say but your lot is under a half acre
 
02:37:46.910 --> 02:37:46.920 align:start position:0%
and I think based on all of the the
 
02:37:48.950 --> 02:37:48.960 align:start position:0%
water stuff that was brought up earlier
 
02:37:51.889 --> 02:37:51.899 align:start position:0%
that that seems to be reasonable and I'm
 
02:37:55.309 --> 02:37:55.319 align:start position:0%
happy to take questions I see a hand
 
02:37:56.809 --> 02:37:56.819 align:start position:0%
um thank you representative Reed
 
02:37:56.819 --> 02:37:58.910 align:start position:0%
um thank you representative Reed
representative

02:37:58.910 --> 02:37:58.920 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:38:00.230 --> 02:38:00.240 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:38:03.050 --> 02:38:03.060 align:start position:0%
um so they're in that last paragraph
 
02:38:05.389 --> 02:38:05.399 align:start position:0%
there is some differences between the
 
02:38:05.399 --> 02:38:06.889 align:start position:0%
there is some differences between the
two

02:38:06.889 --> 02:38:06.899 align:start position:0%
two
 
02:38:08.870 --> 02:38:08.880 align:start position:0%
um because there's no
 
02:38:11.030 --> 02:38:11.040 align:start position:0%
um second
 
02:38:14.870 --> 02:38:14.880 align:start position:0%
um unit allowed I guess and in the
 
02:38:18.590 --> 02:38:18.600 align:start position:0%
um specifically on the the other
 
02:38:23.690 --> 02:38:23.700 align:start position:0%
Amendment uh not doing the second it
 
02:38:26.030 --> 02:38:26.040 align:start position:0%
does not allow the municipality to
 
02:38:29.030 --> 02:38:29.040 align:start position:0%
require uh minimum lot size of up to
 
02:38:31.790 --> 02:38:31.800 align:start position:0%
half an uh
 
02:38:31.800 --> 02:38:34.010 align:start position:0%
half an uh
acre

02:38:34.010 --> 02:38:34.020 align:start position:0%
acre
 
02:38:36.710 --> 02:38:36.720 align:start position:0%
um I'm just
 
02:38:40.389 --> 02:38:40.399 align:start position:0%
uh I'm one
 
02:38:44.570 --> 02:38:44.580 align:start position:0%
I am not in favor of that thing I'm
 
02:38:46.610 --> 02:38:46.620 align:start position:0%
wondering if you were doing this
 
02:38:51.349 --> 02:38:51.359 align:start position:0%
language on 19 and 20 because like as a
 
02:38:54.530 --> 02:38:54.540 align:start position:0%
as something to try and get the the
 
02:38:56.450 --> 02:38:56.460 align:start position:0%
towns to be
 
02:38:59.570 --> 02:38:59.580 align:start position:0%
in support of because it's right now you
 
02:39:03.950 --> 02:39:03.960 align:start position:0%
can have uh accessory dwelling unit
 
02:39:06.349 --> 02:39:06.359 align:start position:0%
whether or not you have a half acre or
 
02:39:06.359 --> 02:39:07.490 align:start position:0%
whether or not you have a half acre or
not

02:39:07.490 --> 02:39:07.500 align:start position:0%
not
 
02:39:11.630 --> 02:39:11.640 align:start position:0%
um and so this
 
02:39:17.210 --> 02:39:17.220 align:start position:0%
you are in 8 19 and 20 or 19 and 20 it
 
02:39:18.530 --> 02:39:18.540 align:start position:0%
just says a municipality may require
 
02:39:21.050 --> 02:39:21.060 align:start position:0%
property to have a minimum lot size of
 
02:39:24.050 --> 02:39:24.060 align:start position:0%
up to half an acre to have more than oh
 
02:39:26.750 --> 02:39:26.760 align:start position:0%
more than one okay more than one well so
 
02:39:29.510 --> 02:39:29.520 align:start position:0%
just so I I'm on record so yeah we're
 
02:39:33.110 --> 02:39:33.120 align:start position:0%
not I I very very explicitly told OLS
 
02:39:35.750 --> 02:39:35.760 align:start position:0%
repeatedly over this bill and all of the
 
02:39:38.030 --> 02:39:38.040 align:start position:0%
Amendments I do not want to touch our
 
02:39:41.450 --> 02:39:41.460 align:start position:0%
one Adu buy right at all whatsoever that
 
02:39:44.450 --> 02:39:44.460 align:start position:0%
is not touched in any segment or any
 
02:39:46.790 --> 02:39:46.800 align:start position:0%
version of any bill
 
02:39:48.650 --> 02:39:48.660 align:start position:0%
um what this is doing and you're right
 
02:39:51.650 --> 02:39:51.660 align:start position:0%
that this was a bit of a sweetener and a
 
02:39:53.510 --> 02:39:53.520 align:start position:0%
compromise to say
 
02:39:56.090 --> 02:39:56.100 align:start position:0%
yes I understand that some people are
 
02:39:59.389 --> 02:39:59.399 align:start position:0%
worried about super dense neighborhoods
 
02:40:02.150 --> 02:40:02.160 align:start position:0%
popping up and this is to say look a
 
02:40:04.190 --> 02:40:04.200 align:start position:0%
half acre is pretty reasonable to have
 
02:40:07.010 --> 02:40:07.020 align:start position:0%
that you know one structure that's the
 
02:40:09.290 --> 02:40:09.300 align:start position:0%
primary structure with an attached Adu
 
02:40:11.330 --> 02:40:11.340 align:start position:0%
that you can't even really visually
 
02:40:13.670 --> 02:40:13.680 align:start position:0%
delineate is an Adu necessarily and then
 
02:40:16.070 --> 02:40:16.080 align:start position:0%
maybe one extra outbuilding
 
02:40:18.110 --> 02:40:18.120 align:start position:0%
um a half acre is reasonable for that
 
02:40:20.630 --> 02:40:20.640 align:start position:0%
and it not overly dense it still looks
 
02:40:23.570 --> 02:40:23.580 align:start position:0%
very very rural so everything in this
 
02:40:25.250 --> 02:40:25.260 align:start position:0%
everything about this is about gentle
 
02:40:27.590 --> 02:40:27.600 align:start position:0%
density so no it's uh this you're right
 
02:40:30.050 --> 02:40:30.060 align:start position:0%
that this was a kind of a compromise
 
02:40:32.750 --> 02:40:32.760 align:start position:0%
that I put in but it does not impact the
 
02:40:34.790 --> 02:40:34.800 align:start position:0%
one Adu we have by right okay thank you
 
02:40:37.910 --> 02:40:37.920 align:start position:0%
and um representative Reed I
 
02:40:41.349 --> 02:40:41.359 align:start position:0%
we don't know a lot about New Hampshire
 
02:40:44.510 --> 02:40:44.520 align:start position:0%
adus because we don't have a database or
 
02:40:45.590 --> 02:40:45.600 align:start position:0%
any research on it I think that's
 
02:40:47.929 --> 02:40:47.939 align:start position:0%
something that um Noha just brought up
 
02:40:50.450 --> 02:40:50.460 align:start position:0%
um when he presented but I guess
 
02:40:50.460 --> 02:40:51.650 align:start position:0%
um when he presented but I guess
um

02:40:51.650 --> 02:40:51.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:40:52.910 --> 02:40:52.920 align:start position:0%
I don't
 
02:40:55.250 --> 02:40:55.260 align:start position:0%
I don't even see with this bill that
 
02:40:56.809 --> 02:40:56.819 align:start position:0%
there would be just a bunch of ads
 
02:40:58.610 --> 02:40:58.620 align:start position:0%
popping up everywhere in like single
 
02:41:00.530 --> 02:41:00.540 align:start position:0%
family neighborhoods I think that the
 
02:41:03.469 --> 02:41:03.479 align:start position:0%
way that you I I really think on page 3
 
02:41:06.230 --> 02:41:06.240 align:start position:0%
19 and 20 I think that helps address if
 
02:41:07.429 --> 02:41:07.439 align:start position:0%
you're going to have more than one it's
 
02:41:09.590 --> 02:41:09.600 align:start position:0%
going to be on a minimum acre lot and I
 
02:41:11.030 --> 02:41:11.040 align:start position:0%
think that
 
02:41:13.969 --> 02:41:13.979 align:start position:0%
is a very good sweetener compromise in
 
02:41:15.230 --> 02:41:15.240 align:start position:0%
this amendment and I didn't I don't
 
02:41:17.929 --> 02:41:17.939 align:start position:0%
remember seeing it on previous versions
 
02:41:23.090 --> 02:41:23.100 align:start position:0%
uh this was in the original uh 423
 
02:41:24.770 --> 02:41:24.780 align:start position:0%
um however I completely agree with you
 
02:41:27.230 --> 02:41:27.240 align:start position:0%
Mr chair that part of the gentle density
 
02:41:29.150 --> 02:41:29.160 align:start position:0%
of this isn't just the visual impact
 
02:41:30.950 --> 02:41:30.960 align:start position:0%
that it's not you know you're spreading
 
02:41:32.929 --> 02:41:32.939 align:start position:0%
out the increased units we need for our
 
02:41:35.450 --> 02:41:35.460 align:start position:0%
Market rather than having several large
 
02:41:38.150 --> 02:41:38.160 align:start position:0%
complexes go up that total 60 000 units
 
02:41:40.570 --> 02:41:40.580 align:start position:0%
you'll have this kind of victory garden
 
02:41:44.510 --> 02:41:44.520 align:start position:0%
decentralized approach to increased uh
 
02:41:47.809 --> 02:41:47.819 align:start position:0%
increased units on the market but in
 
02:41:49.730 --> 02:41:49.740 align:start position:0%
addition to that as you pointed out it's
 
02:41:52.070 --> 02:41:52.080 align:start position:0%
not like everyone who
 
02:41:54.830 --> 02:41:54.840 align:start position:0%
um is able to have an Adu is going to
 
02:41:57.349 --> 02:41:57.359 align:start position:0%
build the next day this is going to be
 
02:42:00.590 --> 02:42:00.600 align:start position:0%
slowly over time and it's something that
 
02:42:03.650 --> 02:42:03.660 align:start position:0%
directly helps homeowners afford their
 
02:42:05.690 --> 02:42:05.700 align:start position:0%
mortgage whether to buy a home because
 
02:42:07.570 --> 02:42:07.580 align:start position:0%
as a a
 
02:42:11.150 --> 02:42:11.160 align:start position:0%
aspiring home buyer myself I know that
 
02:42:13.250 --> 02:42:13.260 align:start position:0%
the ability to build an Adu is going to
 
02:42:15.110 --> 02:42:15.120 align:start position:0%
help me defray the cost of the mortgage
 
02:42:17.690 --> 02:42:17.700 align:start position:0%
but also especially as people retire and
 
02:42:20.030 --> 02:42:20.040 align:start position:0%
now they're faced with property taxes
 
02:42:22.250 --> 02:42:22.260 align:start position:0%
that are continuing to go up having an
 
02:42:25.309 --> 02:42:25.319 align:start position:0%
Adu helps them stay in their home and
 
02:42:29.630 --> 02:42:29.640 align:start position:0%
not have to sell and downsize so
 
02:42:31.429 --> 02:42:31.439 align:start position:0%
um so yeah it's not going to happen
 
02:42:33.170 --> 02:42:33.180 align:start position:0%
overnight but it's something that helps
 
02:42:38.750 --> 02:42:38.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:38.760 --> 02:42:40.309 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:42:40.309 --> 02:42:40.319 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:42:41.750 --> 02:42:41.760 align:start position:0%
um where's the rest of the committee on
 
02:42:43.790 --> 02:42:43.800 align:start position:0%
this any feedback for representative
 
02:42:47.270 --> 02:42:47.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:52.330 --> 02:42:52.340 align:start position:0%
I'm fully in support of the 2adu version
 
02:42:55.370 --> 02:42:55.380 align:start position:0%
for all the reasons stated
 
02:42:57.770 --> 02:42:57.780 align:start position:0%
um and I would further note I went to a
 
02:42:59.750 --> 02:42:59.760 align:start position:0%
workshop last spring
 
02:43:03.110 --> 02:43:03.120 align:start position:0%
on putting adus that was co-hosted
 
02:43:05.570 --> 02:43:05.580 align:start position:0%
across New Hampshire Vermont border
 
02:43:07.550 --> 02:43:07.560 align:start position:0%
and one of the realities that was
 
02:43:11.210 --> 02:43:11.220 align:start position:0%
presented by several different folks
 
02:43:14.030 --> 02:43:14.040 align:start position:0%
adus are not inexpensive to build
 
02:43:17.210 --> 02:43:17.220 align:start position:0%
so we're not going to have an onslaught
 
02:43:20.270 --> 02:43:20.280 align:start position:0%
of them in existing homes
 
02:43:22.550 --> 02:43:22.560 align:start position:0%
there's really Nationwide data about
 
02:43:22.560 --> 02:43:24.110 align:start position:0%
there's really Nationwide data about
that

02:43:24.110 --> 02:43:24.120 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:43:25.849 --> 02:43:25.859 align:start position:0%
um and I could find a link and send to
 
02:43:26.929 --> 02:43:26.939 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
02:43:29.330 --> 02:43:29.340 align:start position:0%
but I think this is a small part of our
 
02:43:31.969 --> 02:43:31.979 align:start position:0%
solution and it's creative
 
02:43:34.309 --> 02:43:34.319 align:start position:0%
it's good for young people as well as
 
02:43:36.290 --> 02:43:36.300 align:start position:0%
old people old people get to stay in
 
02:43:37.969 --> 02:43:37.979 align:start position:0%
their homes more affordably and pay
 
02:43:39.710 --> 02:43:39.720 align:start position:0%
those taxes or if they still have a
 
02:43:41.330 --> 02:43:41.340 align:start position:0%
mortgage which is a surprising number of
 
02:43:43.730 --> 02:43:43.740 align:start position:0%
seniors do still have mortgages
 
02:43:45.830 --> 02:43:45.840 align:start position:0%
and for younger folks it makes them more
 
02:43:48.590 --> 02:43:48.600 align:start position:0%
able to become homeowners so I fully
 
02:43:49.790 --> 02:43:49.800 align:start position:0%
supported them
 
02:43:51.830 --> 02:43:51.840 align:start position:0%
representative lines up I fully support
 
02:43:53.389 --> 02:43:53.399 align:start position:0%
it sounds like a really great plan
 
02:43:56.450 --> 02:43:56.460 align:start position:0%
number two okay yep there's two versions
 
02:43:58.190 --> 02:43:58.200 align:start position:0%
of this amendment so are you saying you
 
02:44:00.349 --> 02:44:00.359 align:start position:0%
support both versions
 
02:44:02.330 --> 02:44:02.340 align:start position:0%
yes representative Damon representative
 
02:44:04.969 --> 02:44:04.979 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I support it all
 
02:44:07.429 --> 02:44:07.439 align:start position:0%
so I think there's a such a shortage of
 
02:44:09.530 --> 02:44:09.540 align:start position:0%
rentals out there
 
02:44:11.750 --> 02:44:11.760 align:start position:0%
um I know a lot of people who have had
 
02:44:11.760 --> 02:44:12.530 align:start position:0%
um I know a lot of people who have had
to

02:44:12.530 --> 02:44:12.540 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:44:14.450 --> 02:44:14.460 align:start position:0%
move out of town to go live with their
 
02:44:17.330 --> 02:44:17.340 align:start position:0%
parents because they can't afford the
 
02:44:20.210 --> 02:44:20.220 align:start position:0%
rents in Manchester but um the rental
 
02:44:23.210 --> 02:44:23.220 align:start position:0%
market is very bad in Manchester people
 
02:44:25.070 --> 02:44:25.080 align:start position:0%
are going up like crazy on the rent
 
02:44:28.130 --> 02:44:28.140 align:start position:0%
young people can't afford it this gives
 
02:44:30.770 --> 02:44:30.780 align:start position:0%
an opportunity for a family to
 
02:44:34.010 --> 02:44:34.020 align:start position:0%
Turn part of their property into an Adu
 
02:44:36.290 --> 02:44:36.300 align:start position:0%
and bring their children home some
 
02:44:37.730 --> 02:44:37.740 align:start position:0%
people don't want to move back in with
 
02:44:40.630 --> 02:44:40.640 align:start position:0%
their parents because they have a
 
02:44:42.830 --> 02:44:42.840 align:start position:0%
significant other or whatever and they
 
02:44:44.510 --> 02:44:44.520 align:start position:0%
just don't want to bring that person
 
02:44:48.290 --> 02:44:48.300 align:start position:0%
home but with an Adu it makes it a lot
 
02:44:50.750 --> 02:44:50.760 align:start position:0%
more comfortable for people to even
 
02:44:53.230 --> 02:44:53.240 align:start position:0%
bring the family together in many cases
 
02:44:55.910 --> 02:44:55.920 align:start position:0%
I could name a half a dozen people that
 
02:44:58.010 --> 02:44:58.020 align:start position:0%
have had to move out of town because
 
02:45:00.830 --> 02:45:00.840 align:start position:0%
they have to go back with their parents
 
02:45:04.429 --> 02:45:04.439 align:start position:0%
and just this would really take that
 
02:45:06.349 --> 02:45:06.359 align:start position:0%
part of the pressure off a lot of young
 
02:45:08.630 --> 02:45:08.640 align:start position:0%
people young people can't afford to buy
 
02:45:11.389 --> 02:45:11.399 align:start position:0%
interest rates are up uh we do have that
 
02:45:13.790 --> 02:45:13.800 align:start position:0%
new mortgage with one percent down but
 
02:45:16.190 --> 02:45:16.200 align:start position:0%
now you're you're financing all money so
 
02:45:18.889 --> 02:45:18.899 align:start position:0%
I don't know you know it's a catch-22
 
02:45:18.899 --> 02:45:19.790 align:start position:0%
I don't know you know it's a catch-22
there

02:45:19.790 --> 02:45:19.800 align:start position:0%
there
 
02:45:22.130 --> 02:45:22.140 align:start position:0%
I'm in support of this I think it might
 
02:45:26.030 --> 02:45:26.040 align:start position:0%
be a short fix uh for now but um I think
 
02:45:28.490 --> 02:45:28.500 align:start position:0%
it'll be beneficial to everyone
 
02:45:30.110 --> 02:45:30.120 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:45:30.120 --> 02:45:31.309 align:start position:0%
thank you
okay

02:45:31.309 --> 02:45:31.319 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:45:33.590 --> 02:45:33.600 align:start position:0%
represent Walsh
 
02:45:35.809 --> 02:45:35.819 align:start position:0%
I knew you were coming I'm working
 
02:45:37.429 --> 02:45:37.439 align:start position:0%
around the table yeah
 
02:45:39.349 --> 02:45:39.359 align:start position:0%
um I appreciate all the work that's gone
 
02:45:42.050 --> 02:45:42.060 align:start position:0%
into this and and the creativity I still
 
02:45:44.929 --> 02:45:44.939 align:start position:0%
cannot support it I I look at
 
02:45:47.510 --> 02:45:47.520 align:start position:0%
the accessory dwelling units that are in
 
02:45:49.309 --> 02:45:49.319 align:start position:0%
current statute and understand and have
 
02:45:51.830 --> 02:45:51.840 align:start position:0%
no opposition to them uh accessory
 
02:45:53.990 --> 02:45:54.000 align:start position:0%
dwelling unit that's why the door was in
 
02:45:56.330 --> 02:45:56.340 align:start position:0%
between the two units for family for for
 
02:46:00.110 --> 02:46:00.120 align:start position:0%
uh for for parents in-laws Etc this bill
 
02:46:01.610 --> 02:46:01.620 align:start position:0%
basically takes your single family
 
02:46:04.370 --> 02:46:04.380 align:start position:0%
neighborhoods or allows actually no it
 
02:46:08.150 --> 02:46:08.160 align:start position:0%
by right anybody that lives in a single
 
02:46:10.550 --> 02:46:10.560 align:start position:0%
family neighborhood which people like
 
02:46:12.590 --> 02:46:12.600 align:start position:0%
them that's why they shop there and buy
 
02:46:12.600 --> 02:46:13.490 align:start position:0%
them that's why they shop there and buy
their

02:46:13.490 --> 02:46:13.500 align:start position:0%
their
 
02:46:15.410 --> 02:46:15.420 align:start position:0%
uh they're invested in their
 
02:46:17.389 --> 02:46:17.399 align:start position:0%
neighborhoods they know everybody and it
 
02:46:21.070 --> 02:46:21.080 align:start position:0%
turns it into a potential apartment
 
02:46:24.650 --> 02:46:24.660 align:start position:0%
type of development and I just I don't
 
02:46:27.050 --> 02:46:27.060 align:start position:0%
see the the commingling and I look at
 
02:46:28.610 --> 02:46:28.620 align:start position:0%
something like this and if a
 
02:46:30.469 --> 02:46:30.479 align:start position:0%
municipality wanted to adopt something
 
02:46:32.270 --> 02:46:32.280 align:start position:0%
like this and the people in their Town
 
02:46:33.889 --> 02:46:33.899 align:start position:0%
said yeah that's a great idea let's do
 
02:46:38.150 --> 02:46:38.160 align:start position:0%
it by all means but for us as a state to
 
02:46:41.030 --> 02:46:41.040 align:start position:0%
look at every city and town in this
 
02:46:43.910 --> 02:46:43.920 align:start position:0%
state as a government and say this is
 
02:46:46.250 --> 02:46:46.260 align:start position:0%
what you need to do or need to allow I
 
02:46:48.050 --> 02:46:48.060 align:start position:0%
just think it goes too far for me so
 
02:46:51.230 --> 02:46:51.240 align:start position:0%
I'll leave it at that yeah and I'm just
 
02:46:53.150 --> 02:46:53.160 align:start position:0%
so the May
 
02:46:55.370 --> 02:46:55.380 align:start position:0%
don't we have to enable municipality or
 
02:46:57.530 --> 02:46:57.540 align:start position:0%
to adopt these regulations first before
 
02:47:02.030 --> 02:47:02.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:03.469 --> 02:47:03.479 align:start position:0%
so that's kind of I stand correct
 
02:47:06.050 --> 02:47:06.060 align:start position:0%
language in here is is that but um I'm
 
02:47:08.270 --> 02:47:08.280 align:start position:0%
gonna let representative McConkey jump
 
02:47:10.070 --> 02:47:10.080 align:start position:0%
in first and then go back around the
 
02:47:10.080 --> 02:47:10.969 align:start position:0%
in first and then go back around the
table

02:47:10.969 --> 02:47:10.979 align:start position:0%
table
 
02:47:13.849 --> 02:47:13.859 align:start position:0%
thank you um I will um
 
02:47:17.090 --> 02:47:17.100 align:start position:0%
I will support this I
 
02:47:21.410 --> 02:47:21.420 align:start position:0%
um we have a tremendous need for housing
 
02:47:24.590 --> 02:47:24.600 align:start position:0%
um I think allowing people to age in
 
02:47:26.929 --> 02:47:26.939 align:start position:0%
place is hugely important I can name you
 
02:47:30.230 --> 02:47:30.240 align:start position:0%
Lake after Lake after Lake in my region
 
02:47:33.650 --> 02:47:33.660 align:start position:0%
that as the tax burden goes higher and
 
02:47:36.530 --> 02:47:36.540 align:start position:0%
higher the families and mom and dad who
 
02:47:38.690 --> 02:47:38.700 align:start position:0%
have been there since they swam and the
 
02:47:42.290 --> 02:47:42.300 align:start position:0%
thing as a kid have to move out so I I
 
02:47:45.010 --> 02:47:45.020 align:start position:0%
was fully supportive Adu I'll go to two
 
02:47:48.110 --> 02:47:48.120 align:start position:0%
I think if you had done this instead of
 
02:47:51.410 --> 02:47:51.420 align:start position:0%
trying to get five we would already have
 
02:47:54.950 --> 02:47:54.960 align:start position:0%
this right now so I will wholeheartedly
 
02:47:59.030 --> 02:47:59.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:02.270 --> 02:48:02.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:04.190 --> 02:48:04.200 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:48:04.200 --> 02:48:05.090 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

02:48:05.090 --> 02:48:05.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:48:06.770 --> 02:48:06.780 align:start position:0%
I think I think the representative might
 
02:48:08.690 --> 02:48:08.700 align:start position:0%
be referring to the fourplex bill which
 
02:48:11.809 --> 02:48:11.819 align:start position:0%
was not mine but mine was always two but
 
02:48:14.030 --> 02:48:14.040 align:start position:0%
that's fine uh
 
02:48:16.190 --> 02:48:16.200 align:start position:0%
uh but that's fine
 
02:48:18.530 --> 02:48:18.540 align:start position:0%
um I do appreciate the comments I I will
 
02:48:20.210 --> 02:48:20.220 align:start position:0%
just add that
 
02:48:24.469 --> 02:48:24.479 align:start position:0%
um the expansion from one by right which
 
02:48:26.210 --> 02:48:26.220 align:start position:0%
I I'll further record that was a bill
 
02:48:28.370 --> 02:48:28.380 align:start position:0%
that was put in by Republicans
 
02:48:30.050 --> 02:48:30.060 align:start position:0%
um and of course I support but the
 
02:48:32.210 --> 02:48:32.220 align:start position:0%
expansion from one by right to to two by
 
02:48:35.270 --> 02:48:35.280 align:start position:0%
right um what that really allows is to
 
02:48:36.889 --> 02:48:36.899 align:start position:0%
have that family member that you were
 
02:48:39.230 --> 02:48:39.240 align:start position:0%
talking about and the current law does
 
02:48:42.290 --> 02:48:42.300 align:start position:0%
not restrict to family members it's very
 
02:48:44.510 --> 02:48:44.520 align:start position:0%
clear that it cannot be restricted to
 
02:48:47.210 --> 02:48:47.220 align:start position:0%
family members and can they already can
 
02:48:50.630 --> 02:48:50.640 align:start position:0%
and are rented and rooms in homes in
 
02:48:53.030 --> 02:48:53.040 align:start position:0%
single-family homes just the rooms are
 
02:48:56.030 --> 02:48:56.040 align:start position:0%
also rented so that's none of that is
 
02:48:57.889 --> 02:48:57.899 align:start position:0%
being impacted that's already in place
 
02:48:59.929 --> 02:48:59.939 align:start position:0%
that's already happening but what this
 
02:49:02.809 --> 02:49:02.819 align:start position:0%
does allow is for someone to not only
 
02:49:05.750 --> 02:49:05.760 align:start position:0%
bring that family member in but also
 
02:49:08.690 --> 02:49:08.700 align:start position:0%
help defray their own mortgage costs as
 
02:49:11.270 --> 02:49:11.280 align:start position:0%
well as adding a unit to not only the
 
02:49:14.030 --> 02:49:14.040 align:start position:0%
market but specifically a Workforce
 
02:49:17.150 --> 02:49:17.160 align:start position:0%
housing level unit to the market which
 
02:49:19.969 --> 02:49:19.979 align:start position:0%
is super important to bring down costs
 
02:49:22.370 --> 02:49:22.380 align:start position:0%
because sixty thousand units adding 60
 
02:49:23.690 --> 02:49:23.700 align:start position:0%
000 units to the market won't do
 
02:49:25.849 --> 02:49:25.859 align:start position:0%
anything if those units are not
 
02:49:25.859 --> 02:49:27.110 align:start position:0%
anything if those units are not
affordable

02:49:27.110 --> 02:49:27.120 align:start position:0%
affordable
 
02:49:27.120 --> 02:49:28.610 align:start position:0%
affordable
so

02:49:28.610 --> 02:49:28.620 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:49:31.849 --> 02:49:31.859 align:start position:0%
um and again as was already pointed out
 
02:49:34.550 --> 02:49:34.560 align:start position:0%
by other Representatives it's it is not
 
02:49:37.849 --> 02:49:37.859 align:start position:0%
easy to build a new Adu if you're
 
02:49:39.230 --> 02:49:39.240 align:start position:0%
building a new structure and it's not
 
02:49:41.870 --> 02:49:41.880 align:start position:0%
like a garage or a barn and even then
 
02:49:44.330 --> 02:49:44.340 align:start position:0%
it's not easy or cheap so it's not like
 
02:49:46.610 --> 02:49:46.620 align:start position:0%
an entire neighborhood all of a sudden
 
02:49:49.190 --> 02:49:49.200 align:start position:0%
every single house is going to have an
 
02:49:50.990 --> 02:49:51.000 align:start position:0%
extra Adu
 
02:49:52.670 --> 02:49:52.680 align:start position:0%
um and certainly the visual impact even
 
02:49:54.650 --> 02:49:54.660 align:start position:0%
if that happened eventually wouldn't it
 
02:49:56.630 --> 02:49:56.640 align:start position:0%
would still look very rural but it's not
 
02:49:58.190 --> 02:49:58.200 align:start position:0%
like you're going to change the nature
 
02:50:00.830 --> 02:50:00.840 align:start position:0%
of an entire neighborhood and I guess
 
02:50:02.690 --> 02:50:02.700 align:start position:0%
I'll leave it at that and I appreciate
 
02:50:05.330 --> 02:50:05.340 align:start position:0%
the time Mr chair I think so I grew up
 
02:50:07.790 --> 02:50:07.800 align:start position:0%
in Concord and uh I grew up in a single
 
02:50:08.870 --> 02:50:08.880 align:start position:0%
family neighborhood and I think our
 
02:50:11.030 --> 02:50:11.040 align:start position:0%
Acres were like a quarter of a lot but
 
02:50:12.410 --> 02:50:12.420 align:start position:0%
it still had kind of the single family
 
02:50:15.469 --> 02:50:15.479 align:start position:0%
neighborhood Vibe so I mean a half acre
 
02:50:18.230 --> 02:50:18.240 align:start position:0%
is a lot of space it's a in my opinion
 
02:50:20.570 --> 02:50:20.580 align:start position:0%
it's a lot of space and and it's not
 
02:50:24.110 --> 02:50:24.120 align:start position:0%
usually the typical size of a a lot in a
 
02:50:25.790 --> 02:50:25.800 align:start position:0%
single family neighborhood
 
02:50:28.429 --> 02:50:28.439 align:start position:0%
and I'll just add to that Mr chair very
 
02:50:30.650 --> 02:50:30.660 align:start position:0%
briefly that what this is really going
 
02:50:32.990 --> 02:50:33.000 align:start position:0%
to impact is not the municipal lots that
 
02:50:34.550 --> 02:50:34.560 align:start position:0%
are an eighth of an acre obviously for
 
02:50:36.650 --> 02:50:36.660 align:start position:0%
that very reason but as we've talked
 
02:50:38.650 --> 02:50:38.660 align:start position:0%
about the very kind of
 
02:50:41.270 --> 02:50:41.280 align:start position:0%
overburdensome lot minimum requirements
 
02:50:44.389 --> 02:50:44.399 align:start position:0%
in so many uh towns five acres 10 acres
 
02:50:46.370 --> 02:50:46.380 align:start position:0%
20 acres and what this allows is
 
02:50:48.469 --> 02:50:48.479 align:start position:0%
actually a little bit more housing on
 
02:50:52.309 --> 02:50:52.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:55.730 --> 02:50:55.740 align:start position:0%
represent Walsh and I I'm not welcoming
 
02:50:58.010 --> 02:50:58.020 align:start position:0%
a debate on this again uh I just want to
 
02:51:01.190 --> 02:51:01.200 align:start position:0%
make a comment I my my lot is 0.6 Acres
 
02:51:02.870 --> 02:51:02.880 align:start position:0%
it may look like a lot of space until
 
02:51:04.610 --> 02:51:04.620 align:start position:0%
you put a thousand square foot house in
 
02:51:06.530 --> 02:51:06.540 align:start position:0%
the middle of it then it's no longer a
 
02:51:09.230 --> 02:51:09.240 align:start position:0%
big space that is not a large piece of
 
02:51:11.510 --> 02:51:11.520 align:start position:0%
property so I guess it's all a matter of
 
02:51:13.969 --> 02:51:13.979 align:start position:0%
perspective uh on this type of
 
02:51:16.070 --> 02:51:16.080 align:start position:0%
discussion and I just think this goes
 
02:51:17.690 --> 02:51:17.700 align:start position:0%
too far from what we already have that's
 
02:51:20.870 --> 02:51:20.880 align:start position:0%
all yep and that's okay I think I I do
 
02:51:23.570 --> 02:51:23.580 align:start position:0%
want to thank representative Reed for
 
02:51:25.670 --> 02:51:25.680 align:start position:0%
going to the drawing board three or four
 
02:51:27.830 --> 02:51:27.840 align:start position:0%
or five times and listening to the views
 
02:51:28.910 --> 02:51:28.920 align:start position:0%
of the committee
 
02:51:30.230 --> 02:51:30.240 align:start position:0%
um it's definitely made me more
 
02:51:32.469 --> 02:51:32.479 align:start position:0%
comfortable I'm happy to co-sponsor
 
02:51:34.610 --> 02:51:34.620 align:start position:0%
whichever one you decide to introduce
 
02:51:38.090 --> 02:51:38.100 align:start position:0%
God representative
 
02:51:39.889 --> 02:51:39.899 align:start position:0%
um I guess
 
02:51:42.710 --> 02:51:42.720 align:start position:0%
I didn't hear
 
02:51:45.710 --> 02:51:45.720 align:start position:0%
um any thoughts from representative
 
02:51:49.190 --> 02:51:49.200 align:start position:0%
Walsh about one versus another if one
 
02:51:51.410 --> 02:51:51.420 align:start position:0%
would be able to be supported versus
 
02:51:54.530 --> 02:51:54.540 align:start position:0%
another because it seems like if he
 
02:51:56.570 --> 02:51:56.580 align:start position:0%
opposed to both of them there's no
 
02:51:59.929 --> 02:51:59.939 align:start position:0%
reason to go with the non-2-1 right if
 
02:52:02.929 --> 02:52:02.939 align:start position:0%
he's if he's supportive of the non-2-1
 
02:52:04.969 --> 02:52:04.979 align:start position:0%
that fixes some other things then maybe
 
02:52:06.650 --> 02:52:06.660 align:start position:0%
there might be incentive for a
 
02:52:09.110 --> 02:52:09.120 align:start position:0%
representative Reed to choose that one
 
02:52:13.070 --> 02:52:13.080 align:start position:0%
as or if she you know when she's
 
02:52:15.170 --> 02:52:15.180 align:start position:0%
considering filing legislation that
 
02:52:18.230 --> 02:52:18.240 align:start position:0%
would be important information I think I
 
02:52:20.450 --> 02:52:20.460 align:start position:0%
didn't hear that from him so I I would
 
02:52:21.410 --> 02:52:21.420 align:start position:0%
be interested
 
02:52:24.050 --> 02:52:24.060 align:start position:0%
representative Reed with the blessing of
 
02:52:26.330 --> 02:52:26.340 align:start position:0%
the committee and to simplify our work
 
02:52:28.429 --> 02:52:28.439 align:start position:0%
in the spring
 
02:52:30.889 --> 02:52:30.899 align:start position:0%
um I think it might be wise to just put
 
02:52:35.269 --> 02:52:35.279 align:start position:0%
in the one version and then have the uh
 
02:52:37.730 --> 02:52:37.740 align:start position:0%
Amendment available should the committee
 
02:52:39.530 --> 02:52:39.540 align:start position:0%
eventually decide to get rid of the two
 
02:52:42.950 --> 02:52:42.960 align:start position:0%
and go with all of the other pieces but
 
02:52:44.150 --> 02:52:44.160 align:start position:0%
at least you will have that language
 
02:52:47.690 --> 02:52:47.700 align:start position:0%
available to amend the bill but I can
 
02:52:49.130 --> 02:52:49.140 align:start position:0%
just put in the whole kit and caboodle
 
02:52:50.570 --> 02:52:50.580 align:start position:0%
in that way we're dealing with one bill
 
02:52:52.070 --> 02:52:52.080 align:start position:0%
instead of two bills
 
02:52:53.809 --> 02:52:53.819 align:start position:0%
yes and we haven't heard from the public
 
02:52:54.889 --> 02:52:54.899 align:start position:0%
on this
 
02:52:57.230 --> 02:52:57.240 align:start position:0%
specific legislation so that's a good
 
02:52:58.670 --> 02:52:58.680 align:start position:0%
good idea
 
02:52:59.809 --> 02:52:59.819 align:start position:0%
um representative wall should you want
 
02:53:01.370 --> 02:53:01.380 align:start position:0%
to jump in on that yeah thank you well
 
02:53:04.070 --> 02:53:04.080 align:start position:0%
first of all I did I just got the uh PDF
 
02:53:06.710 --> 02:53:06.720 align:start position:0%
copies of these this morning at 4 30 I
 
02:53:08.690 --> 02:53:08.700 align:start position:0%
did not have a chance and I haven't read
 
02:53:11.210 --> 02:53:11.220 align:start position:0%
the second one which is two six two two
 
02:53:13.190 --> 02:53:13.200 align:start position:0%
six one-h
 
02:53:15.530 --> 02:53:15.540 align:start position:0%
um skimming it over real quick
 
02:53:17.450 --> 02:53:17.460 align:start position:0%
it does not look to be as much and again
 
02:53:19.309 --> 02:53:19.319 align:start position:0%
like I said before I'm not opposed to
 
02:53:22.370 --> 02:53:22.380 align:start position:0%
making changes or amendments that remove
 
02:53:25.370 --> 02:53:25.380 align:start position:0%
a municipality's ability to make them
 
02:53:27.250 --> 02:53:27.260 align:start position:0%
impossible like the parking restrictions
 
02:53:30.950 --> 02:53:30.960 align:start position:0%
But to answer your question in public I
 
02:53:33.410 --> 02:53:33.420 align:start position:0%
have not reviewed the second one yet
 
02:53:37.010 --> 02:53:37.020 align:start position:0%
I will say that when I was going through
 
02:53:39.650 --> 02:53:39.660 align:start position:0%
the bill I I pointed out the differences
 
02:53:42.170 --> 02:53:42.180 align:start position:0%
in um basically it's identical except
 
02:53:44.809 --> 02:53:44.819 align:start position:0%
for every place that it referenced a
 
02:53:47.450 --> 02:53:47.460 align:start position:0%
second Adu buy right that that part has
 
02:53:49.550 --> 02:53:49.560 align:start position:0%
been removed and the effect of that is
 
02:53:51.469 --> 02:53:51.479 align:start position:0%
that we're also removing the ability for
 
02:53:54.170 --> 02:53:54.180 align:start position:0%
towns to enforce Workforce housing level
 
02:53:56.389 --> 02:53:56.399 align:start position:0%
rents on that second unit because we no
 
02:54:00.410 --> 02:54:00.420 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:04.370 --> 02:54:04.380 align:start position:0%
representative McConkey I would um I got
 
02:54:07.490 --> 02:54:07.500 align:start position:0%
a little lost in that conversation the
 
02:54:08.929 --> 02:54:08.939 align:start position:0%
um the amendment that I will
 
02:54:11.530 --> 02:54:11.540 align:start position:0%
wholeheartedly support is
 
02:54:15.710 --> 02:54:15.720 align:start position:0%
22608 I think if we have two too much
 
02:54:17.870 --> 02:54:17.880 align:start position:0%
out there it becomes hard to sort
 
02:54:17.880 --> 02:54:19.070 align:start position:0%
out there it becomes hard to sort
through

02:54:19.070 --> 02:54:19.080 align:start position:0%
through
 
02:54:21.290 --> 02:54:21.300 align:start position:0%
and I believe that is the amendment
 
02:54:23.570 --> 02:54:23.580 align:start position:0%
representative that handled all of your
 
02:54:26.330 --> 02:54:26.340 align:start position:0%
changes that you wanted that is correct
 
02:54:28.309 --> 02:54:28.319 align:start position:0%
that's the one that I was going through
 
02:54:30.530 --> 02:54:30.540 align:start position:0%
line by line yeah that's that's the one
 
02:54:32.389 --> 02:54:32.399 align:start position:0%
I would support okay so that's the one
 
02:54:35.230 --> 02:54:35.240 align:start position:0%
that takes a bigger bite of the Apple
 
02:54:37.610 --> 02:54:37.620 align:start position:0%
yep one big bite
 
02:54:38.510 --> 02:54:38.520 align:start position:0%
um representative Wallace and
 
02:54:41.030 --> 02:54:41.040 align:start position:0%
representative thank you the other thing
 
02:54:42.950 --> 02:54:42.960 align:start position:0%
that needs to be considered is
 
02:54:45.590 --> 02:54:45.600 align:start position:0%
it's not going to be all over the place
 
02:54:48.050 --> 02:54:48.060 align:start position:0%
as previously stated because uh you know
 
02:54:51.349 --> 02:54:51.359 align:start position:0%
a 750 to a thousand square foot Adu is
 
02:54:53.929 --> 02:54:53.939 align:start position:0%
going to cost somewhere is you know 75
 
02:54:56.809 --> 02:54:56.819 align:start position:0%
to 150 000 to construct and there's also
 
02:54:58.130 --> 02:54:58.140 align:start position:0%
going to be the tax revenue to the
 
02:55:01.070 --> 02:55:01.080 align:start position:0%
municipalities uh they're from so it's
 
02:55:04.010 --> 02:55:04.020 align:start position:0%
not going to be the uh immediate cure
 
02:55:05.330 --> 02:55:05.340 align:start position:0%
that people think it's going to be
 
02:55:06.650 --> 02:55:06.660 align:start position:0%
there's going to be a cost of doing
 
02:55:08.389 --> 02:55:08.399 align:start position:0%
business with this
 
02:55:10.190 --> 02:55:10.200 align:start position:0%
um so keep that in mind folks I will
 
02:55:14.030 --> 02:55:14.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:16.250 --> 02:55:16.260 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to also make sure we noted
 
02:55:18.710 --> 02:55:18.720 align:start position:0%
that this is a way to keep
 
02:55:21.290 --> 02:55:21.300 align:start position:0%
young people post high school and post
 
02:55:23.870 --> 02:55:23.880 align:start position:0%
College in New Hampshire and we are
 
02:55:23.880 --> 02:55:25.130 align:start position:0%
College in New Hampshire and we are
losing

02:55:25.130 --> 02:55:25.140 align:start position:0%
losing
 
02:55:27.170 --> 02:55:27.180 align:start position:0%
our young population because they can't
 
02:55:30.050 --> 02:55:30.060 align:start position:0%
afford to live here and this would make
 
02:55:33.290 --> 02:55:33.300 align:start position:0%
it substantially more possible
 
02:55:33.300 --> 02:55:40.570 align:start position:0%
it substantially more possible
foreign

02:55:40.570 --> 02:55:40.580 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:43.670 --> 02:55:43.680 align:start position:0%
with you just drafting that and sending
 
02:55:45.230 --> 02:55:45.240 align:start position:0%
that to the committee
 
02:55:46.610 --> 02:55:46.620 align:start position:0%
um I guess my ask for the committee is
 
02:55:48.769 --> 02:55:48.779 align:start position:0%
do we feel like we need to meet one more
 
02:55:52.190 --> 02:55:52.200 align:start position:0%
time before drafting to go over
 
02:55:54.530 --> 02:55:54.540 align:start position:0%
um representative Wallace's language
 
02:55:56.450 --> 02:55:56.460 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna come back with another bite at
 
02:55:58.309 --> 02:55:58.319 align:start position:0%
the impact fees and then represent
 
02:56:00.530 --> 02:56:00.540 align:start position:0%
McConkey has some language and then
 
02:56:01.550 --> 02:56:01.560 align:start position:0%
maybe something coming from
 
02:56:03.290 --> 02:56:03.300 align:start position:0%
representative Walsh
 
02:56:04.849 --> 02:56:04.859 align:start position:0%
does the committee feel like we need to
 
02:56:10.429 --> 02:56:10.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:10.439 --> 02:56:11.809 align:start position:0%
 
yes

02:56:11.809 --> 02:56:11.819 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:56:15.530 --> 02:56:15.540 align:start position:0%
representative thank you Mr chair
 
02:56:15.540 --> 02:56:16.389 align:start position:0%
representative thank you Mr chair
um

02:56:16.389 --> 02:56:16.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:56:19.790 --> 02:56:19.800 align:start position:0%
I that at the last
 
02:56:19.800 --> 02:56:21.170 align:start position:0%
I that at the last
um

02:56:21.170 --> 02:56:21.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:56:25.550 --> 02:56:25.560 align:start position:0%
at the last uh meeting I had proposed
 
02:56:30.530 --> 02:56:30.540 align:start position:0%
some language as far as amending
 
02:56:34.070 --> 02:56:34.080 align:start position:0%
um what requirements there would be for
 
02:56:34.080 --> 02:56:34.790 align:start position:0%
um what requirements there would be for
um

02:56:34.790 --> 02:56:34.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:56:38.389 --> 02:56:38.399 align:start position:0%
designation of housing champion
 
02:56:38.399 --> 02:56:39.290 align:start position:0%
designation of housing champion
um

02:56:39.290 --> 02:56:39.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:56:43.070 --> 02:56:43.080 align:start position:0%
now that I kind of have a direction for
 
02:56:43.080 --> 02:56:44.269 align:start position:0%
now that I kind of have a direction for
those

02:56:44.269 --> 02:56:44.279 align:start position:0%
those
 
02:56:44.279 --> 02:56:46.130 align:start position:0%
those
um lot

02:56:46.130 --> 02:56:46.140 align:start position:0%
um lot
 
02:56:46.140 --> 02:56:47.330 align:start position:0%
um lot
um

02:56:47.330 --> 02:56:47.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:56:50.510 --> 02:56:50.520 align:start position:0%
size requirements I could do an
 
02:56:50.520 --> 02:56:52.910 align:start position:0%
size requirements I could do an
amendment

02:56:52.910 --> 02:56:52.920 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
02:56:56.690 --> 02:56:56.700 align:start position:0%
um that that incorporated those
 
02:56:59.389 --> 02:56:59.399 align:start position:0%
um I'm thinking of something along the
 
02:57:01.309 --> 02:57:01.319 align:start position:0%
lines of like
 
02:57:03.650 --> 02:57:03.660 align:start position:0%
um no more than double
 
02:57:07.570 --> 02:57:07.580 align:start position:0%
um that the suggestions from De the Des
 
02:57:10.370 --> 02:57:10.380 align:start position:0%
as far as the lot line uh lot
 
02:57:12.530 --> 02:57:12.540 align:start position:0%
requirements and
 
02:57:15.530 --> 02:57:15.540 align:start position:0%
um and also if they go lower than double
 
02:57:17.809 --> 02:57:17.819 align:start position:0%
than they're giving you know that's
 
02:57:19.730 --> 02:57:19.740 align:start position:0%
considered also
 
02:57:22.670 --> 02:57:22.680 align:start position:0%
um as as benefit for being being
 
02:57:25.790 --> 02:57:25.800 align:start position:0%
designated a housing champion and
 
02:57:28.490 --> 02:57:28.500 align:start position:0%
um I was also trying to get some
 
02:57:33.410 --> 02:57:33.420 align:start position:0%
information about how Seattle was doing
 
02:57:33.420 --> 02:57:35.510 align:start position:0%
information about how Seattle was doing
their

02:57:35.510 --> 02:57:35.520 align:start position:0%
their
 
02:57:35.520 --> 02:57:37.450 align:start position:0%
their
um

02:57:37.450 --> 02:57:37.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:57:41.570 --> 02:57:41.580 align:start position:0%
their pre-approval or kind of like
 
02:57:43.730 --> 02:57:43.740 align:start position:0%
approval of
 
02:57:46.370 --> 02:57:46.380 align:start position:0%
um designs over
 
02:57:46.380 --> 02:57:47.929 align:start position:0%
um designs over
uh

02:57:47.929 --> 02:57:47.939 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:57:51.950 --> 02:57:51.960 align:start position:0%
over that entire area for their adus I
 
02:57:55.550 --> 02:57:55.560 align:start position:0%
wanted it to be more holistic something
 
02:57:58.130 --> 02:57:58.140 align:start position:0%
that incorporated you know could be used
 
02:58:00.410 --> 02:58:00.420 align:start position:0%
for 3D printed houses or off-site built
 
02:58:02.210 --> 02:58:02.220 align:start position:0%
houses or whatever
 
02:58:02.220 --> 02:58:03.650 align:start position:0%
houses or whatever
um

02:58:03.650 --> 02:58:03.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:58:03.660 --> 02:58:05.330 align:start position:0%
um
but

02:58:05.330 --> 02:58:05.340 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:58:08.870 --> 02:58:08.880 align:start position:0%
um what I found out is that
 
02:58:11.750 --> 02:58:11.760 align:start position:0%
they didn't really pass a law they just
 
02:58:14.330 --> 02:58:14.340 align:start position:0%
they just um like their committee
 
02:58:18.170 --> 02:58:18.180 align:start position:0%
they're uh like city council or whatever
 
02:58:21.650 --> 02:58:21.660 align:start position:0%
voted to accept those
 
02:58:21.660 --> 02:58:22.370 align:start position:0%
voted to accept those
um

02:58:22.370 --> 02:58:22.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:58:25.849 --> 02:58:25.859 align:start position:0%
those uh plans and then kind of granted
 
02:58:28.910 --> 02:58:28.920 align:start position:0%
those plans some special designation and
 
02:58:32.150 --> 02:58:32.160 align:start position:0%
so I haven't really found anywhere that
 
02:58:35.210 --> 02:58:35.220 align:start position:0%
is doing that same type of thing but
 
02:58:35.220 --> 02:58:36.230 align:start position:0%
is doing that same type of thing but
um

02:58:36.230 --> 02:58:36.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:58:38.150 --> 02:58:38.160 align:start position:0%
I still kind of want to move forward
 
02:58:39.769 --> 02:58:39.779 align:start position:0%
with that
 
02:58:39.779 --> 02:58:40.389 align:start position:0%
with that
um

02:58:40.389 --> 02:58:40.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:58:43.429 --> 02:58:43.439 align:start position:0%
and maybe
 
02:58:43.439 --> 02:58:45.590 align:start position:0%
and maybe
um

02:58:45.590 --> 02:58:45.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:48.710 --> 02:58:48.720 align:start position:0%
see if I could have like a committee
 
02:58:51.230 --> 02:58:51.240 align:start position:0%
um that might accept and approve those
 
02:58:53.570 --> 02:58:53.580 align:start position:0%
types of things maybe
 
02:58:55.969 --> 02:58:55.979 align:start position:0%
um utilizing maybe I need to talk with
 
02:58:58.550 --> 02:58:58.560 align:start position:0%
like the plan the regional planning
 
02:58:58.560 --> 02:59:00.230 align:start position:0%
like the plan the regional planning
um

02:59:00.230 --> 02:59:00.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:59:02.929 --> 02:59:02.939 align:start position:0%
people as far as
 
02:59:05.750 --> 02:59:05.760 align:start position:0%
maybe who would be the
 
02:59:07.670 --> 02:59:07.680 align:start position:0%
how that might be structured or
 
02:59:09.349 --> 02:59:09.359 align:start position:0%
something like that my suggestion is
 
02:59:11.150 --> 02:59:11.160 align:start position:0%
that you reach out to the the housing
 
02:59:13.010 --> 02:59:13.020 align:start position:0%
Champion program was one that was just
 
02:59:15.110 --> 02:59:15.120 align:start position:0%
created yeah I recommend you reach out
 
02:59:16.250 --> 02:59:16.260 align:start position:0%
it was on
 
02:59:19.130 --> 02:59:19.140 align:start position:0%
office of professional
 
02:59:20.870 --> 02:59:20.880 align:start position:0%
planning okay office of planning and
 
02:59:23.150 --> 02:59:23.160 align:start position:0%
development and ask them they're they're
 
02:59:27.050 --> 02:59:27.060 align:start position:0%
currently in the rulemaking process to
 
02:59:27.060 --> 02:59:28.330 align:start position:0%
currently in the rulemaking process to
um

02:59:28.330 --> 02:59:28.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:59:30.710 --> 02:59:30.720 align:start position:0%
establish the rules on on
 
02:59:33.590 --> 02:59:33.600 align:start position:0%
how a housing Champion is created like
 
02:59:35.150 --> 02:59:35.160 align:start position:0%
what municipalities become happy
 
02:59:35.160 --> 02:59:36.469 align:start position:0%
what municipalities become happy
Champions

02:59:36.469 --> 02:59:36.479 align:start position:0%
Champions
 
02:59:38.150 --> 02:59:38.160 align:start position:0%
um so I would have a conversation with
 
02:59:39.170 --> 02:59:39.180 align:start position:0%
them around what they're doing the
 
02:59:41.269 --> 02:59:41.279 align:start position:0%
rulemaking process and if there needs to
 
02:59:42.170 --> 02:59:42.180 align:start position:0%
be like
 
02:59:44.870 --> 02:59:44.880 align:start position:0%
a rough outline put into the law about
 
02:59:46.910 --> 02:59:46.920 align:start position:0%
it I think there's some Merit to it the
 
02:59:48.410 --> 02:59:48.420 align:start position:0%
housing Champion's obviously an opt-in
 
02:59:49.730 --> 02:59:49.740 align:start position:0%
program it's not a mandate on
 
02:59:49.740 --> 02:59:51.170 align:start position:0%
program it's not a mandate on
municipalities

02:59:51.170 --> 02:59:51.180 align:start position:0%
municipalities
 
02:59:52.610 --> 02:59:52.620 align:start position:0%
um so I would recommend first that you
 
02:59:54.110 --> 02:59:54.120 align:start position:0%
reach out to them and see kind of what
 
02:59:55.910 --> 02:59:55.920 align:start position:0%
their what the step is in their process
 
02:59:58.370 --> 02:59:58.380 align:start position:0%
and then if it's something that
 
03:00:00.170 --> 03:00:00.180 align:start position:0%
they can get done through the rulemaking
 
03:00:02.750 --> 03:00:02.760 align:start position:0%
process maybe we can as a committee help
 
03:00:03.830 --> 03:00:03.840 align:start position:0%
guide them
 
03:00:05.750 --> 03:00:05.760 align:start position:0%
on what our recommendations are for
 
03:00:05.760 --> 03:00:06.650 align:start position:0%
on what our recommendations are for
rules

03:00:06.650 --> 03:00:06.660 align:start position:0%
rules
 
03:00:08.150 --> 03:00:08.160 align:start position:0%
um or we can go straight into
 
03:00:09.590 --> 03:00:09.600 align:start position:0%
legislation but I don't know if that's
 
03:00:12.410 --> 03:00:12.420 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:16.130 --> 03:00:16.140 align:start position:0%
any thoughts about the um the like
 
03:00:19.010 --> 03:00:19.020 align:start position:0%
Statewide approval of plans of the
 
03:00:21.050 --> 03:00:21.060 align:start position:0%
direction that that would be good to go
 
03:00:28.630 --> 03:00:28.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:32.269 --> 03:00:32.279 align:start position:0%
for what I was talking about you know
 
03:00:34.190 --> 03:00:34.200 align:start position:0%
for the last I don't know three minutes
 
03:00:36.110 --> 03:00:36.120 align:start position:0%
where I was saying that that Seattle
 
03:00:40.670 --> 03:00:40.680 align:start position:0%
approved some Adu plans Citywide I I
 
03:00:43.730 --> 03:00:43.740 align:start position:0%
would like to see New Hampshire have a
 
03:00:47.389 --> 03:00:47.399 align:start position:0%
similar plan Statewide that may work for
 
03:00:50.450 --> 03:00:50.460 align:start position:0%
any type of plan whether that be a 3D
 
03:00:52.849 --> 03:00:52.859 align:start position:0%
printed plan or whatever if you have
 
03:00:56.090 --> 03:00:56.100 align:start position:0%
this plan you could go to a board at
 
03:00:59.269 --> 03:00:59.279 align:start position:0%
that the state designates and that if
 
03:01:01.370 --> 03:01:01.380 align:start position:0%
that plan was approved at that board you
 
03:01:02.809 --> 03:01:02.819 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have to go
 
03:01:05.870 --> 03:01:05.880 align:start position:0%
to the local every single time you want
 
03:01:09.050 --> 03:01:09.060 align:start position:0%
to print this 3D printed house that plan
 
03:01:11.269 --> 03:01:11.279 align:start position:0%
would already be approved and you would
 
03:01:12.889 --> 03:01:12.899 align:start position:0%
only be going to local municipalities
 
03:01:14.210 --> 03:01:14.220 align:start position:0%
for the
 
03:01:16.190 --> 03:01:16.200 align:start position:0%
the specific
 
03:01:16.200 --> 03:01:17.769 align:start position:0%
the specific
um uh

03:01:17.769 --> 03:01:17.779 align:start position:0%
um uh
 
03:01:20.630 --> 03:01:20.640 align:start position:0%
site work that needs to be done before
 
03:01:23.090 --> 03:01:23.100 align:start position:0%
they can build that house right with the
 
03:01:24.830 --> 03:01:24.840 align:start position:0%
foundation and the drainage and stuff
 
03:01:27.290 --> 03:01:27.300 align:start position:0%
like that but the actual building
 
03:01:29.870 --> 03:01:29.880 align:start position:0%
structure would already be approved and
 
03:01:33.650 --> 03:01:33.660 align:start position:0%
and at at uh a state level so that's
 
03:01:37.790 --> 03:01:37.800 align:start position:0%
kind of my idea and I am not exactly
 
03:01:40.969 --> 03:01:40.979 align:start position:0%
sure of the blueprint for that since
 
03:01:43.130 --> 03:01:43.140 align:start position:0%
Seattle didn't really do that they just
 
03:01:44.510 --> 03:01:44.520 align:start position:0%
said hey we're going to accept some
 
03:01:49.070 --> 03:01:49.080 align:start position:0%
plans and gr and do that so maybe
 
03:01:52.490 --> 03:01:52.500 align:start position:0%
um either the housing people or or the
 
03:01:55.190 --> 03:01:55.200 align:start position:0%
regional planning people might have an
 
03:01:58.370 --> 03:01:58.380 align:start position:0%
idea about how to move forward with kind
 
03:02:01.730 --> 03:02:01.740 align:start position:0%
of a regional adoption of specific plans
 
03:02:04.969 --> 03:02:04.979 align:start position:0%
that are submitted by by people for that
 
03:02:08.330 --> 03:02:08.340 align:start position:0%
purpose yeah I think a lot of us are in
 
03:02:09.769 --> 03:02:09.779 align:start position:0%
agreement on that I think maybe Ben
 
03:02:11.450 --> 03:02:11.460 align:start position:0%
would be a good person to at least talk
 
03:02:13.130 --> 03:02:13.140 align:start position:0%
to about that verse but would it not
 
03:02:16.190 --> 03:02:16.200 align:start position:0%
make sense to have the uh
 
03:02:18.410 --> 03:02:18.420 align:start position:0%
yeah would it not make sense to have the
 
03:02:20.030 --> 03:02:20.040 align:start position:0%
building code associate enforcement
 
03:02:22.370 --> 03:02:22.380 align:start position:0%
Association where they have all the
 
03:02:24.469 --> 03:02:24.479 align:start position:0%
disciplines needed the engineers the
 
03:02:26.809 --> 03:02:26.819 align:start position:0%
electricians the plumbers
 
03:02:28.730 --> 03:02:28.740 align:start position:0%
um they could you know they understand
 
03:02:31.969 --> 03:02:31.979 align:start position:0%
all the uh you know the the engineering
 
03:02:34.010 --> 03:02:34.020 align:start position:0%
detail and they could say yes this is a
 
03:02:36.769 --> 03:02:36.779 align:start position:0%
viable idea and we bless this for for
 
03:02:38.830 --> 03:02:38.840 align:start position:0%
Statewide use
 
03:02:41.090 --> 03:02:41.100 align:start position:0%
they already have the authority to
 
03:02:43.070 --> 03:02:43.080 align:start position:0%
handle disputes in those areas so that
 
03:02:46.490 --> 03:02:46.500 align:start position:0%
might be a smart resource
 
03:02:50.030 --> 03:02:50.040 align:start position:0%
representative boss and representative
 
03:02:51.950 --> 03:02:51.960 align:start position:0%
I shouldn't do this so I'm just inviting
 
03:02:54.710 --> 03:02:54.720 align:start position:0%
myself for a Marblehead movement moment
 
03:02:54.720 --> 03:02:55.370 align:start position:0%
myself for a Marblehead movement moment
um

03:02:55.370 --> 03:02:55.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:02:57.950 --> 03:02:57.960 align:start position:0%
I guess I just don't understand this
 
03:03:01.130 --> 03:03:01.140 align:start position:0%
pre-approved house or model
 
03:03:04.309 --> 03:03:04.319 align:start position:0%
because even land use boards planning
 
03:03:05.809 --> 03:03:05.819 align:start position:0%
zoning they deal with actual the
 
03:03:07.610 --> 03:03:07.620 align:start position:0%
subdivisions the place you put the house
 
03:03:09.950 --> 03:03:09.960 align:start position:0%
they're not even required in most cases
 
03:03:11.990 --> 03:03:12.000 align:start position:0%
to even see where the house is going to
 
03:03:13.910 --> 03:03:13.920 align:start position:0%
go short of the fact that you've got a
 
03:03:15.710 --> 03:03:15.720 align:start position:0%
buildable spot outside of your radius
 
03:03:19.190 --> 03:03:19.200 align:start position:0%
for both well and septic so I and even
 
03:03:22.490 --> 03:03:22.500 align:start position:0%
if you had models I guess that were by
 
03:03:24.050 --> 03:03:24.060 align:start position:0%
approved and again I still don't
 
03:03:25.849 --> 03:03:25.859 align:start position:0%
understand this there's no re I haven't
 
03:03:28.190 --> 03:03:28.200 align:start position:0%
seen requirements for what you want to
 
03:03:30.230 --> 03:03:30.240 align:start position:0%
build on a house they would still
 
03:03:32.269 --> 03:03:32.279 align:start position:0%
probably need to be inspected by
 
03:03:34.130 --> 03:03:34.140 align:start position:0%
somebody regardless of whether or not it
 
03:03:36.590 --> 03:03:36.600 align:start position:0%
was an approved plan so I just don't
 
03:03:38.570 --> 03:03:38.580 align:start position:0%
understand I'm missing something on this
 
03:03:40.550 --> 03:03:40.560 align:start position:0%
whole conversation
 
03:03:42.830 --> 03:03:42.840 align:start position:0%
representative Rudy thank you Mr
 
03:03:44.690 --> 03:03:44.700 align:start position:0%
chairman I think
 
03:03:46.849 --> 03:03:46.859 align:start position:0%
for many years I've been a modular home
 
03:03:50.170 --> 03:03:50.180 align:start position:0%
dealer we have those plans all approved
 
03:03:53.090 --> 03:03:53.100 align:start position:0%
I've bought homes from Canada from
 
03:03:55.730 --> 03:03:55.740 align:start position:0%
Pennsylvania from other places these
 
03:03:57.950 --> 03:03:57.960 align:start position:0%
homes are all approved they've got a
 
03:03:59.750 --> 03:03:59.760 align:start position:0%
third party inspector that comes in and
 
03:04:01.730 --> 03:04:01.740 align:start position:0%
inspects the wiring the plumbing
 
03:04:04.969 --> 03:04:04.979 align:start position:0%
everything so if a plan is approved by a
 
03:04:07.670 --> 03:04:07.680 align:start position:0%
third party they're acceptable and I
 
03:04:09.650 --> 03:04:09.660 align:start position:0%
believe every city and town in the state
 
03:04:12.590 --> 03:04:12.600 align:start position:0%
So the plan itself is the house itself
 
03:04:15.410 --> 03:04:15.420 align:start position:0%
is approved so I'm not sure what you
 
03:04:18.290 --> 03:04:18.300 align:start position:0%
want to add on to that
 
03:04:20.990 --> 03:04:21.000 align:start position:0%
okay representative yokella and then
 
03:04:23.150 --> 03:04:23.160 align:start position:0%
I'll go over a second so what you're
 
03:04:26.450 --> 03:04:26.460 align:start position:0%
talking about is a federal plan of
 
03:04:28.370 --> 03:04:28.380 align:start position:0%
approval they were approved at a federal
 
03:04:31.730 --> 03:04:31.740 align:start position:0%
level I'm saying not things that are not
 
03:04:35.030 --> 03:04:35.040 align:start position:0%
HUD approved plans like not federally
 
03:04:37.309 --> 03:04:37.319 align:start position:0%
approved it would be state approved it
 
03:04:39.290 --> 03:04:39.300 align:start position:0%
would have a different level of approval
 
03:04:41.929 --> 03:04:41.939 align:start position:0%
right so you could be HUD compliant or
 
03:04:43.010 --> 03:04:43.020 align:start position:0%
you could be just New Hampshire
 
03:04:45.830 --> 03:04:45.840 align:start position:0%
compliant right no what
 
03:04:47.570 --> 03:04:47.580 align:start position:0%
if I'm going to build a house I'm going
 
03:04:49.370 --> 03:04:49.380 align:start position:0%
to build a house in Rochester another
 
03:04:51.590 --> 03:04:51.600 align:start position:0%
one over and Dover and another one in
 
03:04:55.370 --> 03:04:55.380 align:start position:0%
Concord every town has certain maybe
 
03:04:58.550 --> 03:04:58.560 align:start position:0%
difference of approval levels or
 
03:05:01.130 --> 03:05:01.140 align:start position:0%
whatever that they need
 
03:05:04.010 --> 03:05:04.020 align:start position:0%
this third party researches everything
 
03:05:06.830 --> 03:05:06.840 align:start position:0%
that your town requires
 
03:05:08.450 --> 03:05:08.460 align:start position:0%
and they approve it
 
03:05:11.150 --> 03:05:11.160 align:start position:0%
and it's built to the approval it's
 
03:05:12.830 --> 03:05:12.840 align:start position:0%
built to the requirements of every
 
03:05:14.630 --> 03:05:14.640 align:start position:0%
different city in town
 
03:05:17.750 --> 03:05:17.760 align:start position:0%
so they won't even build it unless it
 
03:05:19.790 --> 03:05:19.800 align:start position:0%
meets all the requirements and it's
 
03:05:19.800 --> 03:05:21.290 align:start position:0%
meets all the requirements and it's
inspected

03:05:21.290 --> 03:05:21.300 align:start position:0%
inspected
 
03:05:25.790 --> 03:05:25.800 align:start position:0%
with all those requirements in place
 
03:05:28.370 --> 03:05:28.380 align:start position:0%
representative Reed
 
03:05:30.950 --> 03:05:30.960 align:start position:0%
and I think I'm maybe asking for
 
03:05:32.210 --> 03:05:32.220 align:start position:0%
clarification from representative
 
03:05:36.650 --> 03:05:36.660 align:start position:0%
viokala but is not the point then to say
 
03:05:39.769 --> 03:05:39.779 align:start position:0%
because some of the municipalities have
 
03:05:41.389 --> 03:05:41.399 align:start position:0%
been overly restrictive on anything
 
03:05:43.730 --> 03:05:43.740 align:start position:0%
that's like non-conventional for example
 
03:05:46.730 --> 03:05:46.740 align:start position:0%
3D printed homes Quonset homes which
 
03:05:48.530 --> 03:05:48.540 align:start position:0%
have really become quite the thing and
 
03:05:50.389 --> 03:05:50.399 align:start position:0%
there's like five million dollar Quonset
 
03:05:52.849 --> 03:05:52.859 align:start position:0%
Mansions now whereas quonsets used to be
 
03:05:56.450 --> 03:05:56.460 align:start position:0%
considered Huts so quonsets are these
 
03:05:59.450 --> 03:05:59.460 align:start position:0%
um domed arched metal structures they're
 
03:06:02.809 --> 03:06:02.819 align:start position:0%
what are built what's that World War II
 
03:06:04.550 --> 03:06:04.560 align:start position:0%
when you think of World War II Barracks
 
03:06:08.090 --> 03:06:08.100 align:start position:0%
that's the Army created quonsets to go
 
03:06:11.030 --> 03:06:11.040 align:start position:0%
up very quickly be very sturdy be very
 
03:06:13.070 --> 03:06:13.080 align:start position:0%
cheap and very efficient and they are so
 
03:06:14.690 --> 03:06:14.700 align:start position:0%
good that they come with a 50-year
 
03:06:16.910 --> 03:06:16.920 align:start position:0%
weather guarantee which is something you
 
03:06:18.950 --> 03:06:18.960 align:start position:0%
do not get with the stick build and they
 
03:06:20.990 --> 03:06:21.000 align:start position:0%
are the structure that is built in
 
03:06:24.530 --> 03:06:24.540 align:start position:0%
Antarctica to house the scientists so
 
03:06:26.630 --> 03:06:26.640 align:start position:0%
these are very high quality structures
 
03:06:28.969 --> 03:06:28.979 align:start position:0%
and yet towns will look look at them
 
03:06:30.950 --> 03:06:30.960 align:start position:0%
because they're different I will say the
 
03:06:32.510 --> 03:06:32.520 align:start position:0%
Whittemore Center one part of the
 
03:06:34.250 --> 03:06:34.260 align:start position:0%
Whittemore Center that many of us met in
 
03:06:37.730 --> 03:06:37.740 align:start position:0%
when we went to UNH during covid that is
 
03:06:40.910 --> 03:06:40.920 align:start position:0%
a Kwanzaa the Elks Lodge in Dover is the
 
03:06:42.530 --> 03:06:42.540 align:start position:0%
Kwanzaa so they're very very common and
 
03:06:45.469 --> 03:06:45.479 align:start position:0%
yet towns will Zone them out because
 
03:06:47.150 --> 03:06:47.160 align:start position:0%
they're non-conventional and so getting
 
03:06:49.309 --> 03:06:49.319 align:start position:0%
back to the point uh representative
 
03:06:51.650 --> 03:06:51.660 align:start position:0%
yokella isn't the point then to say to
 
03:06:54.469 --> 03:06:54.479 align:start position:0%
have a Statewide approval mechanism for
 
03:06:57.349 --> 03:06:57.359 align:start position:0%
these structures by which the state has
 
03:06:59.090 --> 03:06:59.100 align:start position:0%
said this structure is fine and
 
03:07:02.090 --> 03:07:02.100 align:start position:0%
therefore the municipalities can't say
 
03:07:04.130 --> 03:07:04.140 align:start position:0%
no to that particular they can do all
 
03:07:06.230 --> 03:07:06.240 align:start position:0%
the site stuff and everything and the
 
03:07:08.630 --> 03:07:08.640 align:start position:0%
inspections to make sure it meets what
 
03:07:11.090 --> 03:07:11.100 align:start position:0%
it claims to me but then they can't say
 
03:07:12.710 --> 03:07:12.720 align:start position:0%
no just because something is
 
03:07:12.720 --> 03:07:18.410 align:start position:0%
no just because something is
non-traditional

03:07:18.410 --> 03:07:18.420 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:23.630 --> 03:07:23.640 align:start position:0%
I wasn't I my goal was not to be so
 
03:07:26.870 --> 03:07:26.880 align:start position:0%
limiting to only
 
03:07:30.230 --> 03:07:30.240 align:start position:0%
Innovative techniques but
 
03:07:35.410 --> 03:07:35.420 align:start position:0%
yes if something is let's say
 
03:07:40.429 --> 03:07:40.439 align:start position:0%
unconventional and the person is
 
03:07:43.429 --> 03:07:43.439 align:start position:0%
building you know 10 of these homes and
 
03:07:45.910 --> 03:07:45.920 align:start position:0%
they don't want to have to
 
03:07:50.090 --> 03:07:50.100 align:start position:0%
go and explain the science of why this
 
03:07:52.910 --> 03:07:52.920 align:start position:0%
works 10 different times they just want
 
03:07:55.550 --> 03:07:55.560 align:start position:0%
to do it one time to a governing body
 
03:07:58.910 --> 03:07:58.920 align:start position:0%
that oversees and can understand and
 
03:08:03.349 --> 03:08:03.359 align:start position:0%
doesn't have maybe that bias then they
 
03:08:05.809 --> 03:08:05.819 align:start position:0%
you know whether that be you know lack
 
03:08:08.990 --> 03:08:09.000 align:start position:0%
of knowledge about 3D printed or or the
 
03:08:12.050 --> 03:08:12.060 align:start position:0%
the type of structure that is being
 
03:08:12.060 --> 03:08:13.969 align:start position:0%
the type of structure that is being
discussed

03:08:13.969 --> 03:08:13.979 align:start position:0%
discussed
 
03:08:16.910 --> 03:08:16.920 align:start position:0%
um that it would be allowed
 
03:08:19.130 --> 03:08:19.140 align:start position:0%
yes I've seen them before
 
03:08:22.490 --> 03:08:22.500 align:start position:0%
um that they
 
03:08:25.610 --> 03:08:25.620 align:start position:0%
that they would be allowed and without
 
03:08:28.610 --> 03:08:28.620 align:start position:0%
jumping through additional hurdles of
 
03:08:31.730 --> 03:08:31.740 align:start position:0%
you know oh we want the you know the we
 
03:08:34.070 --> 03:08:34.080 align:start position:0%
don't we want to expose brick
 
03:08:37.190 --> 03:08:37.200 align:start position:0%
in our you know our local regulations
 
03:08:39.650 --> 03:08:39.660 align:start position:0%
doesn't allow us exposed you know cement
 
03:08:43.370 --> 03:08:43.380 align:start position:0%
to be the the you know whatever the
 
03:08:46.250 --> 03:08:46.260 align:start position:0%
facade of the building or whatever that
 
03:08:50.750 --> 03:08:50.760 align:start position:0%
kind of stuff would not be allowed to be
 
03:08:52.610 --> 03:08:52.620 align:start position:0%
um you know
 
03:08:55.070 --> 03:08:55.080 align:start position:0%
as as the representative says like oh
 
03:08:57.050 --> 03:08:57.060 align:start position:0%
it's going to be designed every single
 
03:08:59.630 --> 03:08:59.640 align:start position:0%
time it's going to be changed
 
03:09:04.090 --> 03:09:04.100 align:start position:0%
um to meet those type of of uh
 
03:09:05.809 --> 03:09:05.819 align:start position:0%
restrictions in each different
 
03:09:07.849 --> 03:09:07.859 align:start position:0%
municipality if you have a structure
 
03:09:09.889 --> 03:09:09.899 align:start position:0%
that makes sense
 
03:09:11.990 --> 03:09:12.000 align:start position:0%
um then you can just produce that
 
03:09:14.510 --> 03:09:14.520 align:start position:0%
structure okay so with the goal of
 
03:09:15.590 --> 03:09:15.600 align:start position:0%
wrapping up I'm going to call and
 
03:09:17.630 --> 03:09:17.640 align:start position:0%
represent Walsh
 
03:09:20.269 --> 03:09:20.279 align:start position:0%
yeah now I understand what the goal is
 
03:09:22.389 --> 03:09:22.399 align:start position:0%
and that's to have these atypical
 
03:09:25.070 --> 03:09:25.080 align:start position:0%
mass-produced houses that by right in
 
03:09:26.210 --> 03:09:26.220 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire you can put
 
03:09:28.670 --> 03:09:28.680 align:start position:0%
them anywhere you want so I can't wait
 
03:09:30.830 --> 03:09:30.840 align:start position:0%
to see if the the burnt out a lot in the
 
03:09:33.110 --> 03:09:33.120 align:start position:0%
middle of Hooksett Village uh with the
 
03:09:35.870 --> 03:09:35.880 align:start position:0%
the ornate victorians on both sides and
 
03:09:37.610 --> 03:09:37.620 align:start position:0%
uh let's go plump one of these things in
 
03:09:39.469 --> 03:09:39.479 align:start position:0%
there that's going to go over well now I
 
03:09:41.889 --> 03:09:41.899 align:start position:0%
I understand now thank you
 
03:09:46.030 --> 03:09:46.040 align:start position:0%
okay all right
 
03:09:48.050 --> 03:09:48.060 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Walsh for being
 
03:09:50.210 --> 03:09:50.220 align:start position:0%
on this committee I appreciate it
 
03:09:52.370 --> 03:09:52.380 align:start position:0%
um is there any other business or can we
 
03:09:54.950 --> 03:09:54.960 align:start position:0%
break um I looking good
 
03:09:56.929 --> 03:09:56.939 align:start position:0%
I think I think the assignments I'm
 
03:09:58.730 --> 03:09:58.740 align:start position:0%
gonna have represented what I I want to
 
03:10:00.349 --> 03:10:00.359 align:start position:0%
meet next week how does everybody feel
 
03:10:03.950 --> 03:10:03.960 align:start position:0%
about that all right okay
 
03:10:06.590 --> 03:10:06.600 align:start position:0%
yeah do it all right so we're gonna meet
 
03:10:09.349 --> 03:10:09.359 align:start position:0%
next Tuesday I'm gonna expect some
 
03:10:11.210 --> 03:10:11.220 align:start position:0%
language from representative
 
03:10:12.950 --> 03:10:12.960 align:start position:0%
