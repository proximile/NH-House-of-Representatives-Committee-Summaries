for primary
 
00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:43.880 align:start position:0%
caregivers um so in the past we have had
 
00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:47.200 align:start position:0%
smaller subcommittees for inim study
 
00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 align:start position:0%
bills and those smaller subcommittees of
 
00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:51.880 align:start position:0%
course discuss it make their
 
00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:53.360 align:start position:0%
recommendations and come back and we
 
00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:56.680 align:start position:0%
vote on it as an entire committee and
 
00:01:59.429 --> 00:01:59.439 align:start position:0%
after discussing with uh chairman Roy he
 
00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:01.479 align:start position:0%
decided that you know he feels that
 
00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:02.840 align:start position:0%
we've pretty much already had the
 
00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 align:start position:0%
discussions and they just kind of come
 
00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 align:start position:0%
back go over them you know rather
 
00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 align:start position:0%
quickly as a committee and what I'm
 
00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 align:start position:0%
going to do is open each one we'll talk
 
00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:15.440 align:start position:0%
about it I'll close it we'll go to the
 
00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 align:start position:0%
next one and then we can break out we
 
00:02:18.869 --> 00:02:18.879 align:start position:0%
can go to our respective caucuses and
 
00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 align:start position:0%
we'll come back and make the
 
00:02:22.589 --> 00:02:22.599 align:start position:0%
recommendations from there so with that
 
00:02:25.869 --> 00:02:25.879 align:start position:0%
being said um house B 1039 relative to
 
00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 align:start position:0%
Alternative sentences for caregivers I
 
00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040 align:start position:0%
am opening it up for any discussion
 
00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 align:start position:0%
representative Murray good morning good
 
00:02:35.869 --> 00:02:35.879 align:start position:0%
morning thank you Vice chair roads um I
 
00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.280 align:start position:0%
was just going to share that um I am in
 
00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 align:start position:0%
conversation with the Coalition against
 
00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 align:start position:0%
sexual and domestic violence over this
 
00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 align:start position:0%
topic right now um because they named
 
00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 align:start position:0%
some concerns if we were to um to
 
00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 align:start position:0%
implement this bill with our current
 
00:02:52.149 --> 00:02:52.159 align:start position:0%
system as it is so I want to work with
 
00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 align:start position:0%
them to address those concerns before we
 
00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560 align:start position:0%
introduce legislation like this again so
 
00:02:58.309 --> 00:02:58.319 align:start position:0%
I would say we we not recommend it
 
00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:02.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:06.149 align:start position:0%
 
anybody

00:03:06.149 --> 00:03:06.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:09.149 --> 00:03:09.159 align:start position:0%
else representative Reed thank you
 
00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:11.920 align:start position:0%
chairman uh Alexander what were your
 
00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:14.120 align:start position:0%
questions your concerns regarding bring
 
00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:16.000 align:start position:0%
your mic down what were your concerns
 
00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:18.640 align:start position:0%
regarding this this bill that you feel
 
00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:20.440 align:start position:0%
need to be worked
 
00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:23.200 align:start position:0%
on from my understanding um the
 
00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:25.080 align:start position:0%
Coalition doesn't think that we have the
 
00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 align:start position:0%
support systems in place to make
 
00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 align:start position:0%
alternative sentencing a viable option
 
00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:31.040 align:start position:0%
at this point and that we need to build
 
00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:34.680 align:start position:0%
out our basically our systems of support
 
00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:37.000 align:start position:0%
before we can um Implement something
 
00:03:38.229 --> 00:03:38.239 align:start position:0%
that's going to bring more people into
 
00:03:39.589 --> 00:03:39.599 align:start position:0%
the community without the support
 
00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:42.239 align:start position:0%
systems necessary um yeah to make that
 
00:03:44.589 --> 00:03:44.599 align:start position:0%
safe for
 
00:03:46.869 --> 00:03:46.879 align:start position:0%
everybody representative Newman yeah I
 
00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:48.920 align:start position:0%
just want what what Coalition did did
 
00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:52.040 align:start position:0%
you say it was that you uh dealt with
 
00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:53.480 align:start position:0%
sorry Coalition against sexual and
 
00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:01.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:03.910 align:start position:0%
 
anybody

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:03.920 align:start position:0%
anybody
 
00:04:07.589 --> 00:04:07.599 align:start position:0%
else all right well seeing none I will
 
00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:10.400 align:start position:0%
close the work session for House Bill
 
00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:13.720 align:start position:0%
1039 and I will open
 
00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:18.400 align:start position:0%
the work session for House Bill 1428
 
00:04:21.629 --> 00:04:21.639 align:start position:0%
relative to inmate illness or emergency
 
00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:23.560 align:start position:0%
and again I will open it up to any
 
00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:27.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:31.629 --> 00:04:31.639 align:start position:0%
thoughts okay uh does anybody yeah
 
00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:34.880 align:start position:0%
representative scitec this is this is
 
00:04:37.749 --> 00:04:37.759 align:start position:0%
actually back before but I just wonder
 
00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:40.960 align:start position:0%
about whether we want to recommend this
 
00:04:47.469 --> 00:04:47.479 align:start position:0%
legislation or the topic for um further
 
00:04:52.469 --> 00:04:52.479 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:55.440 align:start position:0%
charge so if it's specifically about
 
00:04:58.270 --> 00:04:58.280 align:start position:0%
this legislation sure but that doesn't
 
00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:01.240 align:start position:0%
mean the topic isn't worth pursuing is I
 
00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:04.720 align:start position:0%
guess my point so if representative
 
00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:07.440 align:start position:0%
scitec you know obviously if you know
 
00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:10.360 align:start position:0%
our our job if I'm answering your your
 
00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:12.720 align:start position:0%
question specifically is to basically
 
00:05:16.469 --> 00:05:16.479 align:start position:0%
because we in inm studied the bill is
 
00:05:19.189 --> 00:05:19.199 align:start position:0%
does the committee as a whole feel that
 
00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:22.120 align:start position:0%
this that this particular bill is worthy
 
00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:25.120 align:start position:0%
of legislation in that event then
 
00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:28.120 align:start position:0%
somebody would be charged with writing
 
00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:30.160 align:start position:0%
the legislation and reintroducing ing it
 
00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:32.560 align:start position:0%
whenever we all come back in January you
 
00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:34.280 align:start position:0%
know those that are fortunate enough to
 
00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:36.560 align:start position:0%
come back or unfortunate enough I'm not
 
00:05:40.029 --> 00:05:40.039 align:start position:0%
really sure um uh you know but basically
 
00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:42.400 align:start position:0%
really today what we have to find out is
 
00:05:43.909 --> 00:05:43.919 align:start position:0%
do we think that this is should be
 
00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:46.680 align:start position:0%
recommended or not recommended and
 
00:05:48.309 --> 00:05:48.319 align:start position:0%
that's it we don't do anything else with
 
00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:50.680 align:start position:0%
it and if the person does want it to be
 
00:05:51.909 --> 00:05:51.919 align:start position:0%
you know come back then they're going to
 
00:05:53.749 --> 00:05:53.759 align:start position:0%
be the ones charged with doing that
 
00:05:57.510 --> 00:05:57.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:00.520 align:start position:0%
okay so does any does any anybody
 
00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:05.160 align:start position:0%
even recall what this was
 
00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:07.800 align:start position:0%
repres representative cig thank you very
 
00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:10.440 align:start position:0%
much mam chair um my recollection is
 
00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:11.960 align:start position:0%
that this was a bill that we had a lot
 
00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:14.400 align:start position:0%
of opposition to and a lot of discussion
 
00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:18.120 align:start position:0%
around how safely to transport prisoners
 
00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:20.280 align:start position:0%
to medical facilities without putting
 
00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:21.189 align:start position:0%
to medical facilities without putting
further

00:06:21.189 --> 00:06:21.199 align:start position:0%
further
 
00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:24.400 align:start position:0%
strains on departments uh Sheriff's
 
00:06:27.469 --> 00:06:27.479 align:start position:0%
departments among other things um I I
 
00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:28.960 align:start position:0%
couldn't find my notes when I was
 
00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:31.680 align:start position:0%
digging through my piles at home but um
 
00:06:33.189 --> 00:06:33.199 align:start position:0%
I just had this Rec my recollection is
 
00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:36.280 align:start position:0%
that the sheriff's Association was not
 
00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:38.080 align:start position:0%
necessarily in favor of this one because
 
00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:41.240 align:start position:0%
there were so many complexities to
 
00:06:45.390 --> 00:06:45.400 align:start position:0%
trying to make it work but I may be
 
00:06:48.909 --> 00:06:48.919 align:start position:0%
wrong representative Stone thank you
 
00:06:51.749 --> 00:06:51.759 align:start position:0%
madam chair uh it's my understanding
 
00:06:54.589 --> 00:06:54.599 align:start position:0%
that this bill was brought to basically
 
00:06:56.150 --> 00:06:56.160 align:start position:0%
give the authority of transporting
 
00:06:58.230 --> 00:06:58.240 align:start position:0%
prisoners that are already incarcerated
 
00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:00.240 align:start position:0%
to medical appointments by Correctional
 
00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:01.720 align:start position:0%
staff which if the committee is not
 
00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:03.360 align:start position:0%
aware most of the Cy Correctional
 
00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:05.160 align:start position:0%
Facilities have transport teams that are
 
00:07:07.469 --> 00:07:07.479 align:start position:0%
armed and trained to do such I think the
 
00:07:08.670 --> 00:07:08.680 align:start position:0%
sheriff's department was looking at it
 
00:07:10.390 --> 00:07:10.400 align:start position:0%
as it was a drain on some of their
 
00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:12.440 align:start position:0%
smaller departments size-wise and that
 
00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:14.080 align:start position:0%
the correctional staff might be better
 
00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:16.000 align:start position:0%
attuned to doing it than the sheriffs in
 
00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:18.240 align:start position:0%
various counties but I could be wrong if
 
00:07:19.629 --> 00:07:19.639 align:start position:0%
somebody has a better recollection I
 
00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:21.960 align:start position:0%
think that was the purpose of this bill
 
00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:25.560 align:start position:0%
if I see you give me one second so this
 
00:07:26.710 --> 00:07:26.720 align:start position:0%
is starting to come back to me a little
 
00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:29.000 align:start position:0%
bit as well wasn't there conversation
 
00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:30.230 align:start position:0%
bit as well wasn't there conversation
about

00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:30.240 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:07:32.350 --> 00:07:32.360 align:start position:0%
some of the smaller towns that may only
 
00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:36.120 align:start position:0%
have honestly one or two police officers
 
00:07:39.550 --> 00:07:39.560 align:start position:0%
and was this is when uh individual is
 
00:07:41.350 --> 00:07:41.360 align:start position:0%
incarcerated and they have a medical
 
00:07:43.270 --> 00:07:43.280 align:start position:0%
issue that the correctional staff have
 
00:07:45.629 --> 00:07:45.639 align:start position:0%
the capability currently I believe all
 
00:07:47.189 --> 00:07:47.199 align:start position:0%
10 but uh if someone has more
 
00:07:48.749 --> 00:07:48.759 align:start position:0%
information I know locally Sullivan
 
00:07:50.830 --> 00:07:50.840 align:start position:0%
County has a transport team that's armed
 
00:07:52.350 --> 00:07:52.360 align:start position:0%
to do their armed transports for
 
00:07:54.510 --> 00:07:54.520 align:start position:0%
prisoners and they have a dispute over
 
00:07:55.830 --> 00:07:55.840 align:start position:0%
should the sheriff's be responsible for
 
00:07:57.189 --> 00:07:57.199 align:start position:0%
doing all the transports or should it be
 
00:07:58.950 --> 00:07:58.960 align:start position:0%
the correctional staff Who currently do
 
00:08:00.710 --> 00:08:00.720 align:start position:0%
it with Federal detainees when they do
 
00:08:01.749 --> 00:08:01.759 align:start position:0%
have Federal detainees because the
 
00:08:03.189 --> 00:08:03.199 align:start position:0%
sheriff's departments generally will not
 
00:08:05.149 --> 00:08:05.159 align:start position:0%
transport Federal detainees that are on
 
00:08:07.749 --> 00:08:07.759 align:start position:0%
a per DM rate at a County
 
00:08:09.710 --> 00:08:09.720 align:start position:0%
facility I see that now thank you for
 
00:08:12.270 --> 00:08:12.280 align:start position:0%
the clarification representative Murray
 
00:08:14.990 --> 00:08:15.000 align:start position:0%
um I I pulled up the notes we have from
 
00:08:17.309 --> 00:08:17.319 align:start position:0%
the hearing and this was actually only a
 
00:08:18.629 --> 00:08:18.639 align:start position:0%
minute or two long hearing where the
 
00:08:20.270 --> 00:08:20.280 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor came out and asked that we
 
00:08:21.670 --> 00:08:21.680 align:start position:0%
hold it for interm study because the
 
00:08:25.350 --> 00:08:25.360 align:start position:0%
bill needed more work um so I it sounds
 
00:08:28.070 --> 00:08:28.080 align:start position:0%
like yeah that's literally one sentence
 
00:08:31.270 --> 00:08:31.280 align:start position:0%
that's why having the clerk is good
 
00:08:32.790 --> 00:08:32.800 align:start position:0%
so it was the Prime sponsor that asked
 
00:08:34.350 --> 00:08:34.360 align:start position:0%
the stum study it because he didn't like
 
00:08:37.670 --> 00:08:37.680 align:start position:0%
the way it was written basically okay
 
00:08:40.149 --> 00:08:40.159 align:start position:0%
all right anybody
 
00:08:43.110 --> 00:08:43.120 align:start position:0%
else all right well with that we will
 
00:08:45.110 --> 00:08:45.120 align:start position:0%
close the work session for House Bill
 
00:08:45.120 --> 00:09:02.470 align:start position:0%
close the work session for House Bill
1428

00:09:02.470 --> 00:09:02.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:04.750 --> 00:09:04.760 align:start position:0%
okay so we will open the work session
 
00:09:08.069 --> 00:09:08.079 align:start position:0%
for House Bill 1462 relative to
 
00:09:10.710 --> 00:09:10.720 align:start position:0%
requirements reporting hate crimes and
 
00:09:13.069 --> 00:09:13.079 align:start position:0%
representative Murray you'd like to
 
00:09:15.870 --> 00:09:15.880 align:start position:0%
talk yes so originally the chairman and
 
00:09:18.910 --> 00:09:18.920 align:start position:0%
I held this um in case we needed to use
 
00:09:22.150 --> 00:09:22.160 align:start position:0%
it but um Senator Chanley passed a
 
00:09:25.190 --> 00:09:25.200 align:start position:0%
similar Bill essentially um when I
 
00:09:27.670 --> 00:09:27.680 align:start position:0%
drafted this one the AG didn't have the
 
00:09:30.150 --> 00:09:30.160 align:start position:0%
full information that we then got later
 
00:09:32.389 --> 00:09:32.399 align:start position:0%
amended Senator chand's Bill and passed
 
00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:34.000 align:start position:0%
the legislation that way so this bill
 
00:09:37.190 --> 00:09:37.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:40.590 --> 00:09:40.600 align:start position:0%
point so so when we're ready to go
 
00:09:42.470 --> 00:09:42.480 align:start position:0%
you're basically recommending not you're
 
00:09:45.190 --> 00:09:45.200 align:start position:0%
just recommending no future legislation
 
00:09:51.310 --> 00:09:51.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:53.910 --> 00:09:53.920 align:start position:0%
note anybody else we
 
00:09:57.030 --> 00:09:57.040 align:start position:0%
good all right well we will close the
 
00:10:06.230 --> 00:10:06.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:08.710 --> 00:10:08.720 align:start position:0%
okay we will open the work session for
 
00:10:11.630 --> 00:10:11.640 align:start position:0%
House Bill 1500 relative to prohibiting
 
00:10:13.550 --> 00:10:13.560 align:start position:0%
the unlawful distri distribution of
 
00:10:15.630 --> 00:10:15.640 align:start position:0%
misleading synthetic
 
00:10:17.630 --> 00:10:17.640 align:start position:0%
media and I
 
00:10:23.509 --> 00:10:23.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:25.430 --> 00:10:25.440 align:start position:0%
discussions representative Murray what
 
00:10:27.470 --> 00:10:27.480 align:start position:0%
do your notes
 
00:10:30.470 --> 00:10:30.480 align:start position:0%
say Madam chair I I
 
00:10:31.870 --> 00:10:31.880 align:start position:0%
oh I was just trying to raise my hand I
 
00:10:33.990 --> 00:10:34.000 align:start position:0%
I was the uh co-sponsor of this
 
00:10:36.470 --> 00:10:36.480 align:start position:0%
legislation and we moved this interim
 
00:10:38.949 --> 00:10:38.959 align:start position:0%
study because the chair and many
 
00:10:41.230 --> 00:10:41.240 align:start position:0%
legislators felt that a commission
 
00:10:44.030 --> 00:10:44.040 align:start position:0%
around AI is how the legislature should
 
00:10:46.350 --> 00:10:46.360 align:start position:0%
move forward and whomever is elected
 
00:10:47.870 --> 00:10:47.880 align:start position:0%
speaker next year I would hope moves
 
00:10:50.509 --> 00:10:50.519 align:start position:0%
forward with that and a similar style
 
00:10:51.829 --> 00:10:51.839 align:start position:0%
Commission because the issue is
 
00:10:54.670 --> 00:10:54.680 align:start position:0%
important but how to get it done as
 
00:10:57.350 --> 00:10:57.360 align:start position:0%
where the opposition comes in from there
 
00:10:59.829 --> 00:10:59.839 align:start position:0%
was opposition from the media um I
 
00:11:02.269 --> 00:11:02.279 align:start position:0%
forget exactly what their Association
 
00:11:05.590 --> 00:11:05.600 align:start position:0%
the broadcasters Association and um they
 
00:11:07.030 --> 00:11:07.040 align:start position:0%
don't there's concerns around free
 
00:11:10.310 --> 00:11:10.320 align:start position:0%
speech and uh criminalizing satire and I
 
00:11:13.710 --> 00:11:13.720 align:start position:0%
think those are genuine concerns so I I
 
00:11:15.910 --> 00:11:15.920 align:start position:0%
think recommending no further
 
00:11:18.870 --> 00:11:18.880 align:start position:0%
legislation would be appropriate and uh
 
00:11:21.710 --> 00:11:21.720 align:start position:0%
pushing whoever gets elected speaker to
 
00:11:23.470 --> 00:11:23.480 align:start position:0%
appoint a commission along those lines I
 
00:11:25.550 --> 00:11:25.560 align:start position:0%
think would be better than trying to
 
00:11:27.629 --> 00:11:27.639 align:start position:0%
force through legislation thank you
 
00:11:29.710 --> 00:11:29.720 align:start position:0%
representative Willer I I will add to
 
00:11:32.949 --> 00:11:32.959 align:start position:0%
that that I do remember there
 
00:11:38.190 --> 00:11:38.200 align:start position:0%
was three or four if not more pieces of
 
00:11:40.350 --> 00:11:40.360 align:start position:0%
legislation that were in various
 
00:11:42.430 --> 00:11:42.440 align:start position:0%
committees not just ours I think we had
 
00:11:44.790 --> 00:11:44.800 align:start position:0%
two um
 
00:11:47.790 --> 00:11:47.800 align:start position:0%
additionally Judiciary also had a couple
 
00:11:49.990 --> 00:11:50.000 align:start position:0%
and I I feel like somebody else had one
 
00:11:51.350 --> 00:11:51.360 align:start position:0%
as well I'm not really sure God bless
 
00:11:54.310 --> 00:11:54.320 align:start position:0%
you whoever did that um and I do I'm
 
00:11:56.389 --> 00:11:56.399 align:start position:0%
recalling now
 
00:11:59.430 --> 00:11:59.440 align:start position:0%
that there was discussion I was was
 
00:12:00.430 --> 00:12:00.440 align:start position:0%
there there was a couple other
 
00:12:04.310 --> 00:12:04.320 align:start position:0%
representatives there um somebody there
 
00:12:06.949 --> 00:12:06.959 align:start position:0%
was a representative from election law I
 
00:12:08.750 --> 00:12:08.760 align:start position:0%
think I think it's representative
 
00:12:10.069 --> 00:12:10.079 align:start position:0%
Brennan but I don't want to say that if
 
00:12:11.150 --> 00:12:11.160 align:start position:0%
it wasn't true but I'm pretty sure it
 
00:12:13.069 --> 00:12:13.079 align:start position:0%
was her representative Lynn was there
 
00:12:15.430 --> 00:12:15.440 align:start position:0%
myself um and a couple of others the
 
00:12:16.750 --> 00:12:16.760 align:start position:0%
speaker was also there and we did
 
00:12:20.629 --> 00:12:20.639 align:start position:0%
discuss this and the question was about
 
00:12:22.470 --> 00:12:22.480 align:start position:0%
you know the difference between like
 
00:12:24.670 --> 00:12:24.680 align:start position:0%
you're saying satire
 
00:12:29.550 --> 00:12:29.560 align:start position:0%
or almost an actual threat and I I do
 
00:12:32.150 --> 00:12:32.160 align:start position:0%
believe that was the the thought process
 
00:12:33.470 --> 00:12:33.480 align:start position:0%
was to come back with something that was
 
00:12:34.949 --> 00:12:34.959 align:start position:0%
going to that was going to address all
 
00:12:37.949 --> 00:12:37.959 align:start position:0%
of it not not just kind of you know
 
00:12:39.750 --> 00:12:39.760 align:start position:0%
patch a couple of leaks that kind of was
 
00:12:41.269 --> 00:12:41.279 align:start position:0%
happening with the bail so this was kind
 
00:12:44.509 --> 00:12:44.519 align:start position:0%
of similar to that and I do believe we
 
00:12:46.910 --> 00:12:46.920 align:start position:0%
did pass something on the house floor
 
00:12:49.790 --> 00:12:49.800 align:start position:0%
about this already though so we probably
 
00:12:51.629 --> 00:12:51.639 align:start position:0%
don't need to keep on going with it I
 
00:12:52.710 --> 00:12:52.720 align:start position:0%
think you're right representative
 
00:12:55.269 --> 00:12:55.279 align:start position:0%
wheeler um hold on one second
 
00:12:56.389 --> 00:12:56.399 align:start position:0%
representative Newman did you have
 
00:12:57.790 --> 00:12:57.800 align:start position:0%
something you wanted to say or you just
 
00:13:00.110 --> 00:13:00.120 align:start position:0%
had your notes okay representative
 
00:13:03.110 --> 00:13:03.120 align:start position:0%
Newman yeah I just have a question about
 
00:13:06.389 --> 00:13:06.399 align:start position:0%
the process so this appears to be a bill
 
00:13:07.870 --> 00:13:07.880 align:start position:0%
that it that we probably wouldn't
 
00:13:09.949 --> 00:13:09.959 align:start position:0%
recommend for this bill to go forward
 
00:13:12.470 --> 00:13:12.480 align:start position:0%
but the subject matter appears to be
 
00:13:17.389 --> 00:13:17.399 align:start position:0%
worthy of a bill so we if we voted yes
 
00:13:21.310 --> 00:13:21.320 align:start position:0%
we would be voting can we vote Yes that
 
00:13:25.030 --> 00:13:25.040 align:start position:0%
the pro that it's worthy of of a bill
 
00:13:27.590 --> 00:13:27.600 align:start position:0%
and then somebody would just do a bill
 
00:13:30.189 --> 00:13:30.199 align:start position:0%
or would we have to do a bill
 
00:13:34.389 --> 00:13:34.399 align:start position:0%
so what we do today is we make a
 
00:13:36.829 --> 00:13:36.839 align:start position:0%
recommendation basically on on the bill
 
00:13:40.150 --> 00:13:40.160 align:start position:0%
that we have in front of us so even if
 
00:13:43.430 --> 00:13:43.440 align:start position:0%
we say that we don't particularly think
 
00:13:45.590 --> 00:13:45.600 align:start position:0%
that it should be recommended that
 
00:13:48.590 --> 00:13:48.600 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean that anybody regardless if
 
00:13:50.389 --> 00:13:50.399 align:start position:0%
they're in this committee or another
 
00:13:53.069 --> 00:13:53.079 align:start position:0%
committee can't say I actually think
 
00:13:55.509 --> 00:13:55.519 align:start position:0%
that there should be some legislation
 
00:13:58.269 --> 00:13:58.279 align:start position:0%
and and write that so I I don't think
 
00:13:59.670 --> 00:13:59.680 align:start position:0%
it's as simple as
 
00:14:01.629 --> 00:14:01.639 align:start position:0%
yes or no yes it is this particular bill
 
00:14:05.350 --> 00:14:05.360 align:start position:0%
but it also is a subject matter right um
 
00:14:07.069 --> 00:14:07.079 align:start position:0%
but as we all know you can you can write
 
00:14:09.189 --> 00:14:09.199 align:start position:0%
the bill for anything that you feel
 
00:14:11.310 --> 00:14:11.320 align:start position:0%
needs to be addressed and if it's this
 
00:14:13.269 --> 00:14:13.279 align:start position:0%
subject matter you're welcome to do that
 
00:14:15.150 --> 00:14:15.160 align:start position:0%
but today we're voting on this bill
 
00:14:16.350 --> 00:14:16.360 align:start position:0%
whether or not we think should be
 
00:14:18.189 --> 00:14:18.199 align:start position:0%
recommended to continue yes or no but
 
00:14:20.150 --> 00:14:20.160 align:start position:0%
yes or no on this Bill thank
 
00:14:22.110 --> 00:14:22.120 align:start position:0%
you well it's the third time it got
 
00:14:23.350 --> 00:14:23.360 align:start position:0%
asked so apparently there might be more
 
00:14:25.670 --> 00:14:25.680 align:start position:0%
than just yes or no uh representative
 
00:14:27.110 --> 00:14:27.120 align:start position:0%
scitech did you have a
 
00:14:30.389 --> 00:14:30.399 align:start position:0%
question okay all right anybody
 
00:14:32.550 --> 00:14:32.560 align:start position:0%
else all right well we will close the
 
00:14:37.470 --> 00:14:37.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:41.230 --> 00:14:41.240 align:start position:0%
1500 and we will open the work study um
 
00:14:43.269 --> 00:14:43.279 align:start position:0%
Jesus the work committee
 
00:14:45.749 --> 00:14:45.759 align:start position:0%
for oh wait hold on I have them my bills
 
00:14:47.749 --> 00:14:47.759 align:start position:0%

00:14:50.269 --> 00:14:50.279 align:start position:0%
order wait a second I got to get to
 
00:14:54.310 --> 00:14:54.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:58.829 --> 00:14:58.839 align:start position:0%
it all right so House Bill 1566 relative
 
00:15:01.470 --> 00:15:01.480 align:start position:0%
the review of police
 
00:15:03.910 --> 00:15:03.920 align:start position:0%
investigations okay so this was the bill
 
00:15:05.749 --> 00:15:05.759 align:start position:0%
I do remember specifically I'm sure that
 
00:15:07.910 --> 00:15:07.920 align:start position:0%
we all do
 
00:15:12.749 --> 00:15:12.759 align:start position:0%

00:15:12.759 --> 00:15:13.670 align:start position:0%
um unfortunately there there was um some
deaths

deaths
involved

00:15:16.350 --> 00:15:16.360 align:start position:0%
involved
 
00:15:19.069 --> 00:15:19.079 align:start position:0%
and the the family members were very
 
00:15:21.629 --> 00:15:21.639 align:start position:0%
very passionate that things were not
 
00:15:21.639 --> 00:15:23.150 align:start position:0%
very passionate that things were not
done

00:15:23.150 --> 00:15:23.160 align:start position:0%
done
 
00:15:27.230 --> 00:15:27.240 align:start position:0%
correctly and you know we heard from we
 
00:15:29.749 --> 00:15:29.759 align:start position:0%
heard from law enforcement we heard from
 
00:15:31.749 --> 00:15:31.759 align:start position:0%

00:15:35.949 --> 00:15:35.959 align:start position:0%
day that there's going to be any
 
00:15:39.949 --> 00:15:39.959 align:start position:0%
answer that is going to be sufficient
 
00:15:42.069 --> 00:15:42.079 align:start position:0%
for a family member grieving a child I I
 
00:15:46.030 --> 00:15:46.040 align:start position:0%
I just don't um I know I recommended
 
00:15:49.949 --> 00:15:49.959 align:start position:0%
that the bill be itl because we do have
 
00:15:52.629 --> 00:15:52.639 align:start position:0%
you know many there is a lot of
 
00:15:55.949 --> 00:15:55.959 align:start position:0%
processes that are in place um this
 
00:15:59.069 --> 00:15:59.079 align:start position:0%
particular situation did go through all
 
00:16:02.269 --> 00:16:02.279 align:start position:0%
of those channels and unfortunately the
 
00:16:04.430 --> 00:16:04.440 align:start position:0%
answer was just not ever going to be
 
00:16:07.710 --> 00:16:07.720 align:start position:0%
what what that family needed
 
00:16:10.150 --> 00:16:10.160 align:start position:0%
um I actually recommended that we inter
 
00:16:12.509 --> 00:16:12.519 align:start position:0%
terms studied it I'm sorry that we ited
 
00:16:14.110 --> 00:16:14.120 align:start position:0%
it and then it you know basically we
 
00:16:16.910 --> 00:16:16.920 align:start position:0%
just agreed to interim study at that day
 
00:16:19.110 --> 00:16:19.120 align:start position:0%
you know my recommendation would be that
 
00:16:21.629 --> 00:16:21.639 align:start position:0%
we do not recommend it for future
 
00:16:24.189 --> 00:16:24.199 align:start position:0%
legislation um but of course we're not
 
00:16:25.629 --> 00:16:25.639 align:start position:0%
making those this moment but
 
00:16:27.430 --> 00:16:27.440 align:start position:0%
representative wheeler
 
00:16:29.470 --> 00:16:29.480 align:start position:0%
Ching thank you madam CH I just wanted
 
00:16:32.269 --> 00:16:32.279 align:start position:0%
to add having worked with the family uh
 
00:16:35.230 --> 00:16:35.240 align:start position:0%
in helping them speak with the executive
 
00:16:37.829 --> 00:16:37.839 align:start position:0%
branch and meeting with the Attorney
 
00:16:41.269 --> 00:16:41.279 align:start position:0%
General's office and um going through
 
00:16:42.550 --> 00:16:42.560 align:start position:0%
this legislation with the governor's
 
00:16:43.749 --> 00:16:43.759 align:start position:0%
office and the attorneys General's
 
00:16:46.870 --> 00:16:46.880 align:start position:0%
office I I do believe that
 
00:16:50.550 --> 00:16:50.560 align:start position:0%
um this is an issue in legislation worth
 
00:16:53.509 --> 00:16:53.519 align:start position:0%
moving forward on um I think
 
00:16:57.870 --> 00:16:57.880 align:start position:0%
that the technical opposition that was
 
00:17:00.829 --> 00:17:00.839 align:start position:0%
offered for this legislation with all
 
00:17:03.710 --> 00:17:03.720 align:start position:0%
due respect to those who did I think was
 
00:17:07.470 --> 00:17:07.480 align:start position:0%
offered more because of how emotional
 
00:17:09.710 --> 00:17:09.720 align:start position:0%
the situation that particular situation
 
00:17:11.710 --> 00:17:11.720 align:start position:0%
was but the family made it clear that
 
00:17:13.750 --> 00:17:13.760 align:start position:0%
this wasn't about their situation this
 
00:17:17.309 --> 00:17:17.319 align:start position:0%
was about uh making sure that there was
 
00:17:21.630 --> 00:17:21.640 align:start position:0%
accountability and um I'll be voting
 
00:17:25.309 --> 00:17:25.319 align:start position:0%
against a motion to not recommend any
 
00:17:27.390 --> 00:17:27.400 align:start position:0%
further action on this legislation
 
00:17:29.310 --> 00:17:29.320 align:start position:0%
because of that and I I think that
 
00:17:31.590 --> 00:17:31.600 align:start position:0%
accountability is important and having
 
00:17:33.070 --> 00:17:33.080 align:start position:0%
worked with the governor's office and
 
00:17:36.390 --> 00:17:36.400 align:start position:0%
the AG on this uh I I would think that
 
00:17:37.710 --> 00:17:37.720 align:start position:0%
this legislation
 
00:17:40.710 --> 00:17:40.720 align:start position:0%
is fine to move
 
00:17:42.789 --> 00:17:42.799 align:start position:0%
forward representative
 
00:17:46.230 --> 00:17:46.240 align:start position:0%
Manion thank you um it's a difficult
 
00:17:48.750 --> 00:17:48.760 align:start position:0%
subject taking the emotion out of it
 
00:17:51.430 --> 00:17:51.440 align:start position:0%
this um is not about accountability was
 
00:17:52.549 --> 00:17:52.559 align:start position:0%
it was made clear that they didn't think
 
00:17:55.070 --> 00:17:55.080 align:start position:0%
the jry police department did anything
 
00:17:57.070 --> 00:17:57.080 align:start position:0%
uh that that resulted in misconduct they
 
00:17:59.070 --> 00:17:59.080 align:start position:0%
just didn't like the results of the
 
00:18:01.350 --> 00:18:01.360 align:start position:0%
accident reconstruction report it was
 
00:18:03.630 --> 00:18:03.640 align:start position:0%
reviewed by the county attorney and the
 
00:18:05.270 --> 00:18:05.280 align:start position:0%
Manchester Police Department also did
 
00:18:07.110 --> 00:18:07.120 align:start position:0%
their own independent reconstruction of
 
00:18:09.990 --> 00:18:10.000 align:start position:0%
it with the same findings so this is
 
00:18:11.510 --> 00:18:11.520 align:start position:0%
more about the findings that they
 
00:18:13.710 --> 00:18:13.720 align:start position:0%
weren't satisfied with um if there's any
 
00:18:15.789 --> 00:18:15.799 align:start position:0%
misconduct done in the police department
 
00:18:17.390 --> 00:18:17.400 align:start position:0%
the state police or the Attorney General
 
00:18:19.390 --> 00:18:19.400 align:start position:0%
are going to investigate that aw is not
 
00:18:21.470 --> 00:18:21.480 align:start position:0%
needed to do that this was simply about
 
00:18:23.149 --> 00:18:23.159 align:start position:0%
you didn't like the findings or you
 
00:18:24.270 --> 00:18:24.280 align:start position:0%
didn't agree with them so you want
 
00:18:26.990 --> 00:18:27.000 align:start position:0%
someone else to take a look at them um
 
00:18:28.350 --> 00:18:28.360 align:start position:0%
and this and in this case here they want
 
00:18:30.310 --> 00:18:30.320 align:start position:0%
the state police to look at it what if
 
00:18:32.149 --> 00:18:32.159 align:start position:0%
the police state police came back with
 
00:18:33.510 --> 00:18:33.520 align:start position:0%
the same
 
00:18:35.990 --> 00:18:36.000 align:start position:0%
findings we just ended there so this
 
00:18:38.549 --> 00:18:38.559 align:start position:0%
isn't really if I remember correctly not
 
00:18:40.990 --> 00:18:41.000 align:start position:0%
an accountabil ability bill but more
 
00:18:42.669 --> 00:18:42.679 align:start position:0%
about we didn't like uh what the
 
00:18:45.029 --> 00:18:45.039 align:start position:0%
findings were
 
00:18:47.230 --> 00:18:47.240 align:start position:0%
so representative
 
00:18:50.830 --> 00:18:50.840 align:start position:0%
n thank you madam chair um I think the
 
00:18:51.870 --> 00:18:51.880 align:start position:0%
conversation that we're having is
 
00:18:53.350 --> 00:18:53.360 align:start position:0%
talking about a specific issue but the
 
00:18:56.390 --> 00:18:56.400 align:start position:0%
point is to implement A system that
 
00:18:59.310 --> 00:18:59.320 align:start position:0%
enables people to have um to have an
 
00:19:01.590 --> 00:19:01.600 align:start position:0%
independent review I we talk about how
 
00:19:04.230 --> 00:19:04.240 align:start position:0%
the independent review or um a quasi
 
00:19:07.590 --> 00:19:07.600 align:start position:0%
independent review was done and that was
 
00:19:09.909 --> 00:19:09.919 align:start position:0%
a process that you know put the family
 
00:19:11.950 --> 00:19:11.960 align:start position:0%
in this specific situation through uh
 
00:19:13.789 --> 00:19:13.799 align:start position:0%
the process of having to fight for that
 
00:19:14.870 --> 00:19:14.880 align:start position:0%
whereas what we're saying is we're
 
00:19:16.270 --> 00:19:16.280 align:start position:0%
saying that should that should be
 
00:19:17.789 --> 00:19:17.799 align:start position:0%
automatic that should be something that
 
00:19:19.830 --> 00:19:19.840 align:start position:0%
if requested should be done so we're
 
00:19:21.549 --> 00:19:21.559 align:start position:0%
saying it was done and they weren't
 
00:19:22.630 --> 00:19:22.640 align:start position:0%
happy with the results well if they
 
00:19:24.470 --> 00:19:24.480 align:start position:0%
weren't happy with results that's that's
 
00:19:26.430 --> 00:19:26.440 align:start position:0%
not what we're legislating here we're
 
00:19:28.549 --> 00:19:28.559 align:start position:0%
legislating um the capacity for someone
 
00:19:29.750 --> 00:19:29.760 align:start position:0%
to to be able to have an independent
 
00:19:31.510 --> 00:19:31.520 align:start position:0%
review without having to fight for it so
 
00:19:35.549 --> 00:19:35.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:39.789 --> 00:19:39.799 align:start position:0%
com representative Murray on thank you
 
00:19:42.830 --> 00:19:42.840 align:start position:0%
madam chair um first I wanted to note
 
00:19:46.270 --> 00:19:46.280 align:start position:0%
that um when Manchester Chief of Police
 
00:19:49.230 --> 00:19:49.240 align:start position:0%
Alan aldenberg testified he talked about
 
00:19:52.789 --> 00:19:52.799 align:start position:0%
how um there is already a process for if
 
00:19:54.390 --> 00:19:54.400 align:start position:0%
a victim feels the local police
 
00:19:55.909 --> 00:19:55.919 align:start position:0%
department did not do an adequate
 
00:19:58.230 --> 00:19:58.240 align:start position:0%
investigation that they can go to the
 
00:20:00.390 --> 00:20:00.400 align:start position:0%
public Integrity unit at the AG year or
 
00:20:01.630 --> 00:20:01.640 align:start position:0%
go through the County Attorney as
 
00:20:04.270 --> 00:20:04.280 align:start position:0%
representative Manion mentioned um and
 
00:20:06.870 --> 00:20:06.880 align:start position:0%
there already are processes in place to
 
00:20:08.990 --> 00:20:09.000 align:start position:0%
have you know a further look into an
 
00:20:11.470 --> 00:20:11.480 align:start position:0%
issue like this um I guess
 
00:20:12.950 --> 00:20:12.960 align:start position:0%
representative wheeler wanted to hear
 
00:20:15.110 --> 00:20:15.120 align:start position:0%
more about these conversations that
 
00:20:16.590 --> 00:20:16.600 align:start position:0%
you've had with the AG and governor's
 
00:20:19.350 --> 00:20:19.360 align:start position:0%
office that make you feel like there is
 
00:20:24.270 --> 00:20:24.280 align:start position:0%
more room to to push here
 
00:20:26.470 --> 00:20:26.480 align:start position:0%
I hold on one second representative
 
00:20:29.110 --> 00:20:29.120 align:start position:0%
wheeler representative Roy had a comment
 
00:20:30.270 --> 00:20:30.280 align:start position:0%
and I had to call on representative
 
00:20:32.630 --> 00:20:32.640 align:start position:0%
Marie first that's okay you can go ahead
 
00:20:35.350 --> 00:20:35.360 align:start position:0%
and answer her that we keep
 
00:20:38.029 --> 00:20:38.039 align:start position:0%
continuity representative wheeler
 
00:20:40.950 --> 00:20:40.960 align:start position:0%
so Maryann scotus the woman who came to
 
00:20:44.190 --> 00:20:44.200 align:start position:0%
testify who had the
 
00:20:47.310 --> 00:20:47.320 align:start position:0%
specific issue that were that the bill
 
00:20:49.750 --> 00:20:49.760 align:start position:0%
was proposed around wanted to meet with
 
00:20:53.350 --> 00:20:53.360 align:start position:0%
the governor's office and I relayed that
 
00:20:55.350 --> 00:20:55.360 align:start position:0%
and helped meet helped her meet with the
 
00:20:56.789 --> 00:20:56.799 align:start position:0%
governor's office those conversations
 
00:21:00.549 --> 00:21:00.559 align:start position:0%
were around this bill and what they felt
 
00:21:02.950 --> 00:21:02.960 align:start position:0%
could potentially be wrong with the bill
 
00:21:05.270 --> 00:21:05.280 align:start position:0%
uh what the systems were implemented the
 
00:21:07.110 --> 00:21:07.120 align:start position:0%
AG wanted to know about this uh
 
00:21:09.990 --> 00:21:10.000 align:start position:0%
situation itself what particularly might
 
00:21:12.470 --> 00:21:12.480 align:start position:0%
have gone wrong there um I don't I don't
 
00:21:14.350 --> 00:21:14.360 align:start position:0%
know where those conversations went
 
00:21:16.950 --> 00:21:16.960 align:start position:0%
beyond me sitting down in the executive
 
00:21:19.269 --> 00:21:19.279 align:start position:0%
Council chamber with the representative
 
00:21:21.750 --> 00:21:21.760 align:start position:0%
from the AG's office and uh Harold
 
00:21:23.350 --> 00:21:23.360 align:start position:0%
Parker from the governor's office but I
 
00:21:24.830 --> 00:21:24.840 align:start position:0%
can say that both the governor's office
 
00:21:27.070 --> 00:21:27.080 align:start position:0%
and the attorneys General's office was
 
00:21:30.710 --> 00:21:30.720 align:start position:0%
very at least in that meeting open to
 
00:21:32.789 --> 00:21:32.799 align:start position:0%
hearing what this legislation was about
 
00:21:34.510 --> 00:21:34.520 align:start position:0%
open to what their situation was about
 
00:21:37.149 --> 00:21:37.159 align:start position:0%
and I think that the Family itself was a
 
00:21:40.350 --> 00:21:40.360 align:start position:0%
little upset just by uh being taken on a
 
00:21:42.350 --> 00:21:42.360 align:start position:0%
bit of a rigorer ro by the state
 
00:21:44.310 --> 00:21:44.320 align:start position:0%
government and I and I think that that
 
00:21:45.990 --> 00:21:46.000 align:start position:0%
happens to plenty of people not just
 
00:21:47.830 --> 00:21:47.840 align:start position:0%
this one particular family I think
 
00:21:51.950 --> 00:21:51.960 align:start position:0%
people in the state government are um uh
 
00:21:54.870 --> 00:21:54.880 align:start position:0%
not as open to hearing stories from
 
00:21:56.310 --> 00:21:56.320 align:start position:0%
constituents as some of US
 
00:21:58.070 --> 00:21:58.080 align:start position:0%
representatives are and as a result they
 
00:22:00.909 --> 00:22:00.919 align:start position:0%
can be flippant not listening in in
 
00:22:02.430 --> 00:22:02.440 align:start position:0%
conversations and that can create
 
00:22:05.590 --> 00:22:05.600 align:start position:0%
friction that leads to um people feeling
 
00:22:07.830 --> 00:22:07.840 align:start position:0%
like their situation wasn't properly
 
00:22:09.350 --> 00:22:09.360 align:start position:0%
addressed and I I think that's what
 
00:22:12.750 --> 00:22:12.760 align:start position:0%
happened here the as far as I understand
 
00:22:15.230 --> 00:22:15.240 align:start position:0%
the governor's office said to me on the
 
00:22:18.390 --> 00:22:18.400 align:start position:0%
house floor and we almost had um change
 
00:22:19.909 --> 00:22:19.919 align:start position:0%
on they they said to me that there was
 
00:22:22.230 --> 00:22:22.240 align:start position:0%
no they didn't see any issues with the
 
00:22:23.909 --> 00:22:23.919 align:start position:0%
text in the legislation is what Harold
 
00:22:26.990 --> 00:22:27.000 align:start position:0%
Parker had told me um whether that's the
 
00:22:28.950 --> 00:22:28.960 align:start position:0%
governor's official position or not I
 
00:22:30.430 --> 00:22:30.440 align:start position:0%
you know Harold parkle told me that in
 
00:22:32.750 --> 00:22:32.760 align:start position:0%
the on in the hallway and I'm not saying
 
00:22:34.909 --> 00:22:34.919 align:start position:0%
it is with all due respect to Governor
 
00:22:38.230 --> 00:22:38.240 align:start position:0%
shunu um my point and I think
 
00:22:41.029 --> 00:22:41.039 align:start position:0%
representative nle Illustrated this
 
00:22:43.149 --> 00:22:43.159 align:start position:0%
properly this isn't necess this isn't
 
00:22:46.029 --> 00:22:46.039 align:start position:0%
about at all actually their situation um
 
00:22:47.630 --> 00:22:47.640 align:start position:0%
I think Maryann scotus would say that
 
00:22:49.230 --> 00:22:49.240 align:start position:0%
too this is about making sure that
 
00:22:52.390 --> 00:22:52.400 align:start position:0%
there's in law codified uh a system of
 
00:22:55.789 --> 00:22:55.799 align:start position:0%
accountability which as I mentioned in
 
00:22:58.510 --> 00:22:58.520 align:start position:0%
past testimony on this legislation does
 
00:23:00.430 --> 00:23:00.440 align:start position:0%
as you mentioned exist in police
 
00:23:03.310 --> 00:23:03.320 align:start position:0%
departments across the state already and
 
00:23:06.350 --> 00:23:06.360 align:start position:0%
I think this legislation codifies what
 
00:23:09.590 --> 00:23:09.600 align:start position:0%
uh already exists and if you know the
 
00:23:11.110 --> 00:23:11.120 align:start position:0%
difference of opinion comes some some
 
00:23:12.590 --> 00:23:12.600 align:start position:0%
people think it's already working and it
 
00:23:13.870 --> 00:23:13.880 align:start position:0%
already exists some people think we
 
00:23:16.230 --> 00:23:16.240 align:start position:0%
should make sure it's codified so that
 
00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:18.510 align:start position:0%
should make sure it's codified so that
it

00:23:18.510 --> 00:23:18.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:22.590 --> 00:23:22.600 align:start position:0%
works representative Roy thank you um
 
00:23:25.230 --> 00:23:25.240 align:start position:0%
couple couple things so first off I'm
 
00:23:29.070 --> 00:23:29.080 align:start position:0%
the co-sponsor of this bill and the
 
00:23:30.990 --> 00:23:31.000 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor came to me and relayed the
 
00:23:33.669 --> 00:23:33.679 align:start position:0%
situation we're just talking about um
 
00:23:35.230 --> 00:23:35.240 align:start position:0%
and hearing that I said wow that that
 
00:23:37.590 --> 00:23:37.600 align:start position:0%
does sound pretty messed up um that
 
00:23:38.990 --> 00:23:39.000 align:start position:0%
sounds like we could this sounds like a
 
00:23:42.549 --> 00:23:42.559 align:start position:0%
decent idea so after agreeing to
 
00:23:44.830 --> 00:23:44.840 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor I I started doing research
 
00:23:46.310 --> 00:23:46.320 align:start position:0%
and seeing okay what's the current
 
00:23:47.750 --> 00:23:47.760 align:start position:0%
situation you know if we have a bill we
 
00:23:49.990 --> 00:23:50.000 align:start position:0%
may need to modify it and and it's
 
00:23:54.070 --> 00:23:54.080 align:start position:0%
pretty much as clear as mud um there are
 
00:23:57.549 --> 00:23:57.559 align:start position:0%
systems in place but no one really kind
 
00:23:58.909 --> 00:23:58.919 align:start position:0%
of knows what they are except for the
 
00:24:00.750 --> 00:24:00.760 align:start position:0%
people who are dealing with with them at
 
00:24:04.390 --> 00:24:04.400 align:start position:0%
the moment um so first of all like I'm
 
00:24:06.549 --> 00:24:06.559 align:start position:0%
right now involved in two separate
 
00:24:09.269 --> 00:24:09.279 align:start position:0%
incidents similar to that one with
 
00:24:11.269 --> 00:24:11.279 align:start position:0%
constituents where they feel like they
 
00:24:12.950 --> 00:24:12.960 align:start position:0%
really didn't quite get a fair Shake be
 
00:24:14.990 --> 00:24:15.000 align:start position:0%
it because someone might be perceived to
 
00:24:17.789 --> 00:24:17.799 align:start position:0%
be in a position of power or have money
 
00:24:19.669 --> 00:24:19.679 align:start position:0%
and all of a sudden inexplicable things
 
00:24:20.830 --> 00:24:20.840 align:start position:0%
are happening that you would think
 
00:24:23.470 --> 00:24:23.480 align:start position:0%
common sense says they may but then
 
00:24:25.750 --> 00:24:25.760 align:start position:0%
again on the other side you talk to a
 
00:24:27.310 --> 00:24:27.320 align:start position:0%
county attorney he says no we we looked
 
00:24:29.789 --> 00:24:29.799 align:start position:0%
at it so the issue is is that the person
 
00:24:29.799 --> 00:24:31.029 align:start position:0%
at it so the issue is is that the person
who's

00:24:31.029 --> 00:24:31.039 align:start position:0%
who's
 
00:24:34.389 --> 00:24:34.399 align:start position:0%
upset isn't able to know who to talk to
 
00:24:36.950 --> 00:24:36.960 align:start position:0%
to find out what was actually done and
 
00:24:40.310 --> 00:24:40.320 align:start position:0%
what was looked at so as far as this
 
00:24:42.070 --> 00:24:42.080 align:start position:0%
just to be clear our job here is to
 
00:24:45.470 --> 00:24:45.480 align:start position:0%
recommend to the legislature as a whole
 
00:24:47.510 --> 00:24:47.520 align:start position:0%
this is a good idea or a bad idea
 
00:24:48.750 --> 00:24:48.760 align:start position:0%
whether someone picks it up and runs
 
00:24:51.149 --> 00:24:51.159 align:start position:0%
with it is really not us but I would
 
00:24:53.029 --> 00:24:53.039 align:start position:0%
recommend to anyone who thinks that this
 
00:24:55.470 --> 00:24:55.480 align:start position:0%
is a good idea to start with a study
 
00:24:57.909 --> 00:24:57.919 align:start position:0%
committee because this is a very complex
 
00:25:00.549 --> 00:25:00.559 align:start position:0%
issue to you can't there's no way you
 
00:25:02.510 --> 00:25:02.520 align:start position:0%
can just write a bill and say for
 
00:25:04.750 --> 00:25:04.760 align:start position:0%
example if people feel like well I I
 
00:25:06.389 --> 00:25:06.399 align:start position:0%
should have someone to go to if I don't
 
00:25:08.389 --> 00:25:08.399 align:start position:0%
like the outcome of the investigation do
 
00:25:10.310 --> 00:25:10.320 align:start position:0%
you realize the amount of work that that
 
00:25:12.630 --> 00:25:12.640 align:start position:0%
would generate for the State Police I
 
00:25:14.190 --> 00:25:14.200 align:start position:0%
mean it would be hundreds and hundreds
 
00:25:16.710 --> 00:25:16.720 align:start position:0%
of cases a year would double their work
 
00:25:19.070 --> 00:25:19.080 align:start position:0%
so there would need to be criteria that
 
00:25:21.430 --> 00:25:21.440 align:start position:0%
would make that um eligible for that
 
00:25:22.669 --> 00:25:22.679 align:start position:0%
type of thing so there's a lot of little
 
00:25:24.029 --> 00:25:24.039 align:start position:0%
moving pieces that would have to be
 
00:25:25.909 --> 00:25:25.919 align:start position:0%
looked at and I would encourage whoever
 
00:25:29.710 --> 00:25:29.720 align:start position:0%
it is to get the county attorneys to get
 
00:25:32.269 --> 00:25:32.279 align:start position:0%
the chiefs of police and to get um
 
00:25:34.029 --> 00:25:34.039 align:start position:0%
victim witness Advocates get everybody
 
00:25:36.430 --> 00:25:36.440 align:start position:0%
together so that they aren't talking
 
00:25:38.470 --> 00:25:38.480 align:start position:0%
past each other and even they understand
 
00:25:40.830 --> 00:25:40.840 align:start position:0%
what the current lay of the land is so I
 
00:25:42.310 --> 00:25:42.320 align:start position:0%
I would definitely recommend looking at
 
00:25:45.549 --> 00:25:45.559 align:start position:0%
it if someone wants to first as a study
 
00:25:47.870 --> 00:25:47.880 align:start position:0%
and I mean a real study um because it's
 
00:25:51.029 --> 00:25:51.039 align:start position:0%
got it it's got so much complexity to it
 
00:25:52.590 --> 00:25:52.600 align:start position:0%
that a simple piece of legislation
 
00:25:54.710 --> 00:25:54.720 align:start position:0%
written without that I feel like would
 
00:25:57.430 --> 00:25:57.440 align:start position:0%
either be ineffective or worse it could
 
00:26:00.190 --> 00:26:00.200 align:start position:0%
lead to worse outcomes so that that's my
 
00:26:03.310 --> 00:26:03.320 align:start position:0%
take on the whole subject thanks
 
00:26:05.590 --> 00:26:05.600 align:start position:0%
representative celik thank you so much
 
00:26:08.590 --> 00:26:08.600 align:start position:0%
and to echo part of what um
 
00:26:12.269 --> 00:26:12.279 align:start position:0%
representative Roy said is the idea of
 
00:26:14.269 --> 00:26:14.279 align:start position:0%
the lack of understanding of the process
 
00:26:15.710 --> 00:26:15.720 align:start position:0%
my recollection the part of the
 
00:26:17.269 --> 00:26:17.279 align:start position:0%
discussion was there was so much
 
00:26:18.710 --> 00:26:18.720 align:start position:0%
confusion on the part of the family
 
00:26:21.110 --> 00:26:21.120 align:start position:0%
about where to turn to next and as I
 
00:26:22.510 --> 00:26:22.520 align:start position:0%
tried to understand the process and
 
00:26:24.470 --> 00:26:24.480 align:start position:0%
spoke to different people it didn't seem
 
00:26:26.029 --> 00:26:26.039 align:start position:0%
like there was Clarity so I would
 
00:26:27.630 --> 00:26:27.640 align:start position:0%
encourage if anyone did pursue this
 
00:26:27.640 --> 00:26:28.750 align:start position:0%
encourage if anyone did pursue this
further

00:26:28.750 --> 00:26:28.760 align:start position:0%
further
 
00:26:31.510 --> 00:26:31.520 align:start position:0%
that part of it should really be about
 
00:26:34.870 --> 00:26:34.880 align:start position:0%
how to communicate effective ways of
 
00:26:37.669 --> 00:26:37.679 align:start position:0%
tracking the information like having a
 
00:26:39.549 --> 00:26:39.559 align:start position:0%
maybe that's where the codification
 
00:26:41.909 --> 00:26:41.919 align:start position:0%
needs to come in is what are the steps
 
00:26:43.830 --> 00:26:43.840 align:start position:0%
that people can take how do we
 
00:26:46.110 --> 00:26:46.120 align:start position:0%
understand who our person is that we
 
00:26:49.389 --> 00:26:49.399 align:start position:0%
reach out to I think that having public
 
00:26:52.310 --> 00:26:52.320 align:start position:0%
comprehension of how the process works
 
00:26:56.110 --> 00:26:56.120 align:start position:0%
is is crucial just just asn't there was
 
00:26:58.230 --> 00:26:58.240 align:start position:0%
another law we had about you know stop
 
00:26:59.870 --> 00:26:59.880 align:start position:0%
stopping uh people taking breathalyzers
 
00:27:01.630 --> 00:27:01.640 align:start position:0%
and much of it was just people don't
 
00:27:03.029 --> 00:27:03.039 align:start position:0%
understand the current law because they
 
00:27:04.389 --> 00:27:04.399 align:start position:0%
don't remember from when they were 16
 
00:27:05.870 --> 00:27:05.880 align:start position:0%
years old
 
00:27:07.950 --> 00:27:07.960 align:start position:0%
so it's a different that was a different
 
00:27:09.350 --> 00:27:09.360 align:start position:0%
law but there was confusion around that
 
00:27:11.830 --> 00:27:11.840 align:start position:0%
one for similar reasons it's kind of
 
00:27:13.510 --> 00:27:13.520 align:start position:0%
scary a 16-year-old have to take a
 
00:27:18.669 --> 00:27:18.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:21.990 --> 00:27:22.000 align:start position:0%
Newman as as I read this law I came
 
00:27:24.630 --> 00:27:24.640 align:start position:0%
across my pet peeve for legislative
 
00:27:27.230 --> 00:27:27.240 align:start position:0%
language and I agree that this is a good
 
00:27:30.110 --> 00:27:30.120 align:start position:0%
idea it needs to be studied and I would
 
00:27:31.549 --> 00:27:31.559 align:start position:0%
have the people that look at the
 
00:27:34.389 --> 00:27:34.399 align:start position:0%
language in the bill look at one word
 
00:27:35.789 --> 00:27:35.799 align:start position:0%
and that word is
 
00:27:40.149 --> 00:27:40.159 align:start position:0%
shall shall or may when you take May and
 
00:27:41.509 --> 00:27:41.519 align:start position:0%
I don't know what the current law says
 
00:27:43.950 --> 00:27:43.960 align:start position:0%
but it probably says may request and
 
00:27:47.149 --> 00:27:47.159 align:start position:0%
this says shall request and that almost
 
00:27:50.110 --> 00:27:50.120 align:start position:0%
makes it a requirement so you need to
 
00:27:52.830 --> 00:27:52.840 align:start position:0%
figure out which one of them do you
 
00:27:56.070 --> 00:27:56.080 align:start position:0%
really want and I in my think thought
 
00:27:59.269 --> 00:27:59.279 align:start position:0%
process is is probably still to be a and
 
00:28:01.190 --> 00:28:01.200 align:start position:0%
think about what happens with the bill
 
00:28:02.909 --> 00:28:02.919 align:start position:0%
and all the recommendations that said we
 
00:28:08.110 --> 00:28:08.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:11.389 --> 00:28:11.399 align:start position:0%
thought thank you representative Murray
 
00:28:13.549 --> 00:28:13.559 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um I just wanted
 
00:28:16.190 --> 00:28:16.200 align:start position:0%
to make clear that this doesn't codify
 
00:28:19.750 --> 00:28:19.760 align:start position:0%
an existing process it institutes a new
 
00:28:21.990 --> 00:28:22.000 align:start position:0%
process um like representative Roy said
 
00:28:25.070 --> 00:28:25.080 align:start position:0%
it would add a new greater burden on the
 
00:28:26.509 --> 00:28:26.519 align:start position:0%
state police which is not what the
 
00:28:28.509 --> 00:28:28.519 align:start position:0%
process is right now so this is isn't
 
00:28:30.470 --> 00:28:30.480 align:start position:0%
about codifying something that's already
 
00:28:32.990 --> 00:28:33.000 align:start position:0%
in place um it institutes a whole
 
00:28:35.310 --> 00:28:35.320 align:start position:0%
different process I agree this issue
 
00:28:36.870 --> 00:28:36.880 align:start position:0%
deserves more study and I think there
 
00:28:38.430 --> 00:28:38.440 align:start position:0%
are definitely things we can do to
 
00:28:40.630 --> 00:28:40.640 align:start position:0%
improve um you know communication
 
00:28:42.750 --> 00:28:42.760 align:start position:0%
between law enforcement and victims and
 
00:28:45.710 --> 00:28:45.720 align:start position:0%
make sure that everybody has a path to
 
00:28:47.350 --> 00:28:47.360 align:start position:0%
you know at least understanding the
 
00:28:50.149 --> 00:28:50.159 align:start position:0%
result that they got um but I definitely
 
00:28:52.950 --> 00:28:52.960 align:start position:0%
do not think this legislation um in its
 
00:28:56.470 --> 00:28:56.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:00.149 --> 00:29:00.159 align:start position:0%
that anybody else good all right I will
 
00:29:04.710 --> 00:29:04.720 align:start position:0%
close the work session for House Bill
 
00:29:29.110 --> 00:29:29.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:31.669 --> 00:29:31.679 align:start position:0%
I hereby open the uh work session on
 
00:29:35.590 --> 00:29:35.600 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 244 relative to bail for a
 
00:29:38.509 --> 00:29:38.519 align:start position:0%
defendant ohcap 1 248 relative to bail
 
00:29:41.350 --> 00:29:41.360 align:start position:0%
for defendant um I'll I'll just kick it
 
00:29:43.909 --> 00:29:43.919 align:start position:0%
off by saying that um I'm I'm really
 
00:29:46.990 --> 00:29:47.000 align:start position:0%
tired of that word um the b word bail I
 
00:29:49.230 --> 00:29:49.240 align:start position:0%
think I think I think we've done
 
00:29:51.230 --> 00:29:51.240 align:start position:0%
everything we can and we need to sit
 
00:29:53.029 --> 00:29:53.039 align:start position:0%
back and let's see how this works what
 
00:29:55.269 --> 00:29:55.279 align:start position:0%
we've just put in place was extremely
 
00:29:57.750 --> 00:29:57.760 align:start position:0%
complex um I think it was extremely
 
00:29:59.269 --> 00:29:59.279 align:start position:0%
benef official for the citizens in
 
00:30:01.789 --> 00:30:01.799 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and E any further tampering
 
00:30:03.230 --> 00:30:03.240 align:start position:0%
with that at this current point before
 
00:30:05.389 --> 00:30:05.399 align:start position:0%
it takes effect in full and we see how
 
00:30:07.990 --> 00:30:08.000 align:start position:0%
it works would be very dangerous but um
 
00:30:11.669 --> 00:30:11.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:14.549 --> 00:30:14.559 align:start position:0%
comments I said let's kill it yeah well
 
00:30:17.110 --> 00:30:17.120 align:start position:0%
we'll get we'll get to that um with no
 
00:30:18.630 --> 00:30:18.640 align:start position:0%
further comments I I think that we'll go
 
00:30:20.269 --> 00:30:20.279 align:start position:0%
ahead and close that work session and
 
00:30:23.350 --> 00:30:23.360 align:start position:0%
it's right for um voting on this
 
00:30:26.149 --> 00:30:26.159 align:start position:0%
afternoon with that I open the executive
 
00:30:28.509 --> 00:30:28.519 align:start position:0%
the work session on Senate Bill 3 21
 
00:30:30.029 --> 00:30:30.039 align:start position:0%
relative to lease a defendant pending
 
00:30:30.039 --> 00:30:30.750 align:start position:0%
relative to lease a defendant pending
the

00:30:30.750 --> 00:30:30.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:30:34.630 --> 00:30:34.640 align:start position:0%
trial and I um wish to just reiterate
 
00:30:39.230 --> 00:30:39.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:41.710 --> 00:30:41.720 align:start position:0%
discussion seeing none I hereby close
 
00:30:42.590 --> 00:30:42.600 align:start position:0%
that work
 
00:30:45.310 --> 00:30:45.320 align:start position:0%
session I open the work session on
 
00:30:47.230 --> 00:30:47.240 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill
 
00:30:49.669 --> 00:30:49.679 align:start position:0%
415 relative to the penalty for certain
 
00:30:52.789 --> 00:30:52.799 align:start position:0%
fentel related offenses um this one's a
 
00:30:54.350 --> 00:30:54.360 align:start position:0%
little different now this is I believe
 
00:30:55.750 --> 00:30:55.760 align:start position:0%
if I recall this was the one that would
 
00:30:58.549 --> 00:30:58.559 align:start position:0%
make it a felony for is this the one for
 
00:31:00.870 --> 00:31:00.880 align:start position:0%
possession or importing does anyone have
 
00:31:04.110 --> 00:31:04.120 align:start position:0%
that you have it
 
00:31:04.120 --> 00:31:08.110 align:start position:0%
that you have it
possession

00:31:08.110 --> 00:31:08.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:10.870 --> 00:31:10.880 align:start position:0%
possession so this one surely we have
 
00:31:13.430 --> 00:31:13.440 align:start position:0%
some opinions on
 
00:31:17.149 --> 00:31:17.159 align:start position:0%
um I do believe and this is my my
 
00:31:18.950 --> 00:31:18.960 align:start position:0%
personal opinion from observations I've
 
00:31:22.470 --> 00:31:22.480 align:start position:0%
seen over the last six years that we
 
00:31:25.750 --> 00:31:25.760 align:start position:0%
have tried um we have tried and and it's
 
00:31:27.909 --> 00:31:27.919 align:start position:0%
worked to a certain extent various form
 
00:31:31.230 --> 00:31:31.240 align:start position:0%
forms of mitigation of harm mitigation
 
00:31:33.710 --> 00:31:33.720 align:start position:0%
um we've tried the testing part I I
 
00:31:35.509 --> 00:31:35.519 align:start position:0%
believe our overdoses are way down
 
00:31:39.549 --> 00:31:39.559 align:start position:0%
because we've um got the um I almost
 
00:31:42.029 --> 00:31:42.039 align:start position:0%
said the antidote but the
 
00:31:42.039 --> 00:31:43.549 align:start position:0%
said the antidote but the
um

00:31:43.549 --> 00:31:43.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:31:46.509 --> 00:31:46.519 align:start position:0%
Naran out into the public at a much
 
00:31:48.149 --> 00:31:48.159 align:start position:0%
greater rate our police officers all
 
00:31:50.110 --> 00:31:50.120 align:start position:0%
have it our EMTs all have it and I
 
00:31:51.629 --> 00:31:51.639 align:start position:0%
believe citizens are actually can get it
 
00:31:53.549 --> 00:31:53.559 align:start position:0%
now and carry it so that that's a that's
 
00:31:54.750 --> 00:31:54.760 align:start position:0%
a big
 
00:31:58.430 --> 00:31:58.440 align:start position:0%
plus we do not want to criminalize in
 
00:32:01.750 --> 00:32:01.760 align:start position:0%
any way addiction addiction is disease
 
00:32:04.590 --> 00:32:04.600 align:start position:0%
just like alcoholism bar various mental
 
00:32:08.629 --> 00:32:08.639 align:start position:0%
illnesses but we do have to find a way
 
00:32:11.430 --> 00:32:11.440 align:start position:0%
to interdict the flow of drugs into the
 
00:32:13.909 --> 00:32:13.919 align:start position:0%
state and the people that are pedling
 
00:32:16.230 --> 00:32:16.240 align:start position:0%
this and making profit off of people's
 
00:32:18.149 --> 00:32:18.159 align:start position:0%
suffering because at the end of the day
 
00:32:19.549 --> 00:32:19.559 align:start position:0%
all the things I just listed in the
 
00:32:21.470 --> 00:32:21.480 align:start position:0%
mitigation or the harm reduction and
 
00:32:24.509 --> 00:32:24.519 align:start position:0%
mitigation are all treating symptoms
 
00:32:27.310 --> 00:32:27.320 align:start position:0%
it's like you know taking taking Advil
 
00:32:29.269 --> 00:32:29.279 align:start position:0%
for a headache but not understanding
 
00:32:31.029 --> 00:32:31.039 align:start position:0%
it's because you have narrow arteries
 
00:32:33.029 --> 00:32:33.039 align:start position:0%
you're going to have a stroke I I think
 
00:32:36.750 --> 00:32:36.760 align:start position:0%
we need to stiffen the penalties to show
 
00:32:39.230 --> 00:32:39.240 align:start position:0%
the public how serious we take this
 
00:32:42.750 --> 00:32:42.760 align:start position:0%
fentanyl problem it's being manufactured
 
00:32:44.870 --> 00:32:44.880 align:start position:0%
out of the outside the country um it's
 
00:32:47.190 --> 00:32:47.200 align:start position:0%
almost impossible to stop be it to a
 
00:32:49.710 --> 00:32:49.720 align:start position:0%
border or FedEx or UPS it's just there's
 
00:32:54.590 --> 00:32:54.600 align:start position:0%
so much of it um we can't keep up so at
 
00:32:56.269 --> 00:32:56.279 align:start position:0%
the same time as we hope our federal
 
00:32:58.269 --> 00:32:58.279 align:start position:0%
Partners will do their job and interdict
 
00:33:00.269 --> 00:33:00.279 align:start position:0%
this stuff coming in it's getting here
 
00:33:02.310 --> 00:33:02.320 align:start position:0%
we need to send a message that we are
 
00:33:04.750 --> 00:33:04.760 align:start position:0%
not going to tolerate the poisoning of
 
00:33:07.830 --> 00:33:07.840 align:start position:0%
our children in this state and I think
 
00:33:11.070 --> 00:33:11.080 align:start position:0%
that it is worthy of of legislation to
 
00:33:12.710 --> 00:33:12.720 align:start position:0%
make that message clear especially in
 
00:33:15.310 --> 00:33:15.320 align:start position:0%
light of the fact that many of us want
 
00:33:16.909 --> 00:33:16.919 align:start position:0%
to legalize
 
00:33:19.269 --> 00:33:19.279 align:start position:0%
marijuana we we have to differentiate
 
00:33:20.669 --> 00:33:20.679 align:start position:0%
those two things we're not saying we
 
00:33:25.909 --> 00:33:25.919 align:start position:0%
approve drugs now we're saying this is a
 
00:33:28.629 --> 00:33:28.639 align:start position:0%
substance similar to alcohol
 
00:33:31.430 --> 00:33:31.440 align:start position:0%
that can be used in a certain way this
 
00:33:35.230 --> 00:33:35.240 align:start position:0%
is always poison always so I feel like
 
00:33:37.830 --> 00:33:37.840 align:start position:0%
that differentiation needs to be clear
 
00:33:40.470 --> 00:33:40.480 align:start position:0%
sharp and to the point um with that I'll
 
00:33:43.830 --> 00:33:43.840 align:start position:0%
open for conversation represent n thank
 
00:33:46.789 --> 00:33:46.799 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair um I think especially you
 
00:33:49.149 --> 00:33:49.159 align:start position:0%
know given what we had heard from um
 
00:33:50.430 --> 00:33:50.440 align:start position:0%
people who came in and testified who
 
00:33:51.750 --> 00:33:51.760 align:start position:0%
work in the recovery community and
 
00:33:54.909 --> 00:33:54.919 align:start position:0%
things like that um I I agree that there
 
00:33:57.149 --> 00:33:57.159 align:start position:0%
should be a distinction um but I think
 
00:33:59.669 --> 00:33:59.679 align:start position:0%
that that is very difficult to make in
 
00:34:01.549 --> 00:34:01.559 align:start position:0%
uh for two reasons number one because
 
00:34:04.629 --> 00:34:04.639 align:start position:0%
fenol is pervasive it is in everything
 
00:34:06.750 --> 00:34:06.760 align:start position:0%
and we have implemented some testing and
 
00:34:08.909 --> 00:34:08.919 align:start position:0%
analyzing strips that's one thing um but
 
00:34:11.869 --> 00:34:11.879 align:start position:0%
it requires people to have knowledge of
 
00:34:13.349 --> 00:34:13.359 align:start position:0%
how much is in there the other thing
 
00:34:16.270 --> 00:34:16.280 align:start position:0%
that people spoke about um was the idea
 
00:34:18.310 --> 00:34:18.320 align:start position:0%
that people's tolerance uh changes and
 
00:34:20.190 --> 00:34:20.200 align:start position:0%
so when we talk about a definitive
 
00:34:23.310 --> 00:34:23.320 align:start position:0%
amount that varies per person so
 
00:34:25.389 --> 00:34:25.399 align:start position:0%
individual people who are not uh
 
00:34:28.909 --> 00:34:28.919 align:start position:0%
trafficking um individuals who who as
 
00:34:31.149 --> 00:34:31.159 align:start position:0%
you said um struggle with substance use
 
00:34:33.430 --> 00:34:33.440 align:start position:0%
disorder something that we you know uh
 
00:34:35.829 --> 00:34:35.839 align:start position:0%
acknowledge as a you know mental health
 
00:34:37.589 --> 00:34:37.599 align:start position:0%
and and things like that that that has
 
00:34:40.149 --> 00:34:40.159 align:start position:0%
physical um ramifications on the body
 
00:34:43.270 --> 00:34:43.280 align:start position:0%
that changes your uh your physiology
 
00:34:45.190 --> 00:34:45.200 align:start position:0%
what happens is when people's tolerance
 
00:34:47.750 --> 00:34:47.760 align:start position:0%
goes up because of those um physiolog
 
00:34:50.470 --> 00:34:50.480 align:start position:0%
physiological changes that um this
 
00:34:52.270 --> 00:34:52.280 align:start position:0%
number that we are putting on it to
 
00:34:53.829 --> 00:34:53.839 align:start position:0%
Define what is the difference between
 
00:34:56.829 --> 00:34:56.839 align:start position:0%
someone who is um a user and someone who
 
00:34:59.990 --> 00:35:00.000 align:start position:0%
is um um uh trafficking that number
 
00:35:03.230 --> 00:35:03.240 align:start position:0%
becomes very very fuzzy um and then what
 
00:35:05.069 --> 00:35:05.079 align:start position:0%
we end up doing is because we have set
 
00:35:07.150 --> 00:35:07.160 align:start position:0%
this number we have ens snared people
 
00:35:09.910 --> 00:35:09.920 align:start position:0%
who just have a uh uh an issue that has
 
00:35:13.030 --> 00:35:13.040 align:start position:0%
further progressed than maybe others um
 
00:35:15.430 --> 00:35:15.440 align:start position:0%
and their tolerance is up thank you
 
00:35:18.630 --> 00:35:18.640 align:start position:0%
representative Murray thank you Mr chair
 
00:35:21.109 --> 00:35:21.119 align:start position:0%
um I just wanted to share that no one
 
00:35:23.630 --> 00:35:23.640 align:start position:0%
came and testified in support of this
 
00:35:26.190 --> 00:35:26.200 align:start position:0%
bill when we had the public hearing um
 
00:35:28.710 --> 00:35:28.720 align:start position:0%
and additionally the way this is written
 
00:35:32.109 --> 00:35:32.119 align:start position:0%
it includes the dilutant for fentanyl in
 
00:35:34.990 --> 00:35:35.000 align:start position:0%
this measurement um which if you know
 
00:35:37.109 --> 00:35:37.119 align:start position:0%
you know cannabis can be laced with
 
00:35:39.670 --> 00:35:39.680 align:start position:0%
fenel so for example it would be really
 
00:35:41.950 --> 00:35:41.960 align:start position:0%
easy for someone to get charged with
 
00:35:45.109 --> 00:35:45.119 align:start position:0%
this mandatory minimum who had cannabis
 
00:35:46.670 --> 00:35:46.680 align:start position:0%
maybe knowingly or unknowingly that was
 
00:35:48.990 --> 00:35:49.000 align:start position:0%
Lac with feny because it would be a lot
 
00:35:51.790 --> 00:35:51.800 align:start position:0%
easier to get to 5 gr of cannabis that's
 
00:35:54.510 --> 00:35:54.520 align:start position:0%
Le fentanyl than just 5 G of fentanyl
 
00:35:57.430 --> 00:35:57.440 align:start position:0%
it's not about just purely the fentanyl
 
00:35:59.109 --> 00:35:59.119 align:start position:0%
do includes the
 
00:36:01.390 --> 00:36:01.400 align:start position:0%
dilutant I would just clarify that a
 
00:36:03.510 --> 00:36:03.520 align:start position:0%
dilutant is um the definition is
 
00:36:05.750 --> 00:36:05.760 align:start position:0%
something that dilutes it makes it
 
00:36:07.829 --> 00:36:07.839 align:start position:0%
weaker I don't you can't put marijuana
 
00:36:10.109 --> 00:36:10.119 align:start position:0%
into fentanyl to dilute it you would add
 
00:36:12.030 --> 00:36:12.040 align:start position:0%
fentanyl to marijuana so I don't think
 
00:36:14.710 --> 00:36:14.720 align:start position:0%
that that would count I think dilutant
 
00:36:17.630 --> 00:36:17.640 align:start position:0%
would mean um with cocaine it would be
 
00:36:19.230 --> 00:36:19.240 align:start position:0%
like um or it could be cocaine that's
 
00:36:21.150 --> 00:36:21.160 align:start position:0%
the dilutant it could be with like you
 
00:36:23.349 --> 00:36:23.359 align:start position:0%
would use baking soda delute cocaine I
 
00:36:25.150 --> 00:36:25.160 align:start position:0%
think that that's what that that means
 
00:36:26.870 --> 00:36:26.880 align:start position:0%
but your point is taken um
 
00:36:26.880 --> 00:36:30.390 align:start position:0%
but your point is taken um
representative

00:36:30.390 --> 00:36:30.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:33.589 --> 00:36:33.599 align:start position:0%
Newman I want to agree with
 
00:36:36.710 --> 00:36:36.720 align:start position:0%
representative new we do need to send a
 
00:36:39.950 --> 00:36:39.960 align:start position:0%
message mandatory minimums are not the
 
00:36:44.109 --> 00:36:44.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:46.750 --> 00:36:46.760 align:start position:0%
message thank you representative roades
 
00:36:47.950 --> 00:36:47.960 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr
 
00:36:49.950 --> 00:36:49.960 align:start position:0%
chairman so we have heard a lot of
 
00:36:53.150 --> 00:36:53.160 align:start position:0%
mention about dealers don't know what is
 
00:36:55.309 --> 00:36:55.319 align:start position:0%
in it or what they're necessarily giving
 
00:36:57.230 --> 00:36:57.240 align:start position:0%
somebody but they clearly know that
 
00:37:01.150 --> 00:37:01.160 align:start position:0%
they're giving somebody drugs and a
 
00:37:05.430 --> 00:37:05.440 align:start position:0%
deadly substance right and somehow we as
 
00:37:08.190 --> 00:37:08.200 align:start position:0%
a society have sent a message that
 
00:37:10.230 --> 00:37:10.240 align:start position:0%
depending on a person's
 
00:37:12.309 --> 00:37:12.319 align:start position:0%
status is whether or not we're going to
 
00:37:14.190 --> 00:37:14.200 align:start position:0%
charge the person that delivered a
 
00:37:16.670 --> 00:37:16.680 align:start position:0%
deadly substance with a crime so I will
 
00:37:19.710 --> 00:37:19.720 align:start position:0%
refer everybody to a Hollywood actor
 
00:37:22.710 --> 00:37:22.720 align:start position:0%
that died in a hot tub
 
00:37:25.550 --> 00:37:25.560 align:start position:0%
right he clearly had a
 
00:37:29.510 --> 00:37:29.520 align:start position:0%
disease they charged the dealer and he
 
00:37:33.190 --> 00:37:33.200 align:start position:0%
was arrested right so the message was
 
00:37:35.630 --> 00:37:35.640 align:start position:0%
well he's more important than people in
 
00:37:37.349 --> 00:37:37.359 align:start position:0%
Manchester people in New Hampshire
 
00:37:39.190 --> 00:37:39.200 align:start position:0%
people in Chester County he's not any
 
00:37:41.069 --> 00:37:41.079 align:start position:0%
more important he made more money
 
00:37:42.950 --> 00:37:42.960 align:start position:0%
probably than all of us but he wasn't
 
00:37:45.550 --> 00:37:45.560 align:start position:0%
more important the same thing
 
00:37:47.829 --> 00:37:47.839 align:start position:0%
happened with a very popular singer that
 
00:37:51.069 --> 00:37:51.079 align:start position:0%
died right they charged the people that
 
00:37:54.670 --> 00:37:54.680 align:start position:0%
gave the deadly substances so we're not
 
00:37:57.150 --> 00:37:57.160 align:start position:0%
talking about charging the people that
 
00:37:59.670 --> 00:37:59.680 align:start position:0%
are taking the deadly substance that's
 
00:38:02.790 --> 00:38:02.800 align:start position:0%
the issue of recovery we are talking
 
00:38:06.309 --> 00:38:06.319 align:start position:0%
about the people that are knowingly and
 
00:38:09.470 --> 00:38:09.480 align:start position:0%
willingly giving these deadly substances
 
00:38:11.870 --> 00:38:11.880 align:start position:0%
to our children to our parents to our
 
00:38:14.550 --> 00:38:14.560 align:start position:0%
grandparents and people are dying this
 
00:38:17.190 --> 00:38:17.200 align:start position:0%
isn't making an excuse for the person
 
00:38:18.950 --> 00:38:18.960 align:start position:0%
that's doing it it's holding those
 
00:38:21.630 --> 00:38:21.640 align:start position:0%
accountable that are willing to kill our
 
00:38:21.640 --> 00:38:23.589 align:start position:0%
accountable that are willing to kill our
community

00:38:23.589 --> 00:38:23.599 align:start position:0%
community
 
00:38:25.870 --> 00:38:25.880 align:start position:0%
members thank you I just want to add a
 
00:38:27.550 --> 00:38:27.560 align:start position:0%
couple things um based on what I've
 
00:38:30.470 --> 00:38:30.480 align:start position:0%
heard um we often put a lot of um a lot
 
00:38:32.910 --> 00:38:32.920 align:start position:0%
of emphasis on who came and testified
 
00:38:35.309 --> 00:38:35.319 align:start position:0%
and who showed up and who didn't and
 
00:38:38.230 --> 00:38:38.240 align:start position:0%
that is worthy of not among many factors
 
00:38:41.349 --> 00:38:41.359 align:start position:0%
but keep in mind that I as a as a
 
00:38:44.990 --> 00:38:45.000 align:start position:0%
advocate for this um 30 3,400 people
 
00:38:48.550 --> 00:38:48.560 align:start position:0%
showed up in the person of me and 34
 
00:38:50.069 --> 00:38:50.079 align:start position:0%
more hundred showed up in the person of
 
00:38:51.990 --> 00:38:52.000 align:start position:0%
Representative wheeler maybe against it
 
00:38:54.109 --> 00:38:54.119 align:start position:0%
so we have to remember even if no one
 
00:38:56.069 --> 00:38:56.079 align:start position:0%
shows up to testify against the bill in
 
00:38:59.309 --> 00:38:59.319 align:start position:0%
this room we've got you know 30 40,000
 
00:39:01.510 --> 00:39:01.520 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire citizens speaking so it's
 
00:39:03.390 --> 00:39:03.400 align:start position:0%
important to not downplay our own role
 
00:39:07.829 --> 00:39:07.839 align:start position:0%
in this um second of all um with regard
 
00:39:09.470 --> 00:39:09.480 align:start position:0%
to what representative Newell said about
 
00:39:12.190 --> 00:39:12.200 align:start position:0%
the the amount um that is definitely
 
00:39:13.829 --> 00:39:13.839 align:start position:0%
something that the new piece of
 
00:39:16.230 --> 00:39:16.240 align:start position:0%
legislation would have to look at five
 
00:39:18.190 --> 00:39:18.200 align:start position:0%
grams of fentanyl would kill everybody
 
00:39:20.030 --> 00:39:20.040 align:start position:0%
with probably within five square blocks
 
00:39:23.589 --> 00:39:23.599 align:start position:0%
of here if not more so is that enough to
 
00:39:25.870 --> 00:39:25.880 align:start position:0%
say that you're a dealer because you
 
00:39:30.270 --> 00:39:30.280 align:start position:0%
have that much or if you are using to a
 
00:39:32.150 --> 00:39:32.160 align:start position:0%
certain amount that that might only be
 
00:39:34.230 --> 00:39:34.240 align:start position:0%
two days worth for you so I think some
 
00:39:36.190 --> 00:39:36.200 align:start position:0%
scientific answers have to be put in
 
00:39:38.230 --> 00:39:38.240 align:start position:0%
place before we arrive at a number I'm
 
00:39:39.910 --> 00:39:39.920 align:start position:0%
not sure that that was done I think a
 
00:39:41.990 --> 00:39:42.000 align:start position:0%
lot of times we just pick numbers based
 
00:39:44.069 --> 00:39:44.079 align:start position:0%
on you know how much how much will this
 
00:39:46.270 --> 00:39:46.280 align:start position:0%
kill how many people will this kill the
 
00:39:48.630 --> 00:39:48.640 align:start position:0%
question is is because of Tolerance how
 
00:39:51.470 --> 00:39:51.480 align:start position:0%
much can a single person take before you
 
00:39:54.030 --> 00:39:54.040 align:start position:0%
could say that's no way just for you so
 
00:39:56.510 --> 00:39:56.520 align:start position:0%
I I I I advocate for this legislation
 
00:39:59.870 --> 00:39:59.880 align:start position:0%
but I advocate for science to back it um
 
00:40:02.349 --> 00:40:02.359 align:start position:0%
yes representative thank you so much I
 
00:40:04.870 --> 00:40:04.880 align:start position:0%
just I have uh one echo of
 
00:40:06.589 --> 00:40:06.599 align:start position:0%
Representative Newman and one question
 
00:40:08.870 --> 00:40:08.880 align:start position:0%
one is just that historically we've seen
 
00:40:11.150 --> 00:40:11.160 align:start position:0%
that mandatory minimum sentences
 
00:40:13.470 --> 00:40:13.480 align:start position:0%
ultimately cause more problems than they
 
00:40:15.990 --> 00:40:16.000 align:start position:0%
solve and I would invite whoever chooses
 
00:40:17.750 --> 00:40:17.760 align:start position:0%
to move forward with this legislation or
 
00:40:20.710 --> 00:40:20.720 align:start position:0%
similar to look at alternative ways that
 
00:40:24.270 --> 00:40:24.280 align:start position:0%
allow judges who we appoint for the
 
00:40:26.630 --> 00:40:26.640 align:start position:0%
purpose of having their discretion use
 
00:40:28.990 --> 00:40:29.000 align:start position:0%
it in an appropriate and suitable way
 
00:40:30.870 --> 00:40:30.880 align:start position:0%
and just be able to consider whatever
 
00:40:32.750 --> 00:40:32.760 align:start position:0%
factors are necessary in making
 
00:40:35.030 --> 00:40:35.040 align:start position:0%
sentencing that doesn't mean it I I
 
00:40:37.990 --> 00:40:38.000 align:start position:0%
don't support criminalizing the behavior
 
00:40:40.470 --> 00:40:40.480 align:start position:0%
or increasing penalties but I just mean
 
00:40:41.790 --> 00:40:41.800 align:start position:0%
I think we need to keep in mind
 
00:40:43.750 --> 00:40:43.760 align:start position:0%
mandatory minimums don't generally help
 
00:40:46.390 --> 00:40:46.400 align:start position:0%
problems and the other is I would invite
 
00:40:49.790 --> 00:40:49.800 align:start position:0%
anyone who's reviewing this um as a as a
 
00:40:51.349 --> 00:40:51.359 align:start position:0%
woman of a certain age and having had a
 
00:40:53.349 --> 00:40:53.359 align:start position:0%
conversation with a gastroenterologist
 
00:40:55.390 --> 00:40:55.400 align:start position:0%
recently where they talked about one of
 
00:40:56.829 --> 00:40:56.839 align:start position:0%
the methods of making sure I wasn't
 
00:40:58.750 --> 00:40:58.760 align:start position:0%
awake during a certain procedure would
 
00:41:00.910 --> 00:41:00.920 align:start position:0%
be incorporating fentanyl into an
 
00:41:03.109 --> 00:41:03.119 align:start position:0%
anesthetic program so that the medical
 
00:41:05.630 --> 00:41:05.640 align:start position:0%
uses of certain drugs that we would not
 
00:41:08.589 --> 00:41:08.599 align:start position:0%
want on the street are not accidentally
 
00:41:10.550 --> 00:41:10.560 align:start position:0%
uh being
 
00:41:13.309 --> 00:41:13.319 align:start position:0%
criminalized yeah well I I don't I don't
 
00:41:15.150 --> 00:41:15.160 align:start position:0%
believe that um people with a
 
00:41:16.430 --> 00:41:16.440 align:start position:0%
prescription for fentanyl would be
 
00:41:19.270 --> 00:41:19.280 align:start position:0%
caught up in that um I would say that
 
00:41:21.510 --> 00:41:21.520 align:start position:0%
fentanyl is a common drug in a hospital
 
00:41:23.550 --> 00:41:23.560 align:start position:0%
as a matter of fact um when I used to
 
00:41:25.030 --> 00:41:25.040 align:start position:0%
work as an investigator for the Board of
 
00:41:28.230 --> 00:41:28.240 align:start position:0%
Medicine down south um one of the first
 
00:41:32.630 --> 00:41:32.640 align:start position:0%
cases I caught was a ER doc who was
 
00:41:34.829 --> 00:41:34.839 align:start position:0%
diverting fentel out of a crash cart
 
00:41:36.430 --> 00:41:36.440 align:start position:0%
because when you intubate somebody
 
00:41:38.349 --> 00:41:38.359 align:start position:0%
fentel is the first thing you do and the
 
00:41:39.750 --> 00:41:39.760 align:start position:0%
horrific result of that is people were
 
00:41:41.950 --> 00:41:41.960 align:start position:0%
being intubated without it um which can
 
00:41:44.829 --> 00:41:44.839 align:start position:0%
cause enormous stress so fenel is is
 
00:41:48.270 --> 00:41:48.280 align:start position:0%
does have perfectly great uses um and I
 
00:41:49.790 --> 00:41:49.800 align:start position:0%
don't think that legislation like that
 
00:41:51.910 --> 00:41:51.920 align:start position:0%
should catch that up in there um one
 
00:41:54.589 --> 00:41:54.599 align:start position:0%
more thing on the minimum mandatories I
 
00:41:56.150 --> 00:41:56.160 align:start position:0%
think we're going to agree to disagree
 
00:41:58.390 --> 00:41:58.400 align:start position:0%
on that I think that um statistics
 
00:42:01.550 --> 00:42:01.560 align:start position:0%
depending on who you who you ask um or
 
00:42:04.109 --> 00:42:04.119 align:start position:0%
or which study you look at show effects
 
00:42:06.870 --> 00:42:06.880 align:start position:0%
both ways but I would rely on the
 
00:42:08.630 --> 00:42:08.640 align:start position:0%
gentleman who came here who had already
 
00:42:11.470 --> 00:42:11.480 align:start position:0%
served time as a drug dealer and he said
 
00:42:13.069 --> 00:42:13.079 align:start position:0%
you want to stop the reason we didn't
 
00:42:14.309 --> 00:42:14.319 align:start position:0%
used to come up here and deal in the
 
00:42:15.910 --> 00:42:15.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is because we knew you had
 
00:42:18.109 --> 00:42:18.119 align:start position:0%
minimum mandatories when those went away
 
00:42:20.109 --> 00:42:20.119 align:start position:0%
the drugs came with them so maybe
 
00:42:23.150 --> 00:42:23.160 align:start position:0%
anecdotal but it's certainly worthy of
 
00:42:25.750 --> 00:42:25.760 align:start position:0%
consideration um anyone other hands on
 
00:42:27.710 --> 00:42:27.720 align:start position:0%
this one
 
00:42:29.589 --> 00:42:29.599 align:start position:0%
seeing none I'll close the work
 
00:42:33.710 --> 00:42:33.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:37.510 --> 00:42:37.520 align:start position:0%
will open the work session on Senate
 
00:42:40.190 --> 00:42:40.200 align:start position:0%
Bill 425 relative to bail commission
 
00:42:42.670 --> 00:42:42.680 align:start position:0%
fees um I think we've dealt with that we
 
00:42:44.710 --> 00:42:44.720 align:start position:0%
gave them a nice little bump anyone want
 
00:42:46.309 --> 00:42:46.319 align:start position:0%
to talk about
 
00:42:49.390 --> 00:42:49.400 align:start position:0%
it seeing none I closed the work
 
00:42:52.589 --> 00:42:52.599 align:start position:0%
session next I open a work session on
 
00:42:53.829 --> 00:42:53.839 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill
 
00:42:55.870 --> 00:42:55.880 align:start position:0%
464 prohibiting the consensual
 
00:42:57.990 --> 00:42:58.000 align:start position:0%
non-consensual dissemination of a syn
 
00:43:01.069 --> 00:43:01.079 align:start position:0%
sexual synthetic image and I open that
 
00:43:04.109 --> 00:43:04.119 align:start position:0%
up for discussion um I'm not sure if it
 
00:43:05.390 --> 00:43:05.400 align:start position:0%
seems like we had a lot of bills
 
00:43:06.950 --> 00:43:06.960 align:start position:0%
regarding this last year I'm not sure if
 
00:43:09.430 --> 00:43:09.440 align:start position:0%
anything actually made it through or not
 
00:43:11.549 --> 00:43:11.559 align:start position:0%
um if it didn't I would I would say that
 
00:43:14.069 --> 00:43:14.079 align:start position:0%
we probably should look at it if it did
 
00:43:15.470 --> 00:43:15.480 align:start position:0%
we should wait and see what comes with
 
00:43:18.230 --> 00:43:18.240 align:start position:0%
that Mr chair
 
00:43:22.069 --> 00:43:22.079 align:start position:0%
yes uh there was a bill that was passed
 
00:43:24.829 --> 00:43:24.839 align:start position:0%
and signed um it was a house bill not a
 
00:43:26.270 --> 00:43:26.280 align:start position:0%
Senate bill and it was pretty much the
 
00:43:27.870 --> 00:43:27.880 align:start position:0%
exact same bill
 
00:43:29.150 --> 00:43:29.160 align:start position:0%
if I recall that was the one that
 
00:43:31.030 --> 00:43:31.040 align:start position:0%
representative Muse was talking about or
 
00:43:32.910 --> 00:43:32.920 align:start position:0%
sponsored yeah representative Muse my
 
00:43:35.589 --> 00:43:35.599 align:start position:0%
myself and a couple other couple other I
 
00:43:37.150 --> 00:43:37.160 align:start position:0%
don't know on here but yeah okay so if
 
00:43:39.309 --> 00:43:39.319 align:start position:0%
we got one passed we should wait and see
 
00:43:41.430 --> 00:43:41.440 align:start position:0%
how that works any comments questions
 
00:43:43.750 --> 00:43:43.760 align:start position:0%
thoughts seeing none I will close the
 
00:43:46.190 --> 00:43:46.200 align:start position:0%
work session with that I open the work
 
00:43:49.750 --> 00:43:49.760 align:start position:0%
session on Senate Bill 578 relative to
 
00:43:51.750 --> 00:43:51.760 align:start position:0%
criminal pre-trial services and
 
00:43:54.950 --> 00:43:54.960 align:start position:0%
monitoring this is again a bail kind of
 
00:43:56.790 --> 00:43:56.800 align:start position:0%
issue I think we dealt with this already
 
00:44:00.190 --> 00:44:00.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:02.309 --> 00:44:02.319 align:start position:0%
bill represent wheeler I would just
 
00:44:04.230 --> 00:44:04.240 align:start position:0%
really quickly mention that I do think
 
00:44:05.750 --> 00:44:05.760 align:start position:0%
criminal pre-child services and
 
00:44:08.630 --> 00:44:08.640 align:start position:0%
monitoring are an important step forward
 
00:44:11.390 --> 00:44:11.400 align:start position:0%
in the long-term thinking for the state
 
00:44:12.950 --> 00:44:12.960 align:start position:0%
to be moving for I mean the budget next
 
00:44:14.630 --> 00:44:14.640 align:start position:0%
year is going to be a little tough but
 
00:44:17.309 --> 00:44:17.319 align:start position:0%
in the long longer term thinking about
 
00:44:19.470 --> 00:44:19.480 align:start position:0%
bams moving forward once we have a more
 
00:44:21.109 --> 00:44:21.119 align:start position:0%
stable economy and things like that I
 
00:44:23.069 --> 00:44:23.079 align:start position:0%
think we do need to start looking into
 
00:44:24.990 --> 00:44:25.000 align:start position:0%
similar to how we did here last year
 
00:44:26.750 --> 00:44:26.760 align:start position:0%
updating the criminal justice system in
 
00:44:28.870 --> 00:44:28.880 align:start position:0%
ways and I think the work that's being
 
00:44:30.390 --> 00:44:30.400 align:start position:0%
done in straford county and the other
 
00:44:31.630 --> 00:44:31.640 align:start position:0%
counties across the state around
 
00:44:33.430 --> 00:44:33.440 align:start position:0%
pre-trial services and monitoring show
 
00:44:35.589 --> 00:44:35.599 align:start position:0%
that that might be one of those ways too
 
00:44:37.349 --> 00:44:37.359 align:start position:0%
I I actually agree I believe that the
 
00:44:39.190 --> 00:44:39.200 align:start position:0%
bill package that we sent forward and
 
00:44:41.950 --> 00:44:41.960 align:start position:0%
was signed in law tasked the uh
 
00:44:45.109 --> 00:44:45.119 align:start position:0%
commission for criminal justice to um
 
00:44:47.990 --> 00:44:48.000 align:start position:0%
actually look at pre-trial services and
 
00:44:49.950 --> 00:44:49.960 align:start position:0%
see if there was a Statewide model that
 
00:44:51.470 --> 00:44:51.480 align:start position:0%
they could use maybe a straford to
 
00:44:53.430 --> 00:44:53.440 align:start position:0%
someone else and come up with funding
 
00:44:55.390 --> 00:44:55.400 align:start position:0%
methods to help reimburse counties who
 
00:44:57.750 --> 00:44:57.760 align:start position:0%
chose to adopt it so I think we're I
 
00:44:59.510 --> 00:44:59.520 align:start position:0%
agree we need to head down that path and
 
00:45:02.829 --> 00:45:02.839 align:start position:0%
at least uniform so that um your level
 
00:45:05.829 --> 00:45:05.839 align:start position:0%
of services that you get don't depend on
 
00:45:08.030 --> 00:45:08.040 align:start position:0%
what ZIP code you get arrested in so
 
00:45:08.040 --> 00:45:08.990 align:start position:0%
what ZIP code you get arrested in so
repr

00:45:08.990 --> 00:45:09.000 align:start position:0%
repr
 
00:45:12.349 --> 00:45:12.359 align:start position:0%
n um just a point Thank you Mr chair um
 
00:45:13.829 --> 00:45:13.839 align:start position:0%
just point a clarification because I
 
00:45:15.950 --> 00:45:15.960 align:start position:0%
think that with this bill it it doesn't
 
00:45:18.270 --> 00:45:18.280 align:start position:0%
aim to implement pre-trial monitoring
 
00:45:19.589 --> 00:45:19.599 align:start position:0%
and and things like that what it does is
 
00:45:22.349 --> 00:45:22.359 align:start position:0%
it says that if you cannot pay for it um
 
00:45:23.549 --> 00:45:23.559 align:start position:0%
it should be paid for if you are
 
00:45:26.549 --> 00:45:26.559 align:start position:0%
Indigent then it it should be um P that
 
00:45:27.790 --> 00:45:27.800 align:start position:0%
you should not be responsible for the
 
00:45:29.270 --> 00:45:29.280 align:start position:0%
cost of it right if you if you can't pay
 
00:45:30.950 --> 00:45:30.960 align:start position:0%
for it so that's the question that this
 
00:45:32.670 --> 00:45:32.680 align:start position:0%
bill is asking it's not whether we
 
00:45:34.710 --> 00:45:34.720 align:start position:0%
should implement it it's how it is
 
00:45:36.190 --> 00:45:36.200 align:start position:0%
funded and whether people who cannot
 
00:45:37.430 --> 00:45:37.440 align:start position:0%
afford it can still have it without
 
00:45:39.589 --> 00:45:39.599 align:start position:0%
being able can still Avail themselves of
 
00:45:43.670 --> 00:45:43.680 align:start position:0%
that option um uh and and not be stuck
 
00:45:46.990 --> 00:45:47.000 align:start position:0%
with a giant bill I think well that that
 
00:45:49.270 --> 00:45:49.280 align:start position:0%
opens a whole new can of worms in as
 
00:45:51.630 --> 00:45:51.640 align:start position:0%
much as any pre-trial services that are
 
00:45:53.910 --> 00:45:53.920 align:start position:0%
offered are offered on a county bycount
 
00:45:56.150 --> 00:45:56.160 align:start position:0%
basis and the county governments fund it
 
00:45:57.710 --> 00:45:57.720 align:start position:0%
so I don't think we would be able to
 
00:45:59.430 --> 00:45:59.440 align:start position:0%
tell the counties you can't charge
 
00:46:01.069 --> 00:46:01.079 align:start position:0%
people for it that's an unfunded mandate
 
00:46:03.109 --> 00:46:03.119 align:start position:0%
so we would have to come up with fund
 
00:46:05.270 --> 00:46:05.280 align:start position:0%
every thingle every single piece of it
 
00:46:06.990 --> 00:46:07.000 align:start position:0%
and since it's not uniform one County
 
00:46:08.870 --> 00:46:08.880 align:start position:0%
may be giving amazing stuff that's very
 
00:46:10.750 --> 00:46:10.760 align:start position:0%
expensive and another County may not
 
00:46:13.270 --> 00:46:13.280 align:start position:0%
have much so I I think this the answer
 
00:46:15.390 --> 00:46:15.400 align:start position:0%
to the question you just raised has to
 
00:46:17.750 --> 00:46:17.760 align:start position:0%
be part of a uniform pre-trial Services
 
00:46:19.710 --> 00:46:19.720 align:start position:0%
across the state I would I would think
 
00:46:23.150 --> 00:46:23.160 align:start position:0%
but thank you anyone
 
00:46:25.710 --> 00:46:25.720 align:start position:0%
else yes represent s thank you I don't
 
00:46:26.750 --> 00:46:26.760 align:start position:0%
actually have anything on this bill but
 
00:46:28.109 --> 00:46:28.119 align:start position:0%
one once you close the hearing if I
 
00:46:29.430 --> 00:46:29.440 align:start position:0%
might be allowed to make a very brief
 
00:46:30.870 --> 00:46:30.880 align:start position:0%
announcement to the committee that would
 
00:46:33.950 --> 00:46:33.960 align:start position:0%
be great sure um seeing nothing further
 
00:46:36.870 --> 00:46:36.880 align:start position:0%
I hereby close the work session on
 
00:46:39.670 --> 00:46:39.680 align:start position:0%
578 we will convene again at 1: p.m. to
 
00:46:41.230 --> 00:46:41.240 align:start position:0%
vote on these it shouldn't take more
 
00:46:47.030 --> 00:46:47.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:49.790 --> 00:46:49.800 align:start position:0%
um well I would I would first of all
 
00:46:53.190 --> 00:46:53.200 align:start position:0%
disagree with the uh Stupid um I didn't
 
00:46:54.470 --> 00:46:54.480 align:start position:0%
know how long these would take so I had
 
00:46:57.470 --> 00:46:57.480 align:start position:0%
to plan had to give it time I I don't
 
00:46:59.510 --> 00:46:59.520 align:start position:0%
know if I can I'll have we can't no it's
 
00:47:00.750 --> 00:47:00.760 align:start position:0%
noticed in the calendar and that's when
 
00:47:03.510 --> 00:47:03.520 align:start position:0%
it has to be one o00 um so yeah that
 
00:47:05.750 --> 00:47:05.760 align:start position:0%
gives us a couple hours um if you can't
 
00:47:07.549 --> 00:47:07.559 align:start position:0%
go if you can't stay as long as we have
 
00:47:09.790 --> 00:47:09.800 align:start position:0%
a quorum just make sure you let me or
 
00:47:15.750 --> 00:47:15.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:18.589 --> 00:47:18.599 align:start position:0%
quorum okay well I am sorry that you are
 
00:47:21.670 --> 00:47:21.680 align:start position:0%
unhappy um any further comments none uh
 
00:47:23.589 --> 00:47:23.599 align:start position:0%
representative s go ahead thank you so
 
00:47:25.390 --> 00:47:25.400 align:start position:0%
much um I sent an email out to the
 
00:47:27.430 --> 00:47:27.440 align:start position:0%
committee which hopefully ever everyone
 
00:47:28.790 --> 00:47:28.800 align:start position:0%
received about an event that I've
 
00:47:31.910 --> 00:47:31.920 align:start position:0%
brought um through my other hat to UNH
 
00:47:34.710 --> 00:47:34.720 align:start position:0%
later uh this fall it'll be October 23rd
 
00:47:36.950 --> 00:47:36.960 align:start position:0%
it's a presentation called aftermath
 
00:47:39.470 --> 00:47:39.480 align:start position:0%
which specifically talks about pts and
 
00:47:41.790 --> 00:47:41.800 align:start position:0%
First Responders so there's a scripted
 
00:47:43.829 --> 00:47:43.839 align:start position:0%
play reading followed by a facilitated
 
00:47:45.630 --> 00:47:45.640 align:start position:0%
discussion and I just think it's a
 
00:47:47.190 --> 00:47:47.200 align:start position:0%
really valuable program I wanted to make
 
00:47:48.790 --> 00:47:48.800 align:start position:0%
everyone aware of it it is free to
 
00:47:50.750 --> 00:47:50.760 align:start position:0%
attend we do have a sign up just to make
 
00:47:53.109 --> 00:47:53.119 align:start position:0%
sure we don't overfill the room um and
 
00:47:54.630 --> 00:47:54.640 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to share information with
 
00:47:55.710 --> 00:47:55.720 align:start position:0%
anyone but I just wanted to make sure
 
00:47:56.990 --> 00:47:57.000 align:start position:0%
you all saw it because I think it's
 
00:48:00.270 --> 00:48:00.280 align:start position:0%
something worthy of all of our attention
 
00:48:01.549 --> 00:48:01.559 align:start position:0%
thank you for sharing that with us and
 
00:48:02.829 --> 00:48:02.839 align:start position:0%
bringing that to our attention and if
 
00:48:04.190 --> 00:48:04.200 align:start position:0%
you don't recall it check your emails
 
00:48:05.910 --> 00:48:05.920 align:start position:0%
it's in there uh representative Pratt
 
00:48:08.309 --> 00:48:08.319 align:start position:0%
just what was the location of that it
 
00:48:09.430 --> 00:48:09.440 align:start position:0%
will be at the University of New
 
00:48:11.390 --> 00:48:11.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire in Durham okay thank
 
00:48:14.109 --> 00:48:14.119 align:start position:0%
you um I think the the email had the
 
00:48:16.150 --> 00:48:16.160 align:start position:0%
exact address and you could link it and
 
00:48:17.670 --> 00:48:17.680 align:start position:0%
it would take you to a web page so that
 
00:48:19.390 --> 00:48:19.400 align:start position:0%
would probably be helpful with that I
 
00:48:25.750 --> 00:48:25.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:25.760 --> 00:48:55.710 align:start position:0%

Prevail so I'm going to recognize that
 
03:01:40.389 --> 03:01:40.399 align:start position:0%
side to make all the Motions um that way
 
03:01:42.830 --> 03:01:42.840 align:start position:0%
we're not doing a double vote count um I
 
03:01:45.269 --> 03:01:45.279 align:start position:0%

03:13:26.510 --> 03:13:26.520 align:start position:0%
one I'm pretty sure where we all know
 
03:13:28.950 --> 03:13:28.960 align:start position:0%
and come down on it so I'd ask cler col
 
03:13:32.070 --> 03:13:32.080 align:start position:0%
roll excuse me representative UMES like
 
03:13:35.269 --> 03:13:35.279 align:start position:0%
to U Echo something I heard before and
 
03:13:38.030 --> 03:13:38.040 align:start position:0%
that's that I think the concept is great
 
03:13:40.670 --> 03:13:40.680 align:start position:0%
uh but uh like some others I don't want
 
03:13:43.830 --> 03:13:43.840 align:start position:0%
to vote for a mandatory minimum but I'll
 
03:13:47.229 --> 03:13:47.239 align:start position:0%

anyia Mr chairman I think we worked
 
03:20:58.429 --> 03:20:58.439 align:start position:0%
tremendously together I think we were
 
03:21:00.030 --> 03:21:00.040 align:start position:0%
the best Committee in the legislature
 
03:21:02.110 --> 03:21:02.120 align:start position:0%
and I watch a lot of them and I really
 
03:21:04.030 --> 03:21:04.040 align:start position:0%
appreciate the work that you put in
 
03:21:05.670 --> 03:21:05.680 align:start position:0%
making this committee work bipartisanly
 
03:21:07.469 --> 03:21:07.479 align:start position:0%
and making us be able to get a lot of
 
03:21:08.870 --> 03:21:08.880 align:start position:0%
good work done from this committee I
 
03:21:10.590 --> 03:21:10.600 align:start position:0%
really appreciate that and I agree the
 
03:21:14.429 --> 03:21:14.439 align:start position:0%
other committees do stink um qu question
 
03:21:16.110 --> 03:21:16.120 align:start position:0%
yes question of our illustrious and
 
03:21:18.309 --> 03:21:18.319 align:start position:0%
amazing chairman yes do we not need to
 
03:21:21.790 --> 03:21:21.800 align:start position:0%
vote uh more than once to eventually
 
03:21:23.189 --> 03:21:23.199 align:start position:0%
make no
 
03:21:26.309 --> 03:21:26.319 align:start position:0%
recommendation do do we not have to fail
 
03:21:27.910 --> 03:21:27.920 align:start position:0%
multiple votes I don't think so I think
 
03:21:29.110 --> 03:21:29.120 align:start position:0%
if the vote is tied that means we
 
03:21:31.349 --> 03:21:31.359 align:start position:0%
couldn't agree Oh I thought a tied vote
 
03:21:34.349 --> 03:21:34.359 align:start position:0%
meant that the motion failed it doesn't
 
03:21:38.030 --> 03:21:38.040 align:start position:0%
mean no recommendation unless a a a
 
03:21:40.710 --> 03:21:40.720 align:start position:0%
different motion also fails I don't know
 
03:21:43.150 --> 03:21:43.160 align:start position:0%
I don't know only one report is there
 
03:21:44.269 --> 03:21:44.279 align:start position:0%
yeah there's only one report there's no
 
03:21:46.870 --> 03:21:46.880 align:start position:0%
Minority Report on any of these so I
 
03:21:48.389 --> 03:21:48.399 align:start position:0%
don't think that it would matter what
 
03:21:51.309 --> 03:21:51.319 align:start position:0%
said there AE yeah that's what
 
03:21:54.670 --> 03:21:54.680 align:start position:0%
we it's only a tie there's a tie that it
 
03:21:57.469 --> 03:21:57.479 align:start position:0%
was a tie in that she voted um she voted
 
03:22:01.469 --> 03:22:01.479 align:start position:0%
wrong no it was a tie not her voted was
 
03:22:05.110 --> 03:22:05.120 align:start position:0%
a tie she that sheong would have
 
03:22:08.229 --> 03:22:08.239 align:start position:0%
switched become 98 that's what I said
 
03:22:11.070 --> 03:22:11.080 align:start position:0%
okay so it would be 98 okay so you have
 
03:22:13.269 --> 03:22:13.279 align:start position:0%
to vote on the other the other motion
 
03:22:16.630 --> 03:22:16.640 align:start position:0%
yeah we do why are you here I'll glad
 
03:22:18.429 --> 03:22:18.439 align:start position:0%

03:22:21.710 --> 03:22:21.720 align:start position:0%

03:22:28.630 --> 03:22:28.640 align:start position:0%
that I I reopen the executive session by
 
03:22:31.389 --> 03:22:31.399 align:start position:0%
my magical power um on Senate bill which
 
03:22:34.750 --> 03:22:34.760 align:start position:0%
one was it 415 and I recognize
 
03:22:40.389 --> 03:22:40.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:44.229 --> 03:22:44.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:49.910 --> 03:22:49.920 align:start position:0%
it uh I make a motion to not recommend
 
03:22:52.150 --> 03:22:52.160 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 415 relative to penalty for
 
03:22:54.950 --> 03:22:54.960 align:start position:0%
certain fenel related offenses for
 
03:22:58.309 --> 03:22:58.319 align:start position:0%
further um legislation okay seconded
 
03:23:00.189 --> 03:23:00.199 align:start position:0%
seconded by Representative no I'd ask
 
03:23:01.349 --> 03:23:01.359 align:start position:0%
the clerk to call the RO the motion
 
03:23:03.309 --> 03:23:03.319 align:start position:0%
floor oh wait a minute don't we have to
 
03:23:07.910 --> 03:23:07.920 align:start position:0%
undo the no because it failed I think we
 
03:23:09.510 --> 03:23:09.520 align:start position:0%
have now we have
 
03:23:14.110 --> 03:23:14.120 align:start position:0%
to question what uh can the clerk repeat
 
03:23:16.030 --> 03:23:16.040 align:start position:0%
what the vote result was the first time
 
03:23:20.389 --> 03:23:20.399 align:start position:0%
we voted on this the vote was 989 to
 
03:23:23.070 --> 03:23:23.080 align:start position:0%
recommend but it was not what you wanted
 
03:23:25.550 --> 03:23:25.560 align:start position:0%
it to be I'm sorry can you repeat that
 
03:23:28.349 --> 03:23:28.359 align:start position:0%
the vote was 98 not to recommend and
 
03:23:30.229 --> 03:23:30.239 align:start position:0%
representative Murphy voted on the
 
03:23:32.150 --> 03:23:32.160 align:start position:0%
prevailing side in wait a minute if it's
 
03:23:33.510 --> 03:23:33.520 align:start position:0%
not to recommend that's what you wanted
 
03:23:36.910 --> 03:23:36.920 align:start position:0%
I'm mean to recommend I'm leaving okay
 
03:23:40.910 --> 03:23:40.920 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry so it was 9 to8 and we have
 
03:23:43.309 --> 03:23:43.319 align:start position:0%
that yeah she just is going to correct v
 
03:23:46.469 --> 03:23:46.479 align:start position:0%
n in favor of not recom nine in favor of
 
03:23:48.710 --> 03:23:48.720 align:start position:0%
recommending and eight against
 
03:23:52.550 --> 03:23:52.560 align:start position:0%
recommending and there are 17 people in
 
03:23:56.150 --> 03:23:56.160 align:start position:0%
this room so everyone voted yeah it so I
 
03:23:57.950 --> 03:23:57.960 align:start position:0%
think the only way that if someone
 
03:23:59.150 --> 03:23:59.160 align:start position:0%
messed up their vote the only way we
 
03:24:00.469 --> 03:24:00.479 align:start position:0%
could change that is if someone makes a
 
03:24:02.389 --> 03:24:02.399 align:start position:0%
motion to reconsider well no because
 
03:24:04.830 --> 03:24:04.840 align:start position:0%
think about it she we vote she voted one
 
03:24:07.670 --> 03:24:07.680 align:start position:0%
way right and that actually came out to
 
03:24:10.510 --> 03:24:10.520 align:start position:0%
be tied didn't
 
03:24:14.870 --> 03:24:14.880 align:start position:0%
it 9 to8 isn't that's
 
03:24:17.229 --> 03:24:17.239 align:start position:0%
right oh my God the work we're doing on
 
03:24:19.189 --> 03:24:19.199 align:start position:0%
a bill that can't go anywhere y like I
 
03:24:21.990 --> 03:24:22.000 align:start position:0%
am the clerk and Bradley is here let us
 
03:24:24.590 --> 03:24:24.600 align:start position:0%
talk about
 
03:24:26.750 --> 03:24:26.760 align:start position:0%
it motion to reconsider is that what we
 
03:24:30.269 --> 03:24:30.279 align:start position:0%
need to do so if if she voted the
 
03:24:30.279 --> 03:24:32.590 align:start position:0%
need to do so if if she voted the
wrong

03:24:32.590 --> 03:24:32.600 align:start position:0%
wrong
 
03:24:36.550 --> 03:24:36.560 align:start position:0%
then so recommendation
 
03:24:39.309 --> 03:24:39.319 align:start position:0%
ofing that failed so you don't need to
 
03:24:40.790 --> 03:24:40.800 align:start position:0%
Reb on
 
03:24:40.800 --> 03:24:43.229 align:start position:0%
Reb on
that

03:24:43.229 --> 03:24:43.239 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:24:46.429 --> 03:24:46.439 align:start position:0%
8 to vote not okay we don't need to
 
03:24:49.150 --> 03:24:49.160 align:start position:0%
consider any of that it failed
 
03:24:53.429 --> 03:24:53.439 align:start position:0%
so we're not recing it you don't need to
 
03:24:55.990 --> 03:24:56.000 align:start position:0%

03:24:58.349 --> 03:24:58.359 align:start position:0%

03:25:32.630 --> 03:25:32.640 align:start position:0%
time the CL the first motion was to
 
03:25:36.349 --> 03:25:36.359 align:start position:0%
recommend that motion prevailed by 9 to8
 
03:25:39.150 --> 03:25:39.160 align:start position:0%
but representative Murray uh Murphy
 
03:25:41.030 --> 03:25:41.040 align:start position:0%
voted on the prevailing side and error
 
03:25:43.150 --> 03:25:43.160 align:start position:0%
