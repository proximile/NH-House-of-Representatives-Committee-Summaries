meeting of the special committee on the
 
00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:06.800 align:start position:0%
Family Division of the circuit court and
 
00:06:10.309 --> 00:06:10.319 align:start position:0%
our purpose today is to look at the
 
00:06:13.309 --> 00:06:13.319 align:start position:0%
final report and make a decision on it
 
00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:16.720 align:start position:0%
let me give you my opening intro at the
 
00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:19.840 align:start position:0%
end of which maybe you'll have some
 
00:06:23.909 --> 00:06:23.919 align:start position:0%
things to ask or things to say this big
 
00:06:28.309 --> 00:06:28.319 align:start position:0%
document um which is kind of what we did
 
00:06:28.319 --> 00:06:30.710 align:start position:0%
document um which is kind of what we did
Plus

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:30.720 align:start position:0%
Plus
 
00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:34.360 align:start position:0%
several items that were submitted to us
 
00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:36.520 align:start position:0%
this big document was emailed to you
 
00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:37.990 align:start position:0%
this big document was emailed to you
yesterday

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:38.000 align:start position:0%
yesterday
 
00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:41.960 align:start position:0%
afternoon in the final report about 95%
 
00:06:43.589 --> 00:06:43.599 align:start position:0%
of this was already
 
00:06:46.309 --> 00:06:46.319 align:start position:0%
approved uh one part of it the end of
 
00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:50.720 align:start position:0%
last year uh the rest of it not too long
 
00:06:51.909 --> 00:06:51.919 align:start position:0%
ago this
 
00:06:55.029 --> 00:06:55.039 align:start position:0%
year the vice chair gave us a schedule A
 
00:06:58.230 --> 00:06:58.240 align:start position:0%
Week Ago which I accepted and a few
 
00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:00.800 align:start position:0%
things happened during this past
 
00:07:05.029 --> 00:07:05.039 align:start position:0%
week uh representative long suggested
 
00:07:07.589 --> 00:07:07.599 align:start position:0%
something be included about the time he
 
00:07:10.350 --> 00:07:10.360 align:start position:0%
was sending that it occurred to me too
 
00:07:13.189 --> 00:07:13.199 align:start position:0%
great minds think alike so that should
 
00:07:17.629 --> 00:07:17.639 align:start position:0%
be in my opening remarks in the
 
00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:21.000 align:start position:0%
report uh I asked representative Greg to
 
00:07:25.029 --> 00:07:25.039 align:start position:0%
supply a date on uh a meeting and she
 
00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:28.440 align:start position:0%
did that uh a few subcommittee reports
 
00:07:32.790 --> 00:07:32.800 align:start position:0%
were partially Rewritten to update for
 
00:07:37.629 --> 00:07:37.639 align:start position:0%
example my report on Rules of Evidence
 
00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:40.160 align:start position:0%
was accurate when it was accepted last
 
00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:43.120 align:start position:0%
year but subsequent to that some things
 
00:07:45.510 --> 00:07:45.520 align:start position:0%
happened in the Judiciary and that
 
00:07:49.990 --> 00:07:50.000 align:start position:0%
needed to be mentioned so that my report
 
00:07:53.110 --> 00:07:53.120 align:start position:0%
would be up to dat I think one other
 
00:07:57.430 --> 00:07:57.440 align:start position:0%
report was about the same the question
 
00:08:01.710 --> 00:08:01.720 align:start position:0%
was about the items that were submitted
 
00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:03.830 align:start position:0%
was about the items that were submitted
to

00:08:03.830 --> 00:08:03.840 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:08:09.990 --> 00:08:10.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:14.629 --> 00:08:14.639 align:start position:0%
items what of these should be in the
 
00:08:16.990 --> 00:08:17.000 align:start position:0%
report no suggestions were made to me
 
00:08:19.189 --> 00:08:19.199 align:start position:0%
specifically about this report or that
 
00:08:23.670 --> 00:08:23.680 align:start position:0%
report so our clerk who has been the
 
00:08:28.110 --> 00:08:28.120 align:start position:0%
repository of all the stuff uh suggested
 
00:08:32.110 --> 00:08:32.120 align:start position:0%
several I said do not want anything that
 
00:08:36.469 --> 00:08:36.479 align:start position:0%
was primarily an angry criticism of the
 
00:08:41.070 --> 00:08:41.080 align:start position:0%
court in general or naming a judge in
 
00:08:43.310 --> 00:08:43.320 align:start position:0%
particular it was not helpful it was not
 
00:08:47.230 --> 00:08:47.240 align:start position:0%
appropriate but thoughts ideas
 
00:08:51.990 --> 00:08:52.000 align:start position:0%
suggestions facts comparisons would be
 
00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:53.910 align:start position:0%
suggestions facts comparisons would be
we

00:08:53.910 --> 00:08:53.920 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:08:57.350 --> 00:08:57.360 align:start position:0%
um centered on several and that is in
 
00:09:01.069 --> 00:09:01.079 align:start position:0%
the second half of your
 
00:09:04.269 --> 00:09:04.279 align:start position:0%
document there's a lot more and arguably
 
00:09:07.509 --> 00:09:07.519 align:start position:0%
some might suggest we add this one or
 
00:09:09.790 --> 00:09:09.800 align:start position:0%
take that one out we're not going to be
 
00:09:12.870 --> 00:09:12.880 align:start position:0%
doing that today if that were the case
 
00:09:15.470 --> 00:09:15.480 align:start position:0%
it would have been submitted to me over
 
00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:16.829 align:start position:0%
it would have been submitted to me over
the

00:09:16.829 --> 00:09:16.839 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:09:19.590 --> 00:09:19.600 align:start position:0%
weekend however when I was
 
00:09:22.829 --> 00:09:22.839 align:start position:0%
appointed chairman of this special
 
00:09:26.150 --> 00:09:26.160 align:start position:0%
committee I went through the very thick
 
00:09:30.110 --> 00:09:30.120 align:start position:0%
file of previous times when the family
 
00:09:32.230 --> 00:09:32.240 align:start position:0%
court was the
 
00:09:35.030 --> 00:09:35.040 align:start position:0%
subject and anyone who wishes to do a
 
00:09:38.350 --> 00:09:38.360 align:start position:0%
deep dive can uh
 
00:09:43.110 --> 00:09:43.120 align:start position:0%
contact our committee assistants who um
 
00:09:45.670 --> 00:09:45.680 align:start position:0%
will readily make those things available
 
00:09:47.470 --> 00:09:47.480 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of stuff if somebody wants
 
00:09:51.030 --> 00:09:51.040 align:start position:0%
to do a deep dive or if this uh special
 
00:09:53.670 --> 00:09:53.680 align:start position:0%
committee is reconstituted some years
 
00:09:55.069 --> 00:09:55.079 align:start position:0%
down the
 
00:09:59.110 --> 00:09:59.120 align:start position:0%
road um arguably this or that could have
 
00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:00.310 align:start position:0%
road um arguably this or that could have
been

00:10:00.310 --> 00:10:00.320 align:start position:0%
been
 
00:10:03.389 --> 00:10:03.399 align:start position:0%
added when I was working on my doctoral
 
00:10:05.630 --> 00:10:05.640 align:start position:0%
dissertation at Boston University the
 
00:10:08.550 --> 00:10:08.560 align:start position:0%
dean pulled several of us aside and said
 
00:10:11.829 --> 00:10:11.839 align:start position:0%
turn in your dissertations please uh
 
00:10:14.269 --> 00:10:14.279 align:start position:0%
there's a deadline and we all said but
 
00:10:15.949 --> 00:10:15.959 align:start position:0%
there's another footnote I wish to add
 
00:10:17.509 --> 00:10:17.519 align:start position:0%
and there's another person I want to
 
00:10:20.949 --> 00:10:20.959 align:start position:0%
talk to and he said this could go on
 
00:10:23.470 --> 00:10:23.480 align:start position:0%
indefinitely he said as a result
 
00:10:25.710 --> 00:10:25.720 align:start position:0%
sometimes people don't get the thing
 
00:10:27.430 --> 00:10:27.440 align:start position:0%
turned in and that's the worst
 
00:10:29.350 --> 00:10:29.360 align:start position:0%
dissertation the one that has never
 
00:10:33.829 --> 00:10:33.839 align:start position:0%
turned in so same kind of a
 
00:10:36.590 --> 00:10:36.600 align:start position:0%
thing yesterday a member of this
 
00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:38.350 align:start position:0%
thing yesterday a member of this
committee

00:10:38.350 --> 00:10:38.360 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:10:41.310 --> 00:10:41.320 align:start position:0%
asked if a couple of other things could
 
00:10:44.230 --> 00:10:44.240 align:start position:0%
be added and I said no and the person
 
00:10:46.990 --> 00:10:47.000 align:start position:0%
who asked that question was me because I
 
00:10:49.110 --> 00:10:49.120 align:start position:0%
said oh my gosh we should have that in
 
00:10:52.550 --> 00:10:52.560 align:start position:0%
there well the rules were get it done by
 
00:10:54.389 --> 00:10:54.399 align:start position:0%
the weekend because we have to finalize
 
00:10:55.910 --> 00:10:55.920 align:start position:0%
it and get it out the door so I said no
 
00:10:57.550 --> 00:10:57.560 align:start position:0%
to me on
 
00:11:00.670 --> 00:11:00.680 align:start position:0%
that maybe this special committee will
 
00:11:04.350 --> 00:11:04.360 align:start position:0%
be Reed the report does not ask us to
 
00:11:07.350 --> 00:11:07.360 align:start position:0%
vote on that but it does mention the
 
00:11:10.269 --> 00:11:10.279 align:start position:0%
fact that some people here think it
 
00:11:13.750 --> 00:11:13.760 align:start position:0%
could be it might be the reason is we
 
00:11:15.430 --> 00:11:15.440 align:start position:0%
have established a good working
 
00:11:17.350 --> 00:11:17.360 align:start position:0%
relationship with the
 
00:11:20.509 --> 00:11:20.519 align:start position:0%
Judiciary and as a result we're able to
 
00:11:22.710 --> 00:11:22.720 align:start position:0%
successfully pick some loow hanging
 
00:11:24.710 --> 00:11:24.720 align:start position:0%
fruit but there's fruit a little bit
 
00:11:27.190 --> 00:11:27.200 align:start position:0%
further up the tree and maybe that can
 
00:11:29.590 --> 00:11:29.600 align:start position:0%
be addressed given our relation ship
 
00:11:30.790 --> 00:11:30.800 align:start position:0%
with the
 
00:11:34.110 --> 00:11:34.120 align:start position:0%
Judiciary that will be obviously up to
 
00:11:37.509 --> 00:11:37.519 align:start position:0%
whomever is the speaker next year and
 
00:11:39.750 --> 00:11:39.760 align:start position:0%
maybe that speaker is the same one maybe
 
00:11:41.389 --> 00:11:41.399 align:start position:0%
that speaker is a different one but it
 
00:11:45.150 --> 00:11:45.160 align:start position:0%
would be that speaker to listen to the
 
00:11:47.350 --> 00:11:47.360 align:start position:0%
suggestions of some of us if we want
 
00:11:49.790 --> 00:11:49.800 align:start position:0%
this committee
 
00:11:52.110 --> 00:11:52.120 align:start position:0%
reconstituted if that's the case some of
 
00:11:54.190 --> 00:11:54.200 align:start position:0%
the items that didn't make the cut such
 
00:11:56.269 --> 00:11:56.279 align:start position:0%
as the two things I said no to coming
 
00:11:58.910 --> 00:11:58.920 align:start position:0%
from me yesterday might just be put into
 
00:12:01.790 --> 00:12:01.800 align:start position:0%
that next report so what we're going to
 
00:12:03.430 --> 00:12:03.440 align:start position:0%
do today is look at
 
00:12:07.310 --> 00:12:07.320 align:start position:0%
errors is are there errors of fact in
 
00:12:09.629 --> 00:12:09.639 align:start position:0%
anything in the
 
00:12:12.030 --> 00:12:12.040 align:start position:0%
report because they should be corrected
 
00:12:15.230 --> 00:12:15.240 align:start position:0%
and I was overhearing a conversation um
 
00:12:17.269 --> 00:12:17.279 align:start position:0%
before we get going that there might be
 
00:12:20.230 --> 00:12:20.240 align:start position:0%
at least one error of fact so that's my
 
00:12:23.310 --> 00:12:23.320 align:start position:0%
opening Salvo if anyone has a response
 
00:12:27.430 --> 00:12:27.440 align:start position:0%
or anyone wants to dive in uh just uh
 
00:12:39.509 --> 00:12:39.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:39.519 --> 00:12:40.870 align:start position:0%
 
representative

00:12:40.870 --> 00:12:40.880 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:12:45.470 --> 00:12:45.480 align:start position:0%
katab thank you Mr chairman I just um
 
00:12:47.990 --> 00:12:48.000 align:start position:0%
had two like very minor clerical things
 
00:12:49.710 --> 00:12:49.720 align:start position:0%
I assume if we kind of put those into
 
00:12:53.790 --> 00:12:53.800 align:start position:0%
red lines that clerical things can be um
 
00:12:56.509 --> 00:12:56.519 align:start position:0%
modified would that be okay if it's an
 
00:12:59.949 --> 00:12:59.959 align:start position:0%
era of fact yes I don't want open up the
 
00:13:02.509 --> 00:13:02.519 align:start position:0%
idea of let's add this let's add that or
 
00:13:05.189 --> 00:13:05.199 align:start position:0%
it's an unending thing nope it's so it's
 
00:13:09.389 --> 00:13:09.399 align:start position:0%
just um uh judge Luna's name was spelled
 
00:13:11.750 --> 00:13:11.760 align:start position:0%
incorrectly it should have a u in there
 
00:13:15.790 --> 00:13:15.800 align:start position:0%
where are we that is on
 
00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:17.949 align:start position:0%
where are we that is on
page

00:13:17.949 --> 00:13:17.959 align:start position:0%
page
 
00:13:21.269 --> 00:13:21.279 align:start position:0%
just now this is in the sorry that's on
 
00:13:23.509 --> 00:13:23.519 align:start position:0%
the last page of the staple the last
 
00:13:26.550 --> 00:13:26.560 align:start position:0%
page of the stap in the last paragraph
 
00:13:29.750 --> 00:13:29.760 align:start position:0%
it just it's missing a u at the end
 
00:13:31.750 --> 00:13:31.760 align:start position:0%
I don't see where you are right here I
 
00:13:32.949 --> 00:13:32.959 align:start position:0%
see where you
 
00:13:36.550 --> 00:13:36.560 align:start position:0%
are uh okay uh does everyone see where
 
00:13:40.790 --> 00:13:40.800 align:start position:0%
she is and she asks if we can spell the
 
00:13:43.310 --> 00:13:43.320 align:start position:0%
the judge correctly and you have that
 
00:13:44.790 --> 00:13:44.800 align:start position:0%
one do
 
00:13:48.550 --> 00:13:48.560 align:start position:0%
you okay good thank you um we'll throw
 
00:13:51.230 --> 00:13:51.240 align:start position:0%
that in the motion to accept
 
00:13:54.629 --> 00:13:54.639 align:start position:0%
with allowed changes any
 
00:13:56.749 --> 00:13:56.759 align:start position:0%
objection um it just needs a u at the
 
00:13:59.189 --> 00:13:59.199 align:start position:0%
end of the name
 
00:13:59.199 --> 00:14:00.590 align:start position:0%
end of the name
thank

00:14:00.590 --> 00:14:00.600 align:start position:0%
thank
 
00:14:05.710 --> 00:14:05.720 align:start position:0%
you l u n e Au U okay and then there's
 
00:14:07.710 --> 00:14:07.720 align:start position:0%
one any I don't see any objection to
 
00:14:09.590 --> 00:14:09.600 align:start position:0%
that being part of our final motion go
 
00:14:12.350 --> 00:14:12.360 align:start position:0%
ahead and then there's just one minor
 
00:14:14.350 --> 00:14:14.360 align:start position:0%
missing Dash the rest have dashes just
 
00:14:15.749 --> 00:14:15.759 align:start position:0%
consistency those are the only two
 
00:14:21.189 --> 00:14:21.199 align:start position:0%
things missing a dash a hyphen H yeah
 
00:14:24.310 --> 00:14:24.320 align:start position:0%
yeah so the rest have hyphens some new
 
00:14:27.710 --> 00:14:27.720 align:start position:0%
laws this is under the document some new
 
00:14:30.949 --> 00:14:30.959 align:start position:0%
laws passed
 
00:14:35.350 --> 00:14:35.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:50.629 --> 00:14:50.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:53.670 --> 00:14:53.680 align:start position:0%
yet I don't see it but okay some new
 
00:14:57.189 --> 00:14:57.199 align:start position:0%
laws passed this is this is a very minor
 
00:15:01.949 --> 00:15:01.959 align:start position:0%
point but after HB A6 there is a hyphen
 
00:15:05.629 --> 00:15:05.639 align:start position:0%
a dash and after HB 1564 there is and
 
00:15:10.110 --> 00:15:10.120 align:start position:0%
there isn't one after HB 1005 any
 
00:15:13.790 --> 00:15:13.800 align:start position:0%
objections to that you know that the we
 
00:15:16.949 --> 00:15:16.959 align:start position:0%
do want to keep the punctuation police
 
00:15:16.959 --> 00:15:17.829 align:start position:0%
do want to keep the punctuation police
at

00:15:17.829 --> 00:15:17.839 align:start position:0%
at
 
00:15:20.590 --> 00:15:20.600 align:start position:0%
Bay okay no objection to that anything
 
00:15:23.870 --> 00:15:23.880 align:start position:0%
else that anybody sees that is a typo or
 
00:15:40.629 --> 00:15:40.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:46.629 --> 00:15:46.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:49.430 --> 00:15:49.440 align:start position:0%
make representative
 
00:15:52.470 --> 00:15:52.480 align:start position:0%
McBeth I just appreciate the the work
 
00:15:54.150 --> 00:15:54.160 align:start position:0%
that's been done this past week and the
 
00:15:56.629 --> 00:15:56.639 align:start position:0%
energy that was went into it to try to
 
00:15:58.150 --> 00:15:58.160 align:start position:0%
bring this up to where everybody would
 
00:16:03.150 --> 00:16:03.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:07.389 --> 00:16:07.399 align:start position:0%
you and while I was surprised at what my
 
00:16:09.990 --> 00:16:10.000 align:start position:0%
vice chair gave me last week I came to
 
00:16:12.710 --> 00:16:12.720 align:start position:0%
see the sense of it it was good to have
 
00:16:16.629 --> 00:16:16.639 align:start position:0%
this additional week just to make sure I
 
00:16:18.790 --> 00:16:18.800 align:start position:0%
was working under the assumption that
 
00:16:23.189 --> 00:16:23.199 align:start position:0%
this was like a um interim study report
 
00:16:26.629 --> 00:16:26.639 align:start position:0%
which was due last week and when I was
 
00:16:29.629 --> 00:16:29.639 align:start position:0%
informed that oh no it is not uh that
 
00:16:31.590 --> 00:16:31.600 align:start position:0%
did give us the week and it did give
 
00:16:35.670 --> 00:16:35.680 align:start position:0%
everybody a chance to get anything in
 
00:16:38.389 --> 00:16:38.399 align:start position:0%
that he or she wish to have come in so
 
00:16:41.430 --> 00:16:41.440 align:start position:0%
in retrospect I think this was um this
 
00:16:48.749 --> 00:16:48.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:51.110 --> 00:16:51.120 align:start position:0%
you I want to thank the committee we
 
00:16:53.350 --> 00:16:53.360 align:start position:0%
worked well as a place in my opening
 
00:16:56.030 --> 00:16:56.040 align:start position:0%
remarks where I said when I was
 
00:16:58.990 --> 00:16:59.000 align:start position:0%
appointing subcommittees
 
00:17:01.030 --> 00:17:01.040 align:start position:0%
I didn't think to balance them in terms
 
00:17:04.110 --> 00:17:04.120 align:start position:0%
of party because we weren't acting in a
 
00:17:06.069 --> 00:17:06.079 align:start position:0%
partisan fashion we were just want
 
00:17:08.549 --> 00:17:08.559 align:start position:0%
wanting to make some helpful changes
 
00:17:11.470 --> 00:17:11.480 align:start position:0%
with the Judiciary working with us I
 
00:17:15.990 --> 00:17:16.000 align:start position:0%
think the attitude of everyone was to
 
00:17:18.510 --> 00:17:18.520 align:start position:0%
let's work together and uh I think we
 
00:17:22.390 --> 00:17:22.400 align:start position:0%
did and thank you to the Judiciary
 
00:17:24.990 --> 00:17:25.000 align:start position:0%
um well nothing
 
00:17:27.470 --> 00:17:27.480 align:start position:0%
else are we ready to
 
00:17:30.710 --> 00:17:30.720 align:start position:0%
vote uh for the record to note that
 
00:17:32.950 --> 00:17:32.960 align:start position:0%
representative Deborah D Simone from
 
00:17:36.470 --> 00:17:36.480 align:start position:0%
children family law is sitting in for
 
00:17:38.870 --> 00:17:38.880 align:start position:0%
representative ball also from that
 
00:17:41.310 --> 00:17:41.320 align:start position:0%
committee I didn't know if we could do
 
00:17:43.230 --> 00:17:43.240 align:start position:0%
this this is a special committee so I
 
00:17:44.909 --> 00:17:44.919 align:start position:0%
called the speaker's office and they
 
00:17:47.190 --> 00:17:47.200 align:start position:0%
said yes and they made the appointment
 
00:17:50.549 --> 00:17:50.559 align:start position:0%
so just for the record um desimoni and
 
00:17:54.190 --> 00:17:54.200 align:start position:0%
for ball and I would like to move the
 
00:17:57.830 --> 00:17:57.840 align:start position:0%

00:18:01.909 --> 00:18:01.919 align:start position:0%
second representative
 
00:18:06.070 --> 00:18:06.080 align:start position:0%
Greg also known as our stealth weapon
 
00:18:08.430 --> 00:18:08.440 align:start position:0%
you know when you get assigned to a
 
00:18:11.230 --> 00:18:11.240 align:start position:0%
special committee the job gets done
 
00:18:13.270 --> 00:18:13.280 align:start position:0%
before your special committee can even
 
00:18:16.310 --> 00:18:16.320 align:start position:0%
convene because they listen to you and
 
00:18:18.669 --> 00:18:18.679 align:start position:0%
they said what a great idea let's go do
 
00:18:21.029 --> 00:18:21.039 align:start position:0%
