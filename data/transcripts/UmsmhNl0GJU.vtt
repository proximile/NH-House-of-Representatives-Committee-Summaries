leadership requires engagement in

governor of New Hampshire and I think my

term was a very important and memorable
 
00:24:03.890 --> 00:24:03.900 align:start position:0%
experience of my life it was such a
 
00:24:06.110 --> 00:24:06.120 align:start position:0%
unique opportunity and I met many
 
00:24:07.310 --> 00:24:07.320 align:start position:0%

term it's going to be an exciting
Adventure

00:24:12.169 --> 00:24:12.179 align:start position:0%
Adventure
 
00:24:14.390 --> 00:24:14.400 align:start position:0%
during my term I learned three things
 
00:24:16.370 --> 00:24:16.380 align:start position:0%
one is that it's helpful to reflect
 
00:24:19.370 --> 00:24:19.380 align:start position:0%
after an event or even just a
 
00:24:21.649 --> 00:24:21.659 align:start position:0%
conversation I'd reflect on what I
 
00:24:25.250 --> 00:24:25.260 align:start position:0%
learned I learned a lot second is that
 
00:24:26.930 --> 00:24:26.940 align:start position:0%
it's okay to be nervous
 
00:24:29.210 --> 00:24:29.220 align:start position:0%
nerves made the experience electric and
 
00:24:33.890 --> 00:24:33.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:37.430 --> 00:24:37.440 align:start position:0%
third our words can influence people and
 
00:24:39.710 --> 00:24:39.720 align:start position:0%
greatly affect people and touch their
 
00:24:41.750 --> 00:24:41.760 align:start position:0%
hearts I learned the influence words
 
00:24:44.390 --> 00:24:44.400 align:start position:0%
after my teacher of the year speech at
 
00:24:46.490 --> 00:24:46.500 align:start position:0%
the Bridge's house I was told I touched
 
00:24:48.529 --> 00:24:48.539 align:start position:0%
many hearts that day
 
00:24:52.070 --> 00:24:52.080 align:start position:0%
during my term I learned oh as kid
 
00:24:53.750 --> 00:24:53.760 align:start position:0%
Governor my platform was homelessness
 
00:24:55.789 --> 00:24:55.799 align:start position:0%
and it's just like and it's still a
 
00:24:58.130 --> 00:24:58.140 align:start position:0%
significant issue I felt terrible for
 
00:24:59.570 --> 00:24:59.580 align:start position:0%
people who were living in such harsh
 
00:25:01.490 --> 00:25:01.500 align:start position:0%
conditions and with no place to call
 
00:25:04.610 --> 00:25:04.620 align:start position:0%
home with the help of Luanne
 
00:25:07.130 --> 00:25:07.140 align:start position:0%
my term was spent organizing ideas that
 
00:25:10.669 --> 00:25:10.679 align:start position:0%
would help these suffering people
 
00:25:13.610 --> 00:25:13.620 align:start position:0%
throughout my term I got to implement so
 
00:25:15.590 --> 00:25:15.600 align:start position:0%
many things that I'm proud of I was the
 
00:25:17.090 --> 00:25:17.100 align:start position:0%
host on the game show Granite State
 
00:25:19.130 --> 00:25:19.140 align:start position:0%
Challenge I visited the friendly Kitchen
 
00:25:22.130 --> 00:25:22.140 align:start position:0%
in Concord I held a sock drive with my
 
00:25:24.049 --> 00:25:24.059 align:start position:0%
executive counselor Tainan as part of
 
00:25:26.570 --> 00:25:26.580 align:start position:0%
his platform I even spoke at the
 
00:25:30.110 --> 00:25:30.120 align:start position:0%
superintendent's breakfast and the 40th
 
00:25:31.789 --> 00:25:31.799 align:start position:0%
Somersworth International Children's
 
00:25:31.799 --> 00:25:33.289 align:start position:0%
Somersworth International Children's
Festival

00:25:33.289 --> 00:25:33.299 align:start position:0%
Festival
 
00:25:35.390 --> 00:25:35.400 align:start position:0%
my favorite event was the friendly
 
00:25:37.730 --> 00:25:37.740 align:start position:0%
kitchen a soup kitchen in Concord that
 
00:25:40.130 --> 00:25:40.140 align:start position:0%
helps the food insecure it was a very
 
00:25:42.350 --> 00:25:42.360 align:start position:0%
unique experience that was worth sharing
 
00:25:43.909 --> 00:25:43.919 align:start position:0%
with the world so I made a video about
 
00:25:43.919 --> 00:25:47.870 align:start position:0%
with the world so I made a video about
it

00:25:47.870 --> 00:25:47.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:50.390 --> 00:25:50.400 align:start position:0%
I took a tour of the kitchen and I ate a
 
00:25:52.490 --> 00:25:52.500 align:start position:0%
spectacular meal I think this event was
 
00:25:54.470 --> 00:25:54.480 align:start position:0%
important because it showed me that
 
00:25:55.850 --> 00:25:55.860 align:start position:0%
there are more people trying to help
 
00:25:58.130 --> 00:25:58.140 align:start position:0%
people in this world
 
00:26:00.169 --> 00:26:00.179 align:start position:0%
I think the kid Governor program has
 
00:26:02.330 --> 00:26:02.340 align:start position:0%
inspired me through Civic and social
 
00:26:04.070 --> 00:26:04.080 align:start position:0%
experiences and offered me an
 
00:26:07.610 --> 00:26:07.620 align:start position:0%
opportunities to serve my community
 
00:26:10.250 --> 00:26:10.260 align:start position:0%
it has provided me more experiences in
 
00:26:12.830 --> 00:26:12.840 align:start position:0%
the power of my words I've even written
 
00:26:15.649 --> 00:26:15.659 align:start position:0%
and delivered many great spirits many
 
00:26:17.930 --> 00:26:17.940 align:start position:0%
many great speeches with the mentorship
 
00:26:19.490 --> 00:26:19.500 align:start position:0%
of Luanne
 
00:26:21.529 --> 00:26:21.539 align:start position:0%
every day I'm learning how to be a more
 
00:26:24.110 --> 00:26:24.120 align:start position:0%
powerful writer and use my own voice I
 
00:26:25.789 --> 00:26:25.799 align:start position:0%
haven't determined what I want what I
 
00:26:27.169 --> 00:26:27.179 align:start position:0%
want to be when I grow up but I will
 
00:26:28.970 --> 00:26:28.980 align:start position:0%
never stop going out of my way to serve
 
00:26:31.490 --> 00:26:31.500 align:start position:0%
my community and make my voice be heard
 
00:26:34.070 --> 00:26:34.080 align:start position:0%
I'd like to thank Luan geneste for

[Applause]
 
00:28:16.669 --> 00:28:16.679 align:start position:0%
by the way Mrs jeunesse was my teacher
 
00:28:18.590 --> 00:28:18.600 align:start position:0%
in the fifth grade so when she came to
 
00:28:21.110 --> 00:28:21.120 align:start position:0%
us with this idea I said well I got to
 
00:28:23.930 --> 00:28:23.940 align:start position:0%
say yes my fifth Goodyear teacher so I
 
00:28:25.310 --> 00:28:25.320 align:start position:0%
just wanted to point out a couple things
 
00:28:28.610 --> 00:28:28.620 align:start position:0%
so about a few weeks ago governor sununu
 
00:28:31.430 --> 00:28:31.440 align:start position:0%
spoke from here on his inaugural address
 
00:28:33.950 --> 00:28:33.960 align:start position:0%
and he talked about first and foremost a
 
00:28:36.649 --> 00:28:36.659 align:start position:0%
very important aspect of civic education
 
00:28:38.269 --> 00:28:38.279 align:start position:0%
and how much it's important that we
 
00:28:40.450 --> 00:28:40.460 align:start position:0%
understand everything that's going on
 
00:28:43.070 --> 00:28:43.080 align:start position:0%
outside of our house everything that's
 
00:28:44.450 --> 00:28:44.460 align:start position:0%
going on in the State House everything
 
00:28:46.370 --> 00:28:46.380 align:start position:0%
that's going on nationally in politics
 
00:28:47.690 --> 00:28:47.700 align:start position:0%
and having an understanding of our
 
00:28:49.669 --> 00:28:49.679 align:start position:0%
democracy and how important it was and
 
00:28:52.370 --> 00:28:52.380 align:start position:0%
for years you know we've had some really
 
00:28:54.830 --> 00:28:54.840 align:start position:0%
smart people try to put together a
 
00:28:57.409 --> 00:28:57.419 align:start position:0%
program to try to see how we could get
 
00:28:59.630 --> 00:28:59.640 align:start position:0%
civic education for not just young
 
00:29:02.029 --> 00:29:02.039 align:start position:0%
people but all people in country
 
00:29:04.190 --> 00:29:04.200 align:start position:0%
and the mistake we made was that we
 
00:29:07.669 --> 00:29:07.679 align:start position:0%
didn't go to all of you the fifth
 
00:29:10.130 --> 00:29:10.140 align:start position:0%
graders because the fifth graders of
 
00:29:12.649 --> 00:29:12.659 align:start position:0%
course had the answer
 
00:29:14.210 --> 00:29:14.220 align:start position:0%
they knew what they wanted to
 
00:29:15.830 --> 00:29:15.840 align:start position:0%
participate in
 
00:29:18.289 --> 00:29:18.299 align:start position:0%
and this kid Governor program is exactly
 
00:29:20.630 --> 00:29:20.640 align:start position:0%
the type of thing it's because of you
 
00:29:22.730 --> 00:29:22.740 align:start position:0%
guys this is so successful
 
00:29:24.649 --> 00:29:24.659 align:start position:0%
we're now in our fifth year the speaker
 
00:29:29.029 --> 00:29:29.039 align:start position:0%
mentioned eighteen hundred students 1800
 
00:29:30.710 --> 00:29:30.720 align:start position:0%
people just like you in New Hampshire
 
00:29:33.830 --> 00:29:33.840 align:start position:0%
all throughout the state are involved
 
00:29:36.350 --> 00:29:36.360 align:start position:0%
what we really need to do is to take
 
00:29:37.850 --> 00:29:37.860 align:start position:0%
this program
 
00:29:40.610 --> 00:29:40.620 align:start position:0%
to every student in the country
 
00:29:42.409 --> 00:29:42.419 align:start position:0%
so that's for your to-do list for the
 
00:29:44.690 --> 00:29:44.700 align:start position:0%
next year you can add that
 
00:29:46.490 --> 00:29:46.500 align:start position:0%
so this is a great program we're happy
 
00:29:48.889 --> 00:29:48.899 align:start position:0%
to be partners I just like to point out
 
00:29:50.990 --> 00:29:51.000 align:start position:0%
that all um
 
00:29:53.690 --> 00:29:53.700 align:start position:0%
Luanne and Martha and Ann Camen are
 
00:29:55.970 --> 00:29:55.980 align:start position:0%
really put a lot of effort into this
 
00:29:58.070 --> 00:29:58.080 align:start position:0%
program it's we're very thankful to be
 
00:30:00.590 --> 00:30:00.600 align:start position:0%
great Partners but I want to also
 
00:30:02.990 --> 00:30:03.000 align:start position:0%
mention the fact that someone's not here
 
00:30:05.570 --> 00:30:05.580 align:start position:0%
is that our first lady Valerie sununu
 
00:30:08.210 --> 00:30:08.220 align:start position:0%
five years ago and we said hey Valerie
 
00:30:10.610 --> 00:30:10.620 align:start position:0%
first lady would you be willing to come
 
00:30:12.590 --> 00:30:12.600 align:start position:0%
we've got this idea we're doing this
 
00:30:15.649 --> 00:30:15.659 align:start position:0%
thing and she said Count Me In
 
00:30:17.750 --> 00:30:17.760 align:start position:0%
and so she's really made a difference
 
00:30:20.450 --> 00:30:20.460 align:start position:0%
for the 1800 plus students that have
 
00:30:22.610 --> 00:30:22.620 align:start position:0%
been involved just this year in the five
 
00:30:25.610 --> 00:30:25.620 align:start position:0%
years since and so we'd be remiss if we
 
00:30:27.169 --> 00:30:27.179 align:start position:0%
didn't thank her for what she did so
 
00:30:28.970 --> 00:30:28.980 align:start position:0%
congratulations we're gonna have a great
 
00:30:31.970 --> 00:30:31.980 align:start position:0%
year and thank you all for coming and
 
00:30:41.570 --> 00:30:41.580 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:45.169 --> 00:30:45.179 align:start position:0%

we have a little visual aid here
 
00:33:12.230 --> 00:33:12.240 align:start position:0%
each branch serves a different purpose
 
00:33:14.690 --> 00:33:14.700 align:start position:0%
and the branches check and balance one
 
00:33:17.509 --> 00:33:17.519 align:start position:0%
another so no one branch holds too much

00:34:53.629 --> 00:34:53.639 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is a pretty unique state
 
00:34:56.410 --> 00:34:56.420 align:start position:0%
we have the largest
 
00:34:59.810 --> 00:34:59.820 align:start position:0%
legislative body of any state in the
 
00:34:59.820 --> 00:35:00.650 align:start position:0%
legislative body of any state in the
country

00:35:00.650 --> 00:35:00.660 align:start position:0%
country
 
00:35:03.530 --> 00:35:03.540 align:start position:0%
in the New Hampshire house
 
00:35:06.650 --> 00:35:06.660 align:start position:0%
we have 400 members
 
00:35:09.410 --> 00:35:09.420 align:start position:0%
the next largest legislative body in the
 
00:35:13.310 --> 00:35:13.320 align:start position:0%
country is Pennsylvania with 203.
 
00:35:17.510 --> 00:35:17.520 align:start position:0%
we are truly the only legislative body
 
00:35:19.730 --> 00:35:19.740 align:start position:0%
in this country that is still a citizen
 
00:35:23.150 --> 00:35:23.160 align:start position:0%
legislature that is left
 
00:35:24.829 --> 00:35:24.839 align:start position:0%
do any of you know how much we get paid
 
00:35:29.630 --> 00:35:29.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:34.190 --> 00:35:34.200 align:start position:0%
we get a whole hundred dollars a year
 
00:35:34.200 --> 00:35:35.089 align:start position:0%
we get a whole hundred dollars a year
yeah

00:35:35.089 --> 00:35:35.099 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:35:37.609 --> 00:35:37.619 align:start position:0%
I see a lot of surprise faces out there
 
00:35:40.790 --> 00:35:40.800 align:start position:0%
that is our salary one hundred dollars
 
00:35:43.670 --> 00:35:43.680 align:start position:0%
but I must admit as Speaker I get an
 
00:35:48.650 --> 00:35:48.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:51.470 --> 00:35:51.480 align:start position:0%
this makes us truly a citizen
 
00:35:53.870 --> 00:35:53.880 align:start position:0%
legislature that salary was put in
 
00:35:57.770 --> 00:35:57.780 align:start position:0%
existence back in I think was 1888 and
 
00:36:00.170 --> 00:36:00.180 align:start position:0%
we still get the same amount of money
 
00:36:02.390 --> 00:36:02.400 align:start position:0%
we do not get a per diem as many other
 
00:36:05.990 --> 00:36:06.000 align:start position:0%
states do or uh any kind of a uh you
 
00:36:08.650 --> 00:36:08.660 align:start position:0%
know a daily uh sum of money
 
00:36:12.349 --> 00:36:12.359 align:start position:0%
so we truly do get one hundred dollars a
 
00:36:12.359 --> 00:36:14.329 align:start position:0%
so we truly do get one hundred dollars a
year

00:36:14.329 --> 00:36:14.339 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:36:17.089 --> 00:36:17.099 align:start position:0%
you're also sitting in the chamber
 
00:36:19.790 --> 00:36:19.800 align:start position:0%
that was first started being used back
 
00:36:21.970 --> 00:36:21.980 align:start position:0%
in 18
 
00:36:21.980 --> 00:36:23.870 align:start position:0%
in 18
.

00:36:23.870 --> 00:36:23.880 align:start position:0%
.
 
00:36:26.329 --> 00:36:26.339 align:start position:0%
we just had our 200th anniversary a few
 
00:36:30.530 --> 00:36:30.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:32.990 --> 00:36:33.000 align:start position:0%
I know everyone that is a state
 
00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:34.670 align:start position:0%
I know everyone that is a state
representative

00:36:34.670 --> 00:36:34.680 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:36:36.890 --> 00:36:36.900 align:start position:0%
in this state
 
00:36:40.490 --> 00:36:40.500 align:start position:0%
is extremely proud of the fact that we
 
00:36:42.349 --> 00:36:42.359 align:start position:0%
Are Who We Are
 
00:36:44.870 --> 00:36:44.880 align:start position:0%
in how much time each representative
 
00:36:47.329 --> 00:36:47.339 align:start position:0%
puts in to try and make New Hampshire a
 
00:36:48.890 --> 00:36:48.900 align:start position:0%
better place
 
00:36:51.770 --> 00:36:51.780 align:start position:0%
and so you'll also notice
 
00:36:54.470 --> 00:36:54.480 align:start position:0%
the state senators which are 24 which is
 
00:36:57.589 --> 00:36:57.599 align:start position:0%
one of the lowest uh bodies of state
 
00:37:01.010 --> 00:37:01.020 align:start position:0%
senators they also get 100 bucks a year
 
00:37:04.069 --> 00:37:04.079 align:start position:0%
they don't get anything more than we do
 
00:37:07.190 --> 00:37:07.200 align:start position:0%
so we do have a unique state it works
 
00:37:09.770 --> 00:37:09.780 align:start position:0%
and I believe we live in the best state
 
00:37:12.410 --> 00:37:12.420 align:start position:0%
in the Union by far
 
00:37:15.050 --> 00:37:15.060 align:start position:0%
and I know all of us will continue to
 
00:37:17.630 --> 00:37:17.640 align:start position:0%
make sure that we continue to be the
 
00:37:20.270 --> 00:37:20.280 align:start position:0%
best state in the Union and I know we
 
00:37:21.950 --> 00:37:21.960 align:start position:0%
will succeed in that
 
00:37:24.970 --> 00:37:24.980 align:start position:0%
uh now I'd like to introduce um
 
00:37:27.230 --> 00:37:27.240 align:start position:0%

in a new governor with Hayden that in
 
00:48:50.870 --> 00:48:50.880 align:start position:0%
itself is very exciting
 
00:48:52.790 --> 00:48:52.800 align:start position:0%
um you're not in class that's kind of
 
00:48:52.800 --> 00:48:54.170 align:start position:0%

the time you get back to class it'll be
 
00:49:02.390 --> 00:49:02.400 align:start position:0%
too late to get any homework tonight so
 
00:49:04.790 --> 00:49:04.800 align:start position:0%
that's the other piece of good news
 
00:49:06.170 --> 00:49:06.180 align:start position:0%
nothing like the governor telling kids
 
00:49:07.910 --> 00:49:07.920 align:start position:0%
they don't need homework
 
00:49:09.410 --> 00:49:09.420 align:start position:0%
um well hey this is absolutely great I
 
00:49:11.210 --> 00:49:11.220 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna do my best not to go on too
 
00:49:12.349 --> 00:49:12.359 align:start position:0%
too long
 
00:49:14.150 --> 00:49:14.160 align:start position:0%
um but first obviously a huge
 
00:49:15.770 --> 00:49:15.780 align:start position:0%
congratulations to Hayden and a big
 
00:49:17.450 --> 00:49:17.460 align:start position:0%
thank you to Charlotte uh with with
 
00:49:19.010 --> 00:49:19.020 align:start position:0%
these delays that we've had because it's
 
00:49:21.290 --> 00:49:21.300 align:start position:0%
been extended a few weeks uh Charlotte
 
00:49:22.790 --> 00:49:22.800 align:start position:0%
you may be the longest serving Governor
 
00:49:24.230 --> 00:49:24.240 align:start position:0%
uh kid Governor we'll see we'll see
 
00:49:25.790 --> 00:49:25.800 align:start position:0%
actually what happens
 
00:49:27.109 --> 00:49:27.119 align:start position:0%
um I don't want to repeat too much of
 
00:49:29.089 --> 00:49:29.099 align:start position:0%
what was said because these folks the
 
00:49:30.410 --> 00:49:30.420 align:start position:0%
fact that you have the Chief Justice and
 
00:49:31.790 --> 00:49:31.800 align:start position:0%
the Secretary of State and someone from
 
00:49:33.230 --> 00:49:33.240 align:start position:0%
the Janet from the executive Council and
 
00:49:34.130 --> 00:49:34.140 align:start position:0%
the speaker of the house and the
 
00:49:36.470 --> 00:49:36.480 align:start position:0%
Senators and this really rarely rarely
 
00:49:38.450 --> 00:49:38.460 align:start position:0%
happens that all these folks would be in
 
00:49:40.670 --> 00:49:40.680 align:start position:0%
this room so it really does signify I
 
00:49:42.589 --> 00:49:42.599 align:start position:0%
think how important that those of us
 
00:49:44.750 --> 00:49:44.760 align:start position:0%
here already within the state house uh
 
00:49:47.450 --> 00:49:47.460 align:start position:0%
see this this opportunity
 
00:49:49.309 --> 00:49:49.319 align:start position:0%
um as the speaker we're saying we have a
 
00:49:52.250 --> 00:49:52.260 align:start position:0%
a citizen government we really do unlike
 
00:49:53.750 --> 00:49:53.760 align:start position:0%
any other state that's Governor I travel
 
00:49:55.609 --> 00:49:55.619 align:start position:0%
all across the country I talk to other
 
00:49:57.349 --> 00:49:57.359 align:start position:0%
Governors and I'm not kidding when I
 
00:49:59.630 --> 00:49:59.640 align:start position:0%
tell you they go how do you do it they
 
00:50:01.069 --> 00:50:01.079 align:start position:0%
see our system and they don't understand
 
00:50:03.290 --> 00:50:03.300 align:start position:0%
how we do it in New Hampshire we're so
 
00:50:05.030 --> 00:50:05.040 align:start position:0%
unique we're not like any other state
 
00:50:07.609 --> 00:50:07.619 align:start position:0%
the fact we have 400 Representatives you
 
00:50:09.589 --> 00:50:09.599 align:start position:0%
can be 18 years old doesn't matter how
 
00:50:11.809 --> 00:50:11.819 align:start position:0%
much money you have or your name ID or
 
00:50:13.670 --> 00:50:13.680 align:start position:0%
anything anybody who wants to get up and
 
00:50:15.950 --> 00:50:15.960 align:start position:0%
serve can serve and you can do that in
 
00:50:17.270 --> 00:50:17.280 align:start position:0%
as the House of Representatives right
 
00:50:20.030 --> 00:50:20.040 align:start position:0%
you can go I don't know I met an 18 year
 
00:50:22.550 --> 00:50:22.560 align:start position:0%
old girl she spent 20 she worked her job
 
00:50:25.130 --> 00:50:25.140 align:start position:0%
she spent 25 bucks she made a bunch of
 
00:50:27.470 --> 00:50:27.480 align:start position:0%
posters at Kinkos and she knocked on
 
00:50:30.829 --> 00:50:30.839 align:start position:0%
about the 2 000 doors a few times over a
 
00:50:32.630 --> 00:50:32.640 align:start position:0%
few months and introduced herself and
 
00:50:35.329 --> 00:50:35.339 align:start position:0%
she won that's it that's it she won she
 
00:50:36.470 --> 00:50:36.480 align:start position:0%
just knocked on doors and talked to as
 
00:50:38.030 --> 00:50:38.040 align:start position:0%
many people as possible and now she's
 
00:50:39.170 --> 00:50:39.180 align:start position:0%
here in the House of Representatives
 
00:50:40.849 --> 00:50:40.859 align:start position:0%
which is just an amazing opportunity
 
00:50:42.710 --> 00:50:42.720 align:start position:0%
Most states you can't do that and
 
00:50:43.849 --> 00:50:43.859 align:start position:0%
whether it's serving in the House of
 
00:50:45.109 --> 00:50:45.119 align:start position:0%
Representatives or in the senate or
 
00:50:46.910 --> 00:50:46.920 align:start position:0%
running for office or the planning board
 
00:50:49.130 --> 00:50:49.140 align:start position:0%
or the school board or donating time at
 
00:50:52.130 --> 00:50:52.140 align:start position:0%
the non-profit or giving something of
 
00:50:53.870 --> 00:50:53.880 align:start position:0%
yourself that's the true difference in
 
00:50:54.890 --> 00:50:54.900 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire no matter whether you're
 
00:50:57.530 --> 00:50:57.540 align:start position:0%
elected or not all 1.4 million of us we
 
00:51:00.109 --> 00:51:00.119 align:start position:0%
have a responsibility give back somehow
 
00:51:02.809 --> 00:51:02.819 align:start position:0%
find your thing right find what you
 
00:51:04.849 --> 00:51:04.859 align:start position:0%
enjoy doing find what your your special
 
00:51:06.349 --> 00:51:06.359 align:start position:0%
talent is because everyone has one
 
00:51:07.790 --> 00:51:07.800 align:start position:0%
sometimes we got to dig a little to find
 
00:51:09.109 --> 00:51:09.119 align:start position:0%
it I had to figure out what mine was
 
00:51:10.670 --> 00:51:10.680 align:start position:0%
took me like forever to figure it out
 
00:51:13.430 --> 00:51:13.440 align:start position:0%
but find a way to give back and
 
00:51:14.809 --> 00:51:14.819 align:start position:0%
sometimes it's just giving a little bit
 
00:51:17.150 --> 00:51:17.160 align:start position:0%
of your time to your community and we do
 
00:51:19.849 --> 00:51:19.859 align:start position:0%
that really really well here the
 
00:51:21.589 --> 00:51:21.599 align:start position:0%
solutions are not just up here in
 
00:51:23.510 --> 00:51:23.520 align:start position:0%
Concord the solutions are in your
 
00:51:25.490 --> 00:51:25.500 align:start position:0%
schools or at your town meeting and town

um with the school boards or the uh the
 
00:51:33.829 --> 00:51:33.839 align:start position:0%
non-profits that do so much work in your
 
00:51:36.170 --> 00:51:36.180 align:start position:0%
community so find a way to give back uh
 
00:51:37.430 --> 00:51:37.440 align:start position:0%
through that process and the fact that
 
00:51:38.630 --> 00:51:38.640 align:start position:0%
you're here means you guys are already
 
00:51:40.609 --> 00:51:40.619 align:start position:0%
on track and that what we want to do is
 
00:51:42.049 --> 00:51:42.059 align:start position:0%
is spread this message as much as
 
00:51:43.430 --> 00:51:43.440 align:start position:0%
possible so
 
00:51:44.930 --> 00:51:44.940 align:start position:0%
um from kids to grandparents everybody
 
00:51:46.849 --> 00:51:46.859 align:start position:0%

00:52:54.170 --> 00:52:54.180 align:start position:0%
year it really is an obligation and an
 
00:52:56.089 --> 00:52:56.099 align:start position:0%
opportunity to go around and share this
 
00:52:58.730 --> 00:52:58.740 align:start position:0%
this um this the the initials whether
 
00:53:00.470 --> 00:53:00.480 align:start position:0%
it's around homelessness or just hear
 
00:53:02.270 --> 00:53:02.280 align:start position:0%
from you guys right you're the peer
 
00:53:04.069 --> 00:53:04.079 align:start position:0%
group and so you get to talk to this
 
00:53:06.170 --> 00:53:06.180 align:start position:0%
this kid governor and say this is what
 
00:53:07.370 --> 00:53:07.380 align:start position:0%
we should be talking about at the state
 
00:53:09.170 --> 00:53:09.180 align:start position:0%
level and don't forget about this issue
 
00:53:10.549 --> 00:53:10.559 align:start position:0%
and this is a new thing that we want to
 
00:53:12.230 --> 00:53:12.240 align:start position:0%
and it could be anything right it could
 
00:53:13.430 --> 00:53:13.440 align:start position:0%
be on animals it could be on the
 
00:53:15.109 --> 00:53:15.119 align:start position:0%
homeless issue it could be on you know
 
00:53:17.690 --> 00:53:17.700 align:start position:0%
our drug and opioid crisis and mental
 
00:53:19.069 --> 00:53:19.079 align:start position:0%
health issues it could be on so many
 
00:53:20.510 --> 00:53:20.520 align:start position:0%
different things because there's so much
 
00:53:22.549 --> 00:53:22.559 align:start position:0%
so much work to be done but Valerie was
 
00:53:23.870 --> 00:53:23.880 align:start position:0%
the one that really I think understood
 
00:53:25.970 --> 00:53:25.980 align:start position:0%
this as a former school teacher and as a
 
00:53:28.849 --> 00:53:28.859 align:start position:0%
mom I really understood the power that
 
00:53:31.370 --> 00:53:31.380 align:start position:0%
this program was having so in that she
 
00:53:33.589 --> 00:53:33.599 align:start position:0%
wrote a letter and she said if you don't
 
00:53:35.329 --> 00:53:35.339 align:start position:0%
read this letter word for word don't
 
00:53:37.370 --> 00:53:37.380 align:start position:0%
bother coming home
 
00:53:39.049 --> 00:53:39.059 align:start position:0%
because she will find out about it she's
 
00:53:40.670 --> 00:53:40.680 align:start position:0%
going to get texts if I don't hit it on
 
00:53:43.549 --> 00:53:43.559 align:start position:0%
on the butt button so let me this is a
 
00:53:46.190 --> 00:53:46.200 align:start position:0%
letter from the first lady dear kid
 
00:53:49.549 --> 00:53:49.559 align:start position:0%
governor of New Hampshire 2023 Hayden
 
00:53:52.849 --> 00:53:52.859 align:start position:0%

00:54:00.109 --> 00:54:00.119 align:start position:0%
first lady or some prefers to say some
 
00:54:01.970 --> 00:54:01.980 align:start position:0%
prefer to say first spouse of the State
 
00:54:03.770 --> 00:54:03.780 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire I wasn't elected to
 
00:54:05.150 --> 00:54:05.160 align:start position:0%
this position but because my husband
 
00:54:07.370 --> 00:54:07.380 align:start position:0%
Chris is Governor I'm able to shine a
 
00:54:08.930 --> 00:54:08.940 align:start position:0%
light on some amazing opportunities and
 
00:54:10.730 --> 00:54:10.740 align:start position:0%
people in the granite state just like
 
00:54:10.740 --> 00:54:11.510 align:start position:0%

have
 
00:57:56.450 --> 00:57:56.460 align:start position:0%
I realized this was a big Community
 
00:57:58.790 --> 00:57:58.800 align:start position:0%
issue during the pandemic I heard about
 
00:58:01.010 --> 00:58:01.020 align:start position:0%
people who couldn't afford food water
 
00:58:03.349 --> 00:58:03.359 align:start position:0%
rent clothes or other important
 
00:58:05.349 --> 00:58:05.359 align:start position:0%
Necessities once the opportunity
 
00:58:07.549 --> 00:58:07.559 align:start position:0%
opportunity to run for New Hampshire get
 
00:58:09.890 --> 00:58:09.900 align:start position:0%
Governor presented itself I started to
 
00:58:11.569 --> 00:58:11.579 align:start position:0%
research poverty and hunger in our state
 
00:58:13.490 --> 00:58:13.500 align:start position:0%
once I looked at the charts I knew I
 
00:58:15.230 --> 00:58:15.240 align:start position:0%
needed to run for New Hampshire Governor
 
00:58:17.089 --> 00:58:17.099 align:start position:0%
I needed to make positive change in our
 
00:58:17.099 --> 00:58:18.170 align:start position:0%
I needed to make positive change in our
state

00:58:18.170 --> 00:58:18.180 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:58:20.270 --> 00:58:20.280 align:start position:0%
I read on the feeding America website
 
00:58:22.490 --> 00:58:22.500 align:start position:0%
that one out of 14 people suffer from
 
00:58:25.250 --> 00:58:25.260 align:start position:0%
hunger every day and one out of 11 of
 
00:58:26.809 --> 00:58:26.819 align:start position:0%
them are children that's just in the
 
00:58:29.150 --> 00:58:29.160 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire I also read that
 
00:58:32.750 --> 00:58:32.760 align:start position:0%
7.6 of New Hampshire's population suffer
 
00:58:34.609 --> 00:58:34.619 align:start position:0%
from poverty every day
 
00:58:36.710 --> 00:58:36.720 align:start position:0%
there are many wonderful programs out
 
00:58:39.410 --> 00:58:39.420 align:start position:0%
there for example Governor sununa's SNAP
 
00:58:40.970 --> 00:58:40.980 align:start position:0%
program which provides nutrition
 
00:58:43.130 --> 00:58:43.140 align:start position:0%
benefits for low-income individuals and
 
00:58:45.470 --> 00:58:45.480 align:start position:0%
families but these programs are still
 
00:58:46.849 --> 00:58:46.859 align:start position:0%
not enough
 
00:58:49.010 --> 00:58:49.020 align:start position:0%
sometimes when you get hungry or cold
 
00:58:51.289 --> 00:58:51.299 align:start position:0%
you might say I'm starving or I'm
 
00:58:53.690 --> 00:58:53.700 align:start position:0%
freezing imagine not having enough food
 
00:58:55.490 --> 00:58:55.500 align:start position:0%
in your fridge to be able to go and get
 
00:58:57.049 --> 00:58:57.059 align:start position:0%
a snack or even a meal whenever you
 
00:58:59.150 --> 00:58:59.160 align:start position:0%
needed to imagine not having enough heat
 
00:59:00.710 --> 00:59:00.720 align:start position:0%
in your home to be able to go inside and
 
00:59:02.630 --> 00:59:02.640 align:start position:0%
get warm that's what it really feels
 
00:59:04.370 --> 00:59:04.380 align:start position:0%
like to be starving and that's what it
 
00:59:07.690 --> 00:59:07.700 align:start position:0%
really feels like to be freezing
 
00:59:13.309 --> 00:59:13.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:14.930 --> 00:59:14.940 align:start position:0%
you might be wondering how you can help
 
00:59:16.910 --> 00:59:16.920 align:start position:0%
you can help by donating encouraging
 
00:59:19.010 --> 00:59:19.020 align:start position:0%
others to donate educating yourself and
 
00:59:21.470 --> 00:59:21.480 align:start position:0%
