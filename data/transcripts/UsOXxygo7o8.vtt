00:25:27.310 --> 00:25:27.320 align:start position:0%

Speaker

00:25:30.310 --> 00:25:30.320 align:start position:0%
Speaker
 
00:25:33.230 --> 00:25:33.240 align:start position:0%
first a little background about this
 
00:25:37.590 --> 00:25:37.600 align:start position:0%
bill currently state law allows entry
 
00:25:40.510 --> 00:25:40.520 align:start position:0%
for the parts of property outside the
 
00:25:43.269 --> 00:25:43.279 align:start position:0%
immediate area of a home
 
00:25:47.389 --> 00:25:47.399 align:start position:0%
itself the idea behind this longstanding
 
00:25:51.990 --> 00:25:52.000 align:start position:0%
allowance is called the Open Fields
 
00:25:54.470 --> 00:25:54.480 align:start position:0%
Doctrine which says there is no
 
00:25:58.870 --> 00:25:58.880 align:start position:0%
expectation of privacy in an open field
 
00:26:01.110 --> 00:26:01.120 align:start position:0%
this exception has been in the law for
 
00:26:01.120 --> 00:26:02.029 align:start position:0%
this exception has been in the law for
100

00:26:02.029 --> 00:26:02.039 align:start position:0%
100
 
00:26:04.510 --> 00:26:04.520 align:start position:0%
years the minority feels that there is
 
00:26:09.430 --> 00:26:09.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:11.909 --> 00:26:11.919 align:start position:0%
practice no single property owner
 
00:26:14.310 --> 00:26:14.320 align:start position:0%
testified about a need for this
 
00:26:16.830 --> 00:26:16.840 align:start position:0%
bill we heard testimony from the chief
 
00:26:18.870 --> 00:26:18.880 align:start position:0%
of police of the town of Ry who told us
 
00:26:21.230 --> 00:26:21.240 align:start position:0%
that whenever officers see a sign for no
 
00:26:23.750 --> 00:26:23.760 align:start position:0%
trespassing on the
 
00:26:26.430 --> 00:26:26.440 align:start position:0%
property they have reason to enter there
 
00:26:30.110 --> 00:26:30.120 align:start position:0%
is they allain to always get a
 
00:26:32.310 --> 00:26:32.320 align:start position:0%
warrant they are also taught that the
 
00:26:34.990 --> 00:26:35.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Supreme Court has gone so
 
00:26:37.909 --> 00:26:37.919 align:start position:0%
far as to say if there is time to get a
 
00:26:41.470 --> 00:26:41.480 align:start position:0%
warrant it is the only safe way to
 
00:26:44.269 --> 00:26:44.279 align:start position:0%
proceed he said this bill is not needed
 
00:26:45.950 --> 00:26:45.960 align:start position:0%
and the minority
 
00:26:49.350 --> 00:26:49.360 align:start position:0%
agrees the bottom line is this bill is a
 
00:26:53.549 --> 00:26:53.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:56.750 --> 00:26:56.760 align:start position:0%
problem it is important to
 
00:26:58.789 --> 00:26:58.799 align:start position:0%
note that
 
00:27:03.149 --> 00:27:03.159 align:start position:0%
in the public hearing we heard one thing
 
00:27:06.029 --> 00:27:06.039 align:start position:0%
but the P but the bill says something
 
00:27:07.310 --> 00:27:07.320 align:start position:0%
that is
 
00:27:09.950 --> 00:27:09.960 align:start position:0%
different the testimony indicated that
 
00:27:13.389 --> 00:27:13.399 align:start position:0%
land subject to open to the Open Fields
 
00:27:16.389 --> 00:27:16.399 align:start position:0%
Doctrine now needs the consent of of a
 
00:27:20.230 --> 00:27:20.240 align:start position:0%
warrant but only if it is for secured
 
00:27:22.870 --> 00:27:22.880 align:start position:0%
property which means land posted with no
 
00:27:22.880 --> 00:27:25.470 align:start position:0%
property which means land posted with no
trespassing

00:27:25.470 --> 00:27:25.480 align:start position:0%
trespassing
 
00:27:28.230 --> 00:27:28.240 align:start position:0%
signs one section of that of the build
 
00:27:32.070 --> 00:27:32.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:34.230 --> 00:27:34.240 align:start position:0%
requirement however the bill goes well
 
00:27:35.990 --> 00:27:36.000 align:start position:0%
beyond that
 
00:27:39.750 --> 00:27:39.760 align:start position:0%
point the next two sections of the bill
 
00:27:42.110 --> 00:27:42.120 align:start position:0%
require that consent must be gained or a
 
00:27:45.149 --> 00:27:45.159 align:start position:0%
warrant must be shown to the owner of
 
00:27:49.230 --> 00:27:49.240 align:start position:0%
private land now private land is not
 
00:27:54.590 --> 00:27:54.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:59.310 --> 00:27:59.320 align:start position:0%
bill nothing in the bill requires
 
00:28:02.669 --> 00:28:02.679 align:start position:0%
government agents to get consent for a
 
00:28:06.389 --> 00:28:06.399 align:start position:0%
warrant or for a non-private land and
 
00:28:09.950 --> 00:28:09.960 align:start position:0%
this bill just as aide only applies to
 
00:28:12.269 --> 00:28:12.279 align:start position:0%
government agent it's it does not apply
 
00:28:14.350 --> 00:28:14.360 align:start position:0%
to ordinary citizens this only applies
 
00:28:19.990 --> 00:28:20.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:24.230 --> 00:28:24.240 align:start position:0%
agents the next two sections of the bill
 
00:28:26.350 --> 00:28:26.360 align:start position:0%
so it so it now requires for private
 
00:28:30.149 --> 00:28:30.159 align:start position:0%
land that you get a a warrant warrant or
 
00:28:32.950 --> 00:28:32.960 align:start position:0%
consent this completely rejects the open
 
00:28:35.909 --> 00:28:35.919 align:start position:0%
field doctrine that I mentioned and
 
00:28:38.509 --> 00:28:38.519 align:start position:0%
expands the reach of this bill to 3.3
 
00:28:40.870 --> 00:28:40.880 align:start position:0%
million acres of non-post
 
00:28:45.149 --> 00:28:45.159 align:start position:0%
land which is 91% of the land in New
 
00:28:47.750 --> 00:28:47.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire this is a massive change that
 
00:28:50.029 --> 00:28:50.039 align:start position:0%
needs further
 
00:28:52.830 --> 00:28:52.840 align:start position:0%
discussion also the definition of
 
00:28:54.870 --> 00:28:54.880 align:start position:0%
government agent in this bill requires
 
00:28:57.549 --> 00:28:57.559 align:start position:0%
that any local estate official who is
 
00:28:59.190 --> 00:28:59.200 align:start position:0%
employed are contracted by the
 
00:29:05.350 --> 00:29:05.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:08.549 --> 00:29:08.559 align:start position:0%
bill we need to change that definition
 
00:29:10.909 --> 00:29:10.919 align:start position:0%
so that it only affects Lo inprivate
 
00:29:14.789 --> 00:29:14.799 align:start position:0%
land like the need to enforce
 
00:29:18.070 --> 00:29:18.080 align:start position:0%
laws about off-highway recreational
 
00:29:21.549 --> 00:29:21.559 align:start position:0%
vehicles that need need to be enforced
 
00:29:23.630 --> 00:29:23.640 align:start position:0%
the bottom line is that the this bill
 
00:29:26.470 --> 00:29:26.480 align:start position:0%
needs more far more scrutiny than it is
 
00:29:29.430 --> 00:29:29.440 align:start position:0%
received to date so please press the red
 
00:29:32.509 --> 00:29:32.519 align:start position:0%

00:32:22.350 --> 00:32:22.360 align:start position:0%
Speaker if I know that the bill attempts
 
00:32:24.669 --> 00:32:24.679 align:start position:0%
to solve a problem that doesn't exist
 
00:32:27.990 --> 00:32:28.000 align:start position:0%
and that no uh property owner showed up
 
00:32:31.190 --> 00:32:31.200 align:start position:0%
in favor of it and if I know the Bill
 
00:32:33.430 --> 00:32:33.440 align:start position:0%
runs counter to a long-standing US
 
00:32:35.870 --> 00:32:35.880 align:start position:0%

Open Fields Doctrine and finally if I
 
00:32:49.070 --> 00:32:49.080 align:start position:0%
know that the drafter of the bill is an

Speaker with this bill would do is end
 
00:36:08.349 --> 00:36:08.359 align:start position:0%
our state's current prohibition on

people 18 and over from carrying or
 
00:36:13.190 --> 00:36:13.200 align:start position:0%
possessing with intent to sell street

fighting weapons these weapons include
 
00:36:18.910 --> 00:36:18.920 align:start position:0%
blackjacks breast Knuckles and something
 
00:36:22.550 --> 00:36:22.560 align:start position:0%
called a slungshot the prohibition under
 
00:36:24.870 --> 00:36:24.880 align:start position:0%
the bill would continue for miners under
 
00:36:26.069 --> 00:36:26.079 align:start position:0%
the age of
 
00:36:28.750 --> 00:36:28.760 align:start position:0%
18 currently carrying or possessing
 
00:36:30.270 --> 00:36:30.280 align:start position:0%
these weapons is a misdemeanor in the
 
00:36:33.109 --> 00:36:33.119 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire the injuries
 
00:36:35.030 --> 00:36:35.040 align:start position:0%
these weapons cause can be
 
00:36:37.589 --> 00:36:37.599 align:start position:0%
devastating in addition to inflicting
 
00:36:39.990 --> 00:36:40.000 align:start position:0%
concussions and brain damage they can
 
00:36:43.230 --> 00:36:43.240 align:start position:0%
fracture skulls break bones destroy
 
00:36:45.589 --> 00:36:45.599 align:start position:0%
teeth and cause wounds that require
 
00:36:47.829 --> 00:36:47.839 align:start position:0%
dozens of stitches and plastic surgery
 
00:36:51.349 --> 00:36:51.359 align:start position:0%
to fix if they can be fixed at
 
00:36:53.950 --> 00:36:53.960 align:start position:0%
all unlike previous public hearings
 
00:36:55.550 --> 00:36:55.560 align:start position:0%
where these weapons were framed as
 
00:36:58.910 --> 00:36:58.920 align:start position:0%
Antiquated weapons that belong in Museum
 
00:37:01.430 --> 00:37:01.440 align:start position:0%
this time we didn't hear the Antiques
 
00:37:04.589 --> 00:37:04.599 align:start position:0%
Road Show argument instead we heard that
 
00:37:06.870 --> 00:37:06.880 align:start position:0%
the weapons of choice for street gangs
 
00:37:09.990 --> 00:37:10.000 align:start position:0%
and lone sharks are actually weapons now
 
00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:11.510 align:start position:0%
and lone sharks are actually weapons now
for

00:37:11.510 --> 00:37:11.520 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:37:14.390 --> 00:37:14.400 align:start position:0%
self-defense well as hard as I tried and
 
00:37:17.030 --> 00:37:17.040 align:start position:0%
as long as I searched online one of the
 
00:37:19.150 --> 00:37:19.160 align:start position:0%
things that I couldn't find as a single
 
00:37:21.990 --> 00:37:22.000 align:start position:0%
example of these weapons actually being
 
00:37:23.109 --> 00:37:23.119 align:start position:0%
used for
 
00:37:25.710 --> 00:37:25.720 align:start position:0%
self-defense but when I looked for brass
 
00:37:27.510 --> 00:37:27.520 align:start position:0%
knuckle attacks and assaults and
 
00:37:30.750 --> 00:37:30.760 align:start position:0%
searched on terms like that I got back
 
00:37:33.790 --> 00:37:33.800 align:start position:0%
1, 160,000
 
00:37:36.470 --> 00:37:36.480 align:start position:0%
results the bottom line is if we if we
 
00:37:37.950 --> 00:37:37.960 align:start position:0%
remove this
 
00:37:40.790 --> 00:37:40.800 align:start position:0%
prohibition um we'll be doing a lot more
 
00:37:42.630 --> 00:37:42.640 align:start position:0%
than making these weapons available to
 
00:37:42.640 --> 00:37:43.589 align:start position:0%
than making these weapons available to
average

00:37:43.589 --> 00:37:43.599 align:start position:0%
average
 
00:37:46.309 --> 00:37:46.319 align:start position:0%
citizens we're also going to be making
 
00:37:49.750 --> 00:37:49.760 align:start position:0%
them available to some of our below
 
00:37:52.349 --> 00:37:52.359 align:start position:0%
average citizens who are criminals and
 
00:37:54.910 --> 00:37:54.920 align:start position:0%
Thugs who can and will use them for what
 
00:37:57.670 --> 00:37:57.680 align:start position:0%
they have always been used for to to
 
00:38:00.270 --> 00:38:00.280 align:start position:0%
intimidate to coerce and to assault
 
00:38:00.280 --> 00:38:01.030 align:start position:0%
intimidate to coerce and to assault
their

00:38:01.030 --> 00:38:01.040 align:start position:0%
their
 
00:38:03.430 --> 00:38:03.440 align:start position:0%
victims as for the fact that this bill
 
00:38:05.790 --> 00:38:05.800 align:start position:0%
retains the prohibition for people under
 
00:38:08.829 --> 00:38:08.839 align:start position:0%
the age of 18 this adds no more
 
00:38:10.710 --> 00:38:10.720 align:start position:0%
protection for kids in our schools
 
00:38:12.950 --> 00:38:12.960 align:start position:0%
because many New Hampshire High Schools
 
00:38:15.270 --> 00:38:15.280 align:start position:0%
including those in some of our largest
 
00:38:17.710 --> 00:38:17.720 align:start position:0%
cities have students who are over the
 
00:38:18.630 --> 00:38:18.640 align:start position:0%
age of
 
00:38:21.950 --> 00:38:21.960 align:start position:0%
18 something else to consider is that if
 
00:38:24.309 --> 00:38:24.319 align:start position:0%
this bill should somehow become law it
 
00:38:26.670 --> 00:38:26.680 align:start position:0%
would create a situation where we'd be
 
00:38:29.630 --> 00:38:29.640 align:start position:0%
prosecuting children for something that
 
00:38:32.190 --> 00:38:32.200 align:start position:0%
is legal for adults to
 
00:38:34.790 --> 00:38:34.800 align:start position:0%
do at a time when we are visually
 
00:38:37.230 --> 00:38:37.240 align:start position:0%
struggling to come up with ways we can
 
00:38:40.150 --> 00:38:40.160 align:start position:0%
agree on that enhance the safety of our
 
00:38:42.950 --> 00:38:42.960 align:start position:0%
communities the one thing we absolutely
 
00:38:45.230 --> 00:38:45.240 align:start position:0%
should not be doing is something that
 
00:38:47.550 --> 00:38:47.560 align:start position:0%
would instantly make our communities our
 
00:38:49.910 --> 00:38:49.920 align:start position:0%
schools our bars and our public
 
00:38:52.870 --> 00:38:52.880 align:start position:0%
gathering places any less safe by
 
00:38:55.710 --> 00:38:55.720 align:start position:0%
rejecting this unneeded bill all of us
 
00:38:57.750 --> 00:38:57.760 align:start position:0%
have a genuine opportunity to to do
 
00:39:00.190 --> 00:39:00.200 align:start position:0%
something very meaningful to protect our
 
00:39:02.950 --> 00:39:02.960 align:start position:0%
constituents against a real threat a
 
00:39:04.790 --> 00:39:04.800 align:start position:0%
threat that if you wave this bill
 
00:39:08.150 --> 00:39:08.160 align:start position:0%

1276 blackjacks slung shots and brass
 
00:39:40.030 --> 00:39:40.040 align:start position:0%
knuckles the fact that most of us do not
 
00:39:41.550 --> 00:39:41.560 align:start position:0%
know what two of these items are tells
 
00:39:44.309 --> 00:39:44.319 align:start position:0%
you how old this ban is today these
 
00:39:46.589 --> 00:39:46.599 align:start position:0%
tools have become more of a novelty an
 
00:39:48.390 --> 00:39:48.400 align:start position:0%
ornament some would hang from the

about how dangerous these Antiquated

are you heard once we make these legal
 
00:40:03.950 --> 00:40:03.960 align:start position:0%
somehow there's going to be a mad rush
 
00:40:06.190 --> 00:40:06.200 align:start position:0%
on your local slungshot store and

things and bring them to school if that
 
00:40:14.109 --> 00:40:14.119 align:start position:0%

grounds we also heard in committee how
 
00:40:27.030 --> 00:40:27.040 align:start position:0%
these tools have been used to inflict
 
00:40:29.190 --> 00:40:29.200 align:start position:0%
devast devastating injuries to include
 
00:40:30.670 --> 00:40:30.680 align:start position:0%
orbital socket

walking in my neighborhood or jogging on

our local rail trail it would not
 
00:40:38.430 --> 00:40:38.440 align:start position:0%
concern me if they inflicted an orbital

titled runers urged to be aware of
 
00:40:56.829 --> 00:40:56.839 align:start position:0%
surroundings carry self-defense tools
 
00:40:59.349 --> 00:40:59.359 align:start position:0%
self defense tools just because
 
00:41:01.030 --> 00:41:01.040 align:start position:0%
something could be used as an offensive
 
00:41:02.910 --> 00:41:02.920 align:start position:0%
weapon doesn't mean it should be banned
 
00:41:05.710 --> 00:41:05.720 align:start position:0%
as a defensive option it is important to
 
00:41:07.829 --> 00:41:07.839 align:start position:0%
note that these illegal tools are not
 
00:41:09.589 --> 00:41:09.599 align:start position:0%
banned for law enforcement officers or
 
00:41:11.829 --> 00:41:11.839 align:start position:0%
hunters in my 30 years in law
 
00:41:14.990 --> 00:41:15.000 align:start position:0%
enforcement I have not possessed no I do
 
00:41:16.349 --> 00:41:16.359 align:start position:0%
I know of any other officer who has
 
00:41:18.550 --> 00:41:18.560 align:start position:0%
possessed any of these tools and while
 
00:41:20.349 --> 00:41:20.359 align:start position:0%
I'm not a hunter I've had many
 
00:41:23.190 --> 00:41:23.200 align:start position:0%
interactions with hunters in my career
 
00:41:24.750 --> 00:41:24.760 align:start position:0%
and when I see a deer in the back of
 
00:41:26.510 --> 00:41:26.520 align:start position:0%
their pickup truck or strapped to the
 
00:41:29.390 --> 00:41:29.400 align:start position:0%
hood of their bu Road Master not one
 
00:41:33.950 --> 00:41:33.960 align:start position:0%
deer not one had an orbital socket
 
00:41:36.670 --> 00:41:36.680 align:start position:0%
fracture what is this tell us police
 
00:41:38.230 --> 00:41:38.240 align:start position:0%
officers and Hunters do not carry these
 
00:41:40.230 --> 00:41:40.240 align:start position:0%
things because they have
 
00:41:42.430 --> 00:41:42.440 align:start position:0%
firearms do you know who not who might
 
00:41:45.710 --> 00:41:45.720 align:start position:0%
not have a firearm a female jogger guns
 
00:41:48.349 --> 00:41:48.359 align:start position:0%
are heavy expensive intimidating and
 
00:41:51.270 --> 00:41:51.280 align:start position:0%
require ongoing training and practice
 
00:41:53.589 --> 00:41:53.599 align:start position:0%
but a lightweight discreet pair of brass
 
00:41:55.870 --> 00:41:55.880 align:start position:0%
knuckles that's a perfect defensive tool
 
00:41:58.069 --> 00:41:58.079 align:start position:0%
for a jogger a tool that would be
 
00:42:00.630 --> 00:42:00.640 align:start position:0%
readily available a tool that would be
 
00:42:03.510 --> 00:42:03.520 align:start position:0%
natural to effectively use and a tool
 
00:42:05.390 --> 00:42:05.400 align:start position:0%
that can level the playing field and an
 
00:42:07.750 --> 00:42:07.760 align:start position:0%
attack I would go so far as to call
 
00:42:10.510 --> 00:42:10.520 align:start position:0%
these harm reduction tools for these
 
00:42:12.430 --> 00:42:12.440 align:start position:0%

that I aired perhaps having corn beef

and cabbage on the mind and would
 
00:52:00.510 --> 00:52:00.520 align:start position:0%
instead now ask the body to vote red

that New Hampshire's University and Co

Community College systems are very aware
 
00:52:21.270 --> 00:52:21.280 align:start position:0%
of student loan debt crisis and if I
 
00:52:23.069 --> 00:52:23.079 align:start position:0%
know that they meet regularly to
 
00:52:25.710 --> 00:52:25.720 align:start position:0%
determine ways to reduce costs such as
 
00:52:27.750 --> 00:52:27.760 align:start position:0%
coordinating purch interesting practices
 
00:52:29.670 --> 00:52:29.680 align:start position:0%
as well as allowing automatic student
 
00:52:31.589 --> 00:52:31.599 align:start position:0%
matriculation from a community college
 
00:52:34.950 --> 00:52:34.960 align:start position:0%
to a university and finally if I know
 
00:52:36.910 --> 00:52:36.920 align:start position:0%
that establishing a committee to study
 
00:52:39.309 --> 00:52:39.319 align:start position:0%
the role of colleges and universities in
 
00:52:41.430 --> 00:52:41.440 align:start position:0%
contributing to the student loan crisis
 
00:52:43.750 --> 00:52:43.760 align:start position:0%
is completely unnecessary as it is

leas prior to the anti-discrimination
 
00:54:51.309 --> 00:54:51.319 align:start position:0%
law that this bill tries to
 
00:54:54.750 --> 00:54:54.760 align:start position:0%
repeal many of us including people in
 
00:54:57.670 --> 00:54:57.680 align:start position:0%
this room right now have had our kids
 
00:55:01.789 --> 00:55:01.799 align:start position:0%
and our friends kids come home upset
 
00:55:03.910 --> 00:55:03.920 align:start position:0%
because they were being taught that all
 
00:55:08.109 --> 00:55:08.119 align:start position:0%
white people are racist and that because
 
00:55:10.990 --> 00:55:11.000 align:start position:0%
they were a boy they were
 
00:55:16.069 --> 00:55:16.079 align:start position:0%
oppressors um since this law was passed
 
00:55:19.030 --> 00:55:19.040 align:start position:0%
I haven't heard any of that so I would
 
00:55:21.230 --> 00:55:21.240 align:start position:0%
say it seems to be working and there's
 
00:55:23.309 --> 00:55:23.319 align:start position:0%
no reason to repeal
 
00:55:28.670 --> 00:55:28.680 align:start position:0%
it but schools businesses have started
 
00:55:34.789 --> 00:55:34.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:37.069 --> 00:55:37.079 align:start position:0%
discriminatory they started a new
 
00:55:40.470 --> 00:55:40.480 align:start position:0%
Campaign which is more subtle but just
 
00:55:43.150 --> 00:55:43.160 align:start position:0%
as pernicious and I'd like to read a
 
00:55:46.549 --> 00:55:46.559 align:start position:0%
letter that our committee got from a
 
00:55:51.029 --> 00:55:51.039 align:start position:0%
person of color on what is currently
 
00:55:55.230 --> 00:55:55.240 align:start position:0%
being pushed which is racist and
 
00:55:57.750 --> 00:55:57.760 align:start position:0%
discriminatory I would like to address
 
00:55:59.950 --> 00:55:59.960 align:start position:0%
the committee on the inclusion of
 
00:56:02.910 --> 00:56:02.920 align:start position:0%
diversity equity and inclusion policies
 
00:56:06.470 --> 00:56:06.480 align:start position:0%
within our state being a person of color
 
00:56:08.910 --> 00:56:08.920 align:start position:0%
it is my experience that Dei should
 
00:56:12.270 --> 00:56:12.280 align:start position:0%
instead be labeled division exclusion
 
00:56:12.280 --> 00:56:13.750 align:start position:0%
instead be labeled division exclusion
and

00:56:13.750 --> 00:56:13.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:56:16.029 --> 00:56:16.039 align:start position:0%
indoctrination instead of judging people
 
00:56:18.349 --> 00:56:18.359 align:start position:0%
by their character as Martin Luther King
 
00:56:21.710 --> 00:56:21.720 align:start position:0%
aspired to these policies aim at disc
 
00:56:24.349 --> 00:56:24.359 align:start position:0%
discriminating against races that happen
 
00:56:27.270 --> 00:56:27.280 align:start position:0%
to be out of favor at this time
 
00:56:29.270 --> 00:56:29.280 align:start position:0%
just as we look back on History right
 
00:56:31.910 --> 00:56:31.920 align:start position:0%
now and bow our heads in shame at how
 
00:56:34.349 --> 00:56:34.359 align:start position:0%
blacks were once treated today's
 
00:56:36.470 --> 00:56:36.480 align:start position:0%
generation seems bent on creating
 
00:56:39.109 --> 00:56:39.119 align:start position:0%
another Injustice that it will have to
 
00:56:41.829 --> 00:56:41.839 align:start position:0%
repent of in future Generations by
 
00:56:44.670 --> 00:56:44.680 align:start position:0%
choosing favored skin colors and
 
00:56:47.630 --> 00:56:47.640 align:start position:0%
endowing certain levels of melatonin
 
00:56:50.630 --> 00:56:50.640 align:start position:0%
with rights that are denied
 
00:56:55.230 --> 00:56:55.240 align:start position:0%
others the efforts of Dei policies to
 
00:56:58.750 --> 00:56:58.760 align:start position:0%
help peoples of color contrary to their
 
00:57:01.710 --> 00:57:01.720 align:start position:0%
stated purpose of lifting us up are
 
00:57:06.190 --> 00:57:06.200 align:start position:0%
placing boots on our necks what legy is
 
00:57:09.870 --> 00:57:09.880 align:start position:0%
being left by Dei policies as I listen
 
00:57:12.630 --> 00:57:12.640 align:start position:0%
to whites tell me all the things that
 
00:57:15.309 --> 00:57:15.319 align:start position:0%
need to be done to make my life equal to
 
00:57:18.589 --> 00:57:18.599 align:start position:0%
their own I hear the ideologies behind
 
00:57:21.589 --> 00:57:21.599 align:start position:0%
their words I hear them telling me that
 
00:57:24.589 --> 00:57:24.599 align:start position:0%
people or color are an inferior race
 
00:57:27.029 --> 00:57:27.039 align:start position:0%
that is incapable of rising to the
 
00:57:30.349 --> 00:57:30.359 align:start position:0%
challenges handed them at this hour I
 
00:57:32.990 --> 00:57:33.000 align:start position:0%
hear them telling me that the only way
 
00:57:35.270 --> 00:57:35.280 align:start position:0%
that our people can be successful in
 
00:57:38.950 --> 00:57:38.960 align:start position:0%
life is if other races cheat at life for
 
00:57:42.190 --> 00:57:42.200 align:start position:0%
us by giving us a head start I hear them
 
00:57:44.829 --> 00:57:44.839 align:start position:0%
saying there is no value in my people
 
00:57:47.190 --> 00:57:47.200 align:start position:0%
except the value endowed by their great
 
00:57:47.200 --> 00:57:48.390 align:start position:0%
except the value endowed by their great
white

00:57:48.390 --> 00:57:48.400 align:start position:0%
white
 
00:57:51.029 --> 00:57:51.039 align:start position:0%
benefactors it is the same racist
 
00:57:53.390 --> 00:57:53.400 align:start position:0%
ideology that kept people in the chains
 
00:57:56.549 --> 00:57:56.559 align:start position:0%
of slavery The Anthem that sings that we
 
00:57:59.470 --> 00:57:59.480 align:start position:0%
are but animals in need of being kept
 
00:58:02.510 --> 00:58:02.520 align:start position:0%
but now it is slavery of the mind it
 
00:58:04.950 --> 00:58:04.960 align:start position:0%
seems that the governing mentality still
 
00:58:07.710 --> 00:58:07.720 align:start position:0%
expects our peoples to stand in line for
 
00:58:10.910 --> 00:58:10.920 align:start position:0%
handouts from said benefactors do you
 
00:58:13.349 --> 00:58:13.359 align:start position:0%
not realize that you are simply creating
 
00:58:16.230 --> 00:58:16.240 align:start position:0%
a new reality in which your whites are
 
00:58:18.029 --> 00:58:18.039 align:start position:0%
still the
 
00:58:20.630 --> 00:58:20.640 align:start position:0%
oppressors the only difference is that
 
00:58:23.270 --> 00:58:23.280 align:start position:0%
now you oppress our minds with thoughts
 
00:58:26.109 --> 00:58:26.119 align:start position:0%
that we cannot be equal you despair
 
00:58:28.470 --> 00:58:28.480 align:start position:0%
enourage us with statements that only
 
00:58:31.349 --> 00:58:31.359 align:start position:0%
you can lift us up that our peoples lack
 
00:58:34.589 --> 00:58:34.599 align:start position:0%
the strength to do so on our own you Dam
 
00:58:37.029 --> 00:58:37.039 align:start position:0%
us to the slavery of never being capable
 
00:58:39.390 --> 00:58:39.400 align:start position:0%
of catching our own
 
00:58:41.670 --> 00:58:41.680 align:start position:0%
fish perhaps you think that these
 
00:58:44.510 --> 00:58:44.520 align:start position:0%
policies will help that might be what
 
00:58:46.510 --> 00:58:46.520 align:start position:0%
whites thought when the laws that sent
 
00:58:48.829 --> 00:58:48.839 align:start position:0%
people to the homes of my mother and
 
00:58:50.309 --> 00:58:50.319 align:start position:0%
others like her in the middle of the
 
00:58:52.430 --> 00:58:52.440 align:start position:0%
night searching under the beds of her
 
00:58:55.109 --> 00:58:55.119 align:start position:0%
and her siblings making certain that her
 
00:58:57.829 --> 00:58:57.839 align:start position:0%
father was not in the home helping to
 
00:58:59.710 --> 00:58:59.720 align:start position:0%
provide for them lest their government
 
00:59:02.710 --> 00:59:02.720 align:start position:0%
Aid be taken from them my mother learned
 
00:59:05.750 --> 00:59:05.760 align:start position:0%
to hate your handouts and it is a legacy
 
00:59:07.829 --> 00:59:07.839 align:start position:0%
that I respect and will continue with my
 
00:59:10.950 --> 00:59:10.960 align:start position:0%
own children all handouts come at a cost
 
00:59:13.510 --> 00:59:13.520 align:start position:0%
of humiliating the recipients they
 
00:59:16.390 --> 00:59:16.400 align:start position:0%
intend to help I'm sure that's not what
 
00:59:18.829 --> 00:59:18.839 align:start position:0%
you meant to do you might even think
 
00:59:21.390 --> 00:59:21.400 align:start position:0%
you're helping but by the time the ink
 
00:59:23.750 --> 00:59:23.760 align:start position:0%
is draw on the lies you laws you have
 
00:59:26.910 --> 00:59:26.920 align:start position:0%
passed another family is broken another
 
00:59:29.029 --> 00:59:29.039 align:start position:0%
head droops in shame and
 
00:59:31.230 --> 00:59:31.240 align:start position:0%
humiliation so perhaps you should
 
00:59:34.190 --> 00:59:34.200 align:start position:0%
reconsider your choices we've done this
 
00:59:36.829 --> 00:59:36.839 align:start position:0%
before and now an entire race suffers
 
00:59:39.150 --> 00:59:39.160 align:start position:0%
from the damning pandemic of
 
00:59:41.150 --> 00:59:41.160 align:start position:0%
fatherlessness the unintended
 
00:59:44.029 --> 00:59:44.039 align:start position:0%
consequences of your help did not
 
00:59:47.589 --> 00:59:47.599 align:start position:0%
benefit us before please don't help us
 
00:59:50.109 --> 00:59:50.119 align:start position:0%
now sincerely T
 
00:59:52.430 --> 00:59:52.440 align:start position:0%
Johnson please vote red on this
 
00:59:54.750 --> 00:59:54.760 align:start position:0%
misplaced repeal Bill and keep our
 
00:59:57.710 --> 00:59:57.720 align:start position:0%
anti-discrimination law in place thank
 
01:00:00.109 --> 01:00:00.119 align:start position:0%
you and Mr Speaker I would like a roll
 
01:00:01.190 --> 01:00:01.200 align:start position:0%
call on
 
01:00:09.069 --> 01:00:09.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:11.589 --> 01:00:11.599 align:start position:0%
pigo thank you Mr
 
01:00:13.990 --> 01:00:14.000 align:start position:0%
Speaker colleagues New Hampshire is
 
01:00:16.029 --> 01:00:16.039 align:start position:0%
currently struggling with the teacher
 
01:00:19.190 --> 01:00:19.200 align:start position:0%
shortage in fact recently the committee
 
01:00:21.750 --> 01:00:21.760 align:start position:0%
to study New Hampshire teacher shortages
 
01:00:24.589 --> 01:00:24.599 align:start position:0%
and recruitment incentives completed its
 
01:00:27.950 --> 01:00:27.960 align:start position:0%
findings among which teachers reported
 
01:00:29.750 --> 01:00:29.760 align:start position:0%
that the increased politicization of
 
01:00:31.910 --> 01:00:31.920 align:start position:0%
their jobs has discouraged many away
 
01:00:34.309 --> 01:00:34.319 align:start position:0%
from the profession and that they are
 
01:00:36.670 --> 01:00:36.680 align:start position:0%
feeling stress with concerns for
 
01:00:39.029 --> 01:00:39.039 align:start position:0%
consequences as a result of legislation
 
01:00:41.750 --> 01:00:41.760 align:start position:0%
proposed and passed by
 
01:00:45.190 --> 01:00:45.200 align:start position:0%
us it is my hope that today we'll take a
 
01:00:47.470 --> 01:00:47.480 align:start position:0%
step in addressing our teachers concerns
 
01:00:49.630 --> 01:00:49.640 align:start position:0%
by overtraining one of those
 
01:00:52.910 --> 01:00:52.920 align:start position:0%
laws titled the right to freedom from
 
01:00:54.470 --> 01:00:54.480 align:start position:0%
discrimination in the workplace and
 
01:00:56.910 --> 01:00:56.920 align:start position:0%
education yet despite its
 
01:01:01.069 --> 01:01:01.079 align:start position:0%
title it has nothing to do with real
 
01:01:03.710 --> 01:01:03.720 align:start position:0%
discrimination it should have no place
 
01:01:06.750 --> 01:01:06.760 align:start position:0%
on the books in our honorable State one
 
01:01:10.069 --> 01:01:10.079 align:start position:0%
which never received a standalone vote
 
01:01:12.309 --> 01:01:12.319 align:start position:0%
in this chamber but instead was pushed
 
01:01:15.109 --> 01:01:15.119 align:start position:0%
through as part of the budget in
 
01:01:19.029 --> 01:01:19.039 align:start position:0%
2021 it is an insult to our Public
 
01:01:23.029 --> 01:01:23.039 align:start position:0%
School teachers and it gives cover to
 
01:01:25.029 --> 01:01:25.039 align:start position:0%
those who actually hate and are
 
01:01:25.039 --> 01:01:27.589 align:start position:0%
those who actually hate and are
discriminatory

01:01:27.589 --> 01:01:27.599 align:start position:0%
discriminatory
 
01:01:29.630 --> 01:01:29.640 align:start position:0%
in my testimony before the education
 
01:01:33.510 --> 01:01:33.520 align:start position:0%
committee I said not everyone who agrees
 
01:01:35.190 --> 01:01:35.200 align:start position:0%
with this law is a
 
01:01:38.710 --> 01:01:38.720 align:start position:0%
racist but everyone who is racist
 
01:01:40.549 --> 01:01:40.559 align:start position:0%
supports this
 
01:01:40.559 --> 01:01:42.950 align:start position:0%
supports this
law

01:01:42.950 --> 01:01:42.960 align:start position:0%
law
 
01:01:46.069 --> 01:01:46.079 align:start position:0%
well the following day the house will be
 
01:01:50.109 --> 01:01:50.119 align:start position:0%
in order the following day I received a
 
01:01:52.950 --> 01:01:52.960 align:start position:0%
hateful email from a self-avowed
 
01:01:56.109 --> 01:01:56.119 align:start position:0%
racist who also eviscerated me and the
 
01:01:58.150 --> 01:01:58.160 align:start position:0%
members of this chamber for our views on
 
01:02:02.109 --> 01:02:02.119 align:start position:0%
this law he quoted my remarks and then
 
01:02:02.119 --> 01:02:02.870 align:start position:0%
this law he quoted my remarks and then
he

01:02:02.870 --> 01:02:02.880 align:start position:0%
he
 
01:02:08.069 --> 01:02:08.079 align:start position:0%
said Peter is correct about that racists
 
01:02:10.630 --> 01:02:10.640 align:start position:0%
support the current
 
01:02:14.750 --> 01:02:14.760 align:start position:0%
law so let's take a close look at this
 
01:02:18.069 --> 01:02:18.079 align:start position:0%
law it's comprised of four
 
01:02:20.349 --> 01:02:20.359 align:start position:0%
Provisions which on the surface sound
 
01:02:22.430 --> 01:02:22.440 align:start position:0%
perfectly reasonable until you examine
 
01:02:22.440 --> 01:02:23.470 align:start position:0%
perfectly reasonable until you examine
them

01:02:23.470 --> 01:02:23.480 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:02:28.470 --> 01:02:28.480 align:start position:0%
carefully Provisions a C and D are very
 
01:02:31.710 --> 01:02:31.720 align:start position:0%
clear no pupil in any school public
 
01:02:34.910 --> 01:02:34.920 align:start position:0%
school shall be taught that they are
 
01:02:38.870 --> 01:02:38.880 align:start position:0%
superior that's provision a should
 
01:02:42.510 --> 01:02:42.520 align:start position:0%
discriminate provision C or treat others
 
01:02:43.589 --> 01:02:43.599 align:start position:0%
less than
 
01:02:45.630 --> 01:02:45.640 align:start position:0%
equal provision
 
01:02:48.670 --> 01:02:48.680 align:start position:0%
D seriously do we believe that our
 
01:02:50.430 --> 01:02:50.440 align:start position:0%
public schools are instructing children
 
01:02:52.510 --> 01:02:52.520 align:start position:0%
that they are
 
01:02:56.950 --> 01:02:56.960 align:start position:0%
superior really should discriminate
 
01:02:59.710 --> 01:02:59.720 align:start position:0%
treat others less than equal this is
 
01:03:01.910 --> 01:03:01.920 align:start position:0%
where the law insults our teachers I
 
01:03:05.230 --> 01:03:05.240 align:start position:0%
think of Marie my wife who taught
 
01:03:07.309 --> 01:03:07.319 align:start position:0%
Elementary School in Milford for 30
 
01:03:10.390 --> 01:03:10.400 align:start position:0%
years in her classroom she had a sign
 
01:03:14.589 --> 01:03:14.599 align:start position:0%
which simply said the Golden Rule It Was
 
01:03:17.390 --> 01:03:17.400 align:start position:0%
Written in gold colored letters it was
 
01:03:20.029 --> 01:03:20.039 align:start position:0%
in a gold colored frame and she
 
01:03:21.950 --> 01:03:21.960 align:start position:0%
explained to the children that out of
 
01:03:24.910 --> 01:03:24.920 align:start position:0%
all the rules to follow this was the
 
01:03:26.349 --> 01:03:26.359 align:start position:0%
most important
 
01:03:29.950 --> 01:03:29.960 align:start position:0%
to treat others as equals with respect
 
01:03:29.960 --> 01:03:31.390 align:start position:0%
to treat others as equals with respect
and

01:03:31.390 --> 01:03:31.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:03:33.870 --> 01:03:33.880 align:start position:0%
kindness now while these Provisions
 
01:03:35.069 --> 01:03:35.079 align:start position:0%
attempt to make the law sound
 
01:03:36.870 --> 01:03:36.880 align:start position:0%
anti-discriminatory I believe that they
 
01:03:38.470 --> 01:03:38.480 align:start position:0%
meant to camouflage the Law's real
 
01:03:42.150 --> 01:03:42.160 align:start position:0%
intent which is found in provision
 
01:03:45.029 --> 01:03:45.039 align:start position:0%
B that is to silence teaches voices on
 
01:03:46.829 --> 01:03:46.839 align:start position:0%
topics that some don't want
 
01:03:49.630 --> 01:03:49.640 align:start position:0%
discussed what does provision B
 
01:03:53.710 --> 01:03:53.720 align:start position:0%
say no pupil in any public school shall
 
01:03:57.789 --> 01:03:57.799 align:start position:0%
be taught that an individual or group is
 
01:04:01.430 --> 01:04:01.440 align:start position:0%
inherently racist sexist or oppressive
 
01:04:03.910 --> 01:04:03.920 align:start position:0%
now think about that for a moment think
 
01:04:05.870 --> 01:04:05.880 align:start position:0%
about that for a moment are we denying
 
01:04:08.190 --> 01:04:08.200 align:start position:0%
reality of course there are individuals
 
01:04:10.230 --> 01:04:10.240 align:start position:0%
and groups which are racist sexist and
 
01:04:12.910 --> 01:04:12.920 align:start position:0%
oppressive discriminatory to the lgbtq
 
01:04:15.789 --> 01:04:15.799 align:start position:0%
plus Community anti-semitic islamophobic
 
01:04:18.269 --> 01:04:18.279 align:start position:0%
and more our attorney general's office
 
01:04:20.789 --> 01:04:20.799 align:start position:0%
has a list of these hate groups but
 
01:04:23.230 --> 01:04:23.240 align:start position:0%
provision B prevents teachers from
 
01:04:26.190 --> 01:04:26.200 align:start position:0%
saying so this right here is is the
 
01:04:28.589 --> 01:04:28.599 align:start position:0%
Law's real
 
01:04:30.430 --> 01:04:30.440 align:start position:0%
intent by the
 
01:04:33.430 --> 01:04:33.440 align:start position:0%
way if I was
 
01:04:38.029 --> 01:04:38.039 align:start position:0%
asked and I never was I would have
 
01:04:41.109 --> 01:04:41.119 align:start position:0%
said you can always find examples of
 
01:04:43.549 --> 01:04:43.559 align:start position:0%
those in every profession who violate
 
01:04:46.190 --> 01:04:46.200 align:start position:0%
proper conduct but you don't paint
 
01:04:48.309 --> 01:04:48.319 align:start position:0%
everyone with the same brush and imposed
 
01:04:51.069 --> 01:04:51.079 align:start position:0%
Draconian measures which make it
 
01:04:53.789 --> 01:04:53.799 align:start position:0%
challenging for everyone to do their
 
01:04:57.630 --> 01:04:57.640 align:start position:0%
jobs the real question is this can a
 
01:05:00.910 --> 01:05:00.920 align:start position:0%
teacher discuss the Holocaust without
 
01:05:03.589 --> 01:05:03.599 align:start position:0%
making parallels to today's
 
01:05:06.349 --> 01:05:06.359 align:start position:0%
neo-nazis or teach the history of the
 
01:05:08.910 --> 01:05:08.920 align:start position:0%
Klux Clan without examining today's
 
01:05:08.920 --> 01:05:09.990 align:start position:0%
Klux Clan without examining today's
white

01:05:09.990 --> 01:05:10.000 align:start position:0%
white
 
01:05:13.510 --> 01:05:13.520 align:start position:0%
supremacists I recently saw a post that
 
01:05:17.789 --> 01:05:17.799 align:start position:0%
said education is not memorizing that
 
01:05:20.029 --> 01:05:20.039 align:start position:0%
Hitler killed 6 million
 
01:05:23.150 --> 01:05:23.160 align:start position:0%
Jews education is about understanding
 
01:05:26.870 --> 01:05:26.880 align:start position:0%
how and why Millions of ordinary German
 
01:05:28.630 --> 01:05:28.640 align:start position:0%
citizens allowed it to
 
01:05:33.510 --> 01:05:33.520 align:start position:0%
happen the reason we study the past is
 
01:05:36.470 --> 01:05:36.480 align:start position:0%
to understand how we got to where we are
 
01:05:39.470 --> 01:05:39.480 align:start position:0%
today and to work towards making
 
01:05:42.710 --> 01:05:42.720 align:start position:0%
tomorrow a better place for all of us
 
01:05:45.549 --> 01:05:45.559 align:start position:0%
and we cannot do that if we're not
 
01:05:47.950 --> 01:05:47.960 align:start position:0%
allowed to connect the
 
01:05:50.630 --> 01:05:50.640 align:start position:0%
dots colleagues New Hampshire is better
 
01:05:55.710 --> 01:05:55.720 align:start position:0%

current law allows Educators to teach

current law does not prohibit teachers
 
01:08:09.950 --> 01:08:09.960 align:start position:0%

01:19:07.110 --> 01:19:07.120 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
01:19:19.990 --> 01:19:20.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:23.310 --> 01:19:23.320 align:start position:0%
Amendment thank you Mr Speaker I Rise to
 
01:19:27.790 --> 01:19:27.800 align:start position:0%
support um amendment 10 94h when started
 
01:19:29.830 --> 01:19:29.840 align:start position:0%
uh when I started working on this bill I
 
01:19:31.149 --> 01:19:31.159 align:start position:0%
engaged with the university
 
01:19:33.149 --> 01:19:33.159 align:start position:0%
representatives from the beginning and I
 
01:19:34.950 --> 01:19:34.960 align:start position:0%
continue to work with them through all
 
01:19:37.790 --> 01:19:37.800 align:start position:0%
this time The Minority Report see states
 
01:19:39.350 --> 01:19:39.360 align:start position:0%
that the bill does not include any
 
01:19:42.110 --> 01:19:42.120 align:start position:0%
feedback from the University system even
 
01:19:45.550 --> 01:19:45.560 align:start position:0%
though when I tabled HB 516 last year I
 
01:19:48.750 --> 01:19:48.760 align:start position:0%
told everybody here that the university
 
01:19:50.510 --> 01:19:50.520 align:start position:0%
system had required a change to limit
 
01:19:52.990 --> 01:19:53.000 align:start position:0%
their financial liability that change
 
01:19:56.550 --> 01:19:56.560 align:start position:0%
has been made in 1305 as amended so I
 
01:19:58.270 --> 01:19:58.280 align:start position:0%
have to correct the record and say that
 
01:20:00.750 --> 01:20:00.760 align:start position:0%
the bill as filed already had feedback
 
01:20:02.629 --> 01:20:02.639 align:start position:0%
included feedback from the University
 
01:20:08.950 --> 01:20:08.960 align:start position:0%
system we just adopted 065 06 54h same
 
01:20:12.149 --> 01:20:12.159 align:start position:0%
process somebody raised concerns the of
 
01:20:14.350 --> 01:20:14.360 align:start position:0%
the Civil Rights unit of the Attorneys
 
01:20:16.149 --> 01:20:16.159 align:start position:0%
General I worked with them to address
 
01:20:17.950 --> 01:20:17.960 align:start position:0%
their concerns the amendment literally
 
01:20:19.270 --> 01:20:19.280 align:start position:0%
contained the language that the
 
01:20:22.229 --> 01:20:22.239 align:start position:0%
Attorneys General suggested to fix this
 
01:20:24.229 --> 01:20:24.239 align:start position:0%
bill it had been adopted by the
 
01:20:27.550 --> 01:20:27.560 align:start position:0%
committee 128 same process was used to
 
01:20:30.110 --> 01:20:30.120 align:start position:0%
come up with this amendment I continue
 
01:20:31.590 --> 01:20:31.600 align:start position:0%
to work with the university
 
01:20:33.470 --> 01:20:33.480 align:start position:0%
representatives and we found two minor
 
01:20:36.110 --> 01:20:36.120 align:start position:0%
changes that if made would make the bill
 
01:20:40.030 --> 01:20:40.040 align:start position:0%
more palatable to them first we add two
 
01:20:41.629 --> 01:20:41.639 align:start position:0%
words in the first paragraph of the
 
01:20:44.669 --> 01:20:44.679 align:start position:0%
amendment to clarify that while the bill
 
01:20:46.590 --> 01:20:46.600 align:start position:0%
does protect the rights of the members
 
01:20:49.350 --> 01:20:49.360 align:start position:0%
of the Campus Community it does not
 
01:20:51.430 --> 01:20:51.440 align:start position:0%
extend the same level of protections to
 
01:20:53.590 --> 01:20:53.600 align:start position:0%
people unassociated with a university
 
01:20:54.870 --> 01:20:54.880 align:start position:0%
that would just walk in from from the
 
01:20:57.790 --> 01:20:57.800 align:start position:0%
street that was a reasonable concern and
 
01:21:01.270 --> 01:21:01.280 align:start position:0%
I was happy to work with them to make
 
01:21:03.910 --> 01:21:03.920 align:start position:0%
you know it better it also at the
 
01:21:06.910 --> 01:21:06.920 align:start position:0%
request adds two instances where we
 
01:21:08.750 --> 01:21:08.760 align:start position:0%
refer to reasonable time place and
 
01:21:10.590 --> 01:21:10.600 align:start position:0%
manner restrictions to clarify that
 
01:21:12.870 --> 01:21:12.880 align:start position:0%
those restrictions apply at all times I
 
01:21:14.870 --> 01:21:14.880 align:start position:0%
originally felt that my bill language
 
01:21:17.750 --> 01:21:17.760 align:start position:0%
made that clear to start with but after
 
01:21:19.910 --> 01:21:19.920 align:start position:0%
hearing them tell me that it would be
 
01:21:23.229 --> 01:21:23.239 align:start position:0%
better this way I was happy to you know
 
01:21:25.790 --> 01:21:25.800 align:start position:0%
address that I'm not claiming by the way
 
01:21:27.990 --> 01:21:28.000 align:start position:0%
that they will support this bill as
 
01:21:30.830 --> 01:21:30.840 align:start position:0%
amended if they did we'd have a much uh
 
01:21:34.229 --> 01:21:34.239 align:start position:0%
you know smaller floor discussion next
 
01:21:36.550 --> 01:21:36.560 align:start position:0%
but they definitely prefer the bill as
 
01:21:38.350 --> 01:21:38.360 align:start position:0%
amended here to the current language of
 
01:21:40.430 --> 01:21:40.440 align:start position:0%
the bill they do support the amendment
 
01:21:43.310 --> 01:21:43.320 align:start position:0%
10 94h so please show your support for
 
01:21:45.669 --> 01:21:45.679 align:start position:0%
the University system by supporting
 
01:21:48.070 --> 01:21:48.080 align:start position:0%

McDonald thank you Mr Speaker and thank
 
01:25:22.870 --> 01:25:22.880 align:start position:0%
you honorable colleagues for allowing me
 
01:25:24.870 --> 01:25:24.880 align:start position:0%
to speak today
 
01:25:26.390 --> 01:25:26.400 align:start position:0%
I like to
 
01:25:30.550 --> 01:25:30.560 align:start position:0%
talk a lot and both the New Hampshire
 
01:25:34.430 --> 01:25:34.440 align:start position:0%
and US constitutions uphold that right
 
01:25:36.990 --> 01:25:37.000 align:start position:0%
moreover First Amendment protections
 
01:25:41.109 --> 01:25:41.119 align:start position:0%
expand far beyond speech and cover five
 
01:25:44.070 --> 01:25:44.080 align:start position:0%
freedoms two of which are the subject of
 
01:25:46.229 --> 01:25:46.239 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
01:25:49.430 --> 01:25:49.440 align:start position:0%
1305 speech and
 
01:25:52.390 --> 01:25:52.400 align:start position:0%
Association more specifically House Bill
 
01:25:56.070 --> 01:25:56.080 align:start position:0%
1305 relates to new Hampshire college
 
01:26:01.189 --> 01:26:01.199 align:start position:0%
students however we are all students of
 
01:26:03.870 --> 01:26:03.880 align:start position:0%
history and as many Statesmen who came
 
01:26:07.830 --> 01:26:07.840 align:start position:0%
before us have noted quote I may
 
01:26:10.550 --> 01:26:10.560 align:start position:0%
disagree with what you say but I will
 
01:26:15.709 --> 01:26:15.719 align:start position:0%
defend your right to say it end quote As
 
01:26:17.950 --> 01:26:17.960 align:start position:0%
We Gather in this historic chamber
 
01:26:21.030 --> 01:26:21.040 align:start position:0%
representing the multitude of viewpoints
 
01:26:23.830 --> 01:26:23.840 align:start position:0%
that Encompass the granite state these
 
01:26:26.870 --> 01:26:26.880 align:start position:0%
words are relevant
 
01:26:31.350 --> 01:26:31.360 align:start position:0%
today however student organizations are
 
01:26:34.950 --> 01:26:34.960 align:start position:0%
incentivized to do the
 
01:26:38.629 --> 01:26:38.639 align:start position:0%
opposite any person's misbehavior at an
 
01:26:41.550 --> 01:26:41.560 align:start position:0%
event penalizes the student group
 
01:26:45.870 --> 01:26:45.880 align:start position:0%
hosting the event therefore the hecklers
 
01:26:49.590 --> 01:26:49.600 align:start position:0%
veto prohibits future events in other
 
01:26:52.709 --> 01:26:52.719 align:start position:0%
words the student organization loses
 
01:26:55.709 --> 01:26:55.719 align:start position:0%
their rights through no no fault of
 
01:26:59.669 --> 01:26:59.679 align:start position:0%
their own not only is this unfair but
 
01:27:02.629 --> 01:27:02.639 align:start position:0%
this is also
 
01:27:05.990 --> 01:27:06.000 align:start position:0%
unamerican the absolute violation of
 
01:27:08.510 --> 01:27:08.520 align:start position:0%
bothur constitutions renders the
 
01:27:12.149 --> 01:27:12.159 align:start position:0%
university system open to expensive
 
01:27:16.070 --> 01:27:16.080 align:start position:0%
lawsuits therefore House Bill 1305 is
 
01:27:19.470 --> 01:27:19.480 align:start position:0%
Paramount to protecting taxpayers from
 
01:27:23.229 --> 01:27:23.239 align:start position:0%
Financial Risk considering it is the
 
01:27:27.189 --> 01:27:27.199 align:start position:0%
second most expensive State University
 
01:27:29.790 --> 01:27:29.800 align:start position:0%
Nationwide the University of New
 
01:27:33.270 --> 01:27:33.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is already a financial burden
 
01:27:36.350 --> 01:27:36.360 align:start position:0%
needless to say litigation reduces
 
01:27:39.149 --> 01:27:39.159 align:start position:0%
instructional resources increases tax
 
01:27:42.310 --> 01:27:42.320 align:start position:0%
liability and is not conducive to
 
01:27:45.189 --> 01:27:45.199 align:start position:0%
learning after all the purpose of
 
01:27:47.550 --> 01:27:47.560 align:start position:0%
college is to get an
 
01:27:51.270 --> 01:27:51.280 align:start position:0%
education furthermore House Bill 1305
 
01:27:53.629 --> 01:27:53.639 align:start position:0%
aligns with Supreme Court rulings by
 
01:27:53.639 --> 01:27:54.709 align:start position:0%
aligns with Supreme Court rulings by
prohibiting

01:27:54.709 --> 01:27:54.719 align:start position:0%
prohibiting
 
01:27:59.910 --> 01:27:59.920 align:start position:0%
Free Speech zones in other words speech
 
01:28:02.550 --> 01:28:02.560 align:start position:0%
should not be limited to the back corner
 
01:28:05.830 --> 01:28:05.840 align:start position:0%
of the parking lot and prohibited
 
01:28:10.590 --> 01:28:10.600 align:start position:0%
everywhere else finally last year a
 
01:28:12.790 --> 01:28:12.800 align:start position:0%
similar bill was laid on the table so
 
01:28:16.430 --> 01:28:16.440 align:start position:0%
not debated today New Hampshire students
 
01:28:19.910 --> 01:28:19.920 align:start position:0%
are not only listening to this debate
 
01:28:22.470 --> 01:28:22.480 align:start position:0%
but also want to know which
 
01:28:24.990 --> 01:28:25.000 align:start position:0%
representatives defend
 
01:28:28.709 --> 01:28:28.719 align:start position:0%
Freedom so Mr Speaker on their behalf I
 
01:28:32.229 --> 01:28:32.239 align:start position:0%
request a roll call vote thank you J
 
01:28:41.590 --> 01:28:41.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:45.109 --> 01:28:45.119 align:start position:0%
wheeler thank you Mr
 
01:28:48.189 --> 01:28:48.199 align:start position:0%
Speaker I Rise before you today because
 
01:28:50.270 --> 01:28:50.280 align:start position:0%

co-sponsor to come speak before you
 
01:28:56.350 --> 01:28:56.360 align:start position:0%
today about the importance of freedom of
 
01:28:58.390 --> 01:28:58.400 align:start position:0%
speech and Mr Speaker it's a pleasure to
 
01:29:00.310 --> 01:29:00.320 align:start position:0%
finally be able to get to speak on the
 
01:29:02.149 --> 01:29:02.159 align:start position:0%
same side as the of the aisle as my
 
01:29:05.310 --> 01:29:05.320 align:start position:0%
friend from Salem uh she's a passionate
 
01:29:07.310 --> 01:29:07.320 align:start position:0%
individual a young person who has spent
 
01:29:08.910 --> 01:29:08.920 align:start position:0%
a lot of time here and it's a it's a
 
01:29:10.070 --> 01:29:10.080 align:start position:0%
great thing to be able to get to speak
 
01:29:13.430 --> 01:29:13.440 align:start position:0%
with her this bill very simple there's a
 
01:29:15.910 --> 01:29:15.920 align:start position:0%
problem in our schools right now that
 
01:29:18.189 --> 01:29:18.199 align:start position:0%
students have been reporting for
 
01:29:20.229 --> 01:29:20.239 align:start position:0%
unfortunately a long time their free
 
01:29:23.470 --> 01:29:23.480 align:start position:0%
speech has been hampered and this is
 
01:29:26.149 --> 01:29:26.159 align:start position:0%
students both conservative students
 
01:29:27.910 --> 01:29:27.920 align:start position:0%
liberal students socialist students and
 
01:29:30.350 --> 01:29:30.360 align:start position:0%
libertarian students people have had
 
01:29:34.510 --> 01:29:34.520 align:start position:0%
their ability to speak on issues Stamper
 
01:29:36.870 --> 01:29:36.880 align:start position:0%
by college administrators who are trying
 
01:29:40.709 --> 01:29:40.719 align:start position:0%
their hardest to keep things nice
 
01:29:43.310 --> 01:29:43.320 align:start position:0%
unfortunately for those who want to keep
 
01:29:45.629 --> 01:29:45.639 align:start position:0%
things nice and calm and respectful
 
01:29:47.790 --> 01:29:47.800 align:start position:0%
sometimes freedom of speech requires us
 
01:29:51.070 --> 01:29:51.080 align:start position:0%
to be a little bit passionate it
 
01:29:53.709 --> 01:29:53.719 align:start position:0%
requires us to say something that the
 
01:29:55.030 --> 01:29:55.040 align:start position:0%
majority majority of the people in the
 
01:29:57.830 --> 01:29:57.840 align:start position:0%
room might disagree with uh in fact
 
01:30:01.109 --> 01:30:01.119 align:start position:0%
that's what protests is all about and Mr
 
01:30:03.310 --> 01:30:03.320 align:start position:0%
Speaker this bill was worked on
 
01:30:07.030 --> 01:30:07.040 align:start position:0%
extraordinarily hard for the last bium
 
01:30:10.030 --> 01:30:10.040 align:start position:0%
as a matter of fact it was introduced in
 
01:30:12.149 --> 01:30:12.159 align:start position:0%
the beginning of this bium and now we
 
01:30:15.310 --> 01:30:15.320 align:start position:0%
are here towards the end of it debating
 
01:30:18.070 --> 01:30:18.080 align:start position:0%
the final version of this bill the
 
01:30:20.070 --> 01:30:20.080 align:start position:0%
sponsor worked with the Civil Rights
 
01:30:22.189 --> 01:30:22.199 align:start position:0%
division of the AG's office to make sure
 
01:30:25.070 --> 01:30:25.080 align:start position:0%
that it fits and is comp iant with what
 
01:30:27.229 --> 01:30:27.239 align:start position:0%
they need to do in that office making
 
01:30:28.510 --> 01:30:28.520 align:start position:0%
sure that it doesn't have any civil
 
01:30:31.189 --> 01:30:31.199 align:start position:0%
rights violations in it and they worked
 
01:30:33.750 --> 01:30:33.760 align:start position:0%
very hard with the university the system
 
01:30:36.510 --> 01:30:36.520 align:start position:0%
to make sure that it met their concerns
 
01:30:39.950 --> 01:30:39.960 align:start position:0%
and this is important because this
 
01:30:42.350 --> 01:30:42.360 align:start position:0%
government this country in this world
 
01:30:44.910 --> 01:30:44.920 align:start position:0%
depends on the Constitution that we have
 
01:30:47.070 --> 01:30:47.080 align:start position:0%
here in the United States of America
 
01:30:48.709 --> 01:30:48.719 align:start position:0%
there are many countries in this world
 
01:30:51.470 --> 01:30:51.480 align:start position:0%
that don't have basic foundational
 
01:30:53.629 --> 01:30:53.639 align:start position:0%
constitutional rights and they look to
 
01:30:55.590 --> 01:30:55.600 align:start position:0%
the United States of America are red
 
01:30:58.990 --> 01:30:59.000 align:start position:0%
white and blue stripes for inspiration
 
01:31:01.270 --> 01:31:01.280 align:start position:0%
for those constitutional rights and if
 
01:31:03.750 --> 01:31:03.760 align:start position:0%
we here in this body today don't say
 
01:31:06.990 --> 01:31:07.000 align:start position:0%
that our students on the institutions
 
01:31:08.629 --> 01:31:08.639 align:start position:0%
where they're learning have those
 
01:31:10.270 --> 01:31:10.280 align:start position:0%
constitutional rights freedom of
 
01:31:11.830 --> 01:31:11.840 align:start position:0%
Association freedom of speech we all
 
01:31:13.590 --> 01:31:13.600 align:start position:0%
know the Gambit that I think we're
 
01:31:17.149 --> 01:31:17.159 align:start position:0%
failing them because our institutions of
 
01:31:18.950 --> 01:31:18.960 align:start position:0%
Educational Learning our especially our
 
01:31:21.669 --> 01:31:21.679 align:start position:0%
higher instit in our higher education
 
01:31:23.709 --> 01:31:23.719 align:start position:0%
institutions should be places where we
 
01:31:26.830 --> 01:31:26.840 align:start position:0%
can can vociferously debate these issues
 
01:31:29.870 --> 01:31:29.880 align:start position:0%
where everybody from every side can come
 
01:31:32.270 --> 01:31:32.280 align:start position:0%
and tell why or why not they have the
 
01:31:36.030 --> 01:31:36.040 align:start position:0%
beliefs that they do and yes sometimes
 
01:31:39.310 --> 01:31:39.320 align:start position:0%
those beliefs will be abhorent to most
 
01:31:42.030 --> 01:31:42.040 align:start position:0%
of us that's what freedom of speech is
 
01:31:45.669 --> 01:31:45.679 align:start position:0%
about the founders were smart they were
 
01:31:48.149 --> 01:31:48.159 align:start position:0%
intelligent and they knew that the
 
01:31:50.709 --> 01:31:50.719 align:start position:0%
minority view needed to be protected in
 
01:31:53.550 --> 01:31:53.560 align:start position:0%
a constitutional republic if it was to
 
01:31:53.560 --> 01:31:54.790 align:start position:0%
a constitutional republic if it was to
survive

01:31:54.790 --> 01:31:54.800 align:start position:0%
survive
 
01:31:57.870 --> 01:31:57.880 align:start position:0%
it's the first amendment isn't for
 
01:31:59.470 --> 01:31:59.480 align:start position:0%
things that we all agree about you know
 
01:32:00.870 --> 01:32:00.880 align:start position:0%
I I don't need the First Amendment to
 
01:32:02.189 --> 01:32:02.199 align:start position:0%
protect me from my right to say that
 
01:32:04.149 --> 01:32:04.159 align:start position:0%
puppies are cute I think most of us
 
01:32:07.109 --> 01:32:07.119 align:start position:0%
agree puppies are cute I need my first
 
01:32:10.350 --> 01:32:10.360 align:start position:0%
amendment rights to protect me from
 
01:32:12.669 --> 01:32:12.679 align:start position:0%
people who would prosecute me for my
 
01:32:15.109 --> 01:32:15.119 align:start position:0%
position on something that they don't
 
01:32:17.270 --> 01:32:17.280 align:start position:0%
agree with Min someone Prosecuting a
 
01:32:20.590 --> 01:32:20.600 align:start position:0%
minority view so Mr Speaker to protect
 
01:32:22.830 --> 01:32:22.840 align:start position:0%
our educational institutions and make

college
 
01:33:07.470 --> 01:33:07.480 align:start position:0%
campuses and while the bill has some
 
01:33:07.480 --> 01:33:08.310 align:start position:0%
campuses and while the bill has some
good

01:33:08.310 --> 01:33:08.320 align:start position:0%
good
 
01:33:11.350 --> 01:33:11.360 align:start position:0%
aspects they're already being done
 
01:33:12.910 --> 01:33:12.920 align:start position:0%
throughout the state's University and
 
01:33:15.030 --> 01:33:15.040 align:start position:0%
Community College systems and are
 
01:33:18.510 --> 01:33:18.520 align:start position:0%
included in free speech policies at UNH
 
01:33:22.750 --> 01:33:22.760 align:start position:0%
Plymouth Keane and all the community
 
01:33:25.470 --> 01:33:25.480 align:start position:0%
colleges UNH is ranked third in the
 
01:33:27.550 --> 01:33:27.560 align:start position:0%
country among all colleges and
 
01:33:30.390 --> 01:33:30.400 align:start position:0%
universities for its policies on free
 
01:33:33.149 --> 01:33:33.159 align:start position:0%
speech and expression and all of our
 
01:33:35.470 --> 01:33:35.480 align:start position:0%
state's fouryear institutions receive
 
01:33:37.629 --> 01:33:37.639 align:start position:0%
green lights from the foundation for
 
01:33:40.270 --> 01:33:40.280 align:start position:0%
individual rights and expression this
 
01:33:43.310 --> 01:33:43.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:46.229 --> 01:33:46.239 align:start position:0%
unnecessary but most importantly the
 
01:33:49.189 --> 01:33:49.199 align:start position:0%
bill overreaches far beyond speech and
 
01:33:51.270 --> 01:33:51.280 align:start position:0%
expression and we haven't talked about
 
01:33:51.280 --> 01:33:52.350 align:start position:0%
expression and we haven't talked about
this

01:33:52.350 --> 01:33:52.360 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:33:55.310 --> 01:33:55.320 align:start position:0%
yet it requires our state colleges and
 
01:33:57.669 --> 01:33:57.679 align:start position:0%
universities to recognize student
 
01:34:00.270 --> 01:34:00.280 align:start position:0%
organizations that discriminate on the
 
01:34:03.590 --> 01:34:03.600 align:start position:0%
basis of race gender religion and
 
01:34:03.600 --> 01:34:04.910 align:start position:0%
basis of race gender religion and
political

01:34:04.910 --> 01:34:04.920 align:start position:0%
political
 
01:34:07.910 --> 01:34:07.920 align:start position:0%
ideology and the bill would require UNH
 
01:34:10.109 --> 01:34:10.119 align:start position:0%
and the other colleges and universities
 
01:34:11.750 --> 01:34:11.760 align:start position:0%
to fund these
 
01:34:14.790 --> 01:34:14.800 align:start position:0%
groups some of them being hate groups
 
01:34:17.590 --> 01:34:17.600 align:start position:0%
with money coming from taxpayers tuition
 
01:34:17.600 --> 01:34:19.070 align:start position:0%
with money coming from taxpayers tuition
and

01:34:19.070 --> 01:34:19.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:34:22.709 --> 01:34:22.719 align:start position:0%
fees are you kidding really is this what
 
01:34:25.229 --> 01:34:25.239 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is all about out this bill
 
01:34:28.229 --> 01:34:28.239 align:start position:0%
fuels a divisive environment on campus
 
01:34:29.830 --> 01:34:29.840 align:start position:0%
and it violates our state's own
 
01:34:32.550 --> 01:34:32.560 align:start position:0%
anti-discrimination laws and federal law
 
01:34:35.870 --> 01:34:35.880 align:start position:0%
such as Title 9 taxpayers and families
 
01:34:39.229 --> 01:34:39.239 align:start position:0%
expect better the sponsors ignored input
 
01:34:41.030 --> 01:34:41.040 align:start position:0%
and feedback from the universities and
 
01:34:41.040 --> 01:34:42.109 align:start position:0%
and feedback from the universities and
community

01:34:42.109 --> 01:34:42.119 align:start position:0%
community
 
01:34:44.629 --> 01:34:44.639 align:start position:0%
colleges bills like this would promote
 
01:34:46.629 --> 01:34:46.639 align:start position:0%
discrimination and hate speech and
 
01:34:49.590 --> 01:34:49.600 align:start position:0%
should be resoundingly rejected press
 
01:34:52.149 --> 01:34:52.159 align:start position:0%
the red button if you support
 
01:34:54.270 --> 01:34:54.280 align:start position:0%
anti-discrimination and you know there's
 
01:34:56.189 --> 01:34:56.199 align:start position:0%
a lot of unh graduates here in New
 
01:34:58.229 --> 01:34:58.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and they want to know what
 
01:35:01.310 --> 01:35:01.320 align:start position:0%
side you're on so I'm going to stand by
 
01:35:03.350 --> 01:35:03.360 align:start position:0%
and request the roll call vote as well
 
01:35:05.750 --> 01:35:05.760 align:start position:0%

01:35:14.350 --> 01:35:14.360 align:start position:0%

01:35:40.669 --> 01:35:40.679 align:start position:0%
the time to consider everything at
 
01:35:43.070 --> 01:35:43.080 align:start position:0%
length I could address The Minority

Report point that we're doing great and
 
01:35:47.149 --> 01:35:47.159 align:start position:0%
we are ranked third by fire but our fire
 
01:35:49.790 --> 01:35:49.800 align:start position:0%
score is of only 72 out of 100 which is
 
01:35:52.510 --> 01:35:52.520 align:start position:0%
a rather mediocre C minus I think it's
 
01:35:54.070 --> 01:35:54.080 align:start position:0%
perfectly reasonable to to ask our
 
01:35:57.070 --> 01:35:57.080 align:start position:0%
University to do better I could remind
 
01:35:59.109 --> 01:35:59.119 align:start position:0%
you that UC Berkeley went from being the
 
01:36:01.750 --> 01:36:01.760 align:start position:0%
heart of the Free Speech movement to
 
01:36:03.390 --> 01:36:03.400 align:start position:0%
suffering from repeated cases of
 
01:36:05.629 --> 01:36:05.639 align:start position:0%
violence being used to suppress speech
 
01:36:08.189 --> 01:36:08.199 align:start position:0%
just like upen went from being against
 
01:36:10.149 --> 01:36:10.159 align:start position:0%
free speech to being for free speech to
 
01:36:13.510 --> 01:36:13.520 align:start position:0%
again being against Free Speech we have
 
01:36:15.990 --> 01:36:16.000 align:start position:0%
a duty to set standards and make sure
 
01:36:18.590 --> 01:36:18.600 align:start position:0%
that our universities respect Free
 
01:36:20.430 --> 01:36:20.440 align:start position:0%
Speech permanently so this legislation
 
01:36:22.910 --> 01:36:22.920 align:start position:0%
is needed I could spend time to address
 
01:36:25.590 --> 01:36:25.600 align:start position:0%
the other part in claim that HB 30305
 
01:36:29.030 --> 01:36:29.040 align:start position:0%
and I quote violates our state's own dis
 
01:36:32.350 --> 01:36:32.360 align:start position:0%
non-discrimination laws and federal law
 
01:36:34.109 --> 01:36:34.119 align:start position:0%
but to take that claim seriously you'd
 
01:36:35.830 --> 01:36:35.840 align:start position:0%
have to believe that nobody noticed it
 
01:36:37.910 --> 01:36:37.920 align:start position:0%
until now because nobody testified
 
01:36:39.990 --> 01:36:40.000 align:start position:0%
against it in committee you'd have to
 
01:36:41.870 --> 01:36:41.880 align:start position:0%
believe that the ACLU endorsed this bill
 
01:36:43.149 --> 01:36:43.159 align:start position:0%
two years in a row because they just
 
01:36:45.629 --> 01:36:45.639 align:start position:0%
didn't notice it was dismantling our
 
01:36:48.629 --> 01:36:48.639 align:start position:0%
anti-discrimination laws which ACLU is
 
01:36:49.870 --> 01:36:49.880 align:start position:0%
defending so
 
01:36:52.030 --> 01:36:52.040 align:start position:0%
staunchly and you'd have to believe that
 
01:36:54.030 --> 01:36:54.040 align:start position:0%
the director of the Civil Rights
 
01:36:56.629 --> 01:36:56.639 align:start position:0%
after a thorough review of this bill
 
01:36:59.790 --> 01:36:59.800 align:start position:0%
also failed to notice that this bill
 
01:37:02.629 --> 01:37:02.639 align:start position:0%
disc dismantles the statutes that the
 
01:37:06.149 --> 01:37:06.159 align:start position:0%
office you know of the Civil Rights unit
 
01:37:10.590 --> 01:37:10.600 align:start position:0%
is designed to protect here so why the
 
01:37:12.750 --> 01:37:12.760 align:start position:0%
opposition to this bill if you took the
 
01:37:14.669 --> 01:37:14.679 align:start position:0%
10 minutes that I asked you for when I
 
01:37:16.350 --> 01:37:16.360 align:start position:0%
sent you that email yesterday to watch
 
01:37:19.109 --> 01:37:19.119 align:start position:0%
the videos you already know this
 
01:37:21.990 --> 01:37:22.000 align:start position:0%
publicly stated desire to ban student
 
01:37:24.229 --> 01:37:24.239 align:start position:0%
associations with beliefs one finds
 
01:37:26.709 --> 01:37:26.719 align:start position:0%
repugnant is very understandable it's
 
01:37:30.030 --> 01:37:30.040 align:start position:0%
human nature but acting on such desires
 
01:37:32.229 --> 01:37:32.239 align:start position:0%
is unconstitutional and a terrible
 
01:37:35.669 --> 01:37:35.679 align:start position:0%
policy we cannot and should not punish
 
01:37:37.910 --> 01:37:37.920 align:start position:0%
People based on content of their lawful
 
01:37:40.550 --> 01:37:40.560 align:start position:0%
speech regardless of how repugnant we
 
01:37:42.310 --> 01:37:42.320 align:start position:0%
may find it free speech is the
 
01:37:44.350 --> 01:37:44.360 align:start position:0%
Cornerstone of our nation tampering with
 
01:37:45.510 --> 01:37:45.520 align:start position:0%
it is
 
01:37:47.870 --> 01:37:47.880 align:start position:0%
foolish I want to remind you that a lot
 
01:37:50.149 --> 01:37:50.159 align:start position:0%
of commonly accepted beliefs today have
 
01:37:52.229 --> 01:37:52.239 align:start position:0%
been considered repugnant at the
 
01:37:54.990 --> 01:37:55.000 align:start position:0%
beginning Abol ISM was considered
 
01:37:57.070 --> 01:37:57.080 align:start position:0%
repugnant and it was attacked because of
 
01:37:59.229 --> 01:37:59.239 align:start position:0%
claims of emotional harm against the
 
01:37:59.239 --> 01:38:00.149 align:start position:0%
claims of emotional harm against the
slave

01:38:00.149 --> 01:38:00.159 align:start position:0%
slave
 
01:38:03.109 --> 01:38:03.119 align:start position:0%
owners women's rights were considered a
 
01:38:06.390 --> 01:38:06.400 align:start position:0%
repugnant idea how dare you you gay
 
01:38:08.629 --> 01:38:08.639 align:start position:0%
rights were so Radioactive in the 50s
 
01:38:10.750 --> 01:38:10.760 align:start position:0%
that the ACL refused to even represent
 
01:38:12.709 --> 01:38:12.719 align:start position:0%
them it took another decade until the
 
01:38:15.950 --> 01:38:15.960 align:start position:0%
ACLU was comfortable enough so many
 
01:38:19.470 --> 01:38:19.480 align:start position:0%
ideas are strong today because someone
 
01:38:21.390 --> 01:38:21.400 align:start position:0%
protected them the First Amendment
 
01:38:23.149 --> 01:38:23.159 align:start position:0%
against the people who wanted to silence
 
01:38:26.030 --> 01:38:26.040 align:start position:0%
them until they grew into the supported
 
01:38:29.149 --> 01:38:29.159 align:start position:0%
ideas that are today the freedom of
 
01:38:31.750 --> 01:38:31.760 align:start position:0%
Association bans all Commerce policies
 
01:38:33.229 --> 01:38:33.239 align:start position:0%
which would require every Student
 
01:38:35.830 --> 01:38:35.840 align:start position:0%
Association to accept every
 
01:38:38.830 --> 01:38:38.840 align:start position:0%
member those policies are discriminatory
 
01:38:41.390 --> 01:38:41.400 align:start position:0%
in intent and in application because to
 
01:38:43.510 --> 01:38:43.520 align:start position:0%
apply them literally the way they are
 
01:38:45.669 --> 01:38:45.679 align:start position:0%
written would require every University
 
01:38:48.510 --> 01:38:48.520 align:start position:0%
to remove every safe space because every
 
01:38:50.790 --> 01:38:50.800 align:start position:0%
safe space is discriminatory that way
 
01:38:52.750 --> 01:38:52.760 align:start position:0%
you don't allow everybody in nobody
 
01:38:55.550 --> 01:38:55.560 align:start position:0%
intends to do that and they shouldn't
 
01:38:57.149 --> 01:38:57.159 align:start position:0%
all we are asking for is the same
 
01:38:59.149 --> 01:38:59.159 align:start position:0%
treatment for everybody to have their
 
01:39:01.550 --> 01:39:01.560 align:start position:0%
own safe spaces to meet should apply to
 
01:39:03.790 --> 01:39:03.800 align:start position:0%
everyone same thing with the minimal
 
01:39:06.790 --> 01:39:06.800 align:start position:0%
funds that they get from the University
 
01:39:08.310 --> 01:39:08.320 align:start position:0%
which by the way come from Student
 
01:39:10.669 --> 01:39:10.679 align:start position:0%
Activity fees not taxpayer money not
 
01:39:13.070 --> 01:39:13.080 align:start position:0%
tuition funds Student Activities fees
 
01:39:15.669 --> 01:39:15.679 align:start position:0%
from the people you know who attend
 
01:39:16.990 --> 01:39:17.000 align:start position:0%
there is no requirement for the
 
01:39:18.870 --> 01:39:18.880 align:start position:0%
University to offer any funds to any
 
01:39:20.709 --> 01:39:20.719 align:start position:0%
Student Association the bill simply says
 
01:39:22.430 --> 01:39:22.440 align:start position:0%
that if you do it you got to give it to
 
01:39:24.430 --> 01:39:24.440 align:start position:0%
everybody equally
 
01:39:26.270 --> 01:39:26.280 align:start position:0%
you don't have to if you find that
 
01:39:28.629 --> 01:39:28.639 align:start position:0%
objectional equal protection under the
 
01:39:30.790 --> 01:39:30.800 align:start position:0%
law equal rights for everyone that is
 
01:39:33.990 --> 01:39:34.000 align:start position:0%
all we are asking for The Minority
 
01:39:36.030 --> 01:39:36.040 align:start position:0%
Report also appears to consistently
 
01:39:38.310 --> 01:39:38.320 align:start position:0%
confuse discrimination which is legal
 
01:39:40.990 --> 01:39:41.000 align:start position:0%
and good with illegal discrimination
 
01:39:42.750 --> 01:39:42.760 align:start position:0%
which is based on belonging to a
 
01:39:46.270 --> 01:39:46.280 align:start position:0%
protected class which is bad and illegal
 
01:39:48.430 --> 01:39:48.440 align:start position:0%
UNH discriminates against every student
 
01:39:50.470 --> 01:39:50.480 align:start position:0%
they reject should they accept everybody
 
01:39:50.480 --> 01:39:51.470 align:start position:0%
they reject should they accept everybody
who

01:39:51.470 --> 01:39:51.480 align:start position:0%
who
 
01:39:53.830 --> 01:39:53.840 align:start position:0%
applies does the school dis discriminate
 
01:39:55.790 --> 01:39:55.800 align:start position:0%
against athletically challenged students
 
01:39:58.629 --> 01:39:58.639 align:start position:0%
by not letting a 5 foot student who's
 
01:40:01.070 --> 01:40:01.080 align:start position:0%
weighing 100 pound play nose tackle or
 
01:40:03.350 --> 01:40:03.360 align:start position:0%
Center on the basketball team how dare
 
01:40:03.360 --> 01:40:05.109 align:start position:0%
Center on the basketball team how dare
you

01:40:05.109 --> 01:40:05.119 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:40:08.589 --> 01:40:08.599 align:start position:0%
discriminate seriously and please please
 
01:40:11.189 --> 01:40:11.199 align:start position:0%
try to imagine a world in which you
 
01:40:13.669 --> 01:40:13.679 align:start position:0%
would be legally required to date
 
01:40:16.910 --> 01:40:16.920 align:start position:0%
anybody who asks you out because to deny
 
01:40:19.109 --> 01:40:19.119 align:start position:0%
somebody's discriminatory of course it's
 
01:40:20.910 --> 01:40:20.920 align:start position:0%
not illegally discriminatory thank God
 
01:40:22.629 --> 01:40:22.639 align:start position:0%
nobody suggesting those policies are
 
01:40:24.510 --> 01:40:24.520 align:start position:0%
good by by the the same token all
 
01:40:27.310 --> 01:40:27.320 align:start position:0%
Commerce policies are terrible so we
 
01:40:30.030 --> 01:40:30.040 align:start position:0%
should make sure they don't come in but
 
01:40:31.990 --> 01:40:32.000 align:start position:0%
for the record illegal discriminations
 
01:40:34.870 --> 01:40:34.880 align:start position:0%
are still the red hering every example
 
01:40:36.910 --> 01:40:36.920 align:start position:0%
of undesirable student associations
 
01:40:39.629 --> 01:40:39.639 align:start position:0%
discussed in hearings both in 2023 and
 
01:40:42.629 --> 01:40:42.639 align:start position:0%
24 was based on their beliefs speech and
 
01:40:44.390 --> 01:40:44.400 align:start position:0%
expression whether it was their
 
01:40:47.430 --> 01:40:47.440 align:start position:0%
purported support for genocide or their
 
01:40:49.189 --> 01:40:49.199 align:start position:0%
Neo-Nazi membership or white
 
01:40:51.350 --> 01:40:51.360 align:start position:0%
supremacists or
 
01:40:53.430 --> 01:40:53.440 align:start position:0%
anti-semitic if even members of the
 
01:40:55.229 --> 01:40:55.239 align:start position:0%
education committee cannot resist the
 
01:40:57.870 --> 01:40:57.880 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional desire to ban certain
 
01:40:59.510 --> 01:40:59.520 align:start position:0%
student associations in order to
 
01:41:02.229 --> 01:41:02.239 align:start position:0%
suppress speech they find repugnant what
 
01:41:04.390 --> 01:41:04.400 align:start position:0%
chance does the faculty staff and
 
01:41:08.149 --> 01:41:08.159 align:start position:0%
student membership have to resist the
 
01:41:10.510 --> 01:41:10.520 align:start position:0%
same Temptation This by the way is
 
01:41:12.629 --> 01:41:12.639 align:start position:0%
precisely the type of student ban that
 
01:41:15.750 --> 01:41:15.760 align:start position:0%
victims testified about in 2023 and I am
 
01:41:18.950 --> 01:41:18.960 align:start position:0%
dismayed by the fact that people who
 
01:41:21.350 --> 01:41:21.360 align:start position:0%
watch this testimony are trying to
 
01:41:22.950 --> 01:41:22.960 align:start position:0%
oppose the bill that's trying to prevent
 
01:41:25.910 --> 01:41:25.920 align:start position:0%
f their abuses and by the way another
 
01:41:27.589 --> 01:41:27.599 align:start position:0%
one of those situations happened later
 
01:41:30.310 --> 01:41:30.320 align:start position:0%
in 2023 reminding us of a need to pass
 
01:41:32.350 --> 01:41:32.360 align:start position:0%
this bill to make it crystal clear to
 
01:41:34.550 --> 01:41:34.560 align:start position:0%
everyone that we do not tolerate such
 
01:41:36.510 --> 01:41:36.520 align:start position:0%
actions in the state of New Hampshire
 
01:41:37.990 --> 01:41:38.000 align:start position:0%
I'm asking you all to reject these
 
01:41:39.550 --> 01:41:39.560 align:start position:0%
attempts to enable oppression of
 
01:41:42.510 --> 01:41:42.520 align:start position:0%
minorities based on their beliefs lawful
 
01:41:44.430 --> 01:41:44.440 align:start position:0%
beliefs and speech and protect all
 
01:41:46.109 --> 01:41:46.119 align:start position:0%

01:43:18.950 --> 01:43:18.960 align:start position:0%
vote chair recognized representative
 
01:43:22.109 --> 01:43:22.119 align:start position:0%

inquiry

01:43:30.709 --> 01:43:30.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:33.870 --> 01:43:33.880 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker if I know that the
 
01:43:35.990 --> 01:43:36.000 align:start position:0%
university and Community College systems
 
01:43:39.109 --> 01:43:39.119 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire already have effective
 
01:43:41.390 --> 01:43:41.400 align:start position:0%
policy standards for free speech and
 
01:43:43.629 --> 01:43:43.639 align:start position:0%
expression and are highly ranked
 
01:43:46.350 --> 01:43:46.360 align:start position:0%
nationally for their Fair application of
 
01:43:49.070 --> 01:43:49.080 align:start position:0%
those policies and if I know that this
 
01:43:51.149 --> 01:43:51.159 align:start position:0%
bill would require our state colleges
 
01:43:54.430 --> 01:43:54.440 align:start position:0%
and universities to recognize and fund
 
01:43:56.510 --> 01:43:56.520 align:start position:0%
organizations that discriminate on the
 
01:43:59.149 --> 01:43:59.159 align:start position:0%
basis of race gender religion and
 
01:44:01.990 --> 01:44:02.000 align:start position:0%
political ideology and if I know that
 
01:44:04.629 --> 01:44:04.639 align:start position:0%
despite its title this bill actually
 
01:44:06.669 --> 01:44:06.679 align:start position:0%
violates our state non-discrimination
 
01:44:09.910 --> 01:44:09.920 align:start position:0%
laws would I now press the red button
 
01:44:12.750 --> 01:44:12.760 align:start position:0%
thank you chair recognize representative
 
01:44:16.350 --> 01:44:16.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:19.510 --> 01:44:19.520 align:start position:0%
inquiry thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker
 
01:44:22.030 --> 01:44:22.040 align:start position:0%
if I know that freedom of expression and
 
01:44:24.350 --> 01:44:24.360 align:start position:0%
freedom of Association are under attack
 
01:44:26.950 --> 01:44:26.960 align:start position:0%
in this country particularly in our
 
01:44:29.310 --> 01:44:29.320 align:start position:0%
academic institutions which should be
 
01:44:31.070 --> 01:44:31.080 align:start position:0%
the last place we would expect this to
 
01:44:33.550 --> 01:44:33.560 align:start position:0%
occur and if I know that although New
 
01:44:35.070 --> 01:44:35.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Public colleges and
 
01:44:37.790 --> 01:44:37.800 align:start position:0%
universities Faire better in this regard
 
01:44:40.229 --> 01:44:40.239 align:start position:0%
than private colleges and universities
 
01:44:42.790 --> 01:44:42.800 align:start position:0%
and those in some other states our
 
01:44:44.709 --> 01:44:44.719 align:start position:0%
public institutions of Higher Learning
 
01:44:47.470 --> 01:44:47.480 align:start position:0%
have not been immune to the uh to the
 
01:44:50.910 --> 01:44:50.920 align:start position:0%
scourge of political correctness and if
 
01:44:53.870 --> 01:44:53.880 align:start position:0%
I know that championing champion
 
01:44:57.950 --> 01:44:57.960 align:start position:0%
championing diversity is the cause celeb
 
01:45:00.669 --> 01:45:00.679 align:start position:0%
in the academic world as to all things
 
01:45:03.910 --> 01:45:03.920 align:start position:0%
but one that exception being diversity
 
01:45:07.750 --> 01:45:07.760 align:start position:0%
of thought and if I know that HB 1305
 
01:45:09.550 --> 01:45:09.560 align:start position:0%
enhances freedom of expression and
 
01:45:11.870 --> 01:45:11.880 align:start position:0%
freedom of Association on our Public
 
01:45:14.109 --> 01:45:14.119 align:start position:0%

if I know that this bill does not and
 
01:45:29.830 --> 01:45:29.840 align:start position:0%

Speaker those who support HB
 
01:51:23.270 --> 01:51:23.280 align:start position:0%
1311 refer to it euphemistically as as
 
01:51:26.270 --> 01:51:26.280 align:start position:0%
the freedom to read bill it requires

school districts to adopt policies

effectively ban all book bans encourage

intellectual freedom and discourage

discrimination this all sounds wonderful
 
01:51:47.669 --> 01:51:47.679 align:start position:0%
until you look more deeply into what
 
01:51:51.510 --> 01:51:51.520 align:start position:0%
this bill really does HB 1311 makes it
 
01:51:53.950 --> 01:51:53.960 align:start position:0%
impossible for local school boards to
 
01:51:57.069 --> 01:51:57.079 align:start position:0%
remove material that parents subject to
 
01:52:01.390 --> 01:52:01.400 align:start position:0%
a 2017 article on the American Library

association's intellectual Freedom blog
 
01:52:07.669 --> 01:52:07.679 align:start position:0%
emphasizes one of the basic ideas from
 
01:52:11.910 --> 01:52:11.920 align:start position:0%

of Education versus
 
01:52:17.189 --> 01:52:17.199 align:start position:0%

responsible for supervising the
 
01:52:21.910 --> 01:52:21.920 align:start position:0%
education of students who are in their
 
01:52:27.069 --> 01:52:27.079 align:start position:0%
care and can remove materials deemed
 
01:52:30.470 --> 01:52:30.480 align:start position:0%
educationally unsuitable or pervasively
 
01:52:33.069 --> 01:52:33.079 align:start position:0%
vulgar those last two phrases are from
 
01:52:36.149 --> 01:52:36.159 align:start position:0%
the actual Supreme Court decision so
 
01:52:40.030 --> 01:52:40.040 align:start position:0%
let's stop calling every removal of a
 
01:52:42.790 --> 01:52:42.800 align:start position:0%
book from a library a book
 
01:52:45.830 --> 01:52:45.840 align:start position:0%
ban this term is misused when describing
 
01:52:48.109 --> 01:52:48.119 align:start position:0%
this bill because removing a book from
 
01:52:50.229 --> 01:52:50.239 align:start position:0%
the relatively small sort of collections
 
01:52:53.069 --> 01:52:53.079 align:start position:0%
in public school libraries and action
 
01:52:55.109 --> 01:52:55.119 align:start position:0%
that both the Pico case and this article
 
01:52:58.069 --> 01:52:58.079 align:start position:0%
on the Ala website affirm is sometimes

01:53:26.990 --> 01:53:27.000 align:start position:0%
hypothetically justify the inclusion of

a blind author's treaties on the joys of

pedophilia because of his physical
 
01:53:36.310 --> 01:53:36.320 align:start position:0%

01:53:38.589 --> 01:53:38.599 align:start position:0%
freedom to read Bild really requires
 
01:53:40.350 --> 01:53:40.360 align:start position:0%
isn't anything Go's collection
 
01:53:42.990 --> 01:53:43.000 align:start position:0%
development policy that abuses true
 
01:53:45.790 --> 01:53:45.800 align:start position:0%
Freedom Frederick Douglas asserted that
 
01:53:49.830 --> 01:53:49.840 align:start position:0%
learning to read makes a person forever

free the freedom that he referred to
 
01:53:54.790 --> 01:53:54.800 align:start position:0%
does not hinge on the ability of a child
 
01:53:57.709 --> 01:53:57.719 align:start position:0%
to access books that are as the Supreme

prohibits the removal of Library
 
01:54:12.030 --> 01:54:12.040 align:start position:0%
material on the basis of viewpoint so
 
01:54:13.790 --> 01:54:13.800 align:start position:0%
actually the author in the previous
 
01:54:15.470 --> 01:54:15.480 align:start position:0%
example wouldn't even have to be
 
01:54:17.149 --> 01:54:17.159 align:start position:0%
disabled because his opinions on
 
01:54:19.830 --> 01:54:19.840 align:start position:0%
pedophilia would be protected simply
 
01:54:22.510 --> 01:54:22.520 align:start position:0%
because they were his viewpoint
 
01:54:26.589 --> 01:54:26.599 align:start position:0%

for
 
01:54:40.310 --> 01:54:40.320 align:start position:0%
reconsideration because the author's
 
01:54:42.510 --> 01:54:42.520 align:start position:0%
Viewpoint is that all readers should
 
01:54:45.189 --> 01:54:45.199 align:start position:0%
have easy access to information on how
 
01:54:47.310 --> 01:54:47.320 align:start position:0%
to kill
 
01:54:50.310 --> 01:54:50.320 align:start position:0%
themselves freedom to read should not
 
01:54:52.790 --> 01:54:52.800 align:start position:0%
mean anything goes it should not mean
 
01:54:55.069 --> 01:54:55.079 align:start position:0%
that books considered objectionable can
 
01:54:58.149 --> 01:54:58.159 align:start position:0%
never be removed freedom is actually
 
01:55:01.229 --> 01:55:01.239 align:start position:0%
being denied by this so-called freedom
 
01:55:05.030 --> 01:55:05.040 align:start position:0%
to read bill the freedom of parents to
 
01:55:08.390 --> 01:55:08.400 align:start position:0%
object to a book and have that objection
 
01:55:11.310 --> 01:55:11.320 align:start position:0%
seriously considered not discounted and
 
01:55:13.709 --> 01:55:13.719 align:start position:0%
undermined by Twisted logic that judges
 
01:55:16.189 --> 01:55:16.199 align:start position:0%
a book by the identity of its authors
 
01:55:18.950 --> 01:55:18.960 align:start position:0%
and characters rather than on the
 
01:55:22.870 --> 01:55:22.880 align:start position:0%
content of its Pages since HB 13 11
 
01:55:25.790 --> 01:55:25.800 align:start position:0%

the problem of children's exposure to
 
01:55:30.149 --> 01:55:30.159 align:start position:0%
harmful Library material and only makes

bipartisan Common Sense bill which takes

a balanced approach in upholding all of
 
01:57:12.030 --> 01:57:12.040 align:start position:0%
these shared goals and I ask for your
 
01:57:14.830 --> 01:57:14.840 align:start position:0%
support under this legislation districts
 
01:57:16.990 --> 01:57:17.000 align:start position:0%

criteria staff will use When selecting

books and other materials for the
 
01:57:32.030 --> 01:57:32.040 align:start position:0%

01:57:35.149 --> 01:57:35.159 align:start position:0%
include curricular fit authoritativeness

appropriateness
 
01:57:44.709 --> 01:57:44.719 align:start position:0%

01:57:44.719 --> 01:57:46.390 align:start position:0%
second the bill requires a
reconsideration

01:57:46.390 --> 01:57:46.400 align:start position:0%
reconsideration
 
01:57:49.390 --> 01:57:49.400 align:start position:0%
policy which describes the process that
 
01:57:51.669 --> 01:57:51.679 align:start position:0%
the school will follow when addressing
 
01:57:54.229 --> 01:57:54.239 align:start position:0%
parent requests to remove
 
01:57:56.430 --> 01:57:56.440 align:start position:0%
materials these policies are already
 
01:57:58.310 --> 01:57:58.320 align:start position:0%
widely recognized as best practice in
 
01:58:00.430 --> 01:58:00.440 align:start position:0%
school librarianship and they will
 
01:58:02.510 --> 01:58:02.520 align:start position:0%
simply be required rather than
 
01:58:05.350 --> 01:58:05.360 align:start position:0%
recommended should this bill
 
01:58:07.709 --> 01:58:07.719 align:start position:0%
pass these two policies must be in

Hampshire law against
 
01:58:12.950 --> 01:58:12.960 align:start position:0%
discrimination this includes ensuring
 
01:58:17.790 --> 01:58:17.800 align:start position:0%
that policies do not exclude books based
 
01:58:20.310 --> 01:58:20.320 align:start position:0%
solely on an author or subject's
 
01:58:22.430 --> 01:58:22.440 align:start position:0%
identity within a protected class such
 
01:58:25.030 --> 01:58:25.040 align:start position:0%
as race or sexual
 
01:58:28.310 --> 01:58:28.320 align:start position:0%
orientation but to be crystal
 
01:58:32.470 --> 01:58:32.480 align:start position:0%
clear this does not mean as some have
 
01:58:34.790 --> 01:58:34.800 align:start position:0%
argued that a book with a black
 
01:58:37.270 --> 01:58:37.280 align:start position:0%
character or a gay character or a blind
 
01:58:40.030 --> 01:58:40.040 align:start position:0%
character could never be removed for any
 
01:58:43.069 --> 01:58:43.079 align:start position:0%
reason merely that it cannot be removed
 
01:58:46.350 --> 01:58:46.360 align:start position:0%
because of their
 
01:58:48.950 --> 01:58:48.960 align:start position:0%
identity this provision recognizes that
 
01:58:50.990 --> 01:58:51.000 align:start position:0%
while many requests for removal are made
 
01:58:52.629 --> 01:58:52.639 align:start position:0%
in good faith
 
01:58:54.229 --> 01:58:54.239 align:start position:0%
others have been made with the goal of
 
01:58:56.750 --> 01:58:56.760 align:start position:0%
removing diverse perspectives from the

Speaker if I know that no material
 
02:05:28.870 --> 02:05:28.880 align:start position:0%
should be selected for a school library
 
02:05:32.430 --> 02:05:32.440 align:start position:0%
or prevented from removal based on
 
02:05:34.830 --> 02:05:34.840 align:start position:0%
characteristics or identity of the

author or
 
02:05:39.390 --> 02:05:39.400 align:start position:0%
subject if I know that a child should be
 
02:05:42.390 --> 02:05:42.400 align:start position:0%
protected from obscene material instead
 
02:05:46.910 --> 02:05:46.920 align:start position:0%
of granting them the freedom to read it
 
02:05:49.790 --> 02:05:49.800 align:start position:0%
and if I know that this bill would do
 
02:05:52.990 --> 02:05:53.000 align:start position:0%
nothing but cement obscene material
 
02:05:55.950 --> 02:05:55.960 align:start position:0%
right into the school libraries but is
 
02:05:59.109 --> 02:05:59.119 align:start position:0%
masquerading as a solution then would I

heard thank you
 
03:29:12.429 --> 03:29:12.439 align:start position:0%
again the word fear is sometimes viewed
 
03:29:16.710 --> 03:29:16.720 align:start position:0%
as an acronym false evidence appearing
 
03:29:19.269 --> 03:29:19.279 align:start position:0%
Real This Acronym describes how our
 
03:29:22.349 --> 03:29:22.359 align:start position:0%
minds can weave together false Tales of
 
03:29:25.590 --> 03:29:25.600 align:start position:0%
how situations might turn out as I
 
03:29:27.349 --> 03:29:27.359 align:start position:0%
described the adverse
 
03:29:31.189 --> 03:29:31.199 align:start position:0%
consequences we should expect if HB 1312
 
03:29:34.750 --> 03:29:34.760 align:start position:0%
passes please consider if your position
 
03:29:38.150 --> 03:29:38.160 align:start position:0%
is determined by fear rather than by
 
03:29:41.590 --> 03:29:41.600 align:start position:0%
facts HB 13312 is unnecessary
 
03:29:43.990 --> 03:29:44.000 align:start position:0%
legislation created by fear of the
 
03:29:47.150 --> 03:29:47.160 align:start position:0%
unfamiliar or unknown this bill would
 
03:29:49.389 --> 03:29:49.399 align:start position:0%
cause censoring in health education
 
03:29:52.030 --> 03:29:52.040 align:start position:0%
classes and in all other instruction and
 
03:29:55.150 --> 03:29:55.160 align:start position:0%
curriculum that reference lgbtq
 
03:29:57.910 --> 03:29:57.920 align:start position:0%
people it could apply to books assigned
 
03:30:00.389 --> 03:30:00.399 align:start position:0%
in history class on women achieving the
 
03:30:03.389 --> 03:30:03.399 align:start position:0%
right to vote on marriage equality on
 
03:30:07.030 --> 03:30:07.040 align:start position:0%
the Stonewall Uprising and so much more
 
03:30:09.990 --> 03:30:10.000 align:start position:0%
the very broad scope of 1312 would
 
03:30:13.229 --> 03:30:13.239 align:start position:0%
severely impair thorough honest
 
03:30:16.710 --> 03:30:16.720 align:start position:0%
education thus harming all students
 
03:30:19.229 --> 03:30:19.239 align:start position:0%
it is completely
 
03:30:22.030 --> 03:30:22.040 align:start position:0%
impractical many of us could share our
 
03:30:24.990 --> 03:30:25.000 align:start position:0%
stories of first learning that a family
 
03:30:27.269 --> 03:30:27.279 align:start position:0%
member or friend has a different gender
 
03:30:29.910 --> 03:30:29.920 align:start position:0%
identity than the familiar
 
03:30:32.910 --> 03:30:32.920 align:start position:0%
heterosexual how we move from Fear
 
03:30:35.030 --> 03:30:35.040 align:start position:0%
concern and
 
03:30:37.469 --> 03:30:37.479 align:start position:0%
uncertainty to recognizing that we are
 
03:30:40.469 --> 03:30:40.479 align:start position:0%
all just people trying to live our best
 
03:30:44.670 --> 03:30:44.680 align:start position:0%
lives is a complex multi-chapter journey
 
03:30:48.070 --> 03:30:48.080 align:start position:0%
I believe the supporters of HB 1312 live
 
03:30:49.990 --> 03:30:50.000 align:start position:0%
in fear of harm by those who are
 
03:30:53.590 --> 03:30:53.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:57.830 --> 03:30:57.840 align:start position:0%
them but the real harm from 1312 is that
 
03:30:59.870 --> 03:30:59.880 align:start position:0%
it interferes with the ability of our
 
03:31:02.870 --> 03:31:02.880 align:start position:0%
professional Educators to provide valid
 
03:31:05.469 --> 03:31:05.479 align:start position:0%
comprehensive curriculum as well as to
 
03:31:08.229 --> 03:31:08.239 align:start position:0%
support teens throughout their growth
 
03:31:10.990 --> 03:31:11.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire education statutes already
 
03:31:13.590 --> 03:31:13.600 align:start position:0%
require schools to provide parents with
 
03:31:16.150 --> 03:31:16.160 align:start position:0%
a two-e advance notice of curriculum
 
03:31:18.389 --> 03:31:18.399 align:start position:0%
course materials dealing with human
 
03:31:21.429 --> 03:31:21.439 align:start position:0%
sexuality parents already have the
 
03:31:23.150 --> 03:31:23.160 align:start position:0%
option to remove their child from
 
03:31:25.309 --> 03:31:25.319 align:start position:0%
instruction and course material they
 
03:31:25.319 --> 03:31:26.469 align:start position:0%
instruction and course material they
consider

03:31:26.469 --> 03:31:26.479 align:start position:0%
consider
 
03:31:29.750 --> 03:31:29.760 align:start position:0%
objectionable schools already respect
 
03:31:31.429 --> 03:31:31.439 align:start position:0%
that parents should be involved in their
 
03:31:34.750 --> 03:31:34.760 align:start position:0%
children's education and want them to
 
03:31:37.389 --> 03:31:37.399 align:start position:0%
participate School Personnel do
 
03:31:40.269 --> 03:31:40.279 align:start position:0%
encourage students to directly talk with
 
03:31:43.710 --> 03:31:43.720 align:start position:0%
parents but mandating disclosure taking
 
03:31:46.830 --> 03:31:46.840 align:start position:0%
away discretion is harmful to those very
 
03:31:48.510 --> 03:31:48.520 align:start position:0%
students we want to
 
03:31:50.950 --> 03:31:50.960 align:start position:0%
support the divisive and dangerous
 
03:31:53.670 --> 03:31:53.680 align:start position:0%
ramifications of this bill are
 
03:31:56.990 --> 03:31:57.000 align:start position:0%
many respecting gender education does
 
03:31:59.510 --> 03:31:59.520 align:start position:0%
not erase people that you don't
 
03:32:03.189 --> 03:32:03.199 align:start position:0%
understand or prefer rather it sends the
 
03:32:05.150 --> 03:32:05.160 align:start position:0%
message that the feelings and identities
 
03:32:08.030 --> 03:32:08.040 align:start position:0%
of Youth are to be shunned feared and
 
03:32:11.670 --> 03:32:11.680 align:start position:0%
potentially even censored very sadly and
 
03:32:14.990 --> 03:32:15.000 align:start position:0%
most unkindly it would Short change all
 
03:32:17.950 --> 03:32:17.960 align:start position:0%
of us from the opportunities to better
 
03:32:19.269 --> 03:32:19.279 align:start position:0%
understand and
 
03:32:22.710 --> 03:32:22.720 align:start position:0%
connect HB 1312 proposes a new section
 
03:32:24.830 --> 03:32:24.840 align:start position:0%
of law dealing with the emotional
 
03:32:27.830 --> 03:32:27.840 align:start position:0%
well-being and mental health of students
 
03:32:31.070 --> 03:32:31.080 align:start position:0%

their child schools however cannot fully

notice the second thing the amended Bill
 
03:34:54.910 --> 03:34:54.920 align:start position:0%
does is to prohibit districts from
 
03:34:58.550 --> 03:34:58.560 align:start position:0%
adopting policies that would prevent
 
03:35:01.710 --> 03:35:01.720 align:start position:0%
schools from answering a parents
 
03:35:04.590 --> 03:35:04.600 align:start position:0%
question about their child's emotional
 
03:35:08.030 --> 03:35:08.040 align:start position:0%
or physical health sexuality or a change

in their
 
03:35:11.910 --> 03:35:11.920 align:start position:0%
services don't parents have a right to
 
03:35:15.229 --> 03:35:15.239 align:start position:0%
know do we want School staff withholding
 
03:35:15.239 --> 03:35:16.189 align:start position:0%
know do we want School staff withholding
answers

03:35:16.189 --> 03:35:16.199 align:start position:0%
answers
 
03:35:19.870 --> 03:35:19.880 align:start position:0%
from parents keeping secrets if you will
 
03:35:21.590 --> 03:35:21.600 align:start position:0%
whose kids are they
 
03:35:24.070 --> 03:35:24.080 align:start position:0%
anyway any policy that would keep
 
03:35:27.229 --> 03:35:27.239 align:start position:0%
answers from parents is destructive it
 
03:35:29.269 --> 03:35:29.279 align:start position:0%
would destroy the relationship between
 
03:35:31.670 --> 03:35:31.680 align:start position:0%
parents and child and it would also
 
03:35:34.630 --> 03:35:34.640 align:start position:0%
destroy trust between parents and
 
03:35:37.750 --> 03:35:37.760 align:start position:0%
schools this should not be hard just
 
03:35:40.830 --> 03:35:40.840 align:start position:0%
tell parents the truth when they ask
 
03:35:43.870 --> 03:35:43.880 align:start position:0%
simple there is a protection in the
 
03:35:47.950 --> 03:35:47.960 align:start position:0%
bill if Al providing this
 
03:35:51.150 --> 03:35:51.160 align:start position:0%
information a reasonably a reasonably
 
03:35:52.710 --> 03:35:52.720 align:start position:0%
prudent person would believe that
 
03:35:55.590 --> 03:35:55.600 align:start position:0%
disclosure would lead to abuse or
 
03:35:59.389 --> 03:35:59.399 align:start position:0%
neglect they could withhold that
 
03:36:01.630 --> 03:36:01.640 align:start position:0%
information the opposing committee
 
03:36:04.389 --> 03:36:04.399 align:start position:0%
report states that this bill is divisive
 
03:36:04.399 --> 03:36:05.469 align:start position:0%
report states that this bill is divisive
and

03:36:05.469 --> 03:36:05.479 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:36:08.910 --> 03:36:08.920 align:start position:0%
dangerous dangerous for who for the
 
03:36:11.429 --> 03:36:11.439 align:start position:0%
relationship between the child and the
 
03:36:14.590 --> 03:36:14.600 align:start position:0%
parent and the family I asked a moment
 
03:36:18.070 --> 03:36:18.080 align:start position:0%
ago who children are they anyway well I
 
03:36:20.349 --> 03:36:20.359 align:start position:0%
believe that some want to insert the
 
03:36:22.510 --> 03:36:22.520 align:start position:0%
government into a parenting uh into a
 
03:36:22.520 --> 03:36:23.590 align:start position:0%

03:36:23.590 --> 03:36:23.600 align:start position:0%

03:36:26.710 --> 03:36:26.720 align:start position:0%
role we heard that there should be a
 
03:36:30.229 --> 03:36:30.239 align:start position:0%
trusted adult at school but evidently
 
03:36:31.189 --> 03:36:31.199 align:start position:0%
not at
 
03:36:34.750 --> 03:36:34.760 align:start position:0%
home it's very simple let parents know
 
03:36:36.670 --> 03:36:36.680 align:start position:0%
when instructions to be given about
 
03:36:39.910 --> 03:36:39.920 align:start position:0%
sexuality gender and identity and
 
03:36:43.469 --> 03:36:43.479 align:start position:0%
secondly just tell parents the truth
 
03:36:49.630 --> 03:36:49.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:51.590 --> 03:36:51.600 align:start position:0%

inquiry thank you Mr
 
03:38:07.229 --> 03:38:07.239 align:start position:0%
Speaker if I know that HB 1312 goes far
 
03:38:11.229 --> 03:38:11.239 align:start position:0%
beyond just amending curriculum policy
 
03:38:13.910 --> 03:38:13.920 align:start position:0%
notifications and timelines for
 
03:38:16.469 --> 03:38:16.479 align:start position:0%
parents and if I know that under the new
 
03:38:19.070 --> 03:38:19.080 align:start position:0%
section that was written that if for
 
03:38:21.950 --> 03:38:21.960 align:start position:0%
example High School teenager student
 
03:38:24.550 --> 03:38:24.560 align:start position:0%
came to me as his teacher or coach to
 
03:38:26.990 --> 03:38:27.000 align:start position:0%
discuss any questions about any issue of
 
03:38:29.790 --> 03:38:29.800 align:start position:0%
importance to them that may range from
 
03:38:33.469 --> 03:38:33.479 align:start position:0%
date rape to hazing soliciting relevant
 
03:38:36.429 --> 03:38:36.439 align:start position:0%
information I am forbidden to say why
 
03:38:38.429 --> 03:38:38.439 align:start position:0%
don't you just think it over before you
 
03:38:41.950 --> 03:38:41.960 align:start position:0%
make a decision and if I know that under
 
03:38:45.110 --> 03:38:45.120 align:start position:0%
this law I would be restricted from
 
03:38:47.309 --> 03:38:47.319 align:start position:0%
suggest suggesting to that student that
 
03:38:48.910 --> 03:38:48.920 align:start position:0%
maybe they should discuss that with a
 
03:38:50.710 --> 03:38:50.720 align:start position:0%
guidance counselor a school social
 
03:38:53.429 --> 03:38:53.439 align:start position:0%
worker medical doctor or perhaps a
 
03:38:56.349 --> 03:38:56.359 align:start position:0%
professional from their particular Faith
 
03:38:58.950 --> 03:38:58.960 align:start position:0%
then knowing all this to be true I ask
 
03:39:00.630 --> 03:39:00.640 align:start position:0%
the members of this house to press the
 
03:39:03.070 --> 03:39:03.080 align:start position:0%

responsibility of caring for and about
 
03:39:24.349 --> 03:39:24.359 align:start position:0%
their children and if I know this is
 
03:39:26.910 --> 03:39:26.920 align:start position:0%
very difficult to do if they're not
 
03:39:29.630 --> 03:39:29.640 align:start position:0%
informed of what's going on with and
 
03:39:32.710 --> 03:39:32.720 align:start position:0%
what's being taught to their children
 
03:39:35.429 --> 03:39:35.439 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr

Speaker an attack or guard
 
03:41:31.110 --> 03:41:31.120 align:start position:0%
rail supporters of this bill view it as
 
03:41:33.750 --> 03:41:33.760 align:start position:0%
a guard rail for a program that has been
 
03:41:37.229 --> 03:41:37.239 align:start position:0%
over budgeted I beg to differ this has
 
03:41:40.309 --> 03:41:40.319 align:start position:0%
been a very successful program demand
 
03:41:44.070 --> 03:41:44.080 align:start position:0%
has outpaced the budget estimates Su
 
03:41:46.950 --> 03:41:46.960 align:start position:0%
successful in in that almost 5,000
 
03:41:50.149 --> 03:41:50.159 align:start position:0%
students already take advantage of the
 
03:41:52.910 --> 03:41:52.920 align:start position:0%
program successful in that parents find
 
03:41:55.590 --> 03:41:55.600 align:start position:0%
it beneficial to their children as
 
03:41:57.750 --> 03:41:57.760 align:start position:0%
evidenced by the fact that stay students
 
03:41:59.710 --> 03:41:59.720 align:start position:0%
are staying in the program and not
 
03:42:03.750 --> 03:42:03.760 align:start position:0%
leaving to go back to their Public
 
03:42:08.429 --> 03:42:08.439 align:start position:0%
School 1512 would cap establishment of
 
03:42:12.389 --> 03:42:12.399 align:start position:0%
EFA Accounts at the amount in the banal
 
03:42:15.229 --> 03:42:15.239 align:start position:0%
budget there was testimony that if this
 
03:42:18.149 --> 03:42:18.159 align:start position:0%
cap was reached a warrant article could
 
03:42:21.070 --> 03:42:21.080 align:start position:0%
simply be drawn by the governor to put
 
03:42:23.309 --> 03:42:23.319 align:start position:0%
more money into the budget but that's
 
03:42:24.990 --> 03:42:25.000 align:start position:0%
not what the bill
 
03:42:28.750 --> 03:42:28.760 align:start position:0%
says the bill specifically says that any
 
03:42:32.469 --> 03:42:32.479 align:start position:0%
warrant cannot exceed the budgeted
 
03:42:35.429 --> 03:42:35.439 align:start position:0%
amount we always hear that the program
 
03:42:39.229 --> 03:42:39.239 align:start position:0%
exceeds budget each year well that
 
03:42:41.630 --> 03:42:41.640 align:start position:0%
budgeted amount is really just an
 
03:42:43.590 --> 03:42:43.600 align:start position:0%
estimate of the number of kids who are
 
03:42:46.269 --> 03:42:46.279 align:start position:0%
going to enroll in the program
 
03:42:49.830 --> 03:42:49.840 align:start position:0%
the number of kids who make a
 
03:42:52.630 --> 03:42:52.640 align:start position:0%
choice this is different than public
 
03:42:56.389 --> 03:42:56.399 align:start position:0%
schools which have zip code locked
 
03:42:58.510 --> 03:42:58.520 align:start position:0%
population maybe we should hold public
 
03:43:01.349 --> 03:43:01.359 align:start position:0%
schools to a budgeted amount
 
03:43:05.269 --> 03:43:05.279 align:start position:0%
also and think of it this way when more
 
03:43:08.309 --> 03:43:08.319 align:start position:0%
children take advantage of the E efas
 
03:43:11.110 --> 03:43:11.120 align:start position:0%
and the program amount
 
03:43:14.110 --> 03:43:14.120 align:start position:0%
increases doesn't that save taxpayers
 
03:43:14.120 --> 03:43:15.870 align:start position:0%
increases doesn't that save taxpayers
money

03:43:15.870 --> 03:43:15.880 align:start position:0%
money
 
03:43:19.110 --> 03:43:19.120 align:start position:0%
consider thank you uh consider the
 
03:43:21.670 --> 03:43:21.680 align:start position:0%
average EFA amount is about
 
03:43:24.429 --> 03:43:24.439 align:start position:0%
$5,200 while a public school student
 
03:43:27.870 --> 03:43:27.880 align:start position:0%
cost to taxpayers is about
 
03:43:30.750 --> 03:43:30.760 align:start position:0%
$22,000 this is not common core
 
03:43:33.950 --> 03:43:33.960 align:start position:0%
math so this bill places a hard cap on
 
03:43:36.429 --> 03:43:36.439 align:start position:0%
the program it places a limit on the
 
03:43:39.070 --> 03:43:39.080 align:start position:0%
number of kids who can take advantage of
 
03:43:41.189 --> 03:43:41.199 align:start position:0%
the program the number of kids who are
 
03:43:43.750 --> 03:43:43.760 align:start position:0%
trying to find an option for their
 
03:43:45.950 --> 03:43:45.960 align:start position:0%
education that meets their
 
03:43:49.110 --> 03:43:49.120 align:start position:0%
needs so you tell me is this an attack
 
03:43:51.630 --> 03:43:51.640 align:start position:0%
or a guard rail if you believe that
 
03:43:54.110 --> 03:43:54.120 align:start position:0%
every child deserves the education that

programs should the education Freedom
 
03:44:34.870 --> 03:44:34.880 align:start position:0%

State budgeted
 
03:44:38.710 --> 03:44:38.720 align:start position:0%
amount simple
 
03:44:41.269 --> 03:44:41.279 align:start position:0%
question in the first year of the

03:44:50.510 --> 03:44:50.520 align:start position:0%
$129,000 the actual cost was
 
03:44:50.520 --> 03:44:52.389 align:start position:0%
$129,000 the actual cost was
$8.1

03:44:52.389 --> 03:44:52.399 align:start position:0%
$8.1
 
03:44:56.910 --> 03:44:56.920 align:start position:0%
million or a $7.9 million over
 
03:45:01.309 --> 03:45:01.319 align:start position:0%
budget in the second year the budget was
 
03:45:01.319 --> 03:45:02.910 align:start position:0%

$3.2
 
03:45:06.710 --> 03:45:06.720 align:start position:0%
million and the actual cost was

03:45:08.309 --> 03:45:08.319 align:start position:0%
$14.7
 
03:45:12.990 --> 03:45:13.000 align:start position:0%
million or $1.5 million over
 
03:45:16.030 --> 03:45:16.040 align:start position:0%
budget the third-year budget was

million or 2.4 million over
 
03:45:29.550 --> 03:45:29.560 align:start position:0%
budget now these figures attest that
 
03:45:31.830 --> 03:45:31.840 align:start position:0%
over the past three years the program
 
03:45:34.870 --> 03:45:34.880 align:start position:0%

OTP and deja vu all over again
 
03:59:37.429 --> 03:59:37.439 align:start position:0%
originally I was going to look up my
 
03:59:39.469 --> 03:59:39.479 align:start position:0%
speech from two terms
 
03:59:42.349 --> 03:59:42.359 align:start position:0%
ago when this also came up and there's
 
03:59:44.790 --> 03:59:44.800 align:start position:0%
another one coming
 
03:59:47.790 --> 03:59:47.800 align:start position:0%
this amendment would this bill would
 
03:59:51.149 --> 03:59:51.159 align:start position:0%
create an unworkable solution it calls
 
03:59:53.469 --> 03:59:53.479 align:start position:0%
for Democrats Republicans and
 
03:59:56.550 --> 03:59:56.560 align:start position:0%
Independence where does one find an
 
03:59:58.870 --> 03:59:58.880 align:start position:0%
independent check the voting roles on
 
04:00:01.630 --> 04:00:01.640 align:start position:0%
how an independent voted in the primary
 
04:00:03.189 --> 04:00:03.199 align:start position:0%
then are they an
 
04:00:05.670 --> 04:00:05.680 align:start position:0%
independent or find someone that has
 
04:00:08.429 --> 04:00:08.439 align:start position:0%
never voted do you want them on a
 
04:00:10.830 --> 04:00:10.840 align:start position:0%
commission and in the past we have had
 
04:00:14.030 --> 04:00:14.040 align:start position:0%
census delayed by the federal government
 
04:00:15.950 --> 04:00:15.960 align:start position:0%
so in that case how can the commission
 
04:00:19.429 --> 04:00:19.439 align:start position:0%
deliver the findings in the time period
 
04:00:22.030 --> 04:00:22.040 align:start position:0%
specified how many times do we have to
 
04:00:23.630 --> 04:00:23.640 align:start position:0%
vote on a
 
04:00:26.309 --> 04:00:26.319 align:start position:0%
commission this has failed numerous
 
04:00:29.309 --> 04:00:29.319 align:start position:0%
times the current method is fine and the
 
04:00:31.429 --> 04:00:31.439 align:start position:0%
only problem that I've seen in the
 
04:00:34.710 --> 04:00:34.720 align:start position:0%
redistricting for the last three
 
04:00:38.750 --> 04:00:38.760 align:start position:0%
times is when the governor has
 
04:00:40.469 --> 04:00:40.479 align:start position:0%
interfered and where in the New
 
04:00:42.189 --> 04:00:42.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire constitution does it give the
 
04:00:44.389 --> 04:00:44.399 align:start position:0%
governor the power and then the Court's
 
04:00:47.950 --> 04:00:47.960 align:start position:0%
doing it and we keep hearing about Jerry
 
04:00:51.590 --> 04:00:51.600 align:start position:0%
mandering in the 16 years I've been here
 
04:00:54.189 --> 04:00:54.199 align:start position:0%
we have had equal numbers of Democrat
 
04:00:56.710 --> 04:00:56.720 align:start position:0%
and Republican majorities if we had
 
04:00:59.469 --> 04:00:59.479 align:start position:0%
jeram mandering that wouldn't happen
 
04:01:02.030 --> 04:01:02.040 align:start position:0%
Senate and Executive councils also keep
 
04:01:04.149 --> 04:01:04.159 align:start position:0%
changing but then congressional
 
04:01:07.349 --> 04:01:07.359 align:start position:0%
districts seem to be always the same so
 
04:01:10.950 --> 04:01:10.960 align:start position:0%
maybe there is so please vote red so we
 
04:01:14.750 --> 04:01:14.760 align:start position:0%
can move on thank you
 
04:01:21.630 --> 04:01:21.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:24.429 --> 04:01:24.439 align:start position:0%
mad thank you Mr
 
04:01:27.469 --> 04:01:27.479 align:start position:0%
Speaker the process we go through every
 
04:01:30.349 --> 04:01:30.359 align:start position:0%
10 years of drawing District boundaries
 
04:01:34.070 --> 04:01:34.080 align:start position:0%
should be a fair process one that people
 
04:01:36.389 --> 04:01:36.399 align:start position:0%
of all parties can agree to but the
 
04:01:38.550 --> 04:01:38.560 align:start position:0%
process that we have is not one that
 
04:01:42.990 --> 04:01:43.000 align:start position:0%
people consider Fair who likes a system
 
04:01:44.630 --> 04:01:44.640 align:start position:0%
where politicians
 
04:01:47.950 --> 04:01:47.960 align:start position:0%
draw electoral maps that benefit
 
04:01:51.630 --> 04:01:51.640 align:start position:0%
politicians the answer is only
 
04:01:55.229 --> 04:01:55.239 align:start position:0%
politicians voters do not like partisan
 
04:01:57.590 --> 04:01:57.600 align:start position:0%
Jerry mandering according to a recent
 
04:02:00.870 --> 04:02:00.880 align:start position:0%
poll taken after the last election 88%
 
04:02:02.070 --> 04:02:02.080 align:start position:0%
of trump
 
04:02:04.910 --> 04:02:04.920 align:start position:0%
voters do not like do not approve of
 
04:02:06.630 --> 04:02:06.640 align:start position:0%
partisan Jerry mandering almost a
 
04:02:10.389 --> 04:02:10.399 align:start position:0%
similar percentage of Biden voters
 
04:02:13.030 --> 04:02:13.040 align:start position:0%
reject partisan Jerry mandering it's one
 
04:02:14.870 --> 04:02:14.880 align:start position:0%
of the only issues
 
04:02:18.710 --> 04:02:18.720 align:start position:0%
that joins stalwart supporters of each
 
04:02:21.229 --> 04:02:21.239 align:start position:0%
of those
 
04:02:23.429 --> 04:02:23.439 align:start position:0%
candidates Jerry mandering is the kind
 
04:02:26.830 --> 04:02:26.840 align:start position:0%
of thing that turns ordinary citizens
 
04:02:30.870 --> 04:02:30.880 align:start position:0%
off to politics causes them to see the
 
04:02:36.710 --> 04:02:36.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:38.950 --> 04:02:38.960 align:start position:0%
unworthy in New
 
04:02:41.630 --> 04:02:41.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire it's resulted as the previous
 
04:02:44.309 --> 04:02:44.319 align:start position:0%
speaker just pointed out in Governor's
 
04:02:46.990 --> 04:02:47.000 align:start position:0%
vetoing Maps adopted by the legislature
 
04:02:51.030 --> 04:02:51.040 align:start position:0%
which was done in 2002 2012 and last
 
04:02:53.189 --> 04:02:53.199 align:start position:0%
time around it's resulted in courts
 
04:02:56.189 --> 04:02:56.199 align:start position:0%
drawing District boundaries instead of
 
04:02:56.199 --> 04:02:57.750 align:start position:0%
drawing District boundaries instead of
the

04:02:57.750 --> 04:02:57.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:02:59.870 --> 04:02:59.880 align:start position:0%
legislature it's not
 
04:03:02.030 --> 04:03:02.040 align:start position:0%
working it's not working in the eyes of
 
04:03:05.670 --> 04:03:05.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:08.269 --> 04:03:08.279 align:start position:0%
institutionally one defense of partisan
 
04:03:10.510 --> 04:03:10.520 align:start position:0%
Jerry mandering says
 
04:03:14.309 --> 04:03:14.319 align:start position:0%
this that there's no way to get partisan
 
04:03:14.319 --> 04:03:15.670 align:start position:0%
this that there's no way to get partisan
politics

04:03:15.670 --> 04:03:15.680 align:start position:0%
politics
 
04:03:18.630 --> 04:03:18.640 align:start position:0%
out of the business of drawing District
 
04:03:22.510 --> 04:03:22.520 align:start position:0%
boundaries so we might as well just let
 
04:03:25.429 --> 04:03:25.439 align:start position:0%
the politicians do their
 
04:03:29.070 --> 04:03:29.080 align:start position:0%
thing but there is a way there is an
 
04:03:32.710 --> 04:03:32.720 align:start position:0%
alternative it's called independent
 
04:03:35.030 --> 04:03:35.040 align:start position:0%
redistricting the word independent is a
 
04:03:35.040 --> 04:03:37.110 align:start position:0%
redistricting the word independent is a
slight

04:03:37.110 --> 04:03:37.120 align:start position:0%
slight
 
04:03:40.830 --> 04:03:40.840 align:start position:0%
misnomer we're not calling on the angels
 
04:03:43.990 --> 04:03:44.000 align:start position:0%
to come down from heaven and draw dis
 
04:03:47.710 --> 04:03:47.720 align:start position:0%
boundaries with platonic
 
04:03:51.229 --> 04:03:51.239 align:start position:0%
Perfection this is a human process it's
 
04:03:54.750 --> 04:03:54.760 align:start position:0%
a process where the goal is to get
 
04:03:57.510 --> 04:03:57.520 align:start position:0%
Democrats Republicans and independents
 
04:04:00.229 --> 04:04:00.239 align:start position:0%
to agree on District
 
04:04:03.590 --> 04:04:03.600 align:start position:0%
boundaries the idea is that it's
 
04:04:05.870 --> 04:04:05.880 align:start position:0%
possible to lay down the rules of
 
04:04:09.149 --> 04:04:09.159 align:start position:0%
democratic contestation of electoral
 
04:04:12.630 --> 04:04:12.640 align:start position:0%
contestation in a way that all the
 
04:04:16.429 --> 04:04:16.439 align:start position:0%
parties to the contest agree to just as
 
04:04:17.670 --> 04:04:17.680 align:start position:0%
it's possible at the beginning of a
 
04:04:19.469 --> 04:04:19.479 align:start position:0%
baseball game to have all the players
 
04:04:21.590 --> 04:04:21.600 align:start position:0%
agree to the rules of baseball before
 
04:04:23.630 --> 04:04:23.640 align:start position:0%
the game starts or before a game of
 
04:04:25.910 --> 04:04:25.920 align:start position:0%
chess to have the two rival players
 
04:04:28.149 --> 04:04:28.159 align:start position:0%
agree to the rules before they start
 
04:04:31.429 --> 04:04:31.439 align:start position:0%
playing it's possible in politics too to
 
04:04:33.870 --> 04:04:33.880 align:start position:0%
get basic rules of the game that all the
 
04:04:36.349 --> 04:04:36.359 align:start position:0%
contenders agree to and that's not
 
04:04:39.269 --> 04:04:39.279 align:start position:0%
Angelic Perfection that's just human
 
04:04:42.630 --> 04:04:42.640 align:start position:0%
fairness it's worth striving
 
04:04:42.640 --> 04:04:44.269 align:start position:0%
fairness it's worth striving
for

04:04:44.269 --> 04:04:44.279 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:04:46.790 --> 04:04:46.800 align:start position:0%
now if I'm wrong and the citizens of New
 
04:04:49.590 --> 04:04:49.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire want partisan Jerry
 
04:04:52.269 --> 04:04:52.279 align:start position:0%
mandering this bill gives them the
 
04:04:56.990 --> 04:04:57.000 align:start position:0%
chance to say so because this would just
 
04:04:59.790 --> 04:04:59.800 align:start position:0%
put the question to the citizenry it
 
04:05:03.070 --> 04:05:03.080 align:start position:0%
doesn't impose any policy on citizens it
 
04:05:05.910 --> 04:05:05.920 align:start position:0%
just gives them a chance to say yes or
 
04:05:10.110 --> 04:05:10.120 align:start position:0%
no to Independent redistricting give the
 
04:05:12.630 --> 04:05:12.640 align:start position:0%

Speaker and fellow uh Representatives Mr
 
04:06:53.630 --> 04:06:53.640 align:start position:0%
Speaker if I know that you can find
 
04:06:55.830 --> 04:06:55.840 align:start position:0%
examples of the best efforts to
 
04:06:58.149 --> 04:06:58.159 align:start position:0%
legislate the rules of the game to make
 
04:07:00.550 --> 04:07:00.560 align:start position:0%
it as Fair as possible and these
 
04:07:04.070 --> 04:07:04.080 align:start position:0%
attempts have given disastrous results
 
04:07:07.550 --> 04:07:07.560 align:start position:0%
if I know between the Court's approvals
 
04:07:09.830 --> 04:07:09.840 align:start position:0%
the governor's veto the special interest
 
04:07:12.110 --> 04:07:12.120 align:start position:0%
groups the special agencies that put
 
04:07:14.429 --> 04:07:14.439 align:start position:0%
influence there are already too many
 
04:07:17.389 --> 04:07:17.399 align:start position:0%
people involved with the redistricting
 
04:07:20.790 --> 04:07:20.800 align:start position:0%
process and finally if I know that this
 
04:07:22.830 --> 04:07:22.840 align:start position:0%
political process is clearly in the
 
04:07:25.870 --> 04:07:25.880 align:start position:0%
hands of us legislators no one else
 
04:07:27.550 --> 04:07:27.560 align:start position:0%

04:07:42.469 --> 04:07:42.479 align:start position:0%
inquiry thank you Mr Speaker if I know
 
04:07:44.870 --> 04:07:44.880 align:start position:0%
that most new Hamp sure voters were
 
04:07:46.990 --> 04:07:47.000 align:start position:0%
disillusioned with the process that we
 
04:07:48.670 --> 04:07:48.680 align:start position:0%
saw in
 
04:07:51.790 --> 04:07:51.800 align:start position:0%
2021 and support an independent
 
04:07:54.590 --> 04:07:54.600 align:start position:0%
redistricting commission and if I know
 
04:07:57.269 --> 04:07:57.279 align:start position:0%
that drawing maps that everyone can
 
04:08:00.750 --> 04:08:00.760 align:start position:0%
agree to and in a transparent way would
 
04:08:04.469 --> 04:08:04.479 align:start position:0%
serve the interest better for the voters
 
04:08:07.670 --> 04:08:07.680 align:start position:0%
and not the interest of us or our
 
04:08:10.950 --> 04:08:10.960 align:start position:0%
parties and if I know that we each
 
04:08:14.750 --> 04:08:14.760 align:start position:0%
represent constituents of both parties
 
04:08:17.950 --> 04:08:17.960 align:start position:0%
and took an oath to support the
 
04:08:22.469 --> 04:08:22.479 align:start position:0%
Constitution not our party then would I
 
04:08:25.229 --> 04:08:25.239 align:start position:0%
push the green button to allow the
 
04:08:28.630 --> 04:08:28.640 align:start position:0%

substantially Sim similar the changer
 
04:13:21.910 --> 04:13:21.920 align:start position:0%
the chamber can vote to accept it we
 
04:13:23.550 --> 04:13:23.560 align:start position:0%
would put the question to the body we
 
04:13:25.030 --> 04:13:25.040 align:start position:0%
put the yeah we put the question to the
 
04:13:27.309 --> 04:13:27.319 align:start position:0%
body we would take two3 to introduce
 
04:13:29.830 --> 04:13:29.840 align:start position:0%
two-thirds so if I heard you
 
04:13:31.830 --> 04:13:31.840 align:start position:0%
correctly if the language was
 
04:13:33.990 --> 04:13:34.000 align:start position:0%
substantially similar regarding an

substantially similar regarding an
annual

04:13:35.950 --> 04:13:35.960 align:start position:0%
annual
 
04:13:37.950 --> 04:13:37.960 align:start position:0%
certification then the question would be
 
04:13:40.710 --> 04:13:40.720 align:start position:0%
put to the body and unless 2/3 voted for
 
04:13:43.870 --> 04:13:43.880 align:start position:0%
it that would stop this correct
 
04:13:45.429 --> 04:13:45.439 align:start position:0%
yes thank
 
04:13:47.710 --> 04:13:47.720 align:start position:0%
you committee on Election law to which
 
04:13:49.990 --> 04:13:50.000 align:start position:0%
was referred House Bill 1146 relative
 
04:13:51.429 --> 04:13:51.439 align:start position:0%
the removal of a voter from the
 
04:13:55.790 --> 04:13:55.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:57.670 --> 04:13:57.680 align:start position:0%
recommendation representative Barry
 
04:13:59.630 --> 04:13:59.640 align:start position:0%
moves ought to
 
04:14:06.990 --> 04:14:07.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:09.950 --> 04:14:09.960 align:start position:0%
rafter thank you Mr
 
04:14:13.109 --> 04:14:13.119 align:start position:0%
chair if I know that this bill is unne
 
04:14:16.269 --> 04:14:16.279 align:start position:0%
necessary because virtually no voters
 
04:14:18.950 --> 04:14:18.960 align:start position:0%
request removal from the checklist and
 
04:14:20.750 --> 04:14:20.760 align:start position:0%
if I know that voters are already
 
04:14:22.550 --> 04:14:22.560 align:start position:0%
removed from the checklist when they
 
04:14:25.229 --> 04:14:25.239 align:start position:0%
register in another district and if I
 
04:14:27.030 --> 04:14:27.040 align:start position:0%
know that this would allow a voter to
 
04:14:29.269 --> 04:14:29.279 align:start position:0%
remove their name immediately after an
 
04:14:31.269 --> 04:14:31.279 align:start position:0%
election which could make it more
 
04:14:33.349 --> 04:14:33.359 align:start position:0%
difficult to reconcile a vote or verify
 
04:14:36.830 --> 04:14:36.840 align:start position:0%
a voter then would I vote would I press
 
04:14:39.030 --> 04:14:39.040 align:start position:0%
the red button so another motion could
 
04:14:42.030 --> 04:14:42.040 align:start position:0%
be made thank
 
04:14:45.750 --> 04:14:45.760 align:start position:0%
you this is going to be a division vote
 
04:14:47.309 --> 04:14:47.319 align:start position:0%
I made the mistake of not announcing
 
04:14:49.229 --> 04:14:49.239 align:start position:0%
that at first this is a division vote
 
04:14:50.990 --> 04:14:51.000 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes representative void for

Mr speaker thank you again Mr Speaker if
 
04:15:01.030 --> 04:15:01.040 align:start position:0%
I know that in 2021 a quarter million
 
04:15:03.990 --> 04:15:04.000 align:start position:0%
voters names no longer eligible to vote
 
04:15:05.990 --> 04:15:06.000 align:start position:0%
were removed from the checklist that
 
04:15:08.389 --> 04:15:08.399 align:start position:0%
took 10 years to accumulate because
 
04:15:10.630 --> 04:15:10.640 align:start position:0%
there's no other way to remove them and
 
04:15:13.510 --> 04:15:13.520 align:start position:0%
if I know that when you move to another
 
04:15:16.349 --> 04:15:16.359 align:start position:0%
town There's no way to guarantee that
 
04:15:18.830 --> 04:15:18.840 align:start position:0%
your name will be removed from the voter
 
04:15:21.710 --> 04:15:21.720 align:start position:0%

know that supervisors of the checklist
 
04:18:56.389 --> 04:18:56.399 align:start position:0%
are opposed to this bill because it's it
 
04:19:00.109 --> 04:19:00.119 align:start position:0%
is prescriptive and yields no apparent
 
04:19:03.309 --> 04:19:03.319 align:start position:0%

04:19:06.790 --> 04:19:06.800 align:start position:0%
supervisors already meet at a Cadence
 
04:19:08.550 --> 04:19:08.560 align:start position:0%

inquiry thank you Mr Speaker Mr
 
04:28:57.269 --> 04:28:57.279 align:start position:0%
Speaker if I know that there was no
 
04:28:59.189 --> 04:28:59.199 align:start position:0%
valid testimony in support of the
 
04:29:02.550 --> 04:29:02.560 align:start position:0%
original bill it was really testimony
 
04:29:04.510 --> 04:29:04.520 align:start position:0%
that was completely untethered from
 
04:29:08.790 --> 04:29:08.800 align:start position:0%
reality and was an insult to our entire
 
04:29:10.950 --> 04:29:10.960 align:start position:0%
system of election Administration
 
04:29:12.830 --> 04:29:12.840 align:start position:0%
ranging from the secretary of State down
 
04:29:16.469 --> 04:29:16.479 align:start position:0%
to our hardworking local moderators and
 
04:29:19.349 --> 04:29:19.359 align:start position:0%
clerks and if I also know that the face
 
04:29:21.269 --> 04:29:21.279 align:start position:0%
saving amendment to this bill also
 
04:29:23.670 --> 04:29:23.680 align:start position:0%
provides an unsatisfactory solution to
 
04:29:27.550 --> 04:29:27.560 align:start position:0%
an improbable Nyon impossible situation
 
04:29:29.309 --> 04:29:29.319 align:start position:0%
that has never occurred in New Hampshire
 
04:29:31.950 --> 04:29:31.960 align:start position:0%
and that frankly it never could occur
 
04:29:33.910 --> 04:29:33.920 align:start position:0%
and if I know that this
 
04:29:36.910 --> 04:29:36.920 align:start position:0%
unsatisfactory imaginary situation is
 
04:29:39.149 --> 04:29:39.159 align:start position:0%
amazingly enough already addressed in
 
04:29:42.070 --> 04:29:42.080 align:start position:0%
statute rendering this bill both
 
04:29:45.030 --> 04:29:45.040 align:start position:0%
redundant and unnecessary but I now

press the red button to overturn the OTP
 
04:29:50.349 --> 04:29:50.359 align:start position:0%

if I know that part two article 32 of

our constitution requires a fair record
 
04:30:10.670 --> 04:30:10.680 align:start position:0%
of votes and if I know that this bill
 
04:30:12.910 --> 04:30:12.920 align:start position:0%
allows for a recount when it is
 
04:30:15.670 --> 04:30:15.680 align:start position:0%
mathematically impossible that either
 
04:30:17.389 --> 04:30:17.399 align:start position:0%
there was a fair record of the votes or
 
04:30:19.790 --> 04:30:19.800 align:start position:0%
that only qualified voters voted and if
 
04:30:22.389 --> 04:30:22.399 align:start position:0%
I know that I want to ensure that we
 
04:30:25.030 --> 04:30:25.040 align:start position:0%

04:38:12.029 --> 04:38:12.039 align:start position:0%
inquiry thank you Mr Speaker and fellow
 
04:38:14.109 --> 04:38:14.119 align:start position:0%
Representatives if I know that more
 
04:38:17.310 --> 04:38:17.320 align:start position:0%
frequent voter roll purges leads to more
 
04:38:19.470 --> 04:38:19.480 align:start position:0%
disenfranchised voters and that the
 
04:38:22.189 --> 04:38:22.199 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State suggested doing a
 
04:38:25.349 --> 04:38:25.359 align:start position:0%
six-year Purge instead of a 4-year and
 
04:38:28.789 --> 04:38:28.799 align:start position:0%
if I know that 30-day notices of removal
 
04:38:31.551 --> 04:38:31.561 align:start position:0%
from the checklist are not always
 
04:38:35.510 --> 04:38:35.520 align:start position:0%
received uh by voters and if I know that
 
04:38:37.709 --> 04:38:37.719 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire could join a shared
 
04:38:41.789 --> 04:38:41.799 align:start position:0%
database like Eric to update voter roles
 
04:38:44.470 --> 04:38:44.480 align:start position:0%
that could handle this issue better then
 
04:38:46.429 --> 04:38:46.439 align:start position:0%
I would press the red button so a better
 
04:38:48.590 --> 04:38:48.600 align:start position:0%

04:38:50.910 --> 04:38:50.920 align:start position:0%
you representative where is recognized
 
04:38:53.189 --> 04:38:53.199 align:start position:0%

04:38:55.990 --> 04:38:56.000 align:start position:0%
inquiry thank you Mr Speaker honorable
 
04:38:58.429 --> 04:38:58.439 align:start position:0%
colleagues if I know that the 2021 voter
 
04:39:01.670 --> 04:39:01.680 align:start position:0%
verification effort removed 21% of the
 
04:39:05.070 --> 04:39:05.080 align:start position:0%
voter roles quarter of a million voters
 
04:39:06.750 --> 04:39:06.760 align:start position:0%
and if I know that the voter roles from
 
04:39:09.510 --> 04:39:09.520 align:start position:0%
2020 were unduly inflated and were
 
04:39:11.390 --> 04:39:11.400 align:start position:0%
inadequately maintained during that
 
04:39:15.070 --> 04:39:15.080 align:start position:0%
10-year interval between 2011 and 2021
 
04:39:18.070 --> 04:39:18.080 align:start position:0%
and if I know that a 4-year voter
 
04:39:20.551 --> 04:39:20.561 align:start position:0%
verification interval would prompt a
 
04:39:22.670 --> 04:39:22.680 align:start position:0%
more diligent and adequate maintenance
 
04:39:25.269 --> 04:39:25.279 align:start position:0%
of the checklist and if I know that the
 
04:39:28.510 --> 04:39:28.520 align:start position:0%
proposed look back period would capture
 
04:39:31.949 --> 04:39:31.959 align:start position:0%
the largest number of active voters by
 
04:39:33.470 --> 04:39:33.480 align:start position:0%

honorable
 
04:50:45.948 --> 04:50:45.958 align:start position:0%
Representatives this bill does two major
 
04:50:48.670 --> 04:50:48.680 align:start position:0%
things it A establishes A system that
 
04:50:51.230 --> 04:50:51.240 align:start position:0%
would allow any person to challenge
 
04:50:53.990 --> 04:50:54.000 align:start position:0%
another voter and thus disenfranchise
 
04:50:57.750 --> 04:50:57.760 align:start position:0%
them and B eradicates not just the ID
 
04:51:00.350 --> 04:51:00.360 align:start position:0%
and domicile affidavits but all
 
04:51:02.190 --> 04:51:02.200 align:start position:0%
affidavits associated with
 
04:51:04.830 --> 04:51:04.840 align:start position:0%
voting this would create a new voter
 
04:51:07.070 --> 04:51:07.080 align:start position:0%
challenge system that would allow anyone
 
04:51:09.190 --> 04:51:09.200 align:start position:0%
to challenge voters and provides the
 
04:51:11.708 --> 04:51:11.718 align:start position:0%
moderator with the sole discretion to
 
04:51:13.990 --> 04:51:14.000 align:start position:0%
prevent somebody from voting the
 
04:51:17.230 --> 04:51:17.240 align:start position:0%
challenge process allows anyone with a
 
04:51:19.310 --> 04:51:19.320 align:start position:0%
hypothetical grievance to stop a fellow
 
04:51:22.430 --> 04:51:22.440 align:start position:0%
voter from casting a ballot there is no
 
04:51:23.990 --> 04:51:24.000 align:start position:0%
meaningful due
 
04:51:27.310 --> 04:51:27.320 align:start position:0%
process uh for the potential voters
 
04:51:29.708 --> 04:51:29.718 align:start position:0%
whose most important right is being
 
04:51:32.910 --> 04:51:32.920 align:start position:0%
taken away while a challenged voter has
 
04:51:35.430 --> 04:51:35.440 align:start position:0%
the right to dispute the challenge at
 
04:51:38.868 --> 04:51:38.878 align:start position:0%
one of 11 New Hampshire Superior Courts
 
04:51:41.708 --> 04:51:41.718 align:start position:0%
it would be highly unlike
 
04:51:44.150 --> 04:51:44.160 align:start position:0%
if a voter is able to exercise that
 
04:51:48.590 --> 04:51:48.600 align:start position:0%
right because for example if challenged
 
04:51:51.910 --> 04:51:51.920 align:start position:0%
uh an individual who lives in Pittsburgh
 
04:51:54.150 --> 04:51:54.160 align:start position:0%
would have to travel an hour to The
 
04:51:54.160 --> 04:51:55.670 align:start position:0%
would have to travel an hour to The
Cordon

04:51:55.670 --> 04:51:55.680 align:start position:0%
Cordon
 
04:51:58.868 --> 04:51:58.878 align:start position:0%
Lancaster if an individual showed up to
 
04:52:01.548 --> 04:52:01.558 align:start position:0%
vote after at 5:00 P p.m. or after it's
 
04:52:03.430 --> 04:52:03.440 align:start position:0%
basically not worth it it is
 
04:52:06.030 --> 04:52:06.040 align:start position:0%
unreasonable to require challenge voters
 
04:52:08.270 --> 04:52:08.280 align:start position:0%
to go through all of this just to prove
 
04:52:09.510 --> 04:52:09.520 align:start position:0%
their own
 
04:52:09.520 --> 04:52:11.150 align:start position:0%
their own
eligibility

04:52:11.150 --> 04:52:11.160 align:start position:0%
eligibility
 
04:52:13.390 --> 04:52:13.400 align:start position:0%
ironically the challenge system relies
 
04:52:14.310 --> 04:52:14.320 align:start position:0%
on an
 
04:52:16.670 --> 04:52:16.680 align:start position:0%
affidavit uh on on the Affidavit of the
 
04:52:19.190 --> 04:52:19.200 align:start position:0%
Challenger it would it requires the
 
04:52:21.190 --> 04:52:21.200 align:start position:0%
Challenger to sign an affidavit to
 
04:52:23.670 --> 04:52:23.680 align:start position:0%
prevent another person from voting but
 
04:52:25.270 --> 04:52:25.280 align:start position:0%
the potential voter is not allowed to
 
04:52:28.750 --> 04:52:28.760 align:start position:0%
sign an affidavit to refute the
 
04:52:30.948 --> 04:52:30.958 align:start position:0%
Challenger someone could just walk into
 
04:52:33.868 --> 04:52:33.878 align:start position:0%
a polling location sign a few papers and
 
04:52:36.750 --> 04:52:36.760 align:start position:0%
take away your right to vote not making
 
04:52:39.190 --> 04:52:39.200 align:start position:0%
it more difficult to register and
 
04:52:41.030 --> 04:52:41.040 align:start position:0%
depriving someone
 
04:52:42.990 --> 04:52:43.000 align:start position:0%
uh of the right to vote based on
 
04:52:45.948 --> 04:52:45.958 align:start position:0%
allegations not backed by evidence is
 
04:52:48.990 --> 04:52:49.000 align:start position:0%
not the New Hampshire way secondly the
 
04:52:51.150 --> 04:52:51.160 align:start position:0%
eradication of all affidavits will
 
04:52:52.948 --> 04:52:52.958 align:start position:0%
disenfranchise many New Hampshire
 
04:52:56.270 --> 04:52:56.280 align:start position:0%
citizens Republicans Democrats and
 
04:52:58.910 --> 04:52:58.920 align:start position:0%
independents currently when registering
 
04:53:01.590 --> 04:53:01.600 align:start position:0%
to vote voters are asked to provide
 
04:53:05.390 --> 04:53:05.400 align:start position:0%
proof of identity age domicile and
 
04:53:07.788 --> 04:53:07.798 align:start position:0%
citizenship if they are registering and
 
04:53:10.910 --> 04:53:10.920 align:start position:0%
lack documentation for any of those they
 
04:53:13.390 --> 04:53:13.400 align:start position:0%
are able to sign an affidavit then
 
04:53:17.030 --> 04:53:17.040 align:start position:0%
register and cast a ballot when voters
 
04:53:19.230 --> 04:53:19.240 align:start position:0%
are signing a voting affidavit they
 
04:53:22.830 --> 04:53:22.840 align:start position:0%
swear under the oath to its veracity if
 
04:53:26.910 --> 04:53:26.920 align:start position:0%
false they face a fine of up to $5,000
 
04:53:29.430 --> 04:53:29.440 align:start position:0%
in a year in
 
04:53:32.510 --> 04:53:32.520 align:start position:0%
jail the documents required by this
 
04:53:35.830 --> 04:53:35.840 align:start position:0%

04:53:49.548 --> 04:53:49.558 align:start position:0%
take weeks to obtain and can be
 
04:53:51.230 --> 04:53:51.240 align:start position:0%
difficult for many people who are unsure
 
04:53:53.990 --> 04:53:54.000 align:start position:0%
about the state that they were born in
 
04:53:56.150 --> 04:53:56.160 align:start position:0%
while naturalization papers can cost
 
04:53:59.788 --> 04:53:59.798 align:start position:0%
well over $500 and take months to obtain
 
04:54:02.190 --> 04:54:02.200 align:start position:0%
college students houseless people
 
04:54:05.310 --> 04:54:05.320 align:start position:0%
seniors new Americans and Military
 
04:54:09.150 --> 04:54:09.160 align:start position:0%
members uh will be adversely affected by
 
04:54:12.590 --> 04:54:12.600 align:start position:0%
this bill if passed this would violate
 
04:54:14.990 --> 04:54:15.000 align:start position:0%
the federal requirement for provisional
 
04:54:17.548 --> 04:54:17.558 align:start position:0%
voting that was introduced in section
 
04:54:20.910 --> 04:54:20.920 align:start position:0%
302 of the help America vote act by
 
04:54:23.708 --> 04:54:23.718 align:start position:0%
failing to fulfill the required
 
04:54:23.718 --> 04:54:25.070 align:start position:0%
failing to fulfill the required
provisional

04:54:25.070 --> 04:54:25.080 align:start position:0%
provisional
 
04:54:27.750 --> 04:54:27.760 align:start position:0%
options finally this bill is
 
04:54:30.030 --> 04:54:30.040 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional in similar to
 
04:54:32.230 --> 04:54:32.240 align:start position:0%
legislation uh from Kansas that was
 
04:54:34.110 --> 04:54:34.120 align:start position:0%
struck down in the 10th Circuit Court of
 
04:54:37.070 --> 04:54:37.080 align:start position:0%
Appeals in 2020 New Hampshire has
 
04:54:39.150 --> 04:54:39.160 align:start position:0%
already gone through an expensive
 
04:54:41.350 --> 04:54:41.360 align:start position:0%
lawsuit uh when it comes to voting
 
04:54:44.150 --> 04:54:44.160 align:start position:0%
rights and this would immediately cost
 
04:54:46.948 --> 04:54:46.958 align:start position:0%
taxpayers uh and your constituents a
 
04:54:49.110 --> 04:54:49.120 align:start position:0%
bill that would rival the taxpayer what
 
04:54:52.110 --> 04:54:52.120 align:start position:0%
the taxpayers paid for s sp3 or nearly
 
04:54:55.190 --> 04:54:55.200 align:start position:0%
$4 million in legal fees the governor
 
04:54:57.310 --> 04:54:57.320 align:start position:0%
and Secretary of State have both
 
04:54:59.830 --> 04:54:59.840 align:start position:0%
reassured us that our elections are free
 
04:55:02.070 --> 04:55:02.080 align:start position:0%
and fair with no signs of widespread
 
04:55:02.080 --> 04:55:04.190 align:start position:0%

04:55:04.190 --> 04:55:04.200 align:start position:0%
voter
 
04:55:07.150 --> 04:55:07.160 align:start position:0%
fraud and the Attorney General closed 18
 
04:55:10.430 --> 04:55:10.440 align:start position:0%
investigations after the 2020 election
 
04:55:13.190 --> 04:55:13.200 align:start position:0%
uh with the result of no criminal or
 
04:55:15.990 --> 04:55:16.000 align:start position:0%
civil proceedings instances of voter
 
04:55:18.590 --> 04:55:18.600 align:start position:0%
fraud in New Hampshire are negligible
 
04:55:21.990 --> 04:55:22.000 align:start position:0%
and a UNH survey showed that 92% of New
 
04:55:24.430 --> 04:55:24.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire voters have confidence in the
 
04:55:27.350 --> 04:55:27.360 align:start position:0%
outcome of the 2022 election yet this
 
04:55:29.628 --> 04:55:29.638 align:start position:0%
bill upends our same day
 
04:55:32.310 --> 04:55:32.320 align:start position:0%
registration system uh by eliminating
 
04:55:34.670 --> 04:55:34.680 align:start position:0%
the affidavit system that has worked
 
04:55:37.390 --> 04:55:37.400 align:start position:0%
well for decades if you believe this
 
04:55:39.670 --> 04:55:39.680 align:start position:0%
bill would disenfranchise voters
 
04:55:41.990 --> 04:55:42.000 align:start position:0%
threatened take uh their right to vote
 
04:55:45.030 --> 04:55:45.040 align:start position:0%
away leave taxpayers with a hefty bill
 
04:55:48.070 --> 04:55:48.080 align:start position:0%
and if passed in uh into law before
 
04:55:50.470 --> 04:55:50.480 align:start position:0%
would be enacted before the 2024
 
04:55:53.030 --> 04:55:53.040 align:start position:0%
election then I would vote no on the
 
04:55:55.310 --> 04:55:55.320 align:start position:0%
motion of ought to pass so a more
 
04:55:57.270 --> 04:55:57.280 align:start position:0%
appropriate one could be made and Mr
 
04:56:01.670 --> 04:56:01.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:04.070 --> 04:56:04.080 align:start position:0%

attention I will be brief Less Than 3
 
04:56:16.230 --> 04:56:16.240 align:start position:0%
minutes over two decades ago in the fall
 
04:56:20.110 --> 04:56:20.120 align:start position:0%
of 2000 the forensics crime drama CSI
 
04:56:22.390 --> 04:56:22.400 align:start position:0%
crime Scene Investigation premiered it
 
04:56:24.868 --> 04:56:24.878 align:start position:0%
was a captivating series and the opening
 
04:56:27.510 --> 04:56:27.520 align:start position:0%
theme of that great TV show asked an
 
04:56:32.190 --> 04:56:32.200 align:start position:0%
important question who are you do do do
 
04:56:35.150 --> 04:56:35.160 align:start position:0%
do and just a few days ago in many towns
 
04:56:37.150 --> 04:56:37.160 align:start position:0%
throughout New Hampshire in the context
 
04:56:39.350 --> 04:56:39.360 align:start position:0%
of voting that same question was
 
04:56:41.070 --> 04:56:41.080 align:start position:0%
repeatedly asked throughout the granite
 
04:56:44.788 --> 04:56:44.798 align:start position:0%
state who are you our bill for
 
04:56:46.948 --> 04:56:46.958 align:start position:0%
consideration clarifies those four
 
04:56:49.948 --> 04:56:49.958 align:start position:0%
qualifications for voting citizenship
 
04:56:52.750 --> 04:56:52.760 align:start position:0%
age domicile and identity and once a
 
04:56:54.390 --> 04:56:54.400 align:start position:0%
person is registered to vote in the
 
04:56:56.430 --> 04:56:56.440 align:start position:0%
great state of New Hampshire they need
 
04:56:59.708 --> 04:56:59.718 align:start position:0%
only answer that one question who are
 
04:57:02.310 --> 04:57:02.320 align:start position:0%
you the bill also makes provision for
 
04:57:04.670 --> 04:57:04.680 align:start position:0%
General voter registration registering
 
04:57:06.948 --> 04:57:06.958 align:start position:0%
at the polling place and election day
 
04:57:10.510 --> 04:57:10.520 align:start position:0%
registration as well now you may ask
 
04:57:12.310 --> 04:57:12.320 align:start position:0%
what would a potential voter do if they
 
04:57:14.708 --> 04:57:14.718 align:start position:0%
were lacking a valid photo
 
04:57:17.310 --> 04:57:17.320 align:start position:0%
identification this bill addresses that
 
04:57:19.270 --> 04:57:19.280 align:start position:0%
situation the supervisor of the
 
04:57:21.430 --> 04:57:21.440 align:start position:0%
checklist can attempt to establish that
 
04:57:23.510 --> 04:57:23.520 align:start position:0%
that voter meets the New Hampshire's
 
04:57:23.520 --> 04:57:25.270 align:start position:0%

voting
 
04:57:27.750 --> 04:57:27.760 align:start position:0%
criteria and if that is problematic the
 
04:57:30.110 --> 04:57:30.120 align:start position:0%
bill provides for an immediate remedy
 
04:57:32.868 --> 04:57:32.878 align:start position:0%
through the superior court but let's
 
04:57:35.230 --> 04:57:35.240 align:start position:0%
return to the question of the moment may
 
04:57:37.708 --> 04:57:37.718 align:start position:0%

very very well so if I know that passing
 
05:01:17.590 --> 05:01:17.600 align:start position:0%
this bill will re will create upheaval
 
05:01:20.548 --> 05:01:20.558 align:start position:0%
in our fall elections because it will go
 
05:01:23.830 --> 05:01:23.840 align:start position:0%
into effect immediately before our
 
05:01:26.390 --> 05:01:26.400 align:start position:0%
primaries and it is overturning our
 
05:01:29.670 --> 05:01:29.680 align:start position:0%
entire way that we hold elections and if
 
05:01:31.868 --> 05:01:31.878 align:start position:0%
I know that this bill is
 
05:01:34.270 --> 05:01:34.280 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional and will spawn
 
05:01:34.280 --> 05:01:35.990 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional and will spawn
expensive

05:01:35.990 --> 05:01:36.000 align:start position:0%
expensive
 
05:01:39.910 --> 05:01:39.920 align:start position:0%
litigation and if I know that this bill
 
05:01:43.868 --> 05:01:43.878 align:start position:0%
will take away our most important right
 
05:01:47.150 --> 05:01:47.160 align:start position:0%
the right to vote from thousands of New
 
05:01:50.310 --> 05:01:50.320 align:start position:0%

05:01:55.548 --> 05:01:55.558 align:start position:0%

05:02:01.868 --> 05:02:01.878 align:start position:0%
widespread fraud under our current

05:11:06.628 --> 05:11:06.638 align:start position:0%
the question is whether to reconsider
 
05:11:09.430 --> 05:11:09.440 align:start position:0%
House Bill 1029 representative spel is
 
05:11:17.030 --> 05:11:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:19.990 --> 05:11:20.000 align:start position:0%
inquiry thank you Mr Speaker if I know
 
05:11:21.910 --> 05:11:21.920 align:start position:0%
that some people were unaware of the
 
05:11:26.430 --> 05:11:26.440 align:start position:0%
fact that uh the the Atlantic commission
 
05:11:28.788 --> 05:11:28.798 align:start position:0%
actually does not mandate the reporting
 
05:11:30.670 --> 05:11:30.680 align:start position:0%
of data but it's just a suggestion and
 
05:11:32.590 --> 05:11:32.600 align:start position:0%
that the landing license actually has no
 
05:11:34.510 --> 05:11:34.520 align:start position:0%
tie into the way that that data is
 
05:11:37.070 --> 05:11:37.080 align:start position:0%
collected by fishing game that the data
 
05:11:39.750 --> 05:11:39.760 align:start position:0%
is actually voluntarily submitted and
 
05:11:41.470 --> 05:11:41.480 align:start position:0%
can still be voluntarily submitted if we
 
05:11:45.190 --> 05:11:45.200 align:start position:0%
don't charge people $50 for bringing the
 
05:11:48.110 --> 05:11:48.120 align:start position:0%
lobsters or crabs to shore on a boat and
 
05:11:50.030 --> 05:11:50.040 align:start position:0%
if I further know that if somebody walks
 
05:11:52.030 --> 05:11:52.040 align:start position:0%
out from Shore to get crab and then
 
05:11:53.470 --> 05:11:53.480 align:start position:0%
walks back they don't have to pay the
 
05:11:56.470 --> 05:11:56.480 align:start position:0%
$50 but if they do so from a boat they
 
05:11:59.190 --> 05:11:59.200 align:start position:0%
do have to pay $50 and if I further know
 
05:12:01.670 --> 05:12:01.680 align:start position:0%
that if somebody does it on Route 93 and
 
05:12:03.470 --> 05:12:03.480 align:start position:0%
comes up they don't have to pay the $50
 
05:12:04.990 --> 05:12:05.000 align:start position:0%
but if they come in on a boat they have
 
05:12:05.788 --> 05:12:05.798 align:start position:0%
to do
 
05:12:09.830 --> 05:12:09.840 align:start position:0%
$50 would I now press green to allow
 
05:12:11.948 --> 05:12:11.958 align:start position:0%
reconsideration so that several members
 
05:12:14.030 --> 05:12:14.040 align:start position:0%
who did not know this information could
 
05:12:16.990 --> 05:12:17.000 align:start position:0%
now make the correct choice and try to
 
05:12:18.470 --> 05:12:18.480 align:start position:0%
send this bill over to the other body
 
05:12:20.548 --> 05:12:20.558 align:start position:0%
where another public hearing could flesh
 
05:12:22.670 --> 05:12:22.680 align:start position:0%
out all of the
 
05:12:24.670 --> 05:12:24.680 align:start position:0%
complications representative Darby's
 
05:12:29.670 --> 05:12:29.680 align:start position:0%

05:12:42.230 --> 05:12:42.240 align:start position:0%
extensively debated this last week and
 
05:12:44.708 --> 05:12:44.718 align:start position:0%

presented not questioned um and not
 
05:12:54.868 --> 05:12:54.878 align:start position:0%
raised during public hearings and that
 
05:12:57.830 --> 05:12:57.840 align:start position:0%
if it were to be presented it if new

information were to come forward it
 
05:13:01.310 --> 05:13:01.320 align:start position:0%
should come through a public hearing

where this body can discuss it and if I
 
05:13:05.708 --> 05:13:05.718 align:start position:0%

thank you honorable members I rise today
 
05:16:17.948 --> 05:16:17.958 align:start position:0%
to speak against the a to pass for SP
 
05:16:20.990 --> 05:16:21.000 align:start position:0%
395 for several reasons all of New
 
05:16:22.830 --> 05:16:22.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire citizens have been having to
 
05:16:26.350 --> 05:16:26.360 align:start position:0%
work extra hard in these difficult times
 
05:16:28.830 --> 05:16:28.840 align:start position:0%
when everything costs more I am sure
 
05:16:31.868 --> 05:16:31.878 align:start position:0%
many of us in here and our constituents
 
05:16:33.868 --> 05:16:33.878 align:start position:0%
would like to have an assistant to help
 
05:16:36.628 --> 05:16:36.638 align:start position:0%
them in their daily work unfortunately
 
05:16:40.150 --> 05:16:40.160 align:start position:0%
that is not possible or practical
 
05:16:42.030 --> 05:16:42.040 align:start position:0%
as you may or may not know the
 
05:16:44.390 --> 05:16:44.400 align:start position:0%
Department of Agriculture is ending the
 
05:16:47.150 --> 05:16:47.160 align:start position:0%
organic program in April due to staffing
 
05:16:49.750 --> 05:16:49.760 align:start position:0%
issues and the high cost to run the
 
05:16:52.030 --> 05:16:52.040 align:start position:0%
program that should free up some of the
 
05:16:55.190 --> 05:16:55.200 align:start position:0%
burden the agency had with a couple of
 
05:16:57.190 --> 05:16:57.200 align:start position:0%
their staff that were handling the
 
05:17:00.868 --> 05:17:00.878 align:start position:0%
program I strongly believe the agency
 
05:17:03.350 --> 05:17:03.360 align:start position:0%
Actually All State agencies should be
 
05:17:06.190 --> 05:17:06.200 align:start position:0%
working feverishly to tighten up their
 
05:17:09.390 --> 05:17:09.400 align:start position:0%
operations especially to eliminate waste
 
05:17:12.430 --> 05:17:12.440 align:start position:0%
redundancy and fine cost savings but
 
05:17:15.230 --> 05:17:15.240 align:start position:0%
moreover to work more efficiently our
 
05:17:17.150 --> 05:17:17.160 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire families are doing this
 
05:17:19.990 --> 05:17:20.000 align:start position:0%
every day and we need to demand the same
 
05:17:22.350 --> 05:17:22.360 align:start position:0%
from our government we all know how
 
05:17:25.110 --> 05:17:25.120 align:start position:0%
bloated government agencies have become
 
05:17:27.910 --> 05:17:27.920 align:start position:0%
let's support working smarter not harder
 
05:17:29.788 --> 05:17:29.798 align:start position:0%
and not further burdening the New
 
05:17:32.230 --> 05:17:32.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire taxpayer please vote red on
 
05:17:34.430 --> 05:17:34.440 align:start position:0%
the ought to pass so another motion can
 
05:17:36.910 --> 05:17:36.920 align:start position:0%
be made and Mr Speaker I ask for a
 
05:17:40.270 --> 05:17:40.280 align:start position:0%

05:18:52.830 --> 05:18:52.840 align:start position:0%

inquiry thank you Mr
 
05:19:06.708 --> 05:19:06.718 align:start position:0%
Speaker I know that this is a Senate
 
05:19:08.948 --> 05:19:08.958 align:start position:0%
bill that's being pushed through through
 
05:19:08.958 --> 05:19:09.708 align:start position:0%
bill that's being pushed through through
pretty

05:19:09.708 --> 05:19:09.718 align:start position:0%
pretty
 
05:19:11.750 --> 05:19:11.760 align:start position:0%
quickly while we're busy dealing with
 
05:19:14.230 --> 05:19:14.240 align:start position:0%
house bills if I know that this is on a
 
05:19:16.750 --> 05:19:16.760 align:start position:0%
rocket docket of some type because the
 
05:19:19.470 --> 05:19:19.480 align:start position:0%
position was accounted for in hb2 LA or
 
05:19:23.670 --> 05:19:23.680 align:start position:0%
hb1 last year financially but not in
 
05:19:26.670 --> 05:19:26.680 align:start position:0%
hb2 but if I know the position creates a
 
05:19:29.350 --> 05:19:29.360 align:start position:0%
third senior management position in the
 
05:19:32.788 --> 05:19:32.798 align:start position:0%
department of a with a minimum salary of
 
05:19:36.990 --> 05:19:37.000 align:start position:0%
$887,000 and a potential salary of
 
05:19:40.030 --> 05:19:40.040 align:start position:0%
$121,000 resulting in a half a million
 
05:19:41.868 --> 05:19:41.878 align:start position:0%
dollar cost potentially including
 
05:19:45.110 --> 05:19:45.120 align:start position:0%
benefits over the next three years for
 
05:19:47.590 --> 05:19:47.600 align:start position:0%
this department if I know that the
 
05:19:49.510 --> 05:19:49.520 align:start position:0%
current budget for this department is
 
05:19:53.990 --> 05:19:54.000 align:start position:0%
just over $2.8 million and has 51
 
05:19:56.830 --> 05:19:56.840 align:start position:0%
positions and that we don't need yet one
 
05:19:59.350 --> 05:19:59.360 align:start position:0%
more Senior Management person would I
 
05:20:01.510 --> 05:20:01.520 align:start position:0%

of sovereignty is a natural
 
05:32:41.430 --> 05:32:41.440 align:start position:0%
concern we do things well here in the

states have in accordance with the

charter of the United Nations and the
 
05:33:11.590 --> 05:33:11.600 align:start position:0%
general principles of international law
 
05:33:14.510 --> 05:33:14.520 align:start position:0%
The Sovereign right to legislate and

Implement legislation in pursuance of
 
05:33:18.190 --> 05:33:18.200 align:start position:0%
their health
 
05:33:20.868 --> 05:33:20.878 align:start position:0%
policies that level of production might
 
05:33:23.948 --> 05:33:23.958 align:start position:0%
be unconvincing and if so recall that
 
05:33:26.910 --> 05:33:26.920 align:start position:0%
2third of the federal Senate must give
 
05:33:29.350 --> 05:33:29.360 align:start position:0%
advice and consent before a treaty's
 
05:33:33.230 --> 05:33:33.240 align:start position:0%
ratification and let's be real 2/3 of
 
05:33:35.030 --> 05:33:35.040 align:start position:0%
the federal Senate is unlikely to agree
 
05:33:36.830 --> 05:33:36.840 align:start position:0%
to their coffee order before they're
 
05:33:38.510 --> 05:33:38.520 align:start position:0%
likely to agree to International
 
05:33:41.990 --> 05:33:42.000 align:start position:0%
pandemic response treaty and finally
 
05:33:44.390 --> 05:33:44.400 align:start position:0%
even if the implausible happens and the
 
05:33:46.590 --> 05:33:46.600 align:start position:0%
federal Senate does give advice and
 
05:33:49.788 --> 05:33:49.798 align:start position:0%
consent to something treaties are rarely
 
05:33:52.990 --> 05:33:53.000 align:start position:0%
self- enforcing that is they require
 
05:33:55.430 --> 05:33:55.440 align:start position:0%
further enacting legislation to put them
 
05:33:58.548 --> 05:33:58.558 align:start position:0%
into practice that would require further
 
05:34:01.070 --> 05:34:01.080 align:start position:0%
congressional action from a body that
 
05:34:03.470 --> 05:34:03.480 align:start position:0%
often moves at glacial
 
05:34:07.190 --> 05:34:07.200 align:start position:0%
Pace finally our state constitution at
 
05:34:08.310 --> 05:34:08.320 align:start position:0%
article 7
 
05:34:10.990 --> 05:34:11.000 align:start position:0%
protects our state sovereignty in all
 
05:34:14.150 --> 05:34:14.160 align:start position:0%
areas not already explicitly delegated
 
05:34:14.160 --> 05:34:14.910 align:start position:0%
areas not already explicitly delegated
to

05:34:14.910 --> 05:34:14.920 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:34:17.110 --> 05:34:17.120 align:start position:0%
Congress and while there's complex
 
05:34:19.628 --> 05:34:19.638 align:start position:0%
constitutional arguments to be had here
 
05:34:21.670 --> 05:34:21.680 align:start position:0%
were Congress to enact legislation
 
05:34:24.788 --> 05:34:24.798 align:start position:0%
abrogating individual State sovereignty
 
05:34:26.910 --> 05:34:26.920 align:start position:0%
it's hard to see that surviving any type
 
05:34:28.070 --> 05:34:28.080 align:start position:0%
of judicial
 
05:34:31.270 --> 05:34:31.280 align:start position:0%

05:34:40.750 --> 05:34:40.760 align:start position:0%
happening state in US law doesn't
 
05:34:44.868 --> 05:34:44.878 align:start position:0%
provide a means for it thus this bill
 
05:34:47.510 --> 05:34:47.520 align:start position:0%
while while intention May Chase
 
05:34:49.750 --> 05:34:49.760 align:start position:0%
windmills my second point of opposition
 
05:34:51.590 --> 05:34:51.600 align:start position:0%
is that the bill goes too far in
 
05:34:54.510 --> 05:34:54.520 align:start position:0%
addressing a narrow grievance the bill
 
05:34:56.708 --> 05:34:56.718 align:start position:0%
focuses on the World Health Organization
 
05:34:58.948 --> 05:34:58.958 align:start position:0%
or alternatively the Centers for Disease
 
05:35:02.270 --> 05:35:02.280 align:start position:0%
Control and perhaps that's natural given
 
05:35:03.990 --> 05:35:04.000 align:start position:0%
our recent shared experience in the
 
05:35:06.750 --> 05:35:06.760 align:start position:0%
World Health Organization in CDC being
 
05:35:09.708 --> 05:35:09.718 align:start position:0%
in headlines of we all grappled with an
 
05:35:11.670 --> 05:35:11.680 align:start position:0%
unprecedented Global
 
05:35:13.830 --> 05:35:13.840 align:start position:0%

05:35:16.590 --> 05:35:16.600 align:start position:0%
and CDC recommendations about Co
 
05:35:19.830 --> 05:35:19.840 align:start position:0%
undoubtedly struck some as unnecessary
 
05:35:19.840 --> 05:35:20.670 align:start position:0%
undoubtedly struck some as unnecessary
and

05:35:20.670 --> 05:35:20.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:35:22.628 --> 05:35:22.638 align:start position:0%
excessive others may have found them as
 
05:35:25.230 --> 05:35:25.240 align:start position:0%
coming up short but what's important is
 
05:35:27.470 --> 05:35:27.480 align:start position:0%
the World Health Organization and cdc's
 
05:35:31.510 --> 05:35:31.520 align:start position:0%
work extends well beyond pandemic
 
05:35:33.230 --> 05:35:33.240 align:start position:0%
preparedness the World Health
 
05:35:35.230 --> 05:35:35.240 align:start position:0%
Organization recommends that all those
 
05:35:38.150 --> 05:35:38.160 align:start position:0%
at high risk for HIV consider regular
 
05:35:41.190 --> 05:35:41.200 align:start position:0%
testing and consider pre-exposure
 
05:35:42.830 --> 05:35:42.840 align:start position:0%
prophylaxis the World Health
 
05:35:44.750 --> 05:35:44.760 align:start position:0%
Organization recommends early initiation
 
05:35:46.628 --> 05:35:46.638 align:start position:0%
of breastfeeding and says breastfeeding
 
05:35:49.990 --> 05:35:50.000 align:start position:0%
is a vital part of infant nutrition and
 
05:35:51.670 --> 05:35:51.680 align:start position:0%
the World Health Organization recommends
 
05:35:53.628 --> 05:35:53.638 align:start position:0%
raw Mercury be limited to less than one
 
05:35:56.670 --> 05:35:56.680 align:start position:0%
microgram per liter of fresh water of
 
05:35:59.948 --> 05:35:59.958 align:start position:0%
course this list could go on and on as
 
05:36:01.590 --> 05:36:01.600 align:start position:0%
World Health Organization and CDC
 
05:36:04.510 --> 05:36:04.520 align:start position:0%
recommendations touch upon every area of
 
05:36:08.910 --> 05:36:08.920 align:start position:0%
our health but suffice it to say that
 
05:36:14.070 --> 05:36:14.080 align:start position:0%
while the who may eror it also does good
 
05:36:16.310 --> 05:36:16.320 align:start position:0%
its recommendations ought be evaluated
 
05:36:19.470 --> 05:36:19.480 align:start position:0%
on their individual merits and analyzed
 
05:36:22.590 --> 05:36:22.600 align:start position:0%
according to good reason that may
 
05:36:25.470 --> 05:36:25.480 align:start position:0%
sometimes lead to different conclusions
 
05:36:27.750 --> 05:36:27.760 align:start position:0%
among reasonable and well-intentioned
 
05:36:29.990 --> 05:36:30.000 align:start position:0%
people and that's
 
05:36:32.390 --> 05:36:32.400 align:start position:0%
okay and that recognition of difference
 
05:36:35.150 --> 05:36:35.160 align:start position:0%
of opinion leads to my final point in
 
05:36:38.750 --> 05:36:38.760 align:start position:0%
opposition the bill of friends Free
 
05:36:42.030 --> 05:36:42.040 align:start position:0%
Speech the Bill's terms State any
 
05:36:43.990 --> 05:36:44.000 align:start position:0%
requirements mandates or instructions
 
05:36:45.708 --> 05:36:45.718 align:start position:0%
from the World Health Organization shall
 
05:36:47.670 --> 05:36:47.680 align:start position:0%
not be used in the state to justify any
 
05:36:50.548 --> 05:36:50.558 align:start position:0%
mask vaccine or medical testing
 
05:36:54.070 --> 05:36:54.080 align:start position:0%
requirements thus the bill seeks to
 
05:36:56.910 --> 05:36:56.920 align:start position:0%
eliminate from public debate and
 
05:37:01.030 --> 05:37:01.040 align:start position:0%
consideration a Viewpoint and ideas
 
05:37:03.270 --> 05:37:03.280 align:start position:0%
which some may find to be offensive or
 
05:37:06.230 --> 05:37:06.240 align:start position:0%
wrong as the bill forbids World Health
 
05:37:08.190 --> 05:37:08.200 align:start position:0%
Organization recommendations
 
05:37:10.190 --> 05:37:10.200 align:start position:0%
from being used to justify Health
 
05:37:13.230 --> 05:37:13.240 align:start position:0%
requirements now imagine the situation
 
05:37:15.910 --> 05:37:15.920 align:start position:0%
this creates if a local school board
 
05:37:17.830 --> 05:37:17.840 align:start position:0%
member mentions the World Health
 
05:37:20.910 --> 05:37:20.920 align:start position:0%
Organization when debating a proposal
 
05:37:22.830 --> 05:37:22.840 align:start position:0%
that board member has probably done
 
05:37:25.190 --> 05:37:25.200 align:start position:0%
something wrong they've likely put the
 
05:37:27.948 --> 05:37:27.958 align:start position:0%
proposal in the crosshairs of litigation
 
05:37:32.070 --> 05:37:32.080 align:start position:0%
merely because a Viewpoint was expressed
 
05:37:34.708 --> 05:37:34.718 align:start position:0%
or if a city council passes a measure
 
05:37:36.150 --> 05:37:36.160 align:start position:0%
and the minutes reflect a counselor
 
05:37:38.390 --> 05:37:38.400 align:start position:0%
opined on World Health organiz ation
 
05:37:40.510 --> 05:37:40.520 align:start position:0%
recommendations that council's ordinance
 
05:37:42.990 --> 05:37:43.000 align:start position:0%
is in Peril because a counselor
 
05:37:46.708 --> 05:37:46.718 align:start position:0%
expressed an opinion based on available
 
05:37:50.030 --> 05:37:50.040 align:start position:0%
data recall that article 222 of our
 
05:37:53.190 --> 05:37:53.200 align:start position:0%
state constitution says that free speech
 
05:37:56.270 --> 05:37:56.280 align:start position:0%
in Liberty of the press are essential to
 
05:37:59.670 --> 05:37:59.680 align:start position:0%
the security and freedom in a state they
 
05:38:04.310 --> 05:38:04.320 align:start position:0%
ought therefore to be inviolably
 
05:38:07.548 --> 05:38:07.558 align:start position:0%
preserved that's a huge undertaking and
 
05:38:09.868 --> 05:38:09.878 align:start position:0%
and often a difficult
 
05:38:12.430 --> 05:38:12.440 align:start position:0%
one indeed the late Supreme Court
 
05:38:15.310 --> 05:38:15.320 align:start position:0%
Justice Louis brandise a Titan of free
 
05:38:17.350 --> 05:38:17.360 align:start position:0%
speech Juris Prudence said the cure to
 
05:38:22.990 --> 05:38:23.000 align:start position:0%
speech is more speech not enforced
 
05:38:26.628 --> 05:38:26.638 align:start position:0%
silence as a state and as a nation we
 
05:38:31.670 --> 05:38:31.680 align:start position:0%
don't suppress ideas we don't like we
 
05:38:34.230 --> 05:38:34.240 align:start position:0%
don't remove them from public debate and
 
05:38:36.910 --> 05:38:36.920 align:start position:0%
consideration simply because we disagree
 
05:38:38.390 --> 05:38:38.400 align:start position:0%
or find them
 
05:38:43.110 --> 05:38:43.120 align:start position:0%
offensive we do it differently we speak
 
05:38:47.868 --> 05:38:47.878 align:start position:0%
up we out debate we plead persuade and
 
05:38:52.110 --> 05:38:52.120 align:start position:0%
protest and if we lose we might even try
 
05:38:55.190 --> 05:38:55.200 align:start position:0%
again but we don't
 
05:38:59.190 --> 05:38:59.200 align:start position:0%
silence so here rather than whole scale
 
05:39:01.350 --> 05:39:01.360 align:start position:0%
stopping the school board member or
 
05:39:03.030 --> 05:39:03.040 align:start position:0%
local councilmen from citing the World
 
05:39:05.590 --> 05:39:05.600 align:start position:0%
Health Organization the notion of free
 
05:39:08.230 --> 05:39:08.240 align:start position:0%
speech Demands a different outcome
 
05:39:10.750 --> 05:39:10.760 align:start position:0%
defeat those ideas at the
 
05:39:15.390 --> 05:39:15.400 align:start position:0%
lecturn convince others to your side and
 
05:39:17.390 --> 05:39:17.400 align:start position:0%
may the best ideas
 
05:39:21.468 --> 05:39:21.478 align:start position:0%
win and ultimately that's the hard
 
05:39:25.230 --> 05:39:25.240 align:start position:0%
painful work of free speech because it
 
05:39:27.310 --> 05:39:27.320 align:start position:0%
doesn't ask us to protect the ideas with
 
05:39:31.190 --> 05:39:31.200 align:start position:0%
which we agree that's the easy part
 
05:39:33.868 --> 05:39:33.878 align:start position:0%
rather Free Speech asks us to protect
 
05:39:37.350 --> 05:39:37.360 align:start position:0%
the ideas we loath those that rile us to
 
05:39:40.030 --> 05:39:40.040 align:start position:0%
to our core because
 
05:39:43.708 --> 05:39:43.718 align:start position:0%
ultimately those ideas have value too in
 
05:39:45.628 --> 05:39:45.638 align:start position:0%
a Marketplace of
 
05:39:49.390 --> 05:39:49.400 align:start position:0%
ideas voler once said as paraphrased by
 
05:39:51.868 --> 05:39:51.878 align:start position:0%
one of our esteemed colleagues earlier
 
05:39:55.990 --> 05:39:56.000 align:start position:0%
today I may not agree with what you say
 
05:39:57.548 --> 05:39:57.558 align:start position:0%
but I will defend to the death your
 
05:40:01.548 --> 05:40:01.558 align:start position:0%
right to say it it remains true now
 
05:40:04.070 --> 05:40:04.080 align:start position:0%
whether hundreds of minutes or hundreds
 
05:40:05.270 --> 05:40:05.280 align:start position:0%
of years
 
05:40:09.270 --> 05:40:09.280 align:start position:0%
later and thus Mr Mr Speaker I urge the
 
05:40:12.430 --> 05:40:12.440 align:start position:0%
body to press the red button on this OTP
 
05:40:15.270 --> 05:40:15.280 align:start position:0%
motion because the bill addresses an
 
05:40:15.280 --> 05:40:16.510 align:start position:0%
motion because the bill addresses an
improbable

05:40:16.510 --> 05:40:16.520 align:start position:0%
improbable
 
05:40:19.310 --> 05:40:19.320 align:start position:0%
problem the bill goes too far in
 
05:40:20.788 --> 05:40:20.798 align:start position:0%
addressing a narrow
 
05:40:23.310 --> 05:40:23.320 align:start position:0%
grievance and because the bill tramples
 
05:40:25.868 --> 05:40:25.878 align:start position:0%
on the essence of free speech the
 
05:40:29.270 --> 05:40:29.280 align:start position:0%
protection of the ideas we hate May the
 
05:40:32.430 --> 05:40:32.440 align:start position:0%
cacophony of debate live on and may we
 
05:40:36.230 --> 05:40:36.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:36.240 --> 05:40:41.830 align:start position:0%
 
speech

05:40:41.830 --> 05:40:41.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:46.468 --> 05:40:46.478 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:48.830 --> 05:40:48.840 align:start position:0%
beler thank you Mr
 
05:40:51.190 --> 05:40:51.200 align:start position:0%
Speaker this bill is an important one to
 
05:40:55.910 --> 05:40:55.920 align:start position:0%
me this bill foremost acts to nullify
 
05:40:57.350 --> 05:40:57.360 align:start position:0%
the authority of the World Health
 
05:40:59.830 --> 05:40:59.840 align:start position:0%
Organization within the borders of the
 
05:41:02.670 --> 05:41:02.680 align:start position:0%
state in early Co times is now known
 
05:41:04.590 --> 05:41:04.600 align:start position:0%
that extremely aggressive ventilator
 
05:41:06.830 --> 05:41:06.840 align:start position:0%
treatments for ill patients resulted in
 
05:41:09.270 --> 05:41:09.280 align:start position:0%
significant amounts of unnecessary
 
05:41:12.030 --> 05:41:12.040 align:start position:0%
morbidity immortality those guidelines
 
05:41:14.390 --> 05:41:14.400 align:start position:0%
killed Americans where did they come

healthc care professional though he has
 
05:41:33.750 --> 05:41:33.760 align:start position:0%
been credibly accused of covering up

dead in the streets lockdown procedures
 
05:42:29.230 --> 05:42:29.240 align:start position:0%
including the welding of apartment doors
 
05:42:32.708 --> 05:42:32.718 align:start position:0%
shut and other Draconian measures China
 
05:42:35.750 --> 05:42:35.760 align:start position:0%
developed the lockdown model and went to
 
05:42:38.030 --> 05:42:38.040 align:start position:0%
Great Lengths to scare the the world the
 
05:42:40.830 --> 05:42:40.840 align:start position:0%
Western world into adopting it to make
 
05:42:45.230 --> 05:42:45.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:48.948 --> 05:42:48.958 align:start position:0%
economies now we credibly Face a threat
 
05:42:51.750 --> 05:42:51.760 align:start position:0%
as an existing treaty is up for
 
05:42:55.310 --> 05:42:55.320 align:start position:0%
modification an existing treaty who here
 
05:42:58.910 --> 05:42:58.920 align:start position:0%
trusts that a treaty as modified will
 
05:43:02.230 --> 05:43:02.240 align:start position:0%
require the same full approval process
 
05:43:04.350 --> 05:43:04.360 align:start position:0%
by the House and Senate as a normal
 
05:43:06.030 --> 05:43:06.040 align:start position:0%
treaty and they will not attempt to
 
05:43:08.468 --> 05:43:08.478 align:start position:0%
enforce this on us without going through
 
05:43:12.150 --> 05:43:12.160 align:start position:0%
that process again this treaty would
 
05:43:15.150 --> 05:43:15.160 align:start position:0%
effectively put the who in charge
 
05:43:18.190 --> 05:43:18.200 align:start position:0%
directly of New Hampshire Health policy
 
05:43:20.590 --> 05:43:20.600 align:start position:0%
they could demand we lock down our
 
05:43:24.590 --> 05:43:24.600 align:start position:0%
economy again and guess why it's not
 
05:43:26.510 --> 05:43:26.520 align:start position:0%
just pandemics it's not just viruses
 
05:43:27.910 --> 05:43:27.920 align:start position:0%
here's a couple other things that the
 
05:43:30.070 --> 05:43:30.080 align:start position:0%
World Health Organization believes are
 
05:43:32.190 --> 05:43:32.200 align:start position:0%
threats that might require
 
05:43:36.390 --> 05:43:36.400 align:start position:0%
lockdown climate change and racism
 
05:43:37.788 --> 05:43:37.798 align:start position:0%
according to them those are public
 
05:43:39.788 --> 05:43:39.798 align:start position:0%
health threats that could qualify for
 
05:43:39.798 --> 05:43:41.510 align:start position:0%
health threats that could qualify for
economic

05:43:41.510 --> 05:43:41.520 align:start position:0%
economic
 
05:43:45.628 --> 05:43:45.638 align:start position:0%
lockdowns lastly if the who happens to
 
05:43:48.788 --> 05:43:48.798 align:start position:0%
get something right there's nothing that
 
05:43:50.868 --> 05:43:50.878 align:start position:0%
would prevent our health professionals
 
05:43:53.230 --> 05:43:53.240 align:start position:0%

directly who guidelines to justify our
 
05:44:03.548 --> 05:44:03.558 align:start position:0%
own actions we can still do it if it's
 
05:44:05.230 --> 05:44:05.240 align:start position:0%

know this bill is unnecessary because it
 
05:49:47.110 --> 05:49:47.120 align:start position:0%
is entirely a matter for a Sovereign

Speaker to be sure our American Health
 
05:54:59.150 --> 05:54:59.160 align:start position:0%
Care System needs improvements we spend
 
05:55:01.150 --> 05:55:01.160 align:start position:0%
far too much per capita than any other
 
05:55:02.948 --> 05:55:02.958 align:start position:0%
country and there's certainly policies
 
05:55:06.350 --> 05:55:06.360 align:start position:0%
and efficiencies that we need to look at
 
05:55:08.070 --> 05:55:08.080 align:start position:0%
there are certainly gaps in coverage we
 
05:55:10.430 --> 05:55:10.440 align:start position:0%
know that we can do better but is
 
05:55:12.350 --> 05:55:12.360 align:start position:0%
single-payer national health insurance
 
05:55:15.070 --> 05:55:15.080 align:start position:0%
the best way to go just look at the
 
05:55:17.948 --> 05:55:17.958 align:start position:0%
countries that have that that have gone
 
05:55:20.750 --> 05:55:20.760 align:start position:0%
there some have had experiences better
 
05:55:23.270 --> 05:55:23.280 align:start position:0%
than others but all too often they end
 
05:55:25.868 --> 05:55:25.878 align:start position:0%
up with lower Quality Health Care
 
05:55:27.590 --> 05:55:27.600 align:start position:0%
especially if Health Care Providers
 
05:55:30.110 --> 05:55:30.120 align:start position:0%
receive inadequate
 
05:55:32.628 --> 05:55:32.638 align:start position:0%
reimbursement also under such systems
 
05:55:34.990 --> 05:55:35.000 align:start position:0%
people lose their choices choices they
 
05:55:37.310 --> 05:55:37.320 align:start position:0%
lose choice
 
05:55:39.868 --> 05:55:39.878 align:start position:0%
when they go to Single Payer in these
 
05:55:42.590 --> 05:55:42.600 align:start position:0%
other countries and a lack of
 
05:55:45.310 --> 05:55:45.320 align:start position:0%
competition and a lack of choice lessens
 
05:55:47.150 --> 05:55:47.160 align:start position:0%
the pressures on
 
05:55:50.230 --> 05:55:50.240 align:start position:0%
providers to perform or to
 
05:55:52.990 --> 05:55:53.000 align:start position:0%
innovate rationing is Common Place in
 
05:55:54.628 --> 05:55:54.638 align:start position:0%
many of these countries we just have to
 
05:55:56.230 --> 05:55:56.240 align:start position:0%
look where this has been tried and what
 
05:55:59.510 --> 05:55:59.520 align:start position:0%
ha what's happened time and time
 
05:56:02.070 --> 05:56:02.080 align:start position:0%
again we've all heard the horror stories
 
05:56:04.628 --> 05:56:04.638 align:start position:0%
and they're real people who died in
 
05:56:08.110 --> 05:56:08.120 align:start position:0%
these other countries waiting for for
 
05:56:10.230 --> 05:56:10.240 align:start position:0%
treatment because they couldn't get
 
05:56:13.190 --> 05:56:13.200 align:start position:0%
scheduled tellingly countless people
 
05:56:14.830 --> 05:56:14.840 align:start position:0%
from other countries with national
 
05:56:17.350 --> 05:56:17.360 align:start position:0%
health insurance come to America they
 
05:56:19.150 --> 05:56:19.160 align:start position:0%
come here from these other countries
 
05:56:21.548 --> 05:56:21.558 align:start position:0%
that have National Insurance and they
 
05:56:23.910 --> 05:56:23.920 align:start position:0%
they're in line they can't get help for
 
05:56:27.030 --> 05:56:27.040 align:start position:0%
important treatments they come
 
05:56:30.150 --> 05:56:30.160 align:start position:0%
here and with our current open
 
05:56:32.830 --> 05:56:32.840 align:start position:0%
borders we have millions of people
 
05:56:35.948 --> 05:56:35.958 align:start position:0%
busting in here and overwhelming what we
 
05:56:37.230 --> 05:56:37.240 align:start position:0%
current currently have in terms of
 
05:56:39.628 --> 05:56:39.638 align:start position:0%
emergency room treatment and yet many of
 
05:56:41.830 --> 05:56:41.840 align:start position:0%
the proponents of national health
 
05:56:44.510 --> 05:56:44.520 align:start position:0%
insurance want to include undocumented
 
05:56:47.510 --> 05:56:47.520 align:start position:0%
migrants in this plan that is a sure way
 
05:56:49.510 --> 05:56:49.520 align:start position:0%
to overwhelm what's already a system
 
05:56:53.270 --> 05:56:53.280 align:start position:0%
that's that's stressed so poll after
 
05:56:56.830 --> 05:56:56.840 align:start position:0%
poll shows a majority of Americans to be
 
05:56:59.190 --> 05:56:59.200 align:start position:0%
satisfied with the plans they have in
 
05:57:02.270 --> 05:57:02.280 align:start position:0%
place I am and probably most of you are
 
05:57:05.628 --> 05:57:05.638 align:start position:0%
so why do we want to change that
 
05:57:08.230 --> 05:57:08.240 align:start position:0%
drastically like I said the the things
 
05:57:11.990 --> 05:57:12.000 align:start position:0%
need attention but we need to revamp we
 
05:57:14.868 --> 05:57:14.878 align:start position:0%
don't need to replace our current
 
05:57:19.070 --> 05:57:19.080 align:start position:0%

members of the house I rise in support
 
05:57:38.468 --> 05:57:38.478 align:start position:0%
of hr20 three calling on our federal
 
05:57:40.510 --> 05:57:40.520 align:start position:0%
delegation to support a national
 
05:57:42.948 --> 05:57:42.958 align:start position:0%
universal health insurance
 
05:57:45.910 --> 05:57:45.920 align:start position:0%
program our complicated wasteful health
 
05:57:48.110 --> 05:57:48.120 align:start position:0%
insurance system is a
 
05:57:50.990 --> 05:57:51.000 align:start position:0%
catastrophe we spend more on health care
 
05:57:54.390 --> 05:57:54.400 align:start position:0%
per capita than any country on Earth and
 
05:57:56.830 --> 05:57:56.840 align:start position:0%
have the worst Health
 
05:57:59.150 --> 05:57:59.160 align:start position:0%
outcomes it's true what is said that
 
05:58:01.230 --> 05:58:01.240 align:start position:0%
people come from all over the world to
 
05:58:03.948 --> 05:58:03.958 align:start position:0%
access American Health Care but wealthy
 
05:58:07.070 --> 05:58:07.080 align:start position:0%
people paying cash for the best doctors
 
05:58:09.110 --> 05:58:09.120 align:start position:0%
in the world is not the same thing as
 
05:58:11.070 --> 05:58:11.080 align:start position:0%
people coming here to buy Private health
 
05:58:13.070 --> 05:58:13.080 align:start position:0%
insurance they
 
05:58:16.270 --> 05:58:16.280 align:start position:0%
don't opponents of the resolution state
 
05:58:18.350 --> 05:58:18.360 align:start position:0%
that many citizens are happy with their
 
05:58:18.360 --> 05:58:19.430 align:start position:0%
that many citizens are happy with their
current

05:58:19.430 --> 05:58:19.440 align:start position:0%
current
 
05:58:22.070 --> 05:58:22.080 align:start position:0%
Arrangements no one testified at the
 
05:58:23.590 --> 05:58:23.600 align:start position:0%
hearing that they love their private
 
05:58:26.390 --> 05:58:26.400 align:start position:0%
health insurance on the contrary we
 
05:58:29.468 --> 05:58:29.478 align:start position:0%
heard many stories of necessary Health
 
05:58:33.270 --> 05:58:33.280 align:start position:0%
Care being denied and being too
 
05:58:35.590 --> 05:58:35.600 align:start position:0%
expensive two members of the committee
 
05:58:37.350 --> 05:58:37.360 align:start position:0%
who said they were happy with their
 
05:58:37.360 --> 05:58:38.510 align:start position:0%
who said they were happy with their
health

05:58:38.510 --> 05:58:38.520 align:start position:0%
health
 
05:58:42.310 --> 05:58:42.320 align:start position:0%
insurance actually have national
 
05:58:45.750 --> 05:58:45.760 align:start position:0%
government run Single Payer Health
 
05:58:49.390 --> 05:58:49.400 align:start position:0%
insurance that would be TR care and
 
05:58:52.788 --> 05:58:52.798 align:start position:0%
Medicare yes people on those plans are
 
05:58:55.868 --> 05:58:55.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:59.510 --> 05:58:59.520 align:start position:0%
it why with Single Payer you can go to
 
05:59:04.628 --> 05:59:04.638 align:start position:0%
any provider you want private public or
 
05:59:08.230 --> 05:59:08.240 align:start position:0%
nonprofit people ask how can we afford a
 
05:59:10.548 --> 05:59:10.558 align:start position:0%
national health insurance program but
 
05:59:13.708 --> 05:59:13.718 align:start position:0%
the real question is how can we afford
 
05:59:16.868 --> 05:59:16.878 align:start position:0%
not to have one the Crux of the matter
 
05:59:18.830 --> 05:59:18.840 align:start position:0%
is that is that we have two separate
 
05:59:22.150 --> 05:59:22.160 align:start position:0%
risk pools for health insurance one is
 
05:59:25.110 --> 05:59:25.120 align:start position:0%
the low-risk pool the healthy working
 
05:59:28.150 --> 05:59:28.160 align:start position:0%
adult population and their children few
 
05:59:30.670 --> 05:59:30.680 align:start position:0%
of whom have any major medical problems
 
05:59:30.680 --> 05:59:31.510 align:start position:0%
of whom have any major medical problems
or

05:59:31.510 --> 05:59:31.520 align:start position:0%
or
 
05:59:35.270 --> 05:59:35.280 align:start position:0%
expenses the other is the high risk pool
 
05:59:37.910 --> 05:59:37.920 align:start position:0%
who's in that pool everyone with a
 
05:59:40.548 --> 05:59:40.558 align:start position:0%
disability they're automatically on
 
05:59:43.548 --> 05:59:43.558 align:start position:0%
Medicare any child with a major medical
 
05:59:45.468 --> 05:59:45.478 align:start position:0%
problem automatically on the chip
 
05:59:48.430 --> 05:59:48.440 align:start position:0%
program regardless of their income level
 
05:59:50.548 --> 05:59:50.558 align:start position:0%
all the poor they're on
 
05:59:54.070 --> 05:59:54.080 align:start position:0%
Medicaid and most importantly the
 
05:59:57.030 --> 05:59:57.040 align:start position:0%
elderly they're on Medicare Who as a
 
06:00:00.070 --> 06:00:00.080 align:start position:0%
group have the highest health costs and
 
06:00:02.310 --> 06:00:02.320 align:start position:0%
the highest prescription drug cost of
 
06:00:03.590 --> 06:00:03.600 align:start position:0%
any other
 
06:00:06.868 --> 06:00:06.878 align:start position:0%
group so the private sector
 
06:00:10.150 --> 06:00:10.160 align:start position:0%
has the luxury of ensuring the low-risk
 
06:00:13.628 --> 06:00:13.638 align:start position:0%
pool at and making huge profits at it
 
06:00:16.190 --> 06:00:16.200 align:start position:0%
but the government is tasked with
 
06:00:19.030 --> 06:00:19.040 align:start position:0%
ensuring the high-risk
 
06:00:22.030 --> 06:00:22.040 align:start position:0%
pool most of us are going to pay Private
 
06:00:25.270 --> 06:00:25.280 align:start position:0%
health insurance for 50 years our entire
 
06:00:28.070 --> 06:00:28.080 align:start position:0%
working lives we going to pay into that
 
06:00:31.270 --> 06:00:31.280 align:start position:0%
year after year and not one penny of
 
06:00:34.070 --> 06:00:34.080 align:start position:0%
that money goes into the pool to take
 
06:00:37.670 --> 06:00:37.680 align:start position:0%
care of us when we're old we hit 65 and
 
06:00:39.628 --> 06:00:39.638 align:start position:0%
we're dropped like a hot potato and have
 
06:00:43.390 --> 06:00:43.400 align:start position:0%
to go on Medicare so I ask you how is
 
06:00:43.400 --> 06:00:44.230 align:start position:0%
to go on Medicare so I ask you how is
this

06:00:44.230 --> 06:00:44.240 align:start position:0%
this
 
06:00:46.468 --> 06:00:46.478 align:start position:0%
sustainable how can the government
 
06:00:49.390 --> 06:00:49.400 align:start position:0%
possibly keep that up you want to cut
 
06:00:51.990 --> 06:00:52.000 align:start position:0%
national debt have national health
 
06:00:53.670 --> 06:00:53.680 align:start position:0%
insurance and we all increase our
 
06:00:56.430 --> 06:00:56.440 align:start position:0%
contribution from the 2 to 3% We already
 
06:00:57.868 --> 06:00:57.878 align:start position:0%
pay to
 
06:01:01.070 --> 06:01:01.080 align:start position:0%
5% that would be much less expensive for
 
06:01:03.708 --> 06:01:03.718 align:start position:0%
you and your employer who are now paying
 
06:01:07.750 --> 06:01:07.760 align:start position:0%
12 to 20% of every salary into Private
 
06:01:07.760 --> 06:01:09.150 align:start position:0%
12 to 20% of every salary into Private
health

06:01:09.150 --> 06:01:09.160 align:start position:0%
health
 
06:01:12.910 --> 06:01:12.920 align:start position:0%
insurance if we combined risk pools like
 
06:01:15.670 --> 06:01:15.680 align:start position:0%
every other country in the world we
 
06:01:18.190 --> 06:01:18.200 align:start position:0%
could afford to provide long-term care
 
06:01:21.948 --> 06:01:21.958 align:start position:0%
insurance for the elderly who need it as
 
06:01:24.510 --> 06:01:24.520 align:start position:0%
it is now ordinary working and middle
 
06:01:27.190 --> 06:01:27.200 align:start position:0%
class people who have the misfortune of
 
06:01:29.910 --> 06:01:29.920 align:start position:0%
prolonged age related disability or
 
06:01:32.310 --> 06:01:32.320 align:start position:0%
dementia are forced to spend their
 
06:01:36.150 --> 06:01:36.160 align:start position:0%
entire life savings sell their homes
 
06:01:38.708 --> 06:01:38.718 align:start position:0%
leave nothing for their children just to
 
06:01:40.788 --> 06:01:40.798 align:start position:0%
pay for their long-term
 
06:01:43.868 --> 06:01:43.878 align:start position:0%
care and that is because we have allowed
 
06:01:46.350 --> 06:01:46.360 align:start position:0%
private insurance companies to profit
 
06:01:48.628 --> 06:01:48.638 align:start position:0%
from uring them their entire working
 
06:01:51.628 --> 06:01:51.638 align:start position:0%
lives and contribute nothing for their
 
06:01:55.190 --> 06:01:55.200 align:start position:0%
care when they're old a national health
 
06:01:58.548 --> 06:01:58.558 align:start position:0%
insurance uh plan would allow us to have
 
06:02:01.430 --> 06:02:01.440 align:start position:0%
long-term care for our seniors and we
 
06:02:04.510 --> 06:02:04.520 align:start position:0%
would no longer need Medicare
 
06:02:08.468 --> 06:02:08.478 align:start position:0%
supplements or the the awful Advantage
 
06:02:11.548 --> 06:02:11.558 align:start position:0%
Plans we need to do it and it must be
 
06:02:14.390 --> 06:02:14.400 align:start position:0%
done at the federal level which is why
 
06:02:17.910 --> 06:02:17.920 align:start position:0%
this is a health of house
 
06:02:20.830 --> 06:02:20.840 align:start position:0%
resolution aside from the elderly what's
 
06:02:24.230 --> 06:02:24.240 align:start position:0%
in it for young people personal freedom
 
06:02:26.270 --> 06:02:26.280 align:start position:0%
is one of the reasons I am in favor of a
 
06:02:29.030 --> 06:02:29.040 align:start position:0%
national health insurance plan you could
 
06:02:31.708 --> 06:02:31.718 align:start position:0%
pursue the job you love not just the job
 
06:02:34.270 --> 06:02:34.280 align:start position:0%
that has benefits you could start a
 
06:02:36.350 --> 06:02:36.360 align:start position:0%
small business without wor woring how
 
06:02:37.948 --> 06:02:37.958 align:start position:0%
you going to have health insurance for
 
06:02:40.390 --> 06:02:40.400 align:start position:0%
yourself let alone your
 
06:02:42.990 --> 06:02:43.000 align:start position:0%
employees Single Payer will easily
 
06:02:46.270 --> 06:02:46.280 align:start position:0%
easily provide insurance for Gig workers
 
06:02:48.910 --> 06:02:48.920 align:start position:0%
who are often the ones who have no
 
06:02:51.468 --> 06:02:51.478 align:start position:0%
insurance and instead of bargaining over
 
06:02:54.390 --> 06:02:54.400 align:start position:0%
Health Plans Union unions can focus on
 
06:02:57.110 --> 06:02:57.120 align:start position:0%
better wages working conditions and
 
06:02:57.120 --> 06:02:58.430 align:start position:0%
better wages working conditions and
retirement

06:02:58.430 --> 06:02:58.440 align:start position:0%
retirement
 
06:03:01.830 --> 06:03:01.840 align:start position:0%
plans Single Payer would also benefit
 
06:03:04.670 --> 06:03:04.680 align:start position:0%
manufacturers who are trying to compete
 
06:03:06.830 --> 06:03:06.840 align:start position:0%
with companies and other other countries
 
06:03:08.868 --> 06:03:08.878 align:start position:0%
in fact almost every other country in
 
06:03:11.468 --> 06:03:11.478 align:start position:0%
the world where companies do not have to
 
06:03:14.628 --> 06:03:14.638 align:start position:0%
pay for insurance for their employees it
 
06:03:16.628 --> 06:03:16.638 align:start position:0%
would make us more competitive in the
 
06:03:16.638 --> 06:03:17.788 align:start position:0%
would make us more competitive in the
global

06:03:17.788 --> 06:03:17.798 align:start position:0%
global
 
06:03:21.030 --> 06:03:21.040 align:start position:0%
economy but let's be clear we do not
 
06:03:23.750 --> 06:03:23.760 align:start position:0%
have a free market in health insurance
 
06:03:26.628 --> 06:03:26.638 align:start position:0%
we don't have choice if you get coverage
 
06:03:28.590 --> 06:03:28.600 align:start position:0%
through your job your employer picks a
 
06:03:31.628 --> 06:03:31.638 align:start position:0%
plan you don't have any say about it and
 
06:03:33.310 --> 06:03:33.320 align:start position:0%
if you buy it through the marketplace
 
06:03:36.910 --> 06:03:36.920 align:start position:0%
you really only have one option
 
06:03:39.468 --> 06:03:39.478 align:start position:0%
and providers are severely restricted by
 
06:03:42.510 --> 06:03:42.520 align:start position:0%
networks you can't choose which doctor
 
06:03:45.230 --> 06:03:45.240 align:start position:0%
you go to your insurance plan chooses
 
06:03:47.070 --> 06:03:47.080 align:start position:0%
that for
 
06:03:50.590 --> 06:03:50.600 align:start position:0%
you and also why isn't Medicaid
 
06:03:53.510 --> 06:03:53.520 align:start position:0%
expansion enough why do we need Single
 
06:03:57.430 --> 06:03:57.440 align:start position:0%
Payer I don't like the Medicaid Program
 
06:03:59.868 --> 06:03:59.878 align:start position:0%
and don't misunderstand me I would never
 
06:04:01.990 --> 06:04:02.000 align:start position:0%
vote to take it away from anyone until
 
06:04:05.150 --> 06:04:05.160 align:start position:0%
we have another option but Medicaid
 
06:04:08.110 --> 06:04:08.120 align:start position:0%
entails enormous administrative C costs
 
06:04:09.788 --> 06:04:09.798 align:start position:0%
to screen for income and you have to
 
06:04:12.868 --> 06:04:12.878 align:start position:0%
keep doing it over and over again it's
 
06:04:15.468 --> 06:04:15.478 align:start position:0%
also tedious to apply for it and that's
 
06:04:17.590 --> 06:04:17.600 align:start position:0%
a barrier to
 
06:04:20.110 --> 06:04:20.120 align:start position:0%
participation and it's a literal barrier
 
06:04:22.910 --> 06:04:22.920 align:start position:0%
to access because many doctors simply
 
06:04:25.708 --> 06:04:25.718 align:start position:0%
won't accept Medicaid
 
06:04:28.708 --> 06:04:28.718 align:start position:0%
patients and it's a disincentive to work
 
06:04:31.390 --> 06:04:31.400 align:start position:0%
or an incentive to work under the table
 
06:04:32.830 --> 06:04:32.840 align:start position:0%
because if you start to make a little
 
06:04:34.628 --> 06:04:34.638 align:start position:0%
more money you're going to lose your
 
06:04:34.638 --> 06:04:36.190 align:start position:0%
more money you're going to lose your
insurance

06:04:36.190 --> 06:04:36.200 align:start position:0%
insurance
 
06:04:39.230 --> 06:04:39.240 align:start position:0%
if we opened up Medicare for all for
 
06:04:42.070 --> 06:04:42.080 align:start position:0%
example we could do away with Medicaid
 
06:04:45.910 --> 06:04:45.920 align:start position:0%
Al together and save a lot of
 
06:04:50.868 --> 06:04:50.878 align:start position:0%
money Medicare and tri care are national
 
06:04:54.110 --> 06:04:54.120 align:start position:0%
government run single-payer Health Care
 
06:04:56.750 --> 06:04:56.760 align:start position:0%
Systems and they work very
 
06:05:00.070 --> 06:05:00.080 align:start position:0%
well they are more efficient than other
 
06:05:02.670 --> 06:05:02.680 align:start position:0%
private than private insurance companies
 
06:05:08.270 --> 06:05:08.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:13.190 --> 06:05:13.200 align:start position:0%
% most importantly it will allow us to
 
06:05:15.868 --> 06:05:15.878 align:start position:0%
prioritize reimbursement for Primary
 
06:05:19.190 --> 06:05:19.200 align:start position:0%
Care which the private insurance Market
 
06:05:22.510 --> 06:05:22.520 align:start position:0%
does not do which is why we have a
 
06:05:26.468 --> 06:05:26.478 align:start position:0%
crisis of primary care in this
 
06:05:31.110 --> 06:05:31.120 align:start position:0%
country my husband's doctor retired last
 
06:05:33.948 --> 06:05:33.958 align:start position:0%
year it took him four months to find a
 
06:05:36.110 --> 06:05:36.120 align:start position:0%
doctor that was even accepting new
 
06:05:39.030 --> 06:05:39.040 align:start position:0%
patients for Primary Care and the first
 
06:05:41.830 --> 06:05:41.840 align:start position:0%
appointment he get he could get is still
 
06:05:45.990 --> 06:05:46.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:49.190 --> 06:05:49.200 align:start position:0%
away so the other important thing about
 
06:05:50.868 --> 06:05:50.878 align:start position:0%
a national
 
06:05:53.468 --> 06:05:53.478 align:start position:0%
insurance program it was it would mean
 
06:05:55.708 --> 06:05:55.718 align:start position:0%
Managed Care could be about providing
 
06:05:58.350 --> 06:05:58.360 align:start position:0%
best medical practices and not just
 
06:06:00.830 --> 06:06:00.840 align:start position:0%
maximizing shareholder
 
06:06:04.708 --> 06:06:04.718 align:start position:0%
profits this is not socialized medicine
 
06:06:07.948 --> 06:06:07.958 align:start position:0%
it is just the insurance you can still
 
06:06:11.390 --> 06:06:11.400 align:start position:0%
go to whatever doctor you want
 
06:06:13.910 --> 06:06:13.920 align:start position:0%
to it will cost the state of New
 
06:06:13.920 --> 06:06:15.548 align:start position:0%
to it will cost the state of New
Hampshire

06:06:15.548 --> 06:06:15.558 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
06:06:18.910 --> 06:06:18.920 align:start position:0%
nothing and as for illegal immigrants if
 
06:06:21.430 --> 06:06:21.440 align:start position:0%
you don't have a Social Security card
 
06:06:23.468 --> 06:06:23.478 align:start position:0%
you wouldn't get a national insurance
 
06:06:23.478 --> 06:06:24.750 align:start position:0%
you wouldn't get a national insurance
card

06:06:24.750 --> 06:06:24.760 align:start position:0%
card
 
06:06:28.628 --> 06:06:28.638 align:start position:0%
either so I urge you all to vote oh or
 
06:06:31.310 --> 06:06:31.320 align:start position:0%
to pass on this resolution and I ask for
 
06:06:34.510 --> 06:06:34.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:34.520 --> 06:06:36.708 align:start position:0%

06:09:02.310 --> 06:09:02.320 align:start position:0%
inquiry thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker
 
06:09:04.868 --> 06:09:04.878 align:start position:0%
if I know that most Granite Staters
 
06:09:07.350 --> 06:09:07.360 align:start position:0%
would be unable to afford or even
 
06:09:10.030 --> 06:09:10.040 align:start position:0%
severely set back by needing to pay
 
06:09:10.040 --> 06:09:10.948 align:start position:0%
severely set back by needing to pay
nearly

06:09:10.948 --> 06:09:10.958 align:start position:0%
nearly
 
06:09:13.670 --> 06:09:13.680 align:start position:0%
$7,000 or more a year to their
 
06:09:16.070 --> 06:09:16.080 align:start position:0%
employer's choice of high deductible
 
06:09:18.750 --> 06:09:18.760 align:start position:0%
medical plan in addition to already
 
06:09:21.590 --> 06:09:21.600 align:start position:0%
paying co-pays and premiums and if I
 
06:09:25.628 --> 06:09:25.638 align:start position:0%
know under our current system year after
 
06:09:27.868 --> 06:09:27.878 align:start position:0%
year these same Granite Staters have
 
06:09:30.350 --> 06:09:30.360 align:start position:0%
seen an increase in cost while at the
 
06:09:33.030 --> 06:09:33.040 align:start position:0%
very same time seeing a decrease in
 
06:09:36.910 --> 06:09:36.920 align:start position:0%
benefit coverage and if I also know that
 
06:09:39.468 --> 06:09:39.478 align:start position:0%
we as a country are fully capable of
 
06:09:41.628 --> 06:09:41.638 align:start position:0%
figuring out a unique system that works
 
06:09:43.948 --> 06:09:43.958 align:start position:0%
for us regardless of what other
 
06:09:46.788 --> 06:09:46.798 align:start position:0%
countries have already done and finally
 
06:09:49.510 --> 06:09:49.520 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker if I know that preventative
 
06:09:51.830 --> 06:09:51.840 align:start position:0%
health care has been shown to not only
 
06:09:54.788 --> 06:09:54.798 align:start position:0%
lengthen lives but also decrease health
 
06:09:58.030 --> 06:09:58.040 align:start position:0%
care costs over time would I press the
 
06:10:00.788 --> 06:10:00.798 align:start position:0%
red button to overturn this indefinite
 
06:10:03.310 --> 06:10:03.320 align:start position:0%
postponement motion and allow another
 
06:10:05.468 --> 06:10:05.478 align:start position:0%
motion to be made so that hopefully New
 
06:10:07.190 --> 06:10:07.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire can send a strongly worded
 
06:10:08.948 --> 06:10:08.958 align:start position:0%
message to our federal government that
 
06:10:12.350 --> 06:10:12.360 align:start position:0%
our state expects a solution to be found
 
06:10:12.360 --> 06:10:18.390 align:start position:0%
our state expects a solution to be found

you chair recognized representative Lin

measure is not just about climate change
 
06:16:36.350 --> 06:16:36.360 align:start position:0%
It ultimately seeks to undermine how we

currently conduct everyday business here
 
06:16:40.868 --> 06:16:40.878 align:start position:0%

hearing both sides of an issue before
 
06:16:45.510 --> 06:16:45.520 align:start position:0%
weighing the decision is essential in

ensuring the fairness of the
 
06:16:49.788 --> 06:16:49.798 align:start position:0%

and consider multiple perspectives On
 
06:17:03.430 --> 06:17:03.440 align:start position:0%
Any Given issue and allow stakeholders
 
06:17:06.310 --> 06:17:06.320 align:start position:0%
to present their arguments and evidence
 
06:17:08.190 --> 06:17:08.200 align:start position:0%
in parliamentary proceedings the
 
06:17:09.948 --> 06:17:09.958 align:start position:0%
practice of hearing both sides of an
 
06:17:12.190 --> 06:17:12.200 align:start position:0%
issue before weighing a decision
 
06:17:14.230 --> 06:17:14.240 align:start position:0%

giant paintings up here in this H we all

look at you see uh Webster Pierce
 
06:17:43.230 --> 06:17:43.240 align:start position:0%
Washington Lincoln but who's this other
 
06:17:45.628 --> 06:17:45.638 align:start position:0%
guy well a lot of you may not know
 
06:17:47.270 --> 06:17:47.280 align:start position:0%
that's Senator John P hail he's an
 
06:17:48.910 --> 06:17:48.920 align:start position:0%
abolitionist US senator who served
 
06:17:51.948 --> 06:17:51.958 align:start position:0%
during the Civil War uh but many many of
 
06:17:55.110 --> 06:17:55.120 align:start position:0%
you may not know is that his daughter
 
06:17:57.590 --> 06:17:57.600 align:start position:0%
Lucy uh was engaged to one of the most
 
06:18:00.070 --> 06:18:00.080 align:start position:0%
famous actors of the time during the
 
06:18:03.430 --> 06:18:03.440 align:start position:0%
Civil War uh hail's that guy's future
 
06:18:05.788 --> 06:18:05.798 align:start position:0%
son-in-law was a guy named John wils
 
06:18:08.390 --> 06:18:08.400 align:start position:0%
Booth yeah the same guy who assassinated
 
06:18:12.030 --> 06:18:12.040 align:start position:0%
that guy Abraham Lincoln Booth had
 
06:18:14.390 --> 06:18:14.400 align:start position:0%
Lucy's picture near his heart when he
 
06:18:17.070 --> 06:18:17.080 align:start position:0%
was shot dead in 1865 Lucy quickly moved
 
06:18:19.150 --> 06:18:19.160 align:start position:0%
from New Hampshire to Europe so what
 
06:18:20.350 --> 06:18:20.360 align:start position:0%
what does this little history lesson
 
06:18:21.948 --> 06:18:21.958 align:start position:0%
have to do with climate change the point
 
06:18:24.628 --> 06:18:24.638 align:start position:0%
is that some information some history
 
06:18:27.190 --> 06:18:27.200 align:start position:0%
some facts can be uncomfortable uh
 
06:18:30.350 --> 06:18:30.360 align:start position:0%
inconvenient to acknowledge such as the
 
06:18:32.390 --> 06:18:32.400 align:start position:0%
relationship between Lucy hail and John
 
06:18:34.350 --> 06:18:34.360 align:start position:0%
wils Booth and similarly there's a lack
 
06:18:37.110 --> 06:18:37.120 align:start position:0%
of uh climate information total climate
 
06:18:39.628 --> 06:18:39.638 align:start position:0%
information history and facts uh that
 
06:18:41.910 --> 06:18:41.920 align:start position:0%
need to be better presented many years
 
06:18:44.270 --> 06:18:44.280 align:start position:0%
ago as a un freshman I took a a course
 
06:18:46.708 --> 06:18:46.718 align:start position:0%
in this and I was scared to death and
 
06:18:48.548 --> 06:18:48.558 align:start position:0%
yet I went back and found the book The
 
06:18:50.230 --> 06:18:50.240 align:start position:0%
Textbook that I was giv way back then
 
06:18:52.590 --> 06:18:52.600 align:start position:0%
and in the predictions and the Doomsday
 
06:18:55.788 --> 06:18:55.798 align:start position:0%
scenarios uh didn't come true this is in
 
06:18:58.750 --> 06:18:58.760 align:start position:0%
the 70s so those of us who make laws or
 
06:19:00.750 --> 06:19:00.760 align:start position:0%
pressured by activists to take climate
 
06:19:03.468 --> 06:19:03.478 align:start position:0%
Action Now climate action now or else
 
06:19:06.110 --> 06:19:06.120 align:start position:0%
we're doomed now some states have law
 
06:19:08.350 --> 06:19:08.360 align:start position:0%
have already passed laws to uh
 
06:19:10.948 --> 06:19:10.958 align:start position:0%
California is you can't you can't drive
 
06:19:13.270 --> 06:19:13.280 align:start position:0%
a gas powered vehicle there past the
 
06:19:15.350 --> 06:19:15.360 align:start position:0%
date certain other states are doing the
 
06:19:17.110 --> 06:19:17.120 align:start position:0%
same thing they're getting rid of gas
 
06:19:19.430 --> 06:19:19.440 align:start position:0%
stoves uh they're mandating electric
 
06:19:21.670 --> 06:19:21.680 align:start position:0%
school buses military jets they they're
 
06:19:24.110 --> 06:19:24.120 align:start position:0%
trying to get military jets to use
 
06:19:26.310 --> 06:19:26.320 align:start position:0%
organic fuel way more
 
06:19:28.310 --> 06:19:28.320 align:start position:0%
expensive we've had bills in this
 
06:19:30.868 --> 06:19:30.878 align:start position:0%
chamber to Outlaw wood stes and on and
 
06:19:34.350 --> 06:19:34.360 align:start position:0%
on but does hysterical climate activism
 
06:19:36.270 --> 06:19:36.280 align:start position:0%
yield good public policy that's what
 
06:19:39.948 --> 06:19:39.958 align:start position:0%
we're all about is laws public policy
 
06:19:42.070 --> 06:19:42.080 align:start position:0%
will carbon
 
06:19:45.468 --> 06:19:45.478 align:start position:0%
taxes on granite Staters stop climate
 
06:19:48.230 --> 06:19:48.240 align:start position:0%
change will carbon taxes on us stop
 
06:19:50.070 --> 06:19:50.080 align:start position:0%
climate change activists often cite
 
06:19:52.350 --> 06:19:52.360 align:start position:0%
scientific consensus that's the point of
 
06:19:56.590 --> 06:19:56.600 align:start position:0%
this measure uh not every voice is being
 
06:19:59.310 --> 06:19:59.320 align:start position:0%
listened to or heard to many scientists
 
06:20:01.190 --> 06:20:01.200 align:start position:0%
are being bullied the American
 
06:20:03.230 --> 06:20:03.240 align:start position:0%
Meteorological Society did a member
 
06:20:05.788 --> 06:20:05.798 align:start position:0%
survey and received
 
06:20:10.230 --> 06:20:10.240 align:start position:0%
1862 responses only 52% of those felt
 
06:20:11.868 --> 06:20:11.878 align:start position:0%
that 20th
 
06:20:14.990 --> 06:20:15.000 align:start position:0%
century uh Global emissions had anything
 
06:20:17.590 --> 06:20:17.600 align:start position:0%
to do with with global warming that's a
 
06:20:20.110 --> 06:20:20.120 align:start position:0%
far cry from the 97% figure we keep
 
06:20:22.190 --> 06:20:22.200 align:start position:0%
hearing in terms of scientists who
 
06:20:26.190 --> 06:20:26.200 align:start position:0%
supposedly blame humans for clim climate
 
06:20:28.548 --> 06:20:28.558 align:start position:0%
change so this brings us to the purpose
 
06:20:31.468 --> 06:20:31.478 align:start position:0%
of this resolution which simply states
 
06:20:34.628 --> 06:20:34.638 align:start position:0%
which simply calls for all voices to be
 
06:20:37.350 --> 06:20:37.360 align:start position:0%
be heard as we develop climate policies
 
06:20:40.548 --> 06:20:40.558 align:start position:0%
in this body and elsewhere experts who
 
06:20:42.708 --> 06:20:42.718 align:start position:0%
are being threatened and ignored deserve
 
06:20:45.948 --> 06:20:45.958 align:start position:0%
to be heard and we need to stop scaring
 
06:20:47.628 --> 06:20:47.638 align:start position:0%
the heck out of our kids the way that
 
06:20:49.510 --> 06:20:49.520 align:start position:0%
they scared the heck out of me at UNH
 
06:20:51.190 --> 06:20:51.200 align:start position:0%
when I was a freshman
 
06:20:54.468 --> 06:20:54.478 align:start position:0%
there most agree that measured most of
 
06:20:56.350 --> 06:20:56.360 align:start position:0%
us agree that measured insensible
 
06:20:58.590 --> 06:20:58.600 align:start position:0%
reductions in fossil fuel Em missals are
 
06:21:00.948 --> 06:21:00.958 align:start position:0%
are desirable and we can do that by
 
06:21:00.958 --> 06:21:02.230 align:start position:0%
are desirable and we can do that by
working

06:21:02.230 --> 06:21:02.240 align:start position:0%
working
 
06:21:04.910 --> 06:21:04.920 align:start position:0%
together the EPA was established under
 
06:21:07.350 --> 06:21:07.360 align:start position:0%
Republican Administration and together
 
06:21:08.868 --> 06:21:08.878 align:start position:0%
together we've cleaned our lakes and
 
06:21:10.750 --> 06:21:10.760 align:start position:0%
rivers we've cleaned our air I if you
 
06:21:12.190 --> 06:21:12.200 align:start position:0%
remember how bad it was in New York City
 
06:21:15.070 --> 06:21:15.080 align:start position:0%
or La we've worked together to fix or to
 
06:21:17.990 --> 06:21:18.000 align:start position:0%
ameliorate that stuff for decades but
 
06:21:20.190 --> 06:21:20.200 align:start position:0%
climate scientists who shut down debate
 
06:21:22.990 --> 06:21:23.000 align:start position:0%
and try to impose radical measures
 
06:21:26.310 --> 06:21:26.320 align:start position:0%
promote bad policies we're under in
 
06:21:28.150 --> 06:21:28.160 align:start position:0%
incredible pressure schools are under
 
06:21:30.708 --> 06:21:30.718 align:start position:0%
pressure to start teaching
 
06:21:34.788 --> 06:21:34.798 align:start position:0%
climate is part of uh schools is a h sh
 
06:21:36.910 --> 06:21:36.920 align:start position:0%
30 coming up from another committee so
 
06:21:40.070 --> 06:21:40.080 align:start position:0%
anyway this regul this resolution simply
 
06:21:42.788 --> 06:21:42.798 align:start position:0%
calls for us to listen to All voices and
 
06:21:44.990 --> 06:21:45.000 align:start position:0%
if that seems reasonable and by the way
 
06:21:46.190 --> 06:21:46.200 align:start position:0%
there was no if you notice in the
 
06:21:49.948 --> 06:21:49.958 align:start position:0%
calendar there was no contrary Minority
 
06:21:52.750 --> 06:21:52.760 align:start position:0%
Report uh who wants to step up and say
 
06:21:54.990 --> 06:21:55.000 align:start position:0%
not to listen to All
 
06:21:57.030 --> 06:21:57.040 align:start position:0%
voices so if you want to listen to All
 
06:21:59.628 --> 06:21:59.638 align:start position:0%
voices as we put together policy then I
 
06:22:01.990 --> 06:22:02.000 align:start position:0%
asked you to hit the green the Celtic

06:23:18.390 --> 06:23:18.400 align:start position:0%
thought I saw more than 10 votes can we
 
06:23:21.110 --> 06:23:21.120 align:start position:0%
I did not count 10 votes in their seat
 
06:23:23.990 --> 06:23:24.000 align:start position:0%
and they had to be in their seats and
 
06:23:27.310 --> 06:23:27.320 align:start position:0%
they it took maybe two minutes for
 
06:23:30.230 --> 06:23:30.240 align:start position:0%
everybody to stand up when we ask for a
 
06:23:32.708 --> 06:23:32.718 align:start position:0%

hcr9 resins an application for an
 
06:26:39.788 --> 06:26:39.798 align:start position:0%
article 5 Constitutional
 
06:26:41.750 --> 06:26:41.760 align:start position:0%
Convention you've probably heard from
 
06:26:43.030 --> 06:26:43.040 align:start position:0%
people claiming that an article 5
 
06:26:46.430 --> 06:26:46.440 align:start position:0%
convention experts from experts uh that
 
06:26:48.430 --> 06:26:48.440 align:start position:0%
an article 5 convention is a well
 
06:26:50.030 --> 06:26:50.040 align:start position:0%
understood process and that it can be
 
06:26:53.070 --> 06:26:53.080 align:start position:0%
issue specific um I want to try to
 
06:26:58.150 --> 06:26:58.160 align:start position:0%
convince people in uh in in my view that
 
06:27:01.510 --> 06:27:01.520 align:start position:0%
uh this this is not the case okay so I
 
06:27:03.548 --> 06:27:03.558 align:start position:0%
want you guys to do me a favor and if
 
06:27:05.468 --> 06:27:05.478 align:start position:0%
you can go on your cellular telephones
 
06:27:07.270 --> 06:27:07.280 align:start position:0%
just read article 5 of the US
 
06:27:09.070 --> 06:27:09.080 align:start position:0%
Constitution I'm not going to wait for
 
06:27:11.548 --> 06:27:11.558 align:start position:0%
you um but I have a couple questions for
 
06:27:12.948 --> 06:27:12.958 align:start position:0%
you and you don't actually have to
 
06:27:15.190 --> 06:27:15.200 align:start position:0%
answer this rhetorical but how are how
 
06:27:17.110 --> 06:27:17.120 align:start position:0%
are the delegates selected and how many
 
06:27:19.430 --> 06:27:19.440 align:start position:0%
delegates does each state get uh the
 
06:27:21.868 --> 06:27:21.878 align:start position:0%
answer is it's not defined in Article 5
 
06:27:24.990 --> 06:27:25.000 align:start position:0%
it's determined by Congress Congress
 
06:27:27.030 --> 06:27:27.040 align:start position:0%
determines how the delegates are
 
06:27:29.310 --> 06:27:29.320 align:start position:0%
selected they could simply choose that
 
06:27:31.788 --> 06:27:31.798 align:start position:0%
they themselves are the
 
06:27:33.750 --> 06:27:33.760 align:start position:0%
delegates uh that's well within their
 
06:27:33.760 --> 06:27:34.750 align:start position:0%
delegates uh that's well within their
power

06:27:34.750 --> 06:27:34.760 align:start position:0%
power
 
06:27:36.430 --> 06:27:36.440 align:start position:0%
do you want whoever is currently in
 
06:27:38.590 --> 06:27:38.600 align:start position:0%
office to be the delegate to a
 
06:27:41.030 --> 06:27:41.040 align:start position:0%
constitutional convention just think
 
06:27:43.030 --> 06:27:43.040 align:start position:0%
about it uh question two does it mention
 
06:27:45.350 --> 06:27:45.360 align:start position:0%
anything about an issue specific
 
06:27:47.030 --> 06:27:47.040 align:start position:0%
Constitutional Convention so for
 
06:27:48.430 --> 06:27:48.440 align:start position:0%
instance a constitutional convention
 
06:27:50.548 --> 06:27:50.558 align:start position:0%
about a specific issue for a instance to
 
06:27:51.788 --> 06:27:51.798 align:start position:0%
balanced budget amendment or anything
 
06:27:54.310 --> 06:27:54.320 align:start position:0%
like that the answer is no it does not
 
06:27:56.670 --> 06:27:56.680 align:start position:0%
it there's no such concept it is a
 
06:27:59.628 --> 06:27:59.638 align:start position:0%
fabrication it doesn't exist uh proof
 
06:28:01.390 --> 06:28:01.400 align:start position:0%
towards that is that though the
 
06:28:03.190 --> 06:28:03.200 align:start position:0%
applications themselves can be about a
 
06:28:06.150 --> 06:28:06.160 align:start position:0%
specific subject there is a federal
 
06:28:08.670 --> 06:28:08.680 align:start position:0%
house resolution that is in the works to
 
06:28:10.430 --> 06:28:10.440 align:start position:0%
combine all the Constitutional
 
06:28:12.788 --> 06:28:12.798 align:start position:0%
Convention applications into one this
 
06:28:14.910 --> 06:28:14.920 align:start position:0%
includes obsolete Constitutional
 
06:28:17.670 --> 06:28:17.680 align:start position:0%
Convention applications under Article 5
 
06:28:19.788 --> 06:28:19.798 align:start position:0%
that have absolutely nothing to do with
 
06:28:22.548 --> 06:28:22.558 align:start position:0%
our specific Article 5 convention
 
06:28:24.510 --> 06:28:24.520 align:start position:0%
application all right so what that means
 
06:28:26.510 --> 06:28:26.520 align:start position:0%
is there is an active attempt by
 
06:28:29.070 --> 06:28:29.080 align:start position:0%
Congressman to start an article 5
 
06:28:30.830 --> 06:28:30.840 align:start position:0%
Constitutional Convention this might not
 
06:28:33.430 --> 06:28:33.440 align:start position:0%
have been information you had prior so
 
06:28:34.628 --> 06:28:34.638 align:start position:0%
this is something to consider and it
 
06:28:36.948 --> 06:28:36.958 align:start position:0%
might change your mind on the topic um
 
06:28:38.990 --> 06:28:39.000 align:start position:0%
so question three how can anyone claim
 
06:28:40.070 --> 06:28:40.080 align:start position:0%
that they can be confident about
 
06:28:41.948 --> 06:28:41.958 align:start position:0%
anything that comes out of a convention
 
06:28:43.468 --> 06:28:43.478 align:start position:0%
all right here here's a little thought
 
06:28:46.990 --> 06:28:47.000 align:start position:0%
experiment for you are people wiser Now
 
06:28:50.350 --> 06:28:50.360 align:start position:0%
versus 100 years ago are people wiser
 
06:28:53.910 --> 06:28:53.920 align:start position:0%
Now versus 200 years ago if you think
 
06:28:55.590 --> 06:28:55.600 align:start position:0%
that they're not wiser now than they
 
06:28:57.788 --> 06:28:57.798 align:start position:0%
were back then then you should trust the
 
06:28:59.708 --> 06:28:59.718 align:start position:0%
people who are around throughout the
 
06:29:01.230 --> 06:29:01.240 align:start position:0%
entire history of the United States who
 
06:29:03.628 --> 06:29:03.638 align:start position:0%
all issued an article 5 convention it
 
06:29:05.110 --> 06:29:05.120 align:start position:0%
has never been done it's gotten close
 
06:29:07.390 --> 06:29:07.400 align:start position:0%
and every single time it gets close the
 
06:29:09.548 --> 06:29:09.558 align:start position:0%
resend the the applications keep getting
 
06:29:11.868 --> 06:29:11.878 align:start position:0%
rescinded there's a reason for that all
 
06:29:13.788 --> 06:29:13.798 align:start position:0%
right that now isn't the time to do it
 
06:29:15.750 --> 06:29:15.760 align:start position:0%
the world is way too
 
06:29:17.910 --> 06:29:17.920 align:start position:0%
polarized uh so you might be thinking
 
06:29:20.150 --> 06:29:20.160 align:start position:0%
why don't we just not ratify it if the
 
06:29:21.390 --> 06:29:21.400 align:start position:0%
Constitutional Convention comes out with
 
06:29:23.510 --> 06:29:23.520 align:start position:0%
un bad so if a constitutional convention
 
06:29:25.110 --> 06:29:25.120 align:start position:0%
happens and they come out with a
 
06:29:26.468 --> 06:29:26.478 align:start position:0%
constitution or even just an amendment
 
06:29:28.430 --> 06:29:28.440 align:start position:0%
that's bad why don't we just get not get
 
06:29:29.868 --> 06:29:29.878 align:start position:0%
rid of it you know we can just vote it
 
06:29:32.190 --> 06:29:32.200 align:start position:0%
down well this takes a little bit of
 
06:29:33.310 --> 06:29:33.320 align:start position:0%
History the Articles of the
 
06:29:35.670 --> 06:29:35.680 align:start position:0%
Confederation required unanimous
 
06:29:38.708 --> 06:29:38.718 align:start position:0%
agreement among everybody who was in all
 
06:29:40.670 --> 06:29:40.680 align:start position:0%
the uh various states in the in the
 
06:29:44.150 --> 06:29:44.160 align:start position:0%
states at the time to change anything in
 
06:29:45.788 --> 06:29:45.798 align:start position:0%
the Articles of Confederation so the
 
06:29:48.868 --> 06:29:48.878 align:start position:0%
actual Constitution at the time required
 
06:29:50.750 --> 06:29:50.760 align:start position:0%
unanimous agreement among all the
 
06:29:52.510 --> 06:29:52.520 align:start position:0%
various States before any changes can be
 
06:29:54.948 --> 06:29:54.958 align:start position:0%
made Rhode Island boycotted they said
 
06:29:57.590 --> 06:29:57.600 align:start position:0%
they weren't going to go so what they uh
 
06:29:58.788 --> 06:29:58.798 align:start position:0%
what the other states did was they just
 
06:30:01.190 --> 06:30:01.200 align:start position:0%
independently ratified it and then they
 
06:30:02.868 --> 06:30:02.878 align:start position:0%
just went with the new constitution the
 
06:30:05.270 --> 06:30:05.280 align:start position:0%
current constitution while and then all
 
06:30:06.750 --> 06:30:06.760 align:start position:0%
the other states that didn't ratify it
 
06:30:08.670 --> 06:30:08.680 align:start position:0%
kept the Articles of the Confederation
 
06:30:10.310 --> 06:30:10.320 align:start position:0%
and this forced all those states to sort
 
06:30:12.030 --> 06:30:12.040 align:start position:0%
of adopt the new US
 
06:30:14.110 --> 06:30:14.120 align:start position:0%
Constitution uh if you imagine that sort
 
06:30:15.830 --> 06:30:15.840 align:start position:0%
of thing happening now where we have 50
 
06:30:17.430 --> 06:30:17.440 align:start position:0%
different states imagine 50 different
 
06:30:21.150 --> 06:30:21.160 align:start position:0%
states deciding in various ways that uh
 
06:30:22.230 --> 06:30:22.240 align:start position:0%
we're going to keep the current
 
06:30:23.990 --> 06:30:24.000 align:start position:0%
Constitution and then other ones saying
 
06:30:24.910 --> 06:30:24.920 align:start position:0%
well we're going to take the new
 
06:30:26.788 --> 06:30:26.798 align:start position:0%
constitution it's just not a very good
 
06:30:29.310 --> 06:30:29.320 align:start position:0%
idea it'll just split up the whole Union
 
06:30:29.320 --> 06:30:30.430 align:start position:0%
idea it'll just split up the whole Union
um

06:30:30.430 --> 06:30:30.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:30:33.628 --> 06:30:33.638 align:start position:0%
so wrapping up uh Constitutional
 
06:30:35.310 --> 06:30:35.320 align:start position:0%
Convention is uncontrollable states have
 
06:30:37.910 --> 06:30:37.920 align:start position:0%
no say you the legislatures have no say
 
06:30:39.270 --> 06:30:39.280 align:start position:0%
in what goes on at the Constitutional
 
06:30:41.510 --> 06:30:41.520 align:start position:0%
Convention uh the Supreme Court has
 
06:30:43.350 --> 06:30:43.360 align:start position:0%
absolutely no jurisdiction over a
 
06:30:44.430 --> 06:30:44.440 align:start position:0%
constitutional convention a
 
06:30:46.150 --> 06:30:46.160 align:start position:0%
constitutional convention outranks a
 
06:30:47.468 --> 06:30:47.478 align:start position:0%
supreme court because the Constitutional
 
06:30:50.030 --> 06:30:50.040 align:start position:0%
Convention makes new Supreme Courts they
 
06:30:51.830 --> 06:30:51.840 align:start position:0%
derive their Authority directly from the
 
06:30:53.830 --> 06:30:53.840 align:start position:0%
people they are not bound by the
 
06:30:56.468 --> 06:30:56.478 align:start position:0%
Constitution they make constitutions
 
06:30:58.110 --> 06:30:58.120 align:start position:0%
that's what they do the delegates and
 
06:30:59.468 --> 06:30:59.478 align:start position:0%
lobbyists get to say what will be in the
 
06:31:00.948 --> 06:31:00.958 align:start position:0%
new Constitution and they can use
 
06:31:02.548 --> 06:31:02.558 align:start position:0%
standard political tactics all the ones
 
06:31:04.670 --> 06:31:04.680 align:start position:0%
that we all use uh to decide what will
 
06:31:06.830 --> 06:31:06.840 align:start position:0%
end up in any proposed amendments that
 
06:31:09.510 --> 06:31:09.520 align:start position:0%
are made please support hcr9 to resend
 
06:31:15.708 --> 06:31:15.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:31:15.718 --> 06:31:17.590 align:start position:0%
 
you

06:31:17.590 --> 06:31:17.600 align:start position:0%
you
 
06:31:24.948 --> 06:31:24.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:31:24.958 --> 06:31:29.190 align:start position:0%
 
sideb

06:31:29.190 --> 06:31:29.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:31:33.270 --> 06:31:33.280 align:start position:0%
sorry thank you Mr Speaker today I Rise
 
06:31:34.910 --> 06:31:34.920 align:start position:0%
Against The committee report of an
 
06:31:37.910 --> 06:31:37.920 align:start position:0%
expedient to legislate on hcr9 this
 
06:31:42.548 --> 06:31:42.558 align:start position:0%
resends HCR 40 passed in 2012 12 years
 
06:31:45.830 --> 06:31:45.840 align:start position:0%
ago HCR 40 called for an article 5
 
06:31:49.070 --> 06:31:49.080 align:start position:0%
convention today's hcr9 hearing would
 
06:31:51.270 --> 06:31:51.280 align:start position:0%
cancel that request for an article 5
 
06:31:54.430 --> 06:31:54.440 align:start position:0%
convention I am concerned about both the
 
06:31:57.430 --> 06:31:57.440 align:start position:0%
premise behind the original 2012
 
06:31:59.708 --> 06:31:59.718 align:start position:0%
resolution and the procedural
 
06:32:02.190 --> 06:32:02.200 align:start position:0%
complexities surrounding an article 5
 
06:32:04.590 --> 06:32:04.600 align:start position:0%
convention let me first address the
 
06:32:07.670 --> 06:32:07.680 align:start position:0%
premise I disagree with the notion that
 
06:32:10.990 --> 06:32:11.000 align:start position:0%
a convention should should convene to
 
06:32:14.030 --> 06:32:14.040 align:start position:0%
enact an amendment mandating a balanced
 
06:32:16.868 --> 06:32:16.878 align:start position:0%
federal budget such a mandate poses
 
06:32:18.948 --> 06:32:18.958 align:start position:0%
significant economic risks and could
 
06:32:21.190 --> 06:32:21.200 align:start position:0%
undermine programs like Social Security
 
06:32:24.030 --> 06:32:24.040 align:start position:0%
and Medicare and more impacting millions
 
06:32:26.350 --> 06:32:26.360 align:start position:0%
of Americans and tens and thousands of
 
06:32:29.190 --> 06:32:29.200 align:start position:0%
granite Staters equally concerning are
 
06:32:31.270 --> 06:32:31.280 align:start position:0%
the procedural uncertainties surrounding
 
06:32:33.388 --> 06:32:33.398 align:start position:0%
an article 5 convention some of which
 
06:32:36.670 --> 06:32:36.680 align:start position:0%
you just to must Congress call an
 
06:32:40.270 --> 06:32:40.280 align:start position:0%
article 5 convention in 34 states
 
06:32:43.430 --> 06:32:43.440 align:start position:0%
properly ask for one if called are the
 
06:32:47.070 --> 06:32:47.080 align:start position:0%
limitations on scope binding on the
 
06:32:49.788 --> 06:32:49.798 align:start position:0%
convention what constitutes a valid
 
06:32:52.430 --> 06:32:52.440 align:start position:0%
application to to Congress and who is
 
06:32:55.150 --> 06:32:55.160 align:start position:0%
the judge of that how long are
 
06:32:57.548 --> 06:32:57.558 align:start position:0%
applications valid the list goes on and
 
06:32:59.868 --> 06:32:59.878 align:start position:0%
on with unanswered questions the
 
06:33:01.468 --> 06:33:01.478 align:start position:0%
complexities and uncertainties
 
06:33:03.270 --> 06:33:03.280 align:start position:0%
surrounding an article 5 convention
 
06:33:05.990 --> 06:33:06.000 align:start position:0%
demand thorough Examination for these
 
06:33:08.190 --> 06:33:08.200 align:start position:0%
reasons and more this body should push
 
06:33:10.510 --> 06:33:10.520 align:start position:0%
the red button on an expedient to
 
06:33:13.270 --> 06:33:13.280 align:start position:0%
legislate so another motion can be made
 
06:33:15.788 --> 06:33:15.798 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr
 
06:33:22.070 --> 06:33:22.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:33:26.270 --> 06:33:26.280 align:start position:0%
Manion thank you Mr Speaker hcr9 seeks
 
06:33:28.468 --> 06:33:28.478 align:start position:0%
to resend our active application to an
 
06:33:30.510 --> 06:33:30.520 align:start position:0%
article 5 Convention of States
 
06:33:33.350 --> 06:33:33.360 align:start position:0%
specifically 2012's HCR 40 which was an
 
06:33:35.708 --> 06:33:35.718 align:start position:0%
applic for a balanced budget amendment
 
06:33:37.150 --> 06:33:37.160 align:start position:0%
to the United States
 
06:33:39.230 --> 06:33:39.240 align:start position:0%
Constitution of all the reasons to call
 
06:33:41.350 --> 06:33:41.360 align:start position:0%
a convention the ballooning
 
06:33:45.310 --> 06:33:45.320 align:start position:0%
34.5 trillion debt should remain the top
 
06:33:48.150 --> 06:33:48.160 align:start position:0%
of our list by resending our application
 
06:33:50.430 --> 06:33:50.440 align:start position:0%
we are left begging for the US Congress
 
06:33:52.270 --> 06:33:52.280 align:start position:0%
to take it upon themselves to be
 
06:33:54.750 --> 06:33:54.760 align:start position:0%
fiscally prudent a task they have proven
 
06:33:56.990 --> 06:33:57.000 align:start position:0%
year over-year they cannot perform
 
06:33:59.388 --> 06:33:59.398 align:start position:0%
estimates place the budget increasing by
 
06:34:03.110 --> 06:34:03.120 align:start position:0%
$1 trillion every 100 days the treasury
 
06:34:05.868 --> 06:34:05.878 align:start position:0%
secretary when asked about funding for
 
06:34:08.430 --> 06:34:08.440 align:start position:0%
Middle East conflicts stated we can
 
06:34:11.990 --> 06:34:12.000 align:start position:0%
afford two Wars DC is disconnected from
 
06:34:14.910 --> 06:34:14.920 align:start position:0%
reality the tool provided to us from by
 
06:34:17.270 --> 06:34:17.280 align:start position:0%
the founders is the Article 5 convention
 
06:34:20.468 --> 06:34:20.478 align:start position:0%
process we have co-equal authority with
 
06:34:23.310 --> 06:34:23.320 align:start position:0%
Congress to amend the US Constitution
 
06:34:25.948 --> 06:34:25.958 align:start position:0%
and in manners which the legislative
 
06:34:28.230 --> 06:34:28.240 align:start position:0%
branch is unable or unwilling to make
 
06:34:30.230 --> 06:34:30.240 align:start position:0%
the change it falls to the states to
 
06:34:33.788 --> 06:34:33.798 align:start position:0%
force the change part two article 100 of
 
06:34:35.388 --> 06:34:35.398 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Constitution provides
 
06:34:37.910 --> 06:34:37.920 align:start position:0%
a similar mechanism where every 10 years
 
06:34:39.310 --> 06:34:39.320 align:start position:0%
the people of the granite state are
 
06:34:41.190 --> 06:34:41.200 align:start position:0%
given a ballot question on whether to
 
06:34:43.270 --> 06:34:43.280 align:start position:0%
call a State Convention to amend our
 
06:34:43.280 --> 06:34:44.150 align:start position:0%
call a State Convention to amend our
state

06:34:44.150 --> 06:34:44.160 align:start position:0%
state
 
06:34:46.430 --> 06:34:46.440 align:start position:0%
constitution we have had five such
 
06:34:48.628 --> 06:34:48.638 align:start position:0%
conventions so we are no stranger to

inquiry this right yes thank you Mr
 
06:36:53.708 --> 06:36:53.718 align:start position:0%
chair uh or Mr Speaker sorry if I know a
 
06:36:56.150 --> 06:36:56.160 align:start position:0%
constitutional convention in the days of
 
06:36:59.430 --> 06:36:59.440 align:start position:0%
social media would be a disaster and if
 
06:37:02.628 --> 06:37:02.638 align:start position:0%
I know I actually love the Constitution
 
06:37:05.070 --> 06:37:05.080 align:start position:0%
and that I think changing
 
06:37:08.190 --> 06:37:08.200 align:start position:0%
it through a con uh convention is a
 
06:37:09.910 --> 06:37:09.920 align:start position:0%
dangerous proposition sorry I can't wear
 
06:37:12.150 --> 06:37:12.160 align:start position:0%
my glasses and read at the same time if
 
06:37:14.388 --> 06:37:14.398 align:start position:0%
I know that Congress decides who will be
 
06:37:16.150 --> 06:37:16.160 align:start position:0%
the delegates in a
 
06:37:18.750 --> 06:37:18.760 align:start position:0%
convention if I know that every time
 
06:37:21.388 --> 06:37:21.398 align:start position:0%
America gets close to a con con States
 
06:37:21.398 --> 06:37:22.310 align:start position:0%
America gets close to a con con States
wisely

06:37:22.310 --> 06:37:22.320 align:start position:0%
wisely
 
06:37:27.310 --> 06:37:27.320 align:start position:0%
resend if I know that through HCR 24 in
 
06:37:30.190 --> 06:37:30.200 align:start position:0%
the US Congress uh they're trying to
 
06:37:32.430 --> 06:37:32.440 align:start position:0%
combine all articles of an article 5
 
06:37:35.070 --> 06:37:35.080 align:start position:0%
convention uh thus destroying the idea
 
06:37:36.708 --> 06:37:36.718 align:start position:0%
that a constitutional convention will be
 
06:37:39.430 --> 06:37:39.440 align:start position:0%
a single issue Affair if I know the
 
06:37:41.468 --> 06:37:41.478 align:start position:0%
Constitutional Convention outranks the
 
06:37:44.510 --> 06:37:44.520 align:start position:0%

been proposed to the Constitution by
 
06:38:04.030 --> 06:38:04.040 align:start position:0%
Congress alone and if I know that
 
06:38:05.750 --> 06:38:05.760 align:start position:0%
article 5 of the United States
 
06:38:08.150 --> 06:38:08.160 align:start position:0%
Constitution provides two mechanisms to
 
06:38:10.070 --> 06:38:10.080 align:start position:0%
amend the Constitution one of which is
 
06:38:12.430 --> 06:38:12.440 align:start position:0%
the convention of States process and if
 
06:38:14.788 --> 06:38:14.798 align:start position:0%
I know resending our active application
 
06:38:16.868 --> 06:38:16.878 align:start position:0%

ve thank you Mr Speaker hb1 1244 makes
 
06:45:31.708 --> 06:45:31.718 align:start position:0%
it a violation to smoke or vape in a
 
06:45:33.670 --> 06:45:33.680 align:start position:0%
motor vehicle when a pass under the age
 
06:45:36.070 --> 06:45:36.080 align:start position:0%
of 16 is present we all know that
 
06:45:37.510 --> 06:45:37.520 align:start position:0%
secondhand smoke presents a serious
 
06:45:40.030 --> 06:45:40.040 align:start position:0%
health risk and the risk of secondhand
 
06:45:42.350 --> 06:45:42.360 align:start position:0%
vaping can be just as serious children
 
06:45:43.948 --> 06:45:43.958 align:start position:0%
exposed to secondhand smoke or vaping
 
06:45:46.030 --> 06:45:46.040 align:start position:0%
share the same risks as the smokers
 
06:45:48.830 --> 06:45:48.840 align:start position:0%
themselves including exposure to toxic
 
06:45:50.750 --> 06:45:50.760 align:start position:0%
chemicals respiratory issues
 
06:45:53.590 --> 06:45:53.600 align:start position:0%
cardiovascular problems and cancer these
 
06:45:55.070 --> 06:45:55.080 align:start position:0%
risks can be magnified in children
 
06:45:56.468 --> 06:45:56.478 align:start position:0%
because developing lungs and growing
 
06:45:58.110 --> 06:45:58.120 align:start position:0%
bodies are far more likely to sustain
 
06:46:00.270 --> 06:46:00.280 align:start position:0%
long-term damage potentially leading to
 
06:46:01.910 --> 06:46:01.920 align:start position:0%
lifelong health
 
06:46:01.920 --> 06:46:03.430 align:start position:0%

the member will suspend the member has a
 
06:46:07.628 --> 06:46:07.638 align:start position:0%
right to be
 
06:46:10.388 --> 06:46:10.398 align:start position:0%
heard once again if you need to have a
 
06:46:12.468 --> 06:46:12.478 align:start position:0%
conversation take it out into the Annie
 
06:46:14.910 --> 06:46:14.920 align:start position:0%
room remember may
 
06:46:17.750 --> 06:46:17.760 align:start position:0%
continue thank you smoking has been
 
06:46:20.190 --> 06:46:20.200 align:start position:0%
banned in most indoor spaces for decades
 
06:46:21.510 --> 06:46:21.520 align:start position:0%
because of the wellestablished risk of
 
06:46:22.708 --> 06:46:22.718 align:start position:0%
secondhand smoke and many of the
 
06:46:24.628 --> 06:46:24.638 align:start position:0%
chemicals contained in ecigarettes are
 
06:46:26.468 --> 06:46:26.478 align:start position:0%
known to have serious health risks of
 
06:46:29.150 --> 06:46:29.160 align:start position:0%
their own the effect of secondhand smoke
 
06:46:31.030 --> 06:46:31.040 align:start position:0%
and Vapor in vehicles is Amplified even
 
06:46:33.190 --> 06:46:33.200 align:start position:0%
more because of the confined space even
 
06:46:34.708 --> 06:46:34.718 align:start position:0%
with the windows cracked and ventilation
 
06:46:37.868 --> 06:46:37.878 align:start position:0%
on smoke and Vapor become much more
 
06:46:39.310 --> 06:46:39.320 align:start position:0%
concentrated within a vehicle compared
 
06:46:41.548 --> 06:46:41.558 align:start position:0%
to other indoor spaces making the act of
 
06:46:43.110 --> 06:46:43.120 align:start position:0%
smoking when children are present that
 
06:46:44.468 --> 06:46:44.478 align:start position:0%
much more
 
06:46:47.110 --> 06:46:47.120 align:start position:0%
dangerous young children are often un
 
06:46:48.670 --> 06:46:48.680 align:start position:0%
unable to advocate for themselves in
 
06:46:51.590 --> 06:46:51.600 align:start position:0%
these conditions throughout my life I
 
06:46:53.030 --> 06:46:53.040 align:start position:0%
have dealt with intense migraine
 
06:46:55.150 --> 06:46:55.160 align:start position:0%
headaches one of the triggers for these
 
06:46:58.190 --> 06:46:58.200 align:start position:0%
headaches is tobacco smoke when I was a
 
06:46:59.670 --> 06:46:59.680 align:start position:0%
child my father would reflexively light
 
06:47:01.468 --> 06:47:01.478 align:start position:0%
a cigarette as soon as he got in the car
 
06:47:03.388 --> 06:47:03.398 align:start position:0%
despite my please not to
 
06:47:05.548 --> 06:47:05.558 align:start position:0%
often causing me to have to deal with
 
06:47:07.150 --> 06:47:07.160 align:start position:0%
the pain that would often
 
06:47:09.350 --> 06:47:09.360 align:start position:0%
ensue to try to appease me he would
 
06:47:11.388 --> 06:47:11.398 align:start position:0%
crack the window to try to vent the
 
06:47:13.110 --> 06:47:13.120 align:start position:0%
smoke which tended to Simply push the
 
06:47:14.430 --> 06:47:14.440 align:start position:0%
smoke into the back
 
06:47:16.628 --> 06:47:16.638 align:start position:0%
seat conditions at home weren't weren't
 
06:47:17.948 --> 06:47:17.958 align:start position:0%
much better but at least I could Retreat
 
06:47:20.510 --> 06:47:20.520 align:start position:0%
to my room and Clos the door as a
 
06:47:22.830 --> 06:47:22.840 align:start position:0%
passenger in a car I was
 
06:47:25.110 --> 06:47:25.120 align:start position:0%
trapped we required children under the
 
06:47:26.388 --> 06:47:26.398 align:start position:0%
age of 18 to wear seat belts and
 
06:47:27.788 --> 06:47:27.798 align:start position:0%
vehicles so it should be just as
 
06:47:29.750 --> 06:47:29.760 align:start position:0%
feasible to ban smoking in in vehicles
 
06:47:31.030 --> 06:47:31.040 align:start position:0%
when children are
 
06:47:34.030 --> 06:47:34.040 align:start position:0%
present as a secondary law HP 1244 does
 
06:47:37.310 --> 06:47:37.320 align:start position:0%
not allow police to pull people over
 
06:47:39.868 --> 06:47:39.878 align:start position:0%
just because an occupant is smoking but
 
06:47:41.310 --> 06:47:41.320 align:start position:0%
it sends a message that we understand
 
06:47:43.990 --> 06:47:44.000 align:start position:0%
the dangers involved with smoking in
 
06:47:46.110 --> 06:47:46.120 align:start position:0%
closed spaces when children are present
 
06:47:47.788 --> 06:47:47.798 align:start position:0%
and demonstrates that we truly care for
 
06:47:50.310 --> 06:47:50.320 align:start position:0%
those who cannot stand up for themselves
 
06:47:52.230 --> 06:47:52.240 align:start position:0%
please push the red button to defeat the
 
06:47:54.310 --> 06:47:54.320 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr
 
06:48:09.590 --> 06:48:09.600 align:start position:0%
Speaker I stand in support of the
 
06:48:12.708 --> 06:48:12.718 align:start position:0%
committee report of itl and HB
 
06:48:15.510 --> 06:48:15.520 align:start position:0%
1244 majority was against this bill for
 
06:48:18.868 --> 06:48:18.878 align:start position:0%
two main reasons first the concept of
 
06:48:20.230 --> 06:48:20.240 align:start position:0%
the secondary
 
06:48:23.110 --> 06:48:23.120 align:start position:0%
offense basically you can drive you
 
06:48:25.868 --> 06:48:25.878 align:start position:0%
could drive your vehicle smoke a
 
06:48:27.948 --> 06:48:27.958 align:start position:0%
cigarette with an 8-year-old in your
 
06:48:29.910 --> 06:48:29.920 align:start position:0%
back seat as long as you weren't stopped
 
06:48:33.350 --> 06:48:33.360 align:start position:0%
by by federal authorities so basically
 
06:48:35.468 --> 06:48:35.478 align:start position:0%
the intention of this bill as was stated
 
06:48:39.070 --> 06:48:39.080 align:start position:0%
in testimony was to protect the children
 
06:48:40.910 --> 06:48:40.920 align:start position:0%
but basically how this bill is written
 
06:48:43.270 --> 06:48:43.280 align:start position:0%
it does not do that because as I
 
06:48:46.190 --> 06:48:46.200 align:start position:0%
mentioned you can smoke in the vehicle
 
06:48:48.350 --> 06:48:48.360 align:start position:0%
with someone under 16 as long as you
 
06:48:51.628 --> 06:48:51.638 align:start position:0%
follow the rules of the road you can do
 
06:48:54.830 --> 06:48:54.840 align:start position:0%
it second of all this bill is a slippery
 
06:48:57.788 --> 06:48:57.798 align:start position:0%
slope it's really a civil liberties
 
06:49:00.548 --> 06:49:00.558 align:start position:0%
issue basically the state and the
 
06:49:03.230 --> 06:49:03.240 align:start position:0%
government is saying what you can cannot
 
06:49:07.590 --> 06:49:07.600 align:start position:0%
do in the privacy of your vehicle so I
 
06:49:10.388 --> 06:49:10.398 align:start position:0%
ask what's next is it you can drink
 
06:49:13.708 --> 06:49:13.718 align:start position:0%
coffee in your car not listen to your
 
06:49:16.510 --> 06:49:16.520 align:start position:0%
radio based on these reasons I ask you
 
06:49:18.750 --> 06:49:18.760 align:start position:0%

06:49:21.948 --> 06:49:21.958 align:start position:0%

hand smoke in a confined enclosed space
 
06:51:40.628 --> 06:51:40.638 align:start position:0%

children and

children's bodies are particularly

same with a recommendation the bill
 
06:54:54.150 --> 06:54:54.160 align:start position:0%
ought to pass Senator Thomas walshford
 
06:54:56.750 --> 06:54:56.760 align:start position:0%
majority of the committee minority of
 
06:54:58.230 --> 06:54:58.240 align:start position:0%
the committee having considered the same
 
06:55:00.070 --> 06:55:00.080 align:start position:0%
being unable to agree with the majority

Report with the following resolution
 
06:55:03.990 --> 06:55:04.000 align:start position:0%
resolved it as inexpedient to legislate
 
06:55:05.910 --> 06:55:05.920 align:start position:0%
representative Katherine rmo for the
 
06:55:07.990 --> 06:55:08.000 align:start position:0%
minority of the committee chair

06:55:18.150 --> 06:55:18.160 align:start position:0%
rmo thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker I
 
06:55:19.948 --> 06:55:19.958 align:start position:0%
rise today in opposition to the
 
06:55:23.190 --> 06:55:23.200 align:start position:0%
recommendation of ought to pass for HB
 
06:55:25.590 --> 06:55:25.600 align:start position:0%
1332 this morning I think most of us
 
06:55:27.110 --> 06:55:27.120 align:start position:0%
pulled into the legislative garage
 
06:55:29.548 --> 06:55:29.558 align:start position:0%
entrance on store Street we waved to our
 
06:55:31.590 --> 06:55:31.600 align:start position:0%
patient attendant who did not stop us to
 
06:55:34.230 --> 06:55:34.240 align:start position:0%
ask what type of vehicle we were driving
 
06:55:35.750 --> 06:55:35.760 align:start position:0%
we headed up the ramp to whichever
 
06:55:37.468 --> 06:55:37.478 align:start position:0%
available spot we figured would be
 
06:55:39.708 --> 06:55:39.718 align:start position:0%
easiest to exit the long end of this
 
06:55:43.948 --> 06:55:43.958 align:start position:0%
long day maybe we say good morning to a
 
06:55:46.468 --> 06:55:46.478 align:start position:0%
fellow Committee Member or a district
 
06:55:48.948 --> 06:55:48.958 align:start position:0%
colleague maybe we wave to a legislator
 
06:55:51.030 --> 06:55:51.040 align:start position:0%
from across the aisle as we climbed out
 
06:55:53.830 --> 06:55:53.840 align:start position:0%
of our cars and our trucks large ones
 
06:55:56.270 --> 06:55:56.280 align:start position:0%
small ones electric powered and gas
 
06:55:58.548 --> 06:55:58.558 align:start position:0%
powered and a few Intrepid
 
06:56:00.830 --> 06:56:00.840 align:start position:0%
motorcycles we piled our lunches and our
 
06:56:02.708 --> 06:56:02.718 align:start position:0%
laptops and our coats and our calar into
 
06:56:05.708 --> 06:56:05.718 align:start position:0%
our bags we made our way into rep's Hall
 
06:56:07.590 --> 06:56:07.600 align:start position:0%
where we are trying our best to keep our
 
06:56:09.430 --> 06:56:09.440 align:start position:0%
neighbors safe while still getting
 
06:56:10.990 --> 06:56:11.000 align:start position:0%
government out of the way of people's
 
06:56:16.270 --> 06:56:16.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:56:19.910 --> 06:56:19.920 align:start position:0%
can unfortunately HB 1332 will not make
 
06:56:21.948 --> 06:56:21.958 align:start position:0%
us safer and will instead put government
 
06:56:23.548 --> 06:56:23.558 align:start position:0%
squarely in our way more than any
 
06:56:25.750 --> 06:56:25.760 align:start position:0%
traffic in the store's garage could this
 
06:56:27.990 --> 06:56:28.000 align:start position:0%
bill seeks to prohibit parking electric
 
06:56:29.948 --> 06:56:29.958 align:start position:0%
vehicles in any parking garage in the
 
06:56:32.548 --> 06:56:32.558 align:start position:0%
entire State this ban would not permit
 
06:56:34.310 --> 06:56:34.320 align:start position:0%
individual business owners or
 
06:56:36.430 --> 06:56:36.440 align:start position:0%
municipalities to decide whether to
 
06:56:39.468 --> 06:56:39.478 align:start position:0%
allow a variety of vehicle parking it
 
06:56:41.150 --> 06:56:41.160 align:start position:0%
does not even seek to prohibit charging
 
06:56:43.670 --> 06:56:43.680 align:start position:0%
an EV but simply just parking
 
06:56:46.948 --> 06:56:46.958 align:start position:0%
one out of approximately 12,000 EVS
 
06:56:48.788 --> 06:56:48.798 align:start position:0%
currently in New Hampshire there have
 
06:56:51.070 --> 06:56:51.080 align:start position:0%
been only two car fires neither of which
 
06:56:53.708 --> 06:56:53.718 align:start position:0%
occurred in parking garages for Better
 
06:56:55.910 --> 06:56:55.920 align:start position:0%
or For Worse all vehicles are heavier
 
06:56:57.910 --> 06:56:57.920 align:start position:0%
now than they were in years past not
 
06:57:00.628 --> 06:57:00.638 align:start position:0%
just EVs and banning EVS from parking
 
06:57:02.670 --> 06:57:02.680 align:start position:0%
garages will not significantly impact
 
06:57:05.030 --> 06:57:05.040 align:start position:0%
increased vehicle loads on
 
06:57:07.270 --> 06:57:07.280 align:start position:0%
garages to the extent that there are
 
06:57:09.708 --> 06:57:09.718 align:start position:0%
concerns about vehicle fires in garages
 
06:57:12.468 --> 06:57:12.478 align:start position:0%
they relate to vehicle weights and ages
 
06:57:16.190 --> 06:57:16.200 align:start position:0%
overall flammability of tires garage age
 
06:57:18.270 --> 06:57:18.280 align:start position:0%
and access for firefighters and open air
 
06:57:20.910 --> 06:57:20.920 align:start position:0%
and sprinkler systems in garages the
 
06:57:23.990 --> 06:57:24.000 align:start position:0%
fire rate of electric vehicles is 61
 
06:57:25.830 --> 06:57:25.840 align:start position:0%
times lower than that of gasoline
 
06:57:28.750 --> 06:57:28.760 align:start position:0%
vehicles yet this bill singles out EVS
 
06:57:31.788 --> 06:57:31.798 align:start position:0%
without any real data to support it the
 
06:57:33.590 --> 06:57:33.600 align:start position:0%
only example cited in committee to
 
06:57:35.628 --> 06:57:35.638 align:start position:0%
support this legislation referred to a
 
06:57:37.548 --> 06:57:37.558 align:start position:0%
fire in New York City that resulted in
 
06:57:39.230 --> 06:57:39.240 align:start position:0%
the partial collapse of a parking garage
 
06:57:41.750 --> 06:57:41.760 align:start position:0%
dating from the 1920s the structural
 
06:57:43.190 --> 06:57:43.200 align:start position:0%
issues with that garage have been noted
 
06:57:45.110 --> 06:57:45.120 align:start position:0%
as early as
 
06:57:47.628 --> 06:57:47.638 align:start position:0%
2003 the risks to parking garages are
 
06:57:50.788 --> 06:57:50.798 align:start position:0%
not risks inherent or exclusive to EVS
 
06:57:53.270 --> 06:57:53.280 align:start position:0%
again there are RIS instead risks uh
 
06:57:54.868 --> 06:57:54.878 align:start position:0%
that are more appropriately addressed by
 
06:57:57.430 --> 06:57:57.440 align:start position:0%
garage standards not a state prohibition
 
06:58:00.708 --> 06:58:00.718 align:start position:0%
on local control and privately owned
 
06:58:02.830 --> 06:58:02.840 align:start position:0%
facilities I like pulling into stores
 
06:58:04.270 --> 06:58:04.280 align:start position:0%
garage and seeing all the different cars
 
06:58:06.190 --> 06:58:06.200 align:start position:0%
and trucks sometimes it's fun to guess
 
06:58:07.948 --> 06:58:07.958 align:start position:0%
who might drive which one based on their
 
06:58:09.468 --> 06:58:09.478 align:start position:0%
model and bumper stickers and
 
06:58:12.350 --> 06:58:12.360 align:start position:0%
legislative plates the idea that we as a
 
06:58:14.430 --> 06:58:14.440 align:start position:0%
government body might tell any of us
 
06:58:16.270 --> 06:58:16.280 align:start position:0%
that we can't drive our own vehicle into
 
06:58:18.948 --> 06:58:18.958 align:start position:0%
our own parking garage or someone else's
 
06:58:20.910 --> 06:58:20.920 align:start position:0%
doesn't feel right it doesn't feel like
 
06:58:22.110 --> 06:58:22.120 align:start position:0%
the way we make decisions in New
 
06:58:24.230 --> 06:58:24.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire without data to back it up and
 
06:58:26.110 --> 06:58:26.120 align:start position:0%
we do not have the data here to support
 
06:58:27.750 --> 06:58:27.760 align:start position:0%
more unneeded
 
06:58:30.150 --> 06:58:30.160 align:start position:0%
regulation so to protect our private
 
06:58:32.190 --> 06:58:32.200 align:start position:0%
property rights from State intrusion so
 
06:58:33.510 --> 06:58:33.520 align:start position:0%
that you may continue to rely on the
 
06:58:35.270 --> 06:58:35.280 align:start position:0%
vehicle of your choice and in the
 
06:58:37.230 --> 06:58:37.240 align:start position:0%
absence of demonstrated safety risk to
 
06:58:40.548 --> 06:58:40.558 align:start position:0%
the contrary I ask you to push the red
 
06:58:42.270 --> 06:58:42.280 align:start position:0%
button so that another motion may be
 
06:58:44.388 --> 06:58:44.398 align:start position:0%
made thank you Mr Speaker and I request
 
06:58:46.910 --> 06:58:46.920 align:start position:0%
a division vote CH recognize rson of
 
06:58:46.920 --> 06:58:50.030 align:start position:0%
a division vote CH recognize rson of
Mark

06:58:50.030 --> 06:58:50.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:58:52.310 --> 06:58:52.320 align:start position:0%
pro thank you Mr
 
06:58:55.230 --> 06:58:55.240 align:start position:0%
Speaker fellow Representatives I'm a
 
06:58:56.948 --> 06:58:56.958 align:start position:0%
three minute rule gu so if I stop going
 
06:58:59.628 --> 06:58:59.638 align:start position:0%
over three minutes yell at
 
06:59:04.510 --> 06:59:04.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:59:08.628 --> 06:59:08.638 align:start position:0%
and an F150 Ford gas is
 
06:59:13.430 --> 06:59:13.440 align:start position:0%
4,500 lb an electric one is 7,000 lb
 
06:59:16.510 --> 06:59:16.520 align:start position:0%
plus so yes weight of an electric
 
06:59:19.708 --> 06:59:19.718 align:start position:0%
vehicle is a whole lot more than the
 
06:59:21.750 --> 06:59:21.760 align:start position:0%
heavier gas cars
 
06:59:25.430 --> 06:59:25.440 align:start position:0%
now if they catch fire they burn between
 
06:59:30.948 --> 06:59:30.958 align:start position:0%
2,800 de and 3,000 de a lot hotter than
 
06:59:33.548 --> 06:59:33.558 align:start position:0%
a gas vehicle
 
06:59:36.788 --> 06:59:36.798 align:start position:0%
talked about in a garage yeah there's
 
06:59:39.430 --> 06:59:39.440 align:start position:0%
some holes in there that allow venting
 
06:59:41.990 --> 06:59:42.000 align:start position:0%
but nowhere near what it needs to be
 
06:59:45.110 --> 06:59:45.120 align:start position:0%
when these vehicles off gas they off gas
 
06:59:48.788 --> 06:59:48.798 align:start position:0%
carbon dioxide hydrogen methane organic
 
06:59:52.350 --> 06:59:52.360 align:start position:0%
compounds ethane and other
 
06:59:54.350 --> 06:59:54.360 align:start position:0%
hydrocarbons the batteries have a
 
06:59:55.990 --> 06:59:56.000 align:start position:0%
tendency to
 
06:59:56.000 --> 06:59:57.628 align:start position:0%
tendency to
detonate

06:59:57.628 --> 06:59:57.638 align:start position:0%
detonate
 
07:00:00.670 --> 07:00:00.680 align:start position:0%
explode and if they don't explode they
 
07:00:06.030 --> 07:00:06.040 align:start position:0%
 
07:00:08.788 --> 07:00:08.798 align:start position:0%
we used to take 1,000 gallons Max to put
 
07:00:12.670 --> 07:00:12.680 align:start position:0%
out a car fire now takes 30 to
 
07:00:15.350 --> 07:00:15.360 align:start position:0%
40,000 gallons to put out a car an
 
07:00:18.548 --> 07:00:18.558 align:start position:0%
electric car fire because they tend to
 
07:00:22.830 --> 07:00:22.840 align:start position:0%
keep burning you put them out they light
 
07:00:26.388 --> 07:00:26.398 align:start position:0%
again so trying to get that car out of
 
07:00:29.070 --> 07:00:29.080 align:start position:0%
the garage is going to be an issue as
 
07:00:30.548 --> 07:00:30.558 align:start position:0%
well because it'll probably light back
 
07:00:32.590 --> 07:00:32.600 align:start position:0%
up as we're trying to get it out on the
 
07:00:32.600 --> 07:00:33.830 align:start position:0%
up as we're trying to get it out on the
tow

07:00:33.830 --> 07:00:33.840 align:start position:0%
tow
 
07:00:35.948 --> 07:00:35.958 align:start position:0%
truck they talk
 
07:00:38.948 --> 07:00:38.958 align:start position:0%
about there's only two car electric cars
 
07:00:42.030 --> 07:00:42.040 align:start position:0%
reported burning in the state I know of
 
07:00:45.030 --> 07:00:45.040 align:start position:0%
three offand because the reporting
 
07:00:46.750 --> 07:00:46.760 align:start position:0%
system hasn't caught up to the
 
07:00:50.110 --> 07:00:50.120 align:start position:0%
technology there is no checkbox for an
 
07:00:53.350 --> 07:00:53.360 align:start position:0%
electric vehicle it's just a carfire
 
07:00:55.190 --> 07:00:55.200 align:start position:0%
unless you go and read the narrative
 
07:00:59.230 --> 07:00:59.240 align:start position:0%
that they wrote which is hard to capture
 
07:01:02.628 --> 07:01:02.638 align:start position:0%
just with a search
 
07:01:05.670 --> 07:01:05.680 align:start position:0%
so yes this is about safety it's about
 
07:01:07.910 --> 07:01:07.920 align:start position:0%
firefighter safety it's about public
 
07:01:10.430 --> 07:01:10.440 align:start position:0%
safety and
 
07:01:13.388 --> 07:01:13.398 align:start position:0%
yes would you park a whole bunch of
 
07:01:16.230 --> 07:01:16.240 align:start position:0%
electric cars in our
 
07:01:18.628 --> 07:01:18.638 align:start position:0%
garage I'm pretty sure I wouldn't
 
07:01:20.388 --> 07:01:20.398 align:start position:0%
because that would be the second garage

should or should not manage the risks
 
07:03:44.310 --> 07:03:44.320 align:start position:0%
associated with that when we know that
 
07:03:46.030 --> 07:03:46.040 align:start position:0%
the free market does a pretty good job
 
07:03:47.590 --> 07:03:47.600 align:start position:0%
of doing that between working with their

inquiry thank you Mr
 
07:04:30.230 --> 07:04:30.240 align:start position:0%
Speaker Mr Speaker if I know that the
 
07:04:32.150 --> 07:04:32.160 align:start position:0%
weight of a battery pack in a Hummer
 
07:04:34.590 --> 07:04:34.600 align:start position:0%
electric vehicle weighs more than an
 
07:04:36.270 --> 07:04:36.280 align:start position:0%
entire Chevy
 
07:04:39.310 --> 07:04:39.320 align:start position:0%
sedan and that the increased weight has
 
07:04:41.948 --> 07:04:41.958 align:start position:0%
compromised more than one parking garage
 
07:04:44.150 --> 07:04:44.160 align:start position:0%
but specifically one in New York City
 
07:04:47.388 --> 07:04:47.398 align:start position:0%
leading to the death of one person in
 
07:04:50.468 --> 07:04:50.478 align:start position:0%
injuring five and Mr Speaker if I know
 
07:04:52.750 --> 07:04:52.760 align:start position:0%
because a burning electric vehicle will
 
07:04:55.948 --> 07:04:55.958 align:start position:0%
have to be removed from a parking garage
 
07:04:59.190 --> 07:04:59.200 align:start position:0%
while it's on fire and M and most tow
 
07:05:01.388 --> 07:05:01.398 align:start position:0%
trucks cannot fit into the garages to
 
07:05:04.868 --> 07:05:04.878 align:start position:0%
get them out and finally Mr Speaker if I
 
07:05:07.750 --> 07:05:07.760 align:start position:0%
know that in the 27 years I have been in
 
07:05:10.548 --> 07:05:10.558 align:start position:0%
the fire service little has concerned me
 
07:05:12.910 --> 07:05:12.920 align:start position:0%

inquiry thank you Mr
 
07:09:21.468 --> 07:09:21.478 align:start position:0%
Speaker if I know that we're talking
 
07:09:24.150 --> 07:09:24.160 align:start position:0%
about a procedure that could take only
 
07:09:28.468 --> 07:09:28.478 align:start position:0%
10 minutes to to happen all it is is an
 
07:09:31.788 --> 07:09:31.798 align:start position:0%
OBD2 scanner hooked up to your car and
 
07:09:34.948 --> 07:09:34.958 align:start position:0%
reset your light after it goes out and
 
07:09:36.788 --> 07:09:36.798 align:start position:0%
if I
 
07:09:39.548 --> 07:09:39.558 align:start position:0%
know that this is just extending a grace
 
07:09:43.310 --> 07:09:43.320 align:start position:0%
period from 60 to 120 days but the the
 
07:09:46.830 --> 07:09:46.840 align:start position:0%

one-year
 
07:09:53.670 --> 07:09:53.680 align:start position:0%
exemption and if I know if this passes
 
07:09:56.310 --> 07:09:56.320 align:start position:0%
it will take at least 16 months to get
 
07:09:58.270 --> 07:09:58.280 align:start position:0%
it approved from the
 
07:10:01.628 --> 07:10:01.638 align:start position:0%
EPA and if I know applying to the EP PA
 
07:10:04.948 --> 07:10:04.958 align:start position:0%
for this change can change
 
07:10:08.110 --> 07:10:08.120 align:start position:0%
enforcement requirements including
 
07:10:11.190 --> 07:10:11.200 align:start position:0%
roadside testing and Laser testing which
 
07:10:14.310 --> 07:10:14.320 align:start position:0%
right now we are grandfathered out of
 
07:10:18.350 --> 07:10:18.360 align:start position:0%
with our present situation and lastly if
 
07:10:21.628 --> 07:10:21.638 align:start position:0%
I know that our own Department of
 
07:10:24.670 --> 07:10:24.680 align:start position:0%

07:10:27.868 --> 07:10:27.878 align:start position:0%

Speaker Mr
 
07:13:19.590 --> 07:13:19.600 align:start position:0%
Speaker cacr 15 may be the most fiscally
 
07:13:22.430 --> 07:13:22.440 align:start position:0%
respon irresponsible bill ever to come
 
07:13:24.190 --> 07:13:24.200 align:start position:0%
before this
 
07:13:26.590 --> 07:13:26.600 align:start position:0%
legislature it would take only a third
 
07:13:29.910 --> 07:13:29.920 align:start position:0%
of the legislature to kill any new taxes
 
07:13:32.548 --> 07:13:32.558 align:start position:0%
increased taxes newer increased
 
07:13:35.310 --> 07:13:35.320 align:start position:0%
professional fees and new bonding this
 
07:13:37.788 --> 07:13:37.798 align:start position:0%
is likely to require that the capital
 
07:13:41.110 --> 07:13:41.120 align:start position:0%
budget passed by a 2/3 majority and that
 
07:13:43.670 --> 07:13:43.680 align:start position:0%
no increase for inflation ever again
 
07:13:46.670 --> 07:13:46.680 align:start position:0%
incur in the fees that pay for our many
 
07:13:48.468 --> 07:13:48.478 align:start position:0%
fee based
 
07:13:51.350 --> 07:13:51.360 align:start position:0%
programs if any inflation required
 
07:13:53.628 --> 07:13:53.638 align:start position:0%
increase was proposed in the operating
 
07:13:56.788 --> 07:13:56.798 align:start position:0%
budget for our excise taxes or for a
 
07:14:00.230 --> 07:14:00.240 align:start position:0%
need driven increase in some tax rate
 
07:14:03.388 --> 07:14:03.398 align:start position:0%
the operating would also require 2/3 to
 
07:14:06.350 --> 07:14:06.360 align:start position:0%
pass in both bodies although my
 
07:14:08.990 --> 07:14:09.000 align:start position:0%
colleague for HUD from Hudson says we
 
07:14:12.628 --> 07:14:12.638 align:start position:0%
would all ra rally in emergencies the
 
07:14:14.548 --> 07:14:14.558 align:start position:0%
record in
 
07:14:17.430 --> 07:14:17.440 align:start position:0%
1999 which was our greatest fiscal
 
07:14:21.350 --> 07:14:21.360 align:start position:0%
challenge to date on the establishment
 
07:14:25.468 --> 07:14:25.478 align:start position:0%
of the education trust fund belies this
 
07:14:28.628 --> 07:14:28.638 align:start position:0%
Republicans as they had for 150 years
 
07:14:31.548 --> 07:14:31.558 align:start position:0%
controlled both House and Senate in
 
07:14:33.590 --> 07:14:33.600 align:start position:0%
finance we had cut the cost of
 
07:14:36.070 --> 07:14:36.080 align:start position:0%
inadequate education as much as we could
 
07:14:38.590 --> 07:14:38.600 align:start position:0%
without facing Court challenge but the
 
07:14:42.310 --> 07:14:42.320 align:start position:0%
final cost was equal to 80% of our
 
07:14:46.030 --> 07:14:46.040 align:start position:0%
existing annual budget operating budget
 
07:14:47.868 --> 07:14:47.878 align:start position:0%
think about that we had to raise our
 
07:14:51.070 --> 07:14:51.080 align:start position:0%
revenues 80% in one
 
07:14:54.628 --> 07:14:54.638 align:start position:0%
year HB 117
 
07:14:58.910 --> 07:14:58.920 align:start position:0%
inserted a Statewide property tax at 660
 
07:15:01.830 --> 07:15:01.840 align:start position:0%
per th000 of equalized property value
 
07:15:04.670 --> 07:15:04.680 align:start position:0%
but we still had to raise 2third of the
 
07:15:06.948 --> 07:15:06.958 align:start position:0%
amount from new and increased business
 
07:15:08.590 --> 07:15:08.600 align:start position:0%
and excise
 
07:15:11.548 --> 07:15:11.558 align:start position:0%
taxes did we rally around the flag for
 
07:15:11.558 --> 07:15:12.230 align:start position:0%
taxes did we rally around the flag for
this

07:15:12.230 --> 07:15:12.240 align:start position:0%
this
 
07:15:14.990 --> 07:15:15.000 align:start position:0%
emergency there were 10 roll calls
 
07:15:17.670 --> 07:15:17.680 align:start position:0%
during the three sessions and two months
 
07:15:20.708 --> 07:15:20.718 align:start position:0%
that we fought about this bill the
 
07:15:23.990 --> 07:15:24.000 align:start position:0%
highest yay vote was
 
07:15:27.548 --> 07:15:27.558 align:start position:0%
57% to agree with the final Committee of
 
07:15:30.190 --> 07:15:30.200 align:start position:0%
conference before that the best votes
 
07:15:31.670 --> 07:15:31.680 align:start position:0%
were at
 
07:15:34.590 --> 07:15:34.600 align:start position:0%
53% including one to table the bill
 
07:15:36.708 --> 07:15:36.718 align:start position:0%
after the finance committee version went
 
07:15:40.750 --> 07:15:40.760 align:start position:0%
down to ignominious defeat with
 
07:15:43.708 --> 07:15:43.718 align:start position:0%
45% the new amended bill that became the
 
07:15:48.150 --> 07:15:48.160 align:start position:0%
 
07:15:52.708 --> 07:15:52.718 align:start position:0%
53% how are we ever going to vote by
 
07:15:57.430 --> 07:15:57.440 align:start position:0%
66.7% in future emergencies to vote
 
07:16:00.910 --> 07:16:00.920 align:start position:0%
together under this bill a one-third
 
07:16:03.628 --> 07:16:03.638 align:start position:0%
minority could stop new bonding bonding
 
07:16:06.708 --> 07:16:06.718 align:start position:0%
for reauthorizations of transportation
 
07:16:09.708 --> 07:16:09.718 align:start position:0%
and other Capital items already approved
 
07:16:12.350 --> 07:16:12.360 align:start position:0%
the treasurer's reissue of bonds to
 
07:16:15.868 --> 07:16:15.878 align:start position:0%
achieve lower costs would be seriously
 
07:16:19.270 --> 07:16:19.280 align:start position:0%
impeded and her Department action slowed
 
07:16:21.948 --> 07:16:21.958 align:start position:0%
by the need to submit all Bond payments
 
07:16:26.070 --> 07:16:26.080 align:start position:0%
by a simple 51% majority vote in the
 
07:16:27.628 --> 07:16:27.638 align:start position:0%
House and
 
07:16:31.150 --> 07:16:31.160 align:start position:0%
Senate the bill allows a small minority
 
07:16:33.708 --> 07:16:33.718 align:start position:0%
to stop the issuance of funds for any
 
07:16:37.548 --> 07:16:37.558 align:start position:0%
new professions Li license fees and for
 
07:16:40.708 --> 07:16:40.718 align:start position:0%
the inflation D driven increases needed
 
07:16:44.388 --> 07:16:44.398 align:start position:0%
for existing license fees as no more
 
07:16:47.868 --> 07:16:47.878 align:start position:0%
Federal stimulus money is coming in
 
07:16:50.310 --> 07:16:50.320 align:start position:0%
inflation is still simmering and the
 
07:16:52.910 --> 07:16:52.920 align:start position:0%
revenues are beginning to decline it
 
07:16:55.788 --> 07:16:55.798 align:start position:0%
stops any future Revenue adjustments
 
07:16:58.270 --> 07:16:58.280 align:start position:0%
that would be required to maintain
 
07:17:01.948 --> 07:17:01.958 align:start position:0%
existing services in this state State
 
07:17:04.230 --> 07:17:04.240 align:start position:0%
the small minority could also deny
 
07:17:06.990 --> 07:17:07.000 align:start position:0%
payment for lawsuits against the state
 
07:17:10.230 --> 07:17:10.240 align:start position:0%
both those already won and those pending
 
07:17:12.070 --> 07:17:12.080 align:start position:0%
which trigger would trigger a
 
07:17:12.080 --> 07:17:13.430 align:start position:0%
which trigger would trigger a
constitutional

07:17:13.430 --> 07:17:13.440 align:start position:0%
constitutional
 
07:17:16.670 --> 07:17:16.680 align:start position:0%
crisis ruled by a minority on all
 
07:17:19.388 --> 07:17:19.398 align:start position:0%
matters of money is neither a republic
 
07:17:21.868 --> 07:17:21.878 align:start position:0%

old thank you Mr Speaker the proponents
 
07:17:46.628 --> 07:17:46.638 align:start position:0%
of cic cr15 are profoundly aware of the
 
07:17:48.628 --> 07:17:48.638 align:start position:0%
impact of taxes and
 
07:17:51.750 --> 07:17:51.760 align:start position:0%
fees have on our neighbors we realize
 
07:17:53.310 --> 07:17:53.320 align:start position:0%
that the quality of life in New
 
07:17:56.150 --> 07:17:56.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is directly affected by the
 
07:17:58.670 --> 07:17:58.680 align:start position:0%
disposable income and the ability to
 
07:18:02.230 --> 07:18:02.240 align:start position:0%
enjoy one's life and property proper
 
07:18:05.670 --> 07:18:05.680 align:start position:0%
cacr 15 seeks to give back to the people
 
07:18:09.150 --> 07:18:09.160 align:start position:0%
the power that is inherently theirs that
 
07:18:12.670 --> 07:18:12.680 align:start position:0%
is the power to fund government when
 
07:18:15.948 --> 07:18:15.958 align:start position:0%
this province began Farmers Foresters
 
07:18:18.590 --> 07:18:18.600 align:start position:0%
fishermen Merchants banded together and
 
07:18:20.590 --> 07:18:20.600 align:start position:0%
decided that the
 
07:18:24.030 --> 07:18:24.040 align:start position:0%
public under shared efforts were needed
 
07:18:26.230 --> 07:18:26.240 align:start position:0%
to survive as a matter of fact that's
 
07:18:30.868 --> 07:18:30.878 align:start position:0%
part of our initial oath or motto you
 
07:18:33.948 --> 07:18:33.958 align:start position:0%
can see over on the left there be it a
 
07:18:36.548 --> 07:18:36.558 align:start position:0%
Garrison Farm a stockade Fort or a ship
 
07:18:39.070 --> 07:18:39.080 align:start position:0%
building port or even Mast Road the
 
07:18:43.310 --> 07:18:43.320 align:start position:0%
expense was agreed on and shared by all
 
07:18:47.030 --> 07:18:47.040 align:start position:0%
the decision was not foisted upon all by
 
07:18:50.388 --> 07:18:50.398 align:start position:0%
a minority of one or two as is the
 
07:18:53.548 --> 07:18:53.558 align:start position:0%
current situation rather the majority of
 
07:18:57.590 --> 07:18:57.600 align:start position:0%
the taxpayers worked together somewhere
 
07:18:59.708 --> 07:18:59.718 align:start position:0%
along the path of comedy with the
 
07:19:03.230 --> 07:19:03.240 align:start position:0%
majority the slimmest of majorities
 
07:19:06.270 --> 07:19:06.280 align:start position:0%
began issuing dictate as to how
 
07:19:08.430 --> 07:19:08.440 align:start position:0%
government was going to take both money
 
07:19:11.590 --> 07:19:11.600 align:start position:0%
from our neighbors and who amongst our
 
07:19:14.948 --> 07:19:14.958 align:start position:0%
neighbors was going to benefit from that
 
07:19:18.548 --> 07:19:18.558 align:start position:0%
taking these decisions cannot be made
 
07:19:21.110 --> 07:19:21.120 align:start position:0%
lightly and should not be made on a
 
07:19:23.590 --> 07:19:23.600 align:start position:0%
personal or partisan basis the
 
07:19:25.750 --> 07:19:25.760 align:start position:0%
proponents recognize that taking money
 
07:19:27.910 --> 07:19:27.920 align:start position:0%
from our neighbors is a serious matter
 
07:19:31.030 --> 07:19:31.040 align:start position:0%
deserving serious consideration and in a
 
07:19:32.910 --> 07:19:32.920 align:start position:0%
high degree of agreement as to the
 
07:19:35.310 --> 07:19:35.320 align:start position:0%
purpose and the use of the funds
 
07:19:38.590 --> 07:19:38.600 align:start position:0%
literally taken from our neighbors
 
07:19:42.030 --> 07:19:42.040 align:start position:0%
Pockets because taxation without a large
 
07:19:44.868 --> 07:19:44.878 align:start position:0%
degree of equinity and consensus and
 
07:19:48.030 --> 07:19:48.040 align:start position:0%
collaboration results in bitterness and
 
07:19:50.830 --> 07:19:50.840 align:start position:0%
divisiveness the largest possible
 
07:19:53.310 --> 07:19:53.320 align:start position:0%
majority of those responsible for taking
 
07:19:57.590 --> 07:19:57.600 align:start position:0%
our neighbors wealth must take place for
 
07:20:00.190 --> 07:20:00.200 align:start position:0%
that reason if for none of the many
 
07:20:00.200 --> 07:20:01.548 align:start position:0%
that reason if for none of the many
others

07:20:01.548 --> 07:20:01.558 align:start position:0%
others
 
07:20:05.030 --> 07:20:05.040 align:start position:0%
we being responsible to the people must
 
07:20:08.070 --> 07:20:08.080 align:start position:0%
offer the ability to openly discuss this
 
07:20:12.310 --> 07:20:12.320 align:start position:0%
amendment and let them to decide it into

inquiry thank you Mr
 
07:22:14.670 --> 07:22:14.680 align:start position:0%
Speaker Mr Speaker if I know that the
 
07:22:16.110 --> 07:22:16.120 align:start position:0%
current tax system in New Hampshire
 
07:22:18.150 --> 07:22:18.160 align:start position:0%
gives huge tax breaks to the ultra
 
07:22:20.110 --> 07:22:20.120 align:start position:0%
wealthy and large out ofate
 
07:22:22.350 --> 07:22:22.360 align:start position:0%
corporations while hardworking Granite
 
07:22:24.310 --> 07:22:24.320 align:start position:0%
Staters and our small businesses pick up
 
07:22:26.708 --> 07:22:26.718 align:start position:0%
the tab and if I know that this
 
07:22:28.388 --> 07:22:28.398 align:start position:0%
Constitutional Amendment would make it
 
07:22:30.548 --> 07:22:30.558 align:start position:0%
harder to support those same hard
 
07:22:32.310 --> 07:22:32.320 align:start position:0%
working Granite Staters and small
 
07:22:35.150 --> 07:22:35.160 align:start position:0%
businesses with strong Public Safety
 
07:22:37.388 --> 07:22:37.398 align:start position:0%
great schools and infrastructure that
 
07:22:39.910 --> 07:22:39.920 align:start position:0%
drives our economy forward and if I
 
07:22:41.788 --> 07:22:41.798 align:start position:0%
further know that this Constitutional
 
07:22:44.388 --> 07:22:44.398 align:start position:0%
Amendment would hold hostage important
 
07:22:46.990 --> 07:22:47.000 align:start position:0%
legislative functions such as the leg
 
07:22:48.628 --> 07:22:48.638 align:start position:0%
such as the state budget and
 
07:22:51.190 --> 07:22:51.200 align:start position:0%
transportation bonds to a minority of
 
07:22:53.868 --> 07:22:53.878 align:start position:0%
the legislature resulting in gridlock
 
07:22:56.110 --> 07:22:56.120 align:start position:0%
and finally Mr Speaker if I know that
 
07:22:58.868 --> 07:22:58.878 align:start position:0%
simple majority rule not super majority
 
07:23:01.990 --> 07:23:02.000 align:start position:0%
rule whether you like a policy or not is
 
07:23:03.868 --> 07:23:03.878 align:start position:0%
a fundamental principle of our
 
07:23:06.070 --> 07:23:06.080 align:start position:0%
representative democracy then would I
 
07:23:08.548 --> 07:23:08.558 align:start position:0%
now push the red button thank you Mr
 
07:23:11.308 --> 07:23:11.318 align:start position:0%

07:23:14.030 --> 07:23:14.040 align:start position:0%

inquiry thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker
 
07:23:19.910 --> 07:23:19.920 align:start position:0%
if I know that my constituents are
 
07:23:21.830 --> 07:23:21.840 align:start position:0%
concerned about the high cost of paying
 
07:23:24.830 --> 07:23:24.840 align:start position:0%
a multitude of taxes and fees and they
 
07:23:25.990 --> 07:23:26.000 align:start position:0%
want to keep as much of their
 
07:23:28.750 --> 07:23:28.760 align:start position:0%
hard-earned money as they can and if I
 
07:23:30.590 --> 07:23:30.600 align:start position:0%
know that a super majority rather rather
 
07:23:32.670 --> 07:23:32.680 align:start position:0%
than a simple majority is the best way
 
07:23:34.750 --> 07:23:34.760 align:start position:0%
to limit new and increased taxes and
 
07:23:37.110 --> 07:23:37.120 align:start position:0%
fees then would I press the green button

07:25:28.548 --> 07:25:28.558 align:start position:0%
representative roachford for a
 
07:25:32.308 --> 07:25:32.318 align:start position:0%
 
07:25:35.430 --> 07:25:35.440 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker if I know this bill
 
07:25:37.830 --> 07:25:37.840 align:start position:0%
merely changes a non-aps fund to a
 
07:25:39.750 --> 07:25:39.760 align:start position:0%
lapsing fund and this fund was just
 
07:25:42.750 --> 07:25:42.760 align:start position:0%
established with a bipartisan Voice vote
 
07:25:45.948 --> 07:25:45.958 align:start position:0%
less than a year ago if I know the rules
 
07:25:48.070 --> 07:25:48.080 align:start position:0%
affiliated with this funds program were
 
07:25:49.788 --> 07:25:49.798 align:start position:0%
just adopted in
 
07:25:52.628 --> 07:25:52.638 align:start position:0%
November and if I know that the program
 
07:25:56.030 --> 07:25:56.040 align:start position:0%
just began in Earnest in December and
 
07:25:58.388 --> 07:25:58.398 align:start position:0%
this fund is used for such expenditures
 
07:26:02.270 --> 07:26:02.280 align:start position:0%
as overtime and petrol s and if I know
 
07:26:04.948 --> 07:26:04.958 align:start position:0%
that just yesterday I was speaking to
 
07:26:07.670 --> 07:26:07.680 align:start position:0%
law enforcement in Coos County and they
 
07:26:10.070 --> 07:26:10.080 align:start position:0%
are planning hundreds of patrols using
 
07:26:12.830 --> 07:26:12.840 align:start position:0%
this money for the next couple of
 
07:26:16.190 --> 07:26:16.200 align:start position:0%
months and finally Mr Speaker if I know
 
07:26:19.030 --> 07:26:19.040 align:start position:0%
that it's just too soon to determine if
 
07:26:20.788 --> 07:26:20.798 align:start position:0%
this bill is
 
07:26:24.350 --> 07:26:24.360 align:start position:0%
needed and and an OTP on this is is
 
07:26:27.788 --> 07:26:27.798 align:start position:0%
premature then would I now hit the red
 
07:26:29.910 --> 07:26:29.920 align:start position:0%
button so another motion can be
 
07:26:32.590 --> 07:26:32.600 align:start position:0%
considered Ed J recogniz representative
 
07:26:38.430 --> 07:26:38.440 align:start position:0%
 
07:26:41.990 --> 07:26:42.000 align:start position:0%
inquiry Mr Speaker if I know the
 
07:26:44.628 --> 07:26:44.638 align:start position:0%
Northern Pass Program is a one-time
 
07:26:47.628 --> 07:26:47.638 align:start position:0%
project funded by an appropriation from
 
07:26:51.750 --> 07:26:51.760 align:start position:0%
Surplus made on the last day of the last
 
07:26:55.030 --> 07:26:55.040 align:start position:0%
bium and if I know that in
 
07:26:59.468 --> 07:26:59.478 align:start position:0%
hb2 this fund was designated non-aps
 
07:27:02.868 --> 07:27:02.878 align:start position:0%
because that that is how we move money
 
07:27:06.308 --> 07:27:06.318 align:start position:0%
from Surplus into the next biennium and
 
07:27:10.468 --> 07:27:10.478 align:start position:0%
if I know that regardless of lapsing or
 
07:27:13.830 --> 07:27:13.840 align:start position:0%
non-lps status this project will
 
07:27:17.868 --> 07:27:17.878 align:start position:0%
continue be beyond June 30th
 
07:27:21.510 --> 07:27:21.520 align:start position:0%
2025 only if the new governor and
 
07:27:24.110 --> 07:27:24.120 align:start position:0%
legislature include it in the next
 
07:27:27.830 --> 07:27:27.840 align:start position:0%
budget and finally if I know that
 
07:27:32.868 --> 07:27:32.878 align:start position:0%
lapsing this fund on on June of 2025
 
07:27:36.110 --> 07:27:36.120 align:start position:0%
will make its unspent money available to
 
07:27:39.670 --> 07:27:39.680 align:start position:0%
fund urgent one-time projects for the
 
07:27:42.948 --> 07:27:42.958 align:start position:0%
next bium and we always have plenty of
 
07:27:45.468 --> 07:27:45.478 align:start position:0%
those when we get to the end of the bium
 
07:27:48.590 --> 07:27:48.600 align:start position:0%

inquiry thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker
 
07:31:16.110 --> 07:31:16.120 align:start position:0%
if I know that many communities
 
07:31:18.910 --> 07:31:18.920 align:start position:0%
experience a surge of visitors each day
 
07:31:22.150 --> 07:31:22.160 align:start position:0%
due to various reasons such as tourism
 
07:31:24.948 --> 07:31:24.958 align:start position:0%
retail restaurants sports activities and
 
07:31:27.628 --> 07:31:27.638 align:start position:0%
more and if I know that this bill while
 
07:31:27.638 --> 07:31:28.830 align:start position:0%
more and if I know that this bill while
well-intentioned

07:31:28.830 --> 07:31:28.840 align:start position:0%
well-intentioned
 
07:31:30.830 --> 07:31:30.840 align:start position:0%
primarily helps communities with
 
07:31:33.270 --> 07:31:33.280 align:start position:0%
multiple lodging facilities but does not
 
07:31:36.190 --> 07:31:36.200 align:start position:0%
help those communities adjacent to those
 
07:31:38.070 --> 07:31:38.080 align:start position:0%
communities with lodging facilities and
 
07:31:40.670 --> 07:31:40.680 align:start position:0%
it also fails to help those communities
 
07:31:42.548 --> 07:31:42.558 align:start position:0%
that have many restaurants or retail
 
07:31:44.788 --> 07:31:44.798 align:start position:0%
outlets and thus have increased costs
 
07:31:46.990 --> 07:31:47.000 align:start position:0%
for police and Emergency Services then
 
07:31:49.308 --> 07:31:49.318 align:start position:0%

time and if I know that many such
 
07:44:27.910 --> 07:44:27.920 align:start position:0%
uninspected Vehicles will have been
 
07:44:31.388 --> 07:44:31.398 align:start position:0%
driven as much as 70,000 Mi before the
 
07:44:34.190 --> 07:44:34.200 align:start position:0%
date of the first required
 
07:44:37.270 --> 07:44:37.280 align:start position:0%
inspection and if I know that tires
 
07:44:40.830 --> 07:44:40.840 align:start position:0%
brakes steering mechanisms and exhaust
 
07:44:44.230 --> 07:44:44.240 align:start position:0%
control devices may all fail during this
 
07:44:47.708 --> 07:44:47.718 align:start position:0%
extended period of pre-inspection time
 
07:44:50.468 --> 07:44:50.478 align:start position:0%
but that that but that this bill
 
07:44:54.430 --> 07:44:54.440 align:start position:0%
includes no fee supported system nor
 
07:44:57.110 --> 07:44:57.120 align:start position:0%
fiscal analysis of measures that would
 
07:44:59.910 --> 07:44:59.920 align:start position:0%
at least provide for placement on these
 
07:45:03.070 --> 07:45:03.080 align:start position:0%
vehicles of stickers to enable and pay
 
07:45:05.628 --> 07:45:05.638 align:start position:0%
for identification by Public Safety
 
07:45:08.590 --> 07:45:08.600 align:start position:0%
officials of the pre-inspection status
 
07:45:11.430 --> 07:45:11.440 align:start position:0%
and potential public safety issues
 
07:45:13.628 --> 07:45:13.638 align:start position:0%
presented by these
 
07:45:16.510 --> 07:45:16.520 align:start position:0%
vehicles and if I know that data reports
 
07:45:18.708 --> 07:45:18.718 align:start position:0%
showing low levels of new vehicle
 
07:45:22.190 --> 07:45:22.200 align:start position:0%
current law inspection failures are
 
07:45:25.270 --> 07:45:25.280 align:start position:0%
misleading because life safety issues
 
07:45:27.990 --> 07:45:28.000 align:start position:0%
discovered during inspection are often
 
07:45:30.868 --> 07:45:30.878 align:start position:0%
corrected prior to completion of the
 
07:45:34.990 --> 07:45:35.000 align:start position:0%
inspection process knowing all of this
 
07:45:37.990 --> 07:45:38.000 align:start position:0%
wouldn't I now press the red button to
 
07:45:41.230 --> 07:45:41.240 align:start position:0%

07:45:55.388 --> 07:45:55.398 align:start position:0%
Speaker Mr Speaker if I know that
 
07:45:57.308 --> 07:45:57.318 align:start position:0%
deferring inspection of vehicles
 
07:45:59.830 --> 07:45:59.840 align:start position:0%
purchased new in the model year or
 
07:46:02.548 --> 07:46:02.558 align:start position:0%
before until the second year after
 
07:46:05.468 --> 07:46:05.478 align:start position:0%
purchase would reduce annual inspections
 
07:46:07.350 --> 07:46:07.360 align:start position:0%
by approximately
 
07:46:11.750 --> 07:46:11.760 align:start position:0%
83,000 and save owners over $3.3 million
 
07:46:14.788 --> 07:46:14.798 align:start position:0%
per year plus their time and their
 
07:46:17.510 --> 07:46:17.520 align:start position:0%
effort and if I know that passing this
 
07:46:20.590 --> 07:46:20.600 align:start position:0%
bill would not substantially compromise
 
07:46:24.150 --> 07:46:24.160 align:start position:0%
Public Safety given that just onethird
 
07:46:27.190 --> 07:46:27.200 align:start position:0%

minor issues classified as vehicle info
 
07:46:40.590 --> 07:46:40.600 align:start position:0%
glass or tires and if I know further
 
07:46:42.830 --> 07:46:42.840 align:start position:0%
that we do not charge inspection fees
 
07:46:44.510 --> 07:46:44.520 align:start position:0%
for the purpose of generating state
 
07:46:47.510 --> 07:46:47.520 align:start position:0%
revenue and that this bill would have no
 
07:46:50.388 --> 07:46:50.398 align:start position:0%
material fiscal impact on the state with
 
07:46:52.750 --> 07:46:52.760 align:start position:0%

with the everchanging vicisitudes
 
07:50:10.670 --> 07:50:10.680 align:start position:0%
of can you not hear
 
07:50:14.670 --> 07:50:14.680 align:start position:0%
it oh if I know sorry that this state
 
07:50:16.670 --> 07:50:16.680 align:start position:0%
has never kept up with the everchanging
 
07:50:20.110 --> 07:50:20.120 align:start position:0%
vicissitudes of the congress's federal
 
07:50:24.270 --> 07:50:24.280 align:start position:0%
expense deduction in
 
07:50:27.468 --> 07:50:27.478 align:start position:0%
2011 uh we were arguing about whether to
 
07:50:30.110 --> 07:50:30.120 align:start position:0%
follow them up to to
 
07:50:37.990 --> 07:50:38.000 align:start position:0%
$100 and someone and if oh yes okay
 
07:50:38.000 --> 07:50:39.548 align:start position:0%
$100 and someone and if oh yes okay
um

07:50:39.548 --> 07:50:39.558 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:50:45.510 --> 07:50:45.520 align:start position:0%
yes if I know that we have never kept up
 
07:50:48.788 --> 07:50:48.798 align:start position:0%
with the federal exemption but that the
 
07:50:51.230 --> 07:50:51.240 align:start position:0%
federal exemption sometimes goes up and
 
07:50:53.868 --> 07:50:53.878 align:start position:0%
sometimes goes down
 
07:50:58.110 --> 07:50:58.120 align:start position:0%
um and that in 2025 and Beyond the
 
07:51:00.270 --> 07:51:00.280 align:start position:0%
member remember must be in their seat
 
07:51:03.468 --> 07:51:03.478 align:start position:0%
and if I know that forgoing more Revenue
 
07:51:06.868 --> 07:51:06.878 align:start position:0%
than we will need next year and Beyond
 
07:51:09.388 --> 07:51:09.398 align:start position:0%
may be harmful to our younger
 
07:51:12.150 --> 07:51:12.160 align:start position:0%
generations and others in need of
 
07:51:14.190 --> 07:51:14.200 align:start position:0%
Greater educational mental health and
 
07:51:17.190 --> 07:51:17.200 align:start position:0%
job supports than we will be able to
 
07:51:20.308 --> 07:51:20.318 align:start position:0%
afford uh and that this
 
07:51:24.750 --> 07:51:24.760 align:start position:0%
makes a and if I know that this will
 
07:51:29.350 --> 07:51:29.360 align:start position:0%
cost us money on would I
 
07:51:34.708 --> 07:51:34.718 align:start position:0%
vote no red thank you chair recognizes
 
07:51:38.468 --> 07:51:38.478 align:start position:0%
 
07:51:41.990 --> 07:51:42.000 align:start position:0%
in thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker if I
 
07:51:44.830 --> 07:51:44.840 align:start position:0%
know that this bill allows for assets
 
07:51:48.230 --> 07:51:48.240 align:start position:0%
put in service as of January 1st 2025 to
 
07:51:50.510 --> 07:51:50.520 align:start position:0%
be expensed up to 1 million from the
 
07:51:53.510 --> 07:51:53.520 align:start position:0%
current limit of 500,000 and if I know
 
07:51:55.670 --> 07:51:55.680 align:start position:0%
that this 1 million amount is more in
 
07:51:59.030 --> 07:51:59.040 align:start position:0%
line with current IRS limits
 
07:52:00.830 --> 07:52:00.840 align:start position:0%
and if I further know that this helps
 
07:52:03.030 --> 07:52:03.040 align:start position:0%
stimulate businesses to invest and stay
 
07:52:05.350 --> 07:52:05.360 align:start position:0%
