00:03:35.089 --> 00:03:35.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:38.280 align:start position:0%
I have a few extra copies right here
 
00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:40.860 align:start position:0%
in case
 
00:03:42.589 --> 00:03:42.599 align:start position:0%
anybody in the public may want to see
 
00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:43.850 align:start position:0%
anybody in the public may want to see
that

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:43.860 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:49.610 align:start position:0%
that
um

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:54.120 align:start position:0%
looking at that amended version
 
00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:57.360 align:start position:0%
um there there's terminology which has
 
00:03:59.570 --> 00:03:59.580 align:start position:0%
been struck
 
00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:00.830 align:start position:0%
been struck
um

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:04:05.149 --> 00:04:05.159 align:start position:0%
in the Senate version you have uh is a
 
00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:07.860 align:start position:0%
public school designated as this as the
 
00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:09.900 align:start position:0%
anchor School
 
00:04:13.729 --> 00:04:13.739 align:start position:0%
uh this version right here is is a
 
00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:17.180 align:start position:0%
public school or public Academy
 
00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:21.120 align:start position:0%
complying with the provisions of 194 23e
 
00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:23.280 align:start position:0%
that does not require additional tuition
 
00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:28.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:31.670 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:31.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:34.969 --> 00:04:34.979 align:start position:0%
the the question that I I've heard is
 
00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:38.520 align:start position:0%
that this this hones us in a little bit
 
00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:40.740 align:start position:0%
closer to the situations which we have
 
00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:42.300 align:start position:0%
out there we have these schools which
 
00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:45.540 align:start position:0%
are k4s k3s K through eights which don't
 
00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:47.340 align:start position:0%
have the receiving
 
00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:49.740 align:start position:0%
District levels for beyond what they
 
00:04:51.469 --> 00:04:51.479 align:start position:0%
offer in their own community so their
 
00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:53.820 align:start position:0%
tuition out there's a number of
 
00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:55.500 align:start position:0%
districts which do this throughout the
 
00:04:57.530 --> 00:04:57.540 align:start position:0%
state a large number do what they have
 
00:04:59.629 --> 00:04:59.639 align:start position:0%
to do it and there are a number of
 
00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:01.560 align:start position:0%
agreements and contracts which are
 
00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:04.380 align:start position:0%
developed between the the sending
 
00:05:06.409 --> 00:05:06.419 align:start position:0%
district and the receiving districts for
 
00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:08.880 align:start position:0%
how the tuition payment all is going to
 
00:05:10.909 --> 00:05:10.919 align:start position:0%
be paid for
 
00:05:10.919 --> 00:05:11.930 align:start position:0%
be paid for
um

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:11.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:05:15.409 --> 00:05:15.419 align:start position:0%
the situation I I reflected on and I've
 
00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:17.880 align:start position:0%
talked with is the situation in my
 
00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:19.860 align:start position:0%
district I have two of them land aft and
 
00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:21.900 align:start position:0%
Piermont both tuition out one's a k
 
00:05:23.629 --> 00:05:23.639 align:start position:0%
through three one's a k through k
 
00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:25.320 align:start position:0%
through eight
 
00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:28.380 align:start position:0%
and the K through 8 does tuition their
 
00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:31.560 align:start position:0%
kids to Thetford Academy and Vermont to
 
00:05:34.029 --> 00:05:34.039 align:start position:0%
uh River
 
00:05:36.409 --> 00:05:36.419 align:start position:0%
Oxbow High School which is over in
 
00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:38.460 align:start position:0%
Bradford Vermont which is a regular
 
00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:39.900 align:start position:0%
public high school in the state of
 
00:05:43.129 --> 00:05:43.139 align:start position:0%
Vermont St Johnsbury Academy which is a
 
00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:45.120 align:start position:0%
school much like Pinkerton Academy here
 
00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:47.820 align:start position:0%
in in New Hampshire the tuition out the
 
00:05:50.629 --> 00:05:50.639 align:start position:0%
Rivendell which is a Interstate School
 
00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:53.460 align:start position:0%
District between Orford Vermont and New
 
00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:56.220 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and and fairly Vermont and
 
00:05:58.070 --> 00:05:58.080 align:start position:0%
also the Woodsville High School
 
00:06:01.909 --> 00:06:01.919 align:start position:0%
the situation is that the district has
 
00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:03.960 align:start position:0%
set a cap of nineteen thousand dollars
 
00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:05.340 align:start position:0%
is what they're going to pay for
 
00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:06.840 align:start position:0%
tuitioning their students but they have
 
00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:08.400 align:start position:0%
students already attending these various
 
00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:09.770 align:start position:0%
students already attending these various
schools

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:09.780 align:start position:0%
schools
 
00:06:14.689 --> 00:06:14.699 align:start position:0%
and the school at one of those this one
 
00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:17.220 align:start position:0%
of those receiving schools has now which
 
00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:20.160 align:start position:0%
they're all approved schools has upped
 
00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:22.560 align:start position:0%
their cat up their tuition beyond the
 
00:06:24.409 --> 00:06:24.419 align:start position:0%
cap but students are already attending
 
00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:27.180 align:start position:0%
that within families that school and
 
00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:29.460 align:start position:0%
other students in that in those families
 
00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:31.800 align:start position:0%
are not there yet they want to go and
 
00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:34.560 align:start position:0%
have the same Transportation all so they
 
00:06:37.309 --> 00:06:37.319 align:start position:0%
they with the cap they can't
 
00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:40.020 align:start position:0%
and so the difference here is well can I
 
00:06:42.529 --> 00:06:42.539 align:start position:0%
as a parent pay that difference or can
 
00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:45.000 align:start position:0%
the district pay it I think the the
 
00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:46.380 align:start position:0%
legislation that we have in front of us
 
00:06:50.409 --> 00:06:50.419 align:start position:0%
allows that to occur the issue becomes
 
00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:53.580 align:start position:0%
this uh we're putting in public school
 
00:06:57.050 --> 00:06:57.060 align:start position:0%
or public Academy those are high schools
 
00:06:57.060 --> 00:06:58.189 align:start position:0%
or public Academy those are high schools
only

00:06:58.189 --> 00:06:58.199 align:start position:0%
only
 
00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:00.840 align:start position:0%
and we do have some K through threes and
 
00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:03.840 align:start position:0%
K through four switch tuition out so the
 
00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:08.880 align:start position:0%
reference to 193 9 194 23e or even
 
00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:10.800 align:start position:0%
without even putting a reference of a
 
00:07:13.189 --> 00:07:13.199 align:start position:0%
statutory reference it Deals Only what
 
00:07:18.409 --> 00:07:18.419 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:18.419 --> 00:07:20.870 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:20.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:24.060 align:start position:0%
if that if that Amendment were to try to
 
00:07:25.490 --> 00:07:25.500 align:start position:0%
deal with this and this is different
 
00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:28.560 align:start position:0%
than manifest education hardship and
 
00:07:30.469 --> 00:07:30.479 align:start position:0%
best interest to the student that that
 
00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:32.280 align:start position:0%
sectional law this is not a manifest
 
00:07:34.189 --> 00:07:34.199 align:start position:0%
education Archer this is not in the best
 
00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:37.280 align:start position:0%
interest this is a contracted service to
 
00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:40.560 align:start position:0%
provide what that child is guaranteed by
 
00:07:42.710 --> 00:07:42.720 align:start position:0%
our statutes to receive that adequate
 
00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:45.360 align:start position:0%
opportunity for an adequate education
 
00:07:48.650 --> 00:07:48.660 align:start position:0%
so it's a actually it's it's it's a
 
00:07:52.010 --> 00:07:52.020 align:start position:0%
different section of law
 
00:07:54.710 --> 00:07:54.720 align:start position:0%
now where do we go and how we how do we
 
00:07:58.430 --> 00:07:58.440 align:start position:0%
help try to support these schools which
 
00:08:00.950 --> 00:08:00.960 align:start position:0%
are trying to contract with to get these
 
00:08:03.710 --> 00:08:03.720 align:start position:0%
kids the education they need there was
 
00:08:06.230 --> 00:08:06.240 align:start position:0%
an estab in this in this amendment right
 
00:08:09.890 --> 00:08:09.900 align:start position:0%
here to do that this would do it for
 
00:08:12.170 --> 00:08:12.180 align:start position:0%
grades 9 through 12.
 
00:08:14.930 --> 00:08:14.940 align:start position:0%
it wouldn't do it for any Elementary or
 
00:08:18.529 --> 00:08:18.539 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:21.770 --> 00:08:21.780 align:start position:0%
perhaps the center length so what 194
 
00:08:23.809 --> 00:08:23.819 align:start position:0%
23e without having a copy of it in front
 
00:08:25.790 --> 00:08:25.800 align:start position:0%
of me that's just high schools is that a
 
00:08:28.189 --> 00:08:28.199 align:start position:0%
provision of Justice January in here it
 
00:08:31.010 --> 00:08:31.020 align:start position:0%
says that's just high scores yeah you
 
00:08:32.750 --> 00:08:32.760 align:start position:0%
can look it up and think okay that's an
 
00:08:34.430 --> 00:08:34.440 align:start position:0%
older one but if that part of Statute
 
00:08:36.409 --> 00:08:36.419 align:start position:0%
hasn't changed
 
00:08:40.389 --> 00:08:40.399 align:start position:0%
um that that section of 194 21
 
00:08:43.790 --> 00:08:43.800 align:start position:0%
22 23 references
 
00:08:45.230 --> 00:08:45.240 align:start position:0%
high schools
 
00:08:46.790 --> 00:08:46.800 align:start position:0%
because the references back to high
 
00:08:48.769 --> 00:08:48.779 align:start position:0%
school but also says they must comply
 
00:08:51.829 --> 00:08:51.839 align:start position:0%
and you know with the approval standards
 
00:08:54.470 --> 00:08:54.480 align:start position:0%
of what a high school is so it I think
 
00:08:56.389 --> 00:08:56.399 align:start position:0%
it makes sure that everybody receives
 
00:08:58.130 --> 00:08:58.140 align:start position:0%
that opportunity to receive all those
 
00:09:02.329 --> 00:09:02.339 align:start position:0%
Services if you go farther in 194 uh up
 
00:09:05.810 --> 00:09:05.820 align:start position:0%
to 194 colon 27 I think then you start
 
00:09:08.329 --> 00:09:08.339 align:start position:0%
getting into some other
 
00:09:08.339 --> 00:09:09.170 align:start position:0%
getting into some other
um

00:09:09.170 --> 00:09:09.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:11.990 --> 00:09:12.000 align:start position:0%
areas which may include the the
 
00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.350 align:start position:0%
areas which may include the the
elementary

00:09:15.350 --> 00:09:15.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:16.730 --> 00:09:16.740 align:start position:0%
so I guess the question is why are we
 
00:09:18.590 --> 00:09:18.600 align:start position:0%
limiting it why wouldn't we just say
 
00:09:20.630 --> 00:09:20.640 align:start position:0%
that at least one option is a public
 
00:09:22.850 --> 00:09:22.860 align:start position:0%
school or public Academy that does not
 
00:09:25.009 --> 00:09:25.019 align:start position:0%
require additional just strike complying
 
00:09:27.350 --> 00:09:27.360 align:start position:0%
with the provisions of RSA and that
 
00:09:30.290 --> 00:09:30.300 align:start position:0%
would allow grades K through 12 public
 
00:09:35.810 --> 00:09:35.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:39.230 --> 00:09:39.240 align:start position:0%
so taking all stature reference out well
 
00:09:41.750 --> 00:09:41.760 align:start position:0%
again if you strike the words from
 
00:09:43.970 --> 00:09:43.980 align:start position:0%
complying all the way to the RSA right
 
00:09:45.949 --> 00:09:45.959 align:start position:0%
it just says that it would be at least
 
00:09:47.630 --> 00:09:47.640 align:start position:0%
one option as a public school or a
 
00:09:49.130 --> 00:09:49.140 align:start position:0%
public Academy that does not require
 
00:09:50.990 --> 00:09:51.000 align:start position:0%
additional tuition payments from parents
 
00:09:53.150 --> 00:09:53.160 align:start position:0%
and that we're not limiting it just to
 
00:09:54.590 --> 00:09:54.600 align:start position:0%
high school we're limiting it to any
 
00:09:56.630 --> 00:09:56.640 align:start position:0%
school where where a district may have
 
00:09:59.329 --> 00:09:59.339 align:start position:0%
to contract out for whatever reason
 
00:10:01.490 --> 00:10:01.500 align:start position:0%
um a child where there's no again if you
 
00:10:04.130 --> 00:10:04.140 align:start position:0%
read the beginning portion of this this
 
00:10:06.410 --> 00:10:06.420 align:start position:0%
bill that says where there's no public
 
00:10:09.290 --> 00:10:09.300 align:start position:0%
school for a child's grade it does in a
 
00:10:12.949 --> 00:10:12.959 align:start position:0%
resident District so I'm thinking of
 
00:10:15.290 --> 00:10:15.300 align:start position:0%
um Hill this is a great example right so
 
00:10:16.370 --> 00:10:16.380 align:start position:0%
the town of Hill has an elementary
 
00:10:18.590 --> 00:10:18.600 align:start position:0%
school K through K through five but it
 
00:10:20.030 --> 00:10:20.040 align:start position:0%
stops at five
 
00:10:22.190 --> 00:10:22.200 align:start position:0%
and then they tuition out their kids to
 
00:10:24.769 --> 00:10:24.779 align:start position:0%
other schools for Franklin or Newfound
 
00:10:28.430 --> 00:10:28.440 align:start position:0%
for the for the I got that yeah so if we
 
00:10:30.290 --> 00:10:30.300 align:start position:0%
didn't if we don't put that statutory
 
00:10:32.150 --> 00:10:32.160 align:start position:0%
reference we just say that it would
 
00:10:34.070 --> 00:10:34.080 align:start position:0%
allow them to create multiple contracts
 
00:10:35.750 --> 00:10:35.760 align:start position:0%
in multiple schools and if one happens
 
00:10:38.150 --> 00:10:38.160 align:start position:0%
to be more than base tuition it would
 
00:10:39.710 --> 00:10:39.720 align:start position:0%
allow parents if they wanted to choose
 
00:10:42.350 --> 00:10:42.360 align:start position:0%
it to pay the difference see the the
 
00:10:44.389 --> 00:10:44.399 align:start position:0%
reason why I added the statutory
 
00:10:49.009 --> 00:10:49.019 align:start position:0%
language into that is that Romans 6
 
00:10:51.949 --> 00:10:51.959 align:start position:0%
is within the statute section of law
 
00:10:54.590 --> 00:10:54.600 align:start position:0%
which deals with manifest education
 
00:10:57.170 --> 00:10:57.180 align:start position:0%
so as Romans 6 referencing manifests
 
00:10:57.180 --> 00:10:58.370 align:start position:0%
so as Romans 6 referencing manifests
education

00:10:58.370 --> 00:10:58.380 align:start position:0%
education
 
00:11:01.190 --> 00:11:01.200 align:start position:0%
best interest is also there first you
 
00:11:02.690 --> 00:11:02.700 align:start position:0%
know and I used to do that as a
 
00:11:04.610 --> 00:11:04.620 align:start position:0%
principal when in the best interest of
 
00:11:07.329 --> 00:11:07.339 align:start position:0%
student I sometimes moved one's kid from
 
00:11:11.870 --> 00:11:11.880 align:start position:0%
uh Mr Tim's class to Mrs Ruth's class
 
00:11:14.389 --> 00:11:14.399 align:start position:0%
across the hallway where learning
 
00:11:15.530 --> 00:11:15.540 align:start position:0%
teaching styles were a little bit
 
00:11:18.470 --> 00:11:18.480 align:start position:0%
different or there was not the the issue
 
00:11:19.670 --> 00:11:19.680 align:start position:0%
that was occurring in the first
 
00:11:21.710 --> 00:11:21.720 align:start position:0%
classroom that's the best interest by
 
00:11:24.050 --> 00:11:24.060 align:start position:0%
the Manifest educational hardship is the
 
00:11:27.050 --> 00:11:27.060 align:start position:0%
next step which you go into the realm of
 
00:11:30.949 --> 00:11:30.959 align:start position:0%
dealing with the board and and you you
 
00:11:34.190 --> 00:11:34.200 align:start position:0%
you have to have that particular
 
00:11:36.050 --> 00:11:36.060 align:start position:0%
criteria which we have is something
 
00:11:38.509 --> 00:11:38.519 align:start position:0%
that's severe and significant
 
00:11:40.970 --> 00:11:40.980 align:start position:0%
an issue of some kind that's where this
 
00:11:43.269 --> 00:11:43.279 align:start position:0%
is within and I was just wondering if if
 
00:11:47.690 --> 00:11:47.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:50.449 --> 00:11:50.459 align:start position:0%
would be only referencing manifest best
 
00:11:53.569 --> 00:11:53.579 align:start position:0%
interest or would it be referencing that
 
00:11:55.550 --> 00:11:55.560 align:start position:0%
the contract that you have to do for a
 
00:11:59.870 --> 00:11:59.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:08.269 --> 00:12:08.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:10.550 --> 00:12:10.560 align:start position:0%
represent my own yeah and I I also I
 
00:12:13.490 --> 00:12:13.500 align:start position:0%
also have a concern about uh that may
 
00:12:15.050 --> 00:12:15.060 align:start position:0%
require parents to pay additional
 
00:12:17.630 --> 00:12:17.640 align:start position:0%
tuition I mean the issue here is you
 
00:12:19.490 --> 00:12:19.500 align:start position:0%
have a public school
 
00:12:21.710 --> 00:12:21.720 align:start position:0%
and that uh
 
00:12:23.329 --> 00:12:23.339 align:start position:0%
kids should be able to go to school
 
00:12:25.790 --> 00:12:25.800 align:start position:0%
without they're already paying for it
 
00:12:27.949 --> 00:12:27.959 align:start position:0%
through taxes Etc so why should parents
 
00:12:29.630 --> 00:12:29.640 align:start position:0%
then have to pay additional seem to me
 
00:12:32.930 --> 00:12:32.940 align:start position:0%
that if a school district identifies a
 
00:12:34.790 --> 00:12:34.800 align:start position:0%
particular School District
 
00:12:36.949 --> 00:12:36.959 align:start position:0%
then they ought to be they ought to pay
 
00:12:38.750 --> 00:12:38.760 align:start position:0%
for that and the parents shouldn't have
 
00:12:41.630 --> 00:12:41.640 align:start position:0%
to be have to pay a portion of it and
 
00:12:45.290 --> 00:12:45.300 align:start position:0%
that's the concern that I have with this
 
00:12:47.870 --> 00:12:47.880 align:start position:0%
but that that argument could be rebuffed
 
00:12:50.990 --> 00:12:51.000 align:start position:0%
in a community too by saying that we we
 
00:12:52.730 --> 00:12:52.740 align:start position:0%
were sending our kids to that school
 
00:12:55.970 --> 00:12:55.980 align:start position:0%
when the tuition Camp was 19 000 the
 
00:12:58.610 --> 00:12:58.620 align:start position:0%
school now has since up that Annie
 
00:13:01.790 --> 00:13:01.800 align:start position:0%
and so when Johnny is now going to be a
 
00:13:04.069 --> 00:13:04.079 align:start position:0%
junior the next year he's going to have
 
00:13:05.389 --> 00:13:05.399 align:start position:0%
to pay you're going to have to pay that
 
00:13:07.850 --> 00:13:07.860 align:start position:0%
difference should what happens if they
 
00:13:09.350 --> 00:13:09.360 align:start position:0%
say no we're not going to pay above our
 
00:13:11.810 --> 00:13:11.820 align:start position:0%
calf so if that student now have to pick
 
00:13:14.090 --> 00:13:14.100 align:start position:0%
another school and move to another
 
00:13:15.769 --> 00:13:15.779 align:start position:0%
learning environment in a high school
 
00:13:17.389 --> 00:13:17.399 align:start position:0%
well it seem to be that in the contract
 
00:13:19.210 --> 00:13:19.220 align:start position:0%
there'll be some kind of a grandfather
 
00:13:22.129 --> 00:13:22.139 align:start position:0%
for that particular individual that
 
00:13:23.750 --> 00:13:23.760 align:start position:0%
particular family that's involved in
 
00:13:25.430 --> 00:13:25.440 align:start position:0%
that I think
 
00:13:27.530 --> 00:13:27.540 align:start position:0%
I think that's what the designation of
 
00:13:28.790 --> 00:13:28.800 align:start position:0%
the anchor school was that's what we
 
00:13:31.850 --> 00:13:31.860 align:start position:0%
heard in committee was that you know the
 
00:13:33.470 --> 00:13:33.480 align:start position:0%
anchor school would prevent the parent
 
00:13:36.769 --> 00:13:36.779 align:start position:0%
from paying because it's the option
 
00:13:39.590 --> 00:13:39.600 align:start position:0%
yeah but if I may I think the issue that
 
00:13:42.110 --> 00:13:42.120 align:start position:0%
Rick is talking about though is is
 
00:13:44.269 --> 00:13:44.279 align:start position:0%
beyond just the anchor School
 
00:13:47.449 --> 00:13:47.459 align:start position:0%
that using your example of St John's for
 
00:13:49.370 --> 00:13:49.380 align:start position:0%
example St John's Academy for St
 
00:13:52.129 --> 00:13:52.139 align:start position:0%
Johnsbury where there'd be you would
 
00:13:53.750 --> 00:13:53.760 align:start position:0%
indicate I think like a five thousand
 
00:13:56.150 --> 00:13:56.160 align:start position:0%
dollar difference if I wanted to send I
 
00:13:58.310 --> 00:13:58.320 align:start position:0%
wanted my child to go there rather than
 
00:14:01.190 --> 00:14:01.200 align:start position:0%
to well it was between 500 and a
 
00:14:02.750 --> 00:14:02.760 align:start position:0%
thousand dollar difference no no high
 
00:14:04.850 --> 00:14:04.860 align:start position:0%
grants okay all right good okay
 
00:14:08.750 --> 00:14:08.760 align:start position:0%
yeah so again if I remember and chairman
 
00:14:10.910 --> 00:14:10.920 align:start position:0%
if you can remind me but again the
 
00:14:13.310 --> 00:14:13.320 align:start position:0%
conversation we had was and the reason
 
00:14:15.829 --> 00:14:15.839 align:start position:0%
why the Senate amended it was a we do
 
00:14:17.269 --> 00:14:17.279 align:start position:0%
think there should be a no cost option
 
00:14:18.889 --> 00:14:18.899 align:start position:0%
and that should be allowed and that's
 
00:14:20.990 --> 00:14:21.000 align:start position:0%
what this uh the Senate Amendment does
 
00:14:23.269 --> 00:14:23.279 align:start position:0%
it says yes you could go to a more
 
00:14:24.530 --> 00:14:24.540 align:start position:0%
expensive school and pay the difference
 
00:14:26.449 --> 00:14:26.459 align:start position:0%
but only if it's a parental choice and
 
00:14:27.889 --> 00:14:27.899 align:start position:0%
the fact that you have a public school
 
00:14:29.930 --> 00:14:29.940 align:start position:0%
option that costs you nothing that the
 
00:14:32.810 --> 00:14:32.820 align:start position:0%
school's already contracted to so if you
 
00:14:34.670 --> 00:14:34.680 align:start position:0%
want to just send your kid to school you
 
00:14:37.009 --> 00:14:37.019 align:start position:0%
have a list of approved contracted
 
00:14:39.170 --> 00:14:39.180 align:start position:0%
schools by the school board and you
 
00:14:40.970 --> 00:14:40.980 align:start position:0%
could send them there as long as the
 
00:14:43.910 --> 00:14:43.920 align:start position:0%
cost was equal to or less then but we
 
00:14:46.310 --> 00:14:46.320 align:start position:0%
also want the ability to if a parent if
 
00:14:49.009 --> 00:14:49.019 align:start position:0%
there was a reason to move to a
 
00:14:50.930 --> 00:14:50.940 align:start position:0%
different school and it was a cost
 
00:14:52.850 --> 00:14:52.860 align:start position:0%
differential and a parent wanted to do
 
00:14:54.889 --> 00:14:54.899 align:start position:0%
that choice I'm going to use the example
 
00:14:57.290 --> 00:14:57.300 align:start position:0%
of I'll go back to again Hill and say
 
00:14:59.150 --> 00:14:59.160 align:start position:0%
that if they contracted with Franklin
 
00:15:01.970 --> 00:15:01.980 align:start position:0%
and Newfound but the parent lives in
 
00:15:03.410 --> 00:15:03.420 align:start position:0%
Tilton and wants to go to win Squam
 
00:15:05.509 --> 00:15:05.519 align:start position:0%
instead so the school board it could
 
00:15:07.310 --> 00:15:07.320 align:start position:0%
form a contract and if winter Squam is
 
00:15:08.569 --> 00:15:08.579 align:start position:0%
more expensive and the parents still
 
00:15:09.829 --> 00:15:09.839 align:start position:0%
wanted to go there they would just have
 
00:15:10.970 --> 00:15:10.980 align:start position:0%
to pay the difference because it's their
 
00:15:12.470 --> 00:15:12.480 align:start position:0%
choice to go there otherwise they can
 
00:15:14.269 --> 00:15:14.279 align:start position:0%
choose the two school districts that
 
00:15:16.730 --> 00:15:16.740 align:start position:0%
cost them nothing but they shouldn't be
 
00:15:18.170 --> 00:15:18.180 align:start position:0%
given enough they shouldn't be obligated
 
00:15:20.210 --> 00:15:20.220 align:start position:0%
to pay more unless they had no cost
 
00:15:23.569 --> 00:15:23.579 align:start position:0%
option as well does that make sense so
 
00:15:25.370 --> 00:15:25.380 align:start position:0%
that's what we tried to do in this bill
 
00:15:27.949 --> 00:15:27.959 align:start position:0%
was to give that third option if a
 
00:15:29.150 --> 00:15:29.160 align:start position:0%
parent wanted to that the school
 
00:15:30.889 --> 00:15:30.899 align:start position:0%
district could at the the school
 
00:15:32.569 --> 00:15:32.579 align:start position:0%
district could enter into a contract
 
00:15:35.269 --> 00:15:35.279 align:start position:0%
with that was and then the parent if
 
00:15:36.710 --> 00:15:36.720 align:start position:0%
they wanted to do that would have to pay
 
00:15:38.449 --> 00:15:38.459 align:start position:0%
the difference yeah I understand that
 
00:15:41.930 --> 00:15:41.940 align:start position:0%
but but the concern that I have is that
 
00:15:44.509 --> 00:15:44.519 align:start position:0%
um let's say a parent wanted to send
 
00:15:47.090 --> 00:15:47.100 align:start position:0%
using your example to win a Squam but
 
00:15:49.269 --> 00:15:49.279 align:start position:0%
they can't afford to do that
 
00:15:51.290 --> 00:15:51.300 align:start position:0%
they would have two other contractual
 
00:15:52.850 --> 00:15:52.860 align:start position:0%
obligations two other public school
 
00:15:54.530 --> 00:15:54.540 align:start position:0%
options that had no cost to them so
 
00:15:56.509 --> 00:15:56.519 align:start position:0%
they've been given that choice but then
 
00:15:58.310 --> 00:15:58.320 align:start position:0%
there's a differentiation of that of
 
00:16:00.530 --> 00:16:00.540 align:start position:0%
what's available I mean there should be
 
00:16:03.050 --> 00:16:03.060 align:start position:0%
some Equity as it relates to options for
 
00:16:05.389 --> 00:16:05.399 align:start position:0%
kids even if the parent can't afford it
 
00:16:07.730 --> 00:16:07.740 align:start position:0%
for those that can't afford it but want
 
00:16:09.790 --> 00:16:09.800 align:start position:0%
to go to the same that same school
 
00:16:13.250 --> 00:16:13.260 align:start position:0%
example it's it to me I just I just
 
00:16:15.290 --> 00:16:15.300 align:start position:0%
don't think parents
 
00:16:17.210 --> 00:16:17.220 align:start position:0%
should be able to go where they want to
 
00:16:19.189 --> 00:16:19.199 align:start position:0%
go and the school district the Loke the
 
00:16:20.689 --> 00:16:20.699 align:start position:0%
resident School District should pay for
 
00:16:20.699 --> 00:16:25.189 align:start position:0%
resident School District should pay for
that

00:16:25.189 --> 00:16:25.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:27.769 --> 00:16:27.779 align:start position:0%
yeah yes I'm just thinking the same
 
00:16:29.389 --> 00:16:29.399 align:start position:0%
thing applies to when you send a child
 
00:16:31.310 --> 00:16:31.320 align:start position:0%
to college you have a whole mess of
 
00:16:32.689 --> 00:16:32.699 align:start position:0%
options and you pick probably the
 
00:16:34.790 --> 00:16:34.800 align:start position:0%
college that you can't afford I don't
 
00:16:36.530 --> 00:16:36.540 align:start position:0%
think you can go to the College of your
 
00:16:38.870 --> 00:16:38.880 align:start position:0%
choice and say I like to go here but I
 
00:16:40.850 --> 00:16:40.860 align:start position:0%
don't want to pay your tuition because I
 
00:16:42.650 --> 00:16:42.660 align:start position:0%
can't afford it you pick something that
 
00:16:46.009 --> 00:16:46.019 align:start position:0%
is fits within your finances
 
00:16:48.230 --> 00:16:48.240 align:start position:0%
well and also when you're talking about
 
00:16:50.769 --> 00:16:50.779 align:start position:0%
high school you you pick a high school
 
00:16:55.129 --> 00:16:55.139 align:start position:0%
which fits your family's needs you may
 
00:16:58.910 --> 00:16:58.920 align:start position:0%
work uh you know in a location where
 
00:17:00.889 --> 00:17:00.899 align:start position:0%
there is one of those approved schools
 
00:17:02.810 --> 00:17:02.820 align:start position:0%
and you can provide that transportation
 
00:17:04.990 --> 00:17:05.000 align:start position:0%
to that school
 
00:17:08.630 --> 00:17:08.640 align:start position:0%
and I think that in when I I look at of
 
00:17:10.970 --> 00:17:10.980 align:start position:0%
the the small District that one of them
 
00:17:13.429 --> 00:17:13.439 align:start position:0%
I have land app that is in fact the case
 
00:17:16.189 --> 00:17:16.199 align:start position:0%
where one parent works over in profile
 
00:17:19.130 --> 00:17:19.140 align:start position:0%
where profiles over towards Franconia
 
00:17:22.730 --> 00:17:22.740 align:start position:0%
and the kids go to Lisbon for a high
 
00:17:24.829 --> 00:17:24.839 align:start position:0%
school and there's also a tuition
 
00:17:26.990 --> 00:17:27.000 align:start position:0%
program they have in place to go across
 
00:17:29.510 --> 00:17:29.520 align:start position:0%
the river to St Johnsbury Academy
 
00:17:31.250 --> 00:17:31.260 align:start position:0%
it depends upon which side of the
 
00:17:32.990 --> 00:17:33.000 align:start position:0%
mountains you live on up there which way
 
00:17:35.390 --> 00:17:35.400 align:start position:0%
and which roads go where and I think all
 
00:17:38.150 --> 00:17:38.160 align:start position:0%
that's built around trying to meet the
 
00:17:40.070 --> 00:17:40.080 align:start position:0%
needs of various regions Within These
 
00:17:43.130 --> 00:17:43.140 align:start position:0%
communities that significant Geographic
 
00:17:45.409 --> 00:17:45.419 align:start position:0%
differences like they do up there this
 
00:17:47.810 --> 00:17:47.820 align:start position:0%
one yes
 
00:17:51.529 --> 00:17:51.539 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh
 
00:17:54.110 --> 00:17:54.120 align:start position:0%
the towns I represent send
 
00:17:56.930 --> 00:17:56.940 align:start position:0%
um I'll accept Newports send their high
 
00:17:58.430 --> 00:17:58.440 align:start position:0%
school students somewhere else and it's
 
00:18:02.930 --> 00:18:02.940 align:start position:0%
a combination of choice in Cornish and
 
00:18:05.390 --> 00:18:05.400 align:start position:0%
area agreements in most of the other
 
00:18:07.669 --> 00:18:07.679 align:start position:0%
schools and I think that's kind of what
 
00:18:09.110 --> 00:18:09.120 align:start position:0%
we're bordering here when you talk about
 
00:18:11.049 --> 00:18:11.059 align:start position:0%
an anchor school
 
00:18:14.270 --> 00:18:14.280 align:start position:0%
I'm just cautious because there is no
 
00:18:16.250 --> 00:18:16.260 align:start position:0%
definition of what an anchor school is
 
00:18:18.770 --> 00:18:18.780 align:start position:0%
in the statute I think I get the idea
 
00:18:21.289 --> 00:18:21.299 align:start position:0%
and I think it kind of conforms with the
 
00:18:23.510 --> 00:18:23.520 align:start position:0%
area agreement but that's a different
 
00:18:25.430 --> 00:18:25.440 align:start position:0%
kettle of fish that we I don't know if
 
00:18:27.529 --> 00:18:27.539 align:start position:0%
you want to go into but we've always
 
00:18:30.470 --> 00:18:30.480 align:start position:0%
seen high schools available in the Upper
 
00:18:33.049 --> 00:18:33.059 align:start position:0%
Valley decades ago it was a problem
 
00:18:35.270 --> 00:18:35.280 align:start position:0%
because schools didn't have room anymore
 
00:18:37.549 --> 00:18:37.559 align:start position:0%
now the problem is that they they're
 
00:18:40.310 --> 00:18:40.320 align:start position:0%
seeking students so we need to plan for
 
00:18:42.230 --> 00:18:42.240 align:start position:0%
the future not just this case that's
 
00:18:45.650 --> 00:18:45.660 align:start position:0%
going on right now there may not be a
 
00:18:48.350 --> 00:18:48.360 align:start position:0%
room available in schools does the
 
00:18:50.570 --> 00:18:50.580 align:start position:0%
school need an agreement that's that's
 
00:18:52.669 --> 00:18:52.679 align:start position:0%
going to catch everybody or just are we
 
00:18:55.130 --> 00:18:55.140 align:start position:0%
okay with schools being
 
00:18:59.210 --> 00:18:59.220 align:start position:0%
a a one of many that you can choose for
 
00:19:03.470 --> 00:19:03.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:06.950 --> 00:19:06.960 align:start position:0%
yes Senator so again anchor schools the
 
00:19:08.270 --> 00:19:08.280 align:start position:0%
interesting is again that's what we put
 
00:19:09.890 --> 00:19:09.900 align:start position:0%
in our bill and we're quickly informed
 
00:19:11.090 --> 00:19:11.100 align:start position:0%
it's actually no definition of anchor
 
00:19:12.470 --> 00:19:12.480 align:start position:0%
School anywhere in our statute so we
 
00:19:13.850 --> 00:19:13.860 align:start position:0%
have nothing and that's why we took it
 
00:19:16.130 --> 00:19:16.140 align:start position:0%
out that's why this amendment I uh
 
00:19:18.110 --> 00:19:18.120 align:start position:0%
chairman and I had a conversation we
 
00:19:19.850 --> 00:19:19.860 align:start position:0%
took that out rather than go create a
 
00:19:21.650 --> 00:19:21.660 align:start position:0%
definition that may cause a lot more
 
00:19:24.350 --> 00:19:24.360 align:start position:0%
problems down the road the idea of just
 
00:19:26.330 --> 00:19:26.340 align:start position:0%
Public Schools or public academies right
 
00:19:28.010 --> 00:19:28.020 align:start position:0%
that you can transition to any public
 
00:19:30.529 --> 00:19:30.539 align:start position:0%
school or any public Academy right but
 
00:19:32.510 --> 00:19:32.520 align:start position:0%
the school had to have at least one
 
00:19:34.370 --> 00:19:34.380 align:start position:0%
choice I was a public school or District
 
00:19:36.770 --> 00:19:36.780 align:start position:0%
had to have at least one choice that was
 
00:19:38.450 --> 00:19:38.460 align:start position:0%
free to parents right that there would
 
00:19:40.490 --> 00:19:40.500 align:start position:0%
be no additional costs so that they
 
00:19:41.930 --> 00:19:41.940 align:start position:0%
could have a
 
00:19:44.270 --> 00:19:44.280 align:start position:0%
any sense an anchor school right a free
 
00:19:46.310 --> 00:19:46.320 align:start position:0%
a cost that doesn't cost a parent any
 
00:19:48.650 --> 00:19:48.660 align:start position:0%
additional monies so it's the reason why
 
00:19:50.150 --> 00:19:50.160 align:start position:0%
we didn't stick with the in my
 
00:19:51.590 --> 00:19:51.600 align:start position:0%
conversation with the chat I think uh
 
00:19:53.150 --> 00:19:53.160 align:start position:0%
the chairman here also had conversation
 
00:19:55.850 --> 00:19:55.860 align:start position:0%
representative Ladd about
 
00:19:58.850 --> 00:19:58.860 align:start position:0%
um not keeping that phrase anchor school
 
00:20:00.590 --> 00:20:00.600 align:start position:0%
because it doesn't exist in statute
 
00:20:03.409 --> 00:20:03.419 align:start position:0%
anywhere and so we moved to just the
 
00:20:05.750 --> 00:20:05.760 align:start position:0%
concept of making sure our district had
 
00:20:08.029 --> 00:20:08.039 align:start position:0%
one public school that would for that
 
00:20:10.010 --> 00:20:10.020 align:start position:0%
grade that would cost parents nothing
 
00:20:11.570 --> 00:20:11.580 align:start position:0%
and there was there would be no
 
00:20:13.909 --> 00:20:13.919 align:start position:0%
obligation for that parent to send their
 
00:20:15.890 --> 00:20:15.900 align:start position:0%
child there but we also on the freedom
 
00:20:18.590 --> 00:20:18.600 align:start position:0%
of it if a parent so chose again using
 
00:20:20.990 --> 00:20:21.000 align:start position:0%
my example because I work in Tilton it's
 
00:20:22.789 --> 00:20:22.799 align:start position:0%
easier for me to when I'm driving to
 
00:20:24.230 --> 00:20:24.240 align:start position:0%
school to drop my kid off right in
 
00:20:26.029 --> 00:20:26.039 align:start position:0%
Tilton rather than go the other
 
00:20:28.310 --> 00:20:28.320 align:start position:0%
direction go to Newfound which is not in
 
00:20:29.690 --> 00:20:29.700 align:start position:0%
the direction where I'm going to work so
 
00:20:31.070 --> 00:20:31.080 align:start position:0%
I'm going to choose to go there but it
 
00:20:33.110 --> 00:20:33.120 align:start position:0%
may cost me more money that's my choice
 
00:20:35.150 --> 00:20:35.160 align:start position:0%
as a parent otherwise my obligation is I
 
00:20:36.350 --> 00:20:36.360 align:start position:0%
got to take them the Newfound where
 
00:20:38.810 --> 00:20:38.820 align:start position:0%
there's no cost
 
00:20:41.330 --> 00:20:41.340 align:start position:0%
they make a follow-up comment yes I've
 
00:20:43.070 --> 00:20:43.080 align:start position:0%
seen the choice
 
00:20:46.970 --> 00:20:46.980 align:start position:0%
option work in Cornish because it
 
00:20:49.250 --> 00:20:49.260 align:start position:0%
Cornish pays a cap if you want to go
 
00:20:51.470 --> 00:20:51.480 align:start position:0%
with school that's cap or under great if
 
00:20:53.750 --> 00:20:53.760 align:start position:0%
you want to go over you pay the
 
00:20:55.850 --> 00:20:55.860 align:start position:0%
overpized nobody has a problem with it
 
00:20:58.570 --> 00:20:58.580 align:start position:0%
it works very well it works for the town
 
00:21:00.409 --> 00:21:00.419 align:start position:0%
some of the towns that have area
 
00:21:02.390 --> 00:21:02.400 align:start position:0%
agreements uh parents are jealous
 
00:21:05.270 --> 00:21:05.280 align:start position:0%
because they're really just stuck in one
 
00:21:08.150 --> 00:21:08.160 align:start position:0%
option and uh and appreciate the freedom
 
00:21:10.070 --> 00:21:10.080 align:start position:0%
that it gives the students in Cornish
 
00:21:15.830 --> 00:21:15.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:17.570 --> 00:21:17.580 align:start position:0%
you know in your District over there
 
00:21:19.250 --> 00:21:19.260 align:start position:0%
were you talking about around Newport
 
00:21:21.230 --> 00:21:21.240 align:start position:0%
and all they also had another school
 
00:21:24.650 --> 00:21:24.660 align:start position:0%
which was tuition School uh Sunapee
 
00:21:29.029 --> 00:21:29.039 align:start position:0%
and Sunapee uh was you know I think that
 
00:21:30.590 --> 00:21:30.600 align:start position:0%
brings in part of the issue why we need
 
00:21:32.690 --> 00:21:32.700 align:start position:0%
to do something because they were doing
 
00:21:35.090 --> 00:21:35.100 align:start position:0%
something very different in terms of
 
00:21:44.130 --> 00:21:44.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:44.140 --> 00:21:46.310 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

00:21:46.310 --> 00:21:46.320 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:21:49.390 --> 00:21:49.400 align:start position:0%
okay your neck of the woods yeah yes and
 
00:21:52.669 --> 00:21:52.679 align:start position:0%
Croydon Croydon and Goshen and all that
 
00:21:56.510 --> 00:21:56.520 align:start position:0%
up there and and and uh the the anchor
 
00:21:58.970 --> 00:21:58.980 align:start position:0%
school was was Newport
 
00:22:01.789 --> 00:22:01.799 align:start position:0%
and sanofi reserved the right to say
 
00:22:04.190 --> 00:22:04.200 align:start position:0%
well we don't have this programming so
 
00:22:07.190 --> 00:22:07.200 align:start position:0%
we can't take that particular student
 
00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:08.630 align:start position:0%
we can't take that particular student
um

00:22:08.630 --> 00:22:08.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:22:10.430 --> 00:22:10.440 align:start position:0%
so the show last thing so again I guess
 
00:22:12.350 --> 00:22:12.360 align:start position:0%
I'm still just struggling why we want to
 
00:22:15.289 --> 00:22:15.299 align:start position:0%
have that once one section of a sentence
 
00:22:17.210 --> 00:22:17.220 align:start position:0%
in there that has comply with the
 
00:22:18.950 --> 00:22:18.960 align:start position:0%
provisions of which limits at the high
 
00:22:21.289 --> 00:22:21.299 align:start position:0%
school and why we wouldn't just strike
 
00:22:23.210 --> 00:22:23.220 align:start position:0%
that from complying all the way to the
 
00:22:25.850 --> 00:22:25.860 align:start position:0%
RSA that just says Academy that does not
 
00:22:27.590 --> 00:22:27.600 align:start position:0%
require additional payment this allows
 
00:22:31.250 --> 00:22:31.260 align:start position:0%
as I read through 193.3
 
00:22:32.990 --> 00:22:33.000 align:start position:0%
um nothing in here talks about just high
 
00:22:35.390 --> 00:22:35.400 align:start position:0%
school it's about all grades well I I
 
00:22:37.370 --> 00:22:37.380 align:start position:0%
agree with you that we can have it
 
00:22:39.770 --> 00:22:39.780 align:start position:0%
referencing that statute because that's
 
00:22:42.970 --> 00:22:42.980 align:start position:0%
just a statute for high schools alone
 
00:22:46.190 --> 00:22:46.200 align:start position:0%
and so I and I that was recognized after
 
00:22:50.149 --> 00:22:50.159 align:start position:0%
this was put together so yeah if
 
00:22:52.070 --> 00:22:52.080 align:start position:0%
if something were to go forward as I
 
00:22:53.810 --> 00:22:53.820 align:start position:0%
would tend to support you know the
 
00:22:55.549 --> 00:22:55.559 align:start position:0%
academy that does not require additional
 
00:22:57.289 --> 00:22:57.299 align:start position:0%
you know from that on taking that
 
00:23:00.350 --> 00:23:00.360 align:start position:0%
language out of the reference but then
 
00:23:02.930 --> 00:23:02.940 align:start position:0%
the question is it's still Romans 6 but
 
00:23:05.210 --> 00:23:05.220 align:start position:0%
it's underneath change of school or
 
00:23:08.450 --> 00:23:08.460 align:start position:0%
assignment School tuition program
 
00:23:08.460 --> 00:23:09.110 align:start position:0%
assignment School tuition program
um

00:23:09.110 --> 00:23:09.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:09.120 --> 00:23:13.850 align:start position:0%
um
193.3

00:23:13.850 --> 00:23:13.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:16.549 --> 00:23:16.559 align:start position:0%
is that
 
00:23:18.830 --> 00:23:18.840 align:start position:0%
the proper place for this
 
00:23:21.169 --> 00:23:21.179 align:start position:0%
is where the statute is now yeah and
 
00:23:22.970 --> 00:23:22.980 align:start position:0%
that's our interactions are so messed up
 
00:23:24.770 --> 00:23:24.780 align:start position:0%
yeah so that's that's part of the
 
00:23:24.780 --> 00:23:25.730 align:start position:0%
yeah so that's that's part of the
problem

00:23:25.730 --> 00:23:25.740 align:start position:0%
problem
 
00:23:28.370 --> 00:23:28.380 align:start position:0%
Senator just a question I guess
 
00:23:30.529 --> 00:23:30.539 align:start position:0%
um how would Transportation fit into
 
00:23:33.049 --> 00:23:33.059 align:start position:0%
this in terms of if a child chooses a
 
00:23:35.210 --> 00:23:35.220 align:start position:0%
different school who is a transportation
 
00:23:36.590 --> 00:23:36.600 align:start position:0%
included in that cost or is the parent
 
00:23:43.310 --> 00:23:43.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:46.390 --> 00:23:46.400 align:start position:0%
I think if you look at 194
 
00:23:49.070 --> 00:23:49.080 align:start position:0%
22 I think that's the sectional law
 
00:23:52.070 --> 00:23:52.080 align:start position:0%
which they talk about the contract can
 
00:23:54.890 --> 00:23:54.900 align:start position:0%
provide for that if the if the the
 
00:23:57.590 --> 00:23:57.600 align:start position:0%
distance or transportation is needed
 
00:24:03.169 --> 00:24:03.179 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:05.990 --> 00:24:06.000 align:start position:0%
I think that that is also taken care by
 
00:24:08.450 --> 00:24:08.460 align:start position:0%
you know the anchor is one of which I
 
00:24:10.730 --> 00:24:10.740 align:start position:0%
know in the district I am transportation
 
00:24:12.710 --> 00:24:12.720 align:start position:0%
is provided
 
00:24:14.810 --> 00:24:14.820 align:start position:0%
to all those schools
 
00:24:17.210 --> 00:24:17.220 align:start position:0%
except for Thetford Academy
 
00:24:19.549 --> 00:24:19.559 align:start position:0%
and the St Johnsbury Academy for
 
00:24:22.990 --> 00:24:23.000 align:start position:0%
Bradford for Woodsville for ribbon River
 
00:24:27.350 --> 00:24:27.360 align:start position:0%
Rivendell it's all provided they link up
 
00:24:29.270 --> 00:24:29.280 align:start position:0%
with that other district and they meet
 
00:24:31.190 --> 00:24:31.200 align:start position:0%
buses get your kids get off get on
 
00:24:32.390 --> 00:24:32.400 align:start position:0%
another bus
 
00:24:35.029 --> 00:24:35.039 align:start position:0%
and go to school so
 
00:24:38.330 --> 00:24:38.340 align:start position:0%
but also statutorily we're not required
 
00:24:40.850 --> 00:24:40.860 align:start position:0%
by law to provide transportation
 
00:24:43.490 --> 00:24:43.500 align:start position:0%
for 9 through 12.
 
00:24:46.310 --> 00:24:46.320 align:start position:0%
we highly recommend that we we put that
 
00:24:48.770 --> 00:24:48.780 align:start position:0%
in some of our finance law before but if
 
00:24:51.289 --> 00:24:51.299 align:start position:0%
we're we're going to get rid of
 
00:24:53.870 --> 00:24:53.880 align:start position:0%
the high school option and conclude this
 
00:24:55.549 --> 00:24:55.559 align:start position:0%
for elementary as well and we statutory
 
00:24:57.890 --> 00:24:57.900 align:start position:0%
required yes then we are
 
00:25:00.350 --> 00:25:00.360 align:start position:0%
then we are
 
00:25:00.360 --> 00:25:01.730 align:start position:0%
then we are
yes

00:25:01.730 --> 00:25:01.740 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:25:04.070 --> 00:25:04.080 align:start position:0%
but again I just remind everybody that
 
00:25:06.590 --> 00:25:06.600 align:start position:0%
where this section of law already exists
 
00:25:08.690 --> 00:25:08.700 align:start position:0%
yeah right we're not changing that at
 
00:25:10.430 --> 00:25:10.440 align:start position:0%
all the only thing we're doing is saying
 
00:25:13.370 --> 00:25:13.380 align:start position:0%
we're we're allowing that option of a
 
00:25:15.590 --> 00:25:15.600 align:start position:0%
parent can choose a contracted School
 
00:25:18.529 --> 00:25:18.539 align:start position:0%
outside of that costs more than the
 
00:25:19.730 --> 00:25:19.740 align:start position:0%
minimum amount be able to pay that
 
00:25:21.409 --> 00:25:21.419 align:start position:0%
because current law
 
00:25:23.990 --> 00:25:24.000 align:start position:0%
is ambiguous at best so whether or not
 
00:25:26.570 --> 00:25:26.580 align:start position:0%
it allows that or not and this clearly
 
00:25:28.789 --> 00:25:28.799 align:start position:0%
clarifies that they can do that if there
 
00:25:30.409 --> 00:25:30.419 align:start position:0%
is a cost but they have to have that
 
00:25:32.210 --> 00:25:32.220 align:start position:0%
free option for any parent as well for
 
00:25:34.789 --> 00:25:34.799 align:start position:0%
the people that choose not to so again I
 
00:25:36.289 --> 00:25:36.299 align:start position:0%
I I don't want to get into the
 
00:25:37.310 --> 00:25:37.320 align:start position:0%
transportation argument because that's
 
00:25:38.990 --> 00:25:39.000 align:start position:0%
already covered underneath the set that
 
00:25:41.390 --> 00:25:41.400 align:start position:0%
chapter the section six doesn't talk
 
00:25:43.430 --> 00:25:43.440 align:start position:0%
about transportation in any way shape or
 
00:25:46.490 --> 00:25:46.500 align:start position:0%
form so it there's some that that is in
 
00:25:48.169 --> 00:25:48.179 align:start position:0%
some other section somewhere else oh
 
00:25:50.090 --> 00:25:50.100 align:start position:0%
they were considering there's another
 
00:25:52.370 --> 00:25:52.380 align:start position:0%
whether or not we want to allow parents
 
00:25:55.310 --> 00:25:55.320 align:start position:0%
the right to pick a school that may cost
 
00:25:58.010 --> 00:25:58.020 align:start position:0%
more and pay the difference or not
 
00:25:58.020 --> 00:26:05.750 align:start position:0%
more and pay the difference or not
foreign

00:26:05.750 --> 00:26:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:08.029 --> 00:26:08.039 align:start position:0%
don't have a lot of experience in New
 
00:26:10.370 --> 00:26:10.380 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but I do and others and I'm
 
00:26:13.370 --> 00:26:13.380 align:start position:0%
wondering how those circumstances which
 
00:26:15.950 --> 00:26:15.960 align:start position:0%
we discussed in committee one time
 
00:26:18.169 --> 00:26:18.179 align:start position:0%
involving um
 
00:26:20.690 --> 00:26:20.700 align:start position:0%
an involuntary if you will transfer
 
00:26:23.890 --> 00:26:23.900 align:start position:0%
someone who's being abused or are
 
00:26:26.630 --> 00:26:26.640 align:start position:0%
mistreated in one school needs to
 
00:26:28.970 --> 00:26:28.980 align:start position:0%
transfer to the other and then do we
 
00:26:32.029 --> 00:26:32.039 align:start position:0%
have the same questions as who pays what
 
00:26:34.909 --> 00:26:34.919 align:start position:0%
does it cost I just don't understand how
 
00:26:37.730 --> 00:26:37.740 align:start position:0%
that's handled and so I'm asking well in
 
00:26:39.890 --> 00:26:39.900 align:start position:0%
the cases of uh like homelessness
 
00:26:41.870 --> 00:26:41.880 align:start position:0%
mckinney-vento definitely takes care of
 
00:26:44.390 --> 00:26:44.400 align:start position:0%
that excuse me takes care of that and
 
00:26:47.149 --> 00:26:47.159 align:start position:0%
HHS if you're in if you get into abuse
 
00:26:49.310 --> 00:26:49.320 align:start position:0%
and neglect so transportation is taking
 
00:26:50.690 --> 00:26:50.700 align:start position:0%
care of those type of students
 
00:26:53.090 --> 00:26:53.100 align:start position:0%
regardless we've had that up where I am
 
00:26:55.970 --> 00:26:55.980 align:start position:0%
where we could only find living quarters
 
00:26:58.850 --> 00:26:58.860 align:start position:0%
for some individuals down in Hanover but
 
00:27:00.049 --> 00:27:00.059 align:start position:0%
the student was going to school in
 
00:27:02.930 --> 00:27:02.940 align:start position:0%
Woodsville which is a good 45 minute
 
00:27:05.450 --> 00:27:05.460 align:start position:0%
Ride Transportation was provided so this
 
00:27:08.750 --> 00:27:08.760 align:start position:0%
the educational program wasn't disrupted
 
00:27:18.110 --> 00:27:18.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:19.970 --> 00:27:19.980 align:start position:0%
so it's obviously I'm okay with the
 
00:27:21.769 --> 00:27:21.779 align:start position:0%
amendment striking as long as we strike
 
00:27:24.590 --> 00:27:24.600 align:start position:0%
that one line to to deal with complying
 
00:27:26.930 --> 00:27:26.940 align:start position:0%
all the way to the irsa I think that
 
00:27:29.210 --> 00:27:29.220 align:start position:0%
again this allows parents some some
 
00:27:32.510 --> 00:27:32.520 align:start position:0%
flexibility for if they know they've got
 
00:27:34.490 --> 00:27:34.500 align:start position:0%
to go out of the town anyway because the
 
00:27:37.190 --> 00:27:37.200 align:start position:0%
town doesn't have a grade that matches
 
00:27:39.169 --> 00:27:39.179 align:start position:0%
their student this just gives them more
 
00:27:45.769 --> 00:27:45.779 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:48.230 --> 00:27:48.240 align:start position:0%
so further discuss should we just take a
 
00:27:51.409 --> 00:27:51.419 align:start position:0%
moment and break by House and Senate and
 
00:27:53.690 --> 00:27:53.700 align:start position:0%
see where we stand
 
00:27:55.730 --> 00:27:55.740 align:start position:0%
are we talking about now just striking
 
00:27:59.390 --> 00:27:59.400 align:start position:0%
out the exactly what the reference to
 
00:28:00.890 --> 00:28:00.900 align:start position:0%
the RSA
 
00:28:03.289 --> 00:28:03.299 align:start position:0%
and leaving designated as to Anchor
 
00:28:05.330 --> 00:28:05.340 align:start position:0%
School in
 
00:28:05.340 --> 00:28:06.529 align:start position:0%
School in
okay

00:28:06.529 --> 00:28:06.539 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:28:09.049 --> 00:28:09.059 align:start position:0%
no no no no yeah no it's your your
 
00:28:11.630 --> 00:28:11.640 align:start position:0%
Amendment which says which changes to
 
00:28:13.370 --> 00:28:13.380 align:start position:0%
public school the public Academy then
 
00:28:15.830 --> 00:28:15.840 align:start position:0%
striking complying with all the way to
 
00:28:17.630 --> 00:28:17.640 align:start position:0%
the word that so okay lying with the
 
00:28:19.850 --> 00:28:19.860 align:start position:0%
provisions of RSA blah blah blah strike
 
00:28:21.950 --> 00:28:21.960 align:start position:0%
that those one two three four five six
 
00:28:24.890 --> 00:28:24.900 align:start position:0%
yeah six words and leaving the rest and
 
00:28:26.690 --> 00:28:26.700 align:start position:0%
that amendment I could support because
 
00:28:28.370 --> 00:28:28.380 align:start position:0%
again we're keeping it to Public Schools
 
00:28:29.990 --> 00:28:30.000 align:start position:0%
we're keeping it
 
00:28:33.350 --> 00:28:33.360 align:start position:0%
um to all grades and just increasing
 
00:28:34.909 --> 00:28:34.919 align:start position:0%
flexibility and options for New
 
00:28:36.710 --> 00:28:36.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire parents
 
00:28:36.720 --> 00:28:38.210 align:start position:0%
Hampshire parents
okay

00:28:38.210 --> 00:28:38.220 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:28:41.510 --> 00:28:41.520 align:start position:0%
good to break for a second here
 
00:28:43.430 --> 00:28:43.440 align:start position:0%
we'll go steal an office out there for
 
00:28:43.440 --> 00:55:20.030 align:start position:0%
we'll go steal an office out there for
you

00:55:20.030 --> 00:55:20.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:23.089 --> 00:55:23.099 align:start position:0%
hey we're we're back right now and what
 
00:55:24.650 --> 00:55:24.660 align:start position:0%
we're going to do is we're going to take
 
00:55:27.530 --> 00:55:27.540 align:start position:0%
a break and we're going to ask that an
 
00:55:31.849 --> 00:55:31.859 align:start position:0%
amendment be created uh based upon uh
 
00:55:31.859 --> 00:55:33.309 align:start position:0%
amendment be created uh based upon uh
the

00:55:33.309 --> 00:55:33.319 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:55:35.450 --> 00:55:35.460 align:start position:0%
laddling Amendment which we haven't
 
00:55:37.309 --> 00:55:37.319 align:start position:0%
found is taking out the words complying
 
00:55:41.450 --> 00:55:41.460 align:start position:0%
with the provisions of RSA 19424e
 
00:55:43.670 --> 00:55:43.680 align:start position:0%
and we'll have that Amendment back and
 
00:55:45.170 --> 00:55:45.180 align:start position:0%
we will take a break and we'll come back
 
00:55:47.270 --> 00:55:47.280 align:start position:0%
uh following the next committee
 
00:55:47.280 --> 00:55:48.530 align:start position:0%
uh following the next committee
conference

00:55:48.530 --> 00:55:48.540 align:start position:0%
conference
 
00:55:51.530 --> 00:55:51.540 align:start position:0%
and and take action on on that amendment
 
00:55:55.130 --> 00:55:55.140 align:start position:0%
that time so we're breaking right now
 
01:03:46.089 --> 01:03:46.099 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:48.829 --> 01:03:48.839 align:start position:0%
okay we have the next committee
 
01:03:51.410 --> 01:03:51.420 align:start position:0%
conference coming up here and it's uh HP

01:04:38.390 --> 01:04:38.400 align:start position:0%
Charter Public School
 
01:04:41.809 --> 01:04:41.819 align:start position:0%
uh is there any objection to that
 
01:04:46.490 --> 01:04:46.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:49.010 --> 01:04:49.020 align:start position:0%
yeah I don't no no need to rehash this
 
01:04:53.569 --> 01:04:53.579 align:start position:0%
but I am again immense light so yeah and
 
01:04:55.370 --> 01:04:55.380 align:start position:0%
representative luno
 
01:04:57.410 --> 01:04:57.420 align:start position:0%
sure I mean I would I would suggest
 
01:04:58.970 --> 01:04:58.980 align:start position:0%
moving forward with the house position
 
01:05:00.589 --> 01:05:00.599 align:start position:0%
which would be deleting the um
 
01:05:02.270 --> 01:05:02.280 align:start position:0%
non-germaine Amendment
 
01:05:02.280 --> 01:05:04.970 align:start position:0%
non-germaine Amendment
okay

01:05:04.970 --> 01:05:04.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:10.309 --> 01:05:10.319 align:start position:0%
yes so uh well Senator fan knows this uh
 
01:05:12.170 --> 01:05:12.180 align:start position:0%
oh for the house side I'll explain why
 
01:05:13.549 --> 01:05:13.559 align:start position:0%
this bill was brought it why this
 
01:05:16.069 --> 01:05:16.079 align:start position:0%
amendment was brought in and why um we
 
01:05:17.750 --> 01:05:17.760 align:start position:0%
adopted this
 
01:05:20.750 --> 01:05:20.760 align:start position:0%
um so this originally was a bill that
 
01:05:22.750 --> 01:05:22.760 align:start position:0%
was submitted by representative Hill
 
01:05:27.230 --> 01:05:27.240 align:start position:0%
however OLS forgot to draft it so they
 
01:05:29.210 --> 01:05:29.220 align:start position:0%
literally put put the request in they
 
01:05:30.650 --> 01:05:30.660 align:start position:0%
acknowledged the request and then they
 
01:05:31.970 --> 01:05:31.980 align:start position:0%
never drafted his bill and it wasn't
 
01:05:34.010 --> 01:05:34.020 align:start position:0%
until January that he realized that it
 
01:05:36.770 --> 01:05:36.780 align:start position:0%
never got drafted and so
 
01:05:39.470 --> 01:05:39.480 align:start position:0%
um oh well I got the OLS from the
 
01:05:40.910 --> 01:05:40.920 align:start position:0%
director showing that it was their fault
 
01:05:42.589 --> 01:05:42.599 align:start position:0%
that they forgot to draft it so we added
 
01:05:44.030 --> 01:05:44.040 align:start position:0%
as a non-dairain amendment to this bill
 
01:05:46.370 --> 01:05:46.380 align:start position:0%
allow the bill to go forward but the
 
01:05:47.630 --> 01:05:47.640 align:start position:0%
reason the bill was brought forward
 
01:05:51.109 --> 01:05:51.119 align:start position:0%
originally was because this law is a
 
01:05:53.390 --> 01:05:53.400 align:start position:0%
fairly new law that was put into play to
 
01:05:54.890 --> 01:05:54.900 align:start position:0%
allow for the transition of public
 
01:05:56.569 --> 01:05:56.579 align:start position:0%
school property from one Public School
 
01:05:58.190 --> 01:05:58.200 align:start position:0%
entity to another Public School entity
 
01:05:59.630 --> 01:05:59.640 align:start position:0%
going from a Traditional School to a
 
01:06:02.210 --> 01:06:02.220 align:start position:0%
charter school in the original bill when
 
01:06:04.010 --> 01:06:04.020 align:start position:0%
it was put in way back when that created
 
01:06:05.690 --> 01:06:05.700 align:start position:0%
this law
 
01:06:07.910 --> 01:06:07.920 align:start position:0%
um there was a timeline put into the
 
01:06:10.849 --> 01:06:10.859 align:start position:0%
bill to allow for the to have the school
 
01:06:12.410 --> 01:06:12.420 align:start position:0%
district respond and have the action
 
01:06:14.930 --> 01:06:14.940 align:start position:0%
taken however somewhere in a committee
 
01:06:17.390 --> 01:06:17.400 align:start position:0%
it was decided it wasn't needed and
 
01:06:19.609 --> 01:06:19.619 align:start position:0%
therefore it was it was amended out of
 
01:06:22.069 --> 01:06:22.079 align:start position:0%
the bill and just left to the language
 
01:06:24.289 --> 01:06:24.299 align:start position:0%
that was there the problem is the first
 
01:06:27.170 --> 01:06:27.180 align:start position:0%
time the law went to go to be used
 
01:06:28.670 --> 01:06:28.680 align:start position:0%
um in and again it was in my district
 
01:06:30.470 --> 01:06:30.480 align:start position:0%
when a Squam
 
01:06:32.930 --> 01:06:32.940 align:start position:0%
um when a Squam downsized their campus
 
01:06:35.510 --> 01:06:35.520 align:start position:0%
and ended up having a building on a
 
01:06:37.069 --> 01:06:37.079 align:start position:0%
separate parcel of land that was free
 
01:06:39.589 --> 01:06:39.599 align:start position:0%
and available and the charter school put
 
01:06:42.589 --> 01:06:42.599 align:start position:0%
in an offer and it was completely
 
01:06:44.210 --> 01:06:44.220 align:start position:0%
ignored by the school board for nine
 
01:06:44.220 --> 01:06:45.589 align:start position:0%
ignored by the school board for nine
months

01:06:45.589 --> 01:06:45.599 align:start position:0%
months
 
01:06:47.270 --> 01:06:47.280 align:start position:0%
um not acknowledged in any way shape or
 
01:06:49.250 --> 01:06:49.260 align:start position:0%
form no negotiations happened nothing
 
01:06:49.260 --> 01:06:50.630 align:start position:0%
form no negotiations happened nothing
happened

01:06:50.630 --> 01:06:50.640 align:start position:0%
happened
 
01:06:53.089 --> 01:06:53.099 align:start position:0%
um and so that wasn't the intent of this
 
01:06:55.309 --> 01:06:55.319 align:start position:0%
law the intent wasn't that to allow
 
01:06:57.710 --> 01:06:57.720 align:start position:0%
school districts to ignore an offer put
 
01:07:00.109 --> 01:07:00.119 align:start position:0%
in by a charter school and so this bill
 
01:07:02.270 --> 01:07:02.280 align:start position:0%
came forward to require that school
 
01:07:04.789 --> 01:07:04.799 align:start position:0%
boards act in some way shape or form and
 
01:07:06.710 --> 01:07:06.720 align:start position:0%
start negotiations do something they
 
01:07:08.930 --> 01:07:08.940 align:start position:0%
literally did not even meet with the
 
01:07:11.930 --> 01:07:11.940 align:start position:0%
charter school for for nine months on
 
01:07:14.450 --> 01:07:14.460 align:start position:0%
the offer or offer a counter offer or do
 
01:07:17.150 --> 01:07:17.160 align:start position:0%
anything and so that's the reason why
 
01:07:20.089 --> 01:07:20.099 align:start position:0%
this bill was brought forward was again
 
01:07:22.130 --> 01:07:22.140 align:start position:0%
first through an AWS error second
 
01:07:24.349 --> 01:07:24.359 align:start position:0%
because in in the first instance of the
 
01:07:26.029 --> 01:07:26.039 align:start position:0%
law being used the timelines were
 
01:07:28.270 --> 01:07:28.280 align:start position:0%
necessary in order to create some action
 
01:07:31.309 --> 01:07:31.319 align:start position:0%
so that's why that's why we have the
 
01:07:33.349 --> 01:07:33.359 align:start position:0%
amendment in front of us I think it's
 
01:07:35.690 --> 01:07:35.700 align:start position:0%
it's reasonable I I want to remind
 
01:07:37.609 --> 01:07:37.619 align:start position:0%
everybody that this is a transfer of
 
01:07:39.470 --> 01:07:39.480 align:start position:0%
property from a public school entity to
 
01:07:41.210 --> 01:07:41.220 align:start position:0%
a public school entity it's going from a
 
01:07:43.250 --> 01:07:43.260 align:start position:0%
traditional school to a public charter
 
01:07:45.349 --> 01:07:45.359 align:start position:0%
school so this isn't about private sale
 
01:07:47.630 --> 01:07:47.640 align:start position:0%
to a private school this is about a
 
01:07:50.450 --> 01:07:50.460 align:start position:0%
public school to a public school action
 
01:07:50.460 --> 01:07:52.569 align:start position:0%
public school to a public school action
yes

01:07:52.569 --> 01:07:52.579 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:07:55.370 --> 01:07:55.380 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr a lot to unpack
 
01:07:55.380 --> 01:07:56.390 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr a lot to unpack
there

01:07:56.390 --> 01:07:56.400 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:08:00.069 --> 01:08:00.079 align:start position:0%
um the um uh you know the errors happen
 
01:08:04.430 --> 01:08:04.440 align:start position:0%
you know in operations so I don't think
 
01:08:05.870 --> 01:08:05.880 align:start position:0%
that I don't think the fact that it
 
01:08:08.750 --> 01:08:08.760 align:start position:0%
never happened necessarily justifies
 
01:08:10.730 --> 01:08:10.740 align:start position:0%
um the um the subject matter of an
 
01:08:13.430 --> 01:08:13.440 align:start position:0%
amendment but um but I want to I want to
 
01:08:15.890 --> 01:08:15.900 align:start position:0%
start with what um uh Senator Lang just
 
01:08:18.890 --> 01:08:18.900 align:start position:0%
just said no I want to be really really
 
01:08:18.900 --> 01:08:20.390 align:start position:0%
just said no I want to be really really
clear

01:08:20.390 --> 01:08:20.400 align:start position:0%
clear
 
01:08:22.729 --> 01:08:22.739 align:start position:0%
um a public chart charter schools are
 
01:08:25.070 --> 01:08:25.080 align:start position:0%
public schools but they're not public
 
01:08:26.870 --> 01:08:26.880 align:start position:0%
organizations they're private
 
01:08:29.450 --> 01:08:29.460 align:start position:0%
organizations they're they're they are
 
01:08:33.410 --> 01:08:33.420 align:start position:0%
operated under IRS code 501c3 uh
 
01:08:35.749 --> 01:08:35.759 align:start position:0%
corporations it's a private Corporation
 
01:08:38.510 --> 01:08:38.520 align:start position:0%
non-profit Corporation private not
 
01:08:41.809 --> 01:08:41.819 align:start position:0%
public it's not run Charter Schools not
 
01:08:44.150 --> 01:08:44.160 align:start position:0%
run by publicly elected boards they
 
01:08:47.030 --> 01:08:47.040 align:start position:0%
don't have any um obligations back to
 
01:08:47.040 --> 01:08:49.189 align:start position:0%
don't have any um obligations back to
taxpayers

01:08:49.189 --> 01:08:49.199 align:start position:0%
taxpayers
 
01:08:49.199 --> 01:08:49.729 align:start position:0%
taxpayers
um

01:08:49.729 --> 01:08:49.739 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:52.550 --> 01:08:52.560 align:start position:0%
um they um they don't follow
 
01:08:53.870 --> 01:08:53.880 align:start position:0%
um uh public
 
01:08:53.880 --> 01:08:54.550 align:start position:0%
um uh public
um

01:08:54.550 --> 01:08:54.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:58.189 --> 01:08:58.199 align:start position:0%
you know 91a laws they are private
 
01:09:01.789 --> 01:09:01.799 align:start position:0%
organizations so so let's be absolutely
 
01:09:04.130 --> 01:09:04.140 align:start position:0%
clear that the subject matter that this
 
01:09:06.829 --> 01:09:06.839 align:start position:0%
amendment does is about selling public
 
01:09:09.890 --> 01:09:09.900 align:start position:0%
property to a private organization the
 
01:09:11.269 --> 01:09:11.279 align:start position:0%
private organization it's a charter
 
01:09:12.950 --> 01:09:12.960 align:start position:0%
school but it's still a private
 
01:09:15.470 --> 01:09:15.480 align:start position:0%
organization from the from a technical
 
01:09:15.480 --> 01:09:16.610 align:start position:0%
organization from the from a technical
standpoint

01:09:16.610 --> 01:09:16.620 align:start position:0%
standpoint
 
01:09:21.470 --> 01:09:21.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:23.570 --> 01:09:23.580 align:start position:0%
you know the other the other point I
 
01:09:23.580 --> 01:09:24.709 align:start position:0%
you know the other the other point I
think

01:09:24.709 --> 01:09:24.719 align:start position:0%
think
 
01:09:27.289 --> 01:09:27.299 align:start position:0%
um is worth um is worth making let me
 
01:09:30.169 --> 01:09:30.179 align:start position:0%
just go back to it here is that um is
 
01:09:32.990 --> 01:09:33.000 align:start position:0%
well actually it's more of a question
 
01:09:35.510 --> 01:09:35.520 align:start position:0%
um how in the case of the the winner
 
01:09:35.520 --> 01:09:36.829 align:start position:0%
um how in the case of the the winner
Squam

01:09:36.829 --> 01:09:36.839 align:start position:0%
Squam
 
01:09:39.050 --> 01:09:39.060 align:start position:0%
um situation how did that turn out in
 
01:09:40.789 --> 01:09:40.799 align:start position:0%
the end what happened
 
01:09:42.650 --> 01:09:42.660 align:start position:0%
ultimately after not receiving any other
 
01:09:44.510 --> 01:09:44.520 align:start position:0%
bids they'll end up moving forward with
 
01:09:46.309 --> 01:09:46.319 align:start position:0%
the charter school but again it wasn't
 
01:09:48.110 --> 01:09:48.120 align:start position:0%
until they waited and waited the way to
 
01:09:49.189 --> 01:09:49.199 align:start position:0%
the charter school was trying to figure
 
01:09:50.630 --> 01:09:50.640 align:start position:0%
out what it was doing
 
01:09:52.910 --> 01:09:52.920 align:start position:0%
so again ultimately it ended up with the
 
01:09:54.410 --> 01:09:54.420 align:start position:0%
charter school and the charter school is
 
01:09:56.390 --> 01:09:56.400 align:start position:0%
buying it but the point is that they
 
01:09:58.790 --> 01:09:58.800 align:start position:0%
were left in limbo for nine months and
 
01:10:00.590 --> 01:10:00.600 align:start position:0%
they shouldn't have been right the law
 
01:10:02.390 --> 01:10:02.400 align:start position:0%
was clear that
 
01:10:04.550 --> 01:10:04.560 align:start position:0%
um they they have the right of the right
 
01:10:07.550 --> 01:10:07.560 align:start position:0%
of uh of getting the unused facility but
 
01:10:09.169 --> 01:10:09.179 align:start position:0%
the school district took no action when
 
01:10:10.370 --> 01:10:10.380 align:start position:0%
we contacted the Attorney General's
 
01:10:11.390 --> 01:10:11.400 align:start position:0%
office they said there was absolutely
 
01:10:12.709 --> 01:10:12.719 align:start position:0%
nothing they could do because there was
 
01:10:14.090 --> 01:10:14.100 align:start position:0%
no timelines in the law that would
 
01:10:16.189 --> 01:10:16.199 align:start position:0%
require them to take action so they
 
01:10:18.050 --> 01:10:18.060 align:start position:0%
could wait five years and then say no or
 
01:10:20.990 --> 01:10:21.000 align:start position:0%
five years and say yes the law had no
 
01:10:24.050 --> 01:10:24.060 align:start position:0%
obligations in it for timeliness and so
 
01:10:25.910 --> 01:10:25.920 align:start position:0%
that's why the that's why this came
 
01:10:27.050 --> 01:10:27.060 align:start position:0%
forward is again the Attorney General
 
01:10:28.669 --> 01:10:28.679 align:start position:0%
said they could do nothing because the
 
01:10:31.070 --> 01:10:31.080 align:start position:0%
law had no timelines built into it so so
 
01:10:35.209 --> 01:10:35.219 align:start position:0%
the the women Squam could still have
 
01:10:38.149 --> 01:10:38.159 align:start position:0%
uh well if there was a timeline place
 
01:10:41.510 --> 01:10:41.520 align:start position:0%
they could still just um not accept the
 
01:10:43.189 --> 01:10:43.199 align:start position:0%
uh the offer from the charter school and
 
01:10:44.810 --> 01:10:44.820 align:start position:0%
that would have been okay that would
 
01:10:46.070 --> 01:10:46.080 align:start position:0%
have been fine again it's just an
 
01:10:48.050 --> 01:10:48.060 align:start position:0%
obligation to act and it was you know
 
01:10:49.250 --> 01:10:49.260 align:start position:0%
this is no different than you submitting
 
01:10:50.810 --> 01:10:50.820 align:start position:0%
a zoning permit someone just sitting on
 
01:10:52.910 --> 01:10:52.920 align:start position:0%
it right and not acting on it right we
 
01:10:54.770 --> 01:10:54.780 align:start position:0%
put zoning permitting laws in place and
 
01:10:56.750 --> 01:10:56.760 align:start position:0%
we put timelines in place on zoning
 
01:10:58.610 --> 01:10:58.620 align:start position:0%
permits for that very reason is because
 
01:11:00.709 --> 01:11:00.719 align:start position:0%
you don't want municipalities or public
 
01:11:02.570 --> 01:11:02.580 align:start position:0%
entities just sitting and not acting and
 
01:11:05.450 --> 01:11:05.460 align:start position:0%
and not taking action so
 
01:11:07.070 --> 01:11:07.080 align:start position:0%
um that's why this that's what this is
 
01:11:11.209 --> 01:11:11.219 align:start position:0%
for so so just in terms of a possible
 
01:11:13.010 --> 01:11:13.020 align:start position:0%
coming to a place that that that
 
01:11:16.790 --> 01:11:16.800 align:start position:0%
addresses that that timeliness concern
 
01:11:23.030 --> 01:11:23.040 align:start position:0%
um if um if we were to go with with d uh
 
01:11:25.130 --> 01:11:25.140 align:start position:0%
including the within 60 days of
 
01:11:27.050 --> 01:11:27.060 align:start position:0%
receiving the offer engages substantial
 
01:11:28.990 --> 01:11:29.000 align:start position:0%
good faith negotiations for the purpose
 
01:11:31.370 --> 01:11:31.380 align:start position:0%
uh for the purchase or lease of the
 
01:11:33.350 --> 01:11:33.360 align:start position:0%
unused facility and then hard stuff
 
01:11:33.360 --> 01:11:35.510 align:start position:0%
unused facility and then hard stuff
there

01:11:35.510 --> 01:11:35.520 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:11:38.030 --> 01:11:38.040 align:start position:0%
that would certainly provide the um the
 
01:11:38.040 --> 01:11:42.370 align:start position:0%
that would certainly provide the um the
the timeline

01:11:42.370 --> 01:11:42.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:46.430 --> 01:11:46.440 align:start position:0%
so again the the problem isn't literally
 
01:11:48.410 --> 01:11:48.420 align:start position:0%
one of the conversations that came up in
 
01:11:50.870 --> 01:11:50.880 align:start position:0%
in the in the disposal of this property
 
01:11:52.910 --> 01:11:52.920 align:start position:0%
was why we want another school that's
 
01:11:56.270 --> 01:11:56.280 align:start position:0%
going to compete with us in our district
 
01:11:58.790 --> 01:11:58.800 align:start position:0%
so school work and knee-jerk react and
 
01:12:00.950 --> 01:12:00.960 align:start position:0%
say no regardless whether the offer was
 
01:12:02.450 --> 01:12:02.460 align:start position:0%
a fair market Price which would be in
 
01:12:05.330 --> 01:12:05.340 align:start position:0%
the best interest of the taxpayers but
 
01:12:07.250 --> 01:12:07.260 align:start position:0%
they could still say no right but why
 
01:12:08.990 --> 01:12:09.000 align:start position:0%
would they do that so the idea is that
 
01:12:10.430 --> 01:12:10.440 align:start position:0%
they entered into negotiations if they
 
01:12:12.350 --> 01:12:12.360 align:start position:0%
can't come to an agreement then you go
 
01:12:13.910 --> 01:12:13.920 align:start position:0%
get a fair market evaluation of the
 
01:12:15.050 --> 01:12:15.060 align:start position:0%
property and which is in the best
 
01:12:17.090 --> 01:12:17.100 align:start position:0%
interest of the taxpayer of the district
 
01:12:18.649 --> 01:12:18.659 align:start position:0%
not in the best interest maybe into the
 
01:12:20.570 --> 01:12:20.580 align:start position:0%
school but of the taxpayers the best
 
01:12:22.010 --> 01:12:22.020 align:start position:0%
interest to get the fair market value
 
01:12:24.290 --> 01:12:24.300 align:start position:0%
price of a given public piece of public
 
01:12:25.910 --> 01:12:25.920 align:start position:0%
property and sell it for that fair
 
01:12:30.229 --> 01:12:30.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:32.570 --> 01:12:32.580 align:start position:0%
um right I you know I think there's
 
01:12:36.229 --> 01:12:36.239 align:start position:0%
there's certainly statutes that that are
 
01:12:39.169 --> 01:12:39.179 align:start position:0%
on the books now with respect to to the
 
01:12:42.410 --> 01:12:42.420 align:start position:0%
the the sale of of public-owned publicly
 
01:12:44.450 --> 01:12:44.460 align:start position:0%
owned land and buildings
 
01:12:47.330 --> 01:12:47.340 align:start position:0%
um I I think it applies mostly to
 
01:12:50.209 --> 01:12:50.219 align:start position:0%
um municipalities and not so much um
 
01:12:52.130 --> 01:12:52.140 align:start position:0%
school districts but but at the same
 
01:12:54.830 --> 01:12:54.840 align:start position:0%
time I think school districts Who had
 
01:12:58.250 --> 01:12:58.260 align:start position:0%
who have that have made a decision to um
 
01:13:03.290 --> 01:13:03.300 align:start position:0%
to uh dispose of a a piece of property
 
01:13:05.270 --> 01:13:05.280 align:start position:0%
would likely be interested in doing that
 
01:13:06.590 --> 01:13:06.600 align:start position:0%
I mean I don't think there's a lot of
 
01:13:10.010 --> 01:13:10.020 align:start position:0%
school districts that that that you know
 
01:13:12.470 --> 01:13:12.480 align:start position:0%
that that want to see something like
 
01:13:16.010 --> 01:13:16.020 align:start position:0%
that sit so so just in the in the case
 
01:13:19.430 --> 01:13:19.440 align:start position:0%
of the the windswam uh situation it did
 
01:13:21.470 --> 01:13:21.480 align:start position:0%
resolve it took would you say nine
 
01:13:24.470 --> 01:13:24.480 align:start position:0%
months for it to resolve uh the language
 
01:13:27.830 --> 01:13:27.840 align:start position:0%
that you've got in the first part of D
 
01:13:31.130 --> 01:13:31.140 align:start position:0%
um brings that down to 60 days and uh
 
01:13:32.930 --> 01:13:32.940 align:start position:0%
and if they can't come to agreement it
 
01:13:35.330 --> 01:13:35.340 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean negotiation stop you know
 
01:13:38.390 --> 01:13:38.400 align:start position:0%
it could things could still happen but
 
01:13:40.250 --> 01:13:40.260 align:start position:0%
but I don't think having something in
 
01:13:42.350 --> 01:13:42.360 align:start position:0%
the law that um
 
01:13:46.070 --> 01:13:46.080 align:start position:0%
that that puts it in the hands of puts
 
01:13:48.950 --> 01:13:48.960 align:start position:0%
real estate transfer from a from a from
 
01:13:52.189 --> 01:13:52.199 align:start position:0%
a taxpayer owned public entity to a to a
 
01:13:54.050 --> 01:13:54.060 align:start position:0%
private entity putting that in the hands
 
01:13:55.970 --> 01:13:55.980 align:start position:0%
of the uh the commissioner of education
 
01:13:59.209 --> 01:13:59.219 align:start position:0%
is uh is anywhere close to the best
 
01:14:01.550 --> 01:14:01.560 align:start position:0%
interests of of taxpayers
 
01:14:04.610 --> 01:14:04.620 align:start position:0%
so again if I may Mr chair yes so again
 
01:14:06.530 --> 01:14:06.540 align:start position:0%
it doesn't put it in the hands of the
 
01:14:08.450 --> 01:14:08.460 align:start position:0%
taxpayer hands of the commission the
 
01:14:11.870 --> 01:14:11.880 align:start position:0%
commissioner just establishes a a real
 
01:14:13.250 --> 01:14:13.260 align:start position:0%
estate transaction like you would do if
 
01:14:14.930 --> 01:14:14.940 align:start position:0%
you're assemble your house to get comps
 
01:14:16.790 --> 01:14:16.800 align:start position:0%
you would go get what the fair market
 
01:14:19.130 --> 01:14:19.140 align:start position:0%
value of a house is is listed at from
 
01:14:20.990 --> 01:14:21.000 align:start position:0%
your realtor would look at comps in the
 
01:14:23.209 --> 01:14:23.219 align:start position:0%
area the idea behind here is that we'd
 
01:14:25.370 --> 01:14:25.380 align:start position:0%
have an impartial person doing an
 
01:14:26.870 --> 01:14:26.880 align:start position:0%
appraisal then finding out the fair
 
01:14:29.090 --> 01:14:29.100 align:start position:0%
market value and then offering that fair
 
01:14:30.770 --> 01:14:30.780 align:start position:0%
market value as the price of the charter
 
01:14:32.510 --> 01:14:32.520 align:start position:0%
school again which would be in the best
 
01:14:34.189 --> 01:14:34.199 align:start position:0%
interest of this taxpayer of the
 
01:14:34.199 --> 01:14:36.070 align:start position:0%
interest of this taxpayer of the
district

01:14:36.070 --> 01:14:36.080 align:start position:0%
district
 
01:14:40.910 --> 01:14:40.920 align:start position:0%
maybe so but not necessarily well the
 
01:14:43.189 --> 01:14:43.199 align:start position:0%
bill clearly states that you know if
 
01:14:45.110 --> 01:14:45.120 align:start position:0%
they aren't able to come to compromise
 
01:14:48.229 --> 01:14:48.239 align:start position:0%
Sarah is the commissioner engages a
 
01:14:50.330 --> 01:14:50.340 align:start position:0%
mediator so it's not putting in the
 
01:14:52.250 --> 01:14:52.260 align:start position:0%
hands of the commission or the he's
 
01:14:54.470 --> 01:14:54.480 align:start position:0%
handing it off to mediator X over here
 
01:14:57.169 --> 01:14:57.179 align:start position:0%
to resolve this issue as we do in
 
01:14:57.179 --> 01:14:58.669 align:start position:0%
to resolve this issue as we do in
negotiations

01:14:58.669 --> 01:14:58.679 align:start position:0%
negotiations
 
01:15:03.890 --> 01:15:03.900 align:start position:0%
right but but but it this you know the
 
01:15:07.430 --> 01:15:07.440 align:start position:0%
this this does bind the the taxpayers
 
01:15:10.510 --> 01:15:10.520 align:start position:0%
though and so if if the mediator who's
 
01:15:13.610 --> 01:15:13.620 align:start position:0%
who has been uh selected by the
 
01:15:15.590 --> 01:15:15.600 align:start position:0%
commissioner comes back and says you
 
01:15:16.669 --> 01:15:16.679 align:start position:0%
know what
 
01:15:18.770 --> 01:15:18.780 align:start position:0%
um uh we think fair market value for
 
01:15:20.930 --> 01:15:20.940 align:start position:0%
this property is a dollar
 
01:15:23.990 --> 01:15:24.000 align:start position:0%
um uh the taxpayers would be obligated
 
01:15:26.630 --> 01:15:26.640 align:start position:0%
then under this stat under this proposal
 
01:15:30.470 --> 01:15:30.480 align:start position:0%
to sell it to the um to the pro to a
 
01:15:33.290 --> 01:15:33.300 align:start position:0%
private entity for a dollar that's what
 
01:15:35.270 --> 01:15:35.280 align:start position:0%
this is saying and it reverse is true
 
01:15:36.410 --> 01:15:36.420 align:start position:0%
they could also come and say it's worth
 
01:15:40.250 --> 01:15:40.260 align:start position:0%
100 million dollars and so no no but the
 
01:15:42.229 --> 01:15:42.239 align:start position:0%
reverse isn't true because it does not
 
01:15:45.350 --> 01:15:45.360 align:start position:0%
compel the private organization to buy
 
01:15:49.010 --> 01:15:49.020 align:start position:0%
the private the the the decision this is
 
01:15:50.990 --> 01:15:51.000 align:start position:0%
very one-sided the private organization
 
01:15:54.229 --> 01:15:54.239 align:start position:0%
can accept or reject but the taxpayers
 
01:15:59.530 --> 01:15:59.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:03.229 --> 01:16:03.239 align:start position:0%
are you trying to speak or or represent
 
01:16:06.110 --> 01:16:06.120 align:start position:0%
dry well flip a coin represent paternal
 
01:16:08.390 --> 01:16:08.400 align:start position:0%
first and then represent Drive
 
01:16:10.310 --> 01:16:10.320 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
01:16:13.070 --> 01:16:13.080 align:start position:0%
um Senator Lang question for you during
 
01:16:15.229 --> 01:16:15.239 align:start position:0%
the nine months who was responsible for
 
01:16:16.729 --> 01:16:16.739 align:start position:0%
the maintenance and upkeep of that
 
01:16:18.709 --> 01:16:18.719 align:start position:0%
building was it the taxpayers the school
 
01:16:20.330 --> 01:16:20.340 align:start position:0%
district who was taking care of it
 
01:16:22.250 --> 01:16:22.260 align:start position:0%
according to our records of taxpayers
 
01:16:25.070 --> 01:16:25.080 align:start position:0%
end up paying 210 000 in maintenance and
 
01:16:26.510 --> 01:16:26.520 align:start position:0%
costs for that building while it was
 
01:16:27.950 --> 01:16:27.960 align:start position:0%
under it could have been sold and we
 
01:16:29.450 --> 01:16:29.460 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have had that expense but
 
01:16:30.890 --> 01:16:30.900 align:start position:0%
that's what it costs to maintain and
 
01:16:34.130 --> 01:16:34.140 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:37.250 --> 01:16:37.260 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman the idea of
 
01:16:40.310 --> 01:16:40.320 align:start position:0%
selling this property from a
 
01:16:43.970 --> 01:16:43.980 align:start position:0%
taxpayers to a 501c3 is already in the
 
01:16:46.010 --> 01:16:46.020 align:start position:0%
statute it's not a new idea all we're
 
01:16:47.570 --> 01:16:47.580 align:start position:0%
doing is putting the time limits on and
 
01:16:50.709 --> 01:16:50.719 align:start position:0%
if we go a little bit further in 194
 
01:16:54.350 --> 01:16:54.360 align:start position:0%
61 that the the
 
01:16:56.689 --> 01:16:56.699 align:start position:0%
Roman numeral five Charter School
 
01:16:59.810 --> 01:16:59.820 align:start position:0%
actually has a six months time limit put
 
01:17:01.550 --> 01:17:01.560 align:start position:0%
on it but the school does not have a
 
01:17:05.149 --> 01:17:05.159 align:start position:0%
time limit put on its side of it and uh
 
01:17:07.550 --> 01:17:07.560 align:start position:0%
and in Roman numeral four in the right
 
01:17:09.290 --> 01:17:09.300 align:start position:0%
of first refusal negotiations with the
 
01:17:10.910 --> 01:17:10.920 align:start position:0%
Charter Public School it should be the
 
01:17:12.410 --> 01:17:12.420 align:start position:0%
option of the offering School District
 
01:17:14.390 --> 01:17:14.400 align:start position:0%
whether to sell or lease the property
 
01:17:16.310 --> 01:17:16.320 align:start position:0%
under consideration at fair market value
 
01:17:19.130 --> 01:17:19.140 align:start position:0%
I think that that this just kind of
 
01:17:22.010 --> 01:17:22.020 align:start position:0%
equals the playing field do you agree
 
01:17:23.570 --> 01:17:23.580 align:start position:0%
Senator Lang
 
01:17:26.630 --> 01:17:26.640 align:start position:0%
I do again I think this is
 
01:17:29.570 --> 01:17:29.580 align:start position:0%
um you can't the school can't force a
 
01:17:32.270 --> 01:17:32.280 align:start position:0%
price on it on a charter school and make
 
01:17:33.590 --> 01:17:33.600 align:start position:0%
them take it because they may not be
 
01:17:34.970 --> 01:17:34.980 align:start position:0%
able to afford the price right so that's
 
01:17:35.810 --> 01:17:35.820 align:start position:0%
the reason you do the fair market
 
01:17:37.729 --> 01:17:37.739 align:start position:0%
evaluation and decide what the price is
 
01:17:38.930 --> 01:17:38.940 align:start position:0%
and then this charter school has to
 
01:17:40.189 --> 01:17:40.199 align:start position:0%
decide whether it can afford the
 
01:17:41.630 --> 01:17:41.640 align:start position:0%
mortgage or whatever the loan it's going
 
01:17:44.330 --> 01:17:44.340 align:start position:0%
to take to pay for that and if it can't
 
01:17:46.070 --> 01:17:46.080 align:start position:0%
then it turns down the offer and says
 
01:17:47.330 --> 01:17:47.340 align:start position:0%
thank you or they enter the negotiation
 
01:17:49.550 --> 01:17:49.560 align:start position:0%
say we can give it from you this and go
 
01:17:51.290 --> 01:17:51.300 align:start position:0%
into negotiations
 
01:17:52.850 --> 01:17:52.860 align:start position:0%
um then the it's up to the school
 
01:17:54.110 --> 01:17:54.120 align:start position:0%
district whether it wants to do it or
 
01:17:55.490 --> 01:17:55.500 align:start position:0%
not but the fair market Price has been
 
01:17:57.890 --> 01:17:57.900 align:start position:0%
set and so
 
01:18:00.110 --> 01:18:00.120 align:start position:0%
um again I think this does equal playing
 
01:18:01.970 --> 01:18:01.980 align:start position:0%
field and allows the school at the end
 
01:18:03.470 --> 01:18:03.480 align:start position:0%
who has to write the check every month
 
01:18:05.570 --> 01:18:05.580 align:start position:0%
for the cost of the school to make the
 
01:18:06.950 --> 01:18:06.960 align:start position:0%
decision on whether or not to buy it or
 
01:18:06.960 --> 01:18:09.070 align:start position:0%
decision on whether or not to buy it or
not

01:18:09.070 --> 01:18:09.080 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:18:11.570 --> 01:18:11.580 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair just one comment
 
01:18:16.030 --> 01:18:16.040 align:start position:0%
under RSA 194 colon 61 Roman numeral 4
 
01:18:18.530 --> 01:18:18.540 align:start position:0%
to complete what representative Drive
 
01:18:21.169 --> 01:18:21.179 align:start position:0%
was speaking about it says
 
01:18:23.930 --> 01:18:23.940 align:start position:0%
um the chartered Public's the offering
 
01:18:26.030 --> 01:18:26.040 align:start position:0%
School District whether has the option
 
01:18:27.830 --> 01:18:27.840 align:start position:0%
of selling or leasing the property under
 
01:18:31.070 --> 01:18:31.080 align:start position:0%
consideration at fair market value or
 
01:18:33.649 --> 01:18:33.659 align:start position:0%
less so selling a building for a dollar
 
01:18:39.709 --> 01:18:39.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:41.990 --> 01:18:42.000 align:start position:0%
again I I don't think that anything in
 
01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:43.250 align:start position:0%
again I I don't think that anything in
here

01:18:43.250 --> 01:18:43.260 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:18:43.260 --> 01:18:45.530 align:start position:0%
here
um

01:18:45.530 --> 01:18:45.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:47.510 --> 01:18:47.520 align:start position:0%
stops the school district from lowering
 
01:18:48.709 --> 01:18:48.719 align:start position:0%
the price if they wanted they get a fair
 
01:18:49.970 --> 01:18:49.980 align:start position:0%
if they go to a mediation they get a
 
01:18:51.590 --> 01:18:51.600 align:start position:0%
fair market value price and they go look
 
01:18:52.790 --> 01:18:52.800 align:start position:0%
we'll give it to you for five million
 
01:18:55.370 --> 01:18:55.380 align:start position:0%
dollars less million dollar lesser 100
 
01:18:57.410 --> 01:18:57.420 align:start position:0%
000 less Nothing Stops a school district
 
01:18:58.729 --> 01:18:58.739 align:start position:0%
from doing that with the charter school
 
01:19:00.530 --> 01:19:00.540 align:start position:0%
I want to remind it while we're making
 
01:19:03.229 --> 01:19:03.239 align:start position:0%
all these points about 501c whatever
 
01:19:05.630 --> 01:19:05.640 align:start position:0%
remember it's a public school transfer
 
01:19:07.430 --> 01:19:07.440 align:start position:0%
to a public school transfer public
 
01:19:09.890 --> 01:19:09.900 align:start position:0%
students attend that school
 
01:19:11.630 --> 01:19:11.640 align:start position:0%
let me just sharpen real quick sorry I'm
 
01:19:13.250 --> 01:19:13.260 align:start position:0%
going to say anything Sarah Lang and I
 
01:19:15.890 --> 01:19:15.900 align:start position:0%
have discussed this at length and I
 
01:19:16.970 --> 01:19:16.980 align:start position:0%
didn't really want to say anything but
 
01:19:19.370 --> 01:19:19.380 align:start position:0%
so my major issue with this amendment
 
01:19:21.169 --> 01:19:21.179 align:start position:0%
was pretty much the last sentence it
 
01:19:23.450 --> 01:19:23.460 align:start position:0%
says offering Charter Public School tour
 
01:19:26.810 --> 01:19:26.820 align:start position:0%
accept or reject it is giving that
 
01:19:30.050 --> 01:19:30.060 align:start position:0%
chartered school all the power in this
 
01:19:31.970 --> 01:19:31.980 align:start position:0%
negotiation I'm not sure another
 
01:19:31.980 --> 01:19:33.530 align:start position:0%
negotiation I'm not sure another
transaction

01:19:33.530 --> 01:19:33.540 align:start position:0%
transaction
 
01:19:35.810 --> 01:19:35.820 align:start position:0%
works like this any transaction in life
 
01:19:38.390 --> 01:19:38.400 align:start position:0%
works like this where the buyer gets to
 
01:19:40.370 --> 01:19:40.380 align:start position:0%
decide everything
 
01:19:42.350 --> 01:19:42.360 align:start position:0%
so they get to accept or reject the
 
01:19:44.090 --> 01:19:44.100 align:start position:0%
offer not that selling school gets to
 
01:19:45.470 --> 01:19:45.480 align:start position:0%
accept or reject the offer of that
 
01:19:47.870 --> 01:19:47.880 align:start position:0%
chartered Public School accepts or
 
01:19:52.669 --> 01:19:52.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:55.130 --> 01:19:55.140 align:start position:0%
who had their hand up first
 
01:19:59.930 --> 01:19:59.940 align:start position:0%
and Luna thanks Mr chair so um so how's
 
01:20:02.810 --> 01:20:02.820 align:start position:0%
this and I agree with what Senator
 
01:20:05.930 --> 01:20:05.940 align:start position:0%
Fenton just uh just said I mean if if we
 
01:20:08.810 --> 01:20:08.820 align:start position:0%
wanted to include language
 
01:20:10.729 --> 01:20:10.739 align:start position:0%
um and eliminate that that last part
 
01:20:13.550 --> 01:20:13.560 align:start position:0%
that puts all of the control in the
 
01:20:15.950 --> 01:20:15.960 align:start position:0%
charter you know we could probably
 
01:20:19.490 --> 01:20:19.500 align:start position:0%
probably live with that but but my
 
01:20:21.590 --> 01:20:21.600 align:start position:0%
question to you Mr chair in terms of the
 
01:20:24.290 --> 01:20:24.300 align:start position:0%
process here the the house position is
 
01:20:26.689 --> 01:20:26.699 align:start position:0%
the the bill without the amendment
 
01:20:28.430 --> 01:20:28.440 align:start position:0%
um the Senate position is the bill with
 
01:20:29.810 --> 01:20:29.820 align:start position:0%
the amendment
 
01:20:31.790 --> 01:20:31.800 align:start position:0%
um the common part of both those
 
01:20:35.030 --> 01:20:35.040 align:start position:0%
positions are the bill is introduced
 
01:20:38.149 --> 01:20:38.159 align:start position:0%
um and not the amendment is that a
 
01:20:40.669 --> 01:20:40.679 align:start position:0%
possibility here in terms of supporting
 
01:20:43.010 --> 01:20:43.020 align:start position:0%
the house position well there's always a
 
01:20:45.290 --> 01:20:45.300 align:start position:0%
possibility that you know the committee
 
01:20:46.790 --> 01:20:46.800 align:start position:0%
can come on say we support the house
 
01:20:51.410 --> 01:20:51.420 align:start position:0%
version or or or or or vice versa seed
 
01:20:53.689 --> 01:20:53.699 align:start position:0%
to the Senate version maybe even a seed
 
01:20:57.890 --> 01:20:57.900 align:start position:0%
as the maybe amended but uh yeah there's
 
01:21:01.490 --> 01:21:01.500 align:start position:0%
all there's possibilities however
 
01:21:01.500 --> 01:21:02.870 align:start position:0%
all there's possibilities however
um

01:21:02.870 --> 01:21:02.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:21:04.850 --> 01:21:04.860 align:start position:0%
but but I guess what I guess what my
 
01:21:05.990 --> 01:21:06.000 align:start position:0%
question is
 
01:21:10.189 --> 01:21:10.199 align:start position:0%
um as um as uh you know representative
 
01:21:13.790 --> 01:21:13.800 align:start position:0%
Myler uh is is likely to be removed from
 
01:21:15.649 --> 01:21:15.659 align:start position:0%
the last committee conference because of
 
01:21:17.390 --> 01:21:17.400 align:start position:0%
his inability to support the house
 
01:21:17.400 --> 01:21:18.890 align:start position:0%
his inability to support the house
position

01:21:18.890 --> 01:21:18.900 align:start position:0%
position
 
01:21:21.229 --> 01:21:21.239 align:start position:0%
um I'm supporting the house position and
 
01:21:23.209 --> 01:21:23.219 align:start position:0%
I want to make sure that I'm not going
 
01:21:25.970 --> 01:21:25.980 align:start position:0%
to be able to be replaced because I 100
 
01:21:28.310 --> 01:21:28.320 align:start position:0%
percent support the house position
 
01:21:29.990 --> 01:21:30.000 align:start position:0%
I think what we're looking at in the
 
01:21:32.090 --> 01:21:32.100 align:start position:0%
first bill with the the house would be a
 
01:21:35.709 --> 01:21:35.719 align:start position:0%
seating to the amendment amending the
 
01:21:37.729 --> 01:21:37.739 align:start position:0%
Senate version
 
01:21:39.649 --> 01:21:39.659 align:start position:0%
so right but I'm saying we weren't
 
01:21:42.370 --> 01:21:42.380 align:start position:0%
supporting the house version
 
01:21:44.630 --> 01:21:44.640 align:start position:0%
no no we weren't supporting in the first
 
01:21:48.890 --> 01:21:48.900 align:start position:0%
bill but but the the 275 the first bill
 
01:21:52.010 --> 01:21:52.020 align:start position:0%
was house is house position right now
 
01:21:55.370 --> 01:21:55.380 align:start position:0%
and and representative Myler could not
 
01:21:59.030 --> 01:21:59.040 align:start position:0%
support even of even a a minor change on
 
01:22:01.490 --> 01:22:01.500 align:start position:0%
that so he he would be removed from the
 
01:22:03.050 --> 01:22:03.060 align:start position:0%
committee for not being able to support
 
01:22:05.930 --> 01:22:05.940 align:start position:0%
the house position I'm saying what would
 
01:22:08.470 --> 01:22:08.480 align:start position:0%
happen in in this case where I'm 100
 
01:22:11.870 --> 01:22:11.880 align:start position:0%
supportive of the house position
 
01:22:14.149 --> 01:22:14.159 align:start position:0%
it we're not talking about that we're
 
01:22:15.950 --> 01:22:15.960 align:start position:0%
talking about the Senate version right
 
01:22:17.570 --> 01:22:17.580 align:start position:0%
now right it sounds to me like you're
 
01:22:20.450 --> 01:22:20.460 align:start position:0%
looking to be removed well I'm I'm what
 
01:22:23.030 --> 01:22:23.040 align:start position:0%
I'm what I'm interested in in doing is
 
01:22:25.550 --> 01:22:25.560 align:start position:0%
is is asking
 
01:22:28.669 --> 01:22:28.679 align:start position:0%
um um Senator Lang uh whether or not
 
01:22:32.390 --> 01:22:32.400 align:start position:0%
there's some common ground we can we can
 
01:22:34.729 --> 01:22:34.739 align:start position:0%
um we can come to and I think I think
 
01:22:37.370 --> 01:22:37.380 align:start position:0%
Senator Fenton laid out that Common
 
01:22:39.709 --> 01:22:39.719 align:start position:0%
Ground could probably be the bill is
 
01:22:41.570 --> 01:22:41.580 align:start position:0%
introduced plus the Senate Amendment
 
01:22:44.689 --> 01:22:44.699 align:start position:0%
right up to the last sentence and just
 
01:22:46.370 --> 01:22:46.380 align:start position:0%
you're saying taking out the portion of
 
01:22:48.709 --> 01:22:48.719 align:start position:0%
deals with leasing I'm saying taking out
 
01:22:54.530 --> 01:22:54.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:56.330 --> 01:22:56.340 align:start position:0%
because that last sentence deals with
 
01:22:58.450 --> 01:22:58.460 align:start position:0%
lease and that's how many years
 
01:23:01.610 --> 01:23:01.620 align:start position:0%
like in Washington DC it's the it's the
 
01:23:04.070 --> 01:23:04.080 align:start position:0%
taking out taking out the sentence that
 
01:23:07.250 --> 01:23:07.260 align:start position:0%
that um that puts the um the buying
 
01:23:09.530 --> 01:23:09.540 align:start position:0%
party in the position to accept or
 
01:23:12.350 --> 01:23:12.360 align:start position:0%
reject and the selling party which in
 
01:23:14.390 --> 01:23:14.400 align:start position:0%
this case is the taxpayers don't have
 
01:23:16.189 --> 01:23:16.199 align:start position:0%
any control over
 
01:23:18.350 --> 01:23:18.360 align:start position:0%
um uh you know
 
01:23:20.450 --> 01:23:20.460 align:start position:0%
or that if we were to eliminate that
 
01:23:22.550 --> 01:23:22.560 align:start position:0%
does that get us to a common I
 
01:23:24.890 --> 01:23:24.900 align:start position:0%
understand you're saying yeah Mr chair
 
01:23:27.830 --> 01:23:27.840 align:start position:0%
if I may yeah it just deals with
 
01:23:27.840 --> 01:23:28.370 align:start position:0%
if I may yeah it just deals with
um

01:23:28.370 --> 01:23:28.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:23:31.850 --> 01:23:31.860 align:start position:0%
the the verbiage saying uh for the
 
01:23:33.709 --> 01:23:33.719 align:start position:0%
offering chartered public school to
 
01:23:35.689 --> 01:23:35.699 align:start position:0%
agree to or reject
 
01:23:37.790 --> 01:23:37.800 align:start position:0%
so what we're looking at is the
 
01:23:39.290 --> 01:23:39.300 align:start position:0%
appraised values how to determine a fair
 
01:23:41.030 --> 01:23:41.040 align:start position:0%
market price for the offering Charter
 
01:23:43.310 --> 01:23:43.320 align:start position:0%
Public School get rid of to agree to or
 
01:23:46.010 --> 01:23:46.020 align:start position:0%
reject and in the last sentence again to
 
01:23:52.850 --> 01:23:52.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:54.410 --> 01:23:54.420 align:start position:0%
so I understand what representative luno
 
01:23:55.610 --> 01:23:55.620 align:start position:0%
saying I think Senator Lang and I have
 
01:23:57.169 --> 01:23:57.179 align:start position:0%
had this conversation as well would that
 
01:24:03.709 --> 01:24:03.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:04.970 --> 01:24:04.980 align:start position:0%
could we take a break for a couple
 
01:24:08.930 --> 01:24:08.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:11.090 --> 01:24:11.100 align:start position:0%
are we doing house senate break we're
 
01:24:13.729 --> 01:24:13.739 align:start position:0%
taking a break for the the we need to
 
01:24:16.390 --> 01:24:16.400 align:start position:0%
think through this yeah okay
 
01:24:19.010 --> 01:24:19.020 align:start position:0%
okay yeah
 
01:41:29.689 --> 01:41:29.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:32.149 --> 01:41:32.159 align:start position:0%
okay we'd like to go ahead here and
 
01:41:35.450 --> 01:41:35.460 align:start position:0%
continue with uh uh the Community
 
01:41:37.490 --> 01:41:37.500 align:start position:0%
Conference on this bill
 
01:41:37.500 --> 01:41:38.390 align:start position:0%
Conference on this bill
um

01:41:38.390 --> 01:41:38.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:41:40.850 --> 01:41:40.860 align:start position:0%
appears that we
 
01:41:43.790 --> 01:41:43.800 align:start position:0%
on the house side we're good with taking
 
01:41:45.890 --> 01:41:45.900 align:start position:0%
out the words on the fourth line from
 
01:41:48.590 --> 01:41:48.600 align:start position:0%
the bottom to agree or reject and the
 
01:41:51.950 --> 01:41:51.960 align:start position:0%
bottom line to accept or reject and to
 
01:41:55.609 --> 01:41:55.619 align:start position:0%
make Amendment with those out
 
01:41:59.270 --> 01:41:59.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:05.270 --> 01:42:05.280 align:start position:0%
good so so what what uh the you know so
 
01:42:08.149 --> 01:42:08.159 align:start position:0%
we will then take a vote first of the to
 
01:42:11.570 --> 01:42:11.580 align:start position:0%
a seed to the Senate version as amended
 
01:42:13.669 --> 01:42:13.679 align:start position:0%
by the committee here to take out those
 
01:42:16.490 --> 01:42:16.500 align:start position:0%
words I just mentioned
 
01:42:20.570 --> 01:42:20.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:22.669 --> 01:42:22.679 align:start position:0%
object so I already asked this question
 
01:42:23.990 --> 01:42:24.000 align:start position:0%
again whether we needed a piece of paper
 
01:42:25.490 --> 01:42:25.500 align:start position:0%
in front of us with the actual amendment
 
01:42:27.649 --> 01:42:27.659 align:start position:0%
number and she said no no so if it's a
 
01:42:29.390 --> 01:42:29.400 align:start position:0%
simple Amendment like striking these
 
01:42:32.149 --> 01:42:32.159 align:start position:0%
five words in two locations we can agree
 
01:42:33.770 --> 01:42:33.780 align:start position:0%
to that we can vote on that and the
 
01:42:35.750 --> 01:42:35.760 align:start position:0%
committee report will be drafted in such
 
01:42:39.109 --> 01:42:39.119 align:start position:0%
a way that'll reflect it yeah
 
01:42:42.169 --> 01:42:42.179 align:start position:0%
so we'll take a vote from on on the
 
01:42:45.530 --> 01:42:45.540 align:start position:0%
outside first separate from
 
01:42:48.590 --> 01:42:48.600 align:start position:0%
so I'd like to see a raise of hands for
 
01:42:51.649 --> 01:42:51.659 align:start position:0%
those that are in support of the uh
 
01:42:53.689 --> 01:42:53.699 align:start position:0%
change that we just allude to take out
 
01:42:56.870 --> 01:42:56.880 align:start position:0%
the words to agree to or reject online
 
01:42:58.609 --> 01:42:58.619 align:start position:0%
fourth line up
 
01:43:01.010 --> 01:43:01.020 align:start position:0%
to accept or reject on the bottom line
 
01:43:04.669 --> 01:43:04.679 align:start position:0%
out also all those in favor
 
01:43:08.629 --> 01:43:08.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:11.510 --> 01:43:11.520 align:start position:0%

our recommendation and the
 
01:53:39.410 --> 01:53:39.420 align:start position:0%
recommendation is to
 
01:53:39.420 --> 01:53:41.209 align:start position:0%
recommendation is to
concur

01:53:41.209 --> 01:53:41.219 align:start position:0%
concur
 
01:53:46.070 --> 01:53:46.080 align:start position:0%
with the Senate version as amended
 
01:53:46.080 --> 01:53:47.570 align:start position:0%
with the Senate version as amended
and

01:53:47.570 --> 01:53:47.580 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:53:50.510 --> 01:53:50.520 align:start position:0%
or no we're going to concur with the
 
01:53:50.520 --> 01:53:51.709 align:start position:0%
or no we're going to concur with the
amendment

01:53:51.709 --> 01:53:51.719 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
01:53:53.990 --> 01:53:54.000 align:start position:0%
so the amendment Mr chair I may the
 
01:53:56.030 --> 01:53:56.040 align:start position:0%
amendment is if you're looking at the
 
01:53:58.550 --> 01:53:58.560 align:start position:0%
bill on line 15 we're going to strike
 
01:54:00.590 --> 01:54:00.600 align:start position:0%
the words complying with the provisions
 
01:54:05.330 --> 01:54:05.340 align:start position:0%
of RSA 194 colon 23-e whatever that's
 
01:54:07.490 --> 01:54:07.500 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm going to strike those words out
 
01:54:09.229 --> 01:54:09.239 align:start position:0%
and leave the rest of the bill as is
 
01:54:11.270 --> 01:54:11.280 align:start position:0%
that would be the proposed amendment and
 
01:54:13.490 --> 01:54:13.500 align:start position:0%
and we did have an amendment on the
 
01:54:16.990 --> 01:54:17.000 align:start position:0%
table in front of us which was 2192h
 
01:54:20.390 --> 01:54:20.400 align:start position:0%
yeah and if we look at line 15 we're
 
01:54:22.070 --> 01:54:22.080 align:start position:0%
taking everything between the words
 
01:54:25.729 --> 01:54:25.739 align:start position:0%
applying and the RSA reference numbers
 
01:54:25.739 --> 01:54:26.810 align:start position:0%
applying and the RSA reference numbers
out

01:54:26.810 --> 01:54:26.820 align:start position:0%
out
 
01:54:29.570 --> 01:54:29.580 align:start position:0%
so it'll read is a public school or
 
01:54:34.490 --> 01:54:34.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:39.290 --> 01:54:39.300 align:start position:0%
okay so from the house side
 
01:54:42.649 --> 01:54:42.659 align:start position:0%
all those in favor of language that I
 
01:54:43.910 --> 01:54:43.920 align:start position:0%
just read
 
01:54:47.689 --> 01:54:47.699 align:start position:0%
say I I said inside
 
01:54:50.629 --> 01:54:50.639 align:start position:0%
so we have concurrence now on the
 
01:54:52.430 --> 01:54:52.440 align:start position:0%
amending language
 
01:54:56.270 --> 01:54:56.280 align:start position:0%
so we are amending the acceding to the
 
01:54:59.750 --> 01:54:59.760 align:start position:0%
kind of version with this amending
 
01:54:59.760 --> 01:55:01.609 align:start position:0%
kind of version with this amending
language

01:55:01.609 --> 01:55:01.619 align:start position:0%
language
 
01:55:09.100 --> 01:55:09.110 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:09.110 --> 06:01:36.530 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

06:01:36.530 --> 06:01:36.540 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:01.930 --> 06:02:01.940 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:04.190 --> 06:02:04.200 align:start position:0%
thank you very much this is the
 
06:02:05.868 --> 06:02:05.878 align:start position:0%
committee of conference on House Bill
 
06:02:09.048 --> 06:02:09.058 align:start position:0%
610 and I thank you all for being here
 
06:02:11.750 --> 06:02:11.760 align:start position:0%
um this is was originally a bill passed
 
06:02:13.010 --> 06:02:13.020 align:start position:0%
by the house in order to prevent
 
06:02:14.868 --> 06:02:14.878 align:start position:0%
discrimination against different types
 
06:02:16.310 --> 06:02:16.320 align:start position:0%
of providers for the therapeutic
 
06:02:18.590 --> 06:02:18.600 align:start position:0%
cannabis program when it was initially
 
06:02:18.600 --> 06:02:19.548 align:start position:0%
cannabis program when it was initially
written

06:02:19.548 --> 06:02:19.558 align:start position:0%
written
 
06:02:20.690 --> 06:02:20.700 align:start position:0%
um there was I believe there was the
 
06:02:22.368 --> 06:02:22.378 align:start position:0%
understanding that if you included
 
06:02:25.490 --> 06:02:25.500 align:start position:0%
Physicians advanced practice nurses and
 
06:02:27.590 --> 06:02:27.600 align:start position:0%
Physicians with assistance you covered
 
06:02:29.448 --> 06:02:29.458 align:start position:0%
all of the providers in the state that
 
06:02:31.250 --> 06:02:31.260 align:start position:0%
are able to prescribe controlled
 
06:02:33.530 --> 06:02:33.540 align:start position:0%
substances in the state unfortunately we
 
06:02:34.670 --> 06:02:34.680 align:start position:0%
have four different professions
 
06:02:37.270 --> 06:02:37.280 align:start position:0%
podiatrists dentists
 
06:02:40.010 --> 06:02:40.020 align:start position:0%
naturopaths and optometrists who are not
 
06:02:41.690 --> 06:02:41.700 align:start position:0%
included in those statutes but do
 
06:02:44.510 --> 06:02:44.520 align:start position:0%
prescribe controlled drugs the original
 
06:02:47.510 --> 06:02:47.520 align:start position:0%
bill in section one would allow any
 
06:02:50.030 --> 06:02:50.040 align:start position:0%
Doctor Who anybody in the state who is
 
06:02:52.368 --> 06:02:52.378 align:start position:0%
allowed to prescribe drugs to humans and
 
06:02:54.708 --> 06:02:54.718 align:start position:0%
is approved through the DEA prescribing
 
06:02:56.030 --> 06:02:56.040 align:start position:0%
process in order to write the
 
06:02:58.490 --> 06:02:58.500 align:start position:0%
certification for cannabis uh the reason
 
06:03:00.530 --> 06:03:00.540 align:start position:0%
this is important we have 89 patients
 
06:03:03.230 --> 06:03:03.240 align:start position:0%
with glaucoma on the program glaucoma
 
06:03:05.208 --> 06:03:05.218 align:start position:0%
with elevated intraocular pressure that
 
06:03:07.368 --> 06:03:07.378 align:start position:0%
leads to losing your vision and cannabis
 
06:03:09.770 --> 06:03:09.780 align:start position:0%
is something that does address that not
 
06:03:11.448 --> 06:03:11.458 align:start position:0%
one of those patients was certified by
 
06:03:13.070 --> 06:03:13.080 align:start position:0%
their optometrist they had to go to
 
06:03:14.270 --> 06:03:14.280 align:start position:0%
another provider because the
 
06:03:16.788 --> 06:03:16.798 align:start position:0%
optometrists were not allowed in section
 
06:03:18.610 --> 06:03:18.620 align:start position:0%
two there's another issue as well
 
06:03:20.810 --> 06:03:20.820 align:start position:0%
there's generally the idea that all kids
 
06:03:22.850 --> 06:03:22.860 align:start position:0%
see a pediatrician but we have a
 
06:03:24.890 --> 06:03:24.900 align:start position:0%
shortage of Pediatricians we have some
 
06:03:26.570 --> 06:03:26.580 align:start position:0%
kids who are going to Family Practice
 
06:03:29.750 --> 06:03:29.760 align:start position:0%
providers who specialize in Pediatrics
 
06:03:31.970 --> 06:03:31.980 align:start position:0%
but they are not pediatricians there are
 
06:03:33.350 --> 06:03:33.360 align:start position:0%
also some kids that are so medically
 
06:03:36.288 --> 06:03:36.298 align:start position:0%
complex that their pediatric doctors a
 
06:03:38.150 --> 06:03:38.160 align:start position:0%
pediatric oncologist because frankly
 
06:03:39.110 --> 06:03:39.120 align:start position:0%
they're trying to see their next
 
06:03:41.570 --> 06:03:41.580 align:start position:0%
birthday the idea of requiring a
 
06:03:44.270 --> 06:03:44.280 align:start position:0%
pediatrician when they sing another
 
06:03:46.430 --> 06:03:46.440 align:start position:0%
specialist who already specializes in
 
06:03:48.708 --> 06:03:48.718 align:start position:0%
Pediatrics doesn't really make much
 
06:03:52.010 --> 06:03:52.020 align:start position:0%
sense in the practice and because this
 
06:03:53.930 --> 06:03:53.940 align:start position:0%
is one of the areas where in our roles
 
06:03:56.030 --> 06:03:56.040 align:start position:0%
and in our laws it says pediatrician but
 
06:03:58.070 --> 06:03:58.080 align:start position:0%
but it's it's one of those areas where
 
06:04:00.470 --> 06:04:00.480 align:start position:0%
we need to try and address this
 
06:04:02.930 --> 06:04:02.940 align:start position:0%
um this bill then also had two in the
 
06:04:05.090 --> 06:04:05.100 align:start position:0%
senate had two bail reform bills added
 
06:04:07.548 --> 06:04:07.558 align:start position:0%
on to it one which is uh similar to
 
06:04:09.250 --> 06:04:09.260 align:start position:0%
what's being seen in criminal justice
 
06:04:11.990 --> 06:04:12.000 align:start position:0%
and uh that's section three and then
 
06:04:13.910 --> 06:04:13.920 align:start position:0%
section four was an appropriation that
 
06:04:15.890 --> 06:04:15.900 align:start position:0%
was not seen in criminal justice had
 
06:04:18.170 --> 06:04:18.180 align:start position:0%
been put into the budget but um was in
 
06:04:19.670 --> 06:04:19.680 align:start position:0%
talks to be in the budget I don't know
 
06:04:21.770 --> 06:04:21.780 align:start position:0%
that entire process on the budget for
 
06:04:23.628 --> 06:04:23.638 align:start position:0%
the million dollar appropriation for
 
06:04:26.150 --> 06:04:26.160 align:start position:0%
electronic bail but right now it's all
 
06:04:28.070 --> 06:04:28.080 align:start position:0%
on paper so if you're arrested in one
 
06:04:29.750 --> 06:04:29.760 align:start position:0%
part of the state nobody knows unless
 
06:04:31.310 --> 06:04:31.320 align:start position:0%
they know to call
 
06:04:33.110 --> 06:04:33.120 align:start position:0%
um unless they know to call Chad Chester
 
06:04:35.030 --> 06:04:35.040 align:start position:0%
because you were arrested there so it's
 
06:04:36.770 --> 06:04:36.780 align:start position:0%
trying to address one of those flaws in
 
06:04:40.430 --> 06:04:40.440 align:start position:0%
the program then finally sections five
 
06:04:42.110 --> 06:04:42.120 align:start position:0%
and six
 
06:04:43.850 --> 06:04:43.860 align:start position:0%
um are came from a different Senate Bill
 
06:04:46.730 --> 06:04:46.740 align:start position:0%
180 the first section basically codifies
 
06:04:49.310 --> 06:04:49.320 align:start position:0%
what's already happening with having the
 
06:04:50.930 --> 06:04:50.940 align:start position:0%
oversight boards look at the labeling
 
06:04:53.150 --> 06:04:53.160 align:start position:0%
and educational materials it's good to
 
06:04:55.128 --> 06:04:55.138 align:start position:0%
be able to codify that the other is
 
06:04:56.930 --> 06:04:56.940 align:start position:0%
addressing the hemp derived products
 
06:04:59.690 --> 06:04:59.700 align:start position:0%
these come out of the 2018 Farm Bill
 
06:05:02.090 --> 06:05:02.100 align:start position:0%
Bill wear hemp products under a certain
 
06:05:05.390 --> 06:05:05.400 align:start position:0%
concentration of THC Delta 9 were made
 
06:05:07.490 --> 06:05:07.500 align:start position:0%
legal because we need to have as an
 
06:05:09.110 --> 06:05:09.120 align:start position:0%
industrial product that's what brought
 
06:05:12.410 --> 06:05:12.420 align:start position:0%
CBD those two sections five and six are
 
06:05:14.150 --> 06:05:14.160 align:start position:0%
also were also attached on House Bill
 
06:05:17.208 --> 06:05:17.218 align:start position:0%
611 that bill is going to is calling to
 
06:05:18.410 --> 06:05:18.420 align:start position:0%
a committee of conference Wednesday
 
06:05:21.048 --> 06:05:21.058 align:start position:0%
morning and I think that that is a more
 
06:05:22.910 --> 06:05:22.920 align:start position:0%
comprehensive look at all of cannabis
 
06:05:24.890 --> 06:05:24.900 align:start position:0%
and looking at a council for cannabis
 
06:05:27.350 --> 06:05:27.360 align:start position:0%
legalization so I believe that it'll be
 
06:05:28.850 --> 06:05:28.860 align:start position:0%
a lot more appropriate to deal with
 
06:05:30.650 --> 06:05:30.660 align:start position:0%
sections five and six in the committee
 
06:05:33.410 --> 06:05:33.420 align:start position:0%
of conference for 611 and so I would
 
06:05:35.090 --> 06:05:35.100 align:start position:0%
argue that we look to just strike that
 
06:05:36.948 --> 06:05:36.958 align:start position:0%
today so that we can deal with that in
 
06:05:39.650 --> 06:05:39.660 align:start position:0%
the more appropriate vehicle for Senate
 
06:05:42.830 --> 06:05:42.840 align:start position:0%
bill for sections five and six
 
06:05:44.930 --> 06:05:44.940 align:start position:0%
I guess my first question would be if
 
06:05:46.610 --> 06:05:46.620 align:start position:0%
there's any concerns that people have
 
06:05:48.890 --> 06:05:48.900 align:start position:0%
with the first two sections on the
 
06:05:50.750 --> 06:05:50.760 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis program to prevent
 
06:05:53.030 --> 06:05:53.040 align:start position:0%
that provider discrimination and to
 
06:05:55.730 --> 06:05:55.740 align:start position:0%
allow kids to be certified by the
 
06:05:58.070 --> 06:05:58.080 align:start position:0%
Pediatric Specialists that they normally
 
06:05:58.080 --> 06:06:01.310 align:start position:0%
Pediatric Specialists that they normally
see

06:06:01.310 --> 06:06:01.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:04.010 --> 06:06:04.020 align:start position:0%
so I know that that language is similar
 
06:06:06.048 --> 06:06:06.058 align:start position:0%
in the house and the Senate versions
 
06:06:08.030 --> 06:06:08.040 align:start position:0%
um thank you yes um representative Weber
 
06:06:09.350 --> 06:06:09.360 align:start position:0%
said the language is similar it's
 
06:06:10.970 --> 06:06:10.980 align:start position:0%
actually the exact same language in the
 
06:06:12.948 --> 06:06:12.958 align:start position:0%
House and Senate it passed our committee
 
06:06:15.708 --> 06:06:15.718 align:start position:0%
20-0 and it passed on consent
 
06:06:17.628 --> 06:06:17.638 align:start position:0%
so that that section
 
06:06:19.670 --> 06:06:19.680 align:start position:0%
um should not be I I don't see any
 
06:06:21.110 --> 06:06:21.120 align:start position:0%
objections to that part so that's good
 
06:06:22.070 --> 06:06:22.080 align:start position:0%
to see
 
06:06:23.570 --> 06:06:23.580 align:start position:0%
um or would there be any objections to
 
06:06:25.788 --> 06:06:25.798 align:start position:0%
moving sections five and six to House
 
06:06:27.770 --> 06:06:27.780 align:start position:0%
Bill 611 and therefore striking what
 
06:06:29.690 --> 06:06:29.700 align:start position:0%
we're doing today striking those from
 
06:06:29.700 --> 06:06:30.530 align:start position:0%
we're doing today striking those from
today

06:06:30.530 --> 06:06:30.540 align:start position:0%
today
 
06:06:34.490 --> 06:06:34.500 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:34.500 --> 06:06:37.070 align:start position:0%
 
um

06:06:37.070 --> 06:06:37.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:38.448 --> 06:06:38.458 align:start position:0%
first of all
 
06:06:38.458 --> 06:06:39.288 align:start position:0%
first of all
um

06:06:39.288 --> 06:06:39.298 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:06:42.048 --> 06:06:42.058 align:start position:0%
former representative Canuck contacted
 
06:06:43.548 --> 06:06:43.558 align:start position:0%
me over the weekend
 
06:06:46.368 --> 06:06:46.378 align:start position:0%
there is a
 
06:06:46.378 --> 06:06:48.410 align:start position:0%
there is a
um

06:06:48.410 --> 06:06:48.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:06:50.628 --> 06:06:50.638 align:start position:0%
RSA change that should be made
 
06:06:50.638 --> 06:06:53.270 align:start position:0%
RSA change that should be made
apparently

06:06:53.270 --> 06:06:53.280 align:start position:0%
apparently
 
06:06:56.270 --> 06:06:56.280 align:start position:0%
um oh yes he testified to that in front
 
06:06:57.948 --> 06:06:57.958 align:start position:0%
of the Senate but inadvertently it
 
06:07:00.770 --> 06:07:00.780 align:start position:0%
didn't happen it should be in section 2
 
06:07:07.250 --> 06:07:07.260 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:09.590 --> 06:07:09.600 align:start position:0%
and it first came to verse that could be
 
06:07:12.170 --> 06:07:12.180 align:start position:0%
made as a non-rollability because it's
 
06:07:14.390 --> 06:07:14.400 align:start position:0%
just directing the reference but if we
 
06:07:15.830 --> 06:07:15.840 align:start position:0%
can get in there now that would be
 
06:07:17.510 --> 06:07:17.520 align:start position:0%
better yes I think that'd be a good idea
 
06:07:19.010 --> 06:07:19.020 align:start position:0%
to correct now if we're able to come to
 
06:07:20.570 --> 06:07:20.580 align:start position:0%
an agreement so thank you for that
 
06:07:20.580 --> 06:07:23.750 align:start position:0%
an agreement so thank you for that
senator

06:07:23.750 --> 06:07:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:23.760 --> 06:07:31.868 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

06:07:31.868 --> 06:07:31.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:35.750 --> 06:07:35.760 align:start position:0%
so now we have the two sections on the
 
06:07:38.750 --> 06:07:38.760 align:start position:0%
bail reform we have section three
 
06:07:41.570 --> 06:07:41.580 align:start position:0%
um and that is an area where we have a
 
06:07:43.070 --> 06:07:43.080 align:start position:0%
chairman Roy at the criminal justice
 
06:07:45.110 --> 06:07:45.120 align:start position:0%
committee who has been dealing with bail
 
06:07:46.730 --> 06:07:46.740 align:start position:0%
reform and I'm not sure if you could
 
06:07:48.048 --> 06:07:48.058 align:start position:0%
give us a little bit more about the
 
06:07:50.390 --> 06:07:50.400 align:start position:0%
house position on the bail reform on
 
06:07:55.368 --> 06:07:55.378 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:57.910 --> 06:07:57.920 align:start position:0%
thank you so
 
06:08:00.708 --> 06:08:00.718 align:start position:0%
as far as the the house position
 
06:08:03.708 --> 06:08:03.718 align:start position:0%
regarding section three
 
06:08:07.128 --> 06:08:07.138 align:start position:0%
which is the um hold on a second that's
 
06:08:09.470 --> 06:08:09.480 align:start position:0%
the portion regarding people held for
 
06:08:11.690 --> 06:08:11.700 align:start position:0%
certain offenses
 
06:08:15.350 --> 06:08:15.360 align:start position:0%
um the house the committee retained all
 
06:08:17.448 --> 06:08:17.458 align:start position:0%
the bail bills from the house and the
 
06:08:19.910 --> 06:08:19.920 align:start position:0%
Senate this year to come up with a
 
06:08:23.448 --> 06:08:23.458 align:start position:0%
comprehensive bill that addressed all
 
06:08:27.470 --> 06:08:27.480 align:start position:0%
the issues and there are many and the
 
06:08:29.628 --> 06:08:29.638 align:start position:0%
first issue that was important actually
 
06:08:32.090 --> 06:08:32.100 align:start position:0%
addresses section four which would be
 
06:08:33.590 --> 06:08:33.600 align:start position:0%
the the million dollar appropriation
 
06:08:36.170 --> 06:08:36.180 align:start position:0%
because all the other ones are
 
06:08:39.288 --> 06:08:39.298 align:start position:0%
somewhat negatory because of the fact
 
06:08:44.030 --> 06:08:44.040 align:start position:0%
that even if someone's held for a a
 
06:08:47.330 --> 06:08:47.340 align:start position:0%
felony a violent felony to see the judge
 
06:08:49.610 --> 06:08:49.620 align:start position:0%
on Monday that person could still be out
 
06:08:51.410 --> 06:08:51.420 align:start position:0%
on bail from another jurisdiction and
 
06:08:53.990 --> 06:08:54.000 align:start position:0%
that judge would not know there's no
 
06:08:56.150 --> 06:08:56.160 align:start position:0%
system in this state currently for
 
06:08:59.448 --> 06:08:59.458 align:start position:0%
judges or for police officers or for
 
06:09:02.330 --> 06:09:02.340 align:start position:0%
bail Commissioners to know who is on
 
06:09:04.368 --> 06:09:04.378 align:start position:0%
bail until the paperwork from the first
 
06:09:06.650 --> 06:09:06.660 align:start position:0%
arrest gets back to the court
 
06:09:06.660 --> 06:09:08.330 align:start position:0%
arrest gets back to the court
so

06:09:08.330 --> 06:09:08.340 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:09:11.330 --> 06:09:11.340 align:start position:0%
we realize and that's I discovered that
 
06:09:12.708 --> 06:09:12.718 align:start position:0%
by starting to look into all these bail
 
06:09:14.208 --> 06:09:14.218 align:start position:0%
bills to get to the bottom of what the
 
06:09:17.030 --> 06:09:17.040 align:start position:0%
real problem is based on the the makeup
 
06:09:21.070 --> 06:09:21.080 align:start position:0%
of the house everything we do out of
 
06:09:23.448 --> 06:09:23.458 align:start position:0%
necessity and deference to the message
 
06:09:25.670 --> 06:09:25.680 align:start position:0%
we got from our voters is work together
 
06:09:28.190 --> 06:09:28.200 align:start position:0%
in a bipartisan fashion to come up with
 
06:09:29.990 --> 06:09:30.000 align:start position:0%
a solution
 
06:09:32.090 --> 06:09:32.100 align:start position:0%
um and that's and that's where we are
 
06:09:34.070 --> 06:09:34.080 align:start position:0%
and why we decided to retain them all
 
06:09:36.590 --> 06:09:36.600 align:start position:0%
and work on them together both sides of
 
06:09:37.970 --> 06:09:37.980 align:start position:0%
the aisle over the summer to come up
 
06:09:39.948 --> 06:09:39.958 align:start position:0%
with a piece of legislation that would
 
06:09:41.810 --> 06:09:41.820 align:start position:0%
be taken up first thing in the fall
 
06:09:44.990 --> 06:09:45.000 align:start position:0%
that would address all these issues so
 
06:09:47.708 --> 06:09:47.718 align:start position:0%
that's where we're at
 
06:09:50.510 --> 06:09:50.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:09:55.850 --> 06:09:55.860 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:01.128 --> 06:10:01.138 align:start position:0%
I think only that that I uh I would say
 
06:10:04.128 --> 06:10:04.138 align:start position:0%
that the both of the I realized that one
 
06:10:05.810 --> 06:10:05.820 align:start position:0%
of the bill Provisions may be simpler
 
06:10:09.110 --> 06:10:09.120 align:start position:0%
than the other but uh what I have heard
 
06:10:11.208 --> 06:10:11.218 align:start position:0%
from people I've been speaking to is
 
06:10:13.070 --> 06:10:13.080 align:start position:0%
that they very much want to keep
 
06:10:15.650 --> 06:10:15.660 align:start position:0%
everything as a package so that it's all
 
06:10:18.890 --> 06:10:18.900 align:start position:0%
on the table one very uh cohesive
 
06:10:21.350 --> 06:10:21.360 align:start position:0%
package can be brought out and it
 
06:10:23.448 --> 06:10:23.458 align:start position:0%
certainly sounded to me like there was a
 
06:10:25.548 --> 06:10:25.558 align:start position:0%
very firm commitment to spend the time
 
06:10:28.430 --> 06:10:28.440 align:start position:0%
that was needed and here's my thinking
 
06:10:30.830 --> 06:10:30.840 align:start position:0%
on that it's something that really
 
06:10:34.750 --> 06:10:34.760 align:start position:0%
requires the input of the stakeholders
 
06:10:38.750 --> 06:10:38.760 align:start position:0%
of which there are many many with very
 
06:10:41.868 --> 06:10:41.878 align:start position:0%
differing points of view so I would like
 
06:10:44.390 --> 06:10:44.400 align:start position:0%
to see it all worked on in public in a
 
06:10:47.330 --> 06:10:47.340 align:start position:0%
in a proper work session subcommittee
 
06:10:49.570 --> 06:10:49.580 align:start position:0%
session so that it can be
 
06:10:58.548 --> 06:10:58.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:00.230 --> 06:11:00.240 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:11:02.030 --> 06:11:02.040 align:start position:0%
um Madam chair
 
06:11:04.430 --> 06:11:04.440 align:start position:0%
this issue has been worked on for a
 
06:11:05.890 --> 06:11:05.900 align:start position:0%
number of years now
 
06:11:09.530 --> 06:11:09.540 align:start position:0%
I can sit here and I can tell you that
 
06:11:12.230 --> 06:11:12.240 align:start position:0%
when this issue was brought
 
06:11:14.090 --> 06:11:14.100 align:start position:0%
through the Senate
 
06:11:16.128 --> 06:11:16.138 align:start position:0%
there was a lot of misrepresentation
 
06:11:18.890 --> 06:11:18.900 align:start position:0%
about what this program was going to
 
06:11:22.730 --> 06:11:22.740 align:start position:0%
look at and within months and I don't
 
06:11:24.708 --> 06:11:24.718 align:start position:0%
mean five or six months I mean within
 
06:11:27.350 --> 06:11:27.360 align:start position:0%
two to three months we started hearing
 
06:11:29.448 --> 06:11:29.458 align:start position:0%
back from the stakeholder so people that
 
06:11:32.090 --> 06:11:32.100 align:start position:0%
are directly affected by this our law
 
06:11:34.670 --> 06:11:34.680 align:start position:0%
enforcement especially about the failure
 
06:11:38.150 --> 06:11:38.160 align:start position:0%
of this program and we have tried over
 
06:11:41.570 --> 06:11:41.580 align:start position:0%
and over and over again to reach a
 
06:11:41.580 --> 06:11:42.770 align:start position:0%
and over and over again to reach a
solution

06:11:42.770 --> 06:11:42.780 align:start position:0%
solution
 
06:11:45.530 --> 06:11:45.540 align:start position:0%
and every time there's always another
 
06:11:47.868 --> 06:11:47.878 align:start position:0%
problem another problem another problem
 
06:11:50.030 --> 06:11:50.040 align:start position:0%
we have tried
 
06:11:53.030 --> 06:11:53.040 align:start position:0%
this bail reform that's here came out of
 
06:11:53.990 --> 06:11:54.000 align:start position:0%
the Senate
 
06:11:57.128 --> 06:11:57.138 align:start position:0%
I think it was 20 21-3
 
06:11:59.930 --> 06:11:59.940 align:start position:0%
bipartisan because as the representative
 
06:12:02.868 --> 06:12:02.878 align:start position:0%
said we've heard from the people to work
 
06:12:08.750 --> 06:12:08.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:11.990 --> 06:12:12.000 align:start position:0%
I don't know what else you can do here
 
06:12:15.530 --> 06:12:15.540 align:start position:0%
just today in Manchester someone else
 
06:12:19.970 --> 06:12:19.980 align:start position:0%
went and robbed store used a box cutter
 
06:12:21.708 --> 06:12:21.718 align:start position:0%
was arrested
 
06:12:23.990 --> 06:12:24.000 align:start position:0%
found out this was a person that was out
 
06:12:26.390 --> 06:12:26.400 align:start position:0%
on bail and Senator Bradley can speak to
 
06:12:29.930 --> 06:12:29.940 align:start position:0%
an issue that happened today in Nashua
 
06:12:31.910 --> 06:12:31.920 align:start position:0%
same thing someone's out on bail
 
06:12:34.010 --> 06:12:34.020 align:start position:0%
committing another crime
 
06:12:37.490 --> 06:12:37.500 align:start position:0%
how many times does this have to happen
 
06:12:40.970 --> 06:12:40.980 align:start position:0%
before this legislative body is going to
 
06:12:43.128 --> 06:12:43.138 align:start position:0%
say we've had enough we're going to do
 
06:12:44.868 --> 06:12:44.878 align:start position:0%
something about it because that's what
 
06:12:46.430 --> 06:12:46.440 align:start position:0%
we're hearing from our constituents
 
06:12:49.368 --> 06:12:49.378 align:start position:0%
we're hearing from not only our
 
06:12:51.470 --> 06:12:51.480 align:start position:0%
constituents but we're hearing from law
 
06:12:54.530 --> 06:12:54.540 align:start position:0%
enforcement we are hearing from mayors
 
06:12:57.350 --> 06:12:57.360 align:start position:0%
of cities and on Senator Susie can speak
 
06:12:59.570 --> 06:12:59.580 align:start position:0%
to that because the mayor of Manchester
 
06:13:02.510 --> 06:13:02.520 align:start position:0%
came into our committee to testify in
 
06:13:04.788 --> 06:13:04.798 align:start position:0%
support of this legislation they need
 
06:13:07.610 --> 06:13:07.620 align:start position:0%
our help and they need our help and they
 
06:13:10.430 --> 06:13:10.440 align:start position:0%
needed our help two years ago but quite
 
06:13:12.770 --> 06:13:12.780 align:start position:0%
frankly we couldn't get out of our own
 
06:13:15.230 --> 06:13:15.240 align:start position:0%
way because everyone wants to have
 
06:13:17.030 --> 06:13:17.040 align:start position:0%
something to say and put their fingers
 
06:13:19.128 --> 06:13:19.138 align:start position:0%
on it or do something and in the
 
06:13:21.948 --> 06:13:21.958 align:start position:0%
meantime crime is flourishing out in our
 
06:13:23.510 --> 06:13:23.520 align:start position:0%
communities and our constituents are
 
06:13:26.208 --> 06:13:26.218 align:start position:0%
asking for our help now we have an
 
06:13:28.310 --> 06:13:28.320 align:start position:0%
opportunity to do something this is very
 
06:13:30.770 --> 06:13:30.780 align:start position:0%
clear about exactly
 
06:13:33.590 --> 06:13:33.600 align:start position:0%
what is supposed to be happening
 
06:13:35.990 --> 06:13:36.000 align:start position:0%
representative we took the language that
 
06:13:39.470 --> 06:13:39.480 align:start position:0%
you wanted concerning the um the million
 
06:13:42.830 --> 06:13:42.840 align:start position:0%
dollars to um to do this electronic
 
06:13:44.690 --> 06:13:44.700 align:start position:0%
system so that there's better
 
06:13:44.700 --> 06:13:46.250 align:start position:0%
system so that there's better
communication

06:13:46.250 --> 06:13:46.260 align:start position:0%
communication
 
06:13:49.010 --> 06:13:49.020 align:start position:0%
what else do we need to do here
 
06:13:51.110 --> 06:13:51.120 align:start position:0%
how many times do we have to keep coming
 
06:13:53.990 --> 06:13:54.000 align:start position:0%
to the house to say look we need to fix
 
06:13:54.000 --> 06:13:55.070 align:start position:0%
to the house to say look we need to fix
this

06:13:55.070 --> 06:13:55.080 align:start position:0%
this
 
06:13:58.250 --> 06:13:58.260 align:start position:0%
and not keep running into a wall where
 
06:13:59.930 --> 06:13:59.940 align:start position:0%
people say we don't want to touch this
 
06:14:02.270 --> 06:14:02.280 align:start position:0%
we don't want this to move we want to
 
06:14:04.250 --> 06:14:04.260 align:start position:0%
leave this in place but in the meantime
 
06:14:06.770 --> 06:14:06.780 align:start position:0%
the police are complaining and our
 
06:14:08.868 --> 06:14:08.878 align:start position:0%
constituents are complaining what else
 
06:14:10.430 --> 06:14:10.440 align:start position:0%
needs to happen
 
06:14:13.010 --> 06:14:13.020 align:start position:0%
we've looked at this this is the third
 
06:14:13.020 --> 06:14:14.330 align:start position:0%
we've looked at this this is the third
biennium

06:14:14.330 --> 06:14:14.340 align:start position:0%
biennium
 
06:14:16.010 --> 06:14:16.020 align:start position:0%
what else
 
06:14:18.350 --> 06:14:18.360 align:start position:0%
what else do we need to do and let's see
 
06:14:20.868 --> 06:14:20.878 align:start position:0%
if we can resolve it here and now so
 
06:14:22.910 --> 06:14:22.920 align:start position:0%
that by the time we're finished at the
 
06:14:25.548 --> 06:14:25.558 align:start position:0%
end of June our constituents are going
 
06:14:28.250 --> 06:14:28.260 align:start position:0%
to know that their safety is being
 
06:14:30.288 --> 06:14:30.298 align:start position:0%
respected and we've done something about
 
06:14:33.830 --> 06:14:33.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:33.840 --> 06:14:35.810 align:start position:0%
 
chairman

06:14:35.810 --> 06:14:35.820 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
06:14:39.230 --> 06:14:39.240 align:start position:0%
um sure um what else do we need to do
 
06:14:42.110 --> 06:14:42.120 align:start position:0%
let's start with Okay so let's take
 
06:14:45.110 --> 06:14:45.120 align:start position:0%
what's in here right now if you commit a
 
06:14:46.910 --> 06:14:46.920 align:start position:0%
b or c you're held over for the judge
 
06:14:49.850 --> 06:14:49.860 align:start position:0%
does it mandate the judge does it change
 
06:14:51.230 --> 06:14:51.240 align:start position:0%
the standards that we're putting it by
 
06:14:52.850 --> 06:14:52.860 align:start position:0%
bail reform as far as what the judge
 
06:14:55.610 --> 06:14:55.620 align:start position:0%
does because if it doesn't it's he's
 
06:14:57.350 --> 06:14:57.360 align:start position:0%
just all you're doing is holding them
 
06:14:59.150 --> 06:14:59.160 align:start position:0%
for three more days the judge is still
 
06:15:01.070 --> 06:15:01.080 align:start position:0%
going to follow the existing existing
 
06:15:03.048 --> 06:15:03.058 align:start position:0%
mandate in the barrel form which is the
 
06:15:04.548 --> 06:15:04.558 align:start position:0%
preference that they be released on
 
06:15:07.310 --> 06:15:07.320 align:start position:0%
personal recognizance okay thank you
 
06:15:09.650 --> 06:15:09.660 align:start position:0%
representative I I would look at
 
06:15:12.948 --> 06:15:12.958 align:start position:0%
somebody by the Senate page two except
 
06:15:17.448 --> 06:15:17.458 align:start position:0%
as provided under 597 c a colon c uh
 
06:15:20.930 --> 06:15:20.940 align:start position:0%
excuse me one C A person who is charged
 
06:15:23.330 --> 06:15:23.340 align:start position:0%
with homicide and it tells the judge
 
06:15:25.310 --> 06:15:25.320 align:start position:0%
these are the people that are not going
 
06:15:27.770 --> 06:15:27.780 align:start position:0%
to get bail reform we're not talking
 
06:15:30.410 --> 06:15:30.420 align:start position:0%
about someone who gets arrested for
 
06:15:33.410 --> 06:15:33.420 align:start position:0%
shoplifting or something like that
 
06:15:35.448 --> 06:15:35.458 align:start position:0%
those are the ones that we've said okay
 
06:15:38.270 --> 06:15:38.280 align:start position:0%
it's a non-violent crime these are
 
06:15:40.368 --> 06:15:40.378 align:start position:0%
violent crimes where people are being
 
06:15:43.128 --> 06:15:43.138 align:start position:0%
put back out on the street it's a
 
06:15:45.650 --> 06:15:45.660 align:start position:0%
revolving door we need to stop the
 
06:15:50.030 --> 06:15:50.040 align:start position:0%
revolving door so this I think gives a
 
06:15:53.690 --> 06:15:53.700 align:start position:0%
lot of leeway to the judges about who's
 
06:15:56.090 --> 06:15:56.100 align:start position:0%
coming out believe me if someone who's
 
06:15:58.430 --> 06:15:58.440 align:start position:0%
committed an aggravated felonious sexual
 
06:16:01.310 --> 06:16:01.320 align:start position:0%
assault should under no circumstance get
 
06:16:03.530 --> 06:16:03.540 align:start position:0%
bail none
 
06:16:03.540 --> 06:16:05.750 align:start position:0%
bail none
none

06:16:05.750 --> 06:16:05.760 align:start position:0%
none
 
06:16:08.570 --> 06:16:08.580 align:start position:0%
and if they do get fail
 
06:16:10.548 --> 06:16:10.558 align:start position:0%
shouldn't they be answerable to somebody
 
06:16:11.810 --> 06:16:11.820 align:start position:0%
for that
 
06:16:11.820 --> 06:16:13.070 align:start position:0%
for that
absolutely

06:16:13.070 --> 06:16:13.080 align:start position:0%
absolutely
 
06:16:15.470 --> 06:16:15.480 align:start position:0%
so this is what we're looking at these
 
06:16:18.048 --> 06:16:18.058 align:start position:0%
are violent defenses not non-violent
 
06:16:20.628 --> 06:16:20.638 align:start position:0%
defenses which I think should be the
 
06:16:24.128 --> 06:16:24.138 align:start position:0%
clear line when it comes to bail reform
 
06:16:26.170 --> 06:16:26.180 align:start position:0%
as I said we're not talking about
 
06:16:29.208 --> 06:16:29.218 align:start position:0%
shoplifting or some of these other small
 
06:16:31.670 --> 06:16:31.680 align:start position:0%
little petty crimes I agree they should
 
06:16:33.590 --> 06:16:33.600 align:start position:0%
not be held
 
06:16:35.930 --> 06:16:35.940 align:start position:0%
because for some folks it makes a
 
06:16:37.128 --> 06:16:37.138 align:start position:0%
difference whether or not they're going
 
06:16:40.250 --> 06:16:40.260 align:start position:0%
to lose their job or they're going to
 
06:16:41.810 --> 06:16:41.820 align:start position:0%
um you know they don't have enough money
 
06:16:44.570 --> 06:16:44.580 align:start position:0%
to pay for their rent or food or their
 
06:16:46.610 --> 06:16:46.620 align:start position:0%
family or pay for their honor me
 
06:16:49.310 --> 06:16:49.320 align:start position:0%
automobile so they can go to work we're
 
06:16:50.810 --> 06:16:50.820 align:start position:0%
talking about people that are committing
 
06:16:54.350 --> 06:16:54.360 align:start position:0%
violent crimes
 
06:16:56.990 --> 06:16:57.000 align:start position:0%
violent crimes that's what we're asking
 
06:16:59.930 --> 06:16:59.940 align:start position:0%
of the house can you recognize that
 
06:17:01.788 --> 06:17:01.798 align:start position:0%
these are violent crimes that are
 
06:17:04.010 --> 06:17:04.020 align:start position:0%
committed against our fellow citizens in
 
06:17:06.530 --> 06:17:06.540 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire that they
 
06:17:09.110 --> 06:17:09.120 align:start position:0%
should not get bail
 
06:17:09.120 --> 06:17:13.788 align:start position:0%
should not get bail
none

06:17:13.788 --> 06:17:13.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:17.330 --> 06:17:17.340 align:start position:0%
um I I would I would I would agree uh
 
06:17:19.670 --> 06:17:19.680 align:start position:0%
with several caveats first of all it's
 
06:17:21.530 --> 06:17:21.540 align:start position:0%
incumbent upon us to recognize that
 
06:17:23.330 --> 06:17:23.340 align:start position:0%
under our system of justice everyone is
 
06:17:24.830 --> 06:17:24.840 align:start position:0%
innocent until proven guilty in the
 
06:17:27.048 --> 06:17:27.058 align:start position:0%
court of law so there are accused of
 
06:17:29.868 --> 06:17:29.878 align:start position:0%
violent crimes as part of that admit
 
06:17:31.128 --> 06:17:31.138 align:start position:0%
deciding whether or not they should be
 
06:17:32.868 --> 06:17:32.878 align:start position:0%
allowed bail or not should be a weight
 
06:17:36.190 --> 06:17:36.200 align:start position:0%
of their of their um criminal record
 
06:17:40.670 --> 06:17:40.680 align:start position:0%
of their um propensity for showing up to
 
06:17:42.530 --> 06:17:42.540 align:start position:0%
court when they're supposed to where
 
06:17:44.330 --> 06:17:44.340 align:start position:0%
they're from are they are they from out
 
06:17:45.650 --> 06:17:45.660 align:start position:0%
of state they're not probably not going
 
06:17:46.730 --> 06:17:46.740 align:start position:0%
to come back there's a lot of things
 
06:17:49.010 --> 06:17:49.020 align:start position:0%
that go into that and I feel without
 
06:17:50.330 --> 06:17:50.340 align:start position:0%
giving it
 
06:17:52.670 --> 06:17:52.680 align:start position:0%
um more consideration and getting into
 
06:17:54.350 --> 06:17:54.360 align:start position:0%
the details of things in the springing
 
06:17:56.270 --> 06:17:56.280 align:start position:0%
up throwing out a blanket these people
 
06:17:58.310 --> 06:17:58.320 align:start position:0%
are going to be held I just don't know
 
06:17:59.810 --> 06:17:59.820 align:start position:0%
that it's going to it's going to solve
 
06:18:01.010 --> 06:18:01.020 align:start position:0%
our issue and we'll be back here again
 
06:18:03.288 --> 06:18:03.298 align:start position:0%
next year and say Well they're still
 
06:18:06.230 --> 06:18:06.240 align:start position:0%
getting out because the judge says let
 
06:18:08.090 --> 06:18:08.100 align:start position:0%
them go
 
06:18:10.250 --> 06:18:10.260 align:start position:0%
well representative I'd like to put out
 
06:18:12.170 --> 06:18:12.180 align:start position:0%
that they have to go in front of a judge
 
06:18:14.510 --> 06:18:14.520 align:start position:0%
yes okay it's not a bail commissioner
 
06:18:17.510 --> 06:18:17.520 align:start position:0%
it's a judge and if I remember correctly
 
06:18:21.410 --> 06:18:21.420 align:start position:0%
last biennium we did have Provisions in
 
06:18:23.810 --> 06:18:23.820 align:start position:0%
there concerning someone who had who's
 
06:18:26.990 --> 06:18:27.000 align:start position:0%
been out on bail and who has broken the
 
06:18:28.730 --> 06:18:28.740 align:start position:0%
law again that there were going to be
 
06:18:31.190 --> 06:18:31.200 align:start position:0%
Provisions for them to be held but
 
06:18:34.070 --> 06:18:34.080 align:start position:0%
unfortunately it died the house did not
 
06:18:34.080 --> 06:18:34.910 align:start position:0%
unfortunately it died the house did not
agree

06:18:34.910 --> 06:18:34.920 align:start position:0%
agree
 
06:18:34.920 --> 06:18:37.070 align:start position:0%
agree
so

06:18:37.070 --> 06:18:37.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:18:40.490 --> 06:18:40.500 align:start position:0%
we try so what else do you what else do
 
06:18:43.010 --> 06:18:43.020 align:start position:0%
you want what else what else do you want
 
06:18:46.070 --> 06:18:46.080 align:start position:0%
in here that's not here that has not
 
06:18:48.350 --> 06:18:48.360 align:start position:0%
been tried before
 
06:18:55.490 --> 06:18:55.500 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:57.530 --> 06:18:57.540 align:start position:0%
um thank you part of it too is it needs
 
06:18:59.448 --> 06:18:59.458 align:start position:0%
to not just be what we here can agree to
 
06:19:00.770 --> 06:19:00.780 align:start position:0%
it needs to be something that can be
 
06:19:02.750 --> 06:19:02.760 align:start position:0%
agreed to by the house as a whole as
 
06:19:03.948 --> 06:19:03.958 align:start position:0%
well and I don't know if there's other
 
06:19:05.448 --> 06:19:05.458 align:start position:0%
viewpoints as well that you'd like to
 
06:19:10.448 --> 06:19:10.458 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:13.610 --> 06:19:13.620 align:start position:0%
I I don't think so I think I think
 
06:19:16.368 --> 06:19:16.378 align:start position:0%
representative Roy has said pretty much
 
06:19:18.590 --> 06:19:18.600 align:start position:0%
all of it I I will
 
06:19:21.048 --> 06:19:21.058 align:start position:0%
remind people that
 
06:19:24.048 --> 06:19:24.058 align:start position:0%
as much as this goes to judges
 
06:19:26.270 --> 06:19:26.280 align:start position:0%
instead of bail Commissioners which is
 
06:19:26.280 --> 06:19:27.890 align:start position:0%
instead of bail Commissioners which is
better

06:19:27.890 --> 06:19:27.900 align:start position:0%
better
 
06:19:30.788 --> 06:19:30.798 align:start position:0%
uh the
 
06:19:34.368 --> 06:19:34.378 align:start position:0%
accusations of Major Crimes
 
06:19:37.490 --> 06:19:37.500 align:start position:0%
and incorrect accusations tends to fall
 
06:19:39.410 --> 06:19:39.420 align:start position:0%
more on certain groups of our sitters
 
06:19:41.030 --> 06:19:41.040 align:start position:0%
and raid than others
 
06:19:43.368 --> 06:19:43.378 align:start position:0%
and that's always a concern and I know
 
06:19:44.930 --> 06:19:44.940 align:start position:0%
it's been a concern of the house
 
06:19:47.470 --> 06:19:47.480 align:start position:0%
throughout this process
 
06:19:51.650 --> 06:19:51.660 align:start position:0%
but I I just would feel more comfortable
 
06:19:53.390 --> 06:19:53.400 align:start position:0%
going with the other
 
06:19:55.368 --> 06:19:55.378 align:start position:0%
with the other way of dealing with this
 
06:19:57.788 --> 06:19:57.798 align:start position:0%
the the committee retained
 
06:20:01.250 --> 06:20:01.260 align:start position:0%
the Senate bill in question for a reason
 
06:20:03.770 --> 06:20:03.780 align:start position:0%
and I think that that is the house
 
06:20:05.570 --> 06:20:05.580 align:start position:0%
position and I think that we should
 
06:20:09.610 --> 06:20:09.620 align:start position:0%
defend it I think that we would have
 
06:20:13.490 --> 06:20:13.500 align:start position:0%
significant problems getting these
 
06:20:15.110 --> 06:20:15.120 align:start position:0%
Provisions through the house as a
 
06:20:17.170 --> 06:20:17.180 align:start position:0%
committee of conference
 
06:20:17.180 --> 06:20:18.970 align:start position:0%
committee of conference
recommendation

06:20:18.970 --> 06:20:18.980 align:start position:0%
recommendation
 
06:20:22.788 --> 06:20:22.798 align:start position:0%
and and again we have to have a
 
06:20:25.190 --> 06:20:25.200 align:start position:0%
significant concurrence on that to get
 
06:20:28.250 --> 06:20:28.260 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:29.810 --> 06:20:29.820 align:start position:0%
thank you for bringing some of the
 
06:20:31.368 --> 06:20:31.378 align:start position:0%
viewpoints that we do have in the house
 
06:20:33.650 --> 06:20:33.660 align:start position:0%
we do have the we do have the you have
 
06:20:33.660 --> 06:20:35.390 align:start position:0%
we do have the we do have the you have
more

06:20:35.390 --> 06:20:35.400 align:start position:0%
more
 
06:20:38.270 --> 06:20:38.280 align:start position:0%
um I I was just going to say that as as
 
06:20:41.150 --> 06:20:41.160 align:start position:0%
to the last two Provisions
 
06:20:41.160 --> 06:20:42.530 align:start position:0%
to the last two Provisions
um

06:20:42.530 --> 06:20:42.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:20:44.930 --> 06:20:44.940 align:start position:0%
uh five and six which do not have to do
 
06:20:47.150 --> 06:20:47.160 align:start position:0%
with with bail
 
06:20:51.730 --> 06:20:51.740 align:start position:0%
um whether it goes on 611 or this bill I
 
06:20:54.708 --> 06:20:54.718 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm neutral to I believe they're the
 
06:20:56.930 --> 06:20:56.940 align:start position:0%
same Provisions so
 
06:20:59.570 --> 06:20:59.580 align:start position:0%
um if if that's helpful to have them
 
06:21:01.250 --> 06:21:01.260 align:start position:0%
here rather than somewhere else that's
 
06:21:03.708 --> 06:21:03.718 align:start position:0%
not going to be a problem but it's it's
 
06:21:07.610 --> 06:21:07.620 align:start position:0%
the bail issues that are and and the
 
06:21:10.190 --> 06:21:10.200 align:start position:0%
discussions I've had with people are
 
06:21:12.110 --> 06:21:12.120 align:start position:0%
basically that the bail Provisions are
 
06:21:14.510 --> 06:21:14.520 align:start position:0%
are really a sticking point for the
 
06:21:17.390 --> 06:21:17.400 align:start position:0%
people I've spoken to in the house
 
06:21:19.850 --> 06:21:19.860 align:start position:0%
thank you um we actually did have uh
 
06:21:21.470 --> 06:21:21.480 align:start position:0%
quite a few challenges even getting to a
 
06:21:23.390 --> 06:21:23.400 align:start position:0%
committee of conference on this bill um
 
06:21:25.670 --> 06:21:25.680 align:start position:0%
regarding the Bell reform language most
 
06:21:28.310 --> 06:21:28.320 align:start position:0%
particularly in section three
 
06:21:30.170 --> 06:21:30.180 align:start position:0%
um so heading back to the house with the
 
06:21:31.850 --> 06:21:31.860 align:start position:0%
language that passed the Senate would be
 
06:21:34.548 --> 06:21:34.558 align:start position:0%
an exercise in futility at best
 
06:21:34.558 --> 06:21:35.690 align:start position:0%
an exercise in futility at best
um

06:21:35.690 --> 06:21:35.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:21:38.150 --> 06:21:38.160 align:start position:0%
I have a question around the section
 
06:21:41.208 --> 06:21:41.218 align:start position:0%
four I know that we've had you know many
 
06:21:43.910 --> 06:21:43.920 align:start position:0%
high-profile cases hit too far too close
 
06:21:46.788 --> 06:21:46.798 align:start position:0%
to many of us I don't know um to what
 
06:21:48.948 --> 06:21:48.958 align:start position:0%
impact we've had people who are out on
 
06:21:50.830 --> 06:21:50.840 align:start position:0%
bail and one jurisdiction and not
 
06:21:53.868 --> 06:21:53.878 align:start position:0%
recognized in another jurisdiction and
 
06:21:55.548 --> 06:21:55.558 align:start position:0%
therefore released and going on for
 
06:21:57.708 --> 06:21:57.718 align:start position:0%
other crimes do we have any information
 
06:21:59.690 --> 06:21:59.700 align:start position:0%
as to how this would increase Public
 
06:22:02.208 --> 06:22:02.218 align:start position:0%
Safety to have that appropriation if we
 
06:22:04.910 --> 06:22:04.920 align:start position:0%
were able to get have that we I don't
 
06:22:06.350 --> 06:22:06.360 align:start position:0%
see actually I guess my first question
 
06:22:09.948 --> 06:22:09.958 align:start position:0%
is I don't see the side of the the part
 
06:22:12.170 --> 06:22:12.180 align:start position:0%
of the negotiations agreeing to continue
 
06:22:15.350 --> 06:22:15.360 align:start position:0%
with section three in the bill my
 
06:22:16.610 --> 06:22:16.620 align:start position:0%
question I guess for the Senate would be
 
06:22:18.410 --> 06:22:18.420 align:start position:0%
if there's any path forward to this bill
 
06:22:20.750 --> 06:22:20.760 align:start position:0%
without Section 3 or not
 
06:22:25.010 --> 06:22:25.020 align:start position:0%
could I have a caucus yes please yes a
 
06:22:28.788 --> 06:22:28.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:28.798 --> 06:32:01.730 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

06:32:01.730 --> 06:32:01.740 align:start position:0%
 
06:32:03.948 --> 06:32:03.958 align:start position:0%
uh thank you very much and thank you for
 
06:32:05.890 --> 06:32:05.900 align:start position:0%
giving us the time for that caucus
 
06:32:08.390 --> 06:32:08.400 align:start position:0%
section three is a complete sticking
 
06:32:09.948 --> 06:32:09.958 align:start position:0%
point for the house it's not going to
 
06:32:12.170 --> 06:32:12.180 align:start position:0%
pass it is it is written
 
06:32:15.590 --> 06:32:15.600 align:start position:0%
um if we were if I'd like to know the
 
06:32:17.750 --> 06:32:17.760 align:start position:0%
whether or not the Senate would be
 
06:32:19.850 --> 06:32:19.860 align:start position:0%
amenable to discussion section 4 and the
 
06:32:22.910 --> 06:32:22.920 align:start position:0%
rest of the bill without section three
 
06:32:24.890 --> 06:32:24.900 align:start position:0%
um if that's the case we'd like to be
 
06:32:26.810 --> 06:32:26.820 align:start position:0%
able to then come back and recess and
 
06:32:29.090 --> 06:32:29.100 align:start position:0%
come to another day in order to better
 
06:32:31.368 --> 06:32:31.378 align:start position:0%
discuss section four and making sure
 
06:32:34.490 --> 06:32:34.500 align:start position:0%
that the legislators and the people and
 
06:32:36.110 --> 06:32:36.120 align:start position:0%
most importantly all the Departments
 
06:32:39.590 --> 06:32:39.600 align:start position:0%
involved in this have the information
 
06:32:41.390 --> 06:32:41.400 align:start position:0%
and data so that they know who actually
 
06:32:43.368 --> 06:32:43.378 align:start position:0%
is out on bail so that they're not
 
06:32:45.788 --> 06:32:45.798 align:start position:0%
Flying Blind on a paper-based system
 
06:32:48.170 --> 06:32:48.180 align:start position:0%
but in order to do that we'd need to
 
06:32:50.690 --> 06:32:50.700 align:start position:0%
know whether or not Section 3 is a
 
06:32:53.270 --> 06:32:53.280 align:start position:0%
must-have for the Senate so I'd like to
 
06:32:55.070 --> 06:32:55.080 align:start position:0%
find out if Section 3 is a sticking
 
06:32:56.750 --> 06:32:56.760 align:start position:0%
point and it's either section three or
 
06:32:58.548 --> 06:32:58.558 align:start position:0%
nothing or if there's room for
 
06:32:58.558 --> 06:33:05.170 align:start position:0%
nothing or if there's room for
negotiation

06:33:05.170 --> 06:33:05.180 align:start position:0%
 
06:33:07.670 --> 06:33:07.680 align:start position:0%
not likely
 
06:33:09.590 --> 06:33:09.600 align:start position:0%
so let me just say a couple of things
 
06:33:11.448 --> 06:33:11.458 align:start position:0%
about section four
 
06:33:16.368 --> 06:33:16.378 align:start position:0%
because it was in hb2 and we pulled it
 
06:33:16.378 --> 06:33:17.570 align:start position:0%
because it was in hb2 and we pulled it
out

06:33:17.570 --> 06:33:17.580 align:start position:0%
out
 
06:33:22.430 --> 06:33:22.440 align:start position:0%
to put in this bill to try and
 
06:33:24.170 --> 06:33:24.180 align:start position:0%
create something a little bit more
 
06:33:26.810 --> 06:33:26.820 align:start position:0%
comprehensive it really needs an
 
06:33:29.330 --> 06:33:29.340 align:start position:0%
appropriation of 750
 
06:33:30.590 --> 06:33:30.600 align:start position:0%
000 dollars
 
06:33:33.770 --> 06:33:33.780 align:start position:0%
for that apartment of safety and almost
 
06:33:36.110 --> 06:33:36.120 align:start position:0%
a million dollars for the court system
 
06:33:38.690 --> 06:33:38.700 align:start position:0%
to implement that that's the testimony
 
06:33:42.730 --> 06:33:42.740 align:start position:0%
we got I have an amendment prepared
 
06:33:48.230 --> 06:33:48.240 align:start position:0%
uh to do that if we choose to go forward
 
06:33:50.868 --> 06:33:50.878 align:start position:0%
I think the problem that we're having
 
06:33:55.128 --> 06:33:55.138 align:start position:0%
 
06:33:58.910 --> 06:33:58.920 align:start position:0%
those of us that supported in 2018
 
06:34:01.430 --> 06:34:01.440 align:start position:0%
the bill were promised by The Advocates
 
06:34:03.350 --> 06:34:03.360 align:start position:0%
for the bill that violent criminals were
 
06:34:04.850 --> 06:34:04.860 align:start position:0%
not going to be let out well that's
 
06:34:06.770 --> 06:34:06.780 align:start position:0%
wrong that is patently wrong and
 
06:34:09.948 --> 06:34:09.958 align:start position:0%
everybody in this room knows it's wrong
 
06:34:13.128 --> 06:34:13.138 align:start position:0%
so the Senate has passed three separate
 
06:34:15.948 --> 06:34:15.958 align:start position:0%
in three separate years bills two of
 
06:34:19.010 --> 06:34:19.020 align:start position:0%
which have been mined in 21 and 22 and
 
06:34:23.570 --> 06:34:23.580 align:start position:0%
then Senator Susie's in 23. and quite
 
06:34:25.910 --> 06:34:25.920 align:start position:0%
frankly you guys haven't even tried to
 
06:34:28.490 --> 06:34:28.500 align:start position:0%
pass it so we're frustrated
 
06:34:30.350 --> 06:34:30.360 align:start position:0%
we thought we were getting
 
06:34:33.048 --> 06:34:33.058 align:start position:0%
to some progress last year but
 
06:34:34.548 --> 06:34:34.558 align:start position:0%
unfortunately in the committee of
 
06:34:38.330 --> 06:34:38.340 align:start position:0%
conference we linked the three strikes
 
06:34:42.470 --> 06:34:42.480 align:start position:0%
or no shows three strike no-shows to
 
06:34:46.430 --> 06:34:46.440 align:start position:0%
what is a very surgical approach in
 
06:34:49.190 --> 06:34:49.200 align:start position:0%
Senator Susie's bill
 
06:34:51.350 --> 06:34:51.360 align:start position:0%
and we thought we had an agreement and
 
06:34:54.110 --> 06:34:54.120 align:start position:0%
then turned out that the sponsor of that
 
06:34:57.410 --> 06:34:57.420 align:start position:0%
didn't have the right language and it
 
06:34:59.270 --> 06:34:59.280 align:start position:0%
was after the deadline for committee a
 
06:35:01.548 --> 06:35:01.558 align:start position:0%
conference so
 
06:35:01.558 --> 06:35:03.048 align:start position:0%
conference so
um

06:35:03.048 --> 06:35:03.058 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:35:04.490 --> 06:35:04.500 align:start position:0%
you know
 
06:35:06.948 --> 06:35:06.958 align:start position:0%
the rest is history couldn't couldn't go
 
06:35:08.628 --> 06:35:08.638 align:start position:0%
forward it
 
06:35:12.170 --> 06:35:12.180 align:start position:0%
undermined the entire bill so
 
06:35:12.180 --> 06:35:13.128 align:start position:0%
undermined the entire bill so
um

06:35:13.128 --> 06:35:13.138 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:35:15.288 --> 06:35:15.298 align:start position:0%
you know we sit here
 
06:35:18.288 --> 06:35:18.298 align:start position:0%
we know it's a problem
 
06:35:20.448 --> 06:35:20.458 align:start position:0%
we really know it's a problem we have
 
06:35:23.270 --> 06:35:23.280 align:start position:0%
example after example I mean Senator
 
06:35:26.030 --> 06:35:26.040 align:start position:0%
Carson talked about one I have one just
 
06:35:28.730 --> 06:35:28.740 align:start position:0%
in the last couple of days
 
06:35:31.610 --> 06:35:31.620 align:start position:0%
I think we would all agree that we need
 
06:35:35.330 --> 06:35:35.340 align:start position:0%
to do everything possible
 
06:35:37.610 --> 06:35:37.620 align:start position:0%
to protect people
 
06:35:40.430 --> 06:35:40.440 align:start position:0%
in their homes on our streets from
 
06:35:42.350 --> 06:35:42.360 align:start position:0%
violent crime and we're not doing it
 
06:35:45.530 --> 06:35:45.540 align:start position:0%
quite frankly and we've seen the failure
 
06:35:50.570 --> 06:35:50.580 align:start position:0%
despite the promises of the legislation
 
06:35:53.330 --> 06:35:53.340 align:start position:0%
there was enacted in 2018 which
 
06:35:55.250 --> 06:35:55.260 align:start position:0%
regrettably I have to say I voted for
 
06:35:57.230 --> 06:35:57.240 align:start position:0%
because I was promised something that
 
06:35:59.208 --> 06:35:59.218 align:start position:0%
hasn't happened that's why we're
 
06:36:01.730 --> 06:36:01.740 align:start position:0%
frustrated that's why as far as I'm
 
06:36:05.150 --> 06:36:05.160 align:start position:0%
concerned no is the answer no
 
06:36:08.628 --> 06:36:08.638 align:start position:0%
negotiations unless Section 3 is in it
 
06:36:11.090 --> 06:36:11.100 align:start position:0%
so here's what I'd suggest you have the
 
06:36:14.090 --> 06:36:14.100 align:start position:0%
Senate leadership sitting here okay I'd
 
06:36:16.670 --> 06:36:16.680 align:start position:0%
suggest you go back and talk with your
 
06:36:18.470 --> 06:36:18.480 align:start position:0%
leadership both on the Republican side
 
06:36:21.070 --> 06:36:21.080 align:start position:0%
and the Democratic side before you say
 
06:36:24.170 --> 06:36:24.180 align:start position:0%
categorically which is your apparently
 
06:36:26.868 --> 06:36:26.878 align:start position:0%
your excuse for not even willing to talk
 
06:36:28.430 --> 06:36:28.440 align:start position:0%
about section three that it can't get
 
06:36:30.890 --> 06:36:30.900 align:start position:0%
through the house
 
06:36:33.110 --> 06:36:33.120 align:start position:0%
I would recommend you to that and we
 
06:36:35.170 --> 06:36:35.180 align:start position:0%
come back in a couple of days
 
06:36:38.628 --> 06:36:38.638 align:start position:0%
yeah yes I um first of all there's no
 
06:36:40.788 --> 06:36:40.798 align:start position:0%
excuse for anything if you I suggest you
 
06:36:42.410 --> 06:36:42.420 align:start position:0%
look at the vote record in the house and
 
06:36:44.208 --> 06:36:44.218 align:start position:0%
you'll understand why we say it won't
 
06:36:45.770 --> 06:36:45.780 align:start position:0%
pass the house
 
06:36:48.048 --> 06:36:48.058 align:start position:0%
um if it was representative Roy here
 
06:36:49.730 --> 06:36:49.740 align:start position:0%
today I'd probably agree with that I
 
06:36:51.048 --> 06:36:51.058 align:start position:0%
might want a couple of the things in it
 
06:36:54.410 --> 06:36:54.420 align:start position:0%
but it's not and I don't see the point
 
06:36:57.110 --> 06:36:57.120 align:start position:0%
of replacing the Democrat members and
 
06:36:58.788 --> 06:36:58.798 align:start position:0%
passing it just to see the thing go down
 
06:37:01.310 --> 06:37:01.320 align:start position:0%
in flames in the house I just it's a
 
06:37:04.310 --> 06:37:04.320 align:start position:0%
it's exercising futility so I'd love to
 
06:37:06.530 --> 06:37:06.540 align:start position:0%
pass something but it we have to pass
 
06:37:07.910 --> 06:37:07.920 align:start position:0%
something that will pass the whole body
 
06:37:11.090 --> 06:37:11.100 align:start position:0%
so but I'm happy to go back and see what
 
06:37:12.948 --> 06:37:12.958 align:start position:0%
we can do well and thank you for that
 
06:37:14.330 --> 06:37:14.340 align:start position:0%
actually you bring up some really good
 
06:37:16.368 --> 06:37:16.378 align:start position:0%
points that are part of why I'm
 
06:37:18.048 --> 06:37:18.058 align:start position:0%
reluctant to move forward on this today
 
06:37:21.170 --> 06:37:21.180 align:start position:0%
you we know that when Bell reform first
 
06:37:22.910 --> 06:37:22.920 align:start position:0%
came through we were trying to address a
 
06:37:24.110 --> 06:37:24.120 align:start position:0%
problem and we thought that that
 
06:37:25.610 --> 06:37:25.620 align:start position:0%
legislation was going to address it
 
06:37:27.708 --> 06:37:27.718 align:start position:0%
there were promises made that certain
 
06:37:29.330 --> 06:37:29.340 align:start position:0%
things would happen but then the
 
06:37:30.890 --> 06:37:30.900 align:start position:0%
legislation didn't follow through on
 
06:37:33.470 --> 06:37:33.480 align:start position:0%
that I personally believe that we need
 
06:37:35.270 --> 06:37:35.280 align:start position:0%
to have criminal the house criminal
 
06:37:36.890 --> 06:37:36.900 align:start position:0%
justice committee come out with a
 
06:37:38.990 --> 06:37:39.000 align:start position:0%
recommendation on what to do
 
06:37:41.330 --> 06:37:41.340 align:start position:0%
or elsewhere in the possible situation
 
06:37:43.310 --> 06:37:43.320 align:start position:0%
of seeing another unintended consequence
 
06:37:45.170 --> 06:37:45.180 align:start position:0%
by putting something through that we
 
06:37:46.970 --> 06:37:46.980 align:start position:0%
don't that we don't know all the pieces
 
06:37:48.288 --> 06:37:48.298 align:start position:0%
on the board
 
06:37:51.048 --> 06:37:51.058 align:start position:0%
um between the fact that we know that
 
06:37:53.090 --> 06:37:53.100 align:start position:0%
the existing language does not have the
 
06:37:55.850 --> 06:37:55.860 align:start position:0%
votes and the fact that we've already
 
06:37:57.948 --> 06:37:57.958 align:start position:0%
committed by retaining every single bill
 
06:38:00.590 --> 06:38:00.600 align:start position:0%
on this topic in order to bring forward
 
06:38:03.350 --> 06:38:03.360 align:start position:0%
a comprehensive plan to address this and
 
06:38:04.730 --> 06:38:04.740 align:start position:0%
make sure that while we're making sure
 
06:38:06.350 --> 06:38:06.360 align:start position:0%
that violent criminals are off of the
 
06:38:08.330 --> 06:38:08.340 align:start position:0%
streets we're also not accidentally
 
06:38:09.830 --> 06:38:09.840 align:start position:0%
sweeping up other people who have been
 
06:38:12.170 --> 06:38:12.180 align:start position:0%
accused of a crime but that accusation
 
06:38:15.230 --> 06:38:15.240 align:start position:0%
is false or malicious it's it's a
 
06:38:17.030 --> 06:38:17.040 align:start position:0%
delicate balance it's an absolutely
 
06:38:20.208 --> 06:38:20.218 align:start position:0%
critical one it's I don't like seeing
 
06:38:22.250 --> 06:38:22.260 align:start position:0%
any of these people released immediately
 
06:38:24.590 --> 06:38:24.600 align:start position:0%
and then going on to commit and one or
 
06:38:26.930 --> 06:38:26.940 align:start position:0%
two more crimes in the same day but we
 
06:38:29.090 --> 06:38:29.100 align:start position:0%
also need to be careful that we don't in
 
06:38:31.910 --> 06:38:31.920 align:start position:0%
reaction cause other problems either and
 
06:38:34.190 --> 06:38:34.200 align:start position:0%
I do know that the basically the Mandate
 
06:38:35.810 --> 06:38:35.820 align:start position:0%
of the house is that section 3 won't
 
06:38:37.970 --> 06:38:37.980 align:start position:0%
pass so if that is the case
 
06:38:37.980 --> 06:38:38.750 align:start position:0%
pass so if that is the case
um

06:38:38.750 --> 06:38:38.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:38:41.448 --> 06:38:41.458 align:start position:0%
representative Weber
 
06:38:44.090 --> 06:38:44.100 align:start position:0%
I would just add that although the vote
 
06:38:47.628 --> 06:38:47.638 align:start position:0%
in the house to request a committee of
 
06:38:53.208 --> 06:38:53.218 align:start position:0%
conference was uh 194 to 175.
 
06:38:53.218 --> 06:38:54.170 align:start position:0%
conference was uh 194 to 175.
um

06:38:54.170 --> 06:38:54.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:38:58.430 --> 06:38:58.440 align:start position:0%
that sounds overwhelmingly positive but
 
06:39:01.250 --> 06:39:01.260 align:start position:0%
the discussions that I have had with
 
06:39:04.730 --> 06:39:04.740 align:start position:0%
people are their desire to keep the
 
06:39:08.270 --> 06:39:08.280 align:start position:0%
original 610 alive and for many house
 
06:39:11.270 --> 06:39:11.280 align:start position:0%
members they were very disappointed that
 
06:39:13.850 --> 06:39:13.860 align:start position:0%
a completely unrelated bill from an
 
06:39:18.948 --> 06:39:18.958 align:start position:0%
unrelated committee was attached to a
 
06:39:21.770 --> 06:39:21.780 align:start position:0%
simple uncomplicated and very beneficial
 
06:39:23.750 --> 06:39:23.760 align:start position:0%
Bill and there was a lot of soul
 
06:39:25.270 --> 06:39:25.280 align:start position:0%
searching before
 
06:39:28.310 --> 06:39:28.320 align:start position:0%
uh on the part of the people who voted
 
06:39:29.868 --> 06:39:29.878 align:start position:0%
against a committee of conference but
 
06:39:32.708 --> 06:39:32.718 align:start position:0%
that was to keep the
 
06:39:37.310 --> 06:39:37.320 align:start position:0%
Cannabis Provisions alive and I think
 
06:39:37.320 --> 06:39:38.590 align:start position:0%
Cannabis Provisions alive and I think
that

06:39:38.590 --> 06:39:38.600 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:39:41.330 --> 06:39:41.340 align:start position:0%
the vote would not be that close if it
 
06:39:43.868 --> 06:39:43.878 align:start position:0%
was something else and and section three
 
06:39:46.368 --> 06:39:46.378 align:start position:0%
specifically was a no-go
 
06:39:49.070 --> 06:39:49.080 align:start position:0%
so I I don't want to waste people's time
 
06:39:51.410 --> 06:39:51.420 align:start position:0%
if if section three
 
06:39:54.288 --> 06:39:54.298 align:start position:0%
is the
 
06:39:58.730 --> 06:39:58.740 align:start position:0%
if section three is what's needed
 
06:40:01.730 --> 06:40:01.740 align:start position:0%
um I'm not entire I'm more than willing
 
06:40:04.430 --> 06:40:04.440 align:start position:0%
to give this more time but I don't think
 
06:40:06.650 --> 06:40:06.660 align:start position:0%
you're going to get a different result
 
06:40:08.448 --> 06:40:08.458 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to say something because I
 
06:40:10.548 --> 06:40:10.558 align:start position:0%
haven't up to this point but Section 3
 
06:40:12.350 --> 06:40:12.360 align:start position:0%
is the language from my bill Senate Bill
 
06:40:15.830 --> 06:40:15.840 align:start position:0%
252 and as the Senate President said on
 
06:40:17.390 --> 06:40:17.400 align:start position:0%
numerous occasions
 
06:40:19.970 --> 06:40:19.980 align:start position:0%
um this language similar language has
 
06:40:22.430 --> 06:40:22.440 align:start position:0%
been considered in the Senate
 
06:40:25.910 --> 06:40:25.920 align:start position:0%
um a couple thoughts number one is as we
 
06:40:29.150 --> 06:40:29.160 align:start position:0%
talk about this section yes bail reform
 
06:40:31.250 --> 06:40:31.260 align:start position:0%
talks about the individual that's been
 
06:40:34.910 --> 06:40:34.920 align:start position:0%
accused innocent obviously until proven
 
06:40:38.208 --> 06:40:38.218 align:start position:0%
guilty but none of this discussion ever
 
06:40:41.150 --> 06:40:41.160 align:start position:0%
seems to recognize that
 
06:40:43.850 --> 06:40:43.860 align:start position:0%
we've delineated certain crimes because
 
06:40:46.490 --> 06:40:46.500 align:start position:0%
these are victims and there are people
 
06:40:49.910 --> 06:40:49.920 align:start position:0%
on the other side and although we don't
 
06:40:52.368 --> 06:40:52.378 align:start position:0%
have a significant tracking mechanism
 
06:40:54.650 --> 06:40:54.660 align:start position:0%
which I hope we can get to I think we
 
06:40:57.830 --> 06:40:57.840 align:start position:0%
can all agree to that in section four
 
06:40:59.690 --> 06:40:59.700 align:start position:0%
um in the meantime
 
06:41:04.270 --> 06:41:04.280 align:start position:0%
people who have been victimized are then
 
06:41:07.610 --> 06:41:07.620 align:start position:0%
re-victimized because of a process that
 
06:41:10.250 --> 06:41:10.260 align:start position:0%
we have that we have not had the
 
06:41:13.548 --> 06:41:13.558 align:start position:0%
wherewithal to fix and that is my
 
06:41:16.010 --> 06:41:16.020 align:start position:0%
frustration here now the fact that this
 
06:41:18.110 --> 06:41:18.120 align:start position:0%
discussion is section three All or
 
06:41:20.090 --> 06:41:20.100 align:start position:0%
Nothing is probably even more
 
06:41:22.490 --> 06:41:22.500 align:start position:0%
infuriating if if you're willing to have
 
06:41:25.190 --> 06:41:25.200 align:start position:0%
a conversation about the crimes that are
 
06:41:28.070 --> 06:41:28.080 align:start position:0%
delineated and say the problem I have is
 
06:41:30.650 --> 06:41:30.660 align:start position:0%
with you know the first one listed or
 
06:41:33.288 --> 06:41:33.298 align:start position:0%
the last one listed I'm very happy to
 
06:41:35.810 --> 06:41:35.820 align:start position:0%
entertain those conversations but these
 
06:41:38.448 --> 06:41:38.458 align:start position:0%
were specifically selected because of
 
06:41:41.510 --> 06:41:41.520 align:start position:0%
the impact on victims and the fact that
 
06:41:44.150 --> 06:41:44.160 align:start position:0%
somebody who's accused of aggravated
 
06:41:47.330 --> 06:41:47.340 align:start position:0%
felonious sexual assault can walk out of
 
06:41:51.170 --> 06:41:51.180 align:start position:0%
a police station on PR bail before a
 
06:41:53.030 --> 06:41:53.040 align:start position:0%
detective has even had the ability to
 
06:41:55.070 --> 06:41:55.080 align:start position:0%
complete a report to get it to the bill
 
06:41:55.080 --> 06:41:56.330 align:start position:0%
complete a report to get it to the bill
commissioner

06:41:56.330 --> 06:41:56.340 align:start position:0%
commissioner
 
06:42:00.590 --> 06:42:00.600 align:start position:0%
that's on us and and that's not not the
 
06:42:03.590 --> 06:42:03.600 align:start position:0%
right circumstance now this bill doesn't
 
06:42:06.350 --> 06:42:06.360 align:start position:0%
purport to fix all of the problems they
 
06:42:08.990 --> 06:42:09.000 align:start position:0%
complement chairman Roy on looking at
 
06:42:11.208 --> 06:42:11.218 align:start position:0%
many of the others maybe it's the bail
 
06:42:13.430 --> 06:42:13.440 align:start position:0%
Commissioners maybe it's the magistrates
 
06:42:15.470 --> 06:42:15.480 align:start position:0%
I personally happen to think we need to
 
06:42:17.208 --> 06:42:17.218 align:start position:0%
go to a magistrate assistant
 
06:42:20.628 --> 06:42:20.638 align:start position:0%
but in the meantime people are being
 
06:42:23.690 --> 06:42:23.700 align:start position:0%
victimized and I just can't in good
 
06:42:25.510 --> 06:42:25.520 align:start position:0%
conscience say
 
06:42:27.530 --> 06:42:27.540 align:start position:0%
oh well
 
06:42:28.850 --> 06:42:28.860 align:start position:0%
um and it's the reason that I've been
 
06:42:30.830 --> 06:42:30.840 align:start position:0%
here advocating for this provision of
 
06:42:32.868 --> 06:42:32.878 align:start position:0%
the bill so as I said I'm I'm willing to
 
06:42:34.850 --> 06:42:34.860 align:start position:0%
entertain a discussion about pieces of
 
06:42:37.070 --> 06:42:37.080 align:start position:0%
it but to just say the whole thing is
 
06:42:37.080 --> 06:42:38.330 align:start position:0%
it but to just say the whole thing is
gone

06:42:38.330 --> 06:42:38.340 align:start position:0%
gone
 
06:42:41.090 --> 06:42:41.100 align:start position:0%
I'm just not ready to go there yet
 
06:42:41.100 --> 06:42:42.830 align:start position:0%
I'm just not ready to go there yet
representative

06:42:42.830 --> 06:42:42.840 align:start position:0%
representative
 
06:42:44.990 --> 06:42:45.000 align:start position:0%
um thank you um
 
06:42:47.990 --> 06:42:48.000 align:start position:0%
chairman and and thank you Senator
 
06:42:50.208 --> 06:42:50.218 align:start position:0%
um you bring up a good point I I think
 
06:42:52.970 --> 06:42:52.980 align:start position:0%
that um
 
06:42:55.430 --> 06:42:55.440 align:start position:0%
to the um the Senate president's Point
 
06:42:57.708 --> 06:42:57.718 align:start position:0%
into your point um we should take the
 
06:42:59.810 --> 06:42:59.820 align:start position:0%
time go back speak to our respective
 
06:42:59.820 --> 06:43:01.070 align:start position:0%
time go back speak to our respective
leadership

06:43:01.070 --> 06:43:01.080 align:start position:0%
leadership
 
06:43:03.288 --> 06:43:03.298 align:start position:0%
um I I'm willing to look at this and see
 
06:43:05.510 --> 06:43:05.520 align:start position:0%
if there's something that we can do with
 
06:43:08.208 --> 06:43:08.218 align:start position:0%
section three that would possibly pass
 
06:43:10.970 --> 06:43:10.980 align:start position:0%
um the body of the house give it a shot
 
06:43:14.930 --> 06:43:14.940 align:start position:0%
um as it stands as it's written it won't
 
06:43:17.090 --> 06:43:17.100 align:start position:0%
um but we could massage it look at it
 
06:43:18.230 --> 06:43:18.240 align:start position:0%
and see if there's something we can do
 
06:43:21.708 --> 06:43:21.718 align:start position:0%
as a stop Gap until we can deal with the
 
06:43:23.690 --> 06:43:23.700 align:start position:0%
comprehensive reform
 
06:43:26.570 --> 06:43:26.580 align:start position:0%
um I'm totally open to doing that
 
06:43:26.580 --> 06:43:29.330 align:start position:0%
um I'm totally open to doing that
so

06:43:29.330 --> 06:43:29.340 align:start position:0%
 
06:43:31.430 --> 06:43:31.440 align:start position:0%
I think what probably makes the most
 
06:43:33.288 --> 06:43:33.298 align:start position:0%
sense now would be to recess until
 
06:43:35.510 --> 06:43:35.520 align:start position:0%
tomorrow afternoon or when would be the
 
06:43:37.810 --> 06:43:37.820 align:start position:0%
best time for people to
 
06:43:39.890 --> 06:43:39.900 align:start position:0%
recessive then it would have to be after
 
06:43:44.090 --> 06:43:44.100 align:start position:0%
3 45 because of the 24 hour notice so
 
06:43:44.100 --> 06:43:45.350 align:start position:0%
3 45 because of the 24 hour notice so
um

06:43:45.350 --> 06:43:45.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:43:47.750 --> 06:43:47.760 align:start position:0%
does it have to be 24-hour notice if
 
06:43:49.610 --> 06:43:49.620 align:start position:0%
we're recessing from a Time certain to
 
06:43:51.470 --> 06:43:51.480 align:start position:0%
another time surgeon
 
06:43:54.350 --> 06:43:54.360 align:start position:0%
that I don't know what's that
 
06:43:58.128 --> 06:43:58.138 align:start position:0%
 
06:43:59.390 --> 06:43:59.400 align:start position:0%
a break
 
06:44:01.310 --> 06:44:01.320 align:start position:0%
so can we have a break and then
 
06:44:01.320 --> 06:44:02.930 align:start position:0%
so can we have a break and then
reconvene

06:44:02.930 --> 06:44:02.940 align:start position:0%
reconvene
 
06:44:05.510 --> 06:44:05.520 align:start position:0%
um some point tomorrow or how would that
 
06:44:07.430 --> 06:44:07.440 align:start position:0%
work I don't know the technicalities on
 
06:44:07.440 --> 06:44:08.510 align:start position:0%
work I don't know the technicalities on
this

06:44:08.510 --> 06:44:08.520 align:start position:0%
this
 
06:44:10.730 --> 06:44:10.740 align:start position:0%
I think you can recess to a Time certain
 
06:44:13.368 --> 06:44:13.378 align:start position:0%
yeah because some I mean you know in a
 
06:44:14.930 --> 06:44:14.940 align:start position:0%
committee or conference sometimes a
 
06:44:17.390 --> 06:44:17.400 align:start position:0%
recess for an hour recess for an hour or
 
06:44:19.368 --> 06:44:19.378 align:start position:0%
two hours yeah so I don't think that's a
 
06:44:21.470 --> 06:44:21.480 align:start position:0%
problem available later today if that's
 
06:44:21.480 --> 06:44:22.610 align:start position:0%
problem available later today if that's
helpful

06:44:22.610 --> 06:44:22.620 align:start position:0%
helpful
 
06:44:25.430 --> 06:44:25.440 align:start position:0%
um but I don't know what anybody else's
 
06:44:28.430 --> 06:44:28.440 align:start position:0%
schedule is like I'm also free on the
 
06:44:33.288 --> 06:44:33.298 align:start position:0%
20th but I want to make it clear that
 
06:44:33.298 --> 06:44:35.868 align:start position:0%
20th but I want to make it clear that
um

06:44:35.868 --> 06:44:35.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:44:35.878 --> 06:44:37.868 align:start position:0%
 
everyone

06:44:37.868 --> 06:44:37.878 align:start position:0%
everyone
 
06:44:40.750 --> 06:44:40.760 align:start position:0%
negotiating these
 
06:44:44.048 --> 06:44:44.058 align:start position:0%
various provisions of that
 
06:44:46.970 --> 06:44:46.980 align:start position:0%
in this forum rather than in a forum
 
06:44:50.150 --> 06:44:50.160 align:start position:0%
which would be a proper work session is
 
06:44:53.208 --> 06:44:53.218 align:start position:0%
very problematical for many of us in the
 
06:44:53.218 --> 06:44:54.650 align:start position:0%
very problematical for many of us in the
house

06:44:54.650 --> 06:44:54.660 align:start position:0%
house
 
06:44:54.660 --> 06:45:05.170 align:start position:0%
house
foreign

06:45:05.170 --> 06:45:05.180 align:start position:0%
 
06:45:08.390 --> 06:45:08.400 align:start position:0%
so I I just uh had advice given that um
 
06:45:10.128 --> 06:45:10.138 align:start position:0%
house rules now say that any recess
 
06:45:12.350 --> 06:45:12.360 align:start position:0%
needs to wait 12 hours
 
06:45:13.850 --> 06:45:13.860 align:start position:0%
um because of the time of day that we
 
06:45:16.010 --> 06:45:16.020 align:start position:0%
have I would not
 
06:45:17.990 --> 06:45:18.000 align:start position:0%
in other words you can't recess to go
 
06:45:20.930 --> 06:45:20.940 align:start position:0%
take a break in Pockets if you
 
06:45:22.910 --> 06:45:22.920 align:start position:0%
need to correct but because we won't be
 
06:45:25.548 --> 06:45:25.558 align:start position:0%
coming back before 3 45 a.m We would be
 
06:45:28.788 --> 06:45:28.798 align:start position:0%
safe to recess to tomorrow
 
06:45:28.798 --> 06:45:29.330 align:start position:0%
safe to recess to tomorrow
um

06:45:29.330 --> 06:45:29.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:45:29.340 --> 06:45:31.010 align:start position:0%
um
would

06:45:31.010 --> 06:45:31.020 align:start position:0%
would
 
06:45:33.650 --> 06:45:33.660 align:start position:0%
I guess time frame wise we need to see
 
06:45:37.010 --> 06:45:37.020 align:start position:0%
 
06:45:39.350 --> 06:45:39.360 align:start position:0%
three all day tomorrow I personally
 
06:45:41.090 --> 06:45:41.100 align:start position:0%
prefer to do it in the morning but okay
 
06:45:41.100 --> 06:45:44.708 align:start position:0%
prefer to do it in the morning but okay
yeah

06:45:44.708 --> 06:45:44.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:45:52.390 --> 06:45:52.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:45:55.670 --> 06:45:55.680 align:start position:0%
oh that's right
 
06:45:57.890 --> 06:45:57.900 align:start position:0%
has to be after two
 
06:45:57.900 --> 06:45:59.530 align:start position:0%
has to be after two
I

06:45:59.530 --> 06:45:59.540 align:start position:0%
I
 
06:46:03.410 --> 06:46:03.420 align:start position:0%
I can't do 3 30.
 
06:46:06.350 --> 06:46:06.360 align:start position:0%
um I I can do as long as I'm I'm out of
 
06:46:08.208 --> 06:46:08.218 align:start position:0%
here before or four with the time frame
 
06:46:09.530 --> 06:46:09.540 align:start position:0%
so earlier in the day would be better
 
06:46:11.208 --> 06:46:11.218 align:start position:0%
for me or Wednesday we could do that
 
06:46:14.890 --> 06:46:14.900 align:start position:0%
 
06:46:17.868 --> 06:46:17.878 align:start position:0%
I have we have a
 
06:46:20.570 --> 06:46:20.580 align:start position:0%
other Committee of conference at 11. so
 
06:46:22.670 --> 06:46:22.680 align:start position:0%
yeah and I know that
 
06:46:24.890 --> 06:46:24.900 align:start position:0%
um representative Palmer is available
 
06:46:28.190 --> 06:46:28.200 align:start position:0%
Wednesday tomorrow is booked okay okay
 
06:46:30.410 --> 06:46:30.420 align:start position:0%
so it looks like uh tomorrow is book
 
06:46:30.420 --> 06:46:31.490 align:start position:0%
so it looks like uh tomorrow is book
solid

06:46:31.490 --> 06:46:31.500 align:start position:0%
solid
 
06:46:31.500 --> 06:46:33.890 align:start position:0%
solid
um

06:46:33.890 --> 06:46:33.900 align:start position:0%
 
06:46:33.900 --> 06:46:35.628 align:start position:0%
 
Wednesday

06:46:35.628 --> 06:46:35.638 align:start position:0%
Wednesday
 
06:46:35.638 --> 06:46:38.030 align:start position:0%
Wednesday
um

06:46:38.030 --> 06:46:38.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:46:40.368 --> 06:46:40.378 align:start position:0%
nine o'clock we
 
06:46:42.368 --> 06:46:42.378 align:start position:0%
I believe I could make nine o'clock work
 
06:46:46.548 --> 06:46:46.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:46:46.558 --> 06:46:53.110 align:start position:0%
 
um

06:46:53.110 --> 06:46:53.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:46:56.690 --> 06:46:56.700 align:start position:0%
so that gives us
 
06:46:56.700 --> 06:47:01.610 align:start position:0%
so that gives us
okay

06:47:01.610 --> 06:47:01.620 align:start position:0%
 
06:47:01.620 --> 06:47:02.530 align:start position:0%
 
okay

06:47:02.530 --> 06:47:02.540 align:start position:0%
okay
 
06:47:06.230 --> 06:47:06.240 align:start position:0%
it's hard enough okay so uh we will
 
06:47:08.390 --> 06:47:08.400 align:start position:0%
sadly need to replace you but uh better
 
06:47:09.830 --> 06:47:09.840 align:start position:0%
than to pull you away from work when
 
06:47:12.650 --> 06:47:12.660 align:start position:0%
you're needed one question yes put your
 
06:47:12.660 --> 06:47:13.628 align:start position:0%
you're needed one question yes put your
microphone

06:47:13.628 --> 06:47:13.638 align:start position:0%
microphone
 
06:47:16.490 --> 06:47:16.500 align:start position:0%
as I was looking through the testimony
 
06:47:21.468 --> 06:47:21.478 align:start position:0%
on um hb2 or SB 252
 
06:47:23.330 --> 06:47:23.340 align:start position:0%
um there was
 
06:47:25.730 --> 06:47:25.740 align:start position:0%
the a lot of different people had
 
06:47:25.740 --> 06:47:27.590 align:start position:0%
the a lot of different people had
contributed

06:47:27.590 --> 06:47:27.600 align:start position:0%
contributed
 
06:47:29.448 --> 06:47:29.458 align:start position:0%
and there was some question in my mind
 
06:47:32.628 --> 06:47:32.638 align:start position:0%
after read it whether whether this this
 
06:47:34.788 --> 06:47:34.798 align:start position:0%
language actually would
 
06:47:39.048 --> 06:47:39.058 align:start position:0%
um solve the problem and so if I were
 
06:47:41.810 --> 06:47:41.820 align:start position:0%
coming back what that I would you know
 
06:47:44.448 --> 06:47:44.458 align:start position:0%
if there's if there's more evidence
 
06:47:46.788 --> 06:47:46.798 align:start position:0%
I like I like evidence if there's more
 
06:47:48.110 --> 06:47:48.120 align:start position:0%
evidence that this really would solve
 
06:47:49.490 --> 06:47:49.500 align:start position:0%
the problem rather than something a
 
06:47:51.048 --> 06:47:51.058 align:start position:0%
little more comprehensive I know you've
 
06:47:54.468 --> 06:47:54.478 align:start position:0%
made very strong uh case for this
 
06:47:57.170 --> 06:47:57.180 align:start position:0%
particular section but there was some
 
06:47:58.788 --> 06:47:58.798 align:start position:0%
testimony that questioned whether this
 
06:48:00.890 --> 06:48:00.900 align:start position:0%
would actually solve the problem that
 
06:48:02.208 --> 06:48:02.218 align:start position:0%
we're talking about about keeping
 
06:48:05.030 --> 06:48:05.040 align:start position:0%
violent people on the street
 
06:48:06.650 --> 06:48:06.660 align:start position:0%
um so if there's any more information
 
06:48:06.660 --> 06:48:10.190 align:start position:0%
um so if there's any more information
available

06:48:10.190 --> 06:48:10.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:48:14.030 --> 06:48:14.040 align:start position:0%
so I just in response to that say that
 
06:48:16.788 --> 06:48:16.798 align:start position:0%
over the last three years I think this
 
06:48:19.430 --> 06:48:19.440 align:start position:0%
language has been refined to take the
 
06:48:22.490 --> 06:48:22.500 align:start position:0%
most surgical approach to the most
 
06:48:26.690 --> 06:48:26.700 align:start position:0%
egregious violent crimes and
 
06:48:26.700 --> 06:48:27.968 align:start position:0%
egregious violent crimes and
um

06:48:27.968 --> 06:48:27.978 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:48:31.670 --> 06:48:31.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:48:35.750 --> 06:48:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:48:38.330 --> 06:48:38.340 align:start position:0%
folks like myself who support it but
 
06:48:40.730 --> 06:48:40.740 align:start position:0%
then you know opponents of it the
 
06:48:43.250 --> 06:48:43.260 align:start position:0%
surgical approach focusing on the most
 
06:48:45.468 --> 06:48:45.478 align:start position:0%
violent crime seems to be something that
 
06:48:47.930 --> 06:48:47.940 align:start position:0%
we ought to be able to unify around so
 
06:48:49.368 --> 06:48:49.378 align:start position:0%
that's why
 
06:48:53.930 --> 06:48:53.940 align:start position:0%
 
06:48:55.548 --> 06:48:55.558 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
06:48:57.890 --> 06:48:57.900 align:start position:0%
Madam chair I'll make sure that the
 
06:49:01.730 --> 06:49:01.740 align:start position:0%
amendment on the bail track or financing
 
06:49:04.788 --> 06:49:04.798 align:start position:0%
is distributed thank you very much
 
06:49:06.530 --> 06:49:06.540 align:start position:0%
thank you and with that we'll recess
