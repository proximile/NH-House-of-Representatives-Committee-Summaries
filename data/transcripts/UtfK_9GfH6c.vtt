hearing for uh HB
 
00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:54.440 align:start position:0%
366 uh this is a bill relative to school
 
00:04:58.350 --> 00:04:58.360 align:start position:0%
building aid for eligible projects and
 
00:05:01.629 --> 00:05:01.639 align:start position:0%
um I'd like to welcome represent kahill
 
00:05:04.189 --> 00:05:04.199 align:start position:0%
here uh he has been a frequent flyer on
 
00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:07.520 align:start position:0%
building Aid projects in past years so
 
00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:09.120 align:start position:0%
welcome to our committee thank you very
 
00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:12.280 align:start position:0%
much Mr chair and and I I do appreciate
 
00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:13.960 align:start position:0%
you being my
 
00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:16.360 align:start position:0%
wingman um it's an important issue I I
 
00:05:17.909 --> 00:05:17.919 align:start position:0%
do wanted to ask you about the pledge
 
00:05:19.309 --> 00:05:19.319 align:start position:0%
are we going to begin with the pledge
 
00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:21.080 align:start position:0%
first or no we're going to go right
 
00:05:22.469 --> 00:05:22.479 align:start position:0%
ahead with the meeting all right I'm
 
00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:27.800 align:start position:0%
ready then okay so um as you've said uh
 
00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:31.400 align:start position:0%
this has been a long-standing issue
 
00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:33.400 align:start position:0%
I think it was problematic before the
 
00:05:36.189 --> 00:05:36.199 align:start position:0%
moratorium before the Great Recession
 
00:05:38.469 --> 00:05:38.479 align:start position:0%
but it has certainly gotten worse with
 
00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:41.120 align:start position:0%
all that 10 years of not accepting
 
00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:44.240 align:start position:0%
applications not uh meeting the need
 
00:05:45.749 --> 00:05:45.759 align:start position:0%
that's out there in our traditional
 
00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:50.000 align:start position:0%
public schools and so I I've uh what I'd
 
00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:52.080 align:start position:0%
like to do and I know we I know uh
 
00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:53.680 align:start position:0%
chairman lad agrees with me that we
 
00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:55.720 align:start position:0%
should probably ask for a 100 million
 
00:05:58.070 --> 00:05:58.080 align:start position:0%
but I don't think we get it uh so what
 
00:06:01.749 --> 00:06:01.759 align:start position:0%
I'd like to do is is change the Min the
 
00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:04.400 align:start position:0%
maximum 50 million per fiscal year to a
 
00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:05.680 align:start position:0%
minimum of
 
00:06:09.029 --> 00:06:09.039 align:start position:0%
60 and this would allow you know if we
 
00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:12.720 align:start position:0%
if we do run into Good Times uh a future
 
00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:16.840 align:start position:0%
legislature could add more perhaps 65
 
00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:19.880 align:start position:0%
6750 uh whatever whatever they could uh
 
00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:22.120 align:start position:0%
put toward this uh School building aid
 
00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:24.280 align:start position:0%
program so that we might begin to chip
 
00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:27.720 align:start position:0%
away at the estimated $200 million
 
00:06:31.589 --> 00:06:31.599 align:start position:0%
backlog out there across our state uh
 
00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:33.560 align:start position:0%
the other part that's uh of interest to
 
00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:37.680 align:start position:0%
me is the uh the schools that really
 
00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:39.560 align:start position:0%
were forced to act during the moratorium
 
00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:41.680 align:start position:0%
I I know there was no promise to fund
 
00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:43.280 align:start position:0%
actually the applications were not
 
00:06:45.390 --> 00:06:45.400 align:start position:0%
accepted because there was no money and
 
00:06:46.749 --> 00:06:46.759 align:start position:0%
they didn't want to use the resources
 
00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:49.880 align:start position:0%
trying to uh evaluate the applications
 
00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:53.120 align:start position:0%
when there was no money but
 
00:06:55.670 --> 00:06:55.680 align:start position:0%
um and I know there was discussion about
 
00:06:57.189 --> 00:06:57.199 align:start position:0%
putting your you know with with the
 
00:06:59.309 --> 00:06:59.319 align:start position:0%
state Bond you know putting your visa on
 
00:07:02.309 --> 00:07:02.319 align:start position:0%
your Discover card but it ended up on
 
00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:05.000 align:start position:0%
the Discover Cards and Visa cards and
 
00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:08.080 align:start position:0%
property tax bills in those communities
 
00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:11.440 align:start position:0%
and I've included uh in in the documents
 
00:07:13.670 --> 00:07:13.680 align:start position:0%
I've included the list of those people
 
00:07:15.189 --> 00:07:15.199 align:start position:0%
that acted and there could be more this
 
00:07:17.909 --> 00:07:17.919 align:start position:0%
is hasn't been updated these uh those
 
00:07:20.309 --> 00:07:20.319 align:start position:0%
communities spent uh
 
00:07:23.670 --> 00:07:23.680 align:start position:0%
537 milon
 
00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:26.189 align:start position:0%
537 milon
174,175

00:07:26.189 --> 00:07:26.199 align:start position:0%
174,175
 
00:07:30.029 --> 00:07:30.039 align:start position:0%
uh on their schools and the state had it
 
00:07:32.790 --> 00:07:32.800 align:start position:0%
been uh contributing this the share
 
00:07:34.110 --> 00:07:34.120 align:start position:0%
would have spent
 
00:07:59.629 --> 00:07:59.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:03.029 --> 00:08:03.039 align:start position:0%
in our tool aged and uh insufficient
 
00:08:05.350 --> 00:08:05.360 align:start position:0%
school buildings added
 
00:08:09.469 --> 00:08:09.479 align:start position:0%
$3.15 to our already high property taxes
 
00:08:11.710 --> 00:08:11.720 align:start position:0%
and as you know property taxes keep on
 
00:08:13.749 --> 00:08:13.759 align:start position:0%
going up especially with the re
 
00:08:16.309 --> 00:08:16.319 align:start position:0%
reassessment so it's it's a burden it's
 
00:08:19.149 --> 00:08:19.159 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a burden and it's the state
 
00:08:21.670 --> 00:08:21.680 align:start position:0%
should share in this we have a
 
00:08:23.469 --> 00:08:23.479 align:start position:0%
constitutional obligation to provide an
 
00:08:25.670 --> 00:08:25.680 align:start position:0%
adequate education that to me means an
 
00:08:27.670 --> 00:08:27.680 align:start position:0%
adequate building a building without
 
00:08:30.110 --> 00:08:30.120 align:start position:0%
Fire and Life Safety hazards a building
 
00:08:33.550 --> 00:08:33.560 align:start position:0%
with sufficient space uh a building
 
00:08:35.829 --> 00:08:35.839 align:start position:0%
which the doesn't have modular a school
 
00:08:37.269 --> 00:08:37.279 align:start position:0%
doesn't have modular
 
00:08:39.029 --> 00:08:39.039 align:start position:0%
classrooms and yet we're we're
 
00:08:42.550 --> 00:08:42.560 align:start position:0%
installing more modulars I I read about
 
00:08:45.190 --> 00:08:45.200 align:start position:0%
um down in Londoner where they tried
 
00:08:47.269 --> 00:08:47.279 align:start position:0%
they couldn't pass the bond last time
 
00:08:48.829 --> 00:08:48.839 align:start position:0%
last year so now they're offering a
 
00:08:51.110 --> 00:08:51.120 align:start position:0%
scaled back plan uh where they're going
 
00:08:52.790 --> 00:08:52.800 align:start position:0%
to use modulars which they think will
 
00:08:55.430 --> 00:08:55.440 align:start position:0%
solve their problem for 15 years and
 
00:08:57.030 --> 00:08:57.040 align:start position:0%
then then I guess they'll have to come
 
00:08:58.949 --> 00:08:58.959 align:start position:0%
back because they have to they have to
 
00:09:01.269 --> 00:09:01.279 align:start position:0%
get a cheap cheaper cheaper cheaper so
 
00:09:03.310 --> 00:09:03.320 align:start position:0%
they can might be able to reach the 60%
 
00:09:05.350 --> 00:09:05.360 align:start position:0%
threshold again because the state is not
 
00:09:09.150 --> 00:09:09.160 align:start position:0%
a partner uh London there I note uh got
 
00:09:12.509 --> 00:09:12.519 align:start position:0%
a u they're anticipating a uh sneaker
 
00:09:14.910 --> 00:09:14.920 align:start position:0%
Factory part of this restoring
 
00:09:17.030 --> 00:09:17.040 align:start position:0%
manufacturing and that sneaker Factory
 
00:09:20.190 --> 00:09:20.200 align:start position:0%
got a $70 million Bond through the
 
00:09:23.389 --> 00:09:23.399 align:start position:0%
BFA now public schools don't have that
 
00:09:25.790 --> 00:09:25.800 align:start position:0%
option you know we're encouraging
 
00:09:28.389 --> 00:09:28.399 align:start position:0%
business but we're not investing in and
 
00:09:31.350 --> 00:09:31.360 align:start position:0%
encouraging our traditional Public
 
00:09:34.710 --> 00:09:34.720 align:start position:0%
Schools um another piece of paper that
 
00:09:38.670 --> 00:09:38.680 align:start position:0%
I've provided to you is the uh School
 
00:09:40.990 --> 00:09:41.000 align:start position:0%
building Aid weight list as you know we
 
00:09:45.990 --> 00:09:46.000 align:start position:0%
have a rank list now and there were 17
 
00:09:49.550 --> 00:09:49.560 align:start position:0%
applicants and we funded three leaving
 
00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:50.750 align:start position:0%
applicants and we funded three leaving
14

00:09:50.750 --> 00:09:50.760 align:start position:0%
14
 
00:09:54.269 --> 00:09:54.279 align:start position:0%
more now I I the number here at the
 
00:09:56.790 --> 00:09:56.800 align:start position:0%
bottom I did calculate the enrollment
 
00:09:58.870 --> 00:09:58.880 align:start position:0%
and what I'm seeing here on the page in
 
00:10:01.550 --> 00:10:01.560 align:start position:0%
front of me is 8,028 students I thought
 
00:10:04.190 --> 00:10:04.200 align:start position:0%
it was 7,000 but anyway there's a lot of
 
00:10:06.910 --> 00:10:06.920 align:start position:0%
students even more than those using the
 
00:10:09.509 --> 00:10:09.519 align:start position:0%
EFA that are waiting for the state to
 
00:10:12.590 --> 00:10:12.600 align:start position:0%
step up and help fix their
 
00:10:15.590 --> 00:10:15.600 align:start position:0%
schools uh if you have a if if one of
 
00:10:19.110 --> 00:10:19.120 align:start position:0%
you one or one of you has a school in uh
 
00:10:22.750 --> 00:10:22.760 align:start position:0%
on this list or that list you might want
 
00:10:25.550 --> 00:10:25.560 align:start position:0%
to help to vote to pass this bill and
 
00:10:26.910 --> 00:10:26.920 align:start position:0%
even if you don't you should because
 
00:10:29.790 --> 00:10:29.800 align:start position:0%
it's the right thing um I sent you a
 
00:10:32.350 --> 00:10:32.360 align:start position:0%
link to the
 
00:10:35.150 --> 00:10:35.160 align:start position:0%
uh that's the other Bill anyway the the
 
00:10:38.110 --> 00:10:38.120 align:start position:0%
point I'm trying to make is that we we
 
00:10:40.190 --> 00:10:40.200 align:start position:0%
we need to invest in our
 
00:10:42.910 --> 00:10:42.920 align:start position:0%
schools and in order to ensure that
 
00:10:45.269 --> 00:10:45.279 align:start position:0%
people have an adequate education maybe
 
00:10:47.389 --> 00:10:47.399 align:start position:0%
even better than adequate that should be
 
00:10:50.030 --> 00:10:50.040 align:start position:0%
our goal but we need to do it and we
 
00:10:52.190 --> 00:10:52.200 align:start position:0%
need to we can't keep on kicking the can
 
00:10:55.269 --> 00:10:55.279 align:start position:0%
down the road further and
 
00:10:57.509 --> 00:10:57.519 align:start position:0%
further thank you very much thank you
 
00:10:58.790 --> 00:10:58.800 align:start position:0%
very much are there questions for
 
00:11:01.389 --> 00:11:01.399 align:start position:0%
represent kill yes represent Maguire
 
00:11:02.750 --> 00:11:02.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
00:11:05.790 --> 00:11:05.800 align:start position:0%
taking my question as you know um School
 
00:11:07.910 --> 00:11:07.920 align:start position:0%
building Aid is very chunky right
 
00:11:10.509 --> 00:11:10.519 align:start position:0%
certain a handful of schools get it and
 
00:11:13.670 --> 00:11:13.680 align:start position:0%
and the rest don't would you be
 
00:11:16.629 --> 00:11:16.639 align:start position:0%
in how would you think about a system
 
00:11:21.150 --> 00:11:21.160 align:start position:0%
that changed it so that um a uh whatever
 
00:11:22.870 --> 00:11:22.880 align:start position:0%
the money is that's allocated that
 
00:11:24.829 --> 00:11:24.839 align:start position:0%
particular year 50 million whatever the
 
00:11:29.389 --> 00:11:29.399 align:start position:0%
number is was given as adequacy to all
 
00:11:32.230 --> 00:11:32.240 align:start position:0%
districts that they could put in escrow
 
00:11:34.990 --> 00:11:35.000 align:start position:0%
or use for repairs or whatever so that
 
00:11:39.389 --> 00:11:39.399 align:start position:0%
they would all have a fund for building
 
00:11:42.750 --> 00:11:42.760 align:start position:0%
schools uh that's an interesting
 
00:11:45.910 --> 00:11:45.920 align:start position:0%
proposition um I I recall there was a
 
00:11:47.750 --> 00:11:47.760 align:start position:0%
bill put forward from the other chamber
 
00:11:49.870 --> 00:11:49.880 align:start position:0%
last year to allow it to provide a
 
00:11:51.790 --> 00:11:51.800 align:start position:0%
certain amount of money every year to
 
00:11:53.629 --> 00:11:53.639 align:start position:0%
all the schools and they would save up
 
00:11:57.069 --> 00:11:57.079 align:start position:0%
and save up and save up which I I don't
 
00:11:59.310 --> 00:11:59.320 align:start position:0%
think that was going to work uh we don't
 
00:12:01.190 --> 00:12:01.200 align:start position:0%
we don't often save up for our homes or
 
00:12:03.550 --> 00:12:03.560 align:start position:0%
our cars and and they don't cost quite
 
00:12:07.190 --> 00:12:07.200 align:start position:0%
as much as a school building or or often
 
00:12:10.470 --> 00:12:10.480 align:start position:0%
repairs uh let let me bring up another
 
00:12:12.389 --> 00:12:12.399 align:start position:0%
another area of the reform that happened
 
00:12:15.829 --> 00:12:15.839 align:start position:0%
in 2013 on sh the chairman lad remembers
 
00:12:18.790 --> 00:12:18.800 align:start position:0%
we used to pay building Aid out in
 
00:12:22.269 --> 00:12:22.279 align:start position:0%
conjunction with the local Bond it a
 
00:12:24.269 --> 00:12:24.279 align:start position:0%
long range set 20 years 30 years
 
00:12:26.670 --> 00:12:26.680 align:start position:0%
whatever but we paid along with that and
 
00:12:28.790 --> 00:12:28.800 align:start position:0%
then it was a change made where we'd say
 
00:12:30.350 --> 00:12:30.360 align:start position:0%
in order the save everybody some
 
00:12:34.189 --> 00:12:34.199 align:start position:0%
interest we would pay 80% upfront and
 
00:12:36.949 --> 00:12:36.959 align:start position:0%
20% upon completion that's a big chunk
 
00:12:39.790 --> 00:12:39.800 align:start position:0%
of money in a short period of time and
 
00:12:41.750 --> 00:12:41.760 align:start position:0%
that's part of why we can't approve more
 
00:12:44.990 --> 00:12:45.000 align:start position:0%
than three schools in the bium because
 
00:12:47.829 --> 00:12:47.839 align:start position:0%
we're laying out so much money for one
 
00:12:51.629 --> 00:12:51.639 align:start position:0%
school maybe two and I think that's
 
00:12:53.550 --> 00:12:53.560 align:start position:0%
that's something we need to examine
 
00:12:55.110 --> 00:12:55.120 align:start position:0%
because it it contributes to this
 
00:12:57.629 --> 00:12:57.639 align:start position:0%
problem go not enough money and too much
 
00:13:00.189 --> 00:13:00.199 align:start position:0%
all at once
 
00:13:01.910 --> 00:13:01.920 align:start position:0%
thank you further questions yes
 
00:13:04.150 --> 00:13:04.160 align:start position:0%
representative luno thank you very much
 
00:13:05.350 --> 00:13:05.360 align:start position:0%
Mr chair thank you very much
 
00:13:07.030 --> 00:13:07.040 align:start position:0%
representative kale for uh for bringing
 
00:13:09.310 --> 00:13:09.320 align:start position:0%
this forward I was I was wondering if we
 
00:13:12.150 --> 00:13:12.160 align:start position:0%
could um if you could sort of step back
 
00:13:14.870 --> 00:13:14.880 align:start position:0%
from this just uh just for a little bit
 
00:13:17.870 --> 00:13:17.880 align:start position:0%
and I know how close you are to the to
 
00:13:20.470 --> 00:13:20.480 align:start position:0%
you know uh building Aid proposals and
 
00:13:21.910 --> 00:13:21.920 align:start position:0%
and bills that are that are brought
 
00:13:24.350 --> 00:13:24.360 align:start position:0%
forward and if you could spend a minute
 
00:13:26.310 --> 00:13:26.320 align:start position:0%
and give the committee maybe a highle
 
00:13:30.069 --> 00:13:30.079 align:start position:0%
flyover of other bills um
 
00:13:34.150 --> 00:13:34.160 align:start position:0%
that would relate to um to building Aid
 
00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:34.949 align:start position:0%
that would relate to um to building Aid
and

00:13:34.949 --> 00:13:34.959 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:13:37.230 --> 00:13:37.240 align:start position:0%
appropriate you know similar amounts in
 
00:13:40.110 --> 00:13:40.120 align:start position:0%
similar ways to what you've got proposed
 
00:13:42.269 --> 00:13:42.279 align:start position:0%
here I'm just wondering what we've got
 
00:13:44.670 --> 00:13:44.680 align:start position:0%
what we'll be seeing on the tape on the
 
00:13:48.670 --> 00:13:48.680 align:start position:0%
proverbial table U this session well I I
 
00:13:50.590 --> 00:13:50.600 align:start position:0%
know that right up after this we'll talk
 
00:13:54.069 --> 00:13:54.079 align:start position:0%
about uh repealing the bill that would
 
00:13:56.310 --> 00:13:56.320 align:start position:0%
the bill that allowed uh charter schools
 
00:13:58.150 --> 00:13:58.160 align:start position:0%
to be eligible which I see as a further
 
00:14:01.350 --> 00:14:01.360 align:start position:0%
drain on our very limited funds and I
 
00:14:02.790 --> 00:14:02.800 align:start position:0%
think in another week or two we'll be
 
00:14:05.389 --> 00:14:05.399 align:start position:0%
talking about my my other bill which
 
00:14:07.110 --> 00:14:07.120 align:start position:0%
would be repeal the bill that gave
 
00:14:09.389 --> 00:14:09.399 align:start position:0%
charter schools first refusal on
 
00:14:11.350 --> 00:14:11.360 align:start position:0%
unoccupied school buildings which I
 
00:14:14.509 --> 00:14:14.519 align:start position:0%
think removes the right of uh the people
 
00:14:16.509 --> 00:14:16.519 align:start position:0%
in the community to decide what is best
 
00:14:19.110 --> 00:14:19.120 align:start position:0%
for them and sort of it's kind of a
 
00:14:20.829 --> 00:14:20.839 align:start position:0%
statist approach to just sort of you
 
00:14:22.470 --> 00:14:22.480 align:start position:0%
will do this with that
 
00:14:26.990 --> 00:14:27.000 align:start position:0%
building um uh so there's a long there's
 
00:14:29.430 --> 00:14:29.440 align:start position:0%
a long history with with the building
 
00:14:32.230 --> 00:14:32.240 align:start position:0%
started in the 40s that was before my
 
00:14:35.230 --> 00:14:35.240 align:start position:0%
time and uh I know we have other bills
 
00:14:37.829 --> 00:14:37.839 align:start position:0%
talking about uh 550 talking about
 
00:14:40.550 --> 00:14:40.560 align:start position:0%
giving more money per student I don't
 
00:14:42.230 --> 00:14:42.240 align:start position:0%
think that necessarily I don't think
 
00:14:47.150 --> 00:14:47.160 align:start position:0%
that gets to building Aid and um but I I
 
00:14:49.150 --> 00:14:49.160 align:start position:0%
guess to the I do have a follow question
 
00:14:50.910 --> 00:14:50.920 align:start position:0%
just just a
 
00:14:53.150 --> 00:14:53.160 align:start position:0%
clarification just um are there are
 
00:14:54.670 --> 00:14:54.680 align:start position:0%
there any other bills that you're aware
 
00:14:57.949 --> 00:14:57.959 align:start position:0%
of that have a similar uh framework to
 
00:15:01.310 --> 00:15:01.320 align:start position:0%
this where where it's it's you know um
 
00:15:04.389 --> 00:15:04.399 align:start position:0%
making a um an appropriation to the uh
 
00:15:06.189 --> 00:15:06.199 align:start position:0%
to the building aid program whether it's
 
00:15:08.310 --> 00:15:08.320 align:start position:0%
$50 million or $60 million okay I'm
 
00:15:09.590 --> 00:15:09.600 align:start position:0%
going to interject on that question
 
00:15:10.749 --> 00:15:10.759 align:start position:0%
because I want to explain to the
 
00:15:11.910 --> 00:15:11.920 align:start position:0%
committee what we are going to do this
 
00:15:13.310 --> 00:15:13.320 align:start position:0%
year we have a number of bills coming up
 
00:15:15.189 --> 00:15:15.199 align:start position:0%
catastrophic Aid we have special
 
00:15:17.509 --> 00:15:17.519 align:start position:0%
education Aid we have school Foundation
 
00:15:20.110 --> 00:15:20.120 align:start position:0%
formula we have building Aid we will be
 
00:15:22.350 --> 00:15:22.360 align:start position:0%
having work sessions in all these in
 
00:15:24.910 --> 00:15:24.920 align:start position:0%
terms of what formula we have is there
 
00:15:27.230 --> 00:15:27.240 align:start position:0%
another formula available that might
 
00:15:29.550 --> 00:15:29.560 align:start position:0%
expedite or make it more
 
00:15:31.829 --> 00:15:31.839 align:start position:0%
or be more palatable in terms of the
 
00:15:34.110 --> 00:15:34.120 align:start position:0%
economics associated with it so the
 
00:15:35.949 --> 00:15:35.959 align:start position:0%
question you're asking that I would say
 
00:15:37.870 --> 00:15:37.880 align:start position:0%
yes we'll use one of these bills there
 
00:15:39.069 --> 00:15:39.079 align:start position:0%
were a number of bills which weren't
 
00:15:40.949 --> 00:15:40.959 align:start position:0%
submitted on building a simply because
 
00:15:43.990 --> 00:15:44.000 align:start position:0%
we only needed one to open up Pandora's
 
00:15:47.710 --> 00:15:47.720 align:start position:0%
Box and so um that's thank you Mr chair
 
00:15:49.629 --> 00:15:49.639 align:start position:0%
that's exactly what I was getting at so
 
00:15:51.590 --> 00:15:51.600 align:start position:0%
that so that we're we're looking at all
 
00:15:53.990 --> 00:15:54.000 align:start position:0%
these bills as as a whole this thank are
 
00:15:55.069 --> 00:15:55.079 align:start position:0%
there any further questions for
 
00:15:58.350 --> 00:15:58.360 align:start position:0%
represent kahill yes represent papovich
 
00:15:59.749 --> 00:15:59.759 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
00:16:02.309 --> 00:16:02.319 align:start position:0%
representative for taking the
 
00:16:05.189 --> 00:16:05.199 align:start position:0%
question in your opinion does building
 
00:16:07.870 --> 00:16:07.880 align:start position:0%
aate historically get spread around to
 
00:16:11.590 --> 00:16:11.600 align:start position:0%
all towns or is it U you know tends to
 
00:16:14.150 --> 00:16:14.160 align:start position:0%
be clustered in certain towns and if
 
00:16:16.990 --> 00:16:17.000 align:start position:0%
that second scenario is the case do you
 
00:16:19.030 --> 00:16:19.040 align:start position:0%
find that to be Equitable to everybody
 
00:16:21.870 --> 00:16:21.880 align:start position:0%
in the state thank you for the question
 
00:16:26.430 --> 00:16:26.440 align:start position:0%
as I I'm aware that it is difficult in a
 
00:16:30.150 --> 00:16:30.160 align:start position:0%
town to get 60% of the vote to do
 
00:16:33.230 --> 00:16:33.240 align:start position:0%
anything and I know that if you if the
 
00:16:36.509 --> 00:16:36.519 align:start position:0%
town has fewer resources that the
 
00:16:39.870 --> 00:16:39.880 align:start position:0%
building a program offers more a more
 
00:16:39.880 --> 00:16:40.990 align:start position:0%
building a program offers more a more
generous

00:16:40.990 --> 00:16:41.000 align:start position:0%
generous
 
00:16:43.509 --> 00:16:43.519 align:start position:0%
portion uh up to
 
00:16:46.749 --> 00:16:46.759 align:start position:0%
60% uh to make it to help enable those
 
00:16:48.470 --> 00:16:48.480 align:start position:0%
poorer communities so I think that's a
 
00:16:51.389 --> 00:16:51.399 align:start position:0%
good step that we has have historically
 
00:16:56.269 --> 00:16:56.279 align:start position:0%
taken um and and I know that uh when
 
00:16:59.150 --> 00:16:59.160 align:start position:0%
when the state was a reliable partner
 
00:17:01.110 --> 00:17:01.120 align:start position:0%
and the money was available and we could
 
00:17:03.710 --> 00:17:03.720 align:start position:0%
approve these projects schools were
 
00:17:07.230 --> 00:17:07.240 align:start position:0%
getting done uh it's unfortunate that
 
00:17:10.590 --> 00:17:10.600 align:start position:0%
for example uh my my friend um
 
00:17:11.949 --> 00:17:11.959 align:start position:0%
representative cluder will might tell
 
00:17:14.350 --> 00:17:14.360 align:start position:0%
you about the uh situation in Claremont
 
00:17:16.789 --> 00:17:16.799 align:start position:0%
at the Stevens High School where it fell
 
00:17:21.590 --> 00:17:21.600 align:start position:0%
one vote shy of that 60 60% majority and
 
00:17:24.470 --> 00:17:24.480 align:start position:0%
that Pro that offering uh with building
 
00:17:27.390 --> 00:17:27.400 align:start position:0%
a available uh was not approved and a
 
00:17:29.590 --> 00:17:29.600 align:start position:0%
couple years later they came back
 
00:17:32.669 --> 00:17:32.679 align:start position:0%
with a smaller smaller project and guess
 
00:17:36.150 --> 00:17:36.160 align:start position:0%
what no money from the state so you have
 
00:17:37.789 --> 00:17:37.799 align:start position:0%
you have to wonder sometimes whether or
 
00:17:40.350 --> 00:17:40.360 align:start position:0%
not we're doing the best thing we can
 
00:17:43.350 --> 00:17:43.360 align:start position:0%
and I I don't think we are and by the
 
00:17:45.870 --> 00:17:45.880 align:start position:0%
way Windam is on that retroactive
 
00:17:47.990 --> 00:17:48.000 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee not
 
00:17:49.669 --> 00:17:49.679 align:start position:0%
seeing any thank you very much thank you
 
00:17:57.029 --> 00:17:57.039 align:start position:0%

00:18:03.270 --> 00:18:03.280 align:start position:0%
committee and I will be brief I have a
 
00:18:05.590 --> 00:18:05.600 align:start position:0%
meeting at 10: so I can stay for just a
 
00:18:07.510 --> 00:18:07.520 align:start position:0%
few minutes to testify and answer
 
00:18:09.430 --> 00:18:09.440 align:start position:0%
questions for the record I'm state
 
00:18:11.630 --> 00:18:11.640 align:start position:0%
representative John claer from Sullivan
 
00:18:13.909 --> 00:18:13.919 align:start position:0%
County district 6 which comprises the
 
00:18:17.789 --> 00:18:17.799 align:start position:0%
communities of of cin and Claremont uh
 
00:18:20.029 --> 00:18:20.039 align:start position:0%
and I live in Claremont just to be clear
 
00:18:21.990 --> 00:18:22.000 align:start position:0%
but I did want to Enlighten you as the
 
00:18:23.669 --> 00:18:23.679 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor just touched on the issue
 
00:18:25.510 --> 00:18:25.520 align:start position:0%
in Claremont dealing with Stevens High
 
00:18:28.070 --> 00:18:28.080 align:start position:0%
School and I was around and this was in
 
00:18:31.149 --> 00:18:31.159 align:start position:0%
I believe 2009 the chronology we needed
 
00:18:34.190 --> 00:18:34.200 align:start position:0%
to renovate Steven High School our only
 
00:18:37.110 --> 00:18:37.120 align:start position:0%
school public high school because uh we
 
00:18:39.190 --> 00:18:39.200 align:start position:0%
otherwise the high school would lose its
 
00:18:41.430 --> 00:18:41.440 align:start position:0%
accreditation it make it much harder for
 
00:18:43.830 --> 00:18:43.840 align:start position:0%
our students graduating from the high
 
00:18:46.390 --> 00:18:46.400 align:start position:0%
school there was a vote in March I
 
00:18:48.149 --> 00:18:48.159 align:start position:0%
believe March of
 
00:18:51.390 --> 00:18:51.400 align:start position:0%
2019 and it it won by I think one or two
 
00:18:54.350 --> 00:18:54.360 align:start position:0%
votes but the people opposed to the bond
 
00:18:56.669 --> 00:18:56.679 align:start position:0%
issue wanted a recount which is their
 
00:18:58.950 --> 00:18:58.960 align:start position:0%
right and they had a recount and then
 
00:19:03.310 --> 00:19:03.320 align:start position:0%
then the bond issue lost by one vote and
 
00:19:05.990 --> 00:19:06.000 align:start position:0%
it just shows the the principle of every
 
00:19:08.390 --> 00:19:08.400 align:start position:0%
vote counts including a bond
 
00:19:10.390 --> 00:19:10.400 align:start position:0%
issue uh
 
00:19:13.990 --> 00:19:14.000 align:start position:0%
then wait yeah okay let me the policy
 
00:19:16.909 --> 00:19:16.919 align:start position:0%
and basically to please our voters and
 
00:19:18.149 --> 00:19:18.159 align:start position:0%
try to get the
 
00:19:21.630 --> 00:19:21.640 align:start position:0%
support we went the school board working
 
00:19:22.950 --> 00:19:22.960 align:start position:0%
with the
 
00:19:26.029 --> 00:19:26.039 align:start position:0%
superintendant had to change some
 
00:19:28.909 --> 00:19:28.919 align:start position:0%
because uh some stuff to change in order
 
00:19:31.830 --> 00:19:31.840 align:start position:0%
uh the proposal in order to get it
 
00:19:35.390 --> 00:19:35.400 align:start position:0%
passed uh and especially to as at the
 
00:19:37.750 --> 00:19:37.760 align:start position:0%
same time our legislature I was a member
 
00:19:40.430 --> 00:19:40.440 align:start position:0%
of the house then uh along with then
 
00:19:42.750 --> 00:19:42.760 align:start position:0%
Governor Lynch and we were undergoing
 
00:19:45.590 --> 00:19:45.600 align:start position:0%
the Great Recession and as our duty as
 
00:19:47.270 --> 00:19:47.280 align:start position:0%
members of the House of Representative
 
00:19:49.190 --> 00:19:49.200 align:start position:0%
we have to have a balanced budget that's
 
00:19:50.789 --> 00:19:50.799 align:start position:0%
law basically it's actually under house
 
00:19:53.750 --> 00:19:53.760 align:start position:0%
rules but it has the force of law uh and
 
00:19:55.549 --> 00:19:55.559 align:start position:0%
nobody could come up with additional
 
00:19:57.830 --> 00:19:57.840 align:start position:0%
revenues and so it was cut across the
 
00:20:00.390 --> 00:20:00.400 align:start position:0%
board and as a result building Aid was
 
00:20:03.590 --> 00:20:03.600 align:start position:0%
cut out and our school district was
 
00:20:05.830 --> 00:20:05.840 align:start position:0%
ineligible to get any building Aid we
 
00:20:08.750 --> 00:20:08.760 align:start position:0%
had to proceed on a lower cost project
 
00:20:11.029 --> 00:20:11.039 align:start position:0%
we had to cut some things I believe it
 
00:20:14.029 --> 00:20:14.039 align:start position:0%
was in 2011 and we approved the project
 
00:20:15.830 --> 00:20:15.840 align:start position:0%
we still had hope to get some State
 
00:20:18.430 --> 00:20:18.440 align:start position:0%
Building Aid we did not the city of
 
00:20:21.110 --> 00:20:21.120 align:start position:0%
entire the city of Cl had to basically
 
00:20:23.590 --> 00:20:23.600 align:start position:0%
fund the entire renovation project on
 
00:20:26.230 --> 00:20:26.240 align:start position:0%
its own I don't have figures but it
 
00:20:28.710 --> 00:20:28.720 align:start position:0%
pushed our Pro and we the after two
 
00:20:31.549 --> 00:20:31.559 align:start position:0%
years the high school opened up in
 
00:20:34.110 --> 00:20:34.120 align:start position:0%
2013 I remember then Governor Hassen
 
00:20:36.789 --> 00:20:36.799 align:start position:0%
coming to sort of do a grand opening but
 
00:20:38.750 --> 00:20:38.760 align:start position:0%
she didn't bring any state aid
 
00:20:42.470 --> 00:20:42.480 align:start position:0%
unfortunately uh so result this pushed
 
00:20:45.029 --> 00:20:45.039 align:start position:0%
up our our property taxes and I remember
 
00:20:48.230 --> 00:20:48.240 align:start position:0%
in 2014 during the election voters were
 
00:20:50.390 --> 00:20:50.400 align:start position:0%
coming up to me and complaining why are
 
00:20:52.870 --> 00:20:52.880 align:start position:0%
our property tax rates the highest at
 
00:20:54.630 --> 00:20:54.640 align:start position:0%
the time in the state of New Hampshire
 
00:20:57.549 --> 00:20:57.559 align:start position:0%
and I said it's simply because of
 
00:20:59.470 --> 00:20:59.480 align:start position:0%
basically the bond issue a building Aid
 
00:21:01.510 --> 00:21:01.520 align:start position:0%
to renovate the high school and although
 
00:21:03.710 --> 00:21:03.720 align:start position:0%
today our propert property tax aren't
 
00:21:06.190 --> 00:21:06.200 align:start position:0%
quite as low I believe they would still
 
00:21:08.430 --> 00:21:08.440 align:start position:0%
be in the top 10 probably the vice chair
 
00:21:09.909 --> 00:21:09.919 align:start position:0%
could enlighten me there's probably
 
00:21:12.070 --> 00:21:12.080 align:start position:0%
other communities that have higher
 
00:21:14.390 --> 00:21:14.400 align:start position:0%
property tax rates and for Claremont
 
00:21:16.310 --> 00:21:16.320 align:start position:0%
because our property values are low
 
00:21:19.269 --> 00:21:19.279 align:start position:0%
that's a real problem so I would urge
 
00:21:22.350 --> 00:21:22.360 align:start position:0%
you to pass this bill it's not a perfect
 
00:21:24.149 --> 00:21:24.159 align:start position:0%
bill as the prime sponsor just alluded
 
00:21:26.110 --> 00:21:26.120 align:start position:0%
it's a compromise but if you could give
 
00:21:29.110 --> 00:21:29.120 align:start position:0%
us some some money that we could use
 
00:21:31.390 --> 00:21:31.400 align:start position:0%
to hopefully relieve property taxes for
 
00:21:33.669 --> 00:21:33.679 align:start position:0%
our taxpayers they would appreciate
 
00:21:36.269 --> 00:21:36.279 align:start position:0%
because I get this constantly from
 
00:21:37.870 --> 00:21:37.880 align:start position:0%
taxpayers and anybody else who
 
00:21:40.909 --> 00:21:40.919 align:start position:0%
represents Claremont and cyen gets the
 
00:21:45.350 --> 00:21:45.360 align:start position:0%
same uh Kickback uh feedback and it's
 
00:21:47.669 --> 00:21:47.679 align:start position:0%
been for you me I've been in my in my
 
00:21:49.990 --> 00:21:50.000 align:start position:0%
17th term and that's been one of the
 
00:21:52.950 --> 00:21:52.960 align:start position:0%
most top issues and top complaints the
 
00:21:55.830 --> 00:21:55.840 align:start position:0%
state needs to do more to fund education
 
00:21:58.630 --> 00:21:58.640 align:start position:0%
but also you know reduce property taxes
 
00:21:59.789 --> 00:21:59.799 align:start position:0%
I want to thank you very much for
 
00:22:01.310 --> 00:22:01.320 align:start position:0%
listening thank you very much are there
 
00:22:02.990 --> 00:22:03.000 align:start position:0%
any questions for representative cluder
 
00:22:05.750 --> 00:22:05.760 align:start position:0%
yes represent McGuire yes thank you Mr
 
00:22:06.990 --> 00:22:07.000 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
00:22:10.269 --> 00:22:10.279 align:start position:0%
question part of adequacy is conditioned
 
00:22:14.590 --> 00:22:14.600 align:start position:0%
on property tax value per student should
 
00:22:17.149 --> 00:22:17.159 align:start position:0%
should building Aid be the
 
00:22:21.750 --> 00:22:21.760 align:start position:0%
same uh I I'm not sure how to answer
 
00:22:23.870 --> 00:22:23.880 align:start position:0%
that question maybe but I'm not on an
 
00:22:25.390 --> 00:22:25.400 align:start position:0%
expert I'll admit I didn't bring any
 
00:22:28.909 --> 00:22:28.919 align:start position:0%
technical figures but you know and I
 
00:22:30.830 --> 00:22:30.840 align:start position:0%
come from Claremont we've been involved
 
00:22:32.870 --> 00:22:32.880 align:start position:0%
in in lawsuits over school fund I'll be
 
00:22:34.669 --> 00:22:34.679 align:start position:0%
right up front with you and it's still a
 
00:22:36.870 --> 00:22:36.880 align:start position:0%
problem and I know how it will be solved
 
00:22:39.310 --> 00:22:39.320 align:start position:0%
hopefully we as a legislature and a
 
00:22:41.909 --> 00:22:41.919 align:start position:0%
state can come together on this within
 
00:22:45.070 --> 00:22:45.080 align:start position:0%
the next couple years but and I'll admit
 
00:22:47.870 --> 00:22:47.880 align:start position:0%
I'm open to anything uh as far as
 
00:22:51.549 --> 00:22:51.559 align:start position:0%
funding uh but I want something done so
 
00:22:54.230 --> 00:22:54.240 align:start position:0%
that we can protect property poor
 
00:22:56.390 --> 00:22:56.400 align:start position:0%
communities like the ones I represent in
 
00:23:00.830 --> 00:23:00.840 align:start position:0%
Sullivan County uh from from having to
 
00:23:03.470 --> 00:23:03.480 align:start position:0%
pay such high property taxes to educate
 
00:23:06.590 --> 00:23:06.600 align:start position:0%
our kids so they can compete with people
 
00:23:08.950 --> 00:23:08.960 align:start position:0%
in other districts that are maybe have
 
00:23:10.830 --> 00:23:10.840 align:start position:0%
higher property weals for the jobs of
 
00:23:12.870 --> 00:23:12.880 align:start position:0%
the future it's it's we want to be sure
 
00:23:14.950 --> 00:23:14.960 align:start position:0%
they're well equipped to compete for
 
00:23:18.230 --> 00:23:18.240 align:start position:0%
these jobs and and uh have you know as I
 
00:23:21.310 --> 00:23:21.320 align:start position:0%
said be become good citizens and
 
00:23:23.149 --> 00:23:23.159 align:start position:0%
whatever you can do and I think this
 
00:23:26.029 --> 00:23:26.039 align:start position:0%
bill that I'm a co-sponsor is a small
 
00:23:28.190 --> 00:23:28.200 align:start position:0%
step forward I don't know I'm sorry if I
 
00:23:31.110 --> 00:23:31.120 align:start position:0%
is said but I think something needs to
 
00:23:32.470 --> 00:23:32.480 align:start position:0%
be done to help property poor
 
00:23:33.830 --> 00:23:33.840 align:start position:0%
communities representative Damon do you
 
00:23:34.870 --> 00:23:34.880 align:start position:0%
have hand
 
00:23:37.310 --> 00:23:37.320 align:start position:0%
up yes thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
00:23:39.710 --> 00:23:39.720 align:start position:0%
representative cluer as folks know we
 
00:23:41.510 --> 00:23:41.520 align:start position:0%
overlap in our
 
00:23:44.990 --> 00:23:45.000 align:start position:0%
representation I just wanted to
 
00:23:48.510 --> 00:23:48.520 align:start position:0%
um hear you perhaps emphasize the early
 
00:23:50.750 --> 00:23:50.760 align:start position:0%
statement you made that Claremont was in
 
00:23:52.590 --> 00:23:52.600 align:start position:0%
Jeopardy of losing the high school
 
00:23:54.470 --> 00:23:54.480 align:start position:0%
accreditation if the building project
 
00:23:57.549 --> 00:23:57.559 align:start position:0%
was not done which would really curtail
 
00:24:00.510 --> 00:24:00.520 align:start position:0%
student opportunity for higher education
 
00:24:01.950 --> 00:24:01.960 align:start position:0%
graduating from an unaccredited
 
00:24:04.789 --> 00:24:04.799 align:start position:0%
institution was that correct that yes I
 
00:24:07.430 --> 00:24:07.440 align:start position:0%
me time it's a problem I I'm by the way
 
00:24:09.549 --> 00:24:09.559 align:start position:0%
I'm a clont na a graduate of Stevens
 
00:24:11.669 --> 00:24:11.679 align:start position:0%
High School class of 75 by the way that
 
00:24:14.110 --> 00:24:14.120 align:start position:0%
was 50 years ago but re reaccreditation
 
00:24:17.230 --> 00:24:17.240 align:start position:0%
I learned way back as a student is very
 
00:24:19.190 --> 00:24:19.200 align:start position:0%
important if you want to go on to
 
00:24:24.190 --> 00:24:24.200 align:start position:0%
college and get uh as I said it helps uh
 
00:24:27.430 --> 00:24:27.440 align:start position:0%
graduates of that High School compete
 
00:24:29.950 --> 00:24:29.960 align:start position:0%
for for college spots compete in the job
 
00:24:32.750 --> 00:24:32.760 align:start position:0%
market so reaccreditation whether you
 
00:24:35.590 --> 00:24:35.600 align:start position:0%
like it or not is is very important so
 
00:24:37.590 --> 00:24:37.600 align:start position:0%
that's why our community felt they had
 
00:24:39.870 --> 00:24:39.880 align:start position:0%
to renovate the high school and as I
 
00:24:42.590 --> 00:24:42.600 align:start position:0%
said we we did one plan rejected by the
 
00:24:45.230 --> 00:24:45.240 align:start position:0%
voters very narrowly we came back with
 
00:24:47.549 --> 00:24:47.559 align:start position:0%
another plan that was approved by the
 
00:24:49.470 --> 00:24:49.480 align:start position:0%
voters but we still didn't get any state
 
00:24:52.230 --> 00:24:52.240 align:start position:0%
aid and our school board struggles and
 
00:24:54.029 --> 00:24:54.039 align:start position:0%
works hard and they're going to have to
 
00:24:55.510 --> 00:24:55.520 align:start position:0%
come in with a school budget that I
 
00:24:57.549 --> 00:24:57.559 align:start position:0%
think they managed to keep it very low
 
00:25:01.269 --> 00:25:01.279 align:start position:0%
this time preliminary reports so but it
 
00:25:03.190 --> 00:25:03.200 align:start position:0%
is not easy to be a member of a school
 
00:25:05.029 --> 00:25:05.039 align:start position:0%
board in clar mod is probably in a lot
 
00:25:06.590 --> 00:25:06.600 align:start position:0%
of other communities in Sullivan County
 
00:25:08.590 --> 00:25:08.600 align:start position:0%
I hope I answered your question includ
 
00:25:10.389 --> 00:25:10.399 align:start position:0%
here Senor as co-sponsor in this well I
 
00:25:12.430 --> 00:25:12.440 align:start position:0%
do have a question and I'd like to
 
00:25:15.430 --> 00:25:15.440 align:start position:0%
address uh lines 8 through 14 within the
 
00:25:17.630 --> 00:25:17.640 align:start position:0%
bill this is where we're paying back to
 
00:25:19.870 --> 00:25:19.880 align:start position:0%
communities which have already gone
 
00:25:24.070 --> 00:25:24.080 align:start position:0%
through the Hoops now my question is
 
00:25:27.470 --> 00:25:27.480 align:start position:0%
if these communities which built during
 
00:25:30.950 --> 00:25:30.960 align:start position:0%
the more atorium those 10
 
00:25:33.630 --> 00:25:33.640 align:start position:0%
years did not have an application
 
00:25:35.750 --> 00:25:35.760 align:start position:0%
submitted through the process and
 
00:25:38.830 --> 00:25:38.840 align:start position:0%
approve a process to doe to meet certain
 
00:25:42.149 --> 00:25:42.159 align:start position:0%
standards criteria that our Engineers
 
00:25:44.350 --> 00:25:44.360 align:start position:0%
require didn't go through the school
 
00:25:46.789 --> 00:25:46.799 align:start position:0%
building authority didn't go through the
 
00:25:49.269 --> 00:25:49.279 align:start position:0%
State Board of
 
00:25:52.269 --> 00:25:52.279 align:start position:0%
Education and now we're looking at
 
00:25:56.470 --> 00:25:56.480 align:start position:0%
taking monies which are needed for new
 
00:25:59.190 --> 00:25:59.200 align:start position:0%
construction and renovation
 
00:26:03.630 --> 00:26:03.640 align:start position:0%
to backfill what has done do you support
 
00:26:06.070 --> 00:26:06.080 align:start position:0%
this part of the bill versus the other
 
00:26:08.909 --> 00:26:08.919 align:start position:0%
part which would more or less help uh
 
00:26:10.830 --> 00:26:10.840 align:start position:0%
the communities which are on that list
 
00:26:10.840 --> 00:26:11.590 align:start position:0%
the communities which are on that list
of

00:26:11.590 --> 00:26:11.600 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:26:14.149 --> 00:26:14.159 align:start position:0%
17 well I I think this is as I
 
00:26:16.549 --> 00:26:16.559 align:start position:0%
understand at 18 it's it's only five $5
 
00:26:18.789 --> 00:26:18.799 align:start position:0%
million and it is a compromise we we
 
00:26:20.789 --> 00:26:20.799 align:start position:0%
we're not asking for the entire amount
 
00:26:23.269 --> 00:26:23.279 align:start position:0%
owed to us but we are asking for a
 
00:26:26.389 --> 00:26:26.399 align:start position:0%
compromise to help us you can are as I
 
00:26:29.630 --> 00:26:29.640 align:start position:0%
said I think I'm asking on behalf of
 
00:26:31.510 --> 00:26:31.520 align:start position:0%
this of of Claremont The Claremont
 
00:26:33.990 --> 00:26:34.000 align:start position:0%
School District for this as the prime
 
00:26:37.310 --> 00:26:37.320 align:start position:0%
sponsor said it's a compromise and and
 
00:26:40.870 --> 00:26:40.880 align:start position:0%
basically we need help in Claremont and
 
00:26:43.149 --> 00:26:43.159 align:start position:0%
I'm and and a lot of other property poor
 
00:26:46.230 --> 00:26:46.240 align:start position:0%
communities too so whatever you can do I
 
00:26:49.029 --> 00:26:49.039 align:start position:0%
understand people's concerns but I I
 
00:26:51.630 --> 00:26:51.640 align:start position:0%
really suggest that that this section at
 
00:26:54.029 --> 00:26:54.039 align:start position:0%
this point be left in there okay with
 
00:26:57.950 --> 00:26:57.960 align:start position:0%
all due respect uh to to you Mr chairman
 
00:27:01.310 --> 00:27:01.320 align:start position:0%
but I feel that it's only as I read the
 
00:27:04.230 --> 00:27:04.240 align:start position:0%
bill $5 million out of 60 million which
 
00:27:08.789 --> 00:27:08.799 align:start position:0%
is very very small and so the prime
 
00:27:10.750 --> 00:27:10.760 align:start position:0%
sponsor and I are asking that hopefully
 
00:27:12.630 --> 00:27:12.640 align:start position:0%
you look at this bill and you pass it I
 
00:27:14.190 --> 00:27:14.200 align:start position:0%
realize you may have to make some
 
00:27:16.070 --> 00:27:16.080 align:start position:0%
technical corrections but pass it with
 
00:27:18.310 --> 00:27:18.320 align:start position:0%
the principle of trying to help school
 
00:27:20.750 --> 00:27:20.760 align:start position:0%
districts in the past and in good faith
 
00:27:23.029 --> 00:27:23.039 align:start position:0%
you know put projects in and try to
 
00:27:24.710 --> 00:27:24.720 align:start position:0%
apply for stated and the window is
 
00:27:27.350 --> 00:27:27.360 align:start position:0%
slammed on them I mean maybe we had to
 
00:27:29.389 --> 00:27:29.399 align:start position:0%
do that because of the Great Recession
 
00:27:31.350 --> 00:27:31.360 align:start position:0%
we have to balance the budget and there
 
00:27:33.909 --> 00:27:33.919 align:start position:0%
were no alter Revenue Alternatives that
 
00:27:36.710 --> 00:27:36.720 align:start position:0%
were agreeable to everybody so I just
 
00:27:40.269 --> 00:27:40.279 align:start position:0%
ask this for the sake of justice for for
 
00:27:42.630 --> 00:27:42.640 align:start position:0%
my district and other districts who are
 
00:27:45.110 --> 00:27:45.120 align:start position:0%
struggling thank you are there further
 
00:27:48.470 --> 00:27:48.480 align:start position:0%
questions B and
 
00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:51.070 align:start position:0%
questions B and
Ames

00:27:51.070 --> 00:27:51.080 align:start position:0%
Ames
 
00:27:55.070 --> 00:27:55.080 align:start position:0%
question good morning good good morning
 
00:27:58.669 --> 00:27:58.679 align:start position:0%
um you've mentioned several times uh
 
00:28:00.990 --> 00:28:01.000 align:start position:0%
the truth that Claremont is a property
 
00:28:05.389 --> 00:28:05.399 align:start position:0%
poor community and um have uh said
 
00:28:08.710 --> 00:28:08.720 align:start position:0%
directly or indirectly that
 
00:28:11.870 --> 00:28:11.880 align:start position:0%
um we should try to help property poor
 
00:28:15.110 --> 00:28:15.120 align:start position:0%
communities as as I understand the uh
 
00:28:19.509 --> 00:28:19.519 align:start position:0%
Aid building aid program is not uh
 
00:28:23.909 --> 00:28:23.919 align:start position:0%
geared to steer money one way or another
 
00:28:27.509 --> 00:28:27.519 align:start position:0%
depending on property wealth and I'm my
 
00:28:30.710 --> 00:28:30.720 align:start position:0%
question to you is whether it
 
00:28:33.669 --> 00:28:33.679 align:start position:0%
should I think with all due respect I
 
00:28:35.669 --> 00:28:35.679 align:start position:0%
mean and I don't know whether it would I
 
00:28:37.269 --> 00:28:37.279 align:start position:0%
think we should consider it I mean
 
00:28:39.230 --> 00:28:39.240 align:start position:0%
either if we have to amend this bill or
 
00:28:41.070 --> 00:28:41.080 align:start position:0%
another bill which I'd be happy probably
 
00:28:43.430 --> 00:28:43.440 align:start position:0%
to at least sponsor I think as a matter
 
00:28:45.549 --> 00:28:45.559 align:start position:0%
of fairness we ought to do this because
 
00:28:47.830 --> 00:28:47.840 align:start position:0%
building Aid along with the rest of
 
00:28:50.470 --> 00:28:50.480 align:start position:0%
Education uh I I think it's we we we
 
00:28:52.149 --> 00:28:52.159 align:start position:0%
need to be fair and I don't want to
 
00:28:54.269 --> 00:28:54.279 align:start position:0%
discuss as a general rule but building
 
00:28:56.389 --> 00:28:56.399 align:start position:0%
Aid ought to be tied to a to a
 
00:28:58.110 --> 00:28:58.120 align:start position:0%
community's property wealth in my
 
00:29:00.789 --> 00:29:00.799 align:start position:0%
opinion off the top of my head further
 
00:29:02.870 --> 00:29:02.880 align:start position:0%
questions not seeing any thank you very
 
00:29:04.310 --> 00:29:04.320 align:start position:0%

00:29:39.590 --> 00:29:39.600 align:start position:0%
sincere thanks to representative Cahill
 
00:29:41.549 --> 00:29:41.559 align:start position:0%
for his commitment to this issue on
 
00:29:43.789 --> 00:29:43.799 align:start position:0%
behalf of the students parents and
 
00:29:46.430 --> 00:29:46.440 align:start position:0%
taxpayers of New Market and to people
 
00:29:49.350 --> 00:29:49.360 align:start position:0%
across the granite state I got involved
 
00:29:52.909 --> 00:29:52.919 align:start position:0%
locally on this issue about 14 years ago
 
00:29:54.950 --> 00:29:54.960 align:start position:0%
New Market was again grappling with how
 
00:29:57.590 --> 00:29:57.600 align:start position:0%
to manage our school facilities serious
 
00:30:00.350 --> 00:30:00.360 align:start position:0%
life and safety deficiencies I was a
 
00:30:02.870 --> 00:30:02.880 align:start position:0%
member of the PTA and I had two young
 
00:30:04.990 --> 00:30:05.000 align:start position:0%
boys and therefore had a serious stake
 
00:30:07.110 --> 00:30:07.120 align:start position:0%
in the future of our local
 
00:30:09.909 --> 00:30:09.919 align:start position:0%
schools we had two failed votes in New
 
00:30:11.990 --> 00:30:12.000 align:start position:0%
Market prior to the
 
00:30:14.070 --> 00:30:14.080 align:start position:0%
moratorium then during the following
 
00:30:16.389 --> 00:30:16.399 align:start position:0%
years even though there was a moratorium
 
00:30:18.269 --> 00:30:18.279 align:start position:0%
on school building Aid New Market didn't
 
00:30:19.950 --> 00:30:19.960 align:start position:0%
have the luxury to wait for the
 
00:30:23.190 --> 00:30:23.200 align:start position:0%
legislature to change its policy after
 
00:30:25.509 --> 00:30:25.519 align:start position:0%
years of struggling and no concrete
 
00:30:28.110 --> 00:30:28.120 align:start position:0%
sense of when the moratorium would end
 
00:30:30.630 --> 00:30:30.640 align:start position:0%
the community scaled back its push for a
 
00:30:33.149 --> 00:30:33.159 align:start position:0%
new school and decided to move forward
 
00:30:36.590 --> 00:30:36.600 align:start position:0%
on necessary Renovations of our school
 
00:30:36.600 --> 00:30:38.590 align:start position:0%
on necessary Renovations of our school
facilities

00:30:38.590 --> 00:30:38.600 align:start position:0%
facilities
 
00:30:40.509 --> 00:30:40.519 align:start position:0%
unfortunately though there may have been
 
00:30:43.110 --> 00:30:43.120 align:start position:0%
a moratorium on Aid that didn't make the
 
00:30:44.909 --> 00:30:44.919 align:start position:0%
need go
 
00:30:48.509 --> 00:30:48.519 align:start position:0%
away I was here in 2015 giving testimony
 
00:30:51.230 --> 00:30:51.240 align:start position:0%
on a similar Bill a bill that would
 
00:30:53.070 --> 00:30:53.080 align:start position:0%
allow school districts to apply for
 
00:30:54.870 --> 00:30:54.880 align:start position:0%
building aid for projects approved
 
00:30:57.629 --> 00:30:57.639 align:start position:0%
before the moratorium was lifted and
 
00:30:59.990 --> 00:31:00.000 align:start position:0%
here we are now I met with a new market
 
00:31:02.350 --> 00:31:02.360 align:start position:0%
superintendent just a week ago and we
 
00:31:04.430 --> 00:31:04.440 align:start position:0%
talked about the many budgetary issues
 
00:31:06.710 --> 00:31:06.720 align:start position:0%
facing the schools today including
 
00:31:09.110 --> 00:31:09.120 align:start position:0%
increased special education costs
 
00:31:12.269 --> 00:31:12.279 align:start position:0%
threats of unlimited efas and an overall
 
00:31:15.110 --> 00:31:15.120 align:start position:0%
lack of adequate funding but he then
 
00:31:17.629 --> 00:31:17.639 align:start position:0%
reminded me that in New Market they
 
00:31:19.870 --> 00:31:19.880 align:start position:0%
start the budget process two million $2
 
00:31:23.149 --> 00:31:23.159 align:start position:0%
million behind because of debt service
 
00:31:25.789 --> 00:31:25.799 align:start position:0%
and a lack of participation from the
 
00:31:27.950 --> 00:31:27.960 align:start position:0%
state New Market isn't the only
 
00:31:29.669 --> 00:31:29.679 align:start position:0%
community that needed to move forward on
 
00:31:32.149 --> 00:31:32.159 align:start position:0%
serious and Urgent facility needs even
 
00:31:34.549 --> 00:31:34.559 align:start position:0%
though there was a moratorium in place
 
00:31:37.870 --> 00:31:37.880 align:start position:0%
then and now we hoped and continue to
 
00:31:40.110 --> 00:31:40.120 align:start position:0%
hope that we can somehow provide some
 
00:31:41.950 --> 00:31:41.960 align:start position:0%
property tax relief to the communities
 
00:31:44.190 --> 00:31:44.200 align:start position:0%
like New Market even if it's just a
 
00:31:47.870 --> 00:31:47.880 align:start position:0%
little bit we sat here just last week
 
00:31:49.789 --> 00:31:49.799 align:start position:0%
discussing the financial implications of
 
00:31:49.799 --> 00:31:51.149 align:start position:0%
discussing the financial implications of
unrestricted

00:31:51.149 --> 00:31:51.159 align:start position:0%
unrestricted
 
00:31:53.669 --> 00:31:53.679 align:start position:0%
vouchers our priority should be funding
 
00:31:56.590 --> 00:31:56.600 align:start position:0%
our Public Schools including providing a
 
00:31:59.070 --> 00:31:59.080 align:start position:0%
safe and healthy learning environment
 
00:32:00.830 --> 00:32:00.840 align:start position:0%
and I urge my colleagues to consider
 
00:32:03.070 --> 00:32:03.080 align:start position:0%
this legislation and vote in favor of HB
 
00:32:05.669 --> 00:32:05.679 align:start position:0%
366 thank you thank you very much are
 
00:32:07.430 --> 00:32:07.440 align:start position:0%
there questions from the
 
00:32:11.830 --> 00:32:11.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:15.549 --> 00:32:15.559 align:start position:0%
much just represent papovich thank you
 
00:32:17.310 --> 00:32:17.320 align:start position:0%
Mr chair thank you representative for
 
00:32:19.509 --> 00:32:19.519 align:start position:0%
taking the question I will be very very
 
00:32:22.590 --> 00:32:22.600 align:start position:0%
brief could you you know you said that
 
00:32:25.149 --> 00:32:25.159 align:start position:0%
you ended up having to build a smaller
 
00:32:27.350 --> 00:32:27.360 align:start position:0%
facility when no building Aid was
 
00:32:27.360 --> 00:32:28.350 align:start position:0%
facility when no building Aid was
available

00:32:28.350 --> 00:32:28.360 align:start position:0%
available
 
00:32:30.350 --> 00:32:30.360 align:start position:0%
does the current facility meet the needs
 
00:32:33.070 --> 00:32:33.080 align:start position:0%
of the new market
 
00:32:36.669 --> 00:32:36.679 align:start position:0%
schools um I would argue that it does
 
00:32:41.990 --> 00:32:42.000 align:start position:0%
meet the needs um and and so yeah I
 
00:32:43.710 --> 00:32:43.720 align:start position:0%
think that we went back to the drawing
 
00:32:47.070 --> 00:32:47.080 align:start position:0%
board and
 
00:32:51.029 --> 00:32:51.039 align:start position:0%
um and built a facility uh or renovated
 
00:32:54.149 --> 00:32:54.159 align:start position:0%
the facilities um we renovated both the
 
00:32:55.629 --> 00:32:55.639 align:start position:0%
high school and the ele the Junior
 
00:32:57.070 --> 00:32:57.080 align:start position:0%
Senior High School and the elementary
 
00:32:58.430 --> 00:32:58.440 align:start position:0%
school in the process
 
00:33:01.509 --> 00:33:01.519 align:start position:0%
great thank you further questions not

00:33:29.350 --> 00:33:29.360 align:start position:0%
of Milford um so so I want to speak you
 
00:33:33.590 --> 00:33:33.600 align:start position:0%
uh in favor of uh the bill before you um
 
00:33:34.950 --> 00:33:34.960 align:start position:0%
and I'm just going to tell you in full
 
00:33:38.110 --> 00:33:38.120 align:start position:0%
disclosure that uh Hamstead is uh number
 
00:33:41.629 --> 00:33:41.639 align:start position:0%
sixth on the ranked list of schools uh
 
00:33:44.029 --> 00:33:44.039 align:start position:0%
to receive uh funding so they're clearly
 
00:33:46.430 --> 00:33:46.440 align:start position:0%
is a benefit and a financial interest to
 
00:33:49.269 --> 00:33:49.279 align:start position:0%
my school district to be here today uh
 
00:33:51.830 --> 00:33:51.840 align:start position:0%
but so I wanted to just walk you through
 
00:33:53.430 --> 00:33:53.440 align:start position:0%
very quickly some of the issues that
 
00:33:55.430 --> 00:33:55.440 align:start position:0%
we're dealing with in Hamstead that I
 
00:33:57.830 --> 00:33:57.840 align:start position:0%
know other schools are dealing with as
 
00:34:00.350 --> 00:34:00.360 align:start position:0%
well so specifically we're looking to do
 
00:34:03.350 --> 00:34:03.360 align:start position:0%
um an addition to our elementary school
 
00:34:06.070 --> 00:34:06.080 align:start position:0%
and there's a couple of issues um that
 
00:34:08.629 --> 00:34:08.639 align:start position:0%
are Urgent um and we need to solve those
 
00:34:12.270 --> 00:34:12.280 align:start position:0%
problems today uh and one is uh
 
00:34:14.069 --> 00:34:14.079 align:start position:0%
overcrowding uh so I know there are
 
00:34:16.389 --> 00:34:16.399 align:start position:0%
other school uh school districts and
 
00:34:17.589 --> 00:34:17.599 align:start position:0%
other towns that they're seeing
 
00:34:19.470 --> 00:34:19.480 align:start position:0%
declining enrollments that is not the
 
00:34:22.149 --> 00:34:22.159 align:start position:0%
case in Hamstead uh in Hamstead we see a
 
00:34:26.190 --> 00:34:26.200 align:start position:0%
trend we see uh older uh couples uh who
 
00:34:28.190 --> 00:34:28.200 align:start position:0%
are uh trying to capitalize on high
 
00:34:30.629 --> 00:34:30.639 align:start position:0%
property values they're they're moving
 
00:34:32.190 --> 00:34:32.200 align:start position:0%
and we have young families who are
 
00:34:34.389 --> 00:34:34.399 align:start position:0%
moving into Hamstead and so we will see
 
00:34:36.149 --> 00:34:36.159 align:start position:0%
over the next 10 years a pretty
 
00:34:38.510 --> 00:34:38.520 align:start position:0%
significant uh increase in our student
 
00:34:40.349 --> 00:34:40.359 align:start position:0%
enrollment and we don't know where we're
 
00:34:42.990 --> 00:34:43.000 align:start position:0%
going to put them uh we have teachers
 
00:34:45.990 --> 00:34:46.000 align:start position:0%
that are on carts we have uh teachers
 
00:34:48.629 --> 00:34:48.639 align:start position:0%
that teach in undersized classrooms it's
 
00:34:51.470 --> 00:34:51.480 align:start position:0%
a real problem and the second issue is
 
00:34:53.310 --> 00:34:53.320 align:start position:0%
uh we have some safety concerns at the
 
00:34:55.470 --> 00:34:55.480 align:start position:0%
building and I'm not going to go into
 
00:34:57.910 --> 00:34:57.920 align:start position:0%
those specifically here uh but just say
 
00:34:59.910 --> 00:34:59.920 align:start position:0%
you know we've appreciated uh being the
 
00:35:03.030 --> 00:35:03.040 align:start position:0%
recipient of uh the safe grants uh the
 
00:35:06.069 --> 00:35:06.079 align:start position:0%
last round round three uh the school
 
00:35:06.079 --> 00:35:06.990 align:start position:0%
last round round three uh the school
received

00:35:06.990 --> 00:35:07.000 align:start position:0%
received
 
00:35:09.310 --> 00:35:09.320 align:start position:0%
$100,000 uh and that money is greatly
 
00:35:12.550 --> 00:35:12.560 align:start position:0%
appreciated uh but to solve major
 
00:35:16.230 --> 00:35:16.240 align:start position:0%
structural building issues $100,000 is
 
00:35:19.270 --> 00:35:19.280 align:start position:0%
not sufficient uh we need an addition uh
 
00:35:20.630 --> 00:35:20.640 align:start position:0%
that will help us to address some of
 
00:35:21.829 --> 00:35:21.839 align:start position:0%
those safety
 
00:35:23.870 --> 00:35:23.880 align:start position:0%
concerns and the last issue and the one
 
00:35:26.270 --> 00:35:26.280 align:start position:0%
I'd really like to focus on is special
 
00:35:28.950 --> 00:35:28.960 align:start position:0%
education and uh so our special
 
00:35:31.510 --> 00:35:31.520 align:start position:0%
education program uh the building was
 
00:35:33.670 --> 00:35:33.680 align:start position:0%
not built when special education came
 
00:35:36.190 --> 00:35:36.200 align:start position:0%
into existence and therefore the model
 
00:35:38.870 --> 00:35:38.880 align:start position:0%
that we have has students being educated
 
00:35:43.109 --> 00:35:43.119 align:start position:0%
in very small cramped overcrowded spaces
 
00:35:45.950 --> 00:35:45.960 align:start position:0%
uh some that were previously closets uh
 
00:35:45.960 --> 00:35:47.190 align:start position:0%
uh some that were previously closets uh
windowless

00:35:47.190 --> 00:35:47.200 align:start position:0%
windowless
 
00:35:49.309 --> 00:35:49.319 align:start position:0%
spaces and what I'd like to do rather
 
00:35:50.710 --> 00:35:50.720 align:start position:0%
than just focusing on Hamstead is I'd
 
00:35:52.710 --> 00:35:52.720 align:start position:0%
like to make that connection with uh
 
00:35:54.950 --> 00:35:54.960 align:start position:0%
special education Aid and and I know
 
00:35:58.390 --> 00:35:58.400 align:start position:0%
that's a Hot Topic but if you I'm sure
 
00:36:00.309 --> 00:36:00.319 align:start position:0%
you uh you know you've looked into this
 
00:36:02.550 --> 00:36:02.560 align:start position:0%
and you realized that the majority of
 
00:36:05.150 --> 00:36:05.160 align:start position:0%
your special education Aid goes to out
 
00:36:08.030 --> 00:36:08.040 align:start position:0%
of District placements that's tuition
 
00:36:10.550 --> 00:36:10.560 align:start position:0%
and that's also Transportation as well
 
00:36:12.109 --> 00:36:12.119 align:start position:0%
and I can tell you that part of the
 
00:36:13.950 --> 00:36:13.960 align:start position:0%
solution to the special education
 
00:36:16.870 --> 00:36:16.880 align:start position:0%
funding issue is building Aid and
 
00:36:20.230 --> 00:36:20.240 align:start position:0%
Hamstead is a great example in order for
 
00:36:23.750 --> 00:36:23.760 align:start position:0%
us to um if we had more space we would
 
00:36:26.910 --> 00:36:26.920 align:start position:0%
be able to expand our in District
 
00:36:26.920 --> 00:36:28.309 align:start position:0%
be able to expand our in District
programming

00:36:28.309 --> 00:36:28.319 align:start position:0%
programming
 
00:36:30.670 --> 00:36:30.680 align:start position:0%
right now we have an issue where we do
 
00:36:33.710 --> 00:36:33.720 align:start position:0%
not have the space to provide some uh
 
00:36:35.630 --> 00:36:35.640 align:start position:0%
programs that would educate children
 
00:36:38.710 --> 00:36:38.720 align:start position:0%
with disabilities in our own school and
 
00:36:40.829 --> 00:36:40.839 align:start position:0%
I'll even use the transportation example
 
00:36:43.190 --> 00:36:43.200 align:start position:0%
I have students whose Transportation
 
00:36:46.109 --> 00:36:46.119 align:start position:0%
Bill alone is
 
00:36:48.790 --> 00:36:48.800 align:start position:0%
$50,000 a year just to transport
 
00:36:50.710 --> 00:36:50.720 align:start position:0%
students to a special education
 
00:36:53.390 --> 00:36:53.400 align:start position:0%
placement we can educate those children
 
00:36:55.910 --> 00:36:55.920 align:start position:0%
in our own District if we have the space
 
00:36:58.430 --> 00:36:58.440 align:start position:0%
the ability to expand it is a major
 
00:37:01.069 --> 00:37:01.079 align:start position:0%
limitation of schools and one that needs
 
00:37:04.109 --> 00:37:04.119 align:start position:0%
to be considered and if we look beyond
 
00:37:06.829 --> 00:37:06.839 align:start position:0%
the money we really need to look at that
 
00:37:09.270 --> 00:37:09.280 align:start position:0%
imperative if you are a family and
 
00:37:11.430 --> 00:37:11.440 align:start position:0%
you've moved to Hamstead to benefit from
 
00:37:13.870 --> 00:37:13.880 align:start position:0%
the Hamstead schools and your child has
 
00:37:13.880 --> 00:37:14.630 align:start position:0%
the Hamstead schools and your child has
a

00:37:14.630 --> 00:37:14.640 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:37:17.790 --> 00:37:17.800 align:start position:0%
disability that your child deserves the
 
00:37:19.790 --> 00:37:19.800 align:start position:0%
opportunity to be educated in the
 
00:37:22.349 --> 00:37:22.359 align:start position:0%
community they live in to be educated
 
00:37:23.790 --> 00:37:23.800 align:start position:0%
with their neighbors and the other
 
00:37:27.349 --> 00:37:27.359 align:start position:0%
children and not bust an hour away uh to
 
00:37:29.470 --> 00:37:29.480 align:start position:0%
an an a of District placement simply
 
00:37:32.510 --> 00:37:32.520 align:start position:0%
because we don't have the space there
 
00:37:34.230 --> 00:37:34.240 align:start position:0%
will always be children with severe
 
00:37:35.990 --> 00:37:36.000 align:start position:0%
disabilities that our school will not be
 
00:37:38.510 --> 00:37:38.520 align:start position:0%
able to serve but that's not the case
 
00:37:41.710 --> 00:37:41.720 align:start position:0%
with all children building Aid is an
 
00:37:44.390 --> 00:37:44.400 align:start position:0%
investment in the future it's an
 
00:37:45.430 --> 00:37:45.440 align:start position:0%
investment for children with
 
00:37:47.710 --> 00:37:47.720 align:start position:0%
disabilities and it helps to solve some
 
00:37:49.230 --> 00:37:49.240 align:start position:0%
of the funding issues that I know that
 
00:37:51.470 --> 00:37:51.480 align:start position:0%
you'll be discussing when it comes to
 
00:37:54.150 --> 00:37:54.160 align:start position:0%
special education Aid thank you for your
 
00:37:55.990 --> 00:37:56.000 align:start position:0%
consideration are there any questions of
 
00:37:58.309 --> 00:37:58.319 align:start position:0%
the superintendent yes thank you Mr
 
00:38:00.270 --> 00:38:00.280 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you superintendent for
 
00:38:02.470 --> 00:38:02.480 align:start position:0%
testifying I want to be very brief again
 
00:38:06.270 --> 00:38:06.280 align:start position:0%
it's a long day you said $50,000 for
 
00:38:08.390 --> 00:38:08.400 align:start position:0%
transportation I it's the first time I
 
00:38:10.390 --> 00:38:10.400 align:start position:0%
heard the number of that magnitude can
 
00:38:12.109 --> 00:38:12.119 align:start position:0%
you very briefly give me an
 
00:38:14.390 --> 00:38:14.400 align:start position:0%
understanding of why God's name does it
 
00:38:16.309 --> 00:38:16.319 align:start position:0%
cost so much in that particular case I
 
00:38:19.030 --> 00:38:19.040 align:start position:0%
know special ed is unique but I just
 
00:38:20.950 --> 00:38:20.960 align:start position:0%
would appreciate a bit of background so
 
00:38:23.470 --> 00:38:23.480 align:start position:0%
absolutely so first is um supply and
 
00:38:26.430 --> 00:38:26.440 align:start position:0%
demand there is a limited number of uh
 
00:38:28.910 --> 00:38:28.920 align:start position:0%
Transportation Prov providers uh
 
00:38:30.510 --> 00:38:30.520 align:start position:0%
particularly those are going to work um
 
00:38:33.390 --> 00:38:33.400 align:start position:0%
with students um in uh special education
 
00:38:36.670 --> 00:38:36.680 align:start position:0%
with disabilities uh we are permitted to
 
00:38:39.790 --> 00:38:39.800 align:start position:0%
uh transport a uh student up to 1 hour
 
00:38:43.030 --> 00:38:43.040 align:start position:0%
away from their uh their residence a 1H
 
00:38:46.190 --> 00:38:46.200 align:start position:0%
hour uh in we have children with pretty
 
00:38:48.109 --> 00:38:48.119 align:start position:0%
uh specific disabilities that require
 
00:38:49.990 --> 00:38:50.000 align:start position:0%
certain schools and even those schools
 
00:38:53.670 --> 00:38:53.680 align:start position:0%
are fairly Limited in number so that is
 
00:38:55.589 --> 00:38:55.599 align:start position:0%
uh student that could travel up to an
 
00:38:58.470 --> 00:38:58.480 align:start position:0%
hour away from uh their home home uh
 
00:39:00.950 --> 00:39:00.960 align:start position:0%
both ways uh they require some type of
 
00:39:03.030 --> 00:39:03.040 align:start position:0%
specialized Transportation uh because
 
00:39:05.190 --> 00:39:05.200 align:start position:0%
they may have a physical disability uh
 
00:39:07.790 --> 00:39:07.800 align:start position:0%
they may require a bus monitor because
 
00:39:10.230 --> 00:39:10.240 align:start position:0%
uh they have an emotional disability or
 
00:39:13.230 --> 00:39:13.240 align:start position:0%
even an LNA because of a medical need uh
 
00:39:15.910 --> 00:39:15.920 align:start position:0%
the costs are are pretty significant and
 
00:39:18.190 --> 00:39:18.200 align:start position:0%
again it's also another issue where uh
 
00:39:19.950 --> 00:39:19.960 align:start position:0%
special education Transportation it's
 
00:39:22.670 --> 00:39:22.680 align:start position:0%
not only the cost it's the availability
 
00:39:25.430 --> 00:39:25.440 align:start position:0%
uh there's not enough out there to um to
 
00:39:28.430 --> 00:39:28.440 align:start position:0%
meet uh the actual demand thank you
 
00:39:32.069 --> 00:39:32.079 align:start position:0%
represent fellows yes thank you um do
 
00:39:34.390 --> 00:39:34.400 align:start position:0%
you already have the plan for what you
 
00:39:36.710 --> 00:39:36.720 align:start position:0%
want to do for the renovation and if you
 
00:39:40.270 --> 00:39:40.280 align:start position:0%
do I'm wondering if building um
 
00:39:42.950 --> 00:39:42.960 align:start position:0%
including space that's good for the
 
00:39:44.950 --> 00:39:44.960 align:start position:0%
special ed special
 
00:39:47.190 --> 00:39:47.200 align:start position:0%
population could help other school
 
00:39:49.630 --> 00:39:49.640 align:start position:0%
districts nearby also because could they
 
00:39:52.150 --> 00:39:52.160 align:start position:0%
to would you did are you planning to be
 
00:39:55.990 --> 00:39:56.000 align:start position:0%
able to accommodate some out of District
 
00:40:00.069 --> 00:40:00.079 align:start position:0%
students y so uh our plan right now uh
 
00:40:02.990 --> 00:40:03.000 align:start position:0%
is um on file uh with the Department of
 
00:40:05.510 --> 00:40:05.520 align:start position:0%
Education uh and includes uh class
 
00:40:07.430 --> 00:40:07.440 align:start position:0%
classroom expansion a new main office
 
00:40:10.589 --> 00:40:10.599 align:start position:0%
new nurse Suite uh in a library as well
 
00:40:13.829 --> 00:40:13.839 align:start position:0%
what that does is it uh frees up uh
 
00:40:16.990 --> 00:40:17.000 align:start position:0%
space for the um for expansion of uh
 
00:40:18.349 --> 00:40:18.359 align:start position:0%
special education just a real quick
 
00:40:20.910 --> 00:40:20.920 align:start position:0%
example our nurse's office for example
 
00:40:23.390 --> 00:40:23.400 align:start position:0%
uh the existing nurses office isn't
 
00:40:26.030 --> 00:40:26.040 align:start position:0%
adequate uh for the nurses needs uh but
 
00:40:27.670 --> 00:40:27.680 align:start position:0%
it would be a space that would include a
 
00:40:30.030 --> 00:40:30.040 align:start position:0%
bathroom having a a space with a
 
00:40:31.710 --> 00:40:31.720 align:start position:0%
bathroom could really help with a
 
00:40:33.190 --> 00:40:33.200 align:start position:0%
student with an intellectual disability
 
00:40:35.950 --> 00:40:35.960 align:start position:0%
or another type of disability uh as far
 
00:40:39.510 --> 00:40:39.520 align:start position:0%
as you know right now um I guess it's if
 
00:40:41.430 --> 00:40:41.440 align:start position:0%
you build it they will come uh we need
 
00:40:44.390 --> 00:40:44.400 align:start position:0%
to first uh be able to see the needs
 
00:40:46.190 --> 00:40:46.200 align:start position:0%
that we have seem to increase every
 
00:40:48.430 --> 00:40:48.440 align:start position:0%
single year so it can be difficult to
 
00:40:50.550 --> 00:40:50.560 align:start position:0%
forecast in the future uh not just
 
00:40:52.430 --> 00:40:52.440 align:start position:0%
meeting our own needs but those of other
 
00:40:54.109 --> 00:40:54.119 align:start position:0%
schools I think ideally it would be
 
00:40:55.950 --> 00:40:55.960 align:start position:0%
great we already work pretty uh
 
00:40:57.270 --> 00:40:57.280 align:start position:0%
cooperatively with other school district
 
00:40:59.829 --> 00:40:59.839 align:start position:0%
districts to help meet needs and uh if
 
00:41:02.710 --> 00:41:02.720 align:start position:0%
the space were to allow it
 
00:41:05.910 --> 00:41:05.920 align:start position:0%
absolutely thank you very much not see
 
00:41:08.270 --> 00:41:08.280 align:start position:0%
any other people wanting to speak or ask
 
00:41:10.390 --> 00:41:10.400 align:start position:0%
a question thank you very much thank you
 
00:41:18.829 --> 00:41:18.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:21.550 --> 00:41:21.560 align:start position:0%
Trumble uh as advice for the committee
 
00:41:23.990 --> 00:41:24.000 align:start position:0%
members we have one last person has pink
 
00:41:26.069 --> 00:41:26.079 align:start position:0%
card in it is the Department of
 
00:41:30.109 --> 00:41:30.119 align:start position:0%
Education and and Tim Carney is here uh
 
00:41:32.109 --> 00:41:32.119 align:start position:0%
if in case there are some questions
 
00:41:34.470 --> 00:41:34.480 align:start position:0%
thank you good morning Mr chairman good
 
00:41:35.829 --> 00:41:35.839 align:start position:0%
morning committee members my name is
 
00:41:38.150 --> 00:41:38.160 align:start position:0%
David Trumble I'm from the town of where
 
00:41:40.589 --> 00:41:40.599 align:start position:0%
uh in where we had a middle school that
 
00:41:42.390 --> 00:41:42.400 align:start position:0%
was in violation of the school state
 
00:41:45.230 --> 00:41:45.240 align:start position:0%
building codes we failed State money
 
00:41:47.950 --> 00:41:47.960 align:start position:0%
allowed us this is 15ish years ago to
 
00:41:50.150 --> 00:41:50.160 align:start position:0%
rebuild our Middle School a new building
 
00:41:53.190 --> 00:41:53.200 align:start position:0%
at that one with three votes if the
 
00:41:55.430 --> 00:41:55.440 align:start position:0%
state money had not been there it would
 
00:41:57.510 --> 00:41:57.520 align:start position:0%
not have passed so your money when you
 
00:41:59.349 --> 00:41:59.359 align:start position:0%
spend a dollar on State Building Aid
 
00:42:01.069 --> 00:42:01.079 align:start position:0%
you're leveraging two or three dollars
 
00:42:03.190 --> 00:42:03.200 align:start position:0%
coming from the local communities I had
 
00:42:04.950 --> 00:42:04.960 align:start position:0%
a few points to add to the discussion
 
00:42:07.390 --> 00:42:07.400 align:start position:0%
first this I think the state has a duty
 
00:42:09.589 --> 00:42:09.599 align:start position:0%
to assist in the funding for building
 
00:42:12.630 --> 00:42:12.640 align:start position:0%
local schools for over 100 years we've
 
00:42:14.750 --> 00:42:14.760 align:start position:0%
had the standard School Statute in place
 
00:42:16.710 --> 00:42:16.720 align:start position:0%
it's RSA
 
00:42:19.549 --> 00:42:19.559 align:start position:0%
18924 where the state mandates suitable
 
00:42:22.589 --> 00:42:22.599 align:start position:0%
and sanitary Public Schools everywhere
 
00:42:24.230 --> 00:42:24.240 align:start position:0%
so it's this is not like fire
 
00:42:26.069 --> 00:42:26.079 align:start position:0%
departments where there is no mandate
 
00:42:29.230 --> 00:42:29.240 align:start position:0%
that there be uh fire departments you
 
00:42:31.750 --> 00:42:31.760 align:start position:0%
mandate that there be suitable schools
 
00:42:33.670 --> 00:42:33.680 align:start position:0%
in every town I think when you mandate
 
00:42:35.549 --> 00:42:35.559 align:start position:0%
something then there comes an obligation
 
00:42:37.829 --> 00:42:37.839 align:start position:0%
to help fund it the second is that the
 
00:42:40.549 --> 00:42:40.559 align:start position:0%
10year moratorium has put us at a spot
 
00:42:42.510 --> 00:42:42.520 align:start position:0%
where we can no longer provide an
 
00:42:44.470 --> 00:42:44.480 align:start position:0%
adequate learning environment the New
 
00:42:45.790 --> 00:42:45.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire school funding fairness
 
00:42:48.230 --> 00:42:48.240 align:start position:0%
project did a report on the State
 
00:42:49.710 --> 00:42:49.720 align:start position:0%
Building aiding condition of New
 
00:42:52.670 --> 00:42:52.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire public schools in July of 2023
 
00:42:54.430 --> 00:42:54.440 align:start position:0%
it's the most recent report that I can
 
00:42:58.270 --> 00:42:58.280 align:start position:0%
find anywhere here's what they found 20%
 
00:43:00.109 --> 00:43:00.119 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire school students are in
 
00:43:02.270 --> 00:43:02.280 align:start position:0%
buildings that have not been updated for
 
00:43:05.829 --> 00:43:05.839 align:start position:0%
35 years as bestos and Lead are found in
 
00:43:08.829 --> 00:43:08.839 align:start position:0%
24% of New Hampshire's public schools
 
00:43:11.069 --> 00:43:11.079 align:start position:0%
and the largest group of students 30% in
 
00:43:12.630 --> 00:43:12.640 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire go to buildings where
 
00:43:14.510 --> 00:43:14.520 align:start position:0%
their most recent construction or
 
00:43:16.870 --> 00:43:16.880 align:start position:0%
renovation was in the 1990s that's 30
 
00:43:19.430 --> 00:43:19.440 align:start position:0%
years ago so what does that mean for
 
00:43:21.990 --> 00:43:22.000 align:start position:0%
schools how old is too old for a schools
 
00:43:23.870 --> 00:43:23.880 align:start position:0%
um I did a little looking around the
 
00:43:26.150 --> 00:43:26.160 align:start position:0%
internet to find that out because it was
 
00:43:28.030 --> 00:43:28.040 align:start position:0%
not clear to me and the national Center
 
00:43:29.910 --> 00:43:29.920 align:start position:0%
for Education statistics wrote a brief
 
00:43:31.829 --> 00:43:31.839 align:start position:0%
on how old are America's schools and I
 
00:43:34.750 --> 00:43:34.760 align:start position:0%
said when a school is 20 to 30 years old
 
00:43:36.710 --> 00:43:36.720 align:start position:0%
frequent replacement of equipment is
 
00:43:38.910 --> 00:43:38.920 align:start position:0%
needed between 30 and 40 years the
 
00:43:40.390 --> 00:43:40.400 align:start position:0%
original equipment should have been
 
00:43:43.270 --> 00:43:43.280 align:start position:0%
replaced roofs and electrical after 40 a
 
00:43:44.710 --> 00:43:44.720 align:start position:0%
school building begins rapid
 
00:43:46.589 --> 00:43:46.599 align:start position:0%
deterioration and at 60 years most
 
00:43:48.549 --> 00:43:48.559 align:start position:0%
schools are abandoned so what that means
 
00:43:50.750 --> 00:43:50.760 align:start position:0%
is you got 20% of your schools that are
 
00:43:52.790 --> 00:43:52.800 align:start position:0%
in the state of somewhere between rapid
 
00:43:55.309 --> 00:43:55.319 align:start position:0%
deterioration and abandonment another
 
00:43:58.670 --> 00:43:58.680 align:start position:0%
30% by the end of this decade will enter
 
00:44:00.829 --> 00:44:00.839 align:start position:0%
will enter that phase as well that's
 
00:44:03.910 --> 00:44:03.920 align:start position:0%
half of the schools if we ex do not
 
00:44:06.270 --> 00:44:06.280 align:start position:0%
adequately fund this project now you're
 
00:44:07.950 --> 00:44:07.960 align:start position:0%
going to end up in a state of crisis in
 
00:44:09.790 --> 00:44:09.800 align:start position:0%
your schools the last thing I wanted to
 
00:44:12.069 --> 00:44:12.079 align:start position:0%
add is well does school buildings is it
 
00:44:13.630 --> 00:44:13.640 align:start position:0%
just a matter of comfort or does it
 
00:44:15.790 --> 00:44:15.800 align:start position:0%
actually help with school attainment
 
00:44:17.230 --> 00:44:17.240 align:start position:0%
there's been some studies on this
 
00:44:18.589 --> 00:44:18.599 align:start position:0%
there's not a lot of them but I found
 
00:44:20.349 --> 00:44:20.359 align:start position:0%
one from a professor from Virginia
 
00:44:23.670 --> 00:44:23.680 align:start position:0%
polych Institute Glenn Earthman and he
 
00:44:25.069 --> 00:44:25.079 align:start position:0%
looked at studies from around the
 
00:44:27.230 --> 00:44:27.240 align:start position:0%
country he cited several studies and
 
00:44:28.430 --> 00:44:28.440 align:start position:0%
said that the condition of school
 
00:44:30.470 --> 00:44:30.480 align:start position:0%
buildings has a sizable and measurable
 
00:44:32.950 --> 00:44:32.960 align:start position:0%
influence on the achievement of students
 
00:44:34.910 --> 00:44:34.920 align:start position:0%
the average difference between students
 
00:44:37.430 --> 00:44:37.440 align:start position:0%
in old or substandard buildings and
 
00:44:39.270 --> 00:44:39.280 align:start position:0%
those students in modern or above
 
00:44:42.109 --> 00:44:42.119 align:start position:0%
standard buildings is 5 to 17 percentile
 
00:44:45.030 --> 00:44:45.040 align:start position:0%
points and an urban areas it's 14 to 17
 
00:44:46.750 --> 00:44:46.760 align:start position:0%
so what's a percentile point it's not a
 
00:44:48.630 --> 00:44:48.640 align:start position:0%
percentage it's a percentile so if
 
00:44:50.270 --> 00:44:50.280 align:start position:0%
people come in and say why is my school
 
00:44:52.790 --> 00:44:52.800 align:start position:0%
only performing at the 50th percentile
 
00:44:55.069 --> 00:44:55.079 align:start position:0%
if they had a decent building they would
 
00:44:57.349 --> 00:44:57.359 align:start position:0%
go up 14 percentile points point they
 
00:45:00.109 --> 00:45:00.119 align:start position:0%
would be in the 60th percentile so in
 
00:45:02.630 --> 00:45:02.640 align:start position:0%
other words basic things like having a
 
00:45:05.030 --> 00:45:05.040 align:start position:0%
decent building which has obviously room
 
00:45:06.589 --> 00:45:06.599 align:start position:0%
for special ed students so they're not
 
00:45:09.470 --> 00:45:09.480 align:start position:0%
in closets but temperature control
 
00:45:11.829 --> 00:45:11.839 align:start position:0%
ventilation natural lighting all these
 
00:45:14.589 --> 00:45:14.599 align:start position:0%
things provides better performance you
 
00:45:17.390 --> 00:45:17.400 align:start position:0%
can get over 10 percentile points by
 
00:45:19.630 --> 00:45:19.640 align:start position:0%
taking schools from substandard to
 
00:45:21.470 --> 00:45:21.480 align:start position:0%
standard so it just seems like since we
 
00:45:23.230 --> 00:45:23.240 align:start position:0%
mandate that schools do this the state
 
00:45:25.670 --> 00:45:25.680 align:start position:0%
has an obligation and that that I urge
 
00:45:27.150 --> 00:45:27.160 align:start position:0%
you to look at that report from the New
 
00:45:28.309 --> 00:45:28.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire school funding fairness
 
00:45:29.990 --> 00:45:30.000 align:start position:0%
project thank you thank you very much
 
00:45:31.910 --> 00:45:31.920 align:start position:0%
are there any questions representative
 
00:45:34.109 --> 00:45:34.119 align:start position:0%
papovich thank you Mr chair and thank
 
00:45:35.990 --> 00:45:36.000 align:start position:0%
you for taking the question you are
 
00:45:38.030 --> 00:45:38.040 align:start position:0%
citing a scientific study do you know
 
00:45:40.349 --> 00:45:40.359 align:start position:0%
whether they accounted for other factors
 
00:45:43.270 --> 00:45:43.280 align:start position:0%
that may have uh impacted the outcomes
 
00:45:45.109 --> 00:45:45.119 align:start position:0%
or have they established a causal
 
00:45:46.950 --> 00:45:46.960 align:start position:0%
relationship between the building
 
00:45:48.390 --> 00:45:48.400 align:start position:0%
because frankly it's kind of hard to
 
00:45:50.950 --> 00:45:50.960 align:start position:0%
believe that if I put the same exact
 
00:45:52.589 --> 00:45:52.599 align:start position:0%
teachers and students in a different
 
00:45:54.750 --> 00:45:54.760 align:start position:0%
building academic performance shoots up
 
00:45:57.630 --> 00:45:57.640 align:start position:0%
by 20% or the number you quoted
 
00:45:59.030 --> 00:45:59.040 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for that
 
00:46:01.470 --> 00:46:01.480 align:start position:0%
question this report um and I I will
 
00:46:03.109 --> 00:46:03.119 align:start position:0%
submit it to you you can look it up
 
00:46:06.630 --> 00:46:06.640 align:start position:0%
online it's 80 page it's it's many many
 
00:46:08.670 --> 00:46:08.680 align:start position:0%
many pages like we we do have a copy of
 
00:46:11.069 --> 00:46:11.079 align:start position:0%
that report we've had it before and and
 
00:46:13.109 --> 00:46:13.119 align:start position:0%
there's a direct
 
00:46:17.390 --> 00:46:17.400 align:start position:0%
relationship between lighting sound
 
00:46:21.430 --> 00:46:21.440 align:start position:0%
heating all that to the learning of a
 
00:46:23.790 --> 00:46:23.800 align:start position:0%
student in school it's between five and
 
00:46:25.910 --> 00:46:25.920 align:start position:0%
15 percentage points as you mentioned
 
00:46:27.589 --> 00:46:27.599 align:start position:0%
but we have those report reports those
 
00:46:29.829 --> 00:46:29.839 align:start position:0%
reports not just this one but they date
 
00:46:33.349 --> 00:46:33.359 align:start position:0%
back for a good 15 20 years we will have
 
00:46:35.230 --> 00:46:35.240 align:start position:0%
that thank you Mr
 
00:46:38.750 --> 00:46:38.760 align:start position:0%
chairman further questions represent
 
00:46:43.549 --> 00:46:43.559 align:start position:0%
Ames you newbies on this commit for the
 
00:46:46.630 --> 00:46:46.640 align:start position:0%
newbies on this committee Could you um
 
00:46:49.390 --> 00:46:49.400 align:start position:0%
could someone provide us with the link

applications for building Aid that may
 
00:47:58.150 --> 00:47:58.160 align:start position:0%
have uh you know during the moror period
 
00:48:01.069 --> 00:48:01.079 align:start position:0%
and and and I guess this is just I I
 
00:48:02.990 --> 00:48:03.000 align:start position:0%
don't know the answer to this are were
 
00:48:05.030 --> 00:48:05.040 align:start position:0%
there applications for uh for building
 
00:48:06.829 --> 00:48:06.839 align:start position:0%
Aid projects submitted to the state
 
00:48:11.069 --> 00:48:11.079 align:start position:0%
during the moratorium period and um and
 
00:48:14.150 --> 00:48:14.160 align:start position:0%
how I guess how did the department act
 
00:48:18.390 --> 00:48:18.400 align:start position:0%
on um on those if if such applications
 
00:48:21.750 --> 00:48:21.760 align:start position:0%
were submitted yeah so thank you for the
 
00:48:24.030 --> 00:48:24.040 align:start position:0%
question um a little background I'm in
 
00:48:27.430 --> 00:48:27.440 align:start position:0%
my second week in this position and so I
 
00:48:29.150 --> 00:48:29.160 align:start position:0%
I've been with the department for a bit
 
00:48:30.589 --> 00:48:30.599 align:start position:0%
so I do have a little bit of knowledge
 
00:48:32.230 --> 00:48:32.240 align:start position:0%
but no exact knowledge on the your
 
00:48:35.349 --> 00:48:35.359 align:start position:0%
specific question I know that during
 
00:48:38.030 --> 00:48:38.040 align:start position:0%
moratorium many schools did not submit
 
00:48:39.870 --> 00:48:39.880 align:start position:0%
applications because there was an
 
00:48:42.510 --> 00:48:42.520 align:start position:0%
established moratorium um I can't speak
 
00:48:45.069 --> 00:48:45.079 align:start position:0%
to year toe if schools went ahead and
 
00:48:47.470 --> 00:48:47.480 align:start position:0%
submitted applications or not despite
 
00:48:48.549 --> 00:48:48.559 align:start position:0%
there being a
 
00:48:51.750 --> 00:48:51.760 align:start position:0%
moratorium so we are aware and Amy which
 
00:48:53.270 --> 00:48:53.280 align:start position:0%
uh the chair did mention Amy Clark the
 
00:48:55.589 --> 00:48:55.599 align:start position:0%
prior engineer did put together a list
 
00:48:58.549 --> 00:48:58.559 align:start position:0%
of projects uh School building projects
 
00:49:01.589 --> 00:49:01.599 align:start position:0%
that occurred from 2009 to
 
00:49:04.549 --> 00:49:04.559 align:start position:0%
2019 I do not know whether or not all of
 
00:49:06.109 --> 00:49:06.119 align:start position:0%
those projects are only some of those
 
00:49:07.510 --> 00:49:07.520 align:start position:0%
projects or any of those projects
 
00:49:11.030 --> 00:49:11.040 align:start position:0%
submitted an actual application or not
 
00:49:13.349 --> 00:49:13.359 align:start position:0%
okay we did approve one emergency
 
00:49:15.150 --> 00:49:15.160 align:start position:0%
project and towards the end of the
 
00:49:17.270 --> 00:49:17.280 align:start position:0%
moratorium some districts started wising
 
00:49:19.990 --> 00:49:20.000 align:start position:0%
up and put their applications in and
 
00:49:22.710 --> 00:49:22.720 align:start position:0%
three eventually received
 
00:49:27.109 --> 00:49:27.119 align:start position:0%
funding further Prof Burton just a uh a
 
00:49:30.990 --> 00:49:31.000 align:start position:0%
note um we built a new bu Middle School
 
00:49:34.829 --> 00:49:34.839 align:start position:0%
in Oyster River for $50 million on a
 
00:49:39.510 --> 00:49:39.520 align:start position:0%
76% approval vote um we insisted because
 
00:49:42.030 --> 00:49:42.040 align:start position:0%
all of our public buildings are now zero
 
00:49:45.069 --> 00:49:45.079 align:start position:0%
net buildings that it be that school is
 
00:49:47.430 --> 00:49:47.440 align:start position:0%
a zero net building no one's mentioned
 
00:49:49.150 --> 00:49:49.160 align:start position:0%
the fact and maybe you can Enlighten us
 
00:49:52.230 --> 00:49:52.240 align:start position:0%
how much an operating cost do you save
 
00:49:54.309 --> 00:49:54.319 align:start position:0%
by having a new
 
00:49:56.670 --> 00:49:56.680 align:start position:0%
facility thank you for the question
 
00:49:57.829 --> 00:49:57.839 align:start position:0%

00:50:00.710 --> 00:50:00.720 align:start position:0%
information yet um again being new to
 
00:50:04.270 --> 00:50:04.280 align:start position:0%

Charter Public School eligibility for
 
00:50:33.430 --> 00:50:33.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:36.910 --> 00:50:36.920 align:start position:0%
program and I'd like to recognize
 
00:50:41.430 --> 00:50:41.440 align:start position:0%
represent kahill thank you Mr chair uh
 
00:50:43.710 --> 00:50:43.720 align:start position:0%

00:50:45.150 --> 00:50:45.160 align:start position:0%
moment just to answer a couple of things
 
00:50:49.670 --> 00:50:49.680 align:start position:0%
that came in in the preceding bill um no
 
00:50:50.910 --> 00:50:50.920 align:start position:0%
I'd like to have you just going cuz
 
00:50:53.270 --> 00:50:53.280 align:start position:0%
we're getting way behind here I'm sorry

so let's move right on with uh 5:15 okay
 
00:50:59.510 --> 00:50:59.520 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much uh
 
00:51:02.430 --> 00:51:02.440 align:start position:0%
515 is a bill that would repeal the
 
00:51:04.349 --> 00:51:04.359 align:start position:0%
eligibility for charted schools this was
 
00:51:08.589 --> 00:51:08.599 align:start position:0%
passed last year and the reason I
 
00:51:10.870 --> 00:51:10.880 align:start position:0%
opposed that that bill and the reason
 
00:51:13.589 --> 00:51:13.599 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to repeal it now is I think
 
00:51:15.390 --> 00:51:15.400 align:start position:0%
you've heard in the testimony in the
 
00:51:17.829 --> 00:51:17.839 align:start position:0%
previous Bill we don't have the
 
00:51:20.069 --> 00:51:20.079 align:start position:0%
money uh we haven't been meeting the
 
00:51:23.309 --> 00:51:23.319 align:start position:0%
needs of the traditional Public Schools
 
00:51:25.190 --> 00:51:25.200 align:start position:0%
uh there's a long backlog it's going to
 
00:51:27.190 --> 00:51:27.200 align:start position:0%
take money and time
 
00:51:30.030 --> 00:51:30.040 align:start position:0%
and adding to that the chartered
 
00:51:34.670 --> 00:51:34.680 align:start position:0%
schools uh will take more money than we
 
00:51:34.680 --> 00:51:38.270 align:start position:0%
schools uh will take more money than we
have

00:51:38.270 --> 00:51:38.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:41.750 --> 00:51:41.760 align:start position:0%
um I I did send you all a link to that
 
00:51:45.789 --> 00:51:45.799 align:start position:0%
uh to the to the uh floor debate and I
 
00:51:47.309 --> 00:51:47.319 align:start position:0%
wanted to bring out a couple of points
 
00:51:50.870 --> 00:51:50.880 align:start position:0%
with that in that uh representative
 
00:51:55.870 --> 00:51:55.880 align:start position:0%
luno ran through some of the concerns uh
 
00:51:55.880 --> 00:51:57.150 align:start position:0%
luno ran through some of the concerns uh
about

00:51:57.150 --> 00:51:57.160 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:52:00.069 --> 00:52:00.079 align:start position:0%
the condition of our of our schools and
 
00:52:02.430 --> 00:52:02.440 align:start position:0%
that we did in fact you know have that
 
00:52:06.349 --> 00:52:06.359 align:start position:0%
obligation and that uh Charters you know
 
00:52:09.589 --> 00:52:09.599 align:start position:0%
Charters do have other sources of of uh
 
00:52:12.150 --> 00:52:12.160 align:start position:0%
Revenue uh I'm thinking of the uh
 
00:52:15.750 --> 00:52:15.760 align:start position:0%
lionart School uh which is done by a
 
00:52:17.789 --> 00:52:17.799 align:start position:0%
venture capitalist here in New Hampshire
 
00:52:20.230 --> 00:52:20.240 align:start position:0%
somewhere uh bought a building to set up
 
00:52:22.349 --> 00:52:22.359 align:start position:0%
a Char of school got naming rights for
 
00:52:24.990 --> 00:52:25.000 align:start position:0%
it um and there are other organizations
 
00:52:27.190 --> 00:52:27.200 align:start position:0%
that are you know it's sort of like a a
 
00:52:30.670 --> 00:52:30.680 align:start position:0%
franchise I think I've seen where this
 
00:52:33.670 --> 00:52:33.680 align:start position:0%
privatization but as I've stated we we
 
00:52:36.109 --> 00:52:36.119 align:start position:0%
don't have the money we are we have
 
00:52:40.150 --> 00:52:40.160 align:start position:0%
burdened uh communities who did apply
 
00:52:41.990 --> 00:52:42.000 align:start position:0%
who could not apply their applications
 
00:52:44.710 --> 00:52:44.720 align:start position:0%
were they couldn't put an application
 
00:52:46.829 --> 00:52:46.839 align:start position:0%
and we have those schools that are still
 
00:52:49.109 --> 00:52:49.119 align:start position:0%
waiting and there are many more because
 
00:52:50.670 --> 00:52:50.680 align:start position:0%
as as you know we have yet to pass a
 
00:52:53.150 --> 00:52:53.160 align:start position:0%
bill that would allow us to really good
 
00:52:54.910 --> 00:52:54.920 align:start position:0%
get a good assessment of how many
 
00:52:56.510 --> 00:52:56.520 align:start position:0%
schools are out there and what they
 
00:52:58.789 --> 00:52:58.799 align:start position:0%
conditions are that was I think this I
 
00:53:00.950 --> 00:53:00.960 align:start position:0%
think the other body put your bill into
 
00:53:03.630 --> 00:53:03.640 align:start position:0%
uh uh interim study or whatever their
 
00:53:06.710 --> 00:53:06.720 align:start position:0%
polite term is uh but I wanted to draw
 
00:53:09.270 --> 00:53:09.280 align:start position:0%
your attention to the to that debate
 
00:53:13.109 --> 00:53:13.119 align:start position:0%
where representative McDonald spoke you
 
00:53:15.910 --> 00:53:15.920 align:start position:0%
know eloquently and passionately about
 
00:53:18.470 --> 00:53:18.480 align:start position:0%
extending the eligibility to Charter
 
00:53:22.069 --> 00:53:22.079 align:start position:0%
Schools and she used the word
 
00:53:24.589 --> 00:53:24.599 align:start position:0%
always the traditional Public Schools
 
00:53:27.630 --> 00:53:27.640 align:start position:0%
could always apply
 
00:53:27.640 --> 00:53:29.390 align:start position:0%
could always apply
and

00:53:29.390 --> 00:53:29.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:53:33.910 --> 00:53:33.920 align:start position:0%
always uh invariably without exception
 
00:53:36.670 --> 00:53:36.680 align:start position:0%
that's what that means and these lists
 
00:53:39.549 --> 00:53:39.559 align:start position:0%
that I presented to you indicate that
 
00:53:42.430 --> 00:53:42.440 align:start position:0%
that's not the case we don't always get
 
00:53:45.150 --> 00:53:45.160 align:start position:0%
the money we can't even always apply as
 
00:53:46.470 --> 00:53:46.480 align:start position:0%
in during the
 
00:53:49.150 --> 00:53:49.160 align:start position:0%
moratorium uh I know that the new market
 
00:53:50.990 --> 00:53:51.000 align:start position:0%
School Board worked closely with Amy
 
00:53:53.349 --> 00:53:53.359 align:start position:0%
Clark to make sure that we were kind of
 
00:53:55.270 --> 00:53:55.280 align:start position:0%
in line with what the expectations were
 
00:53:58.150 --> 00:53:58.160 align:start position:0%
but we couldn't do an application
 
00:54:02.270 --> 00:54:02.280 align:start position:0%
so uh again you have people who are
 
00:54:03.510 --> 00:54:03.520 align:start position:0%
thinking that this you know I know in
 
00:54:05.030 --> 00:54:05.040 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire we talk a lot about needs
 
00:54:07.510 --> 00:54:07.520 align:start position:0%
and wants and we have to make sure we
 
00:54:09.870 --> 00:54:09.880 align:start position:0%
take care of our needs first and the
 
00:54:13.069 --> 00:54:13.079 align:start position:0%
needs are demonstrated across the state
 
00:54:14.630 --> 00:54:14.640 align:start position:0%
in our traditional public school
 
00:54:17.829 --> 00:54:17.839 align:start position:0%
buildings uh we talk the the prior a
 
00:54:20.510 --> 00:54:20.520 align:start position:0%
prior witness talked about uh 40 years
 
00:54:22.510 --> 00:54:22.520 align:start position:0%
is a long time long shelf life for a
 
00:54:25.069 --> 00:54:25.079 align:start position:0%
building uh our our high school was
 
00:54:29.990 --> 00:54:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:33.750 --> 00:54:33.760 align:start position:0%
1925 I mean as old as Jimmy
 
00:54:35.670 --> 00:54:35.680 align:start position:0%
Carter and you know we've done some
 
00:54:38.829 --> 00:54:38.839 align:start position:0%
additions to it over the years and our
 
00:54:40.950 --> 00:54:40.960 align:start position:0%
elementary was fairly new I think in the
 
00:54:43.750 --> 00:54:43.760 align:start position:0%
late 70s or early 80s but then we had
 
00:54:45.910 --> 00:54:45.920 align:start position:0%
the you know the New Hampshire miracle
 
00:54:47.390 --> 00:54:47.400 align:start position:0%
and all of a sudden we had a lot more
 
00:54:50.109 --> 00:54:50.119 align:start position:0%
kids we had put in uh MERS that were
 
00:54:52.309 --> 00:54:52.319 align:start position:0%
there for 30 years before we could pass
 
00:54:54.950 --> 00:54:54.960 align:start position:0%
a war article to build real classrooms I
 
00:54:57.309 --> 00:54:57.319 align:start position:0%
know in Nottingham there there another
 
00:54:59.670 --> 00:54:59.680 align:start position:0%
another another school that's uh running
 
00:55:02.829 --> 00:55:02.839 align:start position:0%
out of space modular it's it's not an
 
00:55:05.789 --> 00:55:05.799 align:start position:0%
answer I I I learned recently about the
 
00:55:08.030 --> 00:55:08.040 align:start position:0%
uh the commission on school public
 
00:55:10.750 --> 00:55:10.760 align:start position:0%
school infrastructure and that we did
 
00:55:13.670 --> 00:55:13.680 align:start position:0%
you did get some co uh some uh Cobra
 
00:55:17.270 --> 00:55:17.280 align:start position:0%
money I'm not Cobra gopher money uh to
 
00:55:20.710 --> 00:55:20.720 align:start position:0%
do to do some work on security how are
 
00:55:23.510 --> 00:55:23.520 align:start position:0%
you going to have security for modular
 
00:55:26.029 --> 00:55:26.039 align:start position:0%
classrooms so we're going in you know
 
00:55:27.710 --> 00:55:27.720 align:start position:0%
we're doing little bits here and there
 
00:55:29.910 --> 00:55:29.920 align:start position:0%
we we're trying to get internet in rural
 
00:55:31.670 --> 00:55:31.680 align:start position:0%
areas we're trying to do bulletproof
 
00:55:35.589 --> 00:55:35.599 align:start position:0%
glass on schools uh this isn't really
 
00:55:37.789 --> 00:55:37.799 align:start position:0%
necessarily all what we should be doing
 
00:55:40.029 --> 00:55:40.039 align:start position:0%
we should be assuming making sure that
 
00:55:44.109 --> 00:55:44.119 align:start position:0%
we have a decent solid safe efficient
 
00:55:47.670 --> 00:55:47.680 align:start position:0%
classroom environment for our
 
00:55:50.470 --> 00:55:50.480 align:start position:0%
students and we're we haven't done that
 
00:55:52.789 --> 00:55:52.799 align:start position:0%
yet so that's why I keep on bringing
 
00:55:54.829 --> 00:55:54.839 align:start position:0%
back this bill I I know that Mr Maguire
 
00:55:58.029 --> 00:55:58.039 align:start position:0%
is probably a little fatigue but we we
 
00:55:59.910 --> 00:55:59.920 align:start position:0%
have talked about it and I I appreciate
 
00:56:01.950 --> 00:56:01.960 align:start position:0%
your patience and as well as the other
 
00:56:03.990 --> 00:56:04.000 align:start position:0%
members of the committee uh who may be
 
00:56:06.910 --> 00:56:06.920 align:start position:0%
new to this but it's an issue that we we
 
00:56:09.870 --> 00:56:09.880 align:start position:0%
need to do something and we cannot
 
00:56:12.710 --> 00:56:12.720 align:start position:0%
spread our thin resources further by
 
00:56:15.470 --> 00:56:15.480 align:start position:0%
adding the 30 Charter Schools or
 
00:56:17.910 --> 00:56:17.920 align:start position:0%
whatever number might be uh whatever in
 
00:56:22.150 --> 00:56:22.160 align:start position:0%
the next I I know we uh we took uh $47
 
00:56:25.549 --> 00:56:25.559 align:start position:0%
million from uh the feds to double the
 
00:56:27.150 --> 00:56:27.160 align:start position:0%
number of charart schools not that we
 
00:56:30.470 --> 00:56:30.480 align:start position:0%
needed them but the money was there and
 
00:56:32.470 --> 00:56:32.480 align:start position:0%
our our traditional Public Schools do
 
00:56:35.109 --> 00:56:35.119 align:start position:0%
serve the vast majority of our students
 
00:56:37.150 --> 00:56:37.160 align:start position:0%
our families our communities our
 
00:56:39.910 --> 00:56:39.920 align:start position:0%
business looking for educated Workforce
 
00:56:41.910 --> 00:56:41.920 align:start position:0%
they were doing the job we didn't need
 
00:56:44.029 --> 00:56:44.039 align:start position:0%
to bring Charters here they have their
 
00:56:47.190 --> 00:56:47.200 align:start position:0%
place but they don't have to be every
 
00:56:49.910 --> 00:56:49.920 align:start position:0%
place I'm gladly take any questions
 
00:56:51.470 --> 00:56:51.480 align:start position:0%
thank you other questions represent
 
00:56:53.630 --> 00:56:53.640 align:start position:0%
McGuire thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
00:56:56.630 --> 00:56:56.640 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um section s s of
 
00:56:59.710 --> 00:56:59.720 align:start position:0%
your bill on page four line
 
00:57:03.029 --> 00:57:03.039 align:start position:0%
35 um it's deleting a paragraph that has
 
00:57:05.630 --> 00:57:05.640 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with school building Aid
 
00:57:09.390 --> 00:57:09.400 align:start position:0%
it it's just about um school records and
 
00:57:11.109 --> 00:57:11.119 align:start position:0%
and so on is that just in there
 
00:57:14.069 --> 00:57:14.079 align:start position:0%
inadvertently uh I think it probably is
 
00:57:18.950 --> 00:57:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:21.950 --> 00:57:21.960 align:start position:0%
confession further questions from the
 
00:57:24.789 --> 00:57:24.799 align:start position:0%
committee yes represent luno thank you
 
00:57:26.430 --> 00:57:26.440 align:start position:0%
very much Mr chair thank you very much
 
00:57:28.510 --> 00:57:28.520 align:start position:0%
again I represent kale you referenced
 
00:57:31.109 --> 00:57:31.119 align:start position:0%
the uh the federal Charter um expansion
 
00:57:33.470 --> 00:57:33.480 align:start position:0%
Grant the $47 million and I know the
 
00:57:35.950 --> 00:57:35.960 align:start position:0%
state hasn't received the whole chunk of
 
00:57:38.349 --> 00:57:38.359 align:start position:0%
that but um but can those dollars be
 
00:57:42.750 --> 00:57:42.760 align:start position:0%
used for um for uh facilities uh I I
 
00:57:45.309 --> 00:57:45.319 align:start position:0%
believe they're used for startup costs
 
00:57:48.109 --> 00:57:48.119 align:start position:0%
and I know we we give a we provide lease
 
00:57:50.710 --> 00:57:50.720 align:start position:0%
we financial assistance for leases which
 
00:57:52.789 --> 00:57:52.799 align:start position:0%
I think could be included I don't know
 
00:57:55.270 --> 00:57:55.280 align:start position:0%
whether or not uh they could use those
 
00:57:57.309 --> 00:57:57.319 align:start position:0%
funds to ire a building but certainly
 
00:57:59.150 --> 00:57:59.160 align:start position:0%
they can lease an
 
00:58:01.829 --> 00:58:01.839 align:start position:0%
abandon uh Shopping Center or wherever
 
00:58:05.069 --> 00:58:05.079 align:start position:0%
they put the schools uh and again that's
 
00:58:06.589 --> 00:58:06.599 align:start position:0%
kind of that's kind of a string I know
 
00:58:08.390 --> 00:58:08.400 align:start position:0%
we don't like strings attached from
 
00:58:10.109 --> 00:58:10.119 align:start position:0%
Washington but that was a
 
00:58:13.390 --> 00:58:13.400 align:start position:0%
rope great thank you further questions
 
00:58:15.069 --> 00:58:15.079 align:start position:0%

School eligibility for state school
 
00:59:28.910 --> 00:59:28.920 align:start position:0%
building Aid by means of background I
 
00:59:32.230 --> 00:59:32.240 align:start position:0%
was the Prime sponsor of the bill to
 
00:59:35.549 --> 00:59:35.559 align:start position:0%
include public charter schools in the
 
00:59:37.950 --> 00:59:37.960 align:start position:0%
application process this is about the
 
00:59:40.829 --> 00:59:40.839 align:start position:0%
application process for school building
 
00:59:44.190 --> 00:59:44.200 align:start position:0%
Aid that bill that I prime sponsored was
 
00:59:47.069 --> 00:59:47.079 align:start position:0%
just last term House Bill
 
00:59:50.829 --> 00:59:50.839 align:start position:0%
354 introduced in
 
00:59:54.589 --> 00:59:54.599 align:start position:0%
2023 House Bill 354 which will be the
 
00:59:56.990 --> 00:59:57.000 align:start position:0%
focus of my testimony considering House
 
01:00:00.589 --> 01:00:00.599 align:start position:0%
Bill 515 wants to repeal all of it was
 
01:00:03.990 --> 01:00:04.000 align:start position:0%
signed into law less than a year ago
 
01:00:06.109 --> 01:00:06.119 align:start position:0%
June 14th
 
01:00:10.829 --> 01:00:10.839 align:start position:0%
2024 and that signature came after an
 
01:00:14.750 --> 01:00:14.760 align:start position:0%
entire year of the House Education
 
01:00:17.069 --> 01:00:17.079 align:start position:0%
committee chaired by your
 
01:00:21.670 --> 01:00:21.680 align:start position:0%
chairman to review it study it ask
 
01:00:26.630 --> 01:00:26.640 align:start position:0%
questions amend it very carefully
 
01:00:28.549 --> 01:00:28.559 align:start position:0%
after that full year of review the house
 
01:00:30.549 --> 01:00:30.559 align:start position:0%
voted ought to pass with Amendment on a
 
01:00:33.109 --> 01:00:33.119 align:start position:0%
roll call 190 to
 
01:00:36.309 --> 01:00:36.319 align:start position:0%
177 on January 4th
 
01:00:39.150 --> 01:00:39.160 align:start position:0%
2024 and then the full Senate voted
 
01:00:44.270 --> 01:00:44.280 align:start position:0%
ought to pass on a Voice vote May 2nd
 
01:00:48.750 --> 01:00:48.760 align:start position:0%
2024 here's a synopsis three main points
 
01:00:53.349 --> 01:00:53.359 align:start position:0%
that house bill 354 did first of all it
 
01:00:56.910 --> 01:00:56.920 align:start position:0%
corrected a glaring contrib iction in
 
01:01:00.670 --> 01:01:00.680 align:start position:0%
the law there was a section of law that
 
01:01:02.430 --> 01:01:02.440 align:start position:0%
said Point
 
01:01:05.069 --> 01:01:05.079 align:start position:0%
Blank public charter schools don't
 
01:01:07.829 --> 01:01:07.839 align:start position:0%
receive building Aid and then an
 
01:01:11.150 --> 01:01:11.160 align:start position:0%
entirely other section of law that said
 
01:01:13.230 --> 01:01:13.240 align:start position:0%
well they do and it's in my testimony
 
01:01:15.309 --> 01:01:15.319 align:start position:0%
under number one but the amount of the
 
01:01:17.109 --> 01:01:17.119 align:start position:0%
grant to any chartered Public School
 
01:01:19.990 --> 01:01:20.000 align:start position:0%
shall be 30% of the eligible cost of
 
01:01:23.510 --> 01:01:23.520 align:start position:0%
construction well which is it as a side
 
01:01:26.029 --> 01:01:26.039 align:start position:0%
note I sit on house finance and there
 
01:01:28.950 --> 01:01:28.960 align:start position:0%
was a bill to have an attorney be hired
 
01:01:31.069 --> 01:01:31.079 align:start position:0%
for the Department of Ed to go through
 
01:01:34.029 --> 01:01:34.039 align:start position:0%
the hundreds of rsas and House Education
 
01:01:36.349 --> 01:01:36.359 align:start position:0%
I mean in education law and look for
 
01:01:38.069 --> 01:01:38.079 align:start position:0%
discrepancies and you know what it was
 
01:01:41.109 --> 01:01:41.119 align:start position:0%
that they used as the example for that
 
01:01:44.510 --> 01:01:44.520 align:start position:0%
position this very contradiction related
 
01:01:48.190 --> 01:01:48.200 align:start position:0%
to building aid for public charter
 
01:01:52.789 --> 01:01:52.799 align:start position:0%
schools synopsis point2 The Bill simply
 
01:01:55.950 --> 01:01:55.960 align:start position:0%
allows public charter schools to apply
 
01:02:00.950 --> 01:02:00.960 align:start position:0%
not get apply like any other school that
 
01:02:04.349 --> 01:02:04.359 align:start position:0%
wants to apply for public uh Aid
 
01:02:07.470 --> 01:02:07.480 align:start position:0%
building Aid uh to be included in that
 
01:02:09.430 --> 01:02:09.440 align:start position:0%
application process just like any other
 
01:02:11.510 --> 01:02:11.520 align:start position:0%
traditional Public School
 
01:02:15.990 --> 01:02:16.000 align:start position:0%
can and then in my synopsis number three
 
01:02:19.069 --> 01:02:19.079 align:start position:0%
there are parameters around this it's
 
01:02:20.470 --> 01:02:20.480 align:start position:0%
not a
 
01:02:23.910 --> 01:02:23.920 align:start position:0%
blanket uh the first is that the public
 
01:02:26.190 --> 01:02:26.200 align:start position:0%
charter school that applies for the a
 
01:02:29.190 --> 01:02:29.200 align:start position:0%
must own its own building own its own
 
01:02:32.069 --> 01:02:32.079 align:start position:0%
building so that's not everybody in fact
 
01:02:34.029 --> 01:02:34.039 align:start position:0%
that's um the department of Ed can
 
01:02:36.829 --> 01:02:36.839 align:start position:0%
clarify this I think don't quote but
 
01:02:39.630 --> 01:02:39.640 align:start position:0%
it's around 11 schools that would even
 
01:02:42.910 --> 01:02:42.920 align:start position:0%
be eligible to apply for this building
 
01:02:44.750 --> 01:02:44.760 align:start position:0%
Aid because they own their own
 
01:02:47.390 --> 01:02:47.400 align:start position:0%
buildings the grant payment is spread
 
01:02:50.470 --> 01:02:50.480 align:start position:0%
out over a typical loan term that's very
 
01:02:51.789 --> 01:02:51.799 align:start position:0%
different than the traditional public
 
01:02:53.870 --> 01:02:53.880 align:start position:0%
school that would apply for school
 
01:02:57.230 --> 01:02:57.240 align:start position:0%
building Aid and thirdly and this was
 
01:02:58.750 --> 01:02:58.760 align:start position:0%
part of the amendment that the house
 
01:03:02.150 --> 01:03:02.160 align:start position:0%
education committee proposed last term
 
01:03:04.630 --> 01:03:04.640 align:start position:0%
the chartered school must have its asset
 
01:03:07.269 --> 01:03:07.279 align:start position:0%
disposition plan approved by the State
 
01:03:08.670 --> 01:03:08.680 align:start position:0%
Board of
 
01:03:12.789 --> 01:03:12.799 align:start position:0%
Education so this law currently that
 
01:03:14.670 --> 01:03:14.680 align:start position:0%
came from House Bill
 
01:03:17.470 --> 01:03:17.480 align:start position:0%
354 allows the public charter school
 
01:03:19.549 --> 01:03:19.559 align:start position:0%
that owns it its own building the option
 
01:03:22.549 --> 01:03:22.559 align:start position:0%
of applying but there are very strict
 
01:03:25.430 --> 01:03:25.440 align:start position:0%
parameters around it that were crafted
 
01:03:27.789 --> 01:03:27.799 align:start position:0%
by the House Education Committee just
 
01:03:27.799 --> 01:03:29.309 align:start position:0%
by the House Education Committee just
last

01:03:29.309 --> 01:03:29.319 align:start position:0%
last
 
01:03:32.390 --> 01:03:32.400 align:start position:0%
term House Bill 354 has been signed into
 
01:03:34.269 --> 01:03:34.279 align:start position:0%
law less than one year ago for the
 
01:03:36.190 --> 01:03:36.200 align:start position:0%
reasons stated in my testimony I
 
01:03:38.910 --> 01:03:38.920 align:start position:0%
recommend that you recommend House Bill
 
01:03:42.230 --> 01:03:42.240 align:start position:0%
515 inexpedient to legislate and with
 
01:03:44.069 --> 01:03:44.079 align:start position:0%
that I'll conclude my testimony and I
 
01:03:45.990 --> 01:03:46.000 align:start position:0%
thank you all for your attention thank
 
01:03:47.390 --> 01:03:47.400 align:start position:0%
you thank you very much representative
 
01:03:49.670 --> 01:03:49.680 align:start position:0%
Mooney are there questions from the
 
01:03:51.870 --> 01:03:51.880 align:start position:0%
committee yes representative Maguire
 
01:03:54.230 --> 01:03:54.240 align:start position:0%
then representative fellows thank you Mr
 
01:03:55.910 --> 01:03:55.920 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you representative for
 
01:03:56.910 --> 01:03:56.920 align:start position:0%
taking my
 
01:03:58.750 --> 01:03:58.760 align:start position:0%
question I'm wondering about this
 
01:04:00.950 --> 01:04:00.960 align:start position:0%
provision that they must own their own
 
01:04:03.829 --> 01:04:03.839 align:start position:0%
building wouldn't a charter school that
 
01:04:06.870 --> 01:04:06.880 align:start position:0%
leases space be more likely to want to
 
01:04:08.470 --> 01:04:08.480 align:start position:0%
build a new you know get rid of the
 
01:04:09.950 --> 01:04:09.960 align:start position:0%
lease and build a new building and
 
01:04:11.470 --> 01:04:11.480 align:start position:0%
shouldn't they be
 
01:04:15.150 --> 01:04:15.160 align:start position:0%
eligible a very good point um there is
 
01:04:17.670 --> 01:04:17.680 align:start position:0%
lease Aid available for Charter Schools
 
01:04:19.630 --> 01:04:19.640 align:start position:0%
that's something separate in fact I was
 
01:04:23.069 --> 01:04:23.079 align:start position:0%
uh responsible for increasing that but
 
01:04:25.789 --> 01:04:25.799 align:start position:0%
uh with regards to your question I leave
 
01:04:27.589 --> 01:04:27.599 align:start position:0%
it to the house education committee from
 
01:04:29.789 --> 01:04:29.799 align:start position:0%
last term they spent an entire year
 
01:04:32.510 --> 01:04:32.520 align:start position:0%
reviewing and carefully amending this
 
01:04:35.069 --> 01:04:35.079 align:start position:0%
bill and decided to go in the direction
 
01:04:37.309 --> 01:04:37.319 align:start position:0%
that it did as opposed to what you
 
01:04:40.549 --> 01:04:40.559 align:start position:0%
suggest thank representative fellows uh
 
01:04:43.430 --> 01:04:43.440 align:start position:0%
thank you um my question is about your
 
01:04:47.069 --> 01:04:47.079 align:start position:0%
statement that 11 schools own their
 
01:04:51.870 --> 01:04:51.880 align:start position:0%
building um which may be true but in
 
01:04:54.789 --> 01:04:54.799 align:start position:0%
their disposition plan that's part of
 
01:04:56.150 --> 01:04:56.160 align:start position:0%
their Charter
 
01:04:59.750 --> 01:04:59.760 align:start position:0%
it or part of their plan that building
 
01:05:02.230 --> 01:05:02.240 align:start position:0%
there may be specifications that that
 
01:05:05.269 --> 01:05:05.279 align:start position:0%
building reverts to whomever gave them
 
01:05:10.430 --> 01:05:10.440 align:start position:0%
that building initially so it's not the
 
01:05:12.990 --> 01:05:13.000 align:start position:0%
normal kind of ownership that you would
 
01:05:15.470 --> 01:05:15.480 align:start position:0%
see when people own houses and and ask
 
01:05:17.990 --> 01:05:18.000 align:start position:0%
for a loan to make um improvements on
 
01:05:20.750 --> 01:05:20.760 align:start position:0%
the loan so can you respond
 
01:05:24.430 --> 01:05:24.440 align:start position:0%
to the issue that maybe what they're
 
01:05:29.789 --> 01:05:29.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:32.990 --> 01:05:33.000 align:start position:0%
property in the state gave them money to
 
01:05:35.670 --> 01:05:35.680 align:start position:0%
fix it up or build in thank you for the
 
01:05:38.109 --> 01:05:38.119 align:start position:0%
question I would simply say that um what
 
01:05:40.670 --> 01:05:40.680 align:start position:0%
was agreed upon last year through a very
 
01:05:42.710 --> 01:05:42.720 align:start position:0%
thorough amendment process was the word
 
01:05:45.430 --> 01:05:45.440 align:start position:0%
own uh the logistics of that maybe could
 
01:05:47.549 --> 01:05:47.559 align:start position:0%
be fleshed out further i' be open to
 
01:05:51.710 --> 01:05:51.720 align:start position:0%
that um but I do see your your point
 
01:05:54.349 --> 01:05:54.359 align:start position:0%
Thank you further questions representa
 
01:05:56.870 --> 01:05:56.880 align:start position:0%
luno uh thank you very much Mr chair and
 
01:05:58.589 --> 01:05:58.599 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative um I
 
01:05:59.870 --> 01:05:59.880 align:start position:0%
was wondering if you could talk to the
 
01:06:02.950 --> 01:06:02.960 align:start position:0%
committee a little bit about excuse me
 
01:06:02.960 --> 01:06:04.630 align:start position:0%
committee a little bit about excuse me
about

01:06:04.630 --> 01:06:04.640 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:06:07.950 --> 01:06:07.960 align:start position:0%
um excuse me um the um the number of
 
01:06:10.990 --> 01:06:11.000 align:start position:0%
charter schools that have over over the
 
01:06:12.670 --> 01:06:12.680 align:start position:0%
history that we've had them in New
 
01:06:13.870 --> 01:06:13.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the
 
01:06:17.470 --> 01:06:17.480 align:start position:0%
last couple decades is I believe since
 
01:06:21.510 --> 01:06:21.520 align:start position:0%
the 90s all right so so three decades um
 
01:06:24.549 --> 01:06:24.559 align:start position:0%
uh how many have um have either you know
 
01:06:27.190 --> 01:06:27.200 align:start position:0%
become insolvent whether that was due to
 
01:06:31.269 --> 01:06:31.279 align:start position:0%
um mismanagement or or you know um you
 
01:06:33.269 --> 01:06:33.279 align:start position:0%
know financial fraud or something like
 
01:06:35.470 --> 01:06:35.480 align:start position:0%
that I was wonder if you could just sort
 
01:06:37.829 --> 01:06:37.839 align:start position:0%
of put that in context to the number of
 
01:06:40.069 --> 01:06:40.079 align:start position:0%
charter schools that that we've had over
 
01:06:42.150 --> 01:06:42.160 align:start position:0%
that time thank you for that question
 
01:06:44.670 --> 01:06:44.680 align:start position:0%
that did come up last time and I know
 
01:06:46.990 --> 01:06:47.000 align:start position:0%
that all of the closings have been
 
01:06:49.190 --> 01:06:49.200 align:start position:0%
carefully documented I believe it's a
 
01:06:50.750 --> 01:06:50.760 align:start position:0%
public document and perhaps someone from
 
01:06:53.710 --> 01:06:53.720 align:start position:0%
the doe too could flesh this out but um
 
01:06:55.029 --> 01:06:55.039 align:start position:0%
my understanding I remember seeing the
 
01:06:57.109 --> 01:06:57.119 align:start position:0%
list last year it circulated during this
 
01:06:59.589 --> 01:06:59.599 align:start position:0%
very discussion not only did it list the
 
01:07:03.269 --> 01:07:03.279 align:start position:0%
school that had to close but the reason
 
01:07:05.670 --> 01:07:05.680 align:start position:0%
and I remember reasons such as uh
 
01:07:07.309 --> 01:07:07.319 align:start position:0%
finances and things of that nature but
 
01:07:10.269 --> 01:07:10.279 align:start position:0%
as I recall uh from a year ago or so the
 
01:07:13.510 --> 01:07:13.520 align:start position:0%
list it was maybe about 10 or or so I
 
01:07:16.190 --> 01:07:16.200 align:start position:0%
think in that ballpark that closed um
 
01:07:18.670 --> 01:07:18.680 align:start position:0%
and the the primary reason was a lack of
 
01:07:20.789 --> 01:07:20.799 align:start position:0%
fundraising and things of that nature
 
01:07:22.789 --> 01:07:22.799 align:start position:0%
and then follow up Mr chair that's my
 
01:07:24.950 --> 01:07:24.960 align:start position:0%
recollection yeah thanks and I think
 
01:07:27.230 --> 01:07:27.240 align:start position:0%
that's that's sort of along the lines of
 
01:07:30.670 --> 01:07:30.680 align:start position:0%
my recollection uh as well and and you
 
01:07:33.630 --> 01:07:33.640 align:start position:0%
know and I'm I'm interested in your your
 
01:07:36.829 --> 01:07:36.839 align:start position:0%
your thoughts to this particularly as a
 
01:07:39.710 --> 01:07:39.720 align:start position:0%
as a former Charter School administrator
 
01:07:43.269 --> 01:07:43.279 align:start position:0%
correct um um that that what recourse
 
01:07:46.589 --> 01:07:46.599 align:start position:0%
would the state have if it had invested
 
01:07:50.630 --> 01:07:50.640 align:start position:0%
taxpayer money in in a um in in building
 
01:07:52.710 --> 01:07:52.720 align:start position:0%
aid for charter school and then that
 
01:07:55.829 --> 01:07:55.839 align:start position:0%
charter school later became you know in
 
01:07:55.839 --> 01:07:56.870 align:start position:0%
charter school later became you know in
her

01:07:56.870 --> 01:07:56.880 align:start position:0%
her
 
01:08:00.109 --> 01:08:00.119 align:start position:0%
bankrupt well uh that's a a real big
 
01:08:03.470 --> 01:08:03.480 align:start position:0%
topic with regards to uh insolvency and
 
01:08:05.549 --> 01:08:05.559 align:start position:0%
closure and the process that the
 
01:08:08.910 --> 01:08:08.920 align:start position:0%
department of Ed then has to uh enact in
 
01:08:11.309 --> 01:08:11.319 align:start position:0%
order to handle this of the schools that
 
01:08:13.069 --> 01:08:13.079 align:start position:0%
were on that list for example I don't
 
01:08:15.470 --> 01:08:15.480 align:start position:0%
know who owned their own building if any
 
01:08:17.990 --> 01:08:18.000 align:start position:0%
did so I don't know to address that what
 
01:08:20.590 --> 01:08:20.600 align:start position:0%
the circumstances would have been I also
 
01:08:22.669 --> 01:08:22.679 align:start position:0%
U I'm not familiar with their Charters
 
01:08:24.349 --> 01:08:24.359 align:start position:0%
and I know that their Charters if
 
01:08:27.349 --> 01:08:27.359 align:start position:0%
they're done properly and the doe
 
01:08:30.349 --> 01:08:30.359 align:start position:0%
appropriately uh accepts them that they
 
01:08:32.470 --> 01:08:32.480 align:start position:0%
should have a disposition plan within
 
01:08:34.510 --> 01:08:34.520 align:start position:0%
each of them as to how the assets would
 
01:08:36.990 --> 01:08:37.000 align:start position:0%
break break up that should be all not
 
01:08:38.829 --> 01:08:38.839 align:start position:0%
only filed with the Department of Ed but
 
01:08:40.470 --> 01:08:40.480 align:start position:0%
very public and on every Charter
 
01:08:42.829 --> 01:08:42.839 align:start position:0%
School's website their Charter and a
 
01:08:45.110 --> 01:08:45.120 align:start position:0%
plan for disposition included in that
 
01:08:48.829 --> 01:08:48.839 align:start position:0%
Charter so I I hope that um begins to
 
01:08:50.189 --> 01:08:50.199 align:start position:0%
answer your question but you bring up a
 
01:08:53.709 --> 01:08:53.719 align:start position:0%
big topic yeah yeah and just a a really
 
01:08:56.550 --> 01:08:56.560 align:start position:0%
specific followup uh to to that Mr chair
 
01:08:59.349 --> 01:08:59.359 align:start position:0%
last one yeah yeah no appreciate it so
 
01:09:03.870 --> 01:09:03.880 align:start position:0%
so so so if if a charter with a within
 
01:09:06.309 --> 01:09:06.319 align:start position:0%
existing you know Charter approved by
 
01:09:09.149 --> 01:09:09.159 align:start position:0%
the state board were to receive a
 
01:09:14.030 --> 01:09:14.040 align:start position:0%
building aid grant would would would
 
01:09:14.040 --> 01:09:15.709 align:start position:0%
building aid grant would would would
they

01:09:15.709 --> 01:09:15.719 align:start position:0%
they
 
01:09:18.870 --> 01:09:18.880 align:start position:0%
be would would this bill require them or
 
01:09:21.149 --> 01:09:21.159 align:start position:0%
not this bill would the current law
 
01:09:24.590 --> 01:09:24.600 align:start position:0%
require them to update their Charter to
 
01:09:27.870 --> 01:09:27.880 align:start position:0%
be specific about the disposition of the
 
01:09:31.709 --> 01:09:31.719 align:start position:0%
state's Grant um and where it sits in
 
01:09:35.309 --> 01:09:35.319 align:start position:0%
line with with with other assets um
 
01:09:38.309 --> 01:09:38.319 align:start position:0%
during a uh during a bankruptcy or a
 
01:09:40.309 --> 01:09:40.319 align:start position:0%
dissolution uh thank you for that I
 
01:09:43.709 --> 01:09:43.719 align:start position:0%
would say to answer that um no the
 
01:09:46.269 --> 01:09:46.279 align:start position:0%
current law doesn't get that specific
 
01:09:48.070 --> 01:09:48.080 align:start position:0%
however I would hope that the department
 
01:09:50.030 --> 01:09:50.040 align:start position:0%
of Ed more specifically the Board of
 
01:09:52.229 --> 01:09:52.239 align:start position:0%
Education when they're hearing reviewing
 
01:09:55.070 --> 01:09:55.080 align:start position:0%
and approving these Charters would see
 
01:09:57.750 --> 01:09:57.760 align:start position:0%
to it that the language includes exactly
 
01:10:00.390 --> 01:10:00.400 align:start position:0%
what you stated okay thank you thank you
 
01:10:01.990 --> 01:10:02.000 align:start position:0%
very much are there further questions of
 
01:10:04.430 --> 01:10:04.440 align:start position:0%
represent Mooney not seeing it
 
01:10:06.950 --> 01:10:06.960 align:start position:0%
representative Ames your hand up go
 
01:10:06.960 --> 01:10:08.750 align:start position:0%
representative Ames your hand up go
ahead

01:10:08.750 --> 01:10:08.760 align:start position:0%
ahead
 
01:10:12.030 --> 01:10:12.040 align:start position:0%
um and you may have spoken to this and I
 
01:10:15.470 --> 01:10:15.480 align:start position:0%
missed it but uh do you have information
 
01:10:19.430 --> 01:10:19.440 align:start position:0%
on uh projects that have been started
 
01:10:22.870 --> 01:10:22.880 align:start position:0%
down the the application uh
 
01:10:26.229 --> 01:10:26.239 align:start position:0%
roadway uh since the adoption of the law
 
01:10:27.950 --> 01:10:27.960 align:start position:0%
that you sponsored last
 
01:10:31.669 --> 01:10:31.679 align:start position:0%
year so just to clarify do you mean have
 
01:10:34.030 --> 01:10:34.040 align:start position:0%
any of the charter schools in New
 
01:10:35.990 --> 01:10:36.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that own their buildings
 
01:10:38.110 --> 01:10:38.120 align:start position:0%
applied for building Aid since the
 
01:10:40.550 --> 01:10:40.560 align:start position:0%
adoption of this bill law well I'm
 
01:10:42.229 --> 01:10:42.239 align:start position:0%
really looking at a little bit beyond
 
01:10:45.310 --> 01:10:45.320 align:start position:0%
that yes that part of it but as well
 
01:10:47.070 --> 01:10:47.080 align:start position:0%
okay are there others that you know of
 
01:10:51.070 --> 01:10:51.080 align:start position:0%
that are uh that are coming um to
 
01:10:53.390 --> 01:10:53.400 align:start position:0%
fruition as applications my answer would
 
01:10:54.990 --> 01:10:55.000 align:start position:0%
be no I don't know the information on
 
01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:57.510 align:start position:0%
be no I don't know the information on
that

01:10:57.510 --> 01:10:57.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:00.270 --> 01:11:00.280 align:start position:0%
further questions represent McGuire
 
01:11:02.950 --> 01:11:02.960 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um representative
 
01:11:07.510 --> 01:11:07.520 align:start position:0%
would you believe that RSA 194b colon 16
 
01:11:11.470 --> 01:11:11.480 align:start position:0%
provides that when a charter school uh
 
01:11:16.310 --> 01:11:16.320 align:start position:0%
dissolves um its assets are given to the
 
01:11:19.390 --> 01:11:19.400 align:start position:0%
local school district and the local
 
01:11:22.669 --> 01:11:22.679 align:start position:0%
school district does not get any of its
 
01:11:22.679 --> 01:11:25.750 align:start position:0%
school district does not get any of its
obligations

01:11:25.750 --> 01:11:25.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:27.310 --> 01:11:27.320 align:start position:0%
if you are looking at the law I believe
 
01:11:29.950 --> 01:11:29.960 align:start position:0%
that thank that's what we put in the law
 
01:11:32.350 --> 01:11:32.360 align:start position:0%
just recently
 
01:11:35.590 --> 01:11:35.600 align:start position:0%
so do you have a question of the on that
 
01:11:37.830 --> 01:11:37.840 align:start position:0%
yeah absolutely we're not in executive
 
01:11:40.070 --> 01:11:40.080 align:start position:0%
session we're not having a great discuss
 
01:11:42.110 --> 01:11:42.120 align:start position:0%
thank you but I mean that that's a
 
01:11:43.350 --> 01:11:43.360 align:start position:0%
that's a very good point that
 
01:11:46.430 --> 01:11:46.440 align:start position:0%
representative Maguire brings up but um
 
01:11:51.510 --> 01:11:51.520 align:start position:0%
are you aware of any um of the 10 or so
 
01:11:54.550 --> 01:11:54.560 align:start position:0%
uh Charter dissolutions that had any
 
01:11:58.070 --> 01:11:58.080 align:start position:0%
remaining assets that um uh and and were
 
01:12:01.950 --> 01:12:01.960 align:start position:0%
those assets disposed per that um that
 
01:12:04.030 --> 01:12:04.040 align:start position:0%
that uh provision in state law to the
 
01:12:06.430 --> 01:12:06.440 align:start position:0%
local school district the answer is no
 
01:12:08.470 --> 01:12:08.480 align:start position:0%
because I'm just not that familiar with
 
01:12:10.350 --> 01:12:10.360 align:start position:0%
the the closings that have occurred
 
01:12:12.629 --> 01:12:12.639 align:start position:0%
since the '90s in the state on the
 
01:12:14.070 --> 01:12:14.080 align:start position:0%
public charter schools and how their
 
01:12:16.669 --> 01:12:16.679 align:start position:0%
assets were distributed thank you thank
 
01:12:18.910 --> 01:12:18.920 align:start position:0%
you very much any further questions
 
01:12:20.229 --> 01:12:20.239 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you Mr
 
01:12:33.189 --> 01:12:33.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:33.199 --> 01:12:37.149 align:start position:0%
 
good

01:12:37.149 --> 01:12:37.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:40.270 --> 01:12:40.280 align:start position:0%
morning can you turn your mics on yeah
 
01:12:43.390 --> 01:12:43.400 align:start position:0%
thanks hello uh I'm Jody Adams I'm the
 
01:12:44.750 --> 01:12:44.760 align:start position:0%
executive director at the New Hampshire
 
01:12:47.310 --> 01:12:47.320 align:start position:0%
Alliance for public charter
 
01:12:50.149 --> 01:12:50.159 align:start position:0%
schools um I just wanted to say uh first
 
01:12:52.310 --> 01:12:52.320 align:start position:0%
and foremost um charter schools are
 
01:12:54.709 --> 01:12:54.719 align:start position:0%
public schools and we want to be
 
01:12:54.719 --> 01:12:55.830 align:start position:0%
public schools and we want to be
included

01:12:55.830 --> 01:12:55.840 align:start position:0%
included
 
01:12:57.669 --> 01:12:57.679 align:start position:0%
with traditional Public
 
01:13:02.390 --> 01:13:02.400 align:start position:0%
Schools um so as representative Moody
 
01:13:05.870 --> 01:13:05.880 align:start position:0%
was Mooney was saying um this was only
 
01:13:08.030 --> 01:13:08.040 align:start position:0%
added just fairly recently so none of
 
01:13:10.430 --> 01:13:10.440 align:start position:0%
the charter schools have really had the
 
01:13:11.990 --> 01:13:12.000 align:start position:0%
opportunity to even
 
01:13:14.390 --> 01:13:14.400 align:start position:0%
apply um we understand there really
 
01:13:17.629 --> 01:13:17.639 align:start position:0%
isn't a lot of funds in in uh are
 
01:13:20.229 --> 01:13:20.239 align:start position:0%
actually available right now this is
 
01:13:22.270 --> 01:13:22.280 align:start position:0%
more about being included now to even be
 
01:13:25.149 --> 01:13:25.159 align:start position:0%
able to apply there could be more funds
 
01:13:27.910 --> 01:13:27.920 align:start position:0%
down the line in the future so we
 
01:13:30.390 --> 01:13:30.400 align:start position:0%
understand that there's not a lot of
 
01:13:32.310 --> 01:13:32.320 align:start position:0%
funds to go around
 
01:13:35.030 --> 01:13:35.040 align:start position:0%
so to his point you know we are we
 
01:13:36.390 --> 01:13:36.400 align:start position:0%
understand we're competing for a small
 
01:13:38.910 --> 01:13:38.920 align:start position:0%
amount of money and we may not get it
 
01:13:41.510 --> 01:13:41.520 align:start position:0%
and and that makes sense um but securing
 
01:13:42.950 --> 01:13:42.960 align:start position:0%
facilities is a big challenge for
 
01:13:45.229 --> 01:13:45.239 align:start position:0%
charter schools and we would still like
 
01:13:47.709 --> 01:13:47.719 align:start position:0%
to be able to be included with other
 
01:13:51.110 --> 01:13:51.120 align:start position:0%
Public Schools um and have that ability
 
01:13:55.910 --> 01:13:55.920 align:start position:0%
down the down the road um so
 
01:13:59.030 --> 01:13:59.040 align:start position:0%
so we don't have the ability to have
 
01:14:03.950 --> 01:14:03.960 align:start position:0%
local taxes uh for facilities we pay uh
 
01:14:06.629 --> 01:14:06.639 align:start position:0%
Market rates for those facilities and so
 
01:14:09.510 --> 01:14:09.520 align:start position:0%
it is very expensive um to
 
01:14:12.310 --> 01:14:12.320 align:start position:0%
representative Moody's Point um most of
 
01:14:14.270 --> 01:14:14.280 align:start position:0%
our schools don't own their facilities
 
01:14:17.590 --> 01:14:17.600 align:start position:0%
we lease so this really is a matter of a
 
01:14:19.830 --> 01:14:19.840 align:start position:0%
small amount of our schools who are have
 
01:14:23.830 --> 01:14:23.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:26.390 --> 01:14:26.400 align:start position:0%
apply thank thank you very much I think
 
01:14:27.870 --> 01:14:27.880 align:start position:0%
everybody else has pretty much made most
 
01:14:30.910 --> 01:14:30.920 align:start position:0%
of my points already are there any
 
01:14:34.709 --> 01:14:34.719 align:start position:0%
questions of the alliance represent
 
01:14:37.229 --> 01:14:37.239 align:start position:0%
luno uh thank you very much um Miss
 
01:14:39.229 --> 01:14:39.239 align:start position:0%
Adams um you started off by saying
 
01:14:41.110 --> 01:14:41.120 align:start position:0%
charter schools are public schools and I
 
01:14:44.870 --> 01:14:44.880 align:start position:0%
just wanted to to uh to to check on that
 
01:14:47.070 --> 01:14:47.080 align:start position:0%
a little bit so are you saying that are
 
01:14:49.669 --> 01:14:49.679 align:start position:0%
do Charter Schools I mean are Charter
 
01:14:53.149 --> 01:14:53.159 align:start position:0%
Schools political subdivisions like like
 
01:14:55.390 --> 01:14:55.400 align:start position:0%
our public schools are and are they run
 
01:14:58.510 --> 01:14:58.520 align:start position:0%
by publicly elected um um um school
 
01:15:01.870 --> 01:15:01.880 align:start position:0%
board members not publicly elected but
 
01:15:03.870 --> 01:15:03.880 align:start position:0%
we are considered public schools are
 
01:15:06.590 --> 01:15:06.600 align:start position:0%
public charter schools okay and then and
 
01:15:09.830 --> 01:15:09.840 align:start position:0%
and as far as as far as how public how
 
01:15:12.430 --> 01:15:12.440 align:start position:0%
your Charter Schools operate are are
 
01:15:17.110 --> 01:15:17.120 align:start position:0%

questions are we going to have
 
01:15:30.470 --> 01:15:30.480 align:start position:0%
represent that was it was really getting
 
01:15:33.590 --> 01:15:33.600 align:start position:0%
at the term public we are financially
 
01:15:36.870 --> 01:15:36.880 align:start position:0%
and academically held accountable as
 
01:15:41.110 --> 01:15:41.120 align:start position:0%

in executive session we did this last
 
01:16:01.590 --> 01:16:01.600 align:start position:0%
year um as every public school student
 
01:16:03.470 --> 01:16:03.480 align:start position:0%
deserves they receive money not from
 
01:16:05.070 --> 01:16:05.080 align:start position:0%

the executive session we also be getting
 
01:16:27.629 --> 01:16:27.639 align:start position:0%
into it during the work sessions that
 
01:16:29.750 --> 01:16:29.760 align:start position:0%
you talked about we would be having for
 
01:16:31.470 --> 01:16:31.480 align:start position:0%
these groups of bills during the work
 
01:16:33.149 --> 01:16:33.159 align:start position:0%
sessions any information going to
 
01:16:35.310 --> 01:16:35.320 align:start position:0%
contribute to our getting to the end of
 
01:16:39.110 --> 01:16:39.120 align:start position:0%
where we have to get we will bring in um
 
01:16:41.390 --> 01:16:41.400 align:start position:0%
but this discussion is rolling down the
 
01:16:42.830 --> 01:16:42.840 align:start position:0%
road we even had a separate committee
 
01:16:44.910 --> 01:16:44.920 align:start position:0%
looking at this last year and looking at
 
01:16:46.950 --> 01:16:46.960 align:start position:0%
records of charter school when we do
 
01:16:48.350 --> 01:16:48.360 align:start position:0%
have dissolution what happens those
 
01:16:49.990 --> 01:16:50.000 align:start position:0%
records who's in charge the public
 
01:16:53.510 --> 01:16:53.520 align:start position:0%
school uh so the of the of the district
 
01:16:55.669 --> 01:16:55.679 align:start position:0%
so there's a lot to this a very in-depth
 
01:16:59.590 --> 01:16:59.600 align:start position:0%
subject um as building eight is uh
 
01:17:01.950 --> 01:17:01.960 align:start position:0%
totally so we will get into this these
 
01:17:03.270 --> 01:17:03.280 align:start position:0%
are the Bills which are just going to
 
01:17:05.430 --> 01:17:05.440 align:start position:0%
get us into where we have to
 
01:17:09.669 --> 01:17:09.679 align:start position:0%
go further questions of the alliance not
 
01:17:12.350 --> 01:17:12.360 align:start position:0%
seeing thank you very much thank you and
 
01:17:13.950 --> 01:17:13.960 align:start position:0%
with that I'm going to close this
 
01:17:18.350 --> 01:17:18.360 align:start position:0%
hearing I have no other pink cards up
 
01:17:20.830 --> 01:17:20.840 align:start position:0%
here and we're going to get ready to go
 
01:17:20.840 --> 01:17:23.229 align:start position:0%
here and we're going to get ready to go
into

01:17:23.229 --> 01:17:23.239 align:start position:0%
into
 
01:17:25.950 --> 01:17:25.960 align:start position:0%
494 which is a a bill that's been
 
01:17:32.229 --> 01:17:32.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:32.239 --> 01:17:36.470 align:start position:0%
 
communities

01:17:36.470 --> 01:17:36.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:39.629 --> 01:17:39.639 align:start position:0%
and okay yeah okay well you're going to
 
01:17:40.990 --> 01:17:41.000 align:start position:0%
be running this meeting because I got to
 
01:17:48.590 --> 01:17:48.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:48.600 --> 01:17:51.830 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

01:17:51.830 --> 01:17:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:53.990 --> 01:17:54.000 align:start position:0%
me those are the ones which has been
 
01:17:56.990 --> 01:17:57.000 align:start position:0%
handed in I haven't F my not I
 
01:17:59.790 --> 01:17:59.800 align:start position:0%
will you're going to introduce it yes I
 
01:18:21.470 --> 01:18:21.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:23.950 --> 01:18:23.960 align:start position:0%
introduce okay I'm going to open the
 
01:18:26.910 --> 01:18:26.920 align:start position:0%
hearing on a HB 494 and recognize
 
01:18:30.550 --> 01:18:30.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:32.669 --> 01:18:32.679 align:start position:0%
sponsor well thank you very much to the
 
01:18:34.390 --> 01:18:34.400 align:start position:0%
committee for the record my name is Rick
 
01:18:36.629 --> 01:18:36.639 align:start position:0%
lad I come from grafted five that's haal
 
01:18:40.750 --> 01:18:40.760 align:start position:0%
Benton Pont Warren Landa up on the
 
01:18:43.950 --> 01:18:43.960 align:start position:0%
Connecticut River um I'm here today to
 
01:18:48.350 --> 01:18:48.360 align:start position:0%
introduce 494 this is a program uh that
 
01:18:51.709 --> 01:18:51.719 align:start position:0%
we uh have been funding here for several
 
01:18:53.510 --> 01:18:53.520 align:start position:0%
years initially through a Federal grant
 
01:18:55.709 --> 01:18:55.719 align:start position:0%
that the community college has received
 
01:18:57.629 --> 01:18:57.639 align:start position:0%
and subsequently last year when we
 
01:18:58.950 --> 01:18:58.960 align:start position:0%
placed uh
 
01:19:02.830 --> 01:19:02.840 align:start position:0%
$250,000 into the budget to continue
 
01:19:04.350 --> 01:19:04.360 align:start position:0%
with the math learning community so I
 
01:19:07.270 --> 01:19:07.280 align:start position:0%
want to describe what this program is to
 
01:19:10.229 --> 01:19:10.239 align:start position:0%
everybody very briefly here uh for you I
 
01:19:12.350 --> 01:19:12.360 align:start position:0%
think I there should be a sheet coming
 
01:19:15.229 --> 01:19:15.239 align:start position:0%
around that has my testimony on it and
 
01:19:16.709 --> 01:19:16.719 align:start position:0%
I'm just going to jump down through the
 
01:19:20.790 --> 01:19:20.800 align:start position:0%
three categories there um how do we
 
01:19:22.590 --> 01:19:22.600 align:start position:0%
describe and how what is this program
 
01:19:24.830 --> 01:19:24.840 align:start position:0%
this program is a program where we know
 
01:19:28.229 --> 01:19:28.239 align:start position:0%
that we have within our K through2
 
01:19:31.990 --> 01:19:32.000 align:start position:0%
system that we've had our mathematics
 
01:19:34.430 --> 01:19:34.440 align:start position:0%
achievement kind of level if not even
 
01:19:36.830 --> 01:19:36.840 align:start position:0%
going down when I came on board here we
 
01:19:41.430 --> 01:19:41.440 align:start position:0%
had roughly around 40% of our students
 
01:19:43.709 --> 01:19:43.719 align:start position:0%
uh proficient in mathematics we're right
 
01:19:46.390 --> 01:19:46.400 align:start position:0%
in the same neighborhood today we have a
 
01:19:49.950 --> 01:19:49.960 align:start position:0%
need to address what is going on with
 
01:19:52.990 --> 01:19:53.000 align:start position:0%
some of the students that need uh
 
01:19:55.310 --> 01:19:55.320 align:start position:0%
support initially this program was put
 
01:19:58.229 --> 01:19:58.239 align:start position:0%
into place in the high schools through a
 
01:19:59.870 --> 01:19:59.880 align:start position:0%
grant money from from the federal
 
01:20:01.149 --> 01:20:01.159 align:start position:0%
government which the Community College
 
01:20:01.159 --> 01:20:02.430 align:start position:0%
government which the Community College
had

01:20:02.430 --> 01:20:02.440 align:start position:0%
had
 
01:20:05.189 --> 01:20:05.199 align:start position:0%
received and the minister it through the
 
01:20:07.470 --> 01:20:07.480 align:start position:0%
in conjunction with the Department of
 
01:20:09.590 --> 01:20:09.600 align:start position:0%
Education what we did is at the end of
 
01:20:11.470 --> 01:20:11.480 align:start position:0%
the ninth grade those students which
 
01:20:13.590 --> 01:20:13.600 align:start position:0%
were appearing to have a hard time in
 
01:20:17.149 --> 01:20:17.159 align:start position:0%
mathematics they were given a a an
 
01:20:19.430 --> 01:20:19.440 align:start position:0%
assessment which is was used at that
 
01:20:22.110 --> 01:20:22.120 align:start position:0%
time at the community college the uh
 
01:20:24.750 --> 01:20:24.760 align:start position:0%
accuplacer Next Generation accuplacer I
 
01:20:27.149 --> 01:20:27.159 align:start position:0%
think the name was it's no longer used
 
01:20:29.790 --> 01:20:29.800 align:start position:0%
that would uh the kids would take that
 
01:20:32.310 --> 01:20:32.320 align:start position:0%
and see who is really prepared to go
 
01:20:35.110 --> 01:20:35.120 align:start position:0%
into algebra algebra 2 we know that
 
01:20:36.750 --> 01:20:36.760 align:start position:0%
there's a number of students coming out
 
01:20:38.270 --> 01:20:38.280 align:start position:0%
of the elementary schools and the middle
 
01:20:40.990 --> 01:20:41.000 align:start position:0%
schools which just don't have real
 
01:20:43.350 --> 01:20:43.360 align:start position:0%
confidence in mathematics for one reason
 
01:20:46.910 --> 01:20:46.920 align:start position:0%
or another they're they're not really
 
01:20:49.310 --> 01:20:49.320 align:start position:0%
able to grasp from the conceptual
 
01:20:51.990 --> 01:20:52.000 align:start position:0%
understandings that math
 
01:20:55.750 --> 01:20:55.760 align:start position:0%
requires so what was done there several
 
01:20:57.790 --> 01:20:57.800 align:start position:0%
foundational math class was introduced
 
01:21:00.390 --> 01:21:00.400 align:start position:0%
in the high school along with another
 
01:21:03.590 --> 01:21:03.600 align:start position:0%
one in quantitative math where it was
 
01:21:06.149 --> 01:21:06.159 align:start position:0%
presented so the learning style of the
 
01:21:09.030 --> 01:21:09.040 align:start position:0%
student the teaching style matched that
 
01:21:10.830 --> 01:21:10.840 align:start position:0%
of the
 
01:21:14.229 --> 01:21:14.239 align:start position:0%
learner not taught in that conventional
 
01:21:16.229 --> 01:21:16.239 align:start position:0%
traditional manner it might have been
 
01:21:18.550 --> 01:21:18.560 align:start position:0%
more Hands-On it may have been more you
 
01:21:22.390 --> 01:21:22.400 align:start position:0%
know uh relating these skills to actual
 
01:21:26.510 --> 01:21:26.520 align:start position:0%
Pathways and careers so kids became able
 
01:21:28.070 --> 01:21:28.080 align:start position:0%
they they could see some of the rational
 
01:21:30.470 --> 01:21:30.480 align:start position:0%
why to do that since that time the
 
01:21:33.390 --> 01:21:33.400 align:start position:0%
program has had changed we had at that
 
01:21:35.470 --> 01:21:35.480 align:start position:0%
time about 38 high schools participating
 
01:21:36.950 --> 01:21:36.960 align:start position:0%
at throughout the state and we were
 
01:21:39.629 --> 01:21:39.639 align:start position:0%
seeing remarkable gains we were seeing
 
01:21:42.270 --> 01:21:42.280 align:start position:0%
that we were not having that 60 per rate
 
01:21:43.750 --> 01:21:43.760 align:start position:0%
when kids went into the community
 
01:21:46.270 --> 01:21:46.280 align:start position:0%
college system that required remedial
 
01:21:49.189 --> 01:21:49.199 align:start position:0%
mathematics we were a to cut that down
 
01:21:52.229 --> 01:21:52.239 align:start position:0%
the Federal grant money stopped and and
 
01:21:55.470 --> 01:21:55.480 align:start position:0%
also our Appropriations reduced too to
 
01:21:57.990 --> 01:21:58.000 align:start position:0%
the point where there were none and that
 
01:22:00.510 --> 01:22:00.520 align:start position:0%
program fell apart because the Community
 
01:22:02.550 --> 01:22:02.560 align:start position:0%
College was also offering professional
 
01:22:04.430 --> 01:22:04.440 align:start position:0%
training and training of the instructors
 
01:22:06.669 --> 01:22:06.679 align:start position:0%
and how to teach the math learning
 
01:22:09.750 --> 01:22:09.760 align:start position:0%
communities program last year the house
 
01:22:11.390 --> 01:22:11.400 align:start position:0%
and the Senate and the governor had the
 
01:22:14.390 --> 01:22:14.400 align:start position:0%
wisdom to sign it a law that the
 
01:22:18.189 --> 01:22:18.199 align:start position:0%
$250,000 to reboot this program and it
 
01:22:20.669 --> 01:22:20.679 align:start position:0%
has been done so and now we had changed
 
01:22:22.669 --> 01:22:22.679 align:start position:0%
directorship over there and the
 
01:22:24.590 --> 01:22:24.600 align:start position:0%
directorship prior to was an excellent
 
01:22:26.350 --> 01:22:26.360 align:start position:0%
directorship the community college has
 
01:22:28.030 --> 01:22:28.040 align:start position:0%
always been very supportive of this
 
01:22:30.910 --> 01:22:30.920 align:start position:0%
program and as the Math teachers
 
01:22:33.830 --> 01:22:33.840 align:start position:0%
throughout the state are so the program
 
01:22:36.070 --> 01:22:36.080 align:start position:0%
is now administered clearly and solely
 
01:22:37.750 --> 01:22:37.760 align:start position:0%
through the community college system of
 
01:22:40.590 --> 01:22:40.600 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire in partnership with post
 
01:22:42.070 --> 01:22:42.080 align:start position:0%
secondary high
 
01:22:44.910 --> 01:22:44.920 align:start position:0%
schools it accurately defines the the
 
01:22:47.470 --> 01:22:47.480 align:start position:0%
program is used for struggling students
 
01:22:49.070 --> 01:22:49.080 align:start position:0%
who have not been able to master the
 
01:22:51.830 --> 01:22:51.840 align:start position:0%
skills and it it it stresses to do the
 
01:22:53.470 --> 01:22:53.480 align:start position:0%
same thing it was originally designed to
 
01:22:53.480 --> 01:22:55.830 align:start position:0%
same thing it was originally designed to
do

01:22:55.830 --> 01:22:55.840 align:start position:0%
do
 
01:22:58.229 --> 01:22:58.239 align:start position:0%
the program now is being redefined in
 
01:23:01.070 --> 01:23:01.080 align:start position:0%
statute it's it's in statute uh I
 
01:23:01.080 --> 01:23:03.310 align:start position:0%
statute it's it's in statute uh I
believe

01:23:03.310 --> 01:23:03.320 align:start position:0%
believe
 
01:23:08.390 --> 01:23:08.400 align:start position:0%
193 I I believe um and in that in that
 
01:23:11.189 --> 01:23:11.199 align:start position:0%
statute we have written up the structure
 
01:23:12.950 --> 01:23:12.960 align:start position:0%
and the sequence of courses that are
 
01:23:14.510 --> 01:23:14.520 align:start position:0%
presented the program shall consist of
 
01:23:17.270 --> 01:23:17.280 align:start position:0%
one or more High School level courses if
 
01:23:19.070 --> 01:23:19.080 align:start position:0%
a student goes through these courses and
 
01:23:21.189 --> 01:23:21.199 align:start position:0%
is able to master these and come out
 
01:23:23.390 --> 01:23:23.400 align:start position:0%
with an understanding Algebra 2 which
 
01:23:25.310 --> 01:23:25.320 align:start position:0%
many of them are doing through this
 
01:23:28.390 --> 01:23:28.400 align:start position:0%
non-traditional way of teaching they are
 
01:23:30.590 --> 01:23:30.600 align:start position:0%
able to take concurrent the the last
 
01:23:33.709 --> 01:23:33.719 align:start position:0%
year at concurrent and dual and
 
01:23:36.189 --> 01:23:36.199 align:start position:0%
concurrent uh I'm going to say dual
 
01:23:38.990 --> 01:23:39.000 align:start position:0%
enrollment program and get college
 
01:23:43.390 --> 01:23:43.400 align:start position:0%
credit for that uh so the students
 
01:23:45.750 --> 01:23:45.760 align:start position:0%
mastering Algebra 2 concept shall be
 
01:23:47.590 --> 01:23:47.600 align:start position:0%
considered for dual enrollment college
 
01:23:50.310 --> 01:23:50.320 align:start position:0%
level mathematics dual enrollment means
 
01:23:53.669 --> 01:23:53.679 align:start position:0%
it's taught at the college by a person
 
01:23:55.550 --> 01:23:55.560 align:start position:0%
with the same standards that it is for
 
01:23:57.189 --> 01:23:57.199 align:start position:0%
every other student that's been approved
 
01:23:58.790 --> 01:23:58.800 align:start position:0%
by the crediting Association at the
 
01:24:00.910 --> 01:24:00.920 align:start position:0%
Collegiate level concurrent enrollment
 
01:24:02.430 --> 01:24:02.440 align:start position:0%
is where it's done in the high school by
 
01:24:04.149 --> 01:24:04.159 align:start position:0%
high school teacher but with the same
 
01:24:07.390 --> 01:24:07.400 align:start position:0%
standards same materials as used in
 
01:24:11.229 --> 01:24:11.239 align:start position:0%
college the the community college system
 
01:24:13.950 --> 01:24:13.960 align:start position:0%
is providing professional training for
 
01:24:16.470 --> 01:24:16.480 align:start position:0%
the the teachers which are teaching this
 
01:24:20.510 --> 01:24:20.520 align:start position:0%
program and the new statutory language
 
01:24:21.750 --> 01:24:21.760 align:start position:0%
which has been placed here you can see
 
01:24:24.149 --> 01:24:24.159 align:start position:0%
in the bottom portion of the class of
 
01:24:26.590 --> 01:24:26.600 align:start position:0%

October 1 now a report and that report
 
01:24:37.510 --> 01:24:37.520 align:start position:0%
to us will reflect the number of
 
01:24:39.629 --> 01:24:39.639 align:start position:0%

provided to the to the Department and to
 
01:24:57.510 --> 01:24:57.520 align:start position:0%
this education committee and other
 
01:24:58.990 --> 01:24:59.000 align:start position:0%
information as determined by the
 
01:25:00.910 --> 01:25:00.920 align:start position:0%
Community College the first year we're
 
01:25:04.070 --> 01:25:04.080 align:start position:0%
talking about the FY uh 26 there we are
 
01:25:06.310 --> 01:25:06.320 align:start position:0%
allocating $200,000 for this program to
 
01:25:09.470 --> 01:25:09.480 align:start position:0%
continue and in the SEC year second year
 
01:25:09.480 --> 01:25:11.189 align:start position:0%
continue and in the SEC year second year
um

01:25:11.189 --> 01:25:11.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:25:14.870 --> 01:25:14.880 align:start position:0%
$250,000 I attended a workshop or a
 
01:25:17.629 --> 01:25:17.639 align:start position:0%
training session on Friday August 16th
 
01:25:17.639 --> 01:25:18.390 align:start position:0%
training session on Friday August 16th
in

01:25:18.390 --> 01:25:18.400 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:25:21.109 --> 01:25:21.119 align:start position:0%
nhti where we pulled in instructors
 
01:25:23.750 --> 01:25:23.760 align:start position:0%
throughout this state in mathematics
 
01:25:27.030 --> 01:25:27.040 align:start position:0%
I've never been in a in a program like
 
01:25:29.030 --> 01:25:29.040 align:start position:0%
this before where I've seen so much
 
01:25:31.350 --> 01:25:31.360 align:start position:0%
excitement for where we need to go with
 
01:25:32.950 --> 01:25:32.960 align:start position:0%
the teaching of mathematics it was well
 
01:25:34.550 --> 01:25:34.560 align:start position:0%
done and I congratulate the community
 
01:25:36.830 --> 01:25:36.840 align:start position:0%
college system for really helping us out
 
01:25:39.189 --> 01:25:39.199 align:start position:0%
in this endeavor it's come out though
 
01:25:41.189 --> 01:25:41.199 align:start position:0%
that this program and other programs we
 
01:25:42.790 --> 01:25:42.800 align:start position:0%
really need to start dipping down lower
 
01:25:45.229 --> 01:25:45.239 align:start position:0%
than just in the high school the fear of
 
01:25:47.629 --> 01:25:47.639 align:start position:0%
mathematics starts well down in the
 
01:25:50.109 --> 01:25:50.119 align:start position:0%
Elementary grades and these teachers
 
01:25:51.709 --> 01:25:51.719 align:start position:0%
that are working with the community
 
01:25:53.629 --> 01:25:53.639 align:start position:0%
college system now are being trained on
 
01:25:56.310 --> 01:25:56.320 align:start position:0%
working other folks uh in their school
 
01:25:58.430 --> 01:25:58.440 align:start position:0%
system on the back side of that paper
 
01:25:59.270 --> 01:25:59.280 align:start position:0%
you can
 
01:26:01.830 --> 01:26:01.840 align:start position:0%
see that because we are rebooting this
 
01:26:03.510 --> 01:26:03.520 align:start position:0%
program and that will be explained in
 
01:26:06.550 --> 01:26:06.560 align:start position:0%
detail by folks behind me that there are
 
01:26:09.390 --> 01:26:09.400 align:start position:0%
12 confirmed Partners already expressing
 
01:26:12.629 --> 01:26:12.639 align:start position:0%
desire to be involved with this in FY 26
 
01:26:16.030 --> 01:26:16.040 align:start position:0%
in Lakes Manchester Central Manchester
 
01:26:19.830 --> 01:26:19.840 align:start position:0%

01:26:29.109 --> 01:26:29.119 align:start position:0%
Woodsville havil these schools have all
 
01:26:31.310 --> 01:26:31.320 align:start position:0%
had identified they have staffed they
 
01:26:34.430 --> 01:26:34.440 align:start position:0%
trained and willing and to really start
 
01:26:36.550 --> 01:26:36.560 align:start position:0%
this program out I think this is
 
01:26:38.629 --> 01:26:38.639 align:start position:0%
something that we need to continue this
 
01:26:40.910 --> 01:26:40.920 align:start position:0%
is an area of our curriculum and
 
01:26:43.510 --> 01:26:43.520 align:start position:0%
achievement of our students which needs
 
01:26:46.830 --> 01:26:46.840 align:start position:0%
our address mathematics is our weak
 
01:26:50.350 --> 01:26:50.360 align:start position:0%
subject area in this state and it's not
 
01:26:53.709 --> 01:26:53.719 align:start position:0%
just a result of the pandemic as you may
 
01:26:55.350 --> 01:26:55.360 align:start position:0%
recall and representative fellows may
 
01:26:58.030 --> 01:26:58.040 align:start position:0%
recall working with Paul Leathers Paul
 
01:27:01.030 --> 01:27:01.040 align:start position:0%
chaired a task force on math uh
 
01:27:04.790 --> 01:27:04.800 align:start position:0%
instruction in the state 12 years ago
 
01:27:07.430 --> 01:27:07.440 align:start position:0%
and they identified math is needing a
 
01:27:10.149 --> 01:27:10.159 align:start position:0%
lot of help it continues to need that
 
01:27:12.790 --> 01:27:12.800 align:start position:0%
help I'm glad to see that the community
 
01:27:14.669 --> 01:27:14.679 align:start position:0%
college system is recognizing that the
 
01:27:16.750 --> 01:27:16.760 align:start position:0%
old conventional method that we've been
 
01:27:19.390 --> 01:27:19.400 align:start position:0%
working has been netting results and
 
01:27:21.950 --> 01:27:21.960 align:start position:0%
what they're doing here is something new
 
01:27:25.149 --> 01:27:25.159 align:start position:0%
and I really really feel that this is
 
01:27:26.629 --> 01:27:26.639 align:start position:0%
one of the ways which we're going to
 
01:27:28.870 --> 01:27:28.880 align:start position:0%
really upgrade our math results in our
 
01:27:30.470 --> 01:27:30.480 align:start position:0%
school district so with that I'm going
 
01:27:31.870 --> 01:27:31.880 align:start position:0%
to stop and let the community college
 
01:27:34.030 --> 01:27:34.040 align:start position:0%
system take over they're the ones who
 
01:27:36.390 --> 01:27:36.400 align:start position:0%
have the specifics on this program the
 
01:27:38.709 --> 01:27:38.719 align:start position:0%
good thing is that the money goes to the
 
01:27:40.229 --> 01:27:40.239 align:start position:0%
community college system and it's
 
01:27:41.470 --> 01:27:41.480 align:start position:0%
administered through the community
 
01:27:46.070 --> 01:27:46.080 align:start position:0%
college system and um it
 
01:27:49.310 --> 01:27:49.320 align:start position:0%
works I'll take any questions Mr
 
01:27:53.189 --> 01:27:53.199 align:start position:0%
chair yes representative Maguire thank
 
01:27:56.390 --> 01:27:56.400 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman thank you representative
 
01:27:59.310 --> 01:27:59.320 align:start position:0%
um so this is a program that's already
 
01:28:02.709 --> 01:28:02.719 align:start position:0%
in law that's being Rewritten could we
 
01:28:05.550 --> 01:28:05.560 align:start position:0%
ask our committee researcher to do a
 
01:28:08.709 --> 01:28:08.719 align:start position:0%
side by side and and sort of what what
 
01:28:11.910 --> 01:28:11.920 align:start position:0%
we're doing now versus how the rewrite
 
01:28:15.430 --> 01:28:15.440 align:start position:0%
changes including financial
 
01:28:18.310 --> 01:28:18.320 align:start position:0%
matters the financial matters haven't
 
01:28:20.629 --> 01:28:20.639 align:start position:0%
changed the they the same as we've
 
01:28:21.669 --> 01:28:21.679 align:start position:0%
always had
 
01:28:23.910 --> 01:28:23.920 align:start position:0%
$250,000 although this is lessening in
 
01:28:27.750 --> 01:28:27.760 align:start position:0%
the first year $200,000 then $ 250 the
 
01:28:29.709 --> 01:28:29.719 align:start position:0%
two there's two sections if you look at
 
01:28:33.430 --> 01:28:33.440 align:start position:0%
the statute which this language in this
 
01:28:36.470 --> 01:28:36.480 align:start position:0%
bill is replacing with updates we're
 
01:28:39.109 --> 01:28:39.119 align:start position:0%
taking the accuplacer out we had
 
01:28:42.270 --> 01:28:42.280 align:start position:0%
specific names to test tier one tier two
 
01:28:44.750 --> 01:28:44.760 align:start position:0%
and the names of that what we're doing
 
01:28:46.910 --> 01:28:46.920 align:start position:0%
is we're letting the local assessments
 
01:28:49.229 --> 01:28:49.239 align:start position:0%
now do that assessment it's not going to
 
01:28:51.310 --> 01:28:51.320 align:start position:0%
have to be done through that accuplacer
 
01:28:52.910 --> 01:28:52.920 align:start position:0%
which that was all being provided
 
01:28:55.430 --> 01:28:55.440 align:start position:0%
through Federal Monies and quite frankly
 
01:28:57.390 --> 01:28:57.400 align:start position:0%
it's outdated now and it's not what
 
01:29:00.229 --> 01:29:00.239 align:start position:0%
schools are using so yeah we can have a
 
01:29:01.669 --> 01:29:01.679 align:start position:0%
side by side done there's no problem
 
01:29:03.910 --> 01:29:03.920 align:start position:0%
with that thank you may I have a
 
01:29:07.950 --> 01:29:07.960 align:start position:0%
followup yes thank you Mr chairman um it
 
01:29:09.870 --> 01:29:09.880 align:start position:0%
looks to me like this is spending
 
01:29:11.590 --> 01:29:11.600 align:start position:0%
General funds would it be more
 
01:29:16.030 --> 01:29:16.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:17.830 --> 01:29:17.840 align:start position:0%
funds to
 
01:29:21.510 --> 01:29:21.520 align:start position:0%
me that's one way the other is fine as
 
01:29:23.790 --> 01:29:23.800 align:start position:0%
long as the funds are there what we're
 
01:29:25.790 --> 01:29:25.800 align:start position:0%
doing as school districts are really
 
01:29:27.990 --> 01:29:28.000 align:start position:0%
getting their training from the
 
01:29:29.629 --> 01:29:29.639 align:start position:0%
community college system we're getting
 
01:29:31.149 --> 01:29:31.159 align:start position:0%
instructors from the community college
 
01:29:33.070 --> 01:29:33.080 align:start position:0%
system they're paying for the training
 
01:29:35.590 --> 01:29:35.600 align:start position:0%
for people to come in the summertime to
 
01:29:38.270 --> 01:29:38.280 align:start position:0%
nhti the travel we're paying for the
 
01:29:40.590 --> 01:29:40.600 align:start position:0%
time that they're at the stien all
 
01:29:42.790 --> 01:29:42.800 align:start position:0%
that's coming through this so it's
 
01:29:46.910 --> 01:29:46.920 align:start position:0%
really a savings to school districts um
 
01:29:48.790 --> 01:29:48.800 align:start position:0%
and it's just what we're doing here this
 
01:29:52.109 --> 01:29:52.119 align:start position:0%
is trying to put in place legislation to
 
01:29:54.550 --> 01:29:54.560 align:start position:0%
continue what we have been doing
 
01:29:56.830 --> 01:29:56.840 align:start position:0%
and the funding amount in there is
 
01:29:59.510 --> 01:29:59.520 align:start position:0%
trying to continue to see this reflected
 
01:30:03.030 --> 01:30:03.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:06.510 --> 01:30:06.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:06.520 --> 01:30:08.390 align:start position:0%
 
questions

01:30:08.390 --> 01:30:08.400 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:30:10.830 --> 01:30:10.840 align:start position:0%
yes so
 
01:30:13.990 --> 01:30:14.000 align:start position:0%
uh I could be wrong but so I believe you
 
01:30:16.430 --> 01:30:16.440 align:start position:0%
said that the reporting oh I'm sorry
 
01:30:19.070 --> 01:30:19.080 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question thank
 
01:30:21.109 --> 01:30:21.119 align:start position:0%
you very much I believe you said that
 
01:30:25.310 --> 01:30:25.320 align:start position:0%
the reporting section is new do we have
 
01:30:31.430 --> 01:30:31.440 align:start position:0%
any um data from when how I guess how do
 
01:30:34.310 --> 01:30:34.320 align:start position:0%
we know that I mean I know you said that
 
01:30:37.030 --> 01:30:37.040 align:start position:0%
it's doing great and I'm sure that it is
 
01:30:40.350 --> 01:30:40.360 align:start position:0%
but do we have any data and could if we
 
01:30:42.870 --> 01:30:42.880 align:start position:0%
do can it be maybe shared with us I
 
01:30:45.270 --> 01:30:45.280 align:start position:0%
think that the data can be shared from
 
01:30:47.229 --> 01:30:47.239 align:start position:0%
the by the community college system in
 
01:30:50.790 --> 01:30:50.800 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire we're seeing fewer kids
 
01:30:53.310 --> 01:30:53.320 align:start position:0%
when they get into the Collegiate level
 
01:30:55.830 --> 01:30:55.840 align:start position:0%
having to take that remed in fact we're
 
01:30:57.590 --> 01:30:57.600 align:start position:0%
not giving a remedial education they can
 
01:31:00.310 --> 01:31:00.320 align:start position:0%
explain how that works now um few are
 
01:31:02.189 --> 01:31:02.199 align:start position:0%
there and we're seeing those students
 
01:31:05.950 --> 01:31:05.960 align:start position:0%
coming out with math already under their
 
01:31:07.550 --> 01:31:07.560 align:start position:0%
belt so when they go to the community
 
01:31:09.189 --> 01:31:09.199 align:start position:0%
college system they've already met that
 
01:31:11.669 --> 01:31:11.679 align:start position:0%
credit okay yeah thank you they can
 
01:31:14.109 --> 01:31:14.119 align:start position:0%
provide that info
 
01:31:16.870 --> 01:31:16.880 align:start position:0%
thanks representative
 
01:31:21.229 --> 01:31:21.239 align:start position:0%
Ames thank you and thank you um
 
01:31:24.350 --> 01:31:24.360 align:start position:0%
representative lad uh looks like a great
 
01:31:26.950 --> 01:31:26.960 align:start position:0%
program uh I'm just wondering about
 
01:31:31.070 --> 01:31:31.080 align:start position:0%
reaching out to outline districts and uh
 
01:31:34.350 --> 01:31:34.360 align:start position:0%
I noticed that these 12 are uh outside
 
01:31:38.310 --> 01:31:38.320 align:start position:0%
of my county jure county and um we're
 
01:31:40.229 --> 01:31:40.239 align:start position:0%
all concerned about being sure that
 
01:31:43.390 --> 01:31:43.400 align:start position:0%
every kid in the state has access to
 
01:31:45.629 --> 01:31:45.639 align:start position:0%
good programs like this so can you speak
 
01:31:48.109 --> 01:31:48.119 align:start position:0%
to that yeah I think Community College
 
01:31:49.709 --> 01:31:49.719 align:start position:0%
represent I think the Community College
 
01:31:51.870 --> 01:31:51.880 align:start position:0%
can do that remember we're rebooting
 
01:31:54.470 --> 01:31:54.480 align:start position:0%
here we had 38 schools before
 
01:31:56.590 --> 01:31:56.600 align:start position:0%
now you see the 12 for that but there's
 
01:31:59.310 --> 01:31:59.320 align:start position:0%
more to come that are on the docket they
 
01:32:02.149 --> 01:32:02.159 align:start position:0%
have to gear up make sure that they have
 
01:32:04.430 --> 01:32:04.440 align:start position:0%
the people on board to teach these
 
01:32:06.910 --> 01:32:06.920 align:start position:0%
courses I know that the town I'm in
 
01:32:10.109 --> 01:32:10.119 align:start position:0%
Woodsville havil we just hired a ma
 
01:32:12.950 --> 01:32:12.960 align:start position:0%
teacher which we stole from rivendale
 
01:32:15.550 --> 01:32:15.560 align:start position:0%
and uh able to do this now and do it
 
01:32:19.070 --> 01:32:19.080 align:start position:0%
well and I'm I'm seeing already just by
 
01:32:21.350 --> 01:32:21.360 align:start position:0%
watching what's going on in that school
 
01:32:24.310 --> 01:32:24.320 align:start position:0%
kids are enjoying mathematics where it
 
01:32:27.350 --> 01:32:27.360 align:start position:0%
hadn't happened before so yes it's got
 
01:32:29.510 --> 01:32:29.520 align:start position:0%
to be in other counties as well
 
01:32:33.229 --> 01:32:33.239 align:start position:0%
grafton's pretty far north and uh so I
 
01:32:34.709 --> 01:32:34.719 align:start position:0%
guess they tapped into it because Rick
 
01:32:36.390 --> 01:32:36.400 align:start position:0%
lad was able to inform them that there's
 
01:32:38.910 --> 01:32:38.920 align:start position:0%
a program get involved but I think it
 
01:32:41.109 --> 01:32:41.119 align:start position:0%
was also because of the superintendent
 
01:32:43.030 --> 01:32:43.040 align:start position:0%
there was recognizing this is our
 
01:32:46.149 --> 01:32:46.159 align:start position:0%
weakness and two years ago they rebooted
 
01:32:49.149 --> 01:32:49.159 align:start position:0%
their whole math program and wrote the
 
01:32:51.669 --> 01:32:51.679 align:start position:0%
math standards and over they know we
 
01:32:53.350 --> 01:32:53.360 align:start position:0%
have math standards but wrote their
 
01:32:53.360 --> 01:32:54.350 align:start position:0%
have math standards but wrote their
curriculum

01:32:54.350 --> 01:32:54.360 align:start position:0%
curriculum
 
01:32:57.310 --> 01:32:57.320 align:start position:0%
and bought new materials and that's
 
01:32:59.750 --> 01:32:59.760 align:start position:0%
making a difference so that you had your
 
01:33:02.390 --> 01:33:02.400 align:start position:0%
high school teachers now working as the
 
01:33:04.830 --> 01:33:04.840 align:start position:0%
more like the directors of mathematic
 
01:33:06.350 --> 01:33:06.360 align:start position:0%
working with the Middle School working
 
01:33:07.950 --> 01:33:07.960 align:start position:0%
with the elementary school and getting
 
01:33:09.830 --> 01:33:09.840 align:start position:0%
everybody in the same book and close to
 
01:33:13.030 --> 01:33:13.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:13.040 --> 01:33:14.750 align:start position:0%
 
page

01:33:14.750 --> 01:33:14.760 align:start position:0%
page
 
01:33:17.390 --> 01:33:17.400 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chairman thank you I'm
 
01:33:18.950 --> 01:33:18.960 align:start position:0%
I'm probably the only one in this room
 
01:33:21.149 --> 01:33:21.159 align:start position:0%
that actually took the acup Placer and
 
01:33:23.830 --> 01:33:23.840 align:start position:0%
barely passed uh as president of a
 
01:33:25.830 --> 01:33:25.840 align:start position:0%
Community College but why this is so
 
01:33:28.990 --> 01:33:29.000 align:start position:0%
important I I ask you to agree with me
 
01:33:30.750 --> 01:33:30.760 align:start position:0%
is that students coming to community
 
01:33:33.590 --> 01:33:33.600 align:start position:0%
colleges particularly often lack
 
01:33:36.629 --> 01:33:36.639 align:start position:0%
confidence and and they need to get by
 
01:33:40.310 --> 01:33:40.320 align:start position:0%
this barrier and we saw our students
 
01:33:43.189 --> 01:33:43.199 align:start position:0%
bestm the acup place by a few points it
 
01:33:45.550 --> 01:33:45.560 align:start position:0%
it cost them financial aid it cost them
 
01:33:48.350 --> 01:33:48.360 align:start position:0%
time it cost them choice of major it
 
01:33:50.910 --> 01:33:50.920 align:start position:0%
it's a major hangup so this program and
 
01:33:53.950 --> 01:33:53.960 align:start position:0%
we had similar to it later is extremely
 
01:33:57.109 --> 01:33:57.119 align:start position:0%
important it's EXT and I I'm asking you
 
01:33:59.149 --> 01:33:59.159 align:start position:0%
it's extremely important especially in
 
01:34:01.109 --> 01:34:01.119 align:start position:0%
minority students and new immigrants
 
01:34:04.709 --> 01:34:04.719 align:start position:0%
which I had thousands of um to to get by
 
01:34:06.990 --> 01:34:07.000 align:start position:0%
this barrier and move on into the majors
 
01:34:08.709 --> 01:34:08.719 align:start position:0%
that they needed to get into with the
 
01:34:11.510 --> 01:34:11.520 align:start position:0%
confidence they had the math my question
 
01:34:14.109 --> 01:34:14.119 align:start position:0%
is would you support uh a bill to force
 
01:34:15.629 --> 01:34:15.639 align:start position:0%
anyone elected to the New Hampshire
 
01:34:18.910 --> 01:34:18.920 align:start position:0%
state legislature to pass The
 
01:34:21.590 --> 01:34:21.600 align:start position:0%
accuplacer Well Community College system
 
01:34:23.590 --> 01:34:23.600 align:start position:0%
dumped the accuplacer just for some of
 
01:34:26.750 --> 01:34:26.760 align:start position:0%
the reasons you spoke about and now it's
 
01:34:28.950 --> 01:34:28.960 align:start position:0%
up to the recommendation of the teacher
 
01:34:31.350 --> 01:34:31.360 align:start position:0%
the parent and all saying my youngster
 
01:34:33.430 --> 01:34:33.440 align:start position:0%
this youngster needs to go have this
 
01:34:35.790 --> 01:34:35.800 align:start position:0%
alternate rout their learning style does
 
01:34:37.750 --> 01:34:37.760 align:start position:0%
not match up the way math is being
 
01:34:39.750 --> 01:34:39.760 align:start position:0%
taught presently they need this
 
01:34:42.310 --> 01:34:42.320 align:start position:0%
alternative route and they need to
 
01:34:43.990 --> 01:34:44.000 align:start position:0%
better understand the concepts and how
 
01:34:46.510 --> 01:34:46.520 align:start position:0%
math works I was one like that when I
 
01:34:48.189 --> 01:34:48.199 align:start position:0%
was in grade school I was dreadfully
 
01:34:50.629 --> 01:34:50.639 align:start position:0%
afraid of mathematics I loved history I
 
01:34:52.750 --> 01:34:52.760 align:start position:0%
loved writing I loved all that but when
 
01:34:55.310 --> 01:34:55.320 align:start position:0%
it came to math it was my forte it
 
01:34:57.550 --> 01:34:57.560 align:start position:0%
wasn't until I hit the right teacher in
 
01:35:00.510 --> 01:35:00.520 align:start position:0%
high school who taught geometry and I
 
01:35:02.470 --> 01:35:02.480 align:start position:0%
could see it I could live it and I knew
 
01:35:05.550 --> 01:35:05.560 align:start position:0%
why I was learning it and so I think
 
01:35:07.510 --> 01:35:07.520 align:start position:0%
that's what we need to be doing that's
 
01:35:08.950 --> 01:35:08.960 align:start position:0%
what the community college system is
 
01:35:11.070 --> 01:35:11.080 align:start position:0%
doing and hopefully we can get more high
 
01:35:13.350 --> 01:35:13.360 align:start position:0%
schools doing that as well thank
 
01:35:18.270 --> 01:35:18.280 align:start position:0%
you all set thank you chairman lad oh
 
01:35:20.590 --> 01:35:20.600 align:start position:0%
yes representative Damon thank you Mr
 
01:35:22.070 --> 01:35:22.080 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking my question
 
01:35:23.910 --> 01:35:23.920 align:start position:0%
which may be for the community col
 
01:35:26.310 --> 01:35:26.320 align:start position:0%
person but following up on
 
01:35:27.870 --> 01:35:27.880 align:start position:0%
representative aims there are no
 
01:35:29.669 --> 01:35:29.679 align:start position:0%
Sullivan County Schools listed here
 
01:35:31.430 --> 01:35:31.440 align:start position:0%
either and so I'm wondering how the
 
01:35:35.390 --> 01:35:35.400 align:start position:0%
program gets promoted or marketed to
 
01:35:38.790 --> 01:35:38.800 align:start position:0%
school ask them thank
 
01:35:41.149 --> 01:35:41.159 align:start position:0%
you all right then thank you very much
 
01:35:43.950 --> 01:35:43.960 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman lad okay we have two
 
01:35:47.070 --> 01:35:47.080 align:start position:0%
uh from the community college system and
 
01:35:48.910 --> 01:35:48.920 align:start position:0%
so I'd like to call them forward
 
01:36:06.430 --> 01:36:06.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:08.550 --> 01:36:08.560 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr chairman and members of
 
01:36:10.550 --> 01:36:10.560 align:start position:0%
the committee uh for the record my name
 
01:36:12.709 --> 01:36:12.719 align:start position:0%
is Shannon Reed I represent the
 
01:36:13.830 --> 01:36:13.840 align:start position:0%
community college system of New
 
01:36:15.590 --> 01:36:15.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire which consists of seven
 
01:36:17.470 --> 01:36:17.480 align:start position:0%
colleges located across the state we
 
01:36:19.790 --> 01:36:19.800 align:start position:0%
offer associate degree and certificate
 
01:36:21.950 --> 01:36:21.960 align:start position:0%
education customized training with
 
01:36:24.109 --> 01:36:24.119 align:start position:0%
businesses and dual ment for New
 
01:36:26.270 --> 01:36:26.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire High School students um we're
 
01:36:28.870 --> 01:36:28.880 align:start position:0%
pleased to uh testify in support of the
 
01:36:31.109 --> 01:36:31.119 align:start position:0%
math learning communities bill um I'm
 
01:36:33.270 --> 01:36:33.280 align:start position:0%
joined today by Dr Chris Cony one of my
 
01:36:35.709 --> 01:36:35.719 align:start position:0%
colleagues who is a project director and
 
01:36:36.950 --> 01:36:36.960 align:start position:0%
she can answer all the detailed
 
01:36:38.550 --> 01:36:38.560 align:start position:0%
questions that you that you have had and
 
01:36:41.550 --> 01:36:41.560 align:start position:0%
others that come up um in addition to
 
01:36:43.189 --> 01:36:43.199 align:start position:0%
updating some of the language to bring
 
01:36:45.229 --> 01:36:45.239 align:start position:0%
it into alignment with how the program
 
01:36:47.350 --> 01:36:47.360 align:start position:0%
is evolving um this bill also contains
 
01:36:48.990 --> 01:36:49.000 align:start position:0%
an appropriation to enable us to
 
01:36:51.390 --> 01:36:51.400 align:start position:0%
continue it the we weren't really sure
 
01:36:53.070 --> 01:36:53.080 align:start position:0%
the function of this this funding
 
01:36:55.830 --> 01:36:55.840 align:start position:0%
committee versus the finance division 2
 
01:36:58.189 --> 01:36:58.199 align:start position:0%
and the finance committee so um I'm not
 
01:37:00.550 --> 01:37:00.560 align:start position:0%
sure where those pieces will be
 
01:37:02.750 --> 01:37:02.760 align:start position:0%
considered the language is important
 
01:37:05.270 --> 01:37:05.280 align:start position:0%
because it helps us to um make sure that
 
01:37:07.550 --> 01:37:07.560 align:start position:0%
the statutory language aligns with how
 
01:37:09.189 --> 01:37:09.199 align:start position:0%
the program is kind of changing over
 
01:37:12.430 --> 01:37:12.440 align:start position:0%
time we're trying to remove some of this
 
01:37:14.750 --> 01:37:14.760 align:start position:0%
um the specifics from the
 
01:37:17.870 --> 01:37:17.880 align:start position:0%
legislation so that every time we evolve
 
01:37:23.990 --> 01:37:24.000 align:start position:0%
in how we um how we assess how we uh
 
01:37:25.270 --> 01:37:25.280 align:start position:0%
structure the courses we don't have to
 
01:37:26.990 --> 01:37:27.000 align:start position:0%
come back to the legislature for for
 
01:37:29.669 --> 01:37:29.679 align:start position:0%
that type of detailed work
 
01:37:32.070 --> 01:37:32.080 align:start position:0%
um let's
 
01:37:35.470 --> 01:37:35.480 align:start position:0%
see the um one of the changes that we do
 
01:37:37.510 --> 01:37:37.520 align:start position:0%
seek to make in the funding is to enable
 
01:37:39.470 --> 01:37:39.480 align:start position:0%
us to bring our current part-time
 
01:37:41.430 --> 01:37:41.440 align:start position:0%
coordinator Dr coni into a full-time
 
01:37:44.629 --> 01:37:44.639 align:start position:0%
role so that we can build the program
 
01:37:46.030 --> 01:37:46.040 align:start position:0%
continue to reach out to more high
 
01:37:48.510 --> 01:37:48.520 align:start position:0%
schools um and continue to offer the
 
01:37:49.910 --> 01:37:49.920 align:start position:0%
professional development to teachers and
 
01:37:51.990 --> 01:37:52.000 align:start position:0%
deepen those Partnerships um because
 
01:37:53.750 --> 01:37:53.760 align:start position:0%
those Partnerships between the High
 
01:37:56.790 --> 01:37:56.800 align:start position:0%
School teachers and our college math
 
01:37:58.870 --> 01:37:58.880 align:start position:0%
teachers is really critical to kind of
 
01:38:00.270 --> 01:38:00.280 align:start position:0%
making sure that the that there's
 
01:38:01.669 --> 01:38:01.679 align:start position:0%
alignment between what students learned
 
01:38:03.149 --> 01:38:03.159 align:start position:0%
in high school and what they need to
 
01:38:04.990 --> 01:38:05.000 align:start position:0%
know for College and Career so with that
 
01:38:07.149 --> 01:38:07.159 align:start position:0%
I'll turn it over to Dr Kami to speak
 
01:38:09.750 --> 01:38:09.760 align:start position:0%
more about the the program as it um it
 
01:38:11.310 --> 01:38:11.320 align:start position:0%
was initially created and run for
 
01:38:13.830 --> 01:38:13.840 align:start position:0%
several years and the more recent reboot
 
01:38:16.270 --> 01:38:16.280 align:start position:0%
and her work to um expand this to more
 
01:38:21.870 --> 01:38:21.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:24.149 --> 01:38:24.159 align:start position:0%
Schools thank you very much for seeing
 
01:38:27.189 --> 01:38:27.199 align:start position:0%
us today um I am Dr Chris Cony and I am
 
01:38:28.910 --> 01:38:28.920 align:start position:0%
the Project Director for the math
 
01:38:30.790 --> 01:38:30.800 align:start position:0%
learning communities at the community
 
01:38:33.390 --> 01:38:33.400 align:start position:0%
college system of New Hampshire um and
 
01:38:36.310 --> 01:38:36.320 align:start position:0%
thank you to representative lad for a
 
01:38:39.030 --> 01:38:39.040 align:start position:0%
good um overview of the program as it is
 
01:38:41.669 --> 01:38:41.679 align:start position:0%
uh makes my job a little easier um as he
 
01:38:44.109 --> 01:38:44.119 align:start position:0%
mentioned this program initially started
 
01:38:46.870 --> 01:38:46.880 align:start position:0%
in 2006 and ran through
 
01:38:51.189 --> 01:38:51.199 align:start position:0%
2017 through various federal funds um
 
01:38:53.470 --> 01:38:53.480 align:start position:0%
however a lot of those funds are
 
01:38:55.390 --> 01:38:55.400 align:start position:0%
designated towards startup programs and
 
01:38:57.470 --> 01:38:57.480 align:start position:0%
once you have a program that's running
 
01:38:59.589 --> 01:38:59.599 align:start position:0%
operational um and is no longer
 
01:39:01.629 --> 01:39:01.639 align:start position:0%
considered a startup those funds are no
 
01:39:03.229 --> 01:39:03.239 align:start position:0%
longer available and there weren't any
 
01:39:05.550 --> 01:39:05.560 align:start position:0%
other funds to replace those so
 
01:39:07.149 --> 01:39:07.159 align:start position:0%
unfortunately even though the program
 
01:39:09.390 --> 01:39:09.400 align:start position:0%
was seeing a lot of success with the
 
01:39:12.109 --> 01:39:12.119 align:start position:0%
increase of scores on the accuplacer at
 
01:39:14.629 --> 01:39:14.639 align:start position:0%
the time um and the decrease in the
 
01:39:16.870 --> 01:39:16.880 align:start position:0%
number of students enrolling in remedial
 
01:39:18.830 --> 01:39:18.840 align:start position:0%
math courses at the college and
 
01:39:21.589 --> 01:39:21.599 align:start position:0%
university level um with the absence of
 
01:39:24.950 --> 01:39:24.960 align:start position:0%
that funding the program did go away
 
01:39:28.830 --> 01:39:28.840 align:start position:0%
um part of that is because a significant
 
01:39:31.669 --> 01:39:31.679 align:start position:0%
part of our funding as the program
 
01:39:34.390 --> 01:39:34.400 align:start position:0%
becomes operational and rolls forward is
 
01:39:36.350 --> 01:39:36.360 align:start position:0%
for ongoing teacher training and
 
01:39:39.350 --> 01:39:39.360 align:start position:0%
development so um without that ongoing
 
01:39:41.470 --> 01:39:41.480 align:start position:0%
teacher training and development it just
 
01:39:44.390 --> 01:39:44.400 align:start position:0%
was not possible to continue to
 
01:39:47.109 --> 01:39:47.119 align:start position:0%
implement this program in its full form
 
01:39:49.109 --> 01:39:49.119 align:start position:0%
there were a lot of high schools however
 
01:39:51.350 --> 01:39:51.360 align:start position:0%
who continued to offer the courses that
 
01:39:53.709 --> 01:39:53.719 align:start position:0%
had been developed in the program um
 
01:39:57.470 --> 01:39:57.480 align:start position:0%
even up until today so um that in
 
01:39:59.830 --> 01:39:59.840 align:start position:0%
addition to the increase in scores and
 
01:40:04.070 --> 01:40:04.080 align:start position:0%
decrease in um remediation later on that
 
01:40:05.629 --> 01:40:05.639 align:start position:0%
is kind of a testimony to how the
 
01:40:05.639 --> 01:40:07.149 align:start position:0%
is kind of a testimony to how the
program

01:40:07.149 --> 01:40:07.159 align:start position:0%
program
 
01:40:10.310 --> 01:40:10.320 align:start position:0%
began when this bill was funded the
 
01:40:13.669 --> 01:40:13.679 align:start position:0%
originally um the program was able to
 
01:40:16.910 --> 01:40:16.920 align:start position:0%
restart and um after I was the initial
 
01:40:20.390 --> 01:40:20.400 align:start position:0%
hire for the program we implemented and
 
01:40:22.870 --> 01:40:22.880 align:start position:0%
created a project leadership team and
 
01:40:24.870 --> 01:40:24.880 align:start position:0%
that project leadership team is
 
01:40:26.470 --> 01:40:26.480 align:start position:0%
responsible for the development of the
 
01:40:28.310 --> 01:40:28.320 align:start position:0%
curriculum and that consists of
 
01:40:30.350 --> 01:40:30.360 align:start position:0%
community college math department heads
 
01:40:32.790 --> 01:40:32.800 align:start position:0%
in partnership with high school teachers
 
01:40:36.709 --> 01:40:36.719 align:start position:0%
so that committee um of that combination
 
01:40:38.830 --> 01:40:38.840 align:start position:0%
of the community college and high school
 
01:40:40.589 --> 01:40:40.599 align:start position:0%
are the ones who will be developing the
 
01:40:42.950 --> 01:40:42.960 align:start position:0%
curriculum and the decision was made
 
01:40:45.709 --> 01:40:45.719 align:start position:0%
rather than just reinstituting the
 
01:40:47.950 --> 01:40:47.960 align:start position:0%
courses that were created back in the
 
01:40:51.070 --> 01:40:51.080 align:start position:0%
early 2000s let's take a look at what
 
01:40:55.470 --> 01:40:55.480 align:start position:0%
today's student needs and in doing so um
 
01:40:58.390 --> 01:40:58.400 align:start position:0%
we created a new you know we we took a
 
01:41:01.270 --> 01:41:01.280 align:start position:0%
look at students coming into this
 
01:41:03.629 --> 01:41:03.639 align:start position:0%
program in the past trying to prepare
 
01:41:06.830 --> 01:41:06.840 align:start position:0%
them for Algebra 2 and there was still a
 
01:41:09.709 --> 01:41:09.719 align:start position:0%
primary focus there of college readiness
 
01:41:12.229 --> 01:41:12.239 align:start position:0%
we decided to expand our Focus to any
 
01:41:14.189 --> 01:41:14.199 align:start position:0%
kind of post-secondary pathway that
 
01:41:16.709 --> 01:41:16.719 align:start position:0%
students would be interested in pursuing
 
01:41:18.390 --> 01:41:18.400 align:start position:0%
so we want our program not just to
 
01:41:20.629 --> 01:41:20.639 align:start position:0%
prepare students for college but if
 
01:41:21.990 --> 01:41:22.000 align:start position:0%
they're going into the military if
 
01:41:23.270 --> 01:41:23.280 align:start position:0%
they're going into trades or
 
01:41:24.790 --> 01:41:24.800 align:start position:0%
apprenticeship programs if they're going
 
01:41:27.149 --> 01:41:27.159 align:start position:0%
directly into career programs we wanted
 
01:41:28.990 --> 01:41:29.000 align:start position:0%
to make sure that this program provided
 
01:41:30.550 --> 01:41:30.560 align:start position:0%
them all of the math skills that they
 
01:41:33.950 --> 01:41:33.960 align:start position:0%
would need so what we did was met with
 
01:41:36.189 --> 01:41:36.199 align:start position:0%
the university system to make sure that
 
01:41:37.990 --> 01:41:38.000 align:start position:0%
the content that we have in our Algebra
 
01:41:40.790 --> 01:41:40.800 align:start position:0%
2 course meets the entry requirements
 
01:41:45.109 --> 01:41:45.119 align:start position:0%
for the University system but doesn't
 
01:41:47.870 --> 01:41:47.880 align:start position:0%
necessarily proceed beyond that um a lot
 
01:41:50.189 --> 01:41:50.199 align:start position:0%
of Algebra 2 content traditionally has
 
01:41:51.990 --> 01:41:52.000 align:start position:0%
included things that are preparing
 
01:41:53.950 --> 01:41:53.960 align:start position:0%
students to take calculus
 
01:41:57.109 --> 01:41:57.119 align:start position:0%
and unless you're on a stem path um that
 
01:41:59.550 --> 01:41:59.560 align:start position:0%
isn't something that most students need
 
01:42:02.790 --> 01:42:02.800 align:start position:0%
so rather than including those elements
 
01:42:05.149 --> 01:42:05.159 align:start position:0%
we were able to redesign the course that
 
01:42:07.189 --> 01:42:07.199 align:start position:0%
included more quantitative reasoning
 
01:42:09.990 --> 01:42:10.000 align:start position:0%
skills number Theory and other types of
 
01:42:11.750 --> 01:42:11.760 align:start position:0%
things that will serve students
 
01:42:13.229 --> 01:42:13.239 align:start position:0%
regardless of what their path to the
 
01:42:16.189 --> 01:42:16.199 align:start position:0%
Future would be we also took a look at
 
01:42:18.310 --> 01:42:18.320 align:start position:0%
the dual enrollment course that was
 
01:42:20.310 --> 01:42:20.320 align:start position:0%
going to be offered as the second course
 
01:42:23.229 --> 01:42:23.239 align:start position:0%
for these students and in looking at
 
01:42:26.390 --> 01:42:26.400 align:start position:0%
today's environment today's world um and
 
01:42:28.390 --> 01:42:28.400 align:start position:0%
also looking at College programs and
 
01:42:29.910 --> 01:42:29.920 align:start position:0%
other programs that students might
 
01:42:32.629 --> 01:42:32.639 align:start position:0%
proceed into it was determined to offer
 
01:42:36.030 --> 01:42:36.040 align:start position:0%
a statistics course to those students um
 
01:42:38.149 --> 01:42:38.159 align:start position:0%
that statistics course transfers in at
 
01:42:39.950 --> 01:42:39.960 align:start position:0%
the college level it transfers in at the
 
01:42:42.030 --> 01:42:42.040 align:start position:0%
University level it meets the
 
01:42:44.310 --> 01:42:44.320 align:start position:0%
quantitative uh literacy requirements at
 
01:42:46.149 --> 01:42:46.159 align:start position:0%
our University system and our community
 
01:42:48.629 --> 01:42:48.639 align:start position:0%
college system it also meets the math
 
01:42:50.470 --> 01:42:50.480 align:start position:0%
requirements for many of the majors at
 
01:42:52.910 --> 01:42:52.920 align:start position:0%
the college so this also gives students
 
01:42:55.709 --> 01:42:55.719 align:start position:0%
a Head Start if they do decide to follow
 
01:42:57.350 --> 01:42:57.360 align:start position:0%
a career path that's going to take them
 
01:42:59.430 --> 01:42:59.440 align:start position:0%
to college or some post-secondary
 
01:43:01.790 --> 01:43:01.800 align:start position:0%
schooling that would require that even a
 
01:43:03.350 --> 01:43:03.360 align:start position:0%
lot of the trades and apprenticeships
 
01:43:05.109 --> 01:43:05.119 align:start position:0%
require um
 
01:43:09.430 --> 01:43:09.440 align:start position:0%
statistics um as a happy coincidence um
 
01:43:11.830 --> 01:43:11.840 align:start position:0%
the State Board of Education is also uh
 
01:43:14.430 --> 01:43:14.440 align:start position:0%
working on requiring statistics to be a
 
01:43:15.910 --> 01:43:15.920 align:start position:0%
course that students take before they
 
01:43:18.149 --> 01:43:18.159 align:start position:0%
complete high school so we're already
 
01:43:21.229 --> 01:43:21.239 align:start position:0%
ahead of the game when it comes to that
 
01:43:23.470 --> 01:43:23.480 align:start position:0%
um we in this first year we're in a
 
01:43:25.430 --> 01:43:25.440 align:start position:0%
development year right now and as
 
01:43:27.189 --> 01:43:27.199 align:start position:0%
representative lad said we are in a
 
01:43:30.189 --> 01:43:30.199 align:start position:0%
recruiting phase of bringing on board um
 
01:43:32.430 --> 01:43:32.440 align:start position:0%
schools while our project leadership
 
01:43:34.550 --> 01:43:34.560 align:start position:0%
team is in the process of preparing the
 
01:43:37.030 --> 01:43:37.040 align:start position:0%
curriculum and the training for that so
 
01:43:38.750 --> 01:43:38.760 align:start position:0%
our first schools will be implementing
 
01:43:40.709 --> 01:43:40.719 align:start position:0%
this program in the fall of
 
01:43:44.550 --> 01:43:44.560 align:start position:0%
25 and we have um now 13 schools that
 
01:43:46.310 --> 01:43:46.320 align:start position:0%
have already committed to starting this
 
01:43:48.990 --> 01:43:49.000 align:start position:0%
program in the fall of 25 we have two
 
01:43:50.950 --> 01:43:50.960 align:start position:0%
schools already committed and when I say
 
01:43:52.310 --> 01:43:52.320 align:start position:0%
committed I mean that their
 
01:43:54.229 --> 01:43:54.239 align:start position:0%
superintendent already signed memorandum
 
01:43:56.589 --> 01:43:56.599 align:start position:0%
of understandings so that's about as
 
01:44:00.390 --> 01:44:00.400 align:start position:0%
committed as you can get um they we also
 
01:44:01.830 --> 01:44:01.840 align:start position:0%
have two schools that have already
 
01:44:05.070 --> 01:44:05.080 align:start position:0%
committed to start in the fall of 26 um
 
01:44:07.669 --> 01:44:07.679 align:start position:0%
if you're not familiar with how schools
 
01:44:10.589 --> 01:44:10.599 align:start position:0%
um operate from a curriculum perspective
 
01:44:13.830 --> 01:44:13.840 align:start position:0%
um they typically need to plan a year in
 
01:44:15.470 --> 01:44:15.480 align:start position:0%
advance for when they make curricular
 
01:44:18.229 --> 01:44:18.239 align:start position:0%
changes so as we started recruiting
 
01:44:19.830 --> 01:44:19.840 align:start position:0%
schools in September there were already
 
01:44:21.510 --> 01:44:21.520 align:start position:0%
a lot of schools that it was too late in
 
01:44:23.990 --> 01:44:24.000 align:start position:0%
the process for them to do that so we
 
01:44:26.109 --> 01:44:26.119 align:start position:0%
have a number of schools already lined
 
01:44:30.149 --> 01:44:30.159 align:start position:0%
up um who are very interested in in uh
 
01:44:32.550 --> 01:44:32.560 align:start position:0%
offering this in in Fall of 26 and this
 
01:44:34.390 --> 01:44:34.400 align:start position:0%
year we'll be working through that
 
01:44:36.149 --> 01:44:36.159 align:start position:0%
formal curricular process with their
 
01:44:38.910 --> 01:44:38.920 align:start position:0%
school districts we also have a
 
01:44:41.470 --> 01:44:41.480 align:start position:0%
significant number of schools that
 
01:44:44.310 --> 01:44:44.320 align:start position:0%
are anxious to see how this first year
 
01:44:46.470 --> 01:44:46.480 align:start position:0%
goes they would like to see now that the
 
01:44:48.750 --> 01:44:48.760 align:start position:0%
program is being rebooted um they're
 
01:44:50.589 --> 01:44:50.599 align:start position:0%
very excited about the changes in the
 
01:44:52.589 --> 01:44:52.599 align:start position:0%
program which I'll talk to about in a
 
01:44:54.229 --> 01:44:54.239 align:start position:0%
moment but they want to see that those
 
01:44:57.550 --> 01:44:57.560 align:start position:0%
changes are uh taking effect and having
 
01:44:59.470 --> 01:44:59.480 align:start position:0%
the the required effect on
 
01:45:01.950 --> 01:45:01.960 align:start position:0%
students um some of the changes that
 
01:45:05.390 --> 01:45:05.400 align:start position:0%
we're making to the original program um
 
01:45:07.350 --> 01:45:07.360 align:start position:0%
we already mentioned that the accuplacer
 
01:45:09.430 --> 01:45:09.440 align:start position:0%
test has is no longer in use for the
 
01:45:10.750 --> 01:45:10.760 align:start position:0%
most part at the community college
 
01:45:13.310 --> 01:45:13.320 align:start position:0%
system of New Hampshire and that's being
 
01:45:14.990 --> 01:45:15.000 align:start position:0%
replaced not only at the Community
 
01:45:17.189 --> 01:45:17.199 align:start position:0%
College Center but also uh will be doing
 
01:45:19.390 --> 01:45:19.400 align:start position:0%
that within this program by other
 
01:45:22.270 --> 01:45:22.280 align:start position:0%
measures and what Nationwide is being
 
01:45:24.990 --> 01:45:25.000 align:start position:0%
done right now is a system of multiple
 
01:45:27.070 --> 01:45:27.080 align:start position:0%
measures is the thing that is is working
 
01:45:29.390 --> 01:45:29.400 align:start position:0%
out better so even if there is an
 
01:45:32.109 --> 01:45:32.119 align:start position:0%
assessment exam of some type that isn't
 
01:45:33.750 --> 01:45:33.760 align:start position:0%
the only thing that we'll be looking at
 
01:45:35.470 --> 01:45:35.480 align:start position:0%
we'll be looking at teacher
 
01:45:37.270 --> 01:45:37.280 align:start position:0%
recommendations parent
 
01:45:39.790 --> 01:45:39.800 align:start position:0%
recommendations um guidance counsel
 
01:45:41.830 --> 01:45:41.840 align:start position:0%
recommendations uh we may be doing a
 
01:45:44.270 --> 01:45:44.280 align:start position:0%
student self- assessment survey a lot of
 
01:45:46.070 --> 01:45:46.080 align:start position:0%
times when you ask students what they
 
01:45:48.030 --> 01:45:48.040 align:start position:0%
feel comfortable with and what they know
 
01:45:50.350 --> 01:45:50.360 align:start position:0%
they are the best judge of what they do
 
01:45:53.870 --> 01:45:53.880 align:start position:0%
and don't know um and so we'll be using
 
01:45:58.270 --> 01:45:58.280 align:start position:0%
all of those and our goal is basically
 
01:46:00.550 --> 01:46:00.560 align:start position:0%
to design a non-level version of this
 
01:46:02.750 --> 01:46:02.760 align:start position:0%
algebra 2 course that almost all
 
01:46:05.350 --> 01:46:05.360 align:start position:0%
students will be able to take we don't
 
01:46:07.470 --> 01:46:07.480 align:start position:0%
want to have a leveled course um
 
01:46:09.750 --> 01:46:09.760 align:start position:0%
statistics show that leveling is not
 
01:46:13.109 --> 01:46:13.119 align:start position:0%
effective in education um as it once had
 
01:46:15.790 --> 01:46:15.800 align:start position:0%
been thought to be so creating a course
 
01:46:18.109 --> 01:46:18.119 align:start position:0%
that's going to be accessible by all is
 
01:46:20.270 --> 01:46:20.280 align:start position:0%
the direction we want to go the only
 
01:46:22.470 --> 01:46:22.480 align:start position:0%
students who may not take this course in
 
01:46:24.109 --> 01:46:24.119 align:start position:0%
some of the larger high schools is
 
01:46:26.629 --> 01:46:26.639 align:start position:0%
students who are on a very firm path
 
01:46:29.070 --> 01:46:29.080 align:start position:0%
towards a stem career those high schools
 
01:46:31.030 --> 01:46:31.040 align:start position:0%
may continue to offer another version of
 
01:46:33.830 --> 01:46:33.840 align:start position:0%
Algebra 2 that prepares them for
 
01:46:37.310 --> 01:46:37.320 align:start position:0%
calculus um the other most significant
 
01:46:40.430 --> 01:46:40.440 align:start position:0%
change that this Pro program makes to
 
01:46:42.510 --> 01:46:42.520 align:start position:0%
the way that math is
 
01:46:45.310 --> 01:46:45.320 align:start position:0%
taught is that it is no longer an
 
01:46:47.669 --> 01:46:47.679 align:start position:0%
algorithm memorization base where the
 
01:46:50.270 --> 01:46:50.280 align:start position:0%
teacher comes in and teaches you here's
 
01:46:52.109 --> 01:46:52.119 align:start position:0%
the topic of the day these are the notes
 
01:46:53.270 --> 01:46:53.280 align:start position:0%
we're going to be taking now we're going
 
01:46:55.750 --> 01:46:55.760 align:start position:0%
to have you try some problems the method
 
01:46:57.149 --> 01:46:57.159 align:start position:0%
that we're employing and this is
 
01:47:00.109 --> 01:47:00.119 align:start position:0%
something that's being employed by um
 
01:47:02.390 --> 01:47:02.400 align:start position:0%
there's a Consortium called The Learning
 
01:47:05.030 --> 01:47:05.040 align:start position:0%
um learning years initiative and there's
 
01:47:07.109 --> 01:47:07.119 align:start position:0%
a Consortium of 23 States already
 
01:47:09.510 --> 01:47:09.520 align:start position:0%
involved in that in um working on
 
01:47:12.149 --> 01:47:12.159 align:start position:0%
creating new curriculum that support
 
01:47:14.030 --> 01:47:14.040 align:start position:0%
this kind of exploratory
 
01:47:17.510 --> 01:47:17.520 align:start position:0%
base and um with a lot of grant funding
 
01:47:19.430 --> 01:47:19.440 align:start position:0%
have developed curricular materials that
 
01:47:20.790 --> 01:47:20.800 align:start position:0%
we're actually going to be able to take
 
01:47:23.229 --> 01:47:23.239 align:start position:0%
advantage of at no cost to give to our
 
01:47:27.270 --> 01:47:27.280 align:start position:0%
high schools so in the way that this
 
01:47:30.390 --> 01:47:30.400 align:start position:0%
teaches and as representative lad we you
 
01:47:33.149 --> 01:47:33.159 align:start position:0%
know uh mentioned at the conference last
 
01:47:35.350 --> 01:47:35.360 align:start position:0%
September we contacted schools around
 
01:47:36.910 --> 01:47:36.920 align:start position:0%
the state and said come see what we're
 
01:47:39.669 --> 01:47:39.679 align:start position:0%
about come take you know see an example
 
01:47:40.830 --> 01:47:40.840 align:start position:0%
of what we're going to be doing with
 
01:47:43.990 --> 01:47:44.000 align:start position:0%
your students and that is a task-based
 
01:47:46.430 --> 01:47:46.440 align:start position:0%
process where students are allowed to
 
01:47:49.669 --> 01:47:49.679 align:start position:0%
explore a concept and come to understand
 
01:47:52.189 --> 01:47:52.199 align:start position:0%
it on their own so rather than being
 
01:47:53.629 --> 01:47:53.639 align:start position:0%
presented with knowledge that you're
 
01:47:56.229 --> 01:47:56.239 align:start position:0%
supposed to memorize and remember later
 
01:47:58.270 --> 01:47:58.280 align:start position:0%
we're going to present problems that
 
01:48:00.310 --> 01:48:00.320 align:start position:0%
students are going to explore they're
 
01:48:01.830 --> 01:48:01.840 align:start position:0%
going to find challenging they're going
 
01:48:03.790 --> 01:48:03.800 align:start position:0%
to make mistakes they're going to figure
 
01:48:06.189 --> 01:48:06.199 align:start position:0%
out what to do with those mistakes and
 
01:48:08.910 --> 01:48:08.920 align:start position:0%
that kind of exploratory learning leads
 
01:48:12.709 --> 01:48:12.719 align:start position:0%
more to Mastery and also remaster if you
 
01:48:14.830 --> 01:48:14.840 align:start position:0%
learn how to learn effectively then when
 
01:48:16.270 --> 01:48:16.280 align:start position:0%
you need to do something again in the
 
01:48:20.030 --> 01:48:20.040 align:start position:0%
future you're able to um do that more
 
01:48:23.870 --> 01:48:23.880 align:start position:0%
successfully so um that
 
01:48:26.030 --> 01:48:26.040 align:start position:0%
is is kind of the program in a nutshell
 
01:48:28.470 --> 01:48:28.480 align:start position:0%
the the differences in the the changes
 
01:48:29.990 --> 01:48:30.000 align:start position:0%
that we're making to the bill for this
 
01:48:33.709 --> 01:48:33.719 align:start position:0%
time around um the original program was
 
01:48:36.030 --> 01:48:36.040 align:start position:0%
geared towards High School juniors and
 
01:48:39.669 --> 01:48:39.679 align:start position:0%
seniors one of the primary feedback that
 
01:48:41.550 --> 01:48:41.560 align:start position:0%
we got very vocally at the conference
 
01:48:43.350 --> 01:48:43.360 align:start position:0%
that we had in September is why are we
 
01:48:46.430 --> 01:48:46.440 align:start position:0%
waiting so long it's it's you know I
 
01:48:48.550 --> 01:48:48.560 align:start position:0%
never want to say it's too late but it
 
01:48:50.709 --> 01:48:50.719 align:start position:0%
is very late to start saying let's help
 
01:48:53.070 --> 01:48:53.080 align:start position:0%
students master math in as Junior in
 
01:48:55.390 --> 01:48:55.400 align:start position:0%
high school so a lot of the high school
 
01:48:57.149 --> 01:48:57.159 align:start position:0%
teachers said can't we please start with
 
01:48:59.830 --> 01:48:59.840 align:start position:0%
algebra 1 can't we consider doing this
 
01:49:01.550 --> 01:49:01.560 align:start position:0%
down in the middle school so part of the
 
01:49:04.669 --> 01:49:04.679 align:start position:0%
rewording of this bill was to allow us
 
01:49:07.550 --> 01:49:07.560 align:start position:0%
the flexibility to offer and create any
 
01:49:10.350 --> 01:49:10.360 align:start position:0%
math course and our goal going forward
 
01:49:12.270 --> 01:49:12.280 align:start position:0%
would be starting with algebra 2 because
 
01:49:13.750 --> 01:49:13.760 align:start position:0%
that's what we had to start with under
 
01:49:15.750 --> 01:49:15.760 align:start position:0%
the current wording and then start
 
01:49:18.990 --> 01:49:19.000 align:start position:0%
working um backwards and create uh
 
01:49:21.310 --> 01:49:21.320 align:start position:0%
similar courses for all four years in
 
01:49:24.950 --> 01:49:24.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:28.030 --> 01:49:28.040 align:start position:0%
um that that was one of the Prime that's
 
01:49:29.790 --> 01:49:29.800 align:start position:0%
pretty much the primary change that we
 
01:49:32.149 --> 01:49:32.159 align:start position:0%
wanted to make um in the way that things
 
01:49:35.669 --> 01:49:35.679 align:start position:0%
were going to be doing um we also wanted
 
01:49:38.669 --> 01:49:38.679 align:start position:0%
to change some of the wording around
 
01:49:42.390 --> 01:49:42.400 align:start position:0%
students who are not ready for Algebra 2
 
01:49:45.870 --> 01:49:45.880 align:start position:0%
um students who are going into Algebra 2
 
01:49:48.629 --> 01:49:48.639 align:start position:0%
have had algebra over and over again for
 
01:49:50.550 --> 01:49:50.560 align:start position:0%
several years starting in the middle
 
01:49:52.189 --> 01:49:52.199 align:start position:0%
school and progressing up through
 
01:49:55.270 --> 01:49:55.280 align:start position:0%
algebra in high school in Geometry again
 
01:49:56.790 --> 01:49:56.800 align:start position:0%
we don't believe that there should be
 
01:49:59.350 --> 01:49:59.360 align:start position:0%
any students who aren't ready to tackle
 
01:50:02.109 --> 01:50:02.119 align:start position:0%
the next level of topics we just need to
 
01:50:03.990 --> 01:50:04.000 align:start position:0%
do it in a different way because what's
 
01:50:06.270 --> 01:50:06.280 align:start position:0%
been done but in the past is not working
 
01:50:08.470 --> 01:50:08.480 align:start position:0%
effectively so we know that that
 
01:50:10.550 --> 01:50:10.560 align:start position:0%
knowledge is in their mind they've been
 
01:50:13.310 --> 01:50:13.320 align:start position:0%
exposed to those topics and so we want
 
01:50:17.470 --> 01:50:17.480 align:start position:0%
to be able to say that um we can use
 
01:50:20.589 --> 01:50:20.599 align:start position:0%
this course to now move students forward
 
01:50:22.750 --> 01:50:22.760 align:start position:0%
regardless of where their grades or
 
01:50:23.990 --> 01:50:24.000 align:start position:0%
other things might indicate their
 
01:50:26.950 --> 01:50:26.960 align:start position:0%
knowledge level actually
 
01:50:30.229 --> 01:50:30.239 align:start position:0%
is thank you thank you very much I'd
 
01:50:32.070 --> 01:50:32.080 align:start position:0%
like to lead with a clarification and a
 
01:50:35.390 --> 01:50:35.400 align:start position:0%
brief question uh this has an
 
01:50:37.430 --> 01:50:37.440 align:start position:0%
appropriation so it's a two committee
 
01:50:39.750 --> 01:50:39.760 align:start position:0%
Bill and it will go on to the finance
 
01:50:42.589 --> 01:50:42.599 align:start position:0%
committee both committees will review uh
 
01:50:45.629 --> 01:50:45.639 align:start position:0%
so what specifically is the difference
 
01:50:48.310 --> 01:50:48.320 align:start position:0%
in the spending level requested for FY
 
01:50:52.189 --> 01:50:52.199 align:start position:0%
26 and 27 200 versus 250,000 what
 
01:50:52.199 --> 01:50:53.149 align:start position:0%
26 and 27 200 versus 250,000 what
changes

01:50:53.149 --> 01:50:53.159 align:start position:0%
changes
 
01:50:56.229 --> 01:50:56.239 align:start position:0%
um because we started this program well
 
01:50:58.990 --> 01:50:59.000 align:start position:0%
into the current bium we didn't expend
 
01:51:00.790 --> 01:51:00.800 align:start position:0%
all the funds in year ones we were able
 
01:51:03.430 --> 01:51:03.440 align:start position:0%
to roll some into this into this coming
 
01:51:06.149 --> 01:51:06.159 align:start position:0%
bayum that's last first year other
 
01:51:06.159 --> 01:51:09.830 align:start position:0%
bayum that's last first year other
questions

01:51:09.830 --> 01:51:09.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:13.149 --> 01:51:13.159 align:start position:0%
yes so let me just oh thank you thank
 
01:51:15.950 --> 01:51:15.960 align:start position:0%
you let me just start by saying that for
 
01:51:18.870 --> 01:51:18.880 align:start position:0%
um most of my career I was a math and
 
01:51:21.350 --> 01:51:21.360 align:start position:0%
physics teacher so I commend you on
 
01:51:24.669 --> 01:51:24.679 align:start position:0%
these I looked for for many of these
 
01:51:29.229 --> 01:51:29.239 align:start position:0%
types of um learning opportunities for
 
01:51:32.629 --> 01:51:32.639 align:start position:0%
my students um I have one clarifying
 
01:51:34.109 --> 01:51:34.119 align:start position:0%
question did you say it was called
 
01:51:37.270 --> 01:51:37.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:39.669 --> 01:51:39.679 align:start position:0%
initiative um sorry it's the thank you
 
01:51:41.470 --> 01:51:41.480 align:start position:0%
for the question it's the launch years
 
01:51:45.750 --> 01:51:45.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:49.030 --> 01:51:49.040 align:start position:0%
sorry and so I I want to come back to
 
01:51:51.669 --> 01:51:51.679 align:start position:0%
the data that I had asked representative
 
01:51:55.390 --> 01:51:55.400 align:start position:0%
lad about do we do is there some report
 
01:52:00.790 --> 01:52:00.800 align:start position:0%
or was there a yearly um data dump I I
 
01:52:04.870 --> 01:52:04.880 align:start position:0%
that you you did dur in the 2006 to
 
01:52:09.109 --> 01:52:09.119 align:start position:0%
2017 years of um I I mean I know that
 
01:52:11.189 --> 01:52:11.199 align:start position:0%
this will make this is different we're
 
01:52:14.189 --> 01:52:14.199 align:start position:0%
using different assessments um but I
 
01:52:16.990 --> 01:52:17.000 align:start position:0%
would really like to see that data that
 
01:52:19.149 --> 01:52:19.159 align:start position:0%
happened and I also want you to know
 
01:52:20.669 --> 01:52:20.679 align:start position:0%
that I am chair of the May ma Valley
 
01:52:22.109 --> 01:52:22.119 align:start position:0%
School District so I'm glad to see that
 
01:52:25.950 --> 01:52:25.960 align:start position:0%
may Val is um thank you very much Mar
 
01:52:27.430 --> 01:52:27.440 align:start position:0%
Mac Valley was actually the first one to
 
01:52:30.030 --> 01:52:30.040 align:start position:0%
sign of course they were CU Randy was a
 
01:52:31.990 --> 01:52:32.000 align:start position:0%
math teacher
 
01:52:35.910 --> 01:52:35.920 align:start position:0%
also um as far as the data from the past
 
01:52:39.629 --> 01:52:39.639 align:start position:0%
uh we have had some challenges with
 
01:52:42.430 --> 01:52:42.440 align:start position:0%
getting the past data we do have data
 
01:52:44.589 --> 01:52:44.599 align:start position:0%
from one year somewhere in the middle
 
01:52:46.510 --> 01:52:46.520 align:start position:0%
between the two that showed an increase
 
01:52:48.390 --> 01:52:48.400 align:start position:0%
from 40 uh you know students would take
 
01:52:50.870 --> 01:52:50.880 align:start position:0%
the acup Placer before the class and
 
01:52:52.669 --> 01:52:52.679 align:start position:0%
then they would take the the accuplacer
 
01:52:55.790 --> 01:52:55.800 align:start position:0%
after the test uh after the class and
 
01:52:58.430 --> 01:52:58.440 align:start position:0%
their scores went from approximately 40%
 
01:53:01.149 --> 01:53:01.159 align:start position:0%
to 70% on the exam and you know so there
 
01:53:04.990 --> 01:53:05.000 align:start position:0%
was a very significant increase um as I
 
01:53:06.470 --> 01:53:06.480 align:start position:0%
mentioned we're not going to be using
 
01:53:10.310 --> 01:53:10.320 align:start position:0%
the accuplacer again so we will start
 
01:53:13.750 --> 01:53:13.760 align:start position:0%
with data collection again this year um
 
01:53:15.950 --> 01:53:15.960 align:start position:0%
although a lot of the you know if we
 
01:53:17.950 --> 01:53:17.960 align:start position:0%
look nationally at the lawn shars
 
01:53:19.990 --> 01:53:20.000 align:start position:0%
initiative and other things like that
 
01:53:22.069 --> 01:53:22.079 align:start position:0%
they are already showing significant
 
01:53:24.030 --> 01:53:24.040 align:start position:0%
Improvement ments in students abilities
 
01:53:26.790 --> 01:53:26.800 align:start position:0%
not only in math classes but in other um
 
01:53:29.470 --> 01:53:29.480 align:start position:0%
related classes as well because a lot of
 
01:53:31.109 --> 01:53:31.119 align:start position:0%
what gets addressed in this course as
 
01:53:33.870 --> 01:53:33.880 align:start position:0%
well is social emotional learning um you
 
01:53:35.990 --> 01:53:36.000 align:start position:0%
know for example what I mentioned before
 
01:53:38.550 --> 01:53:38.560 align:start position:0%
you know learning comes from making
 
01:53:40.229 --> 01:53:40.239 align:start position:0%
mistakes and growing comfortable with
 
01:53:41.669 --> 01:53:41.679 align:start position:0%
making mistakes and that that's
 
01:53:47.830 --> 01:53:47.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:50.310 --> 01:53:50.320 align:start position:0%
mathematics yes representative fellas um
 
01:53:52.430 --> 01:53:52.440 align:start position:0%
can you just clarify the dates because
 
01:53:55.669 --> 01:53:55.679 align:start position:0%
as you said it started back in 2006 but
 
01:53:57.589 --> 01:53:57.599 align:start position:0%
then something happened and when did it
 
01:54:00.910 --> 01:54:00.920 align:start position:0%
start up again and also do you can you
 
01:54:02.750 --> 01:54:02.760 align:start position:0%
tell me anything about how many teachers
 
01:54:07.390 --> 01:54:07.400 align:start position:0%
have been participating in this sure so
 
01:54:09.910 --> 01:54:09.920 align:start position:0%
um the original program um the first
 
01:54:13.390 --> 01:54:13.400 align:start position:0%
granted that they received was in 2006
 
01:54:15.750 --> 01:54:15.760 align:start position:0%
those um and there were three or four
 
01:54:18.310 --> 01:54:18.320 align:start position:0%
different grants that it um fell under
 
01:54:21.390 --> 01:54:21.400 align:start position:0%
over the years 2017 is the last year
 
01:54:24.510 --> 01:54:24.520 align:start position:0%
that it ran before the program um kind
 
01:54:27.149 --> 01:54:27.159 align:start position:0%
of fell apart and as far as the number
 
01:54:30.470 --> 01:54:30.480 align:start position:0%
of teachers participating um that is
 
01:54:32.030 --> 01:54:32.040 align:start position:0%
kind of a rolling number at this point
 
01:54:34.990 --> 01:54:35.000 align:start position:0%
so just to give you some examples um
 
01:54:38.350 --> 01:54:38.360 align:start position:0%
last August when we um put out the
 
01:54:38.360 --> 01:54:39.990 align:start position:0%
last August when we um put out the
conference

01:54:39.990 --> 01:54:40.000 align:start position:0%
conference
 
01:54:43.109 --> 01:54:43.119 align:start position:0%
we literally came to the idea that even
 
01:54:44.790 --> 01:54:44.800 align:start position:0%
though the program hadn't launched yet
 
01:54:46.669 --> 01:54:46.679 align:start position:0%
we wanted to get a lot of feedback from
 
01:54:48.550 --> 01:54:48.560 align:start position:0%
teachers and be able to get their
 
01:54:51.109 --> 01:54:51.119 align:start position:0%
thoughts on what we were doing so we
 
01:54:54.189 --> 01:54:54.199 align:start position:0%
gave them three weeks notice in July to
 
01:54:56.030 --> 01:54:56.040 align:start position:0%
say we're offering this conference in
 
01:55:00.229 --> 01:55:00.239 align:start position:0%
August and we had 30 teachers come um
 
01:55:02.229 --> 01:55:02.239 align:start position:0%
and that was the conference was free but
 
01:55:03.830 --> 01:55:03.840 align:start position:0%
they had no expectation of getting paid
 
01:55:05.030 --> 01:55:05.040 align:start position:0%
for that they were just passionate
 
01:55:06.510 --> 01:55:06.520 align:start position:0%
teachers interested in hearing about
 
01:55:08.589 --> 01:55:08.599 align:start position:0%
what the next thing was going to be so
 
01:55:12.709 --> 01:55:12.719 align:start position:0%
that was um 30 teachers and they
 
01:55:16.109 --> 01:55:16.119 align:start position:0%
represented um oh sorry 48 teachers
 
01:55:18.550 --> 01:55:18.560 align:start position:0%
representing 30 high schools so that's
 
01:55:20.550 --> 01:55:20.560 align:start position:0%
that was a significant number to CH to
 
01:55:23.790 --> 01:55:23.800 align:start position:0%
choose to attend we also continue to
 
01:55:25.790 --> 01:55:25.800 align:start position:0%
have monthly we call them Community
 
01:55:27.510 --> 01:55:27.520 align:start position:0%
conversations where we're just talking
 
01:55:29.350 --> 01:55:29.360 align:start position:0%
with teachers about the program allowing
 
01:55:30.950 --> 01:55:30.960 align:start position:0%
them opportunities to talk with each
 
01:55:32.950 --> 01:55:32.960 align:start position:0%
other about what's going on in their
 
01:55:35.030 --> 01:55:35.040 align:start position:0%
schools and what they need help with
 
01:55:37.270 --> 01:55:37.280 align:start position:0%
that helps to in us to inform us of
 
01:55:40.510 --> 01:55:40.520 align:start position:0%
what's going on we are we are starting
 
01:55:42.669 --> 01:55:42.679 align:start position:0%
to plan for this Summer's conference
 
01:55:45.350 --> 01:55:45.360 align:start position:0%
which will be only for teachers in the
 
01:55:48.310 --> 01:55:48.320 align:start position:0%
program and we already have 60 teachers
 
01:55:50.470 --> 01:55:50.480 align:start position:0%
signed up with the the schools that have
 
01:55:52.790 --> 01:55:52.800 align:start position:0%
signed their contracts
 
01:55:55.030 --> 01:55:55.040 align:start position:0%
we have told this the schools that are
 
01:55:57.109 --> 01:55:57.119 align:start position:0%
not going to start programs until fall
 
01:56:00.109 --> 01:56:00.119 align:start position:0%
of 26 that if they sign the memorandums
 
01:56:02.589 --> 01:56:02.599 align:start position:0%
before this they will also be invited to
 
01:56:04.910 --> 01:56:04.920 align:start position:0%
this conference um you know the more
 
01:56:07.229 --> 01:56:07.239 align:start position:0%
teachers we can expose to this type of
 
01:56:10.870 --> 01:56:10.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:12.990 --> 01:56:13.000 align:start position:0%
better representative
 
01:56:15.950 --> 01:56:15.960 align:start position:0%
Burton thank thank you Mr chairman thank
 
01:56:20.750 --> 01:56:20.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:24.470 --> 01:56:24.480 align:start position:0%
question excuse me um the accuplacer was
 
01:56:26.350 --> 01:56:26.360 align:start position:0%
required by federal law for quite a
 
01:56:28.589 --> 01:56:28.599 align:start position:0%
while to prove your students were
 
01:56:31.950 --> 01:56:31.960 align:start position:0%
eligible for Aid um and they used to
 
01:56:34.350 --> 01:56:34.360 align:start position:0%
show up in my office in June wanting to
 
01:56:36.709 --> 01:56:36.719 align:start position:0%
graduate but they hadn't done the math
 
01:56:40.270 --> 01:56:40.280 align:start position:0%
requirement um we went to a
 
01:56:43.910 --> 01:56:43.920 align:start position:0%
computer-based uh Learning System where
 
01:56:46.310 --> 01:56:46.320 align:start position:0%
a student only had to learn what they
 
01:56:49.030 --> 01:56:49.040 align:start position:0%
were deficient in and and we did away
 
01:56:51.669 --> 01:56:51.679 align:start position:0%
with classrooms and we had a math lab
 
01:56:54.430 --> 01:56:54.440 align:start position:0%
with three faculty members there so
 
01:56:57.910 --> 01:56:57.920 align:start position:0%
every student was on a different track
 
01:56:59.390 --> 01:56:59.400 align:start position:0%
depending because they'd get bored if
 
01:57:01.830 --> 01:57:01.840 align:start position:0%
they had to go back and take geometry if
 
01:57:02.990 --> 01:57:03.000 align:start position:0%
they already knew
 
01:57:06.390 --> 01:57:06.400 align:start position:0%
it um do you use that kind of software
 
01:57:09.229 --> 01:57:09.239 align:start position:0%
in this program to individualize the
 
01:57:11.149 --> 01:57:11.159 align:start position:0%
training for every
 
01:57:14.550 --> 01:57:14.560 align:start position:0%
student um we we don't in this program
 
01:57:16.510 --> 01:57:16.520 align:start position:0%
um they do in some of the community
 
01:57:19.790 --> 01:57:19.800 align:start position:0%
college courses however in this program
 
01:57:20.830 --> 01:57:20.840 align:start position:0%
because they're going to have the
 
01:57:22.709 --> 01:57:22.719 align:start position:0%
opportunity to take that dual enrollment
 
01:57:25.270 --> 01:57:25.280 align:start position:0%
statistics course um at in their second
 
01:57:27.390 --> 01:57:27.400 align:start position:0%
year many students are going to find
 
01:57:29.750 --> 01:57:29.760 align:start position:0%
that if they go on to college a lot of
 
01:57:31.790 --> 01:57:31.800 align:start position:0%
majors in college only require one Math
 
01:57:34.589 --> 01:57:34.599 align:start position:0%
course as to complete their program and
 
01:57:36.149 --> 01:57:36.159 align:start position:0%
so a lot of students who are in this
 
01:57:37.750 --> 01:57:37.760 align:start position:0%
program who do decide to go on to
 
01:57:40.149 --> 01:57:40.159 align:start position:0%
college in non- stem careers are going
 
01:57:41.910 --> 01:57:41.920 align:start position:0%
to find that they no longer will have to
 
01:57:43.750 --> 01:57:43.760 align:start position:0%
take a math course at at the college
 
01:57:45.109 --> 01:57:45.119 align:start position:0%
level because they'll have completed
 
01:57:47.030 --> 01:57:47.040 align:start position:0%
this college level course in high
 
01:57:49.629 --> 01:57:49.639 align:start position:0%
school just a quick followup I I know
 
01:57:51.669 --> 01:57:51.679 align:start position:0%
it's complicated because some Majors did
 
01:57:52.950 --> 01:57:52.960 align:start position:0%
not re
 
01:57:55.310 --> 01:57:55.320 align:start position:0%
the Proficiency in math that others did
 
01:57:57.310 --> 01:57:57.320 align:start position:0%
so it was a very
 
01:57:59.870 --> 01:57:59.880 align:start position:0%
individualistic uh
 
01:58:02.750 --> 01:58:02.760 align:start position:0%
process yeah it and it does it works
 
01:58:04.629 --> 01:58:04.639 align:start position:0%
very effectively at the college level
 
01:58:07.149 --> 01:58:07.159 align:start position:0%
high schools are not usually set up to
 
01:58:10.030 --> 01:58:10.040 align:start position:0%
have access to or or you know to
 
01:58:12.709 --> 01:58:12.719 align:start position:0%
purchase those um products which are
 
01:58:14.790 --> 01:58:14.800 align:start position:0%
often tied with the textbooks that the
 
01:58:18.270 --> 01:58:18.280 align:start position:0%
colleges are Contracting to purchase so
 
01:58:21.109 --> 01:58:21.119 align:start position:0%
um and at the high school level
 
01:58:22.709 --> 01:58:22.719 align:start position:0%
especially the types of students for
 
01:58:24.790 --> 01:58:24.800 align:start position:0%
this type of program that type of
 
01:58:26.750 --> 01:58:26.760 align:start position:0%
Independent Learning and independent
 
01:58:28.709 --> 01:58:28.719 align:start position:0%
testing is not necessarily something
 
01:58:30.910 --> 01:58:30.920 align:start position:0%
that they're
 
01:58:33.709 --> 01:58:33.719 align:start position:0%
um proficient in yet they haven't quite
 
01:58:35.310 --> 01:58:35.320 align:start position:0%
reached a maturity level that somebody
 
01:58:37.510 --> 01:58:37.520 align:start position:0%
who's going into a college might to be
 
01:58:39.510 --> 01:58:39.520 align:start position:0%
able to do that thank you very much
 
01:58:39.520 --> 01:58:40.550 align:start position:0%
able to do that thank you very much
thank

01:58:40.550 --> 01:58:40.560 align:start position:0%
thank
 
01:58:43.629 --> 01:58:43.639 align:start position:0%
you do we have any further questions
 
01:58:44.870 --> 01:58:44.880 align:start position:0%
okay well thank you to both our
 
01:58:48.790 --> 01:58:48.800 align:start position:0%
Witnesses I'm going to oh we do okay
 
01:58:51.109 --> 01:58:51.119 align:start position:0%
representative Earth uh thank you Mr
 
01:58:53.550 --> 01:58:53.560 align:start position:0%
chair and thank question getting back to
 
01:58:56.149 --> 01:58:56.159 align:start position:0%
the metrics uh discussion previously
 
01:58:58.189 --> 01:58:58.199 align:start position:0%
could you expound a little bit on what
 
01:59:01.589 --> 01:59:01.599 align:start position:0%
you described here as a summary of
 
01:59:03.510 --> 01:59:03.520 align:start position:0%
database student achievement and growth
 
01:59:05.270 --> 01:59:05.280 align:start position:0%
in terms of specific metrics that you
 
01:59:08.350 --> 01:59:08.360 align:start position:0%
would Envision reporting back to us sure
 
01:59:10.709 --> 01:59:10.719 align:start position:0%
so you know starting this fall when we
 
01:59:12.350 --> 01:59:12.360 align:start position:0%
launch for the first time at the end of
 
01:59:15.750 --> 01:59:15.760 align:start position:0%
August when Schools go back to um go
 
01:59:17.910 --> 01:59:17.920 align:start position:0%
back to session there is going to be an
 
01:59:20.030 --> 01:59:20.040 align:start position:0%
initial assessment of some sort uh
 
01:59:21.270 --> 01:59:21.280 align:start position:0%
actually there will be multiple
 
01:59:24.270 --> 01:59:24.280 align:start position:0%
assessments um as we go into this so one
 
01:59:27.189 --> 01:59:27.199 align:start position:0%
might be um more of a test based type
 
01:59:28.669 --> 01:59:28.679 align:start position:0%
assessment but then we'll also be
 
01:59:30.790 --> 01:59:30.800 align:start position:0%
looking back at data from student school
 
01:59:34.109 --> 01:59:34.119 align:start position:0%
records previous scores of classes um
 
01:59:36.990 --> 01:59:37.000 align:start position:0%
previous levels that they've taken Etc
 
01:59:40.069 --> 01:59:40.079 align:start position:0%
and then as we go on through the program
 
01:59:42.790 --> 01:59:42.800 align:start position:0%
um there will be one thing that we're
 
01:59:44.589 --> 01:59:44.599 align:start position:0%
doing this time that's different from
 
01:59:47.510 --> 01:59:47.520 align:start position:0%
last time too is we are the curriculum
 
01:59:49.149 --> 01:59:49.159 align:start position:0%
that we're using is much more
 
01:59:51.709 --> 01:59:51.719 align:start position:0%
standardized the teachers regardless of
 
01:59:53.350 --> 01:59:53.360 align:start position:0%
which high school they're in will be
 
01:59:56.350 --> 01:59:56.360 align:start position:0%
using the same um it's called an open
 
01:59:58.229 --> 01:59:58.239 align:start position:0%
educational resource it's an online
 
02:00:00.470 --> 02:00:00.480 align:start position:0%
textbook they'll be using those same
 
02:00:02.109 --> 02:00:02.119 align:start position:0%
textbooks they'll have access to the
 
02:00:05.629 --> 02:00:05.639 align:start position:0%
same projects Etc and as part of this
 
02:00:07.350 --> 02:00:07.360 align:start position:0%
program what we'll be doing from a
 
02:00:10.069 --> 02:00:10.079 align:start position:0%
program assessment perspective is
 
02:00:12.069 --> 02:00:12.079 align:start position:0%
filtering in through their standard
 
02:00:14.629 --> 02:00:14.639 align:start position:0%
assessments for their High School grades
 
02:00:16.910 --> 02:00:16.920 align:start position:0%
specific questions designed to assess
 
02:00:18.470 --> 02:00:18.480 align:start position:0%
whether the program is actually
 
02:00:21.310 --> 02:00:21.320 align:start position:0%
succeeding in in helping students Master
 
02:00:23.149 --> 02:00:23.159 align:start position:0%
the the learning objectives that we've
 
02:00:26.550 --> 02:00:26.560 align:start position:0%
defined so rather than just a a solid
 
02:00:28.350 --> 02:00:28.360 align:start position:0%
test at the beginning solid test at the
 
02:00:29.709 --> 02:00:29.719 align:start position:0%
end and let's see what the difference is
 
02:00:31.870 --> 02:00:31.880 align:start position:0%
going to be we're going to be assessing
 
02:00:34.870 --> 02:00:34.880 align:start position:0%
throughout the process um to be able to
 
02:00:36.910 --> 02:00:36.920 align:start position:0%
make whatever changes we need to as we
 
02:00:40.310 --> 02:00:40.320 align:start position:0%
go as well as to give the students the
 
02:00:42.669 --> 02:00:42.679 align:start position:0%
best opportunity possible to demonstrate
 
02:00:45.030 --> 02:00:45.040 align:start position:0%
what they understand um that's really
 
02:00:47.229 --> 02:00:47.239 align:start position:0%
important rather than doing a unitby
 
02:00:50.270 --> 02:00:50.280 align:start position:0%
unit assessment some students may not
 
02:00:51.950 --> 02:00:51.960 align:start position:0%
have mastered something at the end of t
 
02:00:54.709 --> 02:00:54.719 align:start position:0%
test one but by the end of test two even
 
02:00:57.270 --> 02:00:57.280 align:start position:0%
though a topic was from a previous unit
 
02:00:59.709 --> 02:00:59.719 align:start position:0%
that was something that was necessary to
 
02:01:01.430 --> 02:01:01.440 align:start position:0%
understand the second unit and now
 
02:01:03.950 --> 02:01:03.960 align:start position:0%
they've mastered that um that's really
 
02:01:05.950 --> 02:01:05.960 align:start position:0%
kind of how learning takes place in with
 
02:01:08.270 --> 02:01:08.280 align:start position:0%
people not just here's a chunk this is
 
02:01:10.629 --> 02:01:10.639 align:start position:0%
your one chance to show you learned it
 
02:01:13.030 --> 02:01:13.040 align:start position:0%
now here's another chance but it's for a
 
02:01:14.790 --> 02:01:14.800 align:start position:0%
different Chunk we can't go back and see
 
02:01:17.390 --> 02:01:17.400 align:start position:0%
that you've Advanced your
 
02:01:23.149 --> 02:01:23.159 align:start position:0%
knowledge does that help thank you
 
02:01:25.990 --> 02:01:26.000 align:start position:0%
all right thank you very much and uh
 
02:01:28.270 --> 02:01:28.280 align:start position:0%
with that I'm going to close the hearing
 
02:01:56.709 --> 02:01:56.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:58.589 --> 02:01:58.599 align:start position:0%
okay I I see we have the university
 
02:02:00.950 --> 02:02:00.960 align:start position:0%
system here as well for the next one so
 
02:02:03.830 --> 02:02:03.840 align:start position:0%
let's uh get on to it uh the next bill
 
02:02:05.189 --> 02:02:05.199 align:start position:0%
is HP
 
02:02:07.510 --> 02:02:07.520 align:start position:0%
510 uh that's a bill which is going to
 
02:02:10.910 --> 02:02:10.920 align:start position:0%

uh my name is Bob Lynn I'm a
 
02:02:43.350 --> 02:02:43.360 align:start position:0%
representative from Rockingham District

appear here in support of this bill um
 
02:02:53.189 --> 02:02:53.199 align:start position:0%
for those of you who uh are not freshman
 
02:02:55.270 --> 02:02:55.280 align:start position:0%
uh you may recall that this bill passed
 
02:02:58.790 --> 02:02:58.800 align:start position:0%
the house last year uh but died in the
 
02:03:02.669 --> 02:03:02.679 align:start position:0%
Senate U from speaking with uh one of
 
02:03:05.950 --> 02:03:05.960 align:start position:0%
the Senators who uh was was uh heavily
 
02:03:08.510 --> 02:03:08.520 align:start position:0%
involved with this bill in the Senate my
 
02:03:10.990 --> 02:03:11.000 align:start position:0%
understanding was uh that there were two
 
02:03:14.310 --> 02:03:14.320 align:start position:0%
issues that particularly troubled U the
 
02:03:18.550 --> 02:03:18.560 align:start position:0%
Senate um one is you may recall that
 
02:03:21.189 --> 02:03:21.199 align:start position:0%
there was language in last year's bill
 
02:03:23.629 --> 02:03:23.639 align:start position:0%
which I've specifically have taken out
 
02:03:28.669 --> 02:03:28.679 align:start position:0%
of this year's Bill uh to the effect uh
 
02:03:31.030 --> 02:03:31.040 align:start position:0%
that I I can't quote the language
 
02:03:33.310 --> 02:03:33.320 align:start position:0%
exactly but it basically said that if
 
02:03:36.109 --> 02:03:36.119 align:start position:0%
there is a criminal
 
02:03:40.510 --> 02:03:40.520 align:start position:0%
proceeding that uh is instituted against
 
02:03:45.430 --> 02:03:45.440 align:start position:0%
a student or a faculty member um the the
 
02:03:48.430 --> 02:03:48.440 align:start position:0%
the process of internal discipline which
 
02:03:50.990 --> 02:03:51.000 align:start position:0%
this bill deals with would be held in
 
02:03:53.229 --> 02:03:53.239 align:start position:0%
abeyance until the criminal proceeding
 
02:03:55.310 --> 02:03:55.320 align:start position:0%
was over I should indicate that that was
 
02:03:57.510 --> 02:03:57.520 align:start position:0%
not something that was in my the
 
02:03:58.950 --> 02:03:58.960 align:start position:0%
original draft of the bill that I
 
02:04:01.310 --> 02:04:01.320 align:start position:0%
presented last time but it was the
 
02:04:02.990 --> 02:04:03.000 align:start position:0%
education committee at the time that
 
02:04:05.750 --> 02:04:05.760 align:start position:0%
added that um and you know I said I
 
02:04:08.470 --> 02:04:08.480 align:start position:0%
could live with it I didn't uh I didn't
 
02:04:10.109 --> 02:04:10.119 align:start position:0%
particularly think it was absolutely
 
02:04:11.990 --> 02:04:12.000 align:start position:0%
important but the committee did and that
 
02:04:13.669 --> 02:04:13.679 align:start position:0%
was one of the things that the that the
 
02:04:16.830 --> 02:04:16.840 align:start position:0%
uh the U Senate apparently was was
 
02:04:20.629 --> 02:04:20.639 align:start position:0%
concerned about um that that could mean
 
02:04:23.149 --> 02:04:23.159 align:start position:0%
that intern disciplinary proceedings at
 
02:04:24.990 --> 02:04:25.000 align:start position:0%
the University or the community college
 
02:04:27.549 --> 02:04:27.559 align:start position:0%
system would have could have to be hel
 
02:04:29.069 --> 02:04:29.079 align:start position:0%
you know held in OB bance for a very
 
02:04:31.790 --> 02:04:31.800 align:start position:0%
long period of time if a criminal case
 
02:04:33.310 --> 02:04:33.320 align:start position:0%
uh got delayed for some reason or other
 
02:04:34.629 --> 02:04:34.639 align:start position:0%
and that I think that was a legitimate
 
02:04:37.350 --> 02:04:37.360 align:start position:0%
point I took that out in this bill the
 
02:04:39.109 --> 02:04:39.119 align:start position:0%
other uh thing and perhaps even more
 
02:04:40.990 --> 02:04:41.000 align:start position:0%
substantial that I understood the senate
 
02:04:43.270 --> 02:04:43.280 align:start position:0%
had a question about or trouble with
 
02:04:46.510 --> 02:04:46.520 align:start position:0%
last year was
 
02:04:49.589 --> 02:04:49.599 align:start position:0%
um dealing particularly with with the
 
02:04:51.790 --> 02:04:51.800 align:start position:0%
application of this bill to faculty me
 
02:04:54.109 --> 02:04:54.119 align:start position:0%
members um the argument was as I
 
02:04:55.669 --> 02:04:55.679 align:start position:0%
understood it well we have collective
 
02:04:57.910 --> 02:04:57.920 align:start position:0%
bargaining agreements in effect with
 
02:05:00.790 --> 02:05:00.800 align:start position:0%
many faculty with many uh faculty
 
02:05:02.790 --> 02:05:02.800 align:start position:0%
members who are represented by unions
 
02:05:06.270 --> 02:05:06.280 align:start position:0%
and this bill is inconsistent with that
 
02:05:08.910 --> 02:05:08.920 align:start position:0%
and it'll cause all kinds of collective
 
02:05:11.910 --> 02:05:11.920 align:start position:0%
bargaining uh agreement problems
 
02:05:14.870 --> 02:05:14.880 align:start position:0%
um let's accept I'm not sure that I
 
02:05:16.350 --> 02:05:16.360 align:start position:0%
actually believe that that was true but
 
02:05:19.470 --> 02:05:19.480 align:start position:0%
let's accept that that was true um I in
 
02:05:21.790 --> 02:05:21.800 align:start position:0%
ever in an effort to alleviate that
 
02:05:25.629 --> 02:05:25.639 align:start position:0%
issue I you'll notice that in this bill
 
02:05:29.750 --> 02:05:29.760 align:start position:0%
in uh what is proposed as RSA 188 K5 it
 
02:05:32.189 --> 02:05:32.199 align:start position:0%
has specific language that says if
 
02:05:34.030 --> 02:05:34.040 align:start position:0%
there's an existing collective
 
02:05:37.549 --> 02:05:37.559 align:start position:0%
bargaining agreement that's in effect um
 
02:05:40.350 --> 02:05:40.360 align:start position:0%
that you know covers uh these kind of
 
02:05:42.510 --> 02:05:42.520 align:start position:0%
proceedings then you can continue to use
 
02:05:45.950 --> 02:05:45.960 align:start position:0%
that process um until that collective
 
02:05:49.870 --> 02:05:49.880 align:start position:0%
bargaining agreement expires you can't
 
02:05:52.629 --> 02:05:52.639 align:start position:0%
extend the the the collective bargaining
 
02:05:55.189 --> 02:05:55.199 align:start position:0%
agreement as to this subject matter uh
 
02:05:57.270 --> 02:05:57.280 align:start position:0%
and you can't have a new one that's
 
02:05:59.189 --> 02:05:59.199 align:start position:0%
inconsistent with this but if there's an
 
02:06:02.270 --> 02:06:02.280 align:start position:0%
existing one that's in effect fine let's
 
02:06:06.149 --> 02:06:06.159 align:start position:0%
uh you can do that I hope what what the
 
02:06:10.069 --> 02:06:10.079 align:start position:0%
the important point that I want to make
 
02:06:12.149 --> 02:06:12.159 align:start position:0%
on this and I'm trying to anticipate
 
02:06:14.589 --> 02:06:14.599 align:start position:0%
what I suspect some of the objections to
 
02:06:18.109 --> 02:06:18.119 align:start position:0%
this may be from some later witnesses as
 
02:06:21.229 --> 02:06:21.239 align:start position:0%
you consider this bill I hope that the
 
02:06:23.790 --> 02:06:23.800 align:start position:0%
first first thing that you will ask
 
02:06:28.149 --> 02:06:28.159 align:start position:0%
yourself is to look at section K3 on
 
02:06:28.159 --> 02:06:28.990 align:start position:0%
yourself is to look at section K3 on
page

02:06:28.990 --> 02:06:29.000 align:start position:0%
page
 
02:06:32.069 --> 02:06:32.079 align:start position:0%
two and go through the
 
02:06:36.870 --> 02:06:36.880 align:start position:0%
rights in subsections 1 a through J and
 
02:06:38.750 --> 02:06:38.760 align:start position:0%
as you look at those I hope that you
 
02:06:41.189 --> 02:06:41.199 align:start position:0%
will ask yourself which one of these
 
02:06:45.149 --> 02:06:45.159 align:start position:0%
rights do I think we shouldn't have
 
02:06:47.950 --> 02:06:47.960 align:start position:0%
which one of these rights is unfair is
 
02:06:51.830 --> 02:06:51.840 align:start position:0%
is uh is is something that uh some who
 
02:06:53.470 --> 02:06:53.480 align:start position:0%
is Accu whether it's a faculty member or
 
02:06:55.069 --> 02:06:55.079 align:start position:0%
student who's accused of something for
 
02:06:57.109 --> 02:06:57.119 align:start position:0%
which they could be suspended remember
 
02:06:59.430 --> 02:06:59.440 align:start position:0%
this doesn't apply I should also note
 
02:07:02.629 --> 02:07:02.639 align:start position:0%
that at one point the this this uh Bill
 
02:07:04.790 --> 02:07:04.800 align:start position:0%
had talked about it covering simple
 
02:07:06.629 --> 02:07:06.639 align:start position:0%
reprimands and there was I think a
 
02:07:08.669 --> 02:07:08.679 align:start position:0%
legitimate objection last year that that
 
02:07:12.270 --> 02:07:12.280 align:start position:0%
was too that was too that went too far
 
02:07:13.629 --> 02:07:13.639 align:start position:0%
it should have to be at least
 
02:07:15.910 --> 02:07:15.920 align:start position:0%
suspensions or expulsions and that's the
 
02:07:17.790 --> 02:07:17.800 align:start position:0%
way the spill is now worded it applies
 
02:07:20.870 --> 02:07:20.880 align:start position:0%
only to something that is serious enough
 
02:07:23.470 --> 02:07:23.480 align:start position:0%
that a student would be suspended or
 
02:07:27.069 --> 02:07:27.079 align:start position:0%
expelled but if you have that situation
 
02:07:30.589 --> 02:07:30.599 align:start position:0%
which of the rights in the that are that
 
02:07:33.430 --> 02:07:33.440 align:start position:0%
are created by this bill should should a
 
02:07:36.510 --> 02:07:36.520 align:start position:0%
student not have which one is too
 
02:07:39.750 --> 02:07:39.760 align:start position:0%
much and I submit to you that none of
 
02:07:42.870 --> 02:07:42.880 align:start position:0%
them are that they are all sort of basic
 
02:07:45.669 --> 02:07:45.679 align:start position:0%
fundamental rights that anyone who is
 
02:07:47.189 --> 02:07:47.199 align:start position:0%
accused of something for which they
 
02:07:49.990 --> 02:07:50.000 align:start position:0%
could be suspended or removed from
 
02:07:52.629 --> 02:07:52.639 align:start position:0%
school should have
 
02:07:54.790 --> 02:07:54.800 align:start position:0%
and you know there was a there's a
 
02:07:57.310 --> 02:07:57.320 align:start position:0%
question so you may ask yourself well
 
02:07:58.830 --> 02:07:58.840 align:start position:0%
why do we need
 
02:08:01.629 --> 02:08:01.639 align:start position:0%
this well one of the reasons we need
 
02:08:03.510 --> 02:08:03.520 align:start position:0%
this and I I think you know this is hard
 
02:08:05.270 --> 02:08:05.280 align:start position:0%
frankly for me to imagine but it's
 
02:08:05.280 --> 02:08:06.589 align:start position:0%
frankly for me to imagine but it's
absolutely

02:08:06.589 --> 02:08:06.599 align:start position:0%
absolutely
 
02:08:10.430 --> 02:08:10.440 align:start position:0%
true in the Obama
 
02:08:12.990 --> 02:08:13.000 align:start position:0%
Administration and then it was reversed
 
02:08:14.510 --> 02:08:14.520 align:start position:0%
by the Trump admin first Trump
 
02:08:17.030 --> 02:08:17.040 align:start position:0%
Administration but rein reinstituted or
 
02:08:19.750 --> 02:08:19.760 align:start position:0%
at least tried to be reinstituted um in
 
02:08:22.229 --> 02:08:22.239 align:start position:0%
the last Administration the Biden admin
 
02:08:25.870 --> 02:08:25.880 align:start position:0%
ation the message was sent out in the
 
02:08:28.470 --> 02:08:28.480 align:start position:0%
form of either regulations or quote
 
02:08:31.310 --> 02:08:31.320 align:start position:0%
unquote guidance which uh was done in an
 
02:08:35.629 --> 02:08:35.639 align:start position:0%
effort to uh avoid the idea of having a
 
02:08:37.790 --> 02:08:37.800 align:start position:0%
formal regulation that might be
 
02:08:41.189 --> 02:08:41.199 align:start position:0%
challenged that you you shouldn't give
 
02:08:43.790 --> 02:08:43.800 align:start position:0%
students these rights you you you
 
02:08:46.189 --> 02:08:46.199 align:start position:0%
schools universities you shouldn't be
 
02:08:50.510 --> 02:08:50.520 align:start position:0%
too Fair it's okay to to throw somebody
 
02:08:54.030 --> 02:08:54.040 align:start position:0%
out on you know less than a fair process
 
02:08:56.549 --> 02:08:56.559 align:start position:0%
imagine that imagine the government
 
02:08:59.750 --> 02:08:59.760 align:start position:0%
saying that that's that's that you
 
02:09:01.910 --> 02:09:01.920 align:start position:0%
should do that and then if by the way if
 
02:09:04.189 --> 02:09:04.199 align:start position:0%
you don't do that you are at least at
 
02:09:07.229 --> 02:09:07.239 align:start position:0%
risk of losing Federal funding I me can
 
02:09:10.310 --> 02:09:10.320 align:start position:0%
you just imagine that don't be too fair
 
02:09:12.510 --> 02:09:12.520 align:start position:0%
to students that are accused of of of
 
02:09:14.950 --> 02:09:14.960 align:start position:0%
wrongdoing or you might risk Federal
 
02:09:18.310 --> 02:09:18.320 align:start position:0%
funding as a result of as a result of
 
02:09:21.870 --> 02:09:21.880 align:start position:0%
this that's why a number of states and I
 
02:09:24.069 --> 02:09:24.079 align:start position:0%
think an increasing number have adopted
 
02:09:28.109 --> 02:09:28.119 align:start position:0%
legislation like this now one of the
 
02:09:30.189 --> 02:09:30.199 align:start position:0%
things that I suspect you will
 
02:09:32.629 --> 02:09:32.639 align:start position:0%
hear from some of the other people
 
02:09:35.229 --> 02:09:35.239 align:start position:0%
that'll testify here are everything's
 
02:09:38.350 --> 02:09:38.360 align:start position:0%
working fine there's no problem in our
 
02:09:40.030 --> 02:09:40.040 align:start position:0%
in you know with the disciplinary
 
02:09:42.109 --> 02:09:42.119 align:start position:0%
process we have in place
 
02:09:44.990 --> 02:09:45.000 align:start position:0%
now so I would ask you again as you
 
02:09:48.990 --> 02:09:49.000 align:start position:0%
analyze that question then ask
 
02:09:51.589 --> 02:09:51.599 align:start position:0%
yourself which of the rights that I said
 
02:09:54.750 --> 02:09:54.760 align:start position:0%
before that this bill gives is is not
 
02:09:57.750 --> 02:09:57.760 align:start position:0%
important so that if they say their
 
02:10:00.229 --> 02:10:00.239 align:start position:0%
disciplinary system is working just
 
02:10:04.149 --> 02:10:04.159 align:start position:0%
fine does it have all of these rights or
 
02:10:05.470 --> 02:10:05.480 align:start position:0%
doesn't it one of the things that I
 
02:10:06.750 --> 02:10:06.760 align:start position:0%
never heard and I don't know whether
 
02:10:08.470 --> 02:10:08.480 align:start position:0%
this whether the Senate heard this or
 
02:10:10.589 --> 02:10:10.599 align:start position:0%
not or maybe the your your committee did
 
02:10:12.709 --> 02:10:12.719 align:start position:0%
but one of the things I never heard was
 
02:10:14.109 --> 02:10:14.119 align:start position:0%
I heard I heard the statement we have
 
02:10:15.910 --> 02:10:15.920 align:start position:0%
disciplinary procedures in in place and
 
02:10:17.870 --> 02:10:17.880 align:start position:0%
they're fine they you know they they're
 
02:10:20.790 --> 02:10:20.800 align:start position:0%
fair and all this and that I never heard
 
02:10:21.870 --> 02:10:21.880 align:start position:0%
and I don't know know whether this
 
02:10:24.109 --> 02:10:24.119 align:start position:0%
committee ever received the details of
 
02:10:26.270 --> 02:10:26.280 align:start position:0%
exactly what are their disciplinary
 
02:10:30.069 --> 02:10:30.079 align:start position:0%
procedures and how do they differ from
 
02:10:32.310 --> 02:10:32.320 align:start position:0%
this and one of the things that I think
 
02:10:34.669 --> 02:10:34.679 align:start position:0%
you ought to really be care be very much
 
02:10:38.430 --> 02:10:38.440 align:start position:0%
asking yourself is you'll notice the
 
02:10:40.549 --> 02:10:40.559 align:start position:0%
fiscal note on this bill talks about you
 
02:10:42.470 --> 02:10:42.480 align:start position:0%
know five maybe it's going to be
 
02:10:46.189 --> 02:10:46.199 align:start position:0%
$500,000 or something to uh they need
 
02:10:49.790 --> 02:10:49.800 align:start position:0%
three more people to implement this um
 
02:10:51.950 --> 02:10:51.960 align:start position:0%
and I have to say if
 
02:10:54.430 --> 02:10:54.440 align:start position:0%
you know it seems to me you can't have
 
02:10:57.549 --> 02:10:57.559 align:start position:0%
it both ways you can't say that look our
 
02:11:00.310 --> 02:11:00.320 align:start position:0%
procedures are just fine and they're
 
02:11:02.990 --> 02:11:03.000 align:start position:0%
very fair and there's and there's you
 
02:11:04.910 --> 02:11:04.920 align:start position:0%
know there's really no problem here on
 
02:11:06.990 --> 02:11:07.000 align:start position:0%
the one hand but on the other hand if
 
02:11:09.790 --> 02:11:09.800 align:start position:0%
you want to implement these
 
02:11:12.069 --> 02:11:12.079 align:start position:0%
procedures and again if you think that
 
02:11:14.790 --> 02:11:14.800 align:start position:0%
some of the procedures are too fair I
 
02:11:16.510 --> 02:11:16.520 align:start position:0%
guess that's you know that's for you but
 
02:11:17.910 --> 02:11:17.920 align:start position:0%
if you want to implement these
 
02:11:20.510 --> 02:11:20.520 align:start position:0%
procedures it's going to cost this much
 
02:11:23.750 --> 02:11:23.760 align:start position:0%
more if that's true I submit that that
 
02:11:25.709 --> 02:11:25.719 align:start position:0%
suggests that their procedures are
 
02:11:28.589 --> 02:11:28.599 align:start position:0%
really very different the existing
 
02:11:31.149 --> 02:11:31.159 align:start position:0%
procedures are really very different
 
02:11:33.350 --> 02:11:33.360 align:start position:0%
from the procedures established by this
 
02:11:35.750 --> 02:11:35.760 align:start position:0%
bill um and that's why it's going to
 
02:11:37.629 --> 02:11:37.639 align:start position:0%
cost so much money and if they are
 
02:11:41.149 --> 02:11:41.159 align:start position:0%
really that different ask yourself what
 
02:11:44.589 --> 02:11:44.599 align:start position:0%
are you know what what are those
 
02:11:47.549 --> 02:11:47.559 align:start position:0%
procedures um one of the things that you
 
02:11:49.950 --> 02:11:49.960 align:start position:0%
that you I I remember being said last
 
02:11:53.910 --> 02:11:53.920 align:start position:0%
year was um well what are the complaints
 
02:11:55.069 --> 02:11:55.079 align:start position:0%
you know do you have do you have
 
02:11:57.709 --> 02:11:57.719 align:start position:0%
evidence can you say you know here's the
 
02:12:00.510 --> 02:12:00.520 align:start position:0%
evidence of all the proceed of all the
 
02:12:02.430 --> 02:12:02.440 align:start position:0%
students that were treated unfairly and
 
02:12:04.350 --> 02:12:04.360 align:start position:0%
I and I had to say I have I have gotten
 
02:12:06.589 --> 02:12:06.599 align:start position:0%
one or two you know sort of anecdotal
 
02:12:09.910 --> 02:12:09.920 align:start position:0%
things about about people that that uh
 
02:12:11.270 --> 02:12:11.280 align:start position:0%
felt they were treated unfairly or
 
02:12:12.589 --> 02:12:12.599 align:start position:0%
parents that felt that students were
 
02:12:14.830 --> 02:12:14.840 align:start position:0%
treated unfairly but you know candidly
 
02:12:17.589 --> 02:12:17.599 align:start position:0%
it's I I I'm not in a position to
 
02:12:18.950 --> 02:12:18.960 align:start position:0%
investigate those I don't know whether
 
02:12:20.510 --> 02:12:20.520 align:start position:0%
those are true or not or whether they're
 
02:12:22.109 --> 02:12:22.119 align:start position:0%
you know there somebody's complaining
 
02:12:24.830 --> 02:12:24.840 align:start position:0%
because that they were they had they had
 
02:12:26.910 --> 02:12:26.920 align:start position:0%
a fair procedure and they just didn't
 
02:12:28.270 --> 02:12:28.280 align:start position:0%
they were they came out on the losing
 
02:12:30.350 --> 02:12:30.360 align:start position:0%
end of it I don't know the answer to
 
02:12:32.709 --> 02:12:32.719 align:start position:0%
that but one of the things that I that I
 
02:12:35.310 --> 02:12:35.320 align:start position:0%
I think is very important that this
 
02:12:37.870 --> 02:12:37.880 align:start position:0%
committee consider an analyzing that
 
02:12:41.350 --> 02:12:41.360 align:start position:0%
issue is some of
 
02:12:43.910 --> 02:12:43.920 align:start position:0%
these stop and think about the the
 
02:12:47.069 --> 02:12:47.079 align:start position:0%
motivation somebody has even if they
 
02:12:49.589 --> 02:12:49.599 align:start position:0%
felt that they were treated unfairly not
 
02:12:53.390 --> 02:12:53.400 align:start position:0%
to come forward for example suppose you
 
02:12:55.950 --> 02:12:55.960 align:start position:0%
are somebody that um was accused of
 
02:12:57.990 --> 02:12:58.000 align:start position:0%
let's say a sexual assault of another
 
02:13:02.390 --> 02:13:02.400 align:start position:0%
student and there's some procedure um
 
02:13:03.790 --> 02:13:03.800 align:start position:0%
and you don't think that you were
 
02:13:05.390 --> 02:13:05.400 align:start position:0%
treated fairly and you think that there
 
02:13:08.629 --> 02:13:08.639 align:start position:0%
was some some result that was uh that
 
02:13:11.990 --> 02:13:12.000 align:start position:0%
was not you know not fair to you well
 
02:13:13.629 --> 02:13:13.639 align:start position:0%
you might say you know maybe you're
 
02:13:14.990 --> 02:13:15.000 align:start position:0%
maybe you're brave enough to come
 
02:13:17.270 --> 02:13:17.280 align:start position:0%
forward and say I'm you know I I protest
 
02:13:21.229 --> 02:13:21.239 align:start position:0%
this or maybe you think geez you know uh
 
02:13:23.510 --> 02:13:23.520 align:start position:0%
um I don't want to I don't want to you
 
02:13:25.669 --> 02:13:25.679 align:start position:0%
know sort of go public with with this
 
02:13:27.310 --> 02:13:27.320 align:start position:0%
with this problem even though I do feel
 
02:13:29.390 --> 02:13:29.400 align:start position:0%
that I that I was treated unfairly so I
 
02:13:31.030 --> 02:13:31.040 align:start position:0%
guess what I'm saying is I'm not sure
 
02:13:34.910 --> 02:13:34.920 align:start position:0%
that public complaints are something
 
02:13:37.549 --> 02:13:37.559 align:start position:0%
that um is should be the be all and end
 
02:13:41.270 --> 02:13:41.280 align:start position:0%
all again what I would go back to
 
02:13:44.430 --> 02:13:44.440 align:start position:0%
is do you think that the procedures that
 
02:13:48.229 --> 02:13:48.239 align:start position:0%
are outlined here are unfair or are
 
02:13:48.239 --> 02:13:49.430 align:start position:0%
are outlined here are unfair or are
unduly

02:13:49.430 --> 02:13:49.440 align:start position:0%
unduly
 
02:13:52.109 --> 02:13:52.119 align:start position:0%
burdensome um to to you know to
 
02:13:55.950 --> 02:13:55.960 align:start position:0%
basically give students the the kind of
 
02:13:58.270 --> 02:13:58.280 align:start position:0%
basic due process rights notice an
 
02:14:00.629 --> 02:14:00.639 align:start position:0%
opportunity to be heard a fair decision
 
02:14:04.430 --> 02:14:04.440 align:start position:0%
maker um uh those kind of things this
 
02:14:06.189 --> 02:14:06.199 align:start position:0%
this doesn't turn this in any way into a
 
02:14:07.950 --> 02:14:07.960 align:start position:0%
criminal trial the burden of proof is
 
02:14:09.870 --> 02:14:09.880 align:start position:0%
the burden of proof that would apply in
 
02:14:13.470 --> 02:14:13.480 align:start position:0%
any civil proceeding um I included
 
02:14:15.270 --> 02:14:15.280 align:start position:0%
you'll notice I included a provision
 
02:14:18.270 --> 02:14:18.280 align:start position:0%
although there's a a presumption of of
 
02:14:20.189 --> 02:14:20.199 align:start position:0%
Innocence which I think is should should
 
02:14:22.830 --> 02:14:22.840 align:start position:0%
apply in any proceeding like this there
 
02:14:26.109 --> 02:14:26.119 align:start position:0%
is a provision that says that you
 
02:14:30.430 --> 02:14:30.440 align:start position:0%
can an accused person can invoke their
 
02:14:32.549 --> 02:14:32.559 align:start position:0%
right not to testify in their own
 
02:14:34.069 --> 02:14:34.079 align:start position:0%
defense if they want to that you know
 
02:14:35.629 --> 02:14:35.639 align:start position:0%
the what would be considered the right
 
02:14:37.229 --> 02:14:37.239 align:start position:0%
against self-incrimination but because
 
02:14:39.870 --> 02:14:39.880 align:start position:0%
these are civil proceedings generally
 
02:14:42.750 --> 02:14:42.760 align:start position:0%
the law in civil proceedings is that yes
 
02:14:44.549 --> 02:14:44.559 align:start position:0%
you can invoke your
 
02:14:47.229 --> 02:14:47.239 align:start position:0%
right U against self-incrimination but
 
02:14:49.510 --> 02:14:49.520 align:start position:0%
in a civil proceeding the FactFinder may
 
02:14:51.830 --> 02:14:51.840 align:start position:0%
take that may draw an inference from the
 
02:14:54.069 --> 02:14:54.079 align:start position:0%
fact that you've invoked your right to
 
02:14:57.709 --> 02:14:57.719 align:start position:0%
um to uh not to test invoke May invoke
 
02:15:00.390 --> 02:15:00.400 align:start position:0%
an inference against you and so I've you
 
02:15:02.950 --> 02:15:02.960 align:start position:0%
know I've had that had that in here in
 
02:15:06.870 --> 02:15:06.880 align:start position:0%
summary I really I believe first of all
 
02:15:10.069 --> 02:15:10.079 align:start position:0%
that I'm very skeptical about the cost
 
02:15:11.189 --> 02:15:11.199 align:start position:0%
estimates here and I know that's
 
02:15:12.790 --> 02:15:12.800 align:start position:0%
something that finance will look for if
 
02:15:14.709 --> 02:15:14.719 align:start position:0%
this committee passes the bill but I'm
 
02:15:17.470 --> 02:15:17.480 align:start position:0%
very skeptical about that in the first
 
02:15:20.790 --> 02:15:20.800 align:start position:0%
place but secondly if it's really true
 
02:15:22.830 --> 02:15:22.840 align:start position:0%
if it really is true that they need you
 
02:15:25.270 --> 02:15:25.280 align:start position:0%
know that they need to hire all these
 
02:15:28.270 --> 02:15:28.280 align:start position:0%
additional people to implement what are
 
02:15:30.229 --> 02:15:30.239 align:start position:0%
basically Fair
 
02:15:32.310 --> 02:15:32.320 align:start position:0%
procedures that should be of a great
 
02:15:34.350 --> 02:15:34.360 align:start position:0%
concern to this committee about exactly
 
02:15:36.350 --> 02:15:36.360 align:start position:0%
what are the procedures that are
 
02:15:39.870 --> 02:15:39.880 align:start position:0%
happening now and and also bear in mind
 
02:15:42.709 --> 02:15:42.719 align:start position:0%
that this bill specifically says that
 
02:15:44.950 --> 02:15:44.960 align:start position:0%
students or faculty members whoever the
 
02:15:48.350 --> 02:15:48.360 align:start position:0%
accused is is free to wave the pro the
 
02:15:50.589 --> 02:15:50.599 align:start position:0%
protections of this bill as long as they
 
02:15:52.589 --> 02:15:52.599 align:start position:0%
do so knowingly and voluntarily so if
 
02:15:55.669 --> 02:15:55.679 align:start position:0%
the you know if the procedures are they
 
02:15:58.990 --> 02:15:59.000 align:start position:0%
have in place and I hope you'll ask ask
 
02:16:01.709 --> 02:16:01.719 align:start position:0%
them to specify in detail what those
 
02:16:03.669 --> 02:16:03.679 align:start position:0%
procedures are but if the procedures
 
02:16:05.270 --> 02:16:05.280 align:start position:0%
they have in place really are basically
 
02:16:08.069 --> 02:16:08.079 align:start position:0%
Fair procedures I wouldn't students wave
 
02:16:11.030 --> 02:16:11.040 align:start position:0%
them why wouldn't they say fine I
 
02:16:14.030 --> 02:16:14.040 align:start position:0%
suggest to you that that the the reason
 
02:16:15.790 --> 02:16:15.800 align:start position:0%
that you know the logical reason why
 
02:16:17.510 --> 02:16:17.520 align:start position:0%
they wouldn't want to wave them because
 
02:16:19.350 --> 02:16:19.360 align:start position:0%
this will this will you know if a
 
02:16:20.589 --> 02:16:20.599 align:start position:0%
student really wants to insist on
 
02:16:22.990 --> 02:16:23.000 align:start position:0%
everything that's in here they'll they
 
02:16:25.149 --> 02:16:25.159 align:start position:0%
have a right to an advisor uh or an
 
02:16:26.830 --> 02:16:26.840 align:start position:0%
attorney but they don't get the attorney
 
02:16:31.030 --> 02:16:31.040 align:start position:0%
for free um so if you know a student was
 
02:16:33.270 --> 02:16:33.280 align:start position:0%
going to end up having some teeth or
 
02:16:35.070 --> 02:16:35.080 align:start position:0%
some money in the game why would they do
 
02:16:37.070 --> 02:16:37.080 align:start position:0%
that if the if the existing procedures
 
02:16:39.910 --> 02:16:39.920 align:start position:0%
are basically fair I suggest that you
 
02:16:42.230 --> 02:16:42.240 align:start position:0%
know is again something to to really ask
 
02:16:43.990 --> 02:16:44.000 align:start position:0%
yourself as you think about whether this
 
02:16:46.150 --> 02:16:46.160 align:start position:0%
bill is appropriate or not I'm happy to
 
02:16:47.750 --> 02:16:47.760 align:start position:0%
take questions thank you very much
 
02:16:49.150 --> 02:16:49.160 align:start position:0%
representative Lynn are there any
 
02:16:51.309 --> 02:16:51.319 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee yes
 
02:16:53.790 --> 02:16:53.800 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire thank you Mr
 
02:16:55.270 --> 02:16:55.280 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you representative for
 
02:16:57.429 --> 02:16:57.439 align:start position:0%
taking my question if we're talking here
 
02:17:00.030 --> 02:17:00.040 align:start position:0%
about fundamental rights shouldn't they
 
02:17:03.870 --> 02:17:03.880 align:start position:0%
apply to all colleges and universities
 
02:17:05.870 --> 02:17:05.880 align:start position:0%
and not just public
 
02:17:08.389 --> 02:17:08.399 align:start position:0%
ones well I think the the problem would
 
02:17:11.030 --> 02:17:11.040 align:start position:0%
be if private um you know the
 
02:17:14.070 --> 02:17:14.080 align:start position:0%
Constitution doesn't generally um
 
02:17:17.629 --> 02:17:17.639 align:start position:0%
regulate private activity so if it's a
 
02:17:21.910 --> 02:17:21.920 align:start position:0%
if it's a if a private college
 
02:17:24.950 --> 02:17:24.960 align:start position:0%
um private Co I guess maybe the bluntest
 
02:17:26.709 --> 02:17:26.719 align:start position:0%
way to put it is private colleges can't
 
02:17:28.349 --> 02:17:28.359 align:start position:0%
violate your constitutional rights
 
02:17:29.750 --> 02:17:29.760 align:start position:0%
because it's the the Constitution
 
02:17:33.190 --> 02:17:33.200 align:start position:0%
applies against the government um so
 
02:17:35.990 --> 02:17:36.000 align:start position:0%
that I think that's yes you may thank
 
02:17:38.549 --> 02:17:38.559 align:start position:0%
you well we have some institutions like
 
02:17:42.629 --> 02:17:42.639 align:start position:0%
the human rights uh commission which
 
02:17:45.709 --> 02:17:45.719 align:start position:0%
apply to all employment not just you
 
02:17:48.549 --> 02:17:48.559 align:start position:0%
know apply rights for all employment is
 
02:17:51.709 --> 02:17:51.719 align:start position:0%
that only because there's specific kinds
 
02:17:53.270 --> 02:17:53.280 align:start position:0%
of rights in the
 
02:17:55.349 --> 02:17:55.359 align:start position:0%
Constitution that are different than
 
02:17:55.359 --> 02:17:56.629 align:start position:0%
Constitution that are different than
these

02:17:56.629 --> 02:17:56.639 align:start position:0%
these
 
02:18:00.309 --> 02:18:00.319 align:start position:0%
rights well no we in other words we have
 
02:18:02.230 --> 02:18:02.240 align:start position:0%
um in for example this you know the
 
02:18:05.190 --> 02:18:05.200 align:start position:0%
Human Rights Act we have listed certain
 
02:18:07.509 --> 02:18:07.519 align:start position:0%
kinds of discrimination based I mean
 
02:18:10.509 --> 02:18:10.519 align:start position:0%
basically you know racial sexual uh
 
02:18:12.629 --> 02:18:12.639 align:start position:0%
sexual orientation those kind of things
 
02:18:16.950 --> 02:18:16.960 align:start position:0%
whereas this um is is sort of a general
 
02:18:20.150 --> 02:18:20.160 align:start position:0%
due process right I um that that applies
 
02:18:22.469 --> 02:18:22.479 align:start position:0%
against the government I I mean I
 
02:18:22.479 --> 02:18:24.030 align:start position:0%
against the government I I mean I
suppose

02:18:24.030 --> 02:18:24.040 align:start position:0%
suppose
 
02:18:26.270 --> 02:18:26.280 align:start position:0%
well I don't I mean I guess there would
 
02:18:28.549 --> 02:18:28.559 align:start position:0%
be a question of whether we would have
 
02:18:28.559 --> 02:18:29.709 align:start position:0%
be a question of whether we would have
the

02:18:29.709 --> 02:18:29.719 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:18:34.589 --> 02:18:34.599 align:start position:0%
authority um the power to um require
 
02:18:34.599 --> 02:18:35.990 align:start position:0%
authority um the power to um require
private

02:18:35.990 --> 02:18:36.000 align:start position:0%
private
 
02:18:39.270 --> 02:18:39.280 align:start position:0%
institutions uh to adopt these kind of
 
02:18:42.830 --> 02:18:42.840 align:start position:0%
procedures and you know I I I don't know
 
02:18:44.950 --> 02:18:44.960 align:start position:0%
the I'm not sure I I I really want to
 
02:18:46.349 --> 02:18:46.359 align:start position:0%
think very carefully about it I'm not
 
02:18:48.750 --> 02:18:48.760 align:start position:0%
sure that we that the state would have
 
02:18:51.750 --> 02:18:51.760 align:start position:0%
the authority um to do
 
02:18:56.910 --> 02:18:56.920 align:start position:0%
that thank you representative uh
 
02:18:59.070 --> 02:18:59.080 align:start position:0%
Damon thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
02:19:00.549 --> 02:19:00.559 align:start position:0%
taking my
 
02:19:03.110 --> 02:19:03.120 align:start position:0%
question so if I understood you
 
02:19:05.629 --> 02:19:05.639 align:start position:0%
correctly you informed us that you're
 
02:19:08.709 --> 02:19:08.719 align:start position:0%
only aware of a couple of anecdotal
 
02:19:11.429 --> 02:19:11.439 align:start position:0%
cases that would have been handled
 
02:19:15.309 --> 02:19:15.319 align:start position:0%
differently if this statute If This Were
 
02:19:15.319 --> 02:19:16.910 align:start position:0%
differently if this statute If This Were
statute

02:19:16.910 --> 02:19:16.920 align:start position:0%
statute
 
02:19:20.230 --> 02:19:20.240 align:start position:0%
and it doesn't sound like you're clear
 
02:19:23.270 --> 02:19:23.280 align:start position:0%
on what the current policies and
 
02:19:25.790 --> 02:19:25.800 align:start position:0%
procedures at the University or
 
02:19:27.830 --> 02:19:27.840 align:start position:0%
Community College systems
 
02:19:31.709 --> 02:19:31.719 align:start position:0%
are so I'm wondering if you could share
 
02:19:31.719 --> 02:19:32.790 align:start position:0%
are so I'm wondering if you could share
what

02:19:32.790 --> 02:19:32.800 align:start position:0%
what
 
02:19:34.790 --> 02:19:34.800 align:start position:0%
initiated why you think there's Merit
 
02:19:37.509 --> 02:19:37.519 align:start position:0%
for this to go forward in the absence of
 
02:19:39.910 --> 02:19:39.920 align:start position:0%
understanding what happens presently BEC
 
02:19:41.629 --> 02:19:41.639 align:start position:0%
well I guess what I would say is the
 
02:19:43.870 --> 02:19:43.880 align:start position:0%
when I was speaking before I was
 
02:19:45.910 --> 02:19:45.920 align:start position:0%
speaking about my my own personal
 
02:19:47.509 --> 02:19:47.519 align:start position:0%
knowledge and things that have happened
 
02:19:50.429 --> 02:19:50.439 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire my understanding um
 
02:19:52.070 --> 02:19:52.080 align:start position:0%
from from you know from a number of
 
02:19:55.230 --> 02:19:55.240 align:start position:0%
different sources is is that this you
 
02:20:00.469 --> 02:20:00.479 align:start position:0%
know there have been um sort of uh
 
02:20:02.990 --> 02:20:03.000 align:start position:0%
horrendous situations in other states
 
02:20:05.349 --> 02:20:05.359 align:start position:0%
involving some given publicity some not
 
02:20:07.830 --> 02:20:07.840 align:start position:0%
I can't sort of recall specifics of any
 
02:20:11.030 --> 02:20:11.040 align:start position:0%
offand but that there were a number of
 
02:20:14.670 --> 02:20:14.680 align:start position:0%
uh instances around the country um of
 
02:20:16.910 --> 02:20:16.920 align:start position:0%
relatively publicized instances of you
 
02:20:21.790 --> 02:20:21.800 align:start position:0%
know of uh processes that weren't fair
 
02:20:24.870 --> 02:20:24.880 align:start position:0%
and again as I understand it and I I
 
02:20:26.550 --> 02:20:26.560 align:start position:0%
have to be careful because I'm not
 
02:20:29.270 --> 02:20:29.280 align:start position:0%
positive on exactly how far the decision
 
02:20:31.429 --> 02:20:31.439 align:start position:0%
went but I I I understand that there was
 
02:20:34.309 --> 02:20:34.319 align:start position:0%
a um uh to the extent that the Biden
 
02:20:36.510 --> 02:20:36.520 align:start position:0%
administration had sort of reimplemented
 
02:20:39.389 --> 02:20:39.399 align:start position:0%
the title 9 that at least a one Court in
 
02:20:43.630 --> 02:20:43.640 align:start position:0%
Kentucky I believe had enjoined the uh
 
02:20:46.230 --> 02:20:46.240 align:start position:0%
had enjoined the enforcement now whether
 
02:20:50.150 --> 02:20:50.160 align:start position:0%
that applied across the board or was
 
02:20:54.190 --> 02:20:54.200 align:start position:0%
limited to the sort of transgender issue
 
02:20:56.469 --> 02:20:56.479 align:start position:0%
I'm not I'm frankly not positive on that
 
02:20:59.309 --> 02:20:59.319 align:start position:0%
but I think I guess what I'm saying is I
 
02:21:00.790 --> 02:21:00.800 align:start position:0%
you know the the motivation for this
 
02:21:05.309 --> 02:21:05.319 align:start position:0%
bill was what what I regarded as really
 
02:21:06.670 --> 02:21:06.680 align:start position:0%
a very
 
02:21:10.429 --> 02:21:10.439 align:start position:0%
unfair procedure by initially the Biden
 
02:21:12.550 --> 02:21:12.560 align:start position:0%
Administration and and then later the B
 
02:21:13.670 --> 02:21:13.680 align:start position:0%
I mean initially the Obama
 
02:21:16.710 --> 02:21:16.720 align:start position:0%
Administration and then later the Biden
 
02:21:16.720 --> 02:21:18.510 align:start position:0%
Administration and then later the Biden
Administration

02:21:18.510 --> 02:21:18.520 align:start position:0%
Administration
 
02:21:21.790 --> 02:21:21.800 align:start position:0%
quickly thank you could you share with
 
02:21:24.510 --> 02:21:24.520 align:start position:0%
the committee either now or as a
 
02:21:24.520 --> 02:21:25.630 align:start position:0%
the committee either now or as a
follow-up

02:21:25.630 --> 02:21:25.640 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
02:21:28.550 --> 02:21:28.560 align:start position:0%
communication the specifics of the
 
02:21:31.590 --> 02:21:31.600 align:start position:0%
regulations from the Obama and Biden
 
02:21:33.950 --> 02:21:33.960 align:start position:0%
administrations that you're referencing
 
02:21:37.389 --> 02:21:37.399 align:start position:0%
uh I I mean I I suppose I could but I
 
02:21:39.030 --> 02:21:39.040 align:start position:0%
think the committee is in as well as
 
02:21:40.670 --> 02:21:40.680 align:start position:0%
good a position to do that as I am it's
 
02:21:43.110 --> 02:21:43.120 align:start position:0%
as I understand it's Title 9 uh Title
 
02:21:46.870 --> 02:21:46.880 align:start position:0%
Nine regulations uh uh of uh I think
 
02:21:49.389 --> 02:21:49.399 align:start position:0%
it's the Education Act amendments so I
 
02:21:51.150 --> 02:21:51.160 align:start position:0%
I'm I mean
 
02:21:52.990 --> 02:21:53.000 align:start position:0%
you know I I I could find it but I think
 
02:21:54.790 --> 02:21:54.800 align:start position:0%
you're probably in as good a position as
 
02:21:57.590 --> 02:21:57.600 align:start position:0%
as me to find I just wanted to be clear
 
02:22:00.150 --> 02:22:00.160 align:start position:0%
what you were referencing F further
 
02:22:02.190 --> 02:22:02.200 align:start position:0%
questions represent
 
02:22:04.349 --> 02:22:04.359 align:start position:0%
hean thank you for bringing this forward
 
02:22:06.830 --> 02:22:06.840 align:start position:0%
and thank you Mr chairman um and thank
 
02:22:08.910 --> 02:22:08.920 align:start position:0%
you for your clarity as well I just am
 
02:22:12.429 --> 02:22:12.439 align:start position:0%
very curious uh has thought been given
 
02:22:14.910 --> 02:22:14.920 align:start position:0%
to extending these rights specifically
 
02:22:16.870 --> 02:22:16.880 align:start position:0%
also to high schools and to public
 
02:22:18.910 --> 02:22:18.920 align:start position:0%
employees in the high schools and the
 
02:22:21.590 --> 02:22:21.600 align:start position:0%
public schools
 
02:22:24.870 --> 02:22:24.880 align:start position:0%
um to be to be completely candid with
 
02:22:27.469 --> 02:22:27.479 align:start position:0%
you I had not you know that was not
 
02:22:30.710 --> 02:22:30.720 align:start position:0%
something that I thought of as I uh
 
02:22:34.150 --> 02:22:34.160 align:start position:0%
drafted this whether that would be um a
 
02:22:36.150 --> 02:22:36.160 align:start position:0%
good idea or not
 
02:22:38.750 --> 02:22:38.760 align:start position:0%
um uh I guess I'd want some more time to
 
02:22:39.830 --> 02:22:39.840 align:start position:0%
think about this but I certainly
 
02:22:41.510 --> 02:22:41.520 align:start position:0%
wouldn't I wouldn't you know dismiss it
 
02:22:43.030 --> 02:22:43.040 align:start position:0%
out of hand for
 
02:22:46.469 --> 02:22:46.479 align:start position:0%
sure where the questions represent
 
02:22:49.469 --> 02:22:49.479 align:start position:0%
Ames this really is a follow on from
 
02:22:51.790 --> 02:22:51.800 align:start position:0%
representative Damon line of questioning
 
02:22:55.190 --> 02:22:55.200 align:start position:0%
um youve you spoke of I think adding or
 
02:22:59.429 --> 02:22:59.439 align:start position:0%
changing the uh 188 K5 provision
 
02:23:01.830 --> 02:23:01.840 align:start position:0%
relating to collective bargaining
 
02:23:06.309 --> 02:23:06.319 align:start position:0%
agreements and um that uh leads me to
 
02:23:10.469 --> 02:23:10.479 align:start position:0%
ask what is in those agreements that you
 
02:23:14.309 --> 02:23:14.319 align:start position:0%
know of that uh would be allowed to
 
02:23:17.389 --> 02:23:17.399 align:start position:0%
continue and then would
 
02:23:20.790 --> 02:23:20.800 align:start position:0%
expire naturally at the end of the term
 
02:23:24.269 --> 02:23:24.279 align:start position:0%
limit is stated in the agreement that uh
 
02:23:27.349 --> 02:23:27.359 align:start position:0%
that may differ from what's in
 
02:23:29.790 --> 02:23:29.800 align:start position:0%
this you know I mean that that is an
 
02:23:34.190 --> 02:23:34.200 align:start position:0%
excellent question and as I said I from
 
02:23:36.110 --> 02:23:36.120 align:start position:0%
I don't know the answer to that question
 
02:23:37.950 --> 02:23:37.960 align:start position:0%
and from
 
02:23:41.110 --> 02:23:41.120 align:start position:0%
the evidence that was presented at the
 
02:23:43.950 --> 02:23:43.960 align:start position:0%
hearing last year and I maybe something
 
02:23:45.590 --> 02:23:45.600 align:start position:0%
will be presented differently this year
 
02:23:47.630 --> 02:23:47.640 align:start position:0%
I know there are representatives from
 
02:23:48.910 --> 02:23:48.920 align:start position:0%
the University system and the community
 
02:23:51.269 --> 02:23:51.279 align:start position:0%
college system here
 
02:23:53.429 --> 02:23:53.439 align:start position:0%
my recollection of the testimony last
 
02:23:57.830 --> 02:23:57.840 align:start position:0%
year was General statements from those
 
02:24:00.429 --> 02:24:00.439 align:start position:0%
Representatives that we have procedures
 
02:24:03.150 --> 02:24:03.160 align:start position:0%
in effect that are fair procedures and
 
02:24:05.469 --> 02:24:05.479 align:start position:0%
that everybody's happy with them what
 
02:24:08.190 --> 02:24:08.200 align:start position:0%
exactly those procedures
 
02:24:12.269 --> 02:24:12.279 align:start position:0%
were um it was never stated so I don't
 
02:24:16.670 --> 02:24:16.680 align:start position:0%
know exactly what those procedures were
 
02:24:20.550 --> 02:24:20.560 align:start position:0%
um but as I said I when they say it's
 
02:24:23.110 --> 02:24:23.120 align:start position:0%
going to cost $500,000 to implement
 
02:24:25.429 --> 02:24:25.439 align:start position:0%
these procedures that suggests to me
 
02:24:27.150 --> 02:24:27.160 align:start position:0%
that whatever their procedures are they
 
02:24:30.469 --> 02:24:30.479 align:start position:0%
must be quite different than what I
 
02:24:32.269 --> 02:24:32.279 align:start position:0%
think are sort of the basic fairness
 
02:24:34.710 --> 02:24:34.720 align:start position:0%
procedures that are specified in this
 
02:24:40.110 --> 02:24:40.120 align:start position:0%
bill okay thank you yes representative
 
02:24:43.469 --> 02:24:43.479 align:start position:0%
Burton excuse me uh thank you for taking
 
02:24:47.429 --> 02:24:47.439 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question um as having
 
02:24:49.429 --> 02:24:49.439 align:start position:0%
been a Dean a couple of times and
 
02:24:51.150 --> 02:24:51.160 align:start position:0%
president of two
 
02:24:53.510 --> 02:24:53.520 align:start position:0%
colleges my general impression is you're
 
02:24:55.150 --> 02:24:55.160 align:start position:0%
looking for a
 
02:24:57.550 --> 02:24:57.560 align:start position:0%
solution uh trying to find a problem
 
02:25:00.429 --> 02:25:00.439 align:start position:0%
that needs a solution all of the schools
 
02:25:04.870 --> 02:25:04.880 align:start position:0%
I know of and in higher education have
 
02:25:04.880 --> 02:25:06.309 align:start position:0%
I know of and in higher education have
really

02:25:06.309 --> 02:25:06.319 align:start position:0%
really
 
02:25:10.230 --> 02:25:10.240 align:start position:0%
tight processes that to to protect the
 
02:25:13.750 --> 02:25:13.760 align:start position:0%
students and the institution in a unique
 
02:25:16.070 --> 02:25:16.080 align:start position:0%
situation where if someone commits a
 
02:25:18.790 --> 02:25:18.800 align:start position:0%
crime in a dormatory they're going back
 
02:25:18.800 --> 02:25:20.590 align:start position:0%
crime in a dormatory they're going back
into

02:25:20.590 --> 02:25:20.600 align:start position:0%
into
 
02:25:22.150 --> 02:25:22.160 align:start position:0%
you have to count for the setting the
 
02:25:25.670 --> 02:25:25.680 align:start position:0%
students in anyway um can you site any
 
02:25:29.309 --> 02:25:29.319 align:start position:0%
any kind of problem that has
 
02:25:32.590 --> 02:25:32.600 align:start position:0%
happened that caus you to believe you
 
02:25:35.309 --> 02:25:35.319 align:start position:0%
should impose a state law on the
 
02:25:37.710 --> 02:25:37.720 align:start position:0%
institutions who now are required to
 
02:25:41.590 --> 02:25:41.600 align:start position:0%
already have uh processes in place and
 
02:25:44.269 --> 02:25:44.279 align:start position:0%
and I sure if you wanted to see them
 
02:25:47.870 --> 02:25:47.880 align:start position:0%
they would send them to you um and
 
02:25:50.030 --> 02:25:50.040 align:start position:0%
that's why I'm concerned about adding a
 
02:25:53.150 --> 02:25:53.160 align:start position:0%
third third party to a process that's
 
02:25:56.870 --> 02:25:56.880 align:start position:0%
already in existent already proven and
 
02:25:59.590 --> 02:25:59.600 align:start position:0%
has tested past the test of
 
02:26:01.950 --> 02:26:01.960 align:start position:0%
times well I guess the way I would
 
02:26:03.349 --> 02:26:03.359 align:start position:0%
respond to that you know was again if
 
02:26:05.790 --> 02:26:05.800 align:start position:0%
you're asking me to site to you some the
 
02:26:08.110 --> 02:26:08.120 align:start position:0%
details of some specific case no I I
 
02:26:10.870 --> 02:26:10.880 align:start position:0%
cannot do that um but what I guess I
 
02:26:12.510 --> 02:26:12.520 align:start position:0%
would say
 
02:26:14.750 --> 02:26:14.760 align:start position:0%
is you've said they already have
 
02:26:16.590 --> 02:26:16.600 align:start position:0%
procedures in a place that are you know
 
02:26:19.590 --> 02:26:19.600 align:start position:0%
that are just working fine how do those
 
02:26:22.670 --> 02:26:22.680 align:start position:0%
procedures from this what I mean don't
 
02:26:25.110 --> 02:26:25.120 align:start position:0%
you don't get adequate notice or you do
 
02:26:27.190 --> 02:26:27.200 align:start position:0%
get adequate notice and if you do then
 
02:26:29.389 --> 02:26:29.399 align:start position:0%
then the change caus then then there
 
02:26:30.469 --> 02:26:30.479 align:start position:0%
really is no
 
02:26:33.710 --> 02:26:33.720 align:start position:0%
change uh proposed by this bill if you
 
02:26:37.670 --> 02:26:37.680 align:start position:0%
have the presumption of innocence under
 
02:26:39.550 --> 02:26:39.560 align:start position:0%
the practices that you're talking about
 
02:26:42.269 --> 02:26:42.279 align:start position:0%
that exist then there is no change on
 
02:26:43.469 --> 02:26:43.479 align:start position:0%
the other hand if you don't then there
 
02:26:46.070 --> 02:26:46.080 align:start position:0%
is and I would submit there should be Mr
 
02:26:49.469 --> 02:26:49.479 align:start position:0%
chairman that followup um i s I can
 
02:26:51.309 --> 02:26:51.319 align:start position:0%
assure you that any institution you
 
02:26:53.190 --> 02:26:53.200 align:start position:0%
requested that information from would
 
02:26:54.830 --> 02:26:54.840 align:start position:0%
provide it including the University of
 
02:26:58.190 --> 02:26:58.200 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire um and again I get I I get
 
02:27:01.309 --> 02:27:01.319 align:start position:0%
concerned what are you talking
 
02:27:03.309 --> 02:27:03.319 align:start position:0%
about is it
 
02:27:05.870 --> 02:27:05.880 align:start position:0%
a anyway thank you for your thank you
 
02:27:07.510 --> 02:27:07.520 align:start position:0%
for taking my question he remember we
 
02:27:10.990 --> 02:27:11.000 align:start position:0%
got to be ask specific questions here uh
 
02:27:13.389 --> 02:27:13.399 align:start position:0%
further questions from the
 
02:27:17.830 --> 02:27:17.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:21.590 --> 02:27:21.600 align:start position:0%
Brown thank you for coming today
 
02:27:25.910 --> 02:27:25.920 align:start position:0%
um as an educator a college professor um
 
02:27:28.950 --> 02:27:28.960 align:start position:0%
is a college professor of overp decades
 
02:27:31.710 --> 02:27:31.720 align:start position:0%
I've seen numerous examples of cases
 
02:27:35.710 --> 02:27:35.720 align:start position:0%
where faculty have suffered um
 
02:27:37.870 --> 02:27:37.880 align:start position:0%
discrimination um and problems with
 
02:27:40.750 --> 02:27:40.760 align:start position:0%
their basic rights at college campuses
 
02:27:43.190 --> 02:27:43.200 align:start position:0%
so I can think of specific cases where
 
02:27:45.710 --> 02:27:45.720 align:start position:0%
this has been an issue but my question
 
02:27:49.710 --> 02:27:49.720 align:start position:0%
is um concerning part two faculty
 
02:27:53.110 --> 02:27:53.120 align:start position:0%
members where you say that faculty
 
02:27:55.630 --> 02:27:55.640 align:start position:0%
member will not include um someone who
 
02:27:58.230 --> 02:27:58.240 align:start position:0%
has has a probationary status because
 
02:28:00.429 --> 02:28:00.439 align:start position:0%
probationary faculty in my experience
 
02:28:03.349 --> 02:28:03.359 align:start position:0%
have been the most vulnerable of Staff
 
02:28:06.990 --> 02:28:07.000 align:start position:0%
when it comes to particular abuses of
 
02:28:08.830 --> 02:28:08.840 align:start position:0%
rights as they're attempting to get
 
02:28:12.230 --> 02:28:12.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:14.349 --> 02:28:14.359 align:start position:0%
colleges well I
 
02:28:18.150 --> 02:28:18.160 align:start position:0%
mean you you raise a a valid point and I
 
02:28:20.950 --> 02:28:20.960 align:start position:0%
have to say I uh
 
02:28:26.429 --> 02:28:26.439 align:start position:0%
um I put that in there because I guess I
 
02:28:29.230 --> 02:28:29.240 align:start position:0%
generally thought that you know it's
 
02:28:33.150 --> 02:28:33.160 align:start position:0%
it's it it's it's not unusual for new
 
02:28:35.670 --> 02:28:35.680 align:start position:0%
employees to have
 
02:28:38.469 --> 02:28:38.479 align:start position:0%
less you know to have less rights so to
 
02:28:40.190 --> 02:28:40.200 align:start position:0%
speak than than somebody who's been
 
02:28:42.870 --> 02:28:42.880 align:start position:0%
there for a while but you know if if
 
02:28:44.429 --> 02:28:44.439 align:start position:0%
you're suggesting that that should be
 
02:28:46.070 --> 02:28:46.080 align:start position:0%
changed so that it should apply to new
 
02:28:48.630 --> 02:28:48.640 align:start position:0%
employees I'm you get you get no
 
02:28:51.110 --> 02:28:51.120 align:start position:0%
objection from me I think
 
02:28:55.670 --> 02:28:55.680 align:start position:0%
that fair I I I favor fairness rather
 
02:28:59.389 --> 02:28:59.399 align:start position:0%
than unfairness uh every time thank you
 
02:29:02.070 --> 02:29:02.080 align:start position:0%
further questions representa spillsbury
 
02:29:04.710 --> 02:29:04.720 align:start position:0%
um I'm just curious because I read that
 
02:29:06.590 --> 02:29:06.600 align:start position:0%
phrase differently you're talking about
 
02:29:08.790 --> 02:29:08.800 align:start position:0%
probationary status as somebody who's
 
02:29:12.349 --> 02:29:12.359 align:start position:0%
new during maybe a 90day exactly that's
 
02:29:14.429 --> 02:29:14.439 align:start position:0%
what I had in mind whereas whereas I had
 
02:29:16.590 --> 02:29:16.600 align:start position:0%
read it to refer to somebody who's
 
02:29:18.630 --> 02:29:18.640 align:start position:0%
already had a problem and was placed on
 
02:29:20.550 --> 02:29:20.560 align:start position:0%
probation yeah yeah
 
02:29:24.510 --> 02:29:24.520 align:start position:0%
I you know no you raise you raise a a a
 
02:29:26.510 --> 02:29:26.520 align:start position:0%
valid point that I had I had not
 
02:29:28.150 --> 02:29:28.160 align:start position:0%
intended it that way but you raise a
 
02:29:29.910 --> 02:29:29.920 align:start position:0%
valid point and I would suggest that
 
02:29:32.389 --> 02:29:32.399 align:start position:0%
maybe you know an amendment to make that
 
02:29:35.469 --> 02:29:35.479 align:start position:0%
very clear that the somebody who's who
 
02:29:37.469 --> 02:29:37.479 align:start position:0%
has been employed for less than 90 days
 
02:29:39.469 --> 02:29:39.479 align:start position:0%
or what six months or whatever it might
 
02:29:41.429 --> 02:29:41.439 align:start position:0%
be but that that's a very valid point I
 
02:29:43.230 --> 02:29:43.240 align:start position:0%
I did not mean it to be somebody that
 
02:29:46.910 --> 02:29:46.920 align:start position:0%
was already disciplined yeah good point
 
02:29:48.990 --> 02:29:49.000 align:start position:0%
further questions we do have more people
 
02:29:50.550 --> 02:29:50.560 align:start position:0%
coming up but you
 
02:29:52.469 --> 02:29:52.479 align:start position:0%
represent fellows you have a
 
02:29:55.950 --> 02:29:55.960 align:start position:0%
question so I just on on the last page
 
02:29:59.469 --> 02:29:59.479 align:start position:0%
at the end of K uh four it says that the
 
02:30:03.469 --> 02:30:03.479 align:start position:0%
organization can't um do something that
 
02:30:06.870 --> 02:30:06.880 align:start position:0%
gives the dis the person being dis
 
02:30:10.070 --> 02:30:10.080 align:start position:0%
disciplined um less protections right
 
02:30:13.429 --> 02:30:13.439 align:start position:0%
but then in the next section down below
 
02:30:15.830 --> 02:30:15.840 align:start position:0%
which I assume means that that they can
 
02:30:17.990 --> 02:30:18.000 align:start position:0%
the institution can give them more
 
02:30:21.070 --> 02:30:21.080 align:start position:0%
exactly but when you get down to five it
 
02:30:22.790 --> 02:30:22.800 align:start position:0%
says after the end of the collective
 
02:30:25.190 --> 02:30:25.200 align:start position:0%
bargaining agreement they have to use
 
02:30:27.710 --> 02:30:27.720 align:start position:0%
the ones in this statute no it says
 
02:30:30.150 --> 02:30:30.160 align:start position:0%
which contains grievance procedures
 
02:30:32.110 --> 02:30:32.120 align:start position:0%
grievance or disciplinary procedures
 
02:30:35.389 --> 02:30:35.399 align:start position:0%
less protective of fact they cannot have
 
02:30:37.550 --> 02:30:37.560 align:start position:0%
they cannot adopt grievance or
 
02:30:39.750 --> 02:30:39.760 align:start position:0%
disciplinary procedures that are less
 
02:30:42.349 --> 02:30:42.359 align:start position:0%
protective than the ones in the statute
 
02:30:45.190 --> 02:30:45.200 align:start position:0%
they could certainly understand but in
 
02:30:48.790 --> 02:30:48.800 align:start position:0%
in five it says when they when there's a
 
02:30:51.349 --> 02:30:51.359 align:start position:0%
conflict what are supposed to do are
 
02:30:53.550 --> 02:30:53.560 align:start position:0%
aren't they supposed to adopt the ones
 
02:30:54.910 --> 02:30:54.920 align:start position:0%
in this
 
02:30:57.469 --> 02:30:57.479 align:start position:0%
statute no I think what it says is you
 
02:31:01.870 --> 02:31:01.880 align:start position:0%
can't that you that they cannot adopt
 
02:31:04.950 --> 02:31:04.960 align:start position:0%
from an let me read the last sentence
 
02:31:07.030 --> 02:31:07.040 align:start position:0%
from and after the effective date of
 
02:31:09.670 --> 02:31:09.680 align:start position:0%
this chapter no institution of higher
 
02:31:11.630 --> 02:31:11.640 align:start position:0%
education and no Union representing
 
02:31:13.990 --> 02:31:14.000 align:start position:0%
faculty members of such institution
 
02:31:16.269 --> 02:31:16.279 align:start position:0%
shall enter into any new collective
 
02:31:18.349 --> 02:31:18.359 align:start position:0%
bargaining agreement nor extend the
 
02:31:19.910 --> 02:31:19.920 align:start position:0%
expiration date of an existing
 
02:31:21.790 --> 02:31:21.800 align:start position:0%
collective bargaining agreement which
 
02:31:24.230 --> 02:31:24.240 align:start position:0%
contains grievance procedures grievance
 
02:31:26.590 --> 02:31:26.600 align:start position:0%
or disciplinary procedures less
 
02:31:29.150 --> 02:31:29.160 align:start position:0%
protective of Faculty members do process
 
02:31:30.830 --> 02:31:30.840 align:start position:0%
rights than those established in this
 
02:31:34.469 --> 02:31:34.479 align:start position:0%
chapter so they can they can have they
 
02:31:34.479 --> 02:31:35.389 align:start position:0%
chapter so they can they can have they
can

02:31:35.389 --> 02:31:35.399 align:start position:0%
can
 
02:31:38.349 --> 02:31:38.359 align:start position:0%
adopt procedures that Grant more
 
02:31:41.269 --> 02:31:41.279 align:start position:0%
protection okay thank you but not less
 
02:31:43.070 --> 02:31:43.080 align:start position:0%
good further
 
02:31:44.830 --> 02:31:44.840 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much
 
02:31:47.750 --> 02:31:47.760 align:start position:0%

your time this afternoon um
 
02:32:36.110 --> 02:32:36.120 align:start position:0%
representative Lynn is correct that the
 
02:32:38.710 --> 02:32:38.720 align:start position:0%
university system opposes this
 
02:32:42.990 --> 02:32:43.000 align:start position:0%
legislation um we are happy to provide
 
02:32:47.269 --> 02:32:47.279 align:start position:0%
any oh sure is that better okay we are
 
02:32:50.750 --> 02:32:50.760 align:start position:0%
happy to provide any processed documents
 
02:32:52.150 --> 02:32:52.160 align:start position:0%
we have eight different collective
 
02:32:55.230 --> 02:32:55.240 align:start position:0%
bargaining agreements with um faculty
 
02:32:57.870 --> 02:32:57.880 align:start position:0%
across the university system to provide
 
02:33:00.830 --> 02:33:00.840 align:start position:0%
you with the procedures uh enumerated in
 
02:33:02.550 --> 02:33:02.560 align:start position:0%
those collective bargaining agreements
 
02:33:05.150 --> 02:33:05.160 align:start position:0%
each of our institutions has a variety
 
02:33:08.150 --> 02:33:08.160 align:start position:0%
of policies governing due process we're
 
02:33:10.590 --> 02:33:10.600 align:start position:0%
proud of the ample due process that we
 
02:33:13.670 --> 02:33:13.680 align:start position:0%
have across the university system um I
 
02:33:16.630 --> 02:33:16.640 align:start position:0%
will speak to representative Lynn's uh
 
02:33:19.910 --> 02:33:19.920 align:start position:0%
comment around added cost when we we
 
02:33:22.870 --> 02:33:22.880 align:start position:0%
were asked to complete the ls the fiscal
 
02:33:26.269 --> 02:33:26.279 align:start position:0%
note for the LSR the word reprimand was
 
02:33:29.389 --> 02:33:29.399 align:start position:0%
still in the language and I will get to
 
02:33:33.070 --> 02:33:33.080 align:start position:0%
cost in a minute but that the the
 
02:33:34.910 --> 02:33:34.920 align:start position:0%
original language included that there
 
02:33:37.550 --> 02:33:37.560 align:start position:0%
would be Provisions for hearings and
 
02:33:39.469 --> 02:33:39.479 align:start position:0%
documentation and
 
02:33:42.349 --> 02:33:42.359 align:start position:0%
cross-examination even for a reprimand
 
02:33:44.590 --> 02:33:44.600 align:start position:0%
and that would
 
02:33:47.349 --> 02:33:47.359 align:start position:0%
absolutely we would absolutely incur
 
02:33:48.990 --> 02:33:49.000 align:start position:0%
quite a bit of additional cost if we
 
02:33:51.309 --> 02:33:51.319 align:start position:0%
were going to go through procedures for
 
02:33:52.389 --> 02:33:52.399 align:start position:0%
for a
 
02:33:55.190 --> 02:33:55.200 align:start position:0%
reprimand um I will say
 
02:33:58.990 --> 02:33:59.000 align:start position:0%
that um there's there's no such thing as
 
02:34:01.030 --> 02:34:01.040 align:start position:0%
cost-free regulation you're going to
 
02:34:03.830 --> 02:34:03.840 align:start position:0%
hear me say that probably for a number
 
02:34:06.389 --> 02:34:06.399 align:start position:0%
of bills that are coming before um your
 
02:34:09.349 --> 02:34:09.359 align:start position:0%
committee this session at a time when we
 
02:34:12.309 --> 02:34:12.319 align:start position:0%
must reduce our cost structure across
 
02:34:14.429 --> 02:34:14.439 align:start position:0%
the university system with fiscal
 
02:34:16.830 --> 02:34:16.840 align:start position:0%
challenges as well as state budget
 
02:34:20.070 --> 02:34:20.080 align:start position:0%
challenges um we do not want to add any
 
02:34:22.550 --> 02:34:22.560 align:start position:0%
administrative compliance
 
02:34:25.630 --> 02:34:25.640 align:start position:0%
regulatory action um to the work that
 
02:34:30.309 --> 02:34:30.319 align:start position:0%
we're doing we I as I mentioned uh we do
 
02:34:33.990 --> 02:34:34.000 align:start position:0%
have extensive due process procedures
 
02:34:36.190 --> 02:34:36.200 align:start position:0%
that that work for each of our
 
02:34:38.269 --> 02:34:38.279 align:start position:0%
institutions and we're happy to provide
 
02:34:41.790 --> 02:34:41.800 align:start position:0%
you those uh copies of I think we did
 
02:34:43.910 --> 02:34:43.920 align:start position:0%
last session but maybe we maybe we did
 
02:34:47.750 --> 02:34:47.760 align:start position:0%
that when the bill got to the Senate um
 
02:34:50.309 --> 02:34:50.319 align:start position:0%
and we're concerned with a kind of
 
02:34:54.230 --> 02:34:54.240 align:start position:0%
one-size fits-all rigid process um
 
02:34:55.750 --> 02:34:55.760 align:start position:0%
rather than have
 
02:34:59.030 --> 02:34:59.040 align:start position:0%
institutions and the various faculty uh
 
02:35:01.990 --> 02:35:02.000 align:start position:0%
unions develop those those procedures
 
02:35:05.070 --> 02:35:05.080 align:start position:0%
and and also the
 
02:35:08.150 --> 02:35:08.160 align:start position:0%
student I know with the um our
 
02:35:11.429 --> 02:35:11.439 align:start position:0%
fraternity and sorority councils they
 
02:35:15.349 --> 02:35:15.359 align:start position:0%
have due process guidelines in place as
 
02:35:17.830 --> 02:35:17.840 align:start position:0%
well and they may vary from institution
 
02:35:20.349 --> 02:35:20.359 align:start position:0%
to institution um
 
02:35:23.230 --> 02:35:23.240 align:start position:0%
we we have specific examples we can get
 
02:35:25.950 --> 02:35:25.960 align:start position:0%
into um Lauren can walk through some of
 
02:35:31.190 --> 02:35:31.200 align:start position:0%
our specific concerns um we we are not
 
02:35:35.870 --> 02:35:35.880 align:start position:0%
aware of any problems inherent in our
 
02:35:39.950 --> 02:35:39.960 align:start position:0%
due process framework now and um but we
 
02:35:42.110 --> 02:35:42.120 align:start position:0%
do believe there would be some
 
02:35:45.950 --> 02:35:45.960 align:start position:0%
additional cost to have a hearing a
 
02:35:49.750 --> 02:35:49.760 align:start position:0%
hearing for um all the copies of all the
 
02:35:53.150 --> 02:35:53.160 align:start position:0%
documentation and interviews um it it
 
02:35:56.110 --> 02:35:56.120 align:start position:0%
could be there could be legal costs on
 
02:35:58.670 --> 02:35:58.680 align:start position:0%
the University system side as well as
 
02:36:02.389 --> 02:36:02.399 align:start position:0%
for students faculty and student
 
02:36:05.870 --> 02:36:05.880 align:start position:0%
organizations and I'll say on you know
 
02:36:08.950 --> 02:36:08.960 align:start position:0%
when it comes to cost even if it's
 
02:36:11.710 --> 02:36:11.720 align:start position:0%
$100,000 that's net tuition fees for 10
 
02:36:14.870 --> 02:36:14.880 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire students so I I'm trying
 
02:36:18.190 --> 02:36:18.200 align:start position:0%
to boil everything down to what um a
 
02:36:22.190 --> 02:36:22.200 align:start position:0%
student impact is and I um I would agree
 
02:36:23.950 --> 02:36:23.960 align:start position:0%
with representative Burton Burton's
 
02:36:23.960 --> 02:36:24.870 align:start position:0%
with representative Burton Burton's
comment

02:36:24.870 --> 02:36:24.880 align:start position:0%
comment
 
02:36:28.230 --> 02:36:28.240 align:start position:0%
that this may be a solution searching
 
02:36:32.910 --> 02:36:32.920 align:start position:0%
for a problem that will add some
 
02:36:35.710 --> 02:36:35.720 align:start position:0%
administrative burden and and cost to
 
02:36:39.110 --> 02:36:39.120 align:start position:0%
our work um I if you want uh Kathy are
 
02:36:40.590 --> 02:36:40.600 align:start position:0%
you going to take a question before you
 
02:36:42.670 --> 02:36:42.680 align:start position:0%
pass the wand on here or the Baton
 
02:36:46.190 --> 02:36:46.200 align:start position:0%
certainly um I do have a question here
 
02:36:48.590 --> 02:36:48.600 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at the last sheet which is
 
02:36:53.030 --> 02:36:53.040 align:start position:0%
the financial that You' predicted or
 
02:36:54.910 --> 02:36:54.920 align:start position:0%
proposed that this may cost three
 
02:36:57.309 --> 02:36:57.319 align:start position:0%
additional staff to manage increased
 
02:37:00.630 --> 02:37:00.640 align:start position:0%
workload if in fact much of what you're
 
02:37:04.710 --> 02:37:04.720 align:start position:0%
doing is done informally right
 
02:37:08.670 --> 02:37:08.680 align:start position:0%
now can you explain to me why three
 
02:37:10.710 --> 02:37:10.720 align:start position:0%
additional people to manage a program
 
02:37:12.070 --> 02:37:12.080 align:start position:0%
like this which is going to be dealing
 
02:37:14.309 --> 02:37:14.319 align:start position:0%
with procedures that representative Lynn
 
02:37:17.150 --> 02:37:17.160 align:start position:0%
spoke to um thank you for the question
 
02:37:18.990 --> 02:37:19.000 align:start position:0%
representative again when when we
 
02:37:22.110 --> 02:37:22.120 align:start position:0%
completed did the fiscal note the word
 
02:37:25.630 --> 02:37:25.640 align:start position:0%
reprimand okay was still in the um in
 
02:37:29.110 --> 02:37:29.120 align:start position:0%
the LSR um so I don't know that we would
 
02:37:30.750 --> 02:37:30.760 align:start position:0%
need three additional people with the
 
02:37:30.760 --> 02:37:32.870 align:start position:0%
need three additional people with the
reprimand

02:37:32.870 --> 02:37:32.880 align:start position:0%
reprimand
 
02:37:36.950 --> 02:37:36.960 align:start position:0%
excluded but again I do not believe the
 
02:37:39.309 --> 02:37:39.319 align:start position:0%
cost would be
 
02:37:42.670 --> 02:37:42.680 align:start position:0%
zero okay thank
 
02:37:47.030 --> 02:37:47.040 align:start position:0%
you represent papic is it for yes
 
02:37:50.110 --> 02:37:50.120 align:start position:0%
related if I may just additional
 
02:37:53.670 --> 02:37:53.680 align:start position:0%
clarification since the fiscal note is
 
02:37:55.710 --> 02:37:55.720 align:start position:0%
based on a version of the bill that's no
 
02:37:59.230 --> 02:37:59.240 align:start position:0%
longer here do you know whether we can
 
02:38:01.190 --> 02:38:01.200 align:start position:0%
get an updated fiscal note at least
 
02:38:02.750 --> 02:38:02.760 align:start position:0%
before we get to finance because
 
02:38:04.469 --> 02:38:04.479 align:start position:0%
obviously we need to work with the best
 
02:38:07.309 --> 02:38:07.319 align:start position:0%
data possible thank you Mr chair and I
 
02:38:10.510 --> 02:38:10.520 align:start position:0%
would say prior to yeah this committee
 
02:38:12.309 --> 02:38:12.319 align:start position:0%
also needs that fiscal
 
02:38:18.550 --> 02:38:18.560 align:start position:0%
note yeah yes okay La Lauren or can go
 
02:38:22.230 --> 02:38:22.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:24.950 --> 02:38:24.960 align:start position:0%
people you want to ask Kathy prenta
 
02:38:27.349 --> 02:38:27.359 align:start position:0%
right now or do you want to wait and ask
 
02:38:30.269 --> 02:38:30.279 align:start position:0%
the question when we really get into
 
02:38:32.550 --> 02:38:32.560 align:start position:0%
that it's up to you sir I can do let's
 
02:38:34.590 --> 02:38:34.600 align:start position:0%
go on Lauren's here let's let's get
 
02:38:36.910 --> 02:38:36.920 align:start position:0%
let's Lauren Baker banker and then we
 
02:38:40.190 --> 02:38:40.200 align:start position:0%
will get to you first question thank you
 
02:38:42.230 --> 02:38:42.240 align:start position:0%
Mr chair uh thank you members of the
 
02:38:44.710 --> 02:38:44.720 align:start position:0%
committee um as Kathy said I just wanted
 
02:38:47.389 --> 02:38:47.399 align:start position:0%
to walk through a few of the pieces of
 
02:38:50.230 --> 02:38:50.240 align:start position:0%
the bill that we have um several issues
 
02:38:52.230 --> 02:38:52.240 align:start position:0%
with um I've outlined them in the
 
02:38:54.630 --> 02:38:54.640 align:start position:0%
testimony but I'm going to just um pick
 
02:38:57.750 --> 02:38:57.760 align:start position:0%
a few to to call out um at this hearing
 
02:39:00.190 --> 02:39:00.200 align:start position:0%
so the first being if pass this bill
 
02:39:01.910 --> 02:39:01.920 align:start position:0%
would require copies of all written
 
02:39:03.830 --> 02:39:03.840 align:start position:0%
documents statements of witnesses
 
02:39:05.870 --> 02:39:05.880 align:start position:0%
photographs to be provided at least
 
02:39:09.030 --> 02:39:09.040 align:start position:0%
7even days prior to the um hearing we
 
02:39:11.150 --> 02:39:11.160 align:start position:0%
are concerned with this provision um
 
02:39:13.030 --> 02:39:13.040 align:start position:0%
because it's very possible that these
 
02:39:15.269 --> 02:39:15.279 align:start position:0%
documents could contain intimate details
 
02:39:17.830 --> 02:39:17.840 align:start position:0%
of you know sexual misconduct or in the
 
02:39:19.910 --> 02:39:19.920 align:start position:0%
case of Faculty private personal files
 
02:39:22.110 --> 02:39:22.120 align:start position:0%
Title 9 standard says that you're
 
02:39:24.309 --> 02:39:24.319 align:start position:0%
provided access to review documents but
 
02:39:26.750 --> 02:39:26.760 align:start position:0%
not provided actual copies so we're
 
02:39:28.670 --> 02:39:28.680 align:start position:0%
cautious on this believing that once the
 
02:39:30.150 --> 02:39:30.160 align:start position:0%
possession of these sensitive materials
 
02:39:32.349 --> 02:39:32.359 align:start position:0%
is out of our hands um it could have
 
02:39:35.870 --> 02:39:35.880 align:start position:0%
serious privacy concerns for folks um
 
02:39:37.670 --> 02:39:37.680 align:start position:0%
the other point that we raised here too
 
02:39:39.750 --> 02:39:39.760 align:start position:0%
is um connected to the confront and
 
02:39:42.230 --> 02:39:42.240 align:start position:0%
cross-examine witness um piece of
 
02:39:46.469 --> 02:39:46.479 align:start position:0%
language in the bill um it says uh that
 
02:39:48.070 --> 02:39:48.080 align:start position:0%
uh folks are provided the right to
 
02:39:49.910 --> 02:39:49.920 align:start position:0%
confront and cross-examine Witnesses who
 
02:39:51.910 --> 02:39:51.920 align:start position:0%
provide evidence against the student
 
02:39:54.429 --> 02:39:54.439 align:start position:0%
student organization or faculty member
 
02:39:56.230 --> 02:39:56.240 align:start position:0%
current Title 9 allows for cross-
 
02:39:57.990 --> 02:39:58.000 align:start position:0%
examination but it must be done by an
 
02:40:00.469 --> 02:40:00.479 align:start position:0%
advisor so we feel with the bill as
 
02:40:02.150 --> 02:40:02.160 align:start position:0%
written you know we could have a student
 
02:40:03.830 --> 02:40:03.840 align:start position:0%
accused of sexual assault directly
 
02:40:05.389 --> 02:40:05.399 align:start position:0%
confronting and questioning the impact
 
02:40:07.710 --> 02:40:07.720 align:start position:0%
of parties with victim Survivor in this
 
02:40:10.070 --> 02:40:10.080 align:start position:0%
case um and we really think we could see
 
02:40:11.590 --> 02:40:11.600 align:start position:0%
a chilling effect on this and the
 
02:40:13.070 --> 02:40:13.080 align:start position:0%
likelihood of future parties bringing
 
02:40:15.150 --> 02:40:15.160 align:start position:0%
reports participating in this sort of
 
02:40:18.230 --> 02:40:18.240 align:start position:0%
resolution process um the final thing I
 
02:40:19.950 --> 02:40:19.960 align:start position:0%
wanted to raise also has to do with a
 
02:40:23.070 --> 02:40:23.080 align:start position:0%
confront and cross-examine piece um so
 
02:40:25.670 --> 02:40:25.680 align:start position:0%
this would this would be permitted um
 
02:40:29.070 --> 02:40:29.080 align:start position:0%
for any person to do against anyone um
 
02:40:31.309 --> 02:40:31.319 align:start position:0%
who is uh providing evidence against the
 
02:40:32.910 --> 02:40:32.920 align:start position:0%
student student organization or faculty
 
02:40:36.309 --> 02:40:36.319 align:start position:0%
member so we see a costly solution with
 
02:40:37.630 --> 02:40:37.640 align:start position:0%
this and you know the time that would
 
02:40:39.429 --> 02:40:39.439 align:start position:0%
need to be done is you know for every
 
02:40:40.830 --> 02:40:40.840 align:start position:0%
underage student who might be caught
 
02:40:43.110 --> 02:40:43.120 align:start position:0%
drinking would they would we be required
 
02:40:45.190 --> 02:40:45.200 align:start position:0%
to call upon each police officer who
 
02:40:46.550 --> 02:40:46.560 align:start position:0%
made the arrest for
 
02:40:48.750 --> 02:40:48.760 align:start position:0%
cross-examining um and you know our
 
02:40:48.760 --> 02:40:49.750 align:start position:0%
cross-examining um and you know our
current

02:40:49.750 --> 02:40:49.760 align:start position:0%
current
 
02:40:51.309 --> 02:40:51.319 align:start position:0%
uh resolution for that is you know if
 
02:40:53.469 --> 02:40:53.479 align:start position:0%
it's a student's first offense they're
 
02:40:54.910 --> 02:40:54.920 align:start position:0%
given warning they're required to
 
02:40:56.910 --> 02:40:56.920 align:start position:0%
complete a mandatory alcohol and drug
 
02:40:58.990 --> 02:40:59.000 align:start position:0%
education counseling course but an
 
02:41:00.990 --> 02:41:01.000 align:start position:0%
extensive disciplinary hearing where we
 
02:41:03.870 --> 02:41:03.880 align:start position:0%
bring in Witnesses um would be deemed
 
02:41:06.110 --> 02:41:06.120 align:start position:0%
costly and
 
02:41:07.910 --> 02:41:07.920 align:start position:0%
unnecessary those are the few that I
 
02:41:09.429 --> 02:41:09.439 align:start position:0%
wanted to raise and I'll pass it back to
 
02:41:12.150 --> 02:41:12.160 align:start position:0%
Kathy and we can answer questions okay
 
02:41:15.950 --> 02:41:15.960 align:start position:0%
repon B you had a question yes um there
 
02:41:18.750 --> 02:41:18.760 align:start position:0%
was an incident at UNH in June I'm very
 
02:41:21.469 --> 02:41:21.479 align:start position:0%
familiar with where students protested
 
02:41:21.479 --> 02:41:22.309 align:start position:0%
familiar with where students protested
that

02:41:22.309 --> 02:41:22.319 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:41:24.389 --> 02:41:24.399 align:start position:0%
violence in
 
02:41:28.269 --> 02:41:28.279 align:start position:0%
Gaza um I was really impressed with the
 
02:41:31.269 --> 02:41:31.279 align:start position:0%
way uh president Chilton who came in
 
02:41:32.670 --> 02:41:32.680 align:start position:0%
after the
 
02:41:36.469 --> 02:41:36.479 align:start position:0%
event made sure that all of the students
 
02:41:38.550 --> 02:41:38.560 align:start position:0%
involved were given due
 
02:41:41.910 --> 02:41:41.920 align:start position:0%
process uh for that it was a very
 
02:41:45.630 --> 02:41:45.640 align:start position:0%
complicated system but I I must say and
 
02:41:48.110 --> 02:41:48.120 align:start position:0%
I I wrote the resolution in the Town
 
02:41:51.389 --> 02:41:51.399 align:start position:0%
Council uh expressing concerns about
 
02:41:53.870 --> 02:41:53.880 align:start position:0%
that and and because the town was
 
02:41:56.950 --> 02:41:56.960 align:start position:0%
involved but I was really impressed with
 
02:41:59.389 --> 02:41:59.399 align:start position:0%
not only the way the structure of your
 
02:42:02.190 --> 02:42:02.200 align:start position:0%
current policies worked to make sure
 
02:42:04.150 --> 02:42:04.160 align:start position:0%
that the students got due process but
 
02:42:07.030 --> 02:42:07.040 align:start position:0%
with the results as well but she even
 
02:42:09.590 --> 02:42:09.600 align:start position:0%
went beyond that she formed a a
 
02:42:11.830 --> 02:42:11.840 align:start position:0%
committee in of towns people and others
 
02:42:14.710 --> 02:42:14.720 align:start position:0%
to make sure that due process was
 
02:42:16.870 --> 02:42:16.880 align:start position:0%
followed and now there's a report as
 
02:42:19.429 --> 02:42:19.439 align:start position:0%
you've seen it I'm sure and you have too
 
02:42:23.870 --> 02:42:23.880 align:start position:0%
um as I have that outlines
 
02:42:26.630 --> 02:42:26.640 align:start position:0%
um what happened and what the situation
 
02:42:29.070 --> 02:42:29.080 align:start position:0%
was and how we might look at it and so
 
02:42:31.790 --> 02:42:31.800 align:start position:0%
forth but my impression was that this
 
02:42:35.950 --> 02:42:35.960 align:start position:0%
was a serious test of your due process
 
02:42:39.389 --> 02:42:39.399 align:start position:0%
structure and and it it is survived and
 
02:42:42.269 --> 02:42:42.279 align:start position:0%
it was in place and it was utilized am I
 
02:42:43.230 --> 02:42:43.240 align:start position:0%
right in
 
02:42:46.950 --> 02:42:46.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:49.190 --> 02:42:49.200 align:start position:0%
representative for the questions
 
02:42:52.150 --> 02:42:52.160 align:start position:0%
representative uh spb and then represent
 
02:42:55.030 --> 02:42:55.040 align:start position:0%
luno then represent
 
02:42:58.710 --> 02:42:58.720 align:start position:0%
papovich so there's an extensive list of
 
02:43:01.510 --> 02:43:01.520 align:start position:0%
Rights they they tend to mimic uh the
 
02:43:04.550 --> 02:43:04.560 align:start position:0%
fifth and sixth amendment protections as
 
02:43:06.630 --> 02:43:06.640 align:start position:0%
interpreted by the Supreme
 
02:43:10.830 --> 02:43:10.840 align:start position:0%
Court you've specifically identified
 
02:43:14.150 --> 02:43:14.160 align:start position:0%
ways in which you think B on the
 
02:43:14.160 --> 02:43:15.870 align:start position:0%
ways in which you think B on the
document

02:43:15.870 --> 02:43:15.880 align:start position:0%
document
 
02:43:20.389 --> 02:43:20.399 align:start position:0%
sharing and uh D on on excuse me and E
 
02:43:20.399 --> 02:43:22.150 align:start position:0%
sharing and uh D on on excuse me and E
on

02:43:22.150 --> 02:43:22.160 align:start position:0%
on
 
02:43:24.230 --> 02:43:24.240 align:start position:0%
cross-examination might go a little too
 
02:43:27.309 --> 02:43:27.319 align:start position:0%
far if we if we were to examine what
 
02:43:30.070 --> 02:43:30.080 align:start position:0%
that problem is and make an amendment
 
02:43:32.670 --> 02:43:32.680 align:start position:0%
that limited that language would that
 
02:43:35.190 --> 02:43:35.200 align:start position:0%
overcome all of your objections or do
 
02:43:36.830 --> 02:43:36.840 align:start position:0%
you have any objection to any of the
 
02:43:40.269 --> 02:43:40.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:43.950 --> 02:43:43.960 align:start position:0%
here representative I I don't h i don't
 
02:43:48.030 --> 02:43:48.040 align:start position:0%
take exception to B folks having basic
 
02:43:51.190 --> 02:43:51.200 align:start position:0%
rights we I I'm confident that our due
 
02:43:55.030 --> 02:43:55.040 align:start position:0%
process framework allows for that um but
 
02:43:57.429 --> 02:43:57.439 align:start position:0%
I mean specifically as articulated in
 
02:44:00.230 --> 02:44:00.240 align:start position:0%
this bill would that alleviate your
 
02:44:02.389 --> 02:44:02.399 align:start position:0%
objection to the
 
02:44:07.950 --> 02:44:07.960 align:start position:0%
bill I would have to as has as has been
 
02:44:10.230 --> 02:44:10.240 align:start position:0%
requested need to revisit the fiscal
 
02:44:12.710 --> 02:44:12.720 align:start position:0%
note but I have to think about that
 
02:44:15.309 --> 02:44:15.319 align:start position:0%
representa spillsbury what what's any
 
02:44:15.319 --> 02:44:17.230 align:start position:0%
representa spillsbury what what's any
additional

02:44:17.230 --> 02:44:17.240 align:start position:0%
additional
 
02:44:21.309 --> 02:44:21.319 align:start position:0%
cost and I would take a objection so let
 
02:44:22.710 --> 02:44:22.720 align:start position:0%
I need to think
 
02:44:26.309 --> 02:44:26.319 align:start position:0%
about the cost versus
 
02:44:33.150 --> 02:44:33.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:35.750 --> 02:44:35.760 align:start position:0%
language okay uh represent
 
02:44:38.389 --> 02:44:38.399 align:start position:0%
luno thank you very much Mr chair and
 
02:44:40.349 --> 02:44:40.359 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for taking um taking
 
02:44:43.910 --> 02:44:43.920 align:start position:0%
a question um how do your um actually um
 
02:44:46.830 --> 02:44:46.840 align:start position:0%
representative Lynn um referred to your
 
02:44:50.150 --> 02:44:50.160 align:start position:0%
your current um policies several times
 
02:44:52.269 --> 02:44:52.279 align:start position:0%
during his bill introduction and I was
 
02:44:53.950 --> 02:44:53.960 align:start position:0%
wondering if you could uh talk to us a
 
02:44:56.990 --> 02:44:57.000 align:start position:0%
little bit about how your current um
 
02:44:59.590 --> 02:44:59.600 align:start position:0%
policies and practices work when there's
 
02:45:03.429 --> 02:45:03.439 align:start position:0%
an imbalance of power between the um um
 
02:45:06.190 --> 02:45:06.200 align:start position:0%
the the the parties you know allegedly
 
02:45:09.230 --> 02:45:09.240 align:start position:0%
involved um in this and and for an
 
02:45:11.469 --> 02:45:11.479 align:start position:0%
example of a imbalance and power you
 
02:45:15.030 --> 02:45:15.040 align:start position:0%
know think like faculty and

the University Systems general counsel
 
02:45:24.910 --> 02:45:24.920 align:start position:0%
Chad pimel this is exactly why I asked
 
02:45:27.349 --> 02:45:27.359 align:start position:0%
him to join because he knows the
 
02:45:30.269 --> 02:45:30.279 align:start position:0%
specifics of the various policies and
 
02:45:32.910 --> 02:45:32.920 align:start position:0%
practices we have I'm happy to say this
 
02:45:36.030 --> 02:45:36.040 align:start position:0%

represent
 
02:45:51.590 --> 02:45:51.600 align:start position:0%
Mr chair in the order in the interest of
 
02:45:53.510 --> 02:45:53.520 align:start position:0%
Saving Time could I point out that I
 
02:45:55.230 --> 02:45:55.240 align:start position:0%
have two very quick questions on two
 
02:45:56.710 --> 02:45:56.720 align:start position:0%
different paragraphs and that's all I
 
02:45:58.389 --> 02:45:58.399 align:start position:0%
have I I don't want to create the
 
02:46:00.230 --> 02:46:00.240 align:start position:0%
impression that I'm trying to get
 
02:46:02.670 --> 02:46:02.680 align:start position:0%
additional questions here the first
 
02:46:04.950 --> 02:46:04.960 align:start position:0%
question is on your um first page or
 
02:46:07.070 --> 02:46:07.080 align:start position:0%
saying that the title 9 standard states
 
02:46:09.150 --> 02:46:09.160 align:start position:0%
that you may be provided access but not
 
02:46:12.990 --> 02:46:13.000 align:start position:0%
the actual copies obviously Title 9 has
 
02:46:15.429 --> 02:46:15.439 align:start position:0%
35 words none of which says that would
 
02:46:17.110 --> 02:46:17.120 align:start position:0%
you be so kind and share with the
 
02:46:19.070 --> 02:46:19.080 align:start position:0%
committee later after the the
 
02:46:21.230 --> 02:46:21.240 align:start position:0%
testimonies over the specific part of
 
02:46:24.269 --> 02:46:24.279 align:start position:0%
the title 9 guidelines or regulations
 
02:46:26.309 --> 02:46:26.319 align:start position:0%
that are changing every time the
 
02:46:28.950 --> 02:46:28.960 align:start position:0%
presidential office changes hands and
 
02:46:30.830 --> 02:46:30.840 align:start position:0%
would you also be so kind when you do
 
02:46:34.030 --> 02:46:34.040 align:start position:0%
that tell me whether that interpretation
 
02:46:36.550 --> 02:46:36.560 align:start position:0%
is consistent or is it something that
 
02:46:38.870 --> 02:46:38.880 align:start position:0%
changes every time when the you know
 
02:46:40.990 --> 02:46:41.000 align:start position:0%
depending on the party that has the
 
02:46:43.190 --> 02:46:43.200 align:start position:0%
presidential office because we have at
 
02:46:45.110 --> 02:46:45.120 align:start position:0%
least 12 years of history between the
 
02:46:46.830 --> 02:46:46.840 align:start position:0%
last three presidencies and my
 
02:46:48.349 --> 02:46:48.359 align:start position:0%
recollection is that the guidelines were
 
02:46:50.990 --> 02:46:51.000 align:start position:0%
extremely different so this is more of a
 
02:46:52.950 --> 02:46:52.960 align:start position:0%
please follow up with a committee
 
02:46:56.030 --> 02:46:56.040 align:start position:0%
question the other question I have and
 
02:46:58.349 --> 02:46:58.359 align:start position:0%
that's again very short in the next
 
02:47:01.030 --> 02:47:01.040 align:start position:0%
paragraph top of the second page of your
 
02:47:03.349 --> 02:47:03.359 align:start position:0%
testimony there is concern about
 
02:47:05.190 --> 02:47:05.200 align:start position:0%
students accused of sexual assault could
 
02:47:06.790 --> 02:47:06.800 align:start position:0%
directly confront and question the
 
02:47:10.510 --> 02:47:10.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:13.150 --> 02:47:13.160 align:start position:0%
Survivor there should be a presumption
 
02:47:15.190 --> 02:47:15.200 align:start position:0%
of innocence right I would have expected
 
02:47:18.990 --> 02:47:19.000 align:start position:0%
to see the alleged victim or Survivor
 
02:47:21.150 --> 02:47:21.160 align:start position:0%
that language seems to imply to me a
 
02:47:24.630 --> 02:47:24.640 align:start position:0%
very lack of presumption of innocence
 
02:47:27.030 --> 02:47:27.040 align:start position:0%
when we are saying that before anything
 
02:47:29.429 --> 02:47:29.439 align:start position:0%
has been adjudicated somebody's already
 
02:47:32.190 --> 02:47:32.200 align:start position:0%
a purp and somebody's already a victim I
 
02:47:36.510 --> 02:47:36.520 align:start position:0%
would just again like you to think
 
02:47:39.870 --> 02:47:39.880 align:start position:0%
about the testimony you put here and the
 
02:47:42.030 --> 02:47:42.040 align:start position:0%
impression it causes on the committee
 
02:47:44.550 --> 02:47:44.560 align:start position:0%
because you know those are allegations
 
02:47:46.150 --> 02:47:46.160 align:start position:0%
they are very serious allegation that
 
02:47:48.230 --> 02:47:48.240 align:start position:0%
should be investigated it doesn't mean
 
02:47:49.870 --> 02:47:49.880 align:start position:0%
that we stop stop taking any measures
 
02:47:52.550 --> 02:47:52.560 align:start position:0%
until guilt has been established but
 
02:47:55.590 --> 02:47:55.600 align:start position:0%
again that language seems to be a bit U
 
02:47:57.429 --> 02:47:57.439 align:start position:0%
presuming that facts have already been
 
02:47:59.190 --> 02:47:59.200 align:start position:0%
established at the time when it hasn't
 
02:48:01.950 --> 02:48:01.960 align:start position:0%
so thank you repat I would appreciate it
 
02:48:05.429 --> 02:48:05.439 align:start position:0%
thank you mire thank you Mr chairman
 
02:48:09.670 --> 02:48:09.680 align:start position:0%
thank you um Chancellor um how roughly
 
02:48:13.670 --> 02:48:13.680 align:start position:0%
how many um disciplinary proceedings
 
02:48:15.590 --> 02:48:15.600 align:start position:0%
that are more than just somebody having
 
02:48:18.790 --> 02:48:18.800 align:start position:0%
a conversation with some official uh
 
02:48:20.830 --> 02:48:20.840 align:start position:0%
take place annually in these three
 
02:48:22.990 --> 02:48:23.000 align:start position:0%
categories students student organization
 
02:48:26.910 --> 02:48:26.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:29.110 --> 02:48:29.120 align:start position:0%
member I'll have to get back to you
 
02:48:31.510 --> 02:48:31.520 align:start position:0%
representative and I will and maybe a
 
02:48:34.269 --> 02:48:34.279 align:start position:0%
little historical numbers certainly yeah
 
02:48:34.279 --> 02:48:35.630 align:start position:0%
little historical numbers certainly yeah
thank

02:48:35.630 --> 02:48:35.640 align:start position:0%
thank
 
02:48:38.349 --> 02:48:38.359 align:start position:0%
you I I do have one question I'd like to
 
02:48:43.230 --> 02:48:43.240 align:start position:0%
follow up on uh or it's a new area um I
 
02:48:45.309 --> 02:48:45.319 align:start position:0%
went through years ago when I first got
 
02:48:47.150 --> 02:48:47.160 align:start position:0%
in here dealing with situations
 
02:48:49.070 --> 02:48:49.080 align:start position:0%
occurring at another large private
 
02:48:50.750 --> 02:48:50.760 align:start position:0%
school in the
 
02:48:53.910 --> 02:48:53.920 align:start position:0%
state um and we had work with the county
 
02:48:58.790 --> 02:48:58.800 align:start position:0%
attorney on that uh when do you because
 
02:49:02.790 --> 02:49:02.800 align:start position:0%
you have a police force with Jim Dean on
 
02:49:06.389 --> 02:49:06.399 align:start position:0%
campus when does an
 
02:49:08.990 --> 02:49:09.000 align:start position:0%
accusation or where we get into this
 
02:49:10.990 --> 02:49:11.000 align:start position:0%
business of due process
 
02:49:15.110 --> 02:49:15.120 align:start position:0%
rights when does local Authority being
 
02:49:18.150 --> 02:49:18.160 align:start position:0%
Jim Dean or maybe the Durham Police get
 
02:49:20.710 --> 02:49:20.720 align:start position:0%
involved or notified we have something
 
02:49:23.590 --> 02:49:23.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:25.910 --> 02:49:25.920 align:start position:0%
here representative I think that would
 
02:49:29.790 --> 02:49:29.800 align:start position:0%
likely depend on the situation certainly
 
02:49:32.469 --> 02:49:32.479 align:start position:0%
if we think it's something somebody's
 
02:49:34.590 --> 02:49:34.600 align:start position:0%
ilal I'll take a light one they're drunk
 
02:49:36.190 --> 02:49:36.200 align:start position:0%
and they're un
 
02:49:40.349 --> 02:49:40.359 align:start position:0%
underage the unpd would be
 
02:49:43.190 --> 02:49:43.200 align:start position:0%
called and just just for your your own
 
02:49:45.830 --> 02:49:45.840 align:start position:0%
information all of the authority of the
 
02:49:48.229 --> 02:49:48.239 align:start position:0%
UNH Police Department flows from the
 
02:49:50.510 --> 02:49:50.520 align:start position:0%
town Durham yes Police
 
02:49:52.870 --> 02:49:52.880 align:start position:0%
Department because that would be
 
02:49:55.510 --> 02:49:55.520 align:start position:0%
illegal an underage someone's drinking
 
02:49:58.630 --> 02:49:58.640 align:start position:0%
underage so the UN police would likely
 
02:50:01.910 --> 02:50:01.920 align:start position:0%
be called some somebody would call them
 
02:50:06.309 --> 02:50:06.319 align:start position:0%
that that um there are due process
 
02:50:08.590 --> 02:50:08.600 align:start position:0%
policies and procedures but in as Lauren
 
02:50:10.269 --> 02:50:10.279 align:start position:0%
mentioned in all likelihood if it's
 
02:50:11.790 --> 02:50:11.800 align:start position:0%
their first offense there would be a
 
02:50:14.070 --> 02:50:14.080 align:start position:0%
warning and the student would be asked
 
02:50:18.830 --> 02:50:18.840 align:start position:0%
to attend um some alcohol and drug so
 
02:50:20.790 --> 02:50:20.800 align:start position:0%
followup question so are there two sets
 
02:50:23.110 --> 02:50:23.120 align:start position:0%
of laws here one for the person that
 
02:50:26.910 --> 02:50:26.920 align:start position:0%
lives in Durham that's not a student at
 
02:50:30.990 --> 02:50:31.000 align:start position:0%
UNH the UNH student then has a hearing
 
02:50:33.790 --> 02:50:33.800 align:start position:0%
before the college with controlled by
 
02:50:36.670 --> 02:50:36.680 align:start position:0%
the college but the other person's going
 
02:50:38.389 --> 02:50:38.399 align:start position:0%
to have to have that hearing through
 
02:50:38.399 --> 02:50:39.990 align:start position:0%
to have to have that hearing through
civil

02:50:39.990 --> 02:50:40.000 align:start position:0%
civil
 
02:50:41.910 --> 02:50:41.920 align:start position:0%
Authority that's
 
02:50:44.910 --> 02:50:44.920 align:start position:0%
right the you I don't believe the UNH
 
02:50:46.550 --> 02:50:46.560 align:start position:0%
police department has authority to
 
02:50:50.950 --> 02:50:50.960 align:start position:0%
arrest Durham residents yeah
 
02:50:54.150 --> 02:50:54.160 align:start position:0%
okay represent Mahan yeah I just want a
 
02:50:56.469 --> 02:50:56.479 align:start position:0%
clarification on the bottom paragraph on
 
02:50:58.990 --> 02:50:59.000 align:start position:0%
page two in your testimony you say
 
02:51:01.309 --> 02:51:01.319 align:start position:0%
specifically it would require a full
 
02:51:06.269 --> 02:51:06.279 align:start position:0%
trial and appeal process and yet on um
 
02:51:08.269 --> 02:51:08.279 align:start position:0%
on paragraph five the first paragraph on
 
02:51:10.269 --> 02:51:10.279 align:start position:0%
the top of page two in the law itself it
 
02:51:13.030 --> 02:51:13.040 align:start position:0%
says in all disciplinary proceedings
 
02:51:14.750 --> 02:51:14.760 align:start position:0%
against a student student organization
 
02:51:18.309 --> 02:51:18.319 align:start position:0%
or faculty member they shall be entitled
 
02:51:20.229 --> 02:51:20.239 align:start position:0%
to to a hearing are you suggesting that
 
02:51:22.469 --> 02:51:22.479 align:start position:0%
being entitled to a hearing is a
 
02:51:22.479 --> 02:51:24.030 align:start position:0%
being entitled to a hearing is a
requirement

02:51:24.030 --> 02:51:24.040 align:start position:0%
requirement
 
02:51:27.710 --> 02:51:27.720 align:start position:0%
no okay can you
 
02:51:31.950 --> 02:51:31.960 align:start position:0%
explain as representative Lyn mentioned
 
02:51:34.550 --> 02:51:34.560 align:start position:0%
um a student student organization or
 
02:51:39.110 --> 02:51:39.120 align:start position:0%
faculty member could wave their their um
 
02:51:43.150 --> 02:51:43.160 align:start position:0%
right to a hearing yes but I'm just
 
02:51:44.670 --> 02:51:44.680 align:start position:0%
trying to clarify why you said it would
 
02:51:46.269 --> 02:51:46.279 align:start position:0%
be a requirement that there would be
 
02:51:48.590 --> 02:51:48.600 align:start position:0%
like a full Pro full tra process I'm
 
02:51:51.429 --> 02:51:51.439 align:start position:0%
sorry just
 
02:51:53.670 --> 02:51:53.680 align:start position:0%

thing you say specifically it's the
 
02:52:03.790 --> 02:52:03.800 align:start position:0%
fourth line down you say specifically it
 
02:52:06.630 --> 02:52:06.640 align:start position:0%
would require a full Tri trial and I'm
 
02:52:08.309 --> 02:52:08.319 align:start position:0%
just wondering where that requirement is
 
02:52:11.309 --> 02:52:11.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:14.790 --> 02:52:14.800 align:start position:0%

that no you're right representative I'd
 
02:52:20.229 --> 02:52:20.239 align:start position:0%
say it it could it it doesn't require

you're absolutely right my apologies
 
02:52:23.910 --> 02:52:23.920 align:start position:0%

02:52:37.710 --> 02:52:37.720 align:start position:0%
the question that arose in our minds
 
02:52:39.190 --> 02:52:39.200 align:start position:0%
about whether it was required or not is
 
02:52:43.590 --> 02:52:43.600 align:start position:0%
if you look uh in K3 Roman 2 um at the
 
02:52:47.030 --> 02:52:47.040 align:start position:0%
very bottom of page two says the
 
02:52:49.070 --> 02:52:49.080 align:start position:0%
procedural rights including the hearing
 
02:52:52.790 --> 02:52:52.800 align:start position:0%
specified above shall be afforded prior
 
02:52:54.190 --> 02:52:54.200 align:start position:0%
to the imposition of discipline now
 
02:52:56.510 --> 02:52:56.520 align:start position:0%
there's also waiver language how you
 
02:52:57.990 --> 02:52:58.000 align:start position:0%
read that together with the you're
 
02:53:00.590 --> 02:53:00.600 align:start position:0%
entitled but not required it's a
 
02:53:02.670 --> 02:53:02.680 align:start position:0%
question but it does say shall be
 
02:53:06.870 --> 02:53:06.880 align:start position:0%
afforded prior to any discipline being
 
02:53:10.429 --> 02:53:10.439 align:start position:0%
imposed thank you are there further
 
02:53:13.710 --> 02:53:13.720 align:start position:0%
questions of the University system yes
 
02:53:16.349 --> 02:53:16.359 align:start position:0%
represent L thank you Mr chair I'd like
 
02:53:19.190 --> 02:53:19.200 align:start position:0%
to go back to um the question I raised
 
02:53:22.030 --> 02:53:22.040 align:start position:0%
earlier about how your um your current
 
02:53:25.910 --> 02:53:25.920 align:start position:0%
uh policies and practices uh work in in
 
02:53:28.110 --> 02:53:28.120 align:start position:0%
situations particularly where you've got
 
02:53:30.150 --> 02:53:30.160 align:start position:0%
an imbalance of power such as with a
 
02:53:34.469 --> 02:53:34.479 align:start position:0%
faculty and student um situation sure so
 
02:53:35.950 --> 02:53:35.960 align:start position:0%
it's probably easier if I work with a
 
02:53:38.550 --> 02:53:38.560 align:start position:0%
specific hypothetical so can I propose
 
02:53:39.710 --> 02:53:39.720 align:start position:0%
one you'll tell me whether it makes
 
02:53:42.590 --> 02:53:42.600 align:start position:0%
sense all right absolutely because the
 
02:53:45.429 --> 02:53:45.439 align:start position:0%
last hypothetical we heard last year or
 
02:53:48.950 --> 02:53:48.960 align:start position:0%
two years ago in this bill was um was uh
 
02:53:51.349 --> 02:53:51.359 align:start position:0%
uh a couple of fraternity Brothers
 
02:53:52.910 --> 02:53:52.920 align:start position:0%
drinking Bud Light outside their
 
02:53:55.110 --> 02:53:55.120 align:start position:0%
fraternity so I'd love to hear more you
 
02:53:56.990 --> 02:53:57.000 align:start position:0%
know something more at some St sure so
 
02:53:58.389 --> 02:53:58.399 align:start position:0%
so to the extent that we have something
 
02:54:01.150 --> 02:54:01.160 align:start position:0%
serious like a a student uh making an
 
02:54:04.269 --> 02:54:04.279 align:start position:0%
allegation of U sexual assault against a
 
02:54:06.550 --> 02:54:06.560 align:start position:0%
faculty member um it would move over
 
02:54:08.950 --> 02:54:08.960 align:start position:0%
under over multiple tracks at once um
 
02:54:10.229 --> 02:54:10.239 align:start position:0%
the the respon the initial response
 
02:54:11.790 --> 02:54:11.800 align:start position:0%
would be governed largely by the federal
 
02:54:14.110 --> 02:54:14.120 align:start position:0%
title n regulations because that's what
 
02:54:16.630 --> 02:54:16.640 align:start position:0%
we're obligated to do um currently
 
02:54:19.710 --> 02:54:19.720 align:start position:0%
what's in force is the 2020 regulations
 
02:54:20.870 --> 02:54:20.880 align:start position:0%
that the Trump Administration
 
02:54:22.790 --> 02:54:22.800 align:start position:0%
promulgated um as representative Lyn
 
02:54:25.190 --> 02:54:25.200 align:start position:0%
sort of highlighted there is a an order
 
02:54:26.670 --> 02:54:26.680 align:start position:0%
that came out of district court and in
 
02:54:29.150 --> 02:54:29.160 align:start position:0%
Kentucky that said the Biden's attempted
 
02:54:31.670 --> 02:54:31.680 align:start position:0%
regulations have no Force so the current
 
02:54:33.269 --> 02:54:33.279 align:start position:0%
state of play is that the Trump
 
02:54:34.910 --> 02:54:34.920 align:start position:0%
administration's regulations are in
 
02:54:36.910 --> 02:54:36.920 align:start position:0%
effect we're sort of assuming that the
 
02:54:38.190 --> 02:54:38.200 align:start position:0%
Trump Administration is not going to
 
02:54:40.150 --> 02:54:40.160 align:start position:0%
appeal that ruling such that the 2020
 
02:54:41.389 --> 02:54:41.399 align:start position:0%
regulations are going to remain in
 
02:54:44.670 --> 02:54:44.680 align:start position:0%
effect um for the foreseeable future um
 
02:54:46.990 --> 02:54:47.000 align:start position:0%
those are complicated they provide for a
 
02:54:49.030 --> 02:54:49.040 align:start position:0%
lot of um initial sort of what call
 
02:54:50.469 --> 02:54:50.479 align:start position:0%
supportive measures for the student to
 
02:54:51.830 --> 02:54:51.840 align:start position:0%
make sure that they minimize contact
 
02:54:53.110 --> 02:54:53.120 align:start position:0%
with that faculty member to make sure
 
02:54:54.630 --> 02:54:54.640 align:start position:0%
they have the academic support they need
 
02:54:57.830 --> 02:54:57.840 align:start position:0%
to progress through class um there's an
 
02:55:00.150 --> 02:55:00.160 align:start position:0%
investigation and a sort of a report a
 
02:55:01.870 --> 02:55:01.880 align:start position:0%
factual report that's created by the the
 
02:55:04.910 --> 02:55:04.920 align:start position:0%
Title Nine um coordinator and the folks
 
02:55:07.710 --> 02:55:07.720 align:start position:0%
who work for them um that report then
 
02:55:10.229 --> 02:55:10.239 align:start position:0%
goes out and feeds into if there's a
 
02:55:11.630 --> 02:55:11.640 align:start position:0%
finding of yes we think there was a
 
02:55:14.110 --> 02:55:14.120 align:start position:0%
problem here into the faculty discipline
 
02:55:15.710 --> 02:55:15.720 align:start position:0%
process and the faculty discipline
 
02:55:17.830 --> 02:55:17.840 align:start position:0%
process is a little different because
 
02:55:19.990 --> 02:55:20.000 align:start position:0%
it's governed by by cbas but let's for
 
02:55:21.750 --> 02:55:21.760 align:start position:0%
this again just for to pick a
 
02:55:24.110 --> 02:55:24.120 align:start position:0%
hypothetical let's say 10e faculty
 
02:55:25.590 --> 02:55:25.600 align:start position:0%
member at the University of New
 
02:55:28.110 --> 02:55:28.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um the next place that report
 
02:55:29.590 --> 02:55:29.600 align:start position:0%
goes if the administration wants to
 
02:55:32.870 --> 02:55:32.880 align:start position:0%
proceed is to a fac a committee made up
 
02:55:34.550 --> 02:55:34.560 align:start position:0%
of Faculty members because the
 
02:55:36.389 --> 02:55:36.399 align:start position:0%
university has shared governance and it
 
02:55:37.710 --> 02:55:37.720 align:start position:0%
means that the faculty are meant to have
 
02:55:40.429 --> 02:55:40.439 align:start position:0%
a voice and so the question of whether
 
02:55:44.150 --> 02:55:44.160 align:start position:0%
or not the faculty member ought to be um
 
02:55:45.950 --> 02:55:45.960 align:start position:0%
suspended terminated whatnot goes to
 
02:55:49.190 --> 02:55:49.200 align:start position:0%
this faculty committee there is an a
 
02:55:51.910 --> 02:55:51.920 align:start position:0%
purposefully informal hearing where the
 
02:55:54.870 --> 02:55:54.880 align:start position:0%
faculty U hears information and
 
02:55:57.750 --> 02:55:57.760 align:start position:0%
basically expresses its Viewpoint to the
 
02:55:59.349 --> 02:55:59.359 align:start position:0%
university president as to whether or
 
02:56:01.950 --> 02:56:01.960 align:start position:0%
not there should be discipline post um
 
02:56:03.510 --> 02:56:03.520 align:start position:0%
the University president then makes that
 
02:56:05.030 --> 02:56:05.040 align:start position:0%
decision as to whether there should be a
 
02:56:07.590 --> 02:56:07.600 align:start position:0%
termination should happen the faculty
 
02:56:09.469 --> 02:56:09.479 align:start position:0%
member in the union then have the right
 
02:56:11.229 --> 02:56:11.239 align:start position:0%
to grieve that and if the grievance goes
 
02:56:12.389 --> 02:56:12.399 align:start position:0%
all the way it ends up in front of
 
02:56:13.830 --> 02:56:13.840 align:start position:0%
arbitration in front of a neutral
 
02:56:17.830 --> 02:56:17.840 align:start position:0%
arbitrator in i i the last one took six
 
02:56:17.840 --> 02:56:19.269 align:start position:0%
arbitrator in i i the last one took six
days

02:56:19.269 --> 02:56:19.279 align:start position:0%
days
 
02:56:22.590 --> 02:56:22.600 align:start position:0%
um so a a a very fome arbitration
 
02:56:25.550 --> 02:56:25.560 align:start position:0%
process um so that's how it it is sort
 
02:56:28.550 --> 02:56:28.560 align:start position:0%
of handled now um I I think one area
 
02:56:31.550 --> 02:56:31.560 align:start position:0%
where that differs from how we
 
02:56:33.550 --> 02:56:33.560 align:start position:0%
understand it would work under this bill
 
02:56:36.590 --> 02:56:36.600 align:start position:0%
is this process of very informal
 
02:56:39.590 --> 02:56:39.600 align:start position:0%
opportunity for the faculty to chime in
 
02:56:41.750 --> 02:56:41.760 align:start position:0%
decision grieve if you don't like it all
 
02:56:43.830 --> 02:56:43.840 align:start position:0%
the way to arbitration gets replaced
 
02:56:47.229 --> 02:56:47.239 align:start position:0%
with in every instance we have
 
02:56:51.309 --> 02:56:51.319 align:start position:0%
internally first this full hearing um
 
02:56:55.309 --> 02:56:55.319 align:start position:0%
and that is increased staff time people
 
02:56:56.910 --> 02:56:56.920 align:start position:0%
having to do other this about another
 
02:56:59.150 --> 02:56:59.160 align:start position:0%
work that's increased lawyer time we
 
02:57:01.950 --> 02:57:01.960 align:start position:0%
don't have an in-house trial lawyer
 
02:57:04.229 --> 02:57:04.239 align:start position:0%
capacity um that's usually outside
 
02:57:05.830 --> 02:57:05.840 align:start position:0%
Council and outside Council cost money
 
02:57:07.229 --> 02:57:07.239 align:start position:0%
which is part of why we think there's
 
02:57:08.590 --> 02:57:08.600 align:start position:0%
still going to be some dollars
 
02:57:11.750 --> 02:57:11.760 align:start position:0%
associated with this if it goes forward
 
02:57:14.590 --> 02:57:14.600 align:start position:0%
um and again this this that process
 
02:57:16.750 --> 02:57:16.760 align:start position:0%
which is get internal to the university
 
02:57:18.429 --> 02:57:18.439 align:start position:0%
there's at least some private
 
02:57:21.469 --> 02:57:21.479 align:start position:0%
protections inherent in Title 9 UM this
 
02:57:23.229 --> 02:57:23.239 align:start position:0%
faculty process is inherently sort of
 
02:57:26.269 --> 02:57:26.279 align:start position:0%
again um you know informal such the
 
02:57:27.630 --> 02:57:27.640 align:start position:0%
people might be more comfortable
 
02:57:29.670 --> 02:57:29.680 align:start position:0%
participating um the arbitration is what
 
02:57:31.349 --> 02:57:31.359 align:start position:0%
the arbitration is if it goes that far
 
02:57:33.030 --> 02:57:33.040 align:start position:0%
but that gets replaced with a process
 
02:57:36.630 --> 02:57:36.640 align:start position:0%
that is more formal more costly and we
 
02:57:38.389 --> 02:57:38.399 align:start position:0%
were read less privacy protective than
 
02:57:41.630 --> 02:57:41.640 align:start position:0%
the one we have now thank you any
 
02:57:41.640 --> 02:57:42.830 align:start position:0%
the one we have now thank you any
further

02:57:42.830 --> 02:57:42.840 align:start position:0%
further
 
02:57:46.030 --> 02:57:46.040 align:start position:0%
questions not seeing any thank you very
 
02:57:48.830 --> 02:57:48.840 align:start position:0%
much Mr chairman yeah I have a question
 
02:57:52.349 --> 02:57:52.359 align:start position:0%
of you MH um this bill is very important
 
02:57:54.309 --> 02:57:54.319 align:start position:0%
do you know when we'll be executing it
 
02:57:56.389 --> 02:57:56.399 align:start position:0%
because I have no idea okay I'd like to
 
02:57:58.550 --> 02:57:58.560 align:start position:0%
do some more research I I have a lot of
 
02:57:59.950 --> 02:57:59.960 align:start position:0%
experience in that none of our bills
 
02:58:01.830 --> 02:58:01.840 align:start position:0%
have been uh scheduled at all at this
 
02:58:03.309 --> 02:58:03.319 align:start position:0%
point in time okay so there'll be plenty
 
02:58:05.429 --> 02:58:05.439 align:start position:0%
of time to do the preliminary research
 
02:58:08.269 --> 02:58:08.279 align:start position:0%
thank you although any bill it's an
 
02:58:10.830 --> 02:58:10.840 align:start position:0%
early bill has a certain date out of
 
02:58:13.710 --> 02:58:13.720 align:start position:0%
here is this an early
 
02:58:17.590 --> 02:58:17.600 align:start position:0%
Bill yes yes this this is an early bill
 
02:58:19.870 --> 02:58:19.880 align:start position:0%
but bet get get at
 
02:58:23.550 --> 02:58:23.560 align:start position:0%
it yeah yeah that's march by the first
 
02:58:25.510 --> 02:58:25.520 align:start position:0%
week of March has be out I was a
 
02:58:27.670 --> 02:58:27.680 align:start position:0%
beneficiary personally of due process at
 
02:58:29.349 --> 02:58:29.359 align:start position:0%
the University okay I have no other pink
 
02:58:31.510 --> 02:58:31.520 align:start position:0%
cards on this one so this uh Committee
 
02:58:33.550 --> 02:58:33.560 align:start position:0%
hearing is closed and we'll start the
 
02:58:47.030 --> 02:58:47.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:47.040 --> 02:59:17.030 align:start position:0%
 
o'clock

02:59:17.030 --> 02:59:17.040 align:start position:0%

03:41:46.030 --> 03:41:46.040 align:start position:0%
bill that we passed asked earlier that
 
03:41:48.309 --> 03:41:48.319 align:start position:0%
is uh now
 
03:41:51.630 --> 03:41:51.640 align:start position:0%
hb12 uh was a bipartisan companion bill
 
03:41:54.750 --> 03:41:54.760 align:start position:0%
to two terms ago to HB 320 which some of
 
03:41:56.950 --> 03:41:56.960 align:start position:0%
you will remember 320 was the high
 
03:41:59.950 --> 03:41:59.960 align:start position:0%
school Civics Assessment
 
03:42:02.590 --> 03:42:02.600 align:start position:0%
bill and uh Governor sonono happily
 
03:42:04.670 --> 03:42:04.680 align:start position:0%
signed that measure 320 the high school
 
03:42:06.950 --> 03:42:06.960 align:start position:0%
Bill we even had a signing
 
03:42:08.870 --> 03:42:08.880 align:start position:0%
ceremony now the high school bill
 
03:42:11.750 --> 03:42:11.760 align:start position:0%
created a graduation requirement on the
 
03:42:13.389 --> 03:42:13.399 align:start position:0%
secondary school
 
03:42:16.910 --> 03:42:16.920 align:start position:0%
level um that students passed the 128
 
03:42:16.920 --> 03:42:18.590 align:start position:0%
level um that students passed the 128
question

03:42:18.590 --> 03:42:18.600 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:42:21.510 --> 03:42:21.520 align:start position:0%
USCIS exam which immigrants need to
 
03:42:25.269 --> 03:42:25.279 align:start position:0%
study on their Pathway to
 
03:42:27.990 --> 03:42:28.000 align:start position:0%
citizenship uh feedback indicates that
 
03:42:31.469 --> 03:42:31.479 align:start position:0%
uh 320 has been uh wildly successful to
 
03:42:34.469 --> 03:42:34.479 align:start position:0%
use a term that's been used a lot lately
 
03:42:38.910 --> 03:42:38.920 align:start position:0%
uh which in providing a solid Universal
 
03:42:42.389 --> 03:42:42.399 align:start position:0%
Foundation of civics knowledge for every
 
03:42:45.189 --> 03:42:45.199 align:start position:0%
student every single high school public
 
03:42:46.590 --> 03:42:46.600 align:start position:0%
high school gradu
 
03:42:48.830 --> 03:42:48.840 align:start position:0%
graduate in fact I just checked with my
 
03:42:51.910 --> 03:42:51.920 align:start position:0%
niece Malia uh who grew up in Denmark
 
03:42:53.870 --> 03:42:53.880 align:start position:0%
and she just took the test here in
 
03:42:56.189 --> 03:42:56.199 align:start position:0%
conquer at conquer High School um she
 
03:42:58.349 --> 03:42:58.359 align:start position:0%
got 126 out of
 
03:43:00.830 --> 03:43:00.840 align:start position:0%
128 of course I asked her about it and I
 
03:43:02.229 --> 03:43:02.239 align:start position:0%
said so how do the students feel about
 
03:43:03.830 --> 03:43:03.840 align:start position:0%
that and they said they they W didn't
 
03:43:06.630 --> 03:43:06.640 align:start position:0%
really like having a test requirement
 
03:43:08.950 --> 03:43:08.960 align:start position:0%
until I took it and after they took it
 
03:43:10.830 --> 03:43:10.840 align:start position:0%
they were glad they took it and believe
 
03:43:12.030 --> 03:43:12.040 align:start position:0%
it or not they recommended that
 
03:43:14.710 --> 03:43:14.720 align:start position:0%
everybody after them also takes it and
 
03:43:16.790 --> 03:43:16.800 align:start position:0%
um no surprise there but I'll also say
 
03:43:19.429 --> 03:43:19.439 align:start position:0%
that parents seem to love the
 
03:43:21.790 --> 03:43:21.800 align:start position:0%
requirement that's in law now the Civics
 
03:43:25.429 --> 03:43:25.439 align:start position:0%
testing requirement parents uh love
 
03:43:28.229 --> 03:43:28.239 align:start position:0%
it the ones that we've heard from uh
 
03:43:31.550 --> 03:43:31.560 align:start position:0%
very much for it so anyway hb12 today a
 
03:43:32.950 --> 03:43:32.960 align:start position:0%
recent report
 
03:43:36.590 --> 03:43:36.600 align:start position:0%
called America's knowledge crisis a
 
03:43:38.110 --> 03:43:38.120 align:start position:0%
survey on Civic
 
03:43:40.790 --> 03:43:40.800 align:start position:0%
literacy found frightening shortfalls in
 
03:43:42.750 --> 03:43:42.760 align:start position:0%
student knowledge of history and how our
 
03:43:42.760 --> 03:43:44.030 align:start position:0%
student knowledge of history and how our
country

03:43:44.030 --> 03:43:44.040 align:start position:0%
country
 
03:43:46.670 --> 03:43:46.680 align:start position:0%
works a poll of over a thousand people
 
03:43:50.149 --> 03:43:50.159 align:start position:0%
mostly college grads found 63% didn't
 
03:43:52.110 --> 03:43:52.120 align:start position:0%
know the term Links of US senators I
 
03:43:53.950 --> 03:43:53.960 align:start position:0%
could go on and on and on and on about
 
03:43:58.990 --> 03:43:59.000 align:start position:0%
all the specific basic civics government
 
03:44:02.910 --> 03:44:02.920 align:start position:0%
history knowledge that people don't have
 
03:44:06.630 --> 03:44:06.640 align:start position:0%
college graduates do not have and that's
 
03:44:08.630 --> 03:44:08.640 align:start position:0%
not okay some people don't care about
 
03:44:10.030 --> 03:44:10.040 align:start position:0%
that or they're not bothered by it many
 
03:44:11.750 --> 03:44:11.760 align:start position:0%
of us are I am that's why we're here
 
03:44:14.070 --> 03:44:14.080 align:start position:0%
that's why I'm here it's not okay that
 
03:44:17.990 --> 03:44:18.000 align:start position:0%
we're graduating uh so many most college
 
03:44:21.309 --> 03:44:21.319 align:start position:0%
graduates who just don't know how our
 
03:44:23.189 --> 03:44:23.199 align:start position:0%
country Works how our government works
 
03:44:26.269 --> 03:44:26.279 align:start position:0%
who our people
 
03:44:28.750 --> 03:44:28.760 align:start position:0%
are numerous other states this is
 
03:44:30.349 --> 03:44:30.359 align:start position:0%
important to i chair a committee and I
 
03:44:31.670 --> 03:44:31.680 align:start position:0%
always ask questions so what are other
 
03:44:33.590 --> 03:44:33.600 align:start position:0%
states doing if if no other state has
 
03:44:35.710 --> 03:44:35.720 align:start position:0%
ever done something that's significant
 
03:44:38.309 --> 03:44:38.319 align:start position:0%
or if if most other states have done
 
03:44:39.790 --> 03:44:39.800 align:start position:0%
something that's significant too and
 
03:44:41.950 --> 03:44:41.960 align:start position:0%
I'll tell you that many other states
 
03:44:43.950 --> 03:44:43.960 align:start position:0%
have implemented this very requirement
 
03:44:46.149 --> 03:44:46.159 align:start position:0%
on their postsecondary
 
03:44:48.590 --> 03:44:48.600 align:start position:0%
schools uh Florida Missouri lately
 
03:44:50.990 --> 03:44:51.000 align:start position:0%
Christy gome just just recently signed
 
03:44:53.630 --> 03:44:53.640 align:start position:0%
South Dakota's version of this bill so
 
03:44:56.830 --> 03:44:56.840 align:start position:0%
this is something that many other states
 
03:44:59.149 --> 03:44:59.159 align:start position:0%
are doing and Beyond the states there
 
03:45:02.950 --> 03:45:02.960 align:start position:0%
are many private colleges who not in a
 
03:45:06.030 --> 03:45:06.040 align:start position:0%
state perview who understand the need
 
03:45:08.149 --> 03:45:08.159 align:start position:0%
for this Purdue
 
03:45:11.670 --> 03:45:11.680 align:start position:0%
University universities like that now
 
03:45:14.510 --> 03:45:14.520 align:start position:0%
have citizenship Civics various versions
 
03:45:16.630 --> 03:45:16.640 align:start position:0%
sometimes is off an assessment so that
 
03:45:18.670 --> 03:45:18.680 align:start position:0%
somebody who graduates from these
 
03:45:21.070 --> 03:45:21.080 align:start position:0%
institutions people know okay they have
 
03:45:25.189 --> 03:45:25.199 align:start position:0%
a some sense of how our country
 
03:45:28.349 --> 03:45:28.359 align:start position:0%
Works uh some folks dismiss the test as
 
03:45:30.590 --> 03:45:30.600 align:start position:0%
factoid It's Quickly forgotten I
 
03:45:32.990 --> 03:45:33.000 align:start position:0%
disagree whether it's multiplication
 
03:45:37.630 --> 03:45:37.640 align:start position:0%
tables or Anatomy or or this uh there's
 
03:45:39.950 --> 03:45:39.960 align:start position:0%
things people need to learn and they
 
03:45:41.389 --> 03:45:41.399 align:start position:0%
need to demonstrate it's why we give
 
03:45:43.389 --> 03:45:43.399 align:start position:0%
driers tests it's why we have bar
 
03:45:44.950 --> 03:45:44.960 align:start position:0%
examinations it's why we have Reg
 
03:45:47.269 --> 03:45:47.279 align:start position:0%
Industries for nursing or Healthcare
 
03:45:49.309 --> 03:45:49.319 align:start position:0%
people testing assessments I know some
 
03:45:53.950 --> 03:45:53.960 align:start position:0%
people hate them I think they're
 
03:45:56.990 --> 03:45:57.000 align:start position:0%
essential whatever the subject may be so
 
03:45:59.790 --> 03:45:59.800 align:start position:0%
again why is it okay to promote the
 
03:46:03.510 --> 03:46:03.520 align:start position:0%
climate awareness but not constitutional
 
03:46:06.590 --> 03:46:06.600 align:start position:0%
awareness so back to two terms ago while
 
03:46:08.950 --> 03:46:08.960 align:start position:0%
the high school Bill 320 sail through
 
03:46:12.110 --> 03:46:12.120 align:start position:0%
through uh this legislature signed by
 
03:46:13.790 --> 03:46:13.800 align:start position:0%
the governor became law the college
 
03:46:15.790 --> 03:46:15.800 align:start position:0%
version 319
 
03:46:15.800 --> 03:46:16.790 align:start position:0%
version 319
also

03:46:16.790 --> 03:46:16.800 align:start position:0%
also
 
03:46:20.309 --> 03:46:20.319 align:start position:0%
passed uh education committee the full
 
03:46:22.070 --> 03:46:22.080 align:start position:0%
education I mean the full legisl the
 
03:46:24.910 --> 03:46:24.920 align:start position:0%
full house uh but by much narrower
 
03:46:27.429 --> 03:46:27.439 align:start position:0%
version there were people back then who
 
03:46:29.189 --> 03:46:29.199 align:start position:0%
had were not comfortable necessarily
 
03:46:30.870 --> 03:46:30.880 align:start position:0%
with applying the same requirement to
 
03:46:33.309 --> 03:46:33.319 align:start position:0%
postsecondary that we did for secondary
 
03:46:36.469 --> 03:46:36.479 align:start position:0%
and we address that so it passed the
 
03:46:37.830 --> 03:46:37.840 align:start position:0%
house went to the senate senate
 
03:46:39.469 --> 03:46:39.479 align:start position:0%
education heard it I introduced it and
 
03:46:41.590 --> 03:46:41.600 align:start position:0%
they kill they voted unanimously to kill
 
03:46:45.590 --> 03:46:45.600 align:start position:0%
it in Senate education okay so I met
 
03:46:47.469 --> 03:46:47.479 align:start position:0%
with the Senators individually to see
 
03:46:50.070 --> 03:46:50.080 align:start position:0%
why they were so spooked and they told
 
03:46:51.950 --> 03:46:51.960 align:start position:0%
me it would be too expensive which was
 
03:46:53.670 --> 03:46:53.680 align:start position:0%
misleading we talked about that and I
 
03:46:55.070 --> 03:46:55.080 align:start position:0%
addressed that we addressed that the
 
03:46:57.469 --> 03:46:57.479 align:start position:0%
sponsors did senators were also told it
 
03:46:59.590 --> 03:46:59.600 align:start position:0%
was not the legislator's business to
 
03:47:01.750 --> 03:47:01.760 align:start position:0%
promote such an assessment and we
 
03:47:02.950 --> 03:47:02.960 align:start position:0%
thought oh
 
03:47:05.830 --> 03:47:05.840 align:start position:0%
contr State legislatures not only have
 
03:47:08.990 --> 03:47:09.000 align:start position:0%
the right this a Civics but the
 
03:47:12.830 --> 03:47:12.840 align:start position:0%
responsibility to care about education
 
03:47:14.870 --> 03:47:14.880 align:start position:0%
not just on the secondary level but post
 
03:47:16.950 --> 03:47:16.960 align:start position:0%
secondary but well particularly public
 
03:47:19.429 --> 03:47:19.439 align:start position:0%
post secondary so we talked to the
 
03:47:21.630 --> 03:47:21.640 align:start position:0%
Senators about that the Senators are
 
03:47:23.550 --> 03:47:23.560 align:start position:0%
also told that was uh you know teaching
 
03:47:25.469 --> 03:47:25.479 align:start position:0%
to the test and again I I just touched
 
03:47:27.670 --> 03:47:27.680 align:start position:0%
on that assessments are important I
 
03:47:30.030 --> 03:47:30.040 align:start position:0%
spent a lot of time in education the
 
03:47:32.950 --> 03:47:32.960 align:start position:0%
teaching to the test argument is often
 
03:47:36.550 --> 03:47:36.560 align:start position:0%
made by folks who just aren't nuts about
 
03:47:38.950 --> 03:47:38.960 align:start position:0%
accountability or assessments uh is I
 
03:47:42.070 --> 03:47:42.080 align:start position:0%
said earlier uh the sponsors think
 
03:47:44.950 --> 03:47:44.960 align:start position:0%
assessments are crucial uh the senator
 
03:47:46.950 --> 03:47:46.960 align:start position:0%
were told it would set a dangerous
 
03:47:49.389 --> 03:47:49.399 align:start position:0%
precedent but we talked about that and
 
03:47:51.429 --> 03:47:51.439 align:start position:0%
the legislature routinely passes
 
03:47:55.070 --> 03:47:55.080 align:start position:0%
measures that uh impact numerous aspects
 
03:47:55.080 --> 03:47:57.550 align:start position:0%
measures that uh impact numerous aspects
of

03:47:57.550 --> 03:47:57.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:00.670 --> 03:48:00.680 align:start position:0%
postsecondary uh in the college version
 
03:48:04.550 --> 03:48:04.560 align:start position:0%
again then and now was in intended to
 
03:48:07.910 --> 03:48:07.920 align:start position:0%
cover gaps especially now the 320 is law
 
03:48:10.670 --> 03:48:10.680 align:start position:0%
the high school bill is law Mo most high
 
03:48:12.790 --> 03:48:12.800 align:start position:0%
school students uh all all all high
 
03:48:15.630 --> 03:48:15.640 align:start position:0%
school grads have passed it so bottom
 
03:48:18.070 --> 03:48:18.080 align:start position:0%
line uh we met with the Senators I met
 
03:48:20.510 --> 03:48:20.520 align:start position:0%
with the Senators addressed all the
 
03:48:22.950 --> 03:48:22.960 align:start position:0%
questions that had spooked them and then
 
03:48:25.750 --> 03:48:25.760 align:start position:0%
they flipped uh good on them you know
 
03:48:28.550 --> 03:48:28.560 align:start position:0%
they listen and they said we made a
 
03:48:30.469 --> 03:48:30.479 align:start position:0%
mistake okay we should have passed this
 
03:48:33.670 --> 03:48:33.680 align:start position:0%
and so they did so they had re-referred
 
03:48:36.510 --> 03:48:36.520 align:start position:0%
it and then they special ordered it uh
 
03:48:39.309 --> 03:48:39.319 align:start position:0%
319 the version identical version to
 
03:48:40.710 --> 03:48:40.720 align:start position:0%
this it went to the full Senate and the
 
03:48:43.950 --> 03:48:43.960 align:start position:0%
full Senate passed it so the sponsors
 
03:48:46.630 --> 03:48:46.640 align:start position:0%
including myself broke out the champagne
 
03:48:50.030 --> 03:48:50.040 align:start position:0%
L literally uh but then we get a message
 
03:48:53.910 --> 03:48:53.920 align:start position:0%
from the governor uhoh uh clearly the
 
03:48:56.950 --> 03:48:56.960 align:start position:0%
same misinformation as we saw it was
 
03:48:59.510 --> 03:48:59.520 align:start position:0%
sent to that spook the Senators was sent
 
03:49:01.229 --> 03:49:01.239 align:start position:0%
to the governor's office to spoke the
 
03:49:02.950 --> 03:49:02.960 align:start position:0%
governor so we set up a meeting with the
 
03:49:05.469 --> 03:49:05.479 align:start position:0%
governor uh had to reschedule it
 
03:49:06.830 --> 03:49:06.840 align:start position:0%
postpone we set up another meeting with
 
03:49:08.910 --> 03:49:08.920 align:start position:0%
the governor had to reschedule it
 
03:49:11.309 --> 03:49:11.319 align:start position:0%
postpone so finally uh we did get into
 
03:49:13.229 --> 03:49:13.239 align:start position:0%
the governor's office at his
 
03:49:16.389 --> 03:49:16.399 align:start position:0%
invitation which is rare most people who
 
03:49:19.269 --> 03:49:19.279 align:start position:0%
have bills vetoed uh they don't get to
 
03:49:20.910 --> 03:49:20.920 align:start position:0%
the governor doesn't invite them in to
 
03:49:23.309 --> 03:49:23.319 align:start position:0%
talk about it so we finally had the
 
03:49:25.630 --> 03:49:25.640 align:start position:0%
meeting Senator Lang time representa
 
03:49:27.189 --> 03:49:27.199 align:start position:0%
Lang accompanied me we had a wonderful
 
03:49:28.910 --> 03:49:28.920 align:start position:0%
meeting with the governor and I we did
 
03:49:30.510 --> 03:49:30.520 align:start position:0%
the same thing with the governor and we
 
03:49:32.070 --> 03:49:32.080 align:start position:0%
did with the Senators and we addressed
 
03:49:33.630 --> 03:49:33.640 align:start position:0%
all the things that it spoke the
 
03:49:36.389 --> 03:49:36.399 align:start position:0%
governor who spoke the governor I don't
 
03:49:38.590 --> 03:49:38.600 align:start position:0%
know probably the same folks who spoke
 
03:49:41.070 --> 03:49:41.080 align:start position:0%
the Senators uh but the governor still
 
03:49:43.950 --> 03:49:43.960 align:start position:0%
vetoed HP 319 and we found out later
 
03:49:45.710 --> 03:49:45.720 align:start position:0%
that when the bill was enrolled the
 
03:49:47.349 --> 03:49:47.359 align:start position:0%
clock started a lot of you know this
 
03:49:49.670 --> 03:49:49.680 align:start position:0%
bill is enrolled you have a time limit
 
03:49:52.349 --> 03:49:52.359 align:start position:0%
so because we had to postpone several
 
03:49:55.229 --> 03:49:55.239 align:start position:0%
times our meeting with the governor uh
 
03:49:57.030 --> 03:49:57.040 align:start position:0%
come to find out find out much later
 
03:49:58.870 --> 03:49:58.880 align:start position:0%
that he'd already made a decision before
 
03:50:01.790 --> 03:50:01.800 align:start position:0%
he met with us he had to uh meet the
 
03:50:04.630 --> 03:50:04.640 align:start position:0%
timeline so and I think this is very
 
03:50:07.670 --> 03:50:07.680 align:start position:0%
important the governor put out an
 
03:50:10.550 --> 03:50:10.560 align:start position:0%
extraordinary social media tweet with a
 
03:50:13.229 --> 03:50:13.239 align:start position:0%
photo of uh Senator Lang and myself and
 
03:50:15.189 --> 03:50:15.199 align:start position:0%
the governor in his office talking about
 
03:50:15.199 --> 03:50:16.229 align:start position:0%
the governor in his office talking about
this

03:50:16.229 --> 03:50:16.239 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:50:19.830 --> 03:50:19.840 align:start position:0%
bill and uh that he V that he vetoed and
 
03:50:21.710 --> 03:50:21.720 align:start position:0%
this is strictly my I'm not speaking
 
03:50:23.189 --> 03:50:23.199 align:start position:0%
this is my interpretation the reason he
 
03:50:24.229 --> 03:50:24.239 align:start position:0%
did that
 
03:50:28.630 --> 03:50:28.640 align:start position:0%
extraordinary post uh of him and us a
 
03:50:30.990 --> 03:50:31.000 align:start position:0%
picture uh saying how great it was that
 
03:50:33.389 --> 03:50:33.399 align:start position:0%
we came in talk about legislation I
 
03:50:36.070 --> 03:50:36.080 align:start position:0%
interpreted that as his way of saying
 
03:50:38.269 --> 03:50:38.279 align:start position:0%
sorry guys you know like we just should
 
03:50:39.229 --> 03:50:39.239 align:start position:0%
have met
 
03:50:43.309 --> 03:50:43.319 align:start position:0%
earlier which brings us to today in h112
 
03:50:46.990 --> 03:50:47.000 align:start position:0%
FN FN stands for f fiscal note this is a
 
03:50:49.469 --> 03:50:49.479 align:start position:0%
fiscal committee and we need to touch on
 
03:50:51.790 --> 03:50:51.800 align:start position:0%
that fiscal note the earlier version of
 
03:50:55.389 --> 03:50:55.399 align:start position:0%
the same bill HB 319 had no fiscal note
 
03:50:58.070 --> 03:50:58.080 align:start position:0%
no FN at all so we put this in again we
 
03:50:59.950 --> 03:50:59.960 align:start position:0%
didn't anticipate the fiscal note that
 
03:51:01.990 --> 03:51:02.000 align:start position:0%
you see attached to
 
03:51:06.189 --> 03:51:06.199 align:start position:0%
hb12 we saw minimal manageable costs
 
03:51:08.750 --> 03:51:08.760 align:start position:0%
associated with giving an online exam
 
03:51:10.429 --> 03:51:10.439 align:start position:0%
every High School in the state gives
 
03:51:10.439 --> 03:51:11.670 align:start position:0%
every High School in the state gives
this

03:51:11.670 --> 03:51:11.680 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:51:15.070 --> 03:51:15.080 align:start position:0%
exam um and
 
03:51:18.349 --> 03:51:18.359 align:start position:0%
I spent 20 years with ccsnh and I spent
 
03:51:21.189 --> 03:51:21.199 align:start position:0%
as a professor and I spent 12 years in
 
03:51:23.550 --> 03:51:23.560 align:start position:0%
PR and I taught grad and undergrad
 
03:51:25.670 --> 03:51:25.680 align:start position:0%
courses with the university system it's
 
03:51:29.630 --> 03:51:29.640 align:start position:0%
thir 32 years in uh in Po in post
 
03:51:31.670 --> 03:51:31.680 align:start position:0%
education almost as much as the uh
 
03:51:34.189 --> 03:51:34.199 align:start position:0%
representative from Durham probably so I
 
03:51:38.710 --> 03:51:38.720 align:start position:0%
know a little bit about colleges and for
 
03:51:39.990 --> 03:51:40.000 align:start position:0%
the community college system in
 
03:51:40.000 --> 03:51:41.269 align:start position:0%
the community college system in
particular

03:51:41.269 --> 03:51:41.279 align:start position:0%
particular
 
03:51:45.389 --> 03:51:45.399 align:start position:0%
93% of of uh community College grads in
 
03:51:47.710 --> 03:51:47.720 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire are from New Hampshire so
 
03:51:49.590 --> 03:51:49.600 align:start position:0%
now that 320 is
 
03:51:53.429 --> 03:51:53.439 align:start position:0%
law uh 93% of the
 
03:51:55.990 --> 03:51:56.000 align:start position:0%
ccsn ccsn students who are from New
 
03:51:58.750 --> 03:51:58.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh recent grads who have
 
03:52:01.870 --> 03:52:01.880 align:start position:0%
already taken this uh so the intent of
 
03:52:04.110 --> 03:52:04.120 align:start position:0%
this particularly for ccsnh is just
 
03:52:06.830 --> 03:52:06.840 align:start position:0%
simply to cover the gaps the older
 
03:52:08.830 --> 03:52:08.840 align:start position:0%
students or the very few out of state
 
03:52:11.229 --> 03:52:11.239 align:start position:0%
students uh who would also take this so
 
03:52:14.590 --> 03:52:14.600 align:start position:0%
that we could say every community
 
03:52:17.590 --> 03:52:17.600 align:start position:0%
College granted has pass this test
 
03:52:21.469 --> 03:52:21.479 align:start position:0%
universally and that matters a
 
03:52:25.990 --> 03:52:26.000 align:start position:0%
lot and the simple fact is that uh as I
 
03:52:27.469 --> 03:52:27.479 align:start position:0%
just said New Hampshire grads have
 
03:52:29.750 --> 03:52:29.760 align:start position:0%
already passed it so hb12 would cover
 
03:52:33.429 --> 03:52:33.439 align:start position:0%
that Gap and we saw this requirement as
 
03:52:36.429 --> 03:52:36.439 align:start position:0%
being relatively easily met not by
 
03:52:39.670 --> 03:52:39.680 align:start position:0%
hiring anybody but by simply putting I
 
03:52:43.349 --> 03:52:43.359 align:start position:0%
know how regist operations work you put
 
03:52:45.710 --> 03:52:45.720 align:start position:0%
the names of the students haven't taken
 
03:52:48.030 --> 03:52:48.040 align:start position:0%
the test into a group you put a link
 
03:52:50.309 --> 03:52:50.319 align:start position:0%
online and then the students take the
 
03:52:53.110 --> 03:52:53.120 align:start position:0%
test online nobody has to correct it
 
03:52:55.349 --> 03:52:55.359 align:start position:0%
they take the test online as many times
 
03:52:57.469 --> 03:52:57.479 align:start position:0%
as they need to to pass it they can take
 
03:53:00.510 --> 03:53:00.520 align:start position:0%
it in their pajamas so we did not see
 
03:53:01.630 --> 03:53:01.640 align:start position:0%
this is an
 
03:53:04.790 --> 03:53:04.800 align:start position:0%
onerous uh expense and that's why the FN
 
03:53:06.349 --> 03:53:06.359 align:start position:0%
was so
 
03:53:12.469 --> 03:53:12.479 align:start position:0%
surprising um so usnh a little different
 
03:53:15.229 --> 03:53:15.239 align:start position:0%
uh the university system has
 
03:53:19.269 --> 03:53:19.279 align:start position:0%
a much higher percentage of folks who go
 
03:53:21.510 --> 03:53:21.520 align:start position:0%
there who are out of state so there'd be
 
03:53:23.870 --> 03:53:23.880 align:start position:0%
more a higher percentage of University
 
03:53:25.670 --> 03:53:25.680 align:start position:0%
system people who would need to take it
 
03:53:27.550 --> 03:53:27.560 align:start position:0%
to get the
 
03:53:29.590 --> 03:53:29.600 align:start position:0%
universality again that's the purpose of
 
03:53:29.600 --> 03:53:30.870 align:start position:0%
universality again that's the purpose of
this

03:53:30.870 --> 03:53:30.880 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:53:35.630 --> 03:53:35.640 align:start position:0%
bill so the the Department of Education
 
03:53:37.910 --> 03:53:37.920 align:start position:0%
has already created an online version
 
03:53:39.630 --> 03:53:39.640 align:start position:0%
which the commissioner offered to share
 
03:53:42.469 --> 03:53:42.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:46.510 --> 03:53:46.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:51.469 --> 03:53:51.479 align:start position:0%
the FN when I saw it I saw that
 
03:53:55.469 --> 03:53:55.479 align:start position:0%
the anticipated a need in order to
 
03:53:57.550 --> 03:53:57.560 align:start position:0%
satisfy the requirement of administering
 
03:54:00.830 --> 03:54:00.840 align:start position:0%
this exam of hiring uh a person at
 
03:54:02.790 --> 03:54:02.800 align:start position:0%
Plymouth a person at Durham a person at
 
03:54:07.590 --> 03:54:07.600 align:start position:0%
can had $130,000 a year to do
 
03:54:11.830 --> 03:54:11.840 align:start position:0%
this I I we were shocked that there was
 
03:54:15.309 --> 03:54:15.319 align:start position:0%
a fiscal note that said this
 
03:54:18.189 --> 03:54:18.199 align:start position:0%
for exam that needs no one to correct it
 
03:54:21.309 --> 03:54:21.319 align:start position:0%
for exam that's already available online
 
03:54:23.910 --> 03:54:23.920 align:start position:0%
um the the fiscal note said the cost
 
03:54:25.790 --> 03:54:25.800 align:start position:0%
could be up to a million
 
03:54:31.030 --> 03:54:31.040 align:start position:0%
dollars again uh a uh we're just looking
 
03:54:32.710 --> 03:54:32.720 align:start position:0%
to give an online test we're not looking
 
03:54:36.229 --> 03:54:36.239 align:start position:0%
for a Manhattan project uh you'll likely
 
03:54:38.349 --> 03:54:38.359 align:start position:0%
hear that of course there are expenses
 
03:54:38.359 --> 03:54:39.389 align:start position:0%
hear that of course there are expenses
it

03:54:39.389 --> 03:54:39.399 align:start position:0%
it
 
03:54:42.950 --> 03:54:42.960 align:start position:0%
expenses uh administrative expenses it
 
03:54:45.389 --> 03:54:45.399 align:start position:0%
we saw the cost as being so marginal
 
03:54:47.309 --> 03:54:47.319 align:start position:0%
there was no need for a fiscal note
 
03:54:49.790 --> 03:54:49.800 align:start position:0%
inevit inevitably there are some pieces
 
03:54:52.710 --> 03:54:52.720 align:start position:0%
that would require some time and maybe
 
03:54:55.550 --> 03:54:55.560 align:start position:0%
minimal expense as we saw it uh the
 
03:54:57.110 --> 03:54:57.120 align:start position:0%
notion that you got to hire all these
 
03:54:58.950 --> 03:54:58.960 align:start position:0%
people and uh spend up to a million
 
03:55:01.910 --> 03:55:01.920 align:start position:0%
dollars uh it just doesn't pass the
 
03:55:05.269 --> 03:55:05.279 align:start position:0%
smell test at all so I'll close by
 
03:55:08.110 --> 03:55:08.120 align:start position:0%
saying that the sponsors get constant
 
03:55:10.830 --> 03:55:10.840 align:start position:0%
Kudos and you you probably have received
 
03:55:15.070 --> 03:55:15.080 align:start position:0%
and will receive uh you know all kinds
 
03:55:17.630 --> 03:55:17.640 align:start position:0%
of uh people who say we want this we
 
03:55:19.830 --> 03:55:19.840 align:start position:0%
need this like the parents of high
 
03:55:22.149 --> 03:55:22.159 align:start position:0%
school kids love it so this this is
 
03:55:24.550 --> 03:55:24.560 align:start position:0%
something that will strengthen the
 
03:55:26.469 --> 03:55:26.479 align:start position:0%
credibility and the value of a
 
03:55:29.550 --> 03:55:29.560 align:start position:0%
postsecondary diploma uh makes makes the
 
03:55:31.990 --> 03:55:32.000 align:start position:0%
degrees more more valuable and and the
 
03:55:34.189 --> 03:55:34.199 align:start position:0%
hundreds of people watching online uh I
 
03:55:37.070 --> 03:55:37.080 align:start position:0%
hope they they understand that I also
 
03:55:40.110 --> 03:55:40.120 align:start position:0%
want to say that a test is not a Panacea
 
03:55:44.870 --> 03:55:44.880 align:start position:0%
to solve the entire crisis of ignorance
 
03:55:47.630 --> 03:55:47.640 align:start position:0%
uh that's out there but it it makes a it
 
03:55:49.510 --> 03:55:49.520 align:start position:0%
can make a big difference we believe
 
03:55:51.590 --> 03:55:51.600 align:start position:0%
that it's it's been proven in other
 
03:55:53.389 --> 03:55:53.399 align:start position:0%
states and we believe it can happen in
 
03:55:55.870 --> 03:55:55.880 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and again we see it as
 
03:55:59.229 --> 03:55:59.239 align:start position:0%
coming down to knowledge versus
 
03:56:02.550 --> 03:56:02.560 align:start position:0%
ignorance and we can keep giving degrees
 
03:56:04.309 --> 03:56:04.319 align:start position:0%
to people who have no idea how their
 
03:56:05.790 --> 03:56:05.800 align:start position:0%
government works and who have little
 
03:56:09.149 --> 03:56:09.159 align:start position:0%
appreciation for their American Heritage
 
03:56:11.389 --> 03:56:11.399 align:start position:0%
or we can do like so many others do and
 
03:56:14.750 --> 03:56:14.760 align:start position:0%
and take this relatively simple modest
 
03:56:18.110 --> 03:56:18.120 align:start position:0%
action relatively and uh guarantee that
 
03:56:20.389 --> 03:56:20.399 align:start position:0%
every college graduate has a solid
 
03:56:24.590 --> 03:56:24.600 align:start position:0%
foundation of uh Civics fundamentals and
 
03:56:27.110 --> 03:56:27.120 align:start position:0%
finally uh I I do want to acknowledge
 
03:56:29.469 --> 03:56:29.479 align:start position:0%
the good folks from both secondary
 
03:56:31.389 --> 03:56:31.399 align:start position:0%
systems the community college system the
 
03:56:33.550 --> 03:56:33.560 align:start position:0%
university system we've had constructive
 
03:56:35.030 --> 03:56:35.040 align:start position:0%
back and forth I know they're sick of
 
03:56:38.030 --> 03:56:38.040 align:start position:0%
getting emails from the likes of me but
 
03:56:41.510 --> 03:56:41.520 align:start position:0%
we care we're doing this because we
 
03:56:43.910 --> 03:56:43.920 align:start position:0%
worry we care and we believe that we can
 
03:56:45.870 --> 03:56:45.880 align:start position:0%
do better we should do better of course
 
03:56:48.950 --> 03:56:48.960 align:start position:0%
that's going to be up to you all um the
 
03:56:51.750 --> 03:56:51.760 align:start position:0%
folks have acknowledged the problem and
 
03:56:53.710 --> 03:56:53.720 align:start position:0%
they've they've indicated they want to
 
03:56:56.189 --> 03:56:56.199 align:start position:0%
work with us to address it and uh I will
 
03:56:58.990 --> 03:56:59.000 align:start position:0%
add that nhpr did a story on this And
 
03:57:01.750 --> 03:57:01.760 align:start position:0%
the reporter included 10 questions from
 
03:57:05.349 --> 03:57:05.359 align:start position:0%
the US CIS test I sent that link to the
 
03:57:08.389 --> 03:57:08.399 align:start position:0%
committee uh it's in my online
 
03:57:10.990 --> 03:57:11.000 align:start position:0%
testimony um one of the chancellors of
 
03:57:13.870 --> 03:57:13.880 align:start position:0%
the two systems I heard uh actually took
 
03:57:16.630 --> 03:57:16.640 align:start position:0%
the test and scored 10 for 10 I won't
 
03:57:18.429 --> 03:57:18.439 align:start position:0%
say which Chancellor it was but that's
 
03:57:21.990 --> 03:57:22.000 align:start position:0%
excellent to which I say uh Bravo Zulo
 
03:57:24.070 --> 03:57:24.080 align:start position:0%
and I I think I saw in line that the uh
 
03:57:26.469 --> 03:57:26.479 align:start position:0%
representative from Durham perhaps also
 
03:57:28.830 --> 03:57:28.840 align:start position:0%
took that same assessment and also got
 
03:57:33.070 --> 03:57:33.080 align:start position:0%
10 for 10 uh and I say Bravo there as
 
03:57:35.510 --> 03:57:35.520 align:start position:0%
well thank you for your patience and for
 
03:57:37.750 --> 03:57:37.760 align:start position:0%
hearing us out hearing me out and be
 
03:57:39.469 --> 03:57:39.479 align:start position:0%
happy to try to respond to any questions
 
03:57:41.790 --> 03:57:41.800 align:start position:0%
if there are any thank you very much uh
 
03:57:43.710 --> 03:57:43.720 align:start position:0%
representative and I'm going to ask one
 
03:57:45.149 --> 03:57:45.159 align:start position:0%
question for first thing I may have to
 
03:57:47.590 --> 03:57:47.600 align:start position:0%
run out of here too for another hearing
 
03:57:49.590 --> 03:57:49.600 align:start position:0%
um regarding the community college
 
03:57:53.750 --> 03:57:53.760 align:start position:0%
system we have many students uh a vast
 
03:57:56.590 --> 03:57:56.600 align:start position:0%
many that are adults which are coming
 
03:57:58.070 --> 03:57:58.080 align:start position:0%
back for
 
03:58:03.070 --> 03:58:03.080 align:start position:0%
a uh not a four a two-year degree but
 
03:58:06.710 --> 03:58:06.720 align:start position:0%
maybe certification in a career field
 
03:58:09.309 --> 03:58:09.319 align:start position:0%
are they going to be
 
03:58:12.870 --> 03:58:12.880 align:start position:0%
required uh before they get that
 
03:58:16.229 --> 03:58:16.239 align:start position:0%
certificate uh in the trades area to
 
03:58:18.790 --> 03:58:18.800 align:start position:0%
take this if they're there just for like
 
03:58:21.269 --> 03:58:21.279 align:start position:0%
say one semester sure thank you Mr
 
03:58:22.550 --> 03:58:22.560 align:start position:0%
chairman great question is one that
 
03:58:24.309 --> 03:58:24.319 align:start position:0%
we've already talked about I mentioned
 
03:58:26.429 --> 03:58:26.439 align:start position:0%
we've been in touch with postsecondary
 
03:58:28.750 --> 03:58:28.760 align:start position:0%
and uh if it's not clear you have the
 
03:58:30.070 --> 03:58:30.080 align:start position:0%
the measure you can make that clear and
 
03:58:33.710 --> 03:58:33.720 align:start position:0%
language our our desire is for degrees
 
03:58:35.309 --> 03:58:35.319 align:start position:0%
people who get degrees to have taken
 
03:58:37.710 --> 03:58:37.720 align:start position:0%
this exam again I spent 20 years in the
 
03:58:39.830 --> 03:58:39.840 align:start position:0%
community call system yes there are many
 
03:58:41.790 --> 03:58:41.800 align:start position:0%
folks who who take just a course or they
 
03:58:43.790 --> 03:58:43.800 align:start position:0%
take a certificate and it would be great
 
03:58:46.550 --> 03:58:46.560 align:start position:0%
if did take it but no we don't ex we are
 
03:58:48.149 --> 03:58:48.159 align:start position:0%
not looking for that to be a mandate
 
03:58:50.590 --> 03:58:50.600 align:start position:0%
only for degree programs so it's your
 
03:58:53.990 --> 03:58:54.000 align:start position:0%
intent that this will not be covering
 
03:58:56.309 --> 03:58:56.319 align:start position:0%
something right we're fine with with
 
03:58:58.229 --> 03:58:58.239 align:start position:0%
clear making it clear that it's strictly
 
03:59:00.990 --> 03:59:01.000 align:start position:0%
for degree programs not certificate or
 
03:59:02.910 --> 03:59:02.920 align:start position:0%
otherwise further questions from the
 
03:59:05.750 --> 03:59:05.760 align:start position:0%
committee representative uh spillsbury
 
03:59:08.670 --> 03:59:08.680 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman can you tell me
 
03:59:10.910 --> 03:59:10.920 align:start position:0%
the rationale for exempting exchange
 
03:59:13.590 --> 03:59:13.600 align:start position:0%
students in foreign Nationals sure the
 
03:59:14.710 --> 03:59:14.720 align:start position:0%
question was
 
03:59:17.149 --> 03:59:17.159 align:start position:0%
uh with regard to exempting foreign
 
03:59:20.149 --> 03:59:20.159 align:start position:0%
Nationals uh my personal preference
 
03:59:22.750 --> 03:59:22.760 align:start position:0%
would be uh to have foreign Nationals
 
03:59:26.309 --> 03:59:26.319 align:start position:0%
required to take this um I mentioned my
 
03:59:30.070 --> 03:59:30.080 align:start position:0%
uh my niece was from Denmark um when we
 
03:59:31.950 --> 03:59:31.960 align:start position:0%
put this together two terms ago that was
 
03:59:35.030 --> 03:59:35.040 align:start position:0%
a compromise that we made uh there were
 
03:59:37.110 --> 03:59:37.120 align:start position:0%
some folks who could not and would not
 
03:59:40.030 --> 03:59:40.040 align:start position:0%
support this measure if we imposed it on
 
03:59:43.189 --> 03:59:43.199 align:start position:0%
foreign Nationals and so uh the language
 
03:59:45.110 --> 03:59:45.120 align:start position:0%
that we put in three 319 which you see
 
03:59:47.750 --> 03:59:47.760 align:start position:0%
again here today in 112 Exempted foreign
 
03:59:50.229 --> 03:59:50.239 align:start position:0%
Nationals uh because it was a compromise
 
03:59:51.990 --> 03:59:52.000 align:start position:0%
to move things forward for the folks who
 
03:59:54.269 --> 03:59:54.279 align:start position:0%
didn't think they should take it as I
 
03:59:57.670 --> 03:59:57.680 align:start position:0%
just said I I uh I I personally think it
 
03:59:59.429 --> 03:59:59.439 align:start position:0%
would be good for them to take it if if
 
04:00:01.429 --> 04:00:01.439 align:start position:0%
you wanted to make that requirement uh
 
04:00:02.950 --> 04:00:02.960 align:start position:0%
i' have no problem with that but
 
04:00:04.469 --> 04:00:04.479 align:start position:0%
hopefully that answers your
 
04:00:07.750 --> 04:00:07.760 align:start position:0%
question represent papovich thank you Mr
 
04:00:09.309 --> 04:00:09.319 align:start position:0%
chair thank you representative for
 
04:00:13.710 --> 04:00:13.720 align:start position:0%
taking the questions um I'm trying to
 
04:00:17.149 --> 04:00:17.159 align:start position:0%
part the language and the the text of
 
04:00:19.389 --> 04:00:19.399 align:start position:0%
your bill says pass the 128 question
 
04:00:22.070 --> 04:00:22.080 align:start position:0%
2020 version of the exam I looked it
 
04:00:24.149 --> 04:00:24.159 align:start position:0%
online and when it's administered you
 
04:00:27.389 --> 04:00:27.399 align:start position:0%
know in the office it's a 10 or 20
 
04:00:29.830 --> 04:00:29.840 align:start position:0%
question sample and I by the way passed
 
04:00:31.550 --> 04:00:31.560 align:start position:0%
the same my exam when I got my
 
04:00:33.630 --> 04:00:33.640 align:start position:0%
citizenship but that was a while ago and
 
04:00:36.670 --> 04:00:36.680 align:start position:0%
it was before 2020 does
 
04:00:39.510 --> 04:00:39.520 align:start position:0%
this where does this Define the number
 
04:00:41.670 --> 04:00:41.680 align:start position:0%
of questions that will actually be asked
 
04:00:44.189 --> 04:00:44.199 align:start position:0%
right because it says 128 questions that
 
04:00:46.149 --> 04:00:46.159 align:start position:0%
would be a heck of a long exam if we ask
 
04:00:48.750 --> 04:00:48.760 align:start position:0%
all of them sure great question with
 
04:00:50.630 --> 04:00:50.640 align:start position:0%
regard to the numbers of questions on
 
04:00:50.640 --> 04:00:51.349 align:start position:0%
regard to the numbers of questions on
the

04:00:51.349 --> 04:00:51.359 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:00:53.630 --> 04:00:53.640 align:start position:0%
assessment uh as some of you may know it
 
04:00:54.990 --> 04:00:55.000 align:start position:0%
probably you represented more than
 
04:00:57.429 --> 04:00:57.439 align:start position:0%
anyone uh is someone who apparently has
 
04:00:58.950 --> 04:00:58.960 align:start position:0%
gone through the process and have taken
 
04:01:00.830 --> 04:01:00.840 align:start position:0%
the naturalization test the way this
 
04:01:04.070 --> 04:01:04.080 align:start position:0%
works is the prospective uh new citizens
 
04:01:08.550 --> 04:01:08.560 align:start position:0%
have given all these questions U 128 or
 
04:01:11.030 --> 04:01:11.040 align:start position:0%
100 these different versions and they
 
04:01:13.550 --> 04:01:13.560 align:start position:0%
are presumably they study all of them
 
04:01:16.229 --> 04:01:16.239 align:start position:0%
they hopefully learn all those learning
 
04:01:17.830 --> 04:01:17.840 align:start position:0%
objectives or elements and then they're
 
04:01:20.189 --> 04:01:20.199 align:start position:0%
tested orally on 10 of them which they
 
04:01:22.189 --> 04:01:22.199 align:start position:0%
have to get six you Shak in your head
 
04:01:24.429 --> 04:01:24.439 align:start position:0%
that sounds familiar that's what I did
 
04:01:26.590 --> 04:01:26.600 align:start position:0%
in a nice cubicle in a federal building
 
04:01:28.510 --> 04:01:28.520 align:start position:0%
in Boston yeah so you obviously got at
 
04:01:32.309 --> 04:01:32.319 align:start position:0%
least six out of the 10 right um and uh
 
04:01:36.429 --> 04:01:36.439 align:start position:0%
so why 128 okay so there
 
04:01:39.269 --> 04:01:39.279 align:start position:0%
for people who are already citizens and
 
04:01:41.269 --> 04:01:41.279 align:start position:0%
in school whether it's high school or
 
04:01:43.429 --> 04:01:43.439 align:start position:0%
college uh we thought we would have a
 
04:01:46.750 --> 04:01:46.760 align:start position:0%
higher bar than getting six out of 10 uh
 
04:01:49.910 --> 04:01:49.920 align:start position:0%
now there are two exams that are out
 
04:01:52.550 --> 04:01:52.560 align:start position:0%
there there was a 100 question test
 
04:01:55.510 --> 04:01:55.520 align:start position:0%
there was 100 question test and then was
 
04:01:57.309 --> 04:01:57.319 align:start position:0%
ramped up to
 
04:02:01.790 --> 04:02:01.800 align:start position:0%
128 uh in 2020 and then a new
 
04:02:04.429 --> 04:02:04.439 align:start position:0%
Administration came in and they for
 
04:02:06.710 --> 04:02:06.720 align:start position:0%
whatever reason they went back to the
 
04:02:09.710 --> 04:02:09.720 align:start position:0%
easier 100 question test so to be clear
 
04:02:11.910 --> 04:02:11.920 align:start position:0%
we picked the 128 version it's a little
 
04:02:13.429 --> 04:02:13.439 align:start position:0%
more rigorous there's a little more
 
04:02:16.590 --> 04:02:16.600 align:start position:0%
information there to study and to learn
 
04:02:19.950 --> 04:02:19.960 align:start position:0%
and uh we asked in in Statute in its law
 
04:02:25.030 --> 04:02:25.040 align:start position:0%
from 320 that students score 70% on 128
 
04:02:27.790 --> 04:02:27.800 align:start position:0%
questions to to pass so hopefully that
 
04:02:30.309 --> 04:02:30.319 align:start position:0%
answers your question uh so we clearly
 
04:02:33.030 --> 04:02:33.040 align:start position:0%
designated the assessment instrument the
 
04:02:36.389 --> 04:02:36.399 align:start position:0%
the 2020 version 128 questions 70 to
 
04:02:39.630 --> 04:02:39.640 align:start position:0%
pass Mr chair quick followup yes just
 
04:02:41.790 --> 04:02:41.800 align:start position:0%
trying to understand my question was
 
04:02:43.870 --> 04:02:43.880 align:start position:0%
also how many questions will somebody
 
04:02:45.870 --> 04:02:45.880 align:start position:0%
have to answer during the assessment I
 
04:02:48.110 --> 04:02:48.120 align:start position:0%
know it's a pull of 128 questions total
 
04:02:50.750 --> 04:02:50.760 align:start position:0%
I got that right we fig that it's 90s
 
04:02:54.110 --> 04:02:54.120 align:start position:0%
something if if you do the math uh 70%
 
04:02:57.670 --> 04:02:57.680 align:start position:0%
of 128 how many will they have to answer
 
04:03:01.429 --> 04:03:01.439 align:start position:0%
all of them or I see it yes all yes all
 
04:03:05.630 --> 04:03:05.640 align:start position:0%
128 thank you yep uh representative uh
 
04:03:08.590 --> 04:03:08.600 align:start position:0%
luno and then representative m i just
 
04:03:11.349 --> 04:03:11.359 align:start position:0%
real quick no I I want to back and forth
 
04:03:13.590 --> 04:03:13.600 align:start position:0%
between represent luno thank you very
 
04:03:15.990 --> 04:03:16.000 align:start position:0%
much Mr chair and uh thank you very much
 
04:03:18.670 --> 04:03:18.680 align:start position:0%
for taking my question so um so
 
04:03:20.750 --> 04:03:20.760 align:start position:0%
represent mofet you've you've refer
 
04:03:23.469 --> 04:03:23.479 align:start position:0%
referred to the high school version of
 
04:03:26.670 --> 04:03:26.680 align:start position:0%
this as wildly successful and that
 
04:03:28.750 --> 04:03:28.760 align:start position:0%
parents and students love it uh I'm
 
04:03:30.790 --> 04:03:30.800 align:start position:0%
wondering what sort of data you've
 
04:03:34.070 --> 04:03:34.080 align:start position:0%
collected so far that um that talks to
 
04:03:37.389 --> 04:03:37.399 align:start position:0%
that and the efficacy of uh of having
 
04:03:39.710 --> 04:03:39.720 align:start position:0%
this as a graduation requirement exam
 
04:03:41.750 --> 04:03:41.760 align:start position:0%
sure that's great a great question uh
 
04:03:43.429 --> 04:03:43.439 align:start position:0%
it's the answer answer your first
 
04:03:47.389 --> 04:03:47.399 align:start position:0%
question anecdotal um I the folks that
 
04:03:50.349 --> 04:03:50.359 align:start position:0%
I've heard from uh and I've heard from a
 
04:03:53.990 --> 04:03:54.000 align:start position:0%
lot uh like it initially they
 
04:03:56.710 --> 04:03:56.720 align:start position:0%
they did not appreciate having this
 
04:03:58.550 --> 04:03:58.560 align:start position:0%
imposed on them but now that it's out
 
04:04:00.670 --> 04:04:00.680 align:start position:0%
there the feedback I've received
 
04:04:02.510 --> 04:04:02.520 align:start position:0%
anecdotally that we've received is that
 
04:04:04.750 --> 04:04:04.760 align:start position:0%
they uh they're glad they're doing it
 
04:04:06.429 --> 04:04:06.439 align:start position:0%
and they think it makes a difference and
 
04:04:09.189 --> 04:04:09.199 align:start position:0%
the second question was efficacy yeah
 
04:04:12.590 --> 04:04:12.600 align:start position:0%
efficacy meaning meaning you know does
 
04:04:15.790 --> 04:04:15.800 align:start position:0%
does having this as a high school
 
04:04:17.750 --> 04:04:17.760 align:start position:0%
graduation requirement for every high
 
04:04:20.229 --> 04:04:20.239 align:start position:0%
school student um in New Hampshire does
 
04:04:23.870 --> 04:04:23.880 align:start position:0%
it somehow improve our um this test
 
04:04:27.030 --> 04:04:27.040 align:start position:0%
alone does it somehow improve our degree
 
04:04:29.070 --> 04:04:29.080 align:start position:0%
of Civic awareness and um and
 
04:04:32.189 --> 04:04:32.199 align:start position:0%
involvement um among these this cohort
 
04:04:34.189 --> 04:04:34.199 align:start position:0%
of high school grants sure and that's
 
04:04:36.149 --> 04:04:36.159 align:start position:0%
another good question does it does it
 
04:04:37.950 --> 04:04:37.960 align:start position:0%
basically does this test make it
 
04:04:39.910 --> 04:04:39.920 align:start position:0%
difference uh is what I'm hearing and
 
04:04:42.189 --> 04:04:42.199 align:start position:0%
the answer in my view is it makes a huge
 
04:04:44.269 --> 04:04:44.279 align:start position:0%
difference it gets
 
04:04:47.830 --> 04:04:47.840 align:start position:0%
everyone on on uh the same playing field
 
04:04:49.630 --> 04:04:49.640 align:start position:0%
in the sense that there's a universal
 
04:04:53.269 --> 04:04:53.279 align:start position:0%
requirement I I taught Civics in in
 
04:04:55.110 --> 04:04:55.120 align:start position:0%
history and government so obviously it's
 
04:04:59.030 --> 04:04:59.040 align:start position:0%
an area that matters to me and before
 
04:05:01.110 --> 04:05:01.120 align:start position:0%
this test came into place there was a
 
04:05:03.790 --> 04:05:03.800 align:start position:0%
broad spectrum of how schools handled
 
04:05:06.590 --> 04:05:06.600 align:start position:0%
Civic social studies some did much
 
04:05:09.750 --> 04:05:09.760 align:start position:0%
Milford by the way uh reps and patrino I
 
04:05:11.790 --> 04:05:11.800 align:start position:0%
just came from the east from Milford
 
04:05:14.269 --> 04:05:14.279 align:start position:0%
Milford had had a reputation of doing a
 
04:05:17.229 --> 04:05:17.239 align:start position:0%
great job uh with Civics and there are
 
04:05:20.870 --> 04:05:20.880 align:start position:0%
other schools that did uh not much uh
 
04:05:23.110 --> 04:05:23.120 align:start position:0%
some schools did great some school just
 
04:05:25.670 --> 04:05:25.680 align:start position:0%
a wide spectrum and what worried the
 
04:05:28.229 --> 04:05:28.239 align:start position:0%
sponsors like myself of the schools that
 
04:05:30.189 --> 04:05:30.199 align:start position:0%
were were not Milford schools that they
 
04:05:32.870 --> 04:05:32.880 align:start position:0%
didn't teach it at all or or when they
 
04:05:35.189 --> 04:05:35.199 align:start position:0%
did teach it uh they didn't get into
 
04:05:37.309 --> 04:05:37.319 align:start position:0%
fundamentals they they'd have people go
 
04:05:39.910 --> 04:05:39.920 align:start position:0%
to town meeting which is great or or a
 
04:05:41.990 --> 04:05:42.000 align:start position:0%
political thing or whatever and that
 
04:05:44.510 --> 04:05:44.520 align:start position:0%
would be that would satisfy the Civics
 
04:05:48.790 --> 04:05:48.800 align:start position:0%
requirement uh Senator dallis Sandro uh
 
04:05:51.070 --> 04:05:51.080 align:start position:0%
is a longtime friend of mine uh who's
 
04:05:53.510 --> 04:05:53.520 align:start position:0%
also a Civics teacher and when I went to
 
04:05:55.510 --> 04:05:55.520 align:start position:0%
the Senate I wasn't able to ask him on
 
04:05:57.990 --> 04:05:58.000 align:start position:0%
the senate floor but I wanted to say
 
04:06:00.269 --> 04:06:00.279 align:start position:0%
coach uh by the way he recruited me to
 
04:06:03.269 --> 04:06:03.279 align:start position:0%
play basketball at for him 50 years ago
 
04:06:05.830 --> 04:06:05.840 align:start position:0%
so we went way back and I wanted to say
 
04:06:07.950 --> 04:06:07.960 align:start position:0%
coach would you send players out in the
 
04:06:10.510 --> 04:06:10.520 align:start position:0%
court of the field who don't have
 
04:06:12.710 --> 04:06:12.720 align:start position:0%
fundamentals and uh I didn't never get
 
04:06:15.830 --> 04:06:15.840 align:start position:0%
to ask him that question so the value of
 
04:06:18.590 --> 04:06:18.600 align:start position:0%
this is that every student what whether
 
04:06:20.830 --> 04:06:20.840 align:start position:0%
the school does a good job or a poor job
 
04:06:23.070 --> 04:06:23.080 align:start position:0%
with with classes every student has this
 
04:06:26.590 --> 04:06:26.600 align:start position:0%
solid 128 question element Foundation
 
04:06:30.469 --> 04:06:30.479 align:start position:0%
across the board uh and so I think it's
 
04:06:31.710 --> 04:06:31.720 align:start position:0%
been good for every school and every
 
04:06:34.910 --> 04:06:34.920 align:start position:0%
student in my opinion so M Mr chair just
 
04:06:36.389 --> 04:06:36.399 align:start position:0%
re real quickly and follow up on this
 
04:06:38.189 --> 04:06:38.199 align:start position:0%
because we had an earlier earlier
 
04:06:40.469 --> 04:06:40.479 align:start position:0%
question that um that really wanted to
 
04:06:43.110 --> 04:06:43.120 align:start position:0%
drill down on um on what what's the
 
04:06:47.030 --> 04:06:47.040 align:start position:0%
scientific basis behind making um U
 
04:06:49.030 --> 04:06:49.040 align:start position:0%
making such assertions and clearly
 
04:06:51.670 --> 04:06:51.680 align:start position:0%
you've said it's uh it's anecdotal but I
 
04:06:53.389 --> 04:06:53.399 align:start position:0%
think from the little bit of data that
 
04:06:55.469 --> 04:06:55.479 align:start position:0%
I've been able to collect at about 20
 
04:06:58.269 --> 04:06:58.279 align:start position:0%
minutes after one uh there were 11
 
04:06:59.910 --> 04:06:59.920 align:start position:0%
people that signed up to support this
 
04:07:02.630 --> 04:07:02.640 align:start position:0%
bill and 18 signed up to oppose the bill
 
04:07:04.950 --> 04:07:04.960 align:start position:0%
and that doesn't e neither one of those
 
04:07:07.469 --> 04:07:07.479 align:start position:0%
pieces of information sound like it's
 
04:07:09.630 --> 04:07:09.640 align:start position:0%
wildly successful or that parents all
 
04:07:11.830 --> 04:07:11.840 align:start position:0%
over the place love it so just putting
 
04:07:13.670 --> 04:07:13.680 align:start position:0%
it out there for the little bit of
 
04:07:16.429 --> 04:07:16.439 align:start position:0%
actual data we have sure doesn't point
 
04:07:18.590 --> 04:07:18.600 align:start position:0%
in that direction I'm not sure if that
 
04:07:21.349 --> 04:07:21.359 align:start position:0%
sample uh and I did take a grad course
 
04:07:23.070 --> 04:07:23.080 align:start position:0%
in in Ed measurements I don't know if
 
04:07:24.910 --> 04:07:24.920 align:start position:0%
that's a valid sample to make a judgment
 
04:07:26.109 --> 04:07:26.119 align:start position:0%
on but as you know so well
 
04:07:28.429 --> 04:07:28.439 align:start position:0%
representative the uh the signin things
 
04:07:30.870 --> 04:07:30.880 align:start position:0%
matter we look at them uh sometimes they
 
04:07:35.109 --> 04:07:35.119 align:start position:0%
can be uh uh of course 11 and 18 that
 
04:07:36.950 --> 04:07:36.960 align:start position:0%
may change sometimes as you know we'll
 
04:07:38.469 --> 04:07:38.479 align:start position:0%
have hundreds of people from out of
 
04:07:40.510 --> 04:07:40.520 align:start position:0%
state call in and and sign in and check
 
04:07:43.229 --> 04:07:43.239 align:start position:0%
in and support or whatever uh but we
 
04:07:44.429 --> 04:07:44.439 align:start position:0%
still look at them and thank you for
 
04:07:46.469 --> 04:07:46.479 align:start position:0%
sharing those numbers and uh but I
 
04:07:49.149 --> 04:07:49.159 align:start position:0%
wouldn't base the any decisions on uh
 
04:07:52.269 --> 04:07:52.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:56.070 --> 04:07:56.080 align:start position:0%
up it's further further questions
 
04:07:57.469 --> 04:07:57.479 align:start position:0%
representa spillsbury
 
04:08:00.710 --> 04:08:00.720 align:start position:0%
very quickly is it your intent that this
 
04:08:02.870 --> 04:08:02.880 align:start position:0%
applies only to undergraduate degree
 
04:08:06.109 --> 04:08:06.119 align:start position:0%
granning programs or also graduate thank
 
04:08:08.550 --> 04:08:08.560 align:start position:0%
B question undergraduate or graduate the
 
04:08:12.910 --> 04:08:12.920 align:start position:0%
intent is strictly undergraduate and uh
 
04:08:14.910 --> 04:08:14.920 align:start position:0%
most graduate students not all but most
 
04:08:18.269 --> 04:08:18.279 align:start position:0%
of them are from that would have already
 
04:08:19.950 --> 04:08:19.960 align:start position:0%
satisfied the requirement on the high
 
04:08:21.830 --> 04:08:21.840 align:start position:0%
school level and then hopefully on the
 
04:08:25.149 --> 04:08:25.159 align:start position:0%
on the uh associate or borate degree
 
04:08:28.189 --> 04:08:28.199 align:start position:0%
levels uh graduate is not part of the
 
04:08:30.189 --> 04:08:30.199 align:start position:0%
equation here if we wanted to make that
 
04:08:32.469 --> 04:08:32.479 align:start position:0%
clear you would have no objection
 
04:08:32.479 --> 04:08:34.550 align:start position:0%
clear you would have no objection
correct

04:08:34.550 --> 04:08:34.560 align:start position:0%
correct
 
04:08:37.950 --> 04:08:37.960 align:start position:0%
certainly further questions
 
04:08:40.870 --> 04:08:40.880 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chair um I just have a
 
04:08:43.550 --> 04:08:43.560 align:start position:0%
question about the potential cost and
 
04:08:45.469 --> 04:08:45.479 align:start position:0%
and you mentioned that you know we could
 
04:08:47.790 --> 04:08:47.800 align:start position:0%
get the software from the Department of
 
04:08:52.590 --> 04:08:52.600 align:start position:0%
Education um but would you expect any
 
04:08:56.429 --> 04:08:56.439 align:start position:0%
cost in the area of test prep um
 
04:08:58.590 --> 04:08:58.600 align:start position:0%
assistance to students who might have
 
04:09:00.550 --> 04:09:00.560 align:start position:0%
different learning styles or special
 
04:09:05.469 --> 04:09:05.479 align:start position:0%
needs um and then the cost if if kids if
 
04:09:07.830 --> 04:09:07.840 align:start position:0%
the students can't pass the test sure
 
04:09:10.070 --> 04:09:10.080 align:start position:0%
great question I'm glad you asked that
 
04:09:11.710 --> 04:09:11.720 align:start position:0%
uh the initial legislation from two
 
04:09:15.510 --> 04:09:15.520 align:start position:0%
terms ago uh on on the secondary level
 
04:09:19.630 --> 04:09:19.640 align:start position:0%
Exempted or provided for special needs
 
04:09:21.870 --> 04:09:21.880 align:start position:0%
FK folks who or students who had special
 
04:09:24.990 --> 04:09:25.000 align:start position:0%
needs would could take the test uh
 
04:09:28.070 --> 04:09:28.080 align:start position:0%
through a special needs professional to
 
04:09:31.030 --> 04:09:31.040 align:start position:0%
answer that part of it the other part uh
 
04:09:32.750 --> 04:09:32.760 align:start position:0%
before I step away I'm glad you answer
 
04:09:36.429 --> 04:09:36.439 align:start position:0%
that question uh this this is a fiscal
 
04:09:40.429 --> 04:09:40.439 align:start position:0%
uh Financial committee and I've already
 
04:09:44.030 --> 04:09:44.040 align:start position:0%
said that the sponsors did not see this
 
04:09:46.830 --> 04:09:46.840 align:start position:0%
is terribly expensive we're actually
 
04:09:48.670 --> 04:09:48.680 align:start position:0%
surprised that there was a fiscal note
 
04:09:51.189 --> 04:09:51.199 align:start position:0%
we thought that the current registar
 
04:09:54.429 --> 04:09:54.439 align:start position:0%
offices and and the the the many
 
04:09:56.590 --> 04:09:56.600 align:start position:0%
professionals that the institutions
 
04:10:00.349 --> 04:10:00.359 align:start position:0%
employ could e in our view easily absorb
 
04:10:02.309 --> 04:10:02.319 align:start position:0%
this uh would have taken some some
 
04:10:04.109 --> 04:10:04.119 align:start position:0%
measure of time uh we thought it was
 
04:10:06.149 --> 04:10:06.159 align:start position:0%
minimal now I'm sure what you're going
 
04:10:09.389 --> 04:10:09.399 align:start position:0%
to hear uh that there's going to be uh
 
04:10:13.070 --> 04:10:13.080 align:start position:0%
all kinds of it uh requirements it's
 
04:10:15.710 --> 04:10:15.720 align:start position:0%
going to be all kinds of administration
 
04:10:17.990 --> 04:10:18.000 align:start position:0%
time uh I've already mentioned and thank
 
04:10:19.229 --> 04:10:19.239 align:start position:0%
you again for the question I've already
 
04:10:21.630 --> 04:10:21.640 align:start position:0%
mentioned that the fiscal note we think
 
04:10:21.640 --> 04:10:22.830 align:start position:0%
mentioned that the fiscal note we think
is

04:10:22.830 --> 04:10:22.840 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:10:26.950 --> 04:10:26.960 align:start position:0%
wildly uh off uh stun stunningly
 
04:10:29.870 --> 04:10:29.880 align:start position:0%
surprised that that the uh we see no
 
04:10:32.870 --> 04:10:32.880 align:start position:0%
need to hire anybody that you may hear
 
04:10:36.510 --> 04:10:36.520 align:start position:0%
differently uh and I hope that you'll uh
 
04:10:39.630 --> 04:10:39.640 align:start position:0%
listen to whatever testimony you get on
 
04:10:44.389 --> 04:10:44.399 align:start position:0%
the cost and understand that uh
 
04:10:45.710 --> 04:10:45.720 align:start position:0%
you need to be maybe a little bit
 
04:10:47.830 --> 04:10:47.840 align:start position:0%
skeptical that's your job is to look
 
04:10:49.750 --> 04:10:49.760 align:start position:0%
into like represent the representative
 
04:10:51.950 --> 04:10:51.960 align:start position:0%
from Hopkinson just looked online to try
 
04:10:54.750 --> 04:10:54.760 align:start position:0%
to get some numbers uh do some due
 
04:10:56.950 --> 04:10:56.960 align:start position:0%
diligence I'm very dubious about what
 
04:10:58.710 --> 04:10:58.720 align:start position:0%
I've heard what it's in the fiscal Noe
 
04:11:00.670 --> 04:11:00.680 align:start position:0%
and probably what you may hear shortly
 
04:11:03.710 --> 04:11:03.720 align:start position:0%
in terms of the cost and I would also
 
04:11:05.469 --> 04:11:05.479 align:start position:0%
say as I've already said that you know
 
04:11:08.349 --> 04:11:08.359 align:start position:0%
all the high schools do it and so many
 
04:11:10.469 --> 04:11:10.479 align:start position:0%
other states are doing it and that might
 
04:11:12.349 --> 04:11:12.359 align:start position:0%
be a good thing to have some researcher
 
04:11:14.710 --> 04:11:14.720 align:start position:0%
look into you know did it cost a million
 
04:11:17.070 --> 04:11:17.080 align:start position:0%
dollars for South Dakota to do this I
 
04:11:18.750 --> 04:11:18.760 align:start position:0%
don't think so I don't did they have to
 
04:11:22.790 --> 04:11:22.800 align:start position:0%
hire all these $130,000 a year people to
 
04:11:24.870 --> 04:11:24.880 align:start position:0%
uh administer a test that's already been
 
04:11:26.870 --> 04:11:26.880 align:start position:0%
made up already formatted already online
 
04:11:30.790 --> 04:11:30.800 align:start position:0%
that no one has to correct uh I am very
 
04:11:34.229 --> 04:11:34.239 align:start position:0%
dubious about what I've seen and and and
 
04:11:35.830 --> 04:11:35.840 align:start position:0%
I would be very careful about what you
 
04:11:37.630 --> 04:11:37.640 align:start position:0%
may hear in terms of cost the
 
04:11:39.149 --> 04:11:39.159 align:start position:0%
representative does that help a little
 
04:11:39.159 --> 04:11:43.670 align:start position:0%
representative does that help a little
bit

04:11:43.670 --> 04:11:43.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:46.750 --> 04:11:46.760 align:start position:0%
uh represent I have one question for
 
04:11:49.269 --> 04:11:49.279 align:start position:0%
you this is the season in which there's
 
04:11:51.429 --> 04:11:51.439 align:start position:0%
been some real exciting football games
 
04:11:53.790 --> 04:11:53.800 align:start position:0%
and we have the final four coming up on
 
04:11:56.750 --> 04:11:56.760 align:start position:0%
us in another month and students are
 
04:11:58.790 --> 04:11:58.800 align:start position:0%
transferring from one school and now
 
04:12:00.349 --> 04:12:00.359 align:start position:0%
going through the
 
04:12:03.670 --> 04:12:03.680 align:start position:0%
portal uh we have some kids that were
 
04:12:05.990 --> 04:12:06.000 align:start position:0%
playing for Notre Dame or Ohio State
 
04:12:09.070 --> 04:12:09.080 align:start position:0%
which we saw last night um they've been
 
04:12:12.030 --> 04:12:12.040 align:start position:0%
in one of those schools for maybe a
 
04:12:15.349 --> 04:12:15.359 align:start position:0%
semester um are those students that may
 
04:12:17.990 --> 04:12:18.000 align:start position:0%
be receiving that degree from that new
 
04:12:20.750 --> 04:12:20.760 align:start position:0%
school also required to do this to come
 
04:12:23.030 --> 04:12:23.040 align:start position:0%
in for the portal or is that going to
 
04:12:26.030 --> 04:12:26.040 align:start position:0%
impact our athletic programs well thank
 
04:12:28.309 --> 04:12:28.319 align:start position:0%
you for the question Mr chairman uh I am
 
04:12:30.670 --> 04:12:30.680 align:start position:0%
kind of a sports guy as some of you know
 
04:12:32.550 --> 04:12:32.560 align:start position:0%
I actually have a bill into Commerce on
 
04:12:36.309 --> 04:12:36.319 align:start position:0%
the new world uh nil name image and
 
04:12:39.109 --> 04:12:39.119 align:start position:0%
likeness even division 3 students now
 
04:12:41.990 --> 04:12:42.000 align:start position:0%
can sell their likenesses and yes there
 
04:12:44.429 --> 04:12:44.439 align:start position:0%
are college students who are uh
 
04:12:46.389 --> 04:12:46.399 align:start position:0%
transferring from school to school to
 
04:12:49.550 --> 04:12:49.560 align:start position:0%
school uh so the the athletic piece of
 
04:12:52.950 --> 04:12:52.960 align:start position:0%
that is of of interest uh but I think
 
04:12:55.149 --> 04:12:55.159 align:start position:0%
more to the point you're asking about
 
04:12:59.389 --> 04:12:59.399 align:start position:0%
transfers um and again the requirement
 
04:13:03.349 --> 04:13:03.359 align:start position:0%
is uh for any degree you need to pass a
 
04:13:05.990 --> 04:13:06.000 align:start position:0%
test so if somebody comes to whatever
 
04:13:09.189 --> 04:13:09.199 align:start position:0%
institution from what other institution
 
04:13:10.630 --> 04:13:10.640 align:start position:0%
and they haven't taken the test they
 
04:13:12.590 --> 04:13:12.600 align:start position:0%
would need to add their name to the list
 
04:13:15.389 --> 04:13:15.399 align:start position:0%
click on the L link take the test done
 
04:13:17.269 --> 04:13:17.279 align:start position:0%
does does that answer your
 
04:13:21.229 --> 04:13:21.239 align:start position:0%
question yes as you see it yes okay any
 
04:13:23.950 --> 04:13:23.960 align:start position:0%
other uh questions from the committee to
 
04:13:26.990 --> 04:13:27.000 align:start position:0%

distributing some
 
04:14:05.830 --> 04:14:05.840 align:start position:0%
testimony so
 
04:14:09.630 --> 04:14:09.640 align:start position:0%
um yes I will admit I am the
 
04:14:12.429 --> 04:14:12.439 align:start position:0%
chancellor that took the 10 question
 
04:14:15.429 --> 04:14:15.439 align:start position:0%
exam that representative mofet sent sent
 
04:14:19.229 --> 04:14:19.239 align:start position:0%
us one evening um I will also say that
 
04:14:22.109 --> 04:14:22.119 align:start position:0%
that um I agree with representative
 
04:14:25.070 --> 04:14:25.080 align:start position:0%
moffett's statements and intent on the
 
04:14:30.030 --> 04:14:30.040 align:start position:0%
importance of um the citizenry being
 
04:14:31.990 --> 04:14:32.000 align:start position:0%
educated in
 
04:14:35.910 --> 04:14:35.920 align:start position:0%
Civics um however as I mentioned this
 
04:14:39.469 --> 04:14:39.479 align:start position:0%
morning there is a cost to
 
04:14:43.149 --> 04:14:43.159 align:start position:0%
administer the bill it is it is not a a
 
04:14:44.429 --> 04:14:44.439 align:start position:0%
no cost
 
04:14:48.309 --> 04:14:48.319 align:start position:0%
bill um I will I will add that when
 
04:14:51.229 --> 04:14:51.239 align:start position:0%
the last session when this uh I don't
 
04:14:54.269 --> 04:14:54.279 align:start position:0%
remember the bill number uh came forward
 
04:14:56.510 --> 04:14:56.520 align:start position:0%
we were not asked to complete a fiscal
 
04:14:59.830 --> 04:14:59.840 align:start position:0%
note we're we only complete fiscal notes
 
04:15:02.510 --> 04:15:02.520 align:start position:0%
when the legislative budget Assistance
 
04:15:05.750 --> 04:15:05.760 align:start position:0%
Office sends us the request so that's
 
04:15:08.030 --> 04:15:08.040 align:start position:0%
why there wasn't a fiscal note last
 
04:15:11.510 --> 04:15:11.520 align:start position:0%
session um the the other part of the
 
04:15:13.710 --> 04:15:13.720 align:start position:0%
fiscal note and I want address that
 
04:15:16.510 --> 04:15:16.520 align:start position:0%
because um again we've been in
 
04:15:18.389 --> 04:15:18.399 align:start position:0%
communication with representative mofet
 
04:15:20.790 --> 04:15:20.800 align:start position:0%
quite a bit over the last few
 
04:15:23.349 --> 04:15:23.359 align:start position:0%
weeks we know that the Department of
 
04:15:25.269 --> 04:15:25.279 align:start position:0%
Education spent over half a million
 
04:15:28.990 --> 04:15:29.000 align:start position:0%
dollars on its platform and its test at
 
04:15:31.750 --> 04:15:31.760 align:start position:0%
the time we completed the fiscal note we
 
04:15:34.550 --> 04:15:34.560 align:start position:0%
didn't know that the Department of
 
04:15:38.149 --> 04:15:38.159 align:start position:0%
Education test would be available um
 
04:15:39.670 --> 04:15:39.680 align:start position:0%
there's still some question I think we'd
 
04:15:42.149 --> 04:15:42.159 align:start position:0%
need to to there's still some dialogue
 
04:15:43.630 --> 04:15:43.640 align:start position:0%
happening between the Department of
 
04:15:46.229 --> 04:15:46.239 align:start position:0%
Education ccsnh and usnh on how that
 
04:15:48.149 --> 04:15:48.159 align:start position:0%
would work because it's a third-party
 
04:15:51.469 --> 04:15:51.479 align:start position:0%
vendor um so so there's still some
 
04:15:51.479 --> 04:15:52.870 align:start position:0%
vendor um so so there's still some
question

04:15:52.870 --> 04:15:52.880 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:15:55.710 --> 04:15:55.720 align:start position:0%
there but at the end of the day it's not
 
04:15:58.229 --> 04:15:58.239 align:start position:0%
zero cost the bill does require the
 
04:15:59.790 --> 04:15:59.800 align:start position:0%
university system and the community
 
04:16:02.349 --> 04:16:02.359 align:start position:0%
college system to administer monitor
 
04:16:02.359 --> 04:16:03.550 align:start position:0%
college system to administer monitor
ensure

04:16:03.550 --> 04:16:03.560 align:start position:0%
ensure
 
04:16:06.790 --> 04:16:06.800 align:start position:0%
compliance um and and again the language
 
04:16:09.590 --> 04:16:09.600 align:start position:0%
of the bill does not exempt New
 
04:16:11.830 --> 04:16:11.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire High School grads now
 
04:16:14.670 --> 04:16:14.680 align:start position:0%
presumably they would be exempt because
 
04:16:15.790 --> 04:16:15.800 align:start position:0%
after I
 
04:16:19.550 --> 04:16:19.560 align:start position:0%
think January 26 they everyone all high
 
04:16:22.910 --> 04:16:22.920 align:start position:0%
school graduates need to complete the
 
04:16:25.910 --> 04:16:25.920 align:start position:0%
exam about 48% of our students are not
 
04:16:28.149 --> 04:16:28.159 align:start position:0%
from New Hampshire so we would need to
 
04:16:32.309 --> 04:16:32.319 align:start position:0%
administer the test um even
 
04:16:36.630 --> 04:16:36.640 align:start position:0%
online keep records of it and certify
 
04:16:40.309 --> 04:16:40.319 align:start position:0%
presumably um passage and the the other
 
04:16:43.469 --> 04:16:43.479 align:start position:0%
part of this is um and I believe
 
04:16:45.269 --> 04:16:45.279 align:start position:0%
representative Weinstein asked this
 
04:16:46.950 --> 04:16:46.960 align:start position:0%
question so what happens with for
 
04:16:49.030 --> 04:16:49.040 align:start position:0%
students who don't pass the
 
04:16:51.429 --> 04:16:51.439 align:start position:0%
test I mean I guess you just keep taking
 
04:16:53.070 --> 04:16:53.080 align:start position:0%
the test over and over and over but we
 
04:16:54.750 --> 04:16:54.760 align:start position:0%
don't want
 
04:16:59.070 --> 04:16:59.080 align:start position:0%
to um you know cause a student not to
 
04:17:02.550 --> 04:17:02.560 align:start position:0%
graduate timely because the test wasn't
 
04:17:05.510 --> 04:17:05.520 align:start position:0%
especially if they just paid for their
 
04:17:10.149 --> 04:17:10.159 align:start position:0%
education um so again the
 
04:17:13.990 --> 04:17:14.000 align:start position:0%
the I agree 100% with the intent of the
 
04:17:18.750 --> 04:17:18.760 align:start position:0%
bill but it is not a zeroc cost
 
04:17:21.910 --> 04:17:21.920 align:start position:0%
effort um and one other point I I would
 
04:17:25.349 --> 04:17:25.359 align:start position:0%
like to make the the the enabling
 
04:17:29.030 --> 04:17:29.040 align:start position:0%
statute of the University system is RSA
 
04:17:34.269 --> 04:17:34.279 align:start position:0%
187a and um the legislature back in 1981
 
04:17:36.189 --> 04:17:36.199 align:start position:0%
that was the most recent iteration of
 
04:17:38.790 --> 04:17:38.800 align:start position:0%
the legislation gives broad authority to
 
04:17:39.950 --> 04:17:39.960 align:start position:0%
the Board of
 
04:17:44.590 --> 04:17:44.600 align:start position:0%
Trustees um on on a number of of issues
 
04:17:46.990 --> 04:17:47.000 align:start position:0%
including you know differing the
 
04:17:48.990 --> 04:17:49.000 align:start position:0%
graduation requirements that flows down
 
04:17:51.030 --> 04:17:51.040 align:start position:0%
through faculty and
 
04:17:55.269 --> 04:17:55.279 align:start position:0%
administration um we do think it's a it
 
04:17:57.229 --> 04:17:57.239 align:start position:0%
could be precedent setting that we're
 
04:18:00.630 --> 04:18:00.640 align:start position:0%
going to have graduation
 
04:18:03.030 --> 04:18:03.040 align:start position:0%
requirements mandated by the leg
 
04:18:05.149 --> 04:18:05.159 align:start position:0%
legislature this session alone there are
 
04:18:07.590 --> 04:18:07.600 align:start position:0%
three different bills that mandate
 
04:18:09.229 --> 04:18:09.239 align:start position:0%
various graduation
 
04:18:14.349 --> 04:18:14.359 align:start position:0%
requirements and um so just another
 
04:18:17.550 --> 04:18:17.560 align:start position:0%
thing to think about as you as you
 
04:18:20.510 --> 04:18:20.520 align:start position:0%
deliberate the the bill the cost and the
 
04:18:22.469 --> 04:18:22.479 align:start position:0%
graduation requirements in the testimony
 
04:18:25.030 --> 04:18:25.040 align:start position:0%
there are some other areas of question
 
04:18:28.750 --> 04:18:28.760 align:start position:0%
that that um we have with the bill but
 
04:18:31.149 --> 04:18:31.159 align:start position:0%
th those are the the
 
04:18:33.590 --> 04:18:33.600 align:start position:0%
primary concerns that the university
 
04:18:36.670 --> 04:18:36.680 align:start position:0%
system has with with
 
04:18:38.990 --> 04:18:39.000 align:start position:0%
hb12 happy to take any questions thank
 
04:18:40.429 --> 04:18:40.439 align:start position:0%
you very much are there any questions
 
04:18:42.269 --> 04:18:42.279 align:start position:0%
from the committee yeses representative
 
04:18:42.279 --> 04:18:43.349 align:start position:0%
from the committee yeses representative
McGuire

04:18:43.349 --> 04:18:43.359 align:start position:0%
McGuire
 
04:18:45.389 --> 04:18:45.399 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you madam
 
04:18:48.469 --> 04:18:48.479 align:start position:0%
Chancellor um so I think you I just
 
04:18:51.030 --> 04:18:51.040 align:start position:0%
heard you say that you and the and the
 
04:18:53.870 --> 04:18:53.880 align:start position:0%
Board of Trustees and the faculty have
 
04:18:56.710 --> 04:18:56.720 align:start position:0%
the authority to add this
 
04:18:58.910 --> 04:18:58.920 align:start position:0%
requirement if you thought it was
 
04:19:02.510 --> 04:19:02.520 align:start position:0%
valuable for graduation is that without
 
04:19:04.349 --> 04:19:04.359 align:start position:0%
getting into trouble with your
 
04:19:07.189 --> 04:19:07.199 align:start position:0%
accreditation or some other thing yes
 
04:19:09.870 --> 04:19:09.880 align:start position:0%
yes I believe so the the you know the
 
04:19:12.229 --> 04:19:12.239 align:start position:0%
faculty kind of own the curriculum if
 
04:19:14.109 --> 04:19:14.119 align:start position:0%
you will but yes I believe that's that's
 
04:19:17.269 --> 04:19:17.279 align:start position:0%
the case did I follow up yes thank you
 
04:19:19.710 --> 04:19:19.720 align:start position:0%
and would you say that that that group
 
04:19:24.590 --> 04:19:24.600 align:start position:0%
of people has an incentive to uh have
 
04:19:28.149 --> 04:19:28.159 align:start position:0%
more um non- New Hampshire students
 
04:19:31.870 --> 04:19:31.880 align:start position:0%
attend the University system and and
 
04:19:36.990 --> 04:19:37.000 align:start position:0%
graduate and and and and get a good
 
04:19:39.429 --> 04:19:39.439 align:start position:0%
education no I I don't I don't believe
 
04:19:41.670 --> 04:19:41.680 align:start position:0%
there's an incentive to have more outof
 
04:19:44.189 --> 04:19:44.199 align:start position:0%
State students
 
04:19:45.790 --> 04:19:45.800 align:start position:0%
is I'm sorry was that your question
 
04:19:48.990 --> 04:19:49.000 align:start position:0%
representative yeah I mean let me put it
 
04:19:51.670 --> 04:19:51.680 align:start position:0%
this way so if
 
04:19:54.309 --> 04:19:54.319 align:start position:0%
you assuming you thought that this was a
 
04:19:57.389 --> 04:19:57.399 align:start position:0%
good idea and would get get more
 
04:19:59.469 --> 04:19:59.479 align:start position:0%
students interested in coming to the
 
04:20:02.670 --> 04:20:02.680 align:start position:0%
university would would improve uh their
 
04:20:06.910 --> 04:20:06.920 align:start position:0%
education you have some incentive to do
 
04:20:06.920 --> 04:20:08.910 align:start position:0%
education you have some incentive to do
so

04:20:08.910 --> 04:20:08.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:20:12.349 --> 04:20:12.359 align:start position:0%
certainly if if right if we believed it
 
04:20:14.910 --> 04:20:14.920 align:start position:0%
would increase enrollment and education
 
04:20:19.429 --> 04:20:19.439 align:start position:0%
sure okay so all right thank you further
 
04:20:21.030 --> 04:20:21.040 align:start position:0%
questions from the
 
04:20:23.349 --> 04:20:23.359 align:start position:0%
committee yes representa
 
04:20:27.030 --> 04:20:27.040 align:start position:0%
Damon thank you Mr chair following up on
 
04:20:30.510 --> 04:20:30.520 align:start position:0%
my colleague down the lane
 
04:20:33.670 --> 04:20:33.680 align:start position:0%
here wouldn't it be correct that a
 
04:20:35.670 --> 04:20:35.680 align:start position:0%
potential student could simply take the
 
04:20:37.910 --> 04:20:37.920 align:start position:0%
test that the opportunity to take the
 
04:20:40.510 --> 04:20:40.520 align:start position:0%
test isn't an incentive to become a
 
04:20:45.469 --> 04:20:45.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:47.910 --> 04:20:47.920 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm sorry representative that one
 
04:20:47.920 --> 04:20:49.030 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm sorry representative that one
more

04:20:49.030 --> 04:20:49.040 align:start position:0%
more
 
04:20:53.030 --> 04:20:53.040 align:start position:0%
time I'm just trying to highlight and
 
04:20:56.830 --> 04:20:56.840 align:start position:0%
confirm that if this were imposed on the
 
04:20:59.030 --> 04:20:59.040 align:start position:0%
University by legislation to require
 
04:20:59.040 --> 04:21:01.030 align:start position:0%
University by legislation to require
this

04:21:01.030 --> 04:21:01.040 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:21:03.910 --> 04:21:03.920 align:start position:0%
test that perhaps you would not perceive
 
04:21:05.590 --> 04:21:05.600 align:start position:0%
this as an incentive for students to
 
04:21:07.309 --> 04:21:07.319 align:start position:0%
enroll in the University because they
 
04:21:09.750 --> 04:21:09.760 align:start position:0%
simply could take the test anyway
 
04:21:13.389 --> 04:21:13.399 align:start position:0%
without being a university student
 
04:21:17.429 --> 04:21:17.439 align:start position:0%
I I agree I'm not sure that um I I don't
 
04:21:21.109 --> 04:21:21.119 align:start position:0%
know that requiring this test would
 
04:21:24.590 --> 04:21:24.600 align:start position:0%
encourage more students to attend our
 
04:21:28.109 --> 04:21:28.119 align:start position:0%
institutions thank you further questions
 
04:21:29.870 --> 04:21:29.880 align:start position:0%
from the committee yes representative
 
04:21:32.670 --> 04:21:32.680 align:start position:0%
papovich thank you and uh thank you Mr
 
04:21:34.429 --> 04:21:34.439 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you again for taking
 
04:21:36.870 --> 04:21:36.880 align:start position:0%
questions in the line of the stuff that
 
04:21:38.550 --> 04:21:38.560 align:start position:0%
we've talked on an earlier Bill if the
 
04:21:40.830 --> 04:21:40.840 align:start position:0%
fiscal note is based on an incorrect
 
04:21:42.950 --> 04:21:42.960 align:start position:0%
assumption about the availability of the
 
04:21:46.070 --> 04:21:46.080 align:start position:0%
system could we please have it updated
 
04:21:48.070 --> 04:21:48.080 align:start position:0%
because this committee and the F and the
 
04:21:50.550 --> 04:21:50.560 align:start position:0%
finance committee will need you know
 
04:21:52.630 --> 04:21:52.640 align:start position:0%
something closer to reality and I know
 
04:21:55.429 --> 04:21:55.439 align:start position:0%
that we never can get it on the nose but
 
04:21:58.429 --> 04:21:58.439 align:start position:0%
could we please do that too yes we're
 
04:22:00.349 --> 04:22:00.359 align:start position:0%
working on that right now are there
 
04:22:02.349 --> 04:22:02.359 align:start position:0%
further questions from the
 
04:22:05.670 --> 04:22:05.680 align:start position:0%
committee thank you very much thank you
 
04:22:09.109 --> 04:22:09.119 align:start position:0%
next uh person up is Shannon Reed from
 
04:22:11.510 --> 04:22:11.520 align:start position:0%
the community college system
 
04:22:15.510 --> 04:22:15.520 align:start position:0%
and I support the bill
 
04:22:18.750 --> 04:22:18.760 align:start position:0%
probably with amendments could you speak
 
04:22:21.790 --> 04:22:21.800 align:start position:0%
to your amendments please sure I can I
 
04:22:24.070 --> 04:22:24.080 align:start position:0%
can speak to all of that the pink cards
 
04:22:27.109 --> 04:22:27.119 align:start position:0%
don't allow um a great range of um
 
04:22:28.990 --> 04:22:29.000 align:start position:0%
possibilities it's I support I oppose
 
04:22:30.349 --> 04:22:30.359 align:start position:0%
and we're at a point with the community
 
04:22:32.790 --> 04:22:32.800 align:start position:0%
college system where we we would like to
 
04:22:34.790 --> 04:22:34.800 align:start position:0%
get to a point where we can support it
 
04:22:37.070 --> 04:22:37.080 align:start position:0%
um with a few amendments that the
 
04:22:40.429 --> 04:22:40.439 align:start position:0%
sponsor and I have discussed and um I'm
 
04:22:41.950 --> 04:22:41.960 align:start position:0%
making sure that you all understand a
 
04:22:43.670 --> 04:22:43.680 align:start position:0%
few things about implementation and I'm
 
04:22:46.030 --> 04:22:46.040 align:start position:0%
sorry let me start correctly uh I'm
 
04:22:47.710 --> 04:22:47.720 align:start position:0%
Shannon Reed director of government
 
04:22:49.030 --> 04:22:49.040 align:start position:0%
affairs with the community college
 
04:22:51.389 --> 04:22:51.399 align:start position:0%
system of New Hampshire um thank you for
 
04:22:54.070 --> 04:22:54.080 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to testify on H
 
04:22:58.070 --> 04:22:58.080 align:start position:0%
112 So as I said uh a moment ago we are
 
04:23:00.510 --> 04:23:00.520 align:start position:0%
interested in making this work we would
 
04:23:03.109 --> 04:23:03.119 align:start position:0%
first like to figure out the mechanics
 
04:23:05.510 --> 04:23:05.520 align:start position:0%
of it internally implementing this is
 
04:23:08.189 --> 04:23:08.199 align:start position:0%
not as simple as it sounds and we don't
 
04:23:10.070 --> 04:23:10.080 align:start position:0%
have that mapped out yet we'd like to
 
04:23:12.550 --> 04:23:12.560 align:start position:0%
get a better idea of how to set it up
 
04:23:14.750 --> 04:23:14.760 align:start position:0%
how to keep it going and what resources
 
04:23:17.630 --> 04:23:17.640 align:start position:0%
that will take so um just quickly a
 
04:23:20.309 --> 04:23:20.319 align:start position:0%
couple things about the the test itself
 
04:23:22.590 --> 04:23:22.600 align:start position:0%
um the way the test is used for
 
04:23:24.710 --> 04:23:24.720 align:start position:0%
citizenship purposes versus the way the
 
04:23:27.189 --> 04:23:27.199 align:start position:0%
test would be used in this instance
 
04:23:29.269 --> 04:23:29.279 align:start position:0%
there are two main differences when
 
04:23:30.990 --> 04:23:31.000 align:start position:0%
someone takes a test for
 
04:23:34.309 --> 04:23:34.319 align:start position:0%
citizenship they go to a room they're
 
04:23:35.670 --> 04:23:35.680 align:start position:0%
they're face to face with the person
 
04:23:37.630 --> 04:23:37.640 align:start position:0%
who's asking them the questions as as
 
04:23:40.149 --> 04:23:40.159 align:start position:0%
you've done there the questioner chooses
 
04:23:41.910 --> 04:23:41.920 align:start position:0%
any 10 questions from the test and the
 
04:23:43.950 --> 04:23:43.960 align:start position:0%
person takeing it has to just get six
 
04:23:47.030 --> 04:23:47.040 align:start position:0%
right some of the questions are somewhat
 
04:23:48.550 --> 04:23:48.560 align:start position:0%
open-ended there are more there's more
 
04:23:50.429 --> 04:23:50.439 align:start position:0%
than one way to get it right um they're
 
04:23:52.349 --> 04:23:52.359 align:start position:0%
not all true false or multiple question
 
04:23:55.429 --> 04:23:55.439 align:start position:0%
and this is why the test itself in its
 
04:23:57.910 --> 04:23:57.920 align:start position:0%
in its official version does not lend
 
04:24:01.189 --> 04:24:01.199 align:start position:0%
itself to being taken online it can't be
 
04:24:03.349 --> 04:24:03.359 align:start position:0%
um it can't be taken electronically and
 
04:24:05.750 --> 04:24:05.760 align:start position:0%
scored automatically because of those
 
04:24:08.630 --> 04:24:08.640 align:start position:0%
somewhat subjective um Elements which is
 
04:24:10.630 --> 04:24:10.640 align:start position:0%
why the Department of Education when
 
04:24:13.030 --> 04:24:13.040 align:start position:0%
they were implementing House Bill 320
 
04:24:14.510 --> 04:24:14.520 align:start position:0%
they went to a vendor they had a version
 
04:24:17.590 --> 04:24:17.600 align:start position:0%
of the test created that was close
 
04:24:19.550 --> 04:24:19.560 align:start position:0%
enough deemed to be close enough but was
 
04:24:21.469 --> 04:24:21.479 align:start position:0%
all multiple choice Andor true false
 
04:24:23.510 --> 04:24:23.520 align:start position:0%
questions so there's a version that New
 
04:24:26.870 --> 04:24:26.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire owns I'm told we can use it um
 
04:24:29.189 --> 04:24:29.199 align:start position:0%
that the department has purchased that
 
04:24:31.990 --> 04:24:32.000 align:start position:0%
would work to be delivered online it's
 
04:24:33.670 --> 04:24:33.680 align:start position:0%
something that we could in theory we
 
04:24:35.269 --> 04:24:35.279 align:start position:0%
could load it into our learning
 
04:24:37.830 --> 04:24:37.840 align:start position:0%
management system canvas and deliver it
 
04:24:39.269 --> 04:24:39.279 align:start position:0%
to students that way they could take it
 
04:24:41.389 --> 04:24:41.399 align:start position:0%
and it could be automatically scored and
 
04:24:43.670 --> 04:24:43.680 align:start position:0%
we assume after our conversations with
 
04:24:45.630 --> 04:24:45.640 align:start position:0%
the Department that this test could be
 
04:24:47.870 --> 04:24:47.880 align:start position:0%
made available to us at no cost even
 
04:24:49.630 --> 04:24:49.640 align:start position:0%
though it did cost the department um
 
04:24:52.229 --> 04:24:52.239 align:start position:0%
some some resources to have it have it
 
04:24:54.830 --> 04:24:54.840 align:start position:0%
uh set up so as far as the
 
04:24:56.950 --> 04:24:56.960 align:start position:0%
mechanics um I have been talking about
 
04:25:00.469 --> 04:25:00.479 align:start position:0%
this bill a lot over the last a week um
 
04:25:02.870 --> 04:25:02.880 align:start position:0%
with our director of it whose team would
 
04:25:04.109 --> 04:25:04.119 align:start position:0%
be the ones that would need to set this
 
04:25:06.550 --> 04:25:06.560 align:start position:0%
up and make the process work and in at
 
04:25:08.070 --> 04:25:08.080 align:start position:0%
least initially it would be a bit of a
 
04:25:10.670 --> 04:25:10.680 align:start position:0%
lift um it would have to be set up
 
04:25:12.389 --> 04:25:12.399 align:start position:0%
managed monitored some of what we would
 
04:25:15.550 --> 04:25:15.560 align:start position:0%
have to do would be um in addition to to
 
04:25:17.429 --> 04:25:17.439 align:start position:0%
loading the test basically putting it
 
04:25:19.670 --> 04:25:19.680 align:start position:0%
into our LMS we'd have to crosswalk
 
04:25:21.830 --> 04:25:21.840 align:start position:0%
confirmation of completion to our
 
04:25:23.670 --> 04:25:23.680 align:start position:0%
registar and get that put into our
 
04:25:25.590 --> 04:25:25.600 align:start position:0%
student management system we'd want to
 
04:25:27.510 --> 04:25:27.520 align:start position:0%
set that up manually so that it's not
 
04:25:28.670 --> 04:25:28.680 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry we'd want to set it up
 
04:25:30.469 --> 04:25:30.479 align:start position:0%
automatically so it's not a manual
 
04:25:32.950 --> 04:25:32.960 align:start position:0%
process we would need a mechanism to
 
04:25:36.349 --> 04:25:36.359 align:start position:0%
show um completion from the high school
 
04:25:37.590 --> 04:25:37.600 align:start position:0%
students who come to us because
 
04:25:39.149 --> 04:25:39.159 align:start position:0%
presumably they all would have taken it
 
04:25:41.109 --> 04:25:41.119 align:start position:0%
after a certain date we' need to
 
04:25:43.070 --> 04:25:43.080 align:start position:0%
automate communication to students to
 
04:25:44.510 --> 04:25:44.520 align:start position:0%
make sure they get reminders if they
 
04:25:46.109 --> 04:25:46.119 align:start position:0%
haven't taken the test and they're
 
04:25:47.990 --> 04:25:48.000 align:start position:0%
approaching their graduation date and
 
04:25:49.630 --> 04:25:49.640 align:start position:0%
for us that includes multiple points
 
04:25:51.550 --> 04:25:51.560 align:start position:0%
across the Academic Year we graduate
 
04:25:54.030 --> 04:25:54.040 align:start position:0%
people in December May and August at
 
04:25:56.389 --> 04:25:56.399 align:start position:0%
least um and then we we basically need
 
04:25:58.109 --> 04:25:58.119 align:start position:0%
someone to oversee and manage this at
 
04:25:59.910 --> 04:25:59.920 align:start position:0%
the beginning and then be responsible
 
04:26:02.349 --> 04:26:02.359 align:start position:0%
for ongoing compliance so as as my as a
 
04:26:04.189 --> 04:26:04.199 align:start position:0%
previous speaker said all these things
 
04:26:07.189 --> 04:26:07.199 align:start position:0%
are doable but but yes there is there is
 
04:26:11.070 --> 04:26:11.080 align:start position:0%
there are cost elements to it um and we
 
04:26:13.349 --> 04:26:13.359 align:start position:0%
have a small it team are already fairly
 
04:26:15.030 --> 04:26:15.040 align:start position:0%
overextended on things like network
 
04:26:16.950 --> 04:26:16.960 align:start position:0%
security and cyber security and and
 
04:26:20.269 --> 04:26:20.279 align:start position:0%
managing our networks so we'd have to
 
04:26:22.149 --> 04:26:22.159 align:start position:0%
figure out do we task this to somebody
 
04:26:24.189 --> 04:26:24.199 align:start position:0%
new how do we get this how do we get
 
04:26:26.790 --> 04:26:26.800 align:start position:0%
this um the the how do we get this
 
04:26:29.189 --> 04:26:29.199 align:start position:0%
staffed basically and we just haven't
 
04:26:32.349 --> 04:26:32.359 align:start position:0%
started to lay that out yet so since the
 
04:26:34.389 --> 04:26:34.399 align:start position:0%
legislature passed House Bill 320 and
 
04:26:35.710 --> 04:26:35.720 align:start position:0%
made this requirement in the high
 
04:26:38.750 --> 04:26:38.760 align:start position:0%
schools starting this year um those
 
04:26:40.149 --> 04:26:40.159 align:start position:0%
students will have already met it and
 
04:26:41.630 --> 04:26:41.640 align:start position:0%
that's that's the good news the
 
04:26:43.309 --> 04:26:43.319 align:start position:0%
challenge is that there's no mechanism
 
04:26:44.830 --> 04:26:44.840 align:start position:0%
in the department of education's
 
04:26:47.469 --> 04:26:47.479 align:start position:0%
platform to transmit verified completion
 
04:26:49.469 --> 04:26:49.479 align:start position:0%
to us so that would just have to be
 
04:26:52.229 --> 04:26:52.239 align:start position:0%
built um and whether their vendor would
 
04:26:55.149 --> 04:26:55.159 align:start position:0%
work with us um through the doe contract
 
04:26:57.830 --> 04:26:57.840 align:start position:0%
or charge us to to put that in place we
 
04:27:00.109 --> 04:27:00.119 align:start position:0%
we don't know and I say these things not
 
04:27:01.950 --> 04:27:01.960 align:start position:0%
to discourage you or to close doors on
 
04:27:04.550 --> 04:27:04.560 align:start position:0%
this idea but just to be realistic there
 
04:27:06.429 --> 04:27:06.439 align:start position:0%
is a cost to adding a set of tasks and
 
04:27:08.710 --> 04:27:08.720 align:start position:0%
keeping that going over time um we do
 
04:27:10.109 --> 04:27:10.119 align:start position:0%
have some concerns about placing
 
04:27:11.429 --> 04:27:11.439 align:start position:0%
additional barriers in front of our
 
04:27:13.710 --> 04:27:13.720 align:start position:0%
students um who will otherwise have
 
04:27:16.750 --> 04:27:16.760 align:start position:0%
earned their their degrees um and we'd
 
04:27:18.990 --> 04:27:19.000 align:start position:0%
have to address any issues related to
 
04:27:20.950 --> 04:27:20.960 align:start position:0%
withholding degrees or certificates from
 
04:27:22.670 --> 04:27:22.680 align:start position:0%
completers who haven't finished the test
 
04:27:25.229 --> 04:27:25.239 align:start position:0%
yet something we have to to work out
 
04:27:27.070 --> 04:27:27.080 align:start position:0%
we're do we're willing to do this work
 
04:27:28.830 --> 04:27:28.840 align:start position:0%
to achieve the outcomes that the sponsor
 
04:27:30.630 --> 04:27:30.640 align:start position:0%
described um but we do need to
 
04:27:32.389 --> 04:27:32.399 align:start position:0%
anticipate it will require some time
 
04:27:34.469 --> 04:27:34.479 align:start position:0%
oversight and and some cost and we we'd
 
04:27:36.349 --> 04:27:36.359 align:start position:0%
like to know more about that before the
 
04:27:38.109 --> 04:27:38.119 align:start position:0%
legislature commits us to move forward
 
04:27:40.469 --> 04:27:40.479 align:start position:0%
with this um if something is worth doing
 
04:27:41.870 --> 04:27:41.880 align:start position:0%
it's it's worth doing right and worth
 
04:27:43.710 --> 04:27:43.720 align:start position:0%
doing well and worth understanding what
 
04:27:47.149 --> 04:27:47.159 align:start position:0%
that will all entail so the two
 
04:27:49.189 --> 04:27:49.199 align:start position:0%
amendments that I had discussed with the
 
04:27:51.710 --> 04:27:51.720 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor um would would do two
 
04:27:53.830 --> 04:27:53.840 align:start position:0%
things one is limit this to students
 
04:27:57.309 --> 04:27:57.319 align:start position:0%
earning an associate degree which
 
04:28:00.630 --> 04:28:00.640 align:start position:0%
um which just better kind of defines the
 
04:28:02.590 --> 04:28:02.600 align:start position:0%
population as I believe the chair
 
04:28:04.149 --> 04:28:04.159 align:start position:0%
pointed out we have students who come in
 
04:28:05.910 --> 04:28:05.920 align:start position:0%
for all kinds of purposes it might just
 
04:28:07.750 --> 04:28:07.760 align:start position:0%
be a course or two it might be a
 
04:28:10.750 --> 04:28:10.760 align:start position:0%
short-term technical certificate and and
 
04:28:12.990 --> 04:28:13.000 align:start position:0%
it's I think it would be simpler if we
 
04:28:15.309 --> 04:28:15.319 align:start position:0%
if we restricted this to our associate
 
04:28:18.189 --> 04:28:18.199 align:start position:0%
degree seeking students and then second
 
04:28:20.750 --> 04:28:20.760 align:start position:0%
allow us to block exempt anyone who's
 
04:28:22.149 --> 04:28:22.159 align:start position:0%
graduated from a New Hampshire High
 
04:28:26.469 --> 04:28:26.479 align:start position:0%
School from say January 1 2026 forward
 
04:28:29.830 --> 04:28:29.840 align:start position:0%
now we'd still need to code them in some
 
04:28:31.269 --> 04:28:31.279 align:start position:0%
way we still need to figure that out but
 
04:28:33.149 --> 04:28:33.159 align:start position:0%
if we could do that as a block rather
 
04:28:36.109 --> 04:28:36.119 align:start position:0%
than on an individual student basis um
 
04:28:37.189 --> 04:28:37.199 align:start position:0%
on the assumption that they will have
 
04:28:39.750 --> 04:28:39.760 align:start position:0%
complied with this pursuant to House
 
04:28:43.510 --> 04:28:43.520 align:start position:0%
Bill 320 so um I'll just wrap up by
 
04:28:45.070 --> 04:28:45.080 align:start position:0%
saying that you know ideally we'd like a
 
04:28:46.710 --> 04:28:46.720 align:start position:0%
little more time to figure this out
 
04:28:48.870 --> 04:28:48.880 align:start position:0%
before this committee or the legislature
 
04:28:51.109 --> 04:28:51.119 align:start position:0%
commits us to going forward we are we
 
04:28:53.229 --> 04:28:53.239 align:start position:0%
absolutely willing to do that um but I
 
04:28:54.950 --> 04:28:54.960 align:start position:0%
hopefully I've outlined some of the you
 
04:28:57.990 --> 04:28:58.000 align:start position:0%
know some of the kind of specifics that
 
04:28:59.510 --> 04:28:59.520 align:start position:0%
that cause us to understand that this
 
04:29:01.630 --> 04:29:01.640 align:start position:0%
will be this will be some work and I'd
 
04:29:04.189 --> 04:29:04.199 align:start position:0%
be happy to try to take questions thank
 
04:29:06.670 --> 04:29:06.680 align:start position:0%
you very much questions yes
 
04:29:09.429 --> 04:29:09.439 align:start position:0%
representative luno then representative
 
04:29:12.269 --> 04:29:12.279 align:start position:0%
spilsbury thank you very much Mr chair
 
04:29:15.149 --> 04:29:15.159 align:start position:0%
thank you very much um um M Reed for uh
 
04:29:17.469 --> 04:29:17.479 align:start position:0%
for joining us this afternoon um I want
 
04:29:19.910 --> 04:29:19.920 align:start position:0%
to get back to a question that that I'd
 
04:29:22.070 --> 04:29:22.080 align:start position:0%
asked the prime sponsor earlier and so
 
04:29:24.229 --> 04:29:24.239 align:start position:0%
I'd like to ask it to you as well with
 
04:29:26.670 --> 04:29:26.680 align:start position:0%
in a little bit of an expanded scope but
 
04:29:29.309 --> 04:29:29.319 align:start position:0%
are you aware of any um any data out
 
04:29:32.790 --> 04:29:32.800 align:start position:0%
there uh with respect to the efficacy of
 
04:29:35.710 --> 04:29:35.720 align:start position:0%
this type of exam that's you know it it
 
04:29:38.030 --> 04:29:38.040 align:start position:0%
doesn't come packaged with curriculum or
 
04:29:40.389 --> 04:29:40.399 align:start position:0%
instruction or anything like that it's
 
04:29:44.710 --> 04:29:44.720 align:start position:0%
just an exam any efficacy in terms of um
 
04:29:46.870 --> 04:29:46.880 align:start position:0%
in terms of I guess student
 
04:29:48.950 --> 04:29:48.960 align:start position:0%
understanding and involvement and and
 
04:29:52.229 --> 04:29:52.239 align:start position:0%
Civic engagement n that's number one and
 
04:29:54.790 --> 04:29:54.800 align:start position:0%
um and what are other community colleges
 
04:29:57.469 --> 04:29:57.479 align:start position:0%
around the country doing with respect to
 
04:30:00.349 --> 04:30:00.359 align:start position:0%
uh this and have they seen any data so
 
04:30:02.550 --> 04:30:02.560 align:start position:0%
with respect to efficacy if there is
 
04:30:04.469 --> 04:30:04.479 align:start position:0%
data which there may well be I'm not
 
04:30:09.670 --> 04:30:09.680 align:start position:0%
aware of it um and your second question
 
04:30:12.870 --> 04:30:12.880 align:start position:0%
I I don't think that the is a widespread
 
04:30:14.950 --> 04:30:14.960 align:start position:0%
requirement among community colleges in
 
04:30:19.030 --> 04:30:19.040 align:start position:0%
the across the country representative
 
04:30:22.229 --> 04:30:22.239 align:start position:0%
spilsbury thank you Mr chairman uh so as
 
04:30:24.510 --> 04:30:24.520 align:start position:0%
the sponsor indicated 93% of the
 
04:30:26.269 --> 04:30:26.279 align:start position:0%
students in the uh community college
 
04:30:27.830 --> 04:30:27.840 align:start position:0%
system did graduate from New Hampshire
 
04:30:30.109 --> 04:30:30.119 align:start position:0%
High Schools I assume your request for
 
04:30:32.229 --> 04:30:32.239 align:start position:0%
an amendment that would allow a block
 
04:30:35.510 --> 04:30:35.520 align:start position:0%
exemption is to reduce the
 
04:30:37.830 --> 04:30:37.840 align:start position:0%
administrative burden of having a case
 
04:30:40.030 --> 04:30:40.040 align:start position:0%
by case show proof is that correct or is
 
04:30:41.630 --> 04:30:41.640 align:start position:0%
there more to it um that's mostly
 
04:30:44.189 --> 04:30:44.199 align:start position:0%
correct um thank you for the question
 
04:30:46.830 --> 04:30:46.840 align:start position:0%
the yeah the request to have us able to
 
04:30:48.189 --> 04:30:48.199 align:start position:0%
exempt this group as a block is to
 
04:30:49.750 --> 04:30:49.760 align:start position:0%
reduce the administrative work but I
 
04:30:51.510 --> 04:30:51.520 align:start position:0%
just want to clarify something on the
 
04:30:54.590 --> 04:30:54.600 align:start position:0%
93% 93% of community college students
 
04:30:57.710 --> 04:30:57.720 align:start position:0%
are New Hampshire residents
 
04:31:02.830 --> 04:31:02.840 align:start position:0%
but about 40% of our students are what's
 
04:31:04.750 --> 04:31:04.760 align:start position:0%
considered non-traditional age Learners
 
04:31:07.269 --> 04:31:07.279 align:start position:0%
so I think that's 24 and above so they
 
04:31:08.750 --> 04:31:08.760 align:start position:0%
would not have met this requirement in
 
04:31:10.429 --> 04:31:10.439 align:start position:0%
high school that's not a it's not a huge
 
04:31:11.910 --> 04:31:11.920 align:start position:0%
number it's not a small number but it's
 
04:31:14.149 --> 04:31:14.159 align:start position:0%
it's a group that that we would have to
 
04:31:18.429 --> 04:31:18.439 align:start position:0%
kind of you know deal with as individual
 
04:31:20.830 --> 04:31:20.840 align:start position:0%
students got it so that's why your block
 
04:31:23.510 --> 04:31:23.520 align:start position:0%
exemption related to those students who
 
04:31:27.030 --> 04:31:27.040 align:start position:0%
graduated after a certain date right on
 
04:31:28.349 --> 04:31:28.359 align:start position:0%
the assumption that they will have
 
04:31:31.189 --> 04:31:31.199 align:start position:0%
complied with this requirement oh sounds
 
04:31:32.469 --> 04:31:32.479 align:start position:0%
like this the Amendments you're
 
04:31:34.510 --> 04:31:34.520 align:start position:0%
suggesting would be
 
04:31:38.630 --> 04:31:38.640 align:start position:0%
helpful thank you further
 
04:31:43.630 --> 04:31:43.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:46.990 --> 04:31:47.000 align:start position:0%
my question is uh is related to May
 
04:31:49.710 --> 04:31:49.720 align:start position:0%
overlap with the efficacy testing
 
04:31:52.710 --> 04:31:52.720 align:start position:0%
question um but
 
04:31:55.229 --> 04:31:55.239 align:start position:0%
um it's it's a simple
 
04:31:58.469 --> 04:31:58.479 align:start position:0%
question to ask but probably much harder
 
04:32:01.510 --> 04:32:01.520 align:start position:0%
to answer and it it's really performance
 
04:32:06.109 --> 04:32:06.119 align:start position:0%
on the test um what is the what's your
 
04:32:09.630 --> 04:32:09.640 align:start position:0%
understanding of the failure and uh need
 
04:32:12.349 --> 04:32:12.359 align:start position:0%
to repeatedly take a test
 
04:32:15.630 --> 04:32:15.640 align:start position:0%
of those who have been taking this test
 
04:32:18.149 --> 04:32:18.159 align:start position:0%
in different different environments and
 
04:32:20.109 --> 04:32:20.119 align:start position:0%
different places different ways of
 
04:32:22.229 --> 04:32:22.239 align:start position:0%
administering the test I understand all
 
04:32:24.469 --> 04:32:24.479 align:start position:0%
of what you said about that it's
 
04:32:26.269 --> 04:32:26.279 align:start position:0%
different again for you in the community
 
04:32:28.070 --> 04:32:28.080 align:start position:0%
college system figuring out how to do
 
04:32:33.149 --> 04:32:33.159 align:start position:0%
this but any information on uh on who
 
04:32:35.990 --> 04:32:36.000 align:start position:0%
passes and who doesn't pass I mean since
 
04:32:38.630 --> 04:32:38.640 align:start position:0%
we haven't had this requirement
 
04:32:41.030 --> 04:32:41.040 align:start position:0%
implemented I don't have any performance
 
04:32:45.309 --> 04:32:45.319 align:start position:0%
data to offer I I can say I I believe
 
04:32:48.070 --> 04:32:48.080 align:start position:0%
the answers to the test are fairly easy
 
04:32:48.080 --> 04:32:48.950 align:start position:0%
the answers to the test are fairly easy
to

04:32:48.950 --> 04:32:48.960 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:32:52.830 --> 04:32:52.840 align:start position:0%
find um and this isn't a proctored exam
 
04:32:54.990 --> 04:32:55.000 align:start position:0%
this wouldn't be something where you
 
04:32:56.670 --> 04:32:56.680 align:start position:0%
have to study and then come in hoping
 
04:32:58.030 --> 04:32:58.040 align:start position:0%
hoping you remember enough and know
 
04:33:00.429 --> 04:33:00.439 align:start position:0%
enough you could literally look at the
 
04:33:01.790 --> 04:33:01.800 align:start position:0%
answers as you're looking at the
 
04:33:04.150 --> 04:33:04.160 align:start position:0%
questions which you know may have some
 
04:33:06.551 --> 04:33:06.561 align:start position:0%
value though it it it kind of forces you
 
04:33:09.269 --> 04:33:09.279 align:start position:0%
to engage with the questions um so I you
 
04:33:11.789 --> 04:33:11.799 align:start position:0%
know just because you can do that
 
04:33:14.349 --> 04:33:14.359 align:start position:0%
doesn't in my my opinion anyway and I
 
04:33:16.310 --> 04:33:16.320 align:start position:0%
I'm not a teacher um but I don't think
 
04:33:19.629 --> 04:33:19.639 align:start position:0%
that invalidates the value of of seeing
 
04:33:20.910 --> 04:33:20.920 align:start position:0%
what the questions are and finding the
 
04:33:23.230 --> 04:33:23.240 align:start position:0%
answers and matching those two things up
 
04:33:25.910 --> 04:33:25.920 align:start position:0%
but I don't have any information about
 
04:33:25.920 --> 04:33:27.070 align:start position:0%
but I don't have any information about
um

04:33:27.070 --> 04:33:27.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:33:30.230 --> 04:33:30.240 align:start position:0%
performance advocacy history Etc oh
 
04:33:32.070 --> 04:33:32.080 align:start position:0%
thank you that's that is helpful what
 
04:33:34.390 --> 04:33:34.400 align:start position:0%
you just said thank
 
04:33:37.390 --> 04:33:37.400 align:start position:0%
you uh Shan and I have a question um you
 
04:33:39.470 --> 04:33:39.480 align:start position:0%
mentioned the word proctored a few
 
04:33:39.480 --> 04:33:40.390 align:start position:0%
mentioned the word proctored a few
moments

04:33:40.390 --> 04:33:40.400 align:start position:0%
moments
 
04:33:43.869 --> 04:33:43.879 align:start position:0%
ago if the test is proctored and you're
 
04:33:45.789 --> 04:33:45.799 align:start position:0%
looking at the whites of their eyes you
 
04:33:48.590 --> 04:33:48.600 align:start position:0%
know who's taking it I could take a a
 
04:33:50.510 --> 04:33:50.520 align:start position:0%
test or do a report on this thing now
 
04:33:53.349 --> 04:33:53.359 align:start position:0%
and AI could answer everything for me
 
04:33:56.029 --> 04:33:56.039 align:start position:0%
and um you don't even know if I'm Johnny
 
04:34:00.709 --> 04:34:00.719 align:start position:0%
Jones uh taking the test so how how how
 
04:34:04.109 --> 04:34:04.119 align:start position:0%
would you manage online assessment well
 
04:34:05.910 --> 04:34:05.920 align:start position:0%
to a certain extent we could and to a
 
04:34:07.709 --> 04:34:07.719 align:start position:0%
certain extent we couldn't students do
 
04:34:10.629 --> 04:34:10.639 align:start position:0%
need to sign into their canvas accounts
 
04:34:12.789 --> 04:34:12.799 align:start position:0%
so the student has to do that could they
 
04:34:14.990 --> 04:34:15.000 align:start position:0%
then say hey come take this for me to
 
04:34:17.910 --> 04:34:17.920 align:start position:0%
someone in the room I guess they could
 
04:34:19.269 --> 04:34:19.279 align:start position:0%
hadn't thought about that as a as a
 
04:34:19.279 --> 04:34:20.709 align:start position:0%
hadn't thought about that as a as a
complication

04:34:20.709 --> 04:34:20.719 align:start position:0%
complication
 
04:34:22.830 --> 04:34:22.840 align:start position:0%
um you know I think we would try to do
 
04:34:24.470 --> 04:34:24.480 align:start position:0%
some messaging around this about the
 
04:34:26.230 --> 04:34:26.240 align:start position:0%
value of knowing these things on your
 
04:34:29.629 --> 04:34:29.639 align:start position:0%
own knowing these things um but sure
 
04:34:32.670 --> 04:34:32.680 align:start position:0%
could someone pull someone in to do it
 
04:34:35.709 --> 04:34:35.719 align:start position:0%
for them I I I guess we couldn't prevent
 
04:34:38.551 --> 04:34:38.561 align:start position:0%
that thank you further
 
04:34:44.629 --> 04:34:44.639 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:47.910 --> 04:34:47.920 align:start position:0%
so I use canvas for my online courses
 
04:34:50.590 --> 04:34:50.600 align:start position:0%
and it seems these cost estimates are a
 
04:34:53.551 --> 04:34:53.561 align:start position:0%
little high because all you need to do
 
04:34:56.310 --> 04:34:56.320 align:start position:0%
is set up a canvas shell populate the
 
04:34:58.551 --> 04:34:58.561 align:start position:0%
the quiz with questions and then upload
 
04:35:02.029 --> 04:35:02.039 align:start position:0%
the student names and um you can also
 
04:35:04.310 --> 04:35:04.320 align:start position:0%
have videotaping of the session where
 
04:35:06.709 --> 04:35:06.719 align:start position:0%
they hold up an ID card and you verify
 
04:35:09.629 --> 04:35:09.639 align:start position:0%
the actual student and that you get a
 
04:35:11.789 --> 04:35:11.799 align:start position:0%
report after the video is recorded
 
04:35:14.709 --> 04:35:14.719 align:start position:0%
indicating if there's any detection of
 
04:35:17.990 --> 04:35:18.000 align:start position:0%
um illegal or you
 
04:35:21.390 --> 04:35:21.400 align:start position:0%
know un um acceptable behavior going on
 
04:35:24.709 --> 04:35:24.719 align:start position:0%
during the quiz so I don't understand
 
04:35:27.750 --> 04:35:27.760 align:start position:0%
how um the fiscal note can say that
 
04:35:29.990 --> 04:35:30.000 align:start position:0%
there are significant complexity to
 
04:35:32.590 --> 04:35:32.600 align:start position:0%
doing this and it's going to be very
 
04:35:34.429 --> 04:35:34.439 align:start position:0%
expensive it would take me about an hour
 
04:35:37.310 --> 04:35:37.320 align:start position:0%
to set up the quiz um both the community
 
04:35:39.349 --> 04:35:39.359 align:start position:0%
colleges and the the universities all
 
04:35:42.551 --> 04:35:42.561 align:start position:0%
use canvas don't they the the community
 
04:35:43.949 --> 04:35:43.959 align:start position:0%
colleges Ed canvas I'm not sure about
 
04:35:47.709 --> 04:35:47.719 align:start position:0%
the university system um so you I would
 
04:35:51.230 --> 04:35:51.240 align:start position:0%
say yes or no to to that question um
 
04:35:52.789 --> 04:35:52.799 align:start position:0%
things you talk about potentially
 
04:35:55.910 --> 04:35:55.920 align:start position:0%
videotaping the sessions and auditing
 
04:35:58.109 --> 04:35:58.119 align:start position:0%
the reports sure we could do those
 
04:35:59.310 --> 04:35:59.320 align:start position:0%
things but someone has to do those
 
04:36:00.429 --> 04:36:00.439 align:start position:0%
things which means someone has to be
 
04:36:01.869 --> 04:36:01.879 align:start position:0%
paid to do those things which which
 
04:36:03.429 --> 04:36:03.439 align:start position:0%
means there there there would be a cost
 
04:36:06.029 --> 04:36:06.039 align:start position:0%
I think the more you the more you add in
 
04:36:09.910 --> 04:36:09.920 align:start position:0%
terms of um validation and um the more
 
04:36:12.551 --> 04:36:12.561 align:start position:0%
you add finish that to steps the more
 
04:36:14.990 --> 04:36:15.000 align:start position:0%
you add to the cost the fiscal
 
04:36:17.629 --> 04:36:17.639 align:start position:0%
note uh when I constructed the fiscal
 
04:36:19.789 --> 04:36:19.799 align:start position:0%
note for this bill I was looking at what
 
04:36:21.551 --> 04:36:21.561 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education had to go
 
04:36:23.629 --> 04:36:23.639 align:start position:0%
through to comply which was significant
 
04:36:26.109 --> 04:36:26.119 align:start position:0%
both in cost and workload and I was
 
04:36:30.949 --> 04:36:30.959 align:start position:0%
looking also at um the possibility of
 
04:36:34.150 --> 04:36:34.160 align:start position:0%
having to set up coding an API to have
 
04:36:37.510 --> 04:36:37.520 align:start position:0%
the Department's vendor send us High
 
04:36:39.910 --> 04:36:39.920 align:start position:0%
School completion data and the
 
04:36:42.310 --> 04:36:42.320 align:start position:0%
vendor informally estimated that at
 
04:36:45.150 --> 04:36:45.160 align:start position:0%
$100,000 now I think we could probably
 
04:36:47.150 --> 04:36:47.160 align:start position:0%
set up something simpler if we're able
 
04:36:49.670 --> 04:36:49.680 align:start position:0%
to block exempt as we've talked about
 
04:36:51.390 --> 04:36:51.400 align:start position:0%
but that was part that was one of the
 
04:36:52.910 --> 04:36:52.920 align:start position:0%
assumptions built into the fiscal impact
 
04:36:55.750 --> 04:36:55.760 align:start position:0%
statement another was simply you know if
 
04:36:59.629 --> 04:36:59.639 align:start position:0%
we can't find existing staff to manage
 
04:37:01.109 --> 04:37:01.119 align:start position:0%
this and and might have to bring someone
 
04:37:03.949 --> 04:37:03.959 align:start position:0%
on that would be a
 
04:37:06.429 --> 04:37:06.439 align:start position:0%
cost are there further
 
04:37:06.439 --> 04:37:09.510 align:start position:0%
cost are there further
questions

04:37:09.510 --> 04:37:09.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:14.750 --> 04:37:14.760 align:start position:0%
yes hi I just had question if um someone
 
04:37:19.230 --> 04:37:19.240 align:start position:0%
is uh new to this country and did pass
 
04:37:22.670 --> 04:37:22.680 align:start position:0%
um the citizenship test and our citizens
 
04:37:24.990 --> 04:37:25.000 align:start position:0%
but they're not that proficient in
 
04:37:28.349 --> 04:37:28.359 align:start position:0%
English um but they enter the uh
 
04:37:31.269 --> 04:37:31.279 align:start position:0%
Community College for whatever it is
 
04:37:34.269 --> 04:37:34.279 align:start position:0%
they're going for is there something to
 
04:37:37.590 --> 04:37:37.600 align:start position:0%
help them or what would they go through
 
04:37:41.109 --> 04:37:41.119 align:start position:0%
um and when would they have to take this
 
04:37:42.629 --> 04:37:42.639 align:start position:0%
ver of the
 
04:37:42.639 --> 04:37:44.230 align:start position:0%
ver of the
test

04:37:44.230 --> 04:37:44.240 align:start position:0%
test
 
04:37:48.830 --> 04:37:48.840 align:start position:0%
um I just thought you know or would they
 
04:37:51.830 --> 04:37:51.840 align:start position:0%
be um you know would they have to do it
 
04:37:54.109 --> 04:37:54.119 align:start position:0%
again take the test the 90 questions or
 
04:37:57.629 --> 04:37:57.639 align:start position:0%
whatever 120 question test and if they
 
04:38:02.590 --> 04:38:02.600 align:start position:0%
did um at what time would that
 
04:38:04.551 --> 04:38:04.561 align:start position:0%
happen uh thank you for the for the
 
04:38:06.310 --> 04:38:06.320 align:start position:0%
question at what time that would happen
 
04:38:08.150 --> 04:38:08.160 align:start position:0%
would have to be any time prior to the
 
04:38:10.629 --> 04:38:10.639 align:start position:0%
student earning their associate degree
 
04:38:12.949 --> 04:38:12.959 align:start position:0%
so presum presumably in a in a degree
 
04:38:14.551 --> 04:38:14.561 align:start position:0%
program that might take two years
 
04:38:16.109 --> 04:38:16.119 align:start position:0%
sometime within that 2-year period the
 
04:38:18.230 --> 04:38:18.240 align:start position:0%
student would have to take it if the
 
04:38:19.910 --> 04:38:19.920 align:start position:0%
student had an issue with English
 
04:38:21.750 --> 04:38:21.760 align:start position:0%
language proficiency I haven't thought
 
04:38:24.230 --> 04:38:24.240 align:start position:0%
about that um I'm sure there are ways to
 
04:38:26.590 --> 04:38:26.600 align:start position:0%
deal with it I I just don't know what
 
04:38:27.949 --> 04:38:27.959 align:start position:0%
those are whether it's some kind of an
 
04:38:33.429 --> 04:38:33.439 align:start position:0%
AI translator uh type of um resource or
 
04:38:35.629 --> 04:38:35.639 align:start position:0%
a person helping them to understand the
 
04:38:37.910 --> 04:38:37.920 align:start position:0%
questions I don't know thank you good
 
04:38:37.920 --> 04:38:42.109 align:start position:0%
questions I don't know thank you good
question

04:38:42.109 --> 04:38:42.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:42.119 --> 04:38:43.830 align:start position:0%
 
representative

04:38:43.830 --> 04:38:43.840 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:38:43.840 --> 04:38:45.510 align:start position:0%
representative
baky

04:38:45.510 --> 04:38:45.520 align:start position:0%
baky
 
04:38:49.551 --> 04:38:49.561 align:start position:0%
okay yeah sorry thank you you're welcome
 
04:38:54.150 --> 04:38:54.160 align:start position:0%
thank you um so I guess follow up
 
04:38:57.789 --> 04:38:57.799 align:start position:0%
to what representative just asked you so
 
04:39:01.510 --> 04:39:01.520 align:start position:0%
if they took the 10 question quiz or
 
04:39:07.349 --> 04:39:07.359 align:start position:0%
test or um and became a citizen and then
 
04:39:11.070 --> 04:39:11.080 align:start position:0%
went to college how how like how does
 
04:39:13.150 --> 04:39:13.160 align:start position:0%
that or have you thought of that I guess
 
04:39:15.990 --> 04:39:16.000 align:start position:0%
is really what I would so when I asked
 
04:39:17.949 --> 04:39:17.959 align:start position:0%
when I said or would they have to take
 
04:39:21.029 --> 04:39:21.039 align:start position:0%
it that was what I was thinking of I
 
04:39:23.629 --> 04:39:23.639 align:start position:0%
think that in the in the bill itself
 
04:39:27.990 --> 04:39:28.000 align:start position:0%
line line 21 and 22 it says exchange
 
04:39:30.230 --> 04:39:30.240 align:start position:0%
students and foreign Nationals shall be
 
04:39:31.709 --> 04:39:31.719 align:start position:0%
exempt from this
 
04:39:34.670 --> 04:39:34.680 align:start position:0%
section sorry that's
 
04:39:36.750 --> 04:39:36.760 align:start position:0%
okay thank
 
04:39:40.070 --> 04:39:40.080 align:start position:0%
you question represent papovich thank
 
04:39:42.550 --> 04:39:42.560 align:start position:0%
you again um one we talk amendments I'd
 
04:39:44.910 --> 04:39:44.920 align:start position:0%
like to point out that if you want to
 
04:39:47.270 --> 04:39:47.280 align:start position:0%
exclude people who already took the test
 
04:39:49.788 --> 04:39:49.798 align:start position:0%
uh naturalized citizens would probably
 
04:39:54.190 --> 04:39:54.200 align:start position:0%
also uh make that bill since uh you know
 
04:39:56.990 --> 04:39:57.000 align:start position:0%
they already had to pass it just a
 
04:39:58.590 --> 04:39:58.600 align:start position:0%
suggestion I don't know whether it's a
 
04:40:00.230 --> 04:40:00.240 align:start position:0%
good idea I would appreciate you know I
 
04:40:03.628 --> 04:40:03.638 align:start position:0%
hope it's worth your your
 
04:40:05.590 --> 04:40:05.600 align:start position:0%
consideration I I think it's a it's a
 
04:40:08.230 --> 04:40:08.240 align:start position:0%
good point and you know these are some
 
04:40:10.230 --> 04:40:10.240 align:start position:0%
of the questions and possibilities that
 
04:40:11.510 --> 04:40:11.520 align:start position:0%
we'd want to be we'd want to work
 
04:40:13.948 --> 04:40:13.958 align:start position:0%
through so we had a better picture of
 
04:40:16.550 --> 04:40:16.560 align:start position:0%
what we were going to be doing thank you
 
04:40:18.948 --> 04:40:18.958 align:start position:0%
very much no more questions we're going
 
04:40:22.110 --> 04:40:22.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:25.030 --> 04:40:25.040 align:start position:0%
hearing 193 is going to be real quickly
 
04:40:27.868 --> 04:40:27.878 align:start position:0%
I'll go introduce it and you can get get
 
04:40:31.590 --> 04:40:31.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:36.390 --> 04:40:36.400 align:start position:0%
you okay we're going to move on to HB
 
04:40:39.628 --> 04:40:39.638 align:start position:0%
193 and uh the prime sponsor
 
04:40:42.110 --> 04:40:42.120 align:start position:0%
representative lad is is going to

Bill thank you very much chairman

spillsbury and members of the education
 
04:40:56.750 --> 04:40:56.760 align:start position:0%
funding committee uh for the record my
 
04:40:59.350 --> 04:40:59.360 align:start position:0%
name is Rick glad I come from hail New
 
04:41:01.550 --> 04:41:01.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Crafton 5 and I'm here to
 
04:41:05.788 --> 04:41:05.798 align:start position:0%
introduce House Bill 193 this bill is a
 
04:41:07.868 --> 04:41:07.878 align:start position:0%
bill that's being put forth on behalf of
 
04:41:11.310 --> 04:41:11.320 align:start position:0%
the community college system uh in fact
 
04:41:13.708 --> 04:41:13.718 align:start position:0%
they have basically written it uh it's
 
04:41:15.190 --> 04:41:15.200 align:start position:0%
relative to the maximum number of
 
04:41:17.150 --> 04:41:17.160 align:start position:0%
credits per course eligible for the Dual
 
04:41:19.590 --> 04:41:19.600 align:start position:0%
and concurrent enrollment program this
 
04:41:23.110 --> 04:41:23.120 align:start position:0%
is a bipartisan Bill the issue which we
 
04:41:26.150 --> 04:41:26.160 align:start position:0%
had back when we first initiated dual
 
04:41:30.550 --> 04:41:30.560 align:start position:0%
concurrent enrollment we allowed uh five
 
04:41:32.948 --> 04:41:32.958 align:start position:0%
credit courses for a maximum of 15
 
04:41:34.470 --> 04:41:34.480 align:start position:0%
credit hours that was back when we only
 
04:41:36.948 --> 04:41:36.958 align:start position:0%
had grades 11 and 12 participating since
 
04:41:39.030 --> 04:41:39.040 align:start position:0%
that that's all been changed it's now
 
04:41:41.990 --> 04:41:42.000 align:start position:0%
open to grades 10 11 and 12 students in
 
04:41:44.390 --> 04:41:44.400 align:start position:0%
those grades and up to four courses per
 
04:41:48.190 --> 04:41:48.200 align:start position:0%
year the issue is that in various
 
04:41:51.868 --> 04:41:51.878 align:start position:0%
certain trades and courses at the
 
04:41:54.868 --> 04:41:54.878 align:start position:0%
community college system a course can
 
04:41:58.230 --> 04:41:58.240 align:start position:0%
include up to 12
 
04:42:02.110 --> 04:42:02.120 align:start position:0%
credits now we're talking more money per
 
04:42:05.070 --> 04:42:05.080 align:start position:0%
course and the way it works is we fund
 
04:42:08.270 --> 04:42:08.280 align:start position:0%
these courses through our allocation in
 
04:42:09.990 --> 04:42:10.000 align:start position:0%
the state budget in the budget we
 
04:42:13.910 --> 04:42:13.920 align:start position:0%
approve at $150 per
 
04:42:17.510 --> 04:42:17.520 align:start position:0%
course around $2.5
 
04:42:20.110 --> 04:42:20.120 align:start position:0%
million a
 
04:42:23.190 --> 04:42:23.200 align:start position:0%
year and what we need to do is slice
 
04:42:25.708 --> 04:42:25.718 align:start position:0%
this thing back so uh students going to
 
04:42:28.590 --> 04:42:28.600 align:start position:0%
be right now it's only up to we say up
 
04:42:30.390 --> 04:42:30.400 align:start position:0%
to four but they only have enough money
 
04:42:34.670 --> 04:42:34.680 align:start position:0%
for up to two courses per year per kid
 
04:42:38.110 --> 04:42:38.120 align:start position:0%
so now it's going to be up to these
 
04:42:40.788 --> 04:42:40.798 align:start position:0%
courses that are no more than four
 
04:42:44.868 --> 04:42:44.878 align:start position:0%
credit a piece so that is the change
 
04:42:46.550 --> 04:42:46.560 align:start position:0%
that this build do you can see by
 
04:42:48.590 --> 04:42:48.600 align:start position:0%
reading on the bill there's only one
 
04:42:51.350 --> 04:42:51.360 align:start position:0%
line change each course funded pursuant
 
04:42:54.110 --> 04:42:54.120 align:start position:0%
to this paragraph shall not exceed four
 
04:42:56.948 --> 04:42:56.958 align:start position:0%
credits we've had courses which are up
 
04:43:01.230 --> 04:43:01.240 align:start position:0%
to 12 credits and that is pushing the
 
04:43:03.470 --> 04:43:03.480 align:start position:0%
appropriation dollar that we need Way
 
04:43:06.030 --> 04:43:06.040 align:start position:0%
Beyond what we're going to provide to
 
04:43:08.350 --> 04:43:08.360 align:start position:0%
the community college system and these
 
04:43:10.670 --> 04:43:10.680 align:start position:0%
courses are really needed Down Below in
 
04:43:12.190 --> 04:43:12.200 align:start position:0%
fact the community college system is
 
04:43:15.948 --> 04:43:15.958 align:start position:0%
even offered to send kids or not kids
 
04:43:17.910 --> 04:43:17.920 align:start position:0%
teachers instructors from the community
 
04:43:20.910 --> 04:43:20.920 align:start position:0%
college system like nhti down to places
 
04:43:23.510 --> 04:43:23.520 align:start position:0%
like Franklin which don't have people
 
04:43:25.948 --> 04:43:25.958 align:start position:0%
qualified to teach these courses so the
 
04:43:27.390 --> 04:43:27.400 align:start position:0%
courses would be taught concurrent
 
04:43:30.110 --> 04:43:30.120 align:start position:0%
enrollment wise in the school so the
 
04:43:32.110 --> 04:43:32.120 align:start position:0%
community college is really working with
 
04:43:34.628 --> 04:43:34.638 align:start position:0%
uh education K through 12 and I
 
04:43:37.070 --> 04:43:37.080 align:start position:0%
encourage us uh move this bill forward
 
04:43:38.788 --> 04:43:38.798 align:start position:0%
thank you very
 
04:43:42.750 --> 04:43:42.760 align:start position:0%
much thank you very much uh Mr chairman
 
04:43:45.550 --> 04:43:45.560 align:start position:0%
any questions yes representative P pleas
 
04:43:48.430 --> 04:43:48.440 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh thank you for
 
04:43:51.590 --> 04:43:51.600 align:start position:0%
uh taking questions your testimony says
 
04:43:56.510 --> 04:43:56.520 align:start position:0%
that it's a $100 $150 tuition C cost per
 
04:43:59.070 --> 04:43:59.080 align:start position:0%
course is that per course per credit is
 
04:44:02.030 --> 04:44:02.040 align:start position:0%
there a relationship by course by course
 
04:44:05.750 --> 04:44:05.760 align:start position:0%
and it's paid you know it's money is in
 
04:44:08.350 --> 04:44:08.360 align:start position:0%
our budget which goes to the community
 
04:44:10.110 --> 04:44:10.120 align:start position:0%
college system and takes care of that
 
04:44:12.190 --> 04:44:12.200 align:start position:0%
tuition cost for students in high school
 
04:44:15.110 --> 04:44:15.120 align:start position:0%
that are eligible thank you so the cost
 
04:44:17.150 --> 04:44:17.160 align:start position:0%
would be the same whether they take a
 
04:44:19.150 --> 04:44:19.160 align:start position:0%
one credit course a four credit course a
 
04:44:21.310 --> 04:44:21.320 align:start position:0%
12 credit cours that's a good question
 
04:44:23.230 --> 04:44:23.240 align:start position:0%
for the committee C for Shannon thank
 
04:44:28.150 --> 04:44:28.160 align:start position:0%
you I will hold yep thank you other
 
04:44:31.670 --> 04:44:31.680 align:start position:0%
questions yes represent thank you thank
 
04:44:33.910 --> 04:44:33.920 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman and thank you for taking
 
04:44:33.920 --> 04:44:34.670 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman and thank you for taking
my

04:44:34.670 --> 04:44:34.680 align:start position:0%
my
 
04:44:38.230 --> 04:44:38.240 align:start position:0%
question um if this is to go forward
 
04:44:41.030 --> 04:44:41.040 align:start position:0%
who's paying for how is this the or who
 
04:44:42.390 --> 04:44:42.400 align:start position:0%
who's paying for the teachers at the
 
04:44:45.030 --> 04:44:45.040 align:start position:0%
high school level to be um teaching
 
04:44:47.270 --> 04:44:47.280 align:start position:0%
these courses if the revenue is going to
 
04:44:49.550 --> 04:44:49.560 align:start position:0%
the Community College how are the
 
04:44:51.350 --> 04:44:51.360 align:start position:0%
expenses for the teacher being covered I
 
04:44:53.390 --> 04:44:53.400 align:start position:0%
see where you're going with that the
 
04:44:54.670 --> 04:44:54.680 align:start position:0%
high school
 
04:44:57.750 --> 04:44:57.760 align:start position:0%
is paying the teacher that they have
 
04:45:00.030 --> 04:45:00.040 align:start position:0%
hired that's by negotiated agreement all
 
04:45:02.670 --> 04:45:02.680 align:start position:0%
that on staff to teach that course if
 
04:45:05.948 --> 04:45:05.958 align:start position:0%
that teacher meets the accreditation
 
04:45:07.830 --> 04:45:07.840 align:start position:0%
standards for teaching that college
 
04:45:10.190 --> 04:45:10.200 align:start position:0%
credit course so they're going to have
 
04:45:12.350 --> 04:45:12.360 align:start position:0%
to make sure they a master's
 
04:45:15.510 --> 04:45:15.520 align:start position:0%
degree and and using materials
 
04:45:17.470 --> 04:45:17.480 align:start position:0%
associated with that course which are
 
04:45:19.708 --> 04:45:19.718 align:start position:0%
taught used at the community college
 
04:45:22.628 --> 04:45:22.638 align:start position:0%
system now your question is driving at
 
04:45:26.628 --> 04:45:26.638 align:start position:0%
the fact well okay is the college then
 
04:45:29.110 --> 04:45:29.120 align:start position:0%
going to
 
04:45:32.590 --> 04:45:32.600 align:start position:0%
um the person is is that person is there
 
04:45:35.430 --> 04:45:35.440 align:start position:0%
going to be $150 for that course and I
 
04:45:37.390 --> 04:45:37.400 align:start position:0%
would say yes there will be seeing that
 
04:45:40.270 --> 04:45:40.280 align:start position:0%
it's still a credit a course credit
 
04:45:42.110 --> 04:45:42.120 align:start position:0%
that's offered through the community
 
04:45:45.550 --> 04:45:45.560 align:start position:0%
college system so that's where that 150
 
04:45:47.430 --> 04:45:47.440 align:start position:0%
bucks is going to be used it may be
 
04:45:49.868 --> 04:45:49.878 align:start position:0%
taught through your high school teacher
 
04:45:52.868 --> 04:45:52.878 align:start position:0%
but the the course is being one which is
 
04:45:54.430 --> 04:45:54.440 align:start position:0%
approved through the accrediting
 
04:46:01.628 --> 04:46:01.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:04.948 --> 04:46:04.958 align:start position:0%
college would you be amenable to having
 
04:46:07.470 --> 04:46:07.480 align:start position:0%
the Community College reimburse the
 
04:46:10.270 --> 04:46:10.280 align:start position:0%
taxpayers of that high school to cover
 
04:46:14.430 --> 04:46:14.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:17.708 --> 04:46:17.718 align:start position:0%
course we have a program that's been
 
04:46:20.510 --> 04:46:20.520 align:start position:0%
working and when we look this over the
 
04:46:23.830 --> 04:46:23.840 align:start position:0%
entire budget which we approve and when
 
04:46:25.470 --> 04:46:25.480 align:start position:0%
we're looking what concurrent dual
 
04:46:29.470 --> 04:46:29.480 align:start position:0%
enrollment does by providing this dollar
 
04:46:31.948 --> 04:46:31.958 align:start position:0%
to the community college system we could
 
04:46:34.708 --> 04:46:34.718 align:start position:0%
be saving that student who later takes
 
04:46:36.190 --> 04:46:36.200 align:start position:0%
that when they're in the community
 
04:46:38.390 --> 04:46:38.400 align:start position:0%
college system or Mom and Dad are paying
 
04:46:42.628 --> 04:46:42.638 align:start position:0%
for it between 10 and 15
 
04:46:45.390 --> 04:46:45.400 align:start position:0%
Million by that bit that we
 
04:46:48.470 --> 04:46:48.480 align:start position:0%
appropriate this is not the cost for
 
04:46:51.150 --> 04:46:51.160 align:start position:0%
that course that the person that's not
 
04:46:53.230 --> 04:46:53.240 align:start position:0%
in high school is going to have to pay
 
04:46:55.350 --> 04:46:55.360 align:start position:0%
this course is really discounted I can
 
04:46:56.510 --> 04:46:56.520 align:start position:0%
remember when we
 
04:47:00.350 --> 04:47:00.360 align:start position:0%
negotiated this fee of $150 with Ros
 
04:47:02.670 --> 04:47:02.680 align:start position:0%
catel that's years ago when he was
 
04:47:05.270 --> 04:47:05.280 align:start position:0%
Chancellor Economist of the community
 
04:47:08.070 --> 04:47:08.080 align:start position:0%
college system so I don't think I would
 
04:47:10.110 --> 04:47:10.120 align:start position:0%
be amenable to that I think that we have
 
04:47:12.830 --> 04:47:12.840 align:start position:0%
a program that's working at a minimum
 
04:47:16.948 --> 04:47:16.958 align:start position:0%
cost and it's a huge huge savings to
 
04:47:19.110 --> 04:47:19.120 align:start position:0%
families so that's where the property
 
04:47:21.230 --> 04:47:21.240 align:start position:0%
taxpayers is going to be saved between
 
04:47:23.548 --> 04:47:23.558 align:start position:0%
that 10 and 15 Mill million do which
 
04:47:25.670 --> 04:47:25.680 align:start position:0%
they are saving for not having to pay
 
04:47:27.628 --> 04:47:27.638 align:start position:0%
for that when that student is no longer
 
04:47:32.750 --> 04:47:32.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:35.670 --> 04:47:35.680 align:start position:0%
student further questions thank you very
 
04:47:37.750 --> 04:47:37.760 align:start position:0%
quick I I'm just trying to better
 
04:47:39.628 --> 04:47:39.638 align:start position:0%
understand this topic would it be fair
 
04:47:41.708 --> 04:47:41.718 align:start position:0%
to say that
 
04:47:43.750 --> 04:47:43.760 align:start position:0%
this is a dual enrollment class and
 
04:47:45.628 --> 04:47:45.638 align:start position:0%
therefore it's already part of the
 
04:47:47.788 --> 04:47:47.798 align:start position:0%
obligation of the high school to teach
 
04:47:50.350 --> 04:47:50.360 align:start position:0%
that class anyway all the program does
 
04:47:52.868 --> 04:47:52.878 align:start position:0%
is that it makes it also applicable to
 
04:47:56.190 --> 04:47:56.200 align:start position:0%
college a dual Roan Pro prr course is
 
04:47:59.430 --> 04:47:59.440 align:start position:0%
one that's taught at the college by the
 
04:48:02.708 --> 04:48:02.718 align:start position:0%
qualified college professor or teacher
 
04:48:05.548 --> 04:48:05.558 align:start position:0%
the concurrent is one which has at the
 
04:48:07.670 --> 04:48:07.680 align:start position:0%
high school corre correct thank you I I
 
04:48:09.990 --> 04:48:10.000 align:start position:0%
meant thank you for the clarification so
 
04:48:13.230 --> 04:48:13.240 align:start position:0%
the concurrent one that's the one where
 
04:48:14.910 --> 04:48:14.920 align:start position:0%
basically they would the the local
 
04:48:16.110 --> 04:48:16.120 align:start position:0%
school district already had an
 
04:48:18.350 --> 04:48:18.360 align:start position:0%
obligation to meet you know to teach the
 
04:48:20.110 --> 04:48:20.120 align:start position:0%
kids enough credits to get to their
 
04:48:22.310 --> 04:48:22.320 align:start position:0%
graduation requirements this does not
 
04:48:24.310 --> 04:48:24.320 align:start position:0%
impose an additional burden on the
 
04:48:26.150 --> 04:48:26.160 align:start position:0%
school district beyond what they were
 
04:48:28.990 --> 04:48:29.000 align:start position:0%
going to be required to do anyway right
 
04:48:31.830 --> 04:48:31.840 align:start position:0%
right we the these concurrent credit
 
04:48:34.110 --> 04:48:34.120 align:start position:0%
courses are done through oftentimes a
 
04:48:36.548 --> 04:48:36.558 align:start position:0%
teacher that's doing an AP
 
04:48:41.230 --> 04:48:41.240 align:start position:0%
course we we're competing
 
04:48:43.948 --> 04:48:43.958 align:start position:0%
Keane Plymouth excuse me the community
 
04:48:48.390 --> 04:48:48.400 align:start position:0%
college system oftentimes competes with
 
04:48:52.030 --> 04:48:52.040 align:start position:0%
Sno who does not require the person to
 
04:48:55.470 --> 04:48:55.480 align:start position:0%
have a master's they require only a
 
04:48:58.510 --> 04:48:58.520 align:start position:0%
bachelor's degree we're getting I
 
04:49:01.548 --> 04:49:01.558 align:start position:0%
believe and I've seen what snow is doing
 
04:49:03.990 --> 04:49:04.000 align:start position:0%
at at the high school my own students
 
04:49:07.510 --> 04:49:07.520 align:start position:0%
grandchildren go to I believe the what
 
04:49:10.310 --> 04:49:10.320 align:start position:0%
we get out of our public school system
 
04:49:12.990 --> 04:49:13.000 align:start position:0%
is better quality I I don't want to go
 
04:49:14.270 --> 04:49:14.280 align:start position:0%
any further than that because we're
 
04:49:15.788 --> 04:49:15.798 align:start position:0%
talking about one of
 
04:49:18.190 --> 04:49:18.200 align:start position:0%
our education institutions in the state
 
04:49:20.030 --> 04:49:20.040 align:start position:0%
of New
 
04:49:23.750 --> 04:49:23.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so Mr chair uh would you agree
 
04:49:26.788 --> 04:49:26.798 align:start position:0%
basically this is just modifying and
 
04:49:29.430 --> 04:49:29.440 align:start position:0%
limiting an already existing program and
 
04:49:31.590 --> 04:49:31.600 align:start position:0%
if it has any fiscal impact it's to
 
04:49:32.788 --> 04:49:32.798 align:start position:0%
reduce it
 
04:49:32.798 --> 04:49:37.510 align:start position:0%
reduce it
somewhat

04:49:37.510 --> 04:49:37.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:42.230 --> 04:49:42.240 align:start position:0%
yes um okay thank you thank you Mr
 
04:49:44.310 --> 04:49:44.320 align:start position:0%
chairman uh I would just like to follow
 
04:49:45.910 --> 04:49:45.920 align:start position:0%
up on the question that my colleague
 
04:49:48.430 --> 04:49:48.440 align:start position:0%
says uh asked so that I have some
 
04:49:50.750 --> 04:49:50.760 align:start position:0%
clarification with the
 
04:49:54.788 --> 04:49:54.798 align:start position:0%
concurrent education or or teaching is
 
04:49:57.390 --> 04:49:57.400 align:start position:0%
there is the college system receiving
 
04:49:59.910 --> 04:49:59.920 align:start position:0%
revenue for that student who is in the
 
04:50:02.948 --> 04:50:02.958 align:start position:0%
concurrent enrollment or is the public
 
04:50:05.390 --> 04:50:05.400 align:start position:0%
school the the the K through 12 school
 
04:50:07.628 --> 04:50:07.638 align:start position:0%
receiving the revenue for teaching that
 
04:50:09.590 --> 04:50:09.600 align:start position:0%
class the Community College systems
 
04:50:11.270 --> 04:50:11.280 align:start position:0%
receiving that Revenue
 
04:50:14.190 --> 04:50:14.200 align:start position:0%
the student is the benefactor of that
 
04:50:16.788 --> 04:50:16.798 align:start position:0%
Revenue thank
 
04:50:19.110 --> 04:50:19.120 align:start position:0%
you other
 
04:50:20.868 --> 04:50:20.878 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much
 
04:50:20.878 --> 04:50:22.750 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much

so Shannon Reed for the community
 
04:50:43.558 --> 04:50:44.430 align:start position:0%
so Shannon Reed for the community
college

04:50:44.430 --> 04:50:44.440 align:start position:0%
college
 
04:50:46.470 --> 04:50:46.480 align:start position:0%
system thank you Shannon Reed for the
 
04:50:49.628 --> 04:50:49.638 align:start position:0%
community college system um and I can be
 
04:50:51.230 --> 04:50:51.240 align:start position:0%
fairly quick and simple I think the the
 
04:50:52.990 --> 04:50:53.000 align:start position:0%
chairman explained um what this bill
 
04:50:55.390 --> 04:50:55.400 align:start position:0%
does most community college system
 
04:50:56.990 --> 04:50:57.000 align:start position:0%
courses are three credits or four
 
04:51:00.430 --> 04:51:00.440 align:start position:0%
credits um however we do offer some
 
04:51:02.230 --> 04:51:02.240 align:start position:0%
courses in formats that make them more
 
04:51:04.948 --> 04:51:04.958 align:start position:0%
than four credits and we we're what
 
04:51:07.830 --> 04:51:07.840 align:start position:0%
we're trying to do is simply um Define
 
04:51:09.470 --> 04:51:09.480 align:start position:0%
the scope of what's covered under this
 
04:51:10.990 --> 04:51:11.000 align:start position:0%
program to those that are through three
 
04:51:13.150 --> 04:51:13.160 align:start position:0%
or four credits we would appreciate it
 
04:51:14.788 --> 04:51:14.798 align:start position:0%
if you consider changing the effective
 
04:51:17.030 --> 04:51:17.040 align:start position:0%
date of this bill to upon passage so
 
04:51:18.350 --> 04:51:18.360 align:start position:0%
that this can become effective for our
 
04:51:23.548 --> 04:51:23.558 align:start position:0%
summer semester um and if if I may um
 
04:51:24.910 --> 04:51:24.920 align:start position:0%
just address a couple of the questions
 
04:51:27.670 --> 04:51:27.680 align:start position:0%
that came up um these are the courses
 
04:51:29.030 --> 04:51:29.040 align:start position:0%
that are taught in high school for dual
 
04:51:31.990 --> 04:51:32.000 align:start position:0%
credit are 100% still courses that
 
04:51:33.390 --> 04:51:33.400 align:start position:0%
confer High School Credit they're part
 
04:51:35.948 --> 04:51:35.958 align:start position:0%
of a high school students normal course
 
04:51:37.708 --> 04:51:37.718 align:start position:0%
load they're taught by their teachers
 
04:51:40.150 --> 04:51:40.160 align:start position:0%
but they're designed as college courses
 
04:51:42.510 --> 04:51:42.520 align:start position:0%
so that the students get credit so this
 
04:51:43.628 --> 04:51:43.638 align:start position:0%
isn't something that the high school
 
04:51:45.110 --> 04:51:45.120 align:start position:0%
students are doing that's an addition
 
04:51:46.190 --> 04:51:46.200 align:start position:0%
the high school teachers are doing
 
04:51:47.990 --> 04:51:48.000 align:start position:0%
that's that's an addition necessarily
 
04:51:49.430 --> 04:51:49.440 align:start position:0%
it's what they do it's what they do
 
04:51:51.190 --> 04:51:51.200 align:start position:0%
anyway it's just the course is of a
 
04:51:53.910 --> 04:51:53.920 align:start position:0%
different nature um this the courses are
 
04:51:55.270 --> 04:51:55.280 align:start position:0%
being offered already at a very
 
04:51:58.270 --> 04:51:58.280 align:start position:0%
significant discount to the students um
 
04:51:59.510 --> 04:51:59.520 align:start position:0%
so to the extent that the community
 
04:52:01.510 --> 04:52:01.520 align:start position:0%
college system is receiving revenue from
 
04:52:01.520 --> 04:52:02.590 align:start position:0%
college system is receiving revenue from
this

04:52:02.590 --> 04:52:02.600 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:52:05.990 --> 04:52:06.000 align:start position:0%
program um it's it's a significant
 
04:52:07.590 --> 04:52:07.600 align:start position:0%
discount off of what we would charge if
 
04:52:09.430 --> 04:52:09.440 align:start position:0%
that student couldn't take English comp
 
04:52:10.788 --> 04:52:10.798 align:start position:0%
the senior year of high school and had
 
04:52:12.310 --> 04:52:12.320 align:start position:0%
to come to the college and take it so
 
04:52:14.470 --> 04:52:14.480 align:start position:0%
we're sort of in a way cannibalizing our
 
04:52:17.230 --> 04:52:17.240 align:start position:0%
own our own future Revenue in order to
 
04:52:18.948 --> 04:52:18.958 align:start position:0%
support students while they're in high
 
04:52:20.868 --> 04:52:20.878 align:start position:0%
school so that they can get dual credit
 
04:52:25.788 --> 04:52:25.798 align:start position:0%
and I I perhaps assume um more uh
 
04:52:27.030 --> 04:52:27.040 align:start position:0%
familiarity with this program than I
 
04:52:28.430 --> 04:52:28.440 align:start position:0%
should but I'm happy to explain it in
 
04:52:30.150 --> 04:52:30.160 align:start position:0%
Greater depth when you're not you know
 
04:52:31.868 --> 04:52:31.878 align:start position:0%
an hour behind on your um committee
 
04:52:34.948 --> 04:52:34.958 align:start position:0%
schedule today um but as far as what the
 
04:52:36.350 --> 04:52:36.360 align:start position:0%
community college distri does is we
 
04:52:37.788 --> 04:52:37.798 align:start position:0%
manage this program we employ
 
04:52:39.868 --> 04:52:39.878 align:start position:0%
coordinators for our seven colleges to
 
04:52:41.628 --> 04:52:41.638 align:start position:0%
work with high school teachers and
 
04:52:43.510 --> 04:52:43.520 align:start position:0%
parents and students we promote and
 
04:52:46.430 --> 04:52:46.440 align:start position:0%
Market the program we invest in a system
 
04:52:48.830 --> 04:52:48.840 align:start position:0%
called dual enroll where um again it's
 
04:52:50.670 --> 04:52:50.680 align:start position:0%
kind of seamless automated way of
 
04:52:52.990 --> 04:52:53.000 align:start position:0%
crediting the this uh students course
 
04:52:54.670 --> 04:52:54.680 align:start position:0%
course completion in our system they
 
04:52:56.150 --> 04:52:56.160 align:start position:0%
received current strips from us so this
 
04:52:59.270 --> 04:52:59.280 align:start position:0%
is not simply courses that that happen
 
04:53:01.350 --> 04:53:01.360 align:start position:0%
kind of happen to confer credit there's
 
04:53:02.750 --> 04:53:02.760 align:start position:0%
significant infrastructure that does go
 
04:53:04.948 --> 04:53:04.958 align:start position:0%
into that so as the chairman said this
 
04:53:07.230 --> 04:53:07.240 align:start position:0%
has been a very successful program since
 
04:53:09.708 --> 04:53:09.718 align:start position:0%
about 1999 it's grown steadily every
 
04:53:11.990 --> 04:53:12.000 align:start position:0%
year 10,000 high school students take
 
04:53:14.110 --> 04:53:14.120 align:start position:0%
advantage of it as of the current year
 
04:53:17.190 --> 04:53:17.200 align:start position:0%
and um we would it's certainly been a
 
04:53:18.708 --> 04:53:18.718 align:start position:0%
success story and I think a win-win for
 
04:53:20.830 --> 04:53:20.840 align:start position:0%
the state thank
 
04:53:25.788 --> 04:53:25.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:29.150 --> 04:53:29.160 align:start position:0%
questions see none okay and I don't
 
04:53:30.708 --> 04:53:30.718 align:start position:0%
believe we have anybody else signed up
 
04:53:33.670 --> 04:53:33.680 align:start position:0%
for this bill so with that I'll close
 
04:53:37.190 --> 04:53:37.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:46.590 --> 04:53:46.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:51.310 --> 04:53:51.320 align:start position:0%
550 and uh representative luno is here
 
04:53:56.510 --> 04:53:56.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:59.110 --> 04:53:59.120 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you very much uh Mr chair
 
04:54:01.548 --> 04:54:01.558 align:start position:0%
members of the committee and it's not my
 
04:54:04.750 --> 04:54:04.760 align:start position:0%
bill it's a bill I don't take U um
 
04:54:07.470 --> 04:54:07.480 align:start position:0%
anything that uh that I file proprietary
 
04:54:11.310 --> 04:54:11.320 align:start position:0%
in nature so um so for the my name is
 
04:54:11.320 --> 04:54:12.310 align:start position:0%
in nature so um so for the my name is
David

04:54:12.310 --> 04:54:12.320 align:start position:0%
David
 
04:54:14.670 --> 04:54:14.680 align:start position:0%
luno and I represent the people of
 
04:54:17.110 --> 04:54:17.120 align:start position:0%
Hopkinson and Bo and uh conquered
 
04:54:19.150 --> 04:54:19.160 align:start position:0%
Houston be in my district too so throw
 
04:54:22.150 --> 04:54:22.160 align:start position:0%
conquered in and um and people in fact
 
04:54:25.110 --> 04:54:25.120 align:start position:0%
all over the wonderful Granite State
 
04:54:28.150 --> 04:54:28.160 align:start position:0%
because everything we do in this room
 
04:54:30.430 --> 04:54:30.440 align:start position:0%
matters to uh matters Statewide so we
 
04:54:33.590 --> 04:54:33.600 align:start position:0%
have statewide responsibilities so so um
 
04:54:36.948 --> 04:54:36.958 align:start position:0%
anyway so uh Mart County 9 here to
 
04:54:40.830 --> 04:54:40.840 align:start position:0%
introduce house bill um uh 550 so
 
04:54:43.948 --> 04:54:43.958 align:start position:0%
so before I get into uh to the bill I
 
04:54:45.830 --> 04:54:45.840 align:start position:0%
just want to um just sort of take
 
04:54:47.750 --> 04:54:47.760 align:start position:0%
everybody through uh through a little
 
04:54:49.830 --> 04:54:49.840 align:start position:0%
bit of brief history what we're what
 
04:54:52.830 --> 04:54:52.840 align:start position:0%
we're looking at here is a bill that is
 
04:54:55.990 --> 04:54:56.000 align:start position:0%
in response to the uh the lower courts
 
04:54:58.990 --> 04:54:59.000 align:start position:0%
decision in the conval uh lawsuit and I
 
04:55:00.948 --> 04:55:00.958 align:start position:0%
think everybody around the table here
 
04:55:04.030 --> 04:55:04.040 align:start position:0%
prob probably is pretty aware of what uh
 
04:55:05.670 --> 04:55:05.680 align:start position:0%
you know what went into the conal
 
04:55:08.230 --> 04:55:08.240 align:start position:0%
lawsuit what it's what it's all about
 
04:55:09.910 --> 04:55:09.920 align:start position:0%
and uh but I will I will talk a little
 
04:55:11.350 --> 04:55:11.360 align:start position:0%
bit about some of the things that were
 
04:55:14.350 --> 04:55:14.360 align:start position:0%
in the the lower Court's order but the
 
04:55:17.708 --> 04:55:17.718 align:start position:0%
um uh the lawsuit was filed back in
 
04:55:21.110 --> 04:55:21.120 align:start position:0%
2019 um uh where the uh where the The
 
04:55:23.430 --> 04:55:23.440 align:start position:0%
conell Cooperative School District sued
 
04:55:25.910 --> 04:55:25.920 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire and others um
 
04:55:29.750 --> 04:55:29.760 align:start position:0%
with respect to the base cost base cost
 
04:55:32.708 --> 04:55:32.718 align:start position:0%
of an adequate education so this is the
 
04:55:35.948 --> 04:55:35.958 align:start position:0%
the the top of the of our current school
 
04:55:38.510 --> 04:55:38.520 align:start position:0%
funding formula associated with the base
 
04:55:40.750 --> 04:55:40.760 align:start position:0%
cost of inadequate education
 
04:55:43.350 --> 04:55:43.360 align:start position:0%
um uh that trial went on for uh took a
 
04:55:46.030 --> 04:55:46.040 align:start position:0%
little while and then in uh in
 
04:55:49.430 --> 04:55:49.440 align:start position:0%
2023 the uh Superior Court um ruled in
 
04:55:53.750 --> 04:55:53.760 align:start position:0%
favor of the plaintiffs and um uh and
 
04:55:57.350 --> 04:55:57.360 align:start position:0%
basically in that order they um you know
 
04:55:59.270 --> 04:55:59.280 align:start position:0%
they took a look at uh you know they
 
04:56:02.150 --> 04:56:02.160 align:start position:0%
listened to a lot of expert testimony uh
 
04:56:03.910 --> 04:56:03.920 align:start position:0%
experts including Kimberly Rizzo
 
04:56:05.990 --> 04:56:06.000 align:start position:0%
Saunders who was the former um
 
04:56:09.230 --> 04:56:09.240 align:start position:0%
superintendent uh at conal who had uh
 
04:56:12.150 --> 04:56:12.160 align:start position:0%
sort of laid out um uh logic and
 
04:56:15.948 --> 04:56:15.958 align:start position:0%
reasoning behind a base cost of um
 
04:56:19.670 --> 04:56:19.680 align:start position:0%
$929 which lined up very very very close
 
04:56:22.750 --> 04:56:22.760 align:start position:0%
to that of uh another expert uh Dr Bruce
 
04:56:26.910 --> 04:56:26.920 align:start position:0%
Baker um who um who testified that uh
 
04:56:28.830 --> 04:56:28.840 align:start position:0%
that a base cost in New Hampshire given
 
04:56:30.868 --> 04:56:30.878 align:start position:0%
all the things that go into public
 
04:56:33.510 --> 04:56:33.520 align:start position:0%
school public education uh would have a
 
04:56:36.230 --> 04:56:36.240 align:start position:0%
base cost of about
 
04:56:40.270 --> 04:56:40.280 align:start position:0%
9964 uh at the end of the day the uh the
 
04:56:43.868 --> 04:56:43.878 align:start position:0%
Court um uh came up with a conservative
 
04:56:47.788 --> 04:56:47.798 align:start position:0%
minimum threshold uh of
 
04:56:49.948 --> 04:56:49.958 align:start position:0%
$735 and because everybody's probably
 
04:56:52.868 --> 04:56:52.878 align:start position:0%
seen the one cent uh after that too I'll
 
04:56:54.510 --> 04:56:54.520 align:start position:0%
just mention it here but I won't mention
 
04:56:57.430 --> 04:56:57.440 align:start position:0%
that anymore um as a as a conservative
 
04:56:59.830 --> 04:56:59.840 align:start position:0%
minimum threshold for base costs per
 
04:57:03.590 --> 04:57:03.600 align:start position:0%
pupil for an adequate education um and
 
04:57:06.670 --> 04:57:06.680 align:start position:0%
um uh but State didn't like that and so
 
04:57:08.750 --> 04:57:08.760 align:start position:0%
it appealed it to the Supreme Court and
 
04:57:10.750 --> 04:57:10.760 align:start position:0%
that's where the uh the case
 
04:57:16.390 --> 04:57:16.400 align:start position:0%
sits now um in um uh in I believe it was
 
04:57:18.628 --> 04:57:18.638 align:start position:0%
December may have been November November
 
04:57:22.350 --> 04:57:22.360 align:start position:0%
December 2024 The Supremes uh heard oral
 
04:57:25.190 --> 04:57:25.200 align:start position:0%
arguments and we're now awaiting their
 
04:57:28.990 --> 04:57:29.000 align:start position:0%
um their decision um uh upon appeal so
 
04:57:31.230 --> 04:57:31.240 align:start position:0%
so anyway that's the uh that's the brief
 
04:57:33.628 --> 04:57:33.638 align:start position:0%
history let me talk just a second about
 
04:57:35.470 --> 04:57:35.480 align:start position:0%
what the convel Cooperative School
 
04:57:37.548 --> 04:57:37.558 align:start position:0%
District uh is all about and the
 
04:57:40.150 --> 04:57:40.160 align:start position:0%
plaintiffs in this case so um convel
 
04:57:42.150 --> 04:57:42.160 align:start position:0%
operative School District constitutes
 
04:57:44.830 --> 04:57:44.840 align:start position:0%
the towns of um Anam Bennington Dublin
 
04:57:47.230 --> 04:57:47.240 align:start position:0%
Francis Town Greenfield Hancock
 
04:57:51.868 --> 04:57:51.878 align:start position:0%
Peterboro Sharon Temple uh did I miss
 
04:57:55.070 --> 04:57:55.080 align:start position:0%
any so it's a lot of towns it's a big uh
 
04:57:58.910 --> 04:57:58.920 align:start position:0%
it's a big Co-op but very impressively
 
04:58:03.070 --> 04:58:03.080 align:start position:0%
they've been joined uh by other um um uh
 
04:58:04.910 --> 04:58:04.920 align:start position:0%
uh school districts across the state who
 
04:58:06.868 --> 04:58:06.878 align:start position:0%
have joined as plaintiffs in this
 
04:58:09.548 --> 04:58:09.558 align:start position:0%
lawsuit and together conal and the
 
04:58:12.350 --> 04:58:12.360 align:start position:0%
plaintiff uh school districts educate AO
 
04:58:15.390 --> 04:58:15.400 align:start position:0%
approximately 25% of all public school
 
04:58:20.070 --> 04:58:20.080 align:start position:0%
kids um uh here in New Hampshire so um
 
04:58:22.510 --> 04:58:22.520 align:start position:0%
so the bill we're looking at here House
 
04:58:25.430 --> 04:58:25.440 align:start position:0%
Bill 550 uh is filed as part of a
 
04:58:28.590 --> 04:58:28.600 align:start position:0%
package of uh of school funding uh
 
04:58:31.830 --> 04:58:31.840 align:start position:0%
legislation and um and U you know the
 
04:58:34.910 --> 04:58:34.920 align:start position:0%
one here modifies the base um uh the
 
04:58:37.470 --> 04:58:37.480 align:start position:0%
base Grant in conville but we'll be
 
04:58:39.750 --> 04:58:39.760 align:start position:0%
seeing other bills as well they haven't
 
04:58:41.830 --> 04:58:41.840 align:start position:0%
received received um Bill numbers yet
 
04:58:44.230 --> 04:58:44.240 align:start position:0%
they're still at the LSR number level
 
04:58:46.868 --> 04:58:46.878 align:start position:0%
but there's one that responds to Rand
 
04:58:49.390 --> 04:58:49.400 align:start position:0%
with another lawsuit with uh with
 
04:58:52.830 --> 04:58:52.840 align:start position:0%
changes to the differential uh Aid which
 
04:58:55.310 --> 04:58:55.320 align:start position:0%
is the other part of the uh the formula
 
04:58:58.390 --> 04:58:58.400 align:start position:0%
we see um uh we see on the books and um
 
04:59:00.430 --> 04:59:00.440 align:start position:0%
and another bill with respect to special
 
04:59:03.190 --> 04:59:03.200 align:start position:0%
education Aid which has been prated
 
04:59:04.750 --> 04:59:04.760 align:start position:0%
although that may be in a little bit of
 
04:59:08.110 --> 04:59:08.120 align:start position:0%
flux right now um and also a bill that
 
04:59:10.548 --> 04:59:10.558 align:start position:0%
is really comprehensive in nature
 
04:59:13.430 --> 04:59:13.440 align:start position:0%
in terms of reforming how we uh we fund
 
04:59:15.750 --> 04:59:15.760 align:start position:0%
schools in New Hampshire and I'll and I
 
04:59:17.830 --> 04:59:17.840 align:start position:0%
do want to talk a little bit about um
 
04:59:21.190 --> 04:59:21.200 align:start position:0%
about that but um but the uh the funding
 
04:59:24.590 --> 04:59:24.600 align:start position:0%
formulas that are in all of these bills
 
04:59:26.230 --> 04:59:26.240 align:start position:0%
the one we're looking at here the one
 
04:59:28.350 --> 04:59:28.360 align:start position:0%
that does differentiated Aid and the one
 
04:59:30.590 --> 04:59:30.600 align:start position:0%
that does comprehensive are all talked
 
04:59:33.190 --> 04:59:33.200 align:start position:0%
about in the 2020 school funding
 
04:59:36.110 --> 04:59:36.120 align:start position:0%
commission report and uh we have more of
 
04:59:38.708 --> 04:59:38.718 align:start position:0%
these reports in hard copy in the U in
 
04:59:40.470 --> 04:59:40.480 align:start position:0%
the committee office uh they're
 
04:59:40.480 --> 04:59:41.590 align:start position:0%
the committee office uh they're
available

04:59:41.590 --> 04:59:41.600 align:start position:0%
available
 
04:59:45.750 --> 04:59:45.760 align:start position:0%
online uh for anybody to download um uh
 
04:59:48.788 --> 04:59:48.798 align:start position:0%
through the uh the UNH Cary school and
 
04:59:51.590 --> 04:59:51.600 align:start position:0%
um and and actually the while the report
 
04:59:53.230 --> 04:59:53.240 align:start position:0%
you know I don't know it's you know sort
 
04:59:55.830 --> 04:59:55.840 align:start position:0%
of half inch thickish type of type of
 
04:59:57.628 --> 04:59:57.638 align:start position:0%
thing couple you know hundred Pages or
 
05:00:02.310 --> 05:00:02.320 align:start position:0%
so is uh is is is is is supported and
 
05:00:04.708 --> 05:00:04.718 align:start position:0%
probably the most important um uh
 
05:00:07.750 --> 05:00:07.760 align:start position:0%
archive from the commission's work are
 
05:00:10.470 --> 05:00:10.480 align:start position:0%
are in these these you know work
 
05:00:13.750 --> 05:00:13.760 align:start position:0%
um you know pamphlets that that drill
 
05:00:17.350 --> 05:00:17.360 align:start position:0%
down into uh into spec specific areas
 
05:00:19.310 --> 05:00:19.320 align:start position:0%
and really constitute the evidence
 
05:00:22.110 --> 05:00:22.120 align:start position:0%
behind um uh what's between um what
 
05:00:24.310 --> 05:00:24.320 align:start position:0%
what's on the pages of this report here
 
05:00:27.628 --> 05:00:27.638 align:start position:0%
but I'd be I'd be absolutely happy to to
 
05:00:30.830 --> 05:00:30.840 align:start position:0%
go through it one-on-one or in in groups
 
05:00:32.750 --> 05:00:32.760 align:start position:0%
with uh with any of the members on on
 
05:00:34.750 --> 05:00:34.760 align:start position:0%
this committee you know as we as we
 
05:00:38.070 --> 05:00:38.080 align:start position:0%
really sort of get into the the mode of
 
05:00:40.470 --> 05:00:40.480 align:start position:0%
um of studying and
 
05:00:43.270 --> 05:00:43.280 align:start position:0%
of you know these multiple uh uh school
 
05:00:45.868 --> 05:00:45.878 align:start position:0%
funding bills and determining what what
 
05:00:48.310 --> 05:00:48.320 align:start position:0%
sort of solution we may um we may want
 
05:00:52.470 --> 05:00:52.480 align:start position:0%
to put uh put forward um but but you
 
05:00:55.670 --> 05:00:55.680 align:start position:0%
know really simple what's in this couple
 
05:00:57.750 --> 05:00:57.760 align:start position:0%
hundred Pages here boils down to the
 
05:01:00.270 --> 05:01:00.280 align:start position:0%
fact that um that our current school
 
05:01:02.510 --> 05:01:02.520 align:start position:0%
funding formula isn't getting the job
 
05:01:05.470 --> 05:01:05.480 align:start position:0%
done for um uh for students and
 
05:01:07.868 --> 05:01:07.878 align:start position:0%
taxpayers and um and it does make
 
05:01:09.628 --> 05:01:09.638 align:start position:0%
findings and recommendations about how
 
05:01:11.910 --> 05:01:11.920 align:start position:0%
we can can uh improve student outcomes
 
05:01:15.628 --> 05:01:15.638 align:start position:0%
through through proper use or better use
 
05:01:18.350 --> 05:01:18.360 align:start position:0%
let me say it that way better use of uh
 
05:01:20.830 --> 05:01:20.840 align:start position:0%
of State funds and uh and also be more
 
05:01:24.110 --> 05:01:24.120 align:start position:0%
fair to uh to taxpayers at the same time
 
05:01:26.110 --> 05:01:26.120 align:start position:0%
so the bill
 
05:01:30.670 --> 05:01:30.680 align:start position:0%
itself let sort of swing into it here um
 
05:01:33.548 --> 05:01:33.558 align:start position:0%
it uh it makes change on line seven
 
05:01:36.110 --> 05:01:36.120 align:start position:0%
that's right in the uh in the Statue of
 
05:01:38.510 --> 05:01:38.520 align:start position:0%
1984a which is right where our school
 
05:01:41.030 --> 05:01:41.040 align:start position:0%
funding formula is and it's a change in
 
05:01:43.788 --> 05:01:43.798 align:start position:0%
in the first number in that statute from
 
05:01:43.798 --> 05:01:44.510 align:start position:0%
in the first number in that statute from
about

05:01:44.510 --> 05:01:44.520 align:start position:0%
about
 
05:01:48.628 --> 05:01:48.638 align:start position:0%
$4,100 although in in in in the current
 
05:01:51.390 --> 05:01:51.400 align:start position:0%
Year's in I'm sorry in FY
 
05:01:54.708 --> 05:01:54.718 align:start position:0%
26's um uh budget year which is already
 
05:01:56.470 --> 05:01:56.480 align:start position:0%
on the you know we're we're we're
 
05:01:58.310 --> 05:01:58.320 align:start position:0%
already doing school meetings right to
 
05:02:01.470 --> 05:02:01.480 align:start position:0%
to get into that um that that has gone
 
05:02:04.230 --> 05:02:04.240 align:start position:0%
through CPI cost escalators so it's not
 
05:02:05.628 --> 05:02:05.638 align:start position:0%
4100 it's
 
05:02:10.030 --> 05:02:10.040 align:start position:0%
4265 and so it up it updates that to the
 
05:02:13.830 --> 05:02:13.840 align:start position:0%
356 that the convel court um uh uh
 
05:02:17.670 --> 05:02:17.680 align:start position:0%
ordered but um but just as important as
 
05:02:20.230 --> 05:02:20.240 align:start position:0%
that is I think is an addition we made
 
05:02:21.830 --> 05:02:21.840 align:start position:0%
to 193
 
05:02:24.590 --> 05:02:24.600 align:start position:0%
e2a uh with respect to the cost of an
 
05:02:27.070 --> 05:02:27.080 align:start position:0%
adequate education and this is what this
 
05:02:31.430 --> 05:02:31.440 align:start position:0%
is what's in the statute now uh to tell
 
05:02:34.510 --> 05:02:34.520 align:start position:0%
the legislature how it what what sort of
 
05:02:37.030 --> 05:02:37.040 align:start position:0%
things to consider when costing out an
 
05:02:39.590 --> 05:02:39.600 align:start position:0%
adequate education and the current the
 
05:02:42.190 --> 05:02:42.200 align:start position:0%
current current statute calls out but
 
05:02:43.350 --> 05:02:43.360 align:start position:0%
does not
 
05:02:45.670 --> 05:02:45.680 align:start position:0%
articulate um uh what are called
 
05:02:48.670 --> 05:02:48.680 align:start position:0%
necessary specific resource elements and
 
05:02:51.270 --> 05:02:51.280 align:start position:0%
so that may be you know sort of parlance
 
05:02:54.230 --> 05:02:54.240 align:start position:0%
that's in our in our statute today uh
 
05:02:56.670 --> 05:02:56.680 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure if if those that specific
 
05:02:59.628 --> 05:02:59.638 align:start position:0%
term is in the um uh the lower Court's
 
05:03:02.310 --> 05:03:02.320 align:start position:0%
conval uh decision but the lower court
 
05:03:04.830 --> 05:03:04.840 align:start position:0%
the conval decision does
 
05:03:07.948 --> 05:03:07.958 align:start position:0%
specifically look at uh specific
 
05:03:10.470 --> 05:03:10.480 align:start position:0%
necessary specific resource
 
05:03:12.590 --> 05:03:12.600 align:start position:0%
when calculating that
 
05:03:15.708 --> 05:03:15.718 align:start position:0%
7356 and so so I'll sort of read read
 
05:03:17.868 --> 05:03:17.878 align:start position:0%
the top of it but I won't keep going now
 
05:03:20.070 --> 05:03:20.080 align:start position:0%
shall include the cost for teachers
 
05:03:23.390 --> 05:03:23.400 align:start position:0%
teacher benefits um uh student teacher
 
05:03:25.270 --> 05:03:25.280 align:start position:0%
ratios principles administrative
 
05:03:28.030 --> 05:03:28.040 align:start position:0%
assistance school counselors uh talks
 
05:03:30.470 --> 05:03:30.480 align:start position:0%
about facility operation and maintenance
 
05:03:31.948 --> 05:03:31.958 align:start position:0%
which was something I think denied by
 
05:03:34.030 --> 05:03:34.040 align:start position:0%
the state during or oral arguments where
 
05:03:37.548 --> 05:03:37.558 align:start position:0%
they said nope heat isn't included so um
 
05:03:40.270 --> 05:03:40.280 align:start position:0%
so this makes it abundantly clear that
 
05:03:42.470 --> 05:03:42.480 align:start position:0%
that all of the elements that at least
 
05:03:44.830 --> 05:03:44.840 align:start position:0%
the elements that were um that were
 
05:03:47.830 --> 05:03:47.840 align:start position:0%
required by the uh the ru off Court um
 
05:03:50.030 --> 05:03:50.040 align:start position:0%
are to be included in the calculation of
 
05:03:52.750 --> 05:03:52.760 align:start position:0%
the um the the base cost uh for an
 
05:03:54.510 --> 05:03:54.520 align:start position:0%
adequate U
 
05:03:59.230 --> 05:03:59.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:59.240 --> 05:04:00.990 align:start position:0%
 
see

05:04:00.990 --> 05:04:01.000 align:start position:0%
see
 
05:04:04.310 --> 05:04:04.320 align:start position:0%
so all right I don't want to um there's
 
05:04:05.270 --> 05:04:05.280 align:start position:0%
there's going to be some people that are
 
05:04:07.430 --> 05:04:07.440 align:start position:0%
going to speak after me and and um and
 
05:04:13.070 --> 05:04:13.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:13.080 --> 05:04:14.590 align:start position:0%
 
bill

05:04:14.590 --> 05:04:14.600 align:start position:0%
bill
 
05:04:17.310 --> 05:04:17.320 align:start position:0%
yeah let's just let him finish yeah yeah
 
05:04:19.110 --> 05:04:19.120 align:start position:0%
and yeah I'm and I'm getting to I'm
 
05:04:20.948 --> 05:04:20.958 align:start position:0%
getting to the concluding the the
 
05:04:23.910 --> 05:04:23.920 align:start position:0%
introduction on on this but but but I
 
05:04:25.350 --> 05:04:25.360 align:start position:0%
was really interested in getting to the
 
05:04:29.030 --> 05:04:29.040 align:start position:0%
fiscal note and and not all the bills
 
05:04:32.110 --> 05:04:32.120 align:start position:0%
that I've put in are necessarily
 
05:04:34.510 --> 05:04:34.520 align:start position:0%
compatible with with each
 
05:04:36.670 --> 05:04:36.680 align:start position:0%
other this one's important because
 
05:04:38.788 --> 05:04:38.798 align:start position:0%
there's a court case Rand is important
 
05:04:40.190 --> 05:04:40.200 align:start position:0%
because there's a court case
 
05:04:42.470 --> 05:04:42.480 align:start position:0%
comprehensive Equitable school funding
 
05:04:44.270 --> 05:04:44.280 align:start position:0%
is important because that's actually
 
05:04:46.430 --> 05:04:46.440 align:start position:0%
what what came out of our our commission
 
05:04:48.270 --> 05:04:48.280 align:start position:0%
work and we want to all be able to look
 
05:04:50.548 --> 05:04:50.558 align:start position:0%
at all of them but we need to be able to
 
05:04:53.190 --> 05:04:53.200 align:start position:0%
look at fiscal notes associated with all
 
05:04:55.110 --> 05:04:55.120 align:start position:0%
of them too and so the fiscal note on
 
05:04:57.548 --> 05:04:57.558 align:start position:0%
this one comes out at nearly $500
 
05:05:01.270 --> 05:05:01.280 align:start position:0%
million um real important to recognize
 
05:05:04.548 --> 05:05:04.558 align:start position:0%
that our current funding formula um is a
 
05:05:07.590 --> 05:05:07.600 align:start position:0%
flat funding formula and um it which
 
05:05:09.830 --> 05:05:09.840 align:start position:0%
means that every school district
 
05:05:12.430 --> 05:05:12.440 align:start position:0%
receives the same base adequacy amount
 
05:05:14.150 --> 05:05:14.160 align:start position:0%
and frankly all the differentiated Aid
 
05:05:16.948 --> 05:05:16.958 align:start position:0%
amounts as well per uh per pupil that
 
05:05:19.030 --> 05:05:19.040 align:start position:0%
that quad qualify for the differentiated
 
05:05:21.470 --> 05:05:21.480 align:start position:0%
but every pupil qualifies every student
 
05:05:25.190 --> 05:05:25.200 align:start position:0%
qualifies for the um uh for the base so
 
05:05:28.830 --> 05:05:28.840 align:start position:0%
so every student in every district is
 
05:05:30.708 --> 05:05:30.718 align:start position:0%
going to well every district is going to
 
05:05:33.230 --> 05:05:33.240 align:start position:0%
receive an additional 30 under this bill
 
05:05:34.350 --> 05:05:34.360 align:start position:0%
an additional
 
05:05:38.230 --> 05:05:38.240 align:start position:0%
$3,200 per student so for Newport that's
 
05:05:42.150 --> 05:05:42.160 align:start position:0%
an additional 32 $200 per student on top
 
05:05:43.948 --> 05:05:43.958 align:start position:0%
of the FY
 
05:05:47.548 --> 05:05:47.558 align:start position:0%
26 uh funding of $1
 
05:05:50.590 --> 05:05:50.600 align:start position:0%
13,25 by the state to Newport for the
 
05:05:53.708 --> 05:05:53.718 align:start position:0%
student in Newcastle it's
 
05:05:58.310 --> 05:05:58.320 align:start position:0%
$3,200 more per student on top of
 
05:06:00.708 --> 05:06:00.718 align:start position:0%
the $
 
05:06:05.110 --> 05:06:05.120 align:start position:0%
38,3 53 per puple that it receives from
 
05:06:08.788 --> 05:06:08.798 align:start position:0%
the state and I didn't misread that
 
05:06:08.798 --> 05:06:10.750 align:start position:0%
the state and I didn't misread that
13,000

05:06:10.750 --> 05:06:10.760 align:start position:0%
13,000
 
05:06:13.470 --> 05:06:13.480 align:start position:0%
per student for Newport 38,000 per
 
05:06:16.310 --> 05:06:16.320 align:start position:0%
student from the state and Newcastle
 
05:06:20.070 --> 05:06:20.080 align:start position:0%
it's one size fits-all 3,200 bucks more
 
05:06:22.350 --> 05:06:22.360 align:start position:0%
for everybody no matter um no matter
 
05:06:26.470 --> 05:06:26.480 align:start position:0%
where you live and um and it doesn't
 
05:06:28.390 --> 05:06:28.400 align:start position:0%
take into
 
05:06:31.150 --> 05:06:31.160 align:start position:0%
consideration um any of the sort of the
 
05:06:33.990 --> 05:06:34.000 align:start position:0%
cost differentials that we uh that we
 
05:06:36.590 --> 05:06:36.600 align:start position:0%
see across the state you know Manchester
 
05:06:38.948 --> 05:06:38.958 align:start position:0%
is a great example you know they've got
 
05:06:40.868 --> 05:06:40.878 align:start position:0%
they've got a student body of nearly
 
05:06:44.270 --> 05:06:44.280 align:start position:0%
what over 12,000 students 72 um
 
05:06:46.390 --> 05:06:46.400 align:start position:0%
different languages are spoken 60% of
 
05:06:48.310 --> 05:06:48.320 align:start position:0%
the kids live at come in low income
 
05:06:50.430 --> 05:06:50.440 align:start position:0%
backgrounds that's very different than a
 
05:06:52.548 --> 05:06:52.558 align:start position:0%
lot of other uh towns across the state
 
05:06:55.750 --> 05:06:55.760 align:start position:0%
and I think um um uh you know anyway
 
05:06:58.270 --> 05:06:58.280 align:start position:0%
we'll be talking about um uh more later
 
05:07:00.270 --> 05:07:00.280 align:start position:0%
and and uh and certainly access to
 
05:07:02.230 --> 05:07:02.240 align:start position:0%
financial resources is not something
 
05:07:04.910 --> 05:07:04.920 align:start position:0%
that this bill contemplates others do
 
05:07:10.548 --> 05:07:10.558 align:start position:0%
this one does not so um uh the um the
 
05:07:13.390 --> 05:07:13.400 align:start position:0%
fiscal node also documents how our
 
05:07:16.270 --> 05:07:16.280 align:start position:0%
current funding formula Cascades down to
 
05:07:20.270 --> 05:07:20.280 align:start position:0%
Charters and vouchers um and um and and
 
05:07:22.548 --> 05:07:22.558 align:start position:0%
why is that uh why is that important
 
05:07:25.190 --> 05:07:25.200 align:start position:0%
because charter schools and um and
 
05:07:27.788 --> 05:07:27.798 align:start position:0%
voucher um uh programs are not
 
05:07:30.350 --> 05:07:30.360 align:start position:0%
accountable to the necessary resource
 
05:07:33.030 --> 05:07:33.040 align:start position:0%
elements that are articulated by the
 
05:07:35.430 --> 05:07:35.440 align:start position:0%
court and articulated in this bill in
 
05:07:37.310 --> 05:07:37.320 align:start position:0%
calculating the co the base cost of an
 
05:07:40.470 --> 05:07:40.480 align:start position:0%
adequate education so BAS basically uh
 
05:07:42.548 --> 05:07:42.558 align:start position:0%
in summary this bill amends the state's
 
05:07:44.868 --> 05:07:44.878 align:start position:0%
one- siiz fits-all formula to comply
 
05:07:47.270 --> 05:07:47.280 align:start position:0%
with the minimum threshold defined by
 
05:07:51.868 --> 05:07:51.878 align:start position:0%
the conal order um the um uh you know
 
05:07:54.510 --> 05:07:54.520 align:start position:0%
the current funding formula uh as well
 
05:07:58.628 --> 05:07:58.638 align:start position:0%
as um as others are presented in detail
 
05:08:01.990 --> 05:08:02.000 align:start position:0%
in um in the 2020 school funding report
 
05:08:05.548 --> 05:08:05.558 align:start position:0%
and uh uh and again um uh we can see how
 
05:08:07.510 --> 05:08:07.520 align:start position:0%
though that you know different ways
 
05:08:08.990 --> 05:08:09.000 align:start position:0%
turning different knobs different
 
05:08:09.000 --> 05:08:10.110 align:start position:0%
turning different knobs different
directions

05:08:10.110 --> 05:08:10.120 align:start position:0%
directions
 
05:08:11.910 --> 05:08:11.920 align:start position:0%
can uh can make a big difference for
 
05:08:14.150 --> 05:08:14.160 align:start position:0%
student outcomes and for taxpayer equity
 
05:08:16.750 --> 05:08:16.760 align:start position:0%
and i' be happy to talk one-on-one or in
 
05:08:19.150 --> 05:08:19.160 align:start position:0%
small groups with anybody would like to
 
05:08:20.948 --> 05:08:20.958 align:start position:0%
uh like to do more copies are available
 
05:08:24.190 --> 05:08:24.200 align:start position:0%
in the office that's what I got very
 
05:08:25.990 --> 05:08:26.000 align:start position:0%
good good introduction uh before I take
 
05:08:28.510 --> 05:08:28.520 align:start position:0%
any questions I just want to for
 
05:08:31.990 --> 05:08:32.000 align:start position:0%
everybody's uh benefit as representative
 
05:08:34.548 --> 05:08:34.558 align:start position:0%
luno said this is one of a package of
 
05:08:37.708 --> 05:08:37.718 align:start position:0%
bills uh that correct he is personally
 
05:08:40.350 --> 05:08:40.360 align:start position:0%
on a number and there are others so
 
05:08:42.750 --> 05:08:42.760 align:start position:0%
the the the chore for this afternoon is
 
05:08:45.510 --> 05:08:45.520 align:start position:0%
to make sure we understand this bill not
 
05:08:47.708 --> 05:08:47.718 align:start position:0%
to get into a comprehensive examination
 
05:08:50.230 --> 05:08:50.240 align:start position:0%
of adequacy we will have work sessions
 
05:08:52.470 --> 05:08:52.480 align:start position:0%
we'll have hearings on other bills uh
 
05:08:54.190 --> 05:08:54.200 align:start position:0%
this is going to be a major Focus for us
 
05:08:56.470 --> 05:08:56.480 align:start position:0%
for the coming two months so
 
05:08:58.868 --> 05:08:58.878 align:start position:0%
representative papich Miller thank you
 
05:09:01.270 --> 05:09:01.280 align:start position:0%
very much Mr chairman and I just wanted
 
05:09:03.590 --> 05:09:03.600 align:start position:0%
to state that it was in no way my intend
 
05:09:05.390 --> 05:09:05.400 align:start position:0%
to interrupt the speaker or would I ever
 
05:09:06.948 --> 05:09:06.958 align:start position:0%
interrupt another speaker I just wanted
 
05:09:08.910 --> 05:09:08.920 align:start position:0%
to get your attention to know that I
 
05:09:10.788 --> 05:09:10.798 align:start position:0%
have a question whenever the right time
 
05:09:13.150 --> 05:09:13.160 align:start position:0%
shows up and thank you for taking the
 
05:09:16.150 --> 05:09:16.160 align:start position:0%
questiones representative I'm not going
 
05:09:17.990 --> 05:09:18.000 align:start position:0%
to bring up the dollars yet because it
 
05:09:20.150 --> 05:09:20.160 align:start position:0%
is premature to even go there right now
 
05:09:21.510 --> 05:09:21.520 align:start position:0%
but I did have a question about the
 
05:09:23.590 --> 05:09:23.600 align:start position:0%
language you have in line 18 and 19
 
05:09:25.150 --> 05:09:25.160 align:start position:0%
that's the very last phrase in there
 
05:09:27.270 --> 05:09:27.280 align:start position:0%
that says the general court shall use
 
05:09:29.070 --> 05:09:29.080 align:start position:0%
evidence for actual cost for all
 
05:09:30.670 --> 05:09:30.680 align:start position:0%
approved schools to determine the cost
 
05:09:33.670 --> 05:09:33.680 align:start position:0%
of an adequate education I'm trying to
 
05:09:35.670 --> 05:09:35.680 align:start position:0%
understand given that there are schools
 
05:09:38.548 --> 05:09:38.558 align:start position:0%
that we situation in the 30s and 40s a
 
05:09:40.990 --> 05:09:41.000 align:start position:0%
year and uh who knows we may approach
 
05:09:43.470 --> 05:09:43.480 align:start position:0%
Northeastern University levels in the
 
05:09:47.670 --> 05:09:47.680 align:start position:0%
60s how do you think that the general
 
05:09:51.150 --> 05:09:51.160 align:start position:0%
court should take those actual costs and
 
05:09:54.470 --> 05:09:54.480 align:start position:0%
reach the cost of an adequate education
 
05:09:56.590 --> 05:09:56.600 align:start position:0%
do we consider every one of those cost
 
05:09:58.350 --> 05:09:58.360 align:start position:0%
part an adequate do we recognize that
 
05:10:01.390 --> 05:10:01.400 align:start position:0%
some schools have you know expectations
 
05:10:03.948 --> 05:10:03.958 align:start position:0%
that go Way Beyond adequate I I'm just
 
05:10:05.628 --> 05:10:05.638 align:start position:0%
trying to understand the intent that you
 
05:10:07.510 --> 05:10:07.520 align:start position:0%
have as a prime sponsor yeah no that's
 
05:10:09.310 --> 05:10:09.320 align:start position:0%
thank you very much um representative
 
05:10:13.310 --> 05:10:13.320 align:start position:0%
for the for the question um uh the um
 
05:10:15.910 --> 05:10:15.920 align:start position:0%
the the actual cost that the that the
 
05:10:20.788 --> 05:10:20.798 align:start position:0%
state collects um is is some is is is is
 
05:10:22.948 --> 05:10:22.958 align:start position:0%
is now pretty pretty you know complete
 
05:10:24.510 --> 05:10:24.520 align:start position:0%
pretty comprehensive we've got it we've
 
05:10:27.350 --> 05:10:27.360 align:start position:0%
got it going back now for at least the
 
05:10:30.190 --> 05:10:30.200 align:start position:0%
last 10 to 20 years and uh and it's
 
05:10:31.628 --> 05:10:31.638 align:start position:0%
something we can look at we can
 
05:10:34.788 --> 05:10:34.798 align:start position:0%
something that we can see the costs of
 
05:10:36.590 --> 05:10:36.600 align:start position:0%
of certain things whether it's regular
 
05:10:38.788 --> 05:10:38.798 align:start position:0%
education in line 1200 or special
 
05:10:43.070 --> 05:10:43.080 align:start position:0%
education in line 1300 or um um athletic
 
05:10:45.708 --> 05:10:45.718 align:start position:0%
programs and it's all Broken Out In much
 
05:10:47.830 --> 05:10:47.840 align:start position:0%
greater detail than than I have in front
 
05:10:50.150 --> 05:10:50.160 align:start position:0%
of me right now but uh but certainly
 
05:10:51.868 --> 05:10:51.878 align:start position:0%
people from the Department would be able
 
05:10:54.548 --> 05:10:54.558 align:start position:0%
to to speak to exactly uh what
 
05:10:57.230 --> 05:10:57.240 align:start position:0%
information's collected when you compare
 
05:11:00.750 --> 05:11:00.760 align:start position:0%
that with our cost per pupil in some
 
05:11:04.788 --> 05:11:04.798 align:start position:0%
districts that in some cases is is uh
 
05:11:07.750 --> 05:11:07.760 align:start position:0%
could be as a result of very unusual
 
05:11:10.030 --> 05:11:10.040 align:start position:0%
costs that perhaps very large
 
05:11:12.390 --> 05:11:12.400 align:start position:0%
Cooperative districts might uh might be
 
05:11:15.270 --> 05:11:15.280 align:start position:0%
facing in terms of Transportation or it
 
05:11:18.948 --> 05:11:18.958 align:start position:0%
could actually be part of very unusual
 
05:11:21.948 --> 05:11:21.958 align:start position:0%
strange aspects of New Hampshire's
 
05:11:26.628 --> 05:11:26.638 align:start position:0%
school funding uh design which um which
 
05:11:31.070 --> 05:11:31.080 align:start position:0%
provides uh um Newcastle with
 
05:11:34.470 --> 05:11:34.480 align:start position:0%
$38,000 per student per year in New
 
05:11:37.510 --> 05:11:37.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Public taxpayer dollars not
 
05:11:40.948 --> 05:11:40.958 align:start position:0%
local new Newcastle property taxes but
 
05:11:44.110 --> 05:11:44.120 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire New Hampshire um uh tax
 
05:11:47.708 --> 05:11:47.718 align:start position:0%
dollars so so you know when when when
 
05:11:49.990 --> 05:11:50.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is funding Newcastle
 
05:11:53.310 --> 05:11:53.320 align:start position:0%
$38,000 a year um that certainly could
 
05:11:56.830 --> 05:11:56.840 align:start position:0%
have uh could could reflect in higher
 
05:11:58.750 --> 05:11:58.760 align:start position:0%
than average significantly higher than
 
05:12:00.990 --> 05:12:01.000 align:start position:0%
average per pupil cost in terms of how
 
05:12:04.150 --> 05:12:04.160 align:start position:0%
they go about operating their um their
 
05:12:06.708 --> 05:12:06.718 align:start position:0%
their uh Public
 
05:12:09.708 --> 05:12:09.718 align:start position:0%
Schools quick notifications yes I
 
05:12:12.548 --> 05:12:12.558 align:start position:0%
appreciate the context you provided do
 
05:12:14.788 --> 05:12:14.798 align:start position:0%
you have any thoughts over whether again
 
05:12:17.030 --> 05:12:17.040 align:start position:0%
this is intended to say that all costs
 
05:12:18.788 --> 05:12:18.798 align:start position:0%
incurred by the schools should counter
 
05:12:21.310 --> 05:12:21.320 align:start position:0%
the adequate and if not how would the
 
05:12:24.350 --> 05:12:24.360 align:start position:0%
General Court decide what's necessary
 
05:12:26.230 --> 05:12:26.240 align:start position:0%
for an adequate education and what is
 
05:12:28.150 --> 05:12:28.160 align:start position:0%
the part the schools just go above and
 
05:12:30.868 --> 05:12:30.878 align:start position:0%
beyond based on the desires of their
 
05:12:33.670 --> 05:12:33.680 align:start position:0%
local cons so so so going through the
 
05:12:35.990 --> 05:12:36.000 align:start position:0%
new language starting on line 13 and
 
05:12:39.990 --> 05:12:40.000 align:start position:0%
going through um through line 17 um it
 
05:12:42.190 --> 05:12:42.200 align:start position:0%
it's saying that the necessary specific
 
05:12:45.230 --> 05:12:45.240 align:start position:0%
resource elements shall include doesn't
 
05:12:47.230 --> 05:12:47.240 align:start position:0%
have to be limited to but they shall
 
05:12:50.230 --> 05:12:50.240 align:start position:0%
include these and so anything that's not
 
05:12:53.110 --> 05:12:53.120 align:start position:0%
articulated uh here in this bill um I
 
05:12:55.310 --> 05:12:55.320 align:start position:0%
don't believe the uh the state would
 
05:12:58.310 --> 05:12:58.320 align:start position:0%
have to consider those costs as part of
 
05:13:00.548 --> 05:13:00.558 align:start position:0%
um an adequate education this came
 
05:13:02.750 --> 05:13:02.760 align:start position:0%
strictly from the uh the convel court
 
05:13:06.070 --> 05:13:06.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:09.510 --> 05:13:09.520 align:start position:0%
you other questions
 
05:13:09.520 --> 05:13:11.948 align:start position:0%
you other questions
representative

05:13:11.948 --> 05:13:11.958 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:13:14.270 --> 05:13:14.280 align:start position:0%
Cen thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
05:13:16.548 --> 05:13:16.558 align:start position:0%
for taking my question how would you
 
05:13:20.150 --> 05:13:20.160 align:start position:0%
consider um that we equalize these
 
05:13:22.150 --> 05:13:22.160 align:start position:0%
numbers from District to District as
 
05:13:23.948 --> 05:13:23.958 align:start position:0%
we're looking at this from a state
 
05:13:26.708 --> 05:13:26.718 align:start position:0%
perspective uh what I mean by that is
 
05:13:28.788 --> 05:13:28.798 align:start position:0%
what let's say snow plowing and sanding
 
05:13:32.510 --> 05:13:32.520 align:start position:0%
for example if one district is paying on
 
05:13:35.350 --> 05:13:35.360 align:start position:0%
a per incident basis versus another
 
05:13:37.910 --> 05:13:37.920 align:start position:0%
District that's paying a flat rate um
 
05:13:40.190 --> 05:13:40.200 align:start position:0%
throughout the season how do we equalize
 
05:13:42.670 --> 05:13:42.680 align:start position:0%
those yeah no that's a that's a great
 
05:13:46.230 --> 05:13:46.240 align:start position:0%
question and I think that that that goes
 
05:13:47.990 --> 05:13:48.000 align:start position:0%
right to
 
05:13:51.430 --> 05:13:51.440 align:start position:0%
the right to one of the flaws I think in
 
05:13:53.628 --> 05:13:53.638 align:start position:0%
a one-size fits-all type of funding
 
05:13:56.150 --> 05:13:56.160 align:start position:0%
formula do you average them all together
 
05:13:58.190 --> 05:13:58.200 align:start position:0%
do you take the maximum do you take the
 
05:14:00.788 --> 05:14:00.798 align:start position:0%
low the low one I mean the the
 
05:14:02.948 --> 05:14:02.958 align:start position:0%
transportation costs on a per pupil
 
05:14:05.270 --> 05:14:05.280 align:start position:0%
bases are going to be higher in karge
 
05:14:08.230 --> 05:14:08.240 align:start position:0%
than they are in hopkington you know I I
 
05:14:09.470 --> 05:14:09.480 align:start position:0%
don't know how I'm not looking at the
 
05:14:11.590 --> 05:14:11.600 align:start position:0%
numbers but I couldn't imagine it being
 
05:14:13.830 --> 05:14:13.840 align:start position:0%
the uh being the other way around so do
 
05:14:17.110 --> 05:14:17.120 align:start position:0%
you go with hopkinson's um uh small
 
05:14:19.110 --> 05:14:19.120 align:start position:0%
school district single School single
 
05:14:20.990 --> 05:14:21.000 align:start position:0%
Town School District do you go with that
 
05:14:23.190 --> 05:14:23.200 align:start position:0%
for transportation cost per people or do
 
05:14:25.390 --> 05:14:25.400 align:start position:0%
you go with cure sges these are these
 
05:14:26.788 --> 05:14:26.798 align:start position:0%
are the challenges some of the
 
05:14:28.830 --> 05:14:28.840 align:start position:0%
challenges you have in a one siiz
 
05:14:32.190 --> 05:14:32.200 align:start position:0%
fits-all flat funding uh model and and
 
05:14:34.868 --> 05:14:34.878 align:start position:0%
as the chair was saying once we get into
 
05:14:36.708 --> 05:14:36.718 align:start position:0%
uh work sessions I think we'll be able
 
05:14:39.030 --> 05:14:39.040 align:start position:0%
to look at at at other funding
 
05:14:41.510 --> 05:14:41.520 align:start position:0%
approaches that I think can get right at
 
05:14:44.510 --> 05:14:44.520 align:start position:0%
um what you're what you're talking about
 
05:14:47.310 --> 05:14:47.320 align:start position:0%
your your question is
 
05:14:49.548 --> 05:14:49.558 align:start position:0%
spoton representative
 
05:14:52.390 --> 05:14:52.400 align:start position:0%
MCU thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
05:14:54.510 --> 05:14:54.520 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question so
 
05:14:57.070 --> 05:14:57.080 align:start position:0%
this bill has one of the scariest fiscal
 
05:15:01.190 --> 05:15:01.200 align:start position:0%
notes I've ever seen $450 million a year
 
05:15:07.150 --> 05:15:07.160 align:start position:0%
more I rounded it to five fine
 
05:15:09.910 --> 05:15:09.920 align:start position:0%
um but it doesn't say where that money
 
05:15:12.270 --> 05:15:12.280 align:start position:0%
comes from do you have any ideas where
 
05:15:14.628 --> 05:15:14.638 align:start position:0%
we could find that kind
 
05:15:17.190 --> 05:15:17.200 align:start position:0%
of that amount of money well you know
 
05:15:19.750 --> 05:15:19.760 align:start position:0%
it's interesting you say that because uh
 
05:15:21.670 --> 05:15:21.680 align:start position:0%
because we are I'm not I'm not saying we
 
05:15:24.670 --> 05:15:24.680 align:start position:0%
need to spend as a state not as let me
 
05:15:26.830 --> 05:15:26.840 align:start position:0%
say a different one Allin I'm not saying
 
05:15:29.150 --> 05:15:29.160 align:start position:0%
we need to spend more on our on our
 
05:15:31.190 --> 05:15:31.200 align:start position:0%
Public Schools uh I'm just saying the
 
05:15:32.628 --> 05:15:32.638 align:start position:0%
funding needs to be coming from a
 
05:15:35.910 --> 05:15:35.920 align:start position:0%
different uh um a different pot and so
 
05:15:37.750 --> 05:15:37.760 align:start position:0%
the money is already being there it's
 
05:15:40.390 --> 05:15:40.400 align:start position:0%
coming from local property taxpayers so
 
05:15:43.030 --> 05:15:43.040 align:start position:0%
we're already paying for it I'm just
 
05:15:45.548 --> 05:15:45.558 align:start position:0%
simply s or this bill is just simply
 
05:15:49.070 --> 05:15:49.080 align:start position:0%
suggesting that that and the court is
 
05:15:51.548 --> 05:15:51.558 align:start position:0%
simply suggesting that the state pick up
 
05:15:54.948 --> 05:15:54.958 align:start position:0%
a larger share of money we're already um
 
05:15:57.350 --> 05:15:57.360 align:start position:0%
we're already raising as to your as to
 
05:16:00.548 --> 05:16:00.558 align:start position:0%
the the where I can certainly think of
 
05:16:03.590 --> 05:16:03.600 align:start position:0%
of some areas but I also think that's
 
05:16:05.750 --> 05:16:05.760 align:start position:0%
that's something that um that maybe
 
05:16:07.590 --> 05:16:07.600 align:start position:0%
we'll talk about in a work group but
 
05:16:09.750 --> 05:16:09.760 align:start position:0%
it's certainly an important uh
 
05:16:12.230 --> 05:16:12.240 align:start position:0%
discussion when uh when bills like this
 
05:16:14.270 --> 05:16:14.280 align:start position:0%
or when whatever the product is from
 
05:16:18.548 --> 05:16:18.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:21.750 --> 05:16:21.760 align:start position:0%
finance yes thank you Mr chairman thank
 
05:16:24.628 --> 05:16:24.638 align:start position:0%
you for taking my followup so I'm sort
 
05:16:25.948 --> 05:16:25.958 align:start position:0%
of hearing you
 
05:16:29.548 --> 05:16:29.558 align:start position:0%
say it'll still come from property taxes
 
05:16:31.670 --> 05:16:31.680 align:start position:0%
and and what I what no no you're not
 
05:16:34.030 --> 05:16:34.040 align:start position:0%
hearing me say that we what I want to be
 
05:16:37.510 --> 05:16:37.520 align:start position:0%
really clear what um what what what I'm
 
05:16:40.070 --> 05:16:40.080 align:start position:0%
saying is that is that local property
 
05:16:43.830 --> 05:16:43.840 align:start position:0%
taxes are already being raised to pay
 
05:16:46.548 --> 05:16:46.558 align:start position:0%
this um uh this amount and that the
 
05:16:50.190 --> 05:16:50.200 align:start position:0%
state needs to look for for State
 
05:16:54.070 --> 05:16:54.080 align:start position:0%
revenues in order to um uh to do
 
05:16:56.708 --> 05:16:56.718 align:start position:0%
that I I would suggest that this is a
 
05:16:58.830 --> 05:16:58.840 align:start position:0%
perfect illustration of what I mean by
 
05:17:00.990 --> 05:17:01.000 align:start position:0%
waiting for the rest of the package of
 
05:17:02.470 --> 05:17:02.480 align:start position:0%
bills to come with us because the
 
05:17:04.788 --> 05:17:04.798 align:start position:0%
mechanism of how that comes whether it's
 
05:17:06.670 --> 05:17:06.680 align:start position:0%
incremental funding or whether it's a
 
05:17:09.150 --> 05:17:09.160 align:start position:0%
substitution funding I think that's very
 
05:17:11.270 --> 05:17:11.280 align:start position:0%
much what we're going to be
 
05:17:15.590 --> 05:17:15.600 align:start position:0%
exploring yes represent fellas thank you
 
05:17:17.510 --> 05:17:17.520 align:start position:0%
so one of the things I notice when I
 
05:17:19.510 --> 05:17:19.520 align:start position:0%
look at this is there are two sections
 
05:17:23.310 --> 05:17:23.320 align:start position:0%
to this bill and one of them is amending
 
05:17:28.670 --> 05:17:28.680 align:start position:0%
a 198 bill um 198 RSA and the other one
 
05:17:33.390 --> 05:17:33.400 align:start position:0%
is amending uh 193 so these are two very
 
05:17:36.750 --> 05:17:36.760 align:start position:0%
different parts of our
 
05:17:39.270 --> 05:17:39.280 align:start position:0%
laws one there're two two different
 
05:17:41.030 --> 05:17:41.040 align:start position:0%
parts yeah they're two I mean they're on
 
05:17:42.430 --> 05:17:42.440 align:start position:0%
the this piece of paper they're right
 
05:17:43.868 --> 05:17:43.878 align:start position:0%
beside each other but they're really in
 
05:17:47.190 --> 05:17:47.200 align:start position:0%
two very different parts so in in that
 
05:17:50.470 --> 05:17:50.480 align:start position:0%
case when I look read the second part I
 
05:17:53.750 --> 05:17:53.760 align:start position:0%
don't necessarily connect it with the
 
05:17:58.590 --> 05:17:58.600 align:start position:0%
first part so is do you agree that when
 
05:18:01.350 --> 05:18:01.360 align:start position:0%
we look at the elements that doesn't
 
05:18:03.708 --> 05:18:03.718 align:start position:0%
mean that these elements have to be
 
05:18:07.270 --> 05:18:07.280 align:start position:0%
turned into a per pupil amount that
 
05:18:10.230 --> 05:18:10.240 align:start position:0%
there could be other ways to to um look
 
05:18:12.750 --> 05:18:12.760 align:start position:0%
at the cost of these elements and put it
 
05:18:16.310 --> 05:18:16.320 align:start position:0%
in some kind of Aid formula yeah so so
 
05:18:18.190 --> 05:18:18.200 align:start position:0%
thank you for the the the question
 
05:18:21.708 --> 05:18:21.718 align:start position:0%
representative fellows the um you know
 
05:18:25.830 --> 05:18:25.840 align:start position:0%
the non-bold type under section two uh
 
05:18:28.230 --> 05:18:28.240 align:start position:0%
is existing law so the general court
 
05:18:30.548 --> 05:18:30.558 align:start position:0%
shall use the determin the definition of
 
05:18:31.990 --> 05:18:32.000 align:start position:0%
the opportunity for an adequate
 
05:18:35.150 --> 05:18:35.160 align:start position:0%
education in 193 e2a and so that's the
 
05:18:39.708 --> 05:18:39.718 align:start position:0%
laundry list of items of um of um of uh
 
05:18:42.390 --> 05:18:42.400 align:start position:0%
the the the required program elements
 
05:18:44.628 --> 05:18:44.638 align:start position:0%
that every school must offer not that
 
05:18:47.150 --> 05:18:47.160 align:start position:0%
every student must take but that every
 
05:18:49.670 --> 05:18:49.680 align:start position:0%
every school must offer in its um in its
 
05:18:53.350 --> 05:18:53.360 align:start position:0%
program of studies and um and the
 
05:18:58.270 --> 05:18:58.280 align:start position:0%
specific section here in Roman 1 um uh
 
05:19:02.750 --> 05:19:02.760 align:start position:0%
of3 e2b Roman 1 talks about how you go
 
05:19:05.548 --> 05:19:05.558 align:start position:0%
about costing out those elements and
 
05:19:09.110 --> 05:19:09.120 align:start position:0%
it's not just it you know it's not not
 
05:19:12.110 --> 05:19:12.120 align:start position:0%
just teaching of history or teaching of
 
05:19:14.310 --> 05:19:14.320 align:start position:0%
math or teaching of social studies or
 
05:19:18.270 --> 05:19:18.280 align:start position:0%
teaching of science um it it
 
05:19:21.470 --> 05:19:21.480 align:start position:0%
it it was clear from the from the conval
 
05:19:25.270 --> 05:19:25.280 align:start position:0%
order that that far more goes into it
 
05:19:28.030 --> 05:19:28.040 align:start position:0%
than just the delivery of instruction
 
05:19:30.990 --> 05:19:31.000 align:start position:0%
and so so you know everything from
 
05:19:32.868 --> 05:19:32.878 align:start position:0%
principles and administrative assistance
 
05:19:34.708 --> 05:19:34.718 align:start position:0%
and school C I mean I'm just reading
 
05:19:37.350 --> 05:19:37.360 align:start position:0%
from from what's in here which is uh
 
05:19:39.830 --> 05:19:39.840 align:start position:0%
which is taken directly from the uh the
 
05:19:42.390 --> 05:19:42.400 align:start position:0%
conval it's not taken as a paragraph in
 
05:19:44.708 --> 05:19:44.718 align:start position:0%
the conval order it goes through each
 
05:19:48.470 --> 05:19:48.480 align:start position:0%
each block that that discussed um these
 
05:19:51.230 --> 05:19:51.240 align:start position:0%
resource elements and how they together
 
05:19:54.788 --> 05:19:54.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:00.270 --> 05:20:00.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:02.830 --> 05:20:02.840 align:start position:0%
amount thank
 
05:20:05.788 --> 05:20:05.798 align:start position:0%
you are there further questions of
 
05:20:05.798 --> 05:20:07.070 align:start position:0%
you are there further questions of
represent

05:20:07.070 --> 05:20:07.080 align:start position:0%
represent
 
05:20:09.670 --> 05:20:09.680 align:start position:0%
luno represent LUN I have one I just
 
05:20:13.350 --> 05:20:13.360 align:start position:0%
walked in but uh uh 193
 
05:20:16.190 --> 05:20:16.200 align:start position:0%
e2a is the area we've talked about so
 
05:20:19.270 --> 05:20:19.280 align:start position:0%
many many times before and it's those
 
05:20:21.510 --> 05:20:21.520 align:start position:0%
areas where we identify the substantive
 
05:20:23.510 --> 05:20:23.520 align:start position:0%
criteria for an adequate education and
 
05:20:27.270 --> 05:20:27.280 align:start position:0%
list those 11 areas of study MH you've
 
05:20:30.990 --> 05:20:31.000 align:start position:0%
Incorporated areas here Beyond those 11
 
05:20:33.788 --> 05:20:33.798 align:start position:0%
areas are you now driving at the fact
 
05:20:35.470 --> 05:20:35.480 align:start position:0%
that you're now going to consider these
 
05:20:37.310 --> 05:20:37.320 align:start position:0%
areas components of an adequate
 
05:20:40.670 --> 05:20:40.680 align:start position:0%
education so so so thank you very much
 
05:20:44.110 --> 05:20:44.120 align:start position:0%
what I there were no this bill makes no
 
05:20:49.310 --> 05:20:49.320 align:start position:0%
changes to the um the the definition of
 
05:20:51.070 --> 05:20:51.080 align:start position:0%
the opportunity for an adequate
 
05:20:54.910 --> 05:20:54.920 align:start position:0%
education as defined in 193 e2a what
 
05:20:57.310 --> 05:20:57.320 align:start position:0%
what you just talked about Mr chair are
 
05:21:00.350 --> 05:21:00.360 align:start position:0%
the the um the substantive components of
 
05:21:03.590 --> 05:21:03.600 align:start position:0%
a of a program that offers and to offer
 
05:21:05.030 --> 05:21:05.040 align:start position:0%
the opportunity for an adequate
 
05:21:08.590 --> 05:21:08.600 align:start position:0%
education this makes no changes to those
 
05:21:11.190 --> 05:21:11.200 align:start position:0%
substantive areas but it does make a
 
05:21:13.310 --> 05:21:13.320 align:start position:0%
change in terms of how you go about
 
05:21:16.390 --> 05:21:16.400 align:start position:0%
calculating the cost to deliver the
 
05:21:19.910 --> 05:21:19.920 align:start position:0%
deliver a program that contains those
 
05:21:23.150 --> 05:21:23.160 align:start position:0%
substantive contact UM substantive
 
05:21:27.590 --> 05:21:27.600 align:start position:0%
content U areas and that that those
 
05:21:30.350 --> 05:21:30.360 align:start position:0%
costs aren't just you know what I was
 
05:21:32.948 --> 05:21:32.958 align:start position:0%
saying ear it isn't just the instruction
 
05:21:36.990 --> 05:21:37.000 align:start position:0%
of um you know of of you know science or
 
05:21:39.150 --> 05:21:39.160 align:start position:0%
math or or Ela
 
05:21:41.548 --> 05:21:41.558 align:start position:0%
but it's all the things that are
 
05:21:44.590 --> 05:21:44.600 align:start position:0%
included in providing that uh that
 
05:21:47.470 --> 05:21:47.480 align:start position:0%
instruction in a um in a in a public
 
05:21:50.270 --> 05:21:50.280 align:start position:0%
school environment and so uh library
 
05:21:51.948 --> 05:21:51.958 align:start position:0%
media specialist actually I think we
 
05:21:54.590 --> 05:21:54.600 align:start position:0%
have that in the um in the calculation
 
05:21:57.190 --> 05:21:57.200 align:start position:0%
it's not in the law anyway anywhere but
 
05:22:00.510 --> 05:22:00.520 align:start position:0%
it's in the calculation of the um of the
 
05:22:04.788 --> 05:22:04.798 align:start position:0%
U of of of how a base cost is calculated
 
05:22:06.910 --> 05:22:06.920 align:start position:0%
but uh but things like technology
 
05:22:09.350 --> 05:22:09.360 align:start position:0%
administrators custodians Nurse Services
 
05:22:12.190 --> 05:22:12.200 align:start position:0%
instruction materials um facility
 
05:22:14.430 --> 05:22:14.440 align:start position:0%
operation and maintenance those those
 
05:22:16.910 --> 05:22:16.920 align:start position:0%
have not been part of that uh that
 
05:22:18.628 --> 05:22:18.638 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet calculation again which is
 
05:22:22.590 --> 05:22:22.600 align:start position:0%
not in law so so uh so these changes are
 
05:22:25.948 --> 05:22:25.958 align:start position:0%
not not to change the content of a uh of
 
05:22:28.390 --> 05:22:28.400 align:start position:0%
the opportunity for an educate of an the
 
05:22:30.708 --> 05:22:30.718 align:start position:0%
content of the opportunity for an
 
05:22:33.310 --> 05:22:33.320 align:start position:0%
adequate education only to how you cost
 
05:22:38.750 --> 05:22:38.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:40.868 --> 05:22:40.878 align:start position:0%
I'm noticing within the litany right
 
05:22:43.510 --> 05:22:43.520 align:start position:0%
here not the litany but the list of
 
05:22:47.708 --> 05:22:47.718 align:start position:0%
inputs that one of those areas is not
 
05:22:50.310 --> 05:22:50.320 align:start position:0%
currently a result of the estherbrook
 
05:22:52.868 --> 05:22:52.878 align:start position:0%
study back in
 
05:22:56.030 --> 05:22:56.040 align:start position:0%
2008 and that is Nurses that's listed as
 
05:22:59.470 --> 05:22:59.480 align:start position:0%
an optional area elsewhere in statute
 
05:23:01.948 --> 05:23:01.958 align:start position:0%
but the other components are part of and
 
05:23:04.150 --> 05:23:04.160 align:start position:0%
are built into that initial formula I'm
 
05:23:06.990 --> 05:23:07.000 align:start position:0%
just wondering why did you then take one
 
05:23:09.390 --> 05:23:09.400 align:start position:0%
item and put it in here uh because it
 
05:23:11.070 --> 05:23:11.080 align:start position:0%
was included in the that's part of the
 
05:23:11.080 --> 05:23:12.150 align:start position:0%
was included in the that's part of the
conell

05:23:12.150 --> 05:23:12.160 align:start position:0%
conell
 
05:23:15.470 --> 05:23:15.480 align:start position:0%
order so th this is this is complete in
 
05:23:19.830 --> 05:23:19.840 align:start position:0%
terms of um uh of um synthesizing the
 
05:23:23.150 --> 05:23:23.160 align:start position:0%
conell order into our current um one
 
05:23:26.390 --> 05:23:26.400 align:start position:0%
siiz fits-all um education funding model
 
05:23:28.510 --> 05:23:28.520 align:start position:0%
thank you further questions from repon
 
05:23:30.868 --> 05:23:30.878 align:start position:0%
Luna or
 
05:23:32.910 --> 05:23:32.920 align:start position:0%
for thank you very much I'll take
 
05:23:35.430 --> 05:23:35.440 align:start position:0%
questions anytime so back here all right
 
05:23:37.190 --> 05:23:37.200 align:start position:0%
I'm sure thank you very much Mr CH thank
 
05:23:49.910 --> 05:23:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:51.948 --> 05:23:51.958 align:start position:0%
thank you honorable Mr chair and
 
05:23:53.948 --> 05:23:53.958 align:start position:0%
committee members uh my name is
 
05:23:55.788 --> 05:23:55.798 align:start position:0%
representative Heath Howard I represent
 
05:23:57.510 --> 05:23:57.520 align:start position:0%
the towns of straford and barington in
 
05:24:00.590 --> 05:24:00.600 align:start position:0%
straford District 4 over the past 30
 
05:24:01.990 --> 05:24:02.000 align:start position:0%
years the state of New Hampshire has
 
05:24:03.510 --> 05:24:03.520 align:start position:0%
failed to meet its constitutional
 
05:24:05.470 --> 05:24:05.480 align:start position:0%
obligations by funding each student's
 
05:24:07.990 --> 05:24:08.000 align:start position:0%
education to an adequate level we just
 
05:24:09.470 --> 05:24:09.480 align:start position:0%
had another ruling handed down in the
 
05:24:11.788 --> 05:24:11.798 align:start position:0%
conal case as representative luno had
 
05:24:15.110 --> 05:24:15.120 align:start position:0%
stated uh that states that schools need
 
05:24:17.948 --> 05:24:17.958 align:start position:0%
a conservative $110,000 per student
 
05:24:20.868 --> 05:24:20.878 align:start position:0%
minimum last year the house passed HB
 
05:24:23.788 --> 05:24:23.798 align:start position:0%
1583 but the Senate moved to send that
 
05:24:27.510 --> 05:24:27.520 align:start position:0%
legislation interim study HB 550 is even
 
05:24:28.910 --> 05:24:28.920 align:start position:0%
more conservative than what was
 
05:24:30.628 --> 05:24:30.638 align:start position:0%
introduced with HB
 
05:24:33.670 --> 05:24:33.680 align:start position:0%
1583 and is still less than what was
 
05:24:36.430 --> 05:24:36.440 align:start position:0%
suggested we should be funding education
 
05:24:39.350 --> 05:24:39.360 align:start position:0%
uh adequacy to in the convo case
 
05:24:41.350 --> 05:24:41.360 align:start position:0%
I understand we are seeing serious
 
05:24:43.350 --> 05:24:43.360 align:start position:0%
budgetary constraints and revenues are
 
05:24:45.270 --> 05:24:45.280 align:start position:0%
significantly down but we have
 
05:24:48.230 --> 05:24:48.240 align:start position:0%
situations like in my town of straford
 
05:24:50.628 --> 05:24:50.638 align:start position:0%
where half of the teachers are lacking
 
05:24:52.190 --> 05:24:52.200 align:start position:0%
accreditation I've asked the
 
05:24:54.708 --> 05:24:54.718 align:start position:0%
administration why and they've said it's
 
05:24:57.190 --> 05:24:57.200 align:start position:0%
difficult to recruit teachers at the pay
 
05:24:57.200 --> 05:24:58.470 align:start position:0%
difficult to recruit teachers at the pay
they

05:24:58.470 --> 05:24:58.480 align:start position:0%
they
 
05:25:01.150 --> 05:25:01.160 align:start position:0%
offer we are offering starting teachers
 
05:25:03.830 --> 05:25:03.840 align:start position:0%
people with four-year degrees about
 
05:25:06.390 --> 05:25:06.400 align:start position:0%
$40,000 less than what they could get
 
05:25:08.990 --> 05:25:09.000 align:start position:0%
working any other average job that
 
05:25:11.948 --> 05:25:11.958 align:start position:0%
requires the same education level it
 
05:25:14.190 --> 05:25:14.200 align:start position:0%
doesn't make economic sense for people
 
05:25:19.868 --> 05:25:19.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:23.750 --> 05:25:23.760 align:start position:0%
shows both of my towns uh both the towns
 
05:25:25.230 --> 05:25:25.240 align:start position:0%
in my district have become poaching
 
05:25:28.030 --> 05:25:28.040 align:start position:0%
grounds for other schools looking to get
 
05:25:30.470 --> 05:25:30.480 align:start position:0%
teachers at a discount and unfortunately
 
05:25:32.350 --> 05:25:32.360 align:start position:0%
my school knows the end result of what
 
05:25:34.190 --> 05:25:34.200 align:start position:0%
happens when you defund a school a
 
05:25:36.990 --> 05:25:37.000 align:start position:0%
little over 10 years ago straford school
 
05:25:38.628 --> 05:25:38.638 align:start position:0%
was the number one k through school in
 
05:25:42.510 --> 05:25:42.520 align:start position:0%
the state now it's in the bottom 25%
 
05:25:44.868 --> 05:25:44.878 align:start position:0%
knocking on doors in my town I know a
 
05:25:46.868 --> 05:25:46.878 align:start position:0%
lot of people who moved to straford
 
05:25:48.788 --> 05:25:48.798 align:start position:0%
because of the education
 
05:25:51.948 --> 05:25:51.958 align:start position:0%
system and there are a lot of them that
 
05:25:54.270 --> 05:25:54.280 align:start position:0%
are very very upset schools like
 
05:25:56.350 --> 05:25:56.360 align:start position:0%
straford will continue to be inefficient
 
05:25:58.628 --> 05:25:58.638 align:start position:0%
and underperform if they are underfunded
 
05:26:01.030 --> 05:26:01.040 align:start position:0%
and understaffed teachers will continue
 
05:26:02.830 --> 05:26:02.840 align:start position:0%
to look elsewhere for better pay so that
 
05:26:04.150 --> 05:26:04.160 align:start position:0%
they can put food on their family's
 
05:26:06.430 --> 05:26:06.440 align:start position:0%
table and educational outcomes will
 
05:26:08.910 --> 05:26:08.920 align:start position:0%
continue to decline un less start doing
 
05:26:11.150 --> 05:26:11.160 align:start position:0%
more like passing
 
05:26:13.230 --> 05:26:13.240 align:start position:0%
hp550 thank you so much for your time
 
05:26:17.868 --> 05:26:17.878 align:start position:0%

answering questions you mentioned that
 
05:26:33.150 --> 05:26:33.160 align:start position:0%
um the pay offered in stat for is about
 
05:26:35.350 --> 05:26:35.360 align:start position:0%
40K less than what other jobs requiring
 
05:26:37.830 --> 05:26:37.840 align:start position:0%
a similar degrees as somebody who's
 
05:26:40.390 --> 05:26:40.400 align:start position:0%
negoti Union contracts teachers union
 
05:26:42.590 --> 05:26:42.600 align:start position:0%
contracts before I I would like to
 
05:26:44.868 --> 05:26:44.878 align:start position:0%
understand is that number based on the
 
05:26:47.670 --> 05:26:47.680 align:start position:0%
anti- level wages on the average pay for
 
05:26:49.910 --> 05:26:49.920 align:start position:0%
the teachers in the district is it pay
 
05:26:52.270 --> 05:26:52.280 align:start position:0%

numbers was used that's entry thank you

I'm the superintendent of the Newport

School
 
05:27:28.990 --> 05:27:29.000 align:start position:0%
District education is the foundation of
 
05:27:31.788 --> 05:27:31.798 align:start position:0%
opportunity yet today our ability to
 
05:27:33.948 --> 05:27:33.958 align:start position:0%
provide an adequate education is being
 
05:27:36.948 --> 05:27:36.958 align:start position:0%
severely challenged as a superintendent
 
05:27:40.070 --> 05:27:40.080 align:start position:0%
responsible for 700 151 students I
 
05:27:42.190 --> 05:27:42.200 align:start position:0%
firsthand see the struggles our district
 
05:27:44.948 --> 05:27:44.958 align:start position:0%
faces due to Staffing shortages and
 
05:27:47.708 --> 05:27:47.718 align:start position:0%
increased student needs we are currently
 
05:27:50.470 --> 05:27:50.480 align:start position:0%
down 14 teaching staff that's just
 
05:27:52.310 --> 05:27:52.320 align:start position:0%
teachers that does not include our par
 
05:27:55.510 --> 05:27:55.520 align:start position:0%
Educators or any other Staffing in our
 
05:27:59.430 --> 05:27:59.440 align:start position:0%
building out of and 27 of our 83
 
05:28:03.030 --> 05:28:03.040 align:start position:0%
teachers are on an alternative plan this
 
05:28:05.390 --> 05:28:05.400 align:start position:0%
means that a significant portion of our
 
05:28:07.948 --> 05:28:07.958 align:start position:0%
educators are not fully certified and
 
05:28:10.510 --> 05:28:10.520 align:start position:0%
they their assigned roles that may
 
05:28:12.750 --> 05:28:12.760 align:start position:0%
impact the quality and the consistency
 
05:28:12.760 --> 05:28:14.030 align:start position:0%
impact the quality and the consistency
of

05:28:14.030 --> 05:28:14.040 align:start position:0%
of
 
05:28:16.750 --> 05:28:16.760 align:start position:0%
instruction Beyond Staffing nearly half
 
05:28:20.830 --> 05:28:20.840 align:start position:0%
of our student body 327 students require
 
05:28:25.190 --> 05:28:25.200 align:start position:0%
an individual education plan with uh
 
05:28:31.350 --> 05:28:31.360 align:start position:0%
with 29% on an IEP and 15% on a 504 plan
 
05:28:32.830 --> 05:28:32.840 align:start position:0%
these students deserve special
 
05:28:35.110 --> 05:28:35.120 align:start position:0%
instructions additional resources and
 
05:28:37.110 --> 05:28:37.120 align:start position:0%
trained professionals to meet their
 
05:28:38.830 --> 05:28:38.840 align:start position:0%
learning needs
 
05:28:40.910 --> 05:28:40.920 align:start position:0%
additionally we have 16 students
 
05:28:43.390 --> 05:28:43.400 align:start position:0%
learning English as a second language
 
05:28:46.510 --> 05:28:46.520 align:start position:0%
each requiring tailored support to
 
05:28:49.110 --> 05:28:49.120 align:start position:0%
succeed these numbers underscore the
 
05:28:51.708 --> 05:28:51.718 align:start position:0%
growing complexity of our classroom and
 
05:28:54.350 --> 05:28:54.360 align:start position:0%
the increasing demands placed on our
 
05:28:55.788 --> 05:28:55.798 align:start position:0%
already strained
 
05:28:58.548 --> 05:28:58.558 align:start position:0%
Educators an adequate education which
 
05:29:01.070 --> 05:29:01.080 align:start position:0%
includes school funding is not just a
 
05:29:03.868 --> 05:29:03.878 align:start position:0%
goal it's a necessity without enough
 
05:29:06.910 --> 05:29:06.920 align:start position:0%
funding qualified teachers our students
 
05:29:08.670 --> 05:29:08.680 align:start position:0%
do not receive the attention and the
 
05:29:11.628 --> 05:29:11.638 align:start position:0%
instruction they deserve the long-term
 
05:29:14.670 --> 05:29:14.680 align:start position:0%
consequences of an inadequate education
 
05:29:17.830 --> 05:29:17.840 align:start position:0%
are severe impacting graduation rates
 
05:29:20.750 --> 05:29:20.760 align:start position:0%
future employment opportunities and the
 
05:29:23.868 --> 05:29:23.878 align:start position:0%
economical strengths of our community I
 
05:29:26.830 --> 05:29:26.840 align:start position:0%
normally do not beg but I'm here today
 
05:29:28.948 --> 05:29:28.958 align:start position:0%
to beg you to do the right thing for our
 
05:29:31.590 --> 05:29:31.600 align:start position:0%
children they are not just numbers on a
 
05:29:34.390 --> 05:29:34.400 align:start position:0%
report or figures in a budget they are
 
05:29:36.310 --> 05:29:36.320 align:start position:0%
the future of our community and they
 
05:29:39.470 --> 05:29:39.480 align:start position:0%
deserve better we we must prioritize
 
05:29:41.510 --> 05:29:41.520 align:start position:0%
investment in education by recruiting
 
05:29:44.788 --> 05:29:44.798 align:start position:0%
and retaining qualified Educators
 
05:29:46.868 --> 05:29:46.878 align:start position:0%
providing the necessary resources and
 
05:29:49.628 --> 05:29:49.638 align:start position:0%
support our diverse learning needs and
 
05:29:51.910 --> 05:29:51.920 align:start position:0%
ensuring that every student regardless
 
05:29:54.470 --> 05:29:54.480 align:start position:0%
of their ability background or language
 
05:29:57.628 --> 05:29:57.638 align:start position:0%
has access to a quality education our
 
05:29:59.390 --> 05:29:59.400 align:start position:0%
students are our future and without
 
05:30:02.310 --> 05:30:02.320 align:start position:0%
immediate action we risk failing them at
 
05:30:04.948 --> 05:30:04.958 align:start position:0%
a crucial time in their development I
 
05:30:07.430 --> 05:30:07.440 align:start position:0%
urge you as decision makers to recognize
 
05:30:10.110 --> 05:30:10.120 align:start position:0%
that educ ation is not an expense it's
 
05:30:12.670 --> 05:30:12.680 align:start position:0%
an investment when we fail to provide an
 
05:30:15.708 --> 05:30:15.718 align:start position:0%
adequate education we fail our students
 
05:30:17.670 --> 05:30:17.680 align:start position:0%
our families and the future of our
 
05:30:20.670 --> 05:30:20.680 align:start position:0%
society it's time to act I ask you to
 
05:30:22.590 --> 05:30:22.600 align:start position:0%
please support House Bill 550 which
 
05:30:25.310 --> 05:30:25.320 align:start position:0%
seeks to raise the state space adequacy
 
05:30:27.548 --> 05:30:27.558 align:start position:0%
fund thank you so
 
05:30:30.070 --> 05:30:30.080 align:start position:0%
much thank you very much questions
 
05:30:32.548 --> 05:30:32.558 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire thank you Mr
 
05:30:34.230 --> 05:30:34.240 align:start position:0%
chairman and you may rule me out of
 
05:30:36.430 --> 05:30:36.440 align:start position:0%
order because it's not exactly on topic
 
05:30:38.670 --> 05:30:38.680 align:start position:0%
but you mentioned a I'm new and you
 
05:30:42.270 --> 05:30:42.280 align:start position:0%
mentioned a 504 plan what is that so a
 
05:30:45.390 --> 05:30:45.400 align:start position:0%
five so an IEP which is an individual
 
05:30:47.590 --> 05:30:47.600 align:start position:0%
okay education plan that is for special
 
05:30:50.548 --> 05:30:50.558 align:start position:0%
ed so students have to have um need have
 
05:30:53.390 --> 05:30:53.400 align:start position:0%
special education needs a 504 would be
 
05:30:55.430 --> 05:30:55.440 align:start position:0%
something that qualifies them for
 
05:30:57.230 --> 05:30:57.240 align:start position:0%
something that's not necessarily A
 
05:30:59.910 --> 05:30:59.920 align:start position:0%
specialized plan so it could it could be
 
05:31:02.548 --> 05:31:02.558 align:start position:0%
a student that may has may have ADHD
 
05:31:05.070 --> 05:31:05.080 align:start position:0%
that cannot sit in one place at one time
 
05:31:06.830 --> 05:31:06.840 align:start position:0%
they may need to go to another room to
 
05:31:08.708 --> 05:31:08.718 align:start position:0%
do testing so it's things such as that
 
05:31:12.030 --> 05:31:12.040 align:start position:0%
so it is um an alternative type of
 
05:31:14.350 --> 05:31:14.360 align:start position:0%
learning let me explain for you a little
 
05:31:16.590 --> 05:31:16.600 align:start position:0%
bit more um when I was a school
 
05:31:19.070 --> 05:31:19.080 align:start position:0%
principal in another state we had a
 
05:31:22.868 --> 05:31:22.878 align:start position:0%
student that was in a car accident and
 
05:31:26.350 --> 05:31:26.360 align:start position:0%
broke both legs and was immobile for
 
05:31:30.430 --> 05:31:30.440 align:start position:0%
over well over 3 to four months and the
 
05:31:34.310 --> 05:31:34.320 align:start position:0%
504 was able to take care of
 
05:31:37.270 --> 05:31:37.280 align:start position:0%
the education which was brought to that
 
05:31:40.990 --> 05:31:41.000 align:start position:0%
child at home the child was immobile in
 
05:31:44.628 --> 05:31:44.638 align:start position:0%
bed and so the parent or teacher
 
05:31:46.948 --> 05:31:46.958 align:start position:0%
depending upon the needs of the IEP also
 
05:31:49.628 --> 05:31:49.638 align:start position:0%
a special ed of the IEP were brought
 
05:31:52.948 --> 05:31:52.958 align:start position:0%
there so it was a double dip and it
 
05:31:54.190 --> 05:31:54.200 align:start position:0%
could have been without the IP they
 
05:31:55.670 --> 05:31:55.680 align:start position:0%
would have gotten the 504 service
 
05:31:59.190 --> 05:31:59.200 align:start position:0%
anyways because that's federal
 
05:32:02.310 --> 05:32:02.320 align:start position:0%
law represent papovich question thank
 
05:32:05.270 --> 05:32:05.280 align:start position:0%
you yes um two very short questions if I
 
05:32:06.948 --> 05:32:06.958 align:start position:0%
may one of them is in regards to your
 
05:32:10.030 --> 05:32:10.040 align:start position:0%
ESL student you mentioned them and I'm
 
05:32:11.548 --> 05:32:11.558 align:start position:0%
you know obviously they you do need to
 
05:32:14.590 --> 05:32:14.600 align:start position:0%
incur additional expenses can I ask on
 
05:32:16.910 --> 05:32:16.920 align:start position:0%
average if you have how long does it
 
05:32:18.830 --> 05:32:18.840 align:start position:0%
take from the moment they enter as ESL
 
05:32:20.990 --> 05:32:21.000 align:start position:0%
students till they stop requiring
 
05:32:24.510 --> 05:32:24.520 align:start position:0%
services for ESL ballpark I know every
 
05:32:26.510 --> 05:32:26.520 align:start position:0%
kid is different but yeah so that's what
 
05:32:28.150 --> 05:32:28.160 align:start position:0%
I was going to say it depends upon when
 
05:32:30.110 --> 05:32:30.120 align:start position:0%
they come in right so if a student is an
 
05:32:33.350 --> 05:32:33.360 align:start position:0%
ESL ESL student and they come in in the
 
05:32:35.510 --> 05:32:35.520 align:start position:0%
Elementary grades the younger grades
 
05:32:40.030 --> 05:32:40.040 align:start position:0%
it's easier to um to to help assist them
 
05:32:42.510 --> 05:32:42.520 align:start position:0%
with their educational needs if they're
 
05:32:44.070 --> 05:32:44.080 align:start position:0%
in the middle school or high school it
 
05:32:45.830 --> 05:32:45.840 align:start position:0%
becomes longterm so I would say an
 
05:32:47.708 --> 05:32:47.718 align:start position:0%
elementary student could be anywhere
 
05:32:51.150 --> 05:32:51.160 align:start position:0%
from 2 to four years whereas a middle
 
05:32:53.510 --> 05:32:53.520 align:start position:0%
school or a high school student could be
 
05:32:55.670 --> 05:32:55.680 align:start position:0%
longer and just to give you an example
 
05:32:58.030 --> 05:32:58.040 align:start position:0%
last year we had
 
05:33:01.788 --> 05:33:01.798 align:start position:0%
five yeah and a quick second
 
05:33:04.230 --> 05:33:04.240 align:start position:0%
question separate question but I had
 
05:33:07.150 --> 05:33:07.160 align:start position:0%
both when you say we should do the right
 
05:33:08.548 --> 05:33:08.558 align:start position:0%
thing for our students one of the
 
05:33:10.350 --> 05:33:10.360 align:start position:0%
earlier speakers was saying they're not
 
05:33:11.910 --> 05:33:11.920 align:start position:0%
necessarily looking for additional
 
05:33:13.990 --> 05:33:14.000 align:start position:0%
funding they're just looking to change
 
05:33:17.030 --> 05:33:17.040 align:start position:0%
the mechanisms used what would be in
 
05:33:18.788 --> 05:33:18.798 align:start position:0%
your opinion the right thing for our
 
05:33:20.430 --> 05:33:20.440 align:start position:0%
students in terms of the level of
 
05:33:23.350 --> 05:33:23.360 align:start position:0%
funding that you are receiving overall
 
05:33:25.270 --> 05:33:25.280 align:start position:0%
total funding are you talking the total
 
05:33:27.910 --> 05:33:27.920 align:start position:0%
amount correct total funding for your
 
05:33:30.750 --> 05:33:30.760 align:start position:0%
school district so so personally I would
 
05:33:33.910 --> 05:33:33.920 align:start position:0%
like to see the $10,000 per student but
 
05:33:35.470 --> 05:33:35.480 align:start position:0%
I would not want that funding to come
 
05:33:37.788 --> 05:33:37.798 align:start position:0%
from the taxpayers because it's already
 
05:33:40.430 --> 05:33:40.440 align:start position:0%
causing a huge burden on our families in
 
05:33:43.390 --> 05:33:43.400 align:start position:0%
Newport cuz our taxes are already high
 
05:33:44.948 --> 05:33:44.958 align:start position:0%
and so an example would be this year
 
05:33:47.030 --> 05:33:47.040 align:start position:0%
we're in budget season my budget
 
05:33:49.990 --> 05:33:50.000 align:start position:0%
basically was Hardy denied um and we
 
05:33:51.948 --> 05:33:51.958 align:start position:0%
were asked to level fund it because we
 
05:33:53.910 --> 05:33:53.920 align:start position:0%
just they could not afford any more on
 
05:33:56.270 --> 05:33:56.280 align:start position:0%
their tax rate So currently I'm going
 
05:33:59.990 --> 05:34:00.000 align:start position:0%
into my budget with minus a penny for
 
05:34:02.788 --> 05:34:02.798 align:start position:0%
both my default and my budget because
 
05:34:05.948 --> 05:34:05.958 align:start position:0%
the the ability to pay is not there for
 
05:34:07.830 --> 05:34:07.840 align:start position:0%
our Newport families just to make sure
 
05:34:09.590 --> 05:34:09.600 align:start position:0%
understood you correctly you would like
 
05:34:11.470 --> 05:34:11.480 align:start position:0%
to see some additional funding but
 
05:34:13.310 --> 05:34:13.320 align:start position:0%
ideally not from the local property
 
05:34:14.868 --> 05:34:14.878 align:start position:0%
taxes I just want to make sure I
 
05:34:16.750 --> 05:34:16.760 align:start position:0%
understood you that is absolutely
 
05:34:19.150 --> 05:34:19.160 align:start position:0%
correct just to give you an example too
 
05:34:21.150 --> 05:34:21.160 align:start position:0%
that a lot of my teachers actually
 
05:34:23.910 --> 05:34:23.920 align:start position:0%
qualify for low-income
 
05:34:26.470 --> 05:34:26.480 align:start position:0%
housing okay representa
 
05:34:29.310 --> 05:34:29.320 align:start position:0%
Damon thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
05:34:30.910 --> 05:34:30.920 align:start position:0%
being here superintendent nice to see my
 
05:34:30.920 --> 05:34:32.430 align:start position:0%
being here superintendent nice to see my
neighboring

05:34:32.430 --> 05:34:32.440 align:start position:0%
neighboring
 
05:34:35.110 --> 05:34:35.120 align:start position:0%
town you partially answered my question
 
05:34:38.628 --> 05:34:38.638 align:start position:0%
with your last statement in regards to
 
05:34:40.788 --> 05:34:40.798 align:start position:0%
some or many of your staff qualifying
 
05:34:45.470 --> 05:34:45.480 align:start position:0%
for low-income housing which we barely
 
05:34:48.510 --> 05:34:48.520 align:start position:0%
have could you give us some comparison
 
05:34:51.230 --> 05:34:51.240 align:start position:0%
and and round numbers is fine of what
 
05:34:54.230 --> 05:34:54.240 align:start position:0%
Newport is able to pay their staff
 
05:34:56.708 --> 05:34:56.718 align:start position:0%
compared to school districts within say
 
05:34:59.110 --> 05:34:59.120 align:start position:0%
a 20 mile radius that you compete
 
05:35:02.548 --> 05:35:02.558 align:start position:0%
with absolutely So currently Newport
 
05:35:05.708 --> 05:35:05.718 align:start position:0%
starting salary is roughly $34,000 a
 
05:35:08.190 --> 05:35:08.200 align:start position:0%
year um and that is for teacher coming
 
05:35:10.070 --> 05:35:10.080 align:start position:0%
out of college first year with a with a
 
05:35:13.830 --> 05:35:13.840 align:start position:0%
bachelor's degree um I've had this year
 
05:35:15.750 --> 05:35:15.760 align:start position:0%
about seven or eight teachers turned
 
05:35:18.868 --> 05:35:18.878 align:start position:0%
down that position because they could go
 
05:35:21.948 --> 05:35:21.958 align:start position:0%
to our neighboring town and make $88,000
 
05:35:24.750 --> 05:35:24.760 align:start position:0%
more which is about 5 minutes and that's
 
05:35:27.430 --> 05:35:27.440 align:start position:0%
just right down the street um our other
 
05:35:31.230 --> 05:35:31.240 align:start position:0%
neighboring town is almost $10,000 more
 
05:35:33.470 --> 05:35:33.480 align:start position:0%
so it's and if you go out further right
 
05:35:36.230 --> 05:35:36.240 align:start position:0%
it goes higher so yeah so we are we're
 
05:35:37.628 --> 05:35:37.638 align:start position:0%
facing that struggle that's why we're
 
05:35:40.830 --> 05:35:40.840 align:start position:0%
we're I mean here we are in you know
 
05:35:42.390 --> 05:35:42.400 align:start position:0%
going towards the end of the school year
 
05:35:45.190 --> 05:35:45.200 align:start position:0%
and we're still down 14 teachers right
 
05:35:48.750 --> 05:35:48.760 align:start position:0%
that's really impacting our our
 
05:35:51.390 --> 05:35:51.400 align:start position:0%
level followup
 
05:35:53.868 --> 05:35:53.878 align:start position:0%
yes in related to that could you just
 
05:35:55.670 --> 05:35:55.680 align:start position:0%
share what the turnover rate for your
 
05:35:58.350 --> 05:35:58.360 align:start position:0%
teaching staff is in a given
 
05:35:58.360 --> 05:36:01.270 align:start position:0%
teaching staff is in a given
representative

05:36:01.270 --> 05:36:01.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:05.910 --> 05:36:05.920 align:start position:0%
Year yes so as um earlier uh it was
 
05:36:07.948 --> 05:36:07.958 align:start position:0%
mentioned Newport is considered a
 
05:36:10.628 --> 05:36:10.638 align:start position:0%
training ground so when we have we
 
05:36:14.230 --> 05:36:14.240 align:start position:0%
approximately have between 45 to 50% of
 
05:36:17.708 --> 05:36:17.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:20.350 --> 05:36:20.360 align:start position:0%
year could you repeat sorry could you
 
05:36:23.548 --> 05:36:23.558 align:start position:0%
just repeat the number about 40 45 to
 
05:36:26.510 --> 05:36:26.520 align:start position:0%
50% of our staff so an example would be
 
05:36:30.230 --> 05:36:30.240 align:start position:0%
I probably have about currently although
 
05:36:33.150 --> 05:36:33.160 align:start position:0%
I have 14 teaching positions I probably
 
05:36:35.470 --> 05:36:35.480 align:start position:0%
have about 35
 
05:36:37.590 --> 05:36:37.600 align:start position:0%
positions throughout my district
 
05:36:37.600 --> 05:36:38.670 align:start position:0%
positions throughout my district
represent

05:36:38.670 --> 05:36:38.680 align:start position:0%
represent
 
05:36:42.350 --> 05:36:42.360 align:start position:0%
M thank you Mr chairman it um thank you
 
05:36:45.830 --> 05:36:45.840 align:start position:0%
for working in an often thankless job
 
05:36:49.310 --> 05:36:49.320 align:start position:0%
can you give me an idea of the cost the
 
05:36:51.590 --> 05:36:51.600 align:start position:0%
average cost per student right now
 
05:36:53.150 --> 05:36:53.160 align:start position:0%
currently in your District how much you
 
05:36:55.548 --> 05:36:55.558 align:start position:0%
spend from the taxpayers money and then
 
05:36:58.230 --> 05:36:58.240 align:start position:0%
can you average in the total cost
 
05:37:00.590 --> 05:37:00.600 align:start position:0%
special that included all the special
 
05:37:03.150 --> 05:37:03.160 align:start position:0%
high cost prices that you have to pay
 
05:37:05.190 --> 05:37:05.200 align:start position:0%
just the both together well what I can
 
05:37:07.150 --> 05:37:07.160 align:start position:0%
tell you is that um I just recently did
 
05:37:09.030 --> 05:37:09.040 align:start position:0%
a present presentation for our for our
 
05:37:13.590 --> 05:37:13.600 align:start position:0%
school district and um last year it was
 
05:37:16.190 --> 05:37:16.200 align:start position:0%
$27,000 to educate a student in our
 
05:37:20.310 --> 05:37:20.320 align:start position:0%
district roughly we get 4,200 from the
 
05:37:23.708 --> 05:37:23.718 align:start position:0%
state and then um we do get more for we
 
05:37:26.628 --> 05:37:26.638 align:start position:0%
do get some for Education reimbursement
 
05:37:30.670 --> 05:37:30.680 align:start position:0%
but we get about 4,200 from the
 
05:37:33.990 --> 05:37:34.000 align:start position:0%
state representative spillsbury
 
05:37:37.590 --> 05:37:37.600 align:start position:0%
yes thank you you and I have had a
 
05:37:39.548 --> 05:37:39.558 align:start position:0%
number of conversations on this subject
 
05:37:41.590 --> 05:37:41.600 align:start position:0%
so I'm very familiar with the
 
05:37:43.510 --> 05:37:43.520 align:start position:0%
unfortunate statistics regarding
 
05:37:43.520 --> 05:37:44.868 align:start position:0%
unfortunate statistics regarding
vacancies

05:37:44.868 --> 05:37:44.878 align:start position:0%
vacancies
 
05:37:48.990 --> 05:37:49.000 align:start position:0%
turnover um and uh the alternative uh
 
05:37:51.750 --> 05:37:51.760 align:start position:0%
Arrangements but leaving aside the
 
05:37:53.990 --> 05:37:54.000 align:start position:0%
question of where the money is going to
 
05:37:54.000 --> 05:37:54.788 align:start position:0%
question of where the money is going to
come

05:37:54.788 --> 05:37:54.798 align:start position:0%
come
 
05:37:58.430 --> 05:37:58.440 align:start position:0%
from what would you need to do in the
 
05:38:01.390 --> 05:38:01.400 align:start position:0%
Newport School District to stem the tide
 
05:38:03.270 --> 05:38:03.280 align:start position:0%
and stabilize the Recruitment and
 
05:38:03.280 --> 05:38:05.670 align:start position:0%
and stabilize the Recruitment and
Retention

05:38:05.670 --> 05:38:05.680 align:start position:0%
Retention
 
05:38:09.430 --> 05:38:09.440 align:start position:0%
problem so of course um it it comes down
 
05:38:13.390 --> 05:38:13.400 align:start position:0%
to salary right because we have um our
 
05:38:15.190 --> 05:38:15.200 align:start position:0%
staff like I said is and some of our
 
05:38:17.868 --> 05:38:17.878 align:start position:0%
staff is in the as receives low-income
 
05:38:19.390 --> 05:38:19.400 align:start position:0%
housing we do have some staff that are
 
05:38:21.750 --> 05:38:21.760 align:start position:0%
living in low-income housing currently
 
05:38:25.310 --> 05:38:25.320 align:start position:0%
so I think it would be stabilizing by
 
05:38:28.110 --> 05:38:28.120 align:start position:0%
being able to provide an adequate amount
 
05:38:31.070 --> 05:38:31.080 align:start position:0%
for our staff in order to keep them it
 
05:38:32.948 --> 05:38:32.958 align:start position:0%
ends up costing us more money because
 
05:38:36.510 --> 05:38:36.520 align:start position:0%
every year so could you ballpark
 
05:38:39.868 --> 05:38:39.878 align:start position:0%
quantify that of how much it would be I
 
05:38:41.830 --> 05:38:41.840 align:start position:0%
yeah so I would say our starting pay
 
05:38:43.510 --> 05:38:43.520 align:start position:0%
would probably need to need to be about
 
05:38:45.510 --> 05:38:45.520 align:start position:0%
45 to$
 
05:38:48.110 --> 05:38:48.120 align:start position:0%
46,000 and we're at
 
05:38:51.430 --> 05:38:51.440 align:start position:0%
34 now we do have you know we are asking
 
05:38:53.750 --> 05:38:53.760 align:start position:0%
our district to fund because we're in
 
05:38:56.628 --> 05:38:56.638 align:start position:0%
contracts right now but that has to pass
 
05:38:59.110 --> 05:38:59.120 align:start position:0%
through our district and the funding a
 
05:39:01.110 --> 05:39:01.120 align:start position:0%
majority of that funding has to come
 
05:39:03.190 --> 05:39:03.200 align:start position:0%
from the taxpayers right so we're
 
05:39:05.030 --> 05:39:05.040 align:start position:0%
worried and so one of the things that we
 
05:39:07.868 --> 05:39:07.878 align:start position:0%
we're worried about currently is that if
 
05:39:11.628 --> 05:39:11.638 align:start position:0%
that does not pass that um contract does
 
05:39:15.390 --> 05:39:15.400 align:start position:0%
not pass we're going to have mass
 
05:39:17.150 --> 05:39:17.160 align:start position:0%
massive teachers leaving our district
 
05:39:19.070 --> 05:39:19.080 align:start position:0%
and where does that leave Newport right
 
05:39:20.948 --> 05:39:20.958 align:start position:0%
because we're required by law to educate
 
05:39:23.510 --> 05:39:23.520 align:start position:0%
our students but what do we do we
 
05:39:26.590 --> 05:39:26.600 align:start position:0%
already have class sizes at 25 per
 
05:39:28.548 --> 05:39:28.558 align:start position:0%
student because we've had we've lost
 
05:39:30.548 --> 05:39:30.558 align:start position:0%
students now I also want you to keep in
 
05:39:32.430 --> 05:39:32.440 align:start position:0%
mind that I mean back back in the day
 
05:39:34.350 --> 05:39:34.360 align:start position:0%
when I was a classroom teacher like a
 
05:39:37.830 --> 05:39:37.840 align:start position:0%
100 years ago you know I could have 25
 
05:39:41.230 --> 05:39:41.240 align:start position:0%
or 20 students in my class but they also
 
05:39:43.150 --> 05:39:43.160 align:start position:0%
had other classrooms that were
 
05:39:45.070 --> 05:39:45.080 align:start position:0%
self-contained for students that had
 
05:39:47.350 --> 05:39:47.360 align:start position:0%
behavioral issues or other issues that
 
05:39:49.948 --> 05:39:49.958 align:start position:0%
is no longer the case all of our
 
05:39:52.708 --> 05:39:52.718 align:start position:0%
students are together right and I've
 
05:39:55.468 --> 05:39:55.478 align:start position:0%
often heard well they it's less money if
 
05:39:58.510 --> 05:39:58.520 align:start position:0%
they go to you know a a u parochial
 
05:40:01.350 --> 05:40:01.360 align:start position:0%
school or a private school but I also
 
05:40:04.030 --> 05:40:04.040 align:start position:0%
want people to keep in mind we have to
 
05:40:06.230 --> 05:40:06.240 align:start position:0%
keep our students I can't say to a
 
05:40:09.270 --> 05:40:09.280 align:start position:0%
parent I'm sorry your kids misbehaving
 
05:40:10.990 --> 05:40:11.000 align:start position:0%
today so they can no longer come to the
 
05:40:13.350 --> 05:40:13.360 align:start position:0%
Newport School District where those
 
05:40:16.830 --> 05:40:16.840 align:start position:0%
schools can so I think that is the big
 
05:40:18.150 --> 05:40:18.160 align:start position:0%
the big thing that people really need to
 
05:40:20.628 --> 05:40:20.638 align:start position:0%
look at that we're required by law to
 
05:40:24.510 --> 05:40:24.520 align:start position:0%
educate every student that lives in
 
05:40:26.708 --> 05:40:26.718 align:start position:0%
Newport further
 
05:40:28.990 --> 05:40:29.000 align:start position:0%
questions yes representative fellow I'm
 
05:40:30.110 --> 05:40:30.120 align:start position:0%
just wondering if you can tell us
 
05:40:31.468 --> 05:40:31.478 align:start position:0%
something about are your teachers
 
05:40:34.390 --> 05:40:34.400 align:start position:0%
certified in the in the subjects that
 
05:40:37.468 --> 05:40:37.478 align:start position:0%
they're teaching or CU so as I stated
 
05:40:40.750 --> 05:40:40.760 align:start position:0%
earlier I I have approximately 27 out of
 
05:40:44.750 --> 05:40:44.760 align:start position:0%
83 teachers that are are not certified
 
05:40:47.070 --> 05:40:47.080 align:start position:0%
in the areas of which they teach they
 
05:40:50.310 --> 05:40:50.320 align:start position:0%
are what they're on alternative plan so
 
05:40:51.910 --> 05:40:51.920 align:start position:0%
they have a plan in place that at the
 
05:40:54.070 --> 05:40:54.080 align:start position:0%
end of the three years they will have
 
05:40:56.310 --> 05:40:56.320 align:start position:0%
their certification but I can tell you
 
05:40:57.670 --> 05:40:57.680 align:start position:0%
exactly what's going to happen at the
 
05:40:59.510 --> 05:40:59.520 align:start position:0%
end of the three years they're going to
 
05:41:01.270 --> 05:41:01.280 align:start position:0%
leave right so we're putting all this
 
05:41:03.670 --> 05:41:03.680 align:start position:0%
money and time into getting them
 
05:41:05.750 --> 05:41:05.760 align:start position:0%
certified for them to leave to go
 
05:41:06.788 --> 05:41:06.798 align:start position:0%
someplace else where they're going to
 
05:41:09.670 --> 05:41:09.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:14.948 --> 05:41:14.958 align:start position:0%
Mone yes rent cran thank
 
05:41:18.230 --> 05:41:18.240 align:start position:0%
you um I just did you say the student to
 
05:41:21.670 --> 05:41:21.680 align:start position:0%
teacher ratio was 25 in some cases yes
 
05:41:23.948 --> 05:41:23.958 align:start position:0%
is it more can it is it more in some
 
05:41:29.190 --> 05:41:29.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:32.150 --> 05:41:32.160 align:start position:0%
you I I'd like just follow up with with
 
05:41:34.270 --> 05:41:34.280 align:start position:0%
a question see we just talked about the
 
05:41:37.430 --> 05:41:37.440 align:start position:0%
pupil teacher ratio of 25 to1 uh is that
 
05:41:39.310 --> 05:41:39.320 align:start position:0%
the year what's happening in the class
 
05:41:43.708 --> 05:41:43.718 align:start position:0%
the state funds K through 2 at 25 to1
 
05:41:47.628 --> 05:41:47.638 align:start position:0%
and three through 12 at 30 to1 that's
 
05:41:48.910 --> 05:41:48.920 align:start position:0%
the state
 
05:41:53.708 --> 05:41:53.718 align:start position:0%
share um if you put in your other staff
 
05:41:57.390 --> 05:41:57.400 align:start position:0%
members music PE Library Etc that are
 
05:42:00.270 --> 05:42:00.280 align:start position:0%
certified Personnel or working on that
 
05:42:04.110 --> 05:42:04.120 align:start position:0%
alert um what what is the that ratio
 
05:42:07.468 --> 05:42:07.478 align:start position:0%
come down to in terms of uh is it 20 5
 
05:42:10.070 --> 05:42:10.080 align:start position:0%
to1 or does it shrink down to where we
 
05:42:12.190 --> 05:42:12.200 align:start position:0%
are as an average for the state which is
 
05:42:12.200 --> 05:42:13.150 align:start position:0%
are as an average for the state which is
much

05:42:13.150 --> 05:42:13.160 align:start position:0%
much
 
05:42:16.190 --> 05:42:16.200 align:start position:0%
lower so are you talking about if I put
 
05:42:17.510 --> 05:42:17.520 align:start position:0%
them in the classroom when the teacher
 
05:42:20.110 --> 05:42:20.120 align:start position:0%
is teaching well when we when we fund we
 
05:42:23.150 --> 05:42:23.160 align:start position:0%
fund based upon the pupil teacher ratios
 
05:42:25.868 --> 05:42:25.878 align:start position:0%
based upon classroom teachers classroom
 
05:42:28.868 --> 05:42:28.878 align:start position:0%
teachers but also music teachers PE
 
05:42:28.878 --> 05:42:30.150 align:start position:0%
teachers but also music teachers PE
teachers

05:42:30.150 --> 05:42:30.160 align:start position:0%
teachers
 
05:42:33.190 --> 05:42:33.200 align:start position:0%
Librarians counselors all that so it
 
05:42:34.990 --> 05:42:35.000 align:start position:0%
would be exactly the same because what
 
05:42:37.788 --> 05:42:37.798 align:start position:0%
ends up happening is under contract our
 
05:42:39.708 --> 05:42:39.718 align:start position:0%
teachers have a time period where they
 
05:42:42.190 --> 05:42:42.200 align:start position:0%
can prep and prepare for the for the
 
05:42:44.830 --> 05:42:44.840 align:start position:0%
students right during that time their
 
05:42:48.788 --> 05:42:48.798 align:start position:0%
students are in PE library music so it
 
05:42:50.548 --> 05:42:50.558 align:start position:0%
it's the same group of students that are
 
05:42:52.910 --> 05:42:52.920 align:start position:0%
going with those teachers so it's it
 
05:42:56.910 --> 05:42:56.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:00.070 --> 05:43:00.080 align:start position:0%
one okay you know
 
05:43:03.030 --> 05:43:03.040 align:start position:0%
I let's because where I'm trying to go
 
05:43:08.948 --> 05:43:08.958 align:start position:0%
at is I'm looking at the in this bill
 
05:43:11.030 --> 05:43:11.040 align:start position:0%
$735 is what we're looking at at that
 
05:43:13.230 --> 05:43:13.240 align:start position:0%
base cost
 
05:43:15.948 --> 05:43:15.958 align:start position:0%
correct in order to get the pupil
 
05:43:18.070 --> 05:43:18.080 align:start position:0%
teacher ratio where you need to
 
05:43:20.390 --> 05:43:20.400 align:start position:0%
get we need to move some money around
 
05:43:22.670 --> 05:43:22.680 align:start position:0%
within that
 
05:43:25.510 --> 05:43:25.520 align:start position:0%
formula and to do
 
05:43:29.868 --> 05:43:29.878 align:start position:0%
that if we move it all to the leftand
 
05:43:32.430 --> 05:43:32.440 align:start position:0%
side we're going to be putting a whole
 
05:43:35.310 --> 05:43:35.320 align:start position:0%
lot more money in some of the towns
 
05:43:38.990 --> 05:43:39.000 align:start position:0%
which I'll use the word donor we have
 
05:43:40.910 --> 05:43:40.920 align:start position:0%
some towns are going to be
 
05:43:43.590 --> 05:43:43.600 align:start position:0%
receiving that much and their adequacy
 
05:43:48.670 --> 05:43:48.680 align:start position:0%
is needs are down here so how best can
 
05:43:50.468 --> 05:43:50.478 align:start position:0%
we work on this form do you have any
 
05:43:54.510 --> 05:43:54.520 align:start position:0%
ideas how to adjust the monies because
 
05:43:56.190 --> 05:43:56.200 align:start position:0%
the state's not very supportive of an
 
05:43:58.948 --> 05:43:58.958 align:start position:0%
income tax or a sales tax correct well I
 
05:44:01.468 --> 05:44:01.478 align:start position:0%
think that for me to to
 
05:44:04.070 --> 05:44:04.080 align:start position:0%
make a guess on how to do it wouldn't be
 
05:44:05.788 --> 05:44:05.798 align:start position:0%
fair because I don't know the whole
 
05:44:07.948 --> 05:44:07.958 align:start position:0%
budget process right I probably could
 
05:44:11.030 --> 05:44:11.040 align:start position:0%
say things that like an example would be
 
05:44:12.430 --> 05:44:12.440 align:start position:0%
and I know other departments would
 
05:44:14.430 --> 05:44:14.440 align:start position:0%
probably not be happy with me but if we
 
05:44:16.270 --> 05:44:16.280 align:start position:0%
don't educate our students where do they
 
05:44:20.070 --> 05:44:20.080 align:start position:0%
end up they end up in our our jails so
 
05:44:21.830 --> 05:44:21.840 align:start position:0%
maybe if we look at taking some of our
 
05:44:24.310 --> 05:44:24.320 align:start position:0%
money and putting it to our students
 
05:44:26.150 --> 05:44:26.160 align:start position:0%
when they're younger then we can
 
05:44:27.990 --> 05:44:28.000 align:start position:0%
eliminate some of the problems that we
 
05:44:30.310 --> 05:44:30.320 align:start position:0%
have when they get older right so I
 
05:44:31.910 --> 05:44:31.920 align:start position:0%
think it's a matter of looking at the
 
05:44:33.468 --> 05:44:33.478 align:start position:0%
funding and where all the funding is
 
05:44:36.150 --> 05:44:36.160 align:start position:0%
being spent and I don't have all the
 
05:44:37.868 --> 05:44:37.878 align:start position:0%
numbers in front of me so it wouldn't
 
05:44:39.590 --> 05:44:39.600 align:start position:0%
necessar it wouldn't be fair for me to
 
05:44:41.430 --> 05:44:41.440 align:start position:0%
say well take from here or take from
 
05:44:43.548 --> 05:44:43.558 align:start position:0%
here if I had you know the opportunity I
 
05:44:45.390 --> 05:44:45.400 align:start position:0%
would love to join the committee when
 
05:44:47.350 --> 05:44:47.360 align:start position:0%
they're talking about it you know and
 
05:44:49.110 --> 05:44:49.120 align:start position:0%
have some input with that having my you
 
05:44:50.670 --> 05:44:50.680 align:start position:0%

work together I will leave that up to
 
05:45:59.590 --> 05:45:59.600 align:start position:0%
the committee as they come forward but
 
05:46:03.270 --> 05:46:03.280 align:start position:0%
certainly um we are in favor of better
 
05:46:05.868 --> 05:46:05.878 align:start position:0%
State support for all of our Granite
 
05:46:09.350 --> 05:46:09.360 align:start position:0%

constitutional right that all Grand
 
05:46:15.270 --> 05:46:15.280 align:start position:0%
State children should get a robust
 
05:46:18.990 --> 05:46:19.000 align:start position:0%
public education one that um prepares
 
05:46:20.990 --> 05:46:21.000 align:start position:0%
them for Workforce career service
 
05:46:22.548 --> 05:46:22.558 align:start position:0%
further studies and po civic
 
05:46:24.990 --> 05:46:25.000 align:start position:0%
participation in their communities and
 
05:46:27.708 --> 05:46:27.718 align:start position:0%
as we've just heard described very
 
05:46:30.390 --> 05:46:30.400 align:start position:0%
ay that opportunity does not exist
 
05:46:32.750 --> 05:46:32.760 align:start position:0%
equally everywhere in our state because
 
05:46:34.910 --> 05:46:34.920 align:start position:0%
the funding from the state is extremely
 
05:46:37.510 --> 05:46:37.520 align:start position:0%
low and the ability for local property
 
05:46:39.830 --> 05:46:39.840 align:start position:0%
taxpayers to make up the difference
 
05:46:41.430 --> 05:46:41.440 align:start position:0%
varies so much from Community to
 
05:46:43.830 --> 05:46:43.840 align:start position:0%
community so in Newport they can only
 
05:46:45.830 --> 05:46:45.840 align:start position:0%
make up so much and in places like
 
05:46:50.030 --> 05:46:50.040 align:start position:0%
Newcastle they have abundance so um
 
05:46:53.430 --> 05:46:53.440 align:start position:0%
increasing base adequacy to
 
05:46:56.708 --> 05:46:56.718 align:start position:0%
73561 will go a long way to help meet
 
05:47:00.868 --> 05:47:00.878 align:start position:0%
students needs uh to have actual lower
 
05:47:04.430 --> 05:47:04.440 align:start position:0%
class sizes and give better individual
 
05:47:07.350 --> 05:47:07.360 align:start position:0%
attention um from teacher
 
05:47:09.628 --> 05:47:09.638 align:start position:0%
par Educators support staff so that
 
05:47:11.350 --> 05:47:11.360 align:start position:0%
students can have both the academic
 
05:47:13.230 --> 05:47:13.240 align:start position:0%
support and the academic challenges they
 
05:47:15.310 --> 05:47:15.320 align:start position:0%
need because there are students who need
 
05:47:16.708 --> 05:47:16.718 align:start position:0%
one students who need another and some
 
05:47:20.310 --> 05:47:20.320 align:start position:0%
students who need both
 
05:47:25.350 --> 05:47:25.360 align:start position:0%
um also changing that definition to
 
05:47:27.788 --> 05:47:27.798 align:start position:0%
increase to include more of the real
 
05:47:31.150 --> 05:47:31.160 align:start position:0%
world costs of providing education so
 
05:47:33.190 --> 05:47:33.200 align:start position:0%
that you're including all of the
 
05:47:36.270 --> 05:47:36.280 align:start position:0%
teachers and Educators the various um
 
05:47:38.910 --> 05:47:38.920 align:start position:0%
administr ative assistance the
 
05:47:41.628 --> 05:47:41.638 align:start position:0%
nursing uh staff which is very necessary
 
05:47:43.510 --> 05:47:43.520 align:start position:0%
in our schools today because there are
 
05:47:44.948 --> 05:47:44.958 align:start position:0%
so many kids who come in with medical
 
05:47:46.830 --> 05:47:46.840 align:start position:0%
needs who need them taken care of during
 
05:47:49.230 --> 05:47:49.240 align:start position:0%
the day and maintaining the school
 
05:47:51.590 --> 05:47:51.600 align:start position:0%
facility on a day like today you cannot
 
05:47:54.830 --> 05:47:54.840 align:start position:0%
argue that heat is optional or a luxury
 
05:47:57.830 --> 05:47:57.840 align:start position:0%
um and also by the way in early fall and
 
05:48:01.788 --> 05:48:01.798 align:start position:0%
late spring cooling because um it's very
 
05:48:03.230 --> 05:48:03.240 align:start position:0%
hard to get kids to pay attention and
 
05:48:06.430 --> 05:48:06.440 align:start position:0%
learn if they are melting um but those
 
05:48:08.628 --> 05:48:08.638 align:start position:0%
ca are part of an adequate education the
 
05:48:12.310 --> 05:48:12.320 align:start position:0%
state does need to pay more of a share
 
05:48:14.750 --> 05:48:14.760 align:start position:0%
so that every single student in the
 
05:48:17.670 --> 05:48:17.680 align:start position:0%
grand state has the opportunity for the
 
05:48:21.030 --> 05:48:21.040 align:start position:0%
same kind of great public education
 
05:48:23.590 --> 05:48:23.600 align:start position:0%
because we really are looking at doing
 
05:48:25.990 --> 05:48:26.000 align:start position:0%
the right thing by all of our New
 
05:48:27.910 --> 05:48:27.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire citizens so they all get the
 
05:48:30.110 --> 05:48:30.120 align:start position:0%
same great start and I will leave it
 
05:48:31.310 --> 05:48:31.320 align:start position:0%
there because there are people here who
 
05:48:33.230 --> 05:48:33.240 align:start position:0%
can speak more aily on the financial
 
05:48:36.270 --> 05:48:36.280 align:start position:0%
aspects of this um than I do and we just
 
05:48:38.270 --> 05:48:38.280 align:start position:0%
heard so wonderfully from a local
 
05:48:40.390 --> 05:48:40.400 align:start position:0%
superintendent so um I will close there
 
05:48:42.868 --> 05:48:42.878 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much Deborah
 
05:48:45.948 --> 05:48:45.958 align:start position:0%
are there questions from the
 
05:48:48.190 --> 05:48:48.200 align:start position:0%
committee not see thank you very much
 
05:48:50.110 --> 05:48:50.120 align:start position:0%
and you will have this in your email
 
05:49:00.070 --> 05:49:00.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:05.190 --> 05:49:05.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:07.670 --> 05:49:07.680 align:start position:0%
doe good afternoon mark manganello from
 
05:49:09.350 --> 05:49:09.360 align:start position:0%
the Bureau of school Finance uh
 
05:49:11.390 --> 05:49:11.400 align:start position:0%
Department of Education I'm here for
 
05:49:14.510 --> 05:49:14.520 align:start position:0%
technical assistance if you have any
 
05:49:17.230 --> 05:49:17.240 align:start position:0%
questions are there any questions that
 
05:49:19.230 --> 05:49:19.240 align:start position:0%
we have for Mark right
 
05:49:22.548 --> 05:49:22.558 align:start position:0%
now yes represent spillsbury
 
05:49:26.468 --> 05:49:26.478 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair so the bill
 
05:49:30.830 --> 05:49:30.840 align:start position:0%
includes um in lines 17 and 18 the
 
05:49:32.430 --> 05:49:32.440 align:start position:0%
general court shall update the cost of
 
05:49:35.150 --> 05:49:35.160 align:start position:0%
inadequate education at least every two
 
05:49:38.830 --> 05:49:38.840 align:start position:0%
years the fiscal note addresses the more
 
05:49:43.310 --> 05:49:43.320 align:start position:0%
or less half billion dollar cost but uh
 
05:49:46.150 --> 05:49:46.160 align:start position:0%
do you have any sense of what that might
 
05:49:49.110 --> 05:49:49.120 align:start position:0%
suggest to us going forward in say the
 
05:49:51.390 --> 05:49:51.400 align:start position:0%
next half dozen
 
05:49:53.750 --> 05:49:53.760 align:start position:0%
years no that would be indeterminable it
 
05:49:55.390 --> 05:49:55.400 align:start position:0%
would be based on the work the general
 
05:49:57.788 --> 05:49:57.798 align:start position:0%
court performs
 
05:50:01.548 --> 05:50:01.558 align:start position:0%
um uh I can't I made no predictions on
 
05:50:03.868 --> 05:50:03.878 align:start position:0%
that but that's a a good thing to point
 
05:50:08.270 --> 05:50:08.280 align:start position:0%
out indeterminable is a good answer
 
05:50:11.468 --> 05:50:11.478 align:start position:0%
representative fellows yes thank you um
 
05:50:13.708 --> 05:50:13.718 align:start position:0%
in the past six years have you modified
 
05:50:17.468 --> 05:50:17.478 align:start position:0%
the doe 2 to now have school level
 
05:50:17.478 --> 05:50:19.510 align:start position:0%
the doe 2 to now have school level
information

05:50:19.510 --> 05:50:19.520 align:start position:0%
information
 
05:50:22.070 --> 05:50:22.080 align:start position:0%
um that's uh that's correct we've added
 
05:50:24.310 --> 05:50:24.320 align:start position:0%
a school level reporting to the
 
05:50:27.468 --> 05:50:27.478 align:start position:0%
doe2 um we've been collecting it since
 
05:50:30.830 --> 05:50:30.840 align:start position:0%
2019 can just can can you follow yeah
 
05:50:33.750 --> 05:50:33.760 align:start position:0%
can you just describe what it looks like
 
05:50:37.868 --> 05:50:37.878 align:start position:0%
is it the same all the same lines that
 
05:50:39.788 --> 05:50:39.798 align:start position:0%
that we used to see for the whole
 
05:50:41.628 --> 05:50:41.638 align:start position:0%
District but at the school level or is
 
05:50:44.310 --> 05:50:44.320 align:start position:0%
it a smaller set of
 
05:50:47.590 --> 05:50:47.600 align:start position:0%
information it it's slowly been growing
 
05:50:49.788 --> 05:50:49.798 align:start position:0%
um uh the requirement to have a school
 
05:50:52.948 --> 05:50:52.958 align:start position:0%
level cost per pupil was in Essa um
 
05:50:54.868 --> 05:50:54.878 align:start position:0%
which is a federal law that has
 
05:50:57.628 --> 05:50:57.638 align:start position:0%
reporting requirements for uh uh school
 
05:51:01.510 --> 05:51:01.520 align:start position:0%
districts and so um those requirements
 
05:51:03.510 --> 05:51:03.520 align:start position:0%
um at a minimum have cost per people
 
05:51:05.150 --> 05:51:05.160 align:start position:0%
that parses out state and local funding
 
05:51:06.868 --> 05:51:06.878 align:start position:0%
in one bucket and then also Federal
 
05:51:09.190 --> 05:51:09.200 align:start position:0%
money in another bucket so that's sort
 
05:51:12.270 --> 05:51:12.280 align:start position:0%
of the Bare Bones reporting um but uh
 
05:51:13.830 --> 05:51:13.840 align:start position:0%
the US Department of Education has been
 
05:51:16.070 --> 05:51:16.080 align:start position:0%
expanding the reporting requirements at
 
05:51:18.830 --> 05:51:18.840 align:start position:0%
the school level so it's been going on
 
05:51:21.070 --> 05:51:21.080 align:start position:0%
um it's been looking more like what you
 
05:51:23.590 --> 05:51:23.600 align:start position:0%
would see on a doe2 including
 
05:51:27.948 --> 05:51:27.958 align:start position:0%
instructional um 1100 series Etc um so
 
05:51:31.910 --> 05:51:31.920 align:start position:0%
whatever the U used requires of us uh we
 
05:51:34.390 --> 05:51:34.400 align:start position:0%
build into a supplemental uh uh
 
05:51:36.628 --> 05:51:36.638 align:start position:0%
reporting requirement outside the do25 I
 
05:51:37.750 --> 05:51:37.760 align:start position:0%
representative fellow probably only
 
05:51:39.468 --> 05:51:39.478 align:start position:0%
knows this cuz she worked on this for
 
05:51:42.670 --> 05:51:42.680 align:start position:0%
for so long um and so it's slowly it's
 
05:51:44.468 --> 05:51:44.478 align:start position:0%
slowly going down the path of starting
 
05:51:47.030 --> 05:51:47.040 align:start position:0%
to look like a
 
05:51:51.548 --> 05:51:51.558 align:start position:0%
doe2 yes um Can Can we ask doe to
 
05:51:54.590 --> 05:51:54.600 align:start position:0%
provide us with some reports are that
 
05:51:57.390 --> 05:51:57.400 align:start position:0%
are along this addressing when we get
 
05:52:00.788 --> 05:52:00.798 align:start position:0%
into when we we're receiving a number of
 
05:52:04.788 --> 05:52:04.798 align:start position:0%
bills dealing with the Budget Building
 
05:52:08.270 --> 05:52:08.280 align:start position:0%
catastrophic a this we will be sending a
 
05:52:10.390 --> 05:52:10.400 align:start position:0%
report to them where we're looking for
 
05:52:12.590 --> 05:52:12.600 align:start position:0%
information so I think you need to start
 
05:52:14.390 --> 05:52:14.400 align:start position:0%
building your list I'm building a list
 
05:52:17.070 --> 05:52:17.080 align:start position:0%
also and rather than having individual
 
05:52:20.310 --> 05:52:20.320 align:start position:0%
submitt it'll come from us at one time
 
05:52:22.868 --> 05:52:22.878 align:start position:0%
we need all this information to wait
 
05:52:25.788 --> 05:52:25.798 align:start position:0%
through the tasks ahead of
 
05:52:28.350 --> 05:52:28.360 align:start position:0%
us uh Mark I have a question for you
 
05:52:31.948 --> 05:52:31.958 align:start position:0%
here line 1819 of the bill says the
 
05:52:33.868 --> 05:52:33.878 align:start position:0%
general court shall use evidence from
 
05:52:36.868 --> 05:52:36.878 align:start position:0%
actual costs
 
05:52:39.310 --> 05:52:39.320 align:start position:0%
from all approved schools to determine
 
05:52:41.830 --> 05:52:41.840 align:start position:0%
the cost of an adequate education so
 
05:52:44.670 --> 05:52:44.680 align:start position:0%
we're looking at the actual cost for an
 
05:52:44.680 --> 05:52:46.390 align:start position:0%
we're looking at the actual cost for an
adequate

05:52:46.390 --> 05:52:46.400 align:start position:0%
adequate
 
05:52:49.750 --> 05:52:49.760 align:start position:0%
education are you using the doe 24 that
 
05:52:51.670 --> 05:52:51.680 align:start position:0%
represent fellows just reference to find
 
05:52:55.270 --> 05:52:55.280 align:start position:0%
out what these actual costs are and is
 
05:52:59.990 --> 05:53:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:03.310 --> 05:53:03.320 align:start position:0%
determine components which are the
 
05:53:07.150 --> 05:53:07.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:10.548 --> 05:53:10.558 align:start position:0%
um good get to your question um uh just
 
05:53:12.310 --> 05:53:12.320 align:start position:0%
want to say all of our doe 25s are
 
05:53:15.190 --> 05:53:15.200 align:start position:0%
online um on the department's website we
 
05:53:18.230 --> 05:53:18.240 align:start position:0%
have 2019 through 2023 we'll have 2024
 
05:53:19.868 --> 05:53:19.878 align:start position:0%
on there shortly so if you ever want to
 
05:53:22.628 --> 05:53:22.638 align:start position:0%
do your own homework you can pull
 
05:53:24.830 --> 05:53:24.840 align:start position:0%
do25 uh by dist all districts and
 
05:53:28.110 --> 05:53:28.120 align:start position:0%
Charter Schools um just want to if
 
05:53:30.510 --> 05:53:30.520 align:start position:0%
anyone wants to uh read a doe2 you can
 
05:53:32.628 --> 05:53:32.638 align:start position:0%
see it on our website I think uh
 
05:53:35.708 --> 05:53:35.718 align:start position:0%
chairman lad that statement would depend
 
05:53:37.190 --> 05:53:37.200 align:start position:0%
on how the general Court wants to
 
05:53:40.190 --> 05:53:40.200 align:start position:0%
complete its task here so I knew you're
 
05:53:41.948 --> 05:53:41.958 align:start position:0%
going to say that so so some of the data
 
05:53:44.230 --> 05:53:44.240 align:start position:0%
collection tools we have the doe2 is a
 
05:53:47.670 --> 05:53:47.680 align:start position:0%
data collection tool um the d25 just um
 
05:53:48.628 --> 05:53:48.638 align:start position:0%
I think we talked about it during
 
05:53:50.830 --> 05:53:50.840 align:start position:0%
orientation it is the financial
 
05:53:52.430 --> 05:53:52.440 align:start position:0%
essentially a financial report that
 
05:53:55.230 --> 05:53:55.240 align:start position:0%
districts provide to us um as they're
 
05:53:57.430 --> 05:53:57.440 align:start position:0%
closing out their year um it's due by
 
05:53:59.430 --> 05:53:59.440 align:start position:0%
September 1st a lot of very few
 
05:54:01.230 --> 05:54:01.240 align:start position:0%
districts can achieve that September 1st
 
05:54:03.190 --> 05:54:03.200 align:start position:0%
uh Benchmark um we typically don't get
 
05:54:05.628 --> 05:54:05.638 align:start position:0%
it in and report it all out to you in in
 
05:54:07.590 --> 05:54:07.600 align:start position:0%
the form of our end of year reports
 
05:54:10.548 --> 05:54:10.558 align:start position:0%
until January um that because some
 
05:54:12.910 --> 05:54:12.920 align:start position:0%
districts take the whole fall um into
 
05:54:14.230 --> 05:54:14.240 align:start position:0%
some of the winter months to complete
 
05:54:14.240 --> 05:54:15.110 align:start position:0%
some of the winter months to complete
the

05:54:15.110 --> 05:54:15.120 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:54:18.708 --> 05:54:18.718 align:start position:0%
doe2 um so that is um uh one data
 
05:54:22.350 --> 05:54:22.360 align:start position:0%
collection Point um we can also just
 
05:54:24.788 --> 05:54:24.798 align:start position:0%
survey the schools um so to get
 
05:54:26.670 --> 05:54:26.680 align:start position:0%
information about the do25 wouldn't have
 
05:54:28.788 --> 05:54:28.798 align:start position:0%
information about teacher salaries um
 
05:54:30.788 --> 05:54:30.798 align:start position:0%
some of the information discussed here
 
05:54:33.150 --> 05:54:33.160 align:start position:0%
uh the the cost of a uh the actual cost
 
05:54:35.670 --> 05:54:35.680 align:start position:0%
of a custodian would not be in the do25
 
05:54:39.110 --> 05:54:39.120 align:start position:0%
the doe2 has rolled up data um it has
 
05:54:42.468 --> 05:54:42.478 align:start position:0%
instruction salaries um uh student
 
05:54:45.270 --> 05:54:45.280 align:start position:0%
Support Services um in salaries um but
 
05:54:48.350 --> 05:54:48.360 align:start position:0%
it won't get into the exact position um
 
05:54:51.628 --> 05:54:51.638 align:start position:0%
that's in that accounting function so um
 
05:54:53.830 --> 05:54:53.840 align:start position:0%
do25 would probably be a tool that the
 
05:54:55.548 --> 05:54:55.558 align:start position:0%
general court would use but potentially
 
05:54:59.030 --> 05:54:59.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:01.110 --> 05:55:01.120 align:start position:0%

Market from
 
05:55:16.390 --> 05:55:16.400 align:start position:0%
theirs several years ago in a past
 
05:55:18.750 --> 05:55:18.760 align:start position:0%
actually was overturned the committee
 
05:55:21.310 --> 05:55:21.320 align:start position:0%
report I had warned them of overhead
 
05:55:22.708 --> 05:55:22.718 align:start position:0%
costs they were going to have to have
 
05:55:24.628 --> 05:55:24.638 align:start position:0%
their own sped Ed director their own

superintendent um oer River shed two
 
05:55:34.548 --> 05:55:34.558 align:start position:0%
sounds uh the next year my question to
 
05:55:37.590 --> 05:55:37.600 align:start position:0%
you is we never talk about overhead
 
05:55:40.628 --> 05:55:40.638 align:start position:0%
um the SAU structure in New Hampshire
 
05:55:44.030 --> 05:55:44.040 align:start position:0%
was not designed to be economical it's
 
05:55:47.070 --> 05:55:47.080 align:start position:0%
political and I'm just wondering if doe
 
05:55:48.990 --> 05:55:49.000 align:start position:0%
has looked in any way and this is going
 
05:55:52.750 --> 05:55:52.760 align:start position:0%
to learn me theity of all my colleagues
 
05:55:55.830 --> 05:55:55.840 align:start position:0%
has anyone looked at an economic way to
 
05:55:58.468 --> 05:55:58.478 align:start position:0%
reorganize secondary education in New
 
05:56:00.708 --> 05:56:00.718 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so it would be less expensive
 
05:56:02.788 --> 05:56:02.798 align:start position:0%
at the overhead level so we'd have more
 
05:56:05.468 --> 05:56:05.478 align:start position:0%
money at the instructional level so I've
 
05:56:08.110 --> 05:56:08.120 align:start position:0%
not seen the analysis you're discussing
 
05:56:09.628 --> 05:56:09.638 align:start position:0%
um and the department has not done that
 
05:56:11.750 --> 05:56:11.760 align:start position:0%
analysis um the only analysis we have
 
05:56:14.430 --> 05:56:14.440 align:start position:0%
done is we'll analyze uh from time to
 
05:56:16.310 --> 05:56:16.320 align:start position:0%
time analyze administrative cost you can
 
05:56:18.390 --> 05:56:18.400 align:start position:0%
analyze it um you can kind of get two
 
05:56:19.788 --> 05:56:19.798 align:start position:0%
views to look at it you can look at it
 
05:56:22.270 --> 05:56:22.280 align:start position:0%
as a percentage of total expenditures um
 
05:56:23.868 --> 05:56:23.878 align:start position:0%
so a lot of local budget committees are
 
05:56:26.590 --> 05:56:26.600 align:start position:0%
doing that type of of work to see if it
 
05:56:28.190 --> 05:56:28.200 align:start position:0%
how much is it eating up of your total
 
05:56:29.830 --> 05:56:29.840 align:start position:0%
expenditures is it a big section or a
 
05:56:33.030 --> 05:56:33.040 align:start position:0%
small section so um uh we have data on
 
05:56:35.468 --> 05:56:35.478 align:start position:0%
that um and then also you can look at it
 
05:56:37.868 --> 05:56:37.878 align:start position:0%
as a cost per p basis and so we've done
 
05:56:39.910 --> 05:56:39.920 align:start position:0%
analysis on that but nothing nothing to
 
05:56:42.868 --> 05:56:42.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:45.350 --> 05:56:45.360 align:start position:0%
describing yes represent
 
05:56:47.830 --> 05:56:47.840 align:start position:0%
ccom thank you Mr chair thank you Mark
 
05:56:49.628 --> 05:56:49.638 align:start position:0%
for taking my question on the
 
05:56:51.708 --> 05:56:51.718 align:start position:0%
conversation of the MS 25s as we're
 
05:56:54.670 --> 05:56:54.680 align:start position:0%
looking at them online um and we see the
 
05:56:56.510 --> 05:56:56.520 align:start position:0%
various funds that they have going
 
05:56:58.788 --> 05:56:58.798 align:start position:0%
across are the school
 
05:57:01.670 --> 05:57:01.680 align:start position:0%
districts um responsible for reporting
 
05:57:04.750 --> 05:57:04.760 align:start position:0%
all funds that they are making entries
 
05:57:07.390 --> 05:57:07.400 align:start position:0%
in and out of um especially if they're
 
05:57:09.430 --> 05:57:09.440 align:start position:0%
coming out of the general fund and going
 
05:57:10.628 --> 05:57:10.638 align:start position:0%
into a different fund are they
 
05:57:12.468 --> 05:57:12.478 align:start position:0%
responsible for reporting all of those
 
05:57:14.548 --> 05:57:14.558 align:start position:0%
funds to
 
05:57:19.190 --> 05:57:19.200 align:start position:0%
you um generally I I I think I would
 
05:57:20.468 --> 05:57:20.478 align:start position:0%
always refer back to the accounting
 
05:57:22.150 --> 05:57:22.160 align:start position:0%
handbook so the accounting handbook
 
05:57:25.350 --> 05:57:25.360 align:start position:0%
establishes what was in the scope of the
 
05:57:27.270 --> 05:57:27.280 align:start position:0%
reporting that is required for the
 
05:57:29.750 --> 05:57:29.760 align:start position:0%
doe2 um but generally speaking if it's a
 
05:57:32.590 --> 05:57:32.600 align:start position:0%
school educational expense uh an
 
05:57:34.468 --> 05:57:34.478 align:start position:0%
educational expense I would expect to
 
05:57:36.670 --> 05:57:36.680 align:start position:0%
see it on the doe2 if it's general fund
 
05:57:38.830 --> 05:57:38.840 align:start position:0%
expense I would expect to see it on the
 
05:57:42.070 --> 05:57:42.080 align:start position:0%
doe2 um could there be functions that a
 
05:57:44.190 --> 05:57:44.200 align:start position:0%
school performs that is outside that
 
05:57:46.948 --> 05:57:46.958 align:start position:0%
educational realm um and is not reported
 
05:57:48.030 --> 05:57:48.040 align:start position:0%
on the
 
05:57:52.150 --> 05:57:52.160 align:start position:0%
doe2 there could be an example but I I
 
05:57:54.030 --> 05:57:54.040 align:start position:0%
would expect them to all be on the
 
05:57:58.628 --> 05:57:58.638 align:start position:0%
doe2 thank you reent
 
05:58:02.310 --> 05:58:02.320 align:start position:0%
bricky thanks um thank you very much
 
05:58:06.590 --> 05:58:06.600 align:start position:0%
thank you um Mark is so I I think I hear
 
05:58:09.030 --> 05:58:09.040 align:start position:0%
what you're saying so all of these I
 
05:58:11.070 --> 05:58:11.080 align:start position:0%
don't know if you've seen the new the
 
05:58:13.708 --> 05:58:13.718 align:start position:0%
new language of the bill but um the
 
05:58:16.150 --> 05:58:16.160 align:start position:0%
necessary specific resource elements and
 
05:58:18.070 --> 05:58:18.080 align:start position:0%
there's a whole there's a whole list of
 
05:58:18.080 --> 05:58:19.708 align:start position:0%
there's a whole there's a whole list of
them

05:58:19.708 --> 05:58:19.718 align:start position:0%
them
 
05:58:23.430 --> 05:58:23.440 align:start position:0%
Transportation so if I'm hearing you on
 
05:58:27.070 --> 05:58:27.080 align:start position:0%
the doe2 transportation is not included
 
05:58:29.548 --> 05:58:29.558 align:start position:0%
it is included on the doe2 it is not
 
05:58:31.350 --> 05:58:31.360 align:start position:0%
included in the cost per pupil
 
05:58:35.190 --> 05:58:35.200 align:start position:0%
measurement okay all right so I was
 
05:58:37.548 --> 05:58:37.558 align:start position:0%
messing those up thanks so is that the
 
05:58:39.670 --> 05:58:39.680 align:start position:0%
same with like instructional
 
05:58:42.110 --> 05:58:42.120 align:start position:0%
materials uh yes so we would have on the
 
05:58:46.150 --> 05:58:46.160 align:start position:0%
do25 and and um uh uh go ahead and study
 
05:58:47.510 --> 05:58:47.520 align:start position:0%
for yourself but you can see that we
 
05:58:49.708 --> 05:58:49.718 align:start position:0%
have um instruction is function code
 
05:58:52.788 --> 05:58:52.798 align:start position:0%
1100 so we've all oh you you've sign um
 
05:58:54.350 --> 05:58:54.360 align:start position:0%
you've signed off on a few sign a couple
 
05:58:57.750 --> 05:58:57.760 align:start position:0%
sign a couple um uh uh function code
 
05:59:00.868 --> 05:59:00.878 align:start position:0%
1100 is all instruction level and um
 
05:59:03.510 --> 05:59:03.520 align:start position:0%
then we have it broken up by uh salaries
 
05:59:05.510 --> 05:59:05.520 align:start position:0%
benefits and then purchase services so
 
05:59:09.270 --> 05:59:09.280 align:start position:0%
if you're purch in uh supplies Etc um so
 
05:59:10.350 --> 05:59:10.360 align:start position:0%
if you're buying supplies like
 
05:59:12.270 --> 05:59:12.280 align:start position:0%
instructional materials the the cost
 
05:59:14.830 --> 05:59:14.840 align:start position:0%
would live in the doe 25 but could you
 
05:59:17.350 --> 05:59:17.360 align:start position:0%
actually drill in and say this
 
05:59:19.468 --> 05:59:19.478 align:start position:0%
particular book or this particular very
 
05:59:20.868 --> 05:59:20.878 align:start position:0%
difficult to do well we can't do it the
 
05:59:23.230 --> 05:59:23.240 align:start position:0%
do25 the districts could do it okay
 
05:59:25.868 --> 05:59:25.878 align:start position:0%
thanks thank you very much represent
 
05:59:28.110 --> 05:59:28.120 align:start position:0%
Damon thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
05:59:29.830 --> 05:59:29.840 align:start position:0%
helping us with
 
05:59:32.788 --> 05:59:32.798 align:start position:0%
this do you have an observation on why
 
05:59:34.948 --> 05:59:34.958 align:start position:0%
transportation costs are not included in
 
05:59:38.150 --> 05:59:38.160 align:start position:0%
the per people cost cost um so every
 
05:59:41.390 --> 05:59:41.400 align:start position:0%
time I've poked into the question of you
 
05:59:42.910 --> 05:59:42.920 align:start position:0%
know why do we do cost for people this
 
05:59:46.030 --> 05:59:46.040 align:start position:0%
way I I I I've talked to my
 
05:59:49.708 --> 05:59:49.718 align:start position:0%
predecessors um it relates one the
 
05:59:51.270 --> 05:59:51.280 align:start position:0%
answer I've been given is this is the
 
05:59:52.548 --> 05:59:52.558 align:start position:0%
way we've always done it which is the
 
05:59:55.270 --> 05:59:55.280 align:start position:0%
answer everyone hates to hear
 
05:59:58.468 --> 05:59:58.478 align:start position:0%
um to some extent the way it's always
 
06:00:01.230 --> 06:00:01.240 align:start position:0%
been done is nice in a sense it allows a
 
06:00:02.628 --> 06:00:02.638 align:start position:0%
consistent methodology for you to look
 
06:00:05.270 --> 06:00:05.280 align:start position:0%
at the cost PR people in 19 you know 99
 
06:00:07.948 --> 06:00:07.958 align:start position:0%
and compare with now so you know dealing
 
06:00:10.510 --> 06:00:10.520 align:start position:0%
controlling for inflation Etc
 
06:00:13.628 --> 06:00:13.638 align:start position:0%
um I can speculate is transportation is
 
06:00:16.548 --> 06:00:16.558 align:start position:0%
not included because District it's some
 
06:00:18.230 --> 06:00:18.240 align:start position:0%
people use the cost per pupil as their
 
06:00:20.788 --> 06:00:20.798 align:start position:0%
tuition agreement and essentially a
 
06:00:22.590 --> 06:00:22.600 align:start position:0%
district would say yes you can come to
 
06:00:25.270 --> 06:00:25.280 align:start position:0%
our school you can even pay the nhs's
 
06:00:27.750 --> 06:00:27.760 align:start position:0%
cost per pupil rate but you bring the
 
06:00:29.990 --> 06:00:30.000 align:start position:0%
you you send the students you pay for
 
06:00:31.628 --> 06:00:31.638 align:start position:0%
the transportation essentially so that's
 
06:00:33.830 --> 06:00:33.840 align:start position:0%
probably why it's not included because
 
06:00:35.030 --> 06:00:35.040 align:start position:0%
some districts like to use it as a
 
06:00:36.270 --> 06:00:36.280 align:start position:0%
tuition agreement and they want have
 
06:00:39.670 --> 06:00:39.680 align:start position:0%
transportation separate um a separate
 
06:00:39.680 --> 06:00:43.110 align:start position:0%
transportation separate um a separate
separate

06:00:43.110 --> 06:00:43.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:47.548 --> 06:00:47.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:51.948 --> 06:00:51.958 align:start position:0%
you can you make any um
 
06:00:53.990 --> 06:00:54.000 align:start position:0%
observation about how that current
 
06:00:55.070 --> 06:00:55.080 align:start position:0%
structure of not including
 
06:00:57.350 --> 06:00:57.360 align:start position:0%
Transportation costs in per pupil
 
06:01:00.110 --> 06:01:00.120 align:start position:0%
cost complicates comparing between
 
06:01:02.750 --> 06:01:02.760 align:start position:0%
districts since say a widespread
 
06:01:04.590 --> 06:01:04.600 align:start position:0%
Cooperative District probably has a much
 
06:01:07.070 --> 06:01:07.080 align:start position:0%
greater Transportation cost per people
 
06:01:09.948 --> 06:01:09.958 align:start position:0%
than a compact geographically compact
 
06:01:11.830 --> 06:01:11.840 align:start position:0%
District yeah when you go through the
 
06:01:13.430 --> 06:01:13.440 align:start position:0%
exercise of analyzing Transportation
 
06:01:15.110 --> 06:01:15.120 align:start position:0%
cost per people you do see a lot of
 
06:01:17.948 --> 06:01:17.958 align:start position:0%
varying you see some well into the I
 
06:01:18.990 --> 06:01:19.000 align:start position:0%
think maybe there's one out there that's
 
06:01:22.070 --> 06:01:22.080 align:start position:0%
maybe 5,000 um per student um but the
 
06:01:23.750 --> 06:01:23.760 align:start position:0%
averag is kind of hovers around a
 
06:01:26.788 --> 06:01:26.798 align:start position:0%
thousand so and then some are well below
 
06:01:28.590 --> 06:01:28.600 align:start position:0%
that average and some are well above uh
 
06:01:30.750 --> 06:01:30.760 align:start position:0%
above that average but you know as soon
 
06:01:32.150 --> 06:01:32.160 align:start position:0%
as you add that as soon as you add that
 
06:01:34.350 --> 06:01:34.360 align:start position:0%
in to the state average probably a, is
 
06:01:36.430 --> 06:01:36.440 align:start position:0%
dollar impact but it would depend
 
06:01:39.548 --> 06:01:39.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:42.590 --> 06:01:42.600 align:start position:0%
districts uh represent papovich then
 
06:01:42.600 --> 06:01:44.548 align:start position:0%
districts uh represent papovich then
represented

06:01:44.548 --> 06:01:44.558 align:start position:0%
represented
 
06:01:46.708 --> 06:01:46.718 align:start position:0%
fellows the
 
06:01:50.070 --> 06:01:50.080 align:start position:0%
what on Transportation there's a lot
 
06:01:52.150 --> 06:01:52.160 align:start position:0%
more to Transportation you can even look
 
06:01:55.750 --> 06:01:55.760 align:start position:0%
at the inputs and find uh a small amount
 
06:01:58.070 --> 06:01:58.080 align:start position:0%
I believe it's right around $350 per
 
06:02:00.468 --> 06:02:00.478 align:start position:0%
pupil hidden in there in the inputs
 
06:02:03.150 --> 06:02:03.160 align:start position:0%
developed by Senator esterbrook back in
 
06:02:03.160 --> 06:02:06.468 align:start position:0%
developed by Senator esterbrook back in
2008

06:02:06.468 --> 06:02:06.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:08.868 --> 06:02:08.878 align:start position:0%
the the reason on our reports it's
 
06:02:11.430 --> 06:02:11.440 align:start position:0%
separated out to transportation is
 
06:02:13.350 --> 06:02:13.360 align:start position:0%
separated out because sometimes you want
 
06:02:15.750 --> 06:02:15.760 align:start position:0%
to look at just instruction what does
 
06:02:18.670 --> 06:02:18.680 align:start position:0%
the instruction cost and the
 
06:02:20.628 --> 06:02:20.638 align:start position:0%
transportation the other thing about the
 
06:02:22.990 --> 06:02:23.000 align:start position:0%
transportation is that in rural
 
06:02:24.548 --> 06:02:24.558 align:start position:0%
districts is obviously going to be
 
06:02:27.150 --> 06:02:27.160 align:start position:0%
higher in Manchester they use the you
 
06:02:30.430 --> 06:02:30.440 align:start position:0%
know the public transportation so that's
 
06:02:33.270 --> 06:02:33.280 align:start position:0%
why they're separated and it's been like
 
06:02:38.190 --> 06:02:38.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:40.350 --> 06:02:40.360 align:start position:0%
represent papovich thank you Mr chair
 
06:02:43.230 --> 06:02:43.240 align:start position:0%
and thank you Mr mangara for taking
 
06:02:45.670 --> 06:02:45.680 align:start position:0%
questions I know that you brought this
 
06:02:47.548 --> 06:02:47.558 align:start position:0%
up at an earlier presentation this year
 
06:02:49.150 --> 06:02:49.160 align:start position:0%
that there is a significant value to
 
06:02:50.750 --> 06:02:50.760 align:start position:0%
having the longitudinal data and the
 
06:02:53.310 --> 06:02:53.320 align:start position:0%
ability to look at it historically but
 
06:02:55.548 --> 06:02:55.558 align:start position:0%
if that were not a consideration said
 
06:02:57.468 --> 06:02:57.478 align:start position:0%
that you'd maintain the longitudinal
 
06:02:59.390 --> 06:02:59.400 align:start position:0%
data but then you'd also have an
 
06:03:02.150 --> 06:03:02.160 align:start position:0%
enhanced version of a cper you know to
 
06:03:05.030 --> 06:03:05.040 align:start position:0%
educate a people report are there any
 
06:03:07.750 --> 06:03:07.760 align:start position:0%
other changes the department may want to
 
06:03:09.708 --> 06:03:09.718 align:start position:0%
make in order to better reflect the
 
06:03:13.070 --> 06:03:13.080 align:start position:0%
overall cost changes that you that you
 
06:03:15.430 --> 06:03:15.440 align:start position:0%
know the doe may find appropriate again
 
06:03:18.788 --> 06:03:18.798 align:start position:0%
living out the value of the longitudinal
 
06:03:23.548 --> 06:03:23.558 align:start position:0%
stuff um um so we' we've thought about
 
06:03:26.468 --> 06:03:26.478 align:start position:0%
changing the format of our report um um
 
06:03:28.030 --> 06:03:28.040 align:start position:0%
changing it it's been it's been the same
 
06:03:31.990 --> 06:03:32.000 align:start position:0%
format also for SE multiple decade so um
 
06:03:33.430 --> 06:03:33.440 align:start position:0%
I think the challenge with was having
 
06:03:34.990 --> 06:03:35.000 align:start position:0%
multiple competing cost per people
 
06:03:36.390 --> 06:03:36.400 align:start position:0%
metrics out there
 
06:03:40.110 --> 06:03:40.120 align:start position:0%
is the uh it could create confusion so
 
06:03:42.510 --> 06:03:42.520 align:start position:0%
uh I I would I would if we do an
 
06:03:44.190 --> 06:03:44.200 align:start position:0%
analysis I always almost want it to be
 
06:03:46.310 --> 06:03:46.320 align:start position:0%
separate and like almost isolated from
 
06:03:47.708 --> 06:03:47.718 align:start position:0%
the regular metrics we're always
 
06:03:50.350 --> 06:03:50.360 align:start position:0%
producing on a consistent basis um but
 
06:03:53.030 --> 06:03:53.040 align:start position:0%
as far as ad hoc analysis and Reporting
 
06:03:54.910 --> 06:03:54.920 align:start position:0%
if there's any request of this committee
 
06:03:56.590 --> 06:03:56.600 align:start position:0%
um we could look into what we're capable
 
06:03:58.708 --> 06:03:58.718 align:start position:0%
of doing um and showing different looks
 
06:04:00.310 --> 06:04:00.320 align:start position:0%
at Cost PR people than the one that
 
06:04:02.468 --> 06:04:02.478 align:start position:0%
everyone sees um as far as our routine
 
06:04:04.750 --> 06:04:04.760 align:start position:0%
reporting I like it to be as simple as
 
06:04:06.590 --> 06:04:06.600 align:start position:0%
possible to avoid confusion but if
 
06:04:08.430 --> 06:04:08.440 align:start position:0%
there's any analysis requests from the
 
06:04:11.990 --> 06:04:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:14.868 --> 06:04:14.878 align:start position:0%
that the last question to you Mark is
 
06:04:17.628 --> 06:04:17.638 align:start position:0%
that if I look at my do25 form and I
 
06:04:19.230 --> 06:04:19.240 align:start position:0%
take out tuition and
 
06:04:21.030 --> 06:04:21.040 align:start position:0%
transportation and I'm trying to
 
06:04:24.830 --> 06:04:24.840 align:start position:0%
determine what those expenses are for an
 
06:04:28.150 --> 06:04:28.160 align:start position:0%
adequate education is the rest that Doe
 
06:04:29.628 --> 06:04:29.638 align:start position:0%
going to reflect that or they're going
 
06:04:32.868 --> 06:04:32.878 align:start position:0%
to be some decisions made locally that
 
06:04:35.430 --> 06:04:35.440 align:start position:0%
push their expenses out further that are
 
06:04:37.350 --> 06:04:37.360 align:start position:0%
being beyond what the state identifies
 
06:04:38.948 --> 06:04:38.958 align:start position:0%
as an adequate
 
06:04:41.230 --> 06:04:41.240 align:start position:0%
education so it it depends on the
 
06:04:43.708 --> 06:04:43.718 align:start position:0%
methodology if your methodology was to
 
06:04:45.670 --> 06:04:45.680 align:start position:0%
take the all the
 
06:04:48.468 --> 06:04:48.478 align:start position:0%
doe2 and take all expenditure data in
 
06:04:52.270 --> 06:04:52.280 align:start position:0%
there um uh and uh and come up with our
 
06:04:54.110 --> 06:04:54.120 align:start position:0%
state cost per people number and call
 
06:04:57.708 --> 06:04:57.718 align:start position:0%
that an adequate education uh uh the
 
06:04:59.788 --> 06:04:59.798 align:start position:0%
critique would be that included in that
 
06:05:02.750 --> 06:05:02.760 align:start position:0%
doe2 is all expenditures and therefore
 
06:05:04.750 --> 06:05:04.760 align:start position:0%
um some expenditures that are not above
 
06:05:06.430 --> 06:05:06.440 align:start position:0%
and beyond the minimum standards above
 
06:05:08.150 --> 06:05:08.160 align:start position:0%
and beyond the Constitutional adequate
 
06:05:11.548 --> 06:05:11.558 align:start position:0%
education so when the doe2 has all
 
06:05:14.750 --> 06:05:14.760 align:start position:0%
expenditures on it um so if that's your
 
06:05:17.510 --> 06:05:17.520 align:start position:0%
methodology the doe2 is limited and how
 
06:05:19.910 --> 06:05:19.920 align:start position:0%
it can get to a maybe more precise
 
06:05:21.270 --> 06:05:21.280 align:start position:0%
measurement of what is the cost of
 
06:05:24.070 --> 06:05:24.080 align:start position:0%
inadequate education um and then if
 
06:05:26.310 --> 06:05:26.320 align:start position:0%
you're doing uh uh some of the exercises
 
06:05:28.548 --> 06:05:28.558 align:start position:0%
you've seen uh potentially in this bill
 
06:05:30.030 --> 06:05:30.040 align:start position:0%
and some of the exercises you saw back
 
06:05:33.150 --> 06:05:33.160 align:start position:0%
in 2008 um the due2 wouldn't have that
 
06:05:37.590 --> 06:05:37.600 align:start position:0%
data thank you um all right um we have
 
06:05:39.310 --> 06:05:39.320 align:start position:0%
other people want to testify here today
 
06:05:41.190 --> 06:05:41.200 align:start position:0%
so can we let Mark off the
 
06:05:44.670 --> 06:05:44.680 align:start position:0%
hook yes have a good
 
06:06:10.868 --> 06:06:10.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:14.230 --> 06:06:14.240 align:start position:0%
Andy hello um thank you very much for
 
06:06:16.350 --> 06:06:16.360 align:start position:0%
letting me speak today um my name is
 
06:06:20.150 --> 06:06:20.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:23.548 --> 06:06:23.558 align:start position:0%
Penacook and um I also am a mother of
 
06:06:26.868 --> 06:06:26.878 align:start position:0%
two children who are behind me um and I
 
06:06:28.910 --> 06:06:28.920 align:start position:0%
serve on the marac Valley School Board I
 
06:06:31.230 --> 06:06:31.240 align:start position:0%
am here though to represent myself and
 
06:06:33.750 --> 06:06:33.760 align:start position:0%
not the board as a whole um I did send
 
06:06:35.230 --> 06:06:35.240 align:start position:0%
an email this morning but I'd like to
 
06:06:36.270 --> 06:06:36.280 align:start position:0%
kind of
 
06:06:39.430 --> 06:06:39.440 align:start position:0%
uh reaffirm it so I uh as I wrote this
 
06:06:41.468 --> 06:06:41.478 align:start position:0%
morning I'm here to express my strong
 
06:06:43.910 --> 06:06:43.920 align:start position:0%
support for House Bill 550 which seeks
 
06:06:45.788 --> 06:06:45.798 align:start position:0%
to address the urgent need to increase
 
06:06:47.948 --> 06:06:47.958 align:start position:0%
education funding in New Hampshire this
 
06:06:49.868 --> 06:06:49.878 align:start position:0%
bill is a vital first step to ensuring
 
06:06:51.548 --> 06:06:51.558 align:start position:0%
that all students regardless of their
 
06:06:53.468 --> 06:06:53.478 align:start position:0%
zip code have access to the Quality
 
06:06:55.948 --> 06:06:55.958 align:start position:0%
education they deserve House Bill 550
 
06:06:58.230 --> 06:06:58.240 align:start position:0%
establishes a framework to periodically
 
06:06:59.670 --> 06:06:59.680 align:start position:0%
review and adjust funding levels
 
06:07:00.990 --> 06:07:01.000 align:start position:0%
addressing the stagnation that has
 
06:07:02.548 --> 06:07:02.558 align:start position:0%
historically hindered education funding
 
06:07:05.510 --> 06:07:05.520 align:start position:0%
in the past by laying the foundation for
 
06:07:06.910 --> 06:07:06.920 align:start position:0%
for a more Equitable and sustainable
 
06:07:09.270 --> 06:07:09.280 align:start position:0%
system the bill represents progress
 
06:07:11.190 --> 06:07:11.200 align:start position:0%
furthermore it allocates critical
 
06:07:12.990 --> 06:07:13.000 align:start position:0%
resources for essential elements such as
 
06:07:15.190 --> 06:07:15.200 align:start position:0%
facilities like heating our buildings
 
06:07:16.350 --> 06:07:16.360 align:start position:0%
and transportation which are
 
06:07:18.110 --> 06:07:18.120 align:start position:0%
indispensable for the effective
 
06:07:20.750 --> 06:07:20.760 align:start position:0%
operation of our schools as a parent in
 
06:07:22.548 --> 06:07:22.558 align:start position:0%
my district and as someone who serves on
 
06:07:24.110 --> 06:07:24.120 align:start position:0%
my local school board I witness
 
06:07:26.070 --> 06:07:26.080 align:start position:0%
firsthand the profound impact that low
 
06:07:27.788 --> 06:07:27.798 align:start position:0%
State education funding has in our
 
06:07:30.390 --> 06:07:30.400 align:start position:0%
communities each year the primary cost
 
06:07:32.510 --> 06:07:32.520 align:start position:0%
drivers special education Healthcare and
 
06:07:35.110 --> 06:07:35.120 align:start position:0%
retirement funds all which are mandated
 
06:07:38.190 --> 06:07:38.200 align:start position:0%
uh expenses consistently increase these
 
06:07:41.150 --> 06:07:41.160 align:start position:0%
increases directly impact the funding uh
 
06:07:43.070 --> 06:07:43.080 align:start position:0%
resources of school districts and due to
 
06:07:45.030 --> 06:07:45.040 align:start position:0%
the state not providing adequate funding
 
06:07:46.948 --> 06:07:46.958 align:start position:0%
for elements some of which are listed in
 
06:07:49.788 --> 06:07:49.798 align:start position:0%
this bill uh it places an undue burden
 
06:07:51.830 --> 06:07:51.840 align:start position:0%
on the local taxpayers especially in
 
06:07:53.670 --> 06:07:53.680 align:start position:0%
those districts with lower property
 
06:07:55.788 --> 06:07:55.798 align:start position:0%
resources it's the state's duty to fund
 
06:07:57.830 --> 06:07:57.840 align:start position:0%
education adequately to ensure that
 
06:07:59.190 --> 06:07:59.200 align:start position:0%
every student in our state has an
 
06:08:01.628 --> 06:08:01.638 align:start position:0%
equitable access to resources needed to
 
06:08:03.628 --> 06:08:03.638 align:start position:0%
reach their potential and Thrive which
 
06:08:06.110 --> 06:08:06.120 align:start position:0%
in turn will help our state to thrive
 
06:08:08.230 --> 06:08:08.240 align:start position:0%
education is a Cornerstone of a thriving
 
06:08:10.390 --> 06:08:10.400 align:start position:0%
community and a robust economy investing
 
06:08:12.310 --> 06:08:12.320 align:start position:0%
in our schools is not just an investment
 
06:08:14.150 --> 06:08:14.160 align:start position:0%
in our children but in the future of our
 
06:08:16.628 --> 06:08:16.638 align:start position:0%
state the bill is a start to help our
 
06:08:18.750 --> 06:08:18.760 align:start position:0%
communities and I urge you to support uh
 
06:08:20.750 --> 06:08:20.760 align:start position:0%
house Bell 550 to stand up for students
 
06:08:22.350 --> 06:08:22.360 align:start position:0%
families and Educators who depend on
 
06:08:25.070 --> 06:08:25.080 align:start position:0%
Fair and adequate funding the other
 
06:08:26.548 --> 06:08:26.558 align:start position:0%
thing I did not put in the email that I
 
06:08:28.670 --> 06:08:28.680 align:start position:0%
kind of want to uh point out is uh I
 
06:08:29.910 --> 06:08:29.920 align:start position:0%
want to Echo a little bit of what the
 
06:08:32.468 --> 06:08:32.478 align:start position:0%
superintendent from Newport was saying
 
06:08:33.868 --> 06:08:33.878 align:start position:0%
about these are not just numbers on
 
06:08:36.270 --> 06:08:36.280 align:start position:0%
paper these are our kids these are my my
 
06:08:38.310 --> 06:08:38.320 align:start position:0%
children behind me one of which is a
 
06:08:41.190 --> 06:08:41.200 align:start position:0%
recipient of special education um I
 
06:08:43.590 --> 06:08:43.600 align:start position:0%
myself having grown up in New Hampshire
 
06:08:45.910 --> 06:08:45.920 align:start position:0%
though I did leave for a time I returned
 
06:08:48.590 --> 06:08:48.600 align:start position:0%
home um I also received special
 
06:08:53.310 --> 06:08:53.320 align:start position:0%
education and I here as a participant in
 
06:08:56.430 --> 06:08:56.440 align:start position:0%

available for our children who uh whose
 
06:09:05.628 --> 06:09:05.638 align:start position:0%
school districts might not have the
 
06:09:07.788 --> 06:09:07.798 align:start position:0%
resources uh thank you very much and I
 
06:09:09.788 --> 06:09:09.798 align:start position:0%

run these kids home thank you very much
 
06:09:14.830 --> 06:09:14.840 align:start position:0%

06:09:17.110 --> 06:09:17.120 align:start position:0%
committee you're off the hook thank you
 
06:09:18.670 --> 06:09:18.680 align:start position:0%

today with your
 
06:09:26.750 --> 06:09:26.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:41.390 --> 06:09:41.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:54.830 --> 06:09:54.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:58.190 --> 06:09:58.200 align:start position:0%
me good to be able to
 
06:10:00.548 --> 06:10:00.558 align:start position:0%
see thank you Mr chairman my name is
 
06:10:02.310 --> 06:10:02.320 align:start position:0%
David Trumble I'm from the town ofwar
 
06:10:04.948 --> 06:10:04.958 align:start position:0%
and I support this bill um I'd like to
 
06:10:06.990 --> 06:10:07.000 align:start position:0%
go back to the Constitutional element if
 
06:10:07.000 --> 06:10:07.670 align:start position:0%
go back to the Constitutional element if
I

06:10:07.670 --> 06:10:07.680 align:start position:0%
I
 
06:10:11.310 --> 06:10:11.320 align:start position:0%
could the state has a duty to fund the
 
06:10:13.788 --> 06:10:13.798 align:start position:0%
public schools in the state it has to
 
06:10:16.350 --> 06:10:16.360 align:start position:0%
provide an adequate amount of funding
 
06:10:18.910 --> 06:10:18.920 align:start position:0%
and the duty extends to the public
 
06:10:21.390 --> 06:10:21.400 align:start position:0%
schools that's been clear in both the
 
06:10:23.510 --> 06:10:23.520 align:start position:0%
Claremont and the London Dairy
 
06:10:27.150 --> 06:10:27.160 align:start position:0%
decisions when the conal case started as
 
06:10:30.868 --> 06:10:30.878 align:start position:0%
representative luno said it first was U
 
06:10:33.270 --> 06:10:33.280 align:start position:0%
sent up to the Supreme Court who said
 
06:10:35.310 --> 06:10:35.320 align:start position:0%
you need to do more work got sent back
 
06:10:37.070 --> 06:10:37.080 align:start position:0%
back to the Superior Court they had the
 
06:10:37.080 --> 06:10:38.070 align:start position:0%
back to the Superior Court they had the
3-we

06:10:38.070 --> 06:10:38.080 align:start position:0%
3-we
 
06:10:41.270 --> 06:10:41.280 align:start position:0%
trial conal based on 5 years worth of
 
06:10:43.948 --> 06:10:43.958 align:start position:0%
data came up with the numbers all the
 
06:10:45.788 --> 06:10:45.798 align:start position:0%
other school administrators who came to
 
06:10:48.150 --> 06:10:48.160 align:start position:0%
the trial said we concur with conval's
 
06:10:49.708 --> 06:10:49.718 align:start position:0%
numbers and the state offered no
 
06:10:52.070 --> 06:10:52.080 align:start position:0%
evidence to the contrary that's
 
06:10:55.270 --> 06:10:55.280 align:start position:0%
important because the number the 7356 is
 
06:10:57.510 --> 06:10:57.520 align:start position:0%
not just a number derived from a list
 
06:10:58.670 --> 06:10:58.680 align:start position:0%
it's a
 
06:11:01.430 --> 06:11:01.440 align:start position:0%
constitutionally required dollar amount
 
06:11:03.390 --> 06:11:03.400 align:start position:0%
and if the Supreme Court upholds this
 
06:11:05.548 --> 06:11:05.558 align:start position:0%
conval decision the state is not going
 
06:11:07.430 --> 06:11:07.440 align:start position:0%
to be confronted with having to increase
 
06:11:11.910 --> 06:11:11.920 align:start position:0%
base adequacy from 4,000 roughly to7
 
06:11:14.270 --> 06:11:14.280 align:start position:0%
$300 that's going to be a substantial
 
06:11:16.070 --> 06:11:16.080 align:start position:0%
increase but it's constitutionally
 
06:11:18.350 --> 06:11:18.360 align:start position:0%
required I imagine there will be many
 
06:11:20.430 --> 06:11:20.440 align:start position:0%
attempts to knock it down but that won't
 
06:11:22.750 --> 06:11:22.760 align:start position:0%
work because the the the judge in that
 
06:11:25.430 --> 06:11:25.440 align:start position:0%
case said and the superintendent said
 
06:11:27.070 --> 06:11:27.080 align:start position:0%
and they all agreed the number is really
 
06:11:29.510 --> 06:11:29.520 align:start position:0%
10,000 and the judge took conservative
 
06:11:32.270 --> 06:11:32.280 align:start position:0%
estimates on every single element in
 
06:11:34.910 --> 06:11:34.920 align:start position:0%
that case so 7,300 is what we're going
 
06:11:36.628 --> 06:11:36.638 align:start position:0%
to have to to live with in New Hampshire
 
06:11:40.670 --> 06:11:40.680 align:start position:0%
that's the true Base number um then I
 
06:11:43.350 --> 06:11:43.360 align:start position:0%
would like to also go on to the question
 
06:11:45.910 --> 06:11:45.920 align:start position:0%
of what H what's this look like and I'd
 
06:11:47.868 --> 06:11:47.878 align:start position:0%
like to focus on the property poort
 
06:11:51.510 --> 06:11:51.520 align:start position:0%
towns if you go to 7,300 this will make
 
06:11:53.270 --> 06:11:53.280 align:start position:0%
a profound difference in the lives of
 
06:11:55.230 --> 06:11:55.240 align:start position:0%
tens of thousands of students you've
 
06:11:57.230 --> 06:11:57.240 align:start position:0%
heard from Newport but there are many
 
06:11:59.468 --> 06:11:59.478 align:start position:0%
other towns in this state that are in
 
06:12:02.628 --> 06:12:02.638 align:start position:0%
the same situation as Newport that money
 
06:12:04.868 --> 06:12:04.878 align:start position:0%
will go to teachers My Town had the same
 
06:12:06.708 --> 06:12:06.718 align:start position:0%
problem after two or three years the
 
06:12:08.868 --> 06:12:08.878 align:start position:0%
teachers all left because the prices we
 
06:12:10.910 --> 06:12:10.920 align:start position:0%
were the contracts we were offering were
 
06:12:12.750 --> 06:12:12.760 align:start position:0%
too low if you have too many
 
06:12:14.430 --> 06:12:14.440 align:start position:0%
inexperienced teachers there aren't
 
06:12:16.110 --> 06:12:16.120 align:start position:0%
enough experienced teachers in that
 
06:12:18.830 --> 06:12:18.840 align:start position:0%
school to provide the mentorship for the
 
06:12:20.708 --> 06:12:20.718 align:start position:0%
inexperienced teachers that means that
 
06:12:23.390 --> 06:12:23.400 align:start position:0%
children are losing a lot of educational
 
06:12:25.270 --> 06:12:25.280 align:start position:0%
gain that they're not going to get back
 
06:12:28.548 --> 06:12:28.558 align:start position:0%
that has lifelong impacts on them 85% of
 
06:12:30.868 --> 06:12:30.878 align:start position:0%
the children in the state go to a public
 
06:12:33.150 --> 06:12:33.160 align:start position:0%
school we're talking about our future
 
06:12:36.070 --> 06:12:36.080 align:start position:0%
economy our future Society our ability
 
06:12:38.310 --> 06:12:38.320 align:start position:0%
to run a functioning democracy this is
 
06:12:40.350 --> 06:12:40.360 align:start position:0%
not I know it's painful to come up with
 
06:12:42.150 --> 06:12:42.160 align:start position:0%
this much money but it has to be done
 
06:12:44.190 --> 06:12:44.200 align:start position:0%
for the good of the state the second
 
06:12:46.390 --> 06:12:46.400 align:start position:0%
thing is programming you look at AP
 
06:12:48.468 --> 06:12:48.478 align:start position:0%
courses some schools in the state only
 
06:12:51.830 --> 06:12:51.840 align:start position:0%
offer three other schools offer 36 you
 
06:12:53.990 --> 06:12:54.000 align:start position:0%
can't really say you're offering an
 
06:12:55.468 --> 06:12:55.478 align:start position:0%
adequate education to high school
 
06:12:57.750 --> 06:12:57.760 align:start position:0%
students if their school doesn't offer
 
06:13:00.590 --> 06:13:00.600 align:start position:0%
them a full range of AP courses you also
 
06:13:02.350 --> 06:13:02.360 align:start position:0%
can't offer an adequate education if you
 
06:13:03.788 --> 06:13:03.798 align:start position:0%
don't have enough money to offer the
 
06:13:05.590 --> 06:13:05.600 align:start position:0%
remedial courses the found foundational
 
06:13:07.270 --> 06:13:07.280 align:start position:0%
courses kids who have having trouble
 
06:13:09.670 --> 06:13:09.680 align:start position:0%
reading and trouble doing basic math in
 
06:13:11.948 --> 06:13:11.958 align:start position:0%
the early years if you spend the money
 
06:13:13.750 --> 06:13:13.760 align:start position:0%
in the early years and give them that
 
06:13:15.948 --> 06:13:15.958 align:start position:0%
then the rest of their years in public
 
06:13:18.910 --> 06:13:18.920 align:start position:0%
school will be successful if you'd say
 
06:13:20.310 --> 06:13:20.320 align:start position:0%
oh we just couldn't afford it when they
 
06:13:21.830 --> 06:13:21.840 align:start position:0%
were in elementary school they're still
 
06:13:23.670 --> 06:13:23.680 align:start position:0%
going to be struggling in years behind
 
06:13:26.270 --> 06:13:26.280 align:start position:0%
and basic skills as they go through the
 
06:13:28.628 --> 06:13:28.638 align:start position:0%
remaining years the other thing is class
 
06:13:30.708 --> 06:13:30.718 align:start position:0%
sizes all the studies are very clear
 
06:13:33.030 --> 06:13:33.040 align:start position:0%
this is a very simple clear line you
 
06:13:35.150 --> 06:13:35.160 align:start position:0%
have lower class sizes you always get
 
06:13:37.510 --> 06:13:37.520 align:start position:0%
higher results it costs money to do
 
06:13:39.430 --> 06:13:39.440 align:start position:0%
schools right we had this morning School
 
06:13:41.788 --> 06:13:41.798 align:start position:0%
building Aid School building Aid better
 
06:13:44.150 --> 06:13:44.160 align:start position:0%
better results the study show it lower
 
06:13:46.030 --> 06:13:46.040 align:start position:0%
class sizes you get better results you
 
06:13:48.150 --> 06:13:48.160 align:start position:0%
give foundational remedial programs you
 
06:13:50.430 --> 06:13:50.440 align:start position:0%
get better results you have teachers who
 
06:13:52.468 --> 06:13:52.478 align:start position:0%
are experienc you get better results it
 
06:13:54.670 --> 06:13:54.680 align:start position:0%
costs money to run good schools but it's
 
06:13:56.910 --> 06:13:56.920 align:start position:0%
an investment in the future of the state
 
06:13:58.708 --> 06:13:58.718 align:start position:0%
so how does this work in the big picture
 
06:14:00.548 --> 06:14:00.558 align:start position:0%
the low property value talents when you
 
06:14:02.788 --> 06:14:02.798 align:start position:0%
give them this extra 3200 per student
 
06:14:03.830 --> 06:14:03.840 align:start position:0%
they're going to spend it on their
 
06:14:05.510 --> 06:14:05.520 align:start position:0%
schools because their schools
 
06:14:08.390 --> 06:14:08.400 align:start position:0%
desperately need that money the the
 
06:14:10.310 --> 06:14:10.320 align:start position:0%
property Rich towns they can take it and
 
06:14:12.270 --> 06:14:12.280 align:start position:0%
use it for property tax reductions if
 
06:14:14.350 --> 06:14:14.360 align:start position:0%
they want to but there but it's the
 
06:14:17.230 --> 06:14:17.240 align:start position:0%
state's job to come up with the $7,300
 
06:14:18.948 --> 06:14:18.958 align:start position:0%
assuming the Supreme Court upholds this
 
06:14:20.548 --> 06:14:20.558 align:start position:0%
decision it's a
 
06:14:23.310 --> 06:14:23.320 align:start position:0%
constitutionally required number and I
 
06:14:24.670 --> 06:14:24.680 align:start position:0%
think that's the key thing that this
 
06:14:28.230 --> 06:14:28.240 align:start position:0%
bill really gets the second half of it
 
06:14:30.350 --> 06:14:30.360 align:start position:0%
is you can argue about what's little
 
06:14:32.110 --> 06:14:32.120 align:start position:0%
included here and did you have nurses or
 
06:14:33.910 --> 06:14:33.920 align:start position:0%
transportation and so forth but the key
 
06:14:36.468 --> 06:14:36.478 align:start position:0%
thing is if you give 70 300 per you are
 
06:14:37.868 --> 06:14:37.878 align:start position:0%
going to make a big difference in the
 
06:14:39.510 --> 06:14:39.520 align:start position:0%
lives of tens of thousands of children
 
06:14:41.750 --> 06:14:41.760 align:start position:0%
in the state and if you don't we're
 
06:14:43.468 --> 06:14:43.478 align:start position:0%
going to be in the same situation 30
 
06:14:44.990 --> 06:14:45.000 align:start position:0%
years for a whole another generation of
 
06:14:48.070 --> 06:14:48.080 align:start position:0%
children in these towns go in a negative
 
06:14:50.468 --> 06:14:50.478 align:start position:0%
spiral it is unfair to them and this is
 
06:14:52.190 --> 06:14:52.200 align:start position:0%
the time for the state to step up and do
 
06:14:53.708 --> 06:14:53.718 align:start position:0%
the right thing so thank
 
06:14:57.310 --> 06:14:57.320 align:start position:0%
you other questions of Mr
 
06:14:59.590 --> 06:14:59.600 align:start position:0%
Trumble not see thank you very much
 
06:15:01.708 --> 06:15:01.718 align:start position:0%
you're welcome thank you I have no other
 
06:15:10.948 --> 06:15:10.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:14.270 --> 06:15:14.280 align:start position:0%
I've not seen it there is no other than
 
06:15:31.390 --> 06:15:31.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:00.070 --> 06:16:00.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:02.788 --> 06:16:02.798 align:start position:0%
yeah you could ask if you want to go
 
06:16:05.548 --> 06:16:05.558 align:start position:0%
back to him and
 
06:16:07.270 --> 06:16:07.280 align:start position:0%
I mean as an individual you could go
 
06:16:09.910 --> 06:16:09.920 align:start position:0%
back and ask them right now get that
 
06:16:09.920 --> 06:16:14.110 align:start position:0%
back and ask them right now get that
information

06:16:14.110 --> 06:16:14.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:23.390 --> 06:16:23.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:26.150 --> 06:16:26.160 align:start position:0%
you okay we're going to continue here
 
06:16:30.030 --> 06:16:30.040 align:start position:0%
Zach uh Shen welcome thank
 
06:16:31.948 --> 06:16:31.958 align:start position:0%
you uh thank you members of the
 
06:16:33.830 --> 06:16:33.840 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Zach shien I'm the
 
06:16:35.708 --> 06:16:35.718 align:start position:0%
executive director of the New Hampshire
 
06:16:37.590 --> 06:16:37.600 align:start position:0%
school funding fairness project I'm here
 
06:16:40.990 --> 06:16:41.000 align:start position:0%
in support of House Bill 550 uh we're a
 
06:16:43.070 --> 06:16:43.080 align:start position:0%
nonprofit organization that educates
 
06:16:45.590 --> 06:16:45.600 align:start position:0%
citizens and policy makers about the
 
06:16:47.190 --> 06:16:47.200 align:start position:0%
system that we use to fund our Public
 
06:16:50.110 --> 06:16:50.120 align:start position:0%
Schools the impact on property taxes and
 
06:16:52.310 --> 06:16:52.320 align:start position:0%
trying to work towards solutions to uh
 
06:16:53.948 --> 06:16:53.958 align:start position:0%
make both of those systems more
 
06:16:55.708 --> 06:16:55.718 align:start position:0%
Equitable I'm going to skip around a
 
06:16:56.948 --> 06:16:56.958 align:start position:0%
little bit to try not to repeat things
 
06:16:59.070 --> 06:16:59.080 align:start position:0%
that have already been said um I will
 
06:17:00.750 --> 06:17:00.760 align:start position:0%
point out that the um we've talked a lot
 
06:17:02.670 --> 06:17:02.680 align:start position:0%
about the gap between what the state has
 
06:17:04.590 --> 06:17:04.600 align:start position:0%
determined to be the cost of an adequate
 
06:17:04.600 --> 06:17:06.110 align:start position:0%
determined to be the cost of an adequate
educ

06:17:06.110 --> 06:17:06.120 align:start position:0%
educ
 
06:17:09.910 --> 06:17:09.920 align:start position:0%
uh roughly $4,000 in change and the
 
06:17:11.910 --> 06:17:11.920 align:start position:0%
actual per people expenditures which I a
 
06:17:14.628 --> 06:17:14.638 align:start position:0%
part of House Bill 550 um up to about
 
06:17:17.628 --> 06:17:17.638 align:start position:0%
$22,000 per student um a few more
 
06:17:19.030 --> 06:17:19.040 align:start position:0%
numbers based on some of the testimony
 
06:17:21.030 --> 06:17:21.040 align:start position:0%
heard earlier um from the superintendant
 
06:17:24.548 --> 06:17:24.558 align:start position:0%
in Newport um Newport and cipe both have
 
06:17:26.990 --> 06:17:27.000 align:start position:0%
per pupil expenditures of about $26,000
 
06:17:30.350 --> 06:17:30.360 align:start position:0%
per student newport's education tax rate
 
06:17:32.990 --> 06:17:33.000 align:start position:0%
including swept
 
06:17:36.150 --> 06:17:36.160 align:start position:0%
$12.61 Sun's educ tax rate to provide
 
06:17:37.868 --> 06:17:37.878 align:start position:0%
that same amount of per people
 
06:17:37.878 --> 06:17:40.350 align:start position:0%
that same amount of per people
expenditures

06:17:40.350 --> 06:17:40.360 align:start position:0%
expenditures
 
06:17:42.468 --> 06:17:42.478 align:start position:0%
$484 so there's pretty significant
 
06:17:43.910 --> 06:17:43.920 align:start position:0%
impacts based on the ability of the
 
06:17:45.628 --> 06:17:45.638 align:start position:0%
community and the property there to
 
06:17:48.468 --> 06:17:48.478 align:start position:0%
raise that money and these inequities
 
06:17:51.070 --> 06:17:51.080 align:start position:0%
exist explicitly because of the lack of
 
06:17:52.948 --> 06:17:52.958 align:start position:0%
funding from the state which is a
 
06:17:52.958 --> 06:17:55.230 align:start position:0%
funding from the state which is a
constitutional

06:17:55.230 --> 06:17:55.240 align:start position:0%
constitutional
 
06:17:57.590 --> 06:17:57.600 align:start position:0%
responsibility about 70% of all school
 
06:17:59.548 --> 06:17:59.558 align:start position:0%
districts Revenue come from property
 
06:18:02.310 --> 06:18:02.320 align:start position:0%
taxes local property taxes in the state
 
06:18:03.910 --> 06:18:03.920 align:start position:0%
as the highest percentage highest share
 
06:18:06.190 --> 06:18:06.200 align:start position:0%
of any school District uh school funding
 
06:18:08.910 --> 06:18:08.920 align:start position:0%
system in the Country House 550 seeks to
 
06:18:10.868 --> 06:18:10.878 align:start position:0%
address some of these inequities by
 
06:18:13.030 --> 06:18:13.040 align:start position:0%
increasing this base adequacy cost and
 
06:18:14.830 --> 06:18:14.840 align:start position:0%
to be clear from some of the questions
 
06:18:18.310 --> 06:18:18.320 align:start position:0%
this is a shifting of who is paying this
 
06:18:20.230 --> 06:18:20.240 align:start position:0%
the ruling is about shifting some of the
 
06:18:22.110 --> 06:18:22.120 align:start position:0%
burden from the prop local property
 
06:18:24.510 --> 06:18:24.520 align:start position:0%
taxpayers to the state not increasing
 
06:18:26.628 --> 06:18:26.638 align:start position:0%
the size of the pie so to speak for the
 
06:18:28.468 --> 06:18:28.478 align:start position:0%
total amount of public education dollars
 
06:18:31.948 --> 06:18:31.958 align:start position:0%
being spent uh and I think that's an
 
06:18:33.350 --> 06:18:33.360 align:start position:0%
important piece for example if we just
 
06:18:35.548 --> 06:18:35.558 align:start position:0%
did a direct shift it reduce the burden
 
06:18:37.750 --> 06:18:37.760 align:start position:0%
on local property taxpayers from 70% to
 
06:18:39.948 --> 06:18:39.958 align:start position:0%
about 45% I understand there's a lot of
 
06:18:41.788 --> 06:18:41.798 align:start position:0%
complicated mechanisms for where that
 
06:18:43.548 --> 06:18:43.558 align:start position:0%
money is going to come
 
06:18:46.270 --> 06:18:46.280 align:start position:0%
from uh also uh some of other additional
 
06:18:48.708 --> 06:18:48.718 align:start position:0%
claims that have been made um not
 
06:18:50.670 --> 06:18:50.680 align:start position:0%
specifically in this hearing today but
 
06:18:53.190 --> 06:18:53.200 align:start position:0%
um out in the public are explicitly that
 
06:18:55.270 --> 06:18:55.280 align:start position:0%
if the legislature is to follow the conv
 
06:18:57.430 --> 06:18:57.440 align:start position:0%
Val ruling and consequenc
 
06:19:00.390 --> 06:19:00.400 align:start position:0%
hp550 one of the results would be
 
06:19:02.788 --> 06:19:02.798 align:start position:0%
reducing funding in other elements of
 
06:19:04.430 --> 06:19:04.440 align:start position:0%
the education funding formula that are
 
06:19:06.708 --> 06:19:06.718 align:start position:0%
not under adequacy to pay for that base
 
06:19:08.948 --> 06:19:08.958 align:start position:0%
adequacy increase therefore harming some
 
06:19:10.868 --> 06:19:10.878 align:start position:0%
of our most vulnerable communities by
 
06:19:12.628 --> 06:19:12.638 align:start position:0%
reducing some of the so-called right
 
06:19:15.190 --> 06:19:15.200 align:start position:0%
side of the formula that is blatantly
 
06:19:17.190 --> 06:19:17.200 align:start position:0%
not true and would be an active decision
 
06:19:19.628 --> 06:19:19.638 align:start position:0%
by the legislature to cut that funding
 
06:19:21.990 --> 06:19:22.000 align:start position:0%
the ruof ruling has said nothing about
 
06:19:24.110 --> 06:19:24.120 align:start position:0%
reducing funding in one bucket to pay
 
06:19:26.350 --> 06:19:26.360 align:start position:0%
for an increase in base adequacy for the
 
06:19:28.030 --> 06:19:28.040 align:start position:0%
share of the state the state what the
 
06:19:29.510 --> 06:19:29.520 align:start position:0%
state's paying for the cost of
 
06:19:31.910 --> 06:19:31.920 align:start position:0%
inadequate education I want to highlight
 
06:19:35.150 --> 06:19:35.160 align:start position:0%
again that the state over five years uh
 
06:19:37.510 --> 06:19:37.520 align:start position:0%
and millions of dollars of taxpayer
 
06:19:39.910 --> 06:19:39.920 align:start position:0%
funding um paying out of state attorneys
 
06:19:42.868 --> 06:19:42.878 align:start position:0%
during the comat lawsuit presented no
 
06:19:45.230 --> 06:19:45.240 align:start position:0%
evidence to justify the current base
 
06:19:46.750 --> 06:19:46.760 align:start position:0%
adequacy amount they presented
 
06:19:48.750 --> 06:19:48.760 align:start position:0%
absolutely no evidence saying this is an
 
06:19:50.430 --> 06:19:50.440 align:start position:0%
appropriate amount to provide an
 
06:19:52.670 --> 06:19:52.680 align:start position:0%
adequate education for our students the
 
06:19:55.030 --> 06:19:55.040 align:start position:0%
entire case hinged on just attacking the
 
06:19:56.750 --> 06:19:56.760 align:start position:0%
numbers and the witnesses brought on by
 
06:20:00.990 --> 06:20:01.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:04.190 --> 06:20:04.200 align:start position:0%
district I'll conclude um by saying that
 
06:20:06.390 --> 06:20:06.400 align:start position:0%
I think it is a really incredible
 
06:20:08.350 --> 06:20:08.360 align:start position:0%
opportunity this session to have a new
 
06:20:10.910 --> 06:20:10.920 align:start position:0%
committee specifically focused on
 
06:20:12.948 --> 06:20:12.958 align:start position:0%
education funding they're going to be a
 
06:20:15.230 --> 06:20:15.240 align:start position:0%
number of bills that might take pieces
 
06:20:16.548 --> 06:20:16.558 align:start position:0%
of this you've heard them mentioned
 
06:20:18.868 --> 06:20:18.878 align:start position:0%
before relative to education funding
 
06:20:20.788 --> 06:20:20.798 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of bills in Ways and Means
 
06:20:22.430 --> 06:20:22.440 align:start position:0%
are be talking about swept and kind of
 
06:20:24.590 --> 06:20:24.600 align:start position:0%
the revenue side of things and I think
 
06:20:27.510 --> 06:20:27.520 align:start position:0%
that what is really really uh critical
 
06:20:29.788 --> 06:20:29.798 align:start position:0%
is that this committee does
 
06:20:32.788 --> 06:20:32.798 align:start position:0%
something digs into this asks these
 
06:20:34.390 --> 06:20:34.400 align:start position:0%
questions what is a cost of an adequate
 
06:20:36.430 --> 06:20:36.440 align:start position:0%
educ ation how do we cost that out if
 
06:20:37.830 --> 06:20:37.840 align:start position:0%
it's not Rua's number is it the
 
06:20:39.430 --> 06:20:39.440 align:start position:0%
plaintiff's number if it's not those
 
06:20:42.070 --> 06:20:42.080 align:start position:0%
what elements of it hp550 gives a really
 
06:20:45.110 --> 06:20:45.120 align:start position:0%
good place to build from in terms of
 
06:20:47.628 --> 06:20:47.638 align:start position:0%
what specific elements are required or
 
06:20:49.468 --> 06:20:49.478 align:start position:0%
should be required to provide an
 
06:20:49.478 --> 06:20:51.830 align:start position:0%
should be required to provide an
adequate

06:20:51.830 --> 06:20:51.840 align:start position:0%
adequate
 
06:20:54.190 --> 06:20:54.200 align:start position:0%
education I'll um stop there and I'm
 
06:20:56.270 --> 06:20:56.280 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions thank you
 
06:20:57.948 --> 06:20:57.958 align:start position:0%
very much are there any questions from
 
06:20:57.958 --> 06:20:58.708 align:start position:0%
very much are there any questions from
the

06:20:58.708 --> 06:20:58.718 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:20:58.718 --> 06:21:01.708 align:start position:0%
the
committee

06:21:01.708 --> 06:21:01.718 align:start position:0%
committee
 
06:21:03.868 --> 06:21:03.878 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
06:21:05.150 --> 06:21:05.160 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
06:21:07.910 --> 06:21:07.920 align:start position:0%
you mentioned uh in your testimony that
 
06:21:11.670 --> 06:21:11.680 align:start position:0%
newport's tax rate is $12 in change per
 
06:21:14.788 --> 06:21:14.798 align:start position:0%
um resident per thousand whatever uh and
 
06:21:17.750 --> 06:21:17.760 align:start position:0%
that ctie was $4 if we are to increase
 
06:21:20.670 --> 06:21:20.680 align:start position:0%
this adequacy Aid per student how is
 
06:21:22.868 --> 06:21:22.878 align:start position:0%
that going to fix their tax disparity I
 
06:21:24.350 --> 06:21:24.360 align:start position:0%
mean it's going to lower it for both
 
06:21:26.510 --> 06:21:26.520 align:start position:0%
sides right because they're both getting
 
06:21:28.310 --> 06:21:28.320 align:start position:0%
that additional money so how is that
 
06:21:30.030 --> 06:21:30.040 align:start position:0%
going to fix that tax disparity that
 
06:21:31.868 --> 06:21:31.878 align:start position:0%
you're referring to that's a really good
 
06:21:34.310 --> 06:21:34.320 align:start position:0%
question so with that example I was
 
06:21:35.990 --> 06:21:36.000 align:start position:0%
trying to show that both school
 
06:21:37.350 --> 06:21:37.360 align:start position:0%
districts and it's probably not a
 
06:21:38.628 --> 06:21:38.638 align:start position:0%
perfect example it's one I can pull up
 
06:21:40.390 --> 06:21:40.400 align:start position:0%
on my phone real quick both school
 
06:21:41.708 --> 06:21:41.718 align:start position:0%
districts are spending roughly the same
 
06:21:44.510 --> 06:21:44.520 align:start position:0%
amount per pupil but to do that Newport
 
06:21:45.910 --> 06:21:45.920 align:start position:0%
has to and this is just their education
 
06:21:47.750 --> 06:21:47.760 align:start position:0%
tax rate not their full tax burden has
 
06:21:49.670 --> 06:21:49.680 align:start position:0%
to have a tax rate like three times as
 
06:21:52.350 --> 06:21:52.360 align:start position:0%
high and so if the state were to provide
 
06:21:54.110 --> 06:21:54.120 align:start position:0%
more of that funding that would give
 
06:21:55.948 --> 06:21:55.958 align:start position:0%
both those communities at the local
 
06:21:59.750 --> 06:21:59.760 align:start position:0%
level the the P uh um more funding to
 
06:22:02.190 --> 06:22:02.200 align:start position:0%
have that debate what are we going to do
 
06:22:03.670 --> 06:22:03.680 align:start position:0%
maybe for Newport through their
 
06:22:05.670 --> 06:22:05.680 align:start position:0%
budgeting process and and engagement
 
06:22:07.628 --> 06:22:07.638 align:start position:0%
with their local school district maybe
 
06:22:09.670 --> 06:22:09.680 align:start position:0%
they lower their tax rates with half
 
06:22:11.110 --> 06:22:11.120 align:start position:0%
that increase and then are able to
 
06:22:12.190 --> 06:22:12.200 align:start position:0%
increase their salaries for their
 
06:22:13.948 --> 06:22:13.958 align:start position:0%
teachers but that's a decision to be
 
06:22:16.070 --> 06:22:16.080 align:start position:0%
made at the local level so I can't say
 
06:22:17.990 --> 06:22:18.000 align:start position:0%
exactly what each Community will do
 
06:22:19.190 --> 06:22:19.200 align:start position:0%
because every Community through their
 
06:22:20.788 --> 06:22:20.798 align:start position:0%
own process will have a different
 
06:22:22.590 --> 06:22:22.600 align:start position:0%
different priorities but it'll give
 
06:22:24.430 --> 06:22:24.440 align:start position:0%
Newport the ability to make that
 
06:22:26.590 --> 06:22:26.600 align:start position:0%
decision whereas right now due to the
 
06:22:27.948 --> 06:22:27.958 align:start position:0%
fact that they have such low property
 
06:22:29.708 --> 06:22:29.718 align:start position:0%
values on average and so much of the
 
06:22:31.430 --> 06:22:31.440 align:start position:0%
funding comes from property values
 
06:22:33.110 --> 06:22:33.120 align:start position:0%
they're boxed in they don't they don't
 
06:22:35.190 --> 06:22:35.200 align:start position:0%
have wiggle room like like some
 
06:22:37.310 --> 06:22:37.320 align:start position:0%
communities do to say do we want to um
 
06:22:39.310 --> 06:22:39.320 align:start position:0%
maintain taxes this year or do we want
 
06:22:41.070 --> 06:22:41.080 align:start position:0%
to increase salaries they're just saying
 
06:22:43.310 --> 06:22:43.320 align:start position:0%
we got to just survive here so
 
06:22:45.230 --> 06:22:45.240 align:start position:0%
additional funding it will vary
 
06:22:46.948 --> 06:22:46.958 align:start position:0%
Community to community based on what
 
06:22:48.830 --> 06:22:48.840 align:start position:0%
they'd want to do um which I think is
 
06:22:50.590 --> 06:22:50.600 align:start position:0%
really important that communities have
 
06:22:52.548 --> 06:22:52.558 align:start position:0%
that ability to say what do we want to
 
06:22:53.990 --> 06:22:54.000 align:start position:0%
do at the local level do we want to
 
06:22:55.150 --> 06:22:55.160 align:start position:0%
build a new school do we want to
 
06:22:57.070 --> 06:22:57.080 align:start position:0%
increase um teacher salaries do we want
 
06:22:59.350 --> 06:22:59.360 align:start position:0%
to reduce property taxes but it would
 
06:23:01.110 --> 06:23:01.120 align:start position:0%
give a lot more communities the the
 
06:23:02.548 --> 06:23:02.558 align:start position:0%
ability to actually have those
 
06:23:04.548 --> 06:23:04.558 align:start position:0%
conversations whereas right now many
 
06:23:06.350 --> 06:23:06.360 align:start position:0%
don't because the margins are so thin
 
06:23:09.230 --> 06:23:09.240 align:start position:0%
and the taxes are already so
 
06:23:11.390 --> 06:23:11.400 align:start position:0%
high further questions yes
 
06:23:13.750 --> 06:23:13.760 align:start position:0%
representative fellows um yes so so
 
06:23:15.868 --> 06:23:15.878 align:start position:0%
you've been talking about how the tax
 
06:23:18.590 --> 06:23:18.600 align:start position:0%
rates are very different between two
 
06:23:21.230 --> 06:23:21.240 align:start position:0%
districts so I'm pretty sure if I went
 
06:23:24.590 --> 06:23:24.600 align:start position:0%
and I looked at the average home value
 
06:23:27.468 --> 06:23:27.478 align:start position:0%
of the of the average home value in each
 
06:23:29.190 --> 06:23:29.200 align:start position:0%
of those two districts those would be
 
06:23:32.430 --> 06:23:32.440 align:start position:0%
drastically different too so I pretty
 
06:23:34.910 --> 06:23:34.920 align:start position:0%
sure that in Newport they they've got a
 
06:23:38.548 --> 06:23:38.558 align:start position:0%
high tax rate but their typical home is
 
06:23:41.510 --> 06:23:41.520 align:start position:0%
valued a lot lower than the typical home
 
06:23:44.150 --> 06:23:44.160 align:start position:0%
in sunap would you not think that might
 
06:23:46.230 --> 06:23:46.240 align:start position:0%
be how it would look I agree and I think
 
06:23:48.830 --> 06:23:48.840 align:start position:0%
that that is exactly the the Crux of
 
06:23:51.628 --> 06:23:51.638 align:start position:0%
this entire issue the reason that that
 
06:23:53.270 --> 06:23:53.280 align:start position:0%
statement is true and I agree with that
 
06:23:55.510 --> 06:23:55.520 align:start position:0%
and the reason that that is problematic
 
06:23:58.110 --> 06:23:58.120 align:start position:0%
is because the state provides so little
 
06:24:01.030 --> 06:24:01.040 align:start position:0%
funding for our Public Schools the
 
06:24:03.030 --> 06:24:03.040 align:start position:0%
smallest share in the entire country
 
06:24:04.070 --> 06:24:04.080 align:start position:0%
comes from the state for our Public
 
06:24:06.468 --> 06:24:06.478 align:start position:0%
Schools system because of that fact and
 
06:24:08.230 --> 06:24:08.240 align:start position:0%
we have to rely so heavily on local
 
06:24:11.548 --> 06:24:11.558 align:start position:0%
property taxes 70% of all the revenue
 
06:24:14.270 --> 06:24:14.280 align:start position:0%
then the impacts of differing property
 
06:24:16.150 --> 06:24:16.160 align:start position:0%
values in different communities becomes
 
06:24:18.750 --> 06:24:18.760 align:start position:0%
this this huge weight in terms of the
 
06:24:21.270 --> 06:24:21.280 align:start position:0%
the local tax rates so it's it's
 
06:24:23.868 --> 06:24:23.878 align:start position:0%
precisely because of that Dynamic um
 
06:24:25.788 --> 06:24:25.798 align:start position:0%
where a town because they happen to not
 
06:24:27.830 --> 06:24:27.840 align:start position:0%
have a lake or happen to not have a ski
 
06:24:30.150 --> 06:24:30.160 align:start position:0%
Mount or coastline and therefore have
 
06:24:31.590 --> 06:24:31.600 align:start position:0%
lower property values or a former
 
06:24:33.868 --> 06:24:33.878 align:start position:0%
miltown that that you know decades ago
 
06:24:35.670 --> 06:24:35.680 align:start position:0%
right had High property values and now
 
06:24:37.708 --> 06:24:37.718 align:start position:0%
they don't because they get so little
 
06:24:39.190 --> 06:24:39.200 align:start position:0%
from the state then it creates these
 
06:24:41.590 --> 06:24:41.600 align:start position:0%
huge swings in their tax
 
06:24:43.990 --> 06:24:44.000 align:start position:0%
rates further questions from the
 
06:24:46.468 --> 06:24:46.478 align:start position:0%
committee not seeing thank you very much
 
06:24:49.230 --> 06:24:49.240 align:start position:0%
thank you and with that we do not have
 
06:24:50.788 --> 06:24:50.798 align:start position:0%
any other pink cards up here so we're
 
06:24:54.030 --> 06:24:54.040 align:start position:0%
going to close this hearing on
 
06:24:57.670 --> 06:24:57.680 align:start position:0%
550 a you can follow up by individually
 
06:25:00.670 --> 06:25:00.680 align:start position:0%
with him he's right
 
06:25:05.468 --> 06:25:05.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:25:05.478 --> 06:25:08.430 align:start position:0%
 
we're

06:25:08.430 --> 06:25:08.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:25:11.150 --> 06:25:11.160 align:start position:0%
done okay we open up more questions now
 
06:25:14.510 --> 06:25:14.520 align:start position:0%
and it goes and goes and goes it
 
06:25:16.910 --> 06:25:16.920 align:start position:0%
does I'm not going to open it for second
 
06:25:33.230 --> 06:25:33.240 align:start position:0%
