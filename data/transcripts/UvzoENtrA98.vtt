00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 align:start position:0%
removed from the amendment so so all
 
00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:02.360 align:start position:0%
that to do with
 
00:03:04.589 --> 00:03:04.599 align:start position:0%
acupuncture has been removed from the
 
00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 align:start position:0%
amendment does anybody have any
 
00:03:08.589 --> 00:03:08.599 align:start position:0%
questions about
 
00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 align:start position:0%
acupuncture no okay great um the next
 
00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:16.239 align:start position:0%
one has to do with let me just go back
 
00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:17.840 align:start position:0%
let me see if I can
 
00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:21.280 align:start position:0%
find the mlac board I know that there's
 
00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:25.480 align:start position:0%
someone here from them and um what we
 
00:03:30.429 --> 00:03:30.439 align:start position:0%
had um because that also is not going to
 
00:03:32.229 --> 00:03:32.239 align:start position:0%
be addressed by any of the upcoming
 
00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:33.760 align:start position:0%
bills that's going to
 
00:03:37.309 --> 00:03:37.319 align:start position:0%
stay um and then I was given some
 
00:03:40.869 --> 00:03:40.879 align:start position:0%
changes where are they oh here they are
 
00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280 align:start position:0%
from the emac board on some housekeeping
 
00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:49.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:53.079 align:start position:0%
about just a moment it had to do with
 
00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:55.360 align:start position:0%
um RSA
 
00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:57.309 align:start position:0%
um RSA
330c

00:03:57.309 --> 00:03:57.319 align:start position:0%
330c
 
00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:01.079 align:start position:0%
colon 16 Roman
 
00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:06.200 align:start position:0%
numeral Das 2- a either had to do with
 
00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:07.149 align:start position:0%
numeral Das 2- a either had to do with
um

00:04:07.149 --> 00:04:07.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:09.400 align:start position:0%
credentialing and that's been removed
 
00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:12.079 align:start position:0%
that's going to be removed from the bill
 
00:04:14.589 --> 00:04:14.599 align:start position:0%
so is there any questions or concerns
 
00:04:16.189 --> 00:04:16.199 align:start position:0%

Representatives come and speak that
 
00:04:28.749 --> 00:04:28.759 align:start position:0%
would be great and if anybody has any

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:33.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:36.440 align:start position:0%
hand Elizabeth Eaton board counsel to
 
00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:39.240 align:start position:0%
the board of licensed Alcohol and Other
 
00:04:42.909 --> 00:04:42.919 align:start position:0%
Drug use counselors y um and the board
 
00:04:45.029 --> 00:04:45.039 align:start position:0%
just wanted to note a couple of things
 
00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:47.880 align:start position:0%
um thank you for updating on what's
 
00:04:50.909 --> 00:04:50.919 align:start position:0%
already been changed um which version
 
00:04:52.749 --> 00:04:52.759 align:start position:0%
are you working with so that I will on
 
00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:55.880 align:start position:0%
the same page as you I
 
00:04:59.189 --> 00:04:59.199 align:start position:0%
have the original and then I have the
 
00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:02.840 align:start position:0%
clean C copy the the new copy okay let's
 
00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:05.720 align:start position:0%
work with the original
 
00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:08.790 align:start position:0%
work with the original
okay

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:08.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:12.150 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:12.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:17.400 align:start position:0%
on on page eight of the
 
00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:19.840 align:start position:0%
original there's it's at the top of the
 
00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:23.960 align:start position:0%
page line one um it adds a section Roman
 
00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:25.070 align:start position:0%
page line one um it adds a section Roman
numeral

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:25.080 align:start position:0%
numeral
 
00:05:27.629 --> 00:05:27.639 align:start position:0%
2A um and the language is unclear
 
00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:29.280 align:start position:0%
neither the board nor I understood what
 
00:05:31.029 --> 00:05:31.039 align:start position:0%
that was
 
00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:34.280 align:start position:0%
adding that's being removed okay is that
 
00:05:37.309 --> 00:05:37.319 align:start position:0%
the one it's on top of page six for me
 
00:05:40.029 --> 00:05:40.039 align:start position:0%
oh okay I apologize do you see it on top
 
00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:43.080 align:start position:0%
of page six yes okay that's being taken
 
00:05:44.189 --> 00:05:44.199 align:start position:0%
out thank
 
00:05:47.629 --> 00:05:47.639 align:start position:0%
you um and then just two of the repeals
 
00:05:52.629 --> 00:05:52.639 align:start position:0%
were also um we had questions about that
 
00:05:56.309 --> 00:05:56.319 align:start position:0%
um is this on page seven yes so the
 
00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:01.800 align:start position:0%
first one is it RSA 330- C colon 3
 
00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:04.960 align:start position:0%
relative to the liability of the
 
00:06:09.589 --> 00:06:09.599 align:start position:0%
board that's been moved to RSA 310 okay
 
00:06:11.589 --> 00:06:11.599 align:start position:0%
is that the only is that what you had no
 
00:06:16.469 --> 00:06:16.479 align:start position:0%
so the the two concerns were related to
 
00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:21.160 align:start position:0%
um RSA 330 C5 Roman numeral
 
00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:26.720 align:start position:0%
7 which is repealing the um approval or
 
00:06:29.469 --> 00:06:29.479 align:start position:0%
denial and withdrawal of approval for
 
00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:31.120 align:start position:0%
providers of continuing
 
00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:33.720 align:start position:0%
education uh and the board would like
 
00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:37.160 align:start position:0%
that to stay in but maybe read criteria
 
00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:39.960 align:start position:0%
for approval so that they're setting the
 
00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:42.280 align:start position:0%
criteria um and then the office is
 
00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:44.440 align:start position:0%
actually doing the issuing of approval
 
00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:45.830 align:start position:0%
actually doing the issuing of approval
or

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:45.840 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:47.800 align:start position:0%
denial this is
 
00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:49.430 align:start position:0%
denial this is
RSA

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:49.440 align:start position:0%
RSA
 
00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:51.270 align:start position:0%
RSA
330-

00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:51.280 align:start position:0%
330-
 
00:06:54.749 --> 00:06:54.759 align:start position:0%
c57 Roman Ral 7
 
00:06:57.230 --> 00:06:57.240 align:start position:0%
yes and I believe on that page it's on
 
00:07:01.390 --> 00:07:01.400 align:start position:0%
line 13 yep I I see it and I have it
 
00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:04.840 align:start position:0%
this was part the response from oplc was
 
00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:08.160 align:start position:0%
that this has to do with licensing and
 
00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:10.550 align:start position:0%
that this has to do with licensing and
fees

00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:10.560 align:start position:0%
fees
 
00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:13.000 align:start position:0%
the this is for the relative to the
 
00:07:17.749 --> 00:07:17.759 align:start position:0%
powers and duties of the board is um 330
 
00:07:17.759 --> 00:07:19.390 align:start position:0%
powers and duties of the board is um 330
C5

00:07:19.390 --> 00:07:19.400 align:start position:0%
C5
 
00:07:23.350 --> 00:07:23.360 align:start position:0%
okay um and so page okay I'm GNA just
 
00:07:25.830 --> 00:07:25.840 align:start position:0%
myself and not okay page
 
00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:28.440 align:start position:0%
seven and it has to do just with with
 
00:07:31.309 --> 00:07:31.319 align:start position:0%
the co with the Roman numeral 7 right
 
00:07:34.510 --> 00:07:34.520 align:start position:0%
yes under 33 C5 Roman numeral 7 yeah
 
00:07:37.589 --> 00:07:37.599 align:start position:0%
that's it talking about just this one
 
00:07:37.599 --> 00:07:46.510 align:start position:0%
that's it talking about just this one
good

00:07:46.510 --> 00:07:46.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:49.029 --> 00:07:49.039 align:start position:0%
okay all right I'll look into that do do
 
00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:51.120 align:start position:0%
you have if the board or you could come
 
00:07:53.830 --> 00:07:53.840 align:start position:0%
up with some yes I alternative language
 
00:07:55.469 --> 00:07:55.479 align:start position:0%
that would be great absolutely and then
 
00:07:57.749 --> 00:07:57.759 align:start position:0%
one more
 
00:08:00.790 --> 00:08:00.800 align:start position:0%
um and this is just kind of
 
00:08:03.390 --> 00:08:03.400 align:start position:0%
a the the board is just wanting to make
 
00:08:06.230 --> 00:08:06.240 align:start position:0%
you aware that this would be removed um
 
00:08:12.149 --> 00:08:12.159 align:start position:0%
it's on the same page line 18 so RSA 330
 
00:08:15.670 --> 00:08:15.680 align:start position:0%
c165 MH that is relative to the issuance
 
00:08:18.869 --> 00:08:18.879 align:start position:0%
of an mlad act license in that provision
 
00:08:22.629 --> 00:08:22.639 align:start position:0%
um it is if a if an applicant does not
 
00:08:25.230 --> 00:08:25.240 align:start position:0%
meet the requirements for an mlac but
 
00:08:28.029 --> 00:08:28.039 align:start position:0%
they do meet the requirements for leac
 
00:08:30.710 --> 00:08:30.720 align:start position:0%
that allows the uh the issuance of a lak
 
00:08:33.909 --> 00:08:33.919 align:start position:0%
license under that same application uh
 
00:08:35.790 --> 00:08:35.800 align:start position:0%
and the board would would like to keep
 
00:08:39.750 --> 00:08:39.760 align:start position:0%
that uh if it does not conflict with the
 
00:08:44.590 --> 00:08:44.600 align:start position:0%
uh 310 statute okay can you um check
 
00:08:48.910 --> 00:08:48.920 align:start position:0%
with Doug and Doug Mr O OST house yes
 
00:08:54.550 --> 00:08:54.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:57.230 --> 00:08:57.240 align:start position:0%
absolutely and I believe that's
 
00:08:59.030 --> 00:08:59.040 align:start position:0%
everything that I have on behalf of the
 
00:08:59.040 --> 00:08:59.790 align:start position:0%
everything that I have on behalf of the
board

00:08:59.790 --> 00:08:59.800 align:start position:0%
board
 
00:09:03.750 --> 00:09:03.760 align:start position:0%
okay thank you so after um that we have
 
00:09:06.670 --> 00:09:06.680 align:start position:0%
barbering and cosmetology are there any
 
00:09:10.389 --> 00:09:10.399 align:start position:0%
comments okay yes um I also represent
 
00:09:12.710 --> 00:09:12.720 align:start position:0%
barbering and cosmetology and I have um
 
00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:19.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:21.190 align:start position:0%
 
there

00:09:21.190 --> 00:09:21.200 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:09:24.829 --> 00:09:24.839 align:start position:0%
um so this
 
00:09:28.110 --> 00:09:28.120 align:start position:0%
is okay um I'm going to go
 
00:09:32.710 --> 00:09:32.720 align:start position:0%
Section 23 I believe on your page eight
 
00:09:35.389 --> 00:09:35.399 align:start position:0%
yes maintenance of Records oh no
 
00:09:37.430 --> 00:09:37.440 align:start position:0%
barbering c yeah yes maintenance of
 
00:09:40.230 --> 00:09:40.240 align:start position:0%
Records right now that line five says
 
00:09:42.990 --> 00:09:43.000 align:start position:0%
the board shall maintain a record but I
 
00:09:44.910 --> 00:09:44.920 align:start position:0%
believe this should be the office
 
00:09:46.670 --> 00:09:46.680 align:start position:0%
maintaining those
 
00:09:56.590 --> 00:09:56.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:00.069 --> 00:10:00.079 align:start position:0%
office okay there's an editorial
 
00:10:04.350 --> 00:10:04.360 align:start position:0%
issue on line nine um it should just say
 
00:10:09.590 --> 00:10:09.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:12.470 --> 00:10:12.480 align:start position:0%
certificates um within space between and
 
00:10:18.949 --> 00:10:18.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:24.230 --> 00:10:24.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:26.829 --> 00:10:26.839 align:start position:0%
page um report to the office of
 
00:10:28.269 --> 00:10:28.279 align:start position:0%
professional licensure and certification
 
00:10:29.750 --> 00:10:29.760 align:start position:0%
all violation
 
00:10:32.310 --> 00:10:32.320 align:start position:0%
of this chapter that I believe should be
 
00:10:35.389 --> 00:10:35.399 align:start position:0%
repealed as it it's an oplc
 
00:10:35.399 --> 00:10:36.910 align:start position:0%
repealed as it it's an oplc
function

00:10:36.910 --> 00:10:36.920 align:start position:0%
function
 
00:10:40.949 --> 00:10:40.959 align:start position:0%
um we did try to get the office's
 
00:10:43.509 --> 00:10:43.519 align:start position:0%
opinion on on these changes that the
 
00:10:46.069 --> 00:10:46.079 align:start position:0%
board counsil noted um and time just did
 
00:10:48.550 --> 00:10:48.560 align:start position:0%
not allow the communication back from
 
00:10:50.509 --> 00:10:50.519 align:start position:0%
the office so we're making these
 
00:10:53.949 --> 00:10:53.959 align:start position:0%
proposals um and if general counsel
 
00:10:58.030 --> 00:10:58.040 align:start position:0%
disagrees then that's fine okay
 
00:10:58.040 --> 00:11:07.509 align:start position:0%
disagrees then that's fine okay
yeah

00:11:07.509 --> 00:11:07.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:12.150 --> 00:11:12.160 align:start position:0%
right yes it's because in 655 last year
 
00:11:15.790 --> 00:11:15.800 align:start position:0%
we um changed the responsibility of
 
00:11:20.389 --> 00:11:20.399 align:start position:0%
Licensing to a office function and also
 
00:11:25.629 --> 00:11:25.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:28.269 --> 00:11:28.279 align:start position:0%
change yes the amend these are just
 
00:11:28.279 --> 00:11:29.670 align:start position:0%
change yes the amend these are just
oversights

00:11:29.670 --> 00:11:29.680 align:start position:0%
oversights
 
00:11:32.629 --> 00:11:32.639 align:start position:0%
so it should be on line five on page
 
00:11:35.030 --> 00:11:35.040 align:start position:0%
eight it should be the office shall
 
00:11:41.670 --> 00:11:41.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:43.790 --> 00:11:43.800 align:start position:0%
board yes that's right because either
 
00:11:45.230 --> 00:11:45.240 align:start position:0%
are the respon these are the duties of
 
00:11:48.230 --> 00:11:48.240 align:start position:0%
the board I know it's that's why we have
 
00:11:51.590 --> 00:11:51.600 align:start position:0%
to go through this no because these are
 
00:11:53.350 --> 00:11:53.360 align:start position:0%
the responsibility of the board
 
00:11:56.590 --> 00:11:56.600 align:start position:0%
underneath this and these are sort
 
00:11:59.870 --> 00:11:59.880 align:start position:0%
of it's not a continuum of
 
00:12:03.870 --> 00:12:03.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:13.590 --> 00:12:13.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:17.990 align:start position:0%
 
though

00:12:17.990 --> 00:12:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:23.389 --> 00:12:23.399 align:start position:0%
or no because the um the office is where
 
00:12:27.310 --> 00:12:27.320 align:start position:0%
that the office is the administration of
 
00:12:30.710 --> 00:12:30.720 align:start position:0%
oplc and the board are those like the
 
00:12:33.069 --> 00:12:33.079 align:start position:0%
Board of Cosmetology the board of and
 
00:12:35.710 --> 00:12:35.720 align:start position:0%
they are they are responsible for for
 
00:12:37.910 --> 00:12:37.920 align:start position:0%
example setting up a standards and there
 
00:12:39.990 --> 00:12:40.000 align:start position:0%
they're two different
 
00:12:43.269 --> 00:12:43.279 align:start position:0%
functions I know I wish they were thank
 
00:12:47.710 --> 00:12:47.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:51.829 --> 00:12:51.839 align:start position:0%
Eaton continue okay thank you um on the
 
00:12:55.990 --> 00:12:56.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:58.829 --> 00:12:58.839 align:start position:0%
um the we have an outstanding question
 
00:13:00.990 --> 00:13:01.000 align:start position:0%
with the office that uh we haven't
 
00:13:02.670 --> 00:13:02.680 align:start position:0%
received feedback on but I did want to
 
00:13:06.670 --> 00:13:06.680 align:start position:0%
make um you aware as the sponsor that uh
 
00:13:10.710 --> 00:13:10.720 align:start position:0%
the criteria for licensing shops was not
 
00:13:12.629 --> 00:13:12.639 align:start position:0%
included in this section can you tell me
 
00:13:15.509 --> 00:13:15.519 align:start position:0%
what what line or it's just not in here
 
00:13:19.350 --> 00:13:19.360 align:start position:0%
okay are we talking about uh Roman num
 
00:13:24.509 --> 00:13:24.519 align:start position:0%
3 so it would be included near in
 
00:13:27.030 --> 00:13:27.040 align:start position:0%
between um and since this was repealed
 
00:13:29.470 --> 00:13:29.480 align:start position:0%
and re and U reenact I don't know where
 
00:13:33.069 --> 00:13:33.079 align:start position:0%
it would go but in the original language
 
00:13:37.670 --> 00:13:37.680 align:start position:0%
there's um a section 10 which um is Ru
 
00:13:40.310 --> 00:13:40.320 align:start position:0%
making for conditions and standards for
 
00:13:42.710 --> 00:13:42.720 align:start position:0%
operation under a shop license including
 
00:13:45.150 --> 00:13:45.160 align:start position:0%
health and safety standards didn't we
 
00:13:47.110 --> 00:13:47.120 align:start position:0%
get rid of shop licenses we got rid of
 
00:13:49.230 --> 00:13:49.240 align:start position:0%
booth rental licenses Booth rentals okay
 
00:13:51.230 --> 00:13:51.240 align:start position:0%
but shop licenses are pretty important
 
00:13:53.150 --> 00:13:53.160 align:start position:0%
and especially the health and safety
 
00:13:56.350 --> 00:13:56.360 align:start position:0%
standards yeah um so again I haven't
 
00:13:57.590 --> 00:13:57.600 align:start position:0%
received feedback from the office on
 
00:13:59.430 --> 00:13:59.440 align:start position:0%
that but
 
00:14:01.590 --> 00:14:01.600 align:start position:0%
okay and that was section 10
 
00:14:04.710 --> 00:14:04.720 align:start position:0%
correct um so where did that go okay so
 
00:14:06.350 --> 00:14:06.360 align:start position:0%
I don't know it could
 
00:14:09.550 --> 00:14:09.560 align:start position:0%
go I'll we'll we'll find yes I'm sure
 
00:14:09.560 --> 00:14:10.509 align:start position:0%
go I'll we'll we'll find yes I'm sure
you

00:14:10.509 --> 00:14:10.519 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:14:10.519 --> 00:14:13.110 align:start position:0%
you
will

00:14:13.110 --> 00:14:13.120 align:start position:0%
will
 
00:14:17.430 --> 00:14:17.440 align:start position:0%
um and there's a number of places where
 
00:14:19.430 --> 00:14:19.440 align:start position:0%
uh I think direct Courtney has already
 
00:14:21.590 --> 00:14:21.600 align:start position:0%
noted using criteria established by the
 
00:14:24.990 --> 00:14:25.000 align:start position:0%
board should be added um and so I have
 
00:14:27.350 --> 00:14:27.360 align:start position:0%
noted those in my copy but I think
 
00:14:29.389 --> 00:14:29.399 align:start position:0%
Lindsay direct according also already
 
00:14:32.710 --> 00:14:32.720 align:start position:0%
noted those areas so I'm not going to go
 
00:14:34.749 --> 00:14:34.759 align:start position:0%
through every single one right unless no
 
00:14:36.870 --> 00:14:36.880 align:start position:0%
but as long as um
 
00:14:40.749 --> 00:14:40.759 align:start position:0%
so so it's the criteria set by the board
 
00:14:45.350 --> 00:14:45.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:48.670 --> 00:14:48.680 align:start position:0%
here okay this is underneath barbery
 
00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:51.509 align:start position:0%
here okay this is underneath barbery

okay um and that's that's everything
 
00:15:01.389 --> 00:15:01.399 align:start position:0%
that I have for barbering there are a
 
00:15:03.550 --> 00:15:03.560 align:start position:0%
few things that maybe beyond the scope
 
00:15:05.269 --> 00:15:05.279 align:start position:0%
of this amendment that the board would
 
00:15:08.550 --> 00:15:08.560 align:start position:0%
like to change but I don't want to bring
 
00:15:10.629 --> 00:15:10.639 align:start position:0%
it up if it's beyond the scope so okay
 
00:15:13.590 --> 00:15:13.600 align:start position:0%
thank you right okay thank you so now
 
00:15:17.030 --> 00:15:17.040 align:start position:0%

00:19:45.039 --> 00:19:48.830 align:start position:0%
go
ahead

00:19:48.830 --> 00:19:48.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:52.190 --> 00:19:52.200 align:start position:0%
sorry thank you thank you thank you are
 
00:19:54.270 --> 00:19:54.280 align:start position:0%
you talking about Chiropractic fees and
 
00:19:57.950 --> 00:19:57.960 align:start position:0%
qualifications section 44 yes okay I I
 
00:20:01.110 --> 00:20:01.120 align:start position:0%
okay go ahead we we are on SEC what's
 
00:20:04.590 --> 00:20:04.600 align:start position:0%
each applicant shall pay to the Prof
 
00:20:06.270 --> 00:20:06.280 align:start position:0%
office of professional liur
 
00:20:08.149 --> 00:20:08.159 align:start position:0%
certification fee established by the
 
00:20:10.470 --> 00:20:10.480 align:start position:0%
board office corre is that what you're
 
00:20:13.110 --> 00:20:13.120 align:start position:0%
reading yes that is what I'm reading
 
00:20:15.990 --> 00:20:16.000 align:start position:0%
okay um so this section in the statute
 
00:20:18.630 --> 00:20:18.640 align:start position:0%
was uh referencing fees uh there were
 
00:20:22.470 --> 00:20:22.480 align:start position:0%
other various items within there um that
 
00:20:26.630 --> 00:20:26.640 align:start position:0%
needed to be addressed um and I believe
 
00:20:29.830 --> 00:20:29.840 align:start position:0%
this needed to be with the office uh
 
00:20:32.590 --> 00:20:32.600 align:start position:0%
just to review and revise um that
 
00:20:35.270 --> 00:20:35.280 align:start position:0%
section there were just some um items
 
00:20:38.870 --> 00:20:38.880 align:start position:0%
that weren't picked up within
 
00:20:44.230 --> 00:20:44.240 align:start position:0%
um within 316 A5 which needs to be
 
00:20:48.750 --> 00:20:48.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:51.669 --> 00:20:51.679 align:start position:0%
well Mr oout do you do you have a
 
00:20:57.110 --> 00:20:57.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:57.120 --> 00:21:03.789 align:start position:0%
 
that

00:21:03.789 --> 00:21:03.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:06.070 --> 00:21:06.080 align:start position:0%
again my question was just what the
 
00:21:07.830 --> 00:21:07.840 align:start position:0%
references so I can take a look at it
 
00:21:12.190 --> 00:21:12.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:15.149 --> 00:21:15.159 align:start position:0%
modification um three
 
00:21:20.990 --> 00:21:21.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:24.350 --> 00:21:24.360 align:start position:0%
5 and then I believe
 
00:21:27.029 --> 00:21:27.039 align:start position:0%
316a colon
 
00:21:27.039 --> 00:21:28.710 align:start position:0%
316a colon
8

00:21:28.710 --> 00:21:28.720 align:start position:0%
8
 
00:21:30.870 --> 00:21:30.880 align:start position:0%
yep so those just need to be addressed
 
00:21:38.510 --> 00:21:38.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:38.520 --> 00:21:43.470 align:start position:0%
 
office

00:21:43.470 --> 00:21:43.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:46.830 --> 00:21:46.840 align:start position:0%
thank better he lik all right well you
 
00:21:48.710 --> 00:21:48.720 align:start position:0%
know what we'll have to deal with that
 
00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:57.029 align:start position:0%
know what we'll have to deal with that
yeah

00:21:57.029 --> 00:21:57.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:00.029 --> 00:22:00.039 align:start position:0%
separately you might as well are we
 
00:22:01.070 --> 00:22:01.080 align:start position:0%
still on
 
00:22:01.080 --> 00:22:03.149 align:start position:0%
still on
Chiropractic

00:22:03.149 --> 00:22:03.159 align:start position:0%
Chiropractic
 
00:22:09.909 --> 00:22:09.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:13.149 --> 00:22:13.159 align:start position:0%
moment uh no we're that was the only uh
 
00:22:15.310 --> 00:22:15.320 align:start position:0%
those are the only so we can go to board
 
00:22:18.269 --> 00:22:18.279 align:start position:0%
of dental examiners okay any comments on
 
00:22:26.950 --> 00:22:26.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:26.960 --> 00:22:44.990 align:start position:0%
 
examiners

00:22:44.990 --> 00:22:45.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:48.190 --> 00:22:48.200 align:start position:0%
let me let me just find it on your copy
 
00:22:50.470 --> 00:22:50.480 align:start position:0%
real quick well maybe if you just tell
 
00:22:53.350 --> 00:22:53.360 align:start position:0%
me what the section is called yep um
 
00:22:53.360 --> 00:22:55.950 align:start position:0%
me what the section is called yep um
section

00:22:55.950 --> 00:22:55.960 align:start position:0%
section
 
00:22:59.310 --> 00:22:59.320 align:start position:0%
60 section 60
 
00:23:05.430 --> 00:23:05.440 align:start position:0%
okay 60 wow and so it's on page 20 line
 
00:23:09.549 --> 00:23:09.559 align:start position:0%
four yep uh failure to do so may result
 
00:23:11.549 --> 00:23:11.559 align:start position:0%
in the board issuing a non-disciplinary
 
00:23:14.789 --> 00:23:14.799 align:start position:0%
letter of concern to the leny this is
 
00:23:17.909 --> 00:23:17.919 align:start position:0%
inappropriate under the um New statute
 
00:23:17.919 --> 00:23:18.710 align:start position:0%
inappropriate under the um New statute
uh

00:23:18.710 --> 00:23:18.720 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:23:21.190 --> 00:23:21.200 align:start position:0%
oplc uh so it would be the office
 
00:23:23.830 --> 00:23:23.840 align:start position:0%
issuing so I I believe this should be
 
00:23:26.630 --> 00:23:26.640 align:start position:0%
struck this sentence should be
 
00:23:34.149 --> 00:23:34.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:37.510 --> 00:23:37.520 align:start position:0%
okay just as a comment if anyone is here
 
00:23:40.549 --> 00:23:40.559 align:start position:0%
for the LNA qualifications they're
 
00:23:44.630 --> 00:23:44.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:46.190 align:start position:0%
 
305

00:23:46.190 --> 00:23:46.200 align:start position:0%
305
 
00:23:50.190 --> 00:23:50.200 align:start position:0%
good okay and then now there any other
 
00:23:52.669 --> 00:23:52.679 align:start position:0%
comments on dentistry and dental hygiene
 
00:23:55.990 --> 00:23:56.000 align:start position:0%
which is the next one 61 just one uh
 
00:23:58.350 --> 00:23:58.360 align:start position:0%
more comment uh it's in the repeal
 
00:24:02.230 --> 00:24:02.240 align:start position:0%
section on page 21 okay uh again it's
 
00:24:04.830 --> 00:24:04.840 align:start position:0%
just one that is missing from the repeal
 
00:24:07.310 --> 00:24:07.320 align:start position:0%
section there's a there's a section in
 
00:24:09.510 --> 00:24:09.520 align:start position:0%
the dental statute on the professional
 
00:24:09.520 --> 00:24:10.470 align:start position:0%
the dental statute on the professional
health

00:24:10.470 --> 00:24:10.480 align:start position:0%
health
 
00:24:12.750 --> 00:24:12.760 align:start position:0%
program um this is an outstanding
 
00:24:14.830 --> 00:24:14.840 align:start position:0%
question we have with the office uh
 
00:24:16.830 --> 00:24:16.840 align:start position:0%
whether they need a section in their
 
00:24:18.230 --> 00:24:18.240 align:start position:0%
statute on the professional health
 
00:24:22.070 --> 00:24:22.080 align:start position:0%
program or if the oplc statute on the
 
00:24:24.110 --> 00:24:24.120 align:start position:0%
professional health program
 
00:24:27.029 --> 00:24:27.039 align:start position:0%
satisfies can you comment on that Mr do
 
00:24:39.830 --> 00:24:39.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:41.110 --> 00:24:41.120 align:start position:0%
thank you Lindsay Courtney executive
 
00:24:42.789 --> 00:24:42.799 align:start position:0%
director oplc I think you could handle
 
00:24:44.549 --> 00:24:44.559 align:start position:0%
it in one of two ways I don't view it as
 
00:24:47.430 --> 00:24:47.440 align:start position:0%
a conflict essentially there are three
 
00:24:49.750 --> 00:24:49.760 align:start position:0%
boards that are statutorily authorized
 
00:24:52.990 --> 00:24:53.000 align:start position:0%
to have a PHP um one is actually
 
00:24:56.310 --> 00:24:56.320 align:start position:0%
mandatory I think for nursing um but
 
00:24:58.230 --> 00:24:58.240 align:start position:0%
then the office has the ability to
 
00:25:01.750 --> 00:25:01.760 align:start position:0%
provide a PHP pursuant to rules and or
 
00:25:04.510 --> 00:25:04.520 align:start position:0%
contract and so we do provide a PHP to
 
00:25:06.750 --> 00:25:06.760 align:start position:0%
other professions so I think you could
 
00:25:09.630 --> 00:25:09.640 align:start position:0%
either repeal it um because I think we
 
00:25:11.029 --> 00:25:11.039 align:start position:0%
already have the statutary authority or
 
00:25:14.310 --> 00:25:14.320 align:start position:0%
I think you could just leave it as
 
00:25:17.870 --> 00:25:17.880 align:start position:0%
is okay so what is your what's your
 
00:25:22.350 --> 00:25:22.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:24.350 --> 00:25:24.360 align:start position:0%
Eden I believe the board would like to
 
00:25:26.870 --> 00:25:26.880 align:start position:0%
leave it as is okay so we don't it's not
 
00:25:28.630 --> 00:25:28.640 align:start position:0%
missing then
 
00:25:30.750 --> 00:25:30.760 align:start position:0%
no okay we don't need to address that
 
00:25:33.830 --> 00:25:33.840 align:start position:0%
okay great um the next one has to do
 
00:25:35.990 --> 00:25:36.000 align:start position:0%
with dietitians anything anybody here
 
00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:42.470 align:start position:0%
with dietitians anything anybody here
for

00:25:42.470 --> 00:25:42.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:45.789 --> 00:25:45.799 align:start position:0%
dietitians no okay sorry Ricky a medley
 
00:25:48.350 --> 00:25:48.360 align:start position:0%
board Council for dieticians yes um just
 
00:25:53.350 --> 00:25:53.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:56.750 --> 00:25:56.760 align:start position:0%
70 or is there something before that I
 
00:25:59.909 --> 00:25:59.919 align:start position:0%
don't think so no uh the there weren't
 
00:26:01.990 --> 00:26:02.000 align:start position:0%
anything there wasn't anything that
 
00:26:03.149 --> 00:26:03.159 align:start position:0%
needed to be addressed for the
 
00:26:07.830 --> 00:26:07.840 align:start position:0%
dieticians on the original copy or 71
 
00:26:11.470 --> 00:26:11.480 align:start position:0%
okay then we are or 72 section 72
 
00:26:14.830 --> 00:26:14.840 align:start position:0%
right or section
 
00:26:17.389 --> 00:26:17.399 align:start position:0%
74 so that would be that would bring us
 
00:26:22.350 --> 00:26:22.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:25.230 --> 00:26:25.240 align:start position:0%

other professions there are some um
 
00:27:46.630 --> 00:27:46.640 align:start position:0%
items for the future um that would need
 
00:27:51.269 --> 00:27:51.279 align:start position:0%
to be adjusted um but at this time um I
 
00:27:53.310 --> 00:27:53.320 align:start position:0%

establishment since there's nothing that

board is not
 
00:29:19.909 --> 00:29:19.919 align:start position:0%
changing right now we're going to those
 
00:29:22.310 --> 00:29:22.320 align:start position:0%
are repealed I would imag there's
 
00:29:25.430 --> 00:29:25.440 align:start position:0%
nothing about any changes there that's
 
00:29:27.830 --> 00:29:27.840 align:start position:0%

we're going to leave that in because
 
00:29:42.830 --> 00:29:42.840 align:start position:0%
right now even though there's a proposal
 
00:29:45.269 --> 00:29:45.279 align:start position:0%
to take it out we we don't have that
 
00:29:46.470 --> 00:29:46.480 align:start position:0%
hasn't passed yet so we're going to
 
00:29:48.230 --> 00:29:48.240 align:start position:0%
leave that
 
00:29:48.240 --> 00:29:52.470 align:start position:0%
leave that
alone

00:29:52.470 --> 00:29:52.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:56.310 --> 00:29:56.320 align:start position:0%
um the board of okay medical
 
00:29:56.320 --> 00:29:59.190 align:start position:0%

[Music]

00:30:17.990 --> 00:30:18.000 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:30:25.870 --> 00:30:25.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:28.590 --> 00:30:28.600 align:start position:0%
Midwifery the changes noted to the
 
00:30:32.389 --> 00:30:32.399 align:start position:0%
Midwifery statute here are only related
 
00:30:35.630 --> 00:30:35.640 align:start position:0%
to whether they stay a statutory board
 
00:30:38.269 --> 00:30:38.279 align:start position:0%
or go to advisory um if they go to
 
00:30:40.830 --> 00:30:40.840 align:start position:0%
advisory the changes are fine if they
 
00:30:42.789 --> 00:30:42.799 align:start position:0%
stay statutory they should change some
 
00:30:45.830 --> 00:30:45.840 align:start position:0%
of these back from Office board so which
 
00:30:47.950 --> 00:30:47.960 align:start position:0%
ones should change because that's that's
 
00:30:50.430 --> 00:30:50.440 align:start position:0%
a proposal and we haven't passed that
 
00:30:53.389 --> 00:30:53.399 align:start position:0%
yet so I don't want to make any conflict
 
00:30:55.269 --> 00:30:55.279 align:start position:0%
with what's going on right now so what
 
00:30:56.230 --> 00:30:56.240 align:start position:0%
needs to
 
00:30:56.240 --> 00:30:59.470 align:start position:0%
needs to
change

00:30:59.470 --> 00:30:59.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:06.710 --> 00:31:06.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:09.310 --> 00:31:09.320 align:start position:0%
uh so should we leave all the language
 
00:31:12.629 --> 00:31:12.639 align:start position:0%
that's been struck out for example no
 
00:31:15.870 --> 00:31:15.880 align:start position:0%
but I can um I can get you a full
 
00:31:18.070 --> 00:31:18.080 align:start position:0%
written copy of what's here as as should
 
00:31:20.990 --> 00:31:21.000 align:start position:0%
be changed back um okay yeah I can send
 
00:31:26.149 --> 00:31:26.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:26.159 --> 00:31:38.789 align:start position:0%
 
you

00:31:38.789 --> 00:31:38.799 align:start position:0%

naturopathic uh board uh no change
 
00:32:00.070 --> 00:32:00.080 align:start position:0%
uh noted from the language that was
 
00:32:13.830 --> 00:32:13.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:17.789 --> 00:32:17.799 align:start position:0%

Act

00:32:21.669 --> 00:32:21.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:25.789 --> 00:32:25.799 align:start position:0%
129 yes we have a few things noted here
 
00:32:28.629 --> 00:32:28.639 align:start position:0%
um under
 
00:32:35.149 --> 00:32:35.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:37.710 --> 00:32:37.720 align:start position:0%
Authority okay hang on a
 
00:32:41.470 --> 00:32:41.480 align:start position:0%
second under Roman numeral 4 let me find
 
00:32:45.430 --> 00:32:45.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:47.830 --> 00:32:47.840 align:start position:0%
um where the heck is
 
00:32:51.669 --> 00:32:51.679 align:start position:0%
that oh yes okay R number
 
00:32:54.789 --> 00:32:54.799 align:start position:0%
y the stand be meant by and the process
 
00:32:57.629 --> 00:32:57.639 align:start position:0%
approval for right so the process for
 
00:33:00.029 --> 00:33:00.039 align:start position:0%
approval of yes is now an oplc function
 
00:33:02.350 --> 00:33:02.360 align:start position:0%
and should be stricken that that phrase
 
00:33:05.310 --> 00:33:05.320 align:start position:0%
so the standards to be met by education
 
00:33:07.870 --> 00:33:07.880 align:start position:0%
program so we just correct okay take
 
00:33:07.880 --> 00:33:13.909 align:start position:0%
program so we just correct okay take
that

00:33:13.909 --> 00:33:13.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:18.509 --> 00:33:18.519 align:start position:0%
out okay further in Roman numeral 7 yes
 
00:33:21.310 --> 00:33:21.320 align:start position:0%
says the administration of examinations
 
00:33:23.629 --> 00:33:23.639 align:start position:0%
and administration is now no PLC
 
00:33:25.950 --> 00:33:25.960 align:start position:0%
function It should read the requirements
 
00:33:28.710 --> 00:33:28.720 align:start position:0%
for or criteria for either one of those
 
00:33:28.720 --> 00:33:29.669 align:start position:0%
for or criteria for either one of those
would

00:33:29.669 --> 00:33:29.679 align:start position:0%
would
 
00:33:33.029 --> 00:33:33.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:38.190 --> 00:33:38.200 align:start position:0%
criteria for the administration of is
 
00:33:40.669 --> 00:33:40.679 align:start position:0%
that what it's going to
 
00:33:48.750 --> 00:33:48.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:48.760 --> 00:33:51.430 align:start position:0%
 
Administration

00:33:51.430 --> 00:33:51.440 align:start position:0%
Administration
 
00:33:54.430 --> 00:33:54.440 align:start position:0%
okay we'll deal with that we we can talk
 
00:33:58.909 --> 00:33:58.919 align:start position:0%
about that separately okay
 
00:34:02.909 --> 00:34:02.919 align:start position:0%
all right um in uh Roman numeral 10 and
 
00:34:06.629 --> 00:34:06.639 align:start position:0%
I I believe the office also flagged this
 
00:34:11.909 --> 00:34:11.919 align:start position:0%
um persons regulated by the board it has
 
00:34:13.990 --> 00:34:14.000 align:start position:0%
in the original Amendment it has that
 
00:34:16.069 --> 00:34:16.079 align:start position:0%
stricken in office uh it should be
 
00:34:21.270 --> 00:34:21.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:24.270 --> 00:34:24.280 align:start position:0%
board and retired persons regulated by
 
00:34:25.869 --> 00:34:25.879 align:start position:0%
the board as
 
00:34:25.879 --> 00:34:28.470 align:start position:0%
the board as
well

00:34:28.470 --> 00:34:28.480 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:34:32.589 --> 00:34:32.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:35.629 --> 00:34:35.639 align:start position:0%
right all right and then we're at we're
 
00:34:37.990 --> 00:34:38.000 align:start position:0%
continuing anything else on the nurse
 
00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:38.990 align:start position:0%
continuing anything else on the nurse
Practice

00:34:38.990 --> 00:34:39.000 align:start position:0%
Practice
 
00:34:43.349 --> 00:34:43.359 align:start position:0%
Act yes okay um Roman
 
00:34:49.109 --> 00:34:49.119 align:start position:0%
numeral 13 yes um this process for
 
00:34:52.790 --> 00:34:52.800 align:start position:0%
registering practitioners it's a uh the
 
00:34:56.550 --> 00:34:56.560 align:start position:0%
de registration is not a a nursing uh
 
00:34:59.270 --> 00:34:59.280 align:start position:0%
function this normal noral 13 should be
 
00:34:59.280 --> 00:35:02.550 align:start position:0%
function this normal noral 13 should be
stricken

00:35:02.550 --> 00:35:02.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:05.589 --> 00:35:05.599 align:start position:0%
entirely it's not a function of repeat
 
00:35:07.750 --> 00:35:07.760 align:start position:0%
that it's it's not under the authority
 
00:35:09.270 --> 00:35:09.280 align:start position:0%
of the nursing board to require
 
00:35:10.870 --> 00:35:10.880 align:start position:0%
registration with the
 
00:35:10.880 --> 00:35:16.510 align:start position:0%
registration with the
DEA

00:35:16.510 --> 00:35:16.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:22.950 --> 00:35:22.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:25.390 --> 00:35:25.400 align:start position:0%
though we so one of the things that
 
00:35:28.030 --> 00:35:28.040 align:start position:0%
we're doing is we're trying to
 
00:35:29.829 --> 00:35:29.839 align:start position:0%
oh that has to do with lnas never mind
 
00:35:33.390 --> 00:35:33.400 align:start position:0%
all right fine okay um and then in uh
 
00:35:35.710 --> 00:35:35.720 align:start position:0%
Roman numeral 14 it says the
 
00:35:37.470 --> 00:35:37.480 align:start position:0%
implementation of strategies and
 
00:35:40.390 --> 00:35:40.400 align:start position:0%
procedures uh and so procedures should
 
00:35:42.829 --> 00:35:42.839 align:start position:0%
be stricken from that so it reads the
 
00:35:45.589 --> 00:35:45.599 align:start position:0%
implementation of strategies
 
00:35:45.599 --> 00:35:47.750 align:start position:0%
implementation of strategies
necessary

00:35:47.750 --> 00:35:47.760 align:start position:0%
necessary
 
00:35:52.150 --> 00:35:52.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:55.790 --> 00:35:55.800 align:start position:0%
right yes representative goalie has a
 
00:35:55.800 --> 00:35:57.710 align:start position:0%
right yes representative goalie has a
question

00:35:57.710 --> 00:35:57.720 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:36:00.150 --> 00:36:00.160 align:start position:0%
I just want to go back
 
00:36:05.430 --> 00:36:05.440 align:start position:0%
to um 13 process for registering mean I
 
00:36:07.550 --> 00:36:07.560 align:start position:0%
understand the DEA does that process but
 
00:36:09.589 --> 00:36:09.599 align:start position:0%
shouldn't we still be tracking those and
 
00:36:11.950 --> 00:36:11.960 align:start position:0%
have a process of knowing who has that
 
00:36:15.109 --> 00:36:15.119 align:start position:0%
under Federal Regulation and um
 
00:36:17.270 --> 00:36:17.280 align:start position:0%
prescribing control
 
00:36:19.270 --> 00:36:19.280 align:start position:0%
drugs why wouldn't we want to why
 
00:36:20.550 --> 00:36:20.560 align:start position:0%
wouldn't we want to have a registry as
 
00:36:23.630 --> 00:36:23.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:26.910 --> 00:36:26.920 align:start position:0%
DEA uh Lindsay Corney oplc so we do try
 
00:36:29.550 --> 00:36:29.560 align:start position:0%
the information the um statutory
 
00:36:31.270 --> 00:36:31.280 align:start position:0%
Authority was limited to defining the
 
00:36:33.150 --> 00:36:33.160 align:start position:0%
process for registering with the DEA
 
00:36:36.030 --> 00:36:36.040 align:start position:0%
which is a pro the Deo DEA controls that
 
00:36:38.430 --> 00:36:38.440 align:start position:0%
process so I don't know that we could uh
 
00:36:40.349 --> 00:36:40.359 align:start position:0%
adopt rules that would conflict with the
 
00:36:42.710 --> 00:36:42.720 align:start position:0%
DEA process for registering we do
 
00:36:44.270 --> 00:36:44.280 align:start position:0%
capture that information as to whether
 
00:36:47.309 --> 00:36:47.319 align:start position:0%
or not somebody has a DEA number um but
 
00:36:55.670 --> 00:36:55.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:59.270 --> 00:36:59.280 align:start position:0%
process just to clarify I read it as a
 
00:37:00.910 --> 00:37:00.920 align:start position:0%
process for registering practitioners
 
00:37:03.030 --> 00:37:03.040 align:start position:0%
who have been granted
 
00:37:06.309 --> 00:37:06.319 align:start position:0%
special so it this is this is a process
 
00:37:08.990 --> 00:37:09.000 align:start position:0%
for us not for a process to tell them
 
00:37:11.349 --> 00:37:11.359 align:start position:0%
what to do is the way I read it it's a
 
00:37:13.790 --> 00:37:13.800 align:start position:0%
process for the our lies to register
 
00:37:17.069 --> 00:37:17.079 align:start position:0%
with the DEA but that's a DEA process
 
00:37:19.430 --> 00:37:19.440 align:start position:0%
because our lenses aren't registered
 
00:37:21.630 --> 00:37:21.640 align:start position:0%
they have a DEA registration our lenses
 
00:37:24.950 --> 00:37:24.960 align:start position:0%
are licensed so I think that terminology
 
00:37:27.670 --> 00:37:27.680 align:start position:0%
means to me that we would be dictating
 
00:37:29.910 --> 00:37:29.920 align:start position:0%
our lenses process for registering with
 
00:37:29.920 --> 00:37:30.589 align:start position:0%
our lenses process for registering with
the

00:37:30.589 --> 00:37:30.599 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:37:35.069 --> 00:37:35.079 align:start position:0%
DEA um I have a I have a recommendation
 
00:37:37.829 --> 00:37:37.839 align:start position:0%
what if we change it to a regist a
 
00:37:40.270 --> 00:37:40.280 align:start position:0%
registration of practitioners who have
 
00:37:42.030 --> 00:37:42.040 align:start position:0%
been granted a
 
00:37:44.430 --> 00:37:44.440 align:start position:0%
special you could just say requirements
 
00:37:46.589 --> 00:37:46.599 align:start position:0%
for registration I think that would be
 
00:37:48.910 --> 00:37:48.920 align:start position:0%
fine I think when we think of process
 
00:37:50.950 --> 00:37:50.960 align:start position:0%
though we don't want to have any taking
 
00:37:53.150 --> 00:37:53.160 align:start position:0%
the word process out yeah I think so
 
00:37:56.870 --> 00:37:56.880 align:start position:0%
it's just it's a registration of the how
 
00:37:58.630 --> 00:37:58.640 align:start position:0%
how you however you do it it doesn't
 
00:38:00.510 --> 00:38:00.520 align:start position:0%
matter yeah but we want to have that
 
00:38:02.190 --> 00:38:02.200 align:start position:0%
registration of the practitioners who
 
00:38:04.950 --> 00:38:04.960 align:start position:0%
have been granted right so I'm just
 
00:38:10.309 --> 00:38:10.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:12.750 --> 00:38:12.760 align:start position:0%
registration of practitioners who have
 
00:38:15.870 --> 00:38:15.880 align:start position:0%
been granted a special registration that
 
00:38:18.589 --> 00:38:18.599 align:start position:0%
way we have and we can noodle out how
 
00:38:21.710 --> 00:38:21.720 align:start position:0%
we're going to do that later but I'm I'm
 
00:38:23.550 --> 00:38:23.560 align:start position:0%
going to change it for this way right
 
00:38:26.150 --> 00:38:26.160 align:start position:0%
now and then we can discuss how it's
 
00:38:28.870 --> 00:38:28.880 align:start position:0%
going to be done okay because I don't
 
00:38:31.750 --> 00:38:31.760 align:start position:0%
want to get stuck on not that this thing
 
00:38:34.230 --> 00:38:34.240 align:start position:0%
isn't important but okay we still have
 
00:38:38.069 --> 00:38:38.079 align:start position:0%
80 pages to go sure okay so NSE nurse
 
00:38:41.270 --> 00:38:41.280 align:start position:0%
Practice Act section 129 do we have any
 
00:38:44.710 --> 00:38:44.720 align:start position:0%
concerns or questions there no concerns
 
00:38:46.670 --> 00:38:46.680 align:start position:0%
until we get to section
 
00:38:49.710 --> 00:38:49.720 align:start position:0%
133 okay let's let's Buzz over there
 
00:38:51.510 --> 00:38:51.520 align:start position:0%
then if I can does anybody know what
 
00:38:55.270 --> 00:38:55.280 align:start position:0%
page okay 133 that's only on page 41
 
00:38:57.750 --> 00:38:57.760 align:start position:0%
Okay so this is relative to Temporary
 
00:39:00.349 --> 00:39:00.359 align:start position:0%
licenses and I I believe the offices
 
00:39:03.670 --> 00:39:03.680 align:start position:0%
version um removed this section because
 
00:39:06.109 --> 00:39:06.119 align:start position:0%
temporary licenses are now under the
 
00:39:08.430 --> 00:39:08.440 align:start position:0%
oplc um just wanted to note that this
 
00:39:11.069 --> 00:39:11.079 align:start position:0%
should be
 
00:39:13.109 --> 00:39:13.119 align:start position:0%
eliminated oh it's not part of the
 
00:39:16.109 --> 00:39:16.119 align:start position:0%
practice act anymore right the board
 
00:39:17.829 --> 00:39:17.839 align:start position:0%
isn't issuing temporary license the
 
00:39:21.190 --> 00:39:21.200 align:start position:0%
office is so do we have this captured in
 
00:39:24.390 --> 00:39:24.400 align:start position:0%
310 somewhere Mr
 
00:39:27.270 --> 00:39:27.280 align:start position:0%
ound the temporary license is it All
 
00:39:29.309 --> 00:39:29.319 align:start position:0%
Temporary licenses
 
00:39:33.670 --> 00:39:33.680 align:start position:0%
period it's under 3106 ran numeral 5
 
00:39:37.430 --> 00:39:37.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:37.440 --> 00:39:40.390 align:start position:0%
 
right

00:39:40.390 --> 00:39:40.400 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:39:45.150 --> 00:39:45.160 align:start position:0%
yeah okay and as you recall all licenses
 
00:39:47.790 --> 00:39:47.800 align:start position:0%
license approval and denials um that has
 
00:39:50.349 --> 00:39:50.359 align:start position:0%
been transferred to the office thanks I
 
00:39:53.670 --> 00:39:53.680 align:start position:0%
just want to make sure that it's
 
00:39:57.190 --> 00:39:57.200 align:start position:0%
somewhere okay and then Section 1 134 do
 
00:39:59.430 --> 00:39:59.440 align:start position:0%
we have any or 135 or
 
00:40:01.829 --> 00:40:01.839 align:start position:0%
136 we have nothing until
 
00:40:01.839 --> 00:40:03.390 align:start position:0%
136 we have nothing until
138

00:40:03.390 --> 00:40:03.400 align:start position:0%
138
 
00:40:10.309 --> 00:40:10.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:10.319 --> 00:40:11.910 align:start position:0%
 
40

00:40:11.910 --> 00:40:11.920 align:start position:0%
40
 
00:40:11.920 --> 00:40:14.470 align:start position:0%
40
42

00:40:14.470 --> 00:40:14.480 align:start position:0%
42
 
00:40:17.550 --> 00:40:17.560 align:start position:0%
okay yep um and then it's in Roman
 
00:40:20.750 --> 00:40:20.760 align:start position:0%
numeral four oh Roman numeral four okay
 
00:40:25.069 --> 00:40:25.079 align:start position:0%
that's on page 43 the office shall so
 
00:40:28.150 --> 00:40:28.160 align:start position:0%
and this is another question maybe um uh
 
00:40:30.710 --> 00:40:30.720 align:start position:0%
Mr osterhout could speak to it uh the
 
00:40:33.510 --> 00:40:33.520 align:start position:0%
board's duties and uh powers and duties
 
00:40:35.349 --> 00:40:35.359 align:start position:0%
under 326
 
00:40:41.670 --> 00:40:41.680 align:start position:0%
B4 um see it it gives the board um the
 
00:40:45.550 --> 00:40:45.560 align:start position:0%
power to do this periodic review of
 
00:40:48.430 --> 00:40:48.440 align:start position:0%
education programs and standards um and
 
00:40:50.230 --> 00:40:50.240 align:start position:0%
so when this section transfers that
 
00:40:53.349 --> 00:40:53.359 align:start position:0%
power to the office it seems to conflict
 
00:40:55.950 --> 00:40:55.960 align:start position:0%
uh so I just wanted to make note of that
 
00:40:58.550 --> 00:40:58.560 align:start position:0%
and get get the um yours and the
 
00:41:02.190 --> 00:41:02.200 align:start position:0%
office's opinion on uh whether and how
 
00:41:02.200 --> 00:41:04.710 align:start position:0%
office's opinion on uh whether and how
that

00:41:04.710 --> 00:41:04.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:06.910 --> 00:41:06.920 align:start position:0%
conflicts do you have a comment on that
 
00:41:06.920 --> 00:41:14.270 align:start position:0%
conflicts do you have a comment on that
Mr

00:41:14.270 --> 00:41:14.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:17.030 --> 00:41:17.040 align:start position:0%
O I don't think there's a conflict and
 
00:41:18.910 --> 00:41:18.920 align:start position:0%
earlier in this bill we talked about
 
00:41:21.349 --> 00:41:21.359 align:start position:0%
transferring and and I think it's more
 
00:41:23.870 --> 00:41:23.880 align:start position:0%
consistent with the board establishing
 
00:41:26.349 --> 00:41:26.359 align:start position:0%
the criteria and the office doing the
 
00:41:28.150 --> 00:41:28.160 align:start position:0%
approval of the licenses and if that's
 
00:41:30.190 --> 00:41:30.200 align:start position:0%
changing to education programs too which
 
00:41:31.910 --> 00:41:31.920 align:start position:0%
the recommendation from the Board of
 
00:41:34.630 --> 00:41:34.640 align:start position:0%
Nursing was to do and I agree with that
 
00:41:36.589 --> 00:41:36.599 align:start position:0%
then I think the same would hold true
 
00:41:38.710 --> 00:41:38.720 align:start position:0%
here they could set the criteria but we
 
00:41:42.030 --> 00:41:42.040 align:start position:0%
could do that review and then also rely
 
00:41:43.910 --> 00:41:43.920 align:start position:0%
on the subject matter experts if if
 
00:41:47.829 --> 00:41:47.839 align:start position:0%
needed okay is the conflict resolved yes
 
00:41:47.839 --> 00:41:50.630 align:start position:0%
needed okay is the conflict resolved yes
okay

00:41:50.630 --> 00:41:50.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:55.230 --> 00:41:55.240 align:start position:0%
great one more um on in the repeal
 
00:41:55.240 --> 00:41:57.069 align:start position:0%
great one more um on in the repeal
section

00:41:57.069 --> 00:41:57.079 align:start position:0%
section
 
00:41:59.589 --> 00:41:59.599 align:start position:0%
I believe it's already been noted to you
 
00:42:05.309 --> 00:42:05.319 align:start position:0%
but the uh repeal um relative to scope
 
00:42:08.470 --> 00:42:08.480 align:start position:0%
of practice 326 b14 we're going to
 
00:42:10.910 --> 00:42:10.920 align:start position:0%
that's not going to be in there and also
 
00:42:12.550 --> 00:42:12.560 align:start position:0%
um the relative to
 
00:42:14.589 --> 00:42:14.599 align:start position:0%
examinations that's going to that's not
 
00:42:17.030 --> 00:42:17.040 align:start position:0%
going to be repealed okay and then
 
00:42:20.109 --> 00:42:20.119 align:start position:0%
321a is relative to the licensed nursing
 
00:42:22.589 --> 00:42:22.599 align:start position:0%
assistance correct that's staying
 
00:42:25.589 --> 00:42:25.599 align:start position:0%
correct thank you that's it for nursing
 
00:42:27.910 --> 00:42:27.920 align:start position:0%
okay and now um nursing home
 
00:42:30.829 --> 00:42:30.839 align:start position:0%
administrators since they are
 
00:42:34.030 --> 00:42:34.040 align:start position:0%
not they are still aboard right they're
 
00:42:36.630 --> 00:42:36.640 align:start position:0%
not advisory is there anything that
 
00:42:38.630 --> 00:42:38.640 align:start position:0%
needs to be changed here and if so can
 
00:42:40.990 --> 00:42:41.000 align:start position:0%
you just give me the like you will with
 
00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:41.910 align:start position:0%

00:42:51.190 --> 00:42:51.200 align:start position:0%
great that way we don't have to go
 
00:42:54.069 --> 00:42:54.079 align:start position:0%
through all that nursing
 
00:42:56.829 --> 00:42:56.839 align:start position:0%
home admin
 
00:43:08.309 --> 00:43:08.319 align:start position:0%

00:43:54.710 --> 00:43:54.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:57.790 --> 00:43:57.800 align:start position:0%
section one
 
00:44:02.750 --> 00:44:02.760 align:start position:0%
154 um it's under Roman numeral seven
 
00:44:04.750 --> 00:44:04.760 align:start position:0%

taking that out okay that that was my
 
00:44:08.390 --> 00:44:08.400 align:start position:0%
question yeah that's gonna that's going
 
00:44:13.190 --> 00:44:13.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:13.200 --> 00:44:16.270 align:start position:0%
 
is

00:44:16.270 --> 00:44:16.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:20.390 --> 00:44:20.400 align:start position:0%
um anything else to do with
 
00:44:24.990 --> 00:44:25.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:37.430 align:start position:0%
 
Pharmacy

00:44:37.430 --> 00:44:37.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:43.230 --> 00:44:43.240 align:start position:0%
um just one more under Optometry section
 
00:44:43.240 --> 00:44:44.790 align:start position:0%
um just one more under Optometry section
one60

00:44:44.790 --> 00:44:44.800 align:start position:0%
one60
 
00:44:48.710 --> 00:44:48.720 align:start position:0%
um there's a question about uh section
 
00:44:53.349 --> 00:44:53.359 align:start position:0%
150 6 160 Optometry repeals okay yes
 
00:44:55.470 --> 00:44:55.480 align:start position:0%
we're going to leave in relative to
 
00:44:55.480 --> 00:44:57.670 align:start position:0%
we're going to leave in relative to
penalty

00:44:57.670 --> 00:44:57.680 align:start position:0%
penalty
 
00:44:59.549 --> 00:44:59.559 align:start position:0%
we're not going to repeal
 
00:45:01.990 --> 00:45:02.000 align:start position:0%
that is that what you meant is that the
 
00:45:05.230 --> 00:45:05.240 align:start position:0%
concern you had or was it something else
 
00:45:08.670 --> 00:45:08.680 align:start position:0%
no it was the joint credentialing
 
00:45:10.870 --> 00:45:10.880 align:start position:0%
committee I I wasn't sure why this was
 
00:45:14.349 --> 00:45:14.359 align:start position:0%
eliminated but um I believe it's not
 
00:45:14.359 --> 00:45:17.910 align:start position:0%
eliminated but um I believe it's not
been

00:45:17.910 --> 00:45:17.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:20.349 --> 00:45:20.359 align:start position:0%
utilized so that's why we're repealing
 
00:45:23.510 --> 00:45:23.520 align:start position:0%
it I believe so yes okay so we that's
 
00:45:24.870 --> 00:45:24.880 align:start position:0%
going to stay
 
00:45:26.790 --> 00:45:26.800 align:start position:0%
okay all
 
00:45:28.790 --> 00:45:28.800 align:start position:0%
right uh
 
00:45:34.270 --> 00:45:34.280 align:start position:0%
Pharmacy one moment sorry uh there's
 
00:45:36.190 --> 00:45:36.200 align:start position:0%
it's just a lengthy section so I just
 
00:45:39.630 --> 00:45:39.640 align:start position:0%
want to get get I'm on 161 Pharmacy
 
00:45:43.470 --> 00:45:43.480 align:start position:0%
definitions correct
 
00:45:47.349 --> 00:45:47.359 align:start position:0%
um we have nothing until
 
00:45:52.950 --> 00:45:52.960 align:start position:0%
172 um Roman numeral three okay 172 is
 
00:45:56.270 --> 00:45:56.280 align:start position:0%
on page 54 Roman numeral the
 
00:45:57.950 --> 00:45:57.960 align:start position:0%
commissioner shall adopt
 
00:46:01.870 --> 00:46:01.880 align:start position:0%
rules yes um and for uh so the
 
00:46:03.870 --> 00:46:03.880 align:start position:0%
commissioner shall adopt rules under RSA
 
00:46:06.750 --> 00:46:06.760 align:start position:0%
541a to implement this paragraph such
 
00:46:08.549 --> 00:46:08.559 align:start position:0%
rules shall include procedures for
 
00:46:11.430 --> 00:46:11.440 align:start position:0%
addressing complaints and for reporting
 
00:46:13.829 --> 00:46:13.839 align:start position:0%
to the Board of Pharmacy on the status
 
00:46:16.790 --> 00:46:16.800 align:start position:0%
of complaints referred uh I believe that
 
00:46:20.589 --> 00:46:20.599 align:start position:0%
would go to the office uh complaints are
 
00:46:23.349 --> 00:46:23.359 align:start position:0%
uh reported to the office not to the
 
00:46:25.990 --> 00:46:26.000 align:start position:0%
board at this at this time that was in
 
00:46:29.190 --> 00:46:29.200 align:start position:0%
um last year okay so it would be such
 
00:46:31.150 --> 00:46:31.160 align:start position:0%
rules include procedures for addressing
 
00:46:33.230 --> 00:46:33.240 align:start position:0%
complaints and for reporting to the
 
00:46:35.750 --> 00:46:35.760 align:start position:0%
office as a port to the board right I
 
00:46:39.710 --> 00:46:39.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:41.630 --> 00:46:41.640 align:start position:0%
okay all
 
00:46:41.640 --> 00:46:43.549 align:start position:0%
okay all
right

00:46:43.549 --> 00:46:43.559 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:46:49.190 --> 00:46:49.200 align:start position:0%
um and similar comment for uh under 173
 
00:46:53.390 --> 00:46:53.400 align:start position:0%
Section 1 173 yes I get it okay
 
00:46:55.990 --> 00:46:56.000 align:start position:0%
okay and that is all we have for
 
00:46:57.870 --> 00:46:57.880 align:start position:0%
Pharmacy okay then we can move to
 
00:46:57.880 --> 00:46:59.950 align:start position:0%
Pharmacy okay then we can move to
physical

00:46:59.950 --> 00:46:59.960 align:start position:0%
physical
 
00:47:02.390 --> 00:47:02.400 align:start position:0%
therapy just one question uh for
 
00:47:04.069 --> 00:47:04.079 align:start position:0%
physical therapy
 
00:47:06.670 --> 00:47:06.680 align:start position:0%
on in under Section
 
00:47:11.470 --> 00:47:11.480 align:start position:0%
179 yep um the in other practice acts in
 
00:47:14.390 --> 00:47:14.400 align:start position:0%
this amendment uh the injunctive relief
 
00:47:15.990 --> 00:47:16.000 align:start position:0%
statutes have been
 
00:47:18.870 --> 00:47:18.880 align:start position:0%
repealed uh and so the question is why
 
00:47:22.030 --> 00:47:22.040 align:start position:0%
is this staying is it regarding title
 
00:47:26.030 --> 00:47:26.040 align:start position:0%
protection um so that was the question
 
00:47:29.470 --> 00:47:29.480 align:start position:0%
Mr Oster how can you rep can you answer
 
00:47:36.230 --> 00:47:36.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:40.990 --> 00:47:41.000 align:start position:0%
someone well it says RSA 328 of12 is
 
00:47:43.230 --> 00:47:43.240 align:start position:0%
repealed and reenact so you want to know
 
00:47:45.190 --> 00:47:45.200 align:start position:0%
why it's being
 
00:47:48.670 --> 00:47:48.680 align:start position:0%
reenacted okay I it it really is for
 
00:47:50.910 --> 00:47:50.920 align:start position:0%
about title protection um there are
 
00:47:53.309 --> 00:47:53.319 align:start position:0%
certain statutes certain professions
 
00:47:56.230 --> 00:47:56.240 align:start position:0%
have protections on their title in
 
00:47:59.349 --> 00:47:59.359 align:start position:0%
particular um so I think that's the
 
00:48:01.549 --> 00:48:01.559 align:start position:0%
Genesis I I agree though they don't need
 
00:48:03.670 --> 00:48:03.680 align:start position:0%
instructive relief because it is already
 
00:48:05.870 --> 00:48:05.880 align:start position:0%
provided for in 310
 
00:48:05.880 --> 00:48:07.990 align:start position:0%
provided for in 310
MH

00:48:07.990 --> 00:48:08.000 align:start position:0%
MH
 
00:48:11.829 --> 00:48:11.839 align:start position:0%
okay the reflexologist section 181 was
 
00:48:13.990 --> 00:48:14.000 align:start position:0%
removed from the amendment so we are
 
00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:15.390 align:start position:0%
removed from the amendment so we are
going

00:48:15.390 --> 00:48:15.400 align:start position:0%
going
 
00:48:18.950 --> 00:48:18.960 align:start position:0%
to speech language pathology is there
 
00:48:21.309 --> 00:48:21.319 align:start position:0%
any any comments or concerns about
 
00:48:24.670 --> 00:48:24.680 align:start position:0%
speech language pathology section uh yes
 
00:48:29.470 --> 00:48:29.480 align:start position:0%
I do okay one moment
 
00:48:32.950 --> 00:48:32.960 align:start position:0%
please and just to just so the record's
 
00:48:34.309 --> 00:48:34.319 align:start position:0%
clear there were no changes for
 
00:48:36.470 --> 00:48:36.480 align:start position:0%
reflexologist structural integrators and
 
00:48:38.870 --> 00:48:38.880 align:start position:0%
Ag and body work therapists uh from the
 
00:48:41.630 --> 00:48:41.640 align:start position:0%
board Council perspective okay um with
 
00:48:45.710 --> 00:48:45.720 align:start position:0%
speech language pathology uh uh
 
00:48:50.510 --> 00:48:50.520 align:start position:0%
184 there was just an editorial note to
 
00:48:53.430 --> 00:48:53.440 align:start position:0%
its speech language pathology and
 
00:48:56.270 --> 00:48:56.280 align:start position:0%
hearing care providers um um I just want
 
00:48:58.150 --> 00:48:58.160 align:start position:0%
to make sure that is reflected that's
 
00:49:02.430 --> 00:49:02.440 align:start position:0%
that's the way the the statute reads so
 
00:49:05.030 --> 00:49:05.040 align:start position:0%
are you saying that 84 should be called
 
00:49:08.870 --> 00:49:08.880 align:start position:0%
speech language pathology and and
 
00:49:13.069 --> 00:49:13.079 align:start position:0%
hearing care providers and
 
00:49:17.069 --> 00:49:17.079 align:start position:0%
hearing care providers
 
00:49:19.670 --> 00:49:19.680 align:start position:0%
okay all
 
00:49:23.589 --> 00:49:23.599 align:start position:0%
right and then um
 
00:49:26.510 --> 00:49:26.520 align:start position:0%
section 188
 
00:49:29.910 --> 00:49:29.920 align:start position:0%
yep um my understanding from the board
 
00:49:34.150 --> 00:49:34.160 align:start position:0%
uh they reviewed this that uh the
 
00:49:35.910 --> 00:49:35.920 align:start position:0%
reference to the sale and fitting of
 
00:49:39.030 --> 00:49:39.040 align:start position:0%
hearing age should be removed from from
 
00:49:42.349 --> 00:49:42.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:48.190 --> 00:49:48.200 align:start position:0%
struck okay oh yes I see that it should
 
00:49:49.910 --> 00:49:49.920 align:start position:0%
okay all
 
00:49:52.829 --> 00:49:52.839 align:start position:0%
right is that it
 
00:49:56.950 --> 00:49:56.960 align:start position:0%
um I believe so okay so now we're at the
 
00:49:59.230 --> 00:49:59.240 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire board New Hampshire
 
00:50:09.829 --> 00:50:09.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:13.069 --> 00:50:13.079 align:start position:0%
please um there was under
 
00:50:18.270 --> 00:50:18.280 align:start position:0%
197 a comment that we do need to um
 
00:50:20.270 --> 00:50:20.280 align:start position:0%
discuss with the
 
00:50:24.190 --> 00:50:24.200 align:start position:0%
office um regarding substantial
 
00:50:27.470 --> 00:50:27.480 align:start position:0%
equivalency okay that's on page
 
00:50:34.190 --> 00:50:34.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:37.230 --> 00:50:37.240 align:start position:0%
that so 309
 
00:50:40.349 --> 00:50:40.359 align:start position:0%
B6 substantial equivalency uh we just
 
00:50:43.510 --> 00:50:43.520 align:start position:0%
need to consult with the office with
 
00:50:46.670 --> 00:50:46.680 align:start position:0%
respect to that
 
00:50:48.829 --> 00:50:48.839 align:start position:0%
section okay so you're gonna do you have
 
00:50:53.589 --> 00:50:53.599 align:start position:0%
a comment Mr to have I think that's the
 
00:50:56.190 --> 00:50:56.200 align:start position:0%
process we're using under 3107
 
00:50:58.750 --> 00:50:58.760 align:start position:0%
anyway so the language might be a little
 
00:51:01.150 --> 00:51:01.160 align:start position:0%
redundant but I don't see any
 
00:51:04.190 --> 00:51:04.200 align:start position:0%
conflict why don't we just take it out
 
00:51:05.470 --> 00:51:05.480 align:start position:0%
so we're going to
 
00:51:07.630 --> 00:51:07.640 align:start position:0%
remove we're not going to have we're
 
00:51:09.670 --> 00:51:09.680 align:start position:0%
just going to eliminate it and we're not
 
00:51:11.069 --> 00:51:11.079 align:start position:0%
going to it's just going to say it's
 
00:51:12.470 --> 00:51:12.480 align:start position:0%
going to be repealed and we're not going
 
00:51:15.430 --> 00:51:15.440 align:start position:0%
to reenact it okay we don't need it we
 
00:51:16.910 --> 00:51:16.920 align:start position:0%
don't need it in two places because
 
00:51:18.750 --> 00:51:18.760 align:start position:0%
that's a problem if we have to change
 
00:51:18.760 --> 00:51:20.950 align:start position:0%
that's a problem if we have to change
something

00:51:20.950 --> 00:51:20.960 align:start position:0%
something
 
00:51:24.349 --> 00:51:24.359 align:start position:0%
later um is that the only comment Miss
 
00:51:33.630 --> 00:51:33.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:36.950 --> 00:51:36.960 align:start position:0%
sure yes did somebody have a question oh
 
00:51:40.109 --> 00:51:40.119 align:start position:0%
you said bless you how kind that that is
 
00:51:43.750 --> 00:51:43.760 align:start position:0%
all for uh the accountancy okay
 
00:51:49.829 --> 00:51:49.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:54.349 --> 00:51:54.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:54.359 --> 00:52:04.829 align:start position:0%
 
love

00:52:04.829 --> 00:52:04.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:12.910 --> 00:52:12.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:12.920 --> 00:52:17.670 align:start position:0%
 
I've

00:52:17.670 --> 00:52:17.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:17.680 --> 00:52:19.670 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:52:19.670 --> 00:52:19.680 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:52:23.990 --> 00:52:24.000 align:start position:0%
Architects page 70 the bottom of page 70
 
00:52:26.549 --> 00:52:26.559 align:start position:0%
are there any comments on AR
 
00:52:30.349 --> 00:52:30.359 align:start position:0%
Tex um excuse me not for this bill in
 
00:52:32.309 --> 00:52:32.319 align:start position:0%
the future I think there's going to be
 
00:52:35.390 --> 00:52:35.400 align:start position:0%
some um changes that will need to be
 
00:52:38.109 --> 00:52:38.119 align:start position:0%
made okay and why why are we saying that
 
00:52:41.109 --> 00:52:41.119 align:start position:0%
in the future um it doesn't fit under
 
00:52:45.349 --> 00:52:45.359 align:start position:0%
the scope of this bill okay um okay
 
00:52:45.359 --> 00:52:50.230 align:start position:0%
the scope of this bill okay um okay
Architects

00:52:50.230 --> 00:52:50.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:52.510 --> 00:52:52.520 align:start position:0%
auctioneers um auctioneers under the
 
00:52:54.549 --> 00:52:54.559 align:start position:0%
scope of this bill we do not have any
 
00:52:56.630 --> 00:52:56.640 align:start position:0%
changes again and that's another one in
 
00:53:00.510 --> 00:53:00.520 align:start position:0%
the future okay court reporters so court
 
00:53:03.630 --> 00:53:03.640 align:start position:0%
reporters still exist so we're going to
 
00:53:05.589 --> 00:53:05.599 align:start position:0%
pretend that that we we're going to so
 
00:53:07.069 --> 00:53:07.079 align:start position:0%
do we who's going to rewrite this
 
00:53:08.829 --> 00:53:08.839 align:start position:0%
section on court reporters because I
 
00:53:10.109 --> 00:53:10.119 align:start position:0%
think this was written as if it was
 
00:53:13.270 --> 00:53:13.280 align:start position:0%
going to be an Advisory Board correct or
 
00:53:13.280 --> 00:53:13.950 align:start position:0%
going to be an Advisory Board correct or
am

00:53:13.950 --> 00:53:13.960 align:start position:0%
am
 
00:53:19.309 --> 00:53:19.319 align:start position:0%
I no the bill proposed was to eliminate
 
00:53:22.230 --> 00:53:22.240 align:start position:0%
Court repor a lure right and that failed
 
00:53:24.390 --> 00:53:24.400 align:start position:0%
so I can take a look at the language but
 
00:53:26.109 --> 00:53:26.119 align:start position:0%
this should be written if the cour rep
 
00:53:27.710 --> 00:53:27.720 align:start position:0%
okay so Mr Oster how you're going to
 
00:53:31.430 --> 00:53:31.440 align:start position:0%
look at section 218 court
 
00:53:33.470 --> 00:53:33.480 align:start position:0%
reporters okay so I just want you to
 
00:53:35.870 --> 00:53:35.880 align:start position:0%
know we have to exec this by next
 
00:53:35.880 --> 00:53:37.910 align:start position:0%
know we have to exec this by next
Wednesday

00:53:37.910 --> 00:53:37.920 align:start position:0%
Wednesday
 
00:53:41.069 --> 00:53:41.079 align:start position:0%
so we'll talk about when because this
 
00:53:43.510 --> 00:53:43.520 align:start position:0%
still has to go to OS and they're
 
00:53:47.349 --> 00:53:47.359 align:start position:0%
they're finishing up this Draft
 
00:53:49.470 --> 00:53:49.480 align:start position:0%
today I think you all should send them
 
00:53:51.309 --> 00:53:51.319 align:start position:0%
some flowers after
 
00:53:51.319 --> 00:53:53.309 align:start position:0%
some flowers after
that

00:53:53.309 --> 00:53:53.319 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:53:56.069 --> 00:53:56.079 align:start position:0%
um I'll help with the
 
00:53:56.079 --> 00:53:59.750 align:start position:0%
um I'll help with the
flowers

00:53:59.750 --> 00:53:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:03.589 --> 00:54:03.599 align:start position:0%
um electricians finally electricians do
 
00:54:06.910 --> 00:54:06.920 align:start position:0%
we have any so uh Elizabeth eaten board
 
00:54:10.750 --> 00:54:10.760 align:start position:0%
Council for electricians um and I just
 
00:54:14.230 --> 00:54:14.240 align:start position:0%
have three um areas that are being
 
00:54:17.750 --> 00:54:17.760 align:start position:0%
repealed that the board uh wants to note
 
00:54:19.910 --> 00:54:19.920 align:start position:0%
that shouldn't be repealed okay let me
 
00:54:24.069 --> 00:54:24.079 align:start position:0%
just make sure oh that's on page um
 
00:54:26.789 --> 00:54:26.799 align:start position:0%
76 oh no that's court reporters wait a
 
00:54:29.789 --> 00:54:29.799 align:start position:0%
minute it's there uh section 223 it is
 
00:54:34.109 --> 00:54:34.119 align:start position:0%
on page 76 okay yep so the first line um
 
00:54:36.549 --> 00:54:36.559 align:start position:0%
24 a journeyman electrician shall be
 
00:54:39.150 --> 00:54:39.160 align:start position:0%
employed by a master electrician uh the
 
00:54:41.950 --> 00:54:41.960 align:start position:0%
board considers this to be a public
 
00:54:45.910 --> 00:54:45.920 align:start position:0%
safety uh matter um there are additional
 
00:54:47.670 --> 00:54:47.680 align:start position:0%
steps that a journeyman needs to take to
 
00:54:49.910 --> 00:54:49.920 align:start position:0%
become a master including business
 
00:54:53.670 --> 00:54:53.680 align:start position:0%
education and and other such matters uh
 
00:54:55.829 --> 00:54:55.839 align:start position:0%
and the concern is that a a journeyman
 
00:55:00.510 --> 00:55:00.520 align:start position:0%
will be a 1099 uh contractor with an a
 
00:55:02.150 --> 00:55:02.160 align:start position:0%
master and they they think that that
 
00:55:03.829 --> 00:55:03.839 align:start position:0%
relationship is in appropriate for the
 
00:55:06.109 --> 00:55:06.119 align:start position:0%
supervision level required so they're
 
00:55:09.230 --> 00:55:09.240 align:start position:0%
not um the next sentence I think
 
00:55:11.030 --> 00:55:11.040 align:start position:0%
clarifies that by saying that each
 
00:55:12.789 --> 00:55:12.799 align:start position:0%
Journeyman Electrician shall work under
 
00:55:14.150 --> 00:55:14.160 align:start position:0%
the direction and supervision of a
 
00:55:16.789 --> 00:55:16.799 align:start position:0%
master electrician you think that's too
 
00:55:20.150 --> 00:55:20.160 align:start position:0%
loose the board wanted to well the board
 
00:55:21.710 --> 00:55:21.720 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry not you personally when I see
 
00:55:23.190 --> 00:55:23.200 align:start position:0%
you I'm talking about the electrician
 
00:55:24.630 --> 00:55:24.640 align:start position:0%
board please the board really wanted to
 
00:55:27.349 --> 00:55:27.359 align:start position:0%
tighten up that uh employer employee
 
00:55:27.359 --> 00:55:30.549 align:start position:0%
tighten up that uh employer employee
relationship

00:55:30.549 --> 00:55:30.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:33.029 --> 00:55:33.039 align:start position:0%
okay um representative ger can I just
 
00:55:35.230 --> 00:55:35.240 align:start position:0%
make a comment on that yeah I think it's
 
00:55:37.349 --> 00:55:37.359 align:start position:0%
problematic and the reason is that they
 
00:55:39.910 --> 00:55:39.920 align:start position:0%
have electrical corporations and they
 
00:55:41.710 --> 00:55:41.720 align:start position:0%
have felt very strongly about wanting to
 
00:55:44.150 --> 00:55:44.160 align:start position:0%
keep that license and the reason for
 
00:55:45.829 --> 00:55:45.839 align:start position:0%
that is to allow people who are not
 
00:55:48.230 --> 00:55:48.240 align:start position:0%
master electricians uh to essentially
 
00:55:50.309 --> 00:55:50.319 align:start position:0%
own a corporation employ a bunch of
 
00:55:52.630 --> 00:55:52.640 align:start position:0%
people which may include a master and a
 
00:55:54.430 --> 00:55:54.440 align:start position:0%
journeyman the master supervises the
 
00:55:56.470 --> 00:55:56.480 align:start position:0%
journeyman but the master is not the
 
00:55:59.309 --> 00:55:59.319 align:start position:0%
employer so there's a conflict in the
 
00:56:01.510 --> 00:56:01.520 align:start position:0%
law there and I think that that's why it
 
00:56:03.510 --> 00:56:03.520 align:start position:0%
needs to be repealed in order to allow
 
00:56:07.710 --> 00:56:07.720 align:start position:0%
them to have that uh that uh fun
 
00:56:11.829 --> 00:56:11.839 align:start position:0%
function with respect to the electrical
 
00:56:13.549 --> 00:56:13.559 align:start position:0%
corporations I think that this is
 
00:56:15.109 --> 00:56:15.119 align:start position:0%
something that we need to Noodle out I
 
00:56:16.670 --> 00:56:16.680 align:start position:0%
know what you're saying I understand the
 
00:56:19.109 --> 00:56:19.119 align:start position:0%
board's concerned too so I don't know if
 
00:56:22.430 --> 00:56:22.440 align:start position:0%
we should say journeyman shall report to
 
00:56:25.230 --> 00:56:25.240 align:start position:0%
the master electrician in some other you
 
00:56:27.390 --> 00:56:27.400 align:start position:0%
know I I know what you're well this is
 
00:56:28.789 --> 00:56:28.799 align:start position:0%
we'll have to we'll have to talk about
 
00:56:30.430 --> 00:56:30.440 align:start position:0%
this okay I'm just raising the conflict
 
00:56:32.829 --> 00:56:32.839 align:start position:0%
in the law I understand I understand
 
00:56:32.839 --> 00:56:33.870 align:start position:0%
in the law I understand I understand
sorry

00:56:33.870 --> 00:56:33.880 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
00:56:35.990 --> 00:56:36.000 align:start position:0%
sorry but I also understand what the
 
00:56:38.109 --> 00:56:38.119 align:start position:0%
electricians care about which is you
 
00:56:40.549 --> 00:56:40.559 align:start position:0%
know okay is that the only comment on
 
00:56:44.029 --> 00:56:44.039 align:start position:0%
the from the electricians no okay um on
 
00:56:45.549 --> 00:56:45.559 align:start position:0%
the next
 
00:56:49.109 --> 00:56:49.119 align:start position:0%
page it's is it 319
 
00:56:52.870 --> 00:56:52.880 align:start position:0%
C6 we're going to keep that no it's in
 
00:56:56.870 --> 00:56:56.880 align:start position:0%
uh the section above 3195 a
 
00:57:00.870 --> 00:57:00.880 align:start position:0%
319 five there's a sentence uh
 
00:57:02.670 --> 00:57:02.680 align:start position:0%
eliminated the board shall maintain and
 
00:57:04.390 --> 00:57:04.400 align:start position:0%
make available a list of such persons
 
00:57:05.829 --> 00:57:05.839 align:start position:0%
approved for level one or level two
 
00:57:08.069 --> 00:57:08.079 align:start position:0%
thirdparty electrical inspections the
 
00:57:10.309 --> 00:57:10.319 align:start position:0%
board believes that this list uh being
 
00:57:12.950 --> 00:57:12.960 align:start position:0%
made available is important uh so you
 
00:57:15.230 --> 00:57:15.240 align:start position:0%
could change it from board to office the
 
00:57:17.270 --> 00:57:17.280 align:start position:0%
office shall maintain and make available
 
00:57:19.510 --> 00:57:19.520 align:start position:0%
a list of such
 
00:57:19.520 --> 00:57:22.230 align:start position:0%
a list of such
persons

00:57:22.230 --> 00:57:22.240 align:start position:0%
persons
 
00:57:24.390 --> 00:57:24.400 align:start position:0%
okay and then just one more when you're
 
00:57:24.400 --> 00:57:26.470 align:start position:0%
okay and then just one more when you're
ready

00:57:26.470 --> 00:57:26.480 align:start position:0%
ready
 
00:57:30.029 --> 00:57:30.039 align:start position:0%
okay hang on a second
 
00:57:33.950 --> 00:57:33.960 align:start position:0%
um all right go ahead so you said uh 319
 
00:57:37.349 --> 00:57:37.359 align:start position:0%
C6 C is staying fail we're not we're
 
00:57:38.829 --> 00:57:38.839 align:start position:0%
going to keep failure to complete the
 
00:57:40.829 --> 00:57:40.839 align:start position:0%
continuing education shall render the
 
00:57:43.910 --> 00:57:43.920 align:start position:0%
electrician's license invalid until leny
 
00:57:45.230 --> 00:57:45.240 align:start position:0%
demonstrates the board that he or she
 
00:57:46.750 --> 00:57:46.760 align:start position:0%
has completed the requirement so we're
 
00:57:49.789 --> 00:57:49.799 align:start position:0%
going to leave that okay okay and then
 
00:57:52.670 --> 00:57:52.680 align:start position:0%
it says proof of completion shall be
 
00:57:55.109 --> 00:57:55.119 align:start position:0%
sorry proof of completion shall be turns
 
00:57:57.390 --> 00:57:57.400 align:start position:0%
by the board by the continuing education
 
00:58:00.510 --> 00:58:00.520 align:start position:0%
provider I I do believe and and the
 
00:58:04.029 --> 00:58:04.039 align:start position:0%
board um agrees that under to remove the
 
00:58:05.230 --> 00:58:05.240 align:start position:0%
conflict it should be proof of
 
00:58:07.630 --> 00:58:07.640 align:start position:0%
completion shall be furnished to the
 
00:58:12.710 --> 00:58:12.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:17.349 --> 00:58:17.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:23.710 --> 00:58:23.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:26.829 --> 00:58:26.839 align:start position:0%
raised it's it's okay to change Board
 
00:58:28.750 --> 00:58:28.760 align:start position:0%
office but it's still saying continue
 
00:58:31.670 --> 00:58:31.680 align:start position:0%
Prov Chang because the way it's written
 
00:58:34.230 --> 00:58:34.240 align:start position:0%
is I believe now we're supposed to subm
 
00:58:36.349 --> 00:58:36.359 align:start position:0%
Mr you need to speak into the microphone
 
00:58:37.990 --> 00:58:38.000 align:start position:0%
because you're being this is a bit
 
00:58:39.750 --> 00:58:39.760 align:start position:0%
public meeting Steve ran LIC electrician
 
00:58:42.029 --> 00:58:42.039 align:start position:0%
I apologize so I just want to make sure
 
00:58:43.710 --> 00:58:43.720 align:start position:0%
that it doesn't still say by the
 
00:58:44.870 --> 00:58:44.880 align:start position:0%
provider because I don't think they have
 
00:58:46.990 --> 00:58:47.000 align:start position:0%
a process to take that by the provider I
 
00:58:48.510 --> 00:58:48.520 align:start position:0%
believe some of the Law changes or rule
 
00:58:51.710 --> 00:58:51.720 align:start position:0%
changes we're making the electrician
 
00:58:53.390 --> 00:58:53.400 align:start position:0%
submit it now so we just want to make
 
00:58:54.710 --> 00:58:54.720 align:start position:0%
sure that's clear is it still going to
 
00:58:56.670 --> 00:58:56.680 align:start position:0%
going to be by the provider or is it
 
00:58:59.470 --> 00:58:59.480 align:start position:0%
going to be by the lensey that is
 
00:59:01.510 --> 00:59:01.520 align:start position:0%
submitted that's
 
00:59:04.470 --> 00:59:04.480 align:start position:0%
all okay we had a third party software
 
00:59:08.950 --> 00:59:08.960 align:start position:0%
have provider C Circus Circus circled so
 
00:59:11.870 --> 00:59:11.880 align:start position:0%
I'll um license see I'll make myself a
 
00:59:13.710 --> 00:59:13.720 align:start position:0%
note and we'll check it out thank you
 
00:59:13.720 --> 00:59:16.950 align:start position:0%
note and we'll check it out thank you
for

00:59:16.950 --> 00:59:16.960 align:start position:0%

that okay you can come you can come back
 
00:59:23.470 --> 00:59:23.480 align:start position:0%
so are we done with electricians now

mediators that is staying right we
 
00:59:37.589 --> 00:59:37.599 align:start position:0%
didn't make that
 
00:59:40.150 --> 00:59:40.160 align:start position:0%
advisory so is there someone that is
 
00:59:43.829 --> 00:59:43.839 align:start position:0%
going to go through that and make sure
 
00:59:49.829 --> 00:59:49.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:49.839 --> 00:59:53.630 align:start position:0%
 
2:30

00:59:53.630 --> 00:59:53.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:53.640 --> 01:00:00.710 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:00:00.710 --> 01:00:00.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:05.789 --> 01:00:05.799 align:start position:0%

sure so there's supposed to be another
 
01:00:21.670 --> 01:00:21.680 align:start position:0%
subcommunity meeting at 10:30 in this
 
01:00:25.150 --> 01:00:25.160 align:start position:0%
room but is going to happen after this
 
01:00:28.069 --> 01:00:28.079 align:start position:0%
because we're going to keep going on
 
01:00:32.190 --> 01:00:32.200 align:start position:0%
this we're almost done done there um
 
01:00:36.910 --> 01:00:36.920 align:start position:0%
section um 234 uh
 
01:00:36.920 --> 01:00:40.150 align:start position:0%
section um 234 uh
Foresters

01:00:40.150 --> 01:00:40.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:43.670 --> 01:00:43.680 align:start position:0%
um I believe um I'm sorry I'm reading
 
01:00:48.710 --> 01:00:48.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:51.230 --> 01:00:51.240 align:start position:0%
one I think there was some uh
 
01:00:54.069 --> 01:00:54.079 align:start position:0%
legislation pending on this one um this
 
01:00:55.710 --> 01:00:55.720 align:start position:0%
is our other board counsel right we're
 
01:00:57.470 --> 01:00:57.480 align:start position:0%
not going to do anything with them we're
 
01:00:59.710 --> 01:00:59.720 align:start position:0%
going to leave them alone okay so does
 
01:01:01.510 --> 01:01:01.520 align:start position:0%
that mean that this has to test to
 
01:01:05.150 --> 01:01:05.160 align:start position:0%
change um no I believe this should be
 
01:01:05.160 --> 01:01:06.589 align:start position:0%
change um no I believe this should be
fine

01:01:06.589 --> 01:01:06.599 align:start position:0%
fine
 
01:01:09.910 --> 01:01:09.920 align:start position:0%
okay you've got until Friday to tell me
 
01:01:11.789 --> 01:01:11.799 align:start position:0%
it isn't
 
01:01:15.349 --> 01:01:15.359 align:start position:0%
okay um so we're going to skip Foresters
 
01:01:17.309 --> 01:01:17.319 align:start position:0%
and then we're going

01:03:07.029 --> 01:03:07.039 align:start position:0%
um did this legislation conflict now
 
01:03:10.349 --> 01:03:10.359 align:start position:0%
because this was tentatively to be an
 
01:03:12.190 --> 01:03:12.200 align:start position:0%
Advisory board but it's not going to be
 
01:03:12.200 --> 01:03:13.670 align:start position:0%
Advisory board but it's not going to be
now

01:03:13.670 --> 01:03:13.680 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:03:16.069 --> 01:03:16.079 align:start position:0%

01:03:16.079 --> 01:03:18.069 align:start position:0%
so do you want to take a look at it
separately

01:03:18.069 --> 01:03:18.079 align:start position:0%
separately
 
01:03:21.589 --> 01:03:21.599 align:start position:0%

01:03:55.670 --> 01:03:55.680 align:start position:0%
to make an form decision on whether or
 
01:03:58.109 --> 01:03:58.119 align:start position:0%
not to appoint an individual as guardian
 
01:04:02.510 --> 01:04:02.520 align:start position:0%
at lium in in a particular case um I
 
01:04:04.630 --> 01:04:04.640 align:start position:0%
don't know that that is necessarily a
 
01:04:07.589 --> 01:04:07.599 align:start position:0%
board function so much as an office
 
01:04:11.269 --> 01:04:11.279 align:start position:0%
function um as it pertains to uh
 
01:04:13.109 --> 01:04:13.119 align:start position:0%
receiving information about applications
 
01:04:15.430 --> 01:04:15.440 align:start position:0%
and applicants
 
01:04:18.150 --> 01:04:18.160 align:start position:0%
okay I'll check with the office on that
 
01:04:22.069 --> 01:04:22.079 align:start position:0%
sure and a similar comment to the new f
 
01:04:26.390 --> 01:04:26.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:32.230 --> 01:04:32.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:35.390 --> 01:04:35.400 align:start position:0%
okay any other questions on Guardian
 
01:04:41.470 --> 01:04:41.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:46.589 --> 01:04:46.599 align:start position:0%
for um so for uh section 245 under the
 
01:04:50.910 --> 01:04:50.920 align:start position:0%
repeals of Roman numeral 2 there was a
 
01:04:56.829 --> 01:04:56.839 align:start position:0%
question um regarding whether or not um
 
01:05:00.309 --> 01:05:00.319 align:start position:0%
if this would be replaced with anything
 
01:05:03.069 --> 01:05:03.079 align:start position:0%
um it's 490
 
01:05:09.230 --> 01:05:09.240 align:start position:0%
C five Roman numeral 2 e um relative to
 
01:05:17.870 --> 01:05:17.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:19.870 --> 01:05:19.880 align:start position:0%
resignation I think we need to look at
 
01:05:22.910 --> 01:05:22.920 align:start position:0%
this section in more detail okay so
 
01:05:24.829 --> 01:05:24.839 align:start position:0%

01:05:29.589 --> 01:05:29.599 align:start position:0%
um can I yes
 
01:05:32.190 --> 01:05:32.200 align:start position:0%
um do you think we should postpone the
 
01:05:35.230 --> 01:05:35.240 align:start position:0%
meeting on 1622 because this is looks
 
01:05:37.589 --> 01:05:37.599 align:start position:0%
like it's going to take a while well I
 
01:05:40.029 --> 01:05:40.039 align:start position:0%

01:06:19.430 --> 01:06:19.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:23.029 --> 01:06:23.039 align:start position:0%
geologists um uh just a grammatical
 
01:06:23.039 --> 01:06:26.510 align:start position:0%

after the
 
01:06:44.390 --> 01:06:44.400 align:start position:0%
semicolon and I believe it was it was
 
01:06:47.630 --> 01:06:47.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:47.640 --> 01:06:51.309 align:start position:0%
 
I

01:06:51.309 --> 01:06:51.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:51.319 --> 01:06:52.990 align:start position:0%

um by presenting evidence satisfactory
 
01:07:26.390 --> 01:07:26.400 align:start position:0%
to the board should be to the office uh
 
01:07:28.269 --> 01:07:28.279 align:start position:0%

um presenting uh
 
01:07:35.069 --> 01:07:35.079 align:start position:0%

01:08:07.109 --> 01:08:07.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:12.910 --> 01:08:12.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:16.229 --> 01:08:16.239 align:start position:0%
inspectors um I
 
01:08:18.390 --> 01:08:18.400 align:start position:0%
believe want to get the section number
 
01:08:18.400 --> 01:08:19.430 align:start position:0%
believe want to get the section number
for

01:08:19.430 --> 01:08:19.440 align:start position:0%

01:08:31.630 --> 01:08:31.640 align:start position:0%
four um the board shall have the
 
01:08:33.430 --> 01:08:33.440 align:start position:0%
discretion to reject they believe that
 
01:08:36.470 --> 01:08:36.480 align:start position:0%
should be that power is vested with the
 
01:08:40.030 --> 01:08:40.040 align:start position:0%
office um to it should change to the
 
01:08:42.030 --> 01:08:42.040 align:start position:0%
office shall have a discretion to reject
 
01:08:48.749 --> 01:08:48.759 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:51.990 --> 01:08:52.000 align:start position:0%
okay um section
 
01:08:54.709 --> 01:08:54.719 align:start position:0%
257 um
 
01:08:57.470 --> 01:08:57.480 align:start position:0%
I believe again uh there's board
 
01:08:57.480 --> 01:08:58.829 align:start position:0%
I believe again uh there's board
approved

01:08:58.829 --> 01:08:58.839 align:start position:0%
approved
 
01:09:01.829 --> 01:09:01.839 align:start position:0%
course um I believe it's uh courses
 
01:09:05.590 --> 01:09:05.600 align:start position:0%
approved by the office
 
01:09:08.590 --> 01:09:08.600 align:start position:0%
um are you talking about line
 
01:09:11.950 --> 01:09:11.960 align:start position:0%
15 um I believe it starts on 14 and
 
01:09:16.789 --> 01:09:16.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:19.590 --> 01:09:19.600 align:start position:0%
says continuing education completion in
 
01:09:21.309 --> 01:09:21.319 align:start position:0%
each two-year renewal period of a
 
01:09:24.189 --> 01:09:24.199 align:start position:0%
minimum of 20 hours of continuing educ a
 
01:09:26.390 --> 01:09:26.400 align:start position:0%
shall be required for license rural
 
01:09:28.189 --> 01:09:28.199 align:start position:0%
provided that one hour of the 20
 
01:09:30.550 --> 01:09:30.560 align:start position:0%
required hours shall be from a board
 
01:09:33.070 --> 01:09:33.080 align:start position:0%
approved course on appropriate building
 
01:09:33.080 --> 01:09:34.709 align:start position:0%
approved course on appropriate building
regulations

01:09:34.709 --> 01:09:34.719 align:start position:0%
regulations
 
01:09:37.870 --> 01:09:37.880 align:start position:0%
including uh any recent revisions to
 
01:09:40.430 --> 01:09:40.440 align:start position:0%
regulations and I believe the office
 
01:09:43.590 --> 01:09:43.600 align:start position:0%
would be approving yes those courses so
 
01:09:46.110 --> 01:09:46.120 align:start position:0%
would be an office approved course with
 
01:09:48.870 --> 01:09:48.880 align:start position:0%
criteria right I have the
 
01:09:52.709 --> 01:09:52.719 align:start position:0%
office um based with off sorry the the
 
01:09:56.550 --> 01:09:56.560 align:start position:0%
office using board criteria shall
 
01:10:00.189 --> 01:10:00.199 align:start position:0%
approve education courses yes okay
 
01:10:05.270 --> 01:10:05.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:05.280 --> 01:10:07.510 align:start position:0%
 
right

01:10:07.510 --> 01:10:07.520 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:10:10.550 --> 01:10:10.560 align:start position:0%
yeah why is the office approving them
 
01:10:11.830 --> 01:10:11.840 align:start position:0%
and not the
 
01:10:14.669 --> 01:10:14.679 align:start position:0%
board I think the board should have the
 
01:10:16.669 --> 01:10:16.679 align:start position:0%
say we're getting a little too far out
 
01:10:20.590 --> 01:10:20.600 align:start position:0%
of what the intent of the office was
 
01:10:22.630 --> 01:10:22.640 align:start position:0%
when it was
 
01:10:22.640 --> 01:10:24.510 align:start position:0%
when it was
created

01:10:24.510 --> 01:10:24.520 align:start position:0%
created
 
01:10:26.709 --> 01:10:26.719 align:start position:0%
boards are supposed to still
 
01:10:30.070 --> 01:10:30.080 align:start position:0%
remain on their own in the functions of
 
01:10:33.149 --> 01:10:33.159 align:start position:0%
what the criteria are for
 
01:10:35.350 --> 01:10:35.360 align:start position:0%
licensing while the board while the
 
01:10:37.030 --> 01:10:37.040 align:start position:0%
office itself can
 
01:10:41.030 --> 01:10:41.040 align:start position:0%
handle the functions I still think it's
 
01:10:43.189 --> 01:10:43.199 align:start position:0%
the board who should be
 
01:10:43.199 --> 01:10:45.229 align:start position:0%
the board who should be
approving

01:10:45.229 --> 01:10:45.239 align:start position:0%
approving
 
01:10:48.830 --> 01:10:48.840 align:start position:0%
what is required for the licensing they
 
01:10:50.550 --> 01:10:50.560 align:start position:0%
have the expertise they have the
 
01:10:52.709 --> 01:10:52.719 align:start position:0%
knowledge they're the ones in the field
 
01:10:54.430 --> 01:10:54.440 align:start position:0%
and I think we're taking that away from
 
01:10:56.110 --> 01:10:56.120 align:start position:0%
them with some of this language are
 
01:10:57.950 --> 01:10:57.960 align:start position:0%
changing in here and I have an issue
 
01:11:00.470 --> 01:11:00.480 align:start position:0%
with that and I know I'm not part of the
 
01:11:02.950 --> 01:11:02.960 align:start position:0%
subcommittee man chair but no you I just
 
01:11:05.830 --> 01:11:05.840 align:start position:0%
want to State my concerns over as we're
 
01:11:07.229 --> 01:11:07.239 align:start position:0%
going through this and that's why I'm
 
01:11:10.990 --> 01:11:11.000 align:start position:0%
here right well the issue with uh then
 
01:11:13.430 --> 01:11:13.440 align:start position:0%
we have to have a whole philosophical
 
01:11:14.910 --> 01:11:14.920 align:start position:0%
discussion on that because this is
 
01:11:16.229 --> 01:11:16.239 align:start position:0%
consistent with everything else that
 
01:11:16.239 --> 01:11:19.470 align:start position:0%
consistent with everything else that
we've

01:11:19.470 --> 01:11:19.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:22.790 --> 01:11:22.800 align:start position:0%
done and I guess it's something that we
 
01:11:24.550 --> 01:11:24.560 align:start position:0%
need to talk about it is because I think
 
01:11:25.830 --> 01:11:25.840 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt was here from in
 
01:11:28.470 --> 01:11:28.480 align:start position:0%
the beginning when oplc was given what
 
01:11:30.470 --> 01:11:30.480 align:start position:0%
they were and it was this wasn't the
 
01:11:32.270 --> 01:11:32.280 align:start position:0%
intent as far as we're going here from
 
01:11:37.430 --> 01:11:37.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:37.440 --> 01:11:39.270 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:11:39.270 --> 01:11:39.280 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:11:41.510 --> 01:11:41.520 align:start position:0%
yes thank you madam chair and thank you
 
01:11:44.149 --> 01:11:44.159 align:start position:0%
representative Goldie for your remarks
 
01:11:48.950 --> 01:11:48.960 align:start position:0%
uh I I se absolutely second that and the
 
01:11:52.270 --> 01:11:52.280 align:start position:0%
intent was always that the oplc was
 
01:11:55.310 --> 01:11:55.320 align:start position:0%
going to be the admin administrative
 
01:11:58.430 --> 01:11:58.440 align:start position:0%
underpinning of the operation but the
 
01:12:01.830 --> 01:12:01.840 align:start position:0%
substance of the board's expertise which
 
01:12:04.709 --> 01:12:04.719 align:start position:0%
is the professional the scope of
 
01:12:07.709 --> 01:12:07.719 align:start position:0%
practice all aspects in relating to the
 
01:12:10.149 --> 01:12:10.159 align:start position:0%
profession itself that was going to
 
01:12:12.270 --> 01:12:12.280 align:start position:0%
remain the board and it was never Our
 
01:12:14.470 --> 01:12:14.480 align:start position:0%
intention and we've discussed this for
 
01:12:16.990 --> 01:12:17.000 align:start position:0%
years that we we were afraid that the
 
01:12:19.550 --> 01:12:19.560 align:start position:0%
oplc was being given the executive
 
01:12:22.750 --> 01:12:22.760 align:start position:0%
director was being given authority to to
 
01:12:27.229 --> 01:12:27.239 align:start position:0%
exercise oversight and control of the
 
01:12:29.149 --> 01:12:29.159 align:start position:0%
substance of the
 
01:12:32.470 --> 01:12:32.480 align:start position:0%
profession was never intended to do that
 
01:12:34.950 --> 01:12:34.960 align:start position:0%
and it and and we didn't and the senior
 
01:12:36.590 --> 01:12:36.600 align:start position:0%
members of the committee who had seen
 
01:12:39.470 --> 01:12:39.480 align:start position:0%
this whole Evolution we never wanted
 
01:12:42.110 --> 01:12:42.120 align:start position:0%
that and we've been discussing that
 
01:12:44.709 --> 01:12:44.719 align:start position:0%
amongst ourselves for years that we did
 
01:12:48.709 --> 01:12:48.719 align:start position:0%
not want to have that lost sight of so I
 
01:12:50.430 --> 01:12:50.440 align:start position:0%
I absolutely second what representative
 
01:12:52.750 --> 01:12:52.760 align:start position:0%
goalie is saying and I believe that you
 
01:12:52.760 --> 01:12:54.910 align:start position:0%
goalie is saying and I believe that you
were

01:12:54.910 --> 01:12:54.920 align:start position:0%
were
 
01:12:57.430 --> 01:12:57.440 align:start position:0%
acknowledging that that is a discussion
 
01:13:00.110 --> 01:13:00.120 align:start position:0%
that we on the committee need to have
 
01:13:02.790 --> 01:13:02.800 align:start position:0%
and that was one of the reasons that we
 
01:13:07.110 --> 01:13:07.120 align:start position:0%
voted inim study on 1676 if you recall
 
01:13:09.070 --> 01:13:09.080 align:start position:0%
because we wanted to use that as a
 
01:13:11.950 --> 01:13:11.960 align:start position:0%
vehicle to to accomplish this purpose of
 
01:13:11.960 --> 01:13:13.229 align:start position:0%
vehicle to to accomplish this purpose of
getting

01:13:13.229 --> 01:13:13.239 align:start position:0%
getting
 
01:13:16.550 --> 01:13:16.560 align:start position:0%
oplc focused on on the administrative
 
01:13:21.790 --> 01:13:21.800 align:start position:0%
end of things um and U and so I I wholly
 
01:13:25.110 --> 01:13:25.120 align:start position:0%
support what represented has just said
 
01:13:27.350 --> 01:13:27.360 align:start position:0%
okay well that said I don't want to be
 
01:13:29.790 --> 01:13:29.800 align:start position:0%
seem like I'm I'm callous about this but
 
01:13:31.790 --> 01:13:31.800 align:start position:0%
at the same time I'm we're I'm printing
 
01:13:33.350 --> 01:13:33.360 align:start position:0%
under a deadline and we're going to get
 
01:13:36.189 --> 01:13:36.199 align:start position:0%
this bloody thing done so we're on Manu
 
01:13:37.350 --> 01:13:37.360 align:start position:0%
and we're going to talk about it
 
01:13:38.629 --> 01:13:38.639 align:start position:0%
separately because that's a whole
 
01:13:40.189 --> 01:13:40.199 align:start position:0%
different that's a whole different
 
01:13:42.830 --> 01:13:42.840 align:start position:0%
philosophy than what we talked about in
 
01:13:45.709 --> 01:13:45.719 align:start position:0%
this committee and I understand the um
 
01:13:47.430 --> 01:13:47.440 align:start position:0%
the discussion and although it's nice
 
01:13:49.030 --> 01:13:49.040 align:start position:0%
that the senior members were talking
 
01:13:52.149 --> 01:13:52.159 align:start position:0%
about this together you know now that
 
01:13:55.350 --> 01:13:55.360 align:start position:0%
it's here we need to discuss it publicly
 
01:13:58.030 --> 01:13:58.040 align:start position:0%
and we aren't going to do that today um
 
01:13:59.669 --> 01:13:59.679 align:start position:0%
manufactured housing I think we're
 
01:14:01.629 --> 01:14:01.639 align:start position:0%
taking this out
 
01:14:11.750 --> 01:14:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:18.709 --> 01:14:18.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:21.270 --> 01:14:21.280 align:start position:0%
surveyors um I think the there's a
 
01:14:24.229 --> 01:14:24.239 align:start position:0%
question um under Section
 
01:14:24.239 --> 01:14:25.790 align:start position:0%
question um under Section
uh

01:14:25.790 --> 01:14:25.800 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:14:29.629 --> 01:14:29.639 align:start position:0%
273 Roman numeral 3 that's been struck
 
01:14:33.910 --> 01:14:33.920 align:start position:0%
if the uh land surveyor and training um
 
01:14:37.149 --> 01:14:37.159 align:start position:0%
is being removed is that your comment
 
01:14:48.390 --> 01:14:48.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:50.470 --> 01:14:50.480 align:start position:0%
comment it was all
 
01:14:50.480 --> 01:14:52.270 align:start position:0%
comment it was all
removed

01:14:52.270 --> 01:14:52.280 align:start position:0%
removed
 
01:14:52.280 --> 01:14:55.229 align:start position:0%
removed
yeah

01:14:55.229 --> 01:14:55.239 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:14:56.750 --> 01:14:56.760 align:start position:0%
okay so they're concerned about land
 
01:15:00.110 --> 01:15:00.120 align:start position:0%
surveyor and training correct being
 
01:15:03.030 --> 01:15:03.040 align:start position:0%
struck that's correct the comment I
 
01:15:10.229 --> 01:15:10.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:13.750 --> 01:15:13.760 align:start position:0%
right um I
 
01:15:16.669 --> 01:15:16.679 align:start position:0%
will I'll recognize that
 
01:15:19.870 --> 01:15:19.880 align:start position:0%
concern um and and then if that is a
 
01:15:22.030 --> 01:15:22.040 align:start position:0%
case that it is
 
01:15:24.510 --> 01:15:24.520 align:start position:0%
removed uh
 
01:15:24.520 --> 01:15:26.350 align:start position:0%
removed uh
then

01:15:26.350 --> 01:15:26.360 align:start position:0%
then
 
01:15:35.270 --> 01:15:35.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:37.669 --> 01:15:37.679 align:start position:0%
likely I
 
01:15:43.229 --> 01:15:43.239 align:start position:0%
apologize section 274 Roman numeral
 
01:15:47.390 --> 01:15:47.400 align:start position:0%
2B if the land surveyor in training is
 
01:15:47.400 --> 01:15:48.550 align:start position:0%
2B if the land surveyor in training is
being

01:15:48.550 --> 01:15:48.560 align:start position:0%
being
 
01:15:52.310 --> 01:15:52.320 align:start position:0%
eliminated um then that that reference
 
01:15:55.629 --> 01:15:55.639 align:start position:0%
in that section would just need to be
 
01:15:58.030 --> 01:15:58.040 align:start position:0%
removed right or we're going to keep it
 
01:15:59.790 --> 01:15:59.800 align:start position:0%
in if we keep the land surveyor in
 
01:16:01.390 --> 01:16:01.400 align:start position:0%
correct okay
 
01:16:06.669 --> 01:16:06.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:12.910 --> 01:16:12.920 align:start position:0%

01:16:21.350 --> 01:16:21.360 align:start position:0%
um the language in the opinion of the
 
01:16:23.709 --> 01:16:23.719 align:start position:0%
board um
 
01:16:26.430 --> 01:16:26.440 align:start position:0%
this appears to contemplate that the
 
01:16:28.990 --> 01:16:29.000 align:start position:0%
boore would be reviewing the
 
01:16:31.229 --> 01:16:31.239 align:start position:0%
license uh
 
01:16:35.430 --> 01:16:35.440 align:start position:0%
however it's it the uh licensing goes
 
01:16:37.270 --> 01:16:37.280 align:start position:0%
through the
 
01:16:40.790 --> 01:16:40.800 align:start position:0%

into uh three parts those that uh think
 
01:30:06.590 --> 01:30:06.600 align:start position:0%
we uh we think are most important uh
 
01:30:09.629 --> 01:30:09.639 align:start position:0%
that would improve oiless rules function
 
01:30:12.990 --> 01:30:13.000 align:start position:0%
those that uh we believe four five and
 
01:30:14.830 --> 01:30:14.840 align:start position:0%
11 are housekeeping
 
01:30:18.109 --> 01:30:18.119 align:start position:0%
amendments uh improving ORS rules
 
01:30:22.950 --> 01:30:22.960 align:start position:0%
function was sections 3 9 10 and
 
01:30:28.870 --> 01:30:28.880 align:start position:0%
12 um sections 1 two 4 and 6 through 8
 
01:30:31.910 --> 01:30:31.920 align:start position:0%
um we're not taking a position on
 
01:30:33.990 --> 01:30:34.000 align:start position:0%
whether the committee retains those
 
01:30:37.870 --> 01:30:37.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:37.880 --> 01:30:40.149 align:start position:0%
 
not

01:30:40.149 --> 01:30:40.159 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:30:44.470 --> 01:30:44.480 align:start position:0%
go okay so um I guess I'll start with um
 
01:30:46.430 --> 01:30:46.440 align:start position:0%
looking at our memo here that we sent a
 
01:30:50.149 --> 01:30:50.159 align:start position:0%
couple of days ago um so section three
 
01:30:52.270 --> 01:30:52.280 align:start position:0%
um the amendments there um we're
 
01:30:54.550 --> 01:30:54.560 align:start position:0%
proposing those because they would

a151

01:31:00.310 --> 01:31:00.320 align:start position:0%
a151
 
01:31:03.510 --> 01:31:03.520 align:start position:0%
um I hope that the uh the bullet points
 
01:31:06.350 --> 01:31:06.360 align:start position:0%
there or the numbering there those those
 
01:31:09.590 --> 01:31:09.600 align:start position:0%
areas kind of explain what we're doing
 
01:31:12.270 --> 01:31:12.280 align:start position:0%
currently the agency files an adopted
 
01:31:15.109 --> 01:31:15.119 align:start position:0%
rule then we edit and create revision
 
01:31:17.350 --> 01:31:17.360 align:start position:0%
and Source notes and then that draft
 
01:31:19.910 --> 01:31:19.920 align:start position:0%
rule draft certified rule is s over to
 
01:31:23.189 --> 01:31:23.199 align:start position:0%
the agency and the agency has 121 days
 
01:31:27.189 --> 01:31:27.199 align:start position:0%
to respond and then after um that 121
 
01:31:31.109 --> 01:31:31.119 align:start position:0%
days um OS then works with the agency
 
01:31:33.430 --> 01:31:33.440 align:start position:0%
and gets that certified rule up on the
 
01:31:35.990 --> 01:31:36.000 align:start position:0%
website the problem is is that although
 
01:31:38.149 --> 01:31:38.159 align:start position:0%
agencies have a statutory deadline of
 
01:31:40.910 --> 01:31:40.920 align:start position:0%
120 days to respond and to certify their
 
01:31:43.990 --> 01:31:44.000 align:start position:0%
rules that isn't being met and because
 
01:31:45.390 --> 01:31:45.400 align:start position:0%
sometimes they're taking more than six
 
01:31:48.030 --> 01:31:48.040 align:start position:0%
months to certify the rules then that
 
01:31:50.750 --> 01:31:50.760 align:start position:0%
means that um what's currently posted on
 
01:31:53.709 --> 01:31:53.719 align:start position:0%
our website is not not an accurate um
 
01:31:56.350 --> 01:31:56.360 align:start position:0%
it's not an accurate rule in some cases
 
01:31:58.030 --> 01:31:58.040 align:start position:0%
so even though the rule has been you
 
01:32:01.310 --> 01:32:01.320 align:start position:0%
know um approved and has been adopted
 
01:32:04.189 --> 01:32:04.199 align:start position:0%
and is effective what's on our website
 
01:32:07.030 --> 01:32:07.040 align:start position:0%
um could be old it could be you know a
 
01:32:10.669 --> 01:32:10.679 align:start position:0%
year old or more so um if you look in
 
01:32:12.149 --> 01:32:12.159 align:start position:0%
the second part there the future
 
01:32:15.390 --> 01:32:15.400 align:start position:0%
certification that kind of describes our
 
01:32:17.910 --> 01:32:17.920 align:start position:0%
amendments so first the agency would
 
01:32:20.070 --> 01:32:20.080 align:start position:0%
file an adopted rule with us then we
 
01:32:24.350 --> 01:32:24.360 align:start position:0%
would post that as f rule on our website
 
01:32:27.229 --> 01:32:27.239 align:start position:0%
under the appropriate agency then we
 
01:32:29.510 --> 01:32:29.520 align:start position:0%
would take time to edit create the
 
01:32:31.550 --> 01:32:31.560 align:start position:0%
revision notes and update the source
 
01:32:34.550 --> 01:32:34.560 align:start position:0%
notes and then that draft certified rule
 
01:32:36.510 --> 01:32:36.520 align:start position:0%
would be sent to the agency and we would
 
01:32:39.990 --> 01:32:40.000 align:start position:0%
give them 60 days to let us know whether
 
01:32:41.990 --> 01:32:42.000 align:start position:0%
or not that looks right if there are any
 
01:32:44.550 --> 01:32:44.560 align:start position:0%
changes but um the important piece is if
 
01:32:46.990 --> 01:32:47.000 align:start position:0%
you look at number six is that after 60
 
01:32:49.550 --> 01:32:49.560 align:start position:0%
days with or without a response from the
 
01:32:52.270 --> 01:32:52.280 align:start position:0%
agency the rule would be certified and
 
01:32:53.910 --> 01:32:53.920 align:start position:0%
that way we could go ahead and get it up
 
01:32:57.910 --> 01:32:57.920 align:start position:0%
on our website so that um describes
 
01:33:00.709 --> 01:33:00.719 align:start position:0%
essentially what we're doing and uh I
 
01:33:02.990 --> 01:33:03.000 align:start position:0%
know there was some concern that uh it
 
01:33:04.510 --> 01:33:04.520 align:start position:0%
looked like there were just semantic
 
01:33:07.709 --> 01:33:07.719 align:start position:0%
changes to the statute but they're not
 
01:33:09.990 --> 01:33:10.000 align:start position:0%
so they would help us um get those rules
 
01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:11.430 align:start position:0%
so they would help us um get those rules
posted

01:33:11.430 --> 01:33:11.440 align:start position:0%
posted
 
01:33:14.149 --> 01:33:14.159 align:start position:0%
earlier representative Maguire did you
 
01:33:16.990 --> 01:33:17.000 align:start position:0%
have a question I have a question yes do
 
01:33:19.629 --> 01:33:19.639 align:start position:0%
I understand it correctly that right now
 
01:33:23.070 --> 01:33:23.080 align:start position:0%
you have no time limit at all
 
01:33:25.790 --> 01:33:25.800 align:start position:0%
no that's not correct um there is a time
 
01:33:28.189 --> 01:33:28.199 align:start position:0%
limit like I said the statute says
 
01:33:30.350 --> 01:33:30.360 align:start position:0%
there's 121 days for the agency to
 
01:33:33.350 --> 01:33:33.360 align:start position:0%
certify those rules no no this is for
 
01:33:37.030 --> 01:33:37.040 align:start position:0%
you to if I read it correctly you edit
 
01:33:40.750 --> 01:33:40.760 align:start position:0%
the rule and so forth yeah and in this
 
01:33:43.590 --> 01:33:43.600 align:start position:0%
case it this the the revision gives you
 
01:33:46.790 --> 01:33:46.800 align:start position:0%
180 day deadline yeah so current yeah
 
01:33:48.629 --> 01:33:48.639 align:start position:0%
currently my understanding is that we
 
01:33:51.629 --> 01:33:51.639 align:start position:0%
have a backlog of around four months and
 
01:33:55.270 --> 01:33:55.280 align:start position:0%
so so so we we wanted to give ourselves
 
01:33:57.510 --> 01:33:57.520 align:start position:0%
a bit more time just in case we got
 
01:34:01.070 --> 01:34:01.080 align:start position:0%
slammed uh with a lot of certified rules
 
01:34:03.790 --> 01:34:03.800 align:start position:0%
um there is some wiggle room there I
 
01:34:06.750 --> 01:34:06.760 align:start position:0%
mean we would be agreeable to changing
 
01:34:09.910 --> 01:34:09.920 align:start position:0%
you know that timeline right now we do
 
01:34:12.629 --> 01:34:12.639 align:start position:0%
try to get those um revision and Source
 
01:34:14.510 --> 01:34:14.520 align:start position:0%
notes and the editing work done within
 
01:34:18.270 --> 01:34:18.280 align:start position:0%
that 120 days and back out to the agency
 
01:34:20.790 --> 01:34:20.800 align:start position:0%
um but Mike has been here a lot longer
 
01:34:23.550 --> 01:34:23.560 align:start position:0%
than me and speak to um that process how
 
01:34:28.790 --> 01:34:28.800 align:start position:0%
it's been working in the past okay um as
 
01:34:30.790 --> 01:34:30.800 align:start position:0%
Kim had referenced I I think the
 
01:34:34.470 --> 01:34:34.480 align:start position:0%
important part of this section is that
 
01:34:36.950 --> 01:34:36.960 align:start position:0%
as she said currently you could have a
 
01:34:38.950 --> 01:34:38.960 align:start position:0%
rule that's in effect but it's not
 
01:34:42.270 --> 01:34:42.280 align:start position:0%
published on our website for six months
 
01:34:46.030 --> 01:34:46.040 align:start position:0%
maybe even a year under the changes we
 
01:34:48.229 --> 01:34:48.239 align:start position:0%
would as soon as possible after the
 
01:34:51.510 --> 01:34:51.520 align:start position:0%
agency adopts and files a rule with our
 
01:34:53.870 --> 01:34:53.880 align:start position:0%
our office we would put that on the
 
01:34:56.790 --> 01:34:56.800 align:start position:0%
website and it would be just as adopted
 
01:34:58.149 --> 01:34:58.159 align:start position:0%
uh we won't have gone through the
 
01:35:00.149 --> 01:35:00.159 align:start position:0%
process with the agency of putting in
 
01:35:03.510 --> 01:35:03.520 align:start position:0%
Source notes and making sure all their
 
01:35:07.270 --> 01:35:07.280 align:start position:0%
eyes are dotted and tees across but this
 
01:35:09.189 --> 01:35:09.199 align:start position:0%
has been a problem both with the public
 
01:35:11.270 --> 01:35:11.280 align:start position:0%
and with agencies we've had several
 
01:35:13.430 --> 01:35:13.440 align:start position:0%
times just in the last year where
 
01:35:18.189 --> 01:35:18.199 align:start position:0%
agencies have put in a um a
 
01:35:21.510 --> 01:35:21.520 align:start position:0%
rule gone through a new Ru making to
 
01:35:25.470 --> 01:35:25.480 align:start position:0%
amend existing rules without realizing
 
01:35:27.229 --> 01:35:27.239 align:start position:0%
they had already done so the previous
 
01:35:31.430 --> 01:35:31.440 align:start position:0%
year they were looking back at the prior
 
01:35:33.510 --> 01:35:33.520 align:start position:0%
rule which might have been five or eight
 
01:35:35.870 --> 01:35:35.880 align:start position:0%
years old and the same thing happens
 
01:35:39.030 --> 01:35:39.040 align:start position:0%
with the public they will call us and
 
01:35:42.109 --> 01:35:42.119 align:start position:0%
say this rule says this but the agency's
 
01:35:44.310 --> 01:35:44.320 align:start position:0%
doing that well it turns out yes the
 
01:35:46.750 --> 01:35:46.760 align:start position:0%
agency adopted a new rule eight eight
 
01:35:49.669 --> 01:35:49.679 align:start position:0%
months ago and uh so they were doing
 
01:35:51.910 --> 01:35:51.920 align:start position:0%
what the rule says but the public
 
01:35:54.629 --> 01:35:54.639 align:start position:0%
looking on our website did not see
 
01:35:54.639 --> 01:35:56.430 align:start position:0%
looking on our website did not see
it

01:35:56.430 --> 01:35:56.440 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:35:58.590 --> 01:35:58.600 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
01:36:01.750 --> 01:36:01.760 align:start position:0%
so under this process you'll post it
 
01:36:01.760 --> 01:36:03.790 align:start position:0%
so under this process you'll post it
almost

01:36:03.790 --> 01:36:03.800 align:start position:0%
almost
 
01:36:05.950 --> 01:36:05.960 align:start position:0%
immediately with
 
01:36:09.189 --> 01:36:09.199 align:start position:0%
a um with with some kind of
 
01:36:15.149 --> 01:36:15.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:17.750 --> 01:36:17.760 align:start position:0%
expected we would indicate that it's you
 
01:36:19.990 --> 01:36:20.000 align:start position:0%
know the adopted and effective ruled as
 
01:36:23.109 --> 01:36:23.119 align:start position:0%
filed so by the agency so there would be
 
01:36:25.590 --> 01:36:25.600 align:start position:0%
that little disclaimer there but like I
 
01:36:27.470 --> 01:36:27.480 align:start position:0%
said uh you know once we've done our
 
01:36:29.109 --> 01:36:29.119 align:start position:0%
work with you know creating the source
 
01:36:30.669 --> 01:36:30.679 align:start position:0%
notes and revision notes and sometimes
 
01:36:32.229 --> 01:36:32.239 align:start position:0%
that can take a while too if there have
 
01:36:35.510 --> 01:36:35.520 align:start position:0%
been many changes um you know if there's
 
01:36:38.550 --> 01:36:38.560 align:start position:0%
been like movement between you know uh
 
01:36:40.709 --> 01:36:40.719 align:start position:0%
taking one chapter moving it to another
 
01:36:42.390 --> 01:36:42.400 align:start position:0%
those revision and Source notes can be
 
01:36:44.070 --> 01:36:44.080 align:start position:0%
kind of lengthy so it could take some
 
01:36:46.229 --> 01:36:46.239 align:start position:0%
time but anyway yeah the rule would be
 
01:36:49.070 --> 01:36:49.080 align:start position:0%
posted almost
 
01:36:50.910 --> 01:36:50.920 align:start position:0%
immediately which is a good thing
 
01:36:53.109 --> 01:36:53.119 align:start position:0%
because I I know I've looked for a rule
 
01:36:55.950 --> 01:36:55.960 align:start position:0%
that I know was approved by jel car and
 
01:36:59.470 --> 01:36:59.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:03.030 --> 01:37:03.040 align:start position:0%
there good thank you madam
 
01:37:06.430 --> 01:37:06.440 align:start position:0%
chair okay um so then the next part um
 
01:37:08.550 --> 01:37:08.560 align:start position:0%
sections nine and 10 would extend the
 
01:37:10.430 --> 01:37:10.440 align:start position:0%
final proposal and conditional approval
 
01:37:12.750 --> 01:37:12.760 align:start position:0%
of request deadlines that are currently
 
01:37:14.830 --> 01:37:14.840 align:start position:0%
in the statute and I'll just read from
 
01:37:17.390 --> 01:37:17.400 align:start position:0%
the bullet points here um it would
 
01:37:19.430 --> 01:37:19.440 align:start position:0%
change the filing deadline for final
 
01:37:21.629 --> 01:37:21.639 align:start position:0%
proposals from 21 days before the
 
01:37:24.310 --> 01:37:24.320 align:start position:0%
monthly meeting to 30 days it would
 
01:37:26.270 --> 01:37:26.280 align:start position:0%
change a conditional approval request
 
01:37:28.669 --> 01:37:28.679 align:start position:0%
from 7 days before the meeting to 10
 
01:37:31.430 --> 01:37:31.440 align:start position:0%
days before the meeting it would create
 
01:37:33.709 --> 01:37:33.719 align:start position:0%
a filing deadline for amended
 
01:37:35.950 --> 01:37:35.960 align:start position:0%
conditional approval request that
 
01:37:39.229 --> 01:37:39.239 align:start position:0%
address substantive comments of five
 
01:37:41.470 --> 01:37:41.480 align:start position:0%
days before the meeting it would
 
01:37:43.790 --> 01:37:43.800 align:start position:0%
prohibit the late filing of amended
 
01:37:45.629 --> 01:37:45.639 align:start position:0%
conditional approval requests pass that
 
01:37:48.109 --> 01:37:48.119 align:start position:0%
deadline by stating that no waivers will
 
01:37:50.550 --> 01:37:50.560 align:start position:0%
be granted and it would eliminate the
 
01:37:52.629 --> 01:37:52.639 align:start position:0%
filing of revised conditional approval
 
01:37:54.470 --> 01:37:54.480 align:start position:0%
request unless they are filed during the
 
01:37:56.990 --> 01:37:57.000 align:start position:0%
meeting the reason why we are proposing
 
01:37:59.550 --> 01:37:59.560 align:start position:0%
these is that we are being responsive to
 
01:38:01.870 --> 01:38:01.880 align:start position:0%
committee members concerns they often
 
01:38:05.030 --> 01:38:05.040 align:start position:0%
state that with the number of proposals
 
01:38:06.830 --> 01:38:06.840 align:start position:0%
on the agenda that they do not always
 
01:38:09.830 --> 01:38:09.840 align:start position:0%
have enough time to review those so our
 
01:38:12.390 --> 01:38:12.400 align:start position:0%
hope is that by shifting this deadline
 
01:38:15.470 --> 01:38:15.480 align:start position:0%
up a bit we can actually review and get
 
01:38:17.550 --> 01:38:17.560 align:start position:0%
those items posted on our website
 
01:38:19.470 --> 01:38:19.480 align:start position:0%
earlier so that the committee members
 
01:38:21.709 --> 01:38:21.719 align:start position:0%
will have more time to see them
 
01:38:24.790 --> 01:38:24.800 align:start position:0%
like I said um right now the the agenda
 
01:38:28.470 --> 01:38:28.480 align:start position:0%
can have around 30 proposals and um we
 
01:38:31.109 --> 01:38:31.119 align:start position:0%
do work with the agencies and a lot of
 
01:38:33.629 --> 01:38:33.639 align:start position:0%
those will go on consent but some of the
 
01:38:36.189 --> 01:38:36.199 align:start position:0%
other ones won't so you know we could
 
01:38:39.030 --> 01:38:39.040 align:start position:0%
have anywhere from 10 to 15 to 20 that
 
01:38:41.470 --> 01:38:41.480 align:start position:0%
could be on the regular agenda it's kind
 
01:38:44.510 --> 01:38:44.520 align:start position:0%
of you know it's proposal specific right
 
01:38:47.510 --> 01:38:47.520 align:start position:0%
so we don't really know but like I said
 
01:38:48.990 --> 01:38:49.000 align:start position:0%
our hope is that we would get those
 
01:38:53.189 --> 01:38:53.199 align:start position:0%
posted sooner and um we were also hoping
 
01:38:55.430 --> 01:38:55.440 align:start position:0%
that we would eliminate some of this
 
01:38:57.870 --> 01:38:57.880 align:start position:0%
extraneous filings and what I mean is
 
01:38:59.669 --> 01:38:59.679 align:start position:0%
that sometimes the agencies don't always
 
01:39:02.910 --> 01:39:02.920 align:start position:0%
have great Version Control and so
 
01:39:07.189 --> 01:39:07.199 align:start position:0%
sometimes say you know um the committee
 
01:39:09.709 --> 01:39:09.719 align:start position:0%
conditionally you know say they file a
 
01:39:12.229 --> 01:39:12.239 align:start position:0%
conditional approval request and then we
 
01:39:14.310 --> 01:39:14.320 align:start position:0%
take a look at it and we make comments
 
01:39:16.229 --> 01:39:16.239 align:start position:0%
we send that back to them and then they
 
01:39:18.669 --> 01:39:18.679 align:start position:0%
realize that they need to file a revised
 
01:39:20.390 --> 01:39:20.400 align:start position:0%
amended conditional approval request and
 
01:39:22.149 --> 01:39:22.159 align:start position:0%
they do that
 
01:39:24.149 --> 01:39:24.159 align:start position:0%
but instead of using their conditional
 
01:39:26.229 --> 01:39:26.239 align:start position:0%
approval request they use an older
 
01:39:29.750 --> 01:39:29.760 align:start position:0%
document well then it comes in and we've
 
01:39:33.030 --> 01:39:33.040 align:start position:0%
now have a ton of more comments on it um
 
01:39:35.350 --> 01:39:35.360 align:start position:0%
that can happen um the other thing that
 
01:39:38.430 --> 01:39:38.440 align:start position:0%
could happen is that uh sometimes they
 
01:39:41.669 --> 01:39:41.679 align:start position:0%
are um filing uh amended conditional
 
01:39:44.390 --> 01:39:44.400 align:start position:0%
approval request only to address
 
01:39:46.550 --> 01:39:46.560 align:start position:0%
editorial comments and not substantive
 
01:39:49.430 --> 01:39:49.440 align:start position:0%
comments and um as you can imagine with
 
01:39:51.550 --> 01:39:51.560 align:start position:0%
that many proposals coming in
 
01:39:53.189 --> 01:39:53.199 align:start position:0%
with us reviewing them that kind of
 
01:39:56.350 --> 01:39:56.360 align:start position:0%
takes a lot of time on us to review
 
01:39:59.070 --> 01:39:59.080 align:start position:0%
those when we could be looking at
 
01:40:02.270 --> 01:40:02.280 align:start position:0%
substantive substantive issues on other
 
01:40:05.470 --> 01:40:05.480 align:start position:0%
proposals so um like I said we were were
 
01:40:08.390 --> 01:40:08.400 align:start position:0%
doing this in order to have more time
 
01:40:10.390 --> 01:40:10.400 align:start position:0%
for the committee members to be able to
 
01:40:14.070 --> 01:40:14.080 align:start position:0%
review these proposals um the late filed
 
01:40:16.470 --> 01:40:16.480 align:start position:0%
items that could be filed during the
 
01:40:19.589 --> 01:40:19.599 align:start position:0%
meeting um Jael car rules do allow for
 
01:40:21.669 --> 01:40:21.679 align:start position:0%
that um they would to meet the
 
01:40:23.629 --> 01:40:23.639 align:start position:0%
requirements of the Jael car rule which
 
01:40:26.750 --> 01:40:26.760 align:start position:0%
is that they mostly resolve all the
 
01:40:30.629 --> 01:40:30.639 align:start position:0%
issues within the proposal and so um we
 
01:40:32.950 --> 01:40:32.960 align:start position:0%
are hoping that with this that we'll
 
01:40:36.149 --> 01:40:36.159 align:start position:0%
kind of you we'll get a better product
 
01:40:38.790 --> 01:40:38.800 align:start position:0%
we'll have less filings that aren't
 
01:40:42.070 --> 01:40:42.080 align:start position:0%
substantive that are only editorial and
 
01:40:43.870 --> 01:40:43.880 align:start position:0%
um like I said the main thing was trying
 
01:40:45.550 --> 01:40:45.560 align:start position:0%
to get these proposals in front of the
 
01:40:47.910 --> 01:40:47.920 align:start position:0%
committee members at an earlier period
 
01:40:50.310 --> 01:40:50.320 align:start position:0%
of time if you think about it now with
 
01:40:51.790 --> 01:40:51.800 align:start position:0%
the um
 
01:40:54.270 --> 01:40:54.280 align:start position:0%
with the deadlines you know if we take a
 
01:40:56.310 --> 01:40:56.320 align:start position:0%
couple of weeks to review a final
 
01:40:58.390 --> 01:40:58.400 align:start position:0%
proposal and send that back or if it
 
01:41:01.310 --> 01:41:01.320 align:start position:0%
takes a week or however long and uh then
 
01:41:04.470 --> 01:41:04.480 align:start position:0%
the agency files and sometimes they are
 
01:41:07.470 --> 01:41:07.480 align:start position:0%
filing conditional approval request the
 
01:41:09.390 --> 01:41:09.400 align:start position:0%
very last minute three or four days
 
01:41:11.550 --> 01:41:11.560 align:start position:0%
before the meeting that doesn't give the
 
01:41:13.790 --> 01:41:13.800 align:start position:0%
a that doesn't give the members enough
 
01:41:16.229 --> 01:41:16.239 align:start position:0%
time to review that proposal so that's
 
01:41:19.350 --> 01:41:19.360 align:start position:0%
the reason why for this
 
01:41:21.310 --> 01:41:21.320 align:start position:0%
amendment thank you representative
 
01:41:22.910 --> 01:41:22.920 align:start position:0%
Schmidt did you have a
 
01:41:26.950 --> 01:41:26.960 align:start position:0%
question thank you madam chair uh and
 
01:41:30.550 --> 01:41:30.560 align:start position:0%
you've been speaking to uh the concern
 
01:41:33.109 --> 01:41:33.119 align:start position:0%
that I wanted to to address uh more
 
01:41:37.910 --> 01:41:37.920 align:start position:0%
fully here uh I I understand the the
 
01:41:40.589 --> 01:41:40.599 align:start position:0%
completely the idea of the moving
 
01:41:43.990 --> 01:41:44.000 align:start position:0%
forward the of the or back whichever way
 
01:41:46.390 --> 01:41:46.400 align:start position:0%
you want to consider that um of these
 
01:41:49.750 --> 01:41:49.760 align:start position:0%
deadlines and so forth but since the the
 
01:41:51.750 --> 01:41:51.760 align:start position:0%
administ admin administrative rules
 
01:41:55.430 --> 01:41:55.440 align:start position:0%
units eyes are in some cases uh the last
 
01:41:58.149 --> 01:41:58.159 align:start position:0%
set of eyes that see things because if
 
01:41:59.390 --> 01:41:59.400 align:start position:0%
they're going to go on the consent
 
01:42:01.950 --> 01:42:01.960 align:start position:0%
calendar I mean any one of the Jael cars
 
01:42:03.870 --> 01:42:03.880 align:start position:0%
as those of us who are on the Jael car
 
01:42:06.910 --> 01:42:06.920 align:start position:0%
know we can pull it off but if you put
 
01:42:09.550 --> 01:42:09.560 align:start position:0%
it on the on the on the consent calendar
 
01:42:12.990 --> 01:42:13.000 align:start position:0%
because in your professional opinion the
 
01:42:16.550 --> 01:42:16.560 align:start position:0%
rule meets all the criteria for approval
 
01:42:18.350 --> 01:42:18.360 align:start position:0%
um then we're not going to pull it off
 
01:42:21.870 --> 01:42:21.880 align:start position:0%
just so we can redo your work uh but in
 
01:42:21.880 --> 01:42:23.109 align:start position:0%
just so we can redo your work uh but in
those

01:42:23.109 --> 01:42:23.119 align:start position:0%
those
 
01:42:25.870 --> 01:42:25.880 align:start position:0%
cases your eyes are really the def
 
01:42:28.589 --> 01:42:28.599 align:start position:0%
definitive and your expertise not just
 
01:42:33.270 --> 01:42:33.280 align:start position:0%
your eyes obviously uh the definitive uh
 
01:42:33.280 --> 01:42:35.030 align:start position:0%
your eyes obviously uh the definitive uh
decisionmaking

01:42:35.030 --> 01:42:35.040 align:start position:0%
decisionmaking
 
01:42:39.109 --> 01:42:39.119 align:start position:0%
um capacity uh to get the rules right
 
01:42:41.270 --> 01:42:41.280 align:start position:0%
and I really have a problem with the
 
01:42:44.470 --> 01:42:44.480 align:start position:0%
idea that things can get rushed and they
 
01:42:48.669 --> 01:42:48.679 align:start position:0%
don't get sufficiently vetted um so uh
 
01:42:51.270 --> 01:42:51.280 align:start position:0%
is is it some things are easy to see you
 
01:42:54.830 --> 01:42:54.840 align:start position:0%
can see that this is simple no problem
 
01:42:57.470 --> 01:42:57.480 align:start position:0%
and and you can effectively rubber stamp
 
01:43:00.550 --> 01:43:00.560 align:start position:0%
it because it is right in other
 
01:43:03.629 --> 01:43:03.639 align:start position:0%
situations it may be and it frequently
 
01:43:06.750 --> 01:43:06.760 align:start position:0%
is um more subtle and it really needs to
 
01:43:09.510 --> 01:43:09.520 align:start position:0%
be thought about and that needs time so
 
01:43:11.270 --> 01:43:11.280 align:start position:0%
are you going to have a way
 
01:43:15.189 --> 01:43:15.199 align:start position:0%
of pulling back from uh the commitment
 
01:43:18.550 --> 01:43:18.560 align:start position:0%
to get it done quickly if you see that
 
01:43:20.830 --> 01:43:20.840 align:start position:0%
it's not going to get vetted properly if
 
01:43:22.109 --> 01:43:22.119 align:start position:0%
if it's done
 
01:43:25.310 --> 01:43:25.320 align:start position:0%
quickly well I think we we definitely do
 
01:43:27.189 --> 01:43:27.199 align:start position:0%
I mean if you think about it we get an
 
01:43:30.229 --> 01:43:30.239 align:start position:0%
IP in and sometimes we get draft
 
01:43:32.910 --> 01:43:32.920 align:start position:0%
versions in and I was thinking about
 
01:43:35.709 --> 01:43:35.719 align:start position:0%
this recently sometimes I could
 
01:43:38.750 --> 01:43:38.760 align:start position:0%
review the same rule 8 to 10 times in
 
01:43:41.070 --> 01:43:41.080 align:start position:0%
anyone rule making if the agency decides
 
01:43:43.470 --> 01:43:43.480 align:start position:0%
that they're going to send us a draft IP
 
01:43:46.310 --> 01:43:46.320 align:start position:0%
or a draft final proposal so I think we
 
01:43:49.510 --> 01:43:49.520 align:start position:0%
do take some time I think the the issue
 
01:43:52.070 --> 01:43:52.080 align:start position:0%
is making sure that these get posted
 
01:43:55.350 --> 01:43:55.360 align:start position:0%
early enough you know we as we go
 
01:43:58.109 --> 01:43:58.119 align:start position:0%
through them the final proposals they
 
01:44:00.629 --> 01:44:00.639 align:start position:0%
are um uploaded to our website in a
 
01:44:03.109 --> 01:44:03.119 align:start position:0%
meeting packet form for committee review
 
01:44:05.109 --> 01:44:05.119 align:start position:0%
you know for committees members to
 
01:44:08.589 --> 01:44:08.599 align:start position:0%
review and so our hope is that you know
 
01:44:10.870 --> 01:44:10.880 align:start position:0%
by reviewing these shifting that
 
01:44:14.510 --> 01:44:14.520 align:start position:0%
deadline up then th that those items
 
01:44:17.189 --> 01:44:17.199 align:start position:0%
will be posted a little earlier you know
 
01:44:20.790 --> 01:44:20.800 align:start position:0%
in the process and uh thereby giving the
 
01:44:23.709 --> 01:44:23.719 align:start position:0%
committee members more time to review I
 
01:44:25.830 --> 01:44:25.840 align:start position:0%
do think committee members are reviewing
 
01:44:27.790 --> 01:44:27.800 align:start position:0%
proposals and they do review the ones
 
01:44:29.629 --> 01:44:29.639 align:start position:0%
that are on consent because we do
 
01:44:31.109 --> 01:44:31.119 align:start position:0%
sometimes have committee members pull
 
01:44:34.709 --> 01:44:34.719 align:start position:0%
them off of consent um we do discuss
 
01:44:37.270 --> 01:44:37.280 align:start position:0%
items with the chair and vice chair when
 
01:44:39.589 --> 01:44:39.599 align:start position:0%
we're not sure whether or not an item
 
01:44:43.189 --> 01:44:43.199 align:start position:0%
can go on consent um so we we do that as
 
01:44:46.030 --> 01:44:46.040 align:start position:0%
well I hope that answers the
 
01:44:48.669 --> 01:44:48.679 align:start position:0%
question okay well thank you for that I
 
01:44:50.990 --> 01:44:51.000 align:start position:0%
I mean obviously it's the sooner that we
 
01:44:53.910 --> 01:44:53.920 align:start position:0%
can get our hands on things to start
 
01:44:56.189 --> 01:44:56.199 align:start position:0%
looking at them the better it is the
 
01:44:58.750 --> 01:44:58.760 align:start position:0%
question is that whether it's being done
 
01:45:02.270 --> 01:45:02.280 align:start position:0%
sufficiently intensively on on on subtle
 
01:45:04.629 --> 01:45:04.639 align:start position:0%
things where you have to think about it
 
01:45:06.270 --> 01:45:06.280 align:start position:0%
whether this is really going to work
 
01:45:08.950 --> 01:45:08.960 align:start position:0%
because the rules have to work
 
01:45:11.149 --> 01:45:11.159 align:start position:0%
otherwise it's like just saying well
 
01:45:13.310 --> 01:45:13.320 align:start position:0%
just jump up there and dunk that ball
 
01:45:16.510 --> 01:45:16.520 align:start position:0%
and say I'm in a wheelchair I can't dunk
 
01:45:19.470 --> 01:45:19.480 align:start position:0%
anymore well I would say that um you
 
01:45:21.870 --> 01:45:21.880 align:start position:0%
know all proposed get more than one
 
01:45:25.950 --> 01:45:25.960 align:start position:0%
review so um you know I'll get the final
 
01:45:28.350 --> 01:45:28.360 align:start position:0%
proposal in we'll review that I'll send
 
01:45:30.750 --> 01:45:30.760 align:start position:0%
that over to Mike he will review it and
 
01:45:34.629 --> 01:45:34.639 align:start position:0%
then I'll review it again so um I don't
 
01:45:37.350 --> 01:45:37.360 align:start position:0%
envisioning that process changing at all
 
01:45:39.910 --> 01:45:39.920 align:start position:0%
so we'll still be doing that work so it
 
01:45:42.470 --> 01:45:42.480 align:start position:0%
will have more than one review very good
 
01:45:45.990 --> 01:45:46.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:49.870 --> 01:45:49.880 align:start position:0%
chair representative groda thank you um
 
01:45:53.510 --> 01:45:53.520 align:start position:0%
I take it because your Amendment deals
 
01:45:56.830 --> 01:45:56.840 align:start position:0%
with additions to the bill as opposed to
 
01:45:59.709 --> 01:45:59.719 align:start position:0%
comments about the bill itself that you
 
01:46:02.589 --> 01:46:02.599 align:start position:0%
have no comment on
 
01:46:05.790 --> 01:46:05.800 align:start position:0%
that okay I'm I'm I'm looking at
 
01:46:08.629 --> 01:46:08.639 align:start position:0%
sections in the original bill yeah we
 
01:46:12.470 --> 01:46:12.480 align:start position:0%
have section two which talks about oplc
 
01:46:14.910 --> 01:46:14.920 align:start position:0%
oh if you look down representative groa
 
01:46:16.669 --> 01:46:16.679 align:start position:0%
so I was just going to cover the items
 
01:46:19.950 --> 01:46:19.960 align:start position:0%
that were of importance to op OLS
 
01:46:19.960 --> 01:46:20.990 align:start position:0%
that were of importance to op OLS
operation

01:46:20.990 --> 01:46:21.000 align:start position:0%
operation
 
01:46:25.229 --> 01:46:25.239 align:start position:0%
first all right so um the the next
 
01:46:28.149 --> 01:46:28.159 align:start position:0%
section which is on page two of our uh
 
01:46:31.669 --> 01:46:31.679 align:start position:0%
our memorandum here is on um it would
 
01:46:35.550 --> 01:46:35.560 align:start position:0%
Amendment it would amend um RSA 541 a19
 
01:46:39.589 --> 01:46:39.599 align:start position:0%
C that's uh section 12 of the bill and
 
01:46:41.750 --> 01:46:41.760 align:start position:0%
uh this would allow the gel car to
 
01:46:43.430 --> 01:46:43.440 align:start position:0%
conditionally approved expedited
 
01:46:46.550 --> 01:46:46.560 align:start position:0%
revisions of forms so this is another
 
01:46:49.709 --> 01:46:49.719 align:start position:0%
substantive Amendment and um we were
 
01:46:51.870 --> 01:46:51.880 align:start position:0%
recommending this one based on feedback
 
01:46:55.350 --> 01:46:55.360 align:start position:0%
that we have received and just um what
 
01:46:57.790 --> 01:46:57.800 align:start position:0%
we have experienced
 
01:47:01.629 --> 01:47:01.639 align:start position:0%
um in this process so the um expedited
 
01:47:03.390 --> 01:47:03.400 align:start position:0%
revisions to forms the
 
01:47:07.669 --> 01:47:07.679 align:start position:0%
xrfs um right now there's not um the
 
01:47:09.990 --> 01:47:10.000 align:start position:0%
statute doesn't permit an agency to file
 
01:47:12.229 --> 01:47:12.239 align:start position:0%
a conditional approval request for that
 
01:47:14.109 --> 01:47:14.119 align:start position:0%
and we have encountered situations in
 
01:47:16.709 --> 01:47:16.719 align:start position:0%
which the agency did need to make
 
01:47:19.669 --> 01:47:19.679 align:start position:0%
changes and so this would allow for that
 
01:47:21.430 --> 01:47:21.440 align:start position:0%
to happen otherwise they would have to
 
01:47:23.430 --> 01:47:23.440 align:start position:0%
get a preliminary objection or they
 
01:47:26.709 --> 01:47:26.719 align:start position:0%
would have to withdraw entirely so um
 
01:47:28.470 --> 01:47:28.480 align:start position:0%
that was the reason for this one and it
 
01:47:31.750 --> 01:47:31.760 align:start position:0%
would also allow the um the Jael car
 
01:47:36.149 --> 01:47:36.159 align:start position:0%
committee to um to object to the rule if
 
01:47:39.709 --> 01:47:39.719 align:start position:0%
that the forms are Incorporated in so
 
01:47:42.550 --> 01:47:42.560 align:start position:0%
that was the reason for that Amendment
 
01:47:45.910 --> 01:47:45.920 align:start position:0%
the um the next one section four 5 and
 
01:47:50.030 --> 01:47:50.040 align:start position:0%
11 those are housekeeping amendments um
 
01:47:55.830 --> 01:47:55.840 align:start position:0%
they um the first one in section 4 it um
 
01:47:58.270 --> 01:47:58.280 align:start position:0%
let's see it's the deadline to respond
 
01:48:01.350 --> 01:48:01.360 align:start position:0%
what we were doing here is um making it
 
01:48:03.910 --> 01:48:03.920 align:start position:0%
so that a board doesn't have to file a
 
01:48:05.470 --> 01:48:05.480 align:start position:0%
conditional approval and adoption on the
 
01:48:08.310 --> 01:48:08.320 align:start position:0%
same day so that's the purpose for for
 
01:48:11.709 --> 01:48:11.719 align:start position:0%
this amendment and then uh five and 11
 
01:48:13.870 --> 01:48:13.880 align:start position:0%
remove out ofate references and an
 
01:48:13.880 --> 01:48:16.390 align:start position:0%
remove out ofate references and an
incorrect

01:48:16.390 --> 01:48:16.400 align:start position:0%
incorrect
 
01:48:21.350 --> 01:48:21.360 align:start position:0%
citation yeah go and just to clarify um
 
01:48:26.149 --> 01:48:26.159 align:start position:0%
your references to um sections 10 11 and
 
01:48:29.870 --> 01:48:29.880 align:start position:0%
12 refer to the proposed
 
01:48:33.510 --> 01:48:33.520 align:start position:0%
amendment thank you yes sections 9
 
01:48:37.430 --> 01:48:37.440 align:start position:0%
through 12 are um part of the amendment
 
01:48:42.030 --> 01:48:42.040 align:start position:0%
um regarding U section 4 um amending 54
 
01:48:42.040 --> 01:48:43.589 align:start position:0%
um regarding U section 4 um amending 54
A1

01:48:43.589 --> 01:48:43.599 align:start position:0%
A1
 
01:48:47.470 --> 01:48:47.480 align:start position:0%
1910 um part of this is because right
 
01:48:50.430 --> 01:48:50.440 align:start position:0%
now if an agency doesn't expedite
 
01:48:51.990 --> 01:48:52.000 align:start position:0%
revision form
 
01:48:54.229 --> 01:48:54.239 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm sorry we're talking interim
 
01:48:56.990 --> 01:48:57.000 align:start position:0%
rules interim rule process as most of
 
01:49:01.550 --> 01:49:01.560 align:start position:0%
you know is a uh quickened process by
 
01:49:03.629 --> 01:49:03.639 align:start position:0%
which an agency can adopt a rule right
 
01:49:05.790 --> 01:49:05.800 align:start position:0%
away there are only specific reasons
 
01:49:07.750 --> 01:49:07.760 align:start position:0%
such as the Rule's already expired or is
 
01:49:10.950 --> 01:49:10.960 align:start position:0%
about to expire or the court has made a
 
01:49:15.310 --> 01:49:15.320 align:start position:0%
decision that affects the rule Etc um
 
01:49:17.669 --> 01:49:17.679 align:start position:0%
right now everyone whether you're a
 
01:49:19.589 --> 01:49:19.599 align:start position:0%
board of commission or whether you're an
 
01:49:23.990 --> 01:49:24.000 align:start position:0%
agency has the same deadline to file um
 
01:49:27.669 --> 01:49:27.679 align:start position:0%
a response to the for the interim role
 
01:49:31.310 --> 01:49:31.320 align:start position:0%
where there's a conditional approval and
 
01:49:34.470 --> 01:49:34.480 align:start position:0%
that is very short I 14 days I think
 
01:49:37.270 --> 01:49:37.280 align:start position:0%
it's 14 days a lot of boards and
 
01:49:39.109 --> 01:49:39.119 align:start position:0%
commissions only meet once a month some
 
01:49:41.550 --> 01:49:41.560 align:start position:0%
of them only meet quarterly so in order
 
01:49:43.790 --> 01:49:43.800 align:start position:0%
to meet this deadline they often have to
 
01:49:46.070 --> 01:49:46.080 align:start position:0%
get a waiver uh from the director of
 
01:49:49.470 --> 01:49:49.480 align:start position:0%
legislative services in order to uh
 
01:49:51.709 --> 01:49:51.719 align:start position:0%
extend that deadline this would
 
01:49:55.550 --> 01:49:55.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:57.310 --> 01:49:57.320 align:start position:0%
problem thank
 
01:50:01.149 --> 01:50:01.159 align:start position:0%
you so um the remainder like um director
 
01:50:03.990 --> 01:50:04.000 align:start position:0%
moral said um we did make these
 
01:50:06.310 --> 01:50:06.320 align:start position:0%
recommendations um we're not taking a
 
01:50:07.830 --> 01:50:07.840 align:start position:0%
position on the retention of those
 
01:50:10.709 --> 01:50:10.719 align:start position:0%
sections we made those recommendations
 
01:50:14.189 --> 01:50:14.199 align:start position:0%
um mostly because in in response to gel
 
01:50:17.870 --> 01:50:17.880 align:start position:0%
car committee concerns um section one
 
01:50:20.070 --> 01:50:20.080 align:start position:0%
would require a rulle making requirement
 
01:50:23.310 --> 01:50:23.320 align:start position:0%
on the opl C's retention policy um I
 
01:50:26.149 --> 01:50:26.159 align:start position:0%
won't go through all of this um we do
 
01:50:29.070 --> 01:50:29.080 align:start position:0%
note that um you know the committee
 
01:50:32.109 --> 01:50:32.119 align:start position:0%
could opt to create a carveout you know
 
01:50:35.629 --> 01:50:35.639 align:start position:0%
for ruem for the oplc for this retention
 
01:50:39.310 --> 01:50:39.320 align:start position:0%
schedule um if you look there in the
 
01:50:42.990 --> 01:50:43.000 align:start position:0%
subsequent paragraphs um the Department
 
01:50:44.669 --> 01:50:44.679 align:start position:0%
of State Division of archives and
 
01:50:46.189 --> 01:50:46.199 align:start position:0%
Records management has the
 
01:50:49.270 --> 01:50:49.280 align:start position:0%
responsibility of um of maintaining
 
01:50:52.310 --> 01:50:52.320 align:start position:0%
State records and um they do have Ru
 
01:50:55.790 --> 01:50:55.800 align:start position:0%
making authority to establish guidelines
 
01:50:58.550 --> 01:50:58.560 align:start position:0%
but the rules expired in 1990 and so
 
01:51:01.950 --> 01:51:01.960 align:start position:0%
there are no established guidelines and
 
01:51:05.589 --> 01:51:05.599 align:start position:0%
um our uh position has been that the
 
01:51:07.669 --> 01:51:07.679 align:start position:0%
retention policy clearly Falls
 
01:51:09.709 --> 01:51:09.719 align:start position:0%
underneath the definition of a rule
 
01:51:11.189 --> 01:51:11.199 align:start position:0%
meaning that it needs to go through the
 
01:51:14.589 --> 01:51:14.599 align:start position:0%
541a process so if the committee
 
01:51:17.229 --> 01:51:17.239 align:start position:0%
disagrees with that or feels that it
 
01:51:19.189 --> 01:51:19.199 align:start position:0%
should not go through the ru making
 
01:51:22.229 --> 01:51:22.239 align:start position:0%
process you could always do a uh you
 
01:51:24.589 --> 01:51:24.599 align:start position:0%
know you could do a carve out from 541a
 
01:51:27.550 --> 01:51:27.560 align:start position:0%
for it and this provides the um the
 
01:51:30.189 --> 01:51:30.199 align:start position:0%
rationale for why we you know why we
 
01:51:31.709 --> 01:51:31.719 align:start position:0%
made the recommendation based on
 
01:51:31.719 --> 01:51:38.149 align:start position:0%
made the recommendation based on
committee

01:51:38.149 --> 01:51:38.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:41.270 --> 01:51:41.280 align:start position:0%
concerns okay now I forgot what it
 
01:51:45.870 --> 01:51:45.880 align:start position:0%
say um as Kim said we believe that uh
 
01:51:49.149 --> 01:51:49.159 align:start position:0%
setting up a retention policy in a rule
 
01:51:52.229 --> 01:51:52.239 align:start position:0%
is necessary because it it is a rule it
 
01:51:54.910 --> 01:51:54.920 align:start position:0%
affects people outside the agency the
 
01:51:56.950 --> 01:51:56.960 align:start position:0%
public may want to know well how long
 
01:51:59.750 --> 01:51:59.760 align:start position:0%
are they going to keep this record um
 
01:52:03.109 --> 01:52:03.119 align:start position:0%
most boards uh and agencies do have
 
01:52:05.069 --> 01:52:05.079 align:start position:0%
retention schedules it'll say something
 
01:52:07.350 --> 01:52:07.360 align:start position:0%
like shall retain all records for a
 
01:52:10.709 --> 01:52:10.719 align:start position:0%
period of three years and otherwise un
 
01:52:13.950 --> 01:52:13.960 align:start position:0%
less otherwise uh dictated by the
 
01:52:17.069 --> 01:52:17.079 align:start position:0%
director of archives
 
01:52:19.430 --> 01:52:19.440 align:start position:0%
um we think that's very important for
 
01:52:21.430 --> 01:52:21.440 align:start position:0%
people to know I some of the bigger
 
01:52:25.229 --> 01:52:25.239 align:start position:0%
agencies have more than one retention um
 
01:52:28.109 --> 01:52:28.119 align:start position:0%
rule because it depends on sometimes the
 
01:52:30.709 --> 01:52:30.719 align:start position:0%
statutes require a certain period
 
01:52:31.950 --> 01:52:31.960 align:start position:0%
sometimes it's a different type of
 
01:52:34.270 --> 01:52:34.280 align:start position:0%
program and the retention period may
 
01:52:38.390 --> 01:52:38.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:40.750 --> 01:52:40.760 align:start position:0%
longer can I just ask what is the
 
01:52:47.069 --> 01:52:47.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:50.149 --> 01:52:50.159 align:start position:0%
issue if it's since it shows up every
 
01:52:52.870 --> 01:52:52.880 align:start position:0%
time there's a question about it and we
 
01:52:55.470 --> 01:52:55.480 align:start position:0%
keep getting nagged about it I'd like to
 
01:52:58.629 --> 01:52:58.639 align:start position:0%
either put in a clear requirement or
 
01:53:00.950 --> 01:53:00.960 align:start position:0%
just say they don't it doesn't need to
 
01:53:03.669 --> 01:53:03.679 align:start position:0%
be a rule we need to decide one way or
 
01:53:05.629 --> 01:53:05.639 align:start position:0%
the other
 
01:53:09.430 --> 01:53:09.440 align:start position:0%
and if the director of archives has let
 
01:53:12.950 --> 01:53:12.960 align:start position:0%
his rules lapse for 35 years I'd say we
 
01:53:15.430 --> 01:53:15.440 align:start position:0%
may not need to go through Ru
 
01:53:19.430 --> 01:53:19.440 align:start position:0%
making personally but I'm willing to to
 
01:53:25.990 --> 01:53:26.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:28.750 --> 01:53:28.760 align:start position:0%
subcommittee we we are not sure how much
 
01:53:31.669 --> 01:53:31.679 align:start position:0%
of a burden this would place on oplc
 
01:53:34.270 --> 01:53:34.280 align:start position:0%
because they cover over 50 boards some
 
01:53:36.669 --> 01:53:36.679 align:start position:0%
are advisory boards some are governing
 
01:53:38.669 --> 01:53:38.679 align:start position:0%
boards I don't know if they would
 
01:53:40.990 --> 01:53:41.000 align:start position:0%
anticipate having to have different
 
01:53:44.310 --> 01:53:44.320 align:start position:0%
retention periods for different boards
 
01:53:47.149 --> 01:53:47.159 align:start position:0%
it could be burdensome on that but uh I
 
01:53:49.189 --> 01:53:49.199 align:start position:0%
think they would be better able to speak
 
01:53:52.229 --> 01:53:52.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:54.629 --> 01:53:54.639 align:start position:0%
thank you we'll we have Mr Oster out
 
01:54:04.390 --> 01:54:04.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:07.709 --> 01:54:07.719 align:start position:0%
thinks I guess I'm I'm just um chatting
 
01:54:10.750 --> 01:54:10.760 align:start position:0%
with um I shouldn't be chatting I do
 
01:54:13.069 --> 01:54:13.079 align:start position:0%
think that the idea of record
 
01:54:16.550 --> 01:54:16.560 align:start position:0%
retention did come up in previous
 
01:54:20.669 --> 01:54:20.679 align:start position:0%
hearings on o with with oplc so if you
 
01:54:22.830 --> 01:54:22.840 align:start position:0%
can recall Mr O to have what that
 
01:54:25.149 --> 01:54:25.159 align:start position:0%
discussion was you we could use a
 
01:54:29.990 --> 01:54:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:39.550 --> 01:54:39.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:43.149 --> 01:54:43.159 align:start position:0%
two I I can tell you that when this came
 
01:54:45.990 --> 01:54:46.000 align:start position:0%
before gel car they did not object on
 
01:54:46.000 --> 01:54:48.109 align:start position:0%
before gel car they did not object on
that

01:54:48.109 --> 01:54:48.119 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:54:50.270 --> 01:54:50.280 align:start position:0%
basis yeah that that's correct the
 
01:54:52.229 --> 01:54:52.239 align:start position:0%
committee did not object on that basis
 
01:54:54.910 --> 01:54:54.920 align:start position:0%
so and I believe they did get a copy of
 
01:54:57.629 --> 01:54:57.639 align:start position:0%
the Excel spreadsheet that outlined um
 
01:55:03.270 --> 01:55:03.280 align:start position:0%
the retention policy right so on um the
 
01:55:05.830 --> 01:55:05.840 align:start position:0%
next would you like to hear from
 
01:55:09.109 --> 01:55:09.119 align:start position:0%
attorney a to help now okay yes I think
 
01:55:14.669 --> 01:55:14.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:17.510 --> 01:55:17.520 align:start position:0%
around morning Douglas ooster how is it
 
01:55:21.310 --> 01:55:21.320 align:start position:0%
morning good morning Douglas
 
01:55:21.320 --> 01:55:23.589 align:start position:0%
morning good morning Douglas
OPC

01:55:23.589 --> 01:55:23.599 align:start position:0%
OPC
 
01:55:26.830 --> 01:55:26.840 align:start position:0%
um I mean I think I think our stance has
 
01:55:28.669 --> 01:55:28.679 align:start position:0%
been pretty clear that I don't think we
 
01:55:31.709 --> 01:55:31.719 align:start position:0%
need a special carve out for adopting
 
01:55:35.189 --> 01:55:35.199 align:start position:0%
the Secretary of State's rules um I do
 
01:55:37.229 --> 01:55:37.239 align:start position:0%
remember at Jael car when we had the the
 
01:55:39.149 --> 01:55:39.159 align:start position:0%
conversation the executive director
 
01:55:41.470 --> 01:55:41.480 align:start position:0%
testified there was no objection and I I
 
01:55:43.390 --> 01:55:43.400 align:start position:0%
believe it was Senator Lang made a
 
01:55:45.030 --> 01:55:45.040 align:start position:0%
comment to the effect of we're holding
 
01:55:47.510 --> 01:55:47.520 align:start position:0%
the wrong agency responsible for for
 
01:55:50.069 --> 01:55:50.079 align:start position:0%
this uh I tend to agree agree with that
 
01:55:53.990 --> 01:55:54.000 align:start position:0%
statement I think if if the committee
 
01:55:56.510 --> 01:55:56.520 align:start position:0%
decides uh rules need to be done I don't
 
01:55:59.790 --> 01:55:59.800 align:start position:0%
think I I don't think this language is
 
01:56:01.310 --> 01:56:01.320 align:start position:0%
is the way it should be done we do have
 
01:56:03.990 --> 01:56:04.000 align:start position:0%
the policy in place um to address
 
01:56:07.870 --> 01:56:07.880 align:start position:0%
director Mor's question I don't think we
 
01:56:10.189 --> 01:56:10.199 align:start position:0%
we we've got our spreadsheet but I I
 
01:56:13.390 --> 01:56:13.400 align:start position:0%
that sort of covers everything um but
 
01:56:16.550 --> 01:56:16.560 align:start position:0%
it's not really a different policy um or
 
01:56:18.350 --> 01:56:18.360 align:start position:0%
practice of keeping records sent over to
 
01:56:21.030 --> 01:56:21.040 align:start position:0%
archives another concern is addressing
 
01:56:23.030 --> 01:56:23.040 align:start position:0%
archives and I don't know the interplay
 
01:56:26.229 --> 01:56:26.239 align:start position:0%
between if we have the rules adopted and
 
01:56:27.990 --> 01:56:28.000 align:start position:0%
there's conflicts with Secretary of
 
01:56:31.149 --> 01:56:31.159 align:start position:0%
State rules or archiving or I'm not
 
01:56:32.750 --> 01:56:32.760 align:start position:0%
really sure what the expectation is
 
01:56:35.629 --> 01:56:35.639 align:start position:0%
there as far as are we are we expected
 
01:56:37.510 --> 01:56:37.520 align:start position:0%
to set up sort of our own archival
 
01:56:40.310 --> 01:56:40.320 align:start position:0%
system separate and distinct from
 
01:56:41.950 --> 01:56:41.960 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State and every other
 
01:56:43.950 --> 01:56:43.960 align:start position:0%
agency I I don't know if that's the
 
01:56:46.870 --> 01:56:46.880 align:start position:0%
intention or what that means um so that
 
01:56:48.470 --> 01:56:48.480 align:start position:0%
that is our stance that
 
01:56:48.480 --> 01:56:50.310 align:start position:0%
that is our stance that
I

01:56:50.310 --> 01:56:50.320 align:start position:0%
I
 
01:56:50.320 --> 01:56:52.830 align:start position:0%
I
representative

01:56:52.830 --> 01:56:52.840 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:56:57.470 --> 01:56:57.480 align:start position:0%
Schmid thank you mam chair so as you as
 
01:57:00.069 --> 01:57:00.079 align:start position:0%
some of us are aware we have a new
 
01:57:04.069 --> 01:57:04.079 align:start position:0%
archist okay um uh and she was before
 
01:57:08.550 --> 01:57:08.560 align:start position:0%
this committee uh relatively recently uh
 
01:57:11.270 --> 01:57:11.280 align:start position:0%
and so and she's in the process of
 
01:57:13.629 --> 01:57:13.639 align:start position:0%
reviewing a lot of stuff that may have
 
01:57:16.390 --> 01:57:16.400 align:start position:0%
been to some degree Gathering dust for a
 
01:57:18.470 --> 01:57:18.480 align:start position:0%
while but because she's looking at
 
01:57:22.350 --> 01:57:22.360 align:start position:0%
things in uh a new uh I think we should
 
01:57:25.069 --> 01:57:25.079 align:start position:0%
reach out to her and uh and try and
 
01:57:27.270 --> 01:57:27.280 align:start position:0%
coordinate things as well as possible
 
01:57:30.870 --> 01:57:30.880 align:start position:0%
because it's clear that we uh that we we
 
01:57:32.229 --> 01:57:32.239 align:start position:0%
we don't want to have stuff sitting
 
01:57:35.069 --> 01:57:35.079 align:start position:0%
around in the archives that has no
 
01:57:37.990 --> 01:57:38.000 align:start position:0%
longterm value by the Same by the same
 
01:57:40.350 --> 01:57:40.360 align:start position:0%
token we also don't want to have
 
01:57:42.430 --> 01:57:42.440 align:start position:0%
completely lost touch with it where you
 
01:57:44.149 --> 01:57:44.159 align:start position:0%
going like it's kind of like the checks
 
01:57:46.629 --> 01:57:46.639 align:start position:0%
from 30 years ago they must be around
 
01:57:49.030 --> 01:57:49.040 align:start position:0%
here someplace but uh I don't know where
 
01:57:51.229 --> 01:57:51.239 align:start position:0%
that place place is and it may take me a
 
01:57:53.669 --> 01:57:53.679 align:start position:0%
couple years to find them or I could
 
01:57:56.589 --> 01:57:56.599 align:start position:0%
stumble ac across them tomorrow looking
 
01:57:58.990 --> 01:57:59.000 align:start position:0%
for something else but we we need to
 
01:58:02.629 --> 01:58:02.639 align:start position:0%
have a more uh flexible system but also
 
01:58:05.830 --> 01:58:05.840 align:start position:0%
one that is in touch with reality so I
 
01:58:07.189 --> 01:58:07.199 align:start position:0%
think the fact that we have a new
 
01:58:10.629 --> 01:58:10.639 align:start position:0%
archivist looking at things um and and
 
01:58:12.870 --> 01:58:12.880 align:start position:0%
evaluating things and making changes as
 
01:58:15.629 --> 01:58:15.639 align:start position:0%
well is beneficial if we work together
 
01:58:17.790 --> 01:58:17.800 align:start position:0%
with her thank
 
01:58:21.589 --> 01:58:21.599 align:start position:0%
you representative uire in response to
 
01:58:24.270 --> 01:58:24.280 align:start position:0%
that and the information I suggest that
 
01:58:26.790 --> 01:58:26.800 align:start position:0%
we delete section
 
01:58:32.189 --> 01:58:32.199 align:start position:0%
one and let the state archist figure out
 
01:58:36.550 --> 01:58:36.560 align:start position:0%
what what should be done
 
01:58:36.560 --> 01:58:38.310 align:start position:0%
what what should be done
and

01:58:38.310 --> 01:58:38.320 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:58:41.189 --> 01:58:41.199 align:start position:0%
um the statute already requires the
 
01:58:43.750 --> 01:58:43.760 align:start position:0%
office to maintain official records in
 
01:58:45.990 --> 01:58:46.000 align:start position:0%
accordance with their retention
 
01:58:48.510 --> 01:58:48.520 align:start position:0%
policy that should be good enough unless
 
01:58:50.709 --> 01:58:50.719 align:start position:0%
the the archivist comes up with
 
01:58:53.109 --> 01:58:53.119 align:start position:0%
something different we I think that
 
01:58:56.430 --> 01:58:56.440 align:start position:0%
you're they're totally correct that if
 
01:58:59.390 --> 01:58:59.400 align:start position:0%
the archist has the responsibility for
 
01:59:02.430 --> 01:59:02.440 align:start position:0%
rules for that we don't want to have two
 
01:59:09.709 --> 01:59:09.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:13.790 --> 01:59:13.800 align:start position:0%
conflict can I just ask does does that
 
01:59:13.800 --> 01:59:18.229 align:start position:0%
conflict can I just ask does does that
agreeable

01:59:18.229 --> 01:59:18.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:18.239 --> 01:59:22.790 align:start position:0%
 
to

01:59:22.790 --> 01:59:22.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:26.430 --> 01:59:26.440 align:start position:0%
Mike moral again uh yes that that would
 
01:59:29.910 --> 01:59:29.920 align:start position:0%
be fine and I would be willing to uh try
 
01:59:32.470 --> 01:59:32.480 align:start position:0%
to facilitate a meeting with Secretary
 
01:59:35.629 --> 01:59:35.639 align:start position:0%
of State Andor the new director along
 
01:59:37.550 --> 01:59:37.560 align:start position:0%
with Douglas or other representative
 
01:59:42.430 --> 01:59:42.440 align:start position:0%
from oplc to discuss uh rulemaking with
 
01:59:45.990 --> 01:59:46.000 align:start position:0%
them thank you that would be great um
 
01:59:47.750 --> 01:59:47.760 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm guessing we are not going to
 
01:59:50.790 --> 01:59:50.800 align:start position:0%
exact this until the 13 is that that is
 
01:59:54.669 --> 01:59:54.679 align:start position:0%
correct so um yeah I'm not sure if we'll
 
01:59:56.669 --> 01:59:56.679 align:start position:0%
have another subcommittee meeting but if
 
01:59:59.390 --> 01:59:59.400 align:start position:0%
we can hear from you if we need to make
 
02:00:02.790 --> 02:00:02.800 align:start position:0%
further changes thank you okay perhaps
 
02:00:07.390 --> 02:00:07.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:10.669 --> 02:00:10.679 align:start position:0%
that on on section two which has to do
 
02:00:10.679 --> 02:00:11.550 align:start position:0%
that on on section two which has to do
with

02:00:11.550 --> 02:00:11.560 align:start position:0%
with
 
02:00:14.069 --> 02:00:14.079 align:start position:0%
oplc license
 
02:00:15.910 --> 02:00:15.920 align:start position:0%
renewals I think what they're trying to
 
02:00:17.950 --> 02:00:17.960 align:start position:0%
do is they're trying to
 
02:00:19.669 --> 02:00:19.679 align:start position:0%
clarify um
 
02:00:19.679 --> 02:00:22.350 align:start position:0%
clarify um
what

02:00:22.350 --> 02:00:22.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:25.189 --> 02:00:25.199 align:start position:0%
licenses I don't know if we need that
 
02:00:27.030 --> 02:00:27.040 align:start position:0%
because we are I mean it's in statute
 
02:00:31.229 --> 02:00:31.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:33.270 --> 02:00:33.280 align:start position:0%
years the reason why we made the
 
02:00:34.950 --> 02:00:34.960 align:start position:0%
recommendation is because many of the
 
02:00:37.270 --> 02:00:37.280 align:start position:0%
board statutes have not yet been amended
 
02:00:40.589 --> 02:00:40.599 align:start position:0%
to remove this conflict so the oplc
 
02:00:40.599 --> 02:00:41.709 align:start position:0%
to remove this conflict so the oplc
statute

02:00:41.709 --> 02:00:41.719 align:start position:0%
statute
 
02:00:45.030 --> 02:00:45.040 align:start position:0%
3108 I think section two says that they
 
02:00:46.830 --> 02:00:46.840 align:start position:0%
will expire two years from the date of
 
02:00:48.510 --> 02:00:48.520 align:start position:0%
issuance correct but there are other
 
02:00:50.069 --> 02:00:50.079 align:start position:0%
board stat statutes that say that they
 
02:00:52.990 --> 02:00:53.000 align:start position:0%
will expire in the lenses birth month so
 
02:00:55.550 --> 02:00:55.560 align:start position:0%
then rather than recommend that every
 
02:00:58.109 --> 02:00:58.119 align:start position:0%
statute be amended we recommended this
 
02:01:01.350 --> 02:01:01.360 align:start position:0%
language so that that conflict could be
 
02:01:03.350 --> 02:01:03.360 align:start position:0%
ignored okay so we're going to leave it
 
02:01:08.149 --> 02:01:08.159 align:start position:0%
in okay thank you that that Mr Rous is
 
02:01:09.510 --> 02:01:09.520 align:start position:0%
that your your
 
02:01:11.790 --> 02:01:11.800 align:start position:0%
suggestion I mean if we could do another
 
02:01:15.430 --> 02:01:15.440 align:start position:0%
100 page Bill next year two I'd really
 
02:01:15.440 --> 02:01:16.589 align:start position:0%
100 page Bill next year two I'd really
rather

02:01:16.589 --> 02:01:16.599 align:start position:0%
rather
 
02:01:19.950 --> 02:01:19.960 align:start position:0%
not uh no one comment I do have is under
 
02:01:23.310 --> 02:01:23.320 align:start position:0%
540 or no HP
 
02:01:27.350 --> 02:01:27.360 align:start position:0%
518 we did change the definition of
 
02:01:32.510 --> 02:01:32.520 align:start position:0%
license so that it comports with um
 
02:01:36.390 --> 02:01:36.400 align:start position:0%
541a in RSA 310 so we could probably
 
02:01:39.430 --> 02:01:39.440 align:start position:0%
just m change the language to all
 
02:01:41.709 --> 02:01:41.719 align:start position:0%
licenses and then we wouldn't need to
 
02:01:43.790 --> 02:01:43.800 align:start position:0%
identify registration certifications R
 
02:01:46.109 --> 02:01:46.119 align:start position:0%
all the other things that would be my
 
02:01:48.589 --> 02:01:48.599 align:start position:0%
only suggestion on that piece okay all
 
02:02:06.470 --> 02:02:06.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:13.950 --> 02:02:13.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:16.669 --> 02:02:16.679 align:start position:0%
questions I was going to say the the
 
02:02:19.990 --> 02:02:20.000 align:start position:0%
rest of the um the bill sections six
 
02:02:23.709 --> 02:02:23.719 align:start position:0%
seven um let me see here six seven and
 
02:02:27.790 --> 02:02:27.800 align:start position:0%
eight kind of all go hand inand um
 
02:02:30.109 --> 02:02:30.119 align:start position:0%
section six uh We've made this
 
02:02:31.990 --> 02:02:32.000 align:start position:0%
recommendation in response to Jael car
 
02:02:34.109 --> 02:02:34.119 align:start position:0%
committee concerns about the enforcement
 
02:02:38.069 --> 02:02:38.079 align:start position:0%
of expired rules um 541a is pretty
 
02:02:40.350 --> 02:02:40.360 align:start position:0%
explicit that agencies are not to
 
02:02:44.189 --> 02:02:44.199 align:start position:0%
enforce expired rules but um we have
 
02:02:48.310 --> 02:02:48.320 align:start position:0%
been encountering that a lot and so um
 
02:02:50.270 --> 02:02:50.280 align:start position:0%
we made this recommendation in response
 
02:02:53.790 --> 02:02:53.800 align:start position:0%
to that concern so um section six would
 
02:02:57.149 --> 02:02:57.159 align:start position:0%
allow the court U marac County Superior
 
02:03:01.069 --> 02:03:01.079 align:start position:0%
Court if the court so chooses to Levy a
 
02:03:03.430 --> 02:03:03.440 align:start position:0%
financial penalty upon an agency for
 
02:03:06.430 --> 02:03:06.440 align:start position:0%
enforcing an expired rule again that is
 
02:03:10.109 --> 02:03:10.119 align:start position:0%
if the C court so chooses to do so um if
 
02:03:12.189 --> 02:03:12.199 align:start position:0%
they were if the court was asked to
 
02:03:14.270 --> 02:03:14.280 align:start position:0%
issue a declaratory judgment on an
 
02:03:17.510 --> 02:03:17.520 align:start position:0%
expired rule so um you know an expired
 
02:03:20.189 --> 02:03:20.199 align:start position:0%
rule is no longer law it doesn't matter
 
02:03:22.430 --> 02:03:22.440 align:start position:0%
what the rule was governing um it can't
 
02:03:25.470 --> 02:03:25.480 align:start position:0%
be enforced and like I said uh we are
 
02:03:27.430 --> 02:03:27.440 align:start position:0%
encountering situations in which the
 
02:03:31.109 --> 02:03:31.119 align:start position:0%
rules have been enforced um the other
 
02:03:34.430 --> 02:03:34.440 align:start position:0%
two sections seven and eight are also
 
02:03:37.030 --> 02:03:37.040 align:start position:0%
about the enforcement of expired rules
 
02:03:40.629 --> 02:03:40.639 align:start position:0%
um the seven is around the refunding it
 
02:03:43.069 --> 02:03:43.079 align:start position:0%
would require agencies to refund fines
 
02:03:47.350 --> 02:03:47.360 align:start position:0%
and fees collected on that expired rule
 
02:03:49.510 --> 02:03:49.520 align:start position:0%
so um like I said
 
02:03:51.870 --> 02:03:51.880 align:start position:0%
you know the statute is pretty clear
 
02:03:53.950 --> 02:03:53.960 align:start position:0%
that agencies should not be enforcing
 
02:03:57.109 --> 02:03:57.119 align:start position:0%
expired rules for any purpose and so
 
02:04:00.870 --> 02:04:00.880 align:start position:0%
this would basically um direct the
 
02:04:03.750 --> 02:04:03.760 align:start position:0%
agencies to refund any fees or fines
 
02:04:06.830 --> 02:04:06.840 align:start position:0%
that they collected on an expired role
 
02:04:11.270 --> 02:04:11.280 align:start position:0%
um Section 8 um would uh require the
 
02:04:13.669 --> 02:04:13.679 align:start position:0%
agencies to file an additional report
 
02:04:15.870 --> 02:04:15.880 align:start position:0%
and they already have to file a report
 
02:04:19.069 --> 02:04:19.079 align:start position:0%
with their final proposal outlining
 
02:04:21.750 --> 02:04:21.760 align:start position:0%
stakeholder comments and how they
 
02:04:24.549 --> 02:04:24.559 align:start position:0%
considered those comments so this would
 
02:04:28.109 --> 02:04:28.119 align:start position:0%
be uh in addition to that report it
 
02:04:30.990 --> 02:04:31.000 align:start position:0%
would um basically outline what
 
02:04:32.589 --> 02:04:32.599 align:start position:0%
enforcement actions they have taken
 
02:04:35.189 --> 02:04:35.199 align:start position:0%
pursuant to the expired Rule and it
 
02:04:36.790 --> 02:04:36.800 align:start position:0%
would specifically require them to
 
02:04:38.910 --> 02:04:38.920 align:start position:0%
include whether or not any fines or fees
 
02:04:40.510 --> 02:04:40.520 align:start position:0%
were assessed and whether or not they
 
02:04:43.390 --> 02:04:43.400 align:start position:0%
have been refunded so that in in an
 
02:04:46.470 --> 02:04:46.480 align:start position:0%
Essence is what these three sections are
 
02:04:49.750 --> 02:04:49.760 align:start position:0%
about representative Maguire yes this is
 
02:04:52.310 --> 02:04:52.320 align:start position:0%
a question that that the Jael car has
 
02:04:55.069 --> 02:04:55.079 align:start position:0%
been asking on every rule that comes
 
02:04:58.189 --> 02:04:58.199 align:start position:0%
before them that was expired and the
 
02:05:00.750 --> 02:05:00.760 align:start position:0%
agencies generally have the response
 
02:05:03.990 --> 02:05:04.000 align:start position:0%
it'll say it will this change will
 
02:05:07.270 --> 02:05:07.280 align:start position:0%
simply put that response into the
 
02:05:10.430 --> 02:05:10.440 align:start position:0%
permanent record of the rule be because
 
02:05:13.310 --> 02:05:13.320 align:start position:0%
it'll be part of the final package and I
 
02:05:16.109 --> 02:05:16.119 align:start position:0%
I think we need that regardless of any
 
02:05:21.149 --> 02:05:21.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:23.589 --> 02:05:23.599 align:start position:0%
uh M Mr moral thank you I would like to
 
02:05:29.870 --> 02:05:29.880 align:start position:0%
note that uh oplc is uh by and large an
 
02:05:32.709 --> 02:05:32.719 align:start position:0%
exception to this uh frequently when
 
02:05:35.229 --> 02:05:35.239 align:start position:0%
they become be come before Jael car they
 
02:05:38.149 --> 02:05:38.159 align:start position:0%
know that there's an expired Rule and
 
02:05:40.390 --> 02:05:40.400 align:start position:0%
they will look without asking by the
 
02:05:42.189 --> 02:05:42.199 align:start position:0%
committee whether or not it's been
 
02:05:44.629 --> 02:05:44.639 align:start position:0%
enforced whether any fines have been
 
02:05:48.750 --> 02:05:48.760 align:start position:0%
imposed uh Etc and they have even gone
 
02:05:51.390 --> 02:05:51.400 align:start position:0%
to the step of returning fees that were
 
02:05:55.229 --> 02:05:55.239 align:start position:0%
collected uh under expired
 
02:05:59.030 --> 02:05:59.040 align:start position:0%
rules I I would add that this that the
 
02:06:01.629 --> 02:06:01.639 align:start position:0%
underlying issue is enforcement of those
 
02:06:05.109 --> 02:06:05.119 align:start position:0%
expired rules uh the process we've laid
 
02:06:08.189 --> 02:06:08.199 align:start position:0%
out here in six seven and 8 may not be
 
02:06:10.750 --> 02:06:10.760 align:start position:0%
the best there may be others that would
 
02:06:13.149 --> 02:06:13.159 align:start position:0%
work better but it was just an idea how
 
02:06:15.950 --> 02:06:15.960 align:start position:0%
to address this
 
02:06:18.390 --> 02:06:18.400 align:start position:0%
situation and one other thing to note is
 
02:06:21.069 --> 02:06:21.079 align:start position:0%
that um you know the fines and fees are
 
02:06:23.950 --> 02:06:23.960 align:start position:0%
often not set by Statute the agency is
 
02:06:25.790 --> 02:06:25.800 align:start position:0%
directed to establish those in
 
02:06:27.910 --> 02:06:27.920 align:start position:0%
administrative role so if the rule
 
02:06:29.830 --> 02:06:29.840 align:start position:0%
expires well then there's no authority
 
02:06:32.470 --> 02:06:32.480 align:start position:0%
to collect those fines and fees and um
 
02:06:35.629 --> 02:06:35.639 align:start position:0%
Dr Mor is correct in that oplc actually
 
02:06:37.990 --> 02:06:38.000 align:start position:0%
goes you know beyond you know what we
 
02:06:40.510 --> 02:06:40.520 align:start position:0%
normally see by the agencies and that
 
02:06:43.950 --> 02:06:43.960 align:start position:0%
they often do come prepared to discuss
 
02:06:47.510 --> 02:06:47.520 align:start position:0%
that enforcement and um then they also
 
02:06:50.229 --> 02:06:50.239 align:start position:0%
you know already go ahead and refund so
 
02:06:52.069 --> 02:06:52.079 align:start position:0%
so we were thinking that the impact
 
02:06:54.109 --> 02:06:54.119 align:start position:0%
might be minimal but we don't know and
 
02:06:56.149 --> 02:06:56.159 align:start position:0%
like director moral said um there could
 
02:06:58.310 --> 02:06:58.320 align:start position:0%
be a better way to go about this but
 
02:07:01.270 --> 02:07:01.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:04.549 --> 02:07:04.559 align:start position:0%
recommended sounds fair representative
 
02:07:08.189 --> 02:07:08.199 align:start position:0%
schi thank you madam chair for uh there
 
02:07:11.510 --> 02:07:11.520 align:start position:0%
are several of of course as you know are
 
02:07:14.830 --> 02:07:14.840 align:start position:0%
on the jela car currently um but for
 
02:07:16.709 --> 02:07:16.719 align:start position:0%
members of the public or other people
 
02:07:19.790 --> 02:07:19.800 align:start position:0%
who are not at the jail car meetings uh
 
02:07:22.790 --> 02:07:22.800 align:start position:0%
on a regular basis uh the the reality is
 
02:07:25.629 --> 02:07:25.639 align:start position:0%
that this expired rule situation is one
 
02:07:29.830 --> 02:07:29.840 align:start position:0%
that is very meticulously uh adhered to
 
02:07:33.510 --> 02:07:33.520 align:start position:0%
uh with regard to jel car meetings when
 
02:07:36.430 --> 02:07:36.440 align:start position:0%
an item comes up that relates to an
 
02:07:41.069 --> 02:07:41.079 align:start position:0%
expired rule uh it is it is meticulously
 
02:07:44.390 --> 02:07:44.400 align:start position:0%
reported on it in in every instance uh
 
02:07:47.270 --> 02:07:47.280 align:start position:0%
and the chair generally questions uh
 
02:07:49.189 --> 02:07:49.199 align:start position:0%
what the what the agent agcy has been
 
02:07:53.470 --> 02:07:53.480 align:start position:0%
doing on on this Rule and the report is
 
02:07:56.069 --> 02:07:56.079 align:start position:0%
that we haven't been enforcing it and
 
02:07:58.470 --> 02:07:58.480 align:start position:0%
and and and it's I just want to make
 
02:08:00.910 --> 02:08:00.920 align:start position:0%
sure that everybody that's not there on
 
02:08:03.709 --> 02:08:03.719 align:start position:0%
a regular basis knows that that this is
 
02:08:07.350 --> 02:08:07.360 align:start position:0%
being adhered to very
 
02:08:10.470 --> 02:08:10.480 align:start position:0%
very meticulous is the right word very
 
02:08:12.589 --> 02:08:12.599 align:start position:0%
meticulously because we take it
 
02:08:16.390 --> 02:08:16.400 align:start position:0%
seriously that an expired rule is not a
 
02:08:19.069 --> 02:08:19.079 align:start position:0%
rule it's a null
 
02:08:19.079 --> 02:08:23.270 align:start position:0%
rule it's a null
thank

02:08:23.270 --> 02:08:23.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:26.510 --> 02:08:26.520 align:start position:0%
you any other comments thank you very
 
02:08:30.310 --> 02:08:30.320 align:start position:0%
much for your input um so at this point
 
02:08:32.830 --> 02:08:32.840 align:start position:0%
I would ask representative Maguire as
 
02:08:36.629 --> 02:08:36.639 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor and the uh purported
 
02:08:38.229 --> 02:08:38.239 align:start position:0%
sponsor of the amendment if you'd be
 
02:08:41.589 --> 02:08:41.599 align:start position:0%
willing to redraft your Amendment um
 
02:08:44.229 --> 02:08:44.239 align:start position:0%
it'll obviously take a renumbering with
 
02:08:47.189 --> 02:08:47.199 align:start position:0%
the deletion of section one uh would you
 
02:08:50.549 --> 02:08:50.559 align:start position:0%
be willing to take that that
 
02:08:53.589 --> 02:08:53.599 align:start position:0%
on the revised Amendment will delete
 
02:08:53.599 --> 02:08:55.470 align:start position:0%
on the revised Amendment will delete
section

02:08:55.470 --> 02:08:55.480 align:start position:0%
section
 
02:08:58.870 --> 02:08:58.880 align:start position:0%
one reward section two slightly to
 
02:09:00.390 --> 02:09:00.400 align:start position:0%
Simply say all
 
02:09:03.990 --> 02:09:04.000 align:start position:0%
licenses and I think that's the only
 
02:09:07.990 --> 02:09:08.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:12.189 --> 02:09:12.199 align:start position:0%
change okay and then um I that require
 
02:09:14.390 --> 02:09:14.400 align:start position:0%
ruming of the rest of your Amendment
 
02:09:16.589 --> 02:09:16.599 align:start position:0%
thank you very much yeah we'll we'll do
 
02:09:20.350 --> 02:09:20.360 align:start position:0%
it that way okay yes I I can do that
 
02:09:20.360 --> 02:09:21.229 align:start position:0%
it that way okay yes I I can do that
thank

02:09:21.229 --> 02:09:21.239 align:start position:0%
thank
 
02:09:27.830 --> 02:09:27.840 align:start position:0%
you um is that all um okay I don't think
 
02:09:29.870 --> 02:09:29.880 align:start position:0%
we can actually vote on the amendment at
 
02:09:32.790 --> 02:09:32.800 align:start position:0%
this point but um does the subcommittee
 
02:09:35.549 --> 02:09:35.559 align:start position:0%
feel that we need to take a vote on the
 
02:09:37.310 --> 02:09:37.320 align:start position:0%
amendment or are you okay with just
 
02:09:40.950 --> 02:09:40.960 align:start position:0%
presenting it uh at the next
 
02:09:43.510 --> 02:09:43.520 align:start position:0%
exec I
 
02:09:46.270 --> 02:09:46.280 align:start position:0%
think I think if we have the amendment
 
02:09:48.350 --> 02:09:48.360 align:start position:0%
we can meet just prior to when we EX
 
02:09:51.229 --> 02:09:51.239 align:start position:0%
second and do a quick vote to make it
 
02:09:54.189 --> 02:09:54.199 align:start position:0%
official okay yeah I'm good with that I
 
02:09:56.830 --> 02:09:56.840 align:start position:0%
will distribute the amendment okay to
 
02:09:58.589 --> 02:09:58.599 align:start position:0%
the sub committee as soon as I get it
 
02:10:02.870 --> 02:10:02.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:06.350 --> 02:10:06.360 align:start position:0%
you do I have a motion to
 
02:10:09.870 --> 02:10:09.880 align:start position:0%
adjourn thank you second second thank
 
02:10:12.629 --> 02:10:12.639 align:start position:0%
you all for your attendance and uh for
 
02:10:14.350 --> 02:10:14.360 align:start position:0%
your important
 
02:10:17.910 --> 02:10:17.920 align:start position:0%
submissions so there will be an exact
 
02:10:21.470 --> 02:10:21.480 align:start position:0%
session starting at 1:30 we'll have a
 
02:10:25.069 --> 02:10:25.079 align:start position:0%
republican caucus in here at 1 I presume
 
02:10:26.549 --> 02:10:26.559 align:start position:0%
there will be a Democrat Caucus
 
02:10:26.559 --> 02:10:27.589 align:start position:0%
there will be a Democrat Caucus
somewhere

02:10:27.589 --> 02:10:27.599 align:start position:0%
somewhere
 
02:10:30.549 --> 02:10:30.559 align:start position:0%
else um I'm I'm just asking too do you
 
02:10:33.310 --> 02:10:33.320 align:start position:0%
have an idea what time the exec is going

okay so I'd like to start with House
 
04:01:48.319 --> 04:01:50.590 align:start position:0%
okay so I'd like to start with House
Bill

04:01:50.590 --> 04:01:50.600 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
04:01:54.590 --> 04:01:54.600 align:start position:0%
1387 on the State Building Code and I
 
04:01:58.510 --> 04:01:58.520 align:start position:0%
move ought to pass and present
 
04:02:04.389 --> 04:02:04.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:04.399 --> 04:02:07.149 align:start position:0%
 
H

04:02:07.149 --> 04:02:07.159 align:start position:0%
H
 
04:02:07.159 --> 04:02:10.590 align:start position:0%
H
second

04:02:10.590 --> 04:02:10.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:12.710 --> 04:02:12.720 align:start position:0%
you should it was passed
 
04:02:24.870 --> 04:02:24.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:28.429 --> 04:02:28.439 align:start position:0%
one we wouldn't want that to happen to
 
04:02:35.630 --> 04:02:35.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:39.590 --> 04:02:39.600 align:start position:0%
the all right so I I'll mentioned this
 
04:02:42.189 --> 04:02:42.199 align:start position:0%
amendment simply
 
04:02:47.110 --> 04:02:47.120 align:start position:0%
changes the timing for uh when the
 
04:02:50.670 --> 04:02:50.680 align:start position:0%
building code review board updates a
 
04:02:52.670 --> 04:02:52.680 align:start position:0%
starts review of a
 
04:02:57.510 --> 04:02:57.520 align:start position:0%
code it was set at two years and this
 
04:03:00.389 --> 04:03:00.399 align:start position:0%
amendment makes it one year because we
 
04:03:03.830 --> 04:03:03.840 align:start position:0%
now require legislative confirmation of
 
04:03:06.429 --> 04:03:06.439 align:start position:0%
the changes before they go into effect
 
04:03:09.070 --> 04:03:09.080 align:start position:0%
so this is wait a year have it reviewed
 
04:03:12.030 --> 04:03:12.040 align:start position:0%
and then have it approved by the
 
04:03:13.990 --> 04:03:14.000 align:start position:0%
legislation and it's going to be at
 
04:03:15.710 --> 04:03:15.720 align:start position:0%
least two years before you get through
 
04:03:19.630 --> 04:03:19.640 align:start position:0%
that process so this simply allows the
 
04:03:21.670 --> 04:03:21.680 align:start position:0%
board to start their review a little
 
04:03:26.030 --> 04:03:26.040 align:start position:0%
sooner on some of them uh it it is
 
04:03:28.269 --> 04:03:28.279 align:start position:0%
essentially the same effect as as
 
04:03:30.910 --> 04:03:30.920 align:start position:0%
current law and I hope you will support
 
04:03:32.710 --> 04:03:32.720 align:start position:0%
it representative
 
04:03:35.189 --> 04:03:35.199 align:start position:0%
 I think well said and I think that
 
04:03:37.790 --> 04:03:37.800 align:start position:0%
was actually asked for too by the board
 
04:03:42.030 --> 04:03:42.040 align:start position:0%
as well 12 you're right it
 
04:03:46.030 --> 04:03:46.040 align:start position:0%
was yes Madam chair yes I'll just add as
 
04:03:48.389 --> 04:03:48.399 align:start position:0%
chair of the subcommittee this was
 
04:03:51.670 --> 04:03:51.680 align:start position:0%
requested by the board and very simple
 
04:03:53.950 --> 04:03:53.960 align:start position:0%
change the committee was in agreement
 
04:03:55.990 --> 04:03:56.000 align:start position:0%
but we did not have the amendment before
 
04:03:59.950 --> 04:03:59.960 align:start position:0%
us so the subcommittee is in favor of it
 
04:04:03.389 --> 04:04:03.399 align:start position:0%
but we did not vote on it thank you okay
 
04:04:05.189 --> 04:04:05.199 align:start position:0%
anyone else have comments questions
 
04:04:06.990 --> 04:04:07.000 align:start position:0%
about the
 
04:04:07.000 --> 04:04:09.189 align:start position:0%
about the
amendment

04:04:09.189 --> 04:04:09.199 align:start position:0%

thank you madam uh speak Madam speaker
 
04:07:14.149 --> 04:07:14.159 align:start position:0%
sorry Madame chair um this makes more
 
04:07:17.309 --> 04:07:17.319 align:start position:0%
sense not to do it right now with uh all
 
04:07:21.389 --> 04:07:21.399 align:start position:0%
the um Podiatry meets once in three
 
04:07:24.149 --> 04:07:24.159 align:start position:0%
months there's and the Board of Medicine
 
04:07:28.790 --> 04:07:28.800 align:start position:0%
meets every month so to add more to the
 
04:07:32.189 --> 04:07:32.199 align:start position:0%
podiatric U member of the board to meet
 
04:07:35.750 --> 04:07:35.760 align:start position:0%
every month uh doesn't make sense and
 
04:07:39.070 --> 04:07:39.080 align:start position:0%
it's functioning well if it's in broken
 
04:07:42.349 --> 04:07:42.359 align:start position:0%
don't fix it so that's with that I say
 
04:07:44.109 --> 04:07:44.119 align:start position:0%
we don't
 
04:07:44.119 --> 04:07:46.990 align:start position:0%
we don't
merge

04:07:46.990 --> 04:07:47.000 align:start position:0%
merge
 
04:07:50.870 --> 04:07:50.880 align:start position:0%
okay likeus yeah um I agree the the
 
04:07:53.670 --> 04:07:53.680 align:start position:0%
other point is that um it's it's not
 
04:07:55.630 --> 04:07:55.640 align:start position:0%
clear they would uh fit together too
 
04:07:57.469 --> 04:07:57.479 align:start position:0%
well I mean the doctors the podiatrists
 
04:08:00.710 --> 04:08:00.720 align:start position:0%
are have some conflict um there is an
 
04:08:02.750 --> 04:08:02.760 align:start position:0%
issue that uh there aren't that many
 
04:08:05.349 --> 04:08:05.359 align:start position:0%
podiatrists so it is a a small
 
04:08:07.189 --> 04:08:07.199 align:start position:0%
profession it might make sense in the
 
04:08:09.070 --> 04:08:09.080 align:start position:0%
future to turn it into an Advisory board
 
04:08:10.349 --> 04:08:10.359 align:start position:0%
but doing the merger I don't think is
 
04:08:14.389 --> 04:08:14.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:18.269 --> 04:08:18.279 align:start position:0%
okay Schmid you have a comment no just I
 
04:08:20.990 --> 04:08:21.000 align:start position:0%
I agree that it's not appropriate to
 
04:08:24.349 --> 04:08:24.359 align:start position:0%
merge these two boards okay excellent
 
04:08:24.359 --> 04:08:26.510 align:start position:0%
merge these two boards okay excellent

04:09:07.990 --> 04:09:08.000 align:start position:0%
representative Smith yes representative
 
04:09:14.229 --> 04:09:14.239 align:start position:0%
M JY yes and the chair yes 20 a0 a okay
 
04:09:16.510 --> 04:09:16.520 align:start position:0%
any objections to
 
04:09:18.790 --> 04:09:18.800 align:start position:0%
consent okay seeing none we'll put that
 
04:09:21.389 --> 04:09:21.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:23.790 --> 04:09:23.800 align:start position:0%
consent all right and I'm going to move
 
04:09:27.750 --> 04:09:27.760 align:start position:0%
in expedient to legislate on House Bill
 
04:09:29.870 --> 04:09:29.880 align:start position:0%
1190 is there a
 
04:09:33.670 --> 04:09:33.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:33.680 --> 04:09:35.870 align:start position:0%
 
second

04:09:35.870 --> 04:09:35.880 align:start position:0%
second
 
04:09:39.429 --> 04:09:39.439 align:start position:0%
and this is the interstate social work
 
04:09:43.070 --> 04:09:43.080 align:start position:0%
licensure compact it's well-intentioned
 
04:09:46.149 --> 04:09:46.159 align:start position:0%
but I'm convinced it's unconstitutional
 
04:09:48.309 --> 04:09:48.319 align:start position:0%
and therefore I I can't recommend it and
 
04:09:52.750 --> 04:09:52.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:55.469 --> 04:09:55.479 align:start position:0%
Simon um yeah for those reasons I also
 
04:09:58.710 --> 04:09:58.720 align:start position:0%
had some um some concerns about uh the
 
04:10:01.109 --> 04:10:01.119 align:start position:0%
Dynamics that might uh create state to
 
04:10:04.189 --> 04:10:04.199 align:start position:0%
state um and it didn't seem like it was
 
04:10:06.189 --> 04:10:06.199 align:start position:0%
going to help some of the concerns that
 
04:10:07.670 --> 04:10:07.680 align:start position:0%
were being brought for by the soci
 
04:10:10.269 --> 04:10:10.279 align:start position:0%
workers as well um I I just as a general
 
04:10:11.510 --> 04:10:11.520 align:start position:0%
rule I
 
04:10:14.389 --> 04:10:14.399 align:start position:0%
have a problem setting up these quas
 
04:10:16.590 --> 04:10:16.600 align:start position:0%
governmental agencies that have the
 
04:10:18.950 --> 04:10:18.960 align:start position:0%
power to somewhat oversee themselves uh
 
04:10:20.429 --> 04:10:20.439 align:start position:0%
and the fact that they could pass a law
 
04:10:21.710 --> 04:10:21.720 align:start position:0%
that's binding on the state of New
 
04:10:23.710 --> 04:10:23.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh that we would have to be
 
04:10:25.429 --> 04:10:25.439 align:start position:0%
reactionary to that we wouldn't have say
 
04:10:26.870 --> 04:10:26.880 align:start position:0%
on that before it went into effect but
 
04:10:28.790 --> 04:10:28.800 align:start position:0%
we'd have to react to it uh to me I
 
04:10:31.389 --> 04:10:31.399 align:start position:0%
think is also unconstitutional so um for
 
04:10:33.070 --> 04:10:33.080 align:start position:0%
those reasons I I can't support it I I
 
04:10:35.309 --> 04:10:35.319 align:start position:0%
agree though I I the concept is fine but
 
04:10:37.790 --> 04:10:37.800 align:start position:0%
I can't agree with the compact itself
 
04:10:41.950 --> 04:10:41.960 align:start position:0%
all right anyone else representative
 
04:10:45.830 --> 04:10:45.840 align:start position:0%
manuti I will not be open uh voting itl
 
04:10:49.229 --> 04:10:49.239 align:start position:0%
on this I think it's a critical piece at
 
04:10:51.790 --> 04:10:51.800 align:start position:0%
this point when you're facing so much um
 
04:10:54.309 --> 04:10:54.319 align:start position:0%
shortage with the mental health
 
04:10:58.990 --> 04:10:59.000 align:start position:0%
providers and uh uh it's before the
 
04:11:01.149 --> 04:11:01.159 align:start position:0%
covid itself we had the Mental Health
 
04:11:05.830 --> 04:11:05.840 align:start position:0%
crisis and it was overshadowed by the
 
04:11:08.910 --> 04:11:08.920 align:start position:0%
pandemic and now you know we are facing
 
04:11:13.469 --> 04:11:13.479 align:start position:0%
it even more so to say this is not it's
 
04:11:15.590 --> 04:11:15.600 align:start position:0%
not the answer for everything but at
 
04:11:18.950 --> 04:11:18.960 align:start position:0%
least it is the right one of the tools
 
04:11:21.790 --> 04:11:21.800 align:start position:0%
that can be in the toolbox for mental
 
04:11:25.389 --> 04:11:25.399 align:start position:0%
health providers so I cannot support the
 
04:11:28.830 --> 04:11:28.840 align:start position:0%
itl this okay representative leus I
 
04:11:31.670 --> 04:11:31.680 align:start position:0%
agree with uh with the other person made
 
04:11:33.830 --> 04:11:33.840 align:start position:0%
the motion and seconded the other only
 
04:11:37.109 --> 04:11:37.119 align:start position:0%
thing I'd say is that um I mean it's too
 
04:11:38.670 --> 04:11:38.680 align:start position:0%
bad it structured this way if it was
 
04:11:41.710 --> 04:11:41.720 align:start position:0%
done in a way that the the board of the
 
04:11:43.670 --> 04:11:43.680 align:start position:0%
compact could propose rules but they
 
04:11:46.030 --> 04:11:46.040 align:start position:0%
would not go into effect until ratified
 
04:11:48.109 --> 04:11:48.119 align:start position:0%
by the legislator legislators that
 
04:11:50.269 --> 04:11:50.279 align:start position:0%
wanted to or the states that wanted to I
 
04:11:52.870 --> 04:11:52.880 align:start position:0%
would have been fine with this okay
 
04:11:56.269 --> 04:11:56.279 align:start position:0%
anyone else representative
 
04:12:00.510 --> 04:12:00.520 align:start position:0%
Smith thank you madam chair just a a
 
04:12:03.630 --> 04:12:03.640 align:start position:0%
thought um right now we do have critical
 
04:12:05.550 --> 04:12:05.560 align:start position:0%
shortages in the areas that we're
 
04:12:09.870 --> 04:12:09.880 align:start position:0%
talking about this be Ed could there be
 
04:12:13.469 --> 04:12:13.479 align:start position:0%
a set time for this to work and then it
 
04:12:15.630 --> 04:12:15.640 align:start position:0%
has to be relooked at and at that point
 
04:12:17.990 --> 04:12:18.000 align:start position:0%
could be it or tabled or whatever and
 
04:12:21.269 --> 04:12:21.279 align:start position:0%
not go any further could could we set a
 
04:12:24.790 --> 04:12:24.800 align:start position:0%
time on this can unfortunately it has to
 
04:12:27.429 --> 04:12:27.439 align:start position:0%
be voted out of this committee by the
 
04:12:31.269 --> 04:12:31.279 align:start position:0%
end of the month and this isn't quite at
 
04:12:33.910 --> 04:12:33.920 align:start position:0%
the deadline but it's not far from it
 
04:12:37.229 --> 04:12:37.239 align:start position:0%
okay and the other point is that a
 
04:12:40.309 --> 04:12:40.319 align:start position:0%
feature of these compacts is that every
 
04:12:42.309 --> 04:12:42.319 align:start position:0%
state has to adopt the exact same
 
04:12:45.830 --> 04:12:45.840 align:start position:0%
language we can't modify it okay all
 
04:12:49.469 --> 04:12:49.479 align:start position:0%
right thank you okay represent
 
04:12:51.830 --> 04:12:51.840 align:start position:0%
goalie thank you madam chair and I too
 
04:12:54.990 --> 04:12:55.000 align:start position:0%
will support the itl um one of the main
 
04:12:56.950 --> 04:12:56.960 align:start position:0%
reasons like you said is boilerplate
 
04:12:58.910 --> 04:12:58.920 align:start position:0%
language I don't think we should have to
 
04:13:04.030 --> 04:13:04.040 align:start position:0%
follow that and be held to it um second
 
04:13:08.550 --> 04:13:08.560 align:start position:0%
is when we heard in testimony from
 
04:13:11.109 --> 04:13:11.119 align:start position:0%
all the social workers that they'd be
 
04:13:12.590 --> 04:13:12.600 align:start position:0%
able to follow
 
04:13:16.349 --> 04:13:16.359 align:start position:0%
their patients from state to state um we
 
04:13:18.469 --> 04:13:18.479 align:start position:0%
heard in testimony only Missouri and
 
04:13:22.510 --> 04:13:22.520 align:start position:0%
South Dakota have enacted legislation so
 
04:13:25.510 --> 04:13:25.520 align:start position:0%
far so they would not be able to follow
 
04:13:28.269 --> 04:13:28.279 align:start position:0%
from state to state unless another state
 
04:13:32.349 --> 04:13:32.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:34.950 --> 04:13:34.960 align:start position:0%
compact another reason for this
 
04:13:38.830 --> 04:13:38.840 align:start position:0%
is the compact has not yet formed and
 
04:13:41.830 --> 04:13:41.840 align:start position:0%
until the compact forms and puts its
 
04:13:43.429 --> 04:13:43.439 align:start position:0%
rules in
 
04:13:46.950 --> 04:13:46.960 align:start position:0%
place I think it's not appropriate for
 
04:13:49.349 --> 04:13:49.359 align:start position:0%
the Hampshire to jump into that compact
 
04:13:51.630 --> 04:13:51.640 align:start position:0%
not knowing what the rules
 
04:13:54.229 --> 04:13:54.239 align:start position:0%
are when the compact is formed and the
 
04:13:56.349 --> 04:13:56.359 align:start position:0%
rules are in place then we can look at
 
04:13:58.469 --> 04:13:58.479 align:start position:0%
it we can go forward but I don't think
 
04:14:00.189 --> 04:14:00.199 align:start position:0%
it's fair for everyone to come here
 
04:14:02.550 --> 04:14:02.560 align:start position:0%
saying we should jump into a compact as
 
04:14:04.189 --> 04:14:04.199 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire not knowing
 
04:14:04.199 --> 04:14:05.510 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire not knowing
those

04:14:05.510 --> 04:14:05.520 align:start position:0%
those
 
04:14:08.229 --> 04:14:08.239 align:start position:0%
rules so for that reason and until it's
 
04:14:11.070 --> 04:14:11.080 align:start position:0%
formed I I I cannot support this and for
 
04:14:13.070 --> 04:14:13.080 align:start position:0%
one other reason and which is
 
04:14:15.790 --> 04:14:15.800 align:start position:0%
unfortunate in this boilerplate language
 
04:14:17.550 --> 04:14:17.560 align:start position:0%
one of my big sticking points Still
 
04:14:18.870 --> 04:14:18.880 align:start position:0%
Remains just like in all the other
 
04:14:21.750 --> 04:14:21.760 align:start position:0%
compacts I voted against is the ability
 
04:14:25.269 --> 04:14:25.279 align:start position:0%
to lease purchase retain own hold
 
04:14:27.229 --> 04:14:27.239 align:start position:0%
improve or use any property real
 
04:14:30.229 --> 04:14:30.239 align:start position:0%
personal or mixed sell convey mortgage
 
04:14:32.830 --> 04:14:32.840 align:start position:0%
pledge lease exchange abandoned
 
04:14:34.349 --> 04:14:34.359 align:start position:0%
otherwise dispose of property or
 
04:14:37.070 --> 04:14:37.080 align:start position:0%
personal mixed um for those Reasons I'm
 
04:14:40.109 --> 04:14:40.119 align:start position:0%
I mean in a compact until that
 
04:14:42.030 --> 04:14:42.040 align:start position:0%
boilerplate language is removed I mean
 
04:14:43.670 --> 04:14:43.680 align:start position:0%
we're signing up for something we don't
 
04:14:45.030 --> 04:14:45.040 align:start position:0%
even know what kind of property we're
 
04:14:48.630 --> 04:14:48.640 align:start position:0%
talking about purchasing thank you okay
 
04:14:49.950 --> 04:14:49.960 align:start position:0%
and represent
 
04:14:53.269 --> 04:14:53.279 align:start position:0%
BR so as you can see there's a lot of
 
04:14:53.279 --> 04:14:54.229 align:start position:0%
BR so as you can see there's a lot of
mixed

04:14:54.229 --> 04:14:54.239 align:start position:0%
mixed
 
04:14:57.229 --> 04:14:57.239 align:start position:0%
feelings on this issue but I'll be
 
04:15:00.510 --> 04:15:00.520 align:start position:0%
voting against the itl because joing the
 
04:15:03.229 --> 04:15:03.239 align:start position:0%
compact allows New Hampshire to be part
 
04:15:06.429 --> 04:15:06.439 align:start position:0%
of that rul making process and to be
 
04:15:09.189 --> 04:15:09.199 align:start position:0%
part of that and if it chooses at one
 
04:15:12.590 --> 04:15:12.600 align:start position:0%
point not to belong to the compact it
 
04:15:16.950 --> 04:15:16.960 align:start position:0%
can withdraw at any time so for me um
 
04:15:19.510 --> 04:15:19.520 align:start position:0%
it's I'm I'm I'm going to be supporting
 
04:15:22.870 --> 04:15:22.880 align:start position:0%
the I won't be supporting the itl but
 
04:15:24.550 --> 04:15:24.560 align:start position:0%
I'm sure that it will be supported by
 
04:15:26.910 --> 04:15:26.920 align:start position:0%
the committee and it is what it is and
 
04:15:28.950 --> 04:15:28.960 align:start position:0%
people should vote their
 
04:15:32.349 --> 04:15:32.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:34.389 --> 04:15:34.399 align:start position:0%
right all
 
04:15:38.710 --> 04:15:38.720 align:start position:0%
right man thank you Madam chair I also
 
04:15:41.590 --> 04:15:41.600 align:start position:0%
want to bring to the attention compact
 
04:15:43.109 --> 04:15:43.119 align:start position:0%
yes once it's
 
04:15:47.030 --> 04:15:47.040 align:start position:0%
formed then it's not the core group
 
04:15:50.149 --> 04:15:50.159 align:start position:0%
that's making the rule and setting the
 
04:15:53.429 --> 04:15:53.439 align:start position:0%
compact up so if you want to be at the
 
04:15:57.510 --> 04:15:57.520 align:start position:0%
table making or shaping this compact the
 
04:16:02.070 --> 04:16:02.080 align:start position:0%
time is now I think and that's why I
 
04:16:06.910 --> 04:16:06.920 align:start position:0%
cannot support the idea okay fair enough
 
04:16:08.630 --> 04:16:08.640 align:start position:0%
reprentative Brown and then
 
04:16:11.790 --> 04:16:11.800 align:start position:0%
Simon thank you madam chair I I I would
 
04:16:14.469 --> 04:16:14.479 align:start position:0%
Echo uh what representative goalie said
 
04:16:17.469 --> 04:16:17.479 align:start position:0%
to my right and follow up on
 
04:16:19.429 --> 04:16:19.439 align:start position:0%
representative grod I think the
 
04:16:22.389 --> 04:16:22.399 align:start position:0%
withdrawal has to be done
 
04:16:25.109 --> 04:16:25.119 align:start position:0%
legislatively here at at the house and
 
04:16:28.309 --> 04:16:28.319 align:start position:0%
it says 180 days after the enactment of
 
04:16:30.469 --> 04:16:30.479 align:start position:0%
the repealing statute is how long it
 
04:16:32.830 --> 04:16:32.840 align:start position:0%
takes to withdraw so I think that's kind
 
04:16:36.630 --> 04:16:36.640 align:start position:0%
of a long time okay representative Simon
 
04:16:38.950 --> 04:16:38.960 align:start position:0%
and then gold thank you madam chair uh
 
04:16:41.630 --> 04:16:41.640 align:start position:0%
yes to representative mana's Point um I
 
04:16:43.670 --> 04:16:43.680 align:start position:0%
understand the point that's being made
 
04:16:46.189 --> 04:16:46.199 align:start position:0%
um however my concern would be just
 
04:16:47.750 --> 04:16:47.760 align:start position:0%
being at the table to be able to set the
 
04:16:50.750 --> 04:16:50.760 align:start position:0%
rules does not mean that we would get
 
04:16:52.590 --> 04:16:52.600 align:start position:0%
the rules that we want we could have
 
04:16:54.429 --> 04:16:54.439 align:start position:0%
input into them but we could be outvoted
 
04:16:56.149 --> 04:16:56.159 align:start position:0%
by the other people who are in charge
 
04:16:57.870 --> 04:16:57.880 align:start position:0%
and then we would be committed to the
 
04:17:01.950 --> 04:17:01.960 align:start position:0%
compact at that point um without knowing
 
04:17:03.109 --> 04:17:03.119 align:start position:0%
what those rules are going to be and
 
04:17:04.309 --> 04:17:04.319 align:start position:0%
what they look like to representative
 
04:17:06.030 --> 04:17:06.040 align:start position:0%
Goldie's point so I would I would still
 
04:17:07.670 --> 04:17:07.680 align:start position:0%
have a bit of a concern
 
04:17:09.030 --> 04:17:09.040 align:start position:0%
um with that even though we would be at
 
04:17:11.990 --> 04:17:12.000 align:start position:0%
the table represent
 
04:17:14.349 --> 04:17:14.359 align:start position:0%
gold clearly we have some division in
 
04:17:15.990 --> 04:17:16.000 align:start position:0%
the committee on this one we can't all
 
04:17:18.189 --> 04:17:18.199 align:start position:0%
agree on everything um having heard all
 
04:17:21.429 --> 04:17:21.439 align:start position:0%
the testimony and having gotten so many
 
04:17:23.630 --> 04:17:23.640 align:start position:0%
um Communications from social workers
 
04:17:25.950 --> 04:17:25.960 align:start position:0%
supporting this knowing the crisis we
 
04:17:28.710 --> 04:17:28.720 align:start position:0%
have in our state and knowing that 180
 
04:17:30.710 --> 04:17:30.720 align:start position:0%
days to withdraw isn't the end of the
 
04:17:34.510 --> 04:17:34.520 align:start position:0%
world and um a compact is not likely to
 
04:17:36.910 --> 04:17:36.920 align:start position:0%
do anything that would be harming to the
 
04:17:39.910 --> 04:17:39.920 align:start position:0%
public in those 180 days and knowing
 
04:17:42.109 --> 04:17:42.119 align:start position:0%
that the office of professional licenser
 
04:17:44.349 --> 04:17:44.359 align:start position:0%
supports this I it just is a no-brainer
 
04:17:47.389 --> 04:17:47.399 align:start position:0%
for me I'll be not voting
 
04:17:50.070 --> 04:17:50.080 align:start position:0%
itl anyone
 
04:17:53.389 --> 04:17:53.399 align:start position:0%

04:19:45.389 --> 04:19:45.399 align:start position:0%

04:19:48.670 --> 04:19:48.680 align:start position:0%
second second second representative G
 
04:19:48.680 --> 04:19:50.790 align:start position:0%
second second second representative G
was

04:19:50.790 --> 04:19:50.800 align:start position:0%
was
 
04:19:54.189 --> 04:19:54.199 align:start position:0%
first all right do to speak to your
 
04:19:57.990 --> 04:19:58.000 align:start position:0%
motion yes the subcommittee met and we
 
04:20:01.630 --> 04:20:01.640 align:start position:0%
did have an amendment that would have
 
04:20:07.990 --> 04:20:08.000 align:start position:0%
changed the bill from a requirement to a
 
04:20:14.750 --> 04:20:14.760 align:start position:0%
data Gathering um position within um da
 
04:20:15.990 --> 04:20:16.000 align:start position:0%
within the the
 
04:20:16.000 --> 04:20:18.229 align:start position:0%
within the the
department

04:20:18.229 --> 04:20:18.239 align:start position:0%
department
 
04:20:21.189 --> 04:20:21.199 align:start position:0%
and when we spoke to Mr Arling house he
 
04:20:23.429 --> 04:20:23.439 align:start position:0%
didn't have a method to do that but he
 
04:20:26.070 --> 04:20:26.080 align:start position:0%
was certainly willing to discuss
 
04:20:29.389 --> 04:20:29.399 align:start position:0%
it and after the emails that we received
 
04:20:32.469 --> 04:20:32.479 align:start position:0%
recently which obviously seemed to
 
04:20:34.710 --> 04:20:34.720 align:start position:0%
misunderstand the whole purpose of what
 
04:20:36.950 --> 04:20:36.960 align:start position:0%
we were trying to do at this this point
 
04:20:39.030 --> 04:20:39.040 align:start position:0%
I think it's better if we just and I've
 
04:20:40.910 --> 04:20:40.920 align:start position:0%
spoken to the sponsor of the bill if we
 
04:20:43.630 --> 04:20:43.640 align:start position:0%
just um itl the bill and try a different
 
04:20:46.229 --> 04:20:46.239 align:start position:0%
way at a different
 
04:20:49.149 --> 04:20:49.159 align:start position:0%
time thank you representative gold no
 
04:20:52.790 --> 04:20:52.800 align:start position:0%
more to add to that representative
 
04:20:56.510 --> 04:20:56.520 align:start position:0%
Schmidt thank you madam chair well I I
 
04:20:59.389 --> 04:20:59.399 align:start position:0%
think one of the things is eminently
 
04:21:01.109 --> 04:21:01.119 align:start position:0%
clear with regard of the current
 
04:21:04.510 --> 04:21:04.520 align:start position:0%
situation is uh that this committee does
 
04:21:06.750 --> 04:21:06.760 align:start position:0%
not understand this bill of the this
 
04:21:11.429 --> 04:21:11.439 align:start position:0%
concept well enough uh to uh to make a
 
04:21:13.870 --> 04:21:13.880 align:start position:0%
contribution other than saying this
 
04:21:15.349 --> 04:21:15.359 align:start position:0%
doesn't seem to work so we're going to
 
04:21:17.429 --> 04:21:17.439 align:start position:0%
it out I'm not saying that's an
 
04:21:19.750 --> 04:21:19.760 align:start position:0%
irresponsible thing to do but I I think
 
04:21:22.830 --> 04:21:22.840 align:start position:0%
that the reality is that carbon pricing
 
04:21:27.189 --> 04:21:27.199 align:start position:0%
is coming to the world and and it's and
 
04:21:30.109 --> 04:21:30.119 align:start position:0%
it's and it's coming here as well it
 
04:21:32.070 --> 04:21:32.080 align:start position:0%
would be better to do it at the national
 
04:21:35.590 --> 04:21:35.600 align:start position:0%
level clearly uh but we we I think the
 
04:21:37.790 --> 04:21:37.800 align:start position:0%
correct uh better motion would be
 
04:21:40.429 --> 04:21:40.439 align:start position:0%
interim study so that we can get to
 
04:21:43.590 --> 04:21:43.600 align:start position:0%
understand the bill better thank
 
04:21:48.349 --> 04:21:48.359 align:start position:0%
you repr lus thank you um I agree with
 
04:21:50.229 --> 04:21:50.239 align:start position:0%
what's been said the the only thing I'd
 
04:21:53.750 --> 04:21:53.760 align:start position:0%
add is that um I you know trying to use
 
04:21:56.710 --> 04:21:56.720 align:start position:0%
the procurement process to achieve goals
 
04:21:59.510 --> 04:21:59.520 align:start position:0%
uh you know from any perspective is
 
04:22:00.910 --> 04:22:00.920 align:start position:0%
really not the best thing to do let's
 
04:22:02.990 --> 04:22:03.000 align:start position:0%
leave the like the retirement system
 
04:22:04.790 --> 04:22:04.800 align:start position:0%
let's leave the procurement process to
 
04:22:06.950 --> 04:22:06.960 align:start position:0%
try and get the best deal for
 
04:22:09.269 --> 04:22:09.279 align:start position:0%
the taxpayers of New Hampshire and if
 
04:22:12.469 --> 04:22:12.479 align:start position:0%
there's something that needs to be done
 
04:22:13.910 --> 04:22:13.920 align:start position:0%
uh in an area then that should be
 
04:22:15.870 --> 04:22:15.880 align:start position:0%
handled as a separate matter uh not
 
04:22:19.510 --> 04:22:19.520 align:start position:0%
enforced through procurement okay any
 
04:22:22.269 --> 04:22:22.279 align:start position:0%
anyone else represent Simon uh thank you
 
04:22:24.189 --> 04:22:24.199 align:start position:0%
madam chair I'll be supporting the itl
 
04:22:27.229 --> 04:22:27.239 align:start position:0%
but representative Schmidt's Point um
 
04:22:30.070 --> 04:22:30.080 align:start position:0%
I'll I will be voting itl understanding
 
04:22:31.990 --> 04:22:32.000 align:start position:0%
the the proposal and the concept of the
 
04:22:34.830 --> 04:22:34.840 align:start position:0%
bill uh but finding the methodology
 
04:22:38.590 --> 04:22:38.600 align:start position:0%
faulty uh it it mixes economic structure
 
04:22:43.510 --> 04:22:43.520 align:start position:0%
with social um with social sentiments um
 
04:22:44.710 --> 04:22:44.720 align:start position:0%
and when the social sentiment is
 
04:22:46.389 --> 04:22:46.399 align:start position:0%
basically the foundation of the model
 
04:22:49.710 --> 04:22:49.720 align:start position:0%
it's not a purely economic system so I I
 
04:22:51.550 --> 04:22:51.560 align:start position:0%
was unable to get anybody to explain to
 
04:22:52.710 --> 04:22:52.720 align:start position:0%
me how we were going to come out with
 
04:22:54.950 --> 04:22:54.960 align:start position:0%
any kind of accurate data or accurate
 
04:22:57.510 --> 04:22:57.520 align:start position:0%
information um and it was kind of like
 
04:23:00.229 --> 04:23:00.239 align:start position:0%
well some estimates better than nothing
 
04:23:02.030 --> 04:23:02.040 align:start position:0%
um but I don't necessarily think that's
 
04:23:03.429 --> 04:23:03.439 align:start position:0%
true I think if you make the estimate in
 
04:23:04.590 --> 04:23:04.600 align:start position:0%
the wrong direction you're going to get
 
04:23:05.870 --> 04:23:05.880 align:start position:0%
farther away from the truth and not
 
04:23:08.189 --> 04:23:08.199 align:start position:0%
closer to the truth and uh you could end
 
04:23:10.950 --> 04:23:10.960 align:start position:0%
up making very poor decisions that would
 
04:23:13.710 --> 04:23:13.720 align:start position:0%
have real implications for the state um
 
04:23:15.550 --> 04:23:15.560 align:start position:0%
so until we could come up with some sort
 
04:23:18.550 --> 04:23:18.560 align:start position:0%
of system that could accurately measure
 
04:23:20.269 --> 04:23:20.279 align:start position:0%
what the carbon cost would be I think it
 
04:23:22.149 --> 04:23:22.159 align:start position:0%
would be irresponsible on our part to to
 
04:23:24.349 --> 04:23:24.359 align:start position:0%
push a piece of legislation like this
 
04:23:29.510 --> 04:23:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:32.389 --> 04:23:32.399 align:start position:0%
else all right the motion is inexpedient
 
04:23:35.189 --> 04:23:35.199 align:start position:0%
to legislate on House Bill 1486 and the
 
04:23:37.229 --> 04:23:37.239 align:start position:0%

04:25:00.109 --> 04:25:00.119 align:start position:0%
H would you repeat that number for those
 
04:25:02.870 --> 04:25:02.880 align:start position:0%
of us with bad hearing uh
 
04:25:02.880 --> 04:25:04.910 align:start position:0%
of us with bad hearing uh
0850

04:25:04.910 --> 04:25:04.920 align:start position:0%
0850
 
04:25:07.389 --> 04:25:07.399 align:start position:0%
H and and it was handed out people
 
04:25:11.630 --> 04:25:11.640 align:start position:0%
should have it uh it's it's a thick one
 
04:25:12.830 --> 04:25:12.840 align:start position:0%
uh yeah it
 
04:25:15.710 --> 04:25:15.720 align:start position:0%
is okay yeah we had some fun with this
 
04:25:19.710 --> 04:25:19.720 align:start position:0%
one okay is there a second to
 
04:25:23.309 --> 04:25:23.319 align:start position:0%
that okay that's leus and ghoul do you
 
04:25:25.510 --> 04:25:25.520 align:start position:0%
wish to speak to your motion I do uh
 
04:25:26.710 --> 04:25:26.720 align:start position:0%
first I'd like to thank everybody in the
 
04:25:28.349 --> 04:25:28.359 align:start position:0%
subcommittee for doing an awful lot of
 
04:25:30.469 --> 04:25:30.479 align:start position:0%
work on this thing
 
04:25:30.479 --> 04:25:31.990 align:start position:0%
work on this thing
um

04:25:31.990 --> 04:25:32.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:25:34.790 --> 04:25:34.800 align:start position:0%
so make sure I
 
04:25:36.630 --> 04:25:36.640 align:start position:0%
am getting
 
04:25:38.670 --> 04:25:38.680 align:start position:0%
right okay so
 
04:25:41.670 --> 04:25:41.680 align:start position:0%
this uh bill was uh to convert a number
 
04:25:44.710 --> 04:25:44.720 align:start position:0%
of boards from uh regulatory to advisory
 
04:25:47.910 --> 04:25:47.920 align:start position:0%
boards and to combine a couple of boards
 
04:25:49.389 --> 04:25:49.399 align:start position:0%
and so first the
 
04:25:52.910 --> 04:25:52.920 align:start position:0%
combination was uh comine combining the
 
04:25:55.030 --> 04:25:55.040 align:start position:0%
r Advisory Board of massage therapists
 
04:25:57.790 --> 04:25:57.800 align:start position:0%
with The Advisory Board of reflexology
 
04:26:00.510 --> 04:26:00.520 align:start position:0%
structural integration agent body work
 
04:26:01.950 --> 04:26:01.960 align:start position:0%
and that was at the request of those
 
04:26:04.990 --> 04:26:05.000 align:start position:0%
boards um they they deal with some
 
04:26:09.229 --> 04:26:09.239 align:start position:0%
similar issues and uh and so that was
 
04:26:12.630 --> 04:26:12.640 align:start position:0%
what made sense um the rest of the
 
04:26:14.229 --> 04:26:14.239 align:start position:0%
boards that were converted to advisory
 
04:26:17.109 --> 04:26:17.119 align:start position:0%
boards were all boards that had um
 
04:26:20.630 --> 04:26:20.640 align:start position:0%
relatively few um lenses and so there
 
04:26:23.070 --> 04:26:23.080 align:start position:0%
were the usual concerns about a small
 
04:26:25.630 --> 04:26:25.640 align:start position:0%
number you know Market participants uh
 
04:26:28.109 --> 04:26:28.119 align:start position:0%
like you know regulating a small number
 
04:26:30.670 --> 04:26:30.680 align:start position:0%
of lenses and and there were antitrust
 
04:26:32.990 --> 04:26:33.000 align:start position:0%
and other concerns there uh we spent a
 
04:26:36.389 --> 04:26:36.399 align:start position:0%
lot of our time on was going through and
 
04:26:38.349 --> 04:26:38.359 align:start position:0%
closely examining the makeup of each one
 
04:26:40.269 --> 04:26:40.279 align:start position:0%
of the the proposed boards because I
 
04:26:42.189 --> 04:26:42.199 align:start position:0%
think when the bill was drafted it just
 
04:26:44.269 --> 04:26:44.279 align:start position:0%
hacked them all down to three and that
 
04:26:46.349 --> 04:26:46.359 align:start position:0%
didn't seem appropriate to us in all
 
04:26:49.429 --> 04:26:49.439 align:start position:0%
cases so uh we took a close look at that
 
04:26:51.309 --> 04:26:51.319 align:start position:0%
and then there were some general cleanup
 
04:26:53.830 --> 04:26:53.840 align:start position:0%
U similar things that uh have been dealt
 
04:26:56.590 --> 04:26:56.600 align:start position:0%
with in other bills um where there was
 
04:26:58.630 --> 04:26:58.640 align:start position:0%
Authority left with the board and oplc
 
04:27:01.469 --> 04:27:01.479 align:start position:0%
and some language changes uh in similar
 
04:27:03.349 --> 04:27:03.359 align:start position:0%
areas but that's that's the core of what
 
04:27:06.550 --> 04:27:06.560 align:start position:0%
H what we're doing and just one example
 
04:27:09.670 --> 04:27:09.680 align:start position:0%
um is the uh the board of Midwifery
 
04:27:12.389 --> 04:27:12.399 align:start position:0%
there's a total of 33 licensed midwives
 
04:27:15.469 --> 04:27:15.479 align:start position:0%
in the state um and you know the three
 
04:27:16.750 --> 04:27:16.760 align:start position:0%
that were on the
 
04:27:19.510 --> 04:27:19.520 align:start position:0%
board uh you know made up almost 10% of
 
04:27:21.710 --> 04:27:21.720 align:start position:0%
all the practicing midwives and that's
 
04:27:23.910 --> 04:27:23.920 align:start position:0%
problematic but we did look at that one
 
04:27:25.309 --> 04:27:25.319 align:start position:0%
and the you know the midwives were not
 
04:27:27.510 --> 04:27:27.520 align:start position:0%
happy with the proposed makeup to the
 
04:27:30.309 --> 04:27:30.319 align:start position:0%
board and we did expand it from three to
 
04:27:33.229 --> 04:27:33.239 align:start position:0%
five and uh added back in three midwives
 
04:27:34.710 --> 04:27:34.720 align:start position:0%
and two doctors in particular
 
04:27:37.309 --> 04:27:37.319 align:start position:0%
Specialties they wanted so so we did
 
04:27:39.590 --> 04:27:39.600 align:start position:0%
look at their
 
04:27:39.600 --> 04:27:41.229 align:start position:0%
look at their
concerns

04:27:41.229 --> 04:27:41.239 align:start position:0%
concerns
 
04:27:44.189 --> 04:27:44.199 align:start position:0%
okay representative
 
04:27:46.750 --> 04:27:46.760 align:start position:0%
gold um I would just add thank you madam
 
04:27:49.469 --> 04:27:49.479 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you uh Tony leus
 
04:27:51.309 --> 04:27:51.319 align:start position:0%
representative leus for all your work in
 
04:27:54.149 --> 04:27:54.159 align:start position:0%
leading Us in the committee work uh I
 
04:27:58.149 --> 04:27:58.159 align:start position:0%
know the Midwifery people were happy
 
04:28:00.229 --> 04:28:00.239 align:start position:0%
with some of the gains in the amendment
 
04:28:02.750 --> 04:28:02.760 align:start position:0%
I'll say so I think the committee worked
 
04:28:04.750 --> 04:28:04.760 align:start position:0%
really hard to try to listen to the
 
04:28:06.389 --> 04:28:06.399 align:start position:0%
concerns and
 
04:28:09.269 --> 04:28:09.279 align:start position:0%
find the most common ground and and
 
04:28:11.070 --> 04:28:11.080 align:start position:0%
touch a happy medium
 
04:28:14.950 --> 04:28:14.960 align:start position:0%
note so that's about all I
 
04:28:18.910 --> 04:28:18.920 align:start position:0%
said man thank you madam chair uh having
 
04:28:20.349 --> 04:28:20.359 align:start position:0%
served on the
 
04:28:23.590 --> 04:28:23.600 align:start position:0%
subcommittee um I still have concerns
 
04:28:23.600 --> 04:28:25.030 align:start position:0%
subcommittee um I still have concerns
about

04:28:25.030 --> 04:28:25.040 align:start position:0%
about
 
04:28:29.590 --> 04:28:29.600 align:start position:0%
um the transition of all the boards that
 
04:28:33.790 --> 04:28:33.800 align:start position:0%
are listed from
 
04:28:37.109 --> 04:28:37.119 align:start position:0%
um statutary board to
 
04:28:40.830 --> 04:28:40.840 align:start position:0%
advisory and um I agree moving in that
 
04:28:44.469 --> 04:28:44.479 align:start position:0%
direction but uh at still this time last
 
04:28:46.630 --> 04:28:46.640 align:start position:0%
year the whole changes that have
 
04:28:48.710 --> 04:28:48.720 align:start position:0%
happened that has not been implemented
 
04:28:52.670 --> 04:28:52.680 align:start position:0%
to make more changes on top of it um I
 
04:28:56.429 --> 04:28:56.439 align:start position:0%
am very skeptical about it so I do have
 
04:29:01.910 --> 04:29:01.920 align:start position:0%
a hard time supporting the otpa
 
04:29:05.429 --> 04:29:05.439 align:start position:0%
for I work I put in the hours with the
 
04:29:09.189 --> 04:29:09.199 align:start position:0%
sub committee and uh my question always
 
04:29:13.550 --> 04:29:13.560 align:start position:0%
lingered that so I still feel strongly
 
04:29:15.269 --> 04:29:15.279 align:start position:0%
that you're not there
 
04:29:15.279 --> 04:29:19.189 align:start position:0%
that you're not there
yet

04:29:19.189 --> 04:29:19.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:23.830 --> 04:29:23.840 align:start position:0%
okay having um spent my life in the last
 
04:29:26.830 --> 04:29:26.840 align:start position:0%
two weeks with the amendment to
 
04:29:29.870 --> 04:29:29.880 align:start position:0%
1095 I can tell you that the language in
 
04:29:33.389 --> 04:29:33.399 align:start position:0%
this bill conflicts with what we have in
 
04:29:37.429 --> 04:29:37.439 align:start position:0%
that um Amendment and
 
04:29:40.790 --> 04:29:40.800 align:start position:0%
so we need to take a look at
 
04:29:44.830 --> 04:29:44.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:50.750 --> 04:29:50.760 align:start position:0%
um I'm not even sure if I have the brain
 
04:29:54.630 --> 04:29:54.640 align:start position:0%
power right now to do it frankly so um I
 
04:29:57.429 --> 04:29:57.439 align:start position:0%
think that we need to align these before
 
04:30:01.149 --> 04:30:01.159 align:start position:0%
we accept it so maybe what we want to do
 
04:30:01.159 --> 04:30:01.990 align:start position:0%
we accept it so maybe what we want to do
is

04:30:01.990 --> 04:30:02.000 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:30:05.070 --> 04:30:05.080 align:start position:0%
spend the next week doing that since
 
04:30:08.510 --> 04:30:08.520 align:start position:0%
I'll be doing that with the amendment
 
04:30:11.429 --> 04:30:11.439 align:start position:0%
1095 I just don't want to have more
 
04:30:14.109 --> 04:30:14.119 align:start position:0%
problems I really I really appreciate
 
04:30:16.630 --> 04:30:16.640 align:start position:0%
that because that makes a lot of sense
 
04:30:18.950 --> 04:30:18.960 align:start position:0%
the other thing we could do is accept
 
04:30:21.229 --> 04:30:21.239 align:start position:0%
this amendment and then
 
04:30:24.790 --> 04:30:24.800 align:start position:0%
change 1095 which is already being
 
04:30:27.429 --> 04:30:27.439 align:start position:0%
changed all over the place to to include
 
04:30:31.670 --> 04:30:31.680 align:start position:0%
it but um or we
 
04:30:34.630 --> 04:30:34.640 align:start position:0%
can we can choose to work on the two of
 
04:30:37.349 --> 04:30:37.359 align:start position:0%
them together
 
04:30:41.309 --> 04:30:41.319 align:start position:0%
yes representative G and then yes I
 
04:30:45.269 --> 04:30:45.279 align:start position:0%
see thank you madam CH yes I know thank
 
04:30:48.469 --> 04:30:48.479 align:start position:0%
you madam chair and uh to representative
 
04:30:52.469 --> 04:30:52.479 align:start position:0%
groda um is is the difference the
 
04:30:54.750 --> 04:30:54.760 align:start position:0%
inconsistencies you're talking about
 
04:30:57.550 --> 04:30:57.560 align:start position:0%
regarding the authority to do things to
 
04:30:59.469 --> 04:30:59.479 align:start position:0%
the executive director versus the
 
04:31:02.590 --> 04:31:02.600 align:start position:0%
authority to do things to the
 
04:31:05.309 --> 04:31:05.319 align:start position:0%
office well that's one and I and this is
 
04:31:07.030 --> 04:31:07.040 align:start position:0%
the first time I've looked at this so I
 
04:31:09.189 --> 04:31:09.199 align:start position:0%
just want to make sure that I don't miss
 
04:31:12.030 --> 04:31:12.040 align:start position:0%
anything else but in all of the other
 
04:31:14.229 --> 04:31:14.239 align:start position:0%
legislation that we've looked at we have
 
04:31:17.990 --> 04:31:18.000 align:start position:0%
not used executive director we've used
 
04:31:25.309 --> 04:31:25.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:28.670 --> 04:31:28.680 align:start position:0%
um I just would like to have some I want
 
04:31:31.870 --> 04:31:31.880 align:start position:0%
like some Harmony to this
 
04:31:34.910 --> 04:31:34.920 align:start position:0%
because one of the issues that I'm that
 
04:31:38.229 --> 04:31:38.239 align:start position:0%
I I didn't have before but I have now is
 
04:31:41.269 --> 04:31:41.279 align:start position:0%
that when we touch something in oplc We
 
04:31:44.030 --> 04:31:44.040 align:start position:0%
Touch 25 other things that we don't even
 
04:31:45.469 --> 04:31:45.479 align:start position:0%
know we've
 
04:31:47.910 --> 04:31:47.920 align:start position:0%
affected and it is
 
04:31:50.389 --> 04:31:50.399 align:start position:0%
extremely difficult because then we end
 
04:31:53.349 --> 04:31:53.359 align:start position:0%
up with 122 pages that we have to
 
04:31:56.149 --> 04:31:56.159 align:start position:0%
literally go line by line word by word
 
04:31:57.630 --> 04:31:57.640 align:start position:0%
now maybe that's
 
04:32:00.389 --> 04:32:00.399 align:start position:0%
okay you know but when only one person
 
04:32:04.030 --> 04:32:04.040 align:start position:0%
is doing it or two people are doing it
 
04:32:06.590 --> 04:32:06.600 align:start position:0%
it's a heavy burden for that person on
 
04:32:09.149 --> 04:32:09.159 align:start position:0%
top of everything else that they do and
 
04:32:14.590 --> 04:32:14.600 align:start position:0%
I don't want to cause further GFF for
 
04:32:17.910 --> 04:32:17.920 align:start position:0%
the committee I want us to you know have
 
04:32:20.670 --> 04:32:20.680 align:start position:0%
a relationship that is I know I I know
 
04:32:22.870 --> 04:32:22.880 align:start position:0%
among our peers I under we are on the
 
04:32:25.349 --> 04:32:25.359 align:start position:0%
same page but to me our relationship
 
04:32:27.309 --> 04:32:27.319 align:start position:0%
with oplc our relationship with the
 
04:32:29.349 --> 04:32:29.359 align:start position:0%
office of legislative services our
 
04:32:31.109 --> 04:32:31.119 align:start position:0%
ability to speak about this coherently
 
04:32:34.429 --> 04:32:34.439 align:start position:0%
on the floor of the house are all
 
04:32:34.439 --> 04:32:36.100 align:start position:0%
on the floor of the house are all
important

04:32:36.100 --> 04:32:36.110 align:start position:0%
important
 
04:32:36.110 --> 04:32:37.790 align:start position:0%
important

04:32:39.189 --> 04:32:39.199 align:start position:0%
okay representative
 
04:32:42.070 --> 04:32:42.080 align:start position:0%
leus I I understand and really
 
04:32:44.070 --> 04:32:44.080 align:start position:0%
sympathize with the concerns I mean I'll
 
04:32:45.950 --> 04:32:45.960 align:start position:0%
leave how we deal with this up to the
 
04:32:49.109 --> 04:32:49.119 align:start position:0%
chair but if the decision is to work
 
04:32:50.870 --> 04:32:50.880 align:start position:0%
together on I'd be glad to do that I
 
04:32:52.269 --> 04:32:52.279 align:start position:0%
thank you representative goalie I'm
 
04:32:55.710 --> 04:32:55.720 align:start position:0%
sorry to was H over thank you madam
 
04:32:57.910 --> 04:32:57.920 align:start position:0%
chair and I too agree with
 
04:33:01.750 --> 04:33:01.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:04.869 --> 04:33:04.879 align:start position:0%
as this same content is in two specific
 
04:33:09.390 --> 04:33:09.400 align:start position:0%
bills we have before us and while it may
 
04:33:13.109 --> 04:33:13.119 align:start position:0%
have been a chuckle from the attorney
 
04:33:15.670 --> 04:33:15.680 align:start position:0%
oplc to talk about another 100 page Bill
 
04:33:18.070 --> 04:33:18.080 align:start position:0%
coming forward I'm looking down the road
 
04:33:20.551 --> 04:33:20.561 align:start position:0%
that the real possibility is there and
 
04:33:22.709 --> 04:33:22.719 align:start position:0%
it's starting to get out of control they
 
04:33:25.470 --> 04:33:25.480 align:start position:0%
need to start to work on areas that they
 
04:33:27.990 --> 04:33:28.000 align:start position:0%
really want to change come forward with
 
04:33:29.470 --> 04:33:29.480 align:start position:0%
bits in
 
04:33:34.590 --> 04:33:34.600 align:start position:0%
pieces and not 100 page amendments on
 
04:33:36.070 --> 04:33:36.080 align:start position:0%
changing big p pieces of the law that
 
04:33:38.349 --> 04:33:38.359 align:start position:0%
are doing different sections at a time I
 
04:33:40.310 --> 04:33:40.320 align:start position:0%
mean it it bothers me that we're here
 
04:33:43.109 --> 04:33:43.119 align:start position:0%
doing this at this short of notice and I
 
04:33:44.910 --> 04:33:44.920 align:start position:0%
know we worked
 
04:33:47.869 --> 04:33:47.879 align:start position:0%
on trying through the process to get it
 
04:33:50.750 --> 04:33:50.760 align:start position:0%
done in a timely manner but
 
04:33:53.470 --> 04:33:53.480 align:start position:0%
in the way I look at it what we had
 
04:33:54.949 --> 04:33:54.959 align:start position:0%
before us earlier today and I know we're
 
04:33:57.310 --> 04:33:57.320 align:start position:0%
not there but this is part of that
 
04:33:59.029 --> 04:33:59.039 align:start position:0%
should have been in front of us in
 
04:34:01.470 --> 04:34:01.480 align:start position:0%
January to have a full two months to
 
04:34:03.590 --> 04:34:03.600 align:start position:0%
review that and not two
 
04:34:06.269 --> 04:34:06.279 align:start position:0%
weeks um
 
04:34:07.551 --> 04:34:07.561 align:start position:0%
but I'll speak to the amendment in
 
04:34:09.230 --> 04:34:09.240 align:start position:0%
itself and some of the reasons why I'm
 
04:34:12.869 --> 04:34:12.879 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:16.070 --> 04:34:16.080 align:start position:0%
it first is the first section and I'm
 
04:34:19.750 --> 04:34:19.760 align:start position:0%
not sure why it's even in there the
 
04:34:22.709 --> 04:34:22.719 align:start position:0%
purpose statement provide supervision
 
04:34:24.510 --> 04:34:24.520 align:start position:0%
over regulatory bodies comprised of
 
04:34:26.629 --> 04:34:26.639 align:start position:0%
active Market participants I don't know
 
04:34:30.269 --> 04:34:30.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:33.910 --> 04:34:33.920 align:start position:0%
needed second is we'll go down to line
 
04:34:36.670 --> 04:34:36.680 align:start position:0%
18 on this explaining what oplc and the
 
04:34:39.590 --> 04:34:39.600 align:start position:0%
director have the responsibilities to do
 
04:34:41.949 --> 04:34:41.959 align:start position:0%
and the statement as the rules in effect
 
04:34:43.429 --> 04:34:43.439 align:start position:0%
upon the effective date of this section
 
04:34:45.349 --> 04:34:45.359 align:start position:0%
shall remain in effect until repealed by
 
04:34:47.590 --> 04:34:47.600 align:start position:0%
the executive director I don't even know
 
04:34:51.349 --> 04:34:51.359 align:start position:0%
why that needs to be in statute uh
 
04:34:54.390 --> 04:34:54.400 align:start position:0%
because if you change the statute it
 
04:34:57.070 --> 04:34:57.080 align:start position:0%
tends to invalidate the rule we don't
 
04:34:59.070 --> 04:34:59.080 align:start position:0%
want to invalidate any
 
04:35:02.470 --> 04:35:02.480 align:start position:0%
rules but unthinkingly that does need to
 
04:35:04.869 --> 04:35:04.879 align:start position:0%
be there and you'll notice that's in in
 
04:35:06.990 --> 04:35:07.000 align:start position:0%
different the different sections that is
 
04:35:07.000 --> 04:35:10.070 align:start position:0%
different the different sections that is
important

04:35:10.070 --> 04:35:10.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:12.429 --> 04:35:12.439 align:start position:0%
yeah and I I still have the floor so
 
04:35:13.600 --> 04:35:13.610 align:start position:0%
I'll continue
 
04:35:13.610 --> 04:35:19.109 align:start position:0%
I'll continue
[Music]

04:35:19.109 --> 04:35:19.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:21.750 --> 04:35:21.760 align:start position:0%
on and as I've just seen this give me a
 
04:35:23.910 --> 04:35:23.920 align:start position:0%
minute as I go through this looking at
 
04:35:34.189 --> 04:35:34.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:34.199 --> 04:35:37.230 align:start position:0%
 
forward

04:35:37.230 --> 04:35:37.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:41.070 --> 04:35:41.080 align:start position:0%
I ask her I'll stop for now and I'll uh
 
04:35:42.670 --> 04:35:42.680 align:start position:0%
come back when I find the section I look
 
04:35:46.629 --> 04:35:46.639 align:start position:0%
for thank you I appreciate your Thor
 
04:35:49.070 --> 04:35:49.080 align:start position:0%
representative leus yeah I'll just uh
 
04:35:51.590 --> 04:35:51.600 align:start position:0%
comment on the purpose part of it the uh
 
04:35:54.709 --> 04:35:54.719 align:start position:0%
if you look at it um the purpose part
 
04:35:56.429 --> 04:35:56.439 align:start position:0%
which is all through this uh you know
 
04:35:57.670 --> 04:35:57.680 align:start position:0%
for each one of the
 
04:36:00.590 --> 04:36:00.600 align:start position:0%
boards um there was certainly stuff in
 
04:36:02.269 --> 04:36:02.279 align:start position:0%
there that I thought was unnecessary and
 
04:36:04.551 --> 04:36:04.561 align:start position:0%
some people had an issue with and the
 
04:36:07.150 --> 04:36:07.160 align:start position:0%
amendment does remove most of it maybe
 
04:36:09.429 --> 04:36:09.439 align:start position:0%
there's more that could go out but but I
 
04:36:11.551 --> 04:36:11.561 align:start position:0%
removed all that people who were
 
04:36:14.230 --> 04:36:14.240 align:start position:0%
involved had an objection to so try to
 
04:36:17.150 --> 04:36:17.160 align:start position:0%
accommodate that um
 
04:36:20.949 --> 04:36:20.959 align:start position:0%
I'm anyone else
 
04:36:24.269 --> 04:36:24.279 align:start position:0%
Simon uh thank you madam chair I I do I
 
04:36:26.349 --> 04:36:26.359 align:start position:0%
am just curious um and I believe
 
04:36:28.150 --> 04:36:28.160 align:start position:0%
representative Gera brought it up the
 
04:36:29.789 --> 04:36:29.799 align:start position:0%
reference to the executive director I
 
04:36:32.551 --> 04:36:32.561 align:start position:0%
know and looking at the other pieces we
 
04:36:34.750 --> 04:36:34.760 align:start position:0%
we haven't used that language seems like
 
04:36:35.709 --> 04:36:35.719 align:start position:0%
the only
 
04:36:38.150 --> 04:36:38.160 align:start position:0%
place that we're using that language I
 
04:36:39.150 --> 04:36:39.160 align:start position:0%
just don't know if that should be of
 
04:36:41.910 --> 04:36:41.920 align:start position:0%
concern to the committee okay represent
 
04:36:43.670 --> 04:36:43.680 align:start position:0%
laus yeah in the bill is originally
 
04:36:45.869 --> 04:36:45.879 align:start position:0%
drafted it used that language in some
 
04:36:47.830 --> 04:36:47.840 align:start position:0%
places and used office in the other
 
04:36:51.349 --> 04:36:51.359 align:start position:0%
place and um if I recall correctly maybe
 
04:36:52.670 --> 04:36:52.680 align:start position:0%
somebody else in the sub committee can
 
04:36:56.390 --> 04:36:56.400 align:start position:0%
correct me but we we asked that of um
 
04:36:59.230 --> 04:36:59.240 align:start position:0%
the executive director and attorney um
 
04:37:03.590 --> 04:37:03.600 align:start position:0%
aoud and that's what they recommended um
 
04:37:05.670 --> 04:37:05.680 align:start position:0%
and I didn't look I had a chance to look
 
04:37:07.551 --> 04:37:07.561 align:start position:0%
at your 112 page
 
04:37:09.830 --> 04:37:09.840 align:start position:0%
monstrosity um so that you got saddled
 
04:37:13.590 --> 04:37:13.600 align:start position:0%
with so um it says office what it says
 
04:37:16.269 --> 04:37:16.279 align:start position:0%
office and I went Page by Page line by
 
04:37:19.869 --> 04:37:19.879 align:start position:0%
line with the executive director and Mr
 
04:37:22.551 --> 04:37:22.561 align:start position:0%
O and no one said a peep yeah about
 
04:37:24.510 --> 04:37:24.520 align:start position:0%
executive director which is a little
 
04:37:27.109 --> 04:37:27.119 align:start position:0%
bit I'm yes I I don't want to get too
 
04:37:31.230 --> 04:37:31.240 align:start position:0%
much but in U no in in
 
04:37:34.629 --> 04:37:34.639 align:start position:0%
the but the reason we brought it up was
 
04:37:36.070 --> 04:37:36.080 align:start position:0%
because because in some places in the
 
04:37:37.510 --> 04:37:37.520 align:start position:0%
bill it did one thing and in some places
 
04:37:39.150 --> 04:37:39.160 align:start position:0%
did the other and that's why the issue
 
04:37:42.869 --> 04:37:42.879 align:start position:0%
came up for hours representative gold
 
04:37:46.269 --> 04:37:46.279 align:start position:0%
yeah I just wanted to reinforce that um
 
04:37:47.551 --> 04:37:47.561 align:start position:0%
a couple of things that have been said
 
04:37:50.910 --> 04:37:50.920 align:start position:0%
here one is that uh my colleagues who
 
04:37:52.869 --> 04:37:52.879 align:start position:0%
have recognized that we've done an
 
04:37:57.109 --> 04:37:57.119 align:start position:0%
excruciating amount of work on some very
 
04:38:02.189 --> 04:38:02.199 align:start position:0%
intricate um bills on licensing and and
 
04:38:03.789 --> 04:38:03.799 align:start position:0%
so you know I just think some of this is
 
04:38:07.189 --> 04:38:07.199 align:start position:0%
inevitable but specifically on this
 
04:38:10.470 --> 04:38:10.480 align:start position:0%
topic um it came up I believe it was
 
04:38:12.789 --> 04:38:12.799 align:start position:0%
representative maputi who pointed out
 
04:38:14.709 --> 04:38:14.719 align:start position:0%
that she was really bothered by the
 
04:38:17.230 --> 04:38:17.240 align:start position:0%
inconsistency and then the office
 
04:38:22.629 --> 04:38:22.639 align:start position:0%
clarified that um well the office the
 
04:38:24.670 --> 04:38:24.680 align:start position:0%
executive director and the attorney of
 
04:38:24.680 --> 04:38:25.629 align:start position:0%
executive director and the attorney of
of

04:38:25.629 --> 04:38:25.639 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:38:29.029 --> 04:38:29.039 align:start position:0%
oplc um pointed out that it takes an
 
04:38:31.910 --> 04:38:31.920 align:start position:0%
individual to take action that an office
 
04:38:33.750 --> 04:38:33.760 align:start position:0%
really can't so that in a legal
 
04:38:36.269 --> 04:38:36.279 align:start position:0%
technical sense it should be office it
 
04:38:38.029 --> 04:38:38.039 align:start position:0%
should be the executive director
 
04:38:40.990 --> 04:38:41.000 align:start position:0%
throughout and so I know we talked about
 
04:38:43.830 --> 04:38:43.840 align:start position:0%
it um the inconsistency that we were
 
04:38:45.830 --> 04:38:45.840 align:start position:0%
seeing with some of these other bills I
 
04:38:47.990 --> 04:38:48.000 align:start position:0%
just think the bottom line is that I
 
04:38:51.150 --> 04:38:51.160 align:start position:0%
support 100% let's take another week and
 
04:38:54.109 --> 04:38:54.119 align:start position:0%
um and see what we can do to to iron out
 
04:38:56.990 --> 04:38:57.000 align:start position:0%
some of the inconsistent language yeah
 
04:38:58.510 --> 04:38:58.520 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm
 
04:39:01.510 --> 04:39:01.520 align:start position:0%
sure rather disappointed to discover
 
04:39:05.230 --> 04:39:05.240 align:start position:0%
that large portions of this SE this bill
 
04:39:08.510 --> 04:39:08.520 align:start position:0%
are duplicative to sections that are in
 
04:39:09.830 --> 04:39:09.840 align:start position:0%
the amendment to
 
04:39:13.230 --> 04:39:13.240 align:start position:0%
1095 and I think that we ought to when
 
04:39:15.990 --> 04:39:16.000 align:start position:0%
looking at it we ought to put the
 
04:39:18.470 --> 04:39:18.480 align:start position:0%
sections in either one or the other but
 
04:39:21.670 --> 04:39:21.680 align:start position:0%
please not both it makes things much
 
04:39:25.869 --> 04:39:25.879 align:start position:0%
easier for everybody and so in light of
 
04:39:28.230 --> 04:39:28.240 align:start position:0%
that I think we will recess this
 
04:39:28.240 --> 04:39:29.551 align:start position:0%
that I think we will recess this
executive

04:39:29.551 --> 04:39:29.561 align:start position:0%
executive
 
04:39:33.750 --> 04:39:33.760 align:start position:0%
session uh thank you go look at the
 
04:39:35.750 --> 04:39:35.760 align:start position:0%
language and make sure sure it is not
 
04:39:39.708 --> 04:39:39.718 align:start position:0%
duplicative or conflicting with house
 
04:39:40.750 --> 04:39:40.760 align:start position:0%
house bill
 
04:39:40.760 --> 04:39:42.550 align:start position:0%
house bill
1095

04:39:42.550 --> 04:39:42.560 align:start position:0%
1095
 
04:39:45.030 --> 04:39:45.040 align:start position:0%
and we hope come up with clean
 
04:39:47.830 --> 04:39:47.840 align:start position:0%
amendments on both of
 
04:39:47.840 --> 04:39:49.430 align:start position:0%
amendments on both of
them

04:39:49.430 --> 04:39:49.440 align:start position:0%
them
 
04:39:52.670 --> 04:39:52.680 align:start position:0%
yes so we're not up against the deadline
 
04:39:55.788 --> 04:39:55.798 align:start position:0%
yet are we this bill must be voted out
 
04:39:58.708 --> 04:39:58.718 align:start position:0%
of committee by the
 
04:40:02.230 --> 04:40:02.240 align:start position:0%
21st we I'm recessing this until I
 
04:40:03.990 --> 04:40:04.000 align:start position:0%
understand but I I think this is a very
 
04:40:06.590 --> 04:40:06.600 align:start position:0%
wise DEC ision on your part Madam chair
 
04:40:08.350 --> 04:40:08.360 align:start position:0%
the the thing is if we're not up against
 
04:40:08.360 --> 04:40:09.110 align:start position:0%
the the thing is if we're not up against
the

04:40:09.110 --> 04:40:09.120 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:40:11.830 --> 04:40:11.840 align:start position:0%
deadline we can do I there's a lot of
 
04:40:13.190 --> 04:40:13.200 align:start position:0%
work that's been done I haven't been
 
04:40:15.510 --> 04:40:15.520 align:start position:0%
involved in most of it but let's do just
 
04:40:17.788 --> 04:40:17.798 align:start position:0%
a little bit more and get it right it's
 
04:40:20.590 --> 04:40:20.600 align:start position:0%
not quite as this is not commensurate
 
04:40:22.270 --> 04:40:22.280 align:start position:0%
with the kind of work product this
 
04:40:25.670 --> 04:40:25.680 align:start position:0%
committee ordinarily produces yet so
 
04:40:27.550 --> 04:40:27.560 align:start position:0%
let's let's try and make it better and I
 
04:40:29.708 --> 04:40:29.718 align:start position:0%
think it might make sense to take to
 
04:40:32.628 --> 04:40:32.638 align:start position:0%
look at it and take some sections out of
 
04:40:34.990 --> 04:40:35.000 align:start position:0%
one one bill and and put and and make
 
04:40:36.510 --> 04:40:36.520 align:start position:0%
sure that we don't have duplicate
 
04:40:41.350 --> 04:40:41.360 align:start position:0%
sections so um representative laus and
 
04:40:47.470 --> 04:40:47.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:52.230 --> 04:40:52.240 align:start position:0%
sessions all right we will recess that
 
04:41:02.470 --> 04:41:02.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:05.350 --> 04:41:05.360 align:start position:0%
simpler okay
 
04:41:09.190 --> 04:41:09.200 align:start position:0%
all right on House Bill
 
04:41:12.868 --> 04:41:12.878 align:start position:0%
1059 I move a to pass with
 
04:41:16.868 --> 04:41:16.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:22.270 --> 04:41:22.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:27.190 --> 04:41:27.200 align:start position:0%
H I'll second that Amendment I'll second
 
04:41:29.910 --> 04:41:29.920 align:start position:0%
okay it's
 
04:41:33.628 --> 04:41:33.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:33.638 --> 04:41:36.270 align:start position:0%
 
0804

04:41:36.270 --> 04:41:36.280 align:start position:0%
0804
 
04:41:38.750 --> 04:41:38.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:38.760 --> 04:41:47.030 align:start position:0%
 
amendment

04:41:47.030 --> 04:41:47.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:51.310 --> 04:41:51.320 align:start position:0%
okay it's my okay
 
04:41:55.310 --> 04:41:55.320 align:start position:0%
so as recommended by the
 
04:41:59.350 --> 04:41:59.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:59.360 --> 04:42:01.030 align:start position:0%
 
amendment

04:42:01.030 --> 04:42:01.040 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
04:42:04.270 --> 04:42:04.280 align:start position:0%
simply includes building code review
 
04:42:07.830 --> 04:42:07.840 align:start position:0%
board amendments approved as of January
 
04:42:10.310 --> 04:42:10.320 align:start position:0%
instead of November because they
 
04:42:12.750 --> 04:42:12.760 align:start position:0%
included they had a few more minor ones
 
04:42:15.550 --> 04:42:15.560 align:start position:0%
which were sent to the committee and
 
04:42:18.390 --> 04:42:18.400 align:start position:0%
then made the effective date July
 
04:42:22.830 --> 04:42:22.840 align:start position:0%
1st for Simplicity and that's the new um
 
04:42:26.350 --> 04:42:26.360 align:start position:0%
new fiscal year just to give it a fixed
 
04:42:29.310 --> 04:42:29.320 align:start position:0%
date for for convenience this was the
 
04:42:31.868 --> 04:42:31.878 align:start position:0%
recommendation of the subcommittee and
 
04:42:31.878 --> 04:42:32.868 align:start position:0%
recommendation of the subcommittee and
representative

04:42:32.868 --> 04:42:32.878 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:42:35.788 --> 04:42:35.798 align:start position:0%
brodic I have nothing else Dad thank you
 
04:42:38.788 --> 04:42:38.798 align:start position:0%
okay anyone else comments questions
 
04:42:40.708 --> 04:42:40.718 align:start position:0%
representative Simon thank you madam
 
04:42:42.030 --> 04:42:42.040 align:start position:0%
chair could you just remind me the
 
04:42:44.110 --> 04:42:44.120 align:start position:0%
purpose of the striking out of 12
 
04:42:44.120 --> 04:42:52.110 align:start position:0%
purpose of the striking out of 12
through

04:42:52.110 --> 04:42:52.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:55.430 --> 04:42:55.440 align:start position:0%
14 it's that's not a change in the
 
04:42:57.590 --> 04:42:57.600 align:start position:0%
amendment it's not okay that's in the in
 
04:42:58.750 --> 04:42:58.760 align:start position:0%
the bill itself it's in the original
 
04:43:03.110 --> 04:43:03.120 align:start position:0%
bill right yes Y and it
 
04:43:06.510 --> 04:43:06.520 align:start position:0%
um I think get covered
 
04:43:06.520 --> 04:43:09.590 align:start position:0%
um I think get covered
elsewhere

04:43:09.590 --> 04:43:09.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:11.868 --> 04:43:11.878 align:start position:0%
okay represent manager
 
04:43:15.628 --> 04:43:15.638 align:start position:0%
ptin thank you madam chair my question I
 
04:43:18.110 --> 04:43:18.120 align:start position:0%
don't know who can answer but uh I'm
 
04:43:21.868 --> 04:43:21.878 align:start position:0%
confused as to there's another building
 
04:43:24.788 --> 04:43:24.798 align:start position:0%
code bill I believe right with the clean
 
04:43:28.470 --> 04:43:28.480 align:start position:0%
energy or this is the one that was the
 
04:43:32.750 --> 04:43:32.760 align:start position:0%
energy portion of it energy conservation
 
04:43:35.190 --> 04:43:35.200 align:start position:0%
code is part of
 
04:43:38.230 --> 04:43:38.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:42.310 --> 04:43:42.320 align:start position:0%
bill do references but does not update
 
04:43:45.910 --> 04:43:45.920 align:start position:0%
the energy code this we had an amendment
 
04:43:49.310 --> 04:43:49.320 align:start position:0%
that we discussed at the hearing and we
 
04:43:52.310 --> 04:43:52.320 align:start position:0%
discussed in subcomittee and decided not
 
04:43:52.320 --> 04:43:54.390 align:start position:0%
discussed in subcomittee and decided not
to

04:43:54.390 --> 04:43:54.400 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:43:56.910 --> 04:43:56.920 align:start position:0%
accept do you wish to know
 
04:44:00.750 --> 04:44:00.760 align:start position:0%
why no so I that that clarifies my
 
04:44:03.550 --> 04:44:03.560 align:start position:0%
question as to this that clean the
 
04:44:06.350 --> 04:44:06.360 align:start position:0%
energy portion is not part of it so the
 
04:44:09.788 --> 04:44:09.798 align:start position:0%
energy portion is not included okay
 
04:44:13.070 --> 04:44:13.080 align:start position:0%
because we were convinced that it had
 
04:44:15.190 --> 04:44:15.200 align:start position:0%
too many unintended
 
04:44:17.830 --> 04:44:17.840 align:start position:0%
consequences and it had
 
04:44:22.910 --> 04:44:22.920 align:start position:0%
also um increase the cost for homes in
 
04:44:25.390 --> 04:44:25.400 align:start position:0%
particular much more than it then would
 
04:44:28.430 --> 04:44:28.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:31.270 --> 04:44:31.280 align:start position:0%
it can I follow up ask you another
 
04:44:36.788 --> 04:44:36.798 align:start position:0%
question um the energy for commercial
 
04:44:40.948 --> 04:44:40.958 align:start position:0%
meaning anything over four units for
 
04:44:42.948 --> 04:44:42.958 align:start position:0%
residential would be considered
 
04:44:42.958 --> 04:44:44.708 align:start position:0%
residential would be considered
commercial

04:44:44.708 --> 04:44:44.718 align:start position:0%
commercial
 
04:44:49.430 --> 04:44:49.440 align:start position:0%
correct uh not exact residential is no
 
04:44:51.310 --> 04:44:51.320 align:start position:0%
more than three
 
04:44:56.550 --> 04:44:56.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:00.868 --> 04:45:00.878 align:start position:0%
it's in some size limit which I I forget
 
04:45:02.990 --> 04:45:03.000 align:start position:0%
and so a
 
04:45:05.430 --> 04:45:05.440 align:start position:0%
small business business could be covered
 
04:45:09.430 --> 04:45:09.440 align:start position:0%
under the residential code um what more
 
04:45:10.670 --> 04:45:10.680 align:start position:0%
than four
 
04:45:10.680 --> 04:45:12.628 align:start position:0%
than four
stories

04:45:12.628 --> 04:45:12.638 align:start position:0%
stories
 
04:45:17.150 --> 04:45:17.160 align:start position:0%
is is commercial by definition and over
 
04:45:20.310 --> 04:45:20.320 align:start position:0%
I forget how many thousand feet 5,000 I
 
04:45:24.670 --> 04:45:24.680 align:start position:0%
think is is commercial we can we asked
 
04:45:27.750 --> 04:45:27.760 align:start position:0%
about incorporating the commercial
 
04:45:31.230 --> 04:45:31.240 align:start position:0%
energy code but
 
04:45:34.030 --> 04:45:34.040 align:start position:0%
we we are not skilled enough to do that
 
04:45:38.030 --> 04:45:38.040 align:start position:0%
our ourselves and the people that are
 
04:45:40.270 --> 04:45:40.280 align:start position:0%
skilled enough couldn't come to an
 
04:45:43.590 --> 04:45:43.600 align:start position:0%
agreement on how to do that
 
04:45:47.948 --> 04:45:47.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:51.310 --> 04:45:51.320 align:start position:0%
to better not to to try and split it
 
04:45:54.070 --> 04:45:54.080 align:start position:0%
than to do it really badly which is how
 
04:45:57.390 --> 04:45:57.400 align:start position:0%
I guess the subcommittee would do it one
 
04:45:57.400 --> 04:45:58.230 align:start position:0%
I guess the subcommittee would do it one
last

04:45:58.230 --> 04:45:58.240 align:start position:0%
last
 
04:46:03.350 --> 04:46:03.360 align:start position:0%
one uh so my concern with that is that
 
04:46:08.230 --> 04:46:08.240 align:start position:0%
with so many housing crisis multi 150
 
04:46:12.910 --> 04:46:12.920 align:start position:0%
unit uh complexes Workforce
 
04:46:16.590 --> 04:46:16.600 align:start position:0%
uh you name it market rate Workforce low
 
04:46:19.230 --> 04:46:19.240 align:start position:0%
income housing all those things coming
 
04:46:23.470 --> 04:46:23.480 align:start position:0%
up not having a clear understanding of
 
04:46:26.590 --> 04:46:26.600 align:start position:0%
where this you know where we stand with
 
04:46:28.910 --> 04:46:28.920 align:start position:0%
the Energy Efficiency and conservation
 
04:46:32.110 --> 04:46:32.120 align:start position:0%
coming up from ground app would be a
 
04:46:34.430 --> 04:46:34.440 align:start position:0%
detriment because retrofitting the these
 
04:46:36.548 --> 04:46:36.558 align:start position:0%
buildings would be more costly than
 
04:46:42.350 --> 04:46:42.360 align:start position:0%
coming up and on the same token with
 
04:46:45.990 --> 04:46:46.000 align:start position:0%
um keep you know passing this we have an
 
04:46:48.628 --> 04:46:48.638 align:start position:0%
option to see if there's a way to do
 
04:46:50.948 --> 04:46:50.958 align:start position:0%
something at the floor
 
04:46:56.350 --> 04:46:56.360 align:start position:0%
or right amend it at the uh in the floor
 
04:47:03.110 --> 04:47:03.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:06.230 --> 04:47:06.240 align:start position:0%
thanks anyone else representative
 
04:47:10.270 --> 04:47:10.280 align:start position:0%
Shuan thank you madam chair um both in
 
04:47:12.708 --> 04:47:12.718 align:start position:0%
the Committee hearing and in the
 
04:47:14.430 --> 04:47:14.440 align:start position:0%
subcommittee hearing
 
04:47:17.510 --> 04:47:17.520 align:start position:0%
particularly uh we heard a lot of pro
 
04:47:22.430 --> 04:47:22.440 align:start position:0%
and con uh regarding the energy portion
 
04:47:24.750 --> 04:47:24.760 align:start position:0%
uh the fact of the matter is that I
 
04:47:27.590 --> 04:47:27.600 align:start position:0%
think the mood of this committee is that
 
04:47:31.830 --> 04:47:31.840 align:start position:0%
we do need to adopt uh updating the
 
04:47:34.948 --> 04:47:34.958 align:start position:0%
building codes for right now and that's
 
04:47:37.628 --> 04:47:37.638 align:start position:0%
where this amendment with this bill will
 
04:47:41.390 --> 04:47:41.400 align:start position:0%
take us um if we feel that we need to
 
04:47:44.110 --> 04:47:44.120 align:start position:0%
update the energy portion uh we will
 
04:47:50.868 --> 04:47:50.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:54.230 --> 04:47:54.240 align:start position:0%
you anyone else representative Brown um
 
04:47:56.110 --> 04:47:56.120 align:start position:0%
thank you m chair I want to speak to the
 
04:47:59.190 --> 04:47:59.200 align:start position:0%
energy portion but in the L in the
 
04:48:02.350 --> 04:48:02.360 align:start position:0%
discussion going ahead shall I wait
 
04:48:05.750 --> 04:48:05.760 align:start position:0%
oh it's not relevant to the amendment
 
04:48:08.990 --> 04:48:09.000 align:start position:0%
specifically that's okay it's that'll
 
04:48:11.070 --> 04:48:11.080 align:start position:0%
simplify the discussion of the of the
 
04:48:12.310 --> 04:48:12.320 align:start position:0%
ought to pass
 
04:48:14.390 --> 04:48:14.400 align:start position:0%
motion okay
 
04:48:17.230 --> 04:48:17.240 align:start position:0%
um so obviously we've all received a lot
 
04:48:21.230 --> 04:48:21.240 align:start position:0%
of information I think it's it would be
 
04:48:22.470 --> 04:48:22.480 align:start position:0%
my suggestion for everyone in the
 
04:48:24.070 --> 04:48:24.080 align:start position:0%
committee to look at one of the emails
 
04:48:28.190 --> 04:48:28.200 align:start position:0%
that sent us um the 2021 iecc and the
 
04:48:30.230 --> 04:48:30.240 align:start position:0%
energy appendix for
 
04:48:32.628 --> 04:48:32.638 align:start position:0%
that uh no one discussed this when they
 
04:48:36.470 --> 04:48:36.480 align:start position:0%
proposed the the iecc going to
 
04:48:39.750 --> 04:48:39.760 align:start position:0%
2021 in the energy appendix and i' I've
 
04:48:40.830 --> 04:48:40.840 align:start position:0%
looked at this and I've done a little
 
04:48:43.510 --> 04:48:43.520 align:start position:0%
other reading so it's my
 
04:48:46.548 --> 04:48:46.558 align:start position:0%
interpretation it says
 
04:48:50.470 --> 04:48:50.480 align:start position:0%
specifically that this appendix will
 
04:48:54.190 --> 04:48:54.200 align:start position:0%
allow jurisdictions towns Andor
 
04:48:57.350 --> 04:48:57.360 align:start position:0%
cities to require Residential Building
 
04:49:00.510 --> 04:49:00.520 align:start position:0%
to mean Net Zero Energy meaning you have
 
04:49:02.708 --> 04:49:02.718 align:start position:0%
to produce as much energy as you use in
 
04:49:05.030 --> 04:49:05.040 align:start position:0%
your house and your jurisdiction can do
 
04:49:06.990 --> 04:49:07.000 align:start position:0%
that within the time frame that they
 
04:49:10.390 --> 04:49:10.400 align:start position:0%
choose so if we were to pass the 2021
 
04:49:13.708 --> 04:49:13.718 align:start position:0%
ICC no one mentioned this appendix which
 
04:49:16.470 --> 04:49:16.480 align:start position:0%
can put a a pretty serious cost on
 
04:49:18.510 --> 04:49:18.520 align:start position:0%
residential housing in separate
 
04:49:20.548 --> 04:49:20.558 align:start position:0%
communities if I'm reading it
 
04:49:23.788 --> 04:49:23.798 align:start position:0%
correctly thank you thank you other
 
04:49:28.270 --> 04:49:28.280 align:start position:0%
comments president V py sorry madam all
 
04:49:34.030 --> 04:49:34.040 align:start position:0%
right chair um yes Net Zero is that are
 
04:49:37.270 --> 04:49:37.280 align:start position:0%
couple of definition of Net Zero um in
 
04:49:40.708 --> 04:49:40.718 align:start position:0%
terms of trying to see the it's not the
 
04:49:43.990 --> 04:49:44.000 align:start position:0%
energy produced it's the passive Energy
 
04:49:48.548 --> 04:49:48.558 align:start position:0%
Efficiency conservation and uh usage to
 
04:49:51.830 --> 04:49:51.840 align:start position:0%
reduce the carbon footprint and that
 
04:49:54.510 --> 04:49:54.520 align:start position:0%
also qualifies as Net Zero and I think
 
04:49:54.520 --> 04:49:55.470 align:start position:0%
also qualifies as Net Zero and I think
by

04:49:55.470 --> 04:49:55.480 align:start position:0%
by
 
04:49:57.430 --> 04:49:57.440 align:start position:0%
adopting um
 
04:50:02.270 --> 04:50:02.280 align:start position:0%
2021 building code that will give us the
 
04:50:06.670 --> 04:50:06.680 align:start position:0%
opportunity to see how that can be done
 
04:50:09.150 --> 04:50:09.160 align:start position:0%
in the new constructions especially the
 
04:50:13.628 --> 04:50:13.638 align:start position:0%
Mega um buildings or uh all the new
 
04:50:16.670 --> 04:50:16.680 align:start position:0%
upcoming one to be done so if the
 
04:50:20.030 --> 04:50:20.040 align:start position:0%
building code is already if this is
 
04:50:22.708 --> 04:50:22.718 align:start position:0%
adopted it will help
 
04:50:26.470 --> 04:50:26.480 align:start position:0%
with bring you know bringing that energy
 
04:50:26.480 --> 04:50:27.830 align:start position:0%
with bring you know bringing that energy
and

04:50:27.830 --> 04:50:27.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:50:29.830 --> 04:50:29.840 align:start position:0%
climate code
 
04:50:36.510 --> 04:50:36.520 align:start position:0%
into being if this passes it will enable
 
04:50:38.910 --> 04:50:38.920 align:start position:0%
that I think that's my understanding I
 
04:50:40.670 --> 04:50:40.680 align:start position:0%
could be totally wrong
 
04:50:43.270 --> 04:50:43.280 align:start position:0%
but that's my
 
04:50:45.708 --> 04:50:45.718 align:start position:0%
understanding uh thank you madam chair
 
04:50:47.548 --> 04:50:47.558 align:start position:0%
as someone that works on job sites and
 
04:50:49.868 --> 04:50:49.878 align:start position:0%
builds houses daily well except for
 
04:50:53.070 --> 04:50:53.080 align:start position:0%
Saturday and Sunday mostly um I think a
 
04:50:55.150 --> 04:50:55.160 align:start position:0%
lot of these building codes are just
 
04:50:57.788 --> 04:50:57.798 align:start position:0%
excessive and unnecessary we talk about
 
04:51:01.150 --> 04:51:01.160 align:start position:0%
lowering the cost of housing but I mean
 
04:51:03.150 --> 04:51:03.160 align:start position:0%
I'm on a job right now up in molten Boro
 
04:51:04.788 --> 04:51:04.798 align:start position:0%
on Squam one of those multi-million
 
04:51:07.190 --> 04:51:07.200 align:start position:0%
dollar houses but the
 
04:51:07.200 --> 04:51:09.110 align:start position:0%
dollar houses but the
excessive

04:51:09.110 --> 04:51:09.120 align:start position:0%
excessive
 
04:51:12.230 --> 04:51:12.240 align:start position:0%
um the extent that they make you go to
 
04:51:15.110 --> 04:51:15.120 align:start position:0%
to secure just a three-story Tower with
 
04:51:17.910 --> 04:51:17.920 align:start position:0%
these concrete foundations it's it's
 
04:51:19.350 --> 04:51:19.360 align:start position:0%
really absurd and if you really want to
 
04:51:20.548 --> 04:51:20.558 align:start position:0%
get an idea of what's going on you
 
04:51:22.070 --> 04:51:22.080 align:start position:0%
should go to these job sites and talk to
 
04:51:23.350 --> 04:51:23.360 align:start position:0%
these high school dropouts that are
 
04:51:24.708 --> 04:51:24.718 align:start position:0%
working on these job sites and building
 
04:51:27.670 --> 04:51:27.680 align:start position:0%
houses they know much more than we do
 
04:51:29.270 --> 04:51:29.280 align:start position:0%
and as far as the energy conservation
 
04:51:32.830 --> 04:51:32.840 align:start position:0%
stuff goes a house okay just real quick
 
04:51:34.990 --> 04:51:35.000 align:start position:0%
up in Sandwich working on on a barn this
 
04:51:36.628 --> 04:51:36.638 align:start position:0%
seill plate need to be replaced this
 
04:51:38.548 --> 04:51:38.558 align:start position:0%
thing has been standing since the late
 
04:51:40.788 --> 04:51:40.798 align:start position:0%
1700s the we're making these houses
 
04:51:42.670 --> 04:51:42.680 align:start position:0%
airtight right now which is not helping
 
04:51:44.270 --> 04:51:44.280 align:start position:0%
anything they're rotting from the inside
 
04:51:46.390 --> 04:51:46.400 align:start position:0%
out and the plywood if you look at it's
 
04:51:48.590 --> 04:51:48.600 align:start position:0%
all stamped exempt from from Al from
 
04:51:48.600 --> 04:51:49.750 align:start position:0%
all stamped exempt from from Al from
alahh

04:51:49.750 --> 04:51:49.760 align:start position:0%
alahh
 
04:51:53.150 --> 04:51:53.160 align:start position:0%
regulations so um anyway point being is
 
04:51:54.990 --> 04:51:55.000 align:start position:0%
we're making these toxic boxes that are
 
04:51:56.948 --> 04:51:56.958 align:start position:0%
airtight that if you look at when you
 
04:51:58.390 --> 04:51:58.400 align:start position:0%
put in doors in Windows it actually
 
04:52:00.030 --> 04:52:00.040 align:start position:0%
tells you that the houses have negative
 
04:52:02.070 --> 04:52:02.080 align:start position:0%
pressure now it's actually sucking in
 
04:52:04.990 --> 04:52:05.000 align:start position:0%
water from the outside side so anyway
 
04:52:06.350 --> 04:52:06.360 align:start position:0%
people need to breathe houses need to
 
04:52:07.470 --> 04:52:07.480 align:start position:0%
breathe and I think a lot of these
 
04:52:08.910 --> 04:52:08.920 align:start position:0%
energy conservation things they might
 
04:52:10.430 --> 04:52:10.440 align:start position:0%
mean well but I don't think they
 
04:52:13.430 --> 04:52:13.440 align:start position:0%
actually have common sense put into play
 
04:52:14.510 --> 04:52:14.520 align:start position:0%
so that's all I'm going to say I think
 
04:52:15.430 --> 04:52:15.440 align:start position:0%
you should talk to people building
 
04:52:16.910 --> 04:52:16.920 align:start position:0%
houses stop over one time when you see
 
04:52:18.150 --> 04:52:18.160 align:start position:0%
somebody and just talk to them I think
 
04:52:20.350 --> 04:52:20.360 align:start position:0%
you might learn a few things so thank
 
04:52:23.750 --> 04:52:23.760 align:start position:0%
you madam chair I just have to you know
 
04:52:26.070 --> 04:52:26.080 align:start position:0%
I am in that Consulting business of
 
04:52:29.590 --> 04:52:29.600 align:start position:0%
building Net Zero commun communities and
 
04:52:33.150 --> 04:52:33.160 align:start position:0%
buildings and uh that whole efficiency
 
04:52:36.270 --> 04:52:36.280 align:start position:0%
energy and I'm not talking from just
 
04:52:39.350 --> 04:52:39.360 align:start position:0%
theoretical knowledge so I do understand
 
04:52:41.948 --> 04:52:41.958 align:start position:0%
the codes and the glean and passive
 
04:52:45.030 --> 04:52:45.040 align:start position:0%
buildings that are coming up and New
 
04:52:48.070 --> 04:52:48.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is way behind it but
 
04:52:51.548 --> 04:52:51.558 align:start position:0%
that's that's not my point it is it's
 
04:52:53.390 --> 04:52:53.400 align:start position:0%
happening whether we like it or not
 
04:52:57.070 --> 04:52:57.080 align:start position:0%
Across the Nation across the globe and
 
04:53:00.628 --> 04:53:00.638 align:start position:0%
so the more we adopt and look at it
 
04:53:04.110 --> 04:53:04.120 align:start position:0%
preemptively it's not this whole um
 
04:53:06.548 --> 04:53:06.558 align:start position:0%
monstrosity of Energy Efficiency and
 
04:53:09.150 --> 04:53:09.160 align:start position:0%
climate change is a cost to the rate
 
04:53:12.990 --> 04:53:13.000 align:start position:0%
payers is really
 
04:53:16.510 --> 04:53:16.520 align:start position:0%
not based in reality so that's my two
 
04:53:19.390 --> 04:53:19.400 align:start position:0%
cents so I just want to make sure that
 
04:53:24.190 --> 04:53:24.200 align:start position:0%
um I'm not speaking from just Theory and
 
04:53:27.070 --> 04:53:27.080 align:start position:0%
uh things so I just wanted to bring that
 
04:53:29.470 --> 04:53:29.480 align:start position:0%
to attention thank you madam chair and
 
04:53:31.390 --> 04:53:31.400 align:start position:0%
I'm sure that that from that you are
 
04:53:35.190 --> 04:53:35.200 align:start position:0%
well aware that the owner of the project
 
04:53:37.030 --> 04:53:37.040 align:start position:0%
can requ
 
04:53:37.040 --> 04:53:38.910 align:start position:0%
can requ
request

04:53:38.910 --> 04:53:38.920 align:start position:0%
request
 
04:53:42.990 --> 04:53:43.000 align:start position:0%
um require and request settings that are
 
04:53:45.750 --> 04:53:45.760 align:start position:0%
vastly exceeding what the building code
 
04:53:48.430 --> 04:53:48.440 align:start position:0%
requires and I I that's what point that
 
04:53:50.788 --> 04:53:50.798 align:start position:0%
I want to make the building code should
 
04:53:54.310 --> 04:53:54.320 align:start position:0%
be the minimum necessary for safe
 
04:53:58.390 --> 04:53:58.400 align:start position:0%
buildings and the builders
 
04:54:01.670 --> 04:54:01.680 align:start position:0%
are and the owners are entitled to make
 
04:54:04.830 --> 04:54:04.840 align:start position:0%
to add additional requirements all they
 
04:54:08.030 --> 04:54:08.040 align:start position:0%
want and many of them
 
04:54:11.030 --> 04:54:11.040 align:start position:0%
do representative round uh thank you
 
04:54:12.628 --> 04:54:12.638 align:start position:0%
madam chair for letting me fog this a
 
04:54:13.590 --> 04:54:13.600 align:start position:0%
little bit
 
04:54:13.600 --> 04:54:16.390 align:start position:0%
little bit
more

04:54:16.390 --> 04:54:16.400 align:start position:0%
more
 
04:54:19.070 --> 04:54:19.080 align:start position:0%
um to your point building code should be
 
04:54:21.470 --> 04:54:21.480 align:start position:0%
for safety for to make sure our
 
04:54:23.110 --> 04:54:23.120 align:start position:0%
buildings are constructed properly for
 
04:54:24.990 --> 04:54:25.000 align:start position:0%
people's safety if you read this
 
04:54:27.270 --> 04:54:27.280 align:start position:0%
appendix here's what it says about the
 
04:54:27.280 --> 04:54:30.548 align:start position:0%
appendix here's what it says about the
20121

04:54:30.548 --> 04:54:30.558 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:33.510 --> 04:54:33.520 align:start position:0%
iecc about 300 cities and counties and
 
04:54:35.590 --> 04:54:35.600 align:start position:0%
10 states are signatories to the we are
 
04:54:38.310 --> 04:54:38.320 align:start position:0%
still in commitment supporting climate
 
04:54:39.948 --> 04:54:39.958 align:start position:0%
action to meet the goals of the Paris
 
04:54:39.958 --> 04:54:41.670 align:start position:0%
action to meet the goals of the Paris
climate

04:54:41.670 --> 04:54:41.680 align:start position:0%
climate
 
04:54:44.030 --> 04:54:44.040 align:start position:0%
Accord and over 150 cities have
 
04:54:46.510 --> 04:54:46.520 align:start position:0%
committed to using 100% renewable energy
 
04:54:48.628 --> 04:54:48.638 align:start position:0%
more are joining all the time the
 
04:54:50.110 --> 04:54:50.120 align:start position:0%
building energy code is an important
 
04:54:52.110 --> 04:54:52.120 align:start position:0%
policy tool for jurisdictions as they
 
04:54:54.628 --> 04:54:54.638 align:start position:0%
pursue these types of goals that is not
 
04:54:57.670 --> 04:54:57.680 align:start position:0%
about safety that's about climate
 
04:55:00.190 --> 04:55:00.200 align:start position:0%
change thank you representative Brown
 
04:55:02.390 --> 04:55:02.400 align:start position:0%

04:56:00.948 --> 04:56:00.958 align:start position:0%
I'll move ought to pass with Amendment
 
04:56:05.910 --> 04:56:05.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:11.030 --> 04:56:11.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:14.110 --> 04:56:14.120 align:start position:0%
BR all right does anyone else have
 
04:56:18.030 --> 04:56:18.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:21.670 --> 04:56:21.680 align:start position:0%
add yes 4% of gold just quickly I'll say
 
04:56:23.750 --> 04:56:23.760 align:start position:0%
I will support the itl on this but I
 
04:56:25.750 --> 04:56:25.760 align:start position:0%
will look forward to if an amendment
 
04:56:27.510 --> 04:56:27.520 align:start position:0%
comes forward on the floor to add the
 
04:56:29.788 --> 04:56:29.798 align:start position:0%
energy code back in because I would say
 
04:56:32.310 --> 04:56:32.320 align:start position:0%
that a destroyed planet is not very safe
 
04:56:34.910 --> 04:56:34.920 align:start position:0%
for people to live on thank you thank
 
04:56:37.868 --> 04:56:37.878 align:start position:0%
you for that any other
 
04:56:41.030 --> 04:56:41.040 align:start position:0%
comments representative Dolan
 
04:56:43.830 --> 04:56:43.840 align:start position:0%
oh yes I know she made a mistake she
 
04:56:47.350 --> 04:56:47.360 align:start position:0%
meant she's not voting yes on otpa okay
 
04:56:50.430 --> 04:56:50.440 align:start position:0%
that's what she meant all right all
 
04:56:52.750 --> 04:56:52.760 align:start position:0%
right I figured that thank you for that
 
04:56:54.868 --> 04:56:54.878 align:start position:0%
clarification because I thought I knew
 
04:56:57.830 --> 04:56:57.840 align:start position:0%
what we were doing until I
 
04:57:01.030 --> 04:57:01.040 align:start position:0%
heard that's okay all right so we shall
 
04:57:02.830 --> 04:57:02.840 align:start position:0%
all hang together anyone else we shall
 
04:57:05.868 --> 04:57:05.878 align:start position:0%
all hang together indeed so the motion
 
04:57:07.868 --> 04:57:07.878 align:start position:0%
is ought to pass with Amendment on House
 
04:57:11.190 --> 04:57:11.200 align:start position:0%

wish to speak to your
 
04:58:42.548 --> 04:58:42.558 align:start position:0%
motion yes um I think during the
 
04:58:46.030 --> 04:58:46.040 align:start position:0%
testimony uh we heard from uh director
 
04:58:48.830 --> 04:58:48.840 align:start position:0%
goule that this is already being done
 
04:58:51.590 --> 04:58:51.600 align:start position:0%
and in the process of being done on as
 
04:58:54.310 --> 04:58:54.320 align:start position:0%
many uh web pages as they can going
 
04:58:58.430 --> 04:58:58.440 align:start position:0%
forward um so I I feel that this is not
 
04:59:01.470 --> 04:59:01.480 align:start position:0%
necessary I think it's been um made loud
 
04:59:03.628 --> 04:59:03.638 align:start position:0%
and clear that this should be a prior
 
04:59:06.350 --> 04:59:06.360 align:start position:0%
and I think he understands that and with
 
04:59:09.310 --> 04:59:09.320 align:start position:0%
that I'll leave it at that represent gr
 
04:59:11.310 --> 04:59:11.320 align:start position:0%
do you to speak to your second yes thank
 
04:59:13.470 --> 04:59:13.480 align:start position:0%
you um during the testimony we do hear
 
04:59:14.830 --> 04:59:14.840 align:start position:0%
the department of information
 
04:59:18.230 --> 04:59:18.240 align:start position:0%
Technologies is working on a um
 
04:59:20.868 --> 04:59:20.878 align:start position:0%
consistent design for web pages for the
 
04:59:22.948 --> 04:59:22.958 align:start position:0%
state agencies that includes that
 
04:59:25.230 --> 04:59:25.240 align:start position:0%
information and therefore it's already
 
04:59:29.910 --> 04:59:29.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:32.750 --> 04:59:32.760 align:start position:0%
idea okay anyone else representative
 
04:59:32.760 --> 04:59:33.990 align:start position:0%
idea okay anyone else representative
Smith

04:59:33.990 --> 04:59:34.000 align:start position:0%
Smith
 
04:59:36.230 --> 04:59:36.240 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair well I think there
 
04:59:39.390 --> 04:59:39.400 align:start position:0%
is some argument for some
 
04:59:41.590 --> 04:59:41.600 align:start position:0%
individuality I think to the degree that
 
04:59:44.190 --> 04:59:44.200 align:start position:0%
our web pages have a
 
04:59:48.350 --> 04:59:48.360 align:start position:0%
certain uniform look so that the that
 
04:59:50.868 --> 04:59:50.878 align:start position:0%
public who doesn't deal with this every
 
04:59:53.470 --> 04:59:53.480 align:start position:0%
day when they when they go from one page
 
04:59:56.788 --> 04:59:56.798 align:start position:0%
to another at least have some idea you
 
04:59:58.990 --> 04:59:59.000 align:start position:0%
know which side of the road they're
 
05:00:00.590 --> 05:00:00.600 align:start position:0%
they're going to be driving on so to
 
05:00:04.350 --> 05:00:04.360 align:start position:0%
speak so I think that this is
 
05:00:06.910 --> 05:00:06.920 align:start position:0%
probably uh the way we ought to go thank
 
05:00:10.590 --> 05:00:10.600 align:start position:0%
you anyone else yeah i' have to agree
 
05:00:13.470 --> 05:00:13.480 align:start position:0%
that this is the way we ought to go and
 
05:00:16.310 --> 05:00:16.320 align:start position:0%
uh I plan to start checking a few
 
05:00:18.948 --> 05:00:18.958 align:start position:0%
websites after they've had a chance to
 
05:00:20.830 --> 05:00:20.840 align:start position:0%
put them new ones up and make sure that
 
05:00:23.948 --> 05:00:23.958 align:start position:0%
the contact and button is right up
 
05:00:27.070 --> 05:00:27.080 align:start position:0%
there but uh I think I think they got
 
05:00:27.080 --> 05:00:28.150 align:start position:0%
there but uh I think I think they got
the

05:00:28.150 --> 05:00:28.160 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:00:31.510 --> 05:00:31.520 align:start position:0%
point representative Brown I I would as
 
05:00:33.430 --> 05:00:33.440 align:start position:0%
the sponsor as you all know I'd say
 
05:00:35.750 --> 05:00:35.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for for your consideration I
 
05:00:38.270 --> 05:00:38.280 align:start position:0%
agree and um at least it got them off
 
05:00:40.310 --> 05:00:40.320 align:start position:0%
dead center and moving what I think we
 
05:00:42.230 --> 05:00:42.240 align:start position:0%
think is in the right direction so thank
 
05:00:45.868 --> 05:00:45.878 align:start position:0%

05:00:48.590 --> 05:00:48.600 align:start position:0%

this one on consent and since we are
 
05:01:47.390 --> 05:01:47.400 align:start position:0%
moving right along I I'm suggesting a
 
05:01:49.030 --> 05:01:49.040 align:start position:0%
10-minute break so we can stretch our
 
05:01:49.040 --> 05:02:01.750 align:start position:0%
10-minute break so we can stretch our
legs

05:02:01.750 --> 05:02:01.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:01.760 --> 05:11:13.350 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

05:11:13.350 --> 05:11:13.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:13.360 --> 05:11:20.230 align:start position:0%
 
not

05:11:20.230 --> 05:11:20.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:22.708 --> 05:11:22.718 align:start position:0%
here guess we'll have to do a different
 
05:11:26.150 --> 05:11:26.160 align:start position:0%
one what's that 1411 yeah I was going I
 
05:11:29.708 --> 05:11:29.718 align:start position:0%
was going to do 1408 but Cherry's not
 
05:11:33.628 --> 05:11:33.638 align:start position:0%
here all right uh resuming our executive
 
05:11:36.948 --> 05:11:36.958 align:start position:0%
session House Bill 1411 representative
 
05:11:40.670 --> 05:11:40.680 align:start position:0%
groda yes um on House Bill 1411 Madam
 
05:11:43.350 --> 05:11:43.360 align:start position:0%
chair I move
 
05:11:46.708 --> 05:11:46.718 align:start position:0%
itl is there a
 
05:11:49.390 --> 05:11:49.400 align:start position:0%
second I'll second
 
05:11:52.110 --> 05:11:52.120 align:start position:0%
it do you wish to speak to your motion
 
05:11:54.628 --> 05:11:54.638 align:start position:0%
yes thank you you might recall that this
 
05:11:58.910 --> 05:11:58.920 align:start position:0%
bill was um was written was submitted to
 
05:12:02.110 --> 05:12:02.120 align:start position:0%
us because um there was a constituent
 
05:12:05.830 --> 05:12:05.840 align:start position:0%
who had difficulty in paying with cash
 
05:12:09.150 --> 05:12:09.160 align:start position:0%
at um State agencies especially the
 
05:12:13.390 --> 05:12:13.400 align:start position:0%
turnpike and upon speaking to
 
05:12:16.548 --> 05:12:16.558 align:start position:0%
um Mr Arling house commissioner Arling
 
05:12:20.350 --> 05:12:20.360 align:start position:0%
house and um it seems that All State
 
05:12:24.230 --> 05:12:24.240 align:start position:0%
agencies take cash except for the toll
 
05:12:26.390 --> 05:12:26.400 align:start position:0%
boots on sping turpike and it's highly
 
05:12:28.350 --> 05:12:28.360 align:start position:0%
unlikely that we're going
 
05:12:33.510 --> 05:12:33.520 align:start position:0%
to um pay someone to um collect cash
 
05:12:35.910 --> 05:12:35.920 align:start position:0%
there but there are
 
05:12:35.920 --> 05:12:37.430 align:start position:0%
there but there are
non-traceable

05:12:37.430 --> 05:12:37.440 align:start position:0%
non-traceable
 
05:12:40.590 --> 05:12:40.600 align:start position:0%
um easy passes that you can get that
 
05:12:45.310 --> 05:12:45.320 align:start position:0%
would allow individuals to um use that
 
05:12:48.270 --> 05:12:48.280 align:start position:0%
so I didn't we didn't it wasn't I didn't
 
05:12:50.708 --> 05:12:50.718 align:start position:0%
think this bill was
 
05:12:53.110 --> 05:12:53.120 align:start position:0%
necessary I'd like to say that I spent
 
05:12:55.788 --> 05:12:55.798 align:start position:0%
some time talking with someone from the
 
05:12:57.868 --> 05:12:57.878 align:start position:0%
Department of Transportation about those
 
05:13:01.030 --> 05:13:01.040 align:start position:0%
toll boots and there are at least three
 
05:13:03.670 --> 05:13:03.680 align:start position:0%
different ways you can set up a cash
 
05:13:06.350 --> 05:13:06.360 align:start position:0%
program the simplest is that you will
 
05:13:08.708 --> 05:13:08.718 align:start position:0%
not is just go through the tolls without
 
05:13:12.150 --> 05:13:12.160 align:start position:0%
paying and once a week go in and pay
 
05:13:14.150 --> 05:13:14.160 align:start position:0%
your previous week's tolls because you
 
05:13:17.150 --> 05:13:17.160 align:start position:0%
won't get charged a a fee until it's at
 
05:13:19.948 --> 05:13:19.958 align:start position:0%
least eight days so you can and they do
 
05:13:22.390 --> 05:13:22.400 align:start position:0%
take cash at the uh at the service
 
05:13:23.948 --> 05:13:23.958 align:start position:0%
stations and there's
 
05:13:28.150 --> 05:13:28.160 align:start position:0%
one near the tolls in I think it's
 
05:13:31.750 --> 05:13:31.760 align:start position:0%
do uh you could also get a trans
 
05:13:34.830 --> 05:13:34.840 align:start position:0%
transponder an Easy Pass transponder and
 
05:13:38.470 --> 05:13:38.480 align:start position:0%
set it up with cash that will not you
 
05:13:41.430 --> 05:13:41.440 align:start position:0%
can either get an anonymously or in your
 
05:13:44.470 --> 05:13:44.480 align:start position:0%
name and that will save you 30% on the
 
05:13:48.230 --> 05:13:48.240 align:start position:0%
tolls which will pay for the cost of the
 
05:13:51.030 --> 05:13:51.040 align:start position:0%
transponder in about two weeks if you're
 
05:13:53.990 --> 05:13:54.000 align:start position:0%
going through once a day so and there
 
05:13:56.270 --> 05:13:56.280 align:start position:0%
are other things you can do
 
05:13:59.310 --> 05:13:59.320 align:start position:0%
but it's a little more difficult if all
 
05:14:02.430 --> 05:14:02.440 align:start position:0%
you have is Cash you but but it is
 
05:14:06.270 --> 05:14:06.280 align:start position:0%
it can be managed without extra fees and
 
05:14:09.510 --> 05:14:09.520 align:start position:0%
I think that considering the cost of
 
05:14:11.868 --> 05:14:11.878 align:start position:0%
having somebody out there
 
05:14:15.910 --> 05:14:15.920 align:start position:0%
taking of collecting the tolls it's not
 
05:14:19.110 --> 05:14:19.120 align:start position:0%
worth reinstituting toll collectors to
 
05:14:23.190 --> 05:14:23.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:25.270 --> 05:14:25.280 align:start position:0%
aggravation because everybody else is
 
05:14:27.830 --> 05:14:27.840 align:start position:0%
going to be paying for the uh the toll
 
05:14:30.110 --> 05:14:30.120 align:start position:0%
collectors representative cik thank you
 
05:14:31.868 --> 05:14:31.878 align:start position:0%
so much I I just want to say as someone
 
05:14:33.510 --> 05:14:33.520 align:start position:0%
who regularly drives the spaling
 
05:14:36.430 --> 05:14:36.440 align:start position:0%
turnpike and uh now gets to drive them
 
05:14:38.310 --> 05:14:38.320 align:start position:0%
much more efficiently because there
 
05:14:40.708 --> 05:14:40.718 align:start position:0%
aren't the cash Lanes of the two lanes
 
05:14:43.230 --> 05:14:43.240 align:start position:0%
that we have um it's also become much
 
05:14:46.270 --> 05:14:46.280 align:start position:0%
safer because we're not having traffic
 
05:14:47.830 --> 05:14:47.840 align:start position:0%
that is driving unfortunately at
 
05:14:51.510 --> 05:14:51.520 align:start position:0%
excessive speed suddenly breaking from
 
05:14:54.270 --> 05:14:54.280 align:start position:0%
uh by 50 to 60 miles per hour in a
 
05:14:56.070 --> 05:14:56.080 align:start position:0%
matter of seconds and not necessarily
 
05:14:59.150 --> 05:14:59.160 align:start position:0%
efficiently so um streamlining that
 
05:15:03.110 --> 05:15:03.120 align:start position:0%
process in my opinion is is best
 
05:15:08.350 --> 05:15:08.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:13.470 --> 05:15:13.480 align:start position:0%
and you y thank you madam chair um so
 
05:15:16.430 --> 05:15:16.440 align:start position:0%
I'm in support of this and although I I
 
05:15:17.910 --> 05:15:17.920 align:start position:0%
would like to follow up on
 
05:15:20.270 --> 05:15:20.280 align:start position:0%
representative gr's comments after I'm
 
05:15:20.280 --> 05:15:21.910 align:start position:0%
representative gr's comments after I'm
done

05:15:21.910 --> 05:15:21.920 align:start position:0%
done
 
05:15:26.350 --> 05:15:26.360 align:start position:0%
um many of us probably in in the house
 
05:15:28.670 --> 05:15:28.680 align:start position:0%
have not experienced or maybe even had
 
05:15:32.510 --> 05:15:32.520 align:start position:0%
exposure to a person who could only pay
 
05:15:33.910 --> 05:15:33.920 align:start position:0%
their bills by
 
05:15:36.830 --> 05:15:36.840 align:start position:0%
cash sometimes it happens people are in
 
05:15:38.548 --> 05:15:38.558 align:start position:0%
a bad place they have a bad credit
 
05:15:43.070 --> 05:15:43.080 align:start position:0%
rating they have in fact as as I was
 
05:15:45.110 --> 05:15:45.120 align:start position:0%
have explained to others sometimes you
 
05:15:47.548 --> 05:15:47.558 align:start position:0%
find out that people don't have a bank
 
05:15:49.670 --> 05:15:49.680 align:start position:0%
account and they can't get one because
 
05:15:51.830 --> 05:15:51.840 align:start position:0%
they've had such a difficult time with
 
05:15:54.390 --> 05:15:54.400 align:start position:0%
money they can't get a they can't get a
 
05:15:56.230 --> 05:15:56.240 align:start position:0%
bank account they can't have a debit
 
05:15:59.670 --> 05:15:59.680 align:start position:0%
card there and a lot of these
 
05:16:02.590 --> 05:16:02.600 align:start position:0%
people work on a Cash basis they'll go
 
05:16:04.708 --> 05:16:04.718 align:start position:0%
to Walmart and cash their paycheck so
 
05:16:06.788 --> 05:16:06.798 align:start position:0%
they have cash in their hand and then
 
05:16:08.310 --> 05:16:08.320 align:start position:0%
maybe they have to do money orders at
 
05:16:09.788 --> 05:16:09.798 align:start position:0%
Walmart to pay their bills they don't
 
05:16:11.350 --> 05:16:11.360 align:start position:0%
have a checkbook they don't have any way
 
05:16:14.510 --> 05:16:14.520 align:start position:0%
to do that I think
 
05:16:17.070 --> 05:16:17.080 align:start position:0%
that it's important for us to consider
 
05:16:19.150 --> 05:16:19.160 align:start position:0%
that and say that everyone should have a
 
05:16:22.030 --> 05:16:22.040 align:start position:0%
a chance to pay their bill as necessary
 
05:16:25.310 --> 05:16:25.320 align:start position:0%
and as I said from from
 
05:16:27.990 --> 05:16:28.000 align:start position:0%
16006 We're the state we aren't a
 
05:16:30.230 --> 05:16:30.240 align:start position:0%
commercial entity commercial entities
 
05:16:31.590 --> 05:16:31.600 align:start position:0%
are trying to do everything they can can
 
05:16:34.030 --> 05:16:34.040 align:start position:0%
to make money to not have you call them
 
05:16:35.628 --> 05:16:35.638 align:start position:0%
on the phone or not have you pay cash
 
05:16:37.830 --> 05:16:37.840 align:start position:0%
and to do everything online that's not
 
05:16:39.190 --> 05:16:39.200 align:start position:0%
who we are at the state we're public
 
05:16:41.390 --> 05:16:41.400 align:start position:0%
servants we're supposed to be providing
 
05:16:44.030 --> 05:16:44.040 align:start position:0%
service to the people that need it so I
 
05:16:46.670 --> 05:16:46.680 align:start position:0%
think that allowing a person to have
 
05:16:49.990 --> 05:16:50.000 align:start position:0%
cash payments I think is necessary that
 
05:16:53.190 --> 05:16:53.200 align:start position:0%
being said um the sponsor as we saw at
 
05:16:54.830 --> 05:16:54.840 align:start position:0%
the hearing the sponsor had never
 
05:16:56.670 --> 05:16:56.680 align:start position:0%
thought about the toll booths that's
 
05:16:58.350 --> 05:16:58.360 align:start position:0%
something until I came up in in a
 
05:17:00.070 --> 05:17:00.080 align:start position:0%
question that that she hadn't thought
 
05:17:05.390 --> 05:17:05.400 align:start position:0%
about and obviously we can't uh uh
 
05:17:07.548 --> 05:17:07.558 align:start position:0%
restaff toll booths for the few people
 
05:17:09.190 --> 05:17:09.200 align:start position:0%
that can't pay cash and that that would
 
05:17:11.030 --> 05:17:11.040 align:start position:0%
have that's an outlier on this although
 
05:17:13.430 --> 05:17:13.440 align:start position:0%
there are some solutions so that's kind
 
05:17:15.070 --> 05:17:15.080 align:start position:0%
of how I feel on it but I'd like to
 
05:17:16.708 --> 05:17:16.718 align:start position:0%
follow up with representative Grody you
 
05:17:19.350 --> 05:17:19.360 align:start position:0%
talked to
 
05:17:22.628 --> 05:17:22.638 align:start position:0%
um thank you and can can you maybe
 
05:17:25.670 --> 05:17:25.680 align:start position:0%
elaborate a little bit more on what that
 
05:17:28.190 --> 05:17:28.200 align:start position:0%
he said about he checked all the state
 
05:17:31.070 --> 05:17:31.080 align:start position:0%
agencies that deal with the public and
 
05:17:34.948 --> 05:17:34.958 align:start position:0%
they all have the ability to take cash
 
05:17:38.350 --> 05:17:38.360 align:start position:0%
so and I hope that
 
05:17:41.670 --> 05:17:41.680 align:start position:0%
my expedient way of explaining that did
 
05:17:45.150 --> 05:17:45.160 align:start position:0%
not indicate my any callousness towards
 
05:17:48.628 --> 05:17:48.638 align:start position:0%
anyone who would be in any financial
 
05:17:51.670 --> 05:17:51.680 align:start position:0%
position that would only allow them and
 
05:17:53.670 --> 05:17:53.680 align:start position:0%
that's their prerogative I mean they
 
05:17:56.628 --> 05:17:56.638 align:start position:0%
could be some people only deal in cash
 
05:18:00.030 --> 05:18:00.040 align:start position:0%
okay so um I just feel that since it's
 
05:18:02.750 --> 05:18:02.760 align:start position:0%
available we should it's not something
 
05:18:05.948 --> 05:18:05.958 align:start position:0%
that we need to direct agencies to
 
05:18:09.628 --> 05:18:09.638 align:start position:0%
do may may Madam shair follow up and
 
05:18:11.190 --> 05:18:11.200 align:start position:0%
then representative Schmidt yeah thank
 
05:18:12.470 --> 05:18:12.480 align:start position:0%
you Representative groa no I didn't
 
05:18:14.548 --> 05:18:14.558 align:start position:0%
think that in the leaste that's not not
 
05:18:17.350 --> 05:18:17.360 align:start position:0%
at all thank you representative
 
05:18:21.030 --> 05:18:21.040 align:start position:0%
Schmidt thank you madam chair well I
 
05:18:23.628 --> 05:18:23.638 align:start position:0%
recall like 50 years ago when I was
 
05:18:27.868 --> 05:18:27.878 align:start position:0%
working in Chicago in a patent law
 
05:18:31.788 --> 05:18:31.798 align:start position:0%
office and we had uh everyone of the
 
05:18:31.798 --> 05:18:33.868 align:start position:0%
office and we had uh everyone of the
patent

05:18:33.868 --> 05:18:33.878 align:start position:0%
patent
 
05:18:37.948 --> 05:18:37.958 align:start position:0%
attorneys had a a girl that's the way
 
05:18:40.150 --> 05:18:40.160 align:start position:0%
they called him in those days they were
 
05:18:43.590 --> 05:18:43.600 align:start position:0%
overwhelming the women uh and and most
 
05:18:47.990 --> 05:18:48.000 align:start position:0%
of them uh were very fine people see all
 
05:18:51.150 --> 05:18:51.160 align:start position:0%
seem to be well very well educated they
 
05:18:55.110 --> 05:18:55.120 align:start position:0%
all belong to a particular uh uh
 
05:18:58.590 --> 05:18:58.600 align:start position:0%
European ethnic group and every every
 
05:19:02.030 --> 05:19:02.040 align:start position:0%
payday they took their their ship their
 
05:19:04.910 --> 05:19:04.920 align:start position:0%
paycheck and went downstairs to the bank
 
05:19:07.150 --> 05:19:07.160 align:start position:0%
this was in the SE 70th floor of the
 
05:19:10.670 --> 05:19:10.680 align:start position:0%
Sears Tower Bank was in the on the first
 
05:19:12.990 --> 05:19:13.000 align:start position:0%
floor they went down and cash our
 
05:19:15.590 --> 05:19:15.600 align:start position:0%
paycheck uh and so forth and I was kind
 
05:19:17.670 --> 05:19:17.680 align:start position:0%
of as stunned at the idea that people
 
05:19:20.750 --> 05:19:20.760 align:start position:0%
who were in the patent law business and
 
05:19:24.548 --> 05:19:24.558 align:start position:0%
on one on one end were had people who
 
05:19:27.190 --> 05:19:27.200 align:start position:0%
were cashing their checks I'm going like
 
05:19:29.788 --> 05:19:29.798 align:start position:0%
all that money all that wasted so forth
 
05:19:32.990 --> 05:19:33.000 align:start position:0%
and so on but now
 
05:19:36.670 --> 05:19:36.680 align:start position:0%
50 years later uh the the bottom line is
 
05:19:38.190 --> 05:19:38.200 align:start position:0%
we don't we don't even think about it
 
05:19:39.788 --> 05:19:39.798 align:start position:0%
because we've all got a transponder
 
05:19:42.190 --> 05:19:42.200 align:start position:0%
right or if we want one anyway because
 
05:19:45.070 --> 05:19:45.080 align:start position:0%
we're in the house um and the balding
 
05:19:47.830 --> 05:19:47.840 align:start position:0%
now is clean and green you just get on a
 
05:19:49.948 --> 05:19:49.958 align:start position:0%
one end and you never stop again until
 
05:19:53.350 --> 05:19:53.360 align:start position:0%
your car runs out of gas if you've got a
 
05:19:56.830 --> 05:19:56.840 align:start position:0%
car that still burns gas so the bottom
 
05:20:01.190 --> 05:20:01.200 align:start position:0%
line is but the the this was a little
 
05:20:03.590 --> 05:20:03.600 align:start position:0%
humorous interlude I hope but that we
 
05:20:06.750 --> 05:20:06.760 align:start position:0%
are also state representatives that have
 
05:20:08.948 --> 05:20:08.958 align:start position:0%
constituencies and many of us are in
 
05:20:13.310 --> 05:20:13.320 align:start position:0%
small towns or we're pretty close to the
 
05:20:16.510 --> 05:20:16.520 align:start position:0%
the the center of government in our town
 
05:20:19.070 --> 05:20:19.080 align:start position:0%
so I suggest that we talk with them
 
05:20:22.030 --> 05:20:22.040 align:start position:0%
about how they deal with that situation
 
05:20:25.548 --> 05:20:25.558 align:start position:0%
because the state doesn't want to put
 
05:20:29.270 --> 05:20:29.280 align:start position:0%
toll collectors back on the toll toll uh
 
05:20:31.750 --> 05:20:31.760 align:start position:0%
highways that's not going to happen
 
05:20:33.310 --> 05:20:33.320 align:start position:0%
but we have to be mindful of the fact
 
05:20:35.110 --> 05:20:35.120 align:start position:0%
that there are people a lot of people
 
05:20:36.910 --> 05:20:36.920 align:start position:0%
out there that we probably don't even
 
05:20:39.230 --> 05:20:39.240 align:start position:0%
think about it that are still paying
 
05:20:42.788 --> 05:20:42.798 align:start position:0%
cash for everything and and and we have
 
05:20:47.430 --> 05:20:47.440 align:start position:0%
to I so let's talk with our local
 
05:20:50.628 --> 05:20:50.638 align:start position:0%
um with our local government and see how
 
05:20:52.910 --> 05:20:52.920 align:start position:0%
they deal with it because it could be
 
05:20:56.150 --> 05:20:56.160 align:start position:0%
that we have to make some additional
 
05:20:58.990 --> 05:20:59.000 align:start position:0%
adjustments at the state level because
 
05:21:01.708 --> 05:21:01.718 align:start position:0%
we can't push down on the
 
05:21:04.030 --> 05:21:04.040 align:start position:0%
28a says we can't push things down on
 
05:21:07.190 --> 05:21:07.200 align:start position:0%
the towns but let's find out how our
 
05:21:09.548 --> 05:21:09.558 align:start position:0%
towns how our constituents are dealing
 
05:21:11.910 --> 05:21:11.920 align:start position:0%
with people who will only pay cash
 
05:21:14.948 --> 05:21:14.958 align:start position:0%
because we need to know that and this
 
05:21:19.390 --> 05:21:19.400 align:start position:0%
bill bangs Us in the head with a larger
 
05:21:22.948 --> 05:21:22.958 align:start position:0%
2x4 representative gold thank you madam
 
05:21:26.230 --> 05:21:26.240 align:start position:0%
chair and um to representative Schmidt's
 
05:21:28.750 --> 05:21:28.760 align:start position:0%
point at the full Committee hearing I
 
05:21:31.030 --> 05:21:31.040 align:start position:0%
think I reported that I had uh gotten a
 
05:21:32.230 --> 05:21:32.240 align:start position:0%
parking ticket and didn't want my
 
05:21:33.948 --> 05:21:33.958 align:start position:0%
husband to know and tried to go into the
 
05:21:36.990 --> 05:21:37.000 align:start position:0%
conquered Police Department to pay cash
 
05:21:39.670 --> 05:21:39.680 align:start position:0%
and they refused to accept it I'm happy
 
05:21:41.830 --> 05:21:41.840 align:start position:0%
to report that very day that I reported
 
05:21:43.190 --> 05:21:43.200 align:start position:0%
that in this committee meeting I went
 
05:21:45.628 --> 05:21:45.638 align:start position:0%
out and I had a parking ticket and when
 
05:21:48.470 --> 05:21:48.480 align:start position:0%
my husband got online to pay it he saw
 
05:21:50.190 --> 05:21:50.200 align:start position:0%
that you can pay cash at the conquered
 
05:21:51.750 --> 05:21:51.760 align:start position:0%
police department so I do think we're
 
05:21:55.230 --> 05:21:55.240 align:start position:0%
seeing a a return to municipalities
 
05:21:57.150 --> 05:21:57.160 align:start position:0%
accepting cash payments and I just
 
05:21:59.150 --> 05:21:59.160 align:start position:0%
wanted to reassure you but I like your
 
05:22:00.548 --> 05:22:00.558 align:start position:0%
point we should all check in our own
 
05:22:00.558 --> 05:22:01.708 align:start position:0%
point we should all check in our own
municip

05:22:01.708 --> 05:22:01.718 align:start position:0%
municip
 
05:22:04.190 --> 05:22:04.200 align:start position:0%
if I may I mean the thing is that it it
 
05:22:09.548 --> 05:22:09.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:14.390 --> 05:22:14.400 align:start position:0%
locality want but that if let's ask them
 
05:22:17.270 --> 05:22:17.280 align:start position:0%
how they handle it and then if if the
 
05:22:19.350 --> 05:22:19.360 align:start position:0%
people can come in and pay their their
 
05:22:19.360 --> 05:22:20.830 align:start position:0%
people can come in and pay their their
state

05:22:20.830 --> 05:22:20.840 align:start position:0%
state
 
05:22:24.628 --> 05:22:24.638 align:start position:0%
Bill State charge at their
 
05:22:27.470 --> 05:22:27.480 align:start position:0%
locality the the towns are all dealing
 
05:22:29.868 --> 05:22:29.878 align:start position:0%
with the state so let's just find out
 
05:22:31.708 --> 05:22:31.718 align:start position:0%
more I'm sure we can
 
05:22:34.030 --> 05:22:34.040 align:start position:0%
profit from more
 
05:22:37.190 --> 05:22:37.200 align:start position:0%
information representative Shu thank you
 
05:22:42.190 --> 05:22:42.200 align:start position:0%
madam chair um as someone whose late
 
05:22:44.670 --> 05:22:44.680 align:start position:0%
brother-in-law was exactly the person
 
05:22:46.910 --> 05:22:46.920 align:start position:0%
that representative Brown was
 
05:22:49.910 --> 05:22:49.920 align:start position:0%
describing could not keep a bank account
 
05:22:53.350 --> 05:22:53.360 align:start position:0%
cashed his Social Security checks at
 
05:22:55.948 --> 05:22:55.958 align:start position:0%
Walmart um but even he with his
 
05:22:55.958 --> 05:22:57.430 align:start position:0%
Walmart um but even he with his
disabilities

05:22:57.430 --> 05:22:57.440 align:start position:0%
disabilities
 
05:23:00.070 --> 05:23:00.080 align:start position:0%
learned about a place where he could get
 
05:23:01.708 --> 05:23:01.718 align:start position:0%
money orders
 
05:23:03.708 --> 05:23:03.718 align:start position:0%
I think they allowed three a
 
05:23:06.590 --> 05:23:06.600 align:start position:0%
month uh he and my sister paid most of
 
05:23:09.788 --> 05:23:09.798 align:start position:0%
their utility bills in cash but the
 
05:23:13.110 --> 05:23:13.120 align:start position:0%
instances where he could not use cash he
 
05:23:16.350 --> 05:23:16.360 align:start position:0%
would get a money order and send it to
 
05:23:18.670 --> 05:23:18.680 align:start position:0%
or take it to whatever Place needed to
 
05:23:22.430 --> 05:23:22.440 align:start position:0%
be paid so there are ways that folks
 
05:23:26.548 --> 05:23:26.558 align:start position:0%
that have these problems can deal with
 
05:23:29.670 --> 05:23:29.680 align:start position:0%
things uh it may be a matter of
 
05:23:31.510 --> 05:23:31.520 align:start position:0%
education but
 
05:23:33.470 --> 05:23:33.480 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to point that out thank
 
05:23:35.590 --> 05:23:35.600 align:start position:0%
you repr
 
05:23:37.990 --> 05:23:38.000 align:start position:0%
Gart thank you madam
 
05:23:41.150 --> 05:23:41.160 align:start position:0%
chair what happened to having the toll
 
05:23:43.190 --> 05:23:43.200 align:start position:0%
booths take coins and then the little
 
05:23:44.910 --> 05:23:44.920 align:start position:0%
gate opens up and there is no person
 
05:23:46.470 --> 05:23:46.480 align:start position:0%
necessary that's the first thing and the
 
05:23:47.830 --> 05:23:47.840 align:start position:0%
second thing with this is I think the
 
05:23:51.070 --> 05:23:51.080 align:start position:0%
bigger issue is an uh anonymity and the
 
05:23:53.150 --> 05:23:53.160 align:start position:0%
fact that people don't always want the
 
05:23:55.390 --> 05:23:55.400 align:start position:0%
government at all levels especially the
 
05:23:57.470 --> 05:23:57.480 align:start position:0%
higher up level want knowing what you're
 
05:23:58.990 --> 05:23:59.000 align:start position:0%
doing with your money so I think just
 
05:24:01.110 --> 05:24:01.120 align:start position:0%
the idea that if cash is legal tender
 
05:24:03.868 --> 05:24:03.878 align:start position:0%
then it should be accepted everywhere so
 
05:24:07.788 --> 05:24:07.798 align:start position:0%
thank you yes and I will I will report
 
05:24:09.510 --> 05:24:09.520 align:start position:0%
that when I was at the Secretary of
 
05:24:09.520 --> 05:24:11.190 align:start position:0%
that when I was at the Secretary of
State's

05:24:11.190 --> 05:24:11.200 align:start position:0%
State's
 
05:24:14.628 --> 05:24:14.638 align:start position:0%
office earlier this week filing
 
05:24:18.830 --> 05:24:18.840 align:start position:0%
a a business uh application the person
 
05:24:21.750 --> 05:24:21.760 align:start position:0%
at the next window was taking $50 bills
 
05:24:25.788 --> 05:24:25.798 align:start position:0%
out of his wallet to pay for for his uh
 
05:24:28.590 --> 05:24:28.600 align:start position:0%
similar license so they do take cash and
 
05:24:30.150 --> 05:24:30.160 align:start position:0%
checks which is why I was there because
 
05:24:31.868 --> 05:24:31.878 align:start position:0%
I didn't didn't have a credit card for
 
05:24:31.878 --> 05:24:34.190 align:start position:0%
I didn't didn't have a credit card for
the

05:24:34.190 --> 05:24:34.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:37.350 --> 05:24:37.360 align:start position:0%
business so yeah the tolls are a
 
05:24:39.350 --> 05:24:39.360 align:start position:0%
specific case and but there are ways
 
05:24:42.830 --> 05:24:42.840 align:start position:0%
around it representative Bailey I'm I'm
 
05:24:46.948 --> 05:24:46.958 align:start position:0%
inclined to this had problems to friend
 
05:24:49.390 --> 05:24:49.400 align:start position:0%
example but I would point out that what
 
05:24:50.990 --> 05:24:51.000 align:start position:0%
it says on all your bills you can look
 
05:24:53.350 --> 05:24:53.360 align:start position:0%
in your wallet is this is legal tender
 
05:24:55.788 --> 05:24:55.798 align:start position:0%
for all debts public and private the
 
05:24:58.350 --> 05:24:58.360 align:start position:0%
cash money I believe it's already
 
05:25:02.110 --> 05:25:02.120 align:start position:0%
illegal to not accept paper
 
05:25:10.590 --> 05:25:10.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:12.788 --> 05:25:12.798 align:start position:0%
tender well there are there are places
 
05:25:14.350 --> 05:25:14.360 align:start position:0%
out there that will not take anything
 
05:25:14.360 --> 05:25:16.430 align:start position:0%
out there that will not take anything
over

05:25:16.430 --> 05:25:16.440 align:start position:0%
over
 
05:25:19.628 --> 05:25:19.638 align:start position:0%
20 representative Mani thank you madam
 
05:25:22.430 --> 05:25:22.440 align:start position:0%
chair just going back to the easy path
 
05:25:25.390 --> 05:25:25.400 align:start position:0%
there is a path where you can get prea
 
05:25:27.948 --> 05:25:27.958 align:start position:0%
transponder that you pay money ahead of
 
05:25:30.788 --> 05:25:30.798 align:start position:0%
time and when you run out you run out so
 
05:25:35.110 --> 05:25:35.120 align:start position:0%
you can go refill it and that is an one
 
05:25:37.788 --> 05:25:37.798 align:start position:0%
of the options and I had one of the
 
05:25:40.750 --> 05:25:40.760 align:start position:0%
constituents who did not want to pay
 
05:25:42.868 --> 05:25:42.878 align:start position:0%
they got that and what you talked about
 
05:25:46.230 --> 05:25:46.240 align:start position:0%
Madame chair they were out of country or
 
05:25:48.510 --> 05:25:48.520 align:start position:0%
whatever for two weeks so they had to
 
05:25:50.670 --> 05:25:50.680 align:start position:0%
pay penalty they went through the toll
 
05:25:53.150 --> 05:25:53.160 align:start position:0%
they got the uh thing but if they had
 
05:25:55.628 --> 05:25:55.638 align:start position:0%
gone back and paid it within the week
 
05:25:58.350 --> 05:25:58.360 align:start position:0%
there won't be any penalty and it'll be
 
05:26:01.350 --> 05:26:01.360 align:start position:0%
mailed and your car is reg registered
 
05:26:04.430 --> 05:26:04.440 align:start position:0%
anyways so you can't hide the fact that
 
05:26:07.750 --> 05:26:07.760 align:start position:0%
where the registration is addressed to
 
05:26:10.150 --> 05:26:10.160 align:start position:0%
so that is if you don't want to go
 
05:26:12.390 --> 05:26:12.400 align:start position:0%
through toll then you don't have to but
 
05:26:15.990 --> 05:26:16.000 align:start position:0%
your registered car will go through that
 
05:26:19.868 --> 05:26:19.878 align:start position:0%
so there are options and you know it's
 
05:26:22.548 --> 05:26:22.558 align:start position:0%
just a matter of finding those options
 
05:26:25.510 --> 05:26:25.520 align:start position:0%
to work thank
 
05:26:29.350 --> 05:26:29.360 align:start position:0%

not you don't have to speak to it all
 
05:27:55.030 --> 05:27:55.040 align:start position:0%
right we'll put this on the regular
 
05:27:57.590 --> 05:27:57.600 align:start position:0%
calendar since there appears to be some
 
05:28:00.150 --> 05:28:00.160 align:start position:0%
concern does anyone write want to write
 
05:28:04.190 --> 05:28:04.200 align:start position:0%
a Minority Report I I will do that okay
 
05:28:06.350 --> 05:28:06.360 align:start position:0%
and represent Brown will write The
 
05:28:09.830 --> 05:28:09.840 align:start position:0%
Minority Report not a bad idea for the
 
05:28:12.070 --> 05:28:12.080 align:start position:0%
rest of the house to at least
 
05:28:15.548 --> 05:28:15.558 align:start position:0%
momentarily think about this we heard
 
05:28:18.430 --> 05:28:18.440 align:start position:0%
these stories but and thought about it
 
05:28:20.190 --> 05:28:20.200 align:start position:0%
okay Ross that's
 
05:28:25.670 --> 05:28:25.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:28.628 --> 05:28:28.638 align:start position:0%
one representative Bailey you have a
 
05:28:30.990 --> 05:28:31.000 align:start position:0%
motion on House Bill 12
 
05:28:34.510 --> 05:28:34.520 align:start position:0%
1272 yes I'd like to move itl on House
 
05:28:37.270 --> 05:28:37.280 align:start position:0%
Bill 1272
 
05:28:39.910 --> 05:28:39.920 align:start position:0%
FM uh I'll
 
05:28:43.070 --> 05:28:43.080 align:start position:0%
second okay do you wish to speak to your
 
05:28:45.868 --> 05:28:45.878 align:start position:0%
motion I understand there's a potential
 
05:28:49.670 --> 05:28:49.680 align:start position:0%
conflict or problem could be created uh
 
05:28:50.830 --> 05:28:50.840 align:start position:0%
in that
 
05:28:55.030 --> 05:28:55.040 align:start position:0%
this uses the term remarkably Sim uh
 
05:28:57.670 --> 05:28:57.680 align:start position:0%
reasonably similar which has the
 
05:28:59.830 --> 05:28:59.840 align:start position:0%
potential to conflict with existing
 
05:29:02.590 --> 05:29:02.600 align:start position:0%
things that a scope of practice that
 
05:29:04.830 --> 05:29:04.840 align:start position:0%
have Divine particular scopes of
 
05:29:07.830 --> 05:29:07.840 align:start position:0%
practice and this would allow in things
 
05:29:11.070 --> 05:29:11.080 align:start position:0%
that are not that must be called similar
 
05:29:13.070 --> 05:29:13.080 align:start position:0%
because they have the same
 
05:29:16.910 --> 05:29:16.920 align:start position:0%
name and perhaps are not
 
05:29:20.510 --> 05:29:20.520 align:start position:0%
similar okay representing
 
05:29:27.868 --> 05:29:27.878 align:start position:0%

reciprocity Bill last year and it is
 
05:29:40.430 --> 05:29:40.440 align:start position:0%
still being implemented in rules and I I
 
05:29:43.750 --> 05:29:43.760 align:start position:0%
think it's wise not to change the ground
 
05:29:47.150 --> 05:29:47.160 align:start position:0%
rules until we finished establishing the
 
05:29:50.788 --> 05:29:50.798 align:start position:0%

we agreed in the end that it's not quite
 
05:32:07.670 --> 05:32:07.680 align:start position:0%
ready but given a little time and a bit
 
05:32:10.350 --> 05:32:10.360 align:start position:0%
more work it could address areas that
 
05:32:13.310 --> 05:32:13.320 align:start position:0%

representative grod's uh Amendment she's

05:32:28.830 --> 05:32:28.840 align:start position:0%
we did interim study rather than itl
 
05:32:30.390 --> 05:32:30.400 align:start position:0%
because we didn't want to do something
 
05:32:33.030 --> 05:32:33.040 align:start position:0%
that would stand in the way of
 
05:32:37.070 --> 05:32:37.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:41.070 --> 05:32:41.080 align:start position:0%

then ought to pass as amended but I
 
05:35:21.868 --> 05:35:21.878 align:start position:0%
think that um voting for the amendment
 
05:35:24.590 --> 05:35:24.600 align:start position:0%
to the original bill is still a good
 
05:35:28.788 --> 05:35:28.798 align:start position:0%
move as as this continues on in its
 
05:35:28.798 --> 05:35:31.548 align:start position:0%
move as as this continues on in its
process

05:35:31.548 --> 05:35:31.558 align:start position:0%

the Veterans Administration people uh
 
05:35:47.788 --> 05:35:47.798 align:start position:0%
around the language of that part of the
 
05:35:47.798 --> 05:35:49.708 align:start position:0%

05:36:05.910 --> 05:36:05.920 align:start position:0%
you know it says it takes the language
 
05:36:07.590 --> 05:36:07.600 align:start position:0%
that had said to an appropriate position
 
05:36:09.990 --> 05:36:10.000 align:start position:0%
or other health care professional to
 
05:36:11.830 --> 05:36:11.840 align:start position:0%
appropriate member of the health care
 
05:36:15.708 --> 05:36:15.718 align:start position:0%

amended right so my con
 
05:39:50.070 --> 05:39:50.080 align:start position:0%
my this bill I'm I'm sure everyone's not
 
05:39:51.510 --> 05:39:51.520 align:start position:0%
going to be surprised to hear it's not
 
05:39:53.070 --> 05:39:53.080 align:start position:0%
it's not one of my favorite
 
05:39:55.948 --> 05:39:55.958 align:start position:0%
bills um there have been certain things
 
05:39:58.110 --> 05:39:58.120 align:start position:0%
along this has been this has had a very
 
05:40:00.510 --> 05:40:00.520 align:start position:0%
bumpy road
 
05:40:04.270 --> 05:40:04.280 align:start position:0%
first of all um there was no
 
05:40:06.350 --> 05:40:06.360 align:start position:0%
collaboration from the physic from the
 
05:40:08.590 --> 05:40:08.600 align:start position:0%
Pas with anybody from the Board of
 
05:40:10.708 --> 05:40:10.718 align:start position:0%
Nursing or anyone from the Board of
 
05:40:12.590 --> 05:40:12.600 align:start position:0%
Medicine and these are people that
 
05:40:14.350 --> 05:40:14.360 align:start position:0%
they're supposed to collaborate with and
 
05:40:16.190 --> 05:40:16.200 align:start position:0%
there was no discussion with them about
 
05:40:20.190 --> 05:40:20.200 align:start position:0%
this bill number one number two there
 
05:40:22.230 --> 05:40:22.240 align:start position:0%
was no discussion about how the scope of
 
05:40:23.990 --> 05:40:24.000 align:start position:0%
practice was going to change because
 
05:40:25.948 --> 05:40:25.958 align:start position:0%
within the collab within the scope of
 
05:40:27.990 --> 05:40:28.000 align:start position:0%
practice collaboration between the
 
05:40:31.110 --> 05:40:31.120 align:start position:0%
Physicians plays a very important part
 
05:40:35.468 --> 05:40:35.478 align:start position:0%
these individuals are called physician
 
05:40:38.350 --> 05:40:38.360 align:start position:0%
assistants and there's a reason for
 
05:40:41.830 --> 05:40:41.840 align:start position:0%
that number two three we were told that
 
05:40:44.468 --> 05:40:44.478 align:start position:0%
other states have adopted this and Maine
 
05:40:46.390 --> 05:40:46.400 align:start position:0%
was one of them and indeed Maine did
 
05:40:48.548 --> 05:40:48.558 align:start position:0%
adopt a bill but it is not this bill
 
05:40:51.110 --> 05:40:51.120 align:start position:0%
it's quite different than this bill and
 
05:40:52.468 --> 05:40:52.478 align:start position:0%
this morning we heard that the Board of
 
05:40:55.868 --> 05:40:55.878 align:start position:0%
Medicine has indeed agreed with the Pas
 
05:40:59.628 --> 05:40:59.638 align:start position:0%
on an on a on a relationship and they
 
05:41:02.390 --> 05:41:02.400 align:start position:0%
are willing to put an amendment together
 
05:41:04.070 --> 05:41:04.080 align:start position:0%
which I'm willing to look at but we
 
05:41:05.270 --> 05:41:05.280 align:start position:0%
don't have
 
05:41:08.948 --> 05:41:08.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:12.350 --> 05:41:12.360 align:start position:0%
um it is not this is this is something
 
05:41:16.750 --> 05:41:16.760 align:start position:0%
that started out as I was told and I
 
05:41:19.030 --> 05:41:19.040 align:start position:0%
think that we heard this too that the
 
05:41:20.708 --> 05:41:20.718 align:start position:0%
bill wasn't going to be submitted then
 
05:41:23.430 --> 05:41:23.440 align:start position:0%
it was submitted then it was well you
 
05:41:26.070 --> 05:41:26.080 align:start position:0%
know the Pas are talking about it but
 
05:41:28.390 --> 05:41:28.400 align:start position:0%
nobody else knows about it this is not
 
05:41:31.670 --> 05:41:31.680 align:start position:0%
the way to decide IDE how legislation is
 
05:41:34.270 --> 05:41:34.280 align:start position:0%
made you don't do it this way it's kind
 
05:41:37.230 --> 05:41:37.240 align:start position:0%
of halfhazard this is an important thing
 
05:41:40.190 --> 05:41:40.200 align:start position:0%
we're talking about People's Health Care
 
05:41:42.628 --> 05:41:42.638 align:start position:0%
and it's not something that we can just
 
05:41:44.910 --> 05:41:44.920 align:start position:0%
say flip a switch and go okay let's do
 
05:41:47.590 --> 05:41:47.600 align:start position:0%
it this way and then decide that that's
 
05:41:49.230 --> 05:41:49.240 align:start position:0%
not the way anybody else is doing it so
 
05:41:50.910 --> 05:41:50.920 align:start position:0%
let's do it this way there's just too
 
05:41:55.510 --> 05:41:55.520 align:start position:0%
many moving parts to this so I I I
 
05:41:57.708 --> 05:41:57.718 align:start position:0%
understand the need and the recognition
 
05:42:00.230 --> 05:42:00.240 align:start position:0%
that we want to do something but I would
 
05:42:03.390 --> 05:42:03.400 align:start position:0%
like to um take and I appreciate
 
05:42:05.110 --> 05:42:05.120 align:start position:0%
representative ghoul trying to make an
 
05:42:07.788 --> 05:42:07.798 align:start position:0%
effort to
 
05:42:10.270 --> 05:42:10.280 align:start position:0%
um speak to the
 
05:42:13.190 --> 05:42:13.200 align:start position:0%
bill but I'd like to see what other
 
05:42:16.590 --> 05:42:16.600 align:start position:0%
states are doing because in many of
 
05:42:20.230 --> 05:42:20.240 align:start position:0%
these in in these bills for example the
 
05:42:22.350 --> 05:42:22.360 align:start position:0%
state of Maine has adopted a legislation
 
05:42:25.430 --> 05:42:25.440 align:start position:0%
that does not allow newly graduated
 
05:42:28.190 --> 05:42:28.200 align:start position:0%
students for their physical physician
 
05:42:31.230 --> 05:42:31.240 align:start position:0%
assistance to practice on their own and
 
05:42:32.910 --> 05:42:32.920 align:start position:0%
they need a certain amount of hours
 
05:42:35.190 --> 05:42:35.200 align:start position:0%
before they can practice on their own
 
05:42:37.310 --> 05:42:37.320 align:start position:0%
and I'm I'm willing to take a look at
 
05:42:39.788 --> 05:42:39.798 align:start position:0%
that and I hope that the committee will
 
05:42:42.030 --> 05:42:42.040 align:start position:0%
agree with me that this is something
 
05:42:43.230 --> 05:42:43.240 align:start position:0%
that we should
 
05:42:46.270 --> 05:42:46.280 align:start position:0%
consider and I've said my piece thank
 
05:42:49.070 --> 05:42:49.080 align:start position:0%
you all right that's very interesting
 
05:42:50.788 --> 05:42:50.798 align:start position:0%
represent leus and the
 
05:42:53.310 --> 05:42:53.320 align:start position:0%
meny thank you um yeah I understand the
 
05:42:54.948 --> 05:42:54.958 align:start position:0%
concerns of the process I I wasn't
 
05:42:58.070 --> 05:42:58.080 align:start position:0%
involved in all the history
 
05:43:01.788 --> 05:43:01.798 align:start position:0%
um I mean I would be fine passing this
 
05:43:03.628 --> 05:43:03.638 align:start position:0%
ought to pass as amended I mean I can
 
05:43:05.990 --> 05:43:06.000 align:start position:0%
mention some reasons for that but if
 
05:43:08.430 --> 05:43:08.440 align:start position:0%
it's you know if there's some process
 
05:43:12.468 --> 05:43:12.478 align:start position:0%
for and also from the uh I think Mr kzy
 
05:43:14.830 --> 05:43:14.840 align:start position:0%
I don't know if he's here uh he I we
 
05:43:16.948 --> 05:43:16.958 align:start position:0%
spoke with him earlier and he said the
 
05:43:18.628 --> 05:43:18.638 align:start position:0%
Board of Medicine would be neutral on
 
05:43:21.110 --> 05:43:21.120 align:start position:0%
the bill as it stands but they would
 
05:43:23.190 --> 05:43:23.200 align:start position:0%
prefer an amendment that required
 
05:43:24.510 --> 05:43:24.520 align:start position:0%
certain things
 
05:43:26.510 --> 05:43:26.520 align:start position:0%
first um and I don't know what the
 
05:43:29.708 --> 05:43:29.718 align:start position:0%
procedure would be to somehow address
 
05:43:32.590 --> 05:43:32.600 align:start position:0%
that but I you know if that's where the
 
05:43:34.910 --> 05:43:34.920 align:start position:0%
committee want the procedure to address
 
05:43:39.270 --> 05:43:39.280 align:start position:0%
it would be to add add language to the
 
05:43:40.948 --> 05:43:40.958 align:start position:0%
bill make an
 
05:43:40.958 --> 05:43:42.510 align:start position:0%
bill make an
amendment

05:43:42.510 --> 05:43:42.520 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
05:43:47.468 --> 05:43:47.478 align:start position:0%
um or pass it as is and hope hope it's
 
05:43:49.030 --> 05:43:49.040 align:start position:0%
fixed in the
 
05:43:51.868 --> 05:43:51.878 align:start position:0%
Senate which I do personally do not
 
05:43:53.628 --> 05:43:53.638 align:start position:0%
recommend if I can ask I mean if to add
 
05:43:56.350 --> 05:43:56.360 align:start position:0%
language what would we do today then get
 
05:43:58.548 --> 05:43:58.558 align:start position:0%
an amendment but oh but we don't have an
 
05:44:00.310 --> 05:44:00.320 align:start position:0%
amendment with drawing
 
05:44:04.150 --> 05:44:04.160 align:start position:0%
motion or we just we just recess it and
 
05:44:06.708 --> 05:44:06.718 align:start position:0%
and come in with another
 
05:44:06.718 --> 05:44:10.990 align:start position:0%
and come in with another
amendment

05:44:10.990 --> 05:44:11.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:14.590 --> 05:44:14.600 align:start position:0%
um representative Mani thank you madam
 
05:44:19.230 --> 05:44:19.240 align:start position:0%
chair um I did um Express this concern
 
05:44:22.030 --> 05:44:22.040 align:start position:0%
looked at it uh from the nurse
 
05:44:25.628 --> 05:44:25.638 align:start position:0%
practitioners versus PA and Pa's
 
05:44:28.390 --> 05:44:28.400 align:start position:0%
physician assistants are still under
 
05:44:32.350 --> 05:44:32.360 align:start position:0%
Medical board and me Physicians are the
 
05:44:34.390 --> 05:44:34.400 align:start position:0%
ones that are setting the scope and
 
05:44:39.070 --> 05:44:39.080 align:start position:0%
supervision and to get them to expand uh
 
05:44:42.948 --> 05:44:42.958 align:start position:0%
the medical uh care provide you know
 
05:44:46.310 --> 05:44:46.320 align:start position:0%
care providers increasing the numbers so
 
05:44:49.948 --> 05:44:49.958 align:start position:0%
that there is quality safety in our
 
05:44:52.948 --> 05:44:52.958 align:start position:0%
state in terms of providing it by
 
05:44:55.750 --> 05:44:55.760 align:start position:0%
suddenly now that you know it's not a
 
05:44:59.230 --> 05:44:59.240 align:start position:0%
small tether that's still hanging but to
 
05:45:03.990 --> 05:45:04.000 align:start position:0%
give the PE that don't have the same um
 
05:45:06.430 --> 05:45:06.440 align:start position:0%
I I shouldn't say not have the same but
 
05:45:11.230 --> 05:45:11.240 align:start position:0%
the education training and the scope of
 
05:45:11.240 --> 05:45:12.948 align:start position:0%
the education training and the scope of
uh

05:45:12.948 --> 05:45:12.958 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:45:15.948 --> 05:45:15.958 align:start position:0%
services are very well defined under
 
05:45:18.548 --> 05:45:18.558 align:start position:0%
Medical Board and suddenly we are not
 
05:45:20.270 --> 05:45:20.280 align:start position:0%
going to be part of that but we are
 
05:45:22.548 --> 05:45:22.558 align:start position:0%
going to be independent they don't have
 
05:45:25.910 --> 05:45:25.920 align:start position:0%
an independent board so we are really
 
05:45:30.350 --> 05:45:30.360 align:start position:0%
putting our Granite Staters safe safety
 
05:45:30.360 --> 05:45:32.070 align:start position:0%
putting our Granite Staters safe safety
basic

05:45:32.070 --> 05:45:32.080 align:start position:0%
basic
 
05:45:32.080 --> 05:45:34.510 align:start position:0%
basic
medical

05:45:34.510 --> 05:45:34.520 align:start position:0%
medical
 
05:45:40.430 --> 05:45:40.440 align:start position:0%
um Health Care at risk by not having
 
05:45:44.390 --> 05:45:44.400 align:start position:0%
that consistency so I mean I couldn't
 
05:45:47.670 --> 05:45:47.680 align:start position:0%
support this we hashed a lot of uh
 
05:45:51.948 --> 05:45:51.958 align:start position:0%
details at the subcommittee and that was
 
05:45:56.150 --> 05:45:56.160 align:start position:0%
you know and I spent few few days the
 
05:45:59.350 --> 05:45:59.360 align:start position:0%
week of uh break
 
05:46:02.430 --> 05:46:02.440 align:start position:0%
uh you know to figure out what you know
 
05:46:06.070 --> 05:46:06.080 align:start position:0%
how is it so it is still not there so I
 
05:46:09.510 --> 05:46:09.520 align:start position:0%
couldn't support it's up to pass all
 
05:46:12.150 --> 05:46:12.160 align:start position:0%
right thank you representative leus and
 
05:46:15.070 --> 05:46:15.080 align:start position:0%
then gold and then Brown okay um yeah I
 
05:46:16.868 --> 05:46:16.878 align:start position:0%
don't share those concerns on the health
 
05:46:19.510 --> 05:46:19.520 align:start position:0%
health stuff although I understand them
 
05:46:21.548 --> 05:46:21.558 align:start position:0%
um I mean it looks like there's two
 
05:46:23.310 --> 05:46:23.320 align:start position:0%
options one is to try and and push
 
05:46:24.708 --> 05:46:24.718 align:start position:0%
through in the vote the motion we have
 
05:46:27.270 --> 05:46:27.280 align:start position:0%
on the floor um uh the other one would
 
05:46:29.230 --> 05:46:29.240 align:start position:0%
be I can withraw the motion and we can
 
05:46:31.670 --> 05:46:31.680 align:start position:0%
consider the amendment I and I I'm
 
05:46:35.150 --> 05:46:35.160 align:start position:0%
leaning towards the latter um I have a I
 
05:46:36.868 --> 05:46:36.878 align:start position:0%
have a number of concerns with this one
 
05:46:40.750 --> 05:46:40.760 align:start position:0%
is you know we heard testimony that
 
05:46:44.390 --> 05:46:44.400 align:start position:0%
um Pas are having first of all that they
 
05:46:45.788 --> 05:46:45.798 align:start position:0%
do have and there somebody else can
 
05:46:48.350 --> 05:46:48.360 align:start position:0%
probably speak more to it but you know
 
05:46:49.788 --> 05:46:49.798 align:start position:0%
while it's a different training path
 
05:46:51.670 --> 05:46:51.680 align:start position:0%
they have similar amounts of training
 
05:46:56.030 --> 05:46:56.040 align:start position:0%
and clinical as uh arnps as
 
05:46:59.390 --> 05:46:59.400 align:start position:0%
NPS um the other
 
05:47:01.830 --> 05:47:01.840 align:start position:0%
um testimony were heard was that
 
05:47:04.708 --> 05:47:04.718 align:start position:0%
Southern New Hampshire Family Practice
 
05:47:06.628 --> 05:47:06.638 align:start position:0%
ended up getting rid of all their Pas
 
05:47:09.310 --> 05:47:09.320 align:start position:0%
and replacing with arnps and we actually
 
05:47:11.270 --> 05:47:11.280 align:start position:0%
you my wife and I deal with them and we
 
05:47:12.510 --> 05:47:12.520 align:start position:0%
wonder why there were no Pas and that
 
05:47:14.468 --> 05:47:14.478 align:start position:0%
was because they had trouble getting
 
05:47:16.270 --> 05:47:16.280 align:start position:0%
doctors to do collaboration agreements
 
05:47:17.990 --> 05:47:18.000 align:start position:0%
but since arnps didn't need them they
 
05:47:20.868 --> 05:47:20.878 align:start position:0%
replaced them with those um and that's I
 
05:47:22.990 --> 05:47:23.000 align:start position:0%
think a serious problem
 
05:47:25.830 --> 05:47:25.840 align:start position:0%
so uh you know my preference would be to
 
05:47:27.990 --> 05:47:28.000 align:start position:0%
pass the Bill W with this amendment that
 
05:47:29.670 --> 05:47:29.680 align:start position:0%
we adopted
 
05:47:31.750 --> 05:47:31.760 align:start position:0%
um for a number of reasons and my and I
 
05:47:33.190 --> 05:47:33.200 align:start position:0%
know there's a proposal to add some
 
05:47:34.788 --> 05:47:34.798 align:start position:0%
number of hours under collaboration if
 
05:47:36.990 --> 05:47:37.000 align:start position:0%
we even have it go away my concern with
 
05:47:39.590 --> 05:47:39.600 align:start position:0%
that is that's that's not going to solve
 
05:47:41.270 --> 05:47:41.280 align:start position:0%
that problem if they're having trouble
 
05:47:43.350 --> 05:47:43.360 align:start position:0%
getting a collaboration agreement um
 
05:47:46.750 --> 05:47:46.760 align:start position:0%
yeah no that other people right and U
 
05:47:48.910 --> 05:47:48.920 align:start position:0%
people lined up I mean I'll I'll listen
 
05:47:50.270 --> 05:47:50.280 align:start position:0%
some more but at least I'm thinking
 
05:47:53.070 --> 05:47:53.080 align:start position:0%
about where to go on this representative
 
05:47:56.670 --> 05:47:56.680 align:start position:0%
Simon thank you madam chair um and I I
 
05:47:59.150 --> 05:47:59.160 align:start position:0%
understand uh some of the frustration on
 
05:48:00.868 --> 05:48:00.878 align:start position:0%
the committee I just wanted to clarify
 
05:48:02.468 --> 05:48:02.478 align:start position:0%
one thing that I believe I remember
 
05:48:04.948 --> 05:48:04.958 align:start position:0%
correctly um from the testimony uh just
 
05:48:07.270 --> 05:48:07.280 align:start position:0%
on behalf of the Pas um they weren't the
 
05:48:09.350 --> 05:48:09.360 align:start position:0%
ones to originally bring the legislation
 
05:48:11.310 --> 05:48:11.320 align:start position:0%
um a couple Representatives did when
 
05:48:12.750 --> 05:48:12.760 align:start position:0%
they found out that the legislation was
 
05:48:15.190 --> 05:48:15.200 align:start position:0%
brought forward um a originally they
 
05:48:16.190 --> 05:48:16.200 align:start position:0%
didn't know what to do with it but then
 
05:48:17.628 --> 05:48:17.638 align:start position:0%
they're like no we really do want this
 
05:48:18.948 --> 05:48:18.958 align:start position:0%
so then they started to support it I
 
05:48:20.230 --> 05:48:20.240 align:start position:0%
believe they supported it in
 
05:48:24.110 --> 05:48:24.120 align:start position:0%
subcommittee um and then um the medical
 
05:48:25.990 --> 05:48:26.000 align:start position:0%
association showed up to testify and I
 
05:48:27.788 --> 05:48:27.798 align:start position:0%
did ask the question there are four
 
05:48:29.868 --> 05:48:29.878 align:start position:0%
states that do do this and I don't
 
05:48:32.468 --> 05:48:32.478 align:start position:0%
believe Maine was one of those States um
 
05:48:34.910 --> 05:48:34.920 align:start position:0%
but uh I asked if there had been any
 
05:48:37.510 --> 05:48:37.520 align:start position:0%
negative Health outcomes from doing that
 
05:48:38.830 --> 05:48:38.840 align:start position:0%
in those other states we never heard
 
05:48:40.350 --> 05:48:40.360 align:start position:0%
back from them so I'm assuming that
 
05:48:42.548 --> 05:48:42.558 align:start position:0%
means that there weren't anything uh
 
05:48:44.030 --> 05:48:44.040 align:start position:0%
there wasn't anything of major concern
 
05:48:45.070 --> 05:48:45.080 align:start position:0%
because they did show up for the
 
05:48:47.110 --> 05:48:47.120 align:start position:0%
subcommittee meetings um but didn't
 
05:48:49.868 --> 05:48:49.878 align:start position:0%
testify to that I just feel like as the
 
05:48:51.830 --> 05:48:51.840 align:start position:0%
process has gone on more and more people
 
05:48:54.030 --> 05:48:54.040 align:start position:0%
have just kind of come on board with it
 
05:48:56.230 --> 05:48:56.240 align:start position:0%
uh if the Board of Medicine is neutral
 
05:48:58.628 --> 05:48:58.638 align:start position:0%
on this they've looked at it they've
 
05:49:00.350 --> 05:49:00.360 align:start position:0%
considered it and they're now neutral on
 
05:49:02.430 --> 05:49:02.440 align:start position:0%
it as it stands they'd be in support of
 
05:49:04.430 --> 05:49:04.440 align:start position:0%
it um directly if we brought in this
 
05:49:06.310 --> 05:49:06.320 align:start position:0%
other Amendment but they're neutral on
 
05:49:07.948 --> 05:49:07.958 align:start position:0%
it now which means to me that they don't
 
05:49:11.070 --> 05:49:11.080 align:start position:0%
see any major concern of actual harm
 
05:49:12.948 --> 05:49:12.958 align:start position:0%
being done if we were to pass it this
 
05:49:16.150 --> 05:49:16.160 align:start position:0%
way um and I just feel like when you
 
05:49:18.548 --> 05:49:18.558 align:start position:0%
look at the requirements between nurse
 
05:49:21.110 --> 05:49:21.120 align:start position:0%
practitioners and physicians assistant
 
05:49:23.708 --> 05:49:23.718 align:start position:0%
which yes has the name assistant in it
 
05:49:26.270 --> 05:49:26.280 align:start position:0%
um but that may just have to do with the
 
05:49:28.030 --> 05:49:28.040 align:start position:0%
way that it developed over time more
 
05:49:30.190 --> 05:49:30.200 align:start position:0%
than how you know the the requirements
 
05:49:31.708 --> 05:49:31.718 align:start position:0%
now I'm sure that the requirements that
 
05:49:32.910 --> 05:49:32.920 align:start position:0%
they had to go through when it first
 
05:49:35.110 --> 05:49:35.120 align:start position:0%
came out aren't the same as they are now
 
05:49:36.110 --> 05:49:36.120 align:start position:0%
I'm sure we've increased those
 
05:49:39.590 --> 05:49:39.600 align:start position:0%
requirements over time um if nurse
 
05:49:41.110 --> 05:49:41.120 align:start position:0%
practitioners are allowed to practice
 
05:49:43.590 --> 05:49:43.600 align:start position:0%
independently straight out of school and
 
05:49:45.070 --> 05:49:45.080 align:start position:0%
Physicians assistants have to put in
 
05:49:47.350 --> 05:49:47.360 align:start position:0%
more hours than nurse practitioners do
 
05:49:49.750 --> 05:49:49.760 align:start position:0%
um before they can get their degree it
 
05:49:51.150 --> 05:49:51.160 align:start position:0%
just seems to me that we're not treating
 
05:49:53.310 --> 05:49:53.320 align:start position:0%
everybody equally these people are just
 
05:49:57.270 --> 05:49:57.280 align:start position:0%
as um qualified to to practice the
 
05:50:00.390 --> 05:50:00.400 align:start position:0%
medicine and their um particular realm
 
05:50:02.990 --> 05:50:03.000 align:start position:0%
of practice and I just don't think it's
 
05:50:04.830 --> 05:50:04.840 align:start position:0%
fair and and since at this point I don't
 
05:50:07.948 --> 05:50:07.958 align:start position:0%
know of anybody in the medical industry
 
05:50:10.150 --> 05:50:10.160 align:start position:0%
that is outright opposed to the bill as
 
05:50:11.468 --> 05:50:11.478 align:start position:0%
it stands with this amendment that we
 
05:50:14.190 --> 05:50:14.200 align:start position:0%
just passed um I don't see any reason
 
05:50:15.990 --> 05:50:16.000 align:start position:0%
why we would keep Physicians assistance
 
05:50:16.910 --> 05:50:16.920 align:start position:0%
from being able to practice
 
05:50:18.670 --> 05:50:18.680 align:start position:0%
independently in the
 
05:50:21.390 --> 05:50:21.400 align:start position:0%
state representative Gould thank you
 
05:50:25.190 --> 05:50:25.200 align:start position:0%
madam chair so I apologize for my what
 
05:50:27.230 --> 05:50:27.240 align:start position:0%
appeared to be waffling we did a great
 
05:50:29.990 --> 05:50:30.000 align:start position:0%
deal of Outreach and research and I
 
05:50:32.150 --> 05:50:32.160 align:start position:0%
think representative leus who chaired
 
05:50:34.430 --> 05:50:34.440 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee has represented it well
 
05:50:37.510 --> 05:50:37.520 align:start position:0%
but I'll just reinforce that it was very
 
05:50:41.750 --> 05:50:41.760 align:start position:0%
clearly laid out to us by the physicians
 
05:50:44.990 --> 05:50:45.000 align:start position:0%
assistant that their training differs
 
05:50:48.910 --> 05:50:48.920 align:start position:0%
slightly from uh nurse practitioners but
 
05:50:50.830 --> 05:50:50.840 align:start position:0%
at the end of seven years of training
 
05:50:53.628 --> 05:50:53.638 align:start position:0%
they are equivalent positions my
 
05:50:55.910 --> 05:50:55.920 align:start position:0%
daughter who's a nurse practitioner and
 
05:51:00.030 --> 05:51:00.040 align:start position:0%
who testifies before Congress and writes
 
05:51:03.030 --> 05:51:03.040 align:start position:0%
whatever she's way up there she clearly
 
05:51:05.628 --> 05:51:05.638 align:start position:0%
um stated uh if you talk to her or other
 
05:51:07.708 --> 05:51:07.718 align:start position:0%
nurse practitioners or the nursing board
 
05:51:09.590 --> 05:51:09.600 align:start position:0%
you'll probably hear how their training
 
05:51:11.590 --> 05:51:11.600 align:start position:0%
is superior to the physician assistant
 
05:51:13.430 --> 05:51:13.440 align:start position:0%
training but at the end of seven years
 
05:51:16.510 --> 05:51:16.520 align:start position:0%
they're equivalent and so bottom line is
 
05:51:18.708 --> 05:51:18.718 align:start position:0%
of course each profession feels theirs
 
05:51:21.670 --> 05:51:21.680 align:start position:0%
is the best but they both agree that at
 
05:51:23.708 --> 05:51:23.718 align:start position:0%
the end of 7 years they are equivalent
 
05:51:25.670 --> 05:51:25.680 align:start position:0%
and for the very reasons representative
 
05:51:28.548 --> 05:51:28.558 align:start position:0%
Simon has spoken I've felt very strongly
 
05:51:30.270 --> 05:51:30.280 align:start position:0%
that we shouldn't have a schizophrenic
 
05:51:32.310 --> 05:51:32.320 align:start position:0%
scenario in New Hampshire where we're
 
05:51:34.468 --> 05:51:34.478 align:start position:0%
allowing nurse practitioners to do what
 
05:51:38.350 --> 05:51:38.360 align:start position:0%
we don't allow their exact equivalent on
 
05:51:40.030 --> 05:51:40.040 align:start position:0%
the physician training side The
 
05:51:42.270 --> 05:51:42.280 align:start position:0%
Physician assistance to
 
05:51:44.948 --> 05:51:44.958 align:start position:0%
do however understanding that there was
 
05:51:47.468 --> 05:51:47.478 align:start position:0%
some reluctance I was willing to listen
 
05:51:52.070 --> 05:51:52.080 align:start position:0%
to or give a week's time to looking at
 
05:51:54.750 --> 05:51:54.760 align:start position:0%
um the possibility that we would need an
 
05:51:57.590 --> 05:51:57.600 align:start position:0%
amendment to get more support but after
 
05:51:59.708 --> 05:51:59.718 align:start position:0%
hearing all this testimony especially
 
05:52:03.830 --> 05:52:03.840 align:start position:0%
that the uh Physicians board you know
 
05:52:05.628 --> 05:52:05.638 align:start position:0%
the concerns regarding the Physicians
 
05:52:09.150 --> 05:52:09.160 align:start position:0%
board doesn't already have uh procedure
 
05:52:11.990 --> 05:52:12.000 align:start position:0%
set up I did get clarification that as
 
05:52:13.548 --> 05:52:13.558 align:start position:0%
we've talked about with all these
 
05:52:15.270 --> 05:52:15.280 align:start position:0%
different bills the changes that were
 
05:52:17.110 --> 05:52:17.120 align:start position:0%
done last year did not affect the
 
05:52:19.390 --> 05:52:19.400 align:start position:0%
Medical Board in the same way that it
 
05:52:20.948 --> 05:52:20.958 align:start position:0%
affected all the other boards so they're
 
05:52:23.590 --> 05:52:23.600 align:start position:0%
in a much better position to be able to
 
05:52:25.270 --> 05:52:25.280 align:start position:0%
have the time to write the scope of
 
05:52:27.230 --> 05:52:27.240 align:start position:0%
practice if they're saying they would
 
05:52:29.310 --> 05:52:29.320 align:start position:0%
support this bill as a it's written I
 
05:52:30.868 --> 05:52:30.878 align:start position:0%
think it's kind of a no-brainer we
 
05:52:33.430 --> 05:52:33.440 align:start position:0%
should support it they neutral neutral
 
05:52:36.150 --> 05:52:36.160 align:start position:0%
but they would not oppose it not oppos
 
05:52:39.190 --> 05:52:39.200 align:start position:0%
thank you is a step okay represent
 
05:52:40.590 --> 05:52:40.600 align:start position:0%
Schmidt did you were
 
05:52:44.628 --> 05:52:44.638 align:start position:0%
you so I I I'm fundamentally okay with
 
05:52:47.910 --> 05:52:47.920 align:start position:0%
the idea of the physician's assistance
 
05:52:51.030 --> 05:52:51.040 align:start position:0%
uh losing that tether that is holding
 
05:52:53.628 --> 05:52:53.638 align:start position:0%
them back in some respects uh with
 
05:52:56.430 --> 05:52:56.440 align:start position:0%
regard to not what they can do but how
 
05:53:00.030 --> 05:53:00.040 align:start position:0%
they can do it uh and it was emphasized
 
05:53:02.430 --> 05:53:02.440 align:start position:0%
and I sat in on the subcommittee and
 
05:53:06.628 --> 05:53:06.638 align:start position:0%
emphasized that basically both both both
 
05:53:08.788 --> 05:53:08.798 align:start position:0%
entities are
 
05:53:12.110 --> 05:53:12.120 align:start position:0%
doing Medical Care effectively and so
 
05:53:14.468 --> 05:53:14.478 align:start position:0%
forth and so on it's just the physicians
 
05:53:16.430 --> 05:53:16.440 align:start position:0%
assistant have to have somebody their
 
05:53:19.990 --> 05:53:20.000 align:start position:0%
tether to that signs off in a way but
 
05:53:23.510 --> 05:53:23.520 align:start position:0%
they the testimony was that they in many
 
05:53:25.150 --> 05:53:25.160 align:start position:0%
cases they don't have contact with that
 
05:53:27.230 --> 05:53:27.240 align:start position:0%
person they are not being supervised by
 
05:53:30.070 --> 05:53:30.080 align:start position:0%
that person uh and so forth so I'm
 
05:53:31.670 --> 05:53:31.680 align:start position:0%
sympathetic to the
 
05:53:35.510 --> 05:53:35.520 align:start position:0%
PA's you know cause here but it seems
 
05:53:37.830 --> 05:53:37.840 align:start position:0%
like there's a little bit of factual
 
05:53:40.590 --> 05:53:40.600 align:start position:0%
uncertainty about some aspects of this
 
05:53:43.110 --> 05:53:43.120 align:start position:0%
that would that would benefit since we
 
05:53:45.230 --> 05:53:45.240 align:start position:0%
have an executive session scheduled for
 
05:53:49.070 --> 05:53:49.080 align:start position:0%
next week and we can move this over to
 
05:53:52.110 --> 05:53:52.120 align:start position:0%
that point that that we at least
 
05:53:55.150 --> 05:53:55.160 align:start position:0%
consider investigating some of this
 
05:53:59.350 --> 05:53:59.360 align:start position:0%
unclarity so that we operating all on
 
05:54:00.948 --> 05:54:00.958 align:start position:0%
the same page that's
 
05:54:03.510 --> 05:54:03.520 align:start position:0%
all represent
 
05:54:07.270 --> 05:54:07.280 align:start position:0%
Goldie thank you madam chair and in
 
05:54:09.510 --> 05:54:09.520 align:start position:0%
difference to my colleague I I do want
 
05:54:13.030 --> 05:54:13.040 align:start position:0%
to say there are not exactly the same
 
05:54:15.110 --> 05:54:15.120 align:start position:0%
nurse practitioner or physician
 
05:54:16.868 --> 05:54:16.878 align:start position:0%
assistants they're not equival they're
 
05:54:20.110 --> 05:54:20.120 align:start position:0%
not exactly equivalent that is a not
 
05:54:22.030 --> 05:54:22.040 align:start position:0%
correct statement I just want to go on
 
05:54:24.230 --> 05:54:24.240 align:start position:0%
record stating that that there are two
 
05:54:25.830 --> 05:54:25.840 align:start position:0%
different practices a physician
 
05:54:28.750 --> 05:54:28.760 align:start position:0%
assistants ner prer are not exactly
 
05:54:33.190 --> 05:54:33.200 align:start position:0%
equal and I will state that I will not
 
05:54:36.430 --> 05:54:36.440 align:start position:0%
support this um listening to this
 
05:54:38.390 --> 05:54:38.400 align:start position:0%
discussion around the table that this
 
05:54:42.430 --> 05:54:42.440 align:start position:0%
bill could be made better with an
 
05:54:44.830 --> 05:54:44.840 align:start position:0%
amendment I think
 
05:54:47.910 --> 05:54:47.920 align:start position:0%
we owe that for this committee to if we
 
05:54:50.670 --> 05:54:50.680 align:start position:0%
can make a bill better to do
 
05:54:52.948 --> 05:54:52.958 align:start position:0%
that I think we all take pride in the
 
05:54:54.110 --> 05:54:54.120 align:start position:0%
work we do
 
05:54:58.270 --> 05:54:58.280 align:start position:0%
here and I would hope going forward we
 
05:54:59.830 --> 05:54:59.840 align:start position:0%
could do that I mean we've done it with
 
05:55:01.868 --> 05:55:01.878 align:start position:0%
a previous Bill we're working on 112
 
05:55:05.150 --> 05:55:05.160 align:start position:0%
pages that we said we can make
 
05:55:07.510 --> 05:55:07.520 align:start position:0%
better this is a short piece of work and
 
05:55:09.150 --> 05:55:09.160 align:start position:0%
if we're going to do it let's make it
 
05:55:14.150 --> 05:55:14.160 align:start position:0%
better um okay representative continue
 
05:55:15.548 --> 05:55:15.558 align:start position:0%
represent I I
 
05:55:20.350 --> 05:55:20.360 align:start position:0%
was contacted by some individuals up in
 
05:55:22.670 --> 05:55:22.680 align:start position:0%
Littleton who this would
 
05:55:22.680 --> 05:55:25.030 align:start position:0%
Littleton who this would
affect

05:55:25.030 --> 05:55:25.040 align:start position:0%
affect
 
05:55:27.830 --> 05:55:27.840 align:start position:0%
and and the the email that they sent
 
05:55:29.670 --> 05:55:29.680 align:start position:0%
it's seemed like the intent was so that
 
05:55:31.230 --> 05:55:31.240 align:start position:0%
they could have their private practice
 
05:55:33.270 --> 05:55:33.280 align:start position:0%
without having the
 
05:55:37.110 --> 05:55:37.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:40.430 --> 05:55:40.440 align:start position:0%
physician and if that was the reason
 
05:55:42.590 --> 05:55:42.600 align:start position:0%
this bill was put in and then all of a
 
05:55:45.150 --> 05:55:45.160 align:start position:0%
sudden got the train rolling for
 
05:55:47.910 --> 05:55:47.920 align:start position:0%
everybody else to jump on board you know
 
05:55:50.670 --> 05:55:50.680 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure that's the reason we should
 
05:55:53.750 --> 05:55:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:56.628 --> 05:55:56.638 align:start position:0%
this there's a lot of other aspects to
 
05:55:58.510 --> 05:55:58.520 align:start position:0%
this we need to look at the surrounding
 
05:55:59.948 --> 05:55:59.958 align:start position:0%
states are we've heard from
 
05:56:01.750 --> 05:56:01.760 align:start position:0%
representative groa about Maine and the
 
05:56:03.750 --> 05:56:03.760 align:start position:0%
testimony that well Maine has done it
 
05:56:05.708 --> 05:56:05.718 align:start position:0%
well they
 
05:56:05.718 --> 05:56:07.510 align:start position:0%
well they
haven't

05:56:07.510 --> 05:56:07.520 align:start position:0%
haven't
 
05:56:10.030 --> 05:56:10.040 align:start position:0%
so let's get the facts straight before
 
05:56:12.350 --> 05:56:12.360 align:start position:0%
we pass
 
05:56:15.230 --> 05:56:15.240 align:start position:0%
something thank you represent Brown did
 
05:56:17.590 --> 05:56:17.600 align:start position:0%
you have a comment uh thank you madam
 
05:56:20.590 --> 05:56:20.600 align:start position:0%
chair um so I'll apologize to my
 
05:56:22.468 --> 05:56:22.478 align:start position:0%
subcommittee members for apparently
 
05:56:25.910 --> 05:56:25.920 align:start position:0%
having changed my mind uh up
 
05:56:28.990 --> 05:56:29.000 align:start position:0%
front uh to to representative goalie's
 
05:56:31.548 --> 05:56:31.558 align:start position:0%
comment uh the New Hampshire Society of
 
05:56:33.868 --> 05:56:33.878 align:start position:0%
Physicians assistants gave us this
 
05:56:35.628 --> 05:56:35.638 align:start position:0%
document that says differences between
 
05:56:38.910 --> 05:56:38.920 align:start position:0%
Pas and NPS NPS follow a patient
 
05:56:40.468 --> 05:56:40.478 align:start position:0%
centered model in which they focus on
 
05:56:42.990 --> 05:56:43.000 align:start position:0%
disease prevention and health education
 
05:56:44.868 --> 05:56:44.878 align:start position:0%
as well as handling assessment diagnosis
 
05:56:47.230 --> 05:56:47.240 align:start position:0%
and treatment Pas follow a disease
 
05:56:49.670 --> 05:56:49.680 align:start position:0%
centered model like physicians in which
 
05:56:51.110 --> 05:56:51.120 align:start position:0%
they focus on the biologic and
 
05:56:54.670 --> 05:56:54.680 align:start position:0%
pathologic components of Health etc etc
 
05:56:58.030 --> 05:56:58.040 align:start position:0%
so they aren't the same so yes the and
 
05:57:01.030 --> 05:57:01.040 align:start position:0%
in in their uh comparison of the
 
05:57:03.110 --> 05:57:03.120 align:start position:0%
training there is more training for
 
05:57:04.910 --> 05:57:04.920 align:start position:0%
physicians assistant which makes sense
 
05:57:07.628 --> 05:57:07.638 align:start position:0%
based on what they tell you that they
 
05:57:10.230 --> 05:57:10.240 align:start position:0%
that their the task is uh I'm I'm not
 
05:57:12.510 --> 05:57:12.520 align:start position:0%
going to vote for this and maybe I'm the
 
05:57:15.590 --> 05:57:15.600 align:start position:0%
only person in the room that thought if
 
05:57:17.230 --> 05:57:17.240 align:start position:0%
I had a physician's assistant that there
 
05:57:19.510 --> 05:57:19.520 align:start position:0%
was a doctor in the building for them to
 
05:57:21.990 --> 05:57:22.000 align:start position:0%
talk to apparently I've been wrong about
 
05:57:24.868 --> 05:57:24.878 align:start position:0%
that in my entire life um that's a
 
05:57:26.990 --> 05:57:27.000 align:start position:0%
different conversation but that's as far
 
05:57:29.590 --> 05:57:29.600 align:start position:0%
as I'm concerned that's not right you
 
05:57:32.750 --> 05:57:32.760 align:start position:0%
can't how do we untether the person from
 
05:57:34.868 --> 05:57:34.878 align:start position:0%
the the the the doctor and then still
 
05:57:37.310 --> 05:57:37.320 align:start position:0%
call him a physician's assistant
 
05:57:39.510 --> 05:57:39.520 align:start position:0%
accepting what representative Simon said
 
05:57:41.750 --> 05:57:41.760 align:start position:0%
about maybe the history of that so I
 
05:57:43.190 --> 05:57:43.200 align:start position:0%
can't vote for
 
05:57:46.190 --> 05:57:46.200 align:start position:0%
this yes I representative Lane hasn't
 
05:57:46.200 --> 05:57:47.948 align:start position:0%
this yes I representative Lane hasn't
spoken

05:57:47.948 --> 05:57:47.958 align:start position:0%
spoken
 
05:57:51.548 --> 05:57:51.558 align:start position:0%
yet I know I'm only a sub but listening
 
05:57:54.030 --> 05:57:54.040 align:start position:0%
to this and I did watch the testimony on
 
05:57:56.548 --> 05:57:56.558 align:start position:0%
this bill not the subcommittee but the
 
05:57:58.548 --> 05:57:58.558 align:start position:0%
first public hearing
 
05:58:02.110 --> 05:58:02.120 align:start position:0%
my question in listening to what repres
 
05:58:04.510 --> 05:58:04.520 align:start position:0%
representative Simon and representative
 
05:58:10.628 --> 05:58:10.638 align:start position:0%
goul have said is does it give them
 
05:58:12.948 --> 05:58:12.958 align:start position:0%
seven years so they have to go that
 
05:58:15.750 --> 05:58:15.760 align:start position:0%
seven years and then they're free from
 
05:58:18.708 --> 05:58:18.718 align:start position:0%
this supervision or collaboration and I
 
05:58:20.910 --> 05:58:20.920 align:start position:0%
think you know just to give you an
 
05:58:23.708 --> 05:58:23.718 align:start position:0%
Outsiders perspective on what I've been
 
05:58:26.750 --> 05:58:26.760 align:start position:0%
listening to um it's not really a
 
05:58:28.670 --> 05:58:28.680 align:start position:0%
question it's just I I think that should
 
05:58:32.030 --> 05:58:32.040 align:start position:0%
be made perhaps more clear in the bill
 
05:58:35.468 --> 05:58:35.478 align:start position:0%
because at least the way I read it it
 
05:58:37.750 --> 05:58:37.760 align:start position:0%
that's not clear so thank you
 
05:58:40.190 --> 05:58:40.200 align:start position:0%
representative gold thank you madam
 
05:58:42.150 --> 05:58:42.160 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for that question first
 
05:58:45.270 --> 05:58:45.280 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to address that um
 
05:58:48.270 --> 05:58:48.280 align:start position:0%
equivalent and equal are two different
 
05:58:50.110 --> 05:58:50.120 align:start position:0%
statements so I wanted to be very very
 
05:58:52.510 --> 05:58:52.520 align:start position:0%
clear I was not ever insinuating that
 
05:58:56.030 --> 05:58:56.040 align:start position:0%
they were equal they're equivalent in
 
05:58:59.628 --> 05:58:59.638 align:start position:0%
that it gets d DET but nurses follow a a
 
05:59:01.788 --> 05:59:01.798 align:start position:0%
four-year training program that has a
 
05:59:03.628 --> 05:59:03.638 align:start position:0%
lot of clinical hours involved and a lot
 
05:59:06.990 --> 05:59:07.000 align:start position:0%
of patient uh direct patient work
 
05:59:09.628 --> 05:59:09.638 align:start position:0%
whereas physic and then they they get
 
05:59:12.230 --> 05:59:12.240 align:start position:0%
their NP work most of them nowadays
 
05:59:15.030 --> 05:59:15.040 align:start position:0%
online and it does not have as many of
 
05:59:17.548 --> 05:59:17.558 align:start position:0%
the clinical hours involved the Su you
 
05:59:20.548 --> 05:59:20.558 align:start position:0%
know the patient one to one I call it a
 
05:59:22.030 --> 05:59:22.040 align:start position:0%
practicum because I'm a social worker
 
05:59:24.070 --> 05:59:24.080 align:start position:0%
but I know there's a medical term for it
 
05:59:27.350 --> 05:59:27.360 align:start position:0%
in the medical field whereas a PA can
 
05:59:30.590 --> 05:59:30.600 align:start position:0%
have a very different first four years
 
05:59:34.310 --> 05:59:34.320 align:start position:0%
of education but then their extra um
 
05:59:37.750 --> 05:59:37.760 align:start position:0%
their elevated degree is where they get
 
05:59:40.628 --> 05:59:40.638 align:start position:0%
the bulk of all their hours of work with
 
05:59:43.590 --> 05:59:43.600 align:start position:0%
the the patients so much like a doctor
 
05:59:45.230 --> 05:59:45.240 align:start position:0%
where they're doing their rounds and
 
05:59:46.390 --> 05:59:46.400 align:start position:0%
what have you under a doctor's
 
05:59:48.270 --> 05:59:48.280 align:start position:0%
supervision so that's where the
 
05:59:50.270 --> 05:59:50.280 align:start position:0%
equivalent comes out and that's the
 
05:59:53.190 --> 05:59:53.200 align:start position:0%
seven years it's 7 years of training so
 
05:59:55.270 --> 05:59:55.280 align:start position:0%
nurses have seven years of training
 
05:59:58.590 --> 05:59:58.600 align:start position:0%
that's different than a p
 
06:00:00.468 --> 06:00:00.478 align:start position:0%
Pas have seven years of training that
 
06:00:03.310 --> 06:00:03.320 align:start position:0%
are different than a nurse practitioner
 
06:00:04.868 --> 06:00:04.878 align:start position:0%
at the end of the seven years of
 
06:00:07.430 --> 06:00:07.440 align:start position:0%
training they are equivalent in terms of
 
06:00:09.830 --> 06:00:09.840 align:start position:0%
their skills and their ability to go out
 
06:00:12.708 --> 06:00:12.718 align:start position:0%
and work with patients so I I hope that
 
06:00:15.868 --> 06:00:15.878 align:start position:0%
clarifies what the testimony we heard
 
06:00:20.110 --> 06:00:20.120 align:start position:0%
was um Massachusetts also I would add is
 
06:00:22.868 --> 06:00:22.878 align:start position:0%
has a bill that they're looking to do
 
06:00:24.350 --> 06:00:24.360 align:start position:0%
and in the
 
06:00:28.270 --> 06:00:28.280 align:start position:0%
talks I had with my daughter and with
 
06:00:31.110 --> 06:00:31.120 align:start position:0%
the PA assistance and then this morning
 
06:00:33.750 --> 06:00:33.760 align:start position:0%
what I heard had come from the medical
 
06:00:37.070 --> 06:00:37.080 align:start position:0%
board and what the pa um professional
 
06:00:39.708 --> 06:00:39.718 align:start position:0%
association was advocating is that we
 
06:00:42.190 --> 06:00:42.200 align:start position:0%
look at what Massachusetts bill is and
 
06:00:44.468 --> 06:00:44.478 align:start position:0%
that that's a very good model it will
 
06:00:49.510 --> 06:00:49.520 align:start position:0%
still make our Pas out of um not have
 
06:00:51.350 --> 06:00:51.360 align:start position:0%
equal ground with our nurse
 
06:00:53.670 --> 06:00:53.680 align:start position:0%
practitioners if we follow a different
 
06:00:55.590 --> 06:00:55.600 align:start position:0%
model we'll still have a
 
06:00:57.948 --> 06:00:57.958 align:start position:0%
schizophrenic system in New hampsh where
 
06:01:00.030 --> 06:01:00.040 align:start position:0%
we're treating two equivalent positions
 
06:01:02.548 --> 06:01:02.558 align:start position:0%
differently but if this committee's
 
06:01:04.868 --> 06:01:04.878 align:start position:0%
happier with that I'd be willing to take
 
06:01:06.830 --> 06:01:06.840 align:start position:0%
the lead on looking at the Massachusetts
 
06:01:08.430 --> 06:01:08.440 align:start position:0%
piece and looking at the possibility of
 
06:01:10.548 --> 06:01:10.558 align:start position:0%
an amendment for next
 
06:01:14.190 --> 06:01:14.200 align:start position:0%
week excellent because representative
 
06:01:16.150 --> 06:01:16.160 align:start position:0%
groa and representative leus have
 
06:01:19.590 --> 06:01:19.600 align:start position:0%
already signed up to look at House Bill
 
06:01:23.910 --> 06:01:23.920 align:start position:0%
1271 versus House Bill 1095
 
06:01:27.110 --> 06:01:27.120 align:start position:0%
and I personally wouldn't want them to
 
06:01:29.990 --> 06:01:30.000 align:start position:0%
to add any additional work on their
 
06:01:32.948 --> 06:01:32.958 align:start position:0%
their effort representative Gould
 
06:01:38.350 --> 06:01:38.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:41.628 --> 06:01:41.638 align:start position:0%
and I'll help I'll help representative G
 
06:01:44.110 --> 06:01:44.120 align:start position:0%
you are busy I know but this is near and
 
06:01:46.750 --> 06:01:46.760 align:start position:0%
dear to my heart as you know and I'm
 
06:01:48.548 --> 06:01:48.558 align:start position:0%
sure representative leus
 
06:01:50.910 --> 06:01:50.920 align:start position:0%
won although representative leus has
 
06:01:53.110 --> 06:01:53.120 align:start position:0%
been patiently holding his hand up so I
 
06:01:54.868 --> 06:01:54.878 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I interrupted I jumped right
 
06:01:57.868 --> 06:01:57.878 align:start position:0%
in excuse me well I haven't been right
 
06:02:00.628 --> 06:02:00.638 align:start position:0%
yet so yes representative leus I'm all
 
06:02:03.788 --> 06:02:03.798 align:start position:0%
right um try to clear the chat thank you
 
06:02:06.868 --> 06:02:06.878 align:start position:0%
I mean I understand the concerns
 
06:02:09.430 --> 06:02:09.440 align:start position:0%
um we but we heard testimony there is
 
06:02:10.990 --> 06:02:11.000 align:start position:0%
the problem with collaboration
 
06:02:12.230 --> 06:02:12.240 align:start position:0%
agreements the other thing we heard is
 
06:02:14.510 --> 06:02:14.520 align:start position:0%
that although the law says that the phys
 
06:02:16.628 --> 06:02:16.638 align:start position:0%
who signs a collaboration agreement has
 
06:02:18.350 --> 06:02:18.360 align:start position:0%
no legal liability the insurance
 
06:02:21.110 --> 06:02:21.120 align:start position:0%
companies don't believe that and as part
 
06:02:22.750 --> 06:02:22.760 align:start position:0%
of signing a collaboration agreement
 
06:02:25.510 --> 06:02:25.520 align:start position:0%
that Physicians are requiring the PAs to
 
06:02:27.190 --> 06:02:27.200 align:start position:0%
have their insurance carry them as a
 
06:02:30.510 --> 06:02:30.520 align:start position:0%
right wrer um because I I guess I don't
 
06:02:32.030 --> 06:02:32.040 align:start position:0%
know the issue is they can still be sued
 
06:02:34.788 --> 06:02:34.798 align:start position:0%
regardless of what we say
 
06:02:40.750 --> 06:02:40.760 align:start position:0%
um and deeper Pockets yeah um probably
 
06:02:46.190 --> 06:02:46.200 align:start position:0%
the case and um and I don't see um
 
06:02:48.030 --> 06:02:48.040 align:start position:0%
requiring a collaboration agreement even
 
06:02:49.468 --> 06:02:49.478 align:start position:0%
for limited time as actually an
 
06:02:51.868 --> 06:02:51.878 align:start position:0%
improvement on this bill I disagree with
 
06:02:54.430 --> 06:02:54.440 align:start position:0%
that um it's clear that a lot of Pas
 
06:02:55.948 --> 06:02:55.958 align:start position:0%
have been practicing under a
 
06:02:59.270 --> 06:02:59.280 align:start position:0%
collaboration agreement that is really
 
06:03:02.110 --> 06:03:02.120 align:start position:0%
not doing much of anything and we
 
06:03:03.708 --> 06:03:03.718 align:start position:0%
haven't seen any serious problems with
 
06:03:06.230 --> 06:03:06.240 align:start position:0%
it and I mean the reason for including
 
06:03:08.670 --> 06:03:08.680 align:start position:0%
that I would think a valid reason is
 
06:03:11.270 --> 06:03:11.280 align:start position:0%
because um you know it is a threat to
 
06:03:12.350 --> 06:03:12.360 align:start position:0%
public health and safety and there
 
06:03:14.590 --> 06:03:14.600 align:start position:0%
hasn't been any evidence I've seen or we
 
06:03:17.750 --> 06:03:17.760 align:start position:0%
heard that that's the case so I mean at
 
06:03:19.708 --> 06:03:19.718 align:start position:0%
this point I'd like to proceed with the
 
06:03:23.270 --> 06:03:23.280 align:start position:0%
uh otpa uh motion representative Simon
 
06:03:25.548 --> 06:03:25.558 align:start position:0%
of the manery thank you madam chair I
 
06:03:26.948 --> 06:03:26.958 align:start position:0%
just uh wanted to have the opportunity
 
06:03:29.030 --> 06:03:29.040 align:start position:0%
to address representative goal's concern
 
06:03:30.590 --> 06:03:30.600 align:start position:0%
um out of Littleton because I'm familiar
 
06:03:33.390 --> 06:03:33.400 align:start position:0%
with it um that's a situation where the
 
06:03:35.190 --> 06:03:35.200 align:start position:0%
physician's assistant had been
 
06:03:39.110 --> 06:03:39.120 align:start position:0%
practicing for several several decades
 
06:03:42.868 --> 06:03:42.878 align:start position:0%
um and really without any in reality
 
06:03:44.868 --> 06:03:44.878 align:start position:0%
supervision although the doctor that she
 
06:03:47.430 --> 06:03:47.440 align:start position:0%
was in collaboration with you know still
 
06:03:48.948 --> 06:03:48.958 align:start position:0%
had signatory
 
06:03:50.830 --> 06:03:50.840 align:start position:0%
responsibilities um that doctor is
 
06:03:54.350 --> 06:03:54.360 align:start position:0%
retiring and once again this nurse this
 
06:03:55.628 --> 06:03:55.638 align:start position:0%
um physician's assistant has been
 
06:03:57.708 --> 06:03:57.718 align:start position:0%
practicing for like 30 years
 
06:04:00.670 --> 06:04:00.680 align:start position:0%
um and the idea that a nurse
 
06:04:02.990 --> 06:04:03.000 align:start position:0%
practitioner could have been practicing
 
06:04:05.190 --> 06:04:05.200 align:start position:0%
on their own for the last 30 years and
 
06:04:06.628 --> 06:04:06.638 align:start position:0%
she was going to have to go out and find
 
06:04:08.150 --> 06:04:08.160 align:start position:0%
a new doctor to have a collaboration
 
06:04:10.390 --> 06:04:10.400 align:start position:0%
agreement uh seemed unreasonable and I
 
06:04:11.910 --> 06:04:11.920 align:start position:0%
would agree with her it seems very
 
06:04:14.310 --> 06:04:14.320 align:start position:0%
unreasonable um and so I think it was a
 
06:04:16.590 --> 06:04:16.600 align:start position:0%
legitimate reason to bring legislation
 
06:04:18.750 --> 06:04:18.760 align:start position:0%
before the body I mean I think that's a
 
06:04:20.948 --> 06:04:20.958 align:start position:0%
that's a discrepancy that's worth our
 
06:04:22.868 --> 06:04:22.878 align:start position:0%
attention at the very least um and our
 
06:04:24.788 --> 06:04:24.798 align:start position:0%
discussion at the very least and so I
 
06:04:26.948 --> 06:04:26.958 align:start position:0%
think it was reasonable um and my point
 
06:04:28.868 --> 06:04:28.878 align:start position:0%
just being just because that was its
 
06:04:31.070 --> 06:04:31.080 align:start position:0%
start uh the way that it has developed
 
06:04:32.190 --> 06:04:32.200 align:start position:0%
and the way the conversation has
 
06:04:36.110 --> 06:04:36.120 align:start position:0%
developed since that time um has led to
 
06:04:39.830 --> 06:04:39.840 align:start position:0%
once again the Physicians um assistant
 
06:04:42.510 --> 06:04:42.520 align:start position:0%
um Advocates coming out and and being in
 
06:04:44.150 --> 06:04:44.160 align:start position:0%
support of the bill liking the bill the
 
06:04:46.150 --> 06:04:46.160 align:start position:0%
medical uh board saying that they're
 
06:04:48.868 --> 06:04:48.878 align:start position:0%
neutral on the bill the um Medical
 
06:04:50.750 --> 06:04:50.760 align:start position:0%
Association not being able to provide
 
06:04:52.350 --> 06:04:52.360 align:start position:0%
any data that would indicate that either
 
06:04:54.230 --> 06:04:54.240 align:start position:0%
nurse practitioners have caused any real
 
06:04:56.708 --> 06:04:56.718 align:start position:0%
serious harm uh practicing on their own
 
06:04:58.750 --> 06:04:58.760 align:start position:0%
or that the states that have are already
 
06:05:00.350 --> 06:05:00.360 align:start position:0%
adopted and there are some outside of
 
06:05:02.548 --> 06:05:02.558 align:start position:0%
the state of Maine um Utah I believe was
 
06:05:03.830 --> 06:05:03.840 align:start position:0%
one of them I can't remember all of them
 
06:05:06.030 --> 06:05:06.040 align:start position:0%
off the top of my head um Wyoming
 
06:05:07.628 --> 06:05:07.638 align:start position:0%
they've been they've been practicing for
 
06:05:10.548 --> 06:05:10.558 align:start position:0%
a number of years without any incident
 
06:05:12.110 --> 06:05:12.120 align:start position:0%
uh increased negative outcomes for
 
06:05:13.990 --> 06:05:14.000 align:start position:0%
patients uh I just think that when you
 
06:05:15.788 --> 06:05:15.798 align:start position:0%
take all of that stuff into
 
06:05:15.798 --> 06:05:17.548 align:start position:0%
take all of that stuff into
consideration

06:05:17.548 --> 06:05:17.558 align:start position:0%
consideration
 
06:05:19.910 --> 06:05:19.920 align:start position:0%
um I just I I don't want to become
 
06:05:22.510 --> 06:05:22.520 align:start position:0%
biased by the fact that
 
06:05:25.788 --> 06:05:25.798 align:start position:0%
historically we have handled this
 
06:05:27.590 --> 06:05:27.600 align:start position:0%
particular profession and a particular
 
06:05:30.110 --> 06:05:30.120 align:start position:0%
way um and that that somehow
 
06:05:32.190 --> 06:05:32.200 align:start position:0%
necessitates the idea that you know
 
06:05:35.788 --> 06:05:35.798 align:start position:0%
that's necessary or or helpful even um I
 
06:05:37.310 --> 06:05:37.320 align:start position:0%
don't think that I think what's being
 
06:05:39.628 --> 06:05:39.638 align:start position:0%
proven over time as this has gone on and
 
06:05:41.430 --> 06:05:41.440 align:start position:0%
these agreements have become somebody
 
06:05:43.030 --> 06:05:43.040 align:start position:0%
signing something in Pennsylvania for
 
06:05:44.150 --> 06:05:44.160 align:start position:0%
somebody who's practicing in New
 
06:05:46.150 --> 06:05:46.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um things of that nature which
 
06:05:49.070 --> 06:05:49.080 align:start position:0%
we had testimony is a reality um that we
 
06:05:51.510 --> 06:05:51.520 align:start position:0%
have left we have left whatever it was
 
06:05:53.430 --> 06:05:53.440 align:start position:0%
at the beginning we've left that as the
 
06:05:55.868 --> 06:05:55.878 align:start position:0%
way of practicing medicine we're really
 
06:05:57.628 --> 06:05:57.638 align:start position:0%
practicing almost independ ly at this
 
06:06:00.868 --> 06:06:00.878 align:start position:0%
point anyway um without any harm to the
 
06:06:02.350 --> 06:06:02.360 align:start position:0%
public that we know of that can be
 
06:06:03.468 --> 06:06:03.478 align:start position:0%
measured in any way that could be
 
06:06:05.510 --> 06:06:05.520 align:start position:0%
testified to in any way and so I just
 
06:06:06.590 --> 06:06:06.600 align:start position:0%
think that we should be treating them
 
06:06:08.548 --> 06:06:08.558 align:start position:0%
the same as as representative gold said
 
06:06:11.070 --> 06:06:11.080 align:start position:0%
as nurse practitioners who have an
 
06:06:13.468 --> 06:06:13.478 align:start position:0%
equivalent um
 
06:06:17.070 --> 06:06:17.080 align:start position:0%
degree represent beart thank you madam
 
06:06:19.510 --> 06:06:19.520 align:start position:0%
chair I think the bigger issue is how
 
06:06:21.310 --> 06:06:21.320 align:start position:0%
can we lower the cost of health care for
 
06:06:23.190 --> 06:06:23.200 align:start position:0%
the most amount of people in the state
 
06:06:25.190 --> 06:06:25.200 align:start position:0%
and I I think having more people
 
06:06:26.788 --> 06:06:26.798 align:start position:0%
practicing at a higher level would be
 
06:06:28.830 --> 06:06:28.840 align:start position:0%
Ben beneficial with social media the way
 
06:06:30.430 --> 06:06:30.440 align:start position:0%
it is if you know a doctor is hurting
 
06:06:31.708 --> 06:06:31.718 align:start position:0%
people you're going to find out about it
 
06:06:34.510 --> 06:06:34.520 align:start position:0%
pretty fast and buyer beare beware at a
 
06:06:38.270 --> 06:06:38.280 align:start position:0%
certain point the the um second element
 
06:06:39.868 --> 06:06:39.878 align:start position:0%
which I totally slipped my mind at the
 
06:06:44.670 --> 06:06:44.680 align:start position:0%
time is um I'll end that that all
 
06:06:48.788 --> 06:06:48.798 align:start position:0%
right thank you rip you get to
 
06:06:51.628 --> 06:06:51.638 align:start position:0%
be yes represent I remember it came to
 
06:06:54.590 --> 06:06:54.600 align:start position:0%
me um New Hampshire in multiple listings
 
06:06:56.150 --> 06:06:56.160 align:start position:0%
has been listed as the free estate
 
06:06:58.548 --> 06:06:58.558 align:start position:0%
economic reasons social reasons so I
 
06:07:01.270 --> 06:07:01.280 align:start position:0%
think looking to Massachusetts for any
 
06:07:03.830 --> 06:07:03.840 align:start position:0%
guidance in any regard would be a a bad
 
06:07:05.070 --> 06:07:05.080 align:start position:0%
choice I'm just going to put that up
 
06:07:08.868 --> 06:07:08.878 align:start position:0%
there thank you thank you represent Mani
 
06:07:12.230 --> 06:07:12.240 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair if I can um focus
 
06:07:14.750 --> 06:07:14.760 align:start position:0%
a little bit on number of Pas in New
 
06:07:17.788 --> 06:07:17.798 align:start position:0%
Hampshire versus number of Pas in the US
 
06:07:17.798 --> 06:07:19.270 align:start position:0%
Hampshire versus number of Pas in the US
800

06:07:19.270 --> 06:07:19.280 align:start position:0%
800
 
06:07:19.280 --> 06:07:21.390 align:start position:0%
800
plus

06:07:21.390 --> 06:07:21.400 align:start position:0%
plus
 
06:07:24.910 --> 06:07:24.920 align:start position:0%
140,000 uh plus Pas in the US percentage
 
06:07:27.070 --> 06:07:27.080 align:start position:0%
of Pas by specialty in New Hampshire
 
06:07:32.030 --> 06:07:32.040 align:start position:0%
sure is 37% are Surgical subsp Specialty
 
06:07:36.868 --> 06:07:36.878 align:start position:0%
15% all other Specialties 15% Internal
 
06:07:40.110 --> 06:07:40.120 align:start position:0%
Medicine General Pediatrics or General
 
06:07:42.788 --> 06:07:42.798 align:start position:0%
Internal Medicine is
 
06:07:45.948 --> 06:07:45.958 align:start position:0%
1.2% or emergency medicine if you think
 
06:07:48.788 --> 06:07:48.798 align:start position:0%
about all the emergency medicine Urgent
 
06:07:52.270 --> 06:07:52.280 align:start position:0%
Care Family Medicine Internal Medicine
 
06:07:54.830 --> 06:07:54.840 align:start position:0%
uh and all other specialty in surgical
 
06:07:57.708 --> 06:07:57.718 align:start position:0%
they're practicing together as a team in
 
06:08:01.230 --> 06:08:01.240 align:start position:0%
a uh healthc care setting so this uh
 
06:08:03.868 --> 06:08:03.878 align:start position:0%
collaboration thing is automatic in
 
06:08:07.390 --> 06:08:07.400 align:start position:0%
terms of the uh organization providing
 
06:08:10.628 --> 06:08:10.638 align:start position:0%
per percentage of Pas by settings in New
 
06:08:10.638 --> 06:08:12.190 align:start position:0%
per percentage of Pas by settings in New
Hampshire

06:08:12.190 --> 06:08:12.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
06:08:15.390 --> 06:08:15.400 align:start position:0%
43.9% hospital setting
 
06:08:19.150 --> 06:08:19.160 align:start position:0%
42.7% physicians's office or clinic 11%
 
06:08:23.230 --> 06:08:23.240 align:start position:0%
Urgent Care 2.4% other settings private
 
06:08:26.868 --> 06:08:26.878 align:start position:0%
practice so this is a small amount if if
 
06:08:29.468 --> 06:08:29.478 align:start position:0%
you're going to
 
06:08:32.750 --> 06:08:32.760 align:start position:0%
untether you're catering to
 
06:08:37.788 --> 06:08:37.798 align:start position:0%
1.2% in uh specialty areas and
 
06:08:42.350 --> 06:08:42.360 align:start position:0%
2.4% that would jeopardize or upset the
 
06:08:46.430 --> 06:08:46.440 align:start position:0%
apple card um in other settings that is
 
06:08:48.990 --> 06:08:49.000 align:start position:0%
working well in terms of urgent care or
 
06:08:52.468 --> 06:08:52.478 align:start position:0%
Physician's office or hospital setting
 
06:08:57.270 --> 06:08:57.280 align:start position:0%
that is providing quality care so the
 
06:09:00.548 --> 06:09:00.558 align:start position:0%
last um
 
06:09:03.830 --> 06:09:03.840 align:start position:0%
34% of Pas are employed by physician
 
06:09:06.990 --> 06:09:07.000 align:start position:0%
groups are Solo practices so they're
 
06:09:09.990 --> 06:09:10.000 align:start position:0%
already working together with Physicians
 
06:09:14.510 --> 06:09:14.520 align:start position:0%
and in New Hampshire 42.4% of Pas serve
 
06:09:17.190 --> 06:09:17.200 align:start position:0%
in the rural areas a typical PA
 
06:09:21.070 --> 06:09:21.080 align:start position:0%
completes 56 patient visits per week
 
06:09:24.350 --> 06:09:24.360 align:start position:0%
with the supervision this is as a team
 
06:09:28.750 --> 06:09:28.760 align:start position:0%
so this already is working so if you not
 
06:09:31.230 --> 06:09:31.240 align:start position:0%
upset the apple cart and say okay
 
06:09:33.548 --> 06:09:33.558 align:start position:0%
everybody can go do independent we're
 
06:09:37.070 --> 06:09:37.080 align:start position:0%
taking that safety net away so this is
 
06:09:39.628 --> 06:09:39.638 align:start position:0%
just the statistics that I have I just
 
06:09:42.670 --> 06:09:42.680 align:start position:0%
wanted to share it thank you represent
 
06:09:45.750 --> 06:09:45.760 align:start position:0%
leus thank you I would uh maybe have a
 
06:09:48.390 --> 06:09:48.400 align:start position:0%
different interpretation of that data um
 
06:09:50.948 --> 06:09:50.958 align:start position:0%
I don't see any apple cart will be up
 
06:09:52.548 --> 06:09:52.558 align:start position:0%
Turn on I mean if they're already
 
06:09:54.468 --> 06:09:54.478 align:start position:0%
working with a Physician Group which
 
06:09:56.390 --> 06:09:56.400 align:start position:0%
most of them are or a physician or a
 
06:09:59.548 --> 06:09:59.558 align:start position:0%
hospital hospital um then not requiring
 
06:10:01.310 --> 06:10:01.320 align:start position:0%
a written collaboration agreement is not
 
06:10:02.948 --> 06:10:02.958 align:start position:0%
going to change the conditions the
 
06:10:05.190 --> 06:10:05.200 align:start position:0%
situation of their employment I mean the
 
06:10:07.070 --> 06:10:07.080 align:start position:0%
people that work together the medical
 
06:10:08.990 --> 06:10:09.000 align:start position:0%
professionals that work together in such
 
06:10:12.350 --> 06:10:12.360 align:start position:0%
a group do consult as needed that's you
 
06:10:13.750 --> 06:10:13.760 align:start position:0%
know that's part of the way it works the
 
06:10:16.070 --> 06:10:16.080 align:start position:0%
other thing is in the RSA existing in
 
06:10:18.030 --> 06:10:18.040 align:start position:0%
the RSA that's not affected by this bill
 
06:10:20.948 --> 06:10:20.958 align:start position:0%
or the amendment says phys Physicians
 
06:10:22.868 --> 06:10:22.878 align:start position:0%
assistance May provide any legal medical
 
06:10:24.070 --> 06:10:24.080 align:start position:0%
service for which they have been
 
06:10:26.750 --> 06:10:26.760 align:start position:0%
prepared by their education training and
 
06:10:29.150 --> 06:10:29.160 align:start position:0%
experience and are competent to perform
 
06:10:31.270 --> 06:10:31.280 align:start position:0%
medical and and then there's a list of
 
06:10:33.430 --> 06:10:33.440 align:start position:0%
ones that include are but not limited to
 
06:10:35.750 --> 06:10:35.760 align:start position:0%
which I'm not going to read so I mean
 
06:10:38.110 --> 06:10:38.120 align:start position:0%
they have to have had education training
 
06:10:41.230 --> 06:10:41.240 align:start position:0%
experience to legally be able to do
 
06:10:43.510 --> 06:10:43.520 align:start position:0%
anything um you know whether or not they
 
06:10:47.110 --> 06:10:47.120 align:start position:0%
have a collaboration agreement or not um
 
06:10:48.430 --> 06:10:48.440 align:start position:0%
if they're working as I said if they're
 
06:10:50.150 --> 06:10:50.160 align:start position:0%
working in a doctor's office or Hospital
 
06:10:51.230 --> 06:10:51.240 align:start position:0%
they're going to be under the super
 
06:10:52.190 --> 06:10:52.200 align:start position:0%
they're working for somebody they're
 
06:10:53.548 --> 06:10:53.558 align:start position:0%
going to be under their super
 
06:10:55.270 --> 06:10:55.280 align:start position:0%
supervision and apparently there are
 
06:10:58.788 --> 06:10:58.798 align:start position:0%
some number who are working um have been
 
06:11:01.628 --> 06:11:01.638 align:start position:0%
working independently in effect with a
 
06:11:03.190 --> 06:11:03.200 align:start position:0%
collaboration agreement with someone
 
06:11:06.548 --> 06:11:06.558 align:start position:0%
that they uh rarely interact with um so
 
06:11:09.230 --> 06:11:09.240 align:start position:0%
I really do not see anything which is
 
06:11:10.390 --> 06:11:10.400 align:start position:0%
going to
 
06:11:13.910 --> 06:11:13.920 align:start position:0%
change you know cause problems for for
 
06:11:15.468 --> 06:11:15.478 align:start position:0%
Pas who are currently
 
06:11:17.948 --> 06:11:17.958 align:start position:0%
working um and that's going to cause
 
06:11:21.030 --> 06:11:21.040 align:start position:0%
additional risk to uh people in New
 
06:11:23.830 --> 06:11:23.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but what I think it will do if
 
06:11:25.830 --> 06:11:25.840 align:start position:0%
we eliminate that is that there are
 
06:11:25.840 --> 06:11:27.468 align:start position:0%
we eliminate that is that there are
apparently

06:11:27.468 --> 06:11:27.478 align:start position:0%
apparently
 
06:11:29.628 --> 06:11:29.638 align:start position:0%
um places that would like to hire uh
 
06:11:32.270 --> 06:11:32.280 align:start position:0%
Physicians assistance but don't do that
 
06:11:33.868 --> 06:11:33.878 align:start position:0%
because of the requirement of having a
 
06:11:33.878 --> 06:11:35.110 align:start position:0%
because of the requirement of having a
collaboration

06:11:35.110 --> 06:11:35.120 align:start position:0%
collaboration
 
06:11:37.590 --> 06:11:37.600 align:start position:0%
agreement um and that's you know we had
 
06:11:38.868 --> 06:11:38.878 align:start position:0%
testimony on that and I was actually
 
06:11:40.910 --> 06:11:40.920 align:start position:0%
very surprised when I was looking at the
 
06:11:43.670 --> 06:11:43.680 align:start position:0%
Physicians um in our area or the people
 
06:11:46.110 --> 06:11:46.120 align:start position:0%
to have for Primary Care in our area
 
06:11:47.510 --> 06:11:47.520 align:start position:0%
under Southern New Hampshire family
 
06:11:49.590 --> 06:11:49.600 align:start position:0%
practices there were no Pas and I didn't
 
06:11:51.750 --> 06:11:51.760 align:start position:0%
understand why and it appears this is
 
06:11:55.270 --> 06:11:55.280 align:start position:0%
the reason and you know having a
 
06:11:56.510 --> 06:11:56.520 align:start position:0%
situation where they need to have a
 
06:11:57.868 --> 06:11:57.878 align:start position:0%
collaboration agreement for some number
 
06:12:01.430 --> 06:12:01.440 align:start position:0%
of hours I mean May offhand make sense
 
06:12:02.948 --> 06:12:02.958 align:start position:0%
but my concern is it's not going to
 
06:12:04.868 --> 06:12:04.878 align:start position:0%
solve that problem if they're had not
 
06:12:07.030 --> 06:12:07.040 align:start position:0%
getting hired and not able to be used in
 
06:12:09.788 --> 06:12:09.798 align:start position:0%
at least some areas because they can't
 
06:12:11.350 --> 06:12:11.360 align:start position:0%
they have a problem getting a doctor to
 
06:12:13.270 --> 06:12:13.280 align:start position:0%
assign a collaboration agreement for
 
06:12:15.430 --> 06:12:15.440 align:start position:0%
whatever reason then that that isn't
 
06:12:16.990 --> 06:12:17.000 align:start position:0%
going to be solved by by such an
 
06:12:19.590 --> 06:12:19.600 align:start position:0%
amendment and that's why um I intend to
 
06:12:20.670 --> 06:12:20.680 align:start position:0%
support the
 
06:12:25.430 --> 06:12:25.440 align:start position:0%
otpa okay anyone
 
06:12:25.440 --> 06:12:27.270 align:start position:0%
