Passion about this particular piece of
 
00:19:40.909 --> 00:19:40.919 align:start position:0%
legislation and the fact of the matter
 
00:19:44.350 --> 00:19:44.360 align:start position:0%
is regardless of what any of us feel
 
00:19:46.070 --> 00:19:46.080 align:start position:0%
about the possibility of cannabis
 
00:19:48.789 --> 00:19:48.799 align:start position:0%
becoming legal in New Hampshire it is
 
00:19:51.070 --> 00:19:51.080 align:start position:0%
not as of now
 
00:19:54.190 --> 00:19:54.200 align:start position:0%
legalized and this bill aims to make an
 
00:19:56.390 --> 00:19:56.400 align:start position:0%
inment process basically a
 
00:19:58.830 --> 00:19:58.840 align:start position:0%
blanket for anybody that may have had
 
00:20:00.990 --> 00:20:01.000 align:start position:0%
prior conviction because of
 
00:20:04.789 --> 00:20:04.799 align:start position:0%
cannabis we hear thousands of bills in
 
00:20:04.799 --> 00:20:06.190 align:start position:0%
cannabis we hear thousands of bills in
the

00:20:06.190 --> 00:20:06.200 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:20:09.430 --> 00:20:09.440 align:start position:0%
house many that will never become law
 
00:20:11.029 --> 00:20:11.039 align:start position:0%
just because this subject is being
 
00:20:12.549 --> 00:20:12.559 align:start position:0%
discussed does not mean that that's
 
00:20:14.430 --> 00:20:14.440 align:start position:0%
going to
 
00:20:14.440 --> 00:20:15.950 align:start position:0%
going to
happen

00:20:15.950 --> 00:20:15.960 align:start position:0%
happen
 
00:20:17.909 --> 00:20:17.919 align:start position:0%
additionally the way this bill is
 
00:20:20.990 --> 00:20:21.000 align:start position:0%
written it will put the erroneous on the
 
00:20:24.029 --> 00:20:24.039 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire families to be responsible
 
00:20:25.470 --> 00:20:25.480 align:start position:0%
for the inment
 
00:20:27.750 --> 00:20:27.760 align:start position:0%
process I find it really hard to believe
 
00:20:29.950 --> 00:20:29.960 align:start position:0%
that any of us should have to pay for
 
00:20:32.070 --> 00:20:32.080 align:start position:0%
someone else's analment hearing we
 
00:20:33.470 --> 00:20:33.480 align:start position:0%
didn't do the
 
00:20:37.430 --> 00:20:37.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:40.430 --> 00:20:40.440 align:start position:0%
convictions cannabis was illegal and it
 
00:20:40.440 --> 00:20:41.710 align:start position:0%
convictions cannabis was illegal and it
still

00:20:41.710 --> 00:20:41.720 align:start position:0%
still
 
00:20:44.630 --> 00:20:44.640 align:start position:0%
is this does not take any of that into
 
00:20:44.640 --> 00:20:49.549 align:start position:0%
is this does not take any of that into
effect

00:20:49.549 --> 00:20:49.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:53.350 --> 00:20:53.360 align:start position:0%
whatsoever RSA 651 has a very defined
 
00:20:56.149 --> 00:20:56.159 align:start position:0%
process for annulments that is
 
00:20:59.310 --> 00:20:59.320 align:start position:0%
working my suggestion is if we want to
 
00:21:01.590 --> 00:21:01.600 align:start position:0%
streamline the process if and when
 
00:21:04.390 --> 00:21:04.400 align:start position:0%
cannabis becomes legal then let's put
 
00:21:06.190 --> 00:21:06.200 align:start position:0%
that language into one of the Cannabis
 
00:21:09.710 --> 00:21:09.720 align:start position:0%
bills not a whole separate piece of
 
00:21:11.750 --> 00:21:11.760 align:start position:0%
legislation thank you Mr
 
00:21:20.750 --> 00:21:20.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:24.230 --> 00:21:24.240 align:start position:0%
wheeler thank you Mr Speaker the current
 
00:21:27.510 --> 00:21:27.520 align:start position:0%
process for annulments has people paying
 
00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:29.310 align:start position:0%
process for annulments has people paying
$300

00:21:29.310 --> 00:21:29.320 align:start position:0%
$300
 
00:21:32.549 --> 00:21:32.559 align:start position:0%
to request a hearing to get their
 
00:21:37.029 --> 00:21:37.039 align:start position:0%
conviction anold and as we discuss here
 
00:21:39.870 --> 00:21:39.880 align:start position:0%
in this body the legalization and not
 
00:21:43.549 --> 00:21:43.559 align:start position:0%
just legalization but sale of cannabis
 
00:21:45.750 --> 00:21:45.760 align:start position:0%
where the state will be selling this
 
00:21:48.630 --> 00:21:48.640 align:start position:0%
drug I and the 14 members of the
 
00:21:50.950 --> 00:21:50.960 align:start position:0%
criminal justice committee who voted
 
00:21:53.110 --> 00:21:53.120 align:start position:0%
ought to pass on this legislation felt
 
00:21:55.909 --> 00:21:55.919 align:start position:0%
that it was an egregious wrong that we
 
00:21:58.029 --> 00:21:58.039 align:start position:0%
should be discussing the legalization
 
00:22:01.750 --> 00:22:01.760 align:start position:0%
and sales of cannabis while people are
 
00:22:03.990 --> 00:22:04.000 align:start position:0%
stopped from getting loans or getting
 
00:22:07.830 --> 00:22:07.840 align:start position:0%
jobs or moving forward in the process of
 
00:22:09.789 --> 00:22:09.799 align:start position:0%
Rehabilitation because of a cannabis
 
00:22:12.110 --> 00:22:12.120 align:start position:0%
conviction on their record the bill
 
00:22:13.750 --> 00:22:13.760 align:start position:0%
before us HB
 
00:22:16.950 --> 00:22:16.960 align:start position:0%
1539 would set up a process by which the
 
00:22:19.630 --> 00:22:19.640 align:start position:0%
department of safety would observe all
 
00:22:22.390 --> 00:22:22.400 align:start position:0%
the people in their records and see if
 
00:22:25.269 --> 00:22:25.279 align:start position:0%
anyone meets the criteria of solely a
 
00:22:28.230 --> 00:22:28.240 align:start position:0%
cannabis conviction and that would then
 
00:22:31.950 --> 00:22:31.960 align:start position:0%
be eligible for an analment hearing that
 
00:22:33.470 --> 00:22:33.480 align:start position:0%
doesn't guarantee that you're going to
 
00:22:36.510 --> 00:22:36.520 align:start position:0%
get an analment it guarantees you a
 
00:22:39.510 --> 00:22:39.520 align:start position:0%
hearing some people deserve an analment
 
00:22:42.470 --> 00:22:42.480 align:start position:0%
some people might not the legislation is
 
00:22:44.590 --> 00:22:44.600 align:start position:0%
very clear and I think the majority
 
00:22:47.070 --> 00:22:47.080 align:start position:0%
report handles this
 
00:22:50.669 --> 00:22:50.679 align:start position:0%
well nobody who has pled down from a
 
00:22:54.630 --> 00:22:54.640 align:start position:0%
crime which was more than solely the
 
00:22:57.149 --> 00:22:57.159 align:start position:0%
Cannabis charge is eligible for the
 
00:22:59.510 --> 00:22:59.520 align:start position:0%
hearing they aren't eligible to get the
 
00:23:04.310 --> 00:23:04.320 align:start position:0%
analment nobody who had gotten a
 
00:23:06.830 --> 00:23:06.840 align:start position:0%
cannabis conviction above the limit
 
00:23:09.549 --> 00:23:09.559 align:start position:0%
that's put forth in the bill can get
 
00:23:12.590 --> 00:23:12.600 align:start position:0%
even a hearing and the bill does not say
 
00:23:14.669 --> 00:23:14.679 align:start position:0%
that people are automatically eligible
 
00:23:16.710 --> 00:23:16.720 align:start position:0%
for an nments it says that you're able
 
00:23:19.630 --> 00:23:19.640 align:start position:0%
to get your hearing and I think uh a
 
00:23:22.669 --> 00:23:22.679 align:start position:0%
fair process before the courts uh just
 
00:23:24.430 --> 00:23:24.440 align:start position:0%
demonstrating that you have
 
00:23:26.510 --> 00:23:26.520 align:start position:0%
rehabilitated yourself demonstrating
 
00:23:29.269 --> 00:23:29.279 align:start position:0%
that you are on the process to
 
00:23:31.909 --> 00:23:31.919 align:start position:0%
Rehabilitation uh showing that you want
 
00:23:34.110 --> 00:23:34.120 align:start position:0%
to get a job you want to get a loan for
 
00:23:35.909 --> 00:23:35.919 align:start position:0%
whatever that business that you want to
 
00:23:38.230 --> 00:23:38.240 align:start position:0%
start is or the school that you want to
 
00:23:40.510 --> 00:23:40.520 align:start position:0%
go to is and making sure that you can
 
00:23:44.630 --> 00:23:44.640 align:start position:0%
live a full life that's what HB 1539 is
 
00:23:47.070 --> 00:23:47.080 align:start position:0%
so I appreciate the passion from my
 
00:23:48.909 --> 00:23:48.919 align:start position:0%
friend from the minority of the
 
00:23:50.630 --> 00:23:50.640 align:start position:0%
committee on this legislation but I
 
00:23:54.190 --> 00:23:54.200 align:start position:0%
would ask the house to consider the fact
 
00:23:56.990 --> 00:23:57.000 align:start position:0%
it's a little hypocritical for us to be
 
00:24:02.530 --> 00:24:02.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:02.540 --> 00:25:00.630 align:start position:0%

00:25:00.630 --> 00:25:00.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:02.669 --> 00:25:02.679 align:start position:0%
heran thank you Mr Speaker and thank you
 
00:25:04.590 --> 00:25:04.600 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question it
 
00:25:07.149 --> 00:25:07.159 align:start position:0%
it was stated previously that cannabis
 
00:25:09.909 --> 00:25:09.919 align:start position:0%
is still illegal in New Hampshire but it
 
00:25:11.830 --> 00:25:11.840 align:start position:0%
isn't it true that it's now a civil
 
00:25:13.750 --> 00:25:13.760 align:start position:0%
offense and the people were talking
 
00:25:16.029 --> 00:25:16.039 align:start position:0%
about having a chance to get rid of
 
00:25:17.990 --> 00:25:18.000 align:start position:0%
their convictions were convicted as a of
 
00:25:20.710 --> 00:25:20.720 align:start position:0%
a criminal offense and that's a major
 
00:25:22.310 --> 00:25:22.320 align:start position:0%
difference in the law that's
 
00:25:27.350 --> 00:25:27.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:29.389 --> 00:25:29.399 align:start position:0%
representative representative Granger
 
00:25:30.870 --> 00:25:30.880 align:start position:0%
has requested a roll call is that
 
00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:34.269 align:start position:0%
has requested a roll call is that

00:25:42.990 --> 00:25:43.000 align:start position:0%
seconded I will reemphasize that when I
 
00:25:44.830 --> 00:25:44.840 align:start position:0%
ask for a second on a roll call you need
 
00:25:57.310 --> 00:25:57.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:57.320 --> 00:26:27.310 align:start position:0%

inquiry thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker
 
00:27:06.190 --> 00:27:06.200 align:start position:0%
if I know that the way this bill is
 
00:27:09.070 --> 00:27:09.080 align:start position:0%
written it's going to put the the
 
00:27:10.990 --> 00:27:11.000 align:start position:0%
liability on the New Hampshire taxpayers
 
00:27:12.470 --> 00:27:12.480 align:start position:0%

people's annulments and if I know at the

time that this that this was illegal and
 
00:27:22.110 --> 00:27:22.120 align:start position:0%
that the law was broken would I vote no

it with the uh various members of this

body and we heard you um it was overly
 
00:34:29.990 --> 00:34:30.000 align:start position:0%
Broad and it could be used to make

someone show up if they didn't want to
 
00:34:34.069 --> 00:34:34.079 align:start position:0%
as part of their defense having said
 
00:34:36.950 --> 00:34:36.960 align:start position:0%
that this floor Amendment only does this
 
00:34:39.310 --> 00:34:39.320 align:start position:0%
the defendant has to show up in court
 
00:34:41.550 --> 00:34:41.560 align:start position:0%
for the reading of the verdict and for
 
00:34:43.950 --> 00:34:43.960 align:start position:0%
the sentencing again for the reading of

jury spends the time to hear this case
 
00:34:51.030 --> 00:34:51.040 align:start position:0%
the defendant should take the time to go
 
00:34:53.470 --> 00:34:53.480 align:start position:0%
in and respect that jury and hear their
 
00:34:55.829 --> 00:34:55.839 align:start position:0%

amendment thank you Mr Speaker today I
 
00:37:02.750 --> 00:37:02.760 align:start position:0%
rise in opposition to Amendment 1159 H
 
00:37:04.670 --> 00:37:04.680 align:start position:0%
one would hope an amendment to a bill
 
00:37:07.230 --> 00:37:07.240 align:start position:0%
would make it better in this case it
 
00:37:10.670 --> 00:37:10.680 align:start position:0%
does not in fact it does nothing to
 
00:37:14.030 --> 00:37:14.040 align:start position:0%
address the intent of House Bill 1014 to
 
00:37:16.390 --> 00:37:16.400 align:start position:0%
encourage student voter registration and
 
00:37:19.309 --> 00:37:19.319 align:start position:0%
Civic engagement which is a challenge
 
00:37:22.950 --> 00:37:22.960 align:start position:0%
given that in the 22 midterms only
 
00:37:25.510 --> 00:37:25.520 align:start position:0%
15.6% of New Hampshire 18y olds
 
00:37:28.230 --> 00:37:28.240 align:start position:0%
registered to vote 15
 
00:37:30.790 --> 00:37:30.800 align:start position:0%
6% this amendment includes what is
 
00:37:32.910 --> 00:37:32.920 align:start position:0%
already in statute that Civics
 
00:37:34.870 --> 00:37:34.880 align:start position:0%
instruction must include teaching about
 
00:37:37.150 --> 00:37:37.160 align:start position:0%
the role opportunities and
 
00:37:39.470 --> 00:37:39.480 align:start position:0%
responsibilities of a citizen to engage
 
00:37:43.150 --> 00:37:43.160 align:start position:0%
in Civic activity the amended language
 
00:37:45.349 --> 00:37:45.359 align:start position:0%
requires that election and voting laws
 
00:37:47.109 --> 00:37:47.119 align:start position:0%
also be included in the Civics
 
00:37:49.589 --> 00:37:49.599 align:start position:0%
curriculum which I would argue is
 
00:37:52.750 --> 00:37:52.760 align:start position:0%
already included in the law how what is
 
00:37:54.950 --> 00:37:54.960 align:start position:0%
problematic in is that the amendment
 
00:37:58.030 --> 00:37:58.040 align:start position:0%
strikes out the entire language on voter
 
00:38:00.470 --> 00:38:00.480 align:start position:0%
registration which requires each school
 
00:38:02.430 --> 00:38:02.440 align:start position:0%
district and private high school to
 
00:38:04.870 --> 00:38:04.880 align:start position:0%
adopt a policy with Provisions for
 
00:38:08.270 --> 00:38:08.280 align:start position:0%
informing eligible students about voter
 
00:38:10.790 --> 00:38:10.800 align:start position:0%
registration laws and for filing voter
 
00:38:13.790 --> 00:38:13.800 align:start position:0%
registration applications it's important
 
00:38:16.349 --> 00:38:16.359 align:start position:0%
to note that promoting registration is
 
00:38:19.109 --> 00:38:19.119 align:start position:0%
key to encouraging young students to
 
00:38:21.910 --> 00:38:21.920 align:start position:0%
vote Civics credits can be earned in
 
00:38:24.390 --> 00:38:24.400 align:start position:0%
grades 9 through 12 which means that
 
00:38:27.190 --> 00:38:27.200 align:start position:0%
some students are 14 or 15 years old
 
00:38:29.990 --> 00:38:30.000 align:start position:0%
while enrolled in their civics class
 
00:38:32.270 --> 00:38:32.280 align:start position:0%
receiving a copy of the Constitution and
 
00:38:33.950 --> 00:38:33.960 align:start position:0%
being taught about voting and election
 
00:38:37.190 --> 00:38:37.200 align:start position:0%
laws in ninth grade is vastly different
 
00:38:39.349 --> 00:38:39.359 align:start position:0%
than three years later when students are
 
00:38:41.470 --> 00:38:41.480 align:start position:0%
old enough to apply their knowledge to a
 
00:38:44.589 --> 00:38:44.599 align:start position:0%
real world situation that is registering
 
00:38:46.950 --> 00:38:46.960 align:start position:0%
to vote if they so
 
00:38:49.750 --> 00:38:49.760 align:start position:0%
choose this amendment completely negates
 
00:38:52.550 --> 00:38:52.560 align:start position:0%
the intent of House Bill 1014 to
 
00:38:54.470 --> 00:38:54.480 align:start position:0%
increase New Hampshire student voter
 
00:38:56.910 --> 00:38:56.920 align:start position:0%
registration and to encourage more youth
 
00:38:59.750 --> 00:38:59.760 align:start position:0%
Civic engagement please vote no on this
 
00:39:01.470 --> 00:39:01.480 align:start position:0%

00:39:04.230 --> 00:39:04.240 align:start position:0%

00:39:46.750 --> 00:39:46.760 align:start position:0%
Municipal staff mainly Town clerks and

supervisors of the checklist as well as
 
00:39:52.950 --> 00:39:52.960 align:start position:0%

00:39:56.510 --> 00:39:56.520 align:start position:0%
districts the amendment however removes
 
00:40:01.069 --> 00:40:01.079 align:start position:0%
the burden by removing the Mandate also
 
00:40:03.349 --> 00:40:03.359 align:start position:0%
the amendment addresses a number of
 
00:40:05.390 --> 00:40:05.400 align:start position:0%
concerns raised by the Secretary of
 
00:40:08.550 --> 00:40:08.560 align:start position:0%
State's office specifically registration
 
00:40:13.069 --> 00:40:13.079 align:start position:0%

if I Know That explicit systematic
 
00:53:55.630 --> 00:53:55.640 align:start position:0%
phonic Bas instruction was the gold has
 
00:53:57.390 --> 00:53:57.400 align:start position:0%
been the gold standard for teaching
 
00:54:00.430 --> 00:54:00.440 align:start position:0%
reading since 1935 when Orton Gillingham
 
00:54:02.390 --> 00:54:02.400 align:start position:0%
the grandfather of all phonics-based
 
00:54:05.950 --> 00:54:05.960 align:start position:0%
reading programs introduces method for
 
00:54:08.270 --> 00:54:08.280 align:start position:0%
teaching students with
 
00:54:10.589 --> 00:54:10.599 align:start position:0%
dyslexia and if I know this method of
 
00:54:13.109 --> 00:54:13.119 align:start position:0%
teaching the five components of reading
 
00:54:14.950 --> 00:54:14.960 align:start position:0%
has been used in New Hampshire special
 
00:54:17.910 --> 00:54:17.920 align:start position:0%
education classrooms well before I was
 
00:54:20.990 --> 00:54:21.000 align:start position:0%
trained to be a special educator 25
 
00:54:24.470 --> 00:54:24.480 align:start position:0%
years ago and if I further know that
 
00:54:26.950 --> 00:54:26.960 align:start position:0%
this gold standard of explicit
 
00:54:29.309 --> 00:54:29.319 align:start position:0%
systematic instruction in Reading
 
00:54:32.349 --> 00:54:32.359 align:start position:0%
Writing and math could easily be
 
00:54:34.309 --> 00:54:34.319 align:start position:0%
implemented in the general education
 
00:54:37.150 --> 00:54:37.160 align:start position:0%
classroom to meet the needs of all
 
00:54:40.150 --> 00:54:40.160 align:start position:0%
students and if I further know that the
 
00:54:42.589 --> 00:54:42.599 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Department of Education
 
00:54:44.589 --> 00:54:44.599 align:start position:0%
wisely offered a professional
 
00:54:46.910 --> 00:54:46.920 align:start position:0%
development program in phonics based
 
00:54:49.829 --> 00:54:49.839 align:start position:0%
instruction called letters well before
 
00:54:53.510 --> 00:54:53.520 align:start position:0%
the schools uh were shut down for covid
 
00:54:55.789 --> 00:54:55.799 align:start position:0%
and thousands of teachers and parents
 
00:54:57.870 --> 00:54:57.880 align:start position:0%
have participated ated in that
 
00:55:01.150 --> 00:55:01.160 align:start position:0%
program and most importantly Mr Speaker
 
00:55:04.030 --> 00:55:04.040 align:start position:0%
if I know that school districts around
 
00:55:07.390 --> 00:55:07.400 align:start position:0%
our state have already begun screening
 
00:55:10.789 --> 00:55:10.799 align:start position:0%
students for reading disabilities and as
 
00:55:13.589 --> 00:55:13.599 align:start position:0%
we speak many school districts are
 
00:55:15.710 --> 00:55:15.720 align:start position:0%
piloting phonics based reading programs
 
00:55:18.309 --> 00:55:18.319 align:start position:0%
that utilize systematic explicit
 
00:55:20.670 --> 00:55:20.680 align:start position:0%
systematic instruction then I would

comprehensive approach to improving
 
00:58:49.430 --> 00:58:49.440 align:start position:0%

three years and not pay attention to all
 
00:58:54.870 --> 00:58:54.880 align:start position:0%
pro aspects of the literacy problem in
 
00:58:57.829 --> 00:58:57.839 align:start position:0%

00:59:01.150 --> 00:59:01.160 align:start position:0%
of two years work with national and
 
00:59:04.309 --> 00:59:04.319 align:start position:0%

interventionists it all starts with how
 
00:59:19.309 --> 00:59:19.319 align:start position:0%
we teach reading research has been done
 
00:59:22.390 --> 00:59:22.400 align:start position:0%
for decades on the way students learn to
 
00:59:25.549 --> 00:59:25.559 align:start position:0%
read and how their brains actually work
 
00:59:28.510 --> 00:59:28.520 align:start position:0%
this body of research and evidence-based
 
00:59:30.910 --> 00:59:30.920 align:start position:0%
research has been termed the science of
 
00:59:34.150 --> 00:59:34.160 align:start position:0%
reading we must move away from the old
 
00:59:36.750 --> 00:59:36.760 align:start position:0%
discredited methods in use in many
 
00:59:39.309 --> 00:59:39.319 align:start position:0%
school districts in New Hampshire so
 
00:59:42.670 --> 00:59:42.680 align:start position:0%
what does this amendment do first the
 
00:59:45.390 --> 00:59:45.400 align:start position:0%
Department of Education will evaluate
 
00:59:47.950 --> 00:59:47.960 align:start position:0%
and contract for a universal reading
 
00:59:50.870 --> 00:59:50.880 align:start position:0%
screener to be used by all
 
00:59:53.150 --> 00:59:53.160 align:start position:0%
districts that contract has to be in
 
00:59:55.870 --> 00:59:55.880 align:start position:0%
place by next January they will also
 
00:59:58.309 --> 00:59:58.319 align:start position:0%
Prov provide training on the use of that
 
01:00:01.230 --> 01:00:01.240 align:start position:0%
screener the screener will do various
 
01:00:04.029 --> 01:00:04.039 align:start position:0%
things including check for descrip
 
01:00:06.470 --> 01:00:06.480 align:start position:0%
deficiencies in a student's reading
 
01:00:09.349 --> 01:00:09.359 align:start position:0%
recommend interventions for that student
 
01:00:12.789 --> 01:00:12.799 align:start position:0%
relieve teachers of data entry work and
 
01:00:15.549 --> 01:00:15.559 align:start position:0%
some of these systems also included a

average you remember that I asked the
 
01:02:44.789 --> 01:02:44.799 align:start position:0%
number to remember was
 
01:02:49.950 --> 01:02:49.960 align:start position:0%
52 52 is the average State proficiency
 
01:02:54.510 --> 01:02:54.520 align:start position:0%
rating in our schools today 52% 48% are
 
01:02:56.589 --> 01:02:56.599 align:start position:0%
not proficient
 
01:02:57.910 --> 01:02:57.920 align:start position:0%
we cannot
 
01:03:01.190 --> 01:03:01.200 align:start position:0%
wait we can't continue to he hear about
 
01:03:05.109 --> 01:03:05.119 align:start position:0%
mental health in schools maybe is mental
 
01:03:07.589 --> 01:03:07.599 align:start position:0%
health problems are due to anxiety
 
01:03:10.829 --> 01:03:10.839 align:start position:0%
because students can't properly read and
 
01:03:13.069 --> 01:03:13.079 align:start position:0%
are having difficulty keeping up with

work this cannot

continue we need a comprehensive

approach that this amendment offers we
 
01:03:24.710 --> 01:03:24.720 align:start position:0%
have to turn things around now we can't
 
01:03:27.630 --> 01:03:27.640 align:start position:0%
just tell districts to move to the new
 
01:03:30.430 --> 01:03:30.440 align:start position:0%
methods in three years we cannot tell
 
01:03:33.630 --> 01:03:33.640 align:start position:0%
the kids to do the best you can waiting
 
01:03:36.789 --> 01:03:36.799 align:start position:0%
means failure please vote green on this

inquiry thank you Mr Speaker if I know
 
01:05:21.109 --> 01:05:21.119 align:start position:0%
that this amendment repeals the dyslexia
 
01:05:24.430 --> 01:05:24.440 align:start position:0%
screening law that we just voted on last
 
01:05:26.269 --> 01:05:26.279 align:start position:0%
session and went into effect act in
 
01:05:26.279 --> 01:05:28.269 align:start position:0%
session and went into effect act in
September

01:05:28.269 --> 01:05:28.279 align:start position:0%
September
 
01:05:31.150 --> 01:05:31.160 align:start position:0%
2023 and if I know that this amendment
 
01:05:33.950 --> 01:05:33.960 align:start position:0%
narrowly focuses on the 48% of students
 
01:05:36.910 --> 01:05:36.920 align:start position:0%
who score below Proficiency in reading
 
01:05:39.549 --> 01:05:39.559 align:start position:0%
but does nothing to address the needs of
 
01:05:42.630 --> 01:05:42.640 align:start position:0%
the 58% of students who scored below
 
01:05:46.390 --> 01:05:46.400 align:start position:0%
Proficiency in math or the 62% of
 
01:05:49.069 --> 01:05:49.079 align:start position:0%
students who scored below Proficiency in
 
01:05:51.990 --> 01:05:52.000 align:start position:0%
science and if I know that children's
 
01:05:54.910 --> 01:05:54.920 align:start position:0%
brains develop at different rates and it
 
01:05:56.230 --> 01:05:56.240 align:start position:0%
is our curricul
 
01:05:58.829 --> 01:05:58.839 align:start position:0%
that changes at third grade and not our
 
01:06:01.029 --> 01:06:01.039 align:start position:0%
students brains indicating the
 
01:06:03.910 --> 01:06:03.920 align:start position:0%
importance of explicit systematic uh
 
01:06:06.349 --> 01:06:06.359 align:start position:0%
instruction continuing through grade
 
01:06:09.150 --> 01:06:09.160 align:start position:0%
five something that is not done in this
 
01:06:11.549 --> 01:06:11.559 align:start position:0%
amendment and if I further know that
 
01:06:13.109 --> 01:06:13.119 align:start position:0%
this amendment places additional
 
01:06:15.710 --> 01:06:15.720 align:start position:0%
unnecessary requirements on Educators
 
01:06:18.269 --> 01:06:18.279 align:start position:0%
renewing their license in a time when
 
01:06:20.230 --> 01:06:20.240 align:start position:0%
districts are struggling to retain
 
01:06:22.549 --> 01:06:22.559 align:start position:0%
experienced Educators and Recruit new
 
01:06:24.510 --> 01:06:24.520 align:start position:0%
Educators to fill job
 
01:06:26.710 --> 01:06:26.720 align:start position:0%
openings and and if I further knowe that
 
01:06:29.069 --> 01:06:29.079 align:start position:0%
this amendment provides no time for
 
01:06:31.390 --> 01:06:31.400 align:start position:0%
districts to Pilot new programs or
 
01:06:31.400 --> 01:06:32.309 align:start position:0%
districts to Pilot new programs or
budget

01:06:32.309 --> 01:06:32.319 align:start position:0%
budget
 
01:06:35.670 --> 01:06:35.680 align:start position:0%
funds and also undermines clal control
 
01:06:37.750 --> 01:06:37.760 align:start position:0%
by being too prescription too
 
01:06:39.789 --> 01:06:39.799 align:start position:0%
prescriptive in its overreaching
 
01:06:41.870 --> 01:06:41.880 align:start position:0%
burdensome approach to creating a
 
01:06:43.950 --> 01:06:43.960 align:start position:0%
comprehensive reading plan with little
 
01:06:46.109 --> 01:06:46.119 align:start position:0%
input from the local
 
01:06:50.109 --> 01:06:50.119 align:start position:0%
Educators and Mr Speaker if I know I
 
01:06:52.870 --> 01:06:52.880 align:start position:0%
have no idea how much this amendment
 
01:06:55.829 --> 01:06:55.839 align:start position:0%
will cost the taxpayers it could be
 
01:06:58.309 --> 01:06:58.319 align:start position:0%
million it could be 5 million or
 
01:07:00.789 --> 01:07:00.799 align:start position:0%
potentially it could be $10 million
 
01:07:02.470 --> 01:07:02.480 align:start position:0%
added to our
 
01:07:04.950 --> 01:07:04.960 align:start position:0%
budget at a time when taxpayers are
 
01:07:07.430 --> 01:07:07.440 align:start position:0%
already having difficulty paying their
 
01:07:09.630 --> 01:07:09.640 align:start position:0%
property taxes representative this is a
 
01:07:11.150 --> 01:07:11.160 align:start position:0%
pi not a
 
01:07:14.069 --> 01:07:14.079 align:start position:0%
speech other household expensives then I
 
01:07:15.670 --> 01:07:15.680 align:start position:0%
would press the red
 
01:07:18.470 --> 01:07:18.480 align:start position:0%
button and support a more sensible
 
01:07:21.670 --> 01:07:21.680 align:start position:0%
amendment that we just passed to address
 
01:07:23.870 --> 01:07:23.880 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's low proficiency scores
 
01:07:26.230 --> 01:07:26.240 align:start position:0%
in Reading Writing and math
 
01:07:28.750 --> 01:07:28.760 align:start position:0%
thank you chair recognize representative

01:07:38.990 --> 01:07:39.000 align:start position:0%
inquiry thank you and good morning Mr
 
01:07:41.950 --> 01:07:41.960 align:start position:0%
Speaker if I know it is
 
01:07:44.910 --> 01:07:44.920 align:start position:0%
unacceptable that 48% of our students in
 
01:07:48.150 --> 01:07:48.160 align:start position:0%
this state are not proficient in
 
01:07:51.589 --> 01:07:51.599 align:start position:0%
Reading if I know this amendment better
 
01:07:54.549 --> 01:07:54.559 align:start position:0%
supports an EV evidence-based
 
01:07:56.510 --> 01:07:56.520 align:start position:0%
comprehensive approach to teaching
 
01:08:00.029 --> 01:08:00.039 align:start position:0%

01:08:00.039 --> 01:08:01.630 align:start position:0%

01:08:01.630 --> 01:08:01.640 align:start position:0%
awareness
 
01:08:05.309 --> 01:08:05.319 align:start position:0%
fluency vocabulary comprehension and
 
01:08:08.750 --> 01:08:08.760 align:start position:0%
contains a strong assessment component
 
01:08:12.150 --> 01:08:12.160 align:start position:0%
and required teacher training and if I
 
01:08:15.390 --> 01:08:15.400 align:start position:0%
note Research indicates that on average
 
01:08:18.070 --> 01:08:18.080 align:start position:0%
children who are taught phonics get off
 
01:08:20.789 --> 01:08:20.799 align:start position:0%
to a better start and learning to read
 
01:08:23.950 --> 01:08:23.960 align:start position:0%
than children who are not taught phonics
 
01:08:26.229 --> 01:08:26.239 align:start position:0%
would I then press the green button
 
01:08:29.550 --> 01:08:29.560 align:start position:0%

scattered more than the other colors
 
01:12:33.750 --> 01:12:33.760 align:start position:0%
because it takes a shorter smaller wave

you to pause for a moment step back from

the understandably strong emotions
 
01:40:07.830 --> 01:40:07.840 align:start position:0%
around our shared concerns with pandemic
 
01:40:10.550 --> 01:40:10.560 align:start position:0%
history and the impacts of masking so
 
01:40:12.550 --> 01:40:12.560 align:start position:0%
that together we can consider the best

8-year-old second grade student will
 
01:40:22.229 --> 01:40:22.239 align:start position:0%
call her Lydia you've had surgery to
 
01:40:23.910 --> 01:40:23.920 align:start position:0%
remove a brain tumor and are now
 
01:40:26.030 --> 01:40:26.040 align:start position:0%
undergoing chemotherapy for months to
 
01:40:29.390 --> 01:40:29.400 align:start position:0%
come as many of us know chemo saves
 
01:40:32.149 --> 01:40:32.159 align:start position:0%
lives but also often has profound side
 
01:40:35.310 --> 01:40:35.320 align:start position:0%
effects most commonly it greatly reduces
 
01:40:38.030 --> 01:40:38.040 align:start position:0%
immunity which gets our little girl very
 
01:40:41.229 --> 01:40:41.239 align:start position:0%
vulnerable to any contagious illness

01:40:46.589 --> 01:40:46.599 align:start position:0%
has not been able to attend for over a
 
01:40:50.350 --> 01:40:50.360 align:start position:0%

01:40:52.430 --> 01:40:52.440 align:start position:0%
her return to school with the
 
01:40:54.109 --> 01:40:54.119 align:start position:0%
qualification that she and her
 
01:40:57.189 --> 01:40:57.199 align:start position:0%
classmates routinely wear masks to
 
01:40:59.109 --> 01:40:59.119 align:start position:0%
protect her from what could be a fatal
 
01:41:01.189 --> 01:41:01.199 align:start position:0%
illness she is
 
01:41:06.229 --> 01:41:06.239 align:start position:0%
elated yet under HB 1093 Lydia would not
 
01:41:08.189 --> 01:41:08.199 align:start position:0%
be able to return too the M will suspend
 
01:41:09.189 --> 01:41:09.199 align:start position:0%

01:41:19.350 --> 01:41:19.360 align:start position:0%

01:41:21.470 --> 01:41:21.480 align:start position:0%
to have a conversation take it out into

Speaker under HB 1093 Lydia would not be
 
01:41:36.430 --> 01:41:36.440 align:start position:0%

fellow students to mask for her safety I
 
01:41:43.910 --> 01:41:43.920 align:start position:0%
ask you is that fair and
 
01:41:46.790 --> 01:41:46.800 align:start position:0%
reasonable as a health care professional
 
01:41:48.669 --> 01:41:48.679 align:start position:0%
I know that science is constantly
 
01:41:51.229 --> 01:41:51.239 align:start position:0%
evolving we make decisions with what we
 
01:41:53.390 --> 01:41:53.400 align:start position:0%
know and understand at a given point
 
01:41:55.709 --> 01:41:55.719 align:start position:0%
point in time the changes in
 
01:41:58.030 --> 01:41:58.040 align:start position:0%
recommendations can be frustrating and
 
01:42:00.350 --> 01:42:00.360 align:start position:0%
confusing that doesn't mean we shouldn't
 
01:42:00.360 --> 01:42:01.470 align:start position:0%
confusing that doesn't mean we shouldn't
adjust

01:42:01.470 --> 01:42:01.480 align:start position:0%
adjust
 
01:42:04.709 --> 01:42:04.719 align:start position:0%
recommendations for example a simple and
 
01:42:07.870 --> 01:42:07.880 align:start position:0%
not particularly emotion Laden topic do
 
01:42:09.950 --> 01:42:09.960 align:start position:0%
eggs raise cholesterol or could we
 
01:42:12.629 --> 01:42:12.639 align:start position:0%
freely eat them every day over the
 
01:42:14.709 --> 01:42:14.719 align:start position:0%
course of my career as a dietitian the
 
01:42:16.350 --> 01:42:16.360 align:start position:0%
answer to that question changed more
 
01:42:19.109 --> 01:42:19.119 align:start position:0%
than once when we finally determined
 
01:42:21.350 --> 01:42:21.360 align:start position:0%
that despite being high in cholesterol
 
01:42:23.790 --> 01:42:23.800 align:start position:0%
eggs do not significantly increase human
 
01:42:26.189 --> 01:42:26.199 align:start position:0%
cholesterol levels it was great to share
 
01:42:28.990 --> 01:42:29.000 align:start position:0%
that good news with patients during
 
01:42:32.189 --> 01:42:32.199 align:start position:0%
covid the virus itself changed the rates
 
01:42:34.830 --> 01:42:34.840 align:start position:0%
of infection in communities fluctuated
 
01:42:37.310 --> 01:42:37.320 align:start position:0%
and experts adjusted guidance as new
 
01:42:39.830 --> 01:42:39.840 align:start position:0%
knowledge became available that is the
 
01:42:41.990 --> 01:42:42.000 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable but wonderful reality of
 
01:42:44.310 --> 01:42:44.320 align:start position:0%
science as we keep learning our
 
01:42:46.270 --> 01:42:46.280 align:start position:0%
approaches to Wellness
 
01:42:49.390 --> 01:42:49.400 align:start position:0%
evolve the covid pandemic changed us our
 
01:42:50.990 --> 01:42:51.000 align:start position:0%
Public Health knowledge is vastly
 
01:42:53.310 --> 01:42:53.320 align:start position:0%
different than four years ago the
 
01:42:55.229 --> 01:42:55.239 align:start position:0%
recommendations that led to masking in
 
01:42:56.870 --> 01:42:56.880 align:start position:0%
schools throughout the pandemic were
 
01:42:59.470 --> 01:42:59.480 align:start position:0%
from the best of intentions based on the
 
01:43:01.149 --> 01:43:01.159 align:start position:0%
knowledge of that
 
01:43:04.750 --> 01:43:04.760 align:start position:0%
time HB 1093 seeks to prohibit public
 
01:43:06.790 --> 01:43:06.800 align:start position:0%
school districts from adopting enforcing
 
01:43:08.910 --> 01:43:08.920 align:start position:0%
or implementing
 
01:43:11.229 --> 01:43:11.239 align:start position:0%
policies requiring students of the
 
01:43:13.870 --> 01:43:13.880 align:start position:0%
public to wear a mask well on school
 
01:43:16.830 --> 01:43:16.840 align:start position:0%
property since none of us has a reliable
 
01:43:19.550 --> 01:43:19.560 align:start position:0%
crystal ball we cannot predict our
 
01:43:22.750 --> 01:43:22.760 align:start position:0%
future challenges we simply cannot know
 
01:43:24.510 --> 01:43:24.520 align:start position:0%
whether it would be valuable to require
 
01:43:27.310 --> 01:43:27.320 align:start position:0%
masking someday we cannot know when
 
01:43:29.310 --> 01:43:29.320 align:start position:0%
Lydia and students like her will need
 
01:43:31.750 --> 01:43:31.760 align:start position:0%
our reasonable decision making to
 
01:43:33.709 --> 01:43:33.719 align:start position:0%
participate in the education that all
 
01:43:37.149 --> 01:43:37.159 align:start position:0%

01:43:40.310 --> 01:43:40.320 align:start position:0%
step too far we need to have flexibility
 
01:43:41.510 --> 01:43:41.520 align:start position:0%
for different
 
01:43:43.750 --> 01:43:43.760 align:start position:0%
circumstances we need to continue to
 
01:43:46.070 --> 01:43:46.080 align:start position:0%
allow our local elected School boards
 
01:43:47.910 --> 01:43:47.920 align:start position:0%
the freedom to respond to health

the pandemic behind us and never need to

mask again yet we should maintain

Speaker as a Public School parent during
 
01:44:24.189 --> 01:44:24.199 align:start position:0%
covid I remember all too well what it
 
01:44:27.830 --> 01:44:27.840 align:start position:0%
was like for our kids it was a time we
 
01:44:30.990 --> 01:44:31.000 align:start position:0%
would like to leave in the past but not
 
01:44:33.629 --> 01:44:33.639 align:start position:0%
before taking preventative measures for

before taking preventative measures for
the

01:44:34.350 --> 01:44:34.360 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:44:37.270 --> 01:44:37.280 align:start position:0%
future school Mass mandates had a
 
01:44:40.229 --> 01:44:40.239 align:start position:0%
negative impact on our children and did
 
01:44:42.830 --> 01:44:42.840 align:start position:0%
not promote an environment that is
 
01:44:46.270 --> 01:44:46.280 align:start position:0%
conducive to learning in a Harvard poll
 
01:44:50.310 --> 01:44:50.320 align:start position:0%
conducted in March of 22 46% of parents
 
01:44:53.189 --> 01:44:53.199 align:start position:0%
said maske wearing hurt their child so
 
01:44:57.030 --> 01:44:57.040 align:start position:0%
social learning and interactions 39%
 
01:44:59.350 --> 01:44:59.360 align:start position:0%
said it affected their child's mental
 
01:45:03.109 --> 01:45:03.119 align:start position:0%
and emotional health this is consistent
 
01:45:05.390 --> 01:45:05.400 align:start position:0%
with testimony that we received in
 
01:45:07.149 --> 01:45:07.159 align:start position:0%
person and
 
01:45:10.950 --> 01:45:10.960 align:start position:0%
online a heavy burden was placed on
 
01:45:14.629 --> 01:45:14.639 align:start position:0%
children to protect adults they were
 
01:45:17.510 --> 01:45:17.520 align:start position:0%
treated as if they and those around them
 
01:45:21.350 --> 01:45:21.360 align:start position:0%
were perpetually sick creating a climate
 
01:45:25.470 --> 01:45:25.480 align:start position:0%
of fear students were repeatedly told
 
01:45:27.669 --> 01:45:27.679 align:start position:0%
that they would get their family members
 
01:45:31.310 --> 01:45:31.320 align:start position:0%
sick if they didn't keep their masks up
 
01:45:33.950 --> 01:45:33.960 align:start position:0%
they had to wear a mask for hours a day
 
01:45:38.149 --> 01:45:38.159 align:start position:0%
in school on the bus during gym class at
 
01:45:43.629 --> 01:45:43.639 align:start position:0%
recess outdoors and even while playing
 
01:45:47.109 --> 01:45:47.119 align:start position:0%
instruments students with autism anxiety
 
01:45:49.709 --> 01:45:49.719 align:start position:0%
asthma or learning disabilities were not
 
01:45:52.030 --> 01:45:52.040 align:start position:0%
able to get exemptions from these
 
01:45:52.040 --> 01:45:53.790 align:start position:0%
able to get exemptions from these
mandates

01:45:53.790 --> 01:45:53.800 align:start position:0%
mandates
 
01:45:55.870 --> 01:45:55.880 align:start position:0%
however under the governor's mask
 
01:45:58.830 --> 01:45:58.840 align:start position:0%
mandate they would have been Exempted
 
01:46:01.990 --> 01:46:02.000 align:start position:0%
his mask mandate Exempted K through2
 
01:46:04.430 --> 01:46:04.440 align:start position:0%
students teachers and
 
01:46:08.070 --> 01:46:08.080 align:start position:0%
staff School mask mandates originated
 
01:46:09.390 --> 01:46:09.400 align:start position:0%
with school
 
01:46:12.430 --> 01:46:12.440 align:start position:0%
boards finally in February of 22 the
 
01:46:14.310 --> 01:46:14.320 align:start position:0%
governor said that schools would no
 
01:46:16.870 --> 01:46:16.880 align:start position:0%
longer be able to mandate masks and
 
01:46:19.669 --> 01:46:19.679 align:start position:0%
those that continued their mandates
 
01:46:23.510 --> 01:46:23.520 align:start position:0%
would be in violation of Ed 306 rules
 
01:46:25.709 --> 01:46:25.719 align:start position:0%
some had already dropped their mandates
 
01:46:27.830 --> 01:46:27.840 align:start position:0%
by then but many had
 
01:46:30.750 --> 01:46:30.760 align:start position:0%
not teachers and administrators also
 
01:46:33.830 --> 01:46:33.840 align:start position:0%
grew weary of the Mask mandates in an
 
01:46:35.550 --> 01:46:35.560 align:start position:0%
article at that time a local
 
01:46:38.709 --> 01:46:38.719 align:start position:0%
superintendent said as administrators
 
01:46:41.669 --> 01:46:41.679 align:start position:0%
and teachers were tired of asking kids
 
01:46:44.270 --> 01:46:44.280 align:start position:0%
to continue pulling up their masks and
 
01:46:47.709 --> 01:46:47.719 align:start position:0%
explain to them why it's just kind of a
 
01:46:50.270 --> 01:46:50.280 align:start position:0%
mass fatigue if you will on the part of
 
01:46:52.550 --> 01:46:52.560 align:start position:0%
the wearers and the people that have to
 
01:46:55.229 --> 01:46:55.239 align:start position:0%
enforce the
 
01:46:58.189 --> 01:46:58.199 align:start position:0%
wearing the opposition to this bill is
 
01:47:00.589 --> 01:47:00.599 align:start position:0%
concerning because it means there is a
 
01:47:03.550 --> 01:47:03.560 align:start position:0%
potential for this to happen again if
 
01:47:05.510 --> 01:47:05.520 align:start position:0%
there's some Public Health crisis in the
 
01:47:07.310 --> 01:47:07.320 align:start position:0%
future then mandates will need to come
 
01:47:09.830 --> 01:47:09.840 align:start position:0%
from the state because school boards are
 
01:47:13.629 --> 01:47:13.639 align:start position:0%
not qualified to make these types of
 
01:47:17.629 --> 01:47:17.639 align:start position:0%
decisions this bill does not ban masks
 
01:47:20.430 --> 01:47:20.440 align:start position:0%
it simply leaves it up to the most local
 
01:47:24.109 --> 01:47:24.119 align:start position:0%
decision makers the families and their
 
01:47:27.229 --> 01:47:27.239 align:start position:0%

to predict what health emergencies might
 
01:50:08.270 --> 01:50:08.280 align:start position:0%

following State
 
01:50:23.030 --> 01:50:23.040 align:start position:0%

Speaker if I know that some Reasonable
 
01:50:50.229 --> 01:50:50.239 align:start position:0%
Doubt exists regarding the overall
 
01:50:53.430 --> 01:50:53.440 align:start position:0%
effectiveness of wearing face masks
 
01:50:55.350 --> 01:50:55.360 align:start position:0%
as expressed in numerous medical journal

articles and by a growing number of
 
01:51:00.149 --> 01:51:00.159 align:start position:0%
medical experts if I know that face
 
01:51:03.470 --> 01:51:03.480 align:start position:0%
masks have been proven by widespread
 
01:51:05.910 --> 01:51:05.920 align:start position:0%
anecdotal evidence to have harmed
 
01:51:09.149 --> 01:51:09.159 align:start position:0%
children emotionally and physically and
 
01:51:11.830 --> 01:51:11.840 align:start position:0%
to have hindered their education during
 
01:51:15.030 --> 01:51:15.040 align:start position:0%
the covid pandemic if I believe that
 
01:51:18.470 --> 01:51:18.480 align:start position:0%
local school board members are not
 
01:51:21.589 --> 01:51:21.599 align:start position:0%
MediCal experts and should not be

arbitrarily man mandating the wearing of
 
01:51:27.109 --> 01:51:27.119 align:start position:0%
face masks would I now protect school
 
01:51:29.589 --> 01:51:29.599 align:start position:0%

guarantee more posi academic outcomes
 
01:54:56.589 --> 01:54:56.599 align:start position:0%
this bill will not have any effect or
 
01:54:59.430 --> 01:54:59.440 align:start position:0%
impact on lowering budgets and it's not
 
01:55:01.790 --> 01:55:01.800 align:start position:0%
even a reasonable or common sense bill
 
01:55:05.149 --> 01:55:05.159 align:start position:0%
it would be impossible to carry

out please vote no on OTP so that
 
01:55:11.910 --> 01:55:11.920 align:start position:0%

01:55:23.350 --> 01:55:23.360 align:start position:0%
belger thank you Mr Speaker good morning
 
01:55:25.069 --> 01:55:25.079 align:start position:0%
so let me explain to you what this Bild
 
01:55:27.629 --> 01:55:27.639 align:start position:0%
does with a quick analogy if we look at
 
01:55:29.229 --> 01:55:29.239 align:start position:0%
the field of healthcare and we want to
 
01:55:31.149 --> 01:55:31.159 align:start position:0%
learn something about whether or not
 
01:55:33.310 --> 01:55:33.320 align:start position:0%
blood pressure medication is working to
 
01:55:35.870 --> 01:55:35.880 align:start position:0%
reduce blood pressure we would run a
 
01:55:37.470 --> 01:55:37.480 align:start position:0%
scientific study and we would want to
 
01:55:40.030 --> 01:55:40.040 align:start position:0%
look for information like did it lower
 
01:55:42.830 --> 01:55:42.840 align:start position:0%
blood pressure how much did it lower
 
01:55:45.990 --> 01:55:46.000 align:start position:0%
blood pressure and were their side
 
01:55:48.189 --> 01:55:48.199 align:start position:0%
effects but what if I said we could do
 
01:55:50.669 --> 01:55:50.679 align:start position:0%
this a different way and simply just ask
 
01:55:54.350 --> 01:55:54.360 align:start position:0%
the doctors do you feel like this is
 
01:55:56.990 --> 01:55:57.000 align:start position:0%
working those are two pieces of evidence
 
01:55:59.709 --> 01:55:59.719 align:start position:0%
but they are not equal in what they are
 
01:56:02.510 --> 01:56:02.520 align:start position:0%
demonstrating to you there's no reason
 
01:56:04.189 --> 01:56:04.199 align:start position:0%
that we shouldn't be doing what everyone
 
01:56:06.390 --> 01:56:06.400 align:start position:0%
else is doing in in Pharmaceuticals and
 
01:56:09.270 --> 01:56:09.280 align:start position:0%
elsewhere in education by relying on
 
01:56:13.030 --> 01:56:13.040 align:start position:0%
good objective data and the scientific
 
01:56:14.830 --> 01:56:14.840 align:start position:0%
method as far as doing scientific
 
01:56:17.189 --> 01:56:17.199 align:start position:0%
research we have colleges all over this
 
01:56:18.990 --> 01:56:19.000 align:start position:0%
country doing scientific research on
 
01:56:21.229 --> 01:56:21.239 align:start position:0%
these methods every day we should be
 
01:56:25.109 --> 01:56:25.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:27.910 --> 01:56:27.920 align:start position:0%
yet currently so much of what is done in
 
01:56:30.350 --> 01:56:30.360 align:start position:0%
Education is relying on surveys they
 
01:56:32.030 --> 01:56:32.040 align:start position:0%
simply send out this and they ask
 
01:56:33.750 --> 01:56:33.760 align:start position:0%
questions about how people think things
 
01:56:36.109 --> 01:56:36.119 align:start position:0%
are going or how they feel things are
 
01:56:39.510 --> 01:56:39.520 align:start position:0%
going that's not good enough evidence if
 
01:56:41.910 --> 01:56:41.920 align:start position:0%
we pass this bill what we will do is we
 
01:56:44.950 --> 01:56:44.960 align:start position:0%
will require them to align it with only
 
01:56:44.960 --> 01:56:46.750 align:start position:0%
will require them to align it with only
objective

01:56:46.750 --> 01:56:46.760 align:start position:0%
objective
 
01:56:49.870 --> 01:56:49.880 align:start position:0%
data by aligning it with objective data
 
01:56:52.790 --> 01:56:52.800 align:start position:0%
and good science what we will do is we
 
01:56:55.589 --> 01:56:55.599 align:start position:0%
will improve outcomes while
 
01:56:58.069 --> 01:56:58.079 align:start position:0%
simultaneously reducing costs because
 
01:57:00.149 --> 01:57:00.159 align:start position:0%
over time we're going to stop chasing so
 
01:57:03.870 --> 01:57:03.880 align:start position:0%
many fads and settle on what
 
01:57:06.270 --> 01:57:06.280 align:start position:0%
works please support this please press

inquiry thank you Mr Speaker if I know
 
01:58:39.870 --> 01:58:39.880 align:start position:0%
this bill is modeled on a national bill
 
01:58:42.189 --> 01:58:42.199 align:start position:0%
that started in another state and is
 
01:58:44.390 --> 01:58:44.400 align:start position:0%
latest effort to inject religion and
 
01:58:46.870 --> 01:58:46.880 align:start position:0%
unscientific Views into the science
 
01:58:49.310 --> 01:58:49.320 align:start position:0%
classroom and if I KN know it will
 
01:58:51.270 --> 01:58:51.280 align:start position:0%
unleash an assault against scientific
 
01:58:53.709 --> 01:58:53.719 align:start position:0%
integrity leaving students confused and
 
01:58:56.030 --> 01:58:56.040 align:start position:0%

students perform among the best in the

country and Mr Speaker if I know the
 
01:59:05.669 --> 01:59:05.679 align:start position:0%
Moon is not made of cheese then would I
 
01:59:08.310 --> 01:59:08.320 align:start position:0%

01:59:10.270 --> 01:59:10.280 align:start position:0%

01:59:12.550 --> 01:59:12.560 align:start position:0%

inquiry thank you Mr Speaker if I
 
01:59:22.189 --> 01:59:22.199 align:start position:0%
believe that words should mean what they
 
01:59:24.350 --> 01:59:24.360 align:start position:0%
say they mean and if I know that
 
01:59:27.510 --> 01:59:27.520 align:start position:0%
accurately defining reliable data as
 
01:59:29.790 --> 01:59:29.800 align:start position:0%
evidence-base does not prohibit
 
01:59:32.390 --> 01:59:32.400 align:start position:0%
self-reported data from being used but
 
01:59:34.950 --> 01:59:34.960 align:start position:0%
it simply must be labeled as such and
 
01:59:37.790 --> 01:59:37.800 align:start position:0%
finally if I know that teachers students
 
01:59:40.069 --> 01:59:40.079 align:start position:0%

when a school board seat is vacated the
 
02:25:12.389 --> 02:25:12.399 align:start position:0%
successor must be appointed from the

same municipality as the outgoing member

approval finding any qualified volunteer
 
02:25:33.230 --> 02:25:33.240 align:start position:0%
to fill Schoolboard seats as we know is
 
02:25:35.910 --> 02:25:35.920 align:start position:0%
often difficult and time
 
02:25:39.150 --> 02:25:39.160 align:start position:0%
consuming 1481 makes it harder to fill a
 
02:25:41.510 --> 02:25:41.520 align:start position:0%
vacant seat by taking a local
 
02:25:44.269 --> 02:25:44.279 align:start position:0%
Cooperative schools procedure that has
 
02:25:47.309 --> 02:25:47.319 align:start position:0%
been working in place for this situation
 
02:25:49.429 --> 02:25:49.439 align:start position:0%
and makes it more restrictive and
 
02:25:52.910 --> 02:25:52.920 align:start position:0%
complex this can result in a vacant seat
 
02:25:55.030 --> 02:25:55.040 align:start position:0%
that could remain empty for a
 
02:25:58.590 --> 02:25:58.600 align:start position:0%
considerable time long-term vacancies on
 
02:26:01.190 --> 02:26:01.200 align:start position:0%
school boards could affect the unique
 
02:26:03.510 --> 02:26:03.520 align:start position:0%
circumstances each Cooperative School
 
02:26:06.670 --> 02:26:06.680 align:start position:0%

Cooperative school districts should not
 
02:26:14.190 --> 02:26:14.200 align:start position:0%
be addressed as we've seen with peac

Solutions but instead should be
 
02:26:22.910 --> 02:26:22.920 align:start position:0%
addressed with a study committee to
 
02:26:25.389 --> 02:26:25.399 align:start position:0%

02:26:40.790 --> 02:26:40.800 align:start position:0%
you representative D recognized to speak

02:26:52.070 --> 02:26:52.080 align:start position:0%
motion thank you Mr Speaker good morning
 
02:26:53.630 --> 02:26:53.640 align:start position:0%
as you just heard the number and the
 
02:26:56.309 --> 02:26:56.319 align:start position:0%
composition the method of selection the
 
02:26:58.349 --> 02:26:58.359 align:start position:0%
terms of the members of uh Cooperative
 
02:27:00.710 --> 02:27:00.720 align:start position:0%
school boards are all provided by the
 
02:27:02.990 --> 02:27:03.000 align:start position:0%
bylaws and the area agreements or the
 
02:27:04.550 --> 02:27:04.560 align:start position:0%
articles of agreements that Cooperative
 
02:27:04.560 --> 02:27:07.269 align:start position:0%
articles of agreements that Cooperative
districts

02:27:07.269 --> 02:27:07.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:10.910 --> 02:27:10.920 align:start position:0%
have they vary from District to District
 
02:27:12.269 --> 02:27:12.279 align:start position:0%
but just because towns are in a
 
02:27:13.710 --> 02:27:13.720 align:start position:0%
Cooperative doesn't mean that they're
 
02:27:16.910 --> 02:27:16.920 align:start position:0%
the same size so when a vacancy occurs
 
02:27:18.790 --> 02:27:18.800 align:start position:0%
in any Cooperative board seat that's
 
02:27:21.790 --> 02:27:21.800 align:start position:0%
elected at Large it's important to
 
02:27:24.710 --> 02:27:24.720 align:start position:0%
maintain any balance of town or
 
02:27:27.429 --> 02:27:27.439 align:start position:0%
municipality representation that might
 
02:27:28.790 --> 02:27:28.800 align:start position:0%
exist on the
 
02:27:32.670 --> 02:27:32.680 align:start position:0%
board the easiest way to do this is to
 
02:27:35.790 --> 02:27:35.800 align:start position:0%
have the vacancy filled by a successor
 
02:27:38.830 --> 02:27:38.840 align:start position:0%
who is from the same municipality as the
 
02:27:42.030 --> 02:27:42.040 align:start position:0%
outgoing member this bill establishes
 
02:27:44.950 --> 02:27:44.960 align:start position:0%
that requirement and I urge its passage
 
02:27:48.469 --> 02:27:48.479 align:start position:0%

02:27:50.870 --> 02:27:50.880 align:start position:0%

school districts each have existing
 
02:29:24.230 --> 02:29:24.240 align:start position:0%
articles of agreement and if I believe
 
02:29:26.230 --> 02:29:26.240 align:start position:0%
that this bill would interfere with

02:38:33.990 --> 02:38:34.000 align:start position:0%
increases the cost to your local school

services we think in this majority
 
02:40:03.110 --> 02:40:03.120 align:start position:0%
opinion that for every new service that
 
02:40:05.910 --> 02:40:05.920 align:start position:0%
is being buil the parent should have
 
02:40:09.190 --> 02:40:09.200 align:start position:0%
written consent for that as well this is
 
02:40:12.030 --> 02:40:12.040 align:start position:0%

02:40:17.590 --> 02:40:17.600 align:start position:0%
being provided to their children and
 
02:40:19.870 --> 02:40:19.880 align:start position:0%
have the right to consent before that
 
02:40:22.670 --> 02:40:22.680 align:start position:0%
new service is being build and schools
 
02:40:25.550 --> 02:40:25.560 align:start position:0%
are getting money for that
 
02:40:28.630 --> 02:40:28.640 align:start position:0%
service please vote for parents and
 
02:40:33.150 --> 02:40:33.160 align:start position:0%

02:41:42.309 --> 02:41:42.319 align:start position:0%
questions on the motion of ought to pass
 
02:41:44.870 --> 02:41:44.880 align:start position:0%
as amended on House Bill 1616 and this
 
02:41:47.230 --> 02:41:47.240 align:start position:0%
is a division vote representative Hall
 
02:41:54.269 --> 02:41:54.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:57.110 --> 02:41:57.120 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker if I know that this bill
 
02:41:59.110 --> 02:41:59.120 align:start position:0%
would require parents to provide an
 
02:42:01.309 --> 02:42:01.319 align:start position:0%
additional consent for Medicaid billing
 
02:42:03.389 --> 02:42:03.399 align:start position:0%
for new service even though they had
 
02:42:05.150 --> 02:42:05.160 align:start position:0%
already agreed to that service change
 
02:42:08.750 --> 02:42:08.760 align:start position:0%
during the IEP review process and if I
 
02:42:10.590 --> 02:42:10.600 align:start position:0%
know that this bill would result in
 
02:42:13.030 --> 02:42:13.040 align:start position:0%
unnecessary paperwork and related costs
 
02:42:15.429 --> 02:42:15.439 align:start position:0%
to administrative services and possibly
 
02:42:18.389 --> 02:42:18.399 align:start position:0%
to local districts as well and finally
 
02:42:20.389 --> 02:42:20.399 align:start position:0%
if I know that a vote to interim study
 
02:42:23.309 --> 02:42:23.319 align:start position:0%
this bill would allow DHHS to look at
 
02:42:25.309 --> 02:42:25.319 align:start position:0%
this program as well as other Medicaid
 
02:42:27.710 --> 02:42:27.720 align:start position:0%
programs as a whole to better understand
 
02:42:30.110 --> 02:42:30.120 align:start position:0%
concerns that need to be addressed would
 
02:42:31.830 --> 02:42:31.840 align:start position:0%
I now press the red button so that
 
02:42:35.309 --> 02:42:35.319 align:start position:0%

provided question build services or
 
02:42:55.830 --> 02:42:55.840 align:start position:0%
require correction if the billing is not
 
02:42:58.110 --> 02:42:58.120 align:start position:0%
accurate and if I believe parental
 
02:43:00.950 --> 02:43:00.960 align:start position:0%
consent and approval is necessary and
 
02:43:02.710 --> 02:43:02.720 align:start position:0%
adds on an additional layer of
 
02:43:05.389 --> 02:43:05.399 align:start position:0%
protections for both taxpayers and the
 
02:43:07.950 --> 02:43:07.960 align:start position:0%

authority to impose disciplinary action
 
02:46:34.349 --> 02:46:34.359 align:start position:0%
particularly an agency as important as a
 
02:46:36.910 --> 02:46:36.920 align:start position:0%
Department of Education to not have the
 
02:46:39.910 --> 02:46:39.920 align:start position:0%

tremendous amount of time uh right

before lunch on this so I'll keep it
 
03:10:16.429 --> 03:10:16.439 align:start position:0%
really simple uh there are speakers
 
03:10:18.269 --> 03:10:18.279 align:start position:0%
behind me that will speak to the merits
 
03:10:20.550 --> 03:10:20.560 align:start position:0%
of the bill itself um but from the
 
03:10:21.790 --> 03:10:21.800 align:start position:0%
previous vote that you just saw the
 
03:10:23.190 --> 03:10:23.200 align:start position:0%
likelihood of this bill making it
 
03:10:25.670 --> 03:10:25.680 align:start position:0%
through this chamber is fairly decent um
 
03:10:29.510 --> 03:10:29.520 align:start position:0%
so I would submit to you um this floor
 
03:10:31.349 --> 03:10:31.359 align:start position:0%
Amendment which basically just says that
 
03:10:34.950 --> 03:10:34.960 align:start position:0%
um the state and the landfill owner um
 
03:10:36.590 --> 03:10:36.600 align:start position:0%
have to come to an agreement there needs
 
03:10:38.389 --> 03:10:38.399 align:start position:0%
to be some conversation on that and some
 
03:10:40.429 --> 03:10:40.439 align:start position:0%
agreement on what happens uh if the
 
03:10:43.269 --> 03:10:43.279 align:start position:0%
landfill leaks uh due to NE negligence
 
03:10:45.790 --> 03:10:45.800 align:start position:0%
or mistakes uh it is a reasonable
 
03:10:46.910 --> 03:10:46.920 align:start position:0%
addition to the bill I think it's a
 
03:10:49.389 --> 03:10:49.399 align:start position:0%
protection for the state uh taxpayers um
 
03:10:51.790 --> 03:10:51.800 align:start position:0%
so I hope that you will um vote with me
 
03:10:53.469 --> 03:10:53.479 align:start position:0%

03:15:16.309 --> 03:15:16.319 align:start position:0%
of a to pass with Amendment
 
03:15:18.349 --> 03:15:18.359 align:start position:0%
representative Aon is recognized speak
 
03:15:32.710 --> 03:15:32.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:35.429 --> 03:15:35.439 align:start position:0%
motion thank you Mr
 
03:15:38.269 --> 03:15:38.279 align:start position:0%
Speaker Mr Speaker and colleagues the
 
03:15:40.950 --> 03:15:40.960 align:start position:0%
premise of this bill is to ban private
 
03:15:43.510 --> 03:15:43.520 align:start position:0%
ownership of landfills in New Hampshire
 
03:15:46.150 --> 03:15:46.160 align:start position:0%
in order to get around the US Commerce
 
03:15:48.990 --> 03:15:49.000 align:start position:0%
Clause and allow us to limit or even
 
03:15:52.469 --> 03:15:52.479 align:start position:0%
eliminate the importation of outof State
 
03:15:55.389 --> 03:15:55.399 align:start position:0%
trash it grandfathers in existing
 
03:15:58.510 --> 03:15:58.520 align:start position:0%
landfills so there will be no impact at
 
03:16:01.229 --> 03:16:01.239 align:start position:0%
all to what we already do at those
 
03:16:04.550 --> 03:16:04.560 align:start position:0%
facilities anyway four of the six
 
03:16:06.990 --> 03:16:07.000 align:start position:0%
landfills in the state are publicly
 
03:16:10.229 --> 03:16:10.239 align:start position:0%
owned almost 50% of those landfills
 
03:16:13.349 --> 03:16:13.359 align:start position:0%
landfill trash is from out of
 
03:16:17.309 --> 03:16:17.319 align:start position:0%
state we only have one new landfill
 
03:16:19.870 --> 03:16:19.880 align:start position:0%
permit currently being considered at the
 
03:16:21.630 --> 03:16:21.640 align:start position:0%
State Department of Environmental
 
03:16:24.229 --> 03:16:24.239 align:start position:0%
Services and it appears this bill just
 
03:16:27.150 --> 03:16:27.160 align:start position:0%
seeks to shut that down it's not even
 
03:16:28.990 --> 03:16:29.000 align:start position:0%
clear what would happen to that
 
03:16:32.150 --> 03:16:32.160 align:start position:0%
permitting process if this bill were to
 
03:16:35.030 --> 03:16:35.040 align:start position:0%
pass in terms of landfill capacity and
 
03:16:37.990 --> 03:16:38.000 align:start position:0%
need we will likely only need one new
 
03:16:42.070 --> 03:16:42.080 align:start position:0%
landfill for the next 25 to 50 years
 
03:16:43.990 --> 03:16:44.000 align:start position:0%
especially as we have goals to reduce
 
03:16:46.670 --> 03:16:46.680 align:start position:0%
what we place in landfills landfilling
 
03:16:46.680 --> 03:16:47.590 align:start position:0%
what we place in landfills landfilling
also

03:16:47.590 --> 03:16:47.600 align:start position:0%
also
 
03:16:50.269 --> 03:16:50.279 align:start position:0%
is our last resort in handling Solid
 
03:16:53.110 --> 03:16:53.120 align:start position:0%
Waste according to our state Solid Waste
 
03:16:53.120 --> 03:16:55.389 align:start position:0%
Waste according to our state Solid Waste
Management

03:16:55.389 --> 03:16:55.399 align:start position:0%
Management
 
03:16:58.150 --> 03:16:58.160 align:start position:0%
plan nine members of my committee
 
03:16:59.910 --> 03:16:59.920 align:start position:0%
strongly believe that banning private
 
03:17:01.950 --> 03:17:01.960 align:start position:0%
ownership of landfills in New Hampshire
 
03:17:03.710 --> 03:17:03.720 align:start position:0%
in order to control the amount of out
 
03:17:03.720 --> 03:17:04.710 align:start position:0%
in order to control the amount of out
estate

03:17:04.710 --> 03:17:04.720 align:start position:0%
estate
 
03:17:08.469 --> 03:17:08.479 align:start position:0%
trash being placed into our landfills is
 
03:17:11.189 --> 03:17:11.199 align:start position:0%
wrong our state and counties and
 
03:17:14.030 --> 03:17:14.040 align:start position:0%
municipalities already have the ability
 
03:17:16.590 --> 03:17:16.600 align:start position:0%
to establish landfills in our state and
 
03:17:19.309 --> 03:17:19.319 align:start position:0%
have done so successfully in several
 
03:17:21.630 --> 03:17:21.640 align:start position:0%
places and they currently compete
 
03:17:24.510 --> 03:17:24.520 align:start position:0%
alongside privately owned landfills
 
03:17:27.229 --> 03:17:27.239 align:start position:0%
these entities can already set up step
 
03:17:30.389 --> 03:17:30.399 align:start position:0%
up and propose establishing a landfill
 
03:17:31.710 --> 03:17:31.720 align:start position:0%
to fulfill a
 
03:17:34.349 --> 03:17:34.359 align:start position:0%
need Banning the private ownership of
 
03:17:37.790 --> 03:17:37.800 align:start position:0%
landfills is just not business friendly
 
03:17:40.510 --> 03:17:40.520 align:start position:0%
even if a private business enters into a
 
03:17:42.550 --> 03:17:42.560 align:start position:0%
contract with the state county or
 
03:17:45.510 --> 03:17:45.520 align:start position:0%
municipality to operate a publicly owned
 
03:17:49.110 --> 03:17:49.120 align:start position:0%
landfill but not own the land why would
 
03:17:52.229 --> 03:17:52.239 align:start position:0%
a contractor want to invest millions of
 
03:17:55.030 --> 03:17:55.040 align:start position:0%
dollars in infrastructure on a site that
 
03:17:57.750 --> 03:17:57.760 align:start position:0%
they would eventually abandon or worse
 
03:18:00.189 --> 03:18:00.199 align:start position:0%
if their contract is not renewed by the
 
03:18:02.590 --> 03:18:02.600 align:start position:0%
public entity they'd have to leave it
 
03:18:05.229 --> 03:18:05.239 align:start position:0%
behind they'd have to hand over all that
 
03:18:07.469 --> 03:18:07.479 align:start position:0%
infrastructure to another contractor who
 
03:18:10.150 --> 03:18:10.160 align:start position:0%
would then run this landfill the
 
03:18:12.550 --> 03:18:12.560 align:start position:0%
contractor could also possibly walk away
 
03:18:15.309 --> 03:18:15.319 align:start position:0%
from a future environmental disaster
 
03:18:17.110 --> 03:18:17.120 align:start position:0%
leaving the state to hold the bag and
 
03:18:19.630 --> 03:18:19.640 align:start position:0%
clean up the mess the devil certainly
 
03:18:21.790 --> 03:18:21.800 align:start position:0%
would be in the details of the
 
03:18:24.389 --> 03:18:24.399 align:start position:0%
contract there are many other questions
 
03:18:26.269 --> 03:18:26.279 align:start position:0%
regarding state county and Municipal
 
03:18:28.750 --> 03:18:28.760 align:start position:0%
ownership of landfills such as would the
 
03:18:31.309 --> 03:18:31.319 align:start position:0%
government entity likely take land via
 
03:18:34.469 --> 03:18:34.479 align:start position:0%
eminent domain to establish a landfill
 
03:18:36.150 --> 03:18:36.160 align:start position:0%
who would have the liability for the
 
03:18:38.590 --> 03:18:38.600 align:start position:0%
land if the land became contaminated or
 
03:18:41.830 --> 03:18:41.840 align:start position:0%
becomes an environmental problem should
 
03:18:44.150 --> 03:18:44.160 align:start position:0%
these costs along with operational costs
 
03:18:47.150 --> 03:18:47.160 align:start position:0%
be borne by New Hampshire taxpayers and
 
03:18:48.910 --> 03:18:48.920 align:start position:0%
what about the increase in costs and
 
03:18:51.670 --> 03:18:51.680 align:start position:0%
tipping fees that are likely to occur
 
03:18:53.870 --> 03:18:53.880 align:start position:0%
this would surely impact New Hampshire
 
03:18:56.309 --> 03:18:56.319 align:start position:0%
taxpayers and we don't believe that this
 
03:18:58.950 --> 03:18:58.960 align:start position:0%
is the right solution as it creates many
 
03:19:01.590 --> 03:19:01.600 align:start position:0%
more problems and increases the costs to
 
03:19:03.189 --> 03:19:03.199 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
03:19:06.309 --> 03:19:06.319 align:start position:0%
taxpayers considering that we already
 
03:19:08.269 --> 03:19:08.279 align:start position:0%
have a bill that was passed
 
03:19:10.710 --> 03:19:10.720 align:start position:0%
unanimously by our committee that caps
 
03:19:13.630 --> 03:19:13.640 align:start position:0%
out State trash out of state trash by
 
03:19:16.510 --> 03:19:16.520 align:start position:0%
15% in accordance with the US Commerce
 
03:19:16.520 --> 03:20:20.189 align:start position:0%
15% in accordance with the US Commerce
Clause

03:20:20.189 --> 03:20:20.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:22.269 --> 03:20:22.279 align:start position:0%
so I'm pretty much going to speak to the
 
03:20:26.950 --> 03:20:26.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:31.229 --> 03:20:31.239 align:start position:0%
HBS oh thank you Mr Speaker sorry um I
 
03:20:32.950 --> 03:20:32.960 align:start position:0%
going to speak to the Republican
 
03:20:35.590 --> 03:20:35.600 align:start position:0%
inconsistencies into HB
 
03:20:38.950 --> 03:20:38.960 align:start position:0%
1145 so a republican talking point that
 
03:20:41.349 --> 03:20:41.359 align:start position:0%
is we can't stifle private businesses
 
03:20:44.590 --> 03:20:44.600 align:start position:0%
right so I would like to remind y'all
 
03:20:46.189 --> 03:20:46.199 align:start position:0%
when we were talking about passing the
 
03:20:48.229 --> 03:20:48.239 align:start position:0%
bill to ban China from moaning land in
 
03:20:51.150 --> 03:20:51.160 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and I supported that so
 
03:20:53.510 --> 03:20:53.520 align:start position:0%
let's say a brand new Beijing based
 
03:20:55.150 --> 03:20:55.160 align:start position:0%
state-of-the-art Solid Waste Company
 
03:20:57.349 --> 03:20:57.359 align:start position:0%
comes into New Hampshire buys up all the
 
03:20:59.269 --> 03:20:59.279 align:start position:0%
available property then they
 
03:21:01.750 --> 03:21:01.760 align:start position:0%
simultaneously put in 10 applications to
 
03:21:04.150 --> 03:21:04.160 align:start position:0%
build massive landfills that have 30
 
03:21:06.510 --> 03:21:06.520 align:start position:0%
plusy year life in New Hampshire right
 
03:21:09.070 --> 03:21:09.080 align:start position:0%
now there is nothing stopping them from
 
03:21:12.510 --> 03:21:12.520 align:start position:0%
doing so because Dees only reviews
 
03:21:15.389 --> 03:21:15.399 align:start position:0%
applications and approves based upon
 
03:21:19.550 --> 03:21:19.560 align:start position:0%
rules not need last year Dees told a
 
03:21:21.990 --> 03:21:22.000 align:start position:0%
group of legislators I was there and
 
03:21:23.590 --> 03:21:23.600 align:start position:0%
concerned New Hampshire citizens in a
 
03:21:26.309 --> 03:21:26.319 align:start position:0%
meeting their job is to get the permit
 
03:21:29.150 --> 03:21:29.160 align:start position:0%
applications to a yes that was
 
03:21:31.950 --> 03:21:31.960 align:start position:0%
concerning for us all to hear Let remind
 
03:21:34.389 --> 03:21:34.399 align:start position:0%
this body that even after St gobain
 
03:21:36.150 --> 03:21:36.160 align:start position:0%
polluted the drinking water for an
 
03:21:38.830 --> 03:21:38.840 align:start position:0%
entire region in southern New Hampshire
 
03:21:42.070 --> 03:21:42.080 align:start position:0%
Dees approved another permit before the
 
03:21:45.189 --> 03:21:45.199 align:start position:0%
company decided to close up shop that
 
03:21:48.269 --> 03:21:48.279 align:start position:0%
made us all pretty upset
 
03:21:50.910 --> 03:21:50.920 align:start position:0%
especially the folks that living in
 
03:21:54.389 --> 03:21:54.399 align:start position:0%
marac so we were told that it was
 
03:21:56.550 --> 03:21:56.560 align:start position:0%
approved because they can't look at
 
03:21:59.030 --> 03:21:59.040 align:start position:0%
unrelated items outside of the
 
03:22:00.710 --> 03:22:00.720 align:start position:0%
application that is staring right in
 
03:22:03.510 --> 03:22:03.520 align:start position:0%
front of them our landfill pering rules
 
03:22:06.150 --> 03:22:06.160 align:start position:0%
are weak and the new rules in this
 
03:22:07.990 --> 03:22:08.000 align:start position:0%
process that they're undertaking are
 
03:22:09.870 --> 03:22:09.880 align:start position:0%
looking to be some of the weakest in New
 
03:22:13.070 --> 03:22:13.080 align:start position:0%
England and in the country so because
 
03:22:15.630 --> 03:22:15.640 align:start position:0%
trash is a multi-billion Dollar business
 
03:22:17.750 --> 03:22:17.760 align:start position:0%
and private companies because of federal
 
03:22:20.110 --> 03:22:20.120 align:start position:0%
Clause are using New Hampshire as their
 
03:22:21.990 --> 03:22:22.000 align:start position:0%
Dumping Ground to
 
03:22:23.990 --> 03:22:24.000 align:start position:0%
make to make sure that they will
 
03:22:25.670 --> 03:22:25.680 align:start position:0%
continue to buy property and build
 
03:22:28.550 --> 03:22:28.560 align:start position:0%
landfills based upon their profit not
 
03:22:31.189 --> 03:22:31.199 align:start position:0%
needs of the New Hampshire
 
03:22:33.590 --> 03:22:33.600 align:start position:0%
citizens we all encourage private
 
03:22:35.510 --> 03:22:35.520 align:start position:0%
businesses to build here or come to New
 
03:22:37.750 --> 03:22:37.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to improve our economy our
 
03:22:39.790 --> 03:22:39.800 align:start position:0%
communities and we want them to be good
 
03:22:42.229 --> 03:22:42.239 align:start position:0%
stewards to our environment but this is
 
03:22:44.750 --> 03:22:44.760 align:start position:0%
not a typical business landfills should
 
03:22:47.790 --> 03:22:47.800 align:start position:0%
not be ba built based upon anything else
 
03:22:50.150 --> 03:22:50.160 align:start position:0%
but need do we really want New Hampshire
 
03:22:52.510 --> 03:22:52.520 align:start position:0%
to become the trash State the state is
 
03:22:54.550 --> 03:22:54.560 align:start position:0%
letting private businesses Drive The
 
03:22:57.309 --> 03:22:57.319 align:start position:0%
Trash Bus which is not in the best
 
03:22:59.790 --> 03:22:59.800 align:start position:0%
interest for granite Staters if we do
 
03:23:02.790 --> 03:23:02.800 align:start position:0%
things right with reduction Recycling
 
03:23:04.910 --> 03:23:04.920 align:start position:0%
and new technology to include some
 
03:23:06.349 --> 03:23:06.359 align:start position:0%
amazing amazing things that they're
 
03:23:08.550 --> 03:23:08.560 align:start position:0%
doing with incineration we should only
 
03:23:11.110 --> 03:23:11.120 align:start position:0%
need one landfill in The Next
 
03:23:13.790 --> 03:23:13.800 align:start position:0%
Century this bill enables a public
 
03:23:16.429 --> 03:23:16.439 align:start position:0%
private partnership this the only thing
 
03:23:18.830 --> 03:23:18.840 align:start position:0%
that the the state owns is the land
 
03:23:21.269 --> 03:23:21.279 align:start position:0%
that's it this saves the private company
 
03:23:23.950 --> 03:23:23.960 align:start position:0%
time and money the private company runs
 
03:23:27.030 --> 03:23:27.040 align:start position:0%
everything else the standard practice
 
03:23:28.630 --> 03:23:28.640 align:start position:0%
this is actually the standard practice
 
03:23:30.790 --> 03:23:30.800 align:start position:0%
everywhere in the country besides over
 
03:23:32.950 --> 03:23:32.960 align:start position:0%
50% of the landfills in the entire
 
03:23:36.830 --> 03:23:36.840 align:start position:0%
country are are exclusively uh public
 
03:23:38.590 --> 03:23:38.600 align:start position:0%
and Maine just so you know when we're
 
03:23:40.269 --> 03:23:40.279 align:start position:0%
talking about that landfill that
 
03:23:42.229 --> 03:23:42.239 align:start position:0%
everybody wants to stop that's happening
 
03:23:46.110 --> 03:23:46.120 align:start position:0%
up north actually has um a public
 
03:23:47.790 --> 03:23:47.800 align:start position:0%
private part partnership with that same
 
03:23:49.830 --> 03:23:49.840 align:start position:0%
company right across the border that is
 
03:23:53.269 --> 03:23:53.279 align:start position:0%
thriving it's a 32 year old 32 year uh
 
03:23:53.279 --> 03:23:54.870 align:start position:0%
thriving it's a 32 year old 32 year uh
32ye

03:23:54.870 --> 03:23:54.880 align:start position:0%
32ye
 
03:23:56.830 --> 03:23:56.840 align:start position:0%
contract these are not private
 
03:23:58.630 --> 03:23:58.640 align:start position:0%
businesses either our private operator
 
03:24:00.110 --> 03:24:00.120 align:start position:0%
landfills are from companies that are
 
03:24:02.150 --> 03:24:02.160 align:start position:0%
headquartered outside of New Hampshire
 
03:24:05.670 --> 03:24:05.680 align:start position:0%
they are in uh Texas and Vermont so to
 
03:24:07.550 --> 03:24:07.560 align:start position:0%
wrap this up this bill enables the state
 
03:24:10.309 --> 03:24:10.319 align:start position:0%
to pick a good site with good soil near
 
03:24:13.349 --> 03:24:13.359 align:start position:0%
the major sources of instate generation
 
03:24:15.070 --> 03:24:15.080 align:start position:0%
rather than being at the mercy of a
 
03:24:18.229 --> 03:24:18.239 align:start position:0%
company in Landover over um
 
03:24:21.830 --> 03:24:21.840 align:start position:0%
owner sorry who don't care about the
 
03:24:23.950 --> 03:24:23.960 align:start position:0%
safety or the truck or their traffic
 
03:24:26.510 --> 03:24:26.520 align:start position:0%
distance and this bill enables us to put
 
03:24:29.429 --> 03:24:29.439 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire taxpayers in our trash
 
03:24:31.950 --> 03:24:31.960 align:start position:0%
first HB
 
03:24:35.150 --> 03:24:35.160 align:start position:0%
1145 also would not require the New
 
03:24:37.429 --> 03:24:37.439 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to reduce the flow of otate
 
03:24:40.990 --> 03:24:41.000 align:start position:0%
trash it merely allows us to be in the
 
03:24:43.910 --> 03:24:43.920 align:start position:0%
driver's seat for us so for example
 
03:24:45.510 --> 03:24:45.520 align:start position:0%
let's say we have a landfill and it's
 
03:24:47.309 --> 03:24:47.319 align:start position:0%
not getting filled the State can make
 
03:24:48.990 --> 03:24:49.000 align:start position:0%
those decisions to increase that
 
03:24:54.710 --> 03:24:54.720 align:start position:0%
percentage at any time so in fact um we
 
03:24:56.429 --> 03:24:56.439 align:start position:0%
could turn on and turn off the flow
 
03:24:59.189 --> 03:24:59.199 align:start position:0%
wholly or partially as we see fit based
 
03:25:01.910 --> 03:25:01.920 align:start position:0%
upon our circumstances so please join me
 
03:25:05.389 --> 03:25:05.399 align:start position:0%
in passing HB 1145 so that we don't make
 
03:25:08.670 --> 03:25:08.680 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire a San Sanctuary state of
 
03:25:11.389 --> 03:25:11.399 align:start position:0%
trash from New England most especially
 
03:25:13.910 --> 03:25:13.920 align:start position:0%
from Massachusetts it's time to put New
 
03:25:15.550 --> 03:25:15.560 align:start position:0%

that HB
 
03:27:18.349 --> 03:27:18.359 align:start position:0%

03:27:19.630 --> 03:27:19.640 align:start position:0%
of private
 
03:27:22.870 --> 03:27:22.880 align:start position:0%
operations if I also know that under
 
03:27:25.630 --> 03:27:25.640 align:start position:0%
current rules the state or
 
03:27:29.030 --> 03:27:29.040 align:start position:0%
municipalities already own four of six
 
03:27:32.469 --> 03:27:32.479 align:start position:0%
landfills and if I also know that to
 
03:27:34.710 --> 03:27:34.720 align:start position:0%
provide safe and effective landfills in
 
03:27:37.910 --> 03:27:37.920 align:start position:0%
the future we should not limit options
 
03:27:41.229 --> 03:27:41.239 align:start position:0%
for establishing ownership would I not
 
03:27:43.309 --> 03:27:43.319 align:start position:0%
press the red button so that another
 
03:27:45.349 --> 03:27:45.359 align:start position:0%

03:27:47.630 --> 03:27:47.640 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr Speaker
 
03:27:49.349 --> 03:27:49.359 align:start position:0%

03:27:54.389 --> 03:27:54.399 align:start position:0%
inquiry thank you Mr Speaker if I know
 
03:27:56.309 --> 03:27:56.319 align:start position:0%
that this body has a long history of
 
03:27:58.910 --> 03:27:58.920 align:start position:0%
supporting clean water and responsible
 
03:28:01.349 --> 03:28:01.359 align:start position:0%
environmental measures and if I know
 
03:28:03.030 --> 03:28:03.040 align:start position:0%
that this proposal establishes a
 
03:28:06.030 --> 03:28:06.040 align:start position:0%
balanced relationship where the private
 
03:28:09.710 --> 03:28:09.720 align:start position:0%
and public entities can work together
 
03:28:12.429 --> 03:28:12.439 align:start position:0%
and if I know that over 50% of landfills
 
03:28:13.790 --> 03:28:13.800 align:start position:0%
in the United States are already
 
03:28:16.510 --> 03:28:16.520 align:start position:0%
publicly owned with some operated by the
 
03:28:18.590 --> 03:28:18.600 align:start position:0%
same companies conducting business here
 
03:28:21.070 --> 03:28:21.080 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire if I know that at one
 
03:28:24.550 --> 03:28:24.560 align:start position:0%
point in the not too distant past nearly
 
03:28:27.269 --> 03:28:27.279 align:start position:0%
all the trash dumped in New Hampshire
 
03:28:30.150 --> 03:28:30.160 align:start position:0%
was dumped in publicly owned
 
03:28:33.309 --> 03:28:33.319 align:start position:0%
landfills also known as the town
 
03:28:36.189 --> 03:28:36.199 align:start position:0%
dump and finally if I know Granite
 
03:28:39.110 --> 03:28:39.120 align:start position:0%
Staters Express strong opposition to the
 
03:28:42.189 --> 03:28:42.199 align:start position:0%
notion of our picturesque State being
 
03:28:44.910 --> 03:28:44.920 align:start position:0%
used as a Dumping Ground for
 
03:28:47.469 --> 03:28:47.479 align:start position:0%

Speaker I want to address some
 
04:53:08.750 --> 04:53:08.760 align:start position:0%
misinformation that you may have heard
 
04:53:11.510 --> 04:53:11.520 align:start position:0%
about this amendment the challenges of
 
04:53:14.310 --> 04:53:14.320 align:start position:0%
affordable housing are deeply complex
 
04:53:16.270 --> 04:53:16.280 align:start position:0%
this amendment is about
 
04:53:18.990 --> 04:53:19.000 align:start position:0%
commercial properties this is a
 
04:53:21.350 --> 04:53:21.360 align:start position:0%
commercial energy code Amendment and it
 
04:53:23.788 --> 04:53:23.798 align:start position:0%
does not affect most residential units
 
04:53:27.190 --> 04:53:27.200 align:start position:0%
in the state it will affect zero single
 
04:53:29.910 --> 04:53:29.920 align:start position:0%
family homes or any other residential
 
04:53:32.708 --> 04:53:32.718 align:start position:0%
spaces of three stories or less this
 
04:53:35.310 --> 04:53:35.320 align:start position:0%
amendment has no bearing on construction
 
04:53:39.310 --> 04:53:39.320 align:start position:0%
of new residential single family homes
 
04:53:41.628 --> 04:53:41.638 align:start position:0%
instead this amendment is to update the
 
04:53:44.910 --> 04:53:44.920 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire commercial energy code
 
04:53:49.270 --> 04:53:49.280 align:start position:0%
only from 2018 to 2021 standards there
 
04:53:51.948 --> 04:53:51.958 align:start position:0%
is no mandate in the commercial energy
 
04:53:55.390 --> 04:53:55.400 align:start position:0%
code to require Net Zero buildings as
 
04:53:56.548 --> 04:53:56.558 align:start position:0%
part of this
 
04:53:59.190 --> 04:53:59.200 align:start position:0%
update why should we adopt the 2021
 
04:54:01.910 --> 04:54:01.920 align:start position:0%
commercial energy code Granite Staters
 
04:54:05.110 --> 04:54:05.120 align:start position:0%
like you and me spend 95% of their time
 
04:54:07.430 --> 04:54:07.440 align:start position:0%
in buildings and the majority of this
 
04:54:09.590 --> 04:54:09.600 align:start position:0%
time is spent in commercial buildings
 
04:54:11.670 --> 04:54:11.680 align:start position:0%
schools and workplaces
 
04:54:13.350 --> 04:54:13.360 align:start position:0%
the change between the current energy
 
04:54:16.628 --> 04:54:16.638 align:start position:0%
code and the 2021 commercial energy code
 
04:54:19.230 --> 04:54:19.240 align:start position:0%
includes mechanical duct insulation a
 
04:54:21.430 --> 04:54:21.440 align:start position:0%
tighter Vapor Barrier on exterior walls
 
04:54:25.230 --> 04:54:25.240 align:start position:0%
to keep out mold and keep in humidity
 
04:54:27.910 --> 04:54:27.920 align:start position:0%
and increased air changes we've studied
 
04:54:30.070 --> 04:54:30.080 align:start position:0%
indoor Health in schools and found that
 
04:54:32.470 --> 04:54:32.480 align:start position:0%
in New England we need to keep the
 
04:54:35.350 --> 04:54:35.360 align:start position:0%
humidity levels between 40 and 60%
 
04:54:38.310 --> 04:54:38.320 align:start position:0%

this indoor air quality matters for
 
04:54:52.310 --> 04:54:52.320 align:start position:0%
human health and productivity there is a
 
04:54:54.270 --> 04:54:54.280 align:start position:0%
compelling business case for healthy
 
04:54:57.708 --> 04:54:57.718 align:start position:0%
buildings a Harvard cogg FX study found
 
04:55:00.070 --> 04:55:00.080 align:start position:0%
that breathing better air is better for
 
04:55:02.350 --> 04:55:02.360 align:start position:0%

04:55:13.670 --> 04:55:13.680 align:start position:0%
through a similar study that healthy
 
04:55:15.910 --> 04:55:15.920 align:start position:0%
buildings command higher rents per
 
04:55:18.670 --> 04:55:18.680 align:start position:0%

04:55:27.548 --> 04:55:27.558 align:start position:0%
commercial energy code does this as well
 
04:55:29.830 --> 04:55:29.840 align:start position:0%
we heard committee testimony that large
 
04:55:31.750 --> 04:55:31.760 align:start position:0%
commercial builders in New Hampshire
 
04:55:34.150 --> 04:55:34.160 align:start position:0%
support updating the commercial energy
 
04:55:37.270 --> 04:55:37.280 align:start position:0%
code to 2021 we need the commercial
 
04:55:39.548 --> 04:55:39.558 align:start position:0%
energy code failing to adopt the code
 
04:55:43.150 --> 04:55:43.160 align:start position:0%
will be a cost shift from contractors to
 
04:55:45.670 --> 04:55:45.680 align:start position:0%
building owners this will increase the
 
04:55:47.868 --> 04:55:47.878 align:start position:0%
cost for building owners that occupy
 
04:55:50.070 --> 04:55:50.080 align:start position:0%

commercial energy code is coste
 
04:56:17.590 --> 04:56:17.600 align:start position:0%
effective more than covering the added

construction labor and materials costs
 
04:56:22.190 --> 04:56:22.200 align:start position:0%

Speaker U first of all this amendment
 
04:56:52.110 --> 04:56:52.120 align:start position:0%
was seriously considered and rejected by
 
04:56:54.030 --> 04:56:54.040 align:start position:0%
the building code review board which
 
04:56:57.310 --> 04:56:57.320 align:start position:0%
consists of a panel of experts building
 
04:56:58.868 --> 04:56:58.878 align:start position:0%
officials building
 
04:57:01.390 --> 04:57:01.400 align:start position:0%
inspectors engineers and
 
04:57:03.628 --> 04:57:03.638 align:start position:0%
Architects they thought about it and
 
04:57:06.830 --> 04:57:06.840 align:start position:0%
decided it was not appropriate for New
 
04:57:09.590 --> 04:57:09.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the amend floor Amendment also
 
04:57:12.590 --> 04:57:12.600 align:start position:0%
strips out the specific New Hampshire
 
04:57:14.830 --> 04:57:14.840 align:start position:0%
amendments approved by the building code
 
04:57:20.190 --> 04:57:20.200 align:start position:0%
review board to the energy code which is
 
04:57:21.470 --> 04:57:21.480 align:start position:0%
which means that we're getting it
 
04:57:23.548 --> 04:57:23.558 align:start position:0%
straight unadulterated from uh
 
04:57:26.190 --> 04:57:26.200 align:start position:0%
California and New York and the other
 
04:57:26.200 --> 04:57:28.590 align:start position:0%

large
 
04:57:31.030 --> 04:57:31.040 align:start position:0%

home those people can choose to go to
 
04:57:57.788 --> 04:57:57.798 align:start position:0%
the more strict energy code no problem
 
04:58:00.030 --> 04:58:00.040 align:start position:0%
it's their it's well within their
 
04:58:03.150 --> 04:58:03.160 align:start position:0%
Authority and they they can choose to
 
04:58:06.390 --> 04:58:06.400 align:start position:0%
implement it without putting it as a
 
04:58:09.430 --> 04:58:09.440 align:start position:0%
requirement on everybody
 
04:58:09.440 --> 04:58:11.110 align:start position:0%
requirement on everybody
else

04:58:11.110 --> 04:58:11.120 align:start position:0%
else
 
04:58:13.470 --> 04:58:13.480 align:start position:0%
the other point is that you know saves
 
04:58:16.110 --> 04:58:16.120 align:start position:0%
energy saves energy costs over the life
 
04:58:18.470 --> 04:58:18.480 align:start position:0%
of the building well it might if you can
 
04:58:21.910 --> 04:58:21.920 align:start position:0%
pay for the for the technology and the
 
04:58:25.190 --> 04:58:25.200 align:start position:0%
testing and the extra materials right
 
04:58:27.750 --> 04:58:27.760 align:start position:0%
away if however you have to take out a
 
04:58:30.830 --> 04:58:30.840 align:start position:0%
30-year mortgage at s 7 and a
 
04:58:33.150 --> 04:58:33.160 align:start position:0%
half% you're not going to be able to pay
 
04:58:36.150 --> 04:58:36.160 align:start position:0%
for the difference in cost and that is a
 
04:58:39.470 --> 04:58:39.480 align:start position:0%
choice that the owner of the building
 
04:58:41.548 --> 04:58:41.558 align:start position:0%
should be able to make make for him or
 
04:58:44.628 --> 04:58:44.638 align:start position:0%
herself and that was what the Edna
 
04:58:47.510 --> 04:58:47.520 align:start position:0%
committee considered when we unanimously
 
04:58:51.708 --> 04:58:51.718 align:start position:0%

04:58:54.910 --> 04:58:54.920 align:start position:0%

ining thank you Mr
 
05:00:38.990 --> 05:00:39.000 align:start position:0%
Speaker if I know that the building
 
05:00:41.350 --> 05:00:41.360 align:start position:0%
construction review board didn't
 
05:00:45.548 --> 05:00:45.558 align:start position:0%
outright reject the um code BEC based on
 
05:00:48.510 --> 05:00:48.520 align:start position:0%
its Merit but because it took would
 
05:00:50.470 --> 05:00:50.480 align:start position:0%
taken too long to look at the code
 
05:00:52.470 --> 05:00:52.480 align:start position:0%
amendment by Amendment and the the
 
05:00:56.788 --> 05:00:56.798 align:start position:0%
energy code in 2018 was not adopted in
 
05:01:00.070 --> 05:01:00.080 align:start position:0%
full but certain amendments were
 
05:01:03.230 --> 05:01:03.240 align:start position:0%
addressed excuse me and if I know that
 
05:01:05.030 --> 05:01:05.040 align:start position:0%
this amendment has no bearing on
 
05:01:07.030 --> 05:01:07.040 align:start position:0%
construction of new residential single

and if I know and I think we all know
 
05:01:15.948 --> 05:01:15.958 align:start position:0%
that we spend 95% of our time in
 
05:01:18.590 --> 05:01:18.600 align:start position:0%
buildings and the majority of this time
 
05:01:20.590 --> 05:01:20.600 align:start position:0%
is spent in commercial buildings or
 
05:01:20.600 --> 05:01:22.190 align:start position:0%
is spent in commercial buildings or

house
 
05:01:25.430 --> 05:01:25.440 align:start position:0%
Chambers and that the 2021 energy code
 
05:01:27.310 --> 05:01:27.320 align:start position:0%

compact when passed by seven states this
 
05:08:41.830 --> 05:08:41.840 align:start position:0%
compact will allow licensed social

place the mental health Workforce
 
05:10:24.948 --> 05:10:24.958 align:start position:0%
shortage is a complicated multifaceted
 
05:10:27.788 --> 05:10:27.798 align:start position:0%
problem involving inadequate funding low

05:10:34.310 --> 05:10:34.320 align:start position:0%
difficult stressful work etc etc etc I
 
05:10:36.910 --> 05:10:36.920 align:start position:0%
am not going to lie to you if you pass
 
05:10:39.670 --> 05:10:39.680 align:start position:0%
this bill if we join the social work
 
05:10:42.070 --> 05:10:42.080 align:start position:0%
compact if a number of licensed social
 
05:10:43.628 --> 05:10:43.638 align:start position:0%

Hampshire free of bureaucratic hurdles
 
05:10:48.750 --> 05:10:48.760 align:start position:0%
this will not solve the mental health
 
05:10:51.510 --> 05:10:51.520 align:start position:0%
Workforce shortage here however is what
 
05:10:54.590 --> 05:10:54.600 align:start position:0%
it will do first it will provide one
 
05:10:56.868 --> 05:10:56.878 align:start position:0%
more useful tool to attract seasoned
 
05:10:58.628 --> 05:10:58.638 align:start position:0%
licensed social workers to either
 
05:11:01.070 --> 05:11:01.080 align:start position:0%
practice independently in the state or
 
05:11:03.310 --> 05:11:03.320 align:start position:0%
take jobs in our many understaffed
 
05:11:05.310 --> 05:11:05.320 align:start position:0%
agencies and therapy
 
05:11:07.628 --> 05:11:07.638 align:start position:0%
practices second it will also have an

immediate impact on our military

their providers and Social Work spouses
 
05:11:31.030 --> 05:11:31.040 align:start position:0%

organization if that becomes the case we
 
05:12:01.548 --> 05:12:01.558 align:start position:0%
can leave we've done this too this very
 
05:12:04.070 --> 05:12:04.080 align:start position:0%
part this very body passed the law to
 
05:12:07.070 --> 05:12:07.080 align:start position:0%
leave an EMT compact in
 
05:12:09.868 --> 05:12:09.878 align:start position:0%
2020 so please join me in enhan ening
 
05:12:11.230 --> 05:12:11.240 align:start position:0%
our response to New Hampshire's
 
05:12:13.830 --> 05:12:13.840 align:start position:0%
well-documented Mental Health crisis by

pushing the red button to defeat the itl
 
05:12:18.750 --> 05:12:18.760 align:start position:0%
motion so that another motion may be
 
05:12:22.030 --> 05:12:22.040 align:start position:0%
made and I would ask for a division vote
 
05:12:25.470 --> 05:12:25.480 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes representative Carol
 
05:12:29.948 --> 05:12:29.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:34.670 --> 05:12:34.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:36.948 --> 05:12:36.958 align:start position:0%
yield thank you Mr
 
05:12:39.590 --> 05:12:39.600 align:start position:0%
Speaker I would like to mention that the
 
05:12:42.310 --> 05:12:42.320 align:start position:0%
Rosy promises mentioned by the previous
 
05:12:44.430 --> 05:12:44.440 align:start position:0%
speaker are just not going to happen
 
05:12:46.948 --> 05:12:46.958 align:start position:0%
very soon because this is a brand new
 
05:12:49.310 --> 05:12:49.320 align:start position:0%
compact none of the states that we
 
05:12:52.470 --> 05:12:52.480 align:start position:0%
really want to be involved have joined
 
05:12:55.030 --> 05:12:55.040 align:start position:0%
the compact like Massachusetts or
 
05:12:57.430 --> 05:12:57.440 align:start position:0%
Florida or New York they're not even
 
05:12:59.910 --> 05:12:59.920 align:start position:0%
considering it there are some states
 
05:13:02.070 --> 05:13:02.080 align:start position:0%
considering it like Vermont and
 
05:13:05.868 --> 05:13:05.878 align:start position:0%
Maine but the states that are currently
 
05:13:08.990 --> 05:13:09.000 align:start position:0%
in the compact are Missouri Utah South
 
05:13:09.000 --> 05:13:10.070 align:start position:0%
in the compact are Missouri Utah South
Dakota

05:13:10.070 --> 05:13:10.080 align:start position:0%
Dakota
 
05:13:11.868 --> 05:13:11.878 align:start position:0%
which are not States we get a large
 
05:13:15.110 --> 05:13:15.120 align:start position:0%
number of social workers for the other
 
05:13:20.190 --> 05:13:20.200 align:start position:0%
issue is that just last year we passed a
 
05:13:23.150 --> 05:13:23.160 align:start position:0%
very broad
 
05:13:27.150 --> 05:13:27.160 align:start position:0%
reciprocity bill for licensing and so if
 
05:13:29.150 --> 05:13:29.160 align:start position:0%
someone a social worker from another
 
05:13:31.190 --> 05:13:31.200 align:start position:0%
state wants to come and work in New
 
05:13:34.548 --> 05:13:34.558 align:start position:0%
Hampshire they come in show their
 
05:13:36.548 --> 05:13:36.558 align:start position:0%
license from another state get their
 
05:13:39.548 --> 05:13:39.558 align:start position:0%
criminal background check and of course
 
05:13:41.830 --> 05:13:41.840 align:start position:0%
pay the fee and poof they have a New
 
05:13:45.270 --> 05:13:45.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire license and they are fully
 
05:13:48.150 --> 05:13:48.160 align:start position:0%
capable of practicing in the
 
05:13:51.510 --> 05:13:51.520 align:start position:0%
state with the compact discipline is an
 
05:13:55.670 --> 05:13:55.680 align:start position:0%
issue because we could only restrict
 
05:13:58.350 --> 05:13:58.360 align:start position:0%
someone's ability to practice in New
 
05:14:00.868 --> 05:14:00.878 align:start position:0%
Hampshire if there were a bad actor
 
05:14:03.150 --> 05:14:03.160 align:start position:0%
among the social workers they could
 
05:14:05.708 --> 05:14:05.718 align:start position:0%
still practice in all the other compact
 
05:14:09.470 --> 05:14:09.480 align:start position:0%
States unless and until their home state
 
05:14:12.990 --> 05:14:13.000 align:start position:0%
chose to take action that's a concern
 
05:14:16.390 --> 05:14:16.400 align:start position:0%
right now we can protect ourselves but
 
05:14:18.270 --> 05:14:18.280 align:start position:0%
we can't protect
 
05:14:21.708 --> 05:14:21.718 align:start position:0%
everybody and finally this is a very new
 
05:14:25.150 --> 05:14:25.160 align:start position:0%
compact that by the this bill that that
 
05:14:27.670 --> 05:14:27.680 align:start position:0%
organization has the power to buy and
 
05:14:30.750 --> 05:14:30.760 align:start position:0%
sell real estate hire people set their
 
05:14:33.390 --> 05:14:33.400 align:start position:0%
fees set their rules which have the
 
05:14:35.590 --> 05:14:35.600 align:start position:0%
force and effective law of
 
05:14:38.470 --> 05:14:38.480 align:start position:0%
course and we don't know what they are
 
05:14:40.310 --> 05:14:40.320 align:start position:0%
we don't know what their fees are
 
05:14:42.548 --> 05:14:42.558 align:start position:0%
planning to be we don't know how
 
05:14:44.150 --> 05:14:44.160 align:start position:0%
magnificent a structure they're going to
 
05:14:47.470 --> 05:14:47.480 align:start position:0%
build in uh Washington DC if it was were
 
05:14:50.628 --> 05:14:50.638 align:start position:0%
to be approved but if we vote for the
 
05:14:53.548 --> 05:14:53.558 align:start position:0%
compact now we're going to be stuck with
 
05:14:53.558 --> 05:14:55.270 align:start position:0%
compact now we're going to be stuck with
it

05:14:55.270 --> 05:14:55.280 align:start position:0%
it
 
05:14:57.948 --> 05:14:57.958 align:start position:0%
and you know a seat at the table may be
 
05:15:00.948 --> 05:15:00.958 align:start position:0%
nice but we'd be one out of seven or
 
05:15:04.470 --> 05:15:04.480 align:start position:0%
more and I can't see that our interests
 
05:15:07.868 --> 05:15:07.878 align:start position:0%
are going to overpower the interests of
 
05:15:10.030 --> 05:15:10.040 align:start position:0%
other states and other people
 
05:15:12.070 --> 05:15:12.080 align:start position:0%
so I think that we are essentially
 
05:15:14.708 --> 05:15:14.718 align:start position:0%
buying into a pig and a poke in the hope
 
05:15:16.868 --> 05:15:16.878 align:start position:0%
that it will help our social work
 
05:15:21.110 --> 05:15:21.120 align:start position:0%
contract our Mental Health crisis and
 
05:15:24.708 --> 05:15:24.718 align:start position:0%
when we have other more reliable methods
 
05:15:27.670 --> 05:15:27.680 align:start position:0%
of getting more social workers and other
 
05:15:28.910 --> 05:15:28.920 align:start position:0%
mental health
 
05:15:30.990 --> 05:15:31.000 align:start position:0%
professionals I hope you will join with
 
05:15:33.548 --> 05:15:33.558 align:start position:0%
me in the majority of the of the
 
05:15:36.990 --> 05:15:37.000 align:start position:0%
committee in voting for The itl please
 
05:15:38.230 --> 05:15:38.240 align:start position:0%
press the green
 
05:15:40.670 --> 05:15:40.680 align:start position:0%
button representative Sweeny has

inquiry thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker
 
05:17:50.270 --> 05:17:50.280 align:start position:0%
if I know that what we're voting on
 
05:17:52.230 --> 05:17:52.240 align:start position:0%
today we have absolutely no idea what
 
05:17:54.390 --> 05:17:54.400 align:start position:0%
we're actually voting on um it hasn't
 
05:17:56.628 --> 05:17:56.638 align:start position:0%
been defined yet and Mr Speaker if I
 
05:18:00.030 --> 05:18:00.040 align:start position:0%
know that um accountability in this
 
05:18:02.510 --> 05:18:02.520 align:start position:0%
compact from a state level is uncertain
 
05:18:03.750 --> 05:18:03.760 align:start position:0%
to the point at which if there's
 
05:18:05.750 --> 05:18:05.760 align:start position:0%
malpractice in our state it's uncertain
 
05:18:07.350 --> 05:18:07.360 align:start position:0%
whether or not we would oversee that
 
05:18:09.390 --> 05:18:09.400 align:start position:0%
malpractice in our own courts or or that
 
05:18:11.430 --> 05:18:11.440 align:start position:0%
would be handled at the federal level we
 
05:18:13.430 --> 05:18:13.440 align:start position:0%
don't even know that and Mr Speaker if
 
05:18:15.110 --> 05:18:15.120 align:start position:0%
we have pulled out of a compact before
 
05:18:16.788 --> 05:18:16.798 align:start position:0%
in the past because it didn't work out
 
05:18:18.708 --> 05:18:18.718 align:start position:0%
very well why in the world would we
 
05:18:20.430 --> 05:18:20.440 align:start position:0%
enter a compact before we even know what
 
05:18:22.868 --> 05:18:22.878 align:start position:0%
the compact is uh for those reasons Mr
 
05:18:25.270 --> 05:18:25.280 align:start position:0%
Speaker I would ask that regardless of
 
05:18:26.788 --> 05:18:26.798 align:start position:0%
your concerns about the Mental Health
 
05:18:29.390 --> 05:18:29.400 align:start position:0%
crisis which we all share uh that this

05:22:12.948 --> 05:22:12.958 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker for allowing to

speak on this amendment before us here
 
05:22:18.190 --> 05:22:18.200 align:start position:0%
uh the amendment is about in the bill to
 
05:22:20.830 --> 05:22:20.840 align:start position:0%
the the underlying bill is about
 
05:22:23.270 --> 05:22:23.280 align:start position:0%
mid-level practitioners healthc care
 
05:22:25.230 --> 05:22:25.240 align:start position:0%
practitioners the state of New Hampshire
 
05:22:27.628 --> 05:22:27.638 align:start position:0%
licenses two types of mid-level
 
05:22:29.788 --> 05:22:29.798 align:start position:0%
practitioners and invariably many if not
 
05:22:31.910 --> 05:22:31.920 align:start position:0%
most of us have visited one of those
 
05:22:34.708 --> 05:22:34.718 align:start position:0%
their nurse practitioners and physicians
 
05:22:37.310 --> 05:22:37.320 align:start position:0%
assistant while both professions demand
 
05:22:40.230 --> 05:22:40.240 align:start position:0%
rigorous post-graduate education there
 
05:22:42.590 --> 05:22:42.600 align:start position:0%
exists a notable discrepancy in the
 
05:22:45.670 --> 05:22:45.680 align:start position:0%
administrative burdens they face despite
 
05:22:47.868 --> 05:22:47.878 align:start position:0%
more academic credit hours and a larger
 
05:22:50.470 --> 05:22:50.480 align:start position:0%
clinical hour requirement Pas must
 
05:22:52.750 --> 05:22:52.760 align:start position:0%
engage in a written collaboration
 
05:22:56.910 --> 05:22:56.920 align:start position:0%
agreement upon graduation unlike nurse
 
05:22:59.110 --> 05:22:59.120 align:start position:0%
practitioners one might speculate that
 
05:23:02.030 --> 05:23:02.040 align:start position:0%
this stems from nurses richer clinical
 
05:23:03.948 --> 05:23:03.958 align:start position:0%
backgrounds however it's crucial to
 
05:23:06.230 --> 05:23:06.240 align:start position:0%
recognize that even with years of
 
05:23:09.070 --> 05:23:09.080 align:start position:0%
experience Pas remain tethered these
 
05:23:11.590 --> 05:23:11.600 align:start position:0%
agreements with Physicians it's worth
 
05:23:14.110 --> 05:23:14.120 align:start position:0%
noting that these agreements often are a
 
05:23:14.120 --> 05:23:15.628 align:start position:0%
noting that these agreements often are a
mere

05:23:15.628 --> 05:23:15.638 align:start position:0%
mere
 
05:23:18.190 --> 05:23:18.200 align:start position:0%
formality with collaborating Physicians
 
05:23:20.948 --> 05:23:20.958 align:start position:0%
bearing no shared liability with the Pas
 
05:23:22.430 --> 05:23:22.440 align:start position:0%
they're linked to and in fact we've
 
05:23:26.070 --> 05:23:26.080 align:start position:0%
heard stories of Physicians charging Pas
 
05:23:28.670 --> 05:23:28.680 align:start position:0%
thousands of dollars a year to enter
 
05:23:29.830 --> 05:23:29.840 align:start position:0%
into these
 
05:23:32.390 --> 05:23:32.400 align:start position:0%
agreements so the amendment before us
 
05:23:33.868 --> 05:23:33.878 align:start position:0%
right now today has we have an
 
05:23:37.350 --> 05:23:37.360 align:start position:0%
opportunity to fix this and rectify this
 
05:23:39.548 --> 05:23:39.558 align:start position:0%
in congruity and Accord our mid-level
 
05:23:42.750 --> 05:23:42.760 align:start position:0%
providers the respect they deserve as
 
05:23:45.510 --> 05:23:45.520 align:start position:0%
professionals that they are the proposed
 
05:23:48.788 --> 05:23:48.798 align:start position:0%
amendment maintains the necessity of
 
05:23:51.708 --> 05:23:51.718 align:start position:0%
collaboration between Pas and doctors
 
05:23:54.150 --> 05:23:54.160 align:start position:0%
yet it introduces a pivotal change after
 
05:23:57.548 --> 05:23:57.558 align:start position:0%
8,000 hours of clinical practice the
 
05:23:59.390 --> 05:23:59.400 align:start position:0%
requirement for these agreements to be
 
05:24:02.190 --> 05:24:02.200 align:start position:0%
written is lifted this amendment was
 
05:24:04.190 --> 05:24:04.200 align:start position:0%
carefully crafted and agreed to by many
 
05:24:06.070 --> 05:24:06.080 align:start position:0%
of the stakeholders involved in this Con
 
05:24:07.548 --> 05:24:07.558 align:start position:0%
conversation and I want to thank my
 
05:24:09.708 --> 05:24:09.718 align:start position:0%
colleagues who over the last four or
 
05:24:12.470 --> 05:24:12.480 align:start position:0%
five days worked hard to to put this
 
05:24:14.670 --> 05:24:14.680 align:start position:0%
together um this amendment is not just a
 
05:24:16.190 --> 05:24:16.200 align:start position:0%
legislative step it's a statement of
 
05:24:17.990 --> 05:24:18.000 align:start position:0%
acknowledgement and empowerment to our
 
05:24:20.430 --> 05:24:20.440 align:start position:0%
health care providers and a testament to

dep departments and administration to
 
05:25:28.910 --> 05:25:28.920 align:start position:0%
which was referred House Bill 1271 act
 
05:25:31.948 --> 05:25:31.958 align:start position:0%
relative to the conversation combination
 
05:25:34.390 --> 05:25:34.400 align:start position:0%
and reorganization of boards and
 
05:25:36.590 --> 05:25:36.600 align:start position:0%
advisory boards we considered the same
 
05:25:38.230 --> 05:25:38.240 align:start position:0%
report the same with a recommendation of
 
05:25:40.788 --> 05:25:40.798 align:start position:0%
the bill will be referred for interim
 
05:25:44.510 --> 05:25:44.520 align:start position:0%
study representative JC groy for the
 
05:25:46.910 --> 05:25:46.920 align:start position:0%
committee minority of the committee
 
05:25:48.670 --> 05:25:48.680 align:start position:0%
having considered the same being unable
 
05:25:50.390 --> 05:25:50.400 align:start position:0%
to agree with the majority Report with
 
05:25:51.510 --> 05:25:51.520 align:start position:0%
the following Amendment and a
 
05:25:52.910 --> 05:25:52.920 align:start position:0%
recommendation the bill ought to pass
 
05:25:54.990 --> 05:25:55.000 align:start position:0%
with Amendment sen Tony leus for the
 
05:25:56.510 --> 05:25:56.520 align:start position:0%
minority of the
 
05:25:58.788 --> 05:25:58.798 align:start position:0%
committee the chair
 
05:26:07.350 --> 05:26:07.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:10.110 --> 05:26:10.120 align:start position:0%
leakas thank you than you Mr
 
05:26:13.910 --> 05:26:13.920 align:start position:0%
Speaker so this bill converts a number
 
05:26:16.030 --> 05:26:16.040 align:start position:0%
of the occupational licensing boards to
 
05:26:17.430 --> 05:26:17.440 align:start position:0%
advisory from
 
05:26:19.470 --> 05:26:19.480 align:start position:0%
regulatory the difference is that a
 
05:26:21.510 --> 05:26:21.520 align:start position:0%
regulatory board has the authority to do
 
05:26:24.190 --> 05:26:24.200 align:start position:0%
Ru making on licensing requirements and
 
05:26:26.788 --> 05:26:26.798 align:start position:0%
to make the decisions on complaints well
 
05:26:28.628 --> 05:26:28.638 align:start position:0%
an Advisory board with for an Advisory
 
05:26:31.390 --> 05:26:31.400 align:start position:0%
Board The Authority is with the office
 
05:26:33.310 --> 05:26:33.320 align:start position:0%
the issue is that a regulator board
 
05:26:34.868 --> 05:26:34.878 align:start position:0%
consists of people working in a
 
05:26:37.548 --> 05:26:37.558 align:start position:0%
profession deciding on the requirements
 
05:26:39.310 --> 05:26:39.320 align:start position:0%
and adjudicating complaints against
 
05:26:41.470 --> 05:26:41.480 align:start position:0%
others in the same profession who are
 
05:26:42.750 --> 05:26:42.760 align:start position:0%
potentially their
 
05:26:45.070 --> 05:26:45.080 align:start position:0%
competitors this is a particular problem
 
05:26:47.670 --> 05:26:47.680 align:start position:0%
for professions with relatively few
 
05:26:50.190 --> 05:26:50.200 align:start position:0%
lies the boards affected by this Bill
 
05:26:53.430 --> 05:26:53.440 align:start position:0%
are such for such professions midwives
 
05:26:55.670 --> 05:26:55.680 align:start position:0%
are the best example of this there are
 
05:26:58.190 --> 05:26:58.200 align:start position:0%
33 licensed midwives in the state and
 
05:26:59.750 --> 05:26:59.760 align:start position:0%
the three on the board make up almost
 
05:27:01.708 --> 05:27:01.718 align:start position:0%
10% of all those
 
05:27:03.548 --> 05:27:03.558 align:start position:0%
licensed there have been a number of
 
05:27:05.628 --> 05:27:05.638 align:start position:0%
antitrust suits against States based on
 
05:27:08.590 --> 05:27:08.600 align:start position:0%
the regulatory board form of Licensing
 
05:27:10.868 --> 05:27:10.878 align:start position:0%
one made it to the Supreme Court in 2015
 
05:27:13.190 --> 05:27:13.200 align:start position:0%
against South Carolina and the state and
 
05:27:15.830 --> 05:27:15.840 align:start position:0%
the dental licensing board lost the case
 
05:27:17.430 --> 05:27:17.440 align:start position:0%
there was a significant monetary
 
05:27:19.510 --> 05:27:19.520 align:start position:0%
judgment against both the state and the
 
05:27:21.910 --> 05:27:21.920 align:start position:0%
individual members of the board there
 
05:27:23.750 --> 05:27:23.760 align:start position:0%
was another antitrust case against a
 
05:27:26.430 --> 05:27:26.440 align:start position:0%
board of acupuncture the court found
 
05:27:28.110 --> 05:27:28.120 align:start position:0%
against the acupuncture board after the
 
05:27:30.948 --> 05:27:30.958 align:start position:0%
state incurred almost $350,000 in legal
 
05:27:34.390 --> 05:27:34.400 align:start position:0%
fees lenses were required to pay higher
 
05:27:37.150 --> 05:27:37.160 align:start position:0%
fees to cover those expenses the cost
 
05:27:39.110 --> 05:27:39.120 align:start position:0%
exceeded all revenue from acupuncture
 
05:27:41.590 --> 05:27:41.600 align:start position:0%
Licensing in that state higher fees are
 
05:27:43.270 --> 05:27:43.280 align:start position:0%
likely to be the result in New Hampshire
 
05:27:45.708 --> 05:27:45.718 align:start position:0%
since occupational licensing fees are
 
05:27:48.350 --> 05:27:48.360 align:start position:0%
required to cover the costs of
 
05:27:50.830 --> 05:27:50.840 align:start position:0%
Licensing the US Supreme Court held that
 
05:27:52.990 --> 05:27:53.000 align:start position:0%
Professional Licensing boards compris
 
05:27:55.708 --> 05:27:55.718 align:start position:0%
primarily of active Market participants
 
05:27:58.430 --> 05:27:58.440 align:start position:0%
have immunity from Anti-Trust laws only
 
05:28:00.430 --> 05:28:00.440 align:start position:0%
when they're actively supervised by the
 
05:28:02.990 --> 05:28:03.000 align:start position:0%
state advisory licensing boards have
 
05:28:04.390 --> 05:28:04.400 align:start position:0%
this immunity because although they
 
05:28:07.070 --> 05:28:07.080 align:start position:0%
advise the office they do not have final
 
05:28:09.708 --> 05:28:09.718 align:start position:0%
Authority regular atory boards have no
 
05:28:12.590 --> 05:28:12.600 align:start position:0%
such immunity from a Harvard Law Journal
 
05:28:14.910 --> 05:28:14.920 align:start position:0%
article quote Regulators are therefore
 
05:28:17.510 --> 05:28:17.520 align:start position:0%
advised to be extremely careful those
 
05:28:19.070 --> 05:28:19.080 align:start position:0%
who think of themselves as public
 
05:28:20.990 --> 05:28:21.000 align:start position:0%
officials might find that they are sadly
 
05:28:23.230 --> 05:28:23.240 align:start position:0%
mistaken all the more sadly to the
 
05:28:24.750 --> 05:28:24.760 align:start position:0%
extent that they find themselves having
 
05:28:26.910 --> 05:28:26.920 align:start position:0%
to pay out-of-pocket damages for their
 
05:28:29.830 --> 05:28:29.840 align:start position:0%
reg to their regulatory victims over
 
05:28:31.548 --> 05:28:31.558 align:start position:0%
five states have passed legislation
 
05:28:33.030 --> 05:28:33.040 align:start position:0%
similar to this bill since the US
 
05:28:35.510 --> 05:28:35.520 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court case other states have not
 
05:28:37.628 --> 05:28:37.638 align:start position:0%
used uh regulatory boards even prior to
 
05:28:39.990 --> 05:28:40.000 align:start position:0%
that both the problem and the solution
 
05:28:42.548 --> 05:28:42.558 align:start position:0%
are well understood there is nothing to
 
05:28:44.470 --> 05:28:44.480 align:start position:0%
study this is an active area of
 
05:28:46.230 --> 05:28:46.240 align:start position:0%
litigation and it's likely only a matter
 
05:28:48.070 --> 05:28:48.080 align:start position:0%
of time before New Hampshire licensing
 
05:28:50.948 --> 05:28:50.958 align:start position:0%
board is sued and loses please join me
 
05:28:52.830 --> 05:28:52.840 align:start position:0%
in acting now and vote red to overturn
 
05:28:55.030 --> 05:28:55.040 align:start position:0%
the interim study recommendation so
 
05:28:58.750 --> 05:28:58.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:07.350 --> 05:29:07.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:07.360 --> 05:29:09.230 align:start position:0%
 
short

05:29:09.230 --> 05:29:09.240 align:start position:0%
short
 
05:29:10.590 --> 05:29:10.600 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr
 
05:29:13.750 --> 05:29:13.760 align:start position:0%
Speaker while the majority of Edna
 
05:29:16.670 --> 05:29:16.680 align:start position:0%
committee appreciated the heavy work
 
05:29:19.590 --> 05:29:19.600 align:start position:0%
done on the minority Amendment we still
 
05:29:22.788 --> 05:29:22.798 align:start position:0%
do not feel it is ready for passage and
 
05:29:26.190 --> 05:29:26.200 align:start position:0%
so we are recommending further study
 
05:29:28.868 --> 05:29:28.878 align:start position:0%
this bill was requested by the office of
 
05:29:32.150 --> 05:29:32.160 align:start position:0%
professional Li Insurance certification
 
05:29:34.990 --> 05:29:35.000 align:start position:0%
oplc for several stated
 
05:29:37.910 --> 05:29:37.920 align:start position:0%
reasons first that so many of the boards
 
05:29:40.948 --> 05:29:40.958 align:start position:0%
comprise so few members of a given
 
05:29:43.548 --> 05:29:43.558 align:start position:0%
profession that members who serve on the
 
05:29:45.830 --> 05:29:45.840 align:start position:0%
boards would be liable to antitrust
 
05:29:48.590 --> 05:29:48.600 align:start position:0%
lawsuits and charges of conflict of
 
05:29:51.708 --> 05:29:51.718 align:start position:0%
interest as has happened in one other
 
05:29:54.948 --> 05:29:54.958 align:start position:0%
state that we know of and to avoid such
 
05:29:58.390 --> 05:29:58.400 align:start position:0%
liability the state needs to have more
 
05:30:01.310 --> 05:30:01.320 align:start position:0%
oversight no such suit has happened in
 
05:30:04.270 --> 05:30:04.280 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire but following the lead of
 
05:30:07.230 --> 05:30:07.240 align:start position:0%
six other states it was recommended that
 
05:30:10.110 --> 05:30:10.120 align:start position:0%
many of these boards should be repealed
 
05:30:12.110 --> 05:30:12.120 align:start position:0%
combined or made
 
05:30:14.910 --> 05:30:14.920 align:start position:0%
advisory we were also told that many
 
05:30:18.628 --> 05:30:18.638 align:start position:0%
board meetings had not been held because
 
05:30:21.548 --> 05:30:21.558 align:start position:0%
many of the professions could not supply
 
05:30:22.948 --> 05:30:22.958 align:start position:0%
enough board
 
05:30:25.190 --> 05:30:25.200 align:start position:0%
members during the full Committee
 
05:30:27.990 --> 05:30:28.000 align:start position:0%
hearing we heard from several of the
 
05:30:31.150 --> 05:30:31.160 align:start position:0%
professions that they opposed the bill
 
05:30:34.070 --> 05:30:34.080 align:start position:0%
and refuted the reasoning behind it
 
05:30:36.390 --> 05:30:36.400 align:start position:0%
because while meetings were suspended
 
05:30:38.948 --> 05:30:38.958 align:start position:0%
during the pandemic and were slow to
 
05:30:41.590 --> 05:30:41.600 align:start position:0%
resume they are getting back to normal
 
05:30:45.270 --> 05:30:45.280 align:start position:0%
since then some also did not agree with
 
05:30:48.110 --> 05:30:48.120 align:start position:0%
the argument of two few members causing
 
05:30:49.788 --> 05:30:49.798 align:start position:0%
liability or
 
05:30:52.830 --> 05:30:52.840 align:start position:0%
conflicts and we are still hearing from
 
05:30:56.150 --> 05:30:56.160 align:start position:0%
many members opposing the minority
 
05:30:59.470 --> 05:30:59.480 align:start position:0%
Amendment for example The
 
05:31:02.390 --> 05:31:02.400 align:start position:0%
acupuncturists Who according to figures
 
05:31:04.430 --> 05:31:04.440 align:start position:0%
provided by
 
05:31:09.750 --> 05:31:09.760 align:start position:0%
oplc have 190 lenses and met six times
 
05:31:09.760 --> 05:31:11.230 align:start position:0%
oplc have 190 lenses and met six times
in

05:31:11.230 --> 05:31:11.240 align:start position:0%
in
 
05:31:16.030 --> 05:31:16.040 align:start position:0%
2023 the septic evaluators with 141
 
05:31:20.070 --> 05:31:20.080 align:start position:0%
lenses met four times last year and
 
05:31:24.548 --> 05:31:24.558 align:start position:0%
nursing home administrators with 167
 
05:31:27.910 --> 05:31:27.920 align:start position:0%
licenses met nine times last
 
05:31:30.190 --> 05:31:30.200 align:start position:0%
year yes some of the boards in the
 
05:31:32.910 --> 05:31:32.920 align:start position:0%
amendment are small and did have few or
 
05:31:36.110 --> 05:31:36.120 align:start position:0%
no meetings but the three I just listed
 
05:31:39.590 --> 05:31:39.600 align:start position:0%
are still included in the
 
05:31:42.390 --> 05:31:42.400 align:start position:0%
amendment also included in the amendment
 
05:31:45.030 --> 05:31:45.040 align:start position:0%
is the guardian at Liam board which
 
05:31:47.628 --> 05:31:47.638 align:start position:0%
opposed the bill stating that they are
 
05:31:50.030 --> 05:31:50.040 align:start position:0%
currently quasi
 
05:31:52.350 --> 05:31:52.360 align:start position:0%
judicial two members appointed by the
 
05:31:54.830 --> 05:31:54.840 align:start position:0%
court five members appointed by the
 
05:31:57.230 --> 05:31:57.240 align:start position:0%
governor and two
 
05:32:00.628 --> 05:32:00.638 align:start position:0%
legislators the amendment changing it to
 
05:32:04.350 --> 05:32:04.360 align:start position:0%

inquiry thank you Mr
 
05:36:34.150 --> 05:36:34.160 align:start position:0%
Speaker Mr Speaker if I know that some
 
05:36:36.948 --> 05:36:36.958 align:start position:0%
boards may be better off as advisory due
 
05:36:40.110 --> 05:36:40.120 align:start position:0%
to their smaller size and inability to
 
05:36:43.150 --> 05:36:43.160 align:start position:0%
meet but Mr Speaker if I know that a
 
05:36:46.510 --> 05:36:46.520 align:start position:0%
number of the boards in this bill do not
 
05:36:47.708 --> 05:36:47.718 align:start position:0%
meet this
 
05:36:50.948 --> 05:36:50.958 align:start position:0%
criteria that we have heard
 
05:36:54.430 --> 05:36:54.440 align:start position:0%

05:37:02.910 --> 05:37:02.920 align:start position:0%
evaluators and Mr Speaker if I know the
 
05:37:04.830 --> 05:37:04.840 align:start position:0%
majority of the Edna committee believes
 
05:37:07.510 --> 05:37:07.520 align:start position:0%
a thorough review of the boards needs to
 
05:37:09.430 --> 05:37:09.440 align:start position:0%
be done to determine which board should
 
05:37:12.190 --> 05:37:12.200 align:start position:0%
be changed to advisory through an intrum
 
05:37:14.470 --> 05:37:14.480 align:start position:0%
study then Mr Speaker would I support
 
05:37:16.948 --> 05:37:16.958 align:start position:0%

the employees contribution which would
 
05:45:16.430 --> 05:45:16.440 align:start position:0%
be proportional to the increase of

Speaker she was I had two different
 
05:47:45.190 --> 05:47:45.200 align:start position:0%
versions of this I glad I get get to
 
05:47:46.350 --> 05:47:46.360 align:start position:0%
give one of them
 
05:47:49.030 --> 05:47:49.040 align:start position:0%
anyway but uh yeah my my name is Mike
 
05:47:52.190 --> 05:47:52.200 align:start position:0%
Edgar and uh this bill here is is really
 
05:47:56.390 --> 05:47:56.400 align:start position:0%
for the city and towns um you know we we
 
05:47:58.990 --> 05:47:59.000 align:start position:0%
uh we had a retirement system back in
 
05:48:01.270 --> 05:48:01.280 align:start position:0%
the 60s it was like four different ones
 
05:48:03.230 --> 05:48:03.240 align:start position:0%
and then they State wanted to combin
 
05:48:06.590 --> 05:48:06.600 align:start position:0%
into one and uh the towns and cities
 
05:48:07.670 --> 05:48:07.680 align:start position:0%
agree but
 
05:48:11.230 --> 05:48:11.240 align:start position:0%
but at the same time when the uh State
 
05:48:12.788 --> 05:48:12.798 align:start position:0%
convinced the cities and towns to do it
 
05:48:15.868 --> 05:48:15.878 align:start position:0%
they promis to subsidize or pay for 40%
 
05:48:16.830 --> 05:48:16.840 align:start position:0%
of what the
 
05:48:18.948 --> 05:48:18.958 align:start position:0%
employer in this case the cities and
 
05:48:21.708 --> 05:48:21.718 align:start position:0%
towns would have to pay well eventually
 
05:48:23.948 --> 05:48:23.958 align:start position:0%
that got decreased but I want to remind
 
05:48:26.990 --> 05:48:27.000 align:start position:0%
everybody this is for the teachers the
 
05:48:29.390 --> 05:48:29.400 align:start position:0%
police the
 
05:48:31.510 --> 05:48:31.520 align:start position:0%
firefighters those are the ones that are
 
05:48:34.310 --> 05:48:34.320 align:start position:0%
getting uh getting the retirement which
 
05:48:35.990 --> 05:48:36.000 align:start position:0%
they're paying quite a bit for because
 
05:48:37.510 --> 05:48:37.520 align:start position:0%
it was increased as it was mentioned
 
05:48:39.910 --> 05:48:39.920 align:start position:0%
earlier what they're paying is is quite
 
05:48:41.990 --> 05:48:42.000 align:start position:0%
a bit
 
05:48:45.830 --> 05:48:45.840 align:start position:0%
so basically we had it where the state
 
05:48:48.750 --> 05:48:48.760 align:start position:0%
was going to contribute 40% and then
 
05:48:51.110 --> 05:48:51.120 align:start position:0%
basically get down to 2011 where they
 
05:48:51.120 --> 05:48:52.150 align:start position:0%
basically get down to 2011 where they
pay

05:48:52.150 --> 05:48:52.160 align:start position:0%
pay
 
05:48:58.070 --> 05:48:58.080 align:start position:0%
zero uh my goodness but the uh I first
 
05:49:00.590 --> 05:49:00.600 align:start position:0%
became involved with this with uh the
 
05:49:03.390 --> 05:49:03.400 align:start position:0%
former uh representative from Hampton
 
05:49:06.070 --> 05:49:06.080 align:start position:0%
reny Cushing uh was bringing this up he
 
05:49:08.190 --> 05:49:08.200 align:start position:0%
was always trying to get
 
05:49:10.510 --> 05:49:10.520 align:start position:0%
basically to stop the downshifting and
 
05:49:13.030 --> 05:49:13.040 align:start position:0%
to get the cities and towns what what's
 
05:49:15.150 --> 05:49:15.160 align:start position:0%
do them and this is one of the ones that
 
05:49:18.510 --> 05:49:18.520 align:start position:0%
he really uh he was really aid about and
 
05:49:21.430 --> 05:49:21.440 align:start position:0%
then uh one of my best uh memories of
 
05:49:23.310 --> 05:49:23.320 align:start position:0%
this this whole topic which we discussed
 
05:49:28.070 --> 05:49:28.080 align:start position:0%
several times is when our uh fighting
 
05:49:31.350 --> 05:49:31.360 align:start position:0%
leprechaun brought this up two years ago
 
05:49:33.510 --> 05:49:33.520 align:start position:0%
and we actually got it passed in the
 
05:49:36.548 --> 05:49:36.558 align:start position:0%
house uh Michael Bryan did a great job
 
05:49:39.190 --> 05:49:39.200 align:start position:0%
and I think that was uh that was really
 
05:49:40.830 --> 05:49:40.840 align:start position:0%
something to
 
05:49:45.990 --> 05:49:46.000 align:start position:0%
see so the uh it's eventally mentioned
 
05:49:48.750 --> 05:49:48.760 align:start position:0%
that uh property uh tax relief this bill
 
05:49:50.628 --> 05:49:50.638 align:start position:0%
was criticized because it had the words
 
05:49:53.628 --> 05:49:53.638 align:start position:0%
property tax relief in it and I guess it
 
05:49:55.750 --> 05:49:55.760 align:start position:0%
must be a popular term
 
05:49:58.190 --> 05:49:58.200 align:start position:0%
because a bill that was put in by the
 
05:49:58.200 --> 05:49:59.030 align:start position:0%
because a bill that was put in by the
other

05:49:59.030 --> 05:49:59.040 align:start position:0%
other
 
05:50:02.788 --> 05:50:02.798 align:start position:0%
side they Ed the same term property tax
 
05:50:05.070 --> 05:50:05.080 align:start position:0%
relief but what they did was they
 
05:50:08.350 --> 05:50:08.360 align:start position:0%
changed it so that there was only one
 
05:50:12.270 --> 05:50:12.280 align:start position:0%
year of it and that was in 22 2022 and
 
05:50:15.070 --> 05:50:15.080 align:start position:0%
it was great between the towns and the
 
05:50:18.590 --> 05:50:18.600 align:start position:0%
cities they got about uh 28 million back
 
05:50:21.110 --> 05:50:21.120 align:start position:0%
but it's interesting that it also
 
05:50:24.430 --> 05:50:24.440 align:start position:0%
getting that through it also had a uh
 
05:50:26.190 --> 05:50:26.200 align:start position:0%
business tax relief in it that was part
 
05:50:27.948 --> 05:50:27.958 align:start position:0%
of that bill that was put in with it for
 
05:50:28.868 --> 05:50:28.878 align:start position:0%
the one
 
05:50:28.878 --> 05:50:30.590 align:start position:0%
the one
year

05:50:30.590 --> 05:50:30.600 align:start position:0%
year
 
05:50:34.708 --> 05:50:34.718 align:start position:0%
but so the
 
05:50:38.030 --> 05:50:38.040 align:start position:0%
uh basically the state reneg on their uh
 
05:50:41.670 --> 05:50:41.680 align:start position:0%
their promise and towns could really
 
05:50:44.270 --> 05:50:44.280 align:start position:0%
really use the
 
05:50:47.270 --> 05:50:47.280 align:start position:0%
money so I hope that the people can uh
 
05:50:50.788 --> 05:50:50.798 align:start position:0%
see to actually approve this basically
 
05:50:52.750 --> 05:50:52.760 align:start position:0%
won't be to approve the final bill after
 
05:50:55.590 --> 05:50:55.600 align:start position:0%
we we change it but vote
 
05:50:57.830 --> 05:50:57.840 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr Speaker this is a perennial
 
05:51:16.390 --> 05:51:16.400 align:start position:0%
bill and we had the identical Bill last
 
05:51:19.670 --> 05:51:19.680 align:start position:0%
year in house bill 50 when that bill
 
05:51:22.548 --> 05:51:22.558 align:start position:0%
came to the finance committee um we
 
05:51:26.070 --> 05:51:26.080 align:start position:0%
chose to redirect it for the same
 
05:51:29.390 --> 05:51:29.400 align:start position:0%
purpose but not as an immediate payment
 
05:51:31.070 --> 05:51:31.080 align:start position:0%
to to
 
05:51:33.990 --> 05:51:34.000 align:start position:0%
municipalities but as a pay down to the
 
05:51:34.000 --> 05:51:35.190 align:start position:0%
municipalities but as a pay down to the
unfunded

05:51:35.190 --> 05:51:35.200 align:start position:0%
unfunded
 
05:51:38.628 --> 05:51:38.638 align:start position:0%
liability of the pension system that's a
 
05:51:42.910 --> 05:51:42.920 align:start position:0%
slow way and steady way of improving the
 
05:51:46.830 --> 05:51:46.840 align:start position:0%
pension system over the long Hall rather
 
05:51:49.868 --> 05:51:49.878 align:start position:0%
than a shot in the arm uh for this
 
05:51:49.878 --> 05:51:53.070 align:start position:0%
than a shot in the arm uh for this
year's

05:51:53.070 --> 05:51:53.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:55.868 --> 05:51:55.878 align:start position:0%
municipalities so um that's what we
 
05:51:58.230 --> 05:51:58.240 align:start position:0%
that's what we passed it was passed by a
 
05:52:01.270 --> 05:52:01.280 align:start position:0%
very strong vote on the house floor we
 
05:52:02.948 --> 05:52:02.958 align:start position:0%
put it into the
 
05:52:06.390 --> 05:52:06.400 align:start position:0%
budget unfortunately it was ripped out
 
05:52:08.548 --> 05:52:08.558 align:start position:0%
by the our friends on the other side of
 
05:52:08.558 --> 05:52:09.310 align:start position:0%
by the our friends on the other side of
the

05:52:09.310 --> 05:52:09.320 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:52:12.310 --> 05:52:12.320 align:start position:0%
wall um and because we did not go to a
 
05:52:14.868 --> 05:52:14.878 align:start position:0%
committee of conference that was the end
 
05:52:17.788 --> 05:52:17.798 align:start position:0%
of it for last year it's something that
 
05:52:19.708 --> 05:52:19.718 align:start position:0%
in a committee of conference we would
 
05:52:21.910 --> 05:52:21.920 align:start position:0%
have argued for
 
05:52:25.948 --> 05:52:25.958 align:start position:0%
strongly this year earlier this year we
 
05:52:30.628 --> 05:52:30.638 align:start position:0%
repurposed House Bill 436 to be exactly
 
05:52:34.628 --> 05:52:34.638 align:start position:0%
that the exact same thing this bill as
 
05:52:37.868 --> 05:52:37.878 align:start position:0%
modified to pay down the UN funded
 
05:52:40.868 --> 05:52:40.878 align:start position:0%
liability that bill is now on the other
 
05:52:43.430 --> 05:52:43.440 align:start position:0%
side of the wall and they have not yet
 
05:52:46.510 --> 05:52:46.520 align:start position:0%
acted on it I have high you know I've
 
05:52:48.468 --> 05:52:48.478 align:start position:0%
already spoken to them about it I have
 
05:52:52.190 --> 05:52:52.200 align:start position:0%
high hopes that that it may um go
 
05:52:56.310 --> 05:52:56.320 align:start position:0%
forward in some form the problem is we
 
05:53:00.910 --> 05:53:00.920 align:start position:0%
have already given them a very heavy
 
05:53:04.990 --> 05:53:05.000 align:start position:0%
lift on the general fund uh this year we
 
05:53:07.030 --> 05:53:07.040 align:start position:0%
have a much more important bill that
 
05:53:10.750 --> 05:53:10.760 align:start position:0%
we've already sent to um enhance group
 
05:53:12.468 --> 05:53:12.478 align:start position:0%
two liability
 
05:53:16.230 --> 05:53:16.240 align:start position:0%
features and we have House Bill 436
 
05:53:18.750 --> 05:53:18.760 align:start position:0%
which is the pay down of the unfunded
 
05:53:22.430 --> 05:53:22.440 align:start position:0%
liability if we add to it essentially
 
05:53:26.788 --> 05:53:26.798 align:start position:0%
the same bill in this bill that's yet
 
05:53:29.948 --> 05:53:29.958 align:start position:0%
another big chunk of the general funds
 
05:53:36.110 --> 05:53:36.120 align:start position:0%
and I think it will cause them to um to
 
05:53:37.708 --> 05:53:37.718 align:start position:0%
not pass
 
05:53:39.788 --> 05:53:39.798 align:start position:0%
our other important bills which we have
 
05:53:41.868 --> 05:53:41.878 align:start position:0%
already sent them you know it'll be just
 
05:53:45.708 --> 05:53:45.718 align:start position:0%
a too heavy of a lift um for their
 
05:53:48.110 --> 05:53:48.120 align:start position:0%
finance committee and it as it would be
 
05:53:52.190 --> 05:53:52.200 align:start position:0%
for ours so please let's honor the
 
05:53:55.230 --> 05:53:55.240 align:start position:0%
decision that this body has already
 
05:54:00.310 --> 05:54:00.320 align:start position:0%
made and um give our um our attention
 
05:54:04.708 --> 05:54:04.718 align:start position:0%
and our Force to lowering the unfunded
 
05:54:08.510 --> 05:54:08.520 align:start position:0%

05:56:28.270 --> 05:56:28.280 align:start position:0%
inquiry M thank you Mr Speaker Mr
 
05:56:31.110 --> 05:56:31.120 align:start position:0%
Speaker if I know that back in 1967 the
 
05:56:32.910 --> 05:56:32.920 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire promised
 
05:56:35.948 --> 05:56:35.958 align:start position:0%
communities a 40% share if they brought
 
05:56:38.190 --> 05:56:38.200 align:start position:0%
if they join the retirement system and
 
05:56:41.910 --> 05:56:41.920 align:start position:0%
if I know that in a strange quirk in
 
05:56:45.150 --> 05:56:45.160 align:start position:0%
2011 this house and the legislative body
 
05:56:48.070 --> 05:56:48.080 align:start position:0%
removed that contribution and it became
 
05:56:51.390 --> 05:56:51.400 align:start position:0%
a zero uh support for the
 
05:56:53.430 --> 05:56:53.440 align:start position:0%
communities and if I know that what goes
 
05:56:55.190 --> 05:56:55.200 align:start position:0%
on on the other side of the wall is
 
05:56:57.390 --> 05:56:57.400 align:start position:0%
their business and what happens on this
 
05:56:59.190 --> 05:56:59.200 align:start position:0%
side of the wall is our
 
05:57:02.190 --> 05:57:02.200 align:start position:0%
business and that this bill will be back
 
05:57:04.628 --> 05:57:04.638 align:start position:0%
again if we do not do this this year
 
05:57:06.548 --> 05:57:06.558 align:start position:0%
because our city councils our Board of
 
05:57:08.750 --> 05:57:08.760 align:start position:0%
Alderman our selectman have requested
 
05:57:12.350 --> 05:57:12.360 align:start position:0%
this year after year after year this is
 
05:57:14.910 --> 05:57:14.920 align:start position:0%
nonpartisan if I know that this s and a
 
05:57:17.670 --> 05:57:17.680 align:start position:0%
half% will make up for that will
 
05:57:19.110 --> 05:57:19.120 align:start position:0%
basically bring back some of that
 
05:57:21.548 --> 05:57:21.558 align:start position:0%
promise that we had for our communities
 
05:57:23.150 --> 05:57:23.160 align:start position:0%
and help reduce
 
05:57:25.788 --> 05:57:25.798 align:start position:0%
taxes would I now push the red button so
 
05:57:27.430 --> 05:57:27.440 align:start position:0%
that we can get to Art to pass and move
 
05:57:29.468 --> 05:57:29.478 align:start position:0%
this forward chair recognized
 
05:57:29.478 --> 05:57:35.270 align:start position:0%
this forward chair recognized
representative

05:57:35.270 --> 05:57:35.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:39.150 --> 05:57:39.160 align:start position:0%
wer thank you Mr Speaker if I know that
 
05:57:42.030 --> 05:57:42.040 align:start position:0%
in 2012 the lack of money going to the
 
05:57:43.868 --> 05:57:43.878 align:start position:0%
municipalities for the retirement
 
05:57:47.468 --> 05:57:47.478 align:start position:0%
contribution was made up by the task of
 
05:57:50.430 --> 05:57:50.440 align:start position:0%
making the employees pay the
 
05:57:52.868 --> 05:57:52.878 align:start position:0%
difference that system has been stable
 
05:57:56.310 --> 05:57:56.320 align:start position:0%
for 13 years and the employees are still
 
05:57:58.708 --> 05:57:58.718 align:start position:0%
paying about less than half of what the
 
05:58:01.590 --> 05:58:01.600 align:start position:0%
employer pays so if that system has been
 
05:58:04.390 --> 05:58:04.400 align:start position:0%
going on for 13 years why suddenly is
 
05:58:07.708 --> 05:58:07.718 align:start position:0%
there a travail about its effect on
 
05:58:10.230 --> 05:58:10.240 align:start position:0%
taxes and finally if I know that the
 
05:58:11.788 --> 05:58:11.798 align:start position:0%
Constitution Bill of Rights for New
 
05:58:14.468 --> 05:58:14.478 align:start position:0%
Hampshire in article 36 says pensions
 
05:58:16.590 --> 05:58:16.600 align:start position:0%
will never be paid for more than one
 
05:58:19.430 --> 05:58:19.440 align:start position:0%
year will I please stop hearing about
 
05:58:23.070 --> 05:58:23.080 align:start position:0%

06:02:05.230 --> 06:02:05.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:05.240 --> 06:02:07.270 align:start position:0%
 
Palmer

06:02:07.270 --> 06:02:07.280 align:start position:0%
Palmer
 
06:02:09.110 --> 06:02:09.120 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr
 
06:02:14.868 --> 06:02:14.878 align:start position:0%
Speaker I rise in opposition to HB 1280
 
06:02:18.708 --> 06:02:18.718 align:start position:0%
informed consent is a critical aspect of
 
06:02:21.830 --> 06:02:21.840 align:start position:0%
patient care and is integral to the
 
06:02:24.628 --> 06:02:24.638 align:start position:0%
physicians's code of context
 
06:02:27.150 --> 06:02:27.160 align:start position:0%
ethics however this bill would put into
 
06:02:30.070 --> 06:02:30.080 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's statute informed consent
 
06:02:32.590 --> 06:02:32.600 align:start position:0%
procedures and patient rights that are
 
06:02:35.070 --> 06:02:35.080 align:start position:0%
already in federal requirements through
 
06:02:37.468 --> 06:02:37.478 align:start position:0%
CMS which which establishes consent
 
06:02:40.150 --> 06:02:40.160 align:start position:0%
standards and provides enforcement
 
06:02:42.350 --> 06:02:42.360 align:start position:0%
mechanisms there are also accrediting
 
06:02:45.628 --> 06:02:45.638 align:start position:0%
bodies that dictate consent policies and
 
06:02:47.110 --> 06:02:47.120 align:start position:0%
we also have informed consent
 
06:02:52.708 --> 06:02:52.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:57.830 --> 06:02:57.840 align:start position:0%
15132 therefore hb280 is unnecessary at
 
06:03:01.070 --> 06:03:01.080 align:start position:0%
best this law could create additional
 
06:03:04.110 --> 06:03:04.120 align:start position:0%
regulations and possibly conflicts with
 
06:03:07.310 --> 06:03:07.320 align:start position:0%
federal laws and rules already in an
 
06:03:09.868 --> 06:03:09.878 align:start position:0%
already heavily regulated area of
 
06:03:12.430 --> 06:03:12.440 align:start position:0%
medicine the patient rights Provisions
 
06:03:14.590 --> 06:03:14.600 align:start position:0%
in this bill seem already to be covered
 
06:03:18.990 --> 06:03:19.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:21.830 --> 06:03:21.840 align:start position:0%
15121 most Physicians I've spoken to are
 
06:03:24.030 --> 06:03:24.040 align:start position:0%
concerned that this would add more
 
06:03:26.628 --> 06:03:26.638 align:start position:0%
administrative burden and would take
 
06:03:29.788 --> 06:03:29.798 align:start position:0%
time from direct patient care and agree
 
06:03:32.830 --> 06:03:32.840 align:start position:0%
that we should not codify medical
 
06:03:34.990 --> 06:03:35.000 align:start position:0%
practice this is an area where we should
 
06:03:37.468 --> 06:03:37.478 align:start position:0%
align with national standards and not
 
06:03:40.788 --> 06:03:40.798 align:start position:0%
make practice in New Hampshire more of a
 
06:03:43.990 --> 06:03:44.000 align:start position:0%
Minefield I already spend more time
 
06:03:47.990 --> 06:03:48.000 align:start position:0%
learning new rules in EMR operations and
 
06:03:51.310 --> 06:03:51.320 align:start position:0%
less and less time to update my actual
 
06:03:53.990 --> 06:03:54.000 align:start position:0%
medical knowledge if practice in New
 
06:03:55.430 --> 06:03:55.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire becomes harder than in
 
06:03:58.270 --> 06:03:58.280 align:start position:0%
surrounding states we will likely lose
 
06:04:00.628 --> 06:04:00.638 align:start position:0%
Physicians to those
 
06:04:03.628 --> 06:04:03.638 align:start position:0%
States finally I proposed I proposed
 
06:04:06.548 --> 06:04:06.558 align:start position:0%
interim study in the HS h chess
 
06:04:08.830 --> 06:04:08.840 align:start position:0%
committee because it was not clear to me
 
06:04:10.548 --> 06:04:10.558 align:start position:0%
that there was a significant
 
06:04:13.548 --> 06:04:13.558 align:start position:0%
problem that needed remediation and that
 
06:04:16.150 --> 06:04:16.160 align:start position:0%
we want Health Providers to be able to
 
06:04:19.270 --> 06:04:19.280 align:start position:0%
control how they meet current consent
 
06:04:22.868 --> 06:04:22.878 align:start position:0%
guidelines and not have a oniz fits all
 
06:04:25.990 --> 06:04:26.000 align:start position:0%
approached etched into law please oppose
 
06:04:28.430 --> 06:04:28.440 align:start position:0%
the OTP so we can move to interim study
 
06:04:31.310 --> 06:04:31.320 align:start position:0%
and find out if there's a real problem
 
06:04:35.030 --> 06:04:35.040 align:start position:0%
that warrants making a new law thank
 
06:04:35.040 --> 06:04:36.670 align:start position:0%
that warrants making a new law thank
you

06:04:36.670 --> 06:04:36.680 align:start position:0%
you
 
06:04:46.750 --> 06:04:46.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:51.150 --> 06:04:51.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:53.868 --> 06:04:53.878 align:start position:0%
Speaker Mr
 
06:04:57.110 --> 06:04:57.120 align:start position:0%
Speaker hb280 statutorily defines
 
06:04:59.628 --> 06:04:59.638 align:start position:0%
informed consent and patients rights in
 
06:05:01.670 --> 06:05:01.680 align:start position:0%
the context of a doctor patient
 
06:05:03.510 --> 06:05:03.520 align:start position:0%
relationship and the language of the
 
06:05:06.150 --> 06:05:06.160 align:start position:0%
bill draws directly from the AMA
 
06:05:09.110 --> 06:05:09.120 align:start position:0%
guidelines and codifies the minimum the
 
06:05:11.708 --> 06:05:11.718 align:start position:0%
minimum best practices in the delivery
 
06:05:14.350 --> 06:05:14.360 align:start position:0%
of healthc care as a result many on the
 
06:05:16.350 --> 06:05:16.360 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services committee felt
 
06:05:19.190 --> 06:05:19.200 align:start position:0%
that this was a very light lift and it
 
06:05:21.628 --> 06:05:21.638 align:start position:0%
result in a very mild burden for those
 
06:05:24.910 --> 06:05:24.920 align:start position:0%
working in the health care sector now as
 
06:05:26.670 --> 06:05:26.680 align:start position:0%
if to reinforce that position the
 
06:05:28.708 --> 06:05:28.718 align:start position:0%
opposing committee report stated that
 
06:05:31.390 --> 06:05:31.400 align:start position:0%
and I quote the bill would put in the
 
06:05:33.590 --> 06:05:33.600 align:start position:0%
statute inform Consin procedures and
 
06:05:36.030 --> 06:05:36.040 align:start position:0%
patient rights that are already stand
 
06:05:38.390 --> 06:05:38.400 align:start position:0%
standard practice in New Hampshire and
 
06:05:41.830 --> 06:05:41.840 align:start position:0%
in the nation so already standard
 
06:05:44.070 --> 06:05:44.080 align:start position:0%
practice apparently the two sides on
 
06:05:45.830 --> 06:05:45.840 align:start position:0%
this bill already agreed on some stuff
 
06:05:47.430 --> 06:05:47.440 align:start position:0%
and and that's a good beginning that I
 
06:05:49.590 --> 06:05:49.600 align:start position:0%
can work with but where the two sides
 
06:05:51.670 --> 06:05:51.680 align:start position:0%
differed was on the need to put these
 
06:05:55.230 --> 06:05:55.240 align:start position:0%
practices into statute the opposing side
 
06:05:56.948 --> 06:05:56.958 align:start position:0%
felt that while the language is in line
 
06:05:59.468 --> 06:05:59.478 align:start position:0%
with ideal Medical Practice things like
 
06:06:01.190 --> 06:06:01.200 align:start position:0%
assessing a patient ability to
 
06:06:02.628 --> 06:06:02.638 align:start position:0%
understand their treatment is an
 
06:06:04.750 --> 06:06:04.760 align:start position:0%
immeasurable burden that will increase
 
06:06:07.430 --> 06:06:07.440 align:start position:0%
liability concerns and cast a shadow on
 
06:06:09.310 --> 06:06:09.320 align:start position:0%
recruitment to the medical profession if
 
06:06:11.150 --> 06:06:11.160 align:start position:0%
it was passed into
 
06:06:13.510 --> 06:06:13.520 align:start position:0%
law and this is where I personally
 
06:06:16.230 --> 06:06:16.240 align:start position:0%
separate myself from the other side in
 
06:06:19.910 --> 06:06:19.920 align:start position:0%
my opinion there can be no true consent
 
06:06:22.150 --> 06:06:22.160 align:start position:0%
without understanding and the
 
06:06:24.310 --> 06:06:24.320 align:start position:0%
requirement to assess a patient's
 
06:06:27.868 --> 06:06:27.878 align:start position:0%
ability to understand is fundamental
 
06:06:31.788 --> 06:06:31.798 align:start position:0%
there can be no consent without it but
 
06:06:33.510 --> 06:06:33.520 align:start position:0%
this bill isn't needed because doctors
 
06:06:35.310 --> 06:06:35.320 align:start position:0%
don't want to provide informed consent
 
06:06:38.110 --> 06:06:38.120 align:start position:0%
or good followup care the fact is that
 
06:06:40.030 --> 06:06:40.040 align:start position:0%
those who enter into the medical field
 
06:06:41.990 --> 06:06:42.000 align:start position:0%
have always been some of the most caring
 
06:06:44.070 --> 06:06:44.080 align:start position:0%
and dedicated Professionals in the whole
 
06:06:46.910 --> 06:06:46.920 align:start position:0%
of our society of course they want to
 
06:06:48.948 --> 06:06:48.958 align:start position:0%
provide these things to their patients
 
06:06:51.750 --> 06:06:51.760 align:start position:0%
and they're not the problem no the bill
 
06:06:54.468 --> 06:06:54.478 align:start position:0%
is needed because in the last 30 years
 
06:06:56.310 --> 06:06:56.320 align:start position:0%
an enormous administrative
 
06:06:58.670 --> 06:06:58.680 align:start position:0%
infrastructure has grown up around
 
06:07:00.910 --> 06:07:00.920 align:start position:0%
healthc care that wants to turn
 
06:07:03.868 --> 06:07:03.878 align:start position:0%
everything into a process and then lean
 
06:07:06.510 --> 06:07:06.520 align:start position:0%
it out and my friends that that can work
 
06:07:08.430 --> 06:07:08.440 align:start position:0%
with a lot of things but one of the
 
06:07:10.310 --> 06:07:10.320 align:start position:0%
things it can't work with is a
 
06:07:12.830 --> 06:07:12.840 align:start position:0%
conversation between a doctor and a
 
06:07:14.628 --> 06:07:14.638 align:start position:0%
patient and the final result of this
 
06:07:16.868 --> 06:07:16.878 align:start position:0%
approach is that the best practices that
 
06:07:19.628 --> 06:07:19.638 align:start position:0%
both sides agree upon are often being
 
06:07:22.430 --> 06:07:22.440 align:start position:0%
executed in a perfunctory manner in
 
06:07:25.030 --> 06:07:25.040 align:start position:0%
order to just check a box and that's not
 
06:07:27.548 --> 06:07:27.558 align:start position:0%
only strangling patients it's strangling
 
06:07:30.070 --> 06:07:30.080 align:start position:0%
doctors as well and there needs to be a
 
06:07:34.350 --> 06:07:34.360 align:start position:0%
break on it so as such this bill is
 
06:07:37.030 --> 06:07:37.040 align:start position:0%
actually a tool for patients to demand
 
06:07:40.110 --> 06:07:40.120 align:start position:0%
more than a perfunctory review and for
 
06:07:42.788 --> 06:07:42.798 align:start position:0%
doctors to push back against an
 
06:07:44.310 --> 06:07:44.320 align:start position:0%
Administration that might have lost
 
06:07:47.708 --> 06:07:47.718 align:start position:0%
sight of the core mission that they
 
06:07:49.948 --> 06:07:49.958 align:start position:0%
serve so the opponents of the bill will
 
06:07:51.670 --> 06:07:51.680 align:start position:0%
say they're always looking to improve
 
06:07:54.030 --> 06:07:54.040 align:start position:0%
consent and as such there's no need to
 
06:07:56.628 --> 06:07:56.638 align:start position:0%
put these practices in the statute well
 
06:07:59.548 --> 06:07:59.558 align:start position:0%
okay but the question is how well has
 
06:08:01.548 --> 06:08:01.558 align:start position:0%
that been working and to me the answer
 
06:08:04.868 --> 06:08:04.878 align:start position:0%
is not very well the fact is that while
 
06:08:06.430 --> 06:08:06.440 align:start position:0%
there are plenty of incent Ines for
 
06:08:08.948 --> 06:08:08.958 align:start position:0%
patients and doctors to seek reform
 
06:08:12.350 --> 06:08:12.360 align:start position:0%
those incentives just don't carry over
 
06:08:14.070 --> 06:08:14.080 align:start position:0%
to the administrative elements of the
 
06:08:16.468 --> 06:08:16.478 align:start position:0%
Health Care system so I really think
 
06:08:18.750 --> 06:08:18.760 align:start position:0%
we're just now at a place where we need
 
06:08:21.708 --> 06:08:21.718 align:start position:0%
to have an external statutory bump if
 
06:08:23.788 --> 06:08:23.798 align:start position:0%
you truly want to shift the
 
06:08:27.430 --> 06:08:27.440 align:start position:0%
trajectory so everyone in this Hall has
 
06:08:31.070 --> 06:08:31.080 align:start position:0%
been a patient at one time or another so
 
06:08:33.548 --> 06:08:33.558 align:start position:0%
I want all of you who are old enough to
 
06:08:36.948 --> 06:08:36.958 align:start position:0%
think on this look back on the
 
06:08:39.590 --> 06:08:39.600 align:start position:0%
conversations relationships and the
 
06:08:43.070 --> 06:08:43.080 align:start position:0%
follow-up care that you had 30 years ago
 
06:08:46.190 --> 06:08:46.200 align:start position:0%
and compare it to the kind of
 
06:08:48.190 --> 06:08:48.200 align:start position:0%
relationships and discussions that
 
06:08:50.548 --> 06:08:50.558 align:start position:0%
you're having today and if you think
 
06:08:53.548 --> 06:08:53.558 align:start position:0%
it's better now then by all means feel
 
06:08:56.390 --> 06:08:56.400 align:start position:0%
free to oppose this bill but if you feel
 
06:08:58.830 --> 06:08:58.840 align:start position:0%
like me that we're losing something
 
06:09:01.190 --> 06:09:01.200 align:start position:0%
really important in healthcare as we
 
06:09:03.430 --> 06:09:03.440 align:start position:0%
perpetually try to lean it out I hope
 
06:09:04.990 --> 06:09:05.000 align:start position:0%
you'll join with me in supporting this
 
06:09:09.510 --> 06:09:09.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:12.150 --> 06:09:12.160 align:start position:0%
Speaker the motion before us is ought to
 
06:09:15.270 --> 06:09:15.280 align:start position:0%
pass on House Bill 1280 who requested
 
06:09:16.270 --> 06:09:16.280 align:start position:0%

06:10:38.350 --> 06:10:38.360 align:start position:0%
inquiry thank you Mr speaker Mr Speaker
 
06:10:40.990 --> 06:10:41.000 align:start position:0%
if I know in those dear dead nostalgic
 
06:10:44.548 --> 06:10:44.558 align:start position:0%
days I asked my health care provider one
 
06:10:47.750 --> 06:10:47.760 align:start position:0%
question and his answer to me was if you
 
06:10:50.190 --> 06:10:50.200 align:start position:0%
want me to teach you medicine my fee is
 
06:10:51.948 --> 06:10:51.958 align:start position:0%
a million dollars a
 
06:10:54.670 --> 06:10:54.680 align:start position:0%
minute and if I know we've progressed a
 
06:10:56.590 --> 06:10:56.600 align:start position:0%
long way since
 
06:10:59.990 --> 06:11:00.000 align:start position:0%
then but if I know that this bill does
 
06:11:03.948 --> 06:11:03.958 align:start position:0%
not promote greater understanding it
 
06:11:06.548 --> 06:11:06.558 align:start position:0%
just adds to the process and the
 
06:11:09.788 --> 06:11:09.798 align:start position:0%
paperwork and therefore takes away from
 
06:11:09.798 --> 06:11:11.230 align:start position:0%
paperwork and therefore takes away from
patient

06:11:11.230 --> 06:11:11.240 align:start position:0%
patient
 
06:11:15.070 --> 06:11:15.080 align:start position:0%
care and if I know that informed consent
 
06:11:19.030 --> 06:11:19.040 align:start position:0%
is not a oniz fits
 
06:11:22.750 --> 06:11:22.760 align:start position:0%
all uh operation because every process
 
06:11:25.628 --> 06:11:25.638 align:start position:0%
is different and requires a different
 
06:11:26.948 --> 06:11:26.958 align:start position:0%
sort of
 
06:11:30.030 --> 06:11:30.040 align:start position:0%
explanation would I now press the red
 
06:11:32.190 --> 06:11:32.200 align:start position:0%

inquiry thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker
 
06:11:43.708 --> 06:11:43.718 align:start position:0%
if I know that the requirements laid out
 
06:11:46.548 --> 06:11:46.558 align:start position:0%
in hp1 1280 are pulled directly from the
 
06:11:48.150 --> 06:11:48.160 align:start position:0%
American Medical association's
 
06:11:50.590 --> 06:11:50.600 align:start position:0%
guidelines for best practice and if I
 
06:11:53.110 --> 06:11:53.120 align:start position:0%
noted in the last few decades a huge
 
06:11:55.070 --> 06:11:55.080 align:start position:0%
administrative infrastructure has grown
 
06:11:57.190 --> 06:11:57.200 align:start position:0%
up around Healthcare that needs to be
 
06:11:59.230 --> 06:11:59.240 align:start position:0%
addressed if we want to see these best
 
06:12:01.548 --> 06:12:01.558 align:start position:0%
practices carried out in fact and not
 
06:12:03.948 --> 06:12:03.958 align:start position:0%
just on paper and if I know that this
 
06:12:06.270 --> 06:12:06.280 align:start position:0%
bill gives the needed statutory push to
 
06:12:08.230 --> 06:12:08.240 align:start position:0%
shift the health care sector into
 
06:12:10.190 --> 06:12:10.200 align:start position:0%
greater alignment with these practices
 
06:12:12.150 --> 06:12:12.160 align:start position:0%

updating if I know that with the

increased use of illegal drugs that we
 
06:23:42.310 --> 06:23:42.320 align:start position:0%

the responsibility of raising this

else some parents who surrender their

no hero she wants to surrender the baby

for one

reason because it would be in her own

self-interest to be free of this
 
06:26:36.868 --> 06:26:36.878 align:start position:0%
child but it is ultimately in the best
 
06:26:39.910 --> 06:26:39.920 align:start position:0%
interest of the baby to allow an option

her baby to a New Hampshire hospital in

a Litany of other crimes in other words
 
06:27:05.230 --> 06:27:05.240 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's Safe Haven law was used
 
06:27:08.110 --> 06:27:08.120 align:start position:0%
as a law enforcement
 
06:27:11.030 --> 06:27:11.040 align:start position:0%
tool we need to update our safe haven
 
06:27:12.788 --> 06:27:12.798 align:start position:0%
law so mothers know that they can
 
06:27:17.150 --> 06:27:17.160 align:start position:0%
surrender their baby free from fear of
 
06:27:19.948 --> 06:27:19.958 align:start position:0%
arrest if a mother realizes that by
 
06:27:22.510 --> 06:27:22.520 align:start position:0%
safely surrendering her baby the
 
06:27:24.788 --> 06:27:24.798 align:start position:0%
hospital will report her identity to the
 
06:27:27.628 --> 06:27:27.638 align:start position:0%
police who then pursue and investigate
 
06:27:30.948 --> 06:27:30.958 align:start position:0%
her she may not come forward to
 
06:27:32.390 --> 06:27:32.400 align:start position:0%
surrender her
 
06:27:37.430 --> 06:27:37.440 align:start position:0%
baby instead she might keep the baby out

06:27:45.510 --> 06:27:45.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:27:48.030 --> 06:27:48.040 align:start position:0%
baby we know what will
 
06:27:50.868 --> 06:27:50.878 align:start position:0%
happen as long as our safe havens are
 
06:27:53.270 --> 06:27:53.280 align:start position:0%
used as a tool of law enforcement to
 
06:27:56.070 --> 06:27:56.080 align:start position:0%
catch criminal parents then that baby
 
06:28:00.750 --> 06:28:00.760 align:start position:0%
might die be neglected or like Doan's

of the issues we consider in this

another state with better safe haven
 
06:28:27.628 --> 06:28:27.638 align:start position:0%

06:28:30.750 --> 06:28:30.760 align:start position:0%
incentive to save these
 
06:28:33.868 --> 06:28:33.878 align:start position:0%
babies this bill will expand expand the
 
06:28:35.590 --> 06:28:35.600 align:start position:0%
age window in which parents can
 
06:28:37.948 --> 06:28:37.958 align:start position:0%
surrender their child and allow the

of their
 
06:28:47.110 --> 06:28:47.120 align:start position:0%
parents as the New Hampshire Association
 
06:28:49.350 --> 06:28:49.360 align:start position:0%
of criminal defense attorneys has
 
06:28:51.788 --> 06:28:51.798 align:start position:0%
explained this is no different from
 
06:28:54.310 --> 06:28:54.320 align:start position:0%
other areas where we restrict the tools
 
06:28:56.230 --> 06:28:56.240 align:start position:0%
that law enforcement can
 
06:28:59.590 --> 06:28:59.600 align:start position:0%
use our laws exclude evidence obtained
 
06:29:02.110 --> 06:29:02.120 align:start position:0%
from illegal searches but this does not
 
06:29:05.150 --> 06:29:05.160 align:start position:0%
mean we want criminals to go free
 
06:29:08.468 --> 06:29:08.478 align:start position:0%
it means the police must use other tools
 
06:29:11.310 --> 06:29:11.320 align:start position:0%
not illegal searches to catch those
 
06:29:14.628 --> 06:29:14.638 align:start position:0%
criminals in the same way police must
 
06:29:16.948 --> 06:29:16.958 align:start position:0%
use other tools to catch
 
06:29:20.750 --> 06:29:20.760 align:start position:0%
criminals besides baby safe
 
06:29:23.788 --> 06:29:23.798 align:start position:0%
havens what is more
 
06:29:26.390 --> 06:29:26.400 align:start position:0%
critical punishing

report thank you Mr
 
06:30:05.708 --> 06:30:05.718 align:start position:0%
Speaker so you've heard heard a number
 
06:30:08.830 --> 06:30:08.840 align:start position:0%
of most excellent points in favor of
 
06:30:08.840 --> 06:30:09.910 align:start position:0%
of most excellent points in favor of
this

06:30:09.910 --> 06:30:09.920 align:start position:0%
this
 
06:30:14.350 --> 06:30:14.360 align:start position:0%
bill and I understand all of those
 
06:30:17.948 --> 06:30:17.958 align:start position:0%
arguments and I agree with them but
 
06:30:20.150 --> 06:30:20.160 align:start position:0%
there's another side as well so let's
 
06:30:22.110 --> 06:30:22.120 align:start position:0%
look at the
 
06:30:25.830 --> 06:30:25.840 align:start position:0%
bill currently anybody can surrender a
 
06:30:29.270 --> 06:30:29.280 align:start position:0%
baby within five days of birth by giving
 
06:30:34.430 --> 06:30:34.440 align:start position:0%
a warm handoff to a hospital EMT fire
 
06:30:40.270 --> 06:30:40.280 align:start position:0%
fire station police station a church
 
06:30:43.270 --> 06:30:43.280 align:start position:0%
whatever the bill would change that to
 
06:30:46.990 --> 06:30:47.000 align:start position:0%
61 days for
 
06:30:50.030 --> 06:30:50.040 align:start position:0%
surrender and it
 
06:30:54.990 --> 06:30:55.000 align:start position:0%
has the anonymous use of the baby
 
06:30:59.150 --> 06:30:59.160 align:start position:0%
box as a protection and an
 
06:31:02.628 --> 06:31:02.638 align:start position:0%
incentive for the parent to surrender
 
06:31:06.670 --> 06:31:06.680 align:start position:0%
the child anonymous ly and I understand
 
06:31:09.548 --> 06:31:09.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:31:13.388 --> 06:31:13.398 align:start position:0%
arguments but here is the other side of
 
06:31:13.398 --> 06:31:14.560 align:start position:0%
arguments but here is the other side of
the

06:31:14.560 --> 06:31:14.570 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:31:14.570 --> 06:31:16.070 align:start position:0%
the

[Music]
 
06:31:18.510 --> 06:31:18.520 align:start position:0%
question oh and and the third thing is
 
06:31:20.628 --> 06:31:20.638 align:start position:0%
that of course it limits the liability
 
06:31:22.948 --> 06:31:22.958 align:start position:0%
to prosecution either civil or
 
06:31:25.548 --> 06:31:25.558 align:start position:0%
criminally for acting under the
 
06:31:28.190 --> 06:31:28.200 align:start position:0%
act so here's the other side of the
 
06:31:29.990 --> 06:31:30.000 align:start position:0%
question first
 
06:31:36.110 --> 06:31:36.120 align:start position:0%
off somebody who is so
 
06:31:39.388 --> 06:31:39.398 align:start position:0%
deep in the depths of addiction or
 
06:31:41.868 --> 06:31:41.878 align:start position:0%
poverty or mental
 
06:31:44.070 --> 06:31:44.080 align:start position:0%
illness that they
 
06:31:48.510 --> 06:31:48.520 align:start position:0%
are considering surrendering a baby may
 
06:31:51.708 --> 06:31:51.718 align:start position:0%
not even know that this law exists may
 
06:31:54.388 --> 06:31:54.398 align:start position:0%
not know it's available to
 
06:31:57.990 --> 06:31:58.000 align:start position:0%
them and may not be organized enough to
 
06:32:00.070 --> 06:32:00.080 align:start position:0%
take advantage of the
 
06:32:03.310 --> 06:32:03.320 align:start position:0%
law and that is a
 
06:32:03.320 --> 06:32:54.930 align:start position:0%
law and that is a
tragedy

06:32:54.930 --> 06:32:54.940 align:start position:0%
 
06:32:54.940 --> 06:33:04.750 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

06:33:04.750 --> 06:33:04.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:33:08.468 --> 06:33:08.478 align:start position:0%
of these devices who made it very clear
 
06:33:10.190 --> 06:33:10.200 align:start position:0%
that he was making it his mission in
 
06:33:13.510 --> 06:33:13.520 align:start position:0%
life to change all the laws in all the
 
06:33:15.910 --> 06:33:15.920 align:start position:0%
states and yes there's nothing that
 
06:33:19.788 --> 06:33:19.798 align:start position:0%
requires that his devices be used but
 
06:33:21.788 --> 06:33:21.798 align:start position:0%
he's the only person who's doing it at
 
06:33:21.798 --> 06:33:23.230 align:start position:0%
he's the only person who's doing it at
the

06:33:23.230 --> 06:33:23.240 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:33:26.708 --> 06:33:26.718 align:start position:0%
moment finally there is that thorny
 
06:33:29.030 --> 06:33:29.040 align:start position:0%
issue of
 
06:33:32.230 --> 06:33:32.240 align:start position:0%
liability if this bill
 
06:33:37.270 --> 06:33:37.280 align:start position:0%
passes there is the very very real
 
06:33:39.830 --> 06:33:39.840 align:start position:0%
possibility that
 
06:33:41.868 --> 06:33:41.878 align:start position:0%
someone not
 
06:33:44.190 --> 06:33:44.200 align:start position:0%
necessarily the
 
06:33:48.190 --> 06:33:48.200 align:start position:0%
mother could be abusing a
 
06:33:51.830 --> 06:33:51.840 align:start position:0%
child for 60
 
06:33:55.830 --> 06:33:55.840 align:start position:0%
days and then could possibly put that
 
06:34:01.430 --> 06:34:01.440 align:start position:0%
comos and battered infant into a box and
 
06:34:06.708 --> 06:34:06.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:34:09.670 --> 06:34:09.680 align:start position:0%
and imagine the howls from our
 
06:34:12.830 --> 06:34:12.840 align:start position:0%
constituents if that
 
06:34:16.590 --> 06:34:16.600 align:start position:0%
happens there is a great deal to admire
 
06:34:18.430 --> 06:34:18.440 align:start position:0%
about this
 
06:34:20.830 --> 06:34:20.840 align:start position:0%
legislation uh there's a great deal to
 
06:34:23.110 --> 06:34:23.120 align:start position:0%
be worked on in this
 
06:34:25.548 --> 06:34:25.558 align:start position:0%
legislation so I would urge you to
 
06:34:28.590 --> 06:34:28.600 align:start position:0%
support the interim study so we can
 
06:34:31.830 --> 06:34:31.840 align:start position:0%
continue to work on the bill and bring
 
06:34:34.948 --> 06:34:34.958 align:start position:0%
back a better product with more more of
 
06:34:38.510 --> 06:34:38.520 align:start position:0%

inquiry

06:36:42.830 --> 06:36:42.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:36:45.270 --> 06:36:45.280 align:start position:0%

inquiry thank you Mr
 
06:37:04.510 --> 06:37:04.520 align:start position:0%
Speaker if I know that safe haven box
 
06:37:08.388 --> 06:37:08.398 align:start position:0%
are being used in 16 other states and
 
06:37:11.030 --> 06:37:11.040 align:start position:0%
that we want to lead New England in
 
06:37:11.040 --> 06:37:12.150 align:start position:0%
that we want to lead New England in
child

06:37:12.150 --> 06:37:12.160 align:start position:0%
child
 
06:37:14.830 --> 06:37:14.840 align:start position:0%
protections and if I know that evidence
 
06:37:17.548 --> 06:37:17.558 align:start position:0%
can be obtained in ways other than from
 
06:37:20.230 --> 06:37:20.240 align:start position:0%
the surrender of the child and that the
 
06:37:22.430 --> 06:37:22.440 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Association of criminal
 
06:37:24.270 --> 06:37:24.280 align:start position:0%
defense law supports the
 
06:37:28.110 --> 06:37:28.120 align:start position:0%
bill and I also know that there was no
 
06:37:30.750 --> 06:37:30.760 align:start position:0%
manufacturer at the hearing because I
 
06:37:33.030 --> 06:37:33.040 align:start position:0%
was there and they were not doing an
 
06:37:36.430 --> 06:37:36.440 align:start position:0%
infomercial and lastly if I know this
 
06:37:39.468 --> 06:37:39.478 align:start position:0%
bill has bipartisan sponsorship and
 
06:37:39.478 --> 06:37:41.510 align:start position:0%
bill has bipartisan sponsorship and
committee

06:37:41.510 --> 06:37:41.520 align:start position:0%
committee
 
06:37:45.670 --> 06:37:45.680 align:start position:0%
support and that saving a baby's life
 
06:37:48.910 --> 06:37:48.920 align:start position:0%
should take precedence over
 
06:37:51.430 --> 06:37:51.440 align:start position:0%
Prosecuting a struggling
 
06:37:54.190 --> 06:37:54.200 align:start position:0%

infants and if I

06:38:21.430 --> 06:38:21.440 align:start position:0%
know I let a lot of stuff slide but just
 
06:38:23.590 --> 06:38:23.600 align:start position:0%
for once can remember who we are where
 
06:38:25.430 --> 06:38:25.440 align:start position:0%
we are and give the subject matter the
 
06:38:28.628 --> 06:38:28.638 align:start position:0%

Speaker and if I know that I want to
 
06:38:38.350 --> 06:38:38.360 align:start position:0%
protect a suffering mother or
 
06:38:42.230 --> 06:38:42.240 align:start position:0%
parent but I don't want to protect an
 
06:38:42.240 --> 06:38:44.788 align:start position:0%
parent but I don't want to protect an
abusive

06:38:44.788 --> 06:38:44.798 align:start position:0%
abusive
 
06:38:47.750 --> 06:38:47.760 align:start position:0%
person and if I know that you can't have
 
06:38:52.310 --> 06:38:52.320 align:start position:0%
it both ways you can't say that this
 
06:38:54.948 --> 06:38:54.958 align:start position:0%
bill will allow people to go free and
 
06:38:57.788 --> 06:38:57.798 align:start position:0%
clear so they of course will adopt this
 
06:39:01.270 --> 06:39:01.280 align:start position:0%
procedure and also argue that they can
 
06:39:05.708 --> 06:39:05.718 align:start position:0%
also be uh brought to answer for their
 
06:39:08.350 --> 06:39:08.360 align:start position:0%
actions in other
 
06:39:12.270 --> 06:39:12.280 align:start position:0%
ways would I now vote green to support
 
06:39:15.548 --> 06:39:15.558 align:start position:0%

06:39:18.070 --> 06:39:18.080 align:start position:0%

06:42:45.230 --> 06:42:45.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:42:47.070 --> 06:42:47.080 align:start position:0%
all right now the question is on the
 
06:42:50.670 --> 06:42:50.680 align:start position:0%
main motion of to pass as amended
 
06:42:52.670 --> 06:42:52.680 align:start position:0%
representative Seth Kings recognized to
 
06:42:56.230 --> 06:42:56.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:42:59.708 --> 06:42:59.718 align:start position:0%
motion thank you Mr Speaker friends I
 
06:43:00.948 --> 06:43:00.958 align:start position:0%
have something very important to say
 
06:43:03.868 --> 06:43:03.878 align:start position:0%
here this bill um I really like the
 
06:43:05.830 --> 06:43:05.840 align:start position:0%
majority of this bill I like the baby
 
06:43:08.468 --> 06:43:08.478 align:start position:0%
boxes I liked the increasing the number
 
06:43:11.670 --> 06:43:11.680 align:start position:0%
of days and that had bipartisan support
 
06:43:13.868 --> 06:43:13.878 align:start position:0%
the main problem is with a very small
 
06:43:15.708 --> 06:43:15.718 align:start position:0%
section of the bill which is referred to
 
06:43:18.590 --> 06:43:18.600 align:start position:0%
as the exclusionary clause and what this
 
06:43:22.430 --> 06:43:22.440 align:start position:0%
does is it allows individuals to abuse
 
06:43:24.708 --> 06:43:24.718 align:start position:0%
including sexually abusing children for
 
06:43:27.590 --> 06:43:27.600 align:start position:0%
up to 61 days drop them off and have a
 
06:43:30.110 --> 06:43:30.120 align:start position:0%
get out of jail free card that is a
 
06:43:32.788 --> 06:43:32.798 align:start position:0%
bridge too far for me okay and when I
 
06:43:34.868 --> 06:43:34.878 align:start position:0%
brought this up in commit committee we
 
06:43:37.110 --> 06:43:37.120 align:start position:0%
had enough support including on the
 
06:43:38.628 --> 06:43:38.638 align:start position:0%
Republican side to say you know what
 
06:43:40.110 --> 06:43:40.120 align:start position:0%
that's also a bridge too far from me as
 
06:43:42.310 --> 06:43:42.320 align:start position:0%
well that's why we originally supported
 
06:43:44.030 --> 06:43:44.040 align:start position:0%
the interim study
 
06:43:46.590 --> 06:43:46.600 align:start position:0%
bill the problem is in the last minute
 
06:43:48.708 --> 06:43:48.718 align:start position:0%
leadership has decided to switch around
 
06:43:50.670 --> 06:43:50.680 align:start position:0%
and say no we want to fight for the bill
 
06:43:52.990 --> 06:43:53.000 align:start position:0%
completely let me ask you a
 
06:43:55.548 --> 06:43:55.558 align:start position:0%
question if somebody kidnapped a child
 
06:43:57.628 --> 06:43:57.638 align:start position:0%
right now and the child was missing for
 
06:43:59.990 --> 06:44:00.000 align:start position:0%
three weeks would the police ever come
 
06:44:02.070 --> 06:44:02.080 align:start position:0%
out on the media and say you know what
 
06:44:04.150 --> 06:44:04.160 align:start position:0%
just bring back the child we don't care
 
06:44:05.510 --> 06:44:05.520 align:start position:0%
what you've done to it in the last 3
 
06:44:07.910 --> 06:44:07.920 align:start position:0%
weeks we will let you off scottf free
 
06:44:09.548 --> 06:44:09.558 align:start position:0%
would we would we ever do that no they
 
06:44:11.548 --> 06:44:11.558 align:start position:0%
wouldn't they would never do that we
 
06:44:13.990 --> 06:44:14.000 align:start position:0%
will prosecute you to the fullest extent
 
06:44:16.070 --> 06:44:16.080 align:start position:0%
of the law we cannot tolerate child
 
06:44:18.388 --> 06:44:18.398 align:start position:0%
abusers and the problem is that if you
 
06:44:20.070 --> 06:44:20.080 align:start position:0%
ever were to say something like this you
 
06:44:22.270 --> 06:44:22.280 align:start position:0%
would give it would be a Clarion call to
 
06:44:24.388 --> 06:44:24.398 align:start position:0%
all of the wouldbe abusers out there all
 
06:44:27.070 --> 06:44:27.080 align:start position:0%
you have to do is bring back the
 
06:44:29.750 --> 06:44:29.760 align:start position:0%
child and we'll let you off Scot Freak
 
06:44:33.270 --> 06:44:33.280 align:start position:0%
No matter what you've done to it so what
 
06:44:36.030 --> 06:44:36.040 align:start position:0%
I recommend is to not support the OTP
 
06:44:38.750 --> 06:44:38.760 align:start position:0%
it's very unfortunate because uh me and
 
06:44:40.310 --> 06:44:40.320 align:start position:0%
some other Representatives worked very
 
06:44:42.350 --> 06:44:42.360 align:start position:0%
hard with the authors of the bill and we
 
06:44:44.110 --> 06:44:44.120 align:start position:0%
said hey let's have a compromise here
 
06:44:45.948 --> 06:44:45.958 align:start position:0%
I'm perfectly fine we were perfectly
 
06:44:48.350 --> 06:44:48.360 align:start position:0%
fine with saying look if you're drug
 
06:44:50.310 --> 06:44:50.320 align:start position:0%
addicted then we're not going to come
 
06:44:52.548 --> 06:44:52.558 align:start position:0%
after you all right I've been against
 
06:44:54.468 --> 06:44:54.478 align:start position:0%
the War on Drugs my entire life I don't
 
06:44:57.150 --> 06:44:57.160 align:start position:0%
want a drug addicted mother to Fe to be
 
06:44:59.110 --> 06:44:59.120 align:start position:0%
afraid of dropping off her baby and then
 
06:45:01.030 --> 06:45:01.040 align:start position:0%
getting busted that that is not what I
 
06:45:03.468 --> 06:45:03.478 align:start position:0%
want but if you are sexually abused
 
06:45:05.190 --> 06:45:05.200 align:start position:0%
losing children if you are breaking
 
06:45:08.350 --> 06:45:08.360 align:start position:0%
their bones and brutalizing them we will
 
06:45:09.910 --> 06:45:09.920 align:start position:0%
come after you with the fullest extent
 
06:45:11.868 --> 06:45:11.878 align:start position:0%
of the law we cannot tolerate that and
 
06:45:13.270 --> 06:45:13.280 align:start position:0%
the problem is this sends the wrong
 
06:45:14.350 --> 06:45:14.360 align:start position:0%
message and we're going to send a
 
06:45:15.990 --> 06:45:16.000 align:start position:0%
Clarion call to everybody out there who
 
06:45:18.310 --> 06:45:18.320 align:start position:0%
is a wouldbe abuser you have 61 days
 
06:45:19.670 --> 06:45:19.680 align:start position:0%
matter of fact there was a bit there was
 
06:45:22.070 --> 06:45:22.080 align:start position:0%
a um there just a couple of days ago
 
06:45:24.868 --> 06:45:24.878 align:start position:0%
there was a mother who was found uh who
 
06:45:26.910 --> 06:45:26.920 align:start position:0%
was busted for pimping out her newborn
 
06:45:29.190 --> 06:45:29.200 align:start position:0%
child to sexual predators there is real
 
06:45:30.708 --> 06:45:30.718 align:start position:0%
evil in the world people will take
 
06:45:32.670 --> 06:45:32.680 align:start position:0%
advantage of this and I don't want my
 
06:45:35.270 --> 06:45:35.280 align:start position:0%
hands on this bill at all so I would say
 
06:45:37.548 --> 06:45:37.558 align:start position:0%
please send the bill back let's fix that
 
06:45:39.590 --> 06:45:39.600 align:start position:0%
we need some compromise we can't just
 
06:45:41.670 --> 06:45:41.680 align:start position:0%
have a we cannot just have a
 
06:45:43.910 --> 06:45:43.920 align:start position:0%
free-for-all that is unacceptable and as
 
06:45:45.590 --> 06:45:45.600 align:start position:0%

you representa Pell's recognized speak
 
06:45:54.388 --> 06:45:54.398 align:start position:0%
 
06:45:56.590 --> 06:45:56.600 align:start position:0%
motion thank you Mr
 
06:46:00.628 --> 06:46:00.638 align:start position:0%
Speaker this bill provides a requirement
 
06:46:02.788 --> 06:46:02.798 align:start position:0%
that within 24 hours of receiving a
 
06:46:05.388 --> 06:46:05.398 align:start position:0%
report the department shall request law
 
06:46:07.468 --> 06:46:07.478 align:start position:0%
enforcement officials to investigate the
 
06:46:09.750 --> 06:46:09.760 align:start position:0%
incident including by using the National
 
06:46:12.150 --> 06:46:12.160 align:start position:0%
Crime information center database to
 
06:46:14.750 --> 06:46:14.760 align:start position:0%
determine if the child is missing and as
 
06:46:16.948 --> 06:46:16.958 align:start position:0%
for the exclusionary rule this uses the
 
06:46:19.190 --> 06:46:19.200 align:start position:0%
Fourth Amendment under the Fourth
 
06:46:21.548 --> 06:46:21.558 align:start position:0%
Amendment criminal investigations cannot
 
06:46:24.270 --> 06:46:24.280 align:start position:0%
directly result from an illegal search
 
06:46:26.150 --> 06:46:26.160 align:start position:0%
the exclusionary rule prevents the
 
06:46:27.830 --> 06:46:27.840 align:start position:0%
government from using most evidence
 
06:46:29.590 --> 06:46:29.600 align:start position:0%
gathered in violation of the United
 
06:46:32.070 --> 06:46:32.080 align:start position:0%
States Constitution for example the
 
06:46:34.070 --> 06:46:34.080 align:start position:0%
decision in Miranda versus a Arizona
 
06:46:36.388 --> 06:46:36.398 align:start position:0%
established that the exclusionary rule
 
06:46:38.708 --> 06:46:38.718 align:start position:0%
applies to improperly elicited self-
 
06:46:41.388 --> 06:46:41.398 align:start position:0%
incriminatory statements and to evidence
 
06:46:42.830 --> 06:46:42.840 align:start position:0%
gained in situations where the
 
06:46:45.070 --> 06:46:45.080 align:start position:0%
government violated the defendant 6th
 
06:46:47.708 --> 06:46:47.718 align:start position:0%
Amendment right to councel some of these
 
06:46:49.670 --> 06:46:49.680 align:start position:0%
individuals should be investigated or
 
06:46:53.190 --> 06:46:53.200 align:start position:0%
imprisoned but should not be um
 
06:46:55.388 --> 06:46:55.398 align:start position:0%
discouraged from Legally abandoning
 
06:46:58.190 --> 06:46:58.200 align:start position:0%
their babies remember this is about
 
06:47:00.510 --> 06:47:00.520 align:start position:0%
saving the babies not Prosecuting the
 
06:47:03.948 --> 06:47:03.958 align:start position:0%
parents find them some other way arrests
 
06:47:06.150 --> 06:47:06.160 align:start position:0%
due to the safe haven drop off has led
 
06:47:08.310 --> 06:47:08.320 align:start position:0%
to a decrease in abandonments and an
 
06:47:13.670 --> 06:47:13.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:47:16.110 --> 06:47:16.120 align:start position:0%
death the questions on the motion of
 
06:47:22.708 --> 06:47:22.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:47:24.948 --> 06:47:24.958 align:start position:0%
as what reason does a member ask
 
06:47:27.708 --> 06:47:27.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:47:30.548 --> 06:47:30.558 align:start position:0%
speaker is section five now that we've
 
06:47:32.510 --> 06:47:32.520 align:start position:0%
adopted this amendment something that
 
06:47:35.070 --> 06:47:35.080 align:start position:0%
can be separated Ed it out so that we
 
06:47:57.070 --> 06:47:57.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:47:59.388 --> 06:47:59.398 align:start position:0%
6 yes this
 
06:48:02.310 --> 06:48:02.320 align:start position:0%
divisible then Mr Speaker I would
 
06:48:06.030 --> 06:48:06.040 align:start position:0%
move to divide the the amendment that we
 
06:48:08.910 --> 06:48:08.920 align:start position:0%
adopted removing section five and pass
 
06:48:20.628 --> 06:48:20.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:48:22.868 --> 06:48:22.878 align:start position:0%
six okay so the question is shall
 
06:48:30.990 --> 06:48:31.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:48:34.230 --> 06:48:34.240 align:start position:0%
divided the question is shall section
 
06:48:38.788 --> 06:48:38.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:48:59.750 --> 06:48:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:49:02.150 --> 06:49:02.160 align:start position:0%
question rubs and have holes recognized
 
06:49:04.708 --> 06:49:04.718 align:start position:0%
to what
 
06:49:07.590 --> 06:49:07.600 align:start position:0%
okay the clerk has recognized to explain
 
06:49:07.600 --> 06:49:08.350 align:start position:0%
okay the clerk has recognized to explain
the

06:49:08.350 --> 06:49:08.360 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:49:13.150 --> 06:49:13.160 align:start position:0%
motion Mr Speaker the question is shall
 
06:49:16.070 --> 06:49:16.080 align:start position:0%
the vi the bill be divided what that
 
06:49:18.548 --> 06:49:18.558 align:start position:0%
would mean is SE section five that
 
06:49:20.270 --> 06:49:20.280 align:start position:0%
representative whole is asking to be
 
06:49:22.990 --> 06:49:23.000 align:start position:0%
divided means that we would vote on them
 
06:49:25.548 --> 06:49:25.558 align:start position:0%
separately if you vote Yes to divide it
 
06:49:28.110 --> 06:49:28.120 align:start position:0%
so sections 1 through 4 and section six
 
06:49:30.750 --> 06:49:30.760 align:start position:0%
would be a standalone motion and then
 
06:49:33.948 --> 06:49:33.958 align:start position:0%
subsequently a division uh
 
06:49:35.750 --> 06:49:35.760 align:start position:0%
if the division is successful then
 
06:49:37.510 --> 06:49:37.520 align:start position:0%
section five would be voted on
 
06:49:40.670 --> 06:49:40.680 align:start position:0%
separately so they would be you can you
 
06:49:44.150 --> 06:49:44.160 align:start position:0%
can adopt one without adopting the other
 
06:49:47.468 --> 06:49:47.478 align:start position:0%
to be clear you cannot table one or the
 
06:49:51.750 --> 06:49:51.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:49:55.150 --> 06:49:55.160 align:start position:0%
bill so the first question is whether or
 
06:49:58.150 --> 06:49:58.160 align:start position:0%
not you want to divide are you ready for
 
06:50:02.548 --> 06:50:02.558 align:start position:0%
the question all those in favor say I I
 
06:50:05.270 --> 06:50:05.280 align:start position:0%

nay keep the doors closed let's do a
 
06:50:07.920 --> 06:50:14.150 align:start position:0%
nay keep the doors closed let's do a
division

06:50:16.388 --> 06:50:16.398 align:start position:0%
vote yeah don't let any other other
 
06:50:24.230 --> 06:50:24.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:50:26.310 --> 06:50:26.320 align:start position:0%
clarification the question is whether to
 
06:50:28.628 --> 06:50:28.638 align:start position:0%

Oella thank you Mr Speaker I raise today
 
06:59:29.948 --> 06:59:29.958 align:start position:0%
in staunch opposition to the proposed
 
06:59:33.230 --> 06:59:33.240 align:start position:0%
amendment which my humble opinion
 
06:59:35.150 --> 06:59:35.160 align:start position:0%
uh possesses a grave threat to the
 
06:59:37.030 --> 06:59:37.040 align:start position:0%
financial responsibility we are
 
06:59:39.708 --> 06:59:39.718 align:start position:0%
entrusted to uphold this amendment and
 
06:59:41.948 --> 06:59:41.958 align:start position:0%
its ambiguous language grants waste
 
06:59:43.708 --> 06:59:43.718 align:start position:0%
districts to exceed their budgets
 
06:59:45.628 --> 06:59:45.638 align:start position:0%
without adequate checks and balances by
 
06:59:47.750 --> 06:59:47.760 align:start position:0%
permitting overspending in circumstances
 
06:59:53.110 --> 06:59:53.120 align:start position:0%
as vague as unusual circumstances arise
 
06:59:56.110 --> 06:59:56.120 align:start position:0%
furthermore it's essential to highlight
 
06:59:58.548 --> 06:59:58.558 align:start position:0%
that the proposed amendment actually
 
07:00:00.948 --> 07:00:00.958 align:start position:0%
references the existing
 
07:00:03.830 --> 07:00:03.840 align:start position:0%
solution uh to to unforeseen expenses
 
07:00:04.990 --> 07:00:05.000 align:start position:0%
which are not
 
07:00:07.430 --> 07:00:07.440 align:start position:0%
emergencies and that uh provided under
 
07:00:10.868 --> 07:00:10.878 align:start position:0%
current law which is a contingency fund
 
07:00:12.910 --> 07:00:12.920 align:start position:0%
waste districts already have access to
 
07:00:16.750 --> 07:00:16.760 align:start position:0%
these funds uh of of the creation of a
 
07:00:19.708 --> 07:00:19.718 align:start position:0%
fund um to address these unexpected
 
07:00:22.788 --> 07:00:22.798 align:start position:0%
costs that fall outside of the scope of
 
07:00:25.590 --> 07:00:25.600 align:start position:0%
their budget allocations instead of
 
07:00:28.030 --> 07:00:28.040 align:start position:0%
creating this vague language waste
 
07:00:30.070 --> 07:00:30.080 align:start position:0%
District should be encouraged to utilize
 
07:00:32.590 --> 07:00:32.600 align:start position:0%
the contingency fund when faced with
 
07:00:35.468 --> 07:00:35.478 align:start position:0%
usual circumstances that are not true
 
07:00:37.590 --> 07:00:37.600 align:start position:0%
emergencies as representatives of the
 
07:00:39.708 --> 07:00:39.718 align:start position:0%

transparency and accountability and
 
07:00:43.150 --> 07:00:43.160 align:start position:0%
government spending allow waste
 
07:00:46.030 --> 07:00:46.040 align:start position:0%
districts to bypass the municipality's
 
07:00:48.830 --> 07:00:48.840 align:start position:0%
refusal to pay increased costs and seek
 
07:00:50.830 --> 07:00:50.840 align:start position:0%
a recourse through the Department of
 
07:00:53.868 --> 07:00:53.878 align:start position:0%
Revenue under the guise of unusual
 
07:00:55.708 --> 07:00:55.718 align:start position:0%
circumstances undermines the very
 
07:00:57.708 --> 07:00:57.718 align:start position:0%
principles of the fiscal Prudence that
 
07:01:00.788 --> 07:01:00.798 align:start position:0%

this amendment and instead pursue

solutions that prior prioritize
 
07:01:13.788 --> 07:01:13.798 align:start position:0%
financial responsibility while
 
07:01:15.670 --> 07:01:15.680 align:start position:0%

07:02:16.350 --> 07:02:16.360 align:start position:0%
they cannot just stop operating when
 
07:02:17.910 --> 07:02:17.920 align:start position:0%
things happen where they might have to
 
07:02:20.750 --> 07:02:20.760 align:start position:0%
blow their budget during covid this came
 
07:02:22.150 --> 07:02:22.160 align:start position:0%
really close for a couple of them I know
 
07:02:24.430 --> 07:02:24.440 align:start position:0%
it did and if it hadn't been for arpa
 
07:02:26.070 --> 07:02:26.080 align:start position:0%
funds and for towns that could help make
 
07:02:27.990 --> 07:02:28.000 align:start position:0%
up the deficit some of these places
 
07:02:29.190 --> 07:02:29.200 align:start position:0%
would have had to stop collecting trash
 
07:02:30.788 --> 07:02:30.798 align:start position:0%
they would have had to stop accepting
 
07:02:33.788 --> 07:02:33.798 align:start position:0%
material into landfills
 
07:02:35.708 --> 07:02:35.718 align:start position:0%
the language in this bill comes directly
 
07:02:37.830 --> 07:02:37.840 align:start position:0%
from the language that already exists
 
07:02:39.910 --> 07:02:39.920 align:start position:0%
for school districts and municipalities
 
07:02:42.670 --> 07:02:42.680 align:start position:0%
it is a last
 
07:02:45.708 --> 07:02:45.718 align:start position:0%
resort if you can't if you if things
 
07:02:48.708 --> 07:02:48.718 align:start position:0%
happen and you can't keep functioning if
 
07:02:50.788 --> 07:02:50.798 align:start position:0%
the world conspires against you there
 
07:02:53.788 --> 07:02:53.798 align:start position:0%
are catastrophes that you can't control
 
07:02:55.708 --> 07:02:55.718 align:start position:0%
you can't just stop operating you can't
 
07:02:57.468 --> 07:02:57.478 align:start position:0%
stop you can't freeze your budget and
 
07:02:58.990 --> 07:02:59.000 align:start position:0%
shut down the landfill you can't freeze
 
07:03:00.788 --> 07:03:00.798 align:start position:0%
your budget and stop taking trash at the
 
07:03:03.750 --> 07:03:03.760 align:start position:0%
transfer station these are problems all
 
07:03:05.270 --> 07:03:05.280 align:start position:0%
this bill does is borrows language
 
07:03:06.990 --> 07:03:07.000 align:start position:0%
that's already existing in two places in
 
07:03:09.628 --> 07:03:09.638 align:start position:0%
the in the in the
 
07:03:12.910 --> 07:03:12.920 align:start position:0%
law it's important it is critical to
 
07:03:14.590 --> 07:03:14.600 align:start position:0%
continue these operations and it's it's
 
07:03:17.190 --> 07:03:17.200 align:start position:0%
something that hasn't happened it's just
 
07:03:19.670 --> 07:03:19.680 align:start position:0%
a last resort it's a fail safe it's
 
07:03:21.990 --> 07:03:22.000 align:start position:0%
something that during
 
07:03:24.430 --> 07:03:24.440 align:start position:0%
covid Solid Waste District said what
 
07:03:27.430 --> 07:03:27.440 align:start position:0%
would happen if that's all this is is a
 
07:03:28.990 --> 07:03:29.000 align:start position:0%
what would happen if there would be no
 
07:03:30.468 --> 07:03:30.478 align:start position:0%
Last Resort like Community like
 
07:03:32.868 --> 07:03:32.878 align:start position:0%
municipalities and and school districts
 
07:03:36.230 --> 07:03:36.240 align:start position:0%
have in order to access this These
 
07:03:38.190 --> 07:03:38.200 align:start position:0%
funds they would have to have already
 
07:03:40.150 --> 07:03:40.160 align:start position:0%
have a reserve fund and most of them do
 
07:03:41.628 --> 07:03:41.638 align:start position:0%
because they manage landfills they have
 
07:03:43.670 --> 07:03:43.680 align:start position:0%
to handle the engineering and the
 
07:03:46.230 --> 07:03:46.240 align:start position:0%
compliance they have to have something
 
07:03:49.150 --> 07:03:49.160 align:start position:0%
set aside for that so they already have
 
07:03:50.628 --> 07:03:50.638 align:start position:0%
access to this money they don't have
 
07:03:52.350 --> 07:03:52.360 align:start position:0%
access to to your tax dollars they don't
 
07:03:54.868 --> 07:03:54.878 align:start position:0%
have access to the town contingency
 
07:03:56.270 --> 07:03:56.280 align:start position:0%
funds they're not part of the Town
 
07:03:58.510 --> 07:03:58.520 align:start position:0%
they're a separate political entity they
 
07:04:01.310 --> 07:04:01.320 align:start position:0%
own land they can incur debt they can do
 
07:04:02.948 --> 07:04:02.958 align:start position:0%
everything the municipality can do
 
07:04:03.868 --> 07:04:03.878 align:start position:0%
without the
 
07:04:05.468 --> 07:04:05.478 align:start position:0%
municipality they are their own
 
07:04:05.478 --> 07:04:06.388 align:start position:0%
municipality they are their own
political

07:04:06.388 --> 07:04:06.398 align:start position:0%
political
 
07:04:10.868 --> 07:04:10.878 align:start position:0%
entity so this stuff this this is really
 
07:04:13.230 --> 07:04:13.240 align:start position:0%
critical if Co happens again and the
 
07:04:15.430 --> 07:04:15.440 align:start position:0%
towns can't help make up the
 
07:04:17.230 --> 07:04:17.240 align:start position:0%
deficit what are we supposed to do with
 
07:04:18.628 --> 07:04:18.638 align:start position:0%
a trash where does it
 
07:04:20.868 --> 07:04:20.878 align:start position:0%
go this is a fail safe this isn't
 
07:04:22.468 --> 07:04:22.478 align:start position:0%
something that happens every day this is
 
07:04:23.830 --> 07:04:23.840 align:start position:0%
isn't permission for them to blow their
 
07:04:26.190 --> 07:04:26.200 align:start position:0%
budgets this is
 
07:04:29.190 --> 07:04:29.200 align:start position:0%
just you know the world is falling apart
 
07:04:31.388 --> 07:04:31.398 align:start position:0%
there are you know geopolitical problems
 
07:04:33.110 --> 07:04:33.120 align:start position:0%
China shut down recycling a few years
 
07:04:34.310 --> 07:04:34.320 align:start position:0%
ago that caused a lot of problems
 
07:04:36.510 --> 07:04:36.520 align:start position:0%
because we rely on Revenue to take care
 
07:04:39.030 --> 07:04:39.040 align:start position:0%
of these from those Commodities so that
 
07:04:41.510 --> 07:04:41.520 align:start position:0%
put us in a in a tight spot so this is
 
07:04:43.868 --> 07:04:43.878 align:start position:0%
just a last resort there are a couple
 
07:04:45.350 --> 07:04:45.360 align:start position:0%
other pieces of this that are just
 
07:04:46.548 --> 07:04:46.558 align:start position:0%
common sense
 
07:04:49.468 --> 07:04:49.478 align:start position:0%
management um I hope you can support
 
07:04:52.030 --> 07:04:52.040 align:start position:0%
this bill it is important Solid Waste
 
07:04:53.310 --> 07:04:53.320 align:start position:0%
districts are important they do a lot
 
07:04:54.750 --> 07:04:54.760 align:start position:0%
for our communities they help us save us
 
07:04:56.468 --> 07:04:56.478 align:start position:0%
a lot of money on on disposal and help
 
07:04:58.510 --> 07:04:58.520 align:start position:0%

07:11:52.310 --> 07:11:52.320 align:start position:0%
this amendment uh removes the vague
 
07:11:55.350 --> 07:11:55.360 align:start position:0%
language and removes uh those
 
07:11:57.510 --> 07:11:57.520 align:start position:0%
contingencies that the previous speaker
 
07:11:59.350 --> 07:11:59.360 align:start position:0%
said oh we don't really need it unless
 
07:12:01.830 --> 07:12:01.840 align:start position:0%
there's a a pandemic or something like
 
07:12:04.548 --> 07:12:04.558 align:start position:0%
like that this actually addresses the
 
07:12:07.350 --> 07:12:07.360 align:start position:0%
real issue which is that if there was a
 
07:12:09.070 --> 07:12:09.080 align:start position:0%
big producer of waste inside of the
 
07:12:11.468 --> 07:12:11.478 align:start position:0%
waste district and they need to direct
 
07:12:15.230 --> 07:12:15.240 align:start position:0%
instead of just accept that uh waste
 
07:12:17.430 --> 07:12:17.440 align:start position:0%
that they are allowed to do so so I hope
 
07:12:19.788 --> 07:12:19.798 align:start position:0%
you would uh uh vote in favor of this
 
07:12:27.990 --> 07:12:28.000 align:start position:0%

07:21:06.150 --> 07:21:06.160 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker first let me tell
 
07:21:08.230 --> 07:21:08.240 align:start position:0%
you about this amendment about what it's
 
07:21:10.468 --> 07:21:10.478 align:start position:0%
not because there's some confusion out
 
07:21:12.910 --> 07:21:12.920 align:start position:0%
there about what this does so first of
 
07:21:15.548 --> 07:21:15.558 align:start position:0%
all this amendment is not about gambling
 
07:21:16.948 --> 07:21:16.958 align:start position:0%
it's not a gambling it doesn't have to
 
07:21:18.468 --> 07:21:18.478 align:start position:0%
do with gambling
 
07:21:21.468 --> 07:21:21.478 align:start position:0%
licenses it's not an unprecedented
 
07:21:23.030 --> 07:21:23.040 align:start position:0%
action what we're going to be debating
 
07:21:24.670 --> 07:21:24.680 align:start position:0%
right now it's something that has been
 
07:21:27.310 --> 07:21:27.320 align:start position:0%
done and is is in law
 
07:21:30.590 --> 07:21:30.600 align:start position:0%
now it's not a revenue generating bill
 
07:21:33.110 --> 07:21:33.120 align:start position:0%
and it's not an expenditure bill this is
 
07:21:35.910 --> 07:21:35.920 align:start position:0%
has nothing to do with with funds this
 
07:21:38.868 --> 07:21:38.878 align:start position:0%
bill will not hurt New Hampshire
 
07:21:42.030 --> 07:21:42.040 align:start position:0%
Charities and the timing of this bill is
 
07:21:42.040 --> 07:21:43.388 align:start position:0%
Charities and the timing of this bill is
not

07:21:43.388 --> 07:21:43.398 align:start position:0%
not
 
07:21:46.830 --> 07:21:46.840 align:start position:0%
bad so the Genesis of this and I
 
07:21:48.510 --> 07:21:48.520 align:start position:0%
understand it was a non-gain amendment
 
07:21:52.190 --> 07:21:52.200 align:start position:0%
that came uh came through um Municipal
 
07:21:54.030 --> 07:21:54.040 align:start position:0%
and County committee but the Genesis
 
07:21:56.628 --> 07:21:56.638 align:start position:0%
stems from a request made by some of my
 
07:21:59.310 --> 07:21:59.320 align:start position:0%
constituents to our town officials for a
 
07:22:01.788 --> 07:22:01.798 align:start position:0%
local option vote
 
07:22:04.590 --> 07:22:04.600 align:start position:0%
on casino gambling you see seven years
 
07:22:06.628 --> 07:22:06.638 align:start position:0%
several years ago our town voted to
 
07:22:10.548 --> 07:22:10.558 align:start position:0%
permit Kino operators and my
 
07:22:12.788 --> 07:22:12.798 align:start position:0%
constituents assumed the same local
 
07:22:16.708 --> 07:22:16.718 align:start position:0%
option applied to other games of chance
 
07:22:20.190 --> 07:22:20.200 align:start position:0%
so this winter they approached the the
 
07:22:22.708 --> 07:22:22.718 align:start position:0%
the planning board and the zoning board
 
07:22:25.388 --> 07:22:25.398 align:start position:0%
and much to everyone's surprise when
 
07:22:28.070 --> 07:22:28.080 align:start position:0%
they checked the law the the local
 
07:22:32.310 --> 07:22:32.320 align:start position:0%
option did not was not did didn't stand
 
07:22:34.468 --> 07:22:34.478 align:start position:0%
for casino gambling so they had it for
 
07:22:36.070 --> 07:22:36.080 align:start position:0%
we have it for Kino
 
07:22:38.230 --> 07:22:38.240 align:start position:0%
gambling but they don't have it for
 
07:22:41.750 --> 07:22:41.760 align:start position:0%
casino gambling so much like a zoning
 
07:22:44.190 --> 07:22:44.200 align:start position:0%
ordinance a local option empowers a
 
07:22:47.190 --> 07:22:47.200 align:start position:0%
community to determine what is best for
 
07:22:50.468 --> 07:22:50.478 align:start position:0%
them for their Community recognizing
 
07:22:52.868 --> 07:22:52.878 align:start position:0%
that these facilities entail
 
07:22:55.070 --> 07:22:55.080 align:start position:0%
considerable investment millions of
 
07:22:57.150 --> 07:22:57.160 align:start position:0%
dollars to build these the amendment
 
07:22:59.948 --> 07:22:59.958 align:start position:0%
we're talking about includes safeguards
 
07:23:03.788 --> 07:23:03.798 align:start position:0%
to ensure that current operators and
 
07:23:06.868 --> 07:23:06.878 align:start position:0%
approved future operators are not
 
07:23:09.430 --> 07:23:09.440 align:start position:0%
blindsided by any changes and the state
 
07:23:11.190 --> 07:23:11.200 align:start position:0%
will not pull the rug out from somebody
 
07:23:12.628 --> 07:23:12.638 align:start position:0%
who's made a considerable investment
 
07:23:13.910 --> 07:23:13.920 align:start position:0%
into these
 
07:23:17.150 --> 07:23:17.160 align:start position:0%
communities the timing of this bill this
 
07:23:19.708 --> 07:23:19.718 align:start position:0%
enabling bill is crucial because there's
 
07:23:22.708 --> 07:23:22.718 align:start position:0%
a specific gaming moratorium in New
 
07:23:25.628 --> 07:23:25.638 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that's set to expire and the
 
07:23:27.830 --> 07:23:27.840 align:start position:0%
status of some of the other moratorium
 
07:23:30.190 --> 07:23:30.200 align:start position:0%
bills that are being debated right now
 
07:23:31.990 --> 07:23:32.000 align:start position:0%
is uncertain
 
07:23:34.510 --> 07:23:34.520 align:start position:0%
so ensuring the effectiveness of this
 
07:23:37.308 --> 07:23:37.318 align:start position:0%
bill by July 1st 2024 when the current
 
07:23:37.318 --> 07:23:38.628 align:start position:0%
bill by July 1st 2024 when the current
moratorium

07:23:38.628 --> 07:23:38.638 align:start position:0%
moratorium
 
07:23:41.628 --> 07:23:41.638 align:start position:0%
expires is essential for our responsible
 
07:23:43.350 --> 07:23:43.360 align:start position:0%
consideration of our New Hampshire
 
07:23:44.830 --> 07:23:44.840 align:start position:0%
cities and
 
07:23:48.070 --> 07:23:48.080 align:start position:0%
towns so moreover this I want to point
 
07:23:50.990 --> 07:23:51.000 align:start position:0%
out is a bipartisan Bill the the vote is
 
07:23:54.548 --> 07:23:54.558 align:start position:0%
bipartisan it came out with a 15-5
 
07:23:56.868 --> 07:23:56.878 align:start position:0%
majority one of the most important parts
 
07:24:00.750 --> 07:24:00.760 align:start position:0%
of this is this amendment has received
 
07:24:02.590 --> 07:24:02.600 align:start position:0%
the the approval of the New Hampshire
 
07:24:04.830 --> 07:24:04.840 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming operators so all the
 
07:24:09.510 --> 07:24:09.520 align:start position:0%
ATT parties involved in this are in
 
07:24:09.520 --> 07:24:12.150 align:start position:0%
ATT parties involved in this are in
agreement

07:24:12.150 --> 07:24:12.160 align:start position:0%
agreement
 
07:24:14.788 --> 07:24:14.798 align:start position:0%
um they in and the charitable gaming
 
07:24:16.548 --> 07:24:16.558 align:start position:0%
operators Association are committed to
 
07:24:18.070 --> 07:24:18.080 align:start position:0%
being good neighbors and want the
 
07:24:19.628 --> 07:24:19.638 align:start position:0%
communities where they operate to feel
 
07:24:21.270 --> 07:24:21.280 align:start position:0%
comfortable with their facilities and
 
07:24:24.750 --> 07:24:24.760 align:start position:0%
their businesses so in essence HB 1223
 
07:24:25.910 --> 07:24:25.920 align:start position:0%
and the amendment that we're talking
 
07:24:28.350 --> 07:24:28.360 align:start position:0%
about today is about empowering local
 
07:24:31.070 --> 07:24:31.080 align:start position:0%
communities to make decisions that align
 
07:24:33.830 --> 07:24:33.840 align:start position:0%
with their values and needs while also
 
07:24:36.150 --> 07:24:36.160 align:start position:0%
providing stability and support for
 
07:24:38.868 --> 07:24:38.878 align:start position:0%
gaming operators it's a balanced
 
07:24:41.270 --> 07:24:41.280 align:start position:0%
approach that merits our
 
07:24:43.708 --> 07:24:43.718 align:start position:0%
support and you can bet I'm going to hit
 
07:24:48.830 --> 07:24:48.840 align:start position:0%
 
07:24:52.548 --> 07:24:52.558 align:start position:0%
button for those that of you left in the
 
07:24:55.510 --> 07:24:55.520 align:start position:0%
chamber snacks have been delivered out
 
07:24:56.990 --> 07:24:57.000 align:start position:0%
in the anti
 
07:24:59.590 --> 07:24:59.600 align:start position:0%
room and they will be replenished when
 
07:25:02.990 --> 07:25:03.000 align:start position:0%
they run out and just a reminder there
 
07:25:05.830 --> 07:25:05.840 align:start position:0%
was no food or drink in the chamber
 
07:25:11.788 --> 07:25:11.798 align:start position:0%
 
07:25:14.070 --> 07:25:14.080 align:start position:0%
yella thank you Mr
 
07:25:16.670 --> 07:25:16.680 align:start position:0%
Speaker I just want to address one of
 
07:25:20.230 --> 07:25:20.240 align:start position:0%
the things that was just said and that
 
07:25:22.750 --> 07:25:22.760 align:start position:0%
is that this is a local option it
 
07:25:24.948 --> 07:25:24.958 align:start position:0%
doesn't change anything it's just
 
07:25:27.308 --> 07:25:27.318 align:start position:0%
allowing municipalities to choose that's
 
07:25:30.948 --> 07:25:30.958 align:start position:0%
wrong it's just wrong that right now if
 
07:25:35.270 --> 07:25:35.280 align:start position:0%
a if a municipality allows gaming in
 
07:25:35.280 --> 07:25:36.070 align:start position:0%
a if a municipality allows gaming in
their

07:25:36.070 --> 07:25:36.080 align:start position:0%
their
 
07:25:38.350 --> 07:25:38.360 align:start position:0%
zoning cuz that's how it's currently
 
07:25:40.350 --> 07:25:40.360 align:start position:0%
regulated by the by the towns if they
 
07:25:41.750 --> 07:25:41.760 align:start position:0%
currently allow
 
07:25:45.830 --> 07:25:45.840 align:start position:0%
it the passage of this negates that it's
 
07:25:49.030 --> 07:25:49.040 align:start position:0%
automatically disallowed in the entire
 
07:25:51.868 --> 07:25:51.878 align:start position:0%
State congratulations it's not a local
 
07:25:54.670 --> 07:25:54.680 align:start position:0%
option you're saying not only is it
 
07:25:57.230 --> 07:25:57.240 align:start position:0%
banned in the entire state if you want
 
07:25:59.910 --> 07:25:59.920 align:start position:0%
the gaming establishment you have to
 
07:26:02.628 --> 07:26:02.638 align:start position:0%
pass a specific Warren article saying
 
07:26:04.750 --> 07:26:04.760 align:start position:0%
that it is allowed that is that is
 
07:26:07.110 --> 07:26:07.120 align:start position:0%
dictated inside of the
 
07:26:10.868 --> 07:26:10.878 align:start position:0%
statute so no no town has currently done
 
07:26:13.510 --> 07:26:13.520 align:start position:0%
that because they're allowed to regulate
 
07:26:16.948 --> 07:26:16.958 align:start position:0%
it through zoning now what we have is a
 
07:26:19.430 --> 07:26:19.440 align:start position:0%
situation where someone didn't regulate
 
07:26:21.270 --> 07:26:21.280 align:start position:0%
it out of out of their Town through
 
07:26:23.430 --> 07:26:23.440 align:start position:0%
zoning and are complaining that they
 
07:26:27.868 --> 07:26:27.878 align:start position:0%
didn't regulate It Out by zoning and now
 
07:26:31.308 --> 07:26:31.318 align:start position:0%
they want a Statewide ban and you
 
07:26:33.230 --> 07:26:33.240 align:start position:0%
your municipalities will have to come
 
07:26:35.548 --> 07:26:35.558 align:start position:0%
back and say okay now we're going to
 
07:26:38.350 --> 07:26:38.360 align:start position:0%
allow it and it's going into effect
 
07:26:41.030 --> 07:26:41.040 align:start position:0%
right away it's not giving you time to
 
07:26:43.468 --> 07:26:43.478 align:start position:0%
you know say like hey I want to make
 
07:26:43.478 --> 07:26:44.628 align:start position:0%
you know say like hey I want to make
this

07:26:44.628 --> 07:26:44.638 align:start position:0%
this
 
07:26:48.270 --> 07:26:48.280 align:start position:0%
uh uh warrant article on my next ballot
 
07:26:50.788 --> 07:26:50.798 align:start position:0%
no it's it's banned right away before
 
07:26:53.190 --> 07:26:53.200 align:start position:0%
the voters H and your local municipality
 
07:26:55.430 --> 07:26:55.440 align:start position:0%
have had the Cho choice or opportunity
 
07:26:59.030 --> 07:26:59.040 align:start position:0%
to ever vote on it for that reason alone
 
07:27:01.230 --> 07:27:01.240 align:start position:0%
it's not a local option
 
07:27:03.468 --> 07:27:03.478 align:start position:0%
it's a mandate and you should vote
 
07:27:05.990 --> 07:27:06.000 align:start position:0%
against it thank you Mr
 
07:27:14.548 --> 07:27:14.558 align:start position:0%
 
07:27:18.468 --> 07:27:18.478 align:start position:0%
 
07:27:21.868 --> 07:27:21.878 align:start position:0%
Speaker so my constituents like my
 
07:27:23.788 --> 07:27:23.798 align:start position:0%
colleague from littleton's have
 
07:27:25.430 --> 07:27:25.440 align:start position:0%
considered the question of whether to
 
07:27:29.868 --> 07:27:29.878 align:start position:0%
allow Kino in the town of Conway in fact
 
07:27:33.510 --> 07:27:33.520 align:start position:0%
we've done it five times and each time
 
07:27:35.270 --> 07:27:35.280 align:start position:0%
the question has come before the voters
 
07:27:38.510 --> 07:27:38.520 align:start position:0%
in my town they've rejected it
 
07:27:41.948 --> 07:27:41.958 align:start position:0%
soundly most recently just last year
 
07:27:43.308 --> 07:27:43.318 align:start position:0%
more than
 
07:27:46.270 --> 07:27:46.280 align:start position:0%
75% of my constituents voted down yet
 
07:27:49.230 --> 07:27:49.240 align:start position:0%
another Warren article to allow Kino
 
07:27:52.270 --> 07:27:52.280 align:start position:0%
it's a striking and consistent message
 
07:27:54.468 --> 07:27:54.478 align:start position:0%
from the town's
 
07:27:58.270 --> 07:27:58.280 align:start position:0%
people and yet
 
07:28:01.070 --> 07:28:01.080 align:start position:0%
paradoxically my constituents finds eles
 
07:28:03.830 --> 07:28:03.840 align:start position:0%
facing a situation where the decision as
 
07:28:05.948 --> 07:28:05.958 align:start position:0%
to whether or not our town should host a
 
07:28:08.948 --> 07:28:08.958 align:start position:0%
casino is out of our
 
07:28:11.110 --> 07:28:11.120 align:start position:0%
hands it's
 
07:28:13.510 --> 07:28:13.520 align:start position:0%
absurd the idea that while we can
 
07:28:17.910 --> 07:28:17.920 align:start position:0%
repeatedly exercise our statutory right
 
07:28:22.468 --> 07:28:22.478 align:start position:0%
to refuse Kino we have no say in whether
 
07:28:25.070 --> 07:28:25.080 align:start position:0%
a casino sets up shop in our
 
07:28:28.548 --> 07:28:28.558 align:start position:0%
backyard and this in congruity is what
 
07:28:32.910 --> 07:28:32.920 align:start position:0%
 
07:28:34.948 --> 07:28:34.958 align:start position:0%
and contrary to what the last speaker
 
07:28:39.270 --> 07:28:39.280 align:start position:0%
said we can't wind back the clock in
 
07:28:41.750 --> 07:28:41.760 align:start position:0%
towns like mine where the ship has
 
07:28:41.760 --> 07:28:42.990 align:start position:0%
towns like mine where the ship has
already

07:28:42.990 --> 07:28:43.000 align:start position:0%
already
 
07:28:45.750 --> 07:28:45.760 align:start position:0%
sailed we are going to have a
 
07:28:49.590 --> 07:28:49.600 align:start position:0%
casino but this bill will ensure that
 
07:28:49.600 --> 07:28:50.430 align:start position:0%
casino but this bill will ensure that
other

07:28:50.430 --> 07:28:50.440 align:start position:0%
other
 
07:28:52.990 --> 07:28:53.000 align:start position:0%
towns maybe your
 
07:28:57.110 --> 07:28:57.120 align:start position:0%
town are given the courtesy of a choice
 
07:28:59.948 --> 07:28:59.958 align:start position:0%
that my constituents never received no
 
07:29:01.590 --> 07:29:01.600 align:start position:0%
that's just
 
07:29:03.910 --> 07:29:03.920 align:start position:0%
this is not an anti-gambling
 
07:29:07.230 --> 07:29:07.240 align:start position:0%
bill it's about fundamental principles
 
07:29:09.990 --> 07:29:10.000 align:start position:0%
of local governance it's about giving
 
07:29:14.308 --> 07:29:14.318 align:start position:0%
communities like mine like yours that
 
07:29:17.868 --> 07:29:17.878 align:start position:0%
courtesy of a choice this bill just
 
07:29:21.350 --> 07:29:21.360 align:start position:0%
extends to casinos the same local option
 
07:29:23.070 --> 07:29:23.080 align:start position:0%
we have for Kino through the waren
 
07:29:23.080 --> 07:29:25.070 align:start position:0%
we have for Kino through the waren

process in small towns across New
 
07:29:29.430 --> 07:29:29.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire in places like Conway and
 
07:29:31.990 --> 07:29:32.000 align:start position:0%
Littleton we seen firsthand the
 
07:29:34.948 --> 07:29:34.958 align:start position:0%
frustration of our constituents when
 
07:29:36.788 --> 07:29:36.798 align:start position:0%
they realize with shock what little
 
07:29:39.070 --> 07:29:39.080 align:start position:0%
control they have over such a
 
07:29:39.080 --> 07:29:40.388 align:start position:0%
control they have over such a
significant

07:29:40.388 --> 07:29:40.398 align:start position:0%
significant
 
07:29:43.788 --> 07:29:43.798 align:start position:0%
decision a decision sometimes affecting
 
07:29:47.308 --> 07:29:47.318 align:start position:0%
the very character of the heart of their
 
07:29:50.948 --> 07:29:50.958 align:start position:0%
downtown this bill offers a solution and
 
07:29:52.708 --> 07:29:52.718 align:start position:0%
I'm pleased that the gaming industry
 
07:29:54.868 --> 07:29:54.878 align:start position:0%
came to the table in this process and
 
07:29:57.230 --> 07:29:57.240 align:start position:0%
worked with the sponsors and committee
 
07:29:59.548 --> 07:29:59.558 align:start position:0%
ensuring an approach that is fair and
 
07:30:01.030 --> 07:30:01.040 align:start position:0%
reasonable for oper
 
07:30:04.510 --> 07:30:04.520 align:start position:0%
operators this bill doesn't jeopardize
 
07:30:07.990 --> 07:30:08.000 align:start position:0%
operators existing Investments it simply
 
07:30:09.510 --> 07:30:09.520 align:start position:0%
ensures that in the

communities with the current moratorium

set to expire imminently we need to act
 
07:30:28.788 --> 07:30:28.798 align:start position:0%
decisively now to ensure that towns
 
07:30:31.788 --> 07:30:31.798 align:start position:0%
across New Hampshire are guaranteed this

the well of Representatives Hall making
 
07:37:39.030 --> 07:37:39.040 align:start position:0%
the case as to why the state should
 
07:37:41.308 --> 07:37:41.318 align:start position:0%
retain ownership of Continental
 
07:37:44.350 --> 07:37:44.360 align:start position:0%
Boulevard and today I return and those
 
07:37:46.430 --> 07:37:46.440 align:start position:0%
same facts remain as the Roads

07:37:55.230 --> 07:37:55.240 align:start position:0%
bigger the town of meramac has never
 
07:37:56.788 --> 07:37:56.798 align:start position:0%
owned this
 
07:37:59.190 --> 07:37:59.200 align:start position:0%
road the state of the the State's
 
07:38:00.510 --> 07:38:00.520 align:start position:0%
Department of transp
 
07:38:03.468 --> 07:38:03.478 align:start position:0%
ation built this 2.5 mile stretch of
 
07:38:04.628 --> 07:38:04.638 align:start position:0%
road in
 
07:38:07.510 --> 07:38:07.520 align:start position:0%
1993 through eminent do eminent domain
 
07:38:09.468 --> 07:38:09.478 align:start position:0%
proceedings over the ejections of the
 
07:38:12.350 --> 07:38:12.360 align:start position:0%
town the prevailing argument made by the
 
07:38:15.590 --> 07:38:15.600 align:start position:0%
do at that moment in time that public
 
07:38:17.548 --> 07:38:17.558 align:start position:0%
necessity for the use of private
 
07:38:20.548 --> 07:38:20.558 align:start position:0%
property for this road was needed by the
 
07:38:23.190 --> 07:38:23.200 align:start position:0%
public in the region for greater good
 
07:38:25.708 --> 07:38:25.718 align:start position:0%
some 30 years later Continental
 
07:38:28.548 --> 07:38:28.558 align:start position:0%
Boulevard serves as the primary arterial
 
07:38:32.270 --> 07:38:32.280 align:start position:0%
connection from route 101a to the F ever
 
07:38:36.270 --> 07:38:36.280 align:start position:0%
Turnpike the road handles over 177,000
 
07:38:39.308 --> 07:38:39.318 align:start position:0%
Vehicles daily as it feeds Westbound and
 
07:38:43.308 --> 07:38:43.318 align:start position:0%
eastbound traffic along 101a to exit 10
 
07:38:47.708 --> 07:38:47.718 align:start position:0%
and 11 on the Fe Everett in marac away
 
07:38:50.750 --> 07:38:50.760 align:start position:0%
from overburdening exit 7 in
 
07:38:54.270 --> 07:38:54.280 align:start position:0%
nashwa these traffic valume volumes also
 
07:38:56.708 --> 07:38:56.718 align:start position:0%
exceed the urban compact section of
 
07:38:59.190 --> 07:38:59.200 align:start position:0%
Daniel Webster Highway in meramac that
 
07:39:01.670 --> 07:39:01.680 align:start position:0%
road handles Les approximately 15,000
 
07:39:04.110 --> 07:39:04.120 align:start position:0%
Vehicles daily in my
 
07:39:06.628 --> 07:39:06.638 align:start position:0%
town now the dot contends that this
 
07:39:08.868 --> 07:39:08.878 align:start position:0%
stretch of roadway is no longer a public
 
07:39:11.548 --> 07:39:11.558 align:start position:0%
necessity to the state and it seeks to
 
07:39:13.110 --> 07:39:13.120 align:start position:0%
abdicate its ownership and
 
07:39:15.868 --> 07:39:15.878 align:start position:0%
responsibility from a roadway it richly
 
07:39:17.628 --> 07:39:17.638 align:start position:0%
wanted back in
 
07:39:20.070 --> 07:39:20.080 align:start position:0%
1993 the town's absorption of this
 
07:39:23.110 --> 07:39:23.120 align:start position:0%
roadway to our town budget will be an
 
07:39:26.190 --> 07:39:26.200 align:start position:0%
additional $500,000 annually with
 
07:39:28.990 --> 07:39:29.000 align:start position:0%
long-term capital costs exceeding $7
 
07:39:31.230 --> 07:39:31.240 align:start position:0%
million over the next 20
 
07:39:31.240 --> 07:39:32.750 align:start position:0%
million over the next 20
years

07:39:32.750 --> 07:39:32.760 align:start position:0%
years
 
07:39:35.388 --> 07:39:35.398 align:start position:0%
furthermore the town could be acquiring
 
07:39:37.910 --> 07:39:37.920 align:start position:0%
a roadway from the do that is currently
 
07:39:40.990 --> 07:39:41.000 align:start position:0%
scheduled by them for a facelift next
 
07:39:43.750 --> 07:39:43.760 align:start position:0%
year the town's projected cost for
 
07:39:46.030 --> 07:39:46.040 align:start position:0%
repaving this 2.5 Mile Stretch of
 
07:39:50.308 --> 07:39:50.318 align:start position:0%
roadway lands just shy of $2 million a
 
07:39:52.510 --> 07:39:52.520 align:start position:0%
single cost that exceeds the town's
 
07:39:54.750 --> 07:39:54.760 align:start position:0%
yearly Paving
 
07:39:57.150 --> 07:39:57.160 align:start position:0%
budget as you deliberate this floor
 
07:40:00.468 --> 07:40:00.478 align:start position:0%
Amendment please consider this fact
 
07:40:02.708 --> 07:40:02.718 align:start position:0%
the state's AB abdication of Continental
 
07:40:05.510 --> 07:40:05.520 align:start position:0%
Boulevard to the town of meramac will be
 
07:40:08.308 --> 07:40:08.318 align:start position:0%
a lynchpin in how the dot handles other
 
07:40:10.510 --> 07:40:10.520 align:start position:0%
state roadways in New Hampshire that
 
07:40:13.430 --> 07:40:13.440 align:start position:0%
they don't want to maintain and pay the
 
07:40:14.868 --> 07:40:14.878 align:start position:0%
mission creep of giving up State
 
07:40:16.990 --> 07:40:17.000 align:start position:0%
roadways for cost efficiencies would
 
07:40:20.190 --> 07:40:20.200 align:start position:0%

Mastro 114a in gtown to name a few the
 
07:40:35.990 --> 07:40:36.000 align:start position:0%
list will become endless if we remove
 
07:40:38.230 --> 07:40:38.240 align:start position:0%
the Lynch pin and vote to approve the
 
07:40:39.830 --> 07:40:39.840 align:start position:0%

it has been entrusted to oversee thank
 
07:40:57.510 --> 07:40:57.520 align:start position:0%
you Mr Speaker and I ask for a division
 
07:40:59.430 --> 07:40:59.440 align:start position:0%
vote does the member yield to questions
 
07:40:59.440 --> 07:41:00.388 align:start position:0%
vote does the member yield to questions
absolutely

07:41:00.388 --> 07:41:00.398 align:start position:0%
absolutely
 
07:41:07.628 --> 07:41:07.638 align:start position:0%
 
07:41:09.628 --> 07:41:09.638 align:start position:0%
inquire thank you Mr speaker thank you
 
07:41:10.750 --> 07:41:10.760 align:start position:0%
representative Boyd for taking my
 
07:41:13.510 --> 07:41:13.520 align:start position:0%
question so if I understand correctly if
 
07:41:15.548 --> 07:41:15.558 align:start position:0%
we support this floor Amendment we'll
 
07:41:18.948 --> 07:41:18.958 align:start position:0%
prevent the unfunded mandate to marac
 
07:41:21.388 --> 07:41:21.398 align:start position:0%
and we'll stop the dangerous precedent
 
07:41:25.910 --> 07:41:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
07:41:27.830 --> 07:41:27.840 align:start position:0%
town thank you for the question
 
07:41:29.868 --> 07:41:29.878 align:start position:0%
representative mchu and that's correct
 
07:41:32.910 --> 07:41:32.920 align:start position:0%
it would stop the unfunded mandate um
 
07:41:35.750 --> 07:41:35.760 align:start position:0%
that is uh elucidated in part one
 
07:41:38.388 --> 07:41:38.398 align:start position:0%
Article 28 of our constitution where the
 
07:41:41.150 --> 07:41:41.160 align:start position:0%
state shall not mandate or assign any
 
07:41:43.350 --> 07:41:43.360 align:start position:0%

07:41:51.910 --> 07:41:51.920 align:start position:0%
expenditures for what reason do the
 
07:41:51.920 --> 07:41:53.270 align:start position:0%
expenditures for what reason do the
member

07:41:53.270 --> 07:41:53.280 align:start position:0%

07:41:55.788 --> 07:41:55.798 align:start position:0%
rise I'd like to ask a question of the
 
07:41:57.590 --> 07:41:57.600 align:start position:0%
representative does the member yield to
 
07:41:59.708 --> 07:41:59.718 align:start position:0%
a further question I yield you may
 
07:42:01.708 --> 07:42:01.718 align:start position:0%
inquire thank you Mr Speaker
 
07:42:03.388 --> 07:42:03.398 align:start position:0%
representative thank you for taking my
 
07:42:06.150 --> 07:42:06.160 align:start position:0%
question this is regarding the do
 
07:42:09.510 --> 07:42:09.520 align:start position:0%
construction on Route 101a at penu
 
07:42:12.030 --> 07:42:12.040 align:start position:0%
Square would you believe that if the
 
07:42:14.548 --> 07:42:14.558 align:start position:0%
state didn't think that Continental
 
07:42:17.350 --> 07:42:17.360 align:start position:0%
Boulevard had a regional impact to
 
07:42:20.030 --> 07:42:20.040 align:start position:0%
traffic flows along Route
 
07:42:23.190 --> 07:42:23.200 align:start position:0%
101a then they wouldn't be proposing to
 
07:42:25.628 --> 07:42:25.638 align:start position:0%
widen that stretch of roadway there a
 
07:42:28.628 --> 07:42:28.638 align:start position:0%
project that is currently
 
07:42:31.190 --> 07:42:31.200 align:start position:0%
underway I thank the gentle lady for the
 
07:42:32.990 --> 07:42:33.000 align:start position:0%
question and yes I would believe because
 
07:42:34.750 --> 07:42:34.760 align:start position:0%
I know that the dot met with the town of
 
07:42:38.510 --> 07:42:38.520 align:start position:0%
marac last week to discuss the prospects
 
07:42:41.190 --> 07:42:41.200 align:start position:0%
of the construction in penak square a
 
07:42:43.190 --> 07:42:43.200 align:start position:0%
construction project that has been in

the 10-year plan previously to the T to5
 
07:42:49.430 --> 07:42:49.440 align:start position:0%
million and includes widening
 
07:42:52.230 --> 07:42:52.240 align:start position:0%
sewer amongst other amenities to improve
 
07:42:55.030 --> 07:42:55.040 align:start position:0%

07:43:04.350 --> 07:43:04.360 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker and thanks to my
 
07:43:06.430 --> 07:43:06.440 align:start position:0%
esteemed colleague from miramac for
 
07:43:09.110 --> 07:43:09.120 align:start position:0%
bringing forth this floor Amendment for
 
07:43:12.230 --> 07:43:12.240 align:start position:0%
years misinformation has infiltrated the
 
07:43:15.670 --> 07:43:15.680 align:start position:0%
debate about miramac tolls and now about
 
07:43:18.030 --> 07:43:18.040 align:start position:0%
Continental Boulevard which has led to
 
07:43:21.270 --> 07:43:21.280 align:start position:0%
some bad decisions handing over
 
07:43:23.670 --> 07:43:23.680 align:start position:0%
ownership of Continental Boulevard to
 
07:43:26.070 --> 07:43:26.080 align:start position:0%
marac from the state would be a bad
 
07:43:28.628 --> 07:43:28.638 align:start position:0%
decision so allow me to set the record
 
07:43:32.230 --> 07:43:32.240 align:start position:0%
straight decades ago against the wishes
 
07:43:34.670 --> 07:43:34.680 align:start position:0%
of the town of marac which you've heard
 
07:43:37.070 --> 07:43:37.080 align:start position:0%
the state built Continental Boulevard to
 
07:43:40.190 --> 07:43:40.200 align:start position:0%
connect to 101a and the Everett Turnpike
 
07:43:43.590 --> 07:43:43.600 align:start position:0%
both state roads it was so important to
 
07:43:46.670 --> 07:43:46.680 align:start position:0%
the state to have this connection that
 
07:43:48.910 --> 07:43:48.920 align:start position:0%
they took many Properties by imminent
 
07:43:51.750 --> 07:43:51.760 align:start position:0%
domain and cut through school district
 
07:43:53.750 --> 07:43:53.760 align:start position:0%
property leaving the Thorton's
 
07:43:55.868 --> 07:43:55.878 align:start position:0%
Elementary School on one side of the
 
07:43:57.868 --> 07:43:57.878 align:start position:0%
road and what could have been playing
 
07:44:00.830 --> 07:44:00.840 align:start position:0%
fields for the school on the other other
 
07:44:03.430 --> 07:44:03.440 align:start position:0%
their their overs salting of this road
 
07:44:06.468 --> 07:44:06.478 align:start position:0%
caused the contamination of public well
 
07:44:08.788 --> 07:44:08.798 align:start position:0%
that forced our water municipality to
 
07:44:10.830 --> 07:44:10.840 align:start position:0%
spend hundreds of thousands of dollars
 
07:44:14.468 --> 07:44:14.478 align:start position:0%
to replace now after all this cost that
 
07:44:16.830 --> 07:44:16.840 align:start position:0%
miramac has had to absorb and lost
 
07:44:19.190 --> 07:44:19.200 align:start position:0%
property tax revenues from the imminent
 
07:44:21.990 --> 07:44:22.000 align:start position:0%
domain the state wants our property
 
07:44:25.070 --> 07:44:25.080 align:start position:0%
taxpayers to make up for their lost
 
07:44:28.788 --> 07:44:28.798 align:start position:0%
Revenue also decades ago the town agreed
 
07:44:31.708 --> 07:44:31.718 align:start position:0%
to a to on Exit 11 to pay for the
 
07:44:34.308 --> 07:44:34.318 align:start position:0%
construction of a ramp to serve the
 
07:44:36.990 --> 07:44:37.000 align:start position:0%
digital Equipment Corporation campus
 
07:44:38.948 --> 07:44:38.958 align:start position:0%
which is now Fidelity
 
07:44:42.388 --> 07:44:42.398 align:start position:0%
Investments That toll was to remain up
 
07:44:44.788 --> 07:44:44.798 align:start position:0%
until the bond the construction bond for
 
07:44:49.830 --> 07:44:49.840 align:start position:0%
the ramp was paid for however do has
 
07:44:52.590 --> 07:44:52.600 align:start position:0%
refinanced that Bond at least twice for
 
07:44:55.388 --> 07:44:55.398 align:start position:0%
other purposes even though the actual
 
07:44:58.150 --> 07:44:58.160 align:start position:0%
ramp construction costs were paid many
 
07:45:00.910 --> 07:45:00.920 align:start position:0%
years ago so so it was only fair for
 
07:45:04.388 --> 07:45:04.398 align:start position:0%
that toll to come down so let's look at
 
07:45:08.308 --> 07:45:08.318 align:start position:0%
the majority report that is on page 35
 
07:45:10.990 --> 07:45:11.000 align:start position:0%
of today of this week's calendar it
 
07:45:14.388 --> 07:45:14.398 align:start position:0%
states over the past several years due
 
07:45:16.910 --> 07:45:16.920 align:start position:0%
to the decrease in traffic volume and
 
07:45:19.990 --> 07:45:20.000 align:start position:0%
the elimination of toll plazas Turnpike
 
07:45:23.230 --> 07:45:23.240 align:start position:0%
Revenue has declined considerably based
 
07:45:25.830 --> 07:45:25.840 align:start position:0%
on declining Turnpike revenues and other
 
07:45:28.230 --> 07:45:28.240 align:start position:0%
historical reasons the majority
 
07:45:30.110 --> 07:45:30.120 align:start position:0%
committee Amendment calls for the
 
07:45:32.270 --> 07:45:32.280 align:start position:0%
transfer of ownership of Continental
 
07:45:35.190 --> 07:45:35.200 align:start position:0%
Boulevard to the town of
 
07:45:38.990 --> 07:45:39.000 align:start position:0%
marac why should local property
 
07:45:42.628 --> 07:45:42.638 align:start position:0%
taxpayers shoulder the cost of declining
 
07:45:42.638 --> 07:45:44.750 align:start position:0%
taxpayers shoulder the cost of declining
Turnpike

07:45:44.750 --> 07:45:44.760 align:start position:0%
Turnpike
 
07:45:48.830 --> 07:45:48.840 align:start position:0%
Revenue turnpikes by definition are paid
 
07:45:50.430 --> 07:45:50.440 align:start position:0%
for by
 
07:45:53.868 --> 07:45:53.878 align:start position:0%
users however the first third of the
 
07:45:56.708 --> 07:45:56.718 align:start position:0%
Everett Turnpike and the most traveled
 
07:45:59.868 --> 07:45:59.878 align:start position:0%
section is from the Massachusetts state
 
07:46:04.030 --> 07:46:04.040 align:start position:0%
line to Exit 8 this stretch has never
 
07:46:07.750 --> 07:46:07.760 align:start position:0%
had a toll despite an earlier 10year
 
07:46:11.070 --> 07:46:11.080 align:start position:0%
Transportation plan that called for one
 
07:46:13.830 --> 07:46:13.840 align:start position:0%
along with extensive improvements which
 
07:46:15.670 --> 07:46:15.680 align:start position:0%
were comp which were already
 
07:46:20.350 --> 07:46:20.360 align:start position:0%
completed so new ramps Road widening a
 
07:46:22.150 --> 07:46:22.160 align:start position:0%
bridge to connect to the bridge that
 
07:46:25.830 --> 07:46:25.840 align:start position:0%
goes to Hudson and toll infrastructure
 
07:46:29.510 --> 07:46:29.520 align:start position:0%
was constructed if this toll station was
 
07:46:31.948 --> 07:46:31.958 align:start position:0%
put into operation as was planned in
 
07:46:34.990 --> 07:46:35.000 align:start position:0%
that 10-year Transportation study that
 
07:46:37.750 --> 07:46:37.760 align:start position:0%
Revenue would be more than enough to
 
07:46:41.070 --> 07:46:41.080 align:start position:0%
cover the turnpike costs but the users
 
07:46:44.070 --> 07:46:44.080 align:start position:0%
of that stretch of Turnpike have paid
 
07:46:47.468 --> 07:46:47.478 align:start position:0%
nothing zero zilch
 
07:46:52.070 --> 07:46:52.080 align:start position:0%
NADA it is so unfair to have one town
 
07:46:54.830 --> 07:46:54.840 align:start position:0%
pay so the majority of users on a
 
07:46:58.788 --> 07:46:58.798 align:start position:0%
Turnpike don't have to please vote green
 
07:47:01.788 --> 07:47:01.798 align:start position:0%
to pass this amendment thank
 
07:47:14.750 --> 07:47:14.760 align:start position:0%
 
07:47:20.030 --> 07:47:20.040 align:start position:0%
mcari thank you Mr Speaker and esteem
 
07:47:22.230 --> 07:47:22.240 align:start position:0%
colleagues while you are not accustomed
 
07:47:24.190 --> 07:47:24.200 align:start position:0%
to seeing the chair of Public Works and
 
07:47:26.868 --> 07:47:26.878 align:start position:0%
highways in the well there's a very good
 
07:47:28.110 --> 07:47:28.120 align:start position:0%
reason for
 
07:47:31.110 --> 07:47:31.120 align:start position:0%
that and in our committee there is not a
 
07:47:34.830 --> 07:47:34.840 align:start position:0%
partisan bone in our Collective body we
 
07:47:38.510 --> 07:47:38.520 align:start position:0%
work together reason among ourselves and
 
07:47:42.308 --> 07:47:42.318 align:start position:0%
nearly always reach a unanimous decision
 
07:47:45.030 --> 07:47:45.040 align:start position:0%
that results with our bills on the
 
07:47:45.040 --> 07:47:47.190 align:start position:0%
that results with our bills on the
consent

07:47:47.190 --> 07:47:47.200 align:start position:0%
consent
 
07:47:50.388 --> 07:47:50.398 align:start position:0%
Bill Public Works and highways has two
 
07:47:52.788 --> 07:47:52.798 align:start position:0%
charges on the even years we bring
 
07:47:55.788 --> 07:47:55.798 align:start position:0%
forward the 10-year Transportation plan
 
07:47:58.548 --> 07:47:58.558 align:start position:0%
and on the odd year we provide the state
 
07:48:00.830 --> 07:48:00.840 align:start position:0%
capital budget
 
07:48:03.510 --> 07:48:03.520 align:start position:0%
before you today is House Bill
 
07:48:06.670 --> 07:48:06.680 align:start position:0%
2024 and the only point of contention is
 
07:48:08.990 --> 07:48:09.000 align:start position:0%
floor Amendment
 
07:48:12.510 --> 07:48:12.520 align:start position:0%
1269 to stop the reclassification of
 
07:48:15.308 --> 07:48:15.318 align:start position:0%
Continental Boulevard in the town of
 
07:48:20.070 --> 07:48:20.080 align:start position:0%
aramac from becoming a town maintained
 
07:48:23.110 --> 07:48:23.120 align:start position:0%
road to defend the committee's p
 
07:48:25.388 --> 07:48:25.398 align:start position:0%
position I will offer a bit of
 
07:48:27.308 --> 07:48:27.318 align:start position:0%
background for your

consideration while the turnpike system
 
07:48:33.190 --> 07:48:33.200 align:start position:0%
receives limited federal funds it is
 
07:48:35.990 --> 07:48:36.000 align:start position:0%
primarily funded through the toll
 
07:48:39.190 --> 07:48:39.200 align:start position:0%
Revenue nearly 30 years ago the town of
 
07:48:42.548 --> 07:48:42.558 align:start position:0%
meramac requested the turnpike to
 
07:48:45.708 --> 07:48:45.718 align:start position:0%
construct ramps to provide access for
 
07:48:50.270 --> 07:48:50.280 align:start position:0%
its citizens to the turnpike system to
 
07:48:53.990 --> 07:48:54.000 align:start position:0%
alleviate traffic on Route three and to
 
07:48:56.308 --> 07:48:56.318 align:start position:0%
enable development in the areas
 
07:48:58.230 --> 07:48:58.240 align:start position:0%
surrounding the
 
07:49:01.510 --> 07:49:01.520 align:start position:0%
ramps the turnpike system did not have
 
07:49:05.788 --> 07:49:05.798 align:start position:0%
adequate funds to construct the access
 
07:49:10.150 --> 07:49:10.160 align:start position:0%
in order to advance the projects meramac
 
07:49:12.868 --> 07:49:12.878 align:start position:0%
agreed that the ramps would be
 
07:49:15.788 --> 07:49:15.798 align:start position:0%
told Continental Boulevard was
 
07:49:18.388 --> 07:49:18.398 align:start position:0%
constructed as part of exit 10
 
07:49:20.628 --> 07:49:20.638 align:start position:0%
Interchange to support major
 
07:49:23.788 --> 07:49:23.798 align:start position:0%
developments in the area and provide
 
07:49:27.110 --> 07:49:27.120 align:start position:0%
construction to both exit 10 Industrial
 
07:49:31.070 --> 07:49:31.080 align:start position:0%
Drive and Exit 11 via Continental
 
07:49:36.190 --> 07:49:36.200 align:start position:0%
Boulevard both exit 10 and 11 were
 
07:49:39.910 --> 07:49:39.920 align:start position:0%
told but over time the town advocated
 
07:49:43.230 --> 07:49:43.240 align:start position:0%
for the removal of tolls from exit 10 11
 
07:49:43.240 --> 07:49:43.990 align:start position:0%
for the removal of tolls from exit 10 11
and

07:49:43.990 --> 07:49:44.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
07:49:48.590 --> 07:49:48.600 align:start position:0%
12 resulting in a loss of nearly $1.6
 
07:49:52.868 --> 07:49:52.878 align:start position:0%
million a year in revenue and it cost
 
07:49:56.788 --> 07:49:56.798 align:start position:0%
the turnpike when they were removed $2.2
 
07:50:00.670 --> 07:50:00.680 align:start position:0%
million to remove those tolls
 
07:50:04.150 --> 07:50:04.160 align:start position:0%
insult to injury Continental Boulevard
 
07:50:07.270 --> 07:50:07.280 align:start position:0%
is not even connected to the turnpike
 
07:50:09.948 --> 07:50:09.958 align:start position:0%
but cost the turnpike
 
07:50:13.628 --> 07:50:13.638 align:start position:0%
$96,000 annually to maintain Continental
 
07:50:16.990 --> 07:50:17.000 align:start position:0%
Boulevard that only benefits
 
07:50:20.350 --> 07:50:20.360 align:start position:0%
marabac the turnpike cannot afford this
 
07:50:22.990 --> 07:50:23.000 align:start position:0%
expense without without offsetting

thank you Mr
 
07:53:07.628 --> 07:53:07.638 align:start position:0%
Speaker if I know that the Department of
 
07:53:10.308 --> 07:53:10.318 align:start position:0%
Transportation seeks to make up for a
 
07:53:12.910 --> 07:53:12.920 align:start position:0%
deep a drop in toll Revenue by
 
07:53:15.708 --> 07:53:15.718 align:start position:0%
reclassifying Continental Boulevard and
 
07:53:18.110 --> 07:53:18.120 align:start position:0%
dumping ownership obligation and
 
07:53:20.468 --> 07:53:20.478 align:start position:0%
responsibility onto the town of
 
07:53:23.388 --> 07:53:23.398 align:start position:0%
miramac and if I know that the committee
 
07:53:25.590 --> 07:53:25.600 align:start position:0%
Amendment violates the Constitution Bill
 
07:53:28.308 --> 07:53:28.318 align:start position:0%
of Rights Article 28a creating the
 
07:53:30.830 --> 07:53:30.840 align:start position:0%
mother of all unfunded mandates that
 
07:53:32.990 --> 07:53:33.000 align:start position:0%
will unjustly increase property taxes
 
07:53:35.708 --> 07:53:35.718 align:start position:0%
for marac residents who will become
 
07:53:38.430 --> 07:53:38.440 align:start position:0%
responsible for maintenance costs such
 
07:53:42.270 --> 07:53:42.280 align:start position:0%
as the $1.8 million anticipated cost for
 
07:53:44.670 --> 07:53:44.680 align:start position:0%
repaving this road a sum that will
 
07:53:47.788 --> 07:53:47.798 align:start position:0%
exceed the entire Paving budget for the
 
07:53:50.868 --> 07:53:50.878 align:start position:0%
town and finally if I know that the New
 
07:53:53.628 --> 07:53:53.638 align:start position:0%
Hampshire M municipalities like mine and
 
07:53:55.308 --> 07:53:55.318 align:start position:0%
potentially yours at some point in the
 
07:53:58.150 --> 07:53:58.160 align:start position:0%
future should not be mandated to take on
 
07:54:01.190 --> 07:54:01.200 align:start position:0%
do resp responsibilities for state-owned
 
07:54:04.070 --> 07:54:04.080 align:start position:0%
roads that the town never wanted or
 
07:54:06.270 --> 07:54:06.280 align:start position:0%
owned in the first place that would I
 
07:54:08.628 --> 07:54:08.638 align:start position:0%
now press the green button to support
 
07:54:11.430 --> 07:54:11.440 align:start position:0%
adoption of this bipartisan Amendment
 
07:54:13.868 --> 07:54:13.878 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker chair recognize
 
07:54:19.468 --> 07:54:19.478 align:start position:0%
 
07:54:22.308 --> 07:54:22.318 align:start position:0%
inre thank you Mr
 
07:54:24.708 --> 07:54:24.718 align:start position:0%
Speaker if I know the New Hampshire
 
07:54:28.190 --> 07:54:28.200 align:start position:0%
Turnpike constructed ramps at exits 10
 
07:54:31.990 --> 07:54:32.000 align:start position:0%
11 and 12 for the ever Turnpike improved
 
07:54:35.868 --> 07:54:35.878 align:start position:0%
and extended an existing Town Road known
 
07:54:39.110 --> 07:54:39.120 align:start position:0%
as Camp Sergeant creating Continental
 
07:54:41.788 --> 07:54:41.798 align:start position:0%
Boulevard that relieved traffic on Route
 
07:54:44.948 --> 07:54:44.958 align:start position:0%
three and enabled economic development
 
07:54:47.830 --> 07:54:47.840 align:start position:0%
in those areas surrounding those ramps
 
07:54:51.670 --> 07:54:51.680 align:start position:0%
for the sole benefit of marac if I know
 
07:54:53.910 --> 07:54:53.920 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Turnpike only took on
 
07:54:56.948 --> 07:54:56.958 align:start position:0%
the major investment with the express
 
07:54:58.910 --> 07:54:58.920 align:start position:0%
understanding town of marac would permit
 
07:55:00.510 --> 07:55:00.520 align:start position:0%
tolls to be collected for those
 
07:55:03.388 --> 07:55:03.398 align:start position:0%
aforementioned ramps to pay for the
 
07:55:05.910 --> 07:55:05.920 align:start position:0%
construction and the continued
 
07:55:09.750 --> 07:55:09.760 align:start position:0%
maintenance and if I know that meramac
 
07:55:12.308 --> 07:55:12.318 align:start position:0%
later actively pursued and secured
 
07:55:15.548 --> 07:55:15.558 align:start position:0%
removal of the meramac tolls triggering
 
07:55:20.430 --> 07:55:20.440 align:start position:0%
a $1.6 million annual loss of tolls and
 
07:55:22.868 --> 07:55:22.878 align:start position:0%
the removal of those tolls locations
 
07:55:25.708 --> 07:55:25.718 align:start position:0%
cost the turnpike $2.1
 
07:55:28.628 --> 07:55:28.638 align:start position:0%
million and after all that the turnpike
 
07:55:31.670 --> 07:55:31.680 align:start position:0%
is left with an expense of
 
07:55:35.510 --> 07:55:35.520 align:start position:0%
$96,000 annual to maintain Continental
 
07:55:38.190 --> 07:55:38.200 align:start position:0%
Boulevard as mentioned local road that
 
07:55:41.190 --> 07:55:41.200 align:start position:0%
is not connected to the to the New
 
07:55:45.150 --> 07:55:45.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Turnpike system finally if you
 
07:55:46.590 --> 07:55:46.600 align:start position:0%
were not from
 
07:55:50.750 --> 07:55:50.760 align:start position:0%
marac and believe as I the town of maram
 
07:55:53.270 --> 07:55:53.280 align:start position:0%
should have fully considered the
 
07:55:56.670 --> 07:55:56.680 align:start position:0%
financial ramification for their town
 
07:56:00.468 --> 07:56:00.478 align:start position:0%
before they removed a state a revenue
 
07:56:02.948 --> 07:56:02.958 align:start position:0%
stream that would have fully funded the
 
07:56:06.190 --> 07:56:06.200 align:start position:0%
continue maintenance of their local Road

and Committee Member from marac uh at
 
08:01:04.350 --> 08:01:04.360 align:start position:0%
the committee meeting after we voted
 
08:01:06.708 --> 08:01:06.718 align:start position:0%
unanimously to pass the amendment you
 
08:01:08.910 --> 08:01:08.920 align:start position:0%
just voted on the Department of
 
08:01:11.628 --> 08:01:11.638 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services asked us uh to
 
08:01:13.948 --> 08:01:13.958 align:start position:0%
reconsider and to consider a floor
 
08:01:16.350 --> 08:01:16.360 align:start position:0%
Amendment they had suggested to the
 
08:01:18.750 --> 08:01:18.760 align:start position:0%
committee that they did not reach out to
 
08:01:21.430 --> 08:01:21.440 align:start position:0%
all the interested parties uh before
 
08:01:24.270 --> 08:01:24.280 align:start position:0%
they met with us with their suggestions
 
08:01:27.910 --> 08:01:27.920 align:start position:0%
so post our meeting and before today uh
 
08:01:30.070 --> 08:01:30.080 align:start position:0%
my fellow representative and I work with
 
08:01:32.350 --> 08:01:32.360 align:start position:0%
the Department of Environmental Services
 
08:01:35.388 --> 08:01:35.398 align:start position:0%
to make this amendment there's basically
 
08:01:38.910 --> 08:01:38.920 align:start position:0%
three changes in the amendment the time
 
08:01:41.788 --> 08:01:41.798 align:start position:0%
period for which a seller can give you
 
08:01:45.150 --> 08:01:45.160 align:start position:0%
their evaluation was reduced from 3
 
08:01:49.110 --> 08:01:49.120 align:start position:0%
years to 180 days or roughly 6 months
 
08:01:51.590 --> 08:01:51.600 align:start position:0%
the time which the buyer needs to
 
08:01:54.910 --> 08:01:54.920 align:start position:0%
replace a fail system was reduced from
 
08:01:58.150 --> 08:01:58.160 align:start position:0%
one year to 180 days or they say 6
 
08:01:58.160 --> 08:01:59.070 align:start position:0%
one year to 180 days or they say 6
months

08:01:59.070 --> 08:01:59.080 align:start position:0%
months
 
08:02:01.590 --> 08:02:01.600 align:start position:0%
I'm told that is consistent with a
 
08:02:05.030 --> 08:02:05.040 align:start position:0%
normal septic failure replacement time
 
08:02:07.510 --> 08:02:07.520 align:start position:0%
period so we're trying to be consistent
 
08:02:10.430 --> 08:02:10.440 align:start position:0%
with the D regulations so that was
 
08:02:13.230 --> 08:02:13.240 align:start position:0%
amended and the time period of which a
 
08:02:16.830 --> 08:02:16.840 align:start position:0%
failed system under Section six uh needs
 
08:02:18.788 --> 08:02:18.798 align:start position:0%
to be replaced that went from one year
 
08:02:22.070 --> 08:02:22.080 align:start position:0%
to 180 days it was suggested to us that
 
08:02:25.190 --> 08:02:25.200 align:start position:0%
again be consistent with the 180-day
 
08:02:27.750 --> 08:02:27.760 align:start position:0%
period but there's also as you'll note
 
08:02:31.750 --> 08:02:31.760 align:start position:0%
we remain the six-month extension in
 
08:02:35.430 --> 08:02:35.440 align:start position:0%
section 7 um so those are the basic
 
08:02:38.270 --> 08:02:38.280 align:start position:0%
changes they were supported uh by
 
08:02:40.910 --> 08:02:40.920 align:start position:0%
partisan with the committee members and
 
08:02:43.388 --> 08:02:43.398 align:start position:0%
also by the uh New Hampshire Department
 
08:02:45.590 --> 08:02:45.600 align:start position:0%
of Environmental Services so would ask
 
08:02:49.190 --> 08:02:49.200 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr
 
08:07:12.150 --> 08:07:12.160 align:start position:0%
Speaker if I know that this bill allows
 
08:07:15.468 --> 08:07:15.478 align:start position:0%
just 25 people not
 
08:07:18.750 --> 08:07:18.760 align:start position:0%
necessarily Lakefront
 
08:07:22.190 --> 08:07:22.200 align:start position:0%
owners to petition the department of
 
08:07:25.230 --> 08:07:25.240 align:start position:0%
safety to keep certain types of people
 
08:07:28.670 --> 08:07:28.680 align:start position:0%
and vessels off of their water
 
08:07:31.948 --> 08:07:31.958 align:start position:0%
water and if I noted the department of
 
08:07:35.270 --> 08:07:35.280 align:start position:0%
safety said that they do not have the
 
08:07:39.468 --> 08:07:39.478 align:start position:0%
resources to do this at all without fund
 
08:07:43.708 --> 08:07:43.718 align:start position:0%
extra funding then would I keep it clean
 
08:07:47.750 --> 08:07:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
08:07:50.468 --> 08:07:50.478 align:start position:0%
you J recognize representative Darby for
 
08:07:54.350 --> 08:07:54.360 align:start position:0%
 
08:07:57.548 --> 08:07:57.558 align:start position:0%
inquiry thank you Mr Speaker if I knew
 
08:07:59.948 --> 08:07:59.958 align:start position:0%
wake Sur can be an enjoyable sport for
 
08:08:02.628 --> 08:08:02.638 align:start position:0%
young and old but large wakes in Shallow
 
08:08:05.070 --> 08:08:05.080 align:start position:0%
sensitive areas of a lake can flood Lon
 
08:08:07.548 --> 08:08:07.558 align:start position:0%
nests encourage toxic cyanobacteria
 
08:08:09.468 --> 08:08:09.478 align:start position:0%
blooms and cause Shoreline property
 
08:08:12.308 --> 08:08:12.318 align:start position:0%
damage and Mr Speaker if I knew the
 
08:08:14.990 --> 08:08:15.000 align:start position:0%
amended bill was not a ban on wake
 
08:08:17.230 --> 08:08:17.240 align:start position:0%
surfing and it does not add broad
 
08:08:19.548 --> 08:08:19.558 align:start position:0%
restrictions but instead creates a
 
08:08:20.990 --> 08:08:21.000 align:start position:0%
process for the Department of Safety to
 
08:08:24.350 --> 08:08:24.360 align:start position:0%
hold hearings with existing staff to
 
08:08:27.070 --> 08:08:27.080 align:start position:0%
protect these sensitive areas as it does
 
08:08:28.708 --> 08:08:28.718 align:start position:0%
as it currently does for speed limit
 
08:08:31.270 --> 08:08:31.280 align:start position:0%
restrictions and finally Mr Speaker if I
 
08:08:33.110 --> 08:08:33.120 align:start position:0%
knew the department of safety must
 
08:08:35.388 --> 08:08:35.398 align:start position:0%
balance the right to public access to
 
08:08:37.788 --> 08:08:37.798 align:start position:0%
lakes with safety concerns for people
 
08:08:39.750 --> 08:08:39.760 align:start position:0%
and property as well as environmental
 
08:08:41.948 --> 08:08:41.958 align:start position:0%

incorrect thank you Mr Speaker Mr

Speaker if I know that this is a top-
 
08:19:45.430 --> 08:19:45.440 align:start position:0%
down zoning change mandated by the state
 
08:19:47.110 --> 08:19:47.120 align:start position:0%
if I also know that all towns are
 
08:19:48.628 --> 08:19:48.638 align:start position:0%
different and one size fits-all
 
08:19:50.868 --> 08:19:50.878 align:start position:0%
Solutions never work therefore why these
 
08:19:52.388 --> 08:19:52.398 align:start position:0%
these therefore these things should be
 
08:19:54.868 --> 08:19:54.878 align:start position:0%
decided at the local level if I know
 
08:19:56.788 --> 08:19:56.798 align:start position:0%
this bill expands our current Adu
 
08:19:58.670 --> 08:19:58.680 align:start position:0%
statute by forcing towns to allow a

fet on any single family lot over half
 
08:20:08.468 --> 08:20:08.478 align:start position:0%
an acre which potentially converts
 
08:20:10.590 --> 08:20:10.600 align:start position:0%
single family lots into three unit
 
08:20:13.750 --> 08:20:13.760 align:start position:0%
rental properties Mr Speaker finally if
 
08:20:16.070 --> 08:20:16.080 align:start position:0%
I know that simple corrections to our
 
08:20:18.708 --> 08:20:18.718 align:start position:0%
current law our current Adu law without
 
08:20:21.308 --> 08:20:21.318 align:start position:0%
the expansion would probably would have
 
08:20:24.350 --> 08:20:24.360 align:start position:0%

runoff in other words storm drains
 
08:24:06.510 --> 08:24:06.520 align:start position:0%
they're not
 
08:24:10.228 --> 08:24:10.238 align:start position:0%
separate into a single pipe all the rest
 
08:24:14.110 --> 08:24:14.120 align:start position:0%
 
08:24:17.110 --> 08:24:17.120 align:start position:0%
separate Manchester is currently going
 
08:24:20.190 --> 08:24:20.200 align:start position:0%
through a 20year
 
08:24:25.070 --> 08:24:25.080 align:start position:0%
335 million project to separate these
 
08:24:28.190 --> 08:24:28.200 align:start position:0%
lines the reason this is being done is
 
08:24:29.548 --> 08:24:29.558 align:start position:0%
because in
 
08:24:33.830 --> 08:24:33.840 align:start position:0%
2005 the EPA filed against
 
08:24:37.070 --> 08:24:37.080 align:start position:0%
Nashua and Manchester for polluting the
 
08:24:37.080 --> 08:24:39.350 align:start position:0%
Nashua and Manchester for polluting the
miramac

08:24:39.350 --> 08:24:39.360 align:start position:0%
miramac
 
08:24:42.070 --> 08:24:42.080 align:start position:0%
river we have not cleared that yet if
 
08:24:43.788 --> 08:24:43.798 align:start position:0%
you've read in the news you would see
 
08:24:46.868 --> 08:24:46.878 align:start position:0%
that we have dumped 20 million gallons
 
08:24:52.548 --> 08:24:52.558 align:start position:0%
of w of waste water into the marac from
 
08:24:55.070 --> 08:24:55.080 align:start position:0%
Nashua and
 
08:24:58.510 --> 08:24:58.520 align:start position:0%
875 million gallon gallons of combined
 
08:25:02.030 --> 08:25:02.040 align:start position:0%
Wastewater from Manchester that's over
 
08:25:04.910 --> 08:25:04.920 align:start position:0%
three times the amount at which we were
 
08:25:07.910 --> 08:25:07.920 align:start position:0%
find in the first place for polluting
 
08:25:10.788 --> 08:25:10.798 align:start position:0%
the river so we've exceeded all
 
08:25:13.670 --> 08:25:13.680 align:start position:0%
expectations for being able to
 
08:25:16.868 --> 08:25:16.878 align:start position:0%
pollute and that's just last year and it
 
08:25:16.878 --> 08:25:19.468 align:start position:0%
pollute and that's just last year and it
rained

08:25:19.468 --> 08:25:19.478 align:start position:0%
 
08:25:23.830 --> 08:25:23.840 align:start position:0%
today Nash River wasn't even included in
 
08:25:25.830 --> 08:25:25.840 align:start position:0%
the 20 million
 
08:25:25.840 --> 08:25:28.030 align:start position:0%
the 20 million
gallons

08:25:28.030 --> 08:25:28.040 align:start position:0%
gallons
 
08:25:30.868 --> 08:25:30.878 align:start position:0%
we have nine now what when H when what
 
08:25:35.430 --> 08:25:35.440 align:start position:0%
happens with uh combined uh sewer pipes
 
08:25:37.948 --> 08:25:37.958 align:start position:0%
is they reach something called a CSO in
 
08:25:41.590 --> 08:25:41.600 align:start position:0%
other words a combined sewer overflow
 
08:25:44.430 --> 08:25:44.440 align:start position:0%
Point that's the point at which it
 
08:25:47.788 --> 08:25:47.798 align:start position:0%
cannot no longer siphon all of it down
 
08:25:51.548 --> 08:25:51.558 align:start position:0%
into the um treatment plants and so it
 
08:25:54.308 --> 08:25:54.318 align:start position:0%
just gets dumped out into the river I'm
 
08:25:55.948 --> 08:25:55.958 align:start position:0%
not going to take your time explaining
 
08:25:57.388 --> 08:25:57.398 align:start position:0%
that although I did read research it a
 
08:25:59.628 --> 08:25:59.638 align:start position:0%
lot and it's really cool and there are
 
08:26:02.510 --> 08:26:02.520 align:start position:0%
some benefits to that combination but we
 
08:26:04.510 --> 08:26:04.520 align:start position:0%
far exceeded the ability to be able to
 
08:26:08.228 --> 08:26:08.238 align:start position:0%
handle that anymore so the problem we
 
08:26:12.430 --> 08:26:12.440 align:start position:0%
now have as a result of the 2005 finding
 
08:26:15.190 --> 08:26:15.200 align:start position:0%
is that we have to fix this we've been
 
08:26:17.830 --> 08:26:17.840 align:start position:0%
mandated to fix it the state of New
 
08:26:20.510 --> 08:26:20.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has not spent any money on
 
08:26:24.510 --> 08:26:24.520 align:start position:0%
this the town's taxes have to pay for it
 
08:26:27.788 --> 08:26:27.798 align:start position:0%
Manchester as I indicated have to pay
 
08:26:31.830 --> 08:26:31.840 align:start position:0%
335 million since it's a 25e project
 
08:26:33.788 --> 08:26:33.798 align:start position:0%
it's 20-year project it's probably going
 
08:26:36.830 --> 08:26:36.840 align:start position:0%
to overrun and that's the way life is
 
08:26:39.590 --> 08:26:39.600 align:start position:0%
Nashua was told that in order to fix
 
08:26:42.270 --> 08:26:42.280 align:start position:0%
what was left of the third as I said
 
08:26:44.830 --> 08:26:44.840 align:start position:0%
that we had 300 miles of sewer there was
 
08:26:48.308 --> 08:26:48.318 align:start position:0%
only 10% uh 30% of that is in an in the
 
08:26:50.708 --> 08:26:50.718 align:start position:0%
area called the inner city it was going
 
08:26:54.468 --> 08:26:54.478 align:start position:0%
to cost another 225 million to separate
 
08:26:57.548 --> 08:26:57.558 align:start position:0%
those pipes into waste water order and
 
08:26:57.558 --> 08:26:58.670 align:start position:0%
those pipes into waste water order and
run

08:26:58.670 --> 08:26:58.680 align:start position:0%
run
 
08:27:01.150 --> 08:27:01.160 align:start position:0%
off nashaa said they couldn't afford it
 
08:27:02.510 --> 08:27:02.520 align:start position:0%
they just didn't have the money so they
 
08:27:04.510 --> 08:27:04.520 align:start position:0%
came up with another
 
08:27:07.590 --> 08:27:07.600 align:start position:0%
plan the plan in Nashua to handle this
 
08:27:09.510 --> 08:27:09.520 align:start position:0%
and it will get fixed over the next 10
 
08:27:11.468 --> 08:27:11.478 align:start position:0%
years it hasn't been fixed yet because
 
08:27:14.150 --> 08:27:14.160 align:start position:0%
we're still dumping the plan over the
 
08:27:17.750 --> 08:27:17.760 align:start position:0%
next 10 years is the inner city portion
 
08:27:20.228 --> 08:27:20.238 align:start position:0%
keeps the pipes together we will never
 
08:27:23.308 --> 08:27:23.318 align:start position:0%
separate them out but the portion that's
 
08:27:26.070 --> 08:27:26.080 align:start position:0%
in the rest of nsha they're fine and
 
08:27:28.190 --> 08:27:28.200 align:start position:0%
they have and and they work well with
 
08:27:31.788 --> 08:27:31.798 align:start position:0%
the very the upgraded and ex $69 million
 
08:27:34.868 --> 08:27:34.878 align:start position:0%
Nash was spent uh a few years back to
 
08:27:37.590 --> 08:27:37.600 align:start position:0%
upgrade the sewer facility I'm sorry
 
08:27:39.750 --> 08:27:39.760 align:start position:0%
they upgrade the treatment facility and
 
08:27:43.308 --> 08:27:43.318 align:start position:0%
to put a 40,000 gallon uh holding tank
 
08:27:45.910 --> 08:27:45.920 align:start position:0%
to be able to hold some of that runoff
 
08:27:48.548 --> 08:27:48.558 align:start position:0%
but as I said the runoff is now three
 
08:27:51.270 --> 08:27:51.280 align:start position:0%
over three times what was ever expected
 
08:27:53.350 --> 08:27:53.360 align:start position:0%
for it to be able to
 
08:27:59.548 --> 08:27:59.558 align:start position:0%
 
08:28:02.110 --> 08:28:02.120 align:start position:0%
consists of pipes and you can read it on
 
08:28:04.430 --> 08:28:04.440 align:start position:0%
the map I'm not making this up although
 
08:28:06.910 --> 08:28:06.920 align:start position:0%
I was incredibly surprised to find out
 
08:28:10.830 --> 08:28:10.840 align:start position:0%
myself are made out of clay they're made
 
08:28:12.350 --> 08:28:12.360 align:start position:0%
out of
 
08:28:15.388 --> 08:28:15.398 align:start position:0%
brick they're made out of
 
08:28:17.990 --> 08:28:18.000 align:start position:0%
cement they're fragile and they're as
 
08:28:21.590 --> 08:28:21.600 align:start position:0%
old as being installed In
 
08:28:24.510 --> 08:28:24.520 align:start position:0%
1855 the town doesn't want to touch them
 
08:28:26.270 --> 08:28:26.280 align:start position:0%
because if they do they're afraid that
 
08:28:28.708 --> 08:28:28.718 align:start position:0%
the whole thing will just fall apart
 
08:28:30.548 --> 08:28:30.558 align:start position:0%
although I that's my reading on it I
 
08:28:31.708 --> 08:28:31.718 align:start position:0%
mean I think they don't want to do it
 
08:28:33.670 --> 08:28:33.680 align:start position:0%
because it cost $250
 
08:28:36.350 --> 08:28:36.360 align:start position:0%
million the streets in this area are
 
08:28:38.990 --> 08:28:39.000 align:start position:0%
narrow the kind of excavation equipment
 
08:28:41.150 --> 08:28:41.160 align:start position:0%
you have to get down those streets is
 
08:28:41.160 --> 08:28:42.910 align:start position:0%
you have to get down those streets is
probably

08:28:42.910 --> 08:28:42.920 align:start position:0%
probably
 
08:28:45.270 --> 08:28:45.280 align:start position:0%
impossible as some of Manchester is
 
08:28:47.628 --> 08:28:47.638 align:start position:0%
finding out right now it's it's a
 
08:28:49.830 --> 08:28:49.840 align:start position:0%
disaster but not a disaster that's going
 
08:28:51.868 --> 08:28:51.878 align:start position:0%
to be forever you know you move on from
 
08:28:54.788 --> 08:28:54.798 align:start position:0%
each Street at a little bit at a
 
08:28:58.548 --> 08:28:58.558 align:start position:0%
time the idea of all of a sudden letting
 
08:29:01.150 --> 08:29:01.160 align:start position:0%
individuals take it upon themselves to
 
08:29:05.150 --> 08:29:05.160 align:start position:0%
add adus in an area that is so
 
08:29:07.990 --> 08:29:08.000 align:start position:0%
fragile and is not in the process has
 
08:29:10.830 --> 08:29:10.840 align:start position:0%
not completed their their uh pollution
 
08:29:13.628 --> 08:29:13.638 align:start position:0%
prevention that has been mandated by the
 
08:29:16.228 --> 08:29:16.238 align:start position:0%
EPA and the fact that the state of New
 
08:29:18.110 --> 08:29:18.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is not going to help them do
 
08:29:21.190 --> 08:29:21.200 align:start position:0%
one bit of this and our taxpayers have
 
08:29:24.228 --> 08:29:24.238 align:start position:0%
to pay between the two cities over a
 
08:29:26.910 --> 08:29:26.920 align:start position:0%
billion dollars to straighten this out
 
08:29:29.590 --> 08:29:29.600 align:start position:0%
seems to me we don't need another state
 
08:29:31.990 --> 08:29:32.000 align:start position:0%
mandate we got enough mandates we're
 
08:29:35.350 --> 08:29:35.360 align:start position:0%
reeling from under it one of the other
 
08:29:37.070 --> 08:29:37.080 align:start position:0%
problems we have in nsha and I don't
 
08:29:38.468 --> 08:29:38.478 align:start position:0%
know if they have this problem in
 
08:29:41.110 --> 08:29:41.120 align:start position:0%
Manchester is that our our supply of
 
08:29:45.350 --> 08:29:45.360 align:start position:0%
water in this inner city area is so old
 
08:29:49.430 --> 08:29:49.440 align:start position:0%
that the best we can get is 18 PSI in
 
08:29:53.070 --> 08:29:53.080 align:start position:0%
this inner city area 18 PSI is not
 
08:29:55.548 --> 08:29:55.558 align:start position:0%
enough to take a
 
08:29:59.190 --> 08:29:59.200 align:start position:0%
shower we don't have the ability to
 
08:30:02.070 --> 08:30:02.080 align:start position:0%
operate and just let individuals do this
 
08:30:04.030 --> 08:30:04.040 align:start position:0%
sort of thing now that this bill would
 
08:30:06.510 --> 08:30:06.520 align:start position:0%
let you believe that the town has done
 
08:30:09.990 --> 08:30:10.000 align:start position:0%
nothing for housing uh nasua has put in
 
08:30:12.788 --> 08:30:12.798 align:start position:0%
over 2,000 housing units in the last two
 
08:30:14.830 --> 08:30:14.840 align:start position:0%
years alone but they've been able to
 
08:30:17.750 --> 08:30:17.760 align:start position:0%
rate the p uh rate uh route the pipes to
 
08:30:21.750 --> 08:30:21.760 align:start position:0%
an area that has split runoff and split
 
08:30:25.990 --> 08:30:26.000 align:start position:0%
sewer not in the middle of for area the
 
08:30:28.548 --> 08:30:28.558 align:start position:0%
uh that we're talking
 
08:30:31.510 --> 08:30:31.520 align:start position:0%
for that's okay you probably couldn't
 
08:30:33.548 --> 08:30:33.558 align:start position:0%
hear me cuz I can't really hear you
 
08:30:35.430 --> 08:30:35.440 align:start position:0%
which is shocking considering only about
 
08:30:37.590 --> 08:30:37.600 align:start position:0%
half the members are in here we please
 
08:30:39.948 --> 08:30:39.958 align:start position:0%
keep it quiet and minimize holding the
 
08:30:45.548 --> 08:30:45.558 align:start position:0%
 
08:30:48.750 --> 08:30:48.760 align:start position:0%
ahead as I said we don't need another
 
08:30:51.788 --> 08:30:51.798 align:start position:0%
mandate telling us that we have to take
 
08:30:55.228 --> 08:30:55.238 align:start position:0%
on individuals not being allow being
 
08:30:57.110 --> 08:30:57.120 align:start position:0%
allowed to do what they want with their
 
08:30:59.468 --> 08:30:59.478 align:start position:0%
with their properties as far as
 
08:31:02.388 --> 08:31:02.398 align:start position:0%
impacting the the the sewer system that
 
08:31:04.830 --> 08:31:04.840 align:start position:0%
we all share and that we depend on in
 
08:31:08.750 --> 08:31:08.760 align:start position:0%
this inner city area other areas of nsha
 
08:31:10.590 --> 08:31:10.600 align:start position:0%
maybe something can be done maybe it's
 
08:31:13.548 --> 08:31:13.558 align:start position:0%
okay but we need to plan because this
 
08:31:16.228 --> 08:31:16.238 align:start position:0%
area is so fragile that we don't have
 
08:31:19.070 --> 08:31:19.080 align:start position:0%
much that we don't have until they fix
 
08:31:21.430 --> 08:31:21.440 align:start position:0%
the rest of the uh dumping
 
08:31:23.430 --> 08:31:23.440 align:start position:0%
problem we're just going to keep getting
 
08:31:24.910 --> 08:31:24.920 align:start position:0%
fined by the
 
08:31:27.590 --> 08:31:27.600 align:start position:0%
EPA and as I say the state isn't helping
 
08:31:30.430 --> 08:31:30.440 align:start position:0%
with that also I said mentioned that the
 
08:31:32.750 --> 08:31:32.760 align:start position:0%
water system we have every time new
 
08:31:35.270 --> 08:31:35.280 align:start position:0%
houses are put on this water system our
 
08:31:38.110 --> 08:31:38.120 align:start position:0%
 
08:31:40.868 --> 08:31:40.878 align:start position:0%
down we just don't have the facility in
 
08:31:44.468 --> 08:31:44.478 align:start position:0%
this area other areas do and so other
 
08:31:46.708 --> 08:31:46.718 align:start position:0%
areas could be planned for more housing
 
08:31:48.788 --> 08:31:48.798 align:start position:0%
and could be planned but as I say nashar
 
08:31:51.990 --> 08:31:52.000 align:start position:0%
has put in over 2,000 new housing units
 
08:31:54.430 --> 08:31:54.440 align:start position:0%
and they've done it by routing the water
 
08:31:57.388 --> 08:31:57.398 align:start position:0%
and the and the uh sewer from another
 
08:32:01.468 --> 08:32:01.478 align:start position:0%
area not from inside of our inner city
 
08:32:04.190 --> 08:32:04.200 align:start position:0%
area this is all part of planning this
 
08:32:06.830 --> 08:32:06.840 align:start position:0%
is what this is the way what planners do
 
08:32:09.868 --> 08:32:09.878 align:start position:0%
we can't take that away from them and so
 
08:32:12.788 --> 08:32:12.798 align:start position:0%
I'm asking you to itl this
 
08:32:16.110 --> 08:32:16.120 align:start position:0%
uh this bill and I would ask for a
 
08:32:16.120 --> 08:32:20.030 align:start position:0%
uh this bill and I would ask for a
division

08:32:20.030 --> 08:32:20.040 align:start position:0%
 
08:32:22.590 --> 08:32:22.600 align:start position:0%
vote representative turkos recognize
 
08:32:25.430 --> 08:32:25.440 align:start position:0%
 
08:32:25.440 --> 08:32:30.868 align:start position:0%
 
report

08:32:30.868 --> 08:32:30.878 align:start position:0%
 
08:32:33.708 --> 08:32:33.718 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker I want to start out
 
08:32:36.750 --> 08:32:36.760 align:start position:0%
by saying one thing dispelling a
 
08:32:39.070 --> 08:32:39.080 align:start position:0%
misconception out there that this is
 
08:32:40.628 --> 08:32:40.638 align:start position:0%
something about this bill is something
 
08:32:42.510 --> 08:32:42.520 align:start position:0%
about property
 
08:32:44.990 --> 08:32:45.000 align:start position:0%
rights the only people's property rights
 
08:32:46.590 --> 08:32:46.600 align:start position:0%
are who are going to be negatively
 
08:32:48.270 --> 08:32:48.280 align:start position:0%
affected are those who are going to be
 
08:32:50.868 --> 08:32:50.878 align:start position:0%
affected by the mandates that the state
 
08:32:54.788 --> 08:32:54.798 align:start position:0%
is handing down this is zoning by the
 
08:32:58.388 --> 08:32:58.398 align:start position:0%
state this is not property
 
08:33:00.708 --> 08:33:00.718 align:start position:0%
rights if you want to talk about giving
 
08:33:02.228 --> 08:33:02.238 align:start position:0%
property rights back to the people I've
 
08:33:04.788 --> 08:33:04.798 align:start position:0%
got a great solution let's put forth
 
08:33:07.868 --> 08:33:07.878 align:start position:0%
a a bill that actually just eliminates
 
08:33:10.628 --> 08:33:10.638 align:start position:0%
all zoning take care of it you get your
 
08:33:11.910 --> 08:33:11.920 align:start position:0%
property rights back I don't think there
 
08:33:13.468 --> 08:33:13.478 align:start position:0%
have been too many people are going to
 
08:33:16.110 --> 08:33:16.120 align:start position:0%
be going along with
 
08:33:19.388 --> 08:33:19.398 align:start position:0%
that the current rsas allow the
 
08:33:21.628 --> 08:33:21.638 align:start position:0%
municipality to make zoning changes with
 
08:33:24.350 --> 08:33:24.360 align:start position:0%
the war and article process that is
 
08:33:24.360 --> 08:33:25.308 align:start position:0%
the war and article process that is
local

08:33:25.308 --> 08:33:25.318 align:start position:0%
local
 
08:33:25.318 --> 08:33:26.910 align:start position:0%
local
control

08:33:26.910 --> 08:33:26.920 align:start position:0%
control
 
08:33:29.308 --> 08:33:29.318 align:start position:0%
that is what the municipal and County
 
08:33:31.190 --> 08:33:31.200 align:start position:0%
government committee consistently
 
08:33:34.510 --> 08:33:34.520 align:start position:0%
applies when we talk about zoning and
 
08:33:36.708 --> 08:33:36.718 align:start position:0%
the nhma strongly
 
08:33:39.708 --> 08:33:39.718 align:start position:0%
endorses that concept of local
 
08:33:41.910 --> 08:33:41.920 align:start position:0%
control so what does this bill attempt
 
08:33:43.788 --> 08:33:43.798 align:start position:0%
to force on
 
08:33:46.548 --> 08:33:46.558 align:start position:0%
municipalities allows two adus now it
 
08:33:48.190 --> 08:33:48.200 align:start position:0%
used to be one now you're going to have
 
08:33:51.548 --> 08:33:51.558 align:start position:0%
two one attached one unattached it
 
08:33:54.110 --> 08:33:54.120 align:start position:0%
increases the size of the first one hey
 
08:33:55.308 --> 08:33:55.318 align:start position:0%
you got a
 
08:33:58.190 --> 08:33:58.200 align:start position:0%
garage make it an an
 
08:34:00.948 --> 08:34:00.958 align:start position:0%
Adu have a space above a
 
08:34:03.788 --> 08:34:03.798 align:start position:0%
garage convert that to a second
 
08:34:06.708 --> 08:34:06.718 align:start position:0%
Adu have some ex have a big shed in the
 
08:34:08.670 --> 08:34:08.680 align:start position:0%
backyard hey do a little work on that
 
08:34:11.270 --> 08:34:11.280 align:start position:0%
and convert that to an
 
08:34:13.628 --> 08:34:13.638 align:start position:0%
Adu now according to the some of the
 
08:34:16.030 --> 08:34:16.040 align:start position:0%
language in there also it says the
 
08:34:18.510 --> 08:34:18.520 align:start position:0%
second Adu shall be required to meet the
 
08:34:21.150 --> 08:34:21.160 align:start position:0%
definition of Workforce
 
08:34:23.868 --> 08:34:23.878 align:start position:0%
housing and shall be required to meet
 
08:34:26.430 --> 08:34:26.440 align:start position:0%
the definition of affordable as defined
 
08:34:27.388 --> 08:34:27.398 align:start position:0%
in the
 
08:34:30.468 --> 08:34:30.478 align:start position:0%
rsas we just killed a bill here a couple
 
08:34:33.270 --> 08:34:33.280 align:start position:0%
weeks ago regarding rent
 
08:34:36.190 --> 08:34:36.200 align:start position:0%
control on the smaller
 
08:34:40.350 --> 08:34:40.360 align:start position:0%
lots a primary residence your 2 adus
 
08:34:43.070 --> 08:34:43.080 align:start position:0%
could P potentially take up nearly every
 
08:34:45.350 --> 08:34:45.360 align:start position:0%
square foot of that
 
08:34:48.190 --> 08:34:48.200 align:start position:0%
property so where are the cars going to
 
08:34:48.200 --> 08:34:50.750 align:start position:0%
property so where are the cars going to
park

08:34:50.750 --> 08:34:50.760 align:start position:0%
park
 
08:34:53.388 --> 08:34:53.398 align:start position:0%
well this language takes care of that
 
08:34:56.388 --> 08:34:56.398 align:start position:0%
and this is what it says at a legally
 
08:34:59.150 --> 08:34:59.160 align:start position:0%
dedicated offsite location at the
 
08:35:02.030 --> 08:35:02.040 align:start position:0%
property owner's discretion so where is
 
08:35:02.990 --> 08:35:03.000 align:start position:0%
that going to be is it going to be a
 
08:35:05.868 --> 08:35:05.878 align:start position:0%
block away two blocks away half a mile
 
08:35:08.670 --> 08:35:08.680 align:start position:0%
away a mile away or is it more likely
 
08:35:10.708 --> 08:35:10.718 align:start position:0%
going to be the result that the renters
 
08:35:13.070 --> 08:35:13.080 align:start position:0%
of the adus Start parking on and
 
08:35:15.228 --> 08:35:15.238 align:start position:0%
clogging up the seats uh streets near
 
08:35:15.238 --> 08:35:17.070 align:start position:0%
clogging up the seats uh streets near
the

08:35:17.070 --> 08:35:17.080 align:start position:0%
the
 
08:35:19.110 --> 08:35:19.120 align:start position:0%
units you're going to have negative
 
08:35:20.868 --> 08:35:20.878 align:start position:0%
aesthetic and social effects on the
 
08:35:22.150 --> 08:35:22.160 align:start position:0%
neighborhoods there's no way to get
 
08:35:24.030 --> 08:35:24.040 align:start position:0%
around it let's say you bought in a
 
08:35:25.910 --> 08:35:25.920 align:start position:0%
neighborhood consisting of Sam family
 
08:35:28.590 --> 08:35:28.600 align:start position:0%
homes like my mom grew up in in the
 
08:35:30.228 --> 08:35:30.238 align:start position:0%
North End of
 
08:35:32.388 --> 08:35:32.398 align:start position:0%
Manchester when you buy a piece of
 
08:35:34.150 --> 08:35:34.160 align:start position:0%
property you have an expectation of the
 
08:35:37.670 --> 08:35:37.680 align:start position:0%
zoning when you buy and you expect that
 
08:35:40.708 --> 08:35:40.718 align:start position:0%
zoning to remain and not be negated by
 
08:35:40.718 --> 08:35:45.708 align:start position:0%
zoning to remain and not be negated by
the

08:35:45.708 --> 08:35:45.718 align:start position:0%
 
08:35:49.030 --> 08:35:49.040 align:start position:0%
state and with this you're going to have
 
08:35:51.788 --> 08:35:51.798 align:start position:0%
no input on it when the state mandates
 
08:35:51.798 --> 08:35:53.308 align:start position:0%
no input on it when the state mandates
it

08:35:53.308 --> 08:35:53.318 align:start position:0%
it
 
08:35:55.590 --> 08:35:55.600 align:start position:0%
down it's not the warrant article
 
08:35:58.830 --> 08:35:58.840 align:start position:0%
process so not going to have a vote in
 
08:35:58.840 --> 08:36:01.030 align:start position:0%
process so not going to have a vote in
that

08:36:01.030 --> 08:36:01.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
08:36:03.270 --> 08:36:03.280 align:start position:0%
process the previous speaker mentioned
 
08:36:06.030 --> 08:36:06.040 align:start position:0%
the demands on the Municipal Water and
 
08:36:06.040 --> 08:36:07.190 align:start position:0%
the demands on the Municipal Water and
Sewer

08:36:07.190 --> 08:36:07.200 align:start position:0%
Sewer
 
08:36:09.070 --> 08:36:09.080 align:start position:0%
infrastructure who's going to pay for
 
08:36:12.350 --> 08:36:12.360 align:start position:0%
that what about will the rapid increase
 
08:36:14.350 --> 08:36:14.360 align:start position:0%
in the newcomers require increased
 
08:36:17.150 --> 08:36:17.160 align:start position:0%
police EMT presence increased trash
 
08:36:19.628 --> 08:36:19.638 align:start position:0%
collection what is the increased cost to
 
08:36:22.190 --> 08:36:22.200 align:start position:0%
the taxpayers how many new school age
 
08:36:24.190 --> 08:36:24.200 align:start position:0%
kids will be enrolling who are living in
 
08:36:27.708 --> 08:36:27.718 align:start position:0%
the adus who have one or two one or two
 
08:36:30.510 --> 08:36:30.520 align:start position:0%
or more children living on the property
 
08:36:33.670 --> 08:36:33.680 align:start position:0%
does an extra ,000 collected in taxes
 
08:36:36.510 --> 08:36:36.520 align:start position:0%
cover the additional $20,000 per
 
08:36:40.190 --> 08:36:40.200 align:start position:0%
student no it doesn't so again I'll ask
 
08:36:43.150 --> 08:36:43.160 align:start position:0%
what will be the cost to the
 
08:36:45.030 --> 08:36:45.040 align:start position:0%
taxpayers now I'm going to go off a
 
08:36:49.430 --> 08:36:49.440 align:start position:0%
 
08:36:51.990 --> 08:36:52.000 align:start position:0%
process I want to talk about the special
 
08:36:53.670 --> 08:36:53.680 align:start position:0%
committee on
 
08:36:55.830 --> 08:36:55.840 align:start position:0%
housing that's a 10-minute member
 
08:36:55.840 --> 08:36:56.708 align:start position:0%
housing that's a 10-minute member
committee

08:36:56.708 --> 08:36:56.718 align:start position:0%
committee
 
08:36:59.308 --> 08:36:59.318 align:start position:0%
committee this bill before you right
 
08:37:02.468 --> 08:37:02.478 align:start position:0%
here nine of the 10 committee
 
08:37:05.788 --> 08:37:05.798 align:start position:0%
members were sponsors of this
 
08:37:09.788 --> 08:37:09.798 align:start position:0%
bill this committee heard this
 
08:37:12.228 --> 08:37:12.238 align:start position:0%
Bill had the
 
08:37:15.388 --> 08:37:15.398 align:start position:0%
hearing exect it and then sent it to the
 
08:37:19.510 --> 08:37:19.520 align:start position:0%
floor on a vote of 9 to one does anybody
 
08:37:23.548 --> 08:37:23.558 align:start position:0%
see anything a little off with that I
 
08:37:27.788 --> 08:37:27.798 align:start position:0%
sure do am will suspend yes
 
08:37:30.670 --> 08:37:30.680 align:start position:0%
motives are off limits the what motives
 
08:37:32.788 --> 08:37:32.798 align:start position:0%
are off
 
08:37:32.798 --> 08:37:36.948 align:start position:0%
are off
limits

08:37:36.948 --> 08:37:36.958 align:start position:0%
 
08:37:41.150 --> 08:37:41.160 align:start position:0%
okay these bills belong in Municipal and
 
08:37:43.510 --> 08:37:43.520 align:start position:0%
County government where the subject
 
08:37:45.590 --> 08:37:45.600 align:start position:0%
matter experts
 
08:37:50.388 --> 08:37:50.398 align:start position:0%
reside and I can tell you remember will
 
08:37:53.150 --> 08:37:53.160 align:start position:0%
suspend the speaker assigns the bills he
 
08:37:55.030 --> 08:37:55.040 align:start position:0%
put them where they were
 
08:37:55.040 --> 08:38:02.788 align:start position:0%
put them where they were
appropriate

08:38:02.788 --> 08:38:02.798 align:start position:0%
 
08:38:04.830 --> 08:38:04.840 align:start position:0%
correct all right we'll move on to the
 
08:38:09.228 --> 08:38:09.238 align:start position:0%
 
08:38:12.788 --> 08:38:12.798 align:start position:0%
that so again let's
 
08:38:15.708 --> 08:38:15.718 align:start position:0%
talk that these Adu structures would be
 
08:38:18.350 --> 08:38:18.360 align:start position:0%
a mandate and take away the local
 
08:38:21.150 --> 08:38:21.160 align:start position:0%
control don't be misled by the language
 
08:38:23.228 --> 08:38:23.238 align:start position:0%
the Sounder softing language that these
 
08:38:26.228 --> 08:38:26.238 align:start position:0%
bills a lot of these bills contain
 
08:38:29.510 --> 08:38:29.520 align:start position:0%
Allowed by a matter of right no to be
 
08:38:31.990 --> 08:38:32.000 align:start position:0%
clear this means your M municipalities
 
08:38:34.228 --> 08:38:34.238 align:start position:0%
must allow the two adus in this case
 
08:38:35.388 --> 08:38:35.398 align:start position:0%
it's not an
 
08:38:38.468 --> 08:38:38.478 align:start position:0%
option politicians in conquer do not
 
08:38:39.990 --> 08:38:40.000 align:start position:0%
understand and know the needs and wants
 
08:38:41.910 --> 08:38:41.920 align:start position:0%
of distant municipalities such as
 
08:38:44.868 --> 08:38:44.878 align:start position:0%
Pittsburgh or Hampton or Lebanon or NASA
 
08:38:47.590 --> 08:38:47.600 align:start position:0%
or my town of barington to believe we
 
08:38:50.708 --> 08:38:50.718 align:start position:0%
know better is simply wrong don't
 
08:38:53.150 --> 08:38:53.160 align:start position:0%
infringe on the municipality's
 
08:38:54.948 --> 08:38:54.958 align:start position:0%
role of
 
08:38:54.958 --> 08:38:56.948 align:start position:0%
role of
zoning

08:38:56.948 --> 08:38:56.958 align:start position:0%
zoning
 
08:38:59.910 --> 08:38:59.920 align:start position:0%
and I'm going to end with an
 
08:39:03.468 --> 08:39:03.478 align:start position:0%
axom that we used to say at the Allied
 
08:39:05.228 --> 08:39:05.238 align:start position:0%
Pilots Association where the member of
 
08:39:08.388 --> 08:39:08.398 align:start position:0%
Kingston used to also be a member while
 
08:39:10.110 --> 08:39:10.120 align:start position:0%
I was in leadership there as a member of
 
08:39:10.120 --> 08:39:10.910 align:start position:0%
I was in leadership there as a member of
a

08:39:10.910 --> 08:39:10.920 align:start position:0%
a
 
08:39:13.430 --> 08:39:13.440 align:start position:0%
15,000 uh pilot
 
08:39:15.788 --> 08:39:15.798 align:start position:0%
Union during my leadership roles
 
08:39:18.750 --> 08:39:18.760 align:start position:0%
whenever we were in contract negotiation
 
08:39:21.788 --> 08:39:21.798 align:start position:0%
times we used to have a
 
08:39:24.228 --> 08:39:24.238 align:start position:0%
saying and the saying was a good
 
08:39:27.030 --> 08:39:27.040 align:start position:0%
contract sells itself
 
08:39:30.868 --> 08:39:30.878 align:start position:0%
no sales job to the members is
 
08:39:33.750 --> 08:39:33.760 align:start position:0%
required that axium applies to
 
08:39:37.308 --> 08:39:37.318 align:start position:0%
legislation Al also I'll ask that you
 
08:39:41.308 --> 08:39:41.318 align:start position:0%
support the uh that you oppose the
 
08:39:44.670 --> 08:39:44.680 align:start position:0%
emotion uh the motion of ought to pass
 
08:39:47.350 --> 08:39:47.360 align:start position:0%
so another motion can be made thank you
 
08:39:47.360 --> 08:39:49.070 align:start position:0%

Mr

08:39:49.070 --> 08:39:49.080 align:start position:0%
Mr
 
08:39:51.270 --> 08:39:51.280 align:start position:0%
Speaker representative Alexander's
 
08:39:52.788 --> 08:39:52.798 align:start position:0%
recognized speak and support of the
 
08:39:52.798 --> 08:39:54.910 align:start position:0%
recognized speak and support of the
committee

08:39:54.910 --> 08:39:54.920 align:start position:0%
committee
 
08:39:57.750 --> 08:39:57.760 align:start position:0%
report thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker I
 
08:39:58.990 --> 08:39:59.000 align:start position:0%
want to to spell a bunch of the
 
08:40:01.308 --> 08:40:01.318 align:start position:0%
narratives that's being pushed off today
 
08:40:03.150 --> 08:40:03.160 align:start position:0%
um I but first I want to thank you for
 
08:40:04.750 --> 08:40:04.760 align:start position:0%
forming not you in particular but the
 
08:40:06.750 --> 08:40:06.760 align:start position:0%
speaker um behind you for forming the
 
08:40:08.510 --> 08:40:08.520 align:start position:0%
special committee on housing because out
 
08:40:10.030 --> 08:40:10.040 align:start position:0%
of these bills there's only two on the
 
08:40:12.308 --> 08:40:12.318 align:start position:0%
regular calendar five are on consent we
 
08:40:13.910 --> 08:40:13.920 align:start position:0%
got some really good stuff done
 
08:40:16.030 --> 08:40:16.040 align:start position:0%
regarding small targeted changes at the
 
08:40:19.628 --> 08:40:19.638 align:start position:0%
approval processes and unnecessary codes
 
08:40:21.270 --> 08:40:21.280 align:start position:0%
this bill came into place because of a
 
08:40:24.070 --> 08:40:24.080 align:start position:0%
law that was signed allowing Adu by
 
08:40:28.510 --> 08:40:28.520 align:start position:0%
right in SB 14 6 in 2016 since then
 
08:40:31.190 --> 08:40:31.200 align:start position:0%
municipalities have gone around this law
 
08:40:33.548 --> 08:40:33.558 align:start position:0%
by putting in arbitrary parking mandates
 
08:40:36.070 --> 08:40:36.080 align:start position:0%
setback requirements in order to
 
08:40:37.830 --> 08:40:37.840 align:start position:0%
restrict Property Owners from building
 
08:40:40.788 --> 08:40:40.798 align:start position:0%
adus on their own land now I believe
 
08:40:43.430 --> 08:40:43.440 align:start position:0%
unless there is a health or safety issue
 
08:40:45.510 --> 08:40:45.520 align:start position:0%
you should not have a right to tell
 
08:40:47.430 --> 08:40:47.440 align:start position:0%
someone what they can and cannot do with
 
08:40:49.190 --> 08:40:49.200 align:start position:0%
their own
 
08:40:51.788 --> 08:40:51.798 align:start position:0%
property this bill is a clarifying bill
 
08:40:53.510 --> 08:40:53.520 align:start position:0%
that makes it clear that municipalities
 
08:40:56.030 --> 08:40:56.040 align:start position:0%
cannot restrict an Adu by right by
 
08:40:57.590 --> 08:40:57.600 align:start position:0%
changing the definition of attached
 
08:41:00.308 --> 08:41:00.318 align:start position:0%
versus detached and allowing one Adu to
 
08:41:04.030 --> 08:41:04.040 align:start position:0%
be detached but the second one has to be
 
08:41:06.150 --> 08:41:06.160 align:start position:0%
attached it also makes it clear that a
 
08:41:07.750 --> 08:41:07.760 align:start position:0%
municipality cannot say You must have
 
08:41:10.110 --> 08:41:10.120 align:start position:0%
five or six parking spaces that seems a
 
08:41:12.110 --> 08:41:12.120 align:start position:0%
little ridiculous for an Adu that's th
 
08:41:15.150 --> 08:41:15.160 align:start position:0%
Square ft you need six parking spaces
 
08:41:17.350 --> 08:41:17.360 align:start position:0%
this is how municipalities zone out this
 
08:41:20.228 --> 08:41:20.238 align:start position:0%
types of building and it's wrong in my
 
08:41:22.990 --> 08:41:23.000 align:start position:0%
opinion but under HP 1291 local
 
08:41:24.670 --> 08:41:24.680 align:start position:0%
governments still have the ability to do
 
08:41:25.670 --> 08:41:25.680 align:start position:0%
all these things ready I'm going to
 
08:41:28.070 --> 08:41:28.080 align:start position:0%
listen list them off if they have the
 
08:41:29.468 --> 08:41:29.478 align:start position:0%
right to restrict it if it lacks
 
08:41:32.388 --> 08:41:32.398 align:start position:0%
sufficient space because the setback
 
08:41:34.308 --> 08:41:34.318 align:start position:0%
requirements a private well a wet land
 
08:41:37.190 --> 08:41:37.200 align:start position:0%
or the property line are not adequate if
 
08:41:39.070 --> 08:41:39.080 align:start position:0%
it lacks sufficient land to construct an
 
08:41:41.510 --> 08:41:41.520 align:start position:0%
adequate SEPTA system they can deny it
 
08:41:43.788 --> 08:41:43.798 align:start position:0%
based on science based on health based
 
08:41:47.628 --> 08:41:47.638 align:start position:0%
on safety if it lacks drinkable water
 
08:41:51.308 --> 08:41:51.318 align:start position:0%
you can deny it if it lacks adequate
 
08:41:54.308 --> 08:41:54.318 align:start position:0%
parking if it lacks adequate fire
 
08:41:57.228 --> 08:41:57.238 align:start position:0%
protection min alties may also require
 
08:42:00.430 --> 08:42:00.440 align:start position:0%
that the owner occupies one of the units
 
08:42:02.948 --> 08:42:02.958 align:start position:0%
that means that they're I don't know
 
08:42:04.708 --> 08:42:04.718 align:start position:0%
like people know the people that are
 
08:42:05.948 --> 08:42:05.958 align:start position:0%
living in that
 
08:42:08.708 --> 08:42:08.718 align:start position:0%
property this bill is the gentlest way
 
08:42:11.150 --> 08:42:11.160 align:start position:0%
possible to increase the housing supply
 
08:42:13.430 --> 08:42:13.440 align:start position:0%
for this state New Hampshire voters have
 
08:42:15.670 --> 08:42:15.680 align:start position:0%
indicated that housing availability is
 
08:42:17.468 --> 08:42:17.478 align:start position:0%
the number one issue affecting them we

market no one is moving let's give
 
08:42:30.110 --> 08:42:30.120 align:start position:0%

08:49:46.308 --> 08:49:46.318 align:start position:0%
report thank you Mr Speaker again I rise
 
08:49:49.670 --> 08:49:49.680 align:start position:0%
in opposition to House Bill
 
08:49:53.070 --> 08:49:53.080 align:start position:0%
1399 this bill requires that on all lots
 
08:49:56.228 --> 08:49:56.238 align:start position:0%
of two acres or less and at least 50% of
 
08:49:58.910 --> 08:49:58.920 align:start position:0%
single family Zone Lots duplexes shall
 
08:50:02.388 --> 08:50:02.398 align:start position:0%
be allowed Again by right based on the
 
08:50:05.430 --> 08:50:05.440 align:start position:0%
section of the proposed RSA a two-unit
 
08:50:07.708 --> 08:50:07.718 align:start position:0%
residence would be permitted on property
 
08:50:11.430 --> 08:50:11.440 align:start position:0%
zoned industrial commercial agricultural
 
08:50:13.990 --> 08:50:14.000 align:start position:0%
historic district any property of 2
 
08:50:17.548 --> 08:50:17.558 align:start position:0%
Acres or less and the municipality must
 
08:50:21.350 --> 08:50:21.360 align:start position:0%
 
08:50:23.670 --> 08:50:23.680 align:start position:0%
denied this bill has an interesting
 
08:50:25.750 --> 08:50:25.760 align:start position:0%
Clause exception that deals with water
 
08:50:25.760 --> 08:50:26.548 align:start position:0%
Clause exception that deals with water
and

08:50:26.548 --> 08:50:26.558 align:start position:0%
and
 
08:50:29.468 --> 08:50:29.478 align:start position:0%
sewer we know that adding up to the
 
08:50:29.478 --> 08:50:30.430 align:start position:0%
sewer we know that adding up to the
additional

08:50:30.430 --> 08:50:30.440 align:start position:0%
additional
 
08:50:33.590 --> 08:50:33.600 align:start position:0%
50% up to an additional 50% of
 
08:50:35.788 --> 08:50:35.798 align:start position:0%
residential units in a city will
 
08:50:37.750 --> 08:50:37.760 align:start position:0%
definitely increase the demands on the
 
08:50:40.388 --> 08:50:40.398 align:start position:0%
water and sewer line this bill states
 
08:50:42.788 --> 08:50:42.798 align:start position:0%
you have 10 years to upgrade your water
 
08:50:45.070 --> 08:50:45.080 align:start position:0%
system and if you don't well we can
 
08:50:48.510 --> 08:50:48.520 align:start position:0%
build it Anyway by right I think we all
 
08:50:50.948 --> 08:50:50.958 align:start position:0%
agree that the state compelling zoning
 
08:50:53.350 --> 08:50:53.360 align:start position:0%
changes and forcing a city to redo their
 
08:50:55.670 --> 08:50:55.680 align:start position:0%
water and seore without providing
 
08:50:59.070 --> 08:50:59.080 align:start position:0%
funding is therefore an unfunded
 
08:51:01.708 --> 08:51:01.718 align:start position:0%
mandate the municipali planners are
 
08:51:03.228 --> 08:51:03.238 align:start position:0%
going to have to develop some ex
 
08:51:06.308 --> 08:51:06.318 align:start position:0%
extraordinary powers of ESP on this one
 
08:51:08.868 --> 08:51:08.878 align:start position:0%
as it would require the municipality to
 
08:51:12.388 --> 08:51:12.398 align:start position:0%
be able to predict all future proposed
 
08:51:14.830 --> 08:51:14.840 align:start position:0%
development once it does that then it
 
08:51:17.150 --> 08:51:17.160 align:start position:0%
has to determine what proposed
 
08:51:20.628 --> 08:51:20.638 align:start position:0%
development meets to Al uh to alteration
 
08:51:24.430 --> 08:51:24.440 align:start position:0%
or demolition criteria and then attempt
 
08:51:26.430 --> 08:51:26.440 align:start position:0%
to predict and allocate between the two
 
08:51:29.270 --> 08:51:29.280 align:start position:0%
acres or less slots and 50% of
 
08:51:31.548 --> 08:51:31.558 align:start position:0%
residential lots confused
 
08:51:33.910 --> 08:51:33.920 align:start position:0%
yet I've gone over this thing multiple
 
08:51:36.270 --> 08:51:36.280 align:start position:0%
multiple times and I still am confused
 
08:51:38.868 --> 08:51:38.878 align:start position:0%
by this one just imagine being one of
 
08:51:41.548 --> 08:51:41.558 align:start position:0%
the planning uh or the individuals in
 
08:51:43.670 --> 08:51:43.680 align:start position:0%
your town who has to figure this one out
 
08:51:47.430 --> 08:51:47.440 align:start position:0%
and implement it once the municipality
 
08:51:49.350 --> 08:51:49.360 align:start position:0%
calculates how many of the two acres or
 
08:51:51.030 --> 08:51:51.040 align:start position:0%
less qualified then it must divide out
 
08:51:53.190 --> 08:51:53.200 align:start position:0%
those zone for single family homes and
 
08:52:55.350 --> 08:52:55.360 align:start position:0%
 
08:52:57.270 --> 08:52:57.280 align:start position:0%
the state should not be forcing mandates
 
08:53:00.030 --> 08:53:00.040 align:start position:0%
onto towns and cities takeing away the
 
08:53:01.670 --> 08:53:01.680 align:start position:0%
property rights of the municipalities
 
08:53:01.680 --> 08:53:05.830 align:start position:0%
property rights of the municipalities
current

08:53:05.830 --> 08:53:05.840 align:start position:0%
 
08:53:08.670 --> 08:53:08.680 align:start position:0%
residents is there even a remote
 
08:53:10.750 --> 08:53:10.760 align:start position:0%
possibility that the
 
08:53:13.430 --> 08:53:13.440 align:start position:0%
M scenario where the municipality is
 
08:53:14.750 --> 08:53:14.760 align:start position:0%
going to be able to figure out even how
 
08:53:17.350 --> 08:53:17.360 align:start position:0%
to comply with this legislation the
 
08:53:19.308 --> 08:53:19.318 align:start position:0%
legislation has been poorly drafted and
 
08:53:20.430 --> 08:53:20.440 align:start position:0%
it is
 
08:53:22.910 --> 08:53:22.920 align:start position:0%
inadequate uh has inadequately been
 
08:53:26.670 --> 08:53:26.680 align:start position:0%
analyzed for its practical application
 
08:53:29.150 --> 08:53:29.160 align:start position:0%
I'll say once again that local control
 
08:53:31.788 --> 08:53:31.798 align:start position:0%
of zoning is a long-standing practice
 
08:53:33.548 --> 08:53:33.558 align:start position:0%
that gives the municipalities and its
 
08:53:35.910 --> 08:53:35.920 align:start position:0%
citizens the ability to change zoning if
 
08:53:35.920 --> 08:53:36.628 align:start position:0%
citizens the ability to change zoning if
they

08:53:36.628 --> 08:53:36.638 align:start position:0%
they
 
08:53:40.190 --> 08:53:40.200 align:start position:0%
determine by Warren article top- down
 
08:53:42.510 --> 08:53:42.520 align:start position:0%
zoning changes by the state couched as
 
08:53:44.030 --> 08:53:44.040 align:start position:0%
getting back property rights is
 
08:53:46.628 --> 08:53:46.638 align:start position:0%
misleading you do not force many people
 
08:53:48.548 --> 08:53:48.558 align:start position:0%
to accept the will of a few politicians
 
08:53:51.430 --> 08:53:51.440 align:start position:0%
or bureaucrats that is Central planning
 
08:53:54.670 --> 08:53:54.680 align:start position:0%
at its worst I ask you to oppose the
 
08:53:57.590 --> 08:53:57.600 align:start position:0%
motion of otpa so another o u motion can
 
08:53:59.228 --> 08:53:59.238 align:start position:0%
be made thank you Mr Speaker does a
 
08:54:02.190 --> 08:54:02.200 align:start position:0%
 
08:54:04.788 --> 08:54:04.798 align:start position:0%
question why
 
08:54:08.070 --> 08:54:08.080 align:start position:0%
not representative com May inquire thank
 
08:54:09.670 --> 08:54:09.680 align:start position:0%
you Mr Speaker and thank you for taking
 
08:54:13.548 --> 08:54:13.558 align:start position:0%
my question um I live in a town where we
 
08:54:17.510 --> 08:54:17.520 align:start position:0%
have a 2 acre minimum lot size um and we
 
08:54:19.388 --> 08:54:19.398 align:start position:0%
also have controlled growth how will
 
08:54:21.910 --> 08:54:21.920 align:start position:0%
this affect us I missed the last part
 
08:55:25.308 --> 08:55:25.318 align:start position:0%
 
08:55:27.070 --> 08:55:27.080 align:start position:0%
by enabling homeowners to expand
 
08:55:29.110 --> 08:55:29.120 align:start position:0%
existing single family homes into
 
08:55:32.670 --> 08:55:32.680 align:start position:0%
duplexes or build new duplex homes on
 
08:55:34.388 --> 08:55:34.398 align:start position:0%
smaller Lots in single family
 
08:55:36.910 --> 08:55:36.920 align:start position:0%
residential zones this increases housing
 
08:55:38.628 --> 08:55:38.638 align:start position:0%
options and provides more units to
 
08:55:40.868 --> 08:55:40.878 align:start position:0%
address New Hampshire's housing shortage
 
08:55:43.308 --> 08:55:43.318 align:start position:0%
crisis this bill allows duplexes to be
 
08:55:44.990 --> 08:55:45.000 align:start position:0%
built in 50% of single family
 
08:55:47.150 --> 08:55:47.160 align:start position:0%
residential zones and lots of two acres
 
08:55:50.548 --> 08:55:50.558 align:start position:0%
or less in size by right provided that
 
08:55:53.430 --> 08:55:53.440 align:start position:0%
new duplex does meet certain criteria
 
08:55:55.750 --> 08:55:55.760 align:start position:0%
duplexes are light density and from the
 
08:55:58.030 --> 08:55:58.040 align:start position:0%
street they are often the same size and
 
08:56:00.788 --> 08:56:00.798 align:start position:0%
appearance as a single family house you
 
08:56:03.070 --> 08:56:03.080 align:start position:0%
can't even tell it's a
 
08:56:05.590 --> 08:56:05.600 align:start position:0%
duplex we can no longer wait for local
 
08:56:07.430 --> 08:56:07.440 align:start position:0%
control to fix the problem of overly
 
08:56:09.190 --> 08:56:09.200 align:start position:0%
restrictive local zoning
 
08:56:12.070 --> 08:56:12.080 align:start position:0%
ordinances down zoning when a parcel of
 
08:56:14.270 --> 08:56:14.280 align:start position:0%
land is rezoned from a prior more
 
08:56:16.308 --> 08:56:16.318 align:start position:0%
intense use to more restricted use is
 
08:56:18.070 --> 08:56:18.080 align:start position:0%
what we're dealing with right here right
 
08:56:20.548 --> 08:56:20.558 align:start position:0%
now local control will not fix the
 
08:56:22.350 --> 08:56:22.360 align:start position:0%
problem of historical down zoning which
 
08:56:24.228 --> 08:56:24.238 align:start position:0%
is why this bill is needed to restore
 
08:56:27.190 --> 08:56:27.200 align:start position:0%
duplexes are missing middle housing
 
08:56:29.750 --> 08:56:29.760 align:start position:0%
duplexes do not devalue property and
 
08:56:32.510 --> 08:56:32.520 align:start position:0%
impacted zones duplexes do not force
 
08:56:34.270 --> 08:56:34.280 align:start position:0%
municipalities to increase sewer and
 
08:56:36.590 --> 08:56:36.600 align:start position:0%
water capacity in fact we have two
 
08:56:38.590 --> 08:56:38.600 align:start position:0%
special Clauses in the bill to address
 
08:56:40.948 --> 08:56:40.958 align:start position:0%
concerns about sewer and water issues
 
08:56:42.708 --> 08:56:42.718 align:start position:0%
and finally there's the concern that if
 
08:56:45.190 --> 08:56:45.200 align:start position:0%
there's a public health and safety issue
 
08:56:47.830 --> 08:56:47.840 align:start position:0%
you may ask the state for a finding to
 
08:56:49.788 --> 08:56:49.798 align:start position:0%
find your way around not allowing
 
08:56:53.708 --> 08:56:53.718 align:start position:0%
duplexes so there is an out finally in
 
08:56:55.308 --> 08:56:55.318 align:start position:0%
terms of impact on local local planning
 
08:56:57.750 --> 08:56:57.760 align:start position:0%
boards local planning boards can still
 
08:57:00.270 --> 08:57:00.280 align:start position:0%
impose objective zoning limitations even
 
08:57:02.150 --> 08:57:02.160 align:start position:0%
with this bill height limitations
 
08:57:04.430 --> 08:57:04.440 align:start position:0%
building setbacks allowable lot coverage
 
08:57:06.510 --> 08:57:06.520 align:start position:0%
and of course our historic and other
 
08:57:09.990 --> 08:57:10.000 align:start position:0%
overlay districts still apply so in
 
08:57:11.708 --> 08:57:11.718 align:start position:0%
conclusion I ask you to please support
 
08:57:13.308 --> 08:57:13.318 align:start position:0%
this bill so that we can bring back
 
08:57:15.388 --> 08:57:15.398 align:start position:0%
missing middle housing that we had 50
 
08:57:17.628 --> 08:57:17.638 align:start position:0%
years ago until it was down zoned by our
 
08:57:23.190 --> 08:57:23.200 align:start position:0%
 
08:57:26.070 --> 08:57:26.080 align:start position:0%

08:57:37.388 --> 08:57:37.398 align:start position:0%
it'll be a roll call

report about to pass as amended on House

representative Walsh is recognized for a

08:58:43.788 --> 08:58:43.798 align:start position:0%
inquiry thank you Mr Speaker uh Mr
 
08:58:46.030 --> 08:58:46.040 align:start position:0%
Speaker if I know this is another top-
 
08:58:49.228 --> 08:58:49.238 align:start position:0%
down zoning change mandated by the state
 
08:58:53.150 --> 08:58:53.160 align:start position:0%
uh and and if I know I this one's a
 
08:58:54.388 --> 08:58:54.398 align:start position:0%
little different because I really don't
 
08:58:56.228 --> 08:58:56.238 align:start position:0%
have a problem with
 
08:58:58.990 --> 08:58:59.000 align:start position:0%
duplexes uh but Mr Speaker if I know the
 
08:59:01.830 --> 08:59:01.840 align:start position:0%
problem is with how the bill is written
 
08:59:04.030 --> 08:59:04.040 align:start position:0%
uh demolition requirements and
 
08:59:06.510 --> 08:59:06.520 align:start position:0%
percentages percentages of lots and
 
08:59:09.228 --> 08:59:09.238 align:start position:0%
residential lots versus residential lots
 
08:59:11.388 --> 08:59:11.398 align:start position:0%
the need to estimate future growth to
 
08:59:13.910 --> 08:59:13.920 align:start position:0%
maintain the 50% that's required with
 
08:59:15.990 --> 08:59:16.000 align:start position:0%
the very real chance of spot zoning
 
08:59:18.270 --> 08:59:18.280 align:start position:0%
which as you heard is
 
08:59:20.910 --> 08:59:20.920 align:start position:0%
illegal uh if I also know Mr Speaker
 
08:59:22.388 --> 08:59:22.398 align:start position:0%
that I don't want you to take my word
 
08:59:24.830 --> 08:59:24.840 align:start position:0%
for it uh but an attorney from the
 
08:59:27.190 --> 08:59:27.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Municipal Association sent out
 
08:59:30.590 --> 08:59:30.600 align:start position:0%
uh a communication stating quote due to
 
08:59:33.270 --> 08:59:33.280 align:start position:0%
the complexity of mathematics here I
 
08:59:36.270 --> 08:59:36.280 align:start position:0%
simply do not see any scenario where any
 
08:59:38.150 --> 08:59:38.160 align:start position:0%
municipality in the state would be able
 
08:59:41.670 --> 08:59:41.680 align:start position:0%
to comply with this legislation
 
08:59:44.910 --> 08:59:44.920 align:start position:0%
unquote Mr Speaker finally if I know
 
08:59:47.548 --> 08:59:47.558 align:start position:0%
this is a mandate that doesn't work and
 
08:59:50.228 --> 08:59:50.238 align:start position:0%
we should do better to pass laws would I
 
08:59:52.590 --> 08:59:52.600 align:start position:0%
then press the red
 
08:59:55.070 --> 08:59:55.080 align:start position:0%
button representative Damon recogniz for
 
08:59:55.080 --> 08:59:59.070 align:start position:0%

08:59:59.070 --> 08:59:59.080 align:start position:0%
 
09:00:01.270 --> 09:00:01.280 align:start position:0%
inquiry thank you Mr
 
09:00:04.150 --> 09:00:04.160 align:start position:0%
Speaker if I know that duplexes are
 
09:00:06.910 --> 09:00:06.920 align:start position:0%
coste effective missing middle housing
 
09:00:08.628 --> 09:00:08.638 align:start position:0%
but they've been difficult to build due
 
09:00:11.228 --> 09:00:11.238 align:start position:0%
to local zoning restrictions and if I
 
09:00:13.270 --> 09:00:13.280 align:start position:0%
know this bill includes solid
 
09:00:15.948 --> 09:00:15.958 align:start position:0%
protections for municipalities to apply
 
09:00:17.990 --> 09:00:18.000 align:start position:0%
objective standards as well as
 
09:00:19.868 --> 09:00:19.878 align:start position:0%
permitting an exemption if there is
 
09:00:22.830 --> 09:00:22.840 align:start position:0%
specific adverse effect upon public
 
09:00:25.430 --> 09:00:25.440 align:start position:0%
health and safety and if if I know
 
09:00:27.750 --> 09:00:27.760 align:start position:0%
increasing our housing availability is
 
09:00:30.350 --> 09:00:30.360 align:start position:0%
critical to maintaining a sufficient
 
09:00:33.350 --> 09:00:33.360 align:start position:0%
Workforce in New Hampshire and that this
 
09:00:35.670 --> 09:00:35.680 align:start position:0%
bill passed our bike partisan committee
 
09:00:38.750 --> 09:00:38.760 align:start position:0%

that's in your seat pocket relative to
 
09:18:53.160 --> 09:18:54.150 align:start position:0%
that's in your seat pocket relative to

09:18:54.150 --> 09:18:54.160 align:start position:0%
this
 
09:18:56.428 --> 09:18:56.438 align:start position:0%
Bill takes the bill that we have and
 
09:18:58.868 --> 09:18:58.878 align:start position:0%
turns it into a study committee it does
 
09:19:01.748 --> 09:19:01.758 align:start position:0%
 
09:19:03.868 --> 09:19:03.878 align:start position:0%
reasons the amendment that was just
 
09:19:07.030 --> 09:19:07.040 align:start position:0%
adopted by this
 
09:19:10.630 --> 09:19:10.640 align:start position:0%
body includes involuntary admissions
 
09:19:13.150 --> 09:19:13.160 align:start position:0%
what does that mean let's say you have a
 
09:19:13.160 --> 09:19:14.550 align:start position:0%
what does that mean let's say you have a
child

09:19:14.550 --> 09:19:14.560 align:start position:0%
child
 
09:19:17.790 --> 09:19:17.800 align:start position:0%
who came down with a serious issue a
 
09:19:19.830 --> 09:19:19.840 align:start position:0%
medical issue of some sort I'm going to
 
09:19:22.510 --> 09:19:22.520 align:start position:0%
use anorexia because that's clearly a a
 
09:19:25.310 --> 09:19:25.320 align:start position:0%
potential for self harm right or harm
 
09:19:28.870 --> 09:19:28.880 align:start position:0%
harm to the person in a significant
 
09:19:31.310 --> 09:19:31.320 align:start position:0%
way you could have a Court rule that
 
09:19:32.830 --> 09:19:32.840 align:start position:0%
that person needs to go to the hospital
 
09:19:35.790 --> 09:19:35.800 align:start position:0%
and stay there until they're in a better
 
09:19:38.990 --> 09:19:39.000 align:start position:0%
position is that person a criminal is
 
09:19:41.870 --> 09:19:41.880 align:start position:0%
that person dangerous to themselves well
 
09:19:43.746 --> 09:19:43.756 align:start position:0%
they have an eating disorder but I'm not
 
09:19:47.230 --> 09:19:47.240 align:start position:0%
 
09:19:49.790 --> 09:19:49.800 align:start position:0%
themselves when we draft legislation we
 
09:19:51.510 --> 09:19:51.520 align:start position:0%
should be really
 
09:19:54.510 --> 09:19:54.520 align:start position:0%
clear about the terms
 
09:19:56.426 --> 09:19:56.436 align:start position:0%
this uses the same broad language that's
 
09:19:58.150 --> 09:19:58.160 align:start position:0%
in current federal
 
09:20:01.070 --> 09:20:01.080 align:start position:0%
statutes and that broad language doesn't
 
09:20:02.990 --> 09:20:03.000 align:start position:0%
necessarily apply to all the cases in
 
09:20:03.000 --> 09:20:05.746 align:start position:0%
necessarily apply to all the cases in
New

09:20:05.746 --> 09:20:05.756 align:start position:0%
 
09:20:07.746 --> 09:20:07.756 align:start position:0%
Hampshire people that struggle with
 
09:20:09.426 --> 09:20:09.436 align:start position:0%
mental health issues shouldn't be
 
09:20:11.230 --> 09:20:11.240 align:start position:0%
treated as criminals should not be put
 
09:20:13.870 --> 09:20:13.880 align:start position:0%
on a criminal database people that have
 
09:20:16.670 --> 09:20:16.680 align:start position:0%
mental health issues should in fact get
 
09:20:18.790 --> 09:20:18.800 align:start position:0%
the care that they
 
09:20:22.510 --> 09:20:22.520 align:start position:0%
need by forcing this bill through even
 
09:20:25.110 --> 09:20:25.120 align:start position:0%
with the committee Amendment what we're
 
09:20:27.906 --> 09:20:27.916 align:start position:0%
saying is if you have a mental health
 
09:20:30.350 --> 09:20:30.360 align:start position:0%
issue you're a
 
09:20:32.710 --> 09:20:32.720 align:start position:0%
criminal on the other side and I
 
09:20:34.630 --> 09:20:34.640 align:start position:0%
disbelieve that completely on the other
 
09:20:37.030 --> 09:20:37.040 align:start position:0%
side we're saying that if you take away
 
09:20:39.870 --> 09:20:39.880 align:start position:0%
their firearms even when a courtroom has
 
09:20:41.230 --> 09:20:41.240 align:start position:0%
or court has deemed that they're
 
09:20:44.310 --> 09:20:44.320 align:start position:0%
dangerous they're suddenly magically
 
09:20:47.266 --> 09:20:47.276 align:start position:0%
safe do we really believe
 
09:20:50.630 --> 09:20:50.640 align:start position:0%
that I remember a number of years ago
 
09:20:55.030 --> 09:20:55.040 align:start position:0%
where Timothy McVey used diesel Fuel and
 
09:20:59.670 --> 09:20:59.680 align:start position:0%
fertilizer to end the lives of over 150
 
09:21:02.746 --> 09:21:02.756 align:start position:0%
people I would call
 
09:21:06.630 --> 09:21:06.640 align:start position:0%
him um a danger to others whether he had
 
09:21:08.790 --> 09:21:08.800 align:start position:0%
a prior mental health record is is not
 
09:21:10.426 --> 09:21:10.436 align:start position:0%
the point I'm arguing the point I'm
 
09:21:12.906 --> 09:21:12.916 align:start position:0%
arguing right now is he was clearly a
 
09:21:15.310 --> 09:21:15.320 align:start position:0%
threat to others and needed
 
09:21:18.350 --> 09:21:18.360 align:start position:0%
help and unfortunately he he demolished
 
09:21:18.360 --> 09:21:21.470 align:start position:0%
help and unfortunately he he demolished
the

09:21:21.470 --> 09:21:21.480 align:start position:0%
 
09:21:23.950 --> 09:21:23.960 align:start position:0%
building we have a chance to study this
 
09:21:26.510 --> 09:21:26.520 align:start position:0%
issue right now to address the issues
 
09:21:28.550 --> 09:21:28.560 align:start position:0%
and the concerns raised by everybody
 
09:21:30.550 --> 09:21:30.560 align:start position:0%
from the disability rights
 
09:21:32.586 --> 09:21:32.596 align:start position:0%
groups all the way over to the gun
 
09:21:35.190 --> 09:21:35.200 align:start position:0%
groups this is the time to do that I
 
09:21:36.670 --> 09:21:36.680 align:start position:0%
would ask that you would adopt the floor
 
09:21:36.680 --> 09:21:37.790 align:start position:0%
would ask that you would adopt the floor

Speaker

Speaker
 
09:21:56.906 --> 09:21:56.916 align:start position:0%
don't fall for straw man arguments this
 
09:21:59.350 --> 09:21:59.360 align:start position:0%
has nothing to do with eating disorders
 
09:22:04.350 --> 09:22:04.360 align:start position:0%
or manure bombs this has got to do with
 
09:22:06.630 --> 09:22:06.640 align:start position:0%
whether or not someone is dangerous to
 
09:22:08.426 --> 09:22:08.436 align:start position:0%
themselves or others and has had two
 
09:22:10.630 --> 09:22:10.640 align:start position:0%
hearings in court has had a lawyer
 
09:22:12.586 --> 09:22:12.596 align:start position:0%
assigned to them and even after that oh
 
09:22:14.710 --> 09:22:14.720 align:start position:0%
and excuse me has also been committed
 
09:22:16.870 --> 09:22:16.880 align:start position:0%
prior to that for 10 days for
 
09:22:19.110 --> 09:22:19.120 align:start position:0%
observation even after all that the
 
09:22:21.790 --> 09:22:21.800 align:start position:0%
court has said you are likely a danger
 
09:22:24.510 --> 09:22:24.520 align:start position:0%
to yourselves or others
 
09:22:26.230 --> 09:22:26.240 align:start position:0%
if someone can find me someone who's had
 
09:22:28.710 --> 09:22:28.720 align:start position:0%
their weapons taken for anorexia I will
 
09:22:31.110 --> 09:22:31.120 align:start position:0%
give you my next year's salary from
 
09:22:33.550 --> 09:22:33.560 align:start position:0%
here I don't anticipate I'll be doing
 
09:22:36.510 --> 09:22:36.520 align:start position:0%
that so let's be serious this is a
 
09:22:40.110 --> 09:22:40.120 align:start position:0%
serious issue we don't need to study it
 
09:22:41.830 --> 09:22:41.840 align:start position:0%
we've been fighting back and forth about
 
09:22:44.150 --> 09:22:44.160 align:start position:0%
this now for over 10 years and in that
 
09:22:47.070 --> 09:22:47.080 align:start position:0%
time while we keep doing these little
 
09:22:48.990 --> 09:22:49.000 align:start position:0%
these little Maneuvers three police
 
09:22:50.470 --> 09:22:50.480 align:start position:0%
officers have been shot by people who
 
09:22:52.510 --> 09:22:52.520 align:start position:0%
should have been committed and who were
 
09:22:54.110 --> 09:22:54.120 align:start position:0%
committed and should have been on that
 
09:22:57.510 --> 09:22:57.520 align:start position:0%
list and one of them's dead so I ask you
 
09:22:59.950 --> 09:22:59.960 align:start position:0%
to not support this uh amendment to
 
09:23:01.830 --> 09:23:01.840 align:start position:0%
study let's get on with it get to the
 
09:23:04.550 --> 09:23:04.560 align:start position:0%

further Amendment representative H

09:23:44.710 --> 09:23:44.720 align:start position:0%
H thank you Mr Speaker this is the more
 
09:23:47.266 --> 09:23:47.276 align:start position:0%
complex Amendment and and although it's
 
09:23:49.830 --> 09:23:49.840 align:start position:0%
two pages front and or whatever one page
 
09:23:54.510 --> 09:23:54.520 align:start position:0%
front and back it is exactly what was
 
09:23:56.790 --> 09:23:56.800 align:start position:0%
adopted in the amendment from the
 
09:23:59.586 --> 09:23:59.596 align:start position:0%
committee with two small
 
09:24:01.906 --> 09:24:01.916 align:start position:0%
changes the first changes in the first
 
09:24:03.870 --> 09:24:03.880 align:start position:0%
couple of paragraphs relative to whether
 
09:24:06.426 --> 09:24:06.436 align:start position:0%
you're a harm to others or just a harm
 
09:24:08.470 --> 09:24:08.480 align:start position:0%
to yourself sorry a harm to yourself or
 
09:24:10.150 --> 09:24:10.160 align:start position:0%
harm to yourself and
 
09:24:13.230 --> 09:24:13.240 align:start position:0%
others this carves out those that are
 
09:24:15.150 --> 09:24:15.160 align:start position:0%
potentially a harm to themselves and
 
09:24:17.990 --> 09:24:18.000 align:start position:0%
says those names shouldn't be going into
 
09:24:20.070 --> 09:24:20.080 align:start position:0%
Nicks this was the issue I brought up
 
09:24:23.150 --> 09:24:23.160 align:start position:0%
earlier those people right are in
 
09:24:24.586 --> 09:24:24.596 align:start position:0%
different category than those that were
 
09:24:28.550 --> 09:24:28.560 align:start position:0%
ruled or adjudicated as not Reason Not
 
09:24:29.950 --> 09:24:29.960 align:start position:0%
competent to stand

ruled where there are danger to
 
09:24:41.030 --> 09:24:41.040 align:start position:0%
others the other part of this
 
09:24:43.550 --> 09:24:43.560 align:start position:0%
amendment is on the is on the back
 
09:24:47.070 --> 09:24:47.080 align:start position:0%
relative to what to do about the fact
 
09:24:49.110 --> 09:24:49.120 align:start position:0%
that officer
 
09:24:51.670 --> 09:24:51.680 align:start position:0%
hos was standing guard at a metal
 
09:24:53.990 --> 09:24:54.000 align:start position:0%
detector he was the perimeter of
 
09:24:56.350 --> 09:24:56.360 align:start position:0%
security for the state
 
09:24:59.586 --> 09:24:59.596 align:start position:0%
hospital he was a former police
 
09:25:02.350 --> 09:25:02.360 align:start position:0%
chief and all the police officers I know
 
09:25:05.230 --> 09:25:05.240 align:start position:0%
carry personally on their own time so
 
09:25:07.746 --> 09:25:07.756 align:start position:0%
why was the person Manning the security
 
09:25:10.906 --> 09:25:10.916 align:start position:0%
booth Manning the metal
 
09:25:13.630 --> 09:25:13.640 align:start position:0%
detector not carrying a personal firearm
 
09:25:16.150 --> 09:25:16.160 align:start position:0%
that day when he probably would have
 
09:25:18.870 --> 09:25:18.880 align:start position:0%
been for his personal protection outside
 
09:25:20.470 --> 09:25:20.480 align:start position:0%
of his job that
 
09:25:23.150 --> 09:25:23.160 align:start position:0%
day that family deserves to know the
 
09:25:24.906 --> 09:25:24.916 align:start position:0%
answers to that question and it's time
 
09:25:26.426 --> 09:25:26.436 align:start position:0%
to form the study committee to figure
 
09:25:28.710 --> 09:25:28.720 align:start position:0%
out why he was disarmed when he was
 
09:25:30.110 --> 09:25:30.120 align:start position:0%
acting as the
 
09:25:32.510 --> 09:25:32.520 align:start position:0%
security officer hos was still alive
 
09:25:35.230 --> 09:25:35.240 align:start position:0%
when he got to the hospital that day and
 
09:25:38.150 --> 09:25:38.160 align:start position:0%
while the psychiatric hospital is kind
 
09:25:39.790 --> 09:25:39.800 align:start position:0%
of diagonally across the street from
 
09:25:42.790 --> 09:25:42.800 align:start position:0%
conquered Hospital they're relatively
 
09:25:45.230 --> 09:25:45.240 align:start position:0%
close it's it's
 
09:25:49.110 --> 09:25:49.120 align:start position:0%
not it's not just a 30- second jaunt
 
09:25:51.110 --> 09:25:51.120 align:start position:0%
between the two it takes a little bit of
 
09:25:54.550 --> 09:25:54.560 align:start position:0%
time to get between those two buildings
 
09:25:56.990 --> 09:25:57.000 align:start position:0%
I would argue that his family deserves
 
09:25:59.390 --> 09:25:59.400 align:start position:0%
to know the answers so this amendment
 
09:26:01.670 --> 09:26:01.680 align:start position:0%
carves out the simply carves out those
 
09:26:04.426 --> 09:26:04.436 align:start position:0%
who might be a danger to
 
09:26:07.190 --> 09:26:07.200 align:start position:0%
themselves and creates a study committee
 
09:26:08.830 --> 09:26:08.840 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker I would ask for a roll call
 
09:26:11.710 --> 09:26:11.720 align:start position:0%
vote on the adoption of this
 
09:26:21.906 --> 09:26:21.916 align:start position:0%
 
09:26:21.916 --> 09:26:24.746 align:start position:0%

Roy
 
09:26:26.310 --> 09:26:26.320 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker I would
 
09:26:27.426 --> 09:26:27.436 align:start position:0%
ask everyone take a look at that
 
09:26:28.950 --> 09:26:28.960 align:start position:0%
Amendment take a look at the end of that
 
09:26:31.990 --> 09:26:32.000 align:start position:0%
Amendment it says we want to know we
 
09:26:33.670 --> 09:26:33.680 align:start position:0%
want a study committee to study whether
 
09:26:35.510 --> 09:26:35.520 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire is complicit
 
09:26:37.830 --> 09:26:37.840 align:start position:0%
in the murder of Chief H think about
 
09:26:38.990 --> 09:26:39.000 align:start position:0%
that that's what the amendment he's
 
09:26:41.426 --> 09:26:41.436 align:start position:0%
asking you to vote on to study was it
 
09:26:43.030 --> 09:26:43.040 align:start position:0%
was the state of New Hampshire complicit
 
09:26:45.070 --> 09:26:45.080 align:start position:0%
in the murder of that man because he was
 
09:26:46.630 --> 09:26:46.640 align:start position:0%
alive when he went to work that day so
 
09:26:48.830 --> 09:26:48.840 align:start position:0%
therefore he was stripped of his firearm
 
09:26:51.070 --> 09:26:51.080 align:start position:0%
so rather than say someone who's been
 
09:26:52.630 --> 09:26:52.640 align:start position:0%
committed to a mental institution
 
09:26:54.230 --> 09:26:54.240 align:start position:0%
because they are danger to herself or
 
09:26:56.150 --> 09:26:56.160 align:start position:0%
others we should make it easier for
 
09:26:58.150 --> 09:26:58.160 align:start position:0%
other people to shoot them that that's
 
09:26:59.746 --> 09:26:59.756 align:start position:0%
what he's
 
09:27:03.350 --> 09:27:03.360 align:start position:0%
saying again don't fall for it let's get
 
09:27:06.510 --> 09:27:06.520 align:start position:0%

09:27:08.790 --> 09:27:08.800 align:start position:0%

Speaker Mr Speaker I wish to focus on
 
09:30:46.230 --> 09:30:46.240 align:start position:0%
the confiscation act of this aspect of
 
09:30:48.746 --> 09:30:48.756 align:start position:0%
this bill this aspect goes beyond any
 
09:30:50.310 --> 09:30:50.320 align:start position:0%
requirement of federal
 
09:30:52.710 --> 09:30:52.720 align:start position:0%
law these procedures do not address
 
09:30:54.470 --> 09:30:54.480 align:start position:0%
situations that are well known to be
 
09:30:56.906 --> 09:30:56.916 align:start position:0%
quite common place joint ownership of
 
09:30:58.990 --> 09:30:59.000 align:start position:0%
firearms this can either be by husband
 
09:31:01.470 --> 09:31:01.480 align:start position:0%
and wife or with more extended family
 
09:31:01.480 --> 09:31:02.746 align:start position:0%
and wife or with more extended family
via

09:31:02.746 --> 09:31:02.756 align:start position:0%
via
 
09:31:04.990 --> 09:31:05.000 align:start position:0%
trust this is extremely common place
 
09:31:06.630 --> 09:31:06.640 align:start position:0%
especially with higher value and
 
09:31:08.190 --> 09:31:08.200 align:start position:0%
collectible Firearms as an estate
 
09:31:10.950 --> 09:31:10.960 align:start position:0%
planning tool and for other reasons how
 
09:31:13.190 --> 09:31:13.200 align:start position:0%
common place you may Wonder there's
 
09:31:14.670 --> 09:31:14.680 align:start position:0%
lawyers that specialize in creating
 
09:31:16.266 --> 09:31:16.276 align:start position:0%
these firearm trusts and purpose-made
 
09:31:18.510 --> 09:31:18.520 align:start position:0%
tools for creating these trusts from
 
09:31:20.510 --> 09:31:20.520 align:start position:0%
templates in fact I'm fairly certain
 
09:31:22.070 --> 09:31:22.080 align:start position:0%
there's a kiosk on the counter of a gun
 
09:31:23.426 --> 09:31:23.436 align:start position:0%
store might have town to create and
 
09:31:24.830 --> 09:31:24.840 align:start position:0%
print a trust just before your
 
09:31:26.390 --> 09:31:26.400 align:start position:0%
completing your purchase of the next
 
09:31:28.710 --> 09:31:28.720 align:start position:0%
next counter
 
09:31:31.350 --> 09:31:31.360 align:start position:0%
over Firearms do not have Deeds or
 
09:31:34.070 --> 09:31:34.080 align:start position:0%
registered titles like houses or
 
09:31:36.510 --> 09:31:36.520 align:start position:0%
cars however this law cannot function
 
09:31:39.950 --> 09:31:39.960 align:start position:0%
without that and will lead to firearm
 
09:31:42.030 --> 09:31:42.040 align:start position:0%
registration there are firearms within
 
09:31:43.426 --> 09:31:43.436 align:start position:0%
my family that have been passed down
 
09:31:45.390 --> 09:31:45.400 align:start position:0%
from Generations that have died and it
 
09:31:47.870 --> 09:31:47.880 align:start position:0%
is totally unclear who owns them they
 
09:31:50.470 --> 09:31:50.480 align:start position:0%
weren't line ated in the will and all
 
09:31:51.830 --> 09:31:51.840 align:start position:0%
the descendants can use them if they
 
09:31:53.830 --> 09:31:53.840 align:start position:0%
want to and it's never really been
 
09:31:56.870 --> 09:31:56.880 align:start position:0%
discussed who owns
 
09:31:59.110 --> 09:31:59.120 align:start position:0%
them this bill directs the judge to
 
09:32:02.070 --> 09:32:02.080 align:start position:0%
inquire if the person has access to any
 
09:32:04.550 --> 09:32:04.560 align:start position:0%
Firearms it gives no guidance about what
 
09:32:05.870 --> 09:32:05.880 align:start position:0%
the judge should do with that
 
09:32:08.350 --> 09:32:08.360 align:start position:0%
information should the court or order
 
09:32:11.390 --> 09:32:11.400 align:start position:0%
the owner the of them to remove access
 
09:32:13.746 --> 09:32:13.756 align:start position:0%
or just confiscate them
 
09:32:19.190 --> 09:32:19.200 align:start position:0%
 
09:32:22.266 --> 09:32:22.276 align:start position:0%
problems this bill uh gives discretion
 
09:32:24.470 --> 09:32:24.480 align:start position:0%
to unelected judges to approve transfers
 
09:32:26.470 --> 09:32:26.480 align:start position:0%
of firearms to non-prohibited
 
09:32:28.670 --> 09:32:28.680 align:start position:0%
individuals but without any guidance on
 
09:32:30.586 --> 09:32:30.596 align:start position:0%
the factors to be considered when
 
09:32:32.586 --> 09:32:32.596 align:start position:0%
exercising this
 
09:32:34.950 --> 09:32:34.960 align:start position:0%
discretion this sets up individuals for
 
09:32:36.630 --> 09:32:36.640 align:start position:0%
wildly different treatment depending on
 
09:32:39.470 --> 09:32:39.480 align:start position:0%
 
09:32:41.870 --> 09:32:41.880 align:start position:0%
get faced with all these uncertainties
 
09:32:44.030 --> 09:32:44.040 align:start position:0%
it is abundantly clear that what will
 
09:32:45.746 --> 09:32:45.756 align:start position:0%
happen in the practice is the police
 
09:32:47.150 --> 09:32:47.160 align:start position:0%
decease any and all firearms
 
09:32:49.426 --> 09:32:49.436 align:start position:0%
tangentially related to the individual
 
09:32:51.510 --> 09:32:51.520 align:start position:0%
and let the courts figure it
 
09:32:54.150 --> 09:32:54.160 align:start position:0%
out if passed this bill will infringe on
 
09:32:56.266 --> 09:32:56.276 align:start position:0%
the rights of anyone cohabitating with a
 
09:32:56.276 --> 09:32:58.510 align:start position:0%
the rights of anyone cohabitating with a
prohibited

09:32:58.510 --> 09:32:58.520 align:start position:0%
prohibited
 
09:33:00.906 --> 09:33:00.916 align:start position:0%
person I have had close family members
 
09:33:03.070 --> 09:33:03.080 align:start position:0%
that have experienced Mental Health
 
09:33:06.790 --> 09:33:06.800 align:start position:0%
crisis I am a gun owner and they were as
 
09:33:08.906 --> 09:33:08.916 align:start position:0%
well it was something we had to deal
 
09:33:10.950 --> 09:33:10.960 align:start position:0%
with as part of the
 
09:33:12.870 --> 09:33:12.880 align:start position:0%
situation another aspect of that
 
09:33:14.870 --> 09:33:14.880 align:start position:0%
situation was at one point they couldn't
 
09:33:18.150 --> 09:33:18.160 align:start position:0%
live alone and so as a family we made a
 
09:33:21.150 --> 09:33:21.160 align:start position:0%
plan that plan did involve
 
09:33:23.510 --> 09:33:23.520 align:start position:0%
cohabitating if this bill were a law at
 
09:33:25.830 --> 09:33:25.840 align:start position:0%
that time the option would have been off
 
09:33:28.230 --> 09:33:28.240 align:start position:0%
the table this bill would have been
 
09:33:30.310 --> 09:33:30.320 align:start position:0%
directed to the come from my guns
 
09:33:33.390 --> 09:33:33.400 align:start position:0%
too it would have been put the burden on
 
09:33:35.906 --> 09:33:35.916 align:start position:0%
me to prove ownership of each item a
 
09:33:37.670 --> 09:33:37.680 align:start position:0%
burden I'm not confident I could have
 
09:33:41.470 --> 09:33:41.480 align:start position:0%
met and it's unclear that even if I had
 
09:33:42.630 --> 09:33:42.640 align:start position:0%
if I would have been allowed to keep
 
09:33:43.906 --> 09:33:43.916 align:start position:0%
them in the same
 
09:33:45.906 --> 09:33:45.916 align:start position:0%
household I would have been forced to
 
09:33:47.470 --> 09:33:47.480 align:start position:0%
make a
 
09:33:49.586 --> 09:33:49.596 align:start position:0%
choice that's a terrible thing to do to
 
09:33:53.150 --> 09:33:53.160 align:start position:0%
a family in crisis it'll make the me
 
09:33:55.106 --> 09:33:55.116 align:start position:0%
make mental health issues in our society
 
09:33:58.550 --> 09:33:58.560 align:start position:0%
worse not better it'll erode the support
 
09:34:01.470 --> 09:34:01.480 align:start position:0%
structures that these people have it
 
09:34:03.670 --> 09:34:03.680 align:start position:0%
will make them even more of a pariah and
 
09:34:06.310 --> 09:34:06.320 align:start position:0%
close doors to them it will infringe on
 
09:34:08.470 --> 09:34:08.480 align:start position:0%
the rights of far more people than just
 
09:34:09.550 --> 09:34:09.560 align:start position:0%
those that have been formerly
 
09:34:12.510 --> 09:34:12.520 align:start position:0%
adjudicated as outlined in this bill I
 
09:34:14.070 --> 09:34:14.080 align:start position:0%
urge you to press the red button and
 
09:34:16.190 --> 09:34:16.200 align:start position:0%
vote against this Bill thank you Mr
 
09:34:21.426 --> 09:34:21.436 align:start position:0%
 
09:34:21.436 --> 09:34:24.586 align:start position:0%
 
beler

09:34:24.586 --> 09:34:24.596 align:start position:0%
 
09:34:27.150 --> 09:34:27.160 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker hello colleagues I
 
09:34:29.670 --> 09:34:29.680 align:start position:0%
won't take long with this uh there are
 
09:34:31.630 --> 09:34:31.640 align:start position:0%
portions of this bill that seem entirely
 
09:34:33.510 --> 09:34:33.520 align:start position:0%
reasonable to me unfortunately there are
 
09:34:34.990 --> 09:34:35.000 align:start position:0%
some parts that I have a little bit more
 
09:34:38.030 --> 09:34:38.040 align:start position:0%
concern about there's a long history if
 
09:34:40.190 --> 09:34:40.200 align:start position:0%
we look back on all of the nations in
 
09:34:43.510 --> 09:34:43.520 align:start position:0%
the 20th century of this of this planet
 
09:34:46.030 --> 09:34:46.040 align:start position:0%
where authoritarian or totalitarian
 
09:34:49.230 --> 09:34:49.240 align:start position:0%
regimes made a habit of calling their
 
09:34:51.906 --> 09:34:51.916 align:start position:0%
opposition and dissidence insane and
 
09:34:53.550 --> 09:34:53.560 align:start position:0%
using that premise to remove their
 
09:34:55.550 --> 09:34:55.560 align:start position:0%
rights this happened across every
 
09:34:57.470 --> 09:34:57.480 align:start position:0%
country of the Soviet block this
 
09:35:00.550 --> 09:35:00.560 align:start position:0%
happened in Cuba this happened in China
 
09:35:02.350 --> 09:35:02.360 align:start position:0%
it's happened in a lot of
 
09:35:05.150 --> 09:35:05.160 align:start position:0%
places now why would I bring that up
 
09:35:07.266 --> 09:35:07.276 align:start position:0%
it's not like there's any risk of
 
09:35:09.586 --> 09:35:09.596 align:start position:0%
something like that ever happening here
 
09:35:12.670 --> 09:35:12.680 align:start position:0%
right there's no totalitarian or
 
09:35:16.106 --> 09:35:16.116 align:start position:0%
authoritarian or suppressive movements
 
09:35:17.870 --> 09:35:17.880 align:start position:0%
happening in the United States of
 
09:35:21.630 --> 09:35:21.640 align:start position:0%
America right let me read you just one
 
09:35:25.106 --> 09:35:25.116 align:start position:0%
one statement one line from the mission
 
09:35:28.670 --> 09:35:28.680 align:start position:0%
statement of the American Psychological
 
09:35:31.150 --> 09:35:31.160 align:start position:0%
Association the APA is committed to the
 
09:35:33.106 --> 09:35:33.116 align:start position:0%
infusing the principles of equity
 
09:35:35.266 --> 09:35:35.276 align:start position:0%
diversity and inclusion into all aspects
 
09:35:36.790 --> 09:35:36.800 align:start position:0%
of the work we
 
09:35:39.990 --> 09:35:40.000 align:start position:0%
do thank you please vote
 
09:35:46.746 --> 09:35:46.756 align:start position:0%
 
09:35:49.790 --> 09:35:49.800 align:start position:0%
Roy thank you Mr Speaker M okay so a
 
09:35:52.710 --> 09:35:52.720 align:start position:0%
couple things um first first of all you
 
09:35:54.510 --> 09:35:54.520 align:start position:0%
may wonder where did where did I get
 
09:35:56.266 --> 09:35:56.276 align:start position:0%
this uh this language from because you
 
09:35:57.630 --> 09:35:57.640 align:start position:0%
know we hear this part's a little
 
09:35:59.426 --> 09:35:59.436 align:start position:0%
problematic that part's a little
 
09:36:01.630 --> 09:36:01.640 align:start position:0%
problematic I got this language from the
 
09:36:03.830 --> 09:36:03.840 align:start position:0%
NRA that's where I got this language
 
09:36:07.510 --> 09:36:07.520 align:start position:0%
from I got this language from the NRA I
 
09:36:10.470 --> 09:36:10.480 align:start position:0%
got this language from 48 other states
 
09:36:13.106 --> 09:36:13.116 align:start position:0%
that have this bill I haven't heard of
 
09:36:15.550 --> 09:36:15.560 align:start position:0%
anybody um in all these states that have
 
09:36:18.030 --> 09:36:18.040 align:start position:0%
had this for years anyone who's been
 
09:36:20.310 --> 09:36:20.320 align:start position:0%
lost their guns because of anorexia I
 
09:36:22.350 --> 09:36:22.360 align:start position:0%
haven't heard of any any other issues
 
09:36:23.746 --> 09:36:23.756 align:start position:0%
with regard to the representative's
 
09:36:27.190 --> 09:36:27.200 align:start position:0%
question about confiscation of guns um I
 
09:36:29.266 --> 09:36:29.276 align:start position:0%
worked very closely with nami on this
 
09:36:31.426 --> 09:36:31.436 align:start position:0%
issue I made sure that people had a
 
09:36:32.906 --> 09:36:32.916 align:start position:0%
choice their guns are not going to be
 
09:36:34.426 --> 09:36:34.436 align:start position:0%
confiscated and brought to some police
 
09:36:36.550 --> 09:36:36.560 align:start position:0%
locker and thrown in a closet they the
 
09:36:38.070 --> 09:36:38.080 align:start position:0%
people have a choice of where they can
 
09:36:39.870 --> 09:36:39.880 align:start position:0%
go they can transfer them to a friend
 
09:36:42.950 --> 09:36:42.960 align:start position:0%
relative an FFL we went out of our way
 
09:36:45.350 --> 09:36:45.360 align:start position:0%
to make sure that our bill while
 
09:36:48.266 --> 09:36:48.276 align:start position:0%
complying with the federal statutes has
 
09:36:50.990 --> 09:36:51.000 align:start position:0%
more freedom than any other states the
 
09:36:52.670 --> 09:36:52.680 align:start position:0%
person could choose where they fire arms
 
09:36:56.030 --> 09:36:56.040 align:start position:0%
go who gets them so we we worked very
 
09:36:58.950 --> 09:36:58.960 align:start position:0%
carefully also the language I worked
 
09:37:01.266 --> 09:37:01.276 align:start position:0%
with nami I worked with the attorney
 
09:37:03.266 --> 09:37:03.276 align:start position:0%
general and I worked with the courts all
 
09:37:05.350 --> 09:37:05.360 align:start position:0%
of them looked at this language very
 
09:37:09.426 --> 09:37:09.436 align:start position:0%
specifically it went through 12 13 maybe
 
09:37:12.550 --> 09:37:12.560 align:start position:0%
more edits before it was just right and
 
09:37:13.830 --> 09:37:13.840 align:start position:0%
more importantly what I haven't heard
 
09:37:16.906 --> 09:37:16.916 align:start position:0%
anyone say is there's a restoration of
 
09:37:19.830 --> 09:37:19.840 align:start position:0%
Rights process in this bill right now
 
09:37:22.510 --> 09:37:22.520 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire does not have one you
 
09:37:24.830 --> 09:37:24.840 align:start position:0%
cannot ever in your life get your
 
09:37:28.190 --> 09:37:28.200 align:start position:0%
Firearms back if they are listed for a a
 
09:37:30.470 --> 09:37:30.480 align:start position:0%
mental health thing right now there's
 
09:37:32.150 --> 09:37:32.160 align:start position:0%
over a thousand people on that list from
 
09:37:34.106 --> 09:37:34.116 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and more can be added all
 
09:37:35.470 --> 09:37:35.480 align:start position:0%
the time because this isn't the only way
 
09:37:37.746 --> 09:37:37.756 align:start position:0%
you can get on there so if you are
 
09:37:39.710 --> 09:37:39.720 align:start position:0%
listed for example if you go to your
 
09:37:41.670 --> 09:37:41.680 align:start position:0%
doctor and you tell your doctor I'm
 
09:37:43.550 --> 09:37:43.560 align:start position:0%
thinking about killing myself and the
 
09:37:45.350 --> 09:37:45.360 align:start position:0%
doctor believes you they have to report
 
09:37:47.230 --> 09:37:47.240 align:start position:0%
that to the Department of Safety who can
 
09:37:50.190 --> 09:37:50.200 align:start position:0%
report that to Nyx right now without
 
09:37:52.670 --> 09:37:52.680 align:start position:0%
this so there's names on list right now
 
09:37:54.550 --> 09:37:54.560 align:start position:0%
from New Hampshire for people that
 
09:37:56.350 --> 09:37:56.360 align:start position:0%
cannot buy firearms because of mental
 
09:37:58.350 --> 09:37:58.360 align:start position:0%
health disabilities and they are banned
 
09:38:00.630 --> 09:38:00.640 align:start position:0%
for the rest of their life because the
 
09:38:02.106 --> 09:38:02.116 align:start position:0%
federal government will not remove
 
09:38:04.190 --> 09:38:04.200 align:start position:0%
anyone's name from that list unless your
 
09:38:07.510 --> 09:38:07.520 align:start position:0%
state has an approved restoration of
 
09:38:10.746 --> 09:38:10.756 align:start position:0%
rights program in law I put that in this
 
09:38:13.990 --> 09:38:14.000 align:start position:0%
bill and what's more not one name from
 
09:38:15.790 --> 09:38:15.800 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is allowed to go on that
 
09:38:18.350 --> 09:38:18.360 align:start position:0%
list until the restoration of rights
 
09:38:20.950 --> 09:38:20.960 align:start position:0%
program is approved by the ATF that
 
09:38:23.310 --> 09:38:23.320 align:start position:0%
means if no one's name can go on get off
 
09:38:26.030 --> 09:38:26.040 align:start position:0%
no one's name goes on so we put so many
 
09:38:28.350 --> 09:38:28.360 align:start position:0%
Protections in this there's only so much
 
09:38:29.350 --> 09:38:29.360 align:start position:0%
we can
 
09:38:33.106 --> 09:38:33.116 align:start position:0%
do I made sure that we are protecting
 
09:38:35.190 --> 09:38:35.200 align:start position:0%
people and I'm protecting Second
 
09:38:37.310 --> 09:38:37.320 align:start position:0%
Amendment gun owners at the same time
 
09:38:40.350 --> 09:38:40.360 align:start position:0%
the way such States as Florida and Texas
 
09:38:42.990 --> 09:38:43.000 align:start position:0%
and Alaska have also done and if you
 
09:38:45.150 --> 09:38:45.160 align:start position:0%
think that they're not proun States I
 
09:38:47.190 --> 09:38:47.200 align:start position:0%
suggest you need to do a little research
 
09:38:50.150 --> 09:38:50.160 align:start position:0%
please support this let's get this out
 
09:38:51.746 --> 09:38:51.756 align:start position:0%
and make sure that another tragedy
 
09:38:53.510 --> 09:38:53.520 align:start position:0%
doesn't Happ happen and we don't end up
 
09:38:55.746 --> 09:38:55.756 align:start position:0%
with the real red flag bill because we
 
09:38:57.070 --> 09:38:57.080 align:start position:0%
just discussed about what's going to
 
09:38:59.106 --> 09:38:59.116 align:start position:0%
happen when bills get over there well
 
09:39:00.266 --> 09:39:00.276 align:start position:0%
what happens when there's different
 
09:39:01.670 --> 09:39:01.680 align:start position:0%
people over there and in the corner
 
09:39:04.190 --> 09:39:04.200 align:start position:0%
office think about that this is our
 
09:39:06.990 --> 09:39:07.000 align:start position:0%
chance to put our Line in the Sand that
 
09:39:09.990 --> 09:39:10.000 align:start position:0%
we agree something has to be done but
 
09:39:14.106 --> 09:39:14.116 align:start position:0%
not take everyone's guns thank
 
09:39:17.230 --> 09:39:17.240 align:start position:0%
you the mo the motion before us is aut
 
09:39:20.350 --> 09:39:20.360 align:start position:0%
to pass on House Bill

telephone we also o had a
 
09:52:56.790 --> 09:52:56.800 align:start position:0%
vote that was differential only by three
 
09:52:58.950 --> 09:52:58.960 align:start position:0%
votes back on the
 
09:53:01.510 --> 09:53:01.520 align:start position:0%
21st and late in the

day the bill
 
09:53:09.070 --> 09:53:09.080 align:start position:0%
before 1283 had about 373 members
 
09:53:13.870 --> 09:53:13.880 align:start position:0%
present by the time this 1283 was voted
 
09:53:16.390 --> 09:53:16.400 align:start position:0%
on about
 
09:53:20.106 --> 09:53:20.116 align:start position:0%
430 we ended up with
 
09:53:24.470 --> 09:53:24.480 align:start position:0%
355 so we had 17 or so members not
 
09:53:27.190 --> 09:53:27.200 align:start position:0%
present maybe because of the one minute
 
09:53:29.830 --> 09:53:29.840 align:start position:0%
rule maybe because of people taking a
 
09:53:34.266 --> 09:53:34.276 align:start position:0%
break who knows but this bill must be
 
09:53:36.950 --> 09:53:36.960 align:start position:0%
considered and it's important enough to
 
09:53:40.586 --> 09:53:40.596 align:start position:0%

this reconsideration of the Medical Aid
 
09:54:54.350 --> 09:54:54.360 align:start position:0%

09:54:57.106 --> 09:54:57.116 align:start position:0%
legislation we have dedicated over an
 
09:54:59.106 --> 09:54:59.116 align:start position:0%
hour to thoughtful and impassion
 
09:55:02.190 --> 09:55:02.200 align:start position:0%
speeches elucidating the significance of

09:55:06.990 --> 09:55:07.000 align:start position:0%
H it has on the lives of our citizens to
 
09:55:09.586 --> 09:55:09.596 align:start position:0%
attain another hour of debate would only
 
09:55:12.106 --> 09:55:12.116 align:start position:0%
be redundant but also disrespectful to
 
09:55:13.990 --> 09:55:14.000 align:start position:0%
the weightly deliberations that have
 
09:55:16.670 --> 09:55:16.680 align:start position:0%
already taken place while I'm committed
 
09:55:19.550 --> 09:55:19.560 align:start position:0%

09:55:23.790 --> 09:55:23.800 align:start position:0%
on this matter I am apprehensive that
 
09:55:25.550 --> 09:55:25.560 align:start position:0%
the additional discourse will sway those
 
09:55:28.190 --> 09:55:28.200 align:start position:0%
members who priori State control over
 
09:55:31.150 --> 09:55:31.160 align:start position:0%
individual autonomy the right to make
 
09:55:33.870 --> 09:55:33.880 align:start position:0%
decisions regarding one's own life and
 
09:55:36.070 --> 09:55:36.080 align:start position:0%
end of Life Care should be subject not
 
09:55:38.070 --> 09:55:38.080 align:start position:0%
subject to governmental interference and
 
09:55:40.790 --> 09:55:40.800 align:start position:0%
it is imperative that we uphold the
 
09:55:42.426 --> 09:55:42.436 align:start position:0%
principles of personal freedom and
 
09:55:45.230 --> 09:55:45.240 align:start position:0%
dignity in matters as deeply personal as
 
09:55:47.390 --> 09:55:47.400 align:start position:0%
this therefore I urge my esteemed
 
09:55:50.350 --> 09:55:50.360 align:start position:0%
colleagues to stand firm in their convi
 
09:55:52.510 --> 09:55:52.520 align:start position:0%
convictions and resist the call for
 
09:55:54.630 --> 09:55:54.640 align:start position:0%
reconsideration let us honor the
 
09:55:56.230 --> 09:55:56.240 align:start position:0%
deliberative process that has brought us
 
09:55:57.906 --> 09:55:57.916 align:start position:0%
to this point and focus our efforts on

09:56:57.906 --> 09:56:57.916 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker two
 
09:56:59.470 --> 09:56:59.480 align:start position:0%
weeks ago you had
 
09:57:02.470 --> 09:57:02.480 align:start position:0%
laryngitis and you to asked if I would
 
09:57:04.790 --> 09:57:04.800 align:start position:0%
give the deputy speaker a well-deserved
 
09:57:07.350 --> 09:57:07.360 align:start position:0%
break and I was very happy to do it and
 
09:57:09.150 --> 09:57:09.160 align:start position:0%
to be back at the podium again brought
 
09:57:12.710 --> 09:57:12.720 align:start position:0%
back a lot of wonderful memories for me
 
09:57:14.870 --> 09:57:14.880 align:start position:0%
a few days after that I had a a friend
 
09:57:17.106 --> 09:57:17.116 align:start position:0%
from the Republican caucus asked me a
 
09:57:19.670 --> 09:57:19.680 align:start position:0%
question he said Steve you up at the
 
09:57:22.790 --> 09:57:22.800 align:start position:0%
podium as speaker what would you do if
 
09:57:25.310 --> 09:57:25.320 align:start position:0%
there was a tie vote would you vote with
 
09:57:27.030 --> 09:57:27.040 align:start position:0%
us the majority
 
09:57:30.106 --> 09:57:30.116 align:start position:0%
Republicans or would you feel obliged to
 
09:57:32.470 --> 09:57:32.480 align:start position:0%
vote with your Democratic
 
09:57:34.350 --> 09:57:34.360 align:start position:0%
colleagues and I said you know that's
 
09:57:37.310 --> 09:57:37.320 align:start position:0%
really a wonderful question but for me
 
09:57:39.470 --> 09:57:39.480 align:start position:0%
it's an easy question to
 
09:57:43.150 --> 09:57:43.160 align:start position:0%
ask um you know for eight years I was
 
09:57:45.390 --> 09:57:45.400 align:start position:0%
Democratic leader and I always told our
 
09:57:48.390 --> 09:57:48.400 align:start position:0%
caucus at the end of our caucuses ad
 
09:57:51.106 --> 09:57:51.116 align:start position:0%
nauseum that remember you always vote
 
09:57:52.990 --> 09:57:53.000 align:start position:0%
your conscience you always vote your
 
09:57:55.310 --> 09:57:55.320 align:start position:0%
district and if you can you vote your
 
09:57:58.190 --> 09:57:58.200 align:start position:0%
party and so if we had a tie vote I
 
09:57:59.950 --> 09:57:59.960 align:start position:0%
wouldn't necessarily vote with Democrats
 
09:58:02.510 --> 09:58:02.520 align:start position:0%
or Republicans I'd vote what my
 
09:58:04.070 --> 09:58:04.080 align:start position:0%
conscience told me to
 
09:58:06.670 --> 09:58:06.680 align:start position:0%
do when we took up this bill on the
 
09:58:09.070 --> 09:58:09.080 align:start position:0%
house floor I struggled like a lot of
 
09:58:12.630 --> 09:58:12.640 align:start position:0%
you here on how to vote for moral
 
09:58:15.106 --> 09:58:15.116 align:start position:0%
grounds religious reasons and so many
 
09:58:17.390 --> 09:58:17.400 align:start position:0%
others and when I walked into this
 
09:58:19.310 --> 09:58:19.320 align:start position:0%
chamber I still wasn't sure how I was
 
09:58:22.266 --> 09:58:22.276 align:start position:0%
going to vote we had an hours long
 
09:58:24.230 --> 09:58:24.240 align:start position:0%
debate and we had excellent speeches on
 
09:58:26.310 --> 09:58:26.320 align:start position:0%
both sides of the aisle and on both
 
09:58:27.390 --> 09:58:27.400 align:start position:0%
sides of the
 
09:58:30.550 --> 09:58:30.560 align:start position:0%
issue one speak speech in particular
 
09:58:34.790 --> 09:58:34.800 align:start position:0%
resonated with me and when the vote came
 
09:58:38.586 --> 09:58:38.596 align:start position:0%
I pushed the red V button I voted no on
 
09:58:42.630 --> 09:58:42.640 align:start position:0%
this as I said we had an hourlong debate
 
09:58:44.950 --> 09:58:44.960 align:start position:0%
we had excellent commentary from people
 
09:58:47.350 --> 09:58:47.360 align:start position:0%
on both sides of this
 
09:58:50.266 --> 09:58:50.276 align:start position:0%
question but now is the time in the
 
09:58:52.906 --> 09:58:52.916 align:start position:0%
Democrat process that this bill move on
 
09:58:55.550 --> 09:58:55.560 align:start position:0%
