right good morning
 
00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:45.600 align:start position:0%
afternoon something like that it's one
 
00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:48.520 align:start position:0%
or the other I'm pretty sure all right
 
00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:51.800 align:start position:0%
we the major item we are going to do
 
00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:55.280 align:start position:0%
today is have Senator Bradley Bradley
 
00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:57.600 align:start position:0%
explained to us his funding constraints
 
00:04:59.629 --> 00:04:59.639 align:start position:0%
now that we have the September Revenue
 
00:05:03.909 --> 00:05:03.919 align:start position:0%
use and I believe he is on his way does
 
00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:07.360 align:start position:0%
anyone have anything else of importance
 
00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:08.230 align:start position:0%
anyone have anything else of importance
to

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:08.240 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:13.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:16.880 align:start position:0%
here oh dear me all right I don't see
 
00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:20.120 align:start position:0%
much either so
 
00:05:23.309 --> 00:05:23.319 align:start position:0%
um in that case I'll just give a summary
 
00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:26.680 align:start position:0%
of what where I think we're going if we
 
00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:30.960 align:start position:0%
can agree on any of the plans that have
 
00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:32.029 align:start position:0%
can agree on any of the plans that have
been

00:05:32.029 --> 00:05:32.039 align:start position:0%
been
 
00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:34.800 align:start position:0%
suggested we will make a recommendation
 
00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:36.240 align:start position:0%
to the
 
00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:39.360 align:start position:0%
legislature if we think if we don't have
 
00:05:42.749 --> 00:05:42.759 align:start position:0%
one that we're ready to recommend today
 
00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:45.680 align:start position:0%
which I have no idea if that's possible
 
00:05:47.309 --> 00:05:47.319 align:start position:0%
if that might
 
00:05:51.029 --> 00:05:51.039 align:start position:0%
happen then I think we will not meet
 
00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:53.600 align:start position:0%
again for until we do have something to
 
00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:55.360 align:start position:0%
talk about we've done a lot of
 
00:05:57.790 --> 00:05:57.800 align:start position:0%
brainstorming and thrown a lot of ideas
 
00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:01.280 align:start position:0%
out there but if we don't don't have a a
 
00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:04.600 align:start position:0%
plan that we can recommend to implement
 
00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:07.560 align:start position:0%
then you know it's just just a bunch of
 
00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:10.120 align:start position:0%
us getting together to chat and I'm not
 
00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:11.680 align:start position:0%
sure we need to do
 
00:06:16.749 --> 00:06:16.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:19.720 align:start position:0%
comments okay anyone
 
00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:22.680 align:start position:0%
else all
 
00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:25.080 align:start position:0%
right yes
 
00:06:28.469 --> 00:06:28.479 align:start position:0%
Senator I don't know you know Senator
 
00:06:28.479 --> 00:06:30.390 align:start position:0%
Senator I don't know you know Senator
com

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:30.400 align:start position:0%
com
 
00:06:32.029 --> 00:06:32.039 align:start position:0%
I don't know but it looks like it she
 
00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:35.400 align:start position:0%
left her uh her her paperwork so maybe
 
00:06:37.749 --> 00:06:37.759 align:start position:0%
we need yes I'm sorry maybe we need to
 
00:06:39.589 --> 00:06:39.599 align:start position:0%
pause briefly because I I do know that
 
00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:41.560 align:start position:0%
there is some Hope on the Senate side
 
00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:44.360 align:start position:0%
that we would have something that would
 
00:06:46.749 --> 00:06:46.759 align:start position:0%
be agreeable and that we could look at
 
00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:50.160 align:start position:0%
today and I understand the cost of the
 
00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:52.080 align:start position:0%
of the proposal has come down even a
 
00:06:54.309 --> 00:06:54.319 align:start position:0%
little more some more work so I hope
 
00:06:56.350 --> 00:06:56.360 align:start position:0%
that we'll be able to have something
 
00:06:58.550 --> 00:06:58.560 align:start position:0%
because um you know on the Senate side
 
00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:00.680 align:start position:0%
uh we had a lot of conversation the last
 
00:07:03.869 --> 00:07:03.879 align:start position:0%
day of session at on the four and our
 
00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:05.720 align:start position:0%
Senate President suggested that we might
 
00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:07.680 align:start position:0%
be able to bring something forward on
 
00:07:09.749 --> 00:07:09.759 align:start position:0%
veto day so I think that is still a hope
 
00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:12.800 align:start position:0%
but it depends on us all getting to it
 
00:07:16.629 --> 00:07:16.639 align:start position:0%
depends on us doesn't it yes thank you
 
00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:18.120 align:start position:0%
well if no one else has another
 
00:07:19.950 --> 00:07:19.960 align:start position:0%
suggestion I think we will take a
 
00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:23.120 align:start position:0%
15minute recess so that our delinquent
 
00:07:28.309 --> 00:07:28.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:28.319 --> 00:18:30.710 align:start position:0%
 
you

00:18:30.710 --> 00:18:30.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:33.590 --> 00:18:33.600 align:start position:0%
all right since we are all seem to be
 
00:18:36.750 --> 00:18:36.760 align:start position:0%
here uh Senator Bradley you were going
 
00:18:41.630 --> 00:18:41.640 align:start position:0%
to report on revenues and talk
 
00:18:44.990 --> 00:18:45.000 align:start position:0%
about your uh your
 
00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:46.549 align:start position:0%
about your uh your
recommendations

00:18:46.549 --> 00:18:46.559 align:start position:0%
recommendations
 
00:18:49.310 --> 00:18:49.320 align:start position:0%
okay thank you madam chair um good
 
00:18:51.149 --> 00:18:51.159 align:start position:0%
afternoon everybody
 
00:18:55.350 --> 00:18:55.360 align:start position:0%
so uh we do have uh September revenues
 
00:18:57.909 --> 00:18:57.919 align:start position:0%
now so September was actually a pretty
 
00:19:03.110 --> 00:19:03.120 align:start position:0%
good month uh $37 million above
 
00:19:06.590 --> 00:19:06.600 align:start position:0%
expectation um which for the
 
00:19:13.390 --> 00:19:13.400 align:start position:0%
year was a 36.4 million above plan um
 
00:19:15.350 --> 00:19:15.360 align:start position:0%
so that's
 
00:19:19.510 --> 00:19:19.520 align:start position:0%
good um but I
 
00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:21.549 align:start position:0%
good um but I
think

00:19:21.549 --> 00:19:21.559 align:start position:0%
think
 
00:19:24.630 --> 00:19:24.640 align:start position:0%
when you look at the two proposals that
 
00:19:29.149 --> 00:19:29.159 align:start position:0%
I've put out the amendment 2259 and 58
 
00:19:31.990 --> 00:19:32.000 align:start position:0%
the 2.5% multiplier and the
 
00:19:37.630 --> 00:19:37.640 align:start position:0%
2 um 25 and 2.5 the price tag on both of
 
00:19:40.789 --> 00:19:40.799 align:start position:0%
them is you know significantly higher
 
00:19:42.990 --> 00:19:43.000 align:start position:0%
and as I keep
 
00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:44.590 align:start position:0%
and as I keep
stressing

00:19:44.590 --> 00:19:44.600 align:start position:0%
stressing
 
00:19:48.350 --> 00:19:48.360 align:start position:0%
um there's going to be an impact at some
 
00:19:51.950 --> 00:19:51.960 align:start position:0%
point in time of the YDC settlement
 
00:19:56.669 --> 00:19:56.679 align:start position:0%
process so um
 
00:20:00.310 --> 00:20:00.320 align:start position:0%
I keep cas Cas in about for ways to try
 
00:20:04.110 --> 00:20:04.120 align:start position:0%
and you know get these costs down um
 
00:20:06.909 --> 00:20:06.919 align:start position:0%
which is you know why I propose the
 
00:20:06.919 --> 00:20:08.070 align:start position:0%
which is you know why I propose the
split

00:20:08.070 --> 00:20:08.080 align:start position:0%
split
 
00:20:11.270 --> 00:20:11.280 align:start position:0%
multiplier um one thing that came back
 
00:20:13.750 --> 00:20:13.760 align:start position:0%
to us from Marty and maybe he can
 
00:20:17.830 --> 00:20:17.840 align:start position:0%
address this is GRS the
 
00:20:22.630 --> 00:20:22.640 align:start position:0%
actuary uh did take Brian your
 
00:20:26.990 --> 00:20:27.000 align:start position:0%
suggestions and run a scenario on it but
 
00:20:30.270 --> 00:20:30.280 align:start position:0%
because it was complicated ated um they
 
00:20:33.549 --> 00:20:33.559 align:start position:0%
only did it for the 2.5% multiplier they
 
00:20:37.110 --> 00:20:37.120 align:start position:0%
need to run a full analysis for the
 
00:20:43.149 --> 00:20:43.159 align:start position:0%
second multiplier of 2.25 and 2.5 so
 
00:20:45.029 --> 00:20:45.039 align:start position:0%
I've spoken with a speaker I would have
 
00:20:45.039 --> 00:20:45.870 align:start position:0%
I've spoken with a speaker I would have
no

00:20:45.870 --> 00:20:45.880 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:20:45.880 --> 00:20:48.390 align:start position:0%
no
problem

00:20:48.390 --> 00:20:48.400 align:start position:0%
problem
 
00:20:51.149 --> 00:20:51.159 align:start position:0%
um you know that we move forward and ask
 
00:20:55.990 --> 00:20:56.000 align:start position:0%
GRS to you know do the same for that
 
00:20:58.350 --> 00:20:58.360 align:start position:0%
version according to what Mar already
 
00:21:00.549 --> 00:21:00.559 align:start position:0%
got back to us with and this is maybe
 
00:21:02.230 --> 00:21:02.240 align:start position:0%
where you would be able to answer
 
00:21:05.390 --> 00:21:05.400 align:start position:0%
questions going with Brian's
 
00:21:08.390 --> 00:21:08.400 align:start position:0%
suggestions of tying it to the date that
 
00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:09.149 align:start position:0%
suggestions of tying it to the date that
you

00:21:09.149 --> 00:21:09.159 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:21:11.149 --> 00:21:11.159 align:start position:0%
retire um
 
00:21:13.630 --> 00:21:13.640 align:start position:0%
decreases the terminal funding by about
 
00:21:16.990 --> 00:21:17.000 align:start position:0%
$14 million so would bring the
 
00:21:22.510 --> 00:21:22.520 align:start position:0%
92.6 down to um 78.6 I believe
 
00:21:25.310 --> 00:21:25.320 align:start position:0%
approximately it
 
00:21:25.320 --> 00:21:27.029 align:start position:0%
approximately it
was

00:21:27.029 --> 00:21:27.039 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:21:27.039 --> 00:21:28.789 align:start position:0%
was
so

00:21:28.789 --> 00:21:28.799 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:21:30.549 --> 00:21:30.559 align:start position:0%
that's correct Senator Bradley your
 
00:21:37.950 --> 00:21:37.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:40.909 --> 00:21:40.919 align:start position:0%
questions um would it be fair to say
 
00:21:42.390 --> 00:21:42.400 align:start position:0%
that with
 
00:21:44.830 --> 00:21:44.840 align:start position:0%
the the other plan the revised
 
00:21:48.110 --> 00:21:48.120 align:start position:0%
multiplier it would the change should be
 
00:21:49.830 --> 00:21:49.840 align:start position:0%
expected to be the same order of
 
00:21:53.789 --> 00:21:53.799 align:start position:0%
magnitude but not as much um this this
 
00:21:55.470 --> 00:21:55.480 align:start position:0%
one has a couple of additional moving
 
00:21:55.480 --> 00:21:56.630 align:start position:0%
one has a couple of additional moving
Parts

00:21:56.630 --> 00:21:56.640 align:start position:0%
Parts
 
00:21:59.789 --> 00:21:59.799 align:start position:0%
2259 uh because because of the reduction
 
00:22:02.029 --> 00:22:02.039 align:start position:0%
in the age in service for the the five
 
00:22:05.710 --> 00:22:05.720 align:start position:0%
to 10 year people so I I don't if GRS
 
00:22:07.029 --> 00:22:07.039 align:start position:0%
was here they'd be kicking me under the
 
00:22:09.990 --> 00:22:10.000 align:start position:0%
table saying I can't give a full answer
 
00:22:12.350 --> 00:22:12.360 align:start position:0%
on that with any great certainty it will
 
00:22:13.789 --> 00:22:13.799 align:start position:0%
it obviously will be lower than the
 
00:22:16.390 --> 00:22:16.400 align:start position:0%
current cost because a a portion of the
 
00:22:18.830 --> 00:22:18.840 align:start position:0%
membership is excluded from that those
 
00:22:21.390 --> 00:22:21.400 align:start position:0%
expected not to reach the the service
 
00:22:23.430 --> 00:22:23.440 align:start position:0%
retire go to service
 
00:22:26.669 --> 00:22:26.679 align:start position:0%
retirement okay all right does anyone
 
00:22:28.710 --> 00:22:28.720 align:start position:0%
else have senator
 
00:22:30.909 --> 00:22:30.919 align:start position:0%
water thank you madam chair and um so
 
00:22:33.549 --> 00:22:33.559 align:start position:0%
Marty does these most these most recent
 
00:22:36.029 --> 00:22:36.039 align:start position:0%
calculations um take into account any
 
00:22:38.590 --> 00:22:38.600 align:start position:0%
reduction in the size of the pool the
 
00:22:41.470 --> 00:22:41.480 align:start position:0%
numbers that might be covered it didn't
 
00:22:42.830 --> 00:22:42.840 align:start position:0%
um and and there's a little bit of
 
00:22:44.750 --> 00:22:44.760 align:start position:0%
background on that that that's sort of
 
00:22:46.110 --> 00:22:46.120 align:start position:0%
the the
 
00:22:49.070 --> 00:22:49.080 align:start position:0%
standard Actuarial practice for all
 
00:22:51.110 --> 00:22:51.120 align:start position:0%
fiscal analysis of bill so that they all
 
00:22:53.590 --> 00:22:53.600 align:start position:0%
have the same Baseline so we're working
 
00:22:56.110 --> 00:22:56.120 align:start position:0%
off the you know the prior fiscal year
 
00:22:59.190 --> 00:22:59.200 align:start position:0%
data there there is obviously a decline
 
00:23:01.470 --> 00:23:01.480 align:start position:0%
in the population since then of of
 
00:23:04.110 --> 00:23:04.120 align:start position:0%
people who've left service so that that
 
00:23:08.430 --> 00:23:08.440 align:start position:0%
will have a reduction on the um you know
 
00:23:10.710 --> 00:23:10.720 align:start position:0%
on the actual cost shown here to some
 
00:23:13.630 --> 00:23:13.640 align:start position:0%
extent but you know it's it's it's it's
 
00:23:17.430 --> 00:23:17.440 align:start position:0%
that that reduction in the cost is
 
00:23:19.230 --> 00:23:19.240 align:start position:0%
depending on when is the effective day
 
00:23:21.789 --> 00:23:21.799 align:start position:0%
how many people are going to be you know
 
00:23:23.830 --> 00:23:23.840 align:start position:0%
there at the time you know if if this if
 
00:23:26.190 --> 00:23:26.200 align:start position:0%
something were to pass so but it is it
 
00:23:28.750 --> 00:23:28.760 align:start position:0%
is safe to say and and GRS would be okay
 
00:23:30.549 --> 00:23:30.559 align:start position:0%
with that that you know because the
 
00:23:33.470 --> 00:23:33.480 align:start position:0%
population is declining you know over
 
00:23:35.990 --> 00:23:36.000 align:start position:0%
time you know these numbers are based on
 
00:23:37.630 --> 00:23:37.640 align:start position:0%
a larger population so it's going to be
 
00:23:39.269 --> 00:23:39.279 align:start position:0%
a little bit
 
00:23:42.230 --> 00:23:42.240 align:start position:0%
less okay thank you other question
 
00:23:45.470 --> 00:23:45.480 align:start position:0%
Senator Susi if I may in the amendment
 
00:23:48.149 --> 00:23:48.159 align:start position:0%
for 2259 and not to get you in trouble
 
00:23:51.549 --> 00:23:51.559 align:start position:0%
with GRS Marty but do do you have a
 
00:23:54.630 --> 00:23:54.640 align:start position:0%
rough idea of what portion of the
 
00:23:59.310 --> 00:23:59.320 align:start position:0%
membership is would fall under the 2.25
 
00:24:01.110 --> 00:24:01.120 align:start position:0%
is that the larger portion or is that
 
00:24:03.190 --> 00:24:03.200 align:start position:0%
the smaller portion let me see if I have
 
00:24:04.750 --> 00:24:04.760 align:start position:0%
that with me I might not have brought
 
00:24:08.549 --> 00:24:08.559 align:start position:0%
that particular document today
 
00:24:11.390 --> 00:24:11.400 align:start position:0%
um I I don't have that with me I can I
 
00:24:14.070 --> 00:24:14.080 align:start position:0%
can I can email the commission we have
 
00:24:16.510 --> 00:24:16.520 align:start position:0%
that number I think it was on some of
 
00:24:18.470 --> 00:24:18.480 align:start position:0%
the handouts that might have got posted
 
00:24:21.310 --> 00:24:21.320 align:start position:0%
prior to the uh to the beginning of the
 
00:24:22.950 --> 00:24:22.960 align:start position:0%
commission convening but I'll I'll dig
 
00:24:24.110 --> 00:24:24.120 align:start position:0%
that out I should have had that with me
 
00:24:27.310 --> 00:24:27.320 align:start position:0%
is this page Marty yeah uh no it's it's
 
00:24:30.870 --> 00:24:30.880 align:start position:0%
the color bars um so might it was on a
 
00:24:32.830 --> 00:24:32.840 align:start position:0%
previous handout which unfortunately I
 
00:24:35.789 --> 00:24:35.799 align:start position:0%
didn't I didn't bring along if you could
 
00:24:37.149 --> 00:24:37.159 align:start position:0%
provide it that would be helpful thank
 
00:24:39.789 --> 00:24:39.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:39.799 --> 00:24:42.549 align:start position:0%
 
thing

00:24:42.549 --> 00:24:42.559 align:start position:0%
thing
 
00:24:45.149 --> 00:24:45.159 align:start position:0%
Senator thank you madam chair and this
 
00:24:47.470 --> 00:24:47.480 align:start position:0%
is maybe as much for Senator Bradley as
 
00:24:50.190 --> 00:24:50.200 align:start position:0%
for Marty I mean I know our goal is to
 
00:24:53.350 --> 00:24:53.360 align:start position:0%
terminally fund uh and I understand
 
00:24:55.590 --> 00:24:55.600 align:start position:0%
certainly despite the good revenues the
 
00:24:58.389 --> 00:24:58.399 align:start position:0%
big uncertainties that we face
 
00:25:01.430 --> 00:25:01.440 align:start position:0%
um but Senator Bradley do you think
 
00:25:03.990 --> 00:25:04.000 align:start position:0%
there are ways in which we could um
 
00:25:08.350 --> 00:25:08.360 align:start position:0%
terminally fund but have the funding um
 
00:25:10.990 --> 00:25:11.000 align:start position:0%
be spread out over a little longer time
 
00:25:15.389 --> 00:25:15.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:18.350 --> 00:25:18.360 align:start position:0%
immediately so that would be a question
 
00:25:19.470 --> 00:25:19.480 align:start position:0%
that I'd want
 
00:25:21.990 --> 00:25:22.000 align:start position:0%
to maybe this committee would want to
 
00:25:29.149 --> 00:25:29.159 align:start position:0%
invite mik Kaine to talk about um
 
00:25:32.789 --> 00:25:32.799 align:start position:0%
obviously House Bill 436 had that kind
 
00:25:36.990 --> 00:25:37.000 align:start position:0%
of scenario where over five budgets $25
 
00:25:42.029 --> 00:25:42.039 align:start position:0%
million was no I'm sorry $50 million 25
 
00:25:44.870 --> 00:25:44.880 align:start position:0%
per year was allocated in each fiscal
 
00:25:48.870 --> 00:25:48.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:52.590 --> 00:25:52.600 align:start position:0%
so I like your uh
 
00:25:52.600 --> 00:25:56.669 align:start position:0%
so I like your uh
ringtone

00:25:56.669 --> 00:25:56.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:02.710 --> 00:26:02.720 align:start position:0%
um it still has the potential issue
 
00:26:06.350 --> 00:26:06.360 align:start position:0%
of a future legislature
 
00:26:10.630 --> 00:26:10.640 align:start position:0%
not being willing or able to fund
 
00:26:13.190 --> 00:26:13.200 align:start position:0%
whatever that commitment might be if we
 
00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:14.669 align:start position:0%
whatever that commitment might be if we
were

00:26:14.669 --> 00:26:14.679 align:start position:0%
were
 
00:26:18.549 --> 00:26:18.559 align:start position:0%
to yep you know take Amendment 2259 for
 
00:26:22.190 --> 00:26:22.200 align:start position:0%
example so it's $58 million and we
 
00:26:25.190 --> 00:26:25.200 align:start position:0%
terminally funded half of that in this
 
00:26:25.200 --> 00:26:26.310 align:start position:0%
terminally funded half of that in this
budget

00:26:26.310 --> 00:26:26.320 align:start position:0%
budget
 
00:26:29.549 --> 00:26:29.559 align:start position:0%
29 then there's still the exposure of
 
00:26:32.630 --> 00:26:32.640 align:start position:0%
what might happen to that $29 million
 
00:26:35.630 --> 00:26:35.640 align:start position:0%
that would be necessary to terminally to
 
00:26:39.149 --> 00:26:39.159 align:start position:0%
fully complete the terminal funding and
 
00:26:42.070 --> 00:26:42.080 align:start position:0%
if it's not all one lump sum again this
 
00:26:44.029 --> 00:26:44.039 align:start position:0%
would be a question for the actuaries
 
00:26:48.510 --> 00:26:48.520 align:start position:0%
probably but would that change the level
 
00:26:51.070 --> 00:26:51.080 align:start position:0%
of terminal funding too a little bit a
 
00:26:54.190 --> 00:26:54.200 align:start position:0%
little bit at least yes yeah
 
00:26:58.669 --> 00:26:58.679 align:start position:0%
so but that would be a way of
 
00:27:01.549 --> 00:27:01.559 align:start position:0%
spreading out the
 
00:27:06.389 --> 00:27:06.399 align:start position:0%
cost Senator gray um we're almost
 
00:27:10.549 --> 00:27:10.559 align:start position:0%
talking like Amendment 2259 or
 
00:27:14.350 --> 00:27:14.360 align:start position:0%
2258 is going to be where we go and
 
00:27:17.750 --> 00:27:17.760 align:start position:0%
that's not where I can go okay uh that
 
00:27:19.190 --> 00:27:19.200 align:start position:0%
those amendments
 
00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:21.470 align:start position:0%
those amendments
affect

00:27:21.470 --> 00:27:21.480 align:start position:0%
affect
 
00:27:21.480 --> 00:27:24.110 align:start position:0%
affect
1,731

00:27:24.110 --> 00:27:24.120 align:start position:0%
1,731
 
00:27:30.350 --> 00:27:30.360 align:start position:0%
people there is 4,9 66 people in tier
 
00:27:32.950 --> 00:27:32.960 align:start position:0%
C they get
 
00:27:32.960 --> 00:27:34.630 align:start position:0%
C they get
nothing

00:27:34.630 --> 00:27:34.640 align:start position:0%
nothing
 
00:27:37.190 --> 00:27:37.200 align:start position:0%
nothing in
 
00:27:41.110 --> 00:27:41.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:47.070 --> 00:27:47.080 align:start position:0%
52,6 45 people in group
 
00:27:49.430 --> 00:27:49.440 align:start position:0%
one they get
 
00:27:51.590 --> 00:27:51.600 align:start position:0%
nothing in
 
00:27:51.600 --> 00:27:56.509 align:start position:0%
nothing in
this

00:27:56.509 --> 00:27:56.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:56.519 --> 00:27:58.269 align:start position:0%
 
nothing

00:27:58.269 --> 00:27:58.279 align:start position:0%
nothing
 
00:28:03.110 --> 00:28:03.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:08.149 --> 00:28:08.159 align:start position:0%
forward everyone in group two get
 
00:28:11.230 --> 00:28:11.240 align:start position:0%
something does tier B get more than
 
00:28:14.830 --> 00:28:14.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:18.750 --> 00:28:18.760 align:start position:0%
really with group one in the proposal
 
00:28:19.830 --> 00:28:19.840 align:start position:0%
that I put
 
00:28:23.470 --> 00:28:23.480 align:start position:0%
forward is it a lot of money can I only
 
00:28:26.430 --> 00:28:26.440 align:start position:0%
affect the ones that are state employees
 
00:28:29.110 --> 00:28:29.120 align:start position:0%
and would the municipal alties have to
 
00:28:32.549 --> 00:28:32.559 align:start position:0%
do something to affect their people yeah
 
00:28:34.070 --> 00:28:34.080 align:start position:0%
but the cost would come back as a
 
00:28:38.070 --> 00:28:38.080 align:start position:0%
negotiated item just like salaries are
 
00:28:38.950 --> 00:28:38.960 align:start position:0%
when you
 
00:28:41.389 --> 00:28:41.399 align:start position:0%
negotiate for fringe
 
00:28:41.399 --> 00:28:43.190 align:start position:0%
negotiate for fringe
benefits

00:28:43.190 --> 00:28:43.200 align:start position:0%
benefits
 
00:28:46.029 --> 00:28:46.039 align:start position:0%
so if I'm going to spend the
 
00:28:48.750 --> 00:28:48.760 align:start position:0%
money I would you know rather have a
 
00:28:51.549 --> 00:28:51.559 align:start position:0%
conversation if if the percentages that
 
00:28:55.470 --> 00:28:55.480 align:start position:0%
I put forward uh weren't high enough or
 
00:28:57.669 --> 00:28:57.679 align:start position:0%
whether they should be in different
 
00:29:01.269 --> 00:29:01.279 align:start position:0%
years instead of raising everyone to
 
00:29:07.389 --> 00:29:07.399 align:start position:0%
2.25 and at 20 years and 25 at 30 years
 
00:29:10.669 --> 00:29:10.679 align:start position:0%
you know bring it down to 2.5 at 25
 
00:29:12.549 --> 00:29:12.559 align:start position:0%
years or
 
00:29:12.559 --> 00:29:14.190 align:start position:0%
years or
whatever

00:29:14.190 --> 00:29:14.200 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
00:29:17.149 --> 00:29:17.159 align:start position:0%
again it's reasonable the cost is
 
00:29:21.310 --> 00:29:21.320 align:start position:0%
something that I think that we can work
 
00:29:27.070 --> 00:29:27.080 align:start position:0%
with um but if we raise those benefits
 
00:29:28.950 --> 00:29:28.960 align:start position:0%
you know you know we are going to have
 
00:29:31.470 --> 00:29:31.480 align:start position:0%
to come up with the money because we
 
00:29:33.789 --> 00:29:33.799 align:start position:0%
can't take them back away after they
 
00:29:33.799 --> 00:29:34.950 align:start position:0%
can't take them back away after they
vested

00:29:34.950 --> 00:29:34.960 align:start position:0%
vested
 
00:29:38.230 --> 00:29:38.240 align:start position:0%
people can't take them back so you got
 
00:29:41.110 --> 00:29:41.120 align:start position:0%
to come up with the money it's just how
 
00:29:44.190 --> 00:29:44.200 align:start position:0%
much pain it is if we fund it
 
00:29:47.470 --> 00:29:47.480 align:start position:0%
incrementally how much pain it is to
 
00:29:49.789 --> 00:29:49.799 align:start position:0%
come up with the rest of the money after
 
00:29:53.310 --> 00:29:53.320 align:start position:0%
we decide what we can afford this time
 
00:29:56.310 --> 00:29:56.320 align:start position:0%
so those are my comments thank
 
00:29:58.909 --> 00:29:58.919 align:start position:0%
you anyone else represent
 
00:30:02.149 --> 00:30:02.159 align:start position:0%
Lan thank you madam chair and I believe
 
00:30:05.789 --> 00:30:05.799 align:start position:0%
this was discussed uh a meeting to back
 
00:30:09.269 --> 00:30:09.279 align:start position:0%
this review of the retirement has become
 
00:30:11.509 --> 00:30:11.519 align:start position:0%
much too broad in my opinion it was
 
00:30:14.909 --> 00:30:14.919 align:start position:0%
initially focused on House Bill
 
00:30:16.830 --> 00:30:16.840 align:start position:0%
436 uh the
 
00:30:19.950 --> 00:30:19.960 align:start position:0%
1700 uh folks that were penalized I
 
00:30:21.350 --> 00:30:21.360 align:start position:0%
believe with the actions that took
 
00:30:24.350 --> 00:30:24.360 align:start position:0%
placed more than a decade ago and I
 
00:30:26.590 --> 00:30:26.600 align:start position:0%
think the more we get out there about
 
00:30:29.509 --> 00:30:29.519 align:start position:0%
different TI years the different uh
 
00:30:31.870 --> 00:30:31.880 align:start position:0%
increases the group one group two we're
 
00:30:34.950 --> 00:30:34.960 align:start position:0%
losing track of what at least the house
 
00:30:38.230 --> 00:30:38.240 align:start position:0%
position was on 436 which got us to a
 
00:30:40.549 --> 00:30:40.559 align:start position:0%
commission in the first place I just
 
00:30:42.389 --> 00:30:42.399 align:start position:0%
would like to say that I think we're
 
00:30:44.430 --> 00:30:44.440 align:start position:0%
really putting a lot more mud into the
 
00:30:46.470 --> 00:30:46.480 align:start position:0%
water than we should and we should
 
00:30:49.389 --> 00:30:49.399 align:start position:0%
really focus on what I thought the
 
00:30:51.070 --> 00:30:51.080 align:start position:0%
commission would really be focusing on
 
00:30:55.750 --> 00:30:55.760 align:start position:0%
and that's a group two tier to 1,700
 
00:30:58.629 --> 00:30:58.639 align:start position:0%
plus retirees are potential retirees
 
00:31:02.629 --> 00:31:02.639 align:start position:0%
that were penalized a decade ago thanks
 
00:31:07.149 --> 00:31:07.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:11.350 --> 00:31:11.360 align:start position:0%
comments Madam chair yes I sometimes the
 
00:31:13.310 --> 00:31:13.320 align:start position:0%
internet is helpful uh and answer to
 
00:31:16.669 --> 00:31:16.679 align:start position:0%
Senator Susie's question um as of the
 
00:31:19.549 --> 00:31:19.559 align:start position:0%
end of fiscal 22 and our those charts
 
00:31:21.230 --> 00:31:21.240 align:start position:0%
were broken down in the the current
 
00:31:23.990 --> 00:31:24.000 align:start position:0%
tiers which is you know 8 to 10 6 to8 so
 
00:31:27.509 --> 00:31:27.519 align:start position:0%
there were 723 group members between six
 
00:31:29.909 --> 00:31:29.919 align:start position:0%
but less than 10 years of service and
 
00:31:33.269 --> 00:31:33.279 align:start position:0%
another 420 who were in The 4 to six
 
00:31:35.629 --> 00:31:35.639 align:start position:0%
range so if you cut that in half you're
 
00:31:39.190 --> 00:31:39.200 align:start position:0%
a little bit over 900 so the
 
00:31:41.269 --> 00:31:41.279 align:start position:0%
folks getting the two and a quarter
 
00:31:42.990 --> 00:31:43.000 align:start position:0%
multiplier is you know somewhat less
 
00:31:46.830 --> 00:31:46.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:46.840 --> 00:31:49.950 align:start position:0%
 
total

00:31:49.950 --> 00:31:49.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:54.430 --> 00:31:54.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:56.629 --> 00:31:56.639 align:start position:0%
real thank you madam chair I just would
 
00:31:57.990 --> 00:31:58.000 align:start position:0%
like to respond respond to Senator
 
00:32:02.190 --> 00:32:02.200 align:start position:0%
Gray's comments um it maybe perception
 
00:32:04.789 --> 00:32:04.799 align:start position:0%
is reality in this case but uh I would
 
00:32:07.190 --> 00:32:07.200 align:start position:0%
like to think that this has gone well
 
00:32:10.669 --> 00:32:10.679 align:start position:0%
beyond restoring a benefit for 1700
 
00:32:13.710 --> 00:32:13.720 align:start position:0%
members and it's become more about
 
00:32:16.350 --> 00:32:16.360 align:start position:0%
public safety for the million and a half
 
00:32:18.990 --> 00:32:19.000 align:start position:0%
citizens in the state of New
 
00:32:23.110 --> 00:32:23.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire state troopers are down 77
 
00:32:25.310 --> 00:32:25.320 align:start position:0%
Troopers the Department of
 
00:32:28.310 --> 00:32:28.320 align:start position:0%
Corrections has been having to use the
 
00:32:30.830 --> 00:32:30.840 align:start position:0%
National Guard to staff their prisons
 
00:32:32.870 --> 00:32:32.880 align:start position:0%
and professional firefighters are losing
 
00:32:34.669 --> 00:32:34.679 align:start position:0%
firefighters at almost a rate of two to
 
00:32:38.110 --> 00:32:38.120 align:start position:0%
one for what we can hire and what we can
 
00:32:41.070 --> 00:32:41.080 align:start position:0%
retain I'm quite frankly tired of
 
00:32:42.909 --> 00:32:42.919 align:start position:0%
hearing about the fact that New
 
00:32:44.269 --> 00:32:44.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is the number one state for
 
00:32:48.710 --> 00:32:48.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:51.789 --> 00:32:51.799 align:start position:0%
not the the the men and women that work
 
00:32:53.629 --> 00:32:53.639 align:start position:0%
in the fire service the Police Service
 
00:32:55.110 --> 00:32:55.120 align:start position:0%
Corrections are some of the bravest
 
00:32:57.789 --> 00:32:57.799 align:start position:0%
people I've ever met and had the the
 
00:33:01.029 --> 00:33:01.039 align:start position:0%
luxury of working with but we have a
 
00:33:02.230 --> 00:33:02.240 align:start position:0%
real problem
 
00:33:04.990 --> 00:33:05.000 align:start position:0%
here and we're losing people in this
 
00:33:07.389 --> 00:33:07.399 align:start position:0%
state and we need to find a way to keep
 
00:33:10.710 --> 00:33:10.720 align:start position:0%
them and I'm sorry Senator gray but a a
 
00:33:13.590 --> 00:33:13.600 align:start position:0%
bill that is has a $15 million price tag
 
00:33:16.909 --> 00:33:16.919 align:start position:0%
is not going to cover the 60,000 people
 
00:33:18.430 --> 00:33:18.440 align:start position:0%
in the entire retirement system that you
 
00:33:23.110 --> 00:33:23.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:26.190 --> 00:33:26.200 align:start position:0%
reasonable on June 7th and 8th Senator
 
00:33:28.269 --> 00:33:28.279 align:start position:0%
Bradley you took the floor and you you
 
00:33:29.950 --> 00:33:29.960 align:start position:0%
gave a word to your colleagues in the
 
00:33:32.350 --> 00:33:32.360 align:start position:0%
Senate and I appreciate you coming here
 
00:33:34.190 --> 00:33:34.200 align:start position:0%
and working on this issue and trying to
 
00:33:36.950 --> 00:33:36.960 align:start position:0%
figure it out we we haven't been able to
 
00:33:38.430 --> 00:33:38.440 align:start position:0%
get there
 
00:33:41.750 --> 00:33:41.760 align:start position:0%
yet but we all listen to you and when I
 
00:33:44.230 --> 00:33:44.240 align:start position:0%
say we all the firefighters the police
 
00:33:45.789 --> 00:33:45.799 align:start position:0%
officers correctional officers in the
 
00:33:47.909 --> 00:33:47.919 align:start position:0%
state sat there and and watched that
 
00:33:51.190 --> 00:33:51.200 align:start position:0%
floor speech and we were instilled with
 
00:33:53.149 --> 00:33:53.159 align:start position:0%
a sense of confidence that this was
 
00:33:54.669 --> 00:33:54.679 align:start position:0%
going to get fixed and it was going to
 
00:33:54.679 --> 00:33:55.430 align:start position:0%
going to get fixed and it was going to
get

00:33:55.430 --> 00:33:55.440 align:start position:0%
get
 
00:34:00.230 --> 00:34:00.240 align:start position:0%
done you gave your word to fix this
 
00:34:02.549 --> 00:34:02.559 align:start position:0%
issue and you said we would watch
 
00:34:05.230 --> 00:34:05.240 align:start position:0%
revenues throughout the summer and into
 
00:34:07.549 --> 00:34:07.559 align:start position:0%
the early fall to see what those
 
00:34:07.559 --> 00:34:08.750 align:start position:0%
the early fall to see what those
revenues

00:34:08.750 --> 00:34:08.760 align:start position:0%
revenues
 
00:34:11.349 --> 00:34:11.359 align:start position:0%
did those revenues have been have
 
00:34:14.710 --> 00:34:14.720 align:start position:0%
surpassed what we needed them to
 
00:34:17.430 --> 00:34:17.440 align:start position:0%
be yet we continue to sit here and talk
 
00:34:19.550 --> 00:34:19.560 align:start position:0%
about uh the fact that we're not going
 
00:34:23.310 --> 00:34:23.320 align:start position:0%
to fund this in its entirety and I would
 
00:34:26.030 --> 00:34:26.040 align:start position:0%
ask that this commission take a long
 
00:34:28.230 --> 00:34:28.240 align:start position:0%
hard look at what the ramifications of
 
00:34:31.389 --> 00:34:31.399 align:start position:0%
not dealing with this issue now will be
 
00:34:34.550 --> 00:34:34.560 align:start position:0%
and I fear that it's going to result in
 
00:34:37.310 --> 00:34:37.320 align:start position:0%
tragedy for the citizens of the state
 
00:34:38.950 --> 00:34:38.960 align:start position:0%
and I don't think any of us want to have
 
00:34:41.589 --> 00:34:41.599 align:start position:0%
to answer to that I would ask that we
 
00:34:44.470 --> 00:34:44.480 align:start position:0%
please look at what revenues have done
 
00:34:46.190 --> 00:34:46.200 align:start position:0%
stay true to what we said that we were
 
00:34:48.550 --> 00:34:48.560 align:start position:0%
going to do and fix this issue once and
 
00:34:55.869 --> 00:34:55.879 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:55.879 --> 00:34:58.349 align:start position:0%
 
you

00:34:58.349 --> 00:34:58.359 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:35:02.710 --> 00:35:02.720 align:start position:0%
thank you Senator so
 
00:35:07.870 --> 00:35:07.880 align:start position:0%
um I appreciate the um comments
 
00:35:12.270 --> 00:35:12.280 align:start position:0%
of Brian's um I think we have looked at
 
00:35:15.190 --> 00:35:15.200 align:start position:0%
revenues July and August
 
00:35:19.950 --> 00:35:19.960 align:start position:0%
were um slightly below expectations the
 
00:35:22.150 --> 00:35:22.160 align:start position:0%
plan in the combination of the two
 
00:35:24.349 --> 00:35:24.359 align:start position:0%
months September was good no question
 
00:35:30.270 --> 00:35:30.280 align:start position:0%
about that um but as I said you know
 
00:35:32.829 --> 00:35:32.839 align:start position:0%
when a budget is put together you have
 
00:35:35.589 --> 00:35:35.599 align:start position:0%
expected revenues and then
 
00:35:39.470 --> 00:35:39.480 align:start position:0%
Appropriations based on those revenues
 
00:35:43.270 --> 00:35:43.280 align:start position:0%
so we are that $36 million ahead but
 
00:35:45.109 --> 00:35:45.119 align:start position:0%
we're not running the same kind of
 
00:35:48.030 --> 00:35:48.040 align:start position:0%
surpluses that we did in the prior
 
00:35:51.630 --> 00:35:51.640 align:start position:0%
budget which is when I said on the floor
 
00:35:54.589 --> 00:35:54.599 align:start position:0%
that we had to look at you know those
 
00:35:57.910 --> 00:35:57.920 align:start position:0%
revenues that was
 
00:36:00.550 --> 00:36:00.560 align:start position:0%
what I was referring to the if we
 
00:36:02.309 --> 00:36:02.319 align:start position:0%
continue to
 
00:36:05.349 --> 00:36:05.359 align:start position:0%
generate those kind of surpluses this
 
00:36:05.359 --> 00:36:07.470 align:start position:0%
generate those kind of surpluses this
becomes

00:36:07.470 --> 00:36:07.480 align:start position:0%
becomes
 
00:36:10.670 --> 00:36:10.680 align:start position:0%
easier but so far two of the three
 
00:36:13.430 --> 00:36:13.440 align:start position:0%
months barely made expectations and the
 
00:36:18.349 --> 00:36:18.359 align:start position:0%
third was good so it it is a small
 
00:36:21.470 --> 00:36:21.480 align:start position:0%
snapshot we are the 36 million doll
 
00:36:25.829 --> 00:36:25.839 align:start position:0%
ahead of expectations that's good but
 
00:36:28.710 --> 00:36:28.720 align:start position:0%
the price tag we didn't know then what
 
00:36:32.309 --> 00:36:32.319 align:start position:0%
the price tag was going to be um and
 
00:36:34.550 --> 00:36:34.560 align:start position:0%
that was part of the the problem we
 
00:36:37.349 --> 00:36:37.359 align:start position:0%
didn't have time to have an Actuarial
 
00:36:40.430 --> 00:36:40.440 align:start position:0%
analysis done of just doing the
 
00:36:44.910 --> 00:36:44.920 align:start position:0%
multiplier we ran out of time and it had
 
00:36:47.109 --> 00:36:47.119 align:start position:0%
been my hope that we would continue to
 
00:36:50.109 --> 00:36:50.119 align:start position:0%
generate the same kind of surpluses so I
 
00:36:52.190 --> 00:36:52.200 align:start position:0%
don't think we have generated the same
 
00:36:54.230 --> 00:36:54.240 align:start position:0%
kind of surpluses because virtually
 
00:36:57.750 --> 00:36:57.760 align:start position:0%
every month um in the prior f Year we're
 
00:37:00.710 --> 00:37:00.720 align:start position:0%
running pretty hefty surpluses now some
 
00:37:03.230 --> 00:37:03.240 align:start position:0%
months are bigger than others like May
 
00:37:06.069 --> 00:37:06.079 align:start position:0%
is not a very big month because not much
 
00:37:08.589 --> 00:37:08.599 align:start position:0%
revenue is due September is a big month
 
00:37:10.670 --> 00:37:10.680 align:start position:0%
so that's good that's that's good and
 
00:37:14.190 --> 00:37:14.200 align:start position:0%
October's a fairly substantial month too
 
00:37:19.750 --> 00:37:19.760 align:start position:0%
November is not December is um we will
 
00:37:23.190 --> 00:37:23.200 align:start position:0%
have a much better snapshot
 
00:37:27.430 --> 00:37:27.440 align:start position:0%
having um seen what October
 
00:37:30.309 --> 00:37:30.319 align:start position:0%
and yes November and December look like
 
00:37:33.790 --> 00:37:33.800 align:start position:0%
in terms of because you know if we were
 
00:37:37.670 --> 00:37:37.680 align:start position:0%
50 or6 million ahead right now I'd feel
 
00:37:40.230 --> 00:37:40.240 align:start position:0%
a lot more confident that we were going
 
00:37:41.910 --> 00:37:41.920 align:start position:0%
to continue to generate the kind of
 
00:37:45.150 --> 00:37:45.160 align:start position:0%
surpluses but things you know have a way
 
00:37:48.510 --> 00:37:48.520 align:start position:0%
of changing
 
00:37:53.829 --> 00:37:53.839 align:start position:0%
and the uncertainty of Revenue is um
 
00:37:56.750 --> 00:37:56.760 align:start position:0%
something that I think is building more
 
00:37:59.190 --> 00:37:59.200 align:start position:0%
than I would have expected when I said
 
00:38:03.270 --> 00:38:03.280 align:start position:0%
that in June so that's the unfortunate
 
00:38:07.349 --> 00:38:07.359 align:start position:0%
reality of the situation in terms of
 
00:38:09.990 --> 00:38:10.000 align:start position:0%
Revenue but again I guess I would
 
00:38:12.470 --> 00:38:12.480 align:start position:0%
challenge all of us and I've made a
 
00:38:14.829 --> 00:38:14.839 align:start position:0%
couple of suggestions obviously with my
 
00:38:17.670 --> 00:38:17.680 align:start position:0%
two amendments to try to find ways to
 
00:38:20.550 --> 00:38:20.560 align:start position:0%
move forward but
 
00:38:23.550 --> 00:38:23.560 align:start position:0%
um you know keep the cost down and I
 
00:38:25.069 --> 00:38:25.079 align:start position:0%
appreciate that that's what you're
 
00:38:27.190 --> 00:38:27.200 align:start position:0%
trying to do
 
00:38:30.069 --> 00:38:30.079 align:start position:0%
and um if
 
00:38:33.349 --> 00:38:33.359 align:start position:0%
we analyze the impact on the Second
 
00:38:36.710 --> 00:38:36.720 align:start position:0%
Amendment and um you know so I think if
 
00:38:38.589 --> 00:38:38.599 align:start position:0%
this committee were to authorize that
 
00:38:42.069 --> 00:38:42.079 align:start position:0%
then myself and the speaker could move
 
00:38:45.750 --> 00:38:45.760 align:start position:0%
ahead because we can authorize the
 
00:38:48.109 --> 00:38:48.119 align:start position:0%
expenditure of the funds for GRS to do
 
00:38:51.910 --> 00:38:51.920 align:start position:0%
that and it's probably I mean my guess
 
00:38:53.670 --> 00:38:53.680 align:start position:0%
is it's going to be somewhat less than
 
00:38:54.910 --> 00:38:54.920 align:start position:0%
the $14
 
00:38:57.069 --> 00:38:57.079 align:start position:0%
million um but that that would be
 
00:38:59.550 --> 00:38:59.560 align:start position:0%
helpful and if there are other ways that
 
00:39:02.750 --> 00:39:02.760 align:start position:0%
we can get the price tag down but still
 
00:39:05.790 --> 00:39:05.800 align:start position:0%
accomplish the goal I think given the
 
00:39:08.430 --> 00:39:08.440 align:start position:0%
that the revenue picture at least for
 
00:39:10.349 --> 00:39:10.359 align:start position:0%
the first three months snapshot has
 
00:39:13.710 --> 00:39:13.720 align:start position:0%
changed somewhat from the very flush
 
00:39:13.720 --> 00:39:14.589 align:start position:0%
changed somewhat from the very flush
days

00:39:14.589 --> 00:39:14.599 align:start position:0%
days
 
00:39:18.309 --> 00:39:18.319 align:start position:0%
of um you know the last budget where
 
00:39:19.470 --> 00:39:19.480 align:start position:0%
there were a couple of months that we
 
00:39:21.790 --> 00:39:21.800 align:start position:0%
ran $100 million
 
00:39:25.270 --> 00:39:25.280 align:start position:0%
surpluses I don't have all of those um
 
00:39:28.069 --> 00:39:28.079 align:start position:0%
numbers here in front of me but I mean
 
00:39:30.829 --> 00:39:30.839 align:start position:0%
that's why we're able to do a lot of the
 
00:39:32.349 --> 00:39:32.359 align:start position:0%
things that we did in the
 
00:39:37.150 --> 00:39:37.160 align:start position:0%
budget so the position we're in is that
 
00:39:41.230 --> 00:39:41.240 align:start position:0%
we have a an amendment with a suggested
 
00:39:43.309 --> 00:39:43.319 align:start position:0%
modification that will reduce the
 
00:39:47.030 --> 00:39:47.040 align:start position:0%
expense by some amount does anyone have
 
00:39:50.470 --> 00:39:50.480 align:start position:0%
any other suggestions that would lower
 
00:39:53.430 --> 00:39:53.440 align:start position:0%
the cost while maintaining the intent of
 
00:39:53.440 --> 00:39:53.630 align:start position:0%
the cost while maintaining the intent of
that

00:39:53.630 --> 00:39:53.640 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:39:53.640 --> 00:39:55.390 align:start position:0%
that

Amendment
 
00:39:57.359 --> 00:39:58.750 align:start position:0%
Amendment
Mr

00:39:58.750 --> 00:39:58.760 align:start position:0%
Mr
 
00:40:01.470 --> 00:40:01.480 align:start position:0%
R um I don't necessarily have a
 
00:40:04.190 --> 00:40:04.200 align:start position:0%
recommendation but if I could speak to
 
00:40:07.190 --> 00:40:07.200 align:start position:0%
what's being discussed I'd like
 
00:40:12.230 --> 00:40:12.240 align:start position:0%
to briefly please do okay um I have some
 
00:40:15.470 --> 00:40:15.480 align:start position:0%
concerns over the Second Amendment um I
 
00:40:18.190 --> 00:40:18.200 align:start position:0%
just want to state that now before we
 
00:40:21.390 --> 00:40:21.400 align:start position:0%
spend the money to have GRS do their uh
 
00:40:23.309 --> 00:40:23.319 align:start position:0%
analysis of this and and all
 
00:40:25.510 --> 00:40:25.520 align:start position:0%
transparency I'm trying to be fiscally
 
00:40:29.430 --> 00:40:29.440 align:start position:0%
responsible myself here um but I do
 
00:40:30.910 --> 00:40:30.920 align:start position:0%
believe that there
 
00:40:34.550 --> 00:40:34.560 align:start position:0%
is a uh line of demarcation somewhere
 
00:40:36.910 --> 00:40:36.920 align:start position:0%
that we we have to
 
00:40:40.470 --> 00:40:40.480 align:start position:0%
identify uh to which we cannot fall
 
00:40:43.550 --> 00:40:43.560 align:start position:0%
below um when we're talking about what
 
00:40:45.030 --> 00:40:45.040 align:start position:0%
the benefit is that we're looking to
 
00:40:47.430 --> 00:40:47.440 align:start position:0%
provide um I can tell you firefighters
 
00:40:50.109 --> 00:40:50.119 align:start position:0%
in the state um probably will not be
 
00:40:54.150 --> 00:40:54.160 align:start position:0%
happy um with the Second Amendment um
 
00:40:57.069 --> 00:40:57.079 align:start position:0%
that we're discussing right now 22 2 58
 
00:41:00.150 --> 00:41:00.160 align:start position:0%
uh excuse me 59 I believe it is um so I
 
00:41:03.430 --> 00:41:03.440 align:start position:0%
would want to State on record that um I
 
00:41:05.750 --> 00:41:05.760 align:start position:0%
would support obviously
 
00:41:09.510 --> 00:41:09.520 align:start position:0%
2258 um and continue to look for uh
 
00:41:13.109 --> 00:41:13.119 align:start position:0%
revenue for the next month or two to see
 
00:41:18.109 --> 00:41:18.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:20.470 --> 00:41:20.480 align:start position:0%
you thank you that's very valuable
 
00:41:23.030 --> 00:41:23.040 align:start position:0%
information that the other Amendment
 
00:41:26.670 --> 00:41:26.680 align:start position:0%
might not be totally acceptable
 
00:41:28.990 --> 00:41:29.000 align:start position:0%
representative wilham you had a comment
 
00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:31.109 align:start position:0%
representative wilham you had a comment
no

00:41:31.109 --> 00:41:31.119 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:41:34.510 --> 00:41:34.520 align:start position:0%
okay Senator gray U Madam chair I'd like
 
00:41:37.829 --> 00:41:37.839 align:start position:0%
to to at least comment on some of the uh
 
00:41:41.230 --> 00:41:41.240 align:start position:0%
concerns that people uh expressed over
 
00:41:41.240 --> 00:41:42.349 align:start position:0%
concerns that people uh expressed over
my

00:41:42.349 --> 00:41:42.359 align:start position:0%
my
 
00:41:45.790 --> 00:41:45.800 align:start position:0%
remarks um the duties of this commission
 
00:41:48.510 --> 00:41:48.520 align:start position:0%
are not based on the house bill they are
 
00:41:51.349 --> 00:41:51.359 align:start position:0%
based on the language that was put into
 
00:41:55.150 --> 00:41:55.160 align:start position:0%
uh House Bill 2 uh which is chapter 79
 
00:41:57.190 --> 00:41:57.200 align:start position:0%
page 18 and
 
00:41:59.390 --> 00:41:59.400 align:start position:0%
19 uh and
 
00:42:02.750 --> 00:42:02.760 align:start position:0%
talk nothing about the original House
 
00:42:06.230 --> 00:42:06.240 align:start position:0%
bill that was issued uh and the first
 
00:42:11.190 --> 00:42:11.200 align:start position:0%
one on uh line 28 and 29 says the we're
 
00:42:12.750 --> 00:42:12.760 align:start position:0%
supposed to be studying the impact of
 
00:42:14.309 --> 00:42:14.319 align:start position:0%
the retirement system will have on the
 
00:42:16.710 --> 00:42:16.720 align:start position:0%
retention of employees and the ability
 
00:42:19.829 --> 00:42:19.839 align:start position:0%
to attract new
 
00:42:22.150 --> 00:42:22.160 align:start position:0%
employees and that's what I talked about
 
00:42:24.430 --> 00:42:24.440 align:start position:0%
before is attracting those new
 
00:42:28.030 --> 00:42:28.040 align:start position:0%
employees if I only concentrate on tier
 
00:42:31.950 --> 00:42:31.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:34.750 --> 00:42:34.760 align:start position:0%
C then how am I affecting the new
 
00:42:37.829 --> 00:42:37.839 align:start position:0%
employees how am I going to provide a
 
00:42:41.630 --> 00:42:41.640 align:start position:0%
safe condition for the citizens in the
 
00:42:43.630 --> 00:42:43.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire in the
 
00:42:47.270 --> 00:42:47.280 align:start position:0%
future what we've done in part of
 
00:42:50.870 --> 00:42:50.880 align:start position:0%
this in changing the retirement age back
 
00:42:53.549 --> 00:42:53.559 align:start position:0%
is we made it easier for those long-term
 
00:42:58.349 --> 00:42:58.359 align:start position:0%
employees to retire at a higher
 
00:43:02.710 --> 00:43:02.720 align:start position:0%
rate we' have negatively impacted the
 
00:43:05.510 --> 00:43:05.520 align:start position:0%
safety of the Hampshire citizens by
 
00:43:05.520 --> 00:43:08.309 align:start position:0%
safety of the Hampshire citizens by
doing

00:43:08.309 --> 00:43:08.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:13.670 --> 00:43:13.680 align:start position:0%
that so I'm very confused you know this
 
00:43:16.549 --> 00:43:16.559 align:start position:0%
this commission is more like a
 
00:43:19.630 --> 00:43:19.640 align:start position:0%
negotiation session with the group two
 
00:43:22.309 --> 00:43:22.319 align:start position:0%
people than it is looking at the whole
 
00:43:25.750 --> 00:43:25.760 align:start position:0%
retirement system which is what house
 
00:43:28.910 --> 00:43:28.920 align:start position:0%
fil to says we're supposed to be
 
00:43:32.109 --> 00:43:32.119 align:start position:0%
doing thank you madam
 
00:43:34.630 --> 00:43:34.640 align:start position:0%
CH thank you madam chair um you know I
 
00:43:36.390 --> 00:43:36.400 align:start position:0%
really appreciate my my colleague
 
00:43:38.910 --> 00:43:38.920 align:start position:0%
Senator Gray's concern about the the big
 
00:43:42.790 --> 00:43:42.800 align:start position:0%
picture and um I certainly have not felt
 
00:43:46.829 --> 00:43:46.839 align:start position:0%
that the focus on the one issue that you
 
00:43:49.589 --> 00:43:49.599 align:start position:0%
know might develop a consensus Bill and
 
00:43:51.630 --> 00:43:51.640 align:start position:0%
look at some terminal funding is not
 
00:43:54.390 --> 00:43:54.400 align:start position:0%
meant to preclude whatsoever um
 
00:43:55.670 --> 00:43:55.680 align:start position:0%
recommendations that might come out of
 
00:43:58.549 --> 00:43:58.559 align:start position:0%
this Commission for legislation to to
 
00:43:59.910 --> 00:43:59.920 align:start position:0%
address some of these larger issues
 
00:44:01.069 --> 00:44:01.079 align:start position:0%
because I I agree completely with
 
00:44:03.069 --> 00:44:03.079 align:start position:0%
Senator gray that we have to really
 
00:44:05.710 --> 00:44:05.720 align:start position:0%
think about and what we've heard about
 
00:44:07.870 --> 00:44:07.880 align:start position:0%
you know Recruitment and uh and
 
00:44:09.990 --> 00:44:10.000 align:start position:0%
retention that there's a lot of issues
 
00:44:11.270 --> 00:44:11.280 align:start position:0%
here and we can't wait to the next
 
00:44:13.470 --> 00:44:13.480 align:start position:0%
decennial pension commission so I would
 
00:44:16.470 --> 00:44:16.480 align:start position:0%
hope that you know as we have you know
 
00:44:18.069 --> 00:44:18.079 align:start position:0%
if we can reach some kind of consensus
 
00:44:20.510 --> 00:44:20.520 align:start position:0%
at some point in time over the immediate
 
00:44:21.950 --> 00:44:21.960 align:start position:0%
issue that the Amendments that we've
 
00:44:24.030 --> 00:44:24.040 align:start position:0%
been discussing and the actuary work
 
00:44:27.109 --> 00:44:27.119 align:start position:0%
that we have done that then um we really
 
00:44:30.630 --> 00:44:30.640 align:start position:0%
will be I I would hope um able to to
 
00:44:32.150 --> 00:44:32.160 align:start position:0%
look more seriously at some of the
 
00:44:34.069 --> 00:44:34.079 align:start position:0%
things that um Senator gray and others
 
00:44:35.829 --> 00:44:35.839 align:start position:0%
want to propose about these other issues
 
00:44:38.430 --> 00:44:38.440 align:start position:0%
because I agree the language there says
 
00:44:41.230 --> 00:44:41.240 align:start position:0%
that uh we are you know we should look
 
00:44:43.750 --> 00:44:43.760 align:start position:0%
at a broad range of of issues so I would
 
00:44:45.430 --> 00:44:45.440 align:start position:0%
I would hate to think that you know that
 
00:44:47.589 --> 00:44:47.599 align:start position:0%
we're really kind of foreclosing or
 
00:44:49.349 --> 00:44:49.359 align:start position:0%
precluding that larger discussion
 
00:44:50.990 --> 00:44:51.000 align:start position:0%
because we've already had some too we we
 
00:44:54.069 --> 00:44:54.079 align:start position:0%
developed some good ideas that uh that
 
00:44:56.230 --> 00:44:56.240 align:start position:0%
we brought forward and at some point we
 
00:44:58.190 --> 00:44:58.200 align:start position:0%
might make some other recommendations as
 
00:45:01.150 --> 00:45:01.160 align:start position:0%
well thank you madam chair yes I'd like
 
00:45:05.150 --> 00:45:05.160 align:start position:0%
to say that um from the beginning I've
 
00:45:08.430 --> 00:45:08.440 align:start position:0%
seen the the Committees work as having a
 
00:45:12.030 --> 00:45:12.040 align:start position:0%
shortterm issue of something that
 
00:45:16.230 --> 00:45:16.240 align:start position:0%
was started this past year relative to
 
00:45:19.670 --> 00:45:19.680 align:start position:0%
the Gap group of of of group two and
 
00:45:23.150 --> 00:45:23.160 align:start position:0%
also as Senator Ray pointed out we've
 
00:45:25.309 --> 00:45:25.319 align:start position:0%
got to we also need to look at the
 
00:45:27.829 --> 00:45:27.839 align:start position:0%
overall retirement system and see if if
 
00:45:30.069 --> 00:45:30.079 align:start position:0%
it needs changes and we've done a bit of
 
00:45:33.270 --> 00:45:33.280 align:start position:0%
brainstorming on that we haven't had
 
00:45:35.589 --> 00:45:35.599 align:start position:0%
very much in the way
 
00:45:38.750 --> 00:45:38.760 align:start position:0%
of significant proposals to
 
00:45:42.030 --> 00:45:42.040 align:start position:0%
endorse but there have been Senator gra
 
00:45:44.349 --> 00:45:44.359 align:start position:0%
made a couple
 
00:45:44.359 --> 00:45:47.510 align:start position:0%
made a couple
um

00:45:47.510 --> 00:45:47.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:50.190 --> 00:45:50.200 align:start position:0%
so at the moment the question is should
 
00:45:53.349 --> 00:45:53.359 align:start position:0%
we continue brainstorming should we ask
 
00:45:53.359 --> 00:45:54.349 align:start position:0%
we continue brainstorming should we ask
for

00:45:54.349 --> 00:45:54.359 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:45:58.790 --> 00:45:58.800 align:start position:0%
a um Actuarial analysis and pay for it
 
00:46:00.910 --> 00:46:00.920 align:start position:0%
on a proposal that may or may not be
 
00:46:04.190 --> 00:46:04.200 align:start position:0%
satisfactory to everybody
 
00:46:10.190 --> 00:46:10.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:13.349 --> 00:46:13.359 align:start position:0%
to ask the commission to vote on whether
 
00:46:14.750 --> 00:46:14.760 align:start position:0%
or not we
 
00:46:18.950 --> 00:46:18.960 align:start position:0%
should ask for a Actuarial analysis of
 
00:46:18.960 --> 00:46:21.430 align:start position:0%
should ask for a Actuarial analysis of
the

00:46:21.430 --> 00:46:21.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:26.470 --> 00:46:26.480 align:start position:0%
tiered uh increase for group two we the
 
00:46:30.790 --> 00:46:30.800 align:start position:0%
alterations recommended by Mr R so moved
 
00:46:32.990 --> 00:46:33.000 align:start position:0%
okay is there a
 
00:46:35.870 --> 00:46:35.880 align:start position:0%
second does any everybody understand the
 
00:46:40.630 --> 00:46:40.640 align:start position:0%
idea the question no okay I see that uh
 
00:46:44.190 --> 00:46:44.200 align:start position:0%
the the qu that would
 
00:46:48.069 --> 00:46:48.079 align:start position:0%
be Senator Bradley's Amendment
 
00:46:52.870 --> 00:46:52.880 align:start position:0%
2258 I believe 59 sorry
 
00:46:57.549 --> 00:46:57.559 align:start position:0%
2259 which has a the multiplier change
 
00:47:00.349 --> 00:47:00.359 align:start position:0%
and we've already costed that as
 
00:47:07.390 --> 00:47:07.400 align:start position:0%
is plus the change recommended by Mr R
 
00:47:11.390 --> 00:47:11.400 align:start position:0%
for uh people that leave prior to
 
00:47:16.470 --> 00:47:16.480 align:start position:0%
their full date of service or full um
 
00:47:19.790 --> 00:47:19.800 align:start position:0%
full age I'll second that Amendment I'll
 
00:47:22.030 --> 00:47:22.040 align:start position:0%
second that motion okay thank you is
 
00:47:24.470 --> 00:47:24.480 align:start position:0%
that does that uh characterize it
 
00:47:27.309 --> 00:47:27.319 align:start position:0%
properly please
 
00:47:31.030 --> 00:47:31.040 align:start position:0%
please uh I will I'll support this just
 
00:47:33.190 --> 00:47:33.200 align:start position:0%
based on the fact that more information
 
00:47:36.750 --> 00:47:36.760 align:start position:0%
is obviously better than less um again
 
00:47:39.510 --> 00:47:39.520 align:start position:0%
with the assumption that very likely um
 
00:47:41.270 --> 00:47:41.280 align:start position:0%
I wouldn't be able to support this
 
00:47:44.470 --> 00:47:44.480 align:start position:0%
moving forward anything less than uh
 
00:47:44.480 --> 00:47:46.150 align:start position:0%
moving forward anything less than uh
2258

00:47:46.150 --> 00:47:46.160 align:start position:0%
2258
 
00:47:52.190 --> 00:47:52.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:54.710 --> 00:47:54.720 align:start position:0%
okay all right does does everybody
 
00:47:57.510 --> 00:47:57.520 align:start position:0%
understand the question again and Mr
 
00:48:00.670 --> 00:48:00.680 align:start position:0%
Ford uh how much does an analysis like
 
00:48:04.950 --> 00:48:04.960 align:start position:0%
that cost um less than 10,000 I
 
00:48:07.870 --> 00:48:07.880 align:start position:0%
believe and it will be covered by the
 
00:48:10.910 --> 00:48:10.920 align:start position:0%
legislator thank you I think Marty said
 
00:48:14.390 --> 00:48:14.400 align:start position:0%
the two analysis that we've done so far
 
00:48:19.710 --> 00:48:19.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:23.309 --> 00:48:23.319 align:start position:0%
$7,500 that was the range gave us okay
 
00:48:27.790 --> 00:48:27.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:27.800 --> 00:48:30.150 align:start position:0%
 
one

00:48:30.150 --> 00:48:30.160 align:start position:0%
one
 
00:48:33.030 --> 00:48:33.040 align:start position:0%
well they'll if it's this one will be
 
00:48:34.870 --> 00:48:34.880 align:start position:0%
more complicated than some because
 
00:48:36.990 --> 00:48:37.000 align:start position:0%
they've got to estimate how many people
 
00:48:38.870 --> 00:48:38.880 align:start position:0%
will retire at different ages because it
 
00:48:39.750 --> 00:48:39.760 align:start position:0%
makes a
 
00:48:39.760 --> 00:48:41.430 align:start position:0%
makes a
difference

00:48:41.430 --> 00:48:41.440 align:start position:0%
difference
 
00:48:47.150 --> 00:48:47.160 align:start position:0%
okay so so the the motion is to request
 
00:48:47.160 --> 00:48:48.030 align:start position:0%
okay so so the the motion is to request
the

00:48:48.030 --> 00:48:48.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:48:50.270 --> 00:48:50.280 align:start position:0%
analysis uh those in
 
00:48:50.280 --> 00:48:52.390 align:start position:0%
analysis uh those in
favor

00:48:52.390 --> 00:48:52.400 align:start position:0%
favor
 
00:48:54.589 --> 00:48:54.599 align:start position:0%
I any
 
00:48:54.599 --> 00:48:56.750 align:start position:0%
I any
opposed

00:48:56.750 --> 00:48:56.760 align:start position:0%
opposed
 
00:48:58.870 --> 00:48:58.880 align:start position:0%
all right I don't see any opposed but
 
00:49:01.829 --> 00:49:01.839 align:start position:0%
there's a couple of abstentions so Mr
 
00:49:04.990 --> 00:49:05.000 align:start position:0%
Carlin please go ahead and request that
 
00:49:08.829 --> 00:49:08.839 align:start position:0%
analysis Senator gray um I'd like to
 
00:49:11.950 --> 00:49:11.960 align:start position:0%
talk about having another analysis done
 
00:49:15.270 --> 00:49:15.280 align:start position:0%
and that is on my proposal at the
 
00:49:16.710 --> 00:49:16.720 align:start position:0%
bringing it to
 
00:49:22.950 --> 00:49:22.960 align:start position:0%
2.25 at 20 years and 2.5 at 30 years is
 
00:49:26.390 --> 00:49:26.400 align:start position:0%
what it would cost to bring it to 2.5
 
00:49:33.990 --> 00:49:34.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:37.349 --> 00:49:37.359 align:start position:0%
years and get that analysis done which
 
00:49:40.030 --> 00:49:40.040 align:start position:0%
would significantly raise the $12
 
00:49:43.390 --> 00:49:43.400 align:start position:0%
million which was alluded to in one of
 
00:49:44.910 --> 00:49:44.920 align:start position:0%
the other statement excuse me Senator
 
00:49:46.990 --> 00:49:47.000 align:start position:0%
could you you say
 
00:49:51.230 --> 00:49:51.240 align:start position:0%
raise from what to 2.5 in the
 
00:49:54.510 --> 00:49:54.520 align:start position:0%
proposals on sheet
 
00:49:54.520 --> 00:49:56.510 align:start position:0%
proposals on sheet
two

00:49:56.510 --> 00:49:56.520 align:start position:0%
two
 
00:50:00.630 --> 00:50:00.640 align:start position:0%
um at the top of the page it says uh to
 
00:50:01.710 --> 00:50:01.720 align:start position:0%
increase the
 
00:50:04.789 --> 00:50:04.799 align:start position:0%
multiplier uh by 2.5 for the group two
 
00:50:09.430 --> 00:50:09.440 align:start position:0%
members at 20 years and then increase It
 
00:50:12.910 --> 00:50:12.920 align:start position:0%
Again by 2.25 to get to
 
00:50:14.990 --> 00:50:15.000 align:start position:0%
2.5 or
 
00:50:20.510 --> 00:50:20.520 align:start position:0%
0.25 to get to 2.5 at 30 years uh from
 
00:50:23.390 --> 00:50:23.400 align:start position:0%
the multipliers that are currently in
 
00:50:27.270 --> 00:50:27.280 align:start position:0%
statute right okay so your so that would
 
00:50:29.990 --> 00:50:30.000 align:start position:0%
be that all the
 
00:50:33.710 --> 00:50:33.720 align:start position:0%
employees would be at
 
00:50:37.390 --> 00:50:37.400 align:start position:0%
2.25 for every year service starting at
 
00:50:40.190 --> 00:50:40.200 align:start position:0%
20 years would be the thing that you'd
 
00:50:43.630 --> 00:50:43.640 align:start position:0%
be analyzing and again that would affect
 
00:50:45.670 --> 00:50:45.680 align:start position:0%
would not be retroactive because this
 
00:50:47.589 --> 00:50:47.599 align:start position:0%
proposal here wasn't
 
00:50:50.030 --> 00:50:50.040 align:start position:0%
retroactive retroactive and it would
 
00:50:55.630 --> 00:50:55.640 align:start position:0%
give you a uh a much higher number if
 
00:50:58.710 --> 00:50:58.720 align:start position:0%
that's you know what is being sought by
 
00:51:02.789 --> 00:51:02.799 align:start position:0%
uh some uh for uh for the retirement but
 
00:51:07.190 --> 00:51:07.200 align:start position:0%
it would affect tier B and tier C in
 
00:51:08.630 --> 00:51:08.640 align:start position:0%
group two
 
00:51:11.109 --> 00:51:11.119 align:start position:0%
employees okay
 
00:51:14.710 --> 00:51:14.720 align:start position:0%
so to recap you're saying that every
 
00:51:17.470 --> 00:51:17.480 align:start position:0%
group two person in either group in
 
00:51:21.190 --> 00:51:21.200 align:start position:0%
either tier B or C who lasted to 20
 
00:51:23.510 --> 00:51:23.520 align:start position:0%
years would have their multiplier
 
00:51:27.430 --> 00:51:27.440 align:start position:0%
increased to 2.25 at 20 years or the
 
00:51:30.710 --> 00:51:30.720 align:start position:0%
effective date of the change right when
 
00:51:33.069 --> 00:51:33.079 align:start position:0%
it would for those people in tier B
 
00:51:36.349 --> 00:51:36.359 align:start position:0%
right now again not retroactive well
 
00:51:40.030 --> 00:51:40.040 align:start position:0%
they're all in they would be at two uh
 
00:51:43.150 --> 00:51:43.160 align:start position:0%
one two two 2 three into four yes so
 
00:51:45.710 --> 00:51:45.720 align:start position:0%
they would at 20 years they would all
 
00:51:47.750 --> 00:51:47.760 align:start position:0%
which they would all be in right now
 
00:51:50.910 --> 00:51:50.920 align:start position:0%
they would all go to uh 25 for the
 
00:51:53.349 --> 00:51:53.359 align:start position:0%
remainder of their service so 25 after
 
00:51:58.309 --> 00:51:58.319 align:start position:0%
how many years 20 but again it's I'm not
 
00:52:00.230 --> 00:52:00.240 align:start position:0%
trying to make it retroactive so any
 
00:52:03.150 --> 00:52:03.160 align:start position:0%
employee who is not at 20 years would go
 
00:52:06.789 --> 00:52:06.799 align:start position:0%
to 25 at their 20 year anniversary
 
00:52:06.799 --> 00:52:07.789 align:start position:0%
to 25 at their 20 year anniversary
everyone

00:52:07.789 --> 00:52:07.799 align:start position:0%
everyone
 
00:52:10.829 --> 00:52:10.839 align:start position:0%
else as of the passage of the bill would
 
00:52:15.470 --> 00:52:15.480 align:start position:0%
go to 25 for the remainder of their
 
00:52:18.589 --> 00:52:18.599 align:start position:0%
service or if someone else wants to have
 
00:52:22.789 --> 00:52:22.799 align:start position:0%
it analyzed differently I'm um Senator
 
00:52:25.510 --> 00:52:25.520 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm sure you understand what you're
 
00:52:27.430 --> 00:52:27.440 align:start position:0%
asking for but I'm afraid it doesn't
 
00:52:31.150 --> 00:52:31.160 align:start position:0%
make sense to me Senator Bradley you
 
00:52:34.309 --> 00:52:34.319 align:start position:0%
this is a question of Marty uh I believe
 
00:52:37.710 --> 00:52:37.720 align:start position:0%
that you've already run much of this or
 
00:52:39.630 --> 00:52:39.640 align:start position:0%
GRS has already run much of this
 
00:52:42.390 --> 00:52:42.400 align:start position:0%
analysis because they've they've done it
 
00:52:44.950 --> 00:52:44.960 align:start position:0%
at 20 years and at 30 years so this
 
00:52:49.430 --> 00:52:49.440 align:start position:0%
would be relatively simple to have GRS
 
00:52:53.349 --> 00:52:53.359 align:start position:0%
do would wouldn't that not be the
 
00:52:59.150 --> 00:52:59.160 align:start position:0%
case probably um so I if I'm may I
 
00:53:01.190 --> 00:53:01.200 align:start position:0%
repeat sort of what I'm hearing back and
 
00:53:05.470 --> 00:53:05.480 align:start position:0%
make sure that um so so one one I I know
 
00:53:07.589 --> 00:53:07.599 align:start position:0%
you were talking about you know as of
 
00:53:10.270 --> 00:53:10.280 align:start position:0%
the effective date Senator gray but it
 
00:53:12.150 --> 00:53:12.160 align:start position:0%
might be cleaner to if you say you know
 
00:53:15.069 --> 00:53:15.079 align:start position:0%
the acrs for years of service are you
 
00:53:18.109 --> 00:53:18.119 align:start position:0%
know between 2.0 and 2.5 for everybody
 
00:53:20.789 --> 00:53:20.799 align:start position:0%
in group two right now or whatever they
 
00:53:22.589 --> 00:53:22.599 align:start position:0%
are in the statute for their first 20
 
00:53:25.349 --> 00:53:25.359 align:start position:0%
years of service and then at year 20 and
 
00:53:27.230 --> 00:53:27.240 align:start position:0%
every year work thereafter they're recre
 
00:53:30.030 --> 00:53:30.040 align:start position:0%
a 2 and a half% premium for those years
 
00:53:32.670 --> 00:53:32.680 align:start position:0%
so it you know so so the longer you work
 
00:53:34.789 --> 00:53:34.799 align:start position:0%
the the multiplier is larger after 20
 
00:53:38.789 --> 00:53:38.799 align:start position:0%
years is that generally what you yeah
 
00:53:40.710 --> 00:53:40.720 align:start position:0%
and the only difference would be whether
 
00:53:43.750 --> 00:53:43.760 align:start position:0%
or not it was retroactive to someone who
 
00:53:46.190 --> 00:53:46.200 align:start position:0%
at passage of the bill had 23 years of
 
00:53:49.789 --> 00:53:49.799 align:start position:0%
service and was at a 2 point probably
 
00:53:52.870 --> 00:53:52.880 align:start position:0%
two four four I think is with those
 
00:53:55.750 --> 00:53:55.760 align:start position:0%
numbers where they would be now
 
00:53:58.589 --> 00:53:58.599 align:start position:0%
uh but whether or not we we boost them
 
00:54:01.710 --> 00:54:01.720 align:start position:0%
the extra or not I I'm willing to go
 
00:54:04.670 --> 00:54:04.680 align:start position:0%
either way because it's it's all good
 
00:54:07.750 --> 00:54:07.760 align:start position:0%
data yeah there there's like the first
 
00:54:09.990 --> 00:54:10.000 align:start position:0%
year and a half of the people in the
 
00:54:11.950 --> 00:54:11.960 align:start position:0%
transition table and that 8 to1 group
 
00:54:14.470 --> 00:54:14.480 align:start position:0%
would have hit their 20 years and 2022
 
00:54:15.670 --> 00:54:15.680 align:start position:0%
were this year is when they would have
 
00:54:17.789 --> 00:54:17.799 align:start position:0%
started hitting that so they just became
 
00:54:21.470 --> 00:54:21.480 align:start position:0%
eligible with the 46 and 21 to retire in
 
00:54:23.589 --> 00:54:23.599 align:start position:0%
February so you know there's you know
 
00:54:25.230 --> 00:54:25.240 align:start position:0%
I'm sure there's been some retirements
 
00:54:28.349 --> 00:54:28.359 align:start position:0%
that cohort but um it's fair early in
 
00:54:32.950 --> 00:54:32.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:36.670 --> 00:54:36.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:40.990 --> 00:54:41.000 align:start position:0%
that's and this proposal affects group
 
00:54:44.190 --> 00:54:44.200 align:start position:0%
everyone who is currently
 
00:54:46.670 --> 00:54:46.680 align:start position:0%
working in future hires as well and
 
00:54:50.069 --> 00:54:50.079 align:start position:0%
future hires okay it is not just for the
 
00:54:52.789 --> 00:54:52.799 align:start position:0%
the group be Senator Bradley you had a
 
00:54:55.109 --> 00:54:55.119 align:start position:0%
comment so I I know that there's a lot
 
00:54:57.789 --> 00:54:57.799 align:start position:0%
lot of angst about this proposal from
 
00:55:03.030 --> 00:55:03.040 align:start position:0%
some folks and um but just as you
 
00:55:07.589 --> 00:55:07.599 align:start position:0%
supported the analysis of 2259 I think
 
00:55:09.430 --> 00:55:09.440 align:start position:0%
it would be appropriate to support the
 
00:55:12.630 --> 00:55:12.640 align:start position:0%
analysis of Senator Grace Just because
 
00:55:14.549 --> 00:55:14.559 align:start position:0%
more information even though it costs
 
00:55:16.349 --> 00:55:16.359 align:start position:0%
money to get the information is probably
 
00:55:20.150 --> 00:55:20.160 align:start position:0%
better than no information so I would
 
00:55:23.349 --> 00:55:23.359 align:start position:0%
speak in favor of Senator Gray's
 
00:55:28.510 --> 00:55:28.520 align:start position:0%
proposal at the 2.5% in 20 years okay
 
00:55:30.710 --> 00:55:30.720 align:start position:0%
I'd like to mention that this would even
 
00:55:33.630 --> 00:55:33.640 align:start position:0%
if we intended to terminally fund the
 
00:55:37.230 --> 00:55:37.240 align:start position:0%
change that it would involve
 
00:55:42.950 --> 00:55:42.960 align:start position:0%
a followon increase for uh for all the
 
00:55:45.430 --> 00:55:45.440 align:start position:0%
employers once youve you've got people
 
00:55:48.270 --> 00:55:48.280 align:start position:0%
that are in longer service employees who
 
00:55:52.270 --> 00:55:52.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:55.390 --> 00:55:55.400 align:start position:0%
pension yes representative lashman
 
00:55:57.670 --> 00:55:57.680 align:start position:0%
thanks Madam chair with the last
 
00:56:00.510 --> 00:56:00.520 align:start position:0%
proposal we voted on we actually saw an
 
00:56:03.549 --> 00:56:03.559 align:start position:0%
amendment uh with language to support
 
00:56:05.990 --> 00:56:06.000 align:start position:0%
the proposal do we have an amendment
 
00:56:09.549 --> 00:56:09.559 align:start position:0%
that would support this
 
00:56:12.670 --> 00:56:12.680 align:start position:0%
proposal uh I don't believe
 
00:56:15.630 --> 00:56:15.640 align:start position:0%
so if you want to take a recess so that
 
00:56:19.270 --> 00:56:19.280 align:start position:0%
we can draft it I'd be happy to do that
 
00:56:23.910 --> 00:56:23.920 align:start position:0%
again you know I'm fighting for that uh
 
00:56:27.190 --> 00:56:27.200 align:start position:0%
65.1% uh that the proposal that's uh
 
00:56:29.870 --> 00:56:29.880 align:start position:0%
being evaluated doesn't affect those are
 
00:56:31.470 --> 00:56:31.480 align:start position:0%
the ones I've been fighting for to give
 
00:56:34.950 --> 00:56:34.960 align:start position:0%
them something to help the retention and
 
00:56:36.589 --> 00:56:36.599 align:start position:0%
certainly if you want to take a recess
 
00:56:38.870 --> 00:56:38.880 align:start position:0%
or you want to delay this until the next
 
00:56:42.309 --> 00:56:42.319 align:start position:0%
meeting that can be done but the only
 
00:56:46.710 --> 00:56:46.720 align:start position:0%
thing you're hurting is that 65% of the
 
00:56:51.510 --> 00:56:51.520 align:start position:0%
people that the current proposal doesn't
 
00:56:51.520 --> 00:56:53.470 align:start position:0%
people that the current proposal doesn't
affect

00:56:53.470 --> 00:56:53.480 align:start position:0%
affect
 
00:56:57.270 --> 00:56:57.280 align:start position:0%
okay any other other questions or
 
00:56:57.280 --> 00:56:59.349 align:start position:0%
okay any other other questions or
comments

00:56:59.349 --> 00:56:59.359 align:start position:0%
comments
 
00:57:02.549 --> 00:57:02.559 align:start position:0%
right just you know not withstanding
 
00:57:04.510 --> 00:57:04.520 align:start position:0%
whether a formal amendment was drafted I
 
00:57:06.670 --> 00:57:06.680 align:start position:0%
know certainly the retirement system in
 
00:57:09.190 --> 00:57:09.200 align:start position:0%
the actuary would prefer the will of the
 
00:57:11.549 --> 00:57:11.559 align:start position:0%
committee in sort of a written email to
 
00:57:13.150 --> 00:57:13.160 align:start position:0%
you know so so we have something to
 
00:57:14.990 --> 00:57:15.000 align:start position:0%
refer to we talked about it but just
 
00:57:16.750 --> 00:57:16.760 align:start position:0%
just having it documented even in a
 
00:57:19.470 --> 00:57:19.480 align:start position:0%
couple of sentence would probably be
 
00:57:22.789 --> 00:57:22.799 align:start position:0%
best for all of us yes I agree with you
 
00:57:26.349 --> 00:57:26.359 align:start position:0%
um however I think that if you think you
 
00:57:28.430 --> 00:57:28.440 align:start position:0%
understand it and Senator gray thinks he
 
00:57:28.440 --> 00:57:29.430 align:start position:0%
understand it and Senator gray thinks he
understands

00:57:29.430 --> 00:57:29.440 align:start position:0%
understands
 
00:57:33.789 --> 00:57:33.799 align:start position:0%
it uh we'll let my confusion go away
 
00:57:36.630 --> 00:57:36.640 align:start position:0%
and the question is do we think it's
 
00:57:39.309 --> 00:57:39.319 align:start position:0%
worthwhile asking for an analysis of
 
00:57:42.990 --> 00:57:43.000 align:start position:0%
this which would be an an improved
 
00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:44.750 align:start position:0%
this which would be an an improved
benefit

00:57:44.750 --> 00:57:44.760 align:start position:0%
benefit
 
00:57:44.760 --> 00:57:46.829 align:start position:0%
benefit
for

00:57:46.829 --> 00:57:46.839 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:57:50.270 --> 00:57:50.280 align:start position:0%
um all the group group two people in in
 
00:57:50.280 --> 00:57:51.230 align:start position:0%
um all the group group two people in in
the

00:57:51.230 --> 00:57:51.240 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:57:53.789 --> 00:57:53.799 align:start position:0%
system and would would it be
 
00:57:53.799 --> 00:57:56.589 align:start position:0%
system and would would it be
acceptable

00:57:56.589 --> 00:57:56.599 align:start position:0%
acceptable
 
00:57:59.230 --> 00:57:59.240 align:start position:0%
Senator GRE the written language and
 
00:58:02.349 --> 00:58:02.359 align:start position:0%
taking what's on top of the page two
 
00:58:06.109 --> 00:58:06.119 align:start position:0%
would be uh excuse me Senator please
 
00:58:09.990 --> 00:58:10.000 align:start position:0%
don't say yeah great if you'd put it in
 
00:58:12.589 --> 00:58:12.599 align:start position:0%
email it to me with the exact words you
 
00:58:16.309 --> 00:58:16.319 align:start position:0%
want I'll I'll be and and the retirement
 
00:58:20.589 --> 00:58:20.599 align:start position:0%
system well if the members have this um
 
00:58:22.630 --> 00:58:22.640 align:start position:0%
it would be very easy for them to follow
 
00:58:25.069 --> 00:58:25.079 align:start position:0%
along with what I'm going to say and can
 
00:58:27.029 --> 00:58:27.039 align:start position:0%
email it to you in addition to that
 
00:58:31.029 --> 00:58:31.039 align:start position:0%
please do so the words would be increase
 
00:58:34.710 --> 00:58:34.720 align:start position:0%
the multiplier to
 
00:58:38.190 --> 00:58:38.200 align:start position:0%
2.5% for all group two members for every
 
00:58:43.390 --> 00:58:43.400 align:start position:0%
year exceeding 20 years
 
00:58:47.470 --> 00:58:47.480 align:start position:0%
worked thank you thank
 
00:58:49.990 --> 00:58:50.000 align:start position:0%
you all
 
00:58:53.710 --> 00:58:53.720 align:start position:0%
right so this vote Yes Senator
 
00:58:53.720 --> 00:58:55.309 align:start position:0%
right so this vote Yes Senator
Waters

00:58:55.309 --> 00:58:55.319 align:start position:0%
Waters
 
00:58:59.069 --> 00:58:59.079 align:start position:0%
if I I could ask a question Marty
 
00:59:02.510 --> 00:59:02.520 align:start position:0%
um given what um Senator gray has been
 
00:59:05.309 --> 00:59:05.319 align:start position:0%
proposing in this Actuarial study that
 
00:59:09.270 --> 00:59:09.280 align:start position:0%
you will undertake is there a way of in
 
00:59:12.109 --> 00:59:12.119 align:start position:0%
that study
 
00:59:14.549 --> 00:59:14.559 align:start position:0%
to separate
 
00:59:19.510 --> 00:59:19.520 align:start position:0%
out just those folks in the the tierc so
 
00:59:21.990 --> 00:59:22.000 align:start position:0%
what I'm trying to get at is if we did
 
00:59:24.230 --> 00:59:24.240 align:start position:0%
what we have been moving towards with
 
00:59:26.470 --> 00:59:26.480 align:start position:0%
the other you know the other Amendment
 
00:59:28.789 --> 00:59:28.799 align:start position:0%
but then we would have a separate number
 
00:59:30.710 --> 00:59:30.720 align:start position:0%
which would give us let's say we did
 
00:59:32.829 --> 00:59:32.839 align:start position:0%
that but then you know Senator gra say
 
00:59:34.710 --> 00:59:34.720 align:start position:0%
what about these other folks would we
 
00:59:36.430 --> 00:59:36.440 align:start position:0%
have a number that would be just that
 
00:59:39.430 --> 00:59:39.440 align:start position:0%
group C then who would then get this
 
00:59:43.270 --> 00:59:43.280 align:start position:0%
change I I I can inquire about that and
 
00:59:44.829 --> 00:59:44.839 align:start position:0%
you know let let the commission know
 
00:59:47.150 --> 00:59:47.160 align:start position:0%
what what the answer is I I initially
 
00:59:49.549 --> 00:59:49.559 align:start position:0%
think that is possible I you know
 
00:59:51.549 --> 00:59:51.559 align:start position:0%
honestly because the multiplier for the
 
00:59:53.109 --> 00:59:53.119 align:start position:0%
TRC folks is
 
00:59:55.630 --> 00:59:55.640 align:start position:0%
2.0% and it's an open-ended you know
 
00:59:57.029 --> 00:59:57.039 align:start position:0%
group Rolling forward it's also the
 
00:59:59.390 --> 00:59:59.400 align:start position:0%
majority now most of the cost of this
 
01:00:02.190 --> 01:00:02.200 align:start position:0%
proposal will probably fall on that tier
 
01:00:04.029 --> 01:00:04.039 align:start position:0%
because you know you're going from 2.4
 
01:00:07.510 --> 01:00:07.520 align:start position:0%
to 2.5 for somebody uh you know so so
 
01:00:10.109 --> 01:00:10.119 align:start position:0%
but I I can ask for a breakdown amidst
 
01:00:12.950 --> 01:00:12.960 align:start position:0%
the tears there thank you thank you all
 
01:00:14.829 --> 01:00:14.839 align:start position:0%
right so those who think we ought to ask
 
01:00:16.230 --> 01:00:16.240 align:start position:0%
for this
 
01:00:21.069 --> 01:00:21.079 align:start position:0%
analysis say I I I any
 
01:00:25.109 --> 01:00:25.119 align:start position:0%
opposed one opposed okay thank you
 
01:00:29.910 --> 01:00:29.920 align:start position:0%
all right so Senator gray will send to
 
01:00:33.670 --> 01:00:33.680 align:start position:0%
to me and to Mark Marty Carlin the the
 
01:00:37.029 --> 01:00:37.039 align:start position:0%
wording he wants to prefer and Mr Carlin
 
01:00:39.829 --> 01:00:39.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:43.430 --> 01:00:43.440 align:start position:0%
analysis and do you think two weeks
 
01:00:45.829 --> 01:00:45.839 align:start position:0%
would be long enough to have it back and
 
01:00:50.270 --> 01:00:50.280 align:start position:0%
uh think we got the
 
01:00:50.280 --> 01:00:53.510 align:start position:0%
uh think we got the
firsts

01:00:53.510 --> 01:00:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:56.190 --> 01:00:56.200 align:start position:0%
microphone I said I think it took two
 
01:00:59.069 --> 01:00:59.079 align:start position:0%
weeks for the initial analysis of 228 58
 
01:01:01.309 --> 01:01:01.319 align:start position:0%
and 59 so I'm assuming it's going to be
 
01:01:02.829 --> 01:01:02.839 align:start position:0%
a similar ballpark I'm not sure what
 
01:01:05.430 --> 01:01:05.440 align:start position:0%
their other workload is for us or other
 
01:01:07.309 --> 01:01:07.319 align:start position:0%
clients at this time of year but I'll I
 
01:01:09.190 --> 01:01:09.200 align:start position:0%
can get the the meter running on this
 
01:01:10.910 --> 01:01:10.920 align:start position:0%
this afternoon after the meeting to to
 
01:01:13.069 --> 01:01:13.079 align:start position:0%
let them know this is coming and you
 
01:01:14.630 --> 01:01:14.640 align:start position:0%
know give them the details on the first
 
01:01:14.640 --> 01:01:23.430 align:start position:0%
know give them the details on the first
one

01:01:23.430 --> 01:01:23.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:23.440 --> 01:01:28.029 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:01:28.029 --> 01:01:28.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:29.910 --> 01:01:29.920 align:start position:0%
well since it will since it sounds like
 
01:01:32.470 --> 01:01:32.480 align:start position:0%
it might take longer than two weeks and
 
01:01:34.150 --> 01:01:34.160 align:start position:0%
we want to get more
 
01:01:39.510 --> 01:01:39.520 align:start position:0%
numbers um let's plan not to meet next
 
01:01:39.520 --> 01:01:45.390 align:start position:0%
numbers um let's plan not to meet next
week

01:01:45.390 --> 01:01:45.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:49.549 --> 01:01:49.559 align:start position:0%
and the 26 will probably not be a good
 
01:01:53.430 --> 01:01:53.440 align:start position:0%
day no okay thank
 
01:01:57.309 --> 01:01:57.319 align:start position:0%
you all right so November
 
01:02:00.549 --> 01:02:00.559 align:start position:0%
2nd do you think you will have October
 
01:02:05.309 --> 01:02:05.319 align:start position:0%
data by that time or uh yeah we won't
 
01:02:07.190 --> 01:02:07.200 align:start position:0%
have the final numbers but we'll close
 
01:02:10.269 --> 01:02:10.279 align:start position:0%
enough pretty close yeah okay so in that
 
01:02:12.670 --> 01:02:12.680 align:start position:0%
case I would suggest our next meeting be
 
01:02:12.680 --> 01:02:18.190 align:start position:0%
case I would suggest our next meeting be
November

01:02:18.190 --> 01:02:18.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:21.789 --> 01:02:21.799 align:start position:0%
2nd and for and at that meeting we will
 
01:02:25.230 --> 01:02:25.240 align:start position:0%
have an update on revenues we will have
 
01:02:27.750 --> 01:02:27.760 align:start position:0%
the cost analysis of Senator Gray's
 
01:02:30.630 --> 01:02:30.640 align:start position:0%
proposal and of the
 
01:02:34.510 --> 01:02:34.520 align:start position:0%
revised um short-term proposal from
 
01:02:34.520 --> 01:02:35.510 align:start position:0%
revised um short-term proposal from
Senator

01:02:35.510 --> 01:02:35.520 align:start position:0%
Senator
 
01:02:40.109 --> 01:02:40.119 align:start position:0%
Bradley with with Mr R's changes and is
 
01:02:41.910 --> 01:02:41.920 align:start position:0%
there anything else that we should
 
01:02:44.950 --> 01:02:44.960 align:start position:0%
discuss now or prepare to discuss at the
 
01:02:44.960 --> 01:02:48.029 align:start position:0%
discuss now or prepare to discuss at the
next

01:02:48.029 --> 01:02:48.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:52.309 --> 01:02:52.319 align:start position:0%
meeting okay Mr Fuller yes I'm not sure
 
01:02:53.589 --> 01:02:53.599 align:start position:0%
if this is an appropriate time to bring
 
01:02:55.549 --> 01:02:55.559 align:start position:0%
it up but just last time we met just I
 
01:02:57.230 --> 01:02:57.240 align:start position:0%
brought some some thoughts forward so
 
01:02:58.470 --> 01:02:58.480 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure if the members wanted any
 
01:03:00.589 --> 01:03:00.599 align:start position:0%
more discussion on those on those items
 
01:03:03.150 --> 01:03:03.160 align:start position:0%
or um so I know some of them too were
 
01:03:06.069 --> 01:03:06.079 align:start position:0%
also some items for some future
 
01:03:09.510 --> 01:03:09.520 align:start position:0%
Actuarial stuff or items being asked for
 
01:03:12.150 --> 01:03:12.160 align:start position:0%
or just plain requests being made either
 
01:03:14.390 --> 01:03:14.400 align:start position:0%
for the short term or the long term so
 
01:03:15.549 --> 01:03:15.559 align:start position:0%
um whether we want I'm not sure if it
 
01:03:16.990 --> 01:03:17.000 align:start position:0%
it's appropriate to bring that up for
 
01:03:21.789 --> 01:03:21.799 align:start position:0%
now or well future it's if we are
 
01:03:24.549 --> 01:03:24.559 align:start position:0%
ever if we're ever going to discuss
 
01:03:27.630 --> 01:03:27.640 align:start position:0%
seriously I mean we did we got them and
 
01:03:31.150 --> 01:03:31.160 align:start position:0%
we brainstormed a little uh which one or
 
01:03:34.109 --> 01:03:34.119 align:start position:0%
ones in particular do you think we ought
 
01:03:52.029 --> 01:03:52.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:56.230 --> 01:03:56.240 align:start position:0%
on all right
 
01:03:58.190 --> 01:03:58.200 align:start position:0%
so if it's okay I'll just briefly touch
 
01:04:00.630 --> 01:04:00.640 align:start position:0%
upon so for instance proposal number one
 
01:04:03.470 --> 01:04:03.480 align:start position:0%
with like reestablishing a cola account
 
01:04:05.750 --> 01:04:05.760 align:start position:0%
that wouldn't be something that I'd be
 
01:04:07.950 --> 01:04:07.960 align:start position:0%
proposing that we obviously do anytime
 
01:04:10.789 --> 01:04:10.799 align:start position:0%
that would be more of an assessment of
 
01:04:13.069 --> 01:04:13.079 align:start position:0%
the cost of things so I'm not really
 
01:04:15.589 --> 01:04:15.599 align:start position:0%
sure I I know I know bringing up colus
 
01:04:18.230 --> 01:04:18.240 align:start position:0%
but um so again that be that that's more
 
01:04:22.589 --> 01:04:22.599 align:start position:0%
in the assessment category anyways um uh
 
01:04:24.589 --> 01:04:24.599 align:start position:0%
proposal number two which was the Port
 
01:04:28.510 --> 01:04:28.520 align:start position:0%
staff inclusion and that was the uh that
 
01:04:31.109 --> 01:04:31.119 align:start position:0%
was extending the pension system to
 
01:04:34.069 --> 01:04:34.079 align:start position:0%
part-timers yes I think there's a whole
 
01:04:38.670 --> 01:04:38.680 align:start position:0%
lot more issues involved with granting
 
01:04:40.269 --> 01:04:40.279 align:start position:0%
benefits to part-
 
01:04:43.630 --> 01:04:43.640 align:start position:0%
timers and I I don't know if we have the
 
01:04:45.710 --> 01:04:45.720 align:start position:0%
the skills or the knowledge to deal with
 
01:04:48.470 --> 01:04:48.480 align:start position:0%
that without a lot of
 
01:04:52.230 --> 01:04:52.240 align:start position:0%
research uh so i' I'd be opposed to
 
01:04:55.190 --> 01:04:55.200 align:start position:0%
taking it up okay
 
01:04:58.549 --> 01:04:58.559 align:start position:0%
and proposal number Stacey you oh thank
 
01:05:00.349 --> 01:05:00.359 align:start position:0%
you madam chair I'd like to comment on
 
01:05:02.750 --> 01:05:02.760 align:start position:0%
that because we did my group did speak
 
01:05:05.029 --> 01:05:05.039 align:start position:0%
on that and we are absolutely opposed to
 
01:05:08.390 --> 01:05:08.400 align:start position:0%
that um basically you know obviously
 
01:05:10.750 --> 01:05:10.760 align:start position:0%
everybody has a lot of open positions
 
01:05:12.109 --> 01:05:12.119 align:start position:0%
but one of the things at the at the
 
01:05:14.470 --> 01:05:14.480 align:start position:0%
counties is we have a lot of part-time
 
01:05:16.510 --> 01:05:16.520 align:start position:0%
positions that are filled by people who
 
01:05:18.390 --> 01:05:18.400 align:start position:0%
have retired from the county and they
 
01:05:20.870 --> 01:05:20.880 align:start position:0%
come back they are the ones that cost us
 
01:05:23.750 --> 01:05:23.760 align:start position:0%
actually the least amount to have and uh
 
01:05:26.349 --> 01:05:26.359 align:start position:0%
you know basically we've spoken I've
 
01:05:28.349 --> 01:05:28.359 align:start position:0%
spoken with the HR people as well as
 
01:05:29.470 --> 01:05:29.480 align:start position:0%
many departments and they said they
 
01:05:30.750 --> 01:05:30.760 align:start position:0%
don't see this as a recruitment or
 
01:05:33.109 --> 01:05:33.119 align:start position:0%
retention it's not a tool so I mean if
 
01:05:33.950 --> 01:05:33.960 align:start position:0%
that's one of the things that we're
 
01:05:35.390 --> 01:05:35.400 align:start position:0%
looking at is trying to retain and
 
01:05:37.269 --> 01:05:37.279 align:start position:0%
recruit people this isn't one of them
 
01:05:38.549 --> 01:05:38.559 align:start position:0%
because people who working part
 
01:05:41.309 --> 01:05:41.319 align:start position:0%
part-time aren't looking for a career at
 
01:05:44.670 --> 01:05:44.680 align:start position:0%
the county so it appear it appears that
 
01:05:49.349 --> 01:05:49.359 align:start position:0%
the schools have set up a career path
 
01:05:53.069 --> 01:05:53.079 align:start position:0%
for part-time employees and I think
 
01:05:56.710 --> 01:05:56.720 align:start position:0%
that's both too spe very specific to the
 
01:05:58.829 --> 01:05:58.839 align:start position:0%
schools and it
 
01:06:01.150 --> 01:06:01.160 align:start position:0%
involves us in a whole lot of other
 
01:06:04.029 --> 01:06:04.039 align:start position:0%
questions with labor law that I'm I'm
 
01:06:06.710 --> 01:06:06.720 align:start position:0%
not sure I would extend a a defined
 
01:06:08.630 --> 01:06:08.640 align:start position:0%
benefit pension as the
 
01:06:12.470 --> 01:06:12.480 align:start position:0%
first benefit for a part-time
 
01:06:16.190 --> 01:06:16.200 align:start position:0%
person so I mam
 
01:06:16.200 --> 01:06:17.990 align:start position:0%
person so I mam
CH

01:06:17.990 --> 01:06:18.000 align:start position:0%
CH
 
01:06:21.910 --> 01:06:21.920 align:start position:0%
very I have to be recognized I would
 
01:06:24.589 --> 01:06:24.599 align:start position:0%
welcome that discussion because I think
 
01:06:27.910 --> 01:06:27.920 align:start position:0%
the overall mission of this group this
 
01:06:30.549 --> 01:06:30.559 align:start position:0%
commission involves a lot more than we
 
01:06:32.950 --> 01:06:32.960 align:start position:0%
did and we did start a good discussion
 
01:06:35.510 --> 01:06:35.520 align:start position:0%
back then and I do appreciate the
 
01:06:37.230 --> 01:06:37.240 align:start position:0%
comment from the
 
01:06:41.870 --> 01:06:41.880 align:start position:0%
municipal uh area I know that it is
 
01:06:45.470 --> 01:06:45.480 align:start position:0%
always enticing to have positions they
 
01:06:48.150 --> 01:06:48.160 align:start position:0%
full-time cut them up in two part times
 
01:06:50.230 --> 01:06:50.240 align:start position:0%
and then pay no benefits it's a it's a
 
01:06:52.430 --> 01:06:52.440 align:start position:0%
way to double dip into the system where
 
01:06:54.230 --> 01:06:54.240 align:start position:0%
you get the work but you you're not
 
01:06:57.390 --> 01:06:57.400 align:start position:0%
paying the benefits you know but the
 
01:07:00.190 --> 01:07:00.200 align:start position:0%
cost gets passed on to everybody else to
 
01:07:02.910 --> 01:07:02.920 align:start position:0%
pay that's what happens to the cost that
 
01:07:05.029 --> 01:07:05.039 align:start position:0%
it just gets pushed back and somebody
 
01:07:07.029 --> 01:07:07.039 align:start position:0%
else gets to pay so it's never a free
 
01:07:08.870 --> 01:07:08.880 align:start position:0%
thing it's a free loading thing but it's
 
01:07:11.510 --> 01:07:11.520 align:start position:0%
never a free thing somebody pays for it
 
01:07:13.069 --> 01:07:13.079 align:start position:0%
every time you got a position that is a
 
01:07:14.990 --> 01:07:15.000 align:start position:0%
retirement position and you have
 
01:07:17.269 --> 01:07:17.279 align:start position:0%
somebody come back and work because I'm
 
01:07:19.549 --> 01:07:19.559 align:start position:0%
already retired what do I do when they
 
01:07:21.870 --> 01:07:21.880 align:start position:0%
in fact the right thing to do is this
 
01:07:23.510 --> 01:07:23.520 align:start position:0%
when you work this positions they
 
01:07:25.510 --> 01:07:25.520 align:start position:0%
retirement positions you should pay so
 
01:07:27.029 --> 01:07:27.039 align:start position:0%
you work you pay it doesn't matter if
 
01:07:29.829 --> 01:07:29.839 align:start position:0%
it's 1 hour 20 hours or 40 hours if you
 
01:07:31.510 --> 01:07:31.520 align:start position:0%
already retired you're not going to
 
01:07:33.670 --> 01:07:33.680 align:start position:0%
retire again but we already have a
 
01:07:35.670 --> 01:07:35.680 align:start position:0%
system for that and it's called this
 
01:07:37.230 --> 01:07:37.240 align:start position:0%
when somebody works at the retirement
 
01:07:39.230 --> 01:07:39.240 align:start position:0%
system and doesn't retire and leave what
 
01:07:41.150 --> 01:07:41.160 align:start position:0%
happen to the money it doesn't evaporate
 
01:07:43.589 --> 01:07:43.599 align:start position:0%
it stays in the system so we already
 
01:07:45.990 --> 01:07:46.000 align:start position:0%
have a system to that but it's important
 
01:07:47.710 --> 01:07:47.720 align:start position:0%
that the employer should be paying to
 
01:07:50.349 --> 01:07:50.359 align:start position:0%
the retirement system so we don't get to
 
01:07:52.309 --> 01:07:52.319 align:start position:0%
push back the paying back because this
 
01:07:54.630 --> 01:07:54.640 align:start position:0%
is really the the the the bleeding that
 
01:07:56.549 --> 01:07:56.559 align:start position:0%
happens in the system it's not just one
 
01:07:58.589 --> 01:07:58.599 align:start position:0%
way there's two ways so that's important
 
01:08:00.750 --> 01:08:00.760 align:start position:0%
another thing I like to say is this
 
01:08:03.950 --> 01:08:03.960 align:start position:0%
there should be a way that when you are
 
01:08:06.870 --> 01:08:06.880 align:start position:0%
already vested retired so you vest in
 
01:08:09.630 --> 01:08:09.640 align:start position:0%
the retirement system but you left for
 
01:08:11.870 --> 01:08:11.880 align:start position:0%
whatever reason and you already vested
 
01:08:13.990 --> 01:08:14.000 align:start position:0%
you have money in the system if you come
 
01:08:16.189 --> 01:08:16.199 align:start position:0%
back to a position it should be a way
 
01:08:18.110 --> 01:08:18.120 align:start position:0%
that the employee should be able to
 
01:08:20.829 --> 01:08:20.839 align:start position:0%
contribute back again per hour one hour
 
01:08:23.990 --> 01:08:24.000 align:start position:0%
20 or 40 whatever hours you work we
 
01:08:25.630 --> 01:08:25.640 align:start position:0%
already have a system for that so all
 
01:08:28.349 --> 01:08:28.359 align:start position:0%
these things are win-win we have systems
 
01:08:29.590 --> 01:08:29.600 align:start position:0%
already in place we don't have to
 
01:08:31.349 --> 01:08:31.359 align:start position:0%
reinvent the wheel we have a system to
 
01:08:33.990 --> 01:08:34.000 align:start position:0%
that and I do understand that every time
 
01:08:35.950 --> 01:08:35.960 align:start position:0%
you talk to about employer how about
 
01:08:37.669 --> 01:08:37.679 align:start position:0%
making that contribution to retirement
 
01:08:40.630 --> 01:08:40.640 align:start position:0%
system you you know the position is well
 
01:08:42.630 --> 01:08:42.640 align:start position:0%
it's free it's cheaper and all that
 
01:08:45.070 --> 01:08:45.080 align:start position:0%
nothing there are some savings that we
 
01:08:47.829 --> 01:08:47.839 align:start position:0%
cannot afford this is a savings that's
 
01:08:50.110 --> 01:08:50.120 align:start position:0%
very expensive for many people for
 
01:08:52.390 --> 01:08:52.400 align:start position:0%
taxpayers for the retirement system and
 
01:08:54.269 --> 01:08:54.279 align:start position:0%
for the unfunded Liber not not only that
 
01:08:56.030 --> 01:08:56.040 align:start position:0%
it's wrong and we should change that to
 
01:08:59.229 --> 01:08:59.239 align:start position:0%
correct that i' like to mention that we
 
01:09:03.229 --> 01:09:03.239 align:start position:0%
had a bill this past year that would for
 
01:09:07.269 --> 01:09:07.279 align:start position:0%
uh penalize employers that canceled a
 
01:09:09.309 --> 01:09:09.319 align:start position:0%
retirement system job and replaced it
 
01:09:12.550 --> 01:09:12.560 align:start position:0%
with a parttime job uh we couldn't work
 
01:09:15.990 --> 01:09:16.000 align:start position:0%
out the details but I believe the the
 
01:09:18.149 --> 01:09:18.159 align:start position:0%
intent of it is coming back so I think
 
01:09:20.269 --> 01:09:20.279 align:start position:0%
that would be an appropriate way to say
 
01:09:22.550 --> 01:09:22.560 align:start position:0%
how do we how do we deal with the
 
01:09:24.950 --> 01:09:24.960 align:start position:0%
situation of employ employers or
 
01:09:27.749 --> 01:09:27.759 align:start position:0%
employees for that matter trying to game
 
01:09:30.030 --> 01:09:30.040 align:start position:0%
the system in this
 
01:09:32.229 --> 01:09:32.239 align:start position:0%
regard because it's going to require a
 
01:09:35.630 --> 01:09:35.640 align:start position:0%
law change to do it I appreciate that
 
01:09:37.829 --> 01:09:37.839 align:start position:0%
and I'm welcome to have that discussion
 
01:09:40.550 --> 01:09:40.560 align:start position:0%
because the real gaming that happens is
 
01:09:42.510 --> 01:09:42.520 align:start position:0%
when you terminate a full-time position
 
01:09:44.550 --> 01:09:44.560 align:start position:0%
you can break it up in two part-time
 
01:09:46.030 --> 01:09:46.040 align:start position:0%
positions and then you say you're going
 
01:09:47.309 --> 01:09:47.319 align:start position:0%
to pay no benefits not just the
 
01:09:48.709 --> 01:09:48.719 align:start position:0%
retirement benefits but no other
 
01:09:50.829 --> 01:09:50.839 align:start position:0%
benefits at all whatsoever that is wrong
 
01:09:52.829 --> 01:09:52.839 align:start position:0%
for our economy and we should not be
 
01:09:55.990 --> 01:09:56.000 align:start position:0%
doing that so I appreciate that and as
 
01:09:58.550 --> 01:09:58.560 align:start position:0%
well as finding a way that somebody
 
01:10:01.910 --> 01:10:01.920 align:start position:0%
who's already deferred vested and left
 
01:10:03.950 --> 01:10:03.960 align:start position:0%
for whatever reason you come back you
 
01:10:05.189 --> 01:10:05.199 align:start position:0%
should be paying to the retirement
 
01:10:06.910 --> 01:10:06.920 align:start position:0%
system I would like to do that if I was
 
01:10:08.870 --> 01:10:08.880 align:start position:0%
a person paying I would have no problem
 
01:10:12.350 --> 01:10:12.360 align:start position:0%
paying as well I have 36 years in if I
 
01:10:14.270 --> 01:10:14.280 align:start position:0%
retire and come back I should be paying
 
01:10:16.630 --> 01:10:16.640 align:start position:0%
to the retirement system and if somebody
 
01:10:19.070 --> 01:10:19.080 align:start position:0%
says but you're already retired but no
 
01:10:20.709 --> 01:10:20.719 align:start position:0%
difference than somebody else who worked
 
01:10:22.550 --> 01:10:22.560 align:start position:0%
three years and left have the money
 
01:10:23.830 --> 01:10:23.840 align:start position:0%
there the money is there doesn't
 
01:10:26.590 --> 01:10:26.600 align:start position:0%
evaporate and and and you have already a
 
01:10:27.910 --> 01:10:27.920 align:start position:0%
system to that I think it would be a
 
01:10:30.350 --> 01:10:30.360 align:start position:0%
fair thing to do and we should look into
 
01:10:33.709 --> 01:10:33.719 align:start position:0%
that thank you thank
 
01:10:37.870 --> 01:10:37.880 align:start position:0%
you Mr Fuller and and I I I appreciate
 
01:10:39.669 --> 01:10:39.679 align:start position:0%
the comments on that too so and I
 
01:10:40.910 --> 01:10:40.920 align:start position:0%
appreciate what you're saying as well as
 
01:10:42.310 --> 01:10:42.320 align:start position:0%
they get get will get a little bit
 
01:10:43.790 --> 01:10:43.800 align:start position:0%
complicated just one quick comment on
 
01:10:44.870 --> 01:10:44.880 align:start position:0%
that because I actually want to talk
 
01:10:46.669 --> 01:10:46.679 align:start position:0%
more about the vesting one right here
 
01:10:48.669 --> 01:10:48.679 align:start position:0%
next but um I want to make clear because
 
01:10:49.950 --> 01:10:49.960 align:start position:0%
I know there was some prior comments in
 
01:10:52.030 --> 01:10:52.040 align:start position:0%
our other meeting people would be
 
01:10:54.149 --> 01:10:54.159 align:start position:0%
concerned about people wanting to just
 
01:10:55.950 --> 01:10:55.960 align:start position:0%
you know all of a sudden get all their
 
01:10:57.790 --> 01:10:57.800 align:start position:0%
benefits in the last year it would be a
 
01:10:59.270 --> 01:10:59.280 align:start position:0%
percentage base so for instance if
 
01:11:01.870 --> 01:11:01.880 align:start position:0%
you're only working like say 20 hours
 
01:11:03.750 --> 01:11:03.760 align:start position:0%
you the proposal would be that you would
 
01:11:05.870 --> 01:11:05.880 align:start position:0%
only get like half the benefit so I mean
 
01:11:07.550 --> 01:11:07.560 align:start position:0%
there's nothing here in terms of wanting
 
01:11:10.470 --> 01:11:10.480 align:start position:0%
to allow the door to open so that people
 
01:11:12.910 --> 01:11:12.920 align:start position:0%
could get full-time benefits with only
 
01:11:14.310 --> 01:11:14.320 align:start position:0%
working parttime so that's not the
 
01:11:16.070 --> 01:11:16.080 align:start position:0%
intent and if I wasn't clear I was just
 
01:11:19.149 --> 01:11:19.159 align:start position:0%
wanted to clarify that real quick so um
 
01:11:21.270 --> 01:11:21.280 align:start position:0%
but actually I wanted to really mention
 
01:11:22.910 --> 01:11:22.920 align:start position:0%
here I wanted to briefly go over all of
 
01:11:24.870 --> 01:11:24.880 align:start position:0%
them but just with the vesting one right
 
01:11:27.030 --> 01:11:27.040 align:start position:0%
here which was number three um
 
01:11:28.669 --> 01:11:28.679 align:start position:0%
established five years of credible
 
01:11:30.149 --> 01:11:30.159 align:start position:0%
service would be considered to be
 
01:11:33.030 --> 01:11:33.040 align:start position:0%
vesting and again that would match us up
 
01:11:34.990 --> 01:11:35.000 align:start position:0%
with our with our neighbors because
 
01:11:36.430 --> 01:11:36.440 align:start position:0%
especially with the amount of years we
 
01:11:38.990 --> 01:11:39.000 align:start position:0%
need vesting right now um establishing
 
01:11:41.709 --> 01:11:41.719 align:start position:0%
only a fiveyear mark of being vested um
 
01:11:42.750 --> 01:11:42.760 align:start position:0%
I think that would be a really great
 
01:11:45.350 --> 01:11:45.360 align:start position:0%
tool to again to attract and retain our
 
01:11:48.070 --> 01:11:48.080 align:start position:0%
workers so
 
01:11:50.470 --> 01:11:50.480 align:start position:0%
okay again I I just want to comment that
 
01:11:52.950 --> 01:11:52.960 align:start position:0%
we support that we do we see that as a a
 
01:11:55.310 --> 01:11:55.320 align:start position:0%
very good attention recruitment tool is
 
01:11:56.790 --> 01:11:56.800 align:start position:0%
is reducing it down because what we're
 
01:11:58.870 --> 01:11:58.880 align:start position:0%
seeing at the counties is a lot of
 
01:12:02.430 --> 01:12:02.440 align:start position:0%
younger people who the 10year mark they
 
01:12:03.990 --> 01:12:04.000 align:start position:0%
they just don't see it as attainable
 
01:12:06.790 --> 01:12:06.800 align:start position:0%
five years probably is more palatable so
 
01:12:10.270 --> 01:12:10.280 align:start position:0%
we would be in favor of that okay
 
01:12:13.709 --> 01:12:13.719 align:start position:0%
Senator Waters thank you madam chair um
 
01:12:15.629 --> 01:12:15.639 align:start position:0%
on that that last one of the vesting and
 
01:12:17.470 --> 01:12:17.480 align:start position:0%
the five or the 10
 
01:12:20.790 --> 01:12:20.800 align:start position:0%
um you know after our discussion last
 
01:12:22.790 --> 01:12:22.800 align:start position:0%
time and it did seem to me the the word
 
01:12:24.229 --> 01:12:24.239 align:start position:0%
we were hearing that that really
 
01:12:26.669 --> 01:12:26.679 align:start position:0%
potentially would not have a financial
 
01:12:29.950 --> 01:12:29.960 align:start position:0%
impact um and so my question kind of to
 
01:12:31.510 --> 01:12:31.520 align:start position:0%
my Senate colleagues because we're still
 
01:12:34.430 --> 01:12:34.440 align:start position:0%
in a filing period is if if either now
 
01:12:36.830 --> 01:12:36.840 align:start position:0%
or maybe in February the late filing if
 
01:12:38.590 --> 01:12:38.600 align:start position:0%
this is something that this commission
 
01:12:41.350 --> 01:12:41.360 align:start position:0%
reaches a consensus on maybe we could
 
01:12:44.470 --> 01:12:44.480 align:start position:0%
put something uh in in in February or
 
01:12:47.270 --> 01:12:47.280 align:start position:0%
even by four o'clock today but I again I
 
01:12:51.189 --> 01:12:51.199 align:start position:0%
I I think it's we need to know that that
 
01:12:53.990 --> 01:12:54.000 align:start position:0%
idea I hope we don't lose it um I think
 
01:12:56.350 --> 01:12:56.360 align:start position:0%
it makes a lot of sense and it would be
 
01:12:59.350 --> 01:12:59.360 align:start position:0%
possible to act on it this year if the
 
01:13:00.950 --> 01:13:00.960 align:start position:0%
commission has consensus I think we
 
01:13:03.470 --> 01:13:03.480 align:start position:0%
could find a vehicle to do
 
01:13:07.510 --> 01:13:07.520 align:start position:0%
it okay yeah that the impact on that
 
01:13:10.390 --> 01:13:10.400 align:start position:0%
would be that someone who left between
 
01:13:14.030 --> 01:13:14.040 align:start position:0%
five and 10 years would be eligible at a
 
01:13:17.430 --> 01:13:17.440 align:start position:0%
future date to receive a pension
 
01:13:17.440 --> 01:13:19.350 align:start position:0%
future date to receive a pension
and

01:13:19.350 --> 01:13:19.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:13:22.990 --> 01:13:23.000 align:start position:0%
um so I don't think we would have a very
 
01:13:25.910 --> 01:13:25.920 align:start position:0%
large effect but there would be some Mr
 
01:13:35.590 --> 01:13:35.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:38.430 --> 01:13:38.440 align:start position:0%
that uh yeah so so essentially since
 
01:13:40.990 --> 01:13:41.000 align:start position:0%
since pensions are currently calculated
 
01:13:42.750 --> 01:13:42.760 align:start position:0%
uh years of service is an important
 
01:13:45.189 --> 01:13:45.199 align:start position:0%
factor in that equation somebody with
 
01:13:47.149 --> 01:13:47.159 align:start position:0%
five or six years who left and then
 
01:13:48.629 --> 01:13:48.639 align:start position:0%
they'd have to wait until they reach
 
01:13:51.189 --> 01:13:51.199 align:start position:0%
whatever the statutory eligibility age
 
01:13:53.390 --> 01:13:53.400 align:start position:0%
or other requirements are in there they
 
01:13:56.350 --> 01:13:56.360 align:start position:0%
get a a pension on that that the
 
01:13:58.350 --> 01:13:58.360 align:start position:0%
percentage of their average final salary
 
01:13:59.790 --> 01:13:59.800 align:start position:0%
would be much smaller than somebody who
 
01:14:03.470 --> 01:14:03.480 align:start position:0%
worked a full career um another um thing
 
01:14:05.709 --> 01:14:05.719 align:start position:0%
the director Goodwin just mentioned too
 
01:14:09.189 --> 01:14:09.199 align:start position:0%
is with um with employee um employer
 
01:14:10.990 --> 01:14:11.000 align:start position:0%
employee refunds and I talked about that
 
01:14:12.629 --> 01:14:12.639 align:start position:0%
a couple weeks ago where people if they
 
01:14:14.950 --> 01:14:14.960 align:start position:0%
terminate before vesting or even after
 
01:14:17.350 --> 01:14:17.360 align:start position:0%
they can get their money back plus the
 
01:14:19.669 --> 01:14:19.679 align:start position:0%
interest it may reduce the amount of
 
01:14:21.709 --> 01:14:21.719 align:start position:0%
people seeking refunds you know because
 
01:14:23.030 --> 01:14:23.040 align:start position:0%
they'll just kind of let it ride for a
 
01:14:23.040 --> 01:14:23.990 align:start position:0%
they'll just kind of let it ride for a
small

01:14:23.990 --> 01:14:24.000 align:start position:0%
small
 
01:14:25.910 --> 01:14:25.920 align:start position:0%
stream of income and
 
01:14:28.510 --> 01:14:28.520 align:start position:0%
retirement uh making the calculations
 
01:14:30.870 --> 01:14:30.880 align:start position:0%
much more
 
01:14:34.510 --> 01:14:34.520 align:start position:0%
complicated all right Senator Bradley
 
01:14:36.669 --> 01:14:36.679 align:start position:0%
question thank you madam chair has the
 
01:14:40.790 --> 01:14:40.800 align:start position:0%
actuary actually looked at um this has
 
01:14:42.629 --> 01:14:42.639 align:start position:0%
there ever been a bill that's been
 
01:14:45.149 --> 01:14:45.159 align:start position:0%
analyzed no we've never had this as
 
01:14:48.990 --> 01:14:49.000 align:start position:0%
legislation I mean I I I can put the
 
01:14:50.990 --> 01:14:51.000 align:start position:0%
question to them when we're sending over
 
01:14:52.629 --> 01:14:52.639 align:start position:0%
these other analysis is just you know
 
01:14:55.030 --> 01:14:55.040 align:start position:0%
without doing in full analysis there's
 
01:14:57.590 --> 01:14:57.600 align:start position:0%
any way to give an order of magnitude
 
01:14:59.390 --> 01:14:59.400 align:start position:0%
impact on something like that they may
 
01:15:01.550 --> 01:15:01.560 align:start position:0%
say no we need to look at it more detail
 
01:15:03.709 --> 01:15:03.719 align:start position:0%
but I we can ask that preliminary
 
01:15:06.430 --> 01:15:06.440 align:start position:0%
question if obviously if a a proposal
 
01:15:08.830 --> 01:15:08.840 align:start position:0%
was put in as a as a bill you know they
 
01:15:11.070 --> 01:15:11.080 align:start position:0%
they do the full analysis for sure it
 
01:15:14.270 --> 01:15:14.280 align:start position:0%
would be an extremely simple bill you
 
01:15:16.669 --> 01:15:16.679 align:start position:0%
just have to change 10 to five in I
 
01:15:21.790 --> 01:15:21.800 align:start position:0%
think two places yeah um but the but it
 
01:15:23.629 --> 01:15:23.639 align:start position:0%
should be actually consider considered
 
01:15:26.110 --> 01:15:26.120 align:start position:0%
as a bill separate from everything else
 
01:15:29.550 --> 01:15:29.560 align:start position:0%
because that would be a a retention tool
 
01:15:31.910 --> 01:15:31.920 align:start position:0%
that might or might not be worth the
 
01:15:34.030 --> 01:15:34.040 align:start position:0%
cost when we don't know what the cost is
 
01:15:37.430 --> 01:15:37.440 align:start position:0%
yeah Mr re you had a comment I was just
 
01:15:38.669 --> 01:15:38.679 align:start position:0%
going to ask Madam chair if it would be
 
01:15:41.110 --> 01:15:41.120 align:start position:0%
appropriate uh for this commission to
 
01:15:43.870 --> 01:15:43.880 align:start position:0%
make a motion on that but you may have
 
01:15:46.470 --> 01:15:46.480 align:start position:0%
just answered my question yes please if
 
01:15:48.470 --> 01:15:48.480 align:start position:0%
you wish to make a motion uh yes I'd
 
01:15:49.830 --> 01:15:49.840 align:start position:0%
like to make a motion that this
 
01:15:52.870 --> 01:15:52.880 align:start position:0%
commission um draft language that would
 
01:15:55.750 --> 01:15:55.760 align:start position:0%
EST establish uh a vesting period of
 
01:15:57.870 --> 01:15:57.880 align:start position:0%
five years for the retirement system
 
01:16:00.910 --> 01:16:00.920 align:start position:0%
I'll second it okay
 
01:16:04.350 --> 01:16:04.360 align:start position:0%
seconded Miss Stacy got in before you
 
01:16:08.310 --> 01:16:08.320 align:start position:0%
all right so the intent of this is that
 
01:16:11.070 --> 01:16:11.080 align:start position:0%
we would change the statute to establish
 
01:16:14.709 --> 01:16:14.719 align:start position:0%
five-year vesting for all people in the
 
01:16:17.229 --> 01:16:17.239 align:start position:0%
retirement system
 
01:16:20.310 --> 01:16:20.320 align:start position:0%
and put it in as a bill for next year
 
01:16:21.709 --> 01:16:21.719 align:start position:0%
which will then receive the full
 
01:16:24.310 --> 01:16:24.320 align:start position:0%
Actuarial analysis
 
01:16:28.270 --> 01:16:28.280 align:start position:0%
Senator Bradley um could I ask you Brian
 
01:16:31.470 --> 01:16:31.480 align:start position:0%
to amend your
 
01:16:34.830 --> 01:16:34.840 align:start position:0%
motion and ask Senator
 
01:16:37.110 --> 01:16:37.120 align:start position:0%
Waters instead of making a
 
01:16:39.470 --> 01:16:39.480 align:start position:0%
recommendation that the committee
 
01:16:42.350 --> 01:16:42.360 align:start position:0%
recommends that we do this recommend
 
01:16:44.990 --> 01:16:45.000 align:start position:0%
that Senator Waters file that as a bill
 
01:16:47.550 --> 01:16:47.560 align:start position:0%
and he has two hours and 13 minutes to
 
01:16:52.709 --> 01:16:52.719 align:start position:0%
do it um my colle Senator Susi like to
 
01:16:57.229 --> 01:16:57.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:00.070 --> 01:17:00.080 align:start position:0%
Okay the reason for that is
 
01:17:03.390 --> 01:17:03.400 align:start position:0%
then this discussion then would not be
 
01:17:05.629 --> 01:17:05.639 align:start position:0%
like do we support five years do we not
 
01:17:09.550 --> 01:17:09.560 align:start position:0%
support five years not be in a vacuum I
 
01:17:13.510 --> 01:17:13.520 align:start position:0%
think that Kathy makes a good point um I
 
01:17:16.470 --> 01:17:16.480 align:start position:0%
don't know Dave if you have any thoughts
 
01:17:18.310 --> 01:17:18.320 align:start position:0%
from the municipal
 
01:17:20.590 --> 01:17:20.600 align:start position:0%
Association i' I'd like to know what the
 
01:17:24.149 --> 01:17:24.159 align:start position:0%
cost is if it's a nominal cost I would
 
01:17:26.030 --> 01:17:26.040 align:start position:0%
agree with the Employers in the room
 
01:17:28.189 --> 01:17:28.199 align:start position:0%
that as well as the employees is
 
01:17:30.430 --> 01:17:30.440 align:start position:0%
probably a good idea but that way if the
 
01:17:33.550 --> 01:17:33.560 align:start position:0%
motion was Senator Waters filed the bill
 
01:17:36.350 --> 01:17:36.360 align:start position:0%
or Senator Susi filed the bill then that
 
01:17:38.750 --> 01:17:38.760 align:start position:0%
whole analysis and the public hearing
 
01:17:40.990 --> 01:17:41.000 align:start position:0%
happened so I'd I'd be more comfortable
 
01:17:43.830 --> 01:17:43.840 align:start position:0%
with that I'm happy to amend my motion
 
01:17:47.110 --> 01:17:47.120 align:start position:0%
to have Senator I would second that okay
 
01:17:49.350 --> 01:17:49.360 align:start position:0%
as long as it's Senator Susi or Waters
 
01:17:52.270 --> 01:17:52.280 align:start position:0%
that files the bill I see those
 
01:17:54.550 --> 01:17:54.560 align:start position:0%
Democrats you're trying to say right no
 
01:17:57.470 --> 01:17:57.480 align:start position:0%
Waters it's because you were bragging or
 
01:17:59.270 --> 01:17:59.280 align:start position:0%
was the senator Susi bragging you only
 
01:18:00.270 --> 01:18:00.280 align:start position:0%
have four
 
01:18:03.110 --> 01:18:03.120 align:start position:0%
bills as long as it he basically means
 
01:18:06.669 --> 01:18:06.679 align:start position:0%
somebody other than Senator Bradley yes
 
01:18:08.629 --> 01:18:08.639 align:start position:0%
okay everyone understand the
 
01:18:11.310 --> 01:18:11.320 align:start position:0%
motion and then the maker of the second
 
01:18:13.550 --> 01:18:13.560 align:start position:0%
only motion we have to agree the motion
 
01:18:17.470 --> 01:18:17.480 align:start position:0%
was made by yeah was amended by yes made
 
01:18:19.950 --> 01:18:19.960 align:start position:0%
and amended by Mr R seconded by Miss
 
01:18:23.590 --> 01:18:23.600 align:start position:0%
Stacy both times okay those in favor
 
01:18:23.600 --> 01:18:24.990 align:start position:0%
Stacy both times okay those in favor
I

01:18:24.990 --> 01:18:25.000 align:start position:0%
I
 
01:18:28.590 --> 01:18:28.600 align:start position:0%
opposed okay Senator you've uh got your
 
01:18:30.709 --> 01:18:30.719 align:start position:0%
got your marching
 
01:18:30.719 --> 01:18:33.669 align:start position:0%
got your marching
orders

01:18:33.669 --> 01:18:33.679 align:start position:0%
orders
 
01:18:37.390 --> 01:18:37.400 align:start position:0%
okay okay Mr Fuller okay then I'll I'll
 
01:18:39.590 --> 01:18:39.600 align:start position:0%
be quick I don't want to hold anybody up
 
01:18:41.590 --> 01:18:41.600 align:start position:0%
and this the the last two things I I
 
01:18:43.910 --> 01:18:43.920 align:start position:0%
brought up on previous were about um the
 
01:18:45.950 --> 01:18:45.960 align:start position:0%
definition of earnable compensation and
 
01:18:49.189 --> 01:18:49.199 align:start position:0%
then also the uh potential change in AFC
 
01:18:50.590 --> 01:18:50.600 align:start position:0%
calculations so I just didn't know if
 
01:18:52.070 --> 01:18:52.080 align:start position:0%
anyone else had any other thoughts on
 
01:18:54.430 --> 01:18:54.440 align:start position:0%
those items or
 
01:18:58.070 --> 01:18:58.080 align:start position:0%
uh I'd like to mention that when we made
 
01:19:00.870 --> 01:19:00.880 align:start position:0%
what we thought were incredibly trivial
 
01:19:05.709 --> 01:19:05.719 align:start position:0%
changes to to that in House Bill 436 it
 
01:19:09.110 --> 01:19:09.120 align:start position:0%
ended up being better than $60
 
01:19:14.270 --> 01:19:14.280 align:start position:0%
million um Mr Carla yeah actually with
 
01:19:16.910 --> 01:19:16.920 align:start position:0%
um House Bill 436 and also House Bill
 
01:19:20.310 --> 01:19:20.320 align:start position:0%
579 last year which would have restored
 
01:19:21.990 --> 01:19:22.000 align:start position:0%
the three-year average final
 
01:19:24.830 --> 01:19:24.840 align:start position:0%
compensation with the other pay types
 
01:19:28.550 --> 01:19:28.560 align:start position:0%
included in it for group two we we as a
 
01:19:31.310 --> 01:19:31.320 align:start position:0%
retirement system on our dime did ask
 
01:19:34.229 --> 01:19:34.239 align:start position:0%
the actuary what the cost would be
 
01:19:36.510 --> 01:19:36.520 align:start position:0%
analogous just for tier B in group one
 
01:19:37.910 --> 01:19:37.920 align:start position:0%
because just sort of trying to
 
01:19:40.510 --> 01:19:40.520 align:start position:0%
anticipate fusure impact so that that's
 
01:19:42.990 --> 01:19:43.000 align:start position:0%
actually on on the last page of the grid
 
01:19:45.030 --> 01:19:45.040 align:start position:0%
there's a couple of group one uh
 
01:19:47.430 --> 01:19:47.440 align:start position:0%
projections and this is this is the
 
01:19:49.390 --> 01:19:49.400 align:start position:0%
approximately 11,000 members in group
 
01:19:51.229 --> 01:19:51.239 align:start position:0%
one tier B if you brought them back to a
 
01:19:53.950 --> 01:19:53.960 align:start position:0%
three-year AFC with V retirement
 
01:19:56.390 --> 01:19:56.400 align:start position:0%
incentive payouts leave payouts things
 
01:19:58.430 --> 01:19:58.440 align:start position:0%
like that that's about
 
01:20:02.390 --> 01:20:02.400 align:start position:0%
187 million on the UA plus an employer
 
01:20:05.790 --> 01:20:05.800 align:start position:0%
contribution uh increase it's
 
01:20:09.229 --> 01:20:09.239 align:start position:0%
nominal so that so we did it similar
 
01:20:10.709 --> 01:20:10.719 align:start position:0%
that's not split out that's not one of
 
01:20:12.510 --> 01:20:12.520 align:start position:0%
the other and you couldn't really cut it
 
01:20:13.830 --> 01:20:13.840 align:start position:0%
in half but it gives you an order of
 
01:20:16.350 --> 01:20:16.360 align:start position:0%
magnitude idea of of what that would
 
01:20:16.360 --> 01:20:18.189 align:start position:0%
magnitude idea of of what that would
would

01:20:18.189 --> 01:20:18.199 align:start position:0%
would
 
01:20:21.390 --> 01:20:21.400 align:start position:0%
entail Miss Stacy so I will just um
 
01:20:23.070 --> 01:20:23.080 align:start position:0%
Madam Shar just say that we in
 
01:20:25.750 --> 01:20:25.760 align:start position:0%
opposition to both those
 
01:20:28.110 --> 01:20:28.120 align:start position:0%
changes thank
 
01:20:28.120 --> 01:20:29.950 align:start position:0%
changes thank
you

01:20:29.950 --> 01:20:29.960 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:20:32.790 --> 01:20:32.800 align:start position:0%
okay anyone else have a have something
 
01:20:37.310 --> 01:20:37.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:37.320 --> 01:20:40.550 align:start position:0%
 
discuss

01:20:40.550 --> 01:20:40.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:45.110 --> 01:20:45.120 align:start position:0%
okay so so we will we will get our
 
01:20:48.270 --> 01:20:48.280 align:start position:0%
aterial analysis we will have a bill in
 
01:20:50.550 --> 01:20:50.560 align:start position:0%
the Senate on fiveyear vesting and we
 
01:20:53.629 --> 01:20:53.639 align:start position:0%
will meet again on November 2nd
 
01:21:21.629 --> 01:21:21.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:21.639 --> 01:21:24.639 align:start position:0%
 
all
