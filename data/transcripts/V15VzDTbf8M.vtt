committee knows we've been engaged in a
 
00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:46.720 align:start position:0%
process of drafting chapter 800 Solid
 
00:02:48.589 --> 00:02:48.599 align:start position:0%
Waste rules that lay out the design
 
00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:50.959 align:start position:0%
construction and operating requirements
 
00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.040 align:start position:0%
for landfills for about one year now uh
 
00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 align:start position:0%
that process has involved robust public
 
00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 align:start position:0%
involvement including several uh public
 
00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 align:start position:0%
listening sessions and informal comment
 
00:03:03.149 --> 00:03:03.159 align:start position:0%
periods um for the waste management
 
00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:04.640 align:start position:0%
division the first step in the formal
 
00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:06.440 align:start position:0%
rulem Maring process begins with
 
00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:08.239 align:start position:0%
presentation of its proposed rules to
 
00:03:09.789 --> 00:03:09.799 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Waste Management
 
00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 align:start position:0%
Council and that's prior to filing a
 
00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:13.640 align:start position:0%
rulemaking notice under the
 
00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:16.040 align:start position:0%
administrative procedures act the
 
00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:19.120 align:start position:0%
enabling law is RSA 2109 that
 
00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:20.560 align:start position:0%
establishes the New Hampshire Waste
 
00:03:22.789 --> 00:03:22.799 align:start position:0%
Management Council and it provides that
 
00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:25.400 align:start position:0%
the council has three important roles
 
00:03:27.509 --> 00:03:27.519 align:start position:0%
the first is to consult with and advise
 
00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:29.360 align:start position:0%
the director on the division's programs
 
00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:32.680 align:start position:0%
and operations the second is to hear all
 
00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 align:start position:0%
administrative appeals of the department
 
00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:37.760 align:start position:0%
uh of Department decisions that are
 
00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:39.959 align:start position:0%
administered by the division and the
 
00:03:41.949 --> 00:03:41.959 align:start position:0%
third is to review and weigh in on
 
00:03:44.229 --> 00:03:44.239 align:start position:0%
administrative rules proposed by the
 
00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280 align:start position:0%
division and under the statute uh the
 
00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:49.080 align:start position:0%
division presents its proposed rules to
 
00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:51.400 align:start position:0%
the council and the council has 15 days
 
00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:53.280 align:start position:0%
to present any objections to the
 
00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:55.920 align:start position:0%
proposed rule if the council objects to
 
00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:58.000 align:start position:0%
a rule the commissioner May adopt the
 
00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000 align:start position:0%
rule only after presenting a written
 
00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 align:start position:0%
reply to the council detailing the
 
00:04:04.949 --> 00:04:04.959 align:start position:0%
reasons for adopting the rule over its
 
00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:07.079 align:start position:0%
objections and in keeping with those
 
00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:10.120 align:start position:0%
requirements on January 18th um the
 
00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:11.840 align:start position:0%
division appeared before the waste
 
00:04:15.149 --> 00:04:15.159 align:start position:0%
council at its January meeting and uh we
 
00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:17.359 align:start position:0%
presented draft initial proposals for
 
00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:19.959 align:start position:0%

requirements during that meeting we
 
00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:29.080 align:start position:0%
heard many questions from the council
 
00:04:31.029 --> 00:04:31.039 align:start position:0%

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:33.280 align:start position:0%
impacts of the rules particularly with
 
00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:36.080 align:start position:0%
respect to chapter 800 and in the weeks
 
00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:38.120 align:start position:0%
immediately following that presentation
 
00:04:39.909 --> 00:04:39.919 align:start position:0%
we received substantive comments and
 
00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:42.160 align:start position:0%
requests to meet from both public and
 
00:04:44.629 --> 00:04:44.639 align:start position:0%

community so
 
00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:48.960 align:start position:0%

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:14.160 align:start position:0%
express significant concerns about the
 
00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:16.120 align:start position:0%
Draft rules and their potential impact
 
00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:18.720 align:start position:0%
on future expansion development and
 
00:05:21.189 --> 00:05:21.199 align:start position:0%
operation of solid waste landfills and
 
00:05:24.029 --> 00:05:24.039 align:start position:0%
Associated cost impacts we consider
 
00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:25.840 align:start position:0%
these concerns and in some areas we
 
00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:27.240 align:start position:0%
determined that there were appropriate
 
00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:29.120 align:start position:0%
changes to the draft proposal that
 
00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:32.080 align:start position:0%

revised draft proposal and that's a copy
 
00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:40.520 align:start position:0%
of which has been provided to this
 
00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:42.840 align:start position:0%
subcommittee and it is a track changes
 
00:05:44.469 --> 00:05:44.479 align:start position:0%
copy so it shows what changed from
 
00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:47.000 align:start position:0%
January 18th through the 15th of
 
00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:49.560 align:start position:0%
February and at that meeting the council
 
00:05:51.189 --> 00:05:51.199 align:start position:0%
took public comment from industry
 
00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:53.080 align:start position:0%
Representatives expressing many of these
 
00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:55.080 align:start position:0%
aformentioned concerns that I just
 
00:05:57.590 --> 00:05:57.600 align:start position:0%
outlined as a result of this the council
 
00:05:59.189 --> 00:05:59.199 align:start position:0%
decided to schedule a special meeting
 
00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:02.280 align:start position:0%
one week later on February 21st to
 
00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:04.720 align:start position:0%
further discuss the rules immediately
 
00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:06.280 align:start position:0%
prior to that meeting the council was
 
00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:08.000 align:start position:0%
presented with a letter from attorneys
 
00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:09.400 align:start position:0%
representing waste management New
 
00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:11.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Inc which outlined um the
 
00:06:13.749 --> 00:06:13.759 align:start position:0%
company's concerns about the February
 
00:06:16.629 --> 00:06:16.639 align:start position:0%
15th Draft rules during the meeting each
 
00:06:18.189 --> 00:06:18.199 align:start position:0%
counselor and attendance expressed
 
00:06:20.189 --> 00:06:20.199 align:start position:0%
significant concerns about the potential
 
00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:22.720 align:start position:0%
impacts of the proposed rules including
 
00:06:24.189 --> 00:06:24.199 align:start position:0%
their concerns that the rules would make
 
00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:26.000 align:start position:0%
it too difficult to expand existing
 
00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:29.080 align:start position:0%
landfills or to site new landfills would
 
00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:31.080 align:start position:0%
unne necessarily increase construction
 
00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:33.560 align:start position:0%
and operational costs of landfills and
 
00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:36.000 align:start position:0%
would drive up disposal costs burdening
 
00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:38.240 align:start position:0%
citizens municipalities and the New
 
00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:40.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire business Community during the
 
00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:42.160 align:start position:0%
meeting the council decided to draft a
 
00:06:45.029 --> 00:06:45.039 align:start position:0%
letter to Dees conveying its comments
 
00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:46.880 align:start position:0%
that letter was which was issued to
 
00:06:48.909 --> 00:06:48.919 align:start position:0%
commissioner Scott and to me and dated
 
00:06:51.749 --> 00:06:51.759 align:start position:0%
February 23rd outlined the council's
 
00:06:54.189 --> 00:06:54.199 align:start position:0%
concerns and urg Dees to reopt the
 
00:06:56.469 --> 00:06:56.479 align:start position:0%
currently existing chapter 800 rules as
 
00:06:59.150 --> 00:06:59.160 align:start position:0%
they exist today and in order to provide
 
00:07:01.390 --> 00:07:01.400 align:start position:0%
time to further engage the public and
 
00:07:03.309 --> 00:07:03.319 align:start position:0%
stakeholders in review of the proposed
 
00:07:05.749 --> 00:07:05.759 align:start position:0%
rules the council also appended the
 
00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:07.080 align:start position:0%
waste management in New Hampshire letter
 
00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:10.120 align:start position:0%
to its letter asking Dees to address its
 
00:07:13.029 --> 00:07:13.039 align:start position:0%
expressed concerns so upon review of the
 
00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:15.360 align:start position:0%
council's letter Dees has elected to
 
00:07:17.749 --> 00:07:17.759 align:start position:0%
consider further additions revisions to
 
00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:20.000 align:start position:0%
the draft proposal and present them to
 
00:07:22.469 --> 00:07:22.479 align:start position:0%
the council at its March meeting SCH
 
00:07:23.950 --> 00:07:23.960 align:start position:0%
which is now scheduled for Thursday
 
00:07:26.950 --> 00:07:26.960 align:start position:0%
March 21st thereafter we would expect to
 
00:07:29.469 --> 00:07:29.479 align:start position:0%
begin the formal rulemaking process by
 
00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:31.160 align:start position:0%
requesting a fiscal impact statement
 
00:07:33.350 --> 00:07:33.360 align:start position:0%
from the legislative budget assistant
 
00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:35.160 align:start position:0%
and following its receipt we would file
 
00:07:36.830 --> 00:07:36.840 align:start position:0%
a rulemaking notice with the office of
 
00:07:39.390 --> 00:07:39.400 align:start position:0%
legislative Services now this will
 
00:07:41.749 --> 00:07:41.759 align:start position:0%
likely result in a minor delay in filing
 
00:07:44.309 --> 00:07:44.319 align:start position:0%
the final proposal for these rules and
 
00:07:46.189 --> 00:07:46.199 align:start position:0%
so and and therefore adopting the final
 
00:07:48.950 --> 00:07:48.960 align:start position:0%
rule to a date that's beyond the J July
 
00:07:51.309 --> 00:07:51.319 align:start position:0%
1 deadline that we're working under
 
00:07:53.869 --> 00:07:53.879 align:start position:0%
however um I've been it's been made
 
00:07:56.029 --> 00:07:56.039 align:start position:0%
clear to me that by filing our proposal
 
00:07:58.749 --> 00:07:58.759 align:start position:0%
prior to the deadline Dees will ensure
 
00:08:00.390 --> 00:08:00.400 align:start position:0%
that the exist existing rules will
 
00:08:03.110 --> 00:08:03.120 align:start position:0%
remain in effect until the final rule is
 
00:08:05.070 --> 00:08:05.080 align:start position:0%
adopted and that would likely occur
 
00:08:07.070 --> 00:08:07.080 align:start position:0%
sometime depending on the jail cars
 
00:08:08.909 --> 00:08:08.919 align:start position:0%
schedule and other things that aren't
 
00:08:11.110 --> 00:08:11.120 align:start position:0%
entirely in our control sometime between
 
00:08:14.710 --> 00:08:14.720 align:start position:0%
July and September of this year Dees is
 
00:08:16.350 --> 00:08:16.360 align:start position:0%
confident that the proposed rules that
 
00:08:18.510 --> 00:08:18.520 align:start position:0%
will be filed will be superior in every
 
00:08:20.550 --> 00:08:20.560 align:start position:0%
respect to the existing rules they will
 
00:08:22.070 --> 00:08:22.080 align:start position:0%
be more protective of the environment
 
00:08:23.950 --> 00:08:23.960 align:start position:0%
and human health and they have been
 
00:08:26.230 --> 00:08:26.240 align:start position:0%
modernized to acknowledge and reflect
 
00:08:28.909 --> 00:08:28.919 align:start position:0%
advances in technology and the state of
 
00:08:30.670 --> 00:08:30.680 align:start position:0%
the practice of landfill design
 
00:08:33.149 --> 00:08:33.159 align:start position:0%
construction and operation they will
 
00:08:34.829 --> 00:08:34.839 align:start position:0%
reflect the collective experiences and
 
00:08:36.190 --> 00:08:36.200 align:start position:0%
learning of our permitting and
 
00:08:38.269 --> 00:08:38.279 align:start position:0%
compliance staff over the last 10 or so
 
00:08:40.389 --> 00:08:40.399 align:start position:0%
years relative to the types of problems
 
00:08:42.550 --> 00:08:42.560 align:start position:0%
that we see at landfills and how those
 
00:08:43.589 --> 00:08:43.599 align:start position:0%
problems can be addressed through
 
00:08:45.910 --> 00:08:45.920 align:start position:0%
improved rules they will put our
 
00:08:47.550 --> 00:08:47.560 align:start position:0%
landfill permitting and compliance
 
00:08:49.310 --> 00:08:49.320 align:start position:0%
monitoring programs on firmer and
 
00:08:51.470 --> 00:08:51.480 align:start position:0%
Sounder footing to make sure that the
 
00:08:53.310 --> 00:08:53.320 align:start position:0%
design construction and operational
 
00:08:55.790 --> 00:08:55.800 align:start position:0%
landfills moving forward is safer and
 
00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:56.710 align:start position:0%
landfills moving forward is safer and
more

00:08:56.710 --> 00:08:56.720 align:start position:0%
more
 
00:08:59.310 --> 00:08:59.320 align:start position:0%
sustainable I note that we will remain
 
00:09:01.230 --> 00:09:01.240 align:start position:0%
on our plan schedule with respect to the
 
00:09:03.670 --> 00:09:03.680 align:start position:0%
chapter 100 definitions Rule and the
 
00:09:06.389 --> 00:09:06.399 align:start position:0%
chapter 300 permitting rules the initial
 
00:09:08.110 --> 00:09:08.120 align:start position:0%
proposals for those chapters have been
 
00:09:10.350 --> 00:09:10.360 align:start position:0%
provided to the LBA along with the
 
00:09:12.670 --> 00:09:12.680 align:start position:0%
request for a fiscal impact statement so
 
00:09:14.509 --> 00:09:14.519 align:start position:0%
the formal rulemaking process for those
 
00:09:16.710 --> 00:09:16.720 align:start position:0%
chapters has begun and we'll be filing
 
00:09:18.389 --> 00:09:18.399 align:start position:0%
rulle making notices and scheduling
 
00:09:19.949 --> 00:09:19.959 align:start position:0%
public hearings for those rules in the
 
00:09:22.670 --> 00:09:22.680 align:start position:0%
coming weeks with that if there are any
 
00:09:24.590 --> 00:09:24.600 align:start position:0%
questions regarding what I presented uh
 
00:09:26.550 --> 00:09:26.560 align:start position:0%
I'd be happy to take them now um before
 
00:09:28.190 --> 00:09:28.200 align:start position:0%
we begin reviewing the list of questions
 
00:09:30.590 --> 00:09:30.600 align:start position:0%
that were provided by the subcommittee
 
00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:32.630 align:start position:0%
that were provided by the subcommittee
representative

00:09:32.630 --> 00:09:32.640 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:09:34.790 --> 00:09:34.800 align:start position:0%
Penza first I'd like to talk about the
 
00:09:38.509 --> 00:09:38.519 align:start position:0%
waste management Council So currently um
 
00:09:41.550 --> 00:09:41.560 align:start position:0%
it is I would say probably about 90%
 
00:09:44.630 --> 00:09:44.640 align:start position:0%
lopsided so you have um you know public
 
00:09:46.630 --> 00:09:46.640 align:start position:0%
interest which you would see that that
 
00:09:48.230 --> 00:09:48.240 align:start position:0%
would be the most important position to
 
00:09:49.750 --> 00:09:49.760 align:start position:0%
have in there that's the voice of the
 
00:09:54.190 --> 00:09:54.200 align:start position:0%
public right that's vacant um the other
 
00:09:57.190 --> 00:09:57.200 align:start position:0%
uh one two three four five members are
 
00:10:00.670 --> 00:10:00.680 align:start position:0%
either employed by um um companies that
 
00:10:02.590 --> 00:10:02.600 align:start position:0%
are employed by either waste management
 
00:10:03.949 --> 00:10:03.959 align:start position:0%
or cassella or the others so the
 
00:10:08.230 --> 00:10:08.240 align:start position:0%
industry um public health expert vacant
 
00:10:09.990 --> 00:10:10.000 align:start position:0%
municipal office
 
00:10:12.670 --> 00:10:12.680 align:start position:0%
vacant uh the only there's only one
 
00:10:14.190 --> 00:10:14.200 align:start position:0%
elected official which is a gentleman
 
00:10:17.910 --> 00:10:17.920 align:start position:0%
from gtown the other office is vacant
 
00:10:21.470 --> 00:10:21.480 align:start position:0%
business of financial Community vacant
 
00:10:25.150 --> 00:10:25.160 align:start position:0%
so how are we having this Council direct
 
00:10:27.470 --> 00:10:27.480 align:start position:0%
this process when it is not
 
00:10:32.430 --> 00:10:32.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:34.470 --> 00:10:34.480 align:start position:0%
topic it's certainly true that the
 
00:10:36.750 --> 00:10:36.760 align:start position:0%
council has suffered from vacancies for
 
00:10:38.949 --> 00:10:38.959 align:start position:0%
a number of years um I I couldn't I'm
 
00:10:41.910 --> 00:10:41.920 align:start position:0%
not going to offer an opinion on on that
 
00:10:43.710 --> 00:10:43.720 align:start position:0%
that the law is very clear that the
 
00:10:46.870 --> 00:10:46.880 align:start position:0%
council has a key um specific role in
 
00:10:48.949 --> 00:10:48.959 align:start position:0%
our rulemaking and we of course observe
 
00:10:50.750 --> 00:10:50.760 align:start position:0%
that role as we proceed with our
 
00:10:53.509 --> 00:10:53.519 align:start position:0%
rulemaking activities one question does
 
00:10:56.550 --> 00:10:56.560 align:start position:0%
de assign appoint or control who's on
 
00:10:58.430 --> 00:10:58.440 align:start position:0%
the council no those government those
 
00:10:59.949 --> 00:10:59.959 align:start position:0%
those appointments are made by the
 
00:11:02.550 --> 00:11:02.560 align:start position:0%
governor and Council okay and is Dees
 
00:11:05.150 --> 00:11:05.160 align:start position:0%
required to go to the council in its
 
00:11:06.990 --> 00:11:07.000 align:start position:0%
current format to get approval of what
 
00:11:10.069 --> 00:11:10.079 align:start position:0%
they do absolutely okay well and again
 
00:11:12.710 --> 00:11:12.720 align:start position:0%
approval is a strong word um they
 
00:11:14.829 --> 00:11:14.839 align:start position:0%
guidance guidance and feed the specific
 
00:11:16.509 --> 00:11:16.519 align:start position:0%
role is outlined very clearly in the
 
00:11:19.509 --> 00:11:19.519 align:start position:0%
statute and we we we are required to um
 
00:11:21.509 --> 00:11:21.519 align:start position:0%
you know the the most I think important
 
00:11:22.629 --> 00:11:22.639 align:start position:0%
thing is we know that whenever we're
 
00:11:24.590 --> 00:11:24.600 align:start position:0%
going to do a rulemaking the very first
 
00:11:26.629 --> 00:11:26.639 align:start position:0%
step in beginning that formal rulemaking
 
00:11:28.629 --> 00:11:28.639 align:start position:0%
process is presenting that initial
 
00:11:30.710 --> 00:11:30.720 align:start position:0%
proposal to the council but you do not
 
00:11:32.790 --> 00:11:32.800 align:start position:0%
control who's on the council we do not
 
00:11:34.590 --> 00:11:34.600 align:start position:0%
okay thank
 
00:11:37.110 --> 00:11:37.120 align:start position:0%
you representative H Haskins thank you
 
00:11:39.910 --> 00:11:39.920 align:start position:0%
very much good morning good morning
 
00:11:43.790 --> 00:11:43.800 align:start position:0%
so I don't know much about this and you
 
00:11:45.629 --> 00:11:45.639 align:start position:0%
know this is my first term so I'm
 
00:11:48.150 --> 00:11:48.160 align:start position:0%
learning how all the agencies work
 
00:11:52.670 --> 00:11:52.680 align:start position:0%
together but to representative penza's
 
00:11:56.430 --> 00:11:56.440 align:start position:0%
point this undermines public confidence
 
00:11:58.509 --> 00:11:58.519 align:start position:0%
and that's one of the issues that we're
 
00:12:01.030 --> 00:12:01.040 align:start position:0%
dealing with with the fact that these
 
00:12:04.030 --> 00:12:04.040 align:start position:0%
vacancies have happened over years and
 
00:12:05.550 --> 00:12:05.560 align:start position:0%
haven't been
 
00:12:08.430 --> 00:12:08.440 align:start position:0%
addressed puts the public in the back
 
00:12:12.790 --> 00:12:12.800 align:start position:0%
seat when it comes to how the process is
 
00:12:17.350 --> 00:12:17.360 align:start position:0%
set up and as we go forward and want to
 
00:12:22.509 --> 00:12:22.519 align:start position:0%
work together we represent the public so
 
00:12:25.189 --> 00:12:25.199 align:start position:0%
you can see why those vacancies for
 
00:12:28.629 --> 00:12:28.639 align:start position:0%
public health and for um whatever the
 
00:12:32.710 --> 00:12:32.720 align:start position:0%
other one was uh public interest public
 
00:12:35.470 --> 00:12:35.480 align:start position:0%
anything you can see why that undermines
 
00:12:38.910 --> 00:12:38.920 align:start position:0%
public confidence do you agree or do you
 
00:12:40.949 --> 00:12:40.959 align:start position:0%
understand I'm I understand your remarks
 
00:12:42.470 --> 00:12:42.480 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to comment or disparage
 
00:12:44.430 --> 00:12:44.440 align:start position:0%
the the council as is currently comp
 
00:12:46.350 --> 00:12:46.360 align:start position:0%
well yeah I don't intend to disparage
 
00:12:49.310 --> 00:12:49.320 align:start position:0%
them I just intend to reference the fact
 
00:12:52.470 --> 00:12:52.480 align:start position:0%
that this is the result and so as we go
 
00:12:56.189 --> 00:12:56.199 align:start position:0%
forward representing the public we want
 
00:13:00.550 --> 00:13:00.560 align:start position:0%
their voices through us to be heard
 
00:13:03.389 --> 00:13:03.399 align:start position:0%
okay so let me let me propose this so
 
00:13:04.389 --> 00:13:04.399 align:start position:0%
first of
 
00:13:06.990 --> 00:13:07.000 align:start position:0%
all Mr wimon has nothing to do with the
 
00:13:09.310 --> 00:13:09.320 align:start position:0%
way Council rather than he reps to them
 
00:13:10.710 --> 00:13:10.720 align:start position:0%
well but that this whole line of
 
00:13:13.470 --> 00:13:13.480 align:start position:0%
discussion what I would recommend is
 
00:13:15.990 --> 00:13:16.000 align:start position:0%
that we allow de to go through the
 
00:13:17.350 --> 00:13:17.360 align:start position:0%
questions that we
 
00:13:19.590 --> 00:13:19.600 align:start position:0%
asked once we go through those we only
 
00:13:21.389 --> 00:13:21.399 align:start position:0%
have 50 minutes left before we have
 
00:13:21.399 --> 00:13:22.750 align:start position:0%
have 50 minutes left before we have
another

00:13:22.750 --> 00:13:22.760 align:start position:0%
another
 
00:13:25.110 --> 00:13:25.120 align:start position:0%
session and so if we can allow them to
 
00:13:27.550 --> 00:13:27.560 align:start position:0%
go through that and then we'll pursue
 
00:13:29.470 --> 00:13:29.480 align:start position:0%
questions from there cuz we could talk
 
00:13:31.389 --> 00:13:31.399 align:start position:0%
around this for next 50 minutes and get
 
00:13:33.509 --> 00:13:33.519 align:start position:0%
nothing done but it but I'm not going to
 
00:13:35.750 --> 00:13:35.760 align:start position:0%
talk about the specifically with the
 
00:13:38.110 --> 00:13:38.120 align:start position:0%
council he he made reference to the
 
00:13:39.949 --> 00:13:39.959 align:start position:0%
council he made reference to going to
 
00:13:41.750 --> 00:13:41.760 align:start position:0%
the council saying that the rules were
 
00:13:43.870 --> 00:13:43.880 align:start position:0%
too restrictive and then they weakened
 
00:13:46.829 --> 00:13:46.839 align:start position:0%
the rules and so that that's the line of
 
00:13:48.790 --> 00:13:48.800 align:start position:0%
questioning I want to move forward on
 
00:13:50.150 --> 00:13:50.160 align:start position:0%
that I don't need to we don't need to
 
00:13:52.389 --> 00:13:52.399 align:start position:0%
beat a dead horse about the council I I
 
00:13:55.230 --> 00:13:55.240 align:start position:0%
think then he proceeded to say about you
 
00:13:56.870 --> 00:13:56.880 align:start position:0%
know with protection and all these types
 
00:13:59.189 --> 00:13:59.199 align:start position:0%
of things my next line of question
 
00:14:01.550 --> 00:14:01.560 align:start position:0%
literally has to do with the ru the
 
00:14:03.990 --> 00:14:04.000 align:start position:0%
rules being weakened okay well those are
 
00:14:06.069 --> 00:14:06.079 align:start position:0%
the questions we ask them in the form
 
00:14:08.710 --> 00:14:08.720 align:start position:0%
very spec very specifically and so let
 
00:14:10.389 --> 00:14:10.399 align:start position:0%
them answer the questions okay and then
 
00:14:11.910 --> 00:14:11.920 align:start position:0%
we'll see where we go from there okay
 
00:14:13.350 --> 00:14:13.360 align:start position:0%
because we've asked those
 
00:14:16.910 --> 00:14:16.920 align:start position:0%
questions sir over to you thank you Mr
 
00:14:19.269 --> 00:14:19.279 align:start position:0%
chair uh so when we appeared before the
 
00:14:21.150 --> 00:14:21.160 align:start position:0%
subcommittee back in October members
 
00:14:22.710 --> 00:14:22.720 align:start position:0%
expressed an interest in providing a
 
00:14:25.030 --> 00:14:25.040 align:start position:0%
list of questions as I indicated earlier
 
00:14:26.990 --> 00:14:27.000 align:start position:0%
uh we did receive those questions um
 
00:14:29.870 --> 00:14:29.880 align:start position:0%
last Friday and um we've reviewed them
 
00:14:31.310 --> 00:14:31.320 align:start position:0%
and in order to address them in a
 
00:14:33.030 --> 00:14:33.040 align:start position:0%
holistic fashion we kind of grouped and
 
00:14:34.670 --> 00:14:34.680 align:start position:0%
organized them under several topic
 
00:14:37.509 --> 00:14:37.519 align:start position:0%
headings which we'll address now um and
 
00:14:39.990 --> 00:14:40.000 align:start position:0%
then certainly be willing to field any
 
00:14:42.389 --> 00:14:42.399 align:start position:0%
questions that follow the first uh
 
00:14:44.189 --> 00:14:44.199 align:start position:0%
category was really just an individual
 
00:14:46.509 --> 00:14:46.519 align:start position:0%
question regarding uh requirements for
 
00:14:48.870 --> 00:14:48.880 align:start position:0%
municipal notification in the event of
 
00:14:51.269 --> 00:14:51.279 align:start position:0%
some kind of a incident or release at a
 
00:14:54.269 --> 00:14:54.279 align:start position:0%
landfill and um uh there are certain
 
00:14:56.509 --> 00:14:56.519 align:start position:0%
notifications of applications that you
 
00:14:57.590 --> 00:14:57.600 align:start position:0%
know that need to be made to
 
00:14:59.189 --> 00:14:59.199 align:start position:0%
municipalities regarding the filing of
 
00:15:01.230 --> 00:15:01.240 align:start position:0%
applications and such but there's
 
00:15:02.949 --> 00:15:02.959 align:start position:0%
currently no specific requirement in the
 
00:15:04.990 --> 00:15:05.000 align:start position:0%
rule to notify municipalities of
 
00:15:07.590 --> 00:15:07.600 align:start position:0%
incidents um the rules that regard
 
00:15:09.710 --> 00:15:09.720 align:start position:0%
incident notification at any solid waste
 
00:15:11.389 --> 00:15:11.399 align:start position:0%
facility be it a landfill or another
 
00:15:14.069 --> 00:15:14.079 align:start position:0%
type are embodied in chapter 1000 which
 
00:15:16.550 --> 00:15:16.560 align:start position:0%
is a rule making we've already completed
 
00:15:19.030 --> 00:15:19.040 align:start position:0%
however um we think it it's it's a fair
 
00:15:20.350 --> 00:15:20.360 align:start position:0%
question we think it's something that we
 
00:15:22.629 --> 00:15:22.639 align:start position:0%
could address in future revisions to
 
00:15:25.629 --> 00:15:25.639 align:start position:0%
1,000 1,000 doesn't expire for 10 years
 
00:15:26.829 --> 00:15:26.839 align:start position:0%
but that doesn't mean we can't start
 
00:15:28.949 --> 00:15:28.959 align:start position:0%
rulemaking on it next year or next week
 
00:15:31.470 --> 00:15:31.480 align:start position:0%
it's we we we often go in we don't you
 
00:15:35.749 --> 00:15:35.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:38.470 --> 00:15:38.480 align:start position:0%
readopm in between that time to make
 
00:15:40.110 --> 00:15:40.120 align:start position:0%
desired changes so that's something that
 
00:15:42.710 --> 00:15:42.720 align:start position:0%
we would consider in the meantime Dees
 
00:15:45.230 --> 00:15:45.240 align:start position:0%
will include provision for notification
 
00:15:47.309 --> 00:15:47.319 align:start position:0%
municipalities um about incidents
 
00:15:49.110 --> 00:15:49.120 align:start position:0%
release incidents and copying them on
 
00:15:50.590 --> 00:15:50.600 align:start position:0%
correspondence related to those
 
00:15:52.990 --> 00:15:53.000 align:start position:0%
incidents in our operating procedures so
 
00:15:54.309 --> 00:15:54.319 align:start position:0%
that's something that you know I think
 
00:15:56.590 --> 00:15:56.600 align:start position:0%
we can make happen in the absence of of
 
00:16:00.590 --> 00:16:00.600 align:start position:0%
an immediate rule change um the second
 
00:16:03.670 --> 00:16:03.680 align:start position:0%
cat take one at a time sure absolutely
 
00:16:04.949 --> 00:16:04.959 align:start position:0%
it's a pleasure of the committee
 
00:16:07.910 --> 00:16:07.920 align:start position:0%
absolutely go ahead thank you Mr chair
 
00:16:09.430 --> 00:16:09.440 align:start position:0%
and and thank you for that I I do
 
00:16:12.069 --> 00:16:12.079 align:start position:0%
appreciate the Insight around um you
 
00:16:16.389 --> 00:16:16.399 align:start position:0%
know guidance um do you anticipate going
 
00:16:19.230 --> 00:16:19.240 align:start position:0%
through Jael car and requesting an
 
00:16:22.110 --> 00:16:22.120 align:start position:0%
administrative rule change preemptively
 
00:16:24.309 --> 00:16:24.319 align:start position:0%
within the 10
 
00:16:27.069 --> 00:16:27.079 align:start position:0%
years I mean I I think possibility it's
 
00:16:29.350 --> 00:16:29.360 align:start position:0%
fair to say that we are engaged in Ru
 
00:16:31.189 --> 00:16:31.199 align:start position:0%
making on a pretty full-time basis I
 
00:16:33.629 --> 00:16:33.639 align:start position:0%
mean we we if we were to only amend our
 
00:16:35.790 --> 00:16:35.800 align:start position:0%
rules every 10 years um there would be a
 
00:16:37.269 --> 00:16:37.279 align:start position:0%
lot of things that would be left undone
 
00:16:39.030 --> 00:16:39.040 align:start position:0%
we often receive directives from the
 
00:16:41.230 --> 00:16:41.240 align:start position:0%
legislature to address certain things so
 
00:16:43.710 --> 00:16:43.720 align:start position:0%
we go to rule making for those things um
 
00:16:45.790 --> 00:16:45.800 align:start position:0%
and and we will be we will undoubtedly
 
00:16:48.110 --> 00:16:48.120 align:start position:0%
be doing additional rulemakings in the
 
00:16:51.069 --> 00:16:51.079 align:start position:0%
coming months and years um regarding uh
 
00:16:53.230 --> 00:16:53.240 align:start position:0%
you know outside the need the need to
 
00:16:55.710 --> 00:16:55.720 align:start position:0%
reopt um so we'll have an opportunity to
 
00:16:57.790 --> 00:16:57.800 align:start position:0%
do that and I think that's a fair
 
00:17:01.069 --> 00:17:01.079 align:start position:0%
request okay thank you uh the second
 
00:17:02.749 --> 00:17:02.759 align:start position:0%
category is regarding sighting
 
00:17:04.949 --> 00:17:04.959 align:start position:0%
stringency and uh the subcommittee had
 
00:17:06.750 --> 00:17:06.760 align:start position:0%
requested a demonstration that the
 
00:17:08.949 --> 00:17:08.959 align:start position:0%
proposed sighting rules um to
 
00:17:10.429 --> 00:17:10.439 align:start position:0%
demonstrate that the arguments by the
 
00:17:11.710 --> 00:17:11.720 align:start position:0%
industry that the rules are too
 
00:17:13.949 --> 00:17:13.959 align:start position:0%
stringent and excessively eliminate
 
00:17:16.350 --> 00:17:16.360 align:start position:0%
sites from consideration um you know to
 
00:17:19.350 --> 00:17:19.360 align:start position:0%
provide some proof of that um as as
 
00:17:20.949 --> 00:17:20.959 align:start position:0%
we've noted the industry has expressed
 
00:17:22.590 --> 00:17:22.600 align:start position:0%
concerns that the proposed sighting
 
00:17:24.750 --> 00:17:24.760 align:start position:0%
criteria are so stringent as to
 
00:17:26.669 --> 00:17:26.679 align:start position:0%
effectively eliminate most potential
 
00:17:29.150 --> 00:17:29.160 align:start position:0%
future landfill sites and potential
 
00:17:31.270 --> 00:17:31.280 align:start position:0%
areas of expansion of existing landfill
 
00:17:34.230 --> 00:17:34.240 align:start position:0%
sites from eligibility and again the
 
00:17:35.789 --> 00:17:35.799 align:start position:0%
committee has asked for for proof of
 
00:17:38.669 --> 00:17:38.679 align:start position:0%
that um I have to say it's unlikely we
 
00:17:40.630 --> 00:17:40.640 align:start position:0%
would be able to obtain a document or
 
00:17:43.029 --> 00:17:43.039 align:start position:0%
documents that would Pro provide the
 
00:17:45.590 --> 00:17:45.600 align:start position:0%
desired level of proof um it's also been
 
00:17:46.870 --> 00:17:46.880 align:start position:0%
requested I think one of the things that
 
00:17:48.510 --> 00:17:48.520 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee asked for was a map
 
00:17:51.270 --> 00:17:51.280 align:start position:0%
showing what sites in the state would be
 
00:17:53.470 --> 00:17:53.480 align:start position:0%
ineligible as a result of the rules that
 
00:17:57.350 --> 00:17:57.360 align:start position:0%
are being proposed um and um I don't
 
00:17:59.070 --> 00:17:59.080 align:start position:0%
believe anyone is going to be able to
 
00:18:00.870 --> 00:18:00.880 align:start position:0%
produce such a map we certainly don't
 
00:18:03.110 --> 00:18:03.120 align:start position:0%
have that um in our discussions with
 
00:18:04.310 --> 00:18:04.320 align:start position:0%
members of the industry they have
 
00:18:05.789 --> 00:18:05.799 align:start position:0%
indicated that they have conducted
 
00:18:08.029 --> 00:18:08.039 align:start position:0%
reviews of available sites and have
 
00:18:09.789 --> 00:18:09.799 align:start position:0%
concluded that there already exist very
 
00:18:12.350 --> 00:18:12.360 align:start position:0%
few eligible sites even under existing
 
00:18:15.149 --> 00:18:15.159 align:start position:0%
sighting criteria um Dees does not
 
00:18:17.230 --> 00:18:17.240 align:start position:0%
possess any of these data reports
 
00:18:19.029 --> 00:18:19.039 align:start position:0%
they're they're not public documents and
 
00:18:20.430 --> 00:18:20.440 align:start position:0%
the industry is not offered to share
 
00:18:23.549 --> 00:18:23.559 align:start position:0%
them with us um we're aware that many
 
00:18:25.430 --> 00:18:25.440 align:start position:0%
different site criteria must be met for
 
00:18:28.029 --> 00:18:28.039 align:start position:0%
a given parcel to be practicable for to
 
00:18:30.750 --> 00:18:30.760 align:start position:0%
site landfill these include uh among
 
00:18:32.350 --> 00:18:32.360 align:start position:0%
other things Geographic size and
 
00:18:35.630 --> 00:18:35.640 align:start position:0%
location permissible zoning proximity to
 
00:18:37.750 --> 00:18:37.760 align:start position:0%
adequate Transportation routes
 
00:18:39.669 --> 00:18:39.679 align:start position:0%
availability and proximity of suitable
 
00:18:41.390 --> 00:18:41.400 align:start position:0%
Aggregate and and Sand and Gravel
 
00:18:43.950 --> 00:18:43.960 align:start position:0%
materials conformance with Dees sighting
 
00:18:46.230 --> 00:18:46.240 align:start position:0%
criteria relative to Wetlands surface
 
00:18:48.029 --> 00:18:48.039 align:start position:0%
water drinking water sources and
 
00:18:50.830 --> 00:18:50.840 align:start position:0%
neighboring features and land uses as
 
00:18:53.070 --> 00:18:53.080 align:start position:0%
well as of course the site geology and
 
00:18:55.029 --> 00:18:55.039 align:start position:0%
when all these criteria can be met the
 
00:18:56.630 --> 00:18:56.640 align:start position:0%
site must also be available for
 
00:18:59.270 --> 00:18:59.280 align:start position:0%
acquisition by the by the by the by the
 
00:19:01.110 --> 00:19:01.120 align:start position:0%
person who's interested in citing a
 
00:19:02.950 --> 00:19:02.960 align:start position:0%
landfill so you can imagine that it's
 
00:19:05.029 --> 00:19:05.039 align:start position:0%
not easy to find a site that checks all
 
00:19:08.390 --> 00:19:08.400 align:start position:0%
those boxes um the concerns expressed
 
00:19:10.390 --> 00:19:10.400 align:start position:0%
Center largely on observations by the
 
00:19:12.710 --> 00:19:12.720 align:start position:0%
industry that the geology of the large
 
00:19:15.110 --> 00:19:15.120 align:start position:0%
sites needed for landfills is unlikely
 
00:19:17.310 --> 00:19:17.320 align:start position:0%
to be 100% homogeneous it's not going to
 
00:19:20.390 --> 00:19:20.400 align:start position:0%
be all um consistent and that as
 
00:19:22.110 --> 00:19:22.120 align:start position:0%
originally proposed the rules that the
 
00:19:24.950 --> 00:19:24.960 align:start position:0%
agency proposed um that specifi site
 
00:19:27.470 --> 00:19:27.480 align:start position:0%
soil conditions were so stringent as to
 
00:19:29.390 --> 00:19:29.400 align:start position:0%
effectively elim minate most potential
 
00:19:32.149 --> 00:19:32.159 align:start position:0%
landfill sites and preclude expansion of
 
00:19:35.230 --> 00:19:35.240 align:start position:0%
our existing landfill sites um while we
 
00:19:37.029 --> 00:19:37.039 align:start position:0%
don't possess the specific reports on
 
00:19:39.669 --> 00:19:39.679 align:start position:0%
this topic or a map uh we do employ at
 
00:19:41.830 --> 00:19:41.840 align:start position:0%
least 25 experienced hydrogeologists
 
00:19:43.510 --> 00:19:43.520 align:start position:0%
whose Collective knowledge and field
 
00:19:45.669 --> 00:19:45.679 align:start position:0%
experience support the assertion that
 
00:19:48.230 --> 00:19:48.240 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's geology is heterogeneous
 
00:19:49.470 --> 00:19:49.480 align:start position:0%
uh during their careers these
 
00:19:51.230 --> 00:19:51.240 align:start position:0%
professionals have sat on drill Rigs and
 
00:19:54.230 --> 00:19:54.240 align:start position:0%
logged countless borings into the into
 
00:19:56.669 --> 00:19:56.679 align:start position:0%
the Earth that demonstrate this in
 
00:19:58.789 --> 00:19:58.799 align:start position:0%
addition in their work at Dees
 
00:20:00.630 --> 00:20:00.640 align:start position:0%
these staff collectively review hundreds
 
00:20:03.110 --> 00:20:03.120 align:start position:0%
of site assessment reports and boring
 
00:20:05.630 --> 00:20:05.640 align:start position:0%
logs each year that confirm that the
 
00:20:07.669 --> 00:20:07.679 align:start position:0%
geology of most sites even on a small
 
00:20:10.710 --> 00:20:10.720 align:start position:0%
scale was not homogeneous so this uh the
 
00:20:12.430 --> 00:20:12.440 align:start position:0%
concern is that the way that we
 
00:20:14.549 --> 00:20:14.559 align:start position:0%
originally proposed the
 
00:20:17.070 --> 00:20:17.080 align:start position:0%
rules you know read in their strictest
 
00:20:19.789 --> 00:20:19.799 align:start position:0%
context um they would basically create a
 
00:20:21.149 --> 00:20:21.159 align:start position:0%
situation where even the existing
 
00:20:23.149 --> 00:20:23.159 align:start position:0%
landfills that have been cited and have
 
00:20:25.630 --> 00:20:25.640 align:start position:0%
been operating safely um would not be
 
00:20:26.909 --> 00:20:26.919 align:start position:0%
able to expand because they wouldn't
 
00:20:29.669 --> 00:20:29.679 align:start position:0%
meet those requirements so we um this is
 
00:20:31.630 --> 00:20:31.640 align:start position:0%
an area where we realized we probably
 
00:20:34.070 --> 00:20:34.080 align:start position:0%
overshot the runway a little bit um you
 
00:20:36.510 --> 00:20:36.520 align:start position:0%
know no no ill intent in any direction
 
00:20:39.390 --> 00:20:39.400 align:start position:0%
on our part but um we we did go back and
 
00:20:41.110 --> 00:20:41.120 align:start position:0%
look at that and try to determine what
 
00:20:43.230 --> 00:20:43.240 align:start position:0%
would be continue to be a protective
 
00:20:44.909 --> 00:20:44.919 align:start position:0%
standard that would not kind of break
 
00:20:47.470 --> 00:20:47.480 align:start position:0%
the system if you will so that's how how
 
00:20:48.990 --> 00:20:49.000 align:start position:0%
we address
 
00:20:52.190 --> 00:20:52.200 align:start position:0%
that represent
 
00:20:55.390 --> 00:20:55.400 align:start position:0%
Penza okay so let's go to that let's go
 
00:20:58.510 --> 00:20:58.520 align:start position:0%
to the protective standard so on January
 
00:21:02.510 --> 00:21:02.520 align:start position:0%
31st we brought up how Maine has um
 
00:21:05.830 --> 00:21:05.840 align:start position:0%
their landfill sightings is 10 to the5
 
00:21:07.630 --> 00:21:07.640 align:start position:0%
um quoting you from that you said I
 
00:21:09.430 --> 00:21:09.440 align:start position:0%
would seriously doubt that landfills
 
00:21:11.510 --> 00:21:11.520 align:start position:0%
cited and operate in Maine right now
 
00:21:14.190 --> 00:21:14.200 align:start position:0%
meet a 10 to the five standard I mean
 
00:21:17.909 --> 00:21:17.919 align:start position:0%
it's very unlikely that's your quote so
 
00:21:21.549 --> 00:21:21.559 align:start position:0%
um this is specifically from Maine if
 
00:21:24.549 --> 00:21:24.559 align:start position:0%
you'd like to know their Criterion um
 
00:21:28.710 --> 00:21:28.720 align:start position:0%
it's 10 to the5 I can give you their um
 
00:21:31.590 --> 00:21:31.600 align:start position:0%
you know hydraulic conductivity D all of
 
00:21:34.710 --> 00:21:34.720 align:start position:0%
that so and they have an active landfill
 
00:21:35.950 --> 00:21:35.960 align:start position:0%
from the same person that you have a
 
00:21:38.350 --> 00:21:38.360 align:start position:0%
permanent right now that is working
 
00:21:41.830 --> 00:21:41.840 align:start position:0%
underneath those um those Criterion so
 
00:21:43.950 --> 00:21:43.960 align:start position:0%
we have a neighboring state that's that
 
00:21:48.110 --> 00:21:48.120 align:start position:0%
how about let's go to um Mississippi
 
00:21:52.149 --> 00:21:52.159 align:start position:0%
they're 110 to the6 Vermont 110 to the4
 
00:21:54.110 --> 00:21:54.120 align:start position:0%
but there's a ton of Criterion in there
 
00:22:00.269 --> 00:22:00.279 align:start position:0%
Arkansas 110 to the7 Colorado 110 --6
 
00:22:05.149 --> 00:22:05.159 align:start position:0%
Missouri 1105 Ohio 110 the5 California
 
00:22:08.269 --> 00:22:08.279 align:start position:0%
110 the6 I can go on and on but you're
 
00:22:11.230 --> 00:22:11.240 align:start position:0%
getting the idea we are actually going
 
00:22:14.510 --> 00:22:14.520 align:start position:0%
down a road of making us um in a sense
 
00:22:18.990 --> 00:22:19.000 align:start position:0%
kind of the dumbest state for for um for
 
00:22:23.070 --> 00:22:23.080 align:start position:0%
our 10 in the neg3 so it just doesn't
 
00:22:25.909 --> 00:22:25.919 align:start position:0%
make sense if you look at the change the
 
00:22:28.470 --> 00:22:28.480 align:start position:0%
last change in the rules is about
 
00:22:32.990 --> 00:22:33.000 align:start position:0%
500 times weaker than the one prior to
 
00:22:36.149 --> 00:22:36.159 align:start position:0%
if you look at um the landfill in Berlin
 
00:22:40.029 --> 00:22:40.039 align:start position:0%
which is on Clay they are right now at
 
00:22:43.149 --> 00:22:43.159 align:start position:0%
uh conductivity of about one foot per
 
00:22:46.070 --> 00:22:46.080 align:start position:0%
year based upon the rules right now it
 
00:22:48.909 --> 00:22:48.919 align:start position:0%
would be 15 feet per day and then
 
00:22:51.029 --> 00:22:51.039 align:start position:0%
because we put the average in there it
 
00:22:52.830 --> 00:22:52.840 align:start position:0%
could be a certain part of the landfill
 
00:22:56.190 --> 00:22:56.200 align:start position:0%
could be almost 100 feet 150 feet per
 
00:22:58.710 --> 00:22:58.720 align:start position:0%
day that's what we're looking at there's
 
00:23:02.549 --> 00:23:02.559 align:start position:0%
no way in in any explanation that you
 
00:23:05.029 --> 00:23:05.039 align:start position:0%
could say that 10 to the neg3 is
 
00:23:08.669 --> 00:23:08.679 align:start position:0%
protective at all I don't understand
 
00:23:08.679 --> 00:23:10.830 align:start position:0%
protective at all I don't understand
this

00:23:10.830 --> 00:23:10.840 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:23:13.789 --> 00:23:13.799 align:start position:0%
so This touches on another area one of
 
00:23:15.350 --> 00:23:15.360 align:start position:0%
the area groupings that we had was the
 
00:23:17.590 --> 00:23:17.600 align:start position:0%
comparison to other states rules and I I
 
00:23:18.750 --> 00:23:18.760 align:start position:0%
would like to say a little bit about
 
00:23:19.909 --> 00:23:19.919 align:start position:0%
that and then we could talk more
 
00:23:22.909 --> 00:23:22.919 align:start position:0%
specifically to your questions um the
 
00:23:25.070 --> 00:23:25.080 align:start position:0%
com the committee has expressed concerns
 
00:23:26.750 --> 00:23:26.760 align:start position:0%
and specifically that the rules don't
 
00:23:29.470 --> 00:23:29.480 align:start position:0%
align with the state of mains rules and
 
00:23:31.510 --> 00:23:31.520 align:start position:0%
uh as we've expressed in Prior meetings
 
00:23:32.789 --> 00:23:32.799 align:start position:0%
um we don't believe that direct
 
00:23:34.950 --> 00:23:34.960 align:start position:0%
comparison to other states rules is
 
00:23:36.750 --> 00:23:36.760 align:start position:0%
appropriate or or productive for a
 
00:23:39.430 --> 00:23:39.440 align:start position:0%
couple of key reasons first other states
 
00:23:41.789 --> 00:23:41.799 align:start position:0%
law and policy directives are different
 
00:23:43.350 --> 00:23:43.360 align:start position:0%
all states administrative rules are
 
00:23:45.750 --> 00:23:45.760 align:start position:0%
derived from enabling state laws that
 
00:23:47.510 --> 00:23:47.520 align:start position:0%
Grant rulle making Authority and shape
 
00:23:49.909 --> 00:23:49.919 align:start position:0%
the nature and content of those rules
 
00:23:51.390 --> 00:23:51.400 align:start position:0%
without an understanding of the state
 
00:23:54.070 --> 00:23:54.080 align:start position:0%
specific legislative policy directives a
 
00:23:56.029 --> 00:23:56.039 align:start position:0%
direct comparison of specific rules is
 
00:23:58.470 --> 00:23:58.480 align:start position:0%
not meaningful for example the states of
 
00:23:59.830 --> 00:23:59.840 align:start position:0%
Connecticut and Massachusetts have
 
00:24:01.950 --> 00:24:01.960 align:start position:0%
implemented policies that have made
 
00:24:03.789 --> 00:24:03.799 align:start position:0%
development and operation of instate
 
00:24:06.110 --> 00:24:06.120 align:start position:0%
Solid Waste facilities so difficult that
 
00:24:08.310 --> 00:24:08.320 align:start position:0%
each state now lacks capacity for much
 
00:24:11.070 --> 00:24:11.080 align:start position:0%
if not all of its waste and consequently
 
00:24:13.070 --> 00:24:13.080 align:start position:0%
those states must rely on extensive use
 
00:24:15.630 --> 00:24:15.640 align:start position:0%
of out ofate facilities for disposal of
 
00:24:17.909 --> 00:24:17.919 align:start position:0%
their own waste New Hampshire law does
 
00:24:20.070 --> 00:24:20.080 align:start position:0%
not provide such a directive on the
 
00:24:23.149 --> 00:24:23.159 align:start position:0%
contrary it uh explicitly directs and
 
00:24:25.070 --> 00:24:25.080 align:start position:0%
this is a quote from the statute that we
 
00:24:26.950 --> 00:24:26.960 align:start position:0%
must ensure that adequate capacity
 
00:24:29.070 --> 00:24:29.080 align:start position:0%
exists within the state to accommodate
 
00:24:31.149 --> 00:24:31.159 align:start position:0%
the solid waste generators generated
 
00:24:33.750 --> 00:24:33.760 align:start position:0%
within the borders of the state now the
 
00:24:35.669 --> 00:24:35.679 align:start position:0%
second reason is that even if you assume
 
00:24:37.750 --> 00:24:37.760 align:start position:0%
that an overarch the overarching policy
 
00:24:39.789 --> 00:24:39.799 align:start position:0%
directives are aligned between two
 
00:24:42.630 --> 00:24:42.640 align:start position:0%
states uh a fair comparison between spe
 
00:24:45.190 --> 00:24:45.200 align:start position:0%
two specific rules cannot be made that
 
00:24:47.870 --> 00:24:47.880 align:start position:0%
is the comparison is Apples oranges and
 
00:24:49.590 --> 00:24:49.600 align:start position:0%
I think this goes to a lot of the
 
00:24:50.950 --> 00:24:50.960 align:start position:0%
statistics that you just read
 
00:24:53.310 --> 00:24:53.320 align:start position:0%
representative Potenza so when reviewing
 
00:24:55.389 --> 00:24:55.399 align:start position:0%
other states rules individual Provisions
 
00:24:57.070 --> 00:24:57.080 align:start position:0%
have to be taken in the context of the
 
00:24:59.310 --> 00:24:59.320 align:start position:0%
entire rule framework which requires
 
00:25:00.909 --> 00:25:00.919 align:start position:0%
significant experience with a particular
 
00:25:03.510 --> 00:25:03.520 align:start position:0%
rule set our experience with this as
 
00:25:05.350 --> 00:25:05.360 align:start position:0%
prompted by several prior comparisons
 
00:25:07.549 --> 00:25:07.559 align:start position:0%
with the state of Main's rules have
 
00:25:10.310 --> 00:25:10.320 align:start position:0%
Illustrated this issues this issue when
 
00:25:12.870 --> 00:25:12.880 align:start position:0%
we attempt to dig into the details uh we
 
00:25:14.510 --> 00:25:14.520 align:start position:0%
find that the context for how the rule
 
00:25:15.950 --> 00:25:15.960 align:start position:0%
is implemented within that State's
 
00:25:18.269 --> 00:25:18.279 align:start position:0%
framework indicates that it cannot be
 
00:25:20.110 --> 00:25:20.120 align:start position:0%
directly compared with a seemingly
 
00:25:22.350 --> 00:25:22.360 align:start position:0%
analogous New Hampshire rule so
 
00:25:24.190 --> 00:25:24.200 align:start position:0%
accordingly we're not inclined to engage
 
00:25:27.110 --> 00:25:27.120 align:start position:0%
in specific debate on this topic because
 
00:25:28.549 --> 00:25:28.559 align:start position:0%
we don't possess an in-depth knowledge
 
00:25:30.590 --> 00:25:30.600 align:start position:0%
of other state rule sets and it's
 
00:25:33.710 --> 00:25:33.720 align:start position:0%
neither productive nor helpful now
 
00:25:35.870 --> 00:25:35.880 align:start position:0%
specifically to the to the hydraulic
 
00:25:38.190 --> 00:25:38.200 align:start position:0%
conductivities that you just cited
 
00:25:40.269 --> 00:25:40.279 align:start position:0%
without a very specific understanding of
 
00:25:43.149 --> 00:25:43.159 align:start position:0%
what is being required there which soils
 
00:25:45.389 --> 00:25:45.399 align:start position:0%
are being referenced and also what the
 
00:25:47.230 --> 00:25:47.240 align:start position:0%
liner requirements are a lot of states
 
00:25:50.350 --> 00:25:50.360 align:start position:0%
that may have a 10 Theus 6 or a 10us 7th
 
00:25:53.830 --> 00:25:53.840 align:start position:0%
requirement are basically talking about
 
00:25:55.830 --> 00:25:55.840 align:start position:0%
in many cases a single line facility
 
00:25:57.669 --> 00:25:57.679 align:start position:0%
that's required to have a clay layer and
 
00:25:59.590 --> 00:25:59.600 align:start position:0%
natural or or or an imp placed clay
 
00:26:02.789 --> 00:26:02.799 align:start position:0%
layer beneath it that is a way to to
 
00:26:04.389 --> 00:26:04.399 align:start position:0%
construct the landfill and that kind of
 
00:26:06.310 --> 00:26:06.320 align:start position:0%
a landfill can be constructed in New
 
00:26:09.310 --> 00:26:09.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but um what we encourage and
 
00:26:11.590 --> 00:26:11.600 align:start position:0%
what our rules encourage is that we use
 
00:26:14.070 --> 00:26:14.080 align:start position:0%
the most sophisticated engineered
 
00:26:16.590 --> 00:26:16.600 align:start position:0%
systems for these facilities as possible
 
00:26:18.750 --> 00:26:18.760 align:start position:0%
and that's what the industry without
 
00:26:21.389 --> 00:26:21.399 align:start position:0%
exception has elected to do and they
 
00:26:24.110 --> 00:26:24.120 align:start position:0%
construct double line systems engineered
 
00:26:25.950 --> 00:26:25.960 align:start position:0%
double line systems that have double
 
00:26:28.230 --> 00:26:28.240 align:start position:0%
line geosynthetic liners
 
00:26:31.430 --> 00:26:31.440 align:start position:0%
um that uh basically we believe and and
 
00:26:33.630 --> 00:26:33.640 align:start position:0%
the industry I think is born out provide
 
00:26:35.990 --> 00:26:36.000 align:start position:0%
a much Superior level of protection
 
00:26:38.669 --> 00:26:38.679 align:start position:0%
we're aware that these 10us 6 and 10us
 
00:26:41.430 --> 00:26:41.440 align:start position:0%
7th impl clay layers um while they may
 
00:26:46.029 --> 00:26:46.039 align:start position:0%
be um uh put in place and and appear to
 
00:26:47.669 --> 00:26:47.679 align:start position:0%
provide a significant level of
 
00:26:52.110 --> 00:26:52.120 align:start position:0%
protection um they also present very
 
00:26:54.669 --> 00:26:54.679 align:start position:0%
specific stability issues because those
 
00:26:56.269 --> 00:26:56.279 align:start position:0%
kinds of soils while they have low
 
00:26:58.029 --> 00:26:58.039 align:start position:0%
hydraulic conductivity are not
 
00:27:00.510 --> 00:27:00.520 align:start position:0%
particularly you effective for for
 
00:27:03.789 --> 00:27:03.799 align:start position:0%
building on and even when they are done
 
00:27:06.310 --> 00:27:06.320 align:start position:0%
properly and and placed and remain
 
00:27:08.870 --> 00:27:08.880 align:start position:0%
stable they can develop cracks that can
 
00:27:10.350 --> 00:27:10.360 align:start position:0%
basically so you can imagine you have a
 
00:27:12.830 --> 00:27:12.840 align:start position:0%
very low conductivity layer of clay and
 
00:27:15.149 --> 00:27:15.159 align:start position:0%
then it develops desiccation cracks that
 
00:27:17.630 --> 00:27:17.640 align:start position:0%
provide a direct fracture route from a
 
00:27:19.750 --> 00:27:19.760 align:start position:0%
leak in the liner to in a single liner
 
00:27:23.070 --> 00:27:23.080 align:start position:0%
in many cases down to the formation so
 
00:27:25.149 --> 00:27:25.159 align:start position:0%
there are lots of reasons why those kind
 
00:27:26.789 --> 00:27:26.799 align:start position:0%
that's that's an example of why those
 
00:27:28.230 --> 00:27:28.240 align:start position:0%
kinds of comparison
 
00:27:30.070 --> 00:27:30.080 align:start position:0%
are not meaningful and again we we're
 
00:27:32.110 --> 00:27:32.120 align:start position:0%
going to be reluctant to engage in a
 
00:27:34.110 --> 00:27:34.120 align:start position:0%
state-by-state review because it's just
 
00:27:36.590 --> 00:27:36.600 align:start position:0%
not we we're we're expert in our rules
 
00:27:37.990 --> 00:27:38.000 align:start position:0%
and that's where it begins and ends we
 
00:27:41.549 --> 00:27:41.559 align:start position:0%
are not experts in any other State's
 
00:27:44.590 --> 00:27:44.600 align:start position:0%
rules um represent
 
00:27:46.590 --> 00:27:46.600 align:start position:0%
hton thank
 
00:27:50.070 --> 00:27:50.080 align:start position:0%
you I'm back to my public confidence
 
00:27:53.190 --> 00:27:53.200 align:start position:0%
because somehow this is the piece that I
 
00:27:57.110 --> 00:27:57.120 align:start position:0%
feel most strongly about pardon me so
 
00:28:00.909 --> 00:28:00.919 align:start position:0%
the industry says um they can't expand
 
00:28:04.149 --> 00:28:04.159 align:start position:0%
they can't build new sites unless they
 
00:28:06.509 --> 00:28:06.519 align:start position:0%
have what they
 
00:28:09.590 --> 00:28:09.600 align:start position:0%
want there's no evidence they don't give
 
00:28:11.950 --> 00:28:11.960 align:start position:0%
us any evidence there's
 
00:28:17.630 --> 00:28:17.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:20.389 --> 00:28:20.399 align:start position:0%
share how am I supposed to have how are
 
00:28:23.990 --> 00:28:24.000 align:start position:0%
we supposed to have confidence that
 
00:28:26.710 --> 00:28:26.720 align:start position:0%
other scientists who are weighing in and
 
00:28:29.549 --> 00:28:29.559 align:start position:0%
I think you know are um schooling some
 
00:28:29.559 --> 00:28:30.269 align:start position:0%
I think you know are um schooling some
of

00:28:30.269 --> 00:28:30.279 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:28:36.269 --> 00:28:36.279 align:start position:0%
us believe that citing a landfill in
 
00:28:39.430 --> 00:28:39.440 align:start position:0%
sand because there's a lot of sand
 
00:28:43.549 --> 00:28:43.559 align:start position:0%
available makes no sense and I I agree
 
00:28:46.430 --> 00:28:46.440 align:start position:0%
with everything rep Pensa said you know
 
00:28:50.190 --> 00:28:50.200 align:start position:0%
it's gotten from October to December to
 
00:28:52.990 --> 00:28:53.000 align:start position:0%
January weaker each
 
00:28:56.190 --> 00:28:56.200 align:start position:0%
time I don't feel good about that and as
 
00:28:58.430 --> 00:28:58.440 align:start position:0%
as I represent the people who want to
 
00:29:01.750 --> 00:29:01.760 align:start position:0%
know what I'm doing about it I have to
 
00:29:03.269 --> 00:29:03.279 align:start position:0%
register the fact that I think it's
 
00:29:08.110 --> 00:29:08.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:11.029 --> 00:29:11.039 align:start position:0%
rulemaking thank you um Mr chair and
 
00:29:12.350 --> 00:29:12.360 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my I'm sorry was
 
00:29:17.149 --> 00:29:17.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:20.389 --> 00:29:20.399 align:start position:0%
sorry um thank you Mr chair um thank you
 
00:29:23.350 --> 00:29:23.360 align:start position:0%
uh director whimet can you um speak to I
 
00:29:24.710 --> 00:29:24.720 align:start position:0%
I we've talked about it a couple of
 
00:29:27.389 --> 00:29:27.399 align:start position:0%
times with regard to site design
 
00:29:30.149 --> 00:29:30.159 align:start position:0%
tolerances versus Institue design
 
00:29:30.159 --> 00:29:31.750 align:start position:0%
tolerances versus Institue design
tolerances

00:29:31.750 --> 00:29:31.760 align:start position:0%
tolerances
 
00:29:31.760 --> 00:29:33.350 align:start position:0%
tolerances
and

00:29:33.350 --> 00:29:33.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:29:38.190 --> 00:29:38.200 align:start position:0%
why we have a discrepancy there in uh
 
00:29:42.509 --> 00:29:42.519 align:start position:0%
going with a less tolerant number in one
 
00:29:44.430 --> 00:29:44.440 align:start position:0%
circumstance versus another why are they
 
00:29:45.470 --> 00:29:45.480 align:start position:0%
not the
 
00:29:48.230 --> 00:29:48.240 align:start position:0%
same when you're looking at the
 
00:29:50.470 --> 00:29:50.480 align:start position:0%
tolerances yeah and I and actually I
 
00:29:51.990 --> 00:29:52.000 align:start position:0%
think it might be helpful if I review a
 
00:29:53.909 --> 00:29:53.919 align:start position:0%
few other sections because I touch on
 
00:29:55.350 --> 00:29:55.360 align:start position:0%
all of those things and then we can if
 
00:29:57.430 --> 00:29:57.440 align:start position:0%
you if I don't address it well you by by
 
00:30:01.230 --> 00:30:01.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:03.990 --> 00:30:04.000 align:start position:0%
me so I just want to be clear I'm not
 
00:30:07.070 --> 00:30:07.080 align:start position:0%
asking for you know New Hampshire to
 
00:30:10.190 --> 00:30:10.200 align:start position:0%
mirror other states I mean I think it's
 
00:30:13.870 --> 00:30:13.880 align:start position:0%
clear the original rules that came out
 
00:30:17.430 --> 00:30:17.440 align:start position:0%
that we have in place they're already a
 
00:30:20.149 --> 00:30:20.159 align:start position:0%
thousand times weaker at least than 10
 
00:30:23.950 --> 00:30:23.960 align:start position:0%
other states that are citing right now
 
00:30:26.789 --> 00:30:26.799 align:start position:0%
that's what I'm saying it's not about
 
00:30:29.350 --> 00:30:29.360 align:start position:0%
compar and this and land and all of that
 
00:30:31.990 --> 00:30:32.000 align:start position:0%
I mean we know the science is is is
 
00:30:34.230 --> 00:30:34.240 align:start position:0%
clear I like to ask the question how
 
00:30:35.750 --> 00:30:35.760 align:start position:0%
long have you been in the position that
 
00:30:39.029 --> 00:30:39.039 align:start position:0%
you've been in at Dees since 2007 okay
 
00:30:40.470 --> 00:30:40.480 align:start position:0%
have you done rules
 
00:30:42.909 --> 00:30:42.919 align:start position:0%
yet since you've been there have have
 
00:30:45.430 --> 00:30:45.440 align:start position:0%
you written rules we have implemented
 
00:30:48.630 --> 00:30:48.640 align:start position:0%
countless rules time citing land site
 
00:30:50.590 --> 00:30:50.600 align:start position:0%
rules representative Penza we're going
 
00:30:52.070 --> 00:30:52.080 align:start position:0%
to we're going to stick to the rules
 
00:30:54.070 --> 00:30:54.080 align:start position:0%
that they're this is about this isn't
 
00:30:55.470 --> 00:30:55.480 align:start position:0%
about resumes and everything it isn't
 
00:30:57.830 --> 00:30:57.840 align:start position:0%
about they asking we're not do it oh my
 
00:31:00.549 --> 00:31:00.559 align:start position:0%
gosh I'm just making a point have we
 
00:31:02.389 --> 00:31:02.399 align:start position:0%
haven't done this right because it these
 
00:31:04.110 --> 00:31:04.120 align:start position:0%
rules have been in place for what 19
 
00:31:05.629 --> 00:31:05.639 align:start position:0%
years 20
 
00:31:09.029 --> 00:31:09.039 align:start position:0%
years the rules were reopt 10 years ago
 
00:31:11.190 --> 00:31:11.200 align:start position:0%
10 years ago and there were changes made
 
00:31:13.269 --> 00:31:13.279 align:start position:0%
to the citing criteria correct but like
 
00:31:15.789 --> 00:31:15.799 align:start position:0%
this full whole process hasn't happened
 
00:31:18.029 --> 00:31:18.039 align:start position:0%
for they it's been in place for 20 years
 
00:31:18.039 --> 00:31:19.310 align:start position:0%
for they it's been in place for 20 years
right

00:31:19.310 --> 00:31:19.320 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:31:21.750 --> 00:31:21.760 align:start position:0%
1920 you have to look at each individual
 
00:31:23.950 --> 00:31:23.960 align:start position:0%
rules some rules are older some are
 
00:31:27.870 --> 00:31:27.880 align:start position:0%
newer again we we make changes to rules
 
00:31:30.029 --> 00:31:30.039 align:start position:0%
bit by bit in many cases I'm talking
 
00:31:31.789 --> 00:31:31.799 align:start position:0%
about citing
 
00:31:33.789 --> 00:31:33.799 align:start position:0%
landfills there have been changes to
 
00:31:35.669 --> 00:31:35.679 align:start position:0%
citing criteria that were made I believe
 
00:31:36.629 --> 00:31:36.639 align:start position:0%
back in the
 
00:31:42.190 --> 00:31:42.200 align:start position:0%
2014 um rule making okay thank
 
00:31:45.590 --> 00:31:45.600 align:start position:0%
you so um the next category that we had
 
00:31:47.190 --> 00:31:47.200 align:start position:0%
identified was um the citing
 
00:31:48.990 --> 00:31:49.000 align:start position:0%
requirements applicability and this this
 
00:31:51.190 --> 00:31:51.200 align:start position:0%
is a simple one so the subcommittee had
 
00:31:53.230 --> 00:31:53.240 align:start position:0%
Express concerns that citing
 
00:31:54.789 --> 00:31:54.799 align:start position:0%
requirements do not apply to the
 
00:31:57.590 --> 00:31:57.600 align:start position:0%
expansion of existing facilities and
 
00:31:58.950 --> 00:31:58.960 align:start position:0%
that's a misunderstanding of the
 
00:32:01.110 --> 00:32:01.120 align:start position:0%
proposed rules the sighting requirements
 
00:32:02.669 --> 00:32:02.679 align:start position:0%
while they're not retroactive to
 
00:32:05.110 --> 00:32:05.120 align:start position:0%
existing permited Footprints uh do
 
00:32:06.950 --> 00:32:06.960 align:start position:0%
indeed apply to the Future expansion of
 
00:32:06.960 --> 00:32:08.269 align:start position:0%
indeed apply to the Future expansion of
existing

00:32:08.269 --> 00:32:08.279 align:start position:0%
existing
 
00:32:11.149 --> 00:32:11.159 align:start position:0%
facilities um so then um moving on to
 
00:32:13.789 --> 00:32:13.799 align:start position:0%
the hydraulic cont conductivity of soils
 
00:32:16.070 --> 00:32:16.080 align:start position:0%
issue the subcommittee had expressed
 
00:32:17.549 --> 00:32:17.559 align:start position:0%
concerns regarding the requirements
 
00:32:19.830 --> 00:32:19.840 align:start position:0%
surrounding hydraulic conductivity of
 
00:32:22.269 --> 00:32:22.279 align:start position:0%
both insitu soils and imp placed
 
00:32:24.590 --> 00:32:24.600 align:start position:0%
engineered soils in locations both under
 
00:32:26.070 --> 00:32:26.080 align:start position:0%
and outside the footprint of the
 
00:32:28.269 --> 00:32:28.279 align:start position:0%
landfill so there are two categories of
 
00:32:29.669 --> 00:32:29.679 align:start position:0%
soil that are important to landfill
 
00:32:31.909 --> 00:32:31.919 align:start position:0%
sighting and construction the first is
 
00:32:34.070 --> 00:32:34.080 align:start position:0%
the insitu natural soils that exist at
 
00:32:36.269 --> 00:32:36.279 align:start position:0%
the site and the second is what may be
 
00:32:37.990 --> 00:32:38.000 align:start position:0%
referred to as engineered soils that may
 
00:32:39.830 --> 00:32:39.840 align:start position:0%
be mined from the site or brought in
 
00:32:42.830 --> 00:32:42.840 align:start position:0%
from offsite the first type insitu soils
 
00:32:44.789 --> 00:32:44.799 align:start position:0%
are specified in our landfill sighting
 
00:32:47.149 --> 00:32:47.159 align:start position:0%
requirements the draft uh that you have
 
00:32:48.909 --> 00:32:48.919 align:start position:0%
before you which represents the February
 
00:32:54.590 --> 00:32:54.600 align:start position:0%
15th uh um version um uh specifies that
 
00:32:56.310 --> 00:32:56.320 align:start position:0%
insitu soils beneath the footprint of
 
00:32:58.710 --> 00:32:58.720 align:start position:0%
the landfill have an average average
 
00:33:00.190 --> 00:33:00.200 align:start position:0%
hydraulic saturated hydraulic
 
00:33:04.990 --> 00:33:05.000 align:start position:0%
conductivity of 5 x 10us 3 cm/s or less
 
00:33:06.789 --> 00:33:06.799 align:start position:0%
which would be typical of a fine sand or
 
00:33:09.509 --> 00:33:09.519 align:start position:0%
a silty sand the idea behind this rule
 
00:33:10.950 --> 00:33:10.960 align:start position:0%
is to ensure that landfills are not
 
00:33:12.750 --> 00:33:12.760 align:start position:0%
sighted in locations with soils with
 
00:33:16.029 --> 00:33:16.039 align:start position:0%
high values of Hy hydraulic conductivity
 
00:33:18.509 --> 00:33:18.519 align:start position:0%
as as some coar Sands or gravels might
 
00:33:20.590 --> 00:33:20.600 align:start position:0%
exhibit um the second type the
 
00:33:22.710 --> 00:33:22.720 align:start position:0%
engineered soils are soils that are
 
00:33:24.029 --> 00:33:24.039 align:start position:0%
selected and in place during the
 
00:33:26.310 --> 00:33:26.320 align:start position:0%
construction process these soils are
 
00:33:28.149 --> 00:33:28.159 align:start position:0%
important because their specifications
 
00:33:29.710 --> 00:33:29.720 align:start position:0%
and the manner of their installation can
 
00:33:32.430 --> 00:33:32.440 align:start position:0%
be carefully controlled they are of
 
00:33:34.230 --> 00:33:34.240 align:start position:0%
require they're required to be of lower
 
00:33:35.789 --> 00:33:35.799 align:start position:0%
hydraulic conductivity than the
 
00:33:37.710 --> 00:33:37.720 align:start position:0%
specifications applicable to the insitu
 
00:33:39.950 --> 00:33:39.960 align:start position:0%
soils and because they're installed
 
00:33:42.190 --> 00:33:42.200 align:start position:0%
their consistency and homogeneity can be
 
00:33:44.950 --> 00:33:44.960 align:start position:0%
in assured they immediately underly the
 
00:33:47.070 --> 00:33:47.080 align:start position:0%
liner system and they form the first
 
00:33:48.870 --> 00:33:48.880 align:start position:0%
liner defense in the event of a liner
 
00:33:51.310 --> 00:33:51.320 align:start position:0%
system failure the rules before you
 
00:33:53.190 --> 00:33:53.200 align:start position:0%
specify that this bedding layer shall
 
00:33:55.470 --> 00:33:55.480 align:start position:0%
consist of soils with a saturated
 
00:33:58.909 --> 00:33:58.919 align:start position:0%
hydraulic conductivity of 1 time 10-4
 
00:34:01.389 --> 00:34:01.399 align:start position:0%
cm/ second or less which would be
 
00:34:03.909 --> 00:34:03.919 align:start position:0%
typical of a silty sand a silt or a
 
00:34:05.190 --> 00:34:05.200 align:start position:0%
coarse glacial
 
00:34:08.149 --> 00:34:08.159 align:start position:0%
till um also require that they have no
 
00:34:10.349 --> 00:34:10.359 align:start position:0%
Stones greater than an inch in diameter
 
00:34:12.230 --> 00:34:12.240 align:start position:0%
and be compacted in accordance with
 
00:34:14.349 --> 00:34:14.359 align:start position:0%
established engineering and ASM
 
00:34:16.909 --> 00:34:16.919 align:start position:0%
standards this is all to ensure that a
 
00:34:18.750 --> 00:34:18.760 align:start position:0%
stable and low permeability bedding
 
00:34:21.869 --> 00:34:21.879 align:start position:0%
layer is constructed um for for support
 
00:34:24.149 --> 00:34:24.159 align:start position:0%
of the engineer double liner system and
 
00:34:26.430 --> 00:34:26.440 align:start position:0%
I would note that liner system um the
 
00:34:28.510 --> 00:34:28.520 align:start position:0%
specific are consistent with liner
 
00:34:30.909 --> 00:34:30.919 align:start position:0%
systems under the federal rules for
 
00:34:32.950 --> 00:34:32.960 align:start position:0%
haard Waste landfills so they're very
 
00:34:35.550 --> 00:34:35.560 align:start position:0%
high speec um protective liner system
 
00:34:37.990 --> 00:34:38.000 align:start position:0%
that we require and that is indeed built
 
00:34:39.510 --> 00:34:39.520 align:start position:0%
uh designed and constructed here in New
 
00:34:40.750 --> 00:34:40.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire at our
 
00:34:43.750 --> 00:34:43.760 align:start position:0%
landfills so I I can break here if if
 
00:34:46.430 --> 00:34:46.440 align:start position:0%
you'd like to further ask about
 
00:34:48.750 --> 00:34:48.760 align:start position:0%
that uh thank you I think in our
 
00:34:51.069 --> 00:34:51.079 align:start position:0%
previous discussions we had talked about
 
00:34:53.470 --> 00:34:53.480 align:start position:0%
engineered double liners and then we
 
00:34:54.909 --> 00:34:54.919 align:start position:0%
also talked about the potential of a
 
00:34:58.109 --> 00:34:58.119 align:start position:0%
third clay liner right right is that
 
00:35:01.430 --> 00:35:01.440 align:start position:0%
something that we are still
 
00:35:03.589 --> 00:35:03.599 align:start position:0%
considering that that's not something
 
00:35:07.990 --> 00:35:08.000 align:start position:0%
that has been um put into the rules um
 
00:35:11.069 --> 00:35:11.079 align:start position:0%
we are concerned that um there there are
 
00:35:13.109 --> 00:35:13.119 align:start position:0%
some constructibility issues associated
 
00:35:14.750 --> 00:35:14.760 align:start position:0%
with Clay there's availability of
 
00:35:17.750 --> 00:35:17.760 align:start position:0%
materials that can be an issue um and
 
00:35:19.870 --> 00:35:19.880 align:start position:0%
then um for the reasons that I described
 
00:35:22.310 --> 00:35:22.320 align:start position:0%
earlier sometimes you actually end up it
 
00:35:24.069 --> 00:35:24.079 align:start position:0%
it's possible you could very carefully
 
00:35:26.349 --> 00:35:26.359 align:start position:0%
in place a clay layer as a triple
 
00:35:26.359 --> 00:35:27.589 align:start position:0%
in place a clay layer as a triple
protection

00:35:27.589 --> 00:35:27.599 align:start position:0%
protection
 
00:35:29.150 --> 00:35:29.160 align:start position:0%
um put it in there construct the
 
00:35:31.550 --> 00:35:31.560 align:start position:0%
landfill and then because keep in mind
 
00:35:33.910 --> 00:35:33.920 align:start position:0%
this the rules also require that the 6
 
00:35:37.630 --> 00:35:37.640 align:start position:0%
ft below the bottom liner be unsaturated
 
00:35:39.069 --> 00:35:39.079 align:start position:0%
has to be have to be above the water
 
00:35:41.870 --> 00:35:41.880 align:start position:0%
table so that clay layer Clays are most
 
00:35:43.950 --> 00:35:43.960 align:start position:0%
effective and in in terms of low
 
00:35:45.589 --> 00:35:45.599 align:start position:0%
hydraulic conductivity when they're
 
00:35:48.510 --> 00:35:48.520 align:start position:0%
moistened and so but by sighting that
 
00:35:50.390 --> 00:35:50.400 align:start position:0%
kind of a layer in an area that is
 
00:35:52.710 --> 00:35:52.720 align:start position:0%
designed to be above the water table
 
00:35:55.230 --> 00:35:55.240 align:start position:0%
even if you do a great job installing it
 
00:35:56.829 --> 00:35:56.839 align:start position:0%
what the industry has found and what
 
00:35:58.470 --> 00:35:58.480 align:start position:0%
what other states have found is that in
 
00:36:00.390 --> 00:36:00.400 align:start position:0%
some cases these desiccation cracks
 
00:36:02.870 --> 00:36:02.880 align:start position:0%
develop and you end up with actually
 
00:36:04.589 --> 00:36:04.599 align:start position:0%
something that would be much worse and
 
00:36:07.270 --> 00:36:07.280 align:start position:0%
much less protective than just a tight
 
00:36:09.349 --> 00:36:09.359 align:start position:0%
even just a 10 the minus three soil um
 
00:36:11.230 --> 00:36:11.240 align:start position:0%
it would actually be convey
 
00:36:12.910 --> 00:36:12.920 align:start position:0%
contamination in the event of a liner
 
00:36:16.670 --> 00:36:16.680 align:start position:0%
leak more quickly than a silty sand say
 
00:36:19.470 --> 00:36:19.480 align:start position:0%
or or a or a fine
 
00:36:21.870 --> 00:36:21.880 align:start position:0%
sand and while we're talking about water
 
00:36:23.430 --> 00:36:23.440 align:start position:0%
tables and given um sort of
 
00:36:25.630 --> 00:36:25.640 align:start position:0%
environmental changes that we are seeing
 
00:36:27.430 --> 00:36:27.440 align:start position:0%
with you know
 
00:36:30.950 --> 00:36:30.960 align:start position:0%
um water levels rising in some places um
 
00:36:33.589 --> 00:36:33.599 align:start position:0%
I'm assuming that those are also factors
 
00:36:36.670 --> 00:36:36.680 align:start position:0%
that you all are taking into account
 
00:36:38.270 --> 00:36:38.280 align:start position:0%
when you're having these conversations
 
00:36:39.470 --> 00:36:39.480 align:start position:0%
around the
 
00:36:42.349 --> 00:36:42.359 align:start position:0%
rules yes and when you when you site
 
00:36:44.349 --> 00:36:44.359 align:start position:0%
either a new landfill or an expansion of
 
00:36:47.790 --> 00:36:47.800 align:start position:0%
an existing landfill one of the key
 
00:36:50.069 --> 00:36:50.079 align:start position:0%
challenges is to ensure that you have
 
00:36:52.829 --> 00:36:52.839 align:start position:0%
that six Fe of Separation um to be
 
00:36:55.190 --> 00:36:55.200 align:start position:0%
candid obviously landfills are not in a
 
00:36:56.670 --> 00:36:56.680 align:start position:0%
charitable business they want to Max
 
00:36:59.309 --> 00:36:59.319 align:start position:0%
maximize their their uh their capacity
 
00:37:02.390 --> 00:37:02.400 align:start position:0%
to uh to accept waste and so they're not
 
00:37:03.670 --> 00:37:03.680 align:start position:0%
looking they're looking to meet the
 
00:37:05.829 --> 00:37:05.839 align:start position:0%
standard but they're not looking to sort
 
00:37:07.390 --> 00:37:07.400 align:start position:0%
of gratuitously put another couple of
 
00:37:09.670 --> 00:37:09.680 align:start position:0%
feet of unsaturated soil in there to be
 
00:37:11.390 --> 00:37:11.400 align:start position:0%
safe they're going to meet the standard
 
00:37:12.430 --> 00:37:12.440 align:start position:0%
that's what they're going to meet so
 
00:37:14.589 --> 00:37:14.599 align:start position:0%
they have to work very hard to make sure
 
00:37:16.150 --> 00:37:16.160 align:start position:0%
that they demonstrate to the agency that
 
00:37:18.030 --> 00:37:18.040 align:start position:0%
they're going to meet that that six feet
 
00:37:19.910 --> 00:37:19.920 align:start position:0%
of Separation distance and and we hold
 
00:37:23.990 --> 00:37:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:27.630 --> 00:37:27.640 align:start position:0%
that so going back to the um the
 
00:37:29.950 --> 00:37:29.960 align:start position:0%
statement in regards with sand and stuff
 
00:37:34.190 --> 00:37:34.200 align:start position:0%
so um so fine sand maybe close to five
 
00:37:37.950 --> 00:37:37.960 align:start position:0%
times negative to the neg3 but Dees has
 
00:37:42.309 --> 00:37:42.319 align:start position:0%
now allowed it um to be average which
 
00:37:45.670 --> 00:37:45.680 align:start position:0%
means the substantial Parts um of the
 
00:37:47.550 --> 00:37:47.560 align:start position:0%
site can be pure
 
00:37:49.950 --> 00:37:49.960 align:start position:0%
gravel no that's I don't think that's a
 
00:37:51.990 --> 00:37:52.000 align:start position:0%
a fair statement um what what that
 
00:37:54.309 --> 00:37:54.319 align:start position:0%
recognizes is that it goes back to that
 
00:37:57.109 --> 00:37:57.119 align:start position:0%
issue of homogeneity um and the the idea
 
00:37:59.030 --> 00:37:59.040 align:start position:0%
that um I mean it's been suggested some
 
00:38:01.069 --> 00:38:01.079 align:start position:0%
people suggested take a bunch of
 
00:38:03.750 --> 00:38:03.760 align:start position:0%
readings and the most conductive area of
 
00:38:05.589 --> 00:38:05.599 align:start position:0%
the site is then declared to be
 
00:38:07.430 --> 00:38:07.440 align:start position:0%
representative of the site and that's
 
00:38:10.430 --> 00:38:10.440 align:start position:0%
not true either so what I think um we
 
00:38:12.910 --> 00:38:12.920 align:start position:0%
were hearing is that if there isn't some
 
00:38:15.470 --> 00:38:15.480 align:start position:0%
opportunity to look at a representative
 
00:38:18.150 --> 00:38:18.160 align:start position:0%
average of the formation which we can
 
00:38:21.230 --> 00:38:21.240 align:start position:0%
use our hydrogeologists to to ensure
 
00:38:23.309 --> 00:38:23.319 align:start position:0%
that that is done in a workmanlike and
 
00:38:26.790 --> 00:38:26.800 align:start position:0%
in in a defensible way um then you could
 
00:38:31.190 --> 00:38:31.200 align:start position:0%
have a situation where one sample of a
 
00:38:33.470 --> 00:38:33.480 align:start position:0%
lens of more conductive material would
 
00:38:36.750 --> 00:38:36.760 align:start position:0%
eliminate an entire site candidly in a
 
00:38:38.589 --> 00:38:38.599 align:start position:0%
way that's unfair and then not really
 
00:38:40.470 --> 00:38:40.480 align:start position:0%
not doesn't really make sense and so
 
00:38:42.190 --> 00:38:42.200 align:start position:0%
that's what we were hearing again I I
 
00:38:44.190 --> 00:38:44.200 align:start position:0%
want to emphasize when we heard these
 
00:38:46.510 --> 00:38:46.520 align:start position:0%
comments and concerns from the industry
 
00:38:48.190 --> 00:38:48.200 align:start position:0%
we really dug in and we listened to what
 
00:38:49.470 --> 00:38:49.480 align:start position:0%
they were saying and we went back and
 
00:38:51.510 --> 00:38:51.520 align:start position:0%
looked at it we've not made all the
 
00:38:54.390 --> 00:38:54.400 align:start position:0%
changes they requested by any measure um
 
00:38:56.069 --> 00:38:56.079 align:start position:0%
and but but we did realize that we made
 
00:38:58.510 --> 00:38:58.520 align:start position:0%
some errors when we when we first
 
00:38:59.990 --> 00:39:00.000 align:start position:0%
proposed the rules and there were some
 
00:39:02.710 --> 00:39:02.720 align:start position:0%
areas where we were going to have
 
00:39:04.589 --> 00:39:04.599 align:start position:0%
probably unintended consequences that
 
00:39:06.150 --> 00:39:06.160 align:start position:0%
nobody wanted that the agency didn't
 
00:39:07.670 --> 00:39:07.680 align:start position:0%
want it that the public doesn't want and
 
00:39:09.510 --> 00:39:09.520 align:start position:0%
certainly that the industry didn't want
 
00:39:10.670 --> 00:39:10.680 align:start position:0%
and those are the areas where we've
 
00:39:12.870 --> 00:39:12.880 align:start position:0%
elected to make changes in order to
 
00:39:16.190 --> 00:39:16.200 align:start position:0%
address those errors and that's you know
 
00:39:18.030 --> 00:39:18.040 align:start position:0%
I think that's the most plain way that I
 
00:39:22.030 --> 00:39:22.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:30.390 --> 00:39:30.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:33.390 --> 00:39:33.400 align:start position:0%
I I can deliver the rest of my remarks
 
00:39:36.190 --> 00:39:36.200 align:start position:0%
in probably five minutes or less that's
 
00:39:37.069 --> 00:39:37.079 align:start position:0%
if that's
 
00:39:37.079 --> 00:39:39.670 align:start position:0%
if that's
helpful

00:39:39.670 --> 00:39:39.680 align:start position:0%
helpful
 
00:39:43.150 --> 00:39:43.160 align:start position:0%
okay sure so um the next area that we
 
00:39:44.790 --> 00:39:44.800 align:start position:0%
was was some questions that centered
 
00:39:46.309 --> 00:39:46.319 align:start position:0%
around what I think really amounts to do
 
00:39:48.550 --> 00:39:48.560 align:start position:0%
the rules consider climate change and
 
00:39:50.150 --> 00:39:50.160 align:start position:0%
the and and the clear answer to that is
 
00:39:51.990 --> 00:39:52.000 align:start position:0%
yes and as I stated in my introductory
 
00:39:54.349 --> 00:39:54.359 align:start position:0%
remarks these proposed rules reflect the
 
00:39:55.910 --> 00:39:55.920 align:start position:0%
collective experiences and learning of
 
00:39:57.190 --> 00:39:57.200 align:start position:0%
our staff
 
00:39:59.230 --> 00:39:59.240 align:start position:0%
um and the and and particularly relative
 
00:40:00.870 --> 00:40:00.880 align:start position:0%
to the kinds of problems that we see at
 
00:40:03.030 --> 00:40:03.040 align:start position:0%
landfills and among these problems are
 
00:40:04.750 --> 00:40:04.760 align:start position:0%
the impacts of increased frequency
 
00:40:07.030 --> 00:40:07.040 align:start position:0%
intensity of rainfall events and
 
00:40:08.309 --> 00:40:08.319 align:start position:0%
temperature changes that lead to
 
00:40:11.190 --> 00:40:11.200 align:start position:0%
increased freeze th thaw cycling these
 
00:40:12.829 --> 00:40:12.839 align:start position:0%
are not prospective events we've been
 
00:40:14.950 --> 00:40:14.960 align:start position:0%
witnessing them for several years now
 
00:40:16.829 --> 00:40:16.839 align:start position:0%
these proposed rules include changes to
 
00:40:18.829 --> 00:40:18.839 align:start position:0%
sighting criteria and storm water and
 
00:40:21.349 --> 00:40:21.359 align:start position:0%
leech a management rules that reflect an
 
00:40:23.390 --> 00:40:23.400 align:start position:0%
attempt to address actual operational
 
00:40:24.870 --> 00:40:24.880 align:start position:0%
problems that we're W witnessing at
 
00:40:27.030 --> 00:40:27.040 align:start position:0%
landfills the changes are intended to
 
00:40:28.790 --> 00:40:28.800 align:start position:0%
account for and effectively manage these
 
00:40:30.990 --> 00:40:31.000 align:start position:0%
intensified events to ensure that
 
00:40:33.069 --> 00:40:33.079 align:start position:0%
landfills can continue to be operated
 
00:40:35.349 --> 00:40:35.359 align:start position:0%
safely and protectively as our climate
 
00:40:38.069 --> 00:40:38.079 align:start position:0%
continues to change examples of changes
 
00:40:40.270 --> 00:40:40.280 align:start position:0%
include uh requiring lee8 collection and
 
00:40:42.710 --> 00:40:42.720 align:start position:0%
removal systems to be designed for the
 
00:40:45.990 --> 00:40:46.000 align:start position:0%
25-year storm plus an additional 20%
 
00:40:47.150 --> 00:40:47.160 align:start position:0%
this accounts for additional
 
00:40:48.910 --> 00:40:48.920 align:start position:0%
precipitation associated with more
 
00:40:51.550 --> 00:40:51.560 align:start position:0%
intense storm events and also for snow
 
00:40:54.510 --> 00:40:54.520 align:start position:0%
melt um infiltration also the storm
 
00:40:56.270 --> 00:40:56.280 align:start position:0%
Water Management Systems including storm
 
00:40:58.349 --> 00:40:58.359 align:start position:0%
stor water detention ponds will be
 
00:41:00.430 --> 00:41:00.440 align:start position:0%
required to be designed and constructed
 
00:41:03.510 --> 00:41:03.520 align:start position:0%
to handle 50e storms uh where previously
 
00:41:06.390 --> 00:41:06.400 align:start position:0%
the standard was 25e
 
00:41:10.190 --> 00:41:10.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:13.270 --> 00:41:13.280 align:start position:0%
this uh no was two different categories
 
00:41:17.190 --> 00:41:17.200 align:start position:0%
so so the first one was um
 
00:41:17.200 --> 00:41:19.150 align:start position:0%
so so the first one was um
regarding

00:41:19.150 --> 00:41:19.160 align:start position:0%
regarding
 
00:41:22.870 --> 00:41:22.880 align:start position:0%
um uh leate collection and removal
 
00:41:25.030 --> 00:41:25.040 align:start position:0%
systems for those they have to be
 
00:41:27.109 --> 00:41:27.119 align:start position:0%
designed to the 25 years storm that's Al
 
00:41:30.030 --> 00:41:30.040 align:start position:0%
always been true but then we've added a
 
00:41:31.950 --> 00:41:31.960 align:start position:0%
requirement that you you calculate what
 
00:41:34.950 --> 00:41:34.960 align:start position:0%
the 25e storm is and then add 20% and
 
00:41:37.349 --> 00:41:37.359 align:start position:0%
you designed to that
 
00:41:40.190 --> 00:41:40.200 align:start position:0%
standard Murray thank you uh Mr chair
 
00:41:41.950 --> 00:41:41.960 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question um
 
00:41:44.829 --> 00:41:44.839 align:start position:0%
with regard to the 50-year storm
 
00:41:47.030 --> 00:41:47.040 align:start position:0%
preparation there are other places in
 
00:41:48.309 --> 00:41:48.319 align:start position:0%
which we see a 100-year storm
 
00:41:50.950 --> 00:41:50.960 align:start position:0%
preparation so um throughout the state
 
00:41:53.190 --> 00:41:53.200 align:start position:0%
planning of various other infrastructure
 
00:41:55.069 --> 00:41:55.079 align:start position:0%
sure can you explain the reason for
 
00:41:58.190 --> 00:41:58.200 align:start position:0%
choosing a 50 years storm yeah and then
 
00:41:59.910 --> 00:41:59.920 align:start position:0%
part parts of that there are parts of
 
00:42:01.870 --> 00:42:01.880 align:start position:0%
our rules that also require design for
 
00:42:03.510 --> 00:42:03.520 align:start position:0%
100-year storm and it's for different
 
00:42:05.910 --> 00:42:05.920 align:start position:0%
components of the system and a lot of it
 
00:42:08.349 --> 00:42:08.359 align:start position:0%
centers on you know what is the role of
 
00:42:10.589 --> 00:42:10.599 align:start position:0%
that particular system and what happens
 
00:42:12.390 --> 00:42:12.400 align:start position:0%
if it's over toau what's the consequence
 
00:42:14.270 --> 00:42:14.280 align:start position:0%
if it if it's if its capacity is
 
00:42:16.349 --> 00:42:16.359 align:start position:0%
exceeded one of the issues you know
 
00:42:17.309 --> 00:42:17.319 align:start position:0%
everybody can say well why don't you
 
00:42:19.069 --> 00:42:19.079 align:start position:0%
just design everything for the 500e
 
00:42:20.790 --> 00:42:20.800 align:start position:0%
storm and and the problem with that is
 
00:42:23.069 --> 00:42:23.079 align:start position:0%
is that then you you end up with
 
00:42:25.589 --> 00:42:25.599 align:start position:0%
physical um manifestations that you
 
00:42:27.109 --> 00:42:27.119 align:start position:0%
would not have imagine I mean if if
 
00:42:29.270 --> 00:42:29.280 align:start position:0%
somebody designed a a highway or a
 
00:42:31.589 --> 00:42:31.599 align:start position:0%
culvert for a 500-year storm you'd have
 
00:42:33.470 --> 00:42:33.480 align:start position:0%
to drive up over it you order you know
 
00:42:35.870 --> 00:42:35.880 align:start position:0%
it would be so huge so so a lot of them
 
00:42:38.430 --> 00:42:38.440 align:start position:0%
are practical design considerations and
 
00:42:40.109 --> 00:42:40.119 align:start position:0%
and everything is offsetting right so
 
00:42:41.950 --> 00:42:41.960 align:start position:0%
you you design a particular system for a
 
00:42:44.870 --> 00:42:44.880 align:start position:0%
certain flow needs to be a certain size
 
00:42:46.510 --> 00:42:46.520 align:start position:0%
and how it's constructed and the space
 
00:42:49.190 --> 00:42:49.200 align:start position:0%
it takes up has impacts on other systems
 
00:42:51.190 --> 00:42:51.200 align:start position:0%
so the rules really reflect a balancing
 
00:42:54.470 --> 00:42:54.480 align:start position:0%
of those considerations balancing risk
 
00:42:55.910 --> 00:42:55.920 align:start position:0%
and and really trying to I know for
 
00:42:57.829 --> 00:42:57.839 align:start position:0%
examp example you know we we proposed
 
00:43:00.190 --> 00:43:00.200 align:start position:0%
that sighting of landfills which used to
 
00:43:03.390 --> 00:43:03.400 align:start position:0%
be 100e storm 100e flood plane is now
 
00:43:06.349 --> 00:43:06.359 align:start position:0%
500e flood plane sorry um sorry it it
 
00:43:07.990 --> 00:43:08.000 align:start position:0%
used to be 100e flood plane now it's
 
00:43:10.390 --> 00:43:10.400 align:start position:0%
500e flood plane so as you can imagine
 
00:43:11.430 --> 00:43:11.440 align:start position:0%
that's a you know the landfill is going
 
00:43:12.870 --> 00:43:12.880 align:start position:0%
to be there forever you want to make
 
00:43:14.430 --> 00:43:14.440 align:start position:0%
sure that you're really looking at a
 
00:43:16.670 --> 00:43:16.680 align:start position:0%
sighting that is not going to run into a
 
00:43:18.750 --> 00:43:18.760 align:start position:0%
problem even the event of a very uh you
 
00:43:21.750 --> 00:43:21.760 align:start position:0%
know rare storm so I hope that addresses
 
00:43:24.950 --> 00:43:24.960 align:start position:0%
your question thank you so then the next
 
00:43:27.549 --> 00:43:27.559 align:start position:0%
area is uh time travel considerations
 
00:43:29.190 --> 00:43:29.200 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee expressed a belief that
 
00:43:30.990 --> 00:43:31.000 align:start position:0%
language relating to ensuring that leaks
 
00:43:32.990 --> 00:43:33.000 align:start position:0%
or failures could be detected and
 
00:43:34.790 --> 00:43:34.800 align:start position:0%
remediated prior to contamination
 
00:43:36.549 --> 00:43:36.559 align:start position:0%
reaching nearby surface water had been
 
00:43:39.069 --> 00:43:39.079 align:start position:0%
deleted and also expressed a desire for
 
00:43:41.150 --> 00:43:41.160 align:start position:0%
a specific time of travel to be
 
00:43:43.349 --> 00:43:43.359 align:start position:0%
identified in the rule so on the first
 
00:43:45.230 --> 00:43:45.240 align:start position:0%
issue uh the subcommittee questioned why
 
00:43:49.069 --> 00:43:49.079 align:start position:0%
the provisions of specifically enw
 
00:43:52.349 --> 00:43:52.359 align:start position:0%
843c had been deleted and in fact this
 
00:43:54.549 --> 00:43:54.559 align:start position:0%
section was not deleted but rather was
 
00:43:56.069 --> 00:43:56.079 align:start position:0%
strengthened by adding additional Lang
 
00:43:58.349 --> 00:43:58.359 align:start position:0%
language within that section and then
 
00:44:00.190 --> 00:44:00.200 align:start position:0%
reorganizing and removing the struck
 
00:44:03.349 --> 00:44:03.359 align:start position:0%
language to section 80403 H so that's a
 
00:44:04.829 --> 00:44:04.839 align:start position:0%
little in the weeds but but that
 
00:44:06.150 --> 00:44:06.160 align:start position:0%
language none of that language has been
 
00:44:07.950 --> 00:44:07.960 align:start position:0%
deleted it's just been reorganized and
 
00:44:10.190 --> 00:44:10.200 align:start position:0%
and moved um and I would argue
 
00:44:11.670 --> 00:44:11.680 align:start position:0%
strengthened as well with the additional
 
00:44:14.270 --> 00:44:14.280 align:start position:0%
language and then as to establishing a
 
00:44:16.069 --> 00:44:16.079 align:start position:0%
specific numerical time of travel
 
00:44:18.270 --> 00:44:18.280 align:start position:0%
standard as we've discussed previously
 
00:44:20.030 --> 00:44:20.040 align:start position:0%
with a subcommittee we believe that
 
00:44:22.829 --> 00:44:22.839 align:start position:0%
proposed numerical setbacks setback
 
00:44:25.430 --> 00:44:25.440 align:start position:0%
distances in feet are protective and
 
00:44:27.270 --> 00:44:27.280 align:start position:0%
provide a simpler standard that's easier
 
00:44:29.589 --> 00:44:29.599 align:start position:0%
to administer and enforce and much less
 
00:44:30.990 --> 00:44:31.000 align:start position:0%
susceptible to
 
00:44:33.750 --> 00:44:33.760 align:start position:0%
appeal um and then the next category is
 
00:44:36.150 --> 00:44:36.160 align:start position:0%
the ownership of landfill infrastructure
 
00:44:37.750 --> 00:44:37.760 align:start position:0%
and that was with regard to footprint
 
00:44:40.470 --> 00:44:40.480 align:start position:0%
land leech a handling and Roads the
 
00:44:42.150 --> 00:44:42.160 align:start position:0%
subcommittee asked several questions
 
00:44:43.950 --> 00:44:43.960 align:start position:0%
regard related to the requirement that
 
00:44:46.069 --> 00:44:46.079 align:start position:0%
landfill property be owned by the permit
 
00:44:49.270 --> 00:44:49.280 align:start position:0%
e and the subcommittee also asked DS to
 
00:44:52.309 --> 00:44:52.319 align:start position:0%
clarify that the landfill um includes
 
00:44:54.510 --> 00:44:54.520 align:start position:0%
infrastructure like tanks and lagoons
 
00:44:56.430 --> 00:44:56.440 align:start position:0%
which I presume it refers to storm water
 
00:44:58.790 --> 00:44:58.800 align:start position:0%
detention ponds um the answer is yes
 
00:45:00.230 --> 00:45:00.240 align:start position:0%
these are considered to be included in
 
00:45:02.190 --> 00:45:02.200 align:start position:0%
the definition of facility and that
 
00:45:03.950 --> 00:45:03.960 align:start position:0%
that's actually a statutory definition
 
00:45:06.950 --> 00:45:06.960 align:start position:0%
that stems right from the statute um the
 
00:45:08.910 --> 00:45:08.920 align:start position:0%
committee also asked if this applies to
 
00:45:10.870 --> 00:45:10.880 align:start position:0%
private roads that provide access to the
 
00:45:13.190 --> 00:45:13.200 align:start position:0%
site this is a topic that's been called
 
00:45:14.910 --> 00:45:14.920 align:start position:0%
into question relative to a permit
 
00:45:17.069 --> 00:45:17.079 align:start position:0%
application that is currently pending
 
00:45:19.390 --> 00:45:19.400 align:start position:0%
before the department so it would not be
 
00:45:20.630 --> 00:45:20.640 align:start position:0%
appropriate for the Department to
 
00:45:23.589 --> 00:45:23.599 align:start position:0%
comment on that topic at this time and
 
00:45:25.270 --> 00:45:25.280 align:start position:0%
then lastly the last group that we
 
00:45:27.190 --> 00:45:27.200 align:start position:0%
categorize the questions into was
 
00:45:29.309 --> 00:45:29.319 align:start position:0%
requests to consider additions of
 
00:45:31.349 --> 00:45:31.359 align:start position:0%
certain Concepts to the rules the
 
00:45:32.630 --> 00:45:32.640 align:start position:0%
subcommittee asked about the
 
00:45:34.230 --> 00:45:34.240 align:start position:0%
Department's interest in considering
 
00:45:37.710 --> 00:45:37.720 align:start position:0%
several additional Concepts or rule
 
00:45:37.720 --> 00:45:39.549 align:start position:0%
several additional Concepts or rule
Provisions

00:45:39.549 --> 00:45:39.559 align:start position:0%
Provisions
 
00:45:42.549 --> 00:45:42.559 align:start position:0%
um and uh first of all the subcommittee
 
00:45:45.109 --> 00:45:45.119 align:start position:0%
asked if a rule could be added requiring
 
00:45:46.750 --> 00:45:46.760 align:start position:0%
an applicant to hire an independent
 
00:45:48.750 --> 00:45:48.760 align:start position:0%
hydrogeologist to estimate seepage
 
00:45:50.990 --> 00:45:51.000 align:start position:0%
velocity at the site and calculate a
 
00:45:53.549 --> 00:45:53.559 align:start position:0%
5-year distance of travel this was the
 
00:45:55.349 --> 00:45:55.359 align:start position:0%
subject of the of some previous failed
 
00:45:55.359 --> 00:45:56.510 align:start position:0%
subject of the of some previous failed
legislation

00:45:56.510 --> 00:45:56.520 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:45:58.030 --> 00:45:58.040 align:start position:0%
thees doesn't believe it could impose
 
00:46:00.990 --> 00:46:01.000 align:start position:0%
such a rule without a change in the law
 
00:46:02.510 --> 00:46:02.520 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee also asked several
 
00:46:04.069 --> 00:46:04.079 align:start position:0%
other questions regarding imposing
 
00:46:06.589 --> 00:46:06.599 align:start position:0%
alternate soil requirements required
 
00:46:08.910 --> 00:46:08.920 align:start position:0%
hydraulic conductivity standards and
 
00:46:11.630 --> 00:46:11.640 align:start position:0%
specific setback distances we believe
 
00:46:13.270 --> 00:46:13.280 align:start position:0%
that our proposed sighting Criterion
 
00:46:15.829 --> 00:46:15.839 align:start position:0%
setbacks uh will be appropriate and
 
00:46:18.589 --> 00:46:18.599 align:start position:0%
protective and um sub committee also
 
00:46:20.150 --> 00:46:20.160 align:start position:0%
asked if sighting criteria could be
 
00:46:22.670 --> 00:46:22.680 align:start position:0%
amended to include requirements that any
 
00:46:24.829 --> 00:46:24.839 align:start position:0%
new landfills be cited not closer than
 
00:46:27.829 --> 00:46:27.839 align:start position:0%
30 miles from a super fund site or from
 
00:46:30.630 --> 00:46:30.640 align:start position:0%
another landfill and we don't see any
 
00:46:33.349 --> 00:46:33.359 align:start position:0%
basis uh for such requirements we knowe
 
00:46:35.870 --> 00:46:35.880 align:start position:0%
that there are over 300 closed landfills
 
00:46:37.390 --> 00:46:37.400 align:start position:0%
in the state and if that were
 
00:46:39.390 --> 00:46:39.400 align:start position:0%
implemented as proposed it probably
 
00:46:41.829 --> 00:46:41.839 align:start position:0%
would eliminate the entire state from
 
00:46:44.670 --> 00:46:44.680 align:start position:0%
consideration for landfill sighting um
 
00:46:46.150 --> 00:46:46.160 align:start position:0%
and that that concludes our review of
 
00:46:48.309 --> 00:46:48.319 align:start position:0%
the topics and we're happy to further
 
00:46:50.589 --> 00:46:50.599 align:start position:0%
questions thank you any um and can you
 
00:46:52.950 --> 00:46:52.960 align:start position:0%
provide that your written testimony is
 
00:46:54.630 --> 00:46:54.640 align:start position:0%
that possible sure I can I can I can
 
00:46:56.549 --> 00:46:56.559 align:start position:0%
email the the committee of copy when I
 
00:46:58.430 --> 00:46:58.440 align:start position:0%
get back to the office than and
 
00:47:01.190 --> 00:47:01.200 align:start position:0%
represent Murray than you I do have a
 
00:47:06.069 --> 00:47:06.079 align:start position:0%
couple of questions to the uh redlined
 
00:47:08.069 --> 00:47:08.079 align:start position:0%
striketh through changes um one of them
 
00:47:10.870 --> 00:47:10.880 align:start position:0%
I did have was with regard to the I
 
00:47:11.950 --> 00:47:11.960 align:start position:0%
guess the
 
00:47:16.069 --> 00:47:16.079 align:start position:0%
re the addition on page four about um
 
00:47:19.470 --> 00:47:19.480 align:start position:0%
level one and two perennial streams in
 
00:47:21.349 --> 00:47:21.359 align:start position:0%
the you say page four you mean the
 
00:47:23.829 --> 00:47:23.839 align:start position:0%
commit of the draft of your of the draft
 
00:47:26.549 --> 00:47:26.559 align:start position:0%
okay Council draft let me uh
 
00:47:29.510 --> 00:47:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:31.630 --> 00:47:31.640 align:start position:0%
that I'm sorry could you repeat the
 
00:47:34.390 --> 00:47:34.400 align:start position:0%
question it yes it was around um the
 
00:47:36.630 --> 00:47:36.640 align:start position:0%
conversation about level one and two
 
00:47:40.190 --> 00:47:40.200 align:start position:0%
perennial streams I believe um and it
 
00:47:42.309 --> 00:47:42.319 align:start position:0%
looks like initially it said any
 
00:47:44.710 --> 00:47:44.720 align:start position:0%
perennial stream and now there's a
 
00:47:46.430 --> 00:47:46.440 align:start position:0%
conversation about level one and two
 
00:47:49.549 --> 00:47:49.559 align:start position:0%
perennial streams so can you speak to
 
00:47:52.430 --> 00:47:52.440 align:start position:0%
the rationale around that sure yeah what
 
00:47:53.829 --> 00:47:53.839 align:start position:0%
we learned is that that that's probably
 
00:47:55.710 --> 00:47:55.720 align:start position:0%
an area where we uh with good intent
 
00:47:57.190 --> 00:47:57.200 align:start position:0%
mention we probably overshot the runway
 
00:48:00.349 --> 00:48:00.359 align:start position:0%
a little bit um if you look at you know
 
00:48:02.309 --> 00:48:02.319 align:start position:0%
the um the lay of the land in New
 
00:48:06.790 --> 00:48:06.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire there are um On Any Given site
 
00:48:09.069 --> 00:48:09.079 align:start position:0%
on larger sites that might be likely
 
00:48:11.109 --> 00:48:11.119 align:start position:0%
potential candidates for landfills they
 
00:48:13.790 --> 00:48:13.800 align:start position:0%
are likely to be very small um initial
 
00:48:16.790 --> 00:48:16.800 align:start position:0%
first and second order streams that um
 
00:48:19.109 --> 00:48:19.119 align:start position:0%
would would basically potentially be
 
00:48:27.589 --> 00:48:27.599 align:start position:0%
impacted and um uh if you impose the um
 
00:48:30.589 --> 00:48:30.599 align:start position:0%
the 500 foot the new 500 foot setback
 
00:48:32.510 --> 00:48:32.520 align:start position:0%
would probably eliminate many many sites
 
00:48:34.030 --> 00:48:34.040 align:start position:0%
and make it very difficult to sight a
 
00:48:36.470 --> 00:48:36.480 align:start position:0%
landfill and so we from a practical
 
00:48:38.309 --> 00:48:38.319 align:start position:0%
standpoint we realized that we could
 
00:48:40.150 --> 00:48:40.160 align:start position:0%
draw a distinction between those and
 
00:48:42.829 --> 00:48:42.839 align:start position:0%
other more substantial streams so we
 
00:48:45.549 --> 00:48:45.559 align:start position:0%
continue with the 500 foot for the other
 
00:48:47.150 --> 00:48:47.160 align:start position:0%
perennial streams but for the first and
 
00:48:50.270 --> 00:48:50.280 align:start position:0%
second order streams we propos to revert
 
00:48:54.589 --> 00:48:54.599 align:start position:0%
to the original existing standard of 200
 
00:48:54.599 --> 00:48:57.630 align:start position:0%
to the original existing standard of 200
feet

00:48:57.630 --> 00:48:57.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:01.190 --> 00:49:01.200 align:start position:0%
okay what I'd like to do is um s if you
 
00:49:04.150 --> 00:49:04.160 align:start position:0%
could just uh stick around and if we got
 
00:49:05.750 --> 00:49:05.760 align:start position:0%
a little more time more questions but
 
00:49:08.309 --> 00:49:08.319 align:start position:0%
I'd like to get Mr Podi up here as I did
 
00:49:13.589 --> 00:49:13.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:24.510 --> 00:49:24.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:24.520 --> 00:49:27.589 align:start position:0%
 
you

00:49:27.589 --> 00:49:27.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:29.430 --> 00:49:29.440 align:start position:0%
good morning good morning and welcome I
 
00:49:31.270 --> 00:49:31.280 align:start position:0%
just wanted to publicly thank you for
 
00:49:33.349 --> 00:49:33.359 align:start position:0%
inviting us down to take a look at the
 
00:49:35.670 --> 00:49:35.680 align:start position:0%
waste management site on the 5ifth
 
00:49:37.230 --> 00:49:37.240 align:start position:0%
looking forward to it happy to have you
 
00:49:38.829 --> 00:49:38.839 align:start position:0%
there yeah I think that'll be a
 
00:49:41.430 --> 00:49:41.440 align:start position:0%
worthwhile trip for whoever's willing to
 
00:49:44.589 --> 00:49:44.599 align:start position:0%
come um I understand DS will be there I
 
00:49:47.549 --> 00:49:47.559 align:start position:0%
think that's great as well um give folks
 
00:49:49.349 --> 00:49:49.359 align:start position:0%
an opportunity to ask questions and
 
00:49:52.270 --> 00:49:52.280 align:start position:0%
discuss the site and just generally what
 
00:49:54.030 --> 00:49:54.040 align:start position:0%
we do as a company and what some of the
 
00:49:56.309 --> 00:49:56.319 align:start position:0%
challenges we have um um you know in the
 
00:49:59.589 --> 00:49:59.599 align:start position:0%
industry so looking forward to it great
 
00:50:01.549 --> 00:50:01.559 align:start position:0%
and I I mean my
 
00:50:05.069 --> 00:50:05.079 align:start position:0%
question first of all is what is your
 
00:50:09.349 --> 00:50:09.359 align:start position:0%
opinion of the process and the progress
 
00:50:11.789 --> 00:50:11.799 align:start position:0%
of the ru making from an industry
 
00:50:15.510 --> 00:50:15.520 align:start position:0%
perspective okay um just from a history
 
00:50:18.829 --> 00:50:18.839 align:start position:0%
standpoint I've um I've been in New
 
00:50:20.589 --> 00:50:20.599 align:start position:0%
Hampshire doing what I'm doing now for
 
00:50:23.950 --> 00:50:23.960 align:start position:0%
over 30 years have worked with Dees
 
00:50:25.950 --> 00:50:25.960 align:start position:0%
throughout that period of time in a
 
00:50:28.349 --> 00:50:28.359 align:start position:0%
engineering compliance role and
 
00:50:30.470 --> 00:50:30.480 align:start position:0%
currently uh in an operations role if
 
00:50:34.470 --> 00:50:34.480 align:start position:0%
you will um my experience the the dees
 
00:50:36.910 --> 00:50:36.920 align:start position:0%
does a great job uh in the task that's
 
00:50:39.710 --> 00:50:39.720 align:start position:0%
in front of them uh historically uh the
 
00:50:42.030 --> 00:50:42.040 align:start position:0%
rules you know are updated every 10
 
00:50:44.030 --> 00:50:44.040 align:start position:0%
years or so and I've been involved uh in
 
00:50:46.829 --> 00:50:46.839 align:start position:0%
some capacity in those prior
 
00:50:51.030 --> 00:50:51.040 align:start position:0%
reviews and in the past we've had
 
00:50:54.950 --> 00:50:54.960 align:start position:0%
meetings years ago with Dees folks in
 
00:50:56.349 --> 00:50:56.359 align:start position:0%
the industry and folks that were not in
 
00:50:59.030 --> 00:50:59.040 align:start position:0%
the industry going through issues
 
00:51:01.190 --> 00:51:01.200 align:start position:0%
changes concerns and those were all
 
00:51:04.630 --> 00:51:04.640 align:start position:0%
considered currently um I think the
 
00:51:06.150 --> 00:51:06.160 align:start position:0%
process that's being done now is a
 
00:51:09.349 --> 00:51:09.359 align:start position:0%
little cumbersome but I understand uh
 
00:51:11.069 --> 00:51:11.079 align:start position:0%
there's folks that are on either side of
 
00:51:12.950 --> 00:51:12.960 align:start position:0%
the table looking at the rules that are
 
00:51:15.670 --> 00:51:15.680 align:start position:0%
currently in place and wanting changes
 
00:51:18.630 --> 00:51:18.640 align:start position:0%
to be made um we have worked through the
 
00:51:20.309 --> 00:51:20.319 align:start position:0%
change through the changes but also
 
00:51:21.950 --> 00:51:21.960 align:start position:0%
through the rules that are currently in
 
00:51:25.390 --> 00:51:25.400 align:start position:0%
place and have been able to you know de
 
00:51:27.549 --> 00:51:27.559 align:start position:0%
velop the turnkey facility and keep that
 
00:51:29.109 --> 00:51:29.119 align:start position:0%
operational I will tell you it hasn't
 
00:51:31.069 --> 00:51:31.079 align:start position:0%
been easy with under the existing rules
 
00:51:34.309 --> 00:51:34.319 align:start position:0%
I do believe that the proposed changes
 
00:51:38.030 --> 00:51:38.040 align:start position:0%
as originally uh issued would make it
 
00:51:42.030 --> 00:51:42.040 align:start position:0%
extremely difficult uh to build out what
 
00:51:45.030 --> 00:51:45.040 align:start position:0%
was currently permitted at that site uh
 
00:51:46.870 --> 00:51:46.880 align:start position:0%
We've expressed some of those concerns
 
00:51:48.430 --> 00:51:48.440 align:start position:0%
and some of the nuances and the rules
 
00:51:51.750 --> 00:51:51.760 align:start position:0%
and how we would interpret those um with
 
00:51:54.150 --> 00:51:54.160 align:start position:0%
the dees they understood the concerns
 
00:51:55.309 --> 00:51:55.319 align:start position:0%
we've had they've made some of the Chang
 
00:51:57.630 --> 00:51:57.640 align:start position:0%
changes they haven't made other changes
 
00:51:59.870 --> 00:51:59.880 align:start position:0%
um I will tell you I don't envy the
 
00:52:01.589 --> 00:52:01.599 align:start position:0%
position that Dees is in because I know
 
00:52:03.670 --> 00:52:03.680 align:start position:0%
they're hearing concerns and both side
 
00:52:05.190 --> 00:52:05.200 align:start position:0%
of the table and I think they're doing a
 
00:52:07.230 --> 00:52:07.240 align:start position:0%
great job I think director whims did an
 
00:52:09.829 --> 00:52:09.839 align:start position:0%
excellent job this morning really
 
00:52:12.030 --> 00:52:12.040 align:start position:0%
summarizing the process and what you
 
00:52:15.109 --> 00:52:15.119 align:start position:0%
know has gone on uh so I appreciate you
 
00:52:16.670 --> 00:52:16.680 align:start position:0%
know his willingness to at least listen
 
00:52:18.990 --> 00:52:19.000 align:start position:0%
to us even though you know they're not
 
00:52:20.829 --> 00:52:20.839 align:start position:0%
taking everything that we've requested
 
00:52:22.870 --> 00:52:22.880 align:start position:0%
under consideration I understand that to
 
00:52:25.990 --> 00:52:26.000 align:start position:0%
be the case so understood
 
00:52:28.829 --> 00:52:28.839 align:start position:0%
okay any any
 
00:52:28.839 --> 00:52:32.589 align:start position:0%
okay any any
questions

00:52:32.589 --> 00:52:32.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:35.349 --> 00:52:35.359 align:start position:0%
nope from your perspective in dealing
 
00:52:40.390 --> 00:52:40.400 align:start position:0%
with uh this issue overall are there any
 
00:52:43.309 --> 00:52:43.319 align:start position:0%
glaring areas that are going to break
 
00:52:45.910 --> 00:52:45.920 align:start position:0%
our waste management
 
00:52:48.990 --> 00:52:49.000 align:start position:0%
system I I don't I can't point to one
 
00:52:51.870 --> 00:52:51.880 align:start position:0%
specific item I think it's accumulation
 
00:52:55.470 --> 00:52:55.480 align:start position:0%
of changes that will um make go going
 
00:52:58.430 --> 00:52:58.440 align:start position:0%
forward extremely challenging uh for us
 
00:53:01.829 --> 00:53:01.839 align:start position:0%
and likely for others um you know we've
 
00:53:04.390 --> 00:53:04.400 align:start position:0%
looked at the property that we have out
 
00:53:07.549 --> 00:53:07.559 align:start position:0%
in Rochester currently what we own uh
 
00:53:09.789 --> 00:53:09.799 align:start position:0%
there is some limited capacity there to
 
00:53:12.309 --> 00:53:12.319 align:start position:0%
continue beyond the 23 for permanent
 
00:53:15.190 --> 00:53:15.200 align:start position:0%
sight life um under the current rules
 
00:53:17.589 --> 00:53:17.599 align:start position:0%
under the new rules um I think it's
 
00:53:19.390 --> 00:53:19.400 align:start position:0%
going to be really limited if we can
 
00:53:21.190 --> 00:53:21.200 align:start position:0%
continue to operate beyond that period
 
00:53:26.710 --> 00:53:26.720 align:start position:0%
of time um setback criteria sub surface
 
00:53:30.270 --> 00:53:30.280 align:start position:0%
conditions um you know limitations on
 
00:53:32.230 --> 00:53:32.240 align:start position:0%
vertical expansions a number of
 
00:53:33.670 --> 00:53:33.680 align:start position:0%
different things would you know
 
00:53:36.870 --> 00:53:36.880 align:start position:0%
accumulate to Mak uh continue to operate
 
00:53:39.349 --> 00:53:39.359 align:start position:0%
that site Beyond 20 34
 
00:53:41.349 --> 00:53:41.359 align:start position:0%
challenge um in fact there was an
 
00:53:42.549 --> 00:53:42.559 align:start position:0%
article on the front page of the
 
00:53:45.870 --> 00:53:45.880 align:start position:0%
fosterers yesterday citing this I've had
 
00:53:48.349 --> 00:53:48.359 align:start position:0%
conversations um with the city and they
 
00:53:51.109 --> 00:53:51.119 align:start position:0%
they've expressed some concern um but I
 
00:53:52.710 --> 00:53:52.720 align:start position:0%
said you know it is what it is we'll do
 
00:53:55.230 --> 00:53:55.240 align:start position:0%
the best we can but uh I can't guarantee
 
00:53:58.190 --> 00:53:58.200 align:start position:0%
that will be operational after
 
00:54:01.230 --> 00:54:01.240 align:start position:0%
2034 okay and
 
00:54:04.829 --> 00:54:04.839 align:start position:0%
um advice to this committee as
 
00:54:08.589 --> 00:54:08.599 align:start position:0%
we try to look at exactly protecting our
 
00:54:10.789 --> 00:54:10.799 align:start position:0%
environment protecting and preventing
 
00:54:13.069 --> 00:54:13.079 align:start position:0%
things that have happened in the past
 
00:54:15.510 --> 00:54:15.520 align:start position:0%
while allowing for a requirement for the
 
00:54:20.109 --> 00:54:20.119 align:start position:0%
state to have uh Waste Management
 
00:54:20.119 --> 00:54:21.710 align:start position:0%
state to have uh Waste Management
facilities

00:54:21.710 --> 00:54:21.720 align:start position:0%
facilities
 
00:54:24.349 --> 00:54:24.359 align:start position:0%
um what would is there anything that
 
00:54:25.910 --> 00:54:25.920 align:start position:0%
we're not looking at that we should be
 
00:54:28.589 --> 00:54:28.599 align:start position:0%
looking at I mean from a from a rule
 
00:54:31.349 --> 00:54:31.359 align:start position:0%
standpoint I would just recommend that
 
00:54:33.710 --> 00:54:33.720 align:start position:0%
you know the process that was outlined
 
00:54:35.829 --> 00:54:35.839 align:start position:0%
by director wisat this morning continue
 
00:54:38.870 --> 00:54:38.880 align:start position:0%
to move forward um you know that those
 
00:54:41.349 --> 00:54:41.359 align:start position:0%
rules will come out for public comment
 
00:54:43.470 --> 00:54:43.480 align:start position:0%
um they'll have additional comments that
 
00:54:45.829 --> 00:54:45.839 align:start position:0%
get submitted um and it'll go through
 
00:54:51.109 --> 00:54:51.119 align:start position:0%
that process I I I think they'll be um
 
00:54:52.789 --> 00:54:52.799 align:start position:0%
better from our perspective from what
 
00:54:56.549 --> 00:54:56.559 align:start position:0%
initially was submitted um it won't be
 
00:54:58.510 --> 00:54:58.520 align:start position:0%
where they're at for the you know
 
00:54:59.829 --> 00:54:59.839 align:start position:0%
relative to the rules that are in place
 
00:55:02.549 --> 00:55:02.559 align:start position:0%
today but um I don't know if I would
 
00:55:04.829 --> 00:55:04.839 align:start position:0%
recommend any changes at this point uh
 
00:55:08.069 --> 00:55:08.079 align:start position:0%
there's been a awful lot of work by uh
 
00:55:10.710 --> 00:55:10.720 align:start position:0%
Dees and their staff to work through the
 
00:55:13.270 --> 00:55:13.280 align:start position:0%
rules and make the changes um that folks
 
00:55:15.390 --> 00:55:15.400 align:start position:0%
have presented to them on both sides of
 
00:55:17.870 --> 00:55:17.880 align:start position:0%
the table so I at this point I don't
 
00:55:19.190 --> 00:55:19.200 align:start position:0%
think there's anything that I would you
 
00:55:21.390 --> 00:55:21.400 align:start position:0%
know change at this point I mean keeping
 
00:55:22.670 --> 00:55:22.680 align:start position:0%
the existing rules in place would be
 
00:55:23.870 --> 00:55:23.880 align:start position:0%
great we've been able to work through
 
00:55:25.549 --> 00:55:25.559 align:start position:0%
those but I know that
 
00:55:26.750 --> 00:55:26.760 align:start position:0%
uh there's pressure to make those
 
00:55:28.750 --> 00:55:28.760 align:start position:0%
changes or make some changes and I I
 
00:55:30.349 --> 00:55:30.359 align:start position:0%
think this state has heard those
 
00:55:32.109 --> 00:55:32.119 align:start position:0%
concerns and are making changes to try
 
00:55:33.950 --> 00:55:33.960 align:start position:0%
to address those issues that have been
 
00:55:37.789 --> 00:55:37.799 align:start position:0%
presented so and and representative H
 
00:55:40.109 --> 00:55:40.119 align:start position:0%
Haskins representative Penza have
 
00:55:42.950 --> 00:55:42.960 align:start position:0%
brought up quite a few questions really
 
00:55:45.390 --> 00:55:45.400 align:start position:0%
it's about public
 
00:55:49.589 --> 00:55:49.599 align:start position:0%
confidence and um clearly there's a
 
00:55:51.750 --> 00:55:51.760 align:start position:0%
large part of the public that that
 
00:55:54.270 --> 00:55:54.280 align:start position:0%
doesn't have confidence and so how would
 
00:55:56.309 --> 00:55:56.319 align:start position:0%
you address address that from
 
00:55:58.470 --> 00:55:58.480 align:start position:0%
a you know what would you say to that
 
00:55:59.910 --> 00:55:59.920 align:start position:0%
and how do how do you gain that
 
00:56:02.190 --> 00:56:02.200 align:start position:0%
confidence that what we're doing in fact
 
00:56:04.349 --> 00:56:04.359 align:start position:0%
will protect the public from any
 
00:56:07.029 --> 00:56:07.039 align:start position:0%
potential hazards yeah I I think you
 
00:56:08.829 --> 00:56:08.839 align:start position:0%
know from a permanent standpoint there's
 
00:56:12.069 --> 00:56:12.079 align:start position:0%
a public process that you know
 
00:56:13.789 --> 00:56:13.799 align:start position:0%
applications that get submitted get
 
00:56:16.549 --> 00:56:16.559 align:start position:0%
notified they're out for public comment
 
00:56:18.589 --> 00:56:18.599 align:start position:0%
they're made available in a public
 
00:56:21.990 --> 00:56:22.000 align:start position:0%
location at City Hall at a local library
 
00:56:24.349 --> 00:56:24.359 align:start position:0%
uh notifications are made to all the
 
00:56:24.359 --> 00:56:25.510 align:start position:0%
uh notifications are made to all the
butters

00:56:25.510 --> 00:56:25.520 align:start position:0%
butters
 
00:56:27.390 --> 00:56:27.400 align:start position:0%
uh it's published in a local and a
 
00:56:30.190 --> 00:56:30.200 align:start position:0%
Statewide permit uh public hearings are
 
00:56:32.670 --> 00:56:32.680 align:start position:0%
held at the local level uh and at the
 
00:56:35.950 --> 00:56:35.960 align:start position:0%
state level for any projects so there's
 
00:56:37.910 --> 00:56:37.920 align:start position:0%
you know there's opportunities for folks
 
00:56:40.630 --> 00:56:40.640 align:start position:0%
to weigh in address concerns that they
 
00:56:43.990 --> 00:56:44.000 align:start position:0%
have through both of those processes so
 
00:56:47.390 --> 00:56:47.400 align:start position:0%
um you know I I I know there's concern
 
00:56:50.910 --> 00:56:50.920 align:start position:0%
on some facilities uh in the state but
 
00:56:52.870 --> 00:56:52.880 align:start position:0%
you know that's you know we're we're
 
00:56:55.549 --> 00:56:55.559 align:start position:0%
seeing the impact on our our operations
 
00:56:58.589 --> 00:56:58.599 align:start position:0%
and trying to protect what we're doing
 
00:57:00.589 --> 00:57:00.599 align:start position:0%
um but I understand there's concerns
 
00:57:01.990 --> 00:57:02.000 align:start position:0%
with other things that are going on
 
00:57:05.230 --> 00:57:05.240 align:start position:0%
Statewide so okay are there any
 
00:57:08.870 --> 00:57:08.880 align:start position:0%
questions any other questions no I have
 
00:57:10.470 --> 00:57:10.480 align:start position:0%
I have a question for the Department
 
00:57:11.910 --> 00:57:11.920 align:start position:0%
okay thank you sir I appreciate you
 
00:57:13.470 --> 00:57:13.480 align:start position:0%
coming up and taking the time today very
 
00:57:16.430 --> 00:57:16.440 align:start position:0%
helpful thank you and Mr whms you got we
 
00:57:20.349 --> 00:57:20.359 align:start position:0%
got about two minutes for one
 
00:57:23.349 --> 00:57:23.359 align:start position:0%
question for one question well until we
 
00:57:25.230 --> 00:57:25.240 align:start position:0%
run out of time and then we will have
 
00:57:25.240 --> 00:57:27.510 align:start position:0%
run out of time and then we will have
another

00:57:27.510 --> 00:57:27.520 align:start position:0%
another
 
00:57:29.549 --> 00:57:29.559 align:start position:0%
session I don't know I just have to go
 
00:57:31.870 --> 00:57:31.880 align:start position:0%
back to Optics the Optics of this whole
 
00:57:35.349 --> 00:57:35.359 align:start position:0%
thing is is is um is quite upsetting
 
00:57:38.309 --> 00:57:38.319 align:start position:0%
like I'm kind of stunned we basically
 
00:57:42.190 --> 00:57:42.200 align:start position:0%
have just had all this testimony of yes
 
00:57:44.309 --> 00:57:44.319 align:start position:0%
of the only people that you've met with
 
00:57:46.670 --> 00:57:46.680 align:start position:0%
pretty much since October or heard from
 
00:57:49.150 --> 00:57:49.160 align:start position:0%
and then the council are all the
 
00:57:52.750 --> 00:57:52.760 align:start position:0%
industry they're and then we have no
 
00:57:54.390 --> 00:57:54.400 align:start position:0%
disrespect but we have an industry
 
00:57:54.400 --> 00:57:55.470 align:start position:0%
disrespect but we have an industry
person

00:57:55.470 --> 00:57:55.480 align:start position:0%
person
 
00:57:56.910 --> 00:57:56.920 align:start position:0%
you know from Waste Management to come
 
00:57:59.150 --> 00:57:59.160 align:start position:0%
speak why aren't we having a
 
00:58:02.470 --> 00:58:02.480 align:start position:0%
hydrogeologist come talk to us I mean
 
00:58:05.750 --> 00:58:05.760 align:start position:0%
the rules have become weaker and
 
00:58:08.750 --> 00:58:08.760 align:start position:0%
weaker and and that's that's that's a
 
00:58:11.630 --> 00:58:11.640 align:start position:0%
good thing I protective if we're going
 
00:58:14.430 --> 00:58:14.440 align:start position:0%
to be protective it makes sense you made
 
00:58:16.349 --> 00:58:16.359 align:start position:0%
a statement about Massachusetts they
 
00:58:18.109 --> 00:58:18.119 align:start position:0%
have like a full moratorium we're taking
 
00:58:20.109 --> 00:58:20.119 align:start position:0%
an out of state trash pretend to the
 
00:58:23.069 --> 00:58:23.079 align:start position:0%
question please so how is it that we're
 
00:58:25.470 --> 00:58:25.480 align:start position:0%
saying that we're doing good things and
 
00:58:27.750 --> 00:58:27.760 align:start position:0%
all of that you make examples of U
 
00:58:29.390 --> 00:58:29.400 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and stuff and we're taking
 
00:58:32.150 --> 00:58:32.160 align:start position:0%
an out of state trash from them so our
 
00:58:33.549 --> 00:58:33.559 align:start position:0%
rules that are weaker are going to take
 
00:58:35.549 --> 00:58:35.559 align:start position:0%
in more trash from other states that
 
00:58:36.870 --> 00:58:36.880 align:start position:0%
have stricter
 
00:58:39.230 --> 00:58:39.240 align:start position:0%
things don't you think that that's
 
00:58:41.069 --> 00:58:41.079 align:start position:0%
that's what's happening aren't we going
 
00:58:42.510 --> 00:58:42.520 align:start position:0%
to just take in more trash from other
 
00:58:45.069 --> 00:58:45.079 align:start position:0%
people because our we're talking about
 
00:58:48.309 --> 00:58:48.319 align:start position:0%
the rules for site locations that's the
 
00:58:50.470 --> 00:58:50.480 align:start position:0%
that's what this subcommittee is about
 
00:58:52.309 --> 00:58:52.319 align:start position:0%
that's so the questioning should be
 
00:58:55.190 --> 00:58:55.200 align:start position:0%
along the lines of the rules for site
 
00:58:55.200 --> 00:59:02.029 align:start position:0%
along the lines of the rules for site
location

00:59:02.029 --> 00:59:02.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:05.309 --> 00:59:05.319 align:start position:0%
please right now our rules are hundreds
 
00:59:07.549 --> 00:59:07.559 align:start position:0%
of times weaker and they've been made
 
00:59:07.559 --> 00:59:09.270 align:start position:0%
of times weaker and they've been made
that

00:59:09.270 --> 00:59:09.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:59:13.029 --> 00:59:13.039 align:start position:0%
progressively so in us saying not
 
00:59:15.349 --> 00:59:15.359 align:start position:0%
looking at other states well aren't we
 
00:59:16.710 --> 00:59:16.720 align:start position:0%
going to have to look at other states if
 
00:59:19.710 --> 00:59:19.720 align:start position:0%
our aate trash is almost at 50% at this
 
00:59:21.910 --> 00:59:21.920 align:start position:0%
point why aren't we looking at that if
 
00:59:23.789 --> 00:59:23.799 align:start position:0%
we're making our rules weaker then we're
 
00:59:29.390 --> 00:59:29.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:31.510 --> 00:59:31.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I'm not sure what the question
 
00:59:35.109 --> 00:59:35.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:37.870 --> 00:59:37.880 align:start position:0%
question representative
 
00:59:41.069 --> 00:59:41.079 align:start position:0%
Murray uh thank you um director can you
 
00:59:44.950 --> 00:59:44.960 align:start position:0%
speak to the waste disposal hierarchy
 
00:59:48.069 --> 00:59:48.079 align:start position:0%
and whether or not that is something
 
00:59:51.270 --> 00:59:51.280 align:start position:0%
that we we have looked at that topic uh
 
00:59:54.950 --> 00:59:54.960 align:start position:0%
in committees throughout this
 
00:59:56.789 --> 00:59:56.799 align:start position:0%
environment and agriculture swag has
 
00:59:58.069 --> 00:59:58.079 align:start position:0%
looked at those Solid Waste working
 
01:00:01.150 --> 01:00:01.160 align:start position:0%
group as well do does the data that
 
01:00:03.829 --> 01:00:03.839 align:start position:0%
comes from how
 
01:00:03.839 --> 01:00:05.710 align:start position:0%
comes from how
we

01:00:05.710 --> 01:00:05.720 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:00:08.150 --> 01:00:08.160 align:start position:0%
uh at what rate we are landfilling
 
01:00:11.349 --> 01:00:11.359 align:start position:0%
versus other methods affect how you look
 
01:00:13.470 --> 01:00:13.480 align:start position:0%
at the
 
01:00:16.230 --> 01:00:16.240 align:start position:0%
rules I think it's fair well I will say
 
01:00:17.630 --> 01:00:17.640 align:start position:0%
that you know one of the things that I
 
01:00:19.230 --> 01:00:19.240 align:start position:0%
think has been a source of frustration
 
01:00:21.029 --> 01:00:21.039 align:start position:0%
for the public and for the legislature
 
01:00:23.870 --> 01:00:23.880 align:start position:0%
is that um we continue you know our if
 
01:00:26.829 --> 01:00:26.839 align:start position:0%
you look at the port P folio of uh
 
01:00:28.750 --> 01:00:28.760 align:start position:0%
facilities that accept Solid Waste in
 
01:00:30.870 --> 01:00:30.880 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire the line share of the
 
01:00:33.589 --> 01:00:33.599 align:start position:0%
waste um gets landfilled and of course
 
01:00:35.069 --> 01:00:35.079 align:start position:0%
it's been pointed out many times that
 
01:00:36.829 --> 01:00:36.839 align:start position:0%
landfilling is on the bottom of the
 
01:00:39.789 --> 01:00:39.799 align:start position:0%
hierarchy we have U you know worked as
 
01:00:41.390 --> 01:00:41.400 align:start position:0%
best we could to try to encourage other
 
01:00:43.710 --> 01:00:43.720 align:start position:0%
types of facilities we don't propose
 
01:00:45.870 --> 01:00:45.880 align:start position:0%
facilities we don't propose to construct
 
01:00:48.349 --> 01:00:48.359 align:start position:0%
and operate facilities we receive permit
 
01:00:51.029 --> 01:00:51.039 align:start position:0%
applications from those who wish to do
 
01:00:53.029 --> 01:00:53.039 align:start position:0%
and we are Duty bound to process those
 
01:00:55.910 --> 01:00:55.920 align:start position:0%
permit applications I am happy to report
 
01:00:58.349 --> 01:00:58.359 align:start position:0%
that through um some legislative action
 
01:01:00.390 --> 01:01:00.400 align:start position:0%
within the last couple of years we've
 
01:01:02.270 --> 01:01:02.280 align:start position:0%
made some good progress on looking at
 
01:01:03.910 --> 01:01:03.920 align:start position:0%
Food waste and organic waste which
 
01:01:06.390 --> 01:01:06.400 align:start position:0%
comprises a very significant portion of
 
01:01:09.470 --> 01:01:09.480 align:start position:0%
mssw that goes into landfills and um we
 
01:01:11.069 --> 01:01:11.079 align:start position:0%
actually uh just within the last few
 
01:01:13.630 --> 01:01:13.640 align:start position:0%
weeks received an application for an
 
01:01:16.270 --> 01:01:16.280 align:start position:0%
Organics waste facility um not a
 
01:01:19.390 --> 01:01:19.400 align:start position:0%
landfill um in the seast region so
 
01:01:22.589 --> 01:01:22.599 align:start position:0%
that's a positive um a very positive
 
01:01:24.789 --> 01:01:24.799 align:start position:0%
development something we've not seen yet
 
01:01:27.349 --> 01:01:27.359 align:start position:0%
so uh we are making uh incremental
 
01:01:29.390 --> 01:01:29.400 align:start position:0%
progress in that regard and we hope to
 
01:01:31.430 --> 01:01:31.440 align:start position:0%
make certainly a lot more as as this
 
01:01:34.670 --> 01:01:34.680 align:start position:0%
committee knows we've uh uh implemented
 
01:01:36.190 --> 01:01:36.200 align:start position:0%
uh developed and published and are
 
01:01:37.910 --> 01:01:37.920 align:start position:0%
implementing a 10year solid waste
 
01:01:41.029 --> 01:01:41.039 align:start position:0%
management plan um that has this as many
 
01:01:43.390 --> 01:01:43.400 align:start position:0%
of its goals to expand on that you and
 
01:01:45.349 --> 01:01:45.359 align:start position:0%
to improve our position in the hierarchy
 
01:01:46.990 --> 01:01:47.000 align:start position:0%
if you will and I think we're going to
 
01:01:48.549 --> 01:01:48.559 align:start position:0%
make great progress there but we we
 
01:01:50.190 --> 01:01:50.200 align:start position:0%
still have an A we clearly have a lot of
 
01:01:54.789 --> 01:01:54.799 align:start position:0%
work to do thank you very okay thank you
 
01:01:56.950 --> 01:01:56.960 align:start position:0%

might want to have another session
 
01:02:06.109 --> 01:02:06.119 align:start position:0%
sooner rather than later if you're okay

one question represent
 
01:02:22.109 --> 01:02:22.119 align:start position:0%
Penza so your comment regarding the
 
01:02:25.630 --> 01:02:25.640 align:start position:0%
waste management Council I think it it
 
01:02:27.670 --> 01:02:27.680 align:start position:0%
has a lot of Merit and what I'd like to
 
01:02:31.950 --> 01:02:31.960 align:start position:0%
do is send a note from the subcommittee
 
01:02:34.390 --> 01:02:34.400 align:start position:0%
as a highlighted weakness to the
 
01:02:37.269 --> 01:02:37.279 align:start position:0%
executive Council and and just send it
 
01:02:38.789 --> 01:02:38.799 align:start position:0%
straight to them and say Hey listen
 
01:02:41.190 --> 01:02:41.200 align:start position:0%
we're really not happy with this because
 
01:02:44.349 --> 01:02:44.359 align:start position:0%
we're only getting one side of the would
 
01:02:45.990 --> 01:02:46.000 align:start position:0%
you help me craft
 
01:02:48.309 --> 01:02:48.319 align:start position:0%
that and because that I think that's the
 
01:02:51.789 --> 01:02:51.799 align:start position:0%
way to you're exactly right on the issue
 
01:02:53.309 --> 01:02:53.319 align:start position:0%
but I think the best way to handle that
 
01:02:55.349 --> 01:02:55.359 align:start position:0%
is through the executive Council who's
 
01:02:56.990 --> 01:02:57.000 align:start position:0%
the one that's supposed to fill those
 
01:02:59.829 --> 01:02:59.839 align:start position:0%
slots so if you help me out with that
 
01:03:02.510 --> 01:03:02.520 align:start position:0%
then I think that would be helpful thank
 
01:03:05.870 --> 01:03:05.880 align:start position:0%
you any uh further questions great thank
 
01:03:23.269 --> 01:03:23.279 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:23.279 --> 01:07:44.910 align:start position:0%
 
target

01:07:44.910 --> 01:07:44.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:47.630 --> 01:07:47.640 align:start position:0%
okay uh we want to get underway here
 
01:07:52.910 --> 01:07:52.920 align:start position:0%

01:09:31.829 --> 01:09:31.839 align:start position:0%
okay good morning everybody and welcome
 
01:09:34.470 --> 01:09:34.480 align:start position:0%
to environment and agriculture uh 10
 
01:09:36.630 --> 01:09:36.640 align:start position:0%
o'clock we were supposed to start with a
 
01:09:38.910 --> 01:09:38.920 align:start position:0%
work session where the committee is
 
01:09:41.709 --> 01:09:41.719 align:start position:0%
going to discuss three bills HB 1102
 
01:09:47.030 --> 01:09:47.040 align:start position:0%
which we heard yesterday HB 1145 and hb1
 
01:09:50.669 --> 01:09:50.679 align:start position:0%
1632 um I I actually prefer to start
 
01:09:52.709 --> 01:09:52.719 align:start position:0%
with um HB
 
01:09:56.149 --> 01:09:56.159 align:start position:0%
1145 which is uh one of the landfill
 
01:09:59.830 --> 01:09:59.840 align:start position:0%
bills um we didn't really have much time
 
01:10:02.990 --> 01:10:03.000 align:start position:0%
to talk about that particular bill it's
 
01:10:05.590 --> 01:10:05.600 align:start position:0%
um prohibiting the private ownership of
 
01:10:09.630 --> 01:10:09.640 align:start position:0%
landfills and I kind of like to get uh
 
01:10:12.110 --> 01:10:12.120 align:start position:0%
some thoughts from the committee
 
01:10:14.630 --> 01:10:14.640 align:start position:0%
regarding that bill um I guess the
 
01:10:17.669 --> 01:10:17.679 align:start position:0%
premise of the bill was so that we could
 
01:10:20.870 --> 01:10:20.880 align:start position:0%
limit the amount of out ofate trash
 
01:10:25.590 --> 01:10:25.600 align:start position:0%
coming into the state um and I don't
 
01:10:28.950 --> 01:10:28.960 align:start position:0%
know does anybody have any um initial
 
01:10:30.550 --> 01:10:30.560 align:start position:0%
thoughts on that particular
 
01:10:35.070 --> 01:10:35.080 align:start position:0%
bill um yes repr Bixby um well not
 
01:10:38.189 --> 01:10:38.199 align:start position:0%
surprisingly I support the bill
 
01:10:43.590 --> 01:10:43.600 align:start position:0%
yeah um and uh so
 
01:10:46.790 --> 01:10:46.800 align:start position:0%
uh one of the key things about uh one of
 
01:10:49.310 --> 01:10:49.320 align:start position:0%
the key differences between um a
 
01:10:51.110 --> 01:10:51.120 align:start position:0%
landfill being privately owned versus
 
01:10:53.110 --> 01:10:53.120 align:start position:0%
publicly owned is that if it is publicly
 
01:10:53.120 --> 01:10:54.630 align:start position:0%
publicly owned is that if it is publicly
owned

01:10:54.630 --> 01:10:54.640 align:start position:0%
owned
 
01:10:58.350 --> 01:10:58.360 align:start position:0%
then the uh the public body whether it's
 
01:11:01.709 --> 01:11:01.719 align:start position:0%
the state or the county or municipality
 
01:11:06.189 --> 01:11:06.199 align:start position:0%
or a um or solid waste District uh would
 
01:11:10.870 --> 01:11:10.880 align:start position:0%
have the ability to uh make the
 
01:11:13.709 --> 01:11:13.719 align:start position:0%
essentially uh determine the rules for
 
01:11:15.990 --> 01:11:16.000 align:start position:0%
what can and can't go into the landfill
 
01:11:19.630 --> 01:11:19.640 align:start position:0%
and where that comes from so
 
01:11:24.630 --> 01:11:24.640 align:start position:0%
um one of the issues with the um
 
01:11:27.470 --> 01:11:27.480 align:start position:0%
with private landfills is that uh
 
01:11:28.990 --> 01:11:29.000 align:start position:0%
because of the interstate commerce
 
01:11:33.790 --> 01:11:33.800 align:start position:0%
clause there are uh real limits in terms
 
01:11:37.149 --> 01:11:37.159 align:start position:0%
of what a what restrictions can be put
 
01:11:41.550 --> 01:11:41.560 align:start position:0%
on on the type of waste and on the uh
 
01:11:43.669 --> 01:11:43.679 align:start position:0%
the source of waste that can be that can
 
01:11:50.510 --> 01:11:50.520 align:start position:0%
go into it uh so uh any um any rule that
 
01:11:53.149 --> 01:11:53.159 align:start position:0%
uh for for public for privately owned
 
01:11:55.990 --> 01:11:56.000 align:start position:0%
landfill any rule that the state uh puts
 
01:11:59.189 --> 01:11:59.199 align:start position:0%
on the landfill needs to be applied
 
01:12:02.709 --> 01:12:02.719 align:start position:0%
equally to both instate and outof state
 
01:12:08.310 --> 01:12:08.320 align:start position:0%
waste and which means that uh there is
 
01:12:13.270 --> 01:12:13.280 align:start position:0%
uh very limited very limited capacity to
 
01:12:17.510 --> 01:12:17.520 align:start position:0%
uh to block out ofate waste uh and uh we
 
01:12:20.270 --> 01:12:20.280 align:start position:0%
heard uh relative to the other bill that
 
01:12:24.110 --> 01:12:24.120 align:start position:0%
we um that we heard along with this
 
01:12:28.229 --> 01:12:28.239 align:start position:0%
that there may be uh some capacity to
 
01:12:33.709 --> 01:12:33.719 align:start position:0%
say block as much waste in as an equal
 
01:12:35.390 --> 01:12:35.400 align:start position:0%
percentage of the waste coming into the
 
01:12:38.669 --> 01:12:38.679 align:start position:0%
state as we sent out of the state but
 
01:12:40.350 --> 01:12:40.360 align:start position:0%
that would still mean that we we would
 
01:12:44.750 --> 01:12:44.760 align:start position:0%
be forced to take at least uh as much as
 
01:12:46.950 --> 01:12:46.960 align:start position:0%
perhaps 15% of out ofate waste we
 
01:12:49.310 --> 01:12:49.320 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be able to uh restrict it
 
01:12:51.390 --> 01:12:51.400 align:start position:0%
further than that the other thing is we
 
01:12:52.990 --> 01:12:53.000 align:start position:0%
would not be able to make differential
 
01:12:55.470 --> 01:12:55.480 align:start position:0%
fees between in instate and out ofate
 
01:12:59.070 --> 01:12:59.080 align:start position:0%
waste uh we would not be able to uh
 
01:13:02.189 --> 01:13:02.199 align:start position:0%
block specific items coming from out of
 
01:13:04.750 --> 01:13:04.760 align:start position:0%
state unless we also block those from
 
01:13:10.310 --> 01:13:10.320 align:start position:0%
instate so um and so there there are uh
 
01:13:14.229 --> 01:13:14.239 align:start position:0%
all sorts of uh restrictions in terms of
 
01:13:17.189 --> 01:13:17.199 align:start position:0%
what we C the the degree to which we can
 
01:13:20.149 --> 01:13:20.159 align:start position:0%
control the waste going into landfills
 
01:13:22.629 --> 01:13:22.639 align:start position:0%
if it's coming from if we if we're
 
01:13:25.709 --> 01:13:25.719 align:start position:0%
talking about a private landfill uh if
 
01:13:28.790 --> 01:13:28.800 align:start position:0%
we have a public landfill then we have
 
01:13:31.750 --> 01:13:31.760 align:start position:0%
the capacity to make the laws and rules
 
01:13:33.390 --> 01:13:33.400 align:start position:0%
that govern everything that goes into
 
01:13:39.950 --> 01:13:39.960 align:start position:0%
that landfill and that uh given that uh
 
01:13:39.960 --> 01:13:41.510 align:start position:0%
that landfill and that uh given that uh
our

01:13:41.510 --> 01:13:41.520 align:start position:0%
our
 
01:13:44.910 --> 01:13:44.920 align:start position:0%
um our envir our natural environment is
 
01:13:46.870 --> 01:13:46.880 align:start position:0%
one of our most important resources in
 
01:13:50.350 --> 01:13:50.360 align:start position:0%
this state it drives tourism it drives
 
01:13:53.470 --> 01:13:53.480 align:start position:0%
uh our capacity to provide safe drinking
 
01:13:57.229 --> 01:13:57.239 align:start position:0%
water safe air Etc to the uh the people
 
01:14:02.030 --> 01:14:02.040 align:start position:0%
in our in the State uh being able to put
 
01:14:04.110 --> 01:14:04.120 align:start position:0%
in place rules that are sufficiently
 
01:14:09.189 --> 01:14:09.199 align:start position:0%
protective is important for um for our
 
01:14:12.470 --> 01:14:12.480 align:start position:0%
uh longterm long-term sustainability as
 
01:14:18.310 --> 01:14:18.320 align:start position:0%
as a state both economically and um and
 
01:14:20.189 --> 01:14:20.199 align:start position:0%
uh environmentally and in terms of
 
01:14:24.910 --> 01:14:24.920 align:start position:0%
health so I think that putting making it
 
01:14:28.510 --> 01:14:28.520 align:start position:0%
so that any future landfill would be
 
01:14:32.709 --> 01:14:32.719 align:start position:0%
publicly owned is a um is an important
 
01:14:34.310 --> 01:14:34.320 align:start position:0%
step to take the other thing that we
 
01:14:36.510 --> 01:14:36.520 align:start position:0%
need to consider is that we aren't going
 
01:14:38.870 --> 01:14:38.880 align:start position:0%
to be having very many new landfills we
 
01:14:43.550 --> 01:14:43.560 align:start position:0%
already have capacity through uh
 
01:14:48.229 --> 01:14:48.239 align:start position:0%
3035 and that doesn't include the likely
 
01:14:50.669 --> 01:14:50.679 align:start position:0%
expansions that can that can happen at
 
01:14:54.189 --> 01:14:54.199 align:start position:0%
the existing landfills um
 
01:14:59.229 --> 01:14:59.239 align:start position:0%
so uh so the uh so I think that um the
 
01:15:02.550 --> 01:15:02.560 align:start position:0%
idea that this is somehow going to um
 
01:15:04.910 --> 01:15:04.920 align:start position:0%
restrict all sorts of commercial
 
01:15:08.830 --> 01:15:08.840 align:start position:0%
possibilities is um not really a major
 
01:15:12.950 --> 01:15:12.960 align:start position:0%
factor so my my question though is
 
01:15:15.030 --> 01:15:15.040 align:start position:0%
there's nothing in State Statute now
 
01:15:19.830 --> 01:15:19.840 align:start position:0%
that prohibits the state from opening a
 
01:15:22.590 --> 01:15:22.600 align:start position:0%
landfill that's correct the state could
 
01:15:28.470 --> 01:15:28.480 align:start position:0%
open a land fill uh but uh the
 
01:15:31.790 --> 01:15:31.800 align:start position:0%
um but that also doesn't create that
 
01:15:35.950 --> 01:15:35.960 align:start position:0%
also um doesn't prevent new public land
 
01:15:37.550 --> 01:15:37.560 align:start position:0%
new private landfills from being
 
01:15:44.430 --> 01:15:44.440 align:start position:0%
proposed and permitted and uh the I so
 
01:15:47.669 --> 01:15:47.679 align:start position:0%
uh in order to
 
01:15:52.470 --> 01:15:52.480 align:start position:0%
um in order so uh if we do not want to
 
01:15:55.229 --> 01:15:55.239 align:start position:0%
have a situation where we have another
 
01:15:57.350 --> 01:15:57.360 align:start position:0%
uh public privately owned landfill in
 
01:16:01.270 --> 01:16:01.280 align:start position:0%
the state then uh we need then we need
 
01:16:03.830 --> 01:16:03.840 align:start position:0%
to have a Prohibition on on new
 
01:16:05.070 --> 01:16:05.080 align:start position:0%
privately owned
 
01:16:10.310 --> 01:16:10.320 align:start position:0%
landfills uh and uh so that
 
01:16:13.550 --> 01:16:13.560 align:start position:0%
um so that yes it is possible for a
 
01:16:16.870 --> 01:16:16.880 align:start position:0%
municipality or or the state or a county
 
01:16:20.550 --> 01:16:20.560 align:start position:0%
to um to come up with its own propos
 
01:16:22.270 --> 01:16:22.280 align:start position:0%
proposal for landfill and it would have
 
01:16:25.270 --> 01:16:25.280 align:start position:0%
to meet all of the necessary permitting
 
01:16:30.590 --> 01:16:30.600 align:start position:0%
requirements that uh Dees now has but uh
 
01:16:34.750 --> 01:16:34.760 align:start position:0%
the but I think that um having those
 
01:16:34.760 --> 01:16:35.750 align:start position:0%
the but I think that um having those
things

01:16:35.750 --> 01:16:35.760 align:start position:0%
things
 
01:16:38.910 --> 01:16:38.920 align:start position:0%
under uh state or County or Municipal
 
01:16:42.550 --> 01:16:42.560 align:start position:0%
control gives the gives us the capacity
 
01:16:44.629 --> 01:16:44.639 align:start position:0%
to control what's coming in from out of
 
01:16:46.910 --> 01:16:46.920 align:start position:0%
state in a way that we never would have
 
01:16:49.990 --> 01:16:50.000 align:start position:0%
with a private land F Well no I I
 
01:16:53.350 --> 01:16:53.360 align:start position:0%
understand the premise of the differ
 
01:16:56.070 --> 01:16:56.080 align:start position:0%
between you know how we can control a
 
01:16:59.910 --> 01:16:59.920 align:start position:0%
publicly owned landfill as opposed to a
 
01:17:02.350 --> 01:17:02.360 align:start position:0%
privately owned landfill in terms of the
 
01:17:04.709 --> 01:17:04.719 align:start position:0%
Commerce Clause and what we can accept
 
01:17:06.709 --> 01:17:06.719 align:start position:0%
as from out of state trash and what we
 
01:17:09.950 --> 01:17:09.960 align:start position:0%
can charge for it and all of that but my
 
01:17:12.030 --> 01:17:12.040 align:start position:0%
I I still contend that I mean if the
 
01:17:15.110 --> 01:17:15.120 align:start position:0%
state believes that it's
 
01:17:19.629 --> 01:17:19.639 align:start position:0%
um sort of a a priority to eliminate uh
 
01:17:21.709 --> 01:17:21.719 align:start position:0%
as much out of state
 
01:17:24.709 --> 01:17:24.719 align:start position:0%
trash then I would think that you know
 
01:17:28.149 --> 01:17:28.159 align:start position:0%
they would have the impetus to want
 
01:17:32.110 --> 01:17:32.120 align:start position:0%
to establish a public
 
01:17:34.390 --> 01:17:34.400 align:start position:0%
landfill I could do
 
01:17:37.350 --> 01:17:37.360 align:start position:0%
that I could do
 
01:17:37.360 --> 01:17:39.270 align:start position:0%
that I could do
that

01:17:39.270 --> 01:17:39.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:17:42.030 --> 01:17:42.040 align:start position:0%
um but my point is that I mean there's
 
01:17:44.110 --> 01:17:44.120 align:start position:0%
nothing that prohibits the state from
 
01:17:46.110 --> 01:17:46.120 align:start position:0%
from going ahead and doing this as
 
01:17:48.910 --> 01:17:48.920 align:start position:0%
opposed to Banning private
 
01:17:52.669 --> 01:17:52.679 align:start position:0%
ownership uh of a landfill I mean we
 
01:17:54.790 --> 01:17:54.800 align:start position:0%
presum presumably what you want to do is
 
01:17:59.270 --> 01:17:59.280 align:start position:0%
is compel the state to then establish
 
01:18:02.350 --> 01:18:02.360 align:start position:0%
future landfills only if there is a
 
01:18:04.669 --> 01:18:04.679 align:start position:0%
capacity need that is not being filled
 
01:18:07.669 --> 01:18:07.679 align:start position:0%
and right and it is also possible that
 
01:18:10.270 --> 01:18:10.280 align:start position:0%
there may be other municipalities or
 
01:18:13.550 --> 01:18:13.560 align:start position:0%
counties that would uh feel that it
 
01:18:16.470 --> 01:18:16.480 align:start position:0%
would be to their advantage to uh to
 
01:18:19.550 --> 01:18:19.560 align:start position:0%
establish their own landfill uh and we
 
01:18:21.270 --> 01:18:21.280 align:start position:0%
have several
 
01:18:23.990 --> 01:18:24.000 align:start position:0%
successful uh municipally owned
 
01:18:26.310 --> 01:18:26.320 align:start position:0%
landfills I four out of the six of the
 
01:18:27.950 --> 01:18:27.960 align:start position:0%
operating landfills right now are
 
01:18:30.790 --> 01:18:30.800 align:start position:0%
municipally owned and they are doing a
 
01:18:34.910 --> 01:18:34.920 align:start position:0%
very good job uh so um are they do you
 
01:18:36.550 --> 01:18:36.560 align:start position:0%
know if they're limiting how much out of
 
01:18:38.070 --> 01:18:38.080 align:start position:0%
state trash they're taking
 
01:18:44.270 --> 01:18:44.280 align:start position:0%
in yes n yeah um so in nashaa does I
 
01:18:48.709 --> 01:18:48.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:53.550 --> 01:18:53.560 align:start position:0%
and put your mic uh they police it um
 
01:18:55.750 --> 01:18:55.760 align:start position:0%
especially on Saturdays so that people
 
01:18:58.070 --> 01:18:58.080 align:start position:0%
can't come from other communities and
 
01:19:00.350 --> 01:19:00.360 align:start position:0%
dump their trash in
 
01:19:04.110 --> 01:19:04.120 align:start position:0%
nashwa so um representative Howard um
 
01:19:07.270 --> 01:19:07.280 align:start position:0%
two points um I think that uh that if we
 
01:19:09.350 --> 01:19:09.360 align:start position:0%
were to have only state run we would
 
01:19:11.950 --> 01:19:11.960 align:start position:0%
eliminate the comp competition from um
 
01:19:13.430 --> 01:19:13.440 align:start position:0%
which you know I know is a little bit
 
01:19:16.470 --> 01:19:16.480 align:start position:0%
anema to uh to um one side of the aisle
 
01:19:18.910 --> 01:19:18.920 align:start position:0%
here but um I also think that the
 
01:19:21.430 --> 01:19:21.440 align:start position:0%
business proposition that one of the the
 
01:19:23.830 --> 01:19:23.840 align:start position:0%
naysayers against this was the business
 
01:19:27.550 --> 01:19:27.560 align:start position:0%
um community and um I I still don't I
 
01:19:30.229 --> 01:19:30.239 align:start position:0%
would still believe that not all
 
01:19:32.950 --> 01:19:32.960 align:start position:0%
business opportunities are equal and and
 
01:19:36.189 --> 01:19:36.199 align:start position:0%
we would be in better hands um if the
 
01:19:37.790 --> 01:19:37.800 align:start position:0%
state was running it especially if it if
 
01:19:41.709 --> 01:19:41.719 align:start position:0%
it overrides the Commerce um
 
01:19:44.310 --> 01:19:44.320 align:start position:0%
laws representative H Haskins thank you
 
01:19:47.510 --> 01:19:47.520 align:start position:0%
madam chair there's a reason why we
 
01:19:49.910 --> 01:19:49.920 align:start position:0%
haven't done this why the state hasn't
 
01:19:52.910 --> 01:19:52.920 align:start position:0%
come up with it this is a billion dollar
 
01:19:55.030 --> 01:19:55.040 align:start position:0%
industry they are not interested in
 
01:19:59.270 --> 01:19:59.280 align:start position:0%
local control it you know it is very
 
01:20:03.510 --> 01:20:03.520 align:start position:0%
hard to compete in the laws and rules as
 
01:20:05.950 --> 01:20:05.960 align:start position:0%
are currently constructed and I agree
 
01:20:09.390 --> 01:20:09.400 align:start position:0%
with everything that um rep Bixby said
 
01:20:12.750 --> 01:20:12.760 align:start position:0%
and I can't improve on it I think local
 
01:20:15.310 --> 01:20:15.320 align:start position:0%
control is very important and we don't
 
01:20:17.629 --> 01:20:17.639 align:start position:0%
have it
 
01:20:22.590 --> 01:20:22.600 align:start position:0%
now okay represent Duty uh thank you um
 
01:20:27.629 --> 01:20:27.639 align:start position:0%
I I wish I could um cite the article um
 
01:20:30.110 --> 01:20:30.120 align:start position:0%
verbatim but I can't but I was reading
 
01:20:34.910 --> 01:20:34.920 align:start position:0%
an article uh recently and the way it we
 
01:20:38.990 --> 01:20:39.000 align:start position:0%
stacked up in the negative um regarding
 
01:20:41.950 --> 01:20:41.960 align:start position:0%
landfilling and recycling we were number
 
01:20:45.990 --> 01:20:46.000 align:start position:0%
11 in the negative Connecticut
 
01:20:49.709 --> 01:20:49.719 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts Vermont and Maine and
 
01:20:52.030 --> 01:20:52.040 align:start position:0%
possibly even Rhode Island were all in
 
01:20:55.750 --> 01:20:55.760 align:start position:0%
the positive they were like number 46 47
 
01:21:01.350 --> 01:21:01.360 align:start position:0%
48 and 49 in the positive in terms of uh
 
01:21:05.270 --> 01:21:05.280 align:start position:0%
limiting e either limiting the amount of
 
01:21:07.750 --> 01:21:07.760 align:start position:0%
landfilling that they're doing or
 
01:21:09.830 --> 01:21:09.840 align:start position:0%
improving the amount of recycling
 
01:21:12.590 --> 01:21:12.600 align:start position:0%
they're doing okay that's number one
 
01:21:15.350 --> 01:21:15.360 align:start position:0%
secondly um I went to a conference on
 
01:21:18.110 --> 01:21:18.120 align:start position:0%
Monday there were people there from all
 
01:21:21.070 --> 01:21:21.080 align:start position:0%
across the country and when they found
 
01:21:22.830 --> 01:21:22.840 align:start position:0%
out that I was from New Hampshire what
 
01:21:25.629 --> 01:21:25.639 align:start position:0%
do you think the first thing they said
 
01:21:28.149 --> 01:21:28.159 align:start position:0%
we love going to New Hampshire I've been
 
01:21:30.390 --> 01:21:30.400 align:start position:0%
to New Hampshire it's a beautiful state
 
01:21:33.550 --> 01:21:33.560 align:start position:0%
it's a Serene State we really love your
 
01:21:36.390 --> 01:21:36.400 align:start position:0%
state and my response was well some of
 
01:21:39.030 --> 01:21:39.040 align:start position:0%
us are trying to keep it that way okay
 
01:21:43.070 --> 01:21:43.080 align:start position:0%
so I mean I would really be very uh Pro
 
01:21:46.110 --> 01:21:46.120 align:start position:0%
this bill as one step and the other
 
01:21:48.950 --> 01:21:48.960 align:start position:0%
thing is by maintaining private
 
01:21:51.910 --> 01:21:51.920 align:start position:0%
landfills we are inadvertently
 
01:21:55.629 --> 01:21:55.639 align:start position:0%
encouraging in trash okay because we're
 
01:21:57.550 --> 01:21:57.560 align:start position:0%
because there's money in it okay it's
 
01:22:00.390 --> 01:22:00.400 align:start position:0%
easy there's money in it you know and we
 
01:22:02.110 --> 01:22:02.120 align:start position:0%
are inadvertently
 
01:22:05.270 --> 01:22:05.280 align:start position:0%
encouraging uh people not to take the
 
01:22:08.629 --> 01:22:08.639 align:start position:0%
time to recycle reuse or
 
01:22:12.390 --> 01:22:12.400 align:start position:0%
refill so are you saying then that if
 
01:22:15.870 --> 01:22:15.880 align:start position:0%
the state owned the landfill that the
 
01:22:18.350 --> 01:22:18.360 align:start position:0%
state wouldn't be making that money no
 
01:22:21.030 --> 01:22:21.040 align:start position:0%
what I'm saying is is that if there's
 
01:22:22.870 --> 01:22:22.880 align:start position:0%
money to be made then we are
 
01:22:26.189 --> 01:22:26.199 align:start position:0%
inadvertently incentivizing Private
 
01:22:30.910 --> 01:22:30.920 align:start position:0%
Industry okay to open landfills um and
 
01:22:33.470 --> 01:22:33.480 align:start position:0%
sell the land I mean and you know people
 
01:22:36.430 --> 01:22:36.440 align:start position:0%
with a lot of land that want to get rid
 
01:22:38.990 --> 01:22:39.000 align:start position:0%
of it you know are incentivized then to
 
01:22:41.550 --> 01:22:41.560 align:start position:0%
sell it to these companies as long as
 
01:22:44.590 --> 01:22:44.600 align:start position:0%
they pass the de regulations nobody can
 
01:22:47.950 --> 01:22:47.960 align:start position:0%
do anything about it and what we need to
 
01:22:49.790 --> 01:22:49.800 align:start position:0%
be thinking about is just like
 
01:22:52.550 --> 01:22:52.560 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby has said it should
 
01:22:55.390 --> 01:22:55.400 align:start position:0%
should be need based just like they do
 
01:22:58.709 --> 01:22:58.719 align:start position:0%
with hospitals okay a private company
 
01:23:01.709 --> 01:23:01.719 align:start position:0%
can't come in and build a new hospital
 
01:23:04.189 --> 01:23:04.199 align:start position:0%
just because they bought a piece of land
 
01:23:06.830 --> 01:23:06.840 align:start position:0%
there has to be a needs assessment and
 
01:23:09.110 --> 01:23:09.120 align:start position:0%
and our land is you know we're not
 
01:23:10.910 --> 01:23:10.920 align:start position:0%
making any more of it it's very
 
01:23:14.030 --> 01:23:14.040 align:start position:0%
important and right now the there's
 
01:23:16.629 --> 01:23:16.639 align:start position:0%
nothing to prevent a company that thinks
 
01:23:19.070 --> 01:23:19.080 align:start position:0%
they can make money to buy a piece of
 
01:23:21.669 --> 01:23:21.679 align:start position:0%
property get it permitted and so we
 
01:23:23.030 --> 01:23:23.040 align:start position:0%
could have a flood
 
01:23:25.189 --> 01:23:25.199 align:start position:0%
of landfills which is exactly what we
 
01:23:25.199 --> 01:23:27.629 align:start position:0%
of landfills which is exactly what we
don't

01:23:27.629 --> 01:23:27.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:31.229 --> 01:23:31.239 align:start position:0%
want um represent Bixby go back on this
 
01:23:33.350 --> 01:23:33.360 align:start position:0%
i' like to point out one other aspect of
 
01:23:36.950 --> 01:23:36.960 align:start position:0%
this bill is that if the uh if the
 
01:23:40.030 --> 01:23:40.040 align:start position:0%
landfill were to be state-owned it would
 
01:23:42.550 --> 01:23:42.560 align:start position:0%
have to be managed by a private company
 
01:23:45.270 --> 01:23:45.280 align:start position:0%
which would then provide a business
 
01:23:49.510 --> 01:23:49.520 align:start position:0%
opportunity uh and so that and and it
 
01:23:50.830 --> 01:23:50.840 align:start position:0%
could provide it could be a fairly
 
01:23:53.550 --> 01:23:53.560 align:start position:0%
lucrative Pro you know
 
01:23:57.990 --> 01:23:58.000 align:start position:0%
uh business opportunity for the for a
 
01:24:01.510 --> 01:24:01.520 align:start position:0%
company that wanted to do the U
 
01:24:03.709 --> 01:24:03.719 align:start position:0%
construction and management of a
 
01:24:07.310 --> 01:24:07.320 align:start position:0%
landfill uh and uh they would still have
 
01:24:10.629 --> 01:24:10.639 align:start position:0%
to meet all of the regulations that we
 
01:24:13.470 --> 01:24:13.480 align:start position:0%
have for how landfills are constructed
 
01:24:18.310 --> 01:24:18.320 align:start position:0%
and run but uh but it means that uh that
 
01:24:20.830 --> 01:24:20.840 align:start position:0%
that the operation of the landfill is
 
01:24:23.270 --> 01:24:23.280 align:start position:0%
really where the money is in the in the
 
01:24:26.030 --> 01:24:26.040 align:start position:0%
business is not uh not so much that you
 
01:24:27.709 --> 01:24:27.719 align:start position:0%
necessarily own the land but Phill but
 
01:24:29.750 --> 01:24:29.760 align:start position:0%
you are getting the constant in Revenue
 
01:24:32.990 --> 01:24:33.000 align:start position:0%
stream from the
 
01:24:35.870 --> 01:24:35.880 align:start position:0%
operation um representative
 
01:24:38.430 --> 01:24:38.440 align:start position:0%
Penza yeah I I agree with what
 
01:24:41.350 --> 01:24:41.360 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby said in in several
 
01:24:43.550 --> 01:24:43.560 align:start position:0%
statements that representative um Duty
 
01:24:46.390 --> 01:24:46.400 align:start position:0%
said so this is we're talking about
 
01:24:49.790 --> 01:24:49.800 align:start position:0%
something that possibly will have one of
 
01:24:52.669 --> 01:24:52.679 align:start position:0%
one in the next hundred years and so
 
01:24:55.030 --> 01:24:55.040 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a public private partnership
 
01:24:56.470 --> 01:24:56.480 align:start position:0%
and in a sense it's like think of it
 
01:24:58.709 --> 01:24:58.719 align:start position:0%
like a public utility we're not talking
 
01:25:01.149 --> 01:25:01.159 align:start position:0%
about stifling a business or something
 
01:25:03.590 --> 01:25:03.600 align:start position:0%
like that and that's creating widgets
 
01:25:06.790 --> 01:25:06.800 align:start position:0%
we're talking about trash and um which
 
01:25:08.510 --> 01:25:08.520 align:start position:0%
has impacts on everything from the
 
01:25:10.229 --> 01:25:10.239 align:start position:0%
environment and all that kind of stuff
 
01:25:12.990 --> 01:25:13.000 align:start position:0%
the skin in the game is that the state
 
01:25:16.149 --> 01:25:16.159 align:start position:0%
owns the property but everything else
 
01:25:19.990 --> 01:25:20.000 align:start position:0%
99% of everything else is run on that
 
01:25:22.550 --> 01:25:22.560 align:start position:0%
from the experts that do it you know
 
01:25:24.750 --> 01:25:24.760 align:start position:0%
like a waste management or something
 
01:25:26.310 --> 01:25:26.320 align:start position:0%
that that runs it that has to fall
 
01:25:30.510 --> 01:25:30.520 align:start position:0%
through all of the same criteria I
 
01:25:33.550 --> 01:25:33.560 align:start position:0%
just representative Roch Rochester
 
01:25:36.030 --> 01:25:36.040 align:start position:0%
doesn't do it that way but um actually
 
01:25:38.390 --> 01:25:38.400 align:start position:0%
in in Maine I believe that the the
 
01:25:41.470 --> 01:25:41.480 align:start position:0%
landfill that um that cassella operates
 
01:25:43.590 --> 01:25:43.600 align:start position:0%
is that they are a public private
 
01:25:45.950 --> 01:25:45.960 align:start position:0%
partnership like that so meaning Maine
 
01:25:48.310 --> 01:25:48.320 align:start position:0%
owns the the the the land and then of
 
01:25:50.750 --> 01:25:50.760 align:start position:0%
course cassella operates it so just
 
01:25:53.950 --> 01:25:53.960 align:start position:0%
another example representative
 
01:25:56.870 --> 01:25:56.880 align:start position:0%
Katon I
 
01:25:59.950 --> 01:25:59.960 align:start position:0%
mean I guess first of all I'm not the
 
01:26:02.070 --> 01:26:02.080 align:start position:0%
public private partnership makes sense
 
01:26:05.229 --> 01:26:05.239 align:start position:0%
to me even though I'm not into the state
 
01:26:06.550 --> 01:26:06.560 align:start position:0%
owning and
 
01:26:09.149 --> 01:26:09.159 align:start position:0%
operating you know that that's just not
 
01:26:11.030 --> 01:26:11.040 align:start position:0%
what I believe should be
 
01:26:13.189 --> 01:26:13.199 align:start position:0%
happening but the one question I've got
 
01:26:14.870 --> 01:26:14.880 align:start position:0%
and I get push back against
 
01:26:16.870 --> 01:26:16.880 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby a little bit that I
 
01:26:19.430 --> 01:26:19.440 align:start position:0%
don't understand is that yeah they build
 
01:26:21.590 --> 01:26:21.600 align:start position:0%
it they operate it and today they build
 
01:26:23.910 --> 01:26:23.920 align:start position:0%
it and they operate they make a profit
 
01:26:27.430 --> 01:26:27.440 align:start position:0%
but if you take away out of state trash
 
01:26:29.270 --> 01:26:29.280 align:start position:0%
what does that do to the profit margin
 
01:26:31.990 --> 01:26:32.000 align:start position:0%
and is it still profitable because as I
 
01:26:33.629 --> 01:26:33.639 align:start position:0%
understand it the amount of trash we
 
01:26:37.229 --> 01:26:37.239 align:start position:0%
bring in 48% I think is what we heard a
 
01:26:39.629 --> 01:26:39.639 align:start position:0%
couple weeks ago is a substantial amount
 
01:26:42.950 --> 01:26:42.960 align:start position:0%
of the money that they make and so then
 
01:26:45.550 --> 01:26:45.560 align:start position:0%
is it is it still profitable I don't
 
01:26:47.870 --> 01:26:47.880 align:start position:0%
know the answer to
 
01:26:51.550 --> 01:26:51.560 align:start position:0%
that represent VI Fe so um given the
 
01:26:54.310 --> 01:26:54.320 align:start position:0%
volume of trash that we produce in New
 
01:26:58.070 --> 01:26:58.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh the so there's actually two
 
01:27:00.790 --> 01:27:00.800 align:start position:0%
levels to this one is that if there's
 
01:27:03.990 --> 01:27:04.000 align:start position:0%
not a need for it then there there would
 
01:27:05.910 --> 01:27:05.920 align:start position:0%
be no incentive for the state to set up
 
01:27:09.990 --> 01:27:10.000 align:start position:0%
a landfill if there's a need for it then
 
01:27:11.669 --> 01:27:11.679 align:start position:0%
that the fact that there's a need for it
 
01:27:13.709 --> 01:27:13.719 align:start position:0%
means that there is going to be enough
 
01:27:16.430 --> 01:27:16.440 align:start position:0%
trash to provide a revenue stream uh the
 
01:27:20.189 --> 01:27:20.199 align:start position:0%
other aspect of this is that uh if you
 
01:27:21.709 --> 01:27:21.719 align:start position:0%
if we look at Waste Management in
 
01:27:21.719 --> 01:27:23.149 align:start position:0%
if we look at Waste Management in
Rochester

01:27:23.149 --> 01:27:23.159 align:start position:0%
Rochester
 
01:27:26.510 --> 01:27:26.520 align:start position:0%
uh they they do landfilling but they
 
01:27:29.510 --> 01:27:29.520 align:start position:0%
also have a very extensive recycling
 
01:27:34.750 --> 01:27:34.760 align:start position:0%
operation as well and a so uh one of the
 
01:27:37.990 --> 01:27:38.000 align:start position:0%
things that some that a if if we did
 
01:27:40.790 --> 01:27:40.800 align:start position:0%
have a uh state-owned landfill that was
 
01:27:43.229 --> 01:27:43.239 align:start position:0%
operated by a private company that
 
01:27:45.270 --> 01:27:45.280 align:start position:0%
private company could establish multiple
 
01:27:48.470 --> 01:27:48.480 align:start position:0%
revenue streams by doing things with the
 
01:27:52.550 --> 01:27:52.560 align:start position:0%
trash that was not landfilling it it and
 
01:27:57.310 --> 01:27:57.320 align:start position:0%
uh so uh having having a sort of a comp
 
01:28:00.270 --> 01:28:00.280 align:start position:0%
having a a public landfill that was part
 
01:28:03.270 --> 01:28:03.280 align:start position:0%
of a comprehensive waste management
 
01:28:06.470 --> 01:28:06.480 align:start position:0%
system uh would be uh would be a real
 
01:28:08.950 --> 01:28:08.960 align:start position:0%
benefit for the
 
01:28:11.910 --> 01:28:11.920 align:start position:0%
state representative
 
01:28:14.310 --> 01:28:14.320 align:start position:0%
K thank you madam
 
01:28:17.910 --> 01:28:17.920 align:start position:0%
chair I understand the reasoning behind
 
01:28:17.920 --> 01:28:19.910 align:start position:0%
chair I understand the reasoning behind
the

01:28:19.910 --> 01:28:19.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:28:22.550 --> 01:28:22.560 align:start position:0%
bill but we can't compare
 
01:28:24.310 --> 01:28:24.320 align:start position:0%
Public Utilities with this because
 
01:28:29.430 --> 01:28:29.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:32.310 --> 01:28:32.320 align:start position:0%
state-owned I like the idea of A needs
 
01:28:34.950 --> 01:28:34.960 align:start position:0%
assessment uh regarding landfills I
 
01:28:36.870 --> 01:28:36.880 align:start position:0%
think uh we should look at the need of
 
01:28:36.880 --> 01:28:39.390 align:start position:0%
think uh we should look at the need of
the

01:28:39.390 --> 01:28:39.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:39.400 --> 01:28:42.189 align:start position:0%
 
state

01:28:42.189 --> 01:28:42.199 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:28:45.270 --> 01:28:45.280 align:start position:0%
however I re am really concerned about
 
01:28:48.070 --> 01:28:48.080 align:start position:0%
the state owning the landfill I
 
01:28:50.790 --> 01:28:50.800 align:start position:0%
understand the interstate commerce
 
01:28:53.149 --> 01:28:53.159 align:start position:0%
laws but but if we are going to get
 
01:28:56.350 --> 01:28:56.360 align:start position:0%
better at recycling and everything
 
01:29:01.470 --> 01:29:01.480 align:start position:0%
else then and we want to encourage
 
01:29:04.390 --> 01:29:04.400 align:start position:0%
that and as representative Bix me
 
01:29:06.629 --> 01:29:06.639 align:start position:0%
mentioned waste management is you know
 
01:29:08.550 --> 01:29:08.560 align:start position:0%
really getting into the recycling aspect
 
01:29:08.560 --> 01:29:10.350 align:start position:0%
really getting into the recycling aspect
of

01:29:10.350 --> 01:29:10.360 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:29:12.550 --> 01:29:12.560 align:start position:0%
things then that would actually limit
 
01:29:14.830 --> 01:29:14.840 align:start position:0%
the amount of waste going into a
 
01:29:17.109 --> 01:29:17.119 align:start position:0%
landfill and we also have to remember
 
01:29:20.910 --> 01:29:20.920 align:start position:0%
that we send our hazardous waste out of
 
01:29:20.920 --> 01:29:23.189 align:start position:0%
that we send our hazardous waste out of
state

01:29:23.189 --> 01:29:23.199 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:29:27.149 --> 01:29:27.159 align:start position:0%
what if all of a sudden where we send
 
01:29:28.990 --> 01:29:29.000 align:start position:0%
our hazardous waste decides to do a
 
01:29:31.750 --> 01:29:31.760 align:start position:0%
state-owned landfill and no longer take
 
01:29:35.629 --> 01:29:35.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:38.030 --> 01:29:38.040 align:start position:0%
waste and do exactly what we're trying
 
01:29:40.590 --> 01:29:40.600 align:start position:0%
to do what are we going to do with our
 
01:29:43.030 --> 01:29:43.040 align:start position:0%
hazardous waste
 
01:29:46.550 --> 01:29:46.560 align:start position:0%
then I think we need to be very
 
01:29:50.590 --> 01:29:50.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:53.910 --> 01:29:53.920 align:start position:0%
this because
 
01:29:58.550 --> 01:29:58.560 align:start position:0%
because it's it's a really important
 
01:30:01.870 --> 01:30:01.880 align:start position:0%
topic and we need to be cognizant of our
 
01:30:06.590 --> 01:30:06.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:10.870 --> 01:30:10.880 align:start position:0%
tourism but having the state own it
 
01:30:14.430 --> 01:30:14.440 align:start position:0%
isn't going to get rid of landfills
 
01:30:15.910 --> 01:30:15.920 align:start position:0%
we're still going to have a landfill
 
01:30:18.950 --> 01:30:18.960 align:start position:0%
whether it's privately owned or publicly
 
01:30:21.550 --> 01:30:21.560 align:start position:0%
owned we still need trash are going to
 
01:30:21.560 --> 01:30:22.430 align:start position:0%
owned we still need trash are going to
have

01:30:22.430 --> 01:30:22.440 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:30:24.910 --> 01:30:24.920 align:start position:0%
crash if they're going to do recycling
 
01:30:27.149 --> 01:30:27.159 align:start position:0%
they're going to need to have more
 
01:30:32.950 --> 01:30:32.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:35.870 --> 01:30:35.880 align:start position:0%
profitable so if we want to look at
 
01:30:38.030 --> 01:30:38.040 align:start position:0%
something based on needs assessment I
 
01:30:39.590 --> 01:30:39.600 align:start position:0%
think that's a great
 
01:30:44.590 --> 01:30:44.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:47.750 --> 01:30:47.760 align:start position:0%
cautious represent Howard thank you
 
01:30:50.870 --> 01:30:50.880 align:start position:0%
madam chair so um I guess that my first
 
01:30:52.669 --> 01:30:52.679 align:start position:0%
question is sort of answered
 
01:30:54.310 --> 01:30:54.320 align:start position:0%
I think it's still possible to make a
 
01:30:56.870 --> 01:30:56.880 align:start position:0%
profit managing a a landfill and so we
 
01:30:58.910 --> 01:30:58.920 align:start position:0%
we would be able to invite people to to
 
01:31:01.149 --> 01:31:01.159 align:start position:0%
partake in that I really believe that
 
01:31:03.350 --> 01:31:03.360 align:start position:0%
the um that the management should be
 
01:31:05.229 --> 01:31:05.239 align:start position:0%
close to the source of the regulation or
 
01:31:06.830 --> 01:31:06.840 align:start position:0%
the or the ownership should be close to
 
01:31:08.910 --> 01:31:08.920 align:start position:0%
the regul the source of the regulation
 
01:31:10.390 --> 01:31:10.400 align:start position:0%
so this would be the advantage of having
 
01:31:12.550 --> 01:31:12.560 align:start position:0%
the state own it when we all know that
 
01:31:14.189 --> 01:31:14.199 align:start position:0%
that they have not been able to stop the
 
01:31:15.910 --> 01:31:15.920 align:start position:0%
leech it from any of the landfills that
 
01:31:19.430 --> 01:31:19.440 align:start position:0%
we that have been in New Hampshire and
 
01:31:21.390 --> 01:31:21.400 align:start position:0%
um so many brownfields get deserted by
 
01:31:23.390 --> 01:31:23.400 align:start position:0%
the owner ERS just they just walk away
 
01:31:25.350 --> 01:31:25.360 align:start position:0%
from them I think that if the state owns
 
01:31:26.870 --> 01:31:26.880 align:start position:0%
it it would we would have a better
 
01:31:28.990 --> 01:31:29.000 align:start position:0%
chance of of better management of the
 
01:31:31.669 --> 01:31:31.679 align:start position:0%
leech a and also better cleanup
 
01:31:35.030 --> 01:31:35.040 align:start position:0%
afterwards represent dsy thank you madam
 
01:31:37.070 --> 01:31:37.080 align:start position:0%
chair I just want to make two points
 
01:31:40.070 --> 01:31:40.080 align:start position:0%
first of all our responsibility is to
 
01:31:42.910 --> 01:31:42.920 align:start position:0%
the people of New Hampshire uh we do not
 
01:31:45.189 --> 01:31:45.199 align:start position:0%
have a responsibility to make sure that
 
01:31:47.550 --> 01:31:47.560 align:start position:0%
Private Industry makes a profit that's
 
01:31:49.790 --> 01:31:49.800 align:start position:0%
their job okay and if they can't make a
 
01:31:50.910 --> 01:31:50.920 align:start position:0%
profit then they're going to do
 
01:31:52.910 --> 01:31:52.920 align:start position:0%
something else and and then we do
 
01:31:54.510 --> 01:31:54.520 align:start position:0%
something else so that's the chess game
 
01:31:56.790 --> 01:31:56.800 align:start position:0%
of life that's what you do the second
 
01:31:59.470 --> 01:31:59.480 align:start position:0%
thing is is that by having it state
 
01:32:03.390 --> 01:32:03.400 align:start position:0%
owned we control capacity and I think
 
01:32:05.629 --> 01:32:05.639 align:start position:0%
that that's what I was trying to say
 
01:32:09.750 --> 01:32:09.760 align:start position:0%
before and that is what is critical um
 
01:32:12.510 --> 01:32:12.520 align:start position:0%
because if you again if you allow it to
 
01:32:14.830 --> 01:32:14.840 align:start position:0%
priv Private Industry and there's a
 
01:32:17.390 --> 01:32:17.400 align:start position:0%
profit to be made then there can be
 
01:32:20.270 --> 01:32:20.280 align:start position:0%
overc capacity and we have you know I
 
01:32:22.229 --> 01:32:22.239 align:start position:0%
mean just look at the retail space
 
01:32:24.830 --> 01:32:24.840 align:start position:0%
I mean we are so wasteful in this
 
01:32:27.590 --> 01:32:27.600 align:start position:0%
country in that we get on a fad
 
01:32:30.510 --> 01:32:30.520 align:start position:0%
everybody builds buildings uh you know
 
01:32:32.189 --> 01:32:32.199 align:start position:0%
and then all of a sudden there's nobody
 
01:32:35.070 --> 01:32:35.080 align:start position:0%
there to occupy the buildings uh so now
 
01:32:37.470 --> 01:32:37.480 align:start position:0%
there's retail space that's empty we
 
01:32:41.550 --> 01:32:41.560 align:start position:0%
chewed up land we have um you know uh
 
01:32:44.390 --> 01:32:44.400 align:start position:0%
more impervious surfaces that we have to
 
01:32:46.270 --> 01:32:46.280 align:start position:0%
deal with you have the same thing in
 
01:32:48.669 --> 01:32:48.679 align:start position:0%
Office Buildings right now do we really
 
01:32:49.990 --> 01:32:50.000 align:start position:0%
want that in
 
01:32:52.590 --> 01:32:52.600 align:start position:0%
landfills representative DAV
 
01:32:55.910 --> 01:32:55.920 align:start position:0%
this thank you madam chair my my
 
01:32:58.430 --> 01:32:58.440 align:start position:0%
question is with a landfill that's state
 
01:33:00.750 --> 01:33:00.760 align:start position:0%
owned and privately run where would
 
01:33:03.310 --> 01:33:03.320 align:start position:0%
liability lie in case of an incident
 
01:33:05.590 --> 01:33:05.600 align:start position:0%
would the state be on the hook for like
 
01:33:06.990 --> 01:33:07.000 align:start position:0%
I not that I'm in agreement with this
 
01:33:09.910 --> 01:33:09.920 align:start position:0%
but I I've heard it said a lot of times
 
01:33:12.629 --> 01:33:12.639 align:start position:0%
not if it leaks but when it leaks will
 
01:33:16.310 --> 01:33:16.320 align:start position:0%
the state be responsible for that of of
 
01:33:17.189 --> 01:33:17.199 align:start position:0%
course it
 
01:33:22.709 --> 01:33:22.719 align:start position:0%
would yeah represent Bixby so um
 
01:33:25.590 --> 01:33:25.600 align:start position:0%
so one of the things that uh is not in
 
01:33:28.189 --> 01:33:28.199 align:start position:0%
this bill because um there is not an
 
01:33:30.470 --> 01:33:30.480 align:start position:0%
actual plan for a state land state-owned
 
01:33:34.470 --> 01:33:34.480 align:start position:0%
landfill right now is uh the details of
 
01:33:38.310 --> 01:33:38.320 align:start position:0%
how the state would have to
 
01:33:40.590 --> 01:33:40.600 align:start position:0%
um how how the state would do the
 
01:33:43.390 --> 01:33:43.400 align:start position:0%
acquisition of the land or the assign or
 
01:33:45.910 --> 01:33:45.920 align:start position:0%
the assessment assignment of the land
 
01:33:48.590 --> 01:33:48.600 align:start position:0%
and how the St State most importantly
 
01:33:50.750 --> 01:33:50.760 align:start position:0%
how the state would set up the contract
 
01:33:53.470 --> 01:33:53.480 align:start position:0%
with the management the waste
 
01:33:56.270 --> 01:33:56.280 align:start position:0%
corporation that was hired to manage it
 
01:33:58.709 --> 01:33:58.719 align:start position:0%
there would be an RFP and there would be
 
01:34:02.149 --> 01:34:02.159 align:start position:0%
a contract with that management
 
01:34:05.830 --> 01:34:05.840 align:start position:0%
organization and the liability would be
 
01:34:07.270 --> 01:34:07.280 align:start position:0%
something that would be spelled out in
 
01:34:07.280 --> 01:34:09.270 align:start position:0%
something that would be spelled out in
that

01:34:09.270 --> 01:34:09.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:34:12.590 --> 01:34:12.600 align:start position:0%
contract okay representative kto thank
 
01:34:14.030 --> 01:34:14.040 align:start position:0%
you madam
 
01:34:16.590 --> 01:34:16.600 align:start position:0%
chair there is nothing right now
 
01:34:19.149 --> 01:34:19.159 align:start position:0%
prohibiting municipalities or
 
01:34:23.189 --> 01:34:23.199 align:start position:0%
regions from doing a PP part
 
01:34:25.910 --> 01:34:25.920 align:start position:0%
parnership as we said four out of the
 
01:34:25.920 --> 01:34:28.709 align:start position:0%
parnership as we said four out of the
six

01:34:28.709 --> 01:34:28.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:32.149 --> 01:34:32.159 align:start position:0%
landfills are publicly
 
01:34:34.830 --> 01:34:34.840 align:start position:0%
owned and maybe if there was another
 
01:34:37.470 --> 01:34:37.480 align:start position:0%
landfill it could try the pp partnership
 
01:34:40.189 --> 01:34:40.199 align:start position:0%
thing with the municipality not
 
01:34:41.790 --> 01:34:41.800 align:start position:0%
necessarily the state or the region
 
01:34:43.470 --> 01:34:43.480 align:start position:0%
where they want to put it there's
 
01:34:45.350 --> 01:34:45.360 align:start position:0%
nothing prohibiting that from happening
 
01:34:49.109 --> 01:34:49.119 align:start position:0%
right now municipalities and regions
 
01:34:52.430 --> 01:34:52.440 align:start position:0%
have the ability to do this why are we
 
01:34:54.709 --> 01:34:54.719 align:start position:0%
putting it in statute because if you if
 
01:34:57.910 --> 01:34:57.920 align:start position:0%
your region wants to have a landfill so
 
01:35:00.070 --> 01:35:00.080 align:start position:0%
that they can limit what comes in for
 
01:35:04.310 --> 01:35:04.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:08.310 --> 01:35:08.320 align:start position:0%
it um I want to also uh dovetail and I
 
01:35:10.950 --> 01:35:10.960 align:start position:0%
mean we can talk about hb1
 
01:35:13.990 --> 01:35:14.000 align:start position:0%
1632 as in this entire discussion as
 
01:35:16.750 --> 01:35:16.760 align:start position:0%
well and that bill just merely um it
 
01:35:18.390 --> 01:35:18.400 align:start position:0%
doesn't ban private ownership of
 
01:35:21.830 --> 01:35:21.840 align:start position:0%
landfills but it allows um privately
 
01:35:25.229 --> 01:35:25.239 align:start position:0%
owned landfills to put a 15% cap on out
 
01:35:25.239 --> 01:35:26.270 align:start position:0%
owned landfills to put a 15% cap on out
ofate

01:35:26.270 --> 01:35:26.280 align:start position:0%
ofate
 
01:35:29.669 --> 01:35:29.679 align:start position:0%
trash and um I mean for me I think that
 
01:35:32.790 --> 01:35:32.800 align:start position:0%
that's a more
 
01:35:36.430 --> 01:35:36.440 align:start position:0%
reasonable um compromise on this
 
01:35:39.709 --> 01:35:39.719 align:start position:0%
because you're still uh allowing the
 
01:35:43.229 --> 01:35:43.239 align:start position:0%
ability of uh limiting the amount of out
 
01:35:46.910 --> 01:35:46.920 align:start position:0%
ofate trash within the confines of the
 
01:35:49.950 --> 01:35:49.960 align:start position:0%
Commerce Clause and then you know you're
 
01:35:53.629 --> 01:35:53.639 align:start position:0%
not um you're not Banning private
 
01:35:57.709 --> 01:35:57.719 align:start position:0%
private ownership um so what what are
 
01:35:59.629 --> 01:35:59.639 align:start position:0%
your thoughts on that representative H
 
01:36:02.149 --> 01:36:02.159 align:start position:0%
Haskins thank you madam chair I just
 
01:36:06.070 --> 01:36:06.080 align:start position:0%
wanted to go back for a moment um
 
01:36:11.550 --> 01:36:11.560 align:start position:0%
again the RFP suggests that if there's a
 
01:36:15.350 --> 01:36:15.360 align:start position:0%
profit to be made the company can make
 
01:36:18.229 --> 01:36:18.239 align:start position:0%
you know the offer and this is a billion
 
01:36:21.350 --> 01:36:21.360 align:start position:0%
doll industry so we really don't have to
 
01:36:23.830 --> 01:36:23.840 align:start position:0%
worry in my view about their ability to
 
01:36:26.950 --> 01:36:26.960 align:start position:0%
make a profit state-owned or otherwise
 
01:36:32.350 --> 01:36:32.360 align:start position:0%
um so secondly again local control very
 
01:36:34.590 --> 01:36:34.600 align:start position:0%
important to a lot of people in the
 
01:36:38.990 --> 01:36:39.000 align:start position:0%
legislature and this would give us um
 
01:36:43.950 --> 01:36:43.960 align:start position:0%
more of that and as rep Davis said
 
01:36:47.910 --> 01:36:47.920 align:start position:0%
um leni's leak and we just heard
 
01:36:50.590 --> 01:36:50.600 align:start position:0%
testimony in the subcommittee about
 
01:36:53.709 --> 01:36:53.719 align:start position:0%
double line ERS and all the length at
 
01:36:56.229 --> 01:36:56.239 align:start position:0%
which companies go to ensure that it
 
01:37:00.430 --> 01:37:00.440 align:start position:0%
doesn't happen but it does and so I
 
01:37:03.790 --> 01:37:03.800 align:start position:0%
think having the state uh owning the
 
01:37:07.550 --> 01:37:07.560 align:start position:0%
land gives us agency that we lack right
 
01:37:09.950 --> 01:37:09.960 align:start position:0%
now and I say again there's a reason why
 
01:37:11.750 --> 01:37:11.760 align:start position:0%
they haven't done it why the state
 
01:37:14.149 --> 01:37:14.159 align:start position:0%
hasn't done it it is very hard to
 
01:37:17.030 --> 01:37:17.040 align:start position:0%
compete with a billion dollar industry
 
01:37:20.270 --> 01:37:20.280 align:start position:0%
and all the lobbyists that they have so
 
01:37:22.950 --> 01:37:22.960 align:start position:0%
um I'm very supportive of this bill and
 
01:37:27.109 --> 01:37:27.119 align:start position:0%
when it comes to the next one um I I
 
01:37:30.070 --> 01:37:30.080 align:start position:0%
don't want New Hampshire to be known for
 
01:37:33.149 --> 01:37:33.159 align:start position:0%
trash we've got to look forward in this
 
01:37:36.030 --> 01:37:36.040 align:start position:0%
topic we're not you know we have
 
01:37:39.270 --> 01:37:39.280 align:start position:0%
capacity right now and don't need more
 
01:37:43.750 --> 01:37:43.760 align:start position:0%
until 34 or 35 so I want us to look down
 
01:37:47.750 --> 01:37:47.760 align:start position:0%
the road um at what we can do to enhance
 
01:37:50.950 --> 01:37:50.960 align:start position:0%
the the methodology for recycling and
 
01:37:53.189 --> 01:37:53.199 align:start position:0%
for food waste and all the rest of it
 
01:37:53.199 --> 01:37:54.390 align:start position:0%
for food waste and all the rest of it
and

01:37:54.390 --> 01:37:54.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:37:58.750 --> 01:37:58.760 align:start position:0%
not open ourselves up to um an industry
 
01:38:00.310 --> 01:38:00.320 align:start position:0%
that wants to make a lot of money and
 
01:38:01.870 --> 01:38:01.880 align:start position:0%
take our natural
 
01:38:05.229 --> 01:38:05.239 align:start position:0%
resources representative ktoa and then
 
01:38:08.310 --> 01:38:08.320 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um just a question
 
01:38:11.109 --> 01:38:11.119 align:start position:0%
on something that you said um regarding
 
01:38:11.119 --> 01:38:12.709 align:start position:0%
on something that you said um regarding
HB

01:38:12.709 --> 01:38:12.719 align:start position:0%
HB
 
01:38:16.830 --> 01:38:16.840 align:start position:0%
1632 um you said that it would allow
 
01:38:18.669 --> 01:38:18.679 align:start position:0%
privately owned landfills to put a cap
 
01:38:21.870 --> 01:38:21.880 align:start position:0%
on but doesn't the bill state that they
 
01:38:25.270 --> 01:38:25.280 align:start position:0%
might that the cap would be
 
01:38:29.709 --> 01:38:29.719 align:start position:0%
15% um it's not that they could do that
 
01:38:31.589 --> 01:38:31.599 align:start position:0%
it's that they must do
 
01:38:35.910 --> 01:38:35.920 align:start position:0%
that um so just wanted to clarify
 
01:38:39.830 --> 01:38:39.840 align:start position:0%
that represent Penza my gosh I've got a
 
01:38:41.950 --> 01:38:41.960 align:start position:0%
bunch of questions now um
 
01:38:45.310 --> 01:38:45.320 align:start position:0%
so first I wanted to say this goes back
 
01:38:47.430 --> 01:38:47.440 align:start position:0%
on a statement I'm not sure who made it
 
01:38:49.470 --> 01:38:49.480 align:start position:0%
but you know we talk about we and all
 
01:38:51.830 --> 01:38:51.840 align:start position:0%
that kind of stuff in regards with with
 
01:38:53.990 --> 01:38:54.000 align:start position:0%
the private companies but these private
 
01:38:56.270 --> 01:38:56.280 align:start position:0%
companies one of course is in Vermont
 
01:38:59.390 --> 01:38:59.400 align:start position:0%
and the other one is in is in Texas I
 
01:39:01.270 --> 01:39:01.280 align:start position:0%
mean we're not talking about New
 
01:39:03.550 --> 01:39:03.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire based businesses you know that
 
01:39:07.070 --> 01:39:07.080 align:start position:0%
are operating in this private private
 
01:39:09.149 --> 01:39:09.159 align:start position:0%
landfill so I want that to be clear like
 
01:39:10.870 --> 01:39:10.880 align:start position:0%
we're you know we're not necessarily
 
01:39:13.229 --> 01:39:13.239 align:start position:0%
enriching um you know New Hampshire
 
01:39:15.790 --> 01:39:15.800 align:start position:0%
business but here nor there and then the
 
01:39:18.030 --> 01:39:18.040 align:start position:0%
other piece in regards with
 
01:39:21.310 --> 01:39:21.320 align:start position:0%
1632 um thank you for clarifying so if
 
01:39:23.390 --> 01:39:23.400 align:start position:0%
we're going to put that you know that
 
01:39:27.109 --> 01:39:27.119 align:start position:0%
hard stop on it then you know maybe you
 
01:39:30.550 --> 01:39:30.560 align:start position:0%
know maybe 11:40 five isn't necessary
 
01:39:33.430 --> 01:39:33.440 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure but
 
01:39:36.830 --> 01:39:36.840 align:start position:0%
um I I still think if you look at where
 
01:39:38.709 --> 01:39:38.719 align:start position:0%
we're at right now the the current
 
01:39:41.030 --> 01:39:41.040 align:start position:0%
situation that we're at
 
01:39:43.870 --> 01:39:43.880 align:start position:0%
there the state is already on the hook
 
01:39:48.270 --> 01:39:48.280 align:start position:0%
for for every problem that happens so
 
01:39:50.589 --> 01:39:50.599 align:start position:0%
there are no I put a bill in and it's
 
01:39:52.189 --> 01:39:52.199 align:start position:0%
not going to go through I'll try it
 
01:39:54.990 --> 01:39:55.000 align:start position:0%
again but shity bonds if if you're going
 
01:39:56.589 --> 01:39:56.599 align:start position:0%
to come into the if you're going to come
 
01:39:58.390 --> 01:39:58.400 align:start position:0%
into the state and you're going to have
 
01:40:01.109 --> 01:40:01.119 align:start position:0%
landfill or something a great example
 
01:40:02.589 --> 01:40:02.599 align:start position:0%
let's just talk about you know the
 
01:40:05.070 --> 01:40:05.080 align:start position:0%
elephant in the room of St gobain they
 
01:40:08.390 --> 01:40:08.400 align:start position:0%
are now out they're cut and run and most
 
01:40:09.790 --> 01:40:09.800 align:start position:0%
of these companies as you know they
 
01:40:12.310 --> 01:40:12.320 align:start position:0%
claim bankruptcy they found a new LLC
 
01:40:14.990 --> 01:40:15.000 align:start position:0%
and then we're on the hook for it I I'm
 
01:40:16.990 --> 01:40:17.000 align:start position:0%
working on a report right now that shows
 
01:40:20.149 --> 01:40:20.159 align:start position:0%
this of New Hampshire and the super fund
 
01:40:22.589 --> 01:40:22.599 align:start position:0%
sites so I mean we have to look at that
 
01:40:24.589 --> 01:40:24.599 align:start position:0%
we're all paying for that whether it's
 
01:40:28.070 --> 01:40:28.080 align:start position:0%
federal or not that's all our money so
 
01:40:30.430 --> 01:40:30.440 align:start position:0%
we really have to start look shity bonds
 
01:40:32.030 --> 01:40:32.040 align:start position:0%
are a a constant thing if you're going
 
01:40:33.750 --> 01:40:33.760 align:start position:0%
to come here and we know that all
 
01:40:37.470 --> 01:40:37.480 align:start position:0%
landfills leak at some point then um it
 
01:40:39.709 --> 01:40:39.719 align:start position:0%
having that insurance policy whether
 
01:40:41.950 --> 01:40:41.960 align:start position:0%
it's state whether it's private whatever
 
01:40:43.910 --> 01:40:43.920 align:start position:0%
to protect us in the fer to protect the
 
01:40:46.270 --> 01:40:46.280 align:start position:0%
taxpayers that's what we should be doing
 
01:40:49.709 --> 01:40:49.719 align:start position:0%
most almost all other states have that
 
01:40:51.030 --> 01:40:51.040 align:start position:0%
if you're going to be doing something
 
01:40:53.149 --> 01:40:53.159 align:start position:0%
that's potentially going to be hazardous
 
01:40:54.830 --> 01:40:54.840 align:start position:0%
in the future that could wipe out
 
01:40:57.189 --> 01:40:57.199 align:start position:0%
drinking water for an entire region I
 
01:41:00.709 --> 01:41:00.719 align:start position:0%
mean yeah that's it's big deal so just
 
01:41:02.229 --> 01:41:02.239 align:start position:0%
my two
 
01:41:06.310 --> 01:41:06.320 align:start position:0%
cents representative Bixby yeah so um I
 
01:41:10.790 --> 01:41:10.800 align:start position:0%
don't I don't see uh the 1145 and and
 
01:41:14.790 --> 01:41:14.800 align:start position:0%
1632 as being an either War I think that
 
01:41:18.629 --> 01:41:18.639 align:start position:0%
um I I think it's a both end and uh so
 
01:41:23.430 --> 01:41:23.440 align:start position:0%
in terms of um in terms of 1632 uh I
 
01:41:26.390 --> 01:41:26.400 align:start position:0%
think that it does make sense to uh put
 
01:41:31.910 --> 01:41:31.920 align:start position:0%
a 15% cap on the on outof state waste um
 
01:41:36.310 --> 01:41:36.320 align:start position:0%
and I think that uh one of but one of
 
01:41:39.470 --> 01:41:39.480 align:start position:0%
the things that um I'm a little bit
 
01:41:41.669 --> 01:41:41.679 align:start position:0%
worried about with this bill is you know
 
01:41:44.629 --> 01:41:44.639 align:start position:0%
what happen how will it Faire in court
 
01:41:49.629 --> 01:41:49.639 align:start position:0%
um I think that uh we in terms of um in
 
01:41:53.470 --> 01:41:53.480 align:start position:0%
terms of the the solidness of the legal
 
01:41:57.189 --> 01:41:57.199 align:start position:0%
aspect of it I think that um 1145 is is
 
01:42:00.750 --> 01:42:00.760 align:start position:0%
a bit stronger but in terms of uh the
 
01:42:04.589 --> 01:42:04.599 align:start position:0%
you know how quickly it could be uh
 
01:42:08.270 --> 01:42:08.280 align:start position:0%
effective I think that that uh that um
 
01:42:12.070 --> 01:42:12.080 align:start position:0%
1632 might be uh more effective in the
 
01:42:15.790 --> 01:42:15.800 align:start position:0%
short run representative Davis thank you
 
01:42:18.870 --> 01:42:18.880 align:start position:0%
madam chair if the intent of of House
 
01:42:18.880 --> 01:42:19.750 align:start position:0%
madam chair if the intent of of House
Bill

01:42:19.750 --> 01:42:19.760 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
01:42:22.390 --> 01:42:22.400 align:start position:0%
1145 is to limit out
 
01:42:26.750 --> 01:42:26.760 align:start position:0%
ofate uh trash coming here what why
 
01:42:30.750 --> 01:42:30.760 align:start position:0%
wouldn't that take the place of uh 1632
 
01:42:32.750 --> 01:42:32.760 align:start position:0%
I mean we're looking to limit the amount
 
01:42:35.189 --> 01:42:35.199 align:start position:0%
of trash that would do it so why why
 
01:42:36.750 --> 01:42:36.760 align:start position:0%
would we need
 
01:42:42.030 --> 01:42:42.040 align:start position:0%
to represent kto thank you madam chair
 
01:42:45.310 --> 01:42:45.320 align:start position:0%
um we just put a moratorium on landfills
 
01:42:47.350 --> 01:42:47.360 align:start position:0%
we just passed a bill that no landfill
 
01:42:49.750 --> 01:42:49.760 align:start position:0%
could be cited until
 
01:42:49.760 --> 01:42:52.750 align:start position:0%
could be cited until
2028

01:42:52.750 --> 01:42:52.760 align:start position:0%
2028
 
01:42:55.350 --> 01:42:55.360 align:start position:0%
well it passed the house but this body
 
01:42:57.750 --> 01:42:57.760 align:start position:0%
passed this committee passed that and it
 
01:43:00.669 --> 01:43:00.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:02.950 --> 01:43:02.960 align:start position:0%
house it hasn't been on consent yet I
 
01:43:04.750 --> 01:43:04.760 align:start position:0%
don't think oh it has not passed the
 
01:43:08.709 --> 01:43:08.719 align:start position:0%
house yet okay I apologize but I believe
 
01:43:10.550 --> 01:43:10.560 align:start position:0%
that it's on it's on the consent it's on
 
01:43:12.550 --> 01:43:12.560 align:start position:0%
the consent calendar and I do believe
 
01:43:13.910 --> 01:43:13.920 align:start position:0%
that it will be the will of the body to
 
01:43:15.830 --> 01:43:15.840 align:start position:0%
put a moratorium on
 
01:43:17.669 --> 01:43:17.679 align:start position:0%
landfills I
 
01:43:20.390 --> 01:43:20.400 align:start position:0%
think um I just want everyone to
 
01:43:25.550 --> 01:43:25.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:33.109 --> 01:43:33.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:36.070 --> 01:43:36.080 align:start position:0%
there let me just double
 
01:43:43.189 --> 01:43:43.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:45.950 --> 01:43:45.960 align:start position:0%
consent yes it is it is on the consent
 
01:43:47.589 --> 01:43:47.599 align:start position:0%
calendar for
 
01:43:50.229 --> 01:43:50.239 align:start position:0%
tomorrow it off just going to throw that
 
01:43:51.709 --> 01:43:51.719 align:start position:0%
out so
 
01:43:54.950 --> 01:43:54.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:57.350 --> 01:43:57.360 align:start position:0%
no representative Howard and then H
 
01:44:00.149 --> 01:44:00.159 align:start position:0%
Haskins thank you mam ch um I I just
 
01:44:02.030 --> 01:44:02.040 align:start position:0%
really want to emphasize what I said and
 
01:44:04.550 --> 01:44:04.560 align:start position:0%
what representative Penza also
 
01:44:07.830 --> 01:44:07.840 align:start position:0%
vehemently said Private Industry walks
 
01:44:10.830 --> 01:44:10.840 align:start position:0%
away from brownfields um so I think that
 
01:44:12.950 --> 01:44:12.960 align:start position:0%
if we're if we are going to have
 
01:44:15.149 --> 01:44:15.159 align:start position:0%
landfills in the future we need to have
 
01:44:18.790 --> 01:44:18.800 align:start position:0%
it the the owners of the landfills be
 
01:44:21.229 --> 01:44:21.239 align:start position:0%
the ultimate responsibility
 
01:44:24.070 --> 01:44:24.080 align:start position:0%
responsible entity I think that we you
 
01:44:26.790 --> 01:44:26.800 align:start position:0%
know they it's just too risky to put
 
01:44:28.390 --> 01:44:28.400 align:start position:0%
that much poison into the ground and not
 
01:44:29.709 --> 01:44:29.719 align:start position:0%
and have and leave it up to the industry
 
01:44:32.149 --> 01:44:32.159 align:start position:0%
to clean up representative H Haskins
 
01:44:34.870 --> 01:44:34.880 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um hopefully the
 
01:44:38.510 --> 01:44:38.520 align:start position:0%
moratorium is good but that's 28 that's
 
01:44:42.629 --> 01:44:42.639 align:start position:0%
not 34 and it's not 54 if Waste
 
01:44:46.629 --> 01:44:46.639 align:start position:0%
Management indeed extends the life of
 
01:44:49.310 --> 01:44:49.320 align:start position:0%
one that they have in the state which
 
01:44:51.149 --> 01:44:51.159 align:start position:0%
there's every reason to believe they
 
01:44:54.430 --> 01:44:54.440 align:start position:0%
will so again we don't have a capacity
 
01:44:57.270 --> 01:44:57.280 align:start position:0%
issue right now but we do have an issue
 
01:45:00.070 --> 01:45:00.080 align:start position:0%
of protecting our natural resources and
 
01:45:02.950 --> 01:45:02.960 align:start position:0%
our environment and anything we can do
 
01:45:06.589 --> 01:45:06.599 align:start position:0%
that favors that I think we should do
 
01:45:09.149 --> 01:45:09.159 align:start position:0%
represent kraton yeah I just wanted to
 
01:45:11.910 --> 01:45:11.920 align:start position:0%
to clarify the profitability
 
01:45:14.550 --> 01:45:14.560 align:start position:0%
statement it's not about the company
 
01:45:17.470 --> 01:45:17.480 align:start position:0%
making money it's it's about can the
 
01:45:20.070 --> 01:45:20.080 align:start position:0%
make money can the company make money
 
01:45:23.189 --> 01:45:23.199 align:start position:0%
and if you you if you set it up and the
 
01:45:24.790 --> 01:45:24.800 align:start position:0%
company can't make money on it then they
 
01:45:27.750 --> 01:45:27.760 align:start position:0%
won't come and now you have well okay
 
01:45:29.430 --> 01:45:29.440 align:start position:0%
that's great representative Duty they
 
01:45:31.350 --> 01:45:31.360 align:start position:0%
don't come so now what do we do with all
 
01:45:34.550 --> 01:45:34.560 align:start position:0%
our stuff and you know and so now you
 
01:45:36.510 --> 01:45:36.520 align:start position:0%
got more to representative Howard now
 
01:45:39.070 --> 01:45:39.080 align:start position:0%
you got more brand Fields because they
 
01:45:42.310 --> 01:45:42.320 align:start position:0%
left represent Dy thank you with all due
 
01:45:44.830 --> 01:45:44.840 align:start position:0%
respect representative kraton okay
 
01:45:47.390 --> 01:45:47.400 align:start position:0%
businesses are in business to make money
 
01:45:49.070 --> 01:45:49.080 align:start position:0%
if they can't make money they'll do
 
01:45:51.430 --> 01:45:51.440 align:start position:0%
something else if we we need those
 
01:45:53.629 --> 01:45:53.639 align:start position:0%
businesses to be here then we will do
 
01:45:55.070 --> 01:45:55.080 align:start position:0%
something else that's part of the
 
01:45:57.510 --> 01:45:57.520 align:start position:0%
negotiation that's part of the contract
 
01:46:00.910 --> 01:46:00.920 align:start position:0%
that's part of Coming to Terms okay um
 
01:46:02.870 --> 01:46:02.880 align:start position:0%
but the fact of the matter is and I
 
01:46:04.669 --> 01:46:04.679 align:start position:0%
don't know if any of you have been
 
01:46:08.070 --> 01:46:08.080 align:start position:0%
following the steart hospital A Private
 
01:46:11.270 --> 01:46:11.280 align:start position:0%
Hospital uh in in Boston that has
 
01:46:14.589 --> 01:46:14.599 align:start position:0%
basically gone bankrupt although the CEO
 
01:46:18.390 --> 01:46:18.400 align:start position:0%
has a $40 million yacht and I believe
 
01:46:19.870 --> 01:46:19.880 align:start position:0%
another one that he's building that
 
01:46:23.430 --> 01:46:23.440 align:start position:0%
might be $20 million at the same time
 
01:46:26.589 --> 01:46:26.599 align:start position:0%
they uh people are they have a lack of
 
01:46:28.430 --> 01:46:28.440 align:start position:0%
supplies because they haven't been
 
01:46:30.709 --> 01:46:30.719 align:start position:0%
paying their bills okay and the and the
 
01:46:32.950 --> 01:46:32.960 align:start position:0%
state of Massachusetts or whoever the US
 
01:46:34.950 --> 01:46:34.960 align:start position:0%
government is going to be stuck with
 
01:46:37.550 --> 01:46:37.560 align:start position:0%
that a private hospital so the same
 
01:46:39.589 --> 01:46:39.599 align:start position:0%
thing can become can happen here with
 
01:46:43.109 --> 01:46:43.119 align:start position:0%
landfills and I don't see a problem with
 
01:46:45.790 --> 01:46:45.800 align:start position:0%
having State ownership you know a
 
01:46:48.229 --> 01:46:48.239 align:start position:0%
partnership it's going to be run by a
 
01:46:50.510 --> 01:46:50.520 align:start position:0%
private company and you come to an
 
01:46:52.870 --> 01:46:52.880 align:start position:0%
agreement I mean that's basically it
 
01:46:55.149 --> 01:46:55.159 align:start position:0%
they need us for their business we need
 
01:46:57.390 --> 01:46:57.400 align:start position:0%
them you know to to handle the issue
 
01:47:00.629 --> 01:47:00.639 align:start position:0%
that we have that's how you do it okay
 
01:47:02.950 --> 01:47:02.960 align:start position:0%
um representative
 
01:47:02.960 --> 01:47:04.709 align:start position:0%
um representative
Katon

01:47:04.709 --> 01:47:04.719 align:start position:0%
Katon
 
01:47:08.550 --> 01:47:08.560 align:start position:0%
okay my point is representative Duty
 
01:47:08.560 --> 01:47:09.550 align:start position:0%
okay my point is representative Duty
representative

01:47:09.550 --> 01:47:09.560 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:47:11.550 --> 01:47:11.560 align:start position:0%
Duty representative
 
01:47:16.669 --> 01:47:16.679 align:start position:0%
Duty thank you my my point is why would
 
01:47:18.550 --> 01:47:18.560 align:start position:0%
we do
 
01:47:22.390 --> 01:47:22.400 align:start position:0%
something that would create that
 
01:47:25.070 --> 01:47:25.080 align:start position:0%
situation as opposed to working our way
 
01:47:27.430 --> 01:47:27.440 align:start position:0%
through it and not creating that
 
01:47:29.790 --> 01:47:29.800 align:start position:0%
situation and that that's my concern I
 
01:47:31.070 --> 01:47:31.080 align:start position:0%
don't know the answer but I don't want
 
01:47:33.390 --> 01:47:33.400 align:start position:0%
to create something that's a problem
 
01:47:35.350 --> 01:47:35.360 align:start position:0%
that doesn't have to be created just
 
01:47:37.310 --> 01:47:37.320 align:start position:0%
point of order but repes okay
 
01:47:40.950 --> 01:47:40.960 align:start position:0%
representative Katon it's not it it it's
 
01:47:43.189 --> 01:47:43.199 align:start position:0%
not a foregone conclusion hold on one
 
01:47:45.310 --> 01:47:45.320 align:start position:0%
second go ahead we just remember that
 
01:47:46.870 --> 01:47:46.880 align:start position:0%
the questions get directed through the
 
01:47:48.870 --> 01:47:48.880 align:start position:0%
chair and that we're not directly
 
01:47:51.109 --> 01:47:51.119 align:start position:0%
debating one another thank you you
 
01:47:54.990 --> 01:47:55.000 align:start position:0%
appreciate that okay continue your
 
01:47:57.149 --> 01:47:57.159 align:start position:0%
answer and then we'll go on to
 
01:47:57.159 --> 01:48:00.310 align:start position:0%
answer and then we'll go on to
representative

01:48:00.310 --> 01:48:00.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:02.589 --> 01:48:02.599 align:start position:0%
Bixby Madam
 
01:48:06.990 --> 01:48:07.000 align:start position:0%
chair with 35 years experience in
 
01:48:10.030 --> 01:48:10.040 align:start position:0%
business having worked with many
 
01:48:12.109 --> 01:48:12.119 align:start position:0%
governments around the
 
01:48:15.470 --> 01:48:15.480 align:start position:0%
world uh having to be a part of
 
01:48:15.480 --> 01:48:17.070 align:start position:0%
world uh having to be a part of
negotiating

01:48:17.070 --> 01:48:17.080 align:start position:0%
negotiating
 
01:48:21.070 --> 01:48:21.080 align:start position:0%
contracts uh for um very important
 
01:48:23.910 --> 01:48:23.920 align:start position:0%
things like issuing government
 
01:48:27.830 --> 01:48:27.840 align:start position:0%
passports I recognize that that is part
 
01:48:31.390 --> 01:48:31.400 align:start position:0%
of the business process okay you issue
 
01:48:34.070 --> 01:48:34.080 align:start position:0%
for example what we would probably do is
 
01:48:36.109 --> 01:48:36.119 align:start position:0%
issue a an
 
01:48:42.070 --> 01:48:42.080 align:start position:0%
RFP for uh people to apply uh to um uh
 
01:48:45.510 --> 01:48:45.520 align:start position:0%
work the landfill uh to operate the
 
01:48:48.189 --> 01:48:48.199 align:start position:0%
landfill and again I've said this before
 
01:48:50.950 --> 01:48:50.960 align:start position:0%
if nobody responds this then we're being
 
01:48:54.510 --> 01:48:54.520 align:start position:0%
unreasonable so then we change the RFP
 
01:48:56.550 --> 01:48:56.560 align:start position:0%
you know we work with industry you you
 
01:48:57.950 --> 01:48:57.960 align:start position:0%
work with them you say what's the
 
01:49:00.870 --> 01:49:00.880 align:start position:0%
problem here how can we come to terms
 
01:49:03.149 --> 01:49:03.159 align:start position:0%
well if you change this then we might be
 
01:49:05.629 --> 01:49:05.639 align:start position:0%
willing to bid on the project okay so we
 
01:49:08.109 --> 01:49:08.119 align:start position:0%
change that they bid on the project and
 
01:49:11.030 --> 01:49:11.040 align:start position:0%
it really is a public private
 
01:49:14.310 --> 01:49:14.320 align:start position:0%
partnership so it it doesn't have to be
 
01:49:16.270 --> 01:49:16.280 align:start position:0%
um contentious we just come to an
 
01:49:19.510 --> 01:49:19.520 align:start position:0%
agreement because we we have a problem
 
01:49:23.070 --> 01:49:23.080 align:start position:0%
to solve and Industry wants to make a
 
01:49:27.109 --> 01:49:27.119 align:start position:0%
profit that and that's fine so um you
 
01:49:32.470 --> 01:49:32.480 align:start position:0%
know that's works so I think that um
 
01:49:34.950 --> 01:49:34.960 align:start position:0%
it's pretty clear that uh there are some
 
01:49:39.550 --> 01:49:39.560 align:start position:0%
people who are in FA in favor of um 1145
 
01:49:42.750 --> 01:49:42.760 align:start position:0%
and there are some who were opposed and
 
01:49:44.950 --> 01:49:44.960 align:start position:0%
however much we talk in the next 15
 
01:49:47.510 --> 01:49:47.520 align:start position:0%
minutes or the next hour or the next you
 
01:49:49.790 --> 01:49:49.800 align:start position:0%
know however long that's probably not
 
01:49:52.629 --> 01:49:52.639 align:start position:0%
going to change so uh I suggest that we
 
01:49:55.830 --> 01:49:55.840 align:start position:0%
move on to the other business we have uh
 
01:49:58.790 --> 01:49:58.800 align:start position:0%
my so I am wondering if there is anyone
 
01:50:03.990 --> 01:50:04.000 align:start position:0%
who objects to uh the to uh
 
01:50:06.790 --> 01:50:06.800 align:start position:0%
1632 and if there are objections then
 
01:50:09.070 --> 01:50:09.080 align:start position:0%
bring those up otherwise I think and my
 
01:50:10.750 --> 01:50:10.760 align:start position:0%
sense is that we may be in pretty well
 
01:50:12.510 --> 01:50:12.520 align:start position:0%
in agreement on that if there's no
 
01:50:15.030 --> 01:50:15.040 align:start position:0%
objections to 1632 I suggest we move on
 
01:50:19.030 --> 01:50:19.040 align:start position:0%
to the other large animal in the room I
 
01:50:19.040 --> 01:50:21.950 align:start position:0%
to the other large animal in the room I
know

01:50:21.950 --> 01:50:21.960 align:start position:0%
know
 
01:50:26.229 --> 01:50:26.239 align:start position:0%
metaphorically speaking yes um uh yeah
 
01:50:29.510 --> 01:50:29.520 align:start position:0%
um for me I mean I I I would be uh in
 
01:50:34.550 --> 01:50:34.560 align:start position:0%
favor of uh HB 1632 I think a 15% cap on
 
01:50:37.430 --> 01:50:37.440 align:start position:0%
out of state trash is is very reasonable
 
01:50:39.510 --> 01:50:39.520 align:start position:0%
um representative Davis yes thank you
 
01:50:42.669 --> 01:50:42.679 align:start position:0%
madam chair I I'm in agreement with 1632
 
01:50:44.430 --> 01:50:44.440 align:start position:0%
and I think that would take care of the
 
01:50:47.229 --> 01:50:47.239 align:start position:0%
problem for 1145 we're trying to limit
 
01:50:48.550 --> 01:50:48.560 align:start position:0%
out of state
 
01:50:51.709 --> 01:50:51.719 align:start position:0%
trash okay well I think um I think we'
 
01:50:54.430 --> 01:50:54.440 align:start position:0%
pretty much um exhausted that and I know
 
01:50:55.870 --> 01:50:55.880 align:start position:0%
that we have some differences of
 
01:50:58.629 --> 01:50:58.639 align:start position:0%
philosophy in terms of private ownership
 
01:51:01.950 --> 01:51:01.960 align:start position:0%
versus uh State ownership or um
 
01:51:03.990 --> 01:51:04.000 align:start position:0%
Municipal ownership public ownership
 
01:51:06.310 --> 01:51:06.320 align:start position:0%
whatever you want to call it so with
 
01:51:09.310 --> 01:51:09.320 align:start position:0%
that I think um I'm going to move on
 
01:51:12.229 --> 01:51:12.239 align:start position:0%
from from those two landfill bills and
 
01:51:15.470 --> 01:51:15.480 align:start position:0%
we can then begin discussion on uh what
 
01:51:17.669 --> 01:51:17.679 align:start position:0%
we heard yesterday for HB
 
01:51:20.669 --> 01:51:20.679 align:start position:0%
1102 which is um relative to the
 
01:51:23.189 --> 01:51:23.199 align:start position:0%
definition of animal cruelty uh would
 
01:51:26.470 --> 01:51:26.480 align:start position:0%
somebody like to uh make some comment on
 
01:51:28.750 --> 01:51:28.760 align:start position:0%
testimony that they heard
 
01:51:30.870 --> 01:51:30.880 align:start position:0%
yesterday represent
 
01:51:34.709 --> 01:51:34.719 align:start position:0%
Penza um for people that weren't able to
 
01:51:37.629 --> 01:51:37.639 align:start position:0%
hear the um the entire hearing because
 
01:51:39.830 --> 01:51:39.840 align:start position:0%
it was long that were absent I think
 
01:51:42.950 --> 01:51:42.960 align:start position:0%
probably uh the best testimony came at
 
01:51:45.510 --> 01:51:45.520 align:start position:0%
the end and um from the woman that
 
01:51:48.910 --> 01:51:48.920 align:start position:0%
worked for the SPCA I think it was she
 
01:51:50.550 --> 01:51:50.560 align:start position:0%
was a veterinarian
 
01:51:54.669 --> 01:51:54.679 align:start position:0%
and um and I I really I appreciated
 
01:51:56.270 --> 01:51:56.280 align:start position:0%
everything that she said it was very
 
01:51:58.830 --> 01:51:58.840 align:start position:0%
thoughtful and gave just you know kind
 
01:52:02.069 --> 01:52:02.079 align:start position:0%
of all ends of the spectrum and in in
 
01:52:06.069 --> 01:52:06.079 align:start position:0%
realizing that um legislatively she
 
01:52:08.750 --> 01:52:08.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't see how this could be solved um
 
01:52:11.470 --> 01:52:11.480 align:start position:0%
but that it really needed to be um the
 
01:52:13.270 --> 01:52:13.280 align:start position:0%
stakeholders whether it be the you know
 
01:52:14.950 --> 01:52:14.960 align:start position:0%
in the situation whether it with the
 
01:52:18.629 --> 01:52:18.639 align:start position:0%
Breeders and veterinarians and um and
 
01:52:20.750 --> 01:52:20.760 align:start position:0%
whatnot that came together and that
 
01:52:23.709 --> 01:52:23.719 align:start position:0%
really that that worked out this issue
 
01:52:26.270 --> 01:52:26.280 align:start position:0%
in regards with you know the um the
 
01:52:28.510 --> 01:52:28.520 align:start position:0%
rating system and and all of that kind
 
01:52:28.520 --> 01:52:30.229 align:start position:0%
rating system and and all of that kind
of

01:52:30.229 --> 01:52:30.239 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:52:35.270 --> 01:52:35.280 align:start position:0%
stuff from from what I heard too
 
01:52:38.669 --> 01:52:38.679 align:start position:0%
um I think that the the the breeders in
 
01:52:45.189 --> 01:52:45.199 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire do a very good job um
 
01:52:49.470 --> 01:52:49.480 align:start position:0%
of breeding and raising animals in a
 
01:52:53.430 --> 01:52:53.440 align:start position:0%
very ethical and good way I think they
 
01:52:55.990 --> 01:52:56.000 align:start position:0%
are doing a great
 
01:53:00.709 --> 01:53:00.719 align:start position:0%
job um and also to um the testimony
 
01:53:03.069 --> 01:53:03.079 align:start position:0%
yesterday with regard to complaints to
 
01:53:06.189 --> 01:53:06.199 align:start position:0%
the AG's office um we haven't really
 
01:53:10.870 --> 01:53:10.880 align:start position:0%
heard of any issues with um you know
 
01:53:14.870 --> 01:53:14.880 align:start position:0%
animals being sold that are uh having
 
01:53:17.470 --> 01:53:17.480 align:start position:0%
problems their owners are spending
 
01:53:19.149 --> 01:53:19.159 align:start position:0%
thousands and thousands of dollars for
 
01:53:22.830 --> 01:53:22.840 align:start position:0%
surgeries and are claiming um you know
 
01:53:24.830 --> 01:53:24.840 align:start position:0%
some kind of problem consumer problem
 
01:53:26.750 --> 01:53:26.760 align:start position:0%
with the AG's office it's just doesn't
 
01:53:29.109 --> 01:53:29.119 align:start position:0%
seem to be happening and as we talked to
 
01:53:33.470 --> 01:53:33.480 align:start position:0%
several breeders who um who are not
 
01:53:35.550 --> 01:53:35.560 align:start position:0%
aware in their
 
01:53:40.470 --> 01:53:40.480 align:start position:0%
Community um of any major issues or
 
01:53:43.750 --> 01:53:43.760 align:start position:0%
higher percentages of animals that are
 
01:53:43.760 --> 01:53:44.669 align:start position:0%
higher percentages of animals that are
having

01:53:44.669 --> 01:53:44.679 align:start position:0%
having
 
01:53:47.750 --> 01:53:47.760 align:start position:0%
issues um
 
01:53:51.030 --> 01:53:51.040 align:start position:0%
and I think what we also heard was that
 
01:53:55.390 --> 01:53:55.400 align:start position:0%
you know Brey saili in and of itself is
 
01:53:58.790 --> 01:53:58.800 align:start position:0%
not an issue is not a problem it's it's
 
01:54:02.709 --> 01:54:02.719 align:start position:0%
a description of an animal skull um and
 
01:54:06.270 --> 01:54:06.280 align:start position:0%
it's it's not uh something that equates
 
01:54:10.270 --> 01:54:10.280 align:start position:0%
to illness or sickness there are brais
 
01:54:15.030 --> 01:54:15.040 align:start position:0%
spelic uh dogs pigs cats whatever that
 
01:54:17.910 --> 01:54:17.920 align:start position:0%
are perfectly healthy and there are no
 
01:54:21.669 --> 01:54:21.679 align:start position:0%
problems um I think
 
01:54:24.030 --> 01:54:24.040 align:start position:0%
they you know
 
01:54:27.589 --> 01:54:27.599 align:start position:0%
the the whole issue of intentionally
 
01:54:29.910 --> 01:54:29.920 align:start position:0%
breeding sick animals I don't know that
 
01:54:32.669 --> 01:54:32.679 align:start position:0%
our breeders would intentionally do that
 
01:54:35.149 --> 01:54:35.159 align:start position:0%
because look at they're trying to sell
 
01:54:39.750 --> 01:54:39.760 align:start position:0%
healthy animals so um so I I I just I
 
01:54:42.589 --> 01:54:42.599 align:start position:0%
see a lot of problems with this bill
 
01:54:45.390 --> 01:54:45.400 align:start position:0%

01:55:59.030 --> 01:55:59.040 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:56:02.629 --> 01:56:02.639 align:start position:0%
um we animal cruelty laws that prevent
 
01:56:05.149 --> 01:56:05.159 align:start position:0%
this type of issue uh from people from
 
01:56:07.550 --> 01:56:07.560 align:start position:0%
breeding like this it's probably why we
 
01:56:08.750 --> 01:56:08.760 align:start position:0%
don't hear a lot about it in New
 
01:56:10.629 --> 01:56:10.639 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but the other thing that
 
01:56:12.589 --> 01:56:12.599 align:start position:0%
really stuck out stuck out with me is
 
01:56:15.629 --> 01:56:15.639 align:start position:0%
because I have owned three of the
 
01:56:19.030 --> 01:56:19.040 align:start position:0%
breeds that are listed as break eelic a
 
01:56:19.040 --> 01:56:20.950 align:start position:0%
breeds that are listed as break eelic a
Rottweiler

01:56:20.950 --> 01:56:20.960 align:start position:0%
Rottweiler
 
01:56:20.960 --> 01:56:21.790 align:start position:0%
Rottweiler
a

01:56:21.790 --> 01:56:21.800 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:56:24.589 --> 01:56:24.599 align:start position:0%
sharp and a
 
01:56:28.629 --> 01:56:28.639 align:start position:0%
boxer all those dogs were healthy there
 
01:56:31.069 --> 01:56:31.079 align:start position:0%
was never any issues with
 
01:56:33.550 --> 01:56:33.560 align:start position:0%
them as someone who
 
01:56:39.189 --> 01:56:39.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:41.870 --> 01:56:41.880 align:start position:0%
crosses I can tell you that I have never
 
01:56:46.430 --> 01:56:46.440 align:start position:0%
had any issues with my girls I no longer
 
01:56:50.830 --> 01:56:50.840 align:start position:0%
breed so um have puppies but my girls
 
01:56:54.430 --> 01:56:54.440 align:start position:0%
and my sire never had any health issues
 
01:56:59.390 --> 01:56:59.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:02.550 --> 01:57:02.560 align:start position:0%
everything was selling over 30
 
01:57:06.069 --> 01:57:06.079 align:start position:0%
puppies I had ran into one person that
 
01:57:08.830 --> 01:57:08.840 align:start position:0%
got one of my puppies and it has all
 
01:57:11.870 --> 01:57:11.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:14.550 --> 01:57:14.560 align:start position:0%
allergies and when I ask these folks do
 
01:57:17.550 --> 01:57:17.560 align:start position:0%
you think it could be from environmental
 
01:57:20.189 --> 01:57:20.199 align:start position:0%
issues based on
 
01:57:23.830 --> 01:57:23.840 align:start position:0%
the owner of the dog they said yes we
 
01:57:26.709 --> 01:57:26.719 align:start position:0%
have to be cognizant that when people
 
01:57:31.069 --> 01:57:31.079 align:start position:0%
purchase a puppy or a dog sometimes they
 
01:57:33.149 --> 01:57:33.159 align:start position:0%
could be perfectly healthy but
 
01:57:36.149 --> 01:57:36.159 align:start position:0%
environmental issues like feeding it too
 
01:57:38.390 --> 01:57:38.400 align:start position:0%
much making it overweight not giving it
 
01:57:40.870 --> 01:57:40.880 align:start position:0%
an ex enough exercise putting it in a
 
01:57:43.750 --> 01:57:43.760 align:start position:0%
home where there's smoke can all cause
 
01:57:46.950 --> 01:57:46.960 align:start position:0%
issues that can lead to these what you
 
01:57:50.109 --> 01:57:50.119 align:start position:0%
know these severe health issues
 
01:57:53.109 --> 01:57:53.119 align:start position:0%
you can have the best intentions you can
 
01:57:56.990 --> 01:57:57.000 align:start position:0%
have no issues with your your
 
01:57:59.830 --> 01:57:59.840 align:start position:0%
animals and still have a
 
01:58:02.750 --> 01:58:02.760 align:start position:0%
puppy that you get passes the health
 
01:58:06.229 --> 01:58:06.239 align:start position:0%
certificate and you find out later on
 
01:58:07.750 --> 01:58:07.760 align:start position:0%
and the only thing I could contribut it
 
01:58:09.470 --> 01:58:09.480 align:start position:0%
to was the environmental issues and I
 
01:58:12.189 --> 01:58:12.199 align:start position:0%
just want everyone to we heard that
 
01:58:14.910 --> 01:58:14.920 align:start position:0%
testimony from both of those folks that
 
01:58:18.790 --> 01:58:18.800 align:start position:0%
environmental issues are huge in causing
 
01:58:20.550 --> 01:58:20.560 align:start position:0%
these problems
 
01:58:26.830 --> 01:58:26.840 align:start position:0%
represent Bixby yeah so um I see looking
 
01:58:30.830 --> 01:58:30.840 align:start position:0%
at the this bill I see two two sort of
 
01:58:34.390 --> 01:58:34.400 align:start position:0%
um sections or or way or angles on it uh
 
01:58:38.750 --> 01:58:38.760 align:start position:0%
one angle on it is what is the
 
01:58:40.950 --> 01:58:40.960 align:start position:0%
underlying problem and the other angle
 
01:58:45.229 --> 01:58:45.239 align:start position:0%
is what is the suggested remedy and I
 
01:58:49.550 --> 01:58:49.560 align:start position:0%
think that there uh there we did did
 
01:58:52.069 --> 01:58:52.079 align:start position:0%
have evidence that there is a problem
 
01:58:55.669 --> 01:58:55.679 align:start position:0%
among some dogs that uh have a brachos
 
01:59:01.109 --> 01:59:01.119 align:start position:0%
phalic uh um characteristic that uh
 
01:59:05.709 --> 01:59:05.719 align:start position:0%
there are health issues that can be uh
 
01:59:10.310 --> 01:59:10.320 align:start position:0%
either um cre there can be a a
 
01:59:13.470 --> 01:59:13.480 align:start position:0%
propensity towards it for the in in some
 
01:59:15.149 --> 01:59:15.159 align:start position:0%
dogs that have those characteristics but
 
01:59:20.470 --> 01:59:20.480 align:start position:0%
it is hardly a guarantee uh and that uh
 
01:59:24.189 --> 01:59:24.199 align:start position:0%
Al and so um maybe there's a higher
 
01:59:26.229 --> 01:59:26.239 align:start position:0%
probability of these problems but it's
 
01:59:30.310 --> 01:59:30.320 align:start position:0%
not a guarantee uh we can't necessarily
 
01:59:35.950 --> 01:59:35.960 align:start position:0%
eliminate that uh by uh or breeders
 
01:59:38.709 --> 01:59:38.719 align:start position:0%
cannot necessarily completely eliminate
 
01:59:41.510 --> 01:59:41.520 align:start position:0%
those problems by their breeding choices
 
01:59:43.470 --> 01:59:43.480 align:start position:0%
although they may be able to make some
 
01:59:48.069 --> 01:59:48.079 align:start position:0%
real progress it sounds like the uh AKC
 
01:59:52.069 --> 01:59:52.079 align:start position:0%
certified breed ERS do in fact work
 
01:59:55.430 --> 01:59:55.440 align:start position:0%
towards uh making sure that uh they are
 
01:59:57.229 --> 01:59:57.239 align:start position:0%
breeding towards a healthy
 
01:59:57.239 --> 01:59:58.830 align:start position:0%
breeding towards a healthy
standard

01:59:58.830 --> 01:59:58.840 align:start position:0%
standard
 
02:00:03.189 --> 02:00:03.199 align:start position:0%
uh however uh so so yes there is a
 
02:00:07.069 --> 02:00:07.079 align:start position:0%
problem out there exactly how it whether
 
02:00:09.310 --> 02:00:09.320 align:start position:0%
um exactly how much of a problem it's a
 
02:00:11.750 --> 02:00:11.760 align:start position:0%
little bit hard for us to gauge we heard
 
02:00:13.990 --> 02:00:14.000 align:start position:0%
a fair amount of conflicting testimony
 
02:00:16.709 --> 02:00:16.719 align:start position:0%
in terms of the solution this is where
 
02:00:18.229 --> 02:00:18.239 align:start position:0%
the this is what really kills the bill
 
02:00:21.750 --> 02:00:21.760 align:start position:0%
for me uh the solution is to put it into
 
02:00:24.310 --> 02:00:24.320 align:start position:0%
the animal cruelty statutes we had a
 
02:00:28.189 --> 02:00:28.199 align:start position:0%
description of how those how an animal
 
02:00:31.750 --> 02:00:31.760 align:start position:0%
cruelty investigation is carried out and
 
02:00:34.069 --> 02:00:34.079 align:start position:0%
given the way that it's carried out the
 
02:00:35.669 --> 02:00:35.679 align:start position:0%
language of the bill would make it
 
02:00:38.790 --> 02:00:38.800 align:start position:0%
impossible to actually execute a
 
02:00:42.669 --> 02:00:42.679 align:start position:0%
successful uh animal cruelty
 
02:00:45.229 --> 02:00:45.239 align:start position:0%
investigation uh
 
02:00:48.750 --> 02:00:48.760 align:start position:0%
with with the language that was uh
 
02:00:52.270 --> 02:00:52.280 align:start position:0%
laying out what was considered cruel uh
 
02:00:56.149 --> 02:00:56.159 align:start position:0%
so uh the fact that the the remedy is
 
02:01:03.390 --> 02:01:03.400 align:start position:0%
impossible and the uh and the problem is
 
02:01:06.709 --> 02:01:06.719 align:start position:0%
uh not entirely clearly
 
02:01:09.390 --> 02:01:09.400 align:start position:0%
defined uh and that the language in the
 
02:01:11.069 --> 02:01:11.079 align:start position:0%
bill that was trying to define the
 
02:01:13.830 --> 02:01:13.840 align:start position:0%
problem doesn't Define it does not
 
02:01:15.550 --> 02:01:15.560 align:start position:0%
define the problem very clearly I think
 
02:01:17.830 --> 02:01:17.840 align:start position:0%
that pretty much tells me that this is a
 
02:01:19.669 --> 02:01:19.679 align:start position:0%
bill that is
 
02:01:22.830 --> 02:01:22.840 align:start position:0%
sufficiently far from prime time that uh
 
02:01:25.350 --> 02:01:25.360 align:start position:0%
it it doesn't even deserve an interim
 
02:01:29.629 --> 02:01:29.639 align:start position:0%
study represent Howard um I just to
 
02:01:32.790 --> 02:01:32.800 align:start position:0%
piggy back on um uh on representative
 
02:01:34.990 --> 02:01:35.000 align:start position:0%
bixby's um description of the language I
 
02:01:36.750 --> 02:01:36.760 align:start position:0%
think that the language in the bill
 
02:01:39.229 --> 02:01:39.239 align:start position:0%
actually negates any possibility of it
 
02:01:41.629 --> 02:01:41.639 align:start position:0%
passing first of all um the reference to
 
02:01:43.430 --> 02:01:43.440 align:start position:0%
birth deformity we learned
 
02:01:45.709 --> 02:01:45.719 align:start position:0%
yesterday whether you whether you
 
02:01:48.310 --> 02:01:48.320 align:start position:0%
whether they thought that the the skull
 
02:01:51.149 --> 02:01:51.159 align:start position:0%
shape c cused the problem or not they
 
02:01:53.910 --> 02:01:53.920 align:start position:0%
all said that it was not a deformity so
 
02:01:56.189 --> 02:01:56.199 align:start position:0%
there's that and I also think that the
 
02:01:58.910 --> 02:01:58.920 align:start position:0%
inclusion of intentional breeding is
 
02:02:02.229 --> 02:02:02.239 align:start position:0%
hard to prove and um and probably not
 
02:02:03.790 --> 02:02:03.800 align:start position:0%
helpful to the language to the bill of
 
02:02:03.800 --> 02:02:04.550 align:start position:0%
helpful to the language to the bill of
the

02:02:04.550 --> 02:02:04.560 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:02:07.589 --> 02:02:07.599 align:start position:0%
bill representative Murray thank you
 
02:02:09.229 --> 02:02:09.239 align:start position:0%
madam chair um one of the other things
 
02:02:11.390 --> 02:02:11.400 align:start position:0%
that I thought um was worth mentioning
 
02:02:12.990 --> 02:02:13.000 align:start position:0%
and I I agree with representative
 
02:02:15.470 --> 02:02:15.480 align:start position:0%
penza's Point um with the last person
 
02:02:17.830 --> 02:02:17.840 align:start position:0%
who testified there was conversation
 
02:02:20.310 --> 02:02:20.320 align:start position:0%
about sort of
 
02:02:22.669 --> 02:02:22.679 align:start position:0%
uh national language around this as well
 
02:02:24.790 --> 02:02:24.800 align:start position:0%
and I thought that sort of that was a
 
02:02:27.310 --> 02:02:27.320 align:start position:0%
very powerful statement as to the
 
02:02:30.310 --> 02:02:30.320 align:start position:0%
direction of of um what breed standards
 
02:02:32.229 --> 02:02:32.239 align:start position:0%
were're looking at or those types of
 
02:02:33.990 --> 02:02:34.000 align:start position:0%
things and then there was also testimony
 
02:02:38.270 --> 02:02:38.280 align:start position:0%
around Boaz Boaz testing metrics to uh
 
02:02:42.629 --> 02:02:42.639 align:start position:0%
have puppies um tested for pre-existing
 
02:02:44.709 --> 02:02:44.719 align:start position:0%
health conditions so for everything
 
02:02:46.350 --> 02:02:46.360 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby said I agree
 
02:02:48.030 --> 02:02:48.040 align:start position:0%
wholeheartedly with some of the the
 
02:02:51.950 --> 02:02:51.960 align:start position:0%
flaws around that and so um that's
 
02:02:54.310 --> 02:02:54.320 align:start position:0%
really where I am at on it as well
 
02:02:54.320 --> 02:02:55.709 align:start position:0%
really where I am at on it as well
represent

02:02:55.709 --> 02:02:55.719 align:start position:0%
represent
 
02:02:58.990 --> 02:02:59.000 align:start position:0%
Kenny um yes thank you for um taking my
 
02:03:02.149 --> 02:03:02.159 align:start position:0%
question um statement I have worked in
 
02:03:05.470 --> 02:03:05.480 align:start position:0%
the veterinary field since I was 16 and
 
02:03:08.510 --> 02:03:08.520 align:start position:0%
the majority of my career has been in
 
02:03:11.030 --> 02:03:11.040 align:start position:0%
veterinary hospitals I actually worked
 
02:03:15.830 --> 02:03:15.840 align:start position:0%
with the last speaker um so um I really
 
02:03:18.470 --> 02:03:18.480 align:start position:0%
felt that the end of the day really
 
02:03:18.480 --> 02:03:19.430 align:start position:0%
felt that the end of the day really
present

02:03:19.430 --> 02:03:19.440 align:start position:0%
present
 
02:03:22.589 --> 02:03:22.599 align:start position:0%
more of what was really happening and um
 
02:03:25.510 --> 02:03:25.520 align:start position:0%
one of the Breeders I remembered from
 
02:03:28.109 --> 02:03:28.119 align:start position:0%
when I was at the um animal hospital
 
02:03:29.950 --> 02:03:29.960 align:start position:0%
I've worked with many breeders over the
 
02:03:34.189 --> 02:03:34.199 align:start position:0%
years they are truly devoted to their
 
02:03:37.229 --> 02:03:37.239 align:start position:0%
animals and doing the best whether it's
 
02:03:40.149 --> 02:03:40.159 align:start position:0%
cats or dogs so I really feel that this
 
02:03:44.030 --> 02:03:44.040 align:start position:0%
bill is really we can't legislate this I
 
02:03:46.510 --> 02:03:46.520 align:start position:0%
really feel like it's not something I
 
02:03:49.430 --> 02:03:49.440 align:start position:0%
think it's something that needs to be
 
02:03:52.669 --> 02:03:52.679 align:start position:0%
um through the um
 
02:03:55.910 --> 02:03:55.920 align:start position:0%
AKC and breeders and veterinarians to
 
02:03:58.750 --> 02:03:58.760 align:start position:0%
really solve this and that they really
 
02:04:02.470 --> 02:04:02.480 align:start position:0%
need to do the work and I think that the
 
02:04:06.390 --> 02:04:06.400 align:start position:0%
breeders in New Hampshire um are
 
02:04:06.400 --> 02:04:08.149 align:start position:0%
breeders in New Hampshire um are
extremely

02:04:08.149 --> 02:04:08.159 align:start position:0%
extremely
 
02:04:11.950 --> 02:04:11.960 align:start position:0%
um conscientious so I really feel that
 
02:04:16.149 --> 02:04:16.159 align:start position:0%
this is something that uh we really need
 
02:04:19.390 --> 02:04:19.400 align:start position:0%
to itl thank you
 
02:04:19.400 --> 02:04:21.229 align:start position:0%
to itl thank you
representative

02:04:21.229 --> 02:04:21.239 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:04:24.629 --> 02:04:24.639 align:start position:0%
kraton thank you madam chair yeah I'd
 
02:04:27.189 --> 02:04:27.199 align:start position:0%
also like to go back to Dr Parker or Dr
 
02:04:30.270 --> 02:04:30.280 align:start position:0%
Proctor rather when she said that and as
 
02:04:31.990 --> 02:04:32.000 align:start position:0%
I reread the bill I think she's right
 
02:04:35.350 --> 02:04:35.360 align:start position:0%
the impact on the animal shelters so you
 
02:04:36.750 --> 02:04:36.760 align:start position:0%
know you're going to get these animals
 
02:04:38.270 --> 02:04:38.280 align:start position:0%
regardless of how they're bred or how
 
02:04:40.310 --> 02:04:40.320 align:start position:0%
where they came up from and the animal
 
02:04:42.189 --> 02:04:42.199 align:start position:0%
shelters then can't sell them based on
 
02:04:44.229 --> 02:04:44.239 align:start position:0%
this law I think that's a second or
 
02:04:46.069 --> 02:04:46.079 align:start position:0%
third order effect that we probably
 
02:04:46.079 --> 02:04:47.750 align:start position:0%
third order effect that we probably
wouldn't

02:04:47.750 --> 02:04:47.760 align:start position:0%
wouldn't
 
02:04:51.109 --> 02:04:51.119 align:start position:0%
want represent H Haskins thank you madam
 
02:04:54.069 --> 02:04:54.079 align:start position:0%
chair I just want to go on record to say
 
02:04:56.870 --> 02:04:56.880 align:start position:0%
that I learned a lot
 
02:05:00.709 --> 02:05:00.719 align:start position:0%
yesterday and I'm we always do I'm very
 
02:05:03.709 --> 02:05:03.719 align:start position:0%
grateful to the sponsor for putting the
 
02:05:07.069 --> 02:05:07.079 align:start position:0%
bill forward because there was so much I
 
02:05:09.149 --> 02:05:09.159 align:start position:0%
didn't know about my own
 
02:05:11.669 --> 02:05:11.679 align:start position:0%
granddogs and I'm going to take that
 
02:05:14.310 --> 02:05:14.320 align:start position:0%
information back to my children because
 
02:05:16.350 --> 02:05:16.360 align:start position:0%
I'm thinking that they don't know some
 
02:05:18.750 --> 02:05:18.760 align:start position:0%
of the things that I learned yesterday
 
02:05:20.950 --> 02:05:20.960 align:start position:0%
one of whom spent thousands of dollarss
 
02:05:23.109 --> 02:05:23.119 align:start position:0%
to have um a
 
02:05:26.270 --> 02:05:26.280 align:start position:0%
terrier uh hospitalized because
 
02:05:26.280 --> 02:05:27.910 align:start position:0%
terrier uh hospitalized because
apparently

02:05:27.910 --> 02:05:27.920 align:start position:0%
apparently
 
02:05:31.990 --> 02:05:32.000 align:start position:0%
the spaying did the surgery did not go
 
02:05:34.109 --> 02:05:34.119 align:start position:0%
well so they went through a very
 
02:05:37.069 --> 02:05:37.079 align:start position:0%
reputable breeder but things happen and
 
02:05:40.430 --> 02:05:40.440 align:start position:0%
go wrong but anyway um hats off to the
 
02:05:43.750 --> 02:05:43.760 align:start position:0%
sponsor for allowing us to hear the
 
02:05:47.430 --> 02:05:47.440 align:start position:0%
information that was um very informative
 
02:05:50.229 --> 02:05:50.239 align:start position:0%
and useful well I have to say too you
 
02:05:53.030 --> 02:05:53.040 align:start position:0%
know I guess you most of us are dog
 
02:05:55.430 --> 02:05:55.440 align:start position:0%
owners or know people have dogs or
 
02:05:58.310 --> 02:05:58.320 align:start position:0%
whatever and and I I can't seem to get
 
02:06:00.189 --> 02:06:00.199 align:start position:0%
away from the fact that when when you
 
02:06:01.310 --> 02:06:01.320 align:start position:0%
adopt a
 
02:06:04.390 --> 02:06:04.400 align:start position:0%
pup there's always going to be something
 
02:06:09.510 --> 02:06:09.520 align:start position:0%
that happens I mean we've got a um a um
 
02:06:12.030 --> 02:06:12.040 align:start position:0%
dog a black lab
 
02:06:14.830 --> 02:06:14.840 align:start position:0%
Ridgeback and um one of the one of the
 
02:06:16.790 --> 02:06:16.800 align:start position:0%
things of that breed is because of the
 
02:06:19.750 --> 02:06:19.760 align:start position:0%
ridgeback sometimes there's a hair on
 
02:06:23.669 --> 02:06:23.679 align:start position:0%
the back that grows into the spine and
 
02:06:25.790 --> 02:06:25.800 align:start position:0%
they end up getting an abscess and it's
 
02:06:29.910 --> 02:06:29.920 align:start position:0%
it's um it's a thing it cost us several
 
02:06:32.109 --> 02:06:32.119 align:start position:0%
thousands of dollars for surgery to have
 
02:06:36.629 --> 02:06:36.639 align:start position:0%
that taken care of um and have that hair
 
02:06:38.669 --> 02:06:38.679 align:start position:0%
extracted and removed and all the
 
02:06:40.990 --> 02:06:41.000 align:start position:0%
abscess and everything cleared out so I
 
02:06:43.470 --> 02:06:43.480 align:start position:0%
mean you just never know with some of
 
02:06:45.830 --> 02:06:45.840 align:start position:0%
these breeds what kinds of things are
 
02:06:49.870 --> 02:06:49.880 align:start position:0%
going to happen and I I don't you know I
 
02:06:52.310 --> 02:06:52.320 align:start position:0%
don't know if that would the breeder
 
02:06:55.430 --> 02:06:55.440 align:start position:0%
would have come under this kind of um of
 
02:06:58.030 --> 02:06:58.040 align:start position:0%
legislation is that considered a birth
 
02:07:00.950 --> 02:07:00.960 align:start position:0%
deformity is that something a ridgeback
 
02:07:03.350 --> 02:07:03.360 align:start position:0%
is that something that would fall under
 
02:07:05.470 --> 02:07:05.480 align:start position:0%
this and then so what happens to that
 
02:07:07.910 --> 02:07:07.920 align:start position:0%
breed you're no no longer able to breed
 
02:07:12.310 --> 02:07:12.320 align:start position:0%
those animals um so I I I just there's a
 
02:07:15.350 --> 02:07:15.360 align:start position:0%
lot that's packed into this language
 
02:07:19.390 --> 02:07:19.400 align:start position:0%
here that um I I just I can't agree with
 
02:07:23.109 --> 02:07:23.119 align:start position:0%
and um and I get it you know there's
 
02:07:24.589 --> 02:07:24.599 align:start position:0%
there's some people out there that may
 
02:07:27.310 --> 02:07:27.320 align:start position:0%
be wanting to go to extremes with
 
02:07:30.549 --> 02:07:30.559 align:start position:0%
certain uh characteristics of animals
 
02:07:32.350 --> 02:07:32.360 align:start position:0%
but I mean how do you prove intent how
 
02:07:36.030 --> 02:07:36.040 align:start position:0%
do you prove a lot of this is as what uh
 
02:07:38.470 --> 02:07:38.480 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby had pointed out in
 
02:07:40.270 --> 02:07:40.280 align:start position:0%
any case are there any other comments
 
02:07:43.470 --> 02:07:43.480 align:start position:0%
regarding this bill I think that uh we
 
02:07:45.709 --> 02:07:45.719 align:start position:0%
can probably move
 
02:07:49.790 --> 02:07:49.800 align:start position:0%
on yep oh represent fenza just wanted to
 
02:07:52.030 --> 02:07:52.040 align:start position:0%
um do the same thing that representative
 
02:07:56.750 --> 02:07:56.760 align:start position:0%
has Haskins said in hats off to um to to
 
02:07:59.030 --> 02:07:59.040 align:start position:0%
bringing this forward I mean there was I
 
02:08:01.149 --> 02:08:01.159 align:start position:0%
don't know I'm new here but this was the
 
02:08:03.229 --> 02:08:03.239 align:start position:0%
bit busiest that we've ever been in here
 
02:08:06.189 --> 02:08:06.199 align:start position:0%
and um and it was uh it was it was
 
02:08:08.270 --> 02:08:08.280 align:start position:0%
exciting and um I know that there was
 
02:08:09.750 --> 02:08:09.760 align:start position:0%
you know a little bit of stuff but for
 
02:08:11.930 --> 02:08:11.940 align:start position:0%
the most part I think that
 
02:08:11.940 --> 02:08:12.990 align:start position:0%
the most part I think that
[Music]

02:08:12.990 --> 02:08:13.000 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:08:16.510 --> 02:08:16.520 align:start position:0%
um you know sometimes healing from the
 
02:08:18.910 --> 02:08:18.920 align:start position:0%
woman that spoke which was uh that was
 
02:08:21.270 --> 02:08:21.280 align:start position:0%
really hard to hear and uh and bringing
 
02:08:24.790 --> 02:08:24.800 align:start position:0%
this forward I think is um is huge and
 
02:08:26.750 --> 02:08:26.760 align:start position:0%
maybe that means that these parties that
 
02:08:29.870 --> 02:08:29.880 align:start position:0%
can fix this outside of legislatively
 
02:08:32.830 --> 02:08:32.840 align:start position:0%
can really um to work towards um making
 
02:08:35.430 --> 02:08:35.440 align:start position:0%
something happen but um facilitating
 
02:08:37.350 --> 02:08:37.360 align:start position:0%
this I think was great and and thank you
 
02:08:37.360 --> 02:08:38.870 align:start position:0%
this I think was great and and thank you
for

02:08:38.870 --> 02:08:38.880 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:08:41.830 --> 02:08:41.840 align:start position:0%
that represent Bixby yeah I'd also like
 
02:08:46.030 --> 02:08:46.040 align:start position:0%
to thank the chair for her uh carefully
 
02:08:47.870 --> 02:08:47.880 align:start position:0%
setting the tone at the beginning of the
 
02:08:51.510 --> 02:08:51.520 align:start position:0%
hearing to uh alleviate as much as
 
02:08:53.430 --> 02:08:53.440 align:start position:0%
possible of the tension that tends to
 
02:08:55.990 --> 02:08:56.000 align:start position:0%
come up in these hearings because I have
 
02:08:59.350 --> 02:08:59.360 align:start position:0%
seen some animal hearings in my past
 
02:09:01.790 --> 02:09:01.800 align:start position:0%
that have been extremely fraught and I
 
02:09:04.589 --> 02:09:04.599 align:start position:0%
thought that on the whole the entire
 
02:09:06.709 --> 02:09:06.719 align:start position:0%
tone throughout the four hours plus of
 
02:09:09.709 --> 02:09:09.719 align:start position:0%
testimony was quite civil thank you I
 
02:09:12.069 --> 02:09:12.079 align:start position:0%
appreciate that thank
 
02:09:14.910 --> 02:09:14.920 align:start position:0%
you takes a committee I'll tell you you
 
02:09:17.030 --> 02:09:17.040 align:start position:0%
guys did a great job too and hanging in
 
02:09:20.310 --> 02:09:20.320 align:start position:0%
there for for um that length of time um
 
02:09:21.990 --> 02:09:22.000 align:start position:0%
in any case I'd like to close out our
 
02:09:22.000 --> 02:09:22.950 align:start position:0%
in any case I'd like to close out our
work

02:09:22.950 --> 02:09:22.960 align:start position:0%
work
 
02:09:25.870 --> 02:09:25.880 align:start position:0%
session and uh I guess it's time for us
 
02:09:29.109 --> 02:09:29.119 align:start position:0%
to uh move along to a
 
02:09:35.990 --> 02:09:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:39.589 --> 02:09:39.599 align:start position:0%
today um let's see HB
 
02:09:47.310 --> 02:09:47.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:47.320 --> 02:09:54.910 align:start position:0%
 
gavel

02:09:54.910 --> 02:09:54.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:58.709 --> 02:09:58.719 align:start position:0%
okay I'm going to open up um the hearing
 
02:10:02.470 --> 02:10:02.480 align:start position:0%
on hb1 1463 establishing a committee to
 
02:10:04.709 --> 02:10:04.719 align:start position:0%
study the effects of laws relative to
 
02:10:07.350 --> 02:10:07.360 align:start position:0%
the production of beef pork and poultry
 
02:10:10.830 --> 02:10:10.840 align:start position:0%
and our um sponsor of the bill uh
 
02:10:13.990 --> 02:10:14.000 align:start position:0%
representative ktoa take it away thank
 
02:10:15.790 --> 02:10:15.800 align:start position:0%
you madam chair for the record uh
 
02:10:18.990 --> 02:10:19.000 align:start position:0%
representative coma representing map 7
 
02:10:21.750 --> 02:10:21.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:26.270 --> 02:10:26.280 align:start position:0%
Alton um this bill came about due to a
 
02:10:27.990 --> 02:10:28.000 align:start position:0%
study committee that represented Bixby
 
02:10:31.790 --> 02:10:31.800 align:start position:0%
and I were on uh when we heard
 
02:10:31.800 --> 02:10:33.390 align:start position:0%
and I were on uh when we heard
uh

02:10:33.390 --> 02:10:33.400 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:10:35.189 --> 02:10:35.199 align:start position:0%
testimony from people in the
 
02:10:39.270 --> 02:10:39.280 align:start position:0%
agricultural industry um
 
02:10:42.149 --> 02:10:42.159 align:start position:0%
that were receiving different
 
02:10:46.189 --> 02:10:46.199 align:start position:0%
information regarding laws
 
02:10:49.470 --> 02:10:49.480 align:start position:0%
um and it was conflict
 
02:10:52.790 --> 02:10:52.800 align:start position:0%
conflicting and what we discovered is or
 
02:10:56.750 --> 02:10:56.760 align:start position:0%
what I discovered was that if
 
02:11:00.950 --> 02:11:00.960 align:start position:0%
you use one law at the federal level you
 
02:11:02.990 --> 02:11:03.000 align:start position:0%
can't use a state law if you use state
 
02:11:05.109 --> 02:11:05.119 align:start position:0%
law you can't use another state law
 
02:11:07.709 --> 02:11:07.719 align:start position:0%
there's very conflicting information out
 
02:11:09.830 --> 02:11:09.840 align:start position:0%
there and it's very
 
02:11:14.390 --> 02:11:14.400 align:start position:0%
confusing and when we spoke to these
 
02:11:19.750 --> 02:11:19.760 align:start position:0%
Farmers uh in the meat industry
 
02:11:21.790 --> 02:11:21.800 align:start position:0%
they thought it would be a great idea to
 
02:11:25.430 --> 02:11:25.440 align:start position:0%
have all the information in one spot and
 
02:11:29.270 --> 02:11:29.280 align:start position:0%
POS and have um it on the State website
 
02:11:31.589 --> 02:11:31.599 align:start position:0%
and possibly a brochure or some type of
 
02:11:34.270 --> 02:11:34.280 align:start position:0%
report so there's just one place you can
 
02:11:39.589 --> 02:11:39.599 align:start position:0%
go to uh to know what to do instead of
 
02:11:42.709 --> 02:11:42.719 align:start position:0%
searching um in
 
02:11:45.589 --> 02:11:45.599 align:start position:0%
agriculture um I I used the old adage I
 
02:11:47.709 --> 02:11:47.719 align:start position:0%
thought I was pretty up to date on
 
02:11:49.549 --> 02:11:49.559 align:start position:0%
things until until I get involved in uh
 
02:11:51.069 --> 02:11:51.079 align:start position:0%
Agriculture and then I've realized I
 
02:11:56.189 --> 02:11:56.199 align:start position:0%
knew nothing um because of so many laws
 
02:11:57.549 --> 02:11:57.559 align:start position:0%
that are on the books that you have to
 
02:12:01.189 --> 02:12:01.199 align:start position:0%
deal with um people do not realize it
 
02:12:05.350 --> 02:12:05.360 align:start position:0%
and so I think just to start and get
 
02:12:05.360 --> 02:12:06.229 align:start position:0%
and so I think just to start and get
this

02:12:06.229 --> 02:12:06.239 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:12:09.709 --> 02:12:09.719 align:start position:0%
portion in one area will be extremely
 
02:12:12.870 --> 02:12:12.880 align:start position:0%
helpful to the farmers in our state and
 
02:12:16.430 --> 02:12:16.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:20.109 --> 02:12:20.119 align:start position:0%
questions Okay so um so this sets up a
 
02:12:20.119 --> 02:12:21.229 align:start position:0%
questions Okay so um so this sets up a
study

02:12:21.229 --> 02:12:21.239 align:start position:0%
study
 
02:12:24.149 --> 02:12:24.159 align:start position:0%
committee yes and ostensively
 
02:12:27.109 --> 02:12:27.119 align:start position:0%
um so the the study committee is
 
02:12:30.030 --> 02:12:30.040 align:start position:0%
supposed to be presenting the report
 
02:12:32.990 --> 02:12:33.000 align:start position:0%
November 1st so we would have to have
 
02:12:36.470 --> 02:12:36.480 align:start position:0%
that done this year correct correct okay
 
02:12:36.480 --> 02:12:38.669 align:start position:0%
that done this year correct correct okay
and

02:12:38.669 --> 02:12:38.679 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:12:41.589 --> 02:12:41.599 align:start position:0%
um judging from
 
02:12:45.310 --> 02:12:45.320 align:start position:0%
the the subject
 
02:12:48.270 --> 02:12:48.280 align:start position:0%
matter do you have a sense of how many
 
02:12:52.310 --> 02:12:52.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:52.320 --> 02:12:54.549 align:start position:0%
 
meet

02:12:54.549 --> 02:12:54.559 align:start position:0%
meet
 
02:12:58.549 --> 02:12:58.559 align:start position:0%
um it's going to take work I can tell
 
02:13:02.229 --> 02:13:02.239 align:start position:0%
you that um we're going to need to uh
 
02:13:05.030 --> 02:13:05.040 align:start position:0%
utilize uh the
 
02:13:10.510 --> 02:13:10.520 align:start position:0%
researcher we're going to um really need
 
02:13:12.629 --> 02:13:12.639 align:start position:0%
guidance from the Department of
 
02:13:15.870 --> 02:13:15.880 align:start position:0%
Agriculture from the
 
02:13:19.589 --> 02:13:19.599 align:start position:0%
USDA and you know I know that it only
 
02:13:22.430 --> 02:13:22.440 align:start position:0%
says here for beef pork and poultry
 
02:13:25.030 --> 02:13:25.040 align:start position:0%
producers but I have people contacting
 
02:13:26.990 --> 02:13:27.000 align:start position:0%
me can you please include this can you
 
02:13:32.990 --> 02:13:33.000 align:start position:0%
please include that PE people want this
 
02:13:37.189 --> 02:13:37.199 align:start position:0%
so I think that we can try but I think
 
02:13:40.069 --> 02:13:40.079 align:start position:0%
that beef pork and poultry are what we
 
02:13:42.069 --> 02:13:42.079 align:start position:0%
produce most of I know people want us to
 
02:13:45.589 --> 02:13:45.599 align:start position:0%
include bison and elk and other uh meats
 
02:13:48.270 --> 02:13:48.280 align:start position:0%
that we produce in the state in red tail
 
02:13:51.589 --> 02:13:51.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:55.510 --> 02:13:55.520 align:start position:0%
but I think it's extremely important
 
02:14:00.430 --> 02:14:00.440 align:start position:0%
that this be a start I don't know if
 
02:14:02.830 --> 02:14:02.840 align:start position:0%
we'll get to everything but I think we
 
02:14:05.270 --> 02:14:05.280 align:start position:0%
need to start somewhere representative
 
02:14:07.109 --> 02:14:07.119 align:start position:0%
Howard I just have a quick question
 
02:14:09.629 --> 02:14:09.639 align:start position:0%
about the um the entity so it's it's its
 
02:14:12.430 --> 02:14:12.440 align:start position:0%
own committee so I see down here under
 
02:14:14.229 --> 02:14:14.239 align:start position:0%
number five the report go does not go
 
02:14:15.790 --> 02:14:15.800 align:start position:0%
through this committee it goes directly
 
02:14:17.629 --> 02:14:17.639 align:start position:0%
to the speaker is that is that routine
 
02:14:17.639 --> 02:14:18.510 align:start position:0%
to the speaker is that is that routine
and

02:14:18.510 --> 02:14:18.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:14:20.470 --> 02:14:20.480 align:start position:0%
and um would we would the committee
 
02:14:23.030 --> 02:14:23.040 align:start position:0%
contribute any this committee contribute
 
02:14:25.310 --> 02:14:25.320 align:start position:0%
anything uh no that is routine that it
 
02:14:27.069 --> 02:14:27.079 align:start position:0%
would go through the speaker um it would
 
02:14:29.390 --> 02:14:29.400 align:start position:0%
be a separate committee unto this
 
02:14:33.470 --> 02:14:33.480 align:start position:0%
committee representative Bixby so um
 
02:14:36.069 --> 02:14:36.079 align:start position:0%
according to the bill the project of
 
02:14:38.430 --> 02:14:38.440 align:start position:0%
this committee is going to be a report
 
02:14:41.470 --> 02:14:41.480 align:start position:0%
uh and but uh it sounds like your
 
02:14:44.830 --> 02:14:44.840 align:start position:0%
ultimate goal is to have a u public
 
02:14:46.549 --> 02:14:46.559 align:start position:0%
education document that would come out
 
02:14:48.750 --> 02:14:48.760 align:start position:0%
of it and how would that publication
 
02:14:51.030 --> 02:14:51.040 align:start position:0%
document get
 
02:14:53.629 --> 02:14:53.639 align:start position:0%
created well you are correct
 
02:14:56.109 --> 02:14:56.119 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby it is my goal is
 
02:14:58.390 --> 02:14:58.400 align:start position:0%
for a public education document I think
 
02:15:00.990 --> 02:15:01.000 align:start position:0%
that the report through the work that
 
02:15:03.870 --> 02:15:03.880 align:start position:0%
the committee does will we will be
 
02:15:05.750 --> 02:15:05.760 align:start position:0%
discovering a lot of the stuff that's
 
02:15:08.229 --> 02:15:08.239 align:start position:0%
going on and I think from that report a
 
02:15:10.910 --> 02:15:10.920 align:start position:0%
public education document could be
 
02:15:13.830 --> 02:15:13.840 align:start position:0%
formed and follow up follow up okay and
 
02:15:16.030 --> 02:15:16.040 align:start position:0%
who would be responsible for
 
02:15:18.350 --> 02:15:18.360 align:start position:0%
promulgating that public education
 
02:15:20.830 --> 02:15:20.840 align:start position:0%
education document would that go would
 
02:15:23.470 --> 02:15:23.480 align:start position:0%
that go through the department website
 
02:15:26.750 --> 02:15:26.760 align:start position:0%
for in perhaps and if so would we need
 
02:15:28.629 --> 02:15:28.639 align:start position:0%
to do anything other than just ask them
 
02:15:32.229 --> 02:15:32.239 align:start position:0%
pretty please I would ask them pretty
 
02:15:34.750 --> 02:15:34.760 align:start position:0%
please okay represent
 
02:15:37.470 --> 02:15:37.480 align:start position:0%
muray thank you madam chair and uh thank
 
02:15:38.750 --> 02:15:38.760 align:start position:0%
you to the sponsor for taking my
 
02:15:42.390 --> 02:15:42.400 align:start position:0%
question I um a question that I do have
 
02:15:44.830 --> 02:15:44.840 align:start position:0%
regarding the report um because this
 
02:15:47.109 --> 02:15:47.119 align:start position:0%
committee does have oversight over a
 
02:15:49.149 --> 02:15:49.159 align:start position:0%
fair amount of this are you open to the
 
02:15:52.109 --> 02:15:52.119 align:start position:0%
possibility of in the inclusion um a
 
02:15:54.629 --> 02:15:54.639 align:start position:0%
copy of the report being sent to house
 
02:15:57.229 --> 02:15:57.239 align:start position:0%
environment and agriculture of course
 
02:16:00.629 --> 02:16:00.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:06.750 --> 02:16:06.760 align:start position:0%
you represent Bixby so um in the uh in
 
02:16:08.750 --> 02:16:08.760 align:start position:0%
interest of legislative efficiency I
 
02:16:11.470 --> 02:16:11.480 align:start position:0%
think that we might not need to have
 
02:16:13.390 --> 02:16:13.400 align:start position:0%
that report officially sent to the
 
02:16:15.229 --> 02:16:15.239 align:start position:0%
committee by having an amendment on the
 
02:16:17.830 --> 02:16:17.840 align:start position:0%
bill right because I I think I'd like to
 
02:16:20.830 --> 02:16:20.840 align:start position:0%
see I'd like to see us uh EXA this bill
 
02:16:23.350 --> 02:16:23.360 align:start position:0%
in not too terribly long could could we
 
02:16:26.270 --> 02:16:26.280 align:start position:0%
do that now uh well I think we we' have
 
02:16:28.030 --> 02:16:28.040 align:start position:0%
to close the hearing and open an ex
 
02:16:30.109 --> 02:16:30.119 align:start position:0%

02:16:33.309 --> 02:16:33.319 align:start position:0%
sponsor would be willing oh
 
02:16:35.990 --> 02:16:36.000 align:start position:0%

02:17:02.669 --> 02:17:02.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:09.589 --> 02:17:09.599 align:start position:0%

02:21:23.710 --> 02:21:23.720 align:start position:0%
1628 uh is the result of a study
 
02:21:27.309 --> 02:21:27.319 align:start position:0%
committee that uh we put together uh in
 
02:21:30.469 --> 02:21:30.479 align:start position:0%
response to a bill we heard last year uh
 
02:21:33.070 --> 02:21:33.080 align:start position:0%
that was just looking at making some
 
02:21:37.190 --> 02:21:37.200 align:start position:0%
changes to the oversight of Apple uh um
 
02:21:39.870 --> 02:21:39.880 align:start position:0%
the Apple inspection
 
02:21:45.469 --> 02:21:45.479 align:start position:0%
and uh so uh we had a study committee
 
02:21:48.150 --> 02:21:48.160 align:start position:0%
with um myself and representative kraton
 
02:21:50.349 --> 02:21:50.359 align:start position:0%
representative Ankerberg and Senator
 
02:21:54.070 --> 02:21:54.080 align:start position:0%
Pearl uh and we looked through all of
 
02:21:57.190 --> 02:21:57.200 align:start position:0%
chapters uh 426 and
 
02:22:00.070 --> 02:22:00.080 align:start position:0%
434 to figure out which elements of
 
02:22:03.670 --> 02:22:03.680 align:start position:0%
those were still relevant and which were
 
02:22:06.710 --> 02:22:06.720 align:start position:0%
uh were no longer needed in state law
 
02:22:10.830 --> 02:22:10.840 align:start position:0%
and uh so I'm going to give you a uh
 
02:22:13.830 --> 02:22:13.840 align:start position:0%
just a quick sense of uh what some of
 
02:22:15.910 --> 02:22:15.920 align:start position:0%
the things in chapter
 
02:22:22.349 --> 02:22:22.359 align:start position:0%
434 were that we uh discussed and uh and
 
02:22:25.389 --> 02:22:25.399 align:start position:0%
what we decided to do with them so um
 
02:22:29.510 --> 02:22:29.520 align:start position:0%
starts out with standard boxes uh so
 
02:22:31.630 --> 02:22:31.640 align:start position:0%
standard boxes are no longer a thing
 
02:22:35.349 --> 02:22:35.359 align:start position:0%
that has any bearing in the way that um
 
02:22:38.870 --> 02:22:38.880 align:start position:0%
produce is handled in the state so uh we
 
02:22:41.389 --> 02:22:41.399 align:start position:0%
don't need to have an exact definition
 
02:22:45.590 --> 02:22:45.600 align:start position:0%
of a standard box con containing
 
02:22:51.349 --> 02:22:51.359 align:start position:0%
21628 n cubic inches uh so um we chose
 
02:22:55.309 --> 02:22:55.319 align:start position:0%
to uh delete that part of the law
 
02:22:58.830 --> 02:22:58.840 align:start position:0%
um and then we get on to the laws having
 
02:23:00.590 --> 02:23:00.600 align:start position:0%
to do with ice
 
02:23:04.110 --> 02:23:04.120 align:start position:0%
dealers um and we don't have the ice
 
02:23:07.469 --> 02:23:07.479 align:start position:0%
wagons coming by anymore so uh we
 
02:23:12.150 --> 02:23:12.160 align:start position:0%
decided that was not relevant um and we
 
02:23:14.230 --> 02:23:14.240 align:start position:0%
don't have to worry about any person
 
02:23:17.590 --> 02:23:17.600 align:start position:0%
selling anite coal which might have
 
02:23:21.469 --> 02:23:21.479 align:start position:0%
bones in it uh
 
02:23:25.590 --> 02:23:25.600 align:start position:0%
and uh so that we decided to eliminate
 
02:23:30.469 --> 02:23:30.479 align:start position:0%
um and uh then we get into uh questions
 
02:23:32.230 --> 02:23:32.240 align:start position:0%
having to do with the grating of
 
02:23:34.630 --> 02:23:34.640 align:start position:0%
potatoes that is entirely covered under
 
02:23:37.150 --> 02:23:37.160 align:start position:0%
federal law right now uh and the
 
02:23:39.469 --> 02:23:39.479 align:start position:0%
department does no inspection for that
 
02:23:43.670 --> 02:23:43.680 align:start position:0%
so that uh is being removed from uh in
 
02:23:45.710 --> 02:23:45.720 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
02:23:48.349 --> 02:23:48.359 align:start position:0%
um and
 
02:23:50.630 --> 02:23:50.640 align:start position:0%
uh then we get on
 
02:23:55.269 --> 02:23:55.279 align:start position:0%
to uh the grading of apples and the
 
02:23:57.630 --> 02:23:57.640 align:start position:0%
department still does pay attention to
 
02:24:00.910 --> 02:24:00.920 align:start position:0%
Apple grading uh however there are a lot
 
02:24:03.309 --> 02:24:03.319 align:start position:0%
of details in apple grading that are no
 
02:24:07.550 --> 02:24:07.560 align:start position:0%
longer necessary uh and uh so in the
 
02:24:10.750 --> 02:24:10.760 align:start position:0%
original uh bill that I that you have
 
02:24:14.790 --> 02:24:14.800 align:start position:0%
you were you were handed out uh there is
 
02:24:17.190 --> 02:24:17.200 align:start position:0%
uh still ex extensive information about
 
02:24:19.950 --> 02:24:19.960 align:start position:0%
Apple grading uh in the amendment that I
 
02:24:22.990 --> 02:24:23.000 align:start position:0%
put forward that is pretty much reduced
 
02:24:27.269 --> 02:24:27.279 align:start position:0%
to one sentence that says that the um
 
02:24:29.150 --> 02:24:29.160 align:start position:0%
the standards that that the state
 
02:24:31.030 --> 02:24:31.040 align:start position:0%
standards will be equal to the federal
 
02:24:34.110 --> 02:24:34.120 align:start position:0%
standards because when the state does
 
02:24:36.830 --> 02:24:36.840 align:start position:0%
inspections of apples it is you it is
 
02:24:39.110 --> 02:24:39.120 align:start position:0%
already using those Federal standards
 
02:24:43.030 --> 02:24:43.040 align:start position:0%
and uh so um we are just that will just
 
02:24:45.590 --> 02:24:45.600 align:start position:0%
catch us up with current practice uh
 
02:24:47.710 --> 02:24:47.720 align:start position:0%
there is a whole section on Apple
 
02:24:52.070 --> 02:24:52.080 align:start position:0%
marketing which is uh once again Falls
 
02:24:54.790 --> 02:24:54.800 align:start position:0%
entirely under the purview of the USDA
 
02:24:57.910 --> 02:24:57.920 align:start position:0%
at this point uh so anything having to
 
02:25:00.550 --> 02:25:00.560 align:start position:0%
do with apple marketing is once again
 
02:25:04.510 --> 02:25:04.520 align:start position:0%
something that we follow federal law on
 
02:25:11.110 --> 02:25:11.120 align:start position:0%
um and uh that gets us down to
 
02:25:15.910 --> 02:25:15.920 align:start position:0%
um the uh manufacturing sale of cider
 
02:25:19.030 --> 02:25:19.040 align:start position:0%
and uh that we actually do have
 
02:25:23.950 --> 02:25:23.960 align:start position:0%
inspection of still and uh but we have
 
02:25:26.710 --> 02:25:26.720 align:start position:0%
once we get down to cider uh so Apple
 
02:25:29.230 --> 02:25:29.240 align:start position:0%
once we get down to apple cider and
 
02:25:32.190 --> 02:25:32.200 align:start position:0%
Timber uh everything else in 434 has
 
02:25:34.429 --> 02:25:34.439 align:start position:0%
been eliminated so rather than keeping
 
02:25:37.389 --> 02:25:37.399 align:start position:0%
434 on the books with a few orphans in
 
02:25:40.110 --> 02:25:40.120 align:start position:0%
it we decided to move everything to
 
02:25:44.510 --> 02:25:44.520 align:start position:0%
426 so um so every so in
 
02:25:48.830 --> 02:25:48.840 align:start position:0%
426 uh in the in the bill in 426 we'll
 
02:25:51.469 --> 02:25:51.479 align:start position:0%
we'll have the information on uh
 
02:25:54.550 --> 02:25:54.560 align:start position:0%
matching USDA standards for apples we'll
 
02:25:57.110 --> 02:25:57.120 align:start position:0%
have the existing language uh that we
 
02:25:58.870 --> 02:25:58.880 align:start position:0%
have in the state for cider and we'll
 
02:26:00.469 --> 02:26:00.479 align:start position:0%
have the existing language we have in
 
02:26:03.389 --> 02:26:03.399 align:start position:0%
the state for Timber Harvest for Timber
 
02:26:06.469 --> 02:26:06.479 align:start position:0%
grading uh so that is uh what happens
 
02:26:06.479 --> 02:26:07.550 align:start position:0%
grading uh so that is uh what happens
with

02:26:07.550 --> 02:26:07.560 align:start position:0%
with
 
02:26:10.389 --> 02:26:10.399 align:start position:0%
434 um and in
 
02:26:14.710 --> 02:26:14.720 align:start position:0%
426 uh we went through and we found
 
02:26:16.910 --> 02:26:16.920 align:start position:0%
fewer items that needed to be removed
 
02:26:21.349 --> 02:26:21.359 align:start position:0%
but if on your um Bill sheet you go
 
02:26:25.910 --> 02:26:25.920 align:start position:0%
to um let's see uh section three on page
 
02:26:28.950 --> 02:26:28.960 align:start position:0%
which is on page three starting at line
 
02:26:31.469 --> 02:26:31.479 align:start position:0%
32 um are you talking about the
 
02:26:33.550 --> 02:26:33.560 align:start position:0%
Amendments on this is this is the
 
02:26:34.950 --> 02:26:34.960 align:start position:0%
passation on the amendment on the
 
02:26:37.429 --> 02:26:37.439 align:start position:0%
amendment okay thank you um and the am
 
02:26:39.790 --> 02:26:39.800 align:start position:0%
the amendment replaces the bill okay um
 
02:26:42.710 --> 02:26:42.720 align:start position:0%
I should have mentioned that so um we
 
02:26:46.790 --> 02:26:46.800 align:start position:0%
went through and uh we determined that
 
02:26:49.510 --> 02:26:49.520 align:start position:0%
the definition of organic is done is
 
02:26:51.349 --> 02:26:51.359 align:start position:0%
done federally so that didn't need to
 
02:26:56.389 --> 02:26:56.399 align:start position:0%
stay here uh the similarly the labeling
 
02:27:00.030 --> 02:27:00.040 align:start position:0%
and advertising of organic um and we
 
02:27:03.910 --> 02:27:03.920 align:start position:0%
removed two aspects of uh certif Organic
 
02:27:05.910 --> 02:27:05.920 align:start position:0%
certification because there were things
 
02:27:08.070 --> 02:27:08.080 align:start position:0%
that the department long no longer did
 
02:27:11.710 --> 02:27:11.720 align:start position:0%
there remains in statute one section on
 
02:27:13.870 --> 02:27:13.880 align:start position:0%
uh Organic certification which is for
 
02:27:17.190 --> 02:27:17.200 align:start position:0%
the certification of crops and um that
 
02:27:21.429 --> 02:27:21.439 align:start position:0%
needs to remain in place uh for now uh
 
02:27:26.110 --> 02:27:26.120 align:start position:0%
so after we uh a after the organic bill
 
02:27:28.030 --> 02:27:28.040 align:start position:0%
that I proposed and we heard on the
 
02:27:32.510 --> 02:27:32.520 align:start position:0%
floor last week uh did not pass uh there
 
02:27:34.429 --> 02:27:34.439 align:start position:0%
was new information that came to the
 
02:27:36.030 --> 02:27:36.040 align:start position:0%
department that they were losing one of
 
02:27:37.910 --> 02:27:37.920 align:start position:0%
their inspectors which would have
 
02:27:42.150 --> 02:27:42.160 align:start position:0%
reduced them to two inspectors and uh
 
02:27:46.950 --> 02:27:46.960 align:start position:0%
the the commissioner felt that uh if one
 
02:27:49.670 --> 02:27:49.680 align:start position:0%
of the if one additional inspector were
 
02:27:53.269 --> 02:27:53.279 align:start position:0%
to leave for some reason uh uh whether a
 
02:27:55.790 --> 02:27:55.800 align:start position:0%
health reason or uh you know family
 
02:27:59.349 --> 02:27:59.359 align:start position:0%
reasons or whatever uh that uh the
 
02:28:01.230 --> 02:28:01.240 align:start position:0%
department would be in the in the
 
02:28:03.269 --> 02:28:03.279 align:start position:0%
position of not being able to fil
 
02:28:06.590 --> 02:28:06.600 align:start position:0%
fulfill National Organics program
 
02:28:09.349 --> 02:28:09.359 align:start position:0%
requirements and that the department
 
02:28:11.830 --> 02:28:11.840 align:start position:0%
would not be able to legally
 
02:28:15.230 --> 02:28:15.240 align:start position:0%
certify um Carry Out certification
 
02:28:17.870 --> 02:28:17.880 align:start position:0%
duties and
 
02:28:21.950 --> 02:28:21.960 align:start position:0%
the so the commissioner felt that it was
 
02:28:25.670 --> 02:28:25.680 align:start position:0%
a it was better to
 
02:28:28.910 --> 02:28:28.920 align:start position:0%
uh to uh get people to move to
 
02:28:31.830 --> 02:28:31.840 align:start position:0%
Alternative certifiers in the region uh
 
02:28:34.030 --> 02:28:34.040 align:start position:0%
now before the growing season begins
 
02:28:35.950 --> 02:28:35.960 align:start position:0%
rather than have the risk of people
 
02:28:38.110 --> 02:28:38.120 align:start position:0%
being partway through the season and
 
02:28:40.830 --> 02:28:40.840 align:start position:0%
having to and and having that suddenly
 
02:28:45.910 --> 02:28:45.920 align:start position:0%
taken away uh so uh at this point the
 
02:28:48.150 --> 02:28:48.160 align:start position:0%
department need needs the that
 
02:28:51.190 --> 02:28:51.200 align:start position:0%
existing uh the existing Authority that
 
02:28:53.750 --> 02:28:53.760 align:start position:0%
has to run the Organic certification
 
02:28:56.190 --> 02:28:56.200 align:start position:0%
program until it completes winding down
 
02:29:02.110 --> 02:29:02.120 align:start position:0%
the program uh but uh the um uh but that
 
02:29:03.710 --> 02:29:03.720 align:start position:0%
so that is not something that this bill
 
02:29:09.830 --> 02:29:09.840 align:start position:0%
is removing um and uh the bill also so
 
02:29:12.830 --> 02:29:12.840 align:start position:0%
the uh regulatory Services promotional
 
02:29:16.190 --> 02:29:16.200 align:start position:0%
products fund was a dedicated fund that
 
02:29:19.190 --> 02:29:19.200 align:start position:0%
typically had under $1,000 in it and it
 
02:29:22.510 --> 02:29:22.520 align:start position:0%
would be used to deposit the receipts
 
02:29:27.030 --> 02:29:27.040 align:start position:0%
from selling uh uh Department of
 
02:29:28.790 --> 02:29:28.800 align:start position:0%
Agriculture you uh Department of
 
02:29:31.309 --> 02:29:31.319 align:start position:0%
Agriculture markets and Foods labels and
 
02:29:35.590 --> 02:29:35.600 align:start position:0%
signs to Farmers uh for their promotions
 
02:29:38.630 --> 02:29:38.640 align:start position:0%
and uh it would also pay for the
 
02:29:41.349 --> 02:29:41.359 align:start position:0%
production of those and it was It was
 
02:29:44.070 --> 02:29:44.080 align:start position:0%
decided uh in cons consultation with the
 
02:29:45.750 --> 02:29:45.760 align:start position:0%
Department that it' be much more
 
02:29:47.230 --> 02:29:47.240 align:start position:0%
efficient to just have that run through
 
02:29:49.590 --> 02:29:49.600 align:start position:0%
the general fund because we're talking a
 
02:29:53.309 --> 02:29:53.319 align:start position:0%
very small dollar amount
 
02:29:53.319 --> 02:29:55.670 align:start position:0%
very small dollar amount
um

02:29:55.670 --> 02:29:55.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:29:55.680 --> 02:29:58.550 align:start position:0%
um
and

02:29:58.550 --> 02:29:58.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:30:00.950 --> 02:30:00.960 align:start position:0%
uh and that's pretty much what the bill
 
02:30:05.110 --> 02:30:05.120 align:start position:0%
does so the oh no sorry there's there's
 
02:30:08.750 --> 02:30:08.760 align:start position:0%
more on page four um so the organic
 
02:30:11.030 --> 02:30:11.040 align:start position:0%
processor processor Handler
 
02:30:13.670 --> 02:30:13.680 align:start position:0%
certification fund that is a program
 
02:30:15.269 --> 02:30:15.279 align:start position:0%
that the department not does not do
 
02:30:18.870 --> 02:30:18.880 align:start position:0%
anymore and and that's being eliminated
 
02:30:24.070 --> 02:30:24.080 align:start position:0%
uh and um then we and uh similarly the
 
02:30:28.030 --> 02:30:28.040 align:start position:0%
the fees that are in 426 8A were fees
 
02:30:31.190 --> 02:30:31.200 align:start position:0%
that were uh for a program that is no
 
02:30:35.990 --> 02:30:36.000 align:start position:0%
longer um no longer being done uh and
 
02:30:39.230 --> 02:30:39.240 align:start position:0%
then uh all the other deletions are for
 
02:30:42.309 --> 02:30:42.319 align:start position:0%
434 uh which we've already discussed ex
 
02:30:44.110 --> 02:30:44.120 align:start position:0%
well actually there are a couple in 612
 
02:30:45.870 --> 02:30:45.880 align:start position:0%
which has to do with the dedicated fund
 
02:30:45.880 --> 02:30:47.389 align:start position:0%
which has to do with the dedicated fund
repeals

02:30:47.389 --> 02:30:47.399 align:start position:0%
repeals
 
02:30:50.590 --> 02:30:50.600 align:start position:0%
so that is the sum total of the bill it
 
02:30:53.870 --> 02:30:53.880 align:start position:0%
is uh really a classic housekeeping bill
 
02:30:56.910 --> 02:30:56.920 align:start position:0%
I think that will uh we have REM it will
 
02:31:01.190 --> 02:31:01.200 align:start position:0%
remove a number of nonuseful statutes uh
 
02:31:03.150 --> 02:31:03.160 align:start position:0%
and clarify what
 
02:31:05.110 --> 02:31:05.120 align:start position:0%
remains and I'd be happy to take
 
02:31:07.429 --> 02:31:07.439 align:start position:0%
questions thank you representa Bixby and
 
02:31:09.670 --> 02:31:09.680 align:start position:0%
thank you for your work on this this is
 
02:31:14.190 --> 02:31:14.200 align:start position:0%
um very very good to have um combined
 
02:31:17.990 --> 02:31:18.000 align:start position:0%
some things uh taken out um things that
 
02:31:21.230 --> 02:31:21.240 align:start position:0%
are Antiquated no longer used or
 
02:31:23.710 --> 02:31:23.720 align:start position:0%
whatever but um could you talk a little
 
02:31:27.670 --> 02:31:27.680 align:start position:0%
bit about um the Rel are you repealing a
 
02:31:29.750 --> 02:31:29.760 align:start position:0%
section relative to Lumber
 
02:31:32.550 --> 02:31:32.560 align:start position:0%
standards oh yes so um talk about the
 
02:31:36.469 --> 02:31:36.479 align:start position:0%
lumber piece yes so uh so that is a that
 
02:31:39.389 --> 02:31:39.399 align:start position:0%
is just a that's a mechanical process so
 
02:31:42.550 --> 02:31:42.560 align:start position:0%
we're repealing it in 434 and uh and
 
02:31:45.990 --> 02:31:46.000 align:start position:0%
instating it in 426 oh I got it see yeah
 
02:31:47.269 --> 02:31:47.279 align:start position:0%
and the same thing with the apples and
 
02:31:47.279 --> 02:31:47.990 align:start position:0%
and the same thing with the apples and
The

02:31:47.990 --> 02:31:48.000 align:start position:0%
The
 
02:31:48.000 --> 02:31:50.030 align:start position:0%
The
Cider

02:31:50.030 --> 02:31:50.040 align:start position:0%
Cider
 
02:31:52.269 --> 02:31:52.279 align:start position:0%
okay all right any other questions
 
02:31:54.910 --> 02:31:54.920 align:start position:0%
representative kraton is a simple
 
02:31:57.630 --> 02:31:57.640 align:start position:0%
question and and I and I will say that
 
02:31:59.590 --> 02:31:59.600 align:start position:0%
this was the most fun that I've ever had
 
02:32:01.830 --> 02:32:01.840 align:start position:0%
at the House of Representatives it was
 
02:32:05.309 --> 02:32:05.319 align:start position:0%
it was equivalent to watching paint dry
 
02:32:09.670 --> 02:32:09.680 align:start position:0%
um but I I was wondering if you use this
 
02:32:11.349 --> 02:32:11.359 align:start position:0%
on your campaign
 
02:32:14.790 --> 02:32:14.800 align:start position:0%
speech as something no this is actually
 
02:32:18.269 --> 02:32:18.279 align:start position:0%
a serious question because
 
02:32:20.590 --> 02:32:20.600 align:start position:0%
people say you know what do you do and
 
02:32:22.070 --> 02:32:22.080 align:start position:0%
the fact that it matters we got to rinse
 
02:32:24.710 --> 02:32:24.720 align:start position:0%
a bunch of crazy stuff that you know
 
02:32:27.389 --> 02:32:27.399 align:start position:0%
that that actually you know I I I just
 
02:32:28.990 --> 02:32:29.000 align:start position:0%
want to applaud you for one bringing
 
02:32:31.349 --> 02:32:31.359 align:start position:0%
this up two for doing the heavy lifting
 
02:32:33.190 --> 02:32:33.200 align:start position:0%
on making it happen and three for
 
02:32:35.630 --> 02:32:35.640 align:start position:0%
bringing me along because I I think you
 
02:32:37.550 --> 02:32:37.560 align:start position:0%
know we did eliminate some trees that
 
02:32:39.910 --> 02:32:39.920 align:start position:0%
are being cut every day and and I think
 
02:32:41.870 --> 02:32:41.880 align:start position:0%
it's it's a lot of good work thank you
 
02:32:45.389 --> 02:32:45.399 align:start position:0%
oh thank you and I I I think that um to
 
02:32:47.590 --> 02:32:47.600 align:start position:0%
to follow through on representative
 
02:32:50.550 --> 02:32:50.560 align:start position:0%
kraton's point I think that this is this
 
02:32:52.670 --> 02:32:52.680 align:start position:0%
is I think the third study committee
 
02:32:55.550 --> 02:32:55.560 align:start position:0%
I've done that deals with just doing a
 
02:32:58.790 --> 02:32:58.800 align:start position:0%
deep dive on an existing chapter of Law
 
02:33:01.269 --> 02:33:01.279 align:start position:0%
and figuring out what's current and what
 
02:33:04.870 --> 02:33:04.880 align:start position:0%
needs to be fixed and uh I think that it
 
02:33:04.880 --> 02:33:05.670 align:start position:0%
needs to be fixed and uh I think that it
has

02:33:05.670 --> 02:33:05.680 align:start position:0%
has
 
02:33:09.429 --> 02:33:09.439 align:start position:0%
been um very valuable uh and I I think
 
02:33:11.349 --> 02:33:11.359 align:start position:0%
this is a process we should I think it
 
02:33:13.910 --> 02:33:13.920 align:start position:0%
makes sense to just pick one or two
 
02:33:17.070 --> 02:33:17.080 align:start position:0%
chapters each term and go through them
 
02:33:21.790 --> 02:33:21.800 align:start position:0%
and uh and update them uh so thank you
 
02:33:23.950 --> 02:33:23.960 align:start position:0%
representative ktoa thank you madam
 
02:33:25.950 --> 02:33:25.960 align:start position:0%

uh having served with you on one of
 
02:33:33.110 --> 02:33:33.120 align:start position:0%
these um committees the study committees
 
02:33:35.870 --> 02:33:35.880 align:start position:0%
I think I agree with you that they're
 
02:33:37.910 --> 02:33:37.920 align:start position:0%
extremely valuable and that this
 
02:33:39.870 --> 02:33:39.880 align:start position:0%
committee should be doing a deep dive
 
02:33:42.710 --> 02:33:42.720 align:start position:0%
and picking our essays to go through so
 
02:33:47.269 --> 02:33:47.279 align:start position:0%

does it change the part about
 
02:35:26.349 --> 02:35:26.359 align:start position:0%
advertising does it change the part
 
02:35:29.269 --> 02:35:29.279 align:start position:0%
about advertising did anyone notice that
 
02:35:33.590 --> 02:35:33.600 align:start position:0%
advertising for apples yes it removes it
 
02:35:36.030 --> 02:35:36.040 align:start position:0%
okay then You' you've done what I wanted
 
02:35:39.750 --> 02:35:39.760 align:start position:0%
oh all right um yeah just to uh clue you
 
02:35:41.750 --> 02:35:41.760 align:start position:0%
guys in I never thought I'd be before
 
02:35:43.269 --> 02:35:43.279 align:start position:0%
the environment and agriculture
 
02:35:45.790 --> 02:35:45.800 align:start position:0%
committee um the reason I'm here is for
 
02:35:47.590 --> 02:35:47.600 align:start position:0%
the the New Hampshire press Association
 
02:35:50.630 --> 02:35:50.640 align:start position:0%
because uh we noticed that it the
 
02:35:52.710 --> 02:35:52.720 align:start position:0%
original version of The Bill had uh
 
02:35:54.990 --> 02:35:55.000 align:start position:0%
stipulations regarding uh legal
 
02:35:57.990 --> 02:35:58.000 align:start position:0%
advertising for apples um and I hate to
 
02:36:00.429 --> 02:36:00.439 align:start position:0%
compare apples to uh political
 
02:36:02.750 --> 02:36:02.760 align:start position:0%
advertising but the attorney general has
 
02:36:05.830 --> 02:36:05.840 align:start position:0%
made me do it because last year he
 
02:36:08.309 --> 02:36:08.319 align:start position:0%
arrested one of our Publishers for
 
02:36:10.230 --> 02:36:10.240 align:start position:0%
publishing political advertising that
 
02:36:11.910 --> 02:36:11.920 align:start position:0%
didn't meet the strict definition in the
 
02:36:14.590 --> 02:36:14.600 align:start position:0%
law for political advertising arrested
 
02:36:16.510 --> 02:36:16.520 align:start position:0%
her had her charge
 
02:36:20.870 --> 02:36:20.880 align:start position:0%
and she was found guilty um so I would
 
02:36:22.349 --> 02:36:22.359 align:start position:0%
caution you when you're looking at any
 
02:36:24.870 --> 02:36:24.880 align:start position:0%
bills to make sure that if you put in
 
02:36:26.990 --> 02:36:27.000 align:start position:0%
advertising you specify who's
 
02:36:29.070 --> 02:36:29.080 align:start position:0%
responsible for that and that it's not
 
02:36:31.510 --> 02:36:31.520 align:start position:0%
the guy who prints the flyers or Paints
 
02:36:34.349 --> 02:36:34.359 align:start position:0%
the billboard or publishes the newspaper
 
02:36:35.950 --> 02:36:35.960 align:start position:0%
um that it's actually the person who
 
02:36:38.590 --> 02:36:38.600 align:start position:0%
should know their business and not the
 
02:36:40.990 --> 02:36:41.000 align:start position:0%
person who's just publishing the
 
02:36:44.870 --> 02:36:44.880 align:start position:0%
thing okay so I appreciate the amendment
 
02:36:47.429 --> 02:36:47.439 align:start position:0%
and that's that's all I have open any
 
02:36:49.870 --> 02:36:49.880 align:start position:0%

can introduce it from here you don't
have

04:12:35.189 --> 04:12:35.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:44.309 --> 04:12:44.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:46.990 --> 04:12:47.000 align:start position:0%
yeah do that yeah because we're gonna
 
04:12:49.670 --> 04:12:49.680 align:start position:0%
kill it yeah just that'd be fine if you
 
04:12:52.630 --> 04:12:52.640 align:start position:0%
don't mind just makes it
 
04:12:52.640 --> 04:12:58.790 align:start position:0%
don't mind just makes it
easier

04:12:58.790 --> 04:12:58.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:00.630 --> 04:13:00.640 align:start position:0%
1578 we got
 
04:13:06.149 --> 04:13:06.159 align:start position:0%

right so okay
 
04:13:26.469 --> 04:13:26.479 align:start position:0%
let's go with this here I'm going to
 
04:13:30.990 --> 04:13:31.000 align:start position:0%
open up the hearing for HB
 
04:13:34.269 --> 04:13:34.279 align:start position:0%
1578 and the prime sponsor said he was
 
04:13:35.750 --> 04:13:35.760 align:start position:0%
not going to be here to introduce the
 
04:13:38.790 --> 04:13:38.800 align:start position:0%
bill so representative Bixby has been so
 
04:13:41.710 --> 04:13:41.720 align:start position:0%
kind as to take over that function all
 
04:13:44.990 --> 04:13:45.000 align:start position:0%
right so um for the this representative
 
04:13:49.590 --> 04:13:49.600 align:start position:0%
Bixby uh straford 13 do uh I am going to
 
04:13:51.990 --> 04:13:52.000 align:start position:0%
open up HB
 
04:13:56.710 --> 04:13:56.720 align:start position:0%
1578 uh and uh I don't know that I need
 
04:13:57.820 --> 04:13:57.830 align:start position:0%
to do anything
 
04:13:57.830 --> 04:14:01.469 align:start position:0%
to do anything
[Laughter]

04:14:01.469 --> 04:14:01.479 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
04:14:03.830 --> 04:14:03.840 align:start position:0%
else oh this this bill is about
 
04:14:05.830 --> 04:14:05.840 align:start position:0%
repealing the Organic certific
 
04:14:07.910 --> 04:14:07.920 align:start position:0%
certification program
 
04:14:11.149 --> 04:14:11.159 align:start position:0%
and um I think we're going to have a
 
04:14:12.990 --> 04:14:13.000 align:start position:0%
discussion about this but um as I
 
04:14:15.109 --> 04:14:15.119 align:start position:0%
pointed out this morning the program is
 
04:14:18.670 --> 04:14:18.680 align:start position:0%
essentially uh dead now the bill we ex
 
04:14:20.670 --> 04:14:20.680 align:start position:0%
that we heard this
 
04:14:24.389 --> 04:14:24.399 align:start position:0%
morning uh covers almost everything that
 
04:14:28.870 --> 04:14:28.880 align:start position:0%
1578 would do there is one line in 1578
 
04:14:30.910 --> 04:14:30.920 align:start position:0%
that is absolutely necessary for the
 
04:14:34.950 --> 04:14:34.960 align:start position:0%
current ongoing um uh operations for the
 
04:14:39.510 --> 04:14:39.520 align:start position:0%
department and one line which which uh
 
04:14:42.550 --> 04:14:42.560 align:start position:0%
uh authorize the department if they uh
 
04:14:46.910 --> 04:14:46.920 align:start position:0%
with a as a May um under under a may may
 
04:14:49.510 --> 04:14:49.520 align:start position:0%
have may do Organic certification under
 
04:14:49.520 --> 04:14:50.349 align:start position:0%
have may do Organic certification under
under

04:14:50.349 --> 04:14:50.359 align:start position:0%
under
 
04:14:55.149 --> 04:14:55.159 align:start position:0%
USDA and um that um probably makes sense
 
04:14:57.109 --> 04:14:57.119 align:start position:0%
to leave in place until the program is
 
04:15:01.349 --> 04:15:01.359 align:start position:0%
entirely wound down okay so um that's
 
04:15:02.910 --> 04:15:02.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for introducing the bill for
 
04:15:05.870 --> 04:15:05.880 align:start position:0%
representative Bailey appreciate it and
 
04:15:08.309 --> 04:15:08.319 align:start position:0%
so I will call uh Sean Jasper
 
04:15:09.910 --> 04:15:09.920 align:start position:0%
Commissioner of Department of
 
04:15:18.830 --> 04:15:18.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:22.830 --> 04:15:22.840 align:start position:0%
go first of all I apologize put your
 
04:15:24.750 --> 04:15:24.760 align:start position:0%
microphone on please I was looking at
 
04:15:26.630 --> 04:15:26.640 align:start position:0%
the white light thought it was yeah I
 
04:15:28.870 --> 04:15:28.880 align:start position:0%
should know better by now shouldn't I I
 
04:15:31.229 --> 04:15:31.239 align:start position:0%
wanted to apologize to to the committee
 
04:15:33.910 --> 04:15:33.920 align:start position:0%
for both side to both sides of of the
 
04:15:36.349 --> 04:15:36.359 align:start position:0%
debate on um the funding and I
 
04:15:38.309 --> 04:15:38.319 align:start position:0%
appreciate all the effort that that went
 
04:15:43.710 --> 04:15:43.720 align:start position:0%
into that and um I should have informed
 
04:15:45.710 --> 04:15:45.720 align:start position:0%
the committee beforehand and it was
 
04:15:49.309 --> 04:15:49.319 align:start position:0%
really just the the day before that I
 
04:15:51.910 --> 04:15:51.920 align:start position:0%
had come to the conclusion that if in
 
04:15:54.990 --> 04:15:55.000 align:start position:0%
fact the bill went down there was no way
 
04:15:57.429 --> 04:15:57.439 align:start position:0%
we could continue the
 
04:16:00.070 --> 04:16:00.080 align:start position:0%
program and that was due to staffing
 
04:16:02.389 --> 04:16:02.399 align:start position:0%
issues I'd always said that as long as
 
04:16:05.910 --> 04:16:05.920 align:start position:0%
we had three people who um were
 
04:16:09.349 --> 04:16:09.359 align:start position:0%
certified we could continue through 2024
 
04:16:11.910 --> 04:16:11.920 align:start position:0%
and unfortunately that option was taken
 
04:16:14.469 --> 04:16:14.479 align:start position:0%
away the bill had passed I'm still not
 
04:16:17.550 --> 04:16:17.560 align:start position:0%
sure exactly what I would have done
 
04:16:19.309 --> 04:16:19.319 align:start position:0%
because we still wouldn't have had
 
04:16:22.389 --> 04:16:22.399 align:start position:0%
probably people in time but I should
 
04:16:25.510 --> 04:16:25.520 align:start position:0%
have uh informed the committee that I
 
04:16:27.229 --> 04:16:27.239 align:start position:0%
had made that decision and I have to
 
04:16:30.149 --> 04:16:30.159 align:start position:0%
apologize to you things were moving
 
04:16:33.670 --> 04:16:33.680 align:start position:0%
rather rapidly and it just it I didn't
 
04:16:36.349 --> 04:16:36.359 align:start position:0%
even think of it at that time and when I
 
04:16:39.030 --> 04:16:39.040 align:start position:0%
had a conversation with the with the
 
04:16:41.750 --> 04:16:41.760 align:start position:0%
chairman I realized that I had certainly
 
04:16:44.990 --> 04:16:45.000 align:start position:0%
made a an error which I regret I pride
 
04:16:47.030 --> 04:16:47.040 align:start position:0%
myself on Communications and trying to
 
04:16:49.510 --> 04:16:49.520 align:start position:0%
be transparent with what's going on and
 
04:16:52.550 --> 04:16:52.560 align:start position:0%
I failed miserably and so I apologized
 
04:16:54.670 --> 04:16:54.680 align:start position:0%
to the committee for that
 
04:16:59.550 --> 04:16:59.560 align:start position:0%
failure um I was coming in support of
 
04:16:59.560 --> 04:17:00.229 align:start position:0%
failure um I was coming in support of
the

04:17:00.229 --> 04:17:00.239 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:17:03.429 --> 04:17:03.439 align:start position:0%
repeal uh understand exactly what uh
 
04:17:06.630 --> 04:17:06.640 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby has said and um
 
04:17:09.429 --> 04:17:09.439 align:start position:0%
that one line can be dealt with in in
 
04:17:13.830 --> 04:17:13.840 align:start position:0%
the future uh but the the part of um
 
04:17:16.189 --> 04:17:16.199 align:start position:0%
rulle making whatever happens needs to
 
04:17:17.950 --> 04:17:17.960 align:start position:0%
stay in the bill because that actually
 
04:17:21.309 --> 04:17:21.319 align:start position:0%
affects um other other rules that are
 
04:17:22.510 --> 04:17:22.520 align:start position:0%
currently in place that don't have
 
04:17:24.870 --> 04:17:24.880 align:start position:0%
anything to do with Organic but they do
 
04:17:27.830 --> 04:17:27.840 align:start position:0%
reference that section so I'd be glad to
 
04:17:31.950 --> 04:17:31.960 align:start position:0%
take any uh slings arrows or
 
04:17:35.590 --> 04:17:35.600 align:start position:0%
questions thank you
 
04:17:37.070 --> 04:17:37.080 align:start position:0%
commissioner thank thank you
 
04:17:39.469 --> 04:17:39.479 align:start position:0%
commissioner I really appreciate um your
 
04:17:41.830 --> 04:17:41.840 align:start position:0%
words and I appreciate your forthcoming
 
04:17:46.910 --> 04:17:46.920 align:start position:0%
this um apology accepted thank you and
 
04:17:49.830 --> 04:17:49.840 align:start position:0%
um thank you for coming and speaking on
 
04:17:52.109 --> 04:17:52.119 align:start position:0%
this bill representative NAB thank you
 
04:17:53.349 --> 04:17:53.359 align:start position:0%
madam chair thank you for taking my
 
04:17:54.990 --> 04:17:55.000 align:start position:0%
question is there any benefit to leaving
 
04:17:57.750 --> 04:17:57.760 align:start position:0%
this in statute even if it's dormant or
 
04:18:01.109 --> 04:18:01.119 align:start position:0%
not currently funded I I don't think
 
04:18:03.030 --> 04:18:03.040 align:start position:0%
there is I mean my preference would have
 
04:18:04.950 --> 04:18:04.960 align:start position:0%
been that it just come out as of July
 
04:18:07.670 --> 04:18:07.680 align:start position:0%
1st when our program will end
 
04:18:10.189 --> 04:18:10.199 align:start position:0%
um but you know this is sort of like
 
04:18:13.070 --> 04:18:13.080 align:start position:0%
what's going on with the the state meat
 
04:18:15.269 --> 04:18:15.279 align:start position:0%
program that's on the books if you've
 
04:18:16.910 --> 04:18:16.920 align:start position:0%
got something on statute people are
 
04:18:18.189 --> 04:18:18.199 align:start position:0%
always saying why aren't you doing this
 
04:18:21.149 --> 04:18:21.159 align:start position:0%
why aren't you doing this you know um
 
04:18:23.269 --> 04:18:23.279 align:start position:0%
and and so it's more
 
04:18:27.030 --> 04:18:27.040 align:start position:0%
of a an annoyance to leave things on the
 
04:18:29.590 --> 04:18:29.600 align:start position:0%
books when they don't have any practical
 
04:18:31.710 --> 04:18:31.720 align:start position:0%
effect and if the state was ever to
 
04:18:34.590 --> 04:18:34.600 align:start position:0%
decide to to get back into that business
 
04:18:36.750 --> 04:18:36.760 align:start position:0%
which I don't think there's going to be
 
04:18:39.750 --> 04:18:39.760 align:start position:0%
the volume to to do that and just to let
 
04:18:43.389 --> 04:18:43.399 align:start position:0%
you know that this last year the number
 
04:18:43.399 --> 04:18:44.429 align:start position:0%
you know that this last year the number
of

04:18:44.429 --> 04:18:44.439 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:18:48.070 --> 04:18:48.080 align:start position:0%
Acres um that we were certifying in the
 
04:18:51.710 --> 04:18:51.720 align:start position:0%
ground um for production outside of
 
04:18:54.830 --> 04:18:54.840 align:start position:0%
pasture land was less than 110
 
04:18:58.429 --> 04:18:58.439 align:start position:0%
acres um and so that was a minuscule
 
04:19:01.229 --> 04:19:01.239 align:start position:0%
number and it's not likely that we'll
 
04:19:04.630 --> 04:19:04.640 align:start position:0%
ever be able to do anything that will um
 
04:19:07.229 --> 04:19:07.239 align:start position:0%
be productive there are plenty out there
 
04:19:09.189 --> 04:19:09.199 align:start position:0%
as you know who are doing it I it's a
 
04:19:12.550 --> 04:19:12.560 align:start position:0%
sad day I am very sorry that it h had to
 
04:19:15.590 --> 04:19:15.600 align:start position:0%
come to this I never you know there are
 
04:19:17.670 --> 04:19:17.680 align:start position:0%
people out there who've said oh this was
 
04:19:19.710 --> 04:19:19.720 align:start position:0%
your your plan since the day you came
 
04:19:22.349 --> 04:19:22.359 align:start position:0%
into office and I say to people when I
 
04:19:23.870 --> 04:19:23.880 align:start position:0%
became commissioner I didn't know a
 
04:19:25.750 --> 04:19:25.760 align:start position:0%
thing about the organic program I didn't
 
04:19:28.870 --> 04:19:28.880 align:start position:0%
know anything really about it until we
 
04:19:31.429 --> 04:19:31.439 align:start position:0%
had to end the processing animal part of
 
04:19:33.910 --> 04:19:33.920 align:start position:0%
it and my first words were no we're not
 
04:19:37.309 --> 04:19:37.319 align:start position:0%
going to end that um because organic
 
04:19:40.189 --> 04:19:40.199 align:start position:0%
farming is very important uh it's a very
 
04:19:42.309 --> 04:19:42.319 align:start position:0%
important part of agriculture in New
 
04:19:44.590 --> 04:19:44.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but for us to be a certifying
 
04:19:46.990 --> 04:19:47.000 align:start position:0%
agent just doesn't make any
 
04:19:49.550 --> 04:19:49.560 align:start position:0%
sense okay thank
 
04:19:52.309 --> 04:19:52.319 align:start position:0%
you all right any other questions
 
04:19:55.030 --> 04:19:55.040 align:start position:0%
represent Bixby this is somewhat
 
04:19:57.469 --> 04:19:57.479 align:start position:0%
tangential but um I understand you've
 
04:20:00.229 --> 04:20:00.239 align:start position:0%
been having some uh you've been opening
 
04:20:02.870 --> 04:20:02.880 align:start position:0%
um communication lines with NOA New
 
04:20:04.269 --> 04:20:04.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and you've been discussing
 
04:20:06.710 --> 04:20:06.720 align:start position:0%
other ways that the department might be
 
04:20:09.750 --> 04:20:09.760 align:start position:0%
able to support organic outside the the
 
04:20:11.670 --> 04:20:11.680 align:start position:0%
certification program is that correct
 
04:20:14.550 --> 04:20:14.560 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Bixby yes we we
 
04:20:16.550 --> 04:20:16.560 align:start position:0%
started the discussions with NOA New
 
04:20:20.630 --> 04:20:20.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire on what we saw um happening
 
04:20:22.870 --> 04:20:22.880 align:start position:0%
back in August of last year and those
 
04:20:25.469 --> 04:20:25.479 align:start position:0%
have been very productive
 
04:20:28.710 --> 04:20:28.720 align:start position:0%
discussions um and unfortunately I think
 
04:20:29.990 --> 04:20:30.000 align:start position:0%
you know even as much as they were
 
04:20:32.469 --> 04:20:32.479 align:start position:0%
looking at being a certifying agent or
 
04:20:35.990 --> 04:20:36.000 align:start position:0%
or some sort of other Arrangement again
 
04:20:39.550 --> 04:20:39.560 align:start position:0%
the scale of things didn't work for them
 
04:20:41.710 --> 04:20:41.720 align:start position:0%
uh but what we've learned in this is
 
04:20:44.469 --> 04:20:44.479 align:start position:0%
that people really want to have that
 
04:20:45.830 --> 04:20:45.840 align:start position:0%
connection to the New Hampshire
 
04:20:48.229 --> 04:20:48.239 align:start position:0%
Department of Agriculture one of the
 
04:20:52.710 --> 04:20:52.720 align:start position:0%
things um that I think we can do um is
 
04:20:55.590 --> 04:20:55.600 align:start position:0%
that we can expand our program in the
 
04:20:58.590 --> 04:20:58.600 align:start position:0%
Seal of quality and probably just based
 
04:21:01.870 --> 04:21:01.880 align:start position:0%
on their certification as organic really
 
04:21:05.349 --> 04:21:05.359 align:start position:0%
just um allow them to use that seal on
 
04:21:07.309 --> 04:21:07.319 align:start position:0%
any of their organic Pro programs it's
 
04:21:09.349 --> 04:21:09.359 align:start position:0%
an underutilized program right now I
 
04:21:11.830 --> 04:21:11.840 align:start position:0%
believe but I think we can can expand it
 
04:21:14.070 --> 04:21:14.080 align:start position:0%
and I'd like to see that happen and as
 
04:21:15.990 --> 04:21:16.000 align:start position:0%
soon as we get some breathing room we
 
04:21:19.830 --> 04:21:19.840 align:start position:0%
will be doing that and um and looking at
 
04:21:23.030 --> 04:21:23.040 align:start position:0%
that but um yeah that's one of the areas
 
04:21:25.070 --> 04:21:25.080 align:start position:0%
that we can look at the other thing is
 
04:21:28.590 --> 04:21:28.600 align:start position:0%
we will be able to provide advice to any
 
04:21:30.910 --> 04:21:30.920 align:start position:0%
organic grower something we can't do now
 
04:21:32.670 --> 04:21:32.680 align:start position:0%
although frankly Cooperative Extension
 
04:21:34.630 --> 04:21:34.640 align:start position:0%
is in a better position to do that
 
04:21:36.830 --> 04:21:36.840 align:start position:0%
because they're the Educators but we we
 
04:21:39.590 --> 04:21:39.600 align:start position:0%
can be more helpful uh moving forward
 
04:21:43.109 --> 04:21:43.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:45.149 --> 04:21:45.159 align:start position:0%
certifier thank you any other questions
 
04:21:47.710 --> 04:21:47.720 align:start position:0%
from the committee seeing none thank you
 
04:21:50.109 --> 04:21:50.119 align:start position:0%
very much commission one more mad could
 
04:21:51.510 --> 04:21:51.520 align:start position:0%
if you would like I could give you a
 
04:21:54.710 --> 04:21:54.720 align:start position:0%
very brief update on the U uh crop
 
04:21:54.720 --> 04:21:55.990 align:start position:0%
very brief update on the U uh crop
relief

04:21:55.990 --> 04:21:56.000 align:start position:0%
relief
 
04:22:00.109 --> 04:22:00.119 align:start position:0%
program um the $8 million that was sure
 
04:22:01.670 --> 04:22:01.680 align:start position:0%
sure it looks like there's not a lot of
 
04:22:04.830 --> 04:22:04.840 align:start position:0%
people sure um just we did open that up
 
04:22:07.910 --> 04:22:07.920 align:start position:0%
last Friday we already had um I think
 
04:22:09.790 --> 04:22:09.800 align:start position:0%
two complete applications when we came
 
04:22:13.630 --> 04:22:13.640 align:start position:0%
in on Monday and we had um three others
 
04:22:15.870 --> 04:22:15.880 align:start position:0%
who had put an application and we're up
 
04:22:19.030 --> 04:22:19.040 align:start position:0%
to um a much higher number now and we
 
04:22:21.750 --> 04:22:21.760 align:start position:0%
may have as many of as five that we are
 
04:22:23.830 --> 04:22:23.840 align:start position:0%
going to be able to go to governor and
 
04:22:27.550 --> 04:22:27.560 align:start position:0%
council with uh next week so the word is
 
04:22:29.510 --> 04:22:29.520 align:start position:0%
getting out there The Cooperative
 
04:22:31.790 --> 04:22:31.800 align:start position:0%
Extension again did a great job and it's
 
04:22:36.630 --> 04:22:36.640 align:start position:0%
an easy to uh navigate process and so
 
04:22:38.590 --> 04:22:38.600 align:start position:0%
I'm looking forward to getting as much
 
04:22:41.070 --> 04:22:41.080 align:start position:0%
money out there to people as possible
 
04:22:42.630 --> 04:22:42.640 align:start position:0%
particularly since it looks like uh
 
04:22:46.269 --> 04:22:46.279 align:start position:0%
we're already in Spring yeah um so I
 
04:22:47.790 --> 04:22:47.800 align:start position:0%
know that Vineyards were hit pretty
 
04:22:50.469 --> 04:22:50.479 align:start position:0%
badly weren't they not yes I mean they
 
04:22:52.389 --> 04:22:52.399 align:start position:0%
they were I haven't talked to too many I
 
04:22:55.309 --> 04:22:55.319 align:start position:0%
know flag hill and in Lee was and you
 
04:22:57.750 --> 04:22:57.760 align:start position:0%
know every every sector of outdoor
 
04:23:00.710 --> 04:23:00.720 align:start position:0%
agriculture was hit hard and every
 
04:23:03.070 --> 04:23:03.080 align:start position:0%
sector of Agriculture uh outdoor
 
04:23:05.630 --> 04:23:05.640 align:start position:0%
agriculture will be eligible for the
 
04:23:08.070 --> 04:23:08.080 align:start position:0%
program this is this more about flooding
 
04:23:10.910 --> 04:23:10.920 align:start position:0%
or Frost no it's it's it's all of the
 
04:23:14.070 --> 04:23:14.080 align:start position:0%
above yeah so it's it's Frost it's
 
04:23:16.670 --> 04:23:16.680 align:start position:0%
flooding drought uh well we didn't have
 
04:23:18.429 --> 04:23:18.439 align:start position:0%
any drought condition we we didn't have
 
04:23:20.630 --> 04:23:20.640 align:start position:0%
a drought yeah uh we certainly didn't
 
04:23:22.030 --> 04:23:22.040 align:start position:0%
have any drought this year but we did
 
04:23:23.790 --> 04:23:23.800 align:start position:0%
have a a number of freeze events and
 
04:23:27.109 --> 04:23:27.119 align:start position:0%
then flooding and just generally very
 
04:23:29.910 --> 04:23:29.920 align:start position:0%
wet conditions so we're going to look at
 
04:23:31.429 --> 04:23:31.439 align:start position:0%
at everything I mean we've even had
 
04:23:34.309 --> 04:23:34.319 align:start position:0%
Maple producers talking to us about poor
 
04:23:36.429 --> 04:23:36.439 align:start position:0%
Maple crop they had particularly in
 
04:23:38.590 --> 04:23:38.600 align:start position:0%
Southern New Hampshire last year because
 
04:23:41.429 --> 04:23:41.439 align:start position:0%
it got so warm so quickly right uh which
 
04:23:44.309 --> 04:23:44.319 align:start position:0%
unfortunately is the same situation
 
04:23:46.710 --> 04:23:46.720 align:start position:0%
we're facing now and keeping our fingers
 
04:23:49.590 --> 04:23:49.600 align:start position:0%
crossed at as warm as it is um we don't
 
04:23:52.630 --> 04:23:52.640 align:start position:0%
get a couple of deep freezes certainly
 
04:23:54.389 --> 04:23:54.399 align:start position:0%
we're by that first one that I think
 
04:23:56.590 --> 04:23:56.600 align:start position:0%
killed all the peaches before they even
 
04:23:58.109 --> 04:23:58.119 align:start position:0%
had an opportunity to come out now we're
 
04:24:00.309 --> 04:24:00.319 align:start position:0%
just worried about are things going to
 
04:24:03.309 --> 04:24:03.319 align:start position:0%
start to to Bud and then get a a killing
 
04:24:05.990 --> 04:24:06.000 align:start position:0%
Frost don't jinx it well I I don't think
 
04:24:08.070 --> 04:24:08.080 align:start position:0%
my words are going to have much impact
 
04:24:10.910 --> 04:24:10.920 align:start position:0%
with with mother nature but I am I'm
 
04:24:13.349 --> 04:24:13.359 align:start position:0%
certainly asking her not to hurt New
 
04:24:16.389 --> 04:24:16.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire agriculture again this year so
 
04:24:18.790 --> 04:24:18.800 align:start position:0%
thank you okay we're confident we're GNA
 
04:24:22.389 --> 04:24:22.399 align:start position:0%
get money out when it matters most all
 
04:24:23.510 --> 04:24:23.520 align:start position:0%
right well thank you and thank you for
 
04:24:26.070 --> 04:24:26.080 align:start position:0%
your efforts appreciate you coming today
 
04:24:35.149 --> 04:24:35.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:35.159 --> 04:24:39.630 align:start position:0%
 
Trumble

04:24:39.630 --> 04:24:39.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:41.189 --> 04:24:41.199 align:start position:0%
thank you Madame chairwoman and
 
04:24:42.670 --> 04:24:42.680 align:start position:0%
committee members my name is David
 
04:24:44.469 --> 04:24:44.479 align:start position:0%
Trumble I'm from Good Earth Farm in the
 
04:24:48.189 --> 04:24:48.199 align:start position:0%
town of wear I uh opposed this bill for
 
04:24:50.189 --> 04:24:50.199 align:start position:0%
a couple reasons uh before I get to that
 
04:24:52.109 --> 04:24:52.119 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to say that as as part of
 
04:24:54.269 --> 04:24:54.279 align:start position:0%
the record of the closing of the state's
 
04:24:56.550 --> 04:24:56.560 align:start position:0%
organic program I think it should be
 
04:24:59.070 --> 04:24:59.080 align:start position:0%
noted of great thanks to the Department
 
04:25:00.710 --> 04:25:00.720 align:start position:0%
of Agriculture in particular the
 
04:25:03.750 --> 04:25:03.760 align:start position:0%
inspectors who traveled throughout this
 
04:25:05.750 --> 04:25:05.760 align:start position:0%
state to every corner over every bumpy
 
04:25:07.790 --> 04:25:07.800 align:start position:0%
road to find the farmers they studied
 
04:25:10.269 --> 04:25:10.279 align:start position:0%
the federal laws which are complex and
 
04:25:12.149 --> 04:25:12.159 align:start position:0%
they made it understandable to the
 
04:25:13.510 --> 04:25:13.520 align:start position:0%
farmers and treated them with a great
 
04:25:14.469 --> 04:25:14.479 align:start position:0%
deal of
 
04:25:17.510 --> 04:25:17.520 align:start position:0%
respect um so the reasons why I oppose
 
04:25:19.189 --> 04:25:19.199 align:start position:0%
this bill first is I think it creates a
 
04:25:21.510 --> 04:25:21.520 align:start position:0%
black hole that could be abused to the
 
04:25:23.269 --> 04:25:23.279 align:start position:0%
detriment of the certified organic
 
04:25:25.750 --> 04:25:25.760 align:start position:0%
farmers in the state even though the
 
04:25:27.510 --> 04:25:27.520 align:start position:0%
state has stopped its certification
 
04:25:29.229 --> 04:25:29.239 align:start position:0%
program this bill would eliminate the
 
04:25:31.109 --> 04:25:31.119 align:start position:0%
requirements that first all crops
 
04:25:33.349 --> 04:25:33.359 align:start position:0%
labeled as organic must meet the federal
 
04:25:35.349 --> 04:25:35.359 align:start position:0%
standards and two that all crops labeled
 
04:25:37.910 --> 04:25:37.920 align:start position:0%
as organic must be certified by a proper
 
04:25:39.950 --> 04:25:39.960 align:start position:0%
agency I certainly don't expect the
 
04:25:41.590 --> 04:25:41.600 align:start position:0%
Department of Agriculture to spend a lot
 
04:25:43.870 --> 04:25:43.880 align:start position:0%
of time enforcing that but it should
 
04:25:46.229 --> 04:25:46.239 align:start position:0%
remain on the books as a law if you're a
 
04:25:48.030 --> 04:25:48.040 align:start position:0%
certified organic farmer in this state
 
04:25:51.189 --> 04:25:51.199 align:start position:0%
and there are 130 at this point between
 
04:25:52.630 --> 04:25:52.640 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire program and those who
 
04:25:55.149 --> 04:25:55.159 align:start position:0%
have had to go elsewhere if somebody
 
04:25:57.870 --> 04:25:57.880 align:start position:0%
else is calling their produce organic
 
04:25:59.910 --> 04:25:59.920 align:start position:0%
there's no recourse if you eliminate
 
04:26:01.469 --> 04:26:01.479 align:start position:0%
this bill from the books and so there
 
04:26:03.870 --> 04:26:03.880 align:start position:0%
should at least remain on the books a
 
04:26:05.469 --> 04:26:05.479 align:start position:0%
law that says if you're calling your
 
04:26:07.790 --> 04:26:07.800 align:start position:0%
produce or organic you have to meet the
 
04:26:11.189 --> 04:26:11.199 align:start position:0%
federal rules and you have to be under a
 
04:26:12.990 --> 04:26:13.000 align:start position:0%
uh organic program also would be
 
04:26:14.710 --> 04:26:14.720 align:start position:0%
detrimental to any consumers who care
 
04:26:16.189 --> 04:26:16.199 align:start position:0%
about this and it's worth remembering
 
04:26:18.349 --> 04:26:18.359 align:start position:0%
when this discussion started last month
 
04:26:20.109 --> 04:26:20.119 align:start position:0%
without a great deal of effort over a
 
04:26:21.790 --> 04:26:21.800 align:start position:0%
thousand people signed the petition to
 
04:26:23.750 --> 04:26:23.760 align:start position:0%
keep the program alive so the consumers
 
04:26:25.710 --> 04:26:25.720 align:start position:0%
are concerned as well and I think it's
 
04:26:27.309 --> 04:26:27.319 align:start position:0%
within the purview of the Department of
 
04:26:30.870 --> 04:26:30.880 align:start position:0%
Agriculture the statute uh 52 something
 
04:26:32.710 --> 04:26:32.720 align:start position:0%
that that sets up the department says
 
04:26:35.109 --> 04:26:35.119 align:start position:0%
its number one purpose is to promote and
 
04:26:37.149 --> 04:26:37.159 align:start position:0%
regulate AG agriculture in all of its
 
04:26:39.309 --> 04:26:39.319 align:start position:0%
branches and also to regulate the
 
04:26:41.189 --> 04:26:41.199 align:start position:0%
quality and grade of agricultural crops
 
04:26:43.189 --> 04:26:43.199 align:start position:0%
so it wouldn't be out of the realm of
 
04:26:44.750 --> 04:26:44.760 align:start position:0%
what the Department of Agriculture is
 
04:26:47.149 --> 04:26:47.159 align:start position:0%
supposed to do just if this is one of
 
04:26:48.469 --> 04:26:48.479 align:start position:0%
those rules that's come along and I
 
04:26:50.070 --> 04:26:50.080 align:start position:0%
think it should remain the other reason
 
04:26:51.630 --> 04:26:51.640 align:start position:0%
is I just wanted to tell a story about
 
04:26:53.349 --> 04:26:53.359 align:start position:0%
the state certified organic farms and
 
04:26:54.990 --> 04:26:55.000 align:start position:0%
their importance to agriculture I'll try
 
04:26:57.189 --> 04:26:57.199 align:start position:0%
to use some numbers to tell that story
 
04:26:58.750 --> 04:26:58.760 align:start position:0%
first of all I think that certified
 
04:27:01.830 --> 04:27:01.840 align:start position:0%
organic farms account for almost 10% of
 
04:27:03.990 --> 04:27:04.000 align:start position:0%
farm sales in the state you wouldn't get
 
04:27:06.750 --> 04:27:06.760 align:start position:0%
that impression if you uh thought well
 
04:27:09.349 --> 04:27:09.359 align:start position:0%
there's only 60 Farms with 100 acres but
 
04:27:13.550 --> 04:27:13.560 align:start position:0%
actually this is from the usda's
 
04:27:16.189 --> 04:27:16.199 align:start position:0%
agricultural census in 2022 New
 
04:27:19.229 --> 04:27:19.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire farms in total do $249 million
 
04:27:21.269 --> 04:27:21.279 align:start position:0%
a business that's all the farms in the
 
04:27:23.870 --> 04:27:23.880 align:start position:0%
state put together USDA also does a
 
04:27:25.750 --> 04:27:25.760 align:start position:0%
separate organic survey and they
 
04:27:28.109 --> 04:27:28.119 align:start position:0%
released this in December of 2022 it was
 
04:27:30.910 --> 04:27:30.920 align:start position:0%
based on the 2021 numbers there were 93
 
04:27:32.750 --> 04:27:32.760 align:start position:0%
certified organic farms that filled out
 
04:27:34.670 --> 04:27:34.680 align:start position:0%
that survey and they did over $17
 
04:27:37.510 --> 04:27:37.520 align:start position:0%
million in sales now NOA there's been a
 
04:27:39.070 --> 04:27:39.080 align:start position:0%
lot of discussion this week with NOA
 
04:27:41.590 --> 04:27:41.600 align:start position:0%
trying to help organic farmers find
 
04:27:44.670 --> 04:27:44.680 align:start position:0%
alternative certifiers and so one of the
 
04:27:46.070 --> 04:27:46.080 align:start position:0%
things that came through in this email
 
04:27:48.550 --> 04:27:48.560 align:start position:0%
was that there's 128 certified organic
 
04:27:50.790 --> 04:27:50.800 align:start position:0%
farms right now in the state 69 out of
 
04:27:53.870 --> 04:27:53.880 align:start position:0%
state 59 inst state so 93 filled out
 
04:27:56.389 --> 04:27:56.399 align:start position:0%
that survey but there's another 35 that
 
04:27:58.469 --> 04:27:58.479 align:start position:0%
didn't fill out that USDA survey if you
 
04:28:01.269 --> 04:28:01.279 align:start position:0%
just do ratios you would get up to $24
 
04:28:03.189 --> 04:28:03.199 align:start position:0%
million in organic sales now maybe it's
 
04:28:05.510 --> 04:28:05.520 align:start position:0%
not 24 million maybe it's only 21 or 22
 
04:28:07.750 --> 04:28:07.760 align:start position:0%
million but it's pretty close to exactly
 
04:28:10.349 --> 04:28:10.359 align:start position:0%
10% of the sales in the state and that's
 
04:28:12.309 --> 04:28:12.319 align:start position:0%
just the certified organic farms if you
 
04:28:14.349 --> 04:28:14.359 align:start position:0%
do less than $5,000 you don't bother
 
04:28:15.990 --> 04:28:16.000 align:start position:0%
getting certified and there's a lot of
 
04:28:18.189 --> 04:28:18.199 align:start position:0%
farmers in the state who just follow the
 
04:28:22.469 --> 04:28:22.479 align:start position:0%
rules but don't get certified anyway so
 
04:28:24.910 --> 04:28:24.920 align:start position:0%
that's about 10% don't forget as well
 
04:28:26.750 --> 04:28:26.760 align:start position:0%
that under the new top program there's
 
04:28:29.590 --> 04:28:29.600 align:start position:0%
20 Farms that are transitioning to
 
04:28:31.710 --> 04:28:31.720 align:start position:0%
organic and they are talking about a
 
04:28:33.630 --> 04:28:33.640 align:start position:0%
second wave of that program because
 
04:28:34.990 --> 04:28:35.000 align:start position:0%
there's in so much interest so there'll
 
04:28:36.309 --> 04:28:36.319 align:start position:0%
be more coming
 
04:28:38.990 --> 04:28:39.000 align:start position:0%
another factor is that organic farms are
 
04:28:41.149 --> 04:28:41.159 align:start position:0%
increasing production in that National
 
04:28:43.429 --> 04:28:43.439 align:start position:0%
survey they ask over the next 5 years do
 
04:28:45.070 --> 04:28:45.080 align:start position:0%
you plan to increase stay the same or
 
04:28:48.469 --> 04:28:48.479 align:start position:0%
decrease only 2% said decrease and 2%
 
04:28:51.389 --> 04:28:51.399 align:start position:0%
said go out of business 29% said
 
04:28:53.389 --> 04:28:53.399 align:start position:0%
increase and the rest said stay the same
 
04:28:54.870 --> 04:28:54.880 align:start position:0%
so in other words for everyone who's
 
04:28:56.710 --> 04:28:56.720 align:start position:0%
thinking of reducing there's seven
 
04:28:59.269 --> 04:28:59.279 align:start position:0%
Organic Farms who wanting to do more the
 
04:29:01.149 --> 04:29:01.159 align:start position:0%
average age of a farmer in this country
 
04:29:03.950 --> 04:29:03.960 align:start position:0%
is like 58 or something and not all of
 
04:29:05.469 --> 04:29:05.479 align:start position:0%
them have a succession plan to somebody
 
04:29:07.750 --> 04:29:07.760 align:start position:0%
in their family organic farmers want to
 
04:29:09.510 --> 04:29:09.520 align:start position:0%
expand so not only will there be more of
 
04:29:11.070 --> 04:29:11.080 align:start position:0%
them but the the ones that are in
 
04:29:12.670 --> 04:29:12.680 align:start position:0%
business right now want to do more so
 
04:29:14.750 --> 04:29:14.760 align:start position:0%
we're easily going to be well over 10%
 
04:29:18.630 --> 04:29:18.640 align:start position:0%
of this state's um sales in agriculture
 
04:29:20.630 --> 04:29:20.640 align:start position:0%
that's a significant amount another way
 
04:29:22.630 --> 04:29:22.640 align:start position:0%
to look at it is like how productive are
 
04:29:24.510 --> 04:29:24.520 align:start position:0%
we per acre do you think organic farms
 
04:29:26.149 --> 04:29:26.159 align:start position:0%
are small farms or big farms it depends
 
04:29:28.550 --> 04:29:28.560 align:start position:0%
on how you look at that but the USDA
 
04:29:30.790 --> 04:29:30.800 align:start position:0%
census said that over half the farms in
 
04:29:32.950 --> 04:29:32.960 align:start position:0%
this state do less than $5,000 worth of
 
04:29:35.950 --> 04:29:35.960 align:start position:0%
business and 2third do less than $10,000
 
04:29:38.189 --> 04:29:38.199 align:start position:0%
for a business so it's pretty much small
 
04:29:41.389 --> 04:29:41.399 align:start position:0%
farms organic farms however under the
 
04:29:45.349 --> 04:29:45.359 align:start position:0%
USDA survey only 24% do less than 10,000
 
04:29:47.389 --> 04:29:47.399 align:start position:0%
so if you look at it like a pizza pie
 
04:29:49.269 --> 04:29:49.279 align:start position:0%
Organic Farms I mean State Farms in
 
04:29:53.030 --> 04:29:53.040 align:start position:0%
general almost 66% of them are less than
 
04:29:55.269 --> 04:29:55.279 align:start position:0%
10,000 but only one in four organic
 
04:29:57.149 --> 04:29:57.159 align:start position:0%
farms are these are serious Farms that
 
04:29:58.910 --> 04:29:58.920 align:start position:0%
do a significant amount of business give
 
04:30:01.229 --> 04:30:01.239 align:start position:0%
you one example in the testimony the
 
04:30:03.630 --> 04:30:03.640 align:start position:0%
commissioner submitted last time his
 
04:30:06.109 --> 04:30:06.119 align:start position:0%
example a median Farm after took out the
 
04:30:07.950 --> 04:30:07.960 align:start position:0%
you know the the extra big farms which
 
04:30:09.990 --> 04:30:10.000 align:start position:0%
would have skewed the numbers was that 3
 
04:30:13.790 --> 04:30:13.800 align:start position:0%
acres of production $60,000 of gross how
 
04:30:16.149 --> 04:30:16.159 align:start position:0%
much land would it take in cutting hay
 
04:30:19.469 --> 04:30:19.479 align:start position:0%
to get to $60,000 if you get 160 bails
 
04:30:21.990 --> 04:30:22.000 align:start position:0%
per acre maybe $8 a bail it would take
 
04:30:24.670 --> 04:30:24.680 align:start position:0%
45 acres of land so that 3 Acre Farm
 
04:30:25.950 --> 04:30:25.960 align:start position:0%
that you drive past you say well that's
 
04:30:28.189 --> 04:30:28.199 align:start position:0%
a cute little farm a couple acres in a
 
04:30:30.830 --> 04:30:30.840 align:start position:0%
greenhouse they generating more income
 
04:30:33.269 --> 04:30:33.279 align:start position:0%
than somebody who's paying 45 acres of
 
04:30:34.870 --> 04:30:34.880 align:start position:0%
land so we shouldn't just judge the
 
04:30:37.550 --> 04:30:37.560 align:start position:0%
impact of farm Ms by how many acres they
 
04:30:39.309 --> 04:30:39.319 align:start position:0%
have it's how much they're producing to
 
04:30:41.309 --> 04:30:41.319 align:start position:0%
feed their people and also the last
 
04:30:42.870 --> 04:30:42.880 align:start position:0%
thing is that certified organic farms
 
04:30:45.030 --> 04:30:45.040 align:start position:0%
specialize in direct to Consumer sales
 
04:30:47.950 --> 04:30:47.960 align:start position:0%
in that National survey 43% are direct
 
04:30:52.309 --> 04:30:52.319 align:start position:0%
to Consumer 28% do csas 33% sell to
 
04:30:54.030 --> 04:30:54.040 align:start position:0%
retail markets food hubs and
 
04:30:56.109 --> 04:30:56.119 align:start position:0%
institutions we have to look at the
 
04:30:57.469 --> 04:30:57.479 align:start position:0%
future of New Hampshire we don't have
 
04:30:59.750 --> 04:30:59.760 align:start position:0%
the land base of States like New York
 
04:31:01.990 --> 04:31:02.000 align:start position:0%
and Pennsylvania and Ohio and going
 
04:31:04.790 --> 04:31:04.800 align:start position:0%
further we're kind of a hillside State
 
04:31:07.070 --> 04:31:07.080 align:start position:0%
we only have so much good soil in the
 
04:31:09.070 --> 04:31:09.080 align:start position:0%
state so direct to Consumer Farms that
 
04:31:11.309 --> 04:31:11.319 align:start position:0%
are small farms direct to Consumer
 
04:31:14.389 --> 04:31:14.399 align:start position:0%
that's the future of our state so I
 
04:31:16.109 --> 04:31:16.119 align:start position:0%
think just to keep it that way is that
 
04:31:18.469 --> 04:31:18.479 align:start position:0%
organic farms are important and I'm so
 
04:31:19.910 --> 04:31:19.920 align:start position:0%
grateful to hear the commissioner say
 
04:31:21.349 --> 04:31:21.359 align:start position:0%
that he's looking forward to ways to
 
04:31:24.550 --> 04:31:24.560 align:start position:0%
find ways to support and promote organic
 
04:31:26.469 --> 04:31:26.479 align:start position:0%
farming in the state but I urge you to
 
04:31:28.070 --> 04:31:28.080 align:start position:0%
keep this bill on the books because you
 
04:31:29.590 --> 04:31:29.600 align:start position:0%
just never know first of all we should
 
04:31:31.189 --> 04:31:31.199 align:start position:0%
protect the farmers who are certified
 
04:31:32.710 --> 04:31:32.720 align:start position:0%
organic so that nobody can claim they
 
04:31:34.469 --> 04:31:34.479 align:start position:0%
are that if you get rid of this statute
 
04:31:36.070 --> 04:31:36.080 align:start position:0%
there's no protection and who knows
 
04:31:38.070 --> 04:31:38.080 align:start position:0%
maybe down the road things will change
 
04:31:40.269 --> 04:31:40.279 align:start position:0%
and we'll find that 30 40 50% of our
 
04:31:41.790 --> 04:31:41.800 align:start position:0%
sales are organic and then we will want
 
04:31:43.349 --> 04:31:43.359 align:start position:0%
to get back into the certification
 
04:31:44.750 --> 04:31:44.760 align:start position:0%
business you got the the law in the
 
04:31:45.990 --> 04:31:46.000 align:start position:0%
books you don't have to go through all
 
04:31:48.030 --> 04:31:48.040 align:start position:0%
rewriting it all over again it's not
 
04:31:49.630 --> 04:31:49.640 align:start position:0%
costing you anything really to keep it
 
04:31:51.229 --> 04:31:51.239 align:start position:0%
there so thank you very much for your
 
04:31:54.630 --> 04:31:54.640 align:start position:0%
time appreciate any questions from the
 
04:31:56.950 --> 04:31:56.960 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none thank you very
 
04:32:04.469 --> 04:32:04.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:07.389 --> 04:32:07.399 align:start position:0%
DRS you did not indicate support or
 
04:32:11.189 --> 04:32:11.199 align:start position:0%
oppose or just not neither yeah
 
04:32:21.149 --> 04:32:21.159 align:start position:0%

specifically
 
04:33:19.470 --> 04:33:19.480 align:start position:0%
uh the USDA National organic program
 
04:33:21.670 --> 04:33:21.680 align:start position:0%

the ACT if a product is sold labeled or
 
04:33:33.750 --> 04:33:33.760 align:start position:0%
represent it as organic then it must be
 
04:33:35.990 --> 04:33:36.000 align:start position:0%
produced in accordance with the ACT and
 
04:33:38.629 --> 04:33:38.639 align:start position:0%
NOP regulations from section
 
04:33:41.709 --> 04:33:41.719 align:start position:0%
20512 there is a very specific uh
 
04:33:43.551 --> 04:33:43.561 align:start position:0%
reference as well that enforcement of
 
04:33:45.869 --> 04:33:45.879 align:start position:0%
the use of the word organic is overseen
 
04:33:48.670 --> 04:33:48.680 align:start position:0%
and litigated by the NOP and not and
 
04:33:51.310 --> 04:33:51.320 align:start position:0%
cannot be litigated by the state and
 
04:33:55.150 --> 04:33:55.160 align:start position:0%
there is an actual website for the
 
04:33:56.990 --> 04:33:57.000 align:start position:0%
complaint and enforcement of the use of
 
04:33:58.551 --> 04:33:58.561 align:start position:0%
the inappropriate use of the word
 
04:34:00.789 --> 04:34:00.799 align:start position:0%
organic uh so it had been my
 
04:34:02.750 --> 04:34:02.760 align:start position:0%
recommendation initially to take
 
04:34:04.670 --> 04:34:04.680 align:start position:0%
references to the use of the word
 
04:34:07.349 --> 04:34:07.359 align:start position:0%
organic enforcement of the use of the
 
04:34:10.910 --> 04:34:10.920 align:start position:0%
word organic or labeling such as in 426
 
04:34:13.429 --> 04:34:13.439 align:start position:0%
6A relative to the use of the word
 
04:34:16.429 --> 04:34:16.439 align:start position:0%
organic out of our rsas because we have
 
04:34:19.349 --> 04:34:19.359 align:start position:0%
actual no the state has no legal
 
04:34:20.789 --> 04:34:20.799 align:start position:0%
Authority and I'm telling you that as a
 
04:34:23.830 --> 04:34:23.840 align:start position:0%
federal agent executive director of the
 
04:34:30.109 --> 04:34:30.119 align:start position:0%
NLP program so I mean that's that's it
 
04:34:34.109 --> 04:34:34.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:36.029 --> 04:34:36.039 align:start position:0%
committee okay
 
04:34:37.629 --> 04:34:37.639 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby I'd just like to
 
04:34:39.510 --> 04:34:39.520 align:start position:0%
make a note for the committee which is
 
04:34:42.029 --> 04:34:42.039 align:start position:0%
that um the bill that we heard this
 
04:34:45.390 --> 04:34:45.400 align:start position:0%
morning uh included the the removal of
 
04:34:49.429 --> 04:34:49.439 align:start position:0%
those as per director Wyman's um
 
04:34:54.109 --> 04:34:54.119 align:start position:0%
recommendation so uh so that that that
 
04:34:57.869 --> 04:34:57.879 align:start position:0%
is already we've already acted on
 
04:34:57.879 --> 04:34:59.750 align:start position:0%
is already we've already acted on
that

04:34:59.750 --> 04:34:59.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:35:02.670 --> 04:35:02.680 align:start position:0%
right well we haven't exec that we
 
04:35:04.629 --> 04:35:04.639 align:start position:0%
haven't exec that bill we heard it we've
 
04:35:08.029 --> 04:35:08.039 align:start position:0%
already heard it yeah yeah okay all
 
04:35:11.590 --> 04:35:11.600 align:start position:0%
right anyone else wish to speak on this
 
04:35:16.429 --> 04:35:16.439 align:start position:0%
bill seeing none I'm going to close the
 
04:35:16.439 --> 04:35:18.269 align:start position:0%
bill seeing none I'm going to close the
hearing

04:35:18.269 --> 04:35:18.279 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
04:35:21.150 --> 04:35:21.160 align:start position:0%
for what's the number again
 
04:35:24.551 --> 04:35:24.561 align:start position:0%
HB 1578 I'm closing the hearing for that
 
04:35:26.629 --> 04:35:26.639 align:start position:0%
I need the blue
 
04:35:29.750 --> 04:35:29.760 align:start position:0%
sheet and uh let's see what there's
 
04:35:29.760 --> 04:35:34.189 align:start position:0%
sheet and uh let's see what there's
anything

04:35:34.189 --> 04:35:34.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:34.199 --> 04:35:38.029 align:start position:0%
 
online

04:35:38.029 --> 04:35:38.039 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:41.470 --> 04:35:41.480 align:start position:0%
see nothing online nothing there and
 
04:35:51.310 --> 04:35:51.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:51.320 --> 04:35:59.709 align:start position:0%
 
online

04:35:59.709 --> 04:35:59.719 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:04.789 --> 04:36:04.799 align:start position:0%
s78 we had um three in support and 95
 
04:36:13.349 --> 04:36:13.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:18.070 --> 04:36:18.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:21.750 --> 04:36:21.760 align:start position:0%
um I suppose after we hear the next two
 
04:36:25.390 --> 04:36:25.400 align:start position:0%
bills we can exec out um this bill that
 
04:36:27.390 --> 04:36:27.400 align:start position:0%
we just heard and the two that we heard
 
04:36:29.709 --> 04:36:29.719 align:start position:0%
this morning yeah um if that would be
 
04:36:31.830 --> 04:36:31.840 align:start position:0%
okay with the committee absolutely all
 
04:36:34.269 --> 04:36:34.279 align:start position:0%
right um so we're going to proceed with
 
04:36:37.230 --> 04:36:37.240 align:start position:0%
HB opening the hearing for HB
 
04:36:39.670 --> 04:36:39.680 align:start position:0%
1529 relative to the use of
 
04:36:39.680 --> 04:36:41.629 align:start position:0%
1529 relative to the use of
unpasteurized

04:36:41.629 --> 04:36:41.639 align:start position:0%
unpasteurized
 
04:36:46.709 --> 04:36:46.719 align:start position:0%
eggs and uh let's see that's
 
04:36:49.310 --> 04:36:49.320 align:start position:0%
1529 and the sponsor of the bill is
 
04:36:49.320 --> 04:36:50.949 align:start position:0%
1529 and the sponsor of the bill is
representative

04:36:50.949 --> 04:36:50.959 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:36:54.109 --> 04:36:54.119 align:start position:0%
Sullivan here to introduce the bill yeah
 
04:36:54.119 --> 04:36:57.670 align:start position:0%
Sullivan here to introduce the bill yeah
all

04:36:57.670 --> 04:36:57.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:00.230 --> 04:37:00.240 align:start position:0%
right thank you welcome to environment
 
04:37:01.910 --> 04:37:01.920 align:start position:0%
and agriculture yeah thanks for having
 
04:37:04.789 --> 04:37:04.799 align:start position:0%
me it's great um so yeah so this is
 
04:37:08.029 --> 04:37:08.039 align:start position:0%
pretty simple maybe somebody from Health
 
04:37:10.029 --> 04:37:10.039 align:start position:0%
and Human Services can explain that
 
04:37:11.390 --> 04:37:11.400 align:start position:0%
somebody suggested this might be in
 
04:37:12.949 --> 04:37:12.959 align:start position:0%
rules and maybe something that doesn't
 
04:37:14.949 --> 04:37:14.959 align:start position:0%
need to be addressed but this is pretty
 
04:37:16.470 --> 04:37:16.480 align:start position:0%
simple basically what happened was
 
04:37:18.029 --> 04:37:18.039 align:start position:0%
there's a constituent of mine who own
 
04:37:21.629 --> 04:37:21.639 align:start position:0%
ice cream store she would like she likes
 
04:37:23.869 --> 04:37:23.879 align:start position:0%
to work on using everything as local as
 
04:37:25.869 --> 04:37:25.879 align:start position:0%
possible she so she can list the sources
 
04:37:28.230 --> 04:37:28.240 align:start position:0%
of all of her ingredients up on the up
 
04:37:30.990 --> 04:37:31.000 align:start position:0%
on her board when you walk into her her
 
04:37:33.949 --> 04:37:33.959 align:start position:0%
restaurant and when she's making ice
 
04:37:37.230 --> 04:37:37.240 align:start position:0%
cream she is required to use pasteurized
 
04:37:40.349 --> 04:37:40.359 align:start position:0%
eggs as an input even though the process
 
04:37:43.230 --> 04:37:43.240 align:start position:0%
of making ice cream it pasteurizes in
 
04:37:45.349 --> 04:37:45.359 align:start position:0%
the machine and so she asked me if there
 
04:37:47.709 --> 04:37:47.719 align:start position:0%
was something we could do about it and
 
04:37:49.629 --> 04:37:49.639 align:start position:0%
it was at the very end of the bill
 
04:37:50.990 --> 04:37:51.000 align:start position:0%
filing session so I didn't have a lot of
 
04:37:52.789 --> 04:37:52.799 align:start position:0%
time to research what the rules were and
 
04:37:54.390 --> 04:37:54.400 align:start position:0%
stuff like that because I think I was up
 
04:37:56.750 --> 04:37:56.760 align:start position:0%
against like an hour or two before
 
04:37:59.789 --> 04:37:59.799 align:start position:0%
filing deadlines uh closed so uh the
 
04:38:03.150 --> 04:38:03.160 align:start position:0%
goal of this is is basically if you have
 
04:38:06.150 --> 04:38:06.160 align:start position:0%
uh a process that includes pasturization
 
04:38:07.510 --> 04:38:07.520 align:start position:0%
later in the process you can use an
 
04:38:07.520 --> 04:38:08.709 align:start position:0%
later in the process you can use an
unpasturized

04:38:08.709 --> 04:38:08.719 align:start position:0%
unpasturized
 
04:38:10.789 --> 04:38:10.799 align:start position:0%
egg right now she's getting eggs that
 
04:38:12.390 --> 04:38:12.400 align:start position:0%
are pre- pasturized they come from like
 
04:38:15.150 --> 04:38:15.160 align:start position:0%
Cisco or wherever and she would like to
 
04:38:17.230 --> 04:38:17.240 align:start position:0%
just go to the local farms in my
 
04:38:19.470 --> 04:38:19.480 align:start position:0%
community to get eggs to make her ice
 
04:38:21.551 --> 04:38:21.561 align:start position:0%
cream so that's the bill or the idea of
 
04:38:21.561 --> 04:38:23.590 align:start position:0%
cream so that's the bill or the idea of
the

04:38:23.590 --> 04:38:23.600 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:38:30.670 --> 04:38:30.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:33.830 --> 04:38:33.840 align:start position:0%
committee representative Howard thank
 
04:38:35.349 --> 04:38:35.359 align:start position:0%
you madam chair and do you know the
 
04:38:38.230 --> 04:38:38.240 align:start position:0%
process that use to pasteurize eggs um I
 
04:38:41.029 --> 04:38:41.039 align:start position:0%
I I have chickens and if I give my eggs
 
04:38:43.150 --> 04:38:43.160 align:start position:0%
away I I just wash them with soap and
 
04:38:45.070 --> 04:38:45.080 align:start position:0%
water is it is it more than
 
04:38:48.590 --> 04:38:48.600 align:start position:0%
that um I think it involves the
 
04:38:50.709 --> 04:38:50.719 align:start position:0%
pasteurizing involves heating I believe
 
04:38:53.551 --> 04:38:53.561 align:start position:0%
and so when she makes the I don't know
 
04:38:55.230 --> 04:38:55.240 align:start position:0%
the right word is the base or the batter
 
04:38:56.670 --> 04:38:56.680 align:start position:0%
I don't know what you call it for making
 
04:38:58.910 --> 04:38:58.920 align:start position:0%
ice cream but when she makes that she
 
04:39:00.390 --> 04:39:00.400 align:start position:0%
puts into the ice cream machine and it
 
04:39:02.709 --> 04:39:02.719 align:start position:0%
gets heated up for an extended period of
 
04:39:05.590 --> 04:39:05.600 align:start position:0%
time and so
 
04:39:07.189 --> 04:39:07.199 align:start position:0%
I would think that that would count
 
04:39:09.109 --> 04:39:09.119 align:start position:0%
because it's it's very hot it's like
 
04:39:09.119 --> 04:39:10.150 align:start position:0%
because it's it's very hot it's like
cooking

04:39:10.150 --> 04:39:10.160 align:start position:0%
cooking
 
04:39:13.029 --> 04:39:13.039 align:start position:0%
essentially um May it maybe maybe
 
04:39:14.070 --> 04:39:14.080 align:start position:0%
there's somebody who knows more than me
 
04:39:16.670 --> 04:39:16.680 align:start position:0%
on this um but that I I believe
 
04:39:18.789 --> 04:39:18.799 align:start position:0%
pasteurizing is is involved a heating
 
04:39:20.390 --> 04:39:20.400 align:start position:0%
it's not just cleaning it's heating of
 
04:39:23.230 --> 04:39:23.240 align:start position:0%
things represent Bixby okay so um I'm
 
04:39:25.551 --> 04:39:25.561 align:start position:0%
gonna kind of as ask this as a kind of
 
04:39:28.629 --> 04:39:28.639 align:start position:0%
leading question so uh if you're using
 
04:39:30.390 --> 04:39:30.400 align:start position:0%
eggs and ice cream you're typically
 
04:39:32.390 --> 04:39:32.400 align:start position:0%
that's typically called the custard
 
04:39:35.789 --> 04:39:35.799 align:start position:0%
based ice cream and the
 
04:39:39.590 --> 04:39:39.600 align:start position:0%
so typically one would make the custard
 
04:39:42.910 --> 04:39:42.920 align:start position:0%
and then be before which is a heating
 
04:39:46.350 --> 04:39:46.360 align:start position:0%
process before uh the freezing process
 
04:39:49.390 --> 04:39:49.400 align:start position:0%
where you then turn it into ice cream uh
 
04:39:52.628 --> 04:39:52.638 align:start position:0%
and is that is that basically what she's
 
04:39:56.510 --> 04:39:56.520 align:start position:0%
doing uh she does heat it and then the
 
04:39:59.110 --> 04:39:59.120 align:start position:0%
way it works is I did make the ice cream
 
04:40:00.750 --> 04:40:00.760 align:start position:0%
there for one period of time so I do
 
04:40:02.670 --> 04:40:02.680 align:start position:0%
know a little bit about it but yeah we
 
04:40:04.390 --> 04:40:04.400 align:start position:0%
would we we would blend everything into
 
04:40:06.230 --> 04:40:06.240 align:start position:0%
thing we pour it into the machine it
 
04:40:07.990 --> 04:40:08.000 align:start position:0%
would heat for a while and then you drop
 
04:40:11.070 --> 04:40:11.080 align:start position:0%
it into the next thing to to chill it
 
04:40:13.030 --> 04:40:13.040 align:start position:0%
and then you pour it out of that you put
 
04:40:14.910 --> 04:40:14.920 align:start position:0%
in the tubs you freeze
 
04:40:17.430 --> 04:40:17.440 align:start position:0%
it representative
 
04:40:19.670 --> 04:40:19.680 align:start position:0%
Murray thank you madam chair I think the
 
04:40:21.670 --> 04:40:21.680 align:start position:0%
process that you're referring to is
 
04:40:24.030 --> 04:40:24.040 align:start position:0%
called tempering when you're bringing
 
04:40:25.990 --> 04:40:26.000 align:start position:0%
the batter or what have you up to
 
04:40:28.550 --> 04:40:28.560 align:start position:0%
temperature you're cooking the mixture
 
04:40:32.590 --> 04:40:32.600 align:start position:0%
and you're heating that um and then um
 
04:40:34.788 --> 04:40:34.798 align:start position:0%
so there is a there is a cooking process
 
04:40:37.390 --> 04:40:37.400 align:start position:0%
process to the eggs is is what you're I
 
04:40:40.430 --> 04:40:40.440 align:start position:0%
think getting at
 
04:40:45.150 --> 04:40:45.160 align:start position:0%
yes okay so a according to statute the
 
04:40:48.230 --> 04:40:48.240 align:start position:0%
way statute is now is she prohibited
 
04:40:49.948 --> 04:40:49.958 align:start position:0%
from producing this
 
04:40:52.708 --> 04:40:52.718 align:start position:0%
product she's prohibited from using
 
04:40:55.910 --> 04:40:55.920 align:start position:0%
local eggs because there's no local egg
 
04:40:59.030 --> 04:40:59.040 align:start position:0%
that is pre pasteurized so the eggs as
 
04:41:03.070 --> 04:41:03.080 align:start position:0%
an input into the batter or the the base
 
04:41:06.190 --> 04:41:06.200 align:start position:0%
are not p are pastu are required to be
 
04:41:07.708 --> 04:41:07.718 align:start position:0%
pasteurized and she can't find a New
 
04:41:12.070 --> 04:41:12.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire or a local based source of um
 
04:41:13.628 --> 04:41:13.638 align:start position:0%
pasteurized eggs so she's buying them
 
04:41:15.390 --> 04:41:15.400 align:start position:0%
from like a food supplier everything
 
04:41:17.190 --> 04:41:17.200 align:start position:0%
else she where did she get that
 
04:41:19.510 --> 04:41:19.520 align:start position:0%
information that she needed pasteurized
 
04:41:21.868 --> 04:41:21.878 align:start position:0%
eggs uh when they were giving her her
 
04:41:21.878 --> 04:41:22.910 align:start position:0%
eggs uh when they were giving her her
food

04:41:22.910 --> 04:41:22.920 align:start position:0%
food
 
04:41:22.920 --> 04:41:24.430 align:start position:0%
food
license

04:41:24.430 --> 04:41:24.440 align:start position:0%
license
 
04:41:27.868 --> 04:41:27.878 align:start position:0%
okay all right represent Bixby okay so
 
04:41:31.230 --> 04:41:31.240 align:start position:0%
this might be more of a question for um
 
04:41:33.110 --> 04:41:33.120 align:start position:0%
the folks from food Pro Protective
 
04:41:35.350 --> 04:41:35.360 align:start position:0%
Services but uh
 
04:41:37.470 --> 04:41:37.480 align:start position:0%
when I looked in statute I I basically
 
04:41:39.708 --> 04:41:39.718 align:start position:0%
did a search on eggs and I didn't find
 
04:41:42.670 --> 04:41:42.680 align:start position:0%
anything in statute on eggs uh so my
 
04:41:46.070 --> 04:41:46.080 align:start position:0%
guesses it might be in rules yeah okay
 
04:41:48.670 --> 04:41:48.680 align:start position:0%
that's possible and and so I I mean
 
04:41:50.990 --> 04:41:51.000 align:start position:0%
maybe it could be addressed in rules or
 
04:41:53.190 --> 04:41:53.200 align:start position:0%
maybe this will take care of that but uh
 
04:41:55.948 --> 04:41:55.958 align:start position:0%
that is the intention of this and like I
 
04:41:58.190 --> 04:41:58.200 align:start position:0%
said when I was introducing the
 
04:42:01.230 --> 04:42:01.240 align:start position:0%
bill this was a very late request that
 
04:42:03.990 --> 04:42:04.000 align:start position:0%
she came to me with um like I said I
 
04:42:05.590 --> 04:42:05.600 align:start position:0%
think it was whatever that Friday is the
 
04:42:07.270 --> 04:42:07.280 align:start position:0%
last day we could file bills and it was
 
04:42:08.590 --> 04:42:08.600 align:start position:0%
in the afternoon so I didn't have a lot
 
04:42:10.070 --> 04:42:10.080 align:start position:0%
of time so I yes I was like I'll I'll
 
04:42:12.628 --> 04:42:12.638 align:start position:0%
explain it to them and get it out I just
 
04:42:14.788 --> 04:42:14.798 align:start position:0%
didn't have time to like actually do the
 
04:42:16.470 --> 04:42:16.480 align:start position:0%
the research process that we that I did
 
04:42:18.910 --> 04:42:18.920 align:start position:0%
for other bills that I
 
04:42:22.230 --> 04:42:22.240 align:start position:0%
introduced any other questions from the
 
04:42:24.628 --> 04:42:24.638 align:start position:0%
committee thank you for introducing the
 
04:42:29.510 --> 04:42:29.520 align:start position:0%
bill and um I now call Colleen Smith
 
04:42:33.550 --> 04:42:33.560 align:start position:0%
from DHHS to come and
 
04:42:33.560 --> 04:42:40.030 align:start position:0%
from DHHS to come and
speak

04:42:40.030 --> 04:42:40.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:40.040 --> 04:42:41.708 align:start position:0%
 
good

04:42:41.708 --> 04:42:41.718 align:start position:0%
good
 
04:42:43.990 --> 04:42:44.000 align:start position:0%
afternoon good afternoon Madam chair and
 
04:42:45.430 --> 04:42:45.440 align:start position:0%
members of the committee thank you for
 
04:42:48.470 --> 04:42:48.480 align:start position:0%
allowing us to speak on House Bill 1529
 
04:42:50.788 --> 04:42:50.798 align:start position:0%
relative to egg pasteurization and I
 
04:42:53.430 --> 04:42:53.440 align:start position:0%
actually have Chuck matap who supervises
 
04:42:55.350 --> 04:42:55.360 align:start position:0%
our Dairy program he's actually here to
 
04:42:57.910 --> 04:42:57.920 align:start position:0%
testify in the next bill but but he also
 
04:43:00.230 --> 04:43:00.240 align:start position:0%
is an expert on on ice cream production
 
04:43:02.110 --> 04:43:02.120 align:start position:0%
so he would definitely be able to add to
 
04:43:05.350 --> 04:43:05.360 align:start position:0%
this conversation okay so um
 
04:43:07.750 --> 04:43:07.760 align:start position:0%
what the bill is proposing that
 
04:43:10.190 --> 04:43:10.200 align:start position:0%
the unpasturized eggs are already
 
04:43:14.470 --> 04:43:14.480 align:start position:0%
allowed to be used at retail uh either
 
04:43:17.350 --> 04:43:17.360 align:start position:0%
at a restaurant or a retail food store
 
04:43:19.470 --> 04:43:19.480 align:start position:0%
if they are offered in an undercooked
 
04:43:22.750 --> 04:43:22.760 align:start position:0%
form there has to be a menu disclosure
 
04:43:26.390 --> 04:43:26.400 align:start position:0%
and and a warning that consuming uh raw
 
04:43:27.990 --> 04:43:28.000 align:start position:0%
or undercooked eggs could lead to food
 
04:43:29.788 --> 04:43:29.798 align:start position:0%
born illness so there might be some
 
04:43:31.990 --> 04:43:32.000 align:start position:0%
confusion with what this particular
 
04:43:35.310 --> 04:43:35.320 align:start position:0%
person was looking to do um I can tell
 
04:43:36.750 --> 04:43:36.760 align:start position:0%
you that when you call something
 
04:43:39.270 --> 04:43:39.280 align:start position:0%
pasteurized it doesn't necessarily it
 
04:43:40.990 --> 04:43:41.000 align:start position:0%
there is a temperature involved but it's
 
04:43:43.708 --> 04:43:43.718 align:start position:0%
also equipment that's involved and that
 
04:43:45.948 --> 04:43:45.958 align:start position:0%
that that term pasteurization it means
 
04:43:48.470 --> 04:43:48.480 align:start position:0%
that it's it's conducted by an actual
 
04:43:51.830 --> 04:43:51.840 align:start position:0%
tested pasteurizer and Mr Med can also
 
04:43:54.510 --> 04:43:54.520 align:start position:0%
add add Clarity if there are specific
 
04:43:57.510 --> 04:43:57.520 align:start position:0%
questions regarding that
 
04:44:00.030 --> 04:44:00.040 align:start position:0%
process representative Marie thank you
 
04:44:01.550 --> 04:44:01.560 align:start position:0%
madam chair and thank you for taking my
 
04:44:05.150 --> 04:44:05.160 align:start position:0%
question so with regard to the is there
 
04:44:07.830 --> 04:44:07.840 align:start position:0%
anything stated in rules or in statute
 
04:44:09.788 --> 04:44:09.798 align:start position:0%
otherwise because we have done some you
 
04:44:11.830 --> 04:44:11.840 align:start position:0%
know deep diving a little bit to take a
 
04:44:14.670 --> 04:44:14.680 align:start position:0%
look at the concept of quote the use of
 
04:44:16.990 --> 04:44:17.000 align:start position:0%
unpasteurized eggs and we couldn't find
 
04:44:18.830 --> 04:44:18.840 align:start position:0%
anything in statute so could you
 
04:44:22.030 --> 04:44:22.040 align:start position:0%
elaborate on if there is anything in
 
04:44:25.230 --> 04:44:25.240 align:start position:0%
rules that would have this would could
 
04:44:28.310 --> 04:44:28.320 align:start position:0%
potentially lead to this conclusion So
 
04:44:31.550 --> 04:44:31.560 align:start position:0%
within our our rules we have adopted the
 
04:44:34.350 --> 04:44:34.360 align:start position:0%
2017 Federal food code and so that would
 
04:44:37.470 --> 04:44:37.480 align:start position:0%
would require any raw eggs used um that
 
04:44:39.430 --> 04:44:39.440 align:start position:0%
were not going that weren't presented as
 
04:44:41.670 --> 04:44:41.680 align:start position:0%
being in an undercooked or raw form as
 
04:44:45.390 --> 04:44:45.400 align:start position:0%
being cooked to 165 um if you're using
 
04:44:47.750 --> 04:44:47.760 align:start position:0%
an egg product like a liquid egg a
 
04:44:49.910 --> 04:44:49.920 align:start position:0%
commercial liquid egg product that has
 
04:44:51.910 --> 04:44:51.920 align:start position:0%
to be that has to be from a pasteurized
 
04:44:54.070 --> 04:44:54.080 align:start position:0%
Source from a food processing plant in a
 
04:44:57.350 --> 04:44:57.360 align:start position:0%
pasteurized from a pasteurized Source
 
04:44:59.390 --> 04:44:59.400 align:start position:0%
follow up you thank you and when you're
 
04:45:00.708 --> 04:45:00.718 align:start position:0%
talking about a liquid product you're
 
04:45:01.990 --> 04:45:02.000 align:start position:0%
talking about sometimes those things
 
04:45:03.868 --> 04:45:03.878 align:start position:0%
that come in the boxes that have already
 
04:45:06.550 --> 04:45:06.560 align:start position:0%
been cracked act they're um in a in a
 
04:45:08.868 --> 04:45:08.878 align:start position:0%
container whether it's whites or whites
 
04:45:10.830 --> 04:45:10.840 align:start position:0%
and yolks together is that correct
 
04:45:12.150 --> 04:45:12.160 align:start position:0%
correct something that you would buy
 
04:45:15.110 --> 04:45:15.120 align:start position:0%
from a of a commercial processor of of
 
04:45:18.030 --> 04:45:18.040 align:start position:0%
eggs already in a liquid form okay thank
 
04:45:20.030 --> 04:45:20.040 align:start position:0%
you so so how do they how do they
 
04:45:21.830 --> 04:45:21.840 align:start position:0%
pasturize it with actually without
 
04:45:24.948 --> 04:45:24.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:28.910 --> 04:45:28.920 align:start position:0%
egg so um I guess to try to answer that
 
04:45:31.350 --> 04:45:31.360 align:start position:0%
question I'll also reference it back to
 
04:45:33.830 --> 04:45:33.840 align:start position:0%
um how the bill was introduced so we
 
04:45:33.840 --> 04:45:34.948 align:start position:0%
um how the bill was introduced so we
currently

04:45:34.948 --> 04:45:34.958 align:start position:0%
currently
 
04:45:38.750 --> 04:45:38.760 align:start position:0%
already allow raw eggs to be part of an
 
04:45:41.628 --> 04:45:41.638 align:start position:0%
ingredient to be used to make ice cream
 
04:45:44.030 --> 04:45:44.040 align:start position:0%
as long as that ice cream mix is going
 
04:45:46.628 --> 04:45:46.638 align:start position:0%
to be pasteurized um I have this
 
04:45:49.270 --> 04:45:49.280 align:start position:0%
question um asked probably three or four
 
04:45:51.550 --> 04:45:51.560 align:start position:0%
times a year that we get inquiries I
 
04:45:53.110 --> 04:45:53.120 align:start position:0%
don't know that they all move forward
 
04:45:56.390 --> 04:45:56.400 align:start position:0%
with it but it is currently allowed with
 
04:45:58.750 --> 04:45:58.760 align:start position:0%
um within our Dairy program which
 
04:46:02.270 --> 04:46:02.280 align:start position:0%
licenses the wholesale operations we do
 
04:46:04.510 --> 04:46:04.520 align:start position:0%
not in the dairy program we do not
 
04:46:06.670 --> 04:46:06.680 align:start position:0%
licensed like a restaurant making it and
 
04:46:08.310 --> 04:46:08.320 align:start position:0%
only serving it to their immediate
 
04:46:09.628 --> 04:46:09.638 align:start position:0%
customer that would fall back to the
 
04:46:12.510 --> 04:46:12.520 align:start position:0%
retail food program and when you
 
04:46:15.230 --> 04:46:15.240 align:start position:0%
pasteurize the mix you're bringing it up
 
04:46:18.670 --> 04:46:18.680 align:start position:0%
to a minimum of 100 um and usually it's
 
04:46:20.990 --> 04:46:21.000 align:start position:0%
150 and you're going to hold it there
 
04:46:24.750 --> 04:46:24.760 align:start position:0%
for 30 minutes and that will not cook
 
04:46:26.788 --> 04:46:26.798 align:start position:0%
the egg to the point where it's you're
 
04:46:28.788 --> 04:46:28.798 align:start position:0%
going to have egg Parts in it it's just
 
04:46:31.548 --> 04:46:31.558 align:start position:0%
going to be like a milkshake type of
 
04:46:33.510 --> 04:46:33.520 align:start position:0%
consistency that you then run through
 
04:46:36.230 --> 04:46:36.240 align:start position:0%
your batch freezer that turns it into
 
04:46:39.030 --> 04:46:39.040 align:start position:0%
what you're used to seeing as ice
 
04:46:43.590 --> 04:46:43.600 align:start position:0%
cream okay um yes uh represent
 
04:46:45.708 --> 04:46:45.718 align:start position:0%
Murray thank you madam chair so when
 
04:46:47.470 --> 04:46:47.480 align:start position:0%
we're talking about prep pasteurized
 
04:46:51.110 --> 04:46:51.120 align:start position:0%
eggs are we talking about a like a a
 
04:46:53.310 --> 04:46:53.320 align:start position:0%
radiated like pre- pasteurized so that
 
04:46:55.708 --> 04:46:55.718 align:start position:0%
they're still liquid they're not in this
 
04:46:57.510 --> 04:46:57.520 align:start position:0%
a milkshake form or what have you is
 
04:46:58.868 --> 04:46:58.878 align:start position:0%
there is there any process like that
 
04:47:01.230 --> 04:47:01.240 align:start position:0%
where the eggs are coming shelled or in
 
04:47:03.070 --> 04:47:03.080 align:start position:0%
the liquid form where they are
 
04:47:04.628 --> 04:47:04.638 align:start position:0%
pasteurized in that
 
04:47:08.070 --> 04:47:08.080 align:start position:0%
way so there are spec there are specific
 
04:47:11.830 --> 04:47:11.840 align:start position:0%
processes that can pasteurize an inshell
 
04:47:14.868 --> 04:47:14.878 align:start position:0%
egg um they're we they're very expensive
 
04:47:16.350 --> 04:47:16.360 align:start position:0%
so they're not very common in the
 
04:47:18.390 --> 04:47:18.400 align:start position:0%
marketplace the time often time that you
 
04:47:21.150 --> 04:47:21.160 align:start position:0%
would find them is um usually serving a
 
04:47:23.310 --> 04:47:23.320 align:start position:0%
highly susceptible population like in a
 
04:47:25.430 --> 04:47:25.440 align:start position:0%
a hospital nursing home scenario but
 
04:47:27.910 --> 04:47:27.920 align:start position:0%
there is technology that can actually
 
04:47:30.948 --> 04:47:30.958 align:start position:0%
pasturize an inshell inshell egg and
 
04:47:32.670 --> 04:47:32.680 align:start position:0%
they're they have a little pee on the
 
04:47:34.670 --> 04:47:34.680 align:start position:0%
outside of them but as I said we don't
 
04:47:36.910 --> 04:47:36.920 align:start position:0%
really see those um in retail
 
04:47:39.190 --> 04:47:39.200 align:start position:0%
establishments because they are very
 
04:47:43.670 --> 04:47:43.680 align:start position:0%
costly represent Bixby okay so uh just
 
04:47:46.628 --> 04:47:46.638 align:start position:0%
for clarity in terms of the problem that
 
04:47:50.070 --> 04:47:50.080 align:start position:0%
brought this bill forward would uh
 
04:47:53.030 --> 04:47:53.040 align:start position:0%
representative Sullivan's uh constient
 
04:47:58.310 --> 04:47:58.320 align:start position:0%
constituent already be um okay under the
 
04:48:01.628 --> 04:48:01.638 align:start position:0%
uh based on the fact that she's uh the
 
04:48:03.310 --> 04:48:03.320 align:start position:0%
machine she's using to make her ice
 
04:48:06.510 --> 04:48:06.520 align:start position:0%
cream raises the custard to temperature
 
04:48:09.510 --> 04:48:09.520 align:start position:0%
for a period and then before it's then
 
04:48:11.430 --> 04:48:11.440 align:start position:0%
chilled and
 
04:48:14.350 --> 04:48:14.360 align:start position:0%
Frozen so as long as she was only
 
04:48:16.590 --> 04:48:16.600 align:start position:0%
offering it through her retail
 
04:48:18.110 --> 04:48:18.120 align:start position:0%
establishment so if she wanted to
 
04:48:20.150 --> 04:48:20.160 align:start position:0%
package it and sell it to other
 
04:48:22.510 --> 04:48:22.520 align:start position:0%
businesses that's when she would have to
 
04:48:24.948 --> 04:48:24.958 align:start position:0%
have a fully pasteurized
 
04:48:29.150 --> 04:48:29.160 align:start position:0%
product okay so uh and followup please
 
04:48:33.150 --> 04:48:33.160 align:start position:0%
followup yeah uh so um so the so the
 
04:48:35.990 --> 04:48:36.000 align:start position:0%
fully so
 
04:48:39.230 --> 04:48:39.240 align:start position:0%
um would the would the fully pasteurized
 
04:48:42.110 --> 04:48:42.120 align:start position:0%
product have to be a product that is you
 
04:48:44.470 --> 04:48:44.480 align:start position:0%
know starting with pasteurized eggs or
 
04:48:48.670 --> 04:48:48.680 align:start position:0%
would could it could she use the uh the
 
04:48:52.510 --> 04:48:52.520 align:start position:0%
um Regular you the the real
 
04:48:56.270 --> 04:48:56.280 align:start position:0%
EGS and then incl put those into the mix
 
04:48:59.190 --> 04:48:59.200 align:start position:0%
and then pasteurize the mix uh and then
 
04:49:00.390 --> 04:49:00.400 align:start position:0%
produce the ice cream from that
 
04:49:02.910 --> 04:49:02.920 align:start position:0%
pasteurized mix the answer would be yes
 
04:49:05.030 --> 04:49:05.040 align:start position:0%
she would be allowed to go down and get
 
04:49:07.510 --> 04:49:07.520 align:start position:0%
her Source her eggs locally she could
 
04:49:10.190 --> 04:49:10.200 align:start position:0%
also be starting out with raw milk um
 
04:49:12.750 --> 04:49:12.760 align:start position:0%
because this mixture as we're talking
 
04:49:14.230 --> 04:49:14.240 align:start position:0%
about is going to undergo the
 
04:49:17.470 --> 04:49:17.480 align:start position:0%
pasteurization step so uh typically in a
 
04:49:19.510 --> 04:49:19.520 align:start position:0%
scenario like this the questions that I
 
04:49:21.390 --> 04:49:21.400 align:start position:0%
get asked is this person would like to
 
04:49:23.470 --> 04:49:23.480 align:start position:0%
start out with their own raw milk
 
04:49:25.548 --> 04:49:25.558 align:start position:0%
typically it's also using their own raw
 
04:49:28.510 --> 04:49:28.520 align:start position:0%
eggs from their own Farm um and then
 
04:49:29.830 --> 04:49:29.840 align:start position:0%
they put everything together with the
 
04:49:32.310 --> 04:49:32.320 align:start position:0%
sugars or whatever else their base mix
 
04:49:34.430 --> 04:49:34.440 align:start position:0%
for their ice cream is is looking to
 
04:49:36.830 --> 04:49:36.840 align:start position:0%
have in it some use stabilizer some
 
04:49:39.868 --> 04:49:39.878 align:start position:0%
don't want to they pasteurize that in as
 
04:49:42.030 --> 04:49:42.040 align:start position:0%
Colleen said the pasteurization
 
04:49:43.910 --> 04:49:43.920 align:start position:0%
equipment that we would look for and
 
04:49:45.830 --> 04:49:45.840 align:start position:0%
then they turn it into ice cream and
 
04:49:49.110 --> 04:49:49.120 align:start position:0%
sell it um wholesale and Retail
 
04:49:53.590 --> 04:49:53.600 align:start position:0%
typically at that point okay uh followup
 
04:49:56.708 --> 04:49:56.718 align:start position:0%
so the main difference between uh being
 
04:49:58.910 --> 04:49:58.920 align:start position:0%
able to do it retail and doing it
 
04:50:02.590 --> 04:50:02.600 align:start position:0%
wholesale is that you need to have uh
 
04:50:05.470 --> 04:50:05.480 align:start position:0%
equipment that was certified as U
 
04:50:08.270 --> 04:50:08.280 align:start position:0%
pasteurizing equipment and but beyond
 
04:50:11.590 --> 04:50:11.600 align:start position:0%
that as long as the steps are are made
 
04:50:14.110 --> 04:50:14.120 align:start position:0%
to heat it to the appropriate
 
04:50:16.590 --> 04:50:16.600 align:start position:0%
temperature for the appropriate time uh
 
04:50:18.990 --> 04:50:19.000 align:start position:0%
it would be Avail wholesale retail would
 
04:50:22.750 --> 04:50:22.760 align:start position:0%
be fine uh but the you need special
 
04:50:24.948 --> 04:50:24.958 align:start position:0%
equipment for wholesale is that correct
 
04:50:27.070 --> 04:50:27.080 align:start position:0%
that is how I understand it sir yes
 
04:50:28.910 --> 04:50:28.920 align:start position:0%
thank a representative Katon and then
 
04:50:32.190 --> 04:50:32.200 align:start position:0%
represent Murray okay just just to make
 
04:50:34.230 --> 04:50:34.240 align:start position:0%
sure I'm clear because I'm done with
 
04:50:36.470 --> 04:50:36.480 align:start position:0%
this this bill is not necessary because
 
04:50:38.390 --> 04:50:38.400 align:start position:0%
she can already already do
 
04:50:41.548 --> 04:50:41.558 align:start position:0%
it that is how I would understand it yes
 
04:50:44.350 --> 04:50:44.360 align:start position:0%
okay and is it can I follow follow up
 
04:50:46.830 --> 04:50:46.840 align:start position:0%
sure yeah and can you give your number
 
04:50:50.230 --> 04:50:50.240 align:start position:0%
to him so that he can call you and or
 
04:50:52.910 --> 04:50:52.920 align:start position:0%
she can call you and square it away is
 
04:50:55.110 --> 04:50:55.120 align:start position:0%
that possible that's 100% possible thank
 
04:50:56.548 --> 04:50:56.558 align:start position:0%
you sir appreciate thank you
 
04:50:56.558 --> 04:50:57.948 align:start position:0%
you sir appreciate thank you
representative

04:50:57.948 --> 04:50:57.958 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:51:00.628 --> 04:51:00.638 align:start position:0%
Murray thank you madam chair and and and
 
04:51:03.110 --> 04:51:03.120 align:start position:0%
to the member's Point um with regard to
 
04:51:04.470 --> 04:51:04.480 align:start position:0%
whether or not I there might be a
 
04:51:06.830 --> 04:51:06.840 align:start position:0%
circumstance in I don't know the
 
04:51:08.350 --> 04:51:08.360 align:start position:0%
business's circumstance of whether or
 
04:51:09.868 --> 04:51:09.878 align:start position:0%
not they're seeking
 
04:51:13.628 --> 04:51:13.638 align:start position:0%
wholesale and if that's the case um it's
 
04:51:16.270 --> 04:51:16.280 align:start position:0%
possible that their machine already does
 
04:51:17.708 --> 04:51:17.718 align:start position:0%
this and they're just
 
04:51:20.628 --> 04:51:20.638 align:start position:0%
not communicating that effectively
 
04:51:21.990 --> 04:51:22.000 align:start position:0%
because there are machines out there
 
04:51:25.110 --> 04:51:25.120 align:start position:0%
that do that process heat it for the
 
04:51:27.230 --> 04:51:27.240 align:start position:0%
appropriate amount of time and then cool
 
04:51:29.510 --> 04:51:29.520 align:start position:0%
it is that correct am I understanding
 
04:51:32.590 --> 04:51:32.600 align:start position:0%
that correct that is correct the caveat
 
04:51:34.030 --> 04:51:34.040 align:start position:0%
that I will throw out there just for
 
04:51:35.990 --> 04:51:36.000 align:start position:0%
full disclosure is a lot of them that
 
04:51:39.350 --> 04:51:39.360 align:start position:0%
are advertised that are more homebased
 
04:51:41.430 --> 04:51:41.440 align:start position:0%
would not meet our rules for the
 
04:51:43.070 --> 04:51:43.080 align:start position:0%
pasteurizer so I don't want to leave the
 
04:51:44.788 --> 04:51:44.798 align:start position:0%
committee with an understanding that
 
04:51:46.868 --> 04:51:46.878 align:start position:0%
just because a homebased unit touts that
 
04:51:49.750 --> 04:51:49.760 align:start position:0%
it Cooks it that it would meet the
 
04:51:52.868 --> 04:51:52.878 align:start position:0%
regulations that we have in place um but
 
04:51:55.510 --> 04:51:55.520 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of small pasteurizers
 
04:51:57.470 --> 04:51:57.480 align:start position:0%
out there the smallest that I have
 
04:52:00.548 --> 04:52:00.558 align:start position:0%
personally tested was a two gallon stove
 
04:52:02.190 --> 04:52:02.200 align:start position:0%
top unit that met the rules and
 
04:52:04.590 --> 04:52:04.600 align:start position:0%
regulations so they go down as low as
 
04:52:07.070 --> 04:52:07.080 align:start position:0%
two gallons and I've seen 2,000 gallon
 
04:52:10.830 --> 04:52:10.840 align:start position:0%
on so I think you know it runs
 
04:52:15.070 --> 04:52:15.080 align:start position:0%
again do you know how much those cost at
 
04:52:18.830 --> 04:52:18.840 align:start position:0%
all um the very small ones no the
 
04:52:20.990 --> 04:52:21.000 align:start position:0%
midsize ones that are very popular with
 
04:52:25.948 --> 04:52:25.958 align:start position:0%
our goat Farmers um probably are running
 
04:52:29.868 --> 04:52:29.878 align:start position:0%
above 10,000 the tabletop ones I suspect
 
04:52:31.708 --> 04:52:31.718 align:start position:0%
are a whole lot less because they just
 
04:52:34.910 --> 04:52:34.920 align:start position:0%
don't have um as much built into them
 
04:52:37.150 --> 04:52:37.160 align:start position:0%
but they the manufacturer knew what the
 
04:52:40.270 --> 04:52:40.280 align:start position:0%
rules were for across the 50 states that
 
04:52:41.708 --> 04:52:41.718 align:start position:0%
they want to sell them in and so they
 
04:52:43.868 --> 04:52:43.878 align:start position:0%
built it with that in
 
04:52:46.070 --> 04:52:46.080 align:start position:0%
mind okay thank
 
04:52:49.990 --> 04:52:50.000 align:start position:0%
you no it's just I'm just you know for
 
04:52:51.868 --> 04:52:51.878 align:start position:0%
the farmer what it would cost them I
 
04:52:53.670 --> 04:52:53.680 align:start position:0%
don't know representative ger you have a
 
04:52:55.548 --> 04:52:55.558 align:start position:0%
question I do thank you madam chair and
 
04:52:57.990 --> 04:52:58.000 align:start position:0%
this is more for my edification as
 
04:52:59.470 --> 04:52:59.480 align:start position:0%
supposed to anything else and because
 
04:53:00.708 --> 04:53:00.718 align:start position:0%
I'm curious about the language of the
 
04:53:02.110 --> 04:53:02.120 align:start position:0%
bill which it sounds like is not
 
04:53:04.150 --> 04:53:04.160 align:start position:0%
necessary anyway but with reference to
 
04:53:06.430 --> 04:53:06.440 align:start position:0%
the difference between resale and
 
04:53:10.270 --> 04:53:10.280 align:start position:0%
wholesale um sales uh the bill refers to
 
04:53:12.190 --> 04:53:12.200 align:start position:0%
a food service
 
04:53:16.270 --> 04:53:16.280 align:start position:0%
establishment or retail food store right
 
04:53:18.470 --> 04:53:18.480 align:start position:0%
and so those two categories are separate
 
04:53:20.510 --> 04:53:20.520 align:start position:0%
from wholesale
 
04:53:22.590 --> 04:53:22.600 align:start position:0%
correct I I just wanted to clarify
 
04:53:23.470 --> 04:53:23.480 align:start position:0%
because we were talking about that
 
04:53:25.230 --> 04:53:25.240 align:start position:0%
differ so in this case this bill which
 
04:53:27.430 --> 04:53:27.440 align:start position:0%
would be particular to if it's an
 
04:53:30.430 --> 04:53:30.440 align:start position:0%
establishment or retail sale it's not
 
04:53:33.070 --> 04:53:33.080 align:start position:0%
necessary if wholesale was involved that
 
04:53:34.190 --> 04:53:34.200 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be covered covered by this bill
 
04:53:36.590 --> 04:53:36.600 align:start position:0%
anyway correct we do have just for
 
04:53:39.310 --> 04:53:39.320 align:start position:0%
clarification again we do have multiple
 
04:53:42.110 --> 04:53:42.120 align:start position:0%
retail restaurants that make their ice
 
04:53:43.910 --> 04:53:43.920 align:start position:0%
cream that originally started out just
 
04:53:46.390 --> 04:53:46.400 align:start position:0%
for their customers and so many people
 
04:53:48.190 --> 04:53:48.200 align:start position:0%
told them how good it was that they now
 
04:53:50.670 --> 04:53:50.680 align:start position:0%
wholesale it to other places so we have

to open up the exec session for hb1
 
04:56:27.708 --> 04:56:27.718 align:start position:0%
1578 uh do I hear a
 
04:56:31.868 --> 04:56:31.878 align:start position:0%
motion represent Biby yes I move that we
 
04:56:35.430 --> 04:56:35.440 align:start position:0%
I move that uh HB 1578 be an expedient
 
04:56:37.708 --> 04:56:37.718 align:start position:0%
to legislate representative kraton you
 
04:56:41.868 --> 04:56:41.878 align:start position:0%
have a second yes ma'am second okay uh
 
04:56:43.670 --> 04:56:43.680 align:start position:0%
any discussion on that
 
04:56:47.788 --> 04:56:47.798 align:start position:0%
bill seeing none uh on representative
 
04:56:50.230 --> 04:56:50.240 align:start position:0%
lety first of I'm sorry I didn't hear
 
04:56:53.590 --> 04:56:53.600 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby is it itl itl okay
 
04:56:58.070 --> 04:56:58.080 align:start position:0%
so um I I thought um the um Mr Trumble
 
04:57:00.430 --> 04:57:00.440 align:start position:0%
was very passionate about what he said
 
04:57:02.868 --> 04:57:02.878 align:start position:0%
and I was wondering if there was any way
 
04:57:06.948 --> 04:57:06.958 align:start position:0%
that we could amend the bill to be able
 
04:57:10.430 --> 04:57:10.440 align:start position:0%
to meet his requirements which was uh
 
04:57:12.430 --> 04:57:12.440 align:start position:0%
the the request to keep the standards
 
04:57:16.270 --> 04:57:16.280 align:start position:0%
for Organics or was that the whole issue
 
04:57:18.230 --> 04:57:18.240 align:start position:0%
with the definition of Organics that we
 
04:57:20.670 --> 04:57:20.680 align:start position:0%
can't have it in statute anyway so so
 
04:57:24.350 --> 04:57:24.360 align:start position:0%
okay so so then disregard my comment
 
04:57:27.788 --> 04:57:27.798 align:start position:0%
okay um so represent
 
04:57:29.910 --> 04:57:29.920 align:start position:0%
n thank you madam chair I did think
 
04:57:31.310 --> 04:57:31.320 align:start position:0%
there was another piece beforehand that
 
04:57:32.868 --> 04:57:32.878 align:start position:0%
we said we were going to keep in there
 
04:57:37.390 --> 04:57:37.400 align:start position:0%
and um oh okay so um there was language
 
04:57:38.230 --> 04:57:38.240 align:start position:0%
that and I think it was you
 
04:57:40.470 --> 04:57:40.480 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby that mentioned okay
 
04:57:45.310 --> 04:57:45.320 align:start position:0%
so so um this would be an issue only if
 
04:57:47.548 --> 04:57:47.558 align:start position:0%
we passed the
 
04:57:51.390 --> 04:57:51.400 align:start position:0%
bill okay so there oh okay sorry I am a
 
04:57:55.750 --> 04:57:55.760 align:start position:0%
little okay so there so just a got it
 
04:57:57.590 --> 04:57:57.600 align:start position:0%
quick clarification there are a number
 
04:58:00.390 --> 04:58:00.400 align:start position:0%
of things that HB
 
04:58:05.470 --> 04:58:05.480 align:start position:0%
1578 uh was repealing many of them were
 
04:58:09.430 --> 04:58:09.440 align:start position:0%
were also repealed by uh 1628 which we
 
04:58:11.788 --> 04:58:11.798 align:start position:0%
heard this morning
 
04:58:14.750 --> 04:58:14.760 align:start position:0%
and the only one the only things that
 
04:58:16.628 --> 04:58:16.638 align:start position:0%
were not repealed by
 
04:58:22.270 --> 04:58:22.280 align:start position:0%
1678 or 15 1628 were the um
 
04:58:26.190 --> 04:58:26.200 align:start position:0%
authorization for uh the department to
 
04:58:29.470 --> 04:58:29.480 align:start position:0%
have a certification program and the
 
04:58:32.390 --> 04:58:32.400 align:start position:0%
authorization for the Department to do
 
04:58:35.590 --> 04:58:35.600 align:start position:0%
any rule Mak making in chapter 5
 
04:58:41.390 --> 04:58:41.400 align:start position:0%
426 and the uh Ru making is
 
04:58:45.030 --> 04:58:45.040 align:start position:0%
so uh probably the most important reason
 
04:58:49.670 --> 04:58:49.680 align:start position:0%
to itl HB 1578 is because it would
 
04:58:52.070 --> 04:58:52.080 align:start position:0%
redundant it would well it would it's
 
04:58:54.390 --> 04:58:54.400 align:start position:0%
well yes it's redundant but the worst
 
04:58:56.310 --> 04:58:56.320 align:start position:0%
thing about it is that it repeals rule
 
04:58:58.150 --> 04:58:58.160 align:start position:0%
making for the entire
 
04:59:00.070 --> 04:59:00.080 align:start position:0%
chapter and we don't want to get rid of
 
04:59:02.350 --> 04:59:02.360 align:start position:0%
the entire chapter or hamstring the
 
04:59:04.670 --> 04:59:04.680 align:start position:0%
department on
 
04:59:06.910 --> 04:59:06.920 align:start position:0%

do the hearing and um we'll we'll finish
 
05:05:13.990 --> 05:05:14.000 align:start position:0%
up with the rest so I'm going to open up
 
05:05:18.628 --> 05:05:18.638 align:start position:0%
the hearing for HB 1574 removing
 
05:05:21.230 --> 05:05:21.240 align:start position:0%
regulations on the direct sale of raw
 
05:05:23.590 --> 05:05:23.600 align:start position:0%
milk to
 
05:05:27.830 --> 05:05:27.840 align:start position:0%
Consumers and let's see
 
05:05:31.590 --> 05:05:31.600 align:start position:0%
1574 representative Granger was the
 
05:05:33.150 --> 05:05:33.160 align:start position:0%
sponsor of this
 
05:05:36.350 --> 05:05:36.360 align:start position:0%
Bill and as I look around the room there
 
05:05:39.110 --> 05:05:39.120 align:start position:0%
he is nowhere to be
 
05:05:46.030 --> 05:05:46.040 align:start position:0%
seen so um I guess I can introduce the
 
05:05:46.040 --> 05:05:48.070 align:start position:0%
seen so um I guess I can introduce the
bill

05:05:48.070 --> 05:05:48.080 align:start position:0%
bill
 
05:05:52.230 --> 05:05:52.240 align:start position:0%
um just basically uh what this bill does
 
05:05:57.590 --> 05:05:57.600 align:start position:0%
is it eliminates the 20 gallon raw milk
 
05:05:59.590 --> 05:05:59.600 align:start position:0%
um uh
 
05:06:05.230 --> 05:06:05.240 align:start position:0%
cap uh and it also uh eliminates the uh
 
05:06:08.670 --> 05:06:08.680 align:start position:0%
six fluid ounce restriction on frozen
 
05:06:11.990 --> 05:06:12.000 align:start position:0%
yogurt produced and sold in under the
 
05:06:15.430 --> 05:06:15.440 align:start position:0%
statute and that's all I know about
 
05:06:20.830 --> 05:06:20.840 align:start position:0%
this so um I do have some pink cards for
 
05:06:22.750 --> 05:06:22.760 align:start position:0%
folks who would like to speak on of
 
05:06:27.070 --> 05:06:27.080 align:start position:0%

a federation's policy director and we
 
05:06:52.390 --> 05:06:52.400 align:start position:0%

05:06:52.400 --> 05:06:55.788 align:start position:0%
are in in strong opposition to House
Bill

05:06:55.788 --> 05:06:55.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:58.750 --> 05:06:58.760 align:start position:0%
1574 as you may imagine we have members
 
05:07:01.750 --> 05:07:01.760 align:start position:0%
on both sides of the issue uh on this
 
05:07:05.910 --> 05:07:05.920 align:start position:0%
but our uh our commercial Dairy Farmers
 
05:07:08.910 --> 05:07:08.920 align:start position:0%
they have made uh huge investments in
 
05:07:12.948 --> 05:07:12.958 align:start position:0%
their operations it's their life work
 
05:07:15.430 --> 05:07:15.440 align:start position:0%
and they are very concerned with any
 
05:07:19.190 --> 05:07:19.200 align:start position:0%
type of negative publicity coming from a
 
05:07:23.390 --> 05:07:23.400 align:start position:0%
a uh a product that they spent their
 
05:07:26.150 --> 05:07:26.160 align:start position:0%
life's work selling product from another
 
05:07:29.990 --> 05:07:30.000 align:start position:0%
farmer that uh causes problems uh any
 
05:07:31.310 --> 05:07:31.320 align:start position:0%
type of health
 
05:07:31.320 --> 05:07:34.150 align:start position:0%
type of health
issues

05:07:34.150 --> 05:07:34.160 align:start position:0%
issues
 
05:07:37.070 --> 05:07:37.080 align:start position:0%
and I want to point out
 
05:07:41.390 --> 05:07:41.400 align:start position:0%
that in lines uh three and four uh that
 
05:07:44.708 --> 05:07:44.718 align:start position:0%
would strike the the uh sales limit of
 
05:07:47.868 --> 05:07:47.878 align:start position:0%
20 gallons if I'm remembering correctly
 
05:07:49.708 --> 05:07:49.718 align:start position:0%
I think it was back in
 
05:07:52.788 --> 05:07:52.798 align:start position:0%
2012 where we supported an increase in
 
05:07:55.150 --> 05:07:55.160 align:start position:0%
that limit from 5 to 20 gallons thinking
 
05:07:58.230 --> 05:07:58.240 align:start position:0%
it'd be a reasonable compromise uh that
 
05:07:59.910 --> 05:07:59.920 align:start position:0%
that number if you to give you an idea
 
05:08:02.868 --> 05:08:02.878 align:start position:0%
of how many how much 20 gallons is
 
05:08:04.868 --> 05:08:04.878 align:start position:0%
it's it's probably it's the production
 
05:08:07.590 --> 05:08:07.600 align:start position:0%
of I would say two very high producing
 
05:08:12.548 --> 05:08:12.558 align:start position:0%
cows depending on breed to uh to uh May
 
05:08:16.390 --> 05:08:16.400 align:start position:0%
four maybe five you know grade uh uh
 
05:08:20.510 --> 05:08:20.520 align:start position:0%
cows so we we think that that leaves uh
 
05:08:26.310 --> 05:08:26.320 align:start position:0%
a fair uh um a fair fair number Fair
 
05:08:29.270 --> 05:08:29.280 align:start position:0%
area for somebody who who wants to uh
 
05:08:33.070 --> 05:08:33.080 align:start position:0%
sell directly to a knowing uh consumer
 
05:08:35.310 --> 05:08:35.320 align:start position:0%
and then I want to point out the lines
 
05:08:38.350 --> 05:08:38.360 align:start position:0%
eight and nine that language that is
 
05:08:41.270 --> 05:08:41.280 align:start position:0%
struck that language became effective
 
05:08:44.750 --> 05:08:44.760 align:start position:0%
two years ago in in 2022 and as the
 
05:08:47.830 --> 05:08:47.840 align:start position:0%
chair knows there was a lot of work by a
 
05:08:50.470 --> 05:08:50.480 align:start position:0%
number of groups coming to compromise an
 
05:08:53.150 --> 05:08:53.160 align:start position:0%
agreement there to enable the the sale
 
05:08:55.350 --> 05:08:55.360 align:start position:0%
of raw milk ice cream and frozen yogurt
 
05:08:58.030 --> 05:08:58.040 align:start position:0%
and we we uh we don't see a need for any
 
05:09:01.190 --> 05:09:01.200 align:start position:0%
increase and would ask the committee
 
05:09:04.948 --> 05:09:04.958 align:start position:0%
again to to uh find this bill itl I I
 
05:09:06.548 --> 05:09:06.558 align:start position:0%
just want to add and I know you'll hear
 
05:09:08.948 --> 05:09:08.958 align:start position:0%
more from from the the the the
 
05:09:12.070 --> 05:09:12.080 align:start position:0%
department on on their concerns but um
 
05:09:13.788 --> 05:09:13.798 align:start position:0%
at Farm Bureau we also have SE we've
 
05:09:15.430 --> 05:09:15.440 align:start position:0%
seen both sides of the issue and mean
 
05:09:17.310 --> 05:09:17.320 align:start position:0%
and I say this and that on the insurance
 
05:09:20.990 --> 05:09:21.000 align:start position:0%
side uh we uh uh whole we used to own an
 
05:09:24.350 --> 05:09:24.360 align:start position:0%
insurance company and we a few years
 
05:09:27.350 --> 05:09:27.360 align:start position:0%
back when we were we were owners we had
 
05:09:32.190 --> 05:09:32.200 align:start position:0%
an issue where we had a um a issue with
 
05:09:36.190 --> 05:09:36.200 align:start position:0%
with uh consumers uh insured uh
 
05:09:39.510 --> 05:09:39.520 align:start position:0%
consuming uh raw milk in in and they and
 
05:09:41.510 --> 05:09:41.520 align:start position:0%
they experienced the maybe the worst
 
05:09:44.030 --> 05:09:44.040 align:start position:0%
case scenario where they ended up on
 
05:09:47.030 --> 05:09:47.040 align:start position:0%
dialysis and it was a huge expense for
 
05:09:50.670 --> 05:09:50.680 align:start position:0%
for our agency huge um and I'll just
 
05:09:53.750 --> 05:09:53.760 align:start position:0%
just kind of want to uh mention that and
 
05:09:57.190 --> 05:09:57.200 align:start position:0%
uh as always appreciate your time and
 
05:09:59.510 --> 05:09:59.520 align:start position:0%

thank you madam chair and thank you for
 
05:10:07.548 --> 05:10:07.558 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh would you think a
 
05:10:10.070 --> 05:10:10.080 align:start position:0%
modest increase to say 30 gallons would
 
05:10:10.080 --> 05:10:11.868 align:start position:0%
modest increase to say 30 gallons would
be

05:10:11.868 --> 05:10:11.878 align:start position:0%
be
 
05:10:14.948 --> 05:10:14.958 align:start position:0%
okay we haven't discussed that I I do
 
05:10:17.150 --> 05:10:17.160 align:start position:0%
think our our commercial folks would
 
05:10:20.070 --> 05:10:20.080 align:start position:0%
have some concerns I think they think 5
 
05:10:22.070 --> 05:10:22.080 align:start position:0%
to 20 I know was we had a lot of
 
05:10:23.788 --> 05:10:23.798 align:start position:0%
discussion at the time I think we're
 
05:10:25.390 --> 05:10:25.400 align:start position:0%
we're comfortable with where the the
 
05:10:27.270 --> 05:10:27.280 align:start position:0%
statue is that
 
05:10:30.830 --> 05:10:30.840 align:start position:0%
now yeah I am I just I touched base with
 
05:10:33.948 --> 05:10:33.958 align:start position:0%
Jill fidela who owns The Little Red Hen
 
05:10:36.350 --> 05:10:36.360 align:start position:0%
Farms um because she was involved in the
 
05:10:38.390 --> 05:10:38.400 align:start position:0%
conversations and I'd let her know about
 
05:10:41.110 --> 05:10:41.120 align:start position:0%
this particular bill as well and she
 
05:10:43.070 --> 05:10:43.080 align:start position:0%
indicated to me that you know she she
 
05:10:45.350 --> 05:10:45.360 align:start position:0%
wouldn't mind and then she was in that
 
05:10:47.110 --> 05:10:47.120 align:start position:0%
in those conversations that we had when
 
05:10:49.708 --> 05:10:49.718 align:start position:0%
we came to these this compromised
 
05:10:52.830 --> 05:10:52.840 align:start position:0%
language uh that's in statute now um
 
05:10:54.948 --> 05:10:54.958 align:start position:0%
that she wouldn't mind that it if it was
 
05:10:58.150 --> 05:10:58.160 align:start position:0%
raised to 30 gallons and and she would
 
05:11:01.510 --> 05:11:01.520 align:start position:0%
welcome um any kind of increase in the
 
05:11:05.470 --> 05:11:05.480 align:start position:0%
Frozen and yogurt uh ice cream as well
 
05:11:07.990 --> 05:11:08.000 align:start position:0%
to to be a little bit more than just the
 
05:11:10.110 --> 05:11:10.120 align:start position:0%
six fluid ounces because she's finding
 
05:11:12.788 --> 05:11:12.798 align:start position:0%
that the smaller cups are more difficult
 
05:11:14.470 --> 05:11:14.480 align:start position:0%
to deal with and it would have be nice
 
05:11:16.868 --> 05:11:16.878 align:start position:0%
to have a little bit more that they
 
05:11:19.430 --> 05:11:19.440 align:start position:0%
could put in a package so I'm just going
 
05:11:23.990 --> 05:11:24.000 align:start position:0%
to put that out there in terms of um I I
 
05:11:26.030 --> 05:11:26.040 align:start position:0%
don't want to I don't want to say formal
 
05:11:28.868 --> 05:11:28.878 align:start position:0%
testimony but just in her uh
 
05:11:31.788 --> 05:11:31.798 align:start position:0%
conversation with me about it and um we
 
05:11:34.270 --> 05:11:34.280 align:start position:0%
can can probably discuss this with the
 
05:11:37.628 --> 05:11:37.638 align:start position:0%
uh DHHS folks as well but I'm just
 
05:11:39.350 --> 05:11:39.360 align:start position:0%
putting that out there for you yeah
 
05:11:40.990 --> 05:11:41.000 align:start position:0%
thank you madam sh like I said we
 
05:11:43.708 --> 05:11:43.718 align:start position:0%
haven't discussed it internally I think
 
05:11:45.990 --> 05:11:46.000 align:start position:0%
our our Farmers would have concerns and
 
05:11:47.390 --> 05:11:47.400 align:start position:0%
if you did something like that we would
 
05:11:49.150 --> 05:11:49.160 align:start position:0%
ask you not to do it through amending
 
05:11:51.708 --> 05:11:51.718 align:start position:0%
this that new uh new bill be introduced
 
05:11:52.830 --> 05:11:52.840 align:start position:0%
and then we can have the discussion
 
05:11:55.270 --> 05:11:55.280 align:start position:0%
right right okay gotcha thank you any
 
05:11:55.280 --> 05:11:56.070 align:start position:0%
right right okay gotcha thank you any

for allowing us to speak on in
 
05:12:39.270 --> 05:12:39.280 align:start position:0%
opposition to House Bill
 
05:12:42.708 --> 05:12:42.718 align:start position:0%
1574 thank you I have written testimony
 
05:12:45.190 --> 05:12:45.200 align:start position:0%
which is being circulated but I will try
 
05:12:50.230 --> 05:12:50.240 align:start position:0%
to um summarize some of our major
 
05:12:54.948 --> 05:12:54.958 align:start position:0%
concerns raw milk has is has higher risk
 
05:12:58.830 --> 05:12:58.840 align:start position:0%
for foodborn illness eoli cryptosis
 
05:13:02.030 --> 05:13:02.040 align:start position:0%
seminol Aleria Brussel these are some of
 
05:13:03.628 --> 05:13:03.638 align:start position:0%
the microorganisms that have been
 
05:13:05.430 --> 05:13:05.440 align:start position:0%
associated with raw milk and raw milk
 
05:13:08.510 --> 05:13:08.520 align:start position:0%
outbreaks and unfortunately we we went
 
05:13:11.190 --> 05:13:11.200 align:start position:0%
through a a a major investigation of a
 
05:13:14.310 --> 05:13:14.320 align:start position:0%
raw milk outbreak in 2021 where 50
 
05:13:17.270 --> 05:13:17.280 align:start position:0%
people were sickened with cample actor
 
05:13:19.788 --> 05:13:19.798 align:start position:0%
um across three states and even a few
 
05:13:23.990 --> 05:13:24.000 align:start position:0%
pets um had consumed the the raw milk um
 
05:13:27.670 --> 05:13:27.680 align:start position:0%
we have we have seen increases in food
 
05:13:30.470 --> 05:13:30.480 align:start position:0%
born illness associated with raw milk
 
05:13:32.750 --> 05:13:32.760 align:start position:0%
and this is also a TR with other states
 
05:13:35.270 --> 05:13:35.280 align:start position:0%
that have that allow raw milk or raw
 
05:13:38.670 --> 05:13:38.680 align:start position:0%
milk products to be to be produced so we
 
05:13:41.310 --> 05:13:41.320 align:start position:0%
certainly have concerns about expansion
 
05:13:44.390 --> 05:13:44.400 align:start position:0%
for those reasons um and also as Mr
 
05:13:47.190 --> 05:13:47.200 align:start position:0%
Johnson pointed out is we also are
 
05:13:48.868 --> 05:13:48.878 align:start position:0%
protecting the reputation of our dairy
 
05:13:51.350 --> 05:13:51.360 align:start position:0%
industry and our Dairy Farmers and and
 
05:13:54.150 --> 05:13:54.160 align:start position:0%
any outbreaks asso associated with milk
 
05:13:56.430 --> 05:13:56.440 align:start position:0%
is very damaging to the industry as a
 
05:13:59.788 --> 05:13:59.798 align:start position:0%
whole um we also have concerns about
 
05:14:02.030 --> 05:14:02.040 align:start position:0%
removing that size limit that for the
 
05:14:04.270 --> 05:14:04.280 align:start position:0%
ice cream or frozen dessert product as
 
05:14:06.230 --> 05:14:06.240 align:start position:0%
this was put into place because these
 
05:14:08.390 --> 05:14:08.400 align:start position:0%
small manufacturers don't have
 
05:14:11.430 --> 05:14:11.440 align:start position:0%
commercial Blast chillers freezers to be
 
05:14:14.470 --> 05:14:14.480 align:start position:0%
able to effectively cool uh cool the
 
05:14:17.270 --> 05:14:17.280 align:start position:0%
product quickly um to R minimize that
 
05:14:19.510 --> 05:14:19.520 align:start position:0%
risk for bacteria to that may be present
 
05:14:22.230 --> 05:14:22.240 align:start position:0%
in that raw milk product to grow that
 
05:14:25.110 --> 05:14:25.120 align:start position:0%
was one of the in working in crafting
 
05:14:27.750 --> 05:14:27.760 align:start position:0%
that compromise to allow fro frozen
 
05:14:30.150 --> 05:14:30.160 align:start position:0%
desserts and Frozen ice cream to be sold
 
05:14:32.070 --> 05:14:32.080 align:start position:0%
that size limitation was very very very
 
05:14:34.270 --> 05:14:34.280 align:start position:0%
important for those that were involved
 
05:14:35.390 --> 05:14:35.400 align:start position:0%
so we would have definitely have
 
05:14:40.150 --> 05:14:40.160 align:start position:0%
concerns about removing that um and and
 
05:14:43.270 --> 05:14:43.280 align:start position:0%
finally the department is also concerned
 
05:14:45.110 --> 05:14:45.120 align:start position:0%
that this not only does this remove the
 
05:14:48.910 --> 05:14:48.920 align:start position:0%
limit but it also allows for any type of
 
05:14:51.070 --> 05:14:51.080 align:start position:0%
raw milk product to be produced and
 
05:14:53.310 --> 05:14:53.320 align:start position:0%
queso fresco type cheeses those are soft
 
05:14:55.310 --> 05:14:55.320 align:start position:0%
cheeses those are particularly
 
05:14:57.830 --> 05:14:57.840 align:start position:0%
vulnerable to outbreaks of leria that
 
05:14:59.230 --> 05:14:59.240 align:start position:0%
those would be allowed to be made in
 
05:15:01.030 --> 05:15:01.040 align:start position:0%
this instance so we we also have
 
05:15:03.350 --> 05:15:03.360 align:start position:0%
concerns about about removing the limits
 
05:15:04.910 --> 05:15:04.920 align:start position:0%
to the types of products that can be
 
05:15:07.548 --> 05:15:07.558 align:start position:0%
made with raw milk and and as we have
 
05:15:09.230 --> 05:15:09.240 align:start position:0%
mentioned before while there are
 
05:15:13.230 --> 05:15:13.240 align:start position:0%
labeling requirements um the we have
 
05:15:15.590 --> 05:15:15.600 align:start position:0%
very difficulty with enforcing those
 
05:15:17.350 --> 05:15:17.360 align:start position:0%
because the they're they're unlicensed
 
05:15:19.628 --> 05:15:19.638 align:start position:0%
they're unregulated for the most part by
 
05:15:22.270 --> 05:15:22.280 align:start position:0%
our department we we can we react to
 
05:15:24.628 --> 05:15:24.638 align:start position:0%
complaints of course but as far as
 
05:15:26.948 --> 05:15:26.958 align:start position:0%
regular inspection we we don't know that
 
05:15:29.190 --> 05:15:29.200 align:start position:0%
the if that's being done on a regular
 
05:15:31.868 --> 05:15:31.878 align:start position:0%
basis we don't know the the universe of
 
05:15:33.708 --> 05:15:33.718 align:start position:0%
raw milk producers because there's no
 
05:15:36.510 --> 05:15:36.520 align:start position:0%
registration there's no licensing so we
 
05:15:39.350 --> 05:15:39.360 align:start position:0%
um we have difficulty enforcing the
 
05:15:41.350 --> 05:15:41.360 align:start position:0%
statute and the limits it's very much in
 
05:15:44.070 --> 05:15:44.080 align:start position:0%
honor System as it is now 20 gallons a
 
05:15:46.590 --> 05:15:46.600 align:start position:0%
day is allowed um we can't tell you if
 
05:15:48.990 --> 05:15:49.000 align:start position:0%
maybe there's somebody making 25 it it's
 
05:15:50.990 --> 05:15:51.000 align:start position:0%
it's very much an honor System with
 
05:15:52.430 --> 05:15:52.440 align:start position:0%
those that are operating under the
 
05:15:55.470 --> 05:15:55.480 align:start position:0%
licensing and exemption uh we are happy
 
05:15:56.990 --> 05:15:57.000 align:start position:0%
to answer any questions that you may
 
05:15:59.750 --> 05:15:59.760 align:start position:0%
have for us thank you representative
 
05:16:02.390 --> 05:16:02.400 align:start position:0%
ktoa thank you madam chair and thank you
 
05:16:04.150 --> 05:16:04.160 align:start position:0%
for being here and for taking my
 
05:16:04.160 --> 05:16:06.430 align:start position:0%
for being here and for taking my
question

05:16:06.430 --> 05:16:06.440 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:16:09.350 --> 05:16:09.360 align:start position:0%
um it is my understanding and maybe you
 
05:16:12.070 --> 05:16:12.080 align:start position:0%
could clarify that one of the issues
 
05:16:15.110 --> 05:16:15.120 align:start position:0%
with increasing the size of the ice
 
05:16:17.948 --> 05:16:17.958 align:start position:0%
cream container is that it would be
 
05:16:20.628 --> 05:16:20.638 align:start position:0%
possible for something to remove that
 
05:16:24.910 --> 05:16:24.920 align:start position:0%
container eat some of it then refreeze
 
05:16:27.548 --> 05:16:27.558 align:start position:0%
it and the bacteria still stays in there
 
05:16:32.430 --> 05:16:32.440 align:start position:0%
and grows even in the freezer is is that
 
05:16:35.190 --> 05:16:35.200 align:start position:0%
correct yes yes that was also one of the
 
05:16:38.110 --> 05:16:38.120 align:start position:0%
reasons Not only was the the ability of
 
05:16:40.548 --> 05:16:40.558 align:start position:0%
a smaller producer to cool the original
 
05:16:43.070 --> 05:16:43.080 align:start position:0%
manufactured product but also that
 
05:16:45.310 --> 05:16:45.320 align:start position:0%
having a larger gallon siiz container if
 
05:16:47.350 --> 05:16:47.360 align:start position:0%
you will that might be taken out of a
 
05:16:49.708 --> 05:16:49.718 align:start position:0%
refrigerator or ref freezer and served
 
05:16:51.868 --> 05:16:51.878 align:start position:0%
and then put back in thought that there
 
05:16:53.948 --> 05:16:53.958 align:start position:0%
could be opportunities for bacteria to
 
05:16:56.190 --> 05:16:56.200 align:start position:0%
grow in that instance representa come to
 
05:16:58.190 --> 05:16:58.200 align:start position:0%
our followup thank you madam chair and
 
05:17:00.470 --> 05:17:00.480 align:start position:0%
thank you again for taking my question
 
05:17:02.110 --> 05:17:02.120 align:start position:0%
um you said there was an outbreak in
 
05:17:04.628 --> 05:17:04.638 align:start position:0%
2020 could you speak to what the cause
 
05:17:08.350 --> 05:17:08.360 align:start position:0%
of that outbreak was so the the
 
05:17:10.948 --> 05:17:10.958 align:start position:0%
determination that it would it was caor
 
05:17:13.350 --> 05:17:13.360 align:start position:0%
bacteria that was in that instance and
 
05:17:17.150 --> 05:17:17.160 align:start position:0%
we also want to point out is that that
 
05:17:18.990 --> 05:17:19.000 align:start position:0%
that the illnesses could have been much
 
05:17:21.470 --> 05:17:21.480 align:start position:0%
greater in that instance if it wasn't a
 
05:17:23.910 --> 05:17:23.920 align:start position:0%
very quick response by that particular
 
05:17:26.990 --> 05:17:27.000 align:start position:0%
Farm to not only notify the department
 
05:17:29.230 --> 05:17:29.240 align:start position:0%
of what was happening but also this
 
05:17:31.510 --> 05:17:31.520 align:start position:0%
particular farmer kept a customer log
 
05:17:33.868 --> 05:17:33.878 align:start position:0%
and was able to reach out to the
 
05:17:35.750 --> 05:17:35.760 align:start position:0%
specific people that they had
 
05:17:38.230 --> 05:17:38.240 align:start position:0%
distributed the milk product to so that
 
05:17:41.948 --> 05:17:41.958 align:start position:0%
also was um a very a situation that
 
05:17:43.910 --> 05:17:43.920 align:start position:0%
could have been a lot worse if it wasn't
 
05:17:45.990 --> 05:17:46.000 align:start position:0%
for that quick reaction of that farmer
 
05:17:48.670 --> 05:17:48.680 align:start position:0%
another followup thank you madam chair I
 
05:17:51.150 --> 05:17:51.160 align:start position:0%
I guess my question is is what caused
 
05:17:51.160 --> 05:17:52.230 align:start position:0%
I guess my question is is what caused
the

05:17:52.230 --> 05:17:52.240 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:17:55.150 --> 05:17:55.160 align:start position:0%
Campo the the illness to happen do you
 
05:17:59.030 --> 05:17:59.040 align:start position:0%
know so so you you want to take this one
 
05:18:00.470 --> 05:18:00.480 align:start position:0%
I don't know that we will know
 
05:18:00.480 --> 05:18:01.868 align:start position:0%
I don't know that we will know
definitively

05:18:01.868 --> 05:18:01.878 align:start position:0%
definitively
 
05:18:06.110 --> 05:18:06.120 align:start position:0%
um but the isolation of that was came
 
05:18:08.868 --> 05:18:08.878 align:start position:0%
from a single sample that we took from
 
05:18:12.628 --> 05:18:12.638 align:start position:0%
the farm that came from a single animal
 
05:18:14.628 --> 05:18:14.638 align:start position:0%
um that the farmer had said wasn't
 
05:18:18.830 --> 05:18:18.840 align:start position:0%
feeling well prior um so it's possible
 
05:18:20.868 --> 05:18:20.878 align:start position:0%
that that is the that the animal was
 
05:18:24.230 --> 05:18:24.240 align:start position:0%
sick and it shed into the milk um but
 
05:18:26.708 --> 05:18:26.718 align:start position:0%
it's it's a tough one to pick up and so
 
05:18:29.390 --> 05:18:29.400 align:start position:0%
it may not have been only from that
 
05:18:32.190 --> 05:18:32.200 align:start position:0%
individual cow U but we did test I don't
 
05:18:34.628 --> 05:18:34.638 align:start position:0%
remember the number of samples and the
 
05:18:36.868 --> 05:18:36.878 align:start position:0%
lab picked up the campy in that one at
 
05:18:38.750 --> 05:18:38.760 align:start position:0%
least in that one sample on that
 
05:18:40.868 --> 05:18:40.878 align:start position:0%
outbreak represent
 
05:18:45.310 --> 05:18:45.320 align:start position:0%
viby so um a number of years ago when we
 
05:18:48.708 --> 05:18:48.718 align:start position:0%
were discussing some other variation on
 
05:18:52.510 --> 05:18:52.520 align:start position:0%
uh on raw milk uh bills uh one of the
 
05:18:56.910 --> 05:18:56.920 align:start position:0%
things that uh you and and I think the
 
05:18:59.270 --> 05:18:59.280 align:start position:0%
your predecessor as director pointed out
 
05:19:03.670 --> 05:19:03.680 align:start position:0%
was that uh one of the pieces of logic
 
05:19:06.590 --> 05:19:06.600 align:start position:0%
with the small amount that's available
 
05:19:11.190 --> 05:19:11.200 align:start position:0%
small um small allowance is that by
 
05:19:13.910 --> 05:19:13.920 align:start position:0%
keeping it small it constrains the
 
05:19:17.030 --> 05:19:17.040 align:start position:0%
possible uh out the the possible reach
 
05:19:19.990 --> 05:19:20.000 align:start position:0%
of an outbreak is that something that um
 
05:19:23.948 --> 05:19:23.958 align:start position:0%
you could you elaborate a little bit on
 
05:19:27.708 --> 05:19:27.718 align:start position:0%
that know certainly that um the the
 
05:19:30.708 --> 05:19:30.718 align:start position:0%
wider distribution there there is more
 
05:19:34.310 --> 05:19:34.320 align:start position:0%
um Poss possibility of of a greater um
 
05:19:36.750 --> 05:19:36.760 align:start position:0%
outbreak in the instance that um the
 
05:19:39.110 --> 05:19:39.120 align:start position:0%
campor outbreak that we just talked
 
05:19:42.350 --> 05:19:42.360 align:start position:0%
about that farm had do you recall the
 
05:19:44.830 --> 05:19:44.840 align:start position:0%
exact number of cows that they were
 
05:19:47.590 --> 05:19:47.600 align:start position:0%
milking that farm was licensed with us
 
05:19:49.948 --> 05:19:49.958 align:start position:0%
as a raw milk producer and I believe it
 
05:19:52.670 --> 05:19:52.680 align:start position:0%
was milking maybe in the neighborhood of
 
05:19:57.830 --> 05:19:57.840 align:start position:0%
15 to 20 cows so for raw milk producer
 
05:20:00.430 --> 05:20:00.440 align:start position:0%
it was of a fairly decent size for what
 
05:20:01.868 --> 05:20:01.878 align:start position:0%
we see in New Hampshire because your
 
05:20:03.030 --> 05:20:03.040 align:start position:0%
bigger Farms are going to be the
 
05:20:04.830 --> 05:20:04.840 align:start position:0%
commercial ones that you would see
 
05:20:06.990 --> 05:20:07.000 align:start position:0%
shipping milk so but he was milking
 
05:20:10.590 --> 05:20:10.600 align:start position:0%
probably 15 to 20 cows represented Bixby
 
05:20:12.110 --> 05:20:12.120 align:start position:0%
yeah and just for
 
05:20:15.350 --> 05:20:15.360 align:start position:0%
clarification uh that farm and um and
 
05:20:16.830 --> 05:20:16.840 align:start position:0%
brookford farm would be another one that
 
05:20:19.510 --> 05:20:19.520 align:start position:0%
people might be familiar with uh are
 
05:20:21.350 --> 05:20:21.360 align:start position:0%
licensed which means they have an
 
05:20:24.910 --> 05:20:24.920 align:start position:0%
inspection routine and that's not this
 
05:20:26.708 --> 05:20:26.718 align:start position:0%
that wouldn't be the story that wouldn't
 
05:20:29.110 --> 05:20:29.120 align:start position:0%
be the case with the Farms that this
 
05:20:32.030 --> 05:20:32.040 align:start position:0%
bill is addressing that is correct this
 
05:20:34.070 --> 05:20:34.080 align:start position:0%
bill would El would exempt them from
 
05:20:36.788 --> 05:20:36.798 align:start position:0%
license share and then exempt from
 
05:20:38.708 --> 05:20:38.718 align:start position:0%
license share we don't do the
 
05:20:40.190 --> 05:20:40.200 align:start position:0%
inspections on those because we don't
 
05:20:42.190 --> 05:20:42.200 align:start position:0%
know who they are okay so followup
 
05:20:44.670 --> 05:20:44.680 align:start position:0%
followup so that could in fact make it
 
05:20:46.708 --> 05:20:46.718 align:start position:0%
more difficult to do the the rapid
 
05:20:49.390 --> 05:20:49.400 align:start position:0%
response that you did when the farm and
 
05:20:51.390 --> 05:20:51.400 align:start position:0%
Rollinsford had the
 
05:20:53.830 --> 05:20:53.840 align:start position:0%
problem I would say yes we would have to
 
05:20:55.990 --> 05:20:56.000 align:start position:0%
hear about it from you know once we
 
05:20:57.190 --> 05:20:57.200 align:start position:0%
heard about it we would start
 
05:20:58.590 --> 05:20:58.600 align:start position:0%
investigating but we would not
 
05:21:01.628 --> 05:21:01.638 align:start position:0%
necessarily have a relationship or know
 
05:21:04.390 --> 05:21:04.400 align:start position:0%
who they are in this case here as
 
05:21:06.948 --> 05:21:06.958 align:start position:0%
Colleen pointed out this farmer because
 
05:21:09.230 --> 05:21:09.240 align:start position:0%
we had that working relationship reached
 
05:21:11.990 --> 05:21:12.000 align:start position:0%
out to us over the weekend to let us
 
05:21:14.350 --> 05:21:14.360 align:start position:0%
know what he thought was happening so
 
05:21:16.510 --> 05:21:16.520 align:start position:0%
that we had a very quick by Monday
 
05:21:18.390 --> 05:21:18.400 align:start position:0%
morning we were already rolling with
 
05:21:20.230 --> 05:21:20.240 align:start position:0%
what we were going to do versus trying
 
05:21:22.470 --> 05:21:22.480 align:start position:0%
to get up to speed because we had that
 
05:21:24.150 --> 05:21:24.160 align:start position:0%
working relationship where we did
 
05:21:27.910 --> 05:21:27.920 align:start position:0%
inspections we did samples and
 
05:21:30.390 --> 05:21:30.400 align:start position:0%
whatnot thank you okay any other
 
05:21:32.030 --> 05:21:32.040 align:start position:0%
questions from the the
 
05:21:35.548 --> 05:21:35.558 align:start position:0%
committee NOP representative Howard
 
05:21:38.590 --> 05:21:38.600 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um is uh keeping a
 
05:21:42.150 --> 05:21:42.160 align:start position:0%
a customer list um routine practice or
 
05:21:44.548 --> 05:21:44.558 align:start position:0%
or recommended practice at at these um
 
05:21:45.830 --> 05:21:45.840 align:start position:0%
raw milk
 
05:21:48.310 --> 05:21:48.320 align:start position:0%
farms um it's probably recommended I
 
05:21:50.230 --> 05:21:50.240 align:start position:0%
would say most of the ones that I've had
 
05:21:53.190 --> 05:21:53.200 align:start position:0%
contact with Do It um because they want
 
05:21:54.868 --> 05:21:54.878 align:start position:0%
to be able to reach out to them if
 
05:21:56.750 --> 05:21:56.760 align:start position:0%
something new is coming up maybe not so
 
05:21:58.750 --> 05:21:58.760 align:start position:0%
much for thinking about an illness but
 
05:22:00.470 --> 05:22:00.480 align:start position:0%
more thinking about if they offer a new
 
05:22:02.628 --> 05:22:02.638 align:start position:0%
product or just they a lot of them will
 
05:22:05.150 --> 05:22:05.160 align:start position:0%
have like a monthly newsletter that they
 
05:22:07.270 --> 05:22:07.280 align:start position:0%
might want to send out so they do tend
 
05:22:09.190 --> 05:22:09.200 align:start position:0%
to keep a a lot of them I'm not going to
 
05:22:10.868 --> 05:22:10.878 align:start position:0%
say all of them by any stretch but a lot
 
05:22:13.948 --> 05:22:13.958 align:start position:0%
of them do keep a customer list some of
 
05:22:16.430 --> 05:22:16.440 align:start position:0%
them will even as you go and pick up
 
05:22:18.070 --> 05:22:18.080 align:start position:0%
your product because a lot of it is
 
05:22:19.510 --> 05:22:19.520 align:start position:0%
self-service so they might not be
 
05:22:21.910 --> 05:22:21.920 align:start position:0%
Manning a store like you would expect
 
05:22:24.150 --> 05:22:24.160 align:start position:0%
and the they asked the customer to write
 
05:22:28.310 --> 05:22:28.320 align:start position:0%
down you know 24 datee 24 I I bought two
 
05:22:30.788 --> 05:22:30.798 align:start position:0%
gallons of raw milk and paid the $6 or
 
05:22:32.990 --> 05:22:33.000 align:start position:0%
what what not so they track it that way
 
05:22:35.310 --> 05:22:35.320 align:start position:0%
um whether they capture everybody or not
 
05:22:37.868 --> 05:22:37.878 align:start position:0%
is I'm not sure um the other thing I'd
 
05:22:39.750 --> 05:22:39.760 align:start position:0%
like to say is I did not coordinate this
 
05:22:42.190 --> 05:22:42.200 align:start position:0%
with Rob but in case I was asked about
 
05:22:44.270 --> 05:22:44.280 align:start position:0%
20 gallons and how many cows that might
 
05:22:47.470 --> 05:22:47.480 align:start position:0%
be my number was four to five cows so we
 
05:22:50.830 --> 05:22:50.840 align:start position:0%
were very close on that um Just for
 
05:22:54.070 --> 05:22:54.080 align:start position:0%
information that limit does not is not
 
05:22:57.030 --> 05:22:57.040 align:start position:0%
species specific so that would be about
 
05:22:59.670 --> 05:22:59.680 align:start position:0%
a farm with 30 goats and about a farm
 
05:23:02.030 --> 05:23:02.040 align:start position:0%
with 80 sheep if you were staying within
 
05:23:04.350 --> 05:23:04.360 align:start position:0%
that 20 gallon limit and we do have
 
05:23:06.510 --> 05:23:06.520 align:start position:0%
sheep and goat farms that obviously are
 
05:23:08.270 --> 05:23:08.280 align:start position:0%
licensed and others that are not within
 
05:23:08.280 --> 05:23:10.628 align:start position:0%
licensed and others that are not within
the

05:23:10.628 --> 05:23:10.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:13.948 --> 05:23:13.958 align:start position:0%
state okay so four to five if two 20
 
05:23:16.548 --> 05:23:16.558 align:start position:0%
gallons is four to five cows four to
 
05:23:19.190 --> 05:23:19.200 align:start position:0%
five depending on breed and depending on
 
05:23:22.628 --> 05:23:22.638 align:start position:0%
how you feed them right and or 30 goats
 
05:23:24.910 --> 05:23:24.920 align:start position:0%
approximately 30 goats uh or
 
05:23:26.868 --> 05:23:26.878 align:start position:0%
approximately 80 sheep 80 sheep correct
 
05:23:29.430 --> 05:23:29.440 align:start position:0%
to get to the same 20
 
05:23:31.510 --> 05:23:31.520 align:start position:0%
gallons that's a lot
 
05:23:36.030 --> 05:23:36.040 align:start position:0%
yeah right okay thank you right
 
05:23:41.788 --> 05:23:41.798 align:start position:0%
um all right any other questions for
 
05:23:45.628 --> 05:23:45.638 align:start position:0%
DHHS seeing none thank you very much for
 
05:23:47.430 --> 05:23:47.440 align:start position:0%
coming in educating
 
05:23:50.070 --> 05:23:50.080 align:start position:0%
us and we need the blue sheet anybody
 
05:23:53.390 --> 05:23:53.400 align:start position:0%
else want to speak on this see
 
05:23:59.788 --> 05:23:59.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:03.310 --> 05:24:03.320 align:start position:0%
uh it's seven and
 
05:24:07.110 --> 05:24:07.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:09.030 --> 05:24:09.040 align:start position:0%
support no
 
05:24:12.510 --> 05:24:12.520 align:start position:0%
online seven in support and three
 
05:24:15.390 --> 05:24:15.400 align:start position:0%
opposed online and then on the blue
 
05:24:18.470 --> 05:24:18.480 align:start position:0%
sheet we have one
 
05:24:20.628 --> 05:24:20.638 align:start position:0%
against and I'm going to close out the
 
05:24:26.430 --> 05:24:26.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:26.440 --> 05:24:29.750 align:start position:0%
 
1574

05:24:29.750 --> 05:24:29.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:29.760 --> 05:24:32.110 align:start position:0%
 
okay

05:24:32.110 --> 05:24:32.120 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:24:36.708 --> 05:24:36.718 align:start position:0%
um I want to entertain the idea of
 
05:24:39.110 --> 05:24:39.120 align:start position:0%
executing um hb1
 
05:24:41.788 --> 05:24:41.798 align:start position:0%
1529 which we just heard before relative
 
05:24:44.310 --> 05:24:44.320 align:start position:0%
to the use of unpasteurized eggs because
 
05:24:48.070 --> 05:24:48.080 align:start position:0%
it seemed a little clear to me that that
 
05:24:51.150 --> 05:24:51.160 align:start position:0%
legislation um wasn't necessary I would
 
05:24:53.070 --> 05:24:53.080 align:start position:0%
agree to that would you agree to that I
 
05:24:56.670 --> 05:24:56.680 align:start position:0%
mean I have an ex for that do you if you
 
05:24:59.110 --> 05:24:59.120 align:start position:0%
give me a minute I will go again okay
 
05:25:01.350 --> 05:25:01.360 align:start position:0%
we'll give you a minute does anybody
 
05:25:04.270 --> 05:25:04.280 align:start position:0%
um else have any issue
 
05:25:06.510 --> 05:25:06.520 align:start position:0%
with the egg
 
05:25:10.310 --> 05:25:10.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:12.868 --> 05:25:12.878 align:start position:0%
Bill are we interested in the raw milk
 
05:25:14.548 --> 05:25:14.558 align:start position:0%
bill at all we want to talk about that
 
05:25:17.110 --> 05:25:17.120 align:start position:0%
with the Fuller committee I think I
 
05:25:18.788 --> 05:25:18.798 align:start position:0%
think we might have a couple of members
 
05:25:20.948 --> 05:25:20.958 align:start position:0%
who might have might want to weigh in
 
05:25:23.430 --> 05:25:23.440 align:start position:0%
who aren't here I mean sure I I have a
 
05:25:25.270 --> 05:25:25.280 align:start position:0%
pretty strong feel where I want to go
 
05:25:30.390 --> 05:25:30.400 align:start position:0%
with it but yeah but but I think but I
 
05:25:33.910 --> 05:25:33.920 align:start position:0%
think that that in terms of maintaining
 
05:25:38.110 --> 05:25:38.120 align:start position:0%
sort of a a balance of input on the
 
05:25:40.310 --> 05:25:40.320 align:start position:0%
committee I think we should okay wait
 
05:25:41.830 --> 05:25:41.840 align:start position:0%
until some other members who might have
 
05:25:44.070 --> 05:25:44.080 align:start position:0%
different ideas no
 
05:25:46.548 --> 05:25:46.558 align:start position:0%
worries did we have basically the same
 
05:25:48.548 --> 05:25:48.558 align:start position:0%
bill last year wasn't it the same I
 
05:25:51.470 --> 05:25:51.480 align:start position:0%
remember the the the serving size for
 
05:25:54.470 --> 05:25:54.480 align:start position:0%
yogurt okay so ice cre the same
 
05:25:57.910 --> 05:25:57.920 align:start position:0%
basically what we had last year was the
 
05:26:00.750 --> 05:26:00.760 align:start position:0%
bill that put this into put it into
 
05:26:05.390 --> 05:26:05.400 align:start position:0%
statute the way it is now and that bill
 
05:26:08.150 --> 05:26:08.160 align:start position:0%
took three terms to get in
 
05:26:12.190 --> 05:26:12.200 align:start position:0%
place so I have absolutely no desire to
 
05:26:13.708 --> 05:26:13.718 align:start position:0%
mess with it because it took long enough
 
05:26:14.948 --> 05:26:14.958 align:start position:0%
to get it in
 
05:26:14.958 --> 05:26:23.590 align:start position:0%
to get it in
place

05:26:23.590 --> 05:26:23.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:26.110 --> 05:26:26.120 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah not two years ago last two
 
05:26:27.470 --> 05:26:27.480 align:start position:0%
because I remember the discussion about
 
05:26:30.230 --> 05:26:30.240 align:start position:0%
gallons of raw milk oh there may oh yeah
 
05:26:30.240 --> 05:26:33.430 align:start position:0%
gallons of raw milk oh there may oh yeah
May

05:26:33.430 --> 05:26:33.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:35.750 --> 05:26:35.760 align:start position:0%
was that was road because we had a
 
05:26:37.590 --> 05:26:37.600 align:start position:0%
former I believe maybe chair of this
 
05:26:38.990 --> 05:26:39.000 align:start position:0%
committee a member of this committee who
 
05:26:40.548 --> 05:26:40.558 align:start position:0%
had come in and he was originally gonna
 
05:26:42.430 --> 05:26:42.440 align:start position:0%
speak in favor of it and then he came up
 
05:26:45.110 --> 05:26:45.120 align:start position:0%
and said having listened to testimony oh
 
05:26:49.670 --> 05:26:49.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:52.750 --> 05:26:52.760 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah yeah exactly that was funny
 
05:26:54.430 --> 05:26:54.440 align:start position:0%
because he said I was gonna testify in
 
05:26:57.948 --> 05:26:57.958 align:start position:0%
favor they getting for and and I have
 
05:26:57.958 --> 05:26:59.510 align:start position:0%
favor they getting for and and I have
getting

05:26:59.510 --> 05:26:59.520 align:start position:0%
getting
 
05:27:03.030 --> 05:27:03.040 align:start position:0%
16 not T I think he probably hadn't read
 
05:27:03.040 --> 05:27:04.868 align:start position:0%
16 not T I think he probably hadn't read
it

05:27:04.868 --> 05:27:04.878 align:start position:0%
it
 
05:27:04.878 --> 05:27:06.990 align:start position:0%
it
carefully

05:27:06.990 --> 05:27:07.000 align:start position:0%
carefully
 
05:27:11.628 --> 05:27:11.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:16.708 --> 05:27:16.718 align:start position:0%
just wait no we're doing um 1529 1529
 
05:27:23.590 --> 05:27:23.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:27.230 --> 05:27:27.240 align:start position:0%
bill this because I think I think rep
 
05:27:28.750 --> 05:27:28.760 align:start position:0%
would be irritated if we did this
 
05:27:37.430 --> 05:27:37.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:38.788 --> 05:27:38.798 align:start position:0%
well if if someone wants to make motion
 
05:27:39.868 --> 05:27:39.878 align:start position:0%
I'll just write everything in the back
 
05:27:41.868 --> 05:27:41.878 align:start position:0%
for now we'll wait for the paper it's
 
05:27:43.670 --> 05:27:43.680 align:start position:0%
fine it's fine I've done it
 
05:27:47.708 --> 05:27:47.718 align:start position:0%
before okay um I think he something from
 
05:27:50.390 --> 05:27:50.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:53.310 --> 05:27:53.320 align:start position:0%

Motion representative
 
05:28:11.750 --> 05:28:11.760 align:start position:0%
NAB um I think we heard that this bill
 
05:28:14.868 --> 05:28:14.878 align:start position:0%
was unnecessary that it was um maybe a
 
05:28:16.628 --> 05:28:16.638 align:start position:0%
bit of a misunderstanding that the
 
05:28:18.150 --> 05:28:18.160 align:start position:0%
constituent believed that they could not
 
05:28:20.230 --> 05:28:20.240 align:start position:0%
use unpasteurized
 
05:28:23.510 --> 05:28:23.520 align:start position:0%

lot but some of the discussion on the
 
05:33:11.110 --> 05:33:11.120 align:start position:0%
house was not factually based and so my
 
05:33:13.590 --> 05:33:13.600 align:start position:0%
idea is to bring in the folks that
 
05:33:15.590 --> 05:33:15.600 align:start position:0%
actually know these things so we can
 
05:33:17.110 --> 05:33:17.120 align:start position:0%
have an open discussion it'll be who
 
05:33:18.548 --> 05:33:18.558 align:start position:0%
they who are they going to be speaking
 
05:33:20.868 --> 05:33:20.878 align:start position:0%
with in the so the invitation is out to
 
05:33:23.150 --> 05:33:23.160 align:start position:0%
the whole house and what's the date
 
05:33:25.628 --> 05:33:25.638 align:start position:0%
again on the second of April at
 
05:33:28.510 --> 05:33:28.520 align:start position:0%
noon and uh so we're inviting everyone
 
05:33:30.510 --> 05:33:30.520 align:start position:0%
we just got to nail down the room it'll
 
05:33:34.390 --> 05:33:34.400 align:start position:0%
be somewhere here in the lob and um it
 
05:33:36.670 --> 05:33:36.680 align:start position:0%
it's just an open discussion with some
 
05:33:37.948 --> 05:33:37.958 align:start position:0%
folks that are really doing a whole lot
 
05:33:41.070 --> 05:33:41.080 align:start position:0%
of work for us and I think we did them
 
05:33:43.708 --> 05:33:43.718 align:start position:0%
some disservice a couple weeks ago and
 
05:33:45.430 --> 05:33:45.440 align:start position:0%
so we're going to give them I just want
 
05:33:48.390 --> 05:33:48.400 align:start position:0%
to open the dialogue so that we know
 
05:33:50.150 --> 05:33:50.160 align:start position:0%
what they're doing and how we can help
 
05:33:51.948 --> 05:33:51.958 align:start position:0%
that's that's the biggest thing all
 
05:33:55.230 --> 05:33:55.240 align:start position:0%
right so with that I adjourn the meeting
 
05:33:58.390 --> 05:33:58.400 align:start position:0%
our meetings till next week we'll see
 
05:34:02.230 --> 05:34:02.240 align:start position:0%
you have uh have a good rest of the week
 
05:34:28.868 --> 05:34:28.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:28.878 --> 05:34:31.878 align:start position:0%
