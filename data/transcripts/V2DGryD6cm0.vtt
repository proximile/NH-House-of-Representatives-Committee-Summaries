um
 
00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:09.959 align:start position:0%
so this the this portion of that 104
 
00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:12.980 align:start position:0%
Acres was originally
 
00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 align:start position:0%
15 acres and this is just one 1.73
 
00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 align:start position:0%

Parcels together on Enterprise Drive
 
00:03:26.809 --> 00:03:26.819 align:start position:0%
which uh
 
00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:29.459 align:start position:0%
was the 15 Acres the parcel will be

conveyed with the following conditions
 
00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:33.420 align:start position:0%

precedent to uh closing access to the
 
00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 align:start position:0%
parcel will be through the abutting
 
00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220 align:start position:0%
parcels the state is retaining All
 
00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:48.140 align:start position:0%
rights of access from Enterprise Drive
 
00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 align:start position:0%
any future in
 
00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:53.580 align:start position:0%
uh future improvements will be in celery
 
00:03:57.589 --> 00:03:57.599 align:start position:0%
use only and uh the conveyance will
 
00:03:59.770 --> 00:03:59.780 align:start position:0%
include a reversionary clause
 
00:04:02.089 --> 00:04:02.099 align:start position:0%
should any of these conditions be
 
00:04:04.789 --> 00:04:04.799 align:start position:0%
breached a little bit more of a
 
00:04:07.009 --> 00:04:07.019 align:start position:0%
background Mr letizio approached the
 
00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:09.900 align:start position:0%
town in the state about a project he's
 
00:04:11.809 --> 00:04:11.819 align:start position:0%
acquiring the property he's actually
 
00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:14.040 align:start position:0%
going to donate half the parcel to the
 
00:04:16.189 --> 00:04:16.199 align:start position:0%
town of Windham which abuts the Indian
 
00:04:19.069 --> 00:04:19.079 align:start position:0%
Rock historical site and they're going
 
00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:21.959 align:start position:0%
to develop kind of uh Outdoor Classroom
 
00:04:24.969 --> 00:04:24.979 align:start position:0%
type setting to that
 
00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:28.680 align:start position:0%
so in order to make this happen the
 
00:04:31.189 --> 00:04:31.199 align:start position:0%
state has put such burdens on the
 
00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:33.960 align:start position:0%
property that it can only be it it's
 
00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:35.720 align:start position:0%
only got
 
00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:38.400 align:start position:0%
contributory value to either a budding
 
00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:41.520 align:start position:0%
parcel so there's no direct access they
 
00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:42.960 align:start position:0%
can't it's not like you can turn around
 
00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:44.880 align:start position:0%
and sell it
 
00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:45.530 align:start position:0%
and sell it
um

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:45.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:47.880 align:start position:0%
as an independent parcel to be developed
 
00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:50.040 align:start position:0%
separately it can only be
 
00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:50.810 align:start position:0%
separately it can only be
um

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:50.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:55.460 align:start position:0%
used for that purpose so the parcel was
 
00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:00.060 align:start position:0%
a praise to be as contributory value 73
 
00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:02.340 align:start position:0%
900 plus the Eleven Hundred Dollar
 
00:05:04.969 --> 00:05:04.979 align:start position:0%
administrative fee brings us to 75 000.
 
00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:07.320 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to take any questions sure
 
00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:11.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:14.460 align:start position:0%
if I could
 
00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:16.160 align:start position:0%
I don't remember
 
00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:20.160 align:start position:0%
transfers too often like this no not
 
00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:21.830 align:start position:0%
transfers too often like this no not
non-buildable

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:21.840 align:start position:0%
non-buildable
 
00:05:23.749 --> 00:05:23.759 align:start position:0%
um and I assume I'm not familiar with
 
00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:27.240 align:start position:0%
the proper air price Drive is a limited
 
00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:29.820 align:start position:0%
access road is it or it's just another
 
00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:33.840 align:start position:0%
class 5 Highway okay so it's all right
 
00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:35.940 align:start position:0%
no This was um
 
00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:37.670 align:start position:0%
