00:09:22.310 --> 00:09:22.320 align:start position:0%
Administrative Assistant uh you remember
 
00:09:23.990 --> 00:09:24.000 align:start position:0%
we had Lindsay
 
00:09:27.710 --> 00:09:27.720 align:start position:0%
and then prior to Lindsay we had Judy
 
00:09:30.410 --> 00:09:30.420 align:start position:0%
and but that now we're dating back
 
00:09:33.889 --> 00:09:33.899 align:start position:0%
14 years so so Karen
 
00:09:36.710 --> 00:09:36.720 align:start position:0%

and pardon me
 
00:09:53.030 --> 00:09:53.040 align:start position:0%
well she's taking Lindsay's position and
 
00:09:54.889 --> 00:09:54.899 align:start position:0%
you know Lindsay also had a number of
 
00:09:56.630 --> 00:09:56.640 align:start position:0%
other committees I don't think there's
 
00:09:59.090 --> 00:09:59.100 align:start position:0%
been a whole lot Karen what committees
 
00:10:01.790 --> 00:10:01.800 align:start position:0%

and so as you can see she's got biggies
 
00:10:12.769 --> 00:10:12.779 align:start position:0%

appointments visiting with grandkids
 
00:13:19.550 --> 00:13:19.560 align:start position:0%
babysitting whatever it might be all
 
00:13:21.949 --> 00:13:21.959 align:start position:0%
important so let me go down through some
 
00:13:24.590 --> 00:13:24.600 align:start position:0%
of the bills of course we have today 352
 
00:13:28.610 --> 00:13:28.620 align:start position:0%
505 151 all dealing with mental health
 
00:13:31.009 --> 00:13:31.019 align:start position:0%
we will have a follow-up meeting to this
 
00:13:36.470 --> 00:13:36.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:39.650 --> 00:13:39.660 align:start position:0%
now these are work work study groups we
 
00:13:41.810 --> 00:13:41.820 align:start position:0%
don't we're not taking action during a
 
00:13:45.170 --> 00:13:45.180 align:start position:0%

00:13:46.790 --> 00:13:46.800 align:start position:0%
committee work whether it be a committee
 
00:13:48.889 --> 00:13:48.899 align:start position:0%
the whole or a separate subcommittee

will be done later in November too
 
00:13:52.970 --> 00:13:52.980 align:start position:0%
approximately that and that's not a
 
00:13:54.829 --> 00:13:54.839 align:start position:0%
solid date yet but we have to have
 
00:13:57.230 --> 00:13:57.240 align:start position:0%
everything out by the 17th I believe
 
00:13:59.750 --> 00:13:59.760 align:start position:0%

00:14:02.449 --> 00:14:02.459 align:start position:0%

00:16:09.650 --> 00:16:09.660 align:start position:0%
be on October 12th at 10 o'clock that's
 
00:16:12.650 --> 00:16:12.660 align:start position:0%
where we have Fred bramonte the ex-ch
 
00:16:13.730 --> 00:16:13.740 align:start position:0%
chair of the State Board of Education
 
00:16:16.670 --> 00:16:16.680 align:start position:0%
coming in presenting the Draft rules for
 
00:16:18.710 --> 00:16:18.720 align:start position:0%
306 the minimum standards for public
 
00:16:21.910 --> 00:16:21.920 align:start position:0%
school approval that will be on October
 
00:16:24.590 --> 00:16:24.600 align:start position:0%
12th at 10 o'clock
 
00:16:28.189 --> 00:16:28.199 align:start position:0%
so on October 12th at 10 o'clock we will
 
00:16:31.069 --> 00:16:31.079 align:start position:0%
have those rules in the morning and then
 
00:16:32.810 --> 00:16:32.820 align:start position:0%
in the afternoon we'll follow up with
 
00:16:34.610 --> 00:16:34.620 align:start position:0%
meetings following up on where we are
 
00:16:34.620 --> 00:16:35.569 align:start position:0%
meetings following up on where we are
today

00:16:35.569 --> 00:16:35.579 align:start position:0%
today
 
00:16:37.430 --> 00:16:37.440 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
00:16:39.650 --> 00:16:39.660 align:start position:0%
yes representative Cornell is the
 
00:16:42.290 --> 00:16:42.300 align:start position:0%
presentation by Barbara Monte going to
 
00:16:43.970 --> 00:16:43.980 align:start position:0%
be different than the presentations that
 
00:16:46.069 --> 00:16:46.079 align:start position:0%
he's going around the state doing I hope
 
00:16:49.970 --> 00:16:49.980 align:start position:0%
it's different okay uh because I've done
 
00:16:52.610 --> 00:16:52.620 align:start position:0%
that we we I did it too I did it at
 
00:16:55.670 --> 00:16:55.680 align:start position:0%
Concord High School but uh there was a
 
00:16:58.610 --> 00:16:58.620 align:start position:0%
lot that he mentioned in fact it was
 
00:16:59.990 --> 00:17:00.000 align:start position:0%
really when he was at Concord High
 
00:17:02.449 --> 00:17:02.459 align:start position:0%
School he spoke to the draft proposal
 
00:17:06.169 --> 00:17:06.179 align:start position:0%
but there wasn't enough time to get into
 
00:17:09.530 --> 00:17:09.540 align:start position:0%
a thorough discussion on specific points
 
00:17:11.329 --> 00:17:11.339 align:start position:0%
and there's a lot of different things
 
00:17:13.970 --> 00:17:13.980 align:start position:0%
comp disease Mastery of this and the
 
00:17:16.789 --> 00:17:16.799 align:start position:0%
elements within the subject areas in 306
 
00:17:18.949 --> 00:17:18.959 align:start position:0%
that we didn't get into a discussion at
 
00:17:20.990 --> 00:17:21.000 align:start position:0%
all and which we need to do and there's
 
00:17:22.909 --> 00:17:22.919 align:start position:0%
other areas as well so yes
 
00:17:25.309 --> 00:17:25.319 align:start position:0%
representative like us
 
00:17:28.610 --> 00:17:28.620 align:start position:0%
wouldn't that be also live
 
00:17:31.370 --> 00:17:31.380 align:start position:0%
for those of us who are out of state to
 
00:17:34.010 --> 00:17:34.020 align:start position:0%
be able to watch it and maybe text some
 
00:17:37.789 --> 00:17:37.799 align:start position:0%
questions to somebody to ask it they it
 
00:17:39.950 --> 00:17:39.960 align:start position:0%
will be at committee Hall we we can have
 
00:17:41.570 --> 00:17:41.580 align:start position:0%
that happen that's everything else
 
00:17:43.250 --> 00:17:43.260 align:start position:0%
happens like that that doesn't seem to
 
00:17:45.950 --> 00:17:45.960 align:start position:0%
be a problem to me okay good so you
 
00:17:47.630 --> 00:17:47.640 align:start position:0%
could you know tap in that way but I
 
00:17:50.090 --> 00:17:50.100 align:start position:0%
think it's a good idea if if uh Fred
 
00:17:51.770 --> 00:17:51.780 align:start position:0%
bermont is going to be here that we try
 
00:17:53.990 --> 00:17:54.000 align:start position:0%
to make an effort to be here and follow
 
00:17:56.150 --> 00:17:56.160 align:start position:0%
up on each other's questions and delve
 
00:17:58.370 --> 00:17:58.380 align:start position:0%
into a dive in because we're coming
 
00:18:00.650 --> 00:18:00.660 align:start position:0%
through 306 rules are extremely
 
00:18:00.660 --> 00:18:02.029 align:start position:0%
through 306 rules are extremely
important

00:18:02.029 --> 00:18:02.039 align:start position:0%
important
 
00:18:05.930 --> 00:18:05.940 align:start position:0%
and the concept I'm I've always thought
 
00:18:08.450 --> 00:18:08.460 align:start position:0%
of and believe in Thoroughly is that
 
00:18:12.470 --> 00:18:12.480 align:start position:0%
state statute drives rules rules don't
 
00:18:15.049 --> 00:18:15.059 align:start position:0%
drive state statute
 
00:18:17.450 --> 00:18:17.460 align:start position:0%
and that's what we got to make sure that
 
00:18:19.850 --> 00:18:19.860 align:start position:0%
the rules are reflective of the intent
 
00:18:22.310 --> 00:18:22.320 align:start position:0%
and the the law that we have put in
 
00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:23.630 align:start position:0%
and the the law that we have put in
place

00:18:23.630 --> 00:18:23.640 align:start position:0%
place
 
00:18:26.690 --> 00:18:26.700 align:start position:0%
so that that is all the scheduling which
 
00:18:29.029 --> 00:18:29.039 align:start position:0%
we have to date there's a lot of other
 
00:18:30.350 --> 00:18:30.360 align:start position:0%
stuff going on committees and
 
00:18:32.870 --> 00:18:32.880 align:start position:0%
commissions however that's not our task
 
00:18:36.289 --> 00:18:36.299 align:start position:0%
here today so what I'd like to do is get
 
00:18:39.890 --> 00:18:39.900 align:start position:0%
into the three bills which we have down
 
00:18:43.310 --> 00:18:43.320 align:start position:0%
for today at this time 151 Senate Bill
 
00:18:46.750 --> 00:18:46.760 align:start position:0%
151 HB 505
 
00:18:51.490 --> 00:18:51.500 align:start position:0%
and HB 352.
 
00:18:53.750 --> 00:18:53.760 align:start position:0%
151 is relative to mental health
 
00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:55.210 align:start position:0%
151 is relative to mental health
education

00:18:55.210 --> 00:18:55.220 align:start position:0%
education
 
00:18:57.770 --> 00:18:57.780 align:start position:0%
505's relative comprehensive mental
 
00:19:00.409 --> 00:19:00.419 align:start position:0%
health education in schools and 352
 
00:19:03.110 --> 00:19:03.120 align:start position:0%
relative to excuse absences due to a
 
00:19:09.110 --> 00:19:09.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:11.390 --> 00:19:11.400 align:start position:0%
first one we'll take it as in the order
 
00:19:13.010 --> 00:19:13.020 align:start position:0%
that we had it on the
 
00:19:19.610 --> 00:19:19.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:22.370 --> 00:19:22.380 align:start position:0%
this is relative to excused absences due
 
00:19:25.610 --> 00:19:25.620 align:start position:0%
to a student's mental or Behavioral
 
00:19:25.620 --> 00:19:26.810 align:start position:0%
to a student's mental or Behavioral
Health

00:19:26.810 --> 00:19:26.820 align:start position:0%
Health
 
00:19:28.669 --> 00:19:28.679 align:start position:0%
and I think that what we ought to do
 
00:19:30.830 --> 00:19:30.840 align:start position:0%
because we're
 
00:19:32.930 --> 00:19:32.940 align:start position:0%
probably going to overlap in our
 
00:19:34.669 --> 00:19:34.679 align:start position:0%
discussion there's a lot of you know
 
00:19:36.650 --> 00:19:36.660 align:start position:0%
implications that one bill affects
 
00:19:39.650 --> 00:19:39.660 align:start position:0%
another one so that's that's good
 
00:19:42.710 --> 00:19:42.720 align:start position:0%
discussion so let's if you you're if
 
00:19:44.210 --> 00:19:44.220 align:start position:0%
you're driving home for example you say
 
00:19:45.590 --> 00:19:45.600 align:start position:0%
well I want to have a definition of
 
00:19:47.510 --> 00:19:47.520 align:start position:0%
mental health that could be relevant to
 
00:19:50.750 --> 00:19:50.760 align:start position:0%
any one of these bills and so so
 
00:19:54.049 --> 00:19:54.059 align:start position:0%
um don't be fearful of not presenting
 
00:19:55.669 --> 00:19:55.679 align:start position:0%
that question or that discussion just
 
00:19:57.049 --> 00:19:57.059 align:start position:0%
because we happen to be something on
 
00:19:59.750 --> 00:19:59.760 align:start position:0%
dealing with absences from school
 
00:20:05.990 --> 00:20:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:07.850 --> 00:20:07.860 align:start position:0%
yes represent Belcher
 
00:20:09.529 --> 00:20:09.539 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
00:20:11.630 --> 00:20:11.640 align:start position:0%
um on the surface there doesn't appear
 
00:20:13.549 --> 00:20:13.559 align:start position:0%
to be anything wrong with the idea of
 
00:20:15.289 --> 00:20:15.299 align:start position:0%
taking a mental health day if that's
 
00:20:18.529 --> 00:20:18.539 align:start position:0%
necessary uh and we've heard testimony
 
00:20:21.169 --> 00:20:21.179 align:start position:0%
previously on this that nothing in
 
00:20:24.230 --> 00:20:24.240 align:start position:0%
current law would prevent a student from
 
00:20:25.970 --> 00:20:25.980 align:start position:0%
taking a mental health day with the
 
00:20:27.549 --> 00:20:27.559 align:start position:0%
approval of parents if that's necessary
 
00:20:30.710 --> 00:20:30.720 align:start position:0%
my concern is that by explicitly putting
 
00:20:33.650 --> 00:20:33.660 align:start position:0%
this in law when it's already allowed it
 
00:20:36.370 --> 00:20:36.380 align:start position:0%
does nothing but perhaps incentivize
 
00:20:39.169 --> 00:20:39.179 align:start position:0%
people toward taking more time away from
 
00:20:41.470 --> 00:20:41.480 align:start position:0%
school it just doesn't seem necessary
 
00:20:43.909 --> 00:20:43.919 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:20:46.190 --> 00:20:46.200 align:start position:0%
yes represent cascaden
 
00:20:49.070 --> 00:20:49.080 align:start position:0%
I agree with representative Belcher
 
00:20:49.080 --> 00:20:50.270 align:start position:0%
I agree with representative Belcher
um

00:20:50.270 --> 00:20:50.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:52.970 --> 00:20:52.980 align:start position:0%
when a parent calls that their child is
 
00:20:52.980 --> 00:20:54.950 align:start position:0%
when a parent calls that their child is
absent

00:20:54.950 --> 00:20:54.960 align:start position:0%
absent
 
00:20:57.830 --> 00:20:57.840 align:start position:0%
nobody questions why and nobody needs to
 
00:21:00.169 --> 00:21:00.179 align:start position:0%
I mean a parent will write a note my
 
00:21:02.810 --> 00:21:02.820 align:start position:0%
child was sick today or if the parent
 
00:21:04.130 --> 00:21:04.140 align:start position:0%
has been working with the school
 
00:21:06.650 --> 00:21:06.660 align:start position:0%
consistently because the child does have
 
00:21:10.490 --> 00:21:10.500 align:start position:0%
a diagnosis then they're aware of it and
 
00:21:11.930 --> 00:21:11.940 align:start position:0%
I fear
 
00:21:14.090 --> 00:21:14.100 align:start position:0%
um that it opens the door
 
00:21:15.830 --> 00:21:15.840 align:start position:0%
for every teenager who doesn't want to
 
00:21:17.029 --> 00:21:17.039 align:start position:0%
get up in the morning for whatever
 
00:21:17.039 --> 00:21:18.350 align:start position:0%
get up in the morning for whatever
reason

00:21:18.350 --> 00:21:18.360 align:start position:0%
reason
 
00:21:18.360 --> 00:21:20.330 align:start position:0%
reason
so

00:21:20.330 --> 00:21:20.340 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:21:23.630 --> 00:21:23.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:23.640 --> 00:21:26.700 align:start position:0%
 
wow

00:21:26.700 --> 00:21:26.710 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:26.710 --> 00:21:31.010 align:start position:0%
 
[Laughter]

00:21:31.010 --> 00:21:31.020 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
00:21:32.810 --> 00:21:32.820 align:start position:0%
is there any further discussion on this
 
00:21:34.789 --> 00:21:34.799 align:start position:0%
represent patent no
 
00:21:38.149 --> 00:21:38.159 align:start position:0%
I guess my one concern was that what
 
00:21:41.330 --> 00:21:41.340 align:start position:0%
happens after the parent has called in
 
00:21:43.070 --> 00:21:43.080 align:start position:0%
and notified that the child is taking a
 
00:21:44.810 --> 00:21:44.820 align:start position:0%
mental health day if the child if they
 
00:21:46.250 --> 00:21:46.260 align:start position:0%
called in and said the kid is the
 
00:21:48.470 --> 00:21:48.480 align:start position:0%
student had a sore throat there might
 
00:21:50.510 --> 00:21:50.520 align:start position:0%
not be follow-up the student appears in
 
00:21:52.669 --> 00:21:52.679 align:start position:0%
school the next day but I think this
 
00:21:55.970 --> 00:21:55.980 align:start position:0%
might be a flag that the child would be
 
00:21:55.980 --> 00:21:56.690 align:start position:0%
might be a flag that the child would be
um

00:21:56.690 --> 00:21:56.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:58.669 --> 00:21:58.679 align:start position:0%
that the school would be thinking that
 
00:22:00.169 --> 00:22:00.179 align:start position:0%
the child needed further intervention
 
00:22:02.930 --> 00:22:02.940 align:start position:0%
that may or may not be necessary
 
00:22:04.669 --> 00:22:04.679 align:start position:0%
okay I do have a question for the
 
00:22:05.870 --> 00:22:05.880 align:start position:0%
committee I'd like to look at number
 
00:22:05.880 --> 00:22:07.190 align:start position:0%
committee I'd like to look at number
three

00:22:07.190 --> 00:22:07.200 align:start position:0%
three
 
00:22:09.230 --> 00:22:09.240 align:start position:0%
on on the bill which is new language
 
00:22:11.149 --> 00:22:11.159 align:start position:0%
students shall not have their grades
 
00:22:13.549 --> 00:22:13.559 align:start position:0%
adversely affected by a lack of class
 
00:22:15.350 --> 00:22:15.360 align:start position:0%
attendance or participation due to
 
00:22:17.390 --> 00:22:17.400 align:start position:0%
mental or behavioral health related
 
00:22:20.270 --> 00:22:20.280 align:start position:0%
excused absences
 
00:22:22.789 --> 00:22:22.799 align:start position:0%
there are a number of schools especially
 
00:22:25.909 --> 00:22:25.919 align:start position:0%
high schools saying that in fact my my
 
00:22:27.529 --> 00:22:27.539 align:start position:0%
grandkids are attending one right now
 
00:22:29.990 --> 00:22:30.000 align:start position:0%
not in the state but you have to be
 
00:22:33.950 --> 00:22:33.960 align:start position:0%
there X number of days to complete that
 
00:22:36.830 --> 00:22:36.840 align:start position:0%
course successfully whether you're out
 
00:22:38.690 --> 00:22:38.700 align:start position:0%
for mental health or you're out for
 
00:22:40.250 --> 00:22:40.260 align:start position:0%
medical reason if you're offering
 
00:22:41.810 --> 00:22:41.820 align:start position:0%
medical reason some kind you can get a
 
00:22:44.210 --> 00:22:44.220 align:start position:0%
50 a 504
 
00:22:47.810 --> 00:22:47.820 align:start position:0%
uh plan and supposedly get some support
 
00:22:52.310 --> 00:22:52.320 align:start position:0%
at home or get it online but are we
 
00:22:55.250 --> 00:22:55.260 align:start position:0%
giving a really open thing here which is
 
00:22:57.590 --> 00:22:57.600 align:start position:0%
going to recruit or create a issue for
 
00:23:00.409 --> 00:23:00.419 align:start position:0%
an instructor in a classroom to ensure
 
00:23:03.710 --> 00:23:03.720 align:start position:0%
that this student meets the competencies
 
00:23:07.190 --> 00:23:07.200 align:start position:0%
or the academic standards expected from
 
00:23:09.529 --> 00:23:09.539 align:start position:0%
this class
 
00:23:09.539 --> 00:23:11.210 align:start position:0%
this class
question

00:23:11.210 --> 00:23:11.220 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:23:13.610 --> 00:23:13.620 align:start position:0%
represent dry
 
00:23:15.890 --> 00:23:15.900 align:start position:0%
that was a good thank you um that was a
 
00:23:17.510 --> 00:23:17.520 align:start position:0%
good question I also wanted to just ask
 
00:23:20.990 --> 00:23:21.000 align:start position:0%
if one through four apply to people with
 
00:23:22.610 --> 00:23:22.620 align:start position:0%
a health
 
00:23:22.620 --> 00:23:26.529 align:start position:0%
a health
absence

00:23:26.529 --> 00:23:26.539 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:30.049 --> 00:23:30.059 align:start position:0%
yes represent Myler yeah I'd like to uh
 
00:23:32.390 --> 00:23:32.400 align:start position:0%
have a resident superintendent of the
 
00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:33.470 align:start position:0%
have a resident superintendent of the
schools

00:23:33.470 --> 00:23:33.480 align:start position:0%
schools
 
00:23:36.890 --> 00:23:36.900 align:start position:0%
respond to your question
 
00:23:39.590 --> 00:23:39.600 align:start position:0%
um as you as you look at the issue I
 
00:23:40.669 --> 00:23:40.679 align:start position:0%
mean it's one thing to have an
 
00:23:44.210 --> 00:23:44.220 align:start position:0%
incidental you know absence and I think
 
00:23:45.590 --> 00:23:45.600 align:start position:0%
it's quite another representative
 
00:23:47.270 --> 00:23:47.280 align:start position:0%
writing mentioned you know you got
 
00:23:50.090 --> 00:23:50.100 align:start position:0%
somebody who has a a medical issue that
 
00:23:52.909 --> 00:23:52.919 align:start position:0%
the school is aware of how how at least
 
00:23:54.830 --> 00:23:54.840 align:start position:0%
in the Berlin school system how did you
 
00:23:57.830 --> 00:23:57.840 align:start position:0%
handle this kind of uh these four these
 
00:23:59.870 --> 00:23:59.880 align:start position:0%
four issues represent Cascadia are you
 
00:24:03.130 --> 00:24:03.140 align:start position:0%
willing to take that question yes
 
00:24:05.990 --> 00:24:06.000 align:start position:0%
uh thank you
 
00:24:08.450 --> 00:24:08.460 align:start position:0%
um okay let me quickly scan these but
 
00:24:10.549 --> 00:24:10.559 align:start position:0%
every school has a policy already in
 
00:24:12.350 --> 00:24:12.360 align:start position:0%
place about what constitute excuse
 
00:24:14.570 --> 00:24:14.580 align:start position:0%
absence unexcused absence
 
00:24:17.690 --> 00:24:17.700 align:start position:0%
if there is someone that has a mental
 
00:24:20.330 --> 00:24:20.340 align:start position:0%
health condition under the you know is
 
00:24:23.330 --> 00:24:23.340 align:start position:0%
diagnosed by the dsm-4 manual but they
 
00:24:25.370 --> 00:24:25.380 align:start position:0%
might also have toxic stress they might
 
00:24:27.350 --> 00:24:27.360 align:start position:0%
also have PTSD
 
00:24:29.690 --> 00:24:29.700 align:start position:0%
all of those issues
 
00:24:31.909 --> 00:24:31.919 align:start position:0%
hopefully the parent has worked with the
 
00:24:36.250 --> 00:24:36.260 align:start position:0%
school to engage Staffing
 
00:24:39.529 --> 00:24:39.539 align:start position:0%
and support around that student
 
00:24:43.370 --> 00:24:43.380 align:start position:0%
so then potentially there could be a 504
 
00:24:45.970 --> 00:24:45.980 align:start position:0%
plan which is making accommodations
 
00:24:49.970 --> 00:24:49.980 align:start position:0%
under certain circumstances
 
00:24:52.310 --> 00:24:52.320 align:start position:0%
and that could be the case with a
 
00:24:52.320 --> 00:24:54.010 align:start position:0%
and that could be the case with a
particular

00:24:54.010 --> 00:24:54.020 align:start position:0%
particular
 
00:24:56.330 --> 00:24:56.340 align:start position:0%
situation that has mental or Behavioral
 
00:24:58.430 --> 00:24:58.440 align:start position:0%
Health that's diagnosed and then the
 
00:25:01.549 --> 00:25:01.559 align:start position:0%
school supports that with the parent
 
00:25:01.559 --> 00:25:03.590 align:start position:0%
school supports that with the parent
um

00:25:03.590 --> 00:25:03.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:06.169 --> 00:25:06.179 align:start position:0%
let me look to see what else so it
 
00:25:08.289 --> 00:25:08.299 align:start position:0%
doesn't matter really if it's physical
 
00:25:12.490 --> 00:25:12.500 align:start position:0%
illness or mental health or
 
00:25:14.890 --> 00:25:14.900 align:start position:0%
Behavioral Health
 
00:25:18.110 --> 00:25:18.120 align:start position:0%
accommodations can be made
 
00:25:20.570 --> 00:25:20.580 align:start position:0%
under the circumstances
 
00:25:23.029 --> 00:25:23.039 align:start position:0%
but it's a team effort no one person can
 
00:25:25.070 --> 00:25:25.080 align:start position:0%
make those decisions when there's a
 
00:25:27.769 --> 00:25:27.779 align:start position:0%
student that's in trauma can you give me
 
00:25:31.549 --> 00:25:31.559 align:start position:0%
a a a definition for what is mental
 
00:25:34.669 --> 00:25:34.679 align:start position:0%
health versus behavioral because this
 
00:25:38.750 --> 00:25:38.760 align:start position:0%
says mental or Behavioral Health
 
00:25:40.549 --> 00:25:40.559 align:start position:0%
is there a distinct difference there
 
00:25:43.190 --> 00:25:43.200 align:start position:0%
between those two topics and if so
 
00:25:47.090 --> 00:25:47.100 align:start position:0%
how are those diagnosed are they
 
00:25:49.430 --> 00:25:49.440 align:start position:0%
diagnosed by a professional that the
 
00:25:51.710 --> 00:25:51.720 align:start position:0%
parent is working with or is the parent
 
00:25:54.289 --> 00:25:54.299 align:start position:0%
diagnosing this
 
00:25:56.510 --> 00:25:56.520 align:start position:0%
no they are two different
 
00:25:56.520 --> 00:25:59.269 align:start position:0%
no they are two different
types of disorders

00:25:59.269 --> 00:25:59.279 align:start position:0%
types of disorders
 
00:26:02.289 --> 00:26:02.299 align:start position:0%
um somebody with a mental health
 
00:26:04.970 --> 00:26:04.980 align:start position:0%
disorder would be diagnosed by a
 
00:26:08.390 --> 00:26:08.400 align:start position:0%
psychologist or a psychiatrist it's very
 
00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:09.649 align:start position:0%
psychologist or a psychiatrist it's very
specific

00:26:09.649 --> 00:26:09.659 align:start position:0%
specific
 
00:26:13.730 --> 00:26:13.740 align:start position:0%
and they use the DSM-5 manual which is
 
00:26:16.850 --> 00:26:16.860 align:start position:0%
the list of mental health disorders I
 
00:26:18.350 --> 00:26:18.360 align:start position:0%
can't remember the formal title there
 
00:26:21.130 --> 00:26:21.140 align:start position:0%
are people here that know that title
 
00:26:25.250 --> 00:26:25.260 align:start position:0%
so if there is someone with a eating
 
00:26:28.490 --> 00:26:28.500 align:start position:0%
disorder if they're being treated they
 
00:26:30.950 --> 00:26:30.960 align:start position:0%
could have a mental health issue
 
00:26:33.830 --> 00:26:33.840 align:start position:0%
behavioral issue is someone who lives in
 
00:26:35.029 --> 00:26:35.039 align:start position:0%
a toxic
 
00:26:38.090 --> 00:26:38.100 align:start position:0%
environment the parents are drug users
 
00:26:40.010 --> 00:26:40.020 align:start position:0%
the kid comes to school there hasn't
 
00:26:42.350 --> 00:26:42.360 align:start position:0%
been any food he's going to act out or
 
00:26:44.210 --> 00:26:44.220 align:start position:0%
he's going to be introverted
 
00:26:46.549 --> 00:26:46.559 align:start position:0%
somebody who's experienced their house
 
00:26:48.350 --> 00:26:48.360 align:start position:0%
burned to the ground they lost
 
00:26:50.529 --> 00:26:50.539 align:start position:0%
everything that child my experience
 
00:26:53.090 --> 00:26:53.100 align:start position:0%
post-traumatic stress disorder
 
00:26:56.390 --> 00:26:56.400 align:start position:0%
so then they may act out over that and
 
00:26:57.590 --> 00:26:57.600 align:start position:0%
they might just look like they're
 
00:26:59.810 --> 00:26:59.820 align:start position:0%
naughty kid but they aren't because you
 
00:27:01.430 --> 00:27:01.440 align:start position:0%
have to delve deeper into social
 
00:27:03.049 --> 00:27:03.059 align:start position:0%
emotional learning
 
00:27:05.690 --> 00:27:05.700 align:start position:0%
to find out what is going on with these
 
00:27:08.690 --> 00:27:08.700 align:start position:0%
kids so no longer is the thought the
 
00:27:10.789 --> 00:27:10.799 align:start position:0%
kid's naughty in school
 
00:27:13.490 --> 00:27:13.500 align:start position:0%
give them a day of detention
 
00:27:16.430 --> 00:27:16.440 align:start position:0%
if a school is set up appropriately to
 
00:27:19.669 --> 00:27:19.679 align:start position:0%
be that safe environment
 
00:27:19.679 --> 00:27:20.269 align:start position:0%
be that safe environment
um

00:27:20.269 --> 00:27:20.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:24.289 --> 00:27:24.299 align:start position:0%
in a trauma sensitive School
 
00:27:26.510 --> 00:27:26.520 align:start position:0%
then all kids who have any type of
 
00:27:30.350 --> 00:27:30.360 align:start position:0%
behavior Outburst including a bully
 
00:27:33.830 --> 00:27:33.840 align:start position:0%
uh would get some type of scaffolding of
 
00:27:33.840 --> 00:27:34.970 align:start position:0%
uh would get some type of scaffolding of
support

00:27:34.970 --> 00:27:34.980 align:start position:0%
support
 
00:27:36.830 --> 00:27:36.840 align:start position:0%
so we don't segregate I don't separate
 
00:27:38.210 --> 00:27:38.220 align:start position:0%
Mental Health
 
00:27:43.029 --> 00:27:43.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:46.970 --> 00:27:46.980 align:start position:0%
so absences really depend on that team
 
00:27:49.970 --> 00:27:49.980 align:start position:0%
effort what can that child I mean I've
 
00:27:52.190 --> 00:27:52.200 align:start position:0%
had kids that haven't been able to come
 
00:27:54.049 --> 00:27:54.059 align:start position:0%
to morning classes for
 
00:27:57.130 --> 00:27:57.140 align:start position:0%
a behavioral or a mental health issue
 
00:28:00.710 --> 00:28:00.720 align:start position:0%
or an environmental issue that really is
 
00:28:02.810 --> 00:28:02.820 align:start position:0%
creating a struggle
 
00:28:05.269 --> 00:28:05.279 align:start position:0%
and so Alternatives and accommodations
 
00:28:08.149 --> 00:28:08.159 align:start position:0%
for them to access School are made
 
00:28:10.610 --> 00:28:10.620 align:start position:0%
specific for that student are there
 
00:28:13.450 --> 00:28:13.460 align:start position:0%
other questions for the superintendent
 
00:28:16.610 --> 00:28:16.620 align:start position:0%
representative leckis best going to you
 
00:28:17.690 --> 00:28:17.700 align:start position:0%
if you're willing to take the question
 
00:28:20.090 --> 00:28:20.100 align:start position:0%
from her did you signal out or make a
 
00:28:22.130 --> 00:28:22.140 align:start position:0%
difference between mental health
 
00:28:24.850 --> 00:28:24.860 align:start position:0%
illnesses and physical illnesses
 
00:28:27.769 --> 00:28:27.779 align:start position:0%
and why would one be different than the
 
00:28:27.779 --> 00:28:28.430 align:start position:0%
and why would one be different than the
other

00:28:28.430 --> 00:28:28.440 align:start position:0%
other
 
00:28:30.110 --> 00:28:30.120 align:start position:0%
I didn't hear the beginning of your
 
00:28:32.390 --> 00:28:32.400 align:start position:0%
questions did you did you make a
 
00:28:36.230 --> 00:28:36.240 align:start position:0%
difference between mental illnesses and
 
00:28:38.990 --> 00:28:39.000 align:start position:0%
physical illnesses
 
00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:39.890 align:start position:0%
physical illnesses
um

00:28:39.890 --> 00:28:39.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:28:44.269 --> 00:28:44.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:44.279 --> 00:28:46.370 align:start position:0%
 
no

00:28:46.370 --> 00:28:46.380 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:28:50.330 --> 00:28:50.340 align:start position:0%
no depends what the physical illness is
 
00:28:52.669 --> 00:28:52.679 align:start position:0%
they might have limitations
 
00:28:56.330 --> 00:28:56.340 align:start position:0%
um they might have capacity issues
 
00:28:59.210 --> 00:28:59.220 align:start position:0%
so no it's it's very it might have a
 
00:29:01.549 --> 00:29:01.559 align:start position:0%
crime disease and what they might have
 
00:29:03.110 --> 00:29:03.120 align:start position:0%
Lyme disease
 
00:29:05.450 --> 00:29:05.460 align:start position:0%
there might be debilitating they might
 
00:29:07.970 --> 00:29:07.980 align:start position:0%
yep I've had kids that have you know
 
00:29:10.730 --> 00:29:10.740 align:start position:0%
they have mono it can't be another rule
 
00:29:12.890 --> 00:29:12.900 align:start position:0%
so you got to phase that in you got to
 
00:29:15.549 --> 00:29:15.559 align:start position:0%
support them at home
 
00:29:18.289 --> 00:29:18.299 align:start position:0%
representative following up the word
 
00:29:21.289 --> 00:29:21.299 align:start position:0%
that I think uh represent Ruckus was as
 
00:29:24.110 --> 00:29:24.120 align:start position:0%
a prior Minister and principal myself
 
00:29:27.710 --> 00:29:27.720 align:start position:0%
we had a rule in the district that if
 
00:29:30.710 --> 00:29:30.720 align:start position:0%
you're going to be out five days or more
 
00:29:33.769 --> 00:29:33.779 align:start position:0%
and usually up after the fifth day you
 
00:29:36.769 --> 00:29:36.779 align:start position:0%
had have a doctor's certificate or some
 
00:29:39.409 --> 00:29:39.419 align:start position:0%
kind of uh communication from the
 
00:29:42.889 --> 00:29:42.899 align:start position:0%
psychiatrist which is also that level uh
 
00:29:45.950 --> 00:29:45.960 align:start position:0%
professional so that it's not abused and
 
00:29:48.590 --> 00:29:48.600 align:start position:0%
also to afford the school the
 
00:29:50.750 --> 00:29:50.760 align:start position:0%
opportunity if that student's going to
 
00:29:52.610 --> 00:29:52.620 align:start position:0%
be out for any extended time you can go
 
00:29:55.490 --> 00:29:55.500 align:start position:0%
down the route of a 504. absolutely
 
00:29:58.310 --> 00:29:58.320 align:start position:0%
so is there is it good to have some
 
00:30:01.190 --> 00:30:01.200 align:start position:0%
qualifying time limits on this otherwise
 
00:30:02.870 --> 00:30:02.880 align:start position:0%
can a person call in and say well I'm
 
00:30:04.909 --> 00:30:04.919 align:start position:0%
going to take a mental health week
 
00:30:07.370 --> 00:30:07.380 align:start position:0%
and I'm going with my folks down to
 
00:30:10.930 --> 00:30:10.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:13.430 --> 00:30:13.440 align:start position:0%
you know some doctors would write a note
 
00:30:15.830 --> 00:30:15.840 align:start position:0%
to excuse that because they need a
 
00:30:18.049 --> 00:30:18.059 align:start position:0%
mental health week but
 
00:30:20.149 --> 00:30:20.159 align:start position:0%
um don't worry that kind of stuff is not
 
00:30:21.529 --> 00:30:21.539 align:start position:0%
very secret
 
00:30:25.250 --> 00:30:25.260 align:start position:0%
I mean word gets out but it's but in
 
00:30:26.750 --> 00:30:26.760 align:start position:0%
your past history have you had that
 
00:30:28.610 --> 00:30:28.620 align:start position:0%
limitation of X number days then the
 
00:30:30.590 --> 00:30:30.600 align:start position:0%
school has the teacher has to received
 
00:30:34.070 --> 00:30:34.080 align:start position:0%
the note or the reason why the child is
 
00:30:37.029 --> 00:30:37.039 align:start position:0%
sick yes they have to have so many
 
00:30:41.830 --> 00:30:41.840 align:start position:0%
unexcused days versus excuse days
 
00:30:44.210 --> 00:30:44.220 align:start position:0%
and it sometimes it could take a long
 
00:30:46.970 --> 00:30:46.980 align:start position:0%
time to add up unexcused days and then
 
00:30:51.110 --> 00:30:51.120 align:start position:0%
you require a doctor's note yeah yeah
 
00:30:53.870 --> 00:30:53.880 align:start position:0%
yes rep person Damon
 
00:30:56.269 --> 00:30:56.279 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
00:30:58.850 --> 00:30:58.860 align:start position:0%
so I have a comment on a couple
 
00:31:02.450 --> 00:31:02.460 align:start position:0%
questions so the DSM that representing
 
00:31:04.330 --> 00:31:04.340 align:start position:0%
past cotton referred to just to
 
00:31:06.350 --> 00:31:06.360 align:start position:0%
clarifying that for folks who might know
 
00:31:08.990 --> 00:31:09.000 align:start position:0%
not know is the diagnostic and
 
00:31:11.269 --> 00:31:11.279 align:start position:0%
statistical manual it's in its fifth
 
00:31:13.970 --> 00:31:13.980 align:start position:0%
edition and it's basically the Bible of
 
00:31:16.909 --> 00:31:16.919 align:start position:0%
diagnosis of mental health conditions
 
00:31:19.250 --> 00:31:19.260 align:start position:0%
that's used by all Health Care
 
00:31:21.830 --> 00:31:21.840 align:start position:0%
Professionals it's very standardized and
 
00:31:21.840 --> 00:31:23.690 align:start position:0%
Professionals it's very standardized and
respected

00:31:23.690 --> 00:31:23.700 align:start position:0%
respected
 
00:31:23.700 --> 00:31:24.889 align:start position:0%
respected
um

00:31:24.889 --> 00:31:24.899 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:31:28.669 --> 00:31:28.679 align:start position:0%
some a question sometimes since my kids
 
00:31:31.669 --> 00:31:31.679 align:start position:0%
were in school and they happily weren't
 
00:31:34.549 --> 00:31:34.559 align:start position:0%
ill much in either way physical or
 
00:31:34.559 --> 00:31:35.810 align:start position:0%
ill much in either way physical or
mental

00:31:35.810 --> 00:31:35.820 align:start position:0%
mental
 
00:31:39.350 --> 00:31:39.360 align:start position:0%
currently if a parent calls to inform
 
00:31:41.210 --> 00:31:41.220 align:start position:0%
that their student will not be in school
 
00:31:50.029 --> 00:31:50.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:52.850 --> 00:31:52.860 align:start position:0%
so follow-up yeah so then the written
 
00:31:55.310 --> 00:31:55.320 align:start position:0%
note would need to stay a reason
 
00:31:57.769 --> 00:31:57.779 align:start position:0%
like what I'm asking is can a parent
 
00:32:01.010 --> 00:32:01.020 align:start position:0%
simply call and say Jane will not be in
 
00:32:02.930 --> 00:32:02.940 align:start position:0%
school today she's not well without
 
00:32:05.570 --> 00:32:05.580 align:start position:0%
being any further specific than that or
 
00:32:08.269 --> 00:32:08.279 align:start position:0%
do they need to be more specific when I
 
00:32:10.970 --> 00:32:10.980 align:start position:0%
was a principal
 
00:32:13.190 --> 00:32:13.200 align:start position:0%
um that was fine yeah
 
00:32:16.430 --> 00:32:16.440 align:start position:0%
uh for the parent calling fact we wanted
 
00:32:20.090 --> 00:32:20.100 align:start position:0%
that to occur but when it went longer
 
00:32:23.029 --> 00:32:23.039 align:start position:0%
beyond that five-day period then we had
 
00:32:26.690 --> 00:32:26.700 align:start position:0%
to you know get more specific and that's
 
00:32:28.549 --> 00:32:28.559 align:start position:0%
where we were asking for the
 
00:32:30.950 --> 00:32:30.960 align:start position:0%
recommendation or the statement from the
 
00:32:32.930 --> 00:32:32.940 align:start position:0%
MD or
 
00:32:36.169 --> 00:32:36.179 align:start position:0%
the counselor or whomever it might be
 
00:32:38.870 --> 00:32:38.880 align:start position:0%
one more follow-up yes
 
00:32:38.880 --> 00:32:40.669 align:start position:0%
one more follow-up yes
so

00:32:40.669 --> 00:32:40.679 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:32:43.190 --> 00:32:43.200 align:start position:0%
if there was the five-day absence and
 
00:32:45.769 --> 00:32:45.779 align:start position:0%
therefore the medical or psychiatric
 
00:32:48.230 --> 00:32:48.240 align:start position:0%
note needed
 
00:32:51.169 --> 00:32:51.179 align:start position:0%
if for whatever reason the family and or
 
00:32:53.750 --> 00:32:53.760 align:start position:0%
student does not want to share
 
00:32:56.930 --> 00:32:56.940 align:start position:0%
the diagnosis for the concern
 
00:33:00.830 --> 00:33:00.840 align:start position:0%
can that note simply say
 
00:33:02.769 --> 00:33:02.779 align:start position:0%
you know Dr Smith
 
00:33:05.269 --> 00:33:05.279 align:start position:0%
affirms that
 
00:33:08.029 --> 00:33:08.039 align:start position:0%
this student was not well enough to
 
00:33:11.990 --> 00:33:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:14.450 --> 00:33:14.460 align:start position:0%
as a principal I was never going to
 
00:33:14.460 --> 00:33:15.529 align:start position:0%
as a principal I was never going to
question

00:33:15.529 --> 00:33:15.539 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:33:18.769 --> 00:33:18.779 align:start position:0%
the professional statement written by MD
 
00:33:21.950 --> 00:33:21.960 align:start position:0%
that's not my bailiwick you know you
 
00:33:21.960 --> 00:33:22.669 align:start position:0%
that's not my bailiwick you know you
know

00:33:22.669 --> 00:33:22.679 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:33:25.430 --> 00:33:25.440 align:start position:0%
so I wouldn't question if I had a note
 
00:33:27.529 --> 00:33:27.539 align:start position:0%
from The Physician stating you know they
 
00:33:28.970 --> 00:33:28.980 align:start position:0%
scribble something down they've had a
 
00:33:31.669 --> 00:33:31.679 align:start position:0%
paper you can't read it anyways and and
 
00:33:33.950 --> 00:33:33.960 align:start position:0%
uh that's that's for me that was good
 
00:33:36.049 --> 00:33:36.059 align:start position:0%
enough we knew that there had been a
 
00:33:39.830 --> 00:33:39.840 align:start position:0%
diagnosis by a professional not just
 
00:33:44.389 --> 00:33:44.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:45.950 --> 00:33:45.960 align:start position:0%
I don't know if that's where you are a
 
00:33:47.930 --> 00:33:47.940 align:start position:0%
representative cascadden
 
00:33:49.130 --> 00:33:49.140 align:start position:0%
um yes
 
00:33:51.710 --> 00:33:51.720 align:start position:0%
um you don't question it and with a
 
00:33:54.350 --> 00:33:54.360 align:start position:0%
doctor's note the only thing is you
 
00:33:56.330 --> 00:33:56.340 align:start position:0%
always had a small pool of kids who were
 
00:33:58.190 --> 00:33:58.200 align:start position:0%
habitually absent
 
00:34:01.250 --> 00:34:01.260 align:start position:0%
in either the family or the the child
 
00:34:03.830 --> 00:34:03.840 align:start position:0%
had a connection in the school so they
 
00:34:06.169 --> 00:34:06.179 align:start position:0%
didn't have to explain to everybody
 
00:34:08.329 --> 00:34:08.339 align:start position:0%
maybe it's just a school nurse maybe
 
00:34:10.329 --> 00:34:10.339 align:start position:0%
it's just a school psychologist
 
00:34:13.490 --> 00:34:13.500 align:start position:0%
but people within the the institution
 
00:34:15.349 --> 00:34:15.359 align:start position:0%
would take that word for it without
 
00:34:17.930 --> 00:34:17.940 align:start position:0%
needing to know any details because some
 
00:34:20.750 --> 00:34:20.760 align:start position:0%
parents don't want that
 
00:34:20.760 --> 00:34:21.649 align:start position:0%
parents don't want that
um

00:34:21.649 --> 00:34:21.659 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:25.250 --> 00:34:25.260 align:start position:0%
there are very few times that there are
 
00:34:27.349 --> 00:34:27.359 align:start position:0%
truancy cases
 
00:34:31.909 --> 00:34:31.919 align:start position:0%
that are not masking Behavioral Health
 
00:34:36.349 --> 00:34:36.359 align:start position:0%
or some poor environmental situation
 
00:34:39.470 --> 00:34:39.480 align:start position:0%
um I've been to more houses to get kids
 
00:34:42.349 --> 00:34:42.359 align:start position:0%
in the morning from when I was a
 
00:34:45.530 --> 00:34:45.540 align:start position:0%
principal and a superintendent and
 
00:34:48.109 --> 00:34:48.119 align:start position:0%
um it's truly an eye-opener
 
00:34:50.210 --> 00:34:50.220 align:start position:0%
I visited too and I've been welcomed
 
00:34:53.030 --> 00:34:53.040 align:start position:0%
with a person with a rifle in their hand
 
00:34:55.010 --> 00:34:55.020 align:start position:0%
um but you know in in the case for
 
00:34:56.930 --> 00:34:56.940 align:start position:0%
example we had years and years ago we
 
00:34:58.790 --> 00:34:58.800 align:start position:0%
had a bill in here on concussion injury
 
00:35:01.430 --> 00:35:01.440 align:start position:0%
and we had folks from the NFL testifying
 
00:35:03.770 --> 00:35:03.780 align:start position:0%
as well as a young lady who had been in
 
00:35:06.109 --> 00:35:06.119 align:start position:0%
in college in Massachusetts had a
 
00:35:06.119 --> 00:35:07.130 align:start position:0%
in college in Massachusetts had a
concussion

00:35:07.130 --> 00:35:07.140 align:start position:0%
concussion
 
00:35:10.310 --> 00:35:10.320 align:start position:0%
and had be home in a dark area until
 
00:35:12.530 --> 00:35:12.540 align:start position:0%
this was healed that in that particular
 
00:35:15.829 --> 00:35:15.839 align:start position:0%
case you get the letter from the or the
 
00:35:17.510 --> 00:35:17.520 align:start position:0%
statement from The Physician but that's
 
00:35:19.310 --> 00:35:19.320 align:start position:0%
when you also take action at school
 
00:35:21.170 --> 00:35:21.180 align:start position:0%
saying how can we help how can we
 
00:35:24.230 --> 00:35:24.240 align:start position:0%
establish now the 504 plan yeah and and
 
00:35:27.410 --> 00:35:27.420 align:start position:0%
and get going on this so that's why I
 
00:35:28.790 --> 00:35:28.800 align:start position:0%
think it's necessary to get something
 
00:35:30.589 --> 00:35:30.599 align:start position:0%
from the doctor in case if it's going to
 
00:35:32.690 --> 00:35:32.700 align:start position:0%
be an extended period of time then it
 
00:35:35.150 --> 00:35:35.160 align:start position:0%
takes some time to get the person to go
 
00:35:37.130 --> 00:35:37.140 align:start position:0%
to you know to hire somebody to take
 
00:35:40.190 --> 00:35:40.200 align:start position:0%
care of that 504 yep yes representative
 
00:35:40.200 --> 00:35:41.870 align:start position:0%
care of that 504 yep yes representative
Balboni

00:35:41.870 --> 00:35:41.880 align:start position:0%
Balboni
 
00:35:43.430 --> 00:35:43.440 align:start position:0%
um this goes to exactly what you were
 
00:35:45.770 --> 00:35:45.780 align:start position:0%
talking about I just pulled up SEO 50s
 
00:35:45.780 --> 00:35:47.510 align:start position:0%
talking about I just pulled up SEO 50s
policy

00:35:47.510 --> 00:35:47.520 align:start position:0%
policy
 
00:35:50.150 --> 00:35:50.160 align:start position:0%
um and it and it states essentially what
 
00:35:51.770 --> 00:35:51.780 align:start position:0%
you are saying I think all districts are
 
00:35:54.109 --> 00:35:54.119 align:start position:0%
required to have a policy and it
 
00:35:56.089 --> 00:35:56.099 align:start position:0%
includes the definition of excused
 
00:35:59.210 --> 00:35:59.220 align:start position:0%
absences details uh
 
00:36:03.849 --> 00:36:03.859 align:start position:0%
um it talks about the after five days
 
00:36:06.410 --> 00:36:06.420 align:start position:0%
they'll look into it and it gives so
 
00:36:10.010 --> 00:36:10.020 align:start position:0%
it's very detailed laid out in in in
 
00:36:12.290 --> 00:36:12.300 align:start position:0%
what the expectations are for the school
 
00:36:12.300 --> 00:36:15.890 align:start position:0%
what the expectations are for the school
district

00:36:15.890 --> 00:36:15.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:18.349 --> 00:36:18.359 align:start position:0%
further discussion represent a hall
 
00:36:21.530 --> 00:36:21.540 align:start position:0%
thank you is there a from school to
 
00:36:23.210 --> 00:36:23.220 align:start position:0%
school district I realize everyone has
 
00:36:24.589 --> 00:36:24.599 align:start position:0%
to have a policy but from school
 
00:36:27.050 --> 00:36:27.060 align:start position:0%
district to school district does it vary
 
00:36:28.310 --> 00:36:28.320 align:start position:0%
a whole lot
 
00:36:31.190 --> 00:36:31.200 align:start position:0%
like what if a school district said five
 
00:36:33.050 --> 00:36:33.060 align:start position:0%
days and you particularly high school
 
00:36:34.609 --> 00:36:34.619 align:start position:0%
because it
 
00:36:36.349 --> 00:36:36.359 align:start position:0%
you know you got graduation that they're
 
00:36:37.970 --> 00:36:37.980 align:start position:0%
thinking about where the other schools
 
00:36:40.069 --> 00:36:40.079 align:start position:0%
not so much
 
00:36:42.530 --> 00:36:42.540 align:start position:0%
the graduation degree is issued by that
 
00:36:43.609 --> 00:36:43.619 align:start position:0%
High School
 
00:36:43.619 --> 00:36:45.050 align:start position:0%
High School
diploma

00:36:45.050 --> 00:36:45.060 align:start position:0%
diploma
 
00:36:47.210 --> 00:36:47.220 align:start position:0%
and of course they said all the
 
00:36:49.550 --> 00:36:49.560 align:start position:0%
boundaries parameters for issuing that
 
00:36:53.150 --> 00:36:53.160 align:start position:0%
diploma so I I I don't want to be
 
00:36:54.530 --> 00:36:54.540 align:start position:0%
subjective and answer that I can't
 
00:36:56.030 --> 00:36:56.040 align:start position:0%
because I don't know exactly what's
 
00:36:57.349 --> 00:36:57.359 align:start position:0%
going on throughout the state in this
 
00:37:00.170 --> 00:37:00.180 align:start position:0%
regard represent Tanner no excuse me
 
00:37:01.670 --> 00:37:01.680 align:start position:0%
represent cordelli first he had to stand
 
00:37:03.349 --> 00:37:03.359 align:start position:0%
up and then representative
 
00:37:04.849 --> 00:37:04.859 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:37:07.250 --> 00:37:07.260 align:start position:0%
um it seems to me with this legislation
 
00:37:08.710 --> 00:37:08.720 align:start position:0%
it would require
 
00:37:12.250 --> 00:37:12.260 align:start position:0%
a third category you have excused
 
00:37:16.690 --> 00:37:16.700 align:start position:0%
unexcused or mental Behavioral Health
 
00:37:20.089 --> 00:37:20.099 align:start position:0%
reasons for absences
 
00:37:24.230 --> 00:37:24.240 align:start position:0%
um because with this you it would seem
 
00:37:27.290 --> 00:37:27.300 align:start position:0%
that you have to track the number of
 
00:37:29.270 --> 00:37:29.280 align:start position:0%
mental health behavioral health days
 
00:37:31.790 --> 00:37:31.800 align:start position:0%
that they're absent because you want to
 
00:37:36.050 --> 00:37:36.060 align:start position:0%
make sure that it's not affecting their
 
00:37:38.930 --> 00:37:38.940 align:start position:0%
grading or anything else and it also
 
00:37:40.190 --> 00:37:40.200 align:start position:0%
opens the door as representative
 
00:37:41.890 --> 00:37:41.900 align:start position:0%
pedernal said
 
00:37:45.109 --> 00:37:45.119 align:start position:0%
for the school to start raising
 
00:37:47.030 --> 00:37:47.040 align:start position:0%
questions and it couldn't it doesn't
 
00:37:49.609 --> 00:37:49.619 align:start position:0%
have to be five consecutive days it
 
00:37:51.230 --> 00:37:51.240 align:start position:0%
could be you know a couple of days here
 
00:37:55.970 --> 00:37:55.980 align:start position:0%
a couple of days next month that
 
00:37:58.910 --> 00:37:58.920 align:start position:0%
um the reason is a quote mental health
 
00:38:02.750 --> 00:38:02.760 align:start position:0%
or Behavioral Health so I I think this
 
00:38:06.170 --> 00:38:06.180 align:start position:0%
for me this opens doors that I'm not
 
00:38:10.190 --> 00:38:10.200 align:start position:0%
sure I would want to go down
 
00:38:12.230 --> 00:38:12.240 align:start position:0%
forever Santana
 
00:38:15.170 --> 00:38:15.180 align:start position:0%
so like representative Balboni I looked
 
00:38:18.530 --> 00:38:18.540 align:start position:0%
up my District's um absentee policy and
 
00:38:20.930 --> 00:38:20.940 align:start position:0%
it's it's the same thing five five days
 
00:38:23.030 --> 00:38:23.040 align:start position:0%
and then there's some notification but
 
00:38:26.630 --> 00:38:26.640 align:start position:0%
it also uh has various categories for uh
 
00:38:29.450 --> 00:38:29.460 align:start position:0%
excused and unexcused absences and one
 
00:38:31.790 --> 00:38:31.800 align:start position:0%
of the excuses uh personal illness and
 
00:38:34.430 --> 00:38:34.440 align:start position:0%
in quotation marks it has mental or
 
00:38:36.230 --> 00:38:36.240 align:start position:0%
physical so
 
00:38:38.270 --> 00:38:38.280 align:start position:0%
um I think most of the schools are aware
 
00:38:41.390 --> 00:38:41.400 align:start position:0%
of that I know we had students that had
 
00:38:41.400 --> 00:38:41.990 align:start position:0%
of that I know we had students that had
um

00:38:41.990 --> 00:38:42.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:44.150 --> 00:38:44.160 align:start position:0%
you know in the in the Dark Ages when I
 
00:38:45.230 --> 00:38:45.240 align:start position:0%
was teaching
 
00:38:48.890 --> 00:38:48.900 align:start position:0%
um had uh mental illnesses that you you
 
00:38:51.410 --> 00:38:51.420 align:start position:0%
would probably uh describe them as that
 
00:38:53.750 --> 00:38:53.760 align:start position:0%
or even eating disorders that we knew
 
00:38:56.329 --> 00:38:56.339 align:start position:0%
that they they uh were working with the
 
00:38:58.569 --> 00:38:58.579 align:start position:0%
school and they missed a number of days
 
00:39:02.150 --> 00:39:02.160 align:start position:0%
and a lot of times the if the material
 
00:39:04.010 --> 00:39:04.020 align:start position:0%
couldn't be sent home and effectively
 
00:39:06.490 --> 00:39:06.500 align:start position:0%
done for teaching they actually hired a
 
00:39:10.130 --> 00:39:10.140 align:start position:0%
tutor to go to the house uh under a 504
 
00:39:12.650 --> 00:39:12.660 align:start position:0%
plan so
 
00:39:15.950 --> 00:39:15.960 align:start position:0%
further discussion representative miler
 
00:39:18.710 --> 00:39:18.720 align:start position:0%
and clearly the issue of
 
00:39:22.250 --> 00:39:22.260 align:start position:0%
student mental health is a
 
00:39:24.170 --> 00:39:24.180 align:start position:0%
been brought to our attention and it's
 
00:39:25.730 --> 00:39:25.740 align:start position:0%
been all over the news so we know that
 
00:39:27.170 --> 00:39:27.180 align:start position:0%
this is an issue
 
00:39:29.450 --> 00:39:29.460 align:start position:0%
and we've also heard
 
00:39:31.550 --> 00:39:31.560 align:start position:0%
that school districts have in fact
 
00:39:34.310 --> 00:39:34.320 align:start position:0%
policies that cover this
 
00:39:38.569 --> 00:39:38.579 align:start position:0%
and I was looking at a couple of the
 
00:39:41.569 --> 00:39:41.579 align:start position:0%
letters that we received supporting this
 
00:39:43.370 --> 00:39:43.380 align:start position:0%
particular Bill and what I'm trying to
 
00:39:46.609 --> 00:39:46.619 align:start position:0%
figure out what is the intent
 
00:39:49.069 --> 00:39:49.079 align:start position:0%
behind the bill
 
00:39:51.170 --> 00:39:51.180 align:start position:0%
I mean whenever I look at a bill like
 
00:39:53.450 --> 00:39:53.460 align:start position:0%
this I I always want to know
 
00:39:56.510 --> 00:39:56.520 align:start position:0%
why is this being proposed
 
00:39:58.849 --> 00:39:58.859 align:start position:0%
when there are it appears that there are
 
00:40:00.290 --> 00:40:00.300 align:start position:0%
already safeguards within school
 
00:40:03.349 --> 00:40:03.359 align:start position:0%
districts Etc with policies Etc
 
00:40:05.450 --> 00:40:05.460 align:start position:0%
I mean clearly we want to be able to
 
00:40:05.460 --> 00:40:06.530 align:start position:0%
I mean clearly we want to be able to
protect

00:40:06.530 --> 00:40:06.540 align:start position:0%
protect
 
00:40:10.010 --> 00:40:10.020 align:start position:0%
the mental health of students Etc but
 
00:40:11.630 --> 00:40:11.640 align:start position:0%
when I look at a bill like this with all
 
00:40:13.910 --> 00:40:13.920 align:start position:0%
the safeguards we've just heard about
 
00:40:16.250 --> 00:40:16.260 align:start position:0%
I just I'm looking at what what is the
 
00:40:18.109 --> 00:40:18.119 align:start position:0%
maybe maybe we can get an answer from
 
00:40:20.569 --> 00:40:20.579 align:start position:0%
that if you look at the prime sponsor
 
00:40:22.730 --> 00:40:22.740 align:start position:0%
and the co-sponsors of this legislation
 
00:40:24.970 --> 00:40:24.980 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsors in the room
 
00:40:28.910 --> 00:40:28.920 align:start position:0%
so represent Alexander are you are you
 
00:40:30.230 --> 00:40:30.240 align:start position:0%
willing to come forward and try to
 
00:40:32.630 --> 00:40:32.640 align:start position:0%
respond to what was your intent or
 
00:40:35.870 --> 00:40:35.880 align:start position:0%
rational behind submitting this
 
00:40:38.630 --> 00:40:38.640 align:start position:0%
thank you for being here
 
00:40:41.450 --> 00:40:41.460 align:start position:0%
thank you um House Education Mr chair
 
00:40:42.890 --> 00:40:42.900 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is representative
 
00:40:44.210 --> 00:40:44.220 align:start position:0%
Alexander I represent the town of
 
00:40:44.220 --> 00:40:45.710 align:start position:0%
Alexander I represent the town of
Goffstown

00:40:45.710 --> 00:40:45.720 align:start position:0%
Goffstown
 
00:40:48.770 --> 00:40:48.780 align:start position:0%
um so I'm the intent of this bill is to
 
00:40:50.810 --> 00:40:50.820 align:start position:0%
provide a flag and create communication
 
00:40:52.790 --> 00:40:52.800 align:start position:0%
between parents in the school district
 
00:40:55.190 --> 00:40:55.200 align:start position:0%
and the students so when we talk about
 
00:40:57.589 --> 00:40:57.599 align:start position:0%
mental health or mental illness it might
 
00:40:59.390 --> 00:40:59.400 align:start position:0%
just be one day I'm not feeling well
 
00:41:01.250 --> 00:41:01.260 align:start position:0%
like I woke up and I just was not
 
00:41:02.930 --> 00:41:02.940 align:start position:0%
feeling well and
 
00:41:05.750 --> 00:41:05.760 align:start position:0%
um it could be not anything diagnosed by
 
00:41:07.250 --> 00:41:07.260 align:start position:0%
a doctor or anything but you know a
 
00:41:08.390 --> 00:41:08.400 align:start position:0%
student that might need that a little
 
00:41:11.870 --> 00:41:11.880 align:start position:0%
extra support and if the if this is
 
00:41:13.550 --> 00:41:13.560 align:start position:0%
flagged for the school district and the
 
00:41:15.050 --> 00:41:15.060 align:start position:0%
school district knows and the parent
 
00:41:17.810 --> 00:41:17.820 align:start position:0%
calls in and says my child's taking a
 
00:41:19.609 --> 00:41:19.619 align:start position:0%
day off maybe the school district can
 
00:41:21.170 --> 00:41:21.180 align:start position:0%
keep and keep a closer eye on that child
 
00:41:22.250 --> 00:41:22.260 align:start position:0%
make sure that they're getting the
 
00:41:25.130 --> 00:41:25.140 align:start position:0%
support that they need I've heard from
 
00:41:28.130 --> 00:41:28.140 align:start position:0%
multiple parents that sometimes students
 
00:41:29.750 --> 00:41:29.760 align:start position:0%
fall through the cracks and we just want
 
00:41:31.490 --> 00:41:31.500 align:start position:0%
to make sure that we're creating a
 
00:41:33.650 --> 00:41:33.660 align:start position:0%
system where there's more communication
 
00:41:34.730 --> 00:41:34.740 align:start position:0%
between the parent and School District
 
00:41:36.109 --> 00:41:36.119 align:start position:0%
especially if their child needs extra
 
00:41:36.119 --> 00:41:37.670 align:start position:0%
especially if their child needs extra
help

00:41:37.670 --> 00:41:37.680 align:start position:0%
help
 
00:41:39.950 --> 00:41:39.960 align:start position:0%
so let me follow up and then represent
 
00:41:44.089 --> 00:41:44.099 align:start position:0%
parano the an item number four here
 
00:41:46.490 --> 00:41:46.500 align:start position:0%
uh the students shall be considered
 
00:41:48.650 --> 00:41:48.660 align:start position:0%
present by their school during the
 
00:41:51.349 --> 00:41:51.359 align:start position:0%
excused absence
 
00:41:55.730 --> 00:41:55.740 align:start position:0%
if you're declaring that that there are
 
00:41:58.609 --> 00:41:58.619 align:start position:0%
present but they may have an uh excused
 
00:42:00.470 --> 00:42:00.480 align:start position:0%
absence because it's it's a mental
 
00:42:02.530 --> 00:42:02.540 align:start position:0%
health issue
 
00:42:05.210 --> 00:42:05.220 align:start position:0%
is the school now because the present
 
00:42:08.390 --> 00:42:08.400 align:start position:0%
responsible for providing that one day
 
00:42:10.970 --> 00:42:10.980 align:start position:0%
or two day that student's out the
 
00:42:13.849 --> 00:42:13.859 align:start position:0%
activities which are the academic class
 
00:42:16.609 --> 00:42:16.619 align:start position:0%
work that's being presented is that we
 
00:42:18.890 --> 00:42:18.900 align:start position:0%
oftentimes when a kid was absent would
 
00:42:20.810 --> 00:42:20.820 align:start position:0%
the teacher would follow that up maybe
 
00:42:22.910 --> 00:42:22.920 align:start position:0%
that evening saying hey you know here's
 
00:42:24.470 --> 00:42:24.480 align:start position:0%
some things which we're doing you could
 
00:42:25.910 --> 00:42:25.920 align:start position:0%
be reading this you could be doing a
 
00:42:27.530 --> 00:42:27.540 align:start position:0%
spelling lesson if it's a grade school
 
00:42:30.589 --> 00:42:30.599 align:start position:0%
kid Etc are they required Now by saying
 
00:42:32.270 --> 00:42:32.280 align:start position:0%
you are present so we're going to hold
 
00:42:33.829 --> 00:42:33.839 align:start position:0%
you accountable for what was taught
 
00:42:36.109 --> 00:42:36.119 align:start position:0%
during that day well I I think it's
 
00:42:37.490 --> 00:42:37.500 align:start position:0%
pretty vital that the school gives the
 
00:42:39.050 --> 00:42:39.060 align:start position:0%
opportunity for the student to miss like
 
00:42:41.870 --> 00:42:41.880 align:start position:0%
make up that work but this language and
 
00:42:43.670 --> 00:42:43.680 align:start position:0%
Martha Dickey's here too and she came up
 
00:42:45.950 --> 00:42:45.960 align:start position:0%
like it was from other states that this
 
00:42:47.270 --> 00:42:47.280 align:start position:0%
language came from
 
00:42:49.730 --> 00:42:49.740 align:start position:0%
um it like various different states so
 
00:42:51.950 --> 00:42:51.960 align:start position:0%
I'm leaving honestly the language up to
 
00:42:53.210 --> 00:42:53.220 align:start position:0%
the committee I'm happy to come back
 
00:42:54.650 --> 00:42:54.660 align:start position:0%
with um
 
00:42:57.170 --> 00:42:57.180 align:start position:0%
language that addresses doctors know
 
00:42:59.690 --> 00:42:59.700 align:start position:0%
non-doctors know but I just want to make
 
00:43:02.210 --> 00:43:02.220 align:start position:0%
sure that the intent of the bill is to
 
00:43:03.650 --> 00:43:03.660 align:start position:0%
protect the student and create more
 
00:43:05.750 --> 00:43:05.760 align:start position:0%
communication on mental or behavioral
 
00:43:08.349 --> 00:43:08.359 align:start position:0%
health problems I think representative
 
00:43:10.250 --> 00:43:10.260 align:start position:0%
I'm just
 
00:43:13.250 --> 00:43:13.260 align:start position:0%
confused about that because if there's
 
00:43:15.050 --> 00:43:15.060 align:start position:0%
open communication between the parents
 
00:43:17.030 --> 00:43:17.040 align:start position:0%
and the school shouldn't the parents
 
00:43:18.770 --> 00:43:18.780 align:start position:0%
already feel comfortable contacting the
 
00:43:22.370 --> 00:43:22.380 align:start position:0%
school and say my child might have some
 
00:43:25.190 --> 00:43:25.200 align:start position:0%
mental health issues and I need some
 
00:43:26.630 --> 00:43:26.640 align:start position:0%
help dealing with that do you think you
 
00:43:26.640 --> 00:43:27.470 align:start position:0%
help dealing with that do you think you
could

00:43:27.470 --> 00:43:27.480 align:start position:0%
could
 
00:43:29.470 --> 00:43:29.480 align:start position:0%
offer some suggestions
 
00:43:33.050 --> 00:43:33.060 align:start position:0%
again as representative Miler said I'm a
 
00:43:34.970 --> 00:43:34.980 align:start position:0%
little confused as to what the actual
 
00:43:37.190 --> 00:43:37.200 align:start position:0%
intent is and why this bill is truly
 
00:43:38.690 --> 00:43:38.700 align:start position:0%
necessary because it does seem like we
 
00:43:40.670 --> 00:43:40.680 align:start position:0%
have a lot of safeguards for the
 
00:43:43.309 --> 00:43:43.319 align:start position:0%
students already in place the idea is
 
00:43:45.109 --> 00:43:45.119 align:start position:0%
thank you the question the idea is that
 
00:43:46.790 --> 00:43:46.800 align:start position:0%
the parent would call and say can you
 
00:43:48.770 --> 00:43:48.780 align:start position:0%
please keep a closer eye on my child but
 
00:43:50.870 --> 00:43:50.880 align:start position:0%
I think that by taking that mental
 
00:43:51.890 --> 00:43:51.900 align:start position:0%
health day
 
00:43:51.900 --> 00:43:53.390 align:start position:0%
health day
there

00:43:53.390 --> 00:43:53.400 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:43:55.970 --> 00:43:55.980 align:start position:0%
it's it's kind of like an unsaid thing
 
00:43:57.410 --> 00:43:57.420 align:start position:0%
that maybe they might need that extra
 
00:43:59.210 --> 00:43:59.220 align:start position:0%
support so
 
00:44:01.790 --> 00:44:01.800 align:start position:0%
um you know a student might go to their
 
00:44:03.890 --> 00:44:03.900 align:start position:0%
parent and say I'd like to take the day
 
00:44:06.050 --> 00:44:06.060 align:start position:0%
off and the parent might not ask any
 
00:44:07.670 --> 00:44:07.680 align:start position:0%
more questions and they just say I need
 
00:44:09.589 --> 00:44:09.599 align:start position:0%
to take a mental health day
 
00:44:09.599 --> 00:44:10.430 align:start position:0%
to take a mental health day
um

00:44:10.430 --> 00:44:10.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:11.809 --> 00:44:11.819 align:start position:0%
and then it's just something for the
 
00:44:14.150 --> 00:44:14.160 align:start position:0%
school to follow up with later at some
 
00:44:14.160 --> 00:44:15.589 align:start position:0%
school to follow up with later at some
point

00:44:15.589 --> 00:44:15.599 align:start position:0%
point
 
00:44:17.690 --> 00:44:17.700 align:start position:0%
I don't I think
 
00:44:19.790 --> 00:44:19.800 align:start position:0%
I don't want I know the committee's job
 
00:44:21.890 --> 00:44:21.900 align:start position:0%
is to overthink but I don't want the
 
00:44:24.050 --> 00:44:24.060 align:start position:0%
committee to overthink so
 
00:44:24.060 --> 00:44:24.890 align:start position:0%
committee to overthink so
um

00:44:24.890 --> 00:44:24.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:28.910 --> 00:44:28.920 align:start position:0%
I don't the language itself in here does
 
00:44:31.250 --> 00:44:31.260 align:start position:0%
not bother me how it's changed I just
 
00:44:33.170 --> 00:44:33.180 align:start position:0%
like at least some the state being like
 
00:44:35.150 --> 00:44:35.160 align:start position:0%
we're going to allow mental health to
 
00:44:36.650 --> 00:44:36.660 align:start position:0%
give support to those students allow for
 
00:44:38.089 --> 00:44:38.099 align:start position:0%
more communication with Administration
 
00:44:40.069 --> 00:44:40.079 align:start position:0%
and teachers and guidance counselors to
 
00:44:41.270 --> 00:44:41.280 align:start position:0%
make sure that we're protecting all of
 
00:44:41.280 --> 00:44:42.530 align:start position:0%
make sure that we're protecting all of
them

00:44:42.530 --> 00:44:42.540 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:44:46.190 --> 00:44:46.200 align:start position:0%
represent Cornell I I guess if we're
 
00:44:47.569 --> 00:44:47.579 align:start position:0%
going to put something like that in I
 
00:44:48.950 --> 00:44:48.960 align:start position:0%
would almost like to put part of the
 
00:44:50.630 --> 00:44:50.640 align:start position:0%
burden on the parent to say the parent
 
00:44:53.270 --> 00:44:53.280 align:start position:0%
will contact the school guidance
 
00:44:55.430 --> 00:44:55.440 align:start position:0%
counselor or the principal rather than
 
00:44:57.130 --> 00:44:57.140 align:start position:0%
when they call in it's the secretary
 
00:44:59.809 --> 00:44:59.819 align:start position:0%
who's not only giving everybody admit
 
00:45:02.210 --> 00:45:02.220 align:start position:0%
slips but answering the phone and that
 
00:45:04.370 --> 00:45:04.380 align:start position:0%
that will get lost you know quite
 
00:45:06.230 --> 00:45:06.240 align:start position:0%
honestly if there's one secretary doing
 
00:45:08.270 --> 00:45:08.280 align:start position:0%
all of that and then to expect the
 
00:45:10.970 --> 00:45:10.980 align:start position:0%
secretary to pass along the word to a a
 
00:45:12.710 --> 00:45:12.720 align:start position:0%
guidance counselor in a school say of
 
00:45:14.870 --> 00:45:14.880 align:start position:0%
Central High School with 2000 students
 
00:45:16.670 --> 00:45:16.680 align:start position:0%
to pass it along to the guidance
 
00:45:18.710 --> 00:45:18.720 align:start position:0%
counselor oh so-and-so's mother called
 
00:45:20.510 --> 00:45:20.520 align:start position:0%
him in today and said that they were
 
00:45:22.910 --> 00:45:22.920 align:start position:0%
having a rough day that's leaving a lot
 
00:45:25.910 --> 00:45:25.920 align:start position:0%
to chance I think you know so almost to
 
00:45:29.089 --> 00:45:29.099 align:start position:0%
say you know if it's some if it's a
 
00:45:31.190 --> 00:45:31.200 align:start position:0%
personal thing like that get in touch
 
00:45:33.410 --> 00:45:33.420 align:start position:0%
with someone in the school who can
 
00:45:36.829 --> 00:45:36.839 align:start position:0%
respond better but also I want to bring
 
00:45:39.109 --> 00:45:39.119 align:start position:0%
up Manchester for an excusing the
 
00:45:40.609 --> 00:45:40.619 align:start position:0%
principal or his designee shall
 
00:45:42.530 --> 00:45:42.540 align:start position:0%
determine if the absence is excuse for
 
00:45:44.270 --> 00:45:44.280 align:start position:0%
good cause for any other reason not
 
00:45:45.650 --> 00:45:45.660 align:start position:0%
listed above
 
00:45:48.410 --> 00:45:48.420 align:start position:0%
which means in that case the parent may
 
00:45:50.270 --> 00:45:50.280 align:start position:0%
already have been in contact with
 
00:45:53.150 --> 00:45:53.160 align:start position:0%
somebody and they know what's going on I
 
00:45:54.530 --> 00:45:54.540 align:start position:0%
just I just don't want it left to change
 
00:45:56.809 --> 00:45:56.819 align:start position:0%
if if that's going to be the issue you
 
00:45:59.270 --> 00:45:59.280 align:start position:0%
know let's not leave it to chance of
 
00:46:01.190 --> 00:46:01.200 align:start position:0%
whoever's answering the phone or if
 
00:46:02.930 --> 00:46:02.940 align:start position:0%
there's an answering machine in some
 
00:46:05.990 --> 00:46:06.000 align:start position:0%
schools for for calling out
 
00:46:08.870 --> 00:46:08.880 align:start position:0%
represent cascadden uh just to add if
 
00:46:10.730 --> 00:46:10.740 align:start position:0%
you're from Goffstown Goffstown High
 
00:46:13.609 --> 00:46:13.619 align:start position:0%
School is a PBIS school I don't know if
 
00:46:15.010 --> 00:46:15.020 align:start position:0%
you're familiar with that it's positive
 
00:46:17.270 --> 00:46:17.280 align:start position:0%
supports and behavioral interventions
 
00:46:19.550 --> 00:46:19.560 align:start position:0%
and it functions on a three-tier
 
00:46:23.329 --> 00:46:23.339 align:start position:0%
framework process so that kids who need
 
00:46:25.250 --> 00:46:25.260 align:start position:0%
support whether it's mental health or
 
00:46:26.750 --> 00:46:26.760 align:start position:0%
Behavioral Health
 
00:46:29.750 --> 00:46:29.760 align:start position:0%
it would be part of that structure
 
00:46:32.089 --> 00:46:32.099 align:start position:0%
but now that's not saying they're going
 
00:46:34.609 --> 00:46:34.619 align:start position:0%
to know every single student but it is
 
00:46:37.670 --> 00:46:37.680 align:start position:0%
designed so that there's a coach that
 
00:46:41.210 --> 00:46:41.220 align:start position:0%
does get to know every single student so
 
00:46:42.829 --> 00:46:42.839 align:start position:0%
they do have that model I don't know how
 
00:46:45.710 --> 00:46:45.720 align:start position:0%
well it's working but um part of the
 
00:46:48.829 --> 00:46:48.839 align:start position:0%
intent of that whole school structure is
 
00:46:51.290 --> 00:46:51.300 align:start position:0%
to help and support those kids
 
00:46:53.329 --> 00:46:53.339 align:start position:0%
represent Tanner
 
00:46:55.849 --> 00:46:55.859 align:start position:0%
thank you and and kind of in terms of
 
00:46:58.010 --> 00:46:58.020 align:start position:0%
overthinking something are you needing
 
00:47:00.410 --> 00:47:00.420 align:start position:0%
to talk to oh the represent any further
 
00:47:03.370 --> 00:47:03.380 align:start position:0%
um now we can have them sit down oh okay
 
00:47:05.569 --> 00:47:05.579 align:start position:0%
is there something for him not not
 
00:47:07.730 --> 00:47:07.740 align:start position:0%
necessarily thank you are there any
 
00:47:10.309 --> 00:47:10.319 align:start position:0%
other other questions directly for this
 
00:47:12.770 --> 00:47:12.780 align:start position:0%
man right here not seeing thank you very
 
00:47:15.290 --> 00:47:15.300 align:start position:0%
much thank you representative Alexander
 
00:47:17.690 --> 00:47:17.700 align:start position:0%
okay go ahead no so
 
00:47:21.170 --> 00:47:21.180 align:start position:0%
um this particular bill was set in 189
 
00:47:24.589 --> 00:47:24.599 align:start position:0%
colon 34 which my book
 
00:47:27.050 --> 00:47:27.060 align:start position:0%
um I noticed uh kind of open to that
 
00:47:30.650 --> 00:47:30.660 align:start position:0%
that that it has a section in it a
 
00:47:32.569 --> 00:47:32.579 align:start position:0%
definition of excused absence and a
 
00:47:34.790 --> 00:47:34.800 align:start position:0%
process for considering exceptions to
 
00:47:37.910 --> 00:47:37.920 align:start position:0%
absences not otherwise excuse is one of
 
00:47:37.920 --> 00:47:38.990 align:start position:0%
absences not otherwise excuse is one of
the

00:47:38.990 --> 00:47:39.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:47:41.450 --> 00:47:41.460 align:start position:0%
um parts for the school board policies
 
00:47:43.670 --> 00:47:43.680 align:start position:0%
and the second part of it is a process
 
00:47:45.710 --> 00:47:45.720 align:start position:0%
for intervention designed to address
 
00:47:48.410 --> 00:47:48.420 align:start position:0%
individual cases of truancy as quickly
 
00:47:51.890 --> 00:47:51.900 align:start position:0%
as possible and I think
 
00:47:54.589 --> 00:47:54.599 align:start position:0%
we're getting into the to the details
 
00:47:56.630 --> 00:47:56.640 align:start position:0%
that maybe belong at the local District
 
00:47:59.870 --> 00:47:59.880 align:start position:0%
level and certainly from the different
 
00:48:01.370 --> 00:48:01.380 align:start position:0%
schools that we've looked up already
 
00:48:04.250 --> 00:48:04.260 align:start position:0%
they are following this policy
 
00:48:04.260 --> 00:48:05.050 align:start position:0%
they are following this policy
um

00:48:05.050 --> 00:48:05.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:48:08.270 --> 00:48:08.280 align:start position:0%
to have definitions of excuse policies
 
00:48:10.670 --> 00:48:10.680 align:start position:0%
to have a process of intervention as
 
00:48:13.670 --> 00:48:13.680 align:start position:0%
prescribed in the statutes and I don't
 
00:48:15.890 --> 00:48:15.900 align:start position:0%
think we need to go into
 
00:48:18.950 --> 00:48:18.960 align:start position:0%
the detail that's that's in this
 
00:48:18.960 --> 00:48:20.630 align:start position:0%
the detail that's that's in this
particular

00:48:20.630 --> 00:48:20.640 align:start position:0%
particular
 
00:48:23.270 --> 00:48:23.280 align:start position:0%
um bill I mean I think it's it's
 
00:48:24.829 --> 00:48:24.839 align:start position:0%
something in New Hampshire we already
 
00:48:26.270 --> 00:48:26.280 align:start position:0%
have in statute
 
00:48:28.190 --> 00:48:28.200 align:start position:0%
and follow-up to that representative
 
00:48:30.470 --> 00:48:30.480 align:start position:0%
Tanner I know that many of the schools
 
00:48:33.290 --> 00:48:33.300 align:start position:0%
uh if you don't call in you get a call
 
00:48:34.430 --> 00:48:34.440 align:start position:0%
from them
 
00:48:37.250 --> 00:48:37.260 align:start position:0%
and I've gotten that many a time in fact
 
00:48:39.230 --> 00:48:39.240 align:start position:0%
I could have taken a mental health day
 
00:48:42.770 --> 00:48:42.780 align:start position:0%
today the Carolina Panthers got beat and
 
00:48:42.780 --> 00:48:43.609 align:start position:0%
today the Carolina Panthers got beat and
and

00:48:43.609 --> 00:48:43.619 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:48:45.170 --> 00:48:45.180 align:start position:0%
um I was watching that game I was a
 
00:48:47.210 --> 00:48:47.220 align:start position:0%
little bit disgusted because I was
 
00:48:49.069 --> 00:48:49.079 align:start position:0%
hoping that their quarterback would do
 
00:48:51.530 --> 00:48:51.540 align:start position:0%
something so is that a good is that a
 
00:48:56.349 --> 00:48:56.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:58.450 --> 00:48:58.460 align:start position:0%
you don't want to respond to that
 
00:49:01.130 --> 00:49:01.140 align:start position:0%
represent cordiello
 
00:49:03.530 --> 00:49:03.540 align:start position:0%
yeah I just have a comment uh
 
00:49:05.270 --> 00:49:05.280 align:start position:0%
representative Alexander had mentioned
 
00:49:08.210 --> 00:49:08.220 align:start position:0%
this I think a flag the word flag
 
00:49:10.190 --> 00:49:10.200 align:start position:0%
sending out the flag
 
00:49:10.200 --> 00:49:11.690 align:start position:0%
sending out the flag
and

00:49:11.690 --> 00:49:11.700 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:49:13.970 --> 00:49:13.980 align:start position:0%
as we all know mental illness does have
 
00:49:16.970 --> 00:49:16.980 align:start position:0%
a stigma and there I'm concerned that
 
00:49:19.490 --> 00:49:19.500 align:start position:0%
there will be parents who do not want
 
00:49:22.609 --> 00:49:22.619 align:start position:0%
this flag sent up and so the children in
 
00:49:25.010 --> 00:49:25.020 align:start position:0%
most need might be those parents in
 
00:49:26.329 --> 00:49:26.339 align:start position:0%
denial who don't want to have this be
 
00:49:29.030 --> 00:49:29.040 align:start position:0%
open to or for any reason maybe they
 
00:49:30.410 --> 00:49:30.420 align:start position:0%
just want to maintain their privacy but
 
00:49:32.569 --> 00:49:32.579 align:start position:0%
that they don't want that flag sent up
 
00:49:35.630 --> 00:49:35.640 align:start position:0%
and that a lot of children uh who are
 
00:49:38.150 --> 00:49:38.160 align:start position:0%
most need of help will will not benefit
 
00:49:40.130 --> 00:49:40.140 align:start position:0%
I'm just having a really hard time
 
00:49:42.710 --> 00:49:42.720 align:start position:0%
seeing why we need this so I just wanted
 
00:49:44.210 --> 00:49:44.220 align:start position:0%
to put my
 
00:49:45.950 --> 00:49:45.960 align:start position:0%
opinion in there
 
00:49:47.930 --> 00:49:47.940 align:start position:0%
further discussion from the committee
 
00:49:47.940 --> 00:49:48.770 align:start position:0%
further discussion from the committee
here

00:49:48.770 --> 00:49:48.780 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:49:48.780 --> 00:49:50.390 align:start position:0%
here
now

00:49:50.390 --> 00:49:50.400 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:49:53.150 --> 00:49:53.160 align:start position:0%
okay I don't see any more hands up on
 
00:49:57.349 --> 00:49:57.359 align:start position:0%
this is there a need for us to one eat
 
00:49:59.809 --> 00:49:59.819 align:start position:0%
to have the legislation as it is is
 
00:50:03.010 --> 00:50:03.020 align:start position:0%
there a need to modify it maybe
 
00:50:05.450 --> 00:50:05.460 align:start position:0%
then we get into some of the policy
 
00:50:07.010 --> 00:50:07.020 align:start position:0%
decision making of the local school
 
00:50:10.430 --> 00:50:10.440 align:start position:0%
district like we should be a due to a
 
00:50:12.950 --> 00:50:12.960 align:start position:0%
diagnosed mental health behavior health
 
00:50:16.190 --> 00:50:16.200 align:start position:0%
or or that that's that's in the
 
00:50:17.750 --> 00:50:17.760 align:start position:0%
diagnosis something you want after the
 
00:50:21.230 --> 00:50:21.240 align:start position:0%
five-day period you the first you don't
 
00:50:23.030 --> 00:50:23.040 align:start position:0%
you wouldn't have that
 
00:50:25.190 --> 00:50:25.200 align:start position:0%
um it's just like a medical sort a sore
 
00:50:27.710 --> 00:50:27.720 align:start position:0%
throat or the flu
 
00:50:31.370 --> 00:50:31.380 align:start position:0%
um you're out and that's excused so uh I
 
00:50:34.130 --> 00:50:34.140 align:start position:0%
guess I'm asking is there a need for
 
00:50:34.140 --> 00:50:35.329 align:start position:0%
guess I'm asking is there a need for
um

00:50:35.329 --> 00:50:35.339 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:37.730 --> 00:50:37.740 align:start position:0%
defining anything in here more so or
 
00:50:40.550 --> 00:50:40.560 align:start position:0%
clearing up any language or or is there
 
00:50:42.290 --> 00:50:42.300 align:start position:0%
even a need for the bill
 
00:50:44.030 --> 00:50:44.040 align:start position:0%
so representative cascad and then
 
00:50:45.589 --> 00:50:45.599 align:start position:0%
representative dry
 
00:50:48.470 --> 00:50:48.480 align:start position:0%
are we able to itl this bill yeah oh
 
00:50:51.290 --> 00:50:51.300 align:start position:0%
yeah well yes you we would recommend it
 
00:50:53.690 --> 00:50:53.700 align:start position:0%
on that could go to the floor
 
00:50:56.270 --> 00:50:56.280 align:start position:0%
okay but we will be doing that all that
 
00:51:01.010 --> 00:51:01.020 align:start position:0%
on in November right yeah yeah
 
00:51:02.750 --> 00:51:02.760 align:start position:0%
represent dry
 
00:51:06.349 --> 00:51:06.359 align:start position:0%
thank you I I'm thinking that 2A that's
 
00:51:08.510 --> 00:51:08.520 align:start position:0%
in here right now with a definition of
 
00:51:11.030 --> 00:51:11.040 align:start position:0%
excuse absence and a process for
 
00:51:13.130 --> 00:51:13.140 align:start position:0%
considering exceptions and it's not even
 
00:51:15.230 --> 00:51:15.240 align:start position:0%
limited to that I mean that's a very
 
00:51:19.130 --> 00:51:19.140 align:start position:0%
broad statement to to a 2 and 2A I think
 
00:51:20.569 --> 00:51:20.579 align:start position:0%
it covers everything that we were
 
00:51:21.650 --> 00:51:21.660 align:start position:0%
talking about and I agree with
 
00:51:23.450 --> 00:51:23.460 align:start position:0%
representative Tanner that this is
 
00:51:26.750 --> 00:51:26.760 align:start position:0%
probably best left at the policy level
 
00:51:29.270 --> 00:51:29.280 align:start position:0%
any further discussion because if you if
 
00:51:31.490 --> 00:51:31.500 align:start position:0%
we're saying that as as a majority of
 
00:51:33.829 --> 00:51:33.839 align:start position:0%
people this is left better for
 
00:51:36.770 --> 00:51:36.780 align:start position:0%
for you know leaving it the way it is in
 
00:51:36.780 --> 00:51:37.549 align:start position:0%
for you know leaving it the way it is in
law

00:51:37.549 --> 00:51:37.559 align:start position:0%
law
 
00:51:39.890 --> 00:51:39.900 align:start position:0%
uh we don't have to have any more you
 
00:51:42.170 --> 00:51:42.180 align:start position:0%
know committee the whole on this bill we
 
00:51:43.849 --> 00:51:43.859 align:start position:0%
would basically understand where we're
 
00:51:45.470 --> 00:51:45.480 align:start position:0%
going with
 
00:51:45.480 --> 00:51:46.670 align:start position:0%
going with
um

00:51:46.670 --> 00:51:46.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:51:48.589 --> 00:51:48.599 align:start position:0%
at in November
 
00:51:51.710 --> 00:51:51.720 align:start position:0%
if not we continue to list it
 
00:51:54.589 --> 00:51:54.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:58.609 --> 00:51:58.619 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:00.049 --> 00:52:00.059 align:start position:0%
so I think I have a different point of
 
00:52:02.270 --> 00:52:02.280 align:start position:0%
view on this bill than much of what has
 
00:52:05.150 --> 00:52:05.160 align:start position:0%
been expressed and I'm not entirely sure
 
00:52:09.049 --> 00:52:09.059 align:start position:0%
how to effectively articulate it
 
00:52:09.059 --> 00:52:10.250 align:start position:0%
how to effectively articulate it
um

00:52:10.250 --> 00:52:10.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:14.510 --> 00:52:14.520 align:start position:0%
I particularly think number one lines
 
00:52:17.690 --> 00:52:17.700 align:start position:0%
four through six in the draft language
 
00:52:20.870 --> 00:52:20.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:24.230 --> 00:52:24.240 align:start position:0%
it's just not clear to me given what has
 
00:52:26.990 --> 00:52:27.000 align:start position:0%
been acknowledged about stigma around
 
00:52:28.670 --> 00:52:28.680 align:start position:0%
mental health and behavioral health
 
00:52:28.680 --> 00:52:30.230 align:start position:0%
mental health and behavioral health
issues

00:52:30.230 --> 00:52:30.240 align:start position:0%
issues
 
00:52:33.890 --> 00:52:33.900 align:start position:0%
and I think our broad acceptance that
 
00:52:36.230 --> 00:52:36.240 align:start position:0%
students today have a high incidence of
 
00:52:39.829 --> 00:52:39.839 align:start position:0%
those some of those conditions
 
00:52:43.370 --> 00:52:43.380 align:start position:0%
it's not clear to me that our students
 
00:52:45.829 --> 00:52:45.839 align:start position:0%
and families always know
 
00:52:48.530 --> 00:52:48.540 align:start position:0%
that it is an acceptable thing to stay
 
00:52:52.730 --> 00:52:52.740 align:start position:0%
home for these reasons and
 
00:52:56.210 --> 00:52:56.220 align:start position:0%
repair yourself basically I was looking
 
00:52:58.970 --> 00:52:58.980 align:start position:0%
at the testimony that new Futures
 
00:53:01.309 --> 00:53:01.319 align:start position:0%
submitted when we originally heard this
 
00:53:01.319 --> 00:53:02.690 align:start position:0%
submitted when we originally heard this
bill

00:53:02.690 --> 00:53:02.700 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:53:05.150 --> 00:53:05.160 align:start position:0%
and if I could there's in their last
 
00:53:08.150 --> 00:53:08.160 align:start position:0%
paragraph supporting it
 
00:53:10.490 --> 00:53:10.500 align:start position:0%
um it reads as follows
 
00:53:12.470 --> 00:53:12.480 align:start position:0%
allowing for mental health absences
 
00:53:14.270 --> 00:53:14.280 align:start position:0%
removes some of the stigma associated
 
00:53:15.829 --> 00:53:15.839 align:start position:0%
with having a mental health Challenge
 
00:53:17.930 --> 00:53:17.940 align:start position:0%
and I think that is part of the intent
 
00:53:19.250 --> 00:53:19.260 align:start position:0%
of this bill
 
00:53:21.109 --> 00:53:21.119 align:start position:0%
additionally it ensures that students
 
00:53:22.790 --> 00:53:22.800 align:start position:0%
are not penalized for having a mental
 
00:53:24.170 --> 00:53:24.180 align:start position:0%
health challenge just as they wouldn't
 
00:53:26.750 --> 00:53:26.760 align:start position:0%
be penalized for being physically ill
 
00:53:28.430 --> 00:53:28.440 align:start position:0%
excusing absences for mental health
 
00:53:30.109 --> 00:53:30.119 align:start position:0%
ensures that young people can take the
 
00:53:31.790 --> 00:53:31.800 align:start position:0%
time needed to tend to their well-being
 
00:53:33.770 --> 00:53:33.780 align:start position:0%
which can help minimize additional
 
00:53:35.870 --> 00:53:35.880 align:start position:0%
symptoms and give students time to seek
 
00:53:37.370 --> 00:53:37.380 align:start position:0%
the help they need
 
00:53:39.710 --> 00:53:39.720 align:start position:0%
so I just kind of wanted to make that
 
00:53:41.450 --> 00:53:41.460 align:start position:0%
statement that I think there's some
 
00:53:44.089 --> 00:53:44.099 align:start position:0%
Merit to at least part of this bill
 
00:53:47.390 --> 00:53:47.400 align:start position:0%
um thank you when the student returns to
 
00:53:48.890 --> 00:53:48.900 align:start position:0%
school they're going to have to have
 
00:53:51.770 --> 00:53:51.780 align:start position:0%
some kind of a note or from the parent
 
00:53:53.809 --> 00:53:53.819 align:start position:0%
or else it's going to go down as an
 
00:53:55.970 --> 00:53:55.980 align:start position:0%
unexcused absence
 
00:53:58.069 --> 00:53:58.079 align:start position:0%
the only way you're going to have it is
 
00:54:00.650 --> 00:54:00.660 align:start position:0%
an excused absence is if there's a note
 
00:54:03.470 --> 00:54:03.480 align:start position:0%
from the parent or Guardian is that
 
00:54:03.480 --> 00:54:05.950 align:start position:0%
from the parent or Guardian is that
correct

00:54:05.950 --> 00:54:05.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:08.390 --> 00:54:08.400 align:start position:0%
if I'm asking anybody on the committee
 
00:54:11.030 --> 00:54:11.040 align:start position:0%
here three days you have to have a note
 
00:54:12.950 --> 00:54:12.960 align:start position:0%
if you're if you're out for more than
 
00:54:15.049 --> 00:54:15.059 align:start position:0%
three days according to the policy here
 
00:54:17.510 --> 00:54:17.520 align:start position:0%
there has to be a written note submitted
 
00:54:19.490 --> 00:54:19.500 align:start position:0%
by the parent
 
00:54:22.849 --> 00:54:22.859 align:start position:0%
um so what happens in those schools
 
00:54:22.859 --> 00:54:23.809 align:start position:0%
um so what happens in those schools
which

00:54:23.809 --> 00:54:23.819 align:start position:0%
which
 
00:54:27.530 --> 00:54:27.540 align:start position:0%
say if you have so many unexcused days
 
00:54:29.990 --> 00:54:30.000 align:start position:0%
you can either drop to grade level or or
 
00:54:32.089 --> 00:54:32.099 align:start position:0%
something occurs I know that for a fact
 
00:54:34.970 --> 00:54:34.980 align:start position:0%
in a school where my your grandkids are
 
00:54:36.530 --> 00:54:36.540 align:start position:0%
going around silver a thousand kids in
 
00:54:38.210 --> 00:54:38.220 align:start position:0%
the school
 
00:54:40.849 --> 00:54:40.859 align:start position:0%
um according to this after five days of
 
00:54:43.010 --> 00:54:43.020 align:start position:0%
unexcused absences the principal will
 
00:54:45.230 --> 00:54:45.240 align:start position:0%
begin an intervention with the student
 
00:54:47.809 --> 00:54:47.819 align:start position:0%
the students parents Guardians and other
 
00:54:49.970 --> 00:54:49.980 align:start position:0%
staff members as may be deemed necessary
 
00:54:52.430 --> 00:54:52.440 align:start position:0%
and then it goes through a list of what
 
00:54:54.829 --> 00:54:54.839 align:start position:0%
the intervention should involve so if
 
00:54:56.210 --> 00:54:56.220 align:start position:0%
it's less than five how do we know the
 
00:55:04.910 --> 00:55:04.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:06.829 --> 00:55:06.839 align:start position:0%
is there no note that comes in for that
 
00:55:08.450 --> 00:55:08.460 align:start position:0%
day of absence how does the parent know
 
00:55:11.329 --> 00:55:11.339 align:start position:0%
the kid did not go to school that
 
00:55:14.450 --> 00:55:14.460 align:start position:0%
happened with number one right here
 
00:55:17.450 --> 00:55:17.460 align:start position:0%
where I didn't go to school and I showed
 
00:55:20.210 --> 00:55:20.220 align:start position:0%
up with the RCMP bringing me to school
 
00:55:22.910 --> 00:55:22.920 align:start position:0%
and and so that didn't go over well with
 
00:55:27.290 --> 00:55:27.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:28.970 --> 00:55:28.980 align:start position:0%
that's why most schools did call back
 
00:55:31.370 --> 00:55:31.380 align:start position:0%
yeah that's why there has to be some
 
00:55:33.230 --> 00:55:33.240 align:start position:0%
kind of communication even on one day
 
00:55:35.930 --> 00:55:35.940 align:start position:0%
the absence right
 
00:55:38.870 --> 00:55:38.880 align:start position:0%
it's also a safety issue
 
00:55:40.309 --> 00:55:40.319 align:start position:0%
where's the kid
 
00:55:42.710 --> 00:55:42.720 align:start position:0%
right I mean maybe something happened if
 
00:55:44.450 --> 00:55:44.460 align:start position:0%
he was a walker I mean you got to get
 
00:55:47.750 --> 00:55:47.760 align:start position:0%
your car and go look yeah right
 
00:55:47.760 --> 00:55:49.069 align:start position:0%
your car and go look yeah right
um

00:55:49.069 --> 00:55:49.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:55:51.770 --> 00:55:51.780 align:start position:0%
I think we don't give schools enough
 
00:55:51.780 --> 00:55:53.329 align:start position:0%
I think we don't give schools enough
credit

00:55:53.329 --> 00:55:53.339 align:start position:0%
credit
 
00:55:56.809 --> 00:55:56.819 align:start position:0%
we're dealing with this I mean this is
 
00:55:58.849 --> 00:55:58.859 align:start position:0%
mental health is not new schools have
 
00:56:01.309 --> 00:56:01.319 align:start position:0%
had to deal with it as far back as 10
 
00:56:03.770 --> 00:56:03.780 align:start position:0%
years 15 years where they had to start
 
00:56:05.750 --> 00:56:05.760 align:start position:0%
putting in structures within the system
 
00:56:09.230 --> 00:56:09.240 align:start position:0%
to be able to open
 
00:56:11.890 --> 00:56:11.900 align:start position:0%
to not shunning kids who are having
 
00:56:13.910 --> 00:56:13.920 align:start position:0%
mental health or behavioral health
 
00:56:13.920 --> 00:56:16.370 align:start position:0%
mental health or behavioral health
issues

00:56:16.370 --> 00:56:16.380 align:start position:0%
issues
 
00:56:16.380 --> 00:56:18.770 align:start position:0%
issues
um

00:56:18.770 --> 00:56:18.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:21.470 --> 00:56:21.480 align:start position:0%
okay so I think what we'll do because we
 
00:56:22.970 --> 00:56:22.980 align:start position:0%
have two other bills and I want to get
 
00:56:24.770 --> 00:56:24.780 align:start position:0%
them this morning as well
 
00:56:24.780 --> 00:56:25.849 align:start position:0%
them this morning as well
um

00:56:25.849 --> 00:56:25.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:56:28.190 --> 00:56:28.200 align:start position:0%
there there has been some difference in
 
00:56:30.829 --> 00:56:30.839 align:start position:0%
opinion here on this uh I want everybody
 
00:56:32.569 --> 00:56:32.579 align:start position:0%
just to think about this as we're going
 
00:56:34.609 --> 00:56:34.619 align:start position:0%
through the other two bills and reflect
 
00:56:36.349 --> 00:56:36.359 align:start position:0%
back is this something we need or we
 
00:56:38.690 --> 00:56:38.700 align:start position:0%
don't need or we need with some a
 
00:56:41.510 --> 00:56:41.520 align:start position:0%
changing language in it and we can put
 
00:56:43.069 --> 00:56:43.079 align:start position:0%
it on the docket for the next time we
 
00:56:46.250 --> 00:56:46.260 align:start position:0%
meet and try to you know put it to bed
 
00:56:47.510 --> 00:56:47.520 align:start position:0%
at that time
 
00:56:49.609 --> 00:56:49.619 align:start position:0%
is that okay with everybody
 
00:56:51.650 --> 00:56:51.660 align:start position:0%
it's a Rick can I add something yeah
 
00:56:54.349 --> 00:56:54.359 align:start position:0%
thanks thank you very much Mr chair
 
00:56:56.329 --> 00:56:56.339 align:start position:0%
um I I know I was I was out for a few
 
00:56:58.790 --> 00:56:58.800 align:start position:0%
minutes but um uh but I believe
 
00:57:00.470 --> 00:57:00.480 align:start position:0%
representative Tanner talked about a
 
00:57:01.970 --> 00:57:01.980 align:start position:0%
little bit about the section that this
 
00:57:05.870 --> 00:57:05.880 align:start position:0%
is in 189.34 which is truant officers
 
00:57:08.990 --> 00:57:09.000 align:start position:0%
and um and
 
00:57:11.270 --> 00:57:11.280 align:start position:0%
you know I think maybe a lot of people
 
00:57:14.329 --> 00:57:14.339 align:start position:0%
think that maybe you know truancy or
 
00:57:16.490 --> 00:57:16.500 align:start position:0%
true in officers is something from a
 
00:57:18.410 --> 00:57:18.420 align:start position:0%
bygone day
 
00:57:21.170 --> 00:57:21.180 align:start position:0%
um I don't recall during my 12 years on
 
00:57:23.390 --> 00:57:23.400 align:start position:0%
a school board that we ever approved or
 
00:57:26.990 --> 00:57:27.000 align:start position:0%
appointed truant officers in the uh in
 
00:57:29.450 --> 00:57:29.460 align:start position:0%
the Hopkins school districts but I think
 
00:57:32.030 --> 00:57:32.040 align:start position:0%
something that that has been discussed
 
00:57:35.630 --> 00:57:35.640 align:start position:0%
as a concern of this committee and um
 
00:57:37.430 --> 00:57:37.440 align:start position:0%
and I don't think we've done much on
 
00:57:41.109 --> 00:57:41.119 align:start position:0%
this is the um is the the
 
00:57:44.569 --> 00:57:44.579 align:start position:0%
precipitous drop in
 
00:57:47.690 --> 00:57:47.700 align:start position:0%
um admr adma whichever one you want to
 
00:57:51.109 --> 00:57:51.119 align:start position:0%
you want to call it Statewide from about
 
00:57:55.849 --> 00:57:55.859 align:start position:0%
165 000 K-12 students to now about 159
 
00:58:01.430 --> 00:58:01.440 align:start position:0%
158 000 and and it didn't happen as a
 
00:58:03.049 --> 00:58:03.059 align:start position:0%
result of the
 
00:58:06.230 --> 00:58:06.240 align:start position:0%
one-ish percent uh decline that we've
 
00:58:08.390 --> 00:58:08.400 align:start position:0%
seen over over the last couple decades
 
00:58:11.809 --> 00:58:11.819 align:start position:0%
it it came very abruptly uh during and
 
00:58:14.510 --> 00:58:14.520 align:start position:0%
following covid and and it hasn't really
 
00:58:17.690 --> 00:58:17.700 align:start position:0%
rebounded and so so
 
00:58:20.329 --> 00:58:20.339 align:start position:0%
um there seems to be somewhere around
 
00:58:23.150 --> 00:58:23.160 align:start position:0%
four or five thousand students that that
 
00:58:24.490 --> 00:58:24.500 align:start position:0%
may be
 
00:58:27.349 --> 00:58:27.359 align:start position:0%
impacted on this that our school
 
00:58:27.359 --> 00:58:28.970 align:start position:0%
impacted on this that our school
districts

00:58:28.970 --> 00:58:28.980 align:start position:0%
districts
 
00:58:32.270 --> 00:58:32.280 align:start position:0%
um probably would have had enrolled but
 
00:58:33.950 --> 00:58:33.960 align:start position:0%
we haven't seen
 
00:58:36.109 --> 00:58:36.119 align:start position:0%
we don't know where these kids are
 
00:58:37.789 --> 00:58:37.799 align:start position:0%
they're not in Nest they're not in
 
00:58:38.990 --> 00:58:39.000 align:start position:0%
public schools they're not in private
 
00:58:40.849 --> 00:58:40.859 align:start position:0%
schools they're not in homeschool census
 
00:58:42.950 --> 00:58:42.960 align:start position:0%
they're you know they're they're they're
 
00:58:44.690 --> 00:58:44.700 align:start position:0%
they're they're not part of the EFA
 
00:58:47.450 --> 00:58:47.460 align:start position:0%
program none of the other numbers have
 
00:58:50.270 --> 00:58:50.280 align:start position:0%
have sort of gone up with
 
00:58:50.280 --> 00:58:50.870 align:start position:0%
have sort of gone up with
um

00:58:50.870 --> 00:58:50.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:54.309 --> 00:58:54.319 align:start position:0%
um to to make up for this out of trend
 
00:58:58.609 --> 00:58:58.619 align:start position:0%
uh drop in um in enrollment so I just
 
00:59:01.010 --> 00:59:01.020 align:start position:0%
sort of put it out there Mr chair that
 
00:59:03.829 --> 00:59:03.839 align:start position:0%
that this section I think
 
00:59:06.770 --> 00:59:06.780 align:start position:0%
sure she does the yeah so I'll put it
 
00:59:07.750 --> 00:59:07.760 align:start position:0%
out there
 
00:59:10.549 --> 00:59:10.559 align:start position:0%
this section could be used by this
 
00:59:14.510 --> 00:59:14.520 align:start position:0%
committee to uh to be amended and and
 
00:59:16.910 --> 00:59:16.920 align:start position:0%
maybe maybe request the Department of
 
00:59:21.109 --> 00:59:21.119 align:start position:0%
Education to uh to you know report out
 
00:59:24.349 --> 00:59:24.359 align:start position:0%
on what's happened with these um with
 
00:59:25.809 --> 00:59:25.819 align:start position:0%
these five six
 
00:59:29.510 --> 00:59:29.520 align:start position:0%
thousand students that that are no
 
00:59:33.109 --> 00:59:33.119 align:start position:0%
longer in um uh enrolled in um in our
 
00:59:35.150 --> 00:59:35.160 align:start position:0%
public schools and don't appear to be
 
00:59:37.069 --> 00:59:37.079 align:start position:0%
enrolled in any other educational
 
00:59:39.950 --> 00:59:39.960 align:start position:0%
setting including efas including
 
00:59:41.870 --> 00:59:41.880 align:start position:0%
Charters including
 
00:59:41.880 --> 00:59:43.309 align:start position:0%
Charters including
um

00:59:43.309 --> 00:59:43.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:44.930 --> 00:59:44.940 align:start position:0%
um uh home school
 
00:59:48.109 --> 00:59:48.119 align:start position:0%
settings uh and I know it's different
 
00:59:50.510 --> 00:59:50.520 align:start position:0%
than the than the than the purpose of
 
00:59:53.329 --> 00:59:53.339 align:start position:0%
the bill but uh but it might be a useful
 
00:59:53.339 --> 00:59:54.470 align:start position:0%
the bill but uh but it might be a useful
purpose

00:59:54.470 --> 00:59:54.480 align:start position:0%
purpose
 
00:59:54.480 --> 00:59:55.490 align:start position:0%
purpose
um

00:59:55.490 --> 00:59:55.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:57.829 --> 00:59:57.839 align:start position:0%
in this in this section but I just sort
 
01:00:00.049 --> 01:00:00.059 align:start position:0%
of put it out there uh because I I don't
 
01:00:01.370 --> 01:00:01.380 align:start position:0%
want to lose I don't want to I don't
 
01:00:03.349 --> 01:00:03.359 align:start position:0%
want this committee to lose the fact
 
01:00:05.690 --> 01:00:05.700 align:start position:0%
that um that that we've seen a
 
01:00:08.690 --> 01:00:08.700 align:start position:0%
precipitous covid related decline that
 
01:00:10.910 --> 01:00:10.920 align:start position:0%
has not bounced back where are these
 
01:00:12.710 --> 01:00:12.720 align:start position:0%
students because we do have a
 
01:00:14.690 --> 01:00:14.700 align:start position:0%
constitutional obligation to provide a
 
01:00:16.309 --> 01:00:16.319 align:start position:0%
adequate opportunity for an adequate
 
01:00:18.890 --> 01:00:18.900 align:start position:0%
education for them
 
01:00:21.230 --> 01:00:21.240 align:start position:0%
okay so what we will do is we'll bounce
 
01:00:22.970 --> 01:00:22.980 align:start position:0%
into the other two here but I would
 
01:00:25.130 --> 01:00:25.140 align:start position:0%
suggest that if you have
 
01:00:25.140 --> 01:00:27.349 align:start position:0%
suggest that if you have
uh

01:00:27.349 --> 01:00:27.359 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:00:31.309 --> 01:00:31.319 align:start position:0%
a desire to possibly amend this or
 
01:00:33.410 --> 01:00:33.420 align:start position:0%
delete part of this whatever you may or
 
01:00:34.970 --> 01:00:34.980 align:start position:0%
there might be some saying I don't want
 
01:00:37.490 --> 01:00:37.500 align:start position:0%
it that's fine but there if you want to
 
01:00:40.130 --> 01:00:40.140 align:start position:0%
try to put some bullets down that we can
 
01:00:42.890 --> 01:00:42.900 align:start position:0%
share when you come next time if an
 
01:00:45.230 --> 01:00:45.240 align:start position:0%
amendment has to be made we can address
 
01:00:47.930 --> 01:00:47.940 align:start position:0%
those write down the numbers here and
 
01:00:50.270 --> 01:00:50.280 align:start position:0%
and then uh come out with something
 
01:00:52.190 --> 01:00:52.200 align:start position:0%
possibly towards the latter part of the
 
01:00:54.650 --> 01:00:54.660 align:start position:0%
meeting a lot of good discussion here on
 
01:00:56.390 --> 01:00:56.400 align:start position:0%
that and it's related to the next Bills
 
01:00:58.609 --> 01:00:58.619 align:start position:0%
which are coming up here so with that
 
01:01:01.569 --> 01:01:01.579 align:start position:0%
let's get into 505
 
01:01:05.210 --> 01:01:05.220 align:start position:0%
uh relative to comprehensive mental
 
01:01:09.710 --> 01:01:09.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:12.950 --> 01:01:12.960 align:start position:0%
what I want to do for everybody here
 
01:01:15.730 --> 01:01:15.740 align:start position:0%
um I'm going to pass out to you the
 
01:01:21.230 --> 01:01:21.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:21.240 --> 01:01:23.030 align:start position:0%
 
framework

01:01:23.030 --> 01:01:23.040 align:start position:0%
framework
 
01:01:25.490 --> 01:01:25.500 align:start position:0%
it's a copy which has been approved by
 
01:01:27.530 --> 01:01:27.540 align:start position:0%
the State Board of Education I'll be
 
01:01:31.849 --> 01:01:31.859 align:start position:0%
albeit back in 2003
 
01:01:34.430 --> 01:01:34.440 align:start position:0%
but it's the most recent
 
01:01:36.710 --> 01:01:36.720 align:start position:0%
I'm also going to hand out to everybody
 
01:01:39.589 --> 01:01:39.599 align:start position:0%
a copy of the
 
01:01:39.599 --> 01:01:42.829 align:start position:0%
a copy of the
8306

01:01:42.829 --> 01:01:42.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:45.829 --> 01:01:45.839 align:start position:0%
40 rules here
 
01:01:49.430 --> 01:01:49.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:51.349 --> 01:01:51.359 align:start position:0%
handed out
 
01:01:51.359 --> 01:01:53.210 align:start position:0%
handed out
um

01:01:53.210 --> 01:01:53.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:01:53.220 --> 01:01:55.789 align:start position:0%
um
also

01:01:55.789 --> 01:01:55.799 align:start position:0%
also
 
01:01:59.690 --> 01:01:59.700 align:start position:0%
I got a report here back from
 
01:02:01.730 --> 01:02:01.740 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education on a report
 
01:02:03.049 --> 01:02:03.059 align:start position:0%
in health and physical education
 
01:02:05.270 --> 01:02:05.280 align:start position:0%
curriculum in the schools what's being
 
01:02:07.430 --> 01:02:07.440 align:start position:0%
taught or what's not being taught it's a
 
01:02:09.530 --> 01:02:09.540 align:start position:0%
survey of all the school districts in
 
01:02:22.329 --> 01:02:22.339 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:28.150 --> 01:02:28.160 align:start position:0%
I'm also passing out to you uh the
 
01:02:30.890 --> 01:02:30.900 align:start position:0%
t-e-e-t-e-a school uh Texas Education
 
01:02:34.670 --> 01:02:34.680 align:start position:0%
Agency doe Texas uh they have a mental
 
01:02:37.250 --> 01:02:37.260 align:start position:0%
health uh program as well and they
 
01:02:39.770 --> 01:02:39.780 align:start position:0%
Define what a comprehensive School
 
01:02:41.870 --> 01:02:41.880 align:start position:0%
mental health program is in this
 
01:02:46.069 --> 01:02:46.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:48.410 --> 01:02:48.420 align:start position:0%
and just hopefully I'm splitting these
 
01:02:50.089 --> 01:02:50.099 align:start position:0%
things up right so everybody can have a
 
01:02:50.099 --> 01:02:58.430 align:start position:0%
things up right so everybody can have a
copy

01:02:58.430 --> 01:02:58.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:03.230 --> 01:03:03.240 align:start position:0%
and lastly for your feedback here or
 
01:03:05.329 --> 01:03:05.339 align:start position:0%
here's uh
 
01:03:07.569 --> 01:03:07.579 align:start position:0%
I took this off the web the other night
 
01:03:11.569 --> 01:03:11.579 align:start position:0%
uh dealing with resiliency and mental
 
01:03:13.910 --> 01:03:13.920 align:start position:0%

01:03:22.069 --> 01:03:22.079 align:start position:0%
if anybody doesn't get a copy let me
 
01:03:24.410 --> 01:03:24.420 align:start position:0%
know and we'll see if we can balance it
 
01:03:24.420 --> 01:03:25.190 align:start position:0%
know and we'll see if we can balance it
out

01:03:25.190 --> 01:03:25.200 align:start position:0%
out
 
01:03:27.650 --> 01:03:27.660 align:start position:0%
should be enough
 
01:03:35.089 --> 01:03:35.099 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:38.210 --> 01:03:38.220 align:start position:0%
and lastly there's a form here which is
 
01:03:40.329 --> 01:03:40.339 align:start position:0%
put together by Jennifer four
 
01:03:42.770 --> 01:03:42.780 align:start position:0%
responding to that survey that was put
 
01:03:44.510 --> 01:03:44.520 align:start position:0%
out to schools
 
01:03:48.470 --> 01:03:48.480 align:start position:0%
and it's kind of like a synopsis of
 
01:03:56.089 --> 01:03:56.099 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:57.950 --> 01:03:57.960 align:start position:0%
are there any extras down on that one
 
01:03:59.390 --> 01:03:59.400 align:start position:0%
over there
 
01:03:59.400 --> 01:04:01.970 align:start position:0%
over there
yeah

01:04:01.970 --> 01:04:01.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:06.109 --> 01:04:06.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:06.119 --> 01:04:23.150 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:04:23.150 --> 01:04:23.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:26.210 --> 01:04:26.220 align:start position:0%

okay we have a lot of paperwork in front
 
01:04:42.890 --> 01:04:42.900 align:start position:0%

01:05:00.770 --> 01:05:00.780 align:start position:0%
within the health program that's
 
01:05:00.780 --> 01:05:05.809 align:start position:0%
within the health program that's

01:05:05.809 --> 01:05:05.819 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:08.390 --> 01:05:08.400 align:start position:0%
and then the other sheets which came out
 
01:05:11.390 --> 01:05:11.400 align:start position:0%
this one right here is the survey sheet
 
01:05:13.010 --> 01:05:13.020 align:start position:0%
which was done of all the school
 
01:05:15.650 --> 01:05:15.660 align:start position:0%
districts's annual thing which is done
 
01:05:18.650 --> 01:05:18.660 align:start position:0%
in terms of are you addressing these
 
01:05:21.289 --> 01:05:21.299 align:start position:0%
issues which we have in statute being
 
01:05:24.530 --> 01:05:24.540 align:start position:0%
physiology hygiene health education as

01:05:45.430 --> 01:05:45.440 align:start position:0%
or maybe even something else who knows
 
01:05:47.990 --> 01:05:48.000 align:start position:0%
going on across there fiscal education
 
01:05:51.049 --> 01:05:51.059 align:start position:0%

AIDS and sexually transmitted disease
 
01:06:06.109 --> 01:06:06.119 align:start position:0%
whether those things are being taught in
 
01:06:08.089 --> 01:06:08.099 align:start position:0%
schools or not it's kind of interesting
 
01:06:12.829 --> 01:06:12.839 align:start position:0%
what uh she found out there's a
 
01:06:15.950 --> 01:06:15.960 align:start position:0%
some schools are not doing that
 
01:06:18.710 --> 01:06:18.720 align:start position:0%
uh and then of course the sheets are
 
01:06:20.270 --> 01:06:20.280 align:start position:0%
from Texas and Florida I think that's
 
01:06:22.370 --> 01:06:22.380 align:start position:0%
all that I handed out to you so it's
 
01:06:25.130 --> 01:06:25.140 align:start position:0%
open to discussion right now on on this
 
01:06:27.349 --> 01:06:27.359 align:start position:0%
the on this bill 505 dealing with a
 
01:06:28.849 --> 01:06:28.859 align:start position:0%
comprehensive mental health uh
 
01:06:31.250 --> 01:06:31.260 align:start position:0%
representative Belcher
 
01:06:33.230 --> 01:06:33.240 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and I also took the
 
01:06:35.750 --> 01:06:35.760 align:start position:0%
liberty of providing some handouts that
 
01:06:37.309 --> 01:06:37.319 align:start position:0%
I'd like to go through real quick to I
 
01:06:39.770 --> 01:06:39.780 align:start position:0%
think get a better grasp of what we're
 
01:06:41.510 --> 01:06:41.520 align:start position:0%
looking at and what we may be looking at
 
01:06:43.190 --> 01:06:43.200 align:start position:0%
here don't worry we're not going to go
 
01:06:44.390 --> 01:06:44.400 align:start position:0%
through all of it you're welcome to read
 
01:06:46.549 --> 01:06:46.559 align:start position:0%
it all head to toe on your own we're
 
01:06:48.289 --> 01:06:48.299 align:start position:0%
just going to hit some highlights
 
01:06:50.510 --> 01:06:50.520 align:start position:0%
so we didn't get a lot of
 
01:06:53.089 --> 01:06:53.099 align:start position:0%
um real firm information as to the full
 
01:06:55.010 --> 01:06:55.020 align:start position:0%
scope of what constitutes comprehensive
 
01:06:56.329 --> 01:06:56.339 align:start position:0%
or even just regular mental health
 
01:06:59.270 --> 01:06:59.280 align:start position:0%
education so I figured one of the best
 
01:07:01.250 --> 01:07:01.260 align:start position:0%
places to look at where we might be
 
01:07:04.069 --> 01:07:04.079 align:start position:0%
headed would be to go to the school
 
01:07:05.750 --> 01:07:05.760 align:start position:0%
Counselors Association
 
01:07:07.549 --> 01:07:07.559 align:start position:0%

01:07:19.250 --> 01:07:19.260 align:start position:0%
first handout labeled with the one on
 
01:07:22.630 --> 01:07:22.640 align:start position:0%
top identifies one such core directive
 
01:07:25.430 --> 01:07:25.440 align:start position:0%
of their Association
 
01:07:29.150 --> 01:07:29.160 align:start position:0%
to be Embrace their role as social
 
01:07:33.470 --> 01:07:33.480 align:start position:0%
justice Advocates and change agents
 
01:07:35.930 --> 01:07:35.940 align:start position:0%
in developing this particular position
 
01:07:37.549 --> 01:07:37.559 align:start position:0%
statement they cite a number of
 
01:07:39.370 --> 01:07:39.380 align:start position:0%
resources which are on the back page
 
01:07:42.289 --> 01:07:42.299 align:start position:0%
including ibrahimax candies how to be an

01:07:47.690 --> 01:07:47.700 align:start position:0%
moving on to the second handout we have
 
01:07:49.970 --> 01:07:49.980 align:start position:0%
an article from eSchool news a popular
 
01:07:52.789 --> 01:07:52.799 align:start position:0%
online website for school
 
01:07:55.789 --> 01:07:55.799 align:start position:0%

and Health Services in schools wherein
 
01:08:06.890 --> 01:08:06.900 align:start position:0%
they specifically talk about providing
 
01:08:09.230 --> 01:08:09.240 align:start position:0%
students access to confidential Health
 
01:08:09.240 --> 01:08:10.190 align:start position:0%
students access to confidential Health
Care

01:08:10.190 --> 01:08:10.200 align:start position:0%
Care
 
01:08:13.430 --> 01:08:13.440 align:start position:0%
they cite mental health symptoms they
 
01:08:15.109 --> 01:08:15.119 align:start position:0%
particularly would like to bring in
 
01:08:17.930 --> 01:08:17.940 align:start position:0%
confidential Telehealth services for
 
01:08:20.450 --> 01:08:20.460 align:start position:0%
students they cite that they may not be
 
01:08:22.370 --> 01:08:22.380 align:start position:0%
receiving enough or any support from
 
01:08:24.530 --> 01:08:24.540 align:start position:0%
parents or Guardians in other words they
 
01:08:26.809 --> 01:08:26.819 align:start position:0%
must go around them to provide these
 
01:08:30.349 --> 01:08:30.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:33.169 --> 01:08:33.179 align:start position:0%
moving on to the Third
 
01:08:36.050 --> 01:08:36.060 align:start position:0%
handout also from the American School
 
01:08:37.789 --> 01:08:37.799 align:start position:0%
Counselors Association I believe this
 
01:08:39.050 --> 01:08:39.060 align:start position:0%
one's even more important than the first
 
01:08:41.209 --> 01:08:41.219 align:start position:0%
one because this identifies the
 
01:08:43.610 --> 01:08:43.620 align:start position:0%
standards that they have developed the
 
01:08:43.620 --> 01:08:45.050 align:start position:0%
standards that they have developed the
competencies

01:08:45.050 --> 01:08:45.060 align:start position:0%
competencies
 
01:08:48.470 --> 01:08:48.480 align:start position:0%
for students under their care
 
01:08:50.150 --> 01:08:50.160 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of stuff you can look
 
01:08:51.890 --> 01:08:51.900 align:start position:0%
through here I've highlighted a number
 
01:08:53.689 --> 01:08:53.699 align:start position:0%
of things not not everything highlighted
 
01:08:55.249 --> 01:08:55.259 align:start position:0%
is necessarily bad or anything a lot of
 
01:08:56.630 --> 01:08:56.640 align:start position:0%
it's just interesting stuff worth
 
01:08:58.849 --> 01:08:58.859 align:start position:0%
looking more into but I would like to
 
01:09:01.130 --> 01:09:01.140 align:start position:0%
direct your attention to the lower right
 
01:09:03.169 --> 01:09:03.179 align:start position:0%
hand corner of the second page should be
 
01:09:04.930 --> 01:09:04.940 align:start position:0%
on the back
 
01:09:08.570 --> 01:09:08.580 align:start position:0%
bss10 cultural awareness sensitivity and
 
01:09:10.729 --> 01:09:10.739 align:start position:0%
responsiveness now if you go through the
 
01:09:12.349 --> 01:09:12.359 align:start position:0%
rest of this document there will be a
 
01:09:13.990 --> 01:09:14.000 align:start position:0%
lot of other
 
01:09:17.870 --> 01:09:17.880 align:start position:0%
references to that specific item so what
 
01:09:17.880 --> 01:09:18.769 align:start position:0%
references to that specific item so what
is

01:09:18.769 --> 01:09:18.779 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:09:20.570 --> 01:09:20.580 align:start position:0%
cultural learning sensitivity and
 
01:09:23.329 --> 01:09:23.339 align:start position:0%

01:09:27.229 --> 01:09:27.239 align:start position:0%

what is culturally responsive teaching
 
01:09:36.169 --> 01:09:36.179 align:start position:0%
again you're free to go through this top
 
01:09:37.970 --> 01:09:37.980 align:start position:0%
to bottom on your own we're just going
 
01:09:39.709 --> 01:09:39.719 align:start position:0%
to look at a couple highlights
 
01:09:43.789 --> 01:09:43.799 align:start position:0%
on the let's see here
 
01:09:47.030 --> 01:09:47.040 align:start position:0%
second page so on the back it identifies
 
01:09:49.630 --> 01:09:49.640 align:start position:0%
that a number of states have passed
 
01:09:52.370 --> 01:09:52.380 align:start position:0%
legislation seeking to prohibit the
 
01:09:53.990 --> 01:09:54.000 align:start position:0%
teaching of critical race theory in
 
01:09:56.810 --> 01:09:56.820 align:start position:0%
schools and it notes that that does in
 
01:09:59.510 --> 01:09:59.520 align:start position:0%
fact affect this cultural culturally
 
01:10:02.090 --> 01:10:02.100 align:start position:0%
responsive teaching
 
01:10:05.689 --> 01:10:05.699 align:start position:0%
going on to the next page
 
01:10:07.790 --> 01:10:07.800 align:start position:0%
it identifies the start of culturally
 
01:10:11.630 --> 01:10:11.640 align:start position:0%
responsive teaching as being the work of
 
01:10:15.530 --> 01:10:15.540 align:start position:0%

01:10:23.750 --> 01:10:23.760 align:start position:0%
it further identifies that this concept

perspectives
 
01:10:33.649 --> 01:10:33.659 align:start position:0%
all in all what this appears to be is
 
01:10:37.550 --> 01:10:37.560 align:start position:0%
teaching students to identify by race
 
01:10:40.970 --> 01:10:40.980 align:start position:0%
and class and other characteristics
 
01:10:43.310 --> 01:10:43.320 align:start position:0%

Consciousness derives from critical
 
01:11:00.550 --> 01:11:00.560 align:start position:0%
theory which was the work of neo-marxist
 
01:11:03.590 --> 01:11:03.600 align:start position:0%

moving on Lower in the page
 
01:11:14.590 --> 01:11:14.600 align:start position:0%
we see that this particular
 
01:11:18.290 --> 01:11:18.300 align:start position:0%
competency they're pushing it divides
 
01:11:20.689 --> 01:11:20.699 align:start position:0%

moving on even further to the next page
 
01:11:40.010 --> 01:11:40.020 align:start position:0%
we see that culturally responsive
 
01:11:41.750 --> 01:11:41.760 align:start position:0%
teachers must also consider the students

at the very bottom
 
01:12:00.530 --> 01:12:00.540 align:start position:0%
we identify for instance students and
 
01:12:02.990 --> 01:12:03.000 align:start position:0%
high school math class could learn about
 
01:12:04.850 --> 01:12:04.860 align:start position:0%
statistics by assessing the

data sets applicable to their
 
01:12:13.010 --> 01:12:13.020 align:start position:0%

about Justice and Injustice

01:12:34.870 --> 01:12:34.880 align:start position:0%
handout 5 is just further
 
01:12:37.490 --> 01:12:37.500 align:start position:0%
clarification on exactly where this
 
01:12:40.729 --> 01:12:40.739 align:start position:0%
Theory and ideas come from
 
01:12:44.090 --> 01:12:44.100 align:start position:0%
and further evidence on page six out of
 
01:12:47.570 --> 01:12:47.580 align:start position:0%
the University of California Fresno we
 
01:12:49.370 --> 01:12:49.380 align:start position:0%
have heard about why is compassionate
 
01:12:50.990 --> 01:12:51.000 align:start position:0%
framework before this is a term that's
 
01:12:53.689 --> 01:12:53.699 align:start position:0%
come up a number of different times
 
01:12:55.790 --> 01:12:55.800 align:start position:0%
why is compassionate framework in
 
01:12:57.790 --> 01:12:57.800 align:start position:0%
teaching health education in schools
 
01:13:02.410 --> 01:13:02.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:05.209 --> 01:13:05.219 align:start position:0%

01:13:08.590 --> 01:13:08.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:11.330 --> 01:13:11.340 align:start position:0%
trauma-informed practices social justice

responsibility and evidence-based
 
01:13:13.679 --> 01:13:15.229 align:start position:0%
responsibility and evidence-based
research

01:13:15.229 --> 01:13:15.239 align:start position:0%
research
 
01:13:17.990 --> 01:13:18.000 align:start position:0%
so I think this really gives us a little
 
01:13:21.229 --> 01:13:21.239 align:start position:0%
bit of an idea of where the door to
 
01:13:23.810 --> 01:13:23.820 align:start position:0%
mental health education of students is
 
01:13:24.950 --> 01:13:24.960 align:start position:0%
open to
 
01:13:29.470 --> 01:13:29.480 align:start position:0%
particularly from the closest current
 
01:13:31.669 --> 01:13:31.679 align:start position:0%
professional association being the
 
01:13:34.130 --> 01:13:34.140 align:start position:0%
student Counselors Association
 
01:13:35.630 --> 01:13:35.640 align:start position:0%
thank you you have a question
 
01:13:38.630 --> 01:13:38.640 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli thank you
 
01:13:41.330 --> 01:13:41.340 align:start position:0%
um you know I will take a closer look at
 
01:13:44.030 --> 01:13:44.040 align:start position:0%
the school counselor information but
 
01:13:47.930 --> 01:13:47.940 align:start position:0%
perhaps you can explain how the rest of
 
01:13:49.610 --> 01:13:49.620 align:start position:0%
these documents like the culturally
 
01:13:52.970 --> 01:13:52.980 align:start position:0%
responsive teaching is related to the
 
01:13:55.189 --> 01:13:55.199 align:start position:0%
legislation that we are discussing well
 
01:13:57.709 --> 01:13:57.719 align:start position:0%
I think before we get into another you
 
01:13:59.689 --> 01:13:59.699 align:start position:0%
know 25 minutes and trying to find all
 
01:14:01.850 --> 01:14:01.860 align:start position:0%
that I think we need to stick to the
 
01:14:04.189 --> 01:14:04.199 align:start position:0%
topic and which is there's three words
 
01:14:06.169 --> 01:14:06.179 align:start position:0%
that have been are for that have been
 
01:14:08.330 --> 01:14:08.340 align:start position:0%
put into this legislation comprehensive
 
01:14:11.390 --> 01:14:11.400 align:start position:0%
mental health education that's that's it
 
01:14:13.550 --> 01:14:13.560 align:start position:0%
underneath studies
 
01:14:13.560 --> 01:14:15.110 align:start position:0%
underneath studies
so

01:14:15.110 --> 01:14:15.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:14:17.450 --> 01:14:17.460 align:start position:0%
um I'd rather not get into that right
 
01:14:19.850 --> 01:14:19.860 align:start position:0%
now and I'd like to try to get
 
01:14:22.130 --> 01:14:22.140 align:start position:0%
when we initially had this bill here
 
01:14:25.189 --> 01:14:25.199 align:start position:0%
there was a concern do we call this
 
01:14:27.050 --> 01:14:27.060 align:start position:0%
comprehensive mental health education or
 
01:14:29.810 --> 01:14:29.820 align:start position:0%
mental health education uh then we saw
 
01:14:32.330 --> 01:14:32.340 align:start position:0%
mental health written in ed306 it's also
 
01:14:34.370 --> 01:14:34.380 align:start position:0%
within the Frameworks which were
 
01:14:36.830 --> 01:14:36.840 align:start position:0%
required to be teaching right now the
 
01:14:39.470 --> 01:14:39.480 align:start position:0%
reason why you see the uh what they've
 
01:14:43.130 --> 01:14:43.140 align:start position:0%
done in Texas uh before you at the
 
01:14:45.649 --> 01:14:45.659 align:start position:0%
bottom of that first page it gives a
 
01:14:48.110 --> 01:14:48.120 align:start position:0%
definition as to what comprehensive
 
01:14:50.990 --> 01:14:51.000 align:start position:0%
mental health is this is coming out of a
 
01:14:52.970 --> 01:14:52.980 align:start position:0%
pretty conservative state
 
01:14:55.430 --> 01:14:55.440 align:start position:0%
and you can see that they it says
 
01:14:56.750 --> 01:14:56.760 align:start position:0%
comprehensive School Mental Health
 
01:14:58.910 --> 01:14:58.920 align:start position:0%
Systems provide a Continuum of services
 
01:15:02.209 --> 01:15:02.219 align:start position:0%
and supports intended to and you see the
 
01:15:04.550 --> 01:15:04.560 align:start position:0%
bullets in the back page promote a
 
01:15:06.770 --> 01:15:06.780 align:start position:0%
positive School climate teach and
 
01:15:08.570 --> 01:15:08.580 align:start position:0%
support skills for social emotional
 
01:15:10.850 --> 01:15:10.860 align:start position:0%
Behavioral Health prevent mental health
 
01:15:13.370 --> 01:15:13.380 align:start position:0%
and substance use problems intervene
 
01:15:15.470 --> 01:15:15.480 align:start position:0%
early to reduce the severity of mental
 
01:15:17.930 --> 01:15:17.940 align:start position:0%
health concerns and the last one provide
 
01:15:19.669 --> 01:15:19.679 align:start position:0%
access to school-based and
 
01:15:21.530 --> 01:15:21.540 align:start position:0%
community-based interventions and sports
 
01:15:24.050 --> 01:15:24.060 align:start position:0%
to students and families and you get
 
01:15:25.630 --> 01:15:25.640 align:start position:0%
down a little lower they talk about the
 
01:15:28.490 --> 01:15:28.500 align:start position:0%
mtss which is the multi-tiered system of
 
01:15:31.189 --> 01:15:31.199 align:start position:0%
support which I think we have something
 
01:15:33.890 --> 01:15:33.900 align:start position:0%
very similar that operating in our state
 
01:15:37.790 --> 01:15:37.800 align:start position:0%
right now so that's their definition and
 
01:15:39.530 --> 01:15:39.540 align:start position:0%
I'd like to stay you know somewhere
 
01:15:42.010 --> 01:15:42.020 align:start position:0%
along the ballpark of what I just read
 
01:15:45.229 --> 01:15:45.239 align:start position:0%
because that seems to me is what we're
 
01:15:47.870 --> 01:15:47.880 align:start position:0%
dealing with and in my discussions with
 
01:15:50.810 --> 01:15:50.820 align:start position:0%
many superintendents now there appears
 
01:15:51.950 --> 01:15:51.960 align:start position:0%
to be
 
01:15:54.950 --> 01:15:54.960 align:start position:0%
a need for looking at mental health or
 
01:15:56.810 --> 01:15:56.820 align:start position:0%
comprehensive mental health and the
 
01:15:58.250 --> 01:15:58.260 align:start position:0%
conditions the students are coming to
 
01:16:00.350 --> 01:16:00.360 align:start position:0%
school in right now and some of the
 
01:16:02.090 --> 01:16:02.100 align:start position:0%
really issues in the classroom the
 
01:16:03.830 --> 01:16:03.840 align:start position:0%
teachers are having to address and deal
 
01:16:03.840 --> 01:16:04.790 align:start position:0%
teachers are having to address and deal
with

01:16:04.790 --> 01:16:04.800 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:16:07.910 --> 01:16:07.920 align:start position:0%
so representative Damon
 
01:16:10.070 --> 01:16:10.080 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
01:16:13.490 --> 01:16:13.500 align:start position:0%
particularly for framing the discussion
 
01:16:16.630 --> 01:16:16.640 align:start position:0%
around what this bill proposes to do
 
01:16:20.510 --> 01:16:20.520 align:start position:0%
which is mental health education
 
01:16:23.030 --> 01:16:23.040 align:start position:0%
I would very respectfully ask my
 
01:16:25.010 --> 01:16:25.020 align:start position:0%
colleagues to carefully distinguish
 
01:16:27.950 --> 01:16:27.960 align:start position:0%
between education and treatment
 
01:16:30.649 --> 01:16:30.659 align:start position:0%
they are not the same thing that would
 
01:16:31.970 --> 01:16:31.980 align:start position:0%
be true whether we were talking about
 
01:16:35.149 --> 01:16:35.159 align:start position:0%
physical health mental health or
 
01:16:35.159 --> 01:16:37.250 align:start position:0%
physical health mental health or
whatever

01:16:37.250 --> 01:16:37.260 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
01:16:41.270 --> 01:16:41.280 align:start position:0%
I see this bill as a necessary statement
 
01:16:44.630 --> 01:16:44.640 align:start position:0%
of requiring that we educate our
 
01:16:44.640 --> 01:16:45.709 align:start position:0%
of requiring that we educate our
students

01:16:45.709 --> 01:16:45.719 align:start position:0%
students
 
01:16:48.110 --> 01:16:48.120 align:start position:0%
about conditions of mental health so
 
01:16:49.490 --> 01:16:49.500 align:start position:0%
that they learn
 
01:16:53.209 --> 01:16:53.219 align:start position:0%
protective factors risk factors and
 
01:16:54.950 --> 01:16:54.960 align:start position:0%
where help would be available should
 
01:16:57.649 --> 01:16:57.659 align:start position:0%
they or folks they know need it
 
01:16:59.950 --> 01:16:59.960 align:start position:0%
it is not about providing treatment
 
01:17:03.290 --> 01:17:03.300 align:start position:0%
that's part of mental health system but
 
01:17:05.630 --> 01:17:05.640 align:start position:0%
it's not education
 
01:17:08.630 --> 01:17:08.640 align:start position:0%
if I parallel it to a physical condition
 
01:17:13.189 --> 01:17:13.199 align:start position:0%
if we teach students what diabetes is
 
01:17:15.709 --> 01:17:15.719 align:start position:0%
what symptoms would suggest that you
 
01:17:17.689 --> 01:17:17.699 align:start position:0%
might want to get evaluated for diabetes
 
01:17:20.390 --> 01:17:20.400 align:start position:0%
we're not treating them if they do turn
 
01:17:21.770 --> 01:17:21.780 align:start position:0%
out to have diabetes they will be
 
01:17:23.830 --> 01:17:23.840 align:start position:0%
treated in the Health Care system
 
01:17:27.350 --> 01:17:27.360 align:start position:0%
similarly if we teach students what the
 
01:17:29.750 --> 01:17:29.760 align:start position:0%
warning signs of depression or anxiety
 
01:17:32.090 --> 01:17:32.100 align:start position:0%
disorder are we're not treating them
 
01:17:34.010 --> 01:17:34.020 align:start position:0%
we're informing them that these
 
01:17:35.510 --> 01:17:35.520 align:start position:0%
conditions exist
 
01:17:37.970 --> 01:17:37.980 align:start position:0%
and that because they're common
 
01:17:41.149 --> 01:17:41.159 align:start position:0%
it is part of their education to be
 
01:17:43.729 --> 01:17:43.739 align:start position:0%
aware of them and informed for future
 
01:17:43.739 --> 01:17:45.290 align:start position:0%
aware of them and informed for future
reference

01:17:45.290 --> 01:17:45.300 align:start position:0%
reference
 
01:17:48.410 --> 01:17:48.420 align:start position:0%
so I really urge people try diligently
 
01:17:50.689 --> 01:17:50.699 align:start position:0%
pleased to distinguish between education
 
01:17:52.250 --> 01:17:52.260 align:start position:0%
and treatment
 
01:17:54.830 --> 01:17:54.840 align:start position:0%
this bill does not propose that schools
 
01:17:57.110 --> 01:17:57.120 align:start position:0%
be treating mental health it proposes
 
01:17:59.390 --> 01:17:59.400 align:start position:0%
that we be educating about it
 
01:18:02.209 --> 01:18:02.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:02.219 --> 01:18:04.490 align:start position:0%
 
representative

01:18:04.490 --> 01:18:04.500 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:18:06.890 --> 01:18:06.900 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chair and thanks
 
01:18:09.890 --> 01:18:09.900 align:start position:0%
for for getting us back on track on here
 
01:18:12.290 --> 01:18:12.300 align:start position:0%
and I think uh representative Damon said
 
01:18:15.050 --> 01:18:15.060 align:start position:0%
it very well what um some of your
 
01:18:19.310 --> 01:18:19.320 align:start position:0%
remarks Rick and and hope reminded me of
 
01:18:23.090 --> 01:18:23.100 align:start position:0%
a um a speaker that that many of us I
 
01:18:26.870 --> 01:18:26.880 align:start position:0%
think may have heard last summer at CSG
 
01:18:30.050 --> 01:18:30.060 align:start position:0%
East which was hosted in Manchester and
 
01:18:32.630 --> 01:18:32.640 align:start position:0%
they had a speaker who's the president
 
01:18:34.390 --> 01:18:34.400 align:start position:0%
of Bank of America
 
01:18:38.390 --> 01:18:38.400 align:start position:0%
based out of Connecticut and uh and he
 
01:18:38.400 --> 01:18:41.209 align:start position:0%
based out of Connecticut and uh and he
was

01:18:41.209 --> 01:18:41.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:43.570 --> 01:18:43.580 align:start position:0%
he was really up there to speak about
 
01:18:45.709 --> 01:18:45.719 align:start position:0%
internships and and Workforce
 
01:18:48.649 --> 01:18:48.659 align:start position:0%
Development and uh and he said but I'll
 
01:18:51.110 --> 01:18:51.120 align:start position:0%
tell you I'll tell you this is this is
 
01:18:53.630 --> 01:18:53.640 align:start position:0%
you know a room full of legislators from
 
01:18:55.370 --> 01:18:55.380 align:start position:0%
across the country including a lot from
 
01:18:57.649 --> 01:18:57.659 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and goes I'll tell you the
 
01:19:00.189 --> 01:19:00.199 align:start position:0%
biggest the biggest thing where where
 
01:19:04.490 --> 01:19:04.500 align:start position:0%
concerned that we're seeing among
 
01:19:07.610 --> 01:19:07.620 align:start position:0%
um uh interns that we take you know out
 
01:19:10.669 --> 01:19:10.679 align:start position:0%
of out of high school is
 
01:19:14.149 --> 01:19:14.159 align:start position:0%
um is is mental health and and he said
 
01:19:18.050 --> 01:19:18.060 align:start position:0%
it and it has it has dropped on us like
 
01:19:20.390 --> 01:19:20.400 align:start position:0%
a ton of bricks right now and it's not
 
01:19:23.330 --> 01:19:23.340 align:start position:0%
something that had really um been on
 
01:19:26.330 --> 01:19:26.340 align:start position:0%
their radar screen several years ago but
 
01:19:30.830 --> 01:19:30.840 align:start position:0%
absolutely was as a as an employer as a
 
01:19:33.010 --> 01:19:33.020 align:start position:0%
um uh someone that run that that
 
01:19:35.750 --> 01:19:35.760 align:start position:0%
supervises interns in their in their
 
01:19:37.550 --> 01:19:37.560 align:start position:0%
business and
 
01:19:39.830 --> 01:19:39.840 align:start position:0%
um and again the president Bank of New
 
01:19:43.310 --> 01:19:43.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and he said please please do
 
01:19:46.189 --> 01:19:46.199 align:start position:0%
something about uh bringing this to uh
 
01:19:48.590 --> 01:19:48.600 align:start position:0%
to light in your in your public schools
 
01:19:51.350 --> 01:19:51.360 align:start position:0%
and talking about it and eliminating the
 
01:19:54.229 --> 01:19:54.239 align:start position:0%
stigma about it so that um
 
01:19:57.410 --> 01:19:57.420 align:start position:0%
so that people could um could could
 
01:20:05.570 --> 01:20:05.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:08.030 --> 01:20:08.040 align:start position:0%
well that's old-fashioned it right
 
01:20:10.790 --> 01:20:10.800 align:start position:0%
represent Danner
 
01:20:12.290 --> 01:20:12.300 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:20:14.689 --> 01:20:14.699 align:start position:0%
um I'm just asking a question about
 
01:20:14.699 --> 01:20:15.290 align:start position:0%
um I'm just asking a question about
um

01:20:15.290 --> 01:20:15.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:18.470 --> 01:20:18.480 align:start position:0%
the bill as it's written and
 
01:20:20.930 --> 01:20:20.940 align:start position:0%
um looking at uh the page that you
 
01:20:25.370 --> 01:20:25.380 align:start position:0%
handed out with 189 colon 10 studies
 
01:20:29.810 --> 01:20:29.820 align:start position:0%
um this there's a lot more in 189 10
 
01:20:32.810 --> 01:20:32.820 align:start position:0%
then uh is in this first and second
 
01:20:32.820 --> 01:20:34.610 align:start position:0%
then uh is in this first and second
paragraph

01:20:34.610 --> 01:20:34.620 align:start position:0%
paragraph
 
01:20:38.030 --> 01:20:38.040 align:start position:0%
um are we proposing to
 
01:20:38.040 --> 01:20:39.890 align:start position:0%
um are we proposing to
change

01:20:39.890 --> 01:20:39.900 align:start position:0%
change
 
01:20:44.149 --> 01:20:44.159 align:start position:0%
this particular 189 10 sections one and
 
01:20:44.159 --> 01:20:45.830 align:start position:0%
this particular 189 10 sections one and
two

01:20:45.830 --> 01:20:45.840 align:start position:0%
two
 
01:20:47.209 --> 01:20:47.219 align:start position:0%
um and actually they have a section
 
01:20:47.219 --> 01:20:48.470 align:start position:0%
um and actually they have a section
three

01:20:48.470 --> 01:20:48.480 align:start position:0%
three
 
01:20:51.350 --> 01:20:51.360 align:start position:0%
by eliminating those and just uh
 
01:20:53.390 --> 01:20:53.400 align:start position:0%
inserting this is that is that the
 
01:20:55.610 --> 01:20:55.620 align:start position:0%
intention of this law of this particular
 
01:20:57.410 --> 01:20:57.420 align:start position:0%
I think the way this is written
 
01:20:59.149 --> 01:20:59.159 align:start position:0%
representative Tanner is that it's just
 
01:21:03.649 --> 01:21:03.659 align:start position:0%
adding to that Roman 2 the four words
 
01:21:05.450 --> 01:21:05.460 align:start position:0%
comprehensive mental health education
 
01:21:07.910 --> 01:21:07.920 align:start position:0%
and not doing anything to any any other
 
01:21:12.110 --> 01:21:12.120 align:start position:0%
statute of legislation that's in place
 
01:21:13.850 --> 01:21:13.860 align:start position:0%
there's no other changes there's no
 
01:21:13.860 --> 01:21:16.430 align:start position:0%
there's no other changes there's no
deletion

01:21:16.430 --> 01:21:16.440 align:start position:0%
deletion
 
01:21:19.850 --> 01:21:19.860 align:start position:0%
according to exercise of other Roman
 
01:21:21.649 --> 01:21:21.659 align:start position:0%
numerals which might appear I I don't
 
01:21:23.450 --> 01:21:23.460 align:start position:0%
have that law in front of me I'm looking
 
01:21:25.430 --> 01:21:25.440 align:start position:0%
at just the background there's a section
 
01:21:28.070 --> 01:21:28.080 align:start position:0%
three with a personal financial literacy
 
01:21:30.830 --> 01:21:30.840 align:start position:0%
yeah that remains that remains there
 
01:21:33.709 --> 01:21:33.719 align:start position:0%
that doesn't go anywhere and then it has
 
01:21:37.189 --> 01:21:37.199 align:start position:0%
three the C 306 rules which
 
01:21:40.070 --> 01:21:40.080 align:start position:0%
um you know are the the course in high
 
01:21:41.930 --> 01:21:41.940 align:start position:0%
school that I taught in health was a
 
01:21:44.390 --> 01:21:44.400 align:start position:0%
quarter credit it was you know one
 
01:21:49.490 --> 01:21:49.500 align:start position:0%
marking period uh for you know 45
 
01:21:53.030 --> 01:21:53.040 align:start position:0%
minutes a day five days and to actually
 
01:21:55.310 --> 01:21:55.320 align:start position:0%
achieve all these things
 
01:21:57.169 --> 01:21:57.179 align:start position:0%
um would be very difficult although
 
01:21:58.970 --> 01:21:58.980 align:start position:0%
they're all integrated you know
 
01:22:00.590 --> 01:22:00.600 align:start position:0%
everything's kind of integrated in
 
01:22:03.050 --> 01:22:03.060 align:start position:0%
itself like physiology can't be
 
01:22:05.510 --> 01:22:05.520 align:start position:0%
separated from what you're teaching when
 
01:22:07.490 --> 01:22:07.500 align:start position:0%
you're teaching Health but
 
01:22:10.990 --> 01:22:11.000 align:start position:0%
um or PE but um
 
01:22:14.990 --> 01:22:15.000 align:start position:0%
even in the 306 rules it actually uh
 
01:22:18.830 --> 01:22:18.840 align:start position:0%
under part two G it has mental health
 
01:22:21.530 --> 01:22:21.540 align:start position:0%
um so you know it isn't that we aren't
 
01:22:24.709 --> 01:22:24.719 align:start position:0%
doing it already it's I you know I just
 
01:22:27.169 --> 01:22:27.179 align:start position:0%
think these bills are pointing out that
 
01:22:29.330 --> 01:22:29.340 align:start position:0%
we have a mental health crisis and with
 
01:22:33.470 --> 01:22:33.480 align:start position:0%
kids and I we're all aware of that and I
 
01:22:36.470 --> 01:22:36.480 align:start position:0%
think schools are are extremely aware of
 
01:22:37.910 --> 01:22:37.920 align:start position:0%
it now
 
01:22:40.370 --> 01:22:40.380 align:start position:0%
um as are the communities and and I
 
01:22:41.689 --> 01:22:41.699 align:start position:0%
appreciate the fact that people are
 
01:22:43.130 --> 01:22:43.140 align:start position:0%
putting in
 
01:22:46.430 --> 01:22:46.440 align:start position:0%
bills to try to highlight it but it's
 
01:22:47.930 --> 01:22:47.940 align:start position:0%
already there
 
01:22:50.209 --> 01:22:50.219 align:start position:0%
um so
 
01:22:52.790 --> 01:22:52.800 align:start position:0%
yes it definitely is already identified
 
01:22:55.010 --> 01:22:55.020 align:start position:0%
in a number of places
 
01:22:55.020 --> 01:22:57.229 align:start position:0%
in a number of places
um

01:22:57.229 --> 01:22:57.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:58.930 --> 01:22:58.940 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
01:23:02.149 --> 01:23:02.159 align:start position:0%
no you represent paranol you haven't
 
01:23:05.270 --> 01:23:05.280 align:start position:0%
spoken yet on this this one
 
01:23:07.430 --> 01:23:07.440 align:start position:0%
and then representative cascadden thank
 
01:23:09.110 --> 01:23:09.120 align:start position:0%
you um
 
01:23:11.149 --> 01:23:11.159 align:start position:0%
am I correct this health education
 
01:23:14.390 --> 01:23:14.400 align:start position:0%
curriculum guidelines is from 2003 yes
 
01:23:16.430 --> 01:23:16.440 align:start position:0%
so it's 20 years old
 
01:23:18.770 --> 01:23:18.780 align:start position:0%
yeah and our social studies was written
 
01:23:21.890 --> 01:23:21.900 align:start position:0%
in 2006 so it's just about as old well
 
01:23:25.130 --> 01:23:25.140 align:start position:0%
our second page it says page five number
 
01:23:27.110 --> 01:23:27.120 align:start position:0%
one is health education
 
01:23:30.290 --> 01:23:30.300 align:start position:0%
and if you go down to the the second
 
01:23:32.930 --> 01:23:32.940 align:start position:0%
line well I'll read it a planned
 
01:23:35.330 --> 01:23:35.340 align:start position:0%
sequential K-12 program that addresses
 
01:23:39.530 --> 01:23:39.540 align:start position:0%
the physical mental emotional and social
 
01:23:41.510 --> 01:23:41.520 align:start position:0%
dimensions of Health
 
01:23:44.510 --> 01:23:44.520 align:start position:0%
and then go down further reduce health
 
01:23:47.390 --> 01:23:47.400 align:start position:0%
related risk behaviors I would say we've
 
01:23:49.669 --> 01:23:49.679 align:start position:0%
been covering this at least for 20 years
 
01:23:51.649 --> 01:23:51.659 align:start position:0%
so I'm kind of questioning the necessity
 
01:23:52.910 --> 01:23:52.920 align:start position:0%
of this
 
01:23:56.030 --> 01:23:56.040 align:start position:0%
particular bill yeah and then if you
 
01:23:57.590 --> 01:23:57.600 align:start position:0%
look internally you would find a whole
 
01:24:00.110 --> 01:24:00.120 align:start position:0%
section on Mental Health within it
 
01:24:00.120 --> 01:24:03.610 align:start position:0%
section on Mental Health within it
um

01:24:03.610 --> 01:24:03.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:06.169 --> 01:24:06.179 align:start position:0%
representative and then representative
 
01:24:08.689 --> 01:24:08.699 align:start position:0%
cardelli thank you
 
01:24:08.699 --> 01:24:09.709 align:start position:0%
cardelli thank you
um

01:24:09.709 --> 01:24:09.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:24:12.290 --> 01:24:12.300 align:start position:0%
the language in this bill the words
 
01:24:15.169 --> 01:24:15.179 align:start position:0%
comprehensive in education make me
 
01:24:17.270 --> 01:24:17.280 align:start position:0%
nervous because it gives the perception
 
01:24:20.830 --> 01:24:20.840 align:start position:0%
now that there'll be
 
01:24:24.110 --> 01:24:24.120 align:start position:0%
specific learning
 
01:24:26.870 --> 01:24:26.880 align:start position:0%
of mental health or for mental health
 
01:24:26.880 --> 01:24:28.430 align:start position:0%
of mental health or for mental health
students

01:24:28.430 --> 01:24:28.440 align:start position:0%
students
 
01:24:28.440 --> 01:24:30.110 align:start position:0%
students
um

01:24:30.110 --> 01:24:30.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:24:32.450 --> 01:24:32.460 align:start position:0%
I I don't understand
 
01:24:34.430 --> 01:24:34.440 align:start position:0%
why we just don't have mental health
 
01:24:36.830 --> 01:24:36.840 align:start position:0%
like we do I think we have it in the law
 
01:24:38.630 --> 01:24:38.640 align:start position:0%
or we have it we have it identified
 
01:24:41.510 --> 01:24:41.520 align:start position:0%
already in the 306s
 
01:24:43.850 --> 01:24:43.860 align:start position:0%
but this work schools have recognized
 
01:24:45.790 --> 01:24:45.800 align:start position:0%
that this is an issue quite a while ago
 
01:24:48.410 --> 01:24:48.420 align:start position:0%
because there have been initiatives
 
01:24:51.470 --> 01:24:51.480 align:start position:0%
through this office of Wellness which
 
01:24:54.709 --> 01:24:54.719 align:start position:0%
came about because of some of this
 
01:24:57.830 --> 01:24:57.840 align:start position:0%
um 10 years ago again schools went to
 
01:24:59.990 --> 01:25:00.000 align:start position:0%
positive behavioral intervention
 
01:25:02.870 --> 01:25:02.880 align:start position:0%
supports it was Project aware that was
 
01:25:05.990 --> 01:25:06.000 align:start position:0%
building resilience among kids
 
01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:06.590 align:start position:0%
building resilience among kids
um

01:25:06.590 --> 01:25:06.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:25:09.290 --> 01:25:09.300 align:start position:0%
the thing is the school
 
01:25:11.689 --> 01:25:11.699 align:start position:0%
should not be perceived as the place
 
01:25:14.270 --> 01:25:14.280 align:start position:0%
that's going to cure someone with a
 
01:25:16.130 --> 01:25:16.140 align:start position:0%
mental health disorder
 
01:25:19.130 --> 01:25:19.140 align:start position:0%
it needs to be one piece of the puzzle
 
01:25:21.350 --> 01:25:21.360 align:start position:0%
because a child will spend five or six
 
01:25:22.610 --> 01:25:22.620 align:start position:0%
hours there
 
01:25:24.890 --> 01:25:24.900 align:start position:0%
so behavior is important
 
01:25:29.149 --> 01:25:29.159 align:start position:0%
there has to be a connection in a
 
01:25:31.910 --> 01:25:31.920 align:start position:0%
relationship with Community Health
 
01:25:34.090 --> 01:25:34.100 align:start position:0%
physical health
 
01:25:36.350 --> 01:25:36.360 align:start position:0%
mental health professionals in the
 
01:25:38.870 --> 01:25:38.880 align:start position:0%
community or in the region but there has
 
01:25:41.930 --> 01:25:41.940 align:start position:0%
to be a Continuum of services and it's
 
01:25:44.689 --> 01:25:44.699 align:start position:0%
not just the school and I fear that
 
01:25:47.630 --> 01:25:47.640 align:start position:0%
because this now comes as a new
 
01:25:49.490 --> 01:25:49.500 align:start position:0%
a new bill
 
01:25:52.250 --> 01:25:52.260 align:start position:0%
the schools now need to take on curing
 
01:25:54.110 --> 01:25:54.120 align:start position:0%
mental health issues
 
01:25:56.890 --> 01:25:56.900 align:start position:0%
and it really should not be
 
01:25:59.750 --> 01:25:59.760 align:start position:0%
separated out again as a mental health
 
01:26:03.169 --> 01:26:03.179 align:start position:0%
issue because kids come to school with
 
01:26:05.570 --> 01:26:05.580 align:start position:0%
other emotional and Behavioral
 
01:26:09.229 --> 01:26:09.239 align:start position:0%
issues and some students have their
 
01:26:12.649 --> 01:26:12.659 align:start position:0%
mental health very well under control
 
01:26:14.870 --> 01:26:14.880 align:start position:0%
you know so
 
01:26:17.090 --> 01:26:17.100 align:start position:0%
I don't like separating that out I think
 
01:26:19.990 --> 01:26:20.000 align:start position:0%
that puts labels on kids
 
01:26:24.110 --> 01:26:24.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:26.209 --> 01:26:26.219 align:start position:0%
um I lost my train I thought schools
 
01:26:28.010 --> 01:26:28.020 align:start position:0%
have gone
 
01:26:30.830 --> 01:26:30.840 align:start position:0%
from detentions
 
01:26:33.350 --> 01:26:33.360 align:start position:0%
to student support centers
 
01:26:35.450 --> 01:26:35.460 align:start position:0%
in their schools which is part of the
 
01:26:37.550 --> 01:26:37.560 align:start position:0%
structure that if a student needs a time
 
01:26:37.560 --> 01:26:38.870 align:start position:0%
structure that if a student needs a time
out

01:26:38.870 --> 01:26:38.880 align:start position:0%
out
 
01:26:42.010 --> 01:26:42.020 align:start position:0%
he might go to a student Support Center
 
01:26:44.750 --> 01:26:44.760 align:start position:0%
I'd be curious to know
 
01:26:47.570 --> 01:26:47.580 align:start position:0%
maybe the office of Wellness you know at
 
01:26:50.870 --> 01:26:50.880 align:start position:0%
the doe can find out how many schools
 
01:26:54.530 --> 01:26:54.540 align:start position:0%
already have a multi-tiered systems of
 
01:26:56.930 --> 01:26:56.940 align:start position:0%
support for emotional behavioral and
 
01:26:58.850 --> 01:26:58.860 align:start position:0%
mental health conditions
 
01:27:01.209 --> 01:27:01.219 align:start position:0%
but I think if there's any language
 
01:27:03.590 --> 01:27:03.600 align:start position:0%
comprehensive in education should come
 
01:27:05.169 --> 01:27:05.179 align:start position:0%
out because
 
01:27:07.729 --> 01:27:07.739 align:start position:0%
it's already being done
 
01:27:10.129 --> 01:27:10.139 align:start position:0%
and to what extent should the school be
 
01:27:12.290 --> 01:27:12.300 align:start position:0%
dealing with mental health
 
01:27:16.550 --> 01:27:16.560 align:start position:0%
I mean it's not in their purview to
 
01:27:18.950 --> 01:27:18.960 align:start position:0%
sort of change that
 
01:27:20.870 --> 01:27:20.880 align:start position:0%
it's their responsibility to make sure
 
01:27:23.750 --> 01:27:23.760 align:start position:0%
that the student is safe
 
01:27:25.790 --> 01:27:25.800 align:start position:0%
in a learning environment
 
01:27:27.950 --> 01:27:27.960 align:start position:0%
and so it's a different
 
01:27:30.169 --> 01:27:30.179 align:start position:0%
to me it's a different picture
 
01:27:30.179 --> 01:27:31.310 align:start position:0%
to me it's a different picture
but

01:27:31.310 --> 01:27:31.320 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:27:31.320 --> 01:27:32.570 align:start position:0%
but
um

01:27:32.570 --> 01:27:32.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:27:34.550 --> 01:27:34.560 align:start position:0%
I think the curriculum and the education
 
01:27:37.790 --> 01:27:37.800 align:start position:0%
about it is is already there in the
 
01:27:39.350 --> 01:27:39.360 align:start position:0%
health curriculum
 
01:27:41.930 --> 01:27:41.940 align:start position:0%
but one piece that I can remember adding
 
01:27:43.970 --> 01:27:43.980 align:start position:0%
was training staff and being able to
 
01:27:43.980 --> 01:27:44.990 align:start position:0%
was training staff and being able to
recognize

01:27:44.990 --> 01:27:45.000 align:start position:0%
recognize
 
01:27:47.209 --> 01:27:47.219 align:start position:0%
mental health disorders
 
01:27:49.850 --> 01:27:49.860 align:start position:0%
and that was through the training of all
 
01:27:51.830 --> 01:27:51.840 align:start position:0%
staff and youth Mental Health First Aid
 
01:27:54.709 --> 01:27:54.719 align:start position:0%
Just Like You Train everybody annual in
 
01:27:54.719 --> 01:27:56.629 align:start position:0%
Just Like You Train everybody annual in
bullying

01:27:56.629 --> 01:27:56.639 align:start position:0%
bullying
 
01:27:59.689 --> 01:27:59.699 align:start position:0%
um You Train everybody annually and some
 
01:28:02.209 --> 01:28:02.219 align:start position:0%
other requirements but I think that
 
01:28:04.430 --> 01:28:04.440 align:start position:0%
would be a key factor to add
 
01:28:07.310 --> 01:28:07.320 align:start position:0%
to at least train all staff people in
 
01:28:09.350 --> 01:28:09.360 align:start position:0%
recognizing that to so that they can
 
01:28:09.360 --> 01:28:11.930 align:start position:0%
recognizing that to so that they can
refer

01:28:11.930 --> 01:28:11.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:14.209 --> 01:28:14.219 align:start position:0%
um you know students and help the
 
01:28:16.490 --> 01:28:16.500 align:start position:0%
student but not cure it it's not their
 
01:28:16.500 --> 01:28:18.649 align:start position:0%
student but not cure it it's not their
job

01:28:18.649 --> 01:28:18.659 align:start position:0%
job
 
01:28:20.570 --> 01:28:20.580 align:start position:0%
representative I completely agree with
 
01:28:22.910 --> 01:28:22.920 align:start position:0%
representative Cass cat and on that on
 
01:28:23.990 --> 01:28:24.000 align:start position:0%
the staff
 
01:28:26.450 --> 01:28:26.460 align:start position:0%
being trained better
 
01:28:28.970 --> 01:28:28.980 align:start position:0%
um I have a family member with a mental
 
01:28:31.310 --> 01:28:31.320 align:start position:0%
illness if I thought for a minute that
 
01:28:33.129 --> 01:28:33.139 align:start position:0%
this sort of thing would have helped her
 
01:28:37.370 --> 01:28:37.380 align:start position:0%
with her situation I'd be all for it but
 
01:28:40.189 --> 01:28:40.199 align:start position:0%
I don't think it would have and we're
 
01:28:43.070 --> 01:28:43.080 align:start position:0%
already feeling apparently we're already
 
01:28:44.930 --> 01:28:44.940 align:start position:0%
addressing these issues I don't like
 
01:28:47.450 --> 01:28:47.460 align:start position:0%
this phrase comprehensive mental health
 
01:28:47.460 --> 01:28:49.970 align:start position:0%
this phrase comprehensive mental health
education

01:28:49.970 --> 01:28:49.980 align:start position:0%
education
 
01:28:52.490 --> 01:28:52.500 align:start position:0%
either I want to thank representative
 
01:28:54.890 --> 01:28:54.900 align:start position:0%
Belcher for these handouts which are
 
01:28:57.290 --> 01:28:57.300 align:start position:0%
relevant he brings up very complicated
 
01:28:59.390 --> 01:28:59.400 align:start position:0%
issues regarding regarding Marxist
 
01:28:59.400 --> 01:29:01.189 align:start position:0%
issues regarding regarding Marxist
ideology

01:29:01.189 --> 01:29:01.199 align:start position:0%
ideology
 
01:29:03.649 --> 01:29:03.659 align:start position:0%
um and the fact the American school
 
01:29:05.450 --> 01:29:05.460 align:start position:0%
counselor Association
 
01:29:07.189 --> 01:29:07.199 align:start position:0%
seems to
 
01:29:08.990 --> 01:29:09.000 align:start position:0%
express some
 
01:29:12.530 --> 01:29:12.540 align:start position:0%
concerning terms that that sends up a
 
01:29:13.790 --> 01:29:13.800 align:start position:0%
flag for me
 
01:29:16.250 --> 01:29:16.260 align:start position:0%
um I and I feel like this putting this
 
01:29:18.110 --> 01:29:18.120 align:start position:0%
phrase in here Comprehensive Health
 
01:29:22.070 --> 01:29:22.080 align:start position:0%
education opens a door to Association
 
01:29:23.470 --> 01:29:23.480 align:start position:0%
like this
 
01:29:25.790 --> 01:29:25.800 align:start position:0%
bringing that ideology into the schools
 
01:29:27.470 --> 01:29:27.480 align:start position:0%
I've seen it in the libraries with the
 
01:29:28.970 --> 01:29:28.980 align:start position:0%
American Library Association with their
 
01:29:30.410 --> 01:29:30.420 align:start position:0%
Marxist ideology
 
01:29:32.810 --> 01:29:32.820 align:start position:0%
so that's what concerns me
 
01:29:32.820 --> 01:29:36.649 align:start position:0%
so that's what concerns me
um

01:29:36.649 --> 01:29:36.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:40.010 --> 01:29:40.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:43.250 --> 01:29:43.260 align:start position:0%
just follow up just a quick one I mean
 
01:29:45.050 --> 01:29:45.060 align:start position:0%
you had some examples here from Texas
 
01:29:47.390 --> 01:29:47.400 align:start position:0%
and Florida but I would suggest people
 
01:29:50.990 --> 01:29:51.000 align:start position:0%
look at Massachusetts and their statute
 
01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:51.790 align:start position:0%
look at Massachusetts and their statute
um

01:29:51.790 --> 01:29:51.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:29:54.590 --> 01:29:54.600 align:start position:0%
requires all schools to have they call
 
01:29:56.870 --> 01:29:56.880 align:start position:0%
it a safe and supportive environment and
 
01:29:59.390 --> 01:29:59.400 align:start position:0%
then there are specific guidelines that
 
01:30:01.550 --> 01:30:01.560 align:start position:0%
all schools must follow
 
01:30:05.149 --> 01:30:05.159 align:start position:0%
to be able to help students who have
 
01:30:07.370 --> 01:30:07.380 align:start position:0%
mental health disorders who have been
 
01:30:10.490 --> 01:30:10.500 align:start position:0%
traumatized there's a lot of research on
 
01:30:14.030 --> 01:30:14.040 align:start position:0%
trauma sensitive schools using the aces
 
01:30:17.470 --> 01:30:17.480 align:start position:0%
to be able to identify and support kids
 
01:30:20.629 --> 01:30:20.639 align:start position:0%
so just another resource that I think
 
01:30:23.030 --> 01:30:23.040 align:start position:0%
would be strongly but isn't that in
 
01:30:25.250 --> 01:30:25.260 align:start position:0%
conjunction with mtss which is the
 
01:30:27.709 --> 01:30:27.719 align:start position:0%
multi-tiered system where it may not be
 
01:30:30.110 --> 01:30:30.120 align:start position:0%
part of tier one but you you get into
 
01:30:31.850 --> 01:30:31.860 align:start position:0%
those other levels where you're dealing
 
01:30:34.129 --> 01:30:34.139 align:start position:0%
now with the professionals not the
 
01:30:36.590 --> 01:30:36.600 align:start position:0%
schools we're not asking a teacher to be
 
01:30:39.649 --> 01:30:39.659 align:start position:0%
a professional and I think that's when I
 
01:30:41.270 --> 01:30:41.280 align:start position:0%
initially heard that I said well all of
 
01:30:42.290 --> 01:30:42.300 align:start position:0%
a sudden we're going to make you know
 
01:30:45.709 --> 01:30:45.719 align:start position:0%
our our our teachers psychiatrists the
 
01:30:48.410 --> 01:30:48.420 align:start position:0%
MD type level or even a psychologist or
 
01:30:50.570 --> 01:30:50.580 align:start position:0%
our counselor and that's you know that
 
01:30:52.729 --> 01:30:52.739 align:start position:0%
that's not their job
 
01:30:52.739 --> 01:30:53.570 align:start position:0%
that's not their job
um

01:30:53.570 --> 01:30:53.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:30:57.229 --> 01:30:57.239 align:start position:0%
so I I I I feel that part of this is
 
01:31:00.649 --> 01:31:00.659 align:start position:0%
also on training of our our teachers to
 
01:31:02.750 --> 01:31:02.760 align:start position:0%
know how to deal with issues and that's
 
01:31:05.570 --> 01:31:05.580 align:start position:0%
why I put forth the issue dealing with
 
01:31:08.149 --> 01:31:08.159 align:start position:0%
the the the information that came out of
 
01:31:11.330 --> 01:31:11.340 align:start position:0%
uh Florida and on page
 
01:31:14.270 --> 01:31:14.280 align:start position:0%
uh at the back of that whole Litany of
 
01:31:16.129 --> 01:31:16.139 align:start position:0%
stuff there
 
01:31:19.729 --> 01:31:19.739 align:start position:0%
um on pages 10 and 11 there's underlined
 
01:31:22.490 --> 01:31:22.500 align:start position:0%
there and one of the without not going
 
01:31:23.990 --> 01:31:24.000 align:start position:0%
through and reading it all it talks
 
01:31:26.450 --> 01:31:26.460 align:start position:0%
about expanding school-based mental
 
01:31:28.610 --> 01:31:28.620 align:start position:0%
health care training Educators and other
 
01:31:30.830 --> 01:31:30.840 align:start position:0%
staff and detecting responding to mental
 
01:31:32.209 --> 01:31:32.219 align:start position:0%
health issues and connecting children
 
01:31:34.129 --> 01:31:34.139 align:start position:0%
youth families who may experience
 
01:31:36.050 --> 01:31:36.060 align:start position:0%
behavioral health issues with
 
01:31:38.770 --> 01:31:38.780 align:start position:0%
appropriate services
 
01:31:41.149 --> 01:31:41.159 align:start position:0%
so the school is not going to be
 
01:31:43.370 --> 01:31:43.380 align:start position:0%
necessarily that service it's you know
 
01:31:45.050 --> 01:31:45.060 align:start position:0%
like when I was a principal I had
 
01:31:47.209 --> 01:31:47.219 align:start position:0%
Community Mental Health housed in my
 
01:31:48.709 --> 01:31:48.719 align:start position:0%
building right
 
01:31:52.129 --> 01:31:52.139 align:start position:0%
and we work jointly together and it
 
01:31:53.810 --> 01:31:53.820 align:start position:0%
worked miracles
 
01:31:55.910 --> 01:31:55.920 align:start position:0%
right there's nothing that prevents a
 
01:31:58.010 --> 01:31:58.020 align:start position:0%
provider from coming on site represent
 
01:32:01.669 --> 01:32:01.679 align:start position:0%
cordelli thank you I'd like to go back a
 
01:32:02.930 --> 01:32:02.940 align:start position:0%
little bit
 
01:32:04.610 --> 01:32:04.620 align:start position:0%
um we're talking about the Frameworks
 
01:32:06.830 --> 01:32:06.840 align:start position:0%
and then just point out that mental
 
01:32:08.810 --> 01:32:08.820 align:start position:0%
health as was mentioned is included in
 
01:32:10.970 --> 01:32:10.980 align:start position:0%
here but also broken down by elementary
 
01:32:13.910 --> 01:32:13.920 align:start position:0%
middle and high school sections which I
 
01:32:16.790 --> 01:32:16.800 align:start position:0%
think is important and I was not here
 
01:32:18.890 --> 01:32:18.900 align:start position:0%
for the last
 
01:32:18.900 --> 01:32:19.669 align:start position:0%
for the last
um

01:32:19.669 --> 01:32:19.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:32:23.629 --> 01:32:23.639 align:start position:0%
session of this on these bills but I
 
01:32:27.530 --> 01:32:27.540 align:start position:0%
watch much of the video and one thing
 
01:32:30.410 --> 01:32:30.420 align:start position:0%
that struck me someone mentioned
 
01:32:34.430 --> 01:32:34.440 align:start position:0%
um are we contributing to the problem
 
01:32:37.430 --> 01:32:37.440 align:start position:0%
um and I think that can't be dismissed
 
01:32:39.470 --> 01:32:39.480 align:start position:0%
either you know I've got articles here
 
01:32:41.510 --> 01:32:41.520 align:start position:0%
does high school cause team team
 
01:32:46.250 --> 01:32:46.260 align:start position:0%
depression can school cause depression
 
01:32:46.260 --> 01:32:47.270 align:start position:0%
depression can school cause depression
um

01:32:47.270 --> 01:32:47.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:32:50.290 --> 01:32:50.300 align:start position:0%
can school cause mental illness
 
01:32:53.649 --> 01:32:53.659 align:start position:0%
talking about colleges and
 
01:32:55.990 --> 01:32:56.000 align:start position:0%
safe spaces
 
01:32:59.629 --> 01:32:59.639 align:start position:0%
there's a book coming out dealing with
 
01:33:02.450 --> 01:33:02.460 align:start position:0%
social media and smartphones and taking
 
01:33:07.189 --> 01:33:07.199 align:start position:0%
phones away from uh kids but also you
 
01:33:09.910 --> 01:33:09.920 align:start position:0%
know we've talked about before
 
01:33:14.629 --> 01:33:14.639 align:start position:0%
the drugs that kids are put on for hdhd
 
01:33:17.450 --> 01:33:17.460 align:start position:0%
ETC and here's a warning article about
 
01:33:21.050 --> 01:33:21.060 align:start position:0%
the shortage of those medications and
 
01:33:22.910 --> 01:33:22.920 align:start position:0%
what what impact is that going to have
 
01:33:26.470 --> 01:33:26.480 align:start position:0%
on mental health so I I think that
 
01:33:29.390 --> 01:33:29.400 align:start position:0%
besides you know addressing you know
 
01:33:31.550 --> 01:33:31.560 align:start position:0%
mental health in the curriculum I think
 
01:33:34.790 --> 01:33:34.800 align:start position:0%
the system has to take a look inwards as
 
01:33:34.800 --> 01:33:36.950 align:start position:0%
the system has to take a look inwards as
well

01:33:36.950 --> 01:33:36.960 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:33:39.410 --> 01:33:39.420 align:start position:0%
further discussion represent Belcher
 
01:33:41.149 --> 01:33:41.159 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and I'd like to I'd
 
01:33:42.470 --> 01:33:42.480 align:start position:0%
like to heavily agree with what rep
 
01:33:44.870 --> 01:33:44.880 align:start position:0%
cordelli just said and I think we
 
01:33:46.550 --> 01:33:46.560 align:start position:0%
actually need to rewind this all the way
 
01:33:48.350 --> 01:33:48.360 align:start position:0%
to the beginning not not just to this
 
01:33:51.110 --> 01:33:51.120 align:start position:0%
bill but even to this 2003 outline and
 
01:33:52.790 --> 01:33:52.800 align:start position:0%
we have to ask ourselves also a
 
01:33:55.250 --> 01:33:55.260 align:start position:0%
fundamental question because the premise
 
01:33:59.090 --> 01:33:59.100 align:start position:0%
is seemingly assumed that public schools
 
01:34:03.290 --> 01:34:03.300 align:start position:0%
can and should be doing something to
 
01:34:05.330 --> 01:34:05.340 align:start position:0%
solve this problem
 
01:34:07.370 --> 01:34:07.380 align:start position:0%
and I think we need to actually tease
 
01:34:09.770 --> 01:34:09.780 align:start position:0%
out that argument is that something that
 
01:34:11.629 --> 01:34:11.639 align:start position:0%
needs to be done at public schools and I
 
01:34:14.649 --> 01:34:14.659 align:start position:0%
to offer just one anecdote toward that
 
01:34:17.930 --> 01:34:17.940 align:start position:0%
we heard moving testimony from a young
 
01:34:20.750 --> 01:34:20.760 align:start position:0%
lady last session right here
 
01:34:23.570 --> 01:34:23.580 align:start position:0%
who testified not specifically to mental
 
01:34:26.870 --> 01:34:26.880 align:start position:0%
health she was testifying on Civics but
 
01:34:29.689 --> 01:34:29.699 align:start position:0%
she testified to her mental health
 
01:34:29.699 --> 01:34:31.610 align:start position:0%
she testified to her mental health
difficulties

01:34:31.610 --> 01:34:31.620 align:start position:0%
difficulties
 
01:34:34.910 --> 01:34:34.920 align:start position:0%
that were breaking her down as a student
 
01:34:37.430 --> 01:34:37.440 align:start position:0%
she nearly cried in testimony
 
01:34:39.470 --> 01:34:39.480 align:start position:0%
and the reason that she was doing that
 
01:34:42.470 --> 01:34:42.480 align:start position:0%
and because she made this very explicit
 
01:34:46.430 --> 01:34:46.440 align:start position:0%
was that the problems of the world from
 
01:34:49.550 --> 01:34:49.560 align:start position:0%
climate change to racism were on her
 
01:34:52.550 --> 01:34:52.560 align:start position:0%
shoulders and she learned this in public
 
01:34:52.560 --> 01:34:53.570 align:start position:0%
shoulders and she learned this in public
school

01:34:53.570 --> 01:34:53.580 align:start position:0%
school
 
01:34:55.550 --> 01:34:55.560 align:start position:0%
so we need to think a real hard look
 
01:34:57.709 --> 01:34:57.719 align:start position:0%
Inward and see are we put in the
 
01:35:00.050 --> 01:35:00.060 align:start position:0%
problems of the world on teenagers and
 
01:35:01.610 --> 01:35:01.620 align:start position:0%
asking them to solve these problems
 
01:35:03.410 --> 01:35:03.420 align:start position:0%
because that isn't something that should
 
01:35:06.770 --> 01:35:06.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:08.870 --> 01:35:08.880 align:start position:0%
representative Cascade that's why
 
01:35:14.870 --> 01:35:14.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:18.530 --> 01:35:18.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:22.070 --> 01:35:22.080 align:start position:0%
I just want to observe that
 
01:35:22.080 --> 01:35:23.510 align:start position:0%
I just want to observe that
wow

01:35:23.510 --> 01:35:23.520 align:start position:0%
wow
 
01:35:27.350 --> 01:35:27.360 align:start position:0%
mental health education is in
 
01:35:30.410 --> 01:35:30.420 align:start position:0%
the 189 10 and helpful to have that hand
 
01:35:33.229 --> 01:35:33.239 align:start position:0%
out in front of us thank you
 
01:35:37.129 --> 01:35:37.139 align:start position:0%
quite frankly I am not confident that in
 
01:35:40.070 --> 01:35:40.080 align:start position:0%
our present process in education in New
 
01:35:42.590 --> 01:35:42.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire through Doe
 
01:35:45.110 --> 01:35:45.120 align:start position:0%
that if mental health is not included in
 
01:35:49.189 --> 01:35:49.199 align:start position:0%
the RSA as a topic of Education
 
01:35:53.209 --> 01:35:53.219 align:start position:0%
that it will stay in the 306 rules and
 
01:35:55.850 --> 01:35:55.860 align:start position:0%
therefore I vigorously support that it
 
01:35:58.490 --> 01:35:58.500 align:start position:0%
be included as a law that we provide
 
01:36:01.070 --> 01:36:01.080 align:start position:0%
mental health education that's one of
 
01:36:05.510 --> 01:36:05.520 align:start position:0%
the reasons why we have the ed306 rules
 
01:36:07.149 --> 01:36:07.159 align:start position:0%
the Draft rules
 
01:36:10.610 --> 01:36:10.620 align:start position:0%
a session for us to look at and discuss
 
01:36:12.169 --> 01:36:12.179 align:start position:0%
here because that is one of the
 
01:36:15.470 --> 01:36:15.480 align:start position:0%
components which is stripped from the
 
01:36:18.250 --> 01:36:18.260 align:start position:0%
proposed rules
 
01:36:22.010 --> 01:36:22.020 align:start position:0%
306.40 is those elements of Mental
 
01:36:24.530 --> 01:36:24.540 align:start position:0%
Health Nutrition and all that that come
 
01:36:27.590 --> 01:36:27.600 align:start position:0%
underneath are gone
 
01:36:30.649 --> 01:36:30.659 align:start position:0%
that's the same thing in in social
 
01:36:32.590 --> 01:36:32.600 align:start position:0%
studies and Science and all that the the
 
01:36:35.270 --> 01:36:35.280 align:start position:0%
elements within those topical subject
 
01:36:37.250 --> 01:36:37.260 align:start position:0%
areas are gone
 
01:36:40.370 --> 01:36:40.380 align:start position:0%
well so they're gone from rule then
 
01:36:42.530 --> 01:36:42.540 align:start position:0%
where is there any reference to that in
 
01:36:44.510 --> 01:36:44.520 align:start position:0%
statute well we have in Statue already
 
01:36:46.790 --> 01:36:46.800 align:start position:0%
where a reference is health and
 
01:36:48.530 --> 01:36:48.540 align:start position:0%
interpersonal relationships Health
 
01:36:51.590 --> 01:36:51.600 align:start position:0%
meaning well what is health then we go
 
01:36:53.629 --> 01:36:53.639 align:start position:0%
to 306 and we gave rulemaking authority
 
01:36:55.370 --> 01:36:55.380 align:start position:0%
to the state board and they defined what
 
01:36:58.070 --> 01:36:58.080 align:start position:0%
else was they've approved that in their
 
01:37:00.530 --> 01:37:00.540 align:start position:0%
framework and their academic standards
 
01:37:03.590 --> 01:37:03.600 align:start position:0%
and so somewhere along the way I I think
 
01:37:05.510 --> 01:37:05.520 align:start position:0%
we need to have health education
 
01:37:09.350 --> 01:37:09.360 align:start position:0%
specified in statute if not in mental
 
01:37:11.209 --> 01:37:11.219 align:start position:0%
health which is a component within
 
01:37:11.219 --> 01:37:12.050 align:start position:0%
health which is a component within
health

01:37:12.050 --> 01:37:12.060 align:start position:0%
health
 
01:37:14.770 --> 01:37:14.780 align:start position:0%
uh I have no problem with that either
 
01:37:17.390 --> 01:37:17.400 align:start position:0%
but we have a lot of areas within health
 
01:37:19.250 --> 01:37:19.260 align:start position:0%
education and we've addressed some of
 
01:37:21.229 --> 01:37:21.239 align:start position:0%
the substance abuse that's in under
 
01:37:23.270 --> 01:37:23.280 align:start position:0%
these studies right now the difference
 
01:37:24.649 --> 01:37:24.659 align:start position:0%
between this field and the next bill
 
01:37:27.229 --> 01:37:27.239 align:start position:0%
which we discuss is that one of them's
 
01:37:28.669 --> 01:37:28.679 align:start position:0%
looking at putting language in the
 
01:37:32.470 --> 01:37:32.480 align:start position:0%
studies 189 the other is looking at 193
 
01:37:34.910 --> 01:37:34.920 align:start position:0%
adequate education
 
01:37:39.169 --> 01:37:39.179 align:start position:0%
where health education already is in law
 
01:37:42.350 --> 01:37:42.360 align:start position:0%
so I I guess that that's what we got to
 
01:37:45.229 --> 01:37:45.239 align:start position:0%
really be focused on now is in in the
 
01:37:47.629 --> 01:37:47.639 align:start position:0%
word comprehensive is comprehensive out
 
01:37:49.729 --> 01:37:49.739 align:start position:0%
is that all out right there do we need
 
01:37:52.430 --> 01:37:52.440 align:start position:0%
it that's that's the question I would I
 
01:37:55.669 --> 01:37:55.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:59.510 --> 01:37:59.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:03.669 --> 01:38:03.679 align:start position:0%
no represent cascad I agree the adequate
 
01:38:06.590 --> 01:38:06.600 align:start position:0%
education standards includes Health yes
 
01:38:10.669 --> 01:38:10.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:12.229 --> 01:38:12.239 align:start position:0%
and then it makes a reference to the
 
01:38:14.450 --> 01:38:14.460 align:start position:0%
substance abuse stuff as an RSA
 
01:38:21.770 --> 01:38:21.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:24.470 --> 01:38:24.480 align:start position:0%
but then if we take it out of 306 see
 
01:38:30.290 --> 01:38:30.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:32.870 --> 01:38:32.880 align:start position:0%
I I think that you're correct I think it
 
01:38:37.370 --> 01:38:37.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:37.380 --> 01:38:39.530 align:start position:0%
 
representative

01:38:39.530 --> 01:38:39.540 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:38:41.930 --> 01:38:41.940 align:start position:0%
I've been puzzled by this all along
 
01:38:41.940 --> 01:38:45.350 align:start position:0%
I've been puzzled by this all along
because

01:38:45.350 --> 01:38:45.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:48.709 --> 01:38:48.719 align:start position:0%
trying to parse this it talks about all
 
01:38:50.930 --> 01:38:50.940 align:start position:0%
these things that need to be taught to
 
01:38:54.530 --> 01:38:54.540 align:start position:0%
people's pupils and then it goes on as
 
01:38:57.410 --> 01:38:57.420 align:start position:0%
they relate to the effects of alcohol in
 
01:39:01.149 --> 01:39:01.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:04.490 --> 01:39:04.500 align:start position:0%
and are we only teaching those as they
 
01:39:07.070 --> 01:39:07.080 align:start position:0%
relate to those things or should we be
 
01:39:10.070 --> 01:39:10.080 align:start position:0%
teaching as well those the effects of
 
01:39:14.149 --> 01:39:14.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:16.189 --> 01:39:16.199 align:start position:0%
I don't know maybe it's me but the way
 
01:39:18.350 --> 01:39:18.360 align:start position:0%
I'm reading it it seems because it says
 
01:39:20.870 --> 01:39:20.880 align:start position:0%
as they relate to
 
01:39:24.770 --> 01:39:24.780 align:start position:0%
means the things before that are taught
 
01:39:27.229 --> 01:39:27.239 align:start position:0%
as they relate to the things after that
 
01:39:30.169 --> 01:39:30.179 align:start position:0%
and I don't think was that what was
 
01:39:33.070 --> 01:39:33.080 align:start position:0%
intended I mean
 
01:39:35.689 --> 01:39:35.699 align:start position:0%
Jen did for us
 
01:39:38.090 --> 01:39:38.100 align:start position:0%
you're going to see one of the areas
 
01:39:40.310 --> 01:39:40.320 align:start position:0%
health education as it relates to the
 
01:39:42.950 --> 01:39:42.960 align:start position:0%
effects of alcohol and drugs right we
 
01:39:45.709 --> 01:39:45.719 align:start position:0%
have 233 schools responding yes we do it
 
01:39:48.410 --> 01:39:48.420 align:start position:0%
and we have 14 Schools saying no we
 
01:39:51.790 --> 01:39:51.800 align:start position:0%
don't so my question is was this put in
 
01:39:55.610 --> 01:39:55.620 align:start position:0%
to say that these things need to be that
 
01:39:57.830 --> 01:39:57.840 align:start position:0%
the focus was
 
01:40:01.550 --> 01:40:01.560 align:start position:0%
alcohol and drugs sexual violence that
 
01:40:03.649 --> 01:40:03.659 align:start position:0%
you know the the the things that it's
 
01:40:05.649 --> 01:40:05.659 align:start position:0%
talking as they relate to
 
01:40:11.629 --> 01:40:11.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:14.629 --> 01:40:14.639 align:start position:0%
um the things being taught physiology
 
01:40:19.610 --> 01:40:19.620 align:start position:0%
hygiene Etc is is someplace else
 
01:40:22.550 --> 01:40:22.560 align:start position:0%
and this bill was just saying that we
 
01:40:24.950 --> 01:40:24.960 align:start position:0%
also have to be in use use those things
 
01:40:28.010 --> 01:40:28.020 align:start position:0%
to teach
 
01:40:30.910 --> 01:40:30.920 align:start position:0%
um the effects of alcohol and drugs Etc
 
01:40:34.790 --> 01:40:34.800 align:start position:0%
so why was this
 
01:40:37.910 --> 01:40:37.920 align:start position:0%
why was this originally put into law and
 
01:40:40.070 --> 01:40:40.080 align:start position:0%
what was the point because it seems to
 
01:40:41.930 --> 01:40:41.940 align:start position:0%
me in reading it the point was dealing
 
01:40:41.940 --> 01:40:42.830 align:start position:0%
me in reading it the point was dealing
with

01:40:42.830 --> 01:40:42.840 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:40:48.250 --> 01:40:48.260 align:start position:0%
alcohol drugs child abuse HIV Etc
 
01:40:51.470 --> 01:40:51.480 align:start position:0%
and it seems like those other things
 
01:40:54.410 --> 01:40:54.420 align:start position:0%
show up elsewhere as teaching them and
 
01:40:56.390 --> 01:40:56.400 align:start position:0%
are only mentioned here is the way as
 
01:40:58.610 --> 01:40:58.620 align:start position:0%
what we're using to point out these
 
01:41:01.610 --> 01:41:01.620 align:start position:0%
other things so it's a question I don't
 
01:41:04.970 --> 01:41:04.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:07.129 --> 01:41:07.139 align:start position:0%
representative and then represent
 
01:41:09.410 --> 01:41:09.420 align:start position:0%
cordial thank you I
 
01:41:12.050 --> 01:41:12.060 align:start position:0%
as we're looking at this I remember when
 
01:41:13.990 --> 01:41:14.000 align:start position:0%
we first when we had this first hearing
 
01:41:17.649 --> 01:41:17.659 align:start position:0%
and this whole section
 
01:41:21.649 --> 01:41:21.659 align:start position:0%
189 colon 10 Roman numeral two really
 
01:41:24.110 --> 01:41:24.120 align:start position:0%
needs an entire revision because it's
 
01:41:28.189 --> 01:41:28.199 align:start position:0%
like a Dumping Ground for the the latest
 
01:41:32.270 --> 01:41:32.280 align:start position:0%
health issue of the day and I think we
 
01:41:34.629 --> 01:41:34.639 align:start position:0%
could tighten that up so that it
 
01:41:37.250 --> 01:41:37.260 align:start position:0%
encompasses a lot more
 
01:41:39.590 --> 01:41:39.600 align:start position:0%
in broader language in one section
 
01:41:41.689 --> 01:41:41.699 align:start position:0%
rather than starting to delineate each
 
01:41:45.410 --> 01:41:45.420 align:start position:0%
and every single malady as it
 
01:41:47.689 --> 01:41:47.699 align:start position:0%
comes across the legislature
 
01:41:50.390 --> 01:41:50.400 align:start position:0%
that's a that's a cleanup that if you
 
01:41:50.400 --> 01:41:51.229 align:start position:0%
that's a that's a cleanup that if you
knew

01:41:51.229 --> 01:41:51.239 align:start position:0%
knew
 
01:41:54.709 --> 01:41:54.719 align:start position:0%
uh the folks that were in OLS prior when
 
01:41:57.770 --> 01:41:57.780 align:start position:0%
Anthony was there this is an echo you
 
01:41:59.930 --> 01:41:59.940 align:start position:0%
just echoed what Anthony was saying that
 
01:42:03.530 --> 01:42:03.540 align:start position:0%
we we either put a subject area in under
 
01:42:07.129 --> 01:42:07.139 align:start position:0%
adequacy or you dump it into studies
 
01:42:07.139 --> 01:42:09.790 align:start position:0%
adequacy or you dump it into studies
and

01:42:09.790 --> 01:42:09.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:42:13.010 --> 01:42:13.020 align:start position:0%
that that's you know that's uh something
 
01:42:14.209 --> 01:42:14.219 align:start position:0%
that has to be answered because we've
 
01:42:16.189 --> 01:42:16.199 align:start position:0%
sort of been dumping in both places
 
01:42:17.990 --> 01:42:18.000 align:start position:0%
and every time you enter any something
 
01:42:20.750 --> 01:42:20.760 align:start position:0%
into adequacy you're talking about the
 
01:42:23.450 --> 01:42:23.460 align:start position:0%
requirement for funding that as well
 
01:42:26.689 --> 01:42:26.699 align:start position:0%
so we'd dump it into studies and like
 
01:42:28.490 --> 01:42:28.500 align:start position:0%
personal finance literacy we did that
 
01:42:31.490 --> 01:42:31.500 align:start position:0%
and you mesh it either into your course
 
01:42:33.590 --> 01:42:33.600 align:start position:0%
of Economics you're teaching or into the
 
01:42:35.570 --> 01:42:35.580 align:start position:0%
classroom in the grade schools or are
 
01:42:37.910 --> 01:42:37.920 align:start position:0%
you teaching us a separate class
 
01:42:37.920 --> 01:42:38.990 align:start position:0%
you teaching us a separate class
so

01:42:38.990 --> 01:42:39.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:42:43.370 --> 01:42:43.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:45.470 --> 01:42:45.480 align:start position:0%
yes represent cordial well I think
 
01:42:47.149 --> 01:42:47.159 align:start position:0%
grammatically it's just a mess because
 
01:42:49.129 --> 01:42:49.139 align:start position:0%
now I see what you're saying it doesn't
 
01:42:50.990 --> 01:42:51.000 align:start position:0%
make any sense I don't know if it's a
 
01:42:53.450 --> 01:42:53.460 align:start position:0%
misplaced modifier or what but when you
 
01:42:55.370 --> 01:42:55.380 align:start position:0%
get to the end it does sound like all
 
01:42:57.770 --> 01:42:57.780 align:start position:0%
the whole list is only in its
 
01:42:59.390 --> 01:42:59.400 align:start position:0%
relationship the effects of alcohol and
 
01:43:00.530 --> 01:43:00.540 align:start position:0%
other drugs and I don't think that's
 
01:43:02.330 --> 01:43:02.340 align:start position:0%
what was intended but the way I could
 
01:43:04.250 --> 01:43:04.260 align:start position:0%
see where it's very confusing so it
 
01:43:05.689 --> 01:43:05.699 align:start position:0%
seems like one of the things I want that
 
01:43:07.189 --> 01:43:07.199 align:start position:0%
you need to address is alcohol and drugs
 
01:43:10.790 --> 01:43:10.800 align:start position:0%
but that's separate but so anyway yeah
 
01:43:14.090 --> 01:43:14.100 align:start position:0%
grammatically a mess too
 
01:43:14.100 --> 01:43:15.709 align:start position:0%
grammatically a mess too
yeah

01:43:15.709 --> 01:43:15.719 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:43:20.570 --> 01:43:20.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:20.580 --> 01:43:23.090 align:start position:0%
 
yes

01:43:23.090 --> 01:43:23.100 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:43:25.070 --> 01:43:25.080 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:43:28.070 --> 01:43:28.080 align:start position:0%
so I don't know if this is a appropriate
 
01:43:28.080 --> 01:43:30.530 align:start position:0%
so I don't know if this is a appropriate
uh

01:43:30.530 --> 01:43:30.540 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:43:30.540 --> 01:43:32.570 align:start position:0%
uh
request

01:43:32.570 --> 01:43:32.580 align:start position:0%
request
 
01:43:34.970 --> 01:43:34.980 align:start position:0%
but I would wonder if we could maybe do
 
01:43:37.430 --> 01:43:37.440 align:start position:0%
a strop hole of if the word
 
01:43:40.609 --> 01:43:40.619 align:start position:0%
comprehensive was removed
 
01:43:42.590 --> 01:43:42.600 align:start position:0%
but the words mental health education
 
01:43:42.600 --> 01:43:43.750 align:start position:0%
but the words mental health education
were

01:43:43.750 --> 01:43:43.760 align:start position:0%
were
 
01:43:46.189 --> 01:43:46.199 align:start position:0%
inserted so right now all the bill does
 
01:43:49.030 --> 01:43:49.040 align:start position:0%
was put those four words in
 
01:43:51.590 --> 01:43:51.600 align:start position:0%
serting inserting which number no
 
01:43:54.410 --> 01:43:54.420 align:start position:0%
removing the words comprehensive and
 
01:43:57.290 --> 01:43:57.300 align:start position:0%
leaving mental health education
 
01:43:59.629 --> 01:43:59.639 align:start position:0%
I'm just wondering if
 
01:44:01.729 --> 01:44:01.739 align:start position:0%
I could get some feedback on how people
 
01:44:03.169 --> 01:44:03.179 align:start position:0%
would perceive it
 
01:44:06.590 --> 01:44:06.600 align:start position:0%
in the absence of the word comprehensive
 
01:44:08.810 --> 01:44:08.820 align:start position:0%
okay tagging in on that and then
 
01:44:11.030 --> 01:44:11.040 align:start position:0%
representative Hall uh if you look at
 
01:44:13.430 --> 01:44:13.440 align:start position:0%
the 306 rules right now
 
01:44:16.490 --> 01:44:16.500 align:start position:0%
and it'd be the on the
 
01:44:19.490 --> 01:44:19.500 align:start position:0%
at the section two which I'm looking at
 
01:44:22.609 --> 01:44:22.619 align:start position:0%
it identifies a plan K through 12
 
01:44:24.590 --> 01:44:24.600 align:start position:0%
curriculum and health education designed
 
01:44:27.470 --> 01:44:27.480 align:start position:0%
to teach the skills listed in the above
 
01:44:29.629 --> 01:44:29.639 align:start position:0%
across the following content areas of
 
01:44:31.390 --> 01:44:31.400 align:start position:0%
health education
 
01:44:35.510 --> 01:44:35.520 align:start position:0%
a through I are we supposed to now
 
01:44:39.470 --> 01:44:39.480 align:start position:0%
remember this is this is rules so we we
 
01:44:39.480 --> 01:44:40.490 align:start position:0%
remember this is this is rules so we we
tell

01:44:40.490 --> 01:44:40.500 align:start position:0%
tell
 
01:44:42.590 --> 01:44:42.600 align:start position:0%
the the rules what should rule should be
 
01:44:44.689 --> 01:44:44.699 align:start position:0%
but if if we were to put everything
 
01:44:47.810 --> 01:44:47.820 align:start position:0%
that's in rule into statute it'd be a
 
01:44:49.550 --> 01:44:49.560 align:start position:0%
whole lot more than just you know it
 
01:44:52.430 --> 01:44:52.440 align:start position:0%
would be alcohol and drug use prevention
 
01:44:54.470 --> 01:44:54.480 align:start position:0%
injury prevention nutrition physical
 
01:44:56.450 --> 01:44:56.460 align:start position:0%
activity family life and comprehensive
 
01:44:59.090 --> 01:44:59.100 align:start position:0%
sexuality education tobacco use
 
01:45:00.350 --> 01:45:00.360 align:start position:0%
prevention mental health personal
 
01:45:02.270 --> 01:45:02.280 align:start position:0%
consumer health community and
 
01:45:03.950 --> 01:45:03.960 align:start position:0%
environmental health
 
01:45:08.209 --> 01:45:08.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:10.010 --> 01:45:10.020 align:start position:0%
well I'm asking anybody here you know
 
01:45:11.570 --> 01:45:11.580 align:start position:0%
it's it goes back to what represents
 
01:45:13.550 --> 01:45:13.560 align:start position:0%
better now was just saying you know do
 
01:45:15.290 --> 01:45:15.300 align:start position:0%
we dump it there or we just go with the
 
01:45:18.890 --> 01:45:18.900 align:start position:0%
definition of health education and and
 
01:45:20.689 --> 01:45:20.699 align:start position:0%
give rulemaking authority to the
 
01:45:22.609 --> 01:45:22.619 align:start position:0%
department State Board of Education to
 
01:45:25.790 --> 01:45:25.800 align:start position:0%
define those Elements which are within
 
01:45:28.010 --> 01:45:28.020 align:start position:0%
what are the academic standards for
 
01:45:30.470 --> 01:45:30.480 align:start position:0%
those that are and it's also within
 
01:45:32.149 --> 01:45:32.159 align:start position:0%
minimum schools standards for public
 
01:45:35.270 --> 01:45:35.280 align:start position:0%
school approval which are these rules
 
01:45:37.310 --> 01:45:37.320 align:start position:0%
represent dry
 
01:45:39.109 --> 01:45:39.119 align:start position:0%
thank you following up on that I just
 
01:45:41.450 --> 01:45:41.460 align:start position:0%
like page 10 in there kind of this is
 
01:45:44.270 --> 01:45:44.280 align:start position:0%
the national standards right age 10 is
 
01:45:47.390 --> 01:45:47.400 align:start position:0%
the health education curriculum and
 
01:45:50.169 --> 01:45:50.179 align:start position:0%
that's this is what I think the national
 
01:45:52.609 --> 01:45:52.619 align:start position:0%
education standards are thinking when
 
01:45:55.430 --> 01:45:55.440 align:start position:0%
they think about health and I think that
 
01:45:57.530 --> 01:45:57.540 align:start position:0%
everything you talked about is in here
 
01:46:00.350 --> 01:46:00.360 align:start position:0%
but not necessarily has to be in statute
 
01:46:02.270 --> 01:46:02.280 align:start position:0%
and see those what you're looking at
 
01:46:05.390 --> 01:46:05.400 align:start position:0%
were the old Frameworks
 
01:46:08.149 --> 01:46:08.159 align:start position:0%
which gave guidance to how to teach
 
01:46:10.250 --> 01:46:10.260 align:start position:0%
though towards those academic standards
 
01:46:12.410 --> 01:46:12.420 align:start position:0%
for all these subject areas that's the
 
01:46:14.030 --> 01:46:14.040 align:start position:0%
way we did it
 
01:46:15.830 --> 01:46:15.840 align:start position:0%
and but we don't have Frameworks anymore
 
01:46:23.689 --> 01:46:23.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:26.689 --> 01:46:26.699 align:start position:0%
yes representative excuse me I'm sorry
 
01:46:28.970 --> 01:46:28.980 align:start position:0%
uh I would like to answer representative
 
01:46:31.070 --> 01:46:31.080 align:start position:0%
Damon's question actually I think
 
01:46:34.310 --> 01:46:34.320 align:start position:0%
comprehensive is the intent of the bill
 
01:46:37.129 --> 01:46:37.139 align:start position:0%
I think if you take out comprehensive go
 
01:46:40.250 --> 01:46:40.260 align:start position:0%
back to what we have so I I remember the
 
01:46:42.649 --> 01:46:42.659 align:start position:0%
testimony it was all about this you know
 
01:46:44.570 --> 01:46:44.580 align:start position:0%
calling it comprehensive this all
 
01:46:46.250 --> 01:46:46.260 align:start position:0%
encompassing all the new stuff out there
 
01:46:49.250 --> 01:46:49.260 align:start position:0%
and whatnot just
 
01:46:50.990 --> 01:46:51.000 align:start position:0%
okay you're welcome
 
01:46:53.450 --> 01:46:53.460 align:start position:0%
and do we go and write a definition for
 
01:46:55.850 --> 01:46:55.860 align:start position:0%
comprehensive mental health would we
 
01:46:57.830 --> 01:46:57.840 align:start position:0%
borrow for example from that Texas
 
01:46:59.990 --> 01:47:00.000 align:start position:0%
definition which then later on gets into
 
01:47:05.870 --> 01:47:05.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:05.880 --> 01:47:08.390 align:start position:0%
 
yes

01:47:08.390 --> 01:47:08.400 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:47:13.430 --> 01:47:13.440 align:start position:0%
so the Texas information you provided is
 
01:47:15.970 --> 01:47:15.980 align:start position:0%
more than education
 
01:47:18.770 --> 01:47:18.780 align:start position:0%
its systems
 
01:47:21.350 --> 01:47:21.360 align:start position:0%
so those five bullet points at the top
 
01:47:23.990 --> 01:47:24.000 align:start position:0%
of the second page
 
01:47:27.109 --> 01:47:27.119 align:start position:0%
um not all of that is education
 
01:47:29.510 --> 01:47:29.520 align:start position:0%
so that's more than what I perceive this
 
01:47:32.750 --> 01:47:32.760 align:start position:0%
bill proposing to I agree I agree but
 
01:47:34.370 --> 01:47:34.380 align:start position:0%
that's part of something that schools do
 
01:47:36.649 --> 01:47:36.659 align:start position:0%
they do provide assistance and direction
 
01:47:38.810 --> 01:47:38.820 align:start position:0%
I'm not saying they shouldn't do that
 
01:47:41.030 --> 01:47:41.040 align:start position:0%
I'm just differentiating it from what I
 
01:47:46.910 --> 01:47:46.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:48.709 --> 01:47:48.719 align:start position:0%
and it goes on it says comprehensive
 
01:47:50.450 --> 01:47:50.460 align:start position:0%
School Mental Health Systems Support the
 
01:47:52.669 --> 01:47:52.679 align:start position:0%
safety academic success and well-being
 
01:47:57.290 --> 01:47:57.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:59.930 --> 01:47:59.940 align:start position:0%
foreign do we need all that language in
 
01:48:05.990 --> 01:48:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:08.990 align:start position:0%
 
right

01:48:08.990 --> 01:48:09.000 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:48:11.090 --> 01:48:11.100 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
01:48:12.890 --> 01:48:12.900 align:start position:0%
I think
 
01:48:15.109 --> 01:48:15.119 align:start position:0%
if we just leave all this up to
 
01:48:17.030 --> 01:48:17.040 align:start position:0%
rulemaking and we don't give some
 
01:48:17.040 --> 01:48:19.370 align:start position:0%
rulemaking and we don't give some
Direction

01:48:19.370 --> 01:48:19.380 align:start position:0%
Direction
 
01:48:22.970 --> 01:48:22.980 align:start position:0%
we we basically left It Wide Open if we
 
01:48:25.070 --> 01:48:25.080 align:start position:0%
just say mental health you decide what
 
01:48:27.470 --> 01:48:27.480 align:start position:0%
it is we're not giving any direction and
 
01:48:29.510 --> 01:48:29.520 align:start position:0%
it could be anything depending upon
 
01:48:31.729 --> 01:48:31.739 align:start position:0%
who's writing the rules that any
 
01:48:33.530 --> 01:48:33.540 align:start position:0%
particular time
 
01:48:35.689 --> 01:48:35.699 align:start position:0%
and I kind of don't see that as
 
01:48:38.810 --> 01:48:38.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:41.030 --> 01:48:41.040 align:start position:0%
but if you get specific remember we
 
01:48:43.310 --> 01:48:43.320 align:start position:0%
don't write curriculum we don't control
 
01:48:46.310 --> 01:48:46.320 align:start position:0%
instruction that is a local Education
 
01:48:46.320 --> 01:48:48.410 align:start position:0%
instruction that is a local Education
Agency

01:48:48.410 --> 01:48:48.420 align:start position:0%
Agency
 
01:48:52.070 --> 01:48:52.080 align:start position:0%
responsibility but is curriculum
 
01:48:54.950 --> 01:48:54.960 align:start position:0%
what is exactly curriculum because I've
 
01:48:57.830 --> 01:48:57.840 align:start position:0%
been reading all of 306.
 
01:48:59.930 --> 01:48:59.940 align:start position:0%
and it seems like there's an awful lot
 
01:49:01.669 --> 01:49:01.679 align:start position:0%
of stuff it seems like there's a big
 
01:49:03.590 --> 01:49:03.600 align:start position:0%
disagreement here between what
 
01:49:07.430 --> 01:49:07.440 align:start position:0%
curriculum is because 306 tells all
 
01:49:09.470 --> 01:49:09.480 align:start position:0%
kinds of things goes into all kinds of
 
01:49:09.480 --> 01:49:10.910 align:start position:0%
kinds of things goes into all kinds of
details

01:49:10.910 --> 01:49:10.920 align:start position:0%
details
 
01:49:13.070 --> 01:49:13.080 align:start position:0%
that we always say oh we shouldn't be
 
01:49:15.290 --> 01:49:15.300 align:start position:0%
doing because that's curriculum but 306
 
01:49:17.689 --> 01:49:17.699 align:start position:0%
isn't local either it's the state
 
01:49:21.770 --> 01:49:21.780 align:start position:0%
telling the towns what to do so where is
 
01:49:24.050 --> 01:49:24.060 align:start position:0%
that line between what the state should
 
01:49:25.910 --> 01:49:25.920 align:start position:0%
be telling them and what they should be
 
01:49:27.729 --> 01:49:27.739 align:start position:0%
deciding because yeah
 
01:49:30.590 --> 01:49:30.600 align:start position:0%
lots of details the state has given
 
01:49:32.270 --> 01:49:32.280 align:start position:0%
guidance through the curriculum
 
01:49:32.280 --> 01:49:34.070 align:start position:0%
guidance through the curriculum
Frameworks

01:49:34.070 --> 01:49:34.080 align:start position:0%
Frameworks
 
01:49:38.570 --> 01:49:38.580 align:start position:0%
which incorporate the academic standards
 
01:49:40.790 --> 01:49:40.800 align:start position:0%
now we may say some things in the
 
01:49:43.790 --> 01:49:43.800 align:start position:0%
academic a curriculum Frameworks that
 
01:49:44.870 --> 01:49:44.880 align:start position:0%
you're going to teach about Thomas
 
01:49:46.850 --> 01:49:46.860 align:start position:0%
Jefferson every school may not teach
 
01:49:48.649 --> 01:49:48.659 align:start position:0%
about Thomas Jefferson but they're going
 
01:49:50.930 --> 01:49:50.940 align:start position:0%
to teach that academic standards through
 
01:49:52.669 --> 01:49:52.679 align:start position:0%
maybe some different approach of doing
 
01:49:55.609 --> 01:49:55.619 align:start position:0%
that so I just took an off the wall type
 
01:49:58.250 --> 01:49:58.260 align:start position:0%
you know so
 
01:50:02.330 --> 01:50:02.340 align:start position:0%
I I and I I think we made a mistake as a
 
01:50:03.830 --> 01:50:03.840 align:start position:0%
legislator and I was the one that's
 
01:50:05.570 --> 01:50:05.580 align:start position:0%
probably pushing this because the
 
01:50:08.209 --> 01:50:08.219 align:start position:0%
Statewide assessment wasn't measuring a
 
01:50:10.250 --> 01:50:10.260 align:start position:0%
lot of this stuff we took curriculum
 
01:50:13.070 --> 01:50:13.080 align:start position:0%
Frameworks out of law
 
01:50:15.470 --> 01:50:15.480 align:start position:0%
and I've introduced legislation again
 
01:50:17.930 --> 01:50:17.940 align:start position:0%
putting it back in this go around
 
01:50:20.209 --> 01:50:20.219 align:start position:0%
and putting curriculum Frameworks back
 
01:50:22.070 --> 01:50:22.080 align:start position:0%
in as a guidance and you know we're not
 
01:50:23.090 --> 01:50:23.100 align:start position:0%
telling what their curriculum
 
01:50:24.890 --> 01:50:24.900 align:start position:0%
instructions going to be but we're
 
01:50:26.570 --> 01:50:26.580 align:start position:0%
giving guidance this is how we
 
01:50:29.090 --> 01:50:29.100 align:start position:0%
incorporate academic standards into what
 
01:50:31.310 --> 01:50:31.320 align:start position:0%
we're doing if we don't have something
 
01:50:32.930 --> 01:50:32.940 align:start position:0%
such as that
 
01:50:35.810 --> 01:50:35.820 align:start position:0%
how do how do you know teachers know
 
01:50:38.270 --> 01:50:38.280 align:start position:0%
what I should what I should be doing or
 
01:50:43.010 --> 01:50:43.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:44.570 --> 01:50:44.580 align:start position:0%
so I I don't know I'm not really
 
01:50:46.970 --> 01:50:46.980 align:start position:0%
supportive of the word comprehensive I'm
 
01:50:48.410 --> 01:50:48.420 align:start position:0%
I'm in support of the word mental health
 
01:50:49.729 --> 01:50:49.739 align:start position:0%
being in law
 
01:50:52.250 --> 01:50:52.260 align:start position:0%
uh it's just another laundry list of an
 
01:50:54.350 --> 01:50:54.360 align:start position:0%
element within Health that we already
 
01:50:57.470 --> 01:50:57.480 align:start position:0%
have and so if something comes out of
 
01:51:00.229 --> 01:51:00.239 align:start position:0%
306 we have it where you are going to be
 
01:51:02.209 --> 01:51:02.219 align:start position:0%
teaching it because it's in
 
01:51:07.250 --> 01:51:07.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:09.770 --> 01:51:09.780 align:start position:0%
for the discussion representative it
 
01:51:12.169 --> 01:51:12.179 align:start position:0%
already says Health it says you know
 
01:51:13.729 --> 01:51:13.739 align:start position:0%
find five
 
01:51:15.649 --> 01:51:15.659 align:start position:0%
health health hygiene health and
 
01:51:17.270 --> 01:51:17.280 align:start position:0%
interpersonal relationships it doesn't
 
01:51:19.910 --> 01:51:19.920 align:start position:0%
say physical health it just says health
 
01:51:26.450 --> 01:51:26.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:31.310 --> 01:51:31.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:34.729 --> 01:51:34.739 align:start position:0%
um my when I'm looking at at both of
 
01:51:36.169 --> 01:51:36.179 align:start position:0%
these the
 
01:51:38.209 --> 01:51:38.219 align:start position:0%
was it the 151
 
01:51:40.910 --> 01:51:40.920 align:start position:0%
can't remember
 
01:51:40.920 --> 01:51:42.530 align:start position:0%
can't remember
um

01:51:42.530 --> 01:51:42.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:51:47.570 --> 01:51:47.580 align:start position:0%
and the 505 you know I think that it it
 
01:51:49.790 --> 01:51:49.800 align:start position:0%
doesn't need to be in statute because
 
01:51:52.850 --> 01:51:52.860 align:start position:0%
it's already addressed I think the best
 
01:51:54.910 --> 01:51:54.920 align:start position:0%
place to
 
01:51:57.109 --> 01:51:57.119 align:start position:0%
specifically identify mental health
 
01:51:57.119 --> 01:51:58.370 align:start position:0%
specifically identify mental health
skills

01:51:58.370 --> 01:51:58.380 align:start position:0%
skills
 
01:52:01.209 --> 01:52:01.219 align:start position:0%
is in the rule making that describes
 
01:52:04.669 --> 01:52:04.679 align:start position:0%
what components schools need to have
 
01:52:06.890 --> 01:52:06.900 align:start position:0%
when I'm looking at the Texas one
 
01:52:09.169 --> 01:52:09.179 align:start position:0%
promote a positive School climate teach
 
01:52:11.810 --> 01:52:11.820 align:start position:0%
and support skills for social emotional
 
01:52:13.970 --> 01:52:13.980 align:start position:0%
behavioral needs and you know most
 
01:52:15.950 --> 01:52:15.960 align:start position:0%
schools have social emotional learning
 
01:52:18.169 --> 01:52:18.179 align:start position:0%
going on prevent mental health and
 
01:52:20.270 --> 01:52:20.280 align:start position:0%
substance use problems how can they
 
01:52:23.090 --> 01:52:23.100 align:start position:0%
intervene provide access to school-based
 
01:52:25.669 --> 01:52:25.679 align:start position:0%
and community-based interventions and
 
01:52:28.550 --> 01:52:28.560 align:start position:0%
supports to students and families and I
 
01:52:30.950 --> 01:52:30.960 align:start position:0%
would see that in a rule-making
 
01:52:33.169 --> 01:52:33.179 align:start position:0%
description of mental health or
 
01:52:35.689 --> 01:52:35.699 align:start position:0%
behavioral health because once you start
 
01:52:38.450 --> 01:52:38.460 align:start position:0%
listing all of the different components
 
01:52:41.330 --> 01:52:41.340 align:start position:0%
like bullying cyber bullying panic
 
01:52:43.490 --> 01:52:43.500 align:start position:0%
attacks depression
 
01:52:45.229 --> 01:52:45.239 align:start position:0%
I mean something else is going to come
 
01:52:47.290 --> 01:52:47.300 align:start position:0%
up and it's not going to be in the list
 
01:52:50.390 --> 01:52:50.400 align:start position:0%
I I think it's risky to list
 
01:52:52.850 --> 01:52:52.860 align:start position:0%
all of those things
 
01:52:55.370 --> 01:52:55.380 align:start position:0%
because it could be again a
 
01:52:58.609 --> 01:52:58.619 align:start position:0%
post-traumatic disorder it could be a
 
01:53:01.250 --> 01:53:01.260 align:start position:0%
toxic living and toxic stress a lot of
 
01:53:03.350 --> 01:53:03.360 align:start position:0%
kids live in that environment it could
 
01:53:04.729 --> 01:53:04.739 align:start position:0%
be the parents that have the mental
 
01:53:06.169 --> 01:53:06.179 align:start position:0%
health issue and the student doesn't
 
01:53:08.689 --> 01:53:08.699 align:start position:0%
know how to deal with it I just worry
 
01:53:11.530 --> 01:53:11.540 align:start position:0%
that by listing all of those pieces
 
01:53:14.330 --> 01:53:14.340 align:start position:0%
were um
 
01:53:17.570 --> 01:53:17.580 align:start position:0%
were too boxed in in terms of Aloft but
 
01:53:20.030 --> 01:53:20.040 align:start position:0%
if you have some regulated
 
01:53:23.390 --> 01:53:23.400 align:start position:0%
structures within a school of what needs
 
01:53:26.390 --> 01:53:26.400 align:start position:0%
to exist and again you know 10 15 years
 
01:53:28.010 --> 01:53:28.020 align:start position:0%
ago that's how positive behavior
 
01:53:30.649 --> 01:53:30.659 align:start position:0%
intervention Sports came about over time
 
01:53:32.750 --> 01:53:32.760 align:start position:0%
I've seen behavioral specialists added
 
01:53:36.470 --> 01:53:36.480 align:start position:0%
to School school Personnel I've seen Ed
 
01:53:40.310 --> 01:53:40.320 align:start position:0%
assistants trained in ABA which is
 
01:53:41.930 --> 01:53:41.940 align:start position:0%
um behavioral
 
01:53:44.570 --> 01:53:44.580 align:start position:0%
management from cognitive behavioral
 
01:53:47.030 --> 01:53:47.040 align:start position:0%
Theory I've seen student support centers
 
01:53:47.040 --> 01:53:48.410 align:start position:0%
Theory I've seen student support centers
grow

01:53:48.410 --> 01:53:48.420 align:start position:0%
grow
 
01:53:51.890 --> 01:53:51.900 align:start position:0%
in place of detention Halls
 
01:53:51.900 --> 01:53:53.209 align:start position:0%
in place of detention Halls
um

01:53:53.209 --> 01:53:53.219 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:53:56.090 --> 01:53:56.100 align:start position:0%
and those all address how kids
 
01:53:58.250 --> 01:53:58.260 align:start position:0%
adapt and behave in a school so I'd like
 
01:54:00.790 --> 01:54:00.800 align:start position:0%
to see it rulemaking
 
01:54:04.129 --> 01:54:04.139 align:start position:0%
that would include staff
 
01:54:06.830 --> 01:54:06.840 align:start position:0%
professional development
 
01:54:09.050 --> 01:54:09.060 align:start position:0%
not in a statute I think mental health
 
01:54:10.970 --> 01:54:10.980 align:start position:0%
covers it enough
 
01:54:13.370 --> 01:54:13.380 align:start position:0%
because it should a statute to in my
 
01:54:15.290 --> 01:54:15.300 align:start position:0%
mind should be Broad
 
01:54:17.090 --> 01:54:17.100 align:start position:0%
and then
 
01:54:19.729 --> 01:54:19.739 align:start position:0%
the 306s should be a little bit more
 
01:54:19.739 --> 01:54:21.470 align:start position:0%
the 306s should be a little bit more
descriptive

01:54:21.470 --> 01:54:21.480 align:start position:0%
descriptive
 
01:54:23.450 --> 01:54:23.460 align:start position:0%
and then the district identifies what
 
01:54:25.090 --> 01:54:25.100 align:start position:0%
works for them
 
01:54:28.729 --> 01:54:28.739 align:start position:0%
so are you nailing this down so you
 
01:54:30.890 --> 01:54:30.900 align:start position:0%
think that the rather than Comprehensive
 
01:54:32.450 --> 01:54:32.460 align:start position:0%
Mental Health it should be just mental
 
01:54:34.790 --> 01:54:34.800 align:start position:0%
health in statute or you're saying it
 
01:54:37.070 --> 01:54:37.080 align:start position:0%
should be just health and how we
 
01:54:39.109 --> 01:54:39.119 align:start position:0%
regulate this we don't have regulations
 
01:54:42.109 --> 01:54:42.119 align:start position:0%
feds do but we how we will make we put
 
01:54:45.410 --> 01:54:45.420 align:start position:0%
into rule making what health education
 
01:54:47.689 --> 01:54:47.699 align:start position:0%
is we don't do that though the State
 
01:54:50.209 --> 01:54:50.219 align:start position:0%
Board does that
 
01:54:53.330 --> 01:54:53.340 align:start position:0%
I I worry about a statute specifically
 
01:54:56.689 --> 01:54:56.699 align:start position:0%
identifying mental health does does is
 
01:54:58.070 --> 01:54:58.080 align:start position:0%
the perception of mental health
 
01:55:01.550 --> 01:55:01.560 align:start position:0%
something that's diagnosed in a DSM
 
01:55:01.560 --> 01:55:02.570 align:start position:0%
something that's diagnosed in a DSM
manual

01:55:02.570 --> 01:55:02.580 align:start position:0%
manual
 
01:55:05.629 --> 01:55:05.639 align:start position:0%
or does it also include
 
01:55:12.010 --> 01:55:12.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:14.870 --> 01:55:14.880 align:start position:0%
bullying is is a social you know
 
01:55:14.880 --> 01:55:17.570 align:start position:0%
bullying is is a social you know
Behavior

01:55:17.570 --> 01:55:17.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:20.149 --> 01:55:20.159 align:start position:0%
does mental health pocket it too much
 
01:55:23.209 --> 01:55:23.219 align:start position:0%
versus health because it's all of this
 
01:55:25.970 --> 01:55:25.980 align:start position:0%
all of these list of things in this
 
01:55:28.970 --> 01:55:28.980 align:start position:0%
in this draft bill you know talks about
 
01:55:31.310 --> 01:55:31.320 align:start position:0%
biological social environmental
 
01:55:33.530 --> 01:55:33.540 align:start position:0%
influences on Mental Health mental
 
01:55:36.530 --> 01:55:36.540 align:start position:0%
health disorders anxiety depression
 
01:55:39.950 --> 01:55:39.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:39.960 --> 01:55:41.330 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:55:41.330 --> 01:55:41.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:55:45.109 --> 01:55:45.119 align:start position:0%
you know there's a whole list of things
 
01:55:47.090 --> 01:55:47.100 align:start position:0%
I'm looking are you looking at the rules
 
01:55:50.649 --> 01:55:50.659 align:start position:0%
right now I'm looking at the draft 151
 
01:55:53.390 --> 01:55:53.400 align:start position:0%
are you looking at 151 yeah that's the
 
01:55:54.890 --> 01:55:54.900 align:start position:0%
other bill that's the other one we
 
01:55:58.790 --> 01:55:58.800 align:start position:0%
talked about yeah okay I I think it I I
 
01:56:00.410 --> 01:56:00.420 align:start position:0%
would be worried that something would be
 
01:56:05.950 --> 01:56:05.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:10.010 --> 01:56:10.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:12.290 --> 01:56:12.300 align:start position:0%
I agree with you to representative
 
01:56:12.300 --> 01:56:13.850 align:start position:0%
I agree with you to representative
cascaden

01:56:13.850 --> 01:56:13.860 align:start position:0%
cascaden
 
01:56:16.609 --> 01:56:16.619 align:start position:0%
um I think the danger with 151 is that
 
01:56:18.050 --> 01:56:18.060 align:start position:0%
this is going to become another Dumping
 
01:56:19.790 --> 01:56:19.800 align:start position:0%
Ground like
 
01:56:22.430 --> 01:56:22.440 align:start position:0%
um like the studies you're going to keep
 
01:56:22.440 --> 01:56:24.229 align:start position:0%
um like the studies you're going to keep
adding

01:56:24.229 --> 01:56:24.239 align:start position:0%
adding
 
01:56:27.310 --> 01:56:27.320 align:start position:0%
items to the list each year as some new
 
01:56:37.430 --> 01:56:37.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:39.950 --> 01:56:39.960 align:start position:0%
chair yeah yeah just to add to that what
 
01:56:42.530 --> 01:56:42.540 align:start position:0%
I find is the stumbling block
 
01:56:46.729 --> 01:56:46.739 align:start position:0%
is that some parents are not cooperative
 
01:56:49.370 --> 01:56:49.380 align:start position:0%
with trying to get treatment for their
 
01:56:51.830 --> 01:56:51.840 align:start position:0%
kids not all parents but occasionally
 
01:56:53.689 --> 01:56:53.699 align:start position:0%
you get parents that don't you know
 
01:56:56.450 --> 01:56:56.460 align:start position:0%
really don't want you to know what's
 
01:56:58.490 --> 01:56:58.500 align:start position:0%
really going on if your parents are drug
 
01:56:58.500 --> 01:56:59.629 align:start position:0%
really going on if your parents are drug
dealers

01:56:59.629 --> 01:56:59.639 align:start position:0%
dealers
 
01:57:02.030 --> 01:57:02.040 align:start position:0%
they'll do anything to like you know
 
01:57:04.790 --> 01:57:04.800 align:start position:0%
they'll go to open house and put on a
 
01:57:06.109 --> 01:57:06.119 align:start position:0%
nice space
 
01:57:08.330 --> 01:57:08.340 align:start position:0%
but deep down when that kid comes and
 
01:57:10.250 --> 01:57:10.260 align:start position:0%
he's pretty sullen
 
01:57:13.070 --> 01:57:13.080 align:start position:0%
you know that parent doesn't want you to
 
01:57:14.750 --> 01:57:14.760 align:start position:0%
dig into the
 
01:57:17.330 --> 01:57:17.340 align:start position:0%
the behaviors of that kid and that's the
 
01:57:17.340 --> 01:57:19.010 align:start position:0%
the behaviors of that kid and that's the
challenge

01:57:19.010 --> 01:57:19.020 align:start position:0%
challenge
 
01:57:19.020 --> 01:57:20.330 align:start position:0%
challenge
um

01:57:20.330 --> 01:57:20.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:57:22.550 --> 01:57:22.560 align:start position:0%
that is a challenge but I'd be curious
 
01:57:23.629 --> 01:57:23.639 align:start position:0%
to know
 
01:57:27.530 --> 01:57:27.540 align:start position:0%
how many schools are not really engaged
 
01:57:30.169 --> 01:57:30.179 align:start position:0%
in some of these
 
01:57:33.169 --> 01:57:33.179 align:start position:0%
um structures as a whole school
 
01:57:35.270 --> 01:57:35.280 align:start position:0%
and I don't know if officer students
 
01:57:37.070 --> 01:57:37.080 align:start position:0%
will show you some of that information
 
01:57:38.990 --> 01:57:39.000 align:start position:0%
it did show some but it didn't really
 
01:57:41.149 --> 01:57:41.159 align:start position:0%
not all of it I I yeah there are some
 
01:57:43.250 --> 01:57:43.260 align:start position:0%
topics here that it would be interesting
 
01:57:45.109 --> 01:57:45.119 align:start position:0%
to see I mean because you don't want to
 
01:57:48.470 --> 01:57:48.480 align:start position:0%
stigmatize kids because it's not their
 
01:57:48.480 --> 01:57:52.370 align:start position:0%
stigmatize kids because it's not their
fault

01:57:52.370 --> 01:57:52.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:55.550 --> 01:57:55.560 align:start position:0%
yes represent Belcher thank you Mr chair
 
01:57:57.229 --> 01:57:57.239 align:start position:0%
um it was mentioned earlier that we
 
01:57:59.570 --> 01:57:59.580 align:start position:0%
should be a bit introspective and look
 
01:58:01.609 --> 01:58:01.619 align:start position:0%
at what has been done in the past and
 
01:58:03.950 --> 01:58:03.960 align:start position:0%
why students might be having some mental
 
01:58:06.470 --> 01:58:06.480 align:start position:0%
health problems on that note I would let
 
01:58:08.689 --> 01:58:08.699 align:start position:0%
I would look to the the health education
 
01:58:10.370 --> 01:58:10.380 align:start position:0%
curriculum guidelines from New Hampshire
 
01:58:12.350 --> 01:58:12.360 align:start position:0%
from 2003
 
01:58:15.410 --> 01:58:15.420 align:start position:0%
page 117
 
01:58:20.629 --> 01:58:20.639 align:start position:0%
left hand side items 3.8 3.9 and 3.10
 
01:58:23.330 --> 01:58:23.340 align:start position:0%
this is Middle School curriculum
 
01:58:25.910 --> 01:58:25.920 align:start position:0%
how to advocate for needs and rights of
 
01:58:28.250 --> 01:58:28.260 align:start position:0%
others how to advocate for a healthy
 
01:58:30.649 --> 01:58:30.659 align:start position:0%
social environment how to advocate for
 
01:58:32.510 --> 01:58:32.520 align:start position:0%
fairness and over on the other side it
 
01:58:34.850 --> 01:58:34.860 align:start position:0%
says students must show awareness of
 
01:58:37.790 --> 01:58:37.800 align:start position:0%
audience and demonstrate passion and
 
01:58:40.850 --> 01:58:40.860 align:start position:0%
conviction in other words we have had
 
01:58:43.430 --> 01:58:43.440 align:start position:0%
guidelines for middle schools for 20
 
01:58:47.030 --> 01:58:47.040 align:start position:0%
years in this state to train students as
 
01:58:50.930 --> 01:58:50.940 align:start position:0%
social activists in schools maybe we
 
01:58:56.290 --> 01:58:56.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:01.490 --> 01:59:01.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:04.129 --> 01:59:04.139 align:start position:0%
try to provide awareness for students is
 
01:59:06.649 --> 01:59:06.659 align:start position:0%
not training it's not training them to
 
01:59:08.030 --> 01:59:08.040 align:start position:0%
be activists
 
01:59:12.410 --> 01:59:12.420 align:start position:0%
and I I object to the accusation that's
 
01:59:14.089 --> 01:59:14.099 align:start position:0%
what's happening at school so just to
 
01:59:15.229 --> 01:59:15.239 align:start position:0%
follow up or where you are
 
01:59:17.450 --> 01:59:17.460 align:start position:0%
representative Miler uh give you an
 
01:59:19.790 --> 01:59:19.800 align:start position:0%
example occurred three days ago or four
 
01:59:22.129 --> 01:59:22.139 align:start position:0%
days ago last Friday
 
01:59:25.430 --> 01:59:25.440 align:start position:0%
our kindergarten grandson was again put
 
01:59:27.530 --> 01:59:27.540 align:start position:0%
in the thinking chair
 
01:59:29.510 --> 01:59:29.520 align:start position:0%
and the thinking chair in the
 
01:59:32.089 --> 01:59:32.099 align:start position:0%
kindergarten class is where you think
 
01:59:34.790 --> 01:59:34.800 align:start position:0%
about which what choice you just made
 
01:59:38.390 --> 01:59:38.400 align:start position:0%
it's a way of addressing an issue and
 
01:59:40.250 --> 01:59:40.260 align:start position:0%
that was the second time he'd been in
 
01:59:42.830 --> 01:59:42.840 align:start position:0%
the thinking chair in the last three
 
01:59:46.189 --> 01:59:46.199 align:start position:0%
days and he came back and explained it
 
01:59:49.490 --> 01:59:49.500 align:start position:0%
to us and he's the youngest one in the
 
01:59:51.350 --> 01:59:51.360 align:start position:0%
class but he's also the largest one in
 
01:59:54.050 --> 01:59:54.060 align:start position:0%
the kindergarten class the birthday just
 
01:59:58.010 --> 01:59:58.020 align:start position:0%
this last month so that was something
 
02:00:00.649 --> 02:00:00.659 align:start position:0%
the teacher has responsibility for
 
02:00:03.350 --> 02:00:03.360 align:start position:0%
teaching you don't start laughing out
 
02:00:05.450 --> 02:00:05.460 align:start position:0%
loud at somebody else you think about
 
02:00:07.729 --> 02:00:07.739 align:start position:0%
and you make that choice but his
 
02:00:10.370 --> 02:00:10.380 align:start position:0%
response was while so and so made me do
 
02:00:13.129 --> 02:00:13.139 align:start position:0%
that now he has to learn that that comes
 
02:00:15.649 --> 02:00:15.659 align:start position:0%
from inside you do it yourself
 
02:00:19.070 --> 02:00:19.080 align:start position:0%
so I think that's part of what a teacher
 
02:00:20.870 --> 02:00:20.880 align:start position:0%
teaches in kindergarten everything you
 
02:00:23.149 --> 02:00:23.159 align:start position:0%
know in life you learn in kindergarten
 
02:00:26.870 --> 02:00:26.880 align:start position:0%
and and so I think that teachers all the
 
02:00:28.970 --> 02:00:28.980 align:start position:0%
way through these grades has that
 
02:00:31.250 --> 02:00:31.260 align:start position:0%
responsibility only a magnify it a
 
02:00:32.390 --> 02:00:32.400 align:start position:0%
little bit more should get up in the
 
02:00:32.400 --> 02:00:33.589 align:start position:0%
little bit more should get up in the
grades

02:00:33.589 --> 02:00:33.599 align:start position:0%
grades
 
02:00:37.550 --> 02:00:37.560 align:start position:0%
but uh I you know I'm
 
02:00:40.250 --> 02:00:40.260 align:start position:0%
I I just I I just don't know how quite
 
02:00:41.810 --> 02:00:41.820 align:start position:0%
to do this I don't mind putting mental
 
02:00:45.050 --> 02:00:45.060 align:start position:0%
health in but I I can't do comprehensive
 
02:00:48.290 --> 02:00:48.300 align:start position:0%
yes right so regretting coach yeah yeah
 
02:00:50.089 --> 02:00:50.099 align:start position:0%
yeah what you just talked about there
 
02:00:53.209 --> 02:00:53.219 align:start position:0%
though isn't that what comprehensive
 
02:00:55.910 --> 02:00:55.920 align:start position:0%
means I mean looking at you know this
 
02:00:58.550 --> 02:00:58.560 align:start position:0%
isn't my area so the stuff that um
 
02:01:00.169 --> 02:01:00.179 align:start position:0%
that's been discussed and the the
 
02:01:00.179 --> 02:01:01.910 align:start position:0%
that's been discussed and the the
handouts

02:01:01.910 --> 02:01:01.920 align:start position:0%
handouts
 
02:01:03.770 --> 02:01:03.780 align:start position:0%
um that that came out I think you know
 
02:01:06.470 --> 02:01:06.480 align:start position:0%
are are very informative
 
02:01:09.050 --> 02:01:09.060 align:start position:0%
um but when you take a look at at Texas
 
02:01:10.990 --> 02:01:11.000 align:start position:0%
and you take a look at the New Hampshire
 
02:01:13.970 --> 02:01:13.980 align:start position:0%
standard from 2003
 
02:01:18.109 --> 02:01:18.119 align:start position:0%
uh it real it's it it it there there's
 
02:01:21.709 --> 02:01:21.719 align:start position:0%
there's there's action elements to um to
 
02:01:23.750 --> 02:01:23.760 align:start position:0%
that like what you were just talking
 
02:01:26.149 --> 02:01:26.159 align:start position:0%
about happened to your grandson in in
 
02:01:29.450 --> 02:01:29.460 align:start position:0%
kindergarten but uh but going right
 
02:01:31.370 --> 02:01:31.380 align:start position:0%
through elementary and middle school and
 
02:01:35.030 --> 02:01:35.040 align:start position:0%
high school you know it it's not just
 
02:01:37.850 --> 02:01:37.860 align:start position:0%
mental health education it's not you
 
02:01:40.189 --> 02:01:40.199 align:start position:0%
know this is what he the the
 
02:01:44.390 --> 02:01:44.400 align:start position:0%
um the technical definition of ADHD or
 
02:01:47.330 --> 02:01:47.340 align:start position:0%
the technical definition of of different
 
02:01:49.430 --> 02:01:49.440 align:start position:0%
mental health disorders I don't think
 
02:01:51.530 --> 02:01:51.540 align:start position:0%
that's what what what what this is
 
02:01:53.810 --> 02:01:53.820 align:start position:0%
getting on the the bill sponsor is is
 
02:01:53.820 --> 02:01:55.129 align:start position:0%
getting on the the bill sponsor is is
here

02:01:55.129 --> 02:01:55.139 align:start position:0%
here
 
02:01:55.139 --> 02:01:55.970 align:start position:0%
here
um

02:01:55.970 --> 02:01:55.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:01:57.950 --> 02:01:57.960 align:start position:0%
um and and which feel are you talking
 
02:02:02.689 --> 02:02:02.699 align:start position:0%
about the the well the um uh 1505 505
 
02:02:05.030 --> 02:02:05.040 align:start position:0%
yeah okay and and um you know the one
 
02:02:06.470 --> 02:02:06.480 align:start position:0%
you were just referring to with the word
 
02:02:09.350 --> 02:02:09.360 align:start position:0%
comprehensive yeah in there but but I I
 
02:02:12.290 --> 02:02:12.300 align:start position:0%
you know I'm I'm taking that to mean at
 
02:02:16.310 --> 02:02:16.320 align:start position:0%
least based on on the bill language the
 
02:02:17.990 --> 02:02:18.000 align:start position:0%
the what you headed out from Texas
 
02:02:19.810 --> 02:02:19.820 align:start position:0%
Florida as well as the New Hampshire
 
02:02:23.270 --> 02:02:23.280 align:start position:0%
standards from 2003 that that that that
 
02:02:24.790 --> 02:02:24.800 align:start position:0%
that that
 
02:02:28.189 --> 02:02:28.199 align:start position:0%
goes beyond sort of like clinical uh
 
02:02:30.709 --> 02:02:30.719 align:start position:0%
definitions of mental health conditions
 
02:02:33.649 --> 02:02:33.659 align:start position:0%
and diagnoses but more of what to look
 
02:02:35.629 --> 02:02:35.639 align:start position:0%
for what to look for in yourself what to
 
02:02:37.609 --> 02:02:37.619 align:start position:0%
look for in your friends
 
02:02:40.550 --> 02:02:40.560 align:start position:0%
um the the self the um what you were
 
02:02:43.070 --> 02:02:43.080 align:start position:0%
just talking about with your grandson
 
02:02:45.589 --> 02:02:45.599 align:start position:0%
um you know it comes from within how to
 
02:02:47.089 --> 02:02:47.099 align:start position:0%
seek help
 
02:02:49.930 --> 02:02:49.940 align:start position:0%
um you know so it's it's it it's not
 
02:02:52.250 --> 02:02:52.260 align:start position:0%
self-diagnosis it's not medical school
 
02:02:54.709 --> 02:02:54.719 align:start position:0%
and I don't know maybe representative
 
02:02:57.589 --> 02:02:57.599 align:start position:0%
Newell can can shed some light on the
 
02:02:59.750 --> 02:02:59.760 align:start position:0%
intent of this
 
02:02:59.760 --> 02:03:01.250 align:start position:0%
intent of this
okay

02:03:01.250 --> 02:03:01.260 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:03:03.169 --> 02:03:03.179 align:start position:0%
well we've got a few hands up right now
 
02:03:04.370 --> 02:03:04.380 align:start position:0%
representative pedernal and then
 
02:03:06.410 --> 02:03:06.420 align:start position:0%
representative Tanner
 
02:03:08.330 --> 02:03:08.340 align:start position:0%
go ahead we've had other pieces of
 
02:03:11.810 --> 02:03:11.820 align:start position:0%
legislation come across our desks if you
 
02:03:15.410 --> 02:03:15.420 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:18.410 --> 02:03:18.420 align:start position:0%
the argument has been that
 
02:03:22.850 --> 02:03:22.860 align:start position:0%
adding curriculum to our legislation
 
02:03:25.370 --> 02:03:25.380 align:start position:0%
adds a burden to teachers and we've been
 
02:03:29.089 --> 02:03:29.099 align:start position:0%
told that we should trust teachers so I
 
02:03:31.310 --> 02:03:31.320 align:start position:0%
would argue that we should keep the
 
02:03:34.010 --> 02:03:34.020 align:start position:0%
legislation on the simpler side where it
 
02:03:36.169 --> 02:03:36.179 align:start position:0%
already is without adding
 
02:03:40.430 --> 02:03:40.440 align:start position:0%
either of these bills to the rsas and
 
02:03:42.290 --> 02:03:42.300 align:start position:0%
that we should trust the teachers that
 
02:03:44.629 --> 02:03:44.639 align:start position:0%
they are acting within the guidelines
 
02:03:46.790 --> 02:03:46.800 align:start position:0%
and teaching within the guidelines of
 
02:03:49.129 --> 02:03:49.139 align:start position:0%
what they've been told to do and what
 
02:03:50.390 --> 02:03:50.400 align:start position:0%
they think is right
 
02:03:53.450 --> 02:03:53.460 align:start position:0%
if we do as you're saying does should we
 
02:03:55.189 --> 02:03:55.199 align:start position:0%
then communicate with the state board
 
02:03:58.189 --> 02:03:58.199 align:start position:0%
when they come in here with 306 saying
 
02:04:00.589 --> 02:04:00.599 align:start position:0%
are you going to strip it out of
 
02:04:03.470 --> 02:04:03.480 align:start position:0%
the ed306 rules if you're going to strip
 
02:04:05.510 --> 02:04:05.520 align:start position:0%
it out at 306 rules
 
02:04:09.050 --> 02:04:09.060 align:start position:0%
and they have that ability to do that
 
02:04:11.689 --> 02:04:11.699 align:start position:0%
certainly then if we feel that this
 
02:04:13.850 --> 02:04:13.860 align:start position:0%
should be taught then why wouldn't we
 
02:04:15.830 --> 02:04:15.840 align:start position:0%
stick it in statute it should stay in
 
02:04:17.750 --> 02:04:17.760 align:start position:0%
the room it should be it could be more
 
02:04:19.490 --> 02:04:19.500 align:start position:0%
clearly defined in the rules that's what
 
02:04:21.109 --> 02:04:21.119 align:start position:0%
they're for right if they're willing to
 
02:04:23.810 --> 02:04:23.820 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:26.390 --> 02:04:26.400 align:start position:0%
representative Tanner
 
02:04:26.400 --> 02:04:26.990 align:start position:0%
representative Tanner
um

02:04:26.990 --> 02:04:27.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:04:28.729 --> 02:04:28.739 align:start position:0%
as I look at this
 
02:04:31.609 --> 02:04:31.619 align:start position:0%
um and I'm thinking what if what if this
 
02:04:32.930 --> 02:04:32.940 align:start position:0%
bill came through and it said
 
02:04:34.970 --> 02:04:34.980 align:start position:0%
comprehensive physical education or
 
02:04:36.890 --> 02:04:36.900 align:start position:0%
comprehensive hygiene
 
02:04:40.970 --> 02:04:40.980 align:start position:0%
and it it doesn't make kind of sense to
 
02:04:42.530 --> 02:04:42.540 align:start position:0%
me so
 
02:04:44.169 --> 02:04:44.179 align:start position:0%
um I know that
 
02:04:47.689 --> 02:04:47.699 align:start position:0%
comprehensive means all-encompassing and
 
02:04:50.149 --> 02:04:50.159 align:start position:0%
certainly uh representative cascadden
 
02:04:51.589 --> 02:04:51.599 align:start position:0%
has talked about how mental health
 
02:04:54.410 --> 02:04:54.420 align:start position:0%
really has to be a Continuum of not only
 
02:04:56.530 --> 02:04:56.540 align:start position:0%
education but Services
 
02:04:59.030 --> 02:04:59.040 align:start position:0%
I think that if we took comprehensive
 
02:05:01.070 --> 02:05:01.080 align:start position:0%
out of there that I certainly could
 
02:05:03.530 --> 02:05:03.540 align:start position:0%
support this bill to to have mental
 
02:05:06.589 --> 02:05:06.599 align:start position:0%
health education simply because
 
02:05:09.910 --> 02:05:09.920 align:start position:0%
um it's drawing attention to that issue
 
02:05:13.070 --> 02:05:13.080 align:start position:0%
that's so critical right now
 
02:05:15.410 --> 02:05:15.420 align:start position:0%
um that's why AIDS was put in there AIDS
 
02:05:17.229 --> 02:05:17.239 align:start position:0%
was put in there because in
 
02:05:19.970 --> 02:05:19.980 align:start position:0%
2003 when this was developed it was the
 
02:05:22.070 --> 02:05:22.080 align:start position:0%
leading cause of death
 
02:05:22.080 --> 02:05:22.669 align:start position:0%
leading cause of death
um

02:05:22.669 --> 02:05:22.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:05:25.370 --> 02:05:25.380 align:start position:0%
and thankfully it isn't now
 
02:05:26.750 --> 02:05:26.760 align:start position:0%
um so
 
02:05:29.689 --> 02:05:29.699 align:start position:0%
I as I said I would I would go with this
 
02:05:31.609 --> 02:05:31.619 align:start position:0%
bill taking comprehensive tend to agree
 
02:05:33.169 --> 02:05:33.179 align:start position:0%
with you representative Tanner you know
 
02:05:35.990 --> 02:05:36.000 align:start position:0%
you teach physical education
 
02:05:37.490 --> 02:05:37.500 align:start position:0%
um but you know I could also take
 
02:05:39.050 --> 02:05:39.060 align:start position:0%
Devil's Advocate and go the other side
 
02:05:42.070 --> 02:05:42.080 align:start position:0%
and say look at ad306 it talks about
 
02:05:45.290 --> 02:05:45.300 align:start position:0%
comprehensive guidance and counseling
 
02:05:48.109 --> 02:05:48.119 align:start position:0%
service or yeah a comprehensive guidance
 
02:05:50.570 --> 02:05:50.580 align:start position:0%
and counseling program
 
02:05:52.129 --> 02:05:52.139 align:start position:0%
you could just say a guidance and
 
02:05:53.689 --> 02:05:53.699 align:start position:0%
counseling program probably get the same
 
02:05:56.810 --> 02:05:56.820 align:start position:0%
thing you know comprehensive is
 
02:06:02.390 --> 02:06:02.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:04.550 --> 02:06:04.560 align:start position:0%
we're getting close to representative
 
02:06:04.560 --> 02:06:06.709 align:start position:0%
we're getting close to representative
Damon

02:06:06.709 --> 02:06:06.719 align:start position:0%
Damon
 
02:06:08.510 --> 02:06:08.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:06:11.570 --> 02:06:11.580 align:start position:0%
um so two things
 
02:06:14.149 --> 02:06:14.159 align:start position:0%
I really think it is very important that
 
02:06:16.850 --> 02:06:16.860 align:start position:0%
we specify Mental Health
 
02:06:20.089 --> 02:06:20.099 align:start position:0%
when you simply say health it is not
 
02:06:22.850 --> 02:06:22.860 align:start position:0%
commonly perceived to go beyond physical
 
02:06:25.790 --> 02:06:25.800 align:start position:0%
health and we've had that come up in
 
02:06:28.070 --> 02:06:28.080 align:start position:0%
committee on other bills
 
02:06:30.950 --> 02:06:30.960 align:start position:0%
and I have remarked as I have in many
 
02:06:34.250 --> 02:06:34.260 align:start position:0%
circumstances over the years I wish that
 
02:06:35.510 --> 02:06:35.520 align:start position:0%
Mental Health
 
02:06:38.089 --> 02:06:38.099 align:start position:0%
or automatically included in the
 
02:06:39.470 --> 02:06:39.480 align:start position:0%
umbrella under health
 
02:06:41.209 --> 02:06:41.219 align:start position:0%
because the brains an organ and the
 
02:06:42.830 --> 02:06:42.840 align:start position:0%
hearts and organ and it's all connected
 
02:06:45.589 --> 02:06:45.599 align:start position:0%
why do we distinguish between conditions
 
02:06:47.570 --> 02:06:47.580 align:start position:0%
that affect the mind versus the rest of
 
02:06:50.209 --> 02:06:50.219 align:start position:0%
the body but we do as a society
 
02:06:53.270 --> 02:06:53.280 align:start position:0%
distinguish that all the time in all
 
02:06:56.629 --> 02:06:56.639 align:start position:0%
kinds of contexts so I don't think if we
 
02:06:58.609 --> 02:06:58.619 align:start position:0%
leave it as health that we are being
 
02:07:00.530 --> 02:07:00.540 align:start position:0%
adequate at all to our students I think
 
02:07:04.010 --> 02:07:04.020 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:07.550 --> 02:07:07.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:10.609 --> 02:07:10.619 align:start position:0%
I feel a responsibility to the many
 
02:07:12.649 --> 02:07:12.659 align:start position:0%
people that I know
 
02:07:14.330 --> 02:07:14.340 align:start position:0%
personally and professionally over the
 
02:07:16.129 --> 02:07:16.139 align:start position:0%
years who have experienced mental
 
02:07:16.139 --> 02:07:17.750 align:start position:0%
years who have experienced mental
illness

02:07:17.750 --> 02:07:17.760 align:start position:0%
illness
 
02:07:19.490 --> 02:07:19.500 align:start position:0%
and I would
 
02:07:21.350 --> 02:07:21.360 align:start position:0%
request that we not call these
 
02:07:23.990 --> 02:07:24.000 align:start position:0%
conditions the malady du jour I think it
 
02:07:25.669 --> 02:07:25.679 align:start position:0%
makes light of things that are very
 
02:07:27.950 --> 02:07:27.960 align:start position:0%
challenging for people to deal with
 
02:07:30.950 --> 02:07:30.960 align:start position:0%
and I needed to say that thank you well
 
02:07:33.470 --> 02:07:33.480 align:start position:0%
I think by that last comment we're there
 
02:07:34.910 --> 02:07:34.920 align:start position:0%
are a lot of elements or components
 
02:07:36.770 --> 02:07:36.780 align:start position:0%
underneath health and that was the
 
02:07:40.669 --> 02:07:40.679 align:start position:0%
reference to all those components so
 
02:07:43.490 --> 02:07:43.500 align:start position:0%
um if they're going to Define it and
 
02:07:45.770 --> 02:07:45.780 align:start position:0%
have it in rules I'm good with it being
 
02:07:48.109 --> 02:07:48.119 align:start position:0%
there but if they don't I'm good with
 
02:07:51.950 --> 02:07:51.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:55.430 --> 02:07:55.440 align:start position:0%
not comprehensive middle Mental Health
 
02:07:58.250 --> 02:07:58.260 align:start position:0%
well we're right now at five after 12
 
02:07:59.750 --> 02:07:59.760 align:start position:0%
and we do have another one starting at
 
02:08:01.370 --> 02:08:01.380 align:start position:0%
one o'clock but I think we're a little
 
02:08:03.649 --> 02:08:03.659 align:start position:0%
closer of understanding what we've got
 
02:08:06.410 --> 02:08:06.420 align:start position:0%
here in front of us the the third bill
 
02:08:08.689 --> 02:08:08.699 align:start position:0%
which we really didn't talk a lot talks
 
02:08:12.169 --> 02:08:12.179 align:start position:0%
about putting this into adequacy
 
02:08:14.209 --> 02:08:14.219 align:start position:0%
and I think that's
 
02:08:15.830 --> 02:08:15.840 align:start position:0%
that's really
 
02:08:15.840 --> 02:08:17.270 align:start position:0%
that's really
dangerous

02:08:17.270 --> 02:08:17.280 align:start position:0%
dangerous
 
02:08:19.070 --> 02:08:19.080 align:start position:0%
I think it needs to be if it's going to
 
02:08:20.450 --> 02:08:20.460 align:start position:0%
be in a statute it has to be somewhere
 
02:08:22.070 --> 02:08:22.080 align:start position:0%
else in statute
 
02:08:24.350 --> 02:08:24.360 align:start position:0%
like studies
 
02:08:26.450 --> 02:08:26.460 align:start position:0%
any further comments for today on this
 
02:08:28.609 --> 02:08:28.619 align:start position:0%
one so we will meet again in October
 
02:08:30.109 --> 02:08:30.119 align:start position:0%
what was the date
 
02:08:30.119 --> 02:08:34.910 align:start position:0%
what was the date
um

02:08:34.910 --> 02:08:34.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:40.970 --> 02:08:40.980 align:start position:0%
uh October 12th right October 12th so
 
02:08:43.729 --> 02:08:43.739 align:start position:0%
yeah so if you have something that you
 
02:08:46.490 --> 02:08:46.500 align:start position:0%
you'd like to see the bill tweaked a
 
02:08:48.290 --> 02:08:48.300 align:start position:0%
little bit come in with some bullet
 
02:08:49.790 --> 02:08:49.800 align:start position:0%
points or something such as that which
 
02:08:52.250 --> 02:08:52.260 align:start position:0%
we might be able to look at at the next
 
02:08:54.290 --> 02:08:54.300 align:start position:0%
meeting remember we have to make this
 
02:09:00.709 --> 02:09:00.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:04.490 --> 02:09:04.500 align:start position:0%
reporting on any well no as a
 
02:09:04.500 --> 02:09:05.930 align:start position:0%
reporting on any well no as a
subcommittee

02:09:05.930 --> 02:09:05.940 align:start position:0%
subcommittee
 
02:09:08.870 --> 02:09:08.880 align:start position:0%
we could vote any time to make a
 
02:09:08.880 --> 02:09:10.030 align:start position:0%
we could vote any time to make a
recommendation

02:09:10.030 --> 02:09:10.040 align:start position:0%
recommendation
 
02:09:13.370 --> 02:09:13.380 align:start position:0%
to the education committee we are at the
 
02:09:15.229 --> 02:09:15.239 align:start position:0%
committee of the whole right now
 
02:09:18.169 --> 02:09:18.179 align:start position:0%
even though we're the same people
 
02:09:20.689 --> 02:09:20.699 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:23.950 --> 02:09:23.960 align:start position:0%
okay represent Damon
 
02:09:26.930 --> 02:09:26.940 align:start position:0%
I just wondered if in the scheduling was
 
02:09:29.149 --> 02:09:29.159 align:start position:0%
it noted that Friday the 6th is the
 
02:09:31.189 --> 02:09:31.199 align:start position:0%
Friday of Columbus Day weekend
 
02:09:33.770 --> 02:09:33.780 align:start position:0%
and whether that is relevant to other
 
02:09:35.629 --> 02:09:35.639 align:start position:0%
folks or not I think there's
 
02:09:39.709 --> 02:09:39.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:42.410 --> 02:09:42.420 align:start position:0%
all right representative it's also a no
 
02:09:44.930 --> 02:09:44.940 align:start position:0%
school day uh for many many schools
 
02:09:46.310 --> 02:09:46.320 align:start position:0%
because of professional development
 
02:09:49.189 --> 02:09:49.199 align:start position:0%
that's the day of the Nea instructional
 
02:09:50.870 --> 02:09:50.880 align:start position:0%
conference I believe
 
02:09:54.589 --> 02:09:54.599 align:start position:0%
yep on that Friday the 6th it's a day of
 
02:09:56.089 --> 02:09:56.099 align:start position:0%
the instructional conference so a lot of
 
02:09:58.310 --> 02:09:58.320 align:start position:0%
kids aren't in school that day
 
02:09:58.320 --> 02:10:06.669 align:start position:0%
kids aren't in school that day
thought

02:10:06.669 --> 02:10:06.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:11.270 --> 02:10:11.280 align:start position:0%
the 10th is the sixth is October 6th
 
02:10:15.430 --> 02:10:15.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:18.649 --> 02:10:18.659 align:start position:0%
well we could move that to the fifth
 
02:10:21.890 --> 02:10:21.900 align:start position:0%
we could move them all to the fifth
 
02:10:23.750 --> 02:10:23.760 align:start position:0%
thank you very much appreciate it okay
 
02:10:25.629 --> 02:10:25.639 align:start position:0%
that's good that's good input
 
02:10:31.390 --> 02:10:31.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:31.400 --> 02:10:33.350 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

02:10:33.350 --> 02:10:33.360 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:10:35.990 --> 02:10:36.000 align:start position:0%
you know talking about Columbus Day
 
02:10:37.910 --> 02:10:37.920 align:start position:0%
up in the district where my kids are
 
02:10:39.290 --> 02:10:39.300 align:start position:0%
going to school one school doesn't
 
02:10:41.089 --> 02:10:41.099 align:start position:0%
recognize it as Columbus Day it's
 
02:10:44.629 --> 02:10:44.639 align:start position:0%
indigenous day the other the school
 
02:10:46.250 --> 02:10:46.260 align:start position:0%
district itself and another school
 
02:10:49.010 --> 02:10:49.020 align:start position:0%
recognizes it as Columbus Day so
 
02:10:50.450 --> 02:10:50.460 align:start position:0%
internally within the district they
 
02:10:53.089 --> 02:10:53.099 align:start position:0%
can't even get their act together
 
02:10:55.390 --> 02:10:55.400 align:start position:0%
so um
 
02:10:58.430 --> 02:10:58.440 align:start position:0%
it'd be October 5th all those scheduled
 
02:11:05.169 --> 02:11:05.179 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:05.179 --> 02:11:12.250 align:start position:0%
 
job

02:11:12.250 --> 02:11:12.260 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:21.430 --> 02:11:21.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:24.410 --> 02:11:24.420 align:start position:0%
but you know if on the subcommittee if
 
02:11:26.030 --> 02:11:26.040 align:start position:0%
you're not going to be there you can
 
02:11:28.490 --> 02:11:28.500 align:start position:0%
tell Mel put somebody else on there on
 
02:11:38.689 --> 02:11:38.699 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:41.810 --> 02:11:41.820 align:start position:0%
yeah we're all done we're all done thank
 
02:11:41.820 --> 02:11:43.940 align:start position:0%
yeah we're all done we're all done thank
you
