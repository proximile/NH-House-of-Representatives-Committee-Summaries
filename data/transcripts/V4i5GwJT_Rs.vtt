00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:54.720 align:start position:0%
a bill that i always refer to as the
 
00:06:57.909 --> 00:06:57.919 align:start position:0%
a4plex is a house bill
 
00:07:01.589 --> 00:07:01.599 align:start position:0%
and the reason a fourplex is a house is
 
00:07:03.589 --> 00:07:03.599 align:start position:0%
because that's what
 
00:07:03.599 --> 00:07:04.629 align:start position:0%
because that's what
the

00:07:04.629 --> 00:07:04.639 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:07:07.589 --> 00:07:07.599 align:start position:0%
federal loan agencies regarded as new
 
00:07:09.909 --> 00:07:09.919 align:start position:0%
hampshire has a housing crisis
 
00:07:12.469 --> 00:07:12.479 align:start position:0%
we all know that we are at least 20 000
 
00:07:15.430 --> 00:07:15.440 align:start position:0%
units short and have been for some time
 
00:07:18.629 --> 00:07:18.639 align:start position:0%
when i was a newspaper reporter in 1984
 
00:07:20.309 --> 00:07:20.319 align:start position:0%
one of the things that i remember
 
00:07:20.319 --> 00:07:21.430 align:start position:0%
one of the things that i remember
covering

00:07:21.430 --> 00:07:21.440 align:start position:0%
covering
 
00:07:23.749 --> 00:07:23.759 align:start position:0%
was amherst new hampshire's
 
00:07:26.710 --> 00:07:26.720 align:start position:0%
panic about the fact that they could not
 
00:07:29.189 --> 00:07:29.199 align:start position:0%
field a fire department
 
00:07:32.710 --> 00:07:32.720 align:start position:0%
because no one could afford to live in
 
00:07:36.469 --> 00:07:36.479 align:start position:0%
town and work in town who's also served
 
00:07:38.230 --> 00:07:38.240 align:start position:0%
on the fire department but they couldn't
 
00:07:39.670 --> 00:07:39.680 align:start position:0%
afford to live in town because it was
 
00:07:42.469 --> 00:07:42.479 align:start position:0%
too expensive so this is a thing that
 
00:07:45.150 --> 00:07:45.160 align:start position:0%
i've been hearing people talk about for
 
00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:49.440 align:start position:0%
38 years and we have not made much
 
00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:50.790 align:start position:0%
38 years and we have not made much
progress

00:07:50.790 --> 00:07:50.800 align:start position:0%
progress
 
00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:51.830 align:start position:0%
progress
and

00:07:51.830 --> 00:07:51.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:07:54.710 --> 00:07:54.720 align:start position:0%
what i'm hoping to do with this bill
 
00:07:58.869 --> 00:07:58.879 align:start position:0%
is to allow gradual increases
 
00:08:02.390 --> 00:08:02.400 align:start position:0%
of residential units in neighborhoods
 
00:08:05.990 --> 00:08:06.000 align:start position:0%
that are served by municipal water and
 
00:08:09.029 --> 00:08:09.039 align:start position:0%
sewer this bill doesn't have anything to
 
00:08:11.029 --> 00:08:11.039 align:start position:0%
do with places out in the country that
 
00:08:12.790 --> 00:08:12.800 align:start position:0%
have a well and septic
 
00:08:14.950 --> 00:08:14.960 align:start position:0%
doesn't have anything to do with three
 
00:08:18.230 --> 00:08:18.240 align:start position:0%
lot subdivisions with well and septic
 
00:08:21.830 --> 00:08:21.840 align:start position:0%
this is only places that already exist
 
00:08:25.189 --> 00:08:25.199 align:start position:0%
that have water and sewer provided by
 
00:08:28.070 --> 00:08:28.080 align:start position:0%
the municipality and already existing
 
00:08:30.790 --> 00:08:30.800 align:start position:0%
roads and the roads are a thing
 
00:08:32.550 --> 00:08:32.560 align:start position:0%
because it cost four dollars and
 
00:08:35.509 --> 00:08:35.519 align:start position:0%
sixty-five cents a center-line foot
 
00:08:38.709 --> 00:08:38.719 align:start position:0%
to salt sand plowed ditch and mow
 
00:08:41.909 --> 00:08:41.919 align:start position:0%
a foot of town-owned land and that's
 
00:08:44.070 --> 00:08:44.080 align:start position:0%
pretty generally true across the state i
 
00:08:45.670 --> 00:08:45.680 align:start position:0%
checked with the d.o.t
 
00:08:48.710 --> 00:08:48.720 align:start position:0%
so if we can use those roads we already
 
00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:49.750 align:start position:0%
so if we can use those roads we already
have

00:08:49.750 --> 00:08:49.760 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:08:52.829 --> 00:08:52.839 align:start position:0%
that's a better deal for
 
00:08:56.310 --> 00:08:56.320 align:start position:0%
everyone so 20 000 units short how did
 
00:08:57.670 --> 00:08:57.680 align:start position:0%
we get here
 
00:09:00.389 --> 00:09:00.399 align:start position:0%
we got here because over the last 50
 
00:09:03.430 --> 00:09:03.440 align:start position:0%
years or maybe even 75 we've
 
00:09:05.269 --> 00:09:05.279 align:start position:0%
artificially constrained the production
 
00:09:07.990 --> 00:09:08.000 align:start position:0%
of housing and we have privileged the
 
00:09:12.470 --> 00:09:12.480 align:start position:0%
production of two kinds of housing only
 
00:09:14.310 --> 00:09:14.320 align:start position:0%
single-family houses
 
00:09:16.710 --> 00:09:16.720 align:start position:0%
and big apartment complexes those are
 
00:09:18.949 --> 00:09:18.959 align:start position:0%
the things that we've made it easy to
 
00:09:21.269 --> 00:09:21.279 align:start position:0%
build and we've made it easier to build
 
00:09:23.670 --> 00:09:23.680 align:start position:0%
single-family residences than apartment
 
00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:25.269 align:start position:0%
single-family residences than apartment
complexes

00:09:25.269 --> 00:09:25.279 align:start position:0%
complexes
 
00:09:28.230 --> 00:09:28.240 align:start position:0%
so what we have is we have a lot of
 
00:09:31.269 --> 00:09:31.279 align:start position:0%
single-family and some big apartment
 
00:09:35.670 --> 00:09:35.680 align:start position:0%
complexes and nothing in the middle
 
00:09:38.470 --> 00:09:38.480 align:start position:0%
in my day job i'm a i'm an urban planner
 
00:09:40.790 --> 00:09:40.800 align:start position:0%
and we talk a lot about what we call the
 
00:09:43.110 --> 00:09:43.120 align:start position:0%
missing middle and that's
 
00:09:46.310 --> 00:09:46.320 align:start position:0%
everything between a duplex and a small
 
00:09:49.110 --> 00:09:49.120 align:start position:0%
apartment building duplexes triples
 
00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:50.389 align:start position:0%
apartment building duplexes triples
quads

00:09:50.389 --> 00:09:50.399 align:start position:0%
quads
 
00:09:51.829 --> 00:09:51.839 align:start position:0%
cottage courts
 
00:09:54.389 --> 00:09:54.399 align:start position:0%
dignified small apartment buildings we
 
00:09:56.790 --> 00:09:56.800 align:start position:0%
used to build those because financially
 
00:09:59.350 --> 00:09:59.360 align:start position:0%
they make a lot of sense and if you look
 
00:10:01.750 --> 00:10:01.760 align:start position:0%
at any established neighborhood
 
00:10:04.710 --> 00:10:04.720 align:start position:0%
in any city you'll see examples of those
 
00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:05.750 align:start position:0%
in any city you'll see examples of those
things

00:10:05.750 --> 00:10:05.760 align:start position:0%
things
 
00:10:07.350 --> 00:10:07.360 align:start position:0%
sometimes you can't tell that they're
 
00:10:09.350 --> 00:10:09.360 align:start position:0%
not a single family house
 
00:10:12.310 --> 00:10:12.320 align:start position:0%
but our zoning has made it really hard
 
00:10:15.590 --> 00:10:15.600 align:start position:0%
not to say impossible to build any more
 
00:10:16.949 --> 00:10:16.959 align:start position:0%
of this
 
00:10:20.470 --> 00:10:20.480 align:start position:0%
so part of our housing crisis is caused
 
00:10:23.269 --> 00:10:23.279 align:start position:0%
by down zoning making it impossible to
 
00:10:25.030 --> 00:10:25.040 align:start position:0%
build anything except a single-family
 
00:10:27.430 --> 00:10:27.440 align:start position:0%
residence more than 75 percent of
 
00:10:29.190 --> 00:10:29.200 align:start position:0%
nashua's land area is zoned
 
00:10:31.750 --> 00:10:31.760 align:start position:0%
single-family only
 
00:10:34.550 --> 00:10:34.560 align:start position:0%
the other part of it some so some
 
00:10:37.829 --> 00:10:37.839 align:start position:0%
some was intended but some of it was
 
00:10:39.990 --> 00:10:40.000 align:start position:0%
intended but didn't work out the way we
 
00:10:42.949 --> 00:10:42.959 align:start position:0%
thought sometimes places required larger
 
00:10:44.550 --> 00:10:44.560 align:start position:0%
lots because they were worried about
 
00:10:47.509 --> 00:10:47.519 align:start position:0%
having more kids in school
 
00:10:49.190 --> 00:10:49.200 align:start position:0%
and that meant that you got bigger
 
00:10:51.030 --> 00:10:51.040 align:start position:0%
houses on bigger lots and they cost more
 
00:10:54.550 --> 00:10:54.560 align:start position:0%
money and they still cost more money
 
00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:55.509 align:start position:0%
money and they still cost more money
so

00:10:55.509 --> 00:10:55.519 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:10:58.230 --> 00:10:58.240 align:start position:0%
we've frozen these places that are
 
00:11:00.790 --> 00:11:00.800 align:start position:0%
served by water and tour and sewer so
 
00:11:02.710 --> 00:11:02.720 align:start position:0%
that they can't change whatever that's
 
00:11:05.990 --> 00:11:06.000 align:start position:0%
there now is all that there can be what
 
00:11:07.750 --> 00:11:07.760 align:start position:0%
this bill would do
 
00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:08.829 align:start position:0%
this bill would do
is

00:11:08.829 --> 00:11:08.839 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:11:08.839 --> 00:11:10.550 align:start position:0%
is
re-legalize

00:11:10.550 --> 00:11:10.560 align:start position:0%
re-legalize
 
00:11:13.990 --> 00:11:14.000 align:start position:0%
up to four units only four that's a
 
00:11:17.509 --> 00:11:17.519 align:start position:0%
house the fha thinks it's a house
 
00:11:20.630 --> 00:11:20.640 align:start position:0%
it's a house it's house sized
 
00:11:23.750 --> 00:11:23.760 align:start position:0%
the bill also makes it clear that
 
00:11:25.750 --> 00:11:25.760 align:start position:0%
the buildings that could be newly
 
00:11:27.430 --> 00:11:27.440 align:start position:0%
constructed under this bill have to
 
00:11:29.269 --> 00:11:29.279 align:start position:0%
abide by the same rules as a single
 
00:11:30.550 --> 00:11:30.560 align:start position:0%
family house
 
00:11:33.430 --> 00:11:33.440 align:start position:0%
so if your zoning code says
 
00:11:35.430 --> 00:11:35.440 align:start position:0%
that the setbacks for a single family
 
00:11:36.710 --> 00:11:36.720 align:start position:0%
house are
 
00:11:38.870 --> 00:11:38.880 align:start position:0%
10 feet on each side and 30 feet at the
 
00:11:41.110 --> 00:11:41.120 align:start position:0%
back and whatever it is in the front if
 
00:11:42.870 --> 00:11:42.880 align:start position:0%
you build a fourplex it would have to
 
00:11:45.670 --> 00:11:45.680 align:start position:0%
revive by the same rules or a duplex or
 
00:11:47.190 --> 00:11:47.200 align:start position:0%
a triple
 
00:11:49.910 --> 00:11:49.920 align:start position:0%
if you have 30 lot coverage you have to
 
00:11:52.069 --> 00:11:52.079 align:start position:0%
have you can't have more than 30 lot
 
00:11:52.079 --> 00:11:53.030 align:start position:0%
have you can't have more than 30 lot
coverage

00:11:53.030 --> 00:11:53.040 align:start position:0%
coverage
 
00:11:55.110 --> 00:11:55.120 align:start position:0%
with a with a
 
00:11:57.269 --> 00:11:57.279 align:start position:0%
building that has more units
 
00:11:59.910 --> 00:11:59.920 align:start position:0%
and what about the parking
 
00:12:03.590 --> 00:12:03.600 align:start position:0%
the parking is is geared to the dwelling
 
00:12:05.430 --> 00:12:05.440 align:start position:0%
unit number
 
00:12:08.949 --> 00:12:08.959 align:start position:0%
so that if your code says that for every
 
00:12:11.829 --> 00:12:11.839 align:start position:0%
dwelling unit you have to have as one
 
00:12:13.910 --> 00:12:13.920 align:start position:0%
space or a space and a half or two
 
00:12:17.590 --> 00:12:17.600 align:start position:0%
spaces then a a duplex a triple and a
 
00:12:19.910 --> 00:12:19.920 align:start position:0%
quad would have to have two three or
 
00:12:22.710 --> 00:12:22.720 align:start position:0%
four times that number
 
00:12:24.150 --> 00:12:24.160 align:start position:0%
and you're gonna have to figure out how
 
00:12:26.790 --> 00:12:26.800 align:start position:0%
to get that on the parcel
 
00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:28.230 align:start position:0%
to get that on the parcel
um

00:12:28.230 --> 00:12:28.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:31.030 --> 00:12:31.040 align:start position:0%
so this bill legalizes missing middle
 
00:12:33.430 --> 00:12:33.440 align:start position:0%
housing by making up to four units
 
00:12:35.030 --> 00:12:35.040 align:start position:0%
permissible by right on any
 
00:12:37.430 --> 00:12:37.440 align:start position:0%
residentially zoned lot with municipal
 
00:12:38.949 --> 00:12:38.959 align:start position:0%
water and sewer
 
00:12:40.870 --> 00:12:40.880 align:start position:0%
just like all of our favorite
 
00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:42.069 align:start position:0%
just like all of our favorite
neighborhoods

00:12:42.069 --> 00:12:42.079 align:start position:0%
neighborhoods
 
00:12:43.829 --> 00:12:43.839 align:start position:0%
part of the reason that our favorite
 
00:12:46.629 --> 00:12:46.639 align:start position:0%
neighborhoods are wildly expensive
 
00:12:50.230 --> 00:12:50.240 align:start position:0%
is because we stopped building them we
 
00:12:52.389 --> 00:12:52.399 align:start position:0%
made it illegal to build them
 
00:12:54.389 --> 00:12:54.399 align:start position:0%
people want to live
 
00:12:57.030 --> 00:12:57.040 align:start position:0%
in proximity if that's what they want
 
00:12:59.670 --> 00:12:59.680 align:start position:0%
and we had we don't have enough of it we
 
00:13:01.670 --> 00:13:01.680 align:start position:0%
have enough of things out in the country
 
00:13:04.230 --> 00:13:04.240 align:start position:0%
but we don't have enough things where i
 
00:13:06.150 --> 00:13:06.160 align:start position:0%
can walk to the corner store and buy a
 
00:13:08.629 --> 00:13:08.639 align:start position:0%
quart of milk where i can let my child
 
00:13:10.870 --> 00:13:10.880 align:start position:0%
ride their bicycle to
 
00:13:13.110 --> 00:13:13.120 align:start position:0%
the corner store and get a popsicle and
 
00:13:15.829 --> 00:13:15.839 align:start position:0%
get home before it melts we don't have
 
00:13:17.350 --> 00:13:17.360 align:start position:0%
enough of that and that makes those
 
00:13:19.590 --> 00:13:19.600 align:start position:0%
places that do exist
 
00:13:22.710 --> 00:13:22.720 align:start position:0%
really really expensive
 
00:13:25.190 --> 00:13:25.200 align:start position:0%
and it's pressure from both ends of the
 
00:13:28.389 --> 00:13:28.399 align:start position:0%
demographics people my age want that
 
00:13:31.030 --> 00:13:31.040 align:start position:0%
people my kids age want that people in
 
00:13:32.870 --> 00:13:32.880 align:start position:0%
the middle want that
 
00:13:35.509 --> 00:13:35.519 align:start position:0%
and we need to make that happen we need
 
00:13:38.470 --> 00:13:38.480 align:start position:0%
to let that happen in a way that is
 
00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:39.910 align:start position:0%
to let that happen in a way that is
incremental

00:13:39.910 --> 00:13:39.920 align:start position:0%
incremental
 
00:13:43.269 --> 00:13:43.279 align:start position:0%
and will not disrupt the fabric
 
00:13:44.790 --> 00:13:44.800 align:start position:0%
of the neighborhood
 
00:13:46.870 --> 00:13:46.880 align:start position:0%
and let's talk about demographics for a
 
00:13:50.069 --> 00:13:50.079 align:start position:0%
minute we have a big
 
00:13:53.350 --> 00:13:53.360 align:start position:0%
number of big single-family houses we
 
00:13:57.189 --> 00:13:57.199 align:start position:0%
don't have a lot of anything else except
 
00:13:59.829 --> 00:13:59.839 align:start position:0%
you know big apartment complexes which
 
00:14:02.949 --> 00:14:02.959 align:start position:0%
i think most of us are in agreement that
 
00:14:05.030 --> 00:14:05.040 align:start position:0%
we don't want a lot of those in our
 
00:14:09.030 --> 00:14:09.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:10.069 align:start position:0%
 
and

00:14:10.069 --> 00:14:10.079 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:14:11.590 --> 00:14:11.600 align:start position:0%
right now
 
00:14:14.829 --> 00:14:14.839 align:start position:0%
within the next five years 75 of all
 
00:14:16.949 --> 00:14:16.959 align:start position:0%
households in the united states are
 
00:14:18.870 --> 00:14:18.880 align:start position:0%
going to be one and two-person
 
00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:20.389 align:start position:0%
going to be one and two-person
households

00:14:20.389 --> 00:14:20.399 align:start position:0%
households
 
00:14:21.590 --> 00:14:21.600 align:start position:0%
there are
 
00:14:25.750 --> 00:14:25.760 align:start position:0%
already fewer than one-fifth 20
 
00:14:28.069 --> 00:14:28.079 align:start position:0%
of all households have
 
00:14:30.389 --> 00:14:30.399 align:start position:0%
children in school
 
00:14:33.910 --> 00:14:33.920 align:start position:0%
so we're becoming a nation of smaller
 
00:14:37.509 --> 00:14:37.519 align:start position:0%
households with fewer children and we
 
00:14:39.509 --> 00:14:39.519 align:start position:0%
have not kept up
 
00:14:43.350 --> 00:14:43.360 align:start position:0%
in our building to meet that need in any
 
00:14:46.629 --> 00:14:46.639 align:start position:0%
way we just haven't and as i said when i
 
00:14:48.870 --> 00:14:48.880 align:start position:0%
started this is a conversation we've
 
00:14:50.069 --> 00:14:50.079 align:start position:0%
been having
 
00:14:50.079 --> 00:14:51.189 align:start position:0%
been having
for

00:14:51.189 --> 00:14:51.199 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:14:54.949 --> 00:14:54.959 align:start position:0%
in my ears 38 years
 
00:14:56.710 --> 00:14:56.720 align:start position:0%
we need to do something
 
00:14:58.230 --> 00:14:58.240 align:start position:0%
is this going to solve all our housing
 
00:14:58.240 --> 00:14:59.269 align:start position:0%
is this going to solve all our housing
problems

00:14:59.269 --> 00:14:59.279 align:start position:0%
problems
 
00:15:02.069 --> 00:15:02.079 align:start position:0%
no but it does give us
 
00:15:03.670 --> 00:15:03.680 align:start position:0%
another tool
 
00:15:05.030 --> 00:15:05.040 align:start position:0%
to use
 
00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:05.990 align:start position:0%
to use
now

00:15:05.990 --> 00:15:06.000 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:15:08.069 --> 00:15:08.079 align:start position:0%
i know the big question is
 
00:15:09.829 --> 00:15:09.839 align:start position:0%
you know we don't like telling towns
 
00:15:12.150 --> 00:15:12.160 align:start position:0%
what they have to do
 
00:15:15.829 --> 00:15:15.839 align:start position:0%
sometimes there is a reason
 
00:15:18.550 --> 00:15:18.560 align:start position:0%
to support preemptive zoning
 
00:15:21.430 --> 00:15:21.440 align:start position:0%
we have preemptive we have pre-emptive
 
00:15:24.829 --> 00:15:24.839 align:start position:0%
state rules about wastewater water
 
00:15:27.670 --> 00:15:27.680 align:start position:0%
quality protection of shorelands and
 
00:15:28.949 --> 00:15:28.959 align:start position:0%
lake fronts
 
00:15:31.990 --> 00:15:32.000 align:start position:0%
we have all of those rules
 
00:15:36.230 --> 00:15:36.240 align:start position:0%
we have statewide rules about car safety
 
00:15:38.949 --> 00:15:38.959 align:start position:0%
i would submit that given
 
00:15:41.430 --> 00:15:41.440 align:start position:0%
our situation and this is true across
 
00:15:43.829 --> 00:15:43.839 align:start position:0%
the united states our situation
 
00:15:45.670 --> 00:15:45.680 align:start position:0%
vis-a-vis housing
 
00:15:47.749 --> 00:15:47.759 align:start position:0%
it's time for the state to say hey we
 
00:15:49.829 --> 00:15:49.839 align:start position:0%
need to do something about this
 
00:15:51.590 --> 00:15:51.600 align:start position:0%
if we leave it up to the individual
 
00:15:55.030 --> 00:15:55.040 align:start position:0%
towns there's absolutely no incentive
 
00:15:57.590 --> 00:15:57.600 align:start position:0%
for any one town
 
00:16:00.949 --> 00:16:00.959 align:start position:0%
to do this because
 
00:16:02.870 --> 00:16:02.880 align:start position:0%
it's too hard
 
00:16:05.749 --> 00:16:05.759 align:start position:0%
one town at a time the response is going
 
00:16:07.509 --> 00:16:07.519 align:start position:0%
to be well why should we allow this
 
00:16:09.350 --> 00:16:09.360 align:start position:0%
those people over in that town over
 
00:16:11.189 --> 00:16:11.199 align:start position:0%
there they don't allow it why should we
 
00:16:13.350 --> 00:16:13.360 align:start position:0%
do it why is it so important for us to
 
00:16:14.470 --> 00:16:14.480 align:start position:0%
do it
 
00:16:17.749 --> 00:16:17.759 align:start position:0%
we've tried hard over the last 20 years
 
00:16:19.030 --> 00:16:19.040 align:start position:0%
to do this
 
00:16:22.629 --> 00:16:22.639 align:start position:0%
one town at a time and we have been
 
00:16:25.710 --> 00:16:25.720 align:start position:0%
remarkably unsuccessful
 
00:16:29.030 --> 00:16:29.040 align:start position:0%
1177 merely says okay
 
00:16:30.629 --> 00:16:30.639 align:start position:0%
you need to allow
 
00:16:33.430 --> 00:16:33.440 align:start position:0%
house-sized buildings with up to four
 
00:16:37.269 --> 00:16:37.279 align:start position:0%
units in places that already exist with
 
00:16:41.110 --> 00:16:41.120 align:start position:0%
water and sewer and roads it's another
 
00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:42.389 align:start position:0%
water and sewer and roads it's another
tool

00:16:42.389 --> 00:16:42.399 align:start position:0%
tool
 
00:16:44.949 --> 00:16:44.959 align:start position:0%
in an effort to get
 
00:16:47.030 --> 00:16:47.040 align:start position:0%
more housing in new hampshire
 
00:16:49.189 --> 00:16:49.199 align:start position:0%
the other advantage of a fourplex or a
 
00:16:51.749 --> 00:16:51.759 align:start position:0%
triple or a duplex is they're much more
 
00:16:54.710 --> 00:16:54.720 align:start position:0%
likely to be owner-occupied
 
00:16:57.509 --> 00:16:57.519 align:start position:0%
it's a size that doesn't appeal to big
 
00:17:00.150 --> 00:17:00.160 align:start position:0%
developers there's not enough juice for
 
00:17:01.670 --> 00:17:01.680 align:start position:0%
the squeeze
 
00:17:03.910 --> 00:17:03.920 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a size that appeals to
 
00:17:06.710 --> 00:17:06.720 align:start position:0%
people who want to work in their own
 
00:17:09.510 --> 00:17:09.520 align:start position:0%
town or the next town over two women in
 
00:17:12.309 --> 00:17:12.319 align:start position:0%
a pickup truck can build a four-plex
 
00:17:14.949 --> 00:17:14.959 align:start position:0%
a little old lady can convert her house
 
00:17:17.029 --> 00:17:17.039 align:start position:0%
to three units
 
00:17:18.949 --> 00:17:18.959 align:start position:0%
this is a thing that empowers
 
00:17:18.959 --> 00:17:20.870 align:start position:0%
this is a thing that empowers
individuals

00:17:20.870 --> 00:17:20.880 align:start position:0%
individuals
 
00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:22.230 align:start position:0%
individuals
and

00:17:22.230 --> 00:17:22.240 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:17:22.240 --> 00:17:23.669 align:start position:0%
and
creates

00:17:23.669 --> 00:17:23.679 align:start position:0%
creates
 
00:17:26.630 --> 00:17:26.640 align:start position:0%
better outcomes for everyone this is a
 
00:17:27.909 --> 00:17:27.919 align:start position:0%
bill for
 
00:17:30.230 --> 00:17:30.240 align:start position:0%
businesses who are looking for housing
 
00:17:32.789 --> 00:17:32.799 align:start position:0%
for their workers this is a bill for
 
00:17:34.870 --> 00:17:34.880 align:start position:0%
people who are living in a house that's
 
00:17:36.549 --> 00:17:36.559 align:start position:0%
too big for them
 
00:17:39.830 --> 00:17:39.840 align:start position:0%
this is a bill for people who want to
 
00:17:42.549 --> 00:17:42.559 align:start position:0%
create a little property that they can
 
00:17:43.830 --> 00:17:43.840 align:start position:0%
rent out
 
00:17:47.430 --> 00:17:47.440 align:start position:0%
part of and live in the other half of
 
00:17:49.590 --> 00:17:49.600 align:start position:0%
this is a bill that works for a lot of
 
00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:51.110 align:start position:0%
this is a bill that works for a lot of
people

00:17:51.110 --> 00:17:51.120 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:17:52.710 --> 00:17:52.720 align:start position:0%
and as i said
 
00:17:55.270 --> 00:17:55.280 align:start position:0%
these buildings already exist
 
00:17:57.110 --> 00:17:57.120 align:start position:0%
in every place in new hampshire i was
 
00:17:59.270 --> 00:17:59.280 align:start position:0%
driving through richmond the other day
 
00:18:01.909 --> 00:18:01.919 align:start position:0%
richmond population i think a thousand
 
00:18:03.830 --> 00:18:03.840 align:start position:0%
there's a fourplex right on the corner
 
00:18:05.350 --> 00:18:05.360 align:start position:0%
in richmond i stopped to take a picture
 
00:18:06.870 --> 00:18:06.880 align:start position:0%
because i always do
 
00:18:09.029 --> 00:18:09.039 align:start position:0%
but they're everywhere and often you
 
00:18:10.950 --> 00:18:10.960 align:start position:0%
can't even tell it's a multi-family
 
00:18:13.029 --> 00:18:13.039 align:start position:0%
until you go around to the side and
 
00:18:15.270 --> 00:18:15.280 align:start position:0%
count the electric meters
 
00:18:17.270 --> 00:18:17.280 align:start position:0%
that's how you tell
 
00:18:20.990 --> 00:18:21.000 align:start position:0%
so in conclusion i ask you to support hp
 
00:18:24.470 --> 00:18:24.480 align:start position:0%
1177 of fourplex is a house
 
00:18:31.430 --> 00:18:31.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:32.789 --> 00:18:32.799 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
00:18:37.430 --> 00:18:37.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:39.669 --> 00:18:39.679 align:start position:0%
is this bill
 
00:18:44.230 --> 00:18:44.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:45.750 --> 00:18:45.760 align:start position:0%
i suppose that some of them would be
 
00:18:47.669 --> 00:18:47.679 align:start position:0%
rentals yes
 
00:18:49.669 --> 00:18:49.679 align:start position:0%
follow up please
 
00:18:50.950 --> 00:18:50.960 align:start position:0%
well if it's
 
00:18:53.190 --> 00:18:53.200 align:start position:0%
individually owned
 
00:18:55.110 --> 00:18:55.120 align:start position:0%
does is that going to require
 
00:18:57.110 --> 00:18:57.120 align:start position:0%
subdivision of the lot
 
00:19:00.150 --> 00:19:00.160 align:start position:0%
no because what this says is if that
 
00:19:02.070 --> 00:19:02.080 align:start position:0%
would be a condo and that's a different
 
00:19:04.630 --> 00:19:04.640 align:start position:0%
animal altogether and those have to
 
00:19:06.710 --> 00:19:06.720 align:start position:0%
abide by the condo rules what this says
 
00:19:09.510 --> 00:19:09.520 align:start position:0%
is that if you have
 
00:19:13.110 --> 00:19:13.120 align:start position:0%
a lot an existing lot and you can under
 
00:19:14.870 --> 00:19:14.880 align:start position:0%
the constraints of whatever your local
 
00:19:16.150 --> 00:19:16.160 align:start position:0%
zoning is
 
00:19:18.150 --> 00:19:18.160 align:start position:0%
build a building or two buildings or
 
00:19:20.150 --> 00:19:20.160 align:start position:0%
four little tiny buildings
 
00:19:22.710 --> 00:19:22.720 align:start position:0%
that meet those constraints you can put
 
00:19:26.150 --> 00:19:26.160 align:start position:0%
you can put that on that lot
 
00:19:28.549 --> 00:19:28.559 align:start position:0%
does that help
 
00:19:30.630 --> 00:19:30.640 align:start position:0%
follow please
 
00:19:33.029 --> 00:19:33.039 align:start position:0%
so these would be individually owned
 
00:19:33.039 --> 00:19:34.310 align:start position:0%
so these would be individually owned
properties

00:19:34.310 --> 00:19:34.320 align:start position:0%
properties
 
00:19:37.990 --> 00:19:38.000 align:start position:0%
or dwellings on a single lot
 
00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:39.029 align:start position:0%
or dwellings on a single lot
no

00:19:39.029 --> 00:19:39.039 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:19:41.350 --> 00:19:41.360 align:start position:0%
my guess is no because that would
 
00:19:43.190 --> 00:19:43.200 align:start position:0%
require subdivision and then you have to
 
00:19:44.950 --> 00:19:44.960 align:start position:0%
abide by your subdivision rules what
 
00:19:47.909 --> 00:19:47.919 align:start position:0%
this does is if i have a big house
 
00:19:49.669 --> 00:19:49.679 align:start position:0%
that's too big for me
 
00:19:51.830 --> 00:19:51.840 align:start position:0%
right now in the town i live in if i
 
00:19:54.390 --> 00:19:54.400 align:start position:0%
wanted to make a duplex my house suppose
 
00:19:56.789 --> 00:19:56.799 align:start position:0%
suppose my house were on a half an acre
 
00:19:58.870 --> 00:19:58.880 align:start position:0%
in my town in order to turn that house
 
00:20:01.270 --> 00:20:01.280 align:start position:0%
into a duplex i would have to have a
 
00:20:04.470 --> 00:20:04.480 align:start position:0%
whole acre of land what this bill says
 
00:20:04.480 --> 00:20:05.270 align:start position:0%
whole acre of land what this bill says
is

00:20:05.270 --> 00:20:05.280 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:20:08.470 --> 00:20:08.480 align:start position:0%
no you can make a duplex out of that
 
00:20:10.630 --> 00:20:10.640 align:start position:0%
building or you can make a three or a
 
00:20:13.909 --> 00:20:13.919 align:start position:0%
four if you abide by the setbacks lot
 
00:20:16.470 --> 00:20:16.480 align:start position:0%
coverage and parking required in your
 
00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:32.549 align:start position:0%
coverage and parking required in your
town

00:20:32.549 --> 00:20:32.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:33.990 --> 00:20:34.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you
 
00:20:36.950 --> 00:20:36.960 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
 
00:20:36.960 --> 00:20:37.830 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
um

00:20:37.830 --> 00:20:37.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:41.350 --> 00:20:41.360 align:start position:0%
would you believe that this also answers
 
00:20:41.360 --> 00:20:42.310 align:start position:0%
would you believe that this also answers
uh

00:20:42.310 --> 00:20:42.320 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:20:44.390 --> 00:20:44.400 align:start position:0%
some of the needs like for example in
 
00:20:45.669 --> 00:20:45.679 align:start position:0%
our case
 
00:20:48.630 --> 00:20:48.640 align:start position:0%
we looked at downsizing we have a larger
 
00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:49.590 align:start position:0%
we looked at downsizing we have a larger
home

00:20:49.590 --> 00:20:49.600 align:start position:0%
home
 
00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:50.470 align:start position:0%
home
and

00:20:50.470 --> 00:20:50.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:20:52.950 --> 00:20:52.960 align:start position:0%
we wanted to downsize and i wanted to
 
00:20:55.029 --> 00:20:55.039 align:start position:0%
stay in our own ward
 
00:20:58.149 --> 00:20:58.159 align:start position:0%
if in order for us to downsize get
 
00:21:00.950 --> 00:21:00.960 align:start position:0%
something smaller i almost have to pay
 
00:21:04.230 --> 00:21:04.240 align:start position:0%
the same amount that my house is worth
 
00:21:06.149 --> 00:21:06.159 align:start position:0%
so it didn't make any sense to go
 
00:21:10.390 --> 00:21:10.400 align:start position:0%
smaller and lose the equity that we have
 
00:21:13.190 --> 00:21:13.200 align:start position:0%
and we do have opportunity to do at
 
00:21:14.789 --> 00:21:14.799 align:start position:0%
least two
 
00:21:16.950 --> 00:21:16.960 align:start position:0%
you know like they would create in my
 
00:21:19.110 --> 00:21:19.120 align:start position:0%
neighborhood they have created uh in la
 
00:21:19.120 --> 00:21:20.390 align:start position:0%
neighborhood they have created uh in la
apartments

00:21:20.390 --> 00:21:20.400 align:start position:0%
apartments
 
00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:21.590 align:start position:0%
apartments
yeah

00:21:21.590 --> 00:21:21.600 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:23.430 align:start position:0%
yeah
yes

00:21:23.430 --> 00:21:23.440 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:21:26.070 --> 00:21:26.080 align:start position:0%
she did she asked me
 
00:21:29.669 --> 00:21:29.679 align:start position:0%
i do believe that i will say that as
 
00:21:32.390 --> 00:21:32.400 align:start position:0%
probably all of you know i did exactly
 
00:21:35.270 --> 00:21:35.280 align:start position:0%
that in my house i put my roof where my
 
00:21:37.909 --> 00:21:37.919 align:start position:0%
mouth was i created three units out of
 
00:21:40.310 --> 00:21:40.320 align:start position:0%
what had been one enormous dumb
 
00:21:43.510 --> 00:21:43.520 align:start position:0%
victorian so yes and one of the things
 
00:21:45.750 --> 00:21:45.760 align:start position:0%
that i'd like to add to that is because
 
00:21:49.110 --> 00:21:49.120 align:start position:0%
these tend to be small things they are
 
00:21:51.430 --> 00:21:51.440 align:start position:0%
often owner occupied
 
00:21:51.440 --> 00:21:52.470 align:start position:0%
often owner occupied
which

00:21:52.470 --> 00:21:52.480 align:start position:0%
which
 
00:21:55.270 --> 00:21:55.280 align:start position:0%
we don't require owner occupancy
 
00:21:56.870 --> 00:21:56.880 align:start position:0%
and we shouldn't
 
00:21:59.110 --> 00:21:59.120 align:start position:0%
there's no legal justification for it
 
00:22:01.990 --> 00:22:02.000 align:start position:0%
but i know that people feel better
 
00:22:05.430 --> 00:22:05.440 align:start position:0%
about knowing that their landlord is
 
00:22:07.110 --> 00:22:07.120 align:start position:0%
right there
 
00:22:10.390 --> 00:22:10.400 align:start position:0%
follow-up mr chair yeah so what this my
 
00:22:12.470 --> 00:22:12.480 align:start position:0%
requirement is like you know i get a
 
00:22:15.110 --> 00:22:15.120 align:start position:0%
call all the time to host a
 
00:22:17.590 --> 00:22:17.600 align:start position:0%
student or you know in the past we have
 
00:22:19.190 --> 00:22:19.200 align:start position:0%
done that if they were part of my
 
00:22:21.510 --> 00:22:21.520 align:start position:0%
household that became too much
 
00:22:24.630 --> 00:22:24.640 align:start position:0%
so now to create an independent small
 
00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:26.870 align:start position:0%
so now to create an independent small
unit

00:22:26.870 --> 00:22:26.880 align:start position:0%
unit
 
00:22:30.070 --> 00:22:30.080 align:start position:0%
helps not only helps us knowing that we
 
00:22:33.669 --> 00:22:33.679 align:start position:0%
are supporting somebody and also helps
 
00:22:37.270 --> 00:22:37.280 align:start position:0%
us stay in our own home rent it out
 
00:22:40.549 --> 00:22:40.559 align:start position:0%
not an exorbitant but at least to pay
 
00:22:40.559 --> 00:22:41.510 align:start position:0%
not an exorbitant but at least to pay
for

00:22:41.510 --> 00:22:41.520 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:22:43.909 --> 00:22:43.919 align:start position:0%
some of the utilities
 
00:22:46.549 --> 00:22:46.559 align:start position:0%
so that's a win-win
 
00:22:49.110 --> 00:22:49.120 align:start position:0%
i think it is yes thank you so would you
 
00:22:51.510 --> 00:22:51.520 align:start position:0%
believe that it would be a great
 
00:22:51.520 --> 00:22:52.630 align:start position:0%
believe that it would be a great
addition

00:22:52.630 --> 00:22:52.640 align:start position:0%
addition
 
00:22:55.750 --> 00:22:55.760 align:start position:0%
i do believe that and and it's a great
 
00:22:58.230 --> 00:22:58.240 align:start position:0%
addition as i said in my testimony for
 
00:23:01.510 --> 00:23:01.520 align:start position:0%
all kinds of people i mean we just we
 
00:23:04.390 --> 00:23:04.400 align:start position:0%
need housing we need housing choices and
 
00:23:06.630 --> 00:23:06.640 align:start position:0%
this by the way does not preclude you
 
00:23:09.029 --> 00:23:09.039 align:start position:0%
from building a single family house
 
00:23:11.350 --> 00:23:11.360 align:start position:0%
it's not the end of single family houses
 
00:23:13.909 --> 00:23:13.919 align:start position:0%
you can build a single family house
 
00:23:17.029 --> 00:23:17.039 align:start position:0%
you just have other choices available to
 
00:23:17.039 --> 00:23:20.950 align:start position:0%
you just have other choices available to
you

00:23:20.950 --> 00:23:20.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:22.950 --> 00:23:22.960 align:start position:0%
thank you uh mr chairman and i promise
 
00:23:26.950 --> 00:23:26.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:29.270 --> 00:23:29.280 align:start position:0%
um i i do have two questions uh mr
 
00:23:31.270 --> 00:23:31.280 align:start position:0%
chairman but uh the first one you've
 
00:23:33.270 --> 00:23:33.280 align:start position:0%
kind of answered it already you said it
 
00:23:36.070 --> 00:23:36.080 align:start position:0%
does there's no owner owned requirement
 
00:23:38.549 --> 00:23:38.559 align:start position:0%
but adus have an owner-owned requirement
 
00:23:41.029 --> 00:23:41.039 align:start position:0%
this is different in which way thank you
 
00:23:43.990 --> 00:23:44.000 align:start position:0%
adus when we drafted the adu ordinance
 
00:23:46.149 --> 00:23:46.159 align:start position:0%
one of the things that is in the adu
 
00:23:48.710 --> 00:23:48.720 align:start position:0%
statute says that local jurisdictions
 
00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:49.750 align:start position:0%
statute says that local jurisdictions
may

00:23:49.750 --> 00:23:49.760 align:start position:0%
may
 
00:23:52.070 --> 00:23:52.080 align:start position:0%
they don't have to but they may require
 
00:23:54.870 --> 00:23:54.880 align:start position:0%
owner occupancy for an adu this does not
 
00:23:57.269 --> 00:23:57.279 align:start position:0%
have any such requirement
 
00:23:59.430 --> 00:23:59.440 align:start position:0%
and just one other question mr chairman
 
00:24:00.630 --> 00:24:00.640 align:start position:0%
thank you so much
 
00:24:03.190 --> 00:24:03.200 align:start position:0%
my other question is
 
00:24:05.990 --> 00:24:06.000 align:start position:0%
anytime we consider
 
00:24:08.149 --> 00:24:08.159 align:start position:0%
multi-units of five or more we always
 
00:24:10.470 --> 00:24:10.480 align:start position:0%
think of them as commercial and
 
00:24:13.430 --> 00:24:13.440 align:start position:0%
um in apartment type of styles this
 
00:24:15.830 --> 00:24:15.840 align:start position:0%
falls below that but one of the nice
 
00:24:18.230 --> 00:24:18.240 align:start position:0%
things about that other thing is that we
 
00:24:20.870 --> 00:24:20.880 align:start position:0%
have the ability of code enforcement
 
00:24:22.870 --> 00:24:22.880 align:start position:0%
um because a
 
00:24:24.230 --> 00:24:24.240 align:start position:0%
private home
 
00:24:25.909 --> 00:24:25.919 align:start position:0%
has different code enforcements actually
 
00:24:25.919 --> 00:24:26.710 align:start position:0%
has different code enforcements actually
none

00:24:26.710 --> 00:24:26.720 align:start position:0%
none
 
00:24:29.190 --> 00:24:29.200 align:start position:0%
versus a apartment type conflict so how
 
00:24:31.510 --> 00:24:31.520 align:start position:0%
does the code enforcement
 
00:24:33.909 --> 00:24:33.919 align:start position:0%
for these where they're not commercial
 
00:24:35.190 --> 00:24:35.200 align:start position:0%
work differently
 
00:24:37.669 --> 00:24:37.679 align:start position:0%
well in terms of the building code more
 
00:24:39.430 --> 00:24:39.440 align:start position:0%
than two units
 
00:24:41.269 --> 00:24:41.279 align:start position:0%
falls under the international building
 
00:24:43.190 --> 00:24:43.200 align:start position:0%
code which is the the code that's used
 
00:24:45.990 --> 00:24:46.000 align:start position:0%
for commercial buildings to or below are
 
00:24:47.669 --> 00:24:47.679 align:start position:0%
in the residential code
 
00:24:49.830 --> 00:24:49.840 align:start position:0%
so depending on whether it's two three
 
00:24:52.390 --> 00:24:52.400 align:start position:0%
or four your local code enforcement
 
00:24:54.789 --> 00:24:54.799 align:start position:0%
officer uses the code
 
00:24:54.799 --> 00:24:55.830 align:start position:0%
officer uses the code
for

00:24:55.830 --> 00:24:55.840 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:24:58.310 --> 00:24:58.320 align:start position:0%
that type of building so a duplex they
 
00:24:59.909 --> 00:24:59.919 align:start position:0%
use the international residential code
 
00:25:02.470 --> 00:25:02.480 align:start position:0%
which governs things like how tall your
 
00:25:05.110 --> 00:25:05.120 align:start position:0%
stair risers have to be
 
00:25:05.120 --> 00:25:06.310 align:start position:0%
stair risers have to be
and

00:25:06.310 --> 00:25:06.320 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:25:08.950 --> 00:25:08.960 align:start position:0%
anything above three or above requires
 
00:25:11.269 --> 00:25:11.279 align:start position:0%
sprinkling in the state of new hampshire
 
00:25:13.190 --> 00:25:13.200 align:start position:0%
that's part of the ibc the international
 
00:25:15.350 --> 00:25:15.360 align:start position:0%
building code in new hampshire so there
 
00:25:18.549 --> 00:25:18.559 align:start position:0%
are still all the all the relevant fire
 
00:25:20.950 --> 00:25:20.960 align:start position:0%
and safety and building construction
 
00:25:23.029 --> 00:25:23.039 align:start position:0%
rules apply
 
00:25:24.390 --> 00:25:24.400 align:start position:0%
can i just ask for one quick
 
00:25:26.549 --> 00:25:26.559 align:start position:0%
clarification sir thank you
 
00:25:28.789 --> 00:25:28.799 align:start position:0%
thank you and and i'm just glad to hear
 
00:25:30.950 --> 00:25:30.960 align:start position:0%
that that the the question would be more
 
00:25:33.510 --> 00:25:33.520 align:start position:0%
like um for instance now
 
00:25:36.470 --> 00:25:36.480 align:start position:0%
in nashua if someone had um
 
00:25:38.310 --> 00:25:38.320 align:start position:0%
bed bugs or uh uh
 
00:25:40.549 --> 00:25:40.559 align:start position:0%
a a window that wasn't opening properly
 
00:25:43.110 --> 00:25:43.120 align:start position:0%
they can call code and they come and
 
00:25:44.470 --> 00:25:44.480 align:start position:0%
check it because it's commercial would
 
00:25:46.390 --> 00:25:46.400 align:start position:0%
that still apply to this i think that's
 
00:25:48.390 --> 00:25:48.400 align:start position:0%
a local control issue i think that you
 
00:25:51.190 --> 00:25:51.200 align:start position:0%
could you can add that to if you want to
 
00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:51.990 align:start position:0%
could you can add that to if you want to
say

00:25:51.990 --> 00:25:52.000 align:start position:0%
say
 
00:25:54.310 --> 00:25:54.320 align:start position:0%
you know three and above now falls under
 
00:25:56.630 --> 00:25:56.640 align:start position:0%
that that would be up to you locally
 
00:25:58.789 --> 00:25:58.799 align:start position:0%
this bill does not address that my
 
00:26:00.470 --> 00:26:00.480 align:start position:0%
assumption is that that would fall under
 
00:26:02.789 --> 00:26:02.799 align:start position:0%
health and safety just like any place
 
00:26:05.029 --> 00:26:05.039 align:start position:0%
else i mean for example if i remodel a
 
00:26:07.669 --> 00:26:07.679 align:start position:0%
single family home and i have a bedroom
 
00:26:09.510 --> 00:26:09.520 align:start position:0%
and i rent it out and it turns out that
 
00:26:11.669 --> 00:26:11.679 align:start position:0%
one of the windows is not big enough for
 
00:26:13.510 --> 00:26:13.520 align:start position:0%
an egress window
 
00:26:15.909 --> 00:26:15.919 align:start position:0%
that's an issue that can be dealt with
 
00:26:22.630 --> 00:26:22.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:24.230 --> 00:26:24.240 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
00:26:26.390 --> 00:26:26.400 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
 
00:26:28.950 --> 00:26:28.960 align:start position:0%
um in my community of merrimack we have
 
00:26:31.350 --> 00:26:31.360 align:start position:0%
many single-family homes
 
00:26:33.830 --> 00:26:33.840 align:start position:0%
that have in-law apartments
 
00:26:33.840 --> 00:26:34.630 align:start position:0%
that have in-law apartments
um

00:26:34.630 --> 00:26:34.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:36.310 --> 00:26:36.320 align:start position:0%
you really can't tell unless you know
 
00:26:38.390 --> 00:26:38.400 align:start position:0%
the person's there
 
00:26:39.909 --> 00:26:39.919 align:start position:0%
how how does this fit in would that
 
00:26:41.990 --> 00:26:42.000 align:start position:0%
allow in-law apartments to be
 
00:26:44.390 --> 00:26:44.400 align:start position:0%
you know rented by other people or
 
00:26:45.909 --> 00:26:45.919 align:start position:0%
because right now i think i don't know
 
00:26:48.470 --> 00:26:48.480 align:start position:0%
if it's a state law or an ordinance but
 
00:26:52.230 --> 00:26:52.240 align:start position:0%
only family can use an in-law apartment
 
00:26:52.240 --> 00:26:53.669 align:start position:0%
only family can use an in-law apartment
right

00:26:53.669 --> 00:26:53.679 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:26:56.230 --> 00:26:56.240 align:start position:0%
what your town has done is they have
 
00:26:58.549 --> 00:26:58.559 align:start position:0%
adopted an accessory dwelling unit
 
00:27:01.350 --> 00:27:01.360 align:start position:0%
ordinance that requires owner occupancy
 
00:27:03.190 --> 00:27:03.200 align:start position:0%
or family connection
 
00:27:05.510 --> 00:27:05.520 align:start position:0%
that's a choice that local jurisdictions
 
00:27:06.630 --> 00:27:06.640 align:start position:0%
can make
 
00:27:09.909 --> 00:27:09.919 align:start position:0%
if you build if you make it a duplex
 
00:27:13.190 --> 00:27:13.200 align:start position:0%
then the adu ordinances don't require so
 
00:27:16.789 --> 00:27:16.799 align:start position:0%
don't affect it so it depends on how the
 
00:27:19.110 --> 00:27:19.120 align:start position:0%
building owner
 
00:27:21.750 --> 00:27:21.760 align:start position:0%
goes about doing it if you
 
00:27:24.710 --> 00:27:24.720 align:start position:0%
are explicitly building an adu and you
 
00:27:26.950 --> 00:27:26.960 align:start position:0%
are asking to have an adu then you have
 
00:27:29.750 --> 00:27:29.760 align:start position:0%
to abide by the adu rules if you go down
 
00:27:31.430 --> 00:27:31.440 align:start position:0%
to the code office and you say i'd like
 
00:27:33.110 --> 00:27:33.120 align:start position:0%
to have another unit
 
00:27:35.190 --> 00:27:35.200 align:start position:0%
and they say do you want an adu or do
 
00:27:37.510 --> 00:27:37.520 align:start position:0%
you want a duplex and then you say i
 
00:27:40.070 --> 00:27:40.080 align:start position:0%
want a duplex then the duplex rules
 
00:27:42.149 --> 00:27:42.159 align:start position:0%
would apply under this under this
 
00:27:42.159 --> 00:27:43.350 align:start position:0%
would apply under this under this
statute

00:27:43.350 --> 00:27:43.360 align:start position:0%
statute
 
00:27:46.230 --> 00:27:46.240 align:start position:0%
so it's a difference of what your local
 
00:27:53.110 --> 00:27:53.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:55.590 --> 00:27:55.600 align:start position:0%
good morning representative
 
00:27:57.510 --> 00:27:57.520 align:start position:0%
i come from a community that has a
 
00:27:58.710 --> 00:27:58.720 align:start position:0%
master plan
 
00:28:00.389 --> 00:28:00.399 align:start position:0%
we've identified the number of losses
 
00:28:02.549 --> 00:28:02.559 align:start position:0%
one acre half acre and part of that
 
00:28:05.510 --> 00:28:05.520 align:start position:0%
master plan is uh
 
00:28:07.110 --> 00:28:07.120 align:start position:0%
it kind of tells us what direction we're
 
00:28:08.549 --> 00:28:08.559 align:start position:0%
going to go with our sewer and water and
 
00:28:10.149 --> 00:28:10.159 align:start position:0%
development things like that so we know
 
00:28:11.909 --> 00:28:11.919 align:start position:0%
we've got 10 one acre lots gonna have
 
00:28:13.269 --> 00:28:13.279 align:start position:0%
ten houses
 
00:28:15.430 --> 00:28:15.440 align:start position:0%
now if your bill passed
 
00:28:17.990 --> 00:28:18.000 align:start position:0%
we could potentially have 40 houses or
 
00:28:20.950 --> 00:28:20.960 align:start position:0%
40 residents on those 10 acre lots
 
00:28:22.070 --> 00:28:22.080 align:start position:0%
which should be
 
00:28:23.830 --> 00:28:23.840 align:start position:0%
kind of pushing our sewer system where
 
00:28:26.549 --> 00:28:26.559 align:start position:0%
we could have to spend 10 15 20 million
 
00:28:28.950 --> 00:28:28.960 align:start position:0%
dollars to accommodate that change
 
00:28:30.549 --> 00:28:30.559 align:start position:0%
how do you explain that that difference
 
00:28:33.029 --> 00:28:33.039 align:start position:0%
how does that work into this i guess
 
00:28:33.039 --> 00:28:33.909 align:start position:0%
how does that work into this i guess
so

00:28:33.909 --> 00:28:33.919 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:28:37.190 --> 00:28:37.200 align:start position:0%
uh you can't do this unless you have
 
00:28:39.590 --> 00:28:39.600 align:start position:0%
municipal water and sewer so if there's
 
00:28:41.750 --> 00:28:41.760 align:start position:0%
not municipal water and sewer to those
 
00:28:43.269 --> 00:28:43.279 align:start position:0%
lots now
 
00:28:45.269 --> 00:28:45.279 align:start position:0%
or the developer is not willing to
 
00:28:46.950 --> 00:28:46.960 align:start position:0%
extend it
 
00:28:49.990 --> 00:28:50.000 align:start position:0%
and and the town agrees that they have
 
00:28:53.029 --> 00:28:53.039 align:start position:0%
capacity then they can't do it so
 
00:28:56.310 --> 00:28:56.320 align:start position:0%
primarily this is intended as infill
 
00:28:59.110 --> 00:28:59.120 align:start position:0%
rather than as sprawling out into the
 
00:28:59.120 --> 00:29:01.750 align:start position:0%
rather than as sprawling out into the
countryside

00:29:01.750 --> 00:29:01.760 align:start position:0%
countryside
 
00:29:01.760 --> 00:29:02.950 align:start position:0%
countryside
so

00:29:02.950 --> 00:29:02.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:29:05.750 --> 00:29:05.760 align:start position:0%
you could as a town if your sewer and
 
00:29:07.669 --> 00:29:07.679 align:start position:0%
water is pressed
 
00:29:10.310 --> 00:29:10.320 align:start position:0%
you can say we can't approve these 40
 
00:29:11.750 --> 00:29:11.760 align:start position:0%
new units
 
00:29:14.710 --> 00:29:14.720 align:start position:0%
because it is premature we don't have
 
00:29:16.870 --> 00:29:16.880 align:start position:0%
the sewer capacity
 
00:29:19.669 --> 00:29:19.679 align:start position:0%
as i said this bill is intended to
 
00:29:23.029 --> 00:29:23.039 align:start position:0%
address already existing lots served by
 
00:29:26.870 --> 00:29:26.880 align:start position:0%
already existing water and sewer
 
00:29:29.190 --> 00:29:29.200 align:start position:0%
representative melvin
 
00:29:30.470 --> 00:29:30.480 align:start position:0%
thank you for
 
00:29:32.470 --> 00:29:32.480 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for taking my question
 
00:29:32.480 --> 00:29:33.590 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for taking my question
uh

00:29:33.590 --> 00:29:33.600 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:29:35.350 --> 00:29:35.360 align:start position:0%
you've got an old victorian and you're
 
00:29:37.510 --> 00:29:37.520 align:start position:0%
going to turn it into a four unit
 
00:29:37.520 --> 00:29:38.630 align:start position:0%
going to turn it into a four unit
structure

00:29:38.630 --> 00:29:38.640 align:start position:0%
structure
 
00:29:41.909 --> 00:29:41.919 align:start position:0%
uh it have to be ada and have elevators
 
00:29:41.919 --> 00:29:42.870 align:start position:0%
uh it have to be ada and have elevators
no

00:29:42.870 --> 00:29:42.880 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:29:44.870 --> 00:29:44.880 align:start position:0%
ada is a civil law
 
00:29:46.230 --> 00:29:46.240 align:start position:0%
um and
 
00:29:49.590 --> 00:29:49.600 align:start position:0%
you if you build a new building of i
 
00:29:52.549 --> 00:29:52.559 align:start position:0%
think it's five or more
 
00:29:54.710 --> 00:29:54.720 align:start position:0%
one of the ground floor units has to be
 
00:29:57.510 --> 00:29:57.520 align:start position:0%
ada accessible
 
00:29:59.909 --> 00:29:59.919 align:start position:0%
but this oh sorry
 
00:30:01.990 --> 00:30:02.000 align:start position:0%
this law does not address that i mean
 
00:30:03.430 --> 00:30:03.440 align:start position:0%
you don't have to put in elevators you
 
00:30:05.430 --> 00:30:05.440 align:start position:0%
have to put in um you have to have
 
00:30:07.830 --> 00:30:07.840 align:start position:0%
egress um you have to have an egress
 
00:30:09.430 --> 00:30:09.440 align:start position:0%
path that's less than i think it's less
 
00:30:12.230 --> 00:30:12.240 align:start position:0%
than 100 feet door your front door to
 
00:30:14.789 --> 00:30:14.799 align:start position:0%
the outside uh you have to have egress
 
00:30:17.350 --> 00:30:17.360 align:start position:0%
windows if it's more than two units it
 
00:30:19.350 --> 00:30:19.360 align:start position:0%
has to be sprinkled
 
00:30:21.510 --> 00:30:21.520 align:start position:0%
all of those fire and safety rules still
 
00:30:21.520 --> 00:30:22.470 align:start position:0%
all of those fire and safety rules still
apply

00:30:22.470 --> 00:30:22.480 align:start position:0%
apply
 
00:30:25.510 --> 00:30:25.520 align:start position:0%
but the ada rule is slightly different
 
00:30:27.510 --> 00:30:27.520 align:start position:0%
because it's civil
 
00:30:30.389 --> 00:30:30.399 align:start position:0%
it's that's under the fair housing act
 
00:30:34.830 --> 00:30:34.840 align:start position:0%
and would not apply in this case in most
 
00:30:39.029 --> 00:30:39.039 align:start position:0%
instances representative guthrie
 
00:30:40.789 --> 00:30:40.799 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
00:30:42.470 --> 00:30:42.480 align:start position:0%
presenting the bill
 
00:30:44.789 --> 00:30:44.799 align:start position:0%
uh representative van
 
00:30:47.269 --> 00:30:47.279 align:start position:0%
it just seems to be limited can you tell
 
00:30:48.789 --> 00:30:48.799 align:start position:0%
me how many
 
00:30:51.990 --> 00:30:52.000 align:start position:0%
uh cities and towns this would impact on
 
00:30:53.750 --> 00:30:53.760 align:start position:0%
because like seems to me that we have an
 
00:30:56.230 --> 00:30:56.240 align:start position:0%
awful lot of communities that don't that
 
00:30:59.509 --> 00:30:59.519 align:start position:0%
have water but don't have sewer yes that
 
00:31:02.070 --> 00:31:02.080 align:start position:0%
is absolutely true it is limited to
 
00:31:04.070 --> 00:31:04.080 align:start position:0%
places that have water and sewer and
 
00:31:06.230 --> 00:31:06.240 align:start position:0%
it's limited even in places that have
 
00:31:09.110 --> 00:31:09.120 align:start position:0%
water and sewer usually only have it in
 
00:31:11.830 --> 00:31:11.840 align:start position:0%
their village center so yeah this is
 
00:31:13.669 --> 00:31:13.679 align:start position:0%
very much a bill that's limited to
 
00:31:16.830 --> 00:31:16.840 align:start position:0%
places where that exists thank you thank
 
00:31:19.350 --> 00:31:19.360 align:start position:0%
you president another follow-up
 
00:31:19.360 --> 00:31:20.630 align:start position:0%
you president another follow-up
yes

00:31:20.630 --> 00:31:20.640 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:31:21.909 --> 00:31:21.919 align:start position:0%
thank you for uh
 
00:31:25.669 --> 00:31:25.679 align:start position:0%
allowing me i have a question about uh
 
00:31:28.950 --> 00:31:28.960 align:start position:0%
the uh line four of the
 
00:31:30.870 --> 00:31:30.880 align:start position:0%
bill it says
 
00:31:34.230 --> 00:31:34.240 align:start position:0%
to uh in which there are unin located
 
00:31:37.590 --> 00:31:37.600 align:start position:0%
unincorporated towns or un organized
 
00:31:37.600 --> 00:31:39.269 align:start position:0%
unincorporated towns or un organized
places

00:31:39.269 --> 00:31:39.279 align:start position:0%
places
 
00:31:39.279 --> 00:31:40.870 align:start position:0%
places
so

00:31:40.870 --> 00:31:40.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:31:46.230 --> 00:31:46.240 align:start position:0%
is this maine that say like in nashua
 
00:31:48.230 --> 00:31:48.240 align:start position:0%
this bill would not apply
 
00:31:50.630 --> 00:31:50.640 align:start position:0%
no that spoiler plate that ols puts in
 
00:31:54.549 --> 00:31:54.559 align:start position:0%
that makes it cover all of the state
 
00:31:56.070 --> 00:31:56.080 align:start position:0%
that's the way the subdivision right
 
00:31:57.990 --> 00:31:58.000 align:start position:0%
this lives in the subdivision regulation
 
00:32:00.549 --> 00:32:00.559 align:start position:0%
i think and that language lives there
 
00:32:02.389 --> 00:32:02.399 align:start position:0%
everywhere so
 
00:32:04.470 --> 00:32:04.480 align:start position:0%
no it does not mean that nashua would
 
00:32:06.230 --> 00:32:06.240 align:start position:0%
not be included
 
00:32:08.630 --> 00:32:08.640 align:start position:0%
it's all jurisdic that's just their way
 
00:32:11.430 --> 00:32:11.440 align:start position:0%
of saying everywhere but as you read
 
00:32:14.149 --> 00:32:14.159 align:start position:0%
further down it only applies where
 
00:32:17.830 --> 00:32:17.840 align:start position:0%
there's municipal water and sewer
 
00:32:19.909 --> 00:32:19.919 align:start position:0%
hello please
 
00:32:23.110 --> 00:32:23.120 align:start position:0%
so this means that in nashua there are
 
00:32:25.590 --> 00:32:25.600 align:start position:0%
located unincorporated
 
00:32:29.029 --> 00:32:29.039 align:start position:0%
towns or unorganized places
 
00:32:30.070 --> 00:32:30.080 align:start position:0%
no sir
 
00:32:33.110 --> 00:32:33.120 align:start position:0%
that is for the whole state i asked ols
 
00:32:34.549 --> 00:32:34.559 align:start position:0%
about this because i was confused and
 
00:32:36.470 --> 00:32:36.480 align:start position:0%
they said that that's the description
 
00:32:39.110 --> 00:32:39.120 align:start position:0%
for the whole state if you're writing an
 
00:32:41.269 --> 00:32:41.279 align:start position:0%
ordinary statute that affects the whole
 
00:32:43.990 --> 00:32:44.000 align:start position:0%
state under land use that's the language
 
00:32:46.549 --> 00:32:46.559 align:start position:0%
you have to use and then as you come
 
00:32:49.590 --> 00:32:49.600 align:start position:0%
down the bill or down the proposed bill
 
00:32:50.789 --> 00:32:50.799 align:start position:0%
you see
 
00:32:53.830 --> 00:32:53.840 align:start position:0%
it narrows down to only those places
 
00:32:56.470 --> 00:32:56.480 align:start position:0%
with municipal water and sewer i mean i
 
00:32:56.480 --> 00:32:58.070 align:start position:0%
with municipal water and sewer i mean i
suppose

00:32:58.070 --> 00:32:58.080 align:start position:0%
suppose
 
00:33:00.470 --> 00:33:00.480 align:start position:0%
given that language that if you were a
 
00:33:02.630 --> 00:33:02.640 align:start position:0%
billionaire you could buy
 
00:33:05.110 --> 00:33:05.120 align:start position:0%
i don't know 500 acres someplace put in
 
00:33:08.310 --> 00:33:08.320 align:start position:0%
municipal water and sewer and use this
 
00:33:11.029 --> 00:33:11.039 align:start position:0%
ordinance but existing unincorporated
 
00:33:11.039 --> 00:33:12.230 align:start position:0%
ordinance but existing unincorporated
places

00:33:12.230 --> 00:33:12.240 align:start position:0%
places
 
00:33:14.630 --> 00:33:14.640 align:start position:0%
uh would not be affected by this any
 
00:33:16.789 --> 00:33:16.799 align:start position:0%
more than big subdivisions would be
 
00:33:18.950 --> 00:33:18.960 align:start position:0%
affected by this it's places with
 
00:33:21.590 --> 00:33:21.600 align:start position:0%
municipal water and sewer
 
00:33:22.710 --> 00:33:22.720 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:33:25.669 --> 00:33:25.679 align:start position:0%
representative matcha foodie
 
00:33:28.230 --> 00:33:28.240 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair uh
 
00:33:30.310 --> 00:33:30.320 align:start position:0%
quick uh con
 
00:33:32.149 --> 00:33:32.159 align:start position:0%
quick clarification
 
00:33:34.149 --> 00:33:34.159 align:start position:0%
and you know i live in a neighborhood of
 
00:33:36.310 --> 00:33:36.320 align:start position:0%
a you know would you believe that in a
 
00:33:37.909 --> 00:33:37.919 align:start position:0%
small neighborhood like mine which is
 
00:33:42.630 --> 00:33:42.640 align:start position:0%
only 35 homes if we each even 35 homes
 
00:33:45.430 --> 00:33:45.440 align:start position:0%
which is a large half acre
 
00:33:45.440 --> 00:33:46.870 align:start position:0%
which is a large half acre
lots

00:33:46.870 --> 00:33:46.880 align:start position:0%
lots
 
00:33:49.269 --> 00:33:49.279 align:start position:0%
and about four homes have in the
 
00:33:50.789 --> 00:33:50.799 align:start position:0%
apartment already
 
00:33:53.669 --> 00:33:53.679 align:start position:0%
so even if we add because it has both
 
00:33:56.789 --> 00:33:56.799 align:start position:0%
municipal water and sewer
 
00:33:59.750 --> 00:33:59.760 align:start position:0%
and we have you know some of us have
 
00:34:01.669 --> 00:34:01.679 align:start position:0%
three parking garages
 
00:34:03.350 --> 00:34:03.360 align:start position:0%
or four
 
00:34:07.509 --> 00:34:07.519 align:start position:0%
so this would suffi without adding
 
00:34:10.310 --> 00:34:10.320 align:start position:0%
any stress on the public
 
00:34:10.320 --> 00:34:11.990 align:start position:0%
any stress on the public
utilities

00:34:11.990 --> 00:34:12.000 align:start position:0%
utilities
 
00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:13.030 align:start position:0%
utilities
correct

00:34:13.030 --> 00:34:13.040 align:start position:0%
correct
 
00:34:18.470 --> 00:34:18.480 align:start position:0%
and this would be the infill of existing
 
00:34:21.109 --> 00:34:21.119 align:start position:0%
yes this is intended for infill of
 
00:34:23.909 --> 00:34:23.919 align:start position:0%
existing neighborhoods and this is not
 
00:34:27.109 --> 00:34:27.119 align:start position:0%
going to transform us overnight i think
 
00:34:28.710 --> 00:34:28.720 align:start position:0%
one of the things that people worry
 
00:34:31.270 --> 00:34:31.280 align:start position:0%
about is that if you have an ordinance
 
00:34:33.669 --> 00:34:33.679 align:start position:0%
like this a statute that requires this
 
00:34:35.589 --> 00:34:35.599 align:start position:0%
that instantly everything is going to
 
00:34:37.909 --> 00:34:37.919 align:start position:0%
change everything's not going to change
 
00:34:39.750 --> 00:34:39.760 align:start position:0%
some people don't want to subdivide
 
00:34:41.669 --> 00:34:41.679 align:start position:0%
their house some people don't want to
 
00:34:43.750 --> 00:34:43.760 align:start position:0%
have that and they don't have to they're
 
00:34:46.829 --> 00:34:46.839 align:start position:0%
not required to it's just another
 
00:34:49.909 --> 00:34:49.919 align:start position:0%
tool one follow-up quick follow-up
 
00:34:52.550 --> 00:34:52.560 align:start position:0%
so would you also believe that this will
 
00:34:52.560 --> 00:34:53.909 align:start position:0%
so would you also believe that this will
encourage

00:34:53.909 --> 00:34:53.919 align:start position:0%
encourage
 
00:34:53.919 --> 00:34:55.669 align:start position:0%
encourage
multi-generational

00:34:55.669 --> 00:34:55.679 align:start position:0%
multi-generational
 
00:34:58.310 --> 00:34:58.320 align:start position:0%
existence without having to
 
00:35:01.030 --> 00:35:01.040 align:start position:0%
move out and aging in place it would
 
00:35:03.510 --> 00:35:03.520 align:start position:0%
allow me to age in my own home
 
00:35:05.349 --> 00:35:05.359 align:start position:0%
yes and that's an interesting thing you
 
00:35:07.510 --> 00:35:07.520 align:start position:0%
bring up it turns out that one of the
 
00:35:10.069 --> 00:35:10.079 align:start position:0%
big movers and shakers behind this kind
 
00:35:12.630 --> 00:35:12.640 align:start position:0%
of legislation which by the way includes
 
00:35:16.230 --> 00:35:16.240 align:start position:0%
agencies or organizations as diverse as
 
00:35:17.910 --> 00:35:17.920 align:start position:0%
the american association of required
 
00:35:19.910 --> 00:35:19.920 align:start position:0%
tired persons and the american
 
00:35:22.390 --> 00:35:22.400 align:start position:0%
enterprise institute all support this
 
00:35:24.470 --> 00:35:24.480 align:start position:0%
kind of legislation and the reason that
 
00:35:28.310 --> 00:35:28.320 align:start position:0%
the aarp likes it is because it does
 
00:35:31.750 --> 00:35:31.760 align:start position:0%
allow you to stay in your own place
 
00:35:33.430 --> 00:35:33.440 align:start position:0%
they've been big
 
00:35:33.440 --> 00:35:34.710 align:start position:0%
they've been big
proponents

00:35:34.710 --> 00:35:34.720 align:start position:0%
proponents
 
00:35:40.310 --> 00:35:40.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:40.320 --> 00:35:41.190 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:35:41.190 --> 00:35:41.200 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:35:43.990 --> 00:35:44.000 align:start position:0%
representative power
 
00:35:45.829 --> 00:35:45.839 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you
 
00:35:48.230 --> 00:35:48.240 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question my
 
00:35:51.270 --> 00:35:51.280 align:start position:0%
question pertains to line five where it
 
00:35:54.150 --> 00:35:54.160 align:start position:0%
states as a matter of right any single
 
00:35:55.510 --> 00:35:55.520 align:start position:0%
family lot
 
00:35:59.270 --> 00:35:59.280 align:start position:0%
focusing on any single family lot
 
00:36:02.950 --> 00:36:02.960 align:start position:0%
so if i have a single family lot of
 
00:36:05.190 --> 00:36:05.200 align:start position:0%
sufficient acreage
 
00:36:08.470 --> 00:36:08.480 align:start position:0%
under this bill would i be and i have a
 
00:36:11.750 --> 00:36:11.760 align:start position:0%
home on that acreage would i then be
 
00:36:13.670 --> 00:36:13.680 align:start position:0%
allowed to
 
00:36:16.150 --> 00:36:16.160 align:start position:0%
construct new construction of four
 
00:36:19.030 --> 00:36:19.040 align:start position:0%
single units on that lot
 
00:36:21.510 --> 00:36:21.520 align:start position:0%
it's a total of four and it would depend
 
00:36:24.829 --> 00:36:24.839 align:start position:0%
on what your local ordinance says about
 
00:36:24.839 --> 00:36:26.710 align:start position:0%
on what your local ordinance says about
setbacks

00:36:26.710 --> 00:36:26.720 align:start position:0%
setbacks
 
00:36:29.030 --> 00:36:29.040 align:start position:0%
lot coverage and parking requirements as
 
00:36:30.870 --> 00:36:30.880 align:start position:0%
to whether you could do it because you
 
00:36:32.950 --> 00:36:32.960 align:start position:0%
have to abide by that
 
00:36:35.910 --> 00:36:35.920 align:start position:0%
so if you have a lot that is big enough
 
00:36:37.910 --> 00:36:37.920 align:start position:0%
to park however many
 
00:36:39.990 --> 00:36:40.000 align:start position:0%
units you're proposing and you have
 
00:36:42.550 --> 00:36:42.560 align:start position:0%
water and sewer and you can maintain the
 
00:36:45.670 --> 00:36:45.680 align:start position:0%
setbacks and you can meet the coverage
 
00:36:48.470 --> 00:36:48.480 align:start position:0%
requirements then yes you would be able
 
00:36:51.030 --> 00:36:51.040 align:start position:0%
to and and i'd add that the goal here is
 
00:36:53.829 --> 00:36:53.839 align:start position:0%
to make this straight forward for people
 
00:36:56.310 --> 00:36:56.320 align:start position:0%
often people can do this
 
00:36:59.349 --> 00:36:59.359 align:start position:0%
if they go and apply for a variance but
 
00:37:01.910 --> 00:37:01.920 align:start position:0%
that's another step and since so many of
 
00:37:04.069 --> 00:37:04.079 align:start position:0%
these conversions are done by the people
 
00:37:05.829 --> 00:37:05.839 align:start position:0%
who live in them
 
00:37:08.069 --> 00:37:08.079 align:start position:0%
it's that's a step that makes it more
 
00:37:09.670 --> 00:37:09.680 align:start position:0%
complicated and they're likely to throw
 
00:37:11.030 --> 00:37:11.040 align:start position:0%
up their hands and say you know this is
 
00:37:13.109 --> 00:37:13.119 align:start position:0%
just too hard i can't do it
 
00:37:15.349 --> 00:37:15.359 align:start position:0%
follow up mr chair yes go ahead thank
 
00:37:15.359 --> 00:37:16.069 align:start position:0%
follow up mr chair yes go ahead thank
you

00:37:16.069 --> 00:37:16.079 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:37:22.550 --> 00:37:22.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:25.510 --> 00:37:25.520 align:start position:0%
an owner of a single family lot may need
 
00:37:28.790 --> 00:37:28.800 align:start position:0%
to subdivide that lot if that is
 
00:37:32.069 --> 00:37:32.079 align:start position:0%
required by the town i mean no no
 
00:37:34.230 --> 00:37:34.240 align:start position:0%
this explicitly says you're not you
 
00:37:36.550 --> 00:37:36.560 align:start position:0%
don't have to subdivide this says
 
00:37:39.670 --> 00:37:39.680 align:start position:0%
explicitly that one single lot not
 
00:37:43.190 --> 00:37:43.200 align:start position:0%
subdivided can have up to four units
 
00:37:46.310 --> 00:37:46.320 align:start position:0%
provided that you meet all of the other
 
00:37:55.670 --> 00:37:55.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:57.589 --> 00:37:57.599 align:start position:0%
thank you representative ann for taking
 
00:37:59.430 --> 00:37:59.440 align:start position:0%
my question
 
00:38:02.630 --> 00:38:02.640 align:start position:0%
would you agree with me that if this was
 
00:38:04.870 --> 00:38:04.880 align:start position:0%
made optional
 
00:38:06.630 --> 00:38:06.640 align:start position:0%
that a
 
00:38:06.640 --> 00:38:07.670 align:start position:0%
that a
town

00:38:07.670 --> 00:38:07.680 align:start position:0%
town
 
00:38:10.790 --> 00:38:10.800 align:start position:0%
that made it optional and allowed this
 
00:38:12.310 --> 00:38:12.320 align:start position:0%
sort of thing
 
00:38:14.390 --> 00:38:14.400 align:start position:0%
and if it wasn't
 
00:38:16.870 --> 00:38:16.880 align:start position:0%
a statewide rule
 
00:38:20.630 --> 00:38:20.640 align:start position:0%
that if that was the only town that that
 
00:38:22.470 --> 00:38:22.480 align:start position:0%
opted to do that
 
00:38:25.030 --> 00:38:25.040 align:start position:0%
that they would be inundated
 
00:38:25.040 --> 00:38:25.990 align:start position:0%
that they would be inundated
by

00:38:25.990 --> 00:38:26.000 align:start position:0%
by
 
00:38:28.710 --> 00:38:28.720 align:start position:0%
by developers wanting to take advantage
 
00:38:29.750 --> 00:38:29.760 align:start position:0%
of that
 
00:38:32.630 --> 00:38:32.640 align:start position:0%
and surrounding towns who opted not to
 
00:38:34.950 --> 00:38:34.960 align:start position:0%
would be sitting there saying well look
 
00:38:37.270 --> 00:38:37.280 align:start position:0%
you know it's your fault
 
00:38:39.670 --> 00:38:39.680 align:start position:0%
uh yes i would completely believe that i
 
00:38:41.430 --> 00:38:41.440 align:start position:0%
i don't think that this is going to
 
00:38:43.270 --> 00:38:43.280 align:start position:0%
empower developers to do a whole lot
 
00:38:45.430 --> 00:38:45.440 align:start position:0%
because as i said this is not a bill
 
00:38:48.230 --> 00:38:48.240 align:start position:0%
that appeals to big developers
 
00:38:48.240 --> 00:38:49.190 align:start position:0%
that appeals to big developers
but

00:38:49.190 --> 00:38:49.200 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:38:52.150 --> 00:38:52.160 align:start position:0%
my own observation as a person who works
 
00:38:53.510 --> 00:38:53.520 align:start position:0%
in this field
 
00:38:56.310 --> 00:38:56.320 align:start position:0%
is that one of the problems with
 
00:38:58.870 --> 00:38:58.880 align:start position:0%
proposing an ordinance change in any
 
00:39:01.750 --> 00:39:01.760 align:start position:0%
given town to allow historically
 
00:39:03.430 --> 00:39:03.440 align:start position:0%
appropriate density which is what this
 
00:39:05.589 --> 00:39:05.599 align:start position:0%
is these buildings already exist in most
 
00:39:05.599 --> 00:39:06.630 align:start position:0%
is these buildings already exist in most
places

00:39:06.630 --> 00:39:06.640 align:start position:0%
places
 
00:39:09.589 --> 00:39:09.599 align:start position:0%
that the response from the
 
00:39:11.510 --> 00:39:11.520 align:start position:0%
voters is why should we do this because
 
00:39:17.190 --> 00:39:17.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:19.270 --> 00:39:19.280 align:start position:0%
representative gilman
 
00:39:20.790 --> 00:39:20.800 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
00:39:23.430 --> 00:39:23.440 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh last year we saw a
 
00:39:24.710 --> 00:39:24.720 align:start position:0%
similar bill
 
00:39:27.430 --> 00:39:27.440 align:start position:0%
um that mandated this uh
 
00:39:29.349 --> 00:39:29.359 align:start position:0%
throughout the state uh you know
 
00:39:31.750 --> 00:39:31.760 align:start position:0%
provided the water and sewer and the um
 
00:39:33.990 --> 00:39:34.000 align:start position:0%
and the setbacks etcetera were provided
 
00:39:35.829 --> 00:39:35.839 align:start position:0%
now it says uh
 
00:39:37.990 --> 00:39:38.000 align:start position:0%
the local legislative
 
00:39:40.710 --> 00:39:40.720 align:start position:0%
legislative body uh would enact this so
 
00:39:44.470 --> 00:39:44.480 align:start position:0%
it's a local uh no this is a this is not
 
00:39:46.790 --> 00:39:46.800 align:start position:0%
an enabling this is not an enabling bill
 
00:39:50.150 --> 00:39:50.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:53.109 --> 00:39:53.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:54.630 --> 00:39:54.640 align:start position:0%
if it doesn't say that then i need
 
00:39:56.550 --> 00:39:56.560 align:start position:0%
another amendment
 
00:39:58.310 --> 00:39:58.320 align:start position:0%
because it's intended and because of the
 
00:40:00.990 --> 00:40:01.000 align:start position:0%
reason i just explained to uh
 
00:40:03.750 --> 00:40:03.760 align:start position:0%
representatives because one season two
 
00:40:05.750 --> 00:40:05.760 align:start position:0%
one at a time doesn't work we've tried
 
00:40:08.550 --> 00:40:08.560 align:start position:0%
one at a time for 40 years and it just
 
00:40:12.230 --> 00:40:12.240 align:start position:0%
doesn't work thank you
 
00:40:14.550 --> 00:40:14.560 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
00:40:15.670 --> 00:40:15.680 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you
 
00:40:17.270 --> 00:40:17.280 align:start position:0%
representative taking my question many
 
00:40:18.790 --> 00:40:18.800 align:start position:0%
of us sit on planning boards here and
 
00:40:21.030 --> 00:40:21.040 align:start position:0%
i'm looking to your expertise as it is
 
00:40:21.040 --> 00:40:21.910 align:start position:0%
i'm looking to your expertise as it is
your

00:40:21.910 --> 00:40:21.920 align:start position:0%
your
 
00:40:23.510 --> 00:40:23.520 align:start position:0%
profession one of the things that we
 
00:40:25.910 --> 00:40:25.920 align:start position:0%
consider is emergency services you'd
 
00:40:27.750 --> 00:40:27.760 align:start position:0%
have to put in some type i assume with
 
00:40:29.349 --> 00:40:29.359 align:start position:0%
this you'd have to put in some type of
 
00:40:29.359 --> 00:40:30.470 align:start position:0%
this you'd have to put in some type of
access

00:40:30.470 --> 00:40:30.480 align:start position:0%
access
 
00:40:31.990 --> 00:40:32.000 align:start position:0%
to those structures you might have to
 
00:40:33.750 --> 00:40:33.760 align:start position:0%
extend access
 
00:40:36.550 --> 00:40:36.560 align:start position:0%
this bill would not limit the
 
00:40:39.990 --> 00:40:40.000 align:start position:0%
authority of review of the emergency
 
00:40:42.150 --> 00:40:42.160 align:start position:0%
service access to that
 
00:40:44.309 --> 00:40:44.319 align:start position:0%
and then you know base the final
 
00:40:45.990 --> 00:40:46.000 align:start position:0%
decision on whether or not they can or
 
00:40:47.430 --> 00:40:47.440 align:start position:0%
cannot safely
 
00:40:49.589 --> 00:40:49.599 align:start position:0%
evacuate people from that
 
00:40:51.670 --> 00:40:51.680 align:start position:0%
that's absolutely correct that falls
 
00:40:54.470 --> 00:40:54.480 align:start position:0%
under all those local rules
 
00:40:56.309 --> 00:40:56.319 align:start position:0%
so for example if i wanted to build a
 
00:40:59.109 --> 00:40:59.119 align:start position:0%
cottage court and i
 
00:40:59.119 --> 00:40:59.990 align:start position:0%
cottage court and i
have

00:40:59.990 --> 00:41:00.000 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:41:02.390 --> 00:41:02.400 align:start position:0%
structured it in such a way that the
 
00:41:04.470 --> 00:41:04.480 align:start position:0%
buildings are too far from the street
 
00:41:06.950 --> 00:41:06.960 align:start position:0%
i'm going to have to either put in a
 
00:41:09.670 --> 00:41:09.680 align:start position:0%
hydrant or i'm going to have to you know
 
00:41:12.470 --> 00:41:12.480 align:start position:0%
harden the sides of my narrow driveway
 
00:41:15.030 --> 00:41:15.040 align:start position:0%
so that a fire truck can fit yes all
 
00:41:18.230 --> 00:41:18.240 align:start position:0%
those things still apply
 
00:41:22.550 --> 00:41:22.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:23.750 --> 00:41:23.760 align:start position:0%
i i
 
00:41:27.589 --> 00:41:27.599 align:start position:0%
wasn't raising my hand um
 
00:41:29.589 --> 00:41:29.599 align:start position:0%
or were you done
 
00:41:32.069 --> 00:41:32.079 align:start position:0%
okay um all right so yeah
 
00:41:35.030 --> 00:41:35.040 align:start position:0%
i'll testify then
 
00:41:37.030 --> 00:41:37.040 align:start position:0%
well before we before we do that
 
00:41:40.710 --> 00:41:40.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:40.720 --> 00:41:41.910 align:start position:0%
 
uh

00:41:41.910 --> 00:41:41.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:41:43.349 --> 00:41:43.359 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you for taking
 
00:41:44.630 --> 00:41:44.640 align:start position:0%
my question
 
00:41:44.640 --> 00:41:45.430 align:start position:0%
my question
uh

00:41:45.430 --> 00:41:45.440 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:41:49.990 --> 00:41:50.000 align:start position:0%
back to uh line four it says that
 
00:41:52.870 --> 00:41:52.880 align:start position:0%
a city town or county in which are
 
00:41:56.069 --> 00:41:56.079 align:start position:0%
located on unincorporated places and
 
00:41:56.079 --> 00:41:57.109 align:start position:0%
located on unincorporated places and
towns

00:41:57.109 --> 00:41:57.119 align:start position:0%
towns
 
00:41:57.119 --> 00:41:58.150 align:start position:0%
towns
uh

00:41:58.150 --> 00:41:58.160 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:42:02.069 --> 00:42:02.079 align:start position:0%
if the city doesn't have unincorporated
 
00:42:03.109 --> 00:42:03.119 align:start position:0%
or una
 
00:42:03.119 --> 00:42:04.069 align:start position:0%
or una
grace

00:42:04.069 --> 00:42:04.079 align:start position:0%
grace
 
00:42:05.910 --> 00:42:05.920 align:start position:0%
unorganized places
 
00:42:07.589 --> 00:42:07.599 align:start position:0%
but the county does would that take
 
00:42:07.599 --> 00:42:08.950 align:start position:0%
but the county does would that take
precedence

00:42:08.950 --> 00:42:08.960 align:start position:0%
precedence
 
00:42:10.470 --> 00:42:10.480 align:start position:0%
that's a question i would have to ask
 
00:42:14.150 --> 00:42:14.160 align:start position:0%
ols as i said earlier i asked them why
 
00:42:16.470 --> 00:42:16.480 align:start position:0%
that language was in there and they said
 
00:42:19.109 --> 00:42:19.119 align:start position:0%
this is the way that we write it for any
 
00:42:22.470 --> 00:42:22.480 align:start position:0%
bill that affects land use statutes
 
00:42:25.910 --> 00:42:25.920 align:start position:0%
so i will ask my understanding is that
 
00:42:29.750 --> 00:42:29.760 align:start position:0%
what this does is if a place later had
 
00:42:31.510 --> 00:42:31.520 align:start position:0%
water and sewer
 
00:42:33.910 --> 00:42:33.920 align:start position:0%
you know if it if it you know suddenly
 
00:42:35.910 --> 00:42:35.920 align:start position:0%
had water and sewer this would apply
 
00:42:38.630 --> 00:42:38.640 align:start position:0%
municipal water and sewer but that's
 
00:42:40.790 --> 00:42:40.800 align:start position:0%
just the boilerplate language they used
 
00:42:42.150 --> 00:42:42.160 align:start position:0%
to describe
 
00:42:45.109 --> 00:42:45.119 align:start position:0%
land area in new hampshire i'll find out
 
00:42:46.790 --> 00:42:46.800 align:start position:0%
and if we need to if we need an
 
00:42:49.589 --> 00:42:49.599 align:start position:0%
amendment um i'm happy to offer one but
 
00:42:52.230 --> 00:42:52.240 align:start position:0%
i'll check on it again for you thank you
 
00:42:56.309 --> 00:42:56.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:58.790 --> 00:42:58.800 align:start position:0%
the testifier to ask a question uh to
 
00:43:00.230 --> 00:43:00.240 align:start position:0%
ask a question
 
00:43:02.309 --> 00:43:02.319 align:start position:0%
i think he only wants to testify yeah i
 
00:43:04.150 --> 00:43:04.160 align:start position:0%
submitted the pink card because i wanted
 
00:43:05.589 --> 00:43:05.599 align:start position:0%
to testify
 
00:43:05.599 --> 00:43:07.910 align:start position:0%
to testify
okay

00:43:07.910 --> 00:43:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:09.829 --> 00:43:09.839 align:start position:0%
you know that if you testify then that
 
00:43:11.910 --> 00:43:11.920 align:start position:0%
limits your ability to participate in
 
00:43:14.390 --> 00:43:14.400 align:start position:0%
the discussion
 
00:43:14.400 --> 00:43:15.510 align:start position:0%
the discussion
um

00:43:15.510 --> 00:43:15.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:17.510 --> 00:43:17.520 align:start position:0%
yeah well i haven't asked any questions
 
00:43:19.190 --> 00:43:19.200 align:start position:0%
so far so
 
00:43:19.200 --> 00:43:20.150 align:start position:0%
so far so
um

00:43:20.150 --> 00:43:20.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:23.270 --> 00:43:23.280 align:start position:0%
i i'm aware of that
 
00:43:25.190 --> 00:43:25.200 align:start position:0%
we what we do is
 
00:43:28.230 --> 00:43:28.240 align:start position:0%
if if a member of the committee
 
00:43:31.349 --> 00:43:31.359 align:start position:0%
testifies then when it comes when
 
00:43:36.390 --> 00:43:36.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:39.190 --> 00:43:39.200 align:start position:0%
any further discussion on the bill
 
00:43:41.829 --> 00:43:41.839 align:start position:0%
you will be allowed to participate
 
00:43:44.309 --> 00:43:44.319 align:start position:0%
completely at the executive session but
 
00:43:45.750 --> 00:43:45.760 align:start position:0%
in the hearing
 
00:43:45.760 --> 00:43:46.470 align:start position:0%
in the hearing
uh

00:43:46.470 --> 00:43:46.480 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:43:49.589 --> 00:43:49.599 align:start position:0%
that's when the limit takes effect
 
00:43:52.550 --> 00:43:52.560 align:start position:0%
you still want to testify um
 
00:43:52.560 --> 00:43:54.550 align:start position:0%
you still want to testify um
yeah

00:43:54.550 --> 00:43:54.560 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:43:57.030 --> 00:43:57.040 align:start position:0%
mr chairman i have a point of order
 
00:43:58.630 --> 00:43:58.640 align:start position:0%
yes um
 
00:44:01.030 --> 00:44:01.040 align:start position:0%
i i don't know if it's uh consistent
 
00:44:02.870 --> 00:44:02.880 align:start position:0%
from committee to committee but are
 
00:44:05.030 --> 00:44:05.040 align:start position:0%
co-sponsors allowed to
 
00:44:07.030 --> 00:44:07.040 align:start position:0%
uh question during a public hearing or
 
00:44:09.109 --> 00:44:09.119 align:start position:0%
just testify or do they have the choice
 
00:44:10.309 --> 00:44:10.319 align:start position:0%
that was my
 
00:44:11.750 --> 00:44:11.760 align:start position:0%
purpose in
 
00:44:14.550 --> 00:44:14.560 align:start position:0%
questioning representative gallagher
 
00:44:16.630 --> 00:44:16.640 align:start position:0%
no the answer to the question is no
 
00:44:17.829 --> 00:44:17.839 align:start position:0%
that's why
 
00:44:19.990 --> 00:44:20.000 align:start position:0%
it would not be proper for him to
 
00:44:22.950 --> 00:44:22.960 align:start position:0%
question representative van
 
00:44:26.309 --> 00:44:26.319 align:start position:0%
as a co-sponsor if he wants to
 
00:44:31.910 --> 00:44:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:33.589 --> 00:44:33.599 align:start position:0%
thank you all very much for listening to
 
00:44:35.589 --> 00:44:35.599 align:start position:0%
my ted talk i'm always happy to talk
 
00:44:38.870 --> 00:44:38.880 align:start position:0%
about housing mr chair i have a question
 
00:44:39.829 --> 00:44:39.839 align:start position:0%
for you
 
00:44:42.150 --> 00:44:42.160 align:start position:0%
i'm a co-sponsor on this but i'm not
 
00:44:44.550 --> 00:44:44.560 align:start position:0%

00:45:11.680 --> 00:45:12.950 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:45:12.950 --> 00:45:12.960 align:start position:0%

many of the reasons
 
00:45:48.150 --> 00:45:48.160 align:start position:0%
that representative fan
 
00:45:50.790 --> 00:45:50.800 align:start position:0%
shared up i just wanted to testify to
 
00:45:53.190 --> 00:45:53.200 align:start position:0%
share some of my
 
00:45:56.309 --> 00:45:56.319 align:start position:0%

so

00:46:01.430 --> 00:46:01.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:46:02.470 --> 00:46:02.480 align:start position:0%
i grew up
 
00:46:03.990 --> 00:46:04.000 align:start position:0%
i grew up here
 
00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:05.349 align:start position:0%
i grew up here
in

00:46:05.349 --> 00:46:05.359 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:46:08.230 --> 00:46:08.240 align:start position:0%
new hampshire in a single family home
 
00:46:10.950 --> 00:46:10.960 align:start position:0%
and i'm now living in one of those big

apartment complexes
 
00:46:16.150 --> 00:46:16.160 align:start position:0%
my younger brother on the other hand
 
00:46:18.069 --> 00:46:18.079 align:start position:0%
currently moved
 
00:46:18.079 --> 00:46:19.109 align:start position:0%
currently moved
currently

00:46:19.109 --> 00:46:19.119 align:start position:0%
currently
 
00:46:22.390 --> 00:46:22.400 align:start position:0%
is living out in portland oregon and he
 
00:46:24.630 --> 00:46:24.640 align:start position:0%
is actually living
 
00:46:26.870 --> 00:46:26.880 align:start position:0%
in the fourplex
 
00:46:26.880 --> 00:46:29.030 align:start position:0%
in the fourplex
himself

00:46:29.030 --> 00:46:29.040 align:start position:0%
himself
 
00:46:29.040 --> 00:46:30.470 align:start position:0%
himself
currently

00:46:30.470 --> 00:46:30.480 align:start position:0%
currently
 
00:46:34.710 --> 00:46:34.720 align:start position:0%
and um i actually went out to visit him
 
00:46:37.910 --> 00:46:37.920 align:start position:0%
this fall and
 
00:46:42.309 --> 00:46:42.319 align:start position:0%
you know it's a it's a very nice
 
00:46:42.319 --> 00:46:43.109 align:start position:0%
you know it's a it's a very nice
um

00:46:43.109 --> 00:46:43.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:45.270 --> 00:46:45.280 align:start position:0%
it you know it's a very nice
 
00:46:47.829 --> 00:46:47.839 align:start position:0%
living space and
 
00:46:49.030 --> 00:46:49.040 align:start position:0%
um it
 
00:46:51.190 --> 00:46:51.200 align:start position:0%
was pretty easy to
 
00:46:53.750 --> 00:46:53.760 align:start position:0%
i wasn't actually able to stay with him
 
00:46:53.760 --> 00:46:54.790 align:start position:0%
i wasn't actually able to stay with him
himself

00:46:54.790 --> 00:46:54.800 align:start position:0%
himself
 
00:46:57.670 --> 00:46:57.680 align:start position:0%
but i was able to find a nearby airbnb
 
00:46:59.270 --> 00:46:59.280 align:start position:0%
pretty easily
 
00:47:00.470 --> 00:47:00.480 align:start position:0%
so um
 
00:47:02.550 --> 00:47:02.560 align:start position:0%
yeah one of the reasons
 
00:47:04.309 --> 00:47:04.319 align:start position:0%
he's living there instead of continuing
 
00:47:05.829 --> 00:47:05.839 align:start position:0%
to live here is because he's able to
 
00:47:07.510 --> 00:47:07.520 align:start position:0%
find housing there
 
00:47:09.510 --> 00:47:09.520 align:start position:0%
so you know that's just an example of
 
00:47:09.520 --> 00:47:10.870 align:start position:0%
so you know that's just an example of
how

00:47:10.870 --> 00:47:10.880 align:start position:0%
how
 
00:47:12.390 --> 00:47:12.400 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
00:47:12.400 --> 00:47:13.430 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
is

00:47:13.430 --> 00:47:13.440 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:47:15.270 --> 00:47:15.280 align:start position:0%
losing out on
 
00:47:15.280 --> 00:47:16.550 align:start position:0%
losing out on
um

00:47:16.550 --> 00:47:16.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:19.030 --> 00:47:19.040 align:start position:0%
young dynamic members of our workforce
 
00:47:21.829 --> 00:47:21.839 align:start position:0%
to other places that can
 
00:47:23.510 --> 00:47:23.520 align:start position:0%
properly house them
 
00:47:23.520 --> 00:47:25.670 align:start position:0%
properly house them
so

00:47:25.670 --> 00:47:25.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:47:27.670 --> 00:47:27.680 align:start position:0%
if we want to
 
00:47:30.150 --> 00:47:30.160 align:start position:0%
keep people like him in this state we
 
00:47:30.160 --> 00:47:31.109 align:start position:0%
keep people like him in this state we
should

00:47:31.109 --> 00:47:31.119 align:start position:0%
should
 
00:47:34.150 --> 00:47:34.160 align:start position:0%
provide proper housing for them and pass
 
00:47:34.160 --> 00:47:35.030 align:start position:0%
provide proper housing for them and pass
this

00:47:35.030 --> 00:47:35.040 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:47:37.030 --> 00:47:37.040 align:start position:0%
fourplex bell
 
00:47:37.040 --> 00:47:38.710 align:start position:0%
fourplex bell
um

00:47:38.710 --> 00:47:38.720 align:start position:0%

um
and

00:47:40.950 --> 00:47:40.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:47:42.470 --> 00:47:42.480 align:start position:0%
um yeah i'll
 
00:47:44.630 --> 00:47:44.640 align:start position:0%
take any questions about
 
00:47:51.030 --> 00:47:51.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:54.630 --> 00:47:54.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:55.589 --> 00:47:55.599 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:47:58.309 --> 00:47:58.319 align:start position:0%
next we have uh

hampshire
 
00:48:16.390 --> 00:48:16.400 align:start position:0%
we're a development company that does
 
00:48:18.069 --> 00:48:18.079 align:start position:0%
master planning of community conscious
 
00:48:20.549 --> 00:48:20.559 align:start position:0%
development projects that also dovetails
 
00:48:22.470 --> 00:48:22.480 align:start position:0%
closely with downtown revitalization
 
00:48:23.990 --> 00:48:24.000 align:start position:0%
efforts which i've been working on with
 
00:48:25.990 --> 00:48:26.000 align:start position:0%
representative laurel davis for the past
 
00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:27.030 align:start position:0%
representative laurel davis for the past
year

00:48:27.030 --> 00:48:27.040 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:48:28.549 --> 00:48:28.559 align:start position:0%
i'm here to testify in support of
 
00:48:31.190 --> 00:48:31.200 align:start position:0%
representative van's bill which enables
 
00:48:32.870 --> 00:48:32.880 align:start position:0%
the kind of smart growth that our city
 
00:48:34.470 --> 00:48:34.480 align:start position:0%
and town centers need as we look to
 
00:48:35.990 --> 00:48:36.000 align:start position:0%
reinvest in the next era of new
 
00:48:38.150 --> 00:48:38.160 align:start position:0%
hampshire and address a housing shortage
 
00:48:39.829 --> 00:48:39.839 align:start position:0%
that is limiting our economic growth in
 
00:48:41.349 --> 00:48:41.359 align:start position:0%
the upper valley
 
00:48:43.349 --> 00:48:43.359 align:start position:0%
i'm speaking as a developer but i want
 
00:48:45.190 --> 00:48:45.200 align:start position:0%
to emphasize rep van's point that this
 
00:48:46.470 --> 00:48:46.480 align:start position:0%
is about making the development of
 
00:48:49.109 --> 00:48:49.119 align:start position:0%
housing approachable to everyone
 
00:48:51.109 --> 00:48:51.119 align:start position:0%
i'm an aspirational missing middle
 
00:48:52.950 --> 00:48:52.960 align:start position:0%
housing developer
 
00:48:54.870 --> 00:48:54.880 align:start position:0%
i say aspirational because i'm currently
 
00:48:56.390 --> 00:48:56.400 align:start position:0%
prohibited from developing the type of
 
00:48:58.309 --> 00:48:58.319 align:start position:0%
housing we're talking about today
 
00:49:00.390 --> 00:49:00.400 align:start position:0%
on property that i own in west lebanon
 
00:49:02.230 --> 00:49:02.240 align:start position:0%
that is already served by water and
 
00:49:04.309 --> 00:49:04.319 align:start position:0%
sewer infrastructure
 
00:49:06.870 --> 00:49:06.880 align:start position:0%
central to the idea of smart growth is
 
00:49:08.870 --> 00:49:08.880 align:start position:0%
the idea of maximizing the use of that
 
00:49:10.549 --> 00:49:10.559 align:start position:0%
existing infrastructure
 
00:49:12.470 --> 00:49:12.480 align:start position:0%
but as our land use policy and approval
 
00:49:13.670 --> 00:49:13.680 align:start position:0%
stand today
 
00:49:15.430 --> 00:49:15.440 align:start position:0%
i can build one unit
 
00:49:18.710 --> 00:49:18.720 align:start position:0%
or i can build 125 units but i can't do
 
00:49:20.790 --> 00:49:20.800 align:start position:0%
anything in the middle
 
00:49:22.790 --> 00:49:22.800 align:start position:0%
i've spent months and thousands of
 
00:49:24.390 --> 00:49:24.400 align:start position:0%
dollars trying to
 
00:49:27.270 --> 00:49:27.280 align:start position:0%
only to have it shot down because of
 
00:49:29.829 --> 00:49:29.839 align:start position:0%
old thinking around smart neighborhood
 
00:49:32.549 --> 00:49:32.559 align:start position:0%
specific density
 
00:49:34.470 --> 00:49:34.480 align:start position:0%
i'm going to try again this year to
 
00:49:36.710 --> 00:49:36.720 align:start position:0%
propose neighborhood appropriate density
 
00:49:38.150 --> 00:49:38.160 align:start position:0%
that takes advantage of that shared
 
00:49:41.109 --> 00:49:41.119 align:start position:0%
infrastructure access to public transit
 
00:49:42.870 --> 00:49:42.880 align:start position:0%
and creates the kind of housing that
 
00:49:44.790 --> 00:49:44.800 align:start position:0%
people keep showing up at my office
 
00:49:48.150 --> 00:49:48.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:49.829 --> 00:49:49.839 align:start position:0%
you can look to municipalities elsewhere
 
00:49:51.829 --> 00:49:51.839 align:start position:0%
in the country that are effectively
 
00:49:53.750 --> 00:49:53.760 align:start position:0%
deploying policies like that which
 
00:49:56.150 --> 00:49:56.160 align:start position:0%
representative anne has proposed today
 
00:49:57.910 --> 00:49:57.920 align:start position:0%
but you can also just look at our own
 
00:49:59.670 --> 00:49:59.680 align:start position:0%
towns and cities where this typology
 
00:50:01.349 --> 00:50:01.359 align:start position:0%
already exists as part of the community
 
00:50:03.430 --> 00:50:03.440 align:start position:0%
fabric it has for decades
 
00:50:06.630 --> 00:50:06.640 align:start position:0%
we just unintentionally zoned out what
 
00:50:10.230 --> 00:50:10.240 align:start position:0%
has worked for our communities
 
00:50:11.670 --> 00:50:11.680 align:start position:0%
these four plexes are not a new and
 
00:50:13.589 --> 00:50:13.599 align:start position:0%
mysterious idea they've been part of the
 
00:50:16.309 --> 00:50:16.319 align:start position:0%
landscape for decades
 
00:50:18.470 --> 00:50:18.480 align:start position:0%
but the procedural gymnastics required
 
00:50:20.870 --> 00:50:20.880 align:start position:0%
to even propose housing that is denser
 
00:50:24.309 --> 00:50:24.319 align:start position:0%
than a single family is preventative
 
00:50:26.390 --> 00:50:26.400 align:start position:0%
we're asking to put a tool back in the
 
00:50:28.950 --> 00:50:28.960 align:start position:0%
toolbox for housing development
 
00:50:30.710 --> 00:50:30.720 align:start position:0%
not a mandate just a tool for
 
00:50:33.910 --> 00:50:33.920 align:start position:0%
consideration a tool that was taken out
 
00:50:36.390 --> 00:50:36.400 align:start position:0%
unintentionally decades ago that we need
 
00:50:36.400 --> 00:50:37.910 align:start position:0%
unintentionally decades ago that we need
back

00:50:37.910 --> 00:50:37.920 align:start position:0%
back
 
00:50:39.829 --> 00:50:39.839 align:start position:0%
i think these are a great addition as
 
00:50:41.750 --> 00:50:41.760 align:start position:0%
someone said to our existing
 
00:50:43.589 --> 00:50:43.599 align:start position:0%
communities where we need neighborhood
 
00:50:45.750 --> 00:50:45.760 align:start position:0%
appropriate density and i think this is
 
00:50:47.349 --> 00:50:47.359 align:start position:0%
a fantastic bill that representative
 
00:50:49.670 --> 00:50:49.680 align:start position:0%
anne has advanced thank you
 
00:50:51.750 --> 00:50:51.760 align:start position:0%
any questions from mr clement
 
00:50:51.760 --> 00:50:52.829 align:start position:0%
any questions from mr clement
yes

00:50:52.829 --> 00:50:52.839 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:50:55.589 --> 00:50:55.599 align:start position:0%
representative thank you mr chair thank
 
00:50:58.710 --> 00:50:58.720 align:start position:0%
you mr clem for taking my question my
 
00:51:01.750 --> 00:51:01.760 align:start position:0%
question is as a developer what kind of
 
00:51:04.710 --> 00:51:04.720 align:start position:0%
clientele are approaching you to develop
 
00:51:07.349 --> 00:51:07.359 align:start position:0%
such a unit is it just a
 
00:51:10.230 --> 00:51:10.240 align:start position:0%
younger generation or people like me who
 
00:51:13.510 --> 00:51:13.520 align:start position:0%
are looking towards aging in place
 
00:51:15.030 --> 00:51:15.040 align:start position:0%
or is it mixed of both
 
00:51:15.040 --> 00:51:17.510 align:start position:0%
or is it mixed of both
multi-generational

00:51:17.510 --> 00:51:17.520 align:start position:0%
multi-generational
 
00:51:19.910 --> 00:51:19.920 align:start position:0%
both you know i
 
00:51:22.470 --> 00:51:22.480 align:start position:0%
think of this type of housing as what
 
00:51:25.270 --> 00:51:25.280 align:start position:0%
appeals to young couples starting out
 
00:51:27.829 --> 00:51:27.839 align:start position:0%
and older couples downsizing
 
00:51:28.950 --> 00:51:28.960 align:start position:0%
we see obviously with
 
00:51:30.470 --> 00:51:30.480 align:start position:0%
dartmouth-hitchcock medical center and
 
00:51:31.750 --> 00:51:31.760 align:start position:0%
the college
 
00:51:33.990 --> 00:51:34.000 align:start position:0%
already a housing shortage and influx
 
00:51:36.150 --> 00:51:36.160 align:start position:0%
certainly compounded by the past couple
 
00:51:37.829 --> 00:51:37.839 align:start position:0%
years of the pandemic i think we were
 
00:51:39.349 --> 00:51:39.359 align:start position:0%
one of the 10
 
00:51:41.829 --> 00:51:41.839 align:start position:0%
largest net influx growth areas in the
 
00:51:43.750 --> 00:51:43.760 align:start position:0%
country for the times
 
00:51:46.790 --> 00:51:46.800 align:start position:0%
so i get people that are looking at
 
00:51:48.710 --> 00:51:48.720 align:start position:0%
academia jobs looking at professional
 
00:51:51.670 --> 00:51:51.680 align:start position:0%
jobs who are starting out and cannot
 
00:51:51.680 --> 00:51:52.950 align:start position:0%
jobs who are starting out and cannot
approach

00:51:52.950 --> 00:51:52.960 align:start position:0%
approach
 
00:51:55.829 --> 00:51:55.839 align:start position:0%
a single family home that is
 
00:52:00.069 --> 00:52:00.079 align:start position:0%
suddenly 400 500 000
 
00:52:01.829 --> 00:52:01.839 align:start position:0%
but when they relocate to new hampshire
 
00:52:03.030 --> 00:52:03.040 align:start position:0%
to enjoy
 
00:52:04.790 --> 00:52:04.800 align:start position:0%
the quality of life that we all enjoy
 
00:52:04.800 --> 00:52:05.589 align:start position:0%
the quality of life that we all enjoy
here

00:52:05.589 --> 00:52:05.599 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:52:08.069 --> 00:52:08.079 align:start position:0%
they're not necessarily looking for that
 
00:52:10.150 --> 00:52:10.160 align:start position:0%
four-story five-story
 
00:52:11.910 --> 00:52:11.920 align:start position:0%
uh multi-family building that they could
 
00:52:13.670 --> 00:52:13.680 align:start position:0%
live in elsewhere in the country they
 
00:52:16.309 --> 00:52:16.319 align:start position:0%
want to live where the activity is where
 
00:52:17.670 --> 00:52:17.680 align:start position:0%
the coffee shops are where the
 
00:52:19.030 --> 00:52:19.040 align:start position:0%
neighborhoods are
 
00:52:21.750 --> 00:52:21.760 align:start position:0%
uh but it's increasingly hard to do so
 
00:52:21.760 --> 00:52:23.349 align:start position:0%
uh but it's increasingly hard to do so
representative

00:52:23.349 --> 00:52:23.359 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:52:25.190 --> 00:52:25.200 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry
 
00:52:26.309 --> 00:52:26.319 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
00:52:27.670 --> 00:52:27.680 align:start position:0%
thank you mr
 
00:52:32.069 --> 00:52:32.079 align:start position:0%
chair isn't isn't it true that in in the
 
00:52:34.790 --> 00:52:34.800 align:start position:0%
college both dartmouth college and the
 
00:52:36.230 --> 00:52:36.240 align:start position:0%
medical center
 
00:52:38.950 --> 00:52:38.960 align:start position:0%
is providing incentive to the local
 
00:52:41.750 --> 00:52:41.760 align:start position:0%
single-family residents to
 
00:52:43.829 --> 00:52:43.839 align:start position:0%
single-family homeowners
 
00:52:47.270 --> 00:52:47.280 align:start position:0%
to take in paying guests and the
 
00:52:50.069 --> 00:52:50.079 align:start position:0%
university would pay for their housing
 
00:52:52.549 --> 00:52:52.559 align:start position:0%
that they cannot provide on campus for
 
00:52:52.559 --> 00:52:53.589 align:start position:0%
that they cannot provide on campus for
them

00:52:53.589 --> 00:52:53.599 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:52:56.069 --> 00:52:56.079 align:start position:0%
i can't speak to that specifically but i
 
00:52:58.470 --> 00:52:58.480 align:start position:0%
know that with
 
00:53:00.390 --> 00:53:00.400 align:start position:0%
hundreds of students being on campus
 
00:53:02.710 --> 00:53:02.720 align:start position:0%
that were otherwise expecting to be off
 
00:53:04.549 --> 00:53:04.559 align:start position:0%
campus that was prohibited due to covid
 
00:53:06.230 --> 00:53:06.240 align:start position:0%
for travel abroad or what have you study
 
00:53:06.240 --> 00:53:07.270 align:start position:0%
for travel abroad or what have you study
abroad

00:53:07.270 --> 00:53:07.280 align:start position:0%
abroad
 
00:53:09.910 --> 00:53:09.920 align:start position:0%
that we had 500 additional students
 
00:53:12.230 --> 00:53:12.240 align:start position:0%
adding to our already very tight housing
 
00:53:12.240 --> 00:53:13.430 align:start position:0%
adding to our already very tight housing
market

00:53:13.430 --> 00:53:13.440 align:start position:0%
market
 
00:53:14.950 --> 00:53:14.960 align:start position:0%
i think the college and the hospital are
 
00:53:17.270 --> 00:53:17.280 align:start position:0%
taking steps to take big bites out of
 
00:53:20.390 --> 00:53:20.400 align:start position:0%
the problem by doing their own housing
 
00:53:23.109 --> 00:53:23.119 align:start position:0%
but again this is just another tool
 
00:53:25.829 --> 00:53:25.839 align:start position:0%
um and it's about people who can't find
 
00:53:28.710 --> 00:53:28.720 align:start position:0%
that because they're competing with
 
00:53:31.349 --> 00:53:31.359 align:start position:0%
students medical professionals etc we
 
00:53:33.589 --> 00:53:33.599 align:start position:0%
need all types of housing to solve the
 
00:53:33.599 --> 00:53:36.309 align:start position:0%
need all types of housing to solve the
problem

00:53:36.309 --> 00:53:36.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:38.230 --> 00:53:38.240 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you mr clem
 
00:53:40.950 --> 00:53:40.960 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
00:53:43.589 --> 00:53:43.599 align:start position:0%
i sit on the lebanon planning board as
 
00:53:45.190 --> 00:53:45.200 align:start position:0%
you may know
 
00:53:48.950 --> 00:53:48.960 align:start position:0%
and we um are under tremendous pressure
 
00:53:50.710 --> 00:53:50.720 align:start position:0%
for the reasons that representative
 
00:53:52.790 --> 00:53:52.800 align:start position:0%
manjuputi just mentioned
 
00:53:55.510 --> 00:53:55.520 align:start position:0%
to um
 
00:53:58.470 --> 00:53:58.480 align:start position:0%
to review and accept
 
00:54:00.069 --> 00:54:00.079 align:start position:0%
proposals for
 
00:54:04.710 --> 00:54:04.720 align:start position:0%
mega developments 200 400 500 unit
 
00:54:06.790 --> 00:54:06.800 align:start position:0%
apartment buildings
 
00:54:09.270 --> 00:54:09.280 align:start position:0%
do you think that if this bill were to
 
00:54:12.309 --> 00:54:12.319 align:start position:0%
become law that it would relieve some of
 
00:54:13.750 --> 00:54:13.760 align:start position:0%
that pressure
 
00:54:16.470 --> 00:54:16.480 align:start position:0%
on planning boards such as in lebanon
 
00:54:18.790 --> 00:54:18.800 align:start position:0%
where there is ample
 
00:54:21.109 --> 00:54:21.119 align:start position:0%
infrastructure water public water and
 
00:54:23.829 --> 00:54:23.839 align:start position:0%
sewer and there may be fewer of these
 
00:54:25.750 --> 00:54:25.760 align:start position:0%
large developments that come before
 
00:54:27.670 --> 00:54:27.680 align:start position:0%
planning boards and pose tremendous
 
00:54:30.870 --> 00:54:30.880 align:start position:0%
problems for us and more
 
00:54:33.349 --> 00:54:33.359 align:start position:0%
middle of the road housing
 
00:54:36.390 --> 00:54:36.400 align:start position:0%
i do i mean i i think when we have
 
00:54:38.230 --> 00:54:38.240 align:start position:0%
studies that show that our region is 10
 
00:54:38.240 --> 00:54:39.190 align:start position:0%
studies that show that our region is 10
000

00:54:39.190 --> 00:54:39.200 align:start position:0%
000
 
00:54:39.200 --> 00:54:40.230 align:start position:0%
000
um

00:54:40.230 --> 00:54:40.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:54:41.670 --> 00:54:41.680 align:start position:0%
units shy
 
00:54:43.990 --> 00:54:44.000 align:start position:0%
all housing is needed and i think part
 
00:54:45.510 --> 00:54:45.520 align:start position:0%
of the reason that lebanon is seeing so
 
00:54:47.750 --> 00:54:47.760 align:start position:0%
many big projects is because there's not
 
00:54:51.030 --> 00:54:51.040 align:start position:0%
an avenue right now for other types
 
00:54:53.510 --> 00:54:53.520 align:start position:0%
so yes i believe that opening up this
 
00:54:56.069 --> 00:54:56.079 align:start position:0%
typology that is not even on the table
 
00:54:58.309 --> 00:54:58.319 align:start position:0%
right now for me to apply to the
 
00:55:00.789 --> 00:55:00.799 align:start position:0%
planning board with creates a new avenue
 
00:55:02.630 --> 00:55:02.640 align:start position:0%
for investment capital to come in to try
 
00:55:04.950 --> 00:55:04.960 align:start position:0%
to solve the housing crisis so that you
 
00:55:07.109 --> 00:55:07.119 align:start position:0%
can't just take little bites
 
00:55:10.230 --> 00:55:10.240 align:start position:0%
one unit at a time often in subdivisions
 
00:55:11.270 --> 00:55:11.280 align:start position:0%
in green
 
00:55:14.390 --> 00:55:14.400 align:start position:0%
um greenfield development you can create
 
00:55:17.030 --> 00:55:17.040 align:start position:0%
interesting downtown typologies around
 
00:55:19.109 --> 00:55:19.119 align:start position:0%
our current two downtowns as we have in
 
00:55:19.119 --> 00:55:21.030 align:start position:0%
our current two downtowns as we have in
lebanon

00:55:21.030 --> 00:55:21.040 align:start position:0%
lebanon
 
00:55:23.030 --> 00:55:23.040 align:start position:0%
where you're not putting big buildings
 
00:55:25.349 --> 00:55:25.359 align:start position:0%
up on hills in the middle of
 
00:55:29.109 --> 00:55:29.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:31.990 --> 00:55:32.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you mr clem
 
00:55:34.390 --> 00:55:34.400 align:start position:0%
do you also think that it might
 
00:55:35.990 --> 00:55:36.000 align:start position:0%
relieve some
 
00:55:38.710 --> 00:55:38.720 align:start position:0%
pressure on our environment in new
 
00:55:38.720 --> 00:55:39.990 align:start position:0%
pressure on our environment in new
hampshire

00:55:39.990 --> 00:55:40.000 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
00:55:42.470 --> 00:55:42.480 align:start position:0%
where some of these major developments
 
00:55:45.349 --> 00:55:45.359 align:start position:0%
of 3 4 500 units
 
00:55:48.789 --> 00:55:48.799 align:start position:0%
are near wetlands or on wetlands or
 
00:55:51.190 --> 00:55:51.200 align:start position:0%
on on steep grades
 
00:55:51.200 --> 00:55:53.030 align:start position:0%
on on steep grades
where

00:55:53.030 --> 00:55:53.040 align:start position:0%
where
 
00:55:55.510 --> 00:55:55.520 align:start position:0%
building there really endangers the
 
00:55:57.349 --> 00:55:57.359 align:start position:0%
environment and the wildlife do you
 
00:55:59.670 --> 00:55:59.680 align:start position:0%
think that it could help preserve new
 
00:56:02.710 --> 00:56:02.720 align:start position:0%
hampshire's rural character
 
00:56:04.630 --> 00:56:04.640 align:start position:0%
absolutely and i speak as someone with
 
00:56:06.710 --> 00:56:06.720 align:start position:0%
an environmental policy degree uh who
 
00:56:08.630 --> 00:56:08.640 align:start position:0%
ended up in the development field
 
00:56:10.549 --> 00:56:10.559 align:start position:0%
um i think we're talking about
 
00:56:12.150 --> 00:56:12.160 align:start position:0%
development where development already
 
00:56:14.870 --> 00:56:14.880 align:start position:0%
exists with this bill this is an infill
 
00:56:17.030 --> 00:56:17.040 align:start position:0%
bill this is a downtown development bill
 
00:56:19.190 --> 00:56:19.200 align:start position:0%
this is the surrounding circles of our
 
00:56:20.390 --> 00:56:20.400 align:start position:0%
towns bill
 
00:56:22.470 --> 00:56:22.480 align:start position:0%
so yes i believe it pulls development
 
00:56:24.150 --> 00:56:24.160 align:start position:0%
back towards the city center where it
 
00:56:26.309 --> 00:56:26.319 align:start position:0%
should be as opposed to continuing to
 
00:56:28.150 --> 00:56:28.160 align:start position:0%
push it out to areas that could
 
00:56:30.870 --> 00:56:30.880 align:start position:0%
otherwise be left for other uses to
 
00:56:32.710 --> 00:56:32.720 align:start position:0%
enjoy the outdoor recreation for example
 
00:56:34.470 --> 00:56:34.480 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire
 
00:56:36.390 --> 00:56:36.400 align:start position:0%
next we're going to go to representative
 
00:56:38.630 --> 00:56:38.640 align:start position:0%
rong and then representative
 
00:56:41.030 --> 00:56:41.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr church
 
00:56:42.549 --> 00:56:42.559 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you mr
 
00:56:44.549 --> 00:56:44.559 align:start position:0%
clint for taking my question
 
00:56:44.559 --> 00:56:45.589 align:start position:0%
clint for taking my question
um

00:56:45.589 --> 00:56:45.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:56:48.150 --> 00:56:48.160 align:start position:0%
as far as your industry goes if this
 
00:56:50.470 --> 00:56:50.480 align:start position:0%
bill were to pass into law how would it
 
00:56:52.390 --> 00:56:52.400 align:start position:0%
affect that industry would it create
 
00:56:54.630 --> 00:56:54.640 align:start position:0%
like a niche area or would it be
 
00:56:57.990 --> 00:56:58.000 align:start position:0%
absorbed with current developers
 
00:57:00.150 --> 00:57:00.160 align:start position:0%
i think it opens a new niche for sure i
 
00:57:01.829 --> 00:57:01.839 align:start position:0%
mean this is a
 
00:57:04.230 --> 00:57:04.240 align:start position:0%
typology that i could walk into my local
 
00:57:06.309 --> 00:57:06.319 align:start position:0%
bank and we could scratch out on the
 
00:57:09.670 --> 00:57:09.680 align:start position:0%
desk in an afternoon as opposed to these
 
00:57:11.750 --> 00:57:11.760 align:start position:0%
large-scale developments that have
 
00:57:14.150 --> 00:57:14.160 align:start position:0%
enormous calls for capital large
 
00:57:16.630 --> 00:57:16.640 align:start position:0%
permitting challenges etc this is
 
00:57:18.470 --> 00:57:18.480 align:start position:0%
something that creates fast-track
 
00:57:20.150 --> 00:57:20.160 align:start position:0%
housing growth which i think is
 
00:57:22.150 --> 00:57:22.160 align:start position:0%
important i don't know who decides to
 
00:57:24.630 --> 00:57:24.640 align:start position:0%
play in this space i don't think it
 
00:57:26.630 --> 00:57:26.640 align:start position:0%
likely becomes attractive to the big
 
00:57:28.230 --> 00:57:28.240 align:start position:0%
developers who are pushing for the
 
00:57:29.510 --> 00:57:29.520 align:start position:0%
larger units
 
00:57:31.750 --> 00:57:31.760 align:start position:0%
i think to representative van's point it
 
00:57:34.150 --> 00:57:34.160 align:start position:0%
allows people like representative anne
 
00:57:36.549 --> 00:57:36.559 align:start position:0%
to to turn their house and from over a
 
00:57:39.270 --> 00:57:39.280 align:start position:0%
size into a four unit or propose smaller
 
00:57:41.430 --> 00:57:41.440 align:start position:0%
stuff or take those contractors who have
 
00:57:43.670 --> 00:57:43.680 align:start position:0%
the capabilities to build this and give
 
00:57:45.109 --> 00:57:45.119 align:start position:0%
them something that
 
00:57:47.270 --> 00:57:47.280 align:start position:0%
they with their small business can go
 
00:57:50.549 --> 00:57:50.559 align:start position:0%
ahead and do profitably without seeing
 
00:57:52.549 --> 00:57:52.559 align:start position:0%
nothing but red flags and obstructions
 
00:57:54.470 --> 00:57:54.480 align:start position:0%
if they were to try to take this to the
 
00:57:57.910 --> 00:57:57.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:00.309 --> 00:58:00.319 align:start position:0%
so it would um i guess on turn it would
 
00:58:02.470 --> 00:58:02.480 align:start position:0%
it would create a specialization among
 
00:58:04.630 --> 00:58:04.640 align:start position:0%
developers and contractors
 
00:58:07.349 --> 00:58:07.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:07.359 --> 00:58:08.630 align:start position:0%
 
perhaps

00:58:08.630 --> 00:58:08.640 align:start position:0%
perhaps
 
00:58:10.230 --> 00:58:10.240 align:start position:0%
i mean i i think it's
 
00:58:12.710 --> 00:58:12.720 align:start position:0%
it's another possibility i don't know
 
00:58:14.950 --> 00:58:14.960 align:start position:0%
that they would specialize solely in it
 
00:58:17.190 --> 00:58:17.200 align:start position:0%
i think it's so specific to
 
00:58:19.030 --> 00:58:19.040 align:start position:0%
who the what their skill set is what
 
00:58:21.270 --> 00:58:21.280 align:start position:0%
their access to capital is i think when
 
00:58:22.710 --> 00:58:22.720 align:start position:0%
you look at the conversation that's
 
00:58:24.950 --> 00:58:24.960 align:start position:0%
happening around this nationwide and
 
00:58:26.309 --> 00:58:26.319 align:start position:0%
we're seeing
 
00:58:26.319 --> 00:58:27.510 align:start position:0%
we're seeing
uh

00:58:27.510 --> 00:58:27.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:58:29.510 --> 00:58:29.520 align:start position:0%
federally and financially approved
 
00:58:29.520 --> 00:58:30.549 align:start position:0%
federally and financially approved
housing

00:58:30.549 --> 00:58:30.559 align:start position:0%
housing
 
00:58:32.789 --> 00:58:32.799 align:start position:0%
that we just can't do here at the state
 
00:58:32.799 --> 00:58:33.750 align:start position:0%
that we just can't do here at the state
level

00:58:33.750 --> 00:58:33.760 align:start position:0%
level
 
00:58:35.349 --> 00:58:35.359 align:start position:0%
yes i think we're just missing
 
00:58:37.990 --> 00:58:38.000 align:start position:0%
opportunities right now because we don't
 
00:58:39.829 --> 00:58:39.839 align:start position:0%
have legislation like this to exist that
 
00:58:42.390 --> 00:58:42.400 align:start position:0%
says hey here is a logical path to get
 
00:58:44.870 --> 00:58:44.880 align:start position:0%
to housing that is time tested and
 
00:58:46.470 --> 00:58:46.480 align:start position:0%
proven in the state of new hampshire
 
00:58:46.480 --> 00:58:47.510 align:start position:0%
proven in the state of new hampshire
already

00:58:47.510 --> 00:58:47.520 align:start position:0%
already
 
00:58:49.589 --> 00:58:49.599 align:start position:0%

thank you so much chair it's a pleasure

to be here for the record my name is
 
01:00:03.750 --> 01:00:03.760 align:start position:0%
representative rebecca mcwilliams i
 
01:00:06.150 --> 01:00:06.160 align:start position:0%
represent the west side of concord so
 
01:00:08.230 --> 01:00:08.240 align:start position:0%
the legislative office building is in
 
01:00:10.069 --> 01:00:10.079 align:start position:0%
one of my districts it's a pleasure to
 
01:00:13.109 --> 01:00:13.119 align:start position:0%
host you all in my district today
 
01:00:15.510 --> 01:00:15.520 align:start position:0%
i'm here to speak about the younger
 
01:00:17.910 --> 01:00:17.920 align:start position:0%
generation and i'm sure this is not news
 
01:00:19.190 --> 01:00:19.200 align:start position:0%
to you
 
01:00:21.510 --> 01:00:21.520 align:start position:0%
but as an architect actively working in
 
01:00:22.789 --> 01:00:22.799 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
01:00:25.109 --> 01:00:25.119 align:start position:0%
and often my clients are
 
01:00:26.950 --> 01:00:26.960 align:start position:0%
in their 20s and 30s
 
01:00:28.950 --> 01:00:28.960 align:start position:0%
looking to do a renovation project just
 
01:00:31.109 --> 01:00:31.119 align:start position:0%
to give you a little bit of background
 
01:00:33.510 --> 01:00:33.520 align:start position:0%
so as a younger person in new hampshire
 
01:00:35.190 --> 01:00:35.200 align:start position:0%
i will tell you that there is a huge
 
01:00:37.109 --> 01:00:37.119 align:start position:0%
amount of demand
 
01:00:37.119 --> 01:00:37.829 align:start position:0%
amount of demand
for

01:00:37.829 --> 01:00:37.839 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:00:40.309 --> 01:00:40.319 align:start position:0%
housing that includes more than one
 
01:00:42.150 --> 01:00:42.160 align:start position:0%
space and i will tell you that these
 
01:00:44.230 --> 01:00:44.240 align:start position:0%
very popular three and four family even
 
01:00:46.069 --> 01:00:46.079 align:start position:0%
duplexes in our downtowns in new
 
01:00:49.430 --> 01:00:49.440 align:start position:0%
hampshire are the hottest commodity for
 
01:00:52.069 --> 01:00:52.079 align:start position:0%
young folks to buy and renovate and then
 
01:00:53.990 --> 01:00:54.000 align:start position:0%
live in one side rent out the other i
 
01:00:55.910 --> 01:00:55.920 align:start position:0%
mean that is just the gold standard
 
01:00:57.430 --> 01:00:57.440 align:start position:0%
that's what young people are looking to
 
01:00:57.440 --> 01:00:58.150 align:start position:0%
that's what young people are looking to
do

01:00:58.150 --> 01:00:58.160 align:start position:0%
do
 
01:00:59.750 --> 01:00:59.760 align:start position:0%
generally when they get to new hampshire
 
01:01:01.190 --> 01:01:01.200 align:start position:0%
and they decide they want to purchase
 
01:01:03.349 --> 01:01:03.359 align:start position:0%
something hire an architect hire a
 
01:01:05.270 --> 01:01:05.280 align:start position:0%
contractor renovate make it work
 
01:01:05.280 --> 01:01:06.710 align:start position:0%
contractor renovate make it work
financially

01:01:06.710 --> 01:01:06.720 align:start position:0%
financially
 
01:01:06.720 --> 01:01:07.589 align:start position:0%
financially
so

01:01:07.589 --> 01:01:07.599 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:01:10.630 --> 01:01:10.640 align:start position:0%
what we have here is a lot of existing
 
01:01:12.630 --> 01:01:12.640 align:start position:0%
wonderful buildings beautiful historic
 
01:01:14.789 --> 01:01:14.799 align:start position:0%
downtowns the young people are coming in
 
01:01:15.990 --> 01:01:16.000 align:start position:0%
and they're willing to spend the money
 
01:01:17.109 --> 01:01:17.119 align:start position:0%
and renovate
 
01:01:19.430 --> 01:01:19.440 align:start position:0%
but we also have these missing teeth in
 
01:01:20.870 --> 01:01:20.880 align:start position:0%
our downtowns
 
01:01:22.549 --> 01:01:22.559 align:start position:0%
we have empty lots
 
01:01:24.390 --> 01:01:24.400 align:start position:0%
we have derelict buildings that really
 
01:01:26.470 --> 01:01:26.480 align:start position:0%
should be torn down but if we were to
 
01:01:28.230 --> 01:01:28.240 align:start position:0%
tear them down then we wouldn't be able
 
01:01:29.990 --> 01:01:30.000 align:start position:0%
to build per zoning what was there
 
01:01:31.829 --> 01:01:31.839 align:start position:0%
before unless it gets grandfathered on a
 
01:01:33.430 --> 01:01:33.440 align:start position:0%
town-by-town basis
 
01:01:34.870 --> 01:01:34.880 align:start position:0%
so what we're talking about with this
 
01:01:37.430 --> 01:01:37.440 align:start position:0%
bill is actually revitalizing and coming
 
01:01:39.510 --> 01:01:39.520 align:start position:0%
back to what worked for our zoning codes
 
01:01:41.109 --> 01:01:41.119 align:start position:0%
pre-world war ii
 
01:01:42.470 --> 01:01:42.480 align:start position:0%
and it worked well we had walkable
 
01:01:44.789 --> 01:01:44.799 align:start position:0%
downtowns we still do but we also have
 
01:01:46.870 --> 01:01:46.880 align:start position:0%
these missing teeth so this bill solves
 
01:01:49.270 --> 01:01:49.280 align:start position:0%
a problem for the next generation for
 
01:01:51.910 --> 01:01:51.920 align:start position:0%
what is really an opportunity a business
 
01:01:53.829 --> 01:01:53.839 align:start position:0%
opportunity for an individual or a
 
01:01:55.910 --> 01:01:55.920 align:start position:0%
couple to buy and make some money and
 
01:01:57.430 --> 01:01:57.440 align:start position:0%
build a nest egg and maybe save for
 
01:01:59.510 --> 01:01:59.520 align:start position:0%
their children's future and this is the
 
01:02:01.029 --> 01:02:01.039 align:start position:0%
kind of housing that we really should be
 
01:02:02.309 --> 01:02:02.319 align:start position:0%
looking at for the future of new
 
01:02:04.829 --> 01:02:04.839 align:start position:0%
hampshire so with that i'm happy to take
 
01:02:06.309 --> 01:02:06.319 align:start position:0%
questions anyone have a question for the
 
01:02:08.309 --> 01:02:08.319 align:start position:0%
representative let's start with uh
 
01:02:11.029 --> 01:02:11.039 align:start position:0%
representatives davis
 
01:02:12.549 --> 01:02:12.559 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
01:02:16.069 --> 01:02:16.079 align:start position:0%
taking my question representative
 
01:02:17.910 --> 01:02:17.920 align:start position:0%
i'm going to go back to my experience on
 
01:02:19.510 --> 01:02:19.520 align:start position:0%
the lebanon planning book for just a
 
01:02:19.520 --> 01:02:21.670 align:start position:0%
the lebanon planning book for just a
moment

01:02:21.670 --> 01:02:21.680 align:start position:0%
moment
 
01:02:23.910 --> 01:02:23.920 align:start position:0%
the very large developments that we're
 
01:02:27.029 --> 01:02:27.039 align:start position:0%
seeing come before us
 
01:02:29.510 --> 01:02:29.520 align:start position:0%
i would say eight times out of ten
 
01:02:29.520 --> 01:02:31.150 align:start position:0%
i would say eight times out of ten
are

01:02:31.150 --> 01:02:31.160 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:02:31.160 --> 01:02:32.710 align:start position:0%
are
conceptualized

01:02:32.710 --> 01:02:32.720 align:start position:0%
conceptualized
 
01:02:35.190 --> 01:02:35.200 align:start position:0%
developed and managed by companies that
 
01:02:37.190 --> 01:02:37.200 align:start position:0%
are not in new hampshire
 
01:02:39.430 --> 01:02:39.440 align:start position:0%
they're in massachusetts they're in
 
01:02:41.750 --> 01:02:41.760 align:start position:0%
delaware they're in
 
01:02:43.589 --> 01:02:43.599 align:start position:0%
other places
 
01:02:44.950 --> 01:02:44.960 align:start position:0%
do you think
 
01:02:47.190 --> 01:02:47.200 align:start position:0%
that if this bill became law
 
01:02:48.950 --> 01:02:48.960 align:start position:0%
it would stimulate
 
01:02:51.029 --> 01:02:51.039 align:start position:0%
new hampshire business
 
01:02:53.910 --> 01:02:53.920 align:start position:0%
in other words local contractors local
 
01:02:53.920 --> 01:02:55.510 align:start position:0%
in other words local contractors local
developers

01:02:55.510 --> 01:02:55.520 align:start position:0%
developers
 
01:02:59.029 --> 01:02:59.039 align:start position:0%
local plumbers local carpenters in ways
 
01:03:01.910 --> 01:03:01.920 align:start position:0%
that these large buildings just cannot
 
01:03:01.920 --> 01:03:03.190 align:start position:0%
that these large buildings just cannot
do

01:03:03.190 --> 01:03:03.200 align:start position:0%
do
 
01:03:05.430 --> 01:03:05.440 align:start position:0%
that's a great question representative
 
01:03:07.990 --> 01:03:08.000 align:start position:0%
let me parse that out a little bit
 
01:03:09.589 --> 01:03:09.599 align:start position:0%
when we're talking about really large
 
01:03:09.599 --> 01:03:11.190 align:start position:0%
when we're talking about really large
developments

01:03:11.190 --> 01:03:11.200 align:start position:0%
developments
 
01:03:13.910 --> 01:03:13.920 align:start position:0%
often times the money flows out of state
 
01:03:15.990 --> 01:03:16.000 align:start position:0%
once it's completed so we are talking
 
01:03:17.589 --> 01:03:17.599 align:start position:0%
about local jobs for a short period of
 
01:03:19.670 --> 01:03:19.680 align:start position:0%
time one to two years
 
01:03:21.270 --> 01:03:21.280 align:start position:0%
for getting through the permitting
 
01:03:23.349 --> 01:03:23.359 align:start position:0%
process and for doing the construction
 
01:03:23.359 --> 01:03:24.230 align:start position:0%
process and for doing the construction
work

01:03:24.230 --> 01:03:24.240 align:start position:0%
work
 
01:03:25.750 --> 01:03:25.760 align:start position:0%
but oftentimes
 
01:03:27.270 --> 01:03:27.280 align:start position:0%
especially if it's a local developer
 
01:03:29.109 --> 01:03:29.119 align:start position:0%
they will bring in their own crew from
 
01:03:30.630 --> 01:03:30.640 align:start position:0%
out of state so if you're seeing a lot
 
01:03:32.390 --> 01:03:32.400 align:start position:0%
of massachusetts developers they may
 
01:03:34.549 --> 01:03:34.559 align:start position:0%
have their own cast of characters that
 
01:03:35.990 --> 01:03:36.000 align:start position:0%
are willing to drive up to new hampshire
 
01:03:38.789 --> 01:03:38.799 align:start position:0%
to do the development for a year or two
 
01:03:40.950 --> 01:03:40.960 align:start position:0%
so we do have local talent we have
 
01:03:42.470 --> 01:03:42.480 align:start position:0%
excellent trades people here in new
 
01:03:44.549 --> 01:03:44.559 align:start position:0%
hampshire and right now we're in a
 
01:03:46.630 --> 01:03:46.640 align:start position:0%
building boom they're they're very busy
 
01:03:48.789 --> 01:03:48.799 align:start position:0%
right now what this bill does is it
 
01:03:51.829 --> 01:03:51.839 align:start position:0%
codifies into law and opportunity for
 
01:03:55.109 --> 01:03:55.119 align:start position:0%
folks to help out on these very small
 
01:03:57.910 --> 01:03:57.920 align:start position:0%
infield projects in perpetuity so there
 
01:04:00.150 --> 01:04:00.160 align:start position:0%
will always be work for your local
 
01:04:02.870 --> 01:04:02.880 align:start position:0%
trades people we instead of having these
 
01:04:05.349 --> 01:04:05.359 align:start position:0%
you know 10-year building boom and then
 
01:04:07.190 --> 01:04:07.200 align:start position:0%
10-year building bust which is generally
 
01:04:09.349 --> 01:04:09.359 align:start position:0%
how the cycle goes we're talking about
 
01:04:11.349 --> 01:04:11.359 align:start position:0%
always having an opportunity at small
 
01:04:13.670 --> 01:04:13.680 align:start position:0%
scale to fill in and do a four or five
 
01:04:16.710 --> 01:04:16.720 align:start position:0%
month carpentry project to do work here
 
01:04:18.069 --> 01:04:18.079 align:start position:0%
locally in new hampshire and i think
 
01:04:19.670 --> 01:04:19.680 align:start position:0%
that's huge in terms of supporting the
 
01:04:21.589 --> 01:04:21.599 align:start position:0%
trades and i think that that's very
 
01:04:23.670 --> 01:04:23.680 align:start position:0%
important for the long term because we
 
01:04:25.670 --> 01:04:25.680 align:start position:0%
often lose really quality talented
 
01:04:28.470 --> 01:04:28.480 align:start position:0%
people to go south to the boston market
 
01:04:30.549 --> 01:04:30.559 align:start position:0%
right we have excellent plumbers and
 
01:04:32.630 --> 01:04:32.640 align:start position:0%
excellent pipefitters and they end up
 
01:04:34.549 --> 01:04:34.559 align:start position:0%
taking jobs elsewhere because there just
 
01:04:36.470 --> 01:04:36.480 align:start position:0%
isn't enough chance here when the market
 
01:04:39.029 --> 01:04:39.039 align:start position:0%
isn't hot like it is right now
 
01:04:41.270 --> 01:04:41.280 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
01:04:42.630 --> 01:04:42.640 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you
 
01:04:44.950 --> 01:04:44.960 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
 
01:04:46.549 --> 01:04:46.559 align:start position:0%
would you um
 
01:04:49.109 --> 01:04:49.119 align:start position:0%
being an architect would you believe
 
01:04:53.829 --> 01:04:53.839 align:start position:0%
that this not only creates more job
 
01:04:56.069 --> 01:04:56.079 align:start position:0%
not just job opportunities for local
 
01:04:59.589 --> 01:04:59.599 align:start position:0%
talents to pull together but also this
 
01:05:03.109 --> 01:05:03.119 align:start position:0%
is ownership is local right it's small
 
01:05:05.510 --> 01:05:05.520 align:start position:0%
enough that young people can afford to
 
01:05:05.520 --> 01:05:06.630 align:start position:0%
enough that young people can afford to
buy

01:05:06.630 --> 01:05:06.640 align:start position:0%
buy
 
01:05:09.670 --> 01:05:09.680 align:start position:0%
and renovated so the
 
01:05:12.470 --> 01:05:12.480 align:start position:0%
development as well as the investment
 
01:05:15.829 --> 01:05:15.839 align:start position:0%
and the benefit stays within the state
 
01:05:17.270 --> 01:05:17.280 align:start position:0%
would you believe that
 
01:05:19.109 --> 01:05:19.119 align:start position:0%
i would i think this is reinventing the
 
01:05:20.950 --> 01:05:20.960 align:start position:0%
american dream i think we're talking
 
01:05:23.670 --> 01:05:23.680 align:start position:0%
about getting back to 2.5 kids a picket
 
01:05:25.670 --> 01:05:25.680 align:start position:0%
fence and a dog and giving that
 
01:05:27.270 --> 01:05:27.280 align:start position:0%
opportunity to the next generation here
 
01:05:28.549 --> 01:05:28.559 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire i think it's that
 
01:05:28.559 --> 01:05:30.390 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire i think it's that
important

01:05:30.390 --> 01:05:30.400 align:start position:0%
important
 
01:05:30.400 --> 01:05:32.870 align:start position:0%
important
representative

01:05:32.870 --> 01:05:32.880 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:05:34.789 --> 01:05:34.799 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you for taking
 
01:05:38.069 --> 01:05:38.079 align:start position:0%
my question representative van made a
 
01:05:39.670 --> 01:05:39.680 align:start position:0%
comment that
 
01:05:41.829 --> 01:05:41.839 align:start position:0%
this is
 
01:05:45.589 --> 01:05:45.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:48.390 --> 01:05:48.400 align:start position:0%
how housing is done by
 
01:05:50.630 --> 01:05:50.640 align:start position:0%
removing from local control to state
 
01:05:50.640 --> 01:05:53.349 align:start position:0%
removing from local control to state
control

01:05:53.349 --> 01:05:53.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:55.510 --> 01:05:55.520 align:start position:0%
do you believe that there is anything
 
01:05:58.390 --> 01:05:58.400 align:start position:0%
that is preventing
 
01:06:01.349 --> 01:06:01.359 align:start position:0%
cities towns and counties from changing
 
01:06:03.750 --> 01:06:03.760 align:start position:0%
their zoning to permit that this on
 
01:06:05.349 --> 01:06:05.359 align:start position:0%
their own
 
01:06:07.349 --> 01:06:07.359 align:start position:0%
i do
 
01:06:09.829 --> 01:06:09.839 align:start position:0%
i believe that cities towns and counties
 
01:06:12.230 --> 01:06:12.240 align:start position:0%
have really stumbled over making massive
 
01:06:13.510 --> 01:06:13.520 align:start position:0%
change on their own because they're
 
01:06:15.029 --> 01:06:15.039 align:start position:0%
waiting to see what the joneses are
 
01:06:16.309 --> 01:06:16.319 align:start position:0%
doing nearby
 
01:06:17.990 --> 01:06:18.000 align:start position:0%
i think we've had tiny incremental
 
01:06:19.910 --> 01:06:19.920 align:start position:0%
change in some more
 
01:06:22.549 --> 01:06:22.559 align:start position:0%
open to change communities but at the
 
01:06:24.390 --> 01:06:24.400 align:start position:0%
level that we need to make change in
 
01:06:26.390 --> 01:06:26.400 align:start position:0%
order to house the next generation i
 
01:06:28.230 --> 01:06:28.240 align:start position:0%
don't see an individual town stepping
 
01:06:31.190 --> 01:06:31.200 align:start position:0%
forward and doing something as
 
01:06:37.109 --> 01:06:37.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:39.109 --> 01:06:39.119 align:start position:0%
that was a great answer
 
01:06:39.119 --> 01:06:41.109 align:start position:0%
that was a great answer
but

01:06:41.109 --> 01:06:41.119 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:06:42.549 --> 01:06:42.559 align:start position:0%
i don't believe it
 
01:06:45.029 --> 01:06:45.039 align:start position:0%
answers my question
 
01:06:47.510 --> 01:06:47.520 align:start position:0%
my question was is there anything that
 
01:06:49.670 --> 01:06:49.680 align:start position:0%
is preventing
 
01:06:51.750 --> 01:06:51.760 align:start position:0%
uh say a state law
 
01:06:51.760 --> 01:06:52.789 align:start position:0%
uh say a state law
towns

01:06:52.789 --> 01:06:52.799 align:start position:0%
towns
 
01:06:55.270 --> 01:06:55.280 align:start position:0%
cities or counties from changing or
 
01:06:58.470 --> 01:06:58.480 align:start position:0%
zoning to accommodate this kind of idea
 
01:06:59.990 --> 01:07:00.000 align:start position:0%
if you're asking structurally if there
 
01:07:02.150 --> 01:07:02.160 align:start position:0%
is a state law that prevents cities and
 
01:07:04.309 --> 01:07:04.319 align:start position:0%
towns from setting up their own zoning
 
01:07:05.990 --> 01:07:06.000 align:start position:0%
is that is that the question am i not
 
01:07:08.950 --> 01:07:08.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:10.870 --> 01:07:10.880 align:start position:0%
can the
 
01:07:12.870 --> 01:07:12.880 align:start position:0%
town or city or county
 
01:07:18.789 --> 01:07:18.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:22.950 --> 01:07:22.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:25.270 --> 01:07:25.280 align:start position:0%
structurally there's nothing preventing
 
01:07:26.829 --> 01:07:26.839 align:start position:0%
them structurally
 
01:07:29.190 --> 01:07:29.200 align:start position:0%
politically all the time that's why
 
01:07:30.710 --> 01:07:30.720 align:start position:0%
we're here in this situation it's been
 
01:07:32.309 --> 01:07:32.319 align:start position:0%
40 years of no change
 
01:07:33.910 --> 01:07:33.920 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:07:36.309 --> 01:07:36.319 align:start position:0%
yes at this point uh
 
01:07:38.150 --> 01:07:38.160 align:start position:0%
i want to thank you for your testimony
 
01:07:38.160 --> 01:07:40.150 align:start position:0%
i want to thank you for your testimony

01:07:42.950 --> 01:07:42.960 align:start position:0%
and being patient with our schedule
 
01:07:45.510 --> 01:07:45.520 align:start position:0%
next we'd like to hear from ms lilly
 
01:07:52.710 --> 01:07:52.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:54.950 --> 01:07:54.960 align:start position:0%
yeah my name is lily beyer
 
01:07:58.710 --> 01:07:58.720 align:start position:0%
i am in fact ivy's daughter um but i'm
 
01:08:00.150 --> 01:08:00.160 align:start position:0%
here because
 
01:08:01.750 --> 01:08:01.760 align:start position:0%
i am
 
01:08:03.990 --> 01:08:04.000 align:start position:0%
uh interested in the built environment i
 
01:08:06.069 --> 01:08:06.079 align:start position:0%
am a young person who is living in one
 
01:08:08.309 --> 01:08:08.319 align:start position:0%
of these buildings i'm also a structural
 
01:08:11.190 --> 01:08:11.200 align:start position:0%
engineer so that by trade i have some
 
01:08:12.630 --> 01:08:12.640 align:start position:0%
interest in the built environment in
 
01:08:14.309 --> 01:08:14.319 align:start position:0%
general this isn't something that's
 
01:08:15.910 --> 01:08:15.920 align:start position:0%
probably going to affect my workforce
 
01:08:18.070 --> 01:08:18.080 align:start position:0%
flow particularly we tend to work on
 
01:08:20.550 --> 01:08:20.560 align:start position:0%
those big 200 unit projects
 
01:08:22.630 --> 01:08:22.640 align:start position:0%
um however
 
01:08:24.870 --> 01:08:24.880 align:start position:0%
this is where i live i live in
 
01:08:27.910 --> 01:08:27.920 align:start position:0%

house which is a triple it's my landlady
 
01:08:47.110 --> 01:08:47.120 align:start position:0%
lives on one side i live on the other
 
01:08:49.189 --> 01:08:49.199 align:start position:0%
side i have a downstairs neighbor
 
01:08:50.789 --> 01:08:50.799 align:start position:0%
so there's two tenants and the building
 
01:08:53.189 --> 01:08:53.199 align:start position:0%
owner and
 
01:08:55.590 --> 01:08:55.600 align:start position:0%
walking down richards avenue it's one of
 
01:08:57.430 --> 01:08:57.440 align:start position:0%
the best streets in town
 
01:08:57.440 --> 01:08:58.789 align:start position:0%
the best streets in town
and

01:08:58.789 --> 01:08:58.799 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:09:00.309 --> 01:09:00.319 align:start position:0%
we can't
 
01:09:02.789 --> 01:09:02.799 align:start position:0%
always build that and this is something
 
01:09:05.590 --> 01:09:05.600 align:start position:0%
that a lot of places adding a couple of
 
01:09:08.229 --> 01:09:08.239 align:start position:0%
units inside an existing structure no
 
01:09:10.709 --> 01:09:10.719 align:start position:0%
one's gonna know walking down the street
 
01:09:13.030 --> 01:09:13.040 align:start position:0%
you don't know you just see a place
 
01:09:14.470 --> 01:09:14.480 align:start position:0%
that's vibrant
 
01:09:17.110 --> 01:09:17.120 align:start position:0%
and has people outside walking their
 
01:09:17.120 --> 01:09:18.149 align:start position:0%
and has people outside walking their
dogs

01:09:18.149 --> 01:09:18.159 align:start position:0%
dogs
 
01:09:21.510 --> 01:09:21.520 align:start position:0%
and a place that people want to live
 
01:09:23.510 --> 01:09:23.520 align:start position:0%
people like me we want to live stumbling
 
01:09:25.510 --> 01:09:25.520 align:start position:0%
home from the bar distance we want to
 
01:09:27.510 --> 01:09:27.520 align:start position:0%
live walk to the coffee shop and see my
 
01:09:30.870 --> 01:09:30.880 align:start position:0%
friends distance we want to live in town
 
01:09:30.880 --> 01:09:32.149 align:start position:0%
friends distance we want to live in town
and

01:09:32.149 --> 01:09:32.159 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:09:34.550 --> 01:09:34.560 align:start position:0%
one of the problems is because so many
 
01:09:37.349 --> 01:09:37.359 align:start position:0%
people want to live in town if we don't
 
01:09:40.070 --> 01:09:40.080 align:start position:0%
do this kind of thing no change is not
 
01:09:42.950 --> 01:09:42.960 align:start position:0%
an option what we get is increased
 
01:09:45.110 --> 01:09:45.120 align:start position:0%
prices because people want to build that
 
01:09:46.390 --> 01:09:46.400 align:start position:0%
to live there
 
01:09:49.030 --> 01:09:49.040 align:start position:0%
and if we sit on our hands
 
01:09:50.709 --> 01:09:50.719 align:start position:0%
and do nothing
 
01:09:53.110 --> 01:09:53.120 align:start position:0%
everything gets more expensive and
 
01:09:55.350 --> 01:09:55.360 align:start position:0%
people like me people like my friends
 
01:09:57.990 --> 01:09:58.000 align:start position:0%
who want to live in town they can't
 
01:10:00.229 --> 01:10:00.239 align:start position:0%
because they can't afford to
 
01:10:03.430 --> 01:10:03.440 align:start position:0%
whereas if we allow and in fact
 
01:10:05.189 --> 01:10:05.199 align:start position:0%
make it easier
 
01:10:07.830 --> 01:10:07.840 align:start position:0%
for more units like the one i live in to
 
01:10:09.270 --> 01:10:09.280 align:start position:0%
be built
 
01:10:12.070 --> 01:10:12.080 align:start position:0%
that's how we make more space for the
 
01:10:14.830 --> 01:10:14.840 align:start position:0%
people who want to be here
 
01:10:18.390 --> 01:10:18.400 align:start position:0%
so saying well this is a big change
 
01:10:20.790 --> 01:10:20.800 align:start position:0%
that's not really true because doing
 
01:10:24.470 --> 01:10:24.480 align:start position:0%
nothing is a big change doing nothing
 
01:10:28.149 --> 01:10:28.159 align:start position:0%
it's easy it feels safe but it doesn't
 
01:10:30.709 --> 01:10:30.719 align:start position:0%
actually result in no change it results
 
01:10:32.950 --> 01:10:32.960 align:start position:0%
in increased prices
 
01:10:35.270 --> 01:10:35.280 align:start position:0%
lower supply as
 
01:10:35.280 --> 01:10:36.229 align:start position:0%
lower supply as
people

01:10:36.229 --> 01:10:36.239 align:start position:0%
people
 
01:10:36.239 --> 01:10:37.270 align:start position:0%
people
can't

01:10:37.270 --> 01:10:37.280 align:start position:0%
can't
 
01:10:39.510 --> 01:10:39.520 align:start position:0%
turn their large single family house
 
01:10:41.990 --> 01:10:42.000 align:start position:0%
into a couple of units that could be
 
01:10:44.310 --> 01:10:44.320 align:start position:0%
rented i'm a renter i've been a renter
 
01:10:46.550 --> 01:10:46.560 align:start position:0%
in the same address for the last eight
 
01:10:49.189 --> 01:10:49.199 align:start position:0%
years i'm a member of my community
 
01:10:51.830 --> 01:10:51.840 align:start position:0%
saying renters don't really belong here
 
01:10:54.310 --> 01:10:54.320 align:start position:0%
renters don't really participate that's
 
01:10:57.350 --> 01:10:57.360 align:start position:0%
not true either we're here we matter
 
01:10:59.350 --> 01:10:59.360 align:start position:0%
and we're part of the community and this
 
01:11:01.830 --> 01:11:01.840 align:start position:0%
is the kind of place that we want to
 
01:11:01.840 --> 01:11:02.630 align:start position:0%
is the kind of place that we want to
live

01:11:02.630 --> 01:11:02.640 align:start position:0%
live
 
01:11:05.590 --> 01:11:05.600 align:start position:0%
we want to live within our community we
 
01:11:07.510 --> 01:11:07.520 align:start position:0%
don't want to live in the big
 
01:11:09.910 --> 01:11:09.920 align:start position:0%
multi-family 200 unit apartment
 
01:11:12.390 --> 01:11:12.400 align:start position:0%
complexes we do because that's what's
 
01:11:12.400 --> 01:11:13.270 align:start position:0%
complexes we do because that's what's
there

01:11:13.270 --> 01:11:13.280 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:11:16.470 --> 01:11:16.480 align:start position:0%
but that's not what we really want
 
01:11:19.510 --> 01:11:19.520 align:start position:0%
and this is a bill that allows the kind
 
01:11:22.070 --> 01:11:22.080 align:start position:0%
of places that people want to be to
 
01:11:24.950 --> 01:11:24.960 align:start position:0%
happen i work on those big buildings but
 
01:11:26.550 --> 01:11:26.560 align:start position:0%
that's not where i live
 
01:11:29.350 --> 01:11:29.360 align:start position:0%
and that's not where my people live
 
01:11:31.350 --> 01:11:31.360 align:start position:0%
so this this is something that's super
 
01:11:35.270 --> 01:11:35.280 align:start position:0%
important and it will allow the places
 
01:11:38.070 --> 01:11:38.080 align:start position:0%
we love to continue to be the places we
 
01:11:40.709 --> 01:11:40.719 align:start position:0%
love and not just
 
01:11:43.110 --> 01:11:43.120 align:start position:0%
the people who have the money
 
01:11:45.270 --> 01:11:45.280 align:start position:0%
we don't have a lot of money typically
 
01:11:47.110 --> 01:11:47.120 align:start position:0%
in my generation we have a lot of
 
01:11:50.310 --> 01:11:50.320 align:start position:0%
student loans so living someplace that's
 
01:11:50.320 --> 01:11:52.229 align:start position:0%
student loans so living someplace that's
smaller

01:11:52.229 --> 01:11:52.239 align:start position:0%
smaller
 
01:11:53.910 --> 01:11:53.920 align:start position:0%
that's where we want to be i live in a
 
01:11:56.070 --> 01:11:56.080 align:start position:0%
building that has no parking it has
 
01:11:59.910 --> 01:11:59.920 align:start position:0%
three four adults with cars not a single
 
01:12:02.550 --> 01:12:02.560 align:start position:0%
parking space and it's okay we park on
 
01:12:04.709 --> 01:12:04.719 align:start position:0%
the street when it snows we move to city
 
01:12:04.719 --> 01:12:05.830 align:start position:0%
the street when it snows we move to city
hall

01:12:05.830 --> 01:12:05.840 align:start position:0%
hall
 
01:12:08.550 --> 01:12:08.560 align:start position:0%
or down the street there's a lot there
 
01:12:11.110 --> 01:12:11.120 align:start position:0%
are ways for this to exist
 
01:12:13.669 --> 01:12:13.679 align:start position:0%
without it being a problem
 
01:12:15.750 --> 01:12:15.760 align:start position:0%
and that's what we want
 
01:12:17.910 --> 01:12:17.920 align:start position:0%
i thank you for your testimony questions
 
01:12:19.990 --> 01:12:20.000 align:start position:0%
from the committee
 
01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:22.790 align:start position:0%
from the committee
miss

01:12:22.790 --> 01:12:22.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:26.390 --> 01:12:26.400 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um thank you uh for
 
01:12:28.390 --> 01:12:28.400 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
01:12:28.400 --> 01:12:29.270 align:start position:0%
taking my question
if

01:12:29.270 --> 01:12:29.280 align:start position:0%
if
 
01:12:32.149 --> 01:12:32.159 align:start position:0%
you i mean when you moved in
 
01:12:34.470 --> 01:12:34.480 align:start position:0%
did you choose this option because it
 
01:12:36.390 --> 01:12:36.400 align:start position:0%
was available or
 
01:12:39.110 --> 01:12:39.120 align:start position:0%
did you kind of find this opportunity to
 
01:12:43.110 --> 01:12:43.120 align:start position:0%
move into a triplex uh and rent
 
01:12:44.390 --> 01:12:44.400 align:start position:0%
uh i
 
01:12:46.470 --> 01:12:46.480 align:start position:0%
looked at several places some were
 
01:12:48.870 --> 01:12:48.880 align:start position:0%
further out of town some were more local
 
01:12:50.390 --> 01:12:50.400 align:start position:0%
i chose it because
 
01:12:52.149 --> 01:12:52.159 align:start position:0%
it's a great location
 
01:12:54.310 --> 01:12:54.320 align:start position:0%
it's the kind of place i want to live
 
01:12:57.110 --> 01:12:57.120 align:start position:0%
that's dense that's walkable that has
 
01:12:59.910 --> 01:12:59.920 align:start position:0%
places to go within walking distance not
 
01:13:02.790 --> 01:13:02.800 align:start position:0%
just the houses are close together but
 
01:13:04.470 --> 01:13:04.480 align:start position:0%
there's you know coffee shops there's
 
01:13:07.030 --> 01:13:07.040 align:start position:0%
downtown everything's right there so i
 
01:13:10.070 --> 01:13:10.080 align:start position:0%
chose specifically to live in a place
 
01:13:11.830 --> 01:13:11.840 align:start position:0%
and i couldn't afford to rent a whole
 
01:13:13.910 --> 01:13:13.920 align:start position:0%
house nor would i want to i'm one person
 
01:13:17.350 --> 01:13:17.360 align:start position:0%
with a dog like i don't need a big space
 
01:13:19.270 --> 01:13:19.280 align:start position:0%
so this is the kind of place i want to
 
01:13:25.430 --> 01:13:25.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:27.910 --> 01:13:27.920 align:start position:0%
one quick follow-up is portsmouth the
 
01:13:31.110 --> 01:13:31.120 align:start position:0%
livable walkable community or it's just
 
01:13:33.750 --> 01:13:33.760 align:start position:0%
a compact
 
01:13:36.229 --> 01:13:36.239 align:start position:0%
community that welcomes people like you
 
01:13:36.239 --> 01:13:37.110 align:start position:0%
community that welcomes people like you
um

01:13:37.110 --> 01:13:37.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:13:37.120 --> 01:13:38.550 align:start position:0%
um
yes

01:13:38.550 --> 01:13:38.560 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:13:41.510 --> 01:13:41.520 align:start position:0%
it is a it is a livable walkable place
 
01:13:43.990 --> 01:13:44.000 align:start position:0%
it's expensive which is one of the
 
01:13:46.790 --> 01:13:46.800 align:start position:0%
reasons that this kind of bill would
 
01:13:48.229 --> 01:13:48.239 align:start position:0%
improve things
 
01:13:51.590 --> 01:13:51.600 align:start position:0%
is that it's relatively difficult to
 
01:13:54.630 --> 01:13:54.640 align:start position:0%
make more of the portsmouth that we love
 
01:13:56.790 --> 01:13:56.800 align:start position:0%
um so
 
01:13:58.149 --> 01:13:58.159 align:start position:0%
the places
 
01:14:00.470 --> 01:14:00.480 align:start position:0%
you have to get lucky to find a good
 
01:14:03.270 --> 01:14:03.280 align:start position:0%
apartment there just because it is in so
 
01:14:06.070 --> 01:14:06.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:07.910 --> 01:14:07.920 align:start position:0%
representative cleve
 
01:14:09.830 --> 01:14:09.840 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chair and
 
01:14:11.830 --> 01:14:11.840 align:start position:0%
my apologies because i had hoped not to
 
01:14:13.910 --> 01:14:13.920 align:start position:0%
ask a parking question and i'm going to
 
01:14:18.229 --> 01:14:18.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:20.550 --> 01:14:20.560 align:start position:0%
my question is
 
01:14:23.110 --> 01:14:23.120 align:start position:0%
and before i ask it just to let you know
 
01:14:25.110 --> 01:14:25.120 align:start position:0%
the community i live in
 
01:14:27.189 --> 01:14:27.199 align:start position:0%
we don't allow overnight parking from
 
01:14:30.070 --> 01:14:30.080 align:start position:0%
midnight until 6 pm without permit and
 
01:14:32.149 --> 01:14:32.159 align:start position:0%
only in certain locations so my question
 
01:14:34.070 --> 01:14:34.080 align:start position:0%
is the community you live in do they
 
01:14:37.270 --> 01:14:37.280 align:start position:0%
allow overnight on street parking
 
01:14:40.310 --> 01:14:40.320 align:start position:0%
um without any kind of other than snow
 
01:14:42.310 --> 01:14:42.320 align:start position:0%
and i know that the foul weather type of
 
01:14:43.990 --> 01:14:44.000 align:start position:0%
thing yeah absolutely i don't know why
 
01:14:46.709 --> 01:14:46.719 align:start position:0%
you wouldn't i mean it's there's four i
 
01:14:48.790 --> 01:14:48.800 align:start position:0%
think it's a we have 60 foot of frontage
 
01:14:51.030 --> 01:14:51.040 align:start position:0%
or something like that which is for
 
01:14:52.470 --> 01:14:52.480 align:start position:0%
parking spaces
 
01:14:52.480 --> 01:14:53.430 align:start position:0%
parking spaces
and

01:14:53.430 --> 01:14:53.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:14:55.910 --> 01:14:55.920 align:start position:0%
i don't why would you take that curb
 
01:14:58.390 --> 01:14:58.400 align:start position:0%
space away from the people who live in
 
01:15:01.590 --> 01:15:01.600 align:start position:0%
that community i it baffles my mind and
 
01:15:03.189 --> 01:15:03.199 align:start position:0%

speakers have done an excellent job i
 
01:16:26.470 --> 01:16:26.480 align:start position:0%
can't add much more to it but i do want
 
01:16:28.790 --> 01:16:28.800 align:start position:0%
to add a little bit of emphasis
 
01:16:30.709 --> 01:16:30.719 align:start position:0%
on the need to attract and retain more
 
01:16:33.590 --> 01:16:33.600 align:start position:0%
young people and its relation to housing
 
01:16:36.070 --> 01:16:36.080 align:start position:0%
both options and affordability you know
 
01:16:37.510 --> 01:16:37.520 align:start position:0%
new hampshire as you may know is the
 
01:16:39.910 --> 01:16:39.920 align:start position:0%
second oldest state in the country and
 
01:16:41.590 --> 01:16:41.600 align:start position:0%
we have one of the lowest unemployment
 
01:16:43.030 --> 01:16:43.040 align:start position:0%
rates pre-coveted now we're back at
 
01:16:45.350 --> 01:16:45.360 align:start position:0%
pre-coped levels now at what 2.6 i
 
01:16:48.390 --> 01:16:48.400 align:start position:0%
believe the data came out last week
 
01:16:50.790 --> 01:16:50.800 align:start position:0%
so we need more people in general we
 
01:16:52.950 --> 01:16:52.960 align:start position:0%
need more young people in particular not
 
01:16:55.430 --> 01:16:55.440 align:start position:0%
just for our employers who are screaming
 
01:16:57.510 --> 01:16:57.520 align:start position:0%
for employees across industries across
 
01:16:59.669 --> 01:16:59.679 align:start position:0%
the state you know but our towns you
 
01:17:01.030 --> 01:17:01.040 align:start position:0%
know who need volunteers to serve in
 
01:17:02.550 --> 01:17:02.560 align:start position:0%
those planning board positions those
 
01:17:04.310 --> 01:17:04.320 align:start position:0%
conservation commissions you know for
 
01:17:05.750 --> 01:17:05.760 align:start position:0%
our non-profits who need people to serve
 
01:17:07.270 --> 01:17:07.280 align:start position:0%
on their boards of directors and their
 
01:17:09.510 --> 01:17:09.520 align:start position:0%
committees to do the work that we need
 
01:17:11.110 --> 01:17:11.120 align:start position:0%
done in civil society here in new
 
01:17:13.110 --> 01:17:13.120 align:start position:0%
hampshire you know and again for our
 
01:17:13.120 --> 01:17:14.550 align:start position:0%
hampshire you know and again for our
employers

01:17:14.550 --> 01:17:14.560 align:start position:0%
employers
 
01:17:16.709 --> 01:17:16.719 align:start position:0%
the biggest barrier facing young people
 
01:17:18.390 --> 01:17:18.400 align:start position:0%
and we know this at state work play
 
01:17:20.070 --> 01:17:20.080 align:start position:0%
through both data and a number of
 
01:17:21.750 --> 01:17:21.760 align:start position:0%
anecdotal conversations that we've had
 
01:17:23.189 --> 01:17:23.199 align:start position:0%
in um
 
01:17:25.030 --> 01:17:25.040 align:start position:0%
across the state you know in recent
 
01:17:27.350 --> 01:17:27.360 align:start position:0%
years is housing it's it's housing
 
01:17:29.030 --> 01:17:29.040 align:start position:0%
affordability as representative
 
01:17:30.550 --> 01:17:30.560 align:start position:0%
gallagher noted with his brother having
 
01:17:32.870 --> 01:17:32.880 align:start position:0%
to move out to oregon it's incredibly
 
01:17:35.510 --> 01:17:35.520 align:start position:0%
difficult uh to find a
 
01:17:37.510 --> 01:17:37.520 align:start position:0%
starter home either an apartment or
 
01:17:39.430 --> 01:17:39.440 align:start position:0%
certainly a place to buy increasingly
 
01:17:41.350 --> 01:17:41.360 align:start position:0%
increasingly difficult you know so for
 
01:17:42.870 --> 01:17:42.880 align:start position:0%
that reason you know we need more
 
01:17:44.790 --> 01:17:44.800 align:start position:0%
housing options we need to increase that
 
01:17:46.709 --> 01:17:46.719 align:start position:0%
uh supply because this is a supply and
 
01:17:48.470 --> 01:17:48.480 align:start position:0%
demand issue and it's being artificially
 
01:17:50.790 --> 01:17:50.800 align:start position:0%
constrained right now you know let's let
 
01:17:52.870 --> 01:17:52.880 align:start position:0%
uh your property owners you know have
 
01:17:54.630 --> 01:17:54.640 align:start position:0%
more rights with their own property you
 
01:17:56.470 --> 01:17:56.480 align:start position:0%
know to let the market
 
01:17:59.270 --> 01:17:59.280 align:start position:0%
help alleviate this situation thank you
 
01:18:01.590 --> 01:18:01.600 align:start position:0%
any questions from mr stewart
 
01:18:03.110 --> 01:18:03.120 align:start position:0%
from the committee
 
01:18:06.070 --> 01:18:06.080 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
01:18:08.790 --> 01:18:08.800 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um
 
01:18:10.470 --> 01:18:10.480 align:start position:0%
thank you mr
 
01:18:12.870 --> 01:18:12.880 align:start position:0%
stewart for taking my question
 
01:18:15.830 --> 01:18:15.840 align:start position:0%
so you have been with the work play and
 
01:18:18.550 --> 01:18:18.560 align:start position:0%
stay in new hampshire for a few years
 
01:18:20.950 --> 01:18:20.960 align:start position:0%
yes ma'am and uh this was pre-covered
 
01:18:24.630 --> 01:18:24.640 align:start position:0%
too correct absolutely okay so um you
 
01:18:28.310 --> 01:18:28.320 align:start position:0%
hit the very key point on unemployment
 
01:18:31.350 --> 01:18:31.360 align:start position:0%
how would not just the unemployment
 
01:18:32.870 --> 01:18:32.880 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:18:36.630 --> 01:18:36.640 align:start position:0%
attracting more younger diverse
 
01:18:39.510 --> 01:18:39.520 align:start position:0%
how would this also
 
01:18:42.390 --> 01:18:42.400 align:start position:0%
in terms of attracting
 
01:18:42.400 --> 01:18:44.550 align:start position:0%
in terms of attracting
diversity

01:18:44.550 --> 01:18:44.560 align:start position:0%
diversity
 
01:18:47.590 --> 01:18:47.600 align:start position:0%
of folks coming into the state
 
01:18:49.510 --> 01:18:49.520 align:start position:0%
you know i think having more options you
 
01:18:51.830 --> 01:18:51.840 align:start position:0%
know makes it a possibility for more
 
01:18:54.149 --> 01:18:54.159 align:start position:0%
people of all backgrounds you know to be
 
01:18:56.390 --> 01:18:56.400 align:start position:0%
able to move here and uh you know part
 
01:18:57.830 --> 01:18:57.840 align:start position:0%
of the challenge right now you mentioned
 
01:18:59.669 --> 01:18:59.679 align:start position:0%
you know employment and employers and
 
01:19:01.590 --> 01:19:01.600 align:start position:0%
increasingly your housing is becoming an
 
01:19:03.990 --> 01:19:04.000 align:start position:0%
employer concern you know it's something
 
01:19:05.430 --> 01:19:05.440 align:start position:0%
that you know i've heard from employers
 
01:19:07.270 --> 01:19:07.280 align:start position:0%
you know on the seacoast who in
 
01:19:09.270 --> 01:19:09.280 align:start position:0%
portsmouth in particular you know in the
 
01:19:10.950 --> 01:19:10.960 align:start position:0%
restaurant and other entertainment
 
01:19:12.470 --> 01:19:12.480 align:start position:0%
industries also in the lakes region and
 
01:19:14.470 --> 01:19:14.480 align:start position:0%
beyond you know who say that you know
 
01:19:16.310 --> 01:19:16.320 align:start position:0%
they would you know they're screaming
 
01:19:18.229 --> 01:19:18.239 align:start position:0%
for employees you know they can only pay
 
01:19:21.110 --> 01:19:21.120 align:start position:0%
so much and that uh your their employers
 
01:19:23.110 --> 01:19:23.120 align:start position:0%
your employees can't afford to live
 
01:19:25.270 --> 01:19:25.280 align:start position:0%
anywhere near their place of business so
 
01:19:26.709 --> 01:19:26.719 align:start position:0%
they're having to go farther and farther
 
01:19:28.870 --> 01:19:28.880 align:start position:0%
out and um you know that's becoming
 
01:19:30.470 --> 01:19:30.480 align:start position:0%
unsustainable for those employees you
 
01:19:31.910 --> 01:19:31.920 align:start position:0%
know to be able to drive in and
 
01:19:33.669 --> 01:19:33.679 align:start position:0%
especially when they can get you know
 
01:19:35.270 --> 01:19:35.280 align:start position:0%
better wages closer to where they are
 
01:19:37.110 --> 01:19:37.120 align:start position:0%
they're more likely to stay there so
 
01:19:41.669 --> 01:19:41.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:42.790 --> 01:19:42.800 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:19:45.189 --> 01:19:45.199 align:start position:0%
um just flipping that coin a little bit
 
01:19:47.110 --> 01:19:47.120 align:start position:0%
work play stay
 
01:19:49.110 --> 01:19:49.120 align:start position:0%
play and stay in new hampshire but you
 
01:19:52.390 --> 01:19:52.400 align:start position:0%
could be working virtually elsewhere
 
01:19:54.870 --> 01:19:54.880 align:start position:0%
would new hampshire become an attractive
 
01:19:57.669 --> 01:19:57.679 align:start position:0%
destination for young folks to
 
01:20:01.590 --> 01:20:01.600 align:start position:0%
live here play here but work remotely
 
01:20:04.229 --> 01:20:04.239 align:start position:0%
god knows where but that would be that
 
01:20:05.830 --> 01:20:05.840 align:start position:0%
would be another
 
01:20:08.390 --> 01:20:08.400 align:start position:0%
source of economy
 
01:20:11.430 --> 01:20:11.440 align:start position:0%
for entertainment and uh revenue for new
 
01:20:13.350 --> 01:20:13.360 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire wouldn't that be
 
01:20:14.790 --> 01:20:14.800 align:start position:0%
correct yeah that's already the case
 
01:20:16.390 --> 01:20:16.400 align:start position:0%
we're seeing it as a previous speaker
 
01:20:18.470 --> 01:20:18.480 align:start position:0%
you know noted we are in the uh you know
 
01:20:19.990 --> 01:20:20.000 align:start position:0%
one of the top 10 destinations during
 
01:20:21.750 --> 01:20:21.760 align:start position:0%
covet and even pre-covered you know we
 
01:20:23.110 --> 01:20:23.120 align:start position:0%
were new hampshire is one of only 10
 
01:20:25.270 --> 01:20:25.280 align:start position:0%
states you know that's seeing an influx
 
01:20:27.030 --> 01:20:27.040 align:start position:0%
of people in their 20s and 30s you know
 
01:20:29.430 --> 01:20:29.440 align:start position:0%
a net in migration it's modest yo but
 
01:20:31.430 --> 01:20:31.440 align:start position:0%
it's here and i think you know now that
 
01:20:32.629 --> 01:20:32.639 align:start position:0%
uh you know these work from home
 
01:20:34.070 --> 01:20:34.080 align:start position:0%
opportunities are certainly more
 
01:20:36.390 --> 01:20:36.400 align:start position:0%
prevalent than before it's you know all
 
01:20:38.550 --> 01:20:38.560 align:start position:0%
that much more likely and uh you know
 
01:20:40.709 --> 01:20:40.719 align:start position:0%
i'll say with one thing it's
 
01:20:42.390 --> 01:20:42.400 align:start position:0%
new hampshire is a super attractive
 
01:20:44.149 --> 01:20:44.159 align:start position:0%
place for so many reasons you you
 
01:20:45.350 --> 01:20:45.360 align:start position:0%
mentioned the playing and all the
 
01:20:46.950 --> 01:20:46.960 align:start position:0%
outdoor recreational amenities that we
 
01:20:48.709 --> 01:20:48.719 align:start position:0%
have here and those opportunities which
 
01:20:50.470 --> 01:20:50.480 align:start position:0%
is a big reason that people want to be
 
01:20:52.550 --> 01:20:52.560 align:start position:0%
here they want young people want to be
 
01:20:52.560 --> 01:20:53.430 align:start position:0%
here they want young people want to be
here

01:20:53.430 --> 01:20:53.440 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:20:55.750 --> 01:20:55.760 align:start position:0%
but they they find it very challenging
 
01:20:58.229 --> 01:20:58.239 align:start position:0%
to do so and especially to to come in
 
01:21:00.870 --> 01:21:00.880 align:start position:0%
with no uh you know family support or
 
01:21:02.310 --> 01:21:02.320 align:start position:0%
anything like that i remember i
 
01:21:03.669 --> 01:21:03.679 align:start position:0%
mentioned you know statewide going
 
01:21:05.110 --> 01:21:05.120 align:start position:0%
around the state in recent years i
 
01:21:05.120 --> 01:21:05.990 align:start position:0%
around the state in recent years i
remember

01:21:05.990 --> 01:21:06.000 align:start position:0%
remember
 
01:21:08.310 --> 01:21:08.320 align:start position:0%
we were up in lebanon and uh at the salt
 
01:21:10.390 --> 01:21:10.400 align:start position:0%
hill pub you know talking to a group of
 
01:21:11.590 --> 01:21:11.600 align:start position:0%
young people about what they like about
 
01:21:13.189 --> 01:21:13.199 align:start position:0%
the upper valley and what might cause
 
01:21:15.669 --> 01:21:15.679 align:start position:0%
them to leave and
 
01:21:17.030 --> 01:21:17.040 align:start position:0%
one of the things this a young woman
 
01:21:18.550 --> 01:21:18.560 align:start position:0%
said and she was speaking specifically
 
01:21:19.669 --> 01:21:19.679 align:start position:0%
to the upper ballet but i think it
 
01:21:21.270 --> 01:21:21.280 align:start position:0%
applies you kind of writ large to new
 
01:21:24.709 --> 01:21:24.719 align:start position:0%
hampshire she said the upper valley is a
 
01:21:27.189 --> 01:21:27.199 align:start position:0%
wonderful place to raise a family but it
 
01:21:29.270 --> 01:21:29.280 align:start position:0%
can be a very difficult place to start
 
01:21:31.590 --> 01:21:31.600 align:start position:0%
one and i think that's that's where we
 
01:21:33.510 --> 01:21:33.520 align:start position:0%
are right now and you know where
 
01:21:35.189 --> 01:21:35.199 align:start position:0%
solutions like this you know it's not a
 
01:21:36.550 --> 01:21:36.560 align:start position:0%
silver bullet it's not going to solve
 
01:21:38.390 --> 01:21:38.400 align:start position:0%
all the problems facing young people in
 
01:21:39.669 --> 01:21:39.679 align:start position:0%
new hampshire not even all the housing
 
01:21:40.790 --> 01:21:40.800 align:start position:0%
problems facing young people in new
 
01:21:43.669 --> 01:21:43.679 align:start position:0%
hampshire but it is you know one piece
 
01:21:46.470 --> 01:21:46.480 align:start position:0%
of the solution that i think could help
 
01:21:46.480 --> 01:21:49.990 align:start position:0%
of the solution that i think could help
yes

01:21:49.990 --> 01:21:50.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:51.750 --> 01:21:51.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you mr
 
01:21:53.830 --> 01:21:53.840 align:start position:0%
stewart for your testimony
 
01:21:55.510 --> 01:21:55.520 align:start position:0%
you mentioned that
 
01:21:57.510 --> 01:21:57.520 align:start position:0%
businesses have developed a concern
 
01:22:00.229 --> 01:22:00.239 align:start position:0%
about the limited housing for their
 
01:22:00.239 --> 01:22:01.510 align:start position:0%
about the limited housing for their
employees

01:22:01.510 --> 01:22:01.520 align:start position:0%
employees
 
01:22:04.229 --> 01:22:04.239 align:start position:0%
and and that and that's a concern
 
01:22:05.910 --> 01:22:05.920 align:start position:0%
are you aware of any businesses who have
 
01:22:07.910 --> 01:22:07.920 align:start position:0%
made a decision to leave the state or
 
01:22:10.070 --> 01:22:10.080 align:start position:0%
not come to the state because of the
 
01:22:12.070 --> 01:22:12.080 align:start position:0%
housing crunch
 
01:22:14.229 --> 01:22:14.239 align:start position:0%
you know it's hard to say that uh
 
01:22:15.590 --> 01:22:15.600 align:start position:0%
businesses i don't have enough knowledge
 
01:22:17.270 --> 01:22:17.280 align:start position:0%
to say businesses outside the state not
 
01:22:19.590 --> 01:22:19.600 align:start position:0%
coming here you know but i can certainly
 
01:22:21.990 --> 01:22:22.000 align:start position:0%
you know speak to you know some here
 
01:22:24.149 --> 01:22:24.159 align:start position:0%
that are evaluating all of their options
 
01:22:26.310 --> 01:22:26.320 align:start position:0%
you know from you know the the labor
 
01:22:28.149 --> 01:22:28.159 align:start position:0%
supply being the biggest issue and
 
01:22:30.310 --> 01:22:30.320 align:start position:0%
housing being i think one of the biggest
 
01:22:31.990 --> 01:22:32.000 align:start position:0%
you know bigger if not the biggest
 
01:22:34.149 --> 01:22:34.159 align:start position:0%
factor you know on the supply of labor
 
01:22:35.990 --> 01:22:36.000 align:start position:0%
you know here in the state who are
 
01:22:38.470 --> 01:22:38.480 align:start position:0%
looking at uh other places you know down
 
01:22:40.550 --> 01:22:40.560 align:start position:0%
south out west that have you know lower
 
01:22:42.390 --> 01:22:42.400 align:start position:0%
housing prices you know lower cost of
 
01:22:43.910 --> 01:22:43.920 align:start position:0%
living and
 
01:22:45.510 --> 01:22:45.520 align:start position:0%
you know that
 
01:22:47.110 --> 01:22:47.120 align:start position:0%
they might not otherwise consider if
 
01:22:50.390 --> 01:22:50.400 align:start position:0%
they didn't have to thank you
 
01:22:55.110 --> 01:22:55.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:57.350 --> 01:22:57.360 align:start position:0%
thank you mr stewart i appreciate your
 
01:23:00.310 --> 01:23:00.320 align:start position:0%
testimony and our penultimate speaker
 
01:23:01.590 --> 01:23:01.600 align:start position:0%
will be
 
01:23:08.709 --> 01:23:08.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:10.709 --> 01:23:10.719 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair h grace for the new
 
01:23:13.110 --> 01:23:13.120 align:start position:0%
hampshire municipal association
 
01:23:13.120 --> 01:23:13.990 align:start position:0%
hampshire municipal association
uh

01:23:13.990 --> 01:23:14.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:23:15.669 --> 01:23:15.679 align:start position:0%
we have the distinction of opposing this
 
01:23:19.030 --> 01:23:19.040 align:start position:0%
bill um it is a statewide zoning mandate
 
01:23:20.790 --> 01:23:20.800 align:start position:0%
and we we oppose statewide zoning
 
01:23:23.110 --> 01:23:23.120 align:start position:0%
mandates we support local control
 
01:23:26.550 --> 01:23:26.560 align:start position:0%
options uh historically zoning ordinance
 
01:23:28.550 --> 01:23:28.560 align:start position:0%
zoning ordinances have been determined
 
01:23:30.629 --> 01:23:30.639 align:start position:0%
at the local level and tailored to the
 
01:23:32.790 --> 01:23:32.800 align:start position:0%
specific community and we think that's
 
01:23:33.910 --> 01:23:33.920 align:start position:0%
the appropriate way that they should
 
01:23:35.590 --> 01:23:35.600 align:start position:0%
continue to be
 
01:23:38.229 --> 01:23:38.239 align:start position:0%
um continue to be
 
01:23:38.239 --> 01:23:39.510 align:start position:0%
um continue to be
created

01:23:39.510 --> 01:23:39.520 align:start position:0%
created
 
01:23:42.950 --> 01:23:42.960 align:start position:0%
um as far as this bill goes um there is
 
01:23:44.950 --> 01:23:44.960 align:start position:0%
one thing that came to my attention this
 
01:23:44.960 --> 01:23:46.229 align:start position:0%
one thing that came to my attention this
morning

01:23:46.229 --> 01:23:46.239 align:start position:0%
morning
 
01:23:47.990 --> 01:23:48.000 align:start position:0%
as the committee was was questioning
 
01:23:50.709 --> 01:23:50.719 align:start position:0%
some of the speakers um and that is
 
01:23:52.390 --> 01:23:52.400 align:start position:0%
i would caution the
 
01:23:54.149 --> 01:23:54.159 align:start position:0%
committee to look at the accessory
 
01:23:56.070 --> 01:23:56.080 align:start position:0%
dwelling unit statute
 
01:23:59.189 --> 01:23:59.199 align:start position:0%
rsa 674 colon 72.
 
01:24:01.270 --> 01:24:01.280 align:start position:0%
um in that there is a line that says the
 
01:24:03.030 --> 01:24:03.040 align:start position:0%
municipality is not required to allow
 
01:24:05.510 --> 01:24:05.520 align:start position:0%
more than one adu for any single family
 
01:24:05.520 --> 01:24:06.629 align:start position:0%
more than one adu for any single family
dwelling

01:24:06.629 --> 01:24:06.639 align:start position:0%
dwelling
 
01:24:08.950 --> 01:24:08.960 align:start position:0%
and that the municipality may prohibit
 
01:24:11.830 --> 01:24:11.840 align:start position:0%
an adu with multiple single-family
 
01:24:11.840 --> 01:24:13.189 align:start position:0%
an adu with multiple single-family
dwellings

01:24:13.189 --> 01:24:13.199 align:start position:0%
dwellings
 
01:24:13.199 --> 01:24:14.550 align:start position:0%
dwellings
that

01:24:14.550 --> 01:24:14.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:24:16.950 --> 01:24:16.960 align:start position:0%
appears to contradict
 
01:24:18.229 --> 01:24:18.239 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
01:24:20.310 --> 01:24:20.320 align:start position:0%
in the line about how the
 
01:24:20.320 --> 01:24:21.270 align:start position:0%
in the line about how the
lines

01:24:21.270 --> 01:24:21.280 align:start position:0%
lines
 
01:24:23.030 --> 01:24:23.040 align:start position:0%
six through eight
 
01:24:24.950 --> 01:24:24.960 align:start position:0%
and how the
 
01:24:26.470 --> 01:24:26.480 align:start position:0%
four unit
 
01:24:26.480 --> 01:24:28.390 align:start position:0%
four unit
building

01:24:28.390 --> 01:24:28.400 align:start position:0%
building
 
01:24:28.400 --> 01:24:29.430 align:start position:0%
building
or

01:24:29.430 --> 01:24:29.440 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:24:30.470 --> 01:24:30.480 align:start position:0%
other division
 
01:24:32.149 --> 01:24:32.159 align:start position:0%
um could be
 
01:24:35.030 --> 01:24:35.040 align:start position:0%
arranged particularly with regard to the
 
01:24:36.629 --> 01:24:36.639 align:start position:0%
one single family house with three
 
01:24:39.510 --> 01:24:39.520 align:start position:0%
accessory dwelling units um so there's
 
01:24:41.910 --> 01:24:41.920 align:start position:0%
some contradiction there that
 
01:24:43.830 --> 01:24:43.840 align:start position:0%
may have to be resolved if this is
 
01:24:46.229 --> 01:24:46.239 align:start position:0%
something that the committee wants to
 
01:24:47.910 --> 01:24:47.920 align:start position:0%
go forward with
 
01:24:49.750 --> 01:24:49.760 align:start position:0%
and of course there's also the the
 
01:24:49.760 --> 01:24:50.629 align:start position:0%
and of course there's also the the
second

01:24:50.629 --> 01:24:50.639 align:start position:0%
second
 
01:24:52.870 --> 01:24:52.880 align:start position:0%
part of the adu uh
 
01:24:56.629 --> 01:24:56.639 align:start position:0%
set of statutes 674 colon 73
 
01:24:59.189 --> 01:24:59.199 align:start position:0%
about detached adus
 
01:25:02.550 --> 01:25:02.560 align:start position:0%
and that may of course impact how
 
01:25:04.870 --> 01:25:04.880 align:start position:0%
such units may be configured as well
 
01:25:07.110 --> 01:25:07.120 align:start position:0%
i i lastly want to mention that the
 
01:25:09.110 --> 01:25:09.120 align:start position:0%
amendment um that was presented this
 
01:25:11.189 --> 01:25:11.199 align:start position:0%
morning by representative vann
 
01:25:13.350 --> 01:25:13.360 align:start position:0%
does address some of the concerns that
 
01:25:16.149 --> 01:25:16.159 align:start position:0%
some of our members have raised with
 
01:25:17.910 --> 01:25:17.920 align:start position:0%
regard to parking requirements i know
 
01:25:19.350 --> 01:25:19.360 align:start position:0%
that was an issue that was brought up by
 
01:25:21.669 --> 01:25:21.679 align:start position:0%
representative clee earlier
 
01:25:24.229 --> 01:25:24.239 align:start position:0%
it it was an issue i i asked
 
01:25:27.510 --> 01:25:27.520 align:start position:0%
representative van about last week
 
01:25:30.310 --> 01:25:30.320 align:start position:0%
and it does clarify that
 
01:25:30.320 --> 01:25:32.229 align:start position:0%
and it does clarify that
the

01:25:32.229 --> 01:25:32.239 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:25:35.110 --> 01:25:35.120 align:start position:0%
the number of parking units
 
01:25:37.110 --> 01:25:37.120 align:start position:0%
corresponds to the number of dwelling
 
01:25:37.120 --> 01:25:38.229 align:start position:0%
corresponds to the number of dwelling
units

01:25:38.229 --> 01:25:38.239 align:start position:0%
units
 
01:25:40.070 --> 01:25:40.080 align:start position:0%
and it was ambiguous in the bill is
 
01:25:41.750 --> 01:25:41.760 align:start position:0%
written as to how exactly that would
 
01:25:41.760 --> 01:25:42.790 align:start position:0%
written as to how exactly that would
function

01:25:42.790 --> 01:25:42.800 align:start position:0%
function
 
01:25:45.189 --> 01:25:45.199 align:start position:0%
um so i thank her for clarifying that
 
01:25:47.990 --> 01:25:48.000 align:start position:0%
i'm happy to answer any questions
 
01:25:51.110 --> 01:25:51.120 align:start position:0%
any questions yes representative
 
01:25:52.709 --> 01:25:52.719 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you mr
 
01:25:54.470 --> 01:25:54.480 align:start position:0%
grace for taking my question
 
01:25:57.030 --> 01:25:57.040 align:start position:0%
uh your first comment in your testimony
 
01:25:59.510 --> 01:25:59.520 align:start position:0%
was about the fact that this isn't
 
01:26:01.510 --> 01:26:01.520 align:start position:0%
enabling legislation that it would be a
 
01:26:01.520 --> 01:26:02.709 align:start position:0%
enabling legislation that it would be a
mandate

01:26:02.709 --> 01:26:02.719 align:start position:0%
mandate
 
01:26:05.189 --> 01:26:05.199 align:start position:0%
so and i know representative vann
 
01:26:09.830 --> 01:26:09.840 align:start position:0%
referred to that as preemptive zoning
 
01:26:11.270 --> 01:26:11.280 align:start position:0%
is the new hampshire municipal
 
01:26:14.310 --> 01:26:14.320 align:start position:0%
association against all preemptive
 
01:26:15.990 --> 01:26:16.000 align:start position:0%
legislation or do you find that there
 
01:26:18.229 --> 01:26:18.239 align:start position:0%
may be situations where the state does
 
01:26:19.910 --> 01:26:19.920 align:start position:0%
need to
 
01:26:23.030 --> 01:26:23.040 align:start position:0%
mandate municipalities to
 
01:26:25.590 --> 01:26:25.600 align:start position:0%
abide by the same rig the same
 
01:26:25.600 --> 01:26:26.950 align:start position:0%
abide by the same rig the same
regulation

01:26:26.950 --> 01:26:26.960 align:start position:0%
regulation
 
01:26:28.790 --> 01:26:28.800 align:start position:0%
so our policies are adopted by our
 
01:26:31.189 --> 01:26:31.199 align:start position:0%
members at our bi-annual conference and
 
01:26:33.510 --> 01:26:33.520 align:start position:0%
one of the policies they've adopted is
 
01:26:35.669 --> 01:26:35.679 align:start position:0%
to oppose statewide zoning mandates so
 
01:26:38.790 --> 01:26:38.800 align:start position:0%
where that's the case we oppose those
 
01:26:40.709 --> 01:26:40.719 align:start position:0%
there are
 
01:26:42.870 --> 01:26:42.880 align:start position:0%
i guess cases where
 
01:26:45.350 --> 01:26:45.360 align:start position:0%
things don't fall neatly into
 
01:26:47.750 --> 01:26:47.760 align:start position:0%
into buckets like this one does is
 
01:26:49.270 --> 01:26:49.280 align:start position:0%
clearly a zoning mandate in which case
 
01:26:50.870 --> 01:26:50.880 align:start position:0%
we would go back and ask our board for
 
01:26:52.149 --> 01:26:52.159 align:start position:0%
further guidance
 
01:26:53.430 --> 01:26:53.440 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
01:26:54.709 --> 01:26:54.719 align:start position:0%
any other further questions yes
 
01:26:54.719 --> 01:26:56.470 align:start position:0%
any other further questions yes
representative

representative
 
01:26:58.709 --> 01:26:58.719 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you mr grace
 
01:27:01.830 --> 01:27:01.840 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
01:27:05.270 --> 01:27:05.280 align:start position:0%
to further expand on representative
 
01:27:05.280 --> 01:27:06.470 align:start position:0%
to further expand on representative
rung's

01:27:06.470 --> 01:27:06.480 align:start position:0%
rung's
 
01:27:10.229 --> 01:27:10.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:12.149 --> 01:27:12.159 align:start position:0%
new hampshire municipal association
 
01:27:15.990 --> 01:27:16.000 align:start position:0%
opposes statewide
 
01:27:19.510 --> 01:27:19.520 align:start position:0%
zoning ordinance or changes and
 
01:27:21.830 --> 01:27:21.840 align:start position:0%
but what is the solution that new
 
01:27:24.470 --> 01:27:24.480 align:start position:0%
hampshire municipal association would
 
01:27:27.189 --> 01:27:27.199 align:start position:0%
offer or would be willing to work
 
01:27:31.270 --> 01:27:31.280 align:start position:0%
in order to address the acute crisis
 
01:27:34.229 --> 01:27:34.239 align:start position:0%
that we have for housing in our state
 
01:27:34.239 --> 01:27:35.030 align:start position:0%
that we have for housing in our state
and

01:27:35.030 --> 01:27:35.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:27:39.590 --> 01:27:39.600 align:start position:0%
acute shortage of workforce and all that
 
01:27:41.750 --> 01:27:41.760 align:start position:0%
you know is there a solution
 
01:27:44.790 --> 01:27:44.800 align:start position:0%
i i don't have a solution if i did i
 
01:27:45.910 --> 01:27:45.920 align:start position:0%
would certainly offer that to the
 
01:27:47.750 --> 01:27:47.760 align:start position:0%
committee i'm certainly happy to work
 
01:27:49.990 --> 01:27:50.000 align:start position:0%
with anyone on any bill they have
 
01:27:51.830 --> 01:27:51.840 align:start position:0%
related to municipal matters including
 
01:27:53.510 --> 01:27:53.520 align:start position:0%
zoning matters
 
01:27:55.830 --> 01:27:55.840 align:start position:0%
certainly i see my role as being
 
01:27:57.669 --> 01:27:57.679 align:start position:0%
informative as well as advocating for
 
01:28:03.030 --> 01:28:03.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:05.830 --> 01:28:05.840 align:start position:0%
thank you uh mr chairman and uh thank
 
01:28:07.430 --> 01:28:07.440 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question
 
01:28:07.440 --> 01:28:09.910 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question
um

01:28:09.910 --> 01:28:09.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:12.149 --> 01:28:12.159 align:start position:0%
i i guess i'm looking for clarification
 
01:28:12.159 --> 01:28:12.830 align:start position:0%
i i guess i'm looking for clarification
so

01:28:12.830 --> 01:28:12.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:28:16.790 --> 01:28:16.800 align:start position:0%
the the relative to opposing mandated
 
01:28:19.590 --> 01:28:19.600 align:start position:0%
zoning is because each community is
 
01:28:21.350 --> 01:28:21.360 align:start position:0%
different and unique
 
01:28:23.750 --> 01:28:23.760 align:start position:0%
and therefore they would have to know
 
01:28:24.950 --> 01:28:24.960 align:start position:0%
what was best for them and it would be
 
01:28:27.510 --> 01:28:27.520 align:start position:0%
more difficult to just do an umbrella
 
01:28:29.430 --> 01:28:29.440 align:start position:0%
type of law is that is that the stance
 
01:28:31.270 --> 01:28:31.280 align:start position:0%
that you guys have taken yes and if i
 
01:28:33.669 --> 01:28:33.679 align:start position:0%
could i use an example that you brought
 
01:28:35.430 --> 01:28:35.440 align:start position:0%
up earlier you know it appears there's a
 
01:28:37.910 --> 01:28:37.920 align:start position:0%
community in nashua where
 
01:28:39.910 --> 01:28:39.920 align:start position:0%
there isn't sufficient street parking
 
01:28:42.470 --> 01:28:42.480 align:start position:0%
for the number of uh dwelling units that
 
01:28:43.830 --> 01:28:43.840 align:start position:0%
might be created
 
01:28:45.910 --> 01:28:45.920 align:start position:0%
whereas portsmouth
 
01:28:47.750 --> 01:28:47.760 align:start position:0%
it appears from the testimony received
 
01:28:49.110 --> 01:28:49.120 align:start position:0%
by the committee earlier that that's not
 
01:28:50.709 --> 01:28:50.719 align:start position:0%
the issue so you know there are
 
01:28:52.550 --> 01:28:52.560 align:start position:0%
differences between communities i i
 
01:28:52.560 --> 01:28:53.750 align:start position:0%
differences between communities i i
obviously

01:28:53.750 --> 01:28:53.760 align:start position:0%
obviously
 
01:28:55.990 --> 01:28:56.000 align:start position:0%
can't resolve all of those but that's
 
01:28:57.750 --> 01:28:57.760 align:start position:0%
that's traditionally why zoning has been
 
01:29:00.629 --> 01:29:00.639 align:start position:0%
determined at a uh at a local level and
 
01:29:02.070 --> 01:29:02.080 align:start position:0%
why we think it is appropriate for it to
 
01:29:03.750 --> 01:29:03.760 align:start position:0%
continue to remain that way
 
01:29:06.310 --> 01:29:06.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:08.229 --> 01:29:08.239 align:start position:0%
yes representative power
 
01:29:09.669 --> 01:29:09.679 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
01:29:11.189 --> 01:29:11.199 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
01:29:15.830 --> 01:29:15.840 align:start position:0%
um in your testimony you referred to an
 
01:29:15.840 --> 01:29:17.189 align:start position:0%
um in your testimony you referred to an
rsa

01:29:17.189 --> 01:29:17.199 align:start position:0%
rsa
 
01:29:19.590 --> 01:29:19.600 align:start position:0%
pertaining to adus could you repeat that
 
01:29:23.590 --> 01:29:23.600 align:start position:0%
first reference yes that was our say 674
 
01:29:27.110 --> 01:29:27.120 align:start position:0%
colon 72 um that's the
 
01:29:30.950 --> 01:29:30.960 align:start position:0%
the first of two um adu statutes um and
 
01:29:33.030 --> 01:29:33.040 align:start position:0%
it essentially what it does is it states
 
01:29:33.040 --> 01:29:34.149 align:start position:0%
it essentially what it does is it states
that

01:29:34.149 --> 01:29:34.159 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:29:36.629 --> 01:29:36.639 align:start position:0%
uh everywhere there's a single family
 
01:29:36.639 --> 01:29:37.510 align:start position:0%
uh everywhere there's a single family
home

01:29:37.510 --> 01:29:37.520 align:start position:0%
home
 
01:29:39.669 --> 01:29:39.679 align:start position:0%
a municipality must allow
 
01:29:39.679 --> 01:29:41.590 align:start position:0%
a municipality must allow
a

01:29:41.590 --> 01:29:41.600 align:start position:0%

adu
 
01:29:45.990 --> 01:29:46.000 align:start position:0%
and then it goes on to state that a
 
01:29:47.910 --> 01:29:47.920 align:start position:0%
municipality may prohibit more than one
 
01:29:47.920 --> 01:29:49.430 align:start position:0%

01:29:49.440 --> 01:29:50.470 align:start position:0%
adu
per

per
 
01:29:53.430 --> 01:29:53.440 align:start position:0%
single-family dwelling and
 
01:29:55.350 --> 01:29:55.360 align:start position:0%
they also prohibit adus where there are
 
01:29:57.350 --> 01:29:57.360 align:start position:0%
multiple single-family dwellings on the
 
01:29:59.990 --> 01:30:00.000 align:start position:0%
same lot like a townhouse um there's
 
01:30:01.910 --> 01:30:01.920 align:start position:0%
actually a short
 
01:30:03.830 --> 01:30:03.840 align:start position:0%
list of things there but the one i
 
01:30:06.229 --> 01:30:06.239 align:start position:0%
remember is townhouse
 
01:30:09.110 --> 01:30:09.120 align:start position:0%
so that may um or doesn't
 
01:30:10.709 --> 01:30:10.719 align:start position:0%
have a have a
 
01:30:15.350 --> 01:30:15.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:18.870 --> 01:30:18.880 align:start position:0%
and our last speaker thank you
 
01:30:20.470 --> 01:30:20.480 align:start position:0%

01:30:57.510 --> 01:30:57.520 align:start position:0%
it is a privilege to come before you
 
01:30:59.590 --> 01:30:59.600 align:start position:0%
again and especially to be able to do so
 
01:31:01.510 --> 01:31:01.520 align:start position:0%
this year in person
 
01:31:04.870 --> 01:31:04.880 align:start position:0%
allowing more homes per lot as hb 1177
 
01:31:05.830 --> 01:31:05.840 align:start position:0%
would do
 
01:31:07.430 --> 01:31:07.440 align:start position:0%
would promote affordability conserve
 
01:31:09.590 --> 01:31:09.600 align:start position:0%
municipal resources have less impact on
 
01:31:12.310 --> 01:31:12.320 align:start position:0%
far forests and farmland and promote
 
01:31:14.390 --> 01:31:14.400 align:start position:0%
property rights while leaving intact the
 
01:31:16.390 --> 01:31:16.400 align:start position:0%
look and feel of neighborhoods
 
01:31:18.390 --> 01:31:18.400 align:start position:0%
in my written testimony i discussed some
 
01:31:20.229 --> 01:31:20.239 align:start position:0%
of the benefits of denser zoning and
 
01:31:22.149 --> 01:31:22.159 align:start position:0%
other cities and states experiences with
 
01:31:23.910 --> 01:31:23.920 align:start position:0%
similar policies
 
01:31:25.750 --> 01:31:25.760 align:start position:0%
but i want to focus my remarks on the
 
01:31:27.990 --> 01:31:28.000 align:start position:0%
real issue at stake here which is not
 
01:31:29.830 --> 01:31:29.840 align:start position:0%
the the modest but positive effects this
 
01:31:31.910 --> 01:31:31.920 align:start position:0%
bill is likely to have but whether the
 
01:31:34.310 --> 01:31:34.320 align:start position:0%
state ought to decrease the regulatory
 
01:31:37.510 --> 01:31:37.520 align:start position:0%
authority it has granted municipalities
 
01:31:39.669 --> 01:31:39.679 align:start position:0%
as a new england native i am keenly
 
01:31:41.350 --> 01:31:41.360 align:start position:0%
aware that our towns have been vital
 
01:31:43.750 --> 01:31:43.760 align:start position:0%
institutions for centuries
 
01:31:45.110 --> 01:31:45.120 align:start position:0%
but local powers have never been
 
01:31:47.350 --> 01:31:47.360 align:start position:0%
boundless and have long been contested
 
01:31:48.709 --> 01:31:48.719 align:start position:0%
and restrained
 
01:31:50.870 --> 01:31:50.880 align:start position:0%
there are three arguments in favor of
 
01:31:53.510 --> 01:31:53.520 align:start position:0%
preempting municipal zoning authority
 
01:31:55.830 --> 01:31:55.840 align:start position:0%
number one property rights
 
01:31:57.830 --> 01:31:57.840 align:start position:0%
those who propose to limit citizens
 
01:31:59.669 --> 01:31:59.679 align:start position:0%
right to the normal use and enjoyment of
 
01:32:01.669 --> 01:32:01.679 align:start position:0%
their property ought to face the burden
 
01:32:03.030 --> 01:32:03.040 align:start position:0%
of proof
 
01:32:05.350 --> 01:32:05.360 align:start position:0%
unless the legislature believes there's
 
01:32:07.110 --> 01:32:07.120 align:start position:0%
a compelling reason
 
01:32:09.030 --> 01:32:09.040 align:start position:0%
that four households should not reside
 
01:32:10.870 --> 01:32:10.880 align:start position:0%
on a lot where one household can
 
01:32:12.790 --> 01:32:12.800 align:start position:0%
reasonably reside it ought to limit
 
01:32:14.709 --> 01:32:14.719 align:start position:0%
municipal authority to impose that
 
01:32:16.870 --> 01:32:16.880 align:start position:0%
specific restriction
 
01:32:18.870 --> 01:32:18.880 align:start position:0%
number two is fairness the state
 
01:32:21.510 --> 01:32:21.520 align:start position:0%
legislature can balance narrow town
 
01:32:23.430 --> 01:32:23.440 align:start position:0%
interests against the interests of
 
01:32:25.110 --> 01:32:25.120 align:start position:0%
granite staters who live outside the
 
01:32:27.030 --> 01:32:27.040 align:start position:0%
towns in question and do not have
 
01:32:27.040 --> 01:32:28.950 align:start position:0%
towns in question and do not have
representation

01:32:28.950 --> 01:32:28.960 align:start position:0%
representation
 
01:32:30.229 --> 01:32:30.239 align:start position:0%
and three
 
01:32:33.030 --> 01:32:33.040 align:start position:0%
solving statewide problems states can
 
01:32:34.790 --> 01:32:34.800 align:start position:0%
preempt local government when necessary
 
01:32:37.189 --> 01:32:37.199 align:start position:0%
to achieve a statewide goal for example
 
01:32:39.030 --> 01:32:39.040 align:start position:0%
recent zoning preemptions have been
 
01:32:41.110 --> 01:32:41.120 align:start position:0%
justified as necessary to address
 
01:32:42.950 --> 01:32:42.960 align:start position:0%
climate change or to increase economic
 
01:32:42.960 --> 01:32:44.310 align:start position:0%
climate change or to increase economic
growth

01:32:44.310 --> 01:32:44.320 align:start position:0%
growth
 
01:32:46.709 --> 01:32:46.719 align:start position:0%
unlike in the case of property rights
 
01:32:48.390 --> 01:32:48.400 align:start position:0%
here the burden of proof ought to be on
 
01:32:50.070 --> 01:32:50.080 align:start position:0%
the state to show that preempting a
 
01:32:51.830 --> 01:32:51.840 align:start position:0%
traditional domain of local government
 
01:32:53.990 --> 01:32:54.000 align:start position:0%
is in fact necessary to address a
 
01:32:56.310 --> 01:32:56.320 align:start position:0%
statewide problem
 
01:32:58.470 --> 01:32:58.480 align:start position:0%
thus the debate is not about whether the
 
01:32:59.990 --> 01:33:00.000 align:start position:0%
state should ever restrict local
 
01:33:02.070 --> 01:33:02.080 align:start position:0%
authority it already does
 
01:33:03.590 --> 01:33:03.600 align:start position:0%
using the framework i just gave the
 
01:33:05.189 --> 01:33:05.199 align:start position:0%
question is whether in this particular
 
01:33:07.030 --> 01:33:07.040 align:start position:0%
instance one
 
01:33:08.950 --> 01:33:08.960 align:start position:0%
local regulators can make a compelling
 
01:33:10.950 --> 01:33:10.960 align:start position:0%
case that maintaining single-family
 
01:33:12.950 --> 01:33:12.960 align:start position:0%
zoning is sufficiently important to
 
01:33:14.950 --> 01:33:14.960 align:start position:0%
merit restricting the use and enjoyment
 
01:33:16.470 --> 01:33:16.480 align:start position:0%
of private property
 
01:33:19.110 --> 01:33:19.120 align:start position:0%
and whether that case is outweighed by
 
01:33:19.120 --> 01:33:20.070 align:start position:0%
and whether that case is outweighed by
two

01:33:20.070 --> 01:33:20.080 align:start position:0%
two
 
01:33:21.590 --> 01:33:21.600 align:start position:0%
other citizens interest in housing
 
01:33:24.709 --> 01:33:24.719 align:start position:0%
availability or three statewide concerns
 
01:33:26.149 --> 01:33:26.159 align:start position:0%
such as environmental protection housing
 
01:33:28.870 --> 01:33:28.880 align:start position:0%
affordability and economic growth
 
01:33:31.030 --> 01:33:31.040 align:start position:0%
thus the bill before you and others like
 
01:33:33.750 --> 01:33:33.760 align:start position:0%
it are substantive not procedural
 
01:33:35.910 --> 01:33:35.920 align:start position:0%
questions state legislatures should not
 
01:33:37.990 --> 01:33:38.000 align:start position:0%
always preempt local authority nor
 
01:33:39.750 --> 01:33:39.760 align:start position:0%
should they always defer
 
01:33:42.550 --> 01:33:42.560 align:start position:0%
still in my view single-family zoning is
 
01:33:44.229 --> 01:33:44.239 align:start position:0%
ripe for reconsideration
 
01:33:45.830 --> 01:33:45.840 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time i'm happy to
 
01:33:47.350 --> 01:33:47.360 align:start position:0%
answer any questions any of your
 
01:33:47.360 --> 01:33:50.390 align:start position:0%
answer any questions any of your
questions

01:33:50.390 --> 01:33:50.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:50.400 --> 01:33:52.149 align:start position:0%
 
representative

01:33:52.149 --> 01:33:52.159 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:33:54.229 --> 01:33:54.239 align:start position:0%
thank you mr ted thank you for taking my
 
01:33:58.149 --> 01:33:58.159 align:start position:0%
question um you brought out the
 
01:34:01.350 --> 01:34:01.360 align:start position:0%
rental property rights kind of thing
 
01:34:01.360 --> 01:34:02.149 align:start position:0%
rental property rights kind of thing
is

01:34:02.149 --> 01:34:02.159 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:34:03.189 --> 01:34:03.199 align:start position:0%
would this
 
01:34:05.910 --> 01:34:05.920 align:start position:0%
uh bill enable
 
01:34:08.709 --> 01:34:08.719 align:start position:0%
uh the renter's representation also in
 
01:34:11.270 --> 01:34:11.280 align:start position:0%
the community by participating more
 
01:34:14.470 --> 01:34:14.480 align:start position:0%
because they have the option to rent
 
01:34:17.110 --> 01:34:17.120 align:start position:0%
yes so uh frequently small small
 
01:34:18.470 --> 01:34:18.480 align:start position:0%
multi-family dwellings are owner
 
01:34:20.229 --> 01:34:20.239 align:start position:0%
occupied and then you know one or two
 
01:34:22.070 --> 01:34:22.080 align:start position:0%
other units are rented out so it
 
01:34:24.310 --> 01:34:24.320 align:start position:0%
certainly can allow renters to have a
 
01:34:25.750 --> 01:34:25.760 align:start position:0%
greater choice of neighborhoods as other
 
01:34:29.590 --> 01:34:29.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:29.600 --> 01:34:30.550 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:34:30.550 --> 01:34:30.560 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:34:31.910 --> 01:34:31.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
01:34:39.590 --> 01:34:39.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:42.070 --> 01:34:42.080 align:start position:0%
i just want to follow up on nate gray's
 
01:34:44.470 --> 01:34:44.480 align:start position:0%
comment about the edus i'll put in an
 
01:34:46.229 --> 01:34:46.239 align:start position:0%
amendment that takes that strikes the
 
01:34:48.870 --> 01:34:48.880 align:start position:0%
adu really the goal there was just to
 
01:34:51.910 --> 01:34:51.920 align:start position:0%
say it can be any kind it can be one
 
01:34:53.910 --> 01:34:53.920 align:start position:0%
building two buildings three buildings
 
01:34:55.030 --> 01:34:55.040 align:start position:0%
or four
 
01:34:57.510 --> 01:34:57.520 align:start position:0%
as long as it conforms to the local
 
01:35:00.310 --> 01:35:00.320 align:start position:0%
setbacks coverage parking etc so i'll
 
01:35:02.709 --> 01:35:02.719 align:start position:0%
just strike the language about adus and
 
01:35:04.229 --> 01:35:04.239 align:start position:0%
that'll fix it
 
01:35:05.990 --> 01:35:06.000 align:start position:0%
be ready before we uh what are you
 
01:35:07.750 --> 01:35:07.760 align:start position:0%
planning to execute
 
01:35:10.310 --> 01:35:10.320 align:start position:0%
uh probably next week yeah i'll go do it
 
01:35:11.910 --> 01:35:11.920 align:start position:0%
today and they'll do it for me right
 
01:35:15.189 --> 01:35:15.199 align:start position:0%
away thanks okay thank you uh
 
01:35:17.189 --> 01:35:17.199 align:start position:0%
at this point i'm going to
 
01:35:19.990 --> 01:35:20.000 align:start position:0%
allow the committee to take a quick
 
01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:20.870 align:start position:0%
allow the committee to take a quick
break

01:35:20.870 --> 01:35:20.880 align:start position:0%
break
 
01:35:26.310 --> 01:35:26.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:29.270 --> 01:35:29.280 align:start position:0%

also or can we still treat him like one
 
01:36:06.790 --> 01:36:06.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:53.830 --> 01:39:53.840 align:start position:0%

01:45:49.350 --> 01:45:49.360 align:start position:0%
to you today house bill 1194
 
01:45:51.910 --> 01:45:51.920 align:start position:0%
relative to the procedure for overriding
 
01:45:53.910 --> 01:45:53.920 align:start position:0%
a local tax cap
 
01:45:56.149 --> 01:45:56.159 align:start position:0%
for the record i am representative diane
 
01:45:59.189 --> 01:45:59.199 align:start position:0%
power i represent the towns of brookline
 
01:46:01.990 --> 01:46:02.000 align:start position:0%
in and mason in hillsborough county
 
01:46:04.149 --> 01:46:04.159 align:start position:0%
district 26.
 
01:46:06.390 --> 01:46:06.400 align:start position:0%
this bill requires a three-fifth
 
01:46:09.109 --> 01:46:09.119 align:start position:0%
super-majority vote of a legislative
 
01:46:12.950 --> 01:46:12.960 align:start position:0%
body to override a local tax cap
 
01:46:15.830 --> 01:46:15.840 align:start position:0%
this bill is a constituent request
 
01:46:18.070 --> 01:46:18.080 align:start position:0%
following the signing into law of a
 
01:46:22.229 --> 01:46:22.239 align:start position:0%
similar bill for cities in 2021
 
01:46:24.629 --> 01:46:24.639 align:start position:0%
senate bill 52
 
01:46:27.510 --> 01:46:27.520 align:start position:0%
currently under chapter 32 municipal
 
01:46:28.790 --> 01:46:28.800 align:start position:0%
budget law
 
01:46:31.350 --> 01:46:31.360 align:start position:0%
any local political subdivision of the
 
01:46:31.360 --> 01:46:32.229 align:start position:0%
any local political subdivision of the
state

01:46:32.229 --> 01:46:32.239 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:46:34.709 --> 01:46:34.719 align:start position:0%
whose legislative body raises and
 
01:46:37.350 --> 01:46:37.360 align:start position:0%
appropriates funds through an annual
 
01:46:40.470 --> 01:46:40.480 align:start position:0%
meeting may adopt a tax cap by a
 
01:46:43.590 --> 01:46:43.600 align:start position:0%
three-fifth super-majority vote
 
01:46:45.910 --> 01:46:45.920 align:start position:0%
under a tax cap the total proposed
 
01:46:48.149 --> 01:46:48.159 align:start position:0%
spending of all warrant articles
 
01:46:50.629 --> 01:46:50.639 align:start position:0%
presented by the governing body or
 
01:46:53.350 --> 01:46:53.360 align:start position:0%
budget committee at the annual meeting
 
01:46:56.470 --> 01:46:56.480 align:start position:0%
is limited by the tax cap
 
01:46:59.510 --> 01:46:59.520 align:start position:0%
and the legislative body can override
 
01:47:03.750 --> 01:47:03.760 align:start position:0%
the tax cap with a simple majority vote
 
01:47:06.310 --> 01:47:06.320 align:start position:0%
the purpose of a tax cap is to ensure
 
01:47:09.109 --> 01:47:09.119 align:start position:0%
fiscal responsibility and prudence in
 
01:47:09.119 --> 01:47:10.629 align:start position:0%
fiscal responsibility and prudence in
spending

01:47:10.629 --> 01:47:10.639 align:start position:0%
spending
 
01:47:13.270 --> 01:47:13.280 align:start position:0%
tax caps across the country commonly
 
01:47:15.510 --> 01:47:15.520 align:start position:0%
require a super-majority vote to
 
01:47:15.520 --> 01:47:17.030 align:start position:0%
require a super-majority vote to
override

01:47:17.030 --> 01:47:17.040 align:start position:0%
override
 
01:47:20.870 --> 01:47:20.880 align:start position:0%
the issue that this bill addresses is
 
01:47:24.070 --> 01:47:24.080 align:start position:0%
under current statute a simple majority
 
01:47:27.189 --> 01:47:27.199 align:start position:0%
can override the tax cap which was
 
01:47:30.310 --> 01:47:30.320 align:start position:0%
instituted by a super majority
 
01:47:33.189 --> 01:47:33.199 align:start position:0%
the solution that this bill provides is
 
01:47:36.629 --> 01:47:36.639 align:start position:0%
simple and straightforward
 
01:47:39.590 --> 01:47:39.600 align:start position:0%
requiring a three-fifth supermajority to
 
01:47:41.590 --> 01:47:41.600 align:start position:0%
override the tax cap
 
01:47:44.550 --> 01:47:44.560 align:start position:0%
ensures that any spending that exceeds
 
01:47:48.149 --> 01:47:48.159 align:start position:0%
the tax cap is in fact warranted and is
 
01:47:51.430 --> 01:47:51.440 align:start position:0%
supported by the legislative body of the
 
01:47:53.510 --> 01:47:53.520 align:start position:0%
town or district
 
01:47:56.229 --> 01:47:56.239 align:start position:0%
in addition the provisions of this bill
 
01:47:59.430 --> 01:47:59.440 align:start position:0%
are similar to the provisions of sb 52
 
01:48:02.470 --> 01:48:02.480 align:start position:0%
signed into law last year which requires
 
01:48:06.229 --> 01:48:06.239 align:start position:0%
a super majority vote for city charter
 
01:48:08.870 --> 01:48:08.880 align:start position:0%
exclusions and ordinances that have the
 
01:48:13.750 --> 01:48:13.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:17.430 --> 01:48:17.440 align:start position:0%
additionally the framework of this bill
 
01:48:19.669 --> 01:48:19.679 align:start position:0%
stipulates that in the case of warrant
 
01:48:23.109 --> 01:48:23.119 align:start position:0%
articles proposing bonds notes or other
 
01:48:25.990 --> 01:48:26.000 align:start position:0%
other multi-year expenditures
 
01:48:28.790 --> 01:48:28.800 align:start position:0%
only the first year estimated costs
 
01:48:31.030 --> 01:48:31.040 align:start position:0%
shall be used in calculating
 
01:48:33.189 --> 01:48:33.199 align:start position:0%
appropriations for the purpose of
 
01:48:36.070 --> 01:48:36.080 align:start position:0%
overriding the tax cap
 
01:48:38.390 --> 01:48:38.400 align:start position:0%
this bill outlines the procedures for
 
01:48:41.270 --> 01:48:41.280 align:start position:0%
overriding the tax cap in a municipality
 
01:48:43.430 --> 01:48:43.440 align:start position:0%
that has adopted the official ballot
 
01:48:44.950 --> 01:48:44.960 align:start position:0%
form of meeting
 
01:48:47.590 --> 01:48:47.600 align:start position:0%
and lastly this bill specifies the
 
01:48:50.470 --> 01:48:50.480 align:start position:0%
procedure for overriding the tax cap for
 
01:48:53.189 --> 01:48:53.199 align:start position:0%

194.
 
01:49:03.270 --> 01:49:03.280 align:start position:0%
moreover to be clear this bill does not
 
01:49:06.149 --> 01:49:06.159 align:start position:0%
limit the legislative body's authority
 
01:49:08.870 --> 01:49:08.880 align:start position:0%
to either increase or decrease the
 
01:49:11.750 --> 01:49:11.760 align:start position:0%
amount of any appropriations or the
 
01:49:14.709 --> 01:49:14.719 align:start position:0%
total amount of all appropriations
 
01:49:16.709 --> 01:49:16.719 align:start position:0%
this bill in fact
 
01:49:19.430 --> 01:49:19.440 align:start position:0%
allows the legislative body to increase
 
01:49:21.990 --> 01:49:22.000 align:start position:0%
the amount of any appropriation or the
 
01:49:25.030 --> 01:49:25.040 align:start position:0%
total amount of all pre appropriations
 
01:49:29.510 --> 01:49:29.520 align:start position:0%
by a super majority vote
 
01:49:31.990 --> 01:49:32.000 align:start position:0%
as well as they can decrease the same by
 
01:49:34.310 --> 01:49:34.320 align:start position:0%
the usual procedures applicable to
 
01:49:35.990 --> 01:49:36.000 align:start position:0%
annual meetings
 
01:49:38.870 --> 01:49:38.880 align:start position:0%
it is reasonable that any extraordinary
 
01:49:42.390 --> 01:49:42.400 align:start position:0%
spending which which exceeds the tax cap
 
01:49:45.910 --> 01:49:45.920 align:start position:0%
should have a higher standard to pass
 
01:49:48.390 --> 01:49:48.400 align:start position:0%
moreover a three-fifth super-majority
 
01:49:50.470 --> 01:49:50.480 align:start position:0%
vote is required for bonds and notes in
 
01:49:52.870 --> 01:49:52.880 align:start position:0%
multi-layer year lease agreements
 
01:49:55.589 --> 01:49:55.599 align:start position:0%
without an escape clause
 
01:49:55.599 --> 01:49:56.390 align:start position:0%
without an escape clause
because

01:49:56.390 --> 01:49:56.400 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:49:58.870 --> 01:49:58.880 align:start position:0%
of the extraordinary financial
 
01:49:58.880 --> 01:50:00.550 align:start position:0%
of the extraordinary financial
commitment

01:50:00.550 --> 01:50:00.560 align:start position:0%
commitment
 
01:50:03.470 --> 01:50:03.480 align:start position:0%
the minority needs to have a say when
 
01:50:07.109 --> 01:50:07.119 align:start position:0%
extraordinary spending is proposed
 
01:50:10.149 --> 01:50:10.159 align:start position:0%
finally the current law specifies that
 
01:50:12.310 --> 01:50:12.320 align:start position:0%
cities override tax caps by a
 
01:50:15.350 --> 01:50:15.360 align:start position:0%
super-majority vote to consent to
 
01:50:17.350 --> 01:50:17.360 align:start position:0%
extraordinary spending
 
01:50:19.510 --> 01:50:19.520 align:start position:0%
thus it's logical that a super-majority
 
01:50:21.990 --> 01:50:22.000 align:start position:0%
vote is needed to override a tax cap in
 
01:50:24.390 --> 01:50:24.400 align:start position:0%
school districts towns and village
 
01:50:26.470 --> 01:50:26.480 align:start position:0%
district districts
 
01:50:28.870 --> 01:50:28.880 align:start position:0%
a common approach for all political
 
01:50:30.950 --> 01:50:30.960 align:start position:0%
subdivisions in new hampshire
 
01:50:33.030 --> 01:50:33.040 align:start position:0%
in conclusion
 
01:50:35.350 --> 01:50:35.360 align:start position:0%
this bill establishes a three-fifth
 
01:50:38.390 --> 01:50:38.400 align:start position:0%
super majority to override a local tax
 
01:50:38.400 --> 01:50:39.510 align:start position:0%
super majority to override a local tax
cap

01:50:39.510 --> 01:50:39.520 align:start position:0%
cap
 
01:50:42.070 --> 01:50:42.080 align:start position:0%
this bill allow aligns the vote
 
01:50:46.229 --> 01:50:46.239 align:start position:0%
threshold to both adopt and override a
 
01:50:48.070 --> 01:50:48.080 align:start position:0%
local tax cap
 
01:50:50.870 --> 01:50:50.880 align:start position:0%
and this bill provides this flexibility
 
01:50:53.750 --> 01:50:53.760 align:start position:0%
and spending while maintaining fiscal
 
01:50:56.709 --> 01:50:56.719 align:start position:0%
responsibility to the taxpayers
 
01:50:59.030 --> 01:50:59.040 align:start position:0%

representative powers for taking my
question

01:51:59.189 --> 01:51:59.199 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:52:02.390 --> 01:52:02.400 align:start position:0%
so how would this impact cities where
 
01:52:05.189 --> 01:52:05.199 align:start position:0%
it's not town meeting
 
01:52:07.109 --> 01:52:07.119 align:start position:0%
voting for
 
01:52:09.750 --> 01:52:09.760 align:start position:0%

it won't affect the
cities

01:52:12.390 --> 01:52:12.400 align:start position:0%

representative if i understand your
 
01:52:17.109 --> 01:52:17.119 align:start position:0%
question correctly
 
01:52:20.709 --> 01:52:20.719 align:start position:0%
this bill pertains exclusively
 
01:52:23.430 --> 01:52:23.440 align:start position:0%
to towns districts
 
01:52:25.189 --> 01:52:25.199 align:start position:0%
which could be a school district or a
 
01:52:26.709 --> 01:52:26.719 align:start position:0%
village district
 
01:52:30.229 --> 01:52:30.239 align:start position:0%
last year in 2021 there was a analogous
 
01:52:35.510 --> 01:52:35.520 align:start position:0%
bill senate bill 52 which pertained to
 
01:52:40.229 --> 01:52:40.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:40.239 --> 01:52:41.350 align:start position:0%
 
follow-up

01:52:41.350 --> 01:52:41.360 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
01:52:44.950 --> 01:52:44.960 align:start position:0%
no two a question for you are you gonna
 
01:52:44.960 --> 01:52:46.390 align:start position:0%
no two a question for you are you gonna
yeah

01:52:46.390 --> 01:52:46.400 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:52:48.390 --> 01:52:48.400 align:start position:0%
good man
 
01:52:50.709 --> 01:52:50.719 align:start position:0%
yes representative go right ahead
 
01:52:51.910 --> 01:52:51.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you
 
01:52:54.310 --> 01:52:54.320 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question uh
 
01:52:56.149 --> 01:52:56.159 align:start position:0%
mine is gonna be a little bit obscure
 
01:52:56.159 --> 01:52:57.109 align:start position:0%
mine is gonna be a little bit obscure
but

01:52:57.109 --> 01:52:57.119 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:52:58.709 --> 01:52:58.719 align:start position:0%
we've heard from
 
01:53:02.229 --> 01:53:02.239 align:start position:0%
several other uh bills that town's
 
01:53:05.270 --> 01:53:05.280 align:start position:0%
laws should be um
 
01:53:08.149 --> 01:53:08.159 align:start position:0%
not mandated but uh enabling
 
01:53:10.550 --> 01:53:10.560 align:start position:0%
so why is it the ones that we've decided
 
01:53:13.030 --> 01:53:13.040 align:start position:0%
should be enabling which is most of them
 
01:53:15.030 --> 01:53:15.040 align:start position:0%
why does this one
 
01:53:18.149 --> 01:53:18.159 align:start position:0%
propose to make it a statewide mandate
 
01:53:20.229 --> 01:53:20.239 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for asking that
 
01:53:22.629 --> 01:53:22.639 align:start position:0%
question that's that's an important
 
01:53:22.639 --> 01:53:23.589 align:start position:0%
question that's that's an important
point

01:53:23.589 --> 01:53:23.599 align:start position:0%
point
 
01:53:27.669 --> 01:53:27.679 align:start position:0%
so this bill
 
01:53:31.350 --> 01:53:31.360 align:start position:0%
currently under current statute
 
01:53:34.870 --> 01:53:34.880 align:start position:0%
local tax caps are enabling
 
01:53:37.589 --> 01:53:37.599 align:start position:0%
a town a district
 
01:53:37.599 --> 01:53:38.870 align:start position:0%
a town a district
can

01:53:38.870 --> 01:53:38.880 align:start position:0%
can
 
01:53:40.550 --> 01:53:40.560 align:start position:0%
choose to adopt
 
01:53:42.550 --> 01:53:42.560 align:start position:0%
a local tax cap
 
01:53:44.550 --> 01:53:44.560 align:start position:0%
by a three-fifth super-majority vote
 
01:53:47.510 --> 01:53:47.520 align:start position:0%
it's enabling it goes on to the warrant
 
01:53:49.589 --> 01:53:49.599 align:start position:0%
and the voters
 
01:53:52.550 --> 01:53:52.560 align:start position:0%
choose to adopt it or not
 
01:53:55.189 --> 01:53:55.199 align:start position:0%
what this legislation here
 
01:53:57.750 --> 01:53:57.760 align:start position:0%
proposes to do is to
 
01:53:57.760 --> 01:53:59.109 align:start position:0%
proposes to do is to
require

01:53:59.109 --> 01:53:59.119 align:start position:0%
require
 
01:54:01.030 --> 01:54:01.040 align:start position:0%
that the vote threshold
 
01:54:04.390 --> 01:54:04.400 align:start position:0%
for overriding the tax cap obvious
 
01:54:06.709 --> 01:54:06.719 align:start position:0%
obviously also be a three-fifths
 
01:54:08.870 --> 01:54:08.880 align:start position:0%
majority so it's not
 
01:54:11.189 --> 01:54:11.199 align:start position:0%
it's not new legislation
 
01:54:11.199 --> 01:54:12.709 align:start position:0%
it's not new legislation
it's

01:54:12.709 --> 01:54:12.719 align:start position:0%
it's
 
01:54:15.510 --> 01:54:15.520 align:start position:0%
it's aligning the standard
 
01:54:18.470 --> 01:54:18.480 align:start position:0%
so that there's actual teeth in the tax
 
01:54:18.480 --> 01:54:20.550 align:start position:0%
so that there's actual teeth in the tax
cap

01:54:20.550 --> 01:54:20.560 align:start position:0%
cap
 
01:54:23.990 --> 01:54:24.000 align:start position:0%
yes go ahead thank you for the answer um
 
01:54:26.790 --> 01:54:26.800 align:start position:0%
my follow-up is um
 
01:54:29.030 --> 01:54:29.040 align:start position:0%
your response to representative klee
 
01:54:31.990 --> 01:54:32.000 align:start position:0%
about um town manage uh town meetings
 
01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:32.870 align:start position:0%
about um town manage uh town meetings
where

01:54:32.870 --> 01:54:32.880 align:start position:0%
where
 
01:54:36.390 --> 01:54:36.400 align:start position:0%
uh is it uh the vote of those present or
 
01:54:39.350 --> 01:54:39.360 align:start position:0%
those who can vote what about sb2 towns
 
01:54:39.360 --> 01:54:40.709 align:start position:0%
those who can vote what about sb2 towns
where

01:54:40.709 --> 01:54:40.719 align:start position:0%
where
 
01:54:42.709 --> 01:54:42.719 align:start position:0%
you'd have to have a separate
 
01:54:44.629 --> 01:54:44.639 align:start position:0%
meeting to
 
01:54:48.950 --> 01:54:48.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:50.550 --> 01:54:50.560 align:start position:0%
thank you for that question
 
01:54:53.270 --> 01:54:53.280 align:start position:0%
um the framework of this bill
 
01:54:54.629 --> 01:54:54.639 align:start position:0%
does address
 
01:54:57.669 --> 01:54:57.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:59.910 --> 01:54:59.920 align:start position:0%
so that is addressed
 
01:55:03.669 --> 01:55:03.679 align:start position:0%
in lines eight section b of the um bill
 
01:55:07.910 --> 01:55:07.920 align:start position:0%
language beginning on page on line 18.
 
01:55:09.669 --> 01:55:09.679 align:start position:0%
so it
 
01:55:11.270 --> 01:55:11.280 align:start position:0%
it does address
 
01:55:14.470 --> 01:55:14.480 align:start position:0%
the traditional town meeting as well as
 
01:55:17.669 --> 01:55:17.679 align:start position:0%
the official ballot form of meeting
 
01:55:19.350 --> 01:55:19.360 align:start position:0%
as well as
 
01:55:21.910 --> 01:55:21.920 align:start position:0%
school districts that have adopted the
 
01:55:27.830 --> 01:55:27.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:30.390 --> 01:55:30.400 align:start position:0%
yes representative manchuri
 
01:55:31.430 --> 01:55:31.440 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you
 
01:55:32.950 --> 01:55:32.960 align:start position:0%
representative taking my question i'm
 
01:55:34.870 --> 01:55:34.880 align:start position:0%
looking to make sure i understand it
 
01:55:37.109 --> 01:55:37.119 align:start position:0%
correctly under parent a
 
01:55:39.510 --> 01:55:39.520 align:start position:0%
warrant articles of proposing bonds or
 
01:55:41.990 --> 01:55:42.000 align:start position:0%
notes only the first year
 
01:55:45.109 --> 01:55:45.119 align:start position:0%
shall be included so for instance my
 
01:55:47.589 --> 01:55:47.599 align:start position:0%
town is proposing a bond a 30-year bond
 
01:55:49.270 --> 01:55:49.280 align:start position:0%
first year's payment
 
01:55:51.589 --> 01:55:51.599 align:start position:0%
200-plus thousand dollars second and
 
01:55:53.270 --> 01:55:53.280 align:start position:0%
subsequent year's payments could be as
 
01:55:54.470 --> 01:55:54.480 align:start position:0%
high as
 
01:55:56.950 --> 01:55:56.960 align:start position:0%
400 000
 
01:55:58.870 --> 01:55:58.880 align:start position:0%
so if three years from now there's going
 
01:56:00.950 --> 01:56:00.960 align:start position:0%
to be a tax cap only the first year
 
01:56:02.550 --> 01:56:02.560 align:start position:0%
payment would be the one that would be
 
01:56:02.560 --> 01:56:04.149 align:start position:0%
payment would be the one that would be
applicable

01:56:04.149 --> 01:56:04.159 align:start position:0%
applicable
 
01:56:06.229 --> 01:56:06.239 align:start position:0%
that is correct for the current for the
 
01:56:08.870 --> 01:56:08.880 align:start position:0%
current year at which the legislative
 
01:56:08.880 --> 01:56:09.910 align:start position:0%
current year at which the legislative
body

01:56:09.910 --> 01:56:09.920 align:start position:0%
body
 
01:56:09.920 --> 01:56:12.950 align:start position:0%
body
is

01:56:12.950 --> 01:56:12.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:15.430 --> 01:56:15.440 align:start position:0%
passing the warrant articles
 
01:56:17.589 --> 01:56:17.599 align:start position:0%
yes that section a
 
01:56:19.430 --> 01:56:19.440 align:start position:0%
stipulates that
 
01:56:22.470 --> 01:56:22.480 align:start position:0%
for bonds notes and other multi-year
 
01:56:26.550 --> 01:56:26.560 align:start position:0%
expenditures only the first year
 
01:56:28.070 --> 01:56:28.080 align:start position:0%
of those
 
01:56:31.189 --> 01:56:31.199 align:start position:0%
bonds notes or expenditures is
 
01:56:35.030 --> 01:56:35.040 align:start position:0%
used in the calculation of the tax cap
 
01:56:36.709 --> 01:56:36.719 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:56:39.270 --> 01:56:39.280 align:start position:0%
is catherine heck in the audience
 
01:56:41.030 --> 01:56:41.040 align:start position:0%

01:57:16.950 --> 01:57:16.960 align:start position:0%
currently have a tax cap and do you know
 
01:57:19.350 --> 01:57:19.360 align:start position:0%
what that range would be
 
01:57:20.629 --> 01:57:20.639 align:start position:0%
yes thank you for the question
 
01:57:23.669 --> 01:57:23.679 align:start position:0%
representative so currently based on my
 
01:57:23.679 --> 01:57:24.950 align:start position:0%
representative so currently based on my
research

01:57:24.950 --> 01:57:24.960 align:start position:0%
research
 
01:57:27.990 --> 01:57:28.000 align:start position:0%
towns with tax caps there are four
 
01:57:30.310 --> 01:57:30.320 align:start position:0%
and i could list them if you would like
 
01:57:33.030 --> 01:57:33.040 align:start position:0%
allstate litchfield milton and newport
 
01:57:35.350 --> 01:57:35.360 align:start position:0%
in school districts with tax caps there
 
01:57:36.629 --> 01:57:36.639 align:start position:0%
are three
 
01:57:38.870 --> 01:57:38.880 align:start position:0%
that is that they would be claremont
 
01:57:41.430 --> 01:57:41.440 align:start position:0%
local brookline and newfound era
 
01:57:41.440 --> 01:57:43.750 align:start position:0%
local brookline and newfound era
regional

01:57:43.750 --> 01:57:43.760 align:start position:0%
regional
 
01:57:45.109 --> 01:57:45.119 align:start position:0%
follow up yes
 
01:57:47.830 --> 01:57:47.840 align:start position:0%
and uh what what is the range of the cat
 
01:57:50.790 --> 01:57:50.800 align:start position:0%
tax cap what percentage
 
01:57:52.470 --> 01:57:52.480 align:start position:0%
thank you for that follow-up
 
01:57:54.070 --> 01:57:54.080 align:start position:0%
so um
 
01:57:57.270 --> 01:57:57.280 align:start position:0%
tax caps can be a fixed dollar amount or
 
01:58:01.350 --> 01:58:01.360 align:start position:0%
a percentage i did not research
 
01:58:01.360 --> 01:58:02.470 align:start position:0%
a percentage i did not research
that

01:58:02.470 --> 01:58:02.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:58:05.109 --> 01:58:05.119 align:start position:0%
data point that you're asking but i do i
 
01:58:07.669 --> 01:58:07.679 align:start position:0%
can share that in the brookline school
 
01:58:10.629 --> 01:58:10.639 align:start position:0%
district our tax cap is eight percent

um
 
01:58:17.830 --> 01:58:17.840 align:start position:0%
school districts in particular that's
 
01:58:19.270 --> 01:58:19.280 align:start position:0%
what i'm familiar with they get a lot of
 
01:58:22.070 --> 01:58:22.080 align:start position:0%
revenue that's not raised by by local
 
01:58:23.669 --> 01:58:23.679 align:start position:0%
property tax they might get it from the
 
01:58:26.070 --> 01:58:26.080 align:start position:0%
federal government they may get grants
 
01:58:26.080 --> 01:58:27.109 align:start position:0%
federal government they may get grants
whatever

01:58:27.109 --> 01:58:27.119 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
01:58:27.119 --> 01:58:28.070 align:start position:0%
whatever
um

01:58:28.070 --> 01:58:28.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:58:30.790 --> 01:58:30.800 align:start position:0%
is are those revenue sources
 
01:58:34.950 --> 01:58:34.960 align:start position:0%
subject to the tax cap or is it only
 
01:58:37.830 --> 01:58:37.840 align:start position:0%
that spending which israel is raised by
 
01:58:40.070 --> 01:58:40.080 align:start position:0%
local property taxes
 
01:58:41.030 --> 01:58:41.040 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
01:58:43.430 --> 01:58:43.440 align:start position:0%
representative so my understanding with
 
01:58:45.990 --> 01:58:46.000 align:start position:0%
regard to municipal budget law
 
01:58:49.910 --> 01:58:49.920 align:start position:0%
is that there is a max appropriation
 
01:58:52.950 --> 01:58:52.960 align:start position:0%
per the tax cap and so that would be
 
01:58:52.960 --> 01:58:54.790 align:start position:0%
per the tax cap and so that would be
calculated

01:58:54.790 --> 01:58:54.800 align:start position:0%
calculated
 
01:58:56.709 --> 01:58:56.719 align:start position:0%
in part where you would have to
 
01:59:00.550 --> 01:59:00.560 align:start position:0%
calculate the maximum tax effort
 
01:59:02.390 --> 01:59:02.400 align:start position:0%
and then you would have to include
 
01:59:02.400 --> 01:59:04.390 align:start position:0%
and then you would have to include
appropriations

01:59:04.390 --> 01:59:04.400 align:start position:0%
appropriations
 
01:59:06.550 --> 01:59:06.560 align:start position:0%
in order um
 
01:59:06.560 --> 01:59:07.270 align:start position:0%
in order um
to

01:59:07.270 --> 01:59:07.280 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:59:07.280 --> 01:59:08.550 align:start position:0%
to
determine

01:59:08.550 --> 01:59:08.560 align:start position:0%
determine
 
01:59:11.750 --> 01:59:11.760 align:start position:0%
the maximum appropriations per the tax
 
01:59:11.760 --> 01:59:12.790 align:start position:0%
the maximum appropriations per the tax
crap

01:59:12.790 --> 01:59:12.800 align:start position:0%
crap
 
01:59:12.800 --> 01:59:14.149 align:start position:0%
crap
cap

01:59:14.149 --> 01:59:14.159 align:start position:0%
cap
 
01:59:17.189 --> 01:59:17.199 align:start position:0%
excuse me
 
01:59:18.629 --> 01:59:18.639 align:start position:0%
easy for you to say
 
01:59:20.550 --> 01:59:20.560 align:start position:0%
sorry thank you
 
01:59:22.550 --> 01:59:22.560 align:start position:0%
representative stavis
 
01:59:23.990 --> 01:59:24.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you
 
01:59:25.669 --> 01:59:25.679 align:start position:0%
representative i'm sorry having trouble
 
01:59:26.790 --> 01:59:26.800 align:start position:0%
seeing you
 
01:59:29.270 --> 01:59:29.280 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
01:59:32.149 --> 01:59:32.159 align:start position:0%
you just you did some research and
 
01:59:35.109 --> 01:59:35.119 align:start position:0%
counted up the number of towns
 
01:59:37.270 --> 01:59:37.280 align:start position:0%
and cities in new hampshire currently
 
01:59:40.149 --> 01:59:40.159 align:start position:0%
have cap tax caps and i was
 
01:59:43.510 --> 01:59:43.520 align:start position:0%
astounded that there are so few
 
01:59:44.790 --> 01:59:44.800 align:start position:0%
do you
 
01:59:46.709 --> 01:59:46.719 align:start position:0%
do you have any sense of
 
01:59:46.719 --> 01:59:47.669 align:start position:0%
do you have any sense of
why

01:59:47.669 --> 01:59:47.679 align:start position:0%
why
 
01:59:51.189 --> 01:59:51.199 align:start position:0%
if tax caps are such a great thing that
 
01:59:55.830 --> 01:59:55.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:57.510 --> 01:59:57.520 align:start position:0%
um i can and thank you for the question
 
01:59:57.520 --> 01:59:59.030 align:start position:0%
um i can and thank you for the question
representative

01:59:59.030 --> 01:59:59.040 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:00:00.950 --> 02:00:00.960 align:start position:0%
so with regard to that it would it would
 
02:00:03.669 --> 02:00:03.679 align:start position:0%
be my opinion or supposition you know
 
02:00:06.390 --> 02:00:06.400 align:start position:0%
obviously i have not done research to
 
02:00:08.149 --> 02:00:08.159 align:start position:0%
you know query
 
02:00:11.109 --> 02:00:11.119 align:start position:0%
the different uh towns and districts as
 
02:00:14.390 --> 02:00:14.400 align:start position:0%
to why they do not have a tax cap but i
 
02:00:14.400 --> 02:00:15.109 align:start position:0%
to why they do not have a tax cap but i
could

02:00:15.109 --> 02:00:15.119 align:start position:0%
could
 
02:00:16.390 --> 02:00:16.400 align:start position:0%
share with you
 
02:00:16.400 --> 02:00:18.790 align:start position:0%
share with you
that

02:00:18.790 --> 02:00:18.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:21.350 --> 02:00:21.360 align:start position:0%
normally how
 
02:00:23.510 --> 02:00:23.520 align:start position:0%
articles get on the warrant is through
 
02:00:25.669 --> 02:00:25.679 align:start position:0%
the governing body
 
02:00:25.679 --> 02:00:27.189 align:start position:0%
the governing body
so

02:00:27.189 --> 02:00:27.199 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:00:29.109 --> 02:00:29.119 align:start position:0%
it would be up to the governing body and
 
02:00:31.430 --> 02:00:31.440 align:start position:0%
in general governing bodies in my
 
02:00:31.440 --> 02:00:32.790 align:start position:0%
in general governing bodies in my
opinion

02:00:32.790 --> 02:00:32.800 align:start position:0%
opinion
 
02:00:33.750 --> 02:00:33.760 align:start position:0%
you know
 
02:00:36.470 --> 02:00:36.480 align:start position:0%
don't want you know aren't
 
02:00:39.030 --> 02:00:39.040 align:start position:0%
probably interested in in tax caps they
 
02:00:42.149 --> 02:00:42.159 align:start position:0%
just want to do and you know what they
 
02:00:43.270 --> 02:00:43.280 align:start position:0%
want to do
 
02:00:45.350 --> 02:00:45.360 align:start position:0%
and so therefore
 
02:00:48.070 --> 02:00:48.080 align:start position:0%
tax caps would have to the other
 
02:00:51.669 --> 02:00:51.679 align:start position:0%
alternative was to would be to put that
 
02:00:53.830 --> 02:00:53.840 align:start position:0%
article enabling legislation on the
 
02:00:56.550 --> 02:00:56.560 align:start position:0%
warrant by a petitioned warrant article
 
02:00:58.229 --> 02:00:58.239 align:start position:0%
by citizens
 
02:01:00.070 --> 02:01:00.080 align:start position:0%
i can
 
02:01:03.109 --> 02:01:03.119 align:start position:0%
tell you that that is exactly how
 
02:01:05.430 --> 02:01:05.440 align:start position:0%
the tax cap in the brookline school
 
02:01:07.510 --> 02:01:07.520 align:start position:0%
district came to be it was through
 
02:01:12.870 --> 02:01:12.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:12.880 --> 02:01:14.709 align:start position:0%
 
representative

02:01:14.709 --> 02:01:14.719 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:01:16.229 --> 02:01:16.239 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
02:01:17.990 --> 02:01:18.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
02:01:20.950 --> 02:01:20.960 align:start position:0%
on line 15 uh there's a phrase here that
 
02:01:23.109 --> 02:01:23.119 align:start position:0%
says multi-year expenditures could you
 
02:01:28.390 --> 02:01:28.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:30.629 --> 02:01:30.639 align:start position:0%
um a multi an example oh thank you for
 
02:01:32.470 --> 02:01:32.480 align:start position:0%
the question representative an example
 
02:01:35.510 --> 02:01:35.520 align:start position:0%
of a multi-year expenditure would be a
 
02:01:37.430 --> 02:01:37.440 align:start position:0%
lease a lease agreement
 
02:01:39.030 --> 02:01:39.040 align:start position:0%
in which there may or may not be an
 
02:01:40.870 --> 02:01:40.880 align:start position:0%
escape clause
 
02:01:43.030 --> 02:01:43.040 align:start position:0%
renting equipment
 
02:01:45.669 --> 02:01:45.679 align:start position:0%
for example i'm aware
 
02:01:48.149 --> 02:01:48.159 align:start position:0%
in in brookline school district that

thank you mr chair thank you
 
02:02:07.830 --> 02:02:07.840 align:start position:0%
representative for taking a another
 
02:02:11.589 --> 02:02:11.599 align:start position:0%
question um just in terms of looking at
 
02:02:11.599 --> 02:02:12.790 align:start position:0%
question um just in terms of looking at
number

02:02:12.790 --> 02:02:12.800 align:start position:0%
number
 
02:02:14.790 --> 02:02:14.800 align:start position:0%
four towns three
 
02:02:14.800 --> 02:02:16.070 align:start position:0%
four towns three
saus

02:02:16.070 --> 02:02:16.080 align:start position:0%
saus
 
02:02:19.510 --> 02:02:19.520 align:start position:0%
and totally how many towns and saus do
 
02:02:20.709 --> 02:02:20.719 align:start position:0%
we have
 
02:02:22.629 --> 02:02:22.639 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire what percent i mean
 
02:02:25.510 --> 02:02:25.520 align:start position:0%
this is a small percentage of what we
 
02:02:27.109 --> 02:02:27.119 align:start position:0%
have in new hampshire
 
02:02:29.510 --> 02:02:29.520 align:start position:0%
to mandate that
 
02:02:31.750 --> 02:02:31.760 align:start position:0%
from the state level don't you think
 
02:02:34.229 --> 02:02:34.239 align:start position:0%
that is
 
02:02:34.239 --> 02:02:35.669 align:start position:0%
that is
um

02:02:35.669 --> 02:02:35.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:02:38.629 --> 02:02:38.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:38.639 --> 02:02:39.990 align:start position:0%
 
restrictive

02:02:39.990 --> 02:02:40.000 align:start position:0%
restrictive
 
02:02:42.950 --> 02:02:42.960 align:start position:0%
or not quite enabling thank you for the
 
02:02:47.350 --> 02:02:47.360 align:start position:0%
question representative so um
 
02:02:49.350 --> 02:02:49.360 align:start position:0%
my recollection is that there are
 
02:02:51.709 --> 02:02:51.719 align:start position:0%
approximately 246
 
02:02:53.910 --> 02:02:53.920 align:start position:0%
municipalities in the state of new
 
02:02:56.790 --> 02:02:56.800 align:start position:0%
hampshire i do not have the data point
 
02:02:56.800 --> 02:02:57.589 align:start position:0%
hampshire i do not have the data point
um

02:02:57.589 --> 02:02:57.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:03:00.709 --> 02:03:00.719 align:start position:0%
with regard to how many school districts
 
02:03:01.910 --> 02:03:01.920 align:start position:0%
there are
 
02:03:04.470 --> 02:03:04.480 align:start position:0%
so therefore i you know i did not do the
 
02:03:06.870 --> 02:03:06.880 align:start position:0%
type of calculation that that you're
 
02:03:08.229 --> 02:03:08.239 align:start position:0%
asking me about
 
02:03:09.910 --> 02:03:09.920 align:start position:0%
but you did
 
02:03:12.070 --> 02:03:12.080 align:start position:0%
ask me if i feel that this is
 
02:03:15.510 --> 02:03:15.520 align:start position:0%
restrictive i will reiterate that a tax
 
02:03:15.520 --> 02:03:16.390 align:start position:0%
restrictive i will reiterate that a tax
cap

02:03:16.390 --> 02:03:16.400 align:start position:0%
cap
 
02:03:16.400 --> 02:03:17.990 align:start position:0%
cap
is

02:03:17.990 --> 02:03:18.000 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:03:20.390 --> 02:03:20.400 align:start position:0%
enabling legislation
 
02:03:23.109 --> 02:03:23.119 align:start position:0%
and the purpose of this
 
02:03:24.950 --> 02:03:24.960 align:start position:0%
is to
 
02:03:27.350 --> 02:03:27.360 align:start position:0%
give taxpayers
 
02:03:30.310 --> 02:03:30.320 align:start position:0%
tools in their tool box
 
02:03:30.320 --> 02:03:31.350 align:start position:0%
tools in their tool box
to

02:03:31.350 --> 02:03:31.360 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:03:34.310 --> 02:03:34.320 align:start position:0%
control spending and in short
 
02:03:34.320 --> 02:03:35.350 align:start position:0%
control spending and in short
this

02:03:35.350 --> 02:03:35.360 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:03:38.550 --> 02:03:38.560 align:start position:0%
super majority requirement to override a
 
02:03:41.990 --> 02:03:42.000 align:start position:0%
tax cap puts teeth into the tax cap
 
02:03:45.430 --> 02:03:45.440 align:start position:0%
because currently right now
 
02:03:47.750 --> 02:03:47.760 align:start position:0%
you have the starting point
 
02:03:49.750 --> 02:03:49.760 align:start position:0%
of the
 
02:03:51.669 --> 02:03:51.679 align:start position:0%
total appropriations that are brought
 
02:03:53.990 --> 02:03:54.000 align:start position:0%
forward to the legislative body by the
 
02:03:56.709 --> 02:03:56.719 align:start position:0%
governing body or the budget committee
 
02:03:56.719 --> 02:03:57.910 align:start position:0%
governing body or the budget committee
and

02:03:57.910 --> 02:03:57.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:03:59.030 --> 02:03:59.040 align:start position:0%
it can be
 
02:04:05.030 --> 02:04:05.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:07.669 --> 02:04:07.679 align:start position:0%
representative gilman
 
02:04:08.950 --> 02:04:08.960 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you
 
02:04:11.430 --> 02:04:11.440 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question uh
 
02:04:13.910 --> 02:04:13.920 align:start position:0%
uh early or maybe just this last
 
02:04:15.589 --> 02:04:15.599 align:start position:0%
sentence um
 
02:04:18.069 --> 02:04:18.079 align:start position:0%
he stated that the governing body is the
 
02:04:20.709 --> 02:04:20.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:23.109 --> 02:04:23.119 align:start position:0%
is out of is in control of whether or
 
02:04:26.950 --> 02:04:26.960 align:start position:0%
not a town uh institutes a tax cap but
 
02:04:29.109 --> 02:04:29.119 align:start position:0%
isn't it really the legislative body
 
02:04:31.189 --> 02:04:31.199 align:start position:0%
that does this thank you thank you for
 
02:04:33.669 --> 02:04:33.679 align:start position:0%
the question they vote on the question
 
02:04:36.310 --> 02:04:36.320 align:start position:0%
they don't just say the governing body
 
02:04:37.350 --> 02:04:37.360 align:start position:0%
can't say
 
02:04:39.270 --> 02:04:39.280 align:start position:0%
we're doing a tax cap
 
02:04:41.109 --> 02:04:41.119 align:start position:0%
they have to recommend for it to be put
 
02:04:43.030 --> 02:04:43.040 align:start position:0%
on the warrant
 
02:04:43.990 --> 02:04:44.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
02:04:46.149 --> 02:04:46.159 align:start position:0%
representative i'm not sure that i
 
02:04:49.750 --> 02:04:49.760 align:start position:0%
understand the question as you um posed
 
02:04:53.990 --> 02:04:54.000 align:start position:0%
it if i did mistake misspeak i apologize
 
02:04:57.350 --> 02:04:57.360 align:start position:0%
clearly it's the legislative body that
 
02:04:59.990 --> 02:05:00.000 align:start position:0%
votes to approve or
 
02:05:01.669 --> 02:05:01.679 align:start position:0%
just deny
 
02:05:03.750 --> 02:05:03.760 align:start position:0%
a local tax cap
 
02:05:06.069 --> 02:05:06.079 align:start position:0%
it is not the governing body
 
02:05:06.079 --> 02:05:06.790 align:start position:0%
it is not the governing body
what

02:05:06.790 --> 02:05:06.800 align:start position:0%
what
 
02:05:08.629 --> 02:05:08.639 align:start position:0%
my reference maybe perhaps to the
 
02:05:10.470 --> 02:05:10.480 align:start position:0%
governing body was that the governing
 
02:05:12.870 --> 02:05:12.880 align:start position:0%
body is what brings forward
 
02:05:14.870 --> 02:05:14.880 align:start position:0%
you know the warrant articles and total
 
02:05:17.030 --> 02:05:17.040 align:start position:0%
appropriations and in the case of a
 
02:05:19.030 --> 02:05:19.040 align:start position:0%
school district in which there is an
 
02:05:21.589 --> 02:05:21.599 align:start position:0%
official budget committee it would be
 
02:05:24.229 --> 02:05:24.239 align:start position:0%
the budget committee who quote unquote
 
02:05:24.239 --> 02:05:25.270 align:start position:0%
the budget committee who quote unquote
owns

02:05:25.270 --> 02:05:25.280 align:start position:0%
owns
 
02:05:27.750 --> 02:05:27.760 align:start position:0%
the operating budget and it is not
 
02:05:30.149 --> 02:05:30.159 align:start position:0%
brought forward or proposed by the
 
02:05:30.159 --> 02:05:31.109 align:start position:0%
brought forward or proposed by the
school

02:05:31.109 --> 02:05:31.119 align:start position:0%
school
 
02:05:33.589 --> 02:05:33.599 align:start position:0%
board gov which is the governing body in
 
02:05:35.430 --> 02:05:35.440 align:start position:0%
that case
 
02:05:36.790 --> 02:05:36.800 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:05:39.189 --> 02:05:39.199 align:start position:0%
thank you representative power
 
02:05:40.790 --> 02:05:40.800 align:start position:0%
i appreciate it appreciate your
 
02:05:43.830 --> 02:05:43.840 align:start position:0%
testimony we're going to hear now from
 
02:05:45.830 --> 02:05:45.840 align:start position:0%
catherine heck
 
02:06:12.629 --> 02:06:12.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:14.629 --> 02:06:14.639 align:start position:0%
good morning good morning mr chairman
 
02:06:16.470 --> 02:06:16.480 align:start position:0%
and committee members thank you
 
02:06:18.790 --> 02:06:18.800 align:start position:0%
for allowing me to speak today
 
02:06:20.550 --> 02:06:20.560 align:start position:0%
my name is catherine heck for the record
 
02:06:21.910 --> 02:06:21.920 align:start position:0%
and i represent the new hampshire
 
02:06:25.109 --> 02:06:25.119 align:start position:0%
municipal association and we are taking
 
02:06:27.990 --> 02:06:28.000 align:start position:0%
a position of opposition to this bill
 
02:06:30.069 --> 02:06:30.079 align:start position:0%
for the reasons that currently there are
 
02:06:32.390 --> 02:06:32.400 align:start position:0%
in fact four municipalities that have
 
02:06:35.109 --> 02:06:35.119 align:start position:0%
adopted a local tax cap provision and
 
02:06:37.589 --> 02:06:37.599 align:start position:0%
the purpose of the tax cap is to limit
 
02:06:40.069 --> 02:06:40.079 align:start position:0%
the budget authority of the elected
 
02:06:42.229 --> 02:06:42.239 align:start position:0%
governing body whether it's the board of
 
02:06:46.229 --> 02:06:46.239 align:start position:0%
selectmen or the budget committee
 
02:06:47.669 --> 02:06:47.679 align:start position:0%
the tax cap
 
02:06:47.679 --> 02:06:48.790 align:start position:0%
the tax cap
limits

02:06:48.790 --> 02:06:48.800 align:start position:0%
limits
 
02:06:50.310 --> 02:06:50.320 align:start position:0%
the budget amount that they can bring
 
02:06:53.510 --> 02:06:53.520 align:start position:0%
forward in the town meeting
 
02:06:56.069 --> 02:06:56.079 align:start position:0%
however once the budget is presented the
 
02:06:58.950 --> 02:06:58.960 align:start position:0%
town meeting is in the hands or the sb2
 
02:07:00.629 --> 02:07:00.639 align:start position:0%
meeting is in the hands of the voter the
 
02:07:02.709 --> 02:07:02.719 align:start position:0%
legislative body and they should be able
 
02:07:05.109 --> 02:07:05.119 align:start position:0%
to make their own decision based on the
 
02:07:07.109 --> 02:07:07.119 align:start position:0%
usual procedures of an annual meeting
 
02:07:09.270 --> 02:07:09.280 align:start position:0%
which is through simple majority
 
02:07:13.669 --> 02:07:13.679 align:start position:0%
this bill well it does still allow for a
 
02:07:15.350 --> 02:07:15.360 align:start position:0%
majority to
 
02:07:17.430 --> 02:07:17.440 align:start position:0%
override a tax cap it makes it more
 
02:07:17.440 --> 02:07:18.870 align:start position:0%
override a tax cap it makes it more
difficult

02:07:18.870 --> 02:07:18.880 align:start position:0%
difficult
 
02:07:18.880 --> 02:07:19.830 align:start position:0%
difficult
we

02:07:19.830 --> 02:07:19.840 align:start position:0%
we
 
02:07:22.069 --> 02:07:22.079 align:start position:0%
our presumption is that
 
02:07:23.030 --> 02:07:23.040 align:start position:0%
there was
 
02:07:25.189 --> 02:07:25.199 align:start position:0%
a level of comfort or discomfort giving
 
02:07:26.870 --> 02:07:26.880 align:start position:0%
the elected body
 
02:07:29.669 --> 02:07:29.679 align:start position:0%
the provision to present whatever budget
 
02:07:33.270 --> 02:07:33.280 align:start position:0%
it felt necessary and therefore in the
 
02:07:35.430 --> 02:07:35.440 align:start position:0%
four cases that we can find a petition
 
02:07:38.149 --> 02:07:38.159 align:start position:0%
warrant article was brought forth by the
 
02:07:41.189 --> 02:07:41.199 align:start position:0%
voters to create a tax cap under that
 
02:07:42.870 --> 02:07:42.880 align:start position:0%
provision in which the four towns
 
02:07:45.669 --> 02:07:45.679 align:start position:0%
adopted the tax cap it was under that a
 
02:07:47.910 --> 02:07:47.920 align:start position:0%
simple majority could then at the annual
 
02:07:51.350 --> 02:07:51.360 align:start position:0%
meeting bring forward um an approp an
 
02:07:53.510 --> 02:07:53.520 align:start position:0%
increase in appropriation and certainly
 
02:07:55.669 --> 02:07:55.679 align:start position:0%
without a tax cap at any time the
 
02:07:57.430 --> 02:07:57.440 align:start position:0%
legislative body can decrease
 
02:07:59.750 --> 02:07:59.760 align:start position:0%
appropriations or change appropriations
 
02:08:01.990 --> 02:08:02.000 align:start position:0%
on the floor of town meeting i did want
 
02:08:03.830 --> 02:08:03.840 align:start position:0%
to briefly touch upon a question that
 
02:08:06.629 --> 02:08:06.639 align:start position:0%
was asked by representative majori about
 
02:08:09.510 --> 02:08:09.520 align:start position:0%
the first year of bonds notes or other
 
02:08:11.830 --> 02:08:11.840 align:start position:0%
lease expenditures being included in
 
02:08:13.430 --> 02:08:13.440 align:start position:0%
that calculation
 
02:08:13.440 --> 02:08:14.229 align:start position:0%
that calculation
and

02:08:14.229 --> 02:08:14.239 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:08:16.310 --> 02:08:16.320 align:start position:0%
well that is
 
02:08:18.470 --> 02:08:18.480 align:start position:0%
exactly how the bill reads i think the
 
02:08:20.790 --> 02:08:20.800 align:start position:0%
reason why tax cap becomes challenging
 
02:08:23.510 --> 02:08:23.520 align:start position:0%
is because in subsequent years your tax
 
02:08:24.950 --> 02:08:24.960 align:start position:0%
cap can
 
02:08:27.589 --> 02:08:27.599 align:start position:0%
automatically be
 
02:08:29.830 --> 02:08:29.840 align:start position:0%
at capacity before you've even gotten to
 
02:08:31.910 --> 02:08:31.920 align:start position:0%
start your new budget process maybe it's
 
02:08:34.470 --> 02:08:34.480 align:start position:0%
for raises inflation whatever reason or
 
02:08:36.470 --> 02:08:36.480 align:start position:0%
projects because
 
02:08:38.470 --> 02:08:38.480 align:start position:0%
once you've adopted a note
 
02:08:40.709 --> 02:08:40.719 align:start position:0%
a bond or a multi-year contract that
 
02:08:42.790 --> 02:08:42.800 align:start position:0%
gets absorbed into your operating budget
 
02:08:45.189 --> 02:08:45.199 align:start position:0%
for subsequent years so depending on the
 
02:08:46.950 --> 02:08:46.960 align:start position:0%
dollar amount and the thresholds of an
 
02:08:50.390 --> 02:08:50.400 align:start position:0%
adopted tax cap we do find in other
 
02:08:52.550 --> 02:08:52.560 align:start position:0%
parts of the country
 
02:08:54.950 --> 02:08:54.960 align:start position:0%
challenges with the constraints that
 
02:08:57.189 --> 02:08:57.199 align:start position:0%
that brings upon
 
02:08:59.589 --> 02:08:59.599 align:start position:0%
the municipality or the local
 
02:09:01.990 --> 02:09:02.000 align:start position:0%
district we're not here to discuss the
 
02:09:05.189 --> 02:09:05.199 align:start position:0%
school side of it however
 
02:09:08.390 --> 02:09:08.400 align:start position:0%
as the bill reads i am concerned that
 
02:09:11.669 --> 02:09:11.679 align:start position:0%
the tax cap to be overridden at a
 
02:09:15.270 --> 02:09:15.280 align:start position:0%
deliberative session in an sb2 town
 
02:09:16.870 --> 02:09:16.880 align:start position:0%
the voters have the right to make
 
02:09:18.790 --> 02:09:18.800 align:start position:0%
adjustments at that deliberative session
 
02:09:20.390 --> 02:09:20.400 align:start position:0%
and that's the only time they can make
 
02:09:23.189 --> 02:09:23.199 align:start position:0%
that adjustment and then on the ballot
 
02:09:24.709 --> 02:09:24.719 align:start position:0%
when they go to vote
 
02:09:26.470 --> 02:09:26.480 align:start position:0%
a month later it would require that
 
02:09:28.470 --> 02:09:28.480 align:start position:0%
three-fifths majority to then pass
 
02:09:31.109 --> 02:09:31.119 align:start position:0%
whatever it is um that they were doing
 
02:09:31.119 --> 02:09:31.910 align:start position:0%
whatever it is um that they were doing
so

02:09:31.910 --> 02:09:31.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:09:34.149 --> 02:09:34.159 align:start position:0%
again i believe in practice the current
 
02:09:34.159 --> 02:09:35.030 align:start position:0%
again i believe in practice the current
law

02:09:35.030 --> 02:09:35.040 align:start position:0%
law
 
02:09:35.040 --> 02:09:35.830 align:start position:0%
law
does

02:09:35.830 --> 02:09:35.840 align:start position:0%
does
 
02:09:37.990 --> 02:09:38.000 align:start position:0%
limit the power of the governing body to
 
02:09:40.069 --> 02:09:40.079 align:start position:0%
bring forth a budget that that community
 
02:09:41.350 --> 02:09:41.360 align:start position:0%
doesn't feel
 
02:09:43.510 --> 02:09:43.520 align:start position:0%
is reasonable and that's why they've
 
02:09:45.669 --> 02:09:45.679 align:start position:0%
adopted a tax cap however the
 
02:09:47.830 --> 02:09:47.840 align:start position:0%
legislative body should have all the
 
02:09:50.310 --> 02:09:50.320 align:start position:0%
authority granted in the town meeting of
 
02:09:52.390 --> 02:09:52.400 align:start position:0%
doing its will
 
02:09:54.310 --> 02:09:54.320 align:start position:0%
and i'll take any questions thank you
 
02:09:55.350 --> 02:09:55.360 align:start position:0%
miss heck
 
02:09:57.910 --> 02:09:57.920 align:start position:0%
yes sir representative matt jory
 
02:09:59.669 --> 02:09:59.679 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you
 
02:10:01.109 --> 02:10:01.119 align:start position:0%
catherine for taking my question miss
 
02:10:03.750 --> 02:10:03.760 align:start position:0%
heck excuse me taking my question so
 
02:10:05.830 --> 02:10:05.840 align:start position:0%
if i understand my own thought process
 
02:10:08.149 --> 02:10:08.159 align:start position:0%
and if i understand you correctly
 
02:10:10.709 --> 02:10:10.719 align:start position:0%
is it true then that setting the default
 
02:10:12.229 --> 02:10:12.239 align:start position:0%
budget which will contain the
 
02:10:15.750 --> 02:10:15.760 align:start position:0%
obligations for long-term contractual
 
02:10:18.470 --> 02:10:18.480 align:start position:0%
agreements the bond
 
02:10:20.390 --> 02:10:20.400 align:start position:0%
collective bargaining agreements lease
 
02:10:20.400 --> 02:10:21.510 align:start position:0%
collective bargaining agreements lease
payments

02:10:21.510 --> 02:10:21.520 align:start position:0%
payments
 
02:10:25.270 --> 02:10:25.280 align:start position:0%
will create a could create an issue here
 
02:10:27.990 --> 02:10:28.000 align:start position:0%
for that default budget
 
02:10:30.069 --> 02:10:30.079 align:start position:0%
yes it is my opinion that as sometimes
 
02:10:31.990 --> 02:10:32.000 align:start position:0%
you will see a default budget can be
 
02:10:34.229 --> 02:10:34.239 align:start position:0%
greater than the proposed operating
 
02:10:35.910 --> 02:10:35.920 align:start position:0%
budget for the reasons that you stated
 
02:10:38.310 --> 02:10:38.320 align:start position:0%
because of legal obligations
 
02:10:41.270 --> 02:10:41.280 align:start position:0%
so that again could automatically
 
02:10:41.280 --> 02:10:42.709 align:start position:0%
so that again could automatically
override

02:10:42.709 --> 02:10:42.719 align:start position:0%
override
 
02:10:44.550 --> 02:10:44.560 align:start position:0%
the number and the tax cap based on
 
02:10:50.149 --> 02:10:50.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:52.390 --> 02:10:52.400 align:start position:0%
thank you mr two thank you
 
02:10:55.189 --> 02:10:55.199 align:start position:0%
miss hacks for taking my question i mean
 
02:10:56.709 --> 02:10:56.719 align:start position:0%
i'm going to ask you the same question
 
02:11:00.149 --> 02:11:00.159 align:start position:0%
in terms of only four towns have adopted
 
02:11:01.830 --> 02:11:01.840 align:start position:0%
tax caps
 
02:11:01.840 --> 02:11:03.030 align:start position:0%
tax caps
and

02:11:03.030 --> 02:11:03.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:11:04.950 --> 02:11:04.960 align:start position:0%
in your membership
 
02:11:07.589 --> 02:11:07.599 align:start position:0%
in your association membership how many
 
02:11:09.350 --> 02:11:09.360 align:start position:0%
towns do you have would you be able to
 
02:11:11.510 --> 02:11:11.520 align:start position:0%
answer that question
 
02:11:15.109 --> 02:11:15.119 align:start position:0%
won't this be like a very small
 
02:11:17.990 --> 02:11:18.000 align:start position:0%
percentage of the total number of towns
 
02:11:20.310 --> 02:11:20.320 align:start position:0%
in our state
 
02:11:22.550 --> 02:11:22.560 align:start position:0%
yes all the towns are currently members
 
02:11:24.870 --> 02:11:24.880 align:start position:0%
of our organization and
 
02:11:27.350 --> 02:11:27.360 align:start position:0%
it would only affect the four towns that
 
02:11:29.109 --> 02:11:29.119 align:start position:0%
have currently adopted it under the
 
02:11:32.709 --> 02:11:32.719 align:start position:0%
provisions that they adopted it under
 
02:11:35.430 --> 02:11:35.440 align:start position:0%
so it is only four communities at this
 
02:11:37.589 --> 02:11:37.599 align:start position:0%
time i'm not sure if there's any
 
02:11:39.189 --> 02:11:39.199 align:start position:0%
petition warrant articles or warrant
 
02:11:39.199 --> 02:11:40.310 align:start position:0%
petition warrant articles or warrant
articles

02:11:40.310 --> 02:11:40.320 align:start position:0%
articles
 
02:11:43.109 --> 02:11:43.119 align:start position:0%
this season regarding a tax cap
 
02:11:49.589 --> 02:11:49.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:51.830 --> 02:11:51.840 align:start position:0%
mr chef quick follow-up follow-up
 
02:11:53.510 --> 02:11:53.520 align:start position:0%
yesterday um
 
02:11:55.669 --> 02:11:55.679 align:start position:0%
can you give me the number of towns that
 
02:11:59.990 --> 02:12:00.000 align:start position:0%
you have as a membership 234 234 out of
 
02:12:00.000 --> 02:12:01.510 align:start position:0%
you have as a membership 234 234 out of
234

02:12:01.510 --> 02:12:01.520 align:start position:0%
234
 
02:12:03.350 --> 02:12:03.360 align:start position:0%
four have adopted
 
02:12:05.030 --> 02:12:05.040 align:start position:0%
that's correct so
 
02:12:08.390 --> 02:12:08.400 align:start position:0%
would you believe that this is
 
02:12:08.400 --> 02:12:10.629 align:start position:0%
would you believe that this is
like

02:12:10.629 --> 02:12:10.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:12.950 --> 02:12:12.960 align:start position:0%
too small a percentage
 
02:12:14.470 --> 02:12:14.480 align:start position:0%
to implement
 
02:12:17.109 --> 02:12:17.119 align:start position:0%
uh overall
 
02:12:17.119 --> 02:12:18.790 align:start position:0%
uh overall
um

02:12:18.790 --> 02:12:18.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:12:22.229 --> 02:12:22.239 align:start position:0%
tax cap spending cap whatever you call
 
02:12:22.239 --> 02:12:23.109 align:start position:0%
tax cap spending cap whatever you call
that

02:12:23.109 --> 02:12:23.119 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:12:23.119 --> 02:12:23.910 align:start position:0%
that
yes

02:12:23.910 --> 02:12:23.920 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:12:26.390 --> 02:12:26.400 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
02:12:28.629 --> 02:12:28.639 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
02:12:30.310 --> 02:12:30.320 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
02:12:32.870 --> 02:12:32.880 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh i'm gonna follow
 
02:12:35.430 --> 02:12:35.440 align:start position:0%
up on uh representative majorie's first
 
02:12:37.350 --> 02:12:37.360 align:start position:0%
question about the
 
02:12:40.069 --> 02:12:40.079 align:start position:0%
uh limit of the first year's payment on
 
02:12:42.709 --> 02:12:42.719 align:start position:0%
a bond is then limited throughout the
 
02:12:44.950 --> 02:12:44.960 align:start position:0%
next budget season will that have an
 
02:12:48.149 --> 02:12:48.159 align:start position:0%
effect on a municipality's bond rating
 
02:12:50.950 --> 02:12:50.960 align:start position:0%
if they know that uh the tax cap can't
 
02:12:52.790 --> 02:12:52.800 align:start position:0%
be overridden so we're limited in the
 
02:12:54.069 --> 02:12:54.079 align:start position:0%
amount of money
 
02:12:57.350 --> 02:12:57.360 align:start position:0%
uh or the tax cap may not be
 
02:12:59.589 --> 02:12:59.599 align:start position:0%
limited and therefore we may not be able
 
02:13:01.669 --> 02:13:01.679 align:start position:0%
to pay the amount of the bond that's due
 
02:13:03.510 --> 02:13:03.520 align:start position:0%
that year i i would have to check with
 
02:13:05.589 --> 02:13:05.599 align:start position:0%
moody's rating agency to see if that
 
02:13:07.910 --> 02:13:07.920 align:start position:0%
would affect their bond rating okay
 
02:13:09.589 --> 02:13:09.599 align:start position:0%
thank you you're welcome
 
02:13:11.830 --> 02:13:11.840 align:start position:0%
okay seeing no further questions from
 
02:13:14.550 --> 02:13:14.560 align:start position:0%
the committee uh thank you miss hack
 
02:13:17.270 --> 02:13:17.280 align:start position:0%
thank you very much okay uh we're at a
 
02:13:19.990 --> 02:13:20.000 align:start position:0%
point in the uh
 
02:13:21.750 --> 02:13:21.760 align:start position:0%
on our schedule where
 
02:13:23.669 --> 02:13:23.679 align:start position:0%
we're so far behind
 
02:13:25.189 --> 02:13:25.199 align:start position:0%
we are
 
02:13:25.199 --> 02:13:26.069 align:start position:0%
we are
past

02:13:26.069 --> 02:13:26.079 align:start position:0%
past
 
02:13:29.350 --> 02:13:29.360 align:start position:0%
the time that we've noticed for all the
 
02:13:31.350 --> 02:13:31.360 align:start position:0%
hearings we're going to have today so
 
02:13:32.709 --> 02:13:32.719 align:start position:0%
that gives me the
 
02:13:36.069 --> 02:13:36.079 align:start position:0%
the unusual freedom of of taking some of
 
02:13:37.350 --> 02:13:37.360 align:start position:0%
these next
 
02:13:39.510 --> 02:13:39.520 align:start position:0%
earrings out of water since uh
 
02:13:41.109 --> 02:13:41.119 align:start position:0%
everyone's been noticed and given a
 
02:13:42.790 --> 02:13:42.800 align:start position:0%
chance to be here
 
02:13:46.870 --> 02:13:46.880 align:start position:0%
so uh if you remember we had
 
02:13:50.870 --> 02:13:50.880 align:start position:0%
some bad weather last thursday that we
 
02:13:52.629 --> 02:13:52.639 align:start position:0%
we concluded our hearings a little bit
 
02:13:56.149 --> 02:13:56.159 align:start position:0%
early on house bill 1223 i recessed that
 
02:13:56.159 --> 02:13:57.109 align:start position:0%
early on house bill 1223 i recessed that
bill

i live in merrimack

i ask for this bill for several reasons
 
02:15:32.149 --> 02:15:32.159 align:start position:0%
as it stands right now
 
02:15:32.159 --> 02:15:33.270 align:start position:0%
as it stands right now
a

02:15:33.270 --> 02:15:33.280 align:start position:0%
a
 
02:15:36.390 --> 02:15:36.400 align:start position:0%
elected official member of the school
 
02:15:38.629 --> 02:15:38.639 align:start position:0%
board school budget committee
 
02:15:41.109 --> 02:15:41.119 align:start position:0%
can miss three out of every four
 
02:15:41.119 --> 02:15:42.229 align:start position:0%
can miss three out of every four
meetings

02:15:42.229 --> 02:15:42.239 align:start position:0%
meetings
 
02:15:45.109 --> 02:15:45.119 align:start position:0%
um excused of course by the by the uh
 
02:15:46.310 --> 02:15:46.320 align:start position:0%
the chair
 
02:15:48.149 --> 02:15:48.159 align:start position:0%
and then they can attend a meeting and
 
02:15:50.390 --> 02:15:50.400 align:start position:0%
then they can miss three more meetings
 
02:15:52.870 --> 02:15:52.880 align:start position:0%
if you take a a school budget committee
 
02:15:55.189 --> 02:15:55.199 align:start position:0%
for example that operates primarily in a
 
02:15:58.310 --> 02:15:58.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:00.229 --> 02:16:00.239 align:start position:0%
they can essentially miss 75 percent of
 
02:16:01.750 --> 02:16:01.760 align:start position:0%
the meetings and they're not really
 
02:16:01.760 --> 02:16:03.109 align:start position:0%
the meetings and they're not really
representing

02:16:03.109 --> 02:16:03.119 align:start position:0%
representing
 
02:16:06.069 --> 02:16:06.079 align:start position:0%
the the taxpayers the public the schools
 
02:16:09.830 --> 02:16:09.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:11.830 --> 02:16:11.840 align:start position:0%
secondary to that
 
02:16:13.240 --> 02:16:13.250 align:start position:0%
these meetings are occurring
 
02:16:13.250 --> 02:16:15.430 align:start position:0%
these meetings are occurring
[Music]

02:16:15.430 --> 02:16:15.440 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:16:17.830 --> 02:16:17.840 align:start position:0%
when some of the members are living out
 
02:16:19.109 --> 02:16:19.119 align:start position:0%
of town
 
02:16:21.910 --> 02:16:21.920 align:start position:0%
so snowbirds if you will
 
02:16:23.510 --> 02:16:23.520 align:start position:0%
the bulk of the meetings are occurring
 
02:16:25.589 --> 02:16:25.599 align:start position:0%
again over the winter time
 
02:16:26.790 --> 02:16:26.800 align:start position:0%
a member
 
02:16:26.800 --> 02:16:27.750 align:start position:0%
a member
can

02:16:27.750 --> 02:16:27.760 align:start position:0%
can
 
02:16:29.510 --> 02:16:29.520 align:start position:0%
attend remotely
 
02:16:32.389 --> 02:16:32.399 align:start position:0%
but that presents multiple problems
 
02:16:34.629 --> 02:16:34.639 align:start position:0%
technology has failed on multiple
 
02:16:37.990 --> 02:16:38.000 align:start position:0%
occasions it takes time to connect
 
02:16:40.790 --> 02:16:40.800 align:start position:0%
and often times meetings are delayed as
 
02:16:42.950 --> 02:16:42.960 align:start position:0%
a result of of that
 
02:16:42.960 --> 02:16:43.830 align:start position:0%
a result of of that
people

02:16:43.830 --> 02:16:43.840 align:start position:0%
people
 
02:16:46.950 --> 02:16:46.960 align:start position:0%
can't hear on both sides of the
 
02:16:48.790 --> 02:16:48.800 align:start position:0%
of the connection some for the the
 
02:16:52.389 --> 02:16:52.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:55.030 --> 02:16:55.040 align:start position:0%
and it also requires a roll call vote on
 
02:16:57.750 --> 02:16:57.760 align:start position:0%
each and every item
 
02:16:59.589 --> 02:16:59.599 align:start position:0%
for those reasons
 
02:17:01.990 --> 02:17:02.000 align:start position:0%
i'm asking that
 
02:17:04.629 --> 02:17:04.639 align:start position:0%
in-person attendance be required and
 
02:17:04.639 --> 02:17:07.110 align:start position:0%
in-person attendance be required and
that

02:17:07.110 --> 02:17:07.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:09.910 --> 02:17:09.920 align:start position:0%
the member must attend
 
02:17:11.589 --> 02:17:11.599 align:start position:0%
all of the meetings with the exception
 
02:17:11.599 --> 02:17:13.349 align:start position:0%
all of the meetings with the exception
of

02:17:13.349 --> 02:17:13.359 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:17:16.870 --> 02:17:16.880 align:start position:0%
two meetings per year or or 25
 
02:17:18.389 --> 02:17:18.399 align:start position:0%
of such meetings annually so this
 
02:17:20.950 --> 02:17:20.960 align:start position:0%
actually needs to be amended to
 
02:17:24.070 --> 02:17:24.080 align:start position:0%
um state that they need to attend 75
 
02:17:26.309 --> 02:17:26.319 align:start position:0%
percent of the meetings
 
02:17:29.429 --> 02:17:29.439 align:start position:0%
or they can miss two whichever is um
 
02:17:31.830 --> 02:17:31.840 align:start position:0%
whichever is less
 
02:17:31.840 --> 02:17:35.589 align:start position:0%
whichever is less
so

02:17:35.589 --> 02:17:35.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:37.270 --> 02:17:37.280 align:start position:0%
i'll take any questions that you might
 
02:17:46.870 --> 02:17:46.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:48.230 --> 02:17:48.240 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
02:17:49.830 --> 02:17:49.840 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
02:17:51.349 --> 02:17:51.359 align:start position:0%
um if i
 
02:17:54.830 --> 02:17:54.840 align:start position:0%
was elected to a school board and
 
02:17:57.110 --> 02:17:57.120 align:start position:0%
subsequently found that i have a
 
02:18:00.230 --> 02:18:00.240 align:start position:0%
condition like i do which is epilepsy
 
02:18:03.509 --> 02:18:03.519 align:start position:0%
well controlled but i have breakthroughs
 
02:18:07.190 --> 02:18:07.200 align:start position:0%
and if i under unscheduled so if i have
 
02:18:10.870 --> 02:18:10.880 align:start position:0%
more than two episodes of of
 
02:18:13.589 --> 02:18:13.599 align:start position:0%
seizures that i cannot control i cannot
 
02:18:15.910 --> 02:18:15.920 align:start position:0%
control when they are
 
02:18:18.870 --> 02:18:18.880 align:start position:0%
missing two meetings may happen
 
02:18:20.309 --> 02:18:20.319 align:start position:0%
because of that
 
02:18:22.629 --> 02:18:22.639 align:start position:0%
and so am i being discriminated against
 
02:18:25.270 --> 02:18:25.280 align:start position:0%
because i have an illness that i cannot
 
02:18:25.280 --> 02:18:28.150 align:start position:0%
because i have an illness that i cannot
control

02:18:28.150 --> 02:18:28.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:30.070 --> 02:18:30.080 align:start position:0%
that is an excellent question and thank
 
02:18:31.589 --> 02:18:31.599 align:start position:0%
you for that
 
02:18:34.070 --> 02:18:34.080 align:start position:0%
the provision for extenuating
 
02:18:36.870 --> 02:18:36.880 align:start position:0%
circumstances would be in there so in
 
02:18:38.790 --> 02:18:38.800 align:start position:0%
that particular case that should be an
 
02:18:41.030 --> 02:18:41.040 align:start position:0%
excused absence what this is really
 
02:18:43.270 --> 02:18:43.280 align:start position:0%
targeting is those that may take a
 
02:18:45.669 --> 02:18:45.679 align:start position:0%
position within the the community and
 
02:18:47.669 --> 02:18:47.679 align:start position:0%
then they never show up to the meetings
 
02:18:50.230 --> 02:18:50.240 align:start position:0%
that's a disadvantage to everybody that
 
02:18:52.709 --> 02:18:52.719 align:start position:0%
they represent
 
02:18:54.230 --> 02:18:54.240 align:start position:0%
are there other questions here
 
02:18:54.240 --> 02:18:56.389 align:start position:0%
are there other questions here
representative

02:18:56.389 --> 02:18:56.399 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:18:58.790 --> 02:18:58.800 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and um
 
02:19:00.709 --> 02:19:00.719 align:start position:0%
i know i have a head in my way so i'm
 
02:19:04.070 --> 02:19:04.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:05.190 --> 02:19:05.200 align:start position:0%
yes yours
 
02:19:06.469 --> 02:19:06.479 align:start position:0%
could you please remove your head
 
02:19:08.469 --> 02:19:08.479 align:start position:0%
representative tripp yes
 
02:19:10.070 --> 02:19:10.080 align:start position:0%
um thank you so much for taking my
 
02:19:11.990 --> 02:19:12.000 align:start position:0%
question and and it follows on uh
 
02:19:13.509 --> 02:19:13.519 align:start position:0%
representative gilman
 
02:19:15.830 --> 02:19:15.840 align:start position:0%
perhaps i i just missed it i i missed
 
02:19:17.669 --> 02:19:17.679 align:start position:0%
the language of um
 
02:19:20.790 --> 02:19:20.800 align:start position:0%
allowing for an excused absence and and
 
02:19:22.950 --> 02:19:22.960 align:start position:0%
i'll give you an example if i if i may
 
02:19:22.960 --> 02:19:23.750 align:start position:0%
i'll give you an example if i if i may
um

02:19:23.750 --> 02:19:23.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:19:25.509 --> 02:19:25.519 align:start position:0%
i'm on the board of aldermen in in
 
02:19:26.950 --> 02:19:26.960 align:start position:0%
national new hampshire
 
02:19:30.389 --> 02:19:30.399 align:start position:0%
we do not allow more than two unexcused
 
02:19:33.270 --> 02:19:33.280 align:start position:0%
absences or even excuse absences within
 
02:19:34.709 --> 02:19:34.719 align:start position:0%
a quarter
 
02:19:36.309 --> 02:19:36.319 align:start position:0%
if we do the
 
02:19:37.589 --> 02:19:37.599 align:start position:0%
the board has to vote as to whether or
 
02:19:39.509 --> 02:19:39.519 align:start position:0%
not you get your stipend you would not
 
02:19:42.549 --> 02:19:42.559 align:start position:0%
be removed but something such as that so
 
02:19:45.030 --> 02:19:45.040 align:start position:0%
are you saying that if in the case of
 
02:19:47.509 --> 02:19:47.519 align:start position:0%
representative gilman where she'd had an
 
02:19:47.519 --> 02:19:49.110 align:start position:0%
representative gilman where she'd had an
illness

02:19:49.110 --> 02:19:49.120 align:start position:0%
illness
 
02:19:51.429 --> 02:19:51.439 align:start position:0%
and they excused her because of the
 
02:19:54.230 --> 02:19:54.240 align:start position:0%
illness this would not apply to her
 
02:19:56.870 --> 02:19:56.880 align:start position:0%
that is correct she would be excused and
 
02:19:59.190 --> 02:19:59.200 align:start position:0%
therefore not this law would not be
 
02:20:00.870 --> 02:20:00.880 align:start position:0%
applicable because it's an extenuating
 
02:20:00.880 --> 02:20:03.030 align:start position:0%
applicable because it's an extenuating
circumstance

02:20:03.030 --> 02:20:03.040 align:start position:0%
circumstance
 
02:20:04.950 --> 02:20:04.960 align:start position:0%
may i just follow up real quickly does
 
02:20:07.910 --> 02:20:07.920 align:start position:0%
does that body vote on whether or not
 
02:20:09.830 --> 02:20:09.840 align:start position:0%
it's an extenuating circumstance or is
 
02:20:12.870 --> 02:20:12.880 align:start position:0%
it by the the chair that decides that i
 
02:20:15.030 --> 02:20:15.040 align:start position:0%
believe the chair should hold that uh
 
02:20:16.950 --> 02:20:16.960 align:start position:0%
position to be able to do that and just
 
02:20:18.630 --> 02:20:18.640 align:start position:0%
a quick clarification follow up and
 
02:20:20.790 --> 02:20:20.800 align:start position:0%
maybe this is for representative notter
 
02:20:23.349 --> 02:20:23.359 align:start position:0%
is that in in the um
 
02:20:25.190 --> 02:20:25.200 align:start position:0%
in the documentation in the in this
 
02:20:28.550 --> 02:20:28.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:28.560 --> 02:20:29.670 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:20:29.670 --> 02:20:29.680 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:20:31.510 --> 02:20:31.520 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
02:20:33.110 --> 02:20:33.120 align:start position:0%
please can you restate your question for
 
02:20:34.230 --> 02:20:34.240 align:start position:0%
me uh
 
02:20:35.990 --> 02:20:36.000 align:start position:0%
what you you had said yes that you felt
 
02:20:37.670 --> 02:20:37.680 align:start position:0%
that you said you felt it should be the
 
02:20:39.670 --> 02:20:39.680 align:start position:0%
chair that would make that decision and
 
02:20:41.990 --> 02:20:42.000 align:start position:0%
i'm asking is that clear in this
 
02:20:46.230 --> 02:20:46.240 align:start position:0%
particular law in the um
 
02:20:47.590 --> 02:20:47.600 align:start position:0%
i believe that's an amendment that would
 
02:20:50.550 --> 02:20:50.560 align:start position:0%
be required okay thank you so much
 
02:20:53.349 --> 02:20:53.359 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
02:20:55.030 --> 02:20:55.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
02:20:56.550 --> 02:20:56.560 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
02:20:59.349 --> 02:20:59.359 align:start position:0%
so currently under
 
02:21:03.910 --> 02:21:03.920 align:start position:0%
rsa 32 colon 15 section 6
 
02:21:05.990 --> 02:21:06.000 align:start position:0%
pertaining to budget committees it
 
02:21:07.910 --> 02:21:07.920 align:start position:0%
states that a member
 
02:21:10.950 --> 02:21:10.960 align:start position:0%
shall cease to hold office immediately
 
02:21:14.230 --> 02:21:14.240 align:start position:0%
upon missing four consecutive scheduled
 
02:21:17.030 --> 02:21:17.040 align:start position:0%
meetings without excuse
 
02:21:18.150 --> 02:21:18.160 align:start position:0%
do you
 
02:21:20.870 --> 02:21:20.880 align:start position:0%
do you see or feel that this
 
02:21:22.870 --> 02:21:22.880 align:start position:0%
bill may be in conflict with that
 
02:21:25.429 --> 02:21:25.439 align:start position:0%
section of statute
 
02:21:27.670 --> 02:21:27.680 align:start position:0%
i believe that that is uh the what needs
 
02:21:30.550 --> 02:21:30.560 align:start position:0%
to be amended and and states that that
 
02:21:34.150 --> 02:21:34.160 align:start position:0%
the problem that that is as is in 3215
 
02:21:36.870 --> 02:21:36.880 align:start position:0%
is the word consecutive
 
02:21:40.550 --> 02:21:40.560 align:start position:0%
so if again you can miss three and then
 
02:21:42.150 --> 02:21:42.160 align:start position:0%
show up to one and miss three and show
 
02:21:43.270 --> 02:21:43.280 align:start position:0%
up to one
 
02:21:47.670 --> 02:21:47.680 align:start position:0%
so again it may need to have some legal
 
02:21:49.910 --> 02:21:49.920 align:start position:0%
amendment on this i don't know
 
02:21:49.920 --> 02:21:50.870 align:start position:0%
amendment on this i don't know
but

02:21:50.870 --> 02:21:50.880 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:21:56.630 --> 02:21:56.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:59.590 --> 02:21:59.600 align:start position:0%
representatives davis
 
02:22:01.590 --> 02:22:01.600 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you sir for
 
02:22:03.190 --> 02:22:03.200 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
02:22:08.230 --> 02:22:08.240 align:start position:0%
are you aware of how many incidences of
 
02:22:10.389 --> 02:22:10.399 align:start position:0%
showing up in a meeting and then missing
 
02:22:12.230 --> 02:22:12.240 align:start position:0%
three consecutive meetings and showing
 
02:22:14.469 --> 02:22:14.479 align:start position:0%
up at a meeting have happened in the
 
02:22:14.479 --> 02:22:15.429 align:start position:0%
up at a meeting have happened in the
last

02:22:15.429 --> 02:22:15.439 align:start position:0%
last
 
02:22:18.230 --> 02:22:18.240 align:start position:0%
period of time
 
02:22:21.190 --> 02:22:21.200 align:start position:0%
sufficient to spur the development of
 
02:22:23.750 --> 02:22:23.760 align:start position:0%
this piece of legislation is are we
 
02:22:26.150 --> 02:22:26.160 align:start position:0%
talking huge numbers of people and
 
02:22:27.750 --> 02:22:27.760 align:start position:0%
school boards across the state who do
 
02:22:30.389 --> 02:22:30.399 align:start position:0%
this on a routine basis or how many
 
02:22:33.910 --> 02:22:33.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:35.429 --> 02:22:35.439 align:start position:0%
very good question and thank you for
 
02:22:38.950 --> 02:22:38.960 align:start position:0%
that i can't state across the state what
 
02:22:40.870 --> 02:22:40.880 align:start position:0%
the number of instances i can only go by
 
02:22:43.670 --> 02:22:43.680 align:start position:0%
personal experience and i can say that i
 
02:22:47.510 --> 02:22:47.520 align:start position:0%
i have seen it occur within my own town
 
02:22:50.309 --> 02:22:50.319 align:start position:0%
where there are members that continually
 
02:22:53.510 --> 02:22:53.520 align:start position:0%
get either excused absences
 
02:22:57.590 --> 02:22:57.600 align:start position:0%
or they will show up for just every so
 
02:23:00.389 --> 02:23:00.399 align:start position:0%
often just to keep their seat and again
 
02:23:02.469 --> 02:23:02.479 align:start position:0%
really that's it's not fair to the to
 
02:23:04.630 --> 02:23:04.640 align:start position:0%
the taxpayers
 
02:23:07.030 --> 02:23:07.040 align:start position:0%
follow up mr chair yes go ahead
 
02:23:09.510 --> 02:23:09.520 align:start position:0%
so typically in our committee we we tend
 
02:23:09.520 --> 02:23:10.469 align:start position:0%
so typically in our committee we we tend
to

02:23:10.469 --> 02:23:10.479 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:23:13.030 --> 02:23:13.040 align:start position:0%
see a lot of enabling legislation
 
02:23:16.469 --> 02:23:16.479 align:start position:0%
rather than statewide mandates and given
 
02:23:19.030 --> 02:23:19.040 align:start position:0%
your testimony that this is something
 
02:23:20.710 --> 02:23:20.720 align:start position:0%
you've seen happen in your town but
 
02:23:22.550 --> 02:23:22.560 align:start position:0%
you're not aware of other instances in
 
02:23:25.270 --> 02:23:25.280 align:start position:0%
the state do you think that applying a
 
02:23:28.070 --> 02:23:28.080 align:start position:0%
statewide mandate for a problem that
 
02:23:31.349 --> 02:23:31.359 align:start position:0%
exists by your own testimony in your
 
02:23:33.910 --> 02:23:33.920 align:start position:0%
town is appropriate
 
02:23:36.070 --> 02:23:36.080 align:start position:0%
i absolutely do just because i don't
 
02:23:37.510 --> 02:23:37.520 align:start position:0%
know if it's occurred elsewhere i'm
 
02:23:39.510 --> 02:23:39.520 align:start position:0%
pretty confident it does although there
 
02:23:42.389 --> 02:23:42.399 align:start position:0%
is no absolute fact of that the reality
 
02:23:44.870 --> 02:23:44.880 align:start position:0%
is is that all of these school board
 
02:23:46.790 --> 02:23:46.800 align:start position:0%
school budget committees etc all operate
 
02:23:49.190 --> 02:23:49.200 align:start position:0%
under 3215 they're all governed by the
 
02:23:54.070 --> 02:23:54.080 align:start position:0%
exact same rsa which says they can miss
 
02:23:56.309 --> 02:23:56.319 align:start position:0%
four consecutive meetings
 
02:23:57.429 --> 02:23:57.439 align:start position:0%
and then
 
02:23:59.190 --> 02:23:59.200 align:start position:0%
three meetings and then they can attend
 
02:24:00.790 --> 02:24:00.800 align:start position:0%
another one
 
02:24:02.710 --> 02:24:02.720 align:start position:0%
and still keep their seat
 
02:24:04.230 --> 02:24:04.240 align:start position:0%
again if you only have eight meetings a
 
02:24:04.240 --> 02:24:05.590 align:start position:0%
again if you only have eight meetings a
year

02:24:05.590 --> 02:24:05.600 align:start position:0%
year
 
02:24:07.670 --> 02:24:07.680 align:start position:0%
think about that eight meetings a year
 
02:24:09.830 --> 02:24:09.840 align:start position:0%
for a school budget committee
 
02:24:11.349 --> 02:24:11.359 align:start position:0%
and you can miss
 
02:24:17.349 --> 02:24:17.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:18.870 --> 02:24:18.880 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
02:24:20.389 --> 02:24:20.399 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
02:24:20.399 --> 02:24:21.750 align:start position:0%
taking my question
um

02:24:21.750 --> 02:24:21.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:24:24.710 --> 02:24:24.720 align:start position:0%
i i think i'm piling on i just can't i i
 
02:24:26.469 --> 02:24:26.479 align:start position:0%
just can't reconcile it in my head so
 
02:24:28.910 --> 02:24:28.920 align:start position:0%
forgive me for this but
 
02:24:32.150 --> 02:24:32.160 align:start position:0%
9283 says that
 
02:24:33.990 --> 02:24:34.000 align:start position:0%
it says that
 
02:24:37.110 --> 02:24:37.120 align:start position:0%
if you cannot attend by
 
02:24:39.349 --> 02:24:39.359 align:start position:0%
in person
 
02:24:42.469 --> 02:24:42.479 align:start position:0%
if it's not reasonably practical
 
02:24:44.790 --> 02:24:44.800 align:start position:0%
but then this is a limiting clause on
 
02:24:47.830 --> 02:24:47.840 align:start position:0%
that which which says that end
 
02:24:49.750 --> 02:24:49.760 align:start position:0%
i'm just actually my question is is this
 
02:24:52.630 --> 02:24:52.640 align:start position:0%
then a qualifying clause which says
 
02:24:53.990 --> 02:24:54.000 align:start position:0%
i'm saying it's not reason to be
 
02:24:54.000 --> 02:24:55.270 align:start position:0%
i'm saying it's not reason to be
practical

02:24:55.270 --> 02:24:55.280 align:start position:0%
practical
 
02:24:57.990 --> 02:24:58.000 align:start position:0%
and the budget committee has to agree
 
02:24:59.990 --> 02:25:00.000 align:start position:0%
with that
 
02:25:01.429 --> 02:25:01.439 align:start position:0%
is that what this does because i'm
 
02:25:04.790 --> 02:25:04.800 align:start position:0%
trying to reconcile where 9283
 
02:25:06.150 --> 02:25:06.160 align:start position:0%
and now
 
02:25:10.950 --> 02:25:10.960 align:start position:0%
32 5 are going to work together
 
02:25:13.190 --> 02:25:13.200 align:start position:0%
i i guess i'm not following your your
 
02:25:16.389 --> 02:25:16.399 align:start position:0%
exact question there i'm not either okay
 
02:25:16.399 --> 02:25:18.150 align:start position:0%
exact question there i'm not either okay
great

02:25:18.150 --> 02:25:18.160 align:start position:0%
great
 
02:25:18.160 --> 02:25:18.950 align:start position:0%
great
so

02:25:18.950 --> 02:25:18.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:25:20.710 --> 02:25:20.720 align:start position:0%
mr chair may i try to restate that yes
 
02:25:24.550 --> 02:25:24.560 align:start position:0%
go ahead thank you so in 1923 it says
 
02:25:25.830 --> 02:25:25.840 align:start position:0%
that remember the public may participate
 
02:25:27.429 --> 02:25:27.439 align:start position:0%
in meeting other by attendance a person
 
02:25:30.790 --> 02:25:30.800 align:start position:0%
uh only when such attendance is not
 
02:25:33.190 --> 02:25:33.200 align:start position:0%
reasonably practical and that's stated
 
02:25:34.309 --> 02:25:34.319 align:start position:0%
in here
 
02:25:36.630 --> 02:25:36.640 align:start position:0%
but it says then only
 
02:25:38.309 --> 02:25:38.319 align:start position:0%
if the budget committee finds
 
02:25:40.950 --> 02:25:40.960 align:start position:0%
extenuating circumstances so i am
 
02:25:43.190 --> 02:25:43.200 align:start position:0%
declaring as as one of the
 
02:25:44.550 --> 02:25:44.560 align:start position:0%
representatives say
 
02:25:46.950 --> 02:25:46.960 align:start position:0%
here says that i have a reason that is
 
02:25:49.190 --> 02:25:49.200 align:start position:0%
that i have a stated reason which means
 
02:25:50.550 --> 02:25:50.560 align:start position:0%
i can't be there
 
02:25:52.389 --> 02:25:52.399 align:start position:0%
does this also say that you have to
 
02:25:53.910 --> 02:25:53.920 align:start position:0%
agree with that
 
02:25:53.920 --> 02:25:54.790 align:start position:0%
agree with that
man

02:25:54.790 --> 02:25:54.800 align:start position:0%
man
 
02:25:56.870 --> 02:25:56.880 align:start position:0%
and therefore the last piece of that
 
02:26:00.150 --> 02:26:00.160 align:start position:0%
does this create some conflict with 90
 
02:26:01.990 --> 02:26:02.000 align:start position:0%
with 91a that's what i just want to make
 
02:26:04.550 --> 02:26:04.560 align:start position:0%
sure i understand so is it is it 91a or
 
02:26:07.349 --> 02:26:07.359 align:start position:0%
92a well 91 is what i should have said
 
02:26:09.990 --> 02:26:10.000 align:start position:0%
and if i said 92 ipods okay so can you
 
02:26:12.150 --> 02:26:12.160 align:start position:0%
read the first line of 91a again where
 
02:26:14.230 --> 02:26:14.240 align:start position:0%
it said if a member
 
02:26:14.240 --> 02:26:16.389 align:start position:0%
it said if a member
91a

02:26:16.389 --> 02:26:16.399 align:start position:0%
91a
 
02:26:17.349 --> 02:26:17.359 align:start position:0%
hold on
 
02:26:22.230 --> 02:26:22.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:24.309 --> 02:26:24.319 align:start position:0%
parent a
 
02:26:26.790 --> 02:26:26.800 align:start position:0%
a member of the public body which is a
 
02:26:27.990 --> 02:26:28.000 align:start position:0%
member of the public body may
 
02:26:29.750 --> 02:26:29.760 align:start position:0%
participate in a meeting other than by
 
02:26:31.510 --> 02:26:31.520 align:start position:0%
attendance in person
 
02:26:34.630 --> 02:26:34.640 align:start position:0%
at the location of the meeting only when
 
02:26:36.550 --> 02:26:36.560 align:start position:0%
such attendance is not reasonably
 
02:26:36.560 --> 02:26:37.830 align:start position:0%
such attendance is not reasonably
practical

02:26:37.830 --> 02:26:37.840 align:start position:0%
practical
 
02:26:39.830 --> 02:26:39.840 align:start position:0%
it continues on for a sentence that says
 
02:26:42.230 --> 02:26:42.240 align:start position:0%
any reason that such attendance is not
 
02:26:42.240 --> 02:26:43.270 align:start position:0%
any reason that such attendance is not
reasonably

02:26:43.270 --> 02:26:43.280 align:start position:0%
reasonably
 
02:26:43.280 --> 02:26:44.389 align:start position:0%
reasonably
practical

02:26:44.389 --> 02:26:44.399 align:start position:0%
practical
 
02:26:45.990 --> 02:26:46.000 align:start position:0%
shall be stated in the minutes of the
 
02:26:46.000 --> 02:26:47.349 align:start position:0%
shall be stated in the minutes of the
meeting

02:26:47.349 --> 02:26:47.359 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
02:26:47.359 --> 02:26:49.110 align:start position:0%
meeting
period

02:26:49.110 --> 02:26:49.120 align:start position:0%
period
 
02:26:51.030 --> 02:26:51.040 align:start position:0%
perfect thank you for clarifying that i
 
02:26:52.389 --> 02:26:52.399 align:start position:0%
know that was going back and forth it's
 
02:26:52.399 --> 02:26:53.190 align:start position:0%
know that was going back and forth it's
okay

02:26:53.190 --> 02:26:53.200 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:26:53.200 --> 02:26:53.910 align:start position:0%
okay
so

02:26:53.910 --> 02:26:53.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:26:53.920 --> 02:26:54.870 align:start position:0%
so
um

02:26:54.870 --> 02:26:54.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:26:58.070 --> 02:26:58.080 align:start position:0%
reasonably practical if a member
 
02:27:01.670 --> 02:27:01.680 align:start position:0%
of the board lives out of town
 
02:27:04.790 --> 02:27:04.800 align:start position:0%
to me that's an option for the member of
 
02:27:07.590 --> 02:27:07.600 align:start position:0%
that board to do that but they shouldn't
 
02:27:09.270 --> 02:27:09.280 align:start position:0%
hold office when the majority of the
 
02:27:11.030 --> 02:27:11.040 align:start position:0%
meetings are going on
 
02:27:11.040 --> 02:27:11.830 align:start position:0%
meetings are going on
so

02:27:11.830 --> 02:27:11.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:27:13.510 --> 02:27:13.520 align:start position:0%
as an example
 
02:27:15.910 --> 02:27:15.920 align:start position:0%
if there's eight meetings a year of
 
02:27:18.309 --> 02:27:18.319 align:start position:0%
which six of them are held during the
 
02:27:20.469 --> 02:27:20.479 align:start position:0%
winter period
 
02:27:20.479 --> 02:27:21.349 align:start position:0%
winter period
then

02:27:21.349 --> 02:27:21.359 align:start position:0%
then
 
02:27:24.389 --> 02:27:24.399 align:start position:0%
that person should be expected to be in
 
02:27:24.399 --> 02:27:25.910 align:start position:0%
that person should be expected to be in
person

02:27:25.910 --> 02:27:25.920 align:start position:0%
person
 
02:27:28.630 --> 02:27:28.640 align:start position:0%
live in in right there with everybody
 
02:27:28.640 --> 02:27:29.429 align:start position:0%
live in in right there with everybody
else

02:27:29.429 --> 02:27:29.439 align:start position:0%
else
 
02:27:31.429 --> 02:27:31.439 align:start position:0%
because if they're not
 
02:27:33.110 --> 02:27:33.120 align:start position:0%
ultimately what's going to happen is
 
02:27:35.190 --> 02:27:35.200 align:start position:0%
you're going to have technology problems
 
02:27:37.590 --> 02:27:37.600 align:start position:0%
you're going to have hearing problems
 
02:27:39.750 --> 02:27:39.760 align:start position:0%
there's just it's it's it's a challenge
 
02:27:39.760 --> 02:27:41.590 align:start position:0%
there's just it's it's it's a challenge
now

02:27:41.590 --> 02:27:41.600 align:start position:0%
now
 
02:27:41.600 --> 02:27:43.030 align:start position:0%
now
reasonably

02:27:43.030 --> 02:27:43.040 align:start position:0%
reasonably
 
02:27:47.030 --> 02:27:47.040 align:start position:0%
practical if a member is ill and cannot
 
02:27:49.190 --> 02:27:49.200 align:start position:0%
attend then they should be allowed to
 
02:27:51.990 --> 02:27:52.000 align:start position:0%
attend via remote if it's a one-off
 
02:27:54.469 --> 02:27:54.479 align:start position:0%
situation not an every single meeting
 
02:27:54.479 --> 02:27:56.389 align:start position:0%
situation not an every single meeting
occurrence

02:27:56.389 --> 02:27:56.399 align:start position:0%
occurrence
 
02:27:58.389 --> 02:27:58.399 align:start position:0%
i hope that answers your question thank
 
02:28:01.510 --> 02:28:01.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:03.750 --> 02:28:03.760 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman and thank you for
 
02:28:05.429 --> 02:28:05.439 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
02:28:05.439 --> 02:28:06.550 align:start position:0%
taking my question
um

02:28:06.550 --> 02:28:06.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:28:08.630 --> 02:28:08.640 align:start position:0%
i don't this is this is so funny because
 
02:28:10.550 --> 02:28:10.560 align:start position:0%
usually i don't ask my questions in this
 
02:28:14.710 --> 02:28:14.720 align:start position:0%
direction but can you change your bylaws
 
02:28:17.670 --> 02:28:17.680 align:start position:0%
of whatever the board is that is having
 
02:28:18.870 --> 02:28:18.880 align:start position:0%
this issue
 
02:28:22.389 --> 02:28:22.399 align:start position:0%
such that it says you have to attend you
 
02:28:23.910 --> 02:28:23.920 align:start position:0%
know all the one of the meetings or
 
02:28:26.870 --> 02:28:26.880 align:start position:0%
whatever your group of people says
 
02:28:29.830 --> 02:28:29.840 align:start position:0%
rather than seeking a statewide
 
02:28:29.840 --> 02:28:31.510 align:start position:0%
rather than seeking a statewide
repair

02:28:31.510 --> 02:28:31.520 align:start position:0%
repair
 
02:28:34.950 --> 02:28:34.960 align:start position:0%
excellent question thank you so
 
02:28:38.630 --> 02:28:38.640 align:start position:0%
in in merrimack we do not have bylaws
 
02:28:40.550 --> 02:28:40.560 align:start position:0%
for school budget committee
 
02:28:43.349 --> 02:28:43.359 align:start position:0%
so they only govern they only operate
 
02:28:46.309 --> 02:28:46.319 align:start position:0%
under 3215 and any other rsa that
 
02:28:49.670 --> 02:28:49.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:49.680 --> 02:28:50.100 align:start position:0%
 
yes

02:28:50.100 --> 02:28:50.110 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:28:50.110 --> 02:28:51.670 align:start position:0%
yes
[Music]

02:28:51.670 --> 02:28:51.680 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:28:53.750 --> 02:28:53.760 align:start position:0%
so is there anything prohibiting them
 
02:28:55.990 --> 02:28:56.000 align:start position:0%
from adopting bylaws
 
02:28:57.670 --> 02:28:57.680 align:start position:0%
can't answer that question
 
02:29:02.070 --> 02:29:02.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:02.080 --> 02:29:03.830 align:start position:0%
 
representative

02:29:03.830 --> 02:29:03.840 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:29:05.990 --> 02:29:06.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr thank you for taking my
 
02:29:09.030 --> 02:29:09.040 align:start position:0%
question um part of the question i got
 
02:29:12.230 --> 02:29:12.240 align:start position:0%
the answer from representative wien's
 
02:29:14.870 --> 02:29:14.880 align:start position:0%
questioning my second part was
 
02:29:18.150 --> 02:29:18.160 align:start position:0%
you know if we have learned anything
 
02:29:21.510 --> 02:29:21.520 align:start position:0%
from the pandemic that we are
 
02:29:26.710 --> 02:29:26.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:28.790 --> 02:29:28.800 align:start position:0%
and you know
 
02:29:31.830 --> 02:29:31.840 align:start position:0%
this was the only way the
 
02:29:35.510 --> 02:29:35.520 align:start position:0%
electronic or hybrid was the only way
 
02:29:39.030 --> 02:29:39.040 align:start position:0%
that i could participate
 
02:29:40.710 --> 02:29:40.720 align:start position:0%
last year
 
02:29:40.720 --> 02:29:41.910 align:start position:0%
last year
in

02:29:41.910 --> 02:29:41.920 align:start position:0%
in
 
02:29:45.270 --> 02:29:45.280 align:start position:0%
the elected position that i have
 
02:29:45.280 --> 02:29:46.389 align:start position:0%
the elected position that i have
and

02:29:46.389 --> 02:29:46.399 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:29:46.399 --> 02:29:47.110 align:start position:0%
and
so

02:29:47.110 --> 02:29:47.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:29:47.990 --> 02:29:48.000 align:start position:0%
you know
 
02:29:49.910 --> 02:29:49.920 align:start position:0%
being new hampshire it's live free or
 
02:29:52.710 --> 02:29:52.720 align:start position:0%
die everything is a voluntary thing are
 
02:29:53.910 --> 02:29:53.920 align:start position:0%
we going to
 
02:29:56.630 --> 02:29:56.640 align:start position:0%
shut people off because
 
02:29:59.429 --> 02:29:59.439 align:start position:0%
they are unable to fulfill
 
02:30:01.190 --> 02:30:01.200 align:start position:0%
the service
 
02:30:03.590 --> 02:30:03.600 align:start position:0%
because of the illness because of any
 
02:30:03.600 --> 02:30:04.870 align:start position:0%
because of the illness because of any
extraneous

02:30:04.870 --> 02:30:04.880 align:start position:0%
extraneous
 
02:30:07.030 --> 02:30:07.040 align:start position:0%
and you know you cannot participate in
 
02:30:10.309 --> 02:30:10.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:12.950 --> 02:30:12.960 align:start position:0%
so uh have you considered that angle
 
02:30:15.990 --> 02:30:16.000 align:start position:0%
absolutely and thank you for that so um
 
02:30:18.230 --> 02:30:18.240 align:start position:0%
if the meeting is offered in what i
 
02:30:21.429 --> 02:30:21.439 align:start position:0%
would call a hybrid model uh virtual and
 
02:30:23.349 --> 02:30:23.359 align:start position:0%
in person by all means
 
02:30:25.429 --> 02:30:25.439 align:start position:0%
then then this is not applicable because
 
02:30:28.230 --> 02:30:28.240 align:start position:0%
it's being offered that way however if
 
02:30:30.150 --> 02:30:30.160 align:start position:0%
you are again
 
02:30:32.070 --> 02:30:32.080 align:start position:0%
missing meetings on a regular basis or
 
02:30:33.190 --> 02:30:33.200 align:start position:0%
if you're
 
02:30:35.110 --> 02:30:35.120 align:start position:0%
living out of town
 
02:30:37.990 --> 02:30:38.000 align:start position:0%
during the bulk of of what's occurring
 
02:30:40.469 --> 02:30:40.479 align:start position:0%
then that's a choice it's a choice to go
 
02:30:43.590 --> 02:30:43.600 align:start position:0%
ahead and not be present but to to phone
 
02:30:44.950 --> 02:30:44.960 align:start position:0%
in you're not seeing powerpoint
 
02:30:47.270 --> 02:30:47.280 align:start position:0%
presentations you're not you're you're
 
02:30:49.910 --> 02:30:49.920 align:start position:0%
not able to
 
02:30:52.550 --> 02:30:52.560 align:start position:0%
directly engage with somebody face to
 
02:30:54.630 --> 02:30:54.640 align:start position:0%
face in the meetings because you choose
 
02:30:56.630 --> 02:30:56.640 align:start position:0%
to live out of town for an elected
 
02:30:56.640 --> 02:31:00.070 align:start position:0%
to live out of town for an elected
position

02:31:00.070 --> 02:31:00.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:02.150 --> 02:31:02.160 align:start position:0%
uh thank you um
 
02:31:04.550 --> 02:31:04.560 align:start position:0%
i'm not just talking about the phone
 
02:31:08.870 --> 02:31:08.880 align:start position:0%
what the pandemic has status is a
 
02:31:11.990 --> 02:31:12.000 align:start position:0%
video that we very successfully
 
02:31:15.190 --> 02:31:15.200 align:start position:0%
participated and even this committee met
 
02:31:17.670 --> 02:31:17.680 align:start position:0%
virtually in a hybrid
 
02:31:21.349 --> 02:31:21.359 align:start position:0%
and i was able to participate exclu
 
02:31:23.670 --> 02:31:23.680 align:start position:0%
because of my health condition i
 
02:31:25.030 --> 02:31:25.040 align:start position:0%
couldn't be here
 
02:31:28.389 --> 02:31:28.399 align:start position:0%
so it would if this was in place
 
02:31:30.070 --> 02:31:30.080 align:start position:0%
it would have precluded me from
 
02:31:33.190 --> 02:31:33.200 align:start position:0%
participating and fulfilling my duty as
 
02:31:35.429 --> 02:31:35.439 align:start position:0%
an elected sure and i would not oppose
 
02:31:37.190 --> 02:31:37.200 align:start position:0%
an amendment to show that if the meeting
 
02:31:39.190 --> 02:31:39.200 align:start position:0%
is being offered in a hybrid manner by
 
02:31:41.190 --> 02:31:41.200 align:start position:0%
all means i mean there may be times that
 
02:31:43.429 --> 02:31:43.439 align:start position:0%
it's just more convenient to do so but
 
02:31:45.830 --> 02:31:45.840 align:start position:0%
at least everybody's engaged all
 
02:31:45.840 --> 02:31:46.950 align:start position:0%
at least everybody's engaged all
together

02:31:46.950 --> 02:31:46.960 align:start position:0%
together
 
02:31:48.950 --> 02:31:48.960 align:start position:0%
versus one person living in another
 
02:31:48.960 --> 02:31:49.830 align:start position:0%
versus one person living in another
state

02:31:49.830 --> 02:31:49.840 align:start position:0%
state
 
02:31:52.950 --> 02:31:52.960 align:start position:0%
trying to fulfill their duties here
 
02:31:54.950 --> 02:31:54.960 align:start position:0%
representative guthrie
 
02:31:57.190 --> 02:31:57.200 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
02:32:00.630 --> 02:32:00.640 align:start position:0%
bringing this problem forward and i i
 
02:32:03.910 --> 02:32:03.920 align:start position:0%
know that it hell enhance it does
 
02:32:05.670 --> 02:32:05.680 align:start position:0%
happen and i don't know if you have a
 
02:32:08.309 --> 02:32:08.319 align:start position:0%
particular situation with this out of
 
02:32:08.319 --> 02:32:09.270 align:start position:0%
particular situation with this out of
town

02:32:09.270 --> 02:32:09.280 align:start position:0%
town
 
02:32:12.469 --> 02:32:12.479 align:start position:0%
official but as a practical matter my
 
02:32:15.990 --> 02:32:16.000 align:start position:0%
experience is that most committees
 
02:32:17.990 --> 02:32:18.000 align:start position:0%
whether it be budget committee or school
 
02:32:20.870 --> 02:32:20.880 align:start position:0%
committee or selectmen if they have a
 
02:32:24.870 --> 02:32:24.880 align:start position:0%
member that's abusing their membership
 
02:32:27.510 --> 02:32:27.520 align:start position:0%
the other members of that that committee
 
02:32:30.550 --> 02:32:30.560 align:start position:0%
asked that person to resign
 
02:32:33.910 --> 02:32:33.920 align:start position:0%
and it's a request it seems that this
 
02:32:37.830 --> 02:32:37.840 align:start position:0%
puts some muscle into that where the
 
02:32:40.950 --> 02:32:40.960 align:start position:0%
school committee does not or the uh the
 
02:32:42.710 --> 02:32:42.720 align:start position:0%
budget committee does not have to
 
02:32:45.349 --> 02:32:45.359 align:start position:0%
request they can demand that the person
 
02:32:47.510 --> 02:32:47.520 align:start position:0%
leave is to add your understanding of
 
02:32:49.990 --> 02:32:50.000 align:start position:0%
the intent of this bill
 
02:32:52.309 --> 02:32:52.319 align:start position:0%
could i ask you to see if you could
 
02:32:55.349 --> 02:32:55.359 align:start position:0%
format that type of question is that is
 
02:32:56.870 --> 02:32:56.880 align:start position:0%
the intent of the
 
02:32:59.990 --> 02:33:00.000 align:start position:0%
uh the bill to put some strength in the
 
02:33:02.230 --> 02:33:02.240 align:start position:0%
ability of the other members of the
 
02:33:03.670 --> 02:33:03.680 align:start position:0%
budget committee and the school
 
02:33:06.870 --> 02:33:06.880 align:start position:0%
committee to ask the person to leave not

to resign but they can just they can
 
02:33:12.070 --> 02:33:12.080 align:start position:0%
tell them to leave yes so that it would
 
02:33:14.309 --> 02:33:14.319 align:start position:0%
provide a mechanism of removal as
 
02:33:16.950 --> 02:33:16.960 align:start position:0%
necessary yes thank you
 
02:33:20.790 --> 02:33:20.800 align:start position:0%

thank you for taking my question
 
02:33:25.910 --> 02:33:25.920 align:start position:0%
would you believe
 
02:33:27.110 --> 02:33:27.120 align:start position:0%

02:33:30.800 --> 02:33:32.710 align:start position:0%
that
i

02:33:32.710 --> 02:33:32.720 align:start position:0%
i
 
02:33:34.389 --> 02:33:34.399 align:start position:0%
don't believe there's any
 
02:33:36.710 --> 02:33:36.720 align:start position:0%
vehicle currently
 
02:33:39.030 --> 02:33:39.040 align:start position:0%
in the uh state law that allows you to
 
02:33:42.309 --> 02:33:42.319 align:start position:0%
remove a person an elected official so
 
02:33:44.150 --> 02:33:44.160 align:start position:0%
this is a
 
02:33:47.270 --> 02:33:47.280 align:start position:0%
a new instance of law correct there are
 
02:33:49.670 --> 02:33:49.680 align:start position:0%
no mechanisms within rsa that allows you
 
02:33:53.590 --> 02:33:53.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:55.990 --> 02:33:56.000 align:start position:0%

adler and representative nodder for
 
02:34:03.910 --> 02:34:03.920 align:start position:0%
accepting my question
 
02:34:06.710 --> 02:34:06.720 align:start position:0%
um you testified earlier that this bill
 
02:34:09.349 --> 02:34:09.359 align:start position:0%
came about because of a member of the
 
02:34:11.030 --> 02:34:11.040 align:start position:0%
merrimack school district budget
 
02:34:11.040 --> 02:34:12.309 align:start position:0%
merrimack school district budget
committee

02:34:12.309 --> 02:34:12.319 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:34:14.150 --> 02:34:14.160 align:start position:0%
being away for the winter is that
 
02:34:14.160 --> 02:34:15.190 align:start position:0%
being away for the winter is that
correct

02:34:15.190 --> 02:34:15.200 align:start position:0%
correct
 
02:34:17.030 --> 02:34:17.040 align:start position:0%
that is one of the reasons for the bill
 
02:34:20.230 --> 02:34:20.240 align:start position:0%
yes okay and follow yes thank you and uh
 
02:34:22.309 --> 02:34:22.319 align:start position:0%
you also brought up the
 
02:34:23.750 --> 02:34:23.760 align:start position:0%
the whole concept that it was this
 
02:34:25.670 --> 02:34:25.680 align:start position:0%
person's choice
 
02:34:28.070 --> 02:34:28.080 align:start position:0%
i'm assuming that the voters made the
 
02:34:30.389 --> 02:34:30.399 align:start position:0%
choice to elect this person
 
02:34:32.630 --> 02:34:32.640 align:start position:0%
is that true and if so how many terms
 
02:34:34.630 --> 02:34:34.640 align:start position:0%
how many times has this person been
 
02:34:36.790 --> 02:34:36.800 align:start position:0%
elected to the school district budget
 
02:34:38.870 --> 02:34:38.880 align:start position:0%
committee i can't answer how many times
 
02:34:40.309 --> 02:34:40.319 align:start position:0%
they've been elected but yes she was
 
02:34:40.319 --> 02:34:41.670 align:start position:0%
they've been elected but yes she was
elected

02:34:41.670 --> 02:34:41.680 align:start position:0%
elected
 
02:34:42.830 --> 02:34:42.840 align:start position:0%
okay thank
 
02:34:47.830 --> 02:34:47.840 align:start position:0%
you yes uh representative tripp
 
02:34:50.150 --> 02:34:50.160 align:start position:0%
you all set out
 
02:34:53.990 --> 02:34:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:56.230 --> 02:34:56.240 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
02:34:56.240 --> 02:34:58.630 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
um

02:34:58.630 --> 02:34:58.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:35:00.630 --> 02:35:00.640 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to ask this without being
 
02:35:00.640 --> 02:35:01.590 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to ask this without being
flip

02:35:01.590 --> 02:35:01.600 align:start position:0%
flip
 
02:35:03.910 --> 02:35:03.920 align:start position:0%
but i may not succeed
 
02:35:05.750 --> 02:35:05.760 align:start position:0%
so please bear with me
 
02:35:08.230 --> 02:35:08.240 align:start position:0%
do you think there's a reason why
 
02:35:09.990 --> 02:35:10.000 align:start position:0%
there is no
 
02:35:12.870 --> 02:35:12.880 align:start position:0%
uh procedure outlined in the state's
 
02:35:15.590 --> 02:35:15.600 align:start position:0%
laws for remote removing and a duly
 
02:35:17.990 --> 02:35:18.000 align:start position:0%
elected official that there's a reason
 
02:35:19.349 --> 02:35:19.359 align:start position:0%
for that
 
02:35:21.110 --> 02:35:21.120 align:start position:0%
that perhaps
 
02:35:23.750 --> 02:35:23.760 align:start position:0%
the proper people to remove an elected
 
02:35:25.990 --> 02:35:26.000 align:start position:0%
official are the people who elected that
 
02:35:28.950 --> 02:35:28.960 align:start position:0%
official in the first place
 
02:35:30.469 --> 02:35:30.479 align:start position:0%
let me let me follow that with a
 
02:35:32.870 --> 02:35:32.880 align:start position:0%
different kind of question
 
02:35:32.880 --> 02:35:34.790 align:start position:0%
different kind of question
how

02:35:34.790 --> 02:35:34.800 align:start position:0%
how
 
02:35:36.790 --> 02:35:36.800 align:start position:0%
how do those people that elected that
 
02:35:39.990 --> 02:35:40.000 align:start position:0%
person remove that person
 
02:35:41.830 --> 02:35:41.840 align:start position:0%
i respond mr chair
 
02:35:44.150 --> 02:35:44.160 align:start position:0%
by not re-electing them
 
02:35:44.160 --> 02:35:45.030 align:start position:0%
by not re-electing them
so

02:35:45.030 --> 02:35:45.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:35:46.950 --> 02:35:46.960 align:start position:0%
a person who's elected for a term of
 
02:35:50.309 --> 02:35:50.319 align:start position:0%
three years can abuse the system
 
02:35:51.590 --> 02:35:51.600 align:start position:0%
show up for
 
02:35:53.670 --> 02:35:53.680 align:start position:0%
one meeting every so often just to keep
 
02:35:55.990 --> 02:35:56.000 align:start position:0%
their seat and there's no way to prevent
 
02:35:57.590 --> 02:35:57.600 align:start position:0%
that from occurring
 
02:35:57.600 --> 02:35:58.790 align:start position:0%
that from occurring
until

02:35:58.790 --> 02:35:58.800 align:start position:0%
until
 
02:36:00.710 --> 02:36:00.720 align:start position:0%
that three-year term when they can be
 
02:36:03.349 --> 02:36:03.359 align:start position:0%
voted out that's correct yeah
 
02:36:05.990 --> 02:36:06.000 align:start position:0%
i i personally think that that's a flaw
 
02:36:10.309 --> 02:36:10.319 align:start position:0%
in the system but i'm not a legislator
 
02:36:13.270 --> 02:36:13.280 align:start position:0%
yes sir representative gallagher
 
02:36:13.280 --> 02:36:15.349 align:start position:0%
yes sir representative gallagher
so

02:36:15.349 --> 02:36:15.359 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:36:15.359 --> 02:36:17.349 align:start position:0%
so
um

02:36:17.349 --> 02:36:17.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:36:20.469 --> 02:36:20.479 align:start position:0%
oh so the legislation says
 
02:36:22.790 --> 02:36:22.800 align:start position:0%
it would create a vacancy in the
 
02:36:25.190 --> 02:36:25.200 align:start position:0%
election elected position
 
02:36:27.750 --> 02:36:27.760 align:start position:0%
um so when is filled again
 
02:36:31.429 --> 02:36:31.439 align:start position:0%
um would the person who
 
02:36:34.309 --> 02:36:34.319 align:start position:0%
was removed under this law
 
02:36:37.830 --> 02:36:37.840 align:start position:0%
would they then be ineligible for
 
02:36:40.230 --> 02:36:40.240 align:start position:0%
running for the new election to fill the
 
02:36:43.910 --> 02:36:43.920 align:start position:0%
seat or could they just run for it again
 
02:36:45.349 --> 02:36:45.359 align:start position:0%
i would see no reason why they couldn't
 
02:36:47.910 --> 02:36:47.920 align:start position:0%
run for it again it's not so then what's
 
02:36:51.510 --> 02:36:51.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:53.030 --> 02:36:53.040 align:start position:0%
so then
 
02:36:56.309 --> 02:36:56.319 align:start position:0%
what's the point like if
 
02:36:58.230 --> 02:36:58.240 align:start position:0%
if they can just run again and just get
 
02:37:00.469 --> 02:37:00.479 align:start position:0%
reelected again then basically haven't
 
02:37:01.990 --> 02:37:02.000 align:start position:0%
you just
 
02:37:05.030 --> 02:37:05.040 align:start position:0%
basically made the town hold a pointless
 
02:37:06.950 --> 02:37:06.960 align:start position:0%
election that just cost them money and
 
02:37:09.110 --> 02:37:09.120 align:start position:0%
doesn't actually determine anything
 
02:37:10.550 --> 02:37:10.560 align:start position:0%
well i wouldn't call it a pointless
 
02:37:11.750 --> 02:37:11.760 align:start position:0%
election when they have elections
 
02:37:13.750 --> 02:37:13.760 align:start position:0%
annually to begin with
 
02:37:16.550 --> 02:37:16.560 align:start position:0%
secondly uh it would bring awareness to
 
02:37:18.469 --> 02:37:18.479 align:start position:0%
the situation because others would be
 
02:37:19.830 --> 02:37:19.840 align:start position:0%
aware of it
 
02:37:21.750 --> 02:37:21.760 align:start position:0%
third and final it would allow somebody
 
02:37:23.670 --> 02:37:23.680 align:start position:0%
to be in the position that could
 
02:37:26.630 --> 02:37:26.640 align:start position:0%
contribute and represent taxpayers
 
02:37:26.640 --> 02:37:27.990 align:start position:0%
contribute and represent taxpayers
students

02:37:27.990 --> 02:37:28.000 align:start position:0%
students
 
02:37:29.830 --> 02:37:29.840 align:start position:0%
personnel etc
 
02:37:33.030 --> 02:37:33.040 align:start position:0%
during that period of time
 
02:37:37.190 --> 02:37:37.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:37.200 --> 02:37:38.230 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:37:38.230 --> 02:37:38.240 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:37:39.590 --> 02:37:39.600 align:start position:0%
seeing no further questions from the
 
02:37:39.600 --> 02:37:41.830 align:start position:0%
seeing no further questions from the
committee

02:37:41.830 --> 02:37:41.840 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:37:47.190 --> 02:37:47.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:48.950 --> 02:37:48.960 align:start position:0%
oh i'm sorry uh
 
02:37:51.670 --> 02:37:51.680 align:start position:0%
we have representative graves from uh
 
02:37:54.230 --> 02:37:54.240 align:start position:0%
not representative but we have mr graves
 
02:38:08.710 --> 02:38:08.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:10.389 --> 02:38:10.399 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and h grace the new
 
02:38:12.469 --> 02:38:12.479 align:start position:0%
hampshire municipal association i hope
 
02:38:15.030 --> 02:38:15.040 align:start position:0%
that i put a pink card in
 
02:38:18.309 --> 02:38:18.319 align:start position:0%
we uh we oppose we oppose this bill um
 
02:38:20.309 --> 02:38:20.319 align:start position:0%
obviously i only speak to the municipal
 
02:38:21.910 --> 02:38:21.920 align:start position:0%
side of things
 
02:38:24.150 --> 02:38:24.160 align:start position:0%
uh which would be uh lines three through
 
02:38:26.230 --> 02:38:26.240 align:start position:0%
nine we don't repres i don't represent
 
02:38:28.309 --> 02:38:28.319 align:start position:0%
the school boards
 
02:38:30.070 --> 02:38:30.080 align:start position:0%
there are a couple items that i would
 
02:38:31.830 --> 02:38:31.840 align:start position:0%
like to point out
 
02:38:34.150 --> 02:38:34.160 align:start position:0%
first i agree with representative power
 
02:38:36.710 --> 02:38:36.720 align:start position:0%
that lines six through nine which is
 
02:38:39.270 --> 02:38:39.280 align:start position:0%
the second section of that new paragraph
 
02:38:40.710 --> 02:38:40.720 align:start position:0%
that we added to the budget committee
 
02:38:40.720 --> 02:38:41.670 align:start position:0%
that we added to the budget committee
statute

02:38:41.670 --> 02:38:41.680 align:start position:0%
statute
 
02:38:46.150 --> 02:38:46.160 align:start position:0%
does conflict with rsa 32 colon 15 roman
 
02:38:46.160 --> 02:38:47.349 align:start position:0%
does conflict with rsa 32 colon 15 roman
6.

02:38:47.349 --> 02:38:47.359 align:start position:0%
6.
 
02:38:49.030 --> 02:38:49.040 align:start position:0%
it would be unclear
 
02:38:51.190 --> 02:38:51.200 align:start position:0%
which one of those would control
 
02:38:54.550 --> 02:38:54.560 align:start position:0%
that currently provides that
 
02:38:56.710 --> 02:38:56.720 align:start position:0%
that a member who
 
02:38:58.710 --> 02:38:58.720 align:start position:0%
would cease to hold office immediately
 
02:39:00.630 --> 02:39:00.640 align:start position:0%
upon missing four consecutive scheduled
 
02:39:02.790 --> 02:39:02.800 align:start position:0%
or announced meetings
 
02:39:04.309 --> 02:39:04.319 align:start position:0%
which uh
 
02:39:06.309 --> 02:39:06.319 align:start position:0%
he or she had received reasonable notice
 
02:39:09.190 --> 02:39:09.200 align:start position:0%
of and had not been excused by the chair
 
02:39:10.790 --> 02:39:10.800 align:start position:0%
there was some mention from the previous
 
02:39:12.630 --> 02:39:12.640 align:start position:0%
speaker about
 
02:39:14.950 --> 02:39:14.960 align:start position:0%
a person serving who wasn't domiciled in
 
02:39:16.870 --> 02:39:16.880 align:start position:0%
the town i just want to make sure the
 
02:39:19.830 --> 02:39:19.840 align:start position:0%
committee is aware that rsa 32 colon 15
 
02:39:21.670 --> 02:39:21.680 align:start position:0%
roman 5 exists
 
02:39:24.389 --> 02:39:24.399 align:start position:0%
and that requires that every member of
 
02:39:24.399 --> 02:39:25.590 align:start position:0%
and that requires that every member of
the

02:39:25.590 --> 02:39:25.600 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:39:27.670 --> 02:39:27.680 align:start position:0%
budget committee be a member of where
 
02:39:30.070 --> 02:39:30.080 align:start position:0%
that budget committee serves
 
02:39:31.670 --> 02:39:31.680 align:start position:0%
so i'm unclear exactly what happened
 
02:39:34.309 --> 02:39:34.319 align:start position:0%
there but if they're not living in that
 
02:39:36.309 --> 02:39:36.319 align:start position:0%
district they would immediately cease to
 
02:39:37.910 --> 02:39:37.920 align:start position:0%
be a member of the budget committee
 
02:39:39.750 --> 02:39:39.760 align:start position:0%
excuse me when you say the budget
 
02:39:42.790 --> 02:39:42.800 align:start position:0%
committee members have to be a member of
 
02:39:45.429 --> 02:39:45.439 align:start position:0%
where that committee serves i mean they
 
02:39:47.190 --> 02:39:47.200 align:start position:0%
have to be a resident of the community
 
02:39:47.200 --> 02:39:48.630 align:start position:0%
have to be a resident of the community
correct

02:39:48.630 --> 02:39:48.640 align:start position:0%
correct
 
02:39:50.550 --> 02:39:50.560 align:start position:0%
it specifically says domiciled in the
 
02:39:53.750 --> 02:39:53.760 align:start position:0%
town or district
 
02:39:55.190 --> 02:39:55.200 align:start position:0%
and that they would cease to hold office
 
02:39:56.790 --> 02:39:56.800 align:start position:0%
immediately upon
 
02:40:00.469 --> 02:40:00.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:00.479 --> 02:40:01.830 align:start position:0%
 
and

02:40:01.830 --> 02:40:01.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:40:04.630 --> 02:40:04.640 align:start position:0%
i i would also
 
02:40:06.550 --> 02:40:06.560 align:start position:0%
point out that this does add some
 
02:40:08.309 --> 02:40:08.319 align:start position:0%
confusion with regard to how it would
 
02:40:09.910 --> 02:40:09.920 align:start position:0%
operate with regard to the right to no
 
02:40:13.190 --> 02:40:13.200 align:start position:0%
law rsa 9182 roman 3
 
02:40:15.269 --> 02:40:15.279 align:start position:0%
because under that presumably what
 
02:40:16.790 --> 02:40:16.800 align:start position:0%
boards do is they adopt rules of
 
02:40:19.110 --> 02:40:19.120 align:start position:0%
procedure that determine whether or not
 
02:40:20.469 --> 02:40:20.479 align:start position:0%
a member can
 
02:40:22.230 --> 02:40:22.240 align:start position:0%
call in or otherwise participate
 
02:40:22.240 --> 02:40:23.830 align:start position:0%
call in or otherwise participate
remotely

02:40:23.830 --> 02:40:23.840 align:start position:0%
remotely
 
02:40:25.830 --> 02:40:25.840 align:start position:0%
and this would seem to add an additional
 
02:40:27.269 --> 02:40:27.279 align:start position:0%
requirement specific to budget
 
02:40:27.279 --> 02:40:28.389 align:start position:0%
requirement specific to budget
committees

02:40:28.389 --> 02:40:28.399 align:start position:0%
committees
 
02:40:28.399 --> 02:40:29.429 align:start position:0%
committees
that

02:40:29.429 --> 02:40:29.439 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:40:31.990 --> 02:40:32.000 align:start position:0%
that determination is
 
02:40:34.070 --> 02:40:34.080 align:start position:0%
not just made by the member calling in
 
02:40:34.080 --> 02:40:35.110 align:start position:0%
not just made by the member calling in
after

02:40:35.110 --> 02:40:35.120 align:start position:0%
after
 
02:40:36.870 --> 02:40:36.880 align:start position:0%
the board adopts such a rule of
 
02:40:36.880 --> 02:40:38.309 align:start position:0%
the board adopts such a rule of
procedure

02:40:38.309 --> 02:40:38.319 align:start position:0%
procedure
 
02:40:39.510 --> 02:40:39.520 align:start position:0%
but that
 
02:40:43.030 --> 02:40:43.040 align:start position:0%
the whole board would apparently have to
 
02:40:44.630 --> 02:40:44.640 align:start position:0%
then vote to determine whether
 
02:40:46.870 --> 02:40:46.880 align:start position:0%
extenuating circumstances exist in this
 
02:40:49.830 --> 02:40:49.840 align:start position:0%
particular circumstance so
 
02:40:52.790 --> 02:40:52.800 align:start position:0%
to representative gilman's point if she
 
02:40:54.630 --> 02:40:54.640 align:start position:0%
were trying to participate in a remote
 
02:40:56.710 --> 02:40:56.720 align:start position:0%
uh remotely presumably the whole board
 
02:40:57.990 --> 02:40:58.000 align:start position:0%
would have to vote
 
02:41:00.469 --> 02:41:00.479 align:start position:0%
and presumably you know her medical
 
02:41:01.910 --> 02:41:01.920 align:start position:0%
condition would be something they would
 
02:41:03.830 --> 02:41:03.840 align:start position:0%
debate in public which
 
02:41:06.389 --> 02:41:06.399 align:start position:0%
we generally discourage
 
02:41:07.750 --> 02:41:07.760 align:start position:0%
i'm happy to answer any questions the
 
02:41:09.590 --> 02:41:09.600 align:start position:0%
committee questions yes representative
 
02:41:09.600 --> 02:41:10.870 align:start position:0%
committee questions yes representative
guthrie

02:41:10.870 --> 02:41:10.880 align:start position:0%
guthrie
 
02:41:12.309 --> 02:41:12.319 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i have a quick
 
02:41:15.030 --> 02:41:15.040 align:start position:0%
question i think it's my understanding
 
02:41:17.990 --> 02:41:18.000 align:start position:0%
that what's going on now regardless of
 
02:41:20.309 --> 02:41:20.319 align:start position:0%
what the rsa says
 
02:41:21.590 --> 02:41:21.600 align:start position:0%
is that most
 
02:41:23.990 --> 02:41:24.000 align:start position:0%
committees have a policy
 
02:41:24.000 --> 02:41:25.030 align:start position:0%
committees have a policy
that

02:41:25.030 --> 02:41:25.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:41:27.429 --> 02:41:27.439 align:start position:0%
if a person doesn't attend
 
02:41:30.630 --> 02:41:30.640 align:start position:0%
a sufficient number of meetings
 
02:41:31.990 --> 02:41:32.000 align:start position:0%
uh for
 
02:41:34.389 --> 02:41:34.399 align:start position:0%
no reason that they are requested to
 
02:41:34.399 --> 02:41:35.510 align:start position:0%
no reason that they are requested to
resign

02:41:35.510 --> 02:41:35.520 align:start position:0%
resign
 
02:41:38.309 --> 02:41:38.319 align:start position:0%
isn't that the system that's being used
 
02:41:41.590 --> 02:41:41.600 align:start position:0%
throughout the state in fact
 
02:41:43.590 --> 02:41:43.600 align:start position:0%
i believe that a number of committees do
 
02:41:45.269 --> 02:41:45.279 align:start position:0%
have a policy that they would after a
 
02:41:46.790 --> 02:41:46.800 align:start position:0%
certain number of absences request the
 
02:41:48.950 --> 02:41:48.960 align:start position:0%
member resign of course they're only
 
02:41:50.469 --> 02:41:50.479 align:start position:0%
allowed to do what the legislature
 
02:41:52.309 --> 02:41:52.319 align:start position:0%
allows so they wouldn't be able to force
 
02:41:54.630 --> 02:41:54.640 align:start position:0%
that except in the case of
 
02:41:56.309 --> 02:41:56.319 align:start position:0%
someone missing four consecutive
 
02:41:56.319 --> 02:41:57.670 align:start position:0%
someone missing four consecutive
meetings

02:41:57.670 --> 02:41:57.680 align:start position:0%
meetings
 
02:42:01.030 --> 02:42:01.040 align:start position:0%
follow up mr chairman just quickly uh
 
02:42:02.230 --> 02:42:02.240 align:start position:0%
can you
 
02:42:05.110 --> 02:42:05.120 align:start position:0%
is it fair to say that the control
 
02:42:08.710 --> 02:42:08.720 align:start position:0%
of a person being asked or a person
 
02:42:11.590 --> 02:42:11.600 align:start position:0%
leaving is in the hands of the other
 
02:42:13.110 --> 02:42:13.120 align:start position:0%
members of the
 
02:42:16.550 --> 02:42:16.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:18.230 --> 02:42:18.240 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure i understand it's still in
 
02:42:20.309 --> 02:42:20.319 align:start position:0%
the hands of the committee they
 
02:42:22.389 --> 02:42:22.399 align:start position:0%
determine whether the
 
02:42:24.630 --> 02:42:24.640 align:start position:0%
absence is legitimate
 
02:42:26.309 --> 02:42:26.319 align:start position:0%
whether or not there are none other
 
02:42:29.429 --> 02:42:29.439 align:start position:0%
enough of them and then the the
 
02:42:31.750 --> 02:42:31.760 align:start position:0%
committee does in fact is the one that
 
02:42:33.910 --> 02:42:33.920 align:start position:0%
asks the person to resign
 
02:42:35.910 --> 02:42:35.920 align:start position:0%
yes i assume that the committee would
 
02:42:37.670 --> 02:42:37.680 align:start position:0%
look at the number of absences determine
 
02:42:39.349 --> 02:42:39.359 align:start position:0%
whether they seem appropriate and then
 
02:42:41.030 --> 02:42:41.040 align:start position:0%
determine whether they should request
 
02:42:42.870 --> 02:42:42.880 align:start position:0%
that person to resign or not all right
 
02:42:45.670 --> 02:42:45.680 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you mr chairman
 
02:42:47.429 --> 02:42:47.439 align:start position:0%
on this bill we had
 
02:42:49.830 --> 02:42:49.840 align:start position:0%
by the way we had two people
 
02:42:52.230 --> 02:42:52.240 align:start position:0%
logged in to support it and two
 
02:42:54.870 --> 02:42:54.880 align:start position:0%
logged in to oppose it
 
02:42:57.110 --> 02:42:57.120 align:start position:0%
for a total of four yes representative
 
02:42:57.120 --> 02:42:58.150 align:start position:0%
for a total of four yes representative
uh

02:42:58.150 --> 02:42:58.160 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:43:00.309 --> 02:43:00.319 align:start position:0%
gilman uh yeah that number has changed
 
02:43:02.230 --> 02:43:02.240 align:start position:0%
since we started the hearing oh we did
 
02:43:06.469 --> 02:43:06.479 align:start position:0%
it yeah uh it is uh support five of uh
 
02:43:11.670 --> 02:43:11.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:13.670 --> 02:43:13.680 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
02:43:13.680 --> 02:43:14.550 align:start position:0%
yes representative
um

02:43:14.550 --> 02:43:14.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:43:17.830 --> 02:43:17.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you uh mr griez
 
02:43:19.670 --> 02:43:19.680 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
02:43:20.830 --> 02:43:20.840 align:start position:0%
would this
 
02:43:20.840 --> 02:43:22.630 align:start position:0%
would this
um

02:43:22.630 --> 02:43:22.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:43:25.510 --> 02:43:25.520 align:start position:0%
issue of trying to
 
02:43:29.030 --> 02:43:29.040 align:start position:0%
bring the elected duly elected
 
02:43:31.349 --> 02:43:31.359 align:start position:0%
public official to
 
02:43:31.359 --> 02:43:33.190 align:start position:0%
public official to
participate

02:43:33.190 --> 02:43:33.200 align:start position:0%
participate
 
02:43:34.950 --> 02:43:34.960 align:start position:0%
would would that
 
02:43:37.190 --> 02:43:37.200 align:start position:0%
change with just the bylaw for the local
 
02:43:40.150 --> 02:43:40.160 align:start position:0%
level so the local control if the voters
 
02:43:43.110 --> 02:43:43.120 align:start position:0%
local voters elected
 
02:43:45.030 --> 02:43:45.040 align:start position:0%
and put them in the office
 
02:43:47.349 --> 02:43:47.359 align:start position:0%
and the board is
 
02:43:50.230 --> 02:43:50.240 align:start position:0%
if they have a bylaw to request or make
 
02:43:51.429 --> 02:43:51.439 align:start position:0%
that person
 
02:43:53.990 --> 02:43:54.000 align:start position:0%
participate more consistently would that
 
02:43:55.670 --> 02:43:55.680 align:start position:0%
solve the problem
 
02:43:57.510 --> 02:43:57.520 align:start position:0%
i think that would that would address
 
02:43:59.750 --> 02:43:59.760 align:start position:0%
the issue as representative guthrie had
 
02:44:01.349 --> 02:44:01.359 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier
 
02:44:03.590 --> 02:44:03.600 align:start position:0%
certainly boards are free to adopt
 
02:44:04.550 --> 02:44:04.560 align:start position:0%
you know
 
02:44:06.630 --> 02:44:06.640 align:start position:0%
a process whereby they'd say you know if
 
02:44:09.190 --> 02:44:09.200 align:start position:0%
you miss two or three meetings you
 
02:44:10.710 --> 02:44:10.720 align:start position:0%
haven't told the chair what's going on
 
02:44:12.790 --> 02:44:12.800 align:start position:0%
we're going to request that you resign
 
02:44:15.190 --> 02:44:15.200 align:start position:0%
and then obviously state law kicks in
 
02:44:17.510 --> 02:44:17.520 align:start position:0%
after missing four meetings so i think
 
02:44:19.110 --> 02:44:19.120 align:start position:0%
it's something that could be addressed
 
02:44:21.190 --> 02:44:21.200 align:start position:0%
at the board level
 
02:44:23.030 --> 02:44:23.040 align:start position:0%
follow-up quicker
 
02:44:25.590 --> 02:44:25.600 align:start position:0%
yeah so this
 
02:44:29.830 --> 02:44:29.840 align:start position:0%
is that one of the reasons that uh nhma
 
02:44:33.030 --> 02:44:33.040 align:start position:0%
opposes because it's a statewide mandate
 
02:44:35.349 --> 02:44:35.359 align:start position:0%
versus giving the local control
 
02:44:35.359 --> 02:44:38.230 align:start position:0%
versus giving the local control
yes

02:44:38.230 --> 02:44:38.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:38.240 --> 02:44:39.910 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:44:39.910 --> 02:44:39.920 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:44:41.590 --> 02:44:41.600 align:start position:0%
seeing no further questions thank you

merrimack new hampshire
 
02:45:43.830 --> 02:45:43.840 align:start position:0%
i asked for this bill
 
02:45:45.910 --> 02:45:45.920 align:start position:0%
simply because there have been
 
02:45:49.590 --> 02:45:49.600 align:start position:0%
years of stacking the deck within
 
02:45:53.110 --> 02:45:53.120 align:start position:0%
school boards school budget committees
 
02:45:55.429 --> 02:45:55.439 align:start position:0%
and what i mean by that is
 
02:45:57.269 --> 02:45:57.279 align:start position:0%
agreements have been made for
 
02:46:01.510 --> 02:46:01.520 align:start position:0%
resignations of members to occur after
 
02:46:04.309 --> 02:46:04.319 align:start position:0%
an election period to allow the school
 
02:46:06.230 --> 02:46:06.240 align:start position:0%
board school budget committee
 
02:46:06.240 --> 02:46:07.190 align:start position:0%
board school budget committee
to

02:46:07.190 --> 02:46:07.200 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:46:09.830 --> 02:46:09.840 align:start position:0%
appoint who they wanted instead of the
 
02:46:12.150 --> 02:46:12.160 align:start position:0%
taxpayers being allowed to choose who
 
02:46:13.269 --> 02:46:13.279 align:start position:0%
they want
 
02:46:15.670 --> 02:46:15.680 align:start position:0%
the taxpayers are the ones in charge and
 
02:46:17.590 --> 02:46:17.600 align:start position:0%
should be the ones that are represented
 
02:46:20.389 --> 02:46:20.399 align:start position:0%
the taxpayers needs and desires
 
02:46:22.830 --> 02:46:22.840 align:start position:0%
are not being met that way i think it's
 
02:46:26.550 --> 02:46:26.560 align:start position:0%
providing a a bad look
 
02:46:26.560 --> 02:46:28.070 align:start position:0%
providing a a bad look
to

02:46:28.070 --> 02:46:28.080 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:46:30.790 --> 02:46:30.800 align:start position:0%
any sort of
 
02:46:33.269 --> 02:46:33.279 align:start position:0%
board or budget committee to to do
 
02:46:37.429 --> 02:46:37.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:39.510 --> 02:46:39.520 align:start position:0%
are there any questions please
 
02:46:42.309 --> 02:46:42.319 align:start position:0%
okay uh representative klee
 
02:46:43.830 --> 02:46:43.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
02:46:45.910 --> 02:46:45.920 align:start position:0%
taking my question um
 
02:46:47.349 --> 02:46:47.359 align:start position:0%
this is something that we used to do at
 
02:46:48.630 --> 02:46:48.640 align:start position:0%
the beginning of our country with our
 
02:46:51.510 --> 02:46:51.520 align:start position:0%
vice president became the um the number
 
02:46:55.110 --> 02:46:55.120 align:start position:0%
two vote getter um and and i can see
 
02:46:56.790 --> 02:46:56.800 align:start position:0%
the points that you make and and it's
 
02:46:58.790 --> 02:46:58.800 align:start position:0%
shameful if that is that that is what's
 
02:47:01.590 --> 02:47:01.600 align:start position:0%
happening here in in our state but my
 
02:47:03.349 --> 02:47:03.359 align:start position:0%
question to you would be
 
02:47:03.359 --> 02:47:04.150 align:start position:0%
question to you would be
um

02:47:04.150 --> 02:47:04.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:47:06.150 --> 02:47:06.160 align:start position:0%
if the voters had the option so in other
 
02:47:08.870 --> 02:47:08.880 align:start position:0%
words the person who won wasn't on the
 
02:47:08.880 --> 02:47:09.990 align:start position:0%
words the person who won wasn't on the
ballot

02:47:09.990 --> 02:47:10.000 align:start position:0%
ballot
 
02:47:12.550 --> 02:47:12.560 align:start position:0%
might not the um the voters have voted
 
02:47:15.990 --> 02:47:16.000 align:start position:0%
more for three or four or five
 
02:47:16.000 --> 02:47:17.030 align:start position:0%
more for three or four or five
um

02:47:17.030 --> 02:47:17.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:47:19.349 --> 02:47:19.359 align:start position:0%
elected official and in the case where
 
02:47:22.550 --> 02:47:22.560 align:start position:0%
there's only two on the ballot uh might
 
02:47:24.389 --> 02:47:24.399 align:start position:0%
the um things had changed differently in
 
02:47:27.510 --> 02:47:27.520 align:start position:0%
a primary um which again is is something
 
02:47:29.429 --> 02:47:29.439 align:start position:0%
that i want to uh
 
02:47:31.429 --> 02:47:31.439 align:start position:0%
just a question if you haven't had an
 
02:47:33.670 --> 02:47:33.680 align:start position:0%
information on that thank you
 
02:47:35.110 --> 02:47:35.120 align:start position:0%
thank you let me let me restate what i'm
 
02:47:38.309 --> 02:47:38.319 align:start position:0%
hearing you say so if there are only two
 
02:47:38.319 --> 02:47:40.389 align:start position:0%
hearing you say so if there are only two
candidates

02:47:40.389 --> 02:47:40.399 align:start position:0%
candidates
 
02:47:42.710 --> 02:47:42.720 align:start position:0%
then one is elected
 
02:47:44.710 --> 02:47:44.720 align:start position:0%
and then the other one who
 
02:47:46.830 --> 02:47:46.840 align:start position:0%
did not win the
 
02:47:50.550 --> 02:47:50.560 align:start position:0%
race now is is is put in as a result of
 
02:47:52.230 --> 02:47:52.240 align:start position:0%
that resignation have i given that any
 
02:47:53.990 --> 02:47:54.000 align:start position:0%
consideration is that what you're asking
 
02:47:54.000 --> 02:47:55.510 align:start position:0%
consideration is that what you're asking
yes

02:47:55.510 --> 02:47:55.520 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:47:55.520 --> 02:47:56.309 align:start position:0%
yes
i

02:47:56.309 --> 02:47:56.319 align:start position:0%
i
 
02:47:58.389 --> 02:47:58.399 align:start position:0%
yeah that was the the premise of it but
 
02:48:00.950 --> 02:48:00.960 align:start position:0%
the question is if the if that were the
 
02:48:02.550 --> 02:48:02.560 align:start position:0%
only case there's only two
 
02:48:04.550 --> 02:48:04.560 align:start position:0%
obviously that would have been
 
02:48:06.309 --> 02:48:06.319 align:start position:0%
it's logical just put that person in but
 
02:48:07.910 --> 02:48:07.920 align:start position:0%
what if there are three four or five
 
02:48:09.110 --> 02:48:09.120 align:start position:0%
candidates or if there had been a
 
02:48:12.710 --> 02:48:12.720 align:start position:0%
primary etc so thank you so so next
 
02:48:14.790 --> 02:48:14.800 align:start position:0%
highest vote getter if it's within 90
 
02:48:17.269 --> 02:48:17.279 align:start position:0%
days of the election the next highest
 
02:48:18.710 --> 02:48:18.720 align:start position:0%
vote getter should be the one that's
 
02:48:21.269 --> 02:48:21.279 align:start position:0%
given the appointment
 
02:48:23.510 --> 02:48:23.520 align:start position:0%
may it clarify
 
02:48:25.670 --> 02:48:25.680 align:start position:0%
thank you i i guess i'm i'm not making
 
02:48:26.870 --> 02:48:26.880 align:start position:0%
myself clear
 
02:48:28.830 --> 02:48:28.840 align:start position:0%
the point i'm making is that
 
02:48:31.750 --> 02:48:31.760 align:start position:0%
um you want to put the second highest
 
02:48:33.910 --> 02:48:33.920 align:start position:0%
vote getter or the the next highest vote
 
02:48:36.469 --> 02:48:36.479 align:start position:0%
getter in from the person who who won
 
02:48:38.469 --> 02:48:38.479 align:start position:0%
but if the because you said that that's
 
02:48:39.910 --> 02:48:39.920 align:start position:0%
the voter speaking
 
02:48:42.630 --> 02:48:42.640 align:start position:0%
but if that person had not run
 
02:48:44.469 --> 02:48:44.479 align:start position:0%
would that person still maybe be the
 
02:48:45.910 --> 02:48:45.920 align:start position:0%
second highest vote getter because
 
02:48:47.590 --> 02:48:47.600 align:start position:0%
somebody else would have
 
02:48:49.510 --> 02:48:49.520 align:start position:0%
exceeded that
 
02:48:51.110 --> 02:48:51.120 align:start position:0%
i think that's why they kind of changed
 
02:48:53.510 --> 02:48:53.520 align:start position:0%
the whole so winner versus loser kind of
 
02:48:55.750 --> 02:48:55.760 align:start position:0%
thing the the second person may not have
 
02:48:57.429 --> 02:48:57.439 align:start position:0%
gotten as many votes if there was
 
02:48:59.830 --> 02:48:59.840 align:start position:0%
somebody else running right i i yeah i
 
02:49:01.510 --> 02:49:01.520 align:start position:0%
understand the question and i i believe
 
02:49:05.190 --> 02:49:05.200 align:start position:0%
that they should still be appointed
 
02:49:07.429 --> 02:49:07.439 align:start position:0%
fair enough thank you
 
02:49:09.510 --> 02:49:09.520 align:start position:0%
any further questions
 
02:49:13.429 --> 02:49:13.439 align:start position:0%
yes representative guthrie thank you for
 
02:49:24.309 --> 02:49:24.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:38.950 --> 02:49:38.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:41.030 --> 02:49:41.040 align:start position:0%
i i would say that it would be until the
 
02:49:42.950 --> 02:49:42.960 align:start position:0%
uh the next election
 
02:49:46.150 --> 02:49:46.160 align:start position:0%
to give the the voters a chance to
 
02:49:49.110 --> 02:49:49.120 align:start position:0%
to go back at it
 
02:50:00.950 --> 02:50:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:03.990 --> 02:50:04.000 align:start position:0%
is there another rsa that would would
 
02:50:06.550 --> 02:50:06.560 align:start position:0%
cover i don't know if there is one
 
02:50:08.630 --> 02:50:08.640 align:start position:0%
uh to cover
 
02:50:10.389 --> 02:50:10.399 align:start position:0%
i know what the intent is and that is
 
02:50:13.030 --> 02:50:13.040 align:start position:0%
what what the actually happens you stay
 
02:50:14.870 --> 02:50:14.880 align:start position:0%
on until you know you gotta run in like
 
02:50:16.150 --> 02:50:16.160 align:start position:0%
so but
 
02:50:18.550 --> 02:50:18.560 align:start position:0%
would you believe that it's not clear to
 
02:50:21.750 --> 02:50:21.760 align:start position:0%
me as to whether or not the term
 
02:50:24.710 --> 02:50:24.720 align:start position:0%
only extends to the next election i i
 
02:50:27.190 --> 02:50:27.200 align:start position:0%
believe that there is an rsa uh don't
 
02:50:29.030 --> 02:50:29.040 align:start position:0%
don't quote me on which one but i
 
02:50:30.630 --> 02:50:30.640 align:start position:0%
believe that there is an rsa that says
 
02:50:32.870 --> 02:50:32.880 align:start position:0%
that if you're appointed you only serve
 
02:50:35.110 --> 02:50:35.120 align:start position:0%
until the next election
 
02:50:37.110 --> 02:50:37.120 align:start position:0%
if that's the case i feel comfortable in
 
02:50:39.030 --> 02:50:39.040 align:start position:0%
but it wasn't clear to me thank you
 
02:50:41.110 --> 02:50:41.120 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you mr chairman
 
02:50:43.269 --> 02:50:43.279 align:start position:0%
representative power
 
02:50:45.030 --> 02:50:45.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
02:50:47.269 --> 02:50:47.279 align:start position:0%
taking my question so my question
 
02:50:49.429 --> 02:50:49.439 align:start position:0%
pertains to the use of
 
02:50:51.429 --> 02:50:51.439 align:start position:0%
resigns in the words resigns and
 
02:50:53.670 --> 02:50:53.680 align:start position:0%
resignation throughout the
 
02:50:53.680 --> 02:50:54.469 align:start position:0%
resignation throughout the
bill

02:50:54.469 --> 02:50:54.479 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:50:55.990 --> 02:50:56.000 align:start position:0%
framework here
 
02:50:58.870 --> 02:50:58.880 align:start position:0%
when i was a chair when i was the chair
 
02:51:01.269 --> 02:51:01.279 align:start position:0%
of a budget committee
 
02:51:03.349 --> 02:51:03.359 align:start position:0%
unfortunately one of our budget
 
02:51:05.030 --> 02:51:05.040 align:start position:0%
committee members
 
02:51:05.040 --> 02:51:06.389 align:start position:0%
committee members
died

02:51:06.389 --> 02:51:06.399 align:start position:0%
died
 
02:51:06.399 --> 02:51:07.429 align:start position:0%
died
while

02:51:07.429 --> 02:51:07.439 align:start position:0%
while
 
02:51:10.710 --> 02:51:10.720 align:start position:0%
holding that position does this bill
 
02:51:15.110 --> 02:51:15.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:17.269 --> 02:51:17.279 align:start position:0%
the bill as written right now does not
 
02:51:19.269 --> 02:51:19.279 align:start position:0%
mention that and i would
 
02:51:21.030 --> 02:51:21.040 align:start position:0%
i would request that that be amended in
 
02:51:22.389 --> 02:51:22.399 align:start position:0%
there because a
 
02:51:25.269 --> 02:51:25.279 align:start position:0%
death is is similar to that
 
02:51:25.279 --> 02:51:28.630 align:start position:0%
death is is similar to that
representative

02:51:28.630 --> 02:51:28.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:29.830 --> 02:51:29.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
02:51:31.429 --> 02:51:31.439 align:start position:0%
taking my question i
 
02:51:33.590 --> 02:51:33.600 align:start position:0%
hope i make this a little more clear but
 
02:51:36.389 --> 02:51:36.399 align:start position:0%
i can never be sure
 
02:51:38.469 --> 02:51:38.479 align:start position:0%
with reference to the
 
02:51:42.230 --> 02:51:42.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:44.550 --> 02:51:44.560 align:start position:0%
shall accept the resignation
 
02:51:47.910 --> 02:51:47.920 align:start position:0%
and declare the vacancy within 10 days
 
02:51:50.230 --> 02:51:50.240 align:start position:0%
so my question is a matter of timing to
 
02:51:50.240 --> 02:51:51.269 align:start position:0%
so my question is a matter of timing to
you

02:51:51.269 --> 02:51:51.279 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:51:51.279 --> 02:51:52.309 align:start position:0%
you
and

02:51:52.309 --> 02:51:52.319 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:51:54.230 --> 02:51:54.240 align:start position:0%
we they have a monthly
 
02:51:56.309 --> 02:51:56.319 align:start position:0%
a monthly meeting cycle why does it have
 
02:51:58.550 --> 02:51:58.560 align:start position:0%
to be within 10 days could it could it
 
02:52:00.790 --> 02:52:00.800 align:start position:0%
be could this be amended to say at the
 
02:52:02.790 --> 02:52:02.800 align:start position:0%
next regular
 
02:52:05.269 --> 02:52:05.279 align:start position:0%
meeting or is there some
 
02:52:07.590 --> 02:52:07.600 align:start position:0%
reason for the 10 days in there that i
 
02:52:08.870 --> 02:52:08.880 align:start position:0%
don't understand
 
02:52:11.110 --> 02:52:11.120 align:start position:0%
it can be amended for the next regular
 
02:52:11.120 --> 02:52:14.389 align:start position:0%
it can be amended for the next regular
meeting

02:52:14.389 --> 02:52:14.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:14.399 --> 02:52:16.150 align:start position:0%
 
power

02:52:16.150 --> 02:52:16.160 align:start position:0%
power
 
02:52:17.750 --> 02:52:17.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
02:52:19.990 --> 02:52:20.000 align:start position:0%
taking my question so um
 
02:52:21.269 --> 02:52:21.279 align:start position:0%
my question
 
02:52:24.710 --> 02:52:24.720 align:start position:0%
here pertains to line 11
 
02:52:28.309 --> 02:52:28.319 align:start position:0%
where the word beginning was struck and
 
02:52:32.150 --> 02:52:32.160 align:start position:0%
the word end was amended in
 
02:52:34.710 --> 02:52:34.720 align:start position:0%
why was that change made and
 
02:52:37.990 --> 02:52:38.000 align:start position:0%
would this be problematic because
 
02:52:41.590 --> 02:52:41.600 align:start position:0%
by eliminating beginning in in putting
 
02:52:43.750 --> 02:52:43.760 align:start position:0%
end in there
 
02:52:46.790 --> 02:52:46.800 align:start position:0%
of the filing period does that leave
 
02:52:48.150 --> 02:52:48.160 align:start position:0%
a gap
 
02:52:49.910 --> 02:52:49.920 align:start position:0%
so that's a great question and thank you
 
02:52:51.990 --> 02:52:52.000 align:start position:0%
for that
 
02:52:53.590 --> 02:52:53.600 align:start position:0%
as it stands right now the minute the
 
02:52:56.469 --> 02:52:56.479 align:start position:0%
filing period opens anybody who resigns
 
02:52:57.670 --> 02:52:57.680 align:start position:0%
or or
 
02:53:00.469 --> 02:53:00.479 align:start position:0%
as a result of death that seat is now
 
02:53:02.790 --> 02:53:02.800 align:start position:0%
vacant and cannot be filled via election
 
02:53:04.710 --> 02:53:04.720 align:start position:0%
it can only be filled via appointment if
 
02:53:07.349 --> 02:53:07.359 align:start position:0%
that is changed to the end of the filing
 
02:53:09.830 --> 02:53:09.840 align:start position:0%
period it will allow another seat to be
 
02:53:14.630 --> 02:53:14.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:16.469 --> 02:53:16.479 align:start position:0%
any other questions yes representative
 
02:53:16.479 --> 02:53:17.349 align:start position:0%
any other questions yes representative
ron

02:53:17.349 --> 02:53:17.359 align:start position:0%
ron
 
02:53:19.030 --> 02:53:19.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you mr
 
02:53:21.349 --> 02:53:21.359 align:start position:0%
eller for taking my questions
 
02:53:21.359 --> 02:53:22.150 align:start position:0%
eller for taking my questions
i'm

02:53:22.150 --> 02:53:22.160 align:start position:0%
i'm
 
02:53:25.590 --> 02:53:25.600 align:start position:0%
just a little bit concerned that um
 
02:53:27.990 --> 02:53:28.000 align:start position:0%
well well two things one you mentioned
 
02:53:28.000 --> 02:53:28.870 align:start position:0%
well well two things one you mentioned
that

02:53:28.870 --> 02:53:28.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:53:31.670 --> 02:53:31.680 align:start position:0%
this has been a major problem in
 
02:53:34.790 --> 02:53:34.800 align:start position:0%
merrimack correct correct um i don't
 
02:53:36.230 --> 02:53:36.240 align:start position:0%
know i don't know if i used the word
 
02:53:39.269 --> 02:53:39.279 align:start position:0%
major but maybe i did but yes go ahead i
 
02:53:41.910 --> 02:53:41.920 align:start position:0%
think you did um or something
 
02:53:41.920 --> 02:53:43.190 align:start position:0%
think you did um or something
similar

02:53:43.190 --> 02:53:43.200 align:start position:0%
similar
 
02:53:45.750 --> 02:53:45.760 align:start position:0%
i live in merrimack and i think i only
 
02:53:47.590 --> 02:53:47.600 align:start position:0%
know of one occurrence in the past maybe
 
02:53:49.670 --> 02:53:49.680 align:start position:0%
six or seven years do you know more yeah
 
02:53:51.190 --> 02:53:51.200 align:start position:0%
that's that's unfortunate the school
 
02:53:53.110 --> 02:53:53.120 align:start position:0%
board as a matter of fact there's only
 
02:53:55.670 --> 02:53:55.680 align:start position:0%
been one elected member of the school
 
02:53:58.230 --> 02:53:58.240 align:start position:0%
board actually two as of this past year
 
02:54:01.590 --> 02:54:01.600 align:start position:0%
uh going back uh that weren't prior
 
02:54:03.990 --> 02:54:04.000 align:start position:0%
appointed members going back six eight
 
02:54:05.910 --> 02:54:05.920 align:start position:0%
years now
 
02:54:07.750 --> 02:54:07.760 align:start position:0%
it's it's it's a very unfortunate
 
02:54:09.429 --> 02:54:09.439 align:start position:0%
situation the school budget committee
 
02:54:12.070 --> 02:54:12.080 align:start position:0%
operating the exact same way where a
 
02:54:13.910 --> 02:54:13.920 align:start position:0%
resignation would take place and there
 
02:54:15.670 --> 02:54:15.680 align:start position:0%
would be what i would call stacking the
 
02:54:15.680 --> 02:54:16.469 align:start position:0%
would be what i would call stacking the
deck

02:54:16.469 --> 02:54:16.479 align:start position:0%
deck
 
02:54:16.479 --> 02:54:17.429 align:start position:0%
deck
so

02:54:17.429 --> 02:54:17.439 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:54:19.670 --> 02:54:19.680 align:start position:0%
in fact you could take a look at of the
 
02:54:21.830 --> 02:54:21.840 align:start position:0%
school board in merrimack
 
02:54:24.469 --> 02:54:24.479 align:start position:0%
you could go back at least three members
 
02:54:26.950 --> 02:54:26.960 align:start position:0%
and see that
 
02:54:29.429 --> 02:54:29.439 align:start position:0%
they were appointed prior to winning an
 
02:54:29.439 --> 02:54:30.710 align:start position:0%
they were appointed prior to winning an
election

02:54:30.710 --> 02:54:30.720 align:start position:0%
election
 
02:54:32.950 --> 02:54:32.960 align:start position:0%
so yeah it has been a significant
 
02:54:35.110 --> 02:54:35.120 align:start position:0%
challenge i'll have to check that's not
 
02:54:37.510 --> 02:54:37.520 align:start position:0%
my recollection followed yes yes thank
 
02:54:37.520 --> 02:54:38.389 align:start position:0%
my recollection followed yes yes thank
you

02:54:38.389 --> 02:54:38.399 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:54:38.399 --> 02:54:39.349 align:start position:0%
you
um

02:54:39.349 --> 02:54:39.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:54:40.870 --> 02:54:40.880 align:start position:0%
in in in this
 
02:54:43.030 --> 02:54:43.040 align:start position:0%
in this bill you're proposing that
 
02:54:45.269 --> 02:54:45.279 align:start position:0%
people assume an office
 
02:54:48.469 --> 02:54:48.479 align:start position:0%
that they were not elected to
 
02:54:50.790 --> 02:54:50.800 align:start position:0%
or not appointed by someone who was
 
02:54:52.790 --> 02:54:52.800 align:start position:0%
elected just the fact that they came in
 
02:54:56.070 --> 02:54:56.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:57.830 --> 02:54:57.840 align:start position:0%
what i'm asking is that the board
 
02:54:57.840 --> 02:54:59.990 align:start position:0%
what i'm asking is that the board
appoint

02:54:59.990 --> 02:55:00.000 align:start position:0%
appoint
 
02:55:02.550 --> 02:55:02.560 align:start position:0%
the next highest vote getter so that
 
02:55:03.830 --> 02:55:03.840 align:start position:0%
would be
 
02:55:05.349 --> 02:55:05.359 align:start position:0%
that would be the the board making that
 
02:55:07.269 --> 02:55:07.279 align:start position:0%
vote okay but they don't have the choice
 
02:55:09.110 --> 02:55:09.120 align:start position:0%
they have to take that step within 90
 
02:55:11.190 --> 02:55:11.200 align:start position:0%
days is correct okay
 
02:55:12.870 --> 02:55:12.880 align:start position:0%
follow up one more photo
 
02:55:14.309 --> 02:55:14.319 align:start position:0%
i don't know if you're aware but i think
 
02:55:17.590 --> 02:55:17.600 align:start position:0%
there was an instance in 2018
 
02:55:20.469 --> 02:55:20.479 align:start position:0%
where that occurred but the next voter
 
02:55:23.030 --> 02:55:23.040 align:start position:0%
the next person on the list was donald
 
02:55:24.950 --> 02:55:24.960 align:start position:0%
trump he got five
 
02:55:26.550 --> 02:55:26.560 align:start position:0%
write-in votes
 
02:55:29.030 --> 02:55:29.040 align:start position:0%
the secretary of state
 
02:55:30.790 --> 02:55:30.800 align:start position:0%
declared him ineligible because
 
02:55:32.950 --> 02:55:32.960 align:start position:0%
merrimack was not his domicile and then
 
02:55:35.670 --> 02:55:35.680 align:start position:0%
the next person who got three votes
 
02:55:37.429 --> 02:55:37.439 align:start position:0%
actually didn't want the position he
 
02:55:40.070 --> 02:55:40.080 align:start position:0%
didn't run a write-in campaign so i'm
 
02:55:42.790 --> 02:55:42.800 align:start position:0%
wondering in that situation
 
02:55:46.309 --> 02:55:46.319 align:start position:0%
if there wasn't anyone on the ballot
 
02:55:48.469 --> 02:55:48.479 align:start position:0%
that had filed
 
02:55:51.030 --> 02:55:51.040 align:start position:0%
are you proposing that the
 
02:55:53.269 --> 02:55:53.279 align:start position:0%
board would then be forced to take the
 
02:55:56.550 --> 02:55:56.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:58.389 --> 02:55:58.399 align:start position:0%
i wouldn't say somebody who's a write-in
 
02:56:00.630 --> 02:56:00.640 align:start position:0%
i would say somebody who's actually
 
02:56:03.510 --> 02:56:03.520 align:start position:0%
gone out and campaigned and and actually
 
02:56:05.990 --> 02:56:06.000 align:start position:0%
filed and followed the normal steps uh
 
02:56:07.990 --> 02:56:08.000 align:start position:0%
anybody can write anybody in as you just
 
02:56:10.550 --> 02:56:10.560 align:start position:0%
uh as you just described so it would be
 
02:56:13.429 --> 02:56:13.439 align:start position:0%
somebody who has actually filed and and
 
02:56:16.469 --> 02:56:16.479 align:start position:0%
ran a campaign however
 
02:56:17.750 --> 02:56:17.760 align:start position:0%
you you bring up another kind of
 
02:56:19.110 --> 02:56:19.120 align:start position:0%
question in my mind and that is what if
 
02:56:21.030 --> 02:56:21.040 align:start position:0%
nobody what if nobody's there what if
 
02:56:23.429 --> 02:56:23.439 align:start position:0%
it's an unopposed race right then of
 
02:56:24.790 --> 02:56:24.800 align:start position:0%
course you're back to appointment
 
02:56:26.710 --> 02:56:26.720 align:start position:0%
situation so
 
02:56:26.720 --> 02:56:27.590 align:start position:0%
situation so
um

02:56:27.590 --> 02:56:27.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:56:31.429 --> 02:56:31.439 align:start position:0%
i hope that answers your question uh yep
 
02:56:32.469 --> 02:56:32.479 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:56:35.990 --> 02:56:36.000 align:start position:0%
it was sort of i i guess my concern is
 
02:56:38.309 --> 02:56:38.319 align:start position:0%
we have a history in new hampshire
 
02:56:41.429 --> 02:56:41.439 align:start position:0%
a proud history of having elected people
 
02:56:44.710 --> 02:56:44.720 align:start position:0%
have their m have made make the decision
 
02:56:46.630 --> 02:56:46.640 align:start position:0%
on who's going to a point in those
 
02:56:46.640 --> 02:56:48.150 align:start position:0%
on who's going to a point in those
situations

02:56:48.150 --> 02:56:48.160 align:start position:0%
situations
 
02:56:50.790 --> 02:56:50.800 align:start position:0%
um and they're not forced to say you
 
02:56:53.590 --> 02:56:53.600 align:start position:0%
have to have this person it's they still
 
02:56:53.600 --> 02:56:54.550 align:start position:0%
have to have this person it's they still
have

02:56:54.550 --> 02:56:54.560 align:start position:0%
have
 
02:56:57.830 --> 02:56:57.840 align:start position:0%
the uh free choice to determine who they
 
02:56:59.750 --> 02:56:59.760 align:start position:0%
want to appoint and they've been elected
 
02:57:00.950 --> 02:57:00.960 align:start position:0%
by people
 
02:57:00.960 --> 02:57:01.910 align:start position:0%
by people
um

02:57:01.910 --> 02:57:01.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:57:01.920 --> 02:57:03.590 align:start position:0%
um
so

02:57:03.590 --> 02:57:03.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:57:04.870 --> 02:57:04.880 align:start position:0%
i guess uh
 
02:57:06.790 --> 02:57:06.800 align:start position:0%
pertaining to the write-in if you're
 
02:57:08.710 --> 02:57:08.720 align:start position:0%
going to draft a new amendment you may
 
02:57:10.790 --> 02:57:10.800 align:start position:0%
want to clarify that because it's not
 
02:57:12.950 --> 02:57:12.960 align:start position:0%
specific in your language
 
02:57:14.469 --> 02:57:14.479 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
02:57:14.479 --> 02:57:16.950 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
representative

02:57:16.950 --> 02:57:16.960 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:57:19.269 --> 02:57:19.279 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you
 
02:57:21.429 --> 02:57:21.439 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
02:57:23.990 --> 02:57:24.000 align:start position:0%
i'm totally confused it almost seems
 
02:57:25.910 --> 02:57:25.920 align:start position:0%
like you're trying to create an
 
02:57:27.510 --> 02:57:27.520 align:start position:0%
alternative to
 
02:57:30.710 --> 02:57:30.720 align:start position:0%
duly electing process or democratic
 
02:57:33.910 --> 02:57:33.920 align:start position:0%
process of electing your representation
 
02:57:35.830 --> 02:57:35.840 align:start position:0%
either be it on school board or school
 
02:57:35.840 --> 02:57:36.790 align:start position:0%
either be it on school board or school
committee

02:57:36.790 --> 02:57:36.800 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:57:38.309 --> 02:57:38.319 align:start position:0%
and you know
 
02:57:39.750 --> 02:57:39.760 align:start position:0%
taking that
 
02:57:42.389 --> 02:57:42.399 align:start position:0%
away from the voter for the
 
02:57:42.399 --> 02:57:44.230 align:start position:0%
away from the voter for the
representation

02:57:44.230 --> 02:57:44.240 align:start position:0%
representation
 
02:57:45.910 --> 02:57:45.920 align:start position:0%
and you know
 
02:57:48.710 --> 02:57:48.720 align:start position:0%
isn't the voters have the right to do
 
02:57:52.870 --> 02:57:52.880 align:start position:0%
that and if you know and if they chose
 
02:57:56.070 --> 02:57:56.080 align:start position:0%
elected somebody for three year term and
 
02:57:58.950 --> 02:57:58.960 align:start position:0%
the person is not doing
 
02:58:00.230 --> 02:58:00.240 align:start position:0%
in but
 
02:58:02.950 --> 02:58:02.960 align:start position:0%
the voters have the ability
 
02:58:06.070 --> 02:58:06.080 align:start position:0%
to vote them out or it just feels like
 
02:58:08.630 --> 02:58:08.640 align:start position:0%
there's a alternative universe being
 
02:58:11.349 --> 02:58:11.359 align:start position:0%
created am i
 
02:58:13.429 --> 02:58:13.439 align:start position:0%
not seeing the point
 
02:58:13.439 --> 02:58:14.550 align:start position:0%
not seeing the point
so

02:58:14.550 --> 02:58:14.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:58:15.670 --> 02:58:15.680 align:start position:0%
right now
 
02:58:15.680 --> 02:58:16.710 align:start position:0%
right now
the

02:58:16.710 --> 02:58:16.720 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:58:18.469 --> 02:58:18.479 align:start position:0%
appointment is taking it out of the
 
02:58:20.389 --> 02:58:20.399 align:start position:0%
hands of the voters
 
02:58:20.399 --> 02:58:21.110 align:start position:0%
hands of the voters
so

02:58:21.110 --> 02:58:21.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:58:23.429 --> 02:58:23.439 align:start position:0%
if somebody resigned because they held
 
02:58:25.510 --> 02:58:25.520 align:start position:0%
their resignation until the elections
 
02:58:26.950 --> 02:58:26.960 align:start position:0%
were completed
 
02:58:29.830 --> 02:58:29.840 align:start position:0%
now that creates a vacancy
 
02:58:32.710 --> 02:58:32.720 align:start position:0%
which in turn will cause an appointment
 
02:58:34.790 --> 02:58:34.800 align:start position:0%
by the board that the taxpayers don't
 
02:58:37.910 --> 02:58:37.920 align:start position:0%
get an opportunity to have a say-so in
 
02:58:37.920 --> 02:58:39.030 align:start position:0%
get an opportunity to have a say-so in
so

02:58:39.030 --> 02:58:39.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:58:40.710 --> 02:58:40.720 align:start position:0%
if you go back to
 
02:58:43.030 --> 02:58:43.040 align:start position:0%
who all was running and if there is a
 
02:58:45.990 --> 02:58:46.000 align:start position:0%
second highest vote getter then instead
 
02:58:48.710 --> 02:58:48.720 align:start position:0%
of it stacking the deck against the the
 
02:58:50.630 --> 02:58:50.640 align:start position:0%
taxpayers or getting in you know
 
02:58:52.790 --> 02:58:52.800 align:start position:0%
somebody's best friend if you will now
 
02:58:55.030 --> 02:58:55.040 align:start position:0%
you've got a situation where the school
 
02:58:57.110 --> 02:58:57.120 align:start position:0%
board school budget committees know okay
 
02:58:59.349 --> 02:58:59.359 align:start position:0%
this is the next person i i that we have
 
02:59:01.910 --> 02:59:01.920 align:start position:0%
to choose if it's within 90 days however
 
02:59:04.469 --> 02:59:04.479 align:start position:0%
that being said maybe in the intent of
 
02:59:06.230 --> 02:59:06.240 align:start position:0%
this is that it will cause people to
 
02:59:08.950 --> 02:59:08.960 align:start position:0%
resign when the time is to resign
 
02:59:10.950 --> 02:59:10.960 align:start position:0%
instead of holding it and being
 
02:59:12.550 --> 02:59:12.560 align:start position:0%
strategic about
 
02:59:15.349 --> 02:59:15.359 align:start position:0%
being able to appoint somebody
 
02:59:18.150 --> 02:59:18.160 align:start position:0%
hopefully that answers your question
 
02:59:21.429 --> 02:59:21.439 align:start position:0%
doesn't clarify thank you
 
02:59:23.830 --> 02:59:23.840 align:start position:0%
yes representative power
 
02:59:25.269 --> 02:59:25.279 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
02:59:26.950 --> 02:59:26.960 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
02:59:28.389 --> 02:59:28.399 align:start position:0%
um my question
 
02:59:32.710 --> 02:59:32.720 align:start position:0%
is with regard to the the second highest
 
02:59:35.990 --> 02:59:36.000 align:start position:0%
vote getter in in the election
 
02:59:36.000 --> 02:59:39.830 align:start position:0%
vote getter in in the election
um

02:59:39.830 --> 02:59:39.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:42.630 --> 02:59:42.640 align:start position:0%
have you addressed um
 
02:59:46.070 --> 02:59:46.080 align:start position:0%
if that person is not interested in in
 
02:59:51.110 --> 02:59:51.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:54.070 --> 02:59:54.080 align:start position:0%
after the after the election yeah i mean
 
02:59:56.150 --> 02:59:56.160 align:start position:0%
obviously that would have to be asked of
 
02:59:58.150 --> 02:59:58.160 align:start position:0%
the uh of the recipient of the votes
 
02:59:59.269 --> 02:59:59.279 align:start position:0%
whether or not they would still be
 
03:00:02.790 --> 03:00:02.800 align:start position:0%
interested uh in attending uh or being
 
03:00:04.790 --> 03:00:04.800 align:start position:0%
appointed at that point uh i don't
 
03:00:07.429 --> 03:00:07.439 align:start position:0%
believe it specifies that in here um if
 
03:00:11.269 --> 03:00:11.279 align:start position:0%
there's multiple candidates then
 
03:00:12.630 --> 03:00:12.640 align:start position:0%
you know
 
03:00:14.870 --> 03:00:14.880 align:start position:0%
and they're not interested then it would
 
03:00:18.950 --> 03:00:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:18.960 --> 03:00:20.630 align:start position:0%
 
representative

03:00:20.630 --> 03:00:20.640 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:00:22.790 --> 03:00:22.800 align:start position:0%
um thank you again um and thank you
 
03:00:25.269 --> 03:00:25.279 align:start position:0%
again for taking my question again i'm
 
03:00:27.590 --> 03:00:27.600 align:start position:0%
going to go back down to the um the 90
 
03:00:27.600 --> 03:00:28.870 align:start position:0%
going to go back down to the um the 90
days

03:00:28.870 --> 03:00:28.880 align:start position:0%
days
 
03:00:30.950 --> 03:00:30.960 align:start position:0%
um i understood what you said and and i
 
03:00:33.590 --> 03:00:33.600 align:start position:0%
did find it disturbing the um someone
 
03:00:35.110 --> 03:00:35.120 align:start position:0%
taking a seat just so that they could
 
03:00:37.990 --> 03:00:38.000 align:start position:0%
resign and a favorite son or daughter be
 
03:00:40.389 --> 03:00:40.399 align:start position:0%
put into into place but my question is
 
03:00:42.710 --> 03:00:42.720 align:start position:0%
why wouldn't they wait 91 days
 
03:00:44.469 --> 03:00:44.479 align:start position:0%
before they resigned and they very well
 
03:00:44.479 --> 03:00:45.750 align:start position:0%
before they resigned and they very well
may

03:00:45.750 --> 03:00:45.760 align:start position:0%
may
 
03:00:48.309 --> 03:00:48.319 align:start position:0%
absolutely that is unfortunately there's
 
03:00:50.309 --> 03:00:50.319 align:start position:0%
there's ways to you know game the system
 
03:00:52.950 --> 03:00:52.960 align:start position:0%
any either way you go
 
03:00:54.630 --> 03:00:54.640 align:start position:0%
you know just trying to trying to make
 
03:00:57.429 --> 03:00:57.439 align:start position:0%
this a little bit more fair as best as
 
03:00:59.349 --> 03:00:59.359 align:start position:0%
possible to stop the stacking of the
 
03:01:02.950 --> 03:01:02.960 align:start position:0%
decks but absolutely it could however
 
03:01:04.469 --> 03:01:04.479 align:start position:0%
let's say that a member is going to be
 
03:01:06.790 --> 03:01:06.800 align:start position:0%
moving out of town and maybe they hold
 
03:01:09.910 --> 03:01:09.920 align:start position:0%
off just long enough maybe they can't do
 
03:01:11.990 --> 03:01:12.000 align:start position:0%
maybe they can't wait 90 more days
 
03:01:12.000 --> 03:01:12.950 align:start position:0%
maybe they can't wait 90 more days
so

03:01:12.950 --> 03:01:12.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:01:12.960 --> 03:01:15.190 align:start position:0%
so
um

03:01:15.190 --> 03:01:15.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:01:16.309 --> 03:01:16.319 align:start position:0%
father what
 
03:01:19.030 --> 03:01:19.040 align:start position:0%
mr chan go ahead um i understand what
 
03:01:20.469 --> 03:01:20.479 align:start position:0%
what you're saying
 
03:01:22.389 --> 03:01:22.399 align:start position:0%
but then if that be the case would they
 
03:01:24.710 --> 03:01:24.720 align:start position:0%
not not have run they might have tried
 
03:01:26.230 --> 03:01:26.240 align:start position:0%
to run somebody else
 
03:01:28.469 --> 03:01:28.479 align:start position:0%
in that situation
 
03:01:30.630 --> 03:01:30.640 align:start position:0%
can thinking that parties are running
 
03:01:30.640 --> 03:01:32.870 align:start position:0%
can thinking that parties are running
people

03:01:32.870 --> 03:01:32.880 align:start position:0%
people
 
03:01:33.910 --> 03:01:33.920 align:start position:0%
i don't think i'm following your
 
03:01:35.349 --> 03:01:35.359 align:start position:0%
question i'm sorry
 
03:01:37.750 --> 03:01:37.760 align:start position:0%
um you you said that um
 
03:01:39.830 --> 03:01:39.840 align:start position:0%
the possibility that um someone might
 
03:01:42.230 --> 03:01:42.240 align:start position:0%
not be able to wait the 90 days
 
03:01:44.870 --> 03:01:44.880 align:start position:0%
but if they ran with the intent
 
03:01:46.550 --> 03:01:46.560 align:start position:0%
that they were going to give their seat
 
03:01:48.550 --> 03:01:48.560 align:start position:0%
up to somebody else that could be
 
03:01:51.349 --> 03:01:51.359 align:start position:0%
appointed um i i felt that that's what
 
03:01:53.110 --> 03:01:53.120 align:start position:0%
you were kind of trying to say
 
03:01:54.790 --> 03:01:54.800 align:start position:0%
no not they're not running with an
 
03:01:57.269 --> 03:01:57.279 align:start position:0%
intent to give a seat up they're they're
 
03:02:00.550 --> 03:02:00.560 align:start position:0%
on the the board or committee now
 
03:02:03.429 --> 03:02:03.439 align:start position:0%
and their term is not up for re-election
 
03:02:06.309 --> 03:02:06.319 align:start position:0%
but yet they resign shortly after the
 
03:02:06.319 --> 03:02:08.070 align:start position:0%
but yet they resign shortly after the
election

03:02:08.070 --> 03:02:08.080 align:start position:0%
election
 
03:02:09.349 --> 03:02:09.359 align:start position:0%
so that
 
03:02:12.870 --> 03:02:12.880 align:start position:0%
uh in a strategic way so that uh
 
03:02:15.910 --> 03:02:15.920 align:start position:0%
the board can appoint a preferred person
 
03:02:17.269 --> 03:02:17.279 align:start position:0%
in their place
 
03:02:18.950 --> 03:02:18.960 align:start position:0%
rather than have the taxpayers vote on
 
03:02:18.960 --> 03:02:19.990 align:start position:0%
rather than have the taxpayers vote on
it

03:02:19.990 --> 03:02:20.000 align:start position:0%
it
 
03:02:23.830 --> 03:02:23.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:26.150 --> 03:02:26.160 align:start position:0%
yes representative majori thank you mr
 
03:02:27.269 --> 03:02:27.279 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking another
 
03:02:29.110 --> 03:02:29.120 align:start position:0%
question my question is the last
 
03:02:31.030 --> 03:02:31.040 align:start position:0%
sentence of roman
 
03:02:35.030 --> 03:02:35.040 align:start position:0%
3 sub a this is for the budget committee
 
03:02:36.309 --> 03:02:36.319 align:start position:0%
and it says if a seat on the budget
 
03:02:37.670 --> 03:02:37.680 align:start position:0%
committee becomes vacant during the
 
03:02:40.150 --> 03:02:40.160 align:start position:0%
filing period
 
03:02:42.150 --> 03:02:42.160 align:start position:0%
the replacement for such vacancy shall
 
03:02:44.790 --> 03:02:44.800 align:start position:0%
be added to the ballot
 
03:02:47.349 --> 03:02:47.359 align:start position:0%
so it's the filing period and then what
 
03:02:49.429 --> 03:02:49.439 align:start position:0%
has to happen
 
03:02:51.429 --> 03:02:51.439 align:start position:0%
am i do i understand correctly that
 
03:02:53.429 --> 03:02:53.439 align:start position:0%
during that filing period then the
 
03:02:55.830 --> 03:02:55.840 align:start position:0%
budget committee is going to appoint a
 
03:02:58.790 --> 03:02:58.800 align:start position:0%
person to run for that seat rather than
 
03:03:00.309 --> 03:03:00.319 align:start position:0%
have somebody
 
03:03:02.870 --> 03:03:02.880 align:start position:0%
volunteer to run for that seat if during
 
03:03:05.349 --> 03:03:05.359 align:start position:0%
that one week filing period
 
03:03:07.110 --> 03:03:07.120 align:start position:0%
that that person
 
03:03:09.349 --> 03:03:09.359 align:start position:0%
that that becomes vacant do i understand
 
03:03:09.359 --> 03:03:10.830 align:start position:0%
that that becomes vacant do i understand
that

03:03:10.830 --> 03:03:10.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:03:14.630 --> 03:03:14.640 align:start position:0%
so my interpretation of this and and the
 
03:03:17.030 --> 03:03:17.040 align:start position:0%
spirit of which it it should occur is
 
03:03:21.030 --> 03:03:21.040 align:start position:0%
that if a vacancy occurs during the
 
03:03:23.190 --> 03:03:23.200 align:start position:0%
filing period
 
03:03:24.469 --> 03:03:24.479 align:start position:0%
then that
 
03:03:28.309 --> 03:03:28.319 align:start position:0%
vacancy will be added to the ballot
 
03:03:30.790 --> 03:03:30.800 align:start position:0%
so that the taxpayers can fill that
 
03:03:32.950 --> 03:03:32.960 align:start position:0%
vacancy versus
 
03:03:38.309 --> 03:03:38.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:40.309 --> 03:03:40.319 align:start position:0%
i have a quick
 
03:03:43.349 --> 03:03:43.359 align:start position:0%
i don't do that very often
 
03:03:45.269 --> 03:03:45.279 align:start position:0%
so again and it could be me being wrong
 
03:03:47.750 --> 03:03:47.760 align:start position:0%
which is most often the case the filing
 
03:03:50.150 --> 03:03:50.160 align:start position:0%
period that that that you know
 
03:03:51.510 --> 03:03:51.520 align:start position:0%
six seven eight nine ten days whatever
 
03:03:53.030 --> 03:03:53.040 align:start position:0%
the number is
 
03:03:55.429 --> 03:03:55.439 align:start position:0%
i signed up oops
 
03:03:58.469 --> 03:03:58.479 align:start position:0%
i crossed my name out
 
03:03:59.910 --> 03:03:59.920 align:start position:0%
are you saying that there's there's some
 
03:04:01.910 --> 03:04:01.920 align:start position:0%
provision in there other than somebody
 
03:04:03.990 --> 03:04:04.000 align:start position:0%
else signing up in there that i may
 
03:04:05.910 --> 03:04:05.920 align:start position:0%
maybe i'm i'm getting so deep in the
 
03:04:07.830 --> 03:04:07.840 align:start position:0%
weeds that i'm it's not relative we
 
03:04:09.030 --> 03:04:09.040 align:start position:0%
might be talking about two separate
 
03:04:10.550 --> 03:04:10.560 align:start position:0%
things i'm talking about an existing
 
03:04:12.790 --> 03:04:12.800 align:start position:0%
member of budget committee school board
 
03:04:16.070 --> 03:04:16.080 align:start position:0%
right that resigns during the filing
 
03:04:16.080 --> 03:04:18.389 align:start position:0%
right that resigns during the filing
period

03:04:18.389 --> 03:04:18.399 align:start position:0%
period
 
03:04:20.309 --> 03:04:20.319 align:start position:0%
resigns during the firefight correct so
 
03:04:21.910 --> 03:04:21.920 align:start position:0%
they already hold office they resign
 
03:04:23.830 --> 03:04:23.840 align:start position:0%
during the filing period allow the
 
03:04:23.840 --> 03:04:25.510 align:start position:0%
during the filing period allow the
taxpayers

03:04:25.510 --> 03:04:25.520 align:start position:0%
taxpayers
 
03:04:27.910 --> 03:04:27.920 align:start position:0%
the voters to to vote in
 
03:04:29.510 --> 03:04:29.520 align:start position:0%
versus because there's still an
 
03:04:30.870 --> 03:04:30.880 align:start position:0%
opportunity to add that name to the
 
03:04:30.880 --> 03:04:31.750 align:start position:0%
opportunity to add that name to the
ballot

03:04:31.750 --> 03:04:31.760 align:start position:0%
ballot
 
03:04:33.190 --> 03:04:33.200 align:start position:0%
ballots haven't been printed the filing
 
03:04:34.790 --> 03:04:34.800 align:start position:0%
period is still open
 
03:04:34.800 --> 03:04:35.590 align:start position:0%
period is still open
uh

03:04:35.590 --> 03:04:35.600 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:04:37.590 --> 03:04:37.600 align:start position:0%
add that person to the ballot so that
 
03:04:39.510 --> 03:04:39.520 align:start position:0%
the taxpayers have to say so and what
 
03:04:39.520 --> 03:04:42.150 align:start position:0%
the taxpayers have to say so and what
occurs

03:04:42.150 --> 03:04:42.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:44.469 --> 03:04:44.479 align:start position:0%
yes sir representative power
 
03:04:45.910 --> 03:04:45.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
03:04:47.510 --> 03:04:47.520 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
03:04:49.670 --> 03:04:49.680 align:start position:0%
it's a follow-up to my previous question
 
03:04:52.070 --> 03:04:52.080 align:start position:0%
i was trying to formulate
 
03:04:54.550 --> 03:04:54.560 align:start position:0%
what i wanted to ask so it
 
03:04:57.190 --> 03:04:57.200 align:start position:0%
we'll let's go back to line 17
 
03:05:00.309 --> 03:05:00.319 align:start position:0%
with regard to the second highest number
 
03:05:03.269 --> 03:05:03.279 align:start position:0%
so if i understood your explanation
 
03:05:06.309 --> 03:05:06.319 align:start position:0%
um the person with the second highest
 
03:05:08.870 --> 03:05:08.880 align:start position:0%
number of votes would be offered
 
03:05:11.990 --> 03:05:12.000 align:start position:0%
the pos the the the seat on the board
 
03:05:15.110 --> 03:05:15.120 align:start position:0%
and if they for whatever reason decided
 
03:05:17.590 --> 03:05:17.600 align:start position:0%
or rejected that opportunity
 
03:05:20.070 --> 03:05:20.080 align:start position:0%
then it would go to an appointment so my
 
03:05:22.950 --> 03:05:22.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:25.830 --> 03:05:25.840 align:start position:0%
why is that the methodology and and why
 
03:05:29.429 --> 03:05:29.439 align:start position:0%
not change second to next highest why
 
03:05:31.110 --> 03:05:31.120 align:start position:0%
not exhaust
 
03:05:33.830 --> 03:05:33.840 align:start position:0%
the list of
 
03:05:36.389 --> 03:05:36.399 align:start position:0%
people who filed in ran
 
03:05:41.830 --> 03:05:41.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:44.150 --> 03:05:44.160 align:start position:0%
that is a
 
03:05:45.910 --> 03:05:45.920 align:start position:0%
an excellent point that you bring up and
 
03:05:47.750 --> 03:05:47.760 align:start position:0%
and i would be in support of that of of
 
03:05:49.590 --> 03:05:49.600 align:start position:0%
exhausting that list
 
03:05:52.550 --> 03:05:52.560 align:start position:0%
rather than uh just going with with one
 
03:05:54.150 --> 03:05:54.160 align:start position:0%
person i think that would actually bring
 
03:05:56.870 --> 03:05:56.880 align:start position:0%
some additional fairness to it
 
03:05:59.110 --> 03:05:59.120 align:start position:0%
yes representative stavis
 
03:06:00.630 --> 03:06:00.640 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
03:06:02.550 --> 03:06:02.560 align:start position:0%
taking in another question which may
 
03:06:04.150 --> 03:06:04.160 align:start position:0%
again be flip
 
03:06:05.910 --> 03:06:05.920 align:start position:0%
that's why i apologize
 
03:06:08.870 --> 03:06:08.880 align:start position:0%
so in in the first instance
 
03:06:08.880 --> 03:06:10.070 align:start position:0%
so in in the first instance
where

03:06:10.070 --> 03:06:10.080 align:start position:0%
where
 
03:06:12.150 --> 03:06:12.160 align:start position:0%
a vacancy becomes
 
03:06:14.309 --> 03:06:14.319 align:start position:0%
open because somebody resigned during
 
03:06:16.469 --> 03:06:16.479 align:start position:0%
the filing period
 
03:06:19.190 --> 03:06:19.200 align:start position:0%
this bill states that the participation
 
03:06:22.950 --> 03:06:22.960 align:start position:0%
of the tax payers by an election is
 
03:06:25.590 --> 03:06:25.600 align:start position:0%
paramount is important should be done
 
03:06:29.110 --> 03:06:29.120 align:start position:0%
but then in the next paragraph it says
 
03:06:31.750 --> 03:06:31.760 align:start position:0%
it's okay to appoint someone
 
03:06:33.750 --> 03:06:33.760 align:start position:0%
i i don't i don't understand this bill
 
03:06:39.750 --> 03:06:39.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:43.110 --> 03:06:43.120 align:start position:0%
the the the spirit of the bill
 
03:06:43.120 --> 03:06:44.070 align:start position:0%
the the the spirit of the bill
is

03:06:44.070 --> 03:06:44.080 align:start position:0%
is
 
03:06:46.469 --> 03:06:46.479 align:start position:0%
pretty simple to me but i'm not in the
 
03:06:48.630 --> 03:06:48.640 align:start position:0%
the legal side of things it's
 
03:06:50.950 --> 03:06:50.960 align:start position:0%
if a position comes open during the
 
03:06:53.590 --> 03:06:53.600 align:start position:0%
filing period you allow the taxpayers to
 
03:06:56.790 --> 03:06:56.800 align:start position:0%
vote on who that's going to be so you
 
03:07:00.790 --> 03:07:00.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:04.790 --> 03:07:04.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:06.870 --> 03:07:06.880 align:start position:0%
taxpayers are
 
03:07:09.269 --> 03:07:09.279 align:start position:0%
not allowed to vote
 
03:07:12.710 --> 03:07:12.720 align:start position:0%
they have the right to vote
 
03:07:14.550 --> 03:07:14.560 align:start position:0%
i i think we may be in semantics how
 
03:07:17.110 --> 03:07:17.120 align:start position:0%
about we call them the voters
 
03:07:20.550 --> 03:07:20.560 align:start position:0%
correct same same point okay so they get
 
03:07:22.230 --> 03:07:22.240 align:start position:0%
to vote if it's on the ballot they can
 
03:07:24.070 --> 03:07:24.080 align:start position:0%
choose whether to vote for that person
 
03:07:25.670 --> 03:07:25.680 align:start position:0%
they don't get to vote in the second
 
03:07:30.230 --> 03:07:30.240 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:33.190 --> 03:07:33.200 align:start position:0%
they they voted prior to that
 
03:07:35.349 --> 03:07:35.359 align:start position:0%
during the election they voted for who
 
03:07:37.990 --> 03:07:38.000 align:start position:0%
they wanted and however many seats were
 
03:07:40.630 --> 03:07:40.640 align:start position:0%
open if that person if their main vote
 
03:07:42.790 --> 03:07:42.800 align:start position:0%
getter the the person who won the vote
 
03:07:43.990 --> 03:07:44.000 align:start position:0%
or that the highest number of vote
 
03:07:45.830 --> 03:07:45.840 align:start position:0%
getters were not
 
03:07:45.840 --> 03:07:46.710 align:start position:0%
getters were not
uh

03:07:46.710 --> 03:07:46.720 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:07:49.670 --> 03:07:49.680 align:start position:0%
chose not to accept the office then
 
03:07:49.680 --> 03:07:51.670 align:start position:0%
chose not to accept the office then
um

03:07:51.670 --> 03:07:51.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:07:53.429 --> 03:07:53.439 align:start position:0%
or chose not to run i mean then they
 
03:07:54.389 --> 03:07:54.399 align:start position:0%
would be
 
03:07:56.550 --> 03:07:56.560 align:start position:0%
more than likely the winning vote
 
03:08:01.110 --> 03:08:01.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:03.030 --> 03:08:03.040 align:start position:0%
well we can agree to disagree on that
 
03:08:04.550 --> 03:08:04.560 align:start position:0%
but okay thank you for answering the
 
03:08:04.560 --> 03:08:06.550 align:start position:0%
but okay thank you for answering the
question

03:08:06.550 --> 03:08:06.560 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:08:06.560 --> 03:08:09.030 align:start position:0%
question
representative

03:08:09.030 --> 03:08:09.040 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:08:10.550 --> 03:08:10.560 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you again for taking
 
03:08:12.469 --> 03:08:12.479 align:start position:0%
my question so in that same vein the
 
03:08:15.910 --> 03:08:15.920 align:start position:0%
replacement shall be added
 
03:08:18.070 --> 03:08:18.080 align:start position:0%
that makes an assumption that does that
 
03:08:20.230 --> 03:08:20.240 align:start position:0%
make an assumption that the replacement
 
03:08:22.070 --> 03:08:22.080 align:start position:0%
must run
 
03:08:24.469 --> 03:08:24.479 align:start position:0%
or could that word shall be changed to
 
03:08:26.550 --> 03:08:26.560 align:start position:0%
may because this says the replacement
 
03:08:29.429 --> 03:08:29.439 align:start position:0%
shall be added to the ballot
 
03:08:30.950 --> 03:08:30.960 align:start position:0%
but i have not assumed that that
 
03:08:34.230 --> 03:08:34.240 align:start position:0%
replacement wants to run
 
03:08:35.269 --> 03:08:35.279 align:start position:0%
well if there's nobody you run then
 
03:08:37.590 --> 03:08:37.600 align:start position:0%
there's nobody to add
 
03:08:39.910 --> 03:08:39.920 align:start position:0%
so what that's saying is is if there's
 
03:08:41.990 --> 03:08:42.000 align:start position:0%
somebody that's wanting to run you have
 
03:08:43.590 --> 03:08:43.600 align:start position:0%
to accept
 
03:08:46.630 --> 03:08:46.640 align:start position:0%
their application obviously with meeting
 
03:08:48.790 --> 03:08:48.800 align:start position:0%
all the criteria
 
03:08:51.830 --> 03:08:51.840 align:start position:0%
until the end of the filing period
 
03:08:54.309 --> 03:08:54.319 align:start position:0%
so basically if there's four spots open
 
03:08:56.710 --> 03:08:56.720 align:start position:0%
and somebody passes away or resigns it
 
03:08:59.349 --> 03:08:59.359 align:start position:0%
now leaves a fifth spot open that's all
 
03:08:59.359 --> 03:09:03.750 align:start position:0%
now leaves a fifth spot open that's all
representative

03:09:03.750 --> 03:09:03.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:05.190 --> 03:09:05.200 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
03:09:07.349 --> 03:09:07.359 align:start position:0%
taking my question i want to follow up
 
03:09:09.750 --> 03:09:09.760 align:start position:0%
on representative majori's point on
 
03:09:11.990 --> 03:09:12.000 align:start position:0%
lines eight and nine if a seat on the
 
03:09:13.910 --> 03:09:13.920 align:start position:0%
budget committee becomes vacant during
 
03:09:15.910 --> 03:09:15.920 align:start position:0%
the filing period for a budget committee
 
03:09:15.920 --> 03:09:17.030 align:start position:0%
the filing period for a budget committee
election

03:09:17.030 --> 03:09:17.040 align:start position:0%
election
 
03:09:19.190 --> 03:09:19.200 align:start position:0%
the replacement of such vacancy shall be
 
03:09:21.110 --> 03:09:21.120 align:start position:0%
added to the ballot for budget committee
 
03:09:21.120 --> 03:09:22.790 align:start position:0%
added to the ballot for budget committee
election

03:09:22.790 --> 03:09:22.800 align:start position:0%
election
 
03:09:25.110 --> 03:09:25.120 align:start position:0%
are you aware that
 
03:09:27.750 --> 03:09:27.760 align:start position:0%
for all other seats in school districts
 
03:09:29.429 --> 03:09:29.439 align:start position:0%
or towns
 
03:09:32.790 --> 03:09:32.800 align:start position:0%
this would conflict with that
 
03:09:35.030 --> 03:09:35.040 align:start position:0%
i i'm wondering why you picked out
 
03:09:36.630 --> 03:09:36.640 align:start position:0%
budget committee but didn't include
 
03:09:38.630 --> 03:09:38.640 align:start position:0%
school board or town
 
03:09:41.590 --> 03:09:41.600 align:start position:0%
board of selectmen or town council
 
03:09:44.870 --> 03:09:44.880 align:start position:0%
because in in current rsas
 
03:09:47.590 --> 03:09:47.600 align:start position:0%
if there is a vacancy that occurs during
 
03:09:50.229 --> 03:09:50.239 align:start position:0%
the filing period
 
03:09:52.790 --> 03:09:52.800 align:start position:0%
following that election
 
03:09:56.070 --> 03:09:56.080 align:start position:0%
the governing board appoints someone to
 
03:09:58.790 --> 03:09:58.800 align:start position:0%
fill that term until the next election
 
03:10:01.349 --> 03:10:01.359 align:start position:0%
where then the unexpired term
 
03:10:03.190 --> 03:10:03.200 align:start position:0%
is on the ballot
 
03:10:04.630 --> 03:10:04.640 align:start position:0%
why would this
 
03:10:07.670 --> 03:10:07.680 align:start position:0%
be something special and not apply to
 
03:10:09.269 --> 03:10:09.279 align:start position:0%
all of those other
 
03:10:10.950 --> 03:10:10.960 align:start position:0%
governing bodies
 
03:10:12.710 --> 03:10:12.720 align:start position:0%
it should apply to all governing bodies
 
03:10:17.110 --> 03:10:17.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:20.150 --> 03:10:20.160 align:start position:0%
okay uh seeing no additional uh
 
03:10:20.160 --> 03:10:21.349 align:start position:0%
okay uh seeing no additional uh
comments

03:10:21.349 --> 03:10:21.359 align:start position:0%
comments
 
03:10:22.469 --> 03:10:22.479 align:start position:0%
i'd like to thank you for your
 
03:10:24.229 --> 03:10:24.239 align:start position:0%
participation and
 
03:10:25.990 --> 03:10:26.000 align:start position:0%
then we're going to hear from the nhma
 
03:10:29.590 --> 03:10:29.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:31.429 --> 03:10:31.439 align:start position:0%
well well uh
 
03:10:33.670 --> 03:10:33.680 align:start position:0%
he's coming to the microphone a question
 
03:10:36.469 --> 03:10:36.479 align:start position:0%
for the committee
 
03:10:39.510 --> 03:10:39.520 align:start position:0%
we have two more bills to hear today
 
03:10:41.590 --> 03:10:41.600 align:start position:0%
after after the
 
03:10:43.750 --> 03:10:43.760 align:start position:0%
completion of this one
 
03:10:47.750 --> 03:10:47.760 align:start position:0%
my thoughts are to recess one of them
 
03:10:50.150 --> 03:10:50.160 align:start position:0%
and that leaves us with one bill
 
03:10:51.670 --> 03:10:51.680 align:start position:0%
and so the question is do you want to
 
03:10:53.030 --> 03:10:53.040 align:start position:0%
plow through
 
03:10:55.510 --> 03:10:55.520 align:start position:0%
and hit that bill and then call it a day
 
03:10:57.110 --> 03:10:57.120 align:start position:0%
or do you want to take a lunch break and
 
03:10:59.349 --> 03:10:59.359 align:start position:0%
come back
 
03:11:04.150 --> 03:11:04.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:04.160 --> 03:11:05.670 align:start position:0%
 
no

03:11:05.670 --> 03:11:05.680 align:start position:0%
no
 
03:11:05.680 --> 03:11:06.630 align:start position:0%
no
mr

03:11:06.630 --> 03:11:06.640 align:start position:0%
mr
 
03:11:12.309 --> 03:11:12.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:18.630 --> 03:11:18.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:20.469 --> 03:11:20.479 align:start position:0%
mr chairman yes
 
03:11:22.309 --> 03:11:22.319 align:start position:0%
could you tell me which bill we're going
 
03:11:24.630 --> 03:11:24.640 align:start position:0%
to hear we're going to plow through and
 
03:11:26.309 --> 03:11:26.319 align:start position:0%
which one we're going to hold we're
 
03:11:30.870 --> 03:11:30.880 align:start position:0%
going to hear uh hb 1307 okay
 
03:11:30.880 --> 03:11:31.990 align:start position:0%
going to hear uh hb 1307 okay
and

03:11:31.990 --> 03:11:32.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:11:34.870 --> 03:11:34.880 align:start position:0%
i'm going to do a hold on hb 12
 
03:11:34.880 --> 03:11:36.550 align:start position:0%
i'm going to do a hold on hb 12
38.

03:11:36.550 --> 03:11:36.560 align:start position:0%
38.
 
03:11:36.560 --> 03:11:52.550 align:start position:0%
38.
213

03:11:52.550 --> 03:11:52.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:54.790 --> 03:11:54.800 align:start position:0%
go ahead mr graves thank you mr chair
 
03:11:55.910 --> 03:11:55.920 align:start position:0%
nate grace for the new hampshire
 
03:11:57.590 --> 03:11:57.600 align:start position:0%
municipal association i'll try to be
 
03:11:59.110 --> 03:11:59.120 align:start position:0%
brief as possible
 
03:12:00.950 --> 03:12:00.960 align:start position:0%
uh we oppose this bill
 
03:12:02.950 --> 03:12:02.960 align:start position:0%
i don't think that this bill is workable
 
03:12:05.830 --> 03:12:05.840 align:start position:0%
as written there are a number of issues
 
03:12:08.150 --> 03:12:08.160 align:start position:0%
a couple that i wanted to to point out
 
03:12:11.030 --> 03:12:11.040 align:start position:0%
that weren't uh already pointed out by
 
03:12:12.710 --> 03:12:12.720 align:start position:0%
the committee today
 
03:12:14.309 --> 03:12:14.319 align:start position:0%
is the bill as written does not address
 
03:12:17.830 --> 03:12:17.840 align:start position:0%
rsa 669 colon 71 which addresses
 
03:12:20.070 --> 03:12:20.080 align:start position:0%
vacancies in the budget committee um
 
03:12:22.469 --> 03:12:22.479 align:start position:0%
that that statute specifically says that
 
03:12:24.870 --> 03:12:24.880 align:start position:0%
they're filled under rsa 32 colon 15
 
03:12:26.229 --> 03:12:26.239 align:start position:0%
romans 7.
 
03:12:28.469 --> 03:12:28.479 align:start position:0%
obviously this would add a new uh
 
03:12:29.910 --> 03:12:29.920 align:start position:0%
provision to the budget committee which
 
03:12:32.630 --> 03:12:32.640 align:start position:0%
is not under roman 7.
 
03:12:36.469 --> 03:12:36.479 align:start position:0%
under 32 15 roman 7 it's there's a line
 
03:12:37.910 --> 03:12:37.920 align:start position:0%
that states in municipalities where
 
03:12:39.590 --> 03:12:39.600 align:start position:0%
members at large are elected vacancies
 
03:12:40.870 --> 03:12:40.880 align:start position:0%
shall be filled by appointment by the
 
03:12:42.469 --> 03:12:42.479 align:start position:0%
budget committee
 
03:12:44.870 --> 03:12:44.880 align:start position:0%
that would seemingly contradict
 
03:12:47.510 --> 03:12:47.520 align:start position:0%
some of the language provided here in in
 
03:12:49.349 --> 03:12:49.359 align:start position:0%
the bill is written
 
03:12:50.870 --> 03:12:50.880 align:start position:0%
as far as the bill
 
03:12:52.550 --> 03:12:52.560 align:start position:0%
as written goes
 
03:12:54.070 --> 03:12:54.080 align:start position:0%
as pointed out by representative power
 
03:12:55.590 --> 03:12:55.600 align:start position:0%
earlier today
 
03:12:57.590 --> 03:12:57.600 align:start position:0%
it says if a member resigns there's
 
03:13:00.389 --> 03:13:00.399 align:start position:0%
nothing addressing whether a member dies
 
03:13:02.710 --> 03:13:02.720 align:start position:0%
whether they move out of town under 32
 
03:13:04.950 --> 03:13:04.960 align:start position:0%
15 55 anything that would trigger a
 
03:13:06.550 --> 03:13:06.560 align:start position:0%
vacancy to occur
 
03:13:09.349 --> 03:13:09.359 align:start position:0%
it's just under a specific instance
 
03:13:09.359 --> 03:13:10.150 align:start position:0%
it's just under a specific instance
um

03:13:10.150 --> 03:13:10.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:13:10.160 --> 03:13:11.510 align:start position:0%
um
further

03:13:11.510 --> 03:13:11.520 align:start position:0%
further
 
03:13:13.110 --> 03:13:13.120 align:start position:0%
the bill provides the moderator shall
 
03:13:16.469 --> 03:13:16.479 align:start position:0%
declare the vacancy within 10 days
 
03:13:19.510 --> 03:13:19.520 align:start position:0%
that's unusual i mean the vacancy occurs
 
03:13:21.510 --> 03:13:21.520 align:start position:0%
as soon as the person resigns dies
 
03:13:23.830 --> 03:13:23.840 align:start position:0%
whatever and somebody could be appointed
 
03:13:25.670 --> 03:13:25.680 align:start position:0%
the next day by
 
03:13:28.550 --> 03:13:28.560 align:start position:0%
the proper authority um it's strange
 
03:13:29.910 --> 03:13:29.920 align:start position:0%
that there would be a
 
03:13:31.910 --> 03:13:31.920 align:start position:0%
a 10-day window here that that would be
 
03:13:34.309 --> 03:13:34.319 align:start position:0%
required to occur in
 
03:13:37.510 --> 03:13:37.520 align:start position:0%
um underline five um
 
03:13:39.910 --> 03:13:39.920 align:start position:0%
i believe the
 
03:13:42.070 --> 03:13:42.080 align:start position:0%
that the reference to paragraph three
 
03:13:45.349 --> 03:13:45.359 align:start position:0%
should be paragraph seven romans seven
 
03:13:48.150 --> 03:13:48.160 align:start position:0%
simply because paragraph three is uh the
 
03:13:50.950 --> 03:13:50.960 align:start position:0%
provision that provides
 
03:13:52.950 --> 03:13:52.960 align:start position:0%
how the legislative body determines how
 
03:13:54.710 --> 03:13:54.720 align:start position:0%
the budget committee is to be
 
03:13:56.070 --> 03:13:56.080 align:start position:0%
created whether that's appointed or
 
03:13:56.080 --> 03:13:57.670 align:start position:0%
created whether that's appointed or
elected

03:13:57.670 --> 03:13:57.680 align:start position:0%
elected
 
03:13:57.680 --> 03:14:00.389 align:start position:0%
elected
um

03:14:00.389 --> 03:14:00.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:03.510 --> 03:14:03.520 align:start position:0%
as as the committee addressed uh
 
03:14:04.950 --> 03:14:04.960 align:start position:0%
numerous committee members addressed
 
03:14:04.960 --> 03:14:06.309 align:start position:0%
numerous committee members addressed
today

03:14:06.309 --> 03:14:06.319 align:start position:0%
today
 
03:14:08.389 --> 03:14:08.399 align:start position:0%
lines six and seven about the next
 
03:14:10.870 --> 03:14:10.880 align:start position:0%
highest number of votes um is just
 
03:14:12.550 --> 03:14:12.560 align:start position:0%
unclear what happens in the instance of
 
03:14:14.309 --> 03:14:14.319 align:start position:0%
a write-in or someone who's not
 
03:14:16.070 --> 03:14:16.080 align:start position:0%
interested or what do you do if you're
 
03:14:17.750 --> 03:14:17.760 align:start position:0%
on you know the third person on the
 
03:14:19.349 --> 03:14:19.359 align:start position:0%
ballot um
 
03:14:22.309 --> 03:14:22.319 align:start position:0%
it seems sort of like this is creating
 
03:14:24.309 --> 03:14:24.319 align:start position:0%
a variation of ranked choice voting
 
03:14:25.750 --> 03:14:25.760 align:start position:0%
where the voters don't actually pick
 
03:14:27.750 --> 03:14:27.760 align:start position:0%
their second choice you just kind of go
 
03:14:29.269 --> 03:14:29.279 align:start position:0%
to the next one down and that's who gets
 
03:14:30.630 --> 03:14:30.640 align:start position:0%
filled in
 
03:14:33.030 --> 03:14:33.040 align:start position:0%
and then lastly um
 
03:14:35.269 --> 03:14:35.279 align:start position:0%
under lines eight and nine
 
03:14:35.279 --> 03:14:36.950 align:start position:0%
under lines eight and nine
um

03:14:36.950 --> 03:14:36.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:14:39.590 --> 03:14:39.600 align:start position:0%
having the the position be listed on the
 
03:14:41.670 --> 03:14:41.680 align:start position:0%
ballot if there's a resignation during
 
03:14:44.389 --> 03:14:44.399 align:start position:0%
the filing period is also unusual what
 
03:14:46.150 --> 03:14:46.160 align:start position:0%
if the resignation is the last day you
 
03:14:48.070 --> 03:14:48.080 align:start position:0%
have like half an hour to tell everyone
 
03:14:51.110 --> 03:14:51.120 align:start position:0%
in town there's an opening and so quick
 
03:14:54.229 --> 03:14:54.239 align:start position:0%
get your your your paperwork in um
 
03:14:55.750 --> 03:14:55.760 align:start position:0%
that's just not
 
03:14:58.710 --> 03:14:58.720 align:start position:0%
workable as as a practical matter
 
03:15:00.389 --> 03:15:00.399 align:start position:0%
um i'm happy to answer any questions the
 
03:15:01.830 --> 03:15:01.840 align:start position:0%
committee has
 
03:15:03.590 --> 03:15:03.600 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
03:15:03.600 --> 03:15:05.990 align:start position:0%
any questions
representative

03:15:05.990 --> 03:15:06.000 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:15:09.830 --> 03:15:09.840 align:start position:0%
you mr chair thank you mr grace for
 
03:15:12.950 --> 03:15:12.960 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
03:15:15.110 --> 03:15:15.120 align:start position:0%
you kind of answered
 
03:15:17.670 --> 03:15:17.680 align:start position:0%
part of my confusion in terms of
 
03:15:20.469 --> 03:15:20.479 align:start position:0%
recruiting you know you brought out the
 
03:15:21.990 --> 03:15:22.000 align:start position:0%
rank choice
 
03:15:26.190 --> 03:15:26.200 align:start position:0%
and would it be possible for the
 
03:15:29.030 --> 03:15:29.040 align:start position:0%
municipalities or the school boards to
 
03:15:30.950 --> 03:15:30.960 align:start position:0%
have that option
 
03:15:33.670 --> 03:15:33.680 align:start position:0%
in their bylaws to say rank choice and
 
03:15:35.590 --> 03:15:35.600 align:start position:0%
you know to begin with there's no
 
03:15:35.600 --> 03:15:36.950 align:start position:0%
you know to begin with there's no
doubt

03:15:36.950 --> 03:15:36.960 align:start position:0%
doubt
 
03:15:38.389 --> 03:15:38.399 align:start position:0%
in terms of
 
03:15:40.309 --> 03:15:40.319 align:start position:0%
how we are electing so the voters know
 
03:15:42.309 --> 03:15:42.319 align:start position:0%
when they are electing somebody if it
 
03:15:43.590 --> 03:15:43.600 align:start position:0%
doesn't work
 
03:15:46.229 --> 03:15:46.239 align:start position:0%
there is the options that whoever they
 
03:15:48.950 --> 03:15:48.960 align:start position:0%
elect the second would be so that you
 
03:15:51.030 --> 03:15:51.040 align:start position:0%
know from the gecko they have that
 
03:15:51.040 --> 03:15:52.229 align:start position:0%
know from the gecko they have that
choice

03:15:52.229 --> 03:15:52.239 align:start position:0%
choice
 
03:15:53.750 --> 03:15:53.760 align:start position:0%
a ranked choice voting is something the
 
03:15:55.269 --> 03:15:55.279 align:start position:0%
legislature would have to determine it's
 
03:15:56.469 --> 03:15:56.479 align:start position:0%
not something we can determine at the
 
03:16:00.950 --> 03:16:00.960 align:start position:0%
local level okay so going back then so
 
03:16:04.309 --> 03:16:04.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:05.590 --> 03:16:05.600 align:start position:0%
so is it
 
03:16:07.110 --> 03:16:07.120 align:start position:0%
is it possible
 
03:16:07.120 --> 03:16:08.150 align:start position:0%
is it possible
that

03:16:08.150 --> 03:16:08.160 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:16:11.110 --> 03:16:11.120 align:start position:0%
am i seeing uh that this is what it's
 
03:16:11.120 --> 03:16:12.550 align:start position:0%
am i seeing uh that this is what it's
creating

03:16:12.550 --> 03:16:12.560 align:start position:0%
creating
 
03:16:16.630 --> 03:16:16.640 align:start position:0%
this bill kind of confusing as we
 
03:16:18.229 --> 03:16:18.239 align:start position:0%
have the voting
 
03:16:19.910 --> 03:16:19.920 align:start position:0%
there's a parallel universe being
 
03:16:19.920 --> 03:16:21.830 align:start position:0%
there's a parallel universe being
created

03:16:21.830 --> 03:16:21.840 align:start position:0%
created
 
03:16:23.750 --> 03:16:23.760 align:start position:0%
well i don't think the bill captures the
 
03:16:25.910 --> 03:16:25.920 align:start position:0%
intent of the the sponsor my
 
03:16:27.190 --> 03:16:27.200 align:start position:0%
understanding in speaking with the
 
03:16:30.469 --> 03:16:30.479 align:start position:0%
sponsor is that the intent was
 
03:16:30.479 --> 03:16:31.590 align:start position:0%
sponsor is that the intent was
there

03:16:31.590 --> 03:16:31.600 align:start position:0%
there
 
03:16:32.710 --> 03:16:32.720 align:start position:0%
the allegation is there are
 
03:16:34.950 --> 03:16:34.960 align:start position:0%
circumstances where someone says
 
03:16:37.190 --> 03:16:37.200 align:start position:0%
hey i know you know joe is running for
 
03:16:38.790 --> 03:16:38.800 align:start position:0%
the budget committee i don't like joe
 
03:16:41.110 --> 03:16:41.120 align:start position:0%
i'm already on it i'm going to run again
 
03:16:43.269 --> 03:16:43.279 align:start position:0%
and then i'll resign the next day after
 
03:16:44.950 --> 03:16:44.960 align:start position:0%
the election if i win and you guys can
 
03:16:47.030 --> 03:16:47.040 align:start position:0%
appoint somebody else who's not joe
 
03:16:49.030 --> 03:16:49.040 align:start position:0%
um i think that's the intent
 
03:16:49.040 --> 03:16:49.990 align:start position:0%
um i think that's the intent
um

03:16:49.990 --> 03:16:50.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:16:51.429 --> 03:16:51.439 align:start position:0%
i don't think that's captured by the
 
03:16:53.269 --> 03:16:53.279 align:start position:0%
legal language here
 
03:16:54.309 --> 03:16:54.319 align:start position:0%
i'm not
 
03:16:55.510 --> 03:16:55.520 align:start position:0%
sure i would characterize it as
 
03:16:57.830 --> 03:16:57.840 align:start position:0%
necessarily the ranked choice voting but
 
03:16:59.429 --> 03:16:59.439 align:start position:0%
presumably if
 
03:17:00.790 --> 03:17:00.800 align:start position:0%
a bunch of people in town don't agree
 
03:17:02.550 --> 03:17:02.560 align:start position:0%
with joe and they learn that the current
 
03:17:03.990 --> 03:17:04.000 align:start position:0%
budget committee member who's up for
 
03:17:04.000 --> 03:17:05.190 align:start position:0%
budget committee member who's up for
re-election

03:17:05.190 --> 03:17:05.200 align:start position:0%
re-election
 
03:17:07.830 --> 03:17:07.840 align:start position:0%
is going to resign or you know not run
 
03:17:09.910 --> 03:17:09.920 align:start position:0%
again presumably if enough people like
 
03:17:11.910 --> 03:17:11.920 align:start position:0%
them someone else will run i mean that's
 
03:17:16.710 --> 03:17:16.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:19.910 --> 03:17:19.920 align:start position:0%
any other questions from the committee
 
03:17:21.670 --> 03:17:21.680 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much thank
 
03:17:23.429 --> 03:17:23.439 align:start position:0%

that concludes the hearing on
 
03:17:40.150 --> 03:17:40.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:00.710 --> 03:18:00.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:04.389 --> 03:18:04.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:06.309 --> 03:18:06.319 align:start position:0%

03:18:30.150 --> 03:18:30.160 align:start position:0%
representative griffin would you like to

03:18:44.150 --> 03:18:44.160 align:start position:0%
committee um thank you for your
 
03:18:46.070 --> 03:18:46.080 align:start position:0%
indulgence and listening to me in
 
03:18:50.150 --> 03:18:50.160 align:start position:0%
regards to hb 1307 which was sent to
 
03:18:52.710 --> 03:18:52.720 align:start position:0%
your committee and it is an act
 
03:18:52.720 --> 03:18:54.710 align:start position:0%
your committee and it is an act
modifying

03:18:54.710 --> 03:18:54.720 align:start position:0%
modifying
 
03:18:58.790 --> 03:18:58.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:00.630 --> 03:19:00.640 align:start position:0%
this committee is
 
03:19:02.389 --> 03:19:02.399 align:start position:0%
for the most part i know very familiar
 
03:19:05.030 --> 03:19:05.040 align:start position:0%
with the housing appeals board
 
03:19:07.750 --> 03:19:07.760 align:start position:0%
and the core issue in regards to housing
 
03:19:10.469 --> 03:19:10.479 align:start position:0%
issues in all legislation before us in
 
03:19:12.469 --> 03:19:12.479 align:start position:0%
regards to these issues is a familiar
 
03:19:14.150 --> 03:19:14.160 align:start position:0%
one in many areas
 
03:19:16.070 --> 03:19:16.080 align:start position:0%
and that is the interests of the state
 
03:19:18.229 --> 03:19:18.239 align:start position:0%
as compared to the interest of our local
 
03:19:18.239 --> 03:19:20.150 align:start position:0%
as compared to the interest of our local
communities

03:19:20.150 --> 03:19:20.160 align:start position:0%
communities
 
03:19:24.070 --> 03:19:24.080 align:start position:0%
and as this bill touches on one fairly
 
03:19:25.830 --> 03:19:25.840 align:start position:0%
broad area that's in all of our
 
03:19:27.590 --> 03:19:27.600 align:start position:0%
communities zoning
 
03:19:30.630 --> 03:19:30.640 align:start position:0%
it was a very controversial proposal and
 
03:19:32.950 --> 03:19:32.960 align:start position:0%
in fact
 
03:19:32.960 --> 03:19:34.070 align:start position:0%
in fact
passed

03:19:34.070 --> 03:19:34.080 align:start position:0%
passed
 
03:19:37.269 --> 03:19:37.279 align:start position:0%
into it was 2019 legislation that became
 
03:19:40.710 --> 03:19:40.720 align:start position:0%
effective in in july july 1st 2020
 
03:19:43.110 --> 03:19:43.120 align:start position:0%
and it passed in a methodology that is
 
03:19:45.990 --> 03:19:46.000 align:start position:0%
used by both parties
 
03:19:48.550 --> 03:19:48.560 align:start position:0%
used and abused i would say in regards
 
03:19:50.630 --> 03:19:50.640 align:start position:0%
to both parties in regards to being
 
03:19:54.150 --> 03:19:54.160 align:start position:0%
attached to something else
 
03:19:56.389 --> 03:19:56.399 align:start position:0%
so we have it
 
03:19:58.469 --> 03:19:58.479 align:start position:0%
and the fact it came into existence has
 
03:20:00.630 --> 03:20:00.640 align:start position:0%
not prevented legislation
 
03:20:03.030 --> 03:20:03.040 align:start position:0%
uh being proposed in regards to it my
 
03:20:05.429 --> 03:20:05.439 align:start position:0%
bill is one of four that were proposed
 
03:20:07.510 --> 03:20:07.520 align:start position:0%
this year directly to deal with this
 
03:20:10.150 --> 03:20:10.160 align:start position:0%
issue for some reason your committee got
 
03:20:12.070 --> 03:20:12.080 align:start position:0%
one of the bills the three other ones
 
03:20:14.309 --> 03:20:14.319 align:start position:0%
went to judiciary
 
03:20:16.389 --> 03:20:16.399 align:start position:0%
the three other bills relating to the
 
03:20:18.309 --> 03:20:18.319 align:start position:0%
housing appeals for two directly one
 
03:20:21.349 --> 03:20:21.359 align:start position:0%
indirectly one proposed abolishment of
 
03:20:21.359 --> 03:20:22.630 align:start position:0%
indirectly one proposed abolishment of
it

03:20:22.630 --> 03:20:22.640 align:start position:0%
it
 
03:20:25.429 --> 03:20:25.439 align:start position:0%
one proposed significant modifications
 
03:20:27.030 --> 03:20:27.040 align:start position:0%
throughout the body of the statute
 
03:20:29.510 --> 03:20:29.520 align:start position:0%
dealing with the housing appeals board
 
03:20:33.349 --> 03:20:33.359 align:start position:0%
and one was a proposal to create a
 
03:20:36.309 --> 03:20:36.319 align:start position:0%
special court in the superior court
 
03:20:39.110 --> 03:20:39.120 align:start position:0%
system to deal with housing appeals
 
03:20:41.349 --> 03:20:41.359 align:start position:0%
those will all be coming to the floor
 
03:20:42.870 --> 03:20:42.880 align:start position:0%
with a recommendation from the committee
 
03:20:45.030 --> 03:20:45.040 align:start position:0%
of itl
 
03:20:47.030 --> 03:20:47.040 align:start position:0%
that doesn't mean that the board is not
 
03:20:50.150 --> 03:20:50.160 align:start position:0%
without controversy to this day
 
03:20:52.710 --> 03:20:52.720 align:start position:0%
and my proposal is very simple i can
 
03:20:54.950 --> 03:20:54.960 align:start position:0%
tell you there are many other parts of
 
03:20:56.790 --> 03:20:56.800 align:start position:0%
the bill in the housing appeals board
 
03:20:59.110 --> 03:20:59.120 align:start position:0%
that i disagree with and i continue to
 
03:21:00.389 --> 03:21:00.399 align:start position:0%
disagree with
 
03:21:02.229 --> 03:21:02.239 align:start position:0%
however what i have sought to do in this
 
03:21:05.110 --> 03:21:05.120 align:start position:0%
bill is to address the issue of
 
03:21:05.120 --> 03:21:07.429 align:start position:0%
bill is to address the issue of
jurisdiction

03:21:07.429 --> 03:21:07.439 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction
 
03:21:10.550 --> 03:21:10.560 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction and who can decide what is
 
03:21:12.469 --> 03:21:12.479 align:start position:0%
something that's needed both for people
 
03:21:14.950 --> 03:21:14.960 align:start position:0%
who have an issue to be decided and i
 
03:21:17.030 --> 03:21:17.040 align:start position:0%
think it's needed also for the people
 
03:21:19.429 --> 03:21:19.439 align:start position:0%
who are doing the deciding
 
03:21:21.510 --> 03:21:21.520 align:start position:0%
and that's where we get into trouble we
 
03:21:23.590 --> 03:21:23.600 align:start position:0%
have many arguments or discussions in
 
03:21:25.670 --> 03:21:25.680 align:start position:0%
this legislature over whether people are
 
03:21:27.750 --> 03:21:27.760 align:start position:0%
properly deciding things whether they
 
03:21:29.670 --> 03:21:29.680 align:start position:0%
have been given the authority to do what
 
03:21:32.950 --> 03:21:32.960 align:start position:0%
they're doing and quite honestly
 
03:21:34.870 --> 03:21:34.880 align:start position:0%
the decision-making authority
 
03:21:36.790 --> 03:21:36.800 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction authority in the statute
 
03:21:37.990 --> 03:21:38.000 align:start position:0%
that's been giving to the housing
 
03:21:42.030 --> 03:21:42.040 align:start position:0%
appeals board allows for them to decide
 
03:21:42.040 --> 03:21:43.910 align:start position:0%
appeals board allows for them to decide
anything

03:21:43.910 --> 03:21:43.920 align:start position:0%
anything
 
03:21:46.389 --> 03:21:46.399 align:start position:0%
that can in any way be related to
 
03:21:48.550 --> 03:21:48.560 align:start position:0%
housing to include
 
03:21:50.790 --> 03:21:50.800 align:start position:0%
what your municipality has decided
 
03:21:53.110 --> 03:21:53.120 align:start position:0%
permit fees should be
 
03:21:56.710 --> 03:21:56.720 align:start position:0%
whether requirements for fire and safety
 
03:22:00.710 --> 03:22:00.720 align:start position:0%
are appropriate for the plan as approved
 
03:22:02.950 --> 03:22:02.960 align:start position:0%
or whether or not a class six road
 
03:22:04.830 --> 03:22:04.840 align:start position:0%
should be developed or not
 
03:22:07.429 --> 03:22:07.439 align:start position:0%
developed and i would suggest to you
 
03:22:09.590 --> 03:22:09.600 align:start position:0%
that why proponents while proponents of
 
03:22:11.750 --> 03:22:11.760 align:start position:0%
the housing appeals board have said well
 
03:22:13.830 --> 03:22:13.840 align:start position:0%
that's exactly what it was intended to
 
03:22:15.990 --> 03:22:16.000 align:start position:0%
do it was proposed to be all
 
03:22:16.000 --> 03:22:17.910 align:start position:0%
do it was proposed to be all
encompassing

03:22:17.910 --> 03:22:17.920 align:start position:0%
encompassing
 
03:22:19.590 --> 03:22:19.600 align:start position:0%
what i heard and what i think most
 
03:22:21.590 --> 03:22:21.600 align:start position:0%
people heard was that developers were
 
03:22:23.590 --> 03:22:23.600 align:start position:0%
complaining that your local boards who
 
03:22:25.510 --> 03:22:25.520 align:start position:0%
are elected you just got to talk about
 
03:22:27.349 --> 03:22:27.359 align:start position:0%
elections most of whom are elected
 
03:22:29.030 --> 03:22:29.040 align:start position:0%
conservation commissions are not elected
 
03:22:30.469 --> 03:22:30.479 align:start position:0%
they're appointed but they have certain
 
03:22:32.950 --> 03:22:32.960 align:start position:0%
decision-making authority
 
03:22:35.269 --> 03:22:35.279 align:start position:0%
that they're abusing their discretion
 
03:22:36.710 --> 03:22:36.720 align:start position:0%
they're making decisions that are
 
03:22:38.790 --> 03:22:38.800 align:start position:0%
improper they're taking too long they're
 
03:22:41.110 --> 03:22:41.120 align:start position:0%
holding up our our decision-making we
 
03:22:42.870 --> 03:22:42.880 align:start position:0%
need another avenue
 
03:22:44.710 --> 03:22:44.720 align:start position:0%
when we have a dispute with what your
 
03:22:47.110 --> 03:22:47.120 align:start position:0%
board did again you will hear
 
03:22:49.110 --> 03:22:49.120 align:start position:0%
that's not what we said we said it would
 
03:22:51.349 --> 03:22:51.359 align:start position:0%
be anything
 
03:22:52.870 --> 03:22:52.880 align:start position:0%
we all know there's a difference between
 
03:22:55.030 --> 03:22:55.040 align:start position:0%
what is said and what is heard and if
 
03:22:57.030 --> 03:22:57.040 align:start position:0%
they said that i didn't hear it
 
03:22:59.990 --> 03:23:00.000 align:start position:0%
and my apologies to them but it is my
 
03:23:02.070 --> 03:23:02.080 align:start position:0%
opinion of being a local elected
 
03:23:04.790 --> 03:23:04.800 align:start position:0%
official for over 30 years that that is
 
03:23:07.030 --> 03:23:07.040 align:start position:0%
what the appropriate jurisdiction for
 
03:23:09.990 --> 03:23:10.000 align:start position:0%
this board should be as it is designed
 
03:23:13.670 --> 03:23:13.680 align:start position:0%
and as it was represented so all my bill
 
03:23:15.349 --> 03:23:15.359 align:start position:0%
proposes to do
 
03:23:20.150 --> 03:23:20.160 align:start position:0%
is to modify the proposed language
 
03:23:22.870 --> 03:23:22.880 align:start position:0%
to make it clear that decisions that it
 
03:23:24.070 --> 03:23:24.080 align:start position:0%
will hear
 
03:23:26.389 --> 03:23:26.399 align:start position:0%
are from planning boards zba's building
 
03:23:28.070 --> 03:23:28.080 align:start position:0%
code of appeals historic district
 
03:23:29.750 --> 03:23:29.760 align:start position:0%
commissions heritage commissions and
 
03:23:31.269 --> 03:23:31.279 align:start position:0%
applications for the development of
 
03:23:31.279 --> 03:23:33.750 align:start position:0%
applications for the development of
housing

03:23:33.750 --> 03:23:33.760 align:start position:0%
housing
 
03:23:33.760 --> 03:23:35.510 align:start position:0%
housing
so

03:23:35.510 --> 03:23:35.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:23:37.510 --> 03:23:37.520 align:start position:0%
certain regulations
 
03:23:37.520 --> 03:23:40.150 align:start position:0%
certain regulations
ordinances

03:23:40.150 --> 03:23:40.160 align:start position:0%
ordinances
 
03:23:40.160 --> 03:23:41.429 align:start position:0%
ordinances
or

03:23:41.429 --> 03:23:41.439 align:start position:0%
or
 
03:23:44.469 --> 03:23:44.479 align:start position:0%
anything else because it's not limited
 
03:23:47.670 --> 03:23:47.680 align:start position:0%
to the list that's currently there
 
03:23:53.429 --> 03:23:53.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:53.439 --> 03:23:54.389 align:start position:0%
 
now

03:23:54.389 --> 03:23:54.399 align:start position:0%
now
 
03:23:58.469 --> 03:23:58.479 align:start position:0%
the board has been in place since 2020
 
03:23:59.990 --> 03:24:00.000 align:start position:0%
you can go on their website and the
 
03:24:02.070 --> 03:24:02.080 align:start position:0%
decisions are published which is a great
 
03:24:03.510 --> 03:24:03.520 align:start position:0%
thing when they first started they were
 
03:24:04.870 --> 03:24:04.880 align:start position:0%
not publishing their decisions
 
03:24:06.469 --> 03:24:06.479 align:start position:0%
apparently there was some controversy
 
03:24:07.990 --> 03:24:08.000 align:start position:0%
but they're up there
 
03:24:10.150 --> 03:24:10.160 align:start position:0%
i can tell you goffstown has one pending
 
03:24:12.070 --> 03:24:12.080 align:start position:0%
guy i am a representative from goffstown
 
03:24:14.070 --> 03:24:14.080 align:start position:0%
my apologies i didn't actually introduce
 
03:24:14.080 --> 03:24:15.190 align:start position:0%
my apologies i didn't actually introduce
myself

03:24:15.190 --> 03:24:15.200 align:start position:0%
myself
 
03:24:17.830 --> 03:24:17.840 align:start position:0%
i'm barbara griffin from goffstown um we
 
03:24:20.389 --> 03:24:20.399 align:start position:0%
had a zba decision appeal that was
 
03:24:22.790 --> 03:24:22.800 align:start position:0%
affirmed and we had a zba decision that
 
03:24:24.550 --> 03:24:24.560 align:start position:0%
was not affirmed and has been remanded
 
03:24:26.469 --> 03:24:26.479 align:start position:0%
for further hearing
 
03:24:28.229 --> 03:24:28.239 align:start position:0%
i would say a review of the decision of
 
03:24:30.070 --> 03:24:30.080 align:start position:0%
the housing appeals board indicates that
 
03:24:32.630 --> 03:24:32.640 align:start position:0%
when it's a smaller application or an
 
03:24:34.950 --> 03:24:34.960 align:start position:0%
individual application they sort of are
 
03:24:36.790 --> 03:24:36.800 align:start position:0%
tending to uphold the decision of the
 
03:24:41.110 --> 03:24:41.120 align:start position:0%
local board or deciding board
 
03:24:42.870 --> 03:24:42.880 align:start position:0%
that when it they tend to be bigger
 
03:24:46.150 --> 03:24:46.160 align:start position:0%
applications they tend to overturn
 
03:24:47.750 --> 03:24:47.760 align:start position:0%
or find something improper in the
 
03:24:49.750 --> 03:24:49.760 align:start position:0%
decision of the community and remand it
 
03:24:51.510 --> 03:24:51.520 align:start position:0%
back for further decision
 
03:24:55.110 --> 03:24:55.120 align:start position:0%
or reverse it entirely depending it so
 
03:24:57.349 --> 03:24:57.359 align:start position:0%
you will hear some people say hey there
 
03:24:59.349 --> 03:24:59.359 align:start position:0%
really haven't been that many complaints
 
03:25:02.389 --> 03:25:02.399 align:start position:0%
we've had 15 plus decisions it's going
 
03:25:04.150 --> 03:25:04.160 align:start position:0%
pretty well why would we want to change
 
03:25:06.710 --> 03:25:06.720 align:start position:0%
it let's have a study commission in a
 
03:25:08.389 --> 03:25:08.399 align:start position:0%
few years
 
03:25:10.389 --> 03:25:10.399 align:start position:0%
to look at all the decisions and decide
 
03:25:13.510 --> 03:25:13.520 align:start position:0%
if we need to cut it back
 
03:25:15.510 --> 03:25:15.520 align:start position:0%
i will tell you this is my eighth year
 
03:25:17.269 --> 03:25:17.279 align:start position:0%
in the legislature and as i said i've
 
03:25:19.269 --> 03:25:19.279 align:start position:0%
been on municipal boards for many years
 
03:25:22.309 --> 03:25:22.319 align:start position:0%
it is much harder to cut things back
 
03:25:24.229 --> 03:25:24.239 align:start position:0%
than it is to expand them
 
03:25:26.550 --> 03:25:26.560 align:start position:0%
it is much easier to make a board work
 
03:25:28.469 --> 03:25:28.479 align:start position:0%
appropriately when the jurisdiction is
 
03:25:30.870 --> 03:25:30.880 align:start position:0%
clear and there's no question about
 
03:25:32.229 --> 03:25:32.239 align:start position:0%
whether or not it should be hearing
 
03:25:32.239 --> 03:25:33.910 align:start position:0%
whether or not it should be hearing
something

03:25:33.910 --> 03:25:33.920 align:start position:0%
something
 
03:25:36.229 --> 03:25:36.239 align:start position:0%
than it is to get into arguments about
 
03:25:38.630 --> 03:25:38.640 align:start position:0%
whether or not a a particular issue
 
03:25:40.229 --> 03:25:40.239 align:start position:0%
should have even been before them in the
 
03:25:42.309 --> 03:25:42.319 align:start position:0%
first place
 
03:25:42.319 --> 03:25:43.349 align:start position:0%
first place
so

03:25:43.349 --> 03:25:43.359 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:25:46.309 --> 03:25:46.319 align:start position:0%
that's all my bill is trying to do
 
03:25:49.429 --> 03:25:49.439 align:start position:0%
um it's to clearly define
 
03:25:51.830 --> 03:25:51.840 align:start position:0%
the basis of an appeal to the housing
 
03:25:53.910 --> 03:25:53.920 align:start position:0%
appeals board which is an unelected
 
03:25:57.030 --> 03:25:57.040 align:start position:0%
board overseeing decisions of your
 
03:25:59.030 --> 03:25:59.040 align:start position:0%
elected community members
 
03:26:01.830 --> 03:26:01.840 align:start position:0%
overseeing decisions related to your
 
03:26:04.389 --> 03:26:04.399 align:start position:0%
communities adopted by vote zoning
 
03:26:04.399 --> 03:26:06.790 align:start position:0%
communities adopted by vote zoning
regulations

03:26:06.790 --> 03:26:06.800 align:start position:0%
regulations
 
03:26:08.550 --> 03:26:08.560 align:start position:0%
i'm not trying to get rid of it i'm not
 
03:26:11.349 --> 03:26:11.359 align:start position:0%
setting up a new court it is here i have
 
03:26:13.510 --> 03:26:13.520 align:start position:0%
resigned myself to it even though i
 
03:26:15.510 --> 03:26:15.520 align:start position:0%
don't particularly like it i think the
 
03:26:17.910 --> 03:26:17.920 align:start position:0%
legislature should be much more honest
 
03:26:20.870 --> 03:26:20.880 align:start position:0%
and abolish local zoning and enact state
 
03:26:23.349 --> 03:26:23.359 align:start position:0%
zoning and wouldn't that be fun in your
 
03:26:23.359 --> 03:26:25.030 align:start position:0%
zoning and wouldn't that be fun in your
communities

03:26:25.030 --> 03:26:25.040 align:start position:0%
communities
 
03:26:27.750 --> 03:26:27.760 align:start position:0%
because that's sort of what we're aiming
 
03:26:27.760 --> 03:26:29.510 align:start position:0%
because that's sort of what we're aiming
for

03:26:29.510 --> 03:26:29.520 align:start position:0%
for
 
03:26:31.510 --> 03:26:31.520 align:start position:0%
but that's a discussion
 
03:26:34.150 --> 03:26:34.160 align:start position:0%
for the cafeteria not here
 
03:26:37.590 --> 03:26:37.600 align:start position:0%
so um i re i request your support
 
03:26:39.910 --> 03:26:39.920 align:start position:0%
in regards to this bill i think it is a
 
03:26:42.150 --> 03:26:42.160 align:start position:0%
reasonable clarification of the current
 
03:26:43.990 --> 03:26:44.000 align:start position:0%
statute that's consistent with the
 
03:26:46.389 --> 03:26:46.399 align:start position:0%
majority of decisions and i believe you
 
03:26:48.550 --> 03:26:48.560 align:start position:0%
will hear that there is dispute as to
 
03:26:50.150 --> 03:26:50.160 align:start position:0%
whether or not something they heard was
 
03:26:50.160 --> 03:26:51.670 align:start position:0%
whether or not something they heard was
appropriate

03:26:51.670 --> 03:26:51.680 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
03:26:55.110 --> 03:26:55.120 align:start position:0%
and requests that you recommend
 
03:26:57.030 --> 03:26:57.040 align:start position:0%
and i'd be happy to take any questions
 
03:26:58.830 --> 03:26:58.840 align:start position:0%

taking my question
 
03:27:45.349 --> 03:27:45.359 align:start position:0%
so i i wanted
 
03:27:45.359 --> 03:27:46.710 align:start position:0%
so i i wanted
to

03:27:46.710 --> 03:27:46.720 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:27:50.229 --> 03:27:50.239 align:start position:0%
understand and make clear that on line
 
03:27:50.239 --> 03:27:51.590 align:start position:0%
understand and make clear that on line
15

03:27:51.590 --> 03:27:51.600 align:start position:0%
15
 
03:27:53.790 --> 03:27:53.800 align:start position:0%
it says that
 
03:27:53.800 --> 03:27:55.590 align:start position:0%
it says that
applications

03:27:55.590 --> 03:27:55.600 align:start position:0%
applications
 
03:27:58.070 --> 03:27:58.080 align:start position:0%
for the development of housing
 
03:28:02.550 --> 03:28:02.560 align:start position:0%
so is it's a prerequisite then that
 
03:28:02.560 --> 03:28:03.510 align:start position:0%
so is it's a prerequisite then that
the

03:28:03.510 --> 03:28:03.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:28:06.309 --> 03:28:06.319 align:start position:0%
party must have
 
03:28:09.670 --> 03:28:09.680 align:start position:0%
actually applied and have a bonafide
 
03:28:09.680 --> 03:28:11.190 align:start position:0%
actually applied and have a bonafide
application

03:28:11.190 --> 03:28:11.200 align:start position:0%
application
 
03:28:12.550 --> 03:28:12.560 align:start position:0%
and that
 
03:28:15.510 --> 03:28:15.520 align:start position:0%
the the party appealing to the housing
 
03:28:18.309 --> 03:28:18.319 align:start position:0%
board housing appeals board is not
 
03:28:21.269 --> 03:28:21.279 align:start position:0%
simply thinking about
 
03:28:23.110 --> 03:28:23.120 align:start position:0%
filing an application and the reason i
 
03:28:24.870 --> 03:28:24.880 align:start position:0%
ask this is because
 
03:28:27.590 --> 03:28:27.600 align:start position:0%
currently in brookline a developer has
 
03:28:33.110 --> 03:28:33.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:35.750 --> 03:28:35.760 align:start position:0%
with a grievance about the town of
 
03:28:38.309 --> 03:28:38.319 align:start position:0%
brookline using an innovative land use
 
03:28:40.389 --> 03:28:40.399 align:start position:0%
control which is
 
03:28:42.870 --> 03:28:42.880 align:start position:0%
permissible under statute and they have
 
03:28:46.070 --> 03:28:46.080 align:start position:0%
not actually filed an application
 
03:28:47.910 --> 03:28:47.920 align:start position:0%
they're just thinking about it they were
 
03:28:50.550 --> 03:28:50.560 align:start position:0%
exploring it so could you make clear
 
03:28:50.560 --> 03:28:51.510 align:start position:0%
exploring it so could you make clear
that

03:28:51.510 --> 03:28:51.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:28:53.990 --> 03:28:54.000 align:start position:0%
under the amended language
 
03:28:54.000 --> 03:28:54.790 align:start position:0%
under the amended language
that

03:28:54.790 --> 03:28:54.800 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:28:56.070 --> 03:28:56.080 align:start position:0%
the party
 
03:28:58.630 --> 03:28:58.640 align:start position:0%
appealing to the housing appeals board
 
03:29:00.389 --> 03:29:00.399 align:start position:0%
must be in fact
 
03:29:03.110 --> 03:29:03.120 align:start position:0%
a bona fide applicant thank you
 
03:29:04.710 --> 03:29:04.720 align:start position:0%
representative and yes i will confirm
 
03:29:05.990 --> 03:29:06.000 align:start position:0%
that and i think that's a perfect
 
03:29:08.710 --> 03:29:08.720 align:start position:0%
example of why this bill is needed an
 
03:29:11.670 --> 03:29:11.680 align:start position:0%
innovative land use control
 
03:29:13.429 --> 03:29:13.439 align:start position:0%
is something very different than an
 
03:29:15.349 --> 03:29:15.359 align:start position:0%
application that is before a board to
 
03:29:15.359 --> 03:29:16.469 align:start position:0%
application that is before a board to
address

03:29:16.469 --> 03:29:16.479 align:start position:0%
address
 
03:29:18.790 --> 03:29:18.800 align:start position:0%
and as a representative just indicated
 
03:29:21.750 --> 03:29:21.760 align:start position:0%
they chose to go to this the superior
 
03:29:23.830 --> 03:29:23.840 align:start position:0%
court to the court of equity
 
03:29:26.229 --> 03:29:26.239 align:start position:0%
which i would suggest is where the
 
03:29:29.110 --> 03:29:29.120 align:start position:0%
person is that should be deciding that
 
03:29:30.550 --> 03:29:30.560 align:start position:0%
type of a thing
 
03:29:33.670 --> 03:29:33.680 align:start position:0%
as compared to whether a community
 
03:29:36.309 --> 03:29:36.319 align:start position:0%
applied its standards
 
03:29:39.110 --> 03:29:39.120 align:start position:0%
appropriately or whether those standards
 
03:29:41.510 --> 03:29:41.520 align:start position:0%
were proper in connection with the
 
03:29:48.710 --> 03:29:48.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:52.309 --> 03:29:52.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:54.710 --> 03:29:54.720 align:start position:0%
does for example a developer do they
 
03:29:58.309 --> 03:29:58.319 align:start position:0%
have standing to to either go to the
 
03:30:01.670 --> 03:30:01.680 align:start position:0%
housing appeals board or the superior
 
03:30:05.349 --> 03:30:05.359 align:start position:0%
court if in fact they have not filed
 
03:30:06.950 --> 03:30:06.960 align:start position:0%
an application
 
03:30:09.030 --> 03:30:09.040 align:start position:0%
that they're trying to appeal i would
 
03:30:10.870 --> 03:30:10.880 align:start position:0%
argue under the current language of the
 
03:30:13.750 --> 03:30:13.760 align:start position:0%
housing appeals board they would be able
 
03:30:15.349 --> 03:30:15.359 align:start position:0%
to um
 
03:30:18.150 --> 03:30:18.160 align:start position:0%
i think people might differ
 
03:30:19.830 --> 03:30:19.840 align:start position:0%
your particular example they have
 
03:30:21.830 --> 03:30:21.840 align:start position:0%
clearly chosen to go to superior court
 
03:30:24.070 --> 03:30:24.080 align:start position:0%
and my change would not prohibit them
 
03:30:25.990 --> 03:30:26.000 align:start position:0%
from doing that
 
03:30:28.870 --> 03:30:28.880 align:start position:0%
there there is just no way to avoid that
 
03:30:30.630 --> 03:30:30.640 align:start position:0%
disputes occur and sometimes they're
 
03:30:32.229 --> 03:30:32.239 align:start position:0%
going to end up in court depending what
 
03:30:34.309 --> 03:30:34.319 align:start position:0%
the interests of the parties are and i
 
03:30:36.389 --> 03:30:36.399 align:start position:0%
think the housing appeals board was
 
03:30:37.830 --> 03:30:37.840 align:start position:0%
intended to
 
03:30:40.469 --> 03:30:40.479 align:start position:0%
expedite resolution of issues related to
 
03:30:42.950 --> 03:30:42.960 align:start position:0%
the actual development of housing not
 
03:30:44.950 --> 03:30:44.960 align:start position:0%
deal with questions as to whether or not
 
03:30:46.710 --> 03:30:46.720 align:start position:0%
something was appropriately adopted
 
03:30:49.510 --> 03:30:49.520 align:start position:0%
which belong in the equity court of the
 
03:30:54.150 --> 03:30:54.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:55.190 --> 03:30:55.200 align:start position:0%
all right
 
03:31:00.950 --> 03:31:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:02.550 --> 03:31:02.560 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you mr chair
 
03:31:07.269 --> 03:31:07.279 align:start position:0%

a copy of one of the decisions rendered
 
03:31:50.550 --> 03:31:50.560 align:start position:0%
by the housing appeals board that would
 
03:31:52.870 --> 03:31:52.880 align:start position:0%
not have been possible
 
03:31:54.710 --> 03:31:54.720 align:start position:0%
had not

03:32:09.750 --> 03:32:09.760 align:start position:0%
housing appeal board has received a lot
 
03:32:13.910 --> 03:32:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:17.990 --> 03:32:18.000 align:start position:0%
and senate passed senate bill 557
 
03:32:20.710 --> 03:32:20.720 align:start position:0%
on march 15th of 2018.
 
03:32:23.190 --> 03:32:23.200 align:start position:0%
that's almost four years ago
 
03:32:24.790 --> 03:32:24.800 align:start position:0%
the house recommended a bill for interim
 
03:32:24.800 --> 03:32:25.990 align:start position:0%

on a vote of 20 to two out of the

on a vote of 20 to two out of the
committee

03:32:32.229 --> 03:32:32.239 align:start position:0%
committee
 
03:32:35.030 --> 03:32:35.040 align:start position:0%
number of senators reintroduced the bill
 
03:32:37.590 --> 03:32:37.600 align:start position:0%
in the 2019 session
 
03:32:39.590 --> 03:32:39.600 align:start position:0%
we did this because
 
03:32:41.910 --> 03:32:41.920 align:start position:0%
as you must be aware
 
03:32:44.309 --> 03:32:44.319 align:start position:0%
we are in a desperate housing shortage
 
03:32:45.990 --> 03:32:46.000 align:start position:0%
in our state desperate is the
 
03:32:47.830 --> 03:32:47.840 align:start position:0%
appropriate word
 
03:32:48.790 --> 03:32:48.800 align:start position:0%
we are
 
03:32:50.870 --> 03:32:50.880 align:start position:0%
tens of thousands of housing units short
 
03:32:53.349 --> 03:32:53.359 align:start position:0%
of what's needed
 
03:32:53.359 --> 03:32:55.830 align:start position:0%
of what's needed
and

03:32:55.830 --> 03:32:55.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:58.630 --> 03:32:58.640 align:start position:0%
this not only affects
 
03:33:00.630 --> 03:33:00.640 align:start position:0%
working families this also affects
 
03:33:02.309 --> 03:33:02.319 align:start position:0%
homeless think about that there's no
 
03:33:03.750 --> 03:33:03.760 align:start position:0%
housing available for working families
 
03:33:05.030 --> 03:33:05.040 align:start position:0%
there's certainly no housing available
 
03:33:06.150 --> 03:33:06.160 align:start position:0%
for the homeless
 
03:33:08.550 --> 03:33:08.560 align:start position:0%
so it exacerbates a problem
 
03:33:11.750 --> 03:33:11.760 align:start position:0%
that we face every day as well
 
03:33:13.269 --> 03:33:13.279 align:start position:0%
the house version of the housing appeals
 
03:33:14.950 --> 03:33:14.960 align:start position:0%
board was introduced by representative
 
03:33:16.150 --> 03:33:16.160 align:start position:0%
lynn ober
 
03:33:18.790 --> 03:33:18.800 align:start position:0%
through house bill 104 they urged
 
03:33:20.389 --> 03:33:20.399 align:start position:0%
support for the senate version instead
 
03:33:22.630 --> 03:33:22.640 align:start position:0%
of the house version
 
03:33:24.790 --> 03:33:24.800 align:start position:0%
the bill was itled
 
03:33:27.510 --> 03:33:27.520 align:start position:0%
on a voice vote
 
03:33:28.950 --> 03:33:28.960 align:start position:0%
the senate election law municipal
 
03:33:30.309 --> 03:33:30.319 align:start position:0%
affairs committee recommended that
 
03:33:32.710 --> 03:33:32.720 align:start position:0%
senate bill 306 ought to pass
 
03:33:33.910 --> 03:33:33.920 align:start position:0%
it was then heard by the finance
 
03:33:35.269 --> 03:33:35.279 align:start position:0%
committee and received an ought to pass
 
03:33:37.670 --> 03:33:37.680 align:start position:0%
command recommendation six to zero in
 
03:33:39.269 --> 03:33:39.279 align:start position:0%
the senate
 
03:33:41.190 --> 03:33:41.200 align:start position:0%
we passed it on a roll call vote of 18
 
03:33:42.870 --> 03:33:42.880 align:start position:0%
to five in the senate
 
03:33:44.710 --> 03:33:44.720 align:start position:0%
and senator dallas andrew then chair of
 
03:33:46.229 --> 03:33:46.239 align:start position:0%
the finance committee requested it be
 
03:33:48.550 --> 03:33:48.560 align:start position:0%
tabled and addressed within the budget
 
03:33:50.630 --> 03:33:50.640 align:start position:0%
despite my vigorous protestations to the
 
03:33:52.150 --> 03:33:52.160 align:start position:0%
contrary because i believe that the bill
 
03:33:54.790 --> 03:33:54.800 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be used as a political tool
 
03:33:57.349 --> 03:33:57.359 align:start position:0%
to effectuate political outcomes this
 
03:34:01.910 --> 03:34:01.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:03.269 --> 03:34:03.279 align:start position:0%
the language from that bill was then
 
03:34:05.590 --> 03:34:05.600 align:start position:0%
included in house bill 2
 
03:34:07.269 --> 03:34:07.279 align:start position:0%
which after the governor's veto then
 
03:34:11.269 --> 03:34:11.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:12.790 --> 03:34:12.800 align:start position:0%
the appeals board was discussed during
 
03:34:14.469 --> 03:34:14.479 align:start position:0%
the committee of conference for the
 
03:34:16.550 --> 03:34:16.560 align:start position:0%
fiscal 20-21 budget
 
03:34:19.590 --> 03:34:19.600 align:start position:0%
conferees agreed to the request
 
03:34:22.790 --> 03:34:22.800 align:start position:0%
and we moved forward to 21.
 
03:34:25.670 --> 03:34:25.680 align:start position:0%
the appropriation of 415 000 is included
 
03:34:27.429 --> 03:34:27.439 align:start position:0%
in the final version there had been an
 
03:34:29.110 --> 03:34:29.120 align:start position:0%
attempt to cut the finding to disable
 
03:34:31.349 --> 03:34:31.359 align:start position:0%
completely the board
 
03:34:33.830 --> 03:34:33.840 align:start position:0%
now the reason for the protest and the
 
03:34:35.990 --> 03:34:36.000 align:start position:0%
the uprising frankly amongst planning
 
03:34:38.150 --> 03:34:38.160 align:start position:0%
and zoning boards
 
03:34:40.309 --> 03:34:40.319 align:start position:0%
is that for decades
 
03:34:43.190 --> 03:34:43.200 align:start position:0%
they have been unsupervised
 
03:34:45.429 --> 03:34:45.439 align:start position:0%
and for decades they have been violating
 
03:34:47.190 --> 03:34:47.200 align:start position:0%
state statutes their own local
 
03:34:49.030 --> 03:34:49.040 align:start position:0%
ordinances as well
 
03:34:51.590 --> 03:34:51.600 align:start position:0%
if you review and i i gave you in the
 
03:34:53.670 --> 03:34:53.680 align:start position:0%
email i sent to you the links to the
 
03:34:56.389 --> 03:34:56.399 align:start position:0%
housing appeals board website
 
03:34:58.790 --> 03:34:58.800 align:start position:0%
they have so far delivered
 
03:35:01.990 --> 03:35:02.000 align:start position:0%
rulings on 15 projects that were brought
 
03:35:03.910 --> 03:35:03.920 align:start position:0%
and appealed
 
03:35:06.469 --> 03:35:06.479 align:start position:0%
expedited i might add not taking a year
 
03:35:10.309 --> 03:35:10.319 align:start position:0%
or two or three but within 180 days
 
03:35:13.670 --> 03:35:13.680 align:start position:0%
in 13 of those 15 appeals
 
03:35:15.670 --> 03:35:15.680 align:start position:0%
the towns were found to have violated
 
03:35:17.750 --> 03:35:17.760 align:start position:0%
state statutes
 
03:35:19.990 --> 03:35:20.000 align:start position:0%
violated their own ordinances
 
03:35:22.630 --> 03:35:22.640 align:start position:0%
or simply made it up as he went along
 
03:35:25.030 --> 03:35:25.040 align:start position:0%
because as you know for a body to act it
 
03:35:26.630 --> 03:35:26.640 align:start position:0%
needs to be authorized to act by
 
03:35:28.229 --> 03:35:28.239 align:start position:0%
ordinance and the town did not pass
 
03:35:29.670 --> 03:35:29.680 align:start position:0%
ordinances allowing them to make the
 
03:35:31.990 --> 03:35:32.000 align:start position:0%
decisions they did
 
03:35:34.150 --> 03:35:34.160 align:start position:0%
i will not ascribe motives that's not
 
03:35:34.160 --> 03:35:35.349 align:start position:0%
i will not ascribe motives that's not
productive

03:35:35.349 --> 03:35:35.359 align:start position:0%
productive
 
03:35:37.830 --> 03:35:37.840 align:start position:0%
but we have a definite problem
 
03:35:40.469 --> 03:35:40.479 align:start position:0%
when a developer or an individual has to
 
03:35:42.469 --> 03:35:42.479 align:start position:0%
go to superior court
 
03:35:43.750 --> 03:35:43.760 align:start position:0%
and waste
 
03:35:45.830 --> 03:35:45.840 align:start position:0%
thousands sometimes tens of thousands
 
03:35:47.590 --> 03:35:47.600 align:start position:0%
sometimes hundreds of thousands of
 
03:35:47.600 --> 03:35:48.870 align:start position:0%
sometimes hundreds of thousands of
dollars

03:35:48.870 --> 03:35:48.880 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
03:35:51.750 --> 03:35:51.760 align:start position:0%
and what de facto then becomes
 
03:35:53.510 --> 03:35:53.520 align:start position:0%
the end of the project because investors
 
03:35:55.190 --> 03:35:55.200 align:start position:0%
don't want to spend money on lawyers
 
03:35:56.150 --> 03:35:56.160 align:start position:0%
they or
 
03:35:58.150 --> 03:35:58.160 align:start position:0%
on court costs and they can't afford to
 
03:35:59.510 --> 03:35:59.520 align:start position:0%
wait two or three years for court
 
03:35:59.520 --> 03:36:00.950 align:start position:0%
wait two or three years for court
decision

03:36:00.950 --> 03:36:00.960 align:start position:0%
decision
 
03:36:03.030 --> 03:36:03.040 align:start position:0%
okay they want to return on investment
 
03:36:05.030 --> 03:36:05.040 align:start position:0%
and we need those investments to house
 
03:36:06.469 --> 03:36:06.479 align:start position:0%
the population of the people of the
 
03:36:08.790 --> 03:36:08.800 align:start position:0%
state when you talk to the bea you talk
 
03:36:10.870 --> 03:36:10.880 align:start position:0%
to taylor caswell commissioner caswell
 
03:36:12.790 --> 03:36:12.800 align:start position:0%
he'll tell you that time after time we
 
03:36:14.550 --> 03:36:14.560 align:start position:0%
have businesses coming to new hampshire
 
03:36:17.190 --> 03:36:17.200 align:start position:0%
wanting to work in our great environment
 
03:36:18.630 --> 03:36:18.640 align:start position:0%
and they don't come here because we
 
03:36:21.349 --> 03:36:21.359 align:start position:0%
don't have housing
 
03:36:23.429 --> 03:36:23.439 align:start position:0%
this bill attempts to remedy the
 
03:36:23.439 --> 03:36:24.950 align:start position:0%
this bill attempts to remedy the
timeliness

03:36:24.950 --> 03:36:24.960 align:start position:0%
timeliness
 
03:36:27.349 --> 03:36:27.359 align:start position:0%
it saves towns money instead of having
 
03:36:29.190 --> 03:36:29.200 align:start position:0%
to go to court and hire lawyers you can
 
03:36:31.910 --> 03:36:31.920 align:start position:0%
represent yourselves pro se
 
03:36:33.990 --> 03:36:34.000 align:start position:0%
and it gets you a decision expeditiously
 
03:36:35.750 --> 03:36:35.760 align:start position:0%
on an issue when you read these
 
03:36:38.309 --> 03:36:38.319 align:start position:0%
decisions from the housing appeals board
 
03:36:40.950 --> 03:36:40.960 align:start position:0%
you will see that they reference
 
03:36:42.790 --> 03:36:42.800 align:start position:0%
state statutes
 
03:36:44.150 --> 03:36:44.160 align:start position:0%
zoning board and planning board
 
03:36:46.070 --> 03:36:46.080 align:start position:0%
ordinances that have been passed and
 
03:36:46.080 --> 03:36:46.830 align:start position:0%
ordinances that have been passed and
they

03:36:46.830 --> 03:36:46.840 align:start position:0%
they
 
03:36:49.190 --> 03:36:49.200 align:start position:0%
articulate the violations they support
 
03:36:50.630 --> 03:36:50.640 align:start position:0%
it with case law
 
03:36:52.790 --> 03:36:52.800 align:start position:0%
okay these are carefully thought through
 
03:36:53.990 --> 03:36:54.000 align:start position:0%
let's talk about the members of the
 
03:36:55.269 --> 03:36:55.279 align:start position:0%
board for a second they're appointed by
 
03:36:56.630 --> 03:36:56.640 align:start position:0%
the supreme court
 
03:36:56.640 --> 03:36:57.670 align:start position:0%
the supreme court
okay

03:36:57.670 --> 03:36:57.680 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:36:59.429 --> 03:36:59.439 align:start position:0%
some might go wow well the supreme court
 
03:37:00.870 --> 03:37:00.880 align:start position:0%
also appoints members of the bureau of
 
03:37:02.630 --> 03:37:02.640 align:start position:0%
tax and land appeals
 
03:37:04.550 --> 03:37:04.560 align:start position:0%
that was the agency that we modeled this
 
03:37:06.469 --> 03:37:06.479 align:start position:0%
legislation after it's very effective
 
03:37:08.870 --> 03:37:08.880 align:start position:0%
gets the job done it takes a citizen
 
03:37:10.550 --> 03:37:10.560 align:start position:0%
doesn't have to go to court but still
 
03:37:12.150 --> 03:37:12.160 align:start position:0%
can after the fact
 
03:37:14.550 --> 03:37:14.560 align:start position:0%
as in our bill you have two channels if
 
03:37:16.070 --> 03:37:16.080 align:start position:0%
you get to the end of the road with your
 
03:37:17.910 --> 03:37:17.920 align:start position:0%
local land use boards you can either go
 
03:37:20.469 --> 03:37:20.479 align:start position:0%
to superior court or you can go to the
 
03:37:22.229 --> 03:37:22.239 align:start position:0%
housing appeals board
 
03:37:23.750 --> 03:37:23.760 align:start position:0%
if you go to the housing appeals board
 
03:37:25.510 --> 03:37:25.520 align:start position:0%
you don't like the outcome and oh by the
 
03:37:27.830 --> 03:37:27.840 align:start position:0%
way abutters can do it as well
 
03:37:29.830 --> 03:37:29.840 align:start position:0%
and oh by the way they have to use the
 
03:37:32.229 --> 03:37:32.239 align:start position:0%
same process the same rules
 
03:37:34.790 --> 03:37:34.800 align:start position:0%
as a superior court okay
 
03:37:37.030 --> 03:37:37.040 align:start position:0%
and so
 
03:37:38.150 --> 03:37:38.160 align:start position:0%
you get to the end of the road and you
 
03:37:39.510 --> 03:37:39.520 align:start position:0%
don't like the outcome you can appeal to
 
03:37:41.670 --> 03:37:41.680 align:start position:0%
the supreme court
 
03:37:43.110 --> 03:37:43.120 align:start position:0%
now the supreme court doesn't have to
 
03:37:45.349 --> 03:37:45.359 align:start position:0%
take your case
 
03:37:46.790 --> 03:37:46.800 align:start position:0%
but i would submit to you that since
 
03:37:48.950 --> 03:37:48.960 align:start position:0%
it's the supreme court that offers i'm
 
03:37:50.630 --> 03:37:50.640 align:start position:0%
sorry that that appoints the members of
 
03:37:52.150 --> 03:37:52.160 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
03:37:55.670 --> 03:37:55.680 align:start position:0%
subject to approval okay
 
03:37:57.349 --> 03:37:57.359 align:start position:0%
they would probably understand that the
 
03:37:58.790 --> 03:37:58.800 align:start position:0%
members that they appointed had made
 
03:37:58.800 --> 03:38:00.150 align:start position:0%
members that they appointed had made
decisions

03:38:00.150 --> 03:38:00.160 align:start position:0%
decisions
 
03:38:02.469 --> 03:38:02.479 align:start position:0%
okay and they'll look at this before
 
03:38:05.349 --> 03:38:05.359 align:start position:0%
they decide not to to accept the case
 
03:38:07.750 --> 03:38:07.760 align:start position:0%
but we've we've laid the path so that we
 
03:38:09.910 --> 03:38:09.920 align:start position:0%
have an expeditious less costly appeal
 
03:38:11.429 --> 03:38:11.439 align:start position:0%
through the housing appeals board that
 
03:38:11.439 --> 03:38:12.710 align:start position:0%
through the housing appeals board that
nonetheless

03:38:12.710 --> 03:38:12.720 align:start position:0%
nonetheless
 
03:38:14.710 --> 03:38:14.720 align:start position:0%
can be taken to court if either side
 
03:38:17.670 --> 03:38:17.680 align:start position:0%
doesn't agree with the outcome
 
03:38:19.590 --> 03:38:19.600 align:start position:0%
again i i come back and i urge you to go
 
03:38:21.510 --> 03:38:21.520 align:start position:0%
to the website
 
03:38:23.349 --> 03:38:23.359 align:start position:0%
for the housing appeals board and read
 
03:38:24.469 --> 03:38:24.479 align:start position:0%
through the decisions they're not
 
03:38:26.550 --> 03:38:26.560 align:start position:0%
arduous okay some of them are you know
 
03:38:28.870 --> 03:38:28.880 align:start position:0%
six seven eight pages
 
03:38:31.110 --> 03:38:31.120 align:start position:0%
but read through the conclusions that
 
03:38:32.469 --> 03:38:32.479 align:start position:0%
they draw
 
03:38:34.229 --> 03:38:34.239 align:start position:0%
the laws that they stipple that they
 
03:38:34.239 --> 03:38:35.349 align:start position:0%
the laws that they stipple that they
cite

03:38:35.349 --> 03:38:35.359 align:start position:0%
cite
 
03:38:37.510 --> 03:38:37.520 align:start position:0%
and and the ordinances that are violated
 
03:38:39.030 --> 03:38:39.040 align:start position:0%
and you'll understand the purpose of
 
03:38:41.670 --> 03:38:41.680 align:start position:0%
this board in no way and the actual
 
03:38:43.830 --> 03:38:43.840 align:start position:0%
actions of the board in no way truncate
 
03:38:47.269 --> 03:38:47.279 align:start position:0%
restrict or reduce local control
 
03:38:49.750 --> 03:38:49.760 align:start position:0%
they just merely make certain
 
03:38:52.389 --> 03:38:52.399 align:start position:0%
that that local control is in compliance
 
03:38:53.670 --> 03:38:53.680 align:start position:0%
with the laws of the state of new
 
03:38:55.110 --> 03:38:55.120 align:start position:0%
hampshire the ordinances of the
 
03:38:57.110 --> 03:38:57.120 align:start position:0%
community and the case law that has been
 
03:38:59.590 --> 03:38:59.600 align:start position:0%
derived they're from
 
03:39:03.269 --> 03:39:03.279 align:start position:0%
this is a this is a bad bill 1307 will
 
03:39:05.349 --> 03:39:05.359 align:start position:0%
will truncate
 
03:39:05.359 --> 03:39:06.309 align:start position:0%
will truncate
the

03:39:06.309 --> 03:39:06.319 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:39:09.269 --> 03:39:09.279 align:start position:0%
ability of the housing appeals board to
 
03:39:11.590 --> 03:39:11.600 align:start position:0%
look at decisions for shall we say
 
03:39:14.469 --> 03:39:14.479 align:start position:0%
conservation commission
 
03:39:16.309 --> 03:39:16.319 align:start position:0%
shall we say the fire marshal or the
 
03:39:19.110 --> 03:39:19.120 align:start position:0%
town fire chief
 
03:39:21.269 --> 03:39:21.279 align:start position:0%
notoriously in one case
 
03:39:23.189 --> 03:39:23.199 align:start position:0%
the fire chief decided he wanted an
 
03:39:24.950 --> 03:39:24.960 align:start position:0%
extra driveway that would have cost
 
03:39:26.550 --> 03:39:26.560 align:start position:0%
about two hundred thousand dollars and
 
03:39:28.630 --> 03:39:28.640 align:start position:0%
that killed the project
 
03:39:30.870 --> 03:39:30.880 align:start position:0%
and so we lost a number of housing units
 
03:39:32.469 --> 03:39:32.479 align:start position:0%
that would have worked just fine in one
 
03:39:34.070 --> 03:39:34.080 align:start position:0%
of our communities
 
03:39:37.110 --> 03:39:37.120 align:start position:0%
so to restrict it to specific language
 
03:39:40.309 --> 03:39:40.319 align:start position:0%
that restricts the actual
 
03:39:42.150 --> 03:39:42.160 align:start position:0%
agencies that the housing appeals board
 
03:39:43.830 --> 03:39:43.840 align:start position:0%
can oversee
 
03:39:45.670 --> 03:39:45.680 align:start position:0%
you essentially gut the ability of the
 
03:39:48.469 --> 03:39:48.479 align:start position:0%
board to have the broad purview that it
 
03:39:48.479 --> 03:39:49.670 align:start position:0%
board to have the broad purview that it
needs

03:39:49.670 --> 03:39:49.680 align:start position:0%
needs
 
03:39:51.830 --> 03:39:51.840 align:start position:0%
to look at any rulings that come out of
 
03:39:54.710 --> 03:39:54.720 align:start position:0%
local use boards or other officials
 
03:39:54.720 --> 03:39:55.830 align:start position:0%
local use boards or other officials
okay

03:39:55.830 --> 03:39:55.840 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:39:58.389 --> 03:39:58.399 align:start position:0%
that in fact deny programs from going
 
03:40:01.429 --> 03:40:01.439 align:start position:0%
forward and in this case with 1307
 
03:40:03.349 --> 03:40:03.359 align:start position:0%
would in fact deny the ability to review
 
03:40:06.790 --> 03:40:06.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:09.750 --> 03:40:09.760 align:start position:0%
i ask you to itl this bill
 
03:40:11.030 --> 03:40:11.040 align:start position:0%
read the decisions of the housing
 
03:40:13.030 --> 03:40:13.040 align:start position:0%
appeals board and let's get some housing
 
03:40:14.469 --> 03:40:14.479 align:start position:0%
responsibly brought forward to the
 
03:40:15.990 --> 03:40:16.000 align:start position:0%
people of new hampshire thank you mr
 
03:40:16.000 --> 03:40:16.950 align:start position:0%
people of new hampshire thank you mr
chairman

03:40:16.950 --> 03:40:16.960 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
03:40:18.870 --> 03:40:18.880 align:start position:0%
thank you would you stay and take some
 
03:40:20.790 --> 03:40:20.800 align:start position:0%
questions certainly
 
03:40:22.870 --> 03:40:22.880 align:start position:0%
all right questions for the senator yes
 
03:40:24.950 --> 03:40:24.960 align:start position:0%
representative power
 
03:40:26.710 --> 03:40:26.720 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you senator
 
03:40:29.030 --> 03:40:29.040 align:start position:0%
for taking my question so
 
03:40:31.750 --> 03:40:31.760 align:start position:0%
to be clear
 
03:40:33.910 --> 03:40:33.920 align:start position:0%
in the framework or the bill of the bill
 
03:40:36.710 --> 03:40:36.720 align:start position:0%
lines 6 through 13
 
03:40:39.670 --> 03:40:39.680 align:start position:0%
a through f that struck
 
03:40:43.910 --> 03:40:43.920 align:start position:0%
does that imply that these types of
 
03:40:43.920 --> 03:40:45.349 align:start position:0%
does that imply that these types of
appeals

03:40:45.349 --> 03:40:45.359 align:start position:0%
appeals
 
03:40:48.550 --> 03:40:48.560 align:start position:0%
shall only have the the avenue of
 
03:40:50.870 --> 03:40:50.880 align:start position:0%
appealing and being heard by the
 
03:40:53.990 --> 03:40:54.000 align:start position:0%
superior court is that correct
 
03:40:56.550 --> 03:40:56.560 align:start position:0%
anything that's outside planning board
 
03:40:58.070 --> 03:40:58.080 align:start position:0%
zoning boards of adjustment building
 
03:41:00.229 --> 03:41:00.239 align:start position:0%
code boards appeals historic commissions
 
03:41:01.670 --> 03:41:01.680 align:start position:0%
heritage commissions
 
03:41:03.590 --> 03:41:03.600 align:start position:0%
would then be required to go to superior
 
03:41:03.600 --> 03:41:04.469 align:start position:0%
would then be required to go to superior
court

03:41:04.469 --> 03:41:04.479 align:start position:0%
court
 
03:41:07.030 --> 03:41:07.040 align:start position:0%
incurring delays and expenses that would
 
03:41:08.870 --> 03:41:08.880 align:start position:0%
otherwise not be incurred
 
03:41:10.309 --> 03:41:10.319 align:start position:0%
and if heard by the housing appeals
 
03:41:12.630 --> 03:41:12.640 align:start position:0%
board would still have the right
 
03:41:14.710 --> 03:41:14.720 align:start position:0%
to litigate
 
03:41:14.720 --> 03:41:17.349 align:start position:0%
to litigate
representative

03:41:17.349 --> 03:41:17.359 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:41:21.590 --> 03:41:21.600 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman thank you senator uh
 
03:41:21.600 --> 03:41:23.990 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman thank you senator uh
so

03:41:23.990 --> 03:41:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:25.429 --> 03:41:25.439 align:start position:0%
i had a question oh
 
03:41:27.189 --> 03:41:27.199 align:start position:0%
i know
 
03:41:29.670 --> 03:41:29.680 align:start position:0%
so part of the purpose it seems to be
 
03:41:29.680 --> 03:41:30.630 align:start position:0%
so part of the purpose it seems to be
here

03:41:30.630 --> 03:41:30.640 align:start position:0%
here
 
03:41:32.229 --> 03:41:32.239 align:start position:0%
is to
 
03:41:34.630 --> 03:41:34.640 align:start position:0%
make it impossible to use the housing
 
03:41:36.309 --> 03:41:36.319 align:start position:0%
appeals boards
 
03:41:39.670 --> 03:41:39.680 align:start position:0%
over issues of fire marshals building
 
03:41:42.550 --> 03:41:42.560 align:start position:0%
inspectors uh
 
03:41:44.150 --> 03:41:44.160 align:start position:0%
the road agent
 
03:41:46.070 --> 03:41:46.080 align:start position:0%
is that your understanding of of this
 
03:41:46.080 --> 03:41:48.229 align:start position:0%
is that your understanding of of this
intent

03:41:48.229 --> 03:41:48.239 align:start position:0%
intent
 
03:41:50.150 --> 03:41:50.160 align:start position:0%
i can't speak to the intent of the of
 
03:41:52.550 --> 03:41:52.560 align:start position:0%
the framer and i i streamlessly try to
 
03:41:53.830 --> 03:41:53.840 align:start position:0%
avoid that
 
03:41:55.510 --> 03:41:55.520 align:start position:0%
i just look to the effects that the bill
 
03:41:57.030 --> 03:41:57.040 align:start position:0%
would have and that's exactly what would
 
03:41:57.040 --> 03:41:57.990 align:start position:0%
would have and that's exactly what would
happen

03:41:57.990 --> 03:41:58.000 align:start position:0%
happen
 
03:41:59.349 --> 03:41:59.359 align:start position:0%
follow-up yes
 
03:42:02.630 --> 03:42:02.640 align:start position:0%
and do we see in new hampshire that
 
03:42:02.640 --> 03:42:04.389 align:start position:0%
and do we see in new hampshire that
uh

03:42:04.389 --> 03:42:04.399 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:42:07.110 --> 03:42:07.120 align:start position:0%
i'm going to try not to characterize it
 
03:42:09.510 --> 03:42:09.520 align:start position:0%
actions of the fire marshal building
 
03:42:12.469 --> 03:42:12.479 align:start position:0%
inspector and road agent do
 
03:42:14.309 --> 03:42:14.319 align:start position:0%
sometimes in fact
 
03:42:16.630 --> 03:42:16.640 align:start position:0%
restrict housing without improving
 
03:42:16.640 --> 03:42:19.030 align:start position:0%
restrict housing without improving
safety

03:42:19.030 --> 03:42:19.040 align:start position:0%
safety
 
03:42:21.670 --> 03:42:21.680 align:start position:0%
i have seen that happen
 
03:42:24.150 --> 03:42:24.160 align:start position:0%
in my community and then i represent 27
 
03:42:25.910 --> 03:42:25.920 align:start position:0%
towns pretty big districts so i guess
 
03:42:27.429 --> 03:42:27.439 align:start position:0%
i've seen that happen
 
03:42:30.469 --> 03:42:30.479 align:start position:0%
and again that's in no way in no way
 
03:42:32.630 --> 03:42:32.640 align:start position:0%
truncates the authority
 
03:42:34.309 --> 03:42:34.319 align:start position:0%
of these individuals it just makes
 
03:42:35.670 --> 03:42:35.680 align:start position:0%
certain that they're acting within
 
03:42:37.510 --> 03:42:37.520 align:start position:0%
statutory or ordinance authority that's
 
03:42:40.870 --> 03:42:40.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:42.790 --> 03:42:42.800 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you ma'am any other
 
03:42:44.790 --> 03:42:44.800 align:start position:0%
questions for the senator yes
 
03:42:44.800 --> 03:42:46.870 align:start position:0%
questions for the senator yes
representative

03:42:46.870 --> 03:42:46.880 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:42:49.349 --> 03:42:49.359 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you senator
 
03:42:52.469 --> 03:42:52.479 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
03:42:55.349 --> 03:42:55.359 align:start position:0%
at the beginning of your testimony you
 
03:42:57.750 --> 03:42:57.760 align:start position:0%
alluded to the fact that in fact we are
 
03:43:00.070 --> 03:43:00.080 align:start position:0%
in a housing crisis in new hampshire it
 
03:43:01.670 --> 03:43:01.680 align:start position:0%
is a crisis
 
03:43:01.680 --> 03:43:02.630 align:start position:0%
is a crisis
and

03:43:02.630 --> 03:43:02.640 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:43:02.640 --> 03:43:03.590 align:start position:0%
and
in

03:43:03.590 --> 03:43:03.600 align:start position:0%
in
 
03:43:06.870 --> 03:43:06.880 align:start position:0%
you you know reading it it definitely
 
03:43:09.030 --> 03:43:09.040 align:start position:0%
does not
 
03:43:09.040 --> 03:43:10.309 align:start position:0%
does not
help

03:43:10.309 --> 03:43:10.319 align:start position:0%
help
 
03:43:12.710 --> 03:43:12.720 align:start position:0%
solve the problem that we have on hand
 
03:43:13.910 --> 03:43:13.920 align:start position:0%
which is a
 
03:43:16.309 --> 03:43:16.319 align:start position:0%
shortage of acute
 
03:43:18.950 --> 03:43:18.960 align:start position:0%
so is that the perspective from your
 
03:43:21.110 --> 03:43:21.120 align:start position:0%
angle to this particular
 
03:43:23.990 --> 03:43:24.000 align:start position:0%
bill will hinder
 
03:43:29.510 --> 03:43:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:32.830 --> 03:43:32.840 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure i understand your question
 
03:43:34.550 --> 03:43:34.560 align:start position:0%
um it
 
03:43:38.389 --> 03:43:38.399 align:start position:0%
we have had several housing bills today
 
03:43:40.950 --> 03:43:40.960 align:start position:0%
and you know we're trying to solve an
 
03:43:43.269 --> 03:43:43.279 align:start position:0%
issue which is a crisis level in our
 
03:43:46.710 --> 03:43:46.720 align:start position:0%
state over 20 000 units shortage
 
03:43:50.229 --> 03:43:50.239 align:start position:0%
so from looking at from that angle of
 
03:43:52.950 --> 03:43:52.960 align:start position:0%
providing housing that's much needed
 
03:43:57.030 --> 03:43:57.040 align:start position:0%
housing for everybody across the board
 
03:44:00.150 --> 03:44:00.160 align:start position:0%
this bill will hinder
 
03:44:00.160 --> 03:44:01.030 align:start position:0%
this bill will hinder
any

03:44:01.030 --> 03:44:01.040 align:start position:0%
any
 
03:44:01.040 --> 03:44:02.389 align:start position:0%
any
solution

03:44:02.389 --> 03:44:02.399 align:start position:0%
solution
 
03:44:05.030 --> 03:44:05.040 align:start position:0%
that we would bring because it
 
03:44:07.510 --> 03:44:07.520 align:start position:0%
establishes a very elaborate
 
03:44:07.520 --> 03:44:08.790 align:start position:0%
establishes a very elaborate
process

03:44:08.790 --> 03:44:08.800 align:start position:0%
process
 
03:44:10.150 --> 03:44:10.160 align:start position:0%
that would be my assessment of the
 
03:44:10.160 --> 03:44:11.189 align:start position:0%
that would be my assessment of the
impact

03:44:11.189 --> 03:44:11.199 align:start position:0%
impact
 
03:44:13.030 --> 03:44:13.040 align:start position:0%
by denying the housing appeals board
 
03:44:15.349 --> 03:44:15.359 align:start position:0%
oversight over decisions made by
 
03:44:18.070 --> 03:44:18.080 align:start position:0%
entities or individuals not mentioned
 
03:44:21.110 --> 03:44:21.120 align:start position:0%
specifically in 1307 so yes
 
03:44:25.830 --> 03:44:25.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:25.840 --> 03:44:28.790 align:start position:0%
 
yes

03:44:28.790 --> 03:44:28.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:30.950 --> 03:44:30.960 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you senator
 
03:44:32.550 --> 03:44:32.560 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
03:44:33.830 --> 03:44:33.840 align:start position:0%
one of the things that we've been
 
03:44:37.110 --> 03:44:37.120 align:start position:0%
hearing uh this session is that we are
 
03:44:39.030 --> 03:44:39.040 align:start position:0%
lacking housing as representative
 
03:44:40.469 --> 03:44:40.479 align:start position:0%
manager putin said
 
03:44:42.309 --> 03:44:42.319 align:start position:0%
um but
 
03:44:46.150 --> 03:44:46.160 align:start position:0%
essentially or more keenly in
 
03:44:49.510 --> 03:44:49.520 align:start position:0%
moderate to low-income housing
 
03:44:52.630 --> 03:44:52.640 align:start position:0%
this bill or does this bill address that
 
03:44:54.630 --> 03:44:54.640 align:start position:0%
or is it just all the housing in the
 
03:44:54.640 --> 03:44:56.950 align:start position:0%
or is it just all the housing in the
world

03:44:56.950 --> 03:44:56.960 align:start position:0%
world
 
03:44:58.950 --> 03:44:58.960 align:start position:0%
well i'm i'm going to have to be very
 
03:45:03.750 --> 03:45:03.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:03.760 --> 03:45:04.710 align:start position:0%
 
i

03:45:04.710 --> 03:45:04.720 align:start position:0%
i
 
03:45:06.309 --> 03:45:06.319 align:start position:0%
will refer to a senator in the last
 
03:45:08.950 --> 03:45:08.960 align:start position:0%
session who on her website stated we
 
03:45:11.269 --> 03:45:11.279 align:start position:0%
like our prestige communities
 
03:45:12.790 --> 03:45:12.800 align:start position:0%
and the inference is we don't want that
 
03:45:14.790 --> 03:45:14.800 align:start position:0%
kind of person here
 
03:45:16.309 --> 03:45:16.319 align:start position:0%
right that's not a new hampshire that's
 
03:45:17.910 --> 03:45:17.920 align:start position:0%
not that's not a set of values that i
 
03:45:19.429 --> 03:45:19.439 align:start position:0%
ascribe to
 
03:45:19.439 --> 03:45:20.309 align:start position:0%
ascribe to
okay

03:45:20.309 --> 03:45:20.319 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:45:23.030 --> 03:45:23.040 align:start position:0%
and by denying this is workforce housing
 
03:45:26.630 --> 03:45:26.640 align:start position:0%
some of it uh is for uh those on lower
 
03:45:28.070 --> 03:45:28.080 align:start position:0%
economic spectrum
 
03:45:30.150 --> 03:45:30.160 align:start position:0%
most of it is for those that are working
 
03:45:31.910 --> 03:45:31.920 align:start position:0%
families okay
 
03:45:33.030 --> 03:45:33.040 align:start position:0%
and again
 
03:45:36.389 --> 03:45:36.399 align:start position:0%
uh by by reducing
 
03:45:37.990 --> 03:45:38.000 align:start position:0%
the the
 
03:45:40.070 --> 03:45:40.080 align:start position:0%
um the authority or the scope of the
 
03:45:41.910 --> 03:45:41.920 align:start position:0%
authority of the board
 
03:45:44.070 --> 03:45:44.080 align:start position:0%
you then begin to truncate its ability
 
03:45:47.269 --> 03:45:47.279 align:start position:0%
to mitigate the process and the problem
 
03:45:49.510 --> 03:45:49.520 align:start position:0%
uh so yeah i think i think that would be
 
03:45:52.830 --> 03:45:52.840 align:start position:0%
a fair assessment thank you
 
03:45:55.349 --> 03:45:55.359 align:start position:0%
senator yes represent representative
 
03:45:55.359 --> 03:45:56.630 align:start position:0%
senator yes represent representative
matt

03:45:56.630 --> 03:45:56.640 align:start position:0%
matt
 
03:45:57.990 --> 03:45:58.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you senator
 
03:45:59.429 --> 03:45:59.439 align:start position:0%
for taking my question when the planning
 
03:46:01.429 --> 03:46:01.439 align:start position:0%
board which i sit on and have sat on for
 
03:46:03.030 --> 03:46:03.040 align:start position:0%
10 years and take my responsibility
 
03:46:05.030 --> 03:46:05.040 align:start position:0%
extremely seriously
 
03:46:07.189 --> 03:46:07.199 align:start position:0%
um when we sit on there we take into
 
03:46:09.349 --> 03:46:09.359 align:start position:0%
into account all of the aspects that go
 
03:46:11.349 --> 03:46:11.359 align:start position:0%
into that site plan
 
03:46:14.710 --> 03:46:14.720 align:start position:0%
uh that includes uh recommendations from
 
03:46:14.720 --> 03:46:15.590 align:start position:0%
uh that includes uh recommendations from
or

03:46:15.590 --> 03:46:15.600 align:start position:0%
or
 
03:46:17.990 --> 03:46:18.000 align:start position:0%
reviews from the fire department
 
03:46:20.469 --> 03:46:20.479 align:start position:0%
we we look at water we look at runoff we
 
03:46:22.150 --> 03:46:22.160 align:start position:0%
look at state statutes we look at we
 
03:46:23.830 --> 03:46:23.840 align:start position:0%
look at we look at
 
03:46:25.910 --> 03:46:25.920 align:start position:0%
how does this with the development of
 
03:46:27.830 --> 03:46:27.840 align:start position:0%
housing which would include everything i
 
03:46:30.229 --> 03:46:30.239 align:start position:0%
assume that goes into that review
 
03:46:31.830 --> 03:46:31.840 align:start position:0%
that same review
 
03:46:33.990 --> 03:46:34.000 align:start position:0%
in your opinion does this then say i
 
03:46:36.550 --> 03:46:36.560 align:start position:0%
cannot look at those things that the
 
03:46:38.710 --> 03:46:38.720 align:start position:0%
development of housing is so narrowly
 
03:46:38.720 --> 03:46:39.910 align:start position:0%
development of housing is so narrowly
restricted

03:46:39.910 --> 03:46:39.920 align:start position:0%
restricted
 
03:46:42.229 --> 03:46:42.239 align:start position:0%
that i can only look at
 
03:46:42.239 --> 03:46:43.750 align:start position:0%
that i can only look at
what

03:46:43.750 --> 03:46:43.760 align:start position:0%
what
 
03:46:45.830 --> 03:46:45.840 align:start position:0%
because when i'm sitting on excuse me so
 
03:46:48.389 --> 03:46:48.399 align:start position:0%
i'll leave my question at that no so and
 
03:46:50.710 --> 03:46:50.720 align:start position:0%
your point is well taken but
 
03:46:52.150 --> 03:46:52.160 align:start position:0%
the duties of the planning board are
 
03:46:54.070 --> 03:46:54.080 align:start position:0%
generally stipulated by ordinance we
 
03:46:55.429 --> 03:46:55.439 align:start position:0%
have a planning board in our town we
 
03:46:56.870 --> 03:46:56.880 align:start position:0%
have limited them to lot line
 
03:46:58.550 --> 03:46:58.560 align:start position:0%
adjustments and subdivision approvals
 
03:46:59.910 --> 03:46:59.920 align:start position:0%
and that's it
 
03:47:01.670 --> 03:47:01.680 align:start position:0%
okay there are many communities that go
 
03:47:03.269 --> 03:47:03.279 align:start position:0%
much farther than that there are
 
03:47:05.269 --> 03:47:05.279 align:start position:0%
communities in which the opinions of the
 
03:47:06.710 --> 03:47:06.720 align:start position:0%
fire marshal express to the board of
 
03:47:06.720 --> 03:47:07.750 align:start position:0%
fire marshal express to the board of
selectmen

03:47:07.750 --> 03:47:07.760 align:start position:0%
selectmen
 
03:47:09.429 --> 03:47:09.439 align:start position:0%
uh if in fact you read the decision i
 
03:47:10.550 --> 03:47:10.560 align:start position:0%
handed out
 
03:47:11.910 --> 03:47:11.920 align:start position:0%
board of selectmen is not mentioned in
 
03:47:12.950 --> 03:47:12.960 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
03:47:15.429 --> 03:47:15.439 align:start position:0%
and there are other agencies and and
 
03:47:17.189 --> 03:47:17.199 align:start position:0%
individuals within local community
 
03:47:19.990 --> 03:47:20.000 align:start position:0%
government who would be able to opine
 
03:47:22.229 --> 03:47:22.239 align:start position:0%
and over whose opinion the board would
 
03:47:24.070 --> 03:47:24.080 align:start position:0%
not have jurisdiction
 
03:47:25.750 --> 03:47:25.760 align:start position:0%
because of the way that local community
 
03:47:31.110 --> 03:47:31.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:32.389 --> 03:47:32.399 align:start position:0%
thank you senator
 
03:47:34.309 --> 03:47:34.319 align:start position:0%
very much oh i'm sorry representative
 
03:47:34.319 --> 03:47:40.550 align:start position:0%
very much oh i'm sorry representative
tripp

03:47:40.550 --> 03:47:40.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:42.150 --> 03:47:42.160 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
03:47:45.429 --> 03:47:45.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:47.510 --> 03:47:47.520 align:start position:0%
you made in the uh
 
03:47:49.830 --> 03:47:49.840 align:start position:0%
you cited an example of where
 
03:47:49.840 --> 03:47:50.550 align:start position:0%
you cited an example of where
the

03:47:50.550 --> 03:47:50.560 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:47:53.030 --> 03:47:53.040 align:start position:0%
fire chief or something
 
03:47:54.710 --> 03:47:54.720 align:start position:0%
was going to require
 
03:47:56.870 --> 03:47:56.880 align:start position:0%
a additional road
 
03:47:56.880 --> 03:47:58.070 align:start position:0%
a additional road
uh

03:47:58.070 --> 03:47:58.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:47:58.080 --> 03:47:58.950 align:start position:0%
uh
in

03:47:58.950 --> 03:47:58.960 align:start position:0%
in
 
03:48:01.110 --> 03:48:01.120 align:start position:0%
the town that i live in that would be
 
03:48:03.189 --> 03:48:03.199 align:start position:0%
considered i think a condition of
 
03:48:05.349 --> 03:48:05.359 align:start position:0%
approval is that correct
 
03:48:07.590 --> 03:48:07.600 align:start position:0%
if that's what your town does yes oh
 
03:48:09.750 --> 03:48:09.760 align:start position:0%
right and this is so
 
03:48:11.030 --> 03:48:11.040 align:start position:0%
so the uh
 
03:48:13.189 --> 03:48:13.199 align:start position:0%
the housing appeals board has the
 
03:48:15.590 --> 03:48:15.600 align:start position:0%
authority to to look at everything like
 
03:48:15.600 --> 03:48:16.950 align:start position:0%
authority to to look at everything like
that

03:48:16.950 --> 03:48:16.960 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:48:19.830 --> 03:48:19.840 align:start position:0%
under current law it does
 
03:48:19.840 --> 03:48:20.870 align:start position:0%
under current law it does
because

03:48:20.870 --> 03:48:20.880 align:start position:0%
because
 
03:48:24.229 --> 03:48:24.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:27.269 --> 03:48:27.279 align:start position:0%
they're not disapproving
 
03:48:29.750 --> 03:48:29.760 align:start position:0%
the development they're just citing what
 
03:48:31.830 --> 03:48:31.840 align:start position:0%
they would consider a
 
03:48:31.840 --> 03:48:32.790 align:start position:0%
they would consider a
uh

03:48:32.790 --> 03:48:32.800 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:48:35.030 --> 03:48:35.040 align:start position:0%
aspect that must be included is that
 
03:48:35.040 --> 03:48:36.309 align:start position:0%
aspect that must be included is that
correct

03:48:36.309 --> 03:48:36.319 align:start position:0%
correct
 
03:48:37.990 --> 03:48:38.000 align:start position:0%
that would be correct
 
03:48:40.229 --> 03:48:40.239 align:start position:0%
all right thank you
 
03:48:43.830 --> 03:48:43.840 align:start position:0%
and i think i think if i may uh
 
03:48:43.840 --> 03:48:45.429 align:start position:0%
and i think i think if i may uh
again

03:48:45.429 --> 03:48:45.439 align:start position:0%
again
 
03:48:49.030 --> 03:48:49.040 align:start position:0%
i think 1307 would dangerously restrict
 
03:48:51.590 --> 03:48:51.600 align:start position:0%
the scope of the housing appeals board
 
03:48:54.710 --> 03:48:54.720 align:start position:0%
there are communities have other
 
03:48:58.229 --> 03:48:58.239 align:start position:0%
formed agencies boards or whatever
 
03:48:59.830 --> 03:48:59.840 align:start position:0%
conservation commissions those types of
 
03:48:59.840 --> 03:49:00.790 align:start position:0%
conservation commissions those types of
things

03:49:00.790 --> 03:49:00.800 align:start position:0%
things
 
03:49:02.790 --> 03:49:02.800 align:start position:0%
uh whose purview
 
03:49:03.990 --> 03:49:04.000 align:start position:0%
would not be
 
03:49:05.910 --> 03:49:05.920 align:start position:0%
overseeing what the board does it takes
 
03:49:07.990 --> 03:49:08.000 align:start position:0%
a look at the decision in light of and
 
03:49:09.670 --> 03:49:09.680 align:start position:0%
only in light of
 
03:49:12.790 --> 03:49:12.800 align:start position:0%
existing laws statewide local ordinances
 
03:49:14.710 --> 03:49:14.720 align:start position:0%
and case law and it says you know what
 
03:49:16.309 --> 03:49:16.319 align:start position:0%
and two of these 15 cases he said you
 
03:49:18.630 --> 03:49:18.640 align:start position:0%
know what town is right
 
03:49:21.510 --> 03:49:21.520 align:start position:0%
but in 13 of 15 cases
 
03:49:23.269 --> 03:49:23.279 align:start position:0%
they found that the town violated state
 
03:49:26.070 --> 03:49:26.080 align:start position:0%
law local ordinances or case law which
 
03:49:28.389 --> 03:49:28.399 align:start position:0%
was the court's you know interpretation
 
03:49:30.870 --> 03:49:30.880 align:start position:0%
of a particular case outcome
 
03:49:33.269 --> 03:49:33.279 align:start position:0%
so i ask you to go itl on this bill
 
03:49:35.349 --> 03:49:35.359 align:start position:0%
hab is not broken
 
03:49:36.950 --> 03:49:36.960 align:start position:0%
it doesn't need fixing but our housing
 
03:49:39.590 --> 03:49:39.600 align:start position:0%
situation surely does thank you mr chair
 
03:49:41.349 --> 03:49:41.359 align:start position:0%

03:50:07.910 --> 03:50:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:10.469 --> 03:50:10.479 align:start position:0%

take very long um you know
 
03:50:16.389 --> 03:50:16.399 align:start position:0%
my strong feeling about the need for
 
03:50:18.389 --> 03:50:18.399 align:start position:0%
housing in this state
 
03:50:19.830 --> 03:50:19.840 align:start position:0%
and you know that i am one of the
 
03:50:21.510 --> 03:50:21.520 align:start position:0%
sponsors of
 
03:50:23.189 --> 03:50:23.199 align:start position:0%
establishing the housing appeals board
 
03:50:24.870 --> 03:50:24.880 align:start position:0%
so i am biased
 
03:50:27.670 --> 03:50:27.680 align:start position:0%
i'm also the wife of a planning board
 
03:50:30.309 --> 03:50:30.319 align:start position:0%
member 20-year planning board member
 
03:50:33.189 --> 03:50:33.199 align:start position:0%
chair and for the duration of the
 
03:50:34.710 --> 03:50:34.720 align:start position:0%
emergency orders
 
03:50:36.469 --> 03:50:36.479 align:start position:0%
the town planning board meetings were
 
03:50:36.479 --> 03:50:37.349 align:start position:0%
the town planning board meetings were
held

03:50:37.349 --> 03:50:37.359 align:start position:0%
held
 
03:50:39.910 --> 03:50:39.920 align:start position:0%
out of my office in my home
 
03:50:42.469 --> 03:50:42.479 align:start position:0%
so i was able to listen to the process
 
03:50:43.910 --> 03:50:43.920 align:start position:0%
and understand
 
03:50:45.830 --> 03:50:45.840 align:start position:0%
what my husband was trying to get across
 
03:50:47.750 --> 03:50:47.760 align:start position:0%
to the members of the public and also to
 
03:50:49.910 --> 03:50:49.920 align:start position:0%
the members of his board and he is a
 
03:50:53.030 --> 03:50:53.040 align:start position:0%
strong proponent of if you follow the
 
03:50:53.040 --> 03:50:54.630 align:start position:0%
strong proponent of if you follow the
rules

03:50:54.630 --> 03:50:54.640 align:start position:0%
rules
 
03:50:56.790 --> 03:50:56.800 align:start position:0%
things go better
 
03:50:59.349 --> 03:50:59.359 align:start position:0%
as a matter of fact the town lawyer has
 
03:51:02.070 --> 03:51:02.080 align:start position:0%
praised our cleaning board because when
 
03:51:04.950 --> 03:51:04.960 align:start position:0%
they do go to court the town always wins
 
03:51:08.150 --> 03:51:08.160 align:start position:0%
because they follow their own rules
 
03:51:08.160 --> 03:51:09.670 align:start position:0%
because they follow their own rules
the

03:51:09.670 --> 03:51:09.680 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:51:11.910 --> 03:51:11.920 align:start position:0%
housing appeals board
 
03:51:13.269 --> 03:51:13.279 align:start position:0%
does not
 
03:51:13.279 --> 03:51:14.389 align:start position:0%
does not
change

03:51:14.389 --> 03:51:14.399 align:start position:0%
change
 
03:51:17.269 --> 03:51:17.279 align:start position:0%
town ordinances it does not change the
 
03:51:17.279 --> 03:51:18.150 align:start position:0%
town ordinances it does not change the
law

03:51:18.150 --> 03:51:18.160 align:start position:0%
law
 
03:51:19.830 --> 03:51:19.840 align:start position:0%
it does not
 
03:51:19.840 --> 03:51:21.349 align:start position:0%
it does not
overrule

03:51:21.349 --> 03:51:21.359 align:start position:0%
overrule
 
03:51:23.349 --> 03:51:23.359 align:start position:0%
a bad decision
 
03:51:25.510 --> 03:51:25.520 align:start position:0%
if the decision was made
 
03:51:25.520 --> 03:51:26.950 align:start position:0%
if the decision was made
following

03:51:26.950 --> 03:51:26.960 align:start position:0%
following
 
03:51:29.670 --> 03:51:29.680 align:start position:0%
the ordinances and the regulations that
 
03:51:32.630 --> 03:51:32.640 align:start position:0%
the town has established and the rsas
 
03:51:34.630 --> 03:51:34.640 align:start position:0%
that the state has established
 
03:51:37.750 --> 03:51:37.760 align:start position:0%
what it does do is make a faster process
 
03:51:39.990 --> 03:51:40.000 align:start position:0%
so people can go in and get there get
 
03:51:40.000 --> 03:51:41.189 align:start position:0%
so people can go in and get there get
their

03:51:41.189 --> 03:51:41.199 align:start position:0%
their
 
03:51:43.670 --> 03:51:43.680 align:start position:0%
appeal heard quickly
 
03:51:43.680 --> 03:51:44.389 align:start position:0%
appeal heard quickly
it

03:51:44.389 --> 03:51:44.399 align:start position:0%
it
 
03:51:46.469 --> 03:51:46.479 align:start position:0%
speeds things up the people that are on
 
03:51:49.750 --> 03:51:49.760 align:start position:0%
that board are all land use experts so
 
03:51:51.510 --> 03:51:51.520 align:start position:0%
to speak they have a great deal of
 
03:51:53.990 --> 03:51:54.000 align:start position:0%
knowledge which you might not always get
 
03:51:55.750 --> 03:51:55.760 align:start position:0%
in the superior court when you go in
 
03:51:57.510 --> 03:51:57.520 align:start position:0%
with a thing like this before the
 
03:51:59.830 --> 03:51:59.840 align:start position:0%
housing appeals board those judges might
 
03:52:02.070 --> 03:52:02.080 align:start position:0%
not have a lot of land use and municipal
 
03:52:04.469 --> 03:52:04.479 align:start position:0%
law experience
 
03:52:07.110 --> 03:52:07.120 align:start position:0%
but the appeals board uses the same
 
03:52:09.910 --> 03:52:09.920 align:start position:0%
standards that the court used and the
 
03:52:12.790 --> 03:52:12.800 align:start position:0%
appeal the people who lose or win have a
 
03:52:14.710 --> 03:52:14.720 align:start position:0%
chance to go to the supreme court
 
03:52:17.030 --> 03:52:17.040 align:start position:0%
afterwards if they're not happy so it's
 
03:52:19.349 --> 03:52:19.359 align:start position:0%
it's working people are satisfied
 
03:52:21.110 --> 03:52:21.120 align:start position:0%
they're moving things through
 
03:52:24.309 --> 03:52:24.319 align:start position:0%
we need to be able to get things done in
 
03:52:26.870 --> 03:52:26.880 align:start position:0%
a speedy way to get housing that we need
 
03:52:28.950 --> 03:52:28.960 align:start position:0%
in this state so i hope you will
 
03:52:33.830 --> 03:52:33.840 align:start position:0%
consider itling this bill um it's
 
03:52:35.269 --> 03:52:35.279 align:start position:0%
and i'll take any questions that you
 
03:52:36.630 --> 03:52:36.640 align:start position:0%
have any questions for the
 
03:52:40.070 --> 03:52:40.080 align:start position:0%
representative yes representative
 
03:52:43.510 --> 03:52:43.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr c thank you uh my friend
 
03:52:45.349 --> 03:52:45.359 align:start position:0%
and colleague
 
03:52:47.189 --> 03:52:47.199 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
03:52:48.550 --> 03:52:48.560 align:start position:0%
um so
 
03:52:51.670 --> 03:52:51.680 align:start position:0%
you are very succinct in saying so this
 
03:52:55.110 --> 03:52:55.120 align:start position:0%
bill is basically shifting
 
03:52:56.950 --> 03:52:56.960 align:start position:0%
the local control
 
03:52:58.469 --> 03:52:58.479 align:start position:0%
to the courts
 
03:52:59.990 --> 03:53:00.000 align:start position:0%
is that what
 
03:53:02.070 --> 03:53:02.080 align:start position:0%
in a nutshell that i'm
 
03:53:02.080 --> 03:53:03.349 align:start position:0%
in a nutshell that i'm
understanding

03:53:03.349 --> 03:53:03.359 align:start position:0%
understanding
 
03:53:05.030 --> 03:53:05.040 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure that it's shifting the
 
03:53:08.150 --> 03:53:08.160 align:start position:0%
local control because the ordinances are
 
03:53:11.030 --> 03:53:11.040 align:start position:0%
are determined by the town or the city
 
03:53:12.229 --> 03:53:12.239 align:start position:0%
and the
 
03:53:14.469 --> 03:53:14.479 align:start position:0%
the land use board is supposed to follow
 
03:53:16.469 --> 03:53:16.479 align:start position:0%
those ordinances that the voters have
 
03:53:18.630 --> 03:53:18.640 align:start position:0%
approved so if the land use board has
 
03:53:21.110 --> 03:53:21.120 align:start position:0%
followed those ordinances and there's an
 
03:53:21.120 --> 03:53:23.510 align:start position:0%
followed those ordinances and there's an
appeal

03:53:23.510 --> 03:53:23.520 align:start position:0%
appeal
 
03:53:25.750 --> 03:53:25.760 align:start position:0%
and it goes to the the housing appeals
 
03:53:25.760 --> 03:53:26.790 align:start position:0%
and it goes to the the housing appeals
board

03:53:26.790 --> 03:53:26.800 align:start position:0%
board
 
03:53:29.030 --> 03:53:29.040 align:start position:0%
if the town has followed the rules and
 
03:53:30.870 --> 03:53:30.880 align:start position:0%
their own ordinances then they will get
 
03:53:33.670 --> 03:53:33.680 align:start position:0%
a a ruling in their favor if they have
 
03:53:33.680 --> 03:53:34.469 align:start position:0%
a a ruling in their favor if they have
not

03:53:34.469 --> 03:53:34.479 align:start position:0%
not
 
03:53:36.710 --> 03:53:36.720 align:start position:0%
if you know joe over here wants to
 
03:53:38.469 --> 03:53:38.479 align:start position:0%
manipulate it a little bit because his
 
03:53:40.309 --> 03:53:40.319 align:start position:0%
friend harry is the one that's doing the
 
03:53:42.550 --> 03:53:42.560 align:start position:0%
development then that's might not fly
 
03:53:47.990 --> 03:53:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:50.870 --> 03:53:50.880 align:start position:0%
thank you i mean you're making it uh i
 
03:53:52.870 --> 03:53:52.880 align:start position:0%
didn't frame my question properly you
 
03:53:54.630 --> 03:53:54.640 align:start position:0%
answered it in a way
 
03:53:56.710 --> 03:53:56.720 align:start position:0%
okay that was the question in my mind
 
03:53:57.830 --> 03:53:57.840 align:start position:0%
was that
 
03:54:00.710 --> 03:54:00.720 align:start position:0%
what we have currently is working well
 
03:54:03.349 --> 03:54:03.359 align:start position:0%
in terms of having the overseeing board
 
03:54:05.269 --> 03:54:05.279 align:start position:0%
and the local control
 
03:54:07.910 --> 03:54:07.920 align:start position:0%
and this would flip it on the head
 
03:54:10.870 --> 03:54:10.880 align:start position:0%
it could possibly do that yes thank you
 
03:54:12.550 --> 03:54:12.560 align:start position:0%
thank you any other further questions
 
03:54:14.469 --> 03:54:14.479 align:start position:0%
for the representative
 
03:54:17.429 --> 03:54:17.439 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you
 
03:54:20.710 --> 03:54:20.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:46.229 --> 03:54:46.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:48.150 --> 03:54:48.160 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
03:54:50.309 --> 03:54:50.319 align:start position:0%

03:54:53.590 --> 03:54:53.600 align:start position:0%
express new hampshire housing's
 
03:54:55.510 --> 03:54:55.520 align:start position:0%
opposition to this and we request that
 
03:54:58.950 --> 03:54:58.960 align:start position:0%
you i recommend itl
 
03:55:01.030 --> 03:55:01.040 align:start position:0%
i can't really improve upon the
 
03:55:02.710 --> 03:55:02.720 align:start position:0%
testimony provided by representative
 
03:55:05.429 --> 03:55:05.439 align:start position:0%
porter and senator gaida they thoroughly
 
03:55:07.189 --> 03:55:07.199 align:start position:0%
went through the purposes of the housing
 
03:55:09.349 --> 03:55:09.359 align:start position:0%
appeals board and why
 
03:55:12.150 --> 03:55:12.160 align:start position:0%
um it should be kept as it is
 
03:55:14.469 --> 03:55:14.479 align:start position:0%
i do want to emphasize a couple things
 
03:55:14.479 --> 03:55:15.349 align:start position:0%
i do want to emphasize a couple things
um

03:55:15.349 --> 03:55:15.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:55:19.110 --> 03:55:19.120 align:start position:0%
one is that when when i remember hearing
 
03:55:20.870 --> 03:55:20.880 align:start position:0%
probably last year or the year before
 
03:55:20.880 --> 03:55:21.670 align:start position:0%
probably last year or the year before
when

03:55:21.670 --> 03:55:21.680 align:start position:0%
when
 
03:55:24.070 --> 03:55:24.080 align:start position:0%
uh the housing appeals board was the
 
03:55:26.870 --> 03:55:26.880 align:start position:0%
legislation was pending there was a
 
03:55:27.910 --> 03:55:27.920 align:start position:0%
statement that
 
03:55:29.670 --> 03:55:29.680 align:start position:0%
the authority is ambiguous it's it is
 
03:55:32.389 --> 03:55:32.399 align:start position:0%
not ambiguous it is clear
 
03:55:35.269 --> 03:55:35.279 align:start position:0%
it is about local decisions decisions of
 
03:55:35.279 --> 03:55:36.150 align:start position:0%
it is about local decisions decisions of
local

03:55:36.150 --> 03:55:36.160 align:start position:0%
local
 
03:55:38.550 --> 03:55:38.560 align:start position:0%
boards committees and commissions that's
 
03:55:40.950 --> 03:55:40.960 align:start position:0%
the statute boards committee synthesis
 
03:55:43.110 --> 03:55:43.120 align:start position:0%
and commissions on housing and housing
 
03:55:45.429 --> 03:55:45.439 align:start position:0%
development and it refers to final
 
03:55:45.439 --> 03:55:46.550 align:start position:0%
development and it refers to final
decisions

03:55:46.550 --> 03:55:46.560 align:start position:0%
decisions
 
03:55:50.550 --> 03:55:50.560 align:start position:0%
of boards committees and commissions
 
03:55:52.950 --> 03:55:52.960 align:start position:0%
um so representative power you you asked
 
03:55:54.229 --> 03:55:54.239 align:start position:0%
the question about the the brookline
 
03:55:55.670 --> 03:55:55.680 align:start position:0%
litigation i'm familiar with that
 
03:55:55.680 --> 03:55:57.269 align:start position:0%
litigation i'm familiar with that
litigation

03:55:57.269 --> 03:55:57.279 align:start position:0%
litigation
 
03:56:00.550 --> 03:56:00.560 align:start position:0%
no local board committee or commission
 
03:56:03.990 --> 03:56:04.000 align:start position:0%
made a decision in that case
 
03:56:07.110 --> 03:56:07.120 align:start position:0%
that involved the adoption of a new
 
03:56:08.710 --> 03:56:08.720 align:start position:0%
zoning provision by the town of
 
03:56:10.870 --> 03:56:10.880 align:start position:0%
brookline that is not i believe within
 
03:56:12.389 --> 03:56:12.399 align:start position:0%
the jurisdiction of the housing appeals
 
03:56:14.950 --> 03:56:14.960 align:start position:0%
board that resides exclusively within
 
03:56:16.309 --> 03:56:16.319 align:start position:0%
the courts
 
03:56:17.750 --> 03:56:17.760 align:start position:0%
uh the effect
 
03:56:20.229 --> 03:56:20.239 align:start position:0%
that this uh that house bill 1307 would
 
03:56:20.239 --> 03:56:21.110 align:start position:0%
that this uh that house bill 1307 would
have

03:56:21.110 --> 03:56:21.120 align:start position:0%
have
 
03:56:22.710 --> 03:56:22.720 align:start position:0%
uh would be to
 
03:56:25.830 --> 03:56:25.840 align:start position:0%
push more of these issues back to the
 
03:56:25.840 --> 03:56:27.110 align:start position:0%
push more of these issues back to the
courts

03:56:27.110 --> 03:56:27.120 align:start position:0%
courts
 
03:56:29.510 --> 03:56:29.520 align:start position:0%
right now you can take these questions
 
03:56:31.269 --> 03:56:31.279 align:start position:0%
these local decisions
 
03:56:33.830 --> 03:56:33.840 align:start position:0%
either to superior court or to the
 
03:56:36.469 --> 03:56:36.479 align:start position:0%
housing appeals board
 
03:56:39.269 --> 03:56:39.279 align:start position:0%
so if you have a decision of a planning
 
03:56:40.790 --> 03:56:40.800 align:start position:0%
board or a zoning board or an historic
 
03:56:42.070 --> 03:56:42.080 align:start position:0%
district commission
 
03:56:44.309 --> 03:56:44.319 align:start position:0%
which is within the bill as presented to
 
03:56:44.319 --> 03:56:45.110 align:start position:0%
which is within the bill as presented to
you

03:56:45.110 --> 03:56:45.120 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:56:46.870 --> 03:56:46.880 align:start position:0%
those those can be taken to superior
 
03:56:48.710 --> 03:56:48.720 align:start position:0%
court or they can be taken to the
 
03:56:51.269 --> 03:56:51.279 align:start position:0%
housing appeals board
 
03:56:53.110 --> 03:56:53.120 align:start position:0%
under the current law
 
03:56:54.870 --> 03:56:54.880 align:start position:0%
there are other decisions of other
 
03:56:54.880 --> 03:56:56.150 align:start position:0%
there are other decisions of other
boards

03:56:56.150 --> 03:56:56.160 align:start position:0%
boards
 
03:56:58.469 --> 03:56:58.479 align:start position:0%
that currently can go to the housing
 
03:57:00.070 --> 03:57:00.080 align:start position:0%
appeals board
 
03:57:02.229 --> 03:57:02.239 align:start position:0%
that would no longer be able to be
 
03:57:03.910 --> 03:57:03.920 align:start position:0%
appealed to the housing appeals board
 
03:57:07.030 --> 03:57:07.040 align:start position:0%
should house bill 1307 become law
 
03:57:07.040 --> 03:57:08.150 align:start position:0%
should house bill 1307 become law
and

03:57:08.150 --> 03:57:08.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:57:10.469 --> 03:57:10.479 align:start position:0%
senator gaida circulated a decision i
 
03:57:12.389 --> 03:57:12.399 align:start position:0%
think it's evans versus the town of
 
03:57:15.030 --> 03:57:15.040 align:start position:0%
pembroke which involves the decision of
 
03:57:15.040 --> 03:57:15.990 align:start position:0%
pembroke which involves the decision of
a

03:57:15.990 --> 03:57:16.000 align:start position:0%
a
 
03:57:17.590 --> 03:57:17.600 align:start position:0%
local select board the board of
 
03:57:20.309 --> 03:57:20.319 align:start position:0%
selectmen on the question of whether to
 
03:57:22.870 --> 03:57:22.880 align:start position:0%
reclassify a class six highway to class
 
03:57:22.880 --> 03:57:23.910 align:start position:0%
reclassify a class six highway to class
five

03:57:23.910 --> 03:57:23.920 align:start position:0%
five
 
03:57:23.920 --> 03:57:25.349 align:start position:0%
five
um

03:57:25.349 --> 03:57:25.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:57:29.269 --> 03:57:29.279 align:start position:0%
if house bill 1307 were law
 
03:57:31.510 --> 03:57:31.520 align:start position:0%
that could not go to the housing appeals
 
03:57:33.349 --> 03:57:33.359 align:start position:0%
board even though
 
03:57:36.070 --> 03:57:36.080 align:start position:0%
by its own terms the select board of the
 
03:57:41.030 --> 03:57:41.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:43.030 --> 03:57:43.040 align:start position:0%
that would no longer be appealable to
 
03:57:45.349 --> 03:57:45.359 align:start position:0%
the housing appeals board
 
03:57:48.389 --> 03:57:48.399 align:start position:0%
and in that case uh the the housing
 
03:57:51.349 --> 03:57:51.359 align:start position:0%
appeals board reviewed what the select
 
03:57:52.469 --> 03:57:52.479 align:start position:0%
board in
 
03:57:54.309 --> 03:57:54.319 align:start position:0%
pembroke did
 
03:57:56.070 --> 03:57:56.080 align:start position:0%
found that they had not applied the
 
03:57:58.070 --> 03:57:58.080 align:start position:0%
proper legal standard and remanded it
 
03:58:00.630 --> 03:58:00.640 align:start position:0%
gave them a second chance and on remand
 
03:58:03.110 --> 03:58:03.120 align:start position:0%
under the advice of legal counsel
 
03:58:05.750 --> 03:58:05.760 align:start position:0%
the select board in pembroke changed
 
03:58:07.670 --> 03:58:07.680 align:start position:0%
their decision
 
03:58:07.680 --> 03:58:08.870 align:start position:0%
their decision
allowing

03:58:08.870 --> 03:58:08.880 align:start position:0%
allowing
 
03:58:11.349 --> 03:58:11.359 align:start position:0%
the process to continue this is a not
 
03:58:12.870 --> 03:58:12.880 align:start position:0%
even a proposed development yet it's
 
03:58:14.950 --> 03:58:14.960 align:start position:0%
something that was in the minds of the
 
03:58:17.030 --> 03:58:17.040 align:start position:0%
landowner but they needed to change the
 
03:58:19.030 --> 03:58:19.040 align:start position:0%
road classification in order to be able
 
03:58:21.349 --> 03:58:21.359 align:start position:0%
to proceed with the development
 
03:58:23.269 --> 03:58:23.279 align:start position:0%
then allowing it to go to the planning
 
03:58:25.110 --> 03:58:25.120 align:start position:0%
board which could consider all of the
 
03:58:27.750 --> 03:58:27.760 align:start position:0%
things that uh representative measure
 
03:58:32.389 --> 03:58:32.399 align:start position:0%
you you brought up uh so you know the uh
 
03:58:35.429 --> 03:58:35.439 align:start position:0%
the law as it stands the law and and the
 
03:58:37.670 --> 03:58:37.680 align:start position:0%
bill as proposed would not have any
 
03:58:40.790 --> 03:58:40.800 align:start position:0%
impact on the scope of decisions that
 
03:58:42.150 --> 03:58:42.160 align:start position:0%
the planning board can make and whether
 
03:58:43.429 --> 03:58:43.439 align:start position:0%
they could be reviewed by the housing
 
03:58:45.830 --> 03:58:45.840 align:start position:0%
appeals board so everything that a
 
03:58:47.990 --> 03:58:48.000 align:start position:0%
planning board does
 
03:58:49.670 --> 03:58:49.680 align:start position:0%
that is currently appealable to the
 
03:58:51.750 --> 03:58:51.760 align:start position:0%
housing appeals board would still be
 
03:58:53.349 --> 03:58:53.359 align:start position:0%
appealable to
 
03:58:55.510 --> 03:58:55.520 align:start position:0%
the housing appeals board if house bill
 
03:58:59.429 --> 03:58:59.439 align:start position:0%
1307 became law that's not the issue
 
03:59:01.030 --> 03:59:01.040 align:start position:0%
here it's not the planning board
 
03:59:02.790 --> 03:59:02.800 align:start position:0%
decisions it's not the zoning board
 
03:59:05.670 --> 03:59:05.680 align:start position:0%
decisions it's the decisions of other
 
03:59:07.670 --> 03:59:07.680 align:start position:0%
unenumerated boards
 
03:59:09.910 --> 03:59:09.920 align:start position:0%
committees and commissions that would be
 
03:59:12.710 --> 03:59:12.720 align:start position:0%
cut out and shunted back to the court
 
03:59:14.950 --> 03:59:14.960 align:start position:0%
system as opposed to being able to be
 
03:59:17.110 --> 03:59:17.120 align:start position:0%
taken to the housing appeals board the
 
03:59:18.950 --> 03:59:18.960 align:start position:0%
housing appeals board as senator guida
 
03:59:22.870 --> 03:59:22.880 align:start position:0%
said is not broken so don't fix it
 
03:59:25.670 --> 03:59:25.680 align:start position:0%
it is i believe
 
03:59:29.349 --> 03:59:29.359 align:start position:0%
doing as the legislature intended
 
03:59:31.670 --> 03:59:31.680 align:start position:0%
hearing these appeals efficiently and
 
03:59:34.790 --> 03:59:34.800 align:start position:0%
effectively in a way that neither favors
 
03:59:37.189 --> 03:59:37.199 align:start position:0%
developers nor nor
 
03:59:39.269 --> 03:59:39.279 align:start position:0%
property owners nor the municipalities
 
03:59:41.830 --> 03:59:41.840 align:start position:0%
northern butters all parties are equal
 
03:59:43.990 --> 03:59:44.000 align:start position:0%
before the housing appeals board so for
 
03:59:46.070 --> 03:59:46.080 align:start position:0%
these reasons i
 
03:59:47.830 --> 03:59:47.840 align:start position:0%
respectfully request you to recommend
 
03:59:50.630 --> 03:59:50.640 align:start position:0%
itl on house bill 1307 and be happy to
 
03:59:51.990 --> 03:59:52.000 align:start position:0%
take any questions
 
03:59:54.469 --> 03:59:54.479 align:start position:0%
yes representative vann
 
03:59:56.550 --> 03:59:56.560 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry
 
03:59:59.429 --> 03:59:59.439 align:start position:0%
i am still a representative and
 
04:00:01.510 --> 04:00:01.520 align:start position:0%
uh thank you chairman
 
04:00:05.189 --> 04:00:05.199 align:start position:0%
thank you mr frost mr frost um i was
 
04:00:06.870 --> 04:00:06.880 align:start position:0%
just thinking about what you said about
 
04:00:08.790 --> 04:00:08.800 align:start position:0%
the planning boards and so forth and so
 
04:00:12.710 --> 04:00:12.720 align:start position:0%
on is it your sense that the existence
 
04:00:15.030 --> 04:00:15.040 align:start position:0%
of the housing appeals board
 
04:00:17.189 --> 04:00:17.199 align:start position:0%
has made
 
04:00:20.710 --> 04:00:20.720 align:start position:0%
land use boards more careful
 
04:00:20.720 --> 04:00:22.389 align:start position:0%
land use boards more careful
about

04:00:22.389 --> 04:00:22.399 align:start position:0%
about
 
04:00:27.349 --> 04:00:27.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:29.349 --> 04:00:29.359 align:start position:0%
representative that's an excellent
 
04:00:31.269 --> 04:00:31.279 align:start position:0%
question and i think
 
04:00:31.279 --> 04:00:32.710 align:start position:0%
question and i think
when

04:00:32.710 --> 04:00:32.720 align:start position:0%
when
 
04:00:35.189 --> 04:00:35.199 align:start position:0%
when i was testifying a couple of years
 
04:00:38.790 --> 04:00:38.800 align:start position:0%
ago before this committee on this issue
 
04:00:41.910 --> 04:00:41.920 align:start position:0%
i think that was a hope that i expressed
 
04:00:44.710 --> 04:00:44.720 align:start position:0%
i can't say that after just a year of
 
04:00:46.630 --> 04:00:46.640 align:start position:0%
hearing cases that that has had that
 
04:00:46.640 --> 04:00:48.150 align:start position:0%
hearing cases that that has had that
effect

04:00:48.150 --> 04:00:48.160 align:start position:0%
effect
 
04:00:50.950 --> 04:00:50.960 align:start position:0%
although i suspect that where
 
04:00:52.790 --> 04:00:52.800 align:start position:0%
um a
 
04:00:55.910 --> 04:00:55.920 align:start position:0%
municipality a local board has had an
 
04:00:57.429 --> 04:00:57.439 align:start position:0%
issue remanded
 
04:00:58.950 --> 04:00:58.960 align:start position:0%
by the housing appeals board and they've
 
04:01:00.790 --> 04:01:00.800 align:start position:0%
been given the opportunity to do it
 
04:01:02.870 --> 04:01:02.880 align:start position:0%
right the second time they have made
 
04:01:05.349 --> 04:01:05.359 align:start position:0%
better decisions witness uh in the the
 
04:01:06.790 --> 04:01:06.800 align:start position:0%
town of pembroke the select board's
 
04:01:09.269 --> 04:01:09.279 align:start position:0%
decision in other situations they're not
 
04:01:12.309 --> 04:01:12.319 align:start position:0%
remanded uh because there's no reason to
 
04:01:14.150 --> 04:01:14.160 align:start position:0%
and i think you know
 
04:01:18.070 --> 04:01:18.080 align:start position:0%
when when a when a board loses
 
04:01:20.630 --> 04:01:20.640 align:start position:0%
because they made a bad decision i hope
 
04:01:22.550 --> 04:01:22.560 align:start position:0%
it's a learning experience
 
04:01:24.630 --> 04:01:24.640 align:start position:0%
there are plenty of examples in the
 
04:01:26.950 --> 04:01:26.960 align:start position:0%
courts and the housing appeals board too
 
04:01:29.349 --> 04:01:29.359 align:start position:0%
where local boards have simply made bad
 
04:01:32.070 --> 04:01:32.080 align:start position:0%
decisions they haven't provided adequate
 
04:01:34.870 --> 04:01:34.880 align:start position:0%
uh you know findings in support of their
 
04:01:36.469 --> 04:01:36.479 align:start position:0%
decisions or they've applied the wrong
 
04:01:38.070 --> 04:01:38.080 align:start position:0%
standard of law
 
04:01:39.830 --> 04:01:39.840 align:start position:0%
you know those those are appropriately
 
04:01:41.830 --> 04:01:41.840 align:start position:0%
reversible and
 
04:01:44.469 --> 04:01:44.479 align:start position:0%
if you know the if the
 
04:01:46.389 --> 04:01:46.399 align:start position:0%
local board is paying attention
 
04:01:48.389 --> 04:01:48.399 align:start position:0%
i hope that they would take some lessons
 
04:01:49.590 --> 04:01:49.600 align:start position:0%
from it
 
04:01:53.189 --> 04:01:53.199 align:start position:0%
and make better decisions in the future
 
04:01:55.269 --> 04:01:55.279 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:01:57.590 --> 04:01:57.600 align:start position:0%
okay well thank you mr fry oh i'm sorry
 
04:02:00.550 --> 04:02:00.560 align:start position:0%
one more representative tripp
 
04:02:02.150 --> 04:02:02.160 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman thank you for taking
 
04:02:03.349 --> 04:02:03.359 align:start position:0%
my question
 
04:02:03.359 --> 04:02:04.150 align:start position:0%
my question
uh

04:02:04.150 --> 04:02:04.160 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:02:05.830 --> 04:02:05.840 align:start position:0%
i noticed one other thing that's in in
 
04:02:08.630 --> 04:02:08.640 align:start position:0%
this bill is that the uh
 
04:02:12.070 --> 04:02:12.080 align:start position:0%
in order to go before the uh housing
 
04:02:14.309 --> 04:02:14.319 align:start position:0%
assessment board housing appeals appeal
 
04:02:16.550 --> 04:02:16.560 align:start position:0%
board uh you have to have made an
 
04:02:16.560 --> 04:02:17.750 align:start position:0%
board uh you have to have made an
application

04:02:17.750 --> 04:02:17.760 align:start position:0%
application
 
04:02:19.510 --> 04:02:19.520 align:start position:0%
i i i think
 
04:02:23.030 --> 04:02:23.040 align:start position:0%
some of the things that you said is
 
04:02:25.830 --> 04:02:25.840 align:start position:0%
people developers are
 
04:02:28.389 --> 04:02:28.399 align:start position:0%
can make use of the board to
 
04:02:29.830 --> 04:02:29.840 align:start position:0%
test run
 
04:02:29.840 --> 04:02:31.349 align:start position:0%
test run
decisions

04:02:31.349 --> 04:02:31.359 align:start position:0%
decisions
 
04:02:34.550 --> 04:02:34.560 align:start position:0%
it's uh you said in the brookfield co
 
04:02:37.189 --> 04:02:37.199 align:start position:0%
case uh the selectmen
 
04:02:39.349 --> 04:02:39.359 align:start position:0%
uh made a decision not to change the the
 
04:02:46.309 --> 04:02:46.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:48.630 --> 04:02:48.640 align:start position:0%
the developer went to the
 
04:02:48.640 --> 04:02:49.590 align:start position:0%
the developer went to the
house

04:02:49.590 --> 04:02:49.600 align:start position:0%
house
 
04:02:57.910 --> 04:02:57.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:59.510 --> 04:02:59.520 align:start position:0%
is is this
 
04:03:01.189 --> 04:03:01.199 align:start position:0%
what the uh
 
04:03:04.070 --> 04:03:04.080 align:start position:0%
the the board was
 
04:03:08.229 --> 04:03:08.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:11.269 --> 04:03:11.279 align:start position:0%
let me um go back to
 
04:03:13.990 --> 04:03:14.000 align:start position:0%
to validate or dis validate uh these
 
04:03:16.469 --> 04:03:16.479 align:start position:0%
types of conditions
 
04:03:18.550 --> 04:03:18.560 align:start position:0%
well representative uh you you've asked
 
04:03:21.189 --> 04:03:21.199 align:start position:0%
a question that i think combines a
 
04:03:24.950 --> 04:03:24.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:27.590 --> 04:03:27.600 align:start position:0%
it's the language of house bill 1307
 
04:03:31.110 --> 04:03:31.120 align:start position:0%
that talks about applications yes the
 
04:03:33.429 --> 04:03:33.439 align:start position:0%
the current law
 
04:03:37.590 --> 04:03:37.600 align:start position:0%
as it stands talks about final decisions
 
04:03:39.670 --> 04:03:39.680 align:start position:0%
so however you get
 
04:03:41.990 --> 04:03:42.000 align:start position:0%
a local board to have made a final
 
04:03:45.110 --> 04:03:45.120 align:start position:0%
decision on something uh whether it's
 
04:03:46.870 --> 04:03:46.880 align:start position:0%
and i think this typically would be
 
04:03:49.189 --> 04:03:49.199 align:start position:0%
through applications so you file an
 
04:03:51.030 --> 04:03:51.040 align:start position:0%
application for a subdivision or site
 
04:03:53.590 --> 04:03:53.600 align:start position:0%
plan review with the planning board you
 
04:03:55.670 --> 04:03:55.680 align:start position:0%
file an application with the board of
 
04:03:58.550 --> 04:03:58.560 align:start position:0%
adjustment for a variance or a special
 
04:03:58.560 --> 04:04:00.070 align:start position:0%
adjustment for a variance or a special
exception

04:04:00.070 --> 04:04:00.080 align:start position:0%
exception
 
04:04:02.229 --> 04:04:02.239 align:start position:0%
you file an application for
 
04:04:02.239 --> 04:04:03.110 align:start position:0%
you file an application for
a

04:04:03.110 --> 04:04:03.120 align:start position:0%
a
 
04:04:04.469 --> 04:04:04.479 align:start position:0%
building permit with the building
 
04:04:06.389 --> 04:04:06.399 align:start position:0%
inspector that then gets appealed to the
 
04:04:08.229 --> 04:04:08.239 align:start position:0%
local building code board of appeals
 
04:04:10.309 --> 04:04:10.319 align:start position:0%
which is then all of those are then
 
04:04:12.150 --> 04:04:12.160 align:start position:0%
appealable to
 
04:04:14.309 --> 04:04:14.319 align:start position:0%
the housing appeals board if they deal
 
04:04:16.070 --> 04:04:16.080 align:start position:0%
with housing
 
04:04:18.870 --> 04:04:18.880 align:start position:0%
so they all involve an application
 
04:04:21.189 --> 04:04:21.199 align:start position:0%
but they that the key
 
04:04:23.030 --> 04:04:23.040 align:start position:0%
is not the fact of the application the
 
04:04:23.040 --> 04:04:24.389 align:start position:0%
is not the fact of the application the
key

04:04:24.389 --> 04:04:24.399 align:start position:0%
key
 
04:04:25.910 --> 04:04:25.920 align:start position:0%
where the housing appeals board
 
04:04:28.150 --> 04:04:28.160 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction begins
 
04:04:33.110 --> 04:04:33.120 align:start position:0%
is with the final decision of that board
 
04:04:34.870 --> 04:04:34.880 align:start position:0%
whether it's a an application that's
 
04:04:36.870 --> 04:04:36.880 align:start position:0%
been brought to them or
 
04:04:38.469 --> 04:04:38.479 align:start position:0%
in the case of
 
04:04:41.429 --> 04:04:41.439 align:start position:0%
a road reclassification it's a request
 
04:04:42.950 --> 04:04:42.960 align:start position:0%
presented to
 
04:04:45.189 --> 04:04:45.199 align:start position:0%
the select board i know there's not a
 
04:04:46.790 --> 04:04:46.800 align:start position:0%
there's not a form i don't think that
 
04:04:48.790 --> 04:04:48.800 align:start position:0%
most municipalities have that's that
 
04:04:50.710 --> 04:04:50.720 align:start position:0%
calls for road reclassification so it's
 
04:04:53.269 --> 04:04:53.279 align:start position:0%
not not an application but it is a
 
04:04:55.349 --> 04:04:55.359 align:start position:0%
request that is made to
 
04:04:59.590 --> 04:04:59.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:01.670 --> 04:05:01.680 align:start position:0%
whether there is a formal application
 
04:05:04.710 --> 04:05:04.720 align:start position:0%
that's on a sheet of paper or online
 
04:05:06.389 --> 04:05:06.399 align:start position:0%
or it's a request
 
04:05:08.630 --> 04:05:08.640 align:start position:0%
is not really the issue under current
 
04:05:11.349 --> 04:05:11.359 align:start position:0%
law it's the fact that a local board
 
04:05:14.150 --> 04:05:14.160 align:start position:0%
committee or commission has made a final
 
04:05:14.160 --> 04:05:15.510 align:start position:0%
committee or commission has made a final
decision

04:05:15.510 --> 04:05:15.520 align:start position:0%
decision
 
04:05:17.349 --> 04:05:17.359 align:start position:0%
on something that's been presented to it
 
04:05:18.790 --> 04:05:18.800 align:start position:0%
regarding housing and housing
 
04:05:20.229 --> 04:05:20.239 align:start position:0%
development that's where the housing
 
04:05:23.349 --> 04:05:23.359 align:start position:0%
appeals for jurisdiction begins
 
04:05:23.359 --> 04:05:25.429 align:start position:0%
appeals for jurisdiction begins
representative

04:05:25.429 --> 04:05:25.439 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:05:27.269 --> 04:05:27.279 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman again thank you mr
 
04:05:27.279 --> 04:05:28.150 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman again thank you mr
frost

04:05:28.150 --> 04:05:28.160 align:start position:0%
frost
 
04:05:28.160 --> 04:05:29.030 align:start position:0%
frost
so

04:05:29.030 --> 04:05:29.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:05:30.950 --> 04:05:30.960 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that the housing
 
04:05:34.150 --> 04:05:34.160 align:start position:0%
appeals board exists
 
04:05:37.830 --> 04:05:37.840 align:start position:0%
uh as sort of a statewide zoning board
 
04:05:41.510 --> 04:05:41.520 align:start position:0%
of appeals you had to you had to go
 
04:05:43.750 --> 04:05:43.760 align:start position:0%
through the application process whatever
 
04:05:45.910 --> 04:05:45.920 align:start position:0%
it is whether it's asking the select
 
04:05:47.990 --> 04:05:48.000 align:start position:0%
board or whomever
 
04:05:50.550 --> 04:05:50.560 align:start position:0%
and a decision was rendered i presented
 
04:05:52.790 --> 04:05:52.800 align:start position:0%
my project it got turned down for
 
04:05:55.189 --> 04:05:55.199 align:start position:0%
reasons that i consider to be specious
 
04:05:55.199 --> 04:05:56.309 align:start position:0%
reasons that i consider to be specious
therefore

04:05:56.309 --> 04:05:56.319 align:start position:0%
therefore
 
04:05:58.469 --> 04:05:58.479 align:start position:0%
i can go to the housing appeals board
 
04:06:00.469 --> 04:06:00.479 align:start position:0%
i can't look
 
04:06:02.710 --> 04:06:02.720 align:start position:0%
at your code
 
04:06:02.720 --> 04:06:03.510 align:start position:0%
at your code
and

04:06:03.510 --> 04:06:03.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:06:06.469 --> 04:06:06.479 align:start position:0%
ask the housing appeals board to render
 
04:06:09.590 --> 04:06:09.600 align:start position:0%
a judgment on whether your town's
 
04:06:12.790 --> 04:06:12.800 align:start position:0%
adopted code is or is not good for
 
04:06:15.030 --> 04:06:15.040 align:start position:0%
what i want to do i have to go all the
 
04:06:17.269 --> 04:06:17.279 align:start position:0%
way through the process
 
04:06:19.910 --> 04:06:19.920 align:start position:0%
and get turned down before i can go to
 
04:06:22.469 --> 04:06:22.479 align:start position:0%
the appeals board is that correct
 
04:06:24.790 --> 04:06:24.800 align:start position:0%
it it is but i would disagree with your
 
04:06:26.630 --> 04:06:26.640 align:start position:0%
characterization of the housing appeals
 
04:06:29.670 --> 04:06:29.680 align:start position:0%
board as a statewide okay
 
04:06:31.110 --> 04:06:31.120 align:start position:0%
i was trying to think about what could i
 
04:06:32.950 --> 04:06:32.960 align:start position:0%
describe and let me explain the
 
04:06:35.590 --> 04:06:35.600 align:start position:0%
distinction because it's very important
 
04:06:37.670 --> 04:06:37.680 align:start position:0%
a local board of adjustment the zoning
 
04:06:39.670 --> 04:06:39.680 align:start position:0%
board of adjustment
 
04:06:42.950 --> 04:06:42.960 align:start position:0%
hears cases de novo
 
04:06:44.710 --> 04:06:44.720 align:start position:0%
it's they they're starting over they're
 
04:06:47.349 --> 04:06:47.359 align:start position:0%
putting themselves in the place of the
 
04:06:48.950 --> 04:06:48.960 align:start position:0%
original decision maker whether it was
 
04:06:50.309 --> 04:06:50.319 align:start position:0%
the planning board decision that gets
 
04:06:52.469 --> 04:06:52.479 align:start position:0%
appealed to the zba or the select board
 
04:06:54.309 --> 04:06:54.319 align:start position:0%
or the building inspector decision that
 
04:06:56.870 --> 04:06:56.880 align:start position:0%
gets appealed to the zba it's de novo
 
04:06:56.880 --> 04:06:57.750 align:start position:0%
gets appealed to the zba it's de novo
meaning

04:06:57.750 --> 04:06:57.760 align:start position:0%
meaning
 
04:06:59.750 --> 04:06:59.760 align:start position:0%
they are starting over
 
04:07:03.189 --> 04:07:03.199 align:start position:0%
appeals to superior court and to the
 
04:07:05.910 --> 04:07:05.920 align:start position:0%
housing appeals board of the decisions
 
04:07:08.550 --> 04:07:08.560 align:start position:0%
of a cpa or a planning board are on the
 
04:07:11.670 --> 04:07:11.680 align:start position:0%
record they are not de novo they take
 
04:07:13.189 --> 04:07:13.199 align:start position:0%
the certified record from the
 
04:07:15.590 --> 04:07:15.600 align:start position:0%
municipality they don't generally
 
04:07:18.150 --> 04:07:18.160 align:start position:0%
speaking take new evidence
 
04:07:21.030 --> 04:07:21.040 align:start position:0%
this is a really important
 
04:07:22.389 --> 04:07:22.399 align:start position:0%
legal distinction
 
04:07:22.399 --> 04:07:23.349 align:start position:0%
legal distinction
between

04:07:23.349 --> 04:07:23.359 align:start position:0%
between
 
04:07:26.229 --> 04:07:26.239 align:start position:0%
what the the zba does locally and what
 
04:07:27.349 --> 04:07:27.359 align:start position:0%
the court
 
04:07:30.070 --> 04:07:30.080 align:start position:0%
or the housing appeals board either one
 
04:07:32.710 --> 04:07:32.720 align:start position:0%
does at the the state level if you will
 
04:07:34.309 --> 04:07:34.319 align:start position:0%
uh it is
 
04:07:38.550 --> 04:07:38.560 align:start position:0%
um there's great deference is provided
 
04:07:39.830 --> 04:07:39.840 align:start position:0%
by the
 
04:07:41.990 --> 04:07:42.000 align:start position:0%
court and by the housing appeals board
 
04:07:43.750 --> 04:07:43.760 align:start position:0%
to local decisions they're not looking
 
04:07:45.670 --> 04:07:45.680 align:start position:0%
to overturn they're looking to support
 
04:07:48.469 --> 04:07:48.479 align:start position:0%
the decision unless it was unreasonable
 
04:07:52.469 --> 04:07:52.479 align:start position:0%
or contrary to law that's the standard
 
04:07:55.269 --> 04:07:55.279 align:start position:0%
thank you mr frost
 
04:07:56.870 --> 04:07:56.880 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you mr
 
04:07:58.790 --> 04:07:58.800 align:start position:0%
frost for taking my question
 
04:08:01.030 --> 04:08:01.040 align:start position:0%
um when you go to the housing appeal
 
04:08:03.910 --> 04:08:03.920 align:start position:0%
board's website they list
 
04:08:05.830 --> 04:08:05.840 align:start position:0%
they list matters that are that you can
 
04:08:05.840 --> 04:08:06.790 align:start position:0%
they list matters that are that you can
appeal

04:08:06.790 --> 04:08:06.800 align:start position:0%
appeal
 
04:08:08.790 --> 04:08:08.800 align:start position:0%
and they reference the statute which
 
04:08:11.429 --> 04:08:11.439 align:start position:0%
lists matters that you can appeal
 
04:08:14.229 --> 04:08:14.239 align:start position:0%
but in the statute it lists and you know
 
04:08:16.229 --> 04:08:16.239 align:start position:0%
one of one of the members of my planning
 
04:08:19.750 --> 04:08:19.760 align:start position:0%
board mr well a gentleman who
 
04:08:22.309 --> 04:08:22.319 align:start position:0%
states that if you have to write it down
 
04:08:24.229 --> 04:08:24.239 align:start position:0%
you've immediately lost the battle
 
04:08:25.990 --> 04:08:26.000 align:start position:0%
because you can never write everything
 
04:08:28.149 --> 04:08:28.159 align:start position:0%
down that is included
 
04:08:29.990 --> 04:08:30.000 align:start position:0%
so the statute includes the little
 
04:08:33.510 --> 04:08:33.520 align:start position:0%
phrase but is not limited to
 
04:08:37.189 --> 04:08:37.199 align:start position:0%
can you please tell me who decides
 
04:08:39.990 --> 04:08:40.000 align:start position:0%
what the limits are
 
04:08:42.870 --> 04:08:42.880 align:start position:0%
in the appeal
 
04:08:45.269 --> 04:08:45.279 align:start position:0%
in the first and thank you for that very
 
04:08:47.830 --> 04:08:47.840 align:start position:0%
good question uh in the first instance
 
04:08:50.469 --> 04:08:50.479 align:start position:0%
it would be the housing appeals board
 
04:08:53.590 --> 04:08:53.600 align:start position:0%
to decide whether it was in within their
 
04:08:56.550 --> 04:08:56.560 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction the same way a court makes
 
04:08:59.990 --> 04:09:00.000 align:start position:0%
the a decision so is it within their
 
04:09:01.830 --> 04:09:01.840 align:start position:0%
power to hear
 
04:09:03.670 --> 04:09:03.680 align:start position:0%
the matter before them do they have
 
04:09:05.030 --> 04:09:05.040 align:start position:0%
what's called subject matter
 
04:09:05.040 --> 04:09:06.469 align:start position:0%
what's called subject matter
jurisdiction

04:09:06.469 --> 04:09:06.479 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction
 
04:09:09.910 --> 04:09:09.920 align:start position:0%
that that is a a the initial threshold
 
04:09:09.920 --> 04:09:10.950 align:start position:0%
that that is a a the initial threshold
question

04:09:10.950 --> 04:09:10.960 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:09:13.510 --> 04:09:13.520 align:start position:0%
that any appellate body has to ask
 
04:09:13.520 --> 04:09:14.630 align:start position:0%
that any appellate body has to ask
itself

04:09:14.630 --> 04:09:14.640 align:start position:0%
itself
 
04:09:17.269 --> 04:09:17.279 align:start position:0%
do we have subject matter jurisdiction
 
04:09:20.070 --> 04:09:20.080 align:start position:0%
to hear this thing whatever it is
 
04:09:22.149 --> 04:09:22.159 align:start position:0%
so it's the the court or the housing
 
04:09:24.630 --> 04:09:24.640 align:start position:0%
appeals board the the the question is
 
04:09:26.790 --> 04:09:26.800 align:start position:0%
the same do we have subject subject
 
04:09:28.710 --> 04:09:28.720 align:start position:0%
matter jurisdiction and so the housing
 
04:09:31.349 --> 04:09:31.359 align:start position:0%
appeals board looks to the statute
 
04:09:33.349 --> 04:09:33.359 align:start position:0%
and sees these things and if it's not
 
04:09:35.590 --> 04:09:35.600 align:start position:0%
enumerated you're right there's this
 
04:09:36.790 --> 04:09:36.800 align:start position:0%
other phrase
 
04:09:39.189 --> 04:09:39.199 align:start position:0%
includes but is not limited to so then
 
04:09:41.349 --> 04:09:41.359 align:start position:0%
they have to interpret more broadly is
 
04:09:43.510 --> 04:09:43.520 align:start position:0%
this something about housing and housing
 
04:09:45.189 --> 04:09:45.199 align:start position:0%
development is it within the broader
 
04:09:48.309 --> 04:09:48.319 align:start position:0%
structure of rsa chapter 679 the housing
 
04:09:50.229 --> 04:09:50.239 align:start position:0%
appeals board statute if the answer is
 
04:09:51.750 --> 04:09:51.760 align:start position:0%
yes then they find that they have
 
04:09:53.990 --> 04:09:54.000 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction if the answer is no they
 
04:09:55.269 --> 04:09:55.279 align:start position:0%
don't have jurisdiction and they don't
 
04:09:56.630 --> 04:09:56.640 align:start position:0%
hear the case
 
04:09:58.630 --> 04:09:58.640 align:start position:0%
if one of the parties disagrees with
 
04:09:59.830 --> 04:09:59.840 align:start position:0%
that decision
 
04:10:02.229 --> 04:10:02.239 align:start position:0%
that decision is appealable
 
04:10:04.149 --> 04:10:04.159 align:start position:0%
to the supreme court and the supreme
 
04:10:06.389 --> 04:10:06.399 align:start position:0%
court does hear these questions not they
 
04:10:08.309 --> 04:10:08.319 align:start position:0%
haven't yet heard a housing appeals
 
04:10:10.309 --> 04:10:10.319 align:start position:0%
board appeal i don't think although
 
04:10:11.830 --> 04:10:11.840 align:start position:0%
there may have been one one or two that
 
04:10:14.229 --> 04:10:14.239 align:start position:0%
have had oral arguments already but no
 
04:10:15.670 --> 04:10:15.680 align:start position:0%
final decisions
 
04:10:15.680 --> 04:10:16.870 align:start position:0%
final decisions
um

04:10:16.870 --> 04:10:16.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:10:19.110 --> 04:10:19.120 align:start position:0%
but there it's a very frequent question
 
04:10:21.910 --> 04:10:21.920 align:start position:0%
for the supreme court to hear on appeal
 
04:10:23.990 --> 04:10:24.000 align:start position:0%
from a trial court decision is there
 
04:10:25.990 --> 04:10:26.000 align:start position:0%
subject matter jurisdiction and if the
 
04:10:27.189 --> 04:10:27.199 align:start position:0%
answer is no
 
04:10:29.590 --> 04:10:29.600 align:start position:0%
then the then the decision where court
 
04:10:36.550 --> 04:10:36.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:38.870 --> 04:10:38.880 align:start position:0%

04:11:05.830 --> 04:11:05.840 align:start position:0%
statewide nonprofit whose mission is to
 
04:11:08.149 --> 04:11:08.159 align:start position:0%
attract and retain more young people as
 
04:11:10.149 --> 04:11:10.159 align:start position:0%
in my previous testimony on a previous
 
04:11:12.389 --> 04:11:12.399 align:start position:0%
bill you know we are very supportive of
 
04:11:14.790 --> 04:11:14.800 align:start position:0%
legislation that seeks to make housing
 
04:11:16.309 --> 04:11:16.319 align:start position:0%
more affordable here in new hampshire
 
04:11:17.830 --> 04:11:17.840 align:start position:0%
because that again is the number one
 
04:11:19.830 --> 04:11:19.840 align:start position:0%
barrier to attracting and retaining
 
04:11:21.910 --> 04:11:21.920 align:start position:0%
young people here in the granite state i
 
04:11:24.070 --> 04:11:24.080 align:start position:0%
don't have more to add certainly than um
 
04:11:26.309 --> 04:11:26.319 align:start position:0%
than the sponsor of this bill then mr
 
04:11:28.950 --> 04:11:28.960 align:start position:0%
frost and senator gaida all spoke to it
 
04:11:31.349 --> 04:11:31.359 align:start position:0%
uh to a degree and knowledge and
 
04:11:33.670 --> 04:11:33.680 align:start position:0%
specificity which i couldn't begin to
 
04:11:36.070 --> 04:11:36.080 align:start position:0%
approach i will however say that uh we
 
04:11:37.990 --> 04:11:38.000 align:start position:0%
are in opposition you to this bill and
 
04:11:41.269 --> 04:11:41.279 align:start position:0%
likewise would like to see it itild
 
04:11:44.790 --> 04:11:44.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:44.800 --> 04:11:46.149 align:start position:0%
 
yes

04:11:46.149 --> 04:11:46.159 align:start position:0%
yes
 
04:11:46.159 --> 04:11:49.349 align:start position:0%
yes
representatives

04:11:49.349 --> 04:11:49.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:50.950 --> 04:11:50.960 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
04:11:53.590 --> 04:11:53.600 align:start position:0%
taking my question as i understand the
 
04:11:55.429 --> 04:11:55.439 align:start position:0%
housing appeals board has absolutely
 
04:11:58.309 --> 04:11:58.319 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with affordability
 
04:12:00.790 --> 04:12:00.800 align:start position:0%
um it is simply
 
04:12:03.670 --> 04:12:03.680 align:start position:0%
a method where a developer can appeal a
 
04:12:05.910 --> 04:12:05.920 align:start position:0%
planning board decision but that that
 
04:12:08.790 --> 04:12:08.800 align:start position:0%
decision may be about a development of
 
04:12:11.510 --> 04:12:11.520 align:start position:0%
multi-million dollar homes
 
04:12:12.469 --> 04:12:12.479 align:start position:0%
i think it
 
04:12:14.389 --> 04:12:14.399 align:start position:0%
as i understand it you're right it could
 
04:12:16.309 --> 04:12:16.319 align:start position:0%
run the gamut you know any type of you
 
04:12:18.870 --> 04:12:18.880 align:start position:0%
know housing uh i will say you know
 
04:12:20.630 --> 04:12:20.640 align:start position:0%
while it might not be direct there is
 
04:12:23.590 --> 04:12:23.600 align:start position:0%
certainly a correlation in your supply
 
04:12:25.189 --> 04:12:25.199 align:start position:0%
and demand again as i spoke on a
 
04:12:27.110 --> 04:12:27.120 align:start position:0%
previous bill you know we need more
 
04:12:29.110 --> 04:12:29.120 align:start position:0%
supply and that it's you know the supply
 
04:12:32.229 --> 04:12:32.239 align:start position:0%
is being i think artificially uh
 
04:12:33.910 --> 04:12:33.920 align:start position:0%
and in some cases deliberately
 
04:12:36.149 --> 04:12:36.159 align:start position:0%
suppressed in in some towns in this
 
04:12:38.469 --> 04:12:38.479 align:start position:0%
state uh that are contravening their own
 
04:12:40.550 --> 04:12:40.560 align:start position:0%
ordinances and state law you know to not
 
04:12:42.550 --> 04:12:42.560 align:start position:0%
allow you know certain types of housing
 
04:12:44.550 --> 04:12:44.560 align:start position:0%
particularly housing of the rental
 
04:12:46.710 --> 04:12:46.720 align:start position:0%
variety and that might be probably more
 
04:12:48.710 --> 04:12:48.720 align:start position:0%
affordable to younger people in
 
04:12:50.630 --> 04:12:50.640 align:start position:0%
particular that we represent but all
 
04:12:52.149 --> 04:12:52.159 align:start position:0%
granite staters
 
04:12:54.070 --> 04:12:54.080 align:start position:0%
follow up mr chairman
 
04:12:56.149 --> 04:12:56.159 align:start position:0%
are you aware of any
 
04:12:58.149 --> 04:12:58.159 align:start position:0%
decisions that the housing appeals board
 
04:13:01.189 --> 04:13:01.199 align:start position:0%
has rendered with respect to affordable
 
04:13:02.870 --> 04:13:02.880 align:start position:0%
housing developments
 
04:13:05.349 --> 04:13:05.359 align:start position:0%
i am not personally i would defer to uh
 
04:13:07.030 --> 04:13:07.040 align:start position:0%
you know people who are have more
 
04:13:10.830 --> 04:13:10.840 align:start position:0%
expertise in the board itself thank you
 
04:13:12.710 --> 04:13:12.720 align:start position:0%
okay uh thank you appreciate your
 
04:13:12.720 --> 04:13:14.149 align:start position:0%
okay uh thank you appreciate your
testimony

04:13:14.149 --> 04:13:14.159 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
04:13:16.070 --> 04:13:16.080 align:start position:0%
next we'll hear from natch grace in the
 
04:13:16.080 --> 04:13:21.110 align:start position:0%
next we'll hear from natch grace in the
nhma

04:13:21.110 --> 04:13:21.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:22.870 --> 04:13:22.880 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman h grace for the
 
04:13:25.189 --> 04:13:25.199 align:start position:0%
new hampshire municipal association
 
04:13:27.910 --> 04:13:27.920 align:start position:0%
we support this bill um it will be very
 
04:13:30.469 --> 04:13:30.479 align:start position:0%
brief i thank attorney frost for
 
04:13:33.189 --> 04:13:33.199 align:start position:0%
summarizing the effects of the bill i i
 
04:13:34.309 --> 04:13:34.319 align:start position:0%
agree with
 
04:13:36.790 --> 04:13:36.800 align:start position:0%
his characterization that this is really
 
04:13:39.110 --> 04:13:39.120 align:start position:0%
about determining what the scope of the
 
04:13:42.070 --> 04:13:42.080 align:start position:0%
housing appeals board should be
 
04:13:45.030 --> 04:13:45.040 align:start position:0%
we obviously disagree with his position
 
04:13:47.189 --> 04:13:47.199 align:start position:0%
and we think it should be limited
 
04:13:47.199 --> 04:13:48.550 align:start position:0%
and we think it should be limited
um

04:13:48.550 --> 04:13:48.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:13:48.560 --> 04:13:50.070 align:start position:0%
um
and

04:13:50.070 --> 04:13:50.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:13:50.080 --> 04:13:50.950 align:start position:0%
and
our

04:13:50.950 --> 04:13:50.960 align:start position:0%
our
 
04:13:50.960 --> 04:13:51.670 align:start position:0%
our
our

04:13:51.670 --> 04:13:51.680 align:start position:0%
our
 
04:13:55.510 --> 04:13:55.520 align:start position:0%
contention is really um against that uh
 
04:13:57.590 --> 04:13:57.600 align:start position:0%
that court decision that i believe
 
04:13:59.189 --> 04:13:59.199 align:start position:0%
senator guida handed out which i believe
 
04:14:01.750 --> 04:14:01.760 align:start position:0%
to be the evans versus town pembroke
 
04:14:01.760 --> 04:14:03.269 align:start position:0%
to be the evans versus town pembroke
decision

04:14:03.269 --> 04:14:03.279 align:start position:0%
decision
 
04:14:03.279 --> 04:14:04.389 align:start position:0%
decision
where

04:14:04.389 --> 04:14:04.399 align:start position:0%
where
 
04:14:07.510 --> 04:14:07.520 align:start position:0%
the housing appeals board heard the
 
04:14:09.189 --> 04:14:09.199 align:start position:0%
appeal over whether to reclassify a
 
04:14:13.189 --> 04:14:13.199 align:start position:0%
class 6 road as a class 5 road
 
04:14:15.110 --> 04:14:15.120 align:start position:0%
we don't view that as something that
 
04:14:16.710 --> 04:14:16.720 align:start position:0%
that would relate to questions of
 
04:14:18.870 --> 04:14:18.880 align:start position:0%
housing and housing development
 
04:14:20.950 --> 04:14:20.960 align:start position:0%
which is the purpose of the board
 
04:14:22.630 --> 04:14:22.640 align:start position:0%
i understand there's disagreement about
 
04:14:24.389 --> 04:14:24.399 align:start position:0%
that i'm certainly happy to answer any
 
04:14:25.910 --> 04:14:25.920 align:start position:0%
questions the board
 
04:14:28.389 --> 04:14:28.399 align:start position:0%
that the committee has any questions yes
 
04:14:28.399 --> 04:14:30.309 align:start position:0%
that the committee has any questions yes
representative

04:14:30.309 --> 04:14:30.319 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:14:31.990 --> 04:14:32.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
04:14:34.830 --> 04:14:34.840 align:start position:0%
um thank you for taking my
 
04:14:34.840 --> 04:14:36.550 align:start position:0%
um thank you for taking my
question

04:14:36.550 --> 04:14:36.560 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:14:40.229 --> 04:14:40.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:43.349 --> 04:14:43.359 align:start position:0%
road you give an example of road
 
04:14:46.149 --> 04:14:46.159 align:start position:0%
isn't that the infrastructure needed for
 
04:14:46.159 --> 04:14:47.510 align:start position:0%
isn't that the infrastructure needed for
development

04:14:47.510 --> 04:14:47.520 align:start position:0%
development
 
04:14:48.830 --> 04:14:48.840 align:start position:0%
and so
 
04:14:48.840 --> 04:14:50.469 align:start position:0%
and so
if

04:14:50.469 --> 04:14:50.479 align:start position:0%
if
 
04:14:53.670 --> 04:14:53.680 align:start position:0%
development of a home or a community
 
04:14:56.469 --> 04:14:56.479 align:start position:0%
and so if that was one of the things
 
04:14:56.479 --> 04:14:57.349 align:start position:0%
and so if that was one of the things
that

04:14:57.349 --> 04:14:57.359 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:14:58.790 --> 04:14:58.800 align:start position:0%
makes you
 
04:15:03.030 --> 04:15:03.040 align:start position:0%
makes the nhma support this bill and
 
04:15:06.070 --> 04:15:06.080 align:start position:0%
negates everything else
 
04:15:06.080 --> 04:15:07.349 align:start position:0%
negates everything else
so

04:15:07.349 --> 04:15:07.359 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:15:07.359 --> 04:15:08.149 align:start position:0%
so
the

04:15:08.149 --> 04:15:08.159 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:15:10.630 --> 04:15:10.640 align:start position:0%
justification doesn't die for me so i'm
 
04:15:12.149 --> 04:15:12.159 align:start position:0%
just trying to
 
04:15:13.429 --> 04:15:13.439 align:start position:0%
right so
 
04:15:16.550 --> 04:15:16.560 align:start position:0%
as uh as attorney frost um
 
04:15:19.189 --> 04:15:19.199 align:start position:0%
briefly summarized um
 
04:15:20.870 --> 04:15:20.880 align:start position:0%
the question the case was just whether
 
04:15:23.269 --> 04:15:23.279 align:start position:0%
to reclassify the road
 
04:15:23.279 --> 04:15:24.309 align:start position:0%
to reclassify the road
and

04:15:24.309 --> 04:15:24.319 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:15:25.910 --> 04:15:25.920 align:start position:0%
a large amount of the discussion ended
 
04:15:27.349 --> 04:15:27.359 align:start position:0%
up being well will there be future
 
04:15:28.630 --> 04:15:28.640 align:start position:0%
development on the road and how will
 
04:15:30.950 --> 04:15:30.960 align:start position:0%
that affect the municipality
 
04:15:32.469 --> 04:15:32.479 align:start position:0%
but it wasn't like
 
04:15:34.870 --> 04:15:34.880 align:start position:0%
it wasn't as if there was an application
 
04:15:37.189 --> 04:15:37.199 align:start position:0%
to put that development in place
 
04:15:39.510 --> 04:15:39.520 align:start position:0%
and part of that was
 
04:15:39.520 --> 04:15:40.469 align:start position:0%
and part of that was
a

04:15:40.469 --> 04:15:40.479 align:start position:0%
a
 
04:15:42.389 --> 04:15:42.399 align:start position:0%
rebuilding of the road or reclassified
 
04:15:44.469 --> 04:15:44.479 align:start position:0%
or something like that so it wasn't
 
04:15:46.469 --> 04:15:46.479 align:start position:0%
it wasn't as tangentially attached to
 
04:15:50.630 --> 04:15:50.640 align:start position:0%
housing as we believe that it should be
 
04:15:52.389 --> 04:15:52.399 align:start position:0%
i hope that clarifies things i'm not
 
04:15:56.070 --> 04:15:56.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:56.080 --> 04:15:59.189 align:start position:0%
 
but

04:15:59.189 --> 04:15:59.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:04.149 --> 04:16:04.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:07.990 --> 04:16:08.000 align:start position:0%
your justification for support
 
04:16:10.229 --> 04:16:10.239 align:start position:0%
seems very weak
 
04:16:11.750 --> 04:16:11.760 align:start position:0%
to me
 
04:16:14.469 --> 04:16:14.479 align:start position:0%
in terms of housing so in you know in
 
04:16:16.469 --> 04:16:16.479 align:start position:0%
context to the housing so
 
04:16:19.110 --> 04:16:19.120 align:start position:0%
that's just my response i understand
 
04:16:20.630 --> 04:16:20.640 align:start position:0%
your position
 
04:16:23.030 --> 04:16:23.040 align:start position:0%
representative gilman yes thank you mr
 
04:16:24.229 --> 04:16:24.239 align:start position:0%

question
um

04:16:27.110 --> 04:16:27.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:16:28.870 --> 04:16:28.880 align:start position:0%
let's see how to
 
04:16:31.349 --> 04:16:31.359 align:start position:0%
would you say that the uh currently
 
04:16:31.359 --> 04:16:32.630 align:start position:0%
would you say that the uh currently
existing

04:16:32.630 --> 04:16:32.640 align:start position:0%
existing
 
04:16:35.110 --> 04:16:35.120 align:start position:0%
rsa versus the
 
04:16:37.429 --> 04:16:37.439 align:start position:0%
bill that's introduced
 
04:16:37.439 --> 04:16:38.309 align:start position:0%
bill that's introduced
would

04:16:38.309 --> 04:16:38.319 align:start position:0%
would
 
04:16:38.319 --> 04:16:40.389 align:start position:0%
would
um

04:16:40.389 --> 04:16:40.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:16:43.349 --> 04:16:43.359 align:start position:0%
change the question of which board sees
 
04:16:46.630 --> 04:16:46.640 align:start position:0%
the case first and and um for example
 
04:16:48.149 --> 04:16:48.159 align:start position:0%
does an hdc
 
04:16:49.830 --> 04:16:49.840 align:start position:0%
go to the planning board first or does
 
04:16:52.070 --> 04:16:52.080 align:start position:0%
the planning board go to the hdc
 
04:16:54.309 --> 04:16:54.319 align:start position:0%
vice versa so one of them says yes i can
 
04:16:57.189 --> 04:16:57.199 align:start position:0%
do this when they go to the second board
 
04:17:01.429 --> 04:17:01.439 align:start position:0%
would you see that this um helps that no
 
04:17:04.389 --> 04:17:04.399 align:start position:0%
no the way i would see it is
 
04:17:06.309 --> 04:17:06.319 align:start position:0%
so currently the housing appeals board
 
04:17:06.319 --> 04:17:07.189 align:start position:0%
so currently the housing appeals board
takes

04:17:07.189 --> 04:17:07.199 align:start position:0%
takes
 
04:17:09.349 --> 04:17:09.359 align:start position:0%
any question that they think relates to
 
04:17:10.710 --> 04:17:10.720 align:start position:0%
housing and
 
04:17:13.830 --> 04:17:13.840 align:start position:0%
the statute is written doesn't
 
04:17:15.349 --> 04:17:15.359 align:start position:0%
really have a definition it has a list
 
04:17:17.670 --> 04:17:17.680 align:start position:0%
of examples and then says anything else
 
04:17:20.149 --> 04:17:20.159 align:start position:0%
that relates to housing
 
04:17:22.149 --> 04:17:22.159 align:start position:0%
what the bill would do
 
04:17:25.189 --> 04:17:25.199 align:start position:0%
is simply limit to appeals from
 
04:17:27.830 --> 04:17:27.840 align:start position:0%
municipal land use boards so you know
 
04:17:31.110 --> 04:17:31.120 align:start position:0%
what boards can appeal to the hab and
 
04:17:33.429 --> 04:17:33.439 align:start position:0%
which ones can't um so if it was
 
04:17:33.439 --> 04:17:34.389 align:start position:0%
which ones can't um so if it was
something

04:17:34.389 --> 04:17:34.399 align:start position:0%
something
 
04:17:36.469 --> 04:17:36.479 align:start position:0%
you know to continue to use my road
 
04:17:36.479 --> 04:17:38.630 align:start position:0%
you know to continue to use my road
example

04:17:38.630 --> 04:17:38.640 align:start position:0%
example
 
04:17:40.550 --> 04:17:40.560 align:start position:0%
if it was the case that a
 
04:17:42.469 --> 04:17:42.479 align:start position:0%
developer was coming in they were
 
04:17:44.550 --> 04:17:44.560 align:start position:0%
building a
 
04:17:46.950 --> 04:17:46.960 align:start position:0%
proposing a development and part of that
 
04:17:49.429 --> 04:17:49.439 align:start position:0%
proposal included
 
04:17:51.269 --> 04:17:51.279 align:start position:0%
an upgrade to a road
 
04:17:53.189 --> 04:17:53.199 align:start position:0%
and that fell under the planning board's
 
04:17:53.199 --> 04:17:54.870 align:start position:0%
and that fell under the planning board's
jurisdiction

04:17:54.870 --> 04:17:54.880 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction
 
04:17:57.349 --> 04:17:57.359 align:start position:0%
that would be appealable to the hab but
 
04:17:59.269 --> 04:17:59.279 align:start position:0%
if it was just somebody came in and said
 
04:18:01.030 --> 04:18:01.040 align:start position:0%
hey i live on a classic sword i want you
 
04:18:03.429 --> 04:18:03.439 align:start position:0%
to clap reclassify that as a class five
 
04:18:04.790 --> 04:18:04.800 align:start position:0%
road and that's a question before the
 
04:18:07.030 --> 04:18:07.040 align:start position:0%
select board that would not be
 
04:18:12.149 --> 04:18:12.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:14.710 --> 04:18:14.720 align:start position:0%
okay thank you uh mr graves oh i'm sorry
 
04:18:17.189 --> 04:18:17.199 align:start position:0%
mr representative tripp
 
04:18:27.110 --> 04:18:27.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:27.120 --> 04:18:30.389 align:start position:0%
 
anyhow

04:18:30.389 --> 04:18:30.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:31.830 --> 04:18:31.840 align:start position:0%
is it
 
04:18:35.349 --> 04:18:35.359 align:start position:0%
true to say that the major flaw
 
04:18:38.309 --> 04:18:38.319 align:start position:0%
with the current existing law is that
 
04:18:38.319 --> 04:18:39.189 align:start position:0%
with the current existing law is that
the

04:18:39.189 --> 04:18:39.199 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:18:41.189 --> 04:18:41.199 align:start position:0%
housing appeal
 
04:18:41.199 --> 04:18:42.309 align:start position:0%
housing appeal
board

04:18:42.309 --> 04:18:42.319 align:start position:0%
board
 
04:18:46.149 --> 04:18:46.159 align:start position:0%
uh is is just unbounded
 
04:18:48.389 --> 04:18:48.399 align:start position:0%
that's our position yes
 
04:18:49.910 --> 04:18:49.920 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:18:51.269 --> 04:18:51.279 align:start position:0%
okay uh
 
04:18:56.550 --> 04:18:56.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:58.550 --> 04:18:58.560 align:start position:0%
next uh alyssa margolin are you still
 
04:18:58.560 --> 04:19:01.510 align:start position:0%
next uh alyssa margolin are you still
here

04:19:01.510 --> 04:19:01.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:14.870 --> 04:19:14.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:17.189 --> 04:19:17.199 align:start position:0%
the committee my name is alyssa margalyn
 
04:19:19.349 --> 04:19:19.359 align:start position:0%
i serve as director of housing action
 
04:19:21.510 --> 04:19:21.520 align:start position:0%
new hampshire we're a statewide
 
04:19:24.389 --> 04:19:24.399 align:start position:0%
coalition of 80 organizations united
 
04:19:27.030 --> 04:19:27.040 align:start position:0%
around affordable housing policy and
 
04:19:29.910 --> 04:19:29.920 align:start position:0%
ending homelessness in new hampshire
 
04:19:31.910 --> 04:19:31.920 align:start position:0%
housing action new hampshire opposes
 
04:19:34.389 --> 04:19:34.399 align:start position:0%
house bill 1307
 
04:19:35.910 --> 04:19:35.920 align:start position:0%
but we do really welcome this
 
04:19:38.950 --> 04:19:38.960 align:start position:0%
opportunity to address broader concerns
 
04:19:41.830 --> 04:19:41.840 align:start position:0%
about the housing appeals board clarify
 
04:19:43.269 --> 04:19:43.279 align:start position:0%
the origins
 
04:19:45.110 --> 04:19:45.120 align:start position:0%
and debunk some of the myths that have
 
04:19:48.149 --> 04:19:48.159 align:start position:0%
been circulating about the board
 
04:19:50.309 --> 04:19:50.319 align:start position:0%
we found that our discussions with house
 
04:19:52.149 --> 04:19:52.159 align:start position:0%
judiciary and those bills that were
 
04:19:55.030 --> 04:19:55.040 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier house bill
 
04:19:55.040 --> 04:19:56.550 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier house bill
1216

04:19:56.550 --> 04:19:56.560 align:start position:0%
1216
 
04:19:56.560 --> 04:19:57.510 align:start position:0%
1216
and

04:19:57.510 --> 04:19:57.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:20:00.149 --> 04:20:00.159 align:start position:0%
house bill 1254 that were recently
 
04:20:04.309 --> 04:20:04.319 align:start position:0%
recommended itl by house judiciary 18-3
 
04:20:06.309 --> 04:20:06.319 align:start position:0%
that having
 
04:20:08.950 --> 04:20:08.960 align:start position:0%
these hearings actually helped
 
04:20:10.710 --> 04:20:10.720 align:start position:0%
understand what the housing appeals
 
04:20:13.670 --> 04:20:13.680 align:start position:0%
board is and what it is not
 
04:20:13.680 --> 04:20:15.269 align:start position:0%
board is and what it is not
so

04:20:15.269 --> 04:20:15.279 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:20:17.750 --> 04:20:17.760 align:start position:0%
one of those
 
04:20:19.189 --> 04:20:19.199 align:start position:0%
one of the
 
04:20:21.189 --> 04:20:21.199 align:start position:0%
ways to understand how affordable
 
04:20:22.790 --> 04:20:22.800 align:start position:0%
housing developers so the members of
 
04:20:24.630 --> 04:20:24.640 align:start position:0%
housing action new hampshire are those
 
04:20:26.870 --> 04:20:26.880 align:start position:0%
who develop manage finance affordable
 
04:20:28.870 --> 04:20:28.880 align:start position:0%
housing properties supportive housing
 
04:20:31.189 --> 04:20:31.199 align:start position:0%
providers homeless service agencies and
 
04:20:34.149 --> 04:20:34.159 align:start position:0%
public housing agencies
 
04:20:36.070 --> 04:20:36.080 align:start position:0%
and it's important to recognize i think
 
04:20:38.630 --> 04:20:38.640 align:start position:0%
that's been noted already is that we
 
04:20:40.309 --> 04:20:40.319 align:start position:0%
were one of a broader group of
 
04:20:42.550 --> 04:20:42.560 align:start position:0%
stakeholders this is not just about
 
04:20:44.710 --> 04:20:44.720 align:start position:0%
affordable housing it's about all
 
04:20:44.720 --> 04:20:46.229 align:start position:0%
affordable housing it's about all
housing

04:20:46.229 --> 04:20:46.239 align:start position:0%
housing
 
04:20:47.990 --> 04:20:48.000 align:start position:0%
another thing is about the history of
 
04:20:50.229 --> 04:20:50.239 align:start position:0%
the legislation about this idea that
 
04:20:52.870 --> 04:20:52.880 align:start position:0%
somehow this bill was not debated in
 
04:20:54.469 --> 04:20:54.479 align:start position:0%
this body when in fact it was and i
 
04:20:56.070 --> 04:20:56.080 align:start position:0%
thought senator guida did a good job
 
04:20:57.269 --> 04:20:57.279 align:start position:0%
walking through the history of the
 
04:20:57.279 --> 04:20:59.189 align:start position:0%
walking through the history of the
legislation

04:20:59.189 --> 04:20:59.199 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
04:20:59.199 --> 04:20:59.990 align:start position:0%
legislation
and

04:20:59.990 --> 04:21:00.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:21:01.349 --> 04:21:01.359 align:start position:0%
so and that's also included in my
 
04:21:02.950 --> 04:21:02.960 align:start position:0%
written testimony so i won't repeat that
 
04:21:05.189 --> 04:21:05.199 align:start position:0%
as well
 
04:21:07.189 --> 04:21:07.199 align:start position:0%
if the
 
04:21:09.030 --> 04:21:09.040 align:start position:0%
the authors and those who had worked for
 
04:21:11.349 --> 04:21:11.359 align:start position:0%
many years to uh
 
04:21:14.550 --> 04:21:14.560 align:start position:0%
to write rsa 679 and to create the
 
04:21:18.070 --> 04:21:18.080 align:start position:0%
housing appeals board uh wanted to make
 
04:21:20.389 --> 04:21:20.399 align:start position:0%
sure that this new entity designed you
 
04:21:22.870 --> 04:21:22.880 align:start position:0%
know based on the model of the btla
 
04:21:24.790 --> 04:21:24.800 align:start position:0%
would provide this faster review subject
 
04:21:27.510 --> 04:21:27.520 align:start position:0%
matter expertise but only after local
 
04:21:29.670 --> 04:21:29.680 align:start position:0%
reviews were exhausted
 
04:21:31.349 --> 04:21:31.359 align:start position:0%
they wanted to make sure it was clear
 
04:21:34.149 --> 04:21:34.159 align:start position:0%
couldn't rewrite local zoning or
 
04:21:36.550 --> 04:21:36.560 align:start position:0%
subdivision regulations or site plan
 
04:21:38.950 --> 04:21:38.960 align:start position:0%
regulations or master plans this idea
 
04:21:41.110 --> 04:21:41.120 align:start position:0%
that local control was still at the core
 
04:21:43.349 --> 04:21:43.359 align:start position:0%
of how we functioned in our state in
 
04:21:45.349 --> 04:21:45.359 align:start position:0%
fact it was the new hampshire municipal
 
04:21:45.359 --> 04:21:47.189 align:start position:0%
fact it was the new hampshire municipal
association

04:21:47.189 --> 04:21:47.199 align:start position:0%
association
 
04:21:48.630 --> 04:21:48.640 align:start position:0%
uh in
 
04:21:51.590 --> 04:21:51.600 align:start position:0%
their legislative bulletin in 2019
 
04:21:53.990 --> 04:21:54.000 align:start position:0%
reviewed the legislation and said the
 
04:21:55.990 --> 04:21:56.000 align:start position:0%
board would apply the same law and the
 
04:21:58.309 --> 04:21:58.319 align:start position:0%
same standards that a judge would apply
 
04:22:00.550 --> 04:22:00.560 align:start position:0%
so municipality would not be prejudiced
 
04:22:02.309 --> 04:22:02.319 align:start position:0%
by having an appeal brought to the board
 
04:22:06.550 --> 04:22:06.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:09.030 --> 04:22:09.040 align:start position:0%
the there's also this myth that somehow
 
04:22:11.349 --> 04:22:11.359 align:start position:0%
the benefits of
 
04:22:14.070 --> 04:22:14.080 align:start position:0%
a faster review only benefits the
 
04:22:16.070 --> 04:22:16.080 align:start position:0%
applicant but when obviously it can
 
04:22:17.990 --> 04:22:18.000 align:start position:0%
benefit the defendant as well so cost
 
04:22:18.000 --> 04:22:19.189 align:start position:0%
benefit the defendant as well so cost
savings

04:22:19.189 --> 04:22:19.199 align:start position:0%
savings
 
04:22:21.910 --> 04:22:21.920 align:start position:0%
um one of the real concerns around this
 
04:22:24.469 --> 04:22:24.479 align:start position:0%
bill as proposed is that we would be
 
04:22:27.670 --> 04:22:27.680 align:start position:0%
reopening the door to kind of tactical
 
04:22:29.590 --> 04:22:29.600 align:start position:0%
use of delay
 
04:22:31.510 --> 04:22:31.520 align:start position:0%
right that's what we were seeking to
 
04:22:31.520 --> 04:22:32.870 align:start position:0%
right that's what we were seeking to
address

04:22:32.870 --> 04:22:32.880 align:start position:0%
address
 
04:22:32.880 --> 04:22:33.670 align:start position:0%
address
so

04:22:33.670 --> 04:22:33.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:22:36.710 --> 04:22:36.720 align:start position:0%
many um affordable housing developers
 
04:22:39.030 --> 04:22:39.040 align:start position:0%
never appeal their decisions they cannot
 
04:22:42.630 --> 04:22:42.640 align:start position:0%
pass on the cost of litigation to their
 
04:22:45.349 --> 04:22:45.359 align:start position:0%
tenants right and so um
 
04:22:48.630 --> 04:22:48.640 align:start position:0%
having a faster and less costly review
 
04:22:49.990 --> 04:22:50.000 align:start position:0%
process where you actually don't even
 
04:22:51.670 --> 04:22:51.680 align:start position:0%
need to engage an attorney you could use
 
04:22:53.830 --> 04:22:53.840 align:start position:0%
your your local you know you could use
 
04:22:56.630 --> 04:22:56.640 align:start position:0%
your engineer your architect even
 
04:22:56.640 --> 04:22:57.590 align:start position:0%
your engineer your architect even
um

04:22:57.590 --> 04:22:57.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:22:59.429 --> 04:22:59.439 align:start position:0%
is a real benefit to affordable housing
 
04:23:01.189 --> 04:23:01.199 align:start position:0%
developers and the question asked
 
04:23:03.750 --> 04:23:03.760 align:start position:0%
earlier about affordability
 
04:23:03.760 --> 04:23:06.229 align:start position:0%
earlier about affordability
um

04:23:06.229 --> 04:23:06.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:08.389 --> 04:23:08.399 align:start position:0%
the the actual decision that senator
 
04:23:10.469 --> 04:23:10.479 align:start position:0%
guida shared with you earlier the one
 
04:23:12.790 --> 04:23:12.800 align:start position:0%
that would not have been able to go
 
04:23:15.110 --> 04:23:15.120 align:start position:0%
before the board
 
04:23:17.189 --> 04:23:17.199 align:start position:0%
should we have had language as proposed
 
04:23:20.149 --> 04:23:20.159 align:start position:0%
in 1307 that one was related to an
 
04:23:22.389 --> 04:23:22.399 align:start position:0%
affordable housing development
 
04:23:24.710 --> 04:23:24.720 align:start position:0%
um in the end we just urge you not to
 
04:23:27.030 --> 04:23:27.040 align:start position:0%
reopen the door to gamesmanship we don't
 
04:23:31.269 --> 04:23:31.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:33.670 --> 04:23:33.680 align:start position:0%
a way to kind of circumvent
 
04:23:36.469 --> 04:23:36.479 align:start position:0%
the the process to say well you know if
 
04:23:37.910 --> 04:23:37.920 align:start position:0%
i if i
 
04:23:40.309 --> 04:23:40.319 align:start position:0%
try to kill this project through
 
04:23:41.910 --> 04:23:41.920 align:start position:0%
something that's not appealable to the
 
04:23:43.750 --> 04:23:43.760 align:start position:0%
housing appeals board that forced it to
 
04:23:46.710 --> 04:23:46.720 align:start position:0%
go to superior court i know that i can
 
04:23:48.550 --> 04:23:48.560 align:start position:0%
therefore impose three years of
 
04:23:51.670 --> 04:23:51.680 align:start position:0%
litigation and really those types of
 
04:23:54.309 --> 04:23:54.319 align:start position:0%
delay tactics that kills the affordable
 
04:23:56.550 --> 04:23:56.560 align:start position:0%
projects way faster than it kills the
 
04:23:58.870 --> 04:23:58.880 align:start position:0%
other projects so with that we urge you
 
04:24:00.870 --> 04:24:00.880 align:start position:0%
to itl the bill and thank you very much
 
04:24:03.189 --> 04:24:03.199 align:start position:0%
for your service and staying for such a
 
04:24:04.469 --> 04:24:04.479 align:start position:0%
long hearing
 
04:24:07.830 --> 04:24:07.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:09.670 --> 04:24:09.680 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much for your
 
04:24:09.680 --> 04:24:10.870 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much for your
testimony

04:24:10.870 --> 04:24:10.880 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
04:24:13.990 --> 04:24:14.000 align:start position:0%
and last but not least we have a david
 
04:24:21.590 --> 04:24:21.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:21.600 --> 04:24:22.710 align:start position:0%
 
welcome

04:24:22.710 --> 04:24:22.720 align:start position:0%
welcome
 
04:24:24.149 --> 04:24:24.159 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair members of the
 
04:24:26.070 --> 04:24:26.080 align:start position:0%
committee recognizing i am the last
 
04:24:28.229 --> 04:24:28.239 align:start position:0%
person to testify i will keep this very
 
04:24:28.239 --> 04:24:29.349 align:start position:0%
person to testify i will keep this very
brief

04:24:29.349 --> 04:24:29.359 align:start position:0%
brief
 
04:24:32.550 --> 04:24:32.560 align:start position:0%
um i want to make a couple of points um
 
04:24:34.229 --> 04:24:34.239 align:start position:0%
one is i want to correct a couple of
 
04:24:36.070 --> 04:24:36.080 align:start position:0%
statements from the bill's sponsor that
 
04:24:37.830 --> 04:24:37.840 align:start position:0%
i think
 
04:24:39.510 --> 04:24:39.520 align:start position:0%
were incorrect
 
04:24:42.229 --> 04:24:42.239 align:start position:0%
one is that she said if you don't pass
 
04:24:44.469 --> 04:24:44.479 align:start position:0%
this bill you might as well get rid of
 
04:24:47.349 --> 04:24:47.359 align:start position:0%
local zoning ordinances and just have a
 
04:24:49.670 --> 04:24:49.680 align:start position:0%
state ordinance for every town that is
 
04:24:51.349 --> 04:24:51.359 align:start position:0%
not what the housing appeals board is
 
04:24:53.590 --> 04:24:53.600 align:start position:0%
all about the housing appeals board does
 
04:24:57.269 --> 04:24:57.279 align:start position:0%
not create local ordinances it looks at
 
04:24:59.830 --> 04:24:59.840 align:start position:0%
local ordinances and it looks at
 
04:25:02.790 --> 04:25:02.800 align:start position:0%
existing state law and case law to make
 
04:25:05.349 --> 04:25:05.359 align:start position:0%
sure the decisions that were rendered
 
04:25:07.429 --> 04:25:07.439 align:start position:0%
at the local level were rendered
 
04:25:07.439 --> 04:25:09.990 align:start position:0%
at the local level were rendered
properly

04:25:09.990 --> 04:25:10.000 align:start position:0%
properly
 
04:25:12.149 --> 04:25:12.159 align:start position:0%
i also want to express a little bit of
 
04:25:13.670 --> 04:25:13.680 align:start position:0%
surprise with my friends from the
 
04:25:15.750 --> 04:25:15.760 align:start position:0%
municipal association
 
04:25:17.510 --> 04:25:17.520 align:start position:0%
supporting this bill and the reason why
 
04:25:17.520 --> 04:25:18.309 align:start position:0%
supporting this bill and the reason why
is

04:25:18.309 --> 04:25:18.319 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:25:20.469 --> 04:25:20.479 align:start position:0%
when this bill was being
 
04:25:23.830 --> 04:25:23.840 align:start position:0%
vetted discussed when it was conceptual
 
04:25:26.389 --> 04:25:26.399 align:start position:0%
the municipal association was very much
 
04:25:28.630 --> 04:25:28.640 align:start position:0%
a stakeholder in this bill now they did
 
04:25:31.110 --> 04:25:31.120 align:start position:0%
not support the legislation i should be
 
04:25:31.120 --> 04:25:32.070 align:start position:0%
not support the legislation i should be
clear

04:25:32.070 --> 04:25:32.080 align:start position:0%
clear
 
04:25:34.550 --> 04:25:34.560 align:start position:0%
but they did not oppose it either and i
 
04:25:35.990 --> 04:25:36.000 align:start position:0%
think part of the reason they didn't
 
04:25:37.990 --> 04:25:38.000 align:start position:0%
oppose it is we listened to their
 
04:25:38.000 --> 04:25:39.349 align:start position:0%
oppose it is we listened to their
concerns

04:25:39.349 --> 04:25:39.359 align:start position:0%
concerns
 
04:25:42.389 --> 04:25:42.399 align:start position:0%
and built language into the legislation
 
04:25:44.950 --> 04:25:44.960 align:start position:0%
that addressed their concerns
 
04:25:47.269 --> 04:25:47.279 align:start position:0%
i also think they recognized
 
04:25:49.830 --> 04:25:49.840 align:start position:0%
the benefit of the housing appeals board
 
04:25:51.910 --> 04:25:51.920 align:start position:0%
as also being a cost-saving measure for
 
04:25:53.670 --> 04:25:53.680 align:start position:0%
the town so they don't have to get
 
04:25:55.030 --> 04:25:55.040 align:start position:0%
dragged into
 
04:25:57.910 --> 04:25:57.920 align:start position:0%
costly time-consuming legislation
 
04:26:00.550 --> 04:26:00.560 align:start position:0%
nonetheless they are where they are
 
04:26:03.349 --> 04:26:03.359 align:start position:0%
i just want to make sure you understand
 
04:26:04.870 --> 04:26:04.880 align:start position:0%
the connection
 
04:26:07.349 --> 04:26:07.359 align:start position:0%
between housing and employers in your
 
04:26:07.359 --> 04:26:09.349 align:start position:0%
between housing and employers in your
communities

04:26:09.349 --> 04:26:09.359 align:start position:0%
communities
 
04:26:12.229 --> 04:26:12.239 align:start position:0%
housing is a public policy issue for
 
04:26:12.239 --> 04:26:14.309 align:start position:0%
housing is a public policy issue for
businesses

04:26:14.309 --> 04:26:14.319 align:start position:0%
businesses
 
04:26:17.030 --> 04:26:17.040 align:start position:0%
was not always on our radar screen i
 
04:26:20.550 --> 04:26:20.560 align:start position:0%
think it started developing around 2007
 
04:26:23.030 --> 04:26:23.040 align:start position:0%
2008 when we began hearing from our
 
04:26:23.040 --> 04:26:24.309 align:start position:0%
2008 when we began hearing from our
members

04:26:24.309 --> 04:26:24.319 align:start position:0%
members
 
04:26:27.670 --> 04:26:27.680 align:start position:0%
we're having a hard time hiring people
 
04:26:29.510 --> 04:26:29.520 align:start position:0%
not because the jobs aren't there and
 
04:26:31.670 --> 04:26:31.680 align:start position:0%
not because they don't want to work for
 
04:26:33.750 --> 04:26:33.760 align:start position:0%
us and not because the salary isn't what
 
04:26:35.349 --> 04:26:35.359 align:start position:0%
they're hoping to find
 
04:26:37.990 --> 04:26:38.000 align:start position:0%
we're having trouble hiring them because
 
04:26:40.469 --> 04:26:40.479 align:start position:0%
they can't find housing in our community
 
04:26:43.110 --> 04:26:43.120 align:start position:0%
so i would ask all of you to go back to
 
04:26:45.110 --> 04:26:45.120 align:start position:0%
the employers in your communities and
 
04:26:47.590 --> 04:26:47.600 align:start position:0%
ask them what is your experience right
 
04:26:50.550 --> 04:26:50.560 align:start position:0%
now hiring are you able to hire people
 
04:26:52.630 --> 04:26:52.640 align:start position:0%
and if the answer which i think you'll
 
04:26:54.790 --> 04:26:54.800 align:start position:0%
hear is we're having an extraordinarily
 
04:26:57.670 --> 04:26:57.680 align:start position:0%
difficult time hiring and it's impacting
 
04:27:00.710 --> 04:27:00.720 align:start position:0%
our ability to do business ask them if
 
04:27:02.630 --> 04:27:02.640 align:start position:0%
they think the amount of housing in
 
04:27:05.990 --> 04:27:06.000 align:start position:0%
their area is sufficient for the number
 
04:27:07.429 --> 04:27:07.439 align:start position:0%
of people that they need in their
 
04:27:09.990 --> 04:27:10.000 align:start position:0%
businesses is it sufficient for the
 
04:27:11.830 --> 04:27:11.840 align:start position:0%
teachers that your schools need is it
 
04:27:14.710 --> 04:27:14.720 align:start position:0%
sufficient for firefighters and police
 
04:27:17.030 --> 04:27:17.040 align:start position:0%
that your communities need i think
 
04:27:19.269 --> 04:27:19.279 align:start position:0%
you'll find out that the answer is no
 
04:27:21.030 --> 04:27:21.040 align:start position:0%
and this is why the housing appeals
 
04:27:23.349 --> 04:27:23.359 align:start position:0%
board is so important
 
04:27:25.110 --> 04:27:25.120 align:start position:0%
to uh
 
04:27:27.910 --> 04:27:27.920 align:start position:0%
allowing for appropriate housing
 
04:27:29.830 --> 04:27:29.840 align:start position:0%
development in communities where it is
 
04:27:31.750 --> 04:27:31.760 align:start position:0%
really needed miss chair thank you i'd

thank you mr chair thank you for taking
 
04:28:16.790 --> 04:28:16.800 align:start position:0%
my question
 
04:28:18.550 --> 04:28:18.560 align:start position:0%
you mentioned
 
04:28:23.510 --> 04:28:23.520 align:start position:0%
employees employers in our communities
 
04:28:26.070 --> 04:28:26.080 align:start position:0%
how would you characterize students of
 
04:28:28.790 --> 04:28:28.800 align:start position:0%
our universities we have universities
 
04:28:30.870 --> 04:28:30.880 align:start position:0%
where the students are coming housing is
 
04:28:32.389 --> 04:28:32.399 align:start position:0%
a big issue
 
04:28:34.389 --> 04:28:34.399 align:start position:0%
for them so
 
04:28:37.510 --> 04:28:37.520 align:start position:0%
you know university are as an employer
 
04:28:40.309 --> 04:28:40.319 align:start position:0%
as well as a business
 
04:28:41.590 --> 04:28:41.600 align:start position:0%
but the
 
04:28:44.469 --> 04:28:44.479 align:start position:0%
students are also
 
04:28:46.950 --> 04:28:46.960 align:start position:0%
how would you i mean that's impacting
 
04:28:49.189 --> 04:28:49.199 align:start position:0%
our state too it's a it's a good
 
04:28:50.790 --> 04:28:50.800 align:start position:0%
question i guess in the spirit of
 
04:28:52.309 --> 04:28:52.319 align:start position:0%
transparency i should say that the
 
04:28:54.389 --> 04:28:54.399 align:start position:0%
university system as an employer is a
 
04:28:56.149 --> 04:28:56.159 align:start position:0%
member of the bia
 
04:28:58.229 --> 04:28:58.239 align:start position:0%
um and they certainly
 
04:28:58.239 --> 04:28:59.510 align:start position:0%
um and they certainly
uh

04:28:59.510 --> 04:28:59.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:29:01.830 --> 04:29:01.840 align:start position:0%
could tell you better than i the housing
 
04:29:05.750 --> 04:29:05.760 align:start position:0%

challenges that students have
but

04:29:06.630 --> 04:29:06.640 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:29:09.189 --> 04:29:09.199 align:start position:0%
candidly i think it's an issue all
 
04:29:11.269 --> 04:29:11.279 align:start position:0%
around the state for communities
 
04:29:13.349 --> 04:29:13.359 align:start position:0%
cities larger cities and smaller
 
04:29:13.359 --> 04:29:15.670 align:start position:0%
cities larger cities and smaller
communities

04:29:15.670 --> 04:29:15.680 align:start position:0%
communities
 
04:29:17.670 --> 04:29:17.680 align:start position:0%
for employers to
 
04:29:19.189 --> 04:29:19.199 align:start position:0%
have the
 
04:29:21.590 --> 04:29:21.600 align:start position:0%
housing available within a reasonable
 
04:29:23.910 --> 04:29:23.920 align:start position:0%
commute from the workplace for for their
 
04:29:23.920 --> 04:29:31.429 align:start position:0%
commute from the workplace for for their
employees

04:29:31.429 --> 04:29:31.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:34.469 --> 04:29:34.479 align:start position:0%
sorry i didn't it didn't snap to it um
 
04:29:36.550 --> 04:29:36.560 align:start position:0%
with my earlier question but
 
04:29:39.269 --> 04:29:39.279 align:start position:0%
um on an earlier bill we heard today um
 
04:29:42.469 --> 04:29:42.479 align:start position:0%
we had testimony from mr stewart from um
 
04:29:44.070 --> 04:29:44.080 align:start position:0%
stay work play
 
04:29:46.389 --> 04:29:46.399 align:start position:0%
and i had asked him if
 
04:29:49.429 --> 04:29:49.439 align:start position:0%
um the the housing shortage which this
 
04:29:50.630 --> 04:29:50.640 align:start position:0%
bill would
 
04:29:52.469 --> 04:29:52.479 align:start position:0%
would affect um
 
04:29:54.389 --> 04:29:54.399 align:start position:0%
has been keeping businesses from
 
04:29:56.630 --> 04:29:56.640 align:start position:0%
considering relocation to new hampshire
 
04:30:00.070 --> 04:30:00.080 align:start position:0%
and he wasn't able to to answer that but
 
04:30:02.149 --> 04:30:02.159 align:start position:0%
you're probably in a position the bia
 
04:30:03.990 --> 04:30:04.000 align:start position:0%
where companies that are contemplating
 
04:30:05.750 --> 04:30:05.760 align:start position:0%
coming to new hampshire
 
04:30:08.309 --> 04:30:08.319 align:start position:0%
uh might consider that have you has that
 
04:30:10.550 --> 04:30:10.560 align:start position:0%
been part of your experience it has i
 
04:30:12.149 --> 04:30:12.159 align:start position:0%
would say
 
04:30:15.429 --> 04:30:15.439 align:start position:0%
first of all i think uh lack of
 
04:30:17.510 --> 04:30:17.520 align:start position:0%
available and affordable housing affects
 
04:30:20.389 --> 04:30:20.399 align:start position:0%
businesses of all size your specific
 
04:30:22.630 --> 04:30:22.640 align:start position:0%
question i think is
 
04:30:25.349 --> 04:30:25.359 align:start position:0%
being asked more by larger companies
 
04:30:26.950 --> 04:30:26.960 align:start position:0%
companies coming in for example i'll
 
04:30:28.710 --> 04:30:28.720 align:start position:0%
provide an example
 
04:30:31.269 --> 04:30:31.279 align:start position:0%
before fidelity investments came into
 
04:30:32.469 --> 04:30:32.479 align:start position:0%
the state
 
04:30:34.550 --> 04:30:34.560 align:start position:0%
uh you know they've got a huge campus in
 
04:30:36.630 --> 04:30:36.640 align:start position:0%
merrimack i'm a former merrimack
 
04:30:38.790 --> 04:30:38.800 align:start position:0%
resident and i was there when they came
 
04:30:38.800 --> 04:30:39.510 align:start position:0%
resident and i was there when they came
in

04:30:39.510 --> 04:30:39.520 align:start position:0%
in
 
04:30:41.030 --> 04:30:41.040 align:start position:0%
one of the questions they needed to
 
04:30:43.269 --> 04:30:43.279 align:start position:0%
answer because they have
 
04:30:44.710 --> 04:30:44.720 align:start position:0%
i don't know how many employees is but i
 
04:30:46.630 --> 04:30:46.640 align:start position:0%
believe it's well over a thousand
 
04:30:49.269 --> 04:30:49.279 align:start position:0%
is if if there was an adequate workforce
 
04:30:51.030 --> 04:30:51.040 align:start position:0%
in that area to
 
04:30:52.630 --> 04:30:52.640 align:start position:0%
to fill the number of jobs that they
 
04:30:54.550 --> 04:30:54.560 align:start position:0%
were going to be bringing in they
 
04:30:56.710 --> 04:30:56.720 align:start position:0%
decided the answer was yes but they came
 
04:30:58.389 --> 04:30:58.399 align:start position:0%
in at a time where
 
04:31:00.149 --> 04:31:00.159 align:start position:0%
um there was
 
04:31:03.030 --> 04:31:03.040 align:start position:0%
a little bit of a housing glut in in
 
04:31:04.710 --> 04:31:04.720 align:start position:0%
nevada we had a bit of a housing crash
 
04:31:06.070 --> 04:31:06.080 align:start position:0%
and that created a lot of open
 
04:31:07.269 --> 04:31:07.279 align:start position:0%
properties i
 
04:31:09.429 --> 04:31:09.439 align:start position:0%
remember when i moved to merrimack it
 
04:31:12.309 --> 04:31:12.319 align:start position:0%
was in 1992 i bought a
 
04:31:14.550 --> 04:31:14.560 align:start position:0%
four bedroom split level ranch in a very
 
04:31:16.309 --> 04:31:16.319 align:start position:0%
nice neighborhood for a hundred and ten
 
04:31:17.910 --> 04:31:17.920 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars i mean a price that you
 
04:31:20.710 --> 04:31:20.720 align:start position:0%
can't even imagine nowadays especially
 
04:31:22.550 --> 04:31:22.560 align:start position:0%
in southern new hampshire so it wasn't
 
04:31:24.229 --> 04:31:24.239 align:start position:0%
as huge an issue at the time the
 
04:31:27.590 --> 04:31:27.600 align:start position:0%
fidelity came in but it's the type of
 
04:31:30.309 --> 04:31:30.319 align:start position:0%
question that a lot of larger companies
 
04:31:32.070 --> 04:31:32.080 align:start position:0%
will answer can
 
04:31:33.750 --> 04:31:33.760 align:start position:0%
if we choose to move to new hampshire
 
04:31:35.429 --> 04:31:35.439 align:start position:0%
and there's a lot of positive reasons
 
04:31:36.950 --> 04:31:36.960 align:start position:0%
why they would want to
 
04:31:38.630 --> 04:31:38.640 align:start position:0%
but there are some negatives associated
 
04:31:40.469 --> 04:31:40.479 align:start position:0%
to it one of them is is there going to
 
04:31:42.630 --> 04:31:42.640 align:start position:0%
be sufficient housing for the number of
 
04:31:46.630 --> 04:31:46.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:48.710 --> 04:31:48.720 align:start position:0%

04:31:50.830 --> 04:31:50.840 align:start position:0%
