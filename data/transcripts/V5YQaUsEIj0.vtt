the New Hampshire judicial branches

and determined that this initiative is
 
00:18:32.990 --> 00:18:33.000 align:start position:0%
not presently appropriate
 
00:18:36.289 --> 00:18:36.299 align:start position:0%
in addition it was suggested it targeted
 
00:18:39.169 --> 00:18:39.179 align:start position:0%
judicial training in the state's coil
 
00:18:41.630 --> 00:18:41.640 align:start position:0%
land use principles May adequately
 
00:18:45.409 --> 00:18:45.419 align:start position:0%
address the concern which gave this Bill
 
00:18:48.590 --> 00:18:48.600 align:start position:0%
Gate which rise to this bill
 
00:18:51.110 --> 00:18:51.120 align:start position:0%
the vote was 14-5
 
00:18:53.990 --> 00:18:54.000 align:start position:0%
yet in February 23 of this year House
 
00:18:57.830 --> 00:18:57.840 align:start position:0%
Bill 347 an act to establishing a
 
00:19:00.230 --> 00:19:00.240 align:start position:0%

00:19:03.049 --> 00:19:03.059 align:start position:0%

Committee for a public hearing at the
 
00:19:09.049 --> 00:19:09.059 align:start position:0%
executive session the bill was ought to
 
00:19:12.950 --> 00:19:12.960 align:start position:0%
pass with an amendment 16-4
 
00:19:15.169 --> 00:19:15.179 align:start position:0%
these are the following things I feel
 
00:19:18.230 --> 00:19:18.240 align:start position:0%
wrong with this type of Bill
 
00:19:22.010 --> 00:19:22.020 align:start position:0%
under New Hampshire current law when a
 
00:19:24.470 --> 00:19:24.480 align:start position:0%
party disagrees with a decision
 
00:19:27.950 --> 00:19:27.960 align:start position:0%
regarding land use and the PO can be
 
00:19:30.529 --> 00:19:30.539 align:start position:0%
made to the Superior Court
 
00:19:32.990 --> 00:19:33.000 align:start position:0%
or to the New Hampshire housing appeals
 
00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:34.669 align:start position:0%
or to the New Hampshire housing appeals
board

00:19:34.669 --> 00:19:34.679 align:start position:0%
board
 
00:19:38.270 --> 00:19:38.280 align:start position:0%
if House Bill 347 is passed
 
00:19:40.810 --> 00:19:40.820 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire housing appeals board
 
00:19:44.270 --> 00:19:44.280 align:start position:0%
stays intact
 
00:19:47.450 --> 00:19:47.460 align:start position:0%
therefore designating a specific Justice
 
00:19:51.590 --> 00:19:51.600 align:start position:0%
to a spare area court for a for a court
 
00:19:55.990 --> 00:19:56.000 align:start position:0%
land use review docket is in my opinion
 
00:19:59.150 --> 00:19:59.160 align:start position:0%
layering government
 
00:20:01.490 --> 00:20:01.500 align:start position:0%
according to the testimony of the public
 
00:20:04.490 --> 00:20:04.500 align:start position:0%
Hearing in January the Superior Court
 
00:20:07.430 --> 00:20:07.440 align:start position:0%
had the deficit of three and a half
 
00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:09.890 align:start position:0%
had the deficit of three and a half
justices

00:20:09.890 --> 00:20:09.900 align:start position:0%
justices
 
00:20:12.770 --> 00:20:12.780 align:start position:0%
the estimated cost
 
00:20:15.590 --> 00:20:15.600 align:start position:0%
to add another Justice and the
 
00:20:18.470 --> 00:20:18.480 align:start position:0%
appropriate people to go along
 
00:20:20.870 --> 00:20:20.880 align:start position:0%
is approximately five hundred thousand
 
00:20:22.610 --> 00:20:22.620 align:start position:0%
dollars a year
 
00:20:26.450 --> 00:20:26.460 align:start position:0%
to me this is an ad added burden to the
 
00:20:28.909 --> 00:20:28.919 align:start position:0%
taxpayers and the bad money could be
 
00:20:32.210 --> 00:20:32.220 align:start position:0%
used better elsewhere
 
00:20:34.549 --> 00:20:34.559 align:start position:0%
one of the appealing parts to passing
 
00:20:38.029 --> 00:20:38.039 align:start position:0%
House Bill 340 to 7 is generally assumed
 
00:20:42.350 --> 00:20:42.360 align:start position:0%
it will speed up land use cases
 
00:20:44.510 --> 00:20:44.520 align:start position:0%
I have heard mentioned that presently
 
00:20:47.450 --> 00:20:47.460 align:start position:0%
land use cases typically can take three
 
00:20:51.470 --> 00:20:51.480 align:start position:0%
years or longer to reach a judgment
 
00:20:53.990 --> 00:20:54.000 align:start position:0%
I ask why
 
00:20:56.330 --> 00:20:56.340 align:start position:0%
as for example
 
00:20:59.409 --> 00:20:59.419 align:start position:0%

00:21:46.970 --> 00:21:46.980 align:start position:0%
with these laws already in place why do
 
00:21:49.250 --> 00:21:49.260 align:start position:0%
we need to designate an additional
 
00:21:52.730 --> 00:21:52.740 align:start position:0%
Justice in the Superior Court
 
00:21:57.710 --> 00:21:57.720 align:start position:0%
why are we designating land use
 
00:22:01.190 --> 00:22:01.200 align:start position:0%
over other significant aspects
 
00:22:03.830 --> 00:22:03.840 align:start position:0%
that may need priority like for example
 
00:22:06.710 --> 00:22:06.720 align:start position:0%
criminal cases
 
00:22:09.610 --> 00:22:09.620 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is not a home rule state
 
00:22:12.830 --> 00:22:12.840 align:start position:0%
and therefore local governments obtain
 
00:22:14.990 --> 00:22:15.000 align:start position:0%
all of their Authority
 
00:22:17.810 --> 00:22:17.820 align:start position:0%
to act on Planning and Zoning from the
 
00:22:17.820 --> 00:22:19.250 align:start position:0%

legislature

00:22:19.250 --> 00:22:19.260 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
00:22:22.310 --> 00:22:22.320 align:start position:0%
the legislature has spent years passing
 
00:22:25.190 --> 00:22:25.200 align:start position:0%
laws regarding zoning
 
00:22:29.630 --> 00:22:29.640 align:start position:0%
and now by passing House Bill 349 and
 
00:22:32.270 --> 00:22:32.280 align:start position:0%
adding another layer of government I ask
 
00:22:36.110 --> 00:22:36.120 align:start position:0%
are we taking away the rights of local
 
00:22:36.120 --> 00:22:37.850 align:start position:0%
are we taking away the rights of local
government

00:22:37.850 --> 00:22:37.860 align:start position:0%
government
 
00:22:41.930 --> 00:22:41.940 align:start position:0%
if local decisions are an issue
 
00:22:44.690 --> 00:22:44.700 align:start position:0%
why isn't the legislature requiring
 
00:22:47.450 --> 00:22:47.460 align:start position:0%
further training for board members in
 
00:22:49.130 --> 00:22:49.140 align:start position:0%
our local communities
 
00:22:52.669 --> 00:22:52.679 align:start position:0%
I ask that you vote no on ought to pass
 
00:22:56.990 --> 00:22:57.000 align:start position:0%
on health Bill 349. thank you
 
00:23:04.250 --> 00:23:04.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:06.890 --> 00:23:06.900 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker let me say first I
 
00:23:08.330 --> 00:23:08.340 align:start position:0%
think it's really important to
 
00:23:08.340 --> 00:23:09.070 align:start position:0%
think it's really important to
understand

00:23:09.070 --> 00:23:09.080 align:start position:0%
understand
 
00:23:13.789 --> 00:23:13.799 align:start position:0%
this bill makes no absolutely no
 
00:23:16.610 --> 00:23:16.620 align:start position:0%
substantive changes to the law of land
 
00:23:18.710 --> 00:23:18.720 align:start position:0%
use in New Hampshire whether this bill
 
00:23:21.950 --> 00:23:21.960 align:start position:0%
passes or not the substantive law of
 
00:23:24.230 --> 00:23:24.240 align:start position:0%
land use in New Hampshire remains
 
00:23:25.610 --> 00:23:25.620 align:start position:0%
exactly the same
 
00:23:27.890 --> 00:23:27.900 align:start position:0%
to rep to to respond to the previous
 
00:23:30.289 --> 00:23:30.299 align:start position:0%
speakers when she raised some some very
 
00:23:31.909 --> 00:23:31.919 align:start position:0%
valid questions I'm sure you may you may
 
00:23:33.350 --> 00:23:33.360 align:start position:0%
be thinking well what's the answer to
 
00:23:34.909 --> 00:23:34.919 align:start position:0%
that well here here is one of the
 
00:23:36.350 --> 00:23:36.360 align:start position:0%
primary answers
 
00:23:39.830 --> 00:23:39.840 align:start position:0%
the bill that was proposed last year did
 
00:23:42.470 --> 00:23:42.480 align:start position:0%
not specifically say that we were going
 
00:23:45.890 --> 00:23:45.900 align:start position:0%
to add a judge to the Superior Court to
 
00:23:47.810 --> 00:23:47.820 align:start position:0%
handle these kind of cases and so the
 
00:23:51.049 --> 00:23:51.059 align:start position:0%
argument was a valid argument wait a
 
00:23:52.250 --> 00:23:52.260 align:start position:0%
minute you're going to be taking those
 
00:23:53.930 --> 00:23:53.940 align:start position:0%
people are going to be the judges that
 
00:23:56.990 --> 00:23:57.000 align:start position:0%
are there now if you if you remove one
 
00:23:59.210 --> 00:23:59.220 align:start position:0%
of them to be the specialized judge for
 
00:24:00.890 --> 00:24:00.900 align:start position:0%
the land use docket that will be one
 
00:24:03.409 --> 00:24:03.419 align:start position:0%
less judge to handle all the other uh
 
00:24:06.289 --> 00:24:06.299 align:start position:0%
cases on the docket this bill Crea
 
00:24:08.570 --> 00:24:08.580 align:start position:0%
corrects that it specifically provides
 
00:24:11.390 --> 00:24:11.400 align:start position:0%
that there will be a new judge appointed
 
00:24:13.370 --> 00:24:13.380 align:start position:0%
to the land you stock it
 
00:24:16.070 --> 00:24:16.080 align:start position:0%
will be a new Superior Court judge and
 
00:24:20.750 --> 00:24:20.760 align:start position:0%
that the uh the uh the uh number of
 
00:24:22.789 --> 00:24:22.799 align:start position:0%
Superior Court judges will be increased
 
00:24:23.890 --> 00:24:23.900 align:start position:0%
by one
 
00:24:26.830 --> 00:24:26.840 align:start position:0%
another argument that was made is that
 
00:24:30.169 --> 00:24:30.179 align:start position:0%
somehow that there's a
 
00:24:32.810 --> 00:24:32.820 align:start position:0%
a problem with having a specialized
 
00:24:37.190 --> 00:24:37.200 align:start position:0%
judge to handle just these type of cases
 
00:24:39.590 --> 00:24:39.600 align:start position:0%
I submit to you that that the contrary
 
00:24:42.470 --> 00:24:42.480 align:start position:0%
is is in fact the case we have the
 
00:24:44.930 --> 00:24:44.940 align:start position:0%
experience and in fact this legislation
 
00:24:47.390 --> 00:24:47.400 align:start position:0%
was modeled after the business court
 
00:24:49.970 --> 00:24:49.980 align:start position:0%
docket model that that the business
 
00:24:52.730 --> 00:24:52.740 align:start position:0%
court docket has been in effect for
 
00:24:54.890 --> 00:24:54.900 align:start position:0%
about 15 years maybe a little bit less
 
00:24:56.630 --> 00:24:56.640 align:start position:0%
than that it was the Statute of
 
00:24:59.270 --> 00:24:59.280 align:start position:0%
authorizing it was passed when when John
 
00:25:01.310 --> 00:25:01.320 align:start position:0%
Lynch was the governor it has been
 
00:25:04.430 --> 00:25:04.440 align:start position:0%
immensely successful A specialized a
 
00:25:07.190 --> 00:25:07.200 align:start position:0%
single judge was specially appointed to
 
00:25:08.750 --> 00:25:08.760 align:start position:0%
the Superior Court to be the business
 
00:25:12.350 --> 00:25:12.360 align:start position:0%
court judge and fortunately we've had
 
00:25:14.750 --> 00:25:14.760 align:start position:0%
two great business Court judges the
 
00:25:16.610 --> 00:25:16.620 align:start position:0%
first one was Judge McNamara who served
 
00:25:19.190 --> 00:25:19.200 align:start position:0%
for over 10 years until he uh retired
 
00:25:21.649 --> 00:25:21.659 align:start position:0%
and now we have a judge Anderson who has
 
00:25:24.169 --> 00:25:24.179 align:start position:0%
replaced him I my
 
00:25:26.269 --> 00:25:26.279 align:start position:0%
from my knowledge of the legal community
 
00:25:28.669 --> 00:25:28.679 align:start position:0%
and the business Community everyone
 
00:25:30.950 --> 00:25:30.960 align:start position:0%
thinks that this is a this has been a a
 
00:25:32.930 --> 00:25:32.940 align:start position:0%
great benefit business cases have been
 
00:25:35.090 --> 00:25:35.100 align:start position:0%
moved along much quicker than they used
 
00:25:37.430 --> 00:25:37.440 align:start position:0%
to be and I think the same thing would
 
00:25:41.510 --> 00:25:41.520 align:start position:0%
happen here we do have a housing problem
 
00:25:45.529 --> 00:25:45.539 align:start position:0%
in this state and we have as as I think
 
00:25:47.870 --> 00:25:47.880 align:start position:0%
even the the prior speaker indicated we
 
00:25:50.810 --> 00:25:50.820 align:start position:0%
do have backlogs of cases even with the
 
00:25:52.909 --> 00:25:52.919 align:start position:0%
housing appeals board I this was frankly
 
00:25:55.250 --> 00:25:55.260 align:start position:0%
a surprise to me but we found out that
 
00:25:57.830 --> 00:25:57.840 align:start position:0%
even with the housing appeals board and
 
00:25:59.930 --> 00:25:59.940 align:start position:0%
the cases that they are getting
 
00:26:03.409 --> 00:26:03.419 align:start position:0%
the docket of of land use appeals cases
 
00:26:06.769 --> 00:26:06.779 align:start position:0%
in the superior court has not gone down
 
00:26:09.169 --> 00:26:09.179 align:start position:0%
um so there is and those cases are
 
00:26:11.630 --> 00:26:11.640 align:start position:0%
complicated they take many of them take
 
00:26:14.149 --> 00:26:14.159 align:start position:0%
a long time to resolve there's a huge
 
00:26:17.390 --> 00:26:17.400 align:start position:0%
record often of maps and diagrams and
 
00:26:19.789 --> 00:26:19.799 align:start position:0%
all kinds of things zoning ordinances
 
00:26:22.130 --> 00:26:22.140 align:start position:0%
are often very complicated and the
 
00:26:25.430 --> 00:26:25.440 align:start position:0%
problem now is that when you have when
 
00:26:27.409 --> 00:26:27.419 align:start position:0%
those are assigned as they are now to
 
00:26:31.549 --> 00:26:31.559 align:start position:0%
the to the general uh docket of the
 
00:26:34.010 --> 00:26:34.020 align:start position:0%
judges those judges have a lot of other
 
00:26:35.930 --> 00:26:35.940 align:start position:0%
things to do including particularly
 
00:26:37.669 --> 00:26:37.679 align:start position:0%
criminal cases which have to take
 
00:26:40.850 --> 00:26:40.860 align:start position:0%
priority so what happens is the judge
 
00:26:43.190 --> 00:26:43.200 align:start position:0%
will work on the case for an hour or two
 
00:26:45.649 --> 00:26:45.659 align:start position:0%
and then we'll be uh will be off to do
 
00:26:47.510 --> 00:26:47.520 align:start position:0%
something something else and maybe we'll
 
00:26:49.669 --> 00:26:49.679 align:start position:0%
get back to it you know a week later or
 
00:26:51.789 --> 00:26:51.799 align:start position:0%
two weeks later or maybe a month later
 
00:26:54.590 --> 00:26:54.600 align:start position:0%
which is is one reason that there's such
 
00:26:56.990 --> 00:26:57.000 align:start position:0%
that there's such a delay in having
 
00:26:59.510 --> 00:26:59.520 align:start position:0%
those K cases get out if you were
 
00:27:02.510 --> 00:27:02.520 align:start position:0%
console date the case before one judge
 
00:27:05.390 --> 00:27:05.400 align:start position:0%
whose only job will be to do the the
 
00:27:08.110 --> 00:27:08.120 align:start position:0%
land use cases it will
 
00:27:10.850 --> 00:27:10.860 align:start position:0%
streamline things a great deal as it has
 
00:27:13.490 --> 00:27:13.500 align:start position:0%
in the business Court context and this
 
00:27:15.590 --> 00:27:15.600 align:start position:0%
isn't going to be you know the solution
 
00:27:17.930 --> 00:27:17.940 align:start position:0%
to the housing problem we have in New
 
00:27:19.549 --> 00:27:19.559 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but it will move the ball
 
00:27:22.010 --> 00:27:22.020 align:start position:0%
forward significantly I think and it's
 
00:27:25.430 --> 00:27:25.440 align:start position:0%
for that reason that I asked you uh vote
 
00:27:27.110 --> 00:27:27.120 align:start position:0%
to approve this Bill thank you Mr
 
00:27:27.120 --> 00:27:31.310 align:start position:0%

the question before us is the
 
00:27:52.010 --> 00:27:52.020 align:start position:0%
motion of ought to pass with Amendment
 
00:27:53.870 --> 00:27:53.880 align:start position:0%

legislate instead of John Cloutier for
 
00:28:32.990 --> 00:28:33.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:35.450 --> 00:28:35.460 align:start position:0%

00:29:18.529 --> 00:29:18.539 align:start position:0%
recommendation
 
00:29:21.169 --> 00:29:21.179 align:start position:0%
representative Kaplan is who he uh is
 
00:29:24.769 --> 00:29:24.779 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:29.110 --> 00:29:29.120 align:start position:0%
representative Bernardi is moving itl
 
00:29:32.389 --> 00:29:32.399 align:start position:0%
recognized to speak against the auto
 
00:29:37.970 --> 00:29:37.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:40.070 --> 00:29:40.080 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
00:29:45.169 --> 00:29:45.179 align:start position:0%
passage of HB 234 would increase costs
 
00:29:47.570 --> 00:29:47.580 align:start position:0%
to Electric rate payers in New Hampshire
 
00:29:51.169 --> 00:29:51.179 align:start position:0%
by about 3 million dollars a year
 
00:29:52.669 --> 00:29:52.679 align:start position:0%
why is this
 
00:29:56.810 --> 00:29:56.820 align:start position:0%
utilities are required to make
 
00:29:59.090 --> 00:29:59.100 align:start position:0%
renewable or to purchase renewable
 
00:30:02.570 --> 00:30:02.580 align:start position:0%
energy credits or to buy alternative
 
00:30:05.570 --> 00:30:05.580 align:start position:0%
compliance payments
 
00:30:08.870 --> 00:30:08.880 align:start position:0%
credits or payments
 
00:30:11.810 --> 00:30:11.820 align:start position:0%
what can they do right now they can buy
 
00:30:15.190 --> 00:30:15.200 align:start position:0%
credits from from renewable
 
00:30:17.690 --> 00:30:17.700 align:start position:0%
providers that have done the paperwork
 
00:30:20.450 --> 00:30:20.460 align:start position:0%
to create the credits
 
00:30:23.210 --> 00:30:23.220 align:start position:0%
or the law also provides and what this
 
00:30:27.230 --> 00:30:27.240 align:start position:0%
bill attempts to repeal is they can
 
00:30:30.230 --> 00:30:30.240 align:start position:0%
sweep credits from those
 
00:30:32.750 --> 00:30:32.760 align:start position:0%
renewable providers who have not done
 
00:30:35.690 --> 00:30:35.700 align:start position:0%
the paperwork to create a credit
 
00:30:38.930 --> 00:30:38.940 align:start position:0%
I'm one of those folks I have a solar
 
00:30:41.330 --> 00:30:41.340 align:start position:0%
tower in my backyard with 24 panels on
 
00:30:45.289 --> 00:30:45.299 align:start position:0%
it you may have a rooftop solar system
 
00:30:47.990 --> 00:30:48.000 align:start position:0%
you don't fill out the paperwork to get
 
00:30:51.409 --> 00:30:51.419 align:start position:0%
a few dollars worth of credit but the
 
00:30:55.070 --> 00:30:55.080 align:start position:0%
utilities can sweep those credits claim
 
00:30:55.080 --> 00:30:56.870 align:start position:0%
utilities can sweep those credits claim
them

00:30:56.870 --> 00:30:56.880 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:31:01.909 --> 00:31:01.919 align:start position:0%
in in their need to satisfy how many
 
00:31:04.190 --> 00:31:04.200 align:start position:0%
credits they need to buy or if they
 
00:31:06.409 --> 00:31:06.419 align:start position:0%
can't find those credits
 
00:31:08.750 --> 00:31:08.760 align:start position:0%
they have to make alternative compliance
 
00:31:08.760 --> 00:31:10.010 align:start position:0%
they have to make alternative compliance
payments

00:31:10.010 --> 00:31:10.020 align:start position:0%
payments
 
00:31:12.230 --> 00:31:12.240 align:start position:0%
the credits are cheaper
 
00:31:14.810 --> 00:31:14.820 align:start position:0%
the alternative compliance payments are
 
00:31:18.529 --> 00:31:18.539 align:start position:0%
more expensive if this bill passes the
 
00:31:21.110 --> 00:31:21.120 align:start position:0%
ability to sweep those credits is taken
 
00:31:21.120 --> 00:31:22.370 align:start position:0%
ability to sweep those credits is taken
away

00:31:22.370 --> 00:31:22.380 align:start position:0%
away
 
00:31:25.190 --> 00:31:25.200 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire will have a rate increase
 
00:31:27.830 --> 00:31:27.840 align:start position:0%
across the board of about three million
 
00:31:29.210 --> 00:31:29.220 align:start position:0%
dollars a year
 
00:31:31.250 --> 00:31:31.260 align:start position:0%

the renewable portfolio standard or RPS
 
00:31:48.169 --> 00:31:48.179 align:start position:0%
is New Hampshire's primary measure
 
00:31:50.870 --> 00:31:50.880 align:start position:0%
promoting renewable energy its goal is
 
00:31:53.149 --> 00:31:53.159 align:start position:0%
clear to increase the availability and
 
00:31:55.010 --> 00:31:55.020 align:start position:0%
use of renewable energy in New Hampshire
 
00:31:57.529 --> 00:31:57.539 align:start position:0%
to diversify our fuel sources away from
 
00:32:00.590 --> 00:32:00.600 align:start position:0%
over-reliance on costly dirty fossil
 
00:32:02.450 --> 00:32:02.460 align:start position:0%

put it in a nutshell the renewable
 
00:33:11.269 --> 00:33:11.279 align:start position:0%
portfolio standard was enacted in 2007
 
00:33:13.909 --> 00:33:13.919 align:start position:0%
to incentivize renewable energy in order
 
00:33:16.730 --> 00:33:16.740 align:start position:0%
to diversify our sources of electric
 
00:33:19.490 --> 00:33:19.500 align:start position:0%

Independence on fossil fuels and thus
 
00:33:23.870 --> 00:33:23.880 align:start position:0%
drive down electricity costs for New

disgraceful spikes in electric rates due
 
00:33:33.289 --> 00:33:33.299 align:start position:0%
to our continued Reliance on natural gas
 
00:33:34.970 --> 00:33:34.980 align:start position:0%
it's all the more important to
 
00:33:37.130 --> 00:33:37.140 align:start position:0%
strengthen the renewable portfolio
 
00:33:39.409 --> 00:33:39.419 align:start position:0%
programs designed to diversify our
 
00:33:43.370 --> 00:33:43.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:47.149 --> 00:33:47.159 align:start position:0%
HB 234 is intended
 
00:33:49.789 --> 00:33:49.799 align:start position:0%
to remove a loophole where the public
 
00:33:51.710 --> 00:33:51.720 align:start position:0%
distribution utilities and competitive
 
00:33:54.230 --> 00:33:54.240 align:start position:0%
electricity suppliers in our state are
 
00:33:56.630 --> 00:33:56.640 align:start position:0%
relieved of their obligation to meet
 
00:33:59.389 --> 00:33:59.399 align:start position:0%
their annual targets enacted in 2007 by
 
00:34:01.070 --> 00:34:01.080 align:start position:0%
the general court the renewable
 
00:34:02.870 --> 00:34:02.880 align:start position:0%
portfolio standard requires our
 
00:34:04.970 --> 00:34:04.980 align:start position:0%
utilities to purchase a percentage of
 
00:34:07.070 --> 00:34:07.080 align:start position:0%
their power through renewable energy
 
00:34:10.250 --> 00:34:10.260 align:start position:0%
credits or wrecks that accrue
 
00:34:12.349 --> 00:34:12.359 align:start position:0%
automatically to all renewable energy
 
00:34:15.589 --> 00:34:15.599 align:start position:0%
producers but the loophole in F6 section
 
00:34:18.349 --> 00:34:18.359 align:start position:0%
2A which is being repealed by this bill
 
00:34:21.109 --> 00:34:21.119 align:start position:0%
allows the utilities to claim the wrecks
 
00:34:23.990 --> 00:34:24.000 align:start position:0%
that have not been officially filed
 
00:34:26.089 --> 00:34:26.099 align:start position:0%
the majority of these belong to
 
00:34:27.950 --> 00:34:27.960 align:start position:0%
residential solar customers like the
 
00:34:30.109 --> 00:34:30.119 align:start position:0%
previous speaker who have not filed the
 
00:34:32.690 --> 00:34:32.700 align:start position:0%
onerous and time-consuming paperwork to
 
00:34:34.609 --> 00:34:34.619 align:start position:0%
receive the official Rec certificates
 
00:34:36.829 --> 00:34:36.839 align:start position:0%
which they could then turn around and
 
00:34:38.990 --> 00:34:39.000 align:start position:0%
sell if they so chose
 
00:34:41.210 --> 00:34:41.220 align:start position:0%
by not notifying these renewable
 
00:34:42.950 --> 00:34:42.960 align:start position:0%
producers of their rightful claim to
 
00:34:45.349 --> 00:34:45.359 align:start position:0%
their wrecks and sweeping up these
 
00:34:47.149 --> 00:34:47.159 align:start position:0%
unregistered wrecks the utilities and
 
00:34:49.669 --> 00:34:49.679 align:start position:0%
private companies are claiming millions
 
00:34:52.250 --> 00:34:52.260 align:start position:0%
of dollars that rightfully belong to
 
00:34:54.710 --> 00:34:54.720 align:start position:0%
private citizens in effect a private
 
00:34:57.109 --> 00:34:57.119 align:start position:0%
property taken taking which is a polite
 
00:34:59.690 --> 00:34:59.700 align:start position:0%
way of saying robbery
 
00:35:01.970 --> 00:35:01.980 align:start position:0%
the argument in favor of continuing with
 
00:35:04.430 --> 00:35:04.440 align:start position:0%
this loophole is both disingenuous and
 
00:35:06.530 --> 00:35:06.540 align:start position:0%
plain wrong on two levels
 
00:35:08.390 --> 00:35:08.400 align:start position:0%
the proponent s of so-called Rex
 
00:35:10.609 --> 00:35:10.619 align:start position:0%
sweeping by the utilities will say that
 
00:35:12.530 --> 00:35:12.540 align:start position:0%
if the utilities are not allowed to take
 
00:35:14.990 --> 00:35:15.000 align:start position:0%
this free money then they will pay off
 
00:35:16.609 --> 00:35:16.619 align:start position:0%
the cost of complying with their
 
00:35:19.010 --> 00:35:19.020 align:start position:0%
obligation the purchase wrecks by
 
00:35:20.630 --> 00:35:20.640 align:start position:0%
passing along these costs to their
 
00:35:22.670 --> 00:35:22.680 align:start position:0%
customers in other words raising their
 
00:35:22.680 --> 00:35:23.690 align:start position:0%
customers in other words raising their
rates

00:35:23.690 --> 00:35:23.700 align:start position:0%
rates
 
00:35:25.730 --> 00:35:25.740 align:start position:0%
so that's blackmail but even if we
 
00:35:27.710 --> 00:35:27.720 align:start position:0%
ignore that and Grant that for the sake
 
00:35:30.410 --> 00:35:30.420 align:start position:0%
of arguments it benefits rate payers to
 
00:35:32.750 --> 00:35:32.760 align:start position:0%
continue with wreck sweeping if you are
 
00:35:34.790 --> 00:35:34.800 align:start position:0%
robbing Peter to pay Paul it's still
 
00:35:37.430 --> 00:35:37.440 align:start position:0%
robbery even if it benefits Paul
 
00:35:39.890 --> 00:35:39.900 align:start position:0%
as rate payers we will bend to this
 
00:35:41.450 --> 00:35:41.460 align:start position:0%
blackmail and stand with Paul but it
 
00:35:44.270 --> 00:35:44.280 align:start position:0%
behooves us as private citizens in a
 
00:35:46.310 --> 00:35:46.320 align:start position:0%
law-abiding Society to stand with Peter
 
00:35:49.970 --> 00:35:49.980 align:start position:0%
and say that this practice must end
 
00:35:52.010 --> 00:35:52.020 align:start position:0%
the other way
 
00:35:53.810 --> 00:35:53.820 align:start position:0%
this is wrong is the fallacy of
 
00:35:55.790 --> 00:35:55.800 align:start position:0%
short-term thinking that denies the
 
00:35:58.670 --> 00:35:58.680 align:start position:0%
effect of incentivizing a more diverse
 
00:36:01.370 --> 00:36:01.380 align:start position:0%
mix of electric generation sources the
 
00:36:04.310 --> 00:36:04.320 align:start position:0%
aim of the renewable portfolio standard
 
00:36:06.290 --> 00:36:06.300 align:start position:0%
and the renewable energy certificates
 
00:36:09.170 --> 00:36:09.180 align:start position:0%
that are the monetary backbone of the
 
00:36:11.150 --> 00:36:11.160 align:start position:0%
whole mechanism by allowing the
 
00:36:12.950 --> 00:36:12.960 align:start position:0%
utilities and generators to make an end
 
00:36:15.470 --> 00:36:15.480 align:start position:0%
run around compliance the value of the
 
00:36:17.630 --> 00:36:17.640 align:start position:0%
Rex is cheapened lessening the incentive
 
00:36:19.790 --> 00:36:19.800 align:start position:0%
and The Leverage power to bring on more
 
00:36:22.130 --> 00:36:22.140 align:start position:0%
renewable energy production which lowers
 
00:36:24.190 --> 00:36:24.200 align:start position:0%
demand for more expensive natural gas
 
00:36:28.190 --> 00:36:28.200 align:start position:0%
and thus lowers rates in the long term
 
00:36:29.810 --> 00:36:29.820 align:start position:0%
unfortunately our department of energy
 
00:36:32.329 --> 00:36:32.339 align:start position:0%
seems to fall into this bottleneck and
 
00:36:34.250 --> 00:36:34.260 align:start position:0%
blinkered point of view by adopting in
 
00:36:35.810 --> 00:36:35.820 align:start position:0%
their fiscal note accompanying the bill
 
00:36:37.849 --> 00:36:37.859 align:start position:0%
the point of view of rate payer costs
 
00:36:39.470 --> 00:36:39.480 align:start position:0%
alone and not assuming the costs and
 
00:36:41.569 --> 00:36:41.579 align:start position:0%
benefits that would accrue to the entire
 
00:36:43.069 --> 00:36:43.079 align:start position:0%
state and its people from a
 
00:36:45.050 --> 00:36:45.060 align:start position:0%
full-throated defense of the renewable
 
00:36:47.690 --> 00:36:47.700 align:start position:0%
portfolio standard and its aims but as
 
00:36:50.210 --> 00:36:50.220 align:start position:0%
legislators we must remember that we
 
00:36:51.710 --> 00:36:51.720 align:start position:0%
represent the state of New Hampshire and
 
00:36:54.410 --> 00:36:54.420 align:start position:0%
its citizens not the rate payers of New
 
00:36:56.270 --> 00:36:56.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire which is a thinly veiled way
 
00:36:58.250 --> 00:36:58.260 align:start position:0%
of saying the public utilities and
 
00:37:00.109 --> 00:37:00.119 align:start position:0%
private out-of-state electricity
 
00:37:02.510 --> 00:37:02.520 align:start position:0%
suppliers of New Hampshire
 
00:37:04.730 --> 00:37:04.740 align:start position:0%
the fact is that any short-term impact
 
00:37:06.530 --> 00:37:06.540 align:start position:0%
to rate payers would amount to Pennies
 
00:37:09.050 --> 00:37:09.060 align:start position:0%
on a monthly bill contrast that with
 
00:37:10.670 --> 00:37:10.680 align:start position:0%
what we all lose
 
00:37:12.950 --> 00:37:12.960 align:start position:0%
a faster transition to local renewable
 
00:37:14.870 --> 00:37:14.880 align:start position:0%
sources which will keep billions of
 
00:37:17.030 --> 00:37:17.040 align:start position:0%
dollars in our State feeding our economy
 
00:37:19.130 --> 00:37:19.140 align:start position:0%
in a virtuous cycle of Greater
 
00:37:22.310 --> 00:37:22.320 align:start position:0%
investment more jobs and cleaner air
 
00:37:24.290 --> 00:37:24.300 align:start position:0%
the elephant in the room is the climate
 
00:37:26.329 --> 00:37:26.339 align:start position:0%
emergency we're in that is forcing our
 
00:37:28.310 --> 00:37:28.320 align:start position:0%
hand on the transition to cleaner
 
00:37:28.320 --> 00:37:29.450 align:start position:0%
hand on the transition to cleaner
generation

00:37:29.450 --> 00:37:29.460 align:start position:0%
generation
 
00:37:31.910 --> 00:37:31.920 align:start position:0%
it's an existential threat that demands
 
00:37:34.609 --> 00:37:34.619 align:start position:0%
to be treated as such the intent of the
 
00:37:36.050 --> 00:37:36.060 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire renewable portfolio
 
00:37:38.510 --> 00:37:38.520 align:start position:0%
standards to provide an incentivizing
 
00:37:41.270 --> 00:37:41.280 align:start position:0%
mechanism for that transition and this
 
00:37:44.990 --> 00:37:45.000 align:start position:0%
bill HB 234 seeks to strengthen the
 
00:37:47.390 --> 00:37:47.400 align:start position:0%
mechanism by removing the loophole that
 
00:37:49.670 --> 00:37:49.680 align:start position:0%
is stealing from New Hampshire citizens
 
00:37:52.069 --> 00:37:52.079 align:start position:0%
and harming us all so please join me in
 
00:37:58.510 --> 00:37:58.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:00.770 --> 00:38:00.780 align:start position:0%
and I call for a division vote Mr
 
00:38:00.780 --> 00:38:03.170 align:start position:0%
and I call for a division vote Mr
Speaker

00:38:03.170 --> 00:38:03.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:05.390 --> 00:38:05.400 align:start position:0%
division vote
 
00:38:07.370 --> 00:38:07.380 align:start position:0%
the division has been requested members
 
00:38:09.829 --> 00:38:09.839 align:start position:0%
will take your seats
 
00:38:11.930 --> 00:38:11.940 align:start position:0%
a roll call has been requested who
 
00:38:15.710 --> 00:38:15.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:18.050 --> 00:38:18.060 align:start position:0%
is that sufficiently seconded it is
 
00:38:20.329 --> 00:38:20.339 align:start position:0%
sufficiently seconded this this will be
 
00:39:11.930 --> 00:39:11.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:14.810 --> 00:39:14.820 align:start position:0%
I also come to water
 
00:39:17.630 --> 00:39:17.640 align:start position:0%
the question before us is the underpass
 
00:39:20.510 --> 00:39:20.520 align:start position:0%
motion on House Bill 234 it's the roll
 
00:39:22.609 --> 00:39:22.619 align:start position:0%
call vote chair recognizes
 
00:39:24.530 --> 00:39:24.540 align:start position:0%
representative votes for a parliamentary
 
00:39:24.540 --> 00:39:35.089 align:start position:0%
representative votes for a parliamentary
inquiry

00:39:35.089 --> 00:39:35.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:37.550 --> 00:39:37.560 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
00:39:39.530 --> 00:39:39.540 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker if I know that this bill
 
00:39:42.470 --> 00:39:42.480 align:start position:0%
would increase electricity costs by 30
 
00:39:46.190 --> 00:39:46.200 align:start position:0%
million dollars in the next 10 years
 
00:39:48.230 --> 00:39:48.240 align:start position:0%
and if I also know that this bill seeks
 
00:39:50.390 --> 00:39:50.400 align:start position:0%
to repeal a law that was passed
 
00:39:53.810 --> 00:39:53.820 align:start position:0%
specifically to prevent an additional
 
00:39:58.190 --> 00:39:58.200 align:start position:0%
expense that produces no further benefit
 
00:40:01.670 --> 00:40:01.680 align:start position:0%
a failure of the cost benefit test
 
00:40:03.470 --> 00:40:03.480 align:start position:0%
and finally if I know that the original
 
00:40:06.410 --> 00:40:06.420 align:start position:0%
law has served our well served our state
 
00:40:09.170 --> 00:40:09.180 align:start position:0%
well over the past Dozen Years and was
 
00:40:11.569 --> 00:40:11.579 align:start position:0%
opposed by the department of energy
 
00:40:13.970 --> 00:40:13.980 align:start position:0%
what I now press the red button to
 
00:40:16.130 --> 00:40:16.140 align:start position:0%
protect our wallets and our paychecks
 
00:40:18.230 --> 00:40:18.240 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
00:40:20.630 --> 00:40:20.640 align:start position:0%
before we get on to the next one uh make
 
00:40:22.190 --> 00:40:22.200 align:start position:0%
sure everybody turns your voting station
 
00:40:24.109 --> 00:40:24.119 align:start position:0%
on so you can vote
 
00:40:25.730 --> 00:40:25.740 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes representative
 
00:40:28.430 --> 00:40:28.440 align:start position:0%
McWilliams for parliamentary inquiry
 
00:40:31.670 --> 00:40:31.680 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker if I know that this
 
00:40:34.670 --> 00:40:34.680 align:start position:0%
bill would make utilities actually meet
 
00:40:36.470 --> 00:40:36.480 align:start position:0%
their renewable portfolio standard
 
00:40:39.349 --> 00:40:39.359 align:start position:0%
instead of cheating on the backs of New
 
00:40:41.810 --> 00:40:41.820 align:start position:0%
Hampshire residents who have solar and
 
00:40:43.250 --> 00:40:43.260 align:start position:0%
have not gone through the arduous
 
00:40:45.950 --> 00:40:45.960 align:start position:0%
process of registering that solar
 
00:40:48.950 --> 00:40:48.960 align:start position:0%
which is in effect a taking of private
 
00:40:51.290 --> 00:40:51.300 align:start position:0%
property and giving to large
 
00:40:53.810 --> 00:40:53.820 align:start position:0%
out-of-state corporations who don't
 
00:40:55.670 --> 00:40:55.680 align:start position:0%
really need the money but are getting it
 
00:40:58.370 --> 00:40:58.380 align:start position:0%
because we've enabled that would I then
 
00:41:02.270 --> 00:41:02.280 align:start position:0%
vote Yes to close this loophole thank
 
00:41:04.490 --> 00:41:04.500 align:start position:0%
you Mr Speaker
 
00:41:06.530 --> 00:41:06.540 align:start position:0%
the question before us is the auto pass
 
00:41:09.170 --> 00:41:09.180 align:start position:0%
motion on House Bill 234 this is a roll
 
00:41:11.030 --> 00:41:11.040 align:start position:0%
call vote if you're in favor you'll

fuels now and in the future
 
00:54:23.450 --> 00:54:23.460 align:start position:0%
according to the New Hampshire
 
00:54:25.609 --> 00:54:25.619 align:start position:0%
Department of energy the current
 
00:54:27.290 --> 00:54:27.300 align:start position:0%
available balance in the renewable
 
00:54:30.410 --> 00:54:30.420 align:start position:0%
energy fund is 7.8 million dollars the
 
00:54:31.970 --> 00:54:31.980 align:start position:0%
annual contributions to it are
 
00:54:34.970 --> 00:54:34.980 align:start position:0%
approximately 4.6 million dollars not
 
00:54:36.829 --> 00:54:36.839 align:start position:0%
the seven or eight million quoted in the
 
00:54:38.630 --> 00:54:38.640 align:start position:0%
statement in support of the ought to
 
00:54:41.030 --> 00:54:41.040 align:start position:0%
pass with Amendment
 
00:54:43.069 --> 00:54:43.079 align:start position:0%
the proponents of this bill would have
 
00:54:45.950 --> 00:54:45.960 align:start position:0%
us believe that rebating these funds to
 
00:54:47.930 --> 00:54:47.940 align:start position:0%
the electric consumer customers in our
 
00:54:50.809 --> 00:54:50.819 align:start position:0%
state will have a significant impact on
 
00:54:53.450 --> 00:54:53.460 align:start position:0%
their monthly cost of electricity
 
00:54:58.069 --> 00:54:58.079 align:start position:0%
according to doe there are 735 700
 
00:55:00.530 --> 00:55:00.540 align:start position:0%
electric customers in New Hampshire
 
00:55:02.390 --> 00:55:02.400 align:start position:0%
rebating the funds in the renewable
 
00:55:05.030 --> 00:55:05.040 align:start position:0%
energy funds to those consumers would
 
00:55:08.870 --> 00:55:08.880 align:start position:0%
result in at most a one dollar and forty
 
00:55:11.450 --> 00:55:11.460 align:start position:0%
Cent per month production in average
 
00:55:14.109 --> 00:55:14.119 align:start position:0%
consumer electricity bills in year one
 
00:55:18.109 --> 00:55:18.119 align:start position:0%
and 52 cents per month reduction in
 
00:55:19.910 --> 00:55:19.920 align:start position:0%
years thereafter
 
00:55:22.069 --> 00:55:22.079 align:start position:0%
those of us who oppose this bill know
 
00:55:24.170 --> 00:55:24.180 align:start position:0%
that the people of New Hampshire are
 
00:55:26.990 --> 00:55:27.000 align:start position:0%
smart enough to realize that a rebate of
 
00:55:31.609 --> 00:55:31.619 align:start position:0%
52 cents or even 1.40 cents per month
 
00:55:33.530 --> 00:55:33.540 align:start position:0%
will not make a big difference in their
 
00:55:35.750 --> 00:55:35.760 align:start position:0%
monthly budget and it is extremely
 
00:55:37.730 --> 00:55:37.740 align:start position:0%
short-sighted when it comes to our
 
00:55:40.490 --> 00:55:40.500 align:start position:0%
long-term economic future
 
00:55:41.990 --> 00:55:42.000 align:start position:0%
the people of New Hampshire understand
 
00:55:44.450 --> 00:55:44.460 align:start position:0%
that to reduce the cost of electricity
 
00:55:47.569 --> 00:55:47.579 align:start position:0%
in the long term we need to diversify
 
00:55:49.370 --> 00:55:49.380 align:start position:0%
our energy sources
 
00:55:51.349 --> 00:55:51.359 align:start position:0%
just like you would diversify your
 
00:55:53.930 --> 00:55:53.940 align:start position:0%
financial investments and reduce our
 
00:55:56.030 --> 00:55:56.040 align:start position:0%
independence on fossil fuels such as
 
00:55:57.470 --> 00:55:57.480 align:start position:0%
Natural Gas
 
00:55:59.809 --> 00:55:59.819 align:start position:0%
the only way to do that is to continue
 
00:56:02.690 --> 00:56:02.700 align:start position:0%
to invest in alternative sources of
 
00:56:02.700 --> 00:56:03.710 align:start position:0%
to invest in alternative sources of
energy

00:56:03.710 --> 00:56:03.720 align:start position:0%
energy
 
00:56:06.589 --> 00:56:06.599 align:start position:0%
if we had done that consistently since
 
00:56:08.690 --> 00:56:08.700 align:start position:0%
the renewable portfolio portfolio
 
00:56:11.990 --> 00:56:12.000 align:start position:0%
Standards Law was enacted in 2007 we
 
00:56:13.609 --> 00:56:13.619 align:start position:0%
would be much in a much better position
 
00:56:16.250 --> 00:56:16.260 align:start position:0%
than we are currently
 
00:56:17.990 --> 00:56:18.000 align:start position:0%
there are other ways to lessen the
 
00:56:20.150 --> 00:56:20.160 align:start position:0%
impact of high electricity prices in the
 
00:56:21.170 --> 00:56:21.180 align:start position:0%
short term
 
00:56:24.410 --> 00:56:24.420 align:start position:0%
now is exactly not the time however to
 
00:56:26.569 --> 00:56:26.579 align:start position:0%
cut back on our investments to encourage
 
00:56:28.609 --> 00:56:28.619 align:start position:0%
and support the development of
 
00:56:30.950 --> 00:56:30.960 align:start position:0%
alternative energy projects
 
00:56:33.410 --> 00:56:33.420 align:start position:0%
to do so would be Pennywise and pound
 
00:56:36.109 --> 00:56:36.119 align:start position:0%
foolish I encourage you to vote no on
 
00:56:38.270 --> 00:56:38.280 align:start position:0%
the motion of ought to pass with
 
00:56:42.530 --> 00:56:42.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:45.290 --> 00:56:45.300 align:start position:0%
Jay I recognizes representative naughter
 
00:56:47.089 --> 00:56:47.099 align:start position:0%
and I request the division vote Mr
 
00:56:52.069 --> 00:56:52.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:54.589 --> 00:56:54.599 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker Happy Valentine's
 
00:56:56.569 --> 00:56:56.579 align:start position:0%
Day by the end of all these reports
 
00:56:58.430 --> 00:56:58.440 align:start position:0%
you're all going to know all about Rex
 
00:57:04.130 --> 00:57:04.140 align:start position:0%
our ECS RPS acpuc and ref so take notes
 
00:57:07.670 --> 00:57:07.680 align:start position:0%
I rise in support of house bill 246. to
 
00:57:09.410 --> 00:57:09.420 align:start position:0%
put it simply it will lower the cost of
 
00:57:11.690 --> 00:57:11.700 align:start position:0%
electricity by rebating to rate payers
 
00:57:13.910 --> 00:57:13.920 align:start position:0%
the funds accumulated in the renewable
 
00:57:16.609 --> 00:57:16.619 align:start position:0%
energy fund ref
 
00:57:19.370 --> 00:57:19.380 align:start position:0%
to explain right now utilities are
 
00:57:21.950 --> 00:57:21.960 align:start position:0%
required by law to buy renewable energy
 
00:57:25.549 --> 00:57:25.559 align:start position:0%
certificates or Rex the wrecks are proof
 
00:57:27.349 --> 00:57:27.359 align:start position:0%
that energy has been generated from
 
00:57:30.349 --> 00:57:30.359 align:start position:0%
sources such as solar wind or Hydro
 
00:57:32.270 --> 00:57:32.280 align:start position:0%
the said energy is sent to the
 
00:57:33.710 --> 00:57:33.720 align:start position:0%
electrical grid
 
00:57:35.930 --> 00:57:35.940 align:start position:0%
utilities have to buy their wrecks to
 
00:57:38.270 --> 00:57:38.280 align:start position:0%
meet their renewable portfolio standard
 
00:57:38.280 --> 00:57:40.130 align:start position:0%
meet their renewable portfolio standard
RPS

00:57:40.130 --> 00:57:40.140 align:start position:0%
RPS
 
00:57:42.829 --> 00:57:42.839 align:start position:0%
the RPS is a mandate that a portion of
 
00:57:45.049 --> 00:57:45.059 align:start position:0%
generated power must come from sources
 
00:57:47.390 --> 00:57:47.400 align:start position:0%
such as solarwind or Hydro
 
00:57:49.790 --> 00:57:49.800 align:start position:0%
if the electrical supplier fails to meet
 
00:57:52.609 --> 00:57:52.619 align:start position:0%
their RPS requirements by securing the
 
00:57:55.309 --> 00:57:55.319 align:start position:0%
necessary wrecks they must pay a penalty
 
00:57:57.650 --> 00:57:57.660 align:start position:0%
called alternative compliance payments
 
00:57:57.660 --> 00:57:59.390 align:start position:0%
called alternative compliance payments
acps

00:57:59.390 --> 00:57:59.400 align:start position:0%
acps
 
00:58:01.010 --> 00:58:01.020 align:start position:0%
many of the state's competitive
 
00:58:03.410 --> 00:58:03.420 align:start position:0%
suppliers of electricity have purchased
 
00:58:06.170 --> 00:58:06.180 align:start position:0%
acps instead of wrecks to avoid
 
00:58:08.329 --> 00:58:08.339 align:start position:0%
administrative expenses of purchase
 
00:58:10.069 --> 00:58:10.079 align:start position:0%
purchasing wrecks
 
00:58:12.349 --> 00:58:12.359 align:start position:0%
alternative compliance payments go into
 
00:58:15.829 --> 00:58:15.839 align:start position:0%
the renewable energy fund ref those
 
00:58:17.750 --> 00:58:17.760 align:start position:0%
payments go out as subsidies for energy
 
00:58:20.150 --> 00:58:20.160 align:start position:0%
projects like solar arrays
 
00:58:23.030 --> 00:58:23.040 align:start position:0%
once the one such project replaced two
 
00:58:25.250 --> 00:58:25.260 align:start position:0%
turbines and three valves boosting
 
00:58:28.430 --> 00:58:28.440 align:start position:0%
capacity by 0.44 megawatts at one
 
00:58:30.650 --> 00:58:30.660 align:start position:0%
hydroelectric facility
 
00:58:33.230 --> 00:58:33.240 align:start position:0%
this beat bill would rebate the ref
 
00:58:36.049 --> 00:58:36.059 align:start position:0%
dollars back to the rate payer employing
 
00:58:37.849 --> 00:58:37.859 align:start position:0%
the same mechanism that the Public
 
00:58:40.730 --> 00:58:40.740 align:start position:0%
Utilities Commission uses to rebate the
 
00:58:42.770 --> 00:58:42.780 align:start position:0%
Reggie or Regional greenhouse gas
 
00:58:45.230 --> 00:58:45.240 align:start position:0%
initiative auction credits back to rate
 
00:58:45.240 --> 00:58:46.309 align:start position:0%
initiative auction credits back to rate
payers

00:58:46.309 --> 00:58:46.319 align:start position:0%
payers
 
00:58:48.829 --> 00:58:48.839 align:start position:0%
it would be uniform across the board on
 
00:58:51.829 --> 00:58:51.839 align:start position:0%
a per kilowatt basis the these rebates
 
00:58:53.990 --> 00:58:54.000 align:start position:0%
would lower the cost of electricity for
 
00:58:55.849 --> 00:58:55.859 align:start position:0%
the state's rate payers
 
00:58:58.250 --> 00:58:58.260 align:start position:0%
as amended it makes the change temporary
 
00:59:01.130 --> 00:59:01.140 align:start position:0%
and restored language to ensure that the
 
00:59:03.170 --> 00:59:03.180 align:start position:0%
department of energy retained funds to
 
00:59:06.410 --> 00:59:06.420 align:start position:0%
administer the renewable energy fund
 
00:59:09.410 --> 00:59:09.420 align:start position:0%
ref collects seven to eight million
 
00:59:10.670 --> 00:59:10.680 align:start position:0%
dollars a year
 
00:59:12.530 --> 00:59:12.540 align:start position:0%
that is in addition to the over 4
 
00:59:14.270 --> 00:59:14.280 align:start position:0%
million a year that is rebated from
 
00:59:14.280 --> 00:59:15.349 align:start position:0%
million a year that is rebated from
Reggie

00:59:15.349 --> 00:59:15.359 align:start position:0%
Reggie
 
00:59:18.410 --> 00:59:18.420 align:start position:0%
it takes chipping away at this tax here
 
00:59:21.289 --> 00:59:21.299 align:start position:0%
and that fee there in order to make a
 
00:59:23.750 --> 00:59:23.760 align:start position:0%
difference in our ever shrinking wallets
 
00:59:25.910 --> 00:59:25.920 align:start position:0%
if you vote for this bill you will be
 
00:59:28.609 --> 00:59:28.619 align:start position:0%
voting to lower electricity costs
 
00:59:30.410 --> 00:59:30.420 align:start position:0%
so I ask you to please press the green
 
00:59:33.170 --> 00:59:33.180 align:start position:0%
button thank you Mr Speaker and I asked
 
00:59:36.289 --> 00:59:36.299 align:start position:0%

01:00:34.609 --> 01:00:34.619 align:start position:0%
the motion before us is ought to pass is
 
01:00:37.910 --> 01:00:37.920 align:start position:0%
amended on House Bill 246. this is a
 
01:00:39.950 --> 01:00:39.960 align:start position:0%
roll call vote care recognize the

speaker
 
01:00:49.730 --> 01:00:49.740 align:start position:0%
if I know that the renewable energy fund
 
01:00:52.390 --> 01:00:52.400 align:start position:0%
helps to diversify our energy sources
 
01:00:55.069 --> 01:00:55.079 align:start position:0%
protecting New Hampshire residents from
 
01:00:57.950 --> 01:00:57.960 align:start position:0%
Wild swings in energy costs
 
01:01:00.650 --> 01:01:00.660 align:start position:0%
and if I know that renewable energy
 
01:01:03.530 --> 01:01:03.540 align:start position:0%
reduces the amount of expensive natural
 
01:01:06.109 --> 01:01:06.119 align:start position:0%
gas used by New Hampshire utility
 
01:01:09.170 --> 01:01:09.180 align:start position:0%
customers thereby reducing the demand
 
01:01:11.470 --> 01:01:11.480 align:start position:0%
for natural gas and hence its price
 
01:01:15.650 --> 01:01:15.660 align:start position:0%
would I press the red button to vote no
 
01:01:17.630 --> 01:01:17.640 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker

Thomas for parliamentary inquiry
 
01:01:24.829 --> 01:01:24.839 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker if I
 
01:01:27.589 --> 01:01:27.599 align:start position:0%
know that this bill temporarily suspends
 
01:01:30.530 --> 01:01:30.540 align:start position:0%
the refs during this time of excessive
 
01:01:32.870 --> 01:01:32.880 align:start position:0%
electricity costs to our suffering rate
 
01:01:32.880 --> 01:01:34.370 align:start position:0%
electricity costs to our suffering rate
payers

01:01:34.370 --> 01:01:34.380 align:start position:0%
payers
 
01:01:37.849 --> 01:01:37.859 align:start position:0%
now not five years from now and if I
 
01:01:39.829 --> 01:01:39.839 align:start position:0%
also know that this amendment restores
 
01:01:42.289 --> 01:01:42.299 align:start position:0%
language to ensure that the department
 
01:01:44.930 --> 01:01:44.940 align:start position:0%
of energy retained funds to administer
 
01:01:47.630 --> 01:01:47.640 align:start position:0%
the ref later on
 
01:01:50.510 --> 01:01:50.520 align:start position:0%
but more importantly further on do if I
 
01:01:55.130 --> 01:01:55.140 align:start position:0%
know that these taxes all add up ever so
 
01:01:57.470 --> 01:01:57.480 align:start position:0%
small but they all add up and that this
 
01:02:00.530 --> 01:02:00.540 align:start position:0%
bill chips away at them bit by bit we
 
01:02:02.870 --> 01:02:02.880 align:start position:0%
need so that we show our rape here is we

thank you Mr Speaker
 
01:07:46.970 --> 01:07:46.980 align:start position:0%
I rise in opposition to house bill 418.
 
01:07:49.730 --> 01:07:49.740 align:start position:0%
this bill seeks to eliminate the auction
 
01:07:52.010 --> 01:07:52.020 align:start position:0%
proceeds rebate to rate payers from the
 
01:07:54.349 --> 01:07:54.359 align:start position:0%
regional greenhouse gas initiative
 
01:07:57.710 --> 01:07:57.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:00.349 --> 01:08:00.359 align:start position:0%
more commonly known as Reggie
 
01:08:03.049 --> 01:08:03.059 align:start position:0%
Reggie is a cap and trade scheme in
 
01:08:05.569 --> 01:08:05.579 align:start position:0%
order to emit carbon dioxide energy
 
01:08:07.430 --> 01:08:07.440 align:start position:0%
generators are companies that produce
 
01:08:09.529 --> 01:08:09.539 align:start position:0%
energy are forced to purchase Reggie
 
01:08:12.049 --> 01:08:12.059 align:start position:0%
credits the cost for this is then passed
 
01:08:15.170 --> 01:08:15.180 align:start position:0%
on to rate payers however the rebate of
 
01:08:16.970 --> 01:08:16.980 align:start position:0%
Reggie credits has been in place since
 
01:08:20.630 --> 01:08:20.640 align:start position:0%
2012 saving rate pairs 120 million to
 
01:08:23.990 --> 01:08:24.000 align:start position:0%
160 million dollars in the past 10 years
 
01:08:26.030 --> 01:08:26.040 align:start position:0%
during the hearing the sponsor of this
 
01:08:27.590 --> 01:08:27.600 align:start position:0%
Bill said that the money does not belong
 
01:08:29.570 --> 01:08:29.580 align:start position:0%
to the rate payer and that this bill is
 
01:08:31.309 --> 01:08:31.319 align:start position:0%
a correction
 
01:08:33.769 --> 01:08:33.779 align:start position:0%
we do not find a 40 million dollar tax
 
01:08:36.470 --> 01:08:36.480 align:start position:0%
hike to be a correction
 
01:08:38.870 --> 01:08:38.880 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire utilities have seen their
 
01:08:41.209 --> 01:08:41.219 align:start position:0%
costs for electricity nearly double due
 
01:08:43.130 --> 01:08:43.140 align:start position:0%
to Federal policies that inhibit the
 
01:08:44.990 --> 01:08:45.000 align:start position:0%
production and distribution of natural
 
01:08:47.450 --> 01:08:47.460 align:start position:0%
gas and oil which are reliable sources
 
01:08:48.709 --> 01:08:48.719 align:start position:0%
of energy
 
01:08:50.990 --> 01:08:51.000 align:start position:0%
the price of natural gas dictates the
 
01:08:53.030 --> 01:08:53.040 align:start position:0%
cost of electricity
 
01:08:55.309 --> 01:08:55.319 align:start position:0%
political pressures have compounded the
 
01:08:55.319 --> 01:08:56.390 align:start position:0%
political pressures have compounded the
problem

01:08:56.390 --> 01:08:56.400 align:start position:0%
problem
 
01:08:58.490 --> 01:08:58.500 align:start position:0%
adding costs to our state's already
 
01:09:00.950 --> 01:09:00.960 align:start position:0%
record high electricity bills hurts
 
01:09:03.169 --> 01:09:03.179 align:start position:0%
residents and businesses alike
 
01:09:05.630 --> 01:09:05.640 align:start position:0%
we cannot justify raising the average
 
01:09:07.849 --> 01:09:07.859 align:start position:0%
rate payers bill by twenty five dollars
 
01:09:09.829 --> 01:09:09.839 align:start position:0%
to forty five dollars a year
 
01:09:12.229 --> 01:09:12.239 align:start position:0%
if you vote for your bit this bill your
 
01:09:14.030 --> 01:09:14.040 align:start position:0%
constituents will know that you voted to
 
01:09:16.550 --> 01:09:16.560 align:start position:0%
raise their electric bill at a time when
 
01:09:18.590 --> 01:09:18.600 align:start position:0%
some may be spending 40 percent of their
 
01:09:20.570 --> 01:09:20.580 align:start position:0%
paychecks on electricity heat and gas
 
01:09:21.890 --> 01:09:21.900 align:start position:0%
for their car
 
01:09:24.110 --> 01:09:24.120 align:start position:0%
please press the red button so that a
 
01:09:26.450 --> 01:09:26.460 align:start position:0%
new motion can be made thank you Mr
 
01:09:26.460 --> 01:09:28.070 align:start position:0%
new motion can be made thank you Mr
Speaker

01:09:28.070 --> 01:09:28.080 align:start position:0%
Speaker
 
01:09:36.950 --> 01:09:36.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:38.749 --> 01:09:38.759 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker I rise in
 
01:09:40.610 --> 01:09:40.620 align:start position:0%
opposition to this bill
 
01:09:42.470 --> 01:09:42.480 align:start position:0%
I could bore everybody with a lot of
 
01:09:44.090 --> 01:09:44.100 align:start position:0%
facts about Reggie as I've been involved
 
01:09:46.010 --> 01:09:46.020 align:start position:0%
in Reggie longer than anybody in the
 
01:09:48.050 --> 01:09:48.060 align:start position:0%
state other than Bob Scott we were both
 
01:09:49.370 --> 01:09:49.380 align:start position:0%
appointed by the governor a long time
 
01:09:51.590 --> 01:09:51.600 align:start position:0%
ago on this but the fact remains is this
 
01:09:54.410 --> 01:09:54.420 align:start position:0%
is this is a raise your rates of
 
01:09:55.910 --> 01:09:55.920 align:start position:0%
electricity we've heard it over and over
 
01:09:57.590 --> 01:09:57.600 align:start position:0%
again well it's we can't control
 
01:09:59.510 --> 01:09:59.520 align:start position:0%
electric rates as a former puc
 
01:10:01.610 --> 01:10:01.620 align:start position:0%
commission there's not a lot we can do I
 
01:10:03.530 --> 01:10:03.540 align:start position:0%
realize that it's a regional market set
 
01:10:06.350 --> 01:10:06.360 align:start position:0%
in New England and National policies but
 
01:10:08.209 --> 01:10:08.219 align:start position:0%
we can prevent doing things like this
 
01:10:10.370 --> 01:10:10.380 align:start position:0%
will directly cause people's rates to go
 
01:10:10.380 --> 01:10:11.570 align:start position:0%
will directly cause people's rates to go
up

01:10:11.570 --> 01:10:11.580 align:start position:0%
up
 
01:10:14.270 --> 01:10:14.280 align:start position:0%
we spend 72 million dollars a year on
 
01:10:16.130 --> 01:10:16.140 align:start position:0%
Energy Efficiency projects that is all
 
01:10:17.510 --> 01:10:17.520 align:start position:0%
rate payer funded in New Hampshire
 
01:10:19.490 --> 01:10:19.500 align:start position:0%
that's more than doubled in the last few
 
01:10:19.500 --> 01:10:20.870 align:start position:0%
that's more than doubled in the last few
years

01:10:20.870 --> 01:10:20.880 align:start position:0%
years
 
01:10:22.729 --> 01:10:22.739 align:start position:0%
we have lots of money for that in fact
 
01:10:24.050 --> 01:10:24.060 align:start position:0%
sometimes they actually have trouble
 
01:10:25.669 --> 01:10:25.679 align:start position:0%
spending it all
 
01:10:28.130 --> 01:10:28.140 align:start position:0%
and everyone keeps telling us that this
 
01:10:30.229 --> 01:10:30.239 align:start position:0%
salvation is an Energy Efficiency all
 
01:10:31.570 --> 01:10:31.580 align:start position:0%
you have to do is look to the Future
 
01:10:34.490 --> 01:10:34.500 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts spends multiple times what
 
01:10:36.350 --> 01:10:36.360 align:start position:0%
we do on Energy Efficiency that they
 
01:10:38.149 --> 01:10:38.159 align:start position:0%
take from their rate payers yet their
 
01:10:39.950 --> 01:10:39.960 align:start position:0%
electric rates are virtually the same as
 
01:10:42.110 --> 01:10:42.120 align:start position:0%
we are depending on the date when the
 
01:10:43.850 --> 01:10:43.860 align:start position:0%
contracts assigned sometimes they're a
 
01:10:45.410 --> 01:10:45.420 align:start position:0%
little lower sometimes they're a little
 
01:10:47.450 --> 01:10:47.460 align:start position:0%
higher but they're virtually the same so
 
01:10:49.490 --> 01:10:49.500 align:start position:0%
if Energy Efficiency was this Panacea
 
01:10:51.590 --> 01:10:51.600 align:start position:0%
that would be in told it is then their
 
01:10:53.270 --> 01:10:53.280 align:start position:0%
rates should be substantially lower than
 
01:10:55.790 --> 01:10:55.800 align:start position:0%
ours but they're not remember this does
 
01:10:57.649 --> 01:10:57.659 align:start position:0%
not reduce any funding for Energy
 
01:11:00.169 --> 01:11:00.179 align:start position:0%
Efficiency you're still going to pay on
 
01:11:01.970 --> 01:11:01.980 align:start position:0%
the assistant benefits charge for every
 
01:11:04.370 --> 01:11:04.380 align:start position:0%
kilowatt hour that you buy you will pay
 
01:11:05.870 --> 01:11:05.880 align:start position:0%
a fee that goes towards Energy
 
01:11:08.450 --> 01:11:08.460 align:start position:0%
Efficiency projects so I urge you to
 
01:11:10.790 --> 01:11:10.800 align:start position:0%
please vote against this bill do not
 
01:11:12.950 --> 01:11:12.960 align:start position:0%
raise your electric rates on you on your
 
01:11:14.750 --> 01:11:14.760 align:start position:0%
rate payers
 
01:11:20.410 --> 01:11:20.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:22.790 --> 01:11:22.800 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
01:11:25.610 --> 01:11:25.620 align:start position:0%
I rise again this time to speak in favor
 
01:11:28.610 --> 01:11:28.620 align:start position:0%
of adopting HB 418
 
01:11:30.470 --> 01:11:30.480 align:start position:0%
the Energy Efficiency fund is a
 
01:11:33.770 --> 01:11:33.780 align:start position:0%
dedicated fund created in 2008 when New
 
01:11:35.689 --> 01:11:35.699 align:start position:0%
Hampshire joined the regional greenhouse

gas initiative otherwise known as Reggie
 
01:11:41.270 --> 01:11:41.280 align:start position:0%
Reggie is a regional market for emission
 
01:11:42.830 --> 01:11:42.840 align:start position:0%
allowances which are sold to electric
 
01:11:44.930 --> 01:11:44.940 align:start position:0%
power producers at quarterly auctions
 
01:11:47.149 --> 01:11:47.159 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's share of emission
 
01:11:49.250 --> 01:11:49.260 align:start position:0%
allowances is deposited in the Energy
 
01:11:51.169 --> 01:11:51.179 align:start position:0%
Efficiency fund
 
01:11:53.390 --> 01:11:53.400 align:start position:0%
one of the best and easiest ways to
 
01:11:56.390 --> 01:11:56.400 align:start position:0%
reduce our dependence on fossil fuel and
 
01:11:58.970 --> 01:11:58.980 align:start position:0%
the impact it has in our pocketbooks is
 
01:12:00.950 --> 01:12:00.960 align:start position:0%
to reduce our demand for electricity
 
01:12:03.890 --> 01:12:03.900 align:start position:0%
produced using those fuels
 
01:12:06.290 --> 01:12:06.300 align:start position:0%
if we can lower the demand then we all
 
01:12:08.330 --> 01:12:08.340 align:start position:0%
benefit with lower prices
 
01:12:10.669 --> 01:12:10.679 align:start position:0%
that is exactly what the original intent
 
01:12:13.729 --> 01:12:13.739 align:start position:0%
of the Energy Efficiency fund was
 
01:12:16.130 --> 01:12:16.140 align:start position:0%
the legislation originally intended that
 
01:12:18.530 --> 01:12:18.540 align:start position:0%
100 percent of New Hampshire's regi
 
01:12:20.450 --> 01:12:20.460 align:start position:0%
allowances would be used to support
 
01:12:23.390 --> 01:12:23.400 align:start position:0%
Energy Efficiency conservation and
 
01:12:25.729 --> 01:12:25.739 align:start position:0%
demand response programs
 
01:12:28.990 --> 01:12:29.000 align:start position:0%
however legislation passed in 2013
 
01:12:32.209 --> 01:12:32.219 align:start position:0%
dictated that only the first dollar per
 
01:12:34.910 --> 01:12:34.920 align:start position:0%
ton of each allowance sold could be used
 
01:12:37.669 --> 01:12:37.679 align:start position:0%
to fund the Energy Efficiency fund
 
01:12:40.370 --> 01:12:40.380 align:start position:0%
since 2013 the remaining proceeds are
 
01:12:42.590 --> 01:12:42.600 align:start position:0%
rebated to utility rate payers
 
01:12:44.570 --> 01:12:44.580 align:start position:0%
this bill would reverse that decision
 
01:12:47.510 --> 01:12:47.520 align:start position:0%
and ensure that all proceeds from the
 
01:12:49.910 --> 01:12:49.920 align:start position:0%
sale of emission allowances are used to
 
01:12:52.070 --> 01:12:52.080 align:start position:0%
reduce energy demand
 
01:12:54.350 --> 01:12:54.360 align:start position:0%
according to the investment of Reggie
 
01:12:58.010 --> 01:12:58.020 align:start position:0%
proceeds in 2020 report issued in May of
 
01:12:58.020 --> 01:12:59.450 align:start position:0%
proceeds in 2020 report issued in May of
2022

01:12:59.450 --> 01:12:59.460 align:start position:0%
2022
 
01:13:01.209 --> 01:13:01.219 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire received approximately
 
01:13:03.649 --> 01:13:03.659 align:start position:0%
18.8 million dollars in Reggie
 
01:13:07.250 --> 01:13:07.260 align:start position:0%
allowances proceeds during 2020.
 
01:13:09.890 --> 01:13:09.900 align:start position:0%
2.5 million of that
 
01:13:11.930 --> 01:13:11.940 align:start position:0%
total were allocated to the Energy
 
01:13:14.870 --> 01:13:14.880 align:start position:0%
Efficiency fund and invested to install
 
01:13:18.050 --> 01:13:18.060 align:start position:0%
Energy Efficiency measures in 163
 
01:13:20.709 --> 01:13:20.719 align:start position:0%
municipal buildings and to weatherize
 
01:13:22.970 --> 01:13:22.980 align:start position:0%
476 homes
 
01:13:26.090 --> 01:13:26.100 align:start position:0%
that small investment of 2.5 million
 
01:13:29.750 --> 01:13:29.760 align:start position:0%
dollars will save over 53
 
01:13:32.630 --> 01:13:32.640 align:start position:0%
000 megawatts of electricity and will
 
01:13:35.930 --> 01:13:35.940 align:start position:0%
lower electricity rates by 10.5 million
 
01:13:37.310 --> 01:13:37.320 align:start position:0%
dollars over the life of those
 
01:13:37.320 --> 01:13:38.570 align:start position:0%
dollars over the life of those
improvements

01:13:38.570 --> 01:13:38.580 align:start position:0%
improvements
 
01:13:40.669 --> 01:13:40.679 align:start position:0%
that is a return on investment of over
 
01:13:42.709 --> 01:13:42.719 align:start position:0%
400 percent
 
01:13:44.390 --> 01:13:44.400 align:start position:0%
the science technology and energy

committee received testimony from the
 
01:13:49.070 --> 01:13:49.080 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Department of energy that
 
01:13:50.870 --> 01:13:50.880 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's share of Reggie
 
01:13:55.310 --> 01:13:55.320 align:start position:0%
allowances sales in 2022 was 43 million
 
01:13:55.320 --> 01:13:56.570 align:start position:0%
allowances sales in 2022 was 43 million
dollars

01:13:56.570 --> 01:13:56.580 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
01:13:59.689 --> 01:13:59.699 align:start position:0%
40 million of 40 million was rebated in
 
01:14:02.990 --> 01:14:03.000 align:start position:0%
short-term savings to customers the
 
01:14:05.110 --> 01:14:05.120 align:start position:0%
equivalent of about
 
01:14:08.750 --> 01:14:08.760 align:start position:0%
1.77 per month for the typical
 
01:14:10.850 --> 01:14:10.860 align:start position:0%
residential customer
 
01:14:13.189 --> 01:14:13.199 align:start position:0%
none of that 40 million dollars was used
 
01:14:15.110 --> 01:14:15.120 align:start position:0%
to help reduce the overall demand for
 
01:14:16.850 --> 01:14:16.860 align:start position:0%
power in our state
 
01:14:19.610 --> 01:14:19.620 align:start position:0%
had it been invested in projects to
 
01:14:22.550 --> 01:14:22.560 align:start position:0%
reduce demand similar to those in 2020
 
01:14:24.770 --> 01:14:24.780 align:start position:0%
the long-term reduction in cust and
 
01:14:27.189 --> 01:14:27.199 align:start position:0%
consumer bills would be approximately
 
01:14:30.350 --> 01:14:30.360 align:start position:0%
160 million dollars
 
01:14:32.270 --> 01:14:32.280 align:start position:0%
and that would only be from one year's
 
01:14:34.370 --> 01:14:34.380 align:start position:0%
worth of Energy Efficiency fund
 
01:14:34.380 --> 01:14:35.510 align:start position:0%
worth of Energy Efficiency fund
Investments

01:14:35.510 --> 01:14:35.520 align:start position:0%
Investments
 
01:14:37.669 --> 01:14:37.679 align:start position:0%
had we not changed the rules in 2013
 
01:14:39.530 --> 01:14:39.540 align:start position:0%
under which Reggie allowances were
 
01:14:42.290 --> 01:14:42.300 align:start position:0%
utilized and had instead consistently
 
01:14:44.390 --> 01:14:44.400 align:start position:0%
invested those funds in projects to
 
01:14:46.910 --> 01:14:46.920 align:start position:0%
reduce demand there is every reason to
 
01:14:49.189 --> 01:14:49.199 align:start position:0%
believe that the impact customers are
 
01:14:51.410 --> 01:14:51.420 align:start position:0%
facing now because of our over-reliance
 
01:14:53.870 --> 01:14:53.880 align:start position:0%
on natural gas to generate electricity
 
01:14:55.430 --> 01:14:55.440 align:start position:0%
would be less
 
01:14:57.110 --> 01:14:57.120 align:start position:0%
all of us know that the cost of
 
01:14:59.450 --> 01:14:59.460 align:start position:0%
electricity in our state is too high
 
01:15:01.610 --> 01:15:01.620 align:start position:0%
the people of New Hampshire realize that
 
01:15:04.250 --> 01:15:04.260 align:start position:0%
when we rely almost exclusively on
 
01:15:06.110 --> 01:15:06.120 align:start position:0%
natural gas to produce our electricity
 
01:15:08.330 --> 01:15:08.340 align:start position:0%
we are going to have to pay the price
 
01:15:12.229 --> 01:15:12.239 align:start position:0%
when demand continues to outstrip supply
 
01:15:14.630 --> 01:15:14.640 align:start position:0%
they also know that when external events
 
01:15:17.330 --> 01:15:17.340 align:start position:0%
affect the supply of natural gas
 
01:15:19.669 --> 01:15:19.679 align:start position:0%
prices will continue to go up unless we
 
01:15:22.490 --> 01:15:22.500 align:start position:0%
do something to reduce demand
 
01:15:24.590 --> 01:15:24.600 align:start position:0%
it's time that we here in the people's
 
01:15:27.890 --> 01:15:27.900 align:start position:0%
house recognize that as well and once
 
01:15:30.709 --> 01:15:30.719 align:start position:0%
again ensure that 100 of the allowances
 
01:15:33.350 --> 01:15:33.360 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire receives from Reggie are
 
01:15:35.330 --> 01:15:35.340 align:start position:0%
used for the purpose they were intended
 
01:15:37.870 --> 01:15:37.880 align:start position:0%
to support Energy Efficiency
 
01:15:40.430 --> 01:15:40.440 align:start position:0%
conservation and demand response
 
01:15:43.550 --> 01:15:43.560 align:start position:0%
programs that will benefit all of us I
 
01:15:46.250 --> 01:15:46.260 align:start position:0%
urge you to join me in voting yes on the
 
01:15:48.890 --> 01:15:48.900 align:start position:0%
motion of ought to pass and Mr Speaker I
 
01:15:53.090 --> 01:15:53.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:55.189 --> 01:15:55.199 align:start position:0%
representative Vose has requested a roll
 
01:15:58.610 --> 01:15:58.620 align:start position:0%
call is that sufficiently seconded
 
01:16:00.770 --> 01:16:00.780 align:start position:0%
it is sufficiently seconded this will be
 
01:16:32.630 --> 01:16:32.640 align:start position:0%

01:17:00.470 --> 01:17:00.480 align:start position:0%
the motion before us is ought to pass on
 
01:17:04.189 --> 01:17:04.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:07.790 --> 01:17:07.800 align:start position:0%
this is a roll call vote
 
01:17:10.070 --> 01:17:10.080 align:start position:0%
care recognizes representative votes for
 
01:17:12.950 --> 01:17:12.960 align:start position:0%
a parliamentary inquiry
 
01:17:15.310 --> 01:17:15.320 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
01:17:18.410 --> 01:17:18.420 align:start position:0%
if I know this bill increases yearly
 
01:17:21.830 --> 01:17:21.840 align:start position:0%
electricity costs by 40 million dollars
 
01:17:24.590 --> 01:17:24.600 align:start position:0%
which will result in a 10-year cost of
 
01:17:28.189 --> 01:17:28.199 align:start position:0%
nearly a half a billion dollars
 
01:17:30.470 --> 01:17:30.480 align:start position:0%
and if I know we already spend 72
 
01:17:32.510 --> 01:17:32.520 align:start position:0%
million dollars on Energy Efficiency
 
01:17:32.520 --> 01:17:33.890 align:start position:0%
million dollars on Energy Efficiency
today

01:17:33.890 --> 01:17:33.900 align:start position:0%
today
 
01:17:36.590 --> 01:17:36.600 align:start position:0%
and that increasing that to 40 million
 
01:17:40.850 --> 01:17:40.860 align:start position:0%
dollars is an unnecessary expense
 
01:17:43.669 --> 01:17:43.679 align:start position:0%
what I now press the red motion button
 
01:17:45.830 --> 01:17:45.840 align:start position:0%

01:17:49.850 --> 01:17:49.860 align:start position:0%

if I know that Energy Efficiency reduces
 
01:18:55.729 --> 01:18:55.739 align:start position:0%
demand which lowers prices for everyone

hour is the one that we don't use
 
01:19:03.229 --> 01:19:03.239 align:start position:0%
and finally if I know that the role of
 
01:19:04.669 --> 01:19:04.679 align:start position:0%
the state government is to enact
 
01:19:07.010 --> 01:19:07.020 align:start position:0%

01:23:43.970 --> 01:23:43.980 align:start position:0%
give you to about 10 minutes of one
 
01:23:46.149 --> 01:23:46.159 align:start position:0%
so that we can get the senate in here
 
01:23:48.890 --> 01:23:48.900 align:start position:0%
and go into joint session right about
 
01:23:51.229 --> 01:23:51.239 align:start position:0%
one o'clock that's when the governor is

going to give his budget address

and then after the budget address which
 
01:23:57.890 --> 01:23:57.900 align:start position:0%
will probably take 45 minutes to an hour
 
01:24:01.070 --> 01:24:01.080 align:start position:0%
we will go back into session working on

01:26:06.470 --> 01:26:06.480 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
01:26:08.810 --> 01:26:08.820 align:start position:0%
um the amendment basically doesn't
 
01:26:11.090 --> 01:26:11.100 align:start position:0%
change the basic bill that much it's
 
01:26:14.209 --> 01:26:14.219 align:start position:0%
it's really too big and we're against
 
01:26:16.189 --> 01:26:16.199 align:start position:0%
the amendment as well we didn't hear it
 
01:26:18.470 --> 01:26:18.480 align:start position:0%
in public hearing as well
 
01:26:22.010 --> 01:26:22.020 align:start position:0%
so my speech I'm going to reserve my
 
01:26:24.649 --> 01:26:24.659 align:start position:0%
speech time for the actual bill itself
 
01:26:27.110 --> 01:26:27.120 align:start position:0%
but the amendment should not be passed
 
01:26:31.669 --> 01:26:31.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:33.290 --> 01:26:33.300 align:start position:0%

Williams

01:26:41.390 --> 01:26:41.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:43.310 --> 01:26:43.320 align:start position:0%
by the department of energy to clear up
 
01:26:45.530 --> 01:26:45.540 align:start position:0%
any concerns or questions about how
 
01:26:47.510 --> 01:26:47.520 align:start position:0%
funding would happen for administration
 
01:26:50.330 --> 01:26:50.340 align:start position:0%
of a fund the way this is set up is that
 
01:26:53.149 --> 01:26:53.159 align:start position:0%
there is a revolving energy fund and
 
01:26:54.649 --> 01:26:54.659 align:start position:0%
Department of energy may have
 
01:26:56.570 --> 01:26:56.580 align:start position:0%
administrative fees and costs including
 
01:26:58.010 --> 01:26:58.020 align:start position:0%
hiring new staff
 
01:27:00.110 --> 01:27:00.120 align:start position:0%
so the amendment is set up to make sure
 
01:27:02.390 --> 01:27:02.400 align:start position:0%
that if there are costs the federal
 
01:27:05.510 --> 01:27:05.520 align:start position:0%
funds that this bucket is created to
 
01:27:08.030 --> 01:27:08.040 align:start position:0%
receive could be used immediately for
 
01:27:09.649 --> 01:27:09.659 align:start position:0%
administrative costs for staff for
 
01:27:11.209 --> 01:27:11.219 align:start position:0%
Department of energy it was a
 
01:27:12.590 --> 01:27:12.600 align:start position:0%
clarification as part of what came out
 
01:27:14.209 --> 01:27:14.219 align:start position:0%
during the hearing on the underlying
 
01:27:15.410 --> 01:27:15.420 align:start position:0%
bill and I think that it's important
 
01:27:17.870 --> 01:27:17.880 align:start position:0%
that we do pay for administrative costs
 
01:27:20.450 --> 01:27:20.460 align:start position:0%
through federal funds because the
 
01:27:23.090 --> 01:27:23.100 align:start position:0%
overall Bill does not cost us anything
 
01:27:26.270 --> 01:27:26.280 align:start position:0%
as a state the intention of the green
 
01:27:29.810 --> 01:27:29.820 align:start position:0%
bank is to receive infrastructure
 
01:27:32.209 --> 01:27:32.219 align:start position:0%
reinvestment act funds for the State of
 
01:27:34.850 --> 01:27:34.860 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire this is already money that
 
01:27:36.649 --> 01:27:36.659 align:start position:0%
people from New Hampshire have paid in
 
01:27:39.229 --> 01:27:39.239 align:start position:0%
taxes to the federal government and they
 
01:27:41.629 --> 01:27:41.639 align:start position:0%
are coming back to our state
 
01:27:44.030 --> 01:27:44.040 align:start position:0%
and the intention of this bill is that
 
01:27:46.129 --> 01:27:46.139 align:start position:0%
department of energy could apply for and
 
01:27:49.189 --> 01:27:49.199 align:start position:0%
receive the funds in one big bucket and
 
01:27:51.250 --> 01:27:51.260 align:start position:0%
then direct how the funds will be used
 
01:27:54.530 --> 01:27:54.540 align:start position:0%
for infrastructure reinvestment here in
 
01:27:56.990 --> 01:27:57.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire you will hear that there
 
01:27:58.490 --> 01:27:58.500 align:start position:0%
is an opportunity for other
 
01:28:01.310 --> 01:28:01.320 align:start position:0%
organizations to apply for the funds but
 
01:28:03.410 --> 01:28:03.420 align:start position:0%
it would be piecemeal as opposed to the
 
01:28:06.050 --> 01:28:06.060 align:start position:0%
Department of energy and so therefore I
 
01:28:07.790 --> 01:28:07.800 align:start position:0%
ask that you vote Yes on this amendment
 
01:28:09.229 --> 01:28:09.239 align:start position:0%
to clarify that if there are
 
01:28:11.390 --> 01:28:11.400 align:start position:0%
administrative costs in receiving funds
 
01:28:13.610 --> 01:28:13.620 align:start position:0%
from the FED they are paid for through
 
01:28:15.890 --> 01:28:15.900 align:start position:0%
that bucket and not by us the state of
 
01:28:20.030 --> 01:28:20.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:22.370 --> 01:28:22.380 align:start position:0%
the question before us is floor
 
01:28:26.330 --> 01:28:26.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:26.340 --> 01:28:27.410 align:start position:0%
 
I

01:28:27.410 --> 01:28:27.420 align:start position:0%
I
 
01:28:29.990 --> 01:28:30.000 align:start position:0%

if I know that this underlying bill is
 
01:29:44.209 --> 01:29:44.219 align:start position:0%
really not necessary
 
01:29:46.910 --> 01:29:46.920 align:start position:0%
and if I also know that this amendment
 
01:29:49.850 --> 01:29:49.860 align:start position:0%
therefore is also unnecessary
 
01:29:51.950 --> 01:29:51.960 align:start position:0%

makes a good bill better and if I also

know that the department of energy
 
01:30:07.850 --> 01:30:07.860 align:start position:0%
specifically requested the amendment to
 
01:30:09.050 --> 01:30:09.060 align:start position:0%
this bill and it was done on their
 
01:30:11.209 --> 01:30:11.219 align:start position:0%
behalf following testimony to make sure
 
01:30:13.310 --> 01:30:13.320 align:start position:0%
that this would work if we have a bucket

to receive federal funds would I then
 
01:30:17.689 --> 01:30:17.699 align:start position:0%

01:31:34.490 --> 01:31:34.500 align:start position:0%
HB 630 as amended the motion is ought to
 
01:31:36.350 --> 01:31:36.360 align:start position:0%
pass as amended chair recognizes
 
01:31:41.330 --> 01:31:41.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:43.430 --> 01:31:43.440 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
01:31:45.830 --> 01:31:45.840 align:start position:0%
you know it gives me great pleasure to
 
01:31:47.750 --> 01:31:47.760 align:start position:0%
finally say that I don't have to say one
 
01:31:51.350 --> 01:31:51.360 align:start position:0%
word about kilowatt hours Rex Reggie RPS
 
01:31:54.470 --> 01:31:54.480 align:start position:0%
net metering because they just don't
 
01:31:56.030 --> 01:31:56.040 align:start position:0%
apply to this bill
 
01:31:58.970 --> 01:31:58.980 align:start position:0%
the fact is is that this bill is not
 
01:31:58.980 --> 01:32:00.410 align:start position:0%
the fact is is that this bill is not
needed

01:32:00.410 --> 01:32:00.420 align:start position:0%
needed
 
01:32:03.229 --> 01:32:03.239 align:start position:0%
we already have mechanisms in place that
 
01:32:06.490 --> 01:32:06.500 align:start position:0%
can handle this this particular program
 
01:32:09.050 --> 01:32:09.060 align:start position:0%
you've heard it's a revolving fund they
 
01:32:11.810 --> 01:32:11.820 align:start position:0%
call it a green Bank fund to receive
 
01:32:14.510 --> 01:32:14.520 align:start position:0%
federal dollars it comes from the
 
01:32:18.169 --> 01:32:18.179 align:start position:0%
greenhouse gas reduction fund which has
 
01:32:19.729 --> 01:32:19.739 align:start position:0%
not been given to us yet it's a
 
01:32:22.310 --> 01:32:22.320 align:start position:0%
competitive Grant we don't know how much
 
01:32:24.350 --> 01:32:24.360 align:start position:0%
money we might get we might get none of
 
01:32:26.629 --> 01:32:26.639 align:start position:0%
the 27 billion that is being offered out
 
01:32:26.639 --> 01:32:27.350 align:start position:0%
the 27 billion that is being offered out
there

01:32:27.350 --> 01:32:27.360 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:32:29.930 --> 01:32:29.940 align:start position:0%
uh but I'm sure we'll get some if we ask
 
01:32:32.830 --> 01:32:32.840 align:start position:0%
for it apply for it appropriately
 
01:32:35.629 --> 01:32:35.639 align:start position:0%
the department of energy would be the
 
01:32:38.330 --> 01:32:38.340 align:start position:0%
managing Agency for these funds if they
 
01:32:39.950 --> 01:32:39.960 align:start position:0%
came in here but from their own
 
01:32:39.960 --> 01:32:41.570 align:start position:0%
came in here but from their own
testimony

01:32:41.570 --> 01:32:41.580 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
01:32:44.149 --> 01:32:44.159 align:start position:0%
Doe's own testimony says that they have
 
01:32:46.790 --> 01:32:46.800 align:start position:0%
mechanisms mechanisms already in place
 
01:32:49.610 --> 01:32:49.620 align:start position:0%
to receive funds like this having a
 
01:32:52.729 --> 01:32:52.739 align:start position:0%
revolving Green Bank fund is not a
 
01:32:55.030 --> 01:32:55.040 align:start position:0%
condition to receive these Federal
 
01:32:57.950 --> 01:32:57.960 align:start position:0%
monies at all we we don't need it it's
 
01:33:00.110 --> 01:33:00.120 align:start position:0%
not a condition to get it
 
01:33:03.410 --> 01:33:03.420 align:start position:0%
so first of all one of the objections or
 
01:33:06.110 --> 01:33:06.120 align:start position:0%
one of the points a doe made was that
 
01:33:08.830 --> 01:33:08.840 align:start position:0%
it's uh was that it was not a condition
 
01:33:12.169 --> 01:33:12.179 align:start position:0%
and that and that they have they on
 
01:33:14.510 --> 01:33:14.520 align:start position:0%
revolving funds they have Outsourcing
 
01:33:17.209 --> 01:33:17.219 align:start position:0%
agencies that they go to to handle funds
 
01:33:19.310 --> 01:33:19.320 align:start position:0%
like this so they're already set up to
 
01:33:20.930 --> 01:33:20.940 align:start position:0%
do they just have to have the money and
 
01:33:23.149 --> 01:33:23.159 align:start position:0%
they choose which which one to you know
 
01:33:24.189 --> 01:33:24.199 align:start position:0%
send to
 
01:33:28.310 --> 01:33:28.320 align:start position:0%
uh the doe has experience and they're
 
01:33:30.950 --> 01:33:30.960 align:start position:0%
doing this in a in receiving grants like
 
01:33:35.090 --> 01:33:35.100 align:start position:0%
this and uh in terms of of uh this
 
01:33:36.830 --> 01:33:36.840 align:start position:0%
particular Bill we would be setting up
 
01:33:40.010 --> 01:33:40.020 align:start position:0%
just another revolving fund uh to handle
 
01:33:42.770 --> 01:33:42.780 align:start position:0%
monies that Doe can already dispense
 
01:33:44.990 --> 01:33:45.000 align:start position:0%
through through the mechanisms so
 
01:33:47.629 --> 01:33:47.639 align:start position:0%
finally uh the government has not
 
01:33:50.930 --> 01:33:50.940 align:start position:0%
released all of the details on this
 
01:33:53.330 --> 01:33:53.340 align:start position:0%
particular 27 billion dollars like what
 
01:33:55.370 --> 01:33:55.380 align:start position:0%
are the conditions where the what are
 
01:33:58.010 --> 01:33:58.020 align:start position:0%
the ramifications if we were to set up a
 
01:34:00.169 --> 01:34:00.179 align:start position:0%
revolving fund now specifically to
 
01:34:03.950 --> 01:34:03.960 align:start position:0%
receive these funds Doe's testimony said
 
01:34:06.770 --> 01:34:06.780 align:start position:0%
that we might be putting conditions or
 
01:34:10.129 --> 01:34:10.139 align:start position:0%
restrictions or guidelines in there that
 
01:34:12.590 --> 01:34:12.600 align:start position:0%
might eventually contradict what the
 
01:34:14.090 --> 01:34:14.100 align:start position:0%
federal government comes out with when
 
01:34:15.709 --> 01:34:15.719 align:start position:0%
they finally release those those
 
01:34:17.689 --> 01:34:17.699 align:start position:0%
guidelines those guidelines are not
 
01:34:20.510 --> 01:34:20.520 align:start position:0%
coming out at any time very soon even
 
01:34:22.189 --> 01:34:22.199 align:start position:0%
though this bill was passed some time
 
01:34:25.070 --> 01:34:25.080 align:start position:0%
ago previous examples of fundings that
 
01:34:27.290 --> 01:34:27.300 align:start position:0%
have been passed particularly say in
 
01:34:30.590 --> 01:34:30.600 align:start position:0%
2021 some of those guidelines still have
 
01:34:32.390 --> 01:34:32.400 align:start position:0%
not come out as to how we're going to
 
01:34:36.350 --> 01:34:36.360 align:start position:0%
handle or receive those so we're not in
 
01:34:39.410 --> 01:34:39.420 align:start position:0%
a rush and we if we establish something
 
01:34:41.330 --> 01:34:41.340 align:start position:0%
now we might be putting something into
 
01:34:43.010 --> 01:34:43.020 align:start position:0%
effect that may contradict the
 
01:34:44.689 --> 01:34:44.699 align:start position:0%
government later
 
01:34:47.030 --> 01:34:47.040 align:start position:0%
thank goodness I didn't have to use the
 
01:34:49.370 --> 01:34:49.380 align:start position:0%
word kilowatt hour on this one here it's
 
01:34:51.770 --> 01:34:51.780 align:start position:0%
just that we don't need this bill and so
 
01:34:54.410 --> 01:34:54.420 align:start position:0%
we suggest that we itl thank you Mr
 
01:34:54.420 --> 01:34:56.810 align:start position:0%
we suggest that we itl thank you Mr
Speaker

01:34:56.810 --> 01:34:56.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:58.250 --> 01:34:58.260 align:start position:0%
gee I recognize representative
 
01:34:58.260 --> 01:35:05.990 align:start position:0%
gee I recognize representative
McWilliams

01:35:05.990 --> 01:35:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:07.250 --> 01:35:07.260 align:start position:0%
May 14th
 
01:35:09.649 --> 01:35:09.659 align:start position:0%
we are just getting started here in the
 
01:35:12.050 --> 01:35:12.060 align:start position:0%
house and we're getting into our groove
 
01:35:14.990 --> 01:35:15.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:16.610 --> 01:35:16.620 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:35:19.010 --> 01:35:19.020 align:start position:0%
enables us to receive money from the
 
01:35:20.270 --> 01:35:20.280 align:start position:0%
federal government through the
 
01:35:21.350 --> 01:35:21.360 align:start position:0%
infrastructure reduction act
 
01:35:23.030 --> 01:35:23.040 align:start position:0%
reinvestment act
 
01:35:25.490 --> 01:35:25.500 align:start position:0%
we know that they've earmarked 27
 
01:35:28.129 --> 01:35:28.139 align:start position:0%
billion with a B dollars and some
 
01:35:30.110 --> 01:35:30.120 align:start position:0%
portion of that could come to New
 
01:35:32.330 --> 01:35:32.340 align:start position:0%
Hampshire if we apply for it
 
01:35:34.370 --> 01:35:34.380 align:start position:0%
this bill creates a bucket to receive
 
01:35:36.709 --> 01:35:36.719 align:start position:0%
the funds of the Department of energy
 
01:35:38.750 --> 01:35:38.760 align:start position:0%
the challenge here is that we the New
 
01:35:40.790 --> 01:35:40.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire legislature are only in
 
01:35:43.310 --> 01:35:43.320 align:start position:0%
sessions six months of the year but the
 
01:35:45.830 --> 01:35:45.840 align:start position:0%
federal government has these rolling
 
01:35:48.410 --> 01:35:48.420 align:start position:0%
funding opportunities that if you miss
 
01:35:50.570 --> 01:35:50.580 align:start position:0%
it if we're not in session if we're not
 
01:35:52.669 --> 01:35:52.679 align:start position:0%
voting if we're not able to do some kind
 
01:35:55.010 --> 01:35:55.020 align:start position:0%
of emergency legislation
 
01:35:56.750 --> 01:35:56.760 align:start position:0%
we miss out
 
01:35:58.729 --> 01:35:58.739 align:start position:0%
and so I would ask you to consider
 
01:36:00.890 --> 01:36:00.900 align:start position:0%
keeping this bill alive as long as we
 
01:36:02.570 --> 01:36:02.580 align:start position:0%
can while the FED gets their act
 
01:36:05.090 --> 01:36:05.100 align:start position:0%
together for the application so that we
 
01:36:06.530 --> 01:36:06.540 align:start position:0%
can meet in the middle and receive the
 
01:36:08.149 --> 01:36:08.159 align:start position:0%
funds through the department of energy
 
01:36:11.870 --> 01:36:11.880 align:start position:0%
through this new green bucket
 
01:36:14.209 --> 01:36:14.219 align:start position:0%
so that we can have the money when the
 
01:36:16.430 --> 01:36:16.440 align:start position:0%
application comes out even if we're not
 
01:36:19.010 --> 01:36:19.020 align:start position:0%
currently in session and so we do not
 
01:36:22.270 --> 01:36:22.280 align:start position:0%
miss out on that opportunity
 
01:36:24.410 --> 01:36:24.420 align:start position:0%
let me talk a little bit about a green
 
01:36:24.420 --> 01:36:25.910 align:start position:0%
let me talk a little bit about a green
Bank

01:36:25.910 --> 01:36:25.920 align:start position:0%
Bank
 
01:36:27.890 --> 01:36:27.900 align:start position:0%
what a green bank will not do is cost
 
01:36:29.149 --> 01:36:29.159 align:start position:0%
the state money
 
01:36:32.570 --> 01:36:32.580 align:start position:0%
a green Bank uses zero State funding
 
01:36:34.189 --> 01:36:34.199 align:start position:0%
and as amended even the administrative
 
01:36:35.870 --> 01:36:35.880 align:start position:0%
costs the department of energy will be
 
01:36:38.149 --> 01:36:38.159 align:start position:0%
covered by federal dollars
 
01:36:40.070 --> 01:36:40.080 align:start position:0%
this bill does Not Duplicate existing
 
01:36:42.530 --> 01:36:42.540 align:start position:0%
opportunities that already exist it
 
01:36:44.870 --> 01:36:44.880 align:start position:0%
expands the opportunities
 
01:36:46.490 --> 01:36:46.500 align:start position:0%
this bill Will Not Duplicate services
 
01:36:49.070 --> 01:36:49.080 align:start position:0%
offered by commercial banks in this
 
01:36:50.930 --> 01:36:50.940 align:start position:0%
instance the term Bank revolves to the
 
01:36:52.430 --> 01:36:52.440 align:start position:0%
revolving fund with the Department of
 
01:36:55.010 --> 01:36:55.020 align:start position:0%
energy and not a banking Institution
 
01:36:57.290 --> 01:36:57.300 align:start position:0%
would a green bank will do it will
 
01:36:58.550 --> 01:36:58.560 align:start position:0%
create a fund to help New Hampshire
 
01:37:00.590 --> 01:37:00.600 align:start position:0%
projects with challenges in the changing
 
01:37:02.149 --> 01:37:02.159 align:start position:0%
energy Market
 
01:37:04.189 --> 01:37:04.199 align:start position:0%
it will provide oversight through the
 
01:37:06.050 --> 01:37:06.060 align:start position:0%
department of energy to minimize risk
 
01:37:08.990 --> 01:37:09.000 align:start position:0%
choose priority projects and maximize
 
01:37:10.910 --> 01:37:10.920 align:start position:0%
these federal dollars for which New
 
01:37:13.610 --> 01:37:13.620 align:start position:0%
Hampshire will be eligible it will also
 
01:37:16.129 --> 01:37:16.139 align:start position:0%
attract private sector investment funds
 
01:37:18.410 --> 01:37:18.420 align:start position:0%
from the inflation reduction act can be
 
01:37:20.090 --> 01:37:20.100 align:start position:0%
leveraged with private funding to reduce
 
01:37:22.310 --> 01:37:22.320 align:start position:0%
Financial Risk and overcome Market
 
01:37:22.320 --> 01:37:23.510 align:start position:0%
Financial Risk and overcome Market
barriers

01:37:23.510 --> 01:37:23.520 align:start position:0%
barriers
 
01:37:25.430 --> 01:37:25.440 align:start position:0%
we cannot guarantee that New Hampshire
 
01:37:27.770 --> 01:37:27.780 align:start position:0%
will get a penny of the potential 27
 
01:37:29.990 --> 01:37:30.000 align:start position:0%
billion dollars that will become
 
01:37:31.850 --> 01:37:31.860 align:start position:0%
available for the states unless we have
 
01:37:34.550 --> 01:37:34.560 align:start position:0%
a mechanism for receiving the funds
 
01:37:37.129 --> 01:37:37.139 align:start position:0%
we do not know all the parameters now
 
01:37:39.229 --> 01:37:39.239 align:start position:0%
for administering the monies but let's
 
01:37:41.330 --> 01:37:41.340 align:start position:0%
be smart let's set it up and create a
 
01:37:44.149 --> 01:37:44.159 align:start position:0%
bucket to receive the funds and we know
 
01:37:45.770 --> 01:37:45.780 align:start position:0%
that our chances of maximizing those
 
01:37:48.350 --> 01:37:48.360 align:start position:0%
monies will be there when the time comes
 
01:37:50.930 --> 01:37:50.940 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:37:53.209 --> 01:37:53.219 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:37:56.330 --> 01:37:56.340 align:start position:0%
the motion before us is the ought to
 
01:37:58.490 --> 01:37:58.500 align:start position:0%
pass as amended motion on House Bill
 
01:37:58.500 --> 01:38:01.189 align:start position:0%
pass as amended motion on House Bill
630.

01:38:01.189 --> 01:38:01.199 align:start position:0%
630.
 
01:38:04.310 --> 01:38:04.320 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker if I
 
01:39:11.270 --> 01:39:11.280 align:start position:0%
know that the department of energy has
 
01:39:13.370 --> 01:39:13.380 align:start position:0%
many many buckets to receive federal
 
01:39:17.570 --> 01:39:17.580 align:start position:0%
dollars and does so all the time
 
01:39:20.450 --> 01:39:20.460 align:start position:0%
if I also know that the fiscal Committee
 
01:39:23.090 --> 01:39:23.100 align:start position:0%
of the general court meets year round
 
01:39:25.610 --> 01:39:25.620 align:start position:0%

or reject federal dollars
 
01:39:31.610 --> 01:39:31.620 align:start position:0%
and lastly if I know that the adopted
 
01:39:34.129 --> 01:39:34.139 align:start position:0%
Amendment describes such a complicated
 
01:39:37.189 --> 01:39:37.199 align:start position:0%
process to accept these federal dollars
 
01:39:39.649 --> 01:39:39.659 align:start position:0%
that it could prove to be more of a
 
01:39:42.050 --> 01:39:42.060 align:start position:0%
hindrance than a help
 
01:39:44.450 --> 01:39:44.460 align:start position:0%
what I now press the red button to avoid
 
01:39:46.550 --> 01:39:46.560 align:start position:0%
the rush to create something that we
 
01:39:48.169 --> 01:39:48.179 align:start position:0%
really don't need
 
01:39:50.510 --> 01:39:50.520 align:start position:0%

or streaming or TV I don't even know if
 
03:07:29.929 --> 03:07:29.939 align:start position:0%
it's on TV but uh it's a budget address
 
03:07:32.230 --> 03:07:32.240 align:start position:0%
so who isn't riveted to this right
 
03:07:35.510 --> 03:07:35.520 align:start position:0%
must-see TV so today I am here to

present uh the our my recommended budget
 
03:07:42.050 --> 03:07:42.060 align:start position:0%
for fiscal years 2024 and 2025 and it's
 
03:07:44.210 --> 03:07:44.220 align:start position:0%
an exciting opportunity to continue on
 
03:07:47.150 --> 03:07:47.160 align:start position:0%
our path of economic growth uh the
 
03:07:49.070 --> 03:07:49.080 align:start position:0%
ideals of personal Liberty that we've
 
03:07:51.650 --> 03:07:51.660 align:start position:0%
built over the past six years I can say
 
03:07:53.269 --> 03:07:53.279 align:start position:0%
without a doubt I'm traveling around the
 
03:07:55.190 --> 03:07:55.200 align:start position:0%
country a lot lately and without a doubt
 
03:07:56.929 --> 03:07:56.939 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire truly is the Envy of the
 
03:08:00.110 --> 03:08:00.120 align:start position:0%
nation and the free estate in the Union
 
03:08:02.809 --> 03:08:02.819 align:start position:0%
of other Governors and individuals will
 
03:08:04.490 --> 03:08:04.500 align:start position:0%
come up all the time they ask how has
 
03:08:06.170 --> 03:08:06.180 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire been so successful in
 
03:08:07.790 --> 03:08:07.800 align:start position:0%
keeping their economy strong even
 
03:08:10.010 --> 03:08:10.020 align:start position:0%
throughout covet and I explained to him
 
03:08:11.750 --> 03:08:11.760 align:start position:0%
it's because we don't overly burden our
 
03:08:13.969 --> 03:08:13.979 align:start position:0%
citizens with taxes and fees and we
 
03:08:15.710 --> 03:08:15.720 align:start position:0%
ensure businesses can be successful
 
03:08:18.170 --> 03:08:18.180 align:start position:0%
without unnecessary regulations and
 
03:08:20.929 --> 03:08:20.939 align:start position:0%
bureaucracy government is not here to
 
03:08:22.490 --> 03:08:22.500 align:start position:0%
guarantee a solution to your problems
 
03:08:25.910 --> 03:08:25.920 align:start position:0%
but it is here to pave a pathway of
 
03:08:28.010 --> 03:08:28.020 align:start position:0%
opportunity Pathways for economic growth
 
03:08:30.170 --> 03:08:30.180 align:start position:0%
Pathways for Educational Opportunity
 
03:08:32.870 --> 03:08:32.880 align:start position:0%
Pathways for lower taxes and Pathways
 
03:08:35.570 --> 03:08:35.580 align:start position:0%
for more personal freedoms
 
03:08:37.550 --> 03:08:37.560 align:start position:0%
over the last six years we've taken
 
03:08:39.710 --> 03:08:39.720 align:start position:0%
steps to chart a fiscally responsible
 
03:08:42.170 --> 03:08:42.180 align:start position:0%
and often a very Innovative course for
 
03:08:44.690 --> 03:08:44.700 align:start position:0%
our state those principles are all
 
03:08:46.370 --> 03:08:46.380 align:start position:0%
Guided by the budget
 
03:08:48.230 --> 03:08:48.240 align:start position:0%
it's a road map for the future and a
 
03:08:50.410 --> 03:08:50.420 align:start position:0%
blueprint for our continued success
 
03:08:52.790 --> 03:08:52.800 align:start position:0%
across this country states are facing
 
03:08:54.170 --> 03:08:54.180 align:start position:0%
budget shortfalls they're facing
 
03:08:56.389 --> 03:08:56.399 align:start position:0%
deficits when times were good these
 
03:08:58.490 --> 03:08:58.500 align:start position:0%
states increased taxes they built
 
03:09:00.170 --> 03:09:00.180 align:start position:0%
expensive new government programs
 
03:09:02.450 --> 03:09:02.460 align:start position:0%
without long-term strategies and frankly
 
03:09:04.730 --> 03:09:04.740 align:start position:0%
they spent like crazy but not here in
 
03:09:05.570 --> 03:09:05.580 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
03:09:07.969 --> 03:09:07.979 align:start position:0%
unlike Washington DC we balance our
 
03:09:10.670 --> 03:09:10.680 align:start position:0%
budgets in the 603 just like families do
 
03:09:13.130 --> 03:09:13.140 align:start position:0%
just like businesses have to unlike
 
03:09:14.809 --> 03:09:14.819 align:start position:0%
other states we don't raise taxes to
 
03:09:16.910 --> 03:09:16.920 align:start position:0%
meet our needs we shift resources to
 
03:09:19.010 --> 03:09:19.020 align:start position:0%
where they're needed the most and unlike
 
03:09:21.290 --> 03:09:21.300 align:start position:0%
the rest of the country we cut taxes we
 
03:09:22.790 --> 03:09:22.800 align:start position:0%
increase Investments we work together
 
03:09:25.429 --> 03:09:25.439 align:start position:0%
and we always find a way Republican and
 
03:09:27.830 --> 03:09:27.840 align:start position:0%
Democrat always find a way to get the
 
03:09:28.969 --> 03:09:28.979 align:start position:0%
job done
 
03:09:31.250 --> 03:09:31.260 align:start position:0%
we do it without a sales tax we do it
 
03:09:33.170 --> 03:09:33.180 align:start position:0%
without an income tax we do it without
 
03:09:36.170 --> 03:09:36.180 align:start position:0%
an estate tax we do it without this
 
03:09:38.750 --> 03:09:38.760 align:start position:0%
millionaires tax and good luck to
 
03:09:40.910 --> 03:09:40.920 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts on that one we'll see how
 
03:09:42.710 --> 03:09:42.720 align:start position:0%
that turns out and soon New Hampshire
 
03:09:44.750 --> 03:09:44.760 align:start position:0%
will completely do away with its
 
03:09:46.849 --> 03:09:46.859 align:start position:0%
interest and dividends tax as we fully
 
03:09:47.820 --> 03:09:47.830 align:start position:0%
phase that out
 
03:09:47.830 --> 03:09:53.990 align:start position:0%
phase that out
[Applause]

03:09:53.990 --> 03:09:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:56.450 --> 03:09:56.460 align:start position:0%
but wait there's more there's more in
 
03:09:58.250 --> 03:09:58.260 align:start position:0%
this budget I am recommending the
 
03:09:59.870 --> 03:09:59.880 align:start position:0%
complete elimination of the seven
 
03:10:01.969 --> 03:10:01.979 align:start position:0%
percent consumer communication Services
 
03:10:05.450 --> 03:10:05.460 align:start position:0%
tax it is outdated it is regressive and
 
03:10:07.670 --> 03:10:07.680 align:start position:0%
it is just High time we stopped taxing
 
03:10:11.030 --> 03:10:11.040 align:start position:0%
people on their phone calls
 
03:10:12.889 --> 03:10:12.899 align:start position:0%
it actually took me a while to realize
 
03:10:14.570 --> 03:10:14.580 align:start position:0%
that that's what we were doing we tax
 
03:10:16.610 --> 03:10:16.620 align:start position:0%
people for making a phone call it's just
 
03:10:18.050 --> 03:10:18.060 align:start position:0%
it's so regressive
 
03:10:19.910 --> 03:10:19.920 align:start position:0%
so unlike the fiscal confusion in
 
03:10:21.830 --> 03:10:21.840 align:start position:0%
Washington this budget is fiscal
 
03:10:24.290 --> 03:10:24.300 align:start position:0%
fiscally responsible and it's balanced
 
03:10:26.929 --> 03:10:26.939 align:start position:0%
it ensures a surplus with additional
 
03:10:30.050 --> 03:10:30.060 align:start position:0%
savings for our rainy day fund it has no
 
03:10:32.750 --> 03:10:32.760 align:start position:0%
new taxes or fees of any kind it
 
03:10:35.389 --> 03:10:35.399 align:start position:0%
provides relief to property taxpayers it
 
03:10:37.550 --> 03:10:37.560 align:start position:0%
sends more cash to schools and cities
 
03:10:40.550 --> 03:10:40.560 align:start position:0%
and towns it invests in our workers and
 
03:10:42.110 --> 03:10:42.120 align:start position:0%
for the first time ever we're
 
03:10:44.150 --> 03:10:44.160 align:start position:0%
recommending a significant adjustment to
 
03:10:46.490 --> 03:10:46.500 align:start position:0%
the education funding formula to ensure
 
03:10:48.650 --> 03:10:48.660 align:start position:0%
that we reduce the property tax burden
 
03:10:50.809 --> 03:10:50.819 align:start position:0%
to our citizens and give kids the
 
03:10:53.450 --> 03:10:53.460 align:start position:0%
adequacy that they deserve you've heard
 
03:10:55.190 --> 03:10:55.200 align:start position:0%
me say it before and you'll hear me say
 
03:10:56.870 --> 03:10:56.880 align:start position:0%
it many times again when it comes to
 
03:10:58.550 --> 03:10:58.560 align:start position:0%
government there is no greater
 
03:11:01.070 --> 03:11:01.080 align:start position:0%
responsibility than managing other
 
03:11:03.830 --> 03:11:03.840 align:start position:0%
people's money it is not our money it's
 
03:11:03.840 --> 03:11:05.030 align:start position:0%
people's money it is not our money it's
theirs

03:11:05.030 --> 03:11:05.040 align:start position:0%
theirs
 
03:11:07.309 --> 03:11:07.319 align:start position:0%
families across the state they're the
 
03:11:09.290 --> 03:11:09.300 align:start position:0%
ones that spend time away from their
 
03:11:11.630 --> 03:11:11.640 align:start position:0%
loved ones they're the ones that sweat
 
03:11:12.950 --> 03:11:12.960 align:start position:0%
out their paychecks and they work hard
 
03:11:15.530 --> 03:11:15.540 align:start position:0%
to earn a living and it's our job
 
03:11:17.269 --> 03:11:17.279 align:start position:0%
to let them keep as much of their money
 
03:11:18.769 --> 03:11:18.779 align:start position:0%
as possible and make sure we're being
 
03:11:20.929 --> 03:11:20.939 align:start position:0%
efficient with that trust
 
03:11:22.670 --> 03:11:22.680 align:start position:0%
when it comes to our state's finances
 
03:11:24.830 --> 03:11:24.840 align:start position:0%
times are good we have managed smartly
 
03:11:26.990 --> 03:11:27.000 align:start position:0%
we've maintained our economic advantages
 
03:11:29.510 --> 03:11:29.520 align:start position:0%
and we have worked hard to live within
 
03:11:31.910 --> 03:11:31.920 align:start position:0%
our means as a result we're proposing a
 
03:11:33.889 --> 03:11:33.899 align:start position:0%
smart and targeted budget that sets us
 
03:11:36.230 --> 03:11:36.240 align:start position:0%
all up for an even brighter future by
 
03:11:42.469 --> 03:11:42.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:44.929 --> 03:11:44.939 align:start position:0%
one of the big issues
 
03:11:47.330 --> 03:11:47.340 align:start position:0%
endemic people grew Restless they
 
03:11:49.130 --> 03:11:49.140 align:start position:0%
started exploring New Opportunities some
 
03:11:50.570 --> 03:11:50.580 align:start position:0%
many of them quit their jobs they look
 
03:11:52.070 --> 03:11:52.080 align:start position:0%
for new adventures they tried something
 
03:11:53.630 --> 03:11:53.640 align:start position:0%
different we saw it all over the country
 
03:11:55.610 --> 03:11:55.620 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire state government was not
 
03:11:57.290 --> 03:11:57.300 align:start position:0%
immune from these challenges like many
 
03:12:00.170 --> 03:12:00.180 align:start position:0%
Industries we continue to face a
 
03:12:01.969 --> 03:12:01.979 align:start position:0%
significant Workforce shortage right now
 
03:12:04.610 --> 03:12:04.620 align:start position:0%
our State Workforce vacancy hovers
 
03:12:06.650 --> 03:12:06.660 align:start position:0%
around 20 percent
 
03:12:08.990 --> 03:12:09.000 align:start position:0%
this budget will change that today I'm
 
03:12:10.610 --> 03:12:10.620 align:start position:0%
announcing that this budget includes an
 
03:12:12.290 --> 03:12:12.300 align:start position:0%
agreement between the state and union
 
03:12:14.450 --> 03:12:14.460 align:start position:0%
representatives for an across the board
 
03:12:17.389 --> 03:12:17.399 align:start position:0%
10 percent pay increase to our State
 
03:12:20.269 --> 03:12:20.279 align:start position:0%
Workforce the single largest increase in
 
03:12:22.670 --> 03:12:22.680 align:start position:0%
state worker salaries in nearly 50 years
 
03:12:24.710 --> 03:12:24.720 align:start position:0%
followed by another two percent raise
 
03:12:28.510 --> 03:12:28.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:28.520 --> 03:12:33.590 align:start position:0%
 
[Applause]

03:12:33.590 --> 03:12:33.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:35.750 --> 03:12:35.760 align:start position:0%
it's not because of its politicians and
 
03:12:37.670 --> 03:12:37.680 align:start position:0%
Concord it's because of the commitment
 
03:12:39.650 --> 03:12:39.660 align:start position:0%
to customer service from our employees
 
03:12:41.510 --> 03:12:41.520 align:start position:0%
that allows New Hampshire to be
 
03:12:43.610 --> 03:12:43.620 align:start position:0%
recognized as having America's best
 
03:12:46.190 --> 03:12:46.200 align:start position:0%
return on taxpayer investment and the
 
03:12:47.990 --> 03:12:48.000 align:start position:0%
most efficient government in the nation
 
03:12:49.849 --> 03:12:49.859 align:start position:0%
and to all of our ten thousand state
 
03:12:52.370 --> 03:12:52.380 align:start position:0%
employees we do say thank you
 
03:12:55.010 --> 03:12:55.020 align:start position:0%
another area that this budget focuses on
 
03:12:56.870 --> 03:12:56.880 align:start position:0%
is investments in our long-term future
 
03:13:00.050 --> 03:13:00.060 align:start position:0%
of course number one our kids you always
 
03:13:01.309 --> 03:13:01.319 align:start position:0%
got to be sure we're putting the kids
 
03:13:03.530 --> 03:13:03.540 align:start position:0%
first the foundation of any successful
 
03:13:05.630 --> 03:13:05.640 align:start position:0%
Community starts with education and
 
03:13:07.010 --> 03:13:07.020 align:start position:0%
today in New Hampshire a child's zip
 
03:13:08.929 --> 03:13:08.939 align:start position:0%
code does not define their chance at
 
03:13:11.929 --> 03:13:11.939 align:start position:0%
success in just the last six years we
 
03:13:13.490 --> 03:13:13.500 align:start position:0%
made record investments into early
 
03:13:16.969 --> 03:13:16.979 align:start position:0%
childhood education we signed a full day
 
03:13:19.550 --> 03:13:19.560 align:start position:0%
kindergarten into law we created career
 
03:13:20.990 --> 03:13:21.000 align:start position:0%
academies giving high school students
 
03:13:24.050 --> 03:13:24.060 align:start position:0%
access to an associate's degree at no
 
03:13:26.090 --> 03:13:26.100 align:start position:0%
cost we created the very successful
 
03:13:27.769 --> 03:13:27.779 align:start position:0%
education Freedom accounts for
 
03:13:30.590 --> 03:13:30.600 align:start position:0%
low-income families this budget Builds
 
03:13:32.570 --> 03:13:32.580 align:start position:0%
on those successes by taking the
 
03:13:34.910 --> 03:13:34.920 align:start position:0%
opportunity to rebuild the education
 
03:13:37.070 --> 03:13:37.080 align:start position:0%
funding formula allowing us to both
 
03:13:39.469 --> 03:13:39.479 align:start position:0%
reduce the property tax burden for towns
 
03:13:41.929 --> 03:13:41.939 align:start position:0%
across the state and increase base Aid
 
03:13:43.790 --> 03:13:43.800 align:start position:0%
inadequacy for the first time in history
 
03:13:47.030 --> 03:13:47.040 align:start position:0%
so how can we possibly spend more money
 
03:13:49.250 --> 03:13:49.260 align:start position:0%
on public education than ever before yet
 
03:13:51.170 --> 03:13:51.180 align:start position:0%
still cut taxes and reduce the
 
03:13:53.630 --> 03:13:53.640 align:start position:0%
obligation from local communities
 
03:13:56.929 --> 03:13:56.939 align:start position:0%
as we like to say we're Wicked smart
 
03:13:59.090 --> 03:13:59.100 align:start position:0%
right now the education funding formula
 
03:14:00.950 --> 03:14:00.960 align:start position:0%
for many of those in this room who have
 
03:14:03.230 --> 03:14:03.240 align:start position:0%
explored into it I think we can all
 
03:14:05.330 --> 03:14:05.340 align:start position:0%
agree it is overly complicated it is
 
03:14:07.250 --> 03:14:07.260 align:start position:0%
fundamentally in balance and it could
 
03:14:09.830 --> 03:14:09.840 align:start position:0%
and it creates an unspent Surplus every
 
03:14:11.090 --> 03:14:11.100 align:start position:0%
single year
 
03:14:12.830 --> 03:14:12.840 align:start position:0%
this proposal first and foremost
 
03:14:15.830 --> 03:14:15.840 align:start position:0%
simplifies things we start by increasing
 
03:14:18.650 --> 03:14:18.660 align:start position:0%
both base Aid and the free and reduced
 
03:14:21.410 --> 03:14:21.420 align:start position:0%
lunch by approximately 25 and 30 percent
 
03:14:24.469 --> 03:14:24.479 align:start position:0%
respectively just over this biennium
 
03:14:26.150 --> 03:14:26.160 align:start position:0%
overall New Hampshire schools will see
 
03:14:29.330 --> 03:14:29.340 align:start position:0%
an additional 200 million dollars over
 
03:14:31.670 --> 03:14:31.680 align:start position:0%
the next two years and an additional 1
 
03:14:33.769 --> 03:14:33.779 align:start position:0%
billion over the next 10 years all with
 
03:14:36.170 --> 03:14:36.180 align:start position:0%
a priority towards school districts that
 
03:14:38.389 --> 03:14:38.399 align:start position:0%
need Aid the most these Investments
 
03:14:40.309 --> 03:14:40.319 align:start position:0%
which which flow directly to Local
 
03:14:42.469 --> 03:14:42.479 align:start position:0%
Schools will help cities and towns
 
03:14:44.990 --> 03:14:45.000 align:start position:0%
offset their property taxes
 
03:14:47.150 --> 03:14:47.160 align:start position:0%
the changes proposed will also have the
 
03:14:48.950 --> 03:14:48.960 align:start position:0%
effect of increasing funding to Charter
 
03:14:51.530 --> 03:14:51.540 align:start position:0%
Schools and doubling the opportunity to
 
03:14:53.450 --> 03:14:53.460 align:start position:0%
our very successful education Freedom
 
03:14:53.460 --> 03:14:55.250 align:start position:0%
our very successful education Freedom
accounts

03:14:55.250 --> 03:14:55.260 align:start position:0%
accounts
 
03:14:58.190 --> 03:14:58.200 align:start position:0%
obligation and an opportunity
 
03:15:00.290 --> 03:15:00.300 align:start position:0%
to give families the ability and the
 
03:15:02.150 --> 03:15:02.160 align:start position:0%
freedom to chart their own path forward
 
03:15:04.309 --> 03:15:04.319 align:start position:0%
and let's never forget
 
03:15:05.990 --> 03:15:06.000 align:start position:0%
that it's not easy
 
03:15:07.849 --> 03:15:07.859 align:start position:0%
and we have to have the courage to set
 
03:15:10.429 --> 03:15:10.439 align:start position:0%
education funding on the right path once
 
03:15:12.650 --> 03:15:12.660 align:start position:0%
and for all critics say that many of our
 
03:15:14.450 --> 03:15:14.460 align:start position:0%
programs have grown too large to them I
 
03:15:16.429 --> 03:15:16.439 align:start position:0%
say this when a new door of opportunity
 
03:15:18.950 --> 03:15:18.960 align:start position:0%
is opened and our citizens are racing
 
03:15:20.809 --> 03:15:20.819 align:start position:0%
through in record numbers that's not an
 
03:15:22.550 --> 03:15:22.560 align:start position:0%
out of control system it's the
 
03:15:24.769 --> 03:15:24.779 align:start position:0%
government finally working that's a
 
03:15:26.150 --> 03:15:26.160 align:start position:0%
government finally ensuring that the
 
03:15:28.550 --> 03:15:28.560 align:start position:0%
system works for families and the system
 
03:15:30.590 --> 03:15:30.600 align:start position:0%
meets the needs of the child not the
 
03:15:31.730 --> 03:15:31.740 align:start position:0%
other way around
 
03:15:33.530 --> 03:15:33.540 align:start position:0%
and that's something that we should
 
03:15:35.269 --> 03:15:35.279 align:start position:0%
always be fighting for
 
03:15:37.670 --> 03:15:37.680 align:start position:0%
now believe it or not even after some of
 
03:15:39.530 --> 03:15:39.540 align:start position:0%
these changes are made we still have the
 
03:15:41.269 --> 03:15:41.279 align:start position:0%
opportunity to invest in significant
 
03:15:44.269 --> 03:15:44.279 align:start position:0%
School building Aid I'm proposing a 75
 
03:15:46.610 --> 03:15:46.620 align:start position:0%
million dollar investment taken directly
 
03:15:49.370 --> 03:15:49.380 align:start position:0%
from the education trust fund Surplus to
 
03:15:50.809 --> 03:15:50.819 align:start position:0%
get assistance to ensure that our
 
03:15:53.630 --> 03:15:53.640 align:start position:0%
buildings are as strong and as reliable
 
03:15:56.630 --> 03:15:56.640 align:start position:0%
as the kids that count on them
 
03:15:58.429 --> 03:15:58.439 align:start position:0%
so we're also we talk about we're
 
03:16:00.170 --> 03:16:00.180 align:start position:0%
funding kids at unprecedented levels
 
03:16:01.969 --> 03:16:01.979 align:start position:0%
huge opportunity there we're building
 
03:16:05.510 --> 03:16:05.520 align:start position:0%
new classrooms long uh in waiting to get
 
03:16:07.670 --> 03:16:07.680 align:start position:0%
school building Aid going again in a
 
03:16:09.590 --> 03:16:09.600 align:start position:0%
significant amount and we also have a
 
03:16:11.150 --> 03:16:11.160 align:start position:0%
chance to introduce new opportunities
 
03:16:13.670 --> 03:16:13.680 align:start position:0%
into our curriculum to ensure that our
 
03:16:15.530 --> 03:16:15.540 align:start position:0%
students have the next generation of
 
03:16:19.429 --> 03:16:19.439 align:start position:0%
Workforce skills namely computer science
 
03:16:21.290 --> 03:16:21.300 align:start position:0%
there's absolutely no job of the future
 
03:16:23.690 --> 03:16:23.700 align:start position:0%
not a single job of the future that will
 
03:16:26.030 --> 03:16:26.040 align:start position:0%
not rely on computers or computer
 
03:16:28.610 --> 03:16:28.620 align:start position:0%
science in some form the workforce
 
03:16:31.130 --> 03:16:31.140 align:start position:0%
demands today already outpace the
 
03:16:33.349 --> 03:16:33.359 align:start position:0%
available skills and these aren't just
 
03:16:35.389 --> 03:16:35.399 align:start position:0%
any jobs they are high paying careers
 
03:16:37.610 --> 03:16:37.620 align:start position:0%
and we can ensure that every one of our
 
03:16:39.830 --> 03:16:39.840 align:start position:0%
children has the opportunity to capture
 
03:16:42.349 --> 03:16:42.359 align:start position:0%
those openings I believe that computer
 
03:16:45.230 --> 03:16:45.240 align:start position:0%
science virtually guarantees that anyone
 
03:16:47.090 --> 03:16:47.100 align:start position:0%
with those skills will not end up in
 
03:16:49.490 --> 03:16:49.500 align:start position:0%
poverty and who better to learn language
 
03:16:52.190 --> 03:16:52.200 align:start position:0%
skills than children it's so much easier
 
03:16:54.230 --> 03:16:54.240 align:start position:0%
for kids to learn computers and computer
 
03:16:56.450 --> 03:16:56.460 align:start position:0%
coding than adults so let's be sure
 
03:16:58.429 --> 03:16:58.439 align:start position:0%
we're giving it to them
 
03:16:59.929 --> 03:16:59.939 align:start position:0%
I'm proposing New Hampshire's greatest
 
03:17:01.490 --> 03:17:01.500 align:start position:0%
computer science opportunity in history
 
03:17:03.950 --> 03:17:03.960 align:start position:0%
five million dollars towards a computer
 
03:17:06.170 --> 03:17:06.180 align:start position:0%
science initiative that creates a
 
03:17:08.750 --> 03:17:08.760 align:start position:0%
Statewide credentialing system pays

cost
 
03:17:17.809 --> 03:17:17.819 align:start position:0%
this budget also doubles down on real
 
03:17:19.670 --> 03:17:19.680 align:start position:0%
world applications by being the first
 
03:17:21.290 --> 03:17:21.300 align:start position:0%
state in America to bring it New
 
03:17:23.450 --> 03:17:23.460 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's first robotics to every
 
03:17:25.370 --> 03:17:25.380 align:start position:0%
middle and high school classroom in the
 
03:17:27.230 --> 03:17:27.240 align:start position:0%
state with their new experimental
 
03:17:29.630 --> 03:17:29.640 align:start position:0%
robotics program it's an exciting new
 
03:17:31.250 --> 03:17:31.260 align:start position:0%
program that allows students to grow
 
03:17:33.650 --> 03:17:33.660 align:start position:0%
their skills and prepare their pathway
 
03:17:35.389 --> 03:17:35.399 align:start position:0%
into the workforce
 
03:17:37.070 --> 03:17:37.080 align:start position:0%
now I also believe that understanding
 
03:17:40.250 --> 03:17:40.260 align:start position:0%
our system encourages participation in
 
03:17:42.410 --> 03:17:42.420 align:start position:0%
our system that's very much the New
 
03:17:43.790 --> 03:17:43.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire way it's very much part of our
 
03:17:45.950 --> 03:17:45.960 align:start position:0%
live for your die spirit
 
03:17:47.990 --> 03:17:48.000 align:start position:0%
we need to maintain our example for
 
03:17:49.910 --> 03:17:49.920 align:start position:0%
America with our community-based
 
03:17:52.010 --> 03:17:52.020 align:start position:0%
approach to government and community
 
03:17:54.050 --> 03:17:54.060 align:start position:0%
I'm proposing over two million dollars
 
03:17:56.090 --> 03:17:56.100 align:start position:0%
to develop and update a new
 
03:17:58.610 --> 03:17:58.620 align:start position:0%
hampshire-based Civics curriculum for
 
03:17:59.750 --> 03:17:59.760 align:start position:0%
our kids
 
03:18:01.610 --> 03:18:01.620 align:start position:0%
and finally I think we have an exciting
 
03:18:03.469 --> 03:18:03.479 align:start position:0%
opportunity to ensure that we're
 
03:18:05.870 --> 03:18:05.880 align:start position:0%
motivating our kids to be engaged and
 
03:18:08.510 --> 03:18:08.520 align:start position:0%
reach for the stars not all heroes wear
 
03:18:11.450 --> 03:18:11.460 align:start position:0%
capes but some wore spacesuits
 
03:18:13.490 --> 03:18:13.500 align:start position:0%
this week I'm establishing a commission
 
03:18:15.710 --> 03:18:15.720 align:start position:0%
and this budget will allocate funding
 
03:18:18.050 --> 03:18:18.060 align:start position:0%
for the design and construction of a
 
03:18:19.910 --> 03:18:19.920 align:start position:0%
statue of one of New Hampshire's most
 
03:18:22.490 --> 03:18:22.500 align:start position:0%
revered teachers Krista McAuliffe to be
 
03:18:24.469 --> 03:18:24.479 align:start position:0%
placed right here on State House grounds
 
03:18:26.510 --> 03:18:26.520 align:start position:0%
to commemorate her selfless contribution
 
03:18:28.429 --> 03:18:28.439 align:start position:0%
to the state of New Hampshire and the
 
03:18:30.889 --> 03:18:30.899 align:start position:0%
world it is long overdue and then
 
03:18:32.809 --> 03:18:32.819 align:start position:0%
undoubtedly will inspire the Next
 
03:18:32.819 --> 03:18:35.540 align:start position:0%
undoubtedly will inspire the Next
Generation

03:18:35.540 --> 03:18:35.550 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:35.550 --> 03:18:39.530 align:start position:0%
 
[Applause]

03:18:39.530 --> 03:18:39.540 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:41.630 --> 03:18:41.640 align:start position:0%
now beyond the classroom there continues
 
03:18:43.969 --> 03:18:43.979 align:start position:0%
to be a lot of opportunity to address
 
03:18:46.130 --> 03:18:46.140 align:start position:0%
our pressing needs the demand for mental
 
03:18:47.690 --> 03:18:47.700 align:start position:0%
health services for adults and children
 
03:18:49.910 --> 03:18:49.920 align:start position:0%
remains incredibly High not only in New
 
03:18:51.710 --> 03:18:51.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but Across the Nation
 
03:18:53.389 --> 03:18:53.399 align:start position:0%
that's why this past year the state made
 
03:18:55.490 --> 03:18:55.500 align:start position:0%
a landmark investment in the Children's
 
03:18:57.410 --> 03:18:57.420 align:start position:0%
Mental Health Services by purchasing
 
03:18:59.809 --> 03:18:59.819 align:start position:0%
Hampstead Hospital this budget continues
 
03:19:01.610 --> 03:19:01.620 align:start position:0%
to support that investment by providing
 
03:19:03.950 --> 03:19:03.960 align:start position:0%
much needed Financial Resources for its
 
03:19:05.870 --> 03:19:05.880 align:start position:0%
operation and long-term sustainability
 
03:19:08.450 --> 03:19:08.460 align:start position:0%
we're investing in juvenile peer-to-peer
 
03:19:10.849 --> 03:19:10.859 align:start position:0%
grief support services to help students
 
03:19:12.590 --> 03:19:12.600 align:start position:0%
cope with the loss of loved ones we're
 
03:19:14.210 --> 03:19:14.220 align:start position:0%
investing two million dollars into
 
03:19:16.370 --> 03:19:16.380 align:start position:0%
Family Resource Centers to help families
 
03:19:18.590 --> 03:19:18.600 align:start position:0%
in crisis get the supports that they
 
03:19:18.600 --> 03:19:19.429 align:start position:0%
in crisis get the supports that they
need

03:19:19.429 --> 03:19:19.439 align:start position:0%
need
 
03:19:21.469 --> 03:19:21.479 align:start position:0%
now not so unsurprisingly the lack of
 
03:19:23.389 --> 03:19:23.399 align:start position:0%
mental health Workforce continues to be
 
03:19:25.490 --> 03:19:25.500 align:start position:0%
something that holds us back that's why
 
03:19:28.070 --> 03:19:28.080 align:start position:0%
this budget provides student debt relief
 
03:19:30.170 --> 03:19:30.180 align:start position:0%
to encourage our students to choose a
 
03:19:31.910 --> 03:19:31.920 align:start position:0%
future in these very rewarding fields
 
03:19:34.610 --> 03:19:34.620 align:start position:0%
and stay in work here in the state of
 
03:19:35.870 --> 03:19:35.880 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
03:19:38.809 --> 03:19:38.819 align:start position:0%
and we recently secured another round of
 
03:19:40.429 --> 03:19:40.439 align:start position:0%
State opioid grants an amazing
 
03:19:43.130 --> 03:19:43.140 align:start position:0%
opportunity over 50 million dollars over
 
03:19:45.110 --> 03:19:45.120 align:start position:0%
the next couple of years a testament to
 
03:19:47.150 --> 03:19:47.160 align:start position:0%
the doorway system that we've built to
 
03:19:49.730 --> 03:19:49.740 align:start position:0%
ensure the wrap around wrap around rural
 
03:19:51.889 --> 03:19:51.899 align:start position:0%

are always there for our citizens
 
03:19:58.610 --> 03:19:58.620 align:start position:0%
additionally we're putting more
 
03:20:00.290 --> 03:20:00.300 align:start position:0%
resources than ever before into our
 
03:20:02.510 --> 03:20:02.520 align:start position:0%
recovery friendly workplace initiative
 
03:20:04.670 --> 03:20:04.680 align:start position:0%
which has not only outpaced its growth
 
03:20:06.710 --> 03:20:06.720 align:start position:0%
in our state but just last week our team
 
03:20:09.230 --> 03:20:09.240 align:start position:0%
was presenting to all 50 states across
 
03:20:11.090 --> 03:20:11.100 align:start position:0%
the country many of which who have
 
03:20:13.130 --> 03:20:13.140 align:start position:0%
already adopted this program the
 
03:20:14.690 --> 03:20:14.700 align:start position:0%
recovery-friendly workplace initiative
 
03:20:16.790 --> 03:20:16.800 align:start position:0%
it's going National it's very exciting
 
03:20:18.469 --> 03:20:18.479 align:start position:0%
and we in New Hampshire are doubling our
 
03:20:20.269 --> 03:20:20.279 align:start position:0%
efforts to help ensure that everyone
 
03:20:22.429 --> 03:20:22.439 align:start position:0%
with this disease has a chance to work
 
03:20:24.410 --> 03:20:24.420 align:start position:0%
and contribute
 
03:20:26.030 --> 03:20:26.040 align:start position:0%
now none of these great efforts are
 
03:20:27.830 --> 03:20:27.840 align:start position:0%
possible without people right it always
 
03:20:29.690 --> 03:20:29.700 align:start position:0%
comes back to people so we are
 
03:20:31.070 --> 03:20:31.080 align:start position:0%
acknowledging the countless health care
 
03:20:32.690 --> 03:20:32.700 align:start position:0%

on top of that initial 100 million
 
03:21:02.510 --> 03:21:02.520 align:start position:0%
dollar Grant we're dedicating an
 
03:21:04.370 --> 03:21:04.380 align:start position:0%
additional 30 million dollars to invest
 
03:21:06.830 --> 03:21:06.840 align:start position:0%
in h to help meet those demands and
 
03:21:08.210 --> 03:21:08.220 align:start position:0%
we're increasing our investments into

the affordable housing fund by 25

continue to be there for them

underway this past year in Franklin
 
03:21:46.670 --> 03:21:46.680 align:start position:0%
and the Investments that we're making in
 
03:21:48.469 --> 03:21:48.479 align:start position:0%
Workforce in this budget will help
 
03:21:50.570 --> 03:21:50.580 align:start position:0%
ensure that there are that there are
 
03:21:52.969 --> 03:21:52.979 align:start position:0%
individuals trained licensed and ready
 
03:21:54.769 --> 03:21:54.779 align:start position:0%
to assist our veterans on this campus
 
03:21:57.469 --> 03:21:57.479 align:start position:0%
and then our state's veterans home we've
 
03:22:00.530 --> 03:22:00.540 align:start position:0%
included a new allocation of 8.4 million
 
03:22:01.969 --> 03:22:01.979 align:start position:0%
dollars for the Department of military
 
03:22:04.790 --> 03:22:04.800 align:start position:0%

Hampshire's National Guard throughout
 
03:22:07.849 --> 03:22:07.859 align:start position:0%
the pandemic we saw him every day on TV
 
03:22:09.769 --> 03:22:09.779 align:start position:0%
and we must now ensure that they have
 
03:22:11.809 --> 03:22:11.819 align:start position:0%
the resources in place to complete their
 
03:22:11.819 --> 03:22:19.730 align:start position:0%
the resources in place to complete their
missions

03:22:19.730 --> 03:22:19.740 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:21.769 --> 03:22:21.779 align:start position:0%
smart budgeting and fifth responsibility
 
03:22:24.110 --> 03:22:24.120 align:start position:0%
comes the opportunity to use State
 
03:22:27.110 --> 03:22:27.120 align:start position:0%
surplus funds for Capital Investments we
 
03:22:28.790 --> 03:22:28.800 align:start position:0%
cannot and should not rely on these
 
03:22:31.429 --> 03:22:31.439 align:start position:0%
one-time funds for long-term programs
 
03:22:33.050 --> 03:22:33.060 align:start position:0%
that would create huge problems down the
 
03:22:35.330 --> 03:22:35.340 align:start position:0%
road too many states actually get caught
 
03:22:37.610 --> 03:22:37.620 align:start position:0%
up in those one-time windfalls and they
 
03:22:39.530 --> 03:22:39.540 align:start position:0%
create unsustainable government programs
 
03:22:41.690 --> 03:22:41.700 align:start position:0%
that then must be funded by higher taxes
 
03:22:43.849 --> 03:22:43.859 align:start position:0%
on their citizens in the future that
 
03:22:46.429 --> 03:22:46.439 align:start position:0%
kind of buy now buy now pay later
 
03:22:48.710 --> 03:22:48.720 align:start position:0%
mentality it's just not how we do things
 
03:22:49.969 --> 03:22:49.979 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire which means that we
 
03:22:52.130 --> 03:22:52.140 align:start position:0%
spend one-time revenue on one-time
 
03:22:54.889 --> 03:22:54.899 align:start position:0%
projects and by budgeting accordingly we
 
03:22:56.929 --> 03:22:56.939 align:start position:0%
avoid irresponsibility growing the size
 
03:22:58.969 --> 03:22:58.979 align:start position:0%
of government and burning our taxpayers
 
03:23:00.830 --> 03:23:00.840 align:start position:0%
with long-term liabilities
 
03:23:02.450 --> 03:23:02.460 align:start position:0%
so with the numerous one-time
 
03:23:04.250 --> 03:23:04.260 align:start position:0%
infrastructure Investments that this
 
03:23:06.110 --> 03:23:06.120 align:start position:0%
budget proposes and that the capital
 
03:23:08.750 --> 03:23:08.760 align:start position:0%
budget also includes we'll be adding
 
03:23:11.870 --> 03:23:11.880 align:start position:0%
approximately 180 million dollars to the
 
03:23:13.849 --> 03:23:13.859 align:start position:0%
rainy day fund by the close of fiscal
 
03:23:17.330 --> 03:23:17.340 align:start position:0%
year 25. building up our reserves I will
 
03:23:17.760 --> 03:23:17.770 align:start position:0%
take that
 
03:23:17.770 --> 03:23:24.710 align:start position:0%
take that
[Applause]

03:23:24.710 --> 03:23:24.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:26.570 --> 03:23:26.580 align:start position:0%
that lies ahead of us as strong as we
 
03:23:28.070 --> 03:23:28.080 align:start position:0%
are today we're already seeing it
 
03:23:29.450 --> 03:23:29.460 align:start position:0%
flounder in other parts of the country
 
03:23:31.670 --> 03:23:31.680 align:start position:0%
and it is critical to build up those
 
03:23:33.950 --> 03:23:33.960 align:start position:0%
reserves going during good times that
 
03:23:35.510 --> 03:23:35.520 align:start position:0%
we're currently experiencing to ensure
 
03:23:37.910 --> 03:23:37.920 align:start position:0%
that any future downturns that may
 
03:23:39.889 --> 03:23:39.899 align:start position:0%
impact the state are at the smallest
 
03:23:41.929 --> 03:23:41.939 align:start position:0%
degree possible
 
03:23:44.510 --> 03:23:44.520 align:start position:0%
and lastly before we close out
 
03:23:45.769 --> 03:23:45.779 align:start position:0%
I got to get something really
 
03:23:45.779 --> 03:23:47.210 align:start position:0%
I got to get something really
controversial

03:23:47.210 --> 03:23:47.220 align:start position:0%
controversial
 
03:23:49.130 --> 03:23:49.140 align:start position:0%
it's not that controversial but it's
 
03:23:51.650 --> 03:23:51.660 align:start position:0%
hard right it's a big challenge
 
03:23:53.090 --> 03:23:53.100 align:start position:0%
this budget continues
 
03:23:55.070 --> 03:23:55.080 align:start position:0%
continued a message to businesses across
 
03:23:56.809 --> 03:23:56.819 align:start position:0%
the country that New Hampshire will
 
03:23:58.610 --> 03:23:58.620 align:start position:0%
remain a hub of innovation and here in
 
03:24:00.769 --> 03:24:00.779 align:start position:0%
the granite state we listen to and we
 
03:24:02.450 --> 03:24:02.460 align:start position:0%
work with the businesses that are the
 
03:24:04.190 --> 03:24:04.200 align:start position:0%
Bedrock of our communities
 
03:24:06.050 --> 03:24:06.060 align:start position:0%
after years of cutting thousands of
 
03:24:08.389 --> 03:24:08.399 align:start position:0%
pieces of big government red tape we
 
03:24:10.790 --> 03:24:10.800 align:start position:0%
continue to find in efficiencies and to
 
03:24:12.950 --> 03:24:12.960 align:start position:0%
streamline improvements to the office of
 
03:24:14.990 --> 03:24:15.000 align:start position:0%
professional licensure and certification
 
03:24:17.630 --> 03:24:17.640 align:start position:0%
we call it oplc
 
03:24:19.190 --> 03:24:19.200 align:start position:0%
this budget includes Landmark
 
03:24:21.729 --> 03:24:21.739 align:start position:0%
legislation to Grant Universal license
 
03:24:24.590 --> 03:24:24.600 align:start position:0%
recognition for the professions in New
 
03:24:26.510 --> 03:24:26.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that require a license if you
 
03:24:28.729 --> 03:24:28.739 align:start position:0%
have a substantially similar license and
 
03:24:30.290 --> 03:24:30.300 align:start position:0%
you're in good standing in another state
 
03:24:32.330 --> 03:24:32.340 align:start position:0%
there's no reason you should not have a
 
03:24:42.050 --> 03:24:42.060 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:44.210 --> 03:24:44.220 align:start position:0%
if a small business owner needs a
 
03:24:46.070 --> 03:24:46.080 align:start position:0%
license to do their job or operate their
 
03:24:47.990 --> 03:24:48.000 align:start position:0%
business in the current state New
 
03:24:49.670 --> 03:24:49.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire will recognize their license
 
03:24:51.830 --> 03:24:51.840 align:start position:0%
right here incentivizing working
 
03:24:53.929 --> 03:24:53.939 align:start position:0%
professionals Across the Nation to move
 
03:24:56.090 --> 03:24:56.100 align:start position:0%
here and be part of our success now it
 
03:24:58.370 --> 03:24:58.380 align:start position:0%
will not be easy I appreciate that we're
 
03:25:00.769 --> 03:25:00.779 align:start position:0%
fighting very entrenched politically
 
03:25:02.450 --> 03:25:02.460 align:start position:0%
connected bureaucracies that's the way
 
03:25:04.250 --> 03:25:04.260 align:start position:0%
it always is anytime this issue comes up
 
03:25:06.229 --> 03:25:06.239 align:start position:0%
and they tend to want to stifle
 
03:25:08.809 --> 03:25:08.819 align:start position:0%
competition but that is not the
 
03:25:10.969 --> 03:25:10.979 align:start position:0%
embodiment of who we are in the Live
 
03:25:13.130 --> 03:25:13.140 align:start position:0%
Free or Die state it is not in our
 
03:25:13.140 --> 03:25:14.030 align:start position:0%
Free or Die state it is not in our
spirit

03:25:14.030 --> 03:25:14.040 align:start position:0%
spirit
 
03:25:16.729 --> 03:25:16.739 align:start position:0%
I am proposing to fully remove 34
 
03:25:18.530 --> 03:25:18.540 align:start position:0%
different outdated licenses from state
 
03:25:21.290 --> 03:25:21.300 align:start position:0%
government eliminate 14 underutilized
 
03:25:24.050 --> 03:25:24.060 align:start position:0%
regulatory boards and almost 700
 
03:25:26.780 --> 03:25:26.790 align:start position:0%
unnecessary statutory provisions
 
03:25:26.790 --> 03:25:31.070 align:start position:0%
unnecessary statutory provisions
[Applause]

03:25:31.070 --> 03:25:31.080 align:start position:0%
[Applause]
 
03:25:33.469 --> 03:25:33.479 align:start position:0%
doesn't license the contractor who
 
03:25:34.849 --> 03:25:34.859 align:start position:0%
frames your house
 
03:25:37.010 --> 03:25:37.020 align:start position:0%
but for some reason we licensed the guy
 
03:25:40.070 --> 03:25:40.080 align:start position:0%
who's going to put a rose bush out front
 
03:25:42.889 --> 03:25:42.899 align:start position:0%
think about that
 
03:25:44.030 --> 03:25:44.040 align:start position:0%
not anymore
 
03:25:46.250 --> 03:25:46.260 align:start position:0%
let's remember who we are let's remember
 
03:25:48.050 --> 03:25:48.060 align:start position:0%
it is about individual freedom and
 
03:25:50.150 --> 03:25:50.160 align:start position:0%
opportunity and opening our businesses
 
03:25:52.309 --> 03:25:52.319 align:start position:0%
to everyone less red tape and more
 
03:25:53.809 --> 03:25:53.819 align:start position:0%
common sense that's how we grow our
 
03:25:55.729 --> 03:25:55.739 align:start position:0%
economy that is truly the New Hampshire
 
03:25:55.739 --> 03:25:56.809 align:start position:0%
economy that is truly the New Hampshire
way

03:25:56.809 --> 03:25:56.819 align:start position:0%
way
 
03:25:58.550 --> 03:25:58.560 align:start position:0%
furthermore my budget creates an
 
03:26:00.710 --> 03:26:00.720 align:start position:0%
independent office of regulatory review
 
03:26:02.809 --> 03:26:02.819 align:start position:0%
and government efficiency to be a
 
03:26:04.849 --> 03:26:04.859 align:start position:0%
watchdog to eliminate and prevent
 
03:26:07.370 --> 03:26:07.380 align:start position:0%
frivolous rules and regulations as well
 
03:26:09.110 --> 03:26:09.120 align:start position:0%
as to find efficiencies within state
 
03:26:11.150 --> 03:26:11.160 align:start position:0%
government we're committed to breaking
 
03:26:13.010 --> 03:26:13.020 align:start position:0%
down regulatory batteries we want to
 
03:26:14.570 --> 03:26:14.580 align:start position:0%
lower the cost of Entry to do business
 
03:26:16.610 --> 03:26:16.620 align:start position:0%
here increase free market competition
 
03:26:18.769 --> 03:26:18.779 align:start position:0%
and signaling to the rest of America
 
03:26:21.410 --> 03:26:21.420 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire truly
 
03:26:24.889 --> 03:26:24.899 align:start position:0%
in America for economic freedom
 
03:26:26.630 --> 03:26:26.640 align:start position:0%
now in the next few months I obviously
 
03:26:28.130 --> 03:26:28.140 align:start position:0%
look forward to working with all of you
 
03:26:30.229 --> 03:26:30.239 align:start position:0%
very closely with members of both
 
03:26:32.389 --> 03:26:32.399 align:start position:0%
parties as we deliver for the people of
 
03:26:34.790 --> 03:26:34.800 align:start position:0%
our state and we can deliver to them a
 
03:26:36.590 --> 03:26:36.600 align:start position:0%
fiscally responsible balanced budget
 
03:26:39.290 --> 03:26:39.300 align:start position:0%
with no new taxes and no new fees we're
 
03:26:41.150 --> 03:26:41.160 align:start position:0%
here to Design Systems we create
 
03:26:43.610 --> 03:26:43.620 align:start position:0%
efficiencies we put people over programs
 
03:26:46.070 --> 03:26:46.080 align:start position:0%
and deliver results for citizens who
 
03:26:48.349 --> 03:26:48.359 align:start position:0%
sent us to Concord in the first place we
 
03:26:50.330 --> 03:26:50.340 align:start position:0%
cannot let this budget be hijacked by
 
03:26:52.429 --> 03:26:52.439 align:start position:0%
politics and we cannot let this budget
 
03:26:54.349 --> 03:26:54.359 align:start position:0%
serve as a vehicle for partisan
 
03:26:56.210 --> 03:26:56.220 align:start position:0%
maneuvering it must be about the
 
03:26:57.830 --> 03:26:57.840 align:start position:0%
individual our employees our children
 
03:27:00.469 --> 03:27:00.479 align:start position:0%
and our taxpayers Washington is broken
 
03:27:02.690 --> 03:27:02.700 align:start position:0%
we see it every night on the news they
 
03:27:04.190 --> 03:27:04.200 align:start position:0%
can manage they can barely manage to
 
03:27:06.170 --> 03:27:06.180 align:start position:0%
keep the government running but that is
 
03:27:08.090 --> 03:27:08.100 align:start position:0%
not how we do it in New Hampshire we are
 
03:27:09.889 --> 03:27:09.899 align:start position:0%
the standard that they're constantly
 
03:27:12.110 --> 03:27:12.120 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out how do we do it how
 
03:27:14.510 --> 03:27:14.520 align:start position:0%
do you guys get it done are citizens
 
03:27:16.190 --> 03:27:16.200 align:start position:0%
demand that level of excellence and
 
03:27:19.130 --> 03:27:19.140 align:start position:0%
accountability and that transparency the
 
03:27:20.570 --> 03:27:20.580 align:start position:0%
fact that we all go back to our
 
03:27:22.910 --> 03:27:22.920 align:start position:0%
communities and answer questions they
 
03:27:24.650 --> 03:27:24.660 align:start position:0%
have all our cell numbers it seems like
 
03:27:26.210 --> 03:27:26.220 align:start position:0%
every one has mine I'm sure they all
 
03:27:29.090 --> 03:27:29.100 align:start position:0%
have yours as well but that sense of
 
03:27:30.710 --> 03:27:30.720 align:start position:0%
connectedness transparency and
 
03:27:33.050 --> 03:27:33.060 align:start position:0%
accessibility is truly what keeps us
 
03:27:36.170 --> 03:27:36.180 align:start position:0%
apart from the rest of the nation
 
03:27:38.690 --> 03:27:38.700 align:start position:0%
and that type of accountability is what
 
03:27:40.670 --> 03:27:40.680 align:start position:0%
we're going to deliver with this budget
 
03:27:42.950 --> 03:27:42.960 align:start position:0%
good luck it's not going to be easy it's
 
03:27:44.690 --> 03:27:44.700 align:start position:0%
going to be a lot of hard work we're all
 
03:27:46.670 --> 03:27:46.680 align:start position:0%
in it together but I have full faith and
 
03:27:49.389 --> 03:27:49.399 align:start position:0%
confidence as a team
 
03:27:52.550 --> 03:27:52.560 align:start position:0%

03:31:19.429 --> 03:31:19.439 align:start position:0%
um number one the police are in support
 
03:31:21.410 --> 03:31:21.420 align:start position:0%
of this bill
 
03:31:23.929 --> 03:31:23.939 align:start position:0%
um this is a common sense bill that not
 
03:31:26.330 --> 03:31:26.340 align:start position:0%
only protects human safety it protects
 
03:31:29.030 --> 03:31:29.040 align:start position:0%
animal safety as well
 
03:31:32.030 --> 03:31:32.040 align:start position:0%
um there are distracted driving laws but
 
03:31:34.190 --> 03:31:34.200 align:start position:0%
they're based on the discretion of the
 
03:31:34.200 --> 03:31:35.269 align:start position:0%
they're based on the discretion of the
officer

03:31:35.269 --> 03:31:35.279 align:start position:0%
officer
 
03:31:39.110 --> 03:31:39.120 align:start position:0%
this bill simply States you cannot have
 
03:31:42.650 --> 03:31:42.660 align:start position:0%
an animal on the person so I can't drive
 
03:31:46.130 --> 03:31:46.140 align:start position:0%
around with my dog on my lap
 
03:31:47.690 --> 03:31:47.700 align:start position:0%
um there's been many examples where
 
03:31:50.690 --> 03:31:50.700 align:start position:0%
people drive with dogs on their laps and
 
03:31:53.870 --> 03:31:53.880 align:start position:0%
they're too busy pedophile next thing
 
03:31:55.670 --> 03:31:55.680 align:start position:0%
you know they're in a motor vehicle
 
03:31:58.550 --> 03:31:58.560 align:start position:0%
accident the air bear goes off and
 
03:32:01.429 --> 03:32:01.439 align:start position:0%
unfortunately the dog passes away
 
03:32:03.590 --> 03:32:03.600 align:start position:0%
um a 10-pound dog
 
03:32:07.309 --> 03:32:07.319 align:start position:0%
would be succumbed to 300 pounds of
 
03:32:10.309 --> 03:32:10.319 align:start position:0%
pressure from a deflated airbag
 
03:32:14.290 --> 03:32:14.300 align:start position:0%
which would instantaneously kill the dog
 
03:32:18.349 --> 03:32:18.359 align:start position:0%
other states do have similar laws but
 
03:32:21.710 --> 03:32:21.720 align:start position:0%
they have so many restrictions on it so
 
03:32:24.349 --> 03:32:24.359 align:start position:0%
they require require a restraint on your
 
03:32:26.090 --> 03:32:26.100 align:start position:0%
dog so they would have to be buckled in
 
03:32:28.370 --> 03:32:28.380 align:start position:0%
or some sort of collar attached to their
 
03:32:30.469 --> 03:32:30.479 align:start position:0%
seat belt
 
03:32:33.349 --> 03:32:33.359 align:start position:0%
um some also require the animal to be in
 
03:32:37.790 --> 03:32:37.800 align:start position:0%
a crate while they are transported this
 
03:32:40.969 --> 03:32:40.979 align:start position:0%
bill does none of that this bill simply
 
03:32:44.229 --> 03:32:44.239 align:start position:0%
States your dog or your cat or your bird
 
03:32:47.210 --> 03:32:47.220 align:start position:0%
cannot sit on your lap while you are
 
03:32:50.030 --> 03:32:50.040 align:start position:0%
driving a motor vehicle it's as simple
 
03:32:51.889 --> 03:32:51.899 align:start position:0%
as that it's for the safety of the
 
03:32:53.570 --> 03:32:53.580 align:start position:0%
animal it's for the safety of
 
03:32:55.550 --> 03:32:55.560 align:start position:0%
pedestrians it's the safety of the
 
03:32:55.560 --> 03:32:57.170 align:start position:0%
pedestrians it's the safety of the
driver

03:32:57.170 --> 03:32:57.180 align:start position:0%
driver
 
03:32:59.510 --> 03:32:59.520 align:start position:0%
um a lot of people a lot of
 
03:33:01.790 --> 03:33:01.800 align:start position:0%
misconceptions of this bill saying that
 
03:33:04.849 --> 03:33:04.859 align:start position:0%
a animal would not be allowed in the
 
03:33:07.309 --> 03:33:07.319 align:start position:0%
vehicle with the dog that is false
 
03:33:10.790 --> 03:33:10.800 align:start position:0%
information nowhere in this bill does it
 
03:33:13.550 --> 03:33:13.560 align:start position:0%
State you cannot travel with your animal
 
03:33:17.210 --> 03:33:17.220 align:start position:0%
the animal just cannot be on your lap
 
03:33:20.090 --> 03:33:20.100 align:start position:0%
simple as that is for the safety of
 
03:33:22.429 --> 03:33:22.439 align:start position:0%
everyone including your beloved backpack
 
03:33:24.950 --> 03:33:24.960 align:start position:0%
I can't tell you how many times I drive
 
03:33:27.170 --> 03:33:27.180 align:start position:0%
around and I see people driving with
 
03:33:29.030 --> 03:33:29.040 align:start position:0%
their dog on their lap and it's head
 
03:33:31.849 --> 03:33:31.859 align:start position:0%
hanging out the driver's side window
 
03:33:33.769 --> 03:33:33.779 align:start position:0%
it's just not safe also with the window
 
03:33:36.530 --> 03:33:36.540 align:start position:0%
open that much and a smaller dog that
 
03:33:38.450 --> 03:33:38.460 align:start position:0%
can fit on your lap you have the
 
03:33:39.950 --> 03:33:39.960 align:start position:0%
potential of the dog jumping out the
 
03:33:41.510 --> 03:33:41.520 align:start position:0%
window as well which
 
03:33:43.570 --> 03:33:43.580 align:start position:0%
probably isn't wise
 
03:33:46.690 --> 03:33:46.700 align:start position:0%
we have received multiple emails
 
03:33:49.429 --> 03:33:49.439 align:start position:0%
recently in regards to this bill of
 
03:33:52.550 --> 03:33:52.560 align:start position:0%
people that were previously against it
 
03:33:55.010 --> 03:33:55.020 align:start position:0%
that are now for the bill after reading
 
03:33:56.630 --> 03:33:56.640 align:start position:0%
it and understanding the purpose of the
 
03:33:56.640 --> 03:33:57.550 align:start position:0%
it and understanding the purpose of the
bill

03:33:57.550 --> 03:33:57.560 align:start position:0%
bill
 
03:34:01.729 --> 03:34:01.739 align:start position:0%
this bill again does not restrict
 
03:34:05.030 --> 03:34:05.040 align:start position:0%
driving anywhere with your pet
 
03:34:07.729 --> 03:34:07.739 align:start position:0%
so I don't want anybody to assume that
 
03:34:10.210 --> 03:34:10.220 align:start position:0%
um overall I think this is a great bill
 
03:34:13.429 --> 03:34:13.439 align:start position:0%
it focuses on the safety of the owner
 
03:34:16.130 --> 03:34:16.140 align:start position:0%
and the animal and I highly recommend
 
03:34:19.610 --> 03:34:19.620 align:start position:0%
everybody votes against the itl motion
 
03:34:22.790 --> 03:34:22.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:22.800 --> 03:34:24.290 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

03:34:24.290 --> 03:34:24.300 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
03:34:35.570 --> 03:34:35.580 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:38.590 --> 03:34:38.600 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
03:34:41.389 --> 03:34:41.399 align:start position:0%
fellows Representatives thank you for
 
03:34:44.389 --> 03:34:44.399 align:start position:0%
taking the time to listen in my
 
03:34:48.769 --> 03:34:48.779 align:start position:0%
report here as far as I want to EA on
 
03:34:48.779 --> 03:34:50.450 align:start position:0%
report here as far as I want to EA on
itl

03:34:50.450 --> 03:34:50.460 align:start position:0%
itl
 
03:34:52.849 --> 03:34:52.859 align:start position:0%
all right this this is just a very short
 
03:34:55.250 --> 03:34:55.260 align:start position:0%
bill it's a one-off bill and it's going
 
03:34:57.889 --> 03:34:57.899 align:start position:0%
to be put another burden on the police
 
03:35:00.170 --> 03:35:00.180 align:start position:0%
officer to be looking over everybody's
 
03:35:02.210 --> 03:35:02.220 align:start position:0%
shoulder to see if someone has a pet in
 
03:35:03.889 --> 03:35:03.899 align:start position:0%
their lap or looking out the window or
 
03:35:05.269 --> 03:35:05.279 align:start position:0%
something like that
 
03:35:08.330 --> 03:35:08.340 align:start position:0%
but at this point here even though this
 
03:35:10.490 --> 03:35:10.500 align:start position:0%
bill has Merit and its heartfelt
 
03:35:12.710 --> 03:35:12.720 align:start position:0%
testimony was given New Hampshire should
 
03:35:14.210 --> 03:35:14.220 align:start position:0%
not be creating another one-off bill
 
03:35:17.990 --> 03:35:18.000 align:start position:0%
during our committee no statistical data
 
03:35:21.710 --> 03:35:21.720 align:start position:0%
was given to back up the testimony
 
03:35:25.790 --> 03:35:25.800 align:start position:0%
um in passing this bill would also
 
03:35:28.190 --> 03:35:28.200 align:start position:0%
allow for a traffic stop or a citizen
 
03:35:31.309 --> 03:35:31.319 align:start position:0%
even though they are not driving in an
 
03:35:36.110 --> 03:35:36.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:37.849 --> 03:35:37.859 align:start position:0%
for example
 
03:35:40.250 --> 03:35:40.260 align:start position:0%
you know he could actually look at this
 
03:35:41.630 --> 03:35:41.640 align:start position:0%
and say
 
03:35:44.210 --> 03:35:44.220 align:start position:0%
we have a
 
03:35:46.309 --> 03:35:46.319 align:start position:0%
a pet and a lap bill
 
03:35:48.110 --> 03:35:48.120 align:start position:0%
but then we're going to have well I
 
03:35:51.290 --> 03:35:51.300 align:start position:0%
passed a pacifier to my baby how about
 
03:35:53.269 --> 03:35:53.279 align:start position:0%
if I'm drinking a beverage in the car I
 
03:35:55.429 --> 03:35:55.439 align:start position:0%
eat a sandwich in the car I'm using
 
03:35:57.830 --> 03:35:57.840 align:start position:0%
vehicle controls we're going to have
 
03:36:00.110 --> 03:36:00.120 align:start position:0%
Bill after Bill after Bill and that's
 
03:36:01.670 --> 03:36:01.680 align:start position:0%
why I'm saying this bill should actually
 
03:36:04.070 --> 03:36:04.080 align:start position:0%
be itl and actually I'm going to ask you
 
03:36:06.229 --> 03:36:06.239 align:start position:0%
to trust the citizens of New Hampshire
 
03:36:08.450 --> 03:36:08.460 align:start position:0%
and let them know and let government
 
03:36:11.990 --> 03:36:12.000 align:start position:0%
stay out of intruding and infringing on
 
03:36:14.809 --> 03:36:14.819 align:start position:0%
their lives and say yay and I TL this
 
03:36:14.819 --> 03:36:23.570 align:start position:0%
their lives and say yay and I TL this
bill

03:36:23.570 --> 03:36:23.580 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:26.690 --> 03:36:26.700 align:start position:0%
the question before us is the majority

chair recognizes representative Eaton

03:38:02.389 --> 03:38:02.399 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker if I know the only one who
 
03:38:05.389 --> 03:38:05.399 align:start position:0%
should be in a driver's seat at any time
 
03:38:07.610 --> 03:38:07.620 align:start position:0%
a vehicle is going down the road is a
 
03:38:07.620 --> 03:38:08.630 align:start position:0%
a vehicle is going down the road is a
driver

03:38:08.630 --> 03:38:08.640 align:start position:0%
driver
 
03:38:11.389 --> 03:38:11.399 align:start position:0%
and Mr Speaker if I know that an animal
 
03:38:13.610 --> 03:38:13.620 align:start position:0%
in a passenger seat can have a
 
03:38:16.790 --> 03:38:16.800 align:start position:0%
catastrophic effect on the airbag on
 
03:38:20.210 --> 03:38:20.220 align:start position:0%
both animal and driver and Mr Speaker if
 
03:38:23.330 --> 03:38:23.340 align:start position:0%
I care about the motoring public if I
 
03:38:27.650 --> 03:38:27.660 align:start position:0%
care about my family if I care about our
 
03:38:29.330 --> 03:38:29.340 align:start position:0%
four-legged family
 
03:38:32.450 --> 03:38:32.460 align:start position:0%
and want to protect them all and in 20
 
03:38:35.090 --> 03:38:35.100 align:start position:0%
years of law enforcement know this has
 
03:38:36.950 --> 03:38:36.960 align:start position:0%
become a progressively greater problem
 
03:38:39.769 --> 03:38:39.779 align:start position:0%
over the years what I now vote know on
 
03:38:41.690 --> 03:38:41.700 align:start position:0%
the itl Motions so another motion could
 
03:38:44.750 --> 03:38:44.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:46.610 --> 03:38:46.620 align:start position:0%
chair recognize representative Waltz for
 
03:38:51.950 --> 03:38:51.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:53.769 --> 03:38:53.779 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
03:38:56.750 --> 03:38:56.760 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker if I know that this bill just
 
03:38:59.090 --> 03:38:59.100 align:start position:0%
singles out one possible distraction of
 
03:39:01.250 --> 03:39:01.260 align:start position:0%
many and after 20 years of commuting to
 
03:39:03.170 --> 03:39:03.180 align:start position:0%
Boston there are a lot of things going
 
03:39:04.309 --> 03:39:04.319 align:start position:0%
on out there
 
03:39:07.309 --> 03:39:07.319 align:start position:0%
if I also know Mr Speaker that there's
 
03:39:09.290 --> 03:39:09.300 align:start position:0%
only one state that has this type of
 
03:39:11.809 --> 03:39:11.819 align:start position:0%
prohibition and that is Hawaii I didn't
 
03:39:14.330 --> 03:39:14.340 align:start position:0%
know we ever tried to emulate them and
 
03:39:15.769 --> 03:39:15.779 align:start position:0%
finally Mr Speaker
 
03:39:17.929 --> 03:39:17.939 align:start position:0%
if it's determined currently under law
 
03:39:20.210 --> 03:39:20.220 align:start position:0%
if a pet on your lab causes an accident
 
03:39:22.670 --> 03:39:22.680 align:start position:0%
you can be charged with negligence so
 
03:39:24.710 --> 03:39:24.720 align:start position:0%
it's not like the law is silent would

members of the House colleagues
 
03:41:44.090 --> 03:41:44.100 align:start position:0%
I'm going to go a little bit out of
 
03:41:47.750 --> 03:41:47.760 align:start position:0%
pattern today as I talk about this bill
 
03:41:50.510 --> 03:41:50.520 align:start position:0%
the first thing I want to talk about is
 
03:41:54.710 --> 03:41:54.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:57.110 --> 03:41:57.120 align:start position:0%
a person left his country
 
03:41:59.870 --> 03:41:59.880 align:start position:0%
where there was violence
 
03:41:59.880 --> 03:42:02.510 align:start position:0%
where there was violence
and

03:42:02.510 --> 03:42:02.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:42:04.849 --> 03:42:04.859 align:start position:0%
economic hard times
 
03:42:04.859 --> 03:42:06.229 align:start position:0%
economic hard times
and

03:42:06.229 --> 03:42:06.239 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:42:08.630 --> 03:42:08.640 align:start position:0%
he was an adopted child so he didn't
 
03:42:10.610 --> 03:42:10.620 align:start position:0%
quite fit in
 
03:42:13.130 --> 03:42:13.140 align:start position:0%
and he made his way to this country
 
03:42:19.550 --> 03:42:19.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:20.770 --> 03:42:20.780 align:start position:0%
upon arrival
 
03:42:20.780 --> 03:42:22.190 align:start position:0%
upon arrival

[Music]
 
03:42:24.410 --> 03:42:24.420 align:start position:0%
he then got a job
 
03:42:27.650 --> 03:42:27.660 align:start position:0%
shoveling coal by hand
 
03:42:30.469 --> 03:42:30.479 align:start position:0%

Island
 
03:42:35.929 --> 03:42:35.939 align:start position:0%
from there
 
03:42:38.030 --> 03:42:38.040 align:start position:0%
he went and raised enough money for
 
03:42:41.870 --> 03:42:41.880 align:start position:0%
himself to purchase a farm in 1900.
 
03:42:43.910 --> 03:42:43.920 align:start position:0%
that's the farm that he
 
03:42:47.870 --> 03:42:47.880 align:start position:0%
worked and stayed in until he died his
 
03:42:50.030 --> 03:42:50.040 align:start position:0%
son my grandfather
 
03:42:53.150 --> 03:42:53.160 align:start position:0%
was born in that building and I lived in
 
03:42:55.250 --> 03:42:55.260 align:start position:0%
that building and at that farm
 
03:42:58.010 --> 03:42:58.020 align:start position:0%
up until my teens
 
03:43:00.229 --> 03:43:00.239 align:start position:0%
I brought this little bit of History to
 
03:43:01.729 --> 03:43:01.739 align:start position:0%
you because
 
03:43:05.510 --> 03:43:05.520 align:start position:0%
I want you to think about this fact
 
03:43:08.990 --> 03:43:09.000 align:start position:0%
this bill that I've introduced before
 
03:43:12.170 --> 03:43:12.180 align:start position:0%
has an arc of history and the Arc of
 
03:43:16.010 --> 03:43:16.020 align:start position:0%
history is that as time has come along
 
03:43:18.650 --> 03:43:18.660 align:start position:0%
more and more people have seen its
 
03:43:21.229 --> 03:43:21.239 align:start position:0%
wisdom so now I would call to your
 
03:43:23.030 --> 03:43:23.040 align:start position:0%
attention some of the following points
 
03:43:25.969 --> 03:43:25.979 align:start position:0%
that I would like to make about why this
 
03:43:28.790 --> 03:43:28.800 align:start position:0%
bill is a public safety issue and has
 
03:43:28.800 --> 03:43:33.710 align:start position:0%
bill is a public safety issue and has
wisdom

03:43:33.710 --> 03:43:33.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:38.269 --> 03:43:38.279 align:start position:0%
there are probably probably fourteen
 
03:43:40.790 --> 03:43:40.800 align:start position:0%
thousand undocumented folks here in this
 
03:43:40.800 --> 03:43:44.210 align:start position:0%
thousand undocumented folks here in this
state

03:43:44.210 --> 03:43:44.220 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:47.389 --> 03:43:47.399 align:start position:0%
when you arrive without documentation it
 
03:43:49.729 --> 03:43:49.739 align:start position:0%
isn't always because you wanted to it
 
03:43:51.349 --> 03:43:51.359 align:start position:0%
could be that your parents brought you
 
03:43:51.359 --> 03:43:53.170 align:start position:0%
could be that your parents brought you
here

03:43:53.170 --> 03:43:53.180 align:start position:0%
here
 
03:43:58.849 --> 03:43:58.859 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:01.670 --> 03:44:01.680 align:start position:0%
but the ability to drive and the ability
 
03:44:04.190 --> 03:44:04.200 align:start position:0%
to prove that you know how to drive and
 
03:44:07.010 --> 03:44:07.020 align:start position:0%
that you are a good driver is an
 
03:44:10.010 --> 03:44:10.020 align:start position:0%
important state prerequisite and it's
 
03:44:12.950 --> 03:44:12.960 align:start position:0%
important for Public Safety to
 
03:44:16.309 --> 03:44:16.319 align:start position:0%
have people take that driver's test
 
03:44:20.150 --> 03:44:20.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:22.670 --> 03:44:22.680 align:start position:0%
this bill does not Grant any privileges
 
03:44:28.370 --> 03:44:28.380 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:30.830 --> 03:44:30.840 align:start position:0%
there were there have been
 
03:44:33.530 --> 03:44:33.540 align:start position:0%
20 States and two other political
 
03:44:35.450 --> 03:44:35.460 align:start position:0%
entities here in the United States that
 
03:44:37.849 --> 03:44:37.859 align:start position:0%
have already passed this bill when I
 
03:44:40.429 --> 03:44:40.439 align:start position:0%
first introduced this bill it was fewer
 
03:44:43.550 --> 03:44:43.560 align:start position:0%
than 10. that's where I get that the Arc
 
03:44:52.309 --> 03:44:52.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:55.849 --> 03:44:55.859 align:start position:0%
they are currently in this state 29 000
 
03:44:58.490 --> 03:44:58.500 align:start position:0%
people who are immigrants who drive
 
03:44:58.500 --> 03:45:00.110 align:start position:0%
people who are immigrants who drive
legally

03:45:00.110 --> 03:45:00.120 align:start position:0%
legally
 
03:45:02.269 --> 03:45:02.279 align:start position:0%
we're just trying to make it possible
 
03:45:04.610 --> 03:45:04.620 align:start position:0%
for people whose
 
03:45:08.389 --> 03:45:08.399 align:start position:0%
the majority of whom came here like my
 
03:45:10.550 --> 03:45:10.560 align:start position:0%
great-grandfather in an effort to
 
03:45:12.950 --> 03:45:12.960 align:start position:0%
improve his life and in an effort to
 
03:45:15.950 --> 03:45:15.960 align:start position:0%
improve their families lives this is the
 
03:45:17.750 --> 03:45:17.760 align:start position:0%
right thing to do and I would urge you
 
03:45:21.889 --> 03:45:21.899 align:start position:0%
to overturn the itl motion so that
 
03:45:24.229 --> 03:45:24.239 align:start position:0%
another motion can be introduced and I
 
03:45:28.309 --> 03:45:28.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:37.010 --> 03:45:37.020 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:40.130 --> 03:45:40.140 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
03:45:44.690 --> 03:45:44.700 align:start position:0%
I stand in opposition to HB 374.
 
03:45:47.410 --> 03:45:47.420 align:start position:0%
if passed this bill will allow
 
03:45:49.670 --> 03:45:49.680 align:start position:0%
undocumented illegal individuals to
 
03:45:52.429 --> 03:45:52.439 align:start position:0%
acquire a New Hampshire driver's license
 
03:45:54.229 --> 03:45:54.239 align:start position:0%
so Mr Speaker in the spirit of Saint
 
03:45:56.269 --> 03:45:56.279 align:start position:0%
Valentine's Day
 
03:45:59.269 --> 03:45:59.279 align:start position:0%
although there's 50 Ways to Leave a
 
03:46:02.510 --> 03:46:02.520 align:start position:0%
lover according to Paul Simon
 
03:46:04.790 --> 03:46:04.800 align:start position:0%
I'm going to provide you four reasons
 
03:46:07.610 --> 03:46:07.620 align:start position:0%
why this bill should be it held
 
03:46:10.370 --> 03:46:10.380 align:start position:0%
first this bill prohibits motor vehicle
 
03:46:12.650 --> 03:46:12.660 align:start position:0%
information from being shared
 
03:46:14.990 --> 03:46:15.000 align:start position:0%
with Federal immigration enforcement
 
03:46:15.000 --> 03:46:16.429 align:start position:0%
with Federal immigration enforcement
agencies

03:46:16.429 --> 03:46:16.439 align:start position:0%
agencies
 
03:46:20.030 --> 03:46:20.040 align:start position:0%
so however if someone does disclose this
 
03:46:23.809 --> 03:46:23.819 align:start position:0%
information to federal agencies this
 
03:46:26.090 --> 03:46:26.100 align:start position:0%
person would be subject
 
03:46:28.370 --> 03:46:28.380 align:start position:0%
to punishment
 
03:46:30.469 --> 03:46:30.479 align:start position:0%
class of being misdemeanor which is
 
03:46:33.229 --> 03:46:33.239 align:start position:0%
roughly of twelve hundred dollar fine
 
03:46:35.870 --> 03:46:35.880 align:start position:0%
the person also would be civilly liable
 
03:46:39.229 --> 03:46:39.239 align:start position:0%
for actual damages of of five thousand
 
03:46:42.650 --> 03:46:42.660 align:start position:0%
dollars or more whatever is greater
 
03:46:44.750 --> 03:46:44.760 align:start position:0%
so does it make sense to you that a
 
03:46:46.670 --> 03:46:46.680 align:start position:0%
person who reports someone who may be
 
03:46:49.190 --> 03:46:49.200 align:start position:0%
here illegally in our country
 
03:46:51.469 --> 03:46:51.479 align:start position:0%
be punished
 
03:46:54.349 --> 03:46:54.359 align:start position:0%
second election integrity
 
03:46:56.570 --> 03:46:56.580 align:start position:0%
in testimonial was brought up that this
 
03:46:58.969 --> 03:46:58.979 align:start position:0%
was strictly for driving
 
03:47:01.130 --> 03:47:01.140 align:start position:0%
but there's nothing in the bill
 
03:47:04.190 --> 03:47:04.200 align:start position:0%
that stops an undocumented person to use
 
03:47:06.530 --> 03:47:06.540 align:start position:0%
it to vote
 
03:47:08.870 --> 03:47:08.880 align:start position:0%
this bill cannot provide a hundred
 
03:47:11.030 --> 03:47:11.040 align:start position:0%
percent guarantee that it will not be
 
03:47:14.690 --> 03:47:14.700 align:start position:0%
used for voting purposes
 
03:47:17.750 --> 03:47:17.760 align:start position:0%
third proponents for this bill say that
 
03:47:20.630 --> 03:47:20.640 align:start position:0%
it makes things safer
 
03:47:23.150 --> 03:47:23.160 align:start position:0%
that if they in fact
 
03:47:25.190 --> 03:47:25.200 align:start position:0%
will get a license that they'll get in
 
03:47:27.650 --> 03:47:27.660 align:start position:0%
get insurance
 
03:47:29.510 --> 03:47:29.520 align:start position:0%
well this is an interesting argument
 
03:47:31.849 --> 03:47:31.859 align:start position:0%
because car insurance is not required
 
03:47:33.229 --> 03:47:33.239 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire
 
03:47:35.389 --> 03:47:35.399 align:start position:0%
so then there's no tangible evidence to
 
03:47:38.269 --> 03:47:38.279 align:start position:0%
support this claim in testimony
 
03:47:40.190 --> 03:47:40.200 align:start position:0%
and lastly and probably the biggest
 
03:47:40.200 --> 03:47:41.690 align:start position:0%
and lastly and probably the biggest
reason

03:47:41.690 --> 03:47:41.700 align:start position:0%
reason
 
03:47:44.090 --> 03:47:44.100 align:start position:0%
this bill will make New Hampshire a
 
03:47:46.729 --> 03:47:46.739 align:start position:0%
sanctuary state
 
03:47:50.090 --> 03:47:50.100 align:start position:0%
so in closing I say this
 
03:47:53.150 --> 03:47:53.160 align:start position:0%
driving is a privilege granted to U.S
 
03:47:56.389 --> 03:47:56.399 align:start position:0%
citizens living in New Hampshire
 
03:47:59.210 --> 03:47:59.220 align:start position:0%
it is not a right
 
03:48:02.150 --> 03:48:02.160 align:start position:0%
with that I ask you to support the
 
03:48:04.490 --> 03:48:04.500 align:start position:0%
motion of itl by pressing the green
 
03:48:07.790 --> 03:48:07.800 align:start position:0%

03:48:14.269 --> 03:48:14.279 align:start position:0%
a division has been called this will be
 
03:48:45.410 --> 03:48:45.420 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:45.420 --> 03:49:18.729 align:start position:0%

03:49:20.769 --> 03:49:20.779 align:start position:0%
experiential legislator and house bill
 
03:49:23.990 --> 03:49:24.000 align:start position:0%

03:49:25.490 --> 03:49:25.500 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes representative value
 
03:49:32.150 --> 03:49:32.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:34.010 --> 03:49:34.020 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
03:49:37.490 --> 03:49:37.500 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker if I know that HP 374 would
 
03:49:37.500 --> 03:49:38.870 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker if I know that HP 374 would
allow

03:49:38.870 --> 03:49:38.880 align:start position:0%
allow
 
03:49:40.370 --> 03:49:40.380 align:start position:0%
individuals with certain religious
 
03:49:42.050 --> 03:49:42.060 align:start position:0%
objections to get a license and would
 
03:49:43.790 --> 03:49:43.800 align:start position:0%
also improve Road Safety by requiring
 
03:49:46.490 --> 03:49:46.500 align:start position:0%
undocumented immigrants an estimated 15
 
03:49:48.830 --> 03:49:48.840 align:start position:0%
000 of whom already live work and drive
 
03:49:50.389 --> 03:49:50.399 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire and otherwise meet all
 
03:49:52.010 --> 03:49:52.020 align:start position:0%
the requirements for New Hampshire
 
03:49:54.889 --> 03:49:54.899 align:start position:0%
residency to take the written licensing
 
03:49:57.410 --> 03:49:57.420 align:start position:0%
exam and practical road test to prove
 
03:49:59.870 --> 03:49:59.880 align:start position:0%
they are safe to be on our roadways and
 
03:50:02.450 --> 03:50:02.460 align:start position:0%
if I know the person's having a driver's
 
03:50:04.010 --> 03:50:04.020 align:start position:0%
license would help law enforcement but
 
03:50:05.990 --> 03:50:06.000 align:start position:0%
providing positive identification of
 
03:50:07.370 --> 03:50:07.380 align:start position:0%
individuals as well as their local
 
03:50:10.790 --> 03:50:10.800 align:start position:0%
addresses and if I know that laws just
 
03:50:12.650 --> 03:50:12.660 align:start position:0%
like this are already successfully on
 
03:50:15.290 --> 03:50:15.300 align:start position:0%
the books and working in at least 18
 
03:50:17.929 --> 03:50:17.939 align:start position:0%
states would I now press the red button
 
03:50:20.150 --> 03:50:20.160 align:start position:0%
to defeat the itl so that another motion
 
03:50:22.790 --> 03:50:22.800 align:start position:0%
may be made
 
03:50:24.050 --> 03:50:24.060 align:start position:0%
do you recognize the representative
 
03:50:31.429 --> 03:50:31.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:33.410 --> 03:50:33.420 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr speaker thank you Mr
 
03:50:33.420 --> 03:50:34.490 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr speaker thank you Mr
Speaker

03:50:34.490 --> 03:50:34.500 align:start position:0%
Speaker
 
03:50:37.250 --> 03:50:37.260 align:start position:0%
if I know that this bill would grant
 
03:50:40.190 --> 03:50:40.200 align:start position:0%
driving privileges a privilege to drive
 
03:50:42.889 --> 03:50:42.899 align:start position:0%
to people that are in our state openly
 
03:50:42.899 --> 03:50:44.330 align:start position:0%
to people that are in our state openly
illegally

03:50:44.330 --> 03:50:44.340 align:start position:0%
illegally
 
03:50:46.250 --> 03:50:46.260 align:start position:0%
if I also know Mr Speaker that many of
 
03:50:47.510 --> 03:50:47.520 align:start position:0%
these people have testified in
 
03:50:49.130 --> 03:50:49.140 align:start position:0%
transportation in the past that they're
 
03:50:51.650 --> 03:50:51.660 align:start position:0%
also driving illegally
 
03:50:53.809 --> 03:50:53.819 align:start position:0%
we need to pass the laws so that they
 
03:50:55.490 --> 03:50:55.500 align:start position:0%
can get to their jobs but however
 
03:50:57.410 --> 03:50:57.420 align:start position:0%
without a social security number they're
 
03:51:00.590 --> 03:51:00.600 align:start position:0%
probably working illegally
 
03:51:03.530 --> 03:51:03.540 align:start position:0%
finally Mr Speaker if I also know that
 
03:51:05.269 --> 03:51:05.279 align:start position:0%
this bill prohibits law enforcement from
 
03:51:06.530 --> 03:51:06.540 align:start position:0%
sharing any info with Federal
 
03:51:09.469 --> 03:51:09.479 align:start position:0%
immigration agencies would I now press
 
03:51:12.530 --> 03:51:12.540 align:start position:0%
the green button thank you
 
03:51:14.630 --> 03:51:14.640 align:start position:0%

03:52:37.490 --> 03:52:37.500 align:start position:0%
House Bill 388 FN next relative to a

number of plates for Motor Vehicles
 
03:52:40.490 --> 03:52:40.500 align:start position:0%
having considered the same report the
 
03:52:41.710 --> 03:52:41.720 align:start position:0%
same with the following resolution
 
03:52:43.670 --> 03:52:43.680 align:start position:0%
resolved that is in expedient to
 
03:52:46.070 --> 03:52:46.080 align:start position:0%
legislate Senator Daniel for the
 
03:52:49.250 --> 03:52:49.260 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:50.929 --> 03:52:50.939 align:start position:0%
minority of the committee have been
 
03:52:52.370 --> 03:52:52.380 align:start position:0%
considered the same being unable to
 
03:52:54.590 --> 03:52:54.600 align:start position:0%
agree with the majority Report with the
 
03:52:56.090 --> 03:52:56.100 align:start position:0%
recommendation that the bill ought to
 
03:52:58.190 --> 03:52:58.200 align:start position:0%
pass Senator Charlie Sinclair for the
 
03:53:04.190 --> 03:53:04.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:10.969 --> 03:53:10.979 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:14.030 --> 03:53:14.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:15.950 --> 03:53:15.960 align:start position:0%
there was two bills very similar in
 
03:53:18.050 --> 03:53:18.060 align:start position:0%
nature that were filed this year
 
03:53:20.750 --> 03:53:20.760 align:start position:0%
relative to use of rear license plates
 
03:53:20.760 --> 03:53:21.830 align:start position:0%
relative to use of rear license plates
only

03:53:21.830 --> 03:53:21.840 align:start position:0%
only
 
03:53:23.510 --> 03:53:23.520 align:start position:0%
the first bill I believe was either
 
03:53:25.429 --> 03:53:25.439 align:start position:0%
retained by the committee
 
03:53:27.950 --> 03:53:27.960 align:start position:0%
or voted itl in favor of this one
 
03:53:30.170 --> 03:53:30.180 align:start position:0%
because it went further
 
03:53:32.630 --> 03:53:32.640 align:start position:0%
that bill would have Exempted all
 
03:53:36.410 --> 03:53:36.420 align:start position:0%
vehicles other than government vehicles
 
03:53:38.389 --> 03:53:38.399 align:start position:0%
from requiring both a front and rear
 
03:53:40.250 --> 03:53:40.260 align:start position:0%
license plate
 
03:53:42.469 --> 03:53:42.479 align:start position:0%
during committee we heard from the
 
03:53:44.809 --> 03:53:44.819 align:start position:0%
Department that the system won't work
 
03:53:47.450 --> 03:53:47.460 align:start position:0%
with just rear license plates they need
 
03:53:49.670 --> 03:53:49.680 align:start position:0%
the front license plates we were told
 
03:53:52.550 --> 03:53:52.560 align:start position:0%
however there are 20 States
 
03:53:54.170 --> 03:53:54.180 align:start position:0%
including Vermont
 
03:53:55.910 --> 03:53:55.920 align:start position:0%
where rear license plates are the
 
03:53:55.920 --> 03:53:58.550 align:start position:0%
where rear license plates are the
standard

03:53:58.550 --> 03:53:58.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:00.530 --> 03:54:00.540 align:start position:0%
almost 30 years ago when I moved here I
 
03:54:02.990 --> 03:54:03.000 align:start position:0%
was told you're moving to New Hampshire
 
03:54:04.670 --> 03:54:04.680 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire has 10 months of winter
 
03:54:07.729 --> 03:54:07.739 align:start position:0%
and two months of rough sledding
 
03:54:12.410 --> 03:54:12.420 align:start position:0%
I I say that because all the plow trucks
 
03:54:15.050 --> 03:54:15.060 align:start position:0%
driving between October and April or
 
03:54:17.870 --> 03:54:17.880 align:start position:0%
March are driving around with their
 
03:54:20.570 --> 03:54:20.580 align:start position:0%
front license plate blocked
 
03:54:22.729 --> 03:54:22.739 align:start position:0%
all the cars
 
03:54:25.370 --> 03:54:25.380 align:start position:0%
that get vanity plates are handed a
 
03:54:25.380 --> 03:54:26.809 align:start position:0%
that get vanity plates are handed a
handwritten

03:54:26.809 --> 03:54:26.819 align:start position:0%
handwritten
 
03:54:29.389 --> 03:54:29.399 align:start position:0%
paper plate that sits on the back of
 
03:54:31.790 --> 03:54:31.800 align:start position:0%
their car for weeks on end
 
03:54:33.889 --> 03:54:33.899 align:start position:0%
sometimes it's a month I was actually
 
03:54:35.689 --> 03:54:35.699 align:start position:0%
told my Mac town clerk I should put it
 
03:54:37.389 --> 03:54:37.399 align:start position:0%
in a plastic bag to make sure it doesn't
 
03:54:39.290 --> 03:54:39.300 align:start position:0%
disintegrate before I got the real
 
03:54:41.269 --> 03:54:41.279 align:start position:0%
license plate
 
03:54:43.910 --> 03:54:43.920 align:start position:0%
so yet another example of a vehicle that
 
03:54:45.349 --> 03:54:45.359 align:start position:0%
doesn't have a front license plate that
 
03:54:50.750 --> 03:54:50.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:52.969 --> 03:54:52.979 align:start position:0%
some said it was about the money not
 
03:54:55.010 --> 03:54:55.020 align:start position:0%
allowed to use props but someone said it
 
03:54:56.929 --> 03:54:56.939 align:start position:0%
was about the money but there are only
 
03:54:58.670 --> 03:54:58.680 align:start position:0%
five tolls
 
03:55:01.670 --> 03:55:01.680 align:start position:0%
told booths those that are manned that
 
03:55:04.309 --> 03:55:04.319 align:start position:0%
don't have rear-facing cameras already
 
03:55:06.889 --> 03:55:06.899 align:start position:0%
in existence
 
03:55:09.110 --> 03:55:09.120 align:start position:0%
this is an important Liberty aspect and
 
03:55:11.150 --> 03:55:11.160 align:start position:0%
I would ask that you would support
 
03:55:11.160 --> 03:55:11.929 align:start position:0%
I would ask that you would support
um

03:55:11.929 --> 03:55:11.939 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:55:14.929 --> 03:55:14.939 align:start position:0%
the motion to overturn the itl so that
 
03:55:18.290 --> 03:55:18.300 align:start position:0%
we can bring up an auto pass motion
 
03:55:19.969 --> 03:55:19.979 align:start position:0%
um we have a system that has to work
 
03:55:22.150 --> 03:55:22.160 align:start position:0%
with single rear license plates anyway
 
03:55:24.530 --> 03:55:24.540 align:start position:0%
why do we insist that we continue to
 
03:55:26.210 --> 03:55:26.220 align:start position:0%
have front license plates on our cars
 
03:55:28.610 --> 03:55:28.620 align:start position:0%
when numerous new cars don't even have
 
03:55:31.490 --> 03:55:31.500 align:start position:0%
brackets to put them on thank you just
 
03:55:34.189 --> 03:55:34.199 align:start position:0%
remember yield the questions
 
03:55:34.199 --> 03:55:35.330 align:start position:0%
remember yield the questions
sure

03:55:35.330 --> 03:55:35.340 align:start position:0%
sure
 
03:55:40.070 --> 03:55:40.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:42.349 --> 03:55:42.359 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker would you believe
 
03:55:44.630 --> 03:55:44.640 align:start position:0%
that this bill has the potential to
 
03:55:46.849 --> 03:55:46.859 align:start position:0%
actually raise revenue for this date by
 
03:55:49.670 --> 03:55:49.680 align:start position:0%
allowing people who only have one plate
 
03:55:52.309 --> 03:55:52.319 align:start position:0%
the same pay the same cost for two if a
 
03:55:57.530 --> 03:55:57.540 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:00.830 --> 03:56:00.840 align:start position:0%
yes I believe that it is possible with
 
03:56:03.349 --> 03:56:03.359 align:start position:0%
the current structure for the the fiscal
 
03:56:06.349 --> 03:56:06.359 align:start position:0%
note to raise revenue I also believe
 
03:56:09.170 --> 03:56:09.180 align:start position:0%
that if we focused on trying to track
 
03:56:11.450 --> 03:56:11.460 align:start position:0%
only the rear license plates we would
 
03:56:13.309 --> 03:56:13.319 align:start position:0%
pick up additional revenue from the
 
03:56:15.050 --> 03:56:15.060 align:start position:0%
other states that only have rear license
 
03:56:17.150 --> 03:56:17.160 align:start position:0%
plates thank you
 
03:56:18.710 --> 03:56:18.720 align:start position:0%
do you recognize your representative
 
03:56:18.720 --> 03:56:28.550 align:start position:0%
do you recognize your representative

03:56:28.550 --> 03:56:28.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:31.250 --> 03:56:31.260 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker colleagues
 
03:56:34.670 --> 03:56:34.680 align:start position:0%
I I only have about two things to say
 
03:56:37.250 --> 03:56:37.260 align:start position:0%
about this bill the first is that there
 
03:56:37.260 --> 03:56:38.389 align:start position:0%
about this bill the first is that there
was

03:56:38.389 --> 03:56:38.399 align:start position:0%
was
 
03:56:41.210 --> 03:56:41.220 align:start position:0%
strong support on the part of the public
 
03:56:44.689 --> 03:56:44.699 align:start position:0%
safety agencies to require the second
 
03:56:47.750 --> 03:56:47.760 align:start position:0%
plate because a lot of crime happens
 
03:56:50.809 --> 03:56:50.819 align:start position:0%
with Motor Vehicles being used in this
 
03:56:53.650 --> 03:56:53.660 align:start position:0%
state and it helps identify the vehicle
 
03:56:57.050 --> 03:56:57.060 align:start position:0%
and the perhaps identify the perpetrator
 
03:57:00.590 --> 03:57:00.600 align:start position:0%
so that's part one part two
 
03:57:03.950 --> 03:57:03.960 align:start position:0%
in an unusual thing for me
 
03:57:07.729 --> 03:57:07.739 align:start position:0%
this was a true bipartisan vote on the
 
03:57:09.349 --> 03:57:09.359 align:start position:0%
part of the committee
 
03:57:12.410 --> 03:57:12.420 align:start position:0%
a few Democrats didn't vote with the
 
03:57:12.420 --> 03:57:13.309 align:start position:0%
a few Democrats didn't vote with the
committee

03:57:13.309 --> 03:57:13.319 align:start position:0%
committee
 
03:57:16.070 --> 03:57:16.080 align:start position:0%
and a few Republicans didn't vote with
 
03:57:18.830 --> 03:57:18.840 align:start position:0%
the committee but the switch led to the
 
03:57:20.870 --> 03:57:20.880 align:start position:0%
result that you see which was eleven
 
03:57:24.530 --> 03:57:24.540 align:start position:0%
nine so that is this I want you to
 
03:57:27.590 --> 03:57:27.600 align:start position:0%
remember that wasn't it nice for once
 
03:57:31.910 --> 03:57:31.920 align:start position:0%
where Democrats and Republicans sitting
 
03:57:33.889 --> 03:57:33.899 align:start position:0%
in Committee hearing all of the
 
03:57:36.889 --> 03:57:36.899 align:start position:0%
testimony not just parts of it
 
03:57:39.950 --> 03:57:39.960 align:start position:0%
agreed that this was the proper thing to
 
03:57:42.469 --> 03:57:42.479 align:start position:0%
do would be to itl this bill and I would
 
03:57:45.170 --> 03:57:45.180 align:start position:0%
urge you to vote so
 
03:57:48.349 --> 03:57:48.359 align:start position:0%
again I would ask for a division vote
 
03:57:51.349 --> 03:57:51.359 align:start position:0%
we're under the senator was asked for a
 
03:57:52.790 --> 03:57:52.800 align:start position:0%
roll call vote is that sufficiently
 
03:57:52.800 --> 03:57:56.510 align:start position:0%
roll call vote is that sufficiently
second

03:57:56.510 --> 03:57:56.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:58.729 --> 03:57:58.739 align:start position:0%
it is sufficiently seconded this will be
 
03:59:22.250 --> 03:59:22.260 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:22.260 --> 03:59:59.469 align:start position:0%
 
positions

03:59:59.469 --> 03:59:59.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:02.090 --> 04:00:02.100 align:start position:0%
the motion before us is the majority
 
04:00:03.710 --> 04:00:03.720 align:start position:0%
committee report of any expedient to
 
04:00:06.410 --> 04:00:06.420 align:start position:0%
legislate on House Bill 388 this will be
 
04:00:08.389 --> 04:00:08.399 align:start position:0%
a roll call vote chair recognizes
 
04:00:09.769 --> 04:00:09.779 align:start position:0%
representative Sinclair for a
 
04:00:17.030 --> 04:00:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:18.889 --> 04:00:18.899 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
04:00:20.630 --> 04:00:20.640 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker
 
04:00:23.150 --> 04:00:23.160 align:start position:0%
if I know that the Department of Motor
 
04:00:27.590 --> 04:00:27.600 align:start position:0%
Vehicles only has five
 
04:00:29.510 --> 04:00:29.520 align:start position:0%
toll Lanes
 
04:00:33.110 --> 04:00:33.120 align:start position:0%
which have attendance attendance
 
04:00:37.010 --> 04:00:37.020 align:start position:0%
from 6 a.m to 10 P.M
 
04:00:39.349 --> 04:00:39.359 align:start position:0%
without a rear camera
 
04:00:41.750 --> 04:00:41.760 align:start position:0%
and if I also know that the Department
 
04:00:44.510 --> 04:00:44.520 align:start position:0%
of Motor Vehicles issues only one paper
 
04:00:47.210 --> 04:00:47.220 align:start position:0%
plate for vanity plates which are good
 
04:00:49.490 --> 04:00:49.500 align:start position:0%
for up to a year and in some cases 16
 
04:00:53.210 --> 04:00:53.220 align:start position:0%
months one plate
 
04:00:55.189 --> 04:00:55.199 align:start position:0%
and if I know that the Department of
 
04:00:58.790 --> 04:00:58.800 align:start position:0%
Motor Vehicles only issue allows dealer
 
04:01:01.250 --> 04:01:01.260 align:start position:0%
plates to be used only on the back of a
 
04:01:04.729 --> 04:01:04.739 align:start position:0%
vehicle by by while being driven around
 
04:01:06.170 --> 04:01:06.180 align:start position:0%
state roads
 
04:01:08.210 --> 04:01:08.220 align:start position:0%
in the Department of Motor Vehicles
 
04:01:11.450 --> 04:01:11.460 align:start position:0%
allows commemorative plates to cover the
 
04:01:15.050 --> 04:01:15.060 align:start position:0%
front of a license of the vehicle up to
 
04:01:18.769 --> 04:01:18.779 align:start position:0%
a year for anniversaries and
 
04:01:22.969 --> 04:01:22.979 align:start position:0%
special occasions for towns and cities
 
04:01:26.570 --> 04:01:26.580 align:start position:0%
and as if I also know that
 
04:01:30.070 --> 04:01:30.080 align:start position:0%
the Department of Motor Vehicles allows
 
04:01:33.830 --> 04:01:33.840 align:start position:0%
trucks and sometimes Vans to go around
 
04:01:35.870 --> 04:01:35.880 align:start position:0%
with plows covering the front of their
 
04:01:38.510 --> 04:01:38.520 align:start position:0%
license plate for several months of the
 
04:01:41.510 --> 04:01:41.520 align:start position:0%
year if I also know that 21 states 21
 
04:01:44.929 --> 04:01:44.939 align:start position:0%
States now allow for only the rear plate
 
04:01:46.370 --> 04:01:46.380 align:start position:0%
to be used
 
04:01:47.689 --> 04:01:47.699 align:start position:0%
and that
 
04:01:51.410 --> 04:01:51.420 align:start position:0%
I also know that motor vehicles new ones
 
04:01:54.410 --> 04:01:54.420 align:start position:0%
coming out now quite often do not have a
 
04:01:56.870 --> 04:01:56.880 align:start position:0%
front bracket for a license plate which
 
04:01:59.330 --> 04:01:59.340 align:start position:0%
causes an added representative this is
 
04:02:01.729 --> 04:02:01.739 align:start position:0%
that's an entry inquiry all right sorry
 
04:02:06.349 --> 04:02:06.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:09.170 --> 04:02:09.180 align:start position:0%
would I now ask you to encourage you to
 
04:02:11.990 --> 04:02:12.000 align:start position:0%
press the red button so a better bill
 
04:02:16.010 --> 04:02:16.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:17.870 --> 04:02:17.880 align:start position:0%
chair recognize the representative Sykes
 
04:02:24.170 --> 04:02:24.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:29.090 --> 04:02:29.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:31.370 --> 04:02:31.380 align:start position:0%
speaker if I know that according to
 
04:02:33.469 --> 04:02:33.479 align:start position:0%
testimony from the New Hampshire
 
04:02:35.210 --> 04:02:35.220 align:start position:0%
Department of Transportation
 
04:02:37.969 --> 04:02:37.979 align:start position:0%
specifically the Bureau of turnpikes
 
04:02:40.870 --> 04:02:40.880 align:start position:0%
that 53 percent of their toll revenues
 
04:02:43.550 --> 04:02:43.560 align:start position:0%
that information is captured by the
 
04:02:45.590 --> 04:02:45.600 align:start position:0%
front license plate
 
04:02:50.870 --> 04:02:50.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:53.450 --> 04:02:53.460 align:start position:0%
of this more than half of the states
 
04:02:55.910 --> 04:02:55.920 align:start position:0%
that have single plate requirements are
 
04:02:57.170 --> 04:02:57.180 align:start position:0%
actually in
 
04:02:59.570 --> 04:02:59.580 align:start position:0%
a Southern Climate where the weather is
 
04:03:01.969 --> 04:03:01.979 align:start position:0%
not such a big factor
 
04:03:04.189 --> 04:03:04.199 align:start position:0%
and if I finally know
 
04:03:04.199 --> 04:03:05.510 align:start position:0%
and if I finally know
that

04:03:05.510 --> 04:03:05.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:03:08.630 --> 04:03:08.640 align:start position:0%
one of the states that was single plate
 
04:03:11.870 --> 04:03:11.880 align:start position:0%
in the past Pennsylvania is currently
 
04:03:14.269 --> 04:03:14.279 align:start position:0%
engaged in a process to overturn that
 
04:03:16.490 --> 04:03:16.500 align:start position:0%
law and put back the second plate
 
04:03:18.110 --> 04:03:18.120 align:start position:0%
because of the problems that they have
 
04:03:18.120 --> 04:03:19.210 align:start position:0%
because of the problems that they have
encountered

04:03:19.210 --> 04:03:19.220 align:start position:0%
encountered
 
04:03:23.929 --> 04:03:23.939 align:start position:0%
with that I would urge the
 
04:03:28.550 --> 04:03:28.560 align:start position:0%
what I now urge the body to follow the
 
04:03:31.790 --> 04:03:31.800 align:start position:0%
strong bipartisan vote and vote green on
 
04:03:33.769 --> 04:03:33.779 align:start position:0%

04:05:31.610 --> 04:05:31.620 align:start position:0%
to which was referred House Bill 597 FN
 
04:05:34.849 --> 04:05:34.859 align:start position:0%
relative to race ethnicity data on

04:05:39.170 --> 04:05:39.180 align:start position:0%
authenticity data collection this comes
 
04:05:41.630 --> 04:05:41.640 align:start position:0%
without recommendation chair recognizes
 
04:05:46.910 --> 04:05:46.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:53.750 --> 04:05:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:55.670 --> 04:05:55.680 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
04:05:59.030 --> 04:05:59.040 align:start position:0%
so the bill authorizes people to
 
04:06:02.809 --> 04:06:02.819 align:start position:0%
voluntarily put race and ethnicity on
 
04:06:05.389 --> 04:06:05.399 align:start position:0%
their licenses and requires law
 
04:06:07.849 --> 04:06:07.859 align:start position:0%
enforcement to collect that information
 
04:06:10.189 --> 04:06:10.199 align:start position:0%
then it does a few other things they may
 
04:06:12.670 --> 04:06:12.680 align:start position:0%
or may not make that information public
 
04:06:14.870 --> 04:06:14.880 align:start position:0%
and beyond that it doesn't really say
 
04:06:17.229 --> 04:06:17.239 align:start position:0%
what they're going to do with it so
 
04:06:20.030 --> 04:06:20.040 align:start position:0%
I get the idea of collecting data but
 
04:06:22.250 --> 04:06:22.260 align:start position:0%
this isn't data it's numbers and here's
 
04:06:22.260 --> 04:06:23.090 align:start position:0%
this isn't data it's numbers and here's
why

04:06:23.090 --> 04:06:23.100 align:start position:0%
why
 
04:06:26.210 --> 04:06:26.220 align:start position:0%
when you have a giant pool of potential
 
04:06:28.670 --> 04:06:28.680 align:start position:0%
inputs to a data set you can have some
 
04:06:30.349 --> 04:06:30.359 align:start position:0%
errors some anomalies and they're
 
04:06:31.910 --> 04:06:31.920 align:start position:0%
statistically insignificant and that's
 
04:06:31.920 --> 04:06:32.990 align:start position:0%
statistically insignificant and that's
fine

04:06:32.990 --> 04:06:33.000 align:start position:0%
fine
 
04:06:34.969 --> 04:06:34.979 align:start position:0%
we don't have a lot of people in New
 
04:06:37.790 --> 04:06:37.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and the percentage of people
 
04:06:40.849 --> 04:06:40.859 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire that are non-caucasian
 
04:06:43.070 --> 04:06:43.080 align:start position:0%
ethnicities is really small so any
 
04:06:44.929 --> 04:06:44.939 align:start position:0%
anomaly in those numbers will be
 
04:06:46.849 --> 04:06:46.859 align:start position:0%
statistically significant lead to
 
04:06:48.349 --> 04:06:48.359 align:start position:0%
incorrect conclusions so here's an
 
04:06:48.359 --> 04:06:49.429 align:start position:0%
incorrect conclusions so here's an
example

04:06:49.429 --> 04:06:49.439 align:start position:0%
example
 
04:06:53.630 --> 04:06:53.640 align:start position:0%
let's say for the sake of argument that
 
04:06:55.849 --> 04:06:55.859 align:start position:0%
people who are going to check Asian or
 
04:06:58.189 --> 04:06:58.199 align:start position:0%
whatever they get on there are 50
 
04:07:00.830 --> 04:07:00.840 align:start position:0%
percent less likely to self-report than
 
04:07:02.450 --> 04:07:02.460 align:start position:0%
African Americans
 
04:07:03.830 --> 04:07:03.840 align:start position:0%
what are the numbers that you're going
 
04:07:05.210 --> 04:07:05.220 align:start position:0%
to get
 
04:07:07.610 --> 04:07:07.620 align:start position:0%
what are they going to prove
 
04:07:10.130 --> 04:07:10.140 align:start position:0%
the unchecked boxes well are we going to
 
04:07:11.570 --> 04:07:11.580 align:start position:0%
assume that they're Caucasian when
 
04:07:13.969 --> 04:07:13.979 align:start position:0%
they're actually not and then what if
 
04:07:17.990 --> 04:07:18.000 align:start position:0%
there were say a thousand of each in a
 
04:07:20.150 --> 04:07:20.160 align:start position:0%
given municipality and with the
 
04:07:22.429 --> 04:07:22.439 align:start position:0%
underreporting of one it'll look like
 
04:07:24.889 --> 04:07:24.899 align:start position:0%
the numbers from the other people have
 
04:07:27.469 --> 04:07:27.479 align:start position:0%
in contact with law enforcement are much
 
04:07:29.870 --> 04:07:29.880 align:start position:0%
higher but it might not be the case so
 
04:07:34.189 --> 04:07:34.199 align:start position:0%
what have you proven nothing it's junk
 
04:07:35.809 --> 04:07:35.819 align:start position:0%
what will we do with the numbers
 
04:07:38.450 --> 04:07:38.460 align:start position:0%
presumably there's a reason to have
 
04:07:41.150 --> 04:07:41.160 align:start position:0%
these numbers the bill is silent
 
04:07:43.130 --> 04:07:43.140 align:start position:0%
on what we're going to do with it there
 
04:07:44.330 --> 04:07:44.340 align:start position:0%
are no guard rails there are no
 
04:07:45.769 --> 04:07:45.779 align:start position:0%
prohibitions you could use them for
 
04:07:45.779 --> 04:07:46.490 align:start position:0%
prohibitions you could use them for
anything

04:07:46.490 --> 04:07:46.500 align:start position:0%
anything
 
04:07:48.830 --> 04:07:48.840 align:start position:0%
so what if in the example that I cited
 
04:07:51.290 --> 04:07:51.300 align:start position:0%
the police that are collecting and
 
04:07:53.870 --> 04:07:53.880 align:start position:0%
required to keep this information just
 
04:07:55.910 --> 04:07:55.920 align:start position:0%
look at totals not percentages because
 
04:07:59.090 --> 04:07:59.100 align:start position:0%
they can't get them and go wow when we
 
04:08:02.050 --> 04:08:02.060 align:start position:0%
have interaction with I don't know
 
04:08:04.630 --> 04:08:04.640 align:start position:0%
indigenous people
 
04:08:07.610 --> 04:08:07.620 align:start position:0%
there are 30 percent more likely to be
 
04:08:09.849 --> 04:08:09.859 align:start position:0%
armed than if we are pulling over
 
04:08:11.570 --> 04:08:11.580 align:start position:0%
African-American people
 
04:08:14.389 --> 04:08:14.399 align:start position:0%
might they adjust how they interact then
 
04:08:16.610 --> 04:08:16.620 align:start position:0%
and that would be a tragedy because you
 
04:08:19.189 --> 04:08:19.199 align:start position:0%
have no idea if those numbers are
 
04:08:22.130 --> 04:08:22.140 align:start position:0%
accurate so even if you like the idea of
 
04:08:24.050 --> 04:08:24.060 align:start position:0%
collecting this information and doing
 
04:08:26.210 --> 04:08:26.220 align:start position:0%
some greater good with it you still
 
04:08:28.429 --> 04:08:28.439 align:start position:0%
can't vote for the bill because it's a
 
04:08:30.530 --> 04:08:30.540 align:start position:0%
half a plan it doesn't say what you're
 
04:08:32.090 --> 04:08:32.100 align:start position:0%
going to do with the data it doesn't
 
04:08:34.610 --> 04:08:34.620 align:start position:0%
validate the data and it doesn't protect
 
04:08:36.170 --> 04:08:36.180 align:start position:0%
the people you're collecting the data
 
04:08:36.180 --> 04:08:37.490 align:start position:0%
the people you're collecting the data
from

04:08:37.490 --> 04:08:37.500 align:start position:0%
from
 
04:08:39.530 --> 04:08:39.540 align:start position:0%
if you wanted to do this you would have
 
04:08:41.990 --> 04:08:42.000 align:start position:0%
to put guidelines in place or an
 
04:08:43.969 --> 04:08:43.979 align:start position:0%
oversight committee to determine what
 
04:08:45.410 --> 04:08:45.420 align:start position:0%
law enforcement can do with these when
 
04:08:48.170 --> 04:08:48.180 align:start position:0%
they collect them you don't know
 
04:08:50.450 --> 04:08:50.460 align:start position:0%
and I'll just leave you with when you
 
04:08:51.769 --> 04:08:51.779 align:start position:0%
don't know
 
04:08:54.110 --> 04:08:54.120 align:start position:0%
then you can't support the bill please
 
04:08:57.769 --> 04:08:57.779 align:start position:0%
votes overturn the OTP
 
04:08:59.150 --> 04:08:59.160 align:start position:0%
chair recognize your representative
 
04:08:59.160 --> 04:09:06.170 align:start position:0%
chair recognize your representative
Sykes

04:09:06.170 --> 04:09:06.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:10.849 --> 04:09:10.859 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:13.969 --> 04:09:13.979 align:start position:0%
so House Bill 597 this is a bill which
 
04:09:17.170 --> 04:09:17.180 align:start position:0%
will allow people to opt in to providing
 
04:09:20.090 --> 04:09:20.100 align:start position:0%
ethnicity and race information on their
 
04:09:24.170 --> 04:09:24.180 align:start position:0%
driver's licenses and the DMV testified
 
04:09:27.349 --> 04:09:27.359 align:start position:0%
that their plan would be to
 
04:09:30.110 --> 04:09:30.120 align:start position:0%
put a box on the driver's license with a
 
04:09:32.030 --> 04:09:32.040 align:start position:0%
letter or number code that would
 
04:09:33.830 --> 04:09:33.840 align:start position:0%
indicate certain things but it would not
 
04:09:36.290 --> 04:09:36.300 align:start position:0%
necess it would not clearly say this
 
04:09:39.050 --> 04:09:39.060 align:start position:0%
person has of this ethnicity or this
 
04:09:41.570 --> 04:09:41.580 align:start position:0%
person is of that ethnicity
 
04:09:44.269 --> 04:09:44.279 align:start position:0%
the issue is
 
04:09:48.710 --> 04:09:48.720 align:start position:0%
there is no Statewide data now
 
04:09:50.570 --> 04:09:50.580 align:start position:0%
one of the things that I learned in
 
04:09:52.670 --> 04:09:52.680 align:start position:0%
looking into this bill because my first
 
04:09:54.950 --> 04:09:54.960 align:start position:0%
reaction when I saw this bill my first
 
04:09:57.229 --> 04:09:57.239 align:start position:0%
reaction was oh my gosh we don't want to
 
04:09:58.250 --> 04:09:58.260 align:start position:0%
do that
 
04:10:01.010 --> 04:10:01.020 align:start position:0%
it sounded like such a terrible idea but
 
04:10:03.110 --> 04:10:03.120 align:start position:0%
as it became evident of what the goals
 
04:10:05.809 --> 04:10:05.819 align:start position:0%
are of the pill it became equally
 
04:10:09.170 --> 04:10:09.180 align:start position:0%
important and it became equally evident
 
04:10:11.030 --> 04:10:11.040 align:start position:0%
to me that this was an important thing
 
04:10:15.229 --> 04:10:15.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:17.030 --> 04:10:17.040 align:start position:0%
the data would be collected for the
 
04:10:19.370 --> 04:10:19.380 align:start position:0%
first time on a Statewide basis now we
 
04:10:21.769 --> 04:10:21.779 align:start position:0%
do have some police departments who are
 
04:10:23.450 --> 04:10:23.460 align:start position:0%
Kalia certified
 
04:10:25.429 --> 04:10:25.439 align:start position:0%
there's not a bunch of them that's a
 
04:10:27.170 --> 04:10:27.180 align:start position:0%
national certification program for
 
04:10:29.630 --> 04:10:29.640 align:start position:0%
police departments and it so happens
 
04:10:32.150 --> 04:10:32.160 align:start position:0%
that my community of Lebanon is one of
 
04:10:33.590 --> 04:10:33.600 align:start position:0%
those departments
 
04:10:35.870 --> 04:10:35.880 align:start position:0%
and I've learned that
 
04:10:38.450 --> 04:10:38.460 align:start position:0%
although they collect some of this data
 
04:10:41.269 --> 04:10:41.279 align:start position:0%
now it is insufficient for the purposes
 
04:10:42.650 --> 04:10:42.660 align:start position:0%
for which they would like it to be
 
04:10:46.550 --> 04:10:46.560 align:start position:0%
applied which is to learn
 
04:10:46.560 --> 04:10:49.490 align:start position:0%
applied which is to learn
whether

04:10:49.490 --> 04:10:49.500 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:51.469 --> 04:10:51.479 align:start position:0%
there's a problem or there is not a
 
04:10:55.370 --> 04:10:55.380 align:start position:0%
problem in terms of stopping folks
 
04:10:55.380 --> 04:10:56.870 align:start position:0%
problem in terms of stopping folks
so

04:10:56.870 --> 04:10:56.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:10:59.809 --> 04:10:59.819 align:start position:0%
here's another interesting point you
 
04:11:04.550 --> 04:11:04.560 align:start position:0%
won't hear this from us often either
 
04:11:08.090 --> 04:11:08.100 align:start position:0%
this bill was supported by a wide range
 
04:11:09.950 --> 04:11:09.960 align:start position:0%
of organizations
 
04:11:11.750 --> 04:11:11.760 align:start position:0%
and it tells you something about how
 
04:11:13.849 --> 04:11:13.859 align:start position:0%
important they think it is it was
 
04:11:15.349 --> 04:11:15.359 align:start position:0%
supported by the New Hampshire State
 
04:11:15.359 --> 04:11:17.510 align:start position:0%
supported by the New Hampshire State
Police

04:11:17.510 --> 04:11:17.520 align:start position:0%
Police
 
04:11:20.090 --> 04:11:20.100 align:start position:0%
it was supported by the ACLU you don't
 
04:11:21.530 --> 04:11:21.540 align:start position:0%
usually hear those two names together
 
04:11:21.540 --> 04:11:23.090 align:start position:0%
usually hear those two names together
often

04:11:23.090 --> 04:11:23.100 align:start position:0%
often
 
04:11:24.710 --> 04:11:24.720 align:start position:0%
it was supported by the New Hampshire
 
04:11:27.590 --> 04:11:27.600 align:start position:0%
Chiefs of Police Association
 
04:11:32.090 --> 04:11:32.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:33.830 --> 04:11:33.840 align:start position:0%
and the New Hampshire Department of
 
04:11:36.170 --> 04:11:36.180 align:start position:0%
Justice also came in and testified in
 
04:11:38.090 --> 04:11:38.100 align:start position:0%
support of this bill these organizations
 
04:11:41.269 --> 04:11:41.279 align:start position:0%
say this is important work that needs to
 
04:11:42.610 --> 04:11:42.620 align:start position:0%
be done
 
04:11:45.530 --> 04:11:45.540 align:start position:0%
in respect to the question about data
 
04:11:48.110 --> 04:11:48.120 align:start position:0%
being good bad or indifferent data is
 
04:11:50.269 --> 04:11:50.279 align:start position:0%
just data it's what you do with it that
 
04:11:53.210 --> 04:11:53.220 align:start position:0%
matters I agree with my colleague from
 
04:11:53.220 --> 04:11:55.610 align:start position:0%
matters I agree with my colleague from

Charlestown
 
04:11:59.030 --> 04:11:59.040 align:start position:0%
the intent for this is to look for
 
04:12:01.849 --> 04:12:01.859 align:start position:0%
Trends are there Trends in different
 
04:12:04.550 --> 04:12:04.560 align:start position:0%
communities that help
 
04:12:07.849 --> 04:12:07.859 align:start position:0%
police departments and the state police
 
04:12:09.950 --> 04:12:09.960 align:start position:0%
further Define the work that they're
 
04:12:11.570 --> 04:12:11.580 align:start position:0%
doing to be
 
04:12:14.870 --> 04:12:14.880 align:start position:0%
effective and important
 
04:12:17.090 --> 04:12:17.100 align:start position:0%
accordingly I would urge you to overturn

I'm going to try to make this very quick

if I know that incomplete data is bad
 
04:14:22.670 --> 04:14:22.680 align:start position:0%
data and I also know if you use bad data
 
04:14:25.130 --> 04:14:25.140 align:start position:0%
you make bad decisions but I now then

the marriage age in New Hampshire is 18.

and judicial approval the loophole

became law in 2018 as a step in the

04:22:34.429 --> 04:22:34.439 align:start position:0%
can also they also have to have a high
 
04:22:37.610 --> 04:22:37.620 align:start position:0%
school diploma or have their GED
 
04:22:39.530 --> 04:22:39.540 align:start position:0%
and in New Hampshire you have to be 18
 
04:22:41.330 --> 04:22:41.340 align:start position:0%
to get your GED
 
04:22:45.010 --> 04:22:45.020 align:start position:0%
if a child wants to earn their GED
 
04:22:47.990 --> 04:22:48.000 align:start position:0%
earlier the child must have their
 
04:22:49.969 --> 04:22:49.979 align:start position:0%
parents permission the superintendent of
 
04:22:52.130 --> 04:22:52.140 align:start position:0%
their school district's permission and
 
04:22:54.050 --> 04:22:54.060 align:start position:0%
pass the practice
 
04:22:56.750 --> 04:22:56.760 align:start position:0%
high five subject High test before even
 
04:22:59.809 --> 04:22:59.819 align:start position:0%
being eligible to take the high test
 
04:23:02.330 --> 04:23:02.340 align:start position:0%
so a 17 year old cannot just enlist and
 
04:23:04.910 --> 04:23:04.920 align:start position:0%
be on their way to basic Duty
 
04:23:07.010 --> 04:23:07.020 align:start position:0%
what they are doing is entering the
 
04:23:09.889 --> 04:23:09.899 align:start position:0%
Delayed Enlistment program which allows
 
04:23:11.570 --> 04:23:11.580 align:start position:0%
them to delay
 
04:23:15.349 --> 04:23:15.359 align:start position:0%
enlistment for up to 365 days and even
 
04:23:17.630 --> 04:23:17.640 align:start position:0%
then they can choose to withdraw from
 
04:23:19.969 --> 04:23:19.979 align:start position:0%
the program if they change their mind or
 
04:23:22.729 --> 04:23:22.739 align:start position:0%
if they are not ready or if they want to
 
04:23:24.769 --> 04:23:24.779 align:start position:0%
go to college instead
 
04:23:26.809 --> 04:23:26.819 align:start position:0%
child marriage has no redeeming
 
04:23:28.670 --> 04:23:28.680 align:start position:0%
qualities period
 
04:23:31.370 --> 04:23:31.380 align:start position:0%
it offers no benefits to children that
 
04:23:33.429 --> 04:23:33.439 align:start position:0%
cannot and should not be found elsewhere
 
04:23:36.830 --> 04:23:36.840 align:start position:0%
and it brings countless serious harms
 
04:23:39.769 --> 04:23:39.779 align:start position:0%
and risk we do not allow exceptions to
 
04:23:43.550 --> 04:23:43.560 align:start position:0%
drinking smoking or driving ages we set
 
04:23:45.590 --> 04:23:45.600 align:start position:0%
those ages based on when people can
 
04:23:48.349 --> 04:23:48.359 align:start position:0%
safely engage in those activities we
 
04:23:50.570 --> 04:23:50.580 align:start position:0%
should not do the same with marriage
 
04:23:53.330 --> 04:23:53.340 align:start position:0%
which the question we should be asking
 
04:23:55.309 --> 04:23:55.319 align:start position:0%
is not why we want to end child marriage
 
04:23:58.670 --> 04:23:58.680 align:start position:0%
but instead why are those why are there
 
04:24:00.590 --> 04:24:00.600 align:start position:0%
others advocating to allow adults to
 
04:24:01.910 --> 04:24:01.920 align:start position:0%
marry children
 
04:24:04.370 --> 04:24:04.380 align:start position:0%
how much longer will we wait before it
 
04:24:06.830 --> 04:24:06.840 align:start position:0%
is time to stop this practice how many
 
04:24:09.530 --> 04:24:09.540 align:start position:0%
more victims will there be how many more
 
04:24:12.590 --> 04:24:12.600 align:start position:0%
lives will be destroyed the time to end
 
04:24:14.689 --> 04:24:14.699 align:start position:0%
child marriage is not in the future the
 
04:24:17.050 --> 04:24:17.060 align:start position:0%
time is now thank you
 
04:24:20.809 --> 04:24:20.819 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:23.570 --> 04:24:23.580 align:start position:0%
there's a member yield to questions
 
04:24:25.269 --> 04:24:25.279 align:start position:0%
there's a member yield the questions
 
04:24:28.429 --> 04:24:28.439 align:start position:0%
member does not yield
 
04:24:35.450 --> 04:24:35.460 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:38.150 --> 04:24:38.160 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker and good afternoon
 
04:24:40.429 --> 04:24:40.439 align:start position:0%
to my friends here in the house
 
04:24:42.710 --> 04:24:42.720 align:start position:0%
I Rise to speak in favor of the
 
04:24:44.450 --> 04:24:44.460 align:start position:0%
committee recommendation of an
 
04:24:46.729 --> 04:24:46.739 align:start position:0%
inexpedient to legislate regarding house
 
04:24:50.389 --> 04:24:50.399 align:start position:0%
bill 34. to make absolutely sure I was
 
04:24:52.309 --> 04:24:52.319 align:start position:0%
providing credible information to you
 
04:24:55.729 --> 04:24:55.739 align:start position:0%
today yesterday I directly contacted the
 
04:24:57.769 --> 04:24:57.779 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Vital Records Office and
 
04:25:00.349 --> 04:25:00.359 align:start position:0%
asked them to provide me with a number
 
04:25:02.030 --> 04:25:02.040 align:start position:0%
of marriages recorded in New Hampshire
 
04:25:04.370 --> 04:25:04.380 align:start position:0%
where at least one party of the marriage
 
04:25:06.590 --> 04:25:06.600 align:start position:0%
was under 18 years of age from the years
 
04:25:09.110 --> 04:25:09.120 align:start position:0%
2019 to 2022
 
04:25:14.570 --> 04:25:14.580 align:start position:0%
there were five in 2019 zero in 2020
 
04:25:19.490 --> 04:25:19.500 align:start position:0%
one in 2021 and 0 in 2022.
 
04:25:21.590 --> 04:25:21.600 align:start position:0%
the reason it's important that I queried
 
04:25:24.469 --> 04:25:24.479 align:start position:0%
that data set is that in 2018 some
 
04:25:26.689 --> 04:25:26.699 align:start position:0%
important pieces of legislation were
 
04:25:28.490 --> 04:25:28.500 align:start position:0%
passed in this house was strong
 
04:25:30.969 --> 04:25:30.979 align:start position:0%
bipartisan support and signed into law
 
04:25:33.650 --> 04:25:33.660 align:start position:0%
specifically relating to minors Desiring
 
04:25:36.950 --> 04:25:36.960 align:start position:0%
to marry these laws do not make it easy
 
04:25:39.110 --> 04:25:39.120 align:start position:0%
to obtain a marriage license if one or
 
04:25:42.830 --> 04:25:42.840 align:start position:0%
both individuals is 16 or 17 years of
 
04:25:45.769 --> 04:25:45.779 align:start position:0%
age additionally if in the rare occasion
 
04:25:48.070 --> 04:25:48.080 align:start position:0%
that permission to marry is granted
 
04:25:50.450 --> 04:25:50.460 align:start position:0%
legislation has been put into place to
 
04:25:52.070 --> 04:25:52.080 align:start position:0%
make sure that these individuals have
 
04:25:54.710 --> 04:25:54.720 align:start position:0%
protections under the law
 
04:25:57.170 --> 04:25:57.180 align:start position:0%
presently some of what is required by
 
04:25:59.510 --> 04:25:59.520 align:start position:0%
law in order for underage marriage to
 
04:26:02.030 --> 04:26:02.040 align:start position:0%
occur in New Hampshire includes
 
04:26:04.070 --> 04:26:04.080 align:start position:0%
the parents or Guardians applying and
 
04:26:06.530 --> 04:26:06.540 align:start position:0%
writing to the judicial branch Family
 
04:26:09.410 --> 04:26:09.420 align:start position:0%

04:26:11.990 --> 04:26:12.000 align:start position:0%
marriage as part of the decision-making
 
04:26:14.450 --> 04:26:14.460 align:start position:0%
process the court May conduct an
 
04:26:17.149 --> 04:26:17.159 align:start position:0%
in-camera interview of each person under
 
04:26:19.849 --> 04:26:19.859 align:start position:0%

04:26:24.170 --> 04:26:24.180 align:start position:0%
the proposed marriage present
 
04:26:26.570 --> 04:26:26.580 align:start position:0%
no permission shall be granted to
 
04:26:28.969 --> 04:26:28.979 align:start position:0%
persons below the age of consent if both
 
04:26:31.309 --> 04:26:31.319 align:start position:0%
parties are non-residents
 
04:26:34.550 --> 04:26:34.560 align:start position:0%
in no circumstance shall a Justice or
 
04:26:37.309 --> 04:26:37.319 align:start position:0%
judge Grant permission to marry if
 
04:26:40.189 --> 04:26:40.199 align:start position:0%
sexual contact or sexual sexual
 
04:26:42.349 --> 04:26:42.359 align:start position:0%
penetration between the parties would
 
04:26:44.510 --> 04:26:44.520 align:start position:0%
but for the solemnization of the
 
04:26:46.490 --> 04:26:46.500 align:start position:0%
proposed marriage constitutes sexual
 
04:26:49.070 --> 04:26:49.080 align:start position:0%
assault felonious sexual assault or
 
04:26:52.309 --> 04:26:52.319 align:start position:0%
aggravated felonious sexual assault
 
04:26:54.410 --> 04:26:54.420 align:start position:0%
permission to contract such marriage
 
04:26:56.630 --> 04:26:56.640 align:start position:0%
shall be granted only upon clear and
 
04:26:58.969 --> 04:26:58.979 align:start position:0%
convincing evidence that the marriage is
 
04:27:00.950 --> 04:27:00.960 align:start position:0%
in the best interest of the person or
 
04:27:04.250 --> 04:27:04.260 align:start position:0%
persons below the age of consent
 
04:27:06.830 --> 04:27:06.840 align:start position:0%
and they're very rare instance that an
 
04:27:09.710 --> 04:27:09.720 align:start position:0%
underage marriage should occur statute
 
04:27:12.290 --> 04:27:12.300 align:start position:0%
protects the minor in such that the
 
04:27:14.149 --> 04:27:14.159 align:start position:0%
certificate of marriage shall provide
 
04:27:16.910 --> 04:27:16.920 align:start position:0%
evidence of a Minor's emancipation
 
04:27:19.550 --> 04:27:19.560 align:start position:0%
by the act of emancipation the minor can
 
04:27:22.189 --> 04:27:22.199 align:start position:0%
file court cases enter contracts and
 
04:27:24.349 --> 04:27:24.359 align:start position:0%

themselves
 
04:27:28.490 --> 04:27:28.500 align:start position:0%
a concern that was heard in testimony in
 
04:27:31.370 --> 04:27:31.380 align:start position:0%
our committee was that as a minor the
 
04:27:33.950 --> 04:27:33.960 align:start position:0%
husband or wife wouldn't have access to
 
04:27:36.469 --> 04:27:36.479 align:start position:0%
domestic violence advocacy should they
 
04:27:39.110 --> 04:27:39.120 align:start position:0%
become a victim of abuse that's just not
 
04:27:41.630 --> 04:27:41.640 align:start position:0%
the case in fact stakeholders have
 
04:27:43.610 --> 04:27:43.620 align:start position:0%
Outreach programs to get help for teens
 
04:27:46.130 --> 04:27:46.140 align:start position:0%
who are victims of partner abuse
 
04:27:48.410 --> 04:27:48.420 align:start position:0%
this brings me to share some concerning
 
04:27:51.710 --> 04:27:51.720 align:start position:0%
data a study conducted by UNH revealed
 
04:27:53.450 --> 04:27:53.460 align:start position:0%
that one in 10 teenagers in a
 
04:27:55.910 --> 04:27:55.920 align:start position:0%
heterosexual relationship reported being
 
04:27:58.429 --> 04:27:58.439 align:start position:0%
a victim of teen physical and or sexual
 
04:28:01.130 --> 04:28:01.140 align:start position:0%
Dating Violence in the prior year with
 
04:28:03.769 --> 04:28:03.779 align:start position:0%
sexual minority teens reporting rates
 
04:28:05.630 --> 04:28:05.640 align:start position:0%
more than twice that of teens and
 
04:28:08.090 --> 04:28:08.100 align:start position:0%
heterosexual relationships
 
04:28:11.149 --> 04:28:11.159 align:start position:0%
HB 34 would do nothing to help these
 
04:28:13.490 --> 04:28:13.500 align:start position:0%
unmarried teens who are experiencing
 
04:28:16.490 --> 04:28:16.500 align:start position:0%
abuse from a partner as legislators and
 
04:28:18.469 --> 04:28:18.479 align:start position:0%
Community leaders we need to put our
 
04:28:20.570 --> 04:28:20.580 align:start position:0%
efforts into helping this population of
 
04:28:23.630 --> 04:28:23.640 align:start position:0%
teens where the real problem is not
 
04:28:25.670 --> 04:28:25.680 align:start position:0%
support legislation to fix a problem
 
04:28:28.370 --> 04:28:28.380 align:start position:0%
that isn't and for these reasons I ask

thank you Mr Speaker
 
04:36:56.330 --> 04:36:56.340 align:start position:0%
if I know this bill proposes that within

the national and State history and
 
04:37:00.650 --> 04:37:00.660 align:start position:0%
government classes that instruction
 
04:37:04.250 --> 04:37:04.260 align:start position:0%
include Armenian Genocide the Holocaust

country
 
04:37:19.490 --> 04:37:19.500 align:start position:0%
if I know that student knowledge of
 
04:37:22.310 --> 04:37:22.320 align:start position:0%
genocide end of the Holocaust are
 
04:37:24.051 --> 04:37:24.061 align:start position:0%
required as part of an adequate
 
04:37:27.890 --> 04:37:27.900 align:start position:0%
education pursuant to RSA 193e thus
 
04:37:30.410 --> 04:37:30.420 align:start position:0%
making this bill duplicative
 
04:37:32.990 --> 04:37:33.000 align:start position:0%
if I further know the council general of
 
04:37:35.051 --> 04:37:35.061 align:start position:0%
the Turkish Consulate in Boston
 
04:37:38.750 --> 04:37:38.760 align:start position:0%
communicated educating young minds with
 
04:37:40.189 --> 04:37:40.199 align:start position:0%
such a curriculum
 
04:37:42.830 --> 04:37:42.840 align:start position:0%
would also potentially risk the exposure
 
04:37:44.810 --> 04:37:44.820 align:start position:0%
of young children of the law abiding
 
04:37:47.209 --> 04:37:47.219 align:start position:0%
Turkish Armenian community in New
 
04:37:49.369 --> 04:37:49.379 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to discrimination and
 
04:37:52.189 --> 04:37:52.199 align:start position:0%
disenfranchence franchisement in schools
 
04:37:55.131 --> 04:37:55.141 align:start position:0%
and elsewhere and lastly if I also know
 
04:37:57.590 --> 04:37:57.600 align:start position:0%
this bill would result in Department
 
04:37:59.869 --> 04:37:59.879 align:start position:0%
having to purchase additional
 
04:38:01.970 --> 04:38:01.980 align:start position:0%
instructional materials for a
 
04:38:03.769 --> 04:38:03.779 align:start position:0%
distribution to Public Schools as well
 
04:38:05.810 --> 04:38:05.820 align:start position:0%
as hiring an additional part-time
 
04:38:08.029 --> 04:38:08.039 align:start position:0%
employee to oversee this requirement
 
04:38:10.429 --> 04:38:10.439 align:start position:0%
would I then press the green button to
 
04:38:14.330 --> 04:38:14.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:16.131 --> 04:38:16.141 align:start position:0%

04:38:21.769 --> 04:38:21.779 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
04:38:26.330 --> 04:38:26.340 align:start position:0%
if I know that HB 309 is not necessary
 
04:38:28.369 --> 04:38:28.379 align:start position:0%
because the content of this bill is
 
04:38:29.990 --> 04:38:30.000 align:start position:0%
already part of the state curriculum
 
04:38:32.929 --> 04:38:32.939 align:start position:0%
dictated by the academic standards of
 
04:38:34.970 --> 04:38:34.980 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education
 
04:38:37.631 --> 04:38:37.641 align:start position:0%
and if I know that the current statutes
 
04:38:41.150 --> 04:38:41.160 align:start position:0%
authorize local control by school boards
 
04:38:43.189 --> 04:38:43.199 align:start position:0%
to determine the manner in which
 
04:38:45.349 --> 04:38:45.359 align:start position:0%
curriculum will be delivered
 
04:38:47.929 --> 04:38:47.939 align:start position:0%
if I know that this very bill was
 
04:38:51.769 --> 04:38:51.779 align:start position:0%
considered in 2022 house session and was
 
04:38:53.929 --> 04:38:53.939 align:start position:0%
not deemed ready for consideration by
 
04:38:55.070 --> 04:38:55.080 align:start position:0%
this body
 
04:38:58.429 --> 04:38:58.439 align:start position:0%
if I know these facts Mr Speaker would I
 
04:39:01.490 --> 04:39:01.500 align:start position:0%
now press the red button so that an
 
04:39:03.230 --> 04:39:03.240 align:start position:0%
alternative motion can be placed before
 
04:39:07.609 --> 04:39:07.619 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:09.289 --> 04:39:09.299 align:start position:0%
the question is whether to lay House
 
04:39:11.689 --> 04:39:11.699 align:start position:0%
Bill 309 on the table this is a division
 
04:39:14.150 --> 04:39:14.160 align:start position:0%
vote if you're in favor of tabling
 
04:39:16.070 --> 04:39:16.080 align:start position:0%
you'll press the green button if you're
 
04:39:17.570 --> 04:39:17.580 align:start position:0%
opposed you'll press the red button

the house will attend to the state of

04:40:24.050 --> 04:40:24.060 align:start position:0%

this Run Deep

this history
 
04:41:12.430 --> 04:41:12.440 align:start position:0%

04:41:14.810 --> 04:41:14.820 align:start position:0%
misunderstandings about what has
 
04:41:14.820 --> 04:41:16.070 align:start position:0%
misunderstandings about what has
happened

04:41:16.070 --> 04:41:16.080 align:start position:0%
happened
 
04:41:18.590 --> 04:41:18.600 align:start position:0%
about whether people who are still who

are not alive who are descendants of
 
04:41:22.550 --> 04:41:22.560 align:start position:0%
those on either side should be held
 
04:41:24.650 --> 04:41:24.660 align:start position:0%
accountable and they shouldn't
 
04:41:27.830 --> 04:41:27.840 align:start position:0%
there is no Turk alive today who

participated in the Armenian Genocide
 
04:41:32.868 --> 04:41:32.878 align:start position:0%
just as other tragedies throughout
 
04:41:35.868 --> 04:41:35.878 align:start position:0%
history were not part of it we still

have great understandings under

misunderstandings about how this can
 
04:41:41.810 --> 04:41:41.820 align:start position:0%
happen how people that were once friends
 
04:41:44.930 --> 04:41:44.940 align:start position:0%
could end up slaughtering each other and
 
04:41:47.208 --> 04:41:47.218 align:start position:0%
it requires a curriculum that can help
 
04:41:49.850 --> 04:41:49.860 align:start position:0%
us get into these deep issues and look
 
04:41:52.430 --> 04:41:52.440 align:start position:0%
at them and try and understand how we
 
04:41:54.170 --> 04:41:54.180 align:start position:0%
can prevent ourselves and how we can
 
04:41:56.810 --> 04:41:56.820 align:start position:0%
prevent others from falling from
 
04:41:59.750 --> 04:41:59.760 align:start position:0%
disagreement to Great tragedy
 
04:42:01.788 --> 04:42:01.798 align:start position:0%
while this bill is not perfect the
 
04:42:03.650 --> 04:42:03.660 align:start position:0%
amendment does make it better by
 
04:42:06.350 --> 04:42:06.360 align:start position:0%
recognizing other tragedies the Holloman

the Trail of Tears and others and it's
 
04:42:12.708 --> 04:42:12.718 align:start position:0%
not exclusionary the point is to make
 
04:42:16.368 --> 04:42:16.378 align:start position:0%
people realize the tragedy happens the
 
04:42:18.230 --> 04:42:18.240 align:start position:0%
unspeaking Unspeakable happens between
 
04:42:21.110 --> 04:42:21.120 align:start position:0%
groups and we need to understand that
 
04:42:22.970 --> 04:42:22.980 align:start position:0%
and recognize that the member will
 
04:42:25.010 --> 04:42:25.020 align:start position:0%
suspend for a moment
 
04:42:26.810 --> 04:42:26.820 align:start position:0%
it's like to remind you there is no
 
04:42:28.850 --> 04:42:28.860 align:start position:0%
Amendment before us right now I
 
04:42:28.860 --> 04:42:29.930 align:start position:0%
Amendment before us right now I
apologize

04:42:29.930 --> 04:42:29.940 align:start position:0%
apologize
 
04:42:33.890 --> 04:42:33.900 align:start position:0%
I apologize Mr speaker so if there was a
 
04:42:36.230 --> 04:42:36.240 align:start position:0%
emotion but this bill should be able to
 
04:42:38.510 --> 04:42:38.520 align:start position:0%
continue on so that another motion can
 
04:42:41.270 --> 04:42:41.280 align:start position:0%
be made because we need to look at how
 
04:42:43.430 --> 04:42:43.440 align:start position:0%
individuals can end up
 
04:42:46.310 --> 04:42:46.320 align:start position:0%
being parts of packs of rabid animals
 
04:42:48.350 --> 04:42:48.360 align:start position:0%
trying to kill each other
 
04:42:51.110 --> 04:42:51.120 align:start position:0%
that is a very and I'm not speaking to
 
04:42:52.850 --> 04:42:52.860 align:start position:0%

Warren groups have done this from time
 
04:42:57.770 --> 04:42:57.780 align:start position:0%

Bill 309 was recommended in expedient to
 
04:43:25.730 --> 04:43:25.740 align:start position:0%
legislate with a strong bipartisan vote
 
04:43:28.610 --> 04:43:28.620 align:start position:0%
of 12 to 8. the committee rejected the
 
04:43:31.010 --> 04:43:31.020 align:start position:0%
bill for many reasons but in the
 
04:43:31.020 --> 04:43:31.910 align:start position:0%
bill for many reasons but in the
nutshell

04:43:31.910 --> 04:43:31.920 align:start position:0%
nutshell
 
04:43:34.368 --> 04:43:34.378 align:start position:0%
current law already establishes the
 
04:43:36.708 --> 04:43:36.718 align:start position:0%
content of inadequate education and
 
04:43:39.110 --> 04:43:39.120 align:start position:0%
grants authority to school districts to
 
04:43:40.610 --> 04:43:40.620 align:start position:0%
develop curriculum
 
04:43:42.830 --> 04:43:42.840 align:start position:0%
for those content areas
 
04:43:45.230 --> 04:43:45.240 align:start position:0%
this bill is unnecessary and constitutes
 
04:43:47.330 --> 04:43:47.340 align:start position:0%
an overreach of state government to
 
04:43:49.910 --> 04:43:49.920 align:start position:0%
impose strict curriculum requirements on
 
04:43:52.550 --> 04:43:52.560 align:start position:0%
every school in every city and town
 
04:43:54.650 --> 04:43:54.660 align:start position:0%
across the state
 
04:43:56.990 --> 04:43:57.000 align:start position:0%
many residents also found the bill to be
 
04:43:59.750 --> 04:43:59.760 align:start position:0%
offensive and risks exposing children to
 
04:44:02.868 --> 04:44:02.878 align:start position:0%
discrimination in schools and in their
 
04:44:02.878 --> 04:44:03.948 align:start position:0%
discrimination in schools and in their
communities

04:44:03.948 --> 04:44:03.958 align:start position:0%
communities
 
04:44:06.288 --> 04:44:06.298 align:start position:0%
its heavy-handed big government and most
 
04:44:08.150 --> 04:44:08.160 align:start position:0%
definitely not the New Hampshire way
 
04:44:10.550 --> 04:44:10.560 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr Speaker
 
04:46:00.708 --> 04:46:00.718 align:start position:0%
if I know that HB 309 is not necessary
 
04:46:02.628 --> 04:46:02.638 align:start position:0%
because the content of this bill is
 
04:46:04.850 --> 04:46:04.860 align:start position:0%
already part of the curriculum dictated

Department of Education
 
04:46:10.850 --> 04:46:10.860 align:start position:0%
and if I know that the current statutes
 
04:46:13.850 --> 04:46:13.860 align:start position:0%
authorize local control by school boards
 
04:46:15.350 --> 04:46:15.360 align:start position:0%
to determine the manner in which
 
04:46:18.050 --> 04:46:18.060 align:start position:0%
curriculum will be delivered and if I
 
04:46:20.510 --> 04:46:20.520 align:start position:0%
know that this very bill was considered
 
04:46:24.890 --> 04:46:24.900 align:start position:0%
in 2022 in this session it was not
 
04:46:26.930 --> 04:46:26.940 align:start position:0%
deemed ready for consideration by this
 
04:46:28.850 --> 04:46:28.860 align:start position:0%

if I know that children perform better

in school when they're not hungry and if
 
04:55:03.890 --> 04:55:03.900 align:start position:0%
I know that 456 New Hampshire Public

provide healthy meals for more children

04:55:18.288 --> 04:55:18.298 align:start position:0%
I believe that feeding hungry children
 
04:55:20.690 --> 04:55:20.700 align:start position:0%
is not just a democratic issue or a
 
04:55:22.610 --> 04:55:22.620 align:start position:0%
republican issue but one on which we
 
04:55:25.610 --> 04:55:25.620 align:start position:0%
should all agree that now I would say we
 
04:55:28.070 --> 04:55:28.080 align:start position:0%
should table the legislation and bring
 
04:55:30.288 --> 04:55:30.298 align:start position:0%

04:58:36.110 --> 04:58:36.120 align:start position:0%
instead it is detrimental to low-income

students wishing to put their families
 
04:58:43.250 --> 04:58:43.260 align:start position:0%
tax dollars towards choice
 
04:58:45.530 --> 04:58:45.540 align:start position:0%

differently according to the Nea
 
04:58:51.288 --> 04:58:51.298 align:start position:0%
therefore education is not meant to be
 
04:58:53.810 --> 04:58:53.820 align:start position:0%
one size fits all
 
04:58:57.230 --> 04:58:57.240 align:start position:0%
moreover no student should be barred

from educational Excellence based on
 
04:59:02.868 --> 04:59:02.878 align:start position:0%
their parents ability to pay
 
04:59:06.350 --> 04:59:06.360 align:start position:0%
the current program provides these EFA

contains no exception for siblings or
 
04:59:22.390 --> 04:59:22.400 align:start position:0%
students already qualified for an EFA
 
04:59:24.948 --> 04:59:24.958 align:start position:0%
that would harm parents who would be
 
04:59:28.610 --> 04:59:28.620 align:start position:0%
forced to drive between multiple schools
 
04:59:31.430 --> 04:59:31.440 align:start position:0%
this is an unnecessary hardship on

Granite State families including those

home too
 
04:59:40.670 --> 04:59:40.680 align:start position:0%
by restricting access to those who have

students
 
04:59:51.110 --> 04:59:51.120 align:start position:0%
as a result this would discourage
 
04:59:53.868 --> 04:59:53.878 align:start position:0%
settling down here
 
04:59:56.570 --> 04:59:56.580 align:start position:0%
we would lose our Workforce potential

only did I vote no I yelled no way

I continue to say that in front of you
 
05:00:17.750 --> 05:00:17.760 align:start position:0%
as a product to public schools and as a
 
05:00:21.410 --> 05:00:21.420 align:start position:0%
recent graduate of a public school
 
05:00:24.890 --> 05:00:24.900 align:start position:0%
but the model does not fit every student
 
05:00:27.948 --> 05:00:27.958 align:start position:0%
EFA students Excel and exceed
 
05:00:31.910 --> 05:00:31.920 align:start position:0%
expectations despite economic adversity
 
05:00:34.850 --> 05:00:34.860 align:start position:0%
that is why access should not be delayed
 
05:00:39.410 --> 05:00:39.420 align:start position:0%
an entire year at the child's expense
 
05:00:42.948 --> 05:00:42.958 align:start position:0%
in the words of Reverend Dr King Jr or
 
05:00:46.368 --> 05:00:46.378 align:start position:0%
write delayed is a right denied

finally knowing that the program was

05:00:59.750 --> 05:00:59.760 align:start position:0%
attempt to restrict access must be

05:01:50.090 --> 05:01:50.100 align:start position:0%
Public Schools
 
05:01:53.090 --> 05:01:53.100 align:start position:0%
and needed to make a change
 
05:01:55.550 --> 05:01:55.560 align:start position:0%
to provide an alternative to their local
 
05:01:56.990 --> 05:01:57.000 align:start position:0%
public school
 
05:01:58.910 --> 05:01:58.920 align:start position:0%
of course we all know that's not true
 
05:02:01.250 --> 05:02:01.260 align:start position:0%
other alternatives are and have been
 
05:02:03.170 --> 05:02:03.180 align:start position:0%
available to all students and families
 
05:02:06.050 --> 05:02:06.060 align:start position:0%

state's relatively new manifest hardship
 
05:02:15.788 --> 05:02:15.798 align:start position:0%

05:02:23.810 --> 05:02:23.820 align:start position:0%
but still the commissioner of Education

students who do not have the resources
 
05:02:31.788 --> 05:02:31.798 align:start position:0%
to leave their public school and choose
 
05:02:34.550 --> 05:02:34.560 align:start position:0%
an alternative for their education needs
 
05:02:37.910 --> 05:02:37.920 align:start position:0%
and and this is a big point to so in a
 
05:02:40.310 --> 05:02:40.320 align:start position:0%
way that results in substantial savings
 
05:02:42.770 --> 05:02:42.780 align:start position:0%
for the local property taxpayer so they
 
05:02:45.650 --> 05:02:45.660 align:start position:0%
would no longer have to pay the local
 
05:02:48.590 --> 05:02:48.600 align:start position:0%
cost to educate that student
 
05:02:50.750 --> 05:02:50.760 align:start position:0%
but that's not what happened
 
05:02:52.670 --> 05:02:52.680 align:start position:0%
according to the Department of Education
 
05:02:55.250 --> 05:02:55.260 align:start position:0%
there are currently three thousand
 
05:02:57.470 --> 05:02:57.480 align:start position:0%
twenty five children enrolled in the EFA
 
05:03:00.590 --> 05:03:00.600 align:start position:0%
program that is offering grants totaling
 
05:03:03.288 --> 05:03:03.298 align:start position:0%
nearly 15 million dollars this school
 
05:03:06.410 --> 05:03:06.420 align:start position:0%
year the cost to taxpayers would be
 
05:03:10.010 --> 05:03:10.020 align:start position:0%
about 65 million dollars if those 3 000
 
05:03:13.610 --> 05:03:13.620 align:start position:0%
students who are all eligible attended a
 
05:03:15.770 --> 05:03:15.780 align:start position:0%
traditional public school that's a

but also according to the department
 
05:03:25.788 --> 05:03:25.798 align:start position:0%
only about 680 students actually left
 
05:03:28.610 --> 05:03:28.620 align:start position:0%
their public school to join the program
 
05:03:31.310 --> 05:03:31.320 align:start position:0%
vast majority of students were not
 
05:03:33.708 --> 05:03:33.718 align:start position:0%
attending public school at all they were
 
05:03:36.050 --> 05:03:36.060 align:start position:0%
already at private schools or home
 
05:03:38.810 --> 05:03:38.820 align:start position:0%
schools but in any event they certainly
 
05:03:41.090 --> 05:03:41.100 align:start position:0%
weren't costing taxpayers 65 million
 
05:03:41.100 --> 05:03:42.350 align:start position:0%
weren't costing taxpayers 65 million
dollars

05:03:42.350 --> 05:03:42.360 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
05:03:45.530 --> 05:03:45.540 align:start position:0%
in fact they were costing taxpayers
 
05:03:45.540 --> 05:03:46.430 align:start position:0%
in fact they were costing taxpayers
nothing

05:03:46.430 --> 05:03:46.440 align:start position:0%
nothing
 
05:03:48.170 --> 05:03:48.180 align:start position:0%
say that again
 
05:03:50.810 --> 05:03:50.820 align:start position:0%
based on the Department's own numbers 80
 
05:03:53.930 --> 05:03:53.940 align:start position:0%
percent of EFA students were already in
 
05:03:56.390 --> 05:03:56.400 align:start position:0%
private or home schools and not costing
 
05:03:59.330 --> 05:03:59.340 align:start position:0%
taxpayers a dime
 
05:04:02.110 --> 05:04:02.120 align:start position:0%
a program was enacted as part of the
 
05:04:05.208 --> 05:04:05.218 align:start position:0%
2022-2023 state budget to give students
 
05:04:07.550 --> 05:04:07.560 align:start position:0%
attending Public Schools a choice in the
 
05:04:07.560 --> 05:04:08.750 align:start position:0%
attending Public Schools a choice in the
education

05:04:08.750 --> 05:04:08.760 align:start position:0%
education
 
05:04:11.510 --> 05:04:11.520 align:start position:0%
with an estimated cost to taxpayers in
 
05:04:14.510 --> 05:04:14.520 align:start position:0%
the budget of three million dollars
 
05:04:16.610 --> 05:04:16.620 align:start position:0%
but because nearly all of the students
 
05:04:18.288 --> 05:04:18.298 align:start position:0%
now in the program were already
 
05:04:20.628 --> 05:04:20.638 align:start position:0%
attending private or home schools the
 
05:04:23.570 --> 05:04:23.580 align:start position:0%
EFA program has cost taxpayers more than
 
05:04:26.628 --> 05:04:26.638 align:start position:0%
23 million dollars so far and the
 
05:04:28.610 --> 05:04:28.620 align:start position:0%
commissioner of education has requested
 
05:04:31.730 --> 05:04:31.740 align:start position:0%
an additional 60 million dollars for the
 
05:04:33.948 --> 05:04:33.958 align:start position:0%
next two years as one of our
 
05:04:36.410 --> 05:04:36.420 align:start position:0%
constituents said to me quote there's
 
05:04:39.650 --> 05:04:39.660 align:start position:0%
nothing conservative about this program
 
05:04:42.830 --> 05:04:42.840 align:start position:0%
so House Bill 430 clears this up saves
 
05:04:45.110 --> 05:04:45.120 align:start position:0%
taxpayers millions of dollars and makes
 
05:04:47.690 --> 05:04:47.700 align:start position:0%
sure the EFA program doesn't turn into a
 
05:04:49.670 --> 05:04:49.680 align:start position:0%
taxpayer-funded private school tuition
 
05:04:53.030 --> 05:04:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:55.250 --> 05:04:55.260 align:start position:0%
well simply requires students to be
 
05:04:57.470 --> 05:04:57.480 align:start position:0%
enrolled in their public school when
 
05:05:00.770 --> 05:05:00.780 align:start position:0%
they apply for an EFA exception is made
 
05:05:01.970 --> 05:05:01.980 align:start position:0%
for students who are entering
 
05:05:04.788 --> 05:05:04.798 align:start position:0%
kindergarten or first grade
 
05:05:06.708 --> 05:05:06.718 align:start position:0%
we're committed to improving the
 
05:05:08.570 --> 05:05:08.580 align:start position:0%
accountability oversight and
 
05:05:11.990 --> 05:05:12.000 align:start position:0%
transparency of the EFA program would
 
05:05:13.610 --> 05:05:13.620 align:start position:0%
the commissioner now asking for 60
 
05:05:16.490 --> 05:05:16.500 align:start position:0%
million dollars more of taxpayer money
 
05:05:18.708 --> 05:05:18.718 align:start position:0%
in the next budget it's more important
 
05:05:21.050 --> 05:05:21.060 align:start position:0%
than ever that taxpayers know how their
 
05:05:25.310 --> 05:05:25.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:27.890 --> 05:05:27.900 align:start position:0%

05:05:29.750 --> 05:05:29.760 align:start position:0%

05:07:01.550 --> 05:07:01.560 align:start position:0%
the motion before us is ought to pass on

Mr Speaker
 
05:07:25.128 --> 05:07:25.138 align:start position:0%
if I know that the purpose of Education
 
05:07:28.610 --> 05:07:28.620 align:start position:0%
Freedom accounts is to enable parents to
 
05:07:30.350 --> 05:07:30.360 align:start position:0%
send their children to the school of
 
05:07:31.850 --> 05:07:31.860 align:start position:0%
their choice
 
05:07:34.490 --> 05:07:34.500 align:start position:0%
and if I believe
 
05:07:37.128 --> 05:07:37.138 align:start position:0%
that it is unreasonable to require
 
05:07:40.970 --> 05:07:40.980 align:start position:0%
parents to First send their children to
 
05:07:44.510 --> 05:07:44.520 align:start position:0%
a school that is not of their choice in
 
05:07:46.910 --> 05:07:46.920 align:start position:0%
order to qualify for an education
 
05:07:49.310 --> 05:07:49.320 align:start position:0%
Freedom account
 
05:07:50.990 --> 05:07:51.000 align:start position:0%
and finally
 
05:07:54.110 --> 05:07:54.120 align:start position:0%
if I believe that parents unencumbered
 
05:07:57.110 --> 05:07:57.120 align:start position:0%
by the state have the fundamental right
 
05:07:59.628 --> 05:07:59.638 align:start position:0%
to decide how their children are
 
05:07:59.638 --> 05:08:02.150 align:start position:0%
to decide how their children are
educated

05:08:02.150 --> 05:08:02.160 align:start position:0%
educated
 
05:08:04.970 --> 05:08:04.980 align:start position:0%
to support increased Educational
 
05:08:09.288 --> 05:08:09.298 align:start position:0%
Opportunity would I now vote no and push
 
05:08:12.410 --> 05:08:12.420 align:start position:0%
the red button
 
05:08:14.390 --> 05:08:14.400 align:start position:0%
do you recognize representative Milo for
 
05:08:17.510 --> 05:08:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:20.390 --> 05:08:20.400 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
05:08:25.430 --> 05:08:25.440 align:start position:0%
if I know that of the 3200 EFA taxpayer
 
05:08:29.230 --> 05:08:29.240 align:start position:0%
vouchers issued only 100 of the students
 
05:08:31.430 --> 05:08:31.440 align:start position:0%
switching out of the public schools
 
05:08:34.128 --> 05:08:34.138 align:start position:0%
meaning that the other EFA participants
 
05:08:36.708 --> 05:08:36.718 align:start position:0%
had already been in private or religious
 
05:08:36.718 --> 05:08:37.730 align:start position:0%
had already been in private or religious
schools

05:08:37.730 --> 05:08:37.740 align:start position:0%
schools
 
05:08:39.530 --> 05:08:39.540 align:start position:0%
and if I believe that the current
 
05:08:42.530 --> 05:08:42.540 align:start position:0%
recipients of the EFA vouchers had
 
05:08:45.050 --> 05:08:45.060 align:start position:0%
already chosen private and religious
 
05:08:45.060 --> 05:08:46.128 align:start position:0%
already chosen private and religious
schools

05:08:46.128 --> 05:08:46.138 align:start position:0%
schools
 
05:08:49.788 --> 05:08:49.798 align:start position:0%
if I believe that HB 430 restores the
 
05:08:52.788 --> 05:08:52.798 align:start position:0%
original intent of the taxpayer vouchers
 
05:08:55.430 --> 05:08:55.440 align:start position:0%
allowing public school students to
 
05:08:58.368 --> 05:08:58.378 align:start position:0%
exercise their school choice option
 
05:09:00.470 --> 05:09:00.480 align:start position:0%
if I believe these facts Mr Speaker
 
05:09:04.128 --> 05:09:04.138 align:start position:0%

brief I just wanted to say that the
 
05:15:26.510 --> 05:15:26.520 align:start position:0%
amendment is an oversight the um of the
 
05:15:29.270 --> 05:15:29.280 align:start position:0%
in drafting and that it didn't add the
 
05:15:31.550 --> 05:15:31.560 align:start position:0%
state's part of the reimbursement policy
 
05:15:34.190 --> 05:15:34.200 align:start position:0%
to the appropriation so the amendment
 
05:15:37.490 --> 05:15:37.500 align:start position:0%
shows the um two to one ratio of federal
 
05:15:39.890 --> 05:15:39.900 align:start position:0%
state federal to State money that we are
 
05:15:39.900 --> 05:15:41.150 align:start position:0%

Hampshire Farm to school program this
 
05:17:40.490 --> 05:17:40.500 align:start position:0%
amendment appropriates the sum of 745
 
05:17:42.830 --> 05:17:42.840 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars for the fiscal year
 
05:17:46.610 --> 05:17:46.620 align:start position:0%
ending June 30 2024.

05:17:55.850 --> 05:17:55.860 align:start position:0%

and if I also understand that such an
 
05:18:10.430 --> 05:18:10.440 align:start position:0%
expense is not necessary as schools May
 
05:18:13.070 --> 05:18:13.080 align:start position:0%
currently contract and work with local
 
05:18:15.530 --> 05:18:15.540 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr Speaker if I know that this
 
05:18:33.050 --> 05:18:33.060 align:start position:0%
amendment is not only a Sound Investment
 
05:18:34.910 --> 05:18:34.920 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire's children but also an
 
05:18:36.650 --> 05:18:36.660 align:start position:0%
investment in our challenging farming
 
05:18:38.448 --> 05:18:38.458 align:start position:0%
industry and our local New Hampshire
 
05:18:41.150 --> 05:18:41.160 align:start position:0%
economy and if I further know that by
 
05:18:42.530 --> 05:18:42.540 align:start position:0%
supporting local farming and
 
05:18:44.208 --> 05:18:44.218 align:start position:0%

knowledge of where our food comes from
 
05:18:52.250 --> 05:18:52.260 align:start position:0%
would become a conversation at lunch
 
05:18:54.590 --> 05:18:54.600 align:start position:0%
tables across New Hampshire and if I
 
05:18:56.990 --> 05:18:57.000 align:start position:0%
further know that local economies would
 
05:18:58.990 --> 05:18:59.000 align:start position:0%
then be supported while feeding children
 
05:19:01.788 --> 05:19:01.798 align:start position:0%
more than nutritionally dense food would
 
05:19:03.770 --> 05:19:03.780 align:start position:0%
I now press the green button in support
 
05:19:05.570 --> 05:19:05.580 align:start position:0%

I Rise before you today to ask that you
 
05:21:20.868 --> 05:21:20.878 align:start position:0%
vote no on House Bill 487.
 
05:21:22.670 --> 05:21:22.680 align:start position:0%
we can all agree that New Hampshire
 
05:21:25.128 --> 05:21:25.138 align:start position:0%
values its extensive history of farming
 
05:21:27.170 --> 05:21:27.180 align:start position:0%
the quaintness of the New England Farm
 
05:21:29.390 --> 05:21:29.400 align:start position:0%
and the contribution of farms to our
 
05:21:30.948 --> 05:21:30.958 align:start position:0%
vibrant local communities and
 
05:21:30.958 --> 05:21:32.390 align:start position:0%

agritourism
 
05:21:34.850 --> 05:21:34.860 align:start position:0%
we can also agree that good nutrition is
 
05:21:37.190 --> 05:21:37.200 align:start position:0%
of the utmost important to importance to
 
05:21:39.230 --> 05:21:39.240 align:start position:0%

05:21:43.850 --> 05:21:43.860 align:start position:0%
however this program is unnecessary in
 
05:21:45.650 --> 05:21:45.660 align:start position:0%
our schools at this time
 
05:21:47.690 --> 05:21:47.700 align:start position:0%
for one reason there is nothing to
 
05:21:49.670 --> 05:21:49.680 align:start position:0%
prevent local school districts from
 
05:21:51.530 --> 05:21:51.540 align:start position:0%
establishing such a program
 
05:21:53.690 --> 05:21:53.700 align:start position:0%
the state gives districts local control
 
05:21:56.030 --> 05:21:56.040 align:start position:0%
and they are welcome to reach out to
 
05:21:58.250 --> 05:21:58.260 align:start position:0%
Farms across the state to determine what
 
05:21:59.810 --> 05:21:59.820 align:start position:0%
local products are available for
 
05:22:01.310 --> 05:22:01.320 align:start position:0%

05:22:03.910 --> 05:22:03.920 align:start position:0%
there are already
 
05:22:07.310 --> 05:22:07.320 align:start position:0%
175 such programs established across the
 
05:22:09.590 --> 05:22:09.600 align:start position:0%

05:22:15.288 --> 05:22:15.298 align:start position:0%
only schools that participate in the
 
05:22:17.090 --> 05:22:17.100 align:start position:0%
national school lunch program would be
 
05:22:20.510 --> 05:22:20.520 align:start position:0%
eligible for Farm to school benefits
 
05:22:22.670 --> 05:22:22.680 align:start position:0%
this bill would also require the
 
05:22:24.590 --> 05:22:24.600 align:start position:0%
establishment of a new position in the
 
05:22:26.990 --> 05:22:27.000 align:start position:0%
department of education for the sole
 
05:22:29.628 --> 05:22:29.638 align:start position:0%
purpose of administering this program
 
05:22:31.610 --> 05:22:31.620 align:start position:0%
there would be an initial cost to the
 
05:22:33.170 --> 05:22:33.180 align:start position:0%
state of one hundred and forty five
 
05:22:35.330 --> 05:22:35.340 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars just to establish this
 
05:22:35.340 --> 05:22:36.530 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars just to establish this

05:22:36.530 --> 05:22:36.540 align:start position:0%
position
 
05:22:38.330 --> 05:22:38.340 align:start position:0%
fifty thousand dollars for the purpose
 
05:22:40.250 --> 05:22:40.260 align:start position:0%
of the technology to write the code for
 
05:22:42.650 --> 05:22:42.660 align:start position:0%
its Administration and schools will be
 
05:22:45.590 --> 05:22:45.600 align:start position:0%
only eligible to receive up to twelve
 
05:22:48.590 --> 05:22:48.600 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars in reimbursement I'm
 
05:22:50.510 --> 05:22:50.520 align:start position:0%
pretty sure twelve hundred dollars is
 
05:22:52.850 --> 05:22:52.860 align:start position:0%

month
 
05:22:56.208 --> 05:22:56.218 align:start position:0%
I didn't so this
 
05:22:58.310 --> 05:22:58.320 align:start position:0%
this is an additional cost of six
 
05:23:00.288 --> 05:23:00.298 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollars for a total of
 
05:23:03.530 --> 05:23:03.540 align:start position:0%
745 000 that will not lapse
 
05:23:06.110 --> 05:23:06.120 align:start position:0%
finally it is questionable that there
 
05:23:07.910 --> 05:23:07.920 align:start position:0%
are enough Farms willing to participate
 
05:23:10.430 --> 05:23:10.440 align:start position:0%
it is questionable that enough food is
 
05:23:11.930 --> 05:23:11.940 align:start position:0%
grown in New Hampshire to make this a
 
05:23:14.810 --> 05:23:14.820 align:start position:0%
worthwhile Endeavor and we are unsure
 
05:23:16.310 --> 05:23:16.320 align:start position:0%
how many schools would even be
 
05:23:17.930 --> 05:23:17.940 align:start position:0%
interested in taking advantage of this
 
05:23:17.940 --> 05:23:19.070 align:start position:0%

program
 
05:23:21.350 --> 05:23:21.360 align:start position:0%
although we love our farms and we love
 
05:23:24.110 --> 05:23:24.120 align:start position:0%
our children for these reasons I urge
 
05:23:27.470 --> 05:23:27.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:35.150 --> 05:23:35.160 align:start position:0%

grows some of her own food for home use
 
05:23:44.030 --> 05:23:44.040 align:start position:0%
nothing would make the community of
 
05:23:46.070 --> 05:23:46.080 align:start position:0%
folks I represent happier than to see
 
05:23:48.050 --> 05:23:48.060 align:start position:0%
our lunches in schools across New
 
05:23:50.270 --> 05:23:50.280 align:start position:0%

locally sourced meals wherever possible
 
05:23:54.410 --> 05:23:54.420 align:start position:0%
it is true that New Hampshire has a
 
05:23:56.330 --> 05:23:56.340 align:start position:0%
small farming Community when compared to
 
05:23:58.670 --> 05:23:58.680 align:start position:0%
neighboring states but it is also true
 
05:24:00.410 --> 05:24:00.420 align:start position:0%
that those Farms are precious to New
 
05:24:01.788 --> 05:24:01.798 align:start position:0%

Staters our state's Farms fisheries and
 
05:24:08.628 --> 05:24:08.638 align:start position:0%
producers are the lifeline to keeping
 
05:24:10.730 --> 05:24:10.740 align:start position:0%
Regional food in our homes and hopefully
 
05:24:13.128 --> 05:24:13.138 align:start position:0%
with this bill more of it in our school
 
05:24:14.330 --> 05:24:14.340 align:start position:0%
lunches too
 
05:24:16.550 --> 05:24:16.560 align:start position:0%
through this bill the voluntary program
 
05:24:19.190 --> 05:24:19.200 align:start position:0%
will provide New Hampshire K-12 schools

per School
 
05:24:35.990 --> 05:24:36.000 align:start position:0%
participating schools can maximize their
 
05:24:38.030 --> 05:24:38.040 align:start position:0%
reimbursement benefit by spending 300

excuse me three thousand six hundred
 
05:24:41.510 --> 05:24:41.520 align:start position:0%

05:25:00.948 --> 05:25:00.958 align:start position:0%

05:25:07.368 --> 05:25:07.378 align:start position:0%
locally sourced food and ensuring our
 
05:25:09.050 --> 05:25:09.060 align:start position:0%
school lunches better reflect that is
 
05:25:11.270 --> 05:25:11.280 align:start position:0%
important to our constituents this bill
 
05:25:13.128 --> 05:25:13.138 align:start position:0%
has an opportunity through funding for
 
05:25:16.190 --> 05:25:16.200 align:start position:0%
the doe to stand up a program that would
 
05:25:18.410 --> 05:25:18.420 align:start position:0%
continue to further work of connecting
 
05:25:20.090 --> 05:25:20.100 align:start position:0%
our students to the rich variety of
 
05:25:22.250 --> 05:25:22.260 align:start position:0%
locally sourced nutrient-dense foods
 
05:25:23.448 --> 05:25:23.458 align:start position:0%
from New Hampshire
 
05:25:27.170 --> 05:25:27.180 align:start position:0%
that producers grow and make who knows
 
05:25:29.090 --> 05:25:29.100 align:start position:0%
some students may go on to become
 
05:25:31.368 --> 05:25:31.378 align:start position:0%
Farmers Fishers or maple syrup producers
 
05:25:33.230 --> 05:25:33.240 align:start position:0%
as a result of seeing a myriad of Foods
 
05:25:35.330 --> 05:25:35.340 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire can provide to its
 
05:25:37.368 --> 05:25:37.378 align:start position:0%
communities from value-added products
 
05:25:40.190 --> 05:25:40.200 align:start position:0%
like yogurts and squash to squashes and
 
05:25:41.810 --> 05:25:41.820 align:start position:0%
many other types of food we grow and

throughout the state
 
05:26:07.310 --> 05:26:07.320 align:start position:0%
I ask you to support such a creative
 
05:26:08.990 --> 05:26:09.000 align:start position:0%
solution that provides the opportunity
 
05:26:10.610 --> 05:26:10.620 align:start position:0%

while supporting locally nutritious food
 
05:26:17.868 --> 05:26:17.878 align:start position:0%
this bill would help us spend 10 percent

order for this state to do so the food

the definition of local may have to be

if I then believe that this program is
 
05:29:08.628 --> 05:29:08.638 align:start position:0%
not ready would I then press the red

thank you Mr Speaker
 
05:29:20.990 --> 05:29:21.000 align:start position:0%
if I know the amendment cleared up any
 
05:29:24.170 --> 05:29:24.180 align:start position:0%
issue was the designation of local farm
 
05:29:27.830 --> 05:29:27.840 align:start position:0%
products it's not supplying the year the
 
05:29:30.708 --> 05:29:30.718 align:start position:0%
whole meal it's snacks and foods and it
 
05:29:30.718 --> 05:29:31.970 align:start position:0%
whole meal it's snacks and foods and it
also

05:29:31.970 --> 05:29:31.980 align:start position:0%
also
 
05:29:34.550 --> 05:29:34.560 align:start position:0%
clears up the definition of what a local
 
05:29:37.850 --> 05:29:37.860 align:start position:0%
Farm is by extending a range of miles
 
05:29:40.368 --> 05:29:40.378 align:start position:0%
and if I know this bill is enabling it
 
05:29:43.310 --> 05:29:43.320 align:start position:0%
legislation that allows schools to
 
05:29:46.868 --> 05:29:46.878 align:start position:0%
participate in a win win win
 
05:29:50.628 --> 05:29:50.638 align:start position:0%

community
 
05:29:54.530 --> 05:29:54.540 align:start position:0%
would I now vote green to support this
 
05:29:56.990 --> 05:29:57.000 align:start position:0%
great bill that will bring healthy foods
 
05:29:58.128 --> 05:29:58.138 align:start position:0%
to students
 
05:30:00.948 --> 05:30:00.958 align:start position:0%
will connect our students to where their
 
05:30:03.830 --> 05:30:03.840 align:start position:0%
food comes from in our local farms and
 
05:30:07.850 --> 05:30:07.860 align:start position:0%
support local Farm families thank you

committee on education to which was
 
05:35:23.628 --> 05:35:23.638 align:start position:0%
referred House Bill 626 FN requiring the
 
05:35:25.610 --> 05:35:25.620 align:start position:0%
Department of Education to administer
 
05:35:28.070 --> 05:35:28.080 align:start position:0%
the education Freedom account this comes
 
05:35:30.170 --> 05:35:30.180 align:start position:0%
without recommendation representative
 
05:35:32.930 --> 05:35:32.940 align:start position:0%
lunomu's Auto pass chair recognizes
 
05:35:38.690 --> 05:35:38.700 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:42.350 --> 05:35:42.360 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker honorable members
 
05:35:45.070 --> 05:35:45.080 align:start position:0%
this is a fairly simple bill in theory
 
05:35:47.750 --> 05:35:47.760 align:start position:0%
but the effects of it are difficult to
 
05:35:47.760 --> 05:35:49.250 align:start position:0%
but the effects of it are difficult to
overstate

05:35:49.250 --> 05:35:49.260 align:start position:0%
overstate
 
05:35:52.128 --> 05:35:52.138 align:start position:0%
so the the bill takes the education
 
05:35:53.570 --> 05:35:53.580 align:start position:0%
Freedom account
 
05:35:55.788 --> 05:35:55.798 align:start position:0%
and it transfers the administration of
 
05:35:57.288 --> 05:35:57.298 align:start position:0%
that account from where it currently
 
05:36:00.830 --> 05:36:00.840 align:start position:0%
lies in the private sector with a
 
05:36:03.410 --> 05:36:03.420 align:start position:0%
non-profit company that is going to be
 
05:36:04.910 --> 05:36:04.920 align:start position:0%
up for bid
 
05:36:07.250 --> 05:36:07.260 align:start position:0%
to the Department of Education and the
 
05:36:09.708 --> 05:36:09.718 align:start position:0%
executive branch
 
05:36:09.718 --> 05:36:11.390 align:start position:0%
executive branch
now

05:36:11.390 --> 05:36:11.400 align:start position:0%
now
 
05:36:13.190 --> 05:36:13.200 align:start position:0%
the first thing we should know is that
 
05:36:14.750 --> 05:36:14.760 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education as of right
 
05:36:17.570 --> 05:36:17.580 align:start position:0%
now it has no personnel and no
 
05:36:20.390 --> 05:36:20.400 align:start position:0%
infrastructure to support this change we
 
05:36:22.190 --> 05:36:22.200 align:start position:0%
were able to get this program up and
 
05:36:24.288 --> 05:36:24.298 align:start position:0%
running in record time Nationwide
 
05:36:27.350 --> 05:36:27.360 align:start position:0%
because we outsourced that to the
 
05:36:29.628 --> 05:36:29.638 align:start position:0%
private sector to get that done it's
 
05:36:31.670 --> 05:36:31.680 align:start position:0%
entirely possible that if we do this if
 
05:36:33.830 --> 05:36:33.840 align:start position:0%
we pass this bill and give it to the
 
05:36:35.690 --> 05:36:35.700 align:start position:0%
Department of Education we can
 
05:36:37.310 --> 05:36:37.320 align:start position:0%
experience a lapse we could experience
 
05:36:38.990 --> 05:36:39.000 align:start position:0%
difficulty in getting this funding out
 
05:36:44.448 --> 05:36:44.458 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:47.628 --> 05:36:47.638 align:start position:0%
here we have the cost of the program you
 
05:36:49.368 --> 05:36:49.378 align:start position:0%
may hear arguments that the cost is too
 
05:36:51.650 --> 05:36:51.660 align:start position:0%
high but according to our numbers we see
 
05:36:53.330 --> 05:36:53.340 align:start position:0%
that the administrative costs and the
 
05:36:55.430 --> 05:36:55.440 align:start position:0%
current program are running within the
 
05:36:58.430 --> 05:36:58.440 align:start position:0%
mean for the public education sector and
 
05:37:01.670 --> 05:37:01.680 align:start position:0%
that includes startup costs
 
05:37:04.788 --> 05:37:04.798 align:start position:0%
startup costs were quite expensive now
 
05:37:06.590 --> 05:37:06.600 align:start position:0%
that those costs are over we fully
 
05:37:08.270 --> 05:37:08.280 align:start position:0%
expect these costs to continue coming
 
05:37:10.190 --> 05:37:10.200 align:start position:0%
down over time
 
05:37:13.368 --> 05:37:13.378 align:start position:0%
that would not happen necessarily if we
 
05:37:15.948 --> 05:37:15.958 align:start position:0%
gave it to the Department of Education
 
05:37:17.930 --> 05:37:17.940 align:start position:0%
and I will also note that when we
 
05:37:20.330 --> 05:37:20.340 align:start position:0%
receive this bill in education there was
 
05:37:22.310 --> 05:37:22.320 align:start position:0%
no fiscal note with it it wasn't
 
05:37:25.970 --> 05:37:25.980 align:start position:0%
produced in time we have no idea what
 
05:37:28.670 --> 05:37:28.680 align:start position:0%
they are suggesting this would cost if
 
05:37:29.690 --> 05:37:29.700 align:start position:0%
we gave it to the Department of
 
05:37:29.700 --> 05:37:30.890 align:start position:0%
we gave it to the Department of
Education

05:37:30.890 --> 05:37:30.900 align:start position:0%
Education
 
05:37:32.810 --> 05:37:32.820 align:start position:0%
as I mentioned open bidding on this
 
05:37:34.250 --> 05:37:34.260 align:start position:0%
program should be coming up pretty soon
 
05:37:37.010 --> 05:37:37.020 align:start position:0%
the member will suspend
 
05:37:39.650 --> 05:37:39.660 align:start position:0%
if you need to have a conversation take
 
05:37:41.930 --> 05:37:41.940 align:start position:0%
it out into the Annie room the member
 
05:37:43.910 --> 05:37:43.920 align:start position:0%
has a right to be heard
 
05:37:46.490 --> 05:37:46.500 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
05:37:48.470 --> 05:37:48.480 align:start position:0%
you may also hear an argument that there
 
05:37:51.890 --> 05:37:51.900 align:start position:0%
is too much or doubled up Administration
 
05:37:54.350 --> 05:37:54.360 align:start position:0%
over this program I would note this bill
 
05:37:57.650 --> 05:37:57.660 align:start position:0%
does nothing to address any concerns
 
05:37:59.868 --> 05:37:59.878 align:start position:0%
about how much Administration is
 
05:38:01.430 --> 05:38:01.440 align:start position:0%
occurring in the program because all it
 
05:38:03.470 --> 05:38:03.480 align:start position:0%
would do it was is it would take it from
 
05:38:05.330 --> 05:38:05.340 align:start position:0%
the private sector and put it in the
 
05:38:07.670 --> 05:38:07.680 align:start position:0%
public sector that is not a reduction in
 
05:38:11.090 --> 05:38:11.100 align:start position:0%
administration by any means
 
05:38:14.510 --> 05:38:14.520 align:start position:0%
currently the program is transparent you
 
05:38:17.690 --> 05:38:17.700 align:start position:0%
can access the funding information on
 
05:38:19.970 --> 05:38:19.980 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:22.850 --> 05:38:22.860 align:start position:0%
and that is why I am asking you to
 
05:38:22.860 --> 05:38:23.930 align:start position:0%
and that is why I am asking you to
oppose

05:38:23.930 --> 05:38:23.940 align:start position:0%
oppose
 
05:38:26.090 --> 05:38:26.100 align:start position:0%
ought to pass on this bill and Mr
 
05:38:30.288 --> 05:38:30.298 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:37.970 --> 05:38:37.980 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:40.490 --> 05:38:40.500 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr Speaker House
 
05:38:43.070 --> 05:38:43.080 align:start position:0%
Bill 626 would require the New Hampshire
 
05:38:45.288 --> 05:38:45.298 align:start position:0%
Department of Education to administer
 
05:38:47.350 --> 05:38:47.360 align:start position:0%
the education Freedom account program
 
05:38:49.448 --> 05:38:49.458 align:start position:0%
that's right
 
05:38:52.550 --> 05:38:52.560 align:start position:0%
hb626 would have a department that's
 
05:38:56.090 --> 05:38:56.100 align:start position:0%
currently responsible for over 165
 
05:38:58.368 --> 05:38:58.378 align:start position:0%
000 New Hampshire students to administer
 
05:39:01.010 --> 05:39:01.020 align:start position:0%
a program that serves approximately 3
 
05:39:02.690 --> 05:39:02.700 align:start position:0%
200 students
 
05:39:04.970 --> 05:39:04.980 align:start position:0%
so what's the big deal
 
05:39:08.510 --> 05:39:08.520 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire the EFA program is not
 
05:39:10.250 --> 05:39:10.260 align:start position:0%
actually managed by the Department of
 
05:39:13.070 --> 05:39:13.080 align:start position:0%
Education as in other states with these
 
05:39:14.930 --> 05:39:14.940 align:start position:0%
School voucher programs
 
05:39:17.570 --> 05:39:17.580 align:start position:0%
it's managed by a private contractor
 
05:39:20.150 --> 05:39:20.160 align:start position:0%
this contractor skims 10 percent of our
 
05:39:23.030 --> 05:39:23.040 align:start position:0%
taxpayer dollars right off the top to
 
05:39:24.530 --> 05:39:24.540 align:start position:0%
keep for themselves
 
05:39:27.590 --> 05:39:27.600 align:start position:0%
and that needs to change
 
05:39:29.868 --> 05:39:29.878 align:start position:0%
but wait according to a conservative

activist organization quote the EFA
 
05:39:36.170 --> 05:39:36.180 align:start position:0%
program has been running efficiently end
 
05:39:39.770 --> 05:39:39.780 align:start position:0%
quote so let's look into that claim
 
05:39:42.890 --> 05:39:42.900 align:start position:0%
when the EFA program was created two
 
05:39:45.770 --> 05:39:45.780 align:start position:0%
years ago it did not get support from
 
05:39:48.350 --> 05:39:48.360 align:start position:0%
any legislative committee and was jammed
 
05:39:50.570 --> 05:39:50.580 align:start position:0%
into the state budget with an estimated
 
05:39:52.910 --> 05:39:52.920 align:start position:0%
cost of three million dollars
 
05:39:55.368 --> 05:39:55.378 align:start position:0%
but to date the program has cost New
 
05:39:58.010 --> 05:39:58.020 align:start position:0%
Hampshire taxpayers nearly 25 million
 
05:39:59.930 --> 05:39:59.940 align:start position:0%
dollars and the commissioner has
 
05:40:02.570 --> 05:40:02.580 align:start position:0%
requested another 60 million dollars for
 
05:40:04.788 --> 05:40:04.798 align:start position:0%
this over the next two years
 
05:40:07.070 --> 05:40:07.080 align:start position:0%
that doesn't sound conservative to me
 
05:40:09.590 --> 05:40:09.600 align:start position:0%
neither does the nine million dollars of
 
05:40:11.930 --> 05:40:11.940 align:start position:0%
that taxpayer money that the contractor
 
05:40:13.430 --> 05:40:13.440 align:start position:0%
gets to keep
 
05:40:15.708 --> 05:40:15.718 align:start position:0%
according to their website they have
 
05:40:17.930 --> 05:40:17.940 align:start position:0%
seven employees and a current and former
 
05:40:20.230 --> 05:40:20.240 align:start position:0%
legislator on their board efficient
 
05:40:23.448 --> 05:40:23.458 align:start position:0%
really I bet most of our constituents
 
05:40:26.090 --> 05:40:26.100 align:start position:0%
would call that something else
 
05:40:28.310 --> 05:40:28.320 align:start position:0%
that same conservative activist group
 
05:40:31.550 --> 05:40:31.560 align:start position:0%
also notes quote this bill would also
 
05:40:33.890 --> 05:40:33.900 align:start position:0%
restrict the near the yearly test
 
05:40:33.900 --> 05:40:35.868 align:start position:0%
restrict the near the yearly test
assessments

05:40:35.868 --> 05:40:35.878 align:start position:0%
assessments
 
05:40:38.330 --> 05:40:38.340 align:start position:0%
that families may choose from and
 
05:40:40.550 --> 05:40:40.560 align:start position:0%
require them to take a state
 
05:40:42.530 --> 05:40:42.540 align:start position:0%
standardized test
 
05:40:45.410 --> 05:40:45.420 align:start position:0%
and that's right taxpayers should know
 
05:40:47.390 --> 05:40:47.400 align:start position:0%
what they're getting for their precious
 
05:40:49.250 --> 05:40:49.260 align:start position:0%
tax dollars
 
05:40:51.530 --> 05:40:51.540 align:start position:0%
we're committed to improving the
 
05:40:53.510 --> 05:40:53.520 align:start position:0%
accountability oversight and
 
05:40:56.330 --> 05:40:56.340 align:start position:0%
transparency of the EFA program would
 
05:40:58.128 --> 05:40:58.138 align:start position:0%
the commissioner now asking for 60
 
05:41:00.708 --> 05:41:00.718 align:start position:0%
million more dollars of taxpayer money
 
05:41:03.050 --> 05:41:03.060 align:start position:0%
in the next budget it's more important
 
05:41:05.270 --> 05:41:05.280 align:start position:0%
than ever that taxpayers know how their
 
05:41:08.330 --> 05:41:08.340 align:start position:0%
money is being spent and the results
 
05:41:10.550 --> 05:41:10.560 align:start position:0%
support the motion of ought to pass to

Mr Speaker
 
05:43:52.670 --> 05:43:52.680 align:start position:0%
if I know that the current

administration of the education Freedom
 
05:43:59.270 --> 05:43:59.280 align:start position:0%

Education currently has neither the
 
05:44:10.788 --> 05:44:10.798 align:start position:0%
staff or the infrastructure to run an
 
05:44:13.970 --> 05:44:13.980 align:start position:0%
EFA program and finally if I believe
 
05:44:15.970 --> 05:44:15.980 align:start position:0%
that a private non-profit organization
 
05:44:18.170 --> 05:44:18.180 align:start position:0%

05:45:05.448 --> 05:45:05.458 align:start position:0%
the EFA voucher program will be five

to fix it more money to fix it but we
 
05:48:23.990 --> 05:48:24.000 align:start position:0%
don't know where it's going we don't
 
05:48:25.610 --> 05:48:25.620 align:start position:0%
know what it's being used for
 
05:48:28.128 --> 05:48:28.138 align:start position:0%
so yet again another program was started
 
05:48:29.270 --> 05:48:29.280 align:start position:0%
last year
 
05:48:32.930 --> 05:48:32.940 align:start position:0%
to send yet again more money to schools
 
05:48:35.270 --> 05:48:35.280 align:start position:0%
that have problems okay
 
05:48:37.010 --> 05:48:37.020 align:start position:0%
but we said
 
05:48:38.930 --> 05:48:38.940 align:start position:0%
when you do that
 
05:48:40.788 --> 05:48:40.798 align:start position:0%
we want to know we want you to have a
 
05:48:43.910 --> 05:48:43.920 align:start position:0%
plan what are you going to use it for
 
05:48:46.368 --> 05:48:46.378 align:start position:0%
and at the end of the time did it work
 
05:48:48.708 --> 05:48:48.718 align:start position:0%
that's all we asked for what are you
 
05:48:50.510 --> 05:48:50.520 align:start position:0%
going to use it for come up with a plan
 
05:48:52.670 --> 05:48:52.680 align:start position:0%
how is this going to work
 
05:48:55.368 --> 05:48:55.378 align:start position:0%
but now it's one year later and they're
 
05:48:56.570 --> 05:48:56.580 align:start position:0%
saying oh
 
05:48:59.510 --> 05:48:59.520 align:start position:0%
if it's 50 000 a small sum of money
 
05:49:01.970 --> 05:49:01.980 align:start position:0%
fifty thousand you don't have to do a
 
05:49:03.948 --> 05:49:03.958 align:start position:0%
report because too much money is spent
 
05:49:06.470 --> 05:49:06.480 align:start position:0%
in doing the report I ask you fifty
 
05:49:08.150 --> 05:49:08.160 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars and you can't write a
 
05:49:08.160 --> 05:49:09.410 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars and you can't write a
report

05:49:09.410 --> 05:49:09.420 align:start position:0%
report
 
05:49:11.090 --> 05:49:11.100 align:start position:0%
so at any rate
 
05:49:14.330 --> 05:49:14.340 align:start position:0%
I would urge you to vote no on this
 
05:49:17.390 --> 05:49:17.400 align:start position:0%
because let's
 
05:49:20.150 --> 05:49:20.160 align:start position:0%
let's hold people accountable let's hope
 
05:49:22.610 --> 05:49:22.620 align:start position:0%
that maybe the money just doesn't
 
05:49:24.948 --> 05:49:24.958 align:start position:0%
I don't actually know what because we
 
05:49:28.128 --> 05:49:28.138 align:start position:0%
never know what let's let's get a report
 
05:49:30.890 --> 05:49:30.900 align:start position:0%
let's find out let's make people put a
 
05:49:32.750 --> 05:49:32.760 align:start position:0%
plan in place before we give them more
 
05:49:36.350 --> 05:49:36.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:47.270 --> 05:49:47.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:49.610 --> 05:49:49.620 align:start position:0%
the extraordinary needs Grant is part of
 
05:49:52.128 --> 05:49:52.138 align:start position:0%
the education funding for schools
 
05:49:53.810 --> 05:49:53.820 align:start position:0%
and there's a grant that we put in place
 
05:49:56.030 --> 05:49:56.040 align:start position:0%
a year ago
 
05:49:58.610 --> 05:49:58.620 align:start position:0%
approximately 17 million dollars for for
 
05:50:01.010 --> 05:50:01.020 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:04.430 --> 05:50:04.440 align:start position:0%
this this uh process that we established
 
05:50:07.010 --> 05:50:07.020 align:start position:0%
was to assist those schools with that
 
05:50:08.930 --> 05:50:08.940 align:start position:0%
had these extraordinary needs and we
 
05:50:11.150 --> 05:50:11.160 align:start position:0%
rode into it the house wrote in an
 
05:50:13.310 --> 05:50:13.320 align:start position:0%
accountability plan you receive the
 
05:50:15.470 --> 05:50:15.480 align:start position:0%
money you write this accountability plan
 
05:50:17.930 --> 05:50:17.940 align:start position:0%
however when you distribute this money
 
05:50:20.090 --> 05:50:20.100 align:start position:0%
over all the schools
 
05:50:22.610 --> 05:50:22.620 align:start position:0%
some schools are receiving a thousand
 
05:50:22.620 --> 05:50:23.750 align:start position:0%
some schools are receiving a thousand
dollars

05:50:23.750 --> 05:50:23.760 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
05:50:26.810 --> 05:50:26.820 align:start position:0%
two thousand dollars very little amounts
 
05:50:29.150 --> 05:50:29.160 align:start position:0%
this bill was constructed and submitted
 
05:50:31.310 --> 05:50:31.320 align:start position:0%
To Us by the Department of Education in
 
05:50:34.250 --> 05:50:34.260 align:start position:0%
an effort to streamline this program and
 
05:50:36.230 --> 05:50:36.240 align:start position:0%
allow those districts which are very
 
05:50:40.250 --> 05:50:40.260 align:start position:0%
small schools like these k-3s k-4s to
 
05:50:42.288 --> 05:50:42.298 align:start position:0%
allow this to be unrestricted money to
 
05:50:44.448 --> 05:50:44.458 align:start position:0%
assist them as we do with all other
 
05:50:47.750 --> 05:50:47.760 align:start position:0%
aspects of the education formula so I
 
05:50:49.670 --> 05:50:49.680 align:start position:0%
would encourage you to support the
 
05:50:52.490 --> 05:50:52.500 align:start position:0%
department of education's request and
 
05:50:54.650 --> 05:50:54.660 align:start position:0%
send this bill on to the finance
 
05:50:56.448 --> 05:50:56.458 align:start position:0%
committee where we will be discussing
 
05:50:59.270 --> 05:50:59.280 align:start position:0%
all three of these areas be it the
 
05:51:01.610 --> 05:51:01.620 align:start position:0%
relief Grant be it extraordinary grants
 
05:51:04.970 --> 05:51:04.980 align:start position:0%
or be it the fiscal capacity all that as
 
05:51:06.110 --> 05:51:06.120 align:start position:0%
the governor mentioned this morning
 
05:51:08.990 --> 05:51:09.000 align:start position:0%
needs an overhaul so let's send this
 
05:51:11.510 --> 05:51:11.520 align:start position:0%
thing on as the Department's asking to
 
05:51:14.990 --> 05:51:15.000 align:start position:0%
the finance committee and resolve
 
05:51:17.690 --> 05:51:17.700 align:start position:0%
this whole process thank you
 
05:51:19.670 --> 05:51:19.680 align:start position:0%
the motion before us is the majority
 
05:51:22.788 --> 05:51:22.798 align:start position:0%
report about a pass and House Bill 638
 
05:51:25.190 --> 05:51:25.200 align:start position:0%
are you ready for the question all those
 
05:51:27.288 --> 05:51:27.298 align:start position:0%
in favor say aye
 
05:51:29.628 --> 05:51:29.638 align:start position:0%
those opposed nay
 
05:51:31.610 --> 05:51:31.620 align:start position:0%
the eyes have it
 
05:51:34.548 --> 05:51:34.558 align:start position:0%
and the committee report is adopted and
 
05:51:52.670 --> 05:51:52.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:54.590 --> 05:51:54.600 align:start position:0%
committee on Election law to which was
 
05:51:58.910 --> 05:51:58.920 align:start position:0%
referred House Bill 324 FNA relative to
 
05:52:00.770 --> 05:52:00.780 align:start position:0%
campaign contributions and expenditures
 
05:52:03.770 --> 05:52:03.780 align:start position:0%
into making appropriation therefore this
 
05:52:04.970 --> 05:52:04.980 align:start position:0%
bill is
 
05:52:06.970 --> 05:52:06.980 align:start position:0%
been sent to us without recommendation
 
05:52:10.190 --> 05:52:10.200 align:start position:0%
Senator Muirhead moves ought to pass
 
05:52:23.090 --> 05:52:23.100 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:23.100 --> 05:52:24.288 align:start position:0%
 
Union

05:52:24.288 --> 05:52:24.298 align:start position:0%
Union
 
05:52:27.410 --> 05:52:27.420 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker I rise today to
 
05:52:30.830 --> 05:52:30.840 align:start position:0%
oppose the ox path motion on HB 324 HP
 
05:52:33.830 --> 05:52:33.840 align:start position:0%
324 is a six million dollar expenditure
 
05:52:36.530 --> 05:52:36.540 align:start position:0%
which it does in its attempt to get
 
05:52:38.510 --> 05:52:38.520 align:start position:0%
money out of politics it takes money out
 
05:52:40.970 --> 05:52:40.980 align:start position:0%
of the taxpayers wallets and then puts
 
05:52:43.610 --> 05:52:43.620 align:start position:0%
more money into politics it will not
 
05:52:45.590 --> 05:52:45.600 align:start position:0%
accomplish the things that it claims to
 
05:52:48.470 --> 05:52:48.480 align:start position:0%
do it will end up it is colloquially
 
05:52:50.208 --> 05:52:50.218 align:start position:0%
known in other states where it has been
 
05:52:52.128 --> 05:52:52.138 align:start position:0%
put in as the political operative
 
05:52:54.530 --> 05:52:54.540 align:start position:0%
bailout fund because what it does is it
 
05:52:56.990 --> 05:52:57.000 align:start position:0%
takes your tax dollars and gives it to a
 
05:52:58.430 --> 05:52:58.440 align:start position:0%
campaign that would not otherwise be
 
05:53:01.128 --> 05:53:01.138 align:start position:0%
able to raise them finally this law
 
05:53:03.890 --> 05:53:03.900 align:start position:0%
violates the Constitution because in the
 
05:53:05.330 --> 05:53:05.340 align:start position:0%
Constitution you have this thing called
 
05:53:08.150 --> 05:53:08.160 align:start position:0%
right to freedom of Association so when
 
05:53:10.430 --> 05:53:10.440 align:start position:0%
the government takes your money and then
 
05:53:12.410 --> 05:53:12.420 align:start position:0%
gives it to a candidate that you don't
 
05:53:15.110 --> 05:53:15.120 align:start position:0%
support that violates your freedom of
 
05:53:18.110 --> 05:53:18.120 align:start position:0%
Association and your freedom of speech
 
05:53:19.910 --> 05:53:19.920 align:start position:0%
we do need to work on our campaign
 
05:53:21.410 --> 05:53:21.420 align:start position:0%
Finance laws we just passed
 
05:53:23.030 --> 05:53:23.040 align:start position:0%
comprehensive campaign Finance reform
 
05:53:24.910 --> 05:53:24.920 align:start position:0%
but this is a six million dollar
 
05:53:27.650 --> 05:53:27.660 align:start position:0%
taxpayer-funded boondoggle and I asked
 
05:53:30.708 --> 05:53:30.718 align:start position:0%
the body to reject it
 
05:53:32.810 --> 05:53:32.820 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes recognizes
 
05:53:37.788 --> 05:53:37.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:41.810 --> 05:53:41.820 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:46.490 --> 05:53:46.500 align:start position:0%
before any candidate faces voters
 
05:53:49.010 --> 05:53:49.020 align:start position:0%
the candidates especially for Statewide
 
05:53:51.708 --> 05:53:51.718 align:start position:0%
offices have to succeed in a different
 
05:53:53.628 --> 05:53:53.638 align:start position:0%
primary they have to succeed in the
 
05:53:57.048 --> 05:53:57.058 align:start position:0%
donor primary they have to appeal to
 
05:54:00.350 --> 05:54:00.360 align:start position:0%
out-of-state donor Elites if they're
 
05:54:04.010 --> 05:54:04.020 align:start position:0%
going to run a viable campaign
 
05:54:06.110 --> 05:54:06.120 align:start position:0%
they appeal to people who don't
 
05:54:07.670 --> 05:54:07.680 align:start position:0%
understand New Hampshire don't live in
 
05:54:09.288 --> 05:54:09.298 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and are committed to New
 
05:54:09.298 --> 05:54:10.190 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and are committed to New
Hampshire

05:54:10.190 --> 05:54:10.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
05:54:12.048 --> 05:54:12.058 align:start position:0%
I was just talking to a campaign
 
05:54:13.490 --> 05:54:13.500 align:start position:0%
strategist about
 
05:54:15.170 --> 05:54:15.180 align:start position:0%
candidates who might run in the next
 
05:54:17.868 --> 05:54:17.878 align:start position:0%
gubernatorial cycle and the strategist
 
05:54:21.110 --> 05:54:21.120 align:start position:0%
told me that candidates have to pass the
 
05:54:22.670 --> 05:54:22.680 align:start position:0%
Rolodex test
 
05:54:26.330 --> 05:54:26.340 align:start position:0%
which in which they uh they are grilled
 
05:54:29.690 --> 05:54:29.700 align:start position:0%
about how many big donors they know and
 
05:54:32.810 --> 05:54:32.820 align:start position:0%
how much money they can raise out of
 
05:54:32.820 --> 05:54:33.948 align:start position:0%
how much money they can raise out of
state

05:54:33.948 --> 05:54:33.958 align:start position:0%
state
 
05:54:37.490 --> 05:54:37.500 align:start position:0%
this bill seeks to disempower the
 
05:54:40.310 --> 05:54:40.320 align:start position:0%
out-of-state Elite donor class and
 
05:54:43.070 --> 05:54:43.080 align:start position:0%
re-empower New Hampshire voters
 
05:54:46.610 --> 05:54:46.620 align:start position:0%
and it does it in a very simple way it
 
05:54:50.208 --> 05:54:50.218 align:start position:0%
gives every voter for 25 certificates
 
05:54:52.850 --> 05:54:52.860 align:start position:0%
that they can give to any candidate for
 
05:54:55.128 --> 05:54:55.138 align:start position:0%
executive counselor governor of their
 
05:54:55.138 --> 05:54:56.208 align:start position:0%
executive counselor governor of their
choice

05:54:56.208 --> 05:54:56.218 align:start position:0%
choice
 
05:55:01.368 --> 05:55:01.378 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:04.310 --> 05:55:04.320 align:start position:0%
and gives candidates with real support
 
05:55:07.190 --> 05:55:07.200 align:start position:0%
in the population a chance to run a
 
05:55:08.628 --> 05:55:08.638 align:start position:0%
viable campaign
 
05:55:12.288 --> 05:55:12.298 align:start position:0%
my friend and colleague from the great
 
05:55:15.708 --> 05:55:15.718 align:start position:0%
city of Manchester just said that a bill
 
05:55:18.170 --> 05:55:18.180 align:start position:0%
such as this would Empower candidates
 
05:55:20.570 --> 05:55:20.580 align:start position:0%
who are weak but that's not true because
 
05:55:23.990 --> 05:55:24.000 align:start position:0%
in order to qualify for donor for for
 
05:55:28.250 --> 05:55:28.260 align:start position:0%
voter dollars candidates have to collect
 
05:55:29.990 --> 05:55:30.000 align:start position:0%
large numbers of very small donations
 
05:55:32.090 --> 05:55:32.100 align:start position:0%
for an executive counselor would have to
 
05:55:34.490 --> 05:55:34.500 align:start position:0%
collect 500 donations of at least five
 
05:55:36.890 --> 05:55:36.900 align:start position:0%
dollars to qualify you can't do that
 
05:55:40.070 --> 05:55:40.080 align:start position:0%
unless people in your District know you
 
05:55:41.868 --> 05:55:41.878 align:start position:0%
people in your District appreciate you
 
05:55:43.190 --> 05:55:43.200 align:start position:0%
people in your District want you to run
 
05:55:44.570 --> 05:55:44.580 align:start position:0%
gubernator trail candidates that have to
 
05:55:48.708 --> 05:55:48.718 align:start position:0%
collect 2500 five dollar donations that
 
05:55:51.590 --> 05:55:51.600 align:start position:0%
shows real local support
 
05:55:53.510 --> 05:55:53.520 align:start position:0%
my friend and colleague suggest that a
 
05:55:55.310 --> 05:55:55.320 align:start position:0%
bill like this might be unconstitutional
 
05:55:57.770 --> 05:55:57.780 align:start position:0%
but in fact plants like this have been
 
05:56:00.230 --> 05:56:00.240 align:start position:0%
tested and work we have public financing
 
05:56:02.208 --> 05:56:02.218 align:start position:0%
of campaigns in Maine we have public
 
05:56:04.190 --> 05:56:04.200 align:start position:0%
financing campaigns in Washington they
 
05:56:05.570 --> 05:56:05.580 align:start position:0%
haven't been declared unconstitutional
 
05:56:07.368 --> 05:56:07.378 align:start position:0%
we have a presidential campaign election
 
05:56:08.990 --> 05:56:09.000 align:start position:0%
fund that you might notice when you're
 
05:56:11.510 --> 05:56:11.520 align:start position:0%
filling out your 1040 over the next
 
05:56:13.250 --> 05:56:13.260 align:start position:0%
month or two if there's a check box you
 
05:56:15.530 --> 05:56:15.540 align:start position:0%
can give three dollars to the fund these
 
05:56:16.430 --> 05:56:16.440 align:start position:0%
are not considered to be
 
05:56:18.110 --> 05:56:18.120 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional and this one won't be
 
05:56:18.120 --> 05:56:20.510 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional and this one won't be
either

05:56:20.510 --> 05:56:20.520 align:start position:0%
either
 
05:56:20.520 --> 05:56:23.390 align:start position:0%
either
foreign

05:56:23.390 --> 05:56:23.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:26.750 --> 05:56:26.760 align:start position:0%
this idea was formed in a bipartisan
 
05:56:28.490 --> 05:56:28.500 align:start position:0%
study committee
 
05:56:30.230 --> 05:56:30.240 align:start position:0%
and it was introduced in an earlier
 
05:56:33.470 --> 05:56:33.480 align:start position:0%
version a couple sessions ago this
 
05:56:35.270 --> 05:56:35.280 align:start position:0%
particular bill has been refined and
 
05:56:38.090 --> 05:56:38.100 align:start position:0%
revised in light of criticisms and
 
05:56:40.490 --> 05:56:40.500 align:start position:0%
suggestions that have come from members
 
05:56:43.368 --> 05:56:43.378 align:start position:0%
of both parties including former chairs
 
05:56:47.510 --> 05:56:47.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:50.570 --> 05:56:50.580 align:start position:0%
this particular bill would not cost six
 
05:56:52.548 --> 05:56:52.558 align:start position:0%
million dollars this bill would allocate
 
05:56:55.368 --> 05:56:55.378 align:start position:0%
one dollar this bill creates a legal
 
05:56:57.590 --> 05:56:57.600 align:start position:0%
framework for this plan
 
05:57:00.230 --> 05:57:00.240 align:start position:0%
we would need to persuade each other and
 
05:57:02.330 --> 05:57:02.340 align:start position:0%
explain the plan sufficiently to
 
05:57:05.090 --> 05:57:05.100 align:start position:0%
Citizens and at a further date allocate
 
05:57:07.490 --> 05:57:07.500 align:start position:0%
funding for it for it to become fully
 
05:57:09.708 --> 05:57:09.718 align:start position:0%
active so this creates a legal framework
 
05:57:12.650 --> 05:57:12.660 align:start position:0%
not a cost now I have estimated what
 
05:57:14.990 --> 05:57:15.000 align:start position:0%
this bill if it were fully utilized by
 
05:57:16.670 --> 05:57:16.680 align:start position:0%
every candidate in both parties for
 
05:57:19.030 --> 05:57:19.040 align:start position:0%
executive Council and Governor Mike cost
 
05:57:21.830 --> 05:57:21.840 align:start position:0%
and the Six Million Dollar estimate is
 
05:57:23.448 --> 05:57:23.458 align:start position:0%
accurate it's about eight dollars per
 
05:57:25.730 --> 05:57:25.740 align:start position:0%
voter per election cycle
 
05:57:25.740 --> 05:57:27.230 align:start position:0%
voter per election cycle
and

05:57:27.230 --> 05:57:27.240 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:57:29.330 --> 05:57:29.340 align:start position:0%
that's what it would cost for a system
 
05:57:32.330 --> 05:57:32.340 align:start position:0%
of clean elections I wouldn't be
 
05:57:34.788 --> 05:57:34.798 align:start position:0%
donating to candidates I don't support I
 
05:57:38.690 --> 05:57:38.700 align:start position:0%
would be funding a clean election system
 
05:57:41.208 --> 05:57:41.218 align:start position:0%
that's what it would cost to restore
 
05:57:43.850 --> 05:57:43.860 align:start position:0%
voter confidence in our elections and
 
05:57:45.170 --> 05:57:45.180 align:start position:0%
for that reason
 
05:57:47.270 --> 05:57:47.280 align:start position:0%

06:13:40.430 --> 06:13:40.440 align:start position:0%
and if I also know that doing so would
 
06:13:40.440 --> 06:13:42.110 align:start position:0%
and if I also know that doing so would
eliminate

06:13:42.110 --> 06:13:42.120 align:start position:0%
eliminate
 
06:13:44.330 --> 06:13:44.340 align:start position:0%
a logical
 
06:13:46.490 --> 06:13:46.500 align:start position:0%
idea that was put into statutes

06:16:51.830 --> 06:16:51.840 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
06:16:54.048 --> 06:16:54.058 align:start position:0%
um HB 502
 
06:16:57.650 --> 06:16:57.660 align:start position:0%
would would return New Hampshire to a
 
06:16:59.868 --> 06:16:59.878 align:start position:0%
series of Lawless elections
 
06:17:03.350 --> 06:17:03.360 align:start position:0%
so let me explain to you what we what
 
06:17:05.208 --> 06:17:05.218 align:start position:0%
you would be voting for if you vote for
 
06:17:08.510 --> 06:17:08.520 align:start position:0%
HP hb502
 
06:17:11.208 --> 06:17:11.218 align:start position:0%
you would be voting so that any person
 
06:17:16.070 --> 06:17:16.080 align:start position:0%
can walk into any polling location
 
06:17:18.530 --> 06:17:18.540 align:start position:0%
register to vote while presenting
 
06:17:21.890 --> 06:17:21.900 align:start position:0%
literally nothing not a driver's license
 
06:17:25.970 --> 06:17:25.980 align:start position:0%
not a student ID not a bill not a text
 
06:17:28.430 --> 06:17:28.440 align:start position:0%
message nothing
 
06:17:30.830 --> 06:17:30.840 align:start position:0%
they can go they are then handed a
 
06:17:34.010 --> 06:17:34.020 align:start position:0%
ballot not a affidavit ballot they are
 
06:17:36.770 --> 06:17:36.780 align:start position:0%
handed a full ballot that then goes into
 
06:17:39.830 --> 06:17:39.840 align:start position:0%
the box but wait it actually does more
 
06:17:41.868 --> 06:17:41.878 align:start position:0%
because it doesn't just repeal affidavit
 
06:17:43.430 --> 06:17:43.440 align:start position:0%
ballots it actually walks us back
 
06:17:46.788 --> 06:17:46.798 align:start position:0%
farther and restores the religious uh
 
06:17:50.090 --> 06:17:50.100 align:start position:0%
picture affidavit which not a single
 
06:17:52.430 --> 06:17:52.440 align:start position:0%
person the people who opposed it when we
 
06:17:54.170 --> 06:17:54.180 align:start position:0%
repealed this last year they weren't
 
06:17:56.390 --> 06:17:56.400 align:start position:0%
able to find a single person with
 
06:17:59.570 --> 06:17:59.580 align:start position:0%
standing to sue over it that would mean
 
06:18:01.548 --> 06:18:01.558 align:start position:0%
that somebody can walk into the polling
 
06:18:04.850 --> 06:18:04.860 align:start position:0%
location present nothing not even have
 
06:18:07.368 --> 06:18:07.378 align:start position:0%
their picture taken and they are handed
 
06:18:09.110 --> 06:18:09.120 align:start position:0%
a ballot
 
06:18:12.948 --> 06:18:12.958 align:start position:0%
it's ridiculous it what it does is it
 
06:18:15.288 --> 06:18:15.298 align:start position:0%
breeds a lack of faith into our
 
06:18:17.990 --> 06:18:18.000 align:start position:0%
elections when people do not believe in
 
06:18:21.170 --> 06:18:21.180 align:start position:0%
the process they don't vote
 
06:18:22.610 --> 06:18:22.620 align:start position:0%
they are going to get up here and
 
06:18:23.690 --> 06:18:23.700 align:start position:0%
they're going to tell you this is about
 
06:18:26.030 --> 06:18:26.040 align:start position:0%
people showing up without ID this is
 
06:18:28.548 --> 06:18:28.558 align:start position:0%
about people who are not on the poll not
 
06:18:30.590 --> 06:18:30.600 align:start position:0%
on they are not registered to vote so if
 
06:18:32.150 --> 06:18:32.160 align:start position:0%
you forget your ID and you're registered
 
06:18:34.128 --> 06:18:34.138 align:start position:0%
to vote in your town this doesn't affect
 
06:18:36.770 --> 06:18:36.780 align:start position:0%
you you can still vote everything's fine
 
06:18:39.650 --> 06:18:39.660 align:start position:0%
this is about people showing up to the
 
06:18:41.810 --> 06:18:41.820 align:start position:0%
polls on Election Day who are not
 
06:18:44.030 --> 06:18:44.040 align:start position:0%
registered to vote and not presenting
 
06:18:46.850 --> 06:18:46.860 align:start position:0%
anything about who they are or where
 
06:18:48.110 --> 06:18:48.120 align:start position:0%
they live
 
06:18:50.810 --> 06:18:50.820 align:start position:0%
voter ID and this isn't even voter ID
 
06:18:52.730 --> 06:18:52.740 align:start position:0%
this is showing something when you're
 
06:18:56.448 --> 06:18:56.458 align:start position:0%
registering voter ID is overwhelmingly
 
06:18:58.730 --> 06:18:58.740 align:start position:0%
popular and it's not just overwhelmingly
 
06:19:00.650 --> 06:19:00.660 align:start position:0%
popular with Republicans it's
 
06:19:03.350 --> 06:19:03.360 align:start position:0%
overwhelmingly popular with Democrats in
 
06:19:05.330 --> 06:19:05.340 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire there's been two polls
 
06:19:07.730 --> 06:19:07.740 align:start position:0%
conducted about this and both times a
 
06:19:10.430 --> 06:19:10.440 align:start position:0%
majority of Democrats polled supported
 
06:19:13.430 --> 06:19:13.440 align:start position:0%
showing an ID at the polls stand with
 
06:19:16.128 --> 06:19:16.138 align:start position:0%
your voters and vote against the ought
 
06:19:18.590 --> 06:19:18.600 align:start position:0%
to pass motion
 
06:19:25.690 --> 06:19:25.700 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:28.850 --> 06:19:28.860 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker I Rise to speak for
 
06:19:33.048 --> 06:19:33.058 align:start position:0%
the passage of hb502 the bill will
 
06:19:36.170 --> 06:19:36.180 align:start position:0%
repeal what we voted into law last year
 
06:19:41.330 --> 06:19:41.340 align:start position:0%
RSA 659 colon 23A which was passed along
 
06:19:45.010 --> 06:19:45.020 align:start position:0%
party lines by this house an established
 
06:19:47.990 --> 06:19:48.000 align:start position:0%
affidavit voting balloting also known as
 
06:19:51.590 --> 06:19:51.600 align:start position:0%
provisional or challenge ballots it was
 
06:19:53.990 --> 06:19:54.000 align:start position:0%
passed in the name of election Integrity
 
06:19:56.930 --> 06:19:56.940 align:start position:0%
as we just heard without pointing to any
 
06:20:00.110 --> 06:20:00.120 align:start position:0%
evidence of abuse of the election system
 
06:20:02.868 --> 06:20:02.878 align:start position:0%
and without review the house will be in
 
06:20:02.878 --> 06:20:04.368 align:start position:0%
and without review the house will be in
order

06:20:04.368 --> 06:20:04.378 align:start position:0%
order
 
06:20:06.770 --> 06:20:06.780 align:start position:0%
and without the review of the New
 
06:20:09.048 --> 06:20:09.058 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Supreme Court or the
 
06:20:11.930 --> 06:20:11.940 align:start position:0%
attorney's General's office as requested
 
06:20:14.090 --> 06:20:14.100 align:start position:0%
by the minority party
 
06:20:17.270 --> 06:20:17.280 align:start position:0%
the existing law effectively removes the
 
06:20:19.548 --> 06:20:19.558 align:start position:0%
ability of a voter without photo
 
06:20:23.390 --> 06:20:23.400 align:start position:0%
identification to sign an affidavit at
 
06:20:26.208 --> 06:20:26.218 align:start position:0%
the voting Place swearing to the voter's
 
06:20:29.570 --> 06:20:29.580 align:start position:0%
address and identity owners voters
 
06:20:29.580 --> 06:20:30.650 align:start position:0%
address and identity owners voters
without

06:20:30.650 --> 06:20:30.660 align:start position:0%
without
 
06:20:33.948 --> 06:20:33.958 align:start position:0%
photo IDs must return the packet that
 
06:20:36.288 --> 06:20:36.298 align:start position:0%
they are given and a copy of any
 
06:20:38.990 --> 06:20:39.000 align:start position:0%
required documentation to the Secretary
 
06:20:41.510 --> 06:20:41.520 align:start position:0%
of State's office and the provided
 
06:20:45.470 --> 06:20:45.480 align:start position:0%
Prepaid U.S postal envelope within seven
 
06:20:48.410 --> 06:20:48.420 align:start position:0%
days of the election in order for their
 
06:20:50.270 --> 06:20:50.280 align:start position:0%
ballot to be certified
 
06:20:53.750 --> 06:20:53.760 align:start position:0%
their votes may not count due to the
 
06:20:56.930 --> 06:20:56.940 align:start position:0%
slowness of the U.S Postal Service or
 
06:20:59.750 --> 06:20:59.760 align:start position:0%
the inability to retrieve the necessary
 
06:21:03.110 --> 06:21:03.120 align:start position:0%
documents by the deadline this bill will
 
06:21:06.230 --> 06:21:06.240 align:start position:0%
return the law to its status prior to
 
06:21:10.730 --> 06:21:10.740 align:start position:0%
the enactment of sb4 18 last year
 
06:21:13.310 --> 06:21:13.320 align:start position:0%
in addition to being a thinly veiled
 
06:21:16.190 --> 06:21:16.200 align:start position:0%
voter suppression effort our existing
 
06:21:18.590 --> 06:21:18.600 align:start position:0%
law is riddled
 
06:21:23.330 --> 06:21:23.340 align:start position:0%
is riddled with serious flaws first
 
06:21:25.730 --> 06:21:25.740 align:start position:0%
whether it violates the New Hampshire
 
06:21:30.048 --> 06:21:30.058 align:start position:0%
Constitution part 2 article 32 by adding
 
06:21:33.170 --> 06:21:33.180 align:start position:0%
or subtracting votes after the tally is
 
06:21:35.990 --> 06:21:36.000 align:start position:0%
made by the moderator on Election night
 
06:21:39.230 --> 06:21:39.240 align:start position:0%
under existing law affidavit ballots
 
06:21:42.230 --> 06:21:42.240 align:start position:0%
cannot be finely counted or reported
 
06:21:45.128 --> 06:21:45.138 align:start position:0%
until 10 days after the election day
 
06:21:47.690 --> 06:21:47.700 align:start position:0%
provisional accounting as many as tens
 
06:21:50.230 --> 06:21:50.240 align:start position:0%
of thousands of ballots on election day
 
06:21:53.510 --> 06:21:53.520 align:start position:0%
just to subtract them
 
06:21:56.448 --> 06:21:56.458 align:start position:0%
ten days later does not satisfy the
 
06:21:59.110 --> 06:21:59.120 align:start position:0%
requirement of the ballots are counted
 
06:22:01.970 --> 06:22:01.980 align:start position:0%
in the same meeting or the same day as
 
06:22:04.208 --> 06:22:04.218 align:start position:0%
the election they are therefore
 
06:22:07.490 --> 06:22:07.500 align:start position:0%
inconsistent with part two article 32's
 
06:22:10.250 --> 06:22:10.260 align:start position:0%
mandate that all ballots be counted on
 
06:22:12.948 --> 06:22:12.958 align:start position:0%
the day that they are cast this is
 
06:22:15.530 --> 06:22:15.540 align:start position:0%
currently in court being contested on
 
06:22:18.650 --> 06:22:18.660 align:start position:0%
this point the law may also violate the
 
06:22:20.930 --> 06:22:20.940 align:start position:0%
state's newest constitutional provision
 
06:22:24.708 --> 06:22:24.718 align:start position:0%
part 2 article 2B which says an
 
06:22:27.590 --> 06:22:27.600 align:start position:0%
individual's right to live free from
 
06:22:31.670 --> 06:22:31.680 align:start position:0%
governmental intrusion in private or
 
06:22:34.390 --> 06:22:34.400 align:start position:0%
personal information is natural
 
06:22:37.610 --> 06:22:37.620 align:start position:0%
essential and inherent provisional
 
06:22:41.208 --> 06:22:41.218 align:start position:0%
ballots are not secret they are assigned
 
06:22:44.448 --> 06:22:44.458 align:start position:0%
a number linking them to the voter the
 
06:22:46.670 --> 06:22:46.680 align:start position:0%
moderator and other voting officials
 
06:22:49.610 --> 06:22:49.620 align:start position:0%
will be able to see the provisional

06:22:57.890 --> 06:22:57.900 align:start position:0%
and our right to privacy
 
06:23:01.010 --> 06:23:01.020 align:start position:0%
the time frames in the existing law make
 
06:23:03.530 --> 06:23:03.540 align:start position:0%
it extremely difficult and probably in
 
06:23:06.830 --> 06:23:06.840 align:start position:0%
some cases impossible to comply with
 
06:23:09.590 --> 06:23:09.600 align:start position:0%
What's called the uniformed and overseas
 
06:23:13.128 --> 06:23:13.138 align:start position:0%
citizens absentee voting ballot called
 
06:23:16.368 --> 06:23:16.378 align:start position:0%
you okava which requires ballots to be
 
06:23:18.530 --> 06:23:18.540 align:start position:0%
mailed to service members and their
 
06:23:22.430 --> 06:23:22.440 align:start position:0%
families 45 days prior to the election
 
06:23:25.390 --> 06:23:25.400 align:start position:0%
because our state primary is so late
 
06:23:29.448 --> 06:23:29.458 align:start position:0%
this year there's 56 days before the
 
06:23:31.368 --> 06:23:31.378 align:start position:0%
general election between the primary and
 
06:23:34.190 --> 06:23:34.200 align:start position:0%
the general election the secretaries of
 
06:23:37.310 --> 06:23:37.320 align:start position:0%
State's office already has a type time
 
06:23:40.490 --> 06:23:40.500 align:start position:0%
tight timeline to comply with the
 
06:23:40.500 --> 06:23:41.448 align:start position:0%
tight timeline to comply with the
statute

06:23:41.448 --> 06:23:41.458 align:start position:0%
statute
 
06:23:43.850 --> 06:23:43.860 align:start position:0%
the new law that we enacted last year
 
06:23:46.670 --> 06:23:46.680 align:start position:0%
makes compliance even more difficult for
 
06:23:49.010 --> 06:23:49.020 align:start position:0%
the Secretary of State because the
 
06:23:52.190 --> 06:23:52.200 align:start position:0%
election totals will be recalculated 10
 
06:23:55.070 --> 06:23:55.080 align:start position:0%
to 14 days after the primary with
 
06:23:57.590 --> 06:23:57.600 align:start position:0%
potential new winners announced one day
 
06:24:00.948 --> 06:24:00.958 align:start position:0%
before the yukava deadline for valid for
 
06:24:03.948 --> 06:24:03.958 align:start position:0%
ballots to be formatted printed and sent
 
06:24:06.948 --> 06:24:06.958 align:start position:0%
and if a recount is permitted and
 
06:24:10.250 --> 06:24:10.260 align:start position:0%
requested final primary members will not
 
06:24:12.948 --> 06:24:12.958 align:start position:0%
be known in time to meet the 45-day
 
06:24:12.958 --> 06:24:15.350 align:start position:0%

deadline
 
06:24:19.610 --> 06:24:19.620 align:start position:0%
finally RSA the existing law also
 
06:24:24.590 --> 06:24:24.600 align:start position:0%
conflicts with RSA 65616 which provides
 
06:24:27.048 --> 06:24:27.058 align:start position:0%
that there shall be no impression or
 
06:24:29.628 --> 06:24:29.638 align:start position:0%
Mark to distinguish one general election
 
06:24:31.670 --> 06:24:31.680 align:start position:0%
ballot from another
 
06:24:35.570 --> 06:24:35.580 align:start position:0%
the affidavit is marked by the moderator
 
06:24:38.570 --> 06:24:38.580 align:start position:0%
in some the law we passed last year
 
06:24:41.650 --> 06:24:41.660 align:start position:0%
imposes unnecessary burdens on Election
 
06:24:44.690 --> 06:24:44.700 align:start position:0%
administrators and voters it does not
 
06:24:47.270 --> 06:24:47.280 align:start position:0%
comply with the Constitution and it
 
06:24:49.610 --> 06:24:49.620 align:start position:0%
flies in the face of Governor sununu's
 
06:24:51.590 --> 06:24:51.600 align:start position:0%
statements confirming the safety and
 
06:24:53.690 --> 06:24:53.700 align:start position:0%
reliability of New Hampshire elections
 
06:24:56.390 --> 06:24:56.400 align:start position:0%
as well as the findings of the Secretary
 
06:24:58.970 --> 06:24:58.980 align:start position:0%
of State's special committee on voter
 
06:25:01.430 --> 06:25:01.440 align:start position:0%
confidence it does not comply with
 
06:25:04.070 --> 06:25:04.080 align:start position:0%
federal law and endangers the right of

06:25:12.590 --> 06:25:12.600 align:start position:0%
reasons I urge the members of this house

walk into New Hampshire polling station
 
06:27:46.250 --> 06:27:46.260 align:start position:0%
on election day to register for the

identification
 
06:27:55.250 --> 06:27:55.260 align:start position:0%
and if I know
 
06:27:58.070 --> 06:27:58.080 align:start position:0%
that we have an obligation to our public
 
06:28:01.610 --> 06:28:01.620 align:start position:0%
our voters our constituents to ensure
 
06:28:04.610 --> 06:28:04.620 align:start position:0%
that not only do all qualified voters
 
06:28:06.530 --> 06:28:06.540 align:start position:0%
have the opportunity to cast a ballot
 
06:28:09.288 --> 06:28:09.298 align:start position:0%
but that also only qualified voters have
 
06:28:11.628 --> 06:28:11.638 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to cast a ballot
 
06:28:14.270 --> 06:28:14.280 align:start position:0%
and if I know that this bill if passed
 
06:28:16.788 --> 06:28:16.798 align:start position:0%
would leave us with no way to know how
 
06:28:20.150 --> 06:28:20.160 align:start position:0%
many of our voters were qualified
 
06:28:23.750 --> 06:28:23.760 align:start position:0%
and in addition if I know that this the
 
06:28:26.510 --> 06:28:26.520 align:start position:0%
current law applies only to those who
 
06:28:28.250 --> 06:28:28.260 align:start position:0%
show up to a polling station to register
 
06:28:30.770 --> 06:28:30.780 align:start position:0%

06:28:31.788 --> 06:28:31.798 align:start position:0%
no ID
 
06:28:35.030 --> 06:28:35.040 align:start position:0%
and I know that it has been testified in
 
06:28:39.470 --> 06:28:39.480 align:start position:0%
committee when SB 418 was in the process
 
06:28:42.530 --> 06:28:42.540 align:start position:0%
of passing SP 418 that there is more
 
06:28:45.730 --> 06:28:45.740 align:start position:0%

New Hampshire is a state of many
 
06:34:54.410 --> 06:34:54.420 align:start position:0%
elections everyone in this building has
 
06:34:56.810 --> 06:34:56.820 align:start position:0%
to run every two years we have town
 
06:34:59.448 --> 06:34:59.458 align:start position:0%
meeting annually and as all of you who
 
06:35:01.250 --> 06:35:01.260 align:start position:0%
have been in Rochester over these last
 
06:35:03.410 --> 06:35:03.420 align:start position:0%
few weeks know very well we have special
 
06:35:05.628 --> 06:35:05.638 align:start position:0%
elections and you can bet on it almost
 
06:35:08.990 --> 06:35:09.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:35:10.788 --> 06:35:10.798 align:start position:0%
tens of thousands of Voters in these
 
06:35:13.190 --> 06:35:13.200 align:start position:0%
elections vote absentee every time as
 
06:35:14.810 --> 06:35:14.820 align:start position:0%
the Secretary of State Illustrated in
 
06:35:16.970 --> 06:35:16.980 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note to this legislation an
 
06:35:18.948 --> 06:35:18.958 align:start position:0%
absentee voting has been a practice
 
06:35:21.530 --> 06:35:21.540 align:start position:0%
since the Civil War going back to when
 
06:35:23.690 --> 06:35:23.700 align:start position:0%
soldiers needed to
 
06:35:25.910 --> 06:35:25.920 align:start position:0%
practice their civil duties their civic
 
06:35:28.310 --> 06:35:28.320 align:start position:0%
duty on the battlefield while protecting
 
06:35:30.048 --> 06:35:30.058 align:start position:0%
and defending this country the country
 
06:35:32.868 --> 06:35:32.878 align:start position:0%
which gave them that civic duty
 
06:35:35.510 --> 06:35:35.520 align:start position:0%
and it it is quite unfortunate that the
 
06:35:38.090 --> 06:35:38.100 align:start position:0%
process of absentee voting given its
 
06:35:40.070 --> 06:35:40.080 align:start position:0%
history and given its long-standing in
 
06:35:41.510 --> 06:35:41.520 align:start position:0%
the United States has become such a
 
06:35:44.690 --> 06:35:44.700 align:start position:0%
partisan tool over these last few Cycles
 
06:35:46.910 --> 06:35:46.920 align:start position:0%
free and fair voting is one of the
 
06:35:49.250 --> 06:35:49.260 align:start position:0%
Bedrock processes which keeps this
 
06:35:52.490 --> 06:35:52.500 align:start position:0%
nation's politics vibrant and strong and
 
06:35:54.410 --> 06:35:54.420 align:start position:0%
the practice of absentee voting ensures
 
06:35:56.868 --> 06:35:56.878 align:start position:0%
every citizen their right to cast a
 
06:35:58.250 --> 06:35:58.260 align:start position:0%
ballot for those who they want to
 
06:35:59.868 --> 06:35:59.878 align:start position:0%
represent them in the halls of
 
06:35:59.878 --> 06:36:01.010 align:start position:0%
represent them in the halls of
government

06:36:01.010 --> 06:36:01.020 align:start position:0%
government
 
06:36:04.190 --> 06:36:04.200 align:start position:0%
House Bill 508 says to a voter who
 
06:36:06.170 --> 06:36:06.180 align:start position:0%
determines they need to use the absentee
 
06:36:08.628 --> 06:36:08.638 align:start position:0%
system to perform their civic duty that
 
06:36:10.850 --> 06:36:10.860 align:start position:0%
their ballot will come with the correct
 
06:36:13.970 --> 06:36:13.980 align:start position:0%
postage when received the many elections
 
06:36:17.208 --> 06:36:17.218 align:start position:0%
we have also means many ballots in all
 
06:36:19.070 --> 06:36:19.080 align:start position:0%
different sizes in all different shapes
 
06:36:21.288 --> 06:36:21.298 align:start position:0%
and the stamps required to mail out a
 
06:36:22.610 --> 06:36:22.620 align:start position:0%
ballot in Peterborough might be
 
06:36:24.530 --> 06:36:24.540 align:start position:0%
different than the stamps required to
 
06:36:26.810 --> 06:36:26.820 align:start position:0%
mail out a ballot in Windham
 
06:36:28.610 --> 06:36:28.620 align:start position:0%
which has many more candidates on a
 
06:36:30.530 --> 06:36:30.540 align:start position:0%
given general election ballot
 
06:36:32.690 --> 06:36:32.700 align:start position:0%
some ballots being so heavy as to
 
06:36:35.750 --> 06:36:35.760 align:start position:0%
require multiple stamps there is no
 
06:36:38.750 --> 06:36:38.760 align:start position:0%
posted standard for our elections
 
06:36:41.090 --> 06:36:41.100 align:start position:0%
the voters who request an absentee
 
06:36:43.610 --> 06:36:43.620 align:start position:0%
ballot are people who already have a
 
06:36:45.708 --> 06:36:45.718 align:start position:0%
tough enough time requesting the ballot
 
06:36:47.930 --> 06:36:47.940 align:start position:0%
however that however unbelievable that
 
06:36:50.690 --> 06:36:50.700 align:start position:0%
may be for us able-bodied folks those
 
06:36:53.330 --> 06:36:53.340 align:start position:0%
same barriers exist for them simply
 
06:36:55.490 --> 06:36:55.500 align:start position:0%
stepping outside of the house let alone
 
06:36:59.208 --> 06:36:59.218 align:start position:0%
dealing with the bureaucracy of voting
 
06:37:01.490 --> 06:37:01.500 align:start position:0%
so when I read the committee report by
 
06:37:03.708 --> 06:37:03.718 align:start position:0%
my friend from Hudson I cringe a little
 
06:37:05.628 --> 06:37:05.638 align:start position:0%
bit thinking of my differently abled
 
06:37:07.490 --> 06:37:07.500 align:start position:0%
brothers and sisters in my community and
 
06:37:09.410 --> 06:37:09.420 align:start position:0%
throughout this state who know how hard
 
06:37:11.690 --> 06:37:11.700 align:start position:0%
it is in this day and age to do even the
 
06:37:13.970 --> 06:37:13.980 align:start position:0%
basic of tasks let alone like I said
 
06:37:16.970 --> 06:37:16.980 align:start position:0%
vote and again however hard that may be
 
06:37:19.190 --> 06:37:19.200 align:start position:0%
for us with enough energy to sit here
 
06:37:21.770 --> 06:37:21.780 align:start position:0%
all day to believe this is the reality
 
06:37:24.110 --> 06:37:24.120 align:start position:0%
for people in our state
 
06:37:26.270 --> 06:37:26.280 align:start position:0%
the cost outlined in the committee
 
06:37:28.750 --> 06:37:28.760 align:start position:0%
report of researching the candidates
 
06:37:31.368 --> 06:37:31.378 align:start position:0%
Transportation or time taken to place
 
06:37:33.350 --> 06:37:33.360 align:start position:0%
one's vote are all something that
 
06:37:35.930 --> 06:37:35.940 align:start position:0%
someone who's voting absentee also must
 
06:37:38.270 --> 06:37:38.280 align:start position:0%
incur and I do not purport to believe
 
06:37:41.330 --> 06:37:41.340 align:start position:0%
that those personal costs should not be
 
06:37:43.430 --> 06:37:43.440 align:start position:0%
when an individual has incurred the cost
 
06:37:45.830 --> 06:37:45.840 align:start position:0%
of getting out of the house driving to
 
06:37:47.750 --> 06:37:47.760 align:start position:0%
their Town Clerk and requesting an
 
06:37:49.368 --> 06:37:49.378 align:start position:0%
absentee ballot they should be treated
 
06:37:51.470 --> 06:37:51.480 align:start position:0%
no differently than the person who takes
 
06:37:53.628 --> 06:37:53.638 align:start position:0%
the time on Election Day to get out of
 
06:37:55.430 --> 06:37:55.440 align:start position:0%
their house drive to the polling place
 
06:37:59.390 --> 06:37:59.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:38:01.310 --> 06:38:01.320 align:start position:0%
to pay a dollar to the feds to put your
 
06:38:03.110 --> 06:38:03.120 align:start position:0%
ballot in the accounting machine at your
 
06:38:05.750 --> 06:38:05.760 align:start position:0%
polling place no you do not and that
 
06:38:07.730 --> 06:38:07.740 align:start position:0%
would be absolutely ridiculous if you
 
06:38:10.850 --> 06:38:10.860 align:start position:0%
did so why should a voter who has to pay
 
06:38:13.368 --> 06:38:13.378 align:start position:0%
who has to use an absentee ballot have
 
06:38:15.948 --> 06:38:15.958 align:start position:0%
to pay a dollar to the feds to have that
 
06:38:18.350 --> 06:38:18.360 align:start position:0%
ballot counted via the mail
 
06:38:21.110 --> 06:38:21.120 align:start position:0%
what do we pay taxes for
 
06:38:24.070 --> 06:38:24.080 align:start position:0%
the status quo has voters in two classes
 
06:38:26.330 --> 06:38:26.340 align:start position:0%
those who put their ballot in the
 
06:38:29.030 --> 06:38:29.040 align:start position:0%
machine for no cost and those who mail
 
06:38:31.010 --> 06:38:31.020 align:start position:0%
out their ballot with a postage cost to
 
06:38:32.390 --> 06:38:32.400 align:start position:0%
the federal government
 
06:38:34.910 --> 06:38:34.920 align:start position:0%
contrary to what my friend from Hudson
 
06:38:36.830 --> 06:38:36.840 align:start position:0%
said in the committee report this
 
06:38:38.628 --> 06:38:38.638 align:start position:0%
legislation takes us another step
 
06:38:41.150 --> 06:38:41.160 align:start position:0%
forward in breaking up the status quo of
 
06:38:42.770 --> 06:38:42.780 align:start position:0%
having two different classes of Voters
 
06:38:45.288 --> 06:38:45.298 align:start position:0%
and ensuring the rights of every citizen
 
06:38:48.350 --> 06:38:48.360 align:start position:0%
are upheld as by we those who swore to
 
06:38:49.670 --> 06:38:49.680 align:start position:0%
do so
 
06:38:52.190 --> 06:38:52.200 align:start position:0%
now I wish I could claim I had some
 
06:38:54.590 --> 06:38:54.600 align:start position:0%
genius original idea here but
 
06:38:56.868 --> 06:38:56.878 align:start position:0%
unfortunately for me and my ego I did
 
06:38:59.570 --> 06:38:59.580 align:start position:0%
not this is a proposal which has been
 
06:39:01.788 --> 06:39:01.798 align:start position:0%
implemented in 19 States
 
06:39:05.510 --> 06:39:05.520 align:start position:0%
and counting on a bipartisan basis not
 
06:39:07.850 --> 06:39:07.860 align:start position:0%
just scary liberal states like
 
06:39:10.010 --> 06:39:10.020 align:start position:0%
Washington Rhode Island Maryland and
 
06:39:13.070 --> 06:39:13.080 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts but ruby red States like
 
06:39:16.490 --> 06:39:16.500 align:start position:0%
West Virginia Idaho and Missouri Iowa as
 
06:39:18.530 --> 06:39:18.540 align:start position:0%
well have also implemented similar
 
06:39:20.750 --> 06:39:20.760 align:start position:0%
programs this is a common sense proposal
 
06:39:22.850 --> 06:39:22.860 align:start position:0%
which guarantees no one is paying a
 
06:39:24.770 --> 06:39:24.780 align:start position:0%
dollar to the feds once they've made the
 
06:39:26.750 --> 06:39:26.760 align:start position:0%
journey to vote and that no one's ballot
 
06:39:28.910 --> 06:39:28.920 align:start position:0%
gets bounced back for something as silly
 
06:39:31.070 --> 06:39:31.080 align:start position:0%
as it being too heavy
 
06:39:33.350 --> 06:39:33.360 align:start position:0%
everyone at some point or another may
 
06:39:36.048 --> 06:39:36.058 align:start position:0%
have to use an absentee ballot and we
 
06:39:37.670 --> 06:39:37.680 align:start position:0%
pay taxes for the roads not because
 
06:39:39.410 --> 06:39:39.420 align:start position:0%
everyone will use them
 
06:39:42.350 --> 06:39:42.360 align:start position:0%
but because everyone can use them same
 
06:39:44.330 --> 06:39:44.340 align:start position:0%
can be said for our schools and so many
 
06:39:47.510 --> 06:39:47.520 align:start position:0%
other public institutions the postage on
 
06:39:49.250 --> 06:39:49.260 align:start position:0%
an absentee ballot isn't anywhere near
 
06:39:51.590 --> 06:39:51.600 align:start position:0%
as poor important as the roads or our
 
06:39:53.750 --> 06:39:53.760 align:start position:0%
schools and I won't claim it to be
 
06:39:56.868 --> 06:39:56.878 align:start position:0%
but voting is still a public right
 
06:39:59.090 --> 06:39:59.100 align:start position:0%
and once an absentee ballot is filled
 
06:40:00.830 --> 06:40:00.840 align:start position:0%
out it should be received without paying
 
06:40:02.690 --> 06:40:02.700 align:start position:0%
a dollar to the feds when you mail it
 
06:40:05.628 --> 06:40:05.638 align:start position:0%
we've paid our taxes and those taxes
 
06:40:07.670 --> 06:40:07.680 align:start position:0%
should be used to guarantee each right
 
06:40:09.890 --> 06:40:09.900 align:start position:0%
and service is properly and effectively
 
06:40:13.548 --> 06:40:13.558 align:start position:0%
funded including something as small as a
 
06:40:15.708 --> 06:40:15.718 align:start position:0%
postage on yours or another person's
 
06:40:19.730 --> 06:40:19.740 align:start position:0%
absentee ballot so join me in voting
 
06:40:21.410 --> 06:40:21.420 align:start position:0%
against this committee report so we can
 
06:40:23.150 --> 06:40:23.160 align:start position:0%
be the 20th state to realize this
 
06:40:25.730 --> 06:40:25.740 align:start position:0%
impactful but Small Change is the right
 
06:40:27.708 --> 06:40:27.718 align:start position:0%
way to move forward as a state thank you
 
06:40:29.270 --> 06:40:29.280 align:start position:0%
very much there's a member of yield the
 
06:40:29.280 --> 06:40:30.430 align:start position:0%
very much there's a member of yield the
questions

06:40:30.430 --> 06:40:30.440 align:start position:0%
questions
 
06:40:34.310 --> 06:40:34.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:40:37.250 --> 06:40:37.260 align:start position:0%

sorry to my friends
 
06:40:41.690 --> 06:40:41.700 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker and thank you
 
06:40:43.850 --> 06:40:43.860 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
 
06:40:46.070 --> 06:40:46.080 align:start position:0%
would it be a logical extension of this
 
06:40:48.230 --> 06:40:48.240 align:start position:0%
program to offer mileage to voters who
 
06:40:50.208 --> 06:40:50.218 align:start position:0%
drive to the polls no wouldn't as I said
 
06:40:53.030 --> 06:40:53.040 align:start position:0%
in my speech someone who drives to the
 
06:40:55.250 --> 06:40:55.260 align:start position:0%
town clerk or is as the same as someone
 
06:40:57.110 --> 06:40:57.120 align:start position:0%
who drives to the polling place so we
 
06:40:58.610 --> 06:40:58.620 align:start position:0%
wouldn't pay for you to go to the
 
06:41:00.410 --> 06:41:00.420 align:start position:0%
polling place this is about once you
 
06:41:02.690 --> 06:41:02.700 align:start position:0%
have requested a ballot that ballot
 
06:41:04.128 --> 06:41:04.138 align:start position:0%
should come with the necessary things
 
06:41:05.750 --> 06:41:05.760 align:start position:0%
that's needed to have that ballot
 
06:41:08.208 --> 06:41:08.218 align:start position:0%
counted I'm not talking about going to
 
06:41:09.708 --> 06:41:09.718 align:start position:0%
the polling place going to the polling
 
06:41:11.810 --> 06:41:11.820 align:start position:0%
place as I said here should still have
 
06:41:14.030 --> 06:41:14.040 align:start position:0%
some cost personal costs just as going
 
06:41:17.690 --> 06:41:17.700 align:start position:0%
 
06:41:20.330 --> 06:41:20.340 align:start position:0%
motion before us is inexperiential
 
06:41:22.548 --> 06:41:22.558 align:start position:0%
legislator in House Bill 508 share
 
06:41:29.510 --> 06:41:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:41:31.788 --> 06:41:31.798 align:start position:0%
thank you I will not be as eloquent as
 
06:41:33.830 --> 06:41:33.840 align:start position:0%
my colleague from Peterborough but I
 
06:41:35.930 --> 06:41:35.940 align:start position:0%
will be brief
 
06:41:38.270 --> 06:41:38.280 align:start position:0%
um Point number one
 
06:41:39.830 --> 06:41:39.840 align:start position:0%
um this asks for a hundred thousand
 
06:41:42.530 --> 06:41:42.540 align:start position:0%
annually for prepaid postage on absentee
 
06:41:44.510 --> 06:41:44.520 align:start position:0%
ballot return envelopes
 
06:41:47.030 --> 06:41:47.040 align:start position:0%
inherent with the great privilege to
 
06:41:49.910 --> 06:41:49.920 align:start position:0%
vote is an intrinsic cost to vote so
 
06:41:51.770 --> 06:41:51.780 align:start position:0%
whether it's time transportation or
 
06:41:55.490 --> 06:41:55.500 align:start position:0%
postage voters bear some nominal cost
 
06:41:57.590 --> 06:41:57.600 align:start position:0%
by spending a hundred thousand annually
 
06:42:00.170 --> 06:42:00.180 align:start position:0%
for prepaid postage on absentee ballot
 
06:42:03.048 --> 06:42:03.058 align:start position:0%
return envelopes this bill would create
 
06:42:05.570 --> 06:42:05.580 align:start position:0%
two classes of Voters the reimburse
 
06:42:08.990 --> 06:42:09.000 align:start position:0%
voter and the unpaid unreimbursed voter
 
06:42:10.910 --> 06:42:10.920 align:start position:0%
if one goes down the reimbursement
 
06:42:13.788 --> 06:42:13.798 align:start position:0%
Rabbit Hole where would it end should
 
06:42:17.030 --> 06:42:17.040 align:start position:0%
pen or ink or mileage be reimbursed
 
06:42:18.830 --> 06:42:18.840 align:start position:0%
should the postage for the absentee
 
06:42:21.650 --> 06:42:21.660 align:start position:0%
ballot request be reimbursed when does
 
06:42:23.690 --> 06:42:23.700 align:start position:0%
reimbursement end
 
06:42:26.750 --> 06:42:26.760 align:start position:0%
how much of the annual cost will be
 
06:42:29.930 --> 06:42:29.940 align:start position:0%
wasted because of unused prepaid
 
06:42:29.940 --> 06:42:31.610 align:start position:0%
wasted because of unused prepaid
envelopes

06:42:31.610 --> 06:42:31.620 align:start position:0%

no evidence was provided by the sponsors
 
06:42:39.048 --> 06:42:39.058 align:start position:0%
as to the extent of this alleged issue
 
06:42:41.690 --> 06:42:41.700 align:start position:0%
at a hundred thousand annually perhaps
 
06:42:44.868 --> 06:42:44.878 align:start position:0%
this bill is a massive solution trying
 
06:42:47.390 --> 06:42:47.400 align:start position:0%
to fix a problem that is really less
 
06:42:49.970 --> 06:42:49.980 align:start position:0%
than the size of a proverbial postage
 
06:42:49.980 --> 06:42:51.590 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr Speaker
 
06:44:19.310 --> 06:44:19.320 align:start position:0%
if I know that it is that ensuring
 
06:44:21.350 --> 06:44:21.360 align:start position:0%
election integrity means that election
 
06:44:23.868 --> 06:44:23.878 align:start position:0%
officials receive absentee ballots in a
 
06:44:26.090 --> 06:44:26.100 align:start position:0%
timely and secure Manner and if I know
 
06:44:27.830 --> 06:44:27.840 align:start position:0%
that this bill is eliminating another
 
06:44:29.930 --> 06:44:29.940 align:start position:0%
fee associated with voting
 
06:44:31.910 --> 06:44:31.920 align:start position:0%
and if I know that this is a low-cost
 
06:44:34.070 --> 06:44:34.080 align:start position:0%
measure to prevent potential obstacles
 
06:44:37.190 --> 06:44:37.200 align:start position:0%
when voting that 19 other states as well
 
06:44:40.010 --> 06:44:40.020 align:start position:0%
as Washington DC have approved
 
06:44:42.350 --> 06:44:42.360 align:start position:0%
and if I know that this puts the tax
 
06:44:44.208 --> 06:44:44.218 align:start position:0%
burden on the state rather than the
 
06:44:44.218 --> 06:44:45.230 align:start position:0%
burden on the state rather than the
individual

06:44:45.230 --> 06:44:45.240 align:start position:0%
individual
 
06:44:47.510 --> 06:44:47.520 align:start position:0%

committee
 
06:49:21.770 --> 06:49:21.780 align:start position:0%
minority of the committee having
 
06:49:23.390 --> 06:49:23.400 align:start position:0%
considered the same to be an unable to
 
06:49:24.948 --> 06:49:24.958 align:start position:0%
agree with the majority Report with a
 
06:49:26.270 --> 06:49:26.280 align:start position:0%
recommendation that the bill ought to
 
06:49:28.250 --> 06:49:28.260 align:start position:0%
pass Senator Jesse Grody for the
 
06:49:30.530 --> 06:49:30.540 align:start position:0%
majority minority of the committee
 
06:49:39.350 --> 06:49:39.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:49:42.890 --> 06:49:42.900 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker House Bill 4th 341
 
06:49:46.570 --> 06:49:46.580 align:start position:0%
is the policy bill that establishes a
 
06:49:50.090 --> 06:49:50.100 align:start position:0%
licensure for massage establishments
 
06:49:54.230 --> 06:49:54.240 align:start position:0%
new to New Hampshire in that we have
 
06:49:56.390 --> 06:49:56.400 align:start position:0%
many establishments that are licensed
 
06:50:01.448 --> 06:50:01.458 align:start position:0%
such as salons work sites Bank
 
06:50:01.458 --> 06:50:03.430 align:start position:0%
such as salons work sites Bank
barbers

06:50:03.430 --> 06:50:03.440 align:start position:0%
barbers
 
06:50:06.650 --> 06:50:06.660 align:start position:0%
estheticians cosmetologists
 
06:50:11.048 --> 06:50:11.058 align:start position:0%
 
06:50:14.750 --> 06:50:14.760 align:start position:0%
so what does that mean
 
06:50:17.030 --> 06:50:17.040 align:start position:0%
in oplc there are three divisions
 
06:50:18.830 --> 06:50:18.840 align:start position:0%
there's the um
 
06:50:21.650 --> 06:50:21.660 align:start position:0%
investigative division there's the
 
06:50:23.770 --> 06:50:23.780 align:start position:0%
compliance Division and there's the
 
06:50:26.030 --> 06:50:26.040 align:start position:0%
disciplinary division
 
06:50:29.708 --> 06:50:29.718 align:start position:0%
so what a massage establishment license
 
06:50:33.170 --> 06:50:33.180 align:start position:0%
does is allows oplc
 
06:50:35.868 --> 06:50:35.878 align:start position:0%
to check for compliance
 
06:50:39.230 --> 06:50:39.240 align:start position:0%
to the rules of that board
 
06:50:39.240 --> 06:50:40.968 align:start position:0%
to the rules of that board
and

06:50:40.968 --> 06:50:40.978 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:50:44.390 --> 06:50:44.400 align:start position:0%
so this means that after this bill were
 
06:50:45.468 --> 06:50:45.478 align:start position:0%
to pass
 
06:50:47.570 --> 06:50:47.580 align:start position:0%
there would have to be rules established
 
06:50:49.968 --> 06:50:49.978 align:start position:0%
and these rules are done in compliance
 
06:50:52.910 --> 06:50:52.920 align:start position:0%
with the board and oplc
 
06:50:54.650 --> 06:50:54.660 align:start position:0%
so I wanted to go through this example
 
06:50:58.670 --> 06:50:58.680 align:start position:0%
with you because it's just not passing a
 
06:51:02.570 --> 06:51:02.580 align:start position:0%
bill it means establishing rules that
 
06:51:02.580 --> 06:51:04.430 align:start position:0%
bill it means establishing rules that
are

06:51:04.430 --> 06:51:04.440 align:start position:0%
are
 
06:51:07.610 --> 06:51:07.620 align:start position:0%
that are decided by the board and the
 
06:51:10.310 --> 06:51:10.320 align:start position:0%
agency which is oplc and then approved
 
06:51:12.288 --> 06:51:12.298 align:start position:0%
by gel car I think you heard
 
06:51:15.170 --> 06:51:15.180 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire mention gel car a
 
06:51:16.910 --> 06:51:16.920 align:start position:0%
little earlier
 
06:51:21.590 --> 06:51:21.600 align:start position:0%
so I hope that you will overturn the itl
 
06:51:24.890 --> 06:51:24.900 align:start position:0%
by voting red so that a better motion
 
06:51:29.330 --> 06:51:29.340 align:start position:0%
another motion can be made thank you
 
06:51:36.288 --> 06:51:36.298 align:start position:0%
 
06:51:38.030 --> 06:51:38.040 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
06:51:40.670 --> 06:51:40.680 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker this bill establishes yet
 
06:51:42.350 --> 06:51:42.360 align:start position:0%
another licensed businesses will have to
 
06:51:43.490 --> 06:51:43.500 align:start position:0%
comply with
 
06:51:45.590 --> 06:51:45.600 align:start position:0%
this license is another set of paperwork
 
06:51:47.750 --> 06:51:47.760 align:start position:0%
we have to burden our already licensed
 
06:51:50.150 --> 06:51:50.160 align:start position:0%
massage providers with this licensing
 
06:51:52.610 --> 06:51:52.620 align:start position:0%
will allow oplc inspectors to inspect
 
06:51:53.868 --> 06:51:53.878 align:start position:0%
the premises of these businesses
 
06:51:56.270 --> 06:51:56.280 align:start position:0%
creating a potential Fourth Amendment
 
06:51:58.968 --> 06:51:58.978 align:start position:0%
violations on the par on the part of the
 
06:52:01.670 --> 06:52:01.680 align:start position:0%
state being that the Fourth Amendment of
 
06:52:03.410 --> 06:52:03.420 align:start position:0%
the Constitution uh protects the right
 
06:52:04.670 --> 06:52:04.680 align:start position:0%
of the people to be secure in their
 
06:52:06.830 --> 06:52:06.840 align:start position:0%
papers and effects and protects them
 
06:52:08.570 --> 06:52:08.580 align:start position:0%
from warrantless searches
 
06:52:11.750 --> 06:52:11.760 align:start position:0%
Additionally the aim of this bill was to
 
06:52:13.730 --> 06:52:13.740 align:start position:0%
uh in part is to reduce sex trafficking
 
06:52:15.048 --> 06:52:15.058 align:start position:0%
in the state by targeting the massage
 
06:52:17.570 --> 06:52:17.580 align:start position:0%
establishments this will have little or
 
06:52:20.628 --> 06:52:20.638 align:start position:0%
no effect because any illegal businesses
 
06:52:22.968 --> 06:52:22.978 align:start position:0%
of this kind will Rebrand retool or
 
06:52:25.490 --> 06:52:25.500 align:start position:0%
simply not comply with a statue that
 
06:52:27.770 --> 06:52:27.780 align:start position:0%
requires periodic inspections especially
 
06:52:29.690 --> 06:52:29.700 align:start position:0%
when uncompliance only carries a
 
06:52:31.310 --> 06:52:31.320 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor charge
 
06:52:33.948 --> 06:52:33.958 align:start position:0%
this will give more work to oplc and it
 
06:52:36.948 --> 06:52:36.958 align:start position:0%
is unwise to put oplc inspectors in a
 
06:52:38.030 --> 06:52:38.040 align:start position:0%
situation where they could be
 
06:52:40.250 --> 06:52:40.260 align:start position:0%
investigating these kind of crimes and
 
06:52:42.010 --> 06:52:42.020 align:start position:0%
should be reserved for law enforcement
 
06:52:44.330 --> 06:52:44.340 align:start position:0%
ask you to support the committee
 
06:52:47.868 --> 06:52:47.878 align:start position:0%

will simply give licenses and an
 
06:54:43.968 --> 06:54:43.978 align:start position:0%
oversight to massage parlies just like
 
06:54:46.910 --> 06:54:46.920 align:start position:0%

the eyes have it the amendment is
adopted

06:59:26.270 --> 06:59:26.280 align:start position:0%
adopted
 
06:59:28.010 --> 06:59:28.020 align:start position:0%
the motion before us now was ought to
 
06:59:30.368 --> 06:59:30.378 align:start position:0%
pass as amended the chair recognizes
 
06:59:38.030 --> 06:59:38.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:59:41.628 --> 06:59:41.638 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you Mr chair uh
 
06:59:44.750 --> 06:59:44.760 align:start position:0%
speaker sorry wrong environment
 
06:59:46.788 --> 06:59:46.798 align:start position:0%
um as mentioned the original bill would
 
06:59:48.650 --> 06:59:48.660 align:start position:0%
have stood up a whole new department for
 
06:59:51.530 --> 06:59:51.540 align:start position:0%
a pilot program and without that the
 
06:59:53.930 --> 06:59:53.940 align:start position:0%
bill probably would have gone to the
 
06:59:55.670 --> 06:59:55.680 align:start position:0%
education committee which would have
 
06:59:56.990 --> 06:59:57.000 align:start position:0%
been the appropriate place to vet
 
06:59:59.048 --> 06:59:59.058 align:start position:0%
something like this
 
07:00:03.110 --> 07:00:03.120 align:start position:0%
what this bill would do is put in place
 
07:00:06.410 --> 07:00:06.420 align:start position:0%
a three-year pilot program
 
07:00:10.190 --> 07:00:10.200 align:start position:0%
for funding a Pre-K you know
 
07:00:13.548 --> 07:00:13.558 align:start position:0%
pre-kindergarten education program
 
07:00:15.830 --> 07:00:15.840 align:start position:0%
and while there are studies that show
 
07:00:17.810 --> 07:00:17.820 align:start position:0%
Pre-K education has positive results
 
07:00:20.208 --> 07:00:20.218 align:start position:0%
there are actually many others including
 
07:00:22.010 --> 07:00:22.020 align:start position:0%
quite good ones that shows results
 
07:00:25.610 --> 07:00:25.620 align:start position:0%
ranging from no benefits to actually uh
 
07:00:29.030 --> 07:00:29.040 align:start position:0%
uh harmful results the only randomized
 
07:00:31.190 --> 07:00:31.200 align:start position:0%
controlled trial of a Statewide pre-k
 
07:00:33.468 --> 07:00:33.478 align:start position:0%
program showed there was Improvement
 
07:00:35.390 --> 07:00:35.400 align:start position:0%
after the first year
 
07:00:38.150 --> 07:00:38.160 align:start position:0%
after the third grade Pre-K children did
 
07:00:40.548 --> 07:00:40.558 align:start position:0%
a little worse than the controls and
 
07:00:42.468 --> 07:00:42.478 align:start position:0%
after sixth grade Pre-K children did
 
07:00:44.510 --> 07:00:44.520 align:start position:0%
worse on all areas Math Science and
 
07:00:46.968 --> 07:00:46.978 align:start position:0%
reading and that was actually done by a
 
07:00:49.010 --> 07:00:49.020 align:start position:0%
Vanderbilt University
 
07:00:51.468 --> 07:00:51.478 align:start position:0%
there's been no evidence of improvement
 
07:00:54.610 --> 07:00:54.620 align:start position:0%
in National assessment of educational
 
07:00:57.170 --> 07:00:57.180 align:start position:0%
progress the knee app scores for
 
07:00:59.510 --> 07:00:59.520 align:start position:0%
children have taken Pre-K versus those
 
07:01:02.868 --> 07:01:02.878 align:start position:0%
who have not been in pre-K school and as
 
07:01:03.890 --> 07:01:03.900 align:start position:0%
I said there were studies done by
 
07:01:05.690 --> 07:01:05.700 align:start position:0%
Vanderbilt also Harvard University and
 
07:01:07.250 --> 07:01:07.260 align:start position:0%
one in Germany that shows similar
 
07:01:07.260 --> 07:01:08.628 align:start position:0%
one in Germany that shows similar
results

07:01:08.628 --> 07:01:08.638 align:start position:0%
results
 
07:01:10.910 --> 07:01:10.920 align:start position:0%
the other issue is a three-year pilot is
 
07:01:13.850 --> 07:01:13.860 align:start position:0%
too short there may be some improvement
 
07:01:17.150 --> 07:01:17.160 align:start position:0%
over the short term but the you know
 
07:01:19.548 --> 07:01:19.558 align:start position:0%
lack of improvement or potentially worse
 
07:01:21.650 --> 07:01:21.660 align:start position:0%
can show up later and that's what some
 
07:01:24.410 --> 07:01:24.420 align:start position:0%
of the studies showed so the risk is is
 
07:01:27.350 --> 07:01:27.360 align:start position:0%
that we run this pilot program are
 
07:01:29.510 --> 07:01:29.520 align:start position:0%
convinced that it actually is benefiting
 
07:01:31.548 --> 07:01:31.558 align:start position:0%
children when in fact it may not in the
 
07:01:32.570 --> 07:01:32.580 align:start position:0%
longer run
 
07:01:34.670 --> 07:01:34.680 align:start position:0%
and that's that's a problem and so we
 
07:01:36.590 --> 07:01:36.600 align:start position:0%
should not go down this path please
 
07:01:39.650 --> 07:01:39.660 align:start position:0%
support itl or oppose in this case
 
07:01:43.430 --> 07:01:43.440 align:start position:0%
otpa on House Bill 620 thank you
 
07:01:51.070 --> 07:01:51.080 align:start position:0%
 
07:01:54.708 --> 07:01:54.718 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
07:01:57.110 --> 07:01:57.120 align:start position:0%
I rise today in support of House Bill
 
07:02:00.650 --> 07:02:00.660 align:start position:0%
620 as amended 50 years of research
 
07:02:03.110 --> 07:02:03.120 align:start position:0%
attest to the fact that vital learning
 
07:02:05.930 --> 07:02:05.940 align:start position:0%
happens before the age of five New
 
07:02:08.628 --> 07:02:08.638 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has a child care crisis
 
07:02:10.610 --> 07:02:10.620 align:start position:0%
any of you young mothers know what it's
 
07:02:10.620 --> 07:02:11.390 align:start position:0%
any of you young mothers know what it's
like

07:02:11.390 --> 07:02:11.400 align:start position:0%
like
 
07:02:13.610 --> 07:02:13.620 align:start position:0%
I can remember what it was like when my
 
07:02:15.530 --> 07:02:15.540 align:start position:0%
children were little and then my my
 
07:02:18.468 --> 07:02:18.478 align:start position:0%
children went and saw it
 
07:02:20.810 --> 07:02:20.820 align:start position:0%
quality daycare which wasn't always
 
07:02:20.820 --> 07:02:22.250 align:start position:0%
quality daycare which wasn't always
available

07:02:22.250 --> 07:02:22.260 align:start position:0%
available
 
07:02:24.708 --> 07:02:24.718 align:start position:0%
and there's an urgent need for our state
 
07:02:27.350 --> 07:02:27.360 align:start position:0%
to deliver early learning resources
 
07:02:30.890 --> 07:02:30.900 align:start position:0%
early care and education are a critical
 
07:02:33.288 --> 07:02:33.298 align:start position:0%
resource for young children and working
 
07:02:36.350 --> 07:02:36.360 align:start position:0%
families and allows parents to remain in
 
07:02:38.628 --> 07:02:38.638 align:start position:0%
the workforce while providing a healthy
 
07:02:40.850 --> 07:02:40.860 align:start position:0%
learning environment for their children
 
07:02:43.730 --> 07:02:43.740 align:start position:0%
to ensure that all children reach their
 
07:02:46.610 --> 07:02:46.620 align:start position:0%
potential we must reimagine public
 
07:02:50.390 --> 07:02:50.400 align:start position:0%
education as a system that begins not in
 
07:02:53.288 --> 07:02:53.298 align:start position:0%
kindergarten but with high quality
 
07:02:55.968 --> 07:02:55.978 align:start position:0%
pre-kindergarten that demonstrates and
 
07:02:59.510 --> 07:02:59.520 align:start position:0%
acknowledges the value of high excuse me
 
07:03:02.110 --> 07:03:02.120 align:start position:0%
the value of early learning

by by voting yes on HB 620 New Hampshire
 
07:03:15.230 --> 07:03:15.240 align:start position:0%

07:06:28.190 --> 07:06:28.200 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr secure if I know that this

thank you Mr secure if I know that this

07:06:29.208 --> 07:06:29.218 align:start position:0%
bill
 
07:06:33.468 --> 07:06:33.478 align:start position:0%
conflates child care with education
 
07:06:37.250 --> 07:06:37.260 align:start position:0%
and it this bill also attempts to use
 
07:06:40.490 --> 07:06:40.500 align:start position:0%
mostly one-time money to establish a
 
07:06:40.500 --> 07:06:41.570 align:start position:0%

of this of the state government

and if I know that the pilot program is
 
07:06:53.990 --> 07:06:54.000 align:start position:0%
too short to be effective
 
07:06:57.048 --> 07:06:57.058 align:start position:0%
and that
 
07:07:00.288 --> 07:07:00.298 align:start position:0%
there are it also violates local control
 
07:07:04.128 --> 07:07:04.138 align:start position:0%
by establishing a state program for what
 
07:07:07.070 --> 07:07:07.080 align:start position:0%
should be local what I
 
07:07:09.350 --> 07:07:09.360 align:start position:0%
push the red button and oppose ought to
 
07:07:09.360 --> 07:07:12.230 align:start position:0%

if I know that my family and I escaped

from communist Cuba
 
07:12:14.930 --> 07:12:14.940 align:start position:0%

that communism is inherently evil
 
07:12:27.468 --> 07:12:27.478 align:start position:0%
and if I know
 
07:12:29.750 --> 07:12:29.760 align:start position:0%
that the lack of knowledge on the

07:12:33.890 --> 07:12:33.900 align:start position:0%

speaker
 
07:12:54.170 --> 07:12:54.180 align:start position:0%
if I know this bill requires
 
07:12:55.968 --> 07:12:55.978 align:start position:0%
for a high school student to graduate
 
07:12:58.910 --> 07:12:58.920 align:start position:0%
from high school to have a one-hour
 
07:13:01.430 --> 07:13:01.440 align:start position:0%

other class
 
07:13:08.750 --> 07:13:08.760 align:start position:0%
and if I know that for one hour of
 
07:13:08.760 --> 07:13:09.890 align:start position:0%
and if I know that for one hour of
instruction

07:13:09.890 --> 07:13:09.900 align:start position:0%
instruction
 
07:13:12.110 --> 07:13:12.120 align:start position:0%
without any kind of guidelines what that
 
07:13:16.310 --> 07:13:16.320 align:start position:0%
con instruction on communism may be
 
07:13:19.310 --> 07:13:19.320 align:start position:0%
you could have things taught that maybe
 
07:13:21.468 --> 07:13:21.478 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be taught
 
07:13:24.830 --> 07:13:24.840 align:start position:0%
and if I know that when we adopt these
 
07:13:27.530 --> 07:13:27.540 align:start position:0%
types of standards
 
07:13:31.010 --> 07:13:31.020 align:start position:0%
and requirements for graduation from a
 
07:13:32.930 --> 07:13:32.940 align:start position:0%

over asking price for homes guaranteeing
 
07:17:46.430 --> 07:17:46.440 align:start position:0%
they'll win the bid well once they own

the home they can rent it forever making
 
07:17:50.330 --> 07:17:50.340 align:start position:0%
far more in profits and of course they

far more in profits and of course they
do

07:17:51.410 --> 07:17:51.420 align:start position:0%
do
 
07:17:53.330 --> 07:17:53.340 align:start position:0%
according to an article posted in the

Atlantic a quarter of all single-family
 
07:17:58.670 --> 07:17:58.680 align:start position:0%

corporate investor
 
07:18:02.270 --> 07:18:02.280 align:start position:0%
all told nearly a third of American
 
07:18:04.968 --> 07:18:04.978 align:start position:0%
house sales last year went to people who
 
07:18:06.590 --> 07:18:06.600 align:start position:0%
had absolutely no intention of living in
 
07:18:06.600 --> 07:18:07.368 align:start position:0%

07:18:07.368 --> 07:18:07.378 align:start position:0%
them
 
07:18:10.730 --> 07:18:10.740 align:start position:0%
in fact corporate conglomerates like
 
07:18:13.190 --> 07:18:13.200 align:start position:0%
BlackRock are investing heavily in our
 
07:18:15.170 --> 07:18:15.180 align:start position:0%
homes Holmes once passed down over
 
07:18:16.968 --> 07:18:16.978 align:start position:0%
Generations are sold at a rate
 
07:18:19.548 --> 07:18:19.558 align:start position:0%
commensurate to the living standard in
 
07:18:22.070 --> 07:18:22.080 align:start position:0%

07:18:23.570 --> 07:18:23.580 align:start position:0%
thousands of dollars shutting out folks
 
07:18:25.670 --> 07:18:25.680 align:start position:0%
like you and I from the running
 
07:18:28.310 --> 07:18:28.320 align:start position:0%
these properties will be rented out over
 
07:18:30.610 --> 07:18:30.620 align:start position:0%
years their impact on the housing market
 
07:18:32.628 --> 07:18:32.638 align:start position:0%
disconnected completely from the
 
07:18:34.850 --> 07:18:34.860 align:start position:0%
localities in which they sit
 
07:18:36.410 --> 07:18:36.420 align:start position:0%
but there's something else that we're
 
07:18:38.150 --> 07:18:38.160 align:start position:0%
giving away by allowing these massive
 
07:18:40.250 --> 07:18:40.260 align:start position:0%
corporate conglomerates to buy up all of
 
07:18:42.650 --> 07:18:42.660 align:start position:0%
America's homes and rent them until the
 
07:18:45.590 --> 07:18:45.600 align:start position:0%
end of time the American dream
 
07:18:47.090 --> 07:18:47.100 align:start position:0%
for the last several Generations
 
07:18:50.270 --> 07:18:50.280 align:start position:0%
Americans have relied on single-family
 
07:18:52.850 --> 07:18:52.860 align:start position:0%
homes to build a nest egg for retirement
 
07:18:55.250 --> 07:18:55.260 align:start position:0%
they allow you to build equity they're a
 
07:18:57.468 --> 07:18:57.478 align:start position:0%
place to raise a family they allow your
 
07:18:59.930 --> 07:18:59.940 align:start position:0%
kids to stay in the same community
 
07:19:02.510 --> 07:19:02.520 align:start position:0%
long enough to make friends get involved
 
07:19:05.030 --> 07:19:05.040 align:start position:0%
with their local community center and
 
07:19:06.708 --> 07:19:06.718 align:start position:0%
save them the experience of moving every
 
07:19:09.110 --> 07:19:09.120 align:start position:0%
year as often happens with folks who
 
07:19:10.850 --> 07:19:10.860 align:start position:0%
live in apartments
 
07:19:13.910 --> 07:19:13.920 align:start position:0%
they provide families stability homes
 
07:19:16.968 --> 07:19:16.978 align:start position:0%
build community
 
07:19:19.070 --> 07:19:19.080 align:start position:0%
ask your kids or grandkids
 
07:19:22.190 --> 07:19:22.200 align:start position:0%
if uh if they or people their age think
 
07:19:24.048 --> 07:19:24.058 align:start position:0%
that home ownership will be in their
 
07:19:24.058 --> 07:19:25.128 align:start position:0%
that home ownership will be in their
grasp

07:19:25.128 --> 07:19:25.138 align:start position:0%
grasp
 
07:19:26.810 --> 07:19:26.820 align:start position:0%
the answer you're probably going to get
 
07:19:27.830 --> 07:19:27.840 align:start position:0%
is no
 
07:19:29.690 --> 07:19:29.700 align:start position:0%
this is a tragedy and the wealthiest
 
07:19:32.510 --> 07:19:32.520 align:start position:0%
nation in the world where we are blessed
 
07:19:35.090 --> 07:19:35.100 align:start position:0%
by abundance and opportunity but it's
 
07:19:37.548 --> 07:19:37.558 align:start position:0%
our responsibility to defend that
 
07:19:37.558 --> 07:19:39.048 align:start position:0%
our responsibility to defend that
opportunity

07:19:39.048 --> 07:19:39.058 align:start position:0%
opportunity
 
07:19:41.030 --> 07:19:41.040 align:start position:0%
that's why I'm supporting the save our
 
07:19:43.430 --> 07:19:43.440 align:start position:0%
homes act the bill is simple straight
 
07:19:45.410 --> 07:19:45.420 align:start position:0%
from the bill real estate on which
 
07:19:47.270 --> 07:19:47.280 align:start position:0%
single-family housing including
 
07:19:48.948 --> 07:19:48.958 align:start position:0%
single-family housing with one or more
 
07:19:50.868 --> 07:19:50.878 align:start position:0%
accessory dwelling units on it on the
 
07:19:53.150 --> 07:19:53.160 align:start position:0%
same parcel of land or multi-family
 
07:19:56.030 --> 07:19:56.040 align:start position:0%
housing is located may only be acquired
 
07:19:59.570 --> 07:19:59.580 align:start position:0%
in whole or in part by natural persons
 
07:20:01.968 --> 07:20:01.978 align:start position:0%
subject to the following exceptions
 
07:20:04.310 --> 07:20:04.320 align:start position:0%
so in basic terms this bill requires
 
07:20:07.070 --> 07:20:07.080 align:start position:0%
single-family homes to be sold to a real
 
07:20:09.890 --> 07:20:09.900 align:start position:0%
living breathing person
 
07:20:12.770 --> 07:20:12.780 align:start position:0%
not a venture capital firm not a venture
 
07:20:14.628 --> 07:20:14.638 align:start position:0%
capital firm putting on the Groucho Marx
 
07:20:16.490 --> 07:20:16.500 align:start position:0%
disguise and pretending to be an LLC
 
07:20:19.548 --> 07:20:19.558 align:start position:0%
nothing but a natural person
 
07:20:21.230 --> 07:20:21.240 align:start position:0%
there's a grandfathering exception
 
07:20:22.910 --> 07:20:22.920 align:start position:0%
provided that the next buyer is a
 
07:20:24.830 --> 07:20:24.840 align:start position:0%
natural person there's a development
 
07:20:26.628 --> 07:20:26.638 align:start position:0%
exception provided that the property is
 
07:20:28.310 --> 07:20:28.320 align:start position:0%
sold to a natural person within two
 
07:20:30.590 --> 07:20:30.600 align:start position:0%
years and there's a clarification that
 
07:20:33.590 --> 07:20:33.600 align:start position:0%
this will have no impact on mortgages
 
07:20:35.330 --> 07:20:35.340 align:start position:0%
the opposition of this bill seems to
 
07:20:37.670 --> 07:20:37.680 align:start position:0%
center around the constitutionality
 
07:20:40.190 --> 07:20:40.200 align:start position:0%
concerns and not only could I not agree
 
07:20:42.410 --> 07:20:42.420 align:start position:0%
less about those concerns but they're
 
07:20:44.930 --> 07:20:44.940 align:start position:0%
also not ours to decide the power of
 
07:20:48.048 --> 07:20:48.058 align:start position:0%
judicial review rests
 
07:20:50.208 --> 07:20:50.218 align:start position:0%
solely in the courts
 
07:20:52.250 --> 07:20:52.260 align:start position:0%
this may be the general court but it's
 
07:20:54.110 --> 07:20:54.120 align:start position:0%
not the court court
 
07:20:56.628 --> 07:20:56.638 align:start position:0%
but let's discuss the concerns all the
 
07:20:58.610 --> 07:20:58.620 align:start position:0%
same I would gather the concern center
 
07:21:00.708 --> 07:21:00.718 align:start position:0%
around corporate personhood
 
07:21:02.448 --> 07:21:02.458 align:start position:0%
and the idea that corporations are
 
07:21:02.458 --> 07:21:03.230 align:start position:0%
and the idea that corporations are
people

07:21:03.230 --> 07:21:03.240 align:start position:0%
people
 
07:21:05.150 --> 07:21:05.160 align:start position:0%
setting aside setting that aside for
 
07:21:06.170 --> 07:21:06.180 align:start position:0%
just a moment
 
07:21:08.930 --> 07:21:08.940 align:start position:0%
in our Statute in New Hampshire we
 
07:21:10.910 --> 07:21:10.920 align:start position:0%
already have laws on the books that have
 
07:21:12.468 --> 07:21:12.478 align:start position:0%
different punishments for corporations
 
07:21:15.708 --> 07:21:15.718 align:start position:0%
and people because of course we do in
 
07:21:18.230 --> 07:21:18.240 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire stealing a Lobster Pot is
 
07:21:20.208 --> 07:21:20.218 align:start position:0%
a mere violation if you're a natural
 
07:21:22.788 --> 07:21:22.798 align:start position:0%
person but a crime if done by a
 
07:21:25.490 --> 07:21:25.500 align:start position:0%
corporate entity what about voting your
 
07:21:27.650 --> 07:21:27.660 align:start position:0%
town voter checklist likely doesn't have
 
07:21:29.510 --> 07:21:29.520 align:start position:0%
your local Dunkin Donuts franchise shop
 
07:21:31.250 --> 07:21:31.260 align:start position:0%
on its rolls
 
07:21:33.410 --> 07:21:33.420 align:start position:0%
there are some things afforded to people
 
07:21:35.810 --> 07:21:35.820 align:start position:0%
not afforded corporations
 
07:21:38.090 --> 07:21:38.100 align:start position:0%
and buying a single-family home to raise
 
07:21:39.048 --> 07:21:39.058 align:start position:0%
a family
 
07:21:40.548 --> 07:21:40.558 align:start position:0%
ought to be one of them
 
07:21:42.650 --> 07:21:42.660 align:start position:0%
I believe it's important to keep family
 
07:21:44.448 --> 07:21:44.458 align:start position:0%
homes for families
 
07:21:46.430 --> 07:21:46.440 align:start position:0%
I believe that passing this law will
 
07:21:48.530 --> 07:21:48.540 align:start position:0%
help reduce and eliminate homelessness
 
07:21:49.968 --> 07:21:49.978 align:start position:0%
in our time
 
07:21:52.430 --> 07:21:52.440 align:start position:0%
I will not allow soulless conglomerate
 
07:21:54.948 --> 07:21:54.958 align:start position:0%
corporations to deny anyone the American
 
07:21:54.958 --> 07:21:56.448 align:start position:0%
corporations to deny anyone the American
dream

07:21:56.448 --> 07:21:56.458 align:start position:0%
dream
 
07:21:59.570 --> 07:21:59.580 align:start position:0%
I feel that now is the time to do this
 
07:22:02.208 --> 07:22:02.218 align:start position:0%
there were another crash like the 2008
 
07:22:04.430 --> 07:22:04.440 align:start position:0%
housing crash Banks would be desperate
 
07:22:05.690 --> 07:22:05.700 align:start position:0%
to make up their money
 
07:22:07.730 --> 07:22:07.740 align:start position:0%
making it extremely convenient for
 
07:22:09.468 --> 07:22:09.478 align:start position:0%
companies like BlackRock to swoop in
 
07:22:11.810 --> 07:22:11.820 align:start position:0%
overbid take the homes and rent them
 
07:22:11.820 --> 07:22:12.948 align:start position:0%
overbid take the homes and rent them
forever

07:22:12.948 --> 07:22:12.958 align:start position:0%
forever
 
07:22:15.590 --> 07:22:15.600 align:start position:0%
I know full well that the forces of the
 
07:22:19.090 --> 07:22:19.100 align:start position:0%
privileged flu few excuse me
 
07:22:23.270 --> 07:22:23.280 align:start position:0%
it's gonna come out privileged few and
 
07:22:24.708 --> 07:22:24.718 align:start position:0%
the special interests will come out in
 
07:22:27.468 --> 07:22:27.478 align:start position:0%
full force against this good legislation
 
07:22:29.930 --> 07:22:29.940 align:start position:0%
to paraphrase president uh Franklin
 
07:22:33.170 --> 07:22:33.180 align:start position:0%
Roosevelt they may be unanimous in their
 
07:22:35.570 --> 07:22:35.580 align:start position:0%
hate for this bill but I welcome that
 
07:22:35.580 --> 07:22:36.468 align:start position:0%
hate for this bill but I welcome that
hatred

07:22:36.468 --> 07:22:36.478 align:start position:0%
hatred
 
07:22:38.208 --> 07:22:38.218 align:start position:0%
by passing this law today and
 
07:22:40.250 --> 07:22:40.260 align:start position:0%
overturning the itl we will be saying
 
07:22:42.890 --> 07:22:42.900 align:start position:0%
loudly and firmly that we prioritize
 
07:22:45.830 --> 07:22:45.840 align:start position:0%
real people over corporations and we
 
07:22:49.070 --> 07:22:49.080 align:start position:0%
believe that in in a New Hampshire and
 
07:22:51.230 --> 07:22:51.240 align:start position:0%
in America where home ownership is a
 
07:22:51.240 --> 07:22:52.368 align:start position:0%
in America where home ownership is a
reality

07:22:52.368 --> 07:22:52.378 align:start position:0%
reality
 
07:22:55.070 --> 07:22:55.080 align:start position:0%
and the American dream May so endure for
 
07:22:57.650 --> 07:22:57.660 align:start position:0%
the Next Generation the
 
07:23:00.948 --> 07:23:00.958 align:start position:0%
and I would like a division vote please
 
07:23:02.690 --> 07:23:02.700 align:start position:0%
the jail recognizes representative
 
07:23:02.700 --> 07:23:05.930 align:start position:0%
the jail recognizes representative

07:23:08.810 --> 07:23:08.820 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker colleagues House
 
07:23:11.030 --> 07:23:11.040 align:start position:0%
Bill 340 would seek to restrict the
 
07:23:13.070 --> 07:23:13.080 align:start position:0%
acquisition of single and multi-family
 
07:23:15.350 --> 07:23:15.360 align:start position:0%

certain exceptions
 
07:23:18.770 --> 07:23:18.780 align:start position:0%

07:23:20.750 --> 07:23:20.760 align:start position:0%
person that acquires single or
 
07:23:22.548 --> 07:23:22.558 align:start position:0%
multi-family property within one of the

provisions in this extreme proposal
 
07:23:45.890 --> 07:23:45.900 align:start position:0%
would generate violation referrals to
 
07:23:47.750 --> 07:23:47.760 align:start position:0%
the Attorney General's office for
 
07:23:49.670 --> 07:23:49.680 align:start position:0%
enforcement which ultimately could
 
07:23:52.190 --> 07:23:52.200 align:start position:0%
result in The uncompensated Taking of

unnecessary burden on property owners
 
07:24:02.150 --> 07:24:02.160 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr Speaker if I know that home
 
07:26:02.690 --> 07:26:02.700 align:start position:0%
ownership is one of the cornerstones of
 
07:26:05.150 --> 07:26:05.160 align:start position:0%
the American dream and if I know that
 
07:26:07.190 --> 07:26:07.200 align:start position:0%
corporate conglomerates like BlackRock
 
07:26:09.350 --> 07:26:09.360 align:start position:0%
and other financial institutions are
 
07:26:11.390 --> 07:26:11.400 align:start position:0%
buying up homes across New Hampshire to
 
07:26:14.208 --> 07:26:14.218 align:start position:0%
rent them in perpetuity pricing families
 
07:26:16.310 --> 07:26:16.320 align:start position:0%
out of the market and creating false
 
07:26:18.830 --> 07:26:18.840 align:start position:0%
inflation in the market and if I know
 
07:26:21.890 --> 07:26:21.900 align:start position:0%
that before us here today is a bill that
 
07:26:23.868 --> 07:26:23.878 align:start position:0%
bans corporations from stealing homes
 
07:26:26.510 --> 07:26:26.520 align:start position:0%
from families while keeping in place all
 
07:26:28.610 --> 07:26:28.620 align:start position:0%
the exceptions necessary to ensure the
 
07:26:30.890 --> 07:26:30.900 align:start position:0%
continuity of trusts mortgages and
 
07:26:30.900 --> 07:26:32.090 align:start position:0%
continuity of trusts mortgages and
renovations

07:26:32.090 --> 07:26:32.100 align:start position:0%
renovations
 
07:26:34.850 --> 07:26:34.860 align:start position:0%
and lastly if I know if we don't take
 
07:26:36.948 --> 07:26:36.958 align:start position:0%
action now to save Homes corporate
 
07:26:38.448 --> 07:26:38.458 align:start position:0%
ownership of the housing market will
 
07:26:40.910 --> 07:26:40.920 align:start position:0%
only grow into another 2008 scenario
 
07:26:43.128 --> 07:26:43.138 align:start position:0%
running the risk of vanquishing the
 
07:26:44.448 --> 07:26:44.458 align:start position:0%
Eternal Light Of Hope for a better
 
07:26:46.670 --> 07:26:46.680 align:start position:0%
future for your family and America would
 
07:26:49.430 --> 07:26:49.440 align:start position:0%
I now push the red button to save our
 
07:26:52.070 --> 07:26:52.080 align:start position:0%

07:27:17.930 --> 07:27:17.940 align:start position:0%
the provision set forth in House Bill
 
07:27:20.030 --> 07:27:20.040 align:start position:0%
340 could ultimately result in a
 
07:27:22.128 --> 07:27:22.138 align:start position:0%
transferral of said property to the
 
07:27:24.170 --> 07:27:24.180 align:start position:0%
political subdivision in which it's
 
07:27:26.448 --> 07:27:26.458 align:start position:0%
located by an uncompensated taking the
 
07:27:29.448 --> 07:27:29.458 align:start position:0%
equivalent of a 100 tax on an asset that
 
07:27:31.430 --> 07:27:31.440 align:start position:0%
could be worth millions for a violation
 
07:27:34.250 --> 07:27:34.260 align:start position:0%
of the statute and Mr Speaker if I know
 
07:27:36.770 --> 07:27:36.780 align:start position:0%
