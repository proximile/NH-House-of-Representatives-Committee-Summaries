00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 align:start position:0%
on one of the sponsors representative
 
00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.550 align:start position:0%
on one of the sponsors representative
emmerich

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair my name is Tracy
 
00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 align:start position:0%
Emrick I represent Hampton which is
 
00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:02.519 align:start position:0%
Rockingham District 29. I'm here uh for
 
00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 align:start position:0%
Tom Buco who was the primary sponsor he
 
00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 align:start position:0%
was afraid he was going to be snowed in
 
00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 align:start position:0%
I don't know if he is or not in Conway
 
00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:09.830 align:start position:0%
I don't know if he is or not in Conway
but

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640 align:start position:0%
he decided I said well if you can't make
 
00:03:13.449 --> 00:03:13.459 align:start position:0%
it I'll be glad to do it for you
 
00:03:17.089 --> 00:03:17.099 align:start position:0%
what this bill is is basically a belt
 
00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:18.560 align:start position:0%
and a suspenders
 
00:03:22.309 --> 00:03:22.319 align:start position:0%
when I came on finance my first year Tom
 
00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:24.300 align:start position:0%
Buco introduced a bill very similar to
 
00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 align:start position:0%
this and he did every turn every year
 
00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 align:start position:0%
for six years and in division one we
 
00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 align:start position:0%
started referring to it as Buco bucks
 
00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:37.080 align:start position:0%
because it was he was like a recurring
 
00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:38.640 align:start position:0%
nightmare with these with this
 
00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:42.239 align:start position:0%
ultimately what was happening is uh
 
00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:44.700 align:start position:0%
payments were coming delayed from the
 
00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:46.920 align:start position:0%
state and so what Tom did is he wanted
 
00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:48.239 align:start position:0%
to put it in a bill to make sure the
 
00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 align:start position:0%
payments were made in a timely fashion
 
00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:54.360 align:start position:0%
my understanding is now we're up to date
 
00:03:56.809 --> 00:03:56.819 align:start position:0%
so he still wants to have the suspenders
 
00:03:59.630 --> 00:03:59.640 align:start position:0%
in a belt to have legislation that says
 
00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:01.500 align:start position:0%
yes you will pay in a timely fashion
 
00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:03.540 align:start position:0%
those things which the state owes cities
 
00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:06.840 align:start position:0%
and towns that's what this is it's uh
 
00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:10.140 align:start position:0%
two years 15 million dollars you can see
 
00:04:13.369 --> 00:04:13.379 align:start position:0%
in the fiscal note that one year it's
 
00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:15.480 align:start position:0%
looks like this would be a little too
 
00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:16.919 align:start position:0%
much in another year it looks like it'd
 
00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:19.260 align:start position:0%
be a little too little but that that's
 
00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:21.000 align:start position:0%
basically what the Bill's about is so
 
00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:23.340 align:start position:0%
cities and towns in their wastewater
 
00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:24.249 align:start position:0%
cities and towns in their wastewater
treatment

00:04:24.249 --> 00:04:24.259 align:start position:0%
treatment
 
00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:27.540 align:start position:0%
updates uh can be compensated in a
 
00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:29.040 align:start position:0%
timely manner
 
00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:31.320 align:start position:0%
and I just told you all I know but I'll
 
00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:33.060 align:start position:0%
be glad to try to answer questions even
 
00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:36.180 align:start position:0%
though I I'll look like a deer in a
 
00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:39.050 align:start position:0%
though I I'll look like a deer in a
headlights

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:39.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:41.040 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire is recognized for
 
00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:42.780 align:start position:0%
a question thank you Mr chairman thank
 
00:04:44.749 --> 00:04:44.759 align:start position:0%
you representative when you say this is
 
00:04:46.969 --> 00:04:46.979 align:start position:0%
Belton suspenders do you mean to say
 
00:04:49.189 --> 00:04:49.199 align:start position:0%
that somehow this money is in the budget
 
00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:51.660 align:start position:0%
twice or this bill plus it's in the
 
00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:53.820 align:start position:0%
budget or something like that
 
00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:55.870 align:start position:0%
budget or something like that
yes

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:55.880 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:04:59.150 --> 00:04:59.160 align:start position:0%
it is this this these monies are
 
00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:02.340 align:start position:0%
budgeted by Des as part of their budget
 
00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:04.740 align:start position:0%
what this does is make sure that they'll
 
00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:06.540 align:start position:0%
expend it
 
00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:08.340 align:start position:0%
because in the past years while even
 
00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:10.320 align:start position:0%
though it was budgeted it was not
 
00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:12.720 align:start position:0%
expended it didn't forward the funds to
 
00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:14.880 align:start position:0%
the cities and towns for whatever reason
 
00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:17.220 align:start position:0%
and all this is is
 
00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:19.380 align:start position:0%
I'll call it insurance policy it sounds
 
00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:20.960 align:start position:0%
less dramatic
 
00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:24.240 align:start position:0%
so so if this passes it doesn't mean
 
00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:26.460 align:start position:0%
they'll spend twice as much on this item
 
00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:30.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:33.469 --> 00:05:33.479 align:start position:0%
there's a representative Miller for a
 
00:05:35.689 --> 00:05:35.699 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
00:05:38.689 --> 00:05:38.699 align:start position:0%
you for taking a question in um in
 
00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:40.620 align:start position:0%
reading the language of the bill it
 
00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:42.120 align:start position:0%
doesn't seem to require it to be spent
 
00:05:44.749 --> 00:05:44.759 align:start position:0%
it just appropriates it so I'm just not
 
00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:46.740 align:start position:0%
sure how it achieves the goal that you
 
00:05:48.409 --> 00:05:48.419 align:start position:0%
described which is to make the
 
00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:50.940 align:start position:0%
department make the payments and you
 
00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:53.460 align:start position:0%
know do all that I didn't write the bill
 
00:05:56.029 --> 00:05:56.039 align:start position:0%
I I I I'll have to defer to people who
 
00:05:57.590 --> 00:05:57.600 align:start position:0%
are smarter with this than I am we'll
 
00:05:59.510 --> 00:05:59.520 align:start position:0%
catch on it later thank you thank you Mr
 
00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:02.930 align:start position:0%
catch on it later thank you thank you Mr
chair

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:02.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:04.969 --> 00:06:04.979 align:start position:0%
any further questions from the committee
 
00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:06.720 align:start position:0%
members seeing none thank you
 
00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:08.220 align:start position:0%
representative Emrick
 
00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:11.160 align:start position:0%
we'll next call on representative excuse
 
00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:13.620 align:start position:0%
me Mr Boyd Smith from New Hampshire
 
00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:27.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:30.000 align:start position:0%
uh good morning chairman Weiler and uh
 
00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:32.160 align:start position:0%
thanks for the time and good morning to
 
00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:34.020 align:start position:0%
the committee members my name is Boyd
 
00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:35.460 align:start position:0%
Smith I'm the director of the New
 
00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:38.100 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Water Works Association and
 
00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:42.800 align:start position:0%
what we do is represent over 300
 
00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:46.680 align:start position:0%
members that provide drinking water most
 
00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:48.300 align:start position:0%
public drinking water in the state of
 
00:06:50.809 --> 00:06:50.819 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire we're in support of this
 
00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:53.100 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation although I realize
 
00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:54.720 align:start position:0%
it's it sounds like there's still some
 
00:06:56.570 --> 00:06:56.580 align:start position:0%
questions around it that uh I may not be
 
00:06:59.029 --> 00:06:59.039 align:start position:0%
able to answer but um we're in support
 
00:07:01.189 --> 00:07:01.199 align:start position:0%
of it because a number of our our
 
00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:03.600 align:start position:0%
systems a lot of systems in New
 
00:07:07.570 --> 00:07:07.580 align:start position:0%
Hampshire have both clean water uh
 
00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:10.500 align:start position:0%
provision and they also treat waste
 
00:07:12.469 --> 00:07:12.479 align:start position:0%
water this particular bill as I
 
00:07:13.909 --> 00:07:13.919 align:start position:0%
understand it
 
00:07:17.029 --> 00:07:17.039 align:start position:0%
is a commitment from the state
 
00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:18.840 align:start position:0%
or honoring a commitment from the state
 
00:07:22.010 --> 00:07:22.020 align:start position:0%
under an existing statute to be part of
 
00:07:25.730 --> 00:07:25.740 align:start position:0%
the funding mix for municipalities that
 
00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:28.500 align:start position:0%
are building Wastewater systems as
 
00:07:32.110 --> 00:07:32.120 align:start position:0%
approved basically by nhdes
 
00:07:35.029 --> 00:07:35.039 align:start position:0%
you probably know there's a number of
 
00:07:37.309 --> 00:07:37.319 align:start position:0%
sources for funding these big projects
 
00:07:39.050 --> 00:07:39.060 align:start position:0%
they're very expensive multi-million
 
00:07:40.930 --> 00:07:40.940 align:start position:0%
dollars multiple years
 
00:07:44.029 --> 00:07:44.039 align:start position:0%
and you know we usually get big boosts
 
00:07:45.830 --> 00:07:45.840 align:start position:0%
from the federal government to do
 
00:07:49.249 --> 00:07:49.259 align:start position:0%
Capital Improvement on infrastructure it
 
00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:51.000 align:start position:0%
hasn't happened for 40 years but it's
 
00:07:53.450 --> 00:07:53.460 align:start position:0%
happening now you know with the the arpa
 
00:07:55.129 --> 00:07:55.139 align:start position:0%
money and the bil money so we've got a
 
00:07:57.650 --> 00:07:57.660 align:start position:0%
big influx of cash from the feds to
 
00:07:59.870 --> 00:07:59.880 align:start position:0%
update infrastructure that much of it's
 
00:08:02.029 --> 00:08:02.039 align:start position:0%
four decades old and it's past the point
 
00:08:04.550 --> 00:08:04.560 align:start position:0%
of failure as you can imagine we can't
 
00:08:06.170 --> 00:08:06.180 align:start position:0%
afford to have our waste water and
 
00:08:07.909 --> 00:08:07.919 align:start position:0%
drinking water systems fail
 
00:08:11.450 --> 00:08:11.460 align:start position:0%
so this piece of funding from uh that's
 
00:08:14.930 --> 00:08:14.940 align:start position:0%
being requested in this bill is uh part
 
00:08:17.089 --> 00:08:17.099 align:start position:0%
of as I understand it a promise from an
 
00:08:19.369 --> 00:08:19.379 align:start position:0%
irsa I think it's 486 it's been in place
 
00:08:20.689 --> 00:08:20.699 align:start position:0%
for a long time
 
00:08:23.930 --> 00:08:23.940 align:start position:0%
and that that calls for the state to you
 
00:08:26.629 --> 00:08:26.639 align:start position:0%
know to be a part of the funding source
 
00:08:29.749 --> 00:08:29.759 align:start position:0%
and this 15 million dollars uh per year
 
00:08:31.909 --> 00:08:31.919 align:start position:0%
roughly that you're looking at is a
 
00:08:33.050 --> 00:08:33.060 align:start position:0%
number that's been pretty well
 
00:08:36.050 --> 00:08:36.060 align:start position:0%
calculated based on need of projects
 
00:08:37.790 --> 00:08:37.800 align:start position:0%
approved by Des and again there's
 
00:08:39.170 --> 00:08:39.180 align:start position:0%
smarter people than I could get into
 
00:08:40.730 --> 00:08:40.740 align:start position:0%
those details if you want but it's a
 
00:08:43.490 --> 00:08:43.500 align:start position:0%
well-justified need following a process
 
00:08:47.210 --> 00:08:47.220 align:start position:0%
that that Des uses for uh you know most
 
00:08:49.970 --> 00:08:49.980 align:start position:0%
federal funding the srf and Etc
 
00:08:53.690 --> 00:08:53.700 align:start position:0%
and it helps it helps towns pay off you
 
00:08:55.910 --> 00:08:55.920 align:start position:0%
know that carry their debt so imagine
 
00:08:58.070 --> 00:08:58.080 align:start position:0%
you know most of our municipalities are
 
00:08:59.690 --> 00:08:59.700 align:start position:0%
towns they've got a town meeting you
 
00:09:00.949 --> 00:09:00.959 align:start position:0%
know they meet in March there's a
 
00:09:03.769 --> 00:09:03.779 align:start position:0%
warrant article for a bond to you know
 
00:09:05.389 --> 00:09:05.399 align:start position:0%
to borrow whatever three million dollars
 
00:09:07.910 --> 00:09:07.920 align:start position:0%
five million dollars for a necessary
 
00:09:10.130 --> 00:09:10.140 align:start position:0%
infrastructure project they figure that
 
00:09:12.290 --> 00:09:12.300 align:start position:0%
they're going to get 15 you know sorry
 
00:09:14.269 --> 00:09:14.279 align:start position:0%
about 20 percent assistance from the
 
00:09:17.090 --> 00:09:17.100 align:start position:0%
state on their principle and and loan to
 
00:09:20.210 --> 00:09:20.220 align:start position:0%
manage their debt and then they don't
 
00:09:22.730 --> 00:09:22.740 align:start position:0%
see it and my understanding is it's not
 
00:09:24.530 --> 00:09:24.540 align:start position:0%
so much a timing thing or a des thing
 
00:09:26.810 --> 00:09:26.820 align:start position:0%
it's been an it's been a budgetary
 
00:09:28.670 --> 00:09:28.680 align:start position:0%
allocation that some years it gets
 
00:09:31.190 --> 00:09:31.200 align:start position:0%
allocated some years it doesn't
 
00:09:35.449 --> 00:09:35.459 align:start position:0%
um so having a Dependable source of
 
00:09:35.459 --> 00:09:36.910 align:start position:0%
um so having a Dependable source of
funds

00:09:36.910 --> 00:09:36.920 align:start position:0%
funds
 
00:09:39.949 --> 00:09:39.959 align:start position:0%
helps towns to talk to their citizens
 
00:09:41.570 --> 00:09:41.580 align:start position:0%
and say you know get ready we're going
 
00:09:43.910 --> 00:09:43.920 align:start position:0%
to pick up a bond for 20 years for
 
00:09:46.130 --> 00:09:46.140 align:start position:0%
something that we all count on but we
 
00:09:47.509 --> 00:09:47.519 align:start position:0%
pretty much take for granted and don't
 
00:09:47.519 --> 00:09:49.310 align:start position:0%
pretty much take for granted and don't
understand

00:09:49.310 --> 00:09:49.320 align:start position:0%
understand
 
00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:50.590 align:start position:0%
understand
um

00:09:50.590 --> 00:09:50.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:54.710 --> 00:09:54.720 align:start position:0%
so I think you all know uh that uh this
 
00:09:57.949 --> 00:09:57.959 align:start position:0%
is important to have we need toilets
 
00:09:59.570 --> 00:09:59.580 align:start position:0%
that flush somewhere we need drinking
 
00:10:02.690 --> 00:10:02.700 align:start position:0%
water that comes out clean I think a
 
00:10:05.389 --> 00:10:05.399 align:start position:0%
regular this this 15 million dollar that
 
00:10:07.790 --> 00:10:07.800 align:start position:0%
proposed my understanding is as a
 
00:10:10.850 --> 00:10:10.860 align:start position:0%
baseline moving forward you know like as
 
00:10:14.870 --> 00:10:14.880 align:start position:0%
is Promised in the statute is a a very
 
00:10:16.730 --> 00:10:16.740 align:start position:0%
helpful meaningful and we hope
 
00:10:19.370 --> 00:10:19.380 align:start position:0%
reasonable balance of the state's
 
00:10:19.380 --> 00:10:20.829 align:start position:0%
reasonable balance of the state's
commitment

00:10:20.829 --> 00:10:20.839 align:start position:0%
commitment
 
00:10:23.509 --> 00:10:23.519 align:start position:0%
to the towns it's it's money well spent
 
00:10:26.389 --> 00:10:26.399 align:start position:0%
so um thank you very much for the time
 
00:10:28.430 --> 00:10:28.440 align:start position:0%
I'll answer any questions you have if I
 
00:10:30.350 --> 00:10:30.360 align:start position:0%
can and if I can't I'll get back to you
 
00:10:33.110 --> 00:10:33.120 align:start position:0%
as soon as possible with answers
 
00:10:37.550 --> 00:10:37.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:41.030 --> 00:10:41.040 align:start position:0%
seeing none I have one these things that
 
00:10:44.090 --> 00:10:44.100 align:start position:0%
have been added recently like pfast
 
00:10:47.030 --> 00:10:47.040 align:start position:0%
what sort of equipment has to be added
 
00:10:48.889 --> 00:10:48.899 align:start position:0%
to all these places that already had
 
00:10:51.290 --> 00:10:51.300 align:start position:0%
water treatment plants does this bring
 
00:10:54.170 --> 00:10:54.180 align:start position:0%
on a whole new set of equipment that has
 
00:10:57.110 --> 00:10:57.120 align:start position:0%
to be added or what what sort of
 
00:10:59.690 --> 00:10:59.700 align:start position:0%
mechanical stuff is added here yeah
 
00:11:02.210 --> 00:11:02.220 align:start position:0%
that's a great question and and frankly
 
00:11:04.069 --> 00:11:04.079 align:start position:0%
the drinking water and wastewater people
 
00:11:06.290 --> 00:11:06.300 align:start position:0%
uh in New Hampshire and anywhere
 
00:11:08.750 --> 00:11:08.760 align:start position:0%
impacted by pfas are really scratching
 
00:11:10.910 --> 00:11:10.920 align:start position:0%
their heads over it it the short answer
 
00:11:13.130 --> 00:11:13.140 align:start position:0%
is it's going to be more money under the
 
00:11:15.650 --> 00:11:15.660 align:start position:0%
current standards we're just New
 
00:11:17.210 --> 00:11:17.220 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has drinking water standards
 
00:11:20.090 --> 00:11:20.100 align:start position:0%
for pfas we're anticipating even tighter
 
00:11:22.610 --> 00:11:22.620 align:start position:0%
standards to be proposed by EPA you know
 
00:11:22.620 --> 00:11:23.449 align:start position:0%
standards to be proposed by EPA you know
soon

00:11:23.449 --> 00:11:23.459 align:start position:0%
soon
 
00:11:25.850 --> 00:11:25.860 align:start position:0%
challenge with Wastewater is we're still
 
00:11:29.509 --> 00:11:29.519 align:start position:0%
working on analytical test methods to
 
00:11:31.370 --> 00:11:31.380 align:start position:0%
deter you know to to find out what the
 
00:11:32.990 --> 00:11:33.000 align:start position:0%
concentrations are and then you have to
 
00:11:35.990 --> 00:11:36.000 align:start position:0%
determine how much uh in say biosolage
 
00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:37.670 align:start position:0%
determine how much uh in say biosolage
residuals

00:11:37.670 --> 00:11:37.680 align:start position:0%
residuals
 
00:11:40.850 --> 00:11:40.860 align:start position:0%
um is too much to prevent leaching uh
 
00:11:42.530 --> 00:11:42.540 align:start position:0%
into the ground or wherever you dump it
 
00:11:43.850 --> 00:11:43.860 align:start position:0%
because you have to have a place to dump
 
00:11:45.769 --> 00:11:45.779 align:start position:0%
it so we're dealing with what do you do
 
00:11:48.710 --> 00:11:48.720 align:start position:0%
with uh you know these waste streams so
 
00:11:51.350 --> 00:11:51.360 align:start position:0%
to get the short answer is it's going to
 
00:11:52.910 --> 00:11:52.920 align:start position:0%
be complicated we don't have all the
 
00:11:54.530 --> 00:11:54.540 align:start position:0%
answers now and it's absolutely going to
 
00:11:57.530 --> 00:11:57.540 align:start position:0%
cost much more money to deal with pfas
 
00:12:00.410 --> 00:12:00.420 align:start position:0%
the way it's evolving now is it possible
 
00:12:02.030 --> 00:12:02.040 align:start position:0%
that the equipment hasn't even been
 
00:12:03.590 --> 00:12:03.600 align:start position:0%
developed that can get to the
 
00:12:05.990 --> 00:12:06.000 align:start position:0%
ridiculously low level that they have
 
00:12:08.389 --> 00:12:08.399 align:start position:0%
set on this
 
00:12:11.750 --> 00:12:11.760 align:start position:0%
I I don't know I mean my experience is
 
00:12:12.949 --> 00:12:12.959 align:start position:0%
if you've got enough money you can
 
00:12:15.710 --> 00:12:15.720 align:start position:0%
pretty much fix everything but uh I I'm
 
00:12:18.710 --> 00:12:18.720 align:start position:0%
not familiar with the technology uh that
 
00:12:20.750 --> 00:12:20.760 align:start position:0%
that would do that I thought maybe
 
00:12:23.509 --> 00:12:23.519 align:start position:0%
that's where your expertise layer no I'm
 
00:12:25.670 --> 00:12:25.680 align:start position:0%
a groundwater Lake water drinking water
 
00:12:27.889 --> 00:12:27.899 align:start position:0%
kind of guy yeah all right
 
00:12:29.389 --> 00:12:29.399 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee
 
00:12:31.670 --> 00:12:31.680 align:start position:0%
representative papovichi Muller thank
 
00:12:33.170 --> 00:12:33.180 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and thank you for taking
 
00:12:34.430 --> 00:12:34.440 align:start position:0%
our questions
 
00:12:36.470 --> 00:12:36.480 align:start position:0%
basically the way you describe it the
 
00:12:38.690 --> 00:12:38.700 align:start position:0%
purpose of this bill is to help towns
 
00:12:41.329 --> 00:12:41.339 align:start position:0%
afford you know projects that may not
 
00:12:43.310 --> 00:12:43.320 align:start position:0%
otherwise have afforded by you know
 
00:12:45.470 --> 00:12:45.480 align:start position:0%
having other
 
00:12:47.509 --> 00:12:47.519 align:start position:0%
State residents sharing to the cost of
 
00:12:50.269 --> 00:12:50.279 align:start position:0%
it could you explain a little bit more
 
00:12:52.610 --> 00:12:52.620 align:start position:0%
why we need to bring funds from other
 
00:12:54.889 --> 00:12:54.899 align:start position:0%
towns who don't benefit from those Works
 
00:12:56.930 --> 00:12:56.940 align:start position:0%
to help the towns that do sure yeah
 
00:12:58.310 --> 00:12:58.320 align:start position:0%
that's a great question I'm sure it
 
00:12:59.990 --> 00:13:00.000 align:start position:0%
comes up all the time you know you hear
 
00:13:01.670 --> 00:13:01.680 align:start position:0%
a local issue and then what's the
 
00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:03.170 align:start position:0%
a local issue and then what's the
benefit

00:13:03.170 --> 00:13:03.180 align:start position:0%
benefit
 
00:13:05.590 --> 00:13:05.600 align:start position:0%
um I I think
 
00:13:08.090 --> 00:13:08.100 align:start position:0%
I'll take a shot at this I mean that's a
 
00:13:10.250 --> 00:13:10.260 align:start position:0%
good question for our Economist
 
00:13:12.710 --> 00:13:12.720 align:start position:0%
um we are small uh towns scattered all
 
00:13:14.329 --> 00:13:14.339 align:start position:0%
over the state
 
00:13:16.970 --> 00:13:16.980 align:start position:0%
but we are interdependent
 
00:13:19.310 --> 00:13:19.320 align:start position:0%
um you know people move they live in one
 
00:13:21.829 --> 00:13:21.839 align:start position:0%
town they work in another if they have
 
00:13:23.569 --> 00:13:23.579 align:start position:0%
any kind of a tourist base folks are
 
00:13:25.910 --> 00:13:25.920 align:start position:0%
coming in to you know to stay out of
 
00:13:27.710 --> 00:13:27.720 align:start position:0%
town a b and b a restaurant you know
 
00:13:30.230 --> 00:13:30.240 align:start position:0%
open a business we move around we're not
 
00:13:32.810 --> 00:13:32.820 align:start position:0%
Islands within you know within our state
 
00:13:35.269 --> 00:13:35.279 align:start position:0%
borders and
 
00:13:37.069 --> 00:13:37.079 align:start position:0%
at some point I guess this is kind of
 
00:13:38.389 --> 00:13:38.399 align:start position:0%
the question about what's the purpose of
 
00:13:40.970 --> 00:13:40.980 align:start position:0%
government you know at what point do you
 
00:13:44.329 --> 00:13:44.339 align:start position:0%
um you know uh take from some people to
 
00:13:46.310 --> 00:13:46.320 align:start position:0%
give to others I would say when you're
 
00:13:48.470 --> 00:13:48.480 align:start position:0%
dealing with drinking water and waste
 
00:13:49.790 --> 00:13:49.800 align:start position:0%
water which is what this bill's talking
 
00:13:52.190 --> 00:13:52.200 align:start position:0%
about waste water that it truly is a
 
00:13:54.350 --> 00:13:54.360 align:start position:0%
universal issue and it's also I think
 
00:13:56.329 --> 00:13:56.339 align:start position:0%
it's like the type of projects that um
 
00:13:58.250 --> 00:13:58.260 align:start position:0%
you know they're too big you see someone
 
00:14:00.110 --> 00:14:00.120 align:start position:0%
might need a system and we see a lot of
 
00:14:01.790 --> 00:14:01.800 align:start position:0%
very very small systems in New Hampshire
 
00:14:04.430 --> 00:14:04.440 align:start position:0%
that have they can't afford to do any of
 
00:14:06.350 --> 00:14:06.360 align:start position:0%
this stuff so
 
00:14:08.389 --> 00:14:08.399 align:start position:0%
um on the drinking water side there's
 
00:14:11.030 --> 00:14:11.040 align:start position:0%
over 2000 regulated systems only 50
 
00:14:13.670 --> 00:14:13.680 align:start position:0%
serve more than 3 000 people you know so
 
00:14:16.670 --> 00:14:16.680 align:start position:0%
50 of them serve I don't know 50 of the
 
00:14:18.470 --> 00:14:18.480 align:start position:0%
state population the other two thousand
 
00:14:20.629 --> 00:14:20.639 align:start position:0%
the other you know four percent that's
 
00:14:23.210 --> 00:14:23.220 align:start position:0%
covered so I I think it's a fill in some
 
00:14:24.829 --> 00:14:24.839 align:start position:0%
ways a philosophical but I think there's
 
00:14:27.050 --> 00:14:27.060 align:start position:0%
strong economic reasons to invest in the
 
00:14:28.490 --> 00:14:28.500 align:start position:0%
quality of drinking water and wastewater
 
00:14:29.990 --> 00:14:30.000 align:start position:0%
everywhere there's a facility being
 
00:14:33.530 --> 00:14:33.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:36.590 --> 00:14:36.600 align:start position:0%
further questions from committee members
 
00:14:39.230 --> 00:14:39.240 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you Mr Boyd thank you
 
00:14:41.030 --> 00:14:41.040 align:start position:0%
very much for your time and I apologize
 
00:14:43.670 --> 00:14:43.680 align:start position:0%
for Miss uh addressing my testimony
 
00:14:45.650 --> 00:14:45.660 align:start position:0%
letter to you I got ahead of myself a
 
00:14:46.790 --> 00:14:46.800 align:start position:0%
little bit and I'm kind of new at the
 
00:14:49.129 --> 00:14:49.139 align:start position:0%
game everybody now has a copy okay good
 
00:14:50.750 --> 00:14:50.760 align:start position:0%
thank you sir
 
00:14:53.569 --> 00:14:53.579 align:start position:0%
it's in the streets
 
00:14:55.970 --> 00:14:55.980 align:start position:0%
the next call upon Catherine Heck from
 
00:14:55.980 --> 00:15:05.030 align:start position:0%
the next call upon Catherine Heck from
nhma

00:15:05.030 --> 00:15:05.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:06.769 --> 00:15:06.779 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr chairman and members of
 
00:15:08.449 --> 00:15:08.459 align:start position:0%
the committee my name is Catherine heck
 
00:15:09.829 --> 00:15:09.839 align:start position:0%
and I represent the New Hampshire
 
00:15:12.110 --> 00:15:12.120 align:start position:0%
Municipal Association the cities and
 
00:15:13.490 --> 00:15:13.500 align:start position:0%
towns here in New Hampshire and I don't
 
00:15:15.290 --> 00:15:15.300 align:start position:0%
want to repeat any testimony that you've
 
00:15:17.449 --> 00:15:17.459 align:start position:0%
already heard as to why these dollars
 
00:15:19.370 --> 00:15:19.380 align:start position:0%
are important and we continue our
 
00:15:21.410 --> 00:15:21.420 align:start position:0%
partnership with the state I would like
 
00:15:23.689 --> 00:15:23.699 align:start position:0%
to add however that as we're looking at
 
00:15:25.550 --> 00:15:25.560 align:start position:0%
things like expanding housing and
 
00:15:27.769 --> 00:15:27.779 align:start position:0%
housing availability access to public
 
00:15:30.769 --> 00:15:30.779 align:start position:0%
water and sewer become a very critical
 
00:15:33.949 --> 00:15:33.959 align:start position:0%
part of that expansion
 
00:15:36.650 --> 00:15:36.660 align:start position:0%
um into the housing area so we do know
 
00:15:39.370 --> 00:15:39.380 align:start position:0%
anecdotally that an upgrade to a major
 
00:15:42.110 --> 00:15:42.120 align:start position:0%
sewer system can be 20 to 40 million
 
00:15:44.449 --> 00:15:44.459 align:start position:0%
dollars we do know that a mile a pipe is
 
00:15:47.750 --> 00:15:47.760 align:start position:0%
1.2 to 1.4 million dollars for water and
 
00:15:50.509 --> 00:15:50.519 align:start position:0%
sewer pipe so these are huge expenses so
 
00:15:52.069 --> 00:15:52.079 align:start position:0%
as we're thinking about the housing
 
00:15:54.110 --> 00:15:54.120 align:start position:0%
crisis that we're experiencing and we
 
00:15:56.689 --> 00:15:56.699 align:start position:0%
want municipalities to be able to expand
 
00:15:59.810 --> 00:15:59.820 align:start position:0%
the ability to build affordable homes in
 
00:16:01.910 --> 00:16:01.920 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire we have to consider the
 
00:16:04.370 --> 00:16:04.380 align:start position:0%
access for the smaller lots to have on
 
00:16:06.710 --> 00:16:06.720 align:start position:0%
public water and sewer so I certainly
 
00:16:08.150 --> 00:16:08.160 align:start position:0%
can take any questions that you might
 
00:16:09.650 --> 00:16:09.660 align:start position:0%
have but I didn't want to repeat what
 
00:16:11.990 --> 00:16:12.000 align:start position:0%
was already said thank you
 
00:16:13.850 --> 00:16:13.860 align:start position:0%
thank you questions from committee
 
00:16:13.860 --> 00:16:15.350 align:start position:0%
thank you questions from committee
members

00:16:15.350 --> 00:16:15.360 align:start position:0%
members
 
00:16:17.629 --> 00:16:17.639 align:start position:0%
representative papavichi Miller thank
 
00:16:19.610 --> 00:16:19.620 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman and thanks Mrs hack for
 
00:16:21.530 --> 00:16:21.540 align:start position:0%
taking the questions different questions
 
00:16:23.449 --> 00:16:23.459 align:start position:0%
since you brought up housing
 
00:16:23.459 --> 00:16:26.150 align:start position:0%
since you brought up housing
availability

00:16:26.150 --> 00:16:26.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:29.150 --> 00:16:29.160 align:start position:0%
would you see a need to you know
 
00:16:32.990 --> 00:16:33.000 align:start position:0%
subsidize those things for just for the
 
00:16:35.030 --> 00:16:35.040 align:start position:0%
benefits to housing or are there any
 
00:16:37.310 --> 00:16:37.320 align:start position:0%
other other reasons because I can think
 
00:16:39.470 --> 00:16:39.480 align:start position:0%
of a lot of towns that water or not they
 
00:16:41.749 --> 00:16:41.759 align:start position:0%
just won't really allow a lot of housing
 
00:16:44.150 --> 00:16:44.160 align:start position:0%
so I'm just curious whether you see a
 
00:16:46.790 --> 00:16:46.800 align:start position:0%
tie in the way we allocate These funds
 
00:16:49.310 --> 00:16:49.320 align:start position:0%
given that you are you know using
 
00:16:50.509 --> 00:16:50.519 align:start position:0%
housing availability you know the
 
00:16:52.310 --> 00:16:52.320 align:start position:0%
ability to expand housing Supply as a
 
00:16:55.310 --> 00:16:55.320 align:start position:0%
reason so well I think that there's
 
00:16:57.829 --> 00:16:57.839 align:start position:0%
several issues I the housing challenge
 
00:17:00.350 --> 00:17:00.360 align:start position:0%
certainly is a town by Town situation
 
00:17:02.329 --> 00:17:02.339 align:start position:0%
and I know the state is working very
 
00:17:04.669 --> 00:17:04.679 align:start position:0%
hard on legislation that would enable
 
00:17:07.010 --> 00:17:07.020 align:start position:0%
municipalities to have more access to
 
00:17:09.289 --> 00:17:09.299 align:start position:0%
new dollars for things like water and
 
00:17:11.150 --> 00:17:11.160 align:start position:0%
sewer expansion because when we have
 
00:17:13.130 --> 00:17:13.140 align:start position:0%
small lot size and we have to build in
 
00:17:15.770 --> 00:17:15.780 align:start position:0%
density of course that you can't put a
 
00:17:17.870 --> 00:17:17.880 align:start position:0%
private well and a private septic tank
 
00:17:21.110 --> 00:17:21.120 align:start position:0%
in I am not a housing expert and I don't
 
00:17:23.150 --> 00:17:23.160 align:start position:0%
claim to be an economist there's
 
00:17:25.309 --> 00:17:25.319 align:start position:0%
certainly other benefits and some were
 
00:17:27.890 --> 00:17:27.900 align:start position:0%
touched upon in your last question about
 
00:17:27.900 --> 00:17:28.909 align:start position:0%
touched upon in your last question about
how

00:17:28.909 --> 00:17:28.919 align:start position:0%
how
 
00:17:31.430 --> 00:17:31.440 align:start position:0%
well we allocate money to say a project
 
00:17:33.289 --> 00:17:33.299 align:start position:0%
here in Concord they might be on the
 
00:17:35.810 --> 00:17:35.820 align:start position:0%
list how many of us come to Concord to
 
00:17:38.450 --> 00:17:38.460 align:start position:0%
to work to do our business to run state
 
00:17:40.310 --> 00:17:40.320 align:start position:0%
government we eat in their restaurant so
 
00:17:42.470 --> 00:17:42.480 align:start position:0%
of course we need that that clean access
 
00:17:45.289 --> 00:17:45.299 align:start position:0%
to water and sewer and those upgrades
 
00:17:46.850 --> 00:17:46.860 align:start position:0%
that haven't been done in many many
 
00:17:50.330 --> 00:17:50.340 align:start position:0%
years I think housing is just one other
 
00:17:52.610 --> 00:17:52.620 align:start position:0%
area that we have to consider and I know
 
00:17:55.789 --> 00:17:55.799 align:start position:0%
that currently the state has an invest
 
00:17:57.710 --> 00:17:57.720 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire program they are investing
 
00:18:01.370 --> 00:18:01.380 align:start position:0%
dollars into these types of
 
00:18:03.350 --> 00:18:03.360 align:start position:0%
studies and having municipalities
 
00:18:06.770 --> 00:18:06.780 align:start position:0%
rethink how they can better maximize the
 
00:18:08.330 --> 00:18:08.340 align:start position:0%
space that we do have so we can break
 
00:18:09.830 --> 00:18:09.840 align:start position:0%
down some of the barriers you're talking
 
00:18:12.409 --> 00:18:12.419 align:start position:0%
about in communities that say we just
 
00:18:15.409 --> 00:18:15.419 align:start position:0%
can't but it's very hard to build a
 
00:18:17.750 --> 00:18:17.760 align:start position:0%
fourplex on a half acre lot if there's
 
00:18:19.850 --> 00:18:19.860 align:start position:0%
no infrastructure to tie into for
 
00:18:23.750 --> 00:18:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:26.510 --> 00:18:26.520 align:start position:0%
further questions from committee members
 
00:18:28.490 --> 00:18:28.500 align:start position:0%
seeing none I have a question for you I
 
00:18:30.470 --> 00:18:30.480 align:start position:0%
read some time ago that the majority of
 
00:18:32.570 --> 00:18:32.580 align:start position:0%
the people in New Hampshire get their
 
00:18:34.730 --> 00:18:34.740 align:start position:0%
water from private Wells
 
00:18:37.549 --> 00:18:37.559 align:start position:0%
now you represent small towns as well as
 
00:18:40.789 --> 00:18:40.799 align:start position:0%
cities the small towns I represent the
 
00:18:43.669 --> 00:18:43.679 align:start position:0%
majority of people have private Wells
 
00:18:45.950 --> 00:18:45.960 align:start position:0%
they're not really and they have two
 
00:18:48.409 --> 00:18:48.419 align:start position:0%
acre lots by our zoning they're not
 
00:18:50.570 --> 00:18:50.580 align:start position:0%
crazy about having someone come in and
 
00:18:52.490 --> 00:18:52.500 align:start position:0%
cram more houses into smaller lots and
 
00:18:55.850 --> 00:18:55.860 align:start position:0%
have them pay for a water system they
 
00:18:58.010 --> 00:18:58.020 align:start position:0%
just as soon keep it the way it is and I
 
00:19:00.289 --> 00:19:00.299 align:start position:0%
think your organization has to recognize
 
00:19:00.299 --> 00:19:04.010 align:start position:0%
think your organization has to recognize
that

00:19:04.010 --> 00:19:04.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:06.830 --> 00:19:06.840 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure if there was a a question I
 
00:19:10.669 --> 00:19:10.679 align:start position:0%
do know that some small towns do have a
 
00:19:13.130 --> 00:19:13.140 align:start position:0%
small village district and anybody on
 
00:19:15.110 --> 00:19:15.120 align:start position:0%
public water and sewer is taxed
 
00:19:17.450 --> 00:19:17.460 align:start position:0%
separately for those services so if I'm
 
00:19:19.490 --> 00:19:19.500 align:start position:0%
on a private well like myself my
 
00:19:21.350 --> 00:19:21.360 align:start position:0%
downtown has access I'm in a town of
 
00:19:25.010 --> 00:19:25.020 align:start position:0%
1600 my downtown has access to public
 
00:19:26.570 --> 00:19:26.580 align:start position:0%
water and people can hook up to it
 
00:19:28.190 --> 00:19:28.200 align:start position:0%
however there's going to be a point in
 
00:19:31.010 --> 00:19:31.020 align:start position:0%
which the system is maximized because
 
00:19:33.350 --> 00:19:33.360 align:start position:0%
it's a very small system but I myself am
 
00:19:35.810 --> 00:19:35.820 align:start position:0%
on private water and sewer and you know
 
00:19:38.150 --> 00:19:38.160 align:start position:0%
well water and septic and I don't pay a
 
00:19:39.650 --> 00:19:39.660 align:start position:0%
separate tax bill
 
00:19:43.310 --> 00:19:43.320 align:start position:0%
um for that service so the users pay the
 
00:19:46.190 --> 00:19:46.200 align:start position:0%
fees associated with it and the way we
 
00:19:49.130 --> 00:19:49.140 align:start position:0%
structure it in New Hampshire so my my
 
00:19:51.770 --> 00:19:51.780 align:start position:0%
tax dollars are not going to that but I
 
00:19:53.750 --> 00:19:53.760 align:start position:0%
am able when I use the park or when I go
 
00:19:55.610 --> 00:19:55.620 align:start position:0%
to the town office or use the meeting
 
00:19:58.130 --> 00:19:58.140 align:start position:0%
house or the space is available to me as
 
00:20:00.049 --> 00:20:00.059 align:start position:0%
a member of the public I am able of
 
00:20:03.049 --> 00:20:03.059 align:start position:0%
course to flush the toilet get drinking
 
00:20:06.049 --> 00:20:06.059 align:start position:0%
water whatever the case may be
 
00:20:08.390 --> 00:20:08.400 align:start position:0%
thank you any further questions from
 
00:20:10.190 --> 00:20:10.200 align:start position:0%
committee members seeing none thank you
 
00:20:14.110 --> 00:20:14.120 align:start position:0%

and he's from acec New Hampshire he'll
 
00:20:27.289 --> 00:20:27.299 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:29.630 --> 00:20:29.640 align:start position:0%
good morning thank you Mr chair
 
00:20:31.669 --> 00:20:31.679 align:start position:0%
my name is Alex katrubis I'm here
 
00:20:33.830 --> 00:20:33.840 align:start position:0%

we're an association of about 70
 
00:20:42.529 --> 00:20:42.539 align:start position:0%
engineering firms who have offices
 
00:20:44.810 --> 00:20:44.820 align:start position:0%
throughout the state they employ about
 
00:20:47.270 --> 00:20:47.280 align:start position:0%
1500 New Hampshire residents many of our
 
00:20:50.210 --> 00:20:50.220 align:start position:0%
firms work with local municipalities on
 
00:20:52.669 --> 00:20:52.679 align:start position:0%
Wastewater infrastructure projects that
 
00:20:53.870 --> 00:20:53.880 align:start position:0%
as you've heard this morning are
 
00:20:56.029 --> 00:20:56.039 align:start position:0%
critically important for our citizens
 
00:20:58.010 --> 00:20:58.020 align:start position:0%
and our businesses in the state
 
00:21:00.370 --> 00:21:00.380 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire engineering firms provide
 
00:21:02.330 --> 00:21:02.340 align:start position:0%

to solve the complex challenges with
 
00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:10.850 align:start position:0%
to solve the complex challenges with
Wastewater

00:21:10.850 --> 00:21:10.860 align:start position:0%
Wastewater
 
00:21:12.289 --> 00:21:12.299 align:start position:0%
this program that we're talking about
 
00:21:16.490 --> 00:21:16.500 align:start position:0%
this morning it was founded in 1990 it's
 
00:21:18.289 --> 00:21:18.299 align:start position:0%
administered by Des as you've heard
 
00:21:20.029 --> 00:21:20.039 align:start position:0%
since that time it's been a really
 
00:21:22.190 --> 00:21:22.200 align:start position:0%
important funding tool for New Hampshire
 
00:21:24.169 --> 00:21:24.179 align:start position:0%
cities and towns and without this
 
00:21:26.210 --> 00:21:26.220 align:start position:0%
program a lot of the medium-sized
 
00:21:27.350 --> 00:21:27.360 align:start position:0%
communities in the state probably
 
00:21:29.810 --> 00:21:29.820 align:start position:0%
couldn't afford to invest in some of
 
00:21:31.390 --> 00:21:31.400 align:start position:0%
these projects as you all know
 
00:21:33.710 --> 00:21:33.720 align:start position:0%
municipalities basically only have the
 
00:21:35.750 --> 00:21:35.760 align:start position:0%
property tax and maybe the registration
 
00:21:38.210 --> 00:21:38.220 align:start position:0%
fee but the state has a lot a lot of
 
00:21:40.610 --> 00:21:40.620 align:start position:0%
different Revenue sources that they can
 
00:21:42.529 --> 00:21:42.539 align:start position:0%
pull from and send that money back to
 
00:21:45.409 --> 00:21:45.419 align:start position:0%
the communities for worthy programs
 
00:21:47.990 --> 00:21:48.000 align:start position:0%
so we believe that this is an important
 
00:21:49.730 --> 00:21:49.740 align:start position:0%
program it'll improve not only
 
00:21:51.649 --> 00:21:51.659 align:start position:0%
Wastewater systems but I agree I think
 
00:21:52.970 --> 00:21:52.980 align:start position:0%
it could help with the housing
 
00:21:54.890 --> 00:21:54.900 align:start position:0%
challenges that we face and general
 
00:21:56.990 --> 00:21:57.000 align:start position:0%
Economic Development
 
00:21:58.850 --> 00:21:58.860 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to representative McGuire
 
00:22:00.470 --> 00:22:00.480 align:start position:0%
you asked the question about would it be
 
00:22:03.289 --> 00:22:03.299 align:start position:0%
counted twice historically and I know Mr
 
00:22:05.090 --> 00:22:05.100 align:start position:0%
chairman you know this this these bills
 
00:22:07.490 --> 00:22:07.500 align:start position:0%
these Buko bucks bills if you will have
 
00:22:09.770 --> 00:22:09.780 align:start position:0%
been retained by this committee and then
 
00:22:13.190 --> 00:22:13.200 align:start position:0%
division one I believe is des uh you
 
00:22:15.470 --> 00:22:15.480 align:start position:0%
know they will decide if 15 million is
 
00:22:17.270 --> 00:22:17.280 align:start position:0%
the appropriate number or if it's some
 
00:22:19.669 --> 00:22:19.679 align:start position:0%
other number and I presume that that's
 
00:22:20.750 --> 00:22:20.760 align:start position:0%
what's going to happen with this bill
 
00:22:23.270 --> 00:22:23.280 align:start position:0%
but obviously that's up to you folks and
 
00:22:25.510 --> 00:22:25.520 align:start position:0%
in terms of pfas I'm not an engineer
 
00:22:28.490 --> 00:22:28.500 align:start position:0%
there are filtration systems there's
 
00:22:30.529 --> 00:22:30.539 align:start position:0%
charcoal systems there's remediation
 
00:22:33.130 --> 00:22:33.140 align:start position:0%
systems I can put you in touch with
 
00:22:35.870 --> 00:22:35.880 align:start position:0%
experts on this issue if you'd like Mr
 
00:22:39.350 --> 00:22:39.360 align:start position:0%
chairman there's also a pfas remediation
 
00:22:40.850 --> 00:22:40.860 align:start position:0%
fund that the legislature might remember
 
00:22:43.549 --> 00:22:43.559 align:start position:0%
there was a bill last year uh 25 million
 
00:22:46.250 --> 00:22:46.260 align:start position:0%
dollars to uh obviously the the
 
00:22:50.270 --> 00:22:50.280 align:start position:0%
legislature passed uh standards for pfas
 
00:22:53.930 --> 00:22:53.940 align:start position:0%
and um as part of that you appropriated
 
00:22:56.330 --> 00:22:56.340 align:start position:0%
funds to help the communities meet those
 
00:22:58.370 --> 00:22:58.380 align:start position:0%
standards so again I'm not an engineer
 
00:22:59.750 --> 00:22:59.760 align:start position:0%
but I can I can certainly put you in
 
00:23:02.029 --> 00:23:02.039 align:start position:0%
touch with experts on on pfas a lot of
 
00:23:04.430 --> 00:23:04.440 align:start position:0%
our members are working with communities
 
00:23:06.590 --> 00:23:06.600 align:start position:0%
like Litchfield and Merrimack who are on
 
00:23:08.570 --> 00:23:08.580 align:start position:0%
The Cutting Edge of this uh this
 
00:23:10.070 --> 00:23:10.080 align:start position:0%
important issue so thank you very much
 
00:23:12.289 --> 00:23:12.299 align:start position:0%
appreciate it
 
00:23:14.149 --> 00:23:14.159 align:start position:0%
thank you questions from committee
 
00:23:14.159 --> 00:23:17.630 align:start position:0%
thank you questions from committee
members

00:23:17.630 --> 00:23:17.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:20.210 --> 00:23:20.220 align:start position:0%
so I go back again
 
00:23:22.070 --> 00:23:22.080 align:start position:0%
in your in your experience even though
 
00:23:24.110 --> 00:23:24.120 align:start position:0%
you're not designing these plants how
 
00:23:26.210 --> 00:23:26.220 align:start position:0%
much more complexity is there as we've
 
00:23:29.510 --> 00:23:29.520 align:start position:0%
added these uh different rules for the
 
00:23:32.450 --> 00:23:32.460 align:start position:0%
for the amount of pfas and so on that
 
00:23:34.850 --> 00:23:34.860 align:start position:0%
can be in a system absolutely it's it's
 
00:23:37.070 --> 00:23:37.080 align:start position:0%
a it's a big concern and obviously many
 
00:23:40.090 --> 00:23:40.100 align:start position:0%
businesses were concerned about the cost
 
00:23:42.950 --> 00:23:42.960 align:start position:0%
it does seem am I I don't want to speak
 
00:23:44.750 --> 00:23:44.760 align:start position:0%
for Des but I do talk to them quite a
 
00:23:45.950 --> 00:23:45.960 align:start position:0%
bit it seems like most of the
 
00:23:48.169 --> 00:23:48.179 align:start position:0%
municipalities have been able to comply
 
00:23:50.210 --> 00:23:50.220 align:start position:0%
I think the pfas fund has been helpful
 
00:23:52.130 --> 00:23:52.140 align:start position:0%
so it doesn't seem like the standards
 
00:23:53.870 --> 00:23:53.880 align:start position:0%
are as onerous as some of the business
 
00:23:55.970 --> 00:23:55.980 align:start position:0%
groups uh had originally thought I
 
00:23:57.470 --> 00:23:57.480 align:start position:0%
haven't heard a lot of pushback about it
 
00:23:59.289 --> 00:23:59.299 align:start position:0%
the community seem to be in compliance
 
00:24:02.029 --> 00:24:02.039 align:start position:0%
that's the information that I have but
 
00:24:03.830 --> 00:24:03.840 align:start position:0%
certainly as the representative from the
 
00:24:05.750 --> 00:24:05.760 align:start position:0%
Water Works Association it is costly for
 
00:24:08.090 --> 00:24:08.100 align:start position:0%
these things and I believe that Senator
 
00:24:11.210 --> 00:24:11.220 align:start position:0%
rashardi uh has a bill in the Senate to
 
00:24:13.010 --> 00:24:13.020 align:start position:0%
I think it's what five million dollars
 
00:24:15.049 --> 00:24:15.059 align:start position:0%
in that pfas remediation fund so I don't
 
00:24:17.870 --> 00:24:17.880 align:start position:0%
know if that fund has been expended uh
 
00:24:19.789 --> 00:24:19.799 align:start position:0%
or not but there was 25 million put in
 
00:24:21.649 --> 00:24:21.659 align:start position:0%
last session and there's already a bill
 
00:24:23.270 --> 00:24:23.280 align:start position:0%
to you know replenish it with five
 
00:24:24.710 --> 00:24:24.720 align:start position:0%
million dollars I don't know what the
 
00:24:26.930 --> 00:24:26.940 align:start position:0%
Genesis of that is at this point I don't
 
00:24:29.210 --> 00:24:29.220 align:start position:0%
think it's on a public hearing yet but I
 
00:24:31.310 --> 00:24:31.320 align:start position:0%
I to your point I think it's expensive
 
00:24:33.890 --> 00:24:33.900 align:start position:0%
and it is complex and uh you know
 
00:24:35.630 --> 00:24:35.640 align:start position:0%
programs like this this is not really
 
00:24:37.970 --> 00:24:37.980 align:start position:0%
necessarily a pfas uh issue because this
 
00:24:40.190 --> 00:24:40.200 align:start position:0%
is more waste water but on the drinking
 
00:24:42.470 --> 00:24:42.480 align:start position:0%
water side certainly pfas is a very hot
 
00:24:44.570 --> 00:24:44.580 align:start position:0%
topic right now
 
00:24:46.490 --> 00:24:46.500 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Petrie for a
 
00:24:48.470 --> 00:24:48.480 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
00:24:51.890 --> 00:24:51.900 align:start position:0%
for taking my question uh other
 
00:24:54.350 --> 00:24:54.360 align:start position:0%
bad things in the water such as arsenic
 
00:24:56.149 --> 00:24:56.159 align:start position:0%
right on how much more does that add to
 
00:24:59.149 --> 00:24:59.159 align:start position:0%
the cost you think around the state I
 
00:25:00.890 --> 00:25:00.900 align:start position:0%
mean it's a great question I I can get
 
00:25:03.649 --> 00:25:03.659 align:start position:0%
you an answer to that uh I can talk to
 
00:25:05.930 --> 00:25:05.940 align:start position:0%
my Wastewater engineering or excuse me
 
00:25:07.669 --> 00:25:07.679 align:start position:0%
my drinking water engineering folks and
 
00:25:10.669 --> 00:25:10.679 align:start position:0%
I'm sure that there's tables and um you
 
00:25:11.990 --> 00:25:12.000 align:start position:0%
know in terms of how much the filtration
 
00:25:14.630 --> 00:25:14.640 align:start position:0%
is for these various carcinogens but I
 
00:25:16.130 --> 00:25:16.140 align:start position:0%
can't answer that at this point this
 
00:25:17.570 --> 00:25:17.580 align:start position:0%
morning but I will follow up with you
 
00:25:17.580 --> 00:25:20.330 align:start position:0%
morning but I will follow up with you
representative

00:25:20.330 --> 00:25:20.340 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:23.149 --> 00:25:23.159 align:start position:0%
thank you and uh representative erf has
 
00:25:24.710 --> 00:25:24.720 align:start position:0%
pointed out to me we're going to have a
 
00:25:26.450 --> 00:25:26.460 align:start position:0%
pre-fiscal meeting here at the end of
 
00:25:29.630 --> 00:25:29.640 align:start position:0%
all our hearings and uh
 
00:25:31.789 --> 00:25:31.799 align:start position:0%
we have an item that will be on the
 
00:25:33.890 --> 00:25:33.900 align:start position:0%
fiscal committee representative or if
 
00:25:41.750 --> 00:25:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:46.370 --> 00:25:46.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:49.850 --> 00:25:49.860 align:start position:0%
so we're going to I think accept a
 
00:25:52.370 --> 00:25:52.380 align:start position:0%
little over 1.3 million dollars
 
00:25:53.990 --> 00:25:54.000 align:start position:0%
for Wastewater infrastructure from
 
00:25:55.850 --> 00:25:55.860 align:start position:0%
federal government
 
00:26:00.169 --> 00:26:00.179 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:00.179 --> 00:26:02.470 align:start position:0%
 
representative

00:26:02.470 --> 00:26:02.480 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:26:05.390 --> 00:26:05.400 align:start position:0%
papavichi Mueller thank you Mr chairman
 
00:26:06.710 --> 00:26:06.720 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking the questions
 
00:26:10.789 --> 00:26:10.799 align:start position:0%
oh if you could I apologize now
 
00:26:12.830 --> 00:26:12.840 align:start position:0%
don't worry it's it's I'll try to answer
 
00:26:14.870 --> 00:26:14.880 align:start position:0%
two questions very short one of which
 
00:26:16.490 --> 00:26:16.500 align:start position:0%
I'm sure you can answer one of which I
 
00:26:18.649 --> 00:26:18.659 align:start position:0%
would appreciate feedback later on first
 
00:26:20.510 --> 00:26:20.520 align:start position:0%
question is what's the normal expected
 
00:26:22.370 --> 00:26:22.380 align:start position:0%
life of one of these projects obviously
 
00:26:24.590 --> 00:26:24.600 align:start position:0%
I expect that it's a long life asset but
 
00:26:27.169 --> 00:26:27.179 align:start position:0%
I'd like to know how much and two could
 
00:26:28.970 --> 00:26:28.980 align:start position:0%
you when you you know get back to your
 
00:26:31.310 --> 00:26:31.320 align:start position:0%
office maybe email the committee with
 
00:26:33.169 --> 00:26:33.179 align:start position:0%
some of the examples of medium-sized
 
00:26:35.690 --> 00:26:35.700 align:start position:0%
communities that couldn't afford to run
 
00:26:37.250 --> 00:26:37.260 align:start position:0%
the projects without a state
 
00:26:39.669 --> 00:26:39.679 align:start position:0%
contribution thank you absolutely I mean
 
00:26:41.810 --> 00:26:41.820 align:start position:0%
obviously it depends on the project but
 
00:26:43.909 --> 00:26:43.919 align:start position:0%
I mean typically these are decades-long
 
00:26:46.250 --> 00:26:46.260 align:start position:0%
systems you know uh
 
00:26:49.789 --> 00:26:49.799 align:start position:0%
30 years maybe longer obviously they
 
00:26:52.430 --> 00:26:52.440 align:start position:0%
need continuing maintenance but but I I
 
00:26:54.169 --> 00:26:54.179 align:start position:0%
can again I'll give you a better answer
 
00:26:56.029 --> 00:26:56.039 align:start position:0%
on both of those questions I will follow
 
00:26:57.890 --> 00:26:57.900 align:start position:0%
up on all of these issues
 
00:26:59.210 --> 00:26:59.220 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:27:02.210 --> 00:27:02.220 align:start position:0%
representative Mooney for a quick
 
00:27:04.010 --> 00:27:04.020 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and good morning
 
00:27:07.010 --> 00:27:07.020 align:start position:0%
as one that represents a community that
 
00:27:08.110 --> 00:27:08.120 align:start position:0%
has been
 
00:27:11.750 --> 00:27:11.760 align:start position:0%
extraordinarily affected by pfas would
 
00:27:13.909 --> 00:27:13.919 align:start position:0%
you agree that the reason why the cost
 
00:27:15.830 --> 00:27:15.840 align:start position:0%
is so high and all these numbers are so
 
00:27:17.930 --> 00:27:17.940 align:start position:0%
huge and these bills keep coming is
 
00:27:21.409 --> 00:27:21.419 align:start position:0%
because pfas can't be contained it's
 
00:27:23.870 --> 00:27:23.880 align:start position:0%
spreading to other communities other
 
00:27:26.210 --> 00:27:26.220 align:start position:0%
towns I think we're just scratching the
 
00:27:29.090 --> 00:27:29.100 align:start position:0%
surface in terms of the effects and the
 
00:27:32.690 --> 00:27:32.700 align:start position:0%
mileage this problem can extend out to
 
00:27:35.330 --> 00:27:35.340 align:start position:0%
do you agree I I do agree and I would I
 
00:27:37.909 --> 00:27:37.919 align:start position:0%
would say that uh you know ACS is a
 
00:27:39.950 --> 00:27:39.960 align:start position:0%
National Organization and New Hampshire
 
00:27:43.190 --> 00:27:43.200 align:start position:0%
is really uh a leader on that issue we
 
00:27:44.390 --> 00:27:44.400 align:start position:0%
were one of the first states to really
 
00:27:46.669 --> 00:27:46.679 align:start position:0%
take Vermont was maybe excuse me a
 
00:27:48.890 --> 00:27:48.900 align:start position:0%
little bit ahead but I think I think
 
00:27:50.510 --> 00:27:50.520 align:start position:0%
you've done A legislature has done
 
00:27:53.090 --> 00:27:53.100 align:start position:0%
really really great work on pfas
 
00:27:54.769 --> 00:27:54.779 align:start position:0%
and I know you've been a big part of
 
00:27:57.350 --> 00:27:57.360 align:start position:0%
that so I I def from the engineering
 
00:27:59.090 --> 00:27:59.100 align:start position:0%
community it's been science based which
 
00:28:01.490 --> 00:28:01.500 align:start position:0%
is important and we want to be partners
 
00:28:04.250 --> 00:28:04.260 align:start position:0%
with you to uh and the communities to
 
00:28:07.250 --> 00:28:07.260 align:start position:0%
get the uh the systems in in compliance
 
00:28:08.810 --> 00:28:08.820 align:start position:0%
with these standards that you're that
 
00:28:10.789 --> 00:28:10.799 align:start position:0%
you're setting with the Des and other
 
00:28:10.799 --> 00:28:16.070 align:start position:0%
you're setting with the Des and other
stakeholders

00:28:16.070 --> 00:28:16.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:17.870 --> 00:28:17.880 align:start position:0%
any further questions from committee
 
00:28:21.350 --> 00:28:21.360 align:start position:0%
members on House Bill 311 seeing none I
 
00:28:22.970 --> 00:28:22.980 align:start position:0%
will inform everyone that this will be
 
00:28:25.130 --> 00:28:25.140 align:start position:0%
going to division one they will be
 
00:28:27.409 --> 00:28:27.419 align:start position:0%
having further hearings on it and we'll
 
00:28:28.909 --> 00:28:28.919 align:start position:0%
look into it further and bring their
 
00:28:30.529 --> 00:28:30.539 align:start position:0%
recommendations back to the full
 
00:28:32.930 --> 00:28:32.940 align:start position:0%
committee for action
 
00:28:34.970 --> 00:28:34.980 align:start position:0%
I will now close the hearing on House
 
00:28:40.549 --> 00:28:40.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:43.610 --> 00:28:43.620 align:start position:0%
we have about a three minute break if
 
00:28:45.409 --> 00:28:45.419 align:start position:0%
anybody wants to just get up and stretch
 
00:28:49.250 --> 00:28:49.260 align:start position:0%
and then we'll start right at 10 30.
 
00:28:49.260 --> 00:28:50.930 align:start position:0%
and then we'll start right at 10 30.
and

00:28:50.930 --> 00:28:50.940 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:28:52.850 --> 00:28:52.860 align:start position:0%
I would like to
 
00:28:54.830 --> 00:28:54.840 align:start position:0%
oh that's the next
 
00:28:58.789 --> 00:28:58.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:01.549 --> 00:29:01.559 align:start position:0%
we had also the people that signed in
 
00:29:05.230 --> 00:29:05.240 align:start position:0%
were the same ones that testified
 
00:29:09.830 --> 00:29:09.840 align:start position:0%
Catherine heck and and I guess it's
 
00:29:13.510 --> 00:29:13.520 align:start position:0%
oh Senate Senator Denise ricciardi
 
00:29:16.610 --> 00:29:16.620 align:start position:0%
writes in in favor of it she signs the
 
00:29:18.649 --> 00:29:18.659 align:start position:0%
list for Pro
 
00:32:04.630 --> 00:32:04.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:07.430 --> 00:32:07.440 align:start position:0%
it being 10 30.
 
00:32:10.070 --> 00:32:10.080 align:start position:0%
I will open up a hearing on House Bill
 
00:32:13.310 --> 00:32:13.320 align:start position:0%
384 and call upon the prime sponsor
 
00:32:19.130 --> 00:32:19.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:21.350 --> 00:32:21.360 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair my name is Tracy
 
00:32:23.450 --> 00:32:23.460 align:start position:0%
Emrick I represent Hampton Rockingham
 
00:32:26.090 --> 00:32:26.100 align:start position:0%
District 29. I'm here this morning to
 
00:32:29.990 --> 00:32:30.000 align:start position:0%
introduce a bill for a new parking
 
00:32:32.149 --> 00:32:32.159 align:start position:0%
garage I think all of us have had the
 
00:32:33.769 --> 00:32:33.779 align:start position:0%
opportunity at some point in our career
 
00:32:36.409 --> 00:32:36.419 align:start position:0%
here to park at stores and there you'll
 
00:32:37.970 --> 00:32:37.980 align:start position:0%
probably hear testimony from people more
 
00:32:39.830 --> 00:32:39.840 align:start position:0%
knowledgeable about the condition of
 
00:32:42.590 --> 00:32:42.600 align:start position:0%
stores at this point this bill is for 25
 
00:32:45.710 --> 00:32:45.720 align:start position:0%
million dollars as a ceiling in order to
 
00:32:48.850 --> 00:32:48.860 align:start position:0%
build a parking garage between
 
00:32:53.029 --> 00:32:53.039 align:start position:0%
375 and 450 parking spaces the timeline
 
00:32:55.370 --> 00:32:55.380 align:start position:0%
for construction from the time the
 
00:32:58.610 --> 00:32:58.620 align:start position:0%
governor signs on signs off there's one
 
00:33:01.310 --> 00:33:01.320 align:start position:0%
year for permitting engineering and one
 
00:33:03.529 --> 00:33:03.539 align:start position:0%
year for construction so you've got two
 
00:33:06.529 --> 00:33:06.539 align:start position:0%
years after it's signed so we're looking
 
00:33:08.870 --> 00:33:08.880 align:start position:0%
at something in the future and that's
 
00:33:11.029 --> 00:33:11.039 align:start position:0%
the extent of my knowledge but you've
 
00:33:12.590 --> 00:33:12.600 align:start position:0%
got a lot of pink cards from people I
 
00:33:13.789 --> 00:33:13.799 align:start position:0%
think that are much more knowledgeable
 
00:33:15.950 --> 00:33:15.960 align:start position:0%
than I but I'll answer questions on my
 
00:33:18.289 --> 00:33:18.299 align:start position:0%
limited knowledge
 
00:33:19.610 --> 00:33:19.620 align:start position:0%
are there any questions for
 
00:33:21.649 --> 00:33:21.659 align:start position:0%
representative Emrick
 
00:33:28.190 --> 00:33:28.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:30.590 --> 00:33:30.600 align:start position:0%
we next have a card from the speaker at
 
00:33:32.810 --> 00:33:32.820 align:start position:0%
areas represented speaker Sherman
 
00:33:48.850 --> 00:33:48.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:51.350 --> 00:33:51.360 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr chairman members of the
 
00:33:51.360 --> 00:33:53.389 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr chairman members of the
committee

00:33:53.389 --> 00:33:53.399 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:33:56.029 --> 00:33:56.039 align:start position:0%
two years ago when I was elected into
 
00:33:57.409 --> 00:33:57.419 align:start position:0%
the position
 
00:33:59.210 --> 00:33:59.220 align:start position:0%
I thought I had a lot of things on my
 
00:34:01.909 --> 00:34:01.919 align:start position:0%
plate this was not one of them
 
00:34:05.090 --> 00:34:05.100 align:start position:0%
but the fact of the matter is it became
 
00:34:10.010 --> 00:34:10.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:12.950 --> 00:34:12.960 align:start position:0%
I want to just go over a little bit of
 
00:34:14.450 --> 00:34:14.460 align:start position:0%
the history
 
00:34:14.460 --> 00:34:16.430 align:start position:0%
the history
of this

00:34:16.430 --> 00:34:16.440 align:start position:0%
of this
 
00:34:19.490 --> 00:34:19.500 align:start position:0%
current garage over in store Street
 
00:34:22.190 --> 00:34:22.200 align:start position:0%
the initial cost was seven million
 
00:34:22.200 --> 00:34:24.349 align:start position:0%
the initial cost was seven million
dollars

00:34:24.349 --> 00:34:24.359 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:34:26.629 --> 00:34:26.639 align:start position:0%
maintenance stabilization sends
 
00:34:30.050 --> 00:34:30.060 align:start position:0%
construction starting in 1983
 
00:34:35.389 --> 00:34:35.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:39.889 --> 00:34:39.899 align:start position:0%
just recently in 19
 
00:34:43.970 --> 00:34:43.980 align:start position:0%
we appropriated 2 million 563 thousand
 
00:34:47.030 --> 00:34:47.040 align:start position:0%
dollars and that was construction and
 
00:34:52.730 --> 00:34:52.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:54.889 --> 00:34:54.899 align:start position:0%
the garage was built with a lifespan of
 
00:34:57.290 --> 00:34:57.300 align:start position:0%
approximately 25 to 30 years
 
00:35:01.250 --> 00:35:01.260 align:start position:0%
went out two years shy of 50 years
 
00:35:03.710 --> 00:35:03.720 align:start position:0%
anybody that is parked over there has
 
00:35:06.310 --> 00:35:06.320 align:start position:0%
noticed there's a double layer of
 
00:35:09.770 --> 00:35:09.780 align:start position:0%
netting underneath the Upper Floor to
 
00:35:11.510 --> 00:35:11.520 align:start position:0%
catch the concrete so it doesn't fall on
 
00:35:13.490 --> 00:35:13.500 align:start position:0%
somebody or fall in the cars which has
 
00:35:13.500 --> 00:35:15.530 align:start position:0%
somebody or fall in the cars which has
happened

00:35:15.530 --> 00:35:15.540 align:start position:0%
happened
 
00:35:17.810 --> 00:35:17.820 align:start position:0%
the bottom line is ladies and gentlemen
 
00:35:20.150 --> 00:35:20.160 align:start position:0%
the garage at store street is falling
 
00:35:20.160 --> 00:35:22.010 align:start position:0%
the garage at store street is falling
apart

00:35:22.010 --> 00:35:22.020 align:start position:0%
apart
 
00:35:24.770 --> 00:35:24.780 align:start position:0%
we predict maybe a couple three years or
 
00:35:26.150 --> 00:35:26.160 align:start position:0%
something and it would probably won't be
 
00:35:27.650 --> 00:35:27.660 align:start position:0%
able to use it anymore
 
00:35:29.810 --> 00:35:29.820 align:start position:0%
this is just reality
 
00:35:33.050 --> 00:35:33.060 align:start position:0%
I did not want to spend 25 the 35
 
00:35:34.910 --> 00:35:34.920 align:start position:0%
million dollars building a new parking
 
00:35:36.349 --> 00:35:36.359 align:start position:0%
garage that money could have been spent
 
00:35:39.230 --> 00:35:39.240 align:start position:0%
elsewhere but the fact of the matter is
 
00:35:42.530 --> 00:35:42.540 align:start position:0%
if we don't build a new garage
 
00:35:44.030 --> 00:35:44.040 align:start position:0%
many of you aren't going to have a place
 
00:35:46.550 --> 00:35:46.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:49.670 --> 00:35:49.680 align:start position:0%
that that's just the bottom line uh
 
00:35:54.109 --> 00:35:54.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:56.329 --> 00:35:56.339 align:start position:0%
somebody break down
 
00:35:59.390 --> 00:35:59.400 align:start position:0%
what we have right now
 
00:36:02.030 --> 00:36:02.040 align:start position:0%
um we have 400 house members
 
00:36:04.390 --> 00:36:04.400 align:start position:0%
24 senate members
 
00:36:07.790 --> 00:36:07.800 align:start position:0%
126 full-time employees and 44 part-time
 
00:36:07.800 --> 00:36:09.349 align:start position:0%
126 full-time employees and 44 part-time
employees

00:36:09.349 --> 00:36:09.359 align:start position:0%
employees
 
00:36:11.990 --> 00:36:12.000 align:start position:0%
spaces we have right now are 209 and
 
00:36:13.250 --> 00:36:13.260 align:start position:0%
store Street
 
00:36:18.790 --> 00:36:18.800 align:start position:0%
50 Street spaces uh 24th at Green Street
 
00:36:23.870 --> 00:36:23.880 align:start position:0%
17 doj which will be gone uh 61 upper
 
00:36:27.710 --> 00:36:27.720 align:start position:0%
level lob and 57 LOB
 
00:36:30.230 --> 00:36:30.240 align:start position:0%
if we have a full session and every
 
00:36:32.630 --> 00:36:32.640 align:start position:0%
member shows up for session we're about
 
00:36:35.210 --> 00:36:35.220 align:start position:0%
40 to 50 spaces shy of even having a
 
00:36:38.450 --> 00:36:38.460 align:start position:0%
place for them to park right now
 
00:36:42.050 --> 00:36:42.060 align:start position:0%
so we're looking at a garage that will
 
00:36:42.060 --> 00:36:43.190 align:start position:0%
so we're looking at a garage that will
accommodate

00:36:43.190 --> 00:36:43.200 align:start position:0%
accommodate
 
00:36:45.710 --> 00:36:45.720 align:start position:0%
400 people this will put everybody
 
00:36:49.370 --> 00:36:49.380 align:start position:0%
underneath the same roof it will uh
 
00:36:52.670 --> 00:36:52.680 align:start position:0%
obviously we I I'm not a architect but I
 
00:36:53.990 --> 00:36:54.000 align:start position:0%
would assume that you know we'll have
 
00:36:56.569 --> 00:36:56.579 align:start position:0%
handicap spaces on the first floor we'll
 
00:36:58.670 --> 00:36:58.680 align:start position:0%
have some charging stations probably on
 
00:37:00.890 --> 00:37:00.900 align:start position:0%
the first floor all that has to be
 
00:37:02.630 --> 00:37:02.640 align:start position:0%
worked out
 
00:37:04.550 --> 00:37:04.560 align:start position:0%
that's just the Baseline of where we're
 
00:37:04.560 --> 00:37:05.750 align:start position:0%
that's just the Baseline of where we're
at

00:37:05.750 --> 00:37:05.760 align:start position:0%
at
 
00:37:05.760 --> 00:37:07.370 align:start position:0%
at
um

00:37:07.370 --> 00:37:07.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:09.589 --> 00:37:09.599 align:start position:0%
as representative Emrick said it's
 
00:37:11.150 --> 00:37:11.160 align:start position:0%
probably going to take two two and a
 
00:37:17.329 --> 00:37:17.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:20.589 --> 00:37:20.599 align:start position:0%
unless somebody has an alternative
 
00:37:23.390 --> 00:37:23.400 align:start position:0%
where we can park people when store
 
00:37:25.790 --> 00:37:25.800 align:start position:0%
street is not usable anymore
 
00:37:29.030 --> 00:37:29.040 align:start position:0%
let me know but as to right now nobody's
 
00:37:30.950 --> 00:37:30.960 align:start position:0%
been able to come up with a
 
00:37:33.530 --> 00:37:33.540 align:start position:0%
alternative plan
 
00:37:33.540 --> 00:37:35.990 align:start position:0%
alternative plan
um

00:37:35.990 --> 00:37:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:37.790 --> 00:37:37.800 align:start position:0%
as if anything
 
00:37:39.770 --> 00:37:39.780 align:start position:0%
as the money we have to put into this
 
00:37:42.170 --> 00:37:42.180 align:start position:0%
building every year this is what 200 and
 
00:37:45.050 --> 00:37:45.060 align:start position:0%
someone years old it needs work that
 
00:37:48.410 --> 00:37:48.420 align:start position:0%
garage is literally falling apart
 
00:37:51.770 --> 00:37:51.780 align:start position:0%
and it needs to be replaced now's the
 
00:37:53.870 --> 00:37:53.880 align:start position:0%
time to do it it's not going to get any
 
00:37:55.730 --> 00:37:55.740 align:start position:0%
cheaper down the road
 
00:37:55.740 --> 00:37:57.109 align:start position:0%
cheaper down the road
uh

00:37:57.109 --> 00:37:57.119 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:37:59.270 --> 00:37:59.280 align:start position:0%
I'll try and answer any questions that
 
00:38:01.010 --> 00:38:01.020 align:start position:0%
don't have to go too deep into the
 
00:38:02.569 --> 00:38:02.579 align:start position:0%
construction part of it we have plenty
 
00:38:05.510 --> 00:38:05.520 align:start position:0%
of people here that can do that
 
00:38:07.430 --> 00:38:07.440 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker any questions from
 
00:38:08.930 --> 00:38:08.940 align:start position:0%
the committee members
 
00:38:11.270 --> 00:38:11.280 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire
 
00:38:12.829 --> 00:38:12.839 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you Mr
 
00:38:17.210 --> 00:38:17.220 align:start position:0%
Speaker it wasn't this bill or a similar
 
00:38:19.130 --> 00:38:19.140 align:start position:0%
one passed last year or some money
 
00:38:20.870 --> 00:38:20.880 align:start position:0%
already allocated to this so money was
 
00:38:24.109 --> 00:38:24.119 align:start position:0%
allocate yeah yes last year we passed
 
00:38:26.270 --> 00:38:26.280 align:start position:0%
the bill I think it was nine and a half
 
00:38:28.490 --> 00:38:28.500 align:start position:0%
million dollars that was the move the
 
00:38:31.130 --> 00:38:31.140 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office and refit the
 
00:38:33.530 --> 00:38:33.540 align:start position:0%
building that we're moving them into and
 
00:38:36.710 --> 00:38:36.720 align:start position:0%
that was also for the um you know the
 
00:38:40.250 --> 00:38:40.260 align:start position:0%
preliminary destruction of the jail the
 
00:38:42.050 --> 00:38:42.060 align:start position:0%
building over there
 
00:38:44.270 --> 00:38:44.280 align:start position:0%
we didn't we didn't actually put money
 
00:38:46.730 --> 00:38:46.740 align:start position:0%
into the budget last year last session
 
00:38:48.589 --> 00:38:48.599 align:start position:0%
that had to do with the actual
 
00:38:51.490 --> 00:38:51.500 align:start position:0%
construction of the building
 
00:38:54.589 --> 00:38:54.599 align:start position:0%
so the previous parking garage we now
 
00:38:56.990 --> 00:38:57.000 align:start position:0%
know is a design that lasted for 50
 
00:39:00.530 --> 00:39:00.540 align:start position:0%
years couldn't it be torn down and
 
00:39:02.990 --> 00:39:03.000 align:start position:0%
rebuilt with the same same plans and for
 
00:39:05.089 --> 00:39:05.099 align:start position:0%
another 50 years
 
00:39:07.250 --> 00:39:07.260 align:start position:0%
right now the city of Concord wants its
 
00:39:10.550 --> 00:39:10.560 align:start position:0%
wants its space back
 
00:39:12.770 --> 00:39:12.780 align:start position:0%
and if we tear down the parking garage
 
00:39:14.930 --> 00:39:14.940 align:start position:0%
over there and we rebuild it over there
 
00:39:17.089 --> 00:39:17.099 align:start position:0%
it's probably going to take the same
 
00:39:18.890 --> 00:39:18.900 align:start position:0%
amount of time to two and a half three
 
00:39:18.900 --> 00:39:19.910 align:start position:0%
amount of time to two and a half three
years

00:39:19.910 --> 00:39:19.920 align:start position:0%
years
 
00:39:21.290 --> 00:39:21.300 align:start position:0%
where the hell you're going to park
 
00:39:23.870 --> 00:39:23.880 align:start position:0%
everybody for three years
 
00:39:26.210 --> 00:39:26.220 align:start position:0%
this solves the problem the AGS moving
 
00:39:28.250 --> 00:39:28.260 align:start position:0%
down to uh you know the Financial
 
00:39:30.290 --> 00:39:30.300 align:start position:0%
finance what is it Financial building
 
00:39:32.750 --> 00:39:32.760 align:start position:0%
down the street about a mile down the
 
00:39:35.210 --> 00:39:35.220 align:start position:0%
street they've already got uh working on
 
00:39:37.790 --> 00:39:37.800 align:start position:0%
the uh all the inside construction that
 
00:39:40.030 --> 00:39:40.040 align:start position:0%
they needed to do setting up the offices
 
00:39:43.069 --> 00:39:43.079 align:start position:0%
uh and um you know they've already got
 
00:39:45.050 --> 00:39:45.060 align:start position:0%
the lease signed for that building
 
00:39:48.530 --> 00:39:48.540 align:start position:0%
so they're going to move in there right
 
00:39:50.150 --> 00:39:50.160 align:start position:0%
I don't know probably within the next
 
00:39:53.710 --> 00:39:53.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:57.230 --> 00:39:57.240 align:start position:0%
any representative Murray thank you Mr
 
00:39:59.630 --> 00:39:59.640 align:start position:0%
Speaker Mr chairman and welcome Mr
 
00:39:59.640 --> 00:40:00.650 align:start position:0%
Speaker Mr chairman and welcome Mr
Speaker

00:40:00.650 --> 00:40:00.660 align:start position:0%
Speaker
 
00:40:02.510 --> 00:40:02.520 align:start position:0%
um I remember speaking on this last year
 
00:40:04.069 --> 00:40:04.079 align:start position:0%
the year before on the floor of the
 
00:40:06.050 --> 00:40:06.060 align:start position:0%
house when we first started you know
 
00:40:08.450 --> 00:40:08.460 align:start position:0%
this discussions were coming up it seems
 
00:40:09.770 --> 00:40:09.780 align:start position:0%
to me I recall that the original
 
00:40:12.170 --> 00:40:12.180 align:start position:0%
estimate was around 48 million in order
 
00:40:14.510 --> 00:40:14.520 align:start position:0%
to do the entire project do you have any
 
00:40:16.270 --> 00:40:16.280 align:start position:0%
sense or maybe someone here will know
 
00:40:18.770 --> 00:40:18.780 align:start position:0%
where did we come up with the 25 million
 
00:40:20.569 --> 00:40:20.579 align:start position:0%
because I do recall that it was quite a
 
00:40:22.609 --> 00:40:22.619 align:start position:0%
bit more than that when we first or were
 
00:40:24.650 --> 00:40:24.660 align:start position:0%
speaking well last last year
 
00:40:26.569 --> 00:40:26.579 align:start position:0%
representative uh we were talking about
 
00:40:28.970 --> 00:40:28.980 align:start position:0%
35 million dollars total
 
00:40:31.970 --> 00:40:31.980 align:start position:0%
and that you know we we appropriated I
 
00:40:34.250 --> 00:40:34.260 align:start position:0%
think it was 9.5 last year
 
00:40:37.250 --> 00:40:37.260 align:start position:0%
last session and this is the 25 to
 
00:40:44.329 --> 00:40:44.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:46.550 --> 00:40:46.560 align:start position:0%
see no further questions thank you Mr
 
00:40:46.560 --> 00:40:51.829 align:start position:0%
see no further questions thank you Mr
Speaker

00:40:51.829 --> 00:40:51.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:53.690 --> 00:40:53.700 align:start position:0%
we'll next call on commissioner Charlie
 
00:41:01.010 --> 00:41:01.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:03.290 --> 00:41:03.300 align:start position:0%
good morning uh I'm Charlie arlinghaus
 
00:41:04.490 --> 00:41:04.500 align:start position:0%
I'm the commissioner of administrative
 
00:41:07.370 --> 00:41:07.380 align:start position:0%
services and uh joining me is um Ted
 
00:41:08.690 --> 00:41:08.700 align:start position:0%
kupper who is our director of Public
 
00:41:11.750 --> 00:41:11.760 align:start position:0%
Works and I will note that Ted is an
 
00:41:11.760 --> 00:41:12.650 align:start position:0%
Works and I will note that Ted is an
engineer

00:41:12.650 --> 00:41:12.660 align:start position:0%
engineer
 
00:41:15.650 --> 00:41:15.660 align:start position:0%
whereas I have no discernible Talent
 
00:41:15.660 --> 00:41:16.550 align:start position:0%
whereas I have no discernible Talent
um

00:41:16.550 --> 00:41:16.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:41:16.560 --> 00:41:18.470 align:start position:0%
um
but

00:41:18.470 --> 00:41:18.480 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:41:22.130 --> 00:41:22.140 align:start position:0%
um I uh so we were approached last year
 
00:41:23.990 --> 00:41:24.000 align:start position:0%
the legislature wants to build a parking
 
00:41:25.310 --> 00:41:25.320 align:start position:0%
garage on the site that currently
 
00:41:28.250 --> 00:41:28.260 align:start position:0%
contains the Department of Justice
 
00:41:31.849 --> 00:41:31.859 align:start position:0%
um and uh we've been working on that
 
00:41:34.069 --> 00:41:34.079 align:start position:0%
process there was 9.35 Million
 
00:41:37.069 --> 00:41:37.079 align:start position:0%
appropriated last year it includes money
 
00:41:38.569 --> 00:41:38.579 align:start position:0%
for tearing down the Department of
 
00:41:41.510 --> 00:41:41.520 align:start position:0%
Justice and the design and Engineering
 
00:41:43.310 --> 00:41:43.320 align:start position:0%
work on the both the tear down of that
 
00:41:45.589 --> 00:41:45.599 align:start position:0%
the teardown of storage Street and the
 
00:41:47.349 --> 00:41:47.359 align:start position:0%
preliminary design and Engineering work
 
00:41:51.530 --> 00:41:51.540 align:start position:0%
on planning for a garage I believe at
 
00:41:52.970 --> 00:41:52.980 align:start position:0%
that time there were there was
 
00:41:57.530 --> 00:41:57.540 align:start position:0%
discussion of 600 spaces 450 spaces 350
 
00:42:00.170 --> 00:42:00.180 align:start position:0%
spaces and um
 
00:42:01.970 --> 00:42:01.980 align:start position:0%
unfortunately our garage is the kind of
 
00:42:03.290 --> 00:42:03.300 align:start position:0%
thing where where there's a little bit
 
00:42:05.990 --> 00:42:06.000 align:start position:0%
of a plug-and-play aspect to it it's not
 
00:42:08.450 --> 00:42:08.460 align:start position:0%
exactly fifty thousand dollars a space
 
00:42:10.130 --> 00:42:10.140 align:start position:0%
but it's something like that and you can
 
00:42:11.930 --> 00:42:11.940 align:start position:0%
figure that out
 
00:42:14.690 --> 00:42:14.700 align:start position:0%
um we have uh gone back to the house and
 
00:42:15.950 --> 00:42:15.960 align:start position:0%
and also some of that money is for
 
00:42:18.470 --> 00:42:18.480 align:start position:0%
moving doj and retrofitting a building
 
00:42:20.390 --> 00:42:20.400 align:start position:0%
which we now have a lease on
 
00:42:22.130 --> 00:42:22.140 align:start position:0%
uh which is called Granite place and
 
00:42:24.589 --> 00:42:24.599 align:start position:0%
used to House Lincoln Financial so
 
00:42:27.670 --> 00:42:27.680 align:start position:0%
people describe it in 18 different ways
 
00:42:29.630 --> 00:42:29.640 align:start position:0%
generally including either the word
 
00:42:33.109 --> 00:42:33.119 align:start position:0%
Granite Financial or Lincoln but it's
 
00:42:35.150 --> 00:42:35.160 align:start position:0%
that building that was once chub was
 
00:42:37.849 --> 00:42:37.859 align:start position:0%
once Lincoln Financial so
 
00:42:39.170 --> 00:42:39.180 align:start position:0%
um that's about a hundred thousand
 
00:42:42.050 --> 00:42:42.060 align:start position:0%
square feet and the doj will occupy
 
00:42:44.210 --> 00:42:44.220 align:start position:0%
about two-thirds of it
 
00:42:47.930 --> 00:42:47.940 align:start position:0%
um so the cost of a cost of a garage is
 
00:42:50.690 --> 00:42:50.700 align:start position:0%
um is probably as I say about
 
00:42:52.790 --> 00:42:52.800 align:start position:0%
um about fifty thousand dollars of space
 
00:42:56.210 --> 00:42:56.220 align:start position:0%
in theory a forty thousand a 450 space
 
00:42:59.450 --> 00:42:59.460 align:start position:0%
garage would cost something like 22.5
 
00:43:02.510 --> 00:43:02.520 align:start position:0%
million fewer spaces less than that the
 
00:43:04.010 --> 00:43:04.020 align:start position:0%
exact price depends a lot on Market
 
00:43:04.020 --> 00:43:05.690 align:start position:0%
exact price depends a lot on Market
design

00:43:05.690 --> 00:43:05.700 align:start position:0%
design
 
00:43:09.050 --> 00:43:09.060 align:start position:0%
Etc we have a uh we have a contract that
 
00:43:11.690 --> 00:43:11.700 align:start position:0%
we're about to execute with um a company
 
00:43:14.150 --> 00:43:14.160 align:start position:0%
called Scott and partners who's most
 
00:43:15.530 --> 00:43:15.540 align:start position:0%
notable and they've done a lot of State
 
00:43:18.290 --> 00:43:18.300 align:start position:0%
work but most notably for you that you
 
00:43:20.690 --> 00:43:20.700 align:start position:0%
can see from here is they designed from
 
00:43:24.109 --> 00:43:24.119 align:start position:0%
The Boiler House at the corner of green
 
00:43:27.250 --> 00:43:27.260 align:start position:0%
and school I think is where that is
 
00:43:29.870 --> 00:43:29.880 align:start position:0%
which people tend to appreciate because
 
00:43:31.490 --> 00:43:31.500 align:start position:0%
it fits into the
 
00:43:33.710 --> 00:43:33.720 align:start position:0%
historic district which is something
 
00:43:35.510 --> 00:43:35.520 align:start position:0%
this garage would have to do wouldn't
 
00:43:37.910 --> 00:43:37.920 align:start position:0%
just be a giant concrete structure but
 
00:43:39.589 --> 00:43:39.599 align:start position:0%
would have to fit into the historic
 
00:43:42.770 --> 00:43:42.780 align:start position:0%
district so you can build an attractive
 
00:43:45.010 --> 00:43:45.020 align:start position:0%
parking garage
 
00:43:47.329 --> 00:43:47.339 align:start position:0%
there is some evidence of that I've seen
 
00:43:50.630 --> 00:43:50.640 align:start position:0%
pictures so we can do that we're here to
 
00:43:51.950 --> 00:43:51.960 align:start position:0%
answer any questions you have about the
 
00:43:53.510 --> 00:43:53.520 align:start position:0%
cost or about store Street or about the
 
00:43:55.370 --> 00:43:55.380 align:start position:0%
garage itself or anything else related
 
00:43:56.890 --> 00:43:56.900 align:start position:0%
to the project
 
00:43:59.150 --> 00:43:59.160 align:start position:0%
and I can tell you what we've been doing
 
00:44:01.430 --> 00:44:01.440 align:start position:0%
and Ted will be happy to answer
 
00:44:04.370 --> 00:44:04.380 align:start position:0%
everything that's more technical
 
00:44:07.670 --> 00:44:07.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:09.349 --> 00:44:09.359 align:start position:0%
Public Works director would you spell
 
00:44:12.170 --> 00:44:12.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:14.450 --> 00:44:14.460 align:start position:0%
uh it's Theodore and last name
 
00:44:14.460 --> 00:44:22.910 align:start position:0%
uh it's Theodore and last name
k-u-p-p-e-r

00:44:22.910 --> 00:44:22.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:24.890 --> 00:44:24.900 align:start position:0%
thank you questions from the committee
 
00:44:27.230 --> 00:44:27.240 align:start position:0%
representative hole
 
00:44:28.990 --> 00:44:29.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
00:44:31.190 --> 00:44:31.200 align:start position:0%
I know we've considered the Department
 
00:44:33.829 --> 00:44:33.839 align:start position:0%
of Justice property the building is
 
00:44:36.290 --> 00:44:36.300 align:start position:0%
worth approximately
 
00:44:38.690 --> 00:44:38.700 align:start position:0%
um five million dollars or thereabouts
 
00:44:41.089 --> 00:44:41.099 align:start position:0%
based on the assessed value that's on
 
00:44:42.170 --> 00:44:42.180 align:start position:0%
the sheet although it is a
 
00:44:43.190 --> 00:44:43.200 align:start position:0%
government-owned building and we don't
 
00:44:46.370 --> 00:44:46.380 align:start position:0%
collect taxes what other
 
00:44:49.550 --> 00:44:49.560 align:start position:0%
pieces of land within a reasonable
 
00:44:52.130 --> 00:44:52.140 align:start position:0%
walking distance of of the State House
 
00:44:55.069 --> 00:44:55.079 align:start position:0%
have been considered
 
00:44:57.290 --> 00:44:57.300 align:start position:0%
I I don't know
 
00:44:58.849 --> 00:44:58.859 align:start position:0%
um I know that over the years there's
 
00:45:00.290 --> 00:45:00.300 align:start position:0%
been a lot of discussion about a lot of
 
00:45:02.750 --> 00:45:02.760 align:start position:0%
pieces of property and
 
00:45:04.069 --> 00:45:04.079 align:start position:0%
um none of which are owned by the state
 
00:45:07.970 --> 00:45:07.980 align:start position:0%
currently and so I I know people looked
 
00:45:10.010 --> 00:45:10.020 align:start position:0%
down State Street a bit and apparently
 
00:45:11.990 --> 00:45:12.000 align:start position:0%
there's some some space behind some
 
00:45:13.730 --> 00:45:13.740 align:start position:0%
buildings there all of those would have
 
00:45:15.950 --> 00:45:15.960 align:start position:0%
acquisition costs
 
00:45:18.050 --> 00:45:18.060 align:start position:0%
um I don't realistically know what else
 
00:45:20.329 --> 00:45:20.339 align:start position:0%
is possible in in the sense of of State
 
00:45:22.490 --> 00:45:22.500 align:start position:0%
ownership I mean could you theoretically
 
00:45:25.130 --> 00:45:25.140 align:start position:0%
buy some you know building on Main
 
00:45:26.510 --> 00:45:26.520 align:start position:0%
Street and tear down and do something
 
00:45:29.089 --> 00:45:29.099 align:start position:0%
differently yes but I I don't know that
 
00:45:30.950 --> 00:45:30.960 align:start position:0%
we've done any serious consideration of
 
00:45:32.450 --> 00:45:32.460 align:start position:0%
any other site
 
00:45:35.270 --> 00:45:35.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:35.280 --> 00:45:37.309 align:start position:0%
 
representative

00:45:37.309 --> 00:45:37.319 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:45:38.809 --> 00:45:38.819 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
00:45:40.069 --> 00:45:40.079 align:start position:0%
my question
 
00:45:42.170 --> 00:45:42.180 align:start position:0%
um right now the state of Storrs Street
 
00:45:45.170 --> 00:45:45.180 align:start position:0%
makes it absolutely inaccessible to
 
00:45:46.849 --> 00:45:46.859 align:start position:0%
those members who have Mobility
 
00:45:50.750 --> 00:45:50.760 align:start position:0%
challenges and the majority of them are
 
00:45:53.150 --> 00:45:53.160 align:start position:0%
parked in the street which this time of
 
00:45:55.550 --> 00:45:55.560 align:start position:0%
year with the condition of the sidewalks
 
00:45:56.990 --> 00:45:57.000 align:start position:0%
and the streets are I think are almost
 
00:45:59.450 --> 00:45:59.460 align:start position:0%
even could be potentially worse
 
00:45:59.460 --> 00:46:00.290 align:start position:0%
even could be potentially worse
um

00:46:00.290 --> 00:46:00.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:04.210 --> 00:46:04.220 align:start position:0%
is the plan to have all of the
 
00:46:06.890 --> 00:46:06.900 align:start position:0%
representatives who have disabilities
 
00:46:10.010 --> 00:46:10.020 align:start position:0%
and Mobility challenges safely parked in
 
00:46:11.510 --> 00:46:11.520 align:start position:0%
the new spot and will you be able to
 
00:46:14.329 --> 00:46:14.339 align:start position:0%
accommodate everyone in there
 
00:46:17.089 --> 00:46:17.099 align:start position:0%
I I think that exactly where where every
 
00:46:19.130 --> 00:46:19.140 align:start position:0%
member is assigned would be would be a
 
00:46:20.930 --> 00:46:20.940 align:start position:0%
decision for for legislative leadership
 
00:46:23.150 --> 00:46:23.160 align:start position:0%
at that time I know that in designing
 
00:46:25.190 --> 00:46:25.200 align:start position:0%
our garage we would build a garage that
 
00:46:27.589 --> 00:46:27.599 align:start position:0%
had significant space for
 
00:46:29.870 --> 00:46:29.880 align:start position:0%
um for people with disabilities
 
00:46:29.880 --> 00:46:30.470 align:start position:0%
um for people with disabilities
um

00:46:30.470 --> 00:46:30.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:33.109 --> 00:46:33.119 align:start position:0%
um both both handicap spaces and then a
 
00:46:35.270 --> 00:46:35.280 align:start position:0%
number of spaces that are that
 
00:46:36.890 --> 00:46:36.900 align:start position:0%
um even if you don't need a handicap
 
00:46:38.809 --> 00:46:38.819 align:start position:0%
space that are more accessible just
 
00:46:40.849 --> 00:46:40.859 align:start position:0%
because they're closer and the garage is
 
00:46:43.490 --> 00:46:43.500 align:start position:0%
undercover Etc so the the mobility
 
00:46:46.309 --> 00:46:46.319 align:start position:0%
issues is a significant aspect of the
 
00:46:48.710 --> 00:46:48.720 align:start position:0%
design and I I would anticipate anyway
 
00:46:51.349 --> 00:46:51.359 align:start position:0%
that everybody with a mobility issue I
 
00:46:52.609 --> 00:46:52.619 align:start position:0%
don't know how many people that is today
 
00:46:54.890 --> 00:46:54.900 align:start position:0%
it's not something we track although I'm
 
00:46:56.870 --> 00:46:56.880 align:start position:0%
sure that other people do but I'm sure
 
00:46:59.990 --> 00:47:00.000 align:start position:0%
they would be accommodated follow-up
 
00:47:01.550 --> 00:47:01.560 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
00:47:03.050 --> 00:47:03.060 align:start position:0%
um just sort of connected to that is
 
00:47:05.450 --> 00:47:05.460 align:start position:0%
there a plan or an idea in place for the
 
00:47:05.460 --> 00:47:06.349 align:start position:0%
there a plan or an idea in place for the
safe

00:47:06.349 --> 00:47:06.359 align:start position:0%
safe
 
00:47:08.089 --> 00:47:08.099 align:start position:0%
um movement of Parkers from the garage
 
00:47:09.890 --> 00:47:09.900 align:start position:0%
to the yellow bee or to the state house
 
00:47:11.870 --> 00:47:11.880 align:start position:0%
in terms of
 
00:47:14.210 --> 00:47:14.220 align:start position:0%
um a tunnel crosswalks pedestrian
 
00:47:16.730 --> 00:47:16.740 align:start position:0%
anything I think it's something that has
 
00:47:19.430 --> 00:47:19.440 align:start position:0%
to be considered as part of a design I
 
00:47:21.470 --> 00:47:21.480 align:start position:0%
mean my my sense is from preliminary
 
00:47:23.210 --> 00:47:23.220 align:start position:0%
discussions with leadership that a
 
00:47:25.490 --> 00:47:25.500 align:start position:0%
tunnel is probably out in large part
 
00:47:27.470 --> 00:47:27.480 align:start position:0%
because of the water table and and if
 
00:47:28.730 --> 00:47:28.740 align:start position:0%
you know much about the you know their
 
00:47:30.589 --> 00:47:30.599 align:start position:0%
two tunnels now right the one of the
 
00:47:32.569 --> 00:47:32.579 align:start position:0%
annex and the one of the lob and they're
 
00:47:34.309 --> 00:47:34.319 align:start position:0%
often wetness issues there I think
 
00:47:36.530 --> 00:47:36.540 align:start position:0%
people uh there's been an expression
 
00:47:39.370 --> 00:47:39.380 align:start position:0%
that a tunnel is probably not ideal
 
00:47:42.349 --> 00:47:42.359 align:start position:0%
but there have been various discussions
 
00:47:44.270 --> 00:47:44.280 align:start position:0%
with the city about the state of Capitol
 
00:47:46.670 --> 00:47:46.680 align:start position:0%
Street and what that would be and so
 
00:47:49.609 --> 00:47:49.619 align:start position:0%
initially relatively easy access to the
 
00:47:52.809 --> 00:47:52.819 align:start position:0%
lob itself but as part of any design
 
00:47:56.270 --> 00:47:56.280 align:start position:0%
that access to the other buildings is
 
00:47:58.370 --> 00:47:58.380 align:start position:0%
part of it but we're not anywhere down
 
00:48:00.230 --> 00:48:00.240 align:start position:0%
the road on that thank you very much
 
00:48:00.240 --> 00:48:01.870 align:start position:0%
the road on that thank you very much
hmm

00:48:01.870 --> 00:48:01.880 align:start position:0%
hmm
 
00:48:04.490 --> 00:48:04.500 align:start position:0%
further from the committee
 
00:48:07.190 --> 00:48:07.200 align:start position:0%
represent Petrie thank you Mr chairman
 
00:48:09.410 --> 00:48:09.420 align:start position:0%
thanks for taking my question uh our
 
00:48:11.870 --> 00:48:11.880 align:start position:0%
existing lob parking uh how many is that
 
00:48:14.329 --> 00:48:14.339 align:start position:0%
hold and what's the lifespan
 
00:48:16.910 --> 00:48:16.920 align:start position:0%
the the give me the garage behind the
 
00:48:19.790 --> 00:48:19.800 align:start position:0%
lob correct oh my sense is it's about
 
00:48:22.670 --> 00:48:22.680 align:start position:0%
you have about 120 people there now
 
00:48:24.170 --> 00:48:24.180 align:start position:0%
um I don't actually know the lifespan of
 
00:48:24.180 --> 00:48:27.109 align:start position:0%
um I don't actually know the lifespan of
it

00:48:27.109 --> 00:48:27.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:28.970 --> 00:48:28.980 align:start position:0%
I think it's okay though
 
00:48:33.109 --> 00:48:33.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:34.730 --> 00:48:34.740 align:start position:0%
I don't think we have netting up
 
00:48:37.370 --> 00:48:37.380 align:start position:0%
anywhere in the yellow B garage
 
00:48:39.890 --> 00:48:39.900 align:start position:0%
any further questions for these
 
00:48:39.900 --> 00:48:42.530 align:start position:0%
any further questions for these
gentlemen

00:48:42.530 --> 00:48:42.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:45.470 --> 00:48:45.480 align:start position:0%
I would state that I am a co-sponsor
 
00:48:46.849 --> 00:48:46.859 align:start position:0%
and I
 
00:48:49.630 --> 00:48:49.640 align:start position:0%
have been here a while and have some
 
00:48:52.730 --> 00:48:52.740 align:start position:0%
timeline worth mentioning
 
00:48:52.740 --> 00:48:54.829 align:start position:0%
timeline worth mentioning
uh

00:48:54.829 --> 00:48:54.839 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:48:54.839 --> 00:48:56.210 align:start position:0%
uh
this

00:48:56.210 --> 00:48:56.220 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:48:58.730 --> 00:48:58.740 align:start position:0%
store Street Garage is a clock there
 
00:49:01.730 --> 00:49:01.740 align:start position:0%
dedicating it in 1976.
 
00:49:06.470 --> 00:49:06.480 align:start position:0%
so in 1992 it was more than 25 years old
 
00:49:09.290 --> 00:49:09.300 align:start position:0%
and perhaps needing replacement
 
00:49:12.530 --> 00:49:12.540 align:start position:0%
at the time we voted to buy this
 
00:49:15.650 --> 00:49:15.660 align:start position:0%
building that we presently consider the
 
00:49:18.290 --> 00:49:18.300 align:start position:0%
The Edge the
 
00:49:20.870 --> 00:49:20.880 align:start position:0%
Attorney General
 
00:49:22.550 --> 00:49:22.560 align:start position:0%
for about two million dollars if I
 
00:49:23.750 --> 00:49:23.760 align:start position:0%
remember right
 
00:49:26.089 --> 00:49:26.099 align:start position:0%
and the idea was this is this is right
 
00:49:28.069 --> 00:49:28.079 align:start position:0%
adjacent to us we can't let this go to
 
00:49:30.349 --> 00:49:30.359 align:start position:0%
anybody else we need this for expansion
 
00:49:32.870 --> 00:49:32.880 align:start position:0%
we're going to buy it now so it was
 
00:49:35.030 --> 00:49:35.040 align:start position:0%
okayed and we bought that from the
 
00:49:38.050 --> 00:49:38.060 align:start position:0%
Sherman bank that was moving out
 
00:49:38.060 --> 00:49:39.770 align:start position:0%
Sherman bank that was moving out
subsequently

00:49:39.770 --> 00:49:39.780 align:start position:0%
subsequently
 
00:49:41.630 --> 00:49:41.640 align:start position:0%
it's full of attorney general and
 
00:49:43.250 --> 00:49:43.260 align:start position:0%
another bank
 
00:49:47.210 --> 00:49:47.220 align:start position:0%
in 2005 I was again on a committee
 
00:49:50.390 --> 00:49:50.400 align:start position:0%
to approve a new parking garage
 
00:49:54.170 --> 00:49:54.180 align:start position:0%
and I was very dissatisfied with the
 
00:49:54.180 --> 00:49:55.609 align:start position:0%
and I was very dissatisfied with the
architect

00:49:55.609 --> 00:49:55.619 align:start position:0%
architect
 
00:49:57.770 --> 00:49:57.780 align:start position:0%
who spent all this time with the city of
 
00:49:59.809 --> 00:49:59.819 align:start position:0%
Concord and was just listening to what
 
00:50:01.190 --> 00:50:01.200 align:start position:0%
they wanted
 
00:50:02.750 --> 00:50:02.760 align:start position:0%
and even though we called it the
 
00:50:04.849 --> 00:50:04.859 align:start position:0%
legislative parking garage I was the
 
00:50:07.309 --> 00:50:07.319 align:start position:0%
only legislator there there was supposed
 
00:50:09.170 --> 00:50:09.180 align:start position:0%
to be people from public works but they
 
00:50:11.329 --> 00:50:11.339 align:start position:0%
didn't show up at the meetings
 
00:50:14.510 --> 00:50:14.520 align:start position:0%
it was also available a small lot right
 
00:50:16.730 --> 00:50:16.740 align:start position:0%
across the street from this building
 
00:50:18.710 --> 00:50:18.720 align:start position:0%
where at one time I had a parking place
 
00:50:20.990 --> 00:50:21.000 align:start position:0%
there were about 12 or 15 assigned
 
00:50:23.089 --> 00:50:23.099 align:start position:0%
parking places in that lot
 
00:50:25.430 --> 00:50:25.440 align:start position:0%
and part of the plan we looked at in
 
00:50:28.670 --> 00:50:28.680 align:start position:0%
2005 would have cleared that lot so we
 
00:50:30.290 --> 00:50:30.300 align:start position:0%
could take the people that were parking
 
00:50:32.450 --> 00:50:32.460 align:start position:0%
here and move them up over the people
 
00:50:33.890 --> 00:50:33.900 align:start position:0%
who were parking across the street to
 
00:50:36.349 --> 00:50:36.359 align:start position:0%
move them over there as we tore down the
 
00:50:39.410 --> 00:50:39.420 align:start position:0%
building it also came through again
 
00:50:41.390 --> 00:50:41.400 align:start position:0%
legislative parking garage but the
 
00:50:42.829 --> 00:50:42.839 align:start position:0%
Attorney General was asking for 20
 
00:50:44.569 --> 00:50:44.579 align:start position:0%
percent more space
 
00:50:46.490 --> 00:50:46.500 align:start position:0%
So the plan that came out they were
 
00:50:47.930 --> 00:50:47.940 align:start position:0%
going to put it right up to the sidewalk
 
00:50:49.849 --> 00:50:49.859 align:start position:0%
so they could make more room for the
 
00:50:51.650 --> 00:50:51.660 align:start position:0%
Attorney General they were going to put
 
00:50:54.109 --> 00:50:54.119 align:start position:0%
in the parking garage but because they
 
00:50:55.010 --> 00:50:55.020 align:start position:0%
were going to put it right up against
 
00:50:57.049 --> 00:50:57.059 align:start position:0%
the sidewalk they were going to close
 
00:50:59.569 --> 00:50:59.579 align:start position:0%
this Street behind us
 
00:51:02.569 --> 00:51:02.579 align:start position:0%
and I thought that's not a good idea how
 
00:51:04.670 --> 00:51:04.680 align:start position:0%
do we get to this parking behind the lob
 
00:51:07.010 --> 00:51:07.020 align:start position:0%
or we'll build a ramp off this other
 
00:51:07.020 --> 00:51:09.290 align:start position:0%
or we'll build a ramp off this other
Street

00:51:09.290 --> 00:51:09.300 align:start position:0%
Street
 
00:51:11.210 --> 00:51:11.220 align:start position:0%
what are we gonna what's that gonna cost
 
00:51:13.670 --> 00:51:13.680 align:start position:0%
well about three spaces in that lot at
 
00:51:15.290 --> 00:51:15.300 align:start position:0%
the time we were thirty three thousand
 
00:51:18.049 --> 00:51:18.059 align:start position:0%
dollars a piece for each space and of
 
00:51:20.030 --> 00:51:20.040 align:start position:0%
course it had to look fancy because that
 
00:51:21.589 --> 00:51:21.599 align:start position:0%
was what Concord wanted
 
00:51:24.049 --> 00:51:24.059 align:start position:0%
which I thought was who's leading this
 
00:51:25.970 --> 00:51:25.980 align:start position:0%
parade and then
 
00:51:28.190 --> 00:51:28.200 align:start position:0%
the speaker may remember we
 
00:51:29.329 --> 00:51:29.339 align:start position:0%
we did
 
00:51:31.430 --> 00:51:31.440 align:start position:0%
pass something that came to Public Works
 
00:51:34.849 --> 00:51:34.859 align:start position:0%
and uh the plan because of the way they
 
00:51:37.069 --> 00:51:37.079 align:start position:0%
did it and I mean looking at the
 
00:51:39.710 --> 00:51:39.720 align:start position:0%
legislature as the last person to
 
00:51:41.390 --> 00:51:41.400 align:start position:0%
have any input even though it was
 
00:51:43.130 --> 00:51:43.140 align:start position:0%
considered the legislative parking
 
00:51:43.140 --> 00:51:43.970 align:start position:0%
considered the legislative parking
garage

00:51:43.970 --> 00:51:43.980 align:start position:0%
garage
 
00:51:46.309 --> 00:51:46.319 align:start position:0%
all these other people had input so it
 
00:51:49.309 --> 00:51:49.319 align:start position:0%
failed it would have meant and the
 
00:51:51.710 --> 00:51:51.720 align:start position:0%
subsequent time that a lot that we were
 
00:51:52.849 --> 00:51:52.859 align:start position:0%
going to clear because there was a
 
00:51:54.349 --> 00:51:54.359 align:start position:0%
building there for sale
 
00:51:56.630 --> 00:51:56.640 align:start position:0%
has been sold and a brand new building
 
00:51:58.790 --> 00:51:58.800 align:start position:0%
is moored up within the last few years
 
00:52:01.609 --> 00:52:01.619 align:start position:0%
so lots of things have happened as we
 
00:52:04.069 --> 00:52:04.079 align:start position:0%
delay this and
 
00:52:05.990 --> 00:52:06.000 align:start position:0%
I remember at one point when we had to
 
00:52:08.329 --> 00:52:08.339 align:start position:0%
design it we also had to design it for
 
00:52:10.730 --> 00:52:10.740 align:start position:0%
the bank and have 15 parking places for
 
00:52:10.740 --> 00:52:11.569 align:start position:0%
the bank and have 15 parking places for
them

00:52:11.569 --> 00:52:11.579 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:52:11.579 --> 00:52:12.890 align:start position:0%
them
now

00:52:12.890 --> 00:52:12.900 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:52:14.329 --> 00:52:14.339 align:start position:0%
I don't believe there's a bank there
 
00:52:17.390 --> 00:52:17.400 align:start position:0%
anymore so that that's gone away so it
 
00:52:19.490 --> 00:52:19.500 align:start position:0%
would just be pretty much a parking
 
00:52:21.770 --> 00:52:21.780 align:start position:0%
garage there may be offices in it for
 
00:52:24.349 --> 00:52:24.359 align:start position:0%
the people in security one of the things
 
00:52:26.510 --> 00:52:26.520 align:start position:0%
I suggested at the time was to build a
 
00:52:26.520 --> 00:52:27.829 align:start position:0%
I suggested at the time was to build a
walkway

00:52:27.829 --> 00:52:27.839 align:start position:0%
walkway
 
00:52:29.690 --> 00:52:29.700 align:start position:0%
like from the second or third floor
 
00:52:32.329 --> 00:52:32.339 align:start position:0%
coming into this building so that you
 
00:52:34.010 --> 00:52:34.020 align:start position:0%
would need only one elevator the ones we
 
00:52:36.230 --> 00:52:36.240 align:start position:0%
have here and they handicapped people
 
00:52:38.569 --> 00:52:38.579 align:start position:0%
could go across that walkway
 
00:52:40.730 --> 00:52:40.740 align:start position:0%
and into access the elevators in this
 
00:52:40.740 --> 00:52:42.109 align:start position:0%
and into access the elevators in this
building

00:52:42.109 --> 00:52:42.119 align:start position:0%
building
 
00:52:44.210 --> 00:52:44.220 align:start position:0%
none of that has has happened but anyway
 
00:52:46.490 --> 00:52:46.500 align:start position:0%
I just thought I'd share that because I
 
00:52:47.809 --> 00:52:47.819 align:start position:0%
have been involved with this for some
 
00:52:49.790 --> 00:52:49.800 align:start position:0%
years and
 
00:52:53.150 --> 00:52:53.160 align:start position:0%
you can see if they decided in 92 to
 
00:52:55.430 --> 00:52:55.440 align:start position:0%
replace the parking garage why are we
 
00:52:58.430 --> 00:52:58.440 align:start position:0%
still talking about it in 2023 and when
 
00:53:01.069 --> 00:53:01.079 align:start position:0%
are we going to get going so thank you
 
00:53:02.809 --> 00:53:02.819 align:start position:0%
and I'd be happy to answer any questions
 
00:53:05.270 --> 00:53:05.280 align:start position:0%
on my experience and what what I've seen
 
00:53:06.589 --> 00:53:06.599 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:53:08.510 --> 00:53:08.520 align:start position:0%
I would assure you Mr chairman that we
 
00:53:13.849 --> 00:53:13.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:15.770 --> 00:53:15.780 align:start position:0%
you do but the city of Concord thinks
 
00:53:18.530 --> 00:53:18.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:18.540 --> 00:53:22.730 align:start position:0%
 
and

00:53:22.730 --> 00:53:22.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:25.309 --> 00:53:25.319 align:start position:0%
our chief of chief of operations Terry
 
00:53:28.010 --> 00:53:28.020 align:start position:0%
puff is here uh if you want to add
 
00:53:29.690 --> 00:53:29.700 align:start position:0%
anything you may have
 
00:53:32.089 --> 00:53:32.099 align:start position:0%
memories that I thank you Mr chairman
 
00:53:33.109 --> 00:53:33.119 align:start position:0%
members of the committee for the record
 
00:53:34.609 --> 00:53:34.619 align:start position:0%
my name is Terry Poff I'm the Chief
 
00:53:36.589 --> 00:53:36.599 align:start position:0%
Operating Officer for the general court
 
00:53:39.290 --> 00:53:39.300 align:start position:0%
for you folks as well as the senate in
 
00:53:41.329 --> 00:53:41.339 align:start position:0%
one of the jobs outlined in my position
 
00:53:43.430 --> 00:53:43.440 align:start position:0%
is long-range planning facility
 
00:53:46.930 --> 00:53:46.940 align:start position:0%
maintenance facility care among
 
00:53:50.510 --> 00:53:50.520 align:start position:0%
Administration for all joint employees
 
00:53:54.589 --> 00:53:54.599 align:start position:0%
so as a matter of History just briefly
 
00:53:56.270 --> 00:53:56.280 align:start position:0%
the store Street Garage as the speaker
 
00:53:58.069 --> 00:53:58.079 align:start position:0%
mentioned was was built for seven
 
00:54:00.290 --> 00:54:00.300 align:start position:0%
million dollars in 1975 the same time
 
00:54:02.450 --> 00:54:02.460 align:start position:0%
that the additions were put onto this
 
00:54:04.069 --> 00:54:04.079 align:start position:0%
building and this became a legislative
 
00:54:06.290 --> 00:54:06.300 align:start position:0%
office building so the LLB parking
 
00:54:09.250 --> 00:54:09.260 align:start position:0%
garage is approximately the same age
 
00:54:12.589 --> 00:54:12.599 align:start position:0%
and that is in need of repair and is
 
00:54:14.990 --> 00:54:15.000 align:start position:0%
going to get repairs done this I believe
 
00:54:17.390 --> 00:54:17.400 align:start position:0%
this summer or it's in the pipeline for
 
00:54:19.010 --> 00:54:19.020 align:start position:0%
repairs because there are things that
 
00:54:20.870 --> 00:54:20.880 align:start position:0%
are falling on cars in the lob parking
 
00:54:23.329 --> 00:54:23.339 align:start position:0%
garage as well because they're just that
 
00:54:25.549 --> 00:54:25.559 align:start position:0%
old this one was designed with a longer
 
00:54:29.630 --> 00:54:29.640 align:start position:0%
life span than the steel I-beam parking
 
00:54:31.250 --> 00:54:31.260 align:start position:0%
garage that was built down there and and
 
00:54:33.170 --> 00:54:33.180 align:start position:0%
we have an air lease with the city of
 
00:54:35.870 --> 00:54:35.880 align:start position:0%
Concord for 99 years and we've exhausted
 
00:54:38.450 --> 00:54:38.460 align:start position:0%
half of that pretty much so that's a
 
00:54:39.890 --> 00:54:39.900 align:start position:0%
little bit of the history of that garage
 
00:54:41.510 --> 00:54:41.520 align:start position:0%
and we as the speaker mentioned we put
 
00:54:44.990 --> 00:54:45.000 align:start position:0%
in 7.7 million since 1983 just in
 
00:54:47.930 --> 00:54:47.940 align:start position:0%
stabilization dollars to make sure that
 
00:54:50.089 --> 00:54:50.099 align:start position:0%
we can get an extended life out of a
 
00:54:52.069 --> 00:54:52.079 align:start position:0%
25-year building into what we are
 
00:54:53.870 --> 00:54:53.880 align:start position:0%
existing with right now
 
00:54:55.490 --> 00:54:55.500 align:start position:0%
but it
 
00:54:57.710 --> 00:54:57.720 align:start position:0%
the the pandemic did one good thing for
 
00:55:00.109 --> 00:55:00.119 align:start position:0%
us and that was reduced the use of that
 
00:55:02.510 --> 00:55:02.520 align:start position:0%
facility so with the reduction of the
 
00:55:03.950 --> 00:55:03.960 align:start position:0%
use of that facility for that length of
 
00:55:06.109 --> 00:55:06.119 align:start position:0%
time that extended the lifespan for when
 
00:55:07.549 --> 00:55:07.559 align:start position:0%
you folks came back into this building
 
00:55:09.589 --> 00:55:09.599 align:start position:0%
so just be cognizant of that they
 
00:55:12.349 --> 00:55:12.359 align:start position:0%
reduced the the use and extended the
 
00:55:13.670 --> 00:55:13.680 align:start position:0%
life so that we could get this garage
 
00:55:16.010 --> 00:55:16.020 align:start position:0%
built and as you said Mr chairman that
 
00:55:18.530 --> 00:55:18.540 align:start position:0%
piece of property in 1993 I was a public
 
00:55:20.750 --> 00:55:20.760 align:start position:0%
works member at the time myself in the
 
00:55:23.750 --> 00:55:23.760 align:start position:0%
house it was purchased and authorized
 
00:55:25.010 --> 00:55:25.020 align:start position:0%
through facilities the facilities
 
00:55:27.170 --> 00:55:27.180 align:start position:0%
Committee of the general court and it
 
00:55:29.750 --> 00:55:29.760 align:start position:0%
was purchased with collaboration with
 
00:55:31.370 --> 00:55:31.380 align:start position:0%
the city of Concord for a parking garage
 
00:55:33.710 --> 00:55:33.720 align:start position:0%
to be put there eventually because of
 
00:55:35.870 --> 00:55:35.880 align:start position:0%
the proximity to this building
 
00:55:38.870 --> 00:55:38.880 align:start position:0%
so it's it's overdue it's time it's here
 
00:55:41.329 --> 00:55:41.339 align:start position:0%
it's not a want it's a knee it's a
 
00:55:43.910 --> 00:55:43.920 align:start position:0%
necessity as the speaker explained and I
 
00:55:47.089 --> 00:55:47.099 align:start position:0%
think that's just where we are the as
 
00:55:51.049 --> 00:55:51.059 align:start position:0%
the folks from Das and DPW mentioned uh
 
00:55:54.049 --> 00:55:54.059 align:start position:0%
the costs are about fifty thousand
 
00:55:56.630 --> 00:55:56.640 align:start position:0%
dollars a space give or take and it
 
00:55:59.329 --> 00:55:59.339 align:start position:0%
depends on the design of what we find on
 
00:56:01.730 --> 00:56:01.740 align:start position:0%
that site we've done several uh to
 
00:56:01.740 --> 00:56:02.510 align:start position:0%
that site we've done several uh to
answer

00:56:02.510 --> 00:56:02.520 align:start position:0%
answer
 
00:56:04.670 --> 00:56:04.680 align:start position:0%
um I believe representative Maguire's
 
00:56:06.410 --> 00:56:06.420 align:start position:0%
questions there has been other locations
 
00:56:08.630 --> 00:56:08.640 align:start position:0%
looked at as you mentioned Mr chairman
 
00:56:10.730 --> 00:56:10.740 align:start position:0%
there's been several around this the
 
00:56:13.130 --> 00:56:13.140 align:start position:0%
State House complex looked at
 
00:56:14.990 --> 00:56:15.000 align:start position:0%
they would have required an acquisition
 
00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:16.790 align:start position:0%
they would have required an acquisition
uh

00:56:16.790 --> 00:56:16.800 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:56:19.690 --> 00:56:19.700 align:start position:0%
to acquire property and cost more money
 
00:56:22.069 --> 00:56:22.079 align:start position:0%
and they just weren't available it just
 
00:56:23.870 --> 00:56:23.880 align:start position:0%
wasn't doable at the time we actually
 
00:56:25.670 --> 00:56:25.680 align:start position:0%
had some preliminary designs on one on
 
00:56:27.170 --> 00:56:27.180 align:start position:0%
the corner that would have taken the
 
00:56:29.450 --> 00:56:29.460 align:start position:0%
pharmacy building and made it like an L
 
00:56:31.690 --> 00:56:31.700 align:start position:0%
there and it would have Incorporated
 
00:56:33.770 --> 00:56:33.780 align:start position:0%
representative Sweeney's question would
 
00:56:36.049 --> 00:56:36.059 align:start position:0%
have been Incorporated some office space
 
00:56:38.150 --> 00:56:38.160 align:start position:0%
for the general court at that point as
 
00:56:40.309 --> 00:56:40.319 align:start position:0%
well and it was a preliminary thought of
 
00:56:43.670 --> 00:56:43.680 align:start position:0%
putting some office space in at the doj
 
00:56:46.790 --> 00:56:46.800 align:start position:0%
site in conjunction with the parking
 
00:56:48.890 --> 00:56:48.900 align:start position:0%
garage but that sense because of cost
 
00:56:52.370 --> 00:56:52.380 align:start position:0%
constraints has gone asunder too
 
00:56:54.290 --> 00:56:54.300 align:start position:0%
we are at capacity in these two
 
00:56:56.750 --> 00:56:56.760 align:start position:0%
buildings as you all well know and so we
 
00:56:59.690 --> 00:56:59.700 align:start position:0%
are looking at uh innovative ways to
 
00:57:02.569 --> 00:57:02.579 align:start position:0%
house staff and membership as you know
 
00:57:04.549 --> 00:57:04.559 align:start position:0%
your committees are getting high much
 
00:57:07.010 --> 00:57:07.020 align:start position:0%
more attendance in the Committees from
 
00:57:08.750 --> 00:57:08.760 align:start position:0%
the general public and others and so
 
00:57:10.970 --> 00:57:10.980 align:start position:0%
larger rooms are sometimes needed you're
 
00:57:13.130 --> 00:57:13.140 align:start position:0%
getting moved to the the house chamber
 
00:57:15.770 --> 00:57:15.780 align:start position:0%
at times so there were thoughts at some
 
00:57:18.650 --> 00:57:18.660 align:start position:0%
point of making larger rooms that hold a
 
00:57:20.450 --> 00:57:20.460 align:start position:0%
higher capacity of people so that you
 
00:57:21.829 --> 00:57:21.839 align:start position:0%
could have hearings and the Senate could
 
00:57:24.290 --> 00:57:24.300 align:start position:0%
have hearings that have has a higher
 
00:57:26.690 --> 00:57:26.700 align:start position:0%
capacity for audience attendance
 
00:57:30.410 --> 00:57:30.420 align:start position:0%
but we're not there what we are doing is
 
00:57:32.990 --> 00:57:33.000 align:start position:0%
is acting and hopefully you folks will
 
00:57:36.410 --> 00:57:36.420 align:start position:0%
look upon this favorably and act uh to
 
00:57:39.109 --> 00:57:39.119 align:start position:0%
fill a need not a want this is a
 
00:57:39.119 --> 00:57:40.430 align:start position:0%
fill a need not a want this is a
necessity

00:57:40.430 --> 00:57:40.440 align:start position:0%
necessity
 
00:57:42.109 --> 00:57:42.119 align:start position:0%
and with that I'll gladly answer any
 
00:57:44.930 --> 00:57:44.940 align:start position:0%
questions you may have
 
00:57:46.849 --> 00:57:46.859 align:start position:0%
all right you have 35 more minutes to
 
00:57:49.910 --> 00:57:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:50.990 --> 00:57:51.000 align:start position:0%
questions from the members
 
00:57:53.690 --> 00:57:53.700 align:start position:0%
representative papovich thank you Mr
 
00:57:55.130 --> 00:57:55.140 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking the
 
00:57:57.170 --> 00:57:57.180 align:start position:0%
questions would you be able to provide
 
00:57:59.870 --> 00:57:59.880 align:start position:0%
us with a you know proforma analysis of
 
00:58:02.690 --> 00:58:02.700 align:start position:0%
the costs of each trying to extend the
 
00:58:05.390 --> 00:58:05.400 align:start position:0%
life of the you know stores garage which
 
00:58:07.790 --> 00:58:07.800 align:start position:0%
is currently on life support versus you
 
00:58:09.170 --> 00:58:09.180 align:start position:0%
know obviously we understand what the
 
00:58:11.569 --> 00:58:11.579 align:start position:0%
costs are for replacing it but just to
 
00:58:14.210 --> 00:58:14.220 align:start position:0%
evaluate you know what may happen in
 
00:58:16.370 --> 00:58:16.380 align:start position:0%
both scenario in terms of dollars we'd
 
00:58:18.770 --> 00:58:18.780 align:start position:0%
have to spend the cost of extending it
 
00:58:20.690 --> 00:58:20.700 align:start position:0%
is pretty much Demolition and rebuilding
 
00:58:23.690 --> 00:58:23.700 align:start position:0%
if you can if you want to rebuild but in
 
00:58:25.309 --> 00:58:25.319 align:start position:0%
conjunction with the city of concord's
 
00:58:27.349 --> 00:58:27.359 align:start position:0%
Master Plan their master plan doesn't
 
00:58:29.750 --> 00:58:29.760 align:start position:0%
include that garage being there to be
 
00:58:31.069 --> 00:58:31.079 align:start position:0%
honest with you and there they have a
 
00:58:33.370 --> 00:58:33.380 align:start position:0%
master plan that's redoing that whole
 
00:58:36.490 --> 00:58:36.500 align:start position:0%
store Street section that goes clear to
 
00:58:38.750 --> 00:58:38.760 align:start position:0%
Horseshoe Pond so that's going to be
 
00:58:41.390 --> 00:58:41.400 align:start position:0%
like the Gateway into Concord so we
 
00:58:43.490 --> 00:58:43.500 align:start position:0%
collaborate in the city of Concord are
 
00:58:45.349 --> 00:58:45.359 align:start position:0%
our partners really in this because we
 
00:58:47.210 --> 00:58:47.220 align:start position:0%
are here they're our neighbors we work
 
00:58:50.450 --> 00:58:50.460 align:start position:0%
with them so the extension of life is is
 
00:58:52.910 --> 00:58:52.920 align:start position:0%
not really feasible thank you for that
 
00:58:52.920 --> 00:58:56.210 align:start position:0%
not really feasible thank you for that
property

00:58:56.210 --> 00:58:56.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:57.829 --> 00:58:57.839 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire and then
 
00:58:57.839 --> 00:58:59.870 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire and then
representative

00:58:59.870 --> 00:58:59.880 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:59:01.730 --> 00:59:01.740 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
00:59:03.470 --> 00:59:03.480 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:59:05.510 --> 00:59:05.520 align:start position:0%
um I've heard various numbers of the
 
00:59:07.430 --> 00:59:07.440 align:start position:0%
size of the garage we're targeting here
 
00:59:11.030 --> 00:59:11.040 align:start position:0%
at 450 600 other numbers what what
 
00:59:12.589 --> 00:59:12.599 align:start position:0%
actually is it
 
00:59:14.870 --> 00:59:14.880 align:start position:0%
what is the actual number of the spaces
 
00:59:17.150 --> 00:59:17.160 align:start position:0%
the number of spaces the need for the
 
00:59:19.010 --> 00:59:19.020 align:start position:0%
space for the 25 million dollars and the
 
00:59:20.990 --> 00:59:21.000 align:start position:0%
25 million dollars can be approximately
 
00:59:25.309 --> 00:59:25.319 align:start position:0%
uh what was the 450 for 22. 400 for 22
 
00:59:26.569 --> 00:59:26.579 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
00:59:29.270 --> 00:59:29.280 align:start position:0%
is what the the need the need is 400
 
00:59:32.569 --> 00:59:32.579 align:start position:0%
minimum the desire would be to have some
 
00:59:33.950 --> 00:59:33.960 align:start position:0%
more so we could accommodate our
 
00:59:36.470 --> 00:59:36.480 align:start position:0%
partners over at the Das and the Annex
 
00:59:38.450 --> 00:59:38.460 align:start position:0%
Building because they have a genuine
 
00:59:40.130 --> 00:59:40.140 align:start position:0%
need for parking too and you have to
 
00:59:41.569 --> 00:59:41.579 align:start position:0%
understand that folks that work down
 
00:59:43.250 --> 00:59:43.260 align:start position:0%
down here and they're they're doing
 
00:59:45.829 --> 00:59:45.839 align:start position:0%
Public Service in this not only on our
 
00:59:47.990 --> 00:59:48.000 align:start position:0%
Branch but in the other branches parking
 
00:59:50.750 --> 00:59:50.760 align:start position:0%
is a genuine concern and it it's a
 
00:59:52.490 --> 00:59:52.500 align:start position:0%
genuine problem for retention of
 
00:59:54.289 --> 00:59:54.299 align:start position:0%
employees quite frankly and even initial
 
00:59:57.170 --> 00:59:57.180 align:start position:0%
hiring so when you look at those parking
 
00:59:59.870 --> 00:59:59.880 align:start position:0%
it's not just to park the car it's to
 
01:00:03.109 --> 01:00:03.119 align:start position:0%
retain and recruit employees
 
01:00:05.390 --> 01:00:05.400 align:start position:0%
to make the process work here and also
 
01:00:07.250 --> 01:00:07.260 align:start position:0%
to for government in general and even
 
01:00:09.289 --> 01:00:09.299 align:start position:0%
private practice and Private Industry
 
01:00:11.990 --> 01:00:12.000 align:start position:0%
follow it follow-up yeah along those
 
01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:13.190 align:start position:0%
follow it follow-up yeah along those
lines

01:00:13.190 --> 01:00:13.200 align:start position:0%
lines
 
01:00:13.200 --> 01:00:13.789 align:start position:0%
lines
um

01:00:13.789 --> 01:00:13.799 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:00:17.630 --> 01:00:17.640 align:start position:0%
how many employees of the state work in
 
01:00:19.970 --> 01:00:19.980 align:start position:0%
this Capital Area I mean there's also
 
01:00:22.130 --> 01:00:22.140 align:start position:0%
the State Library other places and where
 
01:00:24.829 --> 01:00:24.839 align:start position:0%
do they Park we have different lots and
 
01:00:26.690 --> 01:00:26.700 align:start position:0%
different surface parking around and
 
01:00:28.450 --> 01:00:28.460 align:start position:0%
then we have accommodations
 
01:00:30.890 --> 01:00:30.900 align:start position:0%
within the different divisions and I
 
01:00:32.210 --> 01:00:32.220 align:start position:0%
can't speak for the executive branch
 
01:00:34.910 --> 01:00:34.920 align:start position:0%
exclusively only our Branch but we have
 
01:00:37.609 --> 01:00:37.619 align:start position:0%
surface parking behind the library that
 
01:00:38.750 --> 01:00:38.760 align:start position:0%
we have some of our legislative
 
01:00:40.910 --> 01:00:40.920 align:start position:0%
employees housed in we have surface
 
01:00:43.069 --> 01:00:43.079 align:start position:0%
parking on green and School Street
 
01:00:44.569 --> 01:00:44.579 align:start position:0%
behind the boiler plant we actually
 
01:00:48.349 --> 01:00:48.359 align:start position:0%
relinquished spaces in that lot for
 
01:00:51.049 --> 01:00:51.059 align:start position:0%
several things four spaces for Ev
 
01:00:53.150 --> 01:00:53.160 align:start position:0%
vehicles to have EV charges were the
 
01:00:55.069 --> 01:00:55.079 align:start position:0%
first places to do that we're kind of
 
01:00:56.510 --> 01:00:56.520 align:start position:0%
leading the way in that because some of
 
01:00:58.190 --> 01:00:58.200 align:start position:0%
our members in the general court
 
01:01:00.470 --> 01:01:00.480 align:start position:0%
actually had some EVs and general public
 
01:01:02.630 --> 01:01:02.640 align:start position:0%
can use that as well we relinquish
 
01:01:05.270 --> 01:01:05.280 align:start position:0%
spaces to actually create and put the
 
01:01:06.829 --> 01:01:06.839 align:start position:0%
Boiler House there we even had some
 
01:01:08.510 --> 01:01:08.520 align:start position:0%
preliminary designs to put the boiler
 
01:01:10.430 --> 01:01:10.440 align:start position:0%
the boilers to feed this area after
 
01:01:12.049 --> 01:01:12.059 align:start position:0%
Concord steam went down in the basement
 
01:01:16.849 --> 01:01:16.859 align:start position:0%
of a design of the garage on the doj
 
01:01:21.710 --> 01:01:21.720 align:start position:0%
site so we have doj site spaces for doj
 
01:01:24.049 --> 01:01:24.059 align:start position:0%
employees and executive Branch employees
 
01:01:25.789 --> 01:01:25.799 align:start position:0%
as well as legislative employees and
 
01:01:27.710 --> 01:01:27.720 align:start position:0%
members so we're
 
01:01:31.190 --> 01:01:31.200 align:start position:0%
patchworked around for folks to to park
 
01:01:33.710 --> 01:01:33.720 align:start position:0%
and then we also have parking cards that
 
01:01:37.549 --> 01:01:37.559 align:start position:0%
we provide as a service for parking on
 
01:01:39.770 --> 01:01:39.780 align:start position:0%
city streets as well and then we have an
 
01:01:41.870 --> 01:01:41.880 align:start position:0%
agreement with the city to use surface
 
01:01:44.270 --> 01:01:44.280 align:start position:0%
parking for handicapped folks on Park
 
01:01:48.170 --> 01:01:48.180 align:start position:0%
Street on North State and um and Capitol
 
01:01:50.210 --> 01:01:50.220 align:start position:0%
street so we're
 
01:01:52.250 --> 01:01:52.260 align:start position:0%
we're sprawled all over the place and
 
01:01:55.069 --> 01:01:55.079 align:start position:0%
and is when you have some members able
 
01:01:56.930 --> 01:01:56.940 align:start position:0%
to park here and members of the House in
 
01:01:58.250 --> 01:01:58.260 align:start position:0%
the Senate able to park here but the
 
01:01:59.630 --> 01:01:59.640 align:start position:0%
Senate pretty much is in this contained
 
01:02:01.069 --> 01:02:01.079 align:start position:0%
in this area because there's so few of
 
01:02:02.870 --> 01:02:02.880 align:start position:0%
them but the house members really you
 
01:02:05.210 --> 01:02:05.220 align:start position:0%
have half of your body part a distance
 
01:02:07.370 --> 01:02:07.380 align:start position:0%
away and with that average age of our
 
01:02:09.890 --> 01:02:09.900 align:start position:0%
membership these days about 63 and a
 
01:02:11.089 --> 01:02:11.099 align:start position:0%
half and that's because we have some 18
 
01:02:13.849 --> 01:02:13.859 align:start position:0%
and 20 year olds quite frankly so and we
 
01:02:17.210 --> 01:02:17.220 align:start position:0%
be so we uh you know that's not exactly
 
01:02:19.309 --> 01:02:19.319 align:start position:0%
an ideal situation for anybody because
 
01:02:21.410 --> 01:02:21.420 align:start position:0%
you have two classes as a former speaker
 
01:02:23.450 --> 01:02:23.460 align:start position:0%
Jasper and current commissioner has said
 
01:02:25.370 --> 01:02:25.380 align:start position:0%
before it's two classes of legislators
 
01:02:27.589 --> 01:02:27.599 align:start position:0%
the ones that park close to the Capitol
 
01:02:29.750 --> 01:02:29.760 align:start position:0%
complex and the others that are footing
 
01:02:32.030 --> 01:02:32.040 align:start position:0%
it from uh from a distance and quite
 
01:02:34.250 --> 01:02:34.260 align:start position:0%
honestly it's it's uh it storms like
 
01:02:36.410 --> 01:02:36.420 align:start position:0%
this it's not it's dangerous for folks
 
01:02:38.390 --> 01:02:38.400 align:start position:0%
to be quite honest and they're serving
 
01:02:38.400 --> 01:02:39.589 align:start position:0%
to be quite honest and they're serving
for

01:02:39.589 --> 01:02:39.599 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:02:42.829 --> 01:02:42.839 align:start position:0%
um as basically volunteers here so we
 
01:02:46.010 --> 01:02:46.020 align:start position:0%
want to do what's safe for them
 
01:02:48.530 --> 01:02:48.540 align:start position:0%
um one more I I didn't quite hear a
 
01:02:51.470 --> 01:02:51.480 align:start position:0%
number in there is is uh 400 is the uh
 
01:02:56.270 --> 01:02:56.280 align:start position:0%
is the minimum goal no no about how many
 
01:02:59.089 --> 01:02:59.099 align:start position:0%
um employees we currently have how many
 
01:03:01.309 --> 01:03:01.319 align:start position:0%
employees we currently have we have 126
 
01:03:03.289 --> 01:03:03.299 align:start position:0%
full-time employees and about 44
 
01:03:05.870 --> 01:03:05.880 align:start position:0%
part-time employees so is that 160
 
01:03:07.490 --> 01:03:07.500 align:start position:0%
spaces or
 
01:03:08.990 --> 01:03:09.000 align:start position:0%
that are scattered around scattered
 
01:03:11.270 --> 01:03:11.280 align:start position:0%
around as well as as well as the 424
 
01:03:14.450 --> 01:03:14.460 align:start position:0%
members gotcha thank you
 
01:03:16.370 --> 01:03:16.380 align:start position:0%
I can remember when everybody had a
 
01:03:18.289 --> 01:03:18.299 align:start position:0%
handful of quarters and they had to run
 
01:03:20.089 --> 01:03:20.099 align:start position:0%
out every couple hours and put them in
 
01:03:22.549 --> 01:03:22.559 align:start position:0%
the parking meters and now they've got
 
01:03:24.589 --> 01:03:24.599 align:start position:0%
the kiosk but it's the same deal you got
 
01:03:26.210 --> 01:03:26.220 align:start position:0%
to keep running out and getting another
 
01:03:28.010 --> 01:03:28.020 align:start position:0%
one representative Heath real quick
 
01:03:29.870 --> 01:03:29.880 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
01:03:31.430 --> 01:03:31.440 align:start position:0%
um is there a cost
 
01:03:34.970 --> 01:03:34.980 align:start position:0%
um to the um to the House and Senate
 
01:03:37.970 --> 01:03:37.980 align:start position:0%
um in the body for using all these
 
01:03:41.569 --> 01:03:41.579 align:start position:0%
spaces from Concord I I would think that
 
01:03:43.370 --> 01:03:43.380 align:start position:0%
um just knowing that everybody has a
 
01:03:46.250 --> 01:03:46.260 align:start position:0%
tech space and parking is one of those
 
01:03:48.650 --> 01:03:48.660 align:start position:0%
revenues that people count on is there
 
01:03:51.770 --> 01:03:51.780 align:start position:0%
an agreement with with this body and the
 
01:03:54.530 --> 01:03:54.540 align:start position:0%
City of Concord for payment of some sort
 
01:03:56.510 --> 01:03:56.520 align:start position:0%
as I said the general court is a good
 
01:03:58.130 --> 01:03:58.140 align:start position:0%
neighbor and the Concord city of Concord
 
01:04:00.109 --> 01:04:00.119 align:start position:0%
is a good neighbor with us as well so we
 
01:04:02.210 --> 01:04:02.220 align:start position:0%
have an agreement and they've authorized
 
01:04:03.829 --> 01:04:03.839 align:start position:0%
us a certain number of spaces on the
 
01:04:06.650 --> 01:04:06.660 align:start position:0%
streets and as well as what Concord does
 
01:04:08.150 --> 01:04:08.160 align:start position:0%
they have an ordinance that allows
 
01:04:10.549 --> 01:04:10.559 align:start position:0%
handicapped folks to park uh with no
 
01:04:12.530 --> 01:04:12.540 align:start position:0%
cost either so if they have a hand a
 
01:04:14.870 --> 01:04:14.880 align:start position:0%
hand a hang tag they can park there as
 
01:04:17.150 --> 01:04:17.160 align:start position:0%
well at any City space but we have a
 
01:04:19.250 --> 01:04:19.260 align:start position:0%
particular agreement and a special
 
01:04:20.930 --> 01:04:20.940 align:start position:0%
agreement with the city of Concord for
 
01:04:22.970 --> 01:04:22.980 align:start position:0%
those spaces around the capital complex
 
01:04:25.309 --> 01:04:25.319 align:start position:0%
that we consume on a regular basis and
 
01:04:27.710 --> 01:04:27.720 align:start position:0%
we are cognitive of the fact cognitive
 
01:04:30.970 --> 01:04:30.980 align:start position:0%
of the fact uh Revenue issues so we on
 
01:04:33.890 --> 01:04:33.900 align:start position:0%
mask you know how we have the the bags
 
01:04:36.470 --> 01:04:36.480 align:start position:0%
and the cones we remove those as soon as
 
01:04:38.329 --> 01:04:38.339 align:start position:0%
we can when we know the need's not there
 
01:04:40.549 --> 01:04:40.559 align:start position:0%
so we watched that constantly we're
 
01:04:42.530 --> 01:04:42.540 align:start position:0%
sensitive to the fact that it's a
 
01:04:44.150 --> 01:04:44.160 align:start position:0%
revenue stream for the city and that
 
01:04:45.530 --> 01:04:45.540 align:start position:0%
they're generous to give us those things
 
01:04:48.589 --> 01:04:48.599 align:start position:0%
so we we appreciate it and we appreciate
 
01:04:51.230 --> 01:04:51.240 align:start position:0%
our neighbors to the to just to the west
 
01:04:56.089 --> 01:04:56.099 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:57.950 --> 01:04:57.960 align:start position:0%
representative Murray for a question
 
01:05:01.329 --> 01:05:01.339 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker I am not at all
 
01:05:03.289 --> 01:05:03.299 align:start position:0%
competent in construction and all that
 
01:05:04.609 --> 01:05:04.619 align:start position:0%
but I'm curious when you're trying to
 
01:05:06.710 --> 01:05:06.720 align:start position:0%
figure out the number of spaces that
 
01:05:08.390 --> 01:05:08.400 align:start position:0%
this could have going from smaller to
 
01:05:10.250 --> 01:05:10.260 align:start position:0%
the larger is there any sense of looking
 
01:05:12.470 --> 01:05:12.480 align:start position:0%
at economy of scale of having you know
 
01:05:14.329 --> 01:05:14.339 align:start position:0%
if you have the more spaces would that
 
01:05:16.910 --> 01:05:16.920 align:start position:0%
reduce the 5 50k that you're proposing
 
01:05:20.210 --> 01:05:20.220 align:start position:0%
per space or is that the range of that
 
01:05:21.589 --> 01:05:21.599 align:start position:0%
still so small that it wouldn't have any
 
01:05:23.750 --> 01:05:23.760 align:start position:0%
impact on the cost per space no they
 
01:05:24.950 --> 01:05:24.960 align:start position:0%
actually have brought that up when we
 
01:05:26.049 --> 01:05:26.059 align:start position:0%
had our
 
01:05:28.309 --> 01:05:28.319 align:start position:0%
pre-architectural meetings with the
 
01:05:29.870 --> 01:05:29.880 align:start position:0%
architect and stuff they said there is a
 
01:05:32.329 --> 01:05:32.339 align:start position:0%
sweet spot um for the decks because each
 
01:05:34.069 --> 01:05:34.079 align:start position:0%
deck can carry so many and it depends on
 
01:05:36.470 --> 01:05:36.480 align:start position:0%
how much you consume of that site so
 
01:05:39.530 --> 01:05:39.540 align:start position:0%
there are architectural parameters that
 
01:05:41.870 --> 01:05:41.880 align:start position:0%
create the sweet spot for the cost and
 
01:05:43.069 --> 01:05:43.079 align:start position:0%
they're going to look into those but
 
01:05:46.010 --> 01:05:46.020 align:start position:0%
quite honestly when you as the as the
 
01:05:47.510 --> 01:05:47.520 align:start position:0%
commissioner mentioned I believe or or
 
01:05:48.730 --> 01:05:48.740 align:start position:0%
the director
 
01:05:51.950 --> 01:05:51.960 align:start position:0%
this is a wet spot it's a they don't
 
01:05:54.650 --> 01:05:54.660 align:start position:0%
call it Spring Street by chance it's for
 
01:05:58.069 --> 01:05:58.079 align:start position:0%
a reason so nine on a drought year when
 
01:06:00.230 --> 01:06:00.240 align:start position:0%
we had some drilling done over there in
 
01:06:02.210 --> 01:06:02.220 align:start position:0%
the past it's been they went down nine
 
01:06:05.150 --> 01:06:05.160 align:start position:0%
feet in a drought season in August and
 
01:06:07.309 --> 01:06:07.319 align:start position:0%
they hit water almost Artesian type
 
01:06:10.309 --> 01:06:10.319 align:start position:0%
water at 9.8 feet so it's pretty wet
 
01:06:13.010 --> 01:06:13.020 align:start position:0%
around here and so it makes for a poor
 
01:06:14.690 --> 01:06:14.700 align:start position:0%
construction site but a great site
 
01:06:18.589 --> 01:06:18.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:20.990 --> 01:06:21.000 align:start position:0%
representative leishman for a question
 
01:06:23.270 --> 01:06:23.280 align:start position:0%
thanks Mr chairman and thanks for taking
 
01:06:25.670 --> 01:06:25.680 align:start position:0%
my question it's kind of a follow-up to
 
01:06:27.950 --> 01:06:27.960 align:start position:0%
representative Heath the number of
 
01:06:30.230 --> 01:06:30.240 align:start position:0%
spaces that we have around the lob in a
 
01:06:32.089 --> 01:06:32.099 align:start position:0%
state house that are occupied are given
 
01:06:34.370 --> 01:06:34.380 align:start position:0%
to us if you will by the city will any
 
01:06:37.069 --> 01:06:37.079 align:start position:0%
of those spaces be returned back if the
 
01:06:39.650 --> 01:06:39.660 align:start position:0%
parking garage is built we anticipate
 
01:06:42.650 --> 01:06:42.660 align:start position:0%
that yes a lot of them will be returned
 
01:06:45.650 --> 01:06:45.660 align:start position:0%
back we'll keep a minimum amount around
 
01:06:48.849 --> 01:06:48.859 align:start position:0%
um the base of the of the capital itself
 
01:06:51.650 --> 01:06:51.660 align:start position:0%
but most of the other parking will all
 
01:06:53.270 --> 01:06:53.280 align:start position:0%
be accommodated within the new structure
 
01:06:56.150 --> 01:06:56.160 align:start position:0%
and the new structure will have uh it's
 
01:06:57.890 --> 01:06:57.900 align:start position:0%
going to be a requirement it is in
 
01:07:01.430 --> 01:07:01.440 align:start position:0%
design really for Ev spaces for handicap
 
01:07:04.609 --> 01:07:04.619 align:start position:0%
spaces and several other minimum
 
01:07:04.619 --> 01:07:05.809 align:start position:0%
spaces and several other minimum
requirements

01:07:05.809 --> 01:07:05.819 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
01:07:08.510 --> 01:07:08.520 align:start position:0%
you know modern day garages or modern
 
01:07:10.250 --> 01:07:10.260 align:start position:0%
day garages that they've have control
 
01:07:12.829 --> 01:07:12.839 align:start position:0%
points uh camera systems the whole bit
 
01:07:15.109 --> 01:07:15.119 align:start position:0%
because security is becoming and always
 
01:07:16.970 --> 01:07:16.980 align:start position:0%
has been a Paramount but when you build
 
01:07:18.349 --> 01:07:18.359 align:start position:0%
something new you need this secure
 
01:07:22.370 --> 01:07:22.380 align:start position:0%
facility thank you thank you Mr chairman
 
01:07:26.890 --> 01:07:26.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:29.170 --> 01:07:29.180 align:start position:0%
your title
 
01:07:31.549 --> 01:07:31.559 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure I gave you the correct time
 
01:07:33.230 --> 01:07:33.240 align:start position:0%
it's Chief Operating Officer for the
 
01:07:35.089 --> 01:07:35.099 align:start position:0%
general court
 
01:07:39.529 --> 01:07:39.539 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:41.270 --> 01:07:41.280 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else that would like to
 
01:07:44.089 --> 01:07:44.099 align:start position:0%
say anything about this proposal on
 
01:07:48.230 --> 01:07:48.240 align:start position:0%
House Bill 384. Mr three wait a minute I
 
01:07:49.490 --> 01:07:49.500 align:start position:0%
got the number wrong
 
01:07:51.650 --> 01:07:51.660 align:start position:0%
384 yes that's it
 
01:07:53.150 --> 01:07:53.160 align:start position:0%
all right
 
01:07:55.190 --> 01:07:55.200 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire you have a
 
01:08:01.910 --> 01:08:01.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:04.490 --> 01:08:04.500 align:start position:0%
uh so thank you Mr chairman and just
 
01:08:07.069 --> 01:08:07.079 align:start position:0%
along the lines of of your own little
 
01:08:09.289 --> 01:08:09.299 align:start position:0%
talk here I wanted to just
 
01:08:12.170 --> 01:08:12.180 align:start position:0%
and give my perspective um I heard you
 
01:08:14.029 --> 01:08:14.039 align:start position:0%
say that when you were studying this
 
01:08:16.490 --> 01:08:16.500 align:start position:0%
problem in the past you were looking at
 
01:08:18.410 --> 01:08:18.420 align:start position:0%
parking garages that cost thirty three
 
01:08:21.050 --> 01:08:21.060 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars a space
 
01:08:23.689 --> 01:08:23.699 align:start position:0%
what we're looking at today 35 million
 
01:08:27.410 --> 01:08:27.420 align:start position:0%
dollars for 450 spaces or 400 spaces or
 
01:08:29.570 --> 01:08:29.580 align:start position:0%
whatever that's more like seventy five
 
01:08:31.550 --> 01:08:31.560 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars a space
 
01:08:33.590 --> 01:08:33.600 align:start position:0%
and I just have a mental disconnect
 
01:08:36.769 --> 01:08:36.779 align:start position:0%
because you know I paid under thirteen
 
01:08:39.169 --> 01:08:39.179 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars for my car
 
01:08:42.410 --> 01:08:42.420 align:start position:0%
a few years ago you know so so you know
 
01:08:46.010 --> 01:08:46.020 align:start position:0%
parking that car in a 75 000 space just
 
01:08:48.169 --> 01:08:48.179 align:start position:0%
seems crazy that's my problem I heard
 
01:08:51.349 --> 01:08:51.359 align:start position:0%
fifty five thousand
 
01:08:54.470 --> 01:08:54.480 align:start position:0%
of roughly 50.
 
01:08:56.390 --> 01:08:56.400 align:start position:0%
for the actual construction the entire
 
01:08:59.090 --> 01:08:59.100 align:start position:0%
project right yeah yeah yeah and that's
 
01:09:00.829 --> 01:09:00.839 align:start position:0%
you know and that's per so that's about
 
01:09:02.749 --> 01:09:02.759 align:start position:0%
50 000 per space
 
01:09:04.130 --> 01:09:04.140 align:start position:0%
and of course there's been a lot of
 
01:09:07.249 --> 01:09:07.259 align:start position:0%
inflation since 2005. even more in the
 
01:09:10.130 --> 01:09:10.140 align:start position:0%
last year yeah so everything is going to
 
01:09:11.689 --> 01:09:11.699 align:start position:0%
be more expensive and then we're also
 
01:09:14.269 --> 01:09:14.279 align:start position:0%
going to hear about problems getting the
 
01:09:17.030 --> 01:09:17.040 align:start position:0%
building materials so
 
01:09:19.309 --> 01:09:19.319 align:start position:0%
yeah the sooner we get to it you can see
 
01:09:21.590 --> 01:09:21.600 align:start position:0%
how much it's cost when I think my
 
01:09:24.590 --> 01:09:24.600 align:start position:0%
recollection the speaker may have
 
01:09:26.930 --> 01:09:26.940 align:start position:0%
remembered 92. I think we bought this
 
01:09:29.689 --> 01:09:29.699 align:start position:0%
building for 2 million maybe two point
 
01:09:31.669 --> 01:09:31.679 align:start position:0%
something million but it
 
01:09:43.189 --> 01:09:43.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:46.370 --> 01:09:46.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:49.910 --> 01:09:49.920 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards for a question uh
 
01:09:52.729 --> 01:09:52.739 align:start position:0%
yes sir thank you Mr chair I I I just
 
01:09:56.390 --> 01:09:56.400 align:start position:0%
need a mental refresh I I thought we did
 
01:10:00.470 --> 01:10:00.480 align:start position:0%
something in hb2 that arranged for this
 
01:10:02.510 --> 01:10:02.520 align:start position:0%
garage to be built and at least
 
01:10:05.990 --> 01:10:06.000 align:start position:0%
partially funded and and and to
 
01:10:08.510 --> 01:10:08.520 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire's point I hope
 
01:10:10.610 --> 01:10:10.620 align:start position:0%
the parking spot lasts longer than your
 
01:10:14.209 --> 01:10:14.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:16.850 --> 01:10:16.860 align:start position:0%
yes I think we did put money in hb2 but
 
01:10:19.430 --> 01:10:19.440 align:start position:0%
I don't think it anything is is moved
 
01:10:19.440 --> 01:10:21.410 align:start position:0%
I don't think it anything is is moved
forward

01:10:21.410 --> 01:10:21.420 align:start position:0%
forward
 
01:10:22.850 --> 01:10:22.860 align:start position:0%
so my point there is I'm a little
 
01:10:25.669 --> 01:10:25.679 align:start position:0%
confused why why we keep coming back to
 
01:10:27.110 --> 01:10:27.120 align:start position:0%
this issue I thought it was a dead
 
01:10:27.120 --> 01:10:29.229 align:start position:0%
this issue I thought it was a dead
letter

01:10:29.229 --> 01:10:29.239 align:start position:0%
letter
 
01:10:33.890 --> 01:10:33.900 align:start position:0%
if I may Mr chairman the money we put in
 
01:10:36.410 --> 01:10:36.420 align:start position:0%
last session representative Edwards was
 
01:10:39.290 --> 01:10:39.300 align:start position:0%
for the move for the Department of
 
01:10:39.300 --> 01:10:40.250 align:start position:0%
for the move for the Department of
Justice

01:10:40.250 --> 01:10:40.260 align:start position:0%
Justice
 
01:10:42.229 --> 01:10:42.239 align:start position:0%
to move over to the building that
 
01:10:43.910 --> 01:10:43.920 align:start position:0%
they're currently going built building
 
01:10:46.310 --> 01:10:46.320 align:start position:0%
out the space for them to move into
 
01:10:48.890 --> 01:10:48.900 align:start position:0%
it also had money in there for the
 
01:10:51.830 --> 01:10:51.840 align:start position:0%
preliminary tear down of the doj
 
01:10:55.370 --> 01:10:55.380 align:start position:0%
and doing the architectural work for the
 
01:10:57.950 --> 01:10:57.960 align:start position:0%
garage itself that was all combined into
 
01:11:00.649 --> 01:11:00.659 align:start position:0%
I think was 9.5 million
 
01:11:02.510 --> 01:11:02.520 align:start position:0%
that had nothing to do with the actual
 
01:11:05.149 --> 01:11:05.159 align:start position:0%
construction of the garage itself
 
01:11:06.890 --> 01:11:06.900 align:start position:0%
we didn't have
 
01:11:10.550 --> 01:11:10.560 align:start position:0%
good enough numbers last year on the
 
01:11:12.770 --> 01:11:12.780 align:start position:0%
actual construction so we didn't ask for
 
01:11:15.229 --> 01:11:15.239 align:start position:0%
any money and that's why we're coming
 
01:11:17.450 --> 01:11:17.460 align:start position:0%
back this year to ask for the money for
 
01:11:19.910 --> 01:11:19.920 align:start position:0%
the actual construction of the garage
 
01:11:22.130 --> 01:11:22.140 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chair thank you Mr
 
01:11:22.140 --> 01:11:25.550 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chair thank you Mr
Speaker

in digging through some
 
01:13:19.729 --> 01:13:19.739 align:start position:0%
old material I found some architectural
 
01:13:21.890 --> 01:13:21.900 align:start position:0%
rendering that I will add to their
 
01:13:25.070 --> 01:13:25.080 align:start position:0%
pictures of this fancy building that
 
01:13:27.169 --> 01:13:27.179 align:start position:0%
would have been put over here in the
 
01:13:29.450 --> 01:13:29.460 align:start position:0%
elimination of traffic on this street
 
01:13:32.390 --> 01:13:32.400 align:start position:0%
behind us so it might be worthy of a
 
01:13:33.410 --> 01:13:33.420 align:start position:0%
look for
 
01:13:35.270 --> 01:13:35.280 align:start position:0%
an expensive project that was even
 
01:13:38.930 --> 01:13:38.940 align:start position:0%
turned down in 2005.
 
01:13:41.270 --> 01:13:41.280 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker anything further
 
01:13:44.149 --> 01:13:44.159 align:start position:0%
if if I just answer representative
 
01:13:46.729 --> 01:13:46.739 align:start position:0%
zoleski's question on the handicapped
 
01:13:48.890 --> 01:13:48.900 align:start position:0%
every year
 
01:13:51.830 --> 01:13:51.840 align:start position:0%
that those of us that have done parking
 
01:13:53.930 --> 01:13:53.940 align:start position:0%
it's been an absolute nightmare because
 
01:13:57.649 --> 01:13:57.659 align:start position:0%
every year we have more and more people
 
01:14:00.410 --> 01:14:00.420 align:start position:0%
that need handicapped parking spaces
 
01:14:02.930 --> 01:14:02.940 align:start position:0%
and we have to leave about five or six
 
01:14:04.850 --> 01:14:04.860 align:start position:0%
open for those that might need a
 
01:14:07.370 --> 01:14:07.380 align:start position:0%
temporary one whether it be an accident
 
01:14:09.830 --> 01:14:09.840 align:start position:0%
or something of that nature so we always
 
01:14:12.350 --> 01:14:12.360 align:start position:0%
have five or six left open which we've
 
01:14:13.729 --> 01:14:13.739 align:start position:0%
already filled three of them I think
 
01:14:14.750 --> 01:14:14.760 align:start position:0%
this year
 
01:14:16.550 --> 01:14:16.560 align:start position:0%
you know for people that have had
 
01:14:18.350 --> 01:14:18.360 align:start position:0%
handicapped things that might only last
 
01:14:20.810 --> 01:14:20.820 align:start position:0%
for three or four months uh it's a
 
01:14:23.090 --> 01:14:23.100 align:start position:0%
nightmare uh it's not going to get any
 
01:14:23.100 --> 01:14:23.870 align:start position:0%
nightmare uh it's not going to get any
better

01:14:23.870 --> 01:14:23.880 align:start position:0%
better
 
01:14:26.570 --> 01:14:26.580 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:14:28.550 --> 01:14:28.560 align:start position:0%
unfortunately sometimes people come to
 
01:14:29.750 --> 01:14:29.760 align:start position:0%
us and we don't have any place to put
 
01:14:34.310 --> 01:14:34.320 align:start position:0%
them so so building this will eliminate
 
01:14:39.050 --> 01:14:39.060 align:start position:0%
that particular problem uh but um at the
 
01:14:39.060 --> 01:14:40.130 align:start position:0%
that particular problem uh but um at the
current

01:14:40.130 --> 01:14:40.140 align:start position:0%
current
 
01:14:42.590 --> 01:14:42.600 align:start position:0%
rate we're doing things right now
 
01:14:44.810 --> 01:14:44.820 align:start position:0%
future speakers are going to have one
 
01:14:46.310 --> 01:14:46.320 align:start position:0%
heck of a time if they don't have some
 
01:14:49.669 --> 01:14:49.679 align:start position:0%
place to put the members and the staff
 
01:14:51.770 --> 01:14:51.780 align:start position:0%
thank you for that having needed one of
 
01:14:53.870 --> 01:14:53.880 align:start position:0%
those spaces after having surgery my
 
01:14:56.630 --> 01:14:56.640 align:start position:0%
first term I understand the challenges
 
01:14:57.890 --> 01:14:57.900 align:start position:0%
with it and I'm glad to know that
 
01:14:59.330 --> 01:14:59.340 align:start position:0%
that'll be addressed and our members
 
01:15:03.590 --> 01:15:03.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:06.709 --> 01:15:06.719 align:start position:0%
and this bill will now go to division
 
01:15:09.110 --> 01:15:09.120 align:start position:0%
one for further review
 
01:15:11.870 --> 01:15:11.880 align:start position:0%
they have and representative leishman
 
01:15:14.510 --> 01:15:14.520 align:start position:0%
has scheduled it for next Tuesday
 
01:15:16.370 --> 01:15:16.380 align:start position:0%
the 31st
 
01:15:18.169 --> 01:15:18.179 align:start position:0%
after it'll be the
 
01:15:19.390 --> 01:15:19.400 align:start position:0%
fifth bill
 
01:15:24.050 --> 01:15:24.060 align:start position:0%
that day at 1 30 House Bill 384 division
 
01:15:27.110 --> 01:15:27.120 align:start position:0%
one will be hearing further so
 
01:15:32.330 --> 01:15:32.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:34.790 --> 01:15:34.800 align:start position:0%
I will close the hearing for now on
 
01:15:37.270 --> 01:15:37.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:40.970 --> 01:15:40.980 align:start position:0%
384 and you have about a 10 minute break
 
01:15:51.709 --> 01:15:51.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:13.129 --> 01:31:13.139 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:06.189 --> 01:32:06.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:08.209 --> 01:32:08.219 align:start position:0%
good morning
 
01:32:10.550 --> 01:32:10.560 align:start position:0%
I will open the hearing on House Bill
 
01:32:10.560 --> 01:32:12.649 align:start position:0%
I will open the hearing on House Bill
506

01:32:12.649 --> 01:32:12.659 align:start position:0%
506
 
01:32:14.209 --> 01:32:14.219 align:start position:0%
call on one of the sponsors
 
01:32:24.830 --> 01:32:24.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:27.169 --> 01:32:27.179 align:start position:0%
good morning and thank you Mr chair and
 
01:32:29.450 --> 01:32:29.460 align:start position:0%
the members of the committee for
 
01:32:32.390 --> 01:32:32.400 align:start position:0%
enabling me to speak as a co-sponsor on
 
01:32:33.770 --> 01:32:33.780 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:32:36.770 --> 01:32:36.780 align:start position:0%
I am for the record
 
01:32:39.050 --> 01:32:39.060 align:start position:0%
Walter Stapleton Sullivan County
 
01:32:45.189 --> 01:32:45.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:48.350 --> 01:32:48.360 align:start position:0%
I am not
 
01:32:52.330 --> 01:32:52.340 align:start position:0%
intimately familiar with the site
 
01:32:55.970 --> 01:32:55.980 align:start position:0%
and many of the aspects of this so I'm
 
01:32:59.330 --> 01:32:59.340 align:start position:0%
going to talk in a general sense
 
01:33:03.229 --> 01:33:03.239 align:start position:0%
about this project and this bill
 
01:33:03.239 --> 01:33:05.450 align:start position:0%
about this project and this bill
historically

01:33:05.450 --> 01:33:05.460 align:start position:0%
historically
 
01:33:08.149 --> 01:33:08.159 align:start position:0%
Railroad and utility rights away are
 
01:33:10.550 --> 01:33:10.560 align:start position:0%
very expensive
 
01:33:13.129 --> 01:33:13.139 align:start position:0%
and a great deal of effort to Pure
 
01:33:13.139 --> 01:33:15.169 align:start position:0%
and a great deal of effort to Pure
procure

01:33:15.169 --> 01:33:15.179 align:start position:0%
procure
 
01:33:18.470 --> 01:33:18.480 align:start position:0%
and that was you know many years ago
 
01:33:21.530 --> 01:33:21.540 align:start position:0%
decades hundreds of years ago when it
 
01:33:25.070 --> 01:33:25.080 align:start position:0%
was easier now it's even more difficult
 
01:33:28.550 --> 01:33:28.560 align:start position:0%
and when we have these assets
 
01:33:33.110 --> 01:33:33.120 align:start position:0%
of rail utility rights of way even if
 
01:33:33.120 --> 01:33:34.450 align:start position:0%
of rail utility rights of way even if
they're

01:33:34.450 --> 01:33:34.460 align:start position:0%
they're
 
01:33:37.250 --> 01:33:37.260 align:start position:0%
discontinued from their original use as
 
01:33:38.930 --> 01:33:38.940 align:start position:0%
in rail trails
 
01:33:41.810 --> 01:33:41.820 align:start position:0%
these are still very viable important
 
01:33:41.820 --> 01:33:44.030 align:start position:0%
these are still very viable important
assets

01:33:44.030 --> 01:33:44.040 align:start position:0%
assets
 
01:33:48.709 --> 01:33:48.719 align:start position:0%
I happen to be a bicycler and a hiker
 
01:33:51.950 --> 01:33:51.960 align:start position:0%
and I've used with great satisfaction
 
01:33:55.850 --> 01:33:55.860 align:start position:0%
and fun many of the rail trails in this
 
01:33:58.790 --> 01:33:58.800 align:start position:0%
state and in other locations
 
01:34:02.689 --> 01:34:02.699 align:start position:0%
so one of the quality aspects of a
 
01:34:06.590 --> 01:34:06.600 align:start position:0%
recreational use of rail trails
 
01:34:10.330 --> 01:34:10.340 align:start position:0%
is an uninterrupted and non-conflicting
 
01:34:16.189 --> 01:34:16.199 align:start position:0%
aspect with other traffic and and usages
 
01:34:19.250 --> 01:34:19.260 align:start position:0%
so if when you truncate them
 
01:34:21.770 --> 01:34:21.780 align:start position:0%
you have dead spots
 
01:34:25.550 --> 01:34:25.560 align:start position:0%
shoe flies run arounds this is a
 
01:34:29.629 --> 01:34:29.639 align:start position:0%
detraction in the quality of the trail
 
01:34:32.090 --> 01:34:32.100 align:start position:0%
and oftentimes may represent a
 
01:34:35.330 --> 01:34:35.340 align:start position:0%
compromise of safety to the trail users
 
01:34:37.910 --> 01:34:37.920 align:start position:0%
as well as the other traffic modes and
 
01:34:37.920 --> 01:34:39.890 align:start position:0%
as well as the other traffic modes and
intersections

01:34:39.890 --> 01:34:39.900 align:start position:0%
intersections
 
01:34:42.470 --> 01:34:42.480 align:start position:0%
and if there are other
 
01:34:46.610 --> 01:34:46.620 align:start position:0%
um obstacles like Cliffs mountains
 
01:34:48.490 --> 01:34:48.500 align:start position:0%
Springs Brooks
 
01:34:52.129 --> 01:34:52.139 align:start position:0%
whatever that represent compromise of
 
01:34:54.110 --> 01:34:54.120 align:start position:0%
safety that's a further
 
01:34:57.229 --> 01:34:57.239 align:start position:0%
concern in that regard
 
01:35:00.110 --> 01:35:00.120 align:start position:0%
but beyond the use of the rail trail for
 
01:35:03.110 --> 01:35:03.120 align:start position:0%
recreational and personal use
 
01:35:05.870 --> 01:35:05.880 align:start position:0%
these are really important and viable
 
01:35:05.880 --> 01:35:07.250 align:start position:0%
these are really important and viable
assets

01:35:07.250 --> 01:35:07.260 align:start position:0%
assets
 
01:35:10.610 --> 01:35:10.620 align:start position:0%
to maintain the Integrity of Rights of
 
01:35:10.620 --> 01:35:11.990 align:start position:0%
to maintain the Integrity of Rights of
way

01:35:11.990 --> 01:35:12.000 align:start position:0%
way
 
01:35:14.270 --> 01:35:14.280 align:start position:0%
for utility
 
01:35:18.350 --> 01:35:18.360 align:start position:0%
pipe Gas Electric
 
01:35:18.360 --> 01:35:20.689 align:start position:0%
pipe Gas Electric
um

01:35:20.689 --> 01:35:20.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:20.699 --> 01:35:21.970 align:start position:0%
 
the

01:35:21.970 --> 01:35:21.980 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:35:25.330 --> 01:35:25.340 align:start position:0%
various components of
 
01:35:29.570 --> 01:35:29.580 align:start position:0%
cables that might be able to use and
 
01:35:33.010 --> 01:35:33.020 align:start position:0%
railroads have traditionally been
 
01:35:36.110 --> 01:35:36.120 align:start position:0%
extending rights of wave to both power
 
01:35:39.370 --> 01:35:39.380 align:start position:0%
overhead and
 
01:35:42.770 --> 01:35:42.780 align:start position:0%
infrared cables
 
01:35:45.430 --> 01:35:45.440 align:start position:0%
for communication
 
01:35:49.129 --> 01:35:49.139 align:start position:0%
purposes and this technology increases
 
01:35:53.350 --> 01:35:53.360 align:start position:0%
the need for these things very integral
 
01:35:57.290 --> 01:35:57.300 align:start position:0%
rights of way are important for
 
01:35:59.990 --> 01:36:00.000 align:start position:0%
that expanded use
 
01:36:03.590 --> 01:36:03.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:07.070 --> 01:36:07.080 align:start position:0%
enabling this box tunnel to be built
 
01:36:09.169 --> 01:36:09.179 align:start position:0%
continues the Integrity of the
 
01:36:12.470 --> 01:36:12.480 align:start position:0%
right-of-way for all of those purposes
 
01:36:15.590 --> 01:36:15.600 align:start position:0%
and I would even place the importance of
 
01:36:19.129 --> 01:36:19.139 align:start position:0%
those purposes on utility and
 
01:36:22.070 --> 01:36:22.080 align:start position:0%
right-of-way usage for important
 
01:36:22.080 --> 01:36:23.590 align:start position:0%
right-of-way usage for important
technological

01:36:23.590 --> 01:36:23.600 align:start position:0%
technological
 
01:36:27.530 --> 01:36:27.540 align:start position:0%
uses even as important or even above
 
01:36:29.870 --> 01:36:29.880 align:start position:0%
those of recreational
 
01:36:34.010 --> 01:36:34.020 align:start position:0%
so I stand in support of 506 and
 
01:36:37.370 --> 01:36:37.380 align:start position:0%
encourage the committee to pass on it
 
01:36:39.890 --> 01:36:39.900 align:start position:0%
and to maintain the Integrity of this
 
01:36:43.729 --> 01:36:43.739 align:start position:0%
important right-of-way asset
 
01:36:45.470 --> 01:36:45.480 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony questions
 
01:36:46.790 --> 01:36:46.800 align:start position:0%
from the committee representative
 
01:36:46.800 --> 01:36:48.950 align:start position:0%
from the committee representative
Griffin

01:36:48.950 --> 01:36:48.960 align:start position:0%
Griffin
 
01:36:52.010 --> 01:36:52.020 align:start position:0%
yes can you um thank you Mr Chad
 
01:36:55.189 --> 01:36:55.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:58.370 --> 01:36:58.380 align:start position:0%
could you tell the committee uh what the
 
01:37:00.530 --> 01:37:00.540 align:start position:0%
purpose is of the sentence that begins
 
01:37:02.149 --> 01:37:02.159 align:start position:0%
on line three
 
01:37:17.830 --> 01:37:17.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:20.090 --> 01:37:20.100 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question I just wanted
 
01:37:23.629 --> 01:37:23.639 align:start position:0%
to review what was said in there I did
 
01:37:26.750 --> 01:37:26.760 align:start position:0%
not write the legislation however
 
01:37:26.760 --> 01:37:28.010 align:start position:0%
not write the legislation however
um

01:37:28.010 --> 01:37:28.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:37:30.709 --> 01:37:30.719 align:start position:0%
projects of a very important nature and
 
01:37:32.930 --> 01:37:32.940 align:start position:0%
I believe that this isn't a category of
 
01:37:35.510 --> 01:37:35.520 align:start position:0%
that needs to have some protection
 
01:37:39.950 --> 01:37:39.960 align:start position:0%
against protesters or actors who might
 
01:37:43.610 --> 01:37:43.620 align:start position:0%
interrupt the construction and delay and
 
01:37:46.729 --> 01:37:46.739 align:start position:0%
therefore cost increase the cost of of
 
01:37:54.010 --> 01:37:54.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:56.030 --> 01:37:56.040 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee
 
01:37:59.390 --> 01:37:59.400 align:start position:0%
members representative Edwards uh thank
 
01:38:02.390 --> 01:38:02.400 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair I I have four points if if
 
01:38:04.910 --> 01:38:04.920 align:start position:0%
if you'd let me make them I'll come to
 
01:38:06.770 --> 01:38:06.780 align:start position:0%
you each time but
 
01:38:10.790 --> 01:38:10.800 align:start position:0%
um on line two uh the uh project is
 
01:38:14.030 --> 01:38:14.040 align:start position:0%
described as a rail trail box tunnel
 
01:38:19.790 --> 01:38:19.800 align:start position:0%
option on Interstate 93 exit 4A uh that
 
01:38:23.390 --> 01:38:23.400 align:start position:0%
I I perceived that to be too generic to
 
01:38:26.870 --> 01:38:26.880 align:start position:0%
really offer a lot of use to us I I I
 
01:38:29.689 --> 01:38:29.699 align:start position:0%
would what do you think about having
 
01:38:32.330 --> 01:38:32.340 align:start position:0%
that made more precise so we know what
 
01:38:35.030 --> 01:38:35.040 align:start position:0%
the intent is it's my understanding that
 
01:38:38.030 --> 01:38:38.040 align:start position:0%
there's a potentially multiple routes
 
01:38:40.729 --> 01:38:40.739 align:start position:0%
that could be selected and so I'd like
 
01:38:44.330 --> 01:38:44.340 align:start position:0%
to know what route is anticipated to use
 
01:38:46.729 --> 01:38:46.739 align:start position:0%
State funding we may have someone from
 
01:38:49.310 --> 01:38:49.320 align:start position:0%
the dot that will be able to answer that
 
01:38:51.709 --> 01:38:51.719 align:start position:0%
question I'll suspend I can go to point
 
01:38:54.470 --> 01:38:54.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:57.890 --> 01:38:57.900 align:start position:0%
um on line four
 
01:39:00.530 --> 01:39:00.540 align:start position:0%
the use of the word penalty is used at
 
01:39:03.050 --> 01:39:03.060 align:start position:0%
the end of that sentence and it says the
 
01:39:05.030 --> 01:39:05.040 align:start position:0%
penalty in this section shall include
 
01:39:08.330 --> 01:39:08.340 align:start position:0%
these people and I don't know who
 
01:39:10.189 --> 01:39:10.199 align:start position:0%
they're supposed to punish but I suspect
 
01:39:12.590 --> 01:39:12.600 align:start position:0%
there's a typo there
 
01:39:15.229 --> 01:39:15.239 align:start position:0%
the the penalty in this section shall
 
01:39:17.810 --> 01:39:17.820 align:start position:0%
include the project manager lead project
 
01:39:20.229 --> 01:39:20.239 align:start position:0%
engineer and the commissioner of the dot
 
01:39:22.970 --> 01:39:22.980 align:start position:0%
so so I think I think there's something
 
01:39:24.590 --> 01:39:24.600 align:start position:0%
wrong with that sense
 
01:39:27.169 --> 01:39:27.179 align:start position:0%
do you see it and how would that get
 
01:39:29.450 --> 01:39:29.460 align:start position:0%
fixed yes thank you for the question
 
01:39:32.930 --> 01:39:32.940 align:start position:0%
thank you for pointing out those details
 
01:39:35.510 --> 01:39:35.520 align:start position:0%
um I would preface my remarks by saying
 
01:39:37.850 --> 01:39:37.860 align:start position:0%
I wish I had had more opportunity and
 
01:39:40.370 --> 01:39:40.380 align:start position:0%
time to review and then make some
 
01:39:42.970 --> 01:39:42.980 align:start position:0%
recommendations on these sort of items
 
01:39:45.410 --> 01:39:45.420 align:start position:0%
uh yeah that's unclear and needs
 
01:39:47.570 --> 01:39:47.580 align:start position:0%
clarification the penalty it seems like
 
01:39:49.910 --> 01:39:49.920 align:start position:0%
there's missing words in there or a
 
01:39:53.530 --> 01:39:53.540 align:start position:0%
distracted thought thank you so much
 
01:39:57.050 --> 01:39:57.060 align:start position:0%
on the other question relative to the
 
01:40:01.310 --> 01:40:01.320 align:start position:0%
Interstate 93 exit 4A I agree that there
 
01:40:03.530 --> 01:40:03.540 align:start position:0%
should be some further references to
 
01:40:07.689 --> 01:40:07.699 align:start position:0%
local roads adjacent contingent to
 
01:40:11.090 --> 01:40:11.100 align:start position:0%
relative to what the um
 
01:40:13.910 --> 01:40:13.920 align:start position:0%
a shoe fly or the runaround would be as
 
01:40:16.129 --> 01:40:16.139 align:start position:0%
an alternative and if there are any
 
01:40:19.689 --> 01:40:19.699 align:start position:0%
other geographical conditions there like
 
01:40:22.430 --> 01:40:22.440 align:start position:0%
Brooks streams water courses whatever
 
01:40:26.149 --> 01:40:26.159 align:start position:0%
that that are a contingent or adjacent
 
01:40:28.870 --> 01:40:28.880 align:start position:0%
to these particular project area
 
01:40:32.750 --> 01:40:32.760 align:start position:0%
thank you sir so so I have two more
 
01:40:34.850 --> 01:40:34.860 align:start position:0%
um I I following along with what
 
01:40:37.430 --> 01:40:37.440 align:start position:0%
representative Griffin I think opened
 
01:40:40.430 --> 01:40:40.440 align:start position:0%
the door on is uh you know I would be
 
01:40:43.370 --> 01:40:43.380 align:start position:0%
opposed to adding to the criminal code
 
01:40:46.550 --> 01:40:46.560 align:start position:0%
in this funding bill I I don't I don't
 
01:40:48.110 --> 01:40:48.120 align:start position:0%
believe that's appropriate I believe
 
01:40:50.030 --> 01:40:50.040 align:start position:0%
that the
 
01:40:52.970 --> 01:40:52.980 align:start position:0%
um the the intent to allow construction
 
01:40:57.050 --> 01:40:57.060 align:start position:0%
to go forward is a good one do you do
 
01:40:59.689 --> 01:40:59.699 align:start position:0%
you think that there's already uh
 
01:41:03.229 --> 01:41:03.239 align:start position:0%
criminal code that would deliver the
 
01:41:05.030 --> 01:41:05.040 align:start position:0%
protection this project is wanting
 
01:41:06.530 --> 01:41:06.540 align:start position:0%
afforded to it
 
01:41:09.169 --> 01:41:09.179 align:start position:0%
thank you again for that question yes I
 
01:41:12.770 --> 01:41:12.780 align:start position:0%
agree that we have ample code in law and
 
01:41:16.970 --> 01:41:16.980 align:start position:0%
Alternatives in law to remedy or to
 
01:41:19.970 --> 01:41:19.980 align:start position:0%
discourage Interruption of this or any
 
01:41:22.129 --> 01:41:22.139 align:start position:0%
other project
 
01:41:24.189 --> 01:41:24.199 align:start position:0%
and then my final
 
01:41:27.290 --> 01:41:27.300 align:start position:0%
thank you for your forbearance sir
 
01:41:27.300 --> 01:41:28.010 align:start position:0%
thank you for your forbearance sir
um

01:41:28.010 --> 01:41:28.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:41:30.410 --> 01:41:30.420 align:start position:0%
you know given that given that this is
 
01:41:33.770 --> 01:41:33.780 align:start position:0%
trying to hire three new people and that
 
01:41:35.510 --> 01:41:35.520 align:start position:0%
the state is on the hooks for some of
 
01:41:38.629 --> 01:41:38.639 align:start position:0%
the money at least it it just strikes me
 
01:41:40.609 --> 01:41:40.619 align:start position:0%
that we may want to have a completion
 
01:41:43.609 --> 01:41:43.619 align:start position:0%
date or a Sunset date so that it's clear
 
01:41:46.729 --> 01:41:46.739 align:start position:0%
when the state is no longer entangled in
 
01:41:49.129 --> 01:41:49.139 align:start position:0%
this execution of this project what do
 
01:41:52.070 --> 01:41:52.080 align:start position:0%
you think about potential Sunset data or
 
01:41:55.790 --> 01:41:55.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:58.430 --> 01:41:58.440 align:start position:0%
I have not been able to
 
01:42:01.189 --> 01:42:01.199 align:start position:0%
take a look at prospective project
 
01:42:01.199 --> 01:42:04.790 align:start position:0%
take a look at prospective project
parameters

01:42:04.790 --> 01:42:04.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:07.669 --> 01:42:07.679 align:start position:0%
so you know the length of construction
 
01:42:07.679 --> 01:42:09.109 align:start position:0%
so you know the length of construction
is

01:42:09.109 --> 01:42:09.119 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:42:11.990 --> 01:42:12.000 align:start position:0%
could be determined by the extent of the
 
01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:13.370 align:start position:0%
could be determined by the extent of the
project

01:42:13.370 --> 01:42:13.380 align:start position:0%
project
 
01:42:17.030 --> 01:42:17.040 align:start position:0%
and I couldn't even give a guesstimate
 
01:42:19.970 --> 01:42:19.980 align:start position:0%
as to when a sunset or termination date
 
01:42:22.790 --> 01:42:22.800 align:start position:0%
might be appropriate
 
01:42:25.250 --> 01:42:25.260 align:start position:0%
um and and therefore maybe that is a
 
01:42:27.770 --> 01:42:27.780 align:start position:0%
further for Amendment
 
01:42:30.790 --> 01:42:30.800 align:start position:0%
um with regard to looking at the project
 
01:42:33.950 --> 01:42:33.960 align:start position:0%
parameters and details and then coming
 
01:42:38.030 --> 01:42:38.040 align:start position:0%
up with such a Sunset date yeah I and I
 
01:42:39.950 --> 01:42:39.960 align:start position:0%
am looking at the sponsor list I
 
01:42:41.810 --> 01:42:41.820 align:start position:0%
consider you all friends and smart
 
01:42:44.030 --> 01:42:44.040 align:start position:0%
people and these comments were intended
 
01:42:46.970 --> 01:42:46.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:49.250 --> 01:42:49.260 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry again please
 
01:42:51.950 --> 01:42:51.960 align:start position:0%
um I I was attempting to be helpful
 
01:42:53.870 --> 01:42:53.880 align:start position:0%
because I as I look at the sponsor list
 
01:42:56.750 --> 01:42:56.760 align:start position:0%
I I know all of you I respect all of you
 
01:42:58.850 --> 01:42:58.860 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm sure you're trying to do the
 
01:43:00.649 --> 01:43:00.659 align:start position:0%
right thing I just I'm just not sure
 
01:43:03.709 --> 01:43:03.719 align:start position:0%
this is the right it's it's not ready I
 
01:43:06.830 --> 01:43:06.840 align:start position:0%
don't think I understand uh I I signed
 
01:43:09.590 --> 01:43:09.600 align:start position:0%
on to this conceptually as I expressed
 
01:43:11.689 --> 01:43:11.699 align:start position:0%
in my introduction
 
01:43:13.970 --> 01:43:13.980 align:start position:0%
um and I'm sorry that I'm bereft of some
 
01:43:16.010 --> 01:43:16.020 align:start position:0%
of the important details to help this
 
01:43:20.270 --> 01:43:20.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:22.189 --> 01:43:22.199 align:start position:0%
any further questions from committee
 
01:43:22.199 --> 01:43:24.470 align:start position:0%
any further questions from committee
members

01:43:24.470 --> 01:43:24.480 align:start position:0%
members
 
01:43:26.270 --> 01:43:26.280 align:start position:0%
representative Mooney
 
01:43:28.850 --> 01:43:28.860 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you I
 
01:43:30.590 --> 01:43:30.600 align:start position:0%
can understand your passion for wanting
 
01:43:32.570 --> 01:43:32.580 align:start position:0%
to have this project and get it done
 
01:43:35.030 --> 01:43:35.040 align:start position:0%
timely but I'm having difficulty getting
 
01:43:38.270 --> 01:43:38.280 align:start position:0%
over lines three through four is it your
 
01:43:40.810 --> 01:43:40.820 align:start position:0%
intention to create an entirely new
 
01:43:44.290 --> 01:43:44.300 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor aimed at three specific
 
01:43:47.030 --> 01:43:47.040 align:start position:0%
individuals and if so is there any
 
01:43:50.450 --> 01:43:50.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:54.169 --> 01:43:54.179 align:start position:0%
yeah that's that's a little bit out and
 
01:43:56.510 --> 01:43:56.520 align:start position:0%
outer limits
 
01:43:58.490 --> 01:43:58.500 align:start position:0%
and again I
 
01:44:02.629 --> 01:44:02.639 align:start position:0%
I did not have the time or take the time
 
01:44:06.290 --> 01:44:06.300 align:start position:0%
to look at this closer and I'm sorry for
 
01:44:06.300 --> 01:44:07.070 align:start position:0%
to look at this closer and I'm sorry for
that

01:44:07.070 --> 01:44:07.080 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:44:07.080 --> 01:44:07.990 align:start position:0%
that
um

01:44:07.990 --> 01:44:08.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:44:10.870 --> 01:44:10.880 align:start position:0%
having heretofore been able to
 
01:44:13.310 --> 01:44:13.320 align:start position:0%
evaluate that I would have made some
 
01:44:15.310 --> 01:44:15.320 align:start position:0%
constructive recommendations
 
01:44:19.370 --> 01:44:19.380 align:start position:0%
and the penalty aspect doesn't doesn't
 
01:44:22.490 --> 01:44:22.500 align:start position:0%
seem to fit because we have code and law
 
01:44:26.149 --> 01:44:26.159 align:start position:0%
already for answering any problems with
 
01:44:30.290 --> 01:44:30.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:32.209 --> 01:44:32.219 align:start position:0%
any further questions from committee
 
01:44:32.219 --> 01:44:33.470 align:start position:0%
any further questions from committee
members

01:44:33.470 --> 01:44:33.480 align:start position:0%
members
 
01:44:35.149 --> 01:44:35.159 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you representative
 
01:44:41.450 --> 01:44:41.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:43.850 --> 01:44:43.860 align:start position:0%
I will next call on representative Peter
 
01:44:45.350 --> 01:44:45.360 align:start position:0%
stamness who's from the New Hampshire
 
01:44:48.590 --> 01:44:48.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:50.209 --> 01:44:50.219 align:start position:0%
you have other people you want to
 
01:44:56.290 --> 01:44:56.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:59.870 --> 01:44:59.880 align:start position:0%
push that make if it's red it's ready no
 
01:45:04.010 --> 01:45:04.020 align:start position:0%
sir okay I'll be the only one testifying
 
01:45:05.570 --> 01:45:05.580 align:start position:0%
Mr chair
 
01:45:06.950 --> 01:45:06.960 align:start position:0%
um members of the committee my name is
 
01:45:09.530 --> 01:45:09.540 align:start position:0%
Peter stamness the director of project
 
01:45:12.590 --> 01:45:12.600 align:start position:0%
development for the dot
 
01:45:12.600 --> 01:45:13.729 align:start position:0%
development for the dot
um

01:45:13.729 --> 01:45:13.739 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:45:15.530 --> 01:45:15.540 align:start position:0%
been with the dot
 
01:45:19.609 --> 01:45:19.619 align:start position:0%
um 36 years and prior to this position
 
01:45:23.149 --> 01:45:23.159 align:start position:0%
I spent 10 years as a project manager
 
01:45:26.090 --> 01:45:26.100 align:start position:0%
for I-93 sailing to Manchester which
 
01:45:31.310 --> 01:45:31.320 align:start position:0%
this um construction project exit 4A
 
01:45:31.320 --> 01:45:32.030 align:start position:0%
this um construction project exit 4A
um

01:45:32.030 --> 01:45:32.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:45:34.850 --> 01:45:34.860 align:start position:0%
is a new exit on I-93 so I'm
 
01:45:36.590 --> 01:45:36.600 align:start position:0%
pretty familiar with the with the
 
01:45:39.649 --> 01:45:39.659 align:start position:0%
history of the project and um have been
 
01:45:42.109 --> 01:45:42.119 align:start position:0%
involved in in a significant number of
 
01:45:44.090 --> 01:45:44.100 align:start position:0%
of meetings on the project and the
 
01:45:46.729 --> 01:45:46.739 align:start position:0%
details of this so
 
01:45:46.739 --> 01:45:47.510 align:start position:0%
details of this so
um

01:45:47.510 --> 01:45:47.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:45:51.890 --> 01:45:51.900 align:start position:0%
and uh dot opposes this bill
 
01:45:53.030 --> 01:45:53.040 align:start position:0%
um I'll give you a little bit of
 
01:45:55.669 --> 01:45:55.679 align:start position:0%
information on the proposed layout and
 
01:45:57.830 --> 01:45:57.840 align:start position:0%
there were some questions about the
 
01:46:00.770 --> 01:46:00.780 align:start position:0%
differences between the two layouts um
 
01:46:03.669 --> 01:46:03.679 align:start position:0%
the bill mentions a tunnel option
 
01:46:06.649 --> 01:46:06.659 align:start position:0%
the proposed option the preferred option
 
01:46:09.590 --> 01:46:09.600 align:start position:0%
by the dot and
 
01:46:12.890 --> 01:46:12.900 align:start position:0%
um townedary who supports it
 
01:46:12.900 --> 01:46:13.609 align:start position:0%
um townedary who supports it
um

01:46:13.609 --> 01:46:13.619 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:46:15.709 --> 01:46:15.719 align:start position:0%
is a
 
01:46:18.709 --> 01:46:18.719 align:start position:0%
is a a less direct route than the tunnel
 
01:46:21.189 --> 01:46:21.199 align:start position:0%
option it's we call it the scenic route
 
01:46:25.010 --> 01:46:25.020 align:start position:0%
and it was developed as a refinement and
 
01:46:27.229 --> 01:46:27.239 align:start position:0%
a cost-saving alternative to the
 
01:46:29.270 --> 01:46:29.280 align:start position:0%
original design which was
 
01:46:33.290 --> 01:46:33.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:37.490 --> 01:46:37.500 align:start position:0%
the uh this this proposal provides a
 
01:46:40.850 --> 01:46:40.860 align:start position:0%
safe grade separated Crossing that is
 
01:46:42.770 --> 01:46:42.780 align:start position:0%
ADA Compliant
 
01:46:45.350 --> 01:46:45.360 align:start position:0%
it improves and I mean grade separated
 
01:46:48.169 --> 01:46:48.179 align:start position:0%
meaning the trail goes under the road
 
01:46:52.129 --> 01:46:52.139 align:start position:0%
under Folsom Road similar to the tunnel
 
01:46:54.649 --> 01:46:54.659 align:start position:0%
option so there is no
 
01:46:54.659 --> 01:46:55.189 align:start position:0%
option so there is no
um

01:46:55.189 --> 01:46:55.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:46:58.490 --> 01:46:58.500 align:start position:0%
conflict between Trail users and
 
01:47:01.010 --> 01:47:01.020 align:start position:0%
vehicles on Folsom road so it goes under
 
01:47:05.750 --> 01:47:05.760 align:start position:0%
Folsom Road utilizing a a Bridge
 
01:47:08.090 --> 01:47:08.100 align:start position:0%
Crossing so this is a there's a bridge
 
01:47:10.310 --> 01:47:10.320 align:start position:0%
that crosses the river
 
01:47:13.310 --> 01:47:13.320 align:start position:0%
um Shields Brook and the uh this this
 
01:47:13.320 --> 01:47:15.530 align:start position:0%
um Shields Brook and the uh this this
alternative

01:47:15.530 --> 01:47:15.540 align:start position:0%
alternative
 
01:47:18.350 --> 01:47:18.360 align:start position:0%
um will take the trail under that bridge
 
01:47:20.990 --> 01:47:21.000 align:start position:0%
adjacent to the river and connect it to
 
01:47:22.550 --> 01:47:22.560 align:start position:0%
the rail trail on both ends the North
 
01:47:24.530 --> 01:47:24.540 align:start position:0%
and South End
 
01:47:27.590 --> 01:47:27.600 align:start position:0%
the proposed layout improves access and
 
01:47:29.570 --> 01:47:29.580 align:start position:0%
continuity to the sidewalks on Folsom
 
01:47:33.410 --> 01:47:33.420 align:start position:0%
Road this isn't just a rail trail it
 
01:47:33.420 --> 01:47:34.450 align:start position:0%
Road this isn't just a rail trail it
also

01:47:34.450 --> 01:47:34.460 align:start position:0%
also
 
01:47:37.430 --> 01:47:37.440 align:start position:0%
connects to the sidewalks on the north
 
01:47:39.590 --> 01:47:39.600 align:start position:0%
and south side of Folsom Road and
 
01:47:41.390 --> 01:47:41.400 align:start position:0%
there'll be connectivity to those
 
01:47:41.400 --> 01:47:43.250 align:start position:0%
there'll be connectivity to those
sidewalks

01:47:43.250 --> 01:47:43.260 align:start position:0%
sidewalks
 
01:47:46.189 --> 01:47:46.199 align:start position:0%
um which will be more direct for this
 
01:47:48.830 --> 01:47:48.840 align:start position:0%
proposed alternative the scenic route as
 
01:47:51.890 --> 01:47:51.900 align:start position:0%
opposed to the tunnel row
 
01:47:53.930 --> 01:47:53.940 align:start position:0%
um this alternative doesn't require a
 
01:47:56.330 --> 01:47:56.340 align:start position:0%
second structure so that's identified as
 
01:47:57.770 --> 01:47:57.780 align:start position:0%
a cost savings and that was one of the
 
01:48:01.129 --> 01:48:01.139 align:start position:0%
main driving elements of
 
01:48:02.510 --> 01:48:02.520 align:start position:0%
um us
 
01:48:02.520 --> 01:48:03.970 align:start position:0%
um us
um

01:48:03.970 --> 01:48:03.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:48:08.270 --> 01:48:08.280 align:start position:0%
utilizing or preferring this this option
 
01:48:10.430 --> 01:48:10.440 align:start position:0%
and eliminates a structure from a
 
01:48:12.830 --> 01:48:12.840 align:start position:0%
maintenance role so this will um this
 
01:48:15.410 --> 01:48:15.420 align:start position:0%
will be owned and maintained by the town
 
01:48:17.990 --> 01:48:18.000 align:start position:0%
of Derry and one more structure that
 
01:48:21.229 --> 01:48:21.239 align:start position:0%
that doesn't need to be maintained
 
01:48:23.570 --> 01:48:23.580 align:start position:0%
um it received public input at multiple
 
01:48:23.580 --> 01:48:24.770 align:start position:0%
um it received public input at multiple
meetings

01:48:24.770 --> 01:48:24.780 align:start position:0%
meetings
 
01:48:26.570 --> 01:48:26.580 align:start position:0%
and it's supported by the Derry Town
 
01:48:26.580 --> 01:48:27.830 align:start position:0%
and it's supported by the Derry Town
Council

01:48:27.830 --> 01:48:27.840 align:start position:0%
Council
 
01:48:30.950 --> 01:48:30.960 align:start position:0%
and um it's really a sensible balance of
 
01:48:33.770 --> 01:48:33.780 align:start position:0%
all stakeholder interest so
 
01:48:36.709 --> 01:48:36.719 align:start position:0%
um in my experience there have been very
 
01:48:39.590 --> 01:48:39.600 align:start position:0%
few projects who that have received 100
 
01:48:39.600 --> 01:48:42.709 align:start position:0%
few projects who that have received 100
support

01:48:42.709 --> 01:48:42.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:45.530 --> 01:48:45.540 align:start position:0%
um you know we try to balance all of
 
01:48:45.540 --> 01:48:46.669 align:start position:0%
um you know we try to balance all of
um

01:48:46.669 --> 01:48:46.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:48:49.370 --> 01:48:49.380 align:start position:0%
all of the concerns and it's and it's a
 
01:48:51.290 --> 01:48:51.300 align:start position:0%
difficult job to do that
 
01:48:54.590 --> 01:48:54.600 align:start position:0%
and we feel that this this solution does
 
01:48:54.600 --> 01:48:56.689 align:start position:0%
and we feel that this this solution does
that

01:48:56.689 --> 01:48:56.699 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:48:59.149 --> 01:48:59.159 align:start position:0%
um and and
 
01:49:01.220 --> 01:49:01.230 align:start position:0%
what this bill will do
 
01:49:01.230 --> 01:49:01.550 align:start position:0%
what this bill will do
[Music]

01:49:01.550 --> 01:49:01.560 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:49:01.560 --> 01:49:02.990 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

01:49:02.990 --> 01:49:03.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:49:05.149 --> 01:49:05.159 align:start position:0%
um if it requires a change in design so
 
01:49:07.370 --> 01:49:07.380 align:start position:0%
right now we are advancing the scenic
 
01:49:09.530 --> 01:49:09.540 align:start position:0%
route uh the one structure alternative
 
01:49:13.129 --> 01:49:13.139 align:start position:0%
and if we advance or change uh course
 
01:49:15.530 --> 01:49:15.540 align:start position:0%
and go with the tunnel option which is
 
01:49:17.229 --> 01:49:17.239 align:start position:0%
suggested in the bill
 
01:49:19.910 --> 01:49:19.920 align:start position:0%
it will cause additional delays to the
 
01:49:21.189 --> 01:49:21.199 align:start position:0%
construction schedule
 
01:49:25.669 --> 01:49:25.679 align:start position:0%
and so that's a reason for the
 
01:49:28.669 --> 01:49:28.679 align:start position:0%
opposition and I'll also note that I'm
 
01:49:30.290 --> 01:49:30.300 align:start position:0%
not one of the people who are mentioned
 
01:49:33.709 --> 01:49:33.719 align:start position:0%
in in the bill but I know that the other
 
01:49:36.649 --> 01:49:36.659 align:start position:0%
three who are and um you know the threat
 
01:49:44.689 --> 01:49:44.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:50.090 --> 01:49:50.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:52.490 --> 01:49:52.500 align:start position:0%
representative heward and representative
 
01:49:52.500 --> 01:49:53.510 align:start position:0%
representative heward and representative
McGuire

01:49:53.510 --> 01:49:53.520 align:start position:0%
McGuire
 
01:49:55.850 --> 01:49:55.860 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:49:59.149 --> 01:49:59.159 align:start position:0%
from Reading from reading this bill I I
 
01:50:01.970 --> 01:50:01.980 align:start position:0%
take it it's been decided that what is
 
01:50:04.550 --> 01:50:04.560 align:start position:0%
going to be built uh
 
01:50:08.930 --> 01:50:08.940 align:start position:0%
is a rail trail box tunnel and not
 
01:50:12.530 --> 01:50:12.540 align:start position:0%
nothing else no no sir no
 
01:50:14.990 --> 01:50:15.000 align:start position:0%
that's what the bill would would prefer
 
01:50:18.109 --> 01:50:18.119 align:start position:0%
us to construct
 
01:50:18.119 --> 01:50:19.669 align:start position:0%
us to construct
well

01:50:19.669 --> 01:50:19.679 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:50:22.510 --> 01:50:22.520 align:start position:0%
if you
 
01:50:26.410 --> 01:50:26.420 align:start position:0%
name me one additional
 
01:50:28.850 --> 01:50:28.860 align:start position:0%
choice that you have as far as this
 
01:50:28.860 --> 01:50:30.109 align:start position:0%
choice that you have as far as this
project

01:50:30.109 --> 01:50:30.119 align:start position:0%
project
 
01:50:32.750 --> 01:50:32.760 align:start position:0%
other than a rail a rail trail box
 
01:50:35.209 --> 01:50:35.219 align:start position:0%
tunnel what else could you do
 
01:50:37.750 --> 01:50:37.760 align:start position:0%
um the preferred alternative
 
01:50:40.570 --> 01:50:40.580 align:start position:0%
takes the rail trail
 
01:50:42.649 --> 01:50:42.659 align:start position:0%
and it
 
01:50:47.270 --> 01:50:47.280 align:start position:0%
um passes it through and under a a
 
01:50:49.850 --> 01:50:49.860 align:start position:0%
proposed Bridge
 
01:50:52.609 --> 01:50:52.619 align:start position:0%
um that right now there's a probably a
 
01:50:54.169 --> 01:50:54.179 align:start position:0%
five foot diameter
 
01:50:57.169 --> 01:50:57.179 align:start position:0%
um Culvert that that takes five or six
 
01:50:59.030 --> 01:50:59.040 align:start position:0%
foot diameter Culvert that takes Shields
 
01:50:59.040 --> 01:51:00.050 align:start position:0%
foot diameter Culvert that takes Shields
Brook

01:51:00.050 --> 01:51:00.060 align:start position:0%
Brook
 
01:51:02.270 --> 01:51:02.280 align:start position:0%
um under Folsom Road we're putting a 90
 
01:51:04.790 --> 01:51:04.800 align:start position:0%
foot long bridge there and the rail
 
01:51:08.270 --> 01:51:08.280 align:start position:0%
trail will go under that bridge and
 
01:51:11.510 --> 01:51:11.520 align:start position:0%
connect to the south end of the rail
 
01:51:13.250 --> 01:51:13.260 align:start position:0%
trail and the North End of the rail
 
01:51:15.050 --> 01:51:15.060 align:start position:0%
trail on the opposite side of Folsom
 
01:51:15.060 --> 01:51:15.950 align:start position:0%
trail on the opposite side of Folsom
Road

01:51:15.950 --> 01:51:15.960 align:start position:0%
Road
 
01:51:19.129 --> 01:51:19.139 align:start position:0%
a follow-up follow-up
 
01:51:19.139 --> 01:51:19.910 align:start position:0%
a follow-up follow-up
um

01:51:19.910 --> 01:51:19.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:51:19.920 --> 01:51:21.590 align:start position:0%
um
so

01:51:21.590 --> 01:51:21.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:51:23.390 --> 01:51:23.400 align:start position:0%
even it would go underneath the bridge
 
01:51:25.910 --> 01:51:25.920 align:start position:0%
but it wouldn't be called there wouldn't
 
01:51:29.209 --> 01:51:29.219 align:start position:0%
be a box tunnel there right no okay we'd
 
01:51:31.550 --> 01:51:31.560 align:start position:0%
utilize the exist the proposed structure
 
01:51:34.010 --> 01:51:34.020 align:start position:0%
that's going to be used to carry
 
01:51:36.770 --> 01:51:36.780 align:start position:0%
Vehicles over
 
01:51:38.689 --> 01:51:38.699 align:start position:0%
um shieldsburg
 
01:51:42.290 --> 01:51:42.300 align:start position:0%
okay so the so the
 
01:51:42.300 --> 01:51:43.310 align:start position:0%
okay so the so the
um

01:51:43.310 --> 01:51:43.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:51:43.320 --> 01:51:45.370 align:start position:0%
um
penalties

01:51:45.370 --> 01:51:45.380 align:start position:0%
penalties
 
01:51:48.550 --> 01:51:48.560 align:start position:0%
imposed is for
 
01:51:52.370 --> 01:51:52.380 align:start position:0%
impeding a a box Tunnel construction so
 
01:51:53.689 --> 01:51:53.699 align:start position:0%
if you've did something else this
 
01:51:55.189 --> 01:51:55.199 align:start position:0%
wouldn't apply right
 
01:51:58.790 --> 01:51:58.800 align:start position:0%
uh that I the way I read it is if we
 
01:52:00.770 --> 01:52:00.780 align:start position:0%
don't do a box Culvert then
 
01:52:03.470 --> 01:52:03.480 align:start position:0%
um then there's penalties
 
01:52:05.090 --> 01:52:05.100 align:start position:0%
that's the way I read it but I could be
 
01:52:05.100 --> 01:52:05.750 align:start position:0%
that's the way I read it but I could be
wrong

01:52:05.750 --> 01:52:05.760 align:start position:0%
wrong
 
01:52:08.930 --> 01:52:08.940 align:start position:0%
okay one could even read it to say that
 
01:52:14.570 --> 01:52:14.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:18.290 --> 01:52:18.300 align:start position:0%
we have a penalty thank you Mr chairman
 
01:52:20.510 --> 01:52:20.520 align:start position:0%
especially that's up to the judge but I
 
01:52:20.520 --> 01:52:21.649 align:start position:0%
especially that's up to the judge but I
think

01:52:21.649 --> 01:52:21.659 align:start position:0%
think
 
01:52:24.770 --> 01:52:24.780 align:start position:0%
that in a wider sense of reading it any
 
01:52:24.780 --> 01:52:26.570 align:start position:0%
that in a wider sense of reading it any
person

01:52:26.570 --> 01:52:26.580 align:start position:0%
person
 
01:52:28.850 --> 01:52:28.860 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire for a question
 
01:52:30.590 --> 01:52:30.600 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
01:52:32.570 --> 01:52:32.580 align:start position:0%
taking my question I had a hard time
 
01:52:34.729 --> 01:52:34.739 align:start position:0%
following your your testimony because
 
01:52:38.750 --> 01:52:38.760 align:start position:0%
I'm not familiar with this exit Etc do
 
01:52:40.550 --> 01:52:40.560 align:start position:0%
you already have or maybe you could
 
01:52:43.850 --> 01:52:43.860 align:start position:0%
create a side-by-side document that that
 
01:52:47.629 --> 01:52:47.639 align:start position:0%
says the rail trail box tunnel option
 
01:52:51.109 --> 01:52:51.119 align:start position:0%
versus the scenic route option and
 
01:52:53.930 --> 01:52:53.940 align:start position:0%
different features of each or maybe
 
01:52:56.629 --> 01:52:56.639 align:start position:0%
drawing of each or you know cost of each
 
01:52:58.430 --> 01:52:58.440 align:start position:0%
and that sort of thing a kind of a side
 
01:52:59.990 --> 01:53:00.000 align:start position:0%
by side
 
01:53:02.570 --> 01:53:02.580 align:start position:0%
um we we've got lots of uh documentation
 
01:53:04.970 --> 01:53:04.980 align:start position:0%
on the various Alternatives and I I
 
01:53:08.030 --> 01:53:08.040 align:start position:0%
could uh I could provide that to you
 
01:53:10.910 --> 01:53:10.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:12.770 --> 01:53:12.780 align:start position:0%
representative tolerski for a question
 
01:53:14.870 --> 01:53:14.880 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
01:53:17.090 --> 01:53:17.100 align:start position:0%
um so if I understand this correctly
 
01:53:19.550 --> 01:53:19.560 align:start position:0%
this project is already in process with
 
01:53:20.930 --> 01:53:20.940 align:start position:0%
the Department of Transportation with
 
01:53:23.229 --> 01:53:23.239 align:start position:0%
the approval of the town of Derry
 
01:53:26.510 --> 01:53:26.520 align:start position:0%
everyone's on board and uh the funds are
 
01:53:28.490 --> 01:53:28.500 align:start position:0%
there ready to go as far as I can tell
 
01:53:29.990 --> 01:53:30.000 align:start position:0%
what the fiscal note scheduled for this
 
01:53:30.000 --> 01:53:32.149 align:start position:0%
what the fiscal note scheduled for this
summer

01:53:32.149 --> 01:53:32.159 align:start position:0%
summer
 
01:53:34.910 --> 01:53:34.920 align:start position:0%
knowing I don't want you to try to
 
01:53:38.090 --> 01:53:38.100 align:start position:0%
project what was in the minds of the
 
01:53:39.890 --> 01:53:39.900 align:start position:0%
people who drafted this bill but in your
 
01:53:41.570 --> 01:53:41.580 align:start position:0%
interactions with the development of
 
01:53:43.490 --> 01:53:43.500 align:start position:0%
this project with the town of Derry can
 
01:53:45.169 --> 01:53:45.179 align:start position:0%
you Enlighten us a little bit on what
 
01:53:47.510 --> 01:53:47.520 align:start position:0%
the opposition might be to the existing
 
01:53:49.189 --> 01:53:49.199 align:start position:0%
project that's already been approved and
 
01:53:53.330 --> 01:53:53.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:53.340 --> 01:53:57.470 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:53:57.470 --> 01:53:57.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:59.990 --> 01:54:00.000 align:start position:0%
I think they wanted to the uh the
 
01:54:02.750 --> 01:54:02.760 align:start position:0%
advocates for the tunnel option want the
 
01:54:05.930 --> 01:54:05.940 align:start position:0%
direct route the straight shot
 
01:54:05.940 --> 01:54:06.709 align:start position:0%
direct route the straight shot
um

01:54:06.709 --> 01:54:06.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:54:10.310 --> 01:54:10.320 align:start position:0%
through the box Culvert under the road
 
01:54:11.750 --> 01:54:11.760 align:start position:0%
um the
 
01:54:11.760 --> 01:54:12.470 align:start position:0%
um the
um

01:54:12.470 --> 01:54:12.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:54:17.149 --> 01:54:17.159 align:start position:0%
alternative that is being proposed is
 
01:54:17.159 --> 01:54:17.870 align:start position:0%
alternative that is being proposed is
um

01:54:17.870 --> 01:54:17.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:54:19.669 --> 01:54:19.679 align:start position:0%
around a thousand feet longer from a
 
01:54:21.430 --> 01:54:21.440 align:start position:0%
trail standpoint because
 
01:54:25.189 --> 01:54:25.199 align:start position:0%
there's grades that need to be
 
01:54:25.199 --> 01:54:26.510 align:start position:0%
there's grades that need to be
um

01:54:26.510 --> 01:54:26.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:54:26.520 --> 01:54:27.830 align:start position:0%
um
um

01:54:27.830 --> 01:54:27.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:54:30.050 --> 01:54:30.060 align:start position:0%
accounted for and so there's some
 
01:54:33.770 --> 01:54:33.780 align:start position:0%
curvature to the trail and
 
01:54:35.390 --> 01:54:35.400 align:start position:0%
um so the the
 
01:54:38.270 --> 01:54:38.280 align:start position:0%
point A to point B is about a thousand
 
01:54:40.070 --> 01:54:40.080 align:start position:0%
feet longer
 
01:54:44.330 --> 01:54:44.340 align:start position:0%
in in the state's proposal than the
 
01:54:46.390 --> 01:54:46.400 align:start position:0%
trail Advocates
 
01:54:49.129 --> 01:54:49.139 align:start position:0%
proposal and
 
01:54:49.139 --> 01:54:51.290 align:start position:0%
proposal and
um

01:54:51.290 --> 01:54:51.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:55.910 --> 01:54:55.920 align:start position:0%
I believe and and glean this from
 
01:54:58.430 --> 01:54:58.440 align:start position:0%
multiple conversations and meetings that
 
01:55:01.370 --> 01:55:01.380 align:start position:0%
they prefer the the direct route because
 
01:55:04.370 --> 01:55:04.380 align:start position:0%
they feel that it's more of a it could
 
01:55:06.290 --> 01:55:06.300 align:start position:0%
be used as a commuting route and that
 
01:55:07.550 --> 01:55:07.560 align:start position:0%
they feel
 
01:55:07.560 --> 01:55:08.390 align:start position:0%
they feel
um

01:55:08.390 --> 01:55:08.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:55:12.770 --> 01:55:12.780 align:start position:0%
that that a direct route is is safer
 
01:55:12.780 --> 01:55:14.450 align:start position:0%
that that a direct route is is safer
follow-up

01:55:14.450 --> 01:55:14.460 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
01:55:16.129 --> 01:55:16.139 align:start position:0%
follow-up would I be correct though and
 
01:55:18.649 --> 01:55:18.659 align:start position:0%
what I stated also that this project is
 
01:55:21.530 --> 01:55:21.540 align:start position:0%
planned approved budgeted for and on
 
01:55:25.550 --> 01:55:25.560 align:start position:0%
track to happen anyway this summer
 
01:55:27.050 --> 01:55:27.060 align:start position:0%
um it's already under construction so
 
01:55:30.050 --> 01:55:30.060 align:start position:0%
there's three there's three uh contracts
 
01:55:32.990 --> 01:55:33.000 align:start position:0%
um included in this Corridor project one
 
01:55:35.109 --> 01:55:35.119 align:start position:0%
is already under construction
 
01:55:39.470 --> 01:55:39.480 align:start position:0%
this element uh this this this portion
 
01:55:41.450 --> 01:55:41.460 align:start position:0%
of the of the corridor
 
01:55:45.189 --> 01:55:45.199 align:start position:0%
um is under design it has been on hold
 
01:55:50.780 --> 01:55:50.790 align:start position:0%
while we navigate the challenges around
 
01:55:50.790 --> 01:55:51.950 align:start position:0%
while we navigate the challenges around
[Music]

01:55:51.950 --> 01:55:51.960 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:55:54.169 --> 01:55:54.179 align:start position:0%
you know the the the the the the the
 
01:55:56.810 --> 01:55:56.820 align:start position:0%
approach and the in the location of this
 
01:55:58.930 --> 01:55:58.940 align:start position:0%
rail trail so we put our pencils down
 
01:56:02.930 --> 01:56:02.940 align:start position:0%
and we waited until we got the support
 
01:56:05.030 --> 01:56:05.040 align:start position:0%
that we needed and we had additional
 
01:56:08.330 --> 01:56:08.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:08.340 --> 01:56:09.109 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:56:09.109 --> 01:56:09.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:56:12.830 --> 01:56:12.840 align:start position:0%
we do we
 
01:56:15.109 --> 01:56:15.119 align:start position:0%
we have one more
 
01:56:18.109 --> 01:56:18.119 align:start position:0%
um element from a from a cultural
 
01:56:19.609 --> 01:56:19.619 align:start position:0%
resource standpoint that we need to
 
01:56:19.619 --> 01:56:20.990 align:start position:0%
resource standpoint that we need to
finalize

01:56:20.990 --> 01:56:21.000 align:start position:0%
finalize
 
01:56:23.990 --> 01:56:24.000 align:start position:0%
um and we've we've got basic agreement
 
01:56:27.590 --> 01:56:27.600 align:start position:0%
for from all the stakeholders resources
 
01:56:29.090 --> 01:56:29.100 align:start position:0%
we just need to get a final approval
 
01:56:31.609 --> 01:56:31.619 align:start position:0%
from the Federal Highway
 
01:56:34.910 --> 01:56:34.920 align:start position:0%
um on on the The Adjustment that we made
 
01:56:37.870 --> 01:56:37.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:37.880 --> 01:56:39.530 align:start position:0%
 
and

01:56:39.530 --> 01:56:39.540 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:56:41.870 --> 01:56:41.880 align:start position:0%
um follow-up following up on this you
 
01:56:44.209 --> 01:56:44.219 align:start position:0%
know the delays um that we've that we
 
01:56:45.770 --> 01:56:45.780 align:start position:0%
have had
 
01:56:49.070 --> 01:56:49.080 align:start position:0%
um right now we uh plan to move into
 
01:56:53.770 --> 01:56:53.780 align:start position:0%
construction on the second phase in 2024
 
01:56:56.750 --> 01:56:56.760 align:start position:0%
and the third phase of the Year
 
01:56:59.030 --> 01:56:59.040 align:start position:0%
following that 2025 with a full
 
01:57:01.790 --> 01:57:01.800 align:start position:0%
completion date of 2028 for the corridor
 
01:57:03.649 --> 01:57:03.659 align:start position:0%
that's where our timetable is right now
 
01:57:06.890 --> 01:57:06.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:09.169 --> 01:57:09.179 align:start position:0%
representative papovichi Muller for a
 
01:57:11.689 --> 01:57:11.699 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair actually I
 
01:57:13.609 --> 01:57:13.619 align:start position:0%
have a few but I will ask for permission
 
01:57:14.870 --> 01:57:14.880 align:start position:0%
every time
 
01:57:17.450 --> 01:57:17.460 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking the questions
 
01:57:19.490 --> 01:57:19.500 align:start position:0%
um let me preface this by saying that
 
01:57:21.709 --> 01:57:21.719 align:start position:0%
I'm from Windham which is a community
 
01:57:25.310 --> 01:57:25.320 align:start position:0%
that's near you know the location and uh
 
01:57:27.950 --> 01:57:27.960 align:start position:0%
quite a few of our residents do use or
 
01:57:29.930 --> 01:57:29.940 align:start position:0%
plan to use that part of the rail trail
 
01:57:32.570 --> 01:57:32.580 align:start position:0%
I should also say that I'm not a real
 
01:57:35.030 --> 01:57:35.040 align:start position:0%
Trail user myself but you know I do hear
 
01:57:36.950 --> 01:57:36.960 align:start position:0%
a lot about it from the people in my
 
01:57:39.169 --> 01:57:39.179 align:start position:0%
community could you clarify to start
 
01:57:41.330 --> 01:57:41.340 align:start position:0%
with how much of the change between you
 
01:57:42.890 --> 01:57:42.900 align:start position:0%
know the original plan which was the
 
01:57:45.350 --> 01:57:45.360 align:start position:0%
tunnel to the current one which you know
 
01:57:47.689 --> 01:57:47.699 align:start position:0%
we can call it the current one was
 
01:57:49.729 --> 01:57:49.739 align:start position:0%
driven by cost and how much by safety
 
01:57:51.470 --> 01:57:51.480 align:start position:0%
I've heard news reports I've seen news
 
01:57:53.390 --> 01:57:53.400 align:start position:0%
reports that oh it's really about safety
 
01:57:54.830 --> 01:57:54.840 align:start position:0%
that it's really about cost I would
 
01:57:56.810 --> 01:57:56.820 align:start position:0%
appreciate a understanding of how much
 
01:58:00.120 --> 01:58:00.130 align:start position:0%
each of those was a part of the decision
 
01:58:00.130 --> 01:58:00.410 align:start position:0%
each of those was a part of the decision
[Music]

01:58:00.410 --> 01:58:00.420 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:58:00.420 --> 01:58:04.070 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

01:58:04.070 --> 01:58:04.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:06.229 --> 01:58:06.239 align:start position:0%
it was mostly
 
01:58:08.750 --> 01:58:08.760 align:start position:0%
um about the cost savings we were
 
01:58:11.570 --> 01:58:11.580 align:start position:0%
looking for ways to bring the cost of
 
01:58:13.970 --> 01:58:13.980 align:start position:0%
the project down and given the times
 
01:58:16.070 --> 01:58:16.080 align:start position:0%
that we're in it you know their their
 
01:58:18.530 --> 01:58:18.540 align:start position:0%
escalation going on that continues to
 
01:58:18.540 --> 01:58:19.729 align:start position:0%
escalation going on that continues to
move

01:58:19.729 --> 01:58:19.739 align:start position:0%
move
 
01:58:21.410 --> 01:58:21.420 align:start position:0%
um but we
 
01:58:21.420 --> 01:58:23.209 align:start position:0%
um but we
um have

01:58:23.209 --> 01:58:23.219 align:start position:0%
um have
 
01:58:28.070 --> 01:58:28.080 align:start position:0%
um engineered a safe solution it's ADA
 
01:58:28.080 --> 01:58:30.109 align:start position:0%
um engineered a safe solution it's ADA
Compliant

01:58:30.109 --> 01:58:30.119 align:start position:0%
Compliant
 
01:58:30.119 --> 01:58:30.790 align:start position:0%
Compliant
um

01:58:30.790 --> 01:58:30.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:58:30.800 --> 01:58:32.649 align:start position:0%
um
and

01:58:32.649 --> 01:58:32.659 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:58:37.430 --> 01:58:37.440 align:start position:0%
some would suggest and and I'm I'm I I'm
 
01:58:39.770 --> 01:58:39.780 align:start position:0%
a Believer in this I've also used the
 
01:58:41.209 --> 01:58:41.219 align:start position:0%
rail Trails
 
01:58:43.430 --> 01:58:43.440 align:start position:0%
um with my family
 
01:58:45.830 --> 01:58:45.840 align:start position:0%
um and I when we're when you're walking
 
01:58:47.689 --> 01:58:47.699 align:start position:0%
on the rail trails and it and you're
 
01:58:51.050 --> 01:58:51.060 align:start position:0%
shared with with bikers um you need to
 
01:58:53.149 --> 01:58:53.159 align:start position:0%
pay attention to where you're walking
 
01:58:55.970 --> 01:58:55.980 align:start position:0%
and if someone Strays you know you it
 
01:58:58.310 --> 01:58:58.320 align:start position:0%
you know because the bikers they go and
 
01:59:01.070 --> 01:59:01.080 align:start position:0%
and they're welcome to do that
 
01:59:02.930 --> 01:59:02.940 align:start position:0%
um you know we've introduced some some
 
01:59:06.290 --> 01:59:06.300 align:start position:0%
curvature to the trail that will slow
 
01:59:08.510 --> 01:59:08.520 align:start position:0%
you know bring the the you know the
 
01:59:09.830 --> 01:59:09.840 align:start position:0%
speeds closer together with the
 
01:59:11.629 --> 01:59:11.639 align:start position:0%
different users
 
01:59:13.250 --> 01:59:13.260 align:start position:0%
um and we have grades that are
 
01:59:15.290 --> 01:59:15.300 align:start position:0%
appropriate for
 
01:59:17.990 --> 01:59:18.000 align:start position:0%
um Ada to make them ADA Compliant and
 
01:59:20.149 --> 01:59:20.159 align:start position:0%
we've widened the trail in areas where
 
01:59:24.350 --> 01:59:24.360 align:start position:0%
there is curvature to improve safety and
 
01:59:24.360 --> 01:59:25.370 align:start position:0%
there is curvature to improve safety and
so

01:59:25.370 --> 01:59:25.380 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:59:27.890 --> 01:59:27.900 align:start position:0%
um I I believe I believe that we've got
 
01:59:30.709 --> 01:59:30.719 align:start position:0%
a safe solution and um it's at a cost
 
01:59:30.719 --> 01:59:31.850 align:start position:0%
a safe solution and um it's at a cost
savings

01:59:31.850 --> 01:59:31.860 align:start position:0%
savings
 
01:59:34.370 --> 01:59:34.380 align:start position:0%
um to State of New Hampshire thank you
 
01:59:38.209 --> 01:59:38.219 align:start position:0%
may I so the um
 
01:59:40.850 --> 01:59:40.860 align:start position:0%
I've heard a lot from a lot of residents
 
01:59:43.010 --> 01:59:43.020 align:start position:0%
about how this makes the rail trail
 
01:59:45.589 --> 01:59:45.599 align:start position:0%
harder to use and you know just less
 
01:59:47.149 --> 01:59:47.159 align:start position:0%
enjoyable and
 
01:59:49.729 --> 01:59:49.739 align:start position:0%
you know this is a permanent project
 
01:59:51.350 --> 01:59:51.360 align:start position:0%
right it's not like we are going to
 
01:59:53.330 --> 01:59:53.340 align:start position:0%
redesign this so we are talking about a
 
01:59:55.850 --> 01:59:55.860 align:start position:0%
one-time expense that needs to be
 
01:59:57.770 --> 01:59:57.780 align:start position:0%
carefully considered against usability
 
01:59:59.689 --> 01:59:59.699 align:start position:0%
concerns that will extend for many
 
02:00:02.990 --> 02:00:03.000 align:start position:0%
decades going forward have you have has
 
02:00:05.089 --> 02:00:05.099 align:start position:0%
the department considered that you know
 
02:00:07.430 --> 02:00:07.440 align:start position:0%
drop in usability for the trail is part
 
02:00:10.310 --> 02:00:10.320 align:start position:0%
of the balancing the costs versus the
 
02:00:12.350 --> 02:00:12.360 align:start position:0%
return you know
 
02:00:15.470 --> 02:00:15.480 align:start position:0%
again I think I think
 
02:00:17.930 --> 02:00:17.940 align:start position:0%
it's pretty subjective
 
02:00:21.290 --> 02:00:21.300 align:start position:0%
um some might think that the the more
 
02:00:23.330 --> 02:00:23.340 align:start position:0%
curvilinear Trail the scenic route
 
02:00:26.890 --> 02:00:26.900 align:start position:0%
taking it down by the uh
 
02:00:28.850 --> 02:00:28.860 align:start position:0%
Shields Brook
 
02:00:33.410 --> 02:00:33.420 align:start position:0%
um wide open Airy Crossing is going to
 
02:00:36.050 --> 02:00:36.060 align:start position:0%
be more enjoyable than a straight shot
 
02:00:38.530 --> 02:00:38.540 align:start position:0%
Trail through a long
 
02:00:41.930 --> 02:00:41.940 align:start position:0%
tight box Culvert
 
02:00:41.940 --> 02:00:42.890 align:start position:0%
tight box Culvert
um

02:00:42.890 --> 02:00:42.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:00:45.890 --> 02:00:45.900 align:start position:0%
you know it that we we ran into
 
02:00:48.070 --> 02:00:48.080 align:start position:0%
um as we advance the design we found
 
02:00:51.410 --> 02:00:51.420 align:start position:0%
that uh there was a shallow ledge and
 
02:00:53.629 --> 02:00:53.639 align:start position:0%
groundwater issues that complicate the
 
02:00:55.729 --> 02:00:55.739 align:start position:0%
overall design and construction and also
 
02:00:58.250 --> 02:00:58.260 align:start position:0%
the long-term uh maintenance
 
02:01:00.770 --> 02:01:00.780 align:start position:0%
responsibilities for the structure it's
 
02:01:02.629 --> 02:01:02.639 align:start position:0%
going to need to be lit it's the the
 
02:01:05.390 --> 02:01:05.400 align:start position:0%
lighting in the tunnel is going to need
 
02:01:07.310 --> 02:01:07.320 align:start position:0%
to be maintained
 
02:01:09.890 --> 02:01:09.900 align:start position:0%
um there are many people who would
 
02:01:11.570 --> 02:01:11.580 align:start position:0%
choose not to go through a tunnel like
 
02:01:13.850 --> 02:01:13.860 align:start position:0%
that because they feel it's unsafe so
 
02:01:15.770 --> 02:01:15.780 align:start position:0%
it's it's you know it's dependent on on
 
02:01:17.209 --> 02:01:17.219 align:start position:0%
your perspective I think it's very
 
02:01:17.219 --> 02:01:19.129 align:start position:0%
your perspective I think it's very
subjective

02:01:19.129 --> 02:01:19.139 align:start position:0%
subjective
 
02:01:22.070 --> 02:01:22.080 align:start position:0%
um and how you feel about that
 
02:01:23.510 --> 02:01:23.520 align:start position:0%
particular Crossing
 
02:01:25.189 --> 02:01:25.199 align:start position:0%
one more follow-up
 
02:01:27.890 --> 02:01:27.900 align:start position:0%
thank you you stated earlier that you
 
02:01:29.510 --> 02:01:29.520 align:start position:0%
have basic agreement from all the
 
02:01:31.310 --> 02:01:31.320 align:start position:0%
stakeholders does that include the local
 
02:01:33.649 --> 02:01:33.659 align:start position:0%
rail trail alliances are they considered
 
02:01:35.810 --> 02:01:35.820 align:start position:0%
still hurt stakeholders and have they
 
02:01:39.050 --> 02:01:39.060 align:start position:0%
agreed to the new design
 
02:01:41.510 --> 02:01:41.520 align:start position:0%
um early on when
 
02:01:46.669 --> 02:01:46.679 align:start position:0%
um this this alternative was conceived
 
02:01:48.589 --> 02:01:48.599 align:start position:0%
we did get
 
02:01:51.050 --> 02:01:51.060 align:start position:0%
a letter of support
 
02:01:54.649 --> 02:01:54.659 align:start position:0%
from the rail trail group
 
02:01:58.010 --> 02:01:58.020 align:start position:0%
and we took that at at face value they
 
02:02:01.490 --> 02:02:01.500 align:start position:0%
do not support the option that um
 
02:02:03.229 --> 02:02:03.239 align:start position:0%
that we are proposing
 
02:02:04.970 --> 02:02:04.980 align:start position:0%
thank you and one question for you Mr
 
02:02:06.649 --> 02:02:06.659 align:start position:0%
chair if I could
 
02:02:09.169 --> 02:02:09.179 align:start position:0%
um and for the record that rail trail
 
02:02:10.790 --> 02:02:10.800 align:start position:0%
support letter that you received was
 
02:02:13.310 --> 02:02:13.320 align:start position:0%
rescinded uh you know later so now as
 
02:02:15.350 --> 02:02:15.360 align:start position:0%
you just said the rail trailers do not
 
02:02:16.970 --> 02:02:16.980 align:start position:0%
support the current the proposed
 
02:02:16.980 --> 02:02:17.870 align:start position:0%
support the current the proposed
solution

02:02:17.870 --> 02:02:17.880 align:start position:0%
solution
 
02:02:21.050 --> 02:02:21.060 align:start position:0%
is that that's good right so because I
 
02:02:23.089 --> 02:02:23.099 align:start position:0%
do consider the rail trails and you know
 
02:02:25.370 --> 02:02:25.380 align:start position:0%
the local people who are very involved
 
02:02:28.129 --> 02:02:28.139 align:start position:0%
in this to be significant stakeholders
 
02:02:28.139 --> 02:02:29.030 align:start position:0%
in this to be significant stakeholders
and

02:02:29.030 --> 02:02:29.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:02:31.189 --> 02:02:31.199 align:start position:0%
I am shocked that they are not here to
 
02:02:32.930 --> 02:02:32.940 align:start position:0%
testify and the only explanation I can
 
02:02:34.430 --> 02:02:34.440 align:start position:0%
think of is that they did not realize
 
02:02:36.169 --> 02:02:36.179 align:start position:0%
this bill was on the schedule it's very
 
02:02:38.330 --> 02:02:38.340 align:start position:0%
hard for normal people to keep track of
 
02:02:40.669 --> 02:02:40.679 align:start position:0%
the house schedule is there any way to
 
02:02:43.010 --> 02:02:43.020 align:start position:0%
have a second hearing on this bill just
 
02:02:45.290 --> 02:02:45.300 align:start position:0%
to make sure that all those people that
 
02:02:47.330 --> 02:02:47.340 align:start position:0%
showed up at every meeting related to
 
02:02:49.669 --> 02:02:49.679 align:start position:0%
this for the local meetings have an
 
02:02:52.790 --> 02:02:52.800 align:start position:0%
opportunity to testify
 
02:02:55.729 --> 02:02:55.739 align:start position:0%
you should go to division two and they
 
02:02:57.770 --> 02:02:57.780 align:start position:0%
will have another hearing and that will
 
02:03:09.050 --> 02:03:09.060 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:12.770 --> 02:03:12.780 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:16.970 --> 02:03:16.980 align:start position:0%
it's on it's on your schedule all right
 
02:03:18.709 --> 02:03:18.719 align:start position:0%
I'll go to division one
 
02:03:20.390 --> 02:03:20.400 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:03:20.400 --> 02:03:26.330 align:start position:0%
thank you
and

02:03:26.330 --> 02:03:26.340 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:29.450 --> 02:03:29.460 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:32.450 --> 02:03:32.460 align:start position:0%
not because it is dealing with DOT which
 
02:03:34.010 --> 02:03:34.020 align:start position:0%
is the
 
02:03:37.010 --> 02:03:37.020 align:start position:0%
um oversight by division two
 
02:03:37.020 --> 02:03:39.950 align:start position:0%
um oversight by division two
so

02:03:39.950 --> 02:03:39.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:42.470 --> 02:03:42.480 align:start position:0%
oh rails this is Department of Natural
 
02:03:45.350 --> 02:03:45.360 align:start position:0%
Resources which handles the rail Trails
 
02:03:47.390 --> 02:03:47.400 align:start position:0%
which goes to division one we've run
 
02:03:50.089 --> 02:03:50.099 align:start position:0%
into these things before so
 
02:03:52.729 --> 02:03:52.739 align:start position:0%
between the two of you obviously it's
 
02:03:54.649 --> 02:03:54.659 align:start position:0%
it's gone to division one because it is
 
02:03:56.629 --> 02:03:56.639 align:start position:0%
a rail trail bill
 
02:03:56.639 --> 02:03:57.830 align:start position:0%
a rail trail bill
and

02:03:57.830 --> 02:03:57.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:04:00.290 --> 02:04:00.300 align:start position:0%
they would welcome dot to come into the
 
02:04:02.270 --> 02:04:02.280 align:start position:0%
hearing and anybody else that wants to
 
02:04:04.310 --> 02:04:04.320 align:start position:0%
go hopefully we will see all these
 
02:04:07.250 --> 02:04:07.260 align:start position:0%
sketches and so on and there's another
 
02:04:09.470 --> 02:04:09.480 align:start position:0%
curious aspect here that no one has
 
02:04:11.030 --> 02:04:11.040 align:start position:0%
brought up yet
 
02:04:13.550 --> 02:04:13.560 align:start position:0%
savings from the elimination of the
 
02:04:15.410 --> 02:04:15.420 align:start position:0%
shared use Crossing
 
02:04:19.010 --> 02:04:19.020 align:start position:0%
of 375 thousand I wonder how that that
 
02:04:23.330 --> 02:04:23.340 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:27.290 --> 02:04:27.300 align:start position:0%
the 375 I'm that yeah it has it has in
 
02:04:28.490 --> 02:04:28.500 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
02:04:30.589 --> 02:04:30.599 align:start position:0%
the department of state's the department
 
02:04:32.330 --> 02:04:32.340 align:start position:0%
States the tunnel is estimated to cost
 
02:04:34.010 --> 02:04:34.020 align:start position:0%
one million one hundred and twenty five
 
02:04:36.649 --> 02:04:36.659 align:start position:0%
thousand to build and savings from the
 
02:04:39.790 --> 02:04:39.800 align:start position:0%
elimination of the shared use Crossing
 
02:04:42.649 --> 02:04:42.659 align:start position:0%
375 000 results in a net construction
 
02:04:46.370 --> 02:04:46.380 align:start position:0%
fiscal impact of approximately 750
 
02:04:46.380 --> 02:04:51.589 align:start position:0%
fiscal impact of approximately 750
000.

02:04:51.589 --> 02:04:51.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:53.570 --> 02:04:53.580 align:start position:0%
which is no one has commented on that I
 
02:04:56.149 --> 02:04:56.159 align:start position:0%
thought I'd bring it up yeah 750 000
 
02:04:56.159 --> 02:04:57.290 align:start position:0%
thought I'd bring it up yeah 750 000
savings

02:04:57.290 --> 02:04:57.300 align:start position:0%
savings
 
02:05:02.330 --> 02:05:02.340 align:start position:0%
no with 375 000 savings by eliminating
 
02:05:09.050 --> 02:05:09.060 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:11.990 --> 02:05:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:14.390 --> 02:05:14.400 align:start position:0%
representative erf wants to comment I I
 
02:05:15.649 --> 02:05:15.659 align:start position:0%
think what they're saying is what you're
 
02:05:17.930 --> 02:05:17.940 align:start position:0%
doing is going to cost some money and by
 
02:05:20.450 --> 02:05:20.460 align:start position:0%
applying that money to the 750 they get
 
02:05:22.390 --> 02:05:22.400 align:start position:0%
up to their total
 
02:05:26.390 --> 02:05:26.400 align:start position:0%
what the intent of the statement is to
 
02:05:31.430 --> 02:05:31.440 align:start position:0%
um is to say that by eliminating
 
02:05:33.410 --> 02:05:33.420 align:start position:0%
um and not constructing the second
 
02:05:36.290 --> 02:05:36.300 align:start position:0%
structure there's a cost savings to the
 
02:05:37.970 --> 02:05:37.980 align:start position:0%
project of seven hundred and fifty
 
02:05:39.350 --> 02:05:39.360 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars
 
02:05:42.530 --> 02:05:42.540 align:start position:0%
there is some additional costs that are
 
02:05:45.050 --> 02:05:45.060 align:start position:0%
associated with
 
02:05:48.169 --> 02:05:48.179 align:start position:0%
um the uh preferred alternative the
 
02:05:50.990 --> 02:05:51.000 align:start position:0%
scenic route that goes under the uh the
 
02:05:54.669 --> 02:05:54.679 align:start position:0%
uh the bridge the the roadway bridge
 
02:05:58.729 --> 02:05:58.739 align:start position:0%
that cuts into uh the cost savings so
 
02:06:02.450 --> 02:06:02.460 align:start position:0%
the the Box Culvert would be 1.125
 
02:06:04.430 --> 02:06:04.440 align:start position:0%
million and there's some additional
 
02:06:08.030 --> 02:06:08.040 align:start position:0%
costs for the one structure that would
 
02:06:12.709 --> 02:06:12.719 align:start position:0%
be included with the project of 375 and
 
02:06:15.470 --> 02:06:15.480 align:start position:0%
the net difference is the 750.
 
02:06:16.970 --> 02:06:16.980 align:start position:0%
maybe that could be worded a little
 
02:06:19.070 --> 02:06:19.080 align:start position:0%
differently but there are there was some
 
02:06:21.589 --> 02:06:21.599 align:start position:0%
additional work that was necessary to
 
02:06:23.510 --> 02:06:23.520 align:start position:0%
the shields Brook Bridge Crossing to
 
02:06:26.570 --> 02:06:26.580 align:start position:0%
accommodate the rail trail passing under
 
02:06:29.030 --> 02:06:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:35.149 --> 02:06:35.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:36.410 --> 02:06:36.420 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:06:40.669 --> 02:06:40.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:42.649 --> 02:06:42.659 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you for your testimony
 
02:06:46.010 --> 02:06:46.020 align:start position:0%
and you and okay representative McGuire
 
02:06:48.530 --> 02:06:48.540 align:start position:0%
has a question thank you just since you
 
02:06:50.510 --> 02:06:50.520 align:start position:0%
brought this up so the so the fiscal
 
02:06:54.109 --> 02:06:54.119 align:start position:0%
note says there's an additional 112 Five
 
02:06:57.589 --> 02:06:57.599 align:start position:0%
that's going to be needed for design so
 
02:07:00.649 --> 02:07:00.659 align:start position:0%
am I is am I reading this right that the
 
02:07:03.589 --> 02:07:03.599 align:start position:0%
750 and the bill is inadequate to do
 
02:07:05.870 --> 02:07:05.880 align:start position:0%
this full job
 
02:07:08.270 --> 02:07:08.280 align:start position:0%
you're reading it correctly
 
02:07:11.270 --> 02:07:11.280 align:start position:0%
and one may I follow up and is it
 
02:07:12.950 --> 02:07:12.960 align:start position:0%
anticipated that this money would come
 
02:07:15.350 --> 02:07:15.360 align:start position:0%
from the highway fund or because the
 
02:07:17.629 --> 02:07:17.639 align:start position:0%
bill doesn't seem to specify yeah I'm
 
02:07:19.970 --> 02:07:19.980 align:start position:0%
not I'm not sure where the money's going
 
02:07:24.649 --> 02:07:24.659 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:26.810 --> 02:07:26.820 align:start position:0%
any further questions
 
02:07:31.310 --> 02:07:31.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:36.530 --> 02:07:36.540 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:40.129 --> 02:07:40.139 align:start position:0%
it says that the bill makes a 750 000
 
02:07:42.470 --> 02:07:42.480 align:start position:0%
general fund appropriation for thistle
 
02:07:47.270 --> 02:07:47.280 align:start position:0%
yet 2024 to be used for cost related to
 
02:07:49.070 --> 02:07:49.080 align:start position:0%
the rail trail box Tunnel construction
 
02:07:49.080 --> 02:07:59.270 align:start position:0%
the rail trail box Tunnel construction
project

02:07:59.270 --> 02:07:59.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:01.189 --> 02:08:01.199 align:start position:0%
all right here we go
 
02:08:01.199 --> 02:08:02.149 align:start position:0%
all right here we go
um

02:08:02.149 --> 02:08:02.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:08:02.159 --> 02:08:04.910 align:start position:0%
um
the

02:08:04.910 --> 02:08:04.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:07.250 --> 02:08:07.260 align:start position:0%
if you're not building the rail trail
 
02:08:09.470 --> 02:08:09.480 align:start position:0%
box tunnel
 
02:08:09.480 --> 02:08:10.910 align:start position:0%
box tunnel
um

02:08:10.910 --> 02:08:10.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:08:14.050 --> 02:08:14.060 align:start position:0%
then I want to know what the 750 000
 
02:08:17.390 --> 02:08:17.400 align:start position:0%
pertains to in other words if you're if
 
02:08:20.209 --> 02:08:20.219 align:start position:0%
if you've uh
 
02:08:21.709 --> 02:08:21.719 align:start position:0%
if you've had
 
02:08:25.850 --> 02:08:25.860 align:start position:0%
uh funds if you had funds uh
 
02:08:28.790 --> 02:08:28.800 align:start position:0%
appropriated before this or is it 750
 
02:08:32.089 --> 02:08:32.099 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:32.099 --> 02:08:36.290 align:start position:0%
 
the

02:08:36.290 --> 02:08:36.300 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:38.330 --> 02:08:38.340 align:start position:0%
in the current proposal
 
02:08:40.790 --> 02:08:40.800 align:start position:0%
the tunnel the Box Culvert is not
 
02:08:42.830 --> 02:08:42.840 align:start position:0%
included okay
 
02:08:44.870 --> 02:08:44.880 align:start position:0%
The Advocates
 
02:08:47.390 --> 02:08:47.400 align:start position:0%
would like it included
 
02:08:50.030 --> 02:08:50.040 align:start position:0%
and and if we include it
 
02:08:52.189 --> 02:08:52.199 align:start position:0%
it'll cause it'll be a capital cost of
 
02:08:55.070 --> 02:08:55.080 align:start position:0%
approximately 750 000 dollars plus
 
02:08:57.169 --> 02:08:57.179 align:start position:0%
there'll be another 100 and something
 
02:09:01.729 --> 02:09:01.739 align:start position:0%
and change for uh design because we have
 
02:09:04.430 --> 02:09:04.440 align:start position:0%
to go back and we have to negotiate with
 
02:09:08.990 --> 02:09:09.000 align:start position:0%
our our uh our consultant
 
02:09:10.850 --> 02:09:10.860 align:start position:0%
um complete the design work that's
 
02:09:14.089 --> 02:09:14.099 align:start position:0%
necessary to accommodate the culvert and
 
02:09:14.099 --> 02:09:15.290 align:start position:0%
necessary to accommodate the culvert and
then

02:09:15.290 --> 02:09:15.300 align:start position:0%
then
 
02:09:15.300 --> 02:09:17.030 align:start position:0%
then
um

02:09:17.030 --> 02:09:17.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:09:19.070 --> 02:09:19.080 align:start position:0%
and that's all going to take time
 
02:09:21.050 --> 02:09:21.060 align:start position:0%
and it's going to add another six months
 
02:09:23.030 --> 02:09:23.040 align:start position:0%
on so so
 
02:09:25.189 --> 02:09:25.199 align:start position:0%
um I believe
 
02:09:27.830 --> 02:09:27.840 align:start position:0%
um part of uh the reason for this bill
 
02:09:30.229 --> 02:09:30.239 align:start position:0%
is so that
 
02:09:30.239 --> 02:09:32.990 align:start position:0%
is so that
um

02:09:32.990 --> 02:09:33.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:35.629 --> 02:09:35.639 align:start position:0%
the town of Derry maybe I don't know
 
02:09:37.310 --> 02:09:37.320 align:start position:0%
didn't have to pay the additional money
 
02:09:39.589 --> 02:09:39.599 align:start position:0%
or or somebody you know wouldn't come
 
02:09:41.089 --> 02:09:41.099 align:start position:0%
out of somebody else's pocket but it's
 
02:09:42.350 --> 02:09:42.360 align:start position:0%
coming out of the state's pocket anyway
 
02:09:47.629 --> 02:09:47.639 align:start position:0%
with a 750 000 so I I I'm unsure I'm
 
02:09:49.790 --> 02:09:49.800 align:start position:0%
really unsure
 
02:09:52.010 --> 02:09:52.020 align:start position:0%
roll up follow-up
 
02:09:52.020 --> 02:09:53.990 align:start position:0%
roll up follow-up
so

02:09:53.990 --> 02:09:54.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:09:59.390 --> 02:09:59.400 align:start position:0%
this bill appropriates 750 000 to the
 
02:10:01.070 --> 02:10:01.080 align:start position:0%
Department of Transportation to
 
02:10:04.370 --> 02:10:04.380 align:start position:0%
construct the rail trail boxed Tunnel
 
02:10:06.229 --> 02:10:06.239 align:start position:0%
construction project
 
02:10:06.239 --> 02:10:08.209 align:start position:0%
construction project
uh

02:10:08.209 --> 02:10:08.219 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:10:11.149 --> 02:10:11.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:13.189 --> 02:10:13.199 align:start position:0%
is that what it says
 
02:10:16.310 --> 02:10:16.320 align:start position:0%
that's what it says okay
 
02:10:22.790 --> 02:10:22.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:24.649 --> 02:10:24.659 align:start position:0%
any further questions from the committee
 
02:10:28.310 --> 02:10:28.320 align:start position:0%
members seeing none thank you very much
 
02:10:29.689 --> 02:10:29.699 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:10:29.699 --> 02:10:31.430 align:start position:0%
thank you
next

I'll next call on Alex katrubis
 
02:10:41.270 --> 02:10:41.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:44.390 --> 02:10:44.400 align:start position:0%
good afternoon thank you Mr chair uh
 
02:10:46.129 --> 02:10:46.139 align:start position:0%
most of you heard me this morning I'm
 
02:10:48.410 --> 02:10:48.420 align:start position:0%
Alex katrubis I'm here representing ACC

engineering firms throughout the state
 
02:10:58.129 --> 02:10:58.139 align:start position:0%
many of our firms work with New

02:11:09.109 --> 02:11:09.119 align:start position:0%
we're here today to oppose this
 
02:11:11.390 --> 02:11:11.400 align:start position:0%
legislation specifically lines three
 
02:11:13.790 --> 02:11:13.800 align:start position:0%
through six which uh as we've been
 
02:11:15.709 --> 02:11:15.719 align:start position:0%
discussing here would established a
 
02:11:18.410 --> 02:11:18.420 align:start position:0%
Class A misdemeanor penalty on any
 
02:11:20.450 --> 02:11:20.460 align:start position:0%
individual who negligently fails to
 
02:11:22.729 --> 02:11:22.739 align:start position:0%
construct or impedes in any way the
 
02:11:25.010 --> 02:11:25.020 align:start position:0%
completion of the rail trail box Tunnel
 
02:11:26.330 --> 02:11:26.340 align:start position:0%
construction project
 
02:11:28.310 --> 02:11:28.320 align:start position:0%
we believe this is a very dangerous
 
02:11:30.470 --> 02:11:30.480 align:start position:0%
precedent to threaten the state
 
02:11:32.689 --> 02:11:32.699 align:start position:0%
employees and as we read the bill it
 
02:11:35.030 --> 02:11:35.040 align:start position:0%
would also include consultants for a
 
02:11:35.040 --> 02:11:36.310 align:start position:0%
would also include consultants for a
specific

02:11:36.310 --> 02:11:36.320 align:start position:0%
specific
 
02:11:38.990 --> 02:11:39.000 align:start position:0%
uh design decisions that they're making
 
02:11:41.209 --> 02:11:41.219 align:start position:0%
on Public Works projects
 
02:11:43.490 --> 02:11:43.500 align:start position:0%
no one said it yet I don't think but the
 
02:11:44.930 --> 02:11:44.940 align:start position:0%
class A misdemeanor I looked at the
 
02:11:47.149 --> 02:11:47.159 align:start position:0%
department of safety's website
 
02:11:50.149 --> 02:11:50.159 align:start position:0%
it is a jail sentence of not less than
 
02:11:51.229 --> 02:11:51.239 align:start position:0%
one year
 
02:11:53.450 --> 02:11:53.460 align:start position:0%
or of less than one year excuse me of
 
02:11:55.129 --> 02:11:55.139 align:start position:0%
less than one year and a fine of two
 
02:11:56.870 --> 02:11:56.880 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars
 
02:12:00.470 --> 02:12:00.480 align:start position:0%
so that's what the penalty is uh
 
02:12:02.450 --> 02:12:02.460 align:start position:0%
obviously you all know we're able to
 
02:12:04.910 --> 02:12:04.920 align:start position:0%
wide 993 from Salem to Manchester we
 
02:12:06.589 --> 02:12:06.599 align:start position:0%
didn't threaten anyone with a Class A
 
02:12:09.050 --> 02:12:09.060 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor to get it done we we built
 
02:12:10.850 --> 02:12:10.860 align:start position:0%
the Memorial Bridge we built the sour
 
02:12:12.770 --> 02:12:12.780 align:start position:0%
Mildred Long Bridge we've done a lot of
 
02:12:14.510 --> 02:12:14.520 align:start position:0%
really great Public Works projects
 
02:12:16.609 --> 02:12:16.619 align:start position:0%
without putting a gun to people's heads
 
02:12:19.669 --> 02:12:19.679 align:start position:0%
so the bill is uh as representative
 
02:12:21.890 --> 02:12:21.900 align:start position:0%
Edwards and the chairman pointed out
 
02:12:24.470 --> 02:12:24.480 align:start position:0%
it's it's really poorly drafted the
 
02:12:26.270 --> 02:12:26.280 align:start position:0%
first sentence says any person and then
 
02:12:27.649 --> 02:12:27.659 align:start position:0%
it's specifically in the next sentence
 
02:12:30.410 --> 02:12:30.420 align:start position:0%
names three people so which one is it is
 
02:12:32.930 --> 02:12:32.940 align:start position:0%
it any person or is it just those three
 
02:12:32.940 --> 02:12:33.830 align:start position:0%
it any person or is it just those three
people

02:12:33.830 --> 02:12:33.840 align:start position:0%
people
 
02:12:36.770 --> 02:12:36.780 align:start position:0%
uh you know if the executive if by some
 
02:12:38.629 --> 02:12:38.639 align:start position:0%
miracle this was to get signed into law
 
02:12:41.089 --> 02:12:41.099 align:start position:0%
which I highly doubt would happen uh you
 
02:12:42.589 --> 02:12:42.599 align:start position:0%
could argue that the executive Council
 
02:12:44.810 --> 02:12:44.820 align:start position:0%
if they rejected the contract amendment
 
02:12:46.430 --> 02:12:46.440 align:start position:0%
to build this you just heard it's going
 
02:12:47.990 --> 02:12:48.000 align:start position:0%
to take a contract Amendment could the
 
02:12:51.050 --> 02:12:51.060 align:start position:0%
executive Council uh you know be charged
 
02:12:52.430 --> 02:12:52.440 align:start position:0%
with a misdemeanor are we going to issue
 
02:12:54.950 --> 02:12:54.960 align:start position:0%
a warrant for for their arrest so it it
 
02:12:56.810 --> 02:12:56.820 align:start position:0%
doesn't seem to be a pretty a really
 
02:12:59.209 --> 02:12:59.219 align:start position:0%
serious attempt to uh solve this issue I
 
02:13:01.250 --> 02:13:01.260 align:start position:0%
would recommend that you know the folks
 
02:13:03.709 --> 02:13:03.719 align:start position:0%
who are trying to do this work with uh
 
02:13:05.569 --> 02:13:05.579 align:start position:0%
Dot and try to come up with some kind of
 
02:13:07.729 --> 02:13:07.739 align:start position:0%
a compromise but obviously this is this
 
02:13:09.290 --> 02:13:09.300 align:start position:0%
is not the way to do it I've sent this
 
02:13:13.390 --> 02:13:13.400 align:start position:0%
bill to a lot of Engineers and uh the
 
02:13:15.830 --> 02:13:15.840 align:start position:0%
responses have been fairly amusing as
 
02:13:17.870 --> 02:13:17.880 align:start position:0%
you can imagine I think somebody called
 
02:13:19.729 --> 02:13:19.739 align:start position:0%
it a dumpster fire so I'll just leave it
 
02:13:22.189 --> 02:13:22.199 align:start position:0%
at that so thank you very much uh Mr
 
02:13:24.589 --> 02:13:24.599 align:start position:0%
chairman we'd obviously urge you to it
 
02:13:26.629 --> 02:13:26.639 align:start position:0%
all this bill and let this project move
 
02:13:27.950 --> 02:13:27.960 align:start position:0%
forward I mean the governor has said
 
02:13:30.109 --> 02:13:30.119 align:start position:0%
Governor sunino had said that he
 
02:13:31.729 --> 02:13:31.739 align:start position:0%
remembers going to meetings with his
 
02:13:33.410 --> 02:13:33.420 align:start position:0%
father when he was governor talking
 
02:13:36.050 --> 02:13:36.060 align:start position:0%
about exit 4A so that's how long we've
 
02:13:38.030 --> 02:13:38.040 align:start position:0%
been talking about this thing so this is
 
02:13:39.470 --> 02:13:39.480 align:start position:0%
going to you know delay it another six
 
02:13:41.209 --> 02:13:41.219 align:start position:0%
months another you know and that's
 
02:13:44.450 --> 02:13:44.460 align:start position:0%
probably a best case scenario so dot has
 
02:13:46.189 --> 02:13:46.199 align:start position:0%
done a lot of work on this they're the
 
02:13:48.350 --> 02:13:48.360 align:start position:0%
experts certainly if the legislature
 
02:13:50.689 --> 02:13:50.699 align:start position:0%
were to pass a law to require this the
 
02:13:52.490 --> 02:13:52.500 align:start position:0%
the engineer the consultant would follow
 
02:13:54.350 --> 02:13:54.360 align:start position:0%
the direction of their client the dot
 
02:13:56.569 --> 02:13:56.579 align:start position:0%
and and get them done with what they
 
02:13:58.910 --> 02:13:58.920 align:start position:0%
need to get done so we don't really have
 
02:14:01.010 --> 02:14:01.020 align:start position:0%
a real position on whether or not it
 
02:14:02.209 --> 02:14:02.219 align:start position:0%
should be included but certainly the
 
02:14:04.790 --> 02:14:04.800 align:start position:0%
penalty section is uh
 
02:14:07.430 --> 02:14:07.440 align:start position:0%
really not good public policy thank you
 
02:14:08.270 --> 02:14:08.280 align:start position:0%
very much
 
02:14:09.950 --> 02:14:09.960 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony will you

representative Edwards uh yes sir I'm
 
02:18:46.669 --> 02:18:46.679 align:start position:0%
I'm just trying to make sure I
 
02:18:48.950 --> 02:18:48.960 align:start position:0%
understand our our process I I don't
 
02:18:51.589 --> 02:18:51.599 align:start position:0%
recall reading all the names in past
 
02:18:54.230 --> 02:18:54.240 align:start position:0%
terms and is this a new rule or is this
 
02:18:56.929 --> 02:18:56.939 align:start position:0%
your effort to increase transparency and
 
02:18:59.690 --> 02:18:59.700 align:start position:0%
public participation are we required to
 
02:19:02.389 --> 02:19:02.399 align:start position:0%
read those or or was that your did you
 
02:19:04.669 --> 02:19:04.679 align:start position:0%
exercise an option
 
02:19:06.889 --> 02:19:06.899 align:start position:0%
guess you could say exercise an option
 
02:19:10.129 --> 02:19:10.139 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:12.110 --> 02:19:12.120 align:start position:0%
usually the list isn't quite as lengthy
 
02:19:14.690 --> 02:19:14.700 align:start position:0%
but there might be names in there that
 
02:19:16.549 --> 02:19:16.559 align:start position:0%
you know those of you that represent
 
02:19:18.709 --> 02:19:18.719 align:start position:0%
those towns might want to pay attention
 
02:19:20.570 --> 02:19:20.580 align:start position:0%
because you may get a call from those
 
02:19:22.849 --> 02:19:22.859 align:start position:0%
people wondering did you know that I
 
02:19:24.830 --> 02:19:24.840 align:start position:0%
support or oppose this bill and you'll
 
02:19:27.589 --> 02:19:27.599 align:start position:0%
say yes it was it was read out in the
 
02:19:29.450 --> 02:19:29.460 align:start position:0%
committee and I am aware of that thank
 
02:19:44.049 --> 02:19:44.059 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:45.770 --> 02:19:45.780 align:start position:0%
me too
 
02:19:50.270 --> 02:19:50.280 align:start position:0%
all right anything further on this bill
 
02:19:53.510 --> 02:19:53.520 align:start position:0%
hearing none we will be in recess till
 
02:19:56.630 --> 02:19:56.640 align:start position:0%
one o'clock when we'll be coming back to
 
02:20:00.170 --> 02:20:00.180 align:start position:0%
hear about HB 49 relative to postponing
 
02:20:01.730 --> 02:20:01.740 align:start position:0%
the closure of synonym youth service
 
02:20:05.590 --> 02:20:05.600 align:start position:0%
center Mr Mr chair before you gamble
 
02:20:09.230 --> 02:20:09.240 align:start position:0%
as the sponsor of 49 and and knowing
 
02:20:12.230 --> 02:20:12.240 align:start position:0%
what it is relative to a parallel Bill
 
02:20:15.530 --> 02:20:15.540 align:start position:0%
running in the Senate and the house I I
 
02:20:19.130 --> 02:20:19.140 align:start position:0%
believe that we could do 49 in in 30
 
02:20:21.830 --> 02:20:21.840 align:start position:0%
minutes so that you can still stick to
 
02:20:26.150 --> 02:20:26.160 align:start position:0%
the two o'clock for hb50 and and if if
 
02:20:29.030 --> 02:20:29.040 align:start position:0%
you recessed us until 1 30 I think
 
02:20:30.650 --> 02:20:30.660 align:start position:0%
you're compliant with the rules and
 
02:20:32.330 --> 02:20:32.340 align:start position:0%
you're giving everyone a chance to take
 
02:20:35.330 --> 02:20:35.340 align:start position:0%
a break so my recommendation would be to
 
02:20:37.370 --> 02:20:37.380 align:start position:0%
recesses to 130 for just your
 
02:20:39.710 --> 02:20:39.720 align:start position:0%
consideration sir
 
02:20:43.550 --> 02:20:43.560 align:start position:0%
any objection from any members
 
02:20:45.230 --> 02:20:45.240 align:start position:0%
all right
 
02:20:47.150 --> 02:20:47.160 align:start position:0%
anybody that shows up at one o'clock
 
02:20:48.950 --> 02:20:48.960 align:start position:0%
will tell them that the
 
02:20:51.950 --> 02:20:51.960 align:start position:0%
it has been recessed until 1 30. I may
 
02:20:53.630 --> 02:20:53.640 align:start position:0%
open the hearing at one o'clock to
 
02:20:55.370 --> 02:20:55.380 align:start position:0%
announce that just to be accurate
 
02:20:58.010 --> 02:20:58.020 align:start position:0%
because that is what is posted
 
02:21:01.490 --> 02:21:01.500 align:start position:0%
thank you one I will be back here at one
 
02:21:05.570 --> 02:21:05.580 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:05.580 --> 02:22:50.570 align:start position:0%
 
49.

02:22:50.570 --> 02:22:50.580 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:54.290 --> 02:22:54.300 align:start position:0%
it's good for them to know yeah it is
 
02:22:56.750 --> 02:22:56.760 align:start position:0%
she said that my son and the guy working
 
02:22:59.090 --> 02:22:59.100 align:start position:0%
for me broke into her apartment
 
02:23:01.790 --> 02:23:01.800 align:start position:0%
to do drugs and drink beer and they
 
02:23:04.790 --> 02:23:04.800 align:start position:0%
don't do drugs or drink beer
 
02:23:05.990 --> 02:23:06.000 align:start position:0%
I think
 
02:24:02.870 --> 02:24:02.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:02.880 --> 02:24:07.429 align:start position:0%
 
environment

02:24:07.429 --> 02:24:07.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:09.290 --> 02:24:09.300 align:start position:0%
see if I can grow you from somewhere
 
02:24:12.050 --> 02:24:12.060 align:start position:0%
well I've been on uh public works for
 
02:24:15.110 --> 02:24:15.120 align:start position:0%
five terms so I'm just it's really
 
02:24:28.849 --> 02:24:28.859 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:30.950 --> 02:24:30.960 align:start position:0%
I don't know which yeah I know
 
02:24:42.050 --> 02:24:42.060 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:44.270 --> 02:24:44.280 align:start position:0%
Solid Waste issues are
 
02:24:46.910 --> 02:24:46.920 align:start position:0%
bad news
 
02:24:50.270 --> 02:24:50.280 align:start position:0%
you probably hear more about it see you
 
02:24:50.280 --> 02:24:53.929 align:start position:0%
you probably hear more about it see you
later

02:24:53.929 --> 02:24:53.939 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:22.730 --> 02:25:22.740 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:24.650 --> 02:25:24.660 align:start position:0%
they take their
 
03:31:53.269 --> 03:31:53.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:53.279 --> 03:32:14.510 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:32:14.510 --> 03:32:14.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:17.450 --> 03:32:17.460 align:start position:0%

uh Rockingham District 31
 
03:32:46.450 --> 03:32:46.460 align:start position:0%
that's Auburn Candia Chester Deerfield
 
03:32:50.889 --> 03:32:50.899 align:start position:0%
I'm here to introduce a house bill
 
03:32:53.450 --> 03:32:53.460 align:start position:0%
49. this is an act relative to
 
03:32:55.670 --> 03:32:55.680 align:start position:0%
postponing the closure of the sununu
 
03:32:59.150 --> 03:32:59.160 align:start position:0%
Youth Services Center
 
03:32:59.160 --> 03:32:59.710 align:start position:0%
Youth Services Center
um

03:32:59.710 --> 03:32:59.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:33:03.410 --> 03:33:03.420 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm going to ask for the chairman to
 
03:33:06.050 --> 03:33:06.060 align:start position:0%
consider simply retaining this bill and
 
03:33:09.710 --> 03:33:09.720 align:start position:0%
and I'll explain why uh this this is
 
03:33:11.929 --> 03:33:11.939 align:start position:0%
like the little red box that you see as
 
03:33:14.570 --> 03:33:14.580 align:start position:0%
you walk down the hallway it says in
 
03:33:16.190 --> 03:33:16.200 align:start position:0%
case of time
 
03:33:19.550 --> 03:33:19.560 align:start position:0%
uh I at this point am extremely
 
03:33:23.570 --> 03:33:23.580 align:start position:0%
optimistic that this bill is is not
 
03:33:26.030 --> 03:33:26.040 align:start position:0%
actually going to need to be considered
 
03:33:28.610 --> 03:33:28.620 align:start position:0%
for an OTP because
 
03:33:31.250 --> 03:33:31.260 align:start position:0%
um things are going very well with the
 
03:33:33.290 --> 03:33:33.300 align:start position:0%
real plan the real plan that you don't
 
03:33:36.889 --> 03:33:36.899 align:start position:0%
see before you today is that the house
 
03:33:39.010 --> 03:33:39.020 align:start position:0%
and the Senate have been running
 
03:33:43.010 --> 03:33:43.020 align:start position:0%
parallel activities to get a a complete
 
03:33:46.210 --> 03:33:46.220 align:start position:0%
synonym replacement built together
 
03:33:49.670 --> 03:33:49.680 align:start position:0%
in the on the on the Senate side it's
 
03:33:51.950 --> 03:33:51.960 align:start position:0%
sp1 and it's been amended a couple of
 
03:33:56.710 --> 03:33:56.720 align:start position:0%
times on the house side it's hb120
 
03:33:59.030 --> 03:33:59.040 align:start position:0%
that's got one Amendment and I'm
 
03:34:01.070 --> 03:34:01.080 align:start position:0%
introducing another one on Tuesday to
 
03:34:03.530 --> 03:34:03.540 align:start position:0%
Children and Family Law
 
03:34:05.929 --> 03:34:05.939 align:start position:0%
um the good news these to to me the
 
03:34:08.570 --> 03:34:08.580 align:start position:0%
metaphor is we have two horses running
 
03:34:13.130 --> 03:34:13.140 align:start position:0%
down uh in parallel paths we need one of
 
03:34:15.590 --> 03:34:15.600 align:start position:0%
them to win and we want them to win as
 
03:34:18.469 --> 03:34:18.479 align:start position:0%
quickly as possible uh because what
 
03:34:20.750 --> 03:34:20.760 align:start position:0%
we're trying the crisis we're trying to
 
03:34:23.150 --> 03:34:23.160 align:start position:0%
avoid is that under current law the
 
03:34:26.150 --> 03:34:26.160 align:start position:0%
sununu center closes on one March
 
03:34:28.550 --> 03:34:28.560 align:start position:0%
for those of you with a wristwatch one
 
03:34:32.750 --> 03:34:32.760 align:start position:0%
March is like five weeks and there is no
 
03:34:36.469 --> 03:34:36.479 align:start position:0%
real plan for what to do with the people
 
03:34:39.530 --> 03:34:39.540 align:start position:0%
who are residents of that facility some
 
03:34:41.510 --> 03:34:41.520 align:start position:0%
of them may end up having to get sent
 
03:34:43.490 --> 03:34:43.500 align:start position:0%
out of state if they have to close on
 
03:34:45.710 --> 03:34:45.720 align:start position:0%
one March some of them may end up going
 
03:34:47.809 --> 03:34:47.819 align:start position:0%
into like a level four instead of a
 
03:34:49.849 --> 03:34:49.859 align:start position:0%
level five secure facility which
 
03:34:51.849 --> 03:34:51.859 align:start position:0%
increases Public
 
03:34:56.389 --> 03:34:56.399 align:start position:0%
Safety chances or risks so
 
03:34:59.570 --> 03:34:59.580 align:start position:0%
so we want to avoid the premature
 
03:35:02.570 --> 03:35:02.580 align:start position:0%
closure of the sununu center
 
03:35:05.150 --> 03:35:05.160 align:start position:0%
now why are we waiting until this term
 
03:35:08.570 --> 03:35:08.580 align:start position:0%
to deal with this well because we had a
 
03:35:10.610 --> 03:35:10.620 align:start position:0%
very nice compromise between the house
 
03:35:13.870 --> 03:35:13.880 align:start position:0%
and the Senate at the end of last term
 
03:35:16.370 --> 03:35:16.380 align:start position:0%
that got set up for a committee of
 
03:35:19.929 --> 03:35:19.939 align:start position:0%
conference the committee a conference
 
03:35:23.990 --> 03:35:24.000 align:start position:0%
somebody on the in the other house saw
 
03:35:25.370 --> 03:35:25.380 align:start position:0%
that we
 
03:35:25.380 --> 03:35:26.570 align:start position:0%
that we
um

03:35:26.570 --> 03:35:26.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:35:29.510 --> 03:35:29.520 align:start position:0%
could could no that's a different
 
03:35:31.370 --> 03:35:31.380 align:start position:0%
committee a conference story I have so
 
03:35:34.490 --> 03:35:34.500 align:start position:0%
many stories uh no what what happened on
 
03:35:37.550 --> 03:35:37.560 align:start position:0%
this one was on the committee conference
 
03:35:40.010 --> 03:35:40.020 align:start position:0%
um the agreements going into that formal
 
03:35:42.110 --> 03:35:42.120 align:start position:0%
meeting between the house and the Senate
 
03:35:45.530 --> 03:35:45.540 align:start position:0%
was around capacity
 
03:35:51.110 --> 03:35:51.120 align:start position:0%
and uh the speaker and the Senate wanted
 
03:35:55.670 --> 03:35:55.680 align:start position:0%
a capacity of 12 operationally
 
03:35:58.849 --> 03:35:58.859 align:start position:0%
with an ability to go to 18 if there was
 
03:36:02.570 --> 03:36:02.580 align:start position:0%
an exurgent reason to do so Exogen I
 
03:36:02.580 --> 03:36:03.309 align:start position:0%
an exurgent reason to do so Exogen I
guess

03:36:03.309 --> 03:36:03.319 align:start position:0%
guess
 
03:36:03.319 --> 03:36:04.969 align:start position:0%
guess
and

03:36:04.969 --> 03:36:04.979 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:36:09.110 --> 03:36:09.120 align:start position:0%
um and the house representative
 
03:36:09.120 --> 03:36:10.030 align:start position:0%
um and the house representative
um

03:36:10.030 --> 03:36:10.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:36:12.950 --> 03:36:12.960 align:start position:0%
decided despite assurances to the
 
03:36:15.290 --> 03:36:15.300 align:start position:0%
speaker beforehand decided to go with
 
03:36:18.910 --> 03:36:18.920 align:start position:0%
six instead of the 12 to 18
 
03:36:21.170 --> 03:36:21.180 align:start position:0%
and that caused the committee a
 
03:36:24.110 --> 03:36:24.120 align:start position:0%
conference process to collapse which
 
03:36:27.349 --> 03:36:27.359 align:start position:0%
left us stuck with this legislative date
 
03:36:30.830 --> 03:36:30.840 align:start position:0%
and statute of closing on one March we
 
03:36:34.250 --> 03:36:34.260 align:start position:0%
we basically failed to do our job so so
 
03:36:36.469 --> 03:36:36.479 align:start position:0%
this term we've been trying to Fast
 
03:36:39.889 --> 03:36:39.899 align:start position:0%
Track these bills uh division three has
 
03:36:41.809 --> 03:36:41.819 align:start position:0%
been invited to the children and family
 
03:36:44.210 --> 03:36:44.220 align:start position:0%
law committee so that while they
 
03:36:46.490 --> 03:36:46.500 align:start position:0%
formally heard that a larger replacement
 
03:36:49.309 --> 03:36:49.319 align:start position:0%
bill that was predicated on the
 
03:36:51.950 --> 03:36:51.960 align:start position:0%
committee conference agreement I think
 
03:36:54.650 --> 03:36:54.660 align:start position:0%
we had a majority of division three at
 
03:36:57.769 --> 03:36:57.779 align:start position:0%
that children and family law so the so
 
03:37:00.769 --> 03:37:00.779 align:start position:0%
your committee sir is is is tracking
 
03:37:02.950 --> 03:37:02.960 align:start position:0%
along with this for the most part
 
03:37:06.110 --> 03:37:06.120 align:start position:0%
and I think I think we're in a really
 
03:37:07.330 --> 03:37:07.340 align:start position:0%
good position
 
03:37:11.870 --> 03:37:11.880 align:start position:0%
to receive the Senate version
 
03:37:15.710 --> 03:37:15.720 align:start position:0%
that passed today unanimously
 
03:37:18.769 --> 03:37:18.779 align:start position:0%
so so that that's a good sign it's going
 
03:37:20.510 --> 03:37:20.520 align:start position:0%
to come over the house
 
03:37:22.969 --> 03:37:22.979 align:start position:0%
the clerk and the speaker are talking
 
03:37:24.349 --> 03:37:24.359 align:start position:0%
about it
 
03:37:29.150 --> 03:37:29.160 align:start position:0%
uh the idea is that we're going to
 
03:37:31.070 --> 03:37:31.080 align:start position:0%
continue to Fast Track the Senate
 
03:37:34.790 --> 03:37:34.800 align:start position:0%
version of the full replacement bill
 
03:37:38.389 --> 03:37:38.399 align:start position:0%
um and my proposal to the majority
 
03:37:41.750 --> 03:37:41.760 align:start position:0%
leader and others was since children and
 
03:37:43.969 --> 03:37:43.979 align:start position:0%
family law has heard so much of the bill
 
03:37:47.210 --> 03:37:47.220 align:start position:0%
if they could forego and waive another
 
03:37:49.130 --> 03:37:49.140 align:start position:0%
Committee hearing on it
 
03:37:51.229 --> 03:37:51.239 align:start position:0%
then it could come straight to finance
 
03:37:53.809 --> 03:37:53.819 align:start position:0%
and then we could get it onto the floor
 
03:37:56.150 --> 03:37:56.160 align:start position:0%
faster and I don't know what's going to
 
03:37:58.090 --> 03:37:58.100 align:start position:0%
happen on the floor
 
03:38:02.269 --> 03:38:02.279 align:start position:0%
I I'm I'm I'm hopeful that given the
 
03:38:05.450 --> 03:38:05.460 align:start position:0%
Senate unanimous approval of it that we
 
03:38:07.849 --> 03:38:07.859 align:start position:0%
can get a majority of the house to
 
03:38:11.389 --> 03:38:11.399 align:start position:0%
approve sb1 as amended
 
03:38:14.090 --> 03:38:14.100 align:start position:0%
if we cannot
 
03:38:17.510 --> 03:38:17.520 align:start position:0%
that's why we need a HP 49 this is the
 
03:38:21.769 --> 03:38:21.779 align:start position:0%
break glass option if we can't do sb1
 
03:38:24.530 --> 03:38:24.540 align:start position:0%
through the house we need to get
 
03:38:27.710 --> 03:38:27.720 align:start position:0%
something to the governor you know late
 
03:38:30.590 --> 03:38:30.600 align:start position:0%
February at the at the latest otherwise
 
03:38:34.070 --> 03:38:34.080 align:start position:0%
we've got a uh a crisis over there in
 
03:38:35.450 --> 03:38:35.460 align:start position:0%
the sununu center
 
03:38:38.630 --> 03:38:38.640 align:start position:0%
and and with that I'll I'm happy to take
 
03:38:38.640 --> 03:38:41.330 align:start position:0%
and and with that I'll I'm happy to take
questions

03:38:41.330 --> 03:38:41.340 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:43.969 --> 03:38:43.979 align:start position:0%
questions from of Representative Edwards
 
03:38:47.150 --> 03:38:47.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:50.690 --> 03:38:50.700 align:start position:0%
representative Wallner for a question
 
03:38:52.429 --> 03:38:52.439 align:start position:0%
so regardless
 
03:38:53.510 --> 03:38:53.520 align:start position:0%
regardless with
 
03:38:56.870 --> 03:38:56.880 align:start position:0%
with Bill one or house bill 120.
 
03:39:00.170 --> 03:39:00.180 align:start position:0%
wouldn't it make more sense for us to
 
03:39:03.650 --> 03:39:03.660 align:start position:0%
put a more realistic date on this one
 
03:39:07.550 --> 03:39:07.560 align:start position:0%
because 49 probably can move along as
 
03:39:09.530 --> 03:39:09.540 align:start position:0%
quickly as anything we can get it
 
03:39:12.490 --> 03:39:12.500 align:start position:0%
through the floor so that the date is
 
03:39:15.229 --> 03:39:15.239 align:start position:0%
more reasonable I mean right you only
 
03:39:17.269 --> 03:39:17.279 align:start position:0%
give us now until June to build a
 
03:39:19.610 --> 03:39:19.620 align:start position:0%
building or to get everybody moved out
 
03:39:22.250 --> 03:39:22.260 align:start position:0%
so if we moved it out a couple of years
 
03:39:24.469 --> 03:39:24.479 align:start position:0%
wouldn't that be
 
03:39:27.530 --> 03:39:27.540 align:start position:0%
an alternative to have this at least we
 
03:39:30.050 --> 03:39:30.060 align:start position:0%
would have this piece of it for sure
 
03:39:32.690 --> 03:39:32.700 align:start position:0%
taken care of as the rest of it as the
 
03:39:34.610 --> 03:39:34.620 align:start position:0%
other two bills move through and they
 
03:39:37.010 --> 03:39:37.020 align:start position:0%
could stumble at any point okay so
 
03:39:40.010 --> 03:39:40.020 align:start position:0%
representative Wallner I uh I know that
 
03:39:42.429 --> 03:39:42.439 align:start position:0%
you've been following this for for years
 
03:39:46.550 --> 03:39:46.560 align:start position:0%
and I I know that that your support on
 
03:39:49.190 --> 03:39:49.200 align:start position:0%
what we do is really important to what
 
03:39:51.950 --> 03:39:51.960 align:start position:0%
the house action is ultimately
 
03:39:56.030 --> 03:39:56.040 align:start position:0%
uh I have come to believe that the best
 
03:40:00.410 --> 03:40:00.420 align:start position:0%
bet to to fix the problem is to agree
 
03:40:03.229 --> 03:40:03.239 align:start position:0%
with the Senate's unanimous support for
 
03:40:07.010 --> 03:40:07.020 align:start position:0%
sb1 is amended and to run that up the
 
03:40:12.290 --> 03:40:12.300 align:start position:0%
flagpole first and if we can't get sb1
 
03:40:12.300 --> 03:40:14.090 align:start position:0%
flagpole first and if we can't get sb1
passed

03:40:14.090 --> 03:40:14.100 align:start position:0%
passed
 
03:40:17.150 --> 03:40:17.160 align:start position:0%
then I would see assuming this comes the
 
03:40:20.030 --> 03:40:20.040 align:start position:0%
division three I could see division
 
03:40:20.040 --> 03:40:21.469 align:start position:0%
division three I could see division
three

03:40:21.469 --> 03:40:21.479 align:start position:0%
three
 
03:40:24.110 --> 03:40:24.120 align:start position:0%
sending it to the full finance committee
 
03:40:26.630 --> 03:40:26.640 align:start position:0%
after we know the disposition of sb1 in
 
03:40:30.590 --> 03:40:30.600 align:start position:0%
the house to take corrective remedial
 
03:40:33.170 --> 03:40:33.180 align:start position:0%
break glass action
 
03:40:36.650 --> 03:40:36.660 align:start position:0%
so I I don't know what is to be gained
 
03:40:41.690 --> 03:40:41.700 align:start position:0%
by messing with sb49 because I think the
 
03:40:43.790 --> 03:40:43.800 align:start position:0%
odds at this point is that we can get
 
03:40:46.550 --> 03:40:46.560 align:start position:0%
sb1 and it's and it's the long-term fix
 
03:40:49.130 --> 03:40:49.140 align:start position:0%
let's let's just fix it instead of
 
03:40:53.530 --> 03:40:53.540 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:57.130 --> 03:40:57.140 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:00.530 --> 03:41:00.540 align:start position:0%
representative Stringham for a question
 
03:41:03.050 --> 03:41:03.060 align:start position:0%
um being relatively new to this issue
 
03:41:09.830 --> 03:41:09.840 align:start position:0%
does sb1 address where the um current uh
 
03:41:12.490 --> 03:41:12.500 align:start position:0%
Resonance of the sununu youth center
 
03:41:17.210 --> 03:41:17.220 align:start position:0%
would go between March 1st and when the
 
03:41:17.220 --> 03:41:18.309 align:start position:0%
would go between March 1st and when the
new

03:41:18.309 --> 03:41:18.319 align:start position:0%
new
 
03:41:21.950 --> 03:41:21.960 align:start position:0%
long-term solution is is on board
 
03:41:24.290 --> 03:41:24.300 align:start position:0%
um thank you thank you for the question
 
03:41:26.690 --> 03:41:26.700 align:start position:0%
and the answer is yes what what what
 
03:41:28.670 --> 03:41:28.680 align:start position:0%
what would happen is the sections of
 
03:41:31.969 --> 03:41:31.979 align:start position:0%
current law that close it on one March
 
03:41:35.809 --> 03:41:35.819 align:start position:0%
would would be repealed and in its place
 
03:41:37.630 --> 03:41:37.640 align:start position:0%
it would say
 
03:41:41.210 --> 03:41:41.220 align:start position:0%
here's a replacement facility that meets
 
03:41:43.130 --> 03:41:43.140 align:start position:0%
the following kind of conditions and
 
03:41:46.550 --> 03:41:46.560 align:start position:0%
requirements and once it's open for
 
03:41:49.429 --> 03:41:49.439 align:start position:0%
business I I use the term go live in a
 
03:41:51.650 --> 03:41:51.660 align:start position:0%
software term but when when we can go
 
03:41:54.370 --> 03:41:54.380 align:start position:0%
live in the in the replacement facility
 
03:41:58.190 --> 03:41:58.200 align:start position:0%
the residents will be transferred and at
 
03:42:01.490 --> 03:42:01.500 align:start position:0%
that point the the current sununu Center
 
03:42:03.950 --> 03:42:03.960 align:start position:0%
would be closed down and it would be
 
03:42:07.010 --> 03:42:07.020 align:start position:0%
closed down for any new Admissions and
 
03:42:09.290 --> 03:42:09.300 align:start position:0%
all the new any new activity after
 
03:42:11.990 --> 03:42:12.000 align:start position:0%
opening of the new facility would be in
 
03:42:13.670 --> 03:42:13.680 align:start position:0%
the new facility
 
03:42:15.530 --> 03:42:15.540 align:start position:0%
to just kind of take it a little bit
 
03:42:18.769 --> 03:42:18.779 align:start position:0%
further It also says that the existing
 
03:42:21.830 --> 03:42:21.840 align:start position:0%
sununu Center would then go under the
 
03:42:23.090 --> 03:42:23.100 align:start position:0%
control of the Department of
 
03:42:25.969 --> 03:42:25.979 align:start position:0%
administrative services and would be
 
03:42:28.190 --> 03:42:28.200 align:start position:0%
available for
 
03:42:28.200 --> 03:42:29.229 align:start position:0%
available for
um

03:42:29.229 --> 03:42:29.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:42:32.450 --> 03:42:32.460 align:start position:0%
I I've called it disposal somebody came
 
03:42:34.910 --> 03:42:34.920 align:start position:0%
up with a smarter word that starts with
 
03:42:38.229 --> 03:42:38.239 align:start position:0%
r but recycling re
 
03:42:42.010 --> 03:42:42.020 align:start position:0%
Reclamation but essentially
 
03:42:45.650 --> 03:42:45.660 align:start position:0%
doing something with it and and and one
 
03:42:47.450 --> 03:42:47.460 align:start position:0%
of the bright ideas that I've heard in
 
03:42:49.309 --> 03:42:49.319 align:start position:0%
the last 24 hours that the department
 
03:42:52.429 --> 03:42:52.439 align:start position:0%
could look at is maybe taking that empty
 
03:42:54.950 --> 03:42:54.960 align:start position:0%
facility that was sort of built on a on
 
03:42:56.530 --> 03:42:56.540 align:start position:0%
a jail
 
03:43:01.309 --> 03:43:01.319 align:start position:0%
basis maybe making that so that the
 
03:43:04.429 --> 03:43:04.439 align:start position:0%
secure forensic hospital that we said
 
03:43:07.990 --> 03:43:08.000 align:start position:0%
should be replaced so that we can get
 
03:43:11.450 --> 03:43:11.460 align:start position:0%
Patients Out of the prison maybe maybe
 
03:43:13.729 --> 03:43:13.739 align:start position:0%
it can be remodeled for that adult use
 
03:43:16.010 --> 03:43:16.020 align:start position:0%
once the kids are gone I think that's a
 
03:43:20.269 --> 03:43:20.279 align:start position:0%
genius idea that probably would be
 
03:43:22.370 --> 03:43:22.380 align:start position:0%
worthy of discussion at some point it
 
03:43:24.410 --> 03:43:24.420 align:start position:0%
was way beyond your question but the
 
03:43:27.229 --> 03:43:27.239 align:start position:0%
short answer your question is yes
 
03:43:29.330 --> 03:43:29.340 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:43:31.490 --> 03:43:31.500 align:start position:0%
any further questions from the committee
 
03:43:33.410 --> 03:43:33.420 align:start position:0%
members representative tolerski thank
 
03:43:34.729 --> 03:43:34.739 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman thank you for taking my
 
03:43:36.710 --> 03:43:36.720 align:start position:0%
question again this is also relatively
 
03:43:39.170 --> 03:43:39.180 align:start position:0%
new to me before sitting in at the child
 
03:43:41.269 --> 03:43:41.279 align:start position:0%
and family law hearing earlier this week
 
03:43:43.729 --> 03:43:43.739 align:start position:0%
but um
 
03:43:46.190 --> 03:43:46.200 align:start position:0%
what I do know or what I believe I know
 
03:43:49.250 --> 03:43:49.260 align:start position:0%
is it that a location for the new center
 
03:43:52.790 --> 03:43:52.800 align:start position:0%
isn't finalized is that correct
 
03:43:55.309 --> 03:43:55.319 align:start position:0%
there's two answers to that okay
 
03:43:58.790 --> 03:43:58.800 align:start position:0%
the technical answer is that no the site
 
03:44:02.269 --> 03:44:02.279 align:start position:0%
has not been selected yet that the
 
03:44:04.910 --> 03:44:04.920 align:start position:0%
department has identified three possible
 
03:44:08.870 --> 03:44:08.880 align:start position:0%
locations uh and that once the spill
 
03:44:12.290 --> 03:44:12.300 align:start position:0%
gets passed uh the the formal process of
 
03:44:14.389 --> 03:44:14.399 align:start position:0%
site evaluation and talking to the
 
03:44:17.150 --> 03:44:17.160 align:start position:0%
communities and all of that stuff will
 
03:44:19.550 --> 03:44:19.560 align:start position:0%
happen that's that's the technical
 
03:44:21.110 --> 03:44:21.120 align:start position:0%
official answer
 
03:44:24.830 --> 03:44:24.840 align:start position:0%
the I think the reality is is that
 
03:44:27.950 --> 03:44:27.960 align:start position:0%
there's an extremely high bias towards
 
03:44:30.710 --> 03:44:30.720 align:start position:0%
co-location of this with the Hampstead
 
03:44:33.650 --> 03:44:33.660 align:start position:0%
Hospital so that we could potentially
 
03:44:38.030 --> 03:44:38.040 align:start position:0%
through that co-location Leverage
 
03:44:41.269 --> 03:44:41.279 align:start position:0%
um some of the staff at that facility
 
03:44:44.630 --> 03:44:44.640 align:start position:0%
that's trained in managing mental and
 
03:44:47.950 --> 03:44:47.960 align:start position:0%
Behavioral Health aspects of juveniles
 
03:44:50.570 --> 03:44:50.580 align:start position:0%
so we get some leveraging of a
 
03:44:52.849 --> 03:44:52.859 align:start position:0%
critically short resource which is the
 
03:44:55.190 --> 03:44:55.200 align:start position:0%
the Manpower that's specialized in this
 
03:44:57.610 --> 03:44:57.620 align:start position:0%
area and that we could get some other
 
03:45:02.510 --> 03:45:02.520 align:start position:0%
advantages of co-location so so the
 
03:45:04.490 --> 03:45:04.500 align:start position:0%
official answer is there are three sites
 
03:45:06.650 --> 03:45:06.660 align:start position:0%
that will be evaluated
 
03:45:10.130 --> 03:45:10.140 align:start position:0%
to be honest with you is I I think I I
 
03:45:12.530 --> 03:45:12.540 align:start position:0%
think the bias and the momentum is
 
03:45:15.650 --> 03:45:15.660 align:start position:0%
really heavily aimed at Hampstead and in
 
03:45:17.990 --> 03:45:18.000 align:start position:0%
order to get the support of the
 
03:45:21.250 --> 03:45:21.260 align:start position:0%
Hampstead senators and representatives
 
03:45:23.809 --> 03:45:23.819 align:start position:0%
uh one of the Amendments that got
 
03:45:25.849 --> 03:45:25.859 align:start position:0%
approved today said that they're going
 
03:45:29.269 --> 03:45:29.279 align:start position:0%
to do this commission to to uh to make
 
03:45:31.250 --> 03:45:31.260 align:start position:0%
sure that the community gets coordinated
 
03:45:34.190 --> 03:45:34.200 align:start position:0%
with and that you know that there's an
 
03:45:36.410 --> 03:45:36.420 align:start position:0%
appropriate amount of money that's going
 
03:45:38.690 --> 03:45:38.700 align:start position:0%
to be transferred to compensate for the
 
03:45:41.570 --> 03:45:41.580 align:start position:0%
lost property value and to compensate
 
03:45:45.490 --> 03:45:45.500 align:start position:0%
for extra fire and law enforcement
 
03:45:48.410 --> 03:45:48.420 align:start position:0%
so so the the bill that you're going to
 
03:45:50.570 --> 03:45:50.580 align:start position:0%
see that you did not see in children and
 
03:45:53.330 --> 03:45:53.340 align:start position:0%
family law because it's it's got amended
 
03:45:55.490 --> 03:45:55.500 align:start position:0%
by the Senate has some additional
 
03:45:59.030 --> 03:45:59.040 align:start position:0%
Provisions to ensure that the local
 
03:46:01.370 --> 03:46:01.380 align:start position:0%
representation at Hampstead are happy
 
03:46:03.710 --> 03:46:03.720 align:start position:0%
and the only reason they did that is
 
03:46:07.010 --> 03:46:07.020 align:start position:0%
because everyone sort of knows the Open
 
03:46:08.929 --> 03:46:08.939 align:start position:0%
Secret that this will probably go to
 
03:46:11.030 --> 03:46:11.040 align:start position:0%
Hampstead does that answer your question
 
03:46:12.950 --> 03:46:12.960 align:start position:0%
if I can have one little follow-up thank
 
03:46:12.960 --> 03:46:13.910 align:start position:0%
if I can have one little follow-up thank
you

03:46:13.910 --> 03:46:13.920 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:46:15.830 --> 03:46:15.840 align:start position:0%
well I understand all that and I
 
03:46:19.670 --> 03:46:19.680 align:start position:0%
appreciate the answer I guess what
 
03:46:21.710 --> 03:46:21.720 align:start position:0%
question comes to me is
 
03:46:24.650 --> 03:46:24.660 align:start position:0%
what would be the normal process
 
03:46:26.870 --> 03:46:26.880 align:start position:0%
to determine a location for something
 
03:46:28.849 --> 03:46:28.859 align:start position:0%
this significant
 
03:46:28.859 --> 03:46:29.630 align:start position:0%
this significant
um

03:46:29.630 --> 03:46:29.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:46:34.010 --> 03:46:34.020 align:start position:0%
and are we jumping over that process
 
03:46:34.020 --> 03:46:35.389 align:start position:0%
and are we jumping over that process
by

03:46:35.389 --> 03:46:35.399 align:start position:0%
by
 
03:46:37.250 --> 03:46:37.260 align:start position:0%
for either the communities that may be
 
03:46:37.260 --> 03:46:38.809 align:start position:0%
for either the communities that may be
affected

03:46:38.809 --> 03:46:38.819 align:start position:0%
affected
 
03:46:38.819 --> 03:46:39.710 align:start position:0%
affected
um

03:46:39.710 --> 03:46:39.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:46:42.050 --> 03:46:42.060 align:start position:0%
or any of us who are decision makers or
 
03:46:44.750 --> 03:46:44.760 align:start position:0%
are we jumping over a normal process
 
03:46:47.389 --> 03:46:47.399 align:start position:0%
by pushing through I haven't seen the
 
03:46:49.250 --> 03:46:49.260 align:start position:0%
Senate bill so I'm just yeah I feel
 
03:46:50.570 --> 03:46:50.580 align:start position:0%
funny commenting on a bill that's not in
 
03:46:52.550 --> 03:46:52.560 align:start position:0%
front of me I apologize but right I mean
 
03:46:56.210 --> 03:46:56.220 align:start position:0%
the bill doesn't talk about uh the site
 
03:47:00.229 --> 03:47:00.239 align:start position:0%
it talks about when there's a site here
 
03:47:03.429 --> 03:47:03.439 align:start position:0%
the requirements that we won we're not
 
03:47:07.550 --> 03:47:07.560 align:start position:0%
prejudging site location and and But to
 
03:47:09.650 --> 03:47:09.660 align:start position:0%
answer your specific question are are we
 
03:47:14.030 --> 03:47:14.040 align:start position:0%
are we jumping over process yeah
 
03:47:16.550 --> 03:47:16.560 align:start position:0%
and and and I think part of it's our own
 
03:47:18.469 --> 03:47:18.479 align:start position:0%
fault we were supposed to pass this bill
 
03:47:21.889 --> 03:47:21.899 align:start position:0%
back in June uh and we have this one
 
03:47:26.870 --> 03:47:26.880 align:start position:0%
March deadline and so uh I uh respect
 
03:47:28.790 --> 03:47:28.800 align:start position:0%
the fact that the commissioner and the
 
03:47:31.670 --> 03:47:31.680 align:start position:0%
director have continued to do a very
 
03:47:34.130 --> 03:47:34.140 align:start position:0%
thoughtful examination of the
 
03:47:37.130 --> 03:47:37.140 align:start position:0%
possibilities in anticipation that
 
03:47:38.389 --> 03:47:38.399 align:start position:0%
something like the committee a
 
03:47:39.889 --> 03:47:39.899 align:start position:0%
conference agreement was going to get
 
03:47:43.010 --> 03:47:43.020 align:start position:0%
passed so they've been doing homework in
 
03:47:45.590 --> 03:47:45.600 align:start position:0%
advanced it's just at a standing around
 
03:47:48.110 --> 03:47:48.120 align:start position:0%
doing nothing right so they've got some
 
03:47:50.510 --> 03:47:50.520 align:start position:0%
initial momentum and the directors here
 
03:47:53.330 --> 03:47:53.340 align:start position:0%
he can speak to some of this but but I I
 
03:47:56.510 --> 03:47:56.520 align:start position:0%
basically applaud it now now one thing I
 
03:47:58.550 --> 03:47:58.560 align:start position:0%
I have done and what some of the
 
03:48:01.929 --> 03:48:01.939 align:start position:0%
Senators have wanted to do was to
 
03:48:05.570 --> 03:48:05.580 align:start position:0%
encourage the commissioner and others to
 
03:48:08.870 --> 03:48:08.880 align:start position:0%
go ahead and to begin reaching out to
 
03:48:10.910 --> 03:48:10.920 align:start position:0%
communicate with the potentially
 
03:48:13.969 --> 03:48:13.979 align:start position:0%
affected communities because the insert
 
03:48:16.729 --> 03:48:16.739 align:start position:0%
and he was causing dysfunction you know
 
03:48:18.190 --> 03:48:18.200 align:start position:0%
when people don't know what's going on
 
03:48:21.650 --> 03:48:21.660 align:start position:0%
rumors start you know
 
03:48:25.969 --> 03:48:25.979 align:start position:0%
false allegations arise so so I so we've
 
03:48:27.889 --> 03:48:27.899 align:start position:0%
been encouraging the uh the department
 
03:48:31.070 --> 03:48:31.080 align:start position:0%
to begin Communications but I think they
 
03:48:33.950 --> 03:48:33.960 align:start position:0%
kept their powder dry until they
 
03:48:36.050 --> 03:48:36.060 align:start position:0%
actually know what the legislature and
 
03:48:40.010 --> 03:48:40.020 align:start position:0%
Governor wants them to do so
 
03:48:42.530 --> 03:48:42.540 align:start position:0%
yes ma'am
 
03:48:44.389 --> 03:48:44.399 align:start position:0%
any further questions from committee
 
03:48:46.550 --> 03:48:46.560 align:start position:0%
members seeing none thank you for your
 
03:48:46.560 --> 03:48:47.990 align:start position:0%
members seeing none thank you for your
testimony

03:48:47.990 --> 03:48:48.000 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
03:49:01.969 --> 03:49:01.979 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:03.830 --> 03:49:03.840 align:start position:0%
good afternoon
 
03:49:06.469 --> 03:49:06.479 align:start position:0%
Joe ripsom director dcyf happy to see
 
03:49:08.150 --> 03:49:08.160 align:start position:0%
everybody today
 
03:49:11.210 --> 03:49:11.220 align:start position:0%
um I would uh be happy to take folks
 
03:49:13.610 --> 03:49:13.620 align:start position:0%
questions uh agree with what
 
03:49:15.469 --> 03:49:15.479 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards said in terms of
 
03:49:17.150 --> 03:49:17.160 align:start position:0%
you know there are a couple moving parts
 
03:49:18.950 --> 03:49:18.960 align:start position:0%
to this there is the idea around trying
 
03:49:20.090 --> 03:49:20.100 align:start position:0%
to move a substantive piece of
 
03:49:22.370 --> 03:49:22.380 align:start position:0%
legislation very quickly I think you
 
03:49:23.809 --> 03:49:23.819 align:start position:0%
would describe this as kind of the belt
 
03:49:25.610 --> 03:49:25.620 align:start position:0%
and suspenders approach of kind of the
 
03:49:28.429 --> 03:49:28.439 align:start position:0%
you know what do we do just in case the
 
03:49:30.650 --> 03:49:30.660 align:start position:0%
Senate did today move the substantive
 
03:49:33.530 --> 03:49:33.540 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation sb1 through final
 
03:49:36.050 --> 03:49:36.060 align:start position:0%
passage unanimously so I'd expect
 
03:49:38.750 --> 03:49:38.760 align:start position:0%
crossover to you know occur promptly and
 
03:49:40.370 --> 03:49:40.380 align:start position:0%
to have that bill over here in the house
 
03:49:42.590 --> 03:49:42.600 align:start position:0%
child and family law is the division
 
03:49:44.510 --> 03:49:44.520 align:start position:0%
three members now anyway
 
03:49:46.790 --> 03:49:46.800 align:start position:0%
started hearing hb120 which is
 
03:49:49.070 --> 03:49:49.080 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards version of a
 
03:49:51.309 --> 03:49:51.319 align:start position:0%
similar Bill last week
 
03:49:55.550 --> 03:49:55.560 align:start position:0%
those bills do need to pass by the end
 
03:49:57.650 --> 03:49:57.660 align:start position:0%
of February lest we find ourselves in a
 
03:50:00.590 --> 03:50:00.600 align:start position:0%
situation where sysc closes without an
 
03:50:02.389 --> 03:50:02.399 align:start position:0%
alternative for the young folks who are
 
03:50:03.889 --> 03:50:03.899 align:start position:0%
currently committed and detained there
 
03:50:06.050 --> 03:50:06.060 align:start position:0%
and New Hampshire will continue to have
 
03:50:07.790 --> 03:50:07.800 align:start position:0%
laws on the books requiring the
 
03:50:09.229 --> 03:50:09.239 align:start position:0%
detention and commitment of kids but
 
03:50:12.889 --> 03:50:12.899 align:start position:0%
will have no place to legally detain or
 
03:50:15.710 --> 03:50:15.720 align:start position:0%
commit kids on that date
 
03:50:15.720 --> 03:50:16.610 align:start position:0%
commit kids on that date
um

03:50:16.610 --> 03:50:16.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:50:19.130 --> 03:50:19.140 align:start position:0%
so with that you know we do support to
 
03:50:20.929 --> 03:50:20.939 align:start position:0%
bill the bill to the extent that it
 
03:50:23.150 --> 03:50:23.160 align:start position:0%
becomes necessary we will defer to all
 
03:50:25.130 --> 03:50:25.140 align:start position:0%
of you in terms of strategy and tactics
 
03:50:28.309 --> 03:50:28.319 align:start position:0%
on how and when to move that bill or not
 
03:50:30.410 --> 03:50:30.420 align:start position:0%
move that bill in terms of you know
 
03:50:32.269 --> 03:50:32.279 align:start position:0%
sequencing and I'll be happy to take
 
03:50:35.150 --> 03:50:35.160 align:start position:0%
questions that anybody has
 
03:50:36.830 --> 03:50:36.840 align:start position:0%
thank you director any questions from
 
03:50:40.190 --> 03:50:40.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:44.990 --> 03:50:45.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:48.050 --> 03:50:48.060 align:start position:0%
I have a card for Mac Mark Cavanaugh
 
03:50:49.849 --> 03:50:49.859 align:start position:0%
associate Council
 
03:51:00.170 --> 03:51:00.180 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:03.290 --> 03:51:03.300 align:start position:0%
Oh wrong Bill wrong bill
 
03:51:05.210 --> 03:51:05.220 align:start position:0%
somehow it got put on top of the other
 
03:51:06.769 --> 03:51:06.779 align:start position:0%
one all right do I have any more for
 
03:51:09.349 --> 03:51:09.359 align:start position:0%
House Bill 49 it does not appear that I
 
03:51:09.359 --> 03:51:12.349 align:start position:0%
House Bill 49 it does not appear that I
do

03:51:12.349 --> 03:51:12.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:12.359 --> 03:51:14.210 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:51:14.210 --> 03:51:14.220 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:51:19.849 --> 03:51:19.859 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:25.070 --> 03:51:25.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:32.809 --> 03:51:32.819 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:38.269 --> 03:51:38.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:40.010 --> 03:51:40.020 align:start position:0%
so we will
 
03:51:44.450 --> 03:51:44.460 align:start position:0%
close the hearing on House Bill 49 and
 
03:51:48.410 --> 03:51:48.420 align:start position:0%
it will be going to division three
 
03:51:49.729 --> 03:51:49.739 align:start position:0%
and I don't believe they have a
 
03:51:51.590 --> 03:51:51.600 align:start position:0%
scheduled hearing on it yet probably
 
03:51:53.630 --> 03:51:53.640 align:start position:0%
waiting for that other one that's we're
 
03:51:56.269 --> 03:51:56.279 align:start position:0%
waiting to come through so
 
03:51:58.370 --> 03:51:58.380 align:start position:0%
I hope we all realize the importance of
 
03:52:00.410 --> 03:52:00.420 align:start position:0%
this something needs to be done quickly
 
03:52:02.990 --> 03:52:03.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for pointing that out
 
03:52:06.469 --> 03:52:06.479 align:start position:0%
hearing is closed and we have a few more
 
03:52:09.110 --> 03:52:09.120 align:start position:0%
minutes till our two o'clock and we'll
 
03:52:12.229 --> 03:52:12.239 align:start position:0%
start that on House Bill 50. so anybody
 
03:52:14.990 --> 03:52:15.000 align:start position:0%
I have some cards already on House Bill
 
03:52:20.269 --> 03:52:20.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:20.279 --> 04:01:53.689 align:start position:0%
 
business

04:01:53.689 --> 04:01:53.699 align:start position:0%

for the record my name is Mike Edgar I'm
 
04:02:25.250 --> 04:02:25.260 align:start position:0%
a representative from Hampton
 
04:02:28.070 --> 04:02:28.080 align:start position:0%

committee members for allowing me to
introduce

04:02:31.309 --> 04:02:31.319 align:start position:0%
introduce
 
04:02:35.389 --> 04:02:35.399 align:start position:0%
uh hb50 today this bill is relative to
 
04:02:37.670 --> 04:02:37.680 align:start position:0%
payment of state of a portion of the
 
04:02:39.349 --> 04:02:39.359 align:start position:0%
retirement system contribution of
 
04:02:41.990 --> 04:02:42.000 align:start position:0%
political subdivisions
 
04:02:44.809 --> 04:02:44.819 align:start position:0%
more plainly this bill requires a state
 
04:02:46.610 --> 04:02:46.620 align:start position:0%
to pay seven and a half percent of
 
04:02:48.830 --> 04:02:48.840 align:start position:0%
political subdivision employer pension
 
04:02:50.929 --> 04:02:50.939 align:start position:0%
pension contributions on behalf of
 
04:02:54.830 --> 04:02:54.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:56.570 --> 04:02:56.580 align:start position:0%
many of you know
 
04:02:58.790 --> 04:02:58.800 align:start position:0%
the history of the state reneging on its
 
04:03:00.349 --> 04:03:00.359 align:start position:0%
promise to fund a portion of the
 
04:03:02.150 --> 04:03:02.160 align:start position:0%
retirement program
 
04:03:04.490 --> 04:03:04.500 align:start position:0%
Others May testify in more detail on the
 
04:03:07.610 --> 04:03:07.620 align:start position:0%
history but a few of the low points are
 
04:03:07.620 --> 04:03:09.370 align:start position:0%
history but a few of the low points are
in

04:03:09.370 --> 04:03:09.380 align:start position:0%
in
 
04:03:12.050 --> 04:03:12.060 align:start position:0%
1967 the state encouraged political
 
04:03:13.910 --> 04:03:13.920 align:start position:0%
subdivisions to join a Statewide
 
04:03:16.849 --> 04:03:16.859 align:start position:0%
retirement system for teachers police
 
04:03:19.189 --> 04:03:19.199 align:start position:0%
and firefighters instead it would
 
04:03:22.030 --> 04:03:22.040 align:start position:0%
contribute 40 percent
 
04:03:25.670 --> 04:03:25.680 align:start position:0%
in 1977 State reduced its contribution
 
04:03:28.510 --> 04:03:28.520 align:start position:0%
to 35 percent
 
04:03:32.590 --> 04:03:32.600 align:start position:0%
2009 it was a busy year with different
 
04:03:35.809 --> 04:03:35.819 align:start position:0%
amendments and things but uh it was
 
04:03:38.269 --> 04:03:38.279 align:start position:0%
first was to reduce the share to 30 in
 
04:03:40.729 --> 04:03:40.739 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 2010
 
04:03:43.130 --> 04:03:43.140 align:start position:0%
then an amendment to reduce the state
 
04:03:48.349 --> 04:03:48.359 align:start position:0%
share to 25 and physically uh 2011.
 
04:03:50.929 --> 04:03:50.939 align:start position:0%
and then later uh in 2009 the amendment
 
04:03:52.969 --> 04:03:52.979 align:start position:0%
to restore the state contribution to 35
 
04:03:55.750 --> 04:03:55.760 align:start position:0%
percent in physical year
 
04:03:55.760 --> 04:03:57.650 align:start position:0%
percent in physical year
2012.

04:03:57.650 --> 04:03:57.660 align:start position:0%
2012.
 
04:04:00.469 --> 04:04:00.479 align:start position:0%
but in 2011 amendment to completely
 
04:04:03.110 --> 04:04:03.120 align:start position:0%
eliminate the state contribution
 
04:04:05.630 --> 04:04:05.640 align:start position:0%
was done and yes it actually went down
 
04:04:06.710 --> 04:04:06.720 align:start position:0%
to zero
 
04:04:06.720 --> 04:04:08.210 align:start position:0%
to zero
so

04:04:08.210 --> 04:04:08.220 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:04:11.830 --> 04:04:11.840 align:start position:0%
um last year in 2022
 
04:04:14.689 --> 04:04:14.699 align:start position:0%
Renny Cushing submitted a bill similar
 
04:04:16.910 --> 04:04:16.920 align:start position:0%
to ones he had submitted in the past
 
04:04:18.950 --> 04:04:18.960 align:start position:0%
and this time it was for seven and a
 
04:04:22.790 --> 04:04:22.800 align:start position:0%
half percent to restore to be restored
 
04:04:25.070 --> 04:04:25.080 align:start position:0%
it this actually passed in the house but
 
04:04:26.269 --> 04:04:26.279 align:start position:0%
the Senate
 
04:04:27.950 --> 04:04:27.960 align:start position:0%
changed it
 
04:04:32.090 --> 04:04:32.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:35.870 --> 04:04:35.880 align:start position:0%
um I want to mention that in in 2022
 
04:04:39.189 --> 04:04:39.199 align:start position:0%
last year uh the bill did pass the house
 
04:04:42.229 --> 04:04:42.239 align:start position:0%
and it was only by bipartisan support
 
04:04:46.010 --> 04:04:46.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:48.410 --> 04:04:48.420 align:start position:0%
again towns cities and schools are asked
 
04:04:50.750 --> 04:04:50.760 align:start position:0%
to join the state retirement system with
 
04:04:52.550 --> 04:04:52.560 align:start position:0%
promise that the state would help defray
 
04:04:54.650 --> 04:04:54.660 align:start position:0%
the employer costs
 
04:04:56.750 --> 04:04:56.760 align:start position:0%
when New Hampshire retirement system was
 
04:05:00.950 --> 04:05:00.960 align:start position:0%
formed in 1967 replacing four smaller
 
04:05:02.929 --> 04:05:02.939 align:start position:0%
separate Retirement Systems the state
 
04:05:04.910 --> 04:05:04.920 align:start position:0%
contributed 40 percent of the total
 
04:05:07.610 --> 04:05:07.620 align:start position:0%
employer costs
 
04:05:09.170 --> 04:05:09.180 align:start position:0%
the seven and a half percent that we
 
04:05:11.389 --> 04:05:11.399 align:start position:0%
have now is only for one year and then
 
04:05:14.150 --> 04:05:14.160 align:start position:0%
it reverts back to zero
 
04:05:16.130 --> 04:05:16.140 align:start position:0%
since the state reneged on its promise
 
04:05:17.929 --> 04:05:17.939 align:start position:0%
the political subdivisions have had to
 
04:05:20.030 --> 04:05:20.040 align:start position:0%
pay for the state's share of the
 
04:05:22.610 --> 04:05:22.620 align:start position:0%
employer costs much of which have been
 
04:05:25.010 --> 04:05:25.020 align:start position:0%
downshifted the municipal and local
 
04:05:27.530 --> 04:05:27.540 align:start position:0%
school property tax rates
 
04:05:30.229 --> 04:05:30.239 align:start position:0%
please consider voting
 
04:05:32.929 --> 04:05:32.939 align:start position:0%
OTP on HP 50
 
04:05:35.510 --> 04:05:35.520 align:start position:0%
to partially reinstate the promise of
 
04:05:37.910 --> 04:05:37.920 align:start position:0%
the state to political subdivisions
 
04:05:40.309 --> 04:05:40.319 align:start position:0%
it would provide much needed relief to
 
04:05:42.290 --> 04:05:42.300 align:start position:0%
political subdivisions and help offset
 
04:05:46.010 --> 04:05:46.020 align:start position:0%
the need for increased property taxes
 
04:05:48.769 --> 04:05:48.779 align:start position:0%
fb50 helps the average taxpayer in New
 
04:05:48.779 --> 04:05:50.750 align:start position:0%
fb50 helps the average taxpayer in New
Hampshire

04:05:50.750 --> 04:05:50.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
04:05:52.309 --> 04:05:52.319 align:start position:0%
again thanks for giving me this
 
04:05:54.590 --> 04:05:54.600 align:start position:0%
opportunity and I
 
04:05:57.650 --> 04:05:57.660 align:start position:0%
assume there's gonna be some questions
 
04:05:59.689 --> 04:05:59.699 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony uh
 
04:06:02.990 --> 04:06:03.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:05.689 --> 04:06:05.699 align:start position:0%
representative Heath thank you Mr chair
 
04:06:07.910 --> 04:06:07.920 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question
 
04:06:10.969 --> 04:06:10.979 align:start position:0%
in my city of Manchester
 
04:06:13.130 --> 04:06:13.140 align:start position:0%
um those funds
 
04:06:16.429 --> 04:06:16.439 align:start position:0%
um were very welcome and allowed us to
 
04:06:20.689 --> 04:06:20.699 align:start position:0%
directly look at our our property tax
 
04:06:24.830 --> 04:06:24.840 align:start position:0%
base do you agree with the fact that the
 
04:06:28.550 --> 04:06:28.560 align:start position:0%
best way that the state can help towns
 
04:06:30.950 --> 04:06:30.960 align:start position:0%
and municipalities to reduce their
 
04:06:33.769 --> 04:06:33.779 align:start position:0%
property taxes is to in fact pass this
 
04:06:33.779 --> 04:06:37.010 align:start position:0%
property taxes is to in fact pass this
bill

04:06:37.010 --> 04:06:37.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:37.020 --> 04:06:38.570 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:06:38.570 --> 04:06:38.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:06:40.610 --> 04:06:40.620 align:start position:0%
I'd like to say yes
 
04:06:42.410 --> 04:06:42.420 align:start position:0%
but I preface it to say there's a lot of
 
04:06:43.969 --> 04:06:43.979 align:start position:0%
things that he could do to to help
 
04:06:45.889 --> 04:06:45.899 align:start position:0%
property taxes but not downshifting
 
04:06:48.410 --> 04:06:48.420 align:start position:0%
different things but this this is a very
 
04:06:51.170 --> 04:06:51.180 align:start position:0%
to me is a very significant
 
04:06:53.870 --> 04:06:53.880 align:start position:0%
um amount in issue and
 
04:06:56.090 --> 04:06:56.100 align:start position:0%
I guess you could say that if they get
 
04:07:02.389 --> 04:07:02.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:02.399 --> 04:07:06.830 align:start position:0%
 
questions

04:07:06.830 --> 04:07:06.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:09.050 --> 04:07:09.060 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire
 
04:07:10.849 --> 04:07:10.859 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
04:07:12.889 --> 04:07:12.899 align:start position:0%
taking my question is there anything in
 
04:07:16.630 --> 04:07:16.640 align:start position:0%
the bill that requires municipalities to
 
04:07:19.729 --> 04:07:19.739 align:start position:0%
apply these particular funds to lowering
 
04:07:21.710 --> 04:07:21.720 align:start position:0%
property tax as opposed to other
 
04:07:21.720 --> 04:07:23.630 align:start position:0%
property tax as opposed to other
expenditures

04:07:23.630 --> 04:07:23.640 align:start position:0%
expenditures
 
04:07:25.490 --> 04:07:25.500 align:start position:0%
there's nothing specifically in the bill
 
04:07:27.349 --> 04:07:27.359 align:start position:0%
that would direct that it's kind of
 
04:07:28.670 --> 04:07:28.680 align:start position:0%
unusual to direct
 
04:07:31.189 --> 04:07:31.199 align:start position:0%
how things are going to be done that way
 
04:07:31.199 --> 04:07:32.269 align:start position:0%
how things are going to be done that way
um

04:07:32.269 --> 04:07:32.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:07:34.610 --> 04:07:34.620 align:start position:0%
I just know that the experience that I
 
04:07:36.950 --> 04:07:36.960 align:start position:0%
would have is is it it would really help
 
04:07:39.110 --> 04:07:39.120 align:start position:0%
with providing the services that you
 
04:07:41.269 --> 04:07:41.279 align:start position:0%
want to that hopefully wouldn't increase
 
04:07:44.990 --> 04:07:45.000 align:start position:0%
your tax rate and it maybe if if you're
 
04:07:46.429 --> 04:07:46.439 align:start position:0%
fortunate enough especially if you're up
 
04:07:49.290 --> 04:07:49.300 align:start position:0%
to 40 we'll probably decrease it
 
04:07:49.300 --> 04:07:51.410 align:start position:0%
to 40 we'll probably decrease it

reinstatement of the state retirement
 
04:08:34.309 --> 04:08:34.319 align:start position:0%
contribution I won't repeat any of the
 
04:08:35.929 --> 04:08:35.939 align:start position:0%
history that you just heard and many of
 
04:08:37.429 --> 04:08:37.439 align:start position:0%
you are probably familiar with that
 
04:08:40.849 --> 04:08:40.859 align:start position:0%
history I will say that last year the
 
04:08:42.950 --> 04:08:42.960 align:start position:0%
bill that passed for the one-time
 
04:08:45.469 --> 04:08:45.479 align:start position:0%
payment using State Surplus of seven and
 
04:08:48.469 --> 04:08:48.479 align:start position:0%
a half percent which gave 26.7 million
 
04:08:50.990 --> 04:08:51.000 align:start position:0%
dollars back to municipalities in that
 
04:08:52.809 --> 04:08:52.819 align:start position:0%
case those funds were applied on the
 
04:08:55.790 --> 04:08:55.800 align:start position:0%
ms-434 and reported as Revenue therefore
 
04:08:58.550 --> 04:08:58.560 align:start position:0%
decreasing taxation so for example Amer
 
04:09:01.790 --> 04:09:01.800 align:start position:0%
School District received 174 thousand
 
04:09:01.800 --> 04:09:02.689 align:start position:0%
School District received 174 thousand
dollars

04:09:02.689 --> 04:09:02.699 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
04:09:05.210 --> 04:09:05.220 align:start position:0%
or their taxpayers received that
 
04:09:07.309 --> 04:09:07.319 align:start position:0%
reduction if that was because it was
 
04:09:10.189 --> 04:09:10.199 align:start position:0%
reported as revenue for one example on
 
04:09:11.870 --> 04:09:11.880 align:start position:0%
the town of Hampton
 
04:09:14.570 --> 04:09:14.580 align:start position:0%
I believe received
 
04:09:18.830 --> 04:09:18.840 align:start position:0%
164 000 according to nhrs data the town
 
04:09:21.050 --> 04:09:21.060 align:start position:0%
of Guilford received sixty thousand so
 
04:09:23.870 --> 04:09:23.880 align:start position:0%
that did go to reducing the tax burden
 
04:09:26.330 --> 04:09:26.340 align:start position:0%
by accounting it as Revenue this bill
 
04:09:28.309 --> 04:09:28.319 align:start position:0%
however does not direct those funds to
 
04:09:30.530 --> 04:09:30.540 align:start position:0%
answer your question in that way it
 
04:09:32.750 --> 04:09:32.760 align:start position:0%
would reduce what the budgeted amount
 
04:09:34.969 --> 04:09:34.979 align:start position:0%
has to be for the municipality in this
 
04:09:36.950 --> 04:09:36.960 align:start position:0%
case because it's not a reimbursement so
 
04:09:39.650 --> 04:09:39.660 align:start position:0%
they would only budget 92 percent of
 
04:09:41.929 --> 04:09:41.939 align:start position:0%
what they're currently budgeting so it
 
04:09:43.969 --> 04:09:43.979 align:start position:0%
would come right out of the what needed
 
04:09:45.830 --> 04:09:45.840 align:start position:0%
to be raised and appropriate so I do
 
04:09:48.110 --> 04:09:48.120 align:start position:0%
believe it would reduce taxation because
 
04:09:49.910 --> 04:09:49.920 align:start position:0%
if funds would not be having to be
 
04:09:52.490 --> 04:09:52.500 align:start position:0%
raised and appropriated at the hundred
 
04:09:54.170 --> 04:09:54.180 align:start position:0%
percent level should this legislation
 
04:09:54.180 --> 04:09:55.250 align:start position:0%
percent level should this legislation
pass

04:09:55.250 --> 04:09:55.260 align:start position:0%
pass
 
04:09:58.189 --> 04:09:58.199 align:start position:0%
so I'm happy to take any questions
 
04:10:00.469 --> 04:10:00.479 align:start position:0%
uh thank you questions from the
 
04:10:00.479 --> 04:10:01.849 align:start position:0%
uh thank you questions from the
committee

04:10:01.849 --> 04:10:01.859 align:start position:0%
committee
 
04:10:01.859 --> 04:10:03.050 align:start position:0%
committee
Mr

04:10:03.050 --> 04:10:03.060 align:start position:0%
Mr
 
04:10:04.910 --> 04:10:04.920 align:start position:0%
papavichi Muller
 
04:10:07.429 --> 04:10:07.439 align:start position:0%
thank you Vice chairman and thank you
 
04:10:10.309 --> 04:10:10.319 align:start position:0%
for taking my question you said that
 
04:10:13.250 --> 04:10:13.260 align:start position:0%
um you know the town has received 26.2
 
04:10:15.830 --> 04:10:15.840 align:start position:0%
million in revenue and that led to tax
 
04:10:18.410 --> 04:10:18.420 align:start position:0%
reductions but that would only be the
 
04:10:21.170 --> 04:10:21.180 align:start position:0%
case if no new expenditures were made in
 
04:10:22.849 --> 04:10:22.859 align:start position:0%
light of that new Revenue do you have
 
04:10:25.849 --> 04:10:25.859 align:start position:0%
any data to support uh you know that the
 
04:10:28.010 --> 04:10:28.020 align:start position:0%
towns just took the savings and applied
 
04:10:29.630 --> 04:10:29.640 align:start position:0%
it to the property or is it an
 
04:10:29.640 --> 04:10:30.590 align:start position:0%
it to the property or is it an
assumption

04:10:30.590 --> 04:10:30.600 align:start position:0%
assumption
 
04:10:30.600 --> 04:10:31.790 align:start position:0%
assumption
so

04:10:31.790 --> 04:10:31.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:10:34.130 --> 04:10:34.140 align:start position:0%
these were unanticipated funds they had
 
04:10:37.610 --> 04:10:37.620 align:start position:0%
to be accepted under law under RSA 3195
 
04:10:39.950 --> 04:10:39.960 align:start position:0%
B so they wouldn't have been budgeted
 
04:10:39.960 --> 04:10:40.790 align:start position:0%
B so they wouldn't have been budgeted
for

04:10:40.790 --> 04:10:40.800 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:10:43.550 --> 04:10:43.560 align:start position:0%
so when we create our town budgets we
 
04:10:45.229 --> 04:10:45.239 align:start position:0%
have the appropriation side so what
 
04:10:47.809 --> 04:10:47.819 align:start position:0%
you've chosen to allow the town to spend
 
04:10:51.410 --> 04:10:51.420 align:start position:0%
and then we have the revenue side so we
 
04:10:53.570 --> 04:10:53.580 align:start position:0%
had to budget 100 percent of the cost
 
04:10:56.030 --> 04:10:56.040 align:start position:0%
and tax people on a hundred percent of
 
04:10:58.130 --> 04:10:58.140 align:start position:0%
the cost so when we receive these
 
04:11:00.170 --> 04:11:00.180 align:start position:0%
payments and we reported them as Revenue
 
04:11:02.030 --> 04:11:02.040 align:start position:0%
that we did not anticipate it
 
04:11:03.950 --> 04:11:03.960 align:start position:0%
automatically came off the top before
 
04:11:06.349 --> 04:11:06.359 align:start position:0%
the taxes were redistributed so
 
04:11:10.250 --> 04:11:10.260 align:start position:0%
therefore it would reduce taxation quick
 
04:11:12.050 --> 04:11:12.060 align:start position:0%
quick follow-up
 
04:11:14.450 --> 04:11:14.460 align:start position:0%
follow up thank you
 
04:11:16.550 --> 04:11:16.560 align:start position:0%
thank you for describing the processes
 
04:11:18.830 --> 04:11:18.840 align:start position:0%
or the former Finance director for the
 
04:11:21.290 --> 04:11:21.300 align:start position:0%
town of Windham I'm deeply familiar with
 
04:11:23.510 --> 04:11:23.520 align:start position:0%
that and everything you said is accurate
 
04:11:28.130 --> 04:11:28.140 align:start position:0%
but it is also you know known that towns
 
04:11:31.130 --> 04:11:31.140 align:start position:0%
have opportunity to decide towards the
 
04:11:32.269 --> 04:11:32.279 align:start position:0%
end of the year whether to spend
 
04:11:34.910 --> 04:11:34.920 align:start position:0%
appropriated money or not depending on
 
04:11:36.769 --> 04:11:36.779 align:start position:0%
how much money is left in the budget and
 
04:11:38.630 --> 04:11:38.640 align:start position:0%
obviously new revenues coming in change
 
04:11:40.969 --> 04:11:40.979 align:start position:0%
that equation this is the you know
 
04:11:42.769 --> 04:11:42.779 align:start position:0%
question that I was asking whether you
 
04:11:45.170 --> 04:11:45.180 align:start position:0%
you know asked or studied that or you
 
04:11:46.729 --> 04:11:46.739 align:start position:0%
know is it just an assumption that
 
04:11:48.170 --> 04:11:48.180 align:start position:0%
because the revenue was there and it
 
04:11:49.550 --> 04:11:49.560 align:start position:0%
wasn't appropriate it must have been
 
04:11:52.010 --> 04:11:52.020 align:start position:0%
savings I'm just trying to establish you
 
04:11:55.429 --> 04:11:55.439 align:start position:0%
know how you arrive to that conclusion
 
04:11:57.650 --> 04:11:57.660 align:start position:0%
that this is all property tax savings oh
 
04:11:58.969 --> 04:11:58.979 align:start position:0%
thank thank you for your question I
 
04:12:01.130 --> 04:12:01.140 align:start position:0%
appreciate that Clarity so the funds
 
04:12:03.530 --> 04:12:03.540 align:start position:0%
came in in December and for many of our
 
04:12:05.990 --> 04:12:06.000 align:start position:0%
calendar year towns I can speak to that
 
04:12:08.269 --> 04:12:08.279 align:start position:0%
their year closed so if they're fiscal
 
04:12:10.550 --> 04:12:10.560 align:start position:0%
year closed and they reported on Revenue
 
04:12:12.650 --> 04:12:12.660 align:start position:0%
in December in November when the tax
 
04:12:14.330 --> 04:12:14.340 align:start position:0%
rate is set they wouldn't have an
 
04:12:16.250 --> 04:12:16.260 align:start position:0%
opportunity to re-spend those funds
 
04:12:18.290 --> 04:12:18.300 align:start position:0%
because it would have lapsed so
 
04:12:20.570 --> 04:12:20.580 align:start position:0%
therefore I do believe in many cases
 
04:12:23.269 --> 04:12:23.279 align:start position:0%
that these funds directly did impact in
 
04:12:26.210 --> 04:12:26.220 align:start position:0%
a very positive way property taxes thank
 
04:12:28.849 --> 04:12:28.859 align:start position:0%
you thank you
 
04:12:33.410 --> 04:12:33.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:34.910 --> 04:12:34.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony thank you
 
04:12:40.849 --> 04:12:40.859 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:44.689 --> 04:12:44.699 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:56.150 --> 04:12:56.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:58.309 --> 04:12:58.319 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is Gene dietch
 
04:13:01.309 --> 04:13:01.319 align:start position:0%
and thank you Mr chairman and members of
 
04:13:02.870 --> 04:13:02.880 align:start position:0%
the committee for listening to my
 
04:13:04.910 --> 04:13:04.920 align:start position:0%
testimony today
 
04:13:08.330 --> 04:13:08.340 align:start position:0%
I'm here representing a group that I I
 
04:13:11.510 --> 04:13:11.520 align:start position:0%
chair old Granite State matters
 
04:13:15.110 --> 04:13:15.120 align:start position:0%
were a media organization with 4 000
 
04:13:17.389 --> 04:13:17.399 align:start position:0%
members and subscribers
 
04:13:20.990 --> 04:13:21.000 align:start position:0%
and our goal is to make the public aware
 
04:13:24.950 --> 04:13:24.960 align:start position:0%
of how what elected officials do affects
 
04:13:28.550 --> 04:13:28.560 align:start position:0%
their pocketbooks and their daily lives
 
04:13:31.490 --> 04:13:31.500 align:start position:0%
so I thank you for your one-time
 
04:13:33.889 --> 04:13:33.899 align:start position:0%
contribution to the group one and group
 
04:13:36.530 --> 04:13:36.540 align:start position:0%
2 pension sharing last year
 
04:13:38.630 --> 04:13:38.640 align:start position:0%
and for considering making that
 
04:13:41.110 --> 04:13:41.120 align:start position:0%
permanent with hb50
 
04:13:45.229 --> 04:13:45.239 align:start position:0%
costing about 26 million next year what
 
04:13:48.290 --> 04:13:48.300 align:start position:0%
I want to suggest is that that is not
 
04:13:51.170 --> 04:13:51.180 align:start position:0%
enough for your constituents
 
04:13:54.469 --> 04:13:54.479 align:start position:0%
I was in ways and means on Tuesday
 
04:13:58.130 --> 04:13:58.140 align:start position:0%
and uh testimony there said that New
 
04:14:00.710 --> 04:14:00.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is first to recover in
 
04:14:00.720 --> 04:14:02.150 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is first to recover in
recessions

04:14:02.150 --> 04:14:02.160 align:start position:0%
recessions
 
04:14:05.269 --> 04:14:05.279 align:start position:0%
but what they did not say is that that
 
04:14:07.729 --> 04:14:07.739 align:start position:0%
recovery was based on downloading a
 
04:14:11.330 --> 04:14:11.340 align:start position:0%
hundred million dollars and expenses to
 
04:14:14.030 --> 04:14:14.040 align:start position:0%
towns and property taxpayers
 
04:14:17.269 --> 04:14:17.279 align:start position:0%
and we've done that for at least 10
 
04:14:18.530 --> 04:14:18.540 align:start position:0%
years now
 
04:14:21.830 --> 04:14:21.840 align:start position:0%
that's if my my calculation almost a
 
04:14:23.330 --> 04:14:23.340 align:start position:0%
billion dollars
 
04:14:25.490 --> 04:14:25.500 align:start position:0%
that taxpayers
 
04:14:29.150 --> 04:14:29.160 align:start position:0%
mostly taxpayer property tax funding has
 
04:14:31.929 --> 04:14:31.939 align:start position:0%
lent to the state what would the bond
 
04:14:35.090 --> 04:14:35.100 align:start position:0%
interest be on that payment if they had
 
04:14:37.309 --> 04:14:37.319 align:start position:0%
had to borrow it if the state had had to
 
04:14:41.030 --> 04:14:41.040 align:start position:0%
borrow it that's a billion dollars so
 
04:14:44.750 --> 04:14:44.760 align:start position:0%
really 26 million for one year thank you
 
04:14:47.689 --> 04:14:47.699 align:start position:0%
very much but that's only the start and
 
04:14:51.050 --> 04:14:51.060 align:start position:0%
we really need at this point to give
 
04:14:53.090 --> 04:14:53.100 align:start position:0%
towns back
 
04:14:56.630 --> 04:14:56.640 align:start position:0%
what has been taken from them
 
04:14:58.010 --> 04:14:58.020 align:start position:0%
on two
 
04:15:01.429 --> 04:15:01.439 align:start position:0%
in Ways and Means some lawmakers had the
 
04:15:05.110 --> 04:15:05.120 align:start position:0%
audacity to support a bill called HB 100
 
04:15:09.410 --> 04:15:09.420 align:start position:0%
which would have taken the interest in
 
04:15:12.590 --> 04:15:12.600 align:start position:0%
dividends tax to zero
 
04:15:15.590 --> 04:15:15.600 align:start position:0%
they said that we don't no longer need
 
04:15:19.490 --> 04:15:19.500 align:start position:0%
the 113 million dollars that that tax
 
04:15:22.550 --> 04:15:22.560 align:start position:0%
would bring in if it were at the five
 
04:15:26.150 --> 04:15:26.160 align:start position:0%
percent level it's traditionally been at
 
04:15:28.729 --> 04:15:28.739 align:start position:0%
um were the state's doing so well that
 
04:15:31.070 --> 04:15:31.080 align:start position:0%
we don't need to tax that anymore of
 
04:15:34.250 --> 04:15:34.260 align:start position:0%
course that particular tax uh goes to
 
04:15:38.269 --> 04:15:38.279 align:start position:0%
some is paid almost all by the top five
 
04:15:40.130 --> 04:15:40.140 align:start position:0%
percent of
 
04:15:42.830 --> 04:15:42.840 align:start position:0%
um dividend and interest earners in the
 
04:15:42.840 --> 04:15:44.269 align:start position:0%
um dividend and interest earners in the
state

04:15:44.269 --> 04:15:44.279 align:start position:0%
state
 
04:15:46.910 --> 04:15:46.920 align:start position:0%
um but uh it said that we no longer need
 
04:15:48.889 --> 04:15:48.899 align:start position:0%
that money
 
04:15:48.899 --> 04:15:49.670 align:start position:0%
that money
um

04:15:49.670 --> 04:15:49.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:15:53.689 --> 04:15:53.699 align:start position:0%
that 113 million would fund next year's
 
04:15:57.349 --> 04:15:57.359 align:start position:0%
pensions up to about 32 percent
 
04:16:00.469 --> 04:16:00.479 align:start position:0%
so shouldn't a state that's touting its
 
04:16:02.570 --> 04:16:02.580 align:start position:0%
ability to quick recovery and its
 
04:16:04.790 --> 04:16:04.800 align:start position:0%
excellent economy face up to the
 
04:16:07.189 --> 04:16:07.199 align:start position:0%
responsibilities to municipalities
 
04:16:10.070 --> 04:16:10.080 align:start position:0%
and instead of cutting taxes on those
 
04:16:12.050 --> 04:16:12.060 align:start position:0%
most stable to pay
 
04:16:14.330 --> 04:16:14.340 align:start position:0%
shouldn't it be at least picking up its
 
04:16:16.610 --> 04:16:16.620 align:start position:0%
share of the pension burden in upcoming
 
04:16:18.530 --> 04:16:18.540 align:start position:0%
years even if it never pays back the
 
04:16:18.540 --> 04:16:19.490 align:start position:0%
years even if it never pays back the
billion

04:16:19.490 --> 04:16:19.500 align:start position:0%
billion
 
04:16:21.830 --> 04:16:21.840 align:start position:0%
that it shirked
 
04:16:23.750 --> 04:16:23.760 align:start position:0%
if you look at the sheet that I handed
 
04:16:25.189 --> 04:16:25.199 align:start position:0%
out you'll see
 
04:16:28.490 --> 04:16:28.500 align:start position:0%
how our population has changed
 
04:16:31.729 --> 04:16:31.739 align:start position:0%
uh over the last
 
04:16:34.370 --> 04:16:34.380 align:start position:0%
over the last decade
 
04:16:36.290 --> 04:16:36.300 align:start position:0%
you'll see that New Hampshire families
 
04:16:38.929 --> 04:16:38.939 align:start position:0%
have been forced out
 
04:16:42.889 --> 04:16:42.899 align:start position:0%
our our level of school-led children has
 
04:16:46.729 --> 04:16:46.739 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:50.389 --> 04:16:50.399 align:start position:0%
while our level of seniors has risen 47
 
04:16:50.399 --> 04:16:52.010 align:start position:0%
while our level of seniors has risen 47
percent

04:16:52.010 --> 04:16:52.020 align:start position:0%
percent
 
04:16:54.410 --> 04:16:54.420 align:start position:0%
and my neighbors an award-winning
 
04:16:56.689 --> 04:16:56.699 align:start position:0%
realtor and she tells me that it's
 
04:16:59.809 --> 04:16:59.819 align:start position:0%
gotten worse since the pandemic that she
 
04:17:02.809 --> 04:17:02.819 align:start position:0%
now speaks almost solely to 50 through
 
04:17:05.090 --> 04:17:05.100 align:start position:0%
70 year olds and that the 30 year old
 
04:17:07.130 --> 04:17:07.140 align:start position:0%
she's talking to who can afford to move
 
04:17:10.189 --> 04:17:10.199 align:start position:0%
here are childless
 
04:17:13.250 --> 04:17:13.260 align:start position:0%
so that's where our state's headed and
 
04:17:15.110 --> 04:17:15.120 align:start position:0%
the property tax problem is part of it
 
04:17:16.429 --> 04:17:16.439 align:start position:0%
as you all know it's much more
 
04:17:18.410 --> 04:17:18.420 align:start position:0%
complicated than just property taxes
 
04:17:21.710 --> 04:17:21.720 align:start position:0%
we've got housing and many other issues
 
04:17:24.530 --> 04:17:24.540 align:start position:0%
but we can start with the property tax
 
04:17:27.309 --> 04:17:27.319 align:start position:0%
so I suggest that you not only support
 
04:17:31.429 --> 04:17:31.439 align:start position:0%
hb50 but amend it to return at least 32
 
04:17:33.170 --> 04:17:33.180 align:start position:0%
percent in Revenue sharing to the
 
04:17:36.349 --> 04:17:36.359 align:start position:0%
municipalities you represent
 
04:17:39.229 --> 04:17:39.239 align:start position:0%
um and I hope that when it comes round
 
04:17:42.950 --> 04:17:42.960 align:start position:0%
to HP 192 that you all support that bill
 
04:17:44.050 --> 04:17:44.060 align:start position:0%
as well
 
04:17:47.870 --> 04:17:47.880 align:start position:0%
I pay that tax I'm willing to continue
 
04:17:50.210 --> 04:17:50.220 align:start position:0%
to pay that tax because I know that the
 
04:17:54.290 --> 04:17:54.300 align:start position:0%
future of our state relies upon it
 
04:17:56.929 --> 04:17:56.939 align:start position:0%
um so I assure you that Granite State
 
04:17:58.849 --> 04:17:58.859 align:start position:0%
matters will be reporting
 
04:18:01.250 --> 04:18:01.260 align:start position:0%
on this committee and Ways and Means
 
04:18:04.849 --> 04:18:04.859 align:start position:0%
actions and I thank you for listening
 
04:18:06.889 --> 04:18:06.899 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for your testimony any
 
04:18:09.170 --> 04:18:09.180 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
04:18:10.849 --> 04:18:10.859 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards
 
04:18:14.150 --> 04:18:14.160 align:start position:0%
uh uh thank you for taking my question
 
04:18:17.330 --> 04:18:17.340 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I I I just want to
 
04:18:19.729 --> 04:18:19.739 align:start position:0%
make sure I understand an assertion in
 
04:18:23.510 --> 04:18:23.520 align:start position:0%
any uh data that you have to support uh
 
04:18:25.670 --> 04:18:25.680 align:start position:0%
something I I think I'm I'm hearing you
 
04:18:28.189 --> 04:18:28.199 align:start position:0%
say that
 
04:18:28.199 --> 04:18:29.330 align:start position:0%
say that
um

04:18:29.330 --> 04:18:29.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:18:32.450 --> 04:18:32.460 align:start position:0%
because we haven't been contributing as
 
04:18:35.450 --> 04:18:35.460 align:start position:0%
much as we initially promised that's
 
04:18:38.510 --> 04:18:38.520 align:start position:0%
caused the flight of young people from
 
04:18:40.750 --> 04:18:40.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire that there's a causative
 
04:18:44.630 --> 04:18:44.640 align:start position:0%
action between failing to fund the
 
04:18:47.990 --> 04:18:48.000 align:start position:0%
pension at promised rates and a
 
04:18:50.389 --> 04:18:50.399 align:start position:0%
reduction of school-aged children to 12
 
04:18:52.269 --> 04:18:52.279 align:start position:0%
to 13 percent
 
04:18:55.010 --> 04:18:55.020 align:start position:0%
can you help me understand the science
 
04:18:57.110 --> 04:18:57.120 align:start position:0%
behind that and what research you have
 
04:18:59.750 --> 04:18:59.760 align:start position:0%
to draw that conclusion representative
 
04:19:01.309 --> 04:19:01.319 align:start position:0%
Edwards you know that it's much more
 
04:19:03.170 --> 04:19:03.180 align:start position:0%
complicated than that it's not I know
 
04:19:05.030 --> 04:19:05.040 align:start position:0%
I'm just asking about your assertion I
 
04:19:08.269 --> 04:19:08.279 align:start position:0%
will I will connect to those dots
 
04:19:08.279 --> 04:19:09.189 align:start position:0%
will I will connect to those dots
um

04:19:09.189 --> 04:19:09.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:19:12.950 --> 04:19:12.960 align:start position:0%
the lack of funding has raised property
 
04:19:15.830 --> 04:19:15.840 align:start position:0%
taxes and property taxes as we all know
 
04:19:19.670 --> 04:19:19.680 align:start position:0%
are one of the issues that are facing
 
04:19:22.330 --> 04:19:22.340 align:start position:0%
families trying to live here
 
04:19:26.389 --> 04:19:26.399 align:start position:0%
and the fact that it's very complex the
 
04:19:28.130 --> 04:19:28.140 align:start position:0%
fact that salaries
 
04:19:33.349 --> 04:19:33.359 align:start position:0%
have not kept up with the increases in
 
04:19:35.750 --> 04:19:35.760 align:start position:0%
costs of both property and property
 
04:19:39.590 --> 04:19:39.600 align:start position:0%
taxes and everything else is part of
 
04:19:42.410 --> 04:19:42.420 align:start position:0%
what's causing it's certainly not the
 
04:19:46.010 --> 04:19:46.020 align:start position:0%
sole reason but we can only start to
 
04:19:48.469 --> 04:19:48.479 align:start position:0%
address these things in steps and this
 
04:19:51.889 --> 04:19:51.899 align:start position:0%
is a step we can take I'll just add by
 
04:19:55.610 --> 04:19:55.620 align:start position:0%
the way that the 113 million is the dra
 
04:20:00.530 --> 04:20:00.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:03.650 --> 04:20:03.660 align:start position:0%
follow up so so would you believe that
 
04:20:07.010 --> 04:20:07.020 align:start position:0%
we heard the Bea testify in the last
 
04:20:10.670 --> 04:20:10.680 align:start position:0%
week or two on um changing demographics
 
04:20:13.429 --> 04:20:13.439 align:start position:0%
to say that they are able to determine
 
04:20:15.650 --> 04:20:15.660 align:start position:0%
why people are moving in the state
 
04:20:18.110 --> 04:20:18.120 align:start position:0%
because they're available to survey and
 
04:20:20.870 --> 04:20:20.880 align:start position:0%
ask them but that they are unable to
 
04:20:23.510 --> 04:20:23.520 align:start position:0%
tell us officially the reasons why they
 
04:20:25.790 --> 04:20:25.800 align:start position:0%
depart because once they leave the state
 
04:20:29.330 --> 04:20:29.340 align:start position:0%
we lose the ability to survey them and
 
04:20:32.750 --> 04:20:32.760 align:start position:0%
ask them and and because our own
 
04:20:35.330 --> 04:20:35.340 align:start position:0%
Department can't figure it out I'm I'm
 
04:20:38.689 --> 04:20:38.699 align:start position:0%
still interested in what research you
 
04:20:41.929 --> 04:20:41.939 align:start position:0%
have to to to back up your assertion in
 
04:20:45.950 --> 04:20:45.960 align:start position:0%
the midst of a complex situation
 
04:20:48.290 --> 04:20:48.300 align:start position:0%
okay well if you look at our total and
 
04:20:51.410 --> 04:20:51.420 align:start position:0%
school enrollments it's obvious that we
 
04:20:53.330 --> 04:20:53.340 align:start position:0%
are losing children so there's no
 
04:20:56.210 --> 04:20:56.220 align:start position:0%
question about that right and and the
 
04:20:59.210 --> 04:20:59.220 align:start position:0%
Census Bureau figures show that we are
 
04:21:01.429 --> 04:21:01.439 align:start position:0%
losing children now your question is why
 
04:21:03.590 --> 04:21:03.600 align:start position:0%
we are losing children that's also a
 
04:21:06.349 --> 04:21:06.359 align:start position:0%
complex thing uh uh people are having
 
04:21:09.410 --> 04:21:09.420 align:start position:0%
fewer children but what um
 
04:21:09.420 --> 04:21:10.849 align:start position:0%
fewer children but what um
what the

04:21:10.849 --> 04:21:10.859 align:start position:0%
what the
 
04:21:13.370 --> 04:21:13.380 align:start position:0%
department is able to tell you and I'm
 
04:21:16.910 --> 04:21:16.920 align:start position:0%
sure told you is that we are gaining
 
04:21:21.290 --> 04:21:21.300 align:start position:0%
people from immigration and if we are
 
04:21:23.090 --> 04:21:23.100 align:start position:0%
losing people
 
04:21:25.849 --> 04:21:25.859 align:start position:0%
maybe of all ages though that's not what
 
04:21:29.090 --> 04:21:29.100 align:start position:0%
census shows and we are gaining only
 
04:21:32.030 --> 04:21:32.040 align:start position:0%
older people it's pretty obvious that we
 
04:21:35.809 --> 04:21:35.819 align:start position:0%
are losing families and that uh the we
 
04:21:35.819 --> 04:21:36.710 align:start position:0%
are losing families and that uh the we
know

04:21:36.710 --> 04:21:36.720 align:start position:0%
know
 
04:21:39.590 --> 04:21:39.600 align:start position:0%
that the people who are coming here as
 
04:21:41.330 --> 04:21:41.340 align:start position:0%
my realtor friend told you and as I'm
 
04:21:43.309 --> 04:21:43.319 align:start position:0%
sure the department probably told you
 
04:21:46.849 --> 04:21:46.859 align:start position:0%
are people who are quite affluent and
 
04:21:48.590 --> 04:21:48.600 align:start position:0%
they have to be in order to pay the
 
04:21:49.969 --> 04:21:49.979 align:start position:0%
prices and the taxes and everything
 
04:21:53.870 --> 04:21:53.880 align:start position:0%
that's here so by definition if only
 
04:22:00.530 --> 04:22:00.540 align:start position:0%
affluent seniors and singles can move in
 
04:22:02.870 --> 04:22:02.880 align:start position:0%
and across the board people are moving
 
04:22:02.880 --> 04:22:04.010 align:start position:0%
and across the board people are moving
out

04:22:04.010 --> 04:22:04.020 align:start position:0%
out
 
04:22:06.050 --> 04:22:06.060 align:start position:0%
children are growing older they're not
 
04:22:10.809 --> 04:22:10.819 align:start position:0%
being replaced that is what shows that
 
04:22:15.050 --> 04:22:15.060 align:start position:0%
the lack of affordability
 
04:22:17.630 --> 04:22:17.640 align:start position:0%
is an issue here there's there are two
 
04:22:17.640 --> 04:22:18.769 align:start position:0%
is an issue here there's there are two
experiments

04:22:18.769 --> 04:22:18.779 align:start position:0%
experiments
 
04:22:21.050 --> 04:22:21.060 align:start position:0%
um going on one I believe in each of our
 
04:22:23.050 --> 04:22:23.060 align:start position:0%
cities in Concord and Manchester
 
04:22:26.870 --> 04:22:26.880 align:start position:0%
in which they have some very affordable
 
04:22:26.880 --> 04:22:28.490 align:start position:0%
in which they have some very affordable
housing

04:22:28.490 --> 04:22:28.500 align:start position:0%
housing
 
04:22:32.990 --> 04:22:33.000 align:start position:0%
and by providing this a very affordable
 
04:22:35.450 --> 04:22:35.460 align:start position:0%
housing they have been able to attract
 
04:22:37.610 --> 04:22:37.620 align:start position:0%
some low-income families so there are
 
04:22:40.450 --> 04:22:40.460 align:start position:0%
projects going on that would suggest
 
04:22:44.689 --> 04:22:44.699 align:start position:0%
that it is an income factor and that we
 
04:22:46.849 --> 04:22:46.859 align:start position:0%
can attract people if we can get our
 
04:22:49.309 --> 04:22:49.319 align:start position:0%
prices down and as I say this is just
 
04:22:51.110 --> 04:22:51.120 align:start position:0%
one step
 
04:22:55.689 --> 04:22:55.699 align:start position:0%
and it's a step that we can take by not
 
04:22:55.699 --> 04:22:57.290 align:start position:0%
and it's a step that we can take by not
cutting

04:22:57.290 --> 04:22:57.300 align:start position:0%
cutting
 
04:22:59.330 --> 04:22:59.340 align:start position:0%
the IND
 
04:23:04.490 --> 04:23:04.500 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:07.250 --> 04:23:07.260 align:start position:0%
uh further questions
 
04:23:15.650 --> 04:23:15.660 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:28.969 --> 04:23:28.979 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:31.309 --> 04:23:31.319 align:start position:0%
hello good afternoon Marie Mullen
 
04:23:32.870 --> 04:23:32.880 align:start position:0%
Director of Finance from the New
 
04:23:35.330 --> 04:23:35.340 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Retirement System
 
04:23:38.150 --> 04:23:38.160 align:start position:0%
um we have a handout coming out here for
 
04:23:41.389 --> 04:23:41.399 align:start position:0%
a bill brief from the retirement system
 
04:23:43.969 --> 04:23:43.979 align:start position:0%
first I'd just like to state that the
 
04:23:46.070 --> 04:23:46.080 align:start position:0%
retirement system neither supports nor
 
04:23:48.110 --> 04:23:48.120 align:start position:0%
opposes this legislation we're merely
 
04:23:50.750 --> 04:23:50.760 align:start position:0%
here to attest to the facts on the
 
04:23:53.030 --> 04:23:53.040 align:start position:0%
Actuarial report that we have received
 
04:23:54.950 --> 04:23:54.960 align:start position:0%
for the legislature
 
04:23:57.889 --> 04:23:57.899 align:start position:0%
so um as you've heard on the testimony
 
04:24:00.590 --> 04:24:00.600 align:start position:0%
this bill requires state pay seven and a
 
04:24:01.969 --> 04:24:01.979 align:start position:0%
half percent of the political
 
04:24:04.070 --> 04:24:04.080 align:start position:0%
subdivision employer pension
 
04:24:07.070 --> 04:24:07.080 align:start position:0%
contributions on behalf of teachers
 
04:24:10.550 --> 04:24:10.560 align:start position:0%
police officers and firefighters
 
04:24:10.560 --> 04:24:11.330 align:start position:0%
police officers and firefighters
um

04:24:11.330 --> 04:24:11.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:24:13.490 --> 04:24:13.500 align:start position:0%
the retirement system received an
 
04:24:15.830 --> 04:24:15.840 align:start position:0%
independent actuary estimate from our
 
04:24:17.809 --> 04:24:17.819 align:start position:0%
actuaries GRS
 
04:24:20.090 --> 04:24:20.100 align:start position:0%
and we estimate that the political
 
04:24:23.990 --> 04:24:24.000 align:start position:0%
subdivisions employer contribution costs
 
04:24:25.490 --> 04:24:25.500 align:start position:0%
on behalf of the teachers police
 
04:24:27.110 --> 04:24:27.120 align:start position:0%
officers and firefighters would be
 
04:24:28.550 --> 04:24:28.560 align:start position:0%
reduced by
 
04:24:32.150 --> 04:24:32.160 align:start position:0%
approximately 26 million in 2024 27
 
04:24:37.429 --> 04:24:37.439 align:start position:0%
million in 2025 and almost 28 million in
 
04:24:37.439 --> 04:24:38.870 align:start position:0%
million in 2025 and almost 28 million in
2026

04:24:38.870 --> 04:24:38.880 align:start position:0%
2026
 
04:24:41.090 --> 04:24:41.100 align:start position:0%
and the cost to the state would increase
 
04:24:43.429 --> 04:24:43.439 align:start position:0%
by that amount
 
04:24:45.950 --> 04:24:45.960 align:start position:0%
um and this would be in perpetuity so
 
04:24:47.750 --> 04:24:47.760 align:start position:0%
those costs would be
 
04:24:50.030 --> 04:24:50.040 align:start position:0%
um savings to the municipalities going
 
04:24:53.630 --> 04:24:53.640 align:start position:0%
forward and costs to the state past 2026
 
04:24:56.450 --> 04:24:56.460 align:start position:0%
this analysis only went to 2026.
 
04:24:59.929 --> 04:24:59.939 align:start position:0%
the bill does not impact the unfunded
 
04:25:02.210 --> 04:25:02.220 align:start position:0%
liability the unfunded Actuarial
 
04:25:03.769 --> 04:25:03.779 align:start position:0%
liability with the retirement system
 
04:25:06.110 --> 04:25:06.120 align:start position:0%
because it does not change the total
 
04:25:09.050 --> 04:25:09.060 align:start position:0%
amount of the employer contributions
 
04:25:10.729 --> 04:25:10.739 align:start position:0%
we've provided some additional
 
04:25:12.769 --> 04:25:12.779 align:start position:0%
background which I think the other folks
 
04:25:15.229 --> 04:25:15.239 align:start position:0%
have already testified to and I would
 
04:25:16.790 --> 04:25:16.800 align:start position:0%
just open it up to any questions that
 
04:25:18.290 --> 04:25:18.300 align:start position:0%
anyone may have
 
04:25:20.590 --> 04:25:20.600 align:start position:0%
uh questions like many oh my goodness
 
04:25:23.570 --> 04:25:23.580 align:start position:0%
representative Hawkins Phillips thank
 
04:25:25.670 --> 04:25:25.680 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair thank you for taking my
 
04:25:25.680 --> 04:25:26.809 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair thank you for taking my
question

04:25:26.809 --> 04:25:26.819 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:25:29.689 --> 04:25:29.699 align:start position:0%
um so I served in a previous uh life as
 
04:25:31.550 --> 04:25:31.560 align:start position:0%
a member of the Hanover finance
 
04:25:33.830 --> 04:25:33.840 align:start position:0%
committee and I recall in several
 
04:25:37.309 --> 04:25:37.319 align:start position:0%
meetings that the the topic of the opeb
 
04:25:39.290 --> 04:25:39.300 align:start position:0%
came up quite a bit and I was just
 
04:25:42.110 --> 04:25:42.120 align:start position:0%
wondering if you could maybe be speak a
 
04:25:44.149 --> 04:25:44.159 align:start position:0%
little explanation explainer for those
 
04:25:45.649 --> 04:25:45.659 align:start position:0%
who are watching at home who may not
 
04:25:48.170 --> 04:25:48.180 align:start position:0%
know could you speak to that unfunded
 
04:25:51.530 --> 04:25:51.540 align:start position:0%
Actuarial accrued liability and talk
 
04:25:53.689 --> 04:25:53.699 align:start position:0%
about what that concept means for the
 
04:25:56.689 --> 04:25:56.699 align:start position:0%
folks at home okay
 
04:25:56.699 --> 04:25:57.349 align:start position:0%
folks at home okay
um

04:25:57.349 --> 04:25:57.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:26:00.429 --> 04:26:00.439 align:start position:0%
so what this is is we have the actuaries
 
04:26:03.590 --> 04:26:03.600 align:start position:0%
so we have census data so we estimate
 
04:26:07.550 --> 04:26:07.560 align:start position:0%
the number of retirees what their wages
 
04:26:09.769 --> 04:26:09.779 align:start position:0%
are going to be what the investment
 
04:26:12.469 --> 04:26:12.479 align:start position:0%
earnings will be in the fund and we
 
04:26:14.469 --> 04:26:14.479 align:start position:0%
project out into the future
 
04:26:17.210 --> 04:26:17.220 align:start position:0%
over a 30-year period how much will be
 
04:26:19.610 --> 04:26:19.620 align:start position:0%
needed to fund and continue to pay the
 
04:26:22.370 --> 04:26:22.380 align:start position:0%
pensions and the other pension
 
04:26:25.250 --> 04:26:25.260 align:start position:0%
liabilities of the municipalities the
 
04:26:27.830 --> 04:26:27.840 align:start position:0%
state police and fire
 
04:26:27.840 --> 04:26:28.550 align:start position:0%
state police and fire
um

04:26:28.550 --> 04:26:28.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:26:31.070 --> 04:26:31.080 align:start position:0%
so the unfunded liability is that
 
04:26:31.080 --> 04:26:32.950 align:start position:0%
so the unfunded liability is that
portion

04:26:32.950 --> 04:26:32.960 align:start position:0%
portion
 
04:26:36.649 --> 04:26:36.659 align:start position:0%
that's identified from what has we have
 
04:26:38.090 --> 04:26:38.100 align:start position:0%
for Investments
 
04:26:40.729 --> 04:26:40.739 align:start position:0%
plus what we bring in from employers and
 
04:26:43.309 --> 04:26:43.319 align:start position:0%
then what the employees pay towards
 
04:26:46.309 --> 04:26:46.319 align:start position:0%
their retirement that difference is the
 
04:26:48.649 --> 04:26:48.659 align:start position:0%
unfunded liability So currently that's
 
04:26:51.950 --> 04:26:51.960 align:start position:0%
approximately 5.7 billion dollars of
 
04:26:57.649 --> 04:26:57.659 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:00.050 --> 04:27:00.060 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
04:27:03.290 --> 04:27:03.300 align:start position:0%
uh yes sir Mr Bobby Miller
 
04:27:05.210 --> 04:27:05.220 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
04:27:07.010 --> 04:27:07.020 align:start position:0%
my question
 
04:27:07.020 --> 04:27:07.670 align:start position:0%
my question
um

04:27:07.670 --> 04:27:07.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:27:09.469 --> 04:27:09.479 align:start position:0%
this is not one of those questions where
 
04:27:11.990 --> 04:27:12.000 align:start position:0%
I can kind of guess the answer is so I
 
04:27:13.849 --> 04:27:13.859 align:start position:0%
really don't know this
 
04:27:13.859 --> 04:27:14.630 align:start position:0%
really don't know this
um

04:27:14.630 --> 04:27:14.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:27:16.729 --> 04:27:16.739 align:start position:0%
I've hired actuaries but I'm not sure
 
04:27:18.830 --> 04:27:18.840 align:start position:0%
exactly how do they do their magic it
 
04:27:21.290 --> 04:27:21.300 align:start position:0%
tends to be rather opaque is there any
 
04:27:23.830 --> 04:27:23.840 align:start position:0%
way to look at Actuarial data and try to
 
04:27:26.290 --> 04:27:26.300 align:start position:0%
see whether
 
04:27:28.910 --> 04:27:28.920 align:start position:0%
changing who pays for the retirement
 
04:27:30.950 --> 04:27:30.960 align:start position:0%
fund whether a larger share is paid by
 
04:27:32.990 --> 04:27:33.000 align:start position:0%
the state or by the municipalities has
 
04:27:35.090 --> 04:27:35.100 align:start position:0%
an impact on the wages and benefits the
 
04:27:39.229 --> 04:27:39.239 align:start position:0%
total compensations paid by the towns
 
04:27:41.870 --> 04:27:41.880 align:start position:0%
um I am not sure if we've done
 
04:27:44.630 --> 04:27:44.640 align:start position:0%
um a study or had had the actuaries do
 
04:27:46.070 --> 04:27:46.080 align:start position:0%
that before that's something I could go
 
04:27:47.090 --> 04:27:47.100 align:start position:0%
back and
 
04:27:49.490 --> 04:27:49.500 align:start position:0%
and look into and find out I would
 
04:27:50.689 --> 04:27:50.699 align:start position:0%
appreciate at least knowing whether
 
04:27:52.130 --> 04:27:52.140 align:start position:0%
that's a question they could answer
 
04:27:54.290 --> 04:27:54.300 align:start position:0%
hypothetically because I really don't
 
04:27:56.929 --> 04:27:56.939 align:start position:0%
know whether they could but thank you if
 
04:27:58.130 --> 04:27:58.140 align:start position:0%
you could follow up it would be
 
04:28:00.349 --> 04:28:00.359 align:start position:0%
appreciated can you just repeat that
 
04:28:02.750 --> 04:28:02.760 align:start position:0%
question I would just like to know
 
04:28:05.210 --> 04:28:05.220 align:start position:0%
whether actuaries have the ability to
 
04:28:08.269 --> 04:28:08.279 align:start position:0%
determine whether a change in who pays
 
04:28:10.309 --> 04:28:10.319 align:start position:0%
whether the state base or the
 
04:28:12.309 --> 04:28:12.319 align:start position:0%
municipality pays different shares
 
04:28:15.469 --> 04:28:15.479 align:start position:0%
changes the total amount of compensation
 
04:28:18.110 --> 04:28:18.120 align:start position:0%
paid by the towns depending on you know
 
04:28:20.030 --> 04:28:20.040 align:start position:0%
whether they are fully responsible or
 
04:28:22.130 --> 04:28:22.140 align:start position:0%
they are only partly responsible for the
 
04:28:23.990 --> 04:28:24.000 align:start position:0%
retirement contributions I'm just
 
04:28:26.090 --> 04:28:26.100 align:start position:0%
looking for scientific data you know one
 
04:28:28.010 --> 04:28:28.020 align:start position:0%
way or the other
 
04:28:31.610 --> 04:28:31.620 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:33.710 --> 04:28:33.720 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards
 
04:28:36.950 --> 04:28:36.960 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chair I I I don't know
 
04:28:39.670 --> 04:28:39.680 align:start position:0%
if uh the department has thought about
 
04:28:42.229 --> 04:28:42.239 align:start position:0%
taking a position on this but if we
 
04:28:45.170 --> 04:28:45.180 align:start position:0%
could only do one thing which thing do
 
04:28:49.130 --> 04:28:49.140 align:start position:0%
you think would uh benefit our our bond
 
04:28:52.010 --> 04:28:52.020 align:start position:0%
ratings more and improve the stability
 
04:28:54.769 --> 04:28:54.779 align:start position:0%
over all of the Pension funds
 
04:28:59.450 --> 04:28:59.460 align:start position:0%
a uh having State money replace local
 
04:29:03.590 --> 04:29:03.600 align:start position:0%
money keeping the total liability the
 
04:29:06.469 --> 04:29:06.479 align:start position:0%
same or instead taking whatever money
 
04:29:08.450 --> 04:29:08.460 align:start position:0%
the state might have contributed that
 
04:29:11.689 --> 04:29:11.699 align:start position:0%
way and directly reducing the accrued
 
04:29:14.750 --> 04:29:14.760 align:start position:0%
liability which which one would
 
04:29:16.910 --> 04:29:16.920 align:start position:0%
strategically be a better economic
 
04:29:16.920 --> 04:29:18.590 align:start position:0%
strategically be a better economic
choice

04:29:18.590 --> 04:29:18.600 align:start position:0%
choice
 
04:29:18.600 --> 04:29:19.790 align:start position:0%
choice
um

04:29:19.790 --> 04:29:19.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:29:22.309 --> 04:29:22.319 align:start position:0%
then I will just state that the
 
04:29:23.809 --> 04:29:23.819 align:start position:0%
retirement system does not have a
 
04:29:26.450 --> 04:29:26.460 align:start position:0%
position and maybe we could talk offline
 
04:29:28.729 --> 04:29:28.739 align:start position:0%
about that but I'm not prepared to
 
04:29:34.610 --> 04:29:34.620 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:34.620 --> 04:29:36.649 align:start position:0%
 
representative

04:29:36.649 --> 04:29:36.659 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:29:38.689 --> 04:29:38.699 align:start position:0%
very much and thank you for taking my
 
04:29:38.699 --> 04:29:39.590 align:start position:0%
very much and thank you for taking my
question

04:29:39.590 --> 04:29:39.600 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:29:41.450 --> 04:29:41.460 align:start position:0%
um could you just
 
04:29:44.330 --> 04:29:44.340 align:start position:0%
give us a little bit of a synopsis of
 
04:29:46.670 --> 04:29:46.680 align:start position:0%
the history of when this commitment was
 
04:29:50.870 --> 04:29:50.880 align:start position:0%
made to the towns and whether towns
 
04:29:54.349 --> 04:29:54.359 align:start position:0%
acted in Reliance on the commitment by
 
04:29:57.070 --> 04:29:57.080 align:start position:0%
the state to pay 40 percent of the
 
04:30:00.710 --> 04:30:00.720 align:start position:0%
retirement costs in developing their
 
04:30:04.370 --> 04:30:04.380 align:start position:0%
retirement programs
 
04:30:06.349 --> 04:30:06.359 align:start position:0%
um I will say I'm not an expert on this
 
04:30:08.149 --> 04:30:08.159 align:start position:0%
many of you may remember I was
 
04:30:09.349 --> 04:30:09.359 align:start position:0%
previously with Department of
 
04:30:10.790 --> 04:30:10.800 align:start position:0%
Transportation so I've been with
 
04:30:12.769 --> 04:30:12.779 align:start position:0%
retirement for four months
 
04:30:15.830 --> 04:30:15.840 align:start position:0%
um the background on our our sheet here
 
04:30:17.149 --> 04:30:17.159 align:start position:0%
is some of the background that we're
 
04:30:18.889 --> 04:30:18.899 align:start position:0%
aware of so
 
04:30:21.530 --> 04:30:21.540 align:start position:0%
um I'm I'm not in the position to
 
04:30:22.969 --> 04:30:22.979 align:start position:0%
provide a lot of the background at this
 
04:30:26.269 --> 04:30:26.279 align:start position:0%
time but we can get that for you our Pio
 
04:30:28.370 --> 04:30:28.380 align:start position:0%
is out ill and that's why I'm testifying
 
04:30:31.910 --> 04:30:31.920 align:start position:0%
today so I apologize for the lack of
 
04:30:34.070 --> 04:30:34.080 align:start position:0%
background for you
 
04:30:35.750 --> 04:30:35.760 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
04:30:37.969 --> 04:30:37.979 align:start position:0%
um well I'm a new member of finance and
 
04:30:40.010 --> 04:30:40.020 align:start position:0%
a lot of folks may know the history of
 
04:30:43.370 --> 04:30:43.380 align:start position:0%
the uh where this promise came from and
 
04:30:46.429 --> 04:30:46.439 align:start position:0%
why and who relied on what and I think
 
04:30:48.530 --> 04:30:48.540 align:start position:0%
it's interesting as we look at the
 
04:30:51.110 --> 04:30:51.120 align:start position:0%
amount of contribution that's expected
 
04:30:53.210 --> 04:30:53.220 align:start position:0%
to know what representations were made
 
04:30:55.490 --> 04:30:55.500 align:start position:0%
to the town when it first came into
 
04:30:55.500 --> 04:30:56.450 align:start position:0%
to the town when it first came into
place

04:30:56.450 --> 04:30:56.460 align:start position:0%
place
 
04:31:00.769 --> 04:31:00.779 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:04.849 --> 04:31:04.859 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:06.530 --> 04:31:06.540 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony okay thank
 
04:31:06.540 --> 04:31:07.910 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony okay thank

you

04:31:08.990 --> 04:31:09.000 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:31:15.830 --> 04:31:15.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:19.010 --> 04:31:19.020 align:start position:0%
thank you uh Mr chair uh representative

Mike O'Brien uh represent the city of
 
04:31:26.330 --> 04:31:26.340 align:start position:0%
Nashua ward nine uh besides let's do the
 
04:31:30.290 --> 04:31:30.300 align:start position:0%
usual caveats uh I am a State Rep I am
 
04:31:31.969 --> 04:31:31.979 align:start position:0%
also vice president of the board of
 
04:31:34.910 --> 04:31:34.920 align:start position:0%
alderman in the great city of Nashua and
 
04:31:37.250 --> 04:31:37.260 align:start position:0%
I'm also the other helmet that I wear is
 
04:31:40.910 --> 04:31:40.920 align:start position:0%
a retired Deputy fire chief so I have a
 
04:31:43.729 --> 04:31:43.739 align:start position:0%
fair to middle and understanding of the
 
04:31:47.090 --> 04:31:47.100 align:start position:0%
pension system and I can take you a
 
04:31:50.269 --> 04:31:50.279 align:start position:0%
little bit down the road of you know the
 
04:31:52.630 --> 04:31:52.640 align:start position:0%
pension system
 
04:31:55.670 --> 04:31:55.680 align:start position:0%
basically prior and I don't want to you
 
04:31:57.290 --> 04:31:57.300 align:start position:0%
know take too much time so if I do
 
04:31:59.510 --> 04:31:59.520 align:start position:0%
please stop me this is difficult for an
 
04:32:03.710 --> 04:32:03.720 align:start position:0%
Irishman to speak quickly but anyways in
 
04:32:06.769 --> 04:32:06.779 align:start position:0%
the early late 60s I should say they
 
04:32:08.929 --> 04:32:08.939 align:start position:0%
came an idea that took four different
 
04:32:11.689 --> 04:32:11.699 align:start position:0%
pension groups and to combine them into
 
04:32:14.689 --> 04:32:14.699 align:start position:0%
one and they gave the options to the
 
04:32:18.290 --> 04:32:18.300 align:start position:0%
cities and towns and joining it and they
 
04:32:20.750 --> 04:32:20.760 align:start position:0%
made a certain promise and this is what
 
04:32:22.849 --> 04:32:22.859 align:start position:0%
you might hear as the promise made as a
 
04:32:25.309 --> 04:32:25.319 align:start position:0%
promise kept but they came up and said
 
04:32:26.689 --> 04:32:26.699 align:start position:0%
for joining into the New Hampshire
 
04:32:30.370 --> 04:32:30.380 align:start position:0%
retirement system we'll pay 40 percent
 
04:32:33.530 --> 04:32:33.540 align:start position:0%
that was the original agreement
 
04:32:36.649 --> 04:32:36.659 align:start position:0%
past legislatures came in and changed it
 
04:32:40.250 --> 04:32:40.260 align:start position:0%
from 40 to 35 percent that remain in
 
04:32:40.260 --> 04:32:41.269 align:start position:0%
from 40 to 35 percent that remain in
effect

04:32:41.269 --> 04:32:41.279 align:start position:0%
effect
 
04:32:41.279 --> 04:32:43.149 align:start position:0%
effect
from

04:32:43.149 --> 04:32:43.159 align:start position:0%
from
 
04:32:47.750 --> 04:32:47.760 align:start position:0%
1968 until 2011. you say what is the
 
04:32:49.429 --> 04:32:49.439 align:start position:0%
problem with the New Hampshire
 
04:32:51.710 --> 04:32:51.720 align:start position:0%
retirement system I'll tell you directly
 
04:32:54.050 --> 04:32:54.060 align:start position:0%
and let me be blunt the problem with the
 
04:32:56.330 --> 04:32:56.340 align:start position:0%
retirement system is 400 state
 
04:32:56.340 --> 04:32:58.070 align:start position:0%
retirement system is 400 state
representatives

04:32:58.070 --> 04:32:58.080 align:start position:0%
representatives
 
04:33:01.070 --> 04:33:01.080 align:start position:0%
in other words when you put money away
 
04:33:04.189 --> 04:33:04.199 align:start position:0%
into a pension system it's not to be
 
04:33:07.189 --> 04:33:07.199 align:start position:0%
played with every biennium
 
04:33:10.070 --> 04:33:10.080 align:start position:0%
and this is why we ended up right here
 
04:33:13.490 --> 04:33:13.500 align:start position:0%
to what is the problem in 2011 certain
 
04:33:15.051 --> 04:33:15.061 align:start position:0%
Cuts were made
 
04:33:17.209 --> 04:33:17.219 align:start position:0%
can't go out and blame the employees
 
04:33:19.970 --> 04:33:19.980 align:start position:0%
when I started in the fire service my
 
04:33:22.310 --> 04:33:22.320 align:start position:0%
contribution as an employee was 93
 
04:33:24.830 --> 04:33:24.840 align:start position:0%
quarter percent when I left I was paying
 
04:33:24.840 --> 04:33:27.051 align:start position:0%
quarter percent when I left I was paying
11.85

04:33:27.051 --> 04:33:27.061 align:start position:0%
11.85
 
04:33:30.349 --> 04:33:30.359 align:start position:0%
so the employees are making up the bulk
 
04:33:33.349 --> 04:33:33.359 align:start position:0%
of the the system there was holidays
 
04:33:36.230 --> 04:33:36.240 align:start position:0%
that's became the unfunded liability
 
04:33:39.230 --> 04:33:39.240 align:start position:0%
another problem but what's before you
 
04:33:42.051 --> 04:33:42.061 align:start position:0%
write here in house bill 50 does not
 
04:33:44.570 --> 04:33:44.580 align:start position:0%
affect the unfunded liability
 
04:33:47.449 --> 04:33:47.459 align:start position:0%
has nothing to do with it whatsoever
 
04:33:49.310 --> 04:33:49.320 align:start position:0%
that will still be paid by the
 
04:33:52.070 --> 04:33:52.080 align:start position:0%
municipalities but what's happening to
 
04:33:55.490 --> 04:33:55.500 align:start position:0%
municipalities it's because of the
 
04:33:58.250 --> 04:33:58.260 align:start position:0%
cutback the 35 percent at the State of
 
04:34:02.209 --> 04:34:02.219 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire paid vaporized well you
 
04:34:02.219 --> 04:34:03.170 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire paid vaporized well you
know

04:34:03.170 --> 04:34:03.180 align:start position:0%
know
 
04:34:05.750 --> 04:34:05.760 align:start position:0%
what bank will make any type of loan or
 
04:34:08.750 --> 04:34:08.760 align:start position:0%
a commitment or contract to vaporize you
 
04:34:11.269 --> 04:34:11.279 align:start position:0%
don't so where did that go back that
 
04:34:13.730 --> 04:34:13.740 align:start position:0%
went right back to the local taxpayers
 
04:34:16.010 --> 04:34:16.020 align:start position:0%
who have people in the New Hampshire
 
04:34:18.529 --> 04:34:18.539 align:start position:0%
retirement system let's face it you
 
04:34:20.510 --> 04:34:20.520 align:start position:0%
could call it what you want you could
 
04:34:23.810 --> 04:34:23.820 align:start position:0%
put lipstick on the pig but it's a tax
 
04:34:27.131 --> 04:34:27.141 align:start position:0%
in other words the missing of that 35
 
04:34:30.289 --> 04:34:30.299 align:start position:0%
contribution by the state came out to be
 
04:34:32.750 --> 04:34:32.760 align:start position:0%
born by the taxpayers of many of the
 
04:34:36.529 --> 04:34:36.539 align:start position:0%
communities in the example of Nashua
 
04:34:38.869 --> 04:34:38.879 align:start position:0%
this comes down annually to about two
 
04:34:41.209 --> 04:34:41.219 align:start position:0%
million dollars two million dollars in
 
04:34:43.789 --> 04:34:43.799 align:start position:0%
the city of Nashua comes down to
 
04:34:47.750 --> 04:34:47.760 align:start position:0%
basically one percent of the tax rate so
 
04:34:50.109 --> 04:34:50.119 align:start position:0%
that means one percent of the tax rate
 
04:34:53.269 --> 04:34:53.279 align:start position:0%
is being paid
 
04:34:56.090 --> 04:34:56.100 align:start position:0%
to make up the difference of the Cabbage
 
04:34:59.029 --> 04:34:59.039 align:start position:0%
of not paying the 35 percent
 
04:35:03.709 --> 04:35:03.719 align:start position:0%
this is I would say a very moderate way
 
04:35:06.709 --> 04:35:06.719 align:start position:0%
of looking at it nobody's coming in and
 
04:35:10.730 --> 04:35:10.740 align:start position:0%
saying re-establish to 35 percent
 
04:35:13.070 --> 04:35:13.080 align:start position:0%
but they're coming in brutally
 
04:35:16.730 --> 04:35:16.740 align:start position:0%
and saying why don't we do a quarter of
 
04:35:19.250 --> 04:35:19.260 align:start position:0%
it 7.5 percent
 
04:35:22.070 --> 04:35:22.080 align:start position:0%
and try to alleviate to cities and towns
 
04:35:24.051 --> 04:35:24.061 align:start position:0%
and that's where the two million dollars
 
04:35:26.029 --> 04:35:26.039 align:start position:0%
for the taxpayers of Nashua will come
 
04:35:28.310 --> 04:35:28.320 align:start position:0%
from let's look at Nashua again we
 
04:35:30.189 --> 04:35:30.199 align:start position:0%
fought the covert battle
 
04:35:31.929 --> 04:35:31.939 align:start position:0%
we have
 
04:35:34.730 --> 04:35:34.740 align:start position:0%
veterans housing we have Workforce
 
04:35:37.490 --> 04:35:37.500 align:start position:0%
housing I'm glad Nashua has brought
 
04:35:39.230 --> 04:35:39.240 align:start position:0%
shoulders to help out people in our
 
04:35:41.390 --> 04:35:41.400 align:start position:0%
communities that are less unfortunate
 
04:35:44.510 --> 04:35:44.520 align:start position:0%
than I am but the thing is it does come
 
04:35:46.490 --> 04:35:46.500 align:start position:0%
and when money's being shipped out to
 
04:35:48.890 --> 04:35:48.900 align:start position:0%
the pension system unnecessarily because
 
04:35:51.890 --> 04:35:51.900 align:start position:0%
what did this really fix really not much
 
04:35:55.070 --> 04:35:55.080 align:start position:0%
I mean look at it who gained from it all
 
04:35:57.051 --> 04:35:57.061 align:start position:0%
you have to do is you're in finance look
 
04:35:58.369 --> 04:35:58.379 align:start position:0%
at the uh
 
04:36:01.730 --> 04:36:01.740 align:start position:0%
the Surplus that the state has right now
 
04:36:04.250 --> 04:36:04.260 align:start position:0%
so therefore you know and then let's
 
04:36:06.590 --> 04:36:06.600 align:start position:0%
look at the Surplus again over the years
 
04:36:08.051 --> 04:36:08.061 align:start position:0%
other great things have happened
 
04:36:10.670 --> 04:36:10.680 align:start position:0%
gambling keno and different other things
 
04:36:13.609 --> 04:36:13.619 align:start position:0%
have added into the Surplus quarters so
 
04:36:15.590 --> 04:36:15.600 align:start position:0%
we're prudently asking seven and a half
 
04:36:17.869 --> 04:36:17.879 align:start position:0%
percent to come through now this was
 
04:36:19.910 --> 04:36:19.920 align:start position:0%
heard last year in the various forms of
 
04:36:22.609 --> 04:36:22.619 align:start position:0%
similar form in the house and it was
 
04:36:22.619 --> 04:36:23.929 align:start position:0%
similar form in the house and it was
passed

04:36:23.929 --> 04:36:23.939 align:start position:0%
passed
 
04:36:26.631 --> 04:36:26.641 align:start position:0%
and it went to the Senate and it passed
 
04:36:29.090 --> 04:36:29.100 align:start position:0%
the Senate except of the difference was
 
04:36:32.689 --> 04:36:32.699 align:start position:0%
being annually disena cut it down to one
 
04:36:35.631 --> 04:36:35.641 align:start position:0%
year and only one year only
 
04:36:38.810 --> 04:36:38.820 align:start position:0%
hey it will it's better than nothing
 
04:36:40.849 --> 04:36:40.859 align:start position:0%
but this would really help the
 
04:36:44.150 --> 04:36:44.160 align:start position:0%
municipalities each cities and towns if
 
04:36:46.609 --> 04:36:46.619 align:start position:0%
this was an annual benefit that they
 
04:36:48.830 --> 04:36:48.840 align:start position:0%
could come on those of you that wear the
 
04:36:51.051 --> 04:36:51.061 align:start position:0%
two hats like I do know when you're
 
04:36:52.910 --> 04:36:52.920 align:start position:0%
trying to do a municipal budget it's
 
04:36:54.590 --> 04:36:54.600 align:start position:0%
very difficult
 
04:36:56.750 --> 04:36:56.760 align:start position:0%
very difficult how much snow we're going
 
04:36:59.150 --> 04:36:59.160 align:start position:0%
to get what type of plow truck needs to
 
04:37:01.310 --> 04:37:01.320 align:start position:0%
be replacing a fire truck or something
 
04:37:04.551 --> 04:37:04.561 align:start position:0%
like that out of Capital Improvements at
 
04:37:06.830 --> 04:37:06.840 align:start position:0%
least this will get this going pretty
 
04:37:09.949 --> 04:37:09.959 align:start position:0%
quickly and something that you know you
 
04:37:12.109 --> 04:37:12.119 align:start position:0%
can count on with that
 
04:37:14.869 --> 04:37:14.879 align:start position:0%
so in essence I'm going to wrap it up at
 
04:37:16.849 --> 04:37:16.859 align:start position:0%
that you know and take any type of
 
04:37:20.029 --> 04:37:20.039 align:start position:0%
questions but I would like this that has
 
04:37:21.709 --> 04:37:21.719 align:start position:0%
a positive I would like to see a
 
04:37:24.709 --> 04:37:24.719 align:start position:0%
positive recommendation not on my behalf
 
04:37:27.230 --> 04:37:27.240 align:start position:0%
but this should be fully vetted by all
 
04:37:30.890 --> 04:37:30.900 align:start position:0%
members of the House on the floor and to
 
04:37:33.051 --> 04:37:33.061 align:start position:0%
come up and exactly what happened in the
 
04:37:36.131 --> 04:37:36.141 align:start position:0%
last session and overwhelming support
 
04:37:39.849 --> 04:37:39.859 align:start position:0%
this this bill here of
 
04:37:42.170 --> 04:37:42.180 align:start position:0%
Genesis of what happened in the last
 
04:37:45.949 --> 04:37:45.959 align:start position:0%
term the last term Bill had bipartisan
 
04:37:45.959 --> 04:37:48.109 align:start position:0%
term the last term Bill had bipartisan
support

04:37:48.109 --> 04:37:48.119 align:start position:0%
support
 
04:37:50.330 --> 04:37:50.340 align:start position:0%
it made it to the Senate
 
04:37:52.070 --> 04:37:52.080 align:start position:0%
and I feel
 
04:37:54.650 --> 04:37:54.660 align:start position:0%
in my heart that if you support this
 
04:37:57.230 --> 04:37:57.240 align:start position:0%
bill this will again will come up with a
 
04:37:58.910 --> 04:37:58.920 align:start position:0%
positive recommendation from the floor
 
04:38:02.029 --> 04:38:02.039 align:start position:0%
and make it over to the Senate side to
 
04:38:04.429 --> 04:38:04.439 align:start position:0%
be determined so at that I'll end my
 
04:38:07.131 --> 04:38:07.141 align:start position:0%
comments and available for uh any type
 
04:38:10.369 --> 04:38:10.379 align:start position:0%
of questions if you may have them
 
04:38:12.470 --> 04:38:12.480 align:start position:0%
any questions on the committee
 
04:38:14.269 --> 04:38:14.279 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards
 
04:38:16.970 --> 04:38:16.980 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and uh thank you
 
04:38:21.670 --> 04:38:21.680 align:start position:0%
representative O'Brien I I'm I'm I'm not
 
04:38:25.010 --> 04:38:25.020 align:start position:0%
a real academic when it comes to the
 
04:38:27.949 --> 04:38:27.959 align:start position:0%
retirement system so I'm going to share
 
04:38:29.810 --> 04:38:29.820 align:start position:0%
with you something I've heard hallway
 
04:38:33.529 --> 04:38:33.539 align:start position:0%
banter some paranoia and let you educate
 
04:38:37.551 --> 04:38:37.561 align:start position:0%
me what what I've heard is that the
 
04:38:39.830 --> 04:38:39.840 align:start position:0%
concern is if we were to take Nashville
 
04:38:42.170 --> 04:38:42.180 align:start position:0%
just as your example you've offered them
 
04:38:46.551 --> 04:38:46.561 align:start position:0%
and the state went ahead and filled in
 
04:38:49.490 --> 04:38:49.500 align:start position:0%
that two million dollar hole or whatever
 
04:38:50.990 --> 04:38:51.000 align:start position:0%
is being spent
 
04:38:54.470 --> 04:38:54.480 align:start position:0%
that Nashua would likely take that 2
 
04:38:56.631 --> 04:38:56.641 align:start position:0%
million and increase spending elsewhere
 
04:39:00.109 --> 04:39:00.119 align:start position:0%
and that the new spending would be done
 
04:39:02.990 --> 04:39:03.000 align:start position:0%
in a way in which the state legislature
 
04:39:06.650 --> 04:39:06.660 align:start position:0%
would have no influence and so we would
 
04:39:09.289 --> 04:39:09.299 align:start position:0%
basically the the fear and then I'm just
 
04:39:11.631 --> 04:39:11.641 align:start position:0%
looking for how you react to this is the
 
04:39:14.209 --> 04:39:14.219 align:start position:0%
the fear is that this money is basically
 
04:39:17.810 --> 04:39:17.820 align:start position:0%
you know bankrolling more local spending
 
04:39:20.750 --> 04:39:20.760 align:start position:0%
that by and large the state would have
 
04:39:23.209 --> 04:39:23.219 align:start position:0%
no voice in
 
04:39:26.390 --> 04:39:26.400 align:start position:0%
well you got to remember uh let's look
 
04:39:31.189 --> 04:39:31.199 align:start position:0%
historically at it prior to 2011 was
 
04:39:33.470 --> 04:39:33.480 align:start position:0%
that the case
 
04:39:36.590 --> 04:39:36.600 align:start position:0%
you know in other words this change came
 
04:39:38.448 --> 04:39:38.458 align:start position:0%
in 2011.
 
04:39:42.110 --> 04:39:42.120 align:start position:0%
so prior to 2011 there wasn't uh you
 
04:39:44.390 --> 04:39:44.400 align:start position:0%
know any great parties being thrown down
 
04:39:46.610 --> 04:39:46.620 align:start position:0%
at City Hall or anything else like that
 
04:39:49.670 --> 04:39:49.680 align:start position:0%
and I say that lightly but it's not just
 
04:39:52.910 --> 04:39:52.920 align:start position:0%
Nashua and I would like to say I'm sure
 
04:39:55.130 --> 04:39:55.140 align:start position:0%
that Catherine miss Catherine heck of
 
04:39:57.230 --> 04:39:57.240 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Municipal Association
 
04:39:59.690 --> 04:39:59.700 align:start position:0%
which does support this I got this she
 
04:40:01.610 --> 04:40:01.620 align:start position:0%
from the last time I fought this
 
04:40:03.050 --> 04:40:03.060 align:start position:0%
familiar battle
 
04:40:05.270 --> 04:40:05.280 align:start position:0%
Nashville is only one of the cities and
 
04:40:06.830 --> 04:40:06.840 align:start position:0%
towns that are involved with this this
 
04:40:09.050 --> 04:40:09.060 align:start position:0%
many others that will economically
 
04:40:11.510 --> 04:40:11.520 align:start position:0%
benefit from this so if you ask the
 
04:40:13.610 --> 04:40:13.620 align:start position:0%
question in the example of Nashua it's
 
04:40:16.070 --> 04:40:16.080 align:start position:0%
true for a lot of political subdivisions
 
04:40:19.788 --> 04:40:19.798 align:start position:0%
within the state now again is there some
 
04:40:21.470 --> 04:40:21.480 align:start position:0%
things in Nashua that needs attention
 
04:40:24.590 --> 04:40:24.600 align:start position:0%
yeah Welcome to our budget process every
 
04:40:26.510 --> 04:40:26.520 align:start position:0%
single year I have to I sit on the
 
04:40:28.788 --> 04:40:28.798 align:start position:0%
budget committee I have to sit down and
 
04:40:30.530 --> 04:40:30.540 align:start position:0%
pick and choose in certain things that
 
04:40:32.810 --> 04:40:32.820 align:start position:0%
need to be done can we get another year
 
04:40:34.730 --> 04:40:34.740 align:start position:0%
out of that pickup truck
 
04:40:36.170 --> 04:40:36.180 align:start position:0%
or not
 
04:40:37.788 --> 04:40:37.798 align:start position:0%
you know when we look at the Capital
 
04:40:39.890 --> 04:40:39.900 align:start position:0%
Improvements we looked at many other
 
04:40:41.750 --> 04:40:41.760 align:start position:0%
different things such as in Nashville
 
04:40:44.150 --> 04:40:44.160 align:start position:0%
we're very prudent with a dollar I have
 
04:40:47.270 --> 04:40:47.280 align:start position:0%
to say we've looked at bonding maybe the
 
04:40:49.368 --> 04:40:49.378 align:start position:0%
station look at bonding but we looked at
 
04:40:52.070 --> 04:40:52.080 align:start position:0%
bonding as an issue to purchase a fire
 
04:40:53.750 --> 04:40:53.760 align:start position:0%
truck they're going for about a half a
 
04:40:55.670 --> 04:40:55.680 align:start position:0%
million dollars plus
 
04:40:58.070 --> 04:40:58.080 align:start position:0%
and we'll Bond over the life of that
 
04:40:59.810 --> 04:40:59.820 align:start position:0%
vehicle and it turns out to work pretty
 
04:41:02.650 --> 04:41:02.660 align:start position:0%
good and natural I'll have you say
 
04:41:06.350 --> 04:41:06.360 align:start position:0%
I'm very proud of it fiscally we have a
 
04:41:10.250 --> 04:41:10.260 align:start position:0%
from standard and poor AAA Bond rating
 
04:41:12.948 --> 04:41:12.958 align:start position:0%
that's pretty good and done good for any
 
04:41:15.708 --> 04:41:15.718 align:start position:0%
municipality and may I also say to
 
04:41:15.718 --> 04:41:16.910 align:start position:0%
municipality and may I also say to
reverb

04:41:16.910 --> 04:41:16.920 align:start position:0%
reverb
 
04:41:19.550 --> 04:41:19.560 align:start position:0%
back to reserve back to what I say with
 
04:41:21.650 --> 04:41:21.660 align:start position:0%
the pension system I forgot to mention
 
04:41:24.470 --> 04:41:24.480 align:start position:0%
our Board of Public Works they chose at
 
04:41:27.470 --> 04:41:27.480 align:start position:0%
that particular time not to get into the
 
04:41:29.868 --> 04:41:29.878 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire retirement system I said
 
04:41:32.690 --> 04:41:32.700 align:start position:0%
on that board as well too that pension
 
04:41:37.670 --> 04:41:37.680 align:start position:0%
board is 87 percent funded
 
04:41:39.410 --> 04:41:39.420 align:start position:0%
how come naturally can do it in the
 
04:41:41.570 --> 04:41:41.580 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire can't
 
04:41:45.170 --> 04:41:45.180 align:start position:0%
again it's 400 people sticking their
 
04:41:48.170 --> 04:41:48.180 align:start position:0%
fingers in the pot did you know in your
 
04:41:49.970 --> 04:41:49.980 align:start position:0%
time when you grew up
 
04:41:52.910 --> 04:41:52.920 align:start position:0%
when you had the Odin update myself but
 
04:41:54.948 --> 04:41:54.958 align:start position:0%
you remembered the old uh whatever they
 
04:41:57.410 --> 04:41:57.420 align:start position:0%
used to call that the Christmas he used
 
04:41:59.270 --> 04:41:59.280 align:start position:0%
to put money away for Christmas and you
 
04:42:01.010 --> 04:42:01.020 align:start position:0%
save it well you know if you didn't make
 
04:42:02.628 --> 04:42:02.638 align:start position:0%
the money the kids didn't get the toys
 
04:42:04.550 --> 04:42:04.560 align:start position:0%
for Christmas this is the same thing
 
04:42:06.288 --> 04:42:06.298 align:start position:0%
with the pension system that money
 
04:42:08.208 --> 04:42:08.218 align:start position:0%
should have been away properly invested
 
04:42:10.850 --> 04:42:10.860 align:start position:0%
and should not have been played with and
 
04:42:13.190 --> 04:42:13.200 align:start position:0%
to leave it alone and again we're paying
 
04:42:15.890 --> 04:42:15.900 align:start position:0%
for that mistake in the past I I know I
 
04:42:17.570 --> 04:42:17.580 align:start position:0%
over answered your question so I
 
04:42:17.580 --> 04:42:20.050 align:start position:0%
over answered your question so I
apologize

04:42:20.050 --> 04:42:20.060 align:start position:0%
apologize
 
04:42:22.610 --> 04:42:22.620 align:start position:0%
oh absolutely
 
04:42:25.550 --> 04:42:25.560 align:start position:0%
so thank you so so the way I'm going to
 
04:42:27.410 --> 04:42:27.420 align:start position:0%
store your answer and you can correct me
 
04:42:30.530 --> 04:42:30.540 align:start position:0%
if I've got this wrong is that if if in
 
04:42:33.350 --> 04:42:33.360 align:start position:0%
the case of City acts which may be
 
04:42:35.810 --> 04:42:35.820 align:start position:0%
Nashua that we may help with the two
 
04:42:38.810 --> 04:42:38.820 align:start position:0%
million dollars then yes there are high
 
04:42:41.030 --> 04:42:41.040 align:start position:0%
priority spending needs that aren't
 
04:42:43.970 --> 04:42:43.980 align:start position:0%
currently being met that Nashville would
 
04:42:46.730 --> 04:42:46.740 align:start position:0%
identify and probably spend some portion
 
04:42:48.770 --> 04:42:48.780 align:start position:0%
of the two million dollars on that
 
04:42:50.868 --> 04:42:50.878 align:start position:0%
that's what I think I heard you say I
 
04:42:52.788 --> 04:42:52.798 align:start position:0%
don't want to assume that that's what
 
04:42:54.890 --> 04:42:54.900 align:start position:0%
you meant why yeah I cannot guarantee
 
04:42:57.350 --> 04:42:57.360 align:start position:0%
that some of that money may go to some
 
04:43:00.230 --> 04:43:00.240 align:start position:0%
other funds to assist but you explain I
 
04:43:02.270 --> 04:43:02.280 align:start position:0%
would ask the question but I cannot ask
 
04:43:05.570 --> 04:43:05.580 align:start position:0%
and nor to debate and not intending so
 
04:43:09.288 --> 04:43:09.298 align:start position:0%
but in the i in my Irish form I will say
 
04:43:13.128 --> 04:43:13.138 align:start position:0%
what is wrong idealistically with the
 
04:43:15.110 --> 04:43:15.120 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire helping out its
 
04:43:20.868 --> 04:43:20.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:24.470 --> 04:43:24.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:25.970 --> 04:43:25.980 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for your time oh would I
 
04:43:27.650 --> 04:43:27.660 align:start position:0%
miss one
 
04:43:29.470 --> 04:43:29.480 align:start position:0%
are you sure
 
04:43:32.090 --> 04:43:32.100 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony well thank
 
04:43:33.470 --> 04:43:33.480 align:start position:0%
you very much and thank you for having
 
04:43:36.650 --> 04:43:36.660 align:start position:0%
me and I'm going back to uh to see the
 
04:43:39.470 --> 04:43:39.480 align:start position:0%
other representative McGuire now to
 
04:43:42.788 --> 04:43:42.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:51.410 --> 04:43:51.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:04.368 --> 04:44:04.378 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:04.378 --> 04:44:06.530 align:start position:0%
 
oh

04:44:06.530 --> 04:44:06.540 align:start position:0%
oh
 
04:44:08.390 --> 04:44:08.400 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman members of the
 
04:44:08.400 --> 04:44:10.788 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman members of the
committee

04:44:10.788 --> 04:44:10.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:13.610 --> 04:44:13.620 align:start position:0%
I oppose this bill
 
04:44:16.670 --> 04:44:16.680 align:start position:0%
it puts in Jeopardy all the work
 
04:44:18.770 --> 04:44:18.780 align:start position:0%
that this committee does to create a
 
04:44:18.780 --> 04:44:19.610 align:start position:0%
that this committee does to create a
budget

04:44:19.610 --> 04:44:19.620 align:start position:0%
budget
 
04:44:21.890 --> 04:44:21.900 align:start position:0%
that will sustain our state for two
 
04:44:25.430 --> 04:44:25.440 align:start position:0%
years and we do this three months before
 
04:44:27.530 --> 04:44:27.540 align:start position:0%
the biennium begins
 
04:44:30.170 --> 04:44:30.180 align:start position:0%
we can safely say that the revenue that
 
04:44:31.490 --> 04:44:31.500 align:start position:0%
our budget depends on has been
 
04:44:33.890 --> 04:44:33.900 align:start position:0%
accurately forecast by Ways and Means
 
04:44:36.350 --> 04:44:36.360 align:start position:0%
for the last several biennia
 
04:44:38.510 --> 04:44:38.520 align:start position:0%
we then make a budget that stays within
 
04:44:40.390 --> 04:44:40.400 align:start position:0%
that revenue forecast
 
04:44:43.250 --> 04:44:43.260 align:start position:0%
this bill proposes spending that this
 
04:44:46.070 --> 04:44:46.080 align:start position:0%
legislature has absolutely no control
 
04:44:46.080 --> 04:44:47.510 align:start position:0%
legislature has absolutely no control
over

04:44:47.510 --> 04:44:47.520 align:start position:0%
over
 
04:44:49.850 --> 04:44:49.860 align:start position:0%
yet requires us to make those payments
 
04:44:49.860 --> 04:44:51.288 align:start position:0%
yet requires us to make those payments
regardless

04:44:51.288 --> 04:44:51.298 align:start position:0%
regardless
 
04:44:53.570 --> 04:44:53.580 align:start position:0%
I cannot accept this for responsible
 
04:44:53.580 --> 04:44:54.948 align:start position:0%
I cannot accept this for responsible
budgeting

04:44:54.948 --> 04:44:54.958 align:start position:0%
budgeting
 
04:44:57.050 --> 04:44:57.060 align:start position:0%
nor can I accept this
 
04:45:00.830 --> 04:45:00.840 align:start position:0%
constant claim you promised you promised
 
04:45:02.930 --> 04:45:02.940 align:start position:0%
we always say that the promise is only
 
04:45:05.810 --> 04:45:05.820 align:start position:0%
as good as the present biennium budget
 
04:45:08.270 --> 04:45:08.280 align:start position:0%
nothing goes beyond that unless it's a
 
04:45:08.280 --> 04:45:09.288 align:start position:0%
nothing goes beyond that unless it's a
bond

04:45:09.288 --> 04:45:09.298 align:start position:0%
bond
 
04:45:11.208 --> 04:45:11.218 align:start position:0%
what we decide to spend in this next
 
04:45:13.788 --> 04:45:13.798 align:start position:0%
budget that's what we spend and we can
 
04:45:15.170 --> 04:45:15.180 align:start position:0%
tell every other
 
04:45:17.510 --> 04:45:17.520 align:start position:0%
agency in this state that uses our money
 
04:45:19.610 --> 04:45:19.620 align:start position:0%
this is all you can spend
 
04:45:21.350 --> 04:45:21.360 align:start position:0%
if there's some Surplus and they come
 
04:45:23.330 --> 04:45:23.340 align:start position:0%
back to us later maybe we give them more
 
04:45:25.190 --> 04:45:25.200 align:start position:0%
money but this doesn't even allow us
 
04:45:28.010 --> 04:45:28.020 align:start position:0%
that option whatever it costs that's
 
04:45:30.410 --> 04:45:30.420 align:start position:0%
what it is
 
04:45:32.690 --> 04:45:32.700 align:start position:0%
ten years ago I was responsible in this
 
04:45:34.490 --> 04:45:34.500 align:start position:0%
finance committee when we had to cut the
 
04:45:34.500 --> 04:45:36.288 align:start position:0%
finance committee when we had to cut the
budget

04:45:36.288 --> 04:45:36.298 align:start position:0%
budget
 
04:45:37.788 --> 04:45:37.798 align:start position:0%
10 percent
 
04:45:40.550 --> 04:45:40.560 align:start position:0%
to look at what was happening with this
 
04:45:43.970 --> 04:45:43.980 align:start position:0%
contribution to municipality retirements
 
04:45:46.670 --> 04:45:46.680 align:start position:0%
they had grown like crazy
 
04:45:49.128 --> 04:45:49.138 align:start position:0%
we hear about oh you promised in 68.
 
04:45:51.830 --> 04:45:51.840 align:start position:0%
well I remember in 70 when small towns
 
04:45:53.990 --> 04:45:54.000 align:start position:0%
like mine and the one next to us had no
 
04:45:56.270 --> 04:45:56.280 align:start position:0%
people in this Retirement System
 
04:45:56.280 --> 04:45:57.590 align:start position:0%
people in this Retirement System
nobody

04:45:57.590 --> 04:45:57.600 align:start position:0%
nobody
 
04:45:59.570 --> 04:45:59.580 align:start position:0%
we began to hire people in the 70s for
 
04:46:02.390 --> 04:46:02.400 align:start position:0%
full-time jobs that didn't exist when
 
04:46:04.910 --> 04:46:04.920 align:start position:0%
this agreement was first made to bring
 
04:46:06.410 --> 04:46:06.420 align:start position:0%
everybody into it there were very few
 
04:46:10.670 --> 04:46:10.680 align:start position:0%
employees so at the time we decided to
 
04:46:13.190 --> 04:46:13.200 align:start position:0%
take it out of the budget in the 1213
 
04:46:13.200 --> 04:46:14.510 align:start position:0%
take it out of the budget in the 1213
budget

04:46:14.510 --> 04:46:14.520 align:start position:0%
budget
 
04:46:17.448 --> 04:46:17.458 align:start position:0%
it was going to be 60 million dollars
 
04:46:18.948 --> 04:46:18.958 align:start position:0%
if you
 
04:46:22.190 --> 04:46:22.200 align:start position:0%
projected this cost for seven and a half
 
04:46:24.948 --> 04:46:24.958 align:start position:0%
percent it would now be 124 million in
 
04:46:26.208 --> 04:46:26.218 align:start position:0%
10 years
 
04:46:29.090 --> 04:46:29.100 align:start position:0%
can we afford this kind of increase year
 
04:46:32.330 --> 04:46:32.340 align:start position:0%
over year that we have no control over
 
04:46:34.310 --> 04:46:34.320 align:start position:0%
that's not the way we can make a budget
 
04:46:36.288 --> 04:46:36.298 align:start position:0%
we can decide to give the money year
 
04:46:37.970 --> 04:46:37.980 align:start position:0%
after year
 
04:46:37.980 --> 04:46:40.190 align:start position:0%
after year
but

04:46:40.190 --> 04:46:40.200 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:46:43.010 --> 04:46:43.020 align:start position:0%
we do that in a specific amount this is
 
04:46:46.368 --> 04:46:46.378 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:48.650 --> 04:46:48.660 align:start position:0%
and there were two things that I'm
 
04:46:50.390 --> 04:46:50.400 align:start position:0%
delighted to see thank you for the
 
04:46:52.490 --> 04:46:52.500 align:start position:0%
municipal Association you all got mail
 
04:46:52.500 --> 04:46:53.930 align:start position:0%
municipal Association you all got mail
this

04:46:53.930 --> 04:46:53.940 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:46:57.050 --> 04:46:57.060 align:start position:0%
it tells you in the back on page 23 the
 
04:47:02.270 --> 04:47:02.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:04.490 --> 04:47:04.500 align:start position:0%
so two troubling obvious
 
04:47:06.830 --> 04:47:06.840 align:start position:0%
misrepresentations in this bill
 
04:47:08.810 --> 04:47:08.820 align:start position:0%
first we know that is only a foot in the
 
04:47:11.150 --> 04:47:11.160 align:start position:0%
door attempt to raising the rate of
 
04:47:13.610 --> 04:47:13.620 align:start position:0%
contribution to 35 percent that existed
 
04:47:16.610 --> 04:47:16.620 align:start position:0%
before 2010. and I will remind you again
 
04:47:19.310 --> 04:47:19.320 align:start position:0%
all this crying about oh you raised the
 
04:47:22.490 --> 04:47:22.500 align:start position:0%
property taxes by doing that no we
 
04:47:26.448 --> 04:47:26.458 align:start position:0%
raised the contribution by the employee
 
04:47:29.030 --> 04:47:29.040 align:start position:0%
by two percent you heard that admitted
 
04:47:32.090 --> 04:47:32.100 align:start position:0%
by representative O'Brien we raised by
 
04:47:34.010 --> 04:47:34.020 align:start position:0%
two percent and a little bit more for
 
04:47:36.050 --> 04:47:36.060 align:start position:0%
the firemen and the police
 
04:47:40.368 --> 04:47:40.378 align:start position:0%
as it stands still even at 11.8 Pi 11.8
 
04:47:42.590 --> 04:47:42.600 align:start position:0%
of whatever he's contributing
 
04:47:44.390 --> 04:47:44.400 align:start position:0%
his the
 
04:47:44.400 --> 04:47:46.368 align:start position:0%
his the
Firehouse

04:47:46.368 --> 04:47:46.378 align:start position:0%
Firehouse
 
04:47:50.150 --> 04:47:50.160 align:start position:0%
the town is contributing like 19 or 20
 
04:47:53.030 --> 04:47:53.040 align:start position:0%
percent now most Retirement Systems that
 
04:47:56.270 --> 04:47:56.280 align:start position:0%
you know about you are fortunate if the
 
04:47:59.270 --> 04:47:59.280 align:start position:0%
employer matches what the employee puts
 
04:48:01.490 --> 04:48:01.500 align:start position:0%
in we're putting in most cases two and a
 
04:48:03.050 --> 04:48:03.060 align:start position:0%
half times
 
04:48:05.030 --> 04:48:05.040 align:start position:0%
that's not reasonable
 
04:48:07.910 --> 04:48:07.920 align:start position:0%
I think if the retirement system is in
 
04:48:10.010 --> 04:48:10.020 align:start position:0%
trouble and we've passed bills in 2011
 
04:48:12.050 --> 04:48:12.060 align:start position:0%
to try to fix it
 
04:48:14.208 --> 04:48:14.218 align:start position:0%
it was a two billion dollar deficit in
 
04:48:18.350 --> 04:48:18.360 align:start position:0%
2011 when we did that now it's 5.7 how
 
04:48:21.170 --> 04:48:21.180 align:start position:0%
did that work out yes the 400 people in
 
04:48:23.810 --> 04:48:23.820 align:start position:0%
this house because they keep changing it
 
04:48:27.830 --> 04:48:27.840 align:start position:0%
to make it worse as far as the money in
 
04:48:30.470 --> 04:48:30.480 align:start position:0%
that in that fund because oh no we're
 
04:48:31.730 --> 04:48:31.740 align:start position:0%
not going to make the rules that we put
 
04:48:33.770 --> 04:48:33.780 align:start position:0%
in 2011 to fix this we don't like them
 
04:48:35.448 --> 04:48:35.458 align:start position:0%
because these people are upset by those
 
04:48:37.310 --> 04:48:37.320 align:start position:0%
rules so we're going to change them okay
 
04:48:39.170 --> 04:48:39.180 align:start position:0%
so we're never going to catch up with
 
04:48:42.110 --> 04:48:42.120 align:start position:0%
the deficit and it will continue to grow
 
04:48:44.750 --> 04:48:44.760 align:start position:0%
but taking this money
 
04:48:47.330 --> 04:48:47.340 align:start position:0%
from our other funds and putting it
 
04:48:49.550 --> 04:48:49.560 align:start position:0%
toward the towns and trying to make it
 
04:48:51.590 --> 04:48:51.600 align:start position:0%
forever or even to raise the 35 percent
 
04:48:53.868 --> 04:48:53.878 align:start position:0%
is going to make a headache for every
 
04:48:53.878 --> 04:48:55.788 align:start position:0%
is going to make a headache for every
future

04:48:55.788 --> 04:48:55.798 align:start position:0%
future
 
04:48:57.948 --> 04:48:57.958 align:start position:0%
finance committee that's coming after us
 
04:49:00.770 --> 04:49:00.780 align:start position:0%
because it's totally unpredictable we're
 
04:49:02.150 --> 04:49:02.160 align:start position:0%
coming around to hear everybody saying
 
04:49:03.830 --> 04:49:03.840 align:start position:0%
well we ought to raise all the employees
 
04:49:06.410 --> 04:49:06.420 align:start position:0%
eight nine ten percent because of
 
04:49:06.420 --> 04:49:07.850 align:start position:0%
eight nine ten percent because of
inflation

04:49:07.850 --> 04:49:07.860 align:start position:0%
inflation
 
04:49:09.470 --> 04:49:09.480 align:start position:0%
what's that going to do that's also
 
04:49:10.850 --> 04:49:10.860 align:start position:0%
going to raise the contribution the
 
04:49:11.990 --> 04:49:12.000 align:start position:0%
state makes
 
04:49:14.150 --> 04:49:14.160 align:start position:0%
if the state has to make that and it's
 
04:49:16.368 --> 04:49:16.378 align:start position:0%
unpredictable we know how much we'll
 
04:49:18.530 --> 04:49:18.540 align:start position:0%
have in this budget if we have to raise
 
04:49:22.128 --> 04:49:22.138 align:start position:0%
money to pay our employees and we'll put
 
04:49:23.330 --> 04:49:23.340 align:start position:0%
it in the budget and we'll find the
 
04:49:25.010 --> 04:49:25.020 align:start position:0%
money and we'll have to make reductions
 
04:49:26.868 --> 04:49:26.878 align:start position:0%
elsewhere but
 
04:49:29.990 --> 04:49:30.000 align:start position:0%
I'm offended very much by property tax
 
04:49:34.070 --> 04:49:34.080 align:start position:0%
reduction act what a joke
 
04:49:37.850 --> 04:49:37.860 align:start position:0%
we're given 1.3 billion back to the
 
04:49:37.860 --> 04:49:38.810 align:start position:0%
we're given 1.3 billion back to the
towns

04:49:38.810 --> 04:49:38.820 align:start position:0%
towns
 
04:49:41.690 --> 04:49:41.700 align:start position:0%
this is going to give 27 million
 
04:49:43.850 --> 04:49:43.860 align:start position:0%
a drop in the bucket
 
04:49:46.128 --> 04:49:46.138 align:start position:0%
on your budget on your property taxes
 
04:49:48.230 --> 04:49:48.240 align:start position:0%
here you'll have a hundred million off
 
04:49:50.270 --> 04:49:50.280 align:start position:0%
of the swept tax
 
04:49:52.010 --> 04:49:52.020 align:start position:0%
I'm thinking that's going to amount to a
 
04:49:54.530 --> 04:49:54.540 align:start position:0%
couple hundred dollars per tax bill
 
04:49:56.810 --> 04:49:56.820 align:start position:0%
for the average tax bill
 
04:49:59.628 --> 04:49:59.638 align:start position:0%
this would amount to maybe a fourth of
 
04:50:02.150 --> 04:50:02.160 align:start position:0%
that maybe fifty dollars
 
04:50:04.010 --> 04:50:04.020 align:start position:0%
for the average tax bill you think
 
04:50:05.208 --> 04:50:05.218 align:start position:0%
anybody's going to get excited about
 
04:50:05.218 --> 04:50:06.230 align:start position:0%
anybody's going to get excited about
that

04:50:06.230 --> 04:50:06.240 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:50:08.270 --> 04:50:08.280 align:start position:0%
that's going to be lost in rounding and
 
04:50:10.550 --> 04:50:10.560 align:start position:0%
normal tax increases you'll never see
 
04:50:12.170 --> 04:50:12.180 align:start position:0%
that reduction
 
04:50:14.390 --> 04:50:14.400 align:start position:0%
it's not enough to make a fuss about and
 
04:50:18.170 --> 04:50:18.180 align:start position:0%
put in a bill and tell lies about oh you
 
04:50:21.050 --> 04:50:21.060 align:start position:0%
promised or you stole it
 
04:50:23.510 --> 04:50:23.520 align:start position:0%
they forget that the difference in in
 
04:50:28.970 --> 04:50:28.980 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:32.270 --> 04:50:32.280 align:start position:0%
made up the loss to the towns by the
 
04:50:32.280 --> 04:50:33.770 align:start position:0%
made up the loss to the towns by the
employee

04:50:33.770 --> 04:50:33.780 align:start position:0%
employee
 
04:50:36.530 --> 04:50:36.540 align:start position:0%
so if you look at this this will tell
 
04:50:39.410 --> 04:50:39.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:42.708 --> 04:50:42.718 align:start position:0%
of Revenue sharing from the state to the
 
04:50:45.590 --> 04:50:45.600 align:start position:0%
towns it's growing growing growing it's
 
04:50:49.128 --> 04:50:49.138 align:start position:0%
been 1.3 billion like I say in here
 
04:50:51.050 --> 04:50:51.060 align:start position:0%

on another 15 million
 
04:51:08.750 --> 04:51:08.760 align:start position:0%
are they unaware of this when they claim
 
04:51:11.150 --> 04:51:11.160 align:start position:0%
this is the property tax reduction act
 
04:51:13.010 --> 04:51:13.020 align:start position:0%
this is a joke
 
04:51:16.310 --> 04:51:16.320 align:start position:0%
vote no totally unnecessary it destroys
 
04:51:18.530 --> 04:51:18.540 align:start position:0%
all the work that we try to do as a
 
04:51:20.208 --> 04:51:20.218 align:start position:0%
finance committee I'll be happy to take
 
04:51:22.128 --> 04:51:22.138 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
04:51:24.110 --> 04:51:24.120 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for the testimony any
 
04:51:24.120 --> 04:51:25.550 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for the testimony any
questions

04:51:25.550 --> 04:51:25.560 align:start position:0%
questions
 
04:51:28.310 --> 04:51:28.320 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards uh think thank
 
04:51:33.948 --> 04:51:33.958 align:start position:0%
you Mr Mr chair but um so so in in your
 
04:51:36.910 --> 04:51:36.920 align:start position:0%
testimony you you
 
04:51:40.430 --> 04:51:40.440 align:start position:0%
use the word lies I I I don't think you
 
04:51:42.410 --> 04:51:42.420 align:start position:0%
intended to impugn the motives or
 
04:51:45.170 --> 04:51:45.180 align:start position:0%
Integrity of any of the sponsors so do
 
04:51:47.030 --> 04:51:47.040 align:start position:0%
you do do you want to do you want to
 
04:51:49.010 --> 04:51:49.020 align:start position:0%
clarify that sir I take it back thank
 
04:51:51.170 --> 04:51:51.180 align:start position:0%
you for that it's a misrepresentation
 
04:51:52.970 --> 04:51:52.980 align:start position:0%
are we all have different opinions on
 
04:51:55.070 --> 04:51:55.080 align:start position:0%
what things move different ways and I
 
04:51:56.990 --> 04:51:57.000 align:start position:0%
think more of us here know what happens
 
04:51:58.730 --> 04:51:58.740 align:start position:0%
economically when we move things around
 
04:52:00.590 --> 04:52:00.600 align:start position:0%
the budget other members that are not
 
04:52:02.150 --> 04:52:02.160 align:start position:0%
involved in the budget may not know as
 
04:52:04.250 --> 04:52:04.260 align:start position:0%
much thank you yes sir thank you for
 
04:52:07.190 --> 04:52:07.200 align:start position:0%
that I I know you and I I don't I I knew
 
04:52:09.050 --> 04:52:09.060 align:start position:0%
that you didn't intend to do that so
 
04:52:13.128 --> 04:52:13.138 align:start position:0%
then my real question uh if I may is
 
04:52:14.868 --> 04:52:14.878 align:start position:0%
um as I as I look at the retirement
 
04:52:16.550 --> 04:52:16.560 align:start position:0%
system this is now the beginning of my
 
04:52:19.430 --> 04:52:19.440 align:start position:0%
fourth term I have no clue why New
 
04:52:21.708 --> 04:52:21.718 align:start position:0%
Hampshire hasn't done what the rest of
 
04:52:24.110 --> 04:52:24.120 align:start position:0%
the United States has done by moving
 
04:52:26.810 --> 04:52:26.820 align:start position:0%
away from a defined benefit retirement
 
04:52:30.470 --> 04:52:30.480 align:start position:0%
program and moving into a 401k kind of
 
04:52:32.030 --> 04:52:32.040 align:start position:0%
arrangement or whatever the right
 
04:52:34.070 --> 04:52:34.080 align:start position:0%
letters are for the government
 
04:52:37.788 --> 04:52:37.798 align:start position:0%
equivalent 401b or I don't know so
 
04:52:40.788 --> 04:52:40.798 align:start position:0%
because you have so much history on this
 
04:52:43.250 --> 04:52:43.260 align:start position:0%
could you could you please educate
 
04:52:47.750 --> 04:52:47.760 align:start position:0%
people on what has been the problem with
 
04:52:50.208 --> 04:52:50.218 align:start position:0%
doing the obvious that all the other
 
04:52:54.650 --> 04:52:54.660 align:start position:0%
states are doing uh going from Define
 
04:52:58.490 --> 04:52:58.500 align:start position:0%
benefit retirement to a contributory
 
04:53:02.270 --> 04:53:02.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:05.930 --> 04:53:05.940 align:start position:0%
well I would say it's the unions they
 
04:53:07.490 --> 04:53:07.500 align:start position:0%
can generate hundreds of phone calls and
 
04:53:07.500 --> 04:53:08.390 align:start position:0%
can generate hundreds of phone calls and
letters

04:53:08.390 --> 04:53:08.400 align:start position:0%
letters
 
04:53:10.610 --> 04:53:10.620 align:start position:0%
they don't ever look at it economically
 
04:53:12.770 --> 04:53:12.780 align:start position:0%
they just look at what they want
 
04:53:15.948 --> 04:53:15.958 align:start position:0%
and we have a lot of Republicans that
 
04:53:17.270 --> 04:53:17.280 align:start position:0%
will go along with it and a lot of
 
04:53:18.590 --> 04:53:18.600 align:start position:0%
Democrats that will go along with the
 
04:53:21.110 --> 04:53:21.120 align:start position:0%
unions so they end up getting a majority
 
04:53:23.330 --> 04:53:23.340 align:start position:0%
in cases even when the Republicans have
 
04:53:25.670 --> 04:53:25.680 align:start position:0%
the majority they get a majority that
 
04:53:27.530 --> 04:53:27.540 align:start position:0%
Tinkers with the retirement system
 
04:53:29.510 --> 04:53:29.520 align:start position:0%
because the union thinks it's to their
 
04:53:33.350 --> 04:53:33.360 align:start position:0%
advantage and obviously if we're now 5.7
 
04:53:35.750 --> 04:53:35.760 align:start position:0%
billion in the whole from 2 billion 10
 
04:53:38.868 --> 04:53:38.878 align:start position:0%
years ago that tinkering has not been to
 
04:53:40.550 --> 04:53:40.560 align:start position:0%
the advantage
 
04:53:42.230 --> 04:53:42.240 align:start position:0%
of the Union people
 
04:53:46.010 --> 04:53:46.020 align:start position:0%
what I foresee is at some point since
 
04:53:48.650 --> 04:53:48.660 align:start position:0%
the retirement system is off budget
 
04:53:52.250 --> 04:53:52.260 align:start position:0%
if it keeps growing in this deficit we
 
04:53:54.948 --> 04:53:54.958 align:start position:0%
declare bankruptcy
 
04:53:56.810 --> 04:53:56.820 align:start position:0%
divvy up how much money is in there for
 
04:53:58.310 --> 04:53:58.320 align:start position:0%
each person that's in the retirement
 
04:54:00.650 --> 04:54:00.660 align:start position:0%
system and said from now on that's your
 
04:54:00.660 --> 04:54:02.030 align:start position:0%
system and said from now on that's your
defined

04:54:02.030 --> 04:54:02.040 align:start position:0%
defined
 
04:54:04.670 --> 04:54:04.680 align:start position:0%
contribution you can add to it all you
 
04:54:06.410 --> 04:54:06.420 align:start position:0%
want and we'll add so much a year about
 
04:54:08.270 --> 04:54:08.280 align:start position:0%
the same as we've done but there's no
 
04:54:11.510 --> 04:54:11.520 align:start position:0%
way we can make up a deficit that's just
 
04:54:14.330 --> 04:54:14.340 align:start position:0%
about the same size as the whole state
 
04:54:14.340 --> 04:54:15.650 align:start position:0%
about the same size as the whole state
budget

04:54:15.650 --> 04:54:15.660 align:start position:0%
budget
 
04:54:19.368 --> 04:54:19.378 align:start position:0%
thank you oops so mayor I I I I I I
 
04:54:22.730 --> 04:54:22.740 align:start position:0%
think the bankruptcy your uh issue
 
04:54:24.770 --> 04:54:24.780 align:start position:0%
you're you're thinking of is the worst
 
04:54:28.310 --> 04:54:28.320 align:start position:0%
case scenario uh and not anyone's plan
 
04:54:32.208 --> 04:54:32.218 align:start position:0%
but on the projected course that may be
 
04:54:35.090 --> 04:54:35.100 align:start position:0%
what a future legislature faces it may
 
04:54:36.948 --> 04:54:36.958 align:start position:0%
be there maybe maybe you know the other
 
04:54:39.050 --> 04:54:39.060 align:start position:0%
choice and I know other states have done
 
04:54:39.060 --> 04:54:41.750 align:start position:0%
choice and I know other states have done
that

04:54:41.750 --> 04:54:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:44.090 --> 04:54:44.100 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire
 
04:54:45.770 --> 04:54:45.780 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
04:54:47.090 --> 04:54:47.100 align:start position:0%
representative Weiler for taking my
 
04:54:49.610 --> 04:54:49.620 align:start position:0%
question I'd like you to compare two
 
04:54:49.620 --> 04:54:50.770 align:start position:0%
question I'd like you to compare two
similar

04:54:50.770 --> 04:54:50.780 align:start position:0%
similar
 
04:54:54.650 --> 04:54:54.660 align:start position:0%
cases suppose that this committee does
 
04:54:57.530 --> 04:54:57.540 align:start position:0%
its job very well and we find that we
 
04:55:01.550 --> 04:55:01.560 align:start position:0%
have an extra 25 million dollars uh per
 
04:55:04.010 --> 04:55:04.020 align:start position:0%
year available to fund something like
 
04:55:06.770 --> 04:55:06.780 align:start position:0%
this all right and let's also suppose
 
04:55:10.208 --> 04:55:10.218 align:start position:0%
that if we were to fund house bill 50
 
04:55:14.930 --> 04:55:14.940 align:start position:0%
that the towns would return 100 of what
 
04:55:16.788 --> 04:55:16.798 align:start position:0%
they received back to their own
 
04:55:19.788 --> 04:55:19.798 align:start position:0%
taxpayers their own property tax where
 
04:55:21.530 --> 04:55:21.540 align:start position:0%
they don't spend any extra let's let's
 
04:55:24.770 --> 04:55:24.780 align:start position:0%
skip off skip that example right that's
 
04:55:26.090 --> 04:55:26.100 align:start position:0%
one alternative
 
04:55:29.208 --> 04:55:29.218 align:start position:0%
now suppose in the other alternative we
 
04:55:32.750 --> 04:55:32.760 align:start position:0%
cut the state property tax by that same
 
04:55:35.390 --> 04:55:35.400 align:start position:0%
amount that same 25 million dollars a
 
04:55:37.150 --> 04:55:37.160 align:start position:0%
year right we're collecting
 
04:55:39.708 --> 04:55:39.718 align:start position:0%
363 million dollars worth of property
 
04:55:42.708 --> 04:55:42.718 align:start position:0%
tax we could easily cut 25 a year right
 
04:55:46.190 --> 04:55:46.200 align:start position:0%
so wouldn't the difference between those
 
04:55:46.200 --> 04:55:47.628 align:start position:0%
so wouldn't the difference between those
two

04:55:47.628 --> 04:55:47.638 align:start position:0%
two
 
04:55:52.310 --> 04:55:52.320 align:start position:0%
be that towns that budget themselves
 
04:55:55.850 --> 04:55:55.860 align:start position:0%
very tightly and keep tight control over
 
04:55:58.610 --> 04:55:58.620 align:start position:0%
the number of employees they have and
 
04:56:00.650 --> 04:56:00.660 align:start position:0%
are thrifty
 
04:56:02.868 --> 04:56:02.878 align:start position:0%
would get less
 
04:56:06.770 --> 04:56:06.780 align:start position:0%
uh relatively less than towns that are
 
04:56:10.430 --> 04:56:10.440 align:start position:0%
relatively generous or expansive in
 
04:56:12.470 --> 04:56:12.480 align:start position:0%
their hiring
 
04:56:15.708 --> 04:56:15.718 align:start position:0%
and so effectively if you live in a town
 
04:56:19.368 --> 04:56:19.378 align:start position:0%
that has uh is Thrifty and has good
 
04:56:22.270 --> 04:56:22.280 align:start position:0%
budgeting wouldn't you be subsidizing
 
04:56:26.868 --> 04:56:26.878 align:start position:0%
those other towns that have expansive
 
04:56:26.878 --> 04:56:28.788 align:start position:0%
those other towns that have expansive
hiring

04:56:28.788 --> 04:56:28.798 align:start position:0%
hiring
 
04:56:32.208 --> 04:56:32.218 align:start position:0%
the answer is yes and one of the things
 
04:56:34.550 --> 04:56:34.560 align:start position:0%
we discovered years ago
 
04:56:37.070 --> 04:56:37.080 align:start position:0%
when we first put this Statewide
 
04:56:39.948 --> 04:56:39.958 align:start position:0%
education property tax was we had donor
 
04:56:42.230 --> 04:56:42.240 align:start position:0%
towns we fought that for 10 years
 
04:56:44.150 --> 04:56:44.160 align:start position:0%
because they were very upset at all this
 
04:56:46.010 --> 04:56:46.020 align:start position:0%
money game that they were paying in
 
04:56:48.110 --> 04:56:48.120 align:start position:0%
taxes going to other towns
 
04:56:50.868 --> 04:56:50.878 align:start position:0%
that didn't have the same tax basis
 
04:56:53.990 --> 04:56:54.000 align:start position:0%
so we stopped doing that and we let them
 
04:56:55.910 --> 04:56:55.920 align:start position:0%
keep everything and in some cases now
 
04:56:58.190 --> 04:56:58.200 align:start position:0%
with the decline in enrollment that
 
04:57:00.708 --> 04:57:00.718 align:start position:0%
Statewide education property tax in some
 
04:57:00.718 --> 04:57:01.670 align:start position:0%
Statewide education property tax in some
towns

04:57:01.670 --> 04:57:01.680 align:start position:0%
towns
 
04:57:03.890 --> 04:57:03.900 align:start position:0%
is bringing in more money than they need
 
04:57:06.410 --> 04:57:06.420 align:start position:0%
to educate their students so if we cut
 
04:57:08.030 --> 04:57:08.040 align:start position:0%
directly the Statewide education
 
04:57:10.490 --> 04:57:10.500 align:start position:0%
property tax it makes more sense in
 
04:57:12.050 --> 04:57:12.060 align:start position:0%
those towns ahead more than they needed
 
04:57:13.730 --> 04:57:13.740 align:start position:0%
to spend which would be another good
 
04:57:16.550 --> 04:57:16.560 align:start position:0%
thing I agree
 
04:57:18.050 --> 04:57:18.060 align:start position:0%
further questions the representative
 
04:57:18.060 --> 04:57:20.208 align:start position:0%
further questions the representative
Hull

04:57:20.208 --> 04:57:20.218 align:start position:0%
Hull
 
04:57:21.590 --> 04:57:21.600 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
04:57:23.628 --> 04:57:23.638 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
04:57:23.638 --> 04:57:24.350 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
um

04:57:24.350 --> 04:57:24.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:57:27.170 --> 04:57:27.180 align:start position:0%
to your earlier point about this is this
 
04:57:28.730 --> 04:57:28.740 align:start position:0%
act is being titled the property tax
 
04:57:31.310 --> 04:57:31.320 align:start position:0%
relief of 2023. it's my understanding
 
04:57:32.868 --> 04:57:32.878 align:start position:0%
that this is not a single year change
 
04:57:36.530 --> 04:57:36.540 align:start position:0%
but A multi-year change is that correct
 
04:57:39.948 --> 04:57:39.958 align:start position:0%
it appears to be yes follow up follow
 
04:57:42.350 --> 04:57:42.360 align:start position:0%
follow up thank you
 
04:57:43.788 --> 04:57:43.798 align:start position:0%
um if I understand our constitution
 
04:57:46.310 --> 04:57:46.320 align:start position:0%
correctly right article part one article
 
04:57:46.320 --> 04:57:48.050 align:start position:0%
correctly right article part one article
36

04:57:48.050 --> 04:57:48.060 align:start position:0%
36
 
04:57:49.730 --> 04:57:49.740 align:start position:0%
um no pension shall be granted but in
 
04:57:51.470 --> 04:57:51.480 align:start position:0%
consideration of actual services and
 
04:57:53.390 --> 04:57:53.400 align:start position:0%
such patients ought to be granted with
 
04:57:55.550 --> 04:57:55.560 align:start position:0%
great caution by the legislature and
 
04:57:56.930 --> 04:57:56.940 align:start position:0%
never for more than one year at a time
 
04:57:58.850 --> 04:57:58.860 align:start position:0%
would be we would we be in compliance
 
04:58:00.708 --> 04:58:00.718 align:start position:0%
with our constitution if we did a
 
04:58:00.718 --> 04:58:03.170 align:start position:0%
with our constitution if we did a
multi-year

04:58:03.170 --> 04:58:03.180 align:start position:0%
multi-year
 
04:58:06.470 --> 04:58:06.480 align:start position:0%
it would require us annually or at least
 
04:58:09.770 --> 04:58:09.780 align:start position:0%
biannually to keep renewing that yes
 
04:58:11.990 --> 04:58:12.000 align:start position:0%
that's why I say there was no problem
 
04:58:14.628 --> 04:58:14.638 align:start position:0%
when we took it away in the 1213 budget
 
04:58:17.868 --> 04:58:17.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:21.530 --> 04:58:21.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:25.070 --> 04:58:25.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:27.830 --> 04:58:27.840 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman Mr chairman
 
04:58:30.770 --> 04:58:30.780 align:start position:0%
I don't want to get into into all all
 
04:58:32.390 --> 04:58:32.400 align:start position:0%
the arguments that are going back and
 
04:58:32.400 --> 04:58:34.430 align:start position:0%
the arguments that are going back and
forth

04:58:34.430 --> 04:58:34.440 align:start position:0%
forth
 
04:58:35.750 --> 04:58:35.760 align:start position:0%
excuse me because that's going to be
 
04:58:37.430 --> 04:58:37.440 align:start position:0%
going on for quite a while and we all
 
04:58:38.690 --> 04:58:38.700 align:start position:0%
know that
 
04:58:41.650 --> 04:58:41.660 align:start position:0%
but I just want to focus on one question
 
04:58:45.530 --> 04:58:45.540 align:start position:0%
that has been completely ignored since
 
04:58:47.208 --> 04:58:47.218 align:start position:0%
the since the beginning
 
04:58:49.490 --> 04:58:49.500 align:start position:0%
and that is that
 
04:58:52.570 --> 04:58:52.580 align:start position:0%
it was in 1967 or so
 
04:58:55.610 --> 04:58:55.620 align:start position:0%
that the state
 
04:58:57.948 --> 04:58:57.958 align:start position:0%
made the decision that it probably
 
04:59:00.170 --> 04:59:00.180 align:start position:0%
didn't want to have four individual
 
04:59:02.930 --> 04:59:02.940 align:start position:0%
Retirement Systems floating around
 
04:59:07.070 --> 04:59:07.080 align:start position:0%
and so they've had to find a way to make
 
04:59:08.868 --> 04:59:08.878 align:start position:0%
it work better
 
04:59:13.070 --> 04:59:13.080 align:start position:0%
and that eventuated in the arrival of
 
04:59:14.868 --> 04:59:14.878 align:start position:0%
the cities and towns
 
04:59:17.510 --> 04:59:17.520 align:start position:0%
uh whom all of whom were approached by
 
04:59:18.948 --> 04:59:18.958 align:start position:0%
the state
 
04:59:21.050 --> 04:59:21.060 align:start position:0%
and the state approached the cities and
 
04:59:23.448 --> 04:59:23.458 align:start position:0%
towns and said how would you like to
 
04:59:26.448 --> 04:59:26.458 align:start position:0%
join a State Retirement System
 
04:59:26.458 --> 04:59:28.610 align:start position:0%
join a State Retirement System
and

04:59:28.610 --> 04:59:28.620 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:59:31.310 --> 04:59:31.320 align:start position:0%
any any politician will say well I don't
 
04:59:32.868 --> 04:59:32.878 align:start position:0%
want to do that right off the top of my
 
04:59:36.530 --> 04:59:36.540 align:start position:0%
head we all we all like that but
 
04:59:39.350 --> 04:59:39.360 align:start position:0%
what they said was well
 
04:59:41.990 --> 04:59:42.000 align:start position:0%
what's in it for me
 
04:59:44.330 --> 04:59:44.340 align:start position:0%
and the state responded well what's in
 
04:59:46.190 --> 04:59:46.200 align:start position:0%
it for you is that we'll pay 40 percent
 
04:59:49.550 --> 04:59:49.560 align:start position:0%
of the cost of doing this
 
04:59:52.368 --> 04:59:52.378 align:start position:0%
and they said yes and the retirement
 
04:59:55.550 --> 04:59:55.560 align:start position:0%
system was was born
 
04:59:57.890 --> 04:59:57.900 align:start position:0%
and the retirement system continued
 
05:00:00.830 --> 05:00:00.840 align:start position:0%
pretty much the same I've looked at all
 
05:00:02.750 --> 05:00:02.760 align:start position:0%
the laws and I wasn't too much that
 
05:00:05.628 --> 05:00:05.638 align:start position:0%
happened other than you know nickel and
 
05:00:07.368 --> 05:00:07.378 align:start position:0%
dime stuff to adjust one thing or
 
05:00:07.378 --> 05:00:08.270 align:start position:0%
dime stuff to adjust one thing or
another

05:00:08.270 --> 05:00:08.280 align:start position:0%
another
 
05:00:12.530 --> 05:00:12.540 align:start position:0%
uh until 2010 2011 in which the state
 
05:00:14.150 --> 05:00:14.160 align:start position:0%
decided well we're not going to do this
 
05:00:14.160 --> 05:00:15.530 align:start position:0%
decided well we're not going to do this
anymore

05:00:15.530 --> 05:00:15.540 align:start position:0%
anymore
 
05:00:17.510 --> 05:00:17.520 align:start position:0%
I think that's wrong
 
05:00:19.250 --> 05:00:19.260 align:start position:0%
and I don't think that any of the
 
05:00:20.510 --> 05:00:20.520 align:start position:0%
arguments have been made have anything
 
05:00:22.970 --> 05:00:22.980 align:start position:0%
to do with that they have to do with
 
05:00:25.128 --> 05:00:25.138 align:start position:0%
spending of money by the sounds and by
 
05:00:26.208 --> 05:00:26.218 align:start position:0%
the state
 
05:00:28.070 --> 05:00:28.080 align:start position:0%
and it has nothing to do with the people
 
05:00:30.350 --> 05:00:30.360 align:start position:0%
who do the work
 
05:00:33.230 --> 05:00:33.240 align:start position:0%
do you do you agree that that the form
 
05:00:36.948 --> 05:00:36.958 align:start position:0%
the uh formation of the retirement
 
05:00:40.270 --> 05:00:40.280 align:start position:0%
system as it exists today was made in
 
05:00:43.730 --> 05:00:43.740 align:start position:0%
1967 by the state and the communities
 
05:00:47.330 --> 05:00:47.340 align:start position:0%
getting together and establishing it
 
05:00:48.948 --> 05:00:48.958 align:start position:0%
I agree and there have been many
 
05:00:50.990 --> 05:00:51.000 align:start position:0%
offerings since at the time that we're
 
05:00:52.310 --> 05:00:52.320 align:start position:0%
not that many
 
05:00:55.730 --> 05:00:55.740 align:start position:0%
different groups offering Retirement
 
05:00:58.490 --> 05:00:58.500 align:start position:0%
Systems we hear a lot about Tia Cref Tia
 
05:01:00.830 --> 05:01:00.840 align:start position:0%
Cref and I think the the university
 
05:01:03.110 --> 05:01:03.120 align:start position:0%
system is in that system and I think
 
05:01:05.750 --> 05:01:05.760 align:start position:0%
there are other groups within the state
 
05:01:07.970 --> 05:01:07.980 align:start position:0%
that are in alternative Retirement
 
05:01:11.030 --> 05:01:11.040 align:start position:0%
Systems so everybody is free to do that
 
05:01:13.490 --> 05:01:13.500 align:start position:0%
so you know you look where you get the
 
05:01:14.990 --> 05:01:15.000 align:start position:0%
best rate where you get the best results
 
05:01:16.910 --> 05:01:16.920 align:start position:0%
and you could probably change the thing
 
05:01:18.350 --> 05:01:18.360 align:start position:0%
you could probably withdraw the money
 
05:01:19.670 --> 05:01:19.680 align:start position:0%
that you put in
 
05:01:22.490 --> 05:01:22.500 align:start position:0%
and get into a new system
 
05:01:27.310 --> 05:01:27.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:31.910 --> 05:01:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:34.010 --> 05:01:34.020 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for your
 
05:01:34.020 --> 05:01:40.190 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for your
testimony

05:01:40.190 --> 05:01:40.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:44.990 --> 05:01:45.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:51.590 --> 05:01:51.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:53.208 --> 05:01:53.218 align:start position:0%
Mr chair
 
05:01:56.690 --> 05:01:56.700 align:start position:0%
yes sir I'd like to say something
 
05:02:04.190 --> 05:02:04.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:08.150 --> 05:02:08.160 align:start position:0%
I am not used to being called a liar
 
05:02:10.730 --> 05:02:10.740 align:start position:0%
and when I am I would normally take care
 
05:02:12.590 --> 05:02:12.600 align:start position:0%
of it in a different ways and mentions
 
05:02:17.448 --> 05:02:17.458 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:19.310 --> 05:02:19.320 align:start position:0%
but if anybody wants to say that
 
05:02:22.010 --> 05:02:22.020 align:start position:0%
anything on this sheet is a lie then I
 
05:02:23.868 --> 05:02:23.878 align:start position:0%
like to talk to him there's no lies here
 
05:02:25.250 --> 05:02:25.260 align:start position:0%
there's a couple opinions there's almost
 
05:02:27.288 --> 05:02:27.298 align:start position:0%
all facts
 
05:02:29.150 --> 05:02:29.160 align:start position:0%
and I like to actually make a lot of
 
05:02:31.490 --> 05:02:31.500 align:start position:0%
other comments right now on some
 
05:02:33.470 --> 05:02:33.480 align:start position:0%
previous testimony but uh but I won't
 
05:02:35.448 --> 05:02:35.458 align:start position:0%
because I know that's not the uh the way
 
05:02:37.430 --> 05:02:37.440 align:start position:0%
it's normally done here
 
05:02:45.890 --> 05:02:45.900 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:48.230 --> 05:02:48.240 align:start position:0%
yes sir
 
05:02:51.590 --> 05:02:51.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:53.990 --> 05:02:54.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair representative Mike
 
05:02:55.310 --> 05:02:55.320 align:start position:0%
O'Brien again
 
05:02:57.350 --> 05:02:57.360 align:start position:0%
uh as you know
 
05:03:00.110 --> 05:03:00.120 align:start position:0%
and watching the pension system I can
 
05:03:02.390 --> 05:03:02.400 align:start position:0%
see if I can grab it
 
05:03:06.530 --> 05:03:06.540 align:start position:0%
but in the uh Wall Street Journal
 
05:03:08.570 --> 05:03:08.580 align:start position:0%
the question was asked by this committee
 
05:03:11.930 --> 05:03:11.940 align:start position:0%
what about a 401k
 
05:03:15.050 --> 05:03:15.060 align:start position:0%
you got to remember we went through the
 
05:03:17.470 --> 05:03:17.480 align:start position:0%
dot com era
 
05:03:19.788 --> 05:03:19.798 align:start position:0%
where you worked
 
05:03:22.670 --> 05:03:22.680 align:start position:0%
in a particular corporation IBM let's
 
05:03:24.890 --> 05:03:24.900 align:start position:0%
say for the example and then your
 
05:03:26.510 --> 05:03:26.520 align:start position:0%
friends came up and said how long you've
 
05:03:28.850 --> 05:03:28.860 align:start position:0%
been working for IBM five years aren't
 
05:03:32.090 --> 05:03:32.100 align:start position:0%
you a go-getter why don't you try Wang
 
05:03:34.430 --> 05:03:34.440 align:start position:0%
and you went to Wang and maybe get a
 
05:03:36.948 --> 05:03:36.958 align:start position:0%
vice president's job but you needed
 
05:03:39.590 --> 05:03:39.600 align:start position:0%
something in your briefcase to take with
 
05:03:42.350 --> 05:03:42.360 align:start position:0%
you from job to job to job for your
 
05:03:42.360 --> 05:03:44.030 align:start position:0%
you from job to job to job for your
pension

05:03:44.030 --> 05:03:44.040 align:start position:0%
pension
 
05:03:47.510 --> 05:03:47.520 align:start position:0%
and that's where the 401K came from
 
05:03:50.208 --> 05:03:50.218 align:start position:0%
now the difference with the defined
 
05:03:52.310 --> 05:03:52.320 align:start position:0%
benefit program keep in mind
 
05:03:55.990 --> 05:03:56.000 align:start position:0%
we want each municipality spends
 
05:03:59.390 --> 05:03:59.400 align:start position:0%
thousands of dollars
 
05:04:01.730 --> 05:04:01.740 align:start position:0%
training firefighters and police
 
05:04:04.430 --> 05:04:04.440 align:start position:0%
officers we want them to stay
 
05:04:06.230 --> 05:04:06.240 align:start position:0%
but right now there's a recruitment
 
05:04:08.990 --> 05:04:09.000 align:start position:0%
issue it's a problem we have other
 
05:04:12.948 --> 05:04:12.958 align:start position:0%
municipalities and Nashua does it too we
 
05:04:15.110 --> 05:04:15.120 align:start position:0%
raid out the Departments to get them to
 
05:04:17.448 --> 05:04:17.458 align:start position:0%
come in and it's almost like who's
 
05:04:19.430 --> 05:04:19.440 align:start position:0%
offering good benefits or anything else
 
05:04:21.650 --> 05:04:21.660 align:start position:0%
like that there is a definite retention
 
05:04:24.948 --> 05:04:24.958 align:start position:0%
problem we're hearing it right now in
 
05:04:24.958 --> 05:04:26.448 align:start position:0%
problem we're hearing it right now in
Edna

05:04:26.448 --> 05:04:26.458 align:start position:0%
Edna
 
05:04:29.510 --> 05:04:29.520 align:start position:0%
from many departments so part of the
 
05:04:30.890 --> 05:04:30.900 align:start position:0%
problems that are coming up and getting
 
05:04:33.770 --> 05:04:33.780 align:start position:0%
people to work in this type of field is
 
05:04:36.230 --> 05:04:36.240 align:start position:0%
problems with the retirement system
 
05:04:38.690 --> 05:04:38.700 align:start position:0%
so supporting this bill would have to
 
05:04:40.430 --> 05:04:40.440 align:start position:0%
fix but to get back to the Wall Street
 
05:04:43.788 --> 05:04:43.798 align:start position:0%
Journal article the inventor of the 401K
 
05:04:46.310 --> 05:04:46.320 align:start position:0%
did write it and if the committee wishes
 
05:04:48.530 --> 05:04:48.540 align:start position:0%
I'll see if I can find it
 
05:04:51.050 --> 05:04:51.060 align:start position:0%
and to have it reprinted and give it to
 
05:04:53.448 --> 05:04:53.458 align:start position:0%
the committee but he has deep regret in
 
05:04:56.090 --> 05:04:56.100 align:start position:0%
inventing the 401K let's keep in mind
 
05:04:57.650 --> 05:04:57.660 align:start position:0%
the government gives you the high end
 
05:05:00.530 --> 05:05:00.540 align:start position:0%
but doesn't do anything if you make less
 
05:05:02.750 --> 05:05:02.760 align:start position:0%
payments so what's going to happen to
 
05:05:04.788 --> 05:05:04.798 align:start position:0%
the generation that decided to buy the
 
05:05:07.490 --> 05:05:07.500 align:start position:0%
vote the vote or the car or something
 
05:05:09.230 --> 05:05:09.240 align:start position:0%
like that instead of putting the maximum
 
05:05:11.810 --> 05:05:11.820 align:start position:0%
amount into the pension system that's
 
05:05:14.390 --> 05:05:14.400 align:start position:0%
the beauty of a defined benefit
 
05:05:18.050 --> 05:05:18.060 align:start position:0%
the employees cannot touch that fund
 
05:05:20.868 --> 05:05:20.878 align:start position:0%
that is there forever and it's supposed
 
05:05:23.208 --> 05:05:23.218 align:start position:0%
to go in there and again don't touch it
 
05:05:25.730 --> 05:05:25.740 align:start position:0%
let it grow let one dollar bill meet
 
05:05:27.590 --> 05:05:27.600 align:start position:0%
another dollar bill and make five dollar
 
05:05:30.590 --> 05:05:30.600 align:start position:0%
bills that's the intention of any
 
05:05:34.310 --> 05:05:34.320 align:start position:0%
pension program that didn't happen here
 
05:05:36.288 --> 05:05:36.298 align:start position:0%
or else we wouldn't be here discussing
 
05:05:36.298 --> 05:05:37.550 align:start position:0%
or else we wouldn't be here discussing
this

05:05:37.550 --> 05:05:37.560 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:05:41.750 --> 05:05:41.760 align:start position:0%
okay so the thing is the 401K is not
 
05:05:45.410 --> 05:05:45.420 align:start position:0%
really the right answer to look at this
 
05:05:47.390 --> 05:05:47.400 align:start position:0%
and particularly for the recruitment
 
05:05:48.910 --> 05:05:48.920 align:start position:0%
issue but if you want that information
 
05:05:51.590 --> 05:05:51.600 align:start position:0%
I'll try to find it
 
05:05:55.190 --> 05:05:55.200 align:start position:0%
and Supply to this committee but he the
 
05:05:58.850 --> 05:05:58.860 align:start position:0%
author of the 401K has regret
 
05:06:00.830 --> 05:06:00.840 align:start position:0%
it could have been something better
 
05:06:03.590 --> 05:06:03.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:05.150 --> 05:06:05.160 align:start position:0%
we take a question
 
05:06:07.788 --> 05:06:07.798 align:start position:0%
oh absolutely I never miss an
 
05:06:10.430 --> 05:06:10.440 align:start position:0%
opportunity I guess I didn't need to ask
 
05:06:13.970 --> 05:06:13.980 align:start position:0%
that I representative policeman
 
05:06:16.750 --> 05:06:16.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you Mr
 
05:06:19.128 --> 05:06:19.138 align:start position:0%
representative O'Brien I know you're not
 
05:06:23.570 --> 05:06:23.580 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:26.810 --> 05:06:26.820 align:start position:0%
so as you know and most of us around the
 
05:06:28.490 --> 05:06:28.500 align:start position:0%
room know that there's between like a
 
05:06:31.250 --> 05:06:31.260 align:start position:0%
300 and 400 million dollar Surplus and a
 
05:06:32.868 --> 05:06:32.878 align:start position:0%
lot of folks are asking for a piece of
 
05:06:32.878 --> 05:06:33.590 align:start position:0%
lot of folks are asking for a piece of
that

05:06:33.590 --> 05:06:33.600 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:06:35.150 --> 05:06:35.160 align:start position:0%
and of course the committee is going to
 
05:06:36.230 --> 05:06:36.240 align:start position:0%
have to decide whether we're going to
 
05:06:38.990 --> 05:06:39.000 align:start position:0%
make one-time contributions towards some
 
05:06:41.590 --> 05:06:41.600 align:start position:0%
of these requests or they're going to be
 
05:06:44.930 --> 05:06:44.940 align:start position:0%
ignored until the next session so
 
05:06:46.670 --> 05:06:46.680 align:start position:0%
there's another bill maybe you're going
 
05:06:48.830 --> 05:06:48.840 align:start position:0%
to stick around to speak on it but
 
05:06:50.690 --> 05:06:50.700 align:start position:0%
suggestions have been made that we
 
05:06:52.550 --> 05:06:52.560 align:start position:0%
either make a one-time contribution
 
05:06:56.708 --> 05:06:56.718 align:start position:0%
towards the retirement system of the 7.5
 
05:06:59.930 --> 05:06:59.940 align:start position:0%
or maybe we take some of that Surplus
 
05:07:02.690 --> 05:07:02.700 align:start position:0%
and go towards the unfunded liability do
 
05:07:02.700 --> 05:07:03.410 align:start position:0%
and go towards the unfunded liability do
you

05:07:03.410 --> 05:07:03.420 align:start position:0%
you
 
05:07:06.110 --> 05:07:06.120 align:start position:0%
like that particular proposal if you had
 
05:07:07.550 --> 05:07:07.560 align:start position:0%
to choose one or the other and I know
 
05:07:07.560 --> 05:07:08.510 align:start position:0%
to choose one or the other and I know
you'll

05:07:08.510 --> 05:07:08.520 align:start position:0%
you'll
 
05:07:11.330 --> 05:07:11.340 align:start position:0%
be honest with me with that yeah thank
 
05:07:13.190 --> 05:07:13.200 align:start position:0%
you representative leishman because I
 
05:07:15.708 --> 05:07:15.718 align:start position:0%
have had this conversation with his
 
05:07:18.350 --> 05:07:18.360 align:start position:0%
honor the mayor James donches of Nashua
 
05:07:21.110 --> 05:07:21.120 align:start position:0%
and he would like to see the Standalone
 
05:07:24.230 --> 05:07:24.240 align:start position:0%
of this whether going to the unfunded
 
05:07:28.368 --> 05:07:28.378 align:start position:0%
liability uh yes in 2039 the unfunded
 
05:07:31.010 --> 05:07:31.020 align:start position:0%
liability okay and this this is how
 
05:07:32.628 --> 05:07:32.638 align:start position:0%
things happen
 
05:07:35.690 --> 05:07:35.700 align:start position:0%
there's no guarantee at the end of 2039
 
05:07:38.510 --> 05:07:38.520 align:start position:0%
that the unfunded liability will be met
 
05:07:40.310 --> 05:07:40.320 align:start position:0%
if they're telling you it is they're
 
05:07:43.128 --> 05:07:43.138 align:start position:0%
lying to you you'll be substantially
 
05:07:46.310 --> 05:07:46.320 align:start position:0%
paid off but then again coming up with
 
05:07:48.050 --> 05:07:48.060 align:start position:0%
the unfunded liability what's the
 
05:07:50.270 --> 05:07:50.280 align:start position:0%
benefit what's the cost benefit analysis
 
05:07:52.670 --> 05:07:52.680 align:start position:0%
remember I told you that in the uh
 
05:07:56.150 --> 05:07:56.160 align:start position:0%
Municipal Public Works pension system
 
05:07:59.208 --> 05:07:59.218 align:start position:0%
that the city's in charge of hok and how
 
05:08:02.810 --> 05:08:02.820 align:start position:0%
come says that to be 87 funded in
 
05:08:04.910 --> 05:08:04.920 align:start position:0%
another group says we're almost like 92
 
05:08:07.190 --> 05:08:07.200 align:start position:0%
percent funded that's darn good compared
 
05:08:08.948 --> 05:08:08.958 align:start position:0%
to other pension systems that are around
 
05:08:11.770 --> 05:08:11.780 align:start position:0%
right now I I think we're probably
 
05:08:14.030 --> 05:08:14.040 align:start position:0%
you've got to have to ask New Hampshire
 
05:08:16.490 --> 05:08:16.500 align:start position:0%
retirement system but some of the
 
05:08:18.170 --> 05:08:18.180 align:start position:0%
changes that were done were to the
 
05:08:21.288 --> 05:08:21.298 align:start position:0%
better but did some things we we are a
 
05:08:22.788 --> 05:08:22.798 align:start position:0%
little bit better off I think the
 
05:08:25.070 --> 05:08:25.080 align:start position:0%
municipalities would like to see the
 
05:08:26.930 --> 05:08:26.940 align:start position:0%
money come back to them that they can
 
05:08:29.628 --> 05:08:29.638 align:start position:0%
decide basically on what to do with the
 
05:08:32.510 --> 05:08:32.520 align:start position:0%
dollars because it comes down to all
 
05:08:35.390 --> 05:08:35.400 align:start position:0%
other things encompassing uh you got to
 
05:08:37.788 --> 05:08:37.798 align:start position:0%
remember municipalities when you're in
 
05:08:39.250 --> 05:08:39.260 align:start position:0%
charge of a city
 
05:08:42.050 --> 05:08:42.060 align:start position:0%
you are not supposed to make a buckle
 
05:08:44.208 --> 05:08:44.218 align:start position:0%
what is our product we don't sell
 
05:08:44.218 --> 05:08:45.948 align:start position:0%
what is our product we don't sell
widgets

05:08:45.948 --> 05:08:45.958 align:start position:0%
widgets
 
05:08:49.550 --> 05:08:49.560 align:start position:0%
we're supposed to provide a quality of
 
05:08:49.560 --> 05:08:51.170 align:start position:0%
we're supposed to provide a quality of
life

05:08:51.170 --> 05:08:51.180 align:start position:0%
life
 
05:08:53.628 --> 05:08:53.638 align:start position:0%
for our constituents
 
05:08:56.270 --> 05:08:56.280 align:start position:0%
that means plow the roads salt them when
 
05:08:58.910 --> 05:08:58.920 align:start position:0%
it snows everything else educate the
 
05:08:58.920 --> 05:09:00.110 align:start position:0%
it snows everything else educate the
children

05:09:00.110 --> 05:09:00.120 align:start position:0%
children
 
05:09:02.448 --> 05:09:02.458 align:start position:0%
if there's a fire have a fire department
 
05:09:05.208 --> 05:09:05.218 align:start position:0%
if there's a crime rate have a
 
05:09:07.490 --> 05:09:07.500 align:start position:0%
substantial Police Department our job is
 
05:09:07.500 --> 05:09:08.628 align:start position:0%
substantial Police Department our job is
people

05:09:08.628 --> 05:09:08.638 align:start position:0%
people
 
05:09:11.390 --> 05:09:11.400 align:start position:0%
when you take the mantle and municipal
 
05:09:11.400 --> 05:09:12.470 align:start position:0%
when you take the mantle and municipal
government

05:09:12.470 --> 05:09:12.480 align:start position:0%
government
 
05:09:15.410 --> 05:09:15.420 align:start position:0%
and when you can't get policemen to come
 
05:09:17.570 --> 05:09:17.580 align:start position:0%
in and work particularly the largest
 
05:09:19.788 --> 05:09:19.798 align:start position:0%
cities Manchester and Nashua who wants
 
05:09:22.070 --> 05:09:22.080 align:start position:0%
to get puked on spin on and kicked
 
05:09:23.448 --> 05:09:23.458 align:start position:0%
around the universe
 
05:09:25.190 --> 05:09:25.200 align:start position:0%
none of us do
 
05:09:26.930 --> 05:09:26.940 align:start position:0%
but you got to keep in mind that old
 
05:09:29.330 --> 05:09:29.340 align:start position:0%
adage that used to say well the job
 
05:09:32.570 --> 05:09:32.580 align:start position:0%
stinks but the pennies were good
 
05:09:34.730 --> 05:09:34.740 align:start position:0%
now the job still stinks in the Benny
 
05:09:34.740 --> 05:09:36.708 align:start position:0%
now the job still stinks in the Benny
stink

05:09:36.708 --> 05:09:36.718 align:start position:0%
stink
 
05:09:39.530 --> 05:09:39.540 align:start position:0%
so this is the recruitment problem
 
05:09:41.090 --> 05:09:41.100 align:start position:0%
so you got to look at the whole thing
 
05:09:44.150 --> 05:09:44.160 align:start position:0%
but I know I over answered my family did
 
05:09:48.350 --> 05:09:48.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:51.470 --> 05:09:51.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:53.208 --> 05:09:53.218 align:start position:0%

um on February 15th I'll be bringing a
 
05:10:02.090 --> 05:10:02.100 align:start position:0%
defined contribution Pension Plan Bill
 
05:10:04.730 --> 05:10:04.740 align:start position:0%
to your committee and I hope to convince
 
05:10:08.090 --> 05:10:08.100 align:start position:0%
you to support it specifically because
 
05:10:12.590 --> 05:10:12.600 align:start position:0%
it removes the 400 representatives from
 
05:10:15.530 --> 05:10:15.540 align:start position:0%
from the control of the system when
 
05:10:17.810 --> 05:10:17.820 align:start position:0%
people get their money they get it right
 
05:10:19.970 --> 05:10:19.980 align:start position:0%
away and it's theirs and there are no

I want to talk about
um

05:13:01.430 --> 05:13:01.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:13:06.890 --> 05:13:06.900 align:start position:0%

and is representative
 
05:13:25.190 --> 05:13:25.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:28.368 --> 05:13:28.378 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Mr chair
 
05:13:30.230 --> 05:13:30.240 align:start position:0%
for the record representative Jeff goli
 
05:13:32.030 --> 05:13:32.040 align:start position:0%
representing Hillsboro district 21
 
05:13:34.250 --> 05:13:34.260 align:start position:0%
Manchester Ward 1.
 
05:13:36.770 --> 05:13:36.780 align:start position:0%
and I'm here to uh
 
05:13:39.830 --> 05:13:39.840 align:start position:0%
try and be the follow-up of that act you
 
05:13:40.970 --> 05:13:40.980 align:start position:0%
just had before you it's going to be
 
05:13:46.850 --> 05:13:46.860 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:48.650 --> 05:13:48.660 align:start position:0%
so I'm here today to introduce House
 
05:13:53.150 --> 05:13:53.160 align:start position:0%
Bill 555 FNA and
 
05:13:56.390 --> 05:13:56.400 align:start position:0%
um what this build does as you've all
 
05:13:58.368 --> 05:13:58.378 align:start position:0%
heard a lot about the retirement system
 
05:14:02.030 --> 05:14:02.040 align:start position:0%
and what's going on over there currently
 
05:14:04.850 --> 05:14:04.860 align:start position:0%
um with the unfunded liability
 
05:14:10.250 --> 05:14:10.260 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:12.288 --> 05:14:12.298 align:start position:0%
take 75 percent of any of the amount
 
05:14:14.570 --> 05:14:14.580 align:start position:0%
left over after the rainy day fund is
 
05:14:16.850 --> 05:14:16.860 align:start position:0%
filled and apply it to the pension fund
 
05:14:20.110 --> 05:14:20.120 align:start position:0%
unfunded Actuarial accrued liability
 
05:14:20.120 --> 05:14:21.948 align:start position:0%
unfunded Actuarial accrued liability
and

05:14:21.948 --> 05:14:21.958 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:14:24.470 --> 05:14:24.480 align:start position:0%
in doing so we look at it as paying off
 
05:14:27.110 --> 05:14:27.120 align:start position:0%
our debts and the sooner we pay off our
 
05:14:27.120 --> 05:14:28.250 align:start position:0%
our debts and the sooner we pay off our
debts

05:14:28.250 --> 05:14:28.260 align:start position:0%
debts
 
05:14:31.010 --> 05:14:31.020 align:start position:0%
the better off the taxpayer is going
 
05:14:33.288 --> 05:14:33.298 align:start position:0%
forward I mean this is a way of directly
 
05:14:33.298 --> 05:14:34.670 align:start position:0%
forward I mean this is a way of directly
reducing

05:14:34.670 --> 05:14:34.680 align:start position:0%
reducing
 
05:14:38.150 --> 05:14:38.160 align:start position:0%
the tax rates for cities and towns
 
05:14:40.850 --> 05:14:40.860 align:start position:0%
over 80 percent of their pension costs
 
05:14:43.550 --> 05:14:43.560 align:start position:0%
are going directly towards the unfunded
 
05:14:46.190 --> 05:14:46.200 align:start position:0%
accrued liability so the quicker we can
 
05:14:48.410 --> 05:14:48.420 align:start position:0%
get this paid off
 
05:14:50.448 --> 05:14:50.458 align:start position:0%
the sooner the sooner we pay it off the
 
05:14:53.208 --> 05:14:53.218 align:start position:0%
sooner they get rate reductions and
 
05:14:55.730 --> 05:14:55.740 align:start position:0%
we're looking at that as an important
 
05:14:57.770 --> 05:14:57.780 align:start position:0%
tax relief bill
 
05:14:57.780 --> 05:14:58.788 align:start position:0%
tax relief bill
um

05:14:58.788 --> 05:14:58.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:15:00.830 --> 05:15:00.840 align:start position:0%
when when you go when you go forward and
 
05:15:02.510 --> 05:15:02.520 align:start position:0%
you heard
 
05:15:04.368 --> 05:15:04.378 align:start position:0%
I think previously I wasn't here for the
 
05:15:06.530 --> 05:15:06.540 align:start position:0%
beginning of the testimony as to how we
 
05:15:08.390 --> 05:15:08.400 align:start position:0%
acquired the unfunded accrued liability
 
05:15:10.610 --> 05:15:10.620 align:start position:0%
it was over a number of years of not
 
05:15:12.590 --> 05:15:12.600 align:start position:0%
properly funding the system
 
05:15:12.600 --> 05:15:14.510 align:start position:0%
properly funding the system
and

05:15:14.510 --> 05:15:14.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:15:16.730 --> 05:15:16.740 align:start position:0%
folks may say well why are we paying
 
05:15:20.570 --> 05:15:20.580 align:start position:0%
help paying off that unfunded liability
 
05:15:23.570 --> 05:15:23.580 align:start position:0%
well as many of you know or have heard
 
05:15:26.390 --> 05:15:26.400 align:start position:0%
that it was because of some of the
 
05:15:29.510 --> 05:15:29.520 align:start position:0%
legislation passed here by us that
 
05:15:32.208 --> 05:15:32.218 align:start position:0%
caused that unfunded accrued liability
 
05:15:34.670 --> 05:15:34.680 align:start position:0%
because we did not address it at the
 
05:15:36.410 --> 05:15:36.420 align:start position:0%
proper time and let it Fester over for
 
05:15:39.110 --> 05:15:39.120 align:start position:0%
over 10 years without changing the rates
 
05:15:40.788 --> 05:15:40.798 align:start position:0%
back to where they should be
 
05:15:43.368 --> 05:15:43.378 align:start position:0%
so I think it's important that we step
 
05:15:46.730 --> 05:15:46.740 align:start position:0%
up to the plate and help if we have a
 
05:15:48.770 --> 05:15:48.780 align:start position:0%
surplus and that's only if we have a
 
05:15:51.830 --> 05:15:51.840 align:start position:0%
surplus not coming out of a regular
 
05:15:55.670 --> 05:15:55.680 align:start position:0%
budget that we use Surplus money to pay
 
05:15:58.510 --> 05:15:58.520 align:start position:0%
off the debt
 
05:16:01.850 --> 05:16:01.860 align:start position:0%
and also as
 
05:16:05.990 --> 05:16:06.000 align:start position:0%
the that is and this is only this amount
 
05:16:07.368 --> 05:16:07.378 align:start position:0%
is only going through as long as we have
 
05:16:10.368 --> 05:16:10.378 align:start position:0%
that debt which is you've heard is
 
05:16:13.850 --> 05:16:13.860 align:start position:0%
on Pace to be paid off in 2039 I think
 
05:16:15.170 --> 05:16:15.180 align:start position:0%
by doing what we're doing here we could
 
05:16:17.208 --> 05:16:17.218 align:start position:0%
pay it off quicker so once that's paid
 
05:16:18.530 --> 05:16:18.540 align:start position:0%
off this
 
05:16:21.730 --> 05:16:21.740 align:start position:0%
peace will no longer be necessary so
 
05:16:24.530 --> 05:16:24.540 align:start position:0%
with that I'd be happy to take any
 
05:16:26.208 --> 05:16:26.218 align:start position:0%
questions I know there's a few other
 
05:16:27.830 --> 05:16:27.840 align:start position:0%
folks behind me here to talk more about
 
05:16:27.840 --> 05:16:29.570 align:start position:0%
folks behind me here to talk more about
this

05:16:29.570 --> 05:16:29.580 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:16:31.490 --> 05:16:31.500 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
05:16:34.850 --> 05:16:34.860 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:37.010 --> 05:16:37.020 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
05:16:40.670 --> 05:16:40.680 align:start position:0%
my question I generally like the idea of
 
05:16:43.250 --> 05:16:43.260 align:start position:0%
paying your debts so I'm generally in
 
05:16:45.948 --> 05:16:45.958 align:start position:0%
favor of this but I'm I am curious about
 
05:16:45.958 --> 05:16:48.708 align:start position:0%
favor of this but I'm I am curious about
implementation

05:16:48.708 --> 05:16:48.718 align:start position:0%
implementation
 
05:16:52.310 --> 05:16:52.320 align:start position:0%
this past term we had a special project
 
05:16:55.670 --> 05:16:55.680 align:start position:0%
we we saw the need to create a
 
05:16:57.830 --> 05:16:57.840 align:start position:0%
settlement fund worth 100 million
 
05:17:01.010 --> 05:17:01.020 align:start position:0%
dollars to pay for previous liabilities
 
05:17:07.010 --> 05:17:07.020 align:start position:0%
to make whole abuse people in our penal
 
05:17:07.020 --> 05:17:08.030 align:start position:0%
to make whole abuse people in our penal
system

05:17:08.030 --> 05:17:08.040 align:start position:0%
system
 
05:17:10.310 --> 05:17:10.320 align:start position:0%
would would this
 
05:17:14.090 --> 05:17:14.100 align:start position:0%
prevent having that option on the
 
05:17:14.100 --> 05:17:15.890 align:start position:0%
prevent having that option on the
Surplus

05:17:15.890 --> 05:17:15.900 align:start position:0%
Surplus
 
05:17:20.690 --> 05:17:20.700 align:start position:0%
um would would this 75 percent over and
 
05:17:24.110 --> 05:17:24.120 align:start position:0%
above the the rainy day fund
 
05:17:27.070 --> 05:17:27.080 align:start position:0%
would this tire hands if we got another
 
05:17:29.930 --> 05:17:29.940 align:start position:0%
special project that we needed to fund
 
05:17:33.050 --> 05:17:33.060 align:start position:0%
which would have precedence
 
05:17:35.330 --> 05:17:35.340 align:start position:0%
that's a good question
 
05:17:35.340 --> 05:17:36.350 align:start position:0%
that's a good question
um

05:17:36.350 --> 05:17:36.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:17:37.788 --> 05:17:37.798 align:start position:0%
to be honest with you I cannot answer
 
05:17:40.850 --> 05:17:40.860 align:start position:0%
that right now off the top of my head um
 
05:17:42.530 --> 05:17:42.540 align:start position:0%
and someone behind me can answer that
 
05:17:44.628 --> 05:17:44.638 align:start position:0%
I'm hearing all right thank you and I
 
05:17:50.090 --> 05:17:50.100 align:start position:0%
ever and and also the 75 is obviously a
 
05:17:52.128 --> 05:17:52.138 align:start position:0%
starting point and if this committee so
 
05:17:54.470 --> 05:17:54.480 align:start position:0%
chooses to reduce that amount at any
 
05:17:56.750 --> 05:17:56.760 align:start position:0%
amount uh but we just think it's
 
05:17:58.550 --> 05:17:58.560 align:start position:0%
important that we put that at the
 
05:18:00.410 --> 05:18:00.420 align:start position:0%
Forefront of paying off our debts yes
 
05:18:00.420 --> 05:18:01.490 align:start position:0%
Forefront of paying off our debts yes
sir

05:18:01.490 --> 05:18:01.500 align:start position:0%
sir
 
05:18:03.230 --> 05:18:03.240 align:start position:0%
um man
 
05:18:06.230 --> 05:18:06.240 align:start position:0%
and and then this this feels to me like
 
05:18:08.270 --> 05:18:08.280 align:start position:0%
a bill that's begging for a sunset
 
05:18:11.030 --> 05:18:11.040 align:start position:0%
provision that that this gets repealed
 
05:18:14.750 --> 05:18:14.760 align:start position:0%
at some point if we ever pay off the uh
 
05:18:17.810 --> 05:18:17.820 align:start position:0%
accrued liability and I'm not I'm not
 
05:18:20.570 --> 05:18:20.580 align:start position:0%
seeing a repeal like that
 
05:18:22.190 --> 05:18:22.200 align:start position:0%
should it have one
 
05:18:25.128 --> 05:18:25.138 align:start position:0%
I believe the way the legislation is
 
05:18:27.830 --> 05:18:27.840 align:start position:0%
written that once that liability is paid
 
05:18:30.050 --> 05:18:30.060 align:start position:0%
that no other money goes to well if you
 
05:18:31.730 --> 05:18:31.740 align:start position:0%
have no unfunded accrued liability then
 
05:18:34.190 --> 05:18:34.200 align:start position:0%
there's no place to pay it all right
 
05:18:37.368 --> 05:18:37.378 align:start position:0%
that's logical thank you thank you
 
05:18:39.530 --> 05:18:39.540 align:start position:0%
any other questions uh representative
 
05:18:41.208 --> 05:18:41.218 align:start position:0%
Mooney thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
05:18:42.948 --> 05:18:42.958 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question uh perhaps
 
05:18:44.750 --> 05:18:44.760 align:start position:0%
you representative or representative
 
05:18:48.590 --> 05:18:48.600 align:start position:0%
McGuire could give an example using
 
05:18:53.270 --> 05:18:53.280 align:start position:0%
monetary amounts would be helpful in
 
05:18:55.910 --> 05:18:55.920 align:start position:0%
terms of envisioning this because it's
 
05:18:58.250 --> 05:18:58.260 align:start position:0%
quite intriguing thank you I think
 
05:18:59.628 --> 05:18:59.638 align:start position:0%
representative inquire behind me is
 
05:19:01.250 --> 05:19:01.260 align:start position:0%
shaking his head he will perfect thank
 
05:19:01.260 --> 05:19:03.410 align:start position:0%
shaking his head he will perfect thank
you

05:19:03.410 --> 05:19:03.420 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:07.070 --> 05:19:07.080 align:start position:0%

Mr Mr Kavanaugh
 
05:19:26.510 --> 05:19:26.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:28.850 --> 05:19:28.860 align:start position:0%
my name is Mark Cavanaugh I'm associate
 
05:19:30.470 --> 05:19:30.480 align:start position:0%
Council and compliance officer with the
 
05:19:32.448 --> 05:19:32.458 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Retirement System
 
05:19:35.030 --> 05:19:35.040 align:start position:0%
uh typically when I sit in this chair we
 
05:19:38.270 --> 05:19:38.280 align:start position:0%
don't take positions policy matters but
 
05:19:39.708 --> 05:19:39.718 align:start position:0%
in this case we're going to make an
 
05:19:41.330 --> 05:19:41.340 align:start position:0%
exception and we're in support of any
 
05:19:42.830 --> 05:19:42.840 align:start position:0%
bill that's going to give us more money
 
05:19:45.368 --> 05:19:45.378 align:start position:0%
and help us with the underfunding
 
05:19:49.190 --> 05:19:49.200 align:start position:0%
we have an amortization plan where about
 
05:19:49.200 --> 05:19:50.570 align:start position:0%
we have an amortization plan where about
uh

05:19:50.570 --> 05:19:50.580 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:19:53.868 --> 05:19:53.878 align:start position:0%
18 years into it
 
05:19:53.878 --> 05:19:54.650 align:start position:0%
18 years into it
um

05:19:54.650 --> 05:19:54.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:19:57.250 --> 05:19:57.260 align:start position:0%
and it's like a mortgage and this bill
 
05:20:01.128 --> 05:20:01.138 align:start position:0%
would be analogous to paying down some
 
05:20:03.350 --> 05:20:03.360 align:start position:0%
of your principal of your mortgage ahead
 
05:20:04.310 --> 05:20:04.320 align:start position:0%
of time
 
05:20:07.910 --> 05:20:07.920 align:start position:0%
and we think that's a good idea uh it
 
05:20:09.410 --> 05:20:09.420 align:start position:0%
depending on the amounts which are
 
05:20:11.570 --> 05:20:11.580 align:start position:0%
totally unpredictable so we couldn't put
 
05:20:13.270 --> 05:20:13.280 align:start position:0%
a dollar on it
 
05:20:16.730 --> 05:20:16.740 align:start position:0%
that would have the effect of reducing
 
05:20:18.890 --> 05:20:18.900 align:start position:0%
the underfunding which would then have
 
05:20:21.770 --> 05:20:21.780 align:start position:0%
the effect of possibly reducing employer
 
05:20:25.490 --> 05:20:25.500 align:start position:0%
contributions in the future
 
05:20:29.930 --> 05:20:29.940 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:29.940 --> 05:20:33.670 align:start position:0%
 
representative

05:20:33.670 --> 05:20:33.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:36.830 --> 05:20:36.840 align:start position:0%
sorry thank you thank you Mr chair and
 
05:20:38.690 --> 05:20:38.700 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking the question would
 
05:20:41.150 --> 05:20:41.160 align:start position:0%
it be possible for nhrs to prepare you
 
05:20:42.708 --> 05:20:42.718 align:start position:0%
know like
 
05:20:44.690 --> 05:20:44.700 align:start position:0%
we could ask from a mortgage company
 
05:20:46.970 --> 05:20:46.980 align:start position:0%
since we use that example a schedule
 
05:20:49.190 --> 05:20:49.200 align:start position:0%
showing that if we put so many millions
 
05:20:51.590 --> 05:20:51.600 align:start position:0%
of dollars at the end of this year the
 
05:20:54.230 --> 05:20:54.240 align:start position:0%
estimate is that this will cut this
 
05:20:56.150 --> 05:20:56.160 align:start position:0%
total amount of payments including debt
 
05:20:58.190 --> 05:20:58.200 align:start position:0%
and it will accelerate the uh you know
 
05:21:00.948 --> 05:21:00.958 align:start position:0%
ability to pay for it we understand it
 
05:21:03.288 --> 05:21:03.298 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be guaranteed because all those
 
05:21:04.730 --> 05:21:04.740 align:start position:0%
assumptions change but I'm just looking
 
05:21:07.070 --> 05:21:07.080 align:start position:0%
for numbers consistent with your current
 
05:21:08.990 --> 05:21:09.000 align:start position:0%
assumptions basically in the same model
 
05:21:11.330 --> 05:21:11.340 align:start position:0%
what difference would it make it it
 
05:21:14.150 --> 05:21:14.160 align:start position:0%
would probably help
 
05:21:16.970 --> 05:21:16.980 align:start position:0%
decide policy decisions in terms of how
 
05:21:19.190 --> 05:21:19.200 align:start position:0%
best to spend the money when we see how
 
05:21:21.110 --> 05:21:21.120 align:start position:0%
much we may save in the future versus
 
05:21:23.990 --> 05:21:24.000 align:start position:0%
other types of legislation
 
05:21:27.170 --> 05:21:27.180 align:start position:0%
um right well our actuaries have looked
 
05:21:29.390 --> 05:21:29.400 align:start position:0%
at it and at this point there's just too
 
05:21:31.868 --> 05:21:31.878 align:start position:0%
indeterminate to to put a number on it
 
05:21:37.490 --> 05:21:37.500 align:start position:0%
and uh and also we use our actuary for
 
05:21:40.368 --> 05:21:40.378 align:start position:0%
these matters in response to particular
 
05:21:42.770 --> 05:21:42.780 align:start position:0%
bills that ask for particular things we
 
05:21:46.128 --> 05:21:46.138 align:start position:0%
don't just do hypotheticals
 
05:21:49.368 --> 05:21:49.378 align:start position:0%
um it because we're we're the plan we're
 
05:21:51.430 --> 05:21:51.440 align:start position:0%
not the plan sponsor so we shouldn't be
 
05:21:53.930 --> 05:21:53.940 align:start position:0%
assisting or paying the planned sponsor
 
05:21:55.910 --> 05:21:55.920 align:start position:0%
to make policy decisions about how a
 
05:21:57.530 --> 05:21:57.540 align:start position:0%
plan should be designed
 
05:22:00.110 --> 05:22:00.120 align:start position:0%
uh or implemented those are what they
 
05:22:01.730 --> 05:22:01.740 align:start position:0%
call plant sponsor costs and you
 
05:22:04.070 --> 05:22:04.080 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be using uh money that's set
 
05:22:07.128 --> 05:22:07.138 align:start position:0%
aside to pay benefits both under federal
 
05:22:09.770 --> 05:22:09.780 align:start position:0%
law and under our uh Constitution that
 
05:22:12.230 --> 05:22:12.240 align:start position:0%
says those assets of the plan are to be
 
05:22:13.910 --> 05:22:13.920 align:start position:0%
used for the exclusive benefit of the
 
05:22:13.920 --> 05:22:15.530 align:start position:0%
used for the exclusive benefit of the
members

05:22:15.530 --> 05:22:15.540 align:start position:0%
members
 
05:22:15.540 --> 05:22:16.128 align:start position:0%
members
um

05:22:16.128 --> 05:22:16.138 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:22:18.788 --> 05:22:18.798 align:start position:0%
but if you give me a call I can
 
05:22:21.050 --> 05:22:21.060 align:start position:0%
recommend an actuary for you who might
 
05:22:24.288 --> 05:22:24.298 align:start position:0%
do it thank you
 
05:22:26.930 --> 05:22:26.940 align:start position:0%
further questions uh representative
 
05:22:28.730 --> 05:22:28.740 align:start position:0%
tolarski thank you very much thank you
 
05:22:30.288 --> 05:22:30.298 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
05:22:33.410 --> 05:22:33.420 align:start position:0%
um could you just give me an idea and I
 
05:22:34.788 --> 05:22:34.798 align:start position:0%
hope I understand the concept correctly
 
05:22:37.550 --> 05:22:37.560 align:start position:0%
the percentage that a municipality pays
 
05:22:40.368 --> 05:22:40.378 align:start position:0%
that's directed just towards the
 
05:22:40.378 --> 05:22:41.690 align:start position:0%
that's directed just towards the
unfunded

05:22:41.690 --> 05:22:41.700 align:start position:0%
unfunded
 
05:22:44.930 --> 05:22:44.940 align:start position:0%
um amount and how much it's about 75 to
 
05:22:46.970 --> 05:22:46.980 align:start position:0%
80 percent of the employer portion of
 
05:22:48.470 --> 05:22:48.480 align:start position:0%
the contributions
 
05:22:51.590 --> 05:22:51.600 align:start position:0%
so we have employee contributions and
 
05:22:53.330 --> 05:22:53.340 align:start position:0%
employer contributions
 
05:22:56.750 --> 05:22:56.760 align:start position:0%
we have the normal cost which is the
 
05:22:58.490 --> 05:22:58.500 align:start position:0%
cost of the benefit that is accruing
 
05:22:59.690 --> 05:22:59.700 align:start position:0%
this year
 
05:23:01.788 --> 05:23:01.798 align:start position:0%
for each individual
 
05:23:03.890 --> 05:23:03.900 align:start position:0%
all of the member contributions go
 
05:23:06.590 --> 05:23:06.600 align:start position:0%
towards that normal cost
 
05:23:09.110 --> 05:23:09.120 align:start position:0%
the employer contribution and that picks
 
05:23:11.090 --> 05:23:11.100 align:start position:0%
up about three quarters of the normal
 
05:23:13.368 --> 05:23:13.378 align:start position:0%
cost the employer contribution picks up
 
05:23:15.530 --> 05:23:15.540 align:start position:0%
the remainder of that normal cost and
 
05:23:17.208 --> 05:23:17.218 align:start position:0%
all of the underfunding
 
05:23:20.208 --> 05:23:20.218 align:start position:0%
and of their rate about 75 to 80 percent
 
05:23:21.590 --> 05:23:21.600 align:start position:0%
of what they pay goes to the
 
05:23:24.650 --> 05:23:24.660 align:start position:0%
underfunding and 20 25 goes to the
 
05:23:27.530 --> 05:23:27.540 align:start position:0%
normal cost so the idea being that at
 
05:23:28.670 --> 05:23:28.680 align:start position:0%
some point in the future when the
 
05:23:30.890 --> 05:23:30.900 align:start position:0%
underfunding is paid down then you're
 
05:23:33.050 --> 05:23:33.060 align:start position:0%
only paying the normal cost and an
 
05:23:35.750 --> 05:23:35.760 align:start position:0%
employer contributions would be a
 
05:23:37.788 --> 05:23:37.798 align:start position:0%
quarter a quarter of what they are now
 
05:23:41.390 --> 05:23:41.400 align:start position:0%
but that's down the road quite a bit
 
05:23:43.788 --> 05:23:43.798 align:start position:0%
thank you that answers my question
 
05:23:45.890 --> 05:23:45.900 align:start position:0%
you're welcome
 
05:23:48.410 --> 05:23:48.420 align:start position:0%
any further questions
 
05:23:51.170 --> 05:23:51.180 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards I I thank you Mr
 
05:23:55.310 --> 05:23:55.320 align:start position:0%
chair I I that's fascinating so
 
05:23:55.320 --> 05:23:55.970 align:start position:0%
chair I I that's fascinating so
um

05:23:55.970 --> 05:23:55.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:23:58.250 --> 05:23:58.260 align:start position:0%
so to the extent that we can accelerate
 
05:24:01.430 --> 05:24:01.440 align:start position:0%
the payoff of the unfunded liability on
 
05:24:03.948 --> 05:24:03.958 align:start position:0%
that celebration date
 
05:24:07.750 --> 05:24:07.760 align:start position:0%
the municipalities and other payers
 
05:24:11.270 --> 05:24:11.280 align:start position:0%
they they get an enormous benefit from
 
05:24:13.730 --> 05:24:13.740 align:start position:0%
being able to reduce their payments
 
05:24:15.830 --> 05:24:15.840 align:start position:0%
correct that's what I think I heard you
 
05:24:17.570 --> 05:24:17.580 align:start position:0%
say yeah and it's not a cliff they don't
 
05:24:20.030 --> 05:24:20.040 align:start position:0%
have to rates are going to gradually go
 
05:24:22.310 --> 05:24:22.320 align:start position:0%
down as we get closer and closer to
 
05:24:24.230 --> 05:24:24.240 align:start position:0%
being fully funded okay so that was
 
05:24:26.390 --> 05:24:26.400 align:start position:0%
going to be my question I mean is it is
 
05:24:28.190 --> 05:24:28.200 align:start position:0%
it because you're on this Actuarial
 
05:24:32.230 --> 05:24:32.240 align:start position:0%
decline path if we are beating your plan
 
05:24:35.868 --> 05:24:35.878 align:start position:0%
do the municipalities benefit as
 
05:24:38.330 --> 05:24:38.340 align:start position:0%
progress is being incremental progress
 
05:24:40.788 --> 05:24:40.798 align:start position:0%
is being made over time yes rates are
 
05:24:44.390 --> 05:24:44.400 align:start position:0%
reset by the actuary every two years
 
05:24:47.030 --> 05:24:47.040 align:start position:0%
based on evaluation that's done every
 
05:24:51.230 --> 05:24:51.240 align:start position:0%
two years so for instance the rates that
 
05:24:54.590 --> 05:24:54.600 align:start position:0%
are going into effect on July 1st were
 
05:24:56.570 --> 05:24:56.580 align:start position:0%
set two years ago
 
05:25:00.110 --> 05:25:00.120 align:start position:0%
uh in anticipation based on an Actuarial
 
05:25:03.288 --> 05:25:03.298 align:start position:0%
study from several years ago we'll do a
 
05:25:06.708 --> 05:25:06.718 align:start position:0%
new Actuarial study uh this year in
 
05:25:09.410 --> 05:25:09.420 align:start position:0%
reset rates next summer
 
05:25:09.420 --> 05:25:11.030 align:start position:0%
reset rates next summer
um

05:25:11.030 --> 05:25:11.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:25:15.170 --> 05:25:15.180 align:start position:0%
for the next biennium rather and the new
 
05:25:18.170 --> 05:25:18.180 align:start position:0%
rates going into effect in July are
 
05:25:20.810 --> 05:25:20.820 align:start position:0%
lower than the current rates so when
 
05:25:22.730 --> 05:25:22.740 align:start position:0%
this plan was put into place the way it
 
05:25:25.250 --> 05:25:25.260 align:start position:0%
was designed and understood is that in
 
05:25:27.590 --> 05:25:27.600 align:start position:0%
the beginning rates were going to go up
 
05:25:29.330 --> 05:25:29.340 align:start position:0%
but at some point you're going to hit a
 
05:25:30.708 --> 05:25:30.718 align:start position:0%
break-even point
 
05:25:32.628 --> 05:25:32.638 align:start position:0%
and they're going to start going down
 
05:25:35.570 --> 05:25:35.580 align:start position:0%
and we believe that break-even point is
 
05:25:37.970 --> 05:25:37.980 align:start position:0%
this year barring
 
05:25:40.190 --> 05:25:40.200 align:start position:0%
things that can affect that with like
 
05:25:43.310 --> 05:25:43.320 align:start position:0%
changes in demographics or a stock
 
05:25:46.070 --> 05:25:46.080 align:start position:0%
investment crash with that a huge a huge
 
05:25:48.230 --> 05:25:48.240 align:start position:0%
stock market crash like 08 would add to
 
05:25:50.090 --> 05:25:50.100 align:start position:0%
the underfunding and push out the date
 
05:25:52.310 --> 05:25:52.320 align:start position:0%
yeah I I appreciate your answer thank
 
05:25:54.890 --> 05:25:54.900 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:58.010 --> 05:25:58.020 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:59.990 --> 05:26:00.000 align:start position:0%
uh representative Petrie
 
05:26:02.990 --> 05:26:03.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh
 
05:26:07.490 --> 05:26:07.500 align:start position:0%
see two thousand uh what 10 I guess the
 
05:26:07.500 --> 05:26:08.570 align:start position:0%
see two thousand uh what 10 I guess the
uh

05:26:08.570 --> 05:26:08.580 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:26:13.190 --> 05:26:13.200 align:start position:0%
we were in trouble so the liability has
 
05:26:16.310 --> 05:26:16.320 align:start position:0%
gone down to around 4.99 billion is that
 
05:26:18.350 --> 05:26:18.360 align:start position:0%
the stock market fluctuations causing it
 
05:26:21.650 --> 05:26:21.660 align:start position:0%
to go back into 5.7 uh well a couple of
 
05:26:23.208 --> 05:26:23.218 align:start position:0%
things have affected that since the plan
 
05:26:25.670 --> 05:26:25.680 align:start position:0%
first went into effect
 
05:26:25.680 --> 05:26:26.390 align:start position:0%
first went into effect
um

05:26:26.390 --> 05:26:26.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:26:29.150 --> 05:26:29.160 align:start position:0%
one is yeah the stock market you know
 
05:26:30.670 --> 05:26:30.680 align:start position:0%
the crash in 08
 
05:26:33.830 --> 05:26:33.840 align:start position:0%
increased the underfunding
 
05:26:36.288 --> 05:26:36.298 align:start position:0%
um because you obviously didn't meet our
 
05:26:39.610 --> 05:26:39.620 align:start position:0%
expectations as to investment earnings
 
05:26:42.530 --> 05:26:42.540 align:start position:0%
in addition uh
 
05:26:45.770 --> 05:26:45.780 align:start position:0%
we do other Actuarial studies every four
 
05:26:47.090 --> 05:26:47.100 align:start position:0%
or five years
 
05:26:49.850 --> 05:26:49.860 align:start position:0%
that review the underlying assumptions
 
05:26:52.010 --> 05:26:52.020 align:start position:0%
and there were changes in the underlying
 
05:26:54.070 --> 05:26:54.080 align:start position:0%
assumptions for instance
 
05:26:57.170 --> 05:26:57.180 align:start position:0%
and these assumptions what Drive the
 
05:26:59.750 --> 05:26:59.760 align:start position:0%
contribution rates and and the estimates
 
05:27:01.490 --> 05:27:01.500 align:start position:0%
of how long it takes to pay off their
 
05:27:04.510 --> 05:27:04.520 align:start position:0%
underfunding we reduce the
 
05:27:07.970 --> 05:27:07.980 align:start position:0%
expected investment return twice since
 
05:27:11.570 --> 05:27:11.580 align:start position:0%
then it was eight it's now 6.25 which is
 
05:27:14.330 --> 05:27:14.340 align:start position:0%
more realistic given the markets these
 
05:27:17.628 --> 05:27:17.638 align:start position:0%
days we also changed some demographics
 
05:27:20.270 --> 05:27:20.280 align:start position:0%
in terms of expected payroll growth
 
05:27:23.030 --> 05:27:23.040 align:start position:0%
especially amongst teachers that's a
 
05:27:25.550 --> 05:27:25.560 align:start position:0%
cohort that's not growing as fast as it
 
05:27:28.430 --> 05:27:28.440 align:start position:0%
was anticipated when when this plan
 
05:27:30.530 --> 05:27:30.540 align:start position:0%
first went into place in its future
 
05:27:33.288 --> 05:27:33.298 align:start position:0%
growth and payroll on which the
 
05:27:36.470 --> 05:27:36.480 align:start position:0%
contributions are paid that are part
 
05:27:38.708 --> 05:27:38.718 align:start position:0%
part of on paying down the underfunding
 
05:27:42.230 --> 05:27:42.240 align:start position:0%
so market and changes in Actuarial
 
05:27:45.288 --> 05:27:45.298 align:start position:0%
assumptions are why the
 
05:27:45.298 --> 05:27:46.010 align:start position:0%
assumptions are why the
um

05:27:46.010 --> 05:27:46.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:27:48.410 --> 05:27:48.420 align:start position:0%
the the underfunding is
 
05:27:50.930 --> 05:27:50.940 align:start position:0%
a larger dollar amount close to the
 
05:27:52.550 --> 05:27:52.560 align:start position:0%
dollar amount it was 10 years ago but as
 
05:27:55.368 --> 05:27:55.378 align:start position:0%
a percentage it's the underfunding ratio
 
05:27:59.330 --> 05:27:59.340 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:00.770 --> 05:28:00.780 align:start position:0%
because again when you change those
 
05:28:02.330 --> 05:28:02.340 align:start position:0%
underlying assumptions you're increasing
 
05:28:04.730 --> 05:28:04.740 align:start position:0%
your liabilities
 
05:28:04.740 --> 05:28:06.250 align:start position:0%
your liabilities
yeah

05:28:06.250 --> 05:28:06.260 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:28:08.868 --> 05:28:08.878 align:start position:0%
I'll just caveat by saying I'm a lawyer
 
05:28:11.208 --> 05:28:11.218 align:start position:0%
not an actuarian I usually try to stay
 
05:28:13.070 --> 05:28:13.080 align:start position:0%
away from the math but
 
05:28:15.230 --> 05:28:15.240 align:start position:0%
representative lilac
 
05:28:17.090 --> 05:28:17.100 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
05:28:19.550 --> 05:28:19.560 align:start position:0%
I try to read the retirement system
 
05:28:22.788 --> 05:28:22.798 align:start position:0%
report every year and I see the the
 
05:28:26.330 --> 05:28:26.340 align:start position:0%
Investments that you have and I see
 
05:28:29.208 --> 05:28:29.218 align:start position:0%
very few of them have much of a return
 
05:28:32.030 --> 05:28:32.040 align:start position:0%
and then at the bottom it says assumed
 
05:28:34.010 --> 05:28:34.020 align:start position:0%
rate six and a half percent
 
05:28:36.230 --> 05:28:36.240 align:start position:0%
but when you add them up it's far lower
 
05:28:39.050 --> 05:28:39.060 align:start position:0%
but you never publish the actual return
 
05:28:42.890 --> 05:28:42.900 align:start position:0%
Why Not unless it happens to be 29 most
 
05:28:45.310 --> 05:28:45.320 align:start position:0%
the time you leave it blank
 
05:28:47.750 --> 05:28:47.760 align:start position:0%
respectfully sir that's incorrect we're
 
05:28:49.610 --> 05:28:49.620 align:start position:0%
required by the government Accounting
 
05:28:52.128 --> 05:28:52.138 align:start position:0%
Standards Board to prepare an annual
 
05:28:56.330 --> 05:28:56.340 align:start position:0%
report and where we do break down our
 
05:28:59.448 --> 05:28:59.458 align:start position:0%
investment returns by asset class by
 
05:29:04.430 --> 05:29:04.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:05.830 --> 05:29:05.840 align:start position:0%
we also
 
05:29:09.110 --> 05:29:09.120 align:start position:0%
and give the overall that's incorrect
 
05:29:11.330 --> 05:29:11.340 align:start position:0%
sir there's a bottom line on that every
 
05:29:13.788 --> 05:29:13.798 align:start position:0%
year in the report we also have uh
 
05:29:17.570 --> 05:29:17.580 align:start position:0%
monthly meetings with our Board of
 
05:29:21.530 --> 05:29:21.540 align:start position:0%
Trustees in the state of investment
 
05:29:24.650 --> 05:29:24.660 align:start position:0%
Affairs is done at each of those
 
05:29:26.930 --> 05:29:26.940 align:start position:0%
meetings and materials are publicly
 
05:29:31.010 --> 05:29:31.020 align:start position:0%
available on our website that show month
 
05:29:33.170 --> 05:29:33.180 align:start position:0%
to month what our investment returns are
 
05:29:37.430 --> 05:29:37.440 align:start position:0%
broken down and in the aggregate
 
05:29:38.930 --> 05:29:38.940 align:start position:0%
I'll have to get out the report you'll
 
05:29:40.310 --> 05:29:40.320 align:start position:0%
have to show it to me it's not on the
 
05:29:44.448 --> 05:29:44.458 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:47.770 --> 05:29:47.780 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:51.708 --> 05:29:51.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:55.330 --> 05:29:55.340 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:58.128 --> 05:29:58.138 align:start position:0%
you're welcome sorry I got distracted I
 
05:30:03.288 --> 05:30:03.298 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:13.730 --> 05:30:13.740 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:15.650 --> 05:30:15.660 align:start position:0%
good afternoon again committee members
 
05:30:17.390 --> 05:30:17.400 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is Catherine Heck
 
05:30:18.530 --> 05:30:18.540 align:start position:0%
from The New Hampshire Municipal
 
05:30:20.690 --> 05:30:20.700 align:start position:0%
Association and I will be incredibly
 
05:30:22.788 --> 05:30:22.798 align:start position:0%
brief and that we support this
 
05:30:25.070 --> 05:30:25.080 align:start position:0%
legislation and the long-term goal that
 
05:30:26.510 --> 05:30:26.520 align:start position:0%
it will achieve and I think
 
05:30:28.490 --> 05:30:28.500 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards
 
05:30:30.770 --> 05:30:30.780 align:start position:0%
um already testified already captured
 
05:30:33.050 --> 05:30:33.060 align:start position:0%
all of my testimony in that as the
 
05:30:34.970 --> 05:30:34.980 align:start position:0%
faster we pay this down the large
 
05:30:37.550 --> 05:30:37.560 align:start position:0%
percentage is 75 percent we're going to
 
05:30:39.288 --> 05:30:39.298 align:start position:0%
see maybe not in the next two years it
 
05:30:41.810 --> 05:30:41.820 align:start position:0%
won't be an immediate response to our
 
05:30:44.448 --> 05:30:44.458 align:start position:0%
local taxation but over time we're going
 
05:30:46.430 --> 05:30:46.440 align:start position:0%
to watch the rates go down and that will
 
05:30:48.050 --> 05:30:48.060 align:start position:0%
be a savings to municipalities and
 
05:30:50.868 --> 05:30:50.878 align:start position:0%
therefore a savings to our taxpayers so
 
05:30:52.610 --> 05:30:52.620 align:start position:0%
I think you captured all that and how
 
05:30:54.590 --> 05:30:54.600 align:start position:0%
you described it sir so I won't I'll
 
05:30:56.510 --> 05:30:56.520 align:start position:0%
waste the committee's time do you have
 
05:30:58.910 --> 05:30:58.920 align:start position:0%
any questions for me any questions from
 
05:31:01.550 --> 05:31:01.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:05.750 --> 05:31:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:16.250 --> 05:31:16.260 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:18.050 --> 05:31:18.060 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chairman members
 
05:31:19.190 --> 05:31:19.200 align:start position:0%
of the committee for the record my name
 
05:31:21.230 --> 05:31:21.240 align:start position:0%
is Dan McGuire I represent the town of
 
05:31:23.930 --> 05:31:23.940 align:start position:0%
Epsom and I'm a supporter of this and
 
05:31:26.270 --> 05:31:26.280 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor of this bill maybe I'll start
 
05:31:28.730 --> 05:31:28.740 align:start position:0%
by answering representative Mooney's and
 
05:31:31.430 --> 05:31:31.440 align:start position:0%
and representative Edwards questions so
 
05:31:33.170 --> 05:31:33.180 align:start position:0%
I think representative Mooney asked for
 
05:31:35.390 --> 05:31:35.400 align:start position:0%
sort of a specific example of how the
 
05:31:36.708 --> 05:31:36.718 align:start position:0%
bill would work
 
05:31:40.490 --> 05:31:40.500 align:start position:0%
let's suppose that for the biennium the
 
05:31:42.830 --> 05:31:42.840 align:start position:0%
general fund is three and a half billion
 
05:31:42.840 --> 05:31:44.150 align:start position:0%
general fund is three and a half billion
dollars

05:31:44.150 --> 05:31:44.160 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
05:31:44.160 --> 05:31:45.288 align:start position:0%
dollars
okay

05:31:45.288 --> 05:31:45.298 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:31:47.390 --> 05:31:47.400 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
05:31:50.868 --> 05:31:50.878 align:start position:0%
would take effect if the rainy day fund
 
05:31:55.010 --> 05:31:55.020 align:start position:0%
is a tenth of that or higher so if it's
 
05:31:57.890 --> 05:31:57.900 align:start position:0%
350 million dollars in the rainy day
 
05:31:59.930 --> 05:31:59.940 align:start position:0%
fund or more
 
05:32:02.628 --> 05:32:02.638 align:start position:0%
then the then the if the bill would
 
05:32:03.948 --> 05:32:03.958 align:start position:0%
would act
 
05:32:09.190 --> 05:32:09.200 align:start position:0%
okay that's that's lines uh 16 and so on
 
05:32:13.670 --> 05:32:13.680 align:start position:0%
also if the unfunded liability is
 
05:32:17.150 --> 05:32:17.160 align:start position:0%
exhausted then line 19 says the bill
 
05:32:19.850 --> 05:32:19.860 align:start position:0%
would not take effect right so this only
 
05:32:22.310 --> 05:32:22.320 align:start position:0%
would would happen if we have a very
 
05:32:25.010 --> 05:32:25.020 align:start position:0%
healthy rainy day fund 350 million
 
05:32:28.250 --> 05:32:28.260 align:start position:0%
dollars in this example right and we
 
05:32:29.628 --> 05:32:29.638 align:start position:0%
have a surplus
 
05:32:32.390 --> 05:32:32.400 align:start position:0%
so if we have a surplus where that
 
05:32:34.190 --> 05:32:34.200 align:start position:0%
Surplus would be going into the rainy
 
05:32:37.310 --> 05:32:37.320 align:start position:0%
day fund this would redirect three
 
05:32:40.788 --> 05:32:40.798 align:start position:0%
quarters of it to the retirement fund to
 
05:32:43.310 --> 05:32:43.320 align:start position:0%
pay off the unfunded liability
 
05:32:43.320 --> 05:32:44.510 align:start position:0%
pay off the unfunded liability
okay

05:32:44.510 --> 05:32:44.520 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:32:46.850 --> 05:32:46.860 align:start position:0%
so in some sense you can think of this
 
05:32:49.610 --> 05:32:49.620 align:start position:0%
as a slow acting version of house bill
 
05:32:54.650 --> 05:32:54.660 align:start position:0%
50. because this does help both state
 
05:32:58.250 --> 05:32:58.260 align:start position:0%
taxpayers and municipalities much more
 
05:33:01.910 --> 05:33:01.920 align:start position:0%
municipalities than State because it
 
05:33:05.270 --> 05:33:05.280 align:start position:0%
reduces their debts so
 
05:33:07.910 --> 05:33:07.920 align:start position:0%
um of of the totality of employee of
 
05:33:11.208 --> 05:33:11.218 align:start position:0%
government employees in the state if I
 
05:33:13.430 --> 05:33:13.440 align:start position:0%
remember the numbers right the state
 
05:33:16.570 --> 05:33:16.580 align:start position:0%
employs 17 percent and municipalities
 
05:33:20.090 --> 05:33:20.100 align:start position:0%
including teachers and so on employ 83
 
05:33:23.090 --> 05:33:23.100 align:start position:0%
percent right so of the unfunded the
 
05:33:26.090 --> 05:33:26.100 align:start position:0%
unfunded liability is one giant blob for
 
05:33:28.368 --> 05:33:28.378 align:start position:0%
everybody it's not
 
05:33:30.948 --> 05:33:30.958 align:start position:0%
we don't think of it as so much as the
 
05:33:32.990 --> 05:33:33.000 align:start position:0%
state's responsibility and so much as
 
05:33:34.330 --> 05:33:34.340 align:start position:0%
this particular
 
05:33:36.410 --> 05:33:36.420 align:start position:0%
municipality's responsibility and so on
 
05:33:39.110 --> 05:33:39.120 align:start position:0%
it's a total unfunded liability so when
 
05:33:41.570 --> 05:33:41.580 align:start position:0%
we put money into it we help all of
 
05:33:45.590 --> 05:33:45.600 align:start position:0%
those Employers in a sense equally okay
 
05:33:46.970 --> 05:33:46.980 align:start position:0%
all right
 
05:33:51.410 --> 05:33:51.420 align:start position:0%
now let me go into the specifics of why
 
05:33:55.010 --> 05:33:55.020 align:start position:0%
we need this and I handed out two pieces
 
05:33:56.690 --> 05:33:56.700 align:start position:0%
of paper that look like giant
 
05:33:56.700 --> 05:33:58.970 align:start position:0%
of paper that look like giant
spreadsheets

05:33:58.970 --> 05:33:58.980 align:start position:0%
spreadsheets
 
05:34:02.868 --> 05:34:02.878 align:start position:0%
um because as an engineer I like numbers
 
05:34:05.150 --> 05:34:05.160 align:start position:0%
so let's start with the one that says
 
05:34:08.030 --> 05:34:08.040 align:start position:0%
2021 at the top okay
 
05:34:11.990 --> 05:34:12.000 align:start position:0%
so this is I got this from Mr Carlin of
 
05:34:14.628 --> 05:34:14.638 align:start position:0%
the retirement system just recently
 
05:34:16.670 --> 05:34:16.680 align:start position:0%
and this shows what the what the current
 
05:34:18.890 --> 05:34:18.900 align:start position:0%
unfunded liability is so if you look at
 
05:34:22.430 --> 05:34:22.440 align:start position:0%
the line that starts 2022 and look over
 
05:34:25.368 --> 05:34:25.378 align:start position:0%
it's uaal that's that's the unfunded
 
05:34:29.470 --> 05:34:29.480 align:start position:0%
liability is currently uh
 
05:34:33.890 --> 05:34:33.900 align:start position:0%
5.723 billion dollars okay and this
 
05:34:37.070 --> 05:34:37.080 align:start position:0%
shows this document purports to show how
 
05:34:40.010 --> 05:34:40.020 align:start position:0%
that's going to change over time
 
05:34:40.020 --> 05:34:41.690 align:start position:0%
that's going to change over time
so

05:34:41.690 --> 05:34:41.700 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:34:41.700 --> 05:34:42.230 align:start position:0%
so
um

05:34:42.230 --> 05:34:42.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:34:45.350 --> 05:34:45.360 align:start position:0%
this is a prediction of what's going to
 
05:34:47.628 --> 05:34:47.638 align:start position:0%
happen all right and as we all know
 
05:34:49.750 --> 05:34:49.760 align:start position:0%
predictions are really difficult
 
05:34:53.510 --> 05:34:53.520 align:start position:0%
especially about the future so
 
05:34:53.520 --> 05:34:55.190 align:start position:0%
especially about the future so
um

05:34:55.190 --> 05:34:55.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:34:58.250 --> 05:34:58.260 align:start position:0%
so look at so it you know it looks this
 
05:35:00.110 --> 05:35:00.120 align:start position:0%
looks accurate right it's black and
 
05:35:03.170 --> 05:35:03.180 align:start position:0%
white it's got four digits of of numbers
 
05:35:07.128 --> 05:35:07.138 align:start position:0%
on everything and and it looks like we
 
05:35:09.770 --> 05:35:09.780 align:start position:0%
will be nicely slowly reducing the
 
05:35:11.990 --> 05:35:12.000 align:start position:0%
unfunded liability down to zero when we
 
05:35:16.250 --> 05:35:16.260 align:start position:0%
get to 2043 or 2041 or whatever it is
 
05:35:20.030 --> 05:35:20.040 align:start position:0%
but what what thanks to Mr Hoffman I
 
05:35:23.690 --> 05:35:23.700 align:start position:0%
found or we found he found is the page
 
05:35:27.650 --> 05:35:27.660 align:start position:0%
that starts 2007 the other page
 
05:35:29.448 --> 05:35:29.458 align:start position:0%
so that's what this is the equivalent
 
05:35:31.190 --> 05:35:31.200 align:start position:0%
piece of paper that was given to the
 
05:35:35.270 --> 05:35:35.280 align:start position:0%
legislature in 2007 when we decided to
 
05:35:37.368 --> 05:35:37.378 align:start position:0%
do something about the unfunded
 
05:35:37.378 --> 05:35:38.570 align:start position:0%
do something about the unfunded
liability

05:35:38.570 --> 05:35:38.580 align:start position:0%
liability
 
05:35:40.368 --> 05:35:40.378 align:start position:0%
okay so it's the same sort of thing if
 
05:35:43.310 --> 05:35:43.320 align:start position:0%
you look at it 2008 the unfunded
 
05:35:46.788 --> 05:35:46.798 align:start position:0%
liability we slide over there uaal
 
05:35:50.690 --> 05:35:50.700 align:start position:0%
beginning of year uh 2 billion 2.4
 
05:35:52.128 --> 05:35:52.138 align:start position:0%
billion dollars
 
05:35:52.138 --> 05:35:53.690 align:start position:0%
billion dollars
okay

05:35:53.690 --> 05:35:53.700 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:35:55.850 --> 05:35:55.860 align:start position:0%
and you're gonna you're gonna see what
 
05:35:57.890 --> 05:35:57.900 align:start position:0%
we just heard that it's projected to go
 
05:36:01.850 --> 05:36:01.860 align:start position:0%
up and a bit right it goes up a bit and
 
05:36:03.830 --> 05:36:03.840 align:start position:0%
it goes if you look down that column
 
05:36:07.448 --> 05:36:07.458 align:start position:0%
it's supposed to Peak at looks like
 
05:36:11.448 --> 05:36:11.458 align:start position:0%
3.137 billion dollars in 2024 and then
 
05:36:13.670 --> 05:36:13.680 align:start position:0%
by the time it gets to 2039 it's back
 
05:36:14.930 --> 05:36:14.940 align:start position:0%
down to zero
 
05:36:14.940 --> 05:36:16.190 align:start position:0%
down to zero
okay

05:36:16.190 --> 05:36:16.200 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:36:18.708 --> 05:36:18.718 align:start position:0%
so how does that purport with what we
 
05:36:20.930 --> 05:36:20.940 align:start position:0%
know now know happened in those
 
05:36:24.230 --> 05:36:24.240 align:start position:0%
intervening years so let's look at
 
05:36:27.890 --> 05:36:27.900 align:start position:0%
um year 13 on this 2007 page which is
 
05:36:27.900 --> 05:36:29.930 align:start position:0%
um year 13 on this 2007 page which is
2022.

05:36:29.930 --> 05:36:29.940 align:start position:0%
2022.
 
05:36:33.050 --> 05:36:33.060 align:start position:0%
right so what this page says said to the
 
05:36:35.150 --> 05:36:35.160 align:start position:0%
legislature in those days was that
 
05:36:38.570 --> 05:36:38.580 align:start position:0%
today's unfunded liability would be by
 
05:36:40.208 --> 05:36:40.218 align:start position:0%
their predictions
 
05:36:43.070 --> 05:36:43.080 align:start position:0%
3.125 billion dollars
 
05:36:45.970 --> 05:36:45.980 align:start position:0%
well we now know it's not it's
 
05:36:48.470 --> 05:36:48.480 align:start position:0%
5.723 billion dollars
 
05:36:50.690 --> 05:36:50.700 align:start position:0%
okay those two numbers are not very
 
05:36:50.700 --> 05:36:53.208 align:start position:0%
okay those two numbers are not very
close

05:36:53.208 --> 05:36:53.218 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:55.070 --> 05:36:55.080 align:start position:0%
um and so
 
05:36:58.490 --> 05:36:58.500 align:start position:0%
it's very tough making a prediction and
 
05:37:00.470 --> 05:37:00.480 align:start position:0%
in and on top of that
 
05:37:02.690 --> 05:37:02.700 align:start position:0%
I went to the
 
05:37:05.390 --> 05:37:05.400 align:start position:0%
um the pension uh overview hearing that
 
05:37:07.910 --> 05:37:07.920 align:start position:0%
the Edna committee had that was where
 
05:37:09.830 --> 05:37:09.840 align:start position:0%
that where uh Mr Carlin of the
 
05:37:12.288 --> 05:37:12.298 align:start position:0%
retirement system gave a summary of how
 
05:37:14.390 --> 05:37:14.400 align:start position:0%
the pension system works and he said
 
05:37:15.708 --> 05:37:15.718 align:start position:0%
something in that hearing that I thought
 
05:37:18.410 --> 05:37:18.420 align:start position:0%
was very profound he said he was asked
 
05:37:21.470 --> 05:37:21.480 align:start position:0%
why do we have this problem right where
 
05:37:24.470 --> 05:37:24.480 align:start position:0%
did this unfunded liability come from so
 
05:37:26.570 --> 05:37:26.580 align:start position:0%
even the people that had this unfunded
 
05:37:29.030 --> 05:37:29.040 align:start position:0%
liability thought maybe we'll get up to
 
05:37:30.650 --> 05:37:30.660 align:start position:0%
the three billion dollar Mark and then
 
05:37:32.930 --> 05:37:32.940 align:start position:0%
we'll start coming back right so why are
 
05:37:36.350 --> 05:37:36.360 align:start position:0%
we at 5 billion and what he said was I
 
05:37:37.850 --> 05:37:37.860 align:start position:0%
thought was pretty profound it was about
 
05:37:37.860 --> 05:37:39.110 align:start position:0%
thought was pretty profound it was about
about

05:37:39.110 --> 05:37:39.120 align:start position:0%
about
 
05:37:42.410 --> 05:37:42.420 align:start position:0%
um he said one of the problems is when
 
05:37:45.050 --> 05:37:45.060 align:start position:0%
you give the legislature a set of
 
05:37:45.060 --> 05:37:46.788 align:start position:0%
you give the legislature a set of
choices

05:37:46.788 --> 05:37:46.798 align:start position:0%
choices
 
05:37:50.330 --> 05:37:50.340 align:start position:0%
they're going to pick the cheapest one
 
05:37:54.410 --> 05:37:54.420 align:start position:0%
okay so they didn't do back in those
 
05:37:56.868 --> 05:37:56.878 align:start position:0%
days and and through the present we
 
05:38:00.530 --> 05:38:00.540 align:start position:0%
didn't do maybe the smartest thing we
 
05:38:02.930 --> 05:38:02.940 align:start position:0%
did at every step of the way the
 
05:38:02.940 --> 05:38:03.830 align:start position:0%
did at every step of the way the
cheapest

05:38:03.830 --> 05:38:03.840 align:start position:0%
cheapest
 
05:38:06.410 --> 05:38:06.420 align:start position:0%
thing right because we have we have a
 
05:38:10.128 --> 05:38:10.138 align:start position:0%
lot of incentive to keep taxes low
 
05:38:12.948 --> 05:38:12.958 align:start position:0%
right and so what happened was
 
05:38:15.288 --> 05:38:15.298 align:start position:0%
the cheapest thing didn't turn out to be
 
05:38:18.530 --> 05:38:18.540 align:start position:0%
the best it it turned out to be there's
 
05:38:21.410 --> 05:38:21.420 align:start position:0%
some some sort of Rosy uh expectations
 
05:38:24.288 --> 05:38:24.298 align:start position:0%
so for example uh let's just look at
 
05:38:26.270 --> 05:38:26.280 align:start position:0%
payroll for example if you look on that
 
05:38:29.690 --> 05:38:29.700 align:start position:0%
same line line 13 on the page 2007
 
05:38:33.770 --> 05:38:33.780 align:start position:0%
it it expected that today we would have
 
05:38:38.948 --> 05:38:38.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:42.590 --> 05:38:42.600 align:start position:0%
4.249 billion dollars right but if we
 
05:38:45.110 --> 05:38:45.120 align:start position:0%
look at today's picture on on the other
 
05:38:48.470 --> 05:38:48.480 align:start position:0%
page our current payroll is 3.049
 
05:38:51.050 --> 05:38:51.060 align:start position:0%
billion dollars you see what I mean so
 
05:38:53.448 --> 05:38:53.458 align:start position:0%
in those days they expected that payroll
 
05:38:56.628 --> 05:38:56.638 align:start position:0%
was going to be going up add infinitum
 
05:38:58.850 --> 05:38:58.860 align:start position:0%
if you look at the bottom of that 2007
 
05:39:02.510 --> 05:39:02.520 align:start position:0%
page they expected that by 2039 payroll
 
05:39:04.970 --> 05:39:04.980 align:start position:0%
will be almost nine billion dollars
 
05:39:07.010 --> 05:39:07.020 align:start position:0%
so that they thought a lot of people are
 
05:39:08.628 --> 05:39:08.638 align:start position:0%
going to be employed and a lot of people
 
05:39:10.190 --> 05:39:10.200 align:start position:0%
are going to be dumping money into the
 
05:39:12.350 --> 05:39:12.360 align:start position:0%
system well that's not happening right
 
05:39:15.050 --> 05:39:15.060 align:start position:0%
they didn't know that
 
05:39:16.850 --> 05:39:16.860 align:start position:0%
um we're going to level off on
 
05:39:20.208 --> 05:39:20.218 align:start position:0%
unemployment they didn't know that uh
 
05:39:22.128 --> 05:39:22.138 align:start position:0%
kids are not going to be born and
 
05:39:23.628 --> 05:39:23.638 align:start position:0%
therefore we don't need quite so many
 
05:39:27.350 --> 05:39:27.360 align:start position:0%
teachers and all that sort of stuff so
 
05:39:30.410 --> 05:39:30.420 align:start position:0%
um so those predictions are very very
 
05:39:33.410 --> 05:39:33.420 align:start position:0%
difficult and haven't come true and so
 
05:39:35.448 --> 05:39:35.458 align:start position:0%
what that means is
 
05:39:39.250 --> 05:39:39.260 align:start position:0%
we ought to be paying off the the
 
05:39:42.470 --> 05:39:42.480 align:start position:0%
liability the the faster we pay it off
 
05:39:45.590 --> 05:39:45.600 align:start position:0%
the less we rely on unreliable
 
05:39:45.600 --> 05:39:46.910 align:start position:0%
the less we rely on unreliable
predictions

05:39:46.910 --> 05:39:46.920 align:start position:0%
predictions
 
05:39:49.490 --> 05:39:49.500 align:start position:0%
all right and and what is the what is
 
05:39:52.070 --> 05:39:52.080 align:start position:0%
this unfunded liability this unfunded
 
05:39:53.990 --> 05:39:54.000 align:start position:0%
liability is something that this
 
05:39:57.230 --> 05:39:57.240 align:start position:0%
Committee in my experience tries to
 
05:40:01.430 --> 05:40:01.440 align:start position:0%
avoid which is which is borrowing for
 
05:40:03.470 --> 05:40:03.480 align:start position:0%
current expenses
 
05:40:06.650 --> 05:40:06.660 align:start position:0%
right we we always want to pay our
 
05:40:10.368 --> 05:40:10.378 align:start position:0%
current expenses and not put him into
 
05:40:13.310 --> 05:40:13.320 align:start position:0%
debt okay but that's effectively what
 
05:40:15.770 --> 05:40:15.780 align:start position:0%
we've done here because the benefits
 
05:40:18.470 --> 05:40:18.480 align:start position:0%
that employees earn that's a current
 
05:40:21.530 --> 05:40:21.540 align:start position:0%
expense so what actually happened was in
 
05:40:23.510 --> 05:40:23.520 align:start position:0%
the past we had we had a lot of
 
05:40:25.730 --> 05:40:25.740 align:start position:0%
government employees and we didn't
 
05:40:28.310 --> 05:40:28.320 align:start position:0%
adequately fund their benefits
 
05:40:31.070 --> 05:40:31.080 align:start position:0%
and we borrowed it we we have we owe it
 
05:40:33.830 --> 05:40:33.840 align:start position:0%
it's the it's the unfunded liability
 
05:40:36.410 --> 05:40:36.420 align:start position:0%
all right and it's much more this this
 
05:40:40.310 --> 05:40:40.320 align:start position:0%
5.7 billion dollars all of the other
 
05:40:43.010 --> 05:40:43.020 align:start position:0%
state debt is about 1.2 billion dollars
 
05:40:45.110 --> 05:40:45.120 align:start position:0%
you add up all of our state bonds and
 
05:40:48.050 --> 05:40:48.060 align:start position:0%
all that stuff it's minor compared to
 
05:40:49.368 --> 05:40:49.378 align:start position:0%
this number
 
05:40:52.190 --> 05:40:52.200 align:start position:0%
so this number needs to be brought down
 
05:40:54.650 --> 05:40:54.660 align:start position:0%
as quickly as possible
 
05:40:59.330 --> 05:40:59.340 align:start position:0%
um and and House Bill 555 is a is a baby
 
05:41:02.390 --> 05:41:02.400 align:start position:0%
step in in that direction
 
05:41:04.970 --> 05:41:04.980 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
05:41:07.070 --> 05:41:07.080 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony are there
 
05:41:07.080 --> 05:41:08.150 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony are there
any questions

05:41:08.150 --> 05:41:08.160 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
05:41:10.990 --> 05:41:11.000 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards
 
05:41:14.930 --> 05:41:14.940 align:start position:0%
the first one is uh definitional I I
 
05:41:16.610 --> 05:41:16.620 align:start position:0%
want to understand the unfunded
 
05:41:19.670 --> 05:41:19.680 align:start position:0%
liability is is the unfunded liability
 
05:41:24.350 --> 05:41:24.360 align:start position:0%
that's in this uh column on uh unfunded
 
05:41:27.110 --> 05:41:27.120 align:start position:0%
Bill unfunded liability beginning of the
 
05:41:29.628 --> 05:41:29.638 align:start position:0%
year that column is that does that
 
05:41:31.070 --> 05:41:31.080 align:start position:0%
number represent
 
05:41:34.670 --> 05:41:34.680 align:start position:0%
the current year payments for pensions
 
05:41:37.850 --> 05:41:37.860 align:start position:0%
that are already being paid out or does
 
05:41:41.510 --> 05:41:41.520 align:start position:0%
that represent sort of uh you know like
 
05:41:44.330 --> 05:41:44.340 align:start position:0%
you would on a a balance sheet you'd put
 
05:41:46.550 --> 05:41:46.560 align:start position:0%
a liability down that you have to
 
05:41:49.010 --> 05:41:49.020 align:start position:0%
amortize over time and it's a it's more
 
05:41:52.610 --> 05:41:52.620 align:start position:0%
of a a paper number than it is a cash
 
05:41:54.288 --> 05:41:54.298 align:start position:0%
basis number
 
05:41:55.250 --> 05:41:55.260 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
05:41:57.170 --> 05:41:57.180 align:start position:0%
representative and it is more of the
 
05:42:00.410 --> 05:42:00.420 align:start position:0%
second than it is of the first so so the
 
05:42:03.350 --> 05:42:03.360 align:start position:0%
unfunded liability also itself depends
 
05:42:05.810 --> 05:42:05.820 align:start position:0%
on a lot of predictions right it
 
05:42:05.820 --> 05:42:06.948 align:start position:0%
on a lot of predictions right it
predicts

05:42:06.948 --> 05:42:06.958 align:start position:0%
predicts
 
05:42:09.890 --> 05:42:09.900 align:start position:0%
how many people are going to be in the
 
05:42:12.650 --> 05:42:12.660 align:start position:0%
system over time how long are they going
 
05:42:15.230 --> 05:42:15.240 align:start position:0%
to stay what benefits are they going to
 
05:42:19.430 --> 05:42:19.440 align:start position:0%
earn and also how much money as as uh
 
05:42:22.208 --> 05:42:22.218 align:start position:0%
the chairman pointed out how much of
 
05:42:26.208 --> 05:42:26.218 align:start position:0%
income is the is the assets of the funds
 
05:42:29.930 --> 05:42:29.940 align:start position:0%
going to receive over time right so we
 
05:42:32.690 --> 05:42:32.700 align:start position:0%
assume in law so first of all we don't
 
05:42:36.288 --> 05:42:36.298 align:start position:0%
even ask an actuary to predict what what
 
05:42:38.868 --> 05:42:38.878 align:start position:0%
income we're going to have we assume in
 
05:42:40.868 --> 05:42:40.878 align:start position:0%
law that our income is going to average
 
05:42:44.390 --> 05:42:44.400 align:start position:0%
6.75 percent per year in Maine they
 
05:42:46.910 --> 05:42:46.920 align:start position:0%
assume 6.5 percent they're more
 
05:42:48.948 --> 05:42:48.958 align:start position:0%
conservative in Maine than we are here
 
05:42:51.650 --> 05:42:51.660 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire in that respect
 
05:42:55.550 --> 05:42:55.560 align:start position:0%
follow up yeah follow up so there's like
 
05:42:57.650 --> 05:42:57.660 align:start position:0%
two or three questions in there that I'd
 
05:42:59.090 --> 05:42:59.100 align:start position:0%
want to ask you but I'll take those
 
05:42:59.100 --> 05:43:00.288 align:start position:0%
want to ask you but I'll take those
offline

05:43:00.288 --> 05:43:00.298 align:start position:0%
offline
 
05:43:00.298 --> 05:43:01.128 align:start position:0%
offline
um

05:43:01.128 --> 05:43:01.138 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:43:04.550 --> 05:43:04.560 align:start position:0%
the if I can remember them but uh what
 
05:43:06.830 --> 05:43:06.840 align:start position:0%
what I'd like to know now is back to the
 
05:43:08.570 --> 05:43:08.580 align:start position:0%
issue of Precedence
 
05:43:10.970 --> 05:43:10.980 align:start position:0%
you know like for example if this bill
 
05:43:12.730 --> 05:43:12.740 align:start position:0%
becomes law
 
05:43:16.670 --> 05:43:16.680 align:start position:0%
and a future legislature ends up with an
 
05:43:18.708 --> 05:43:18.718 align:start position:0%
economic crisis where revenues don't
 
05:43:21.230 --> 05:43:21.240 align:start position:0%
come in as projected and we have to use
 
05:43:23.150 --> 05:43:23.160 align:start position:0%
the rainy day fund for what we need the
 
05:43:25.190 --> 05:43:25.200 align:start position:0%
rainy day fund for
 
05:43:25.200 --> 05:43:26.810 align:start position:0%
rainy day fund for
uh

05:43:26.810 --> 05:43:26.820 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:43:31.490 --> 05:43:31.500 align:start position:0%
is that a year that the advance payments
 
05:43:34.010 --> 05:43:34.020 align:start position:0%
are held in advance that we don't that
 
05:43:36.530 --> 05:43:36.540 align:start position:0%
we we that is a year that we don't
 
05:43:39.530 --> 05:43:39.540 align:start position:0%
contribute any money towards the
 
05:43:41.750 --> 05:43:41.760 align:start position:0%
unfunded liability under this bill is
 
05:43:44.448 --> 05:43:44.458 align:start position:0%
that is that accurate essentially yes
 
05:43:46.910 --> 05:43:46.920 align:start position:0%
thank you so suppose our the rainy day
 
05:43:50.510 --> 05:43:50.520 align:start position:0%
fund was at 350 million yeah right and
 
05:43:52.610 --> 05:43:52.620 align:start position:0%
and for the past few couple of years we
 
05:43:54.110 --> 05:43:54.120 align:start position:0%
had been putting extra into the
 
05:43:56.810 --> 05:43:56.820 align:start position:0%
retirement system and all of a sudden a
 
05:43:59.510 --> 05:43:59.520 align:start position:0%
new big 150 million dollar debt comes
 
05:44:01.730 --> 05:44:01.740 align:start position:0%
along I believe what happened in the
 
05:44:04.010 --> 05:44:04.020 align:start position:0%
case you were talking about is it was
 
05:44:06.590 --> 05:44:06.600 align:start position:0%
explicitly taken out of the rainy day
 
05:44:08.930 --> 05:44:08.940 align:start position:0%
fund so the rainy day fund for this new
 
05:44:11.170 --> 05:44:11.180 align:start position:0%
150 million dollar debt
 
05:44:16.190 --> 05:44:16.200 align:start position:0%
expense would now be 200. all right so
 
05:44:18.590 --> 05:44:18.600 align:start position:0%
then none of this would happen until
 
05:44:21.350 --> 05:44:21.360 align:start position:0%
boom boom boom it got back up to the 350
 
05:44:21.360 --> 05:44:22.490 align:start position:0%
boom boom boom it got back up to the 350
level

05:44:22.490 --> 05:44:22.500 align:start position:0%
level
 
05:44:24.230 --> 05:44:24.240 align:start position:0%
right and then
 
05:44:26.270 --> 05:44:26.280 align:start position:0%
and then more money could be used for
 
05:44:28.670 --> 05:44:28.680 align:start position:0%
the retirement system so the political
 
05:44:31.548 --> 05:44:31.558 align:start position:0%
scenario there is any time we dipped
 
05:44:34.610 --> 05:44:34.620 align:start position:0%
into the rainy day fund it would be
 
05:44:38.990 --> 05:44:39.000 align:start position:0%
arguably true that we've increased
 
05:44:42.288 --> 05:44:42.298 align:start position:0%
property taxes by not allowing the the
 
05:44:44.448 --> 05:44:44.458 align:start position:0%
balance to be decreased thereby
 
05:44:46.910 --> 05:44:46.920 align:start position:0%
decreasing the contributions of the town
 
05:44:49.810 --> 05:44:49.820 align:start position:0%
if if we dip into the rainy day fund
 
05:44:53.930 --> 05:44:53.940 align:start position:0%
there's a good argument that we are not
 
05:44:55.788 --> 05:44:55.798 align:start position:0%
meeting our obligations to reducing
 
05:44:58.430 --> 05:44:58.440 align:start position:0%
property taxes
 
05:45:02.208 --> 05:45:02.218 align:start position:0%
yeah I guess that's that's a little bit
 
05:45:04.910 --> 05:45:04.920 align:start position:0%
of a step of us you know
 
05:45:07.970 --> 05:45:07.980 align:start position:0%
a stretch because
 
05:45:07.980 --> 05:45:08.628 align:start position:0%
a stretch because
um

05:45:08.628 --> 05:45:08.638 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:45:11.990 --> 05:45:12.000 align:start position:0%
currently in under current law
 
05:45:15.230 --> 05:45:15.240 align:start position:0%
we are not putting any extra into the
 
05:45:18.590 --> 05:45:18.600 align:start position:0%
into the retirement system right so by
 
05:45:21.770 --> 05:45:21.780 align:start position:0%
doing this sometimes we would be putting
 
05:45:24.708 --> 05:45:24.718 align:start position:0%
extra into the retirement system so the
 
05:45:26.510 --> 05:45:26.520 align:start position:0%
retirement system will under this bill
 
05:45:28.548 --> 05:45:28.558 align:start position:0%
will never be worse off than under
 
05:45:31.490 --> 05:45:31.500 align:start position:0%
current law right and so it's hard to
 
05:45:33.048 --> 05:45:33.058 align:start position:0%
say sometimes you're helping out
 
05:45:35.510 --> 05:45:35.520 align:start position:0%
property taxpayers by reducing their
 
05:45:37.910 --> 05:45:37.920 align:start position:0%
debt sometimes you're not well you know
 
05:45:40.310 --> 05:45:40.320 align:start position:0%
they're not worse off by that method I'm
 
05:45:42.110 --> 05:45:42.120 align:start position:0%
thinking too far ahead I'm wondering
 
05:45:44.330 --> 05:45:44.340 align:start position:0%
what the next broken promise is is yeah
 
05:45:46.030 --> 05:45:46.040 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:45:50.750 --> 05:45:50.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:52.670 --> 05:45:52.680 align:start position:0%
alrighty thank you representative thank
 
05:45:52.680 --> 05:45:54.890 align:start position:0%
alrighty thank you representative thank
you

05:45:54.890 --> 05:45:54.900 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:58.070 --> 05:45:58.080 align:start position:0%
any further discussion
 
05:46:01.910 --> 05:46:01.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:04.310 --> 05:46:04.320 align:start position:0%
members of the fiscal committee we're
 
05:46:06.350 --> 05:46:06.360 align:start position:0%
going to meet across the hall
 
05:46:08.750 --> 05:46:08.760 align:start position:0%
for a pre-fiscal meeting for tomorrow's
 
05:46:08.760 --> 05:46:11.650 align:start position:0%
for a pre-fiscal meeting for tomorrow's
meeting

05:46:11.650 --> 05:46:11.660 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:23.510 --> 05:46:23.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:26.570 --> 05:46:26.580 align:start position:0%
it does thank you yeah I looked at I
 
05:46:29.270 --> 05:46:29.280 align:start position:0%
looked at one online a year or two ago
 
05:46:32.510 --> 05:46:32.520 align:start position:0%
this this is your this is the summary
 
05:46:34.250 --> 05:46:34.260 align:start position:0%
all right so I should look for the
 
05:46:34.260 --> 05:46:36.558 align:start position:0%
all right so I should look for the
summary
