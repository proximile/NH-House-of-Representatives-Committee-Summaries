seat Pockets um keep in mind that these
 
00:15:28.629 --> 00:15:28.639 align:start position:0%
estimates are based on current law only
 
00:15:29.949 --> 00:15:29.959 align:start position:0%
it doesn't doesn't matter what bills are
 
00:15:32.509 --> 00:15:32.519 align:start position:0%
currently coming through the house um we
 
00:15:35.150 --> 00:15:35.160 align:start position:0%
only consider what is current law at the
 
00:15:37.670 --> 00:15:37.680 align:start position:0%
moment the committee started off the
 
00:15:40.309 --> 00:15:40.319 align:start position:0%
process by hearing testimony from State
 
00:15:42.389 --> 00:15:42.399 align:start position:0%

00:16:01.230 --> 00:16:01.240 align:start position:0%
background uh information as we can on
 
00:16:04.030 --> 00:16:04.040 align:start position:0%
the economics of what's happening and
 
00:16:06.309 --> 00:16:06.319 align:start position:0%
the committee also heard from economists
 
00:16:07.990 --> 00:16:08.000 align:start position:0%
and others from outside the state
 
00:16:09.629 --> 00:16:09.639 align:start position:0%

for Public Policy all this initial
 
00:16:27.509 --> 00:16:27.519 align:start position:0%
information gathering was to understand
 
00:16:28.949 --> 00:16:28.959 align:start position:0%
the state of the economy and the
 
00:16:31.230 --> 00:16:31.240 align:start position:0%
Direction it's headed over the next two
 
00:16:33.230 --> 00:16:33.240 align:start position:0%
years we still don't have our crystal
 
00:16:36.069 --> 00:16:36.079 align:start position:0%
ball so we use this as our best way of
 
00:16:38.550 --> 00:16:38.560 align:start position:0%
estimating what's going to happen next
 
00:16:40.949 --> 00:16:40.959 align:start position:0%
we heard from Individual state agencies
 
00:16:44.110 --> 00:16:44.120 align:start position:0%
regarding where they expected um their
 
00:16:47.829 --> 00:16:47.839 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 25 26 and 27 Revenue to end
 
00:16:50.230 --> 00:16:50.240 align:start position:0%
up the committee heard presentations of
 
00:16:51.790 --> 00:16:51.800 align:start position:0%
Revenue projections from the Department
 
00:16:53.910 --> 00:16:53.920 align:start position:0%

the Department of Transportation and
 
00:17:07.110 --> 00:17:07.120 align:start position:0%
fish and game so as you can see we've
 
00:17:09.990 --> 00:17:10.000 align:start position:0%
kind of panned uh span through the whole
 
00:17:12.110 --> 00:17:12.120 align:start position:0%
uh of these agencies to understand where
 
00:17:14.590 --> 00:17:14.600 align:start position:0%
do they think their estimates their high
 
00:17:17.390 --> 00:17:17.400 align:start position:0%
and low estimates are going to come we
 
00:17:19.270 --> 00:17:19.280 align:start position:0%
ask these agencies for those highs and
 
00:17:23.789 --> 00:17:23.799 align:start position:0%
lows for fiscal year 25 26 and 27 the
 
00:17:25.590 --> 00:17:25.600 align:start position:0%
committee then studied and considered
 
00:17:27.029 --> 00:17:27.039 align:start position:0%
those estimates in concert with the
 
00:17:28.950 --> 00:17:28.960 align:start position:0%
economic briefings
 
00:17:31.270 --> 00:17:31.280 align:start position:0%
listen to as well as our own economic
 
00:17:33.029 --> 00:17:33.039 align:start position:0%
information we've heard on news reports
 
00:17:35.470 --> 00:17:35.480 align:start position:0%
and newspapers we've read ultimately the
 
00:17:37.950 --> 00:17:37.960 align:start position:0%
revenue estimates that are summarized
 
00:17:39.669 --> 00:17:39.679 align:start position:0%
before you are the culmination of the
 
00:17:41.909 --> 00:17:41.919 align:start position:0%
work of the committee as it puts forth
 
00:17:44.070 --> 00:17:44.080 align:start position:0%
its best estimates for state revenue and
 
00:17:45.590 --> 00:17:45.600 align:start position:0%
its most honest
 
00:17:48.470 --> 00:17:48.480 align:start position:0%
estimates t uh trying to kick aside any
 
00:17:50.789 --> 00:17:50.799 align:start position:0%
political leanings just what is the
 
00:17:53.669 --> 00:17:53.679 align:start position:0%
reality of the estimates and that's how
 
00:17:56.190 --> 00:17:56.200 align:start position:0%
uh I would say we ended up with a uh
 
00:17:58.669 --> 00:17:58.679 align:start position:0%
complete uh committee vote of I believe
 
00:18:01.390 --> 00:18:01.400 align:start position:0%
it was was 19 to zero completely
 
00:18:03.230 --> 00:18:03.240 align:start position:0%
bipartisan both Republicans and
 
00:18:05.310 --> 00:18:05.320 align:start position:0%
Democrats agreeing this was a fair
 
00:18:07.430 --> 00:18:07.440 align:start position:0%
estimate okay with that introduction let
 
00:18:09.710 --> 00:18:09.720 align:start position:0%
me go to the to the green sheet that you
 
00:18:12.029 --> 00:18:12.039 align:start position:0%
all have in front of you and quickly uh
 
00:18:14.310 --> 00:18:14.320 align:start position:0%
not to spend much more time on this
 
00:18:15.430 --> 00:18:15.440 align:start position:0%
because I know we have a lot of business
 
00:18:17.470 --> 00:18:17.480 align:start position:0%
to get to but if we look at the uh line
 
00:18:21.110 --> 00:18:21.120 align:start position:0%
12 business taxes uh business taxes we
 
00:18:22.549 --> 00:18:22.559 align:start position:0%
have I think many of you probably
 
00:18:26.950 --> 00:18:26.960 align:start position:0%
already know uh collections are down so
 
00:18:28.430 --> 00:18:28.440 align:start position:0%
the that's why you'll see the official
 
00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:29.590 align:start position:0%
the that's why you'll see the official
estim

00:18:29.590 --> 00:18:29.600 align:start position:0%
estim
 
00:18:33.430 --> 00:18:33.440 align:start position:0%
from before of 1.25 n million is higher
 
00:18:35.710 --> 00:18:35.720 align:start position:0%
than the committee estimate for the rest
 
00:18:39.310 --> 00:18:39.320 align:start position:0%
of 2025 we did see growth uh we did plan
 
00:18:41.909 --> 00:18:41.919 align:start position:0%
on growth of 3 to 4% over the next two
 
00:18:44.590 --> 00:18:44.600 align:start position:0%
years that that being fiscal year 26 and
 
00:18:48.350 --> 00:18:48.360 align:start position:0%
and then another 3 or 4% fiscal year 27
 
00:18:50.029 --> 00:18:50.039 align:start position:0%
and thus that's why if you look at the
 
00:18:53.990 --> 00:18:54.000 align:start position:0%
rightand most uh roow there it's
 
00:18:56.230 --> 00:18:56.240 align:start position:0%
1.102 uh actually billion I don't know
 
00:18:59.110 --> 00:18:59.120 align:start position:0%
if I said million before um rooms and
 
00:19:00.990 --> 00:19:01.000 align:start position:0%
meals are doing pretty good those are
 
00:19:02.990 --> 00:19:03.000 align:start position:0%
those uh have have stood the test of
 
00:19:04.549 --> 00:19:04.559 align:start position:0%
time pretty well that's why you see
 
00:19:07.909 --> 00:19:07.919 align:start position:0%
those going up uh the tobacco tax we've
 
00:19:11.110 --> 00:19:11.120 align:start position:0%
seen some degradation there primarily
 
00:19:13.390 --> 00:19:13.400 align:start position:0%
because less people are smoking and more
 
00:19:14.750 --> 00:19:14.760 align:start position:0%
people are starting to go towards
 
00:19:19.029 --> 00:19:19.039 align:start position:0%
ecigarettes uh Vapors and and and the
 
00:19:21.950 --> 00:19:21.960 align:start position:0%
liquids that uh go in them the taxes on
 
00:19:23.950 --> 00:19:23.960 align:start position:0%
those aren't as high but the committee
 
00:19:27.070 --> 00:19:27.080 align:start position:0%
also heard testimony that there may be
 
00:19:29.149 --> 00:19:29.159 align:start position:0%
several establishments that that are not
 
00:19:32.430 --> 00:19:32.440 align:start position:0%
paying their taxes uh on on those e
 
00:19:35.190 --> 00:19:35.200 align:start position:0%
ecigarette things so um we need to look
 
00:19:36.909 --> 00:19:36.919 align:start position:0%
at that further but for now tobacco
 
00:19:38.909 --> 00:19:38.919 align:start position:0%
revenue is down mainly because uh
 
00:19:41.430 --> 00:19:41.440 align:start position:0%
regular cigarette smoking is down liquor
 
00:19:45.310 --> 00:19:45.320 align:start position:0%
sales also um are down and some of that
 
00:19:47.390 --> 00:19:47.400 align:start position:0%
uh could be due to the same sort of
 
00:19:50.390 --> 00:19:50.400 align:start position:0%
thing where ecigarettes and Vapes are
 
00:19:52.029 --> 00:19:52.039 align:start position:0%
taking some of that so we need a we're
 
00:19:53.590 --> 00:19:53.600 align:start position:0%
going to have to take a closer look at
 
00:19:55.230 --> 00:19:55.240 align:start position:0%
where that's heading interest in
 
00:19:58.070 --> 00:19:58.080 align:start position:0%
dividends tax you all should know um by
 
00:19:59.549 --> 00:19:59.559 align:start position:0%
now that that's going away that's why
 
00:20:02.390 --> 00:20:02.400 align:start position:0%
when you look at column 16 you see the
 
00:20:04.909 --> 00:20:04.919 align:start position:0%
that going down and then ultimately zero
 
00:20:06.470 --> 00:20:06.480 align:start position:0%
uh in
 
00:20:09.669 --> 00:20:09.679 align:start position:0%
2027 um and then you've got uh things
 
00:20:12.549 --> 00:20:12.559 align:start position:0%
like insurance tax Communications uh
 
00:20:15.390 --> 00:20:15.400 align:start position:0%
Services tax that are pretty stable
 
00:20:17.710 --> 00:20:17.720 align:start position:0%
those don't vary much from year to year
 
00:20:20.630 --> 00:20:20.640 align:start position:0%
uh the real estate transfer tax uh
 
00:20:22.669 --> 00:20:22.679 align:start position:0%
obviously just a lack of in inventory
 
00:20:26.110 --> 00:20:26.120 align:start position:0%
has caused real estate uh sales uh to
 
00:20:28.350 --> 00:20:28.360 align:start position:0%
diminish but prices are higher the net
 
00:20:29.669 --> 00:20:29.679 align:start position:0%
effect is we've seen a little
 
00:20:31.149 --> 00:20:31.159 align:start position:0%
degradation but we're also starting to
 
00:20:33.430 --> 00:20:33.440 align:start position:0%
see an uptick in real estate purchase
 
00:20:34.789 --> 00:20:34.799 align:start position:0%
again so that's why you'll see those
 
00:20:38.190 --> 00:20:38.200 align:start position:0%
numbers going up in 26 and 27 and then
 
00:20:40.390 --> 00:20:40.400 align:start position:0%
things like court fines and fees on line
 
00:20:43.990 --> 00:20:44.000 align:start position:0%
20 uh line 21 Securities revenues beer
 
00:20:46.230 --> 00:20:46.240 align:start position:0%
tax 22 all those are very stable don't
 
00:20:50.310 --> 00:20:50.320 align:start position:0%
vary a whole lot um line 23 other that's
 
00:20:52.669 --> 00:20:52.679 align:start position:0%
uh typically interest on on cash
 
00:20:54.430 --> 00:20:54.440 align:start position:0%
Holdings there was a lot of money from
 
00:20:57.789 --> 00:20:57.799 align:start position:0%
covid that was earning interest um and
 
00:20:59.549 --> 00:20:59.559 align:start position:0%
that's as that slowly goes away you see
 
00:21:03.830 --> 00:21:03.840 align:start position:0%
a decrease there and then um as you look
 
00:21:06.430 --> 00:21:06.440 align:start position:0%
through the through the rest of the um
 
00:21:09.350 --> 00:21:09.360 align:start position:0%
Lottery uh Lottery is down a little bit
 
00:21:12.750 --> 00:21:12.760 align:start position:0%
but we expect that to stay fairly stable
 
00:21:14.830 --> 00:21:14.840 align:start position:0%
uh tobacco settlement is basically
 
00:21:17.950 --> 00:21:17.960 align:start position:0%
there's a tobacco settlement that uh
 
00:21:19.669 --> 00:21:19.679 align:start position:0%
over the next we're still another 10
 
00:21:21.830 --> 00:21:21.840 align:start position:0%
years or so where we'll be collecting
 
00:21:24.350 --> 00:21:24.360 align:start position:0%
that that's that's fairly stable line 26
 
00:21:27.669 --> 00:21:27.679 align:start position:0%
utility property tax uh pretty uh that
 
00:21:29.789 --> 00:21:29.799 align:start position:0%
is pretty stable Statewide property tax
 
00:21:31.430 --> 00:21:31.440 align:start position:0%
the rest of the sheet going on down is
 
00:21:33.630 --> 00:21:33.640 align:start position:0%
fairly stable not a whole lot of change
 
00:21:36.830 --> 00:21:36.840 align:start position:0%
so um this is uh the committee did their
 
00:21:39.750 --> 00:21:39.760 align:start position:0%
best uh estimates uh we spent a lot of
 
00:21:41.669 --> 00:21:41.679 align:start position:0%
time trying to come to the reality of
 
00:21:43.950 --> 00:21:43.960 align:start position:0%
what it really is and that's why I think
 
00:21:45.590 --> 00:21:45.600 align:start position:0%
it was unanimous vote and this is where
 
00:21:48.590 --> 00:21:48.600 align:start position:0%
we ended up I ask for your uh press the
 
00:21:50.630 --> 00:21:50.640 align:start position:0%
green button to pass this
 
00:21:56.630 --> 00:21:56.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:59.110 --> 00:21:59.120 align:start position:0%
you the the question is on the motion to
 
00:21:59.120 --> 00:22:01.230 align:start position:0%
you the the question is on the motion to
Auto

00:22:01.230 --> 00:22:01.240 align:start position:0%
Auto
 
00:22:04.269 --> 00:22:04.279 align:start position:0%
pass are you ready for the question all
 
00:22:08.029 --> 00:22:08.039 align:start position:0%
those in favor say i i n the eyes have
 
00:22:10.830 --> 00:22:10.840 align:start position:0%

of towns cities and our neighbors in our
 
00:27:23.750 --> 00:27:23.760 align:start position:0%

Speaker the the amendment um is is a
 
00:33:55.509 --> 00:33:55.519 align:start position:0%
bipartisan from the committee it just
 
00:33:58.430 --> 00:33:58.440 align:start position:0%
cleans up a couple questions on this
 
00:34:01.389 --> 00:34:01.399 align:start position:0%
it makes it so that um when a no
 
00:34:03.789 --> 00:34:03.799 align:start position:0%

00:34:06.710 --> 00:34:06.720 align:start position:0%

the next meeting scheduled to address an
 
00:34:13.349 --> 00:34:13.359 align:start position:0%
appeal of that and it also makes it so a

super majority is not needed to consider
 
00:34:17.990 --> 00:34:18.000 align:start position:0%
the not trest just a simple majority and
 
00:34:19.510 --> 00:34:19.520 align:start position:0%

00:34:24.270 --> 00:34:24.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:27.710 --> 00:34:27.720 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr Speaker uh I'll be brief I
 
00:38:34.069 --> 00:38:34.079 align:start position:0%
speak as much as a uh a police
 
00:38:36.069 --> 00:38:36.079 align:start position:0%
commissioner uh in Port smouth as I do
 
00:38:38.230 --> 00:38:38.240 align:start position:0%
as a representative those of you who've
 
00:38:42.710 --> 00:38:42.720 align:start position:0%
been police officers know that uh
 
00:38:45.670 --> 00:38:45.680 align:start position:0%
speeding is the largest number of
 
00:38:48.270 --> 00:38:48.280 align:start position:0%
complaints to any Police Department in
 
00:38:51.829 --> 00:38:51.839 align:start position:0%
the State uh particularly speeding in
 
00:38:53.950 --> 00:38:53.960 align:start position:0%
residential areas one of the most
 
00:38:56.589 --> 00:38:56.599 align:start position:0%
valuable things at starting to reduce
 
00:38:59.390 --> 00:38:59.400 align:start position:0%
that if not ever getting rid of it is
 
00:39:02.790 --> 00:39:02.800 align:start position:0%
those digital signs that say slow down
 
00:39:06.950 --> 00:39:06.960 align:start position:0%
or you're going 45 in a 30 um and
 
00:39:09.829 --> 00:39:09.839 align:start position:0%
there's a a variety of equipment uh that
 
00:39:12.829 --> 00:39:12.839 align:start position:0%
helps moderate the the excess of
 
00:39:16.510 --> 00:39:16.520 align:start position:0%
speeding that's going on um you it's the
 
00:39:19.069 --> 00:39:19.079 align:start position:0%
department of safety is not in fact
 
00:39:21.230 --> 00:39:21.240 align:start position:0%
allocating a lot of funds to do that
 
00:39:25.349 --> 00:39:25.359 align:start position:0%
even though they could uh and to uh to
 
00:39:28.829 --> 00:39:28.839 align:start position:0%
pass this bill it would not in it would
 
00:39:32.069 --> 00:39:32.079 align:start position:0%
not require a lot of bureaucracy so I
 
00:39:34.990 --> 00:39:35.000 align:start position:0%
urge uh everyone to press the red button
 
00:39:37.510 --> 00:39:37.520 align:start position:0%
and vote
 
00:39:40.150 --> 00:39:40.160 align:start position:0%
no representative Rose is recognized to
 
00:39:42.430 --> 00:39:42.440 align:start position:0%

00:39:45.510 --> 00:39:45.520 align:start position:0%
report thank you Mr
 
00:39:47.430 --> 00:39:47.440 align:start position:0%
Speaker colleagues you know what else
 
00:39:50.829 --> 00:39:50.839 align:start position:0%
will help alleviate speeding your right
 
00:39:53.390 --> 00:39:53.400 align:start position:0%
foot and looking at your
 
00:39:57.430 --> 00:39:57.440 align:start position:0%
speedometer that works I guarantee it
 
00:39:58.990 --> 00:39:59.000 align:start position:0%
now one thing that I will tell you is I
 
00:40:00.990 --> 00:40:01.000 align:start position:0%
am not an expert in New Hampshire
 
00:40:03.030 --> 00:40:03.040 align:start position:0%
history but fortunately for me I know
 
00:40:06.950 --> 00:40:06.960 align:start position:0%
who to call I have a colleague that is a
 
00:40:09.670 --> 00:40:09.680 align:start position:0%
selectman and I'm fortunate enough to uh
 
00:40:11.470 --> 00:40:11.480 align:start position:0%
share a town with him two towns that I
 
00:40:13.510 --> 00:40:13.520 align:start position:0%
represent he's my own little personal
 
00:40:16.109 --> 00:40:16.119 align:start position:0%
Cliff claven so I called him and I said
 
00:40:19.550 --> 00:40:19.560 align:start position:0%
hey I have a question if a town needs to
 
00:40:20.710 --> 00:40:20.720 align:start position:0%
get some
 
00:40:22.829 --> 00:40:22.839 align:start position:0%
money are they able to go to the state
 
00:40:24.990 --> 00:40:25.000 align:start position:0%
or are the grants for highway equipment
 
00:40:27.030 --> 00:40:27.040 align:start position:0%
you know slow down little blinking signs
 
00:40:29.430 --> 00:40:29.440 align:start position:0%
and he's said nope there's not but let
 
00:40:30.870 --> 00:40:30.880 align:start position:0%
me tell you why there's
 
00:40:34.069 --> 00:40:34.079 align:start position:0%
not apparently about 30 years ago don't
 
00:40:36.309 --> 00:40:36.319 align:start position:0%
quote me on that cuz I am not Cliff
 
00:40:39.030 --> 00:40:39.040 align:start position:0%
claven we still had some justice of the
 
00:40:42.829 --> 00:40:42.839 align:start position:0%
peace magistrates in the state and their
 
00:40:46.950 --> 00:40:46.960 align:start position:0%
job whenever money came in from a ticket
 
00:40:49.430 --> 00:40:49.440 align:start position:0%
was to decide how much that money was
 
00:40:52.109 --> 00:40:52.119 align:start position:0%
and it stayed in that town and they said
 
00:40:53.950 --> 00:40:53.960 align:start position:0%
oh look this is a little bit of conflict
 
00:40:54.990 --> 00:40:55.000 align:start position:0%
ADV interest interest it's called
 
00:40:58.470 --> 00:40:58.480 align:start position:0%
policing for profit
 
00:41:02.630 --> 00:41:02.640 align:start position:0%
so if we adopt this we're going back to
 
00:41:06.990 --> 00:41:07.000 align:start position:0%
incentivize to give tickets to buy stuff
 
00:41:09.950 --> 00:41:09.960 align:start position:0%
the police do sit alongside the roads
 
00:41:11.630 --> 00:41:11.640 align:start position:0%
and they do give tickets because I can
 
00:41:14.790 --> 00:41:14.800 align:start position:0%
assure you I talk to them
 
00:41:18.670 --> 00:41:18.680 align:start position:0%
often so let's not go
 
00:41:20.910 --> 00:41:20.920 align:start position:0%
backwards the system is working just
 
00:41:25.910 --> 00:41:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:28.109 --> 00:41:28.119 align:start position:0%

00:45:23.150 --> 00:45:23.160 align:start position:0%
report thank you Mr
 
00:45:25.630 --> 00:45:25.640 align:start position:0%
Speaker this bill requires the Attorney
 
00:45:27.630 --> 00:45:27.640 align:start position:0%
General to formally request that federal
 
00:45:30.670 --> 00:45:30.680 align:start position:0%
government agencies with law enforcement
 
00:45:32.950 --> 00:45:32.960 align:start position:0%
investigatory or operational activities
 
00:45:35.750 --> 00:45:35.760 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire
 
00:45:39.230 --> 00:45:39.240 align:start position:0%
voluntarily provide aggregated an an
 
00:45:39.240 --> 00:45:41.190 align:start position:0%
voluntarily provide aggregated an an
anim

00:45:41.190 --> 00:45:41.200 align:start position:0%
anim
 
00:45:43.829 --> 00:45:43.839 align:start position:0%
anatomized data
 
00:45:46.390 --> 00:45:46.400 align:start position:0%
quarterly according to testimony these
 
00:45:48.470 --> 00:45:48.480 align:start position:0%
requests would require federal agencies
 
00:45:50.390 --> 00:45:50.400 align:start position:0%
to report
 
00:45:53.109 --> 00:45:53.119 align:start position:0%
voluntarily 10 data points like the
 
00:45:54.950 --> 00:45:54.960 align:start position:0%
number of facilities and staff in the
 
00:45:57.790 --> 00:45:57.800 align:start position:0%
state warrants serve
 
00:46:00.470 --> 00:46:00.480 align:start position:0%
and arrest and deportations
 
00:46:02.910 --> 00:46:02.920 align:start position:0%
accomplished producing this data will be
 
00:46:05.589 --> 00:46:05.599 align:start position:0%
very work intensive and costly a costly
 
00:46:07.190 --> 00:46:07.200 align:start position:0%
task for those
 
00:46:10.270 --> 00:46:10.280 align:start position:0%
agencies it will also be costly to New
 
00:46:12.750 --> 00:46:12.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the fiscal note says that the
 
00:46:15.109 --> 00:46:15.119 align:start position:0%
bill will require three new staff
 
00:46:18.630 --> 00:46:18.640 align:start position:0%
members at a cost of over $200,000 in
 
00:46:22.109 --> 00:46:22.119 align:start position:0%
the first year and in future years and a
 
00:46:24.349 --> 00:46:24.359 align:start position:0%
new website will be required to report
 
00:46:27.190 --> 00:46:27.200 align:start position:0%
these results
 
00:46:29.030 --> 00:46:29.040 align:start position:0%
since the provision of the information
 
00:46:31.390 --> 00:46:31.400 align:start position:0%
is strictly voluntary cooperations by
 
00:46:36.069 --> 00:46:36.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:38.470 --> 00:46:38.480 align:start position:0%
questionable due to the downsizing of
 
00:46:40.510 --> 00:46:40.520 align:start position:0%
federal agencies and the fact that some
 
00:46:42.349 --> 00:46:42.359 align:start position:0%
of the data may not be collected or
 
00:46:43.710 --> 00:46:43.720 align:start position:0%
reported by these
 
00:46:46.190 --> 00:46:46.200 align:start position:0%
agency if this bill were to become law
 
00:46:47.750 --> 00:46:47.760 align:start position:0%
and the federal agencies do not
 
00:46:49.349 --> 00:46:49.359 align:start position:0%
cooperate the Attorney General will
 
00:46:50.950 --> 00:46:50.960 align:start position:0%
still have to build and maintain a
 
00:46:54.470 --> 00:46:54.480 align:start position:0%
searchable website hire staff and
 
00:46:56.390 --> 00:46:56.400 align:start position:0%
continue to make quarterly requests and
 
00:46:56.400 --> 00:46:58.470 align:start position:0%
continue to make quarterly requests and
reports

00:46:58.470 --> 00:46:58.480 align:start position:0%
reports
 
00:47:00.349 --> 00:47:00.359 align:start position:0%
and just an indication of some of the
 
00:47:03.589 --> 00:47:03.599 align:start position:0%
problems with being asked by this um
 
00:47:06.950 --> 00:47:06.960 align:start position:0%
Bill the federal a one of the things the
 
00:47:09.430 --> 00:47:09.440 align:start position:0%
website is required to indicate is the
 
00:47:11.990 --> 00:47:12.000 align:start position:0%
federal agencies not present or
 
00:47:14.589 --> 00:47:14.599 align:start position:0%
operational in New Hampshire now think
 
00:47:16.510 --> 00:47:16.520 align:start position:0%
about how many agencies there are that
 
00:47:17.829 --> 00:47:17.839 align:start position:0%
would be on the list that would have to
 
00:47:17.839 --> 00:47:18.710 align:start position:0%
would be on the list that would have to
be

00:47:18.710 --> 00:47:18.720 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:47:20.870 --> 00:47:20.880 align:start position:0%
updated the production of this
 
00:47:24.270 --> 00:47:24.280 align:start position:0%
information on all federal agencies
 
00:47:27.069 --> 00:47:27.079 align:start position:0%
totally absent from New Hampshire seem
 
00:47:29.270 --> 00:47:29.280 align:start position:0%
to be an almost unworkable task to
 
00:47:32.630 --> 00:47:32.640 align:start position:0%
maintain an update given the fact given
 
00:47:34.390 --> 00:47:34.400 align:start position:0%
these facts the bill should be deemed
 
00:47:36.870 --> 00:47:36.880 align:start position:0%
inexpedient to legislate until it
 
00:47:40.030 --> 00:47:40.040 align:start position:0%
becomes less costly and more
 
00:47:43.349 --> 00:47:43.359 align:start position:0%
efficient thank you Mr
 
00:47:45.710 --> 00:47:45.720 align:start position:0%
Speaker representative Roy recognized
 
00:47:46.950 --> 00:47:46.960 align:start position:0%
speak and support of the committee
 
00:47:50.430 --> 00:47:50.440 align:start position:0%
report thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker
 
00:47:53.390 --> 00:47:53.400 align:start position:0%
the committee heard the same testimony
 
00:47:55.630 --> 00:47:55.640 align:start position:0%
and we came to the conclusion that the
 
00:47:57.750 --> 00:47:57.760 align:start position:0%
citizens in Hampshire have a right to
 
00:47:59.510 --> 00:47:59.520 align:start position:0%
know what their federal government is
 
00:48:02.430 --> 00:48:02.440 align:start position:0%
doing in our state and if they refuse to
 
00:48:04.150 --> 00:48:04.160 align:start position:0%
answer then that website will say your
 
00:48:05.950 --> 00:48:05.960 align:start position:0%
federal government refus to answer and
 
00:48:07.470 --> 00:48:07.480 align:start position:0%
the citizens can take that to the
 
00:48:09.630 --> 00:48:09.640 align:start position:0%
federal government but our citizens have
 
00:48:12.030 --> 00:48:12.040 align:start position:0%
a right to know who's being arrested
 
00:48:14.430 --> 00:48:14.440 align:start position:0%
who's homes are being searched who's
 
00:48:17.109 --> 00:48:17.119 align:start position:0%
being disappeared things of that nature
 
00:48:19.829 --> 00:48:19.839 align:start position:0%
um so if you are like the rest of the
 
00:48:21.069 --> 00:48:21.079 align:start position:0%
committee would like to know what's
 
00:48:23.150 --> 00:48:23.160 align:start position:0%
going on um and you'd like our attorney
 
00:48:24.990 --> 00:48:25.000 align:start position:0%
general to ask the federal government
 
00:48:26.630 --> 00:48:26.640 align:start position:0%
what they're doing vote Yes and support
 
00:48:28.870 --> 00:48:28.880 align:start position:0%

00:48:31.069 --> 00:48:31.079 align:start position:0%

00:49:22.640 --> 00:49:26.910 align:start position:0%
 
clear

00:49:26.910 --> 00:49:26.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:28.230 --> 00:49:28.240 align:start position:0%
the questions on the majority committee
 
00:49:31.910 --> 00:49:31.920 align:start position:0%
report about to pass on House Bill
 
00:49:34.270 --> 00:49:34.280 align:start position:0%
640 representative Muse is recognized
 
00:49:39.150 --> 00:49:39.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:42.470 --> 00:49:42.480 align:start position:0%
inquiry thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker
 
00:49:44.349 --> 00:49:44.359 align:start position:0%
if I know this bill would require
 
00:49:46.789 --> 00:49:46.799 align:start position:0%
federal agencies to voluntarily provide
 
00:49:48.630 --> 00:49:48.640 align:start position:0%
data that they have no obligation to
 
00:49:50.710 --> 00:49:50.720 align:start position:0%
supply at a time when the federal
 
00:49:52.710 --> 00:49:52.720 align:start position:0%
Workforce is being challenged to be more
 
00:49:55.549 --> 00:49:55.559 align:start position:0%
efficient with fewer people and if I
 
00:49:58.030 --> 00:49:58.040 align:start position:0%
also know the fiscal says that to comply
 
00:49:59.950 --> 00:49:59.960 align:start position:0%
with this bill the Attorney General's
 
00:50:01.549 --> 00:50:01.559 align:start position:0%
office would be forced to staff three
 
00:50:04.589 --> 00:50:04.599 align:start position:0%
new positions at a cost of close to 3/4
 
00:50:06.470 --> 00:50:06.480 align:start position:0%
of a million dollars over the next three
 
00:50:08.750 --> 00:50:08.760 align:start position:0%
years when we have our own budget and
 
00:50:08.760 --> 00:50:09.829 align:start position:0%
years when we have our own budget and
efficiency

00:50:09.829 --> 00:50:09.839 align:start position:0%
efficiency
 
00:50:12.829 --> 00:50:12.839 align:start position:0%
challenges and finally Mr Speaker if I
 
00:50:14.309 --> 00:50:14.319 align:start position:0%
know that there are ways to improve
 
00:50:16.470 --> 00:50:16.480 align:start position:0%
transparency that may not involve making
 
00:50:18.789 --> 00:50:18.799 align:start position:0%
a large investment to post hard to
 
00:50:21.309 --> 00:50:21.319 align:start position:0%
collect information on a website that
 
00:50:22.950 --> 00:50:22.960 align:start position:0%
where most people can never find what
 
00:50:25.309 --> 00:50:25.319 align:start position:0%
they're looking for anyway then would I
 
00:50:27.630 --> 00:50:27.640 align:start position:0%
press the red button to defeat this
 
00:50:29.950 --> 00:50:29.960 align:start position:0%
motion so another motion may be made
 
00:50:29.960 --> 00:50:30.870 align:start position:0%
motion so another motion may be made
thank

00:50:30.870 --> 00:50:30.880 align:start position:0%

you representative Roy recognized for
parliamentary

00:50:35.270 --> 00:50:35.280 align:start position:0%
parliamentary
 
00:50:37.990 --> 00:50:38.000 align:start position:0%
inquiry Mr Speaker if I know that when
 
00:50:40.069 --> 00:50:40.079 align:start position:0%
you ask someone to do a job and they
 
00:50:41.549 --> 00:50:41.559 align:start position:0%
don't really want to do it they tell you
 
00:50:42.910 --> 00:50:42.920 align:start position:0%
it's going to cost a lot more than it
 
00:50:44.190 --> 00:50:44.200 align:start position:0%
really does because they don't want you
 
00:50:48.069 --> 00:50:48.079 align:start position:0%
to take the job and if I know that and
 
00:50:51.150 --> 00:50:51.160 align:start position:0%
if I know that this will not cost what

much Mr Speaker if I know just eight
 
00:58:49.789 --> 00:58:49.799 align:start position:0%
months ago HB 354 was signed in the law
 
00:58:52.349 --> 00:58:52.359 align:start position:0%
authorizing building Aid eligibility for
 
00:58:55.309 --> 00:58:55.319 align:start position:0%
Charter Public Schools that comply with
 
00:58:56.910 --> 00:58:56.920 align:start position:0%
building standards
 
00:58:59.349 --> 00:58:59.359 align:start position:0%
have state approved asset disposition

renovation and construction requirements
 
00:59:06.549 --> 00:59:06.559 align:start position:0%
in law and if I further believe this
 
00:59:08.589 --> 00:59:08.599 align:start position:0%
attempt to undo Charter Public School
 
00:59:11.670 --> 00:59:11.680 align:start position:0%
eligibility for building Aid support is
 
00:59:15.510 --> 00:59:15.520 align:start position:0%
short cited and compromises the safety
 
00:59:18.230 --> 00:59:18.240 align:start position:0%
security and well-being of New Hampshire
 
00:59:20.990 --> 00:59:21.000 align:start position:0%

00:59:27.109 --> 00:59:27.119 align:start position:0%
is no ration
 
00:59:30.430 --> 00:59:30.440 align:start position:0%
reason to deny or discriminate against
 
00:59:32.950 --> 00:59:32.960 align:start position:0%

if I know that HB 583 is less about
 
01:03:24.789 --> 01:03:24.799 align:start position:0%
feeding kids at school than it is about
 
01:03:27.589 --> 01:03:27.599 align:start position:0%
hopes to boost adequacy funding and

that our developing budget can't

legislation finally Mr Speaker if I know
 
01:03:46.309 --> 01:03:46.319 align:start position:0%
that the role of deciding whether to
 
01:03:48.230 --> 01:03:48.240 align:start position:0%
register a child for the free and
 
01:03:51.230 --> 01:03:51.240 align:start position:0%

01:03:53.630 --> 01:03:53.640 align:start position:0%
parents who may have their own reasons
 
01:03:56.750 --> 01:03:56.760 align:start position:0%

committee amendment that is waiting to
 
01:04:13.789 --> 01:04:13.799 align:start position:0%
be heard if we can overturn the itl
 
01:04:16.950 --> 01:04:16.960 align:start position:0%
motion on this legislation and if I know
 
01:04:18.829 --> 01:04:18.839 align:start position:0%
that the tabling motion on this
 
01:04:20.990 --> 01:04:21.000 align:start position:0%
legislation would result in kids not
 
01:04:23.950 --> 01:04:23.960 align:start position:0%
being fed despite what the members said
 
01:04:26.750 --> 01:04:26.760 align:start position:0%
then would I now vote against the motion
 
01:04:28.870 --> 01:04:28.880 align:start position:0%
to table so that at the very least we
 
01:04:31.430 --> 01:04:31.440 align:start position:0%

amendment that is before us thank you Mr

on the highered institutions that they

extensive background as a high school
 
01:11:52.510 --> 01:11:52.520 align:start position:0%
educator and District administrator the
 
01:11:54.629 --> 01:11:54.639 align:start position:0%
importance of a high school student

the State of New

will help the public colleges and
 
01:12:14.149 --> 01:12:14.159 align:start position:0%
universities in New Hampshire by
 
01:12:16.390 --> 01:12:16.400 align:start position:0%
increasing enrollment filling them with
 
01:12:19.350 --> 01:12:19.360 align:start position:0%
highly qualified candidates what I now
 
01:12:21.510 --> 01:12:21.520 align:start position:0%
press the red button so a better motion
 
01:12:27.990 --> 01:12:28.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:29.910 --> 01:12:29.920 align:start position:0%

inquiry thank you Mr
 
01:12:39.950 --> 01:12:39.960 align:start position:0%
Speaker Mr Speaker if I concede that
 
01:12:41.790 --> 01:12:41.800 align:start position:0%
encouraging more students to perform
 
01:12:44.669 --> 01:12:44.679 align:start position:0%
community service projects would be good
 
01:12:48.189 --> 01:12:48.199 align:start position:0%
and various ways of doing so exist but I
 
01:12:50.390 --> 01:12:50.400 align:start position:0%
would rather ask them to volunteer than
 
01:12:53.590 --> 01:12:53.600 align:start position:0%
to trade College tuition credits as an
 
01:12:55.990 --> 01:12:56.000 align:start position:0%
inducement and if I have no way to know
 
01:12:58.430 --> 01:12:58.440 align:start position:0%
that the what the net revenue effect uh
 
01:13:00.830 --> 01:13:00.840 align:start position:0%
will be of the bill on the University
 
01:13:03.590 --> 01:13:03.600 align:start position:0%
and Community College systems and
 
01:13:05.310 --> 01:13:05.320 align:start position:0%
further if I know that the Department of
 
01:13:08.229 --> 01:13:08.239 align:start position:0%
Education would require several new
 
01:13:10.590 --> 01:13:10.600 align:start position:0%

organizations sites and activities and
 
01:13:17.110 --> 01:13:17.120 align:start position:0%
further create a system to track and
 
01:13:20.790 --> 01:13:20.800 align:start position:0%
approve the activities of up to 12,500
 
01:13:23.629 --> 01:13:23.639 align:start position:0%
High School seniors not to mention
 
01:13:25.750 --> 01:13:25.760 align:start position:0%

01:13:28.350 --> 01:13:28.360 align:start position:0%

same with the recommendation that the

considered the same and being unable to

agree with the majority Report with the
 
01:15:17.430 --> 01:15:17.440 align:start position:0%

01:15:34.070 --> 01:15:34.080 align:start position:0%
report thank you Mr
 
01:15:37.350 --> 01:15:37.360 align:start position:0%
Speaker an open enrollment school is any
 
01:15:39.430 --> 01:15:39.440 align:start position:0%
public school which accepts students
 
01:15:42.070 --> 01:15:42.080 align:start position:0%
from other Public Schools outside the
 
01:15:45.790 --> 01:15:45.800 align:start position:0%
district HB 771 would change how funding
 
01:15:48.830 --> 01:15:48.840 align:start position:0%
for open enrollment schools is sent and
 
01:15:51.629 --> 01:15:51.639 align:start position:0%
received it would require all public
 
01:15:54.430 --> 01:15:54.440 align:start position:0%
school districts to establish a line
 
01:15:56.750 --> 01:15:56.760 align:start position:0%
item in their operating budgets
 
01:15:58.550 --> 01:15:58.560 align:start position:0%
reflecting expenditures for open
 
01:16:01.030 --> 01:16:01.040 align:start position:0%
enrollment to send students to those
 
01:16:04.229 --> 01:16:04.239 align:start position:0%
Public Schools outside their District HB
 
01:16:07.550 --> 01:16:07.560 align:start position:0%
771 essentially mandates every school to
 
01:16:10.950 --> 01:16:10.960 align:start position:0%
become a sending School the tuition
 
01:16:13.270 --> 01:16:13.280 align:start position:0%
would be set at 80% of the average per
 
01:16:16.910 --> 01:16:16.920 align:start position:0%
pupil cost for the sending students home
 
01:16:19.310 --> 01:16:19.320 align:start position:0%
District the taxpayers of the Open
 
01:16:21.790 --> 01:16:21.800 align:start position:0%
Enrollment receiving school and their
 
01:16:24.110 --> 01:16:24.120 align:start position:0%
taxpayers would fund the difference
 
01:16:26.030 --> 01:16:26.040 align:start position:0%
there is no statement in the bill
 
01:16:29.070 --> 01:16:29.080 align:start position:0%
qualifying how many students a sending
 
01:16:30.870 --> 01:16:30.880 align:start position:0%
District would be obligated to pay
 
01:16:30.880 --> 01:16:31.990 align:start position:0%
District would be obligated to pay
tuition

01:16:31.990 --> 01:16:32.000 align:start position:0%
tuition
 
01:16:35.270 --> 01:16:35.280 align:start position:0%
for this bill requires local taxpayers
 
01:16:37.669 --> 01:16:37.679 align:start position:0%
to subsidize students attending schools
 
01:16:40.590 --> 01:16:40.600 align:start position:0%
in other districts a considerable risk
 
01:16:43.270 --> 01:16:43.280 align:start position:0%
of mandating open enrollment schools is
 
01:16:45.750 --> 01:16:45.760 align:start position:0%
a general decrease in the adequacy of
 
01:16:49.149 --> 01:16:49.159 align:start position:0%
education for many students because of
 
01:16:53.149 --> 01:16:53.159 align:start position:0%
our chronic systemic funding disparities
 
01:16:55.550 --> 01:16:55.560 align:start position:0%
if as a state we fund funded public
 
01:16:58.189 --> 01:16:58.199 align:start position:0%
education fairly there would probably be
 
01:17:00.030 --> 01:17:00.040 align:start position:0%
little demand for open
 
01:17:02.910 --> 01:17:02.920 align:start position:0%
enrollment for open enrollment to reduce
 
01:17:04.990 --> 01:17:05.000 align:start position:0%
operating costs for the sending district
 
01:17:07.070 --> 01:17:07.080 align:start position:0%
there would need to be a mass Exodus of
 
01:17:09.629 --> 01:17:09.639 align:start position:0%
students from that District this is
 
01:17:11.950 --> 01:17:11.960 align:start position:0%
unlikely so the overall costs of the
 
01:17:14.310 --> 01:17:14.320 align:start position:0%
sending district will increase as the
 
01:17:16.790 --> 01:17:16.800 align:start position:0%
cost of tuition students is added to the
 
01:17:19.830 --> 01:17:19.840 align:start position:0%
existing operating costs do you hear the
 
01:17:22.510 --> 01:17:22.520 align:start position:0%
chingching of increasing property taxes
 
01:17:22.520 --> 01:17:23.229 align:start position:0%
chingching of increasing property taxes
I

01:17:23.229 --> 01:17:23.239 align:start position:0%
I
 
01:17:26.149 --> 01:17:26.159 align:start position:0%
do receiving District who are not fully
 
01:17:28.390 --> 01:17:28.400 align:start position:0%
enrolled and can accommodate tuition
 
01:17:31.430 --> 01:17:31.440 align:start position:0%
students which are many can only benefit
 
01:17:33.030 --> 01:17:33.040 align:start position:0%
financially from receiving more
 
01:17:34.910 --> 01:17:34.920 align:start position:0%
districts while the sending District
 
01:17:34.920 --> 01:17:36.030 align:start position:0%
districts while the sending District
suffers

01:17:36.030 --> 01:17:36.040 align:start position:0%
suffers
 
01:17:38.350 --> 01:17:38.360 align:start position:0%
financially those receiving districts
 
01:17:40.590 --> 01:17:40.600 align:start position:0%
can choose whether to enroll additional
 
01:17:43.669 --> 01:17:43.679 align:start position:0%
students and which to enroll so this
 
01:17:45.790 --> 01:17:45.800 align:start position:0%
bill gives them all the control and all
 
01:17:45.800 --> 01:17:46.629 align:start position:0%
bill gives them all the control and all
the

01:17:46.629 --> 01:17:46.639 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:17:49.510 --> 01:17:49.520 align:start position:0%
funds given the lack of Equitable school
 
01:17:52.189 --> 01:17:52.199 align:start position:0%
funding across the state the minority
 
01:17:54.910 --> 01:17:54.920 align:start position:0%
believes that house bill 771 will only
 
01:17:57.149 --> 01:17:57.159 align:start position:0%
increase the strain on property
 
01:17:59.709 --> 01:17:59.719 align:start position:0%
taxpayers widen the disparities between
 
01:18:01.750 --> 01:18:01.760 align:start position:0%
communities and create further
 
01:18:04.350 --> 01:18:04.360 align:start position:0%
opportunity gaps now between neighboring
 
01:18:07.390 --> 01:18:07.400 align:start position:0%
school districts further before any
 
01:18:09.470 --> 01:18:09.480 align:start position:0%
change to open enrollment statutes are
 
01:18:12.189 --> 01:18:12.199 align:start position:0%
considered we should wait for the ruling
 
01:18:14.189 --> 01:18:14.199 align:start position:0%
on a Case currently filed in the New
 
01:18:16.709 --> 01:18:16.719 align:start position:0%

01:18:19.229 --> 01:18:19.239 align:start position:0%

have as far as open enrollment schools
 
01:18:39.910 --> 01:18:39.920 align:start position:0%
in the state at presently this law went
 
01:18:42.430 --> 01:18:42.440 align:start position:0%
in effect back in
 
01:18:45.189 --> 01:18:45.199 align:start position:0%
2009 and I haven't seen a mass Exodus
 
01:18:48.189 --> 01:18:48.199 align:start position:0%
from anybody regarding it what we have
 
01:18:50.590 --> 01:18:50.600 align:start position:0%
here is we have a system where we can
 
01:18:52.790 --> 01:18:52.800 align:start position:0%
have open enrollment within the school
 
01:18:54.990 --> 01:18:55.000 align:start position:0%
district where one person goes from one
 
01:18:57.110 --> 01:18:57.120 align:start position:0%
high school to another student a school
 
01:18:59.470 --> 01:18:59.480 align:start position:0%
in the that District or we can have
 
01:19:02.070 --> 01:19:02.080 align:start position:0%
students in another District outside the
 
01:19:04.070 --> 01:19:04.080 align:start position:0%
residential district having their
 
01:19:07.950 --> 01:19:07.960 align:start position:0%
students tuition to the open enrollment
 
01:19:10.070 --> 01:19:10.080 align:start position:0%
District how these open enrollment
 
01:19:12.189 --> 01:19:12.199 align:start position:0%
schools accept students is based upon
 
01:19:14.430 --> 01:19:14.440 align:start position:0%
the local board making that decision on
 
01:19:16.669 --> 01:19:16.679 align:start position:0%
the number of spots they have vacancies
 
01:19:19.430 --> 01:19:19.440 align:start position:0%
they have open in their schools and it's
 
01:19:21.750 --> 01:19:21.760 align:start position:0%
based upon aptitude achievement of the
 
01:19:23.950 --> 01:19:23.960 align:start position:0%
student and other needs so it's just
 
01:19:25.990 --> 01:19:26.000 align:start position:0%
clearly an open open enrollment we have
 
01:19:28.310 --> 01:19:28.320 align:start position:0%
five extra chairs in this particular
 
01:19:31.430 --> 01:19:31.440 align:start position:0%
program we have five open spots what
 
01:19:33.270 --> 01:19:33.280 align:start position:0%
happens if there's more people applying
 
01:19:34.830 --> 01:19:34.840 align:start position:0%
for those spots from out a district
 
01:19:36.149 --> 01:19:36.159 align:start position:0%
while it's like the charter schools
 
01:19:39.149 --> 01:19:39.159 align:start position:0%
where there's a lottery held this is all
 
01:19:42.430 --> 01:19:42.440 align:start position:0%
in current law now why do we have this
 
01:19:44.910 --> 01:19:44.920 align:start position:0%
bill coming forward here the
 
01:19:47.669 --> 01:19:47.679 align:start position:0%
771 it
 
01:19:50.390 --> 01:19:50.400 align:start position:0%
clarifies open enrollment the Open
 
01:19:53.709 --> 01:19:53.719 align:start position:0%
Enrollment school is the receiving
 
01:19:53.719 --> 01:19:55.189 align:start position:0%
Enrollment school is the receiving
School

01:19:55.189 --> 01:19:55.199 align:start position:0%
School
 
01:19:58.070 --> 01:19:58.080 align:start position:0%
not the sending School the sending
 
01:20:00.910 --> 01:20:00.920 align:start position:0%
school does not have to have a local
 
01:20:03.030 --> 01:20:03.040 align:start position:0%
legislative decision by their school
 
01:20:05.750 --> 01:20:05.760 align:start position:0%
board or the town to decide we're an
 
01:20:07.870 --> 01:20:07.880 align:start position:0%
open enrollment school because the kids
 
01:20:09.910 --> 01:20:09.920 align:start position:0%
are going from the residential district
 
01:20:12.990 --> 01:20:13.000 align:start position:0%
to the open enrollment School in the
 
01:20:15.229 --> 01:20:15.239 align:start position:0%
other District or even between schools
 
01:20:17.030 --> 01:20:17.040 align:start position:0%
within the district I experienced that
 
01:20:19.189 --> 01:20:19.199 align:start position:0%
when I was up in Anchorage we had kids
 
01:20:21.149 --> 01:20:21.159 align:start position:0%
going from West High to East High I'm
 
01:20:22.590 --> 01:20:22.600 align:start position:0%
sure you have some of that going on in
 
01:20:25.350 --> 01:20:25.360 align:start position:0%
Manchester as well
 
01:20:28.229 --> 01:20:28.239 align:start position:0%
so we have a program we call the
 
01:20:30.350 --> 01:20:30.360 align:start position:0%
Manifest education hardship that's a
 
01:20:32.310 --> 01:20:32.320 align:start position:0%
program which is tuition if you have a
 
01:20:34.709 --> 01:20:34.719 align:start position:0%
student not meeting the interest that
 
01:20:36.950 --> 01:20:36.960 align:start position:0%
student in that school district and they
 
01:20:39.030 --> 01:20:39.040 align:start position:0%
need help the parent can come and
 
01:20:40.870 --> 01:20:40.880 align:start position:0%
request of that school district to have
 
01:20:42.790 --> 01:20:42.800 align:start position:0%
the child placed due to this manifest
 
01:20:44.990 --> 01:20:45.000 align:start position:0%
education hardship in another school
 
01:20:47.070 --> 01:20:47.080 align:start position:0%
this quite frankly is not working well
 
01:20:49.350 --> 01:20:49.360 align:start position:0%
at all we have very few of these that
 
01:20:51.189 --> 01:20:51.199 align:start position:0%
are actually accepted or even approved
 
01:20:53.350 --> 01:20:53.360 align:start position:0%
by the State Board of Education this
 
01:20:56.189 --> 01:20:56.199 align:start position:0%
program right here is going to help us
 
01:20:58.390 --> 01:20:58.400 align:start position:0%
attain these efficiencies to scale we
 
01:21:00.390 --> 01:21:00.400 align:start position:0%
need in this state we've often times
 
01:21:03.310 --> 01:21:03.320 align:start position:0%
talked about restructuring our saus we
 
01:21:07.070 --> 01:21:07.080 align:start position:0%
have 107 saus some of the saus are right
 
01:21:08.950 --> 01:21:08.960 align:start position:0%
beside each other and very small
 
01:21:11.350 --> 01:21:11.360 align:start position:0%
districts why couldn't they share some
 
01:21:13.110 --> 01:21:13.120 align:start position:0%
of the curriculum and instruction
 
01:21:17.030 --> 01:21:17.040 align:start position:0%
between the two districts which some do
 
01:21:19.629 --> 01:21:19.639 align:start position:0%
if I have school over a over here and
 
01:21:22.709 --> 01:21:22.719 align:start position:0%
school B over here and school a does not
 
01:21:25.629 --> 01:21:25.639 align:start position:0%
have a good science program but B does
 
01:21:27.430 --> 01:21:27.440 align:start position:0%
why not have the student being able to
 
01:21:29.390 --> 01:21:29.400 align:start position:0%
go into that open enrollment school over
 
01:21:32.110 --> 01:21:32.120 align:start position:0%
there in B to get that chemistry class
 
01:21:35.870 --> 01:21:35.880 align:start position:0%
which I can't offer in a it's logical so
 
01:21:37.390 --> 01:21:37.400 align:start position:0%
what we're doing was we're going to be
 
01:21:40.229 --> 01:21:40.239 align:start position:0%
able to share special education services
 
01:21:42.229 --> 01:21:42.239 align:start position:0%
we're going to be able to go have the
 
01:21:44.430 --> 01:21:44.440 align:start position:0%
student decide curriculum where that is
 
01:21:46.910 --> 01:21:46.920 align:start position:0%
best for them the best fit it's going to
 
01:21:49.830 --> 01:21:49.840 align:start position:0%
be a very coste effective program and it
 
01:21:52.950 --> 01:21:52.960 align:start position:0%
elim it will eliminate duplication of
 
01:21:55.270 --> 01:21:55.280 align:start position:0%
services where is this occurring right
 
01:21:57.110 --> 01:21:57.120 align:start position:0%
now do we have any open enrollment
 
01:21:59.709 --> 01:21:59.719 align:start position:0%
schools in the state right now yes we do
 
01:22:01.870 --> 01:22:01.880 align:start position:0%
Prospect Mountain for example is one
 
01:22:04.510 --> 01:22:04.520 align:start position:0%
alad and Barnstead have that and they
 
01:22:06.950 --> 01:22:06.960 align:start position:0%
have a a leader down there administrator
 
01:22:09.750 --> 01:22:09.760 align:start position:0%
who has been quoted saying I welcome any
 
01:22:11.990 --> 01:22:12.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire family to evaluate our
 
01:22:14.750 --> 01:22:14.760 align:start position:0%
strengths and weaknesses and decide for
 
01:22:17.229 --> 01:22:17.239 align:start position:0%
themselves where their CH children can
 
01:22:20.870 --> 01:22:20.880 align:start position:0%
be best served isn't that wonderful that
 
01:22:22.470 --> 01:22:22.480 align:start position:0%
comes from an administrator in a school
 
01:22:25.750 --> 01:22:25.760 align:start position:0%
district he's open to open enrollment
 
01:22:28.110 --> 01:22:28.120 align:start position:0%
so what we have right now we've
 
01:22:30.790 --> 01:22:30.800 align:start position:0%
clarified the Open Enrollment school and
 
01:22:33.790 --> 01:22:33.800 align:start position:0%
the sending school that EXC which is the
 
01:22:35.070 --> 01:22:35.080 align:start position:0%
receiving School the Open Enrollment
 
01:22:36.750 --> 01:22:36.760 align:start position:0%
school is the sending School how does
 
01:22:39.990 --> 01:22:40.000 align:start position:0%
the payment work 80% of the funds from
 
01:22:42.110 --> 01:22:42.120 align:start position:0%
that sending School District go to the
 
01:22:44.709 --> 01:22:44.719 align:start position:0%
open enrollment School the sending
 
01:22:45.990 --> 01:22:46.000 align:start position:0%
District still carries the
 
01:22:47.990 --> 01:22:48.000 align:start position:0%
responsibilities for special education
 
01:22:51.189 --> 01:22:51.199 align:start position:0%
20% is Left Behind so in conclusion I
 
01:22:53.669 --> 01:22:53.679 align:start position:0%
would ask you to support open enrollment
 
01:22:55.830 --> 01:22:55.840 align:start position:0%
it's a p pathway for us to get
 
01:22:57.790 --> 01:22:57.800 align:start position:0%
efficiency of scale in the state which
 
01:23:00.590 --> 01:23:00.600 align:start position:0%
we drastically
 
01:23:02.750 --> 01:23:02.760 align:start position:0%
need representative Granger has
 
01:23:04.229 --> 01:23:04.239 align:start position:0%
requested a roll call is that
 
01:23:04.239 --> 01:23:06.229 align:start position:0%
requested a roll call is that
sufficiently

01:23:06.229 --> 01:23:06.239 align:start position:0%
sufficiently
 
01:23:08.590 --> 01:23:08.600 align:start position:0%
seconded that is sufficiently seconded
 
01:23:10.149 --> 01:23:10.159 align:start position:0%
this will be a roll call vote members
 
01:23:23.430 --> 01:23:23.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:06.709 --> 01:24:06.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:08.110 --> 01:24:08.120 align:start position:0%
the questions on the majority committee
 
01:24:10.629 --> 01:24:10.639 align:start position:0%
report about to pass on House Bill 771
 
01:24:12.350 --> 01:24:12.360 align:start position:0%
and this is a roll call
 
01:24:14.750 --> 01:24:14.760 align:start position:0%
vote representative Weinstein is
 
01:24:20.790 --> 01:24:20.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:25.149 --> 01:24:25.159 align:start position:0%
inquiry thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker
 
01:24:27.950 --> 01:24:27.960 align:start position:0%
here if I know that this bill would
 
01:24:30.070 --> 01:24:30.080 align:start position:0%
create a financial burden on the sending
 
01:24:31.870 --> 01:24:31.880 align:start position:0%
districts and would who would be
 
01:24:34.430 --> 01:24:34.440 align:start position:0%
required to pay 80% of their average per
 
01:24:37.750 --> 01:24:37.760 align:start position:0%
pupil costs to receiving schools and if
 
01:24:39.990 --> 01:24:40.000 align:start position:0%
I know that this bill creates a control
 
01:24:42.750 --> 01:24:42.760 align:start position:0%
and benefit imbalance where receiving
 
01:24:45.030 --> 01:24:45.040 align:start position:0%
districts have the power to choose
 
01:24:47.590 --> 01:24:47.600 align:start position:0%
whether to enroll additional students
 
01:24:49.229 --> 01:24:49.239 align:start position:0%
and would benefit financially from
 
01:24:49.239 --> 01:24:50.270 align:start position:0%
and would benefit financially from
increased

01:24:50.270 --> 01:24:50.280 align:start position:0%
increased
 
01:24:52.510 --> 01:24:52.520 align:start position:0%
enrollment and if I know this would
 
01:24:55.189 --> 01:24:55.199 align:start position:0%
drain resources from already underfunded
 
01:24:57.550 --> 01:24:57.560 align:start position:0%
districts and exacerbate existing
 
01:25:01.070 --> 01:25:01.080 align:start position:0%
educational inequalities and lastly if I
 
01:25:02.669 --> 01:25:02.679 align:start position:0%
know that we are waiting for a ruling
 
01:25:04.229 --> 01:25:04.239 align:start position:0%
from the New Hampshire Supreme Court
 
01:25:06.750 --> 01:25:06.760 align:start position:0%
related to open enrollment schools then
 
01:25:08.830 --> 01:25:08.840 align:start position:0%
would I now press the red button to
 
01:25:10.709 --> 01:25:10.719 align:start position:0%
defeat this motion thank

parliamentary inquiry thank you very
 
01:25:17.149 --> 01:25:17.159 align:start position:0%
much Mr Speaker if I know this program
 
01:25:19.189 --> 01:25:19.199 align:start position:0%
is coste effective and has the potential
 
01:25:21.870 --> 01:25:21.880 align:start position:0%
to eliminate duplication of programming
 
01:25:23.590 --> 01:25:23.600 align:start position:0%
in neighboring schools and school
 
01:25:23.600 --> 01:25:24.910 align:start position:0%

districts
 
01:25:27.189 --> 01:25:27.199 align:start position:0%
and lastly if I also know this program
 
01:25:30.350 --> 01:25:30.360 align:start position:0%
offers Parents Choice while keeping
 
01:25:34.030 --> 01:25:34.040 align:start position:0%
public dollars in public schools would I
 
01:25:36.270 --> 01:25:36.280 align:start position:0%

representative Murray's recognized to

01:27:47.229 --> 01:27:47.239 align:start position:0%
colleagues though we can all agree that
 
01:27:49.030 --> 01:27:49.040 align:start position:0%
nursing shortages within our schools is
 
01:27:51.390 --> 01:27:51.400 align:start position:0%
a problem worthy of solving the majority
 
01:27:53.189 --> 01:27:53.199 align:start position:0%
of nursing shortages in school settings
 
01:27:55.030 --> 01:27:55.040 align:start position:0%
are not due to Bur some requirements
 
01:27:56.470 --> 01:27:56.480 align:start position:0%
within the department of education's
 
01:27:58.910 --> 01:27:58.920 align:start position:0%
certification requirements but are more
 
01:28:00.629 --> 01:28:00.639 align:start position:0%
likely due to insufficient pay that
 
01:28:02.350 --> 01:28:02.360 align:start position:0%
matches the level of work and care that
 
01:28:04.229 --> 01:28:04.239 align:start position:0%
our nurses provide in school communities
 
01:28:07.590 --> 01:28:07.600 align:start position:0%
day after day HB 208 as amended quite
 
01:28:09.390 --> 01:28:09.400 align:start position:0%
simply removes all certification
 
01:28:11.709 --> 01:28:11.719 align:start position:0%
requirements within the doe and solely
 
01:28:13.750 --> 01:28:13.760 align:start position:0%
relies on a single associates degree
 
01:28:17.070 --> 01:28:17.080 align:start position:0%
within the oplc removing continuing educ
 
01:28:19.390 --> 01:28:19.400 align:start position:0%
excuse me continuing education towards a
 
01:28:21.629 --> 01:28:21.639 align:start position:0%
bachelor's degree in nursing there are
 
01:28:23.430 --> 01:28:23.440 align:start position:0%
many instances in which our nurses in
 
01:28:24.709 --> 01:28:24.719 align:start position:0%
our school community Comm unities serve
 
01:28:26.189 --> 01:28:26.199 align:start position:0%
in ways that are unique to school
 
01:28:28.550 --> 01:28:28.560 align:start position:0%
settings where pediatric medical needs
 
01:28:30.750 --> 01:28:30.760 align:start position:0%
exist at higher rates and students with
 
01:28:32.229 --> 01:28:32.239 align:start position:0%
complex medical needs come into the
 
01:28:34.430 --> 01:28:34.440 align:start position:0%
building daily there are a Litany of
 
01:28:36.350 --> 01:28:36.360 align:start position:0%
unique circumstances that require School
 
01:28:38.790 --> 01:28:38.800 align:start position:0%
nurses to be supported uh regarding the
 
01:28:40.950 --> 01:28:40.960 align:start position:0%
needs of a building District staff and
 
01:28:42.270 --> 01:28:42.280 align:start position:0%
the unique body of students in
 
01:28:44.229 --> 01:28:44.239 align:start position:0%
attendance throughout the day
 
01:28:45.830 --> 01:28:45.840 align:start position:0%
eliminating the entirety of the
 
01:28:47.510 --> 01:28:47.520 align:start position:0%
additional nursing certification within
 
01:28:49.830 --> 01:28:49.840 align:start position:0%
the doe increases legal liabilities to
 
01:28:52.030 --> 01:28:52.040 align:start position:0%
schools and districts nurses have
 
01:28:53.229 --> 01:28:53.239 align:start position:0%
countless other things that they are
 
01:28:54.870 --> 01:28:54.880 align:start position:0%
tasked with on a daily basis
 
01:28:56.550 --> 01:28:56.560 align:start position:0%
certifications around nursing and
 
01:28:58.830 --> 01:28:58.840 align:start position:0%
special education impl implementation in
 
01:29:01.350 --> 01:29:01.360 align:start position:0%
school settings are vital to ensuring
 
01:29:03.350 --> 01:29:03.360 align:start position:0%
that the child um that the care of a
 
01:29:05.149 --> 01:29:05.159 align:start position:0%
child is carefully collaborated with

providers Specialists parents and
 
01:29:09.990 --> 01:29:10.000 align:start position:0%
teachers finally if we are to remove all
 
01:29:11.229 --> 01:29:11.239 align:start position:0%
of the Department of Education
 
01:29:13.030 --> 01:29:13.040 align:start position:0%
certification as it relates to school
 
01:29:15.629 --> 01:29:15.639 align:start position:0%
nursing there are critical components to
 
01:29:17.910 --> 01:29:17.920 align:start position:0%
nursing that could be
 
01:29:20.990 --> 01:29:21.000 align:start position:0%
impacted such as school management case
 
01:29:23.470 --> 01:29:23.480 align:start position:0%
DCF management health records management
 
01:29:26.030 --> 01:29:26.040 align:start position:0%
infectious disease management and a
 
01:29:28.470 --> 01:29:28.480 align:start position:0%
Litany of other things please vote no on
 
01:29:30.550 --> 01:29:30.560 align:start position:0%
the motion of V to pass as amended so
 
01:29:32.109 --> 01:29:32.119 align:start position:0%
another motion can be made and Mr
 
01:29:35.430 --> 01:29:35.440 align:start position:0%
Speaker I humbly ask for a division
 
01:29:37.470 --> 01:29:37.480 align:start position:0%
vote representative cordelli is
 
01:29:38.830 --> 01:29:38.840 align:start position:0%
recognized speak in support of the
 
01:29:38.840 --> 01:29:40.030 align:start position:0%
recognized speak in support of the
committee

01:29:40.030 --> 01:29:40.040 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:29:43.189 --> 01:29:43.199 align:start position:0%
report thank you Mr Speaker there are
 
01:29:45.910 --> 01:29:45.920 align:start position:0%
two primary reasons for the passage of
 
01:29:48.070 --> 01:29:48.080 align:start position:0%
this amended bill which eliminates the
 
01:29:50.709 --> 01:29:50.719 align:start position:0%
need for the Department of Education
 
01:29:53.470 --> 01:29:53.480 align:start position:0%
certification of School nurses reason
 
01:29:53.480 --> 01:29:54.990 align:start position:0%
certification of School nurses reason
one

01:29:54.990 --> 01:29:55.000 align:start position:0%
one
 
01:29:56.669 --> 01:29:56.679 align:start position:0%
what does the Department of Education
 
01:29:57.790 --> 01:29:57.800 align:start position:0%
know about
 
01:30:00.149 --> 01:30:00.159 align:start position:0%
nursing and we have a board of nursing
 
01:30:02.149 --> 01:30:02.159 align:start position:0%
to license
 
01:30:05.950 --> 01:30:05.960 align:start position:0%
nurses let's eliminate one unnecessary
 
01:30:09.990 --> 01:30:10.000 align:start position:0%
license and the cost how about the cost
 
01:30:13.910 --> 01:30:13.920 align:start position:0%
to the applicant it currently cost uh an
 
01:30:17.030 --> 01:30:17.040 align:start position:0%
applicant to get that certification $120
 
01:30:19.030 --> 01:30:19.040 align:start position:0%
for a three-year certification and it's
 
01:30:21.070 --> 01:30:21.080 align:start position:0%
going up to
 
01:30:24.030 --> 01:30:24.040 align:start position:0%
$150 we have heard that districts need
 
01:30:27.030 --> 01:30:27.040 align:start position:0%
need pediatric or specially trained
 
01:30:29.629 --> 01:30:29.639 align:start position:0%
nurses the Department of Education is
 
01:30:32.229 --> 01:30:32.239 align:start position:0%
not going to do that training you know
 
01:30:33.990 --> 01:30:34.000 align:start position:0%
how they award
 
01:30:36.149 --> 01:30:36.159 align:start position:0%
certifications they look at the
 
01:30:38.149 --> 01:30:38.159 align:start position:0%
transcript they look at the work
 
01:30:40.310 --> 01:30:40.320 align:start position:0%
experience and ask for the
 
01:30:43.629 --> 01:30:43.639 align:start position:0%
money that's how they award
 
01:30:46.229 --> 01:30:46.239 align:start position:0%
certifications and we think that maybe
 
01:30:49.310 --> 01:30:49.320 align:start position:0%
local school districts are smart enough
 
01:30:52.910 --> 01:30:52.920 align:start position:0%
to actually hire a nurse who has the uh
 
01:30:55.709 --> 01:30:55.719 align:start position:0%
proper training in not a hospice
 
01:30:58.310 --> 01:30:58.320 align:start position:0%
nurse reason
 
01:31:00.790 --> 01:31:00.800 align:start position:0%
two licensing from the Department of
 
01:31:04.270 --> 01:31:04.280 align:start position:0%
Education certification costs more to
 
01:31:08.270 --> 01:31:08.280 align:start position:0%
the retirement cost to a school district
 
01:31:10.310 --> 01:31:10.320 align:start position:0%
due to an obsolete uh
 
01:31:12.430 --> 01:31:12.440 align:start position:0%
provision here are the numbers the
 
01:31:16.030 --> 01:31:16.040 align:start position:0%
retirement system charges a district
 
01:31:20.229 --> 01:31:20.239 align:start position:0%
135% of wages for a non-licensed
 
01:31:24.189 --> 01:31:24.199 align:start position:0%
employee but for a doe certified
 
01:31:27.590 --> 01:31:27.600 align:start position:0%
employee charges
 
01:31:31.229 --> 01:31:31.239 align:start position:0%
19.6% and who gets that 6% differential
 
01:31:33.870 --> 01:31:33.880 align:start position:0%
the retirement system not the employee
 
01:31:35.070 --> 01:31:35.080 align:start position:0%
when they
 
01:31:38.870 --> 01:31:38.880 align:start position:0%
retire So based on the number of nurses
 
01:31:42.030 --> 01:31:42.040 align:start position:0%
in the system this could mean a savings
 
01:31:46.510 --> 01:31:46.520 align:start position:0%
to school districts of over $1.6
 
01:31:49.350 --> 01:31:49.360 align:start position:0%
million so let's add this up reason
 
01:31:51.750 --> 01:31:51.760 align:start position:0%
number one elimination of unnecessary
 
01:31:54.510 --> 01:31:54.520 align:start position:0%
licensing and less cost to appli against
 
01:31:54.520 --> 01:31:55.270 align:start position:0%
licensing and less cost to appli against
a

01:31:55.270 --> 01:31:55.280 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:31:58.870 --> 01:31:58.880 align:start position:0%
win reason number two potential large
 
01:32:00.870 --> 01:32:00.880 align:start position:0%
savings to local
 
01:32:04.709 --> 01:32:04.719 align:start position:0%
districts a win so let's add up the
 
01:32:08.030 --> 01:32:08.040 align:start position:0%
legislation it's a win-win solution
 
01:32:10.350 --> 01:32:10.360 align:start position:0%
thank you vote
 
01:32:12.669 --> 01:32:12.679 align:start position:0%

01:33:38.709 --> 01:33:38.719 align:start position:0%
inquiry thank you Mr Speaker if I know
 
01:33:41.109 --> 01:33:41.119 align:start position:0%
that this bill as amended removes all of
 
01:33:43.709 --> 01:33:43.719 align:start position:0%
the school nursing requirements already
 
01:33:45.550 --> 01:33:45.560 align:start position:0%
within the Department of Education
 
01:33:48.270 --> 01:33:48.280 align:start position:0%
statutes and if I know that a p
 
01:33:50.510 --> 01:33:50.520 align:start position:0%
pediatric background really is a
 
01:33:53.229 --> 01:33:53.239 align:start position:0%
necessity for a school nurse and if I
 
01:33:56.149 --> 01:33:56.159 align:start position:0%
know that School nursing is a specialty
 
01:33:58.070 --> 01:33:58.080 align:start position:0%
that requires skills and knowledge
 
01:34:01.189 --> 01:34:01.199 align:start position:0%
Beyond basic nurses nursing for example
 
01:34:03.270 --> 01:34:03.280 align:start position:0%
knowledge related to special education
 
01:34:05.709 --> 01:34:05.719 align:start position:0%

01:34:10.629 --> 01:34:10.639 align:start position:0%
made representative Freeman's recognized
 
01:34:14.790 --> 01:34:14.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:17.629 --> 01:34:17.639 align:start position:0%
inquiry thank you Mr Speaker
 
01:34:20.350 --> 01:34:20.360 align:start position:0%
colleagues if I know that currently as a
 
01:34:22.830 --> 01:34:22.840 align:start position:0%
nation we are facing a critical shortage
 
01:34:25.030 --> 01:34:25.040 align:start position:0%
of healthcare profession professionals
 
01:34:26.990 --> 01:34:27.000 align:start position:0%
and if I further know that nurses are
 
01:34:29.790 --> 01:34:29.800 align:start position:0%
very heavily licensed vetted and
 
01:34:33.310 --> 01:34:33.320 align:start position:0%
credentials and cherish their lure it
 
01:34:36.149 --> 01:34:36.159 align:start position:0%
would not jeopardize such and finally if
 
01:34:38.149 --> 01:34:38.159 align:start position:0%
I know that our children are a precious
 
01:34:40.750 --> 01:34:40.760 align:start position:0%
commodity and School nurses or potential
 
01:34:43.310 --> 01:34:43.320 align:start position:0%
School nurses understand this and would
 
01:34:46.149 --> 01:34:46.159 align:start position:0%
not put our children In Harm's Way or
 
01:34:48.350 --> 01:34:48.360 align:start position:0%
jeopardize their hard- earned licensure
 
01:34:51.070 --> 01:34:51.080 align:start position:0%
would I now press the green button to
 
01:34:53.149 --> 01:34:53.159 align:start position:0%
pass this piece of Common Sense
 
01:34:53.159 --> 01:34:55.109 align:start position:0%

officials at fishing game administrative
 
01:39:04.350 --> 01:39:04.360 align:start position:0%
and enforcement encourage the tabling of
 
01:39:07.030 --> 01:39:07.040 align:start position:0%
this rather than killing it then I would
 
01:39:09.550 --> 01:39:09.560 align:start position:0%
vote uh I would push the green button

01:39:20.870 --> 01:39:20.880 align:start position:0%
for parliamentary inquiry thank you Mr
 
01:39:24.270 --> 01:39:24.280 align:start position:0%
Speaker Mr Speaker if I know that this
 
01:39:26.790 --> 01:39:26.800 align:start position:0%
was a widely debated and listened to
 
01:39:29.229 --> 01:39:29.239 align:start position:0%
bill in the committee and that even the
 
01:39:31.350 --> 01:39:31.360 align:start position:0%
minority agreed that the way that it was
 
01:39:32.669 --> 01:39:32.679 align:start position:0%
written was
 
01:39:34.910 --> 01:39:34.920 align:start position:0%
unworkable but Mr Speaker if I know that
 
01:39:36.870 --> 01:39:36.880 align:start position:0%
the minority also wanted to introduce an
 
01:39:38.470 --> 01:39:38.480 align:start position:0%
amendment that was so radically
 
01:39:40.070 --> 01:39:40.080 align:start position:0%
different that tabling this would not
 
01:39:41.390 --> 01:39:41.400 align:start position:0%
make any difference because they could
 
01:39:42.990 --> 01:39:43.000 align:start position:0%
still bring that Amendment as a new bill
 
01:39:45.870 --> 01:39:45.880 align:start position:0%
next year so that tabling serves no
 
01:39:47.870 --> 01:39:47.880 align:start position:0%
function and Mr Speaker if I know that
 
01:39:49.589 --> 01:39:49.599 align:start position:0%
fish and game has already said that the
 
01:39:51.589 --> 01:39:51.599 align:start position:0%
major portions that were the goal of
 
01:39:53.430 --> 01:39:53.440 align:start position:0%
this bill were going to be handled in
 
01:39:55.629 --> 01:39:55.639 align:start position:0%
rules and those rules are going in front
 
01:39:58.350 --> 01:39:58.360 align:start position:0%
of the public this summer then Mr
 
01:40:00.910 --> 01:40:00.920 align:start position:0%
Speaker would I vote no to table so that
 
01:40:04.229 --> 01:40:04.239 align:start position:0%
we can get on with the itl thank you the
 
01:40:06.310 --> 01:40:06.320 align:start position:0%
question is whether L House Bill 589 on

underlying bill here is the perception
 
01:46:34.910 --> 01:46:34.920 align:start position:0%
that this is an attack on Medicaid an
 
01:46:36.910 --> 01:46:36.920 align:start position:0%
attack on medical coverage for the
 
01:46:39.390 --> 01:46:39.400 align:start position:0%
poorest of the poor for desperately
 
01:46:42.910 --> 01:46:42.920 align:start position:0%
needed medical services so this
 
01:46:46.750 --> 01:46:46.760 align:start position:0%
amendment makes the Medicaid question a
 
01:46:49.550 --> 01:46:49.560 align:start position:0%
non-issue because it moves dollar for
 
01:46:52.109 --> 01:46:52.119 align:start position:0%
dooll the savings that the department
 
01:46:54.189 --> 01:46:54.199 align:start position:0%
will receive and not covering
 
01:46:56.790 --> 01:46:56.800 align:start position:0%
non-therapeutic neonatal
 
01:46:59.390 --> 01:46:59.400 align:start position:0%
circumcision to a vision screening a
 
01:47:01.669 --> 01:47:01.679 align:start position:0%
pediatric vision screening program that
 
01:47:04.390 --> 01:47:04.400 align:start position:0%
almost every other state has and that
 
01:47:06.669 --> 01:47:06.679 align:start position:0%
has had broad support in this chamber
 
01:47:09.189 --> 01:47:09.199 align:start position:0%
for several years so I want to talk
 
01:47:12.790 --> 01:47:12.800 align:start position:0%
about why that moving that coverage from
 
01:47:15.589 --> 01:47:15.599 align:start position:0%
one one procedure to another or to
 
01:47:18.910 --> 01:47:18.920 align:start position:0%
another program is
 
01:47:21.910 --> 01:47:21.920 align:start position:0%
appropriate non- therapeutic neonatal
 
01:47:24.510 --> 01:47:24.520 align:start position:0%
circumcision is not considered medically
 
01:47:27.950 --> 01:47:27.960 align:start position:0%
necessary by any medical organization in
 
01:47:32.070 --> 01:47:32.080 align:start position:0%
the world including this country
 
01:47:36.070 --> 01:47:36.080 align:start position:0%
including this state no medical
 
01:47:38.270 --> 01:47:38.280 align:start position:0%
organization in the world considers it
 
01:47:38.280 --> 01:47:39.149 align:start position:0%
organization in the world considers it
medically

01:47:39.149 --> 01:47:39.159 align:start position:0%
medically
 
01:47:41.550 --> 01:47:41.560 align:start position:0%
necessary and that you understand that
 
01:47:43.910 --> 01:47:43.920 align:start position:0%
right because 80% of the world is not
 
01:47:46.310 --> 01:47:46.320 align:start position:0%
circumcised by default and we don't
 
01:47:50.070 --> 01:47:50.080 align:start position:0%
circumcise any male mammal we don't
 
01:47:54.310 --> 01:47:54.320 align:start position:0%
circumcise horses dogs cats sheep goats
 
01:47:56.510 --> 01:47:56.520 align:start position:0%
and none of them seem to have widespread
 
01:48:00.270 --> 01:48:00.280 align:start position:0%
problems in fact only one in 11,000
 
01:48:03.709 --> 01:48:03.719 align:start position:0%
adult intact men have a need for a
 
01:48:05.790 --> 01:48:05.800 align:start position:0%
circumcision later in
 
01:48:09.270 --> 01:48:09.280 align:start position:0%
life some in this country some medical
 
01:48:12.310 --> 01:48:12.320 align:start position:0%
organizations consider neonatal non-
 
01:48:15.550 --> 01:48:15.560 align:start position:0%
therapeutic circumcision a preventative
 
01:48:18.910 --> 01:48:18.920 align:start position:0%
measure but while only 1 in 11,000 in
 
01:48:21.709 --> 01:48:21.719 align:start position:0%
Tech men need circumcision later in life
 
01:48:24.589 --> 01:48:24.599 align:start position:0%
one in 20 people people will need an
 
01:48:26.910 --> 01:48:26.920 align:start position:0%
appendectomy one and seven will need
 
01:48:29.750 --> 01:48:29.760 align:start position:0%
their tonsils out we do not remove the
 
01:48:32.830 --> 01:48:32.840 align:start position:0%
appendixes of infants because they might
 
01:48:34.990 --> 01:48:35.000 align:start position:0%
need that surgery later we do not remove
 
01:48:37.030 --> 01:48:37.040 align:start position:0%
the tonsils of infants we don't remove
 
01:48:39.430 --> 01:48:39.440 align:start position:0%
any healthy tissue from an infant
 
01:48:40.870 --> 01:48:40.880 align:start position:0%
because they might have an infection
 
01:48:43.430 --> 01:48:43.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:47.510 --> 01:48:47.520 align:start position:0%
life on the other hand one in six
 
01:48:51.270 --> 01:48:51.280 align:start position:0%
circumcised infants experience pain and
 
01:48:54.950 --> 01:48:54.960 align:start position:0%
excessive bleeding one in 20 experience
 
01:48:59.109 --> 01:48:59.119 align:start position:0%
a serious infection and many thousands
 
01:49:01.950 --> 01:49:01.960 align:start position:0%
experience like the cause of this bill
 
01:49:05.830 --> 01:49:05.840 align:start position:0%
going in last year lifelong debilitating
 
01:49:08.589 --> 01:49:08.599 align:start position:0%
conditions such as urinary
 
01:49:11.669 --> 01:49:11.679 align:start position:0%
problems uh recurring infections
 
01:49:14.149 --> 01:49:14.159 align:start position:0%
disfigurement and sexual
 
01:49:18.109 --> 01:49:18.119 align:start position:0%
dysfunction and in this country where
 
01:49:21.550 --> 01:49:21.560 align:start position:0%
1.4 million male babies are
 
01:49:24.270 --> 01:49:24.280 align:start position:0%
circumcised uh about a hundred little
 
01:49:26.629 --> 01:49:26.639 align:start position:0%
boys one day old
 
01:49:29.750 --> 01:49:29.760 align:start position:0%
infants end up dying from complications
 
01:49:30.950 --> 01:49:30.960 align:start position:0%
because of a
 
01:49:32.709 --> 01:49:32.719 align:start position:0%
circumcision so while those
 
01:49:35.709 --> 01:49:35.719 align:start position:0%
organizations may say there are some we
 
01:49:37.950 --> 01:49:37.960 align:start position:0%
think maybe benefits and perhaps the
 
01:49:40.550 --> 01:49:40.560 align:start position:0%
benefits might outweigh the risks I
 
01:49:42.910 --> 01:49:42.920 align:start position:0%
would uh encourage people to ask the
 
01:49:44.990 --> 01:49:45.000 align:start position:0%
parents of those hundred baby boys who
 
01:49:47.030 --> 01:49:47.040 align:start position:0%
died whether the benefits outway the
 
01:49:49.629 --> 01:49:49.639 align:start position:0%
risk or ask the adult men who have
 
01:49:51.830 --> 01:49:51.840 align:start position:0%
permanent disfigurement and dysfunction
 
01:49:54.430 --> 01:49:54.440 align:start position:0%
whether the benefits outweigh the
 
01:49:58.149 --> 01:49:58.159 align:start position:0%
risk it is the only non-reconstructive
 
01:50:02.030 --> 01:50:02.040 align:start position:0%
non- therapeutic cosmetic procedure that
 
01:50:04.830 --> 01:50:04.840 align:start position:0%
we cover with taxpayer
 
01:50:08.270 --> 01:50:08.280 align:start position:0%
dollars and I know that culturally it's
 
01:50:10.669 --> 01:50:10.679 align:start position:0%
hard to move past the things that we've
 
01:50:12.350 --> 01:50:12.360 align:start position:0%
always considered to be
 
01:50:14.709 --> 01:50:14.719 align:start position:0%
normal the expectation that we know how
 
01:50:16.430 --> 01:50:16.440 align:start position:0%
to predict the world helps us feel in
 
01:50:18.709 --> 01:50:18.719 align:start position:0%
control of a world that is not
 
01:50:21.950 --> 01:50:21.960 align:start position:0%
controllable but think of this the exact
 
01:50:24.910 --> 01:50:24.920 align:start position:0%
analogous procedure in a female child
 
01:50:27.510 --> 01:50:27.520 align:start position:0%
the removal of the clitoral hood is not
 
01:50:29.510 --> 01:50:29.520 align:start position:0%
paid for by taxpayer dollars is not
 
01:50:31.669 --> 01:50:31.679 align:start position:0%
covered under any kind of insurance it's
 
01:50:33.629 --> 01:50:33.639 align:start position:0%
actually illegal you will be sent to
 
01:50:36.990 --> 01:50:37.000 align:start position:0%
prison because on a logical level be
 
01:50:38.550 --> 01:50:38.560 align:start position:0%
when we get Beyond what's comfortable
 
01:50:41.310 --> 01:50:41.320 align:start position:0%
and normal and culturally acceptable on
 
01:50:44.589 --> 01:50:44.599 align:start position:0%
a logical level we know that the genital
 
01:50:48.189 --> 01:50:48.199 align:start position:0%
cutting of a tiny baby infant one day
 
01:50:50.790 --> 01:50:50.800 align:start position:0%
old or a few hours old is wrong we know
 
01:50:53.350 --> 01:50:53.360 align:start position:0%
that so I although I I passionately
 
01:50:55.270 --> 01:50:55.280 align:start position:0%
support single-payer health care I don't
 
01:50:57.550 --> 01:50:57.560 align:start position:0%
support this coverage any more than I
 
01:50:59.990 --> 01:51:00.000 align:start position:0%
would support any other cosmetic
 
01:51:02.790 --> 01:51:02.800 align:start position:0%
procedure on an eight-hour old infant or
 
01:51:05.270 --> 01:51:05.280 align:start position:0%
anymore that I would support any
 
01:51:07.629 --> 01:51:07.639 align:start position:0%
procedure that could harm a
 
01:51:10.510 --> 01:51:10.520 align:start position:0%
baby surgery on a tiny piece of healthy
 
01:51:14.910 --> 01:51:14.920 align:start position:0%
flesh for no other reason than cultural
 
01:51:14.920 --> 01:51:16.870 align:start position:0%
flesh for no other reason than cultural
expectation

01:51:16.870 --> 01:51:16.880 align:start position:0%
expectation
 
01:51:19.750 --> 01:51:19.760 align:start position:0%
however I hope while it may be
 
01:51:21.109 --> 01:51:21.119 align:start position:0%
controversial whether there's medical
 
01:51:23.030 --> 01:51:23.040 align:start position:0%
benefits to it or not I hope it's not
 
01:51:24.910 --> 01:51:24.920 align:start position:0%
controversial that vision is a
 
01:51:24.920 --> 01:51:26.550 align:start position:0%
controversial that vision is a
legitimate

01:51:26.550 --> 01:51:26.560 align:start position:0%
legitimate
 
01:51:28.669 --> 01:51:28.679 align:start position:0%
medical uh Health
 
01:51:31.270 --> 01:51:31.280 align:start position:0%
Care in fact all those organizations
 
01:51:33.750 --> 01:51:33.760 align:start position:0%
that don't think that non- therapeutic
 
01:51:35.629 --> 01:51:35.639 align:start position:0%
neonatal circumcision is medically
 
01:51:38.430 --> 01:51:38.440 align:start position:0%
necessary they think that Vision Care is
 
01:51:40.270 --> 01:51:40.280 align:start position:0%
uh legitimate health care so this
 
01:51:42.669 --> 01:51:42.679 align:start position:0%
amendment moves those savings dollar for
 
01:51:45.870 --> 01:51:45.880 align:start position:0%
dooll into a pediatric vision screening
 
01:51:48.510 --> 01:51:48.520 align:start position:0%
program which has been before this house
 
01:51:50.669 --> 01:51:50.679 align:start position:0%
U multiple times which Most states have
 
01:51:52.750 --> 01:51:52.760 align:start position:0%
the vast majority of states have a
 
01:51:55.589 --> 01:51:55.599 align:start position:0%
Medicaid paid for Pediatric vision
 
01:51:58.750 --> 01:51:58.760 align:start position:0%
screening program because
 
01:52:01.030 --> 01:52:01.040 align:start position:0%
children don't know that their Visions
 
01:52:03.550 --> 01:52:03.560 align:start position:0%
messed up because it's the only Vision
 
01:52:06.589 --> 01:52:06.599 align:start position:0%
they ever had so they don't realize that
 
01:52:08.870 --> 01:52:08.880 align:start position:0%
not seeing the Blackboard or the the
 
01:52:11.790 --> 01:52:11.800 align:start position:0%
screen is not normal and so they don't
 
01:52:15.550 --> 01:52:15.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:18.589 --> 01:52:18.599 align:start position:0%
problems as I said Most states have this
 
01:52:20.870 --> 01:52:20.880 align:start position:0%
this is exper the same exact language in
 
01:52:22.950 --> 01:52:22.960 align:start position:0%
this amendment is the bill from the last
 
01:52:25.470 --> 01:52:25.480 align:start position:0%
term it was retained in 23 it was
 
01:52:29.310 --> 01:52:29.320 align:start position:0%
interim studied in 24 DHHS was fine with
 
01:52:32.550 --> 01:52:32.560 align:start position:0%
it they said that the uh money was
 
01:52:34.510 --> 01:52:34.520 align:start position:0%
fairly small it turns out miraculously
 
01:52:36.069 --> 01:52:36.079 align:start position:0%
about the same amount that they will
 
01:52:39.229 --> 01:52:39.239 align:start position:0%
save from circumcision which is about
 
01:52:42.750 --> 01:52:42.760 align:start position:0%
$100,000 or less my side of the chamber
 
01:52:44.950 --> 01:52:44.960 align:start position:0%
was unanimously in support of this
 
01:52:47.030 --> 01:52:47.040 align:start position:0%
vision screening program the last two
 
01:52:49.950 --> 01:52:49.960 align:start position:0%
years the other side was split but there
 
01:52:52.550 --> 01:52:52.560 align:start position:0%
was broad support
 
01:52:55.109 --> 01:52:55.119 align:start position:0%
so passing this amendment will remove
 
01:52:57.030 --> 01:52:57.040 align:start position:0%
the question of whether or not it's
 
01:52:58.910 --> 01:52:58.920 align:start position:0%
about Medicaid and attacking social
 
01:53:00.629 --> 01:53:00.639 align:start position:0%
services and attacking health care for
 
01:53:02.589 --> 01:53:02.599 align:start position:0%
the poor and make it purely about what
 
01:53:04.470 --> 01:53:04.480 align:start position:0%
the underlying bill is about
 
01:53:09.149 --> 01:53:09.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:11.470 --> 01:53:11.480 align:start position:0%
amendment the questions on the adoption
 
01:53:15.390 --> 01:53:15.400 align:start position:0%
of floor Amendment 0786 H are you ready
 
01:53:17.830 --> 01:53:17.840 align:start position:0%
for the question all those in favor say
 
01:53:23.470 --> 01:53:23.480 align:start position:0%
I I all those oppose nay no
 
01:53:27.550 --> 01:53:27.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:31.510 --> 01:53:31.520 align:start position:0%
fails now on to the main motion of a to
 
01:53:34.270 --> 01:53:34.280 align:start position:0%
pass representative Nagel is recognized
 
01:53:40.270 --> 01:53:40.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:45.030 --> 01:53:45.040 align:start position:0%
report thank you Mr chairman um I'd like
 
01:53:46.830 --> 01:53:46.840 align:start position:0%
to begin by thanking all the people that
 
01:53:49.790 --> 01:53:49.800 align:start position:0%
were involved in this discussion um
 
01:53:51.990 --> 01:53:52.000 align:start position:0%
multiple stakeholders over hours and
 
01:53:54.390 --> 01:53:54.400 align:start position:0%
hours was both in session and Beyond and
 
01:53:56.310 --> 01:53:56.320 align:start position:0%
it was really interesting and made me
 
01:53:58.790 --> 01:53:58.800 align:start position:0%
think a lot and and um that's an
 
01:54:01.510 --> 01:54:01.520 align:start position:0%
important thing there in lies the actual
 
01:54:03.510 --> 01:54:03.520 align:start position:0%
problem with this bill this is an
 
01:54:06.790 --> 01:54:06.800 align:start position:0%
incredibly complex issue and that's why
 
01:54:09.910 --> 01:54:09.920 align:start position:0%
I can't support the autop pass motion
 
01:54:12.510 --> 01:54:12.520 align:start position:0%
basically what it does is reduces a very
 
01:54:15.669 --> 01:54:15.679 align:start position:0%
complex bioc psychosocial issue to a
 
01:54:18.750 --> 01:54:18.760 align:start position:0%
purely biomedical one that's overly
 
01:54:20.790 --> 01:54:20.800 align:start position:0%
reductionist non-patient centered
 
01:54:22.030 --> 01:54:22.040 align:start position:0%
thinking which is a trend that we're
 
01:54:24.550 --> 01:54:24.560 align:start position:0%
trying to get away from in health care
 
01:54:28.629 --> 01:54:28.639 align:start position:0%
both in medical education and in public
 
01:54:31.830 --> 01:54:31.840 align:start position:0%
policy um I'm going to share an
 
01:54:34.030 --> 01:54:34.040 align:start position:0%
illustrative personal story because this
 
01:54:37.270 --> 01:54:37.280 align:start position:0%
is a really important medical concept no
 
01:54:38.750 --> 01:54:38.760 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to talk to you about myel
 
01:54:41.470 --> 01:54:41.480 align:start position:0%
a lot to me 20 years I raced all over
 
01:54:43.750 --> 01:54:43.760 align:start position:0%
the country and even all over the
 
01:54:46.350 --> 01:54:46.360 align:start position:0%
world it was great I thought I would do
 
01:54:48.750 --> 01:54:48.760 align:start position:0%
it forever then all of the sudden I was
 
01:54:50.990 --> 01:54:51.000 align:start position:0%
training once and I felt my knee pop and
 
01:54:52.950 --> 01:54:52.960 align:start position:0%
I knew I tore a cartilage
 
01:54:55.109 --> 01:54:55.119 align:start position:0%
you know I knew what it was I knew what
 
01:54:56.790 --> 01:54:56.800 align:start position:0%
it was and I went to see my friend who's
 
01:54:58.750 --> 01:54:58.760 align:start position:0%
an orthopedic surgeon and he immediately
 
01:55:01.229 --> 01:55:01.239 align:start position:0%
looked at me and said you need surgery
 
01:55:03.669 --> 01:55:03.679 align:start position:0%
and I looked at him and I said you're
 
01:55:06.830 --> 01:55:06.840 align:start position:0%
treating me as a knee not as a person
 
01:55:08.149 --> 01:55:08.159 align:start position:0%
and I immediately thought of the
 
01:55:10.589 --> 01:55:10.599 align:start position:0%
millions of different biological
 
01:55:12.990 --> 01:55:13.000 align:start position:0%
psychological social functional issues
 
01:55:15.069 --> 01:55:15.079 align:start position:0%
that played a role in me making a
 
01:55:17.910 --> 01:55:17.920 align:start position:0%
complex medical decision I know I don't
 
01:55:19.709 --> 01:55:19.719 align:start position:0%
look like a physical wreck but I also
 
01:55:21.870 --> 01:55:21.880 align:start position:0%
have a herniated disc I also have carpal
 
01:55:23.550 --> 01:55:23.560 align:start position:0%
tunn and both hands and both my knees
 
01:55:26.430 --> 01:55:26.440 align:start position:0%
are bad and I've chosen to not have
 
01:55:28.350 --> 01:55:28.360 align:start position:0%
surgery and I guarantee you most of the
 
01:55:29.750 --> 01:55:29.760 align:start position:0%
people that I race with would have
 
01:55:31.390 --> 01:55:31.400 align:start position:0%
chosen to have surgery and I bet a lot
 
01:55:33.390 --> 01:55:33.400 align:start position:0%
of you out there would have chosen the
 
01:55:35.990 --> 01:55:36.000 align:start position:0%
same what all these things have in
 
01:55:38.270 --> 01:55:38.280 align:start position:0%
common with circumcision is that they
 
01:55:40.950 --> 01:55:40.960 align:start position:0%
are all elective and they all require a
 
01:55:43.510 --> 01:55:43.520 align:start position:0%
whole person patient centered analysis
 
01:55:45.990 --> 01:55:46.000 align:start position:0%
different people make different choices
 
01:55:47.870 --> 01:55:47.880 align:start position:0%
for those who choose surgery interesting
 
01:55:49.790 --> 01:55:49.800 align:start position:0%
Medicaid covers all those elective
 
01:55:49.800 --> 01:55:54.149 align:start position:0%
Medicaid covers all those elective
things

01:55:54.149 --> 01:55:54.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:56.069 --> 01:55:56.079 align:start position:0%
that is I already mentioned that all
 
01:55:58.589 --> 01:55:58.599 align:start position:0%
right so circumcision has been around
 
01:56:01.750 --> 01:56:01.760 align:start position:0%
for a long time um I did my research and
 
01:56:03.910 --> 01:56:03.920 align:start position:0%
the first recorded on one I could come
 
01:56:08.030 --> 01:56:08.040 align:start position:0%
up with was 4,000 years ago um since
 
01:56:10.430 --> 01:56:10.440 align:start position:0%
that time frame there's been billions
 
01:56:12.830 --> 01:56:12.840 align:start position:0%
billions of medic of circumcisions
 
01:56:15.430 --> 01:56:15.440 align:start position:0%
performed on males and I tried to find
 
01:56:17.910 --> 01:56:17.920 align:start position:0%
why there is no unifying reason why
 
01:56:19.790 --> 01:56:19.800 align:start position:0%
every culture has a different reason but
 
01:56:21.470 --> 01:56:21.480 align:start position:0%
in each of these cultures it's really
 
01:56:23.629 --> 01:56:23.639 align:start position:0%
important to them
 
01:56:25.990 --> 01:56:26.000 align:start position:0%
the magnitude of this suggests that we
 
01:56:28.950 --> 01:56:28.960 align:start position:0%
as a people find Value in circumcision
 
01:56:30.470 --> 01:56:30.480 align:start position:0%
for a variety of
 
01:56:33.629 --> 01:56:33.639 align:start position:0%
reasons in the United States 70% of
 
01:56:35.910 --> 01:56:35.920 align:start position:0%
males now are circumcised their
 
01:56:38.109 --> 01:56:38.119 align:start position:0%
satisfaction rate is
 
01:56:41.270 --> 01:56:41.280 align:start position:0%
90% contrast that with uncircumcised
 
01:56:43.510 --> 01:56:43.520 align:start position:0%
males who only have a satisfaction rate
 
01:56:45.350 --> 01:56:45.360 align:start position:0%
of 80% with their status and
 
01:56:48.149 --> 01:56:48.159 align:start position:0%
interestingly one study found that 83%
 
01:56:51.510 --> 01:56:51.520 align:start position:0%
of women prefer a male who's circumcised
 
01:56:54.270 --> 01:56:54.280 align:start position:0%
says nothing about who's attached to the
 
01:56:56.990 --> 01:56:57.000 align:start position:0%
genital but that's what they said one of
 
01:56:58.709 --> 01:56:58.719 align:start position:0%
the things that we do know is that if
 
01:57:00.390 --> 01:57:00.400 align:start position:0%
you're going to have this done the risk
 
01:57:02.790 --> 01:57:02.800 align:start position:0%
benefit ratio favors doing this in the
 
01:57:04.550 --> 01:57:04.560 align:start position:0%
newborn and there's clear evidence for
 
01:57:06.149 --> 01:57:06.159 align:start position:0%
reductions in a variety of things that
 
01:57:09.310 --> 01:57:09.320 align:start position:0%
the previous speaker already alluded to
 
01:57:12.030 --> 01:57:12.040 align:start position:0%
complications happen but they're rare
 
01:57:14.350 --> 01:57:14.360 align:start position:0%
and the severe complications we were
 
01:57:18.550 --> 01:57:18.560 align:start position:0%
told about are extremely rare the other
 
01:57:20.430 --> 01:57:20.440 align:start position:0%
is I'm sorry the minute the baby leaves
 
01:57:23.589 --> 01:57:23.599 align:start position:0%
the newborn Nursery that may explain
 
01:57:26.390 --> 01:57:26.400 align:start position:0%
that when Florida enacted a similar ban
 
01:57:28.189 --> 01:57:28.199 align:start position:0%
they actually found that their Medicaid
 
01:57:30.629 --> 01:57:30.639 align:start position:0%
C cost Rose they did not go down they
 
01:57:32.430 --> 01:57:32.440 align:start position:0%
went up and the reason why is because
 
01:57:34.109 --> 01:57:34.119 align:start position:0%
when you do it later it's dramatically
 
01:57:34.119 --> 01:57:35.030 align:start position:0%
when you do it later it's dramatically
more

01:57:35.030 --> 01:57:35.040 align:start position:0%
more
 
01:57:37.189 --> 01:57:37.199 align:start position:0%
expensive one other thing that I found
 
01:57:39.270 --> 01:57:39.280 align:start position:0%
that was interesting because some people
 
01:57:41.629 --> 01:57:41.639 align:start position:0%
brought the cost issue into this is that
 
01:57:43.109 --> 01:57:43.119 align:start position:0%
um anybody want to guess what the
 
01:57:45.990 --> 01:57:46.000 align:start position:0%
reimbursement to uh an OB or whomever to
 
01:57:49.910 --> 01:57:49.920 align:start position:0%
do a Medicaid circumcision this state is
 
01:57:51.870 --> 01:57:51.880 align:start position:0%
it's $50 it's actually a little less
 
01:57:54.350 --> 01:57:54.360 align:start position:0%
than $50 which is not enough to cover
 
01:57:56.069 --> 01:57:56.079 align:start position:0%
cost and it is most definitely not
 
01:57:58.109 --> 01:57:58.119 align:start position:0%
enough to cover opportunity cost meaning
 
01:57:59.629 --> 01:57:59.639 align:start position:0%
the time that they could spend doing
 
01:58:02.750 --> 01:58:02.760 align:start position:0%
something else with that said the I
 
01:58:04.709 --> 01:58:04.719 align:start position:0%
interviewed a couple OB practices they
 
01:58:06.709 --> 01:58:06.719 align:start position:0%
all said the same thing they said we do
 
01:58:08.510 --> 01:58:08.520 align:start position:0%
it because it's patient choice and we
 
01:58:10.510 --> 01:58:10.520 align:start position:0%
feel obligated to respect the wishes of
 
01:58:10.520 --> 01:58:12.149 align:start position:0%
feel obligated to respect the wishes of
our

01:58:12.149 --> 01:58:12.159 align:start position:0%
our
 
01:58:14.990 --> 01:58:15.000 align:start position:0%
patient concluding circumcision for
 
01:58:17.229 --> 01:58:17.239 align:start position:0%
complicated reasons remains an important
 
01:58:19.109 --> 01:58:19.119 align:start position:0%
part of the American healthc care
 
01:58:22.310 --> 01:58:22.320 align:start position:0%
Paradigm until there's a major paradigm
 
01:58:24.629 --> 01:58:24.639 align:start position:0%
shift third party payment payers such as
 
01:58:26.189 --> 01:58:26.199 align:start position:0%
Medicaid should respect the
 
01:58:28.550 --> 01:58:28.560 align:start position:0%
recommendations the American The Academy
 
01:58:31.069 --> 01:58:31.079 align:start position:0%
of family physicians and cover this
 
01:58:33.069 --> 01:58:33.079 align:start position:0%
procedure and I would recommend at this
 
01:58:35.709 --> 01:58:35.719 align:start position:0%
time until that day happens that we
 
01:58:40.910 --> 01:58:40.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:43.350 --> 01:58:43.360 align:start position:0%
you representative Burch has recognized
 
01:58:54.990 --> 01:58:55.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:58.069 --> 01:58:58.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:00.189 --> 01:59:00.199 align:start position:0%
Speaker okay so let's talk about
 
01:59:03.589 --> 01:59:03.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:06.189 --> 01:59:06.199 align:start position:0%
Medicaid this is a bill designed to
 
01:59:08.750 --> 01:59:08.760 align:start position:0%
remove circumcision from Medicaid
 
01:59:10.069 --> 01:59:10.079 align:start position:0%
coverage in New
 
01:59:12.870 --> 01:59:12.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire circumcision like many
 
01:59:15.790 --> 01:59:15.800 align:start position:0%
procedures covered by Medicaid is
 
01:59:18.950 --> 01:59:18.960 align:start position:0%
considered by the medical profession as
 
01:59:23.310 --> 01:59:23.320 align:start position:0%
beneficial as recommended but not
 
01:59:26.390 --> 01:59:26.400 align:start position:0%
mandatory the professional groups that
 
01:59:28.510 --> 01:59:28.520 align:start position:0%
deal with procedures like
 
01:59:31.149 --> 01:59:31.159 align:start position:0%
circumcision uh are the American Academy
 
01:59:34.550 --> 01:59:34.560 align:start position:0%
of Pediatrics not surprising and the
 
01:59:38.510 --> 01:59:38.520 align:start position:0%
American College of Obstetricians and
 
01:59:41.189 --> 01:59:41.199 align:start position:0%
gynecologists both have issued a policy
 
01:59:44.069 --> 01:59:44.079 align:start position:0%
statement that states that for newborn
 
01:59:46.870 --> 01:59:46.880 align:start position:0%
male circumcision the health
 
01:59:50.589 --> 01:59:50.599 align:start position:0%
benefits outweigh any risks and such
 
01:59:53.470 --> 01:59:53.480 align:start position:0%
benefits include prevention of
 
01:59:57.430 --> 01:59:57.440 align:start position:0%
UTI penile cancer and transmission of
 
02:00:00.430 --> 02:00:00.440 align:start position:0%
some sexually transmitted infections
 
02:00:03.109 --> 02:00:03.119 align:start position:0%
such as HPV and
 
02:00:08.750 --> 02:00:08.760 align:start position:0%
HIV if you want to reduce HPV a very
 
02:00:12.229 --> 02:00:12.239 align:start position:0%
serious disease in our society today
 
02:00:14.990 --> 02:00:15.000 align:start position:0%
that affects women and
 
02:00:18.310 --> 02:00:18.320 align:start position:0%
men support
 
02:00:21.229 --> 02:00:21.239 align:start position:0%
circumcision complications unlike what
 
02:00:24.109 --> 02:00:24.119 align:start position:0%
we may have heard earlier complications
 
02:00:27.430 --> 02:00:27.440 align:start position:0%
are infrequent according to the medical
 
02:00:30.790 --> 02:00:30.800 align:start position:0%
profession usually quite minor and
 
02:00:34.030 --> 02:00:34.040 align:start position:0%
serious complications are very
 
02:00:37.390 --> 02:00:37.400 align:start position:0%
rare in addition to concluding that
 
02:00:40.870 --> 02:00:40.880 align:start position:0%
newborn male circumcision is a medically
 
02:00:40.880 --> 02:00:42.430 align:start position:0%
newborn male circumcision is a medically
beneficial

02:00:42.430 --> 02:00:42.440 align:start position:0%
beneficial
 
02:00:45.510 --> 02:00:45.520 align:start position:0%
procedure the medical Prof profession
 
02:00:47.870 --> 02:00:47.880 align:start position:0%
also says and this is part of what
 
02:00:51.430 --> 02:00:51.440 align:start position:0%
bothies say that third-party payments
 
02:00:53.149 --> 02:00:53.159 align:start position:0%
are War
 
02:00:55.910 --> 02:00:55.920 align:start position:0%
warranted that means
 
02:00:58.990 --> 02:00:59.000 align:start position:0%
Medicaid so
 
02:01:02.830 --> 02:01:02.840 align:start position:0%
question does or should Medicaid cover
 
02:01:07.830 --> 02:01:07.840 align:start position:0%
beneficial recommended but non-mandatory
 
02:01:10.270 --> 02:01:10.280 align:start position:0%
procedures actually it's a significant
 
02:01:13.229 --> 02:01:13.239 align:start position:0%
part of what Medicaid does now we all
 
02:01:15.790 --> 02:01:15.800 align:start position:0%
know that Medicaid is State administered
 
02:01:18.830 --> 02:01:18.840 align:start position:0%
and varies from state to state so let's
 
02:01:21.750 --> 02:01:21.760 align:start position:0%
talk about what New Hampshire covers
 
02:01:25.030 --> 02:01:25.040 align:start position:0%
that that are beneficial but not
 
02:01:27.390 --> 02:01:27.400 align:start position:0%
mandatory like

02:01:59.270 --> 02:01:59.280 align:start position:0%
bariatric surgery I could go on to more
 
02:02:02.629 --> 02:02:02.639 align:start position:0%
so all of these are in the same
 
02:02:04.790 --> 02:02:04.800 align:start position:0%
category as
 
02:02:08.510 --> 02:02:08.520 align:start position:0%
circumcision this bill separates out
 
02:02:10.790 --> 02:02:10.800 align:start position:0%
from all of those kind of
 
02:02:15.430 --> 02:02:15.440 align:start position:0%
programs only one program
 
02:02:17.910 --> 02:02:17.920 align:start position:0%
circumcision so enough of the medical
 
02:02:21.229 --> 02:02:21.239 align:start position:0%
stuff it's a recommended procedure it's
 
02:02:24.750 --> 02:02:24.760 align:start position:0%
a benefit IAL procedure there's no
 
02:02:29.990 --> 02:02:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:33.910 --> 02:02:33.920 align:start position:0%
bill let's also talk about the results
 
02:02:35.589 --> 02:02:35.599 align:start position:0%
if this bill
 
02:02:38.990 --> 02:02:39.000 align:start position:0%
passes we know the circumcisions are
 
02:02:42.310 --> 02:02:42.320 align:start position:0%
performed across the entire spectrum of
 
02:02:43.790 --> 02:02:43.800 align:start position:0%
males in New
 
02:02:47.109 --> 02:02:47.119 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but it's clearly associated
 
02:02:49.510 --> 02:02:49.520 align:start position:0%
with Jewish and Muslim
 
02:02:52.790 --> 02:02:52.800 align:start position:0%
practice I am not arguing and I'll say
 
02:02:57.229 --> 02:02:57.239 align:start position:0%
it again I am not arguing the difference
 
02:03:00.229 --> 02:03:00.239 align:start position:0%
should be paid by the state to the
 
02:03:03.750 --> 02:03:03.760 align:start position:0%
religious or cultural practices of any
 
02:03:07.750 --> 02:03:07.760 align:start position:0%
religion or any group I am not arguing
 
02:03:11.790 --> 02:03:11.800 align:start position:0%
that however I am saying that the
 
02:03:15.069 --> 02:03:15.079 align:start position:0%
passage of this bill that sets
 
02:03:15.079 --> 02:03:16.589 align:start position:0%
passage of this bill that sets
circumcision

02:03:16.589 --> 02:03:16.599 align:start position:0%
circumcision
 
02:03:20.510 --> 02:03:20.520 align:start position:0%
apart from all the other beneficial but
 
02:03:22.470 --> 02:03:22.480 align:start position:0%
not mandatory
 
02:03:25.270 --> 02:03:25.280 align:start position:0%
procedures does send a
 
02:03:28.870 --> 02:03:28.880 align:start position:0%
message it hangs a sign that says Jews
 
02:03:32.750 --> 02:03:32.760 align:start position:0%
and Muslims are not quite as welcome in
 
02:03:32.760 --> 02:03:33.669 align:start position:0%
and Muslims are not quite as welcome in
New

02:03:33.669 --> 02:03:33.679 align:start position:0%
New
 
02:03:37.470 --> 02:03:37.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire as others many will not see
 
02:03:37.480 --> 02:03:38.790 align:start position:0%
Hampshire as others many will not see
that

02:03:38.790 --> 02:03:38.800 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:03:41.350 --> 02:03:41.360 align:start position:0%
sign but you can be sure that Muslims
 
02:03:43.350 --> 02:03:43.360 align:start position:0%
and Jews
 
02:03:45.870 --> 02:03:45.880 align:start position:0%
will the Democratic
 
02:03:48.830 --> 02:03:48.840 align:start position:0%
chair in chesher county is a
 
02:03:52.149 --> 02:03:52.159 align:start position:0%
Muslim we don't usually talk about bills
 
02:03:54.549 --> 02:03:54.559 align:start position:0%
we do some administrative talk and he
 
02:03:59.030 --> 02:03:59.040 align:start position:0%
does his work I do mine on this bill he
 
02:04:00.709 --> 02:04:00.719 align:start position:0%
reached out to me probably the first
 
02:04:04.109 --> 02:04:04.119 align:start position:0%
bill in five years and asked me to do
 
02:04:06.350 --> 02:04:06.360 align:start position:0%
what could be done to have it
 
02:04:09.589 --> 02:04:09.599 align:start position:0%
defeated we don't need to pass this bill
 
02:04:12.310 --> 02:04:12.320 align:start position:0%
it's a minuscule program the
 
02:04:15.750 --> 02:04:15.760 align:start position:0%
reimbursement as we heard is about $50
 
02:04:15.760 --> 02:04:17.470 align:start position:0%
reimbursement as we heard is about $50
per

02:04:17.470 --> 02:04:17.480 align:start position:0%
per
 
02:04:21.229 --> 02:04:21.239 align:start position:0%
claim we should not pass this bill what
 
02:04:24.830 --> 02:04:24.840 align:start position:0%
we need to do is treat our neighbors as
 
02:04:28.229 --> 02:04:28.239 align:start position:0%
we would wish to be they to treat us and
 
02:04:33.629 --> 02:04:33.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:36.109 --> 02:04:36.119 align:start position:0%
you representative sod's recognized to
 
02:04:39.430 --> 02:04:39.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:42.390 --> 02:04:42.400 align:start position:0%
report thank you Mr Speaker I'm G to be
 
02:04:44.470 --> 02:04:44.480 align:start position:0%
brief because I know this is a broad and
 
02:04:46.149 --> 02:04:46.159 align:start position:0%
extensive topic but I'm going to clear
 
02:04:48.189 --> 02:04:48.199 align:start position:0%
up some myths right here right
 
02:04:48.199 --> 02:04:50.629 align:start position:0%
up some myths right here right
now

02:04:50.629 --> 02:04:50.639 align:start position:0%
now
 
02:04:52.990 --> 02:04:53.000 align:start position:0%
oh I want to clear up some myths right
 
02:04:55.830 --> 02:04:55.840 align:start position:0%
here right now of what circumcision is
 
02:04:58.750 --> 02:04:58.760 align:start position:0%
and is not circumcision is when 40 to
 
02:05:01.189 --> 02:05:01.199 align:start position:0%
50% of orogy
 
02:05:03.549 --> 02:05:03.559 align:start position:0%
tissue also known as the foreskin is cut
 
02:05:05.950 --> 02:05:05.960 align:start position:0%
off a baby boy's
 
02:05:09.310 --> 02:05:09.320 align:start position:0%
penis this is medically not necessary it
 
02:05:11.510 --> 02:05:11.520 align:start position:0%
cures exactly
 
02:05:14.229 --> 02:05:14.239 align:start position:0%
nothing this ayous tissue was put there
 
02:05:16.990 --> 02:05:17.000 align:start position:0%
for a reason it is there to protect the
 
02:05:19.510 --> 02:05:19.520 align:start position:0%
head of the penis and it is there to
 
02:05:22.149 --> 02:05:22.159 align:start position:0%
enhance sexual pleasure
 
02:05:24.750 --> 02:05:24.760 align:start position:0%
I and 80% of the male population on the
 
02:05:28.910 --> 02:05:28.920 align:start position:0%
planet who are unaltered and intact can
 
02:05:30.549 --> 02:05:30.559 align:start position:0%
attest to
 
02:05:32.750 --> 02:05:32.760 align:start position:0%
this some of the
 
02:05:36.830 --> 02:05:36.840 align:start position:0%
myths also are that Christianity is
 
02:05:38.669 --> 02:05:38.679 align:start position:0%
adopted circumcision but it has not it
 
02:05:41.990 --> 02:05:42.000 align:start position:0%
is a Jewish religious ceremony it is
 
02:05:43.629 --> 02:05:43.639 align:start position:0%
part of the
 
02:05:46.790 --> 02:05:46.800 align:start position:0%
Covenant M will suspend for minute there
 
02:05:48.950 --> 02:05:48.960 align:start position:0%
should be one person speaking and he's
 
02:05:52.510 --> 02:05:52.520 align:start position:0%
at the well continue yeah
 
02:05:54.430 --> 02:05:54.440 align:start position:0%
it is part of the Jewish Covenant
 
02:05:56.109 --> 02:05:56.119 align:start position:0%
Abraham was supposed to
 
02:05:57.830 --> 02:05:57.840 align:start position:0%
sacrifice his
 
02:06:00.229 --> 02:06:00.239 align:start position:0%
son but in the last
 
02:06:04.270 --> 02:06:04.280 align:start position:0%
minute God said no instead we'll
 
02:06:06.270 --> 02:06:06.280 align:start position:0%
sacrifice some sexual pleasure to bring
 
02:06:08.390 --> 02:06:08.400 align:start position:0%
him closer to God by
 
02:06:10.669 --> 02:06:10.679 align:start position:0%
cutting the
 
02:06:13.510 --> 02:06:13.520 align:start position:0%
penis Christianity never or rather
 
02:06:16.189 --> 02:06:16.199 align:start position:0%
Muslims also have this as part of their
 
02:06:19.750 --> 02:06:19.760 align:start position:0%
tradition but they do not uh their time
 
02:06:22.149 --> 02:06:22.159 align:start position:0%
intervals vary when they do it
 
02:06:25.350 --> 02:06:25.360 align:start position:0%
Christians do not St Paul made it very
 
02:06:26.830 --> 02:06:26.840 align:start position:0%
clear in the first century that
 
02:06:29.189 --> 02:06:29.199 align:start position:0%
circumcision would not be part of
 
02:06:31.189 --> 02:06:31.199 align:start position:0%
Christianity probably a great marketing
 
02:06:33.149 --> 02:06:33.159 align:start position:0%
move because I don't think come to Jesus
 
02:06:34.750 --> 02:06:34.760 align:start position:0%
cut a piece of your penis off would have
 
02:06:36.350 --> 02:06:36.360 align:start position:0%
been a big
 
02:06:38.669 --> 02:06:38.679 align:start position:0%
seller the next myth is that oh it's a
 
02:06:41.870 --> 02:06:41.880 align:start position:0%
good old American tradition it is not
 
02:06:43.390 --> 02:06:43.400 align:start position:0%
the men pictured on the wall behind me
 
02:06:47.149 --> 02:06:47.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:49.990 --> 02:06:50.000 align:start position:0%
circumcised because because the house
 
02:06:52.629 --> 02:06:52.639 align:start position:0%
will be in order
 
02:06:55.830 --> 02:06:55.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:59.430 --> 02:06:59.440 align:start position:0%
it yes we do and that's not at the
 
02:07:02.950 --> 02:07:02.960 align:start position:0%
current Speaker I'm just I'm the whole
 
02:07:05.589 --> 02:07:05.599 align:start position:0%
thing continue please and let whole
 
02:07:11.790 --> 02:07:11.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:14.229 --> 02:07:14.239 align:start position:0%
just circumcision didn't become a thing
 
02:07:16.990 --> 02:07:17.000 align:start position:0%
in the US until the late
 
02:07:20.390 --> 02:07:20.400 align:start position:0%
1800s and didn't and it peaked in 1970
 
02:07:23.109 --> 02:07:23.119 align:start position:0%
and it's been on the decline ever since
 
02:07:25.149 --> 02:07:25.159 align:start position:0%
it was in the late 1800s when the
 
02:07:27.950 --> 02:07:27.960 align:start position:0%
medicine was more snake oil than
 
02:07:30.510 --> 02:07:30.520 align:start position:0%
science circumcision was promoted as a
 
02:07:32.629 --> 02:07:32.639 align:start position:0%
Wonder cure for everything and we're
 
02:07:35.109 --> 02:07:35.119 align:start position:0%
still wondering what it's curing because
 
02:07:39.870 --> 02:07:39.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:42.870 --> 02:07:42.880 align:start position:0%
debunked it was the it was during this
 
02:07:45.629 --> 02:07:45.639 align:start position:0%
time that it was promoted by puritanical
 
02:07:48.350 --> 02:07:48.360 align:start position:0%
prudish quacks who saw sex as the root
 
02:07:51.109 --> 02:07:51.119 align:start position:0%
of all evil circumcision was meant to be
 
02:07:51.119 --> 02:07:52.069 align:start position:0%
of all evil circumcision was meant to be
painful

02:07:52.069 --> 02:07:52.079 align:start position:0%
painful
 
02:07:55.870 --> 02:07:55.880 align:start position:0%
and it is and it was meant to diminish
 
02:07:58.510 --> 02:07:58.520 align:start position:0%
sexual pleasure by cutting off
 
02:08:00.990 --> 02:08:01.000 align:start position:0%
aerogenous tissue they also had some
 
02:08:02.790 --> 02:08:02.800 align:start position:0%
versions for women which included some
 
02:08:04.830 --> 02:08:04.840 align:start position:0%
sort of acids as well but luckily for
 
02:08:06.870 --> 02:08:06.880 align:start position:0%
women that never caught
 
02:08:10.229 --> 02:08:10.239 align:start position:0%
on which brings us to this bill and
 
02:08:13.350 --> 02:08:13.360 align:start position:0%
where I would ask the house today why we
 
02:08:17.030 --> 02:08:17.040 align:start position:0%
the state are paying to diminish sexual
 
02:08:19.990 --> 02:08:20.000 align:start position:0%
pleasure of poor
 
02:08:23.270 --> 02:08:23.280 align:start position:0%
people I'll finish there I will answer
 
02:08:31.589 --> 02:08:31.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:34.390 --> 02:08:34.400 align:start position:0%
skin does the member yield for a
 
02:08:34.400 --> 02:08:35.669 align:start position:0%
skin does the member yield for a
question

02:08:35.669 --> 02:08:35.679 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:08:38.709 --> 02:08:38.719 align:start position:0%
absolutely oh dear lord representative
 
02:08:40.950 --> 02:08:40.960 align:start position:0%
wheeler you may
 
02:08:44.030 --> 02:08:44.040 align:start position:0%
inquire you know there's a lot of times
 
02:08:45.790 --> 02:08:45.800 align:start position:0%
in this body where I feel like I'm in
 
02:08:48.589 --> 02:08:48.599 align:start position:0%
high school but none more than when the
 
02:08:50.669 --> 02:08:50.679 align:start position:0%
entire body laughs laughs laughs at
 
02:08:52.950 --> 02:08:52.960 align:start position:0%
every time the word penis is mentioned
 
02:08:56.229 --> 02:08:56.239 align:start position:0%
but that's okay thank you representative
 
02:08:58.790 --> 02:08:58.800 align:start position:0%
for taking my question I was just
 
02:09:01.069 --> 02:09:01.079 align:start position:0%
looking into history I love history very
 
02:09:03.390 --> 02:09:03.400 align:start position:0%
you know I like to be uh as well
 
02:09:06.549 --> 02:09:06.559 align:start position:0%
informed as I can on these issues and I
 
02:09:09.790 --> 02:09:09.800 align:start position:0%
found a doctor from San Diego who was
 
02:09:12.589 --> 02:09:12.599 align:start position:0%
cited in many medical journals including
 
02:09:15.229 --> 02:09:15.239 align:start position:0%
Boston's and Maryland's and others his
 
02:09:17.470 --> 02:09:17.480 align:start position:0%
name is Peter ramundo and would you
 
02:09:21.510 --> 02:09:21.520 align:start position:0%
believe representative that in his
 
02:09:25.069 --> 02:09:25.079 align:start position:0%
medical journal written in 1894 that was
 
02:09:29.790 --> 02:09:29.800 align:start position:0%
used for quite a long time he cited
 
02:09:32.229 --> 02:09:32.239 align:start position:0%
circumcision and its benefits one of
 
02:09:35.390 --> 02:09:35.400 align:start position:0%
them being from our observations and
 
02:09:38.189 --> 02:09:38.199 align:start position:0%
experiences in such case we feel fully
 
02:09:40.830 --> 02:09:40.840 align:start position:0%
warranted in suggesting the wholesale
 
02:09:44.510 --> 02:09:44.520 align:start position:0%
circumcision of the Negro waste so as an
 
02:09:46.589 --> 02:09:46.599 align:start position:0%
efficient remedy in preventing the
 
02:09:49.990 --> 02:09:50.000 align:start position:0%
predisposition to discriminate
 
02:09:52.470 --> 02:09:52.480 align:start position:0%
raping they want wanted to use
 
02:09:55.589 --> 02:09:55.599 align:start position:0%
circumcision as a way to circumcise the
 
02:09:58.870 --> 02:09:58.880 align:start position:0%
entire negro race to prevent them from
 
02:10:00.510 --> 02:10:00.520 align:start position:0%
raping white women would you believe
 
02:10:02.430 --> 02:10:02.440 align:start position:0%
that that was the justification used for
 
02:10:03.990 --> 02:10:04.000 align:start position:0%
circumcision yes I would he was one of
 
02:10:05.229 --> 02:10:05.239 align:start position:0%
the quacks that was promoting
 
02:10:07.750 --> 02:10:07.760 align:start position:0%
circumcision back in the late
 
02:10:13.350 --> 02:10:13.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:15.709 --> 02:10:15.719 align:start position:0%
journal there were more than that to
 
02:10:17.830 --> 02:10:17.840 align:start position:0%
representative gringer has requested a
 
02:10:21.629 --> 02:10:21.639 align:start position:0%
roll call as that sufficiently seconded
 
02:10:23.629 --> 02:10:23.639 align:start position:0%
no more questions more question it is

sufficiently seconded this will be a
 
02:10:50.229 --> 02:10:50.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:25.589 --> 02:11:25.599 align:start position:0%

committee report about to pass on House
 
02:11:29.840 --> 02:11:32.069 align:start position:0%
committee report about to pass on House
Bill

02:11:32.069 --> 02:11:32.079 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
02:11:34.990 --> 02:11:35.000 align:start position:0%
94 representative Burch is recognized
 
02:11:44.669 --> 02:11:44.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:53.790 --> 02:11:53.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:55.030 --> 02:11:55.040 align:start position:0%
if I
 
02:11:57.390 --> 02:11:57.400 align:start position:0%
know that according to the American
 
02:12:00.030 --> 02:12:00.040 align:start position:0%
Academy of Pediatrics and the American
 
02:12:03.629 --> 02:12:03.639 align:start position:0%
College of Obstetricians and
 
02:12:05.950 --> 02:12:05.960 align:start position:0%
gynecologists that circumcision is
 
02:12:08.750 --> 02:12:08.760 align:start position:0%
beneficial surgery and that its health
 
02:12:11.709 --> 02:12:11.719 align:start position:0%
benefits outweigh its risks in that it
 
02:12:13.229 --> 02:12:13.239 align:start position:0%
helps prevent
 
02:12:17.109 --> 02:12:17.119 align:start position:0%
UTI penile cancer and transmission of
 
02:12:19.990 --> 02:12:20.000 align:start position:0%
sexually transmitted infections such as
 
02:12:20.000 --> 02:12:21.589 align:start position:0%
sexually transmitted infections such as
HPV

02:12:21.589 --> 02:12:21.599 align:start position:0%
HPV
 
02:12:21.599 --> 02:12:22.750 align:start position:0%
HPV
and

02:12:22.750 --> 02:12:22.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:12:26.870 --> 02:12:26.880 align:start position:0%
HIV and the complications are infrequent
 
02:12:29.510 --> 02:12:29.520 align:start position:0%
generally very
 
02:12:32.350 --> 02:12:32.360 align:start position:0%
minor and if I know that Medicaid in New
 
02:12:36.030 --> 02:12:36.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and elsewhere every day pays
 
02:12:40.350 --> 02:12:40.360 align:start position:0%
for many beneficial but not mandatory
 
02:12:42.430 --> 02:12:42.440 align:start position:0%
procedures and that the payment for
 
02:12:45.510 --> 02:12:45.520 align:start position:0%
Medicaid from Medicaid for circumcision
 
02:12:48.030 --> 02:12:48.040 align:start position:0%
is approximately
 
02:12:50.549 --> 02:12:50.559 align:start position:0%
$50 and if I know that the medical
 
02:12:52.830 --> 02:12:52.840 align:start position:0%
profession supports third-party payments
 
02:12:56.870 --> 02:12:56.880 align:start position:0%
for circumcision because of its medical
 
02:13:01.510 --> 02:13:01.520 align:start position:0%
benefits and finally if I believe that
 
02:13:04.750 --> 02:13:04.760 align:start position:0%
the passage of this bill will make Jews
 
02:13:06.830 --> 02:13:06.840 align:start position:0%
and Muslims feel less welcome in the
 
02:13:09.870 --> 02:13:09.880 align:start position:0%
granted state would I press the red
 
02:13:13.870 --> 02:13:13.880 align:start position:0%
button to vote against the OTP so that
 
02:13:17.069 --> 02:13:17.079 align:start position:0%
another motion can be made thank you Mr
 
02:13:18.870 --> 02:13:18.880 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr
 
02:13:21.109 --> 02:13:21.119 align:start position:0%
Speaker representative McFarland's
 
02:13:25.189 --> 02:13:25.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:27.430 --> 02:13:27.440 align:start position:0%
inquiry thank you Mr
 
02:13:31.470 --> 02:13:31.480 align:start position:0%
Speaker Mr Speaker if I know that we
 
02:13:33.790 --> 02:13:33.800 align:start position:0%
rightly condemn female genital
 
02:13:37.310 --> 02:13:37.320 align:start position:0%
mutilation as abhorent yet some of my
 
02:13:39.990 --> 02:13:40.000 align:start position:0%
honorable colleagues would force
 
02:13:42.950 --> 02:13:42.960 align:start position:0%
taxpayers to fund genital cutting when
 
02:13:44.589 --> 02:13:44.599 align:start position:0%
it happens to
 
02:13:48.589 --> 02:13:48.599 align:start position:0%
boys and if I know that this bill does
 
02:13:53.470 --> 02:13:53.480 align:start position:0%
not ban circum ision but simply says
 
02:13:54.990 --> 02:13:55.000 align:start position:0%
that the government should keep its
 
02:13:58.229 --> 02:13:58.239 align:start position:0%
hands off where they don't
 
02:14:00.870 --> 02:14:00.880 align:start position:0%
belong and if I
 
02:14:04.870 --> 02:14:04.880 align:start position:0%
know that routine circumcision has no
 
02:14:04.880 --> 02:14:05.990 align:start position:0%
know that routine circumcision has no
medical

02:14:05.990 --> 02:14:06.000 align:start position:0%
medical
 
02:14:08.270 --> 02:14:08.280 align:start position:0%
justification and that countries which
 
02:14:11.589 --> 02:14:11.599 align:start position:0%
don't routinely circumcise have lower
 
02:14:13.870 --> 02:14:13.880 align:start position:0%
rates of these
 
02:14:16.149 --> 02:14:16.159 align:start position:0%
infrequent as the member from West
 
02:14:19.069 --> 02:14:19.079 align:start position:0%
Millan puts it infections and
 
02:14:21.669 --> 02:14:21.679 align:start position:0%
complications than we do
 
02:14:24.950 --> 02:14:24.960 align:start position:0%
and if I know that we Americans can and
 
02:14:29.589 --> 02:14:29.599 align:start position:0%
should make female orgasms greater
 
02:14:32.950 --> 02:14:32.960 align:start position:0%
again and finally Mr Speaker if I know
 
02:14:35.109 --> 02:14:35.119 align:start position:0%
that taxation is theft then would I now
 
02:14:38.030 --> 02:14:38.040 align:start position:0%
vote to cut unnecessary spending in the
 
02:14:47.910 --> 02:14:47.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:52.950 --> 02:14:52.960 align:start position:0%
button the house will be in
 
02:14:55.709 --> 02:14:55.719 align:start position:0%
order cooperate I'm standing between you
 
02:14:59.669 --> 02:14:59.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:01.589 --> 02:15:01.599 align:start position:0%
comfortable the question is on the
 
02:15:03.390 --> 02:15:03.400 align:start position:0%
majority committee report about about to
 
02:15:06.470 --> 02:15:06.480 align:start position:0%
pass on House Bill 94 and this is a roll
 
02:15:08.549 --> 02:15:08.559 align:start position:0%
call vote if you're in favor press the
 
02:15:10.470 --> 02:15:10.480 align:start position:0%
green button oppose press the red voting
 
02:15:19.950 --> 02:15:19.960 align:start position:0%

02:16:43.669 --> 02:16:43.679 align:start position:0%
have all members present had an

represents half of our state's 26

that proposed new healthc care

of our critical access hospitals and

03:27:28.590 --> 03:27:28.600 align:start position:0%

the 15 Mile limit for almost all types
 
03:27:33.910 --> 03:27:33.920 align:start position:0%

unchecked development of new healthc
 
03:27:38.389 --> 03:27:38.399 align:start position:0%

03:27:40.990 --> 03:27:41.000 align:start position:0%
cherry-pick the more profitable patients

03:27:48.110 --> 03:27:48.120 align:start position:0%
this will directly undermine the

report thank you Mr
 
03:28:42.070 --> 03:28:42.080 align:start position:0%
Speaker Mr Speaker HB 223 is a bill that
 
03:28:44.550 --> 03:28:44.560 align:start position:0%
attempts to begin the process of opening
 
03:28:46.110 --> 03:28:46.120 align:start position:0%
up the HealthCare Marketplace in the
 
03:28:48.349 --> 03:28:48.359 align:start position:0%
rural areas of the state to new
 
03:28:50.750 --> 03:28:50.760 align:start position:0%
approaches and providers to try to
 
03:28:53.429 --> 03:28:53.439 align:start position:0%
counter the ongoing trend of declining
 
03:28:56.510 --> 03:28:56.520 align:start position:0%
access in those communities all around
 
03:28:58.750 --> 03:28:58.760 align:start position:0%
us we can see ongoing evidence that
 
03:29:00.950 --> 03:29:00.960 align:start position:0%
services in the rural areas of this
 
03:29:03.030 --> 03:29:03.040 align:start position:0%
state are going away without being
 
03:29:05.070 --> 03:29:05.080 align:start position:0%
backfilled some quick examples in
 
03:29:07.790 --> 03:29:07.800 align:start position:0%
October 2020 both Franklin hospital and
 
03:29:10.110 --> 03:29:10.120 align:start position:0%
Lakes Region Hospital filed for chapter
 
03:29:12.830 --> 03:29:12.840 align:start position:0%
11 bankruptcy and had to be zorbed in
 
03:29:15.790 --> 03:29:15.800 align:start position:0%
conquered Hospital in order to survive
 
03:29:18.990 --> 03:29:19.000 align:start position:0%
in 2023 frisbee Memorial hospital closed
 
03:29:21.150 --> 03:29:21.160 align:start position:0%
its labor and delivery services and that
 
03:29:23.429 --> 03:29:23.439 align:start position:0%
was the 11th Maternity Ward closure in
 
03:29:26.750 --> 03:29:26.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire in the past 20 years in
 
03:29:29.429 --> 03:29:29.439 align:start position:0%
2024 exitor Hospital proposed cuts to

neurology Pediatric Dental Advanced life
 
03:29:34.990 --> 03:29:35.000 align:start position:0%
support Podiatry and Immunology and they
 
03:29:37.030 --> 03:29:37.040 align:start position:0%
were only suspended because the Attorney
 
03:29:39.710 --> 03:29:39.720 align:start position:0%
General got involved and on top of all
 
03:29:43.429 --> 03:29:43.439 align:start position:0%
this New Hampshire as a whole has not
 
03:29:46.790 --> 03:29:46.800 align:start position:0%
added a new hospital in 40 years years
 
03:29:49.110 --> 03:29:49.120 align:start position:0%
in spite of the fact that over
 
03:29:52.110 --> 03:29:52.120 align:start position:0%
450,000 new residents have come into the
 
03:29:55.110 --> 03:29:55.120 align:start position:0%
state over that period of time part of
 
03:29:57.429 --> 03:29:57.439 align:start position:0%
the problem is that we have fallen back
 
03:29:59.590 --> 03:29:59.600 align:start position:0%
into a position where we are now relying
 
03:30:02.110 --> 03:30:02.120 align:start position:0%
on the state's critical access hospitals
 
03:30:04.750 --> 03:30:04.760 align:start position:0%
as the almost exclusive provider of
 
03:30:07.070 --> 03:30:07.080 align:start position:0%
non-primary Health Care in the rural
 
03:30:09.389 --> 03:30:09.399 align:start position:0%
areas of this state and that would be
 
03:30:11.710 --> 03:30:11.720 align:start position:0%
fine except that these hospitals are at
 
03:30:13.990 --> 03:30:14.000 align:start position:0%
a Breaking Point and the current law
 
03:30:16.110 --> 03:30:16.120 align:start position:0%
throws up heavy barriers to exploring
 
03:30:16.120 --> 03:30:17.269 align:start position:0%
throws up heavy barriers to exploring
any

03:30:17.269 --> 03:30:17.279 align:start position:0%
any
 
03:30:20.389 --> 03:30:20.399 align:start position:0%
alternatives one of the barriers that
 
03:30:23.150 --> 03:30:23.160 align:start position:0%
this bill seeks to tear down is the 15m
 
03:30:25.150 --> 03:30:25.160 align:start position:0%
radial exclusion Zone around critical
 
03:30:28.349 --> 03:30:28.359 align:start position:0%
access hospitals the bill gets rid of it
 
03:30:30.950 --> 03:30:30.960 align:start position:0%
right now no healthc care facility can
 
03:30:32.870 --> 03:30:32.880 align:start position:0%
get approval to build a facility in an
 
03:30:35.030 --> 03:30:35.040 align:start position:0%
exclusion Zone without first getting the
 
03:30:37.189 --> 03:30:37.199 align:start position:0%
approval of the impacted critical access
 
03:30:39.550 --> 03:30:39.560 align:start position:0%
hospital but as you can imagine that
 
03:30:43.150 --> 03:30:43.160 align:start position:0%
approval is hard to get as hospitals are
 
03:30:45.750 --> 03:30:45.760 align:start position:0%
very eager to maintain their exclusivity
 
03:30:48.950 --> 03:30:48.960 align:start position:0%
in any given area former HHS
 
03:30:51.469 --> 03:30:51.479 align:start position:0%
commissioner Nick veas who supports this
 
03:30:53.510 --> 03:30:53.520 align:start position:0%
bill and came in to testify on its
 
03:30:56.790 --> 03:30:56.800 align:start position:0%
behalf he testified in committee that
 
03:30:58.429 --> 03:30:58.439 align:start position:0%
when he was on the old certificate of
 
03:31:00.550 --> 03:31:00.560 align:start position:0%
need board he would watch Hospital
 
03:31:03.389 --> 03:31:03.399 align:start position:0%
presidents come in and flat out lie in
 
03:31:06.269 --> 03:31:06.279 align:start position:0%
order to protect their Turf so you might
 
03:31:09.670 --> 03:31:09.680 align:start position:0%
say a 15mi radius is no big deal right
 
03:31:12.389 --> 03:31:12.399 align:start position:0%
just built outside it right but the
 
03:31:14.630 --> 03:31:14.640 align:start position:0%
problem is when you overlay all the
 
03:31:17.389 --> 03:31:17.399 align:start position:0%
exclusion zones on on a map the only
 
03:31:20.110 --> 03:31:20.120 align:start position:0%
area outside of the those zones is in
 
03:31:22.670 --> 03:31:22.680 align:start position:0%
the extreme Southeastern portion of the
 
03:31:24.950 --> 03:31:24.960 align:start position:0%
state that's why you can have a
 
03:31:27.990 --> 03:31:28.000 align:start position:0%
convenient MD in Manchester or Salem but
 
03:31:31.309 --> 03:31:31.319 align:start position:0%
not in the state's rural areas HB 223
 
03:31:33.550 --> 03:31:33.560 align:start position:0%
solves the problem by eliminating the
 
03:31:36.150 --> 03:31:36.160 align:start position:0%
exclusion zones so that other facilities
 
03:31:38.630 --> 03:31:38.640 align:start position:0%
might explore Alternatives that might
 
03:31:42.110 --> 03:31:42.120 align:start position:0%
collectively build towards a sustainable
 
03:31:44.429 --> 03:31:44.439 align:start position:0%
model and you know we just heard some
 
03:31:46.750 --> 03:31:46.760 align:start position:0%
say that if this bill pass it's going to
 
03:31:48.990 --> 03:31:49.000 align:start position:0%
wipe out critical access hospitals but
 
03:31:51.469 --> 03:31:51.479 align:start position:0%
the reality is that the rural areas of
 
03:31:53.910 --> 03:31:53.920 align:start position:0%
the state just don't have the population
 
03:31:56.950 --> 03:31:56.960 align:start position:0%
to make a widespread business model
 
03:31:59.070 --> 03:31:59.080 align:start position:0%
business case for widespread clinical
 
03:32:01.870 --> 03:32:01.880 align:start position:0%
expansion the real threat to our
 
03:32:05.150 --> 03:32:05.160 align:start position:0%
critical access hospitals is time the
 
03:32:07.990 --> 03:32:08.000 align:start position:0%
existing model is not sustainable and if
 
03:32:10.590 --> 03:32:10.600 align:start position:0%
we do nothing rural access will be wiped
 
03:32:14.030 --> 03:32:14.040 align:start position:0%
out by nothing more than the passage of
 
03:32:14.040 --> 03:32:15.950 align:start position:0%
out by nothing more than the passage of
time

03:32:15.950 --> 03:32:15.960 align:start position:0%
time
 
03:32:18.550 --> 03:32:18.560 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker it's better to take a small
 
03:32:21.469 --> 03:32:21.479 align:start position:0%
risk now than a huge risk in the midst
 
03:32:24.670 --> 03:32:24.680 align:start position:0%
of a full-on crisis in the future this
 
03:32:26.550 --> 03:32:26.560 align:start position:0%
bill does make one exception to the
 
03:32:28.790 --> 03:32:28.800 align:start position:0%
repeal of the exclusion zones so while
 
03:32:31.229 --> 03:32:31.239 align:start position:0%
the repeal allows for ambulatory
 
03:32:33.070 --> 03:32:33.080 align:start position:0%
surgical centers dialysis centers
 
03:32:35.670 --> 03:32:35.680 align:start position:0%
birthing centers and others to be exempt
 
03:32:38.309 --> 03:32:38.319 align:start position:0%
from the exclusion Zone Provisions it
 
03:32:41.870 --> 03:32:41.880 align:start position:0%
maintains the prohibition on building
 
03:32:44.990 --> 03:32:45.000 align:start position:0%
another hospital in the critical access
 
03:32:46.630 --> 03:32:46.640 align:start position:0%
exclusion Zone and the reason that it
 
03:32:50.429 --> 03:32:50.439 align:start position:0%
does that is the bill took great care to
 
03:32:53.229 --> 03:32:53.239 align:start position:0%
preserve the critical the federal
 
03:32:55.790 --> 03:32:55.800 align:start position:0%
critical access status of our critical
 
03:32:58.030 --> 03:32:58.040 align:start position:0%
access hospitals so that even with this
 
03:33:00.550 --> 03:33:00.560 align:start position:0%
bill they can maintain their favorable
 
03:33:02.910 --> 03:33:02.920 align:start position:0%
Medicare reimbursement rates so I think
 
03:33:05.349 --> 03:33:05.359 align:start position:0%
this bill is a reasonable compromise and
 
03:33:07.189 --> 03:33:07.199 align:start position:0%
I hope you will support it thank you Mr
 
03:33:07.199 --> 03:33:09.070 align:start position:0%

inquiry thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker
 
03:39:10.590 --> 03:39:10.600 align:start position:0%
if I know that the New Hampshire vaccine
 
03:39:13.790 --> 03:39:13.800 align:start position:0%
Association is a very popular program
 
03:39:16.150 --> 03:39:16.160 align:start position:0%
that reduces costs by
 
03:39:20.309 --> 03:39:20.319 align:start position:0%
30% increases efficiency and increases
 
03:39:24.189 --> 03:39:24.199 align:start position:0%
access for those who want vaccines
 
03:39:27.510 --> 03:39:27.520 align:start position:0%
without coercing anybody else to have
 
03:39:30.110 --> 03:39:30.120 align:start position:0%
them and if I know that it is therefore
 
03:39:33.269 --> 03:39:33.279 align:start position:0%
a very parent friendly bill because
 
03:39:36.389 --> 03:39:36.399 align:start position:0%
program because it allows parents to
 
03:39:39.030 --> 03:39:39.040 align:start position:0%
choose exactly what kind of treatments
 
03:39:40.870 --> 03:39:40.880 align:start position:0%
they want for their
 
03:39:43.990 --> 03:39:44.000 align:start position:0%
children would I now vote to table this
 
03:39:46.070 --> 03:39:46.080 align:start position:0%
bill so we can go on to a more
 
03:39:46.080 --> 03:39:48.510 align:start position:0%
bill so we can go on to a more
productive

03:39:48.510 --> 03:39:48.520 align:start position:0%
productive
 
03:39:51.070 --> 03:39:51.080 align:start position:0%

03:39:55.510 --> 03:39:55.520 align:start position:0%
inquiry thank you Mr
 
03:39:59.229 --> 03:39:59.239 align:start position:0%
Speaker if I know that taxpayers deserve
 
03:40:01.429 --> 03:40:01.439 align:start position:0%
answers as to why the New Hampshire
 
03:40:03.429 --> 03:40:03.439 align:start position:0%
vaccine Association has repeatedly
 
03:40:05.389 --> 03:40:05.399 align:start position:0%
refused to reimburse the state for the
 
03:40:08.030 --> 03:40:08.040 align:start position:0%
nearly $1 million annual cost of our
 
03:40:08.040 --> 03:40:09.630 align:start position:0%
nearly $1 million annual cost of our
vaccine

03:40:09.630 --> 03:40:09.640 align:start position:0%
vaccine
 
03:40:11.630 --> 03:40:11.640 align:start position:0%
program and if I know that the false
 
03:40:13.910 --> 03:40:13.920 align:start position:0%
claims again about this
 
03:40:16.189 --> 03:40:16.199 align:start position:0%
bill that this bill would negatively
 
03:40:18.630 --> 03:40:18.640 align:start position:0%
impact New Hampshire families deserve a
 
03:40:20.550 --> 03:40:20.560 align:start position:0%
response on this house floor so that we
 
03:40:23.469 --> 03:40:23.479 align:start position:0%
can decide this bill on its
 
03:40:25.990 --> 03:40:26.000 align:start position:0%
merits and finally Mr Speaker if I know
 
03:40:27.070 --> 03:40:27.080 align:start position:0%
that the New Hampshire vaccine
 
03:40:28.910 --> 03:40:28.920 align:start position:0%
Association suffers from a disturbing
 
03:40:31.790 --> 03:40:31.800 align:start position:0%
lack of transparency and accountability
 
03:40:33.870 --> 03:40:33.880 align:start position:0%
and that tabling this bill would obscure
 
03:40:36.429 --> 03:40:36.439 align:start position:0%
the issue even further by preventing
 
03:40:39.150 --> 03:40:39.160 align:start position:0%
debate would I then press the red button
 
03:40:41.389 --> 03:40:41.399 align:start position:0%

03:42:12.830 --> 03:42:12.840 align:start position:0%
Speaker I Rise Against the UT to pass
 
03:42:15.990 --> 03:42:16.000 align:start position:0%
motion on HB 524
 
03:42:17.469 --> 03:42:17.479 align:start position:0%
which would repeal the New Hampshire
 
03:42:17.479 --> 03:42:18.790 align:start position:0%
which would repeal the New Hampshire
vaccine

03:42:18.790 --> 03:42:18.800 align:start position:0%
vaccine
 
03:42:20.910 --> 03:42:20.920 align:start position:0%
Association the association is a
 
03:42:23.429 --> 03:42:23.439 align:start position:0%
nonprofit organization established
 
03:42:26.870 --> 03:42:26.880 align:start position:0%
decades ago to save money and ensure
 
03:42:30.309 --> 03:42:30.319 align:start position:0%
every child has access to
 
03:42:32.870 --> 03:42:32.880 align:start position:0%
vaccines it is a great example of a
 
03:42:35.110 --> 03:42:35.120 align:start position:0%
public and private partnership that
 
03:42:39.590 --> 03:42:39.600 align:start position:0%
works well it combines money from 90
 
03:42:42.349 --> 03:42:42.359 align:start position:0%
commercial insurers with Federal
 
03:42:45.269 --> 03:42:45.279 align:start position:0%
vaccines for children funds to
 
03:42:48.070 --> 03:42:48.080 align:start position:0%
seamlessly purchase and distribute
 
03:42:51.269 --> 03:42:51.279 align:start position:0%
vaccines across the state to more than
 
03:42:53.550 --> 03:42:53.560 align:start position:0%
200 Pediatric and
 
03:42:57.990 --> 03:42:58.000 align:start position:0%
family practices it is not a tax as some
 
03:43:00.630 --> 03:43:00.640 align:start position:0%
has suggested it is more like a
 
03:43:03.830 --> 03:43:03.840 align:start position:0%
voluntary Buying Club that reduces the
 
03:43:08.469 --> 03:43:08.479 align:start position:0%
cost of vaccines for Everyone by
 
03:43:11.910 --> 03:43:11.920 align:start position:0%
30% it decreases overhead for private
 
03:43:13.269 --> 03:43:13.279 align:start position:0%
practices so they don't have to
 
03:43:15.110 --> 03:43:15.120 align:start position:0%
carefully maintain their own inventory
 
03:43:18.349 --> 03:43:18.359 align:start position:0%
vories nor directly Bill insurers for
 
03:43:18.359 --> 03:43:19.429 align:start position:0%
vories nor directly Bill insurers for
every

03:43:19.429 --> 03:43:19.439 align:start position:0%
every
 
03:43:22.710 --> 03:43:22.720 align:start position:0%
shot it ensures that every child who
 
03:43:25.790 --> 03:43:25.800 align:start position:0%
enters the doctor's office or clinic can
 
03:43:28.870 --> 03:43:28.880 align:start position:0%
get the recommended vaccines at no
 
03:43:32.630 --> 03:43:32.640 align:start position:0%
cost there is no evidence that there is
 
03:43:36.110 --> 03:43:36.120 align:start position:0%
any fraud at the New Hampshire vaccine
 
03:43:40.110 --> 03:43:40.120 align:start position:0%
Association not a single insurer nor
 
03:43:40.120 --> 03:43:41.269 align:start position:0%
Association not a single insurer nor
medical

03:43:41.269 --> 03:43:41.279 align:start position:0%
medical
 
03:43:44.469 --> 03:43:44.479 align:start position:0%
provider spoke in favor of its repeal
 
03:43:47.469 --> 03:43:47.479 align:start position:0%
and in fact they staunchly defended the
 
03:43:50.670 --> 03:43:50.680 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire vaccine
 
03:43:54.950 --> 03:43:54.960 align:start position:0%
Association DHHS opposes this bill it
 
03:43:58.429 --> 03:43:58.439 align:start position:0%
does not cost the state
 
03:44:01.590 --> 03:44:01.600 align:start position:0%
anything in fact if it's repealed it
 
03:44:04.510 --> 03:44:04.520 align:start position:0%
will cost the state money because DHHS
 
03:44:06.790 --> 03:44:06.800 align:start position:0%
will then have to maintain an inventory
 
03:44:10.189 --> 03:44:10.199 align:start position:0%
of vaccines to maintain in case of an
 
03:44:13.229 --> 03:44:13.239 align:start position:0%
outbreak the system works and does not
 
03:44:15.550 --> 03:44:15.560 align:start position:0%
need fixing
 
03:44:17.550 --> 03:44:17.560 align:start position:0%
so what is the point of this
 
03:44:19.870 --> 03:44:19.880 align:start position:0%
bill dissolving the New Hampshire
 
03:44:22.790 --> 03:44:22.800 align:start position:0%
vaccine Association will result in fewer
 
03:44:26.429 --> 03:44:26.439 align:start position:0%
children being vaccinated in the Granite
 
03:44:29.229 --> 03:44:29.239 align:start position:0%
State this will result in outbreaks of
 
03:44:31.429 --> 03:44:31.439 align:start position:0%
preventable diseases as we have seen
 
03:44:34.070 --> 03:44:34.080 align:start position:0%
happening in the US where vaccination
 
03:44:35.429 --> 03:44:35.439 align:start position:0%
rates have
 
03:44:38.349 --> 03:44:38.359 align:start position:0%
declined vaccines have saved more lives
 
03:44:41.149 --> 03:44:41.159 align:start position:0%
than any other medical intervention in
 
03:44:43.830 --> 03:44:43.840 align:start position:0%
history if you don't believe that I have
 
03:44:46.790 --> 03:44:46.800 align:start position:0%
one word for you
 
03:44:49.269 --> 03:44:49.279 align:start position:0%
polio do you think polio is not a
 
03:44:51.790 --> 03:44:51.800 align:start position:0%
problem anymore there have been recent
 
03:44:55.149 --> 03:44:55.159 align:start position:0%
cases of paralytic po polio in
 
03:44:55.159 --> 03:44:56.950 align:start position:0%
cases of paralytic po polio in
unvaccinated

03:44:56.950 --> 03:44:56.960 align:start position:0%
unvaccinated
 
03:44:59.510 --> 03:44:59.520 align:start position:0%
communities this is a tragedy I know
 
03:45:01.429 --> 03:45:01.439 align:start position:0%
something about
 
03:45:03.550 --> 03:45:03.560 align:start position:0%
personally my husband's father
 
03:45:05.750 --> 03:45:05.760 align:start position:0%
contracted polio in the
 
03:45:08.149 --> 03:45:08.159 align:start position:0%
1955 epidemic in
 
03:45:10.389 --> 03:45:10.399 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts he was a healthy
 
03:45:13.630 --> 03:45:13.640 align:start position:0%
34-year-old World War II vet who came
 
03:45:16.070 --> 03:45:16.080 align:start position:0%
home from work on a Friday afternoon
 
03:45:19.349 --> 03:45:19.359 align:start position:0%
feeling like he had the flu and he never
 
03:45:19.359 --> 03:45:21.229 align:start position:0%
feeling like he had the flu and he never
walked

03:45:21.229 --> 03:45:21.239 align:start position:0%
walked
 
03:45:23.990 --> 03:45:24.000 align:start position:0%
again he had one of the worst cases of
 
03:45:27.189 --> 03:45:27.199 align:start position:0%
the most severe form of polio to
 
03:45:30.389 --> 03:45:30.399 align:start position:0%
survive the cruel irony is that all four
 
03:45:33.149 --> 03:45:33.159 align:start position:0%
of his children including my husband
 
03:45:36.110 --> 03:45:36.120 align:start position:0%
were vaccinated the year before but they
 
03:45:38.630 --> 03:45:38.640 align:start position:0%
hadn't rolled out the so vaccine for
 
03:45:42.469 --> 03:45:42.479 align:start position:0%
adults yet the children were fine but
 
03:45:46.710 --> 03:45:46.720 align:start position:0%
Bruce do did survive while many died
 
03:45:49.510 --> 03:45:49.520 align:start position:0%
and he lived another 21 years paralyzed
 
03:45:52.630 --> 03:45:52.640 align:start position:0%
from the neck down most of the time in
 
03:45:56.630 --> 03:45:56.640 align:start position:0%
an iron lung because dis the disease
 
03:45:59.349 --> 03:45:59.359 align:start position:0%
destroyed his voluntary nervous system
 
03:46:01.510 --> 03:46:01.520 align:start position:0%
and he could not breathe without it
 
03:46:04.750 --> 03:46:04.760 align:start position:0%
without him an iron lung and I knew him
 
03:46:08.149 --> 03:46:08.159 align:start position:0%
as a child as our families were close
 
03:46:11.189 --> 03:46:11.199 align:start position:0%
and I still remember overcoming my fear
 
03:46:13.389 --> 03:46:13.399 align:start position:0%
as a little girl of The Man in the
 
03:46:16.710 --> 03:46:16.720 align:start position:0%
machine with just his head sticking out
 
03:46:18.670 --> 03:46:18.680 align:start position:0%
despite his paralysis he played a
 
03:46:20.950 --> 03:46:20.960 align:start position:0%
powerful role as a father in a member of
 
03:46:23.189 --> 03:46:23.199 align:start position:0%
his community and his family was
 
03:46:24.630 --> 03:46:24.640 align:start position:0%
grateful that he
 
03:46:26.910 --> 03:46:26.920 align:start position:0%
survived still my husband might have
 
03:46:28.790 --> 03:46:28.800 align:start position:0%
been happier to have a more normal
 
03:46:31.070 --> 03:46:31.080 align:start position:0%
childhood where he could hike with his
 
03:46:33.750 --> 03:46:33.760 align:start position:0%
father in the whites and play ball and
 
03:46:35.910 --> 03:46:35.920 align:start position:0%
not be changing his bed
 
03:46:39.590 --> 03:46:39.600 align:start position:0%
pan let us not go backward with the
 
03:46:42.070 --> 03:46:42.080 align:start position:0%
progress we've made in
 
03:46:47.070 --> 03:46:47.080 align:start position:0%
vaccines and please vote no on to
 
03:46:49.710 --> 03:46:49.720 align:start position:0%
pass representative kofos recognized to
 
03:46:52.389 --> 03:46:52.399 align:start position:0%
speak in support of the committee
 
03:46:54.710 --> 03:46:54.720 align:start position:0%
report thank you Mr
 
03:46:57.269 --> 03:46:57.279 align:start position:0%
Speaker let me say first and
 
03:47:00.469 --> 03:47:00.479 align:start position:0%
foremost this bill has nothing to do
 
03:47:03.750 --> 03:47:03.760 align:start position:0%
whatsoever with the merits of vaccines
 
03:47:06.910 --> 03:47:06.920 align:start position:0%
or the lack thereof it's not about more
 
03:47:09.149 --> 03:47:09.159 align:start position:0%
vaccines or fewer
 
03:47:12.309 --> 03:47:12.319 align:start position:0%
vaccines in fact the NIH did a study and
 
03:47:14.110 --> 03:47:14.120 align:start position:0%
found that compulsory bulk purchase
 
03:47:16.790 --> 03:47:16.800 align:start position:0%
programs for vac vacines do not impact
 
03:47:16.800 --> 03:47:22.070 align:start position:0%
programs for vac vacines do not impact
vaccination

03:47:22.070 --> 03:47:22.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:24.229 --> 03:47:24.239 align:start position:0%
rates so the New Hampshire vaccine
 
03:47:25.790 --> 03:47:25.800 align:start position:0%
Association is probably something that
 
03:47:27.149 --> 03:47:27.159 align:start position:0%
most of you don't know a lot about I
 
03:47:28.469 --> 03:47:28.479 align:start position:0%
didn't know a lot about it until I
 
03:47:30.950 --> 03:47:30.960 align:start position:0%
started to research this bill and the
 
03:47:33.429 --> 03:47:33.439 align:start position:0%
more I learned the more questions I
 
03:47:36.229 --> 03:47:36.239 align:start position:0%
had this is a nonprofit organization
 
03:47:38.990 --> 03:47:39.000 align:start position:0%
created by the legislature in 2002 under
 
03:47:39.000 --> 03:47:42.269 align:start position:0%
created by the legislature in 2002 under
RSA

03:47:42.269 --> 03:47:42.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:44.309 --> 03:47:44.319 align:start position:0%
126q but the New Hampshire vaccine
 
03:47:45.830 --> 03:47:45.840 align:start position:0%
Association is is not like any other
 
03:47:45.840 --> 03:47:48.790 align:start position:0%
Association is is not like any other
nonprofit

03:47:48.790 --> 03:47:48.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:51.030 --> 03:47:51.040 align:start position:0%
organization for one thing it has the
 
03:47:52.870 --> 03:47:52.880 align:start position:0%
power to Levy
 
03:47:55.149 --> 03:47:55.159 align:start position:0%
assessments I would call those taxes
 
03:47:56.870 --> 03:47:56.880 align:start position:0%
because they are compulsory payments
 
03:47:58.710 --> 03:47:58.720 align:start position:0%
levied against the insurance
 
03:48:01.790 --> 03:48:01.800 align:start position:0%
carriers they are not optional they are
 
03:48:01.800 --> 03:48:03.070 align:start position:0%
carriers they are not optional they are
not

03:48:03.070 --> 03:48:03.080 align:start position:0%
not
 
03:48:05.670 --> 03:48:05.680 align:start position:0%
voluntary in fact the statute contains
 
03:48:07.149 --> 03:48:07.159 align:start position:0%
Provisions saying
 
03:48:09.910 --> 03:48:09.920 align:start position:0%
that the state can revoke licenses of
 
03:48:09.920 --> 03:48:11.149 align:start position:0%
that the state can revoke licenses of
insurance

03:48:11.149 --> 03:48:11.159 align:start position:0%
insurance
 
03:48:13.990 --> 03:48:14.000 align:start position:0%
carriers that fail to make payment they
 
03:48:15.269 --> 03:48:15.279 align:start position:0%
can also
 
03:48:18.229 --> 03:48:18.239 align:start position:0%
uh Levy fines and penalties for late
 
03:48:26.429 --> 03:48:26.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:28.750 --> 03:48:28.760 align:start position:0%
voluntary secondly I find it very
 
03:48:29.830 --> 03:48:29.840 align:start position:0%
interesting that the New Hampshire
 
03:48:31.910 --> 03:48:31.920 align:start position:0%
vaccine Association member director
 
03:48:31.920 --> 03:48:33.229 align:start position:0%
vaccine Association member director
members

03:48:33.229 --> 03:48:33.239 align:start position:0%
members
 
03:48:36.030 --> 03:48:36.040 align:start position:0%
directors um employees and agents are
 
03:48:38.590 --> 03:48:38.600 align:start position:0%
shielded from all liability they are
 
03:48:41.349 --> 03:48:41.359 align:start position:0%
immune from liability under the statute
 
03:48:46.110 --> 03:48:46.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:47.630 --> 03:48:47.640 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire vaccine Association
 
03:48:49.229 --> 03:48:49.239 align:start position:0%
asserts that because it is a separate
 
03:48:51.229 --> 03:48:51.239 align:start position:0%
nonprofit organization it is not subject
 
03:48:53.309 --> 03:48:53.319 align:start position:0%
to our right to know law
 
03:48:56.349 --> 03:48:56.359 align:start position:0%
91a and they have Obed to even such
 
03:48:58.389 --> 03:48:58.399 align:start position:0%
simple measures as posting their Zoom
 
03:49:01.630 --> 03:49:01.640 align:start position:0%
meetings their monthly meetings online
 
03:49:04.630 --> 03:49:04.640 align:start position:0%
they said it would be burdensome to do
 
03:49:07.030 --> 03:49:07.040 align:start position:0%
so so Zoom has a feature that you can
 
03:49:09.189 --> 03:49:09.199 align:start position:0%
live turn on very easily live stream to
 
03:49:11.990 --> 03:49:12.000 align:start position:0%
YouTube and it's posted and um
 
03:49:14.149 --> 03:49:14.159 align:start position:0%
maintained online so I think the
 
03:49:16.149 --> 03:49:16.159 align:start position:0%
assertion that
 
03:49:21.710 --> 03:49:21.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:24.469 --> 03:49:24.479 align:start position:0%
hyperbole so what we see is uh is an
 
03:49:27.149 --> 03:49:27.159 align:start position:0%
organization created under estate law
 
03:49:29.070 --> 03:49:29.080 align:start position:0%
that is unlike any other nonprofit that
 
03:49:31.550 --> 03:49:31.560 align:start position:0%
I'm aware of and that suffers from a
 
03:49:34.070 --> 03:49:34.080 align:start position:0%
disturbing lack of transparency and
 
03:49:35.950 --> 03:49:35.960 align:start position:0%
accountability so what does the vaccine
 
03:49:37.630 --> 03:49:37.640 align:start position:0%
Association do well every year they work
 
03:49:38.830 --> 03:49:38.840 align:start position:0%
with the Department of Health and Human
 
03:49:40.550 --> 03:49:40.560 align:start position:0%
Services to estimate the number of doses
 
03:49:41.710 --> 03:49:41.720 align:start position:0%
of vaccines that are going to be
 
03:49:44.149 --> 03:49:44.159 align:start position:0%
required for insured children in the
 
03:49:44.159 --> 03:49:45.830 align:start position:0%
required for insured children in the
state

03:49:45.830 --> 03:49:45.840 align:start position:0%
state
 
03:49:48.429 --> 03:49:48.439 align:start position:0%
they collect money or assessments from
 
03:49:51.590 --> 03:49:51.600 align:start position:0%
the insurance carriers and they uh they
 
03:49:53.189 --> 03:49:53.199 align:start position:0%
provide that those funds for bulk
 
03:49:54.229 --> 03:49:54.239 align:start position:0%
purchase of
 
03:49:57.189 --> 03:49:57.199 align:start position:0%
vaccines now this only covers insured
 
03:50:00.790 --> 03:50:00.800 align:start position:0%
children so insured children are covered
 
03:50:02.750 --> 03:50:02.760 align:start position:0%
for vaccines under the Affordable Care
 
03:50:05.229 --> 03:50:05.239 align:start position:0%
Act insurance carriers are required to
 
03:50:08.269 --> 03:50:08.279 align:start position:0%
pay 100% of those costs there's no
 
03:50:12.030 --> 03:50:12.040 align:start position:0%
co-pay so if this bill doesn't
 
03:50:15.630 --> 03:50:15.640 align:start position:0%
pass families get those those vaccines
 
03:50:18.030 --> 03:50:18.040 align:start position:0%
without any kind of co-payment if this
 
03:50:20.790 --> 03:50:20.800 align:start position:0%
does pass families get those vaccines
 
03:50:22.389 --> 03:50:22.399 align:start position:0%
without any kind of
 
03:50:24.550 --> 03:50:24.560 align:start position:0%
co-payment let's talk about uninsured
 
03:50:27.070 --> 03:50:27.080 align:start position:0%
children this doesn't affect them
 
03:50:28.550 --> 03:50:28.560 align:start position:0%
vaccines for uninsured children and
 
03:50:30.990 --> 03:50:31.000 align:start position:0%
Medicaid are purchased through the or or
 
03:50:32.910 --> 03:50:32.920 align:start position:0%
acquired through a federally funded
 
03:50:39.670 --> 03:50:39.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:43.469 --> 03:50:43.479 align:start position:0%
children so ostensibly the program by by
 
03:50:45.870 --> 03:50:45.880 align:start position:0%
assessing money from from the insurance
 
03:50:49.229 --> 03:50:49.239 align:start position:0%
carriers um in in engaging in this bulk
 
03:50:51.269 --> 03:50:51.279 align:start position:0%
purchase of vaccines ostensibly it's
 
03:50:51.279 --> 03:50:52.429 align:start position:0%
purchase of vaccines ostensibly it's
saving

03:50:52.429 --> 03:50:52.439 align:start position:0%
saving
 
03:50:57.309 --> 03:50:57.319 align:start position:0%
money but does it really and at what
 
03:50:59.830 --> 03:50:59.840 align:start position:0%
cost the Bill's opponents have cited
 
03:51:03.870 --> 03:51:03.880 align:start position:0%
cost of $200 to $400 per dose depending
 
03:51:07.389 --> 03:51:07.399 align:start position:0%
on the vaccine that is an an MSRP it's a
 
03:51:09.710 --> 03:51:09.720 align:start position:0%
little bit like the MSRP you see um on
 
03:51:12.790 --> 03:51:12.800 align:start position:0%
car ads nobody actually pays
 
03:51:16.469 --> 03:51:16.479 align:start position:0%
it but by by negotiating a 30% discount
 
03:51:18.429 --> 03:51:18.439 align:start position:0%
on that presumably they're passing that
 
03:51:20.469 --> 03:51:20.479 align:start position:0%
on to the insurance
 
03:51:23.670 --> 03:51:23.680 align:start position:0%
carriers it's interesting however that
 
03:51:25.670 --> 03:51:25.680 align:start position:0%
not a single insurance carrier showed up
 
03:51:27.790 --> 03:51:27.800 align:start position:0%
at the at the bill hearing to testify
 
03:51:31.469 --> 03:51:31.479 align:start position:0%
against this bill only six states have
 
03:51:34.229 --> 03:51:34.239 align:start position:0%
compulsory vaccine bulk bulk vaccine
 
03:51:36.349 --> 03:51:36.359 align:start position:0%
purchase programs like New Hampshire's
 
03:51:38.309 --> 03:51:38.319 align:start position:0%
most of them date back uh many many
 
03:51:40.149 --> 03:51:40.159 align:start position:0%
years and Most states have rejected such
 
03:51:42.950 --> 03:51:42.960 align:start position:0%
programs as being too costly and
 
03:51:46.830 --> 03:51:46.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:48.870 --> 03:51:48.880 align:start position:0%
so although I am yet to be convinced it
 
03:51:51.149 --> 03:51:51.159 align:start position:0%
is possible that insurance carriers are
 
03:51:52.950 --> 03:51:52.960 align:start position:0%
saving a bit of
 
03:51:56.229 --> 03:51:56.239 align:start position:0%
money if that is the case then they are
 
03:51:59.670 --> 03:51:59.680 align:start position:0%
doing that at a cost to New Hampshire
 
03:52:01.910 --> 03:52:01.920 align:start position:0%
taxpayers every year the Department of
 
03:52:04.110 --> 03:52:04.120 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services incurs
 
03:52:06.670 --> 03:52:06.680 align:start position:0%
costs of close to a million dollars for
 
03:52:08.750 --> 03:52:08.760 align:start position:0%
running the vaccine program for fisal
 
03:52:08.760 --> 03:52:09.790 align:start position:0%
running the vaccine program for fisal
year

03:52:09.790 --> 03:52:09.800 align:start position:0%
year
 
03:52:16.309 --> 03:52:16.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:19.030 --> 03:52:19.040 align:start position:0%
61 every year they submit a request to
 
03:52:21.389 --> 03:52:21.399 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire vaccine Association to
 
03:52:24.630 --> 03:52:24.640 align:start position:0%
pay 60% of that cost because 60% of the
 
03:52:27.389 --> 03:52:27.399 align:start position:0%
vaccines purchased
 
03:52:29.469 --> 03:52:29.479 align:start position:0%
are covered under the New Hampshire
 
03:52:31.349 --> 03:52:31.359 align:start position:0%
vaccine Association
 
03:52:34.510 --> 03:52:34.520 align:start position:0%
program the vaccine Association in 2018
 
03:52:36.189 --> 03:52:36.199 align:start position:0%
issued a letter stating that they had no
 
03:52:38.070 --> 03:52:38.080 align:start position:0%
intention of ever paying this they don't
 
03:52:40.309 --> 03:52:40.319 align:start position:0%
believe that the statute authorizes it
 
03:52:43.149 --> 03:52:43.159 align:start position:0%
so they're not covering it that leaves
 
03:52:50.910 --> 03:52:50.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:52.790 --> 03:52:52.800 align:start position:0%
as I said before those who argue that
 
03:52:55.870 --> 03:52:55.880 align:start position:0%
this affects vaccination rates in any
 
03:52:55.880 --> 03:52:57.630 align:start position:0%
this affects vaccination rates in any
way

03:52:57.630 --> 03:52:57.640 align:start position:0%
way
 
03:53:00.269 --> 03:53:00.279 align:start position:0%
um are are wrong the NIH studied
 
03:53:02.269 --> 03:53:02.279 align:start position:0%
compulsory uh programs like this and
 
03:53:04.149 --> 03:53:04.159 align:start position:0%
said that they were quote ineffective in
 
03:53:06.269 --> 03:53:06.279 align:start position:0%
increasing vaccination rates and
 
03:53:08.309 --> 03:53:08.319 align:start position:0%
recommended that quote policy makers
 
03:53:09.990 --> 03:53:10.000 align:start position:0%
seeking to increase vaccination rates
 
03:53:12.590 --> 03:53:12.600 align:start position:0%
would do well to consider other policies
 
03:53:14.149 --> 03:53:14.159 align:start position:0%
such as addressing provider practice
 
03:53:17.389 --> 03:53:17.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:19.670 --> 03:53:19.680 align:start position:0%
hesitancy so finally I'd like to Circle
 
03:53:21.469 --> 03:53:21.479 align:start position:0%
back to to the the false claims that
 
03:53:22.870 --> 03:53:22.880 align:start position:0%
this bill would negatively impact
 
03:53:24.910 --> 03:53:24.920 align:start position:0%
families there was a a an editorial that
 
03:53:26.309 --> 03:53:26.319 align:start position:0%
appeared recently in one of our
 
03:53:28.910 --> 03:53:28.920 align:start position:0%
newspapers in New Hampshire stating that
 
03:53:31.469 --> 03:53:31.479 align:start position:0%
the uh vaccine Association quote removes
 
03:53:33.349 --> 03:53:33.359 align:start position:0%
access and financial barriers for
 
03:53:35.950 --> 03:53:35.960 align:start position:0%
parents who want their child to be
 
03:53:38.510 --> 03:53:38.520 align:start position:0%
immunized that is not the
 
03:53:40.670 --> 03:53:40.680 align:start position:0%
case they don't pay anything for the
 
03:53:42.790 --> 03:53:42.800 align:start position:0%
vaccine when they go to the doctor today
 
03:53:44.950 --> 03:53:44.960 align:start position:0%
and if this bill is passed passed and
 
03:53:47.149 --> 03:53:47.159 align:start position:0%
becomes law they won't pay anything for
 
03:53:50.269 --> 03:53:50.279 align:start position:0%
it tomorrow or a year from now or 5
 
03:53:52.870 --> 03:53:52.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:55.550 --> 03:53:55.560 align:start position:0%
now the claim that any child would have
 
03:53:57.469 --> 03:53:57.479 align:start position:0%
any less vaccine coverage is patently
 
03:54:00.030 --> 03:54:00.040 align:start position:0%
false House Bill 524 would not only
 
03:54:02.590 --> 03:54:02.600 align:start position:0%
reduce any new Co would not result in
 
03:54:04.910 --> 03:54:04.920 align:start position:0%
any new cost for families it would
 
03:54:07.309 --> 03:54:07.319 align:start position:0%
simply eliminate a a bureaucracy that
 
03:54:09.710 --> 03:54:09.720 align:start position:0%
serves no legitimate purpose and that
 
03:54:11.950 --> 03:54:11.960 align:start position:0%
suffers from a disturbing lack of
 
03:54:15.389 --> 03:54:15.399 align:start position:0%
transparency and accountability
 
03:54:17.670 --> 03:54:17.680 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker I urge my colleagues to
 
03:54:19.590 --> 03:54:19.600 align:start position:0%
support this
 
03:54:22.510 --> 03:54:22.520 align:start position:0%
bill so that we can get uh transparency
 
03:54:23.910 --> 03:54:23.920 align:start position:0%
and accountability for New Hampshire
 
03:54:26.189 --> 03:54:26.199 align:start position:0%
taxpayers and get government out of this
 
03:54:29.510 --> 03:54:29.520 align:start position:0%
business thank you Mr Speaker
 
03:54:32.710 --> 03:54:32.720 align:start position:0%
call Representative Granger requests a
 
03:54:34.670 --> 03:54:34.680 align:start position:0%
roll call is that sufficiently
 
03:54:37.349 --> 03:54:37.359 align:start position:0%
seconded oh sure everybody wants it this
 
03:54:39.110 --> 03:54:39.120 align:start position:0%
will be a roll call vote members take
 
03:54:39.120 --> 03:54:43.309 align:start position:0%
will be a roll call vote members take
your

03:54:43.309 --> 03:54:43.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:40.189 --> 03:55:40.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:41.469 --> 03:55:41.479 align:start position:0%
questions on the majority committee
 
03:55:43.710 --> 03:55:43.720 align:start position:0%
report of ought to pass on House Bill
 
03:55:47.189 --> 03:55:47.199 align:start position:0%
520 four representative lon's recognized
 
03:55:50.389 --> 03:55:50.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:52.910 --> 03:55:52.920 align:start position:0%
inquiry thank you Mr
 
03:55:56.349 --> 03:55:56.359 align:start position:0%
Speaker if I knew that there was no
 
03:56:00.349 --> 03:56:00.359 align:start position:0%
credible evidence of any kind of fraud
 
03:56:02.910 --> 03:56:02.920 align:start position:0%
presented about the VA I mean the
 
03:56:02.920 --> 03:56:05.349 align:start position:0%
presented about the VA I mean the
vaccination

03:56:05.349 --> 03:56:05.359 align:start position:0%
vaccination
 
03:56:08.149 --> 03:56:08.159 align:start position:0%
Association and if I
 
03:56:12.229 --> 03:56:12.239 align:start position:0%
knew that not a single insurance company
 
03:56:15.710 --> 03:56:15.720 align:start position:0%
came to support this bill
 
03:56:19.870 --> 03:56:19.880 align:start position:0%
and that many medical providers came to
 
03:56:23.870 --> 03:56:23.880 align:start position:0%
oppose the bill if I knew the public had
 
03:56:26.910 --> 03:56:26.920 align:start position:0%
overwhelming support
 
03:56:31.389 --> 03:56:31.399 align:start position:0%
or spoke overwhelmingly against this
 
03:56:34.309 --> 03:56:34.319 align:start position:0%
bill and if I know that dissolving the
 
03:56:38.030 --> 03:56:38.040 align:start position:0%
vaccine Association will make it harder
 
03:56:41.469 --> 03:56:41.479 align:start position:0%
for children to be vaccinated in the
 
03:56:44.990 --> 03:56:45.000 align:start position:0%
state and if I know that this will will
 
03:56:48.429 --> 03:56:48.439 align:start position:0%
result in lower vaccination rates and
 
03:56:48.439 --> 03:56:50.189 align:start position:0%
result in lower vaccination rates and
potentially

03:56:50.189 --> 03:56:50.199 align:start position:0%
potentially
 
03:56:53.389 --> 03:56:53.399 align:start position:0%
outbreaks would I press the red button
 
03:56:56.710 --> 03:56:56.720 align:start position:0%
so that a better motion may be brought
 
03:56:58.790 --> 03:56:58.800 align:start position:0%
forward representative McDonald's
 
03:57:02.590 --> 03:57:02.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:06.189 --> 03:57:06.199 align:start position:0%
inquir thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker
 
03:57:08.670 --> 03:57:08.680 align:start position:0%
if I know that while well intentioned
 
03:57:10.950 --> 03:57:10.960 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire vaccine Association is
 
03:57:13.670 --> 03:57:13.680 align:start position:0%
not a costeffective program and it would
 
03:57:15.910 --> 03:57:15.920 align:start position:0%
be more efficient for vaccine providers
 
03:57:17.870 --> 03:57:17.880 align:start position:0%
to purchase and control their own
 
03:57:20.590 --> 03:57:20.600 align:start position:0%
vaccine inventories to meet the needs of
 
03:57:22.070 --> 03:57:22.080 align:start position:0%
the patients they
 
03:57:24.790 --> 03:57:24.800 align:start position:0%
serve and Mr Speaker if I know that this
 
03:57:26.910 --> 03:57:26.920 align:start position:0%
bill will not increase the costs of
 
03:57:29.710 --> 03:57:29.720 align:start position:0%
parents through deductibles or co-pays
 
03:57:32.469 --> 03:57:32.479 align:start position:0%
because Federal Law requires that all
 
03:57:34.750 --> 03:57:34.760 align:start position:0%
vaccines for children be provided at no
 
03:57:37.750 --> 03:57:37.760 align:start position:0%
cost to the parent Mr Speaker if I know
 
03:57:39.189 --> 03:57:39.199 align:start position:0%
these things would I then press the
 
03:57:41.550 --> 03:57:41.560 align:start position:0%
green button and vote ought to
 
03:57:43.670 --> 03:57:43.680 align:start position:0%
pass the questions on the majority
 
03:57:45.229 --> 03:57:45.239 align:start position:0%
committee report about to pass an House
 
03:57:47.910 --> 03:57:47.920 align:start position:0%
Bill 524 this is a roll call vote if

at no cost to the taxpayers and its
 
04:00:44.229 --> 04:00:44.239 align:start position:0%
members accumulate information
 
04:00:47.189 --> 04:00:47.199 align:start position:0%
about autism spectrum disorders uh and
 
04:00:50.030 --> 04:00:50.040 align:start position:0%
provide educational resources and advice
 
04:00:52.550 --> 04:00:52.560 align:start position:0%
to those affected by
 
04:00:57.229 --> 04:00:57.239 align:start position:0%
autism House Bill 634 as written is a
 
04:01:00.870 --> 04:01:00.880 align:start position:0%
bipartisan housekeeping bill that was
 
04:01:04.309 --> 04:01:04.319 align:start position:0%
written to reinvigorate this Council it
 
04:01:06.469 --> 04:01:06.479 align:start position:0%
was brought to this legislature by those
 
04:01:09.070 --> 04:01:09.080 align:start position:0%
who have recently taken over the
 
04:01:12.070 --> 04:01:12.080 align:start position:0%
committee and tried to reinvigorate it
 
04:01:14.070 --> 04:01:14.080 align:start position:0%
now that the impacts of Co have been and
 
04:01:14.080 --> 04:01:15.429 align:start position:0%
now that the impacts of Co have been and
settled

04:01:15.429 --> 04:01:15.439 align:start position:0%
settled
 
04:01:19.670 --> 04:01:19.680 align:start position:0%
down it does a few simple things it more
 
04:01:22.710 --> 04:01:22.720 align:start position:0%
tightly defines the purposes of the
 
04:01:25.750 --> 04:01:25.760 align:start position:0%
commission that makes it more realistic
 
04:01:28.590 --> 04:01:28.600 align:start position:0%
for a commission run by volunteers with
 
04:01:30.950 --> 04:01:30.960 align:start position:0%
no cost to
 
04:01:34.030 --> 04:01:34.040 align:start position:0%
achieve it allows remote participation
 
04:01:36.469 --> 04:01:36.479 align:start position:0%
for those with disability to participate
 
04:01:38.710 --> 04:01:38.720 align:start position:0%
in the commission it expands the
 
04:01:41.830 --> 04:01:41.840 align:start position:0%
membership by two members and it Alters
 
04:01:44.030 --> 04:01:44.040 align:start position:0%
the nominating process for members to to
 
04:01:47.030 --> 04:01:47.040 align:start position:0%
avoid vacancies for example right now
 
04:01:50.309 --> 04:01:50.319 align:start position:0%
there are seven openings on the council
 
04:01:53.030 --> 04:01:53.040 align:start position:0%
and five are nominated by the governor
 
04:01:55.469 --> 04:01:55.479 align:start position:0%
the council has met several times in the
 
04:01:58.110 --> 04:01:58.120 align:start position:0%
past year but with so many openings they
 
04:01:59.830 --> 04:01:59.840 align:start position:0%
did not achieve a
 
04:02:03.189 --> 04:02:03.199 align:start position:0%
quorum one thing the council did do was
 
04:02:05.550 --> 04:02:05.560 align:start position:0%
come to us the legislature and ask us to
 
04:02:07.269 --> 04:02:07.279 align:start position:0%
make some changes to their Charters and
 
04:02:09.950 --> 04:02:09.960 align:start position:0%
rules so that they could be effective
 
04:02:14.149 --> 04:02:14.159 align:start position:0%
for those with autism spectrum disorders
 
04:02:16.790 --> 04:02:16.800 align:start position:0%
the amendment that we're talking about
 
04:02:19.870 --> 04:02:19.880 align:start position:0%
is predicated on the assumption that the
 
04:02:21.950 --> 04:02:21.960 align:start position:0%
work of this committee could be
 
04:02:24.670 --> 04:02:24.680 align:start position:0%
performed by the development service
 
04:02:27.710 --> 04:02:27.720 align:start position:0%
quality Council but many people with
 
04:02:30.229 --> 04:02:30.239 align:start position:0%
autism spectrum disorder do not meet the
 
04:02:33.110 --> 04:02:33.120 align:start position:0%
legal definition of disability so those
 
04:02:36.429 --> 04:02:36.439 align:start position:0%
people would not be represented at all
 
04:02:39.389 --> 04:02:39.399 align:start position:0%
uh in that committee the energetic and
 
04:02:41.550 --> 04:02:41.560 align:start position:0%
experienced people who are
 
04:02:44.349 --> 04:02:44.359 align:start position:0%
reinvigorating this Council feel there's
 
04:02:47.149 --> 04:02:47.159 align:start position:0%
an unmet need with that can only be done
 
04:02:49.189 --> 04:02:49.199 align:start position:0%
by this
 
04:02:52.229 --> 04:02:52.239 align:start position:0%
Council so with the housekeeping changes
 
04:02:54.149 --> 04:02:54.159 align:start position:0%
and the highquality individuals who are
 
04:02:56.229 --> 04:02:56.239 align:start position:0%
now in place supporting those with
 
04:02:59.189 --> 04:02:59.199 align:start position:0%
autism spectrum disorders the better
 
04:03:01.910 --> 04:03:01.920 align:start position:0%
solution for us is to vote read on the
 
04:03:04.309 --> 04:03:04.319 align:start position:0%
amendment so that this original
 
04:03:07.790 --> 04:03:07.800 align:start position:0%
bipartisan bill can be
 
04:03:11.790 --> 04:03:11.800 align:start position:0%
passed and so I would ask uh for you to
 
04:03:14.870 --> 04:03:14.880 align:start position:0%
vote r on the amendment and Mr Speaker I
 
04:03:18.229 --> 04:03:18.239 align:start position:0%
ask for a division vote thank
 
04:03:20.750 --> 04:03:20.760 align:start position:0%
you representative Drews recognized to
 
04:03:25.189 --> 04:03:25.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:28.189 --> 04:03:28.199 align:start position:0%
amendment thank you Mr Speaker the case
 
04:03:30.389 --> 04:03:30.399 align:start position:0%
for this bill as amended is simple the
 
04:03:34.070 --> 04:03:34.080 align:start position:0%
council has not met since 2019 and has
 
04:03:36.790 --> 04:03:36.800 align:start position:0%
not submitted a annual report since
 
04:03:39.070 --> 04:03:39.080 align:start position:0%
2017 there have been many opportunities
 
04:03:40.710 --> 04:03:40.720 align:start position:0%
to revive the council but it has not
 
04:03:43.149 --> 04:03:43.159 align:start position:0%
happened we learned from constituents
 
04:03:45.070 --> 04:03:45.080 align:start position:0%
that this coun 's mission is largely
 
04:03:46.830 --> 04:03:46.840 align:start position:0%
duplicative of the work already being
 
04:03:48.630 --> 04:03:48.640 align:start position:0%
done by the New Hampshire developmental
 
04:03:50.990 --> 04:03:51.000 align:start position:0%
Services quality Council thus I have
 
04:03:52.630 --> 04:03:52.640 align:start position:0%
urge you I urge you to vote for the
 
04:03:54.630 --> 04:03:54.640 align:start position:0%
amendment and repeal this defunct
 
04:03:57.469 --> 04:03:57.479 align:start position:0%
Council thank
 
04:04:00.070 --> 04:04:00.080 align:start position:0%
you a division vote has been requested
 
04:04:01.630 --> 04:04:01.640 align:start position:0%
this will be a division vote members
 
04:04:12.710 --> 04:04:12.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:54.469 --> 04:04:54.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:55.710 --> 04:04:55.720 align:start position:0%
the questions on the adoption of
 
04:04:58.990 --> 04:04:59.000 align:start position:0%
amendment 0344 H this is a division vote
 
04:05:00.590 --> 04:05:00.600 align:start position:0%
representative Weber is recognized for
 
04:05:00.600 --> 04:05:02.710 align:start position:0%
representative Weber is recognized for
parliamentary

04:05:02.710 --> 04:05:02.720 align:start position:0%
parliamentary
 
04:05:06.429 --> 04:05:06.439 align:start position:0%
inquiry thank you Mr Speaker if I know
 
04:05:09.189 --> 04:05:09.199 align:start position:0%
that the council as
 
04:05:11.389 --> 04:05:11.399 align:start position:0%
reconstituted would provide a much
 
04:05:14.429 --> 04:05:14.439 align:start position:0%
needed specialty lens for those people
 
04:05:17.550 --> 04:05:17.560 align:start position:0%
with autism spectrum disorder and if I
 
04:05:19.550 --> 04:05:19.560 align:start position:0%
know that those people will not be
 
04:05:21.910 --> 04:05:21.920 align:start position:0%
adequately represented on the
 
04:05:24.189 --> 04:05:24.199 align:start position:0%
developmental Services quality Council
 
04:05:28.070 --> 04:05:28.080 align:start position:0%
because many of them do not meet the
 
04:05:32.830 --> 04:05:32.840 align:start position:0%
definition of disabled would I now press
 
04:05:35.550 --> 04:05:35.560 align:start position:0%
red to defeat the amendment so we could
 
04:05:37.469 --> 04:05:37.479 align:start position:0%
pass the original
 
04:05:39.550 --> 04:05:39.560 align:start position:0%

Speaker Mr Speaker if I know that the
 
04:05:50.510 --> 04:05:50.520 align:start position:0%
repeal of this body makes sense because
 
04:05:52.950 --> 04:05:52.960 align:start position:0%
as was pointed out it has not meant
 
04:05:55.229 --> 04:05:55.239 align:start position:0%
since 2019 and it has not issued an
 
04:05:57.309 --> 04:05:57.319 align:start position:0%
annual report since
 
04:05:59.950 --> 04:05:59.960 align:start position:0%
2017 and Mr Speaker if I know that the
 
04:06:01.790 --> 04:06:01.800 align:start position:0%
mission of the New Hampshire Council on
 
04:06:04.510 --> 04:06:04.520 align:start position:0%
autism spectrum disorders is already
 
04:06:06.309 --> 04:06:06.319 align:start position:0%
being performed by the New Hampshire

a lead poisoning problem for our

Speaker Mr Speaker if I know that this
 
04:19:18.670 --> 04:19:18.680 align:start position:0%
bill creates a significant expense for
 
04:19:21.229 --> 04:19:21.239 align:start position:0%
landlords without resolving the issue of
 
04:19:22.950 --> 04:19:22.960 align:start position:0%
lead paint poisoning and
 
04:19:25.389 --> 04:19:25.399 align:start position:0%
Remediation and Mr Speaker if I know
 
04:19:27.389 --> 04:19:27.399 align:start position:0%
this because lead paint abatement is not
 
04:19:30.269 --> 04:19:30.279 align:start position:0%
only expensive but does not fully remove
 
04:19:32.109 --> 04:19:32.119 align:start position:0%
the hazard and the hazard can be
 
04:19:32.119 --> 04:19:33.469 align:start position:0%
the hazard and the hazard can be
repeatedly

04:19:33.469 --> 04:19:33.479 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr
 
04:22:20.630 --> 04:22:20.640 align:start position:0%
Speaker Mr
 
04:22:23.109 --> 04:22:23.119 align:start position:0%
Speaker in the world of substance abuse
 
04:22:25.910 --> 04:22:25.920 align:start position:0%
recovery everybody has heard of 12-step
 
04:22:28.070 --> 04:22:28.080 align:start position:0%
programs the most famous being
 
04:22:31.750 --> 04:22:31.760 align:start position:0%
alcoholics or Narcotics Anonymous
 
04:22:33.950 --> 04:22:33.960 align:start position:0%
however one step that everybody
 
04:22:35.590 --> 04:22:35.600 align:start position:0%
navigating the road to recovery needs to
 
04:22:38.870 --> 04:22:38.880 align:start position:0%
be aware of is the 13th Step In This
 
04:22:40.510 --> 04:22:40.520 align:start position:0%
step the person who is new to the
 
04:22:42.830 --> 04:22:42.840 align:start position:0%
recovery program is targeted for a
 
04:22:45.309 --> 04:22:45.319 align:start position:0%
sexual relationship by a counselor or a
 
04:22:47.429 --> 04:22:47.439 align:start position:0%
person further along in their recovery
 
04:22:50.149 --> 04:22:50.159 align:start position:0%
journey I can think a few things as file
 
04:22:52.149 --> 04:22:52.159 align:start position:0%
as praying on people in the very
 
04:22:55.550 --> 04:22:55.560 align:start position:0%
vulnerable state of overcoming addiction
 
04:22:58.750 --> 04:22:58.760 align:start position:0%
sadly in New Hampshire The 13th Step is
 
04:23:00.990 --> 04:23:01.000 align:start position:0%
incredibly widespread and it's very hard
 
04:23:02.870 --> 04:23:02.880 align:start position:0%
to get a handle on because the substance
 
04:23:04.469 --> 04:23:04.479 align:start position:0%
abuse treatment landscape in New
 
04:23:07.309 --> 04:23:07.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is almost completely
 
04:23:11.349 --> 04:23:11.359 align:start position:0%
unregulated HB 751 addresses this issue
 
04:23:13.309 --> 04:23:13.319 align:start position:0%
by establishing a license program for
 
04:23:15.229 --> 04:23:15.239 align:start position:0%
out patient substance abuse treatment
 
04:23:17.429 --> 04:23:17.439 align:start position:0%
facilities and creating an utman
 
04:23:20.710 --> 04:23:20.720 align:start position:0%
position to investigate and resolve
 
04:23:23.030 --> 04:23:23.040 align:start position:0%
complaints the bill originally came to
 
04:23:25.469 --> 04:23:25.479 align:start position:0%
us last year and it was full of holes
 
04:23:26.950 --> 04:23:26.960 align:start position:0%
there was no way the committee could
 
04:23:29.269 --> 04:23:29.279 align:start position:0%
have passed it but the amendment we just
 
04:23:31.870 --> 04:23:31.880 align:start position:0%
passed really tightened up the bill it
 
04:23:33.550 --> 04:23:33.560 align:start position:0%
took out residential
 
04:23:35.630 --> 04:23:35.640 align:start position:0%
facilities explicitly Exempted
 
04:23:38.109 --> 04:23:38.119 align:start position:0%
non-clinical programs like AA and
 
04:23:40.189 --> 04:23:40.199 align:start position:0%
streamline the process by Rolling the
 
04:23:42.030 --> 04:23:42.040 align:start position:0%
certification into the existing
 
04:23:44.469 --> 04:23:44.479 align:start position:0%
Healthcare care facili licensing statute
 
04:23:47.109 --> 04:23:47.119 align:start position:0%
instead of creating a separate licensing
 
04:23:50.750 --> 04:23:50.760 align:start position:0%
infrastructure so this is a very clean
 
04:23:53.910 --> 04:23:53.920 align:start position:0%
bill we heard testimony in committee
 
04:23:55.550 --> 04:23:55.560 align:start position:0%
from a woman whose son went to treatment
 
04:23:58.630 --> 04:23:58.640 align:start position:0%
for alcoholism six times before he died
 
04:24:00.830 --> 04:24:00.840 align:start position:0%
after his death they came to learn that
 
04:24:02.349 --> 04:24:02.359 align:start position:0%
everything he was told to do well in
 
04:24:05.189 --> 04:24:05.199 align:start position:0%
treatment was wrong and completely
 
04:24:08.670 --> 04:24:08.680 align:start position:0%
non-evidence-based he didn't need to die
 
04:24:10.469 --> 04:24:10.479 align:start position:0%
we heard testimony from a woman working
 
04:24:13.349 --> 04:24:13.359 align:start position:0%
in Corrections Who mandated other women
 
04:24:16.229 --> 04:24:16.239 align:start position:0%
into substance abuse treatment when the
 
04:24:17.950 --> 04:24:17.960 align:start position:0%
woman she sent into treatment came back
 
04:24:19.750 --> 04:24:19.760 align:start position:0%
and told her that she'd been sexually
 
04:24:22.790 --> 04:24:22.800 align:start position:0%
abused she investigated and discovered
 
04:24:24.510 --> 04:24:24.520 align:start position:0%
that five other women that she had sent
 
04:24:27.429 --> 04:24:27.439 align:start position:0%
to the same facility had met a similar
 
04:24:30.830 --> 04:24:30.840 align:start position:0%
fate the realization that she had forced
 
04:24:32.469 --> 04:24:32.479 align:start position:0%
these women into the hands of their
 
04:24:35.269 --> 04:24:35.279 align:start position:0%
abusers horrified her and she has worked
 
04:24:37.030 --> 04:24:37.040 align:start position:0%
ever since to put guard rails and
 
04:24:39.590 --> 04:24:39.600 align:start position:0%
protections around treatment the final
 
04:24:41.070 --> 04:24:41.080 align:start position:0%
words she said to the committee were
 
04:24:44.389 --> 04:24:44.399 align:start position:0%
these I've worked 11 years to create
 
04:24:46.349 --> 04:24:46.359 align:start position:0%
some kind of protection for those going
 
04:24:48.429 --> 04:24:48.439 align:start position:0%
through substance abuse treatment and
 
04:24:51.349 --> 04:24:51.359 align:start position:0%
this bill is the closest we have ever
 
04:24:55.109 --> 04:24:55.119 align:start position:0%
come Mr Speaker we owe it to her and all
 
04:24:56.590 --> 04:24:56.600 align:start position:0%
those navigating the very difficult
 
04:24:58.950 --> 04:24:58.960 align:start position:0%
journey to recovery to finally get this
 
04:25:01.910 --> 04:25:01.920 align:start position:0%
done there are those who oppose the bill
 
04:25:03.870 --> 04:25:03.880 align:start position:0%
as potentially creating unnecessary
 
04:25:06.229 --> 04:25:06.239 align:start position:0%
regulations but I just want to ensure
 
04:25:09.910 --> 04:25:09.920 align:start position:0%
them that I am a huge limited government
 
04:25:14.030 --> 04:25:14.040 align:start position:0%
guy huge but this is a clean bill and
 
04:25:16.630 --> 04:25:16.640 align:start position:0%
limited government does not mean no
 
04:25:18.950 --> 04:25:18.960 align:start position:0%
government without some rules in the
 
04:25:21.309 --> 04:25:21.319 align:start position:0%
Playbook those walking no waya out of
 
04:25:23.550 --> 04:25:23.560 align:start position:0%
addiction will continue to walk under
 
04:25:25.710 --> 04:25:25.720 align:start position:0%
the tyranny of the Predator the abuser
 
04:25:29.510 --> 04:25:29.520 align:start position:0%
and the Spectre of unnecessary relapse
 
04:25:31.750 --> 04:25:31.760 align:start position:0%
for those that walk this hard path this
 
04:25:34.349 --> 04:25:34.359 align:start position:0%
bill represents the release from tyranny
 
04:25:35.750 --> 04:25:35.760 align:start position:0%
and the freedom to walk through their
 
04:25:38.149 --> 04:25:38.159 align:start position:0%
recovery Journey without fear the mayor
 
04:25:41.670 --> 04:25:41.680 align:start position:0%
of Manchester himself a recovered addict
 
04:25:44.389 --> 04:25:44.399 align:start position:0%
talked to me about this bill he said you
 
04:25:46.630 --> 04:25:46.640 align:start position:0%
know Mark when you release someone from
 
04:25:49.750 --> 04:25:49.760 align:start position:0%
Valley Street jail and they are clean we
 
04:25:51.990 --> 04:25:52.000 align:start position:0%
have a rare opportunity to keep them
 
04:25:55.109 --> 04:25:55.119 align:start position:0%
that way and that opportunity is lost if
 
04:25:56.870 --> 04:25:56.880 align:start position:0%
they're placed in the counseling with
 
04:25:59.429 --> 04:25:59.439 align:start position:0%
someone who has not themselves completed
 
04:26:01.990 --> 04:26:02.000 align:start position:0%

Hampshire's children be healthy and

Thrive however childhood lead poisoning
 
04:29:51.550 --> 04:29:51.560 align:start position:0%
is on the rise in New Hampshire with
 
04:29:53.990 --> 04:29:54.000 align:start position:0%
nearly 5,000 New Hampshire children over
 
04:29:56.950 --> 04:29:56.960 align:start position:0%
the past 5 years having experienced
 
04:29:59.469 --> 04:29:59.479 align:start position:0%
elevated blood lead levels high enough
 
04:30:01.950 --> 04:30:01.960 align:start position:0%
to impair their ability to think
 
04:30:03.670 --> 04:30:03.680 align:start position:0%
concentrate and
 
04:30:06.429 --> 04:30:06.439 align:start position:0%
learn lead is a naturally occurring
 
04:30:09.990 --> 04:30:10.000 align:start position:0%
toxic metal and there is no known safe
 
04:30:12.309 --> 04:30:12.319 align:start position:0%
blood level concentration
 
04:30:14.109 --> 04:30:14.119 align:start position:0%
exposure to very high levels can
 
04:30:16.109 --> 04:30:16.119 align:start position:0%
severely damage the brain and central

nervous system causing coma convulsions
 
04:30:24.189 --> 04:30:24.199 align:start position:0%
and even death children who do
 
04:30:26.630 --> 04:30:26.640 align:start position:0%
survive may be left with permanent
 
04:30:28.990 --> 04:30:29.000 align:start position:0%
intellectual disability and behavioral
 
04:30:31.790 --> 04:30:31.800 align:start position:0%
disorders resulting in long-term
 
04:30:34.550 --> 04:30:34.560 align:start position:0%
significant costs for those individuals
 
04:30:37.070 --> 04:30:37.080 align:start position:0%
as well as their families communities
 
04:30:38.870 --> 04:30:38.880 align:start position:0%
and New Hampshire
 
04:30:41.429 --> 04:30:41.439 align:start position:0%
taxpayers New Hampshire has aging
 
04:30:43.670 --> 04:30:43.680 align:start position:0%
housing stock which puts our families at
 
04:30:47.830 --> 04:30:47.840 align:start position:0%
risk of lead poisoning as lead dust too
 
04:30:51.469 --> 04:30:51.479 align:start position:0%
tiny to see on hands toys or surfaces
 
04:30:54.269 --> 04:30:54.279 align:start position:0%
can have serious and permanent effects
 
04:30:57.269 --> 04:30:57.279 align:start position:0%
on a child's growth and development the
 
04:31:00.070 --> 04:31:00.080 align:start position:0%
only way to detect blood poisoning is
 
04:31:03.070 --> 04:31:03.080 align:start position:0%
through a simple blood test that is why
 
04:31:04.870 --> 04:31:04.880 align:start position:0%
all New Hampshire children should be
 
04:31:09.070 --> 04:31:09.080 align:start position:0%
tested at age 1 and again at age two
 
04:31:11.189 --> 04:31:11.199 align:start position:0%
during their well child check medical
 
04:31:11.199 --> 04:31:13.389 align:start position:0%
during their well child check medical
visits

04:31:13.389 --> 04:31:13.399 align:start position:0%
visits
 
04:31:16.109 --> 04:31:16.119 align:start position:0%
regly currently significant numbers of
 
04:31:19.349 --> 04:31:19.359 align:start position:0%
children are not tested at
 
04:31:22.269 --> 04:31:22.279 align:start position:0%
all given the potentially devastating
 
04:31:24.670 --> 04:31:24.680 align:start position:0%
impacts of lead on children's developing
 
04:31:27.309 --> 04:31:27.319 align:start position:0%
brains and the very concerning low
 
04:31:29.429 --> 04:31:29.439 align:start position:0%
numbers of one and two-year-old children
 
04:31:32.189 --> 04:31:32.199 align:start position:0%
currently tested for blood lead levels
 
04:31:34.590 --> 04:31:34.600 align:start position:0%
this bill provides an important stop Gap
 
04:31:37.189 --> 04:31:37.199 align:start position:0%
opportunity for increasing the blood
 
04:31:39.550 --> 04:31:39.560 align:start position:0%
testing of infants and
 
04:31:41.870 --> 04:31:41.880 align:start position:0%
children there are already health record
 
04:31:44.109 --> 04:31:44.119 align:start position:0%
records that have to be submitted when a
 
04:31:46.830 --> 04:31:46.840 align:start position:0%
child goes to daycare or starts public
 
04:31:49.950 --> 04:31:49.960 align:start position:0%
school this bill presents an important
 
04:31:51.830 --> 04:31:51.840 align:start position:0%
opportunity to lower the number of
 
04:31:53.750 --> 04:31:53.760 align:start position:0%
children who fall through the
 
04:31:56.790 --> 04:31:56.800 align:start position:0%
Gap adding a simple checkbox to the
 
04:31:59.990 --> 04:32:00.000 align:start position:0%
existing process provides one more
 
04:32:02.950 --> 04:32:02.960 align:start position:0%
opportunity for children to be tested to
 
04:32:04.870 --> 04:32:04.880 align:start position:0%
protect New Hampshire Children's Health
 
04:32:04.880 --> 04:32:05.590 align:start position:0%
protect New Hampshire Children's Health
and

04:32:05.590 --> 04:32:05.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:32:08.550 --> 04:32:08.560 align:start position:0%
well-being for this reason I strongly
 
04:32:12.510 --> 04:32:12.520 align:start position:0%
urge no on the motion of itl
 
04:32:16.149 --> 04:32:16.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:21.590 --> 04:32:21.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:24.389 --> 04:32:24.399 align:start position:0%
kofalt thank you Mr Speaker uh this bill
 
04:32:27.309 --> 04:32:27.319 align:start position:0%
adds a uh a step to the process of
 
04:32:31.109 --> 04:32:31.119 align:start position:0%
enrolling a child in school or
 
04:32:33.870 --> 04:32:33.880 align:start position:0%
daycare uh it doesn't actually add
 
04:32:35.469 --> 04:32:35.479 align:start position:0%
additional lead testing requirements we
 
04:32:37.910 --> 04:32:37.920 align:start position:0%
already require children to be tested at
 
04:32:40.830 --> 04:32:40.840 align:start position:0%
age one and then again at age
 
04:32:43.109 --> 04:32:43.119 align:start position:0%
two the reporting requirement really
 
04:32:45.349 --> 04:32:45.359 align:start position:0%
needs to be administered by the school
 
04:32:49.389 --> 04:32:49.399 align:start position:0%
or Child Care Agency so it is
 
04:32:52.950 --> 04:32:52.960 align:start position:0%
essentially um putting the burdens of of
 
04:32:54.990 --> 04:32:55.000 align:start position:0%
doing that on those organizations You
 
04:32:57.269 --> 04:32:57.279 align:start position:0%
could argue that's not a huge burden but
 
04:32:59.109 --> 04:32:59.119 align:start position:0%
there is also a notification requirement
 
04:33:00.309 --> 04:33:00.319 align:start position:0%
so they then have to send out a
 
04:33:03.709 --> 04:33:03.719 align:start position:0%
notification to parents um that this is
 
04:33:06.230 --> 04:33:06.240 align:start position:0%
required uh if the if the parent has not
 
04:33:08.230 --> 04:33:08.240 align:start position:0%
provided proof that the child has been
 
04:33:11.189 --> 04:33:11.199 align:start position:0%
tested um and once they provide that
 
04:33:13.109 --> 04:33:13.119 align:start position:0%
notification there doesn't appear to be
 
04:33:17.990 --> 04:33:18.000 align:start position:0%
any further um enforcement mechanism so
 
04:33:20.189 --> 04:33:20.199 align:start position:0%
um really we see this as as an
 
04:33:22.551 --> 04:33:22.561 align:start position:0%
unnecessary and burdensome Bill uh we
 
04:33:25.150 --> 04:33:25.160 align:start position:0%
already require lead testing and uh it
 
04:33:28.070 --> 04:33:28.080 align:start position:0%
places unnecessary burdens on uh schools
 
04:33:30.551 --> 04:33:30.561 align:start position:0%
and Child Care Centers so I urge my my
 
04:33:34.949 --> 04:33:34.959 align:start position:0%
colleagues uh to uh to support the itl
 
04:33:38.789 --> 04:33:38.799 align:start position:0%
motion roll call Mr Speaker Weber has
 
04:33:40.349 --> 04:33:40.359 align:start position:0%
asked for roll call is that sufficiently
 
04:33:42.949 --> 04:33:42.959 align:start position:0%
seconded it is sufficient seconded this
 
04:33:44.830 --> 04:33:44.840 align:start position:0%
will be a roll call vote members take
 
04:34:37.990 --> 04:34:38.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:39.629 --> 04:34:39.639 align:start position:0%
the motion before us is any expedience
 
04:34:41.910 --> 04:34:41.920 align:start position:0%
to legislate on House Bill 756 this is
 
04:34:44.029 --> 04:34:44.039 align:start position:0%
the roll call vote chair recognizes
 
04:34:46.990 --> 04:34:47.000 align:start position:0%
representative Weber for a parliamentary
 
04:34:49.830 --> 04:34:49.840 align:start position:0%
inquiry thank you Mr
 
04:34:53.629 --> 04:34:53.639 align:start position:0%
Speaker if I thought that not adding
 
04:34:56.750 --> 04:34:56.760 align:start position:0%
another mandate might be a good
 
04:35:00.230 --> 04:35:00.240 align:start position:0%
thing but if I know that blood level
 
04:35:03.230 --> 04:35:03.240 align:start position:0%
lead levels are rising in our children
 
04:35:06.709 --> 04:35:06.719 align:start position:0%
and testing is not keeping up and if I
 
04:35:09.869 --> 04:35:09.879 align:start position:0%
know that this just offers another
 
04:35:12.990 --> 04:35:13.000 align:start position:0%
opportunity to get people tested and
 
04:35:16.109 --> 04:35:16.119 align:start position:0%
treated for a horrible disease if
 
04:35:19.670 --> 04:35:19.680 align:start position:0%
necessary preventing further harm would
 
04:35:24.910 --> 04:35:24.920 align:start position:0%
I now press red on the itl so another
 
04:35:26.709 --> 04:35:26.719 align:start position:0%
motion can be
 
04:35:28.830 --> 04:35:28.840 align:start position:0%

inquiry thank you Mr
 
04:35:38.189 --> 04:35:38.199 align:start position:0%
Speaker Mr Speaker if I know that New
 
04:35:40.629 --> 04:35:40.639 align:start position:0%
Hampshire already requires children to
 
04:35:43.551 --> 04:35:43.561 align:start position:0%
be tested for LED at both ages one and
 
04:35:46.590 --> 04:35:46.600 align:start position:0%
Age Two and Mr Speaker if I know that
 
04:35:49.230 --> 04:35:49.240 align:start position:0%
this bill more than anything else simply
 
04:35:51.109 --> 04:35:51.119 align:start position:0%
imposes additional administrative
 
04:35:53.910 --> 04:35:53.920 align:start position:0%
burdens on Child Care Centers and
 
04:35:56.189 --> 04:35:56.199 align:start position:0%
schools Mr Speaker if I know these
 
04:35:57.629 --> 04:35:57.639 align:start position:0%

issue to this
 
04:39:07.949 --> 04:39:07.959 align:start position:0%
body uh I don't know if this is the
 
04:39:10.070 --> 04:39:10.080 align:start position:0%
sixth or seventh I'm not sure if this is
 
04:39:11.670 --> 04:39:11.680 align:start position:0%
the sixth or the seventh time that we've
 
04:39:13.910 --> 04:39:13.920 align:start position:0%
talked about this issue but for the
 
04:39:15.590 --> 04:39:15.600 align:start position:0%
benefit of the new members I'm going to
 
04:39:17.830 --> 04:39:17.840 align:start position:0%
go through some of the stories why I
 
04:39:19.349 --> 04:39:19.359 align:start position:0%
keep on bringing this
 
04:39:22.269 --> 04:39:22.279 align:start position:0%
back uh one of them involved an assisted
 
04:39:24.949 --> 04:39:24.959 align:start position:0%
living center in my town of New
 
04:39:29.551 --> 04:39:29.561 align:start position:0%
Market which uh the uh owner of the
 
04:39:33.390 --> 04:39:33.400 align:start position:0%
business sold the business right to
 
04:39:36.189 --> 04:39:36.199 align:start position:0%
do the member has a right to be heard
 
04:39:39.430 --> 04:39:39.440 align:start position:0%
and it's getting awful awful noisy in
 
04:39:43.470 --> 04:39:43.480 align:start position:0%
here thank you Mr continue uh the owner
 
04:39:46.230 --> 04:39:46.240 align:start position:0%
of this Assisted Living Center sold the
 
04:39:50.550 --> 04:39:50.560 align:start position:0%
business and five or several of the
 
04:39:52.830 --> 04:39:52.840 align:start position:0%
current employees transferred to the new
 
04:39:54.628 --> 04:39:54.638 align:start position:0%
owner they knew the jobs well they knew
 
04:39:56.910 --> 04:39:56.920 align:start position:0%
the patience and this was a good thing
 
04:39:56.920 --> 04:39:57.750 align:start position:0%
the patience and this was a good thing
for

04:39:57.750 --> 04:39:57.760 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:40:01.868 --> 04:40:01.878 align:start position:0%
both uh five of these people found that
 
04:40:04.550 --> 04:40:04.560 align:start position:0%
uh when they got their next paycheck
 
04:40:05.948 --> 04:40:05.958 align:start position:0%
from the new
 
04:40:09.708 --> 04:40:09.718 align:start position:0%
employer the uh the acred vacation was
 
04:40:12.470 --> 04:40:12.480 align:start position:0%
gone and there had been no payment from
 
04:40:15.628 --> 04:40:15.638 align:start position:0%
the previous employer for said hours so
 
04:40:17.470 --> 04:40:17.480 align:start position:0%
they filed the claim with the Department
 
04:40:19.590 --> 04:40:19.600 align:start position:0%
of Labor the New Hampshire Department of
 
04:40:22.350 --> 04:40:22.360 align:start position:0%
Labor and you and I might agree that
 
04:40:25.030 --> 04:40:25.040 align:start position:0%
something was wrong there and that when
 
04:40:28.750 --> 04:40:28.760 align:start position:0%
you do earn something your vacation time
 
04:40:32.110 --> 04:40:32.120 align:start position:0%
you earn it it belongs to you and while
 
04:40:34.230 --> 04:40:34.240 align:start position:0%
some companies may have a policy about
 
04:40:37.190 --> 04:40:37.200 align:start position:0%
use it or lose it you have amount of
 
04:40:38.708 --> 04:40:38.718 align:start position:0%
time with which you must use it and
 
04:40:40.550 --> 04:40:40.560 align:start position:0%
after that you lose some it doesn't all
 
04:40:41.910 --> 04:40:41.920 align:start position:0%
get carried over there's a lot of
 
04:40:45.030 --> 04:40:45.040 align:start position:0%
variety in this but in general and I
 
04:40:46.190 --> 04:40:46.200 align:start position:0%
don't know maybe you've experienced
 
04:40:48.550 --> 04:40:48.560 align:start position:0%
yourself in your own life where if your
 
04:40:50.670 --> 04:40:50.680 align:start position:0%
company changes hands it's required
 
04:40:52.990 --> 04:40:53.000 align:start position:0%
there's an acquisition normally what
 
04:40:55.070 --> 04:40:55.080 align:start position:0%
happens is you stay on everything's
 
04:40:56.868 --> 04:40:56.878 align:start position:0%
grandfathered over you don't lose
 
04:40:59.310 --> 04:40:59.320 align:start position:0%
anything that you once again you've
 
04:41:02.310 --> 04:41:02.320 align:start position:0%
earned it in this case that's not what
 
04:41:05.708 --> 04:41:05.718 align:start position:0%
happened and because they the employer's
 
04:41:09.230 --> 04:41:09.240 align:start position:0%
policy was uh upon upon
 
04:41:11.788 --> 04:41:11.798 align:start position:0%
termination uh vacation has not
 
04:41:15.430 --> 04:41:15.440 align:start position:0%
p no this way that way no circumstances
 
04:41:17.788 --> 04:41:17.798 align:start position:0%
just upon termination even though it was
 
04:41:21.070 --> 04:41:21.080 align:start position:0%
the employer's decision to do it and I
 
04:41:22.470 --> 04:41:22.480 align:start position:0%
have no quarrel with him selling the
 
04:41:24.948 --> 04:41:24.958 align:start position:0%
business it's his right to do so I just
 
04:41:26.310 --> 04:41:26.320 align:start position:0%
think he should have taken better care
 
04:41:29.350 --> 04:41:29.360 align:start position:0%
of his employees in one way or the
 
04:41:32.230 --> 04:41:32.240 align:start position:0%
other uh the other story I'm going to
 
04:41:33.670 --> 04:41:33.680 align:start position:0%
tell you because they these of these
 
04:41:34.948 --> 04:41:34.958 align:start position:0%
people there were five of them five
 
04:41:37.110 --> 04:41:37.120 align:start position:0%
claims they lost you know $ four or $500
 
04:41:39.910 --> 04:41:39.920 align:start position:0%
a piece and this is 2014 when that was
 
04:41:42.230 --> 04:41:42.240 align:start position:0%
real money
 
04:41:44.948 --> 04:41:44.958 align:start position:0%
um another story is someone I knew who
 
04:41:46.990 --> 04:41:47.000 align:start position:0%
worked as a shipper for a computer
 
04:41:49.270 --> 04:41:49.280 align:start position:0%
company sort of a salvage computer
 
04:41:50.628 --> 04:41:50.638 align:start position:0%
company a lot of those popped up when
 
04:41:52.030 --> 04:41:52.040 align:start position:0%
everybody was buying
 
04:41:54.750 --> 04:41:54.760 align:start position:0%
computers and she was a shipper and she
 
04:41:56.390 --> 04:41:56.400 align:start position:0%
would you know dutifully ship the
 
04:41:59.708 --> 04:41:59.718 align:start position:0%
product and get it done and then the
 
04:42:02.150 --> 04:42:02.160 align:start position:0%
policy in that and this she had two she
 
04:42:03.788 --> 04:42:03.798 align:start position:0%
if you had vacation time and you wanted
 
04:42:06.030 --> 04:42:06.040 align:start position:0%
to have a take the vacation you needed
 
04:42:08.030 --> 04:42:08.040 align:start position:0%
to ask the manager two weeks ahead of
 
04:42:10.030 --> 04:42:10.040 align:start position:0%
time which is reasonable to say because
 
04:42:11.270 --> 04:42:11.280 align:start position:0%
you know they have to allow for the
 
04:42:13.628 --> 04:42:13.638 align:start position:0%
business to move forward someone to take
 
04:42:16.030 --> 04:42:16.040 align:start position:0%
over that job while you're away on
 
04:42:19.590 --> 04:42:19.600 align:start position:0%
vacation so she had three weeks of
 
04:42:22.190 --> 04:42:22.200 align:start position:0%
vacation H but when she went in that
 
04:42:24.070 --> 04:42:24.080 align:start position:0%
when she went into work one day not
 
04:42:26.110 --> 04:42:26.120 align:start position:0%
knowing that this was going to happen
 
04:42:29.628 --> 04:42:29.638 align:start position:0%
she was laid off so because she was
 
04:42:33.590 --> 04:42:33.600 align:start position:0%
unable to give two weeks uh request a
 
04:42:36.788 --> 04:42:36.798 align:start position:0%
vacation two weeks in advance she lost
 
04:42:39.550 --> 04:42:39.560 align:start position:0%
all that wage equivalent which is
 
04:42:42.070 --> 04:42:42.080 align:start position:0%
$2,300 in change
 
04:42:43.868 --> 04:42:43.878 align:start position:0%
now I think most of us could agree that
 
04:42:46.390 --> 04:42:46.400 align:start position:0%
that was not right that you know she had
 
04:42:48.708 --> 04:42:48.718 align:start position:0%
no control over the decision she had she
 
04:42:51.030 --> 04:42:51.040 align:start position:0%
hadn't done anything wrong she I think
 
04:42:53.470 --> 04:42:53.480 align:start position:0%
she worked there for seven years or so
 
04:42:56.310 --> 04:42:56.320 align:start position:0%
and so why should she lose what she had
 
04:42:58.990 --> 04:42:59.000 align:start position:0%
earned but that's what
 
04:42:59.000 --> 04:43:00.670 align:start position:0%
earned but that's what
happened

04:43:00.670 --> 04:43:00.680 align:start position:0%
happened
 
04:43:03.670 --> 04:43:03.680 align:start position:0%
um I'm going to tell you another
 
04:43:05.788 --> 04:43:05.798 align:start position:0%
story I'm not I'm I'm not going to go on
 
04:43:07.310 --> 04:43:07.320 align:start position:0%
much longer with the stories but they're
 
04:43:08.430 --> 04:43:08.440 align:start position:0%
all kind of
 
04:43:10.310 --> 04:43:10.320 align:start position:0%
interesting um you know because when
 
04:43:12.230 --> 04:43:12.240 align:start position:0%
nowadays we have so many people working
 
04:43:14.310 --> 04:43:14.320 align:start position:0%
remotely maybe you know people that are
 
04:43:19.350 --> 04:43:19.360 align:start position:0%
doing that and there's a woman who uh
 
04:43:20.628 --> 04:43:20.638 align:start position:0%
had a
 
04:43:23.628 --> 04:43:23.638 align:start position:0%
job uh she was working from home but
 
04:43:26.070 --> 04:43:26.080 align:start position:0%
working for an employer and she was
 
04:43:27.830 --> 04:43:27.840 align:start position:0%
there about three and a half
 
04:43:32.190 --> 04:43:32.200 align:start position:0%
years and their policy had been up
 
04:43:35.990 --> 04:43:36.000 align:start position:0%
until up until November of 23 the policy
 
04:43:39.310 --> 04:43:39.320 align:start position:0%
had been when you leave you give notice
 
04:43:41.390 --> 04:43:41.400 align:start position:0%
and you work your notice we will pay you
 
04:43:44.868 --> 04:43:44.878 align:start position:0%
your your time that was the policy but
 
04:43:48.510 --> 04:43:48.520 align:start position:0%
in November of 23 uh it changed to we
 
04:43:51.830 --> 04:43:51.840 align:start position:0%
will pay you your time if the law if the
 
04:43:53.670 --> 04:43:53.680 align:start position:0%
state in which you live requires us to
 
04:43:55.788 --> 04:43:55.798 align:start position:0%
do it so there are people who will do
 
04:43:57.150 --> 04:43:57.160 align:start position:0%
what they can and there's people who do
 
04:44:01.190 --> 04:44:01.200 align:start position:0%
what they have to do so in this case uh
 
04:44:04.110 --> 04:44:04.120 align:start position:0%
she filed the wage claim and because she
 
04:44:06.150 --> 04:44:06.160 align:start position:0%
lived in New Hampshire which does not
 
04:44:08.550 --> 04:44:08.560 align:start position:0%
have that protection I guess I'd call
 
04:44:11.190 --> 04:44:11.200 align:start position:0%
this the New Hampshire disadvantage uh
 
04:44:13.390 --> 04:44:13.400 align:start position:0%
she did not have that protection and she
 
04:44:16.628 --> 04:44:16.638 align:start position:0%
lost some uh uh
 
04:44:19.948 --> 04:44:19.958 align:start position:0%
$1,200 and that's in this year's
 
04:44:19.958 --> 04:44:21.470 align:start position:0%
$1,200 and that's in this year's
money

04:44:21.470 --> 04:44:21.480 align:start position:0%
money
 
04:44:26.550 --> 04:44:26.560 align:start position:0%
um so what this bill does what this bill
 
04:44:27.830 --> 04:44:27.840 align:start position:0%
does is it
 
04:44:32.590 --> 04:44:32.600 align:start position:0%
says um if you if you are laid off if
 
04:44:36.110 --> 04:44:36.120 align:start position:0%
your company is sold or it goes out of
 
04:44:39.470 --> 04:44:39.480 align:start position:0%
business you will get paid what you have
 
04:44:41.310 --> 04:44:41.320 align:start position:0%
accured there's because because there's
 
04:44:43.750 --> 04:44:43.760 align:start position:0%
a lot of variety in the way companies do
 
04:44:47.070 --> 04:44:47.080 align:start position:0%
this some have the acral system which
 
04:44:49.270 --> 04:44:49.280 align:start position:0%
was more common when I was working and
 
04:44:51.788 --> 04:44:51.798 align:start position:0%
some to well it's all One bank it's all
 
04:44:54.350 --> 04:44:54.360 align:start position:0%
PTO and this this seems to cause a
 
04:44:57.270 --> 04:44:57.280 align:start position:0%
problem for some because I said um you
 
04:44:59.070 --> 04:44:59.080 align:start position:0%
don't have to pay the sick time because
 
04:45:00.550 --> 04:45:00.560 align:start position:0%
we don't want you to get sick but if you
 
04:45:02.788 --> 04:45:02.798 align:start position:0%
do get sick we're going to pay you for
 
04:45:04.110 --> 04:45:04.120 align:start position:0%
that day because we didn't want you to
 
04:45:05.510 --> 04:45:05.520 align:start position:0%
come in and give it to everybody else we
 
04:45:08.110 --> 04:45:08.120 align:start position:0%
hope you feel better but a vacation
 
04:45:09.750 --> 04:45:09.760 align:start position:0%
you've earned it we expect you to take
 
04:45:12.470 --> 04:45:12.480 align:start position:0%
the vacation we don't expect to to uh
 
04:45:15.670 --> 04:45:15.680 align:start position:0%
keep that money under any circumstances
 
04:45:17.670 --> 04:45:17.680 align:start position:0%
we expect you to be rested and take the
 
04:45:20.868 --> 04:45:20.878 align:start position:0%
vacation so some people find that
 
04:45:22.788 --> 04:45:22.798 align:start position:0%
because they say it's
 
04:45:25.788 --> 04:45:25.798 align:start position:0%
PTO um all One bank if you said that in
 
04:45:27.310 --> 04:45:27.320 align:start position:0%
the beginning that's you should leave it
 
04:45:29.110 --> 04:45:29.120 align:start position:0%
that way you don't have to take it all
 
04:45:31.230 --> 04:45:31.240 align:start position:0%
apart and try to reverse reverse the
 
04:45:33.430 --> 04:45:33.440 align:start position:0%
problem it's it's not not complicated at
 
04:45:35.990 --> 04:45:36.000 align:start position:0%
all whatever you said it was if it's all
 
04:45:37.948 --> 04:45:37.958 align:start position:0%
One Bank you don't have to worry about
 
04:45:40.750 --> 04:45:40.760 align:start position:0%
the V the sick days just pay them cuz
 
04:45:41.910 --> 04:45:41.920 align:start position:0%
that's what you said you were going to
 
04:45:44.910 --> 04:45:44.920 align:start position:0%
do but you should pay them if they if
 
04:45:47.788 --> 04:45:47.798 align:start position:0%
they leave and it's beyond their control
 
04:45:49.550 --> 04:45:49.560 align:start position:0%
it's because you had a lay off maybe
 
04:45:51.550 --> 04:45:51.560 align:start position:0%
something's changed in the company you
 
04:45:52.670 --> 04:45:52.680 align:start position:0%
you know you don't need that person
 
04:45:54.230 --> 04:45:54.240 align:start position:0%
you're going to need a different person
 
04:45:56.390 --> 04:45:56.400 align:start position:0%
you lay that person off and what's he
 
04:45:58.070 --> 04:45:58.080 align:start position:0%
going to do he's going to go collect
 
04:45:59.830 --> 04:45:59.840 align:start position:0%
unemployment and when he collects
 
04:46:01.510 --> 04:46:01.520 align:start position:0%
unemployment they're going to say did
 
04:46:02.948 --> 04:46:02.958 align:start position:0%
you get any severance pay you have any
 
04:46:04.708 --> 04:46:04.718 align:start position:0%
vacation pay and if he does have
 
04:46:07.430 --> 04:46:07.440 align:start position:0%
vacation pay that gets reduced so he's
 
04:46:09.830 --> 04:46:09.840 align:start position:0%
not getting paid until he's used that
 
04:46:11.670 --> 04:46:11.680 align:start position:0%
Severance or vacation pay we're
 
04:46:13.788 --> 04:46:13.798 align:start position:0%
protecting the uh the trust fund so
 
04:46:15.788 --> 04:46:15.798 align:start position:0%
there's a number of good reasons other
 
04:46:17.948 --> 04:46:17.958 align:start position:0%
than the moral one that it's the right
 
04:46:19.868 --> 04:46:19.878 align:start position:0%
thing to do and many of you if you have
 
04:46:21.910 --> 04:46:21.920 align:start position:0%
been an employer I'm sure you would you
 
04:46:23.230 --> 04:46:23.240 align:start position:0%
would take care of your people and not
 
04:46:24.590 --> 04:46:24.600 align:start position:0%
just say well I'll just put this money
 
04:46:27.270 --> 04:46:27.280 align:start position:0%
in my pocket
 
04:46:30.030 --> 04:46:30.040 align:start position:0%
so um I want to draw your attention to
 
04:46:32.390 --> 04:46:32.400 align:start position:0%
the committee report by my good friend
 
04:46:32.400 --> 04:46:33.510 align:start position:0%
the committee report by my good friend
from

04:46:33.510 --> 04:46:33.520 align:start position:0%
from
 
04:46:36.270 --> 04:46:36.280 align:start position:0%
Hudson in which he says that it will
 
04:46:40.190 --> 04:46:40.200 align:start position:0%
require employers to change what they're
 
04:46:42.628 --> 04:46:42.638 align:start position:0%
doing and it really doesn't it just
 
04:46:46.230 --> 04:46:46.240 align:start position:0%
says if you if you have PTO it's really
 
04:46:48.788 --> 04:46:48.798 align:start position:0%
all just PTO it's under this this bill
 
04:46:50.788 --> 04:46:50.798 align:start position:0%
is under very very limited narrow
 
04:46:52.788 --> 04:46:52.798 align:start position:0%
circumstances not somebody who just
 
04:46:54.150 --> 04:46:54.160 align:start position:0%
walks in and quits and leaves the
 
04:46:56.110 --> 04:46:56.120 align:start position:0%
employer short like that this is really
 
04:47:00.270 --> 04:47:00.280 align:start position:0%
a very narrow and uh practical Bill and
 
04:47:02.788 --> 04:47:02.798 align:start position:0%
since we want to treat our employer
 
04:47:04.628 --> 04:47:04.638 align:start position:0%
employees as well as we in treat
 
04:47:08.390 --> 04:47:08.400 align:start position:0%
employers I urge you to defeat the
 
04:47:11.548 --> 04:47:11.558 align:start position:0%
itl and uh give us another opportunity
 
04:47:15.270 --> 04:47:15.280 align:start position:0%
to uh pass this bill uh I remind I'm
 
04:47:17.070 --> 04:47:17.080 align:start position:0%
reminded that my good friend from Hudson
 
04:47:19.590 --> 04:47:19.600 align:start position:0%
himself Works in a company Massachusetts
 
04:47:21.270 --> 04:47:21.280 align:start position:0%
and has benefited from the law that they
 
04:47:23.510 --> 04:47:23.520 align:start position:0%
have there and I wish he would extend
 
04:47:24.868 --> 04:47:24.878 align:start position:0%
that benefit to the people of New
 
04:47:26.990 --> 04:47:27.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire thank you Mr
 
04:47:37.030 --> 04:47:37.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:39.830 --> 04:47:39.840 align:start position:0%
proud we'll find
 
04:47:43.470 --> 04:47:43.480 align:start position:0%
out thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker this
 
04:47:45.910 --> 04:47:45.920 align:start position:0%
bill would add several new requirements
 
04:47:47.548 --> 04:47:47.558 align:start position:0%
onto businesses regarding employee
 
04:47:49.868 --> 04:47:49.878 align:start position:0%
vacation time specifically written
 
04:47:52.390 --> 04:47:52.400 align:start position:0%
policies with specific items and require
 
04:47:54.270 --> 04:47:54.280 align:start position:0%
new internal processes that must meet
 
04:47:56.670 --> 04:47:56.680 align:start position:0%
specific requirements it strictly
 
04:47:58.350 --> 04:47:58.360 align:start position:0%
defines different types of time off
 
04:48:00.670 --> 04:48:00.680 align:start position:0%
vacation versus sick time in ways that
 
04:48:02.190 --> 04:48:02.200 align:start position:0%
do not necessarily comport with how
 
04:48:05.070 --> 04:48:05.080 align:start position:0%
businesses operate today in short it
 
04:48:07.150 --> 04:48:07.160 align:start position:0%
reduces the flexibility of employers to
 
04:48:08.868 --> 04:48:08.878 align:start position:0%
manage the relationship with their
 
04:48:11.548 --> 04:48:11.558 align:start position:0%
employees forcing this one Siz fits-all
 
04:48:13.510 --> 04:48:13.520 align:start position:0%
model with non-compliance traps that
 
04:48:16.150 --> 04:48:16.160 align:start position:0%
businesses get in trouble uh and will
 
04:48:19.470 --> 04:48:19.480 align:start position:0%
add extra expenses and burdens to small
 
04:48:22.030 --> 04:48:22.040 align:start position:0%
businesses the requirements of this bill
 
04:48:24.070 --> 04:48:24.080 align:start position:0%
can mostly be avoided by a business
 
04:48:25.830 --> 04:48:25.840 align:start position:0%
adopting an unfavorable vacation time
 
04:48:27.590 --> 04:48:27.600 align:start position:0%
expiration policy that focuses on
 
04:48:29.868 --> 04:48:29.878 align:start position:0%
protecting the business a recommendation
 
04:48:31.910 --> 04:48:31.920 align:start position:0%
I'm sure many business owners will
 
04:48:34.070 --> 04:48:34.080 align:start position:0%
receive I've experienced this personally
 
04:48:35.750 --> 04:48:35.760 align:start position:0%
when I Massachusetts adopted similar
 
04:48:38.030 --> 04:48:38.040 align:start position:0%
changes to their sick time laws my
 
04:48:39.510 --> 04:48:39.520 align:start position:0%
employer drastically changed their
 
04:48:41.230 --> 04:48:41.240 align:start position:0%
policies to comply and none of the
 
04:48:43.510 --> 04:48:43.520 align:start position:0%
changes were better for the
 
04:48:45.868 --> 04:48:45.878 align:start position:0%
employees additionally this bill applies
 
04:48:48.190 --> 04:48:48.200 align:start position:0%
retroactively it would apply not just a
 
04:48:50.030 --> 04:48:50.040 align:start position:0%
vacation time earned in the future but
 
04:48:52.030 --> 04:48:52.040 align:start position:0%
also existing vacation time or earned
 
04:48:53.750 --> 04:48:53.760 align:start position:0%
time already granted to existing
 
04:48:55.590 --> 04:48:55.600 align:start position:0%
employees however that may have been
 
04:48:57.910 --> 04:48:57.920 align:start position:0%
defined in the past businesses that
 
04:48:59.628 --> 04:48:59.638 align:start position:0%
aren't paying careful attention to the
 
04:49:01.070 --> 04:49:01.080 align:start position:0%
changes in the law may get caught
 
04:49:02.708 --> 04:49:02.718 align:start position:0%
unaware and see significant new
 
04:49:04.230 --> 04:49:04.240 align:start position:0%
liabilities suddenly show up on their
 
04:49:04.240 --> 04:49:05.110 align:start position:0%
liabilities suddenly show up on their
balance

04:49:05.110 --> 04:49:05.120 align:start position:0%
balance
 
04:49:08.070 --> 04:49:08.080 align:start position:0%
sheet finally existing laws allow the
 
04:49:09.510 --> 04:49:09.520 align:start position:0%
Department of Labor to investigate
 
04:49:10.830 --> 04:49:10.840 align:start position:0%
claims that businesses have not not
 
04:49:12.510 --> 04:49:12.520 align:start position:0%
follow their own vacation policies and
 
04:49:14.868 --> 04:49:14.878 align:start position:0%
take enforcement actions in the majority
 
04:49:17.868 --> 04:49:17.878 align:start position:0%
of cases this bill isn't needed thank
 
04:49:19.470 --> 04:49:19.480 align:start position:0%

Speaker Mr
 
04:51:42.350 --> 04:51:42.360 align:start position:0%
Speaker if I know that hb3 78 only
 
04:51:44.628 --> 04:51:44.638 align:start position:0%
requires the payment of earned unused
 
04:51:47.628 --> 04:51:47.638 align:start position:0%
time when it's due to a layoff a
 
04:51:50.350 --> 04:51:50.360 align:start position:0%
business closure or the sale of a
 
04:51:52.670 --> 04:51:52.680 align:start position:0%
business and further if I know that
 
04:51:54.190 --> 04:51:54.200 align:start position:0%
these circumstances are beyond the
 
04:51:56.788 --> 04:51:56.798 align:start position:0%
control of the employee who as a result
 
04:51:58.948 --> 04:51:58.958 align:start position:0%
has no opportunity to request the use of
 
04:52:01.830 --> 04:52:01.840 align:start position:0%
that earned time would I now press the
 
04:52:04.910 --> 04:52:04.920 align:start position:0%
red button to overturn the itl motion so
 
04:52:07.590 --> 04:52:07.600 align:start position:0%
another motion might be made thank you
 
04:52:09.230 --> 04:52:09.240 align:start position:0%
chair recognize represent a proud for
 
04:52:12.230 --> 04:52:12.240 align:start position:0%
parliamentary inquiry
 
04:52:13.430 --> 04:52:13.440 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr
 
04:52:15.510 --> 04:52:15.520 align:start position:0%
Speaker if I know that this bill would
 
04:52:18.070 --> 04:52:18.080 align:start position:0%
add new burdens on businesses and if I
 
04:52:20.390 --> 04:52:20.400 align:start position:0%
know that the one-size fits-all model
 
04:52:22.310 --> 04:52:22.320 align:start position:0%
for vacation time earn time and sick
 
04:52:24.230 --> 04:52:24.240 align:start position:0%
time envisioned by this bill does not
 
04:52:25.830 --> 04:52:25.840 align:start position:0%
comport with the actual practices of
 
04:52:27.708 --> 04:52:27.718 align:start position:0%
many businesses forcing them to change
 
04:52:29.670 --> 04:52:29.680 align:start position:0%
their policies in reaction to this
 
04:52:32.190 --> 04:52:32.200 align:start position:0%
law and if I also know this law would
 
04:52:34.590 --> 04:52:34.600 align:start position:0%
encourage businesses to adopt policies
 
04:52:36.868 --> 04:52:36.878 align:start position:0%
unfavorable to the employees to protect
 
04:52:38.990 --> 04:52:39.000 align:start position:0%
themselves and if I know that existing
 
04:52:40.510 --> 04:52:40.520 align:start position:0%
law allows the Department of Labor to
 
04:52:42.030 --> 04:52:42.040 align:start position:0%
investigate alleged violation of
 
04:52:43.470 --> 04:52:43.480 align:start position:0%
vacation time policies and take
 
04:52:45.750 --> 04:52:45.760 align:start position:0%
enforcement action making this law
 
04:52:48.510 --> 04:52:48.520 align:start position:0%
unnecessary in most cases would I now
 
04:52:52.628 --> 04:52:52.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:56.070 --> 04:52:56.080 align:start position:0%

Pearson thank you Mr
 
04:57:51.470 --> 04:57:51.480 align:start position:0%
Speaker The Minority Report on the
 
04:57:53.868 --> 04:57:53.878 align:start position:0%
committee on this bill pointed to some
 
04:57:55.910 --> 04:57:55.920 align:start position:0%
language in the original Bill my
 
04:57:57.948 --> 04:57:57.958 align:start position:0%
original bill that would place an
 
04:58:00.230 --> 04:58:00.240 align:start position:0%
unreasonable burden on assessors who may
 
04:58:02.948 --> 04:58:02.958 align:start position:0%
lack the necessary time or
 
04:58:06.868 --> 04:58:06.878 align:start position:0%
expertise I agree and so the amendment
 
04:58:08.910 --> 04:58:08.920 align:start position:0%
before you takes out that whole
 
04:58:11.948 --> 04:58:11.958 align:start position:0%
paragraph it is a bit convoluted it is a
 
04:58:14.230 --> 04:58:14.240 align:start position:0%
bit Technical and I had a good talk with
 
04:58:15.990 --> 04:58:16.000 align:start position:0%
myself I should write better language
 
04:58:19.070 --> 04:58:19.080 align:start position:0%
than that so with the passage of the
 
04:58:22.830 --> 04:58:22.840 align:start position:0%
amendment we're down to one very simple
 
04:58:26.590 --> 04:58:26.600 align:start position:0%
thing until maybe 70 years ago most
 
04:58:30.350 --> 04:58:30.360 align:start position:0%
churches had parsonages or rectories or
 
04:58:33.070 --> 04:58:33.080 align:start position:0%
vicarages right next to the church
 
04:58:35.230 --> 04:58:35.240 align:start position:0%
that's where the clergy member lived and
 
04:58:37.350 --> 04:58:37.360 align:start position:0%
everybody knew you don't tax that
 
04:58:39.030 --> 04:58:39.040 align:start position:0%
property it's part of the
 
04:58:42.948 --> 04:58:42.958 align:start position:0%
church well along the way people started
 
04:58:44.788 --> 04:58:44.798 align:start position:0%
uh having some second thoughts about the
 
04:58:47.310 --> 04:58:47.320 align:start position:0%
wisdom of this for example the clergy
 
04:58:49.350 --> 04:58:49.360 align:start position:0%
member lives in this
 
04:58:52.070 --> 04:58:52.080 align:start position:0%
property until retirement but there's no
 
04:58:55.510 --> 04:58:55.520 align:start position:0%
equity built up and secondly what if the
 
04:58:58.910 --> 04:58:58.920 align:start position:0%
clergy family want to paint the bedroom
 
04:59:01.350 --> 04:59:01.360 align:start position:0%
green but the church committee who owns
 
04:59:04.310 --> 04:59:04.320 align:start position:0%
the building wants to paint it purple
 
04:59:06.390 --> 04:59:06.400 align:start position:0%
what was birthed at that point was
 
04:59:10.150 --> 04:59:10.160 align:start position:0%
called a housing allowance you take the
 
04:59:12.788 --> 04:59:12.798 align:start position:0%
equivalent of living there utilities and
 
04:59:15.390 --> 04:59:15.400 align:start position:0%
so on and make a payment to the clergy
 
04:59:18.990 --> 04:59:19.000 align:start position:0%
member who can then go work to buy a
 
04:59:22.230 --> 04:59:22.240 align:start position:0%
property of his or her own it'll be
 
04:59:25.190 --> 04:59:25.200 align:start position:0%
their home they can design it the way
 
04:59:28.150 --> 04:59:28.160 align:start position:0%
they want and what the housing allowance
 
04:59:31.590 --> 04:59:31.600 align:start position:0%
will do is help the mortgage payments it
 
04:59:35.350 --> 04:59:35.360 align:start position:0%
will help the utilities and it will pay
 
04:59:35.360 --> 04:59:36.548 align:start position:0%
will help the utilities and it will pay
property

04:59:36.548 --> 04:59:36.558 align:start position:0%
property
 
04:59:38.830 --> 04:59:38.840 align:start position:0%
tax well what do you do with the old
 
04:59:38.840 --> 04:59:40.590 align:start position:0%
tax well what do you do with the old
parsonage

04:59:40.590 --> 04:59:40.600 align:start position:0%
parsonage
 
04:59:43.190 --> 04:59:43.200 align:start position:0%
a lot of churches rented it out and they
 
04:59:45.750 --> 04:59:45.760 align:start position:0%
took the money from that rental and used
 
04:59:48.150 --> 04:59:48.160 align:start position:0%
it for the clergy housing
 
04:59:51.110 --> 04:59:51.120 align:start position:0%
allowance the parsonage even though it's
 
04:59:54.390 --> 04:59:54.400 align:start position:0%
rented out is real estate taxfree as
 
04:59:57.590 --> 04:59:57.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:00.230 --> 05:00:00.240 align:start position:0%
been well that was the arrangement
 
05:00:02.390 --> 05:00:02.400 align:start position:0%
that's what I've known in places where
 
05:00:04.948 --> 05:00:04.958 align:start position:0%
I've lived that's where lots of my
 
05:00:07.628 --> 05:00:07.638 align:start position:0%
colleagues know in different states
 
05:00:10.750 --> 05:00:10.760 align:start position:0%
across the political color spectrum
 
05:00:13.868 --> 05:00:13.878 align:start position:0%
but why this bill two or three years ago
 
05:00:16.910 --> 05:00:16.920 align:start position:0%
there was a court case in New Hampshire
 
05:00:20.230 --> 05:00:20.240 align:start position:0%
it's arguable that a certain Church
 
05:00:23.350 --> 05:00:23.360 align:start position:0%
owned a lot of property and they got a
 
05:00:26.270 --> 05:00:26.280 align:start position:0%
lot of money for it and they claim they
 
05:00:28.628 --> 05:00:28.638 align:start position:0%
didn't have to pay real estate tax on
 
05:00:32.150 --> 05:00:32.160 align:start position:0%
any of that well that's not fair the
 
05:00:35.430 --> 05:00:35.440 align:start position:0%
second wealthiest religious organization
 
05:00:37.708 --> 05:00:37.718 align:start position:0%
in the world is Trinity Episcopal Church
 
05:00:41.430 --> 05:00:41.440 align:start position:0%
Wall Street they own the buildings on
 
05:00:44.030 --> 05:00:44.040 align:start position:0%
Wall Street and they pay massive real
 
05:00:46.190 --> 05:00:46.200 align:start position:0%
estate taxes because that isn't their
 
05:00:49.270 --> 05:00:49.280 align:start position:0%
mission that's just
 
05:00:53.548 --> 05:00:53.558 align:start position:0%
income so with overreach a town
 
05:00:56.628 --> 05:00:56.638 align:start position:0%
complained the church fought back the
 
05:00:59.150 --> 05:00:59.160 align:start position:0%
court said no the town is right and I
 
05:01:02.310 --> 05:01:02.320 align:start position:0%
would agree so since then different
 
05:01:04.750 --> 05:01:04.760 align:start position:0%
towns across the state have hired
 
05:01:07.430 --> 05:01:07.440 align:start position:0%
organizations to say help us take a look
 
05:01:11.430 --> 05:01:11.440 align:start position:0%
at the whole real estate tax exempt
 
05:01:14.230 --> 05:01:14.240 align:start position:0%
structure and different decisions were
 
05:01:16.670 --> 05:01:16.680 align:start position:0%
made I get a real estate tax bill I had
 
05:01:20.470 --> 05:01:20.480 align:start position:0%
to pay it was refunded but along the way
 
05:01:21.548 --> 05:01:21.558 align:start position:0%
there was
 
05:01:24.110 --> 05:01:24.120 align:start position:0%
confusion so a numbers of churches and
 
05:01:26.390 --> 05:01:26.400 align:start position:0%
numbers of towns have said to me why
 
05:01:29.430 --> 05:01:29.440 align:start position:0%
don't we put in law what had previously
 
05:01:31.948 --> 05:01:31.958 align:start position:0%
been a an agreement that everybody
 
05:01:35.070 --> 05:01:35.080 align:start position:0%
understood the amendment strips out all
 
05:01:37.270 --> 05:01:37.280 align:start position:0%
the confusing language I wrote and
 
05:01:42.470 --> 05:01:42.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:42.480 --> 05:01:44.230 align:start position:0%
 
rental

05:01:44.230 --> 05:01:44.240 align:start position:0%
rental
 
05:01:46.948 --> 05:01:46.958 align:start position:0%
policy that does what had been done for
 
05:01:50.990 --> 05:01:51.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:54.030 --> 05:01:54.040 align:start position:0%

05:09:04.270 --> 05:09:04.280 align:start position:0%
Speaker I Rise an opposition to the
 
05:09:05.948 --> 05:09:05.958 align:start position:0%
committee recommendation of about to
 
05:09:08.350 --> 05:09:08.360 align:start position:0%
pass as amended on HB
 
05:09:11.350 --> 05:09:11.360 align:start position:0%
617 bill that seeks to raise the allowed
 
05:09:13.830 --> 05:09:13.840 align:start position:0%
amount of New Hampshire's homestead
 
05:09:16.270 --> 05:09:16.280 align:start position:0%
exemption first I want to say that I
 
05:09:19.150 --> 05:09:19.160 align:start position:0%
believe this exemption badly needs to be
 
05:09:21.590 --> 05:09:21.600 align:start position:0%
raised given the rate of increase in
 
05:09:23.910 --> 05:09:23.920 align:start position:0%
home values in New Hampshire it's time
 
05:09:26.910 --> 05:09:26.920 align:start position:0%
we provided more relief for homeowners
 
05:09:29.110 --> 05:09:29.120 align:start position:0%
in dire Financial Straits who seek
 
05:09:30.430 --> 05:09:30.440 align:start position:0%
relief from
 
05:09:33.070 --> 05:09:33.080 align:start position:0%
creditors and had the bill proposed to
 
05:09:35.150 --> 05:09:35.160 align:start position:0%
raise the exemption from its current
 
05:09:36.868 --> 05:09:36.878 align:start position:0%
rate of
 
05:09:39.910 --> 05:09:39.920 align:start position:0%
120,000 to 150,000
 
05:09:39.920 --> 05:09:40.948 align:start position:0%
120,000 to 150,000
even

05:09:40.948 --> 05:09:40.958 align:start position:0%
even
 
05:09:44.628 --> 05:09:44.638 align:start position:0%
175,000 or more for individuals and
 
05:09:47.708 --> 05:09:47.718 align:start position:0%
twice that amount for married couples I
 
05:09:50.270 --> 05:09:50.280 align:start position:0%
can say with some degree of certainty
 
05:09:51.948 --> 05:09:51.958 align:start position:0%
that it would have sailed through our
 
05:09:54.070 --> 05:09:54.080 align:start position:0%
committee with the unanimous ought to
 
05:09:55.470 --> 05:09:55.480 align:start position:0%
pass a
 
05:09:58.830 --> 05:09:58.840 align:start position:0%
vote but for reasons many of us couldn't
 
05:10:02.350 --> 05:10:02.360 align:start position:0%
understand HB 617 seeks to raise the
 
05:10:04.030 --> 05:10:04.040 align:start position:0%
number almost
 
05:10:07.590 --> 05:10:07.600 align:start position:0%
tenfold to a whopping $1
 
05:10:10.750 --> 05:10:10.760 align:start position:0%
million at the same time time the bill
 
05:10:12.590 --> 05:10:12.600 align:start position:0%
adds IL defined language to the
 
05:10:15.750 --> 05:10:15.760 align:start position:0%
homestead statute by including several
 
05:10:17.750 --> 05:10:17.760 align:start position:0%
types of housing that would lead
 
05:10:22.510 --> 05:10:22.520 align:start position:0%
confusion dispute and inevitably legal
 
05:10:25.670 --> 05:10:25.680 align:start position:0%
challenges a homestead exemption is
 
05:10:28.470 --> 05:10:28.480 align:start position:0%
meant to keep families in their homes
 
05:10:31.110 --> 05:10:31.120 align:start position:0%
while they're navigating tough Financial
 
05:10:33.750 --> 05:10:33.760 align:start position:0%
Times it's a provision that helps
 
05:10:36.190 --> 05:10:36.200 align:start position:0%
prevent people from going from Bad
 
05:10:39.830 --> 05:10:39.840 align:start position:0%
economic circumstances to an unmitigated
 
05:10:43.030 --> 05:10:43.040 align:start position:0%
disaster and that's a good thing it
 
05:10:44.470 --> 05:10:44.480 align:start position:0%
would also be a good thing to
 
05:10:47.070 --> 05:10:47.080 align:start position:0%
re-evaluate the amount allowable under
 
05:10:50.350 --> 05:10:50.360 align:start position:0%
the exemption from time to time so that
 
05:10:53.150 --> 05:10:53.160 align:start position:0%
homeowners and creditors alike could be
 
05:10:55.430 --> 05:10:55.440 align:start position:0%
sure that those amounts reflect fair
 
05:10:59.350 --> 05:10:59.360 align:start position:0%
market values as economic conditions
 
05:11:03.030 --> 05:11:03.040 align:start position:0%
change but the current median price of a
 
05:11:05.948 --> 05:11:05.958 align:start position:0%
single family home in New Hampshire is
 
05:11:05.958 --> 05:11:08.030 align:start position:0%
single family home in New Hampshire is
around

05:11:08.030 --> 05:11:08.040 align:start position:0%
around
 
05:11:11.788 --> 05:11:11.798 align:start position:0%
$500,000 and The Proposal that HB 6177
 
05:11:14.910 --> 05:11:14.920 align:start position:0%
puts forward to increase the potential
 
05:11:18.628 --> 05:11:18.638 align:start position:0%
exemption to twice that amount and 10
 
05:11:22.510 --> 05:11:22.520 align:start position:0%
times what it is right now is just plain
 
05:11:25.590 --> 05:11:25.600 align:start position:0%
extravagant unjustified by the numbers
 
05:11:28.990 --> 05:11:29.000 align:start position:0%
and unworkable because of its confusing
 
05:11:32.310 --> 05:11:32.320 align:start position:0%
language I urge you to vote no on the
 
05:11:34.110 --> 05:11:34.120 align:start position:0%
committee recommendation of ought to
 
05:11:36.910 --> 05:11:36.920 align:start position:0%
pass as amended so that another motion
 
05:11:39.708 --> 05:11:39.718 align:start position:0%
can be made and another proposal
 
05:11:42.110 --> 05:11:42.120 align:start position:0%
more informed by the facts can be
 
05:11:44.830 --> 05:11:44.840 align:start position:0%
brought forward thank you Mr Speaker and
 
05:11:48.110 --> 05:11:48.120 align:start position:0%

Litchfield thank you Mr
 
05:12:03.868 --> 05:12:03.878 align:start position:0%
Speaker I I would like to begin by
 
05:12:05.708 --> 05:12:05.718 align:start position:0%
saying I would like to request a roll
 
05:12:09.948 --> 05:12:09.958 align:start position:0%
call vote on this bill if I could please
 
05:12:11.708 --> 05:12:11.718 align:start position:0%
is it okay to start with
 
05:12:16.510 --> 05:12:16.520 align:start position:0%
that do I have to wait okay
 
05:12:20.190 --> 05:12:20.200 align:start position:0%
stop so this bill is actually a
 
05:12:21.990 --> 05:12:22.000 align:start position:0%
bipartisan bill or I thought it was a
 
05:12:24.350 --> 05:12:24.360 align:start position:0%
bipartisan Bill uh it was brought to me
 
05:12:27.390 --> 05:12:27.400 align:start position:0%
by a constituent um that typically is
 
05:12:29.030 --> 05:12:29.040 align:start position:0%
conservative and then a second
 
05:12:31.230 --> 05:12:31.240 align:start position:0%
constituent brought it to me who is
 
05:12:35.070 --> 05:12:35.080 align:start position:0%
actually liberal this bill is already on
 
05:12:37.310 --> 05:12:37.320 align:start position:0%
the books this law is already on the B
 
05:12:39.628 --> 05:12:39.638 align:start position:0%
books as we've already heard
 
05:12:43.430 --> 05:12:43.440 align:start position:0%
it covers a home value of up to
 
05:12:46.070 --> 05:12:46.080 align:start position:0%
$120,000 the problem is that that does
 
05:12:48.590 --> 05:12:48.600 align:start position:0%
not is not up to date with the current
 
05:12:50.470 --> 05:12:50.480 align:start position:0%
market values of homes in the state of
 
05:12:52.910 --> 05:12:52.920 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and I do understand what
 
05:12:54.670 --> 05:12:54.680 align:start position:0%
what we're saying that the median value
 
05:12:56.230 --> 05:12:56.240 align:start position:0%
may be around
 
05:12:59.110 --> 05:12:59.120 align:start position:0%
500,000 but in doing my research there
 
05:13:00.708 --> 05:13:00.718 align:start position:0%
it's it's a vast State there are
 
05:13:02.708 --> 05:13:02.718 align:start position:0%
different Pockets with different home
 
05:13:04.708 --> 05:13:04.718 align:start position:0%
values so I just want to give you a
 
05:13:06.990 --> 05:13:07.000 align:start position:0%
couple of examples um my particular
 
05:13:11.070 --> 05:13:11.080 align:start position:0%
District uh the median sales price is
 
05:13:11.080 --> 05:13:13.310 align:start position:0%
District uh the median sales price is
$845,000

05:13:13.310 --> 05:13:13.320 align:start position:0%
$845,000
 
05:13:13.320 --> 05:13:15.350 align:start position:0%
$845,000

$785,000
 
05:13:26.948 --> 05:13:26.958 align:start position:0%
um and then let me see I'll just do at
 
05:13:26.958 --> 05:13:28.708 align:start position:0%
um and then let me see I'll just do at
ringe

05:13:28.708 --> 05:13:28.718 align:start position:0%
ringe
 
05:13:31.868 --> 05:13:31.878 align:start position:0%
$889,000 so the point of this law and it
 
05:13:33.708 --> 05:13:33.718 align:start position:0%
is out there I've researched all 50
 
05:13:36.270 --> 05:13:36.280 align:start position:0%
states many states have it many of them
 
05:13:38.390 --> 05:13:38.400 align:start position:0%
leave the value of the home unlimited it
 
05:13:41.350 --> 05:13:41.360 align:start position:0%
does not debt it does not cancel debt
 
05:13:43.310 --> 05:13:43.320 align:start position:0%
the problem is these days with the civil
 
05:13:45.948 --> 05:13:45.958 align:start position:0%
suits at one point in time they would go
 
05:13:47.590 --> 05:13:47.600 align:start position:0%
after your insurance if there was an
 
05:13:49.750 --> 05:13:49.760 align:start position:0%
incident nowadays they're going after
 
05:13:52.070 --> 05:13:52.080 align:start position:0%
your home so I had an attorney that came
 
05:13:55.510 --> 05:13:55.520 align:start position:0%
to me and he said to me look I have two
 
05:13:57.750 --> 05:13:57.760 align:start position:0%
cases one that happened a year ago and
 
05:13:59.788 --> 05:13:59.798 align:start position:0%
one that's currently pending one was a
 
05:14:02.830 --> 05:14:02.840 align:start position:0%
ski accident purely an accident he said
 
05:14:05.150 --> 05:14:05.160 align:start position:0%
from the outside looking in you can tell
 
05:14:06.830 --> 05:14:06.840 align:start position:0%
it it
 
05:14:09.510 --> 05:14:09.520 align:start position:0%
inadvertent someone was injured were
 
05:14:11.670 --> 05:14:11.680 align:start position:0%
hurt they did not feel that the
 
05:14:13.430 --> 05:14:13.440 align:start position:0%
insurance money was enough so they went
 
05:14:15.628 --> 05:14:15.638 align:start position:0%
after this person's home the person
 
05:14:18.230 --> 05:14:18.240 align:start position:0%
almost lost their home um they mentioned
 
05:14:19.830 --> 05:14:19.840 align:start position:0%
another person where it was the same
 
05:14:22.548 --> 05:14:22.558 align:start position:0%
idea it was a car accident and they
 
05:14:23.868 --> 05:14:23.878 align:start position:0%
didn't feel that the car insurance
 
05:14:25.830 --> 05:14:25.840 align:start position:0%
covered enough and they wanted to go
 
05:14:28.868 --> 05:14:28.878 align:start position:0%
after the person's home you still owe
 
05:14:31.708 --> 05:14:31.718 align:start position:0%
the debt I went through all 50 states
 
05:14:34.190 --> 05:14:34.200 align:start position:0%
and I put bumpers in I tried to cover
 
05:14:36.708 --> 05:14:36.718 align:start position:0%
and the reason why it's so detailed is I
 
05:14:39.230 --> 05:14:39.240 align:start position:0%
tried to be as comprehensive as I I
 
05:14:41.510 --> 05:14:41.520 align:start position:0%
could so you still have to pay your
 
05:14:43.990 --> 05:14:44.000 align:start position:0%
mortgage right um you could lose your
 
05:14:45.430 --> 05:14:45.440 align:start position:0%
house if you don't pay your mortgage you
 
05:14:47.030 --> 05:14:47.040 align:start position:0%
could lose your house if you don't pay
 
05:14:49.830 --> 05:14:49.840 align:start position:0%
your property taxes if you don't pay
 
05:14:52.070 --> 05:14:52.080 align:start position:0%
your bail bond you could still lose your
 
05:14:55.390 --> 05:14:55.400 align:start position:0%
house okay um this is again just to
 
05:14:59.470 --> 05:14:59.480 align:start position:0%
protect people from civil
 
05:15:01.788 --> 05:15:01.798 align:start position:0%
suits and I think that's about it I'm
 
05:15:03.430 --> 05:15:03.440 align:start position:0%
just simply saying that it's not staying
 
05:15:05.470 --> 05:15:05.480 align:start position:0%
up with the current law so what I would
 
05:15:07.430 --> 05:15:07.440 align:start position:0%
ask you to please pass this ought to
 
05:15:08.990 --> 05:15:09.000 align:start position:0%

05:29:15.670 --> 05:29:15.680 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker this bill is about
 
05:29:17.910 --> 05:29:17.920 align:start position:0%
something called the renewable energy
 
05:29:21.070 --> 05:29:21.080 align:start position:0%
fund what is that it is a dedicated
 
05:29:24.150 --> 05:29:24.160 align:start position:0%
non-aps fund it's funded by the
 
05:29:26.868 --> 05:29:26.878 align:start position:0%
utilities when they fall short of the
 
05:29:29.670 --> 05:29:29.680 align:start position:0%
goals of the renewable portfolio
 
05:29:33.430 --> 05:29:33.440 align:start position:0%
standard by Statute the renewable energy
 
05:29:36.948 --> 05:29:36.958 align:start position:0%
fund is intended to support guess what
 
05:29:39.070 --> 05:29:39.080 align:start position:0%
renewable energy
 
05:29:42.150 --> 05:29:42.160 align:start position:0%
initiatives this bill would reallocate
 
05:29:44.830 --> 05:29:44.840 align:start position:0%
the renewable energy fund including
 
05:29:47.030 --> 05:29:47.040 align:start position:0%
rebates to rate paays that sounds pretty
 
05:29:49.628 --> 05:29:49.638 align:start position:0%
good but I'm going to give you three
 
05:29:53.110 --> 05:29:53.120 align:start position:0%
good reasons to vote against this
 
05:29:55.430 --> 05:29:55.440 align:start position:0%
bill any one of these three should be
 
05:29:56.830 --> 05:29:56.840 align:start position:0%
enough to get you to press the red
 
05:29:59.070 --> 05:29:59.080 align:start position:0%
button but I'm going to give you all
 
05:30:02.470 --> 05:30:02.480 align:start position:0%
three number one because it's a
 
05:30:05.470 --> 05:30:05.480 align:start position:0%
dedicated non-aps fund that's not what's
 
05:30:06.830 --> 05:30:06.840 align:start position:0%
supposed to happen to it it's not
 
05:30:08.390 --> 05:30:08.400 align:start position:0%
supposed to be reallocated that it's
 
05:30:10.270 --> 05:30:10.280 align:start position:0%
supposed to be used for the purpose that
 
05:30:13.070 --> 05:30:13.080 align:start position:0%
it's intended for the current balance is
 
05:30:16.470 --> 05:30:16.480 align:start position:0%
$10 million and the bill would make 100%
 
05:30:19.270 --> 05:30:19.280 align:start position:0%
of these funds go to purposes that the
 
05:30:21.990 --> 05:30:22.000 align:start position:0%
fund was not intended for not only that
 
05:30:24.948 --> 05:30:24.958 align:start position:0%
this is a really good use of money every
 
05:30:26.670 --> 05:30:26.680 align:start position:0%
dollar that's invested from the
 
05:30:29.708 --> 05:30:29.718 align:start position:0%
renewable energy fund actually generates
 
05:30:32.868 --> 05:30:32.878 align:start position:0%
$8 of private investment that is a
 
05:30:35.548 --> 05:30:35.558 align:start position:0%
pretty darn good leverage I'd say we've
 
05:30:38.868 --> 05:30:38.878 align:start position:0%
seen $416 million
 
05:30:41.430 --> 05:30:41.440 align:start position:0%
in private investment from the renewable
 
05:30:45.390 --> 05:30:45.400 align:start position:0%
energy fund program to date moreover
 
05:30:47.350 --> 05:30:47.360 align:start position:0%
remember that renewable energy keeps
 
05:30:50.868 --> 05:30:50.878 align:start position:0%
money in the state on the other hand
 
05:30:53.310 --> 05:30:53.320 align:start position:0%
every dollar that we spend on fossil
 
05:30:56.150 --> 05:30:56.160 align:start position:0%
fuels is a dollar going to Texas
 
05:30:59.910 --> 05:30:59.920 align:start position:0%
Louisiana Oklahoma not staying in the
 
05:31:03.750 --> 05:31:03.760 align:start position:0%
state so that's number one number two if
 
05:31:06.750 --> 05:31:06.760 align:start position:0%
you look at the bill it's unclear how
 
05:31:09.150 --> 05:31:09.160 align:start position:0%
these funds would get red distributed
 
05:31:10.910 --> 05:31:10.920 align:start position:0%
the bill says that the funds go to
 
05:31:13.590 --> 05:31:13.600 align:start position:0%
administrative costs to the office of
 
05:31:16.830 --> 05:31:16.840 align:start position:0%
offshore wind and energy Innovation and
 
05:31:19.350 --> 05:31:19.360 align:start position:0%
incentive payments and whatever is left
 
05:31:21.990 --> 05:31:22.000 align:start position:0%
over that's what goes to the rate payer
 
05:31:25.110 --> 05:31:25.120 align:start position:0%
rebates the bill doesn't say how these
 
05:31:28.190 --> 05:31:28.200 align:start position:0%
things get distributed and I have no
 
05:31:30.390 --> 05:31:30.400 align:start position:0%
idea what incentive payments are that is
 
05:31:30.400 --> 05:31:31.430 align:start position:0%
idea what incentive payments are that is
just

05:31:31.430 --> 05:31:31.440 align:start position:0%
just
 
05:31:34.628 --> 05:31:34.638 align:start position:0%
undefined so what does this work out to
 
05:31:37.350 --> 05:31:37.360 align:start position:0%
well I looked at my December 2024 bill
 
05:31:40.868 --> 05:31:40.878 align:start position:0%
from Liber utilities which by a bill
 
05:31:43.230 --> 05:31:43.240 align:start position:0%
that we passed a couple of years ago
 
05:31:46.310 --> 05:31:46.320 align:start position:0%
tells us how much we paid into the
 
05:31:48.948 --> 05:31:48.958 align:start position:0%
renewable uh energy fund or actually the
 
05:31:51.270 --> 05:31:51.280 align:start position:0%
cost of RPS compliance renewable
 
05:31:53.990 --> 05:31:54.000 align:start position:0%
portfolio standard compliance in
 
05:31:58.510 --> 05:31:58.520 align:start position:0%
20123 the average rate payer spent
 
05:32:01.548 --> 05:32:01.558 align:start position:0%
$24.75 for the year on compliance with
 
05:32:04.510 --> 05:32:04.520 align:start position:0%
the renewable portfolio standard only
 
05:32:06.150 --> 05:32:06.160 align:start position:0%
some of that went into the renewable
 
05:32:09.030 --> 05:32:09.040 align:start position:0%
energy fund so when you take out the
 
05:32:11.750 --> 05:32:11.760 align:start position:0%
administrative costs funding the office
 
05:32:15.270 --> 05:32:15.280 align:start position:0%
of offshore wind and energy Innovation
 
05:32:17.270 --> 05:32:17.280 align:start position:0%
and whatever incentive payments are I
 
05:32:18.390 --> 05:32:18.400 align:start position:0%
have no
 
05:32:21.590 --> 05:32:21.600 align:start position:0%
idea what's left over as a rebate for
 
05:32:24.548 --> 05:32:24.558 align:start position:0%
the average customer would end up buying
 
05:32:29.670 --> 05:32:29.680 align:start position:0%
about one latte from Starbucks per year
 
05:32:32.590 --> 05:32:32.600 align:start position:0%
so if you think it's a really good idea
 
05:32:35.990 --> 05:32:36.000 align:start position:0%
to tell your constituents yeah I decided
 
05:32:39.030 --> 05:32:39.040 align:start position:0%
to keep money uh flowing to Texas and
 
05:32:41.708 --> 05:32:41.718 align:start position:0%
Oklahoma for fossil fuels so you could
 
05:32:44.430 --> 05:32:44.440 align:start position:0%
have one latte from Starbucks this year
 
05:32:46.270 --> 05:32:46.280 align:start position:0%
go for
 
05:32:49.030 --> 05:32:49.040 align:start position:0%
it final thing number three and this is
 
05:32:52.510 --> 05:32:52.520 align:start position:0%
the best one if you look at the trailer
 
05:32:52.520 --> 05:32:53.510 align:start position:0%
the best one if you look at the trailer
bill

05:32:53.510 --> 05:32:53.520 align:start position:0%
bill
 
05:32:58.270 --> 05:32:58.280 align:start position:0%
hb2 and I refer you to page 73 section
 
05:33:01.310 --> 05:33:01.320 align:start position:0%
188 of the bill it says that it's going
 
05:33:03.948 --> 05:33:03.958 align:start position:0%
to sweep the $10 million that are in the
 
05:33:06.548 --> 05:33:06.558 align:start position:0%
renewable energy fund into the general
 
05:33:06.558 --> 05:33:08.190 align:start position:0%
renewable energy fund into the general
fund

05:33:08.190 --> 05:33:08.200 align:start position:0%
fund
 
05:33:12.590 --> 05:33:12.600 align:start position:0%
so which is it are we going to use the
 
05:33:15.150 --> 05:33:15.160 align:start position:0%
renewable energy fund to sweep into the
 
05:33:18.110 --> 05:33:18.120 align:start position:0%
general fund are we going to have it go
 
05:33:20.390 --> 05:33:20.400 align:start position:0%
to the rate payers and these other
 
05:33:24.310 --> 05:33:24.320 align:start position:0%
purposes it can't be both it seems that
 
05:33:26.030 --> 05:33:26.040 align:start position:0%
someone's left hand doesn't know what
 
05:33:29.590 --> 05:33:29.600 align:start position:0%
someone's right hand is doing so this is
 
05:33:32.868 --> 05:33:32.878 align:start position:0%
just a plain bad Bill I've given you
 
05:33:34.990 --> 05:33:35.000 align:start position:0%
three good reasons to vote against it so
 
05:33:38.230 --> 05:33:38.240 align:start position:0%
I ask you to press the red button on the
 
05:33:42.510 --> 05:33:42.520 align:start position:0%
motion three times and Mr Speaker I
 
05:33:44.270 --> 05:33:44.280 align:start position:0%
request a roll call
 
05:33:50.750 --> 05:33:50.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:54.070 --> 05:33:54.080 align:start position:0%
n thank you Mr Speaker I rise in support
 
05:33:56.390 --> 05:33:56.400 align:start position:0%
of the ought toach Mo motion on House
 
05:33:56.400 --> 05:33:57.548 align:start position:0%
of the ought toach Mo motion on House
Bill

05:33:57.548 --> 05:33:57.558 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
05:34:00.310 --> 05:34:00.320 align:start position:0%
224 I sponsored this bill to help lower
 
05:34:02.990 --> 05:34:03.000 align:start position:0%
energy costs we can do that by rebating
 
05:34:04.910 --> 05:34:04.920 align:start position:0%
most of the renewable energy fund back
 
05:34:08.310 --> 05:34:08.320 align:start position:0%
to rate payers saving between 2. 5 and
 
05:34:12.230 --> 05:34:12.240 align:start position:0%
$7.3 million a year we have some of the
 
05:34:15.150 --> 05:34:15.160 align:start position:0%
highest energy costs in the country we
 
05:34:17.190 --> 05:34:17.200 align:start position:0%
saw an example of the impact of these
 
05:34:19.990 --> 05:34:20.000 align:start position:0%
high electricity prices just last week
 
05:34:22.150 --> 05:34:22.160 align:start position:0%
where on Friday the New Hampshire
 
05:34:24.470 --> 05:34:24.480 align:start position:0%
Electric Co-op announced another rate
 
05:34:26.830 --> 05:34:26.840 align:start position:0%
hike meaning they have increased their
 
05:34:29.590 --> 05:34:29.600 align:start position:0%
rates by more than 6% since
 
05:34:32.270 --> 05:34:32.280 align:start position:0%
December Granite Staters need relief
 
05:34:34.830 --> 05:34:34.840 align:start position:0%
from higher energy costs now and this
 
05:34:37.708 --> 05:34:37.718 align:start position:0%
bill offers them that rebating fund
 
05:34:39.990 --> 05:34:40.000 align:start position:0%
funds back to rate payers Is Not A New
 
05:34:42.910 --> 05:34:42.920 align:start position:0%
Concept we have been rebating funds from
 
05:34:45.190 --> 05:34:45.200 align:start position:0%
the regional greenhouse gas initiative
 
05:34:48.030 --> 05:34:48.040 align:start position:0%
Reggie for 13 years and that has saved
 
05:34:49.830 --> 05:34:49.840 align:start position:0%
rate payers hundreds of millions of
 
05:34:52.868 --> 05:34:52.878 align:start position:0%
dollars over that time frame if that
 
05:34:55.030 --> 05:34:55.040 align:start position:0%
legislation didn't go through we would
 
05:34:57.190 --> 05:34:57.200 align:start position:0%
be paying even higher costs now than we
 
05:34:59.868 --> 05:34:59.878 align:start position:0%
already are those opposed to the bill
 
05:35:02.868 --> 05:35:02.878 align:start position:0%
want the subsidies to continue subsidy
 
05:35:05.310 --> 05:35:05.320 align:start position:0%
programs help some but it's at the
 
05:35:08.670 --> 05:35:08.680 align:start position:0%
expense of others which is unfortunate
 
05:35:13.030 --> 05:35:13.040 align:start position:0%
as amended HP 224 will exempt administra
 
05:35:16.110 --> 05:35:16.120 align:start position:0%
administrative costs and funding for the
 
05:35:19.510 --> 05:35:19.520 align:start position:0%
office of energy Innovation rebate ourf
 
05:35:21.788 --> 05:35:21.798 align:start position:0%
money to rate payers and lower energy
 
05:35:24.350 --> 05:35:24.360 align:start position:0%
costs I ask the body to support the op
 
05:35:27.190 --> 05:35:27.200 align:start position:0%
to pass motion on House Bill 224 by
 
05:35:29.708 --> 05:35:29.718 align:start position:0%

05:36:42.150 --> 05:36:42.160 align:start position:0%
committee report of aut passes amended
 
05:36:44.510 --> 05:36:44.520 align:start position:0%

05:37:04.030 --> 05:37:04.040 align:start position:0%
Speaker if I knew the renewable energy
 
05:37:07.110 --> 05:37:07.120 align:start position:0%
fund incentivizes critical renewable
 
05:37:10.150 --> 05:37:10.160 align:start position:0%
energy projects in New Hampshire with
 
05:37:12.110 --> 05:37:12.120 align:start position:0%
nearly eight times the amount spent from
 
05:37:15.830 --> 05:37:15.840 align:start position:0%
the fund Amplified by private
 
05:37:19.548 --> 05:37:19.558 align:start position:0%
funding and if I knew that Granite
 
05:37:22.788 --> 05:37:22.798 align:start position:0%
Staters were their primary beneficiaries
 
05:37:25.190 --> 05:37:25.200 align:start position:0%
of the renewable energy and economic
 
05:37:27.070 --> 05:37:27.080 align:start position:0%
Investments this
 
05:37:30.150 --> 05:37:30.160 align:start position:0%
creates and if I knew that this bill
 
05:37:32.470 --> 05:37:32.480 align:start position:0%
would undermine the integrity and
 
05:37:35.110 --> 05:37:35.120 align:start position:0%
availability of those fund reserves by
 
05:37:37.990 --> 05:37:38.000 align:start position:0%
shifting them to purposes that may have
 
05:37:40.548 --> 05:37:40.558 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with renewable
 
05:37:44.070 --> 05:37:44.080 align:start position:0%
energy then would I press the red button
 
05:37:47.110 --> 05:37:47.120 align:start position:0%
to defeat this bill so another motion
 
05:37:48.070 --> 05:37:48.080 align:start position:0%
can be
 
05:37:50.590 --> 05:37:50.600 align:start position:0%
made chair recognize representative n
 
05:37:52.590 --> 05:37:52.600 align:start position:0%
for parliamentary
 
05:37:55.868 --> 05:37:55.878 align:start position:0%
inquiry thank you Mr Speaker if I know
 
05:37:58.070 --> 05:37:58.080 align:start position:0%
that the granite state suffers from
 
05:38:00.390 --> 05:38:00.400 align:start position:0%
extremely high energy costs and if I
 
05:38:02.030 --> 05:38:02.040 align:start position:0%
know that this bill will help alleviate
 
05:38:03.990 --> 05:38:04.000 align:start position:0%
some of the suffering by rebating funds
 
05:38:05.830 --> 05:38:05.840 align:start position:0%
back to the rate payers would I then
 
05:38:07.670 --> 05:38:07.680 align:start position:0%
press the green button to pass house
 
05:38:10.788 --> 05:38:10.798 align:start position:0%

05:42:39.830 --> 05:42:39.840 align:start position:0%
for my fellow members of the emerging
 
05:42:43.468 --> 05:42:43.478 align:start position:0%
Technologies caucus making energy data
 
05:42:46.510 --> 05:42:46.520 align:start position:0%
accessible is very popular right now
 
05:42:48.468 --> 05:42:48.478 align:start position:0%
it's a big thing in the United States
 
05:42:51.110 --> 05:42:51.120 align:start position:0%
and around the world because of the
 
05:42:53.468 --> 05:42:53.478 align:start position:0%
money saving abilities you have when you
 
05:42:55.548 --> 05:42:55.558 align:start position:0%
unlock that
 
05:43:00.590 --> 05:43:00.600 align:start position:0%
data Governor sununu signed SB 284 into
 
05:43:02.430 --> 05:43:02.440 align:start position:0%
law in
 
05:43:05.590 --> 05:43:05.600 align:start position:0%
2019 it compelled the state's Electric
 
05:43:08.830 --> 05:43:08.840 align:start position:0%
and Gas Utilities to to work together
 
05:43:10.910 --> 05:43:10.920 align:start position:0%
along with the New Hampshire energy
 
05:43:13.070 --> 05:43:13.080 align:start position:0%
stakeholders and even experts from
 
05:43:14.510 --> 05:43:14.520 align:start position:0%
around the country who were very
 
05:43:16.708 --> 05:43:16.718 align:start position:0%
interested in this Innovative
 
05:43:20.430 --> 05:43:20.440 align:start position:0%
project um and they set up a docket uh
 
05:43:23.230 --> 05:43:23.240 align:start position:0%
at the Public Utilities Commission or
 
05:43:27.948 --> 05:43:27.958 align:start position:0%
pu their task was to create secure
 
05:43:30.590 --> 05:43:30.600 align:start position:0%
automated access to New Hampshire's
 
05:43:33.548 --> 05:43:33.558 align:start position:0%
electric and gas data so that we can
 
05:43:36.510 --> 05:43:36.520 align:start position:0%
plan for and create cost savings on
 
05:43:38.350 --> 05:43:38.360 align:start position:0%
energy throughout the
 
05:43:41.070 --> 05:43:41.080 align:start position:0%
state we were not the first state to try
 
05:43:43.708 --> 05:43:43.718 align:start position:0%
this we had examples from states that
 
05:43:45.990 --> 05:43:46.000 align:start position:0%
were early adopters like Texas and
 
05:43:50.030 --> 05:43:50.040 align:start position:0%
Illinois and New York before us all who
 
05:43:51.708 --> 05:43:51.718 align:start position:0%
got a handle on their energy data in
 
05:43:54.190 --> 05:43:54.200 align:start position:0%
order to find savings and create
 
05:43:56.030 --> 05:43:56.040 align:start position:0%
Innovations in the free
 
05:43:58.910 --> 05:43:58.920 align:start position:0%
market many other states are in various
 
05:44:01.590 --> 05:44:01.600 align:start position:0%
stages of doing the same thing and
 
05:44:03.510 --> 05:44:03.520 align:start position:0%
harnessing energy data is not that
 
05:44:05.948 --> 05:44:05.958 align:start position:0%
unusual around the world but many
 
05:44:08.948 --> 05:44:08.958 align:start position:0%
Outsiders looking into our pu docket
 
05:44:11.190 --> 05:44:11.200 align:start position:0%
were intrigued by the New Hampshire
 
05:44:14.468 --> 05:44:14.478 align:start position:0%
collaboration it was fruitful we learned
 
05:44:16.510 --> 05:44:16.520 align:start position:0%
from other states we applied what we
 
05:44:20.110 --> 05:44:20.120 align:start position:0%
learned and we designed uh a tool that
 
05:44:22.110 --> 05:44:22.120 align:start position:0%
would benefit from that
 
05:44:24.750 --> 05:44:24.760 align:start position:0%
knowledge we talked a lot about
 
05:44:28.030 --> 05:44:28.040 align:start position:0%
Innovation and free markets on our
 
05:44:31.110 --> 05:44:31.120 align:start position:0%
committee we talk about saving people
 
05:44:34.150 --> 05:44:34.160 align:start position:0%
money a lot in the house and we have
 
05:44:36.150 --> 05:44:36.160 align:start position:0%
certainly spent time telling people we
 
05:44:37.788 --> 05:44:37.798 align:start position:0%
are going to save them money on their
 
05:44:37.798 --> 05:44:39.150 align:start position:0%
are going to save them money on their
energy

05:44:39.150 --> 05:44:39.160 align:start position:0%
energy
 
05:44:41.430 --> 05:44:41.440 align:start position:0%
bills well here's our
 
05:44:45.230 --> 05:44:45.240 align:start position:0%
chance the bill required the utilities
 
05:44:47.948 --> 05:44:47.958 align:start position:0%
to run a project uh by forming a
 
05:44:50.468 --> 05:44:50.478 align:start position:0%
governance Council of stakeholders
 
05:44:52.990 --> 05:44:53.000 align:start position:0%
including the department of energy uh
 
05:44:54.910 --> 05:44:54.920 align:start position:0%
this group includes it professionals
 
05:44:58.628 --> 05:44:58.638 align:start position:0%
from the utilities who have spent years
 
05:45:01.270 --> 05:45:01.280 align:start position:0%
pursuing something they never would have
 
05:45:03.628 --> 05:45:03.638 align:start position:0%
without the state's
 
05:45:06.510 --> 05:45:06.520 align:start position:0%
prompting they gave up control of their
 
05:45:09.750 --> 05:45:09.760 align:start position:0%
individual ual data in order to support
 
05:45:09.760 --> 05:45:10.868 align:start position:0%
individual ual data in order to support
this

05:45:10.868 --> 05:45:10.878 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:45:13.510 --> 05:45:13.520 align:start position:0%
project and you know what since the
 
05:45:15.910 --> 05:45:15.920 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor of the bill had absolutely
 
05:45:17.628 --> 05:45:17.638 align:start position:0%
no knowledge of this project before he
 
05:45:19.708 --> 05:45:19.718 align:start position:0%
filed the bill I'm thinking maybe some
 
05:45:21.150 --> 05:45:21.160 align:start position:0%
of them still don't want to give up
 
05:45:21.160 --> 05:45:22.270 align:start position:0%
of them still don't want to give up
their

05:45:22.270 --> 05:45:22.280 align:start position:0%
their
 
05:45:26.868 --> 05:45:26.878 align:start position:0%
data but data access is a gateway uh to
 
05:45:29.310 --> 05:45:29.320 align:start position:0%
information and that information unlocks
 
05:45:31.670 --> 05:45:31.680 align:start position:0%
all kinds of innovation in the free
 
05:45:35.110 --> 05:45:35.120 align:start position:0%
market and you can't manage what you
 
05:45:37.430 --> 05:45:37.440 align:start position:0%
can't measure
 
05:45:39.670 --> 05:45:39.680 align:start position:0%
so what does the New Hampshire data Hub
 
05:45:42.788 --> 05:45:42.798 align:start position:0%
do automating all our energy data in one
 
05:45:45.190 --> 05:45:45.200 align:start position:0%
place can give individuals a way to
 
05:45:46.948 --> 05:45:46.958 align:start position:0%
figure out the cheapest way to lower
 
05:45:48.190 --> 05:45:48.200 align:start position:0%
their energy
 
05:45:51.150 --> 05:45:51.160 align:start position:0%
bills it can help energy competitors
 
05:45:54.110 --> 05:45:54.120 align:start position:0%
bring greater efficiencies to businesses
 
05:45:56.868 --> 05:45:56.878 align:start position:0%
or facilities managers uh can get
 
05:45:58.990 --> 05:45:59.000 align:start position:0%
accurate pictures of the energy use of
 
05:46:01.150 --> 05:46:01.160 align:start position:0%
their entire building complex they can't
 
05:46:03.628 --> 05:46:03.638 align:start position:0%
do that today uh or how about
 
05:46:06.230 --> 05:46:06.240 align:start position:0%
municipalities who want an analysis of
 
05:46:08.430 --> 05:46:08.440 align:start position:0%
their gas and electric use so that they
 
05:46:10.468 --> 05:46:10.478 align:start position:0%
can cut energy costs and pass those
 
05:46:12.030 --> 05:46:12.040 align:start position:0%
savings on to
 
05:46:14.750 --> 05:46:14.760 align:start position:0%
taxpayers the New Hampshire data data
 
05:46:16.430 --> 05:46:16.440 align:start position:0%
Hub is a game
 
05:46:19.190 --> 05:46:19.200 align:start position:0%
Cher but only if we defeat this effort
 
05:46:21.750 --> 05:46:21.760 align:start position:0%
to kill it before the cost benefit
 
05:46:25.190 --> 05:46:25.200 align:start position:0%
analysis is completed this
 
05:46:27.868 --> 05:46:27.878 align:start position:0%
fall and if the conclusion of the cost
 
05:46:31.030 --> 05:46:31.040 align:start position:0%
benefit analysis isn't significant cost
 
05:46:32.948 --> 05:46:32.958 align:start position:0%
savings for granite Staters then the
 
05:46:35.868 --> 05:46:35.878 align:start position:0%
project will be rejected based upon its
 
05:46:38.270 --> 05:46:38.280 align:start position:0%
merits over at the Public Utilities
 
05:46:40.390 --> 05:46:40.400 align:start position:0%
Commission so there is already a process
 
05:46:42.628 --> 05:46:42.638 align:start position:0%
to kill this project if in any way it
 
05:46:45.030 --> 05:46:45.040 align:start position:0%
comes back not being a cost savings to
 
05:46:48.670 --> 05:46:48.680 align:start position:0%
the rate payers able to unlock a lot of
 
05:46:51.190 --> 05:46:51.200 align:start position:0%
savings so if that cost benefit analysis
 
05:46:53.270 --> 05:46:53.280 align:start position:0%
doesn't pencil out then the project will
 
05:46:54.628 --> 05:46:54.638 align:start position:0%
be canceled with the knowledge that we
 
05:46:57.190 --> 05:46:57.200 align:start position:0%
were wrong about the savings that we
 
05:46:59.628 --> 05:46:59.638 align:start position:0%
could bring to rate payers but today we
 
05:47:02.150 --> 05:47:02.160 align:start position:0%
have no proof we have no proof of the
 
05:47:04.190 --> 05:47:04.200 align:start position:0%
cost and we have no proof of the
 
05:47:06.350 --> 05:47:06.360 align:start position:0%
benefits and the guesstimate that makes
 
05:47:09.310 --> 05:47:09.320 align:start position:0%
up the fiscal note admits that the
 
05:47:12.830 --> 05:47:12.840 align:start position:0%
actual costs are unknown and there is no
 
05:47:14.548 --> 05:47:14.558 align:start position:0%
offer of an assessment of any of the
 
05:47:17.190 --> 05:47:17.200 align:start position:0%
benefits of which there are many um
 
05:47:19.030 --> 05:47:19.040 align:start position:0%
according to a national energy
 
05:47:21.510 --> 05:47:21.520 align:start position:0%
consulting firm called dunsky who did a
 
05:47:23.910 --> 05:47:23.920 align:start position:0%
preliminary New Hampshire based analysis
 
05:47:25.590 --> 05:47:25.600 align:start position:0%
they concluded that residential rate
 
05:47:28.390 --> 05:47:28.400 align:start position:0%
payers will realize most of the savings
 
05:47:31.150 --> 05:47:31.160 align:start position:0%
from the New Hampshire data Hub um and
 
05:47:32.548 --> 05:47:32.558 align:start position:0%
those savings are in the tens of
 
05:47:34.430 --> 05:47:34.440 align:start position:0%
millions but they can't give us an
 
05:47:37.868 --> 05:47:37.878 align:start position:0%
actual cost benefit until till the price
 
05:47:40.230 --> 05:47:40.240 align:start position:0%
is in on what it'll cost us to build it
 
05:47:43.590 --> 05:47:43.600 align:start position:0%
and then what those benefits will be I
 
05:47:45.628 --> 05:47:45.638 align:start position:0%
ask that you push the red button to stop
 
05:47:47.990 --> 05:47:48.000 align:start position:0%
the sabotage of a project that we the
 
05:47:51.150 --> 05:47:51.160 align:start position:0%
state pursued in order to save people
 
05:47:53.788 --> 05:47:53.798 align:start position:0%
money on their energy bills something we
 
05:47:56.430 --> 05:47:56.440 align:start position:0%
keep saying we're doing and now you can
 
05:47:58.390 --> 05:47:58.400 align:start position:0%
point to something and say we are doing
 
05:48:01.270 --> 05:48:01.280 align:start position:0%
that uh nothing is gained by killing
 
05:48:04.150 --> 05:48:04.160 align:start position:0%
this project here today before we know
 
05:48:07.310 --> 05:48:07.320 align:start position:0%
what we are about to lose um please vote
 
05:48:09.868 --> 05:48:09.878 align:start position:0%
red for your constituents and Mr Speaker
 
05:48:13.270 --> 05:48:13.280 align:start position:0%
I ask that we um I request a roll call
 
05:48:13.280 --> 05:48:15.670 align:start position:0%
I ask that we um I request a roll call
vote

05:48:15.670 --> 05:48:15.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:23.230 --> 05:48:23.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:27.310 --> 05:48:27.320 align:start position:0%
Bry thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker one
 
05:48:29.030 --> 05:48:29.040 align:start position:0%
of the core functions of the New
 
05:48:30.948 --> 05:48:30.958 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Public Utilities Commission
 
05:48:33.750 --> 05:48:33.760 align:start position:0%
the Pu is to evaluate and then approve
 
05:48:36.510 --> 05:48:36.520 align:start position:0%
or deny proposals by regulated utilities
 
05:48:39.230 --> 05:48:39.240 align:start position:0%
for for Capital Improvements when a u
 
05:48:41.628 --> 05:48:41.638 align:start position:0%
utility wants to upgrade equipment or
 
05:48:44.070 --> 05:48:44.080 align:start position:0%
software they must justify the associate
 
05:48:47.190 --> 05:48:47.200 align:start position:0%
expenses to the PVC an integral part of
 
05:48:49.150 --> 05:48:49.160 align:start position:0%
this justification is to show that the
 
05:48:51.430 --> 05:48:51.440 align:start position:0%
improvements will be coste effective and
 
05:48:53.270 --> 05:48:53.280 align:start position:0%
provide benefits to their
 
05:48:56.548 --> 05:48:56.558 align:start position:0%
customers for example Unitil
 
05:48:58.230 --> 05:48:58.240 align:start position:0%
successfully went through this process
 
05:49:00.070 --> 05:49:00.080 align:start position:0%
some years ago to upgrade all of their
 
05:49:02.548 --> 05:49:02.558 align:start position:0%
customers electric meters and to build a
 
05:49:04.910 --> 05:49:04.920 align:start position:0%
data platform and an app where customers
 
05:49:07.868 --> 05:49:07.878 align:start position:0%
can monitor their own electric use usage
 
05:49:09.788 --> 05:49:09.798 align:start position:0%
the current process is well established
 
05:49:09.798 --> 05:49:10.830 align:start position:0%
the current process is well established
and

05:49:10.830 --> 05:49:10.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:49:13.510 --> 05:49:13.520 align:start position:0%
effective the subject of this bill the
 
05:49:16.430 --> 05:49:16.440 align:start position:0%
Statewide multi-use energy data platform
 
05:49:19.708 --> 05:49:19.718 align:start position:0%
law flips that process on its head it
 
05:49:21.788 --> 05:49:21.798 align:start position:0%
mandates that the department of energy
 
05:49:23.750 --> 05:49:23.760 align:start position:0%
and the utilities build a centralized
 
05:49:26.628 --> 05:49:26.638 align:start position:0%
Statewide data platform and at the same
 
05:49:28.788 --> 05:49:28.798 align:start position:0%
time also mandates that the project
 
05:49:31.270 --> 05:49:31.280 align:start position:0%
should be deferred if the cost is
 
05:49:33.430 --> 05:49:33.440 align:start position:0%
unreasonable or not in the public
 
05:49:35.910 --> 05:49:35.920 align:start position:0%
interest it is a bit like a Perpetual
 
05:49:38.110 --> 05:49:38.120 align:start position:0%
contradiction machine the project is
 
05:49:40.230 --> 05:49:40.240 align:start position:0%
bylaw mandated to go forward but also
 
05:49:42.270 --> 05:49:42.280 align:start position:0%
bylaw mandated to be deferred if not in
 
05:49:45.270 --> 05:49:45.280 align:start position:0%
the public interest as you might imagine
 
05:49:46.948 --> 05:49:46.958 align:start position:0%
this has led to a situation where
 
05:49:48.948 --> 05:49:48.958 align:start position:0%
resources are continuously spent by the
 
05:49:51.310 --> 05:49:51.320 align:start position:0%
department of energy the utilities and
 
05:49:53.830 --> 05:49:53.840 align:start position:0%
other Brokers to move this
 
05:49:56.670 --> 05:49:56.680 align:start position:0%
along but in the six years since this
 
05:49:58.510 --> 05:49:58.520 align:start position:0%
mandate was passed no code has been
 
05:50:00.868 --> 05:50:00.878 align:start position:0%
written and no software
 
05:50:03.510 --> 05:50:03.520 align:start position:0%
procured over the years two federal
 
05:50:05.788 --> 05:50:05.798 align:start position:0%
grants were sought and all were rejected
 
05:50:07.670 --> 05:50:07.680 align:start position:0%
by the Biden administ ministration which
 
05:50:10.310 --> 05:50:10.320 align:start position:0%
I'd argue was generally supportive of
 
05:50:13.310 --> 05:50:13.320 align:start position:0%
such infrastructure projects some of the
 
05:50:15.830 --> 05:50:15.840 align:start position:0%
reasons for rejection included quote
 
05:50:17.990 --> 05:50:18.000 align:start position:0%
does not adequately build a case that
 
05:50:19.590 --> 05:50:19.600 align:start position:0%
the proposed project will lead to
 
05:50:23.110 --> 05:50:23.120 align:start position:0%
proposed benefits and quote the project
 
05:50:24.788 --> 05:50:24.798 align:start position:0%
impact may be
 
05:50:27.628 --> 05:50:27.638 align:start position:0%
unrealistic and quote does not justify
 
05:50:30.270 --> 05:50:30.280 align:start position:0%
the Project's economic
 
05:50:32.990 --> 05:50:33.000 align:start position:0%
viability so to reiterate the previous
 
05:50:34.830 --> 05:50:34.840 align:start position:0%
green energy Administration which was
 
05:50:36.788 --> 05:50:36.798 align:start position:0%
not shy in spending on these kinds of
 
05:50:39.670 --> 05:50:39.680 align:start position:0%
projects deemed this project is not does
 
05:50:42.628 --> 05:50:42.638 align:start position:0%
not have economic
 
05:50:44.990 --> 05:50:45.000 align:start position:0%
viability proponents will argue that the
 
05:50:47.270 --> 05:50:47.280 align:start position:0%
benefits are clear and that after 6
 
05:50:49.990 --> 05:50:50.000 align:start position:0%
years only the cost is still unknown
 
05:50:52.350 --> 05:50:52.360 align:start position:0%
let's validate some of that argument on
 
05:50:55.788 --> 05:50:55.798 align:start position:0%
cost we have some hints utilities have
 
05:51:00.310 --> 05:51:00.320 align:start position:0%
estimated $4.5 to7 million just in their
 
05:51:02.788 --> 05:51:02.798 align:start position:0%
own cost to Simply connect to this data
 
05:51:05.390 --> 05:51:05.400 align:start position:0%
platform you can reasonably extrapolate
 
05:51:07.110 --> 05:51:07.120 align:start position:0%
from this that the platform itself will
 
05:51:08.430 --> 05:51:08.440 align:start position:0%
be significantly more than the
 
05:51:10.670 --> 05:51:10.680 align:start position:0%
connection cost probably in the tens of
 
05:51:13.468 --> 05:51:13.478 align:start position:0%
millions of dollars the benefits
 
05:51:15.510 --> 05:51:15.520 align:start position:0%
argument comes from a report by the
 
05:51:18.628 --> 05:51:18.638 align:start position:0%
dunsky corporation and it only covers
 
05:51:21.310 --> 05:51:21.320 align:start position:0%
customers accessing their own usage data
 
05:51:24.430 --> 05:51:24.440 align:start position:0%
like the Unitil example I gave earlier
 
05:51:26.590 --> 05:51:26.600 align:start position:0%
but the Unitil solution was built and
 
05:51:28.628 --> 05:51:28.638 align:start position:0%
operates today without the Statewide
 
05:51:31.590 --> 05:51:31.600 align:start position:0%
data platform therefore the argued
 
05:51:33.750 --> 05:51:33.760 align:start position:0%
benefits can already be achieved and are
 
05:51:36.868 --> 05:51:36.878 align:start position:0%
being achieved without this platform
 
05:51:38.548 --> 05:51:38.558 align:start position:0%
but maybe there are other benefits we
 
05:51:41.230 --> 05:51:41.240 align:start position:0%
just haven't discovered yet a colleague
 
05:51:43.150 --> 05:51:43.160 align:start position:0%
in committee suggested quote why not
 
05:51:44.670 --> 05:51:44.680 align:start position:0%
just build it and then see if there are
 
05:51:44.680 --> 05:51:45.510 align:start position:0%
just build it and then see if there are
any

05:51:45.510 --> 05:51:45.520 align:start position:0%
any
 
05:51:47.590 --> 05:51:47.600 align:start position:0%
benefits I actually agree with that
 
05:51:49.590 --> 05:51:49.600 align:start position:0%
sentiment this is what software startups
 
05:51:51.350 --> 05:51:51.360 align:start position:0%
do all the time sometimes they build
 
05:51:53.510 --> 05:51:53.520 align:start position:0%
valuable and beneficial products but
 
05:51:56.150 --> 05:51:56.160 align:start position:0%
most of the time they end up failing
 
05:51:57.868 --> 05:51:57.878 align:start position:0%
Tech Innovation is not easy or
 
05:51:59.468 --> 05:51:59.478 align:start position:0%
straightforward it's best left to
 
05:52:01.270 --> 05:52:01.280 align:start position:0%
entrepreneurs to Risk Takers and the
 
05:52:04.030 --> 05:52:04.040 align:start position:0%
free market not to estate government
 
05:52:06.150 --> 05:52:06.160 align:start position:0%
bureaucracy the role of government is to
 
05:52:08.390 --> 05:52:08.400 align:start position:0%
Res is to be responsible stewards of
 
05:52:10.190 --> 05:52:10.200 align:start position:0%
public resources the government should
 
05:52:11.868 --> 05:52:11.878 align:start position:0%
stick to buying reliable and proven
 
05:52:14.310 --> 05:52:14.320 align:start position:0%
software with clear benefits especially
 
05:52:16.910 --> 05:52:16.920 align:start position:0%
when it comes to our energy
 
05:52:20.070 --> 05:52:20.080 align:start position:0%
grid so is the Statewide data platform
 
05:52:22.948 --> 05:52:22.958 align:start position:0%
beneficial maybe maybe not but after six
 
05:52:24.590 --> 05:52:24.600 align:start position:0%
years of trying to get this project off
 
05:52:26.830 --> 05:52:26.840 align:start position:0%
the ground perhaps it's time to cut our
 
05:52:29.390 --> 05:52:29.400 align:start position:0%
losses the department of energy would be
 
05:52:31.230 --> 05:52:31.240 align:start position:0%
the biggest benefactor of this project
 
05:52:32.830 --> 05:52:32.840 align:start position:0%
because it would give them a view of the
 
05:52:35.430 --> 05:52:35.440 align:start position:0%
Statewide energy usage and yet they
 
05:52:37.350 --> 05:52:37.360 align:start position:0%
testify that they are neutral on this
 
05:52:40.030 --> 05:52:40.040 align:start position:0%
bill if they don't need this platform
 
05:52:42.070 --> 05:52:42.080 align:start position:0%
and utilities can already meet their
 
05:52:43.670 --> 05:52:43.680 align:start position:0%
customer needs with their own data
 
05:52:46.110 --> 05:52:46.120 align:start position:0%
platforms then let's repeal this mandate
 
05:52:48.468 --> 05:52:48.478 align:start position:0%
and save some money vote green thank you
 
05:52:48.478 --> 05:52:50.708 align:start position:0%
and save some money vote green thank you
Mr

05:52:50.708 --> 05:52:50.718 align:start position:0%
Mr
 
05:52:52.670 --> 05:52:52.680 align:start position:0%
Speaker representative McGee has
 
05:52:53.910 --> 05:52:53.920 align:start position:0%
requested a roll call is that
 
05:52:53.920 --> 05:52:56.350 align:start position:0%
requested a roll call is that
sufficiently

05:52:56.350 --> 05:52:56.360 align:start position:0%
sufficiently
 
05:52:59.150 --> 05:52:59.160 align:start position:0%
seconded you need to stand
 
05:53:02.070 --> 05:53:02.080 align:start position:0%
up it is sufficiently seconded this will
 
05:53:05.430 --> 05:53:05.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:52.750 --> 05:53:52.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:54.830 --> 05:53:54.840 align:start position:0%
the motion before us is ought to pass on
 
05:53:56.350 --> 05:53:56.360 align:start position:0%
house buillt
 
05:53:59.548 --> 05:53:59.558 align:start position:0%
723 this is going to be a roll call vote
 
05:54:01.270 --> 05:54:01.280 align:start position:0%
chair recognize representative McGee for
 
05:54:03.670 --> 05:54:03.680 align:start position:0%
a parliamentary
 
05:54:08.390 --> 05:54:08.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:11.270 --> 05:54:11.280 align:start position:0%
if I know that rate payers lose if we
 
05:54:13.628 --> 05:54:13.638 align:start position:0%
kill this project before we secure the
 
05:54:15.510 --> 05:54:15.520 align:start position:0%
cost benefit analysis that we have been
 
05:54:18.310 --> 05:54:18.320 align:start position:0%
working towards for quite some
 
05:54:21.190 --> 05:54:21.200 align:start position:0%
time and if I know that there is a
 
05:54:23.310 --> 05:54:23.320 align:start position:0%
process in place for that decision to be
 
05:54:25.708 --> 05:54:25.718 align:start position:0%
made at the Public Utilities Commission
 
05:54:27.910 --> 05:54:27.920 align:start position:0%
and so we do not have to kill it here
 
05:54:30.390 --> 05:54:30.400 align:start position:0%
today if I know that in an Information
 
05:54:32.948 --> 05:54:32.958 align:start position:0%
Age unlocking data invites innovators to
 
05:54:35.150 --> 05:54:35.160 align:start position:0%
create solutions that are not available
 
05:54:37.350 --> 05:54:37.360 align:start position:0%
today to help us save
 
05:54:40.708 --> 05:54:40.718 align:start position:0%
money but the New Hampshire data Hub has
 
05:54:42.910 --> 05:54:42.920 align:start position:0%
tangible ways to save people money
 
05:54:45.110 --> 05:54:45.120 align:start position:0%
without those future future savings that
 
05:54:48.430 --> 05:54:48.440 align:start position:0%
we haven't identified yet and finally if
 
05:54:51.110 --> 05:54:51.120 align:start position:0%
I know that together we can overturn the
 
05:54:54.468 --> 05:54:54.478 align:start position:0%
OTP and move on to an itl so that the
 
05:54:56.230 --> 05:54:56.240 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire this New Hampshire Tech
 
05:54:59.590 --> 05:54:59.600 align:start position:0%
project uh that we could all be proud of
 
05:55:02.230 --> 05:55:02.240 align:start position:0%
uh is not derailed today at the 11th
 
05:55:05.110 --> 05:55:05.120 align:start position:0%
hour after a lot of work has been put in
 
05:55:07.390 --> 05:55:07.400 align:start position:0%
by all of the parties involved D then
 
05:55:09.390 --> 05:55:09.400 align:start position:0%
would I now press the red button to
 
05:55:11.270 --> 05:55:11.280 align:start position:0%
thank those who did this work and let
 
05:55:14.430 --> 05:55:14.440 align:start position:0%
them uh and give them a chance to prove
 
05:55:16.190 --> 05:55:16.200 align:start position:0%
that they can bring Energy savings to
 
05:55:18.390 --> 05:55:18.400 align:start position:0%
Granite the granite state thank
 
05:55:20.708 --> 05:55:20.718 align:start position:0%
you chair calls representative Doug
 
05:55:26.468 --> 05:55:26.478 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:30.350 --> 05:55:30.360 align:start position:0%
inquiry thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker
 
05:55:32.670 --> 05:55:32.680 align:start position:0%
if I know if I know it's been six years
 
05:55:34.750 --> 05:55:34.760 align:start position:0%
since this bill was enacted and nothing
 
05:55:37.548 --> 05:55:37.558 align:start position:0%
has been built yet if I also know that
 
05:55:40.708 --> 05:55:40.718 align:start position:0%
this bill circumvents the normal cost
 
05:55:43.788 --> 05:55:43.798 align:start position:0%
benefit justification process and if I
 
05:55:46.910 --> 05:55:46.920 align:start position:0%
know the benefits are still unclear and
 
05:55:49.788 --> 05:55:49.798 align:start position:0%
that the installation costs alone are
 
05:55:52.190 --> 05:55:52.200 align:start position:0%
between $4.5 and7
 
05:55:55.350 --> 05:55:55.360 align:start position:0%
million uh and God knows how much more
 
05:55:58.270 --> 05:55:58.280 align:start position:0%
then Mr Speaker would I then press the
 
05:56:01.030 --> 05:56:01.040 align:start position:0%
green button and repeal this Bill thank
 
05:56:04.070 --> 05:56:04.080 align:start position:0%

05:59:02.910 --> 05:59:02.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:07.350 --> 05:59:07.360 align:start position:0%
Speaker all right thank you Mr Speaker
 
05:59:10.708 --> 05:59:10.718 align:start position:0%
at first glance hcr1 appears benign and
 
05:59:13.230 --> 05:59:13.240 align:start position:0%
in all honesty it sounds like a good
 
05:59:15.350 --> 05:59:15.360 align:start position:0%
smart and fair measure to
 
05:59:18.628 --> 05:59:18.638 align:start position:0%
have yet the title is deceiving and the
 
05:59:21.750 --> 05:59:21.760 align:start position:0%
true intent is the exact opposite many
 
05:59:24.830 --> 05:59:24.840 align:start position:0%
of us intend attend hearings listen to
 
05:59:28.910 --> 05:59:28.920 align:start position:0%
all listen and read to all testimony the
 
05:59:31.830 --> 05:59:31.840 align:start position:0%
text provides only baseless accusations
 
05:59:34.910 --> 05:59:34.920 align:start position:0%
with no reliable evidence to back it up
 
05:59:36.868 --> 05:59:36.878 align:start position:0%
none of us need made a
 
05:59:39.390 --> 05:59:39.400 align:start position:0%
resolution that prematurely assigns
 
05:59:42.750 --> 05:59:42.760 align:start position:0%
intent on our behalf On Any Given issue
 
05:59:45.270 --> 05:59:45.280 align:start position:0%
each piece of legislation is unique and
 
05:59:48.270 --> 05:59:48.280 align:start position:0%
deserves to be looked at objectively in
 
05:59:50.868 --> 05:59:50.878 align:start position:0%
the time by the through since the time
 
05:59:54.110 --> 05:59:54.120 align:start position:0%
of its Inception in an August Granite
 
05:59:58.190 --> 05:59:58.200 align:start position:0%
State poll 41% of Republicans ages 18 to
 
06:00:02.030 --> 06:00:02.040 align:start position:0%
34 said climate change was human cost in
 
06:00:04.230 --> 06:00:04.240 align:start position:0%
fact polling suggests that younger
 
06:00:07.030 --> 06:00:07.040 align:start position:0%
voters of any age bracket regardless of
 
06:00:09.430 --> 06:00:09.440 align:start position:0%
political party are prioritizing the
 
06:00:12.350 --> 06:00:12.360 align:start position:0%
environment in climate change when it
 
06:00:14.190 --> 06:00:14.200 align:start position:0%
comes to their views on climate
 
06:00:16.270 --> 06:00:16.280 align:start position:0%
two-thirds of younger Republicans
 
06:00:18.230 --> 06:00:18.240 align:start position:0%
acknowledge that human activity
 
06:00:20.590 --> 06:00:20.600 align:start position:0%
contributes to climate change there
 
06:00:22.750 --> 06:00:22.760 align:start position:0%
comes a point where evidence is truly
 
06:00:26.270 --> 06:00:26.280 align:start position:0%
overwhelming and hard to ignore hcr1 is
 
06:00:28.350 --> 06:00:28.360 align:start position:0%
nothing more than a last ditch attempt
 
06:00:30.750 --> 06:00:30.760 align:start position:0%
to have the last word when your argument
 
06:00:34.190 --> 06:00:34.200 align:start position:0%
is a losing one thank
 
06:00:45.310 --> 06:00:45.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:47.670 --> 06:00:47.680 align:start position:0%
Moffett thank you Mr
 
06:00:50.788 --> 06:00:50.798 align:start position:0%
Speaker Mr Speaker this resolution
 
06:00:55.310 --> 06:00:55.320 align:start position:0%
simply calls for all voices to be heard
 
06:00:57.390 --> 06:00:57.400 align:start position:0%
as we develop climate
 
06:01:00.948 --> 06:01:00.958 align:start position:0%
policy bill has been public the
 
06:01:02.510 --> 06:01:02.520 align:start position:0%
committee reports are public you can
 
06:01:05.670 --> 06:01:05.680 align:start position:0%
read those so why is this important that
 
06:01:09.190 --> 06:01:09.200 align:start position:0%
all voices be heard well climate
 
06:01:12.548 --> 06:01:12.558 align:start position:0%
alarmists and extremists have long been
 
06:01:15.468 --> 06:01:15.478 align:start position:0%
very successful in defining the climate
 
06:01:17.910 --> 06:01:17.920 align:start position:0%
narrative on their
 
06:01:21.548 --> 06:01:21.558 align:start position:0%
terms hysterical claims abound I won't
 
06:01:23.590 --> 06:01:23.600 align:start position:0%
go through them you've heard a lot of
 
06:01:26.948 --> 06:01:26.958 align:start position:0%
them and we're constantly told there's a
 
06:01:26.958 --> 06:01:28.390 align:start position:0%
them and we're constantly told there's a
climate

06:01:28.390 --> 06:01:28.400 align:start position:0%
climate
 
06:01:31.548 --> 06:01:31.558 align:start position:0%
consensus among scientists but in 2023 a
 
06:01:33.390 --> 06:01:33.400 align:start position:0%
list of
 
06:01:37.190 --> 06:01:37.200 align:start position:0%
169 scientists Scholars and others this
 
06:01:39.110 --> 06:01:39.120 align:start position:0%
list was released and these folks said
 
06:01:43.868 --> 06:01:43.878 align:start position:0%
quote there is no climate emergency
 
06:01:46.110 --> 06:01:46.120 align:start position:0%
unquote of particular interest to our
 
06:01:47.948 --> 06:01:47.958 align:start position:0%
state federal and veterans committee
 
06:01:51.270 --> 06:01:51.280 align:start position:0%
were efforts to force our
 
06:01:54.750 --> 06:01:54.760 align:start position:0%
military to military aircraft to use
 
06:01:57.628 --> 06:01:57.638 align:start position:0%
biofuel which is much more expensive
 
06:01:59.750 --> 06:01:59.760 align:start position:0%
it's more climate friendly but much more
 
06:02:03.310 --> 06:02:03.320 align:start position:0%
expensive and it's problematical for for
 
06:02:05.948 --> 06:02:05.958 align:start position:0%
uh air Air Force and and Aviation for
 
06:02:09.910 --> 06:02:09.920 align:start position:0%
folks or to mandate battery powered
 
06:02:09.920 --> 06:02:10.990 align:start position:0%
folks or to mandate battery powered
tactical

06:02:10.990 --> 06:02:11.000 align:start position:0%
tactical
 
06:02:14.350 --> 06:02:14.360 align:start position:0%
Vehicles so when the climate crae
 
06:02:16.030 --> 06:02:16.040 align:start position:0%
threatens National Security we need to
 
06:02:19.230 --> 06:02:19.240 align:start position:0%
take notice California even as you
 
06:02:21.190 --> 06:02:21.200 align:start position:0%
probably heard California has even
 
06:02:23.868 --> 06:02:23.878 align:start position:0%
passed a law Banning the sale of gas
 
06:02:26.150 --> 06:02:26.160 align:start position:0%
powerered cars in 10 years
 
06:02:29.708 --> 06:02:29.718 align:start position:0%
2035 many want New Hampshire to
 
06:02:33.468 --> 06:02:33.478 align:start position:0%
follow next door in Vermont lawmakers uh
 
06:02:35.830 --> 06:02:35.840 align:start position:0%
did some really radical climate leg
 
06:02:37.750 --> 06:02:37.760 align:start position:0%
legislating two years
 
06:02:40.350 --> 06:02:40.360 align:start position:0%
ago people want New Hampshire to follow
 
06:02:43.270 --> 06:02:43.280 align:start position:0%
suit in Vermont they want the energy
 
06:02:46.468 --> 06:02:46.478 align:start position:0%
companies to pay to pay big time for
 
06:02:48.750 --> 06:02:48.760 align:start position:0%
changing Vermont's
 
06:02:51.390 --> 06:02:51.400 align:start position:0%
climate so here in this body or in any
 
06:02:53.910 --> 06:02:53.920 align:start position:0%
legislative body we often asked to
 
06:02:56.788 --> 06:02:56.798 align:start position:0%
impose higher electric rates as the
 
06:02:59.030 --> 06:02:59.040 align:start position:0%
folks in Science and Tech know so well
 
06:03:01.510 --> 06:03:01.520 align:start position:0%
to subsidize questionable climate
 
06:03:04.390 --> 06:03:04.400 align:start position:0%
initiatives fortunately we've been able
 
06:03:06.670 --> 06:03:06.680 align:start position:0%
to resist much of that
 
06:03:08.628 --> 06:03:08.638 align:start position:0%
pressure but here in New Hampshire not
 
06:03:10.430 --> 06:03:10.440 align:start position:0%
so long ago in this very body a bill
 
06:03:12.708 --> 06:03:12.718 align:start position:0%
came to the to this body to Outlaw to
 
06:03:15.868 --> 06:03:15.878 align:start position:0%
ban wood stoves in New Hampshire I'm
 
06:03:17.708 --> 06:03:17.718 align:start position:0%
from Coos County and from gron we had a
 
06:03:19.708 --> 06:03:19.718 align:start position:0%
wood stove we had a wood my dad put it
 
06:03:20.830 --> 06:03:20.840 align:start position:0%
in a wood
 
06:03:23.230 --> 06:03:23.240 align:start position:0%
furnace so the movement to take away
 
06:03:25.670 --> 06:03:25.680 align:start position:0%
wood stoves or or furnaces and that type
 
06:03:27.590 --> 06:03:27.600 align:start position:0%
of thing of which there are so many
 
06:03:28.910 --> 06:03:28.920 align:start position:0%
proposals and
 
06:03:32.910 --> 06:03:32.920 align:start position:0%
ideas uh especially like in
 
06:03:36.750 --> 06:03:36.760 align:start position:0%
schools and the flip side of those argu
 
06:03:38.590 --> 06:03:38.600 align:start position:0%
are hard to get out
 
06:03:41.430 --> 06:03:41.440 align:start position:0%
there then there are the carbon credit
 
06:03:43.708 --> 06:03:43.718 align:start position:0%
or carbon allowance
 
06:03:46.750 --> 06:03:46.760 align:start position:0%
issues the United Nations assigns carbon
 
06:03:48.548 --> 06:03:48.558 align:start position:0%
credit formulas to various countries who
 
06:03:50.548 --> 06:03:50.558 align:start position:0%
are supposed to monitor carbon emissions
 
06:03:53.910 --> 06:03:53.920 align:start position:0%
and report back to the UN organizations
 
06:03:56.628 --> 06:03:56.638 align:start position:0%
can buy or sell carbon credits 13 states
 
06:03:58.230 --> 06:03:58.240 align:start position:0%
many of our neighbors are involved in
 
06:04:01.310 --> 06:04:01.320 align:start position:0%
cap and trade I would submit that such
 
06:04:03.788 --> 06:04:03.798 align:start position:0%
programs have zero impact on our climate
 
06:04:06.230 --> 06:04:06.240 align:start position:0%
but they do make electric rat rates
 
06:04:08.628 --> 06:04:08.638 align:start position:0%
higher and many climate activists as
 
06:04:10.670 --> 06:04:10.680 align:start position:0%
you've heard fly around the world in in
 
06:04:12.510 --> 06:04:12.520 align:start position:0%
Jets now they leave massive carbon
 
06:04:15.110 --> 06:04:15.120 align:start position:0%
Footprints so to counter that they plant
 
06:04:18.910 --> 06:04:18.920 align:start position:0%
trees to offset their carbon use or or
 
06:04:21.150 --> 06:04:21.160 align:start position:0%
they buy Forest they plant trees to buy
 
06:04:23.230 --> 06:04:23.240 align:start position:0%
forest and why does that matter to us
 
06:04:26.670 --> 06:04:26.680 align:start position:0%
well out of state entity purchases in
 
06:04:29.670 --> 06:04:29.680 align:start position:0%
Coos County they purchased 146,000 Acres
 
06:04:33.468 --> 06:04:33.478 align:start position:0%
of Forest in Coos County my home my
 
06:04:36.430 --> 06:04:36.440 align:start position:0%
original home county to engage carbon
 
06:04:39.430 --> 06:04:39.440 align:start position:0%
offsets and even sell carbon credits so
 
06:04:41.990 --> 06:04:42.000 align:start position:0%
they've taken the forest land up north
 
06:04:43.750 --> 06:04:43.760 align:start position:0%
and it's it's no longer available for
 
06:04:47.510 --> 06:04:47.520 align:start position:0%
Tim Timber use it's for carbon credits
 
06:04:49.510 --> 06:04:49.520 align:start position:0%
and carbon
 
06:04:52.788 --> 06:04:52.798 align:start position:0%
offsets so it's hard to raise awareness
 
06:04:55.310 --> 06:04:55.320 align:start position:0%
about the dangers of climate extremism
 
06:04:57.628 --> 06:04:57.638 align:start position:0%
when the media the so-called clean
 
06:05:01.230 --> 06:05:01.240 align:start position:0%
energy Industries lawmakers academics
 
06:05:03.670 --> 06:05:03.680 align:start position:0%
and alarmists control the
 
06:05:06.110 --> 06:05:06.120 align:start position:0%
narrative when they join Force and when
 
06:05:08.510 --> 06:05:08.520 align:start position:0%
they qu when people like
 
06:05:08.520 --> 06:05:10.230 align:start position:0%
they qu when people like
me

06:05:10.230 --> 06:05:10.240 align:start position:0%
me
 
06:05:14.430 --> 06:05:14.440 align:start position:0%
question the extent of of man's impact
 
06:05:19.070 --> 06:05:19.080 align:start position:0%
on climate uh we get called deniers so
 
06:05:20.868 --> 06:05:20.878 align:start position:0%
let's stop bullying people who are
 
06:05:24.230 --> 06:05:24.240 align:start position:0%
skeptical of some of the climate claims
 
06:05:28.190 --> 06:05:28.200 align:start position:0%
the the this resolution simply calls for
 
06:05:30.868 --> 06:05:30.878 align:start position:0%
all voices to be heard and I'll close
 
06:05:32.350 --> 06:05:32.360 align:start position:0%
with a personal example some of you know
 
06:05:35.350 --> 06:05:35.360 align:start position:0%
that I I do opinion pieces I write I had
 
06:05:37.110 --> 06:05:37.120 align:start position:0%
something in today's union leader for
 
06:05:40.190 --> 06:05:40.200 align:start position:0%
example but when I write about climate I
 
06:05:42.190 --> 06:05:42.200 align:start position:0%
can't often times I'll I'll try to
 
06:05:44.190 --> 06:05:44.200 align:start position:0%
counter some climate perspective with a
 
06:05:45.990 --> 06:05:46.000 align:start position:0%
different climate perspective and I
 
06:05:48.548 --> 06:05:48.558 align:start position:0%
can't get it published as as a personal
 
06:05:52.390 --> 06:05:52.400 align:start position:0%
example and yet a 15-year-old Swedish
 
06:05:55.430 --> 06:05:55.440 align:start position:0%
activist and Greta Thum got to address
 
06:05:57.990 --> 06:05:58.000 align:start position:0%
the United Nations so that's the type of
 
06:06:00.230 --> 06:06:00.240 align:start position:0%
thing we're talking about or or AOC was
 
06:06:03.190 --> 06:06:03.200 align:start position:0%
the head of the green New Deal she was a
 
06:06:06.708 --> 06:06:06.718 align:start position:0%

from areas that have these two-lane
 
06:12:55.830 --> 06:12:55.840 align:start position:0%
roads winding through the hills they
 
06:12:58.590 --> 06:12:58.600 align:start position:0%
they go up and down they go

we're used to in uh New Hampshire you
 
06:13:18.990 --> 06:13:19.000 align:start position:0%
know in New Hampshire they say if you
 
06:13:22.030 --> 06:13:22.040 align:start position:0%
don't like the weather just wait a
 
06:13:24.750 --> 06:13:24.760 align:start position:0%
minute that being said they're getting
 
06:13:28.310 --> 06:13:28.320 align:start position:0%
closer her wipers are on they get to 900
 
06:13:30.628 --> 06:13:30.638 align:start position:0%
ft if her lights are on they would have
 
06:13:33.030 --> 06:13:33.040 align:start position:0%
saw each other but they
 
06:13:36.310 --> 06:13:36.320 align:start position:0%
don't they get to 700 F feet they still
 
06:13:38.788 --> 06:13:38.798 align:start position:0%
don't see each other they get to 400
 
06:13:42.270 --> 06:13:42.280 align:start position:0%
feet they don't see each other at 100 ft
 
06:13:44.468 --> 06:13:44.478 align:start position:0%
they finally see each other but it's too
 
06:13:46.788 --> 06:13:46.798 align:start position:0%
late to
 
06:13:53.868 --> 06:13:53.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:56.070 --> 06:13:56.080 align:start position:0%
Deere as I
 
06:13:58.270 --> 06:13:58.280 align:start position:0%
say 18
 
06:14:01.030 --> 06:14:01.040 align:start position:0%
states have this including our New
 
06:14:03.830 --> 06:14:03.840 align:start position:0%
England neighbors of Connecticut Maine

06:14:20.390 --> 06:14:20.400 align:start position:0%
Island there was a there was a study
 
06:14:23.948 --> 06:14:23.958 align:start position:0%
done for uh daytime use of Automotive
 
06:14:26.230 --> 06:14:26.240 align:start position:0%
headlamps storing inclement
 
06:14:28.590 --> 06:14:28.600 align:start position:0%
weather was conducted by the lighting
 
06:14:31.468 --> 06:14:31.478 align:start position:0%
research center of the renier Poly
 
06:14:33.030 --> 06:14:33.040 align:start position:0%

country
 
06:14:37.110 --> 06:14:37.120 align:start position:0%
and they
 
06:14:39.788 --> 06:14:39.798 align:start position:0%
compared data from seven
 
06:14:42.350 --> 06:14:42.360 align:start position:0%
states and in that data what they looked
 
06:14:47.708 --> 06:14:47.718 align:start position:0%
at was a defined time before and after
 
06:14:50.270 --> 06:14:50.280 align:start position:0%
they passed these
 
06:14:53.150 --> 06:14:53.160 align:start position:0%
statutes and what they found
 
06:14:56.628 --> 06:14:56.638 align:start position:0%
was the results showed that there was a
 
06:15:00.468 --> 06:15:00.478 align:start position:0%
7% deduction in fatal
 
06:15:03.430 --> 06:15:03.440 align:start position:0%
accidents during daytime inclement
 
06:15:06.390 --> 06:15:06.400 align:start position:0%
weather and a third 30%
 
06:15:10.670 --> 06:15:10.680 align:start position:0%
deduction in in fatal accidents during
 
06:15:13.430 --> 06:15:13.440 align:start position:0%
Dusk and
 
06:15:19.750 --> 06:15:19.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:21.990 --> 06:15:22.000 align:start position:0%
reduction now we all
 
06:15:24.670 --> 06:15:24.680 align:start position:0%
have people on the roads that we love
 
06:15:27.270 --> 06:15:27.280 align:start position:0%

testimony throughout the period we heard
 
06:21:40.548 --> 06:21:40.558 align:start position:0%
we all received I assume you all got
 
06:21:43.350 --> 06:21:43.360 align:start position:0%
them all of those emails from all of our
 
06:21:43.360 --> 06:21:44.948 align:start position:0%
them all of those emails from all of our
constituents

06:21:44.948 --> 06:21:44.958 align:start position:0%
constituents
 
06:21:48.830 --> 06:21:48.840 align:start position:0%
frustrated by the inspection program we
 
06:21:52.628 --> 06:21:52.638 align:start position:0%
know it is broken we know it needs to be
 
06:21:56.750 --> 06:21:56.760 align:start position:0%
reworked we want to fix it this bill is
 
06:21:58.430 --> 06:21:58.440 align:start position:0%
not the correct
 
06:22:02.190 --> 06:22:02.200 align:start position:0%
fix we had the opportunity uh from the
 
06:22:04.670 --> 06:22:04.680 align:start position:0%
author of the bill to work with them to
 
06:22:06.708 --> 06:22:06.718 align:start position:0%
address many of the shortcomings we saw
 
06:22:09.230 --> 06:22:09.240 align:start position:0%
in it uh or we had the offer we did not
 
06:22:10.670 --> 06:22:10.680 align:start position:0%
have the opportunity we did not get the
 
06:22:13.070 --> 06:22:13.080 align:start position:0%
time to work with them to resolve those
 
06:22:15.230 --> 06:22:15.240 align:start position:0%
issues during the bill during the uh
 
06:22:17.990 --> 06:22:18.000 align:start position:0%
process it was pushed to a vote and here
 
06:22:18.000 --> 06:22:18.910 align:start position:0%
process it was pushed to a vote and here
we

06:22:18.910 --> 06:22:18.920 align:start position:0%
we
 
06:22:22.510 --> 06:22:22.520 align:start position:0%
are most notably there's a significant
 
06:22:25.430 --> 06:22:25.440 align:start position:0%
financial risk to the state the way this
 
06:22:27.708 --> 06:22:27.718 align:start position:0%
bill is written we currently have an
 
06:22:29.230 --> 06:22:29.240 align:start position:0%
agreement with the Department of
 
06:22:31.070 --> 06:22:31.080 align:start position:0%
Transportation and the Environmental
 
06:22:31.080 --> 06:22:32.468 align:start position:0%

06:22:35.788 --> 06:22:35.798 align:start position:0%
Agency that leads if we come out of
 
06:22:37.990 --> 06:22:38.000 align:start position:0%
compliance with an EPA mandate for
 
06:22:40.590 --> 06:22:40.600 align:start position:0%
emissions testing we are putting as much
 
06:22:44.468 --> 06:22:44.478 align:start position:0%
as $200 million a year in do funding at
 
06:22:47.548 --> 06:22:47.558 align:start position:0%
risk I don't know if it'll happen I
 
06:22:49.110 --> 06:22:49.120 align:start position:0%
don't know if the do will take it away I
 
06:22:50.468 --> 06:22:50.478 align:start position:0%
don't know if the do will still exist
 
06:22:51.868 --> 06:22:51.878 align:start position:0%
assum the EPA will still exist to take
 
06:22:55.708 --> 06:22:55.718 align:start position:0%
it away but it is an unacceptable risk
 
06:22:58.310 --> 06:22:58.320 align:start position:0%
at this point to not account for that
 
06:23:00.070 --> 06:23:00.080 align:start position:0%
especially given our financial position
 
06:23:02.430 --> 06:23:02.440 align:start position:0%
and therefore I encourage you to vote uh
 
06:23:04.230 --> 06:23:04.240 align:start position:0%
against the ought to pass for this so
 
06:23:06.628 --> 06:23:06.638 align:start position:0%
that have an opportunity to fix the bill
 
06:23:08.390 --> 06:23:08.400 align:start position:0%
and make it work better for the granite
 
06:23:17.270 --> 06:23:17.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:20.628 --> 06:23:20.638 align:start position:0%
for thank you Mr
 
06:23:22.868 --> 06:23:22.878 align:start position:0%
Speaker I come to before the body today
 
06:23:24.590 --> 06:23:24.600 align:start position:0%
in support of House Bill
 
06:23:27.270 --> 06:23:27.280 align:start position:0%
649 which would overturn the so-called
 
06:23:29.670 --> 06:23:29.680 align:start position:0%
safety inspections on vehicles on public
 
06:23:32.190 --> 06:23:32.200 align:start position:0%
roadways New Hampshire is one of only 10
 
06:23:35.030 --> 06:23:35.040 align:start position:0%
states left that have a law such as this
 
06:23:36.948 --> 06:23:36.958 align:start position:0%
40 states don't have it or have passed
 
06:23:38.270 --> 06:23:38.280 align:start position:0%
to get rid of
 
06:23:41.830 --> 06:23:41.840 align:start position:0%
it research has shown that there is not
 
06:23:44.468 --> 06:23:44.478 align:start position:0%
a significant disparity in injury or
 
06:23:46.910 --> 06:23:46.920 align:start position:0%
lethality accidents between states that
 
06:23:49.310 --> 06:23:49.320 align:start position:0%
do and do not have inspections such as
 
06:23:53.788 --> 06:23:53.798 align:start position:0%
this indeed there is no clear presence
 
06:23:55.788 --> 06:23:55.798 align:start position:0%
of danger to the
 
06:23:58.910 --> 06:23:58.920 align:start position:0%
public so I'll ask a question who is
 
06:24:00.750 --> 06:24:00.760 align:start position:0%
responsible for the safe operation of
 
06:24:04.070 --> 06:24:04.080 align:start position:0%
their motor vehicle the operator is the
 
06:24:04.080 --> 06:24:05.708 align:start position:0%
their motor vehicle the operator is the
owner

06:24:05.708 --> 06:24:05.718 align:start position:0%
owner
 
06:24:09.270 --> 06:24:09.280 align:start position:0%
is there should not be a business of
 
06:24:11.628 --> 06:24:11.638 align:start position:0%
supplementing Private Industry under
 
06:24:14.430 --> 06:24:14.440 align:start position:0%
penalty of law and fines this is
 
06:24:17.230 --> 06:24:17.240 align:start position:0%
especially true when this law or policy
 
06:24:18.910 --> 06:24:18.920 align:start position:0%
is questioned based on ethics
 
06:24:20.948 --> 06:24:20.958 align:start position:0%
transparency and equal
 
06:24:22.910 --> 06:24:22.920 align:start position:0%
application in terms of ethics and
 
06:24:25.030 --> 06:24:25.040 align:start position:0%
transparency while there is a reporting
 
06:24:29.110 --> 06:24:29.120 align:start position:0%
method to report an impropriety or a
 
06:24:31.350 --> 06:24:31.360 align:start position:0%
questionable inspection it's not known
 
06:24:34.030 --> 06:24:34.040 align:start position:0%
by much of the public in fact there was
 
06:24:36.270 --> 06:24:36.280 align:start position:0%
test only only 60 people had put in
 
06:24:39.510 --> 06:24:39.520 align:start position:0%
complaints last year also if you want a
 
06:24:41.788 --> 06:24:41.798 align:start position:0%
second opinion many shops will not
 
06:24:43.590 --> 06:24:43.600 align:start position:0%
inspect a car that has been declined
 
06:24:45.548 --> 06:24:45.558 align:start position:0%
somewhere else because they don't want
 
06:24:48.788 --> 06:24:48.798 align:start position:0%
to be investigated for how they're doing
 
06:24:51.110 --> 06:24:51.120 align:start position:0%
inspections as far as equal application
 
06:24:53.910 --> 06:24:53.920 align:start position:0%
under law we've heard from voters of all
 
06:24:57.190 --> 06:24:57.200 align:start position:0%
demographics they don't feel like it is
 
06:24:59.390 --> 06:24:59.400 align:start position:0%
equally applied it disproportionately
 
06:25:02.030 --> 06:25:02.040 align:start position:0%
affects the less financially secure and
 
06:25:04.468 --> 06:25:04.478 align:start position:0%
I'll ask one other question do any any
 
06:25:06.868 --> 06:25:06.878 align:start position:0%
of you know of any single woman or
 
06:25:09.468 --> 06:25:09.478 align:start position:0%
elderly person who feels like they were
 
06:25:09.478 --> 06:25:10.150 align:start position:0%
elderly person who feels like they were
the

06:25:10.150 --> 06:25:10.160 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:25:13.310 --> 06:25:13.320 align:start position:0%
victim of predatory business practices
 
06:25:15.708 --> 06:25:15.718 align:start position:0%
in the inspection
 
06:25:19.110 --> 06:25:19.120 align:start position:0%
law the fact that this is possibly the
 
06:25:20.830 --> 06:25:20.840 align:start position:0%
most unpopular law that exists in the
 
06:25:22.270 --> 06:25:22.280 align:start position:0%
books of the State of New
 
06:25:24.750 --> 06:25:24.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and has the public out crying
 
06:25:28.430 --> 06:25:28.440 align:start position:0%
us uh for us to overturn it and move the
 
06:25:30.430 --> 06:25:30.440 align:start position:0%
liability back to the owner and away
 
06:25:32.708 --> 06:25:32.718 align:start position:0%
from the false sense of security of the
 
06:25:35.070 --> 06:25:35.080 align:start position:0%
inspector should speak
 
06:25:37.708 --> 06:25:37.718 align:start position:0%
volumes now also in speaking with the
 
06:25:39.310 --> 06:25:39.320 align:start position:0%
members of the House Transportation
 
06:25:41.070 --> 06:25:41.080 align:start position:0%
committee we've been trying to throw
 
06:25:44.150 --> 06:25:44.160 align:start position:0%
guard rails on this for years now little
 
06:25:46.910 --> 06:25:46.920 align:start position:0%
pun intended yes but as long as it
 
06:25:49.788 --> 06:25:49.798 align:start position:0%
stands as it's passed under RSA 541a
 
06:25:51.468 --> 06:25:51.478 align:start position:0%
which is allowed it to do its own rules
 
06:25:53.150 --> 06:25:53.160 align:start position:0%
writing and expand its own program
 
06:25:54.990 --> 06:25:55.000 align:start position:0%
without legislative uh without this
 
06:25:55.000 --> 06:25:56.110 align:start position:0%
without legislative uh without this
legislative

06:25:56.110 --> 06:25:56.120 align:start position:0%
legislative
 
06:25:58.750 --> 06:25:58.760 align:start position:0%
body you are no longer in control of
 
06:26:01.110 --> 06:26:01.120 align:start position:0%
this law and you haven't been for a long
 
06:26:03.670 --> 06:26:03.680 align:start position:0%
time so when the majority of our uh
 
06:26:05.628 --> 06:26:05.638 align:start position:0%
constituents are begging us to overturn
 
06:26:07.750 --> 06:26:07.760 align:start position:0%
this and when we know that we're no
 
06:26:10.030 --> 06:26:10.040 align:start position:0%
longer in control of it I believe that
 
06:26:11.708 --> 06:26:11.718 align:start position:0%
it is our duty to pass this and I hope
 
06:26:12.990 --> 06:26:13.000 align:start position:0%
that you will join me in pressing the
 
06:26:13.000 --> 06:26:16.390 align:start position:0%
that you will join me in pressing the
green

06:26:16.390 --> 06:26:16.400 align:start position:0%

06:26:32.548 --> 06:26:32.558 align:start position:0%
seconded it is sufficiently seconded
 
06:26:35.628 --> 06:26:35.638 align:start position:0%
this will be a
 
06:27:03.150 --> 06:27:03.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:27:49.628 --> 06:27:49.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:27:51.510 --> 06:27:51.520 align:start position:0%

06:28:04.948 --> 06:28:04.958 align:start position:0%
inquiry thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker
 
06:28:06.430 --> 06:28:06.440 align:start position:0%
if I know that there's bipartisan
 
06:28:08.270 --> 06:28:08.280 align:start position:0%
agreement that the State motor vehicle
 
06:28:10.990 --> 06:28:11.000 align:start position:0%
safety inspection program needs reform
 
06:28:12.390 --> 06:28:12.400 align:start position:0%
and if I know that when enacting that
 
06:28:13.948 --> 06:28:13.958 align:start position:0%
reform we should be careful to avoid
 
06:28:16.430 --> 06:28:16.440 align:start position:0%
unint unintended consequences like
 
06:28:17.910 --> 06:28:17.920 align:start position:0%
eliminating the emissions program and
 
06:28:19.150 --> 06:28:19.160 align:start position:0%
potentially causing problems with the
 
06:28:21.670 --> 06:28:21.680 align:start position:0%
EPA by taking a scalpel to the program
 
06:28:24.110 --> 06:28:24.120 align:start position:0%
rather than a sledgehammer and if I know
 
06:28:25.468 --> 06:28:25.478 align:start position:0%
that the transportation committee
 
06:28:27.750 --> 06:28:27.760 align:start position:0%
retained HB 209 a bill that be will be
 
06:28:29.150 --> 06:28:29.160 align:start position:0%
worked on this summer and is a much
 
06:28:31.670 --> 06:28:31.680 align:start position:0%
better scalpel than this bill would I
 
06:28:33.390 --> 06:28:33.400 align:start position:0%
now press the red button to defeat the
 
06:28:35.830 --> 06:28:35.840 align:start position:0%

inquir Mr Speaker if you and my
 
06:28:48.230 --> 06:28:48.240 align:start position:0%
colleagues who've been around for a
 
06:28:51.310 --> 06:28:51.320 align:start position:0%
while recall seeing me for years stand
 
06:28:54.310 --> 06:28:54.320 align:start position:0%
here and defend the inspection program
 
06:28:56.830 --> 06:28:56.840 align:start position:0%
well if I know I can't do that anymore
 
06:28:59.708 --> 06:28:59.718 align:start position:0%
because over those years I have tried to
 
06:29:01.310 --> 06:29:01.320 align:start position:0%
get reasonable
 
06:29:04.590 --> 06:29:04.600 align:start position:0%
reforms if I know that I put a Statute
 
06:29:06.670 --> 06:29:06.680 align:start position:0%
in that said you can't be failed for
 
06:29:08.590 --> 06:29:08.600 align:start position:0%
cosmetic rust cuz damn it you have the
 
06:29:11.788 --> 06:29:11.798 align:start position:0%
right to drive an ugly vehicle in New
 
06:29:14.270 --> 06:29:14.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and despite that the
 
06:29:15.990 --> 06:29:16.000 align:start position:0%
department of safety and the shops have
 
06:29:17.948 --> 06:29:17.958 align:start position:0%
ignored the statute which was effective
 
06:29:20.788 --> 06:29:20.798 align:start position:0%
on passage and that today people are
 
06:29:23.270 --> 06:29:23.280 align:start position:0%
still being failed for something that is
 
06:29:26.910 --> 06:29:26.920 align:start position:0%
the law Mr Speaker if I know I've tried
 
06:29:28.948 --> 06:29:28.958 align:start position:0%
to work with the industry and they have
 
06:29:31.830 --> 06:29:31.840 align:start position:0%
stopped us at every single turn and I'm
 
06:29:33.350 --> 06:29:33.360 align:start position:0%
mad as hell and I'm not going to take it
 
06:29:34.910 --> 06:29:34.920 align:start position:0%
anymore into today I want to stick up
 
06:29:37.548 --> 06:29:37.558 align:start position:0%
for my constituents then Mr Speaker
 
06:29:39.788 --> 06:29:39.798 align:start position:0%
would I press the green button to send a
 
06:29:41.548 --> 06:29:41.558 align:start position:0%
message that it's the people of New
 
06:29:43.830 --> 06:29:43.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that I'm worried about
 
06:29:47.510 --> 06:29:47.520 align:start position:0%
today house will house will be in
 
06:29:50.230 --> 06:29:50.240 align:start position:0%

been considered the same report the same

with the following resolution resolved

the towns can address public water FL
 
06:32:07.430 --> 06:32:07.440 align:start position:0%
validation via a warrant article but the
 
06:32:09.750 --> 06:32:09.760 align:start position:0%
committee did not realize that it is
 
06:32:12.468 --> 06:32:12.478 align:start position:0%
immoral to bulk medicate the whole
 
06:32:15.350 --> 06:32:15.360 align:start position:0%
population regardless of their personal
 
06:32:18.270 --> 06:32:18.280 align:start position:0%

Biden's Health agencies finally
 
06:32:30.230 --> 06:32:30.240 align:start position:0%
confirmed that fluorite is neurotoxic
 
06:32:32.708 --> 06:32:32.718 align:start position:0%
and was lowering IQ for certain
 
06:32:32.718 --> 06:32:34.468 align:start position:0%
and was lowering IQ for certain
populations

06:32:34.468 --> 06:32:34.478 align:start position:0%
populations
 
06:32:37.468 --> 06:32:37.478 align:start position:0%
finally the committee did not know that
 
06:32:41.468 --> 06:32:41.478 align:start position:0%
between the deliberation and now UT
 
06:32:44.708 --> 06:32:44.718 align:start position:0%
legislature fully Advanced identical
 
06:32:48.548 --> 06:32:48.558 align:start position:0%
legislation so we won't be the first to
 
06:32:52.510 --> 06:32:52.520 align:start position:0%
vote for it so please vote ah to fight
 
06:32:55.310 --> 06:32:55.320 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr
 
06:33:12.590 --> 06:33:12.600 align:start position:0%
Speaker so the resources Recreation and
 
06:33:13.868 --> 06:33:13.878 align:start position:0%
development committee heard broad
 
06:33:15.948 --> 06:33:15.958 align:start position:0%
testimony both in support and opposition
 
06:33:17.670 --> 06:33:17.680 align:start position:0%
regarding the science and health effects
 
06:33:20.350 --> 06:33:20.360 align:start position:0%
of these chemicals in the water system
 
06:33:23.510 --> 06:33:23.520 align:start position:0%
however the committee feels the issue
 
06:33:25.788 --> 06:33:25.798 align:start position:0%
does not need additional Superfluous
 
06:33:27.948 --> 06:33:27.958 align:start position:0%
State legislation as local communities
 
06:33:29.708 --> 06:33:29.718 align:start position:0%
served by these Water Supplies have
 
06:33:33.350 --> 06:33:33.360 align:start position:0%
local control and chose to add chemicals
 
06:33:35.310 --> 06:33:35.320 align:start position:0%
their to their water supply they also
 
06:33:37.350 --> 06:33:37.360 align:start position:0%
have the means to choose to remove these
 
06:33:39.788 --> 06:33:39.798 align:start position:0%
chemicals from the Water Supplies as
 
06:33:42.150 --> 06:33:42.160 align:start position:0%
well the committee feels that this issue
 
06:33:44.190 --> 06:33:44.200 align:start position:0%
is about local control and the committee
 
06:33:46.110 --> 06:33:46.120 align:start position:0%
recommends not adding additional
 
06:33:48.190 --> 06:33:48.200 align:start position:0%
legislation where it isn't needed thank
 
06:33:50.788 --> 06:33:50.798 align:start position:0%

before women achieve true

parody but what is
 
06:45:54.990 --> 06:45:55.000 align:start position:0%
parody is it the equal opportunity to
 
06:45:57.910 --> 06:45:57.920 align:start position:0%
speak up for yourself your safety your
 
06:46:01.430 --> 06:46:01.440 align:start position:0%

voices women thought that the kind thing
 
06:46:11.270 --> 06:46:11.280 align:start position:0%
to do was to make space and hold their
 
06:46:13.670 --> 06:46:13.680 align:start position:0%
tongues but rather than finding a
 
06:46:16.388 --> 06:46:16.398 align:start position:0%
tolerable compromise they were pushed
 
06:46:19.430 --> 06:46:19.440 align:start position:0%
another foot for every inch they gave
 
06:46:21.510 --> 06:46:21.520 align:start position:0%
they had to violate their boundaries and
 
06:46:23.590 --> 06:46:23.600 align:start position:0%
yield to men in their self-esteem while
 
06:46:27.030 --> 06:46:27.040 align:start position:0%
forsaking their own women were on a path
 
06:46:31.510 --> 06:46:31.520 align:start position:0%
